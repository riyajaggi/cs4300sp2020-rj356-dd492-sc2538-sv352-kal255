 Do you know why Dad quit his job? That is just the way he is. Something he didn't like must have happened at work. Speaking of suddenly quitting, your father wouldn't even tell me, his best friend, why he quit. Have you ever thought of quitting this company, Mr. Hakamada? It would have to be a darn serious reason for a workaholic like me to quit. Inaba, why don't you join this company? Oono, to be honest... An illness? I'm suffering from an illness.

 He must be kidding again. Dad of Light Project! This is my project to invite my father into the Final Fantasy XIV world, a place that I love, and go on spectacular adventures with him while concealing my true identity. It's my way of showing my father that I care for him! Really? Well, if it's an illness that is serious enough to make him quit work, EPISODE 6 THE TRUTH it's probably cancer. That's what I thought. What? Mr. Inaba, do you have cancer? No, not me.

 Don't tell me it's your father. No, I can't say for sure just yet. It's possible that it's something completely different. My father had cancer several years ago. He said that he couldn't decide whether he should tell us or not at first. He knew that treatment is expensive, so he didn't want to trouble us. He hid the medical test results in his room. Mom found them while cleaning. Right! That reminds me of something. When I was going through Dad's belongings, I found a book with its cover reversed. As I expected, it was porn. I can't just throw it away. What should I do with it? What? How should I know? Why don't you burn it at a shrine? That's a good idea! That way, your father can read his porn in heaven. Yes! That's perfect! Now I can do something for my father after he's dead. Thank you. Such a lovely story. By the way, what kind of porn was it? Actually, it was an erotic novel. -A novel? -A novel? What is it? Nothing. I'm done. I'm going for a little jog. Don't overdo it. You shouldn't worry too much about your weight. Mom. Dad doesn't have a disease or anything like that, does he? What? Why are you asking that? I was just a little concerned. A sick person wouldn't go on a diet. Yes. I guess you're right. He hid the medical test results in his room. Mom found them while cleaning. When I was going through Dad's belongings, I found a book with its cover reversed. As I expected, it was porn. It was porn. This is... a strategy guide. Mayday is a DPS, Kirin is a Healer, Aru is a Tank. DPS: Positioning is important! Healer: Restores allies' HP! Tank: Attracts enemy attacks! Dad. So this is the enemy's home base. Yes, we've almost reached the climax of the story. I'm looking forward to this. Okay. Let's go. He is the same as usual. Like I thought, he was just kidding. By the way, I have a class reunion, so I'll be home late. Get dinner for yourself. Oh, all right. What about Dad? He said he will order a take-out food. I see. Okay, see you later. See you. -Here we go. There! -There! What? New York? Yes. I'll be leaving next week. This year, I'm on my way to be promoted to foreign sales. Actually, this is quite incredible. When Kosaku Shima was my age, he worked in New York too. -Sorry! -Sorry! Also, at that time, Kosaku wasn't getting along with his wife, so he got himself a hot girlfriend in America named Eileen. I'm not getting along with my wife either. Sounds like things could go well for me. You're a positive thinker, Mr. Hakamada. "Pessimism comes from the temperament, optimism from the will." Alain, a French philosopher, once said that. -Sorry! -Sorry! Which brings me to my point. There are some clients I would like you to take over for me. For the next week, please come along to my meetings with the clients. All right. Okay! I'm counting on you. I have opened the way for you. All you have to do is follow in my footsteps. -Sorry! -Sorry! Okay! Lunch break is over! -Sorry! -Sorry! All right. I'll figure something out. Hey! Inaba! -Yes? -Come here. Sorry, but can you stay at the office until late tonight? Well, sure... They made a mistake. So, the new products won't be delivered until late tonight. We want them delivered to all our clients tomorrow morning. So, we have to accept delivery tonight. You can take a half-day off tomorrow. All right. I'll do it. -Thank you. I'm counting on you. -Yes, sir. -Hey, Inaba. Let's go. -Yes, sir. I'll be back after I meet this client. Okay, I'm counting on you. -Come on. Let's go. -Sorry. I'm coming. Hello? Yes, we are good. Really? New York? Hakamada, get yourself a sexy blond woman while you're there. When I do, I'll text you, "Mission accomplished." I'm looking forward to that. So, you'll be the new sales rep? Yes. Pleasure to meet you. I'm Inaba. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Masui. -Let's be friends. -Okay. The explanation of the scanner that I promised will be taken care of by Inaba. I will now go say goodbye to the other departments as well. Okay. Do your best. You see, Akio, I'm completely hopeless with high tech devices. Explain it in a simple way so that even a monkey can understand. -Okay. -Really? Good, let's go. Is that so? Hey, Akio, do you know a lot about soccer? Well, a little. Seriously? I'm playing futsal next week. Play with us. -What? Well, I'm not sure I can play. -Come on, join me. Come on! Play with me! -Well, I'm not sure. -Try it! What? Oh, it's Akio! Mr. Oono. Akio... I mean, Mr. Inaba, do you know the president? What? You mean this company... Yes, this is my company. Akio, I heard about your father's health. I know it must be difficult. Pardon? What? He hasn't told you about his illness? Illness? You mean he is... Dad! MR. KURIYAMA Hello? Inaba, it's time to get back here. Yes, sir. Why isn't he answering? Maidy still hasn't shown up. Why don't we join the Gorgimera subjugation event that is happening nearby? Sorry! I didn't mean to keep you all waiting! Oh, Mayday! Dad. You were so late that I fell asleep. Okay, let's go! Let's crush the empire! What the heck have I been doing? This is not a time to be playing games. There must... There must have been something else that we should have been doing together. Dad. Dad! Please fight with me one more time! There is no such thing as game over in real life as long as you don't give up. I would rather go with the others. I'll give up on it today. He's a no-good, useless son. Whenever I come here, it is always so beautiful. Please fight with me one more time! I'm suffering from an illness. Dad! Wow! Today was a lot of fun. Okay, see you tomorrow. Wait! M. Maidy: You said you quit your job because you are sick. M. Maidy: Are you fine now? "To be honest, I don't think I'm fine. The doctor recommended me to get surgery." Did you undergo surgery? I. Jones: No, I didn't. Why not? M. Maidy: Why didn't you have the surgery? My job used to mean everything to me. Due to my illness, I had to quit my job. I feel like I lost everything. I didn't know what to live for. I felt getting surgery was pointless. I felt like I was lost in the darkness. But things are different now. After meeting all of you and going on adventures together for the past few months, I realized that there is still a lot of things to enjoy in this world. I'm really grateful for what you've done for me. I finally feel like I have the courage to fight my illness. I'm truly... truly grateful to all of you. Akio. I'm about to say something that might shock you. Your father is suffering from an illness. Until now, Dad has defeated tons of powerful enemies. He will defeat this disease too. I know he will.
