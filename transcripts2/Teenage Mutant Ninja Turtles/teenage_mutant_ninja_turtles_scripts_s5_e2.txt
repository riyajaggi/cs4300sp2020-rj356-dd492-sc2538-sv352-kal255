 to raise your precious Shredder yet. Two things remain; his heart, through which new life can flow, and his lost helmet, the Kuro Kabuto, which holds his mental energy.

I found this at Ray's Occult Book Shop. It's got some weird stuff on Demodragons. Which is great, because my Internet sources are spotty at best. Well, we need to be ready soon. Raph! Chompy's distracting me from my game! [grunting] [grunting] That's it... Meeting in the dojo. One minute, Leo. Not one minute. Remember what Splinter said about being diligent? Yeah. A rolling stone with moss on it... [grunts] Needs to play video games? Tiger Claw's out there with a dragon, and all you can think of is "Super Commando 3"? Chillax, Leo. Hot Head isn't going anywhere. Well, then you have time to clean up all your comics and empty pizza boxes. In fact, clean up now, or no TV for a week. A week? Raph, back me up, bro. Better listen to him, Mikey. Leo is the sensei now! Guys, the motion sensors picked up a couple of mutants. They look to be heading toward Shredder's old lair. Better check it out. Raph, Mikey, since you two have nothing better to do, go track the signal. Why do I have to be on patrol duty? Just do it, Raph! Hey, why don't you get off my... [grunts] [creaking, thud] Whoa, Sensei Leo is kind of strict. [groaning] Fine. Ugh. Patrol it is. C'mon, Mikey. Remember, stealth and recon only. [exciting music] [grunts] "The Forgotten Swordsman" I should never have been down that long. I'm not gonna have some upstart mercenary undo my work rebuilding the Foot. I'm sorry, Karai. I should have kept those traitors in line. They need a strong leader. They're waiting to see how this plays out. There! [car starts, tires squeal] "The Forgotten Swordsman" I don't know, Raph. Leo seemed really mad. [both grunt] I know. He just misses Master Splinter. Being sensei's hard on him. I just wish we knew... [device beeping] [dramatic music] Check it! What's Fishface doing at Shredder's old lair? Whoa, Rahzar. I thought he was... Quiet down! Let's find out what they're after. Mm. Nothing. No sign of the Kabuto. I cannot believe we've been demoted to errand boys. I knew I should have taken my vacation time. The Caribbean is warm this time of year. As are the ladies... [smooches] You never did understand the honor of the Foot Clan. The Kuro Kabuto's no mere helmet. It's much more powerful than you realize. Ay, si, si. I get it. Look, I'm just saying, a lot has changed. You look good, though. Did you, erm, put on weight? No, but I developed a taste for sushi. [chomps] ♪♪ [grunts] They're after Shredder's helmet for some reason. We gotta find out why. ♪♪ [brakes screech] No guards? Be extra careful. So this is where you traitors are hiding! We serve the Foot Clan. You are not worthy to be its master. [grunts] [chuckles] [Shini crows] [grunting] [crashing] [grunts] [grunting] Pathetic. [grunts] What? Heh. Think you can play tricks with me? Who is this Akuma? [light whooshing] Something familiar about... No! Shinigami! Only one man can fight that well. [light mysterious music] ♪♪ Hisashiburidana, my old pupil. [sniffing] [growls] Dude, where did they go? - Dah! - [grunts] Dah! Get off of me, zombie wolf! I'm gonna enjoy feasting on your shell, Michelangelo! [grunting] [growls] We're onto you looking for Shredder's helmet. - [grunts] - What does Hot Head want with it anyway? A little small for him. [grunts] [blow lands] [grunts] [growls] Ah, that is the best part, Tartaruga! Our new friend is going to help Shredder just like he did Wolfman... [growls] I-I mean, Bradford here. With the Kuro Kabuto, the Shredder will walk the Earth again! [both gasp] That's messed up! You want to raise Shredder? Well, you won't be around to see it. [grunting] Argh! [sighs] I hate when they do that. [growls] Come on. We have to find the Kabuto anyway. [both sniffing] [growls] Hattori Tatsu! You stole my Foot Soldiers. [grunts] [both grunting, metal clanging] ♪♪ ♪♪ [grunts] [screeches] [screeching] It's true! You have become one of them... A freak! Bakemono ga! [grunts] [screeches] [grunts] [screeches] [hisses] [panting] You should not have come out of hiding. Ah! [exclaims] Ahh! They're gone, Master Hattori. [grunts] Useless fools! You have all gotten soft. We focus on the Kabuto for now, but do not fail me again. [both panting] If Tatsu has the Kabuto, we need it back. That's the key to controlling the Foot Clan. He is a cunning one, Karai. We will need help to defeat him. You're right. We better go visit some old friends. I'm telling you, we go in all pucks blazing. And I'm telling you, Hot Head is too powerful for that! All right, enough! We wait till Raph and Mikey get back for our next move. You always did like bossing people around. Karai! I wish I could say this was a social visit. Someone new is trying to take over the Foot Clan. He's after the Kuro Kabuto. So what? Let the bad guys squabble over Shredder's stupid hat. We might not have a choice. Guess who else is going after that Kabuto? And you're not gonna believe why. - What? - Whoa... They're going to use the Kabuto to bring Shredder back from the dead? Is that possible? Totally possible! Didn't you see "Evil Ninja 4: Ninja Resurrection"? Well, we are dealing with a dragon spirit from the underworld. Do you think Tatsu is working with Tiger Claw? Doubtful. Tatsu seems to think he's the new Shredder. But if we keep him from getting the Kabuto, the Foot will side with its deserved leader. After all Shredder put you through, why not just give up on the Foot? It's not that simple, O'Neil. Tatsu will be coming after all of us. We have no choice but to take him down. [sniffs] Wait. I smell someone... familiar. [both grunt] [roars] [grunts] [tense music] [startles] Hattori Tatsu? I thought you never left Japan. Chris Bradford. The Kuro Kabuto is in my possession. You have it? The Kuro Kabuto is worthy only of Shredder! And your loyalty is the only reason I shall spare you. I intend to carry on Shredder's legacy, make the Foot great once more. You could have a place at my side. [pained yelp] You swore an oath to the Foot, Bradford. Consider my offer. It will not last long. [grunts] [car starts, tires squeal] I'm gonna get that tolo! Hmm, I don't know, Xever. Maybe Tatsu's deal is worth considering. [motor humming, brakes screech] You guys need a less conspicuous ride. You sure this is it? There are only a few Foot safe houses where he can be. Okay, if Tatsu has the Kabuto, we get in and grab it quickly. Mikey, you're with me, Karai, and Shini. Aw, yeah, Team Shini-angelo! This girl gets me, don't you? You do make me laugh. Go after the Kabuto. I'll take care of Tatsu. No, stealth only. The rest of you hang here on lookout. Rahzar and Fishface are still out there. [mysterious music] ♪♪ At last, the Kuro Kabuto. Now I claim my rightful place as true leader of the Foot Clan. [grunting] ♪♪ ♪♪ [grunting] ♪ ♪♪ [both grunt] [creaking] [grunts] ♪♪ [laughter] Hey! [laughing] [gasps] Guys, we have company. [device chimes] [gasps] [beeping] [all grunting] [exclaims] [hollow clanging] [chuckles] Foolish gambit! Tatsu is... blind? Don't you know I can hear you coming a mile away? [grunting, swords clashing] You couldn't defeat me yourself, so you employed your freaks to fight me, yes? What's he talking about, Karai? Did my old student not tell you the story of poor Hattori Tatsu? Yah! [exclaims] [both grunt] [shuriken whirring] I was born blind, but with an acute sense of hearing. They say it gave me a sixth sense. [grunting, swords clashing] Plan Blackout was definitely not the way to go, dudes. Shredder recognized this as a skill when all others mocked me. I used that prejudice in my favor until I became Shredder's right hand. [grunting] The Blind Swordsman. [grunts] When this brat recruited Foot soldiers of her own, they attempted to eliminate me. You did what? Tatsu, I was arrogant, but they have nothing to do with that. Do not insult me with your platitudes, girl! Your friends will share your fate. [grunting, blows landing] [panting] [exciting music] [banging] [grunting] - Ah! - Hey! I just washed this baby. Ah! We don't have time for this. [exclaims] [all grunting] I expected more from the students of the great Splinter. [grunting] [grunting, swords clashing] [both gasp] [grunts] - Ah! - Ah! [grunts] [water splashes] ♪♪ Shini, no! [hisses] [both grunting] [hisses] Korede owarida! [explosions] Ah! [grunts] [high-pitched ringing] [groaning] Aw, yeah! The cavalry has arrived. [exciting music] [both exclaim] - Goongala! - Watch it, Jones. [electricity crackling] [grunts] [crackling] - [grunts] - [groaning] [grunts] - Casey! - Yah! [both grunting] Ah-ah! Huh. [both grunting] [panting] It's like fighting Shredder. But he's still blind. ♪♪ ♪♪ [explosions] Yah! [grunting] Ah! [groaning] Ahh! [startling] [hissing] Ah! - [screeches] - Ah! [hissing] [grunting] [screeches] [hisses] [gasps] [hisses] [tense music] [screeches] [panting] Tatsu was using you, just like the Shredder, tarnishing the name of the Foot Clan for his own glory. The Foot deserves a noble destiny... One with honor. You truly think you deserve to wield the Kuro Kabuto? Deserve's got nothing to do with it. Go back to Japan and rot. [grunting] Tatsu! Bradford, join me! The Kuro Kabuto is worthy only of... The Shredder! [intense choral music] ♪♪ [gasps] ♪♪ [grunting] Ahh! [thud] ♪♪ ♪♪ No! The Kabuto! The power to resurrect Shredder is ours! Destroy the Turtles. Leave no one alive! As you command. [growls] ♪♪ [coughing] Thanks, April. I thought we were toast. We gotta get them to a hospital. Casey Jones isn't out of it yet. [moans] [eerie tones] [dramatic music] ♪♪ ♪♪ [low growl] ♪♪ ♪♪ Now only his heart remains. My men are on it. Remember who your master is, Kavaxas. Indeed. [sirens wailing distantly] [somber music] ♪♪ Shini and Casey will be all right. They just need to rest. Guys, I'm so sorry. I was ashamed by what I did, going after Tatsu. I didn't think it would come back to hurt us. Splinter once taught me, "Underestimating your enemy is a deadly weakness, but trusting in your allies is a great strength." We're gonna need your help against Hot Head. Whoa. I can't think of anything more frightening than Shredder coming back to life. We can't let that happen! We have to stop Tiger Claw and Kavaxas once and for all! Synchronized by srjanapala [rousing hip-hop music] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪
