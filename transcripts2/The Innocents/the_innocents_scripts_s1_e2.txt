 Harry! Stop, please! Stop! Where's June? What have you done to her? It's me! It's me. I'm June. Oh, this is crazy. This is crazy. This is... This is crazy! - I don't understand it, either! - This is crazy. But it's me. - You saw me in the mirror, didn't you? - No. It's not possible. It's not possible.

 You saw me! Harry? Wait! You told me... that you kept all my letters... and that you weren't embarrassed. Harry, I don't know how... ... but it's me. It's really me. Steinar! Is that plum jam? Yes. In English, please, Elena. I haven't spoken in my own tongue for almost three years. The rules are there for a reason, Sigrid.

 Runa likes to keep a firm hand on the reins, as you know. We're very lucky to have you with us, aren't we? Will you take me, too? Lewis, go back downstairs. I'll be right there, okay? Harry? Harry, I needed you here this morning. I can't be everywhere at once. I'm pissed off! June? June! June? Has anyone seen June? June McDaniel? Mr. McDaniel? John! Police, please. Doug, sorry. I'm gonna be in late. - Well, good morning to you, too. - What's happened? Harry's gone AWOL. I'm waiting for the carer. Okay. Well, on your way in, can you drop by the McDaniel farm? I'll get uniform to pick you up. Just had a call from the head at the school saying John was there wreaking merry hell. Something about a crowbar. - Crowbar? - Yeah, nothing like that. No one got hurt. He was looking for his daughter. School said he's moving the family away. Clearly, the girl was not happy about it. Run away, most likely. Sure, I'll swing by. Aaron, you're a lifesaver. - How are you doing? You all right? - I gotta go. Okay, okay. Tell me again. I went back. I checked his body. I... Oh... He grabbed me, and then I don't know what happened. But he was... still on the ground, but I was also him. Okay. Was he dead? - After? - No, he was breathing. - His eyes were vibrating. - No, no. But how can you only be in there? It's not possible! Do you feel like him? I feel like me. What's... What's happening to me? What if... What if I'm like this forever? No, please, don't! I don't want you near me like this. Don't. Oh, my God, I'm so hungry. - I have to eat. - What? I said, I'm hungry. Okay. I'm gonna go get you some food. Harry, wait. Don't bring anyone here. Don't tell anyone, please. Okay. Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm... come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. Housekeeping! Oh! Sorry. - Shall I come back later? - Yes, please. What? Yes, please. Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. I saw the maid. What happened? Is everything okay? Um, they only had cheese and onion. Sorry. So good. Harry... look at me. Please. I'm right here. You know what you need? What? Ah! Harry! Feel good? Ah. Hospital? Hospital? Hospital? Why did you check on him? You were so scared, I... I had to make sure he was okay. Otherwise, it was over. - You'd leave. - I'm not going anywhere. Tell me it's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. I love you, June. - June? - Harry. It's me. Harry! Harry, it's me! June! June! It's okay. It's okay, I'm here. It's okay. Steinar? - Steinar? - It's you. It's really you. I've got you. It's okay. Steinar. Where are your clothes? We have to go back. I'll drive. - We need to get you to a hospital. - No! No! No hospitals. The girl... I have to find her. Okay. But I'll drive. Okay? Well, I like the look of Scotland. Where's June? If you know, you have to tell me. Listen to me. - You know June has a condition. - What? Her epilepsy? No. It's... It's hard to explain, but it's something Elena had, too. You don't talk about Mum. You don't get to say her name. June. It's the police. Can almost hear the dueling banjos from here. I reckon he had pigs on the farm. John. It's been a while. I hear June's missing. Let's go inside. We got a call from the school. Luckily, they're not pressing charges. Come on, John. You can't go rampaging around a school with a crowbar, can you? - No. - Right. What did she take? Enough for a weekend? - A week? - Just some... clothes, a bag. She's not planning on going very far for very long, then. - When did you see her last? - Last night. - Did you argue or fight? - No. You're moving the family away? Yes, but we talked about it. She was looking forward to it. Kids can be pretty secretive at that age. They run off when they're angry. They do stupid, selfish things without thinking, like my son. Well... Okay, then. If you haven't heard from her by tomorrow morning, call us. Although I'm sure she's fine. Christ, he's weird. - Do you have kids? - No. Give him a break, then. - Were you... in his body? - No. No, I told you. There were... two of us. I was him. When it happened, though... my clothes... ripped and... ... I just took his and I left. What's happening to me? Hey. Come here. You need to talk to me, Ryan. Ryan! I'm ready to talk when you are! Right. Here we are again. You understand, Elena, that we need to identify the emotions that caused your first shift to get to the heart of the experience which defines your ongoing trigger. Your instincts will tell you to resist... to repress, even. But I don't want you to. Let the emotions come... and let me in. If, however, you feel like you're losing control, if you feel like you're hitting shift state, just remember your mantra, and remember who you are. Can you tell me? Elena Askelaand. Thirty-nine. Born south of Bergen. Pierced ears with Girl Guide badge. Broken arm. Father, Thor, carried me home. Painted cars with watercolors. Pet elkhound, Heidi. Broken shoes under storm clouds, staring at Gracie. Very good. Ready to begin? Yes. I'll be with you every step of the way. Respond. Clear. Respond. Clear. Respond. Clear. Clear. Clear. Respond. Respond. Clear. Respond. Clear. Elena, what do you see? Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. Remember your mantra. Remember your mantra, Elena. Elena, remember your mantra. All right. Stay with us. Elena... Tell me what you see, please. - What do you see? - Stop the test! Tell me what you see! Elena! Elena! Tell me what you see! Let me go. Let me go. Let... Let me go. Let me go... Let me... Let me go! Help me! Let me go! Okay, John Boy. No, no! You know, if you want to go home, then... I understand. Let's just get out of here. Steinar? Yeah. What happened? You said the plan had changed. Do you have June? Did you show her Elena's message? Not yet. Last night, she ran away with a boy. I'm following her. - Is this gonna be a problem? - No. And... Ben. You were right. She is one of them. She's a shifter. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Don't worry. I have everything under control. Okay, what the hell happened last night? Hmm? You asked me to help you find a girl... and from the money you offered, I knew it wasn't legit. But you didn't say anything about needles. You said nothing about... kids with weapons, or you getting naked, or... fucking... vibrating eyes! - I lost control. - You lost control? Lost control. I thought it was my last chance to get to her. You know what? When I found you, it looked like you had murdered her. Or worse. Ripped-up clothes, blood... Jesus, man. You're like a bloodhound, back on her trail. What the fuck... What are you up to? Listen. This girl is special. Special how? Special in what way? I have to... take her back with me. Damn... Okay, well... Where to now? I guess she's scared, so... she'll go home. Check upstairs. She's not here. June McDaniel. How can one little girl cause so much trouble? Let's go. So what we gonna do? We both ran away... to stop being trapped. To be who we wanted to be. So, okay, I know we didn't know that... was coming. But we still believe in each other. Right? Yeah. Do you think we can still get away from it all? Yeah. Yeah, I do. So let's go. Yeah, let's go. I told you she wouldn't be here. Okay... smart-ass. Where is she? How the hell should I know? You're the one... What about this guy? Yeah? June McDaniel. Harry Polk. Where are they? Don't know what you're on about. Now piss off. Kids. All piss and vinegar. What did you say? - Listen, we're not... - Listen, I said piss off! So I was thinking... the guy who did that... thing to you... whatever it is... maybe it was an alien. He knew my name. He said he'd been... trying to get to me for weeks. He knew my mum. She'd... sent him. What about his clothes? There's got to be something in here. Says... "Norge" on them. Norway. Isn't that where your mum's from? Yeah. Harry, look. - That's Mum. - June... my girl. You're about to turn 16. I want to be there to help you understand things you might be feeling. Things that... might be happening to you. I never wanted to leave you. You or Ryan. But John said I had to go. I... I didn't have a choice. The last thing I ever wanted to do was to hurt either of you. I'm sorry I can't be there myself. So I need you to trust the man who shows you this video and let... let him bring you here to Norway. It's a wonderful place, June. And one day, Ryan can come here, too, and... we can all be together again. Just... I'm sorry. I love you. June. She said she loves me. Of course she loves you. She's your mum. No, Dad told us that... she left because she couldn't... handle us. That she didn't want us. That she... ... she wanted a different life. It's okay. It's okay. June McDaniel. Harry Polk. - John? - Your son Harry. Where is he? I wish I knew. Why? Because he's with June. Wherever they are, they're together. What? Are you sure? Read it. They think they're in love. Have you tried calling him? He's not picking up. June? She left her phone at home. Look, she's different. Shy, quiet. She doesn't know any boys. - She'd never do anything like this. - It wouldn't be Harry's idea. He has too many responsibilities. Helping with his dad, for one. We know they're together. So they probably planned it. Look, I have to ask. Is there anything else I should know? No. I'm just worried about her. Listen. Kids run away. But they come back. Not as quickly as you'd like, but they come back. But if we haven't heard from them by tomorrow morning, I'll report it. I can get a search put out. Okay? Sorry. Yeah? All right. I'll be right there. Thanks. That was work. I have to go. If you hear from June, call me. Give me your number, and I'll do the same. - What happened? - Ah, he's saying a guy broke in and robbed him. His neighbor's saying she saw two men. - What's his name? - Dean Coppley. Who's this? This is Ella. She's got your eyes. Dean, I'm Detective Inspector Polk. Do you want to tell me what happened? Just some bloke, all right? Broke in. That's it. - Your neighbor's saying she saw two men. - There was one. - Just one guy. - Okay. What'd he take? How should I know? All sorts. Uh, me watch. Took me watch. That's nice. He didn't take it. Can I have a look? What? My ring? It's all right. Where'd you get this? Did a boy give you this? Was his name Harry? Harry Polk? Dean? I know you're scared, but you need to tell me what happened. - What's it like being back in London? - I don't remember it like this. Okay. We're here. That's it. It will be fine. Yeah. Who the fuck are you? Just kidding, brother. I know who you are. Gavin told us about you. Dean's bro? - Yeah, yeah. - Come on. I appreciate you letting us stay, mate. Sorry for any trouble. So, um... which room is ours? Everyone just... sleeps wherever they want. Sometimes with whoever they want. Mi casa es tu casa. There's a killer view on the roof, brother. Uh, yeah. Thanks. Where have you been? You went outside. - When? How? - I saw you taking off earlier. I came into the house, and then, these two guys turned up. One of them said June's name. What? She was supposed to call me. - She still hasn't. - Tell me where she is! If I tell you, I'm coming with you. If June's in trouble, she needs me. Let's go, then. You should answer that. We need to tell her about those two guys that broke in. June could be in trouble. We... - Have you heard something? - No. Just thought you'd like some company. I brought beer. Come in. How are you, mate? You look good. So you still battling over your silly bloody crosswords? Cheers. Still no word from Harry, then? - I know you're worried. - He stole his dad's wedding ring and bought a car from a guy who was beaten up by two men. I've no idea where my boy is. Yeah, Doug, I'm worried. What? I know what you get like. I saw how bad it got for you back then, remember? Was it really three years ago? I miss him. Me, too. Do you still think about the case? About what happened? Try not to. We did everything we could. I can't imagine us as partners anymore. Especially now with you climbing the ranks. Yeah, right. I was trying to keep up with you back then. I'm a DI who can't even look after her own son. - I have to report him missing. - Harry is a good lad. He loves you. He'll come home. Yeah. - Different to how I imagined it. - Yup. Everyone says that. You can't argue with that view, though. I mean, I know people say it's big and scary, but... it's not that bad. Yeah. Don't worry, I'll look after you. Yeah? Hey. No one will come after us here. And now we can start again. Just like we promised each other. Now we can... be whoever we want to be. B-6. A less trusting woman might become jealous, wondering about what you get up to in here. Jealousy, really? My love. Please... I've seen conflicting early slide sets, but Elena's feel... polarized. Mother, child... sex, death. In the beginning, those tests scared me like you wouldn't believe. It was strange to think that hitting shift state was part of the treatment. But you keep going, Ben. She needs to re-center. That's why she's here. Don't forget that. I have some rather exciting news. June... is just like her mother. She's one of us. You're always one step ahead, aren't you? - Always. - That's wonderful. Wonderful news. Mother and daughter. It's such a... such a rare thing. And one day, Ryan can come here, too, and we can all be together again. Just... I'm sorry. I love you. - You know this epilepsy you have? - Yeah. What else did your dad tell you? Just that Mum had it, too. Did you ever see your mum have a fit? No. No, Dad just said she was... sick. Why are you asking? I don't know. Is there any way your dad can know about... any of this? How could he? Okay, look. Just... just think about it. The sedatives. All these crazy rules. Never letting you out of his sight. June, he was going to take you to bloody Fair Isle. And I looked at pictures of it. There's nothing there. It's in the middle of nowhere. And now there's two nutters from Norway who turn up with a video of your mum, and says that John told her to leave and she wants you to join her. - It doesn't make any sense! - Harry. - Look, I'm sorry, June. - No, Harry. Look. Oh, God. That's him. - We have to go. Now! - Yeah. Come on! It must be back... back there. Turn around. Oh, Harry! The bags! Forget the bags. I'll do the talking. No need for you to go all Chuck Norris again. Okay? Keys! Come on! Mum told me I can trust them. I don't understand! Hey, it's okay, yeah? Just don't think about that now. Yeah. - Yeah. - Shit! - Harry! - It's gonna be okay. Shit, shit, shit! We lost them. We lost them. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop! Stop the van! What the hell? Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you, man? Are you okay? Are you hurt? - We have to go. - Yeah. It's nothing. I'm fine. This is notfine!
