 June! I'm sorry I have to do this, Harry, but I need to talk to you about June. Could you imagine what it must be like to be able to see someone else's memories, feel their emotions, have that deep a level of understanding about someone? Who they are, what they've experienced. Who they've loved. I mean... You could almost live somebody else's life. In order for me to help June gain control,

 I need to understand her root trauma. My guess is it's fear that causes her to shift. Now, I know that Steinar mishandled the situation, but he... he was her first shift, wasn't he? Oh, yeah. You mean, the guy you sent to kidnap her? Yeah. He mishandled it. Can you tell me about that night? I'll need you to help me. We wouldn't want a repeat of yesterday, would we? Let me out! Let me out of here! Let me out! Mm. My love...

 What is it? What's the matter? I didn't sleep so well. I had a terrible dream. What about? That... Freya was still here. - Morning. - Morning. I'll make you a tea. Where's Harry? Ah... I'm sorry to say that Harry decided to leave. He, uh... He came to see me last night. We had a really good chat. He really felt that he... that he couldn't help you anymore. - He said that? - I explained my work, what we do here, and how I'll be able to help you. And he... he agreed - this really is the best place for you. - That's not what he told me. He... He felt that he's losing you more after each shift. - And after yesterday with your mother... - That was an accident. It was you not being able to control your gift. It is not a gift. June, listen, you're very special. I don't want to be special! Stop it! Don't fight, please. Don't worry about Harry. I took him across the lake myself. I drove him to Holen Fjord, I gave him money. I'm sure he's safely at home by now. I can help you, June, I promise you. What's important is that you now concentrate on yourself and the work that we're gonna do for you. June... Have I done the right thing? Coming here. Yes. We'll look after you now. I can't believe Harry left. Sanctum isn't for everyone. Elena? June would like to talk to you. Now, obviously, we can't have a repeat of yesterday. So, I would ask that you both stay on opposite sides of the room. Okay? I'm gonna wait outside, and we should leave the door open. How did you do that yesterday? - Get in my head like that? - I don't know. It just happens. I'm sorry you saw those things. That's why I left. To protect you from them. But this is a good place, June. - The right place for you. - I hope so. - I need to fix myself. - No, you're not broken. Aren't I? Aren't we all here because there's something wrong with us? Something that we need help with? I'm gonna work hard and I'm gonna get well. But I'm gonna do it for me, not you. And afterwards, I'm gonna find Harry. Freya? I can't do this anymore. I'm so scared, I feel sick. We're committed to the therapy. Ben is trying to help us. He forces me to stay in Steinar, with his memories. I don't want to see those things anymore. Memories. That's nonsense. Shifters can't see people's memories. - Why are you lying? - I'm telling the truth. Mama, I'm leaving. Come with me, please. Sanctum... is our home now. Our first truly safe home we have ever known. Freya? Freya. I can't come with you. I won't. And if you go... ... you'll never see me again. Freya? Freya? They're not used to having strangers here, especially men. Except you. You're hidden out here in the middle of nowhere. Just you and these women. They all wear those same dresses, live by your rules. I take it you don't trust me. I think you're some David Koresh wannabe, and this is your Waco. Sigrid was one of the first to join us. She was a very different woman when she arrived. It's taken a long time and a lot of very difficult work, but she's now re-centered. - Re-centered? - She no longer shifts. Through a very particular path of psychological understanding, she now has total control of her emotional trigger. Now, she's no different to you or me. The reason we're in the middle of nowhere is to avoid anybody who doesn't understand them. Surely you can appreciate that. You were wanting to take June away to a Scottish island. Is that right? You can't help her, John. I think we both know that. Maybe. - But if she's staying, I'm staying, too. - Of course. No... We're not allowed to touch here. It's... the rules. - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine. I'm here to take you home. I know what happened the night Mum left. It's why you wanted to take me away, isn't it? You wanted to protect me. - Protect other people from me. - No. Trying to control every part of your life was wrong of me. I should have talked to you, tried to prepare you. - I was scared. - Yeah, you were right to be. You haven't seen the things I've done, the things I'm capable of. I have to take responsibility for what I am. I'm not like normal people. Dad, I have to stay here, at Sanctum, with these women. They're like me, and maybe they can help me. But Harry told me about that girl you met, Kam. - She said this place was dangerous. - Yeah, but she was dangerous. - She betrayed us. - And Harry, is he staying, too? Harry's gone. - He left last night. - What? Ben helped him. You know, made sure he was okay. No. No way. No, he wouldn't just leave. He must have forced him. No, Dad. You don't understand. I don't blame him. I mean, he knows what Mum did to... to his family, to his dad. He knows what I am, better than anyone. How could he ever look at me the same way again? That lad loves you. Really loves you. Don't ever forget that. You shouldn't be in here. She said you told her everything. That night... Those people... Is it true that they never woke up? The old woman did. The last one you shifted into. But not the others. - They're all catatonic. - And Lewis? - You know Harry's his son? - You shouldn't have brought him. He'd have come anyway, with or without me. He loves her. Didn't you used to say love was the most important thing? - The thing you miss the most. - John, I... Don't. I'm only here for June. She needs to be home with her family. No. She needs me. She needs someone who can understand her in a way that neither of you ever will. - Hi. - Hi. This is where we got the hit on his phone. We checked CCTV at the bus depot. Nothing. Checked the car rental shops, again. No Harry Polk. John McDaniel. Is it possible to get tracking information on his hire car? I'll make the call. We'll find him. We will find Harry. Runa? She's back. - Ben, I... I saw her. - Who? Freya. Listen, have you been in the barn today? No, but I saw Steinar leaving there earlier. I... I thought he would be trying to help Freya again. Why don't you have a lie-down? - Yes. Yeah. - A rest. I would like to make a toast. To June, the most recent addition to our Sanctum family. This will be a long and challenging road, but I can promise you, if you work together with all of us, you will learn to control your gift and not have it control you. You being here at Sanctum can only make it a better place. Skol. - Skol. - Skol. Ah, Runa's not feeling so well, so she's not gonna join us, I'm afraid. Do you always eat like this? - Like a family? - Family's important to us. We take it in turns to cook for each other. Share recipes and such. I wasn't that good a cook when I arrived, but, uh, Runa taught me. You were a fast learner at everything here. Was it hard? The therapy. Yes, but the pain was worth it. You have to trust Dr. Halvorson, June. Sigrid, isn't it? The doctor tells me you're cured. We don't call it that, but yes. - So why haven't you left? - The women at Sanctum are unique. It's not that simple. You said she's just like me and you now. She doesn't need to be here anymore, right? - It's not a prison, is it? - Dad. I just want to know what you're getting yourself into. What about you, Elena? Are you cured? No, but it takes time. - And what about Runa? - Yes, she is re-centered. But she chooses to stay to help me and any other women who may arrive here. Two people cured, but neither leaves. That doesn't sound like a place that helps people. It's a place for us. For June. - She's my daughter, too. - And it's her decision to stay. You're so full of suspicion, John. Is that why you broke into my office? The place where I try to help these women. The only place where they feel safe enough to talk about their trauma, their pain, without judgment or fear. I'm curious, actually, what you found that's prompted these questions. I think it's time for you to leave. Yeah? He's right, John. You don't belong here. You shouldn't have gone in there. It was wrong. You're not one of us. June, listen to me. This place, it's... it's not right. Harry knew it. And there's no way he would've left without seeing you. No chance. John. I'm... I'm sorry, but I never asked you to come here. You or Harry. As painful as it was, Harry at least understood that this place is not for him. It's not for you, either. You can stay tonight, but I'll drive you to the nearest town in the morning. All right? She told me, you know? About who you were. - What's that? - Before you came here. I must've left some equipment on in the office. - I'll sort that out. Keep eating. - No one took you seriously. They all laughed at you. - You are just a pathetic failure... - Freya? - Freya! - Runa! - ... who wishes he was special. - Who is that? - Runa, Runa. Please, come back inside. - No, no! Don't touch me! Please, come back inside. - What are you? - Freya? You're just ordinary. Runa, please! Please! - Freya! Freya? Freya? - And you hate yourself for it. And that she saved you. What? Steinar? What are you doing here? I'm back. No! Surprised? What are you doing? Put the gun down, please. - That's Kam. - No, her real name was Freya. I need you all to see this. I'm so excited... English, please, Freya. - Why are you... taping this? - What are you doing? Well, what your mother can do is incredible. And if you're the same as her, I want to capture it, capture this moment for all of us. What if I'm not like her? Well, let's not think about that right now. I've been working with your mother for a little while, and I believe that her ability is tied to how she processes emotional pain. - Do you understand? - She told me not to be scared. That's correct. Are you ready? Good. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - It's not what you think. It's okay, Freya. If you can hear me, I need you to touch Steinar. Shit! Shit! Shit! Freya? Can you hear me? Freya, will you look at me? Can you say something? I'm going to need a man like you. A good man. A partner who can keep a secret. What did you just say? It's what you... what you told Steinar. After you first met my mother. Listen. This is not what you think it is. It was just the beginning. I was just forming the therapy. Therapy? You were electrocuting her. Runa, did you know? Oh, she knew. She knew. Incredible, Freya. You're different to your mother. I don't know how you get inside Steinar's mind. I just... I just can. But I don't like what's in there. Can we please stop? Not right now. We need to understand more about what you can do. But I'm so tired. I want Mama. Runa... Runa Gundersen, 56, born in Levanger, steps to green door... White-haired baby... - Double-jointed... - My love... Social worker. Runa Gundersen... - Are you going to shift? - No. And when I get out of here, Mama and me are leaving! She loves me! And I saved her. Runa will never leave. - Will you turn that off? - Shut up! Why did you do this? I had to help you. I couldn't let him do the same thing to you. This is what you are. This is what you do. See, he tells you... you will find yourself... ... but you will lose everything. This place is poison. All you need to do is submit. You're being selfish. I don't understand. You worked for him. - You came after me. - No, June... Stay back! Get over there! June. You come with me. And Runa, please. You said we were a family. You promised to protect us. - You stay away from me. - You're a monster. You lied to us. - You betrayed us! - You're judging me? Sigrid Vollen. The little... broken bird with all your secrets and pain. You've done worse than me, and more! All of you have! Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. ... come to no harm. - June. June, come with me, please. - Keep calm, come to no harm. - Keep calm, come to no harm. - Ben. Why are you doing this? Because I said I would do everything for you. - Anything. June! - Please just don't hurt anyone else. - June, no! - June! No! - I... I don't understand. - I'm gonna save you, my darling. I am gonna save you. You stay back! Keep calm, come to no harm. - Keep calm, come to no harm. - Ben? - Ben. Talk to me, please. - Get inside. Inside. Oh! You lied to me! You told me he'd left! June, are you okay? Hey! What's happening? Hey! - Now, June. You listen to me. - What are you doing? Why is this girl so important? Tell me. It's you that's important. You're all I care about. - You're all I've ever cared about. - I don't understand. It's your illness. You're getting worse, my love. You know you are. But she's the answer. You've seen it. And June can find the things that you don't remember. She can find the things that make you who you are. We can use her to save you. You want June to... shift into me? Oh, come on, my love. After everything we've been through, yes. Yes, don't you understand? Your memories will replace hers. This is the answer! - You want to sacrifice this child? - Sacrifice her so you can live. Yes! I won't lose you! I can't lose you. - June, look at me. Listen to me. - Be quiet! Don't listen to him. You're June McDaniel. - Be quiet! - You're June... You're June! You're June. Keep calm, come to no harm. - June, I need you to shift. - Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. June. I need you to shift, June! - No! - I will kill this boy if I have to. I will kill this boy. June. Please, just... Just don't hurt him. June! June! June, I need you to touch Runa. June, I need you to touch Runa. Do it! June! - June... June, do it! - Ben... Wh... What you said before, in the video. You were right. You... You did save me. - You don't need to do this. - Yes, I do. Yes, I do, my love. June! June! - Are you okay? June! - Are you all right? - Oh, come on, Harry. - The keys. - Are you okay, June? - You've fired a rifle before, have you? - Please, don't hurt her! - I said give me the keys. Are you all right? June! June! Are you okay? June? Come on. What's going on in there? June! June! June! Are you okay? Runa, I... What are you doing? - June! - Runa... - Hey. Hey, it's okay. - Harry. It's okay. I'm sorry. You and your family should leave. Get away from this place. I'm sorry about Freya. You should know that she's... She's still alive. I've met her. Come on. Bye, June. Runa, put the gun down. - Come on, put the gun down. - The day Freya ran away... she told me everything you did to her. Steinar. The shifts. The memories. And deep down, I knew what she said was true, but I told her she was lying. Because I was, uh... weak. My daughter, she should have been the most important thing in the world to me. She wasn't just running from you, she was running from me, too. - Runa, listen to me... - Don't! Don't. All this effort to bring June here. Planning for her to shift into me, trying to save me. But when my mind finally failed, and I'd given up the ghost, what were you going to do with me? Lock me away? And forget about me? Would June help you with the work, with the other women? Be your partner? Would she sleep in our bed? I would love you like I always have. He doesn't love you. He needs you. He's always needed you because he knows he's nothing without you. Yes, and maybe I'm nothing without him. Don't say that. My love... We built something together. For us, remember? Don't listen to him. Sigrid... Sigrid was right. He's a monster. You know he is. Freya? Freya! Freya. Runa. Runa. Runa, Runa, Runa, Runa, Runa, Runa... I can't forgive you. I'm not gonna fight with you, either. I love her. I know you do. Did he say anything about me? My dad? When you were together? "You should meet my son." Did you really think I'd leave you alone in that place? I don't know. June. Give me your hand. Okay. It's you... and me. Always. We could still make this a real home. For us two. Like we always... Stop! Stop. Stop. Please. Look at me. Answer me. I'm not Freya. Not anymore. I had to. My girl. You came back to me. I came back for June. Your daughter's gone. Why did you choose him over me? Because... I was scared. Weak. Because I needed him. All those years, living rough, moving from place to place, I stayed with you. I looked after you. I protected you. I was the child. I needed you. He only loved you for what you are. I loved you for who you are. I'm... I'm so, so sorry for... for everything. Please... Please... Don't leave me again. Please. You should meet my son. My mum's on the docks with the police. - They're waiting for us. - What do you mean? My mum was going through the Pennines case. She had it up all over the walls at home. She had pictures of you, of Lil, the nurse... videos of the eyes and stuff. She had CCTV of you next to my dad from that night. She said you were dangerous, but I told her you're not. Sweetheart, listen to me. You don't need to be scared. It's going to be all right. - Come on. Get in the car. - What are we gonna do? No. - No, I'm not leaving you. - Wherever you go, I can't be with you. I've only ever caused you pain. I'm sorry for what I did to you. June. I love you. Now, go. Go on, love. Thank you. For looking after June and Ryan. Are you sure you want to do this? You're welcome. - How far to the other side? - Maybe an hour. Chris, come on. Okay, listen to me. That's Elena Askelaand, the main suspect in the Pennines Five case. Where's Harry? - Is he here? - He's okay. - I'm not leaving without my boy. - It's me you want, isn't it? I took Lewis from you. June's like you, isn't she? - She's gonna hurt Harry, just like you hurt Lewis. - Never! Keep calm, come to no harm. Keep calm, come to no harm. - Keep calm, come to no harm. - We need to go. - Take her. - Let her go, please! Chris! - Harry, slow down! - No, no, no. If they catch us, it's over. They think you're dangerous. June? June. Oh, no. Oh, God. Hey. Hey, June. Please. Hey, June. Please wake up. Wake up! Wake up. Harry, what's happening? It's okay. It's okay. You're gonna be okay. Okay? No, Harry. No. Don't touch me. Don't. Oh, no. It's gonna be all right. Okay? But, June, I need you to listen to me. Okay? - I'm scared. - I know. I know. Me, too. Me, too, but I need you to do what I say. Can you do that for me? I need you to shift into me. Become me and find someone who can help you. No. No. - What... What if I hurt you? - We have to try something. If you become me, you just can't be hurt, can you? No, I can't. I can't do it. You can. Yes, you can. Please. Please, June. I can't, Harry. I can't.I can't. I can't. If you don't do it... you're gonna die. So, please. I love you, Harrison Polk. I know. And I love you, too. Yeah. I'll see you again soon. It's okay. It's okay. Harry! - Don't touch me! You'll hurt him! - Harry! No, no! Wake up! Please! Harry! I'm June McDaniel. Keep calm, come to no harm. I'm... June McDaniel. Keep calm, come to no harm. Harry. Harry. Harry. Harry. Please. Come on. Come on. Please! Come back! Come back! Harry, please. Please, come back! I'll see you again. Soon. No!
