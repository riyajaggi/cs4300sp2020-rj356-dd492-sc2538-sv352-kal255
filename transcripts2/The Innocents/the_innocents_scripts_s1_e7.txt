 Come on! Through the legs! Watch out! Wait, wait! Oh! Ah! You want to be one of those. Don't you? Anywhere but here. Yeah, I know the feeling. You look like you fit in perfectly. I just make a lot of noise so they don't ask me any real questions. What are you afraid of them asking? Oh, that would be telling.

 No, seriously. Maybe I'm afraid of people finding out I'm not who they think I am. And who are you? I don't know yet. Hmm. If you could, would you just... just get as far away as possible? No. I think I'd like to find somewhere that feels like a real home. All right. Ah... I hope you're happy, corrupting me like this. Thank you. I... I did want to hear a little bit more about the nurse you mentioned, in London, your experience with her.

 I mean, she's still... she's still with me... kind of. How so? When I felt that... baby inside me, I... I remembered every injection, every negative test. And her memories were from five months - before you met her? - Yeah. Uh, so, you could access her memories? Well... It's hard to explain. I could feel her... her thoughts as well as mine. And there were things that she could do that suddenly... suddenly I could do. What does that mean? Ah... It... Well, it means that you're more than just a little special. You knew what me and my mum were going through. Three years. How could you look me in the eye? I'm sorry. I really am. I had to do everything in my power to protect my kids. You're not even her dad. You locked her up. Drugged her, John. - Too scared to let her be herself. - Yeah, I was. I'm still scared now. Look, we can't help her if we don't work together. Harry... Harry? Scrambled or... What are you doing here? John McDaniel. He lied. Elena was still in Falham Bridge that night. - It's pixelated. - It's her. It looks like a reflection. Where's she standing? Close enough to harm my husband, and moments from the pub where two of the victims were found. Lillian Banks collapsed in a London club. Spontaneous coma. She was taken by ambulance to Princess Victoria Hospital. June was with her. They were admitted together. The nurse in London, the one with the vibrating eyes, she was treating June in the same hospital just a few hours later. Lewis, Lillian, Deborah. These cases are connected, Doug. Mother and daughter, they're responsible. Well, what are they doing to these people? - Chris, talk to me. - Harry's gone. He went after her this morning. Something terrible is happening. My son is in real danger. This is DCI Squirries. Can you put a ping on a UK mobile for me, please? Listen, I know you blame me for putting June in danger, and you're right. You might have locked her down, but... I wasn't strong enough to look after her. How could anyone know the right thing to do? Fair Isle. Christ. June's strong-willed. She's always had a mind of her own. And in London, she knew what she was. She asked me to be honest, and I couldn't even give her that. You need to know, June didn't run away to hurt you. Okay? That's the last thing that she wanted. Is tea okay? The, uh, cocoa looked a bit - like mouse droppings. - Thanks. My dad was gonna take me to a Scottish island. Away from everything, everyone. Ah, yeah. People do extreme things when they're afraid. Reason can become a little clouded. I met someone in London. - A girl like me. - A shifter? Who was that? Her name is Kam. We really thought she could help us. We... trusted her. And in the end, she hurt us. Well, that sounds typical, I'm afraid. The women that I know with this condition tend to drive people away who offer them friendship. What they do accept, and what they need, is community. Which is what I'm trying to build for your mother and for you. Why did she leave me? That's a question you're gonna have to ask her yourself. Please, I... I need to know. She will tell you. But in her own time. All right. I'll get us on the road. - You see if you can find us a map, okay? - Yeah. - A detailed one. - Sure. Harry, are you okay? Mum? Look, I know you don't think I'm doing the right thing. You've always done everything you can to help people. You want to help this girl, but you don't know what she's capable of. I do. And every time she changes, I feel like I know her more. They ended our family, Harry. They broke it. Things go wrong in love, that's what you said. - There's nothing you can do about it. - But you can do something. Please don't hang up. Just listen to me. I love her, Mum. And I'm not asking you to understand. I have to do this. Harry. He's in Norway, Bergen Airport. The road runs out in about a mile, so we'll leave the Jeep and go on foot. And listen, if you don't mind, when we get to Sanctum, I'd rather you not mention the shifter you've met. Why? She's got problems, but... you know, maybe you could... You could help her, too. Well, it's on my mind, I've thought about it, but I can't risk destabilizing the women in my care. - Yeah? - Yeah. You okay? Uh, yeah. It's really suffering. Don't watch, okay? Go on. Hey! What do you think you're doing? - Get out of the way! - Wait! Wait! You are not allowed in here. We know they're in Bergen. Where are they going, Ryan? To be together. That's all they want. You've lost them. Oh. Thank you. I'm Elena Askelaand. Thirty-nine years old. Born south of Bergen. I'm Elena Askelaand. Thirty-nine years old. We made it! June... this is Runa. Welcome. - Thanks. - I got some supplies, too. Ah, and this is Sigrid. Oh, my goodness, you look just like your mother. Where is she? I need to see her. - Well... - Your mother wants to see you, too. She's thought about nothing else. But for her, that's a problem. We'll talk about your trigger when the time's right. But for your mother, it's bound up in love, and so she's probably feeling a little volatile right now. Uh, because of me? Because she loves you. Yes, she just needs time to acclimatize to you being here. And while she does, there is plenty for us to do. You brought me here to see her, didn't you? - That's what you said. - Yes, - but we just need to be careful. - Well, then, let's be careful. - Ben? - You know the dangers, Runa. But if June can wait a day, then... I'm sure they'll be fine. Holen Fjord. The place Kam remembered. The closest village. Wait here. Hi, uh, excuse me. Um... We're trying to get to... here. I'm gonna bring our son home. Okay? Will you take me, too? I'll be back. Thanks. Someone else came this way. Your... your dresses, did you... - Did you make them yourselves? - Yes, yes. We only had plain fabrics, but Sigrid found a way to dye it with, uh, blackberry, wasn't it? - Black currants. - Black currants, yes. Cheered us all up a bit. And you don't... You don't touch... uh, ever? - It comes naturally after a while. - Yes. You're surrounded by people who understand you here, June. - You'll never be on your own. - I haven't been on my own. You mean, you've met other shifters? No, um... His name's Harry. Harry. I see. Interesting. - Is that for my mum? - Mm-hmm. Sigrid's our latest success story. So, she's... she's cured? We would never say "cured." I believe she'll always have the physical capacity to shift... But she can... control it? It does take work, uh... Yeah. I'm ready. I'm just so happy that you're back with us, Freya. This is June, Runa. Yes, of course it is. Do you mind if I go and lie down? - Of course not. - No, please do. No reception out here. No kidding. John. That must be it. No boats. I guess we'll have to find another way around. I'm Elena Askelaand. Thirty-nine years old. Born south of Bergen. I'm Elena Askelaand. Thirty-nine years old. Born south of Bergen. I'm Elena Askelaand. I know that you're not ready. But you have to be. You were away too long. Look at you. Something in me was hoping you hadn't changed. Isn't that stupid? Because look how beautiful you are. Can I come inside? No, Sigrid will be back for my tray. Is there somewhere we can go? I can't see anything yet. Just keep going. Get up, John. Come on. Are you all right? She got as far away from me as she possibly could. Come on, mate. Come on. That's it. There we go. In the video, you said that Dad made you leave. I was getting more and more unstable. Uh... He was worried I'd hurt you or your brother. You couldn't control it. I... I get that now. Uh... You have to tell me everything that happened. Why you left. I promise, I'm not gonna blame you. Can't you tell me a bit about you first? Huh? I've missed so much. Now we have the chance to be happy. We can help each other to find a stable place, and then... then we can stay here, together. June? Bendik! Ben? I want to get well more than anything, but I... But what? Not just for me. I've found someone. - I'm in love. - No, you can't be, you're just a child. No, his name's Harry. Harry Polk. Dad was worried that I wasn't gonna get my exams, - and then, when I started school... - I don't want to hear any more. See? They're on the boat. Yeah, but he... he knows what I am. He's seen it happen. - He helps bring me back. - Elena! June! Will you come back to the shore, please? No. You don't know who or what you are yet. You can't have love, June. I'm sorry, but you can't, - whatever you think you feel. - What are you talking about? - Harry's... Harry's everything. - No, no, listen to me. Falling in love is the most powerful feeling in the world. I know that, but it's dangerous. - I don't care. - You will because you'll hurt him. I would never hurt him. If you think that, you don't know me. I know you better than anyone! And if you stay with this boy, you will kill him. No! June! No! Ah! June? June! Swim! Wait a second. Wait, June's shifted. Say something. Please, say something. June! Wait, stay here. Stay here. They're both conscious. What's happening, Ben? I don't know. I've never seen this. June! Will you keep your eyes on the mirror? On yourself? Can you tell me what's happening? Elena, I don't know your daughter very well, I'm gonna need you to help me bring her back. Will you talk to her? - Talk about the things that make her June. - Uh, she, uh... She wears my nightie and... and pretends she's a ghost and... You sleep when I sing to you in Norwegian. She's not a child anymore, Elena. I've been out in the woods. I broke the rules. - I wouldn't do that if I were you, June. - What... What is she talking about? You might see something you're not ready for. - She's experiencing your memories. - That's not possible. No, we can't do that. Well, I think June can. It's part of her gift. I think when the gene is passed down from mother to daughter, it evolves. Would you stop her? She wants to know why you've left. She's going to find out. No! June, you can't go there! June! June, please! Stop her! Look alive, people. It's Friday night. I've not seen you before, have I? - Uh, it's my first class. - My name is Lewis Polk. June! Stop her! Stop her! In this space, in your self-portraits, I'm gonna demand that you be truthful. That you see yourselves for everything that you are. June! June! Talk to me! June, please! You know what I'm capable of. I'm not well, John. You've been stable so long. What's changed? Whatever it is, just... get it under control. Please! Please! Talk to me, June! June, please! - I love you. - No, no, no! - Please don't... - I... I love you. These past months, I knew you were scared of something. Now I know what it is. You're scared to love. You sleep with me, but you're always holding something back. And I want more. There's something wrong with me. I... I hurt everyone I'm with. I think you feel the same way I do. And I'll take you... any way it could work. Will you take me, too? You can't go there! No, June! Do something! June! Don't! June. June. Will you take me, too? Uh... June. It just happened. I couldn't stop it, any of it. Don't look at me like that. - Don't look at me. - What have you done? No! June! Yeah. One of them fucking perverts, eh? Wearing a dress! You should be ashamed of yourself! All right, mate... You'll be paying for those! Oi! Who do you think you are? June, can you hear me? Stop her! June! No! Ah. Are you all right? Oh, no. John? Why aren't those people waking up, Elena? I know how this thing works. I've seen it. - Something had to be different. - I changed straight from one into the next. I didn't come back to my own body. So they're trapped somehow? I stopped taking the sedatives. I needed to feel. To feel what, Elena? Love. Pack a bag. Now. They'll come for you. You'll have to leave. June, can you hear me? If you can hear me, tell me your name. Elena Askelaand. No. - No, no. - And... And where do you live? Cabin three, Sanctum. Elena, your memories are consuming her. No! Don't be me! - What do you think? - Hmm? They're definitely different. Out of everyone I've ever met, I choose you. Don't be me! You can't be me! Where's my girl? We're losing her. Hey, hey! This is private property! Stay away! My daughter's here! Turn back. I'll shoot, I mean it! Sigrid? - Who are you? - Where's June? - We need to see her! - We're her family. Please! Treat the man inside the house. Keep him there. Are you Harry? Yeah. Elena Askelaand. Thirty-nine years old. A broken arm... Father, Thor, carried me home. - What's going on? - Ben, this is Harry. - June? - He can reach her. Will you get out of here? - I can handle this. - Ben, listen to me. June's fading. She's slipping away from us. - We need him. - I need to be in there. You can talk to her, but do not touch her. June? No! June... Look at me. I came to find you. But now you have to come back to me. I know you're there, June McDaniel. Just listen to my voice. You're here. And right now, who do you choose to be? Okay? No one else matters. Just me and you. You don't know what she's done. I know. I know. But, June... it's not your fault. I'm June McDaniel. June! June. The people you took that night... they never woke up. They're locked in. All of them. - Trapped. Catatonic. - No, no. - That can't be. - My dad... Lewis. You trapped him, too. He's a shell like the rest of them. But now you know why you can't be together. No. Love doesn't do the same things to me as it does to you. I never hurt those people. And I will have love. I'm not you. June... June, it's okay. I've got you. No... - Harry, June... - Just back off! Just leave us alone! It's all right. This is extraordinary, my love. This is exactly what we wondered, what would happen... Shifter into another shifter. June was being consumed by her mother's memories. I mean, there were two Elenas, both... talking like her, thinking like her. And we only just got June back. You knew about this extra level to June's shift? Yeah, she told me on the journey from London. She's... the first. I would have thought you'd share that with me, your partner. Well, I'm sharing it with you now. Is she the first, Ben? You know she is. Kam told me about Halvorson. She was here from before. She said he abused her. No, that's not true. Kam was... was dangerous. She hurt us. And I talked to Ben about it, and he said that she'd never been here. - Well, I believed her. - Kam was... She wasn't well. You've seen what she's capable of. June... we have to leave. But... but my dad's leg... He's... ... gonna need to recover and... Harry, I've only just found my mum. Yeah? And now you know what she did. But that's why she... Why she left, why she came here. That woman downstairs, Sigrid, she's cured, Harry. - I need help. - Yes. Yes. Help. From someone you trust, - not a man who sent a thug to kidnap you. - No, Steinar... Steinar is sick. Halvorson left him in London, and... - Halvorson? You don't need him. - You don't know that! We knew nothing... when we ran away. Nothing. But we got through all of it together. June. Look at me. I'm here. I can always get you back. Please. You can't... You can't stay in here, they... they don't allow it. What the fuck do we care what they allow? June... Do you remember when it was just... me and you? Just for tonight. Please. Oh. All is quiet, my love. I miss Freya. Not talking about the past was your rule. You insisted. But I'm starting to forget her. Forget everything. What have we learned from us being together? There's always a way. Nothing's impossible. There's a new start coming for us. And I can see it. Clear as day. Yeah. Mind if I come in? I know what it's like to love someone who's a shifter. The worry that you can't protect them, or that you might lose them. And that constant drive to understand what's happening. It's been my life, too, so... So please, ask me anything. We're all still learning here. - Maybe you think I'm dangerous. - That's exactly what I think. You see, we met a shifter in London. She warned me about you. She said that you hurt her. Yeah, June mentioned her. Sounds like a very... disturbed and delusional young woman. You know that Elena and Sigrid choose to be here, right? Look, Harry... June is a very special girl, but she needs help, and as far as I can tell, I am the only person who can do that. You know, before, when she changed, June was always herself inside. Then this time... See, I almost lost the person that I love to a monster, so please spare me, 'cause you... you don't know how that feels. I do, Harry. I really do. Look, I... I don't have any secrets. I really want to help you understand what it is we can offer June. I'd like to show you what it is we do here. Yeah. What I'm trying to achieve here is the diffusion of their emotional triggers. This stuff... This stuff is just... creepy. I can imagine it looks that way. There's a lot of old tech in here. Eighties, mainly. Secondhand. But it does the job. You know, we all have the same reflex to immediate threat: an acute stress response which prepares the body to survive. We call it fight or flight. But for these women, in these moments, they have a more extreme, and I would suggest, a more advanced physiological reflex. So what you're saying is, shifting is a defense mechanism. Yes, yes. And they are genetically wired to transform their basic physical structure. It's utterly extraordinary. Which is why I've dedicated my life to protecting these women. But... you've been through a difficult and unusual experience, so I understand it's not easy to trust. You have... no idea what we've been through. And June's not just a shifter or part of your experiment. No. And it has to be her decision. I mean, if she wants to leave, I can't keep her here. - Really? - Of course. Why would I? This room's as much for their safety as it is for mine. - In here, I can control the shift. - Well, you didn't control it earlier. Yeah, that's June's. Well, you can take it to her if you like. Hey! Hey! Hey! Let me out! Hey! Help! Help! Ben! Help! Are you going hiking? Yes, visiting family. ♪ Time stands still ♪ ♪ Call your name ♪ ♪ Don't you dare ♪ ♪ Fall in love ♪ Let me out!
