 Harry? Harry, is it me? - What? - Am I me? Yeah, you're you. It... it's over. - Is Steinar here? - No. No, no. We lost him. We lost him. It's okay. It's all right. Hello. - Well, that's how I like to start my day. - What, frightening the locals? Hey, we are locals. And I don't know about you, but...

 this is my dream house. - What are you doing? - Ready? Whoo! Oh, man, I stink. Oh, so it's not me, then. Mm... Bubblegum and bleach. Oh, your eye looks better. Yeah? No. What are you feeling? I don't know. Lovely spot for a hot date. Hey, you're right, I could do better. A lot better. Oi!

 Come on! John, I'm at the farm. Where are you? Have you heard anything? Just... ... call me, okay? - We need to get you home. - No! June trusts me. She's in trouble. Those men... I've gotta be there. - I can do it. - Yeah. Good lad. No sign of Elena yet? No. You will break through to her. I know you will. This looks delicious. I think maybe today's gonna be my final session. That nervous feeling in the pit of your stomach, it's not fear. It's excitement, possibility. I'm feeling it, too. So, we're still meeting at 11:00? Yeah, 11:00. - Thanks, Sigrid. - You're welcome. Are we worried about Elena? The last thing we want for her is to cut herself off. - Could it help to tell her about June? - Absolutely not. That could be dangerous. If she knows that June is in danger, that will jeopardize all our progress. I think what Elena needs right now is comfort, reassurance. How about I go and talk to her? Yes. That could be very helpful. Mm-hmm. Elena? Doors unlocked and unobstructed at all times, you know that. No privacy, no belongings, no sharing of secrets. It's hard at first. It will get easier. How are you feeling after yesterday? If we don't participate in the program, do we have to leave? The therapy isn't easy for any of us. But surely you want to get better? I know that June ran away from home. What? I thought Ben told you. She's like us. A shifter. What? She's... Are you sure? She's got the gift. No, it's not a gift! It's a curse! I don't want her to be like me! I wouldn't wish this on anyone. - Now go, please. - Yes, yes. Yes. Of course. If we got a tent, we could camp. - I don't know, maybe up in the park. - Come on, we need our bags. And that cash card that Ryan gave me. Yeah, but we can't go back to the flat. It's not safe. What are we gonna do without money? We've gotta risk it. All right. But I'm going on my own. Okay. Hey, look at that. - Isn't that sweet? - No, it's not. I like the reindeer. Oi, Dee Dee! Get over yourself! Come here! Hey! All right? Don't worry about her. Soppiest dog in Hackney. - I'll do you that for a tenner. - Oh, no, I'm all right. Thanks. All right, all right. You talked me into it. A fiver. Just for you. - No, it's okay. - Ah, come on. You're killing me, guys. Right, work with me. What've you got? We don't have anything. Okay. That does make negotiations a little bit harder. Look, mate, honestly, we're good. Cheers, though. Thanks. Hey, guys... Um, look, you can tell me if I'm out of line, but... you know, I've been where you are now. No place to go, right? Certainly, no place you want to go back to. You don't have to look so serious. I'm not the bizzies. Look, I'll tell you what. I've gotta go see a man about a dog basket. - So, why don't you make yourself at home? - What? Yeah. Do me a favor, get all these valuables inside for me, and then you... I don't know, get some rest, charge your phone. I'll be back in about an hour. If you're here when I get back, we can have tea and... you can not tell me all about it. Cool? I'm gonna take your silence as a yes. Enjoy. Dee Dee! Come on, darling. What do you think? I don't know. This is harder every year. How'd it go? I told her that June is a shifter. Runa. I'm sorry, I messed up. What happened in there? I got confused. It's getting worse. Hey. You fell asleep finally. I need air. I need some air. Are you okay? I lied. I'm not well. No shit. Can you tell me anything more? - The money is real. - It's not the money. It's not... I hadn't seen you in eight years, man. It's not about the money. The girl's gone. I don't know what to do. Maybe one of the kids in the house knows where they went. I don't know. Well, this is... weird. How does he know we're not gonna nick anything? He probably reckons we're not gonna steal a table lamp - when we've got nowhere to plug it in. - Yeah. Hey. I can tell when you're thinking about your mum. Steinar knew her name. He knows where she is. None of us do. Are you sure about that? What does that mean? June... what if John does know more than he's letting on? What about your mum and about what's happening to you. You don't understand. If he... If he knew for a second where she was, he would have told us. No, he... he felt just as abandoned as we did. Yeah. Do you think it's really all right if I take a shower? Yeah. Go on. I'll keep a lookout. Thanks. June would be happy here. Safe. I want that. I love her so much, but... what you want from me, the past, the pain, I... I can't go back there. - Yes, you can. - I'll break. - I'll go mad. - I won't let that happen to you, Elena. Listen, I know it's difficult digging up what's buried, but you're gonna have to face this. You're gonna have to face June. And what are you gonna tell her? How are you gonna teach her, now that you know that she is the same as you? I felt it from the minute I held her in my arms. And ever since, I put myself first. So, what kind of mother am I? Listen, when June gets here, she's gonna have two things that you never had: a support system and a role model. That last part is up to you. Three years. And I've done nothing but work. Today was the most important day, and he's with her, again. Probably my final session, and he forgot! I'm sorry. I know it's selfish and paranoid. - Please, don't tell him. - No. Thank you. What was your final test like? Oh, the... therapy was very different back then. Go on! Only us. In case you hadn't guessed that already. Shh! June's sleeping. Sorry, she just crashed out. It's... it's fine. - She must've needed it. - Yeah. You found the tea bags, then? Mine's two sugars. Cool. Drop and give me 30! About one for every happy, satisfying year that I smoked. I'd love to, but my lungs are fucked. You know what's coming your way, right? Come in and shut the door. Any word from Harry? He can't keep it up. He wouldn't do that to Lewis. How can you bear it? - What? - You know what. This promotion. The office, the bloody cake on the table out there, it was all gonna be yours. - Should have been. - Who's this helping, Doug? Death by half measures. It's always the same with you. - What? - You wanted this job. So, get off the fence for once in your life. Is this about the job, or is it still about The Pennines Five? About Lewis. Mackey called time on the investigation. It was the right thing to do. The river had dried up. Now, I might be the DCI now, but that's not gonna change. Chris, stay, please. Look, I'm an idiot. ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ ♪ And so say all of us ♪ It's me! - Hey. Hey, wake up. - Hmm? People. Hey! There they are! Look at you! So much better. Bit of color in your faces. Get yourself up here. This is Tom, Skip, Nehal. I'm Lil! She calls this yoga. - But I don't think it's gonna catch on. - Hush now. Consider myself hushed. Give me a hand? - All right. - Not you. Charming. You all right? - Have you got a name? - Harry. - Ah. - This is June. She's my girlfriend. - Wow! Your eyes are so beautiful. - All right. You can stop flirting. So, we're going to be in Shoreditch tonight. We've got a load of what the party people want. Twenty percent of what you make. Cash in hand. Easy money... Honestly. Unless you've got a better offer. Their car's been found. Stratford. Did you confirm registration? It's pretty smashed up. - Any sign of injury? - No. - Here's the address. - Thanks. Nice, eh? Not so chatty now, eh? Is this your wife? No, not yet. But I've proposed many times. She wants to be her "perfect self" before we get married. I can understand her. Full of silicone, paid for by this idiot. No. She's just... It's just a few operations. It's not... It's not a big deal. She saw me walk by in a bar... and fell head over heels. Yes, she must have hit her head pretty hard. Fucking... fucking hilarious. Should we just... follow one of them, ask a few questions, and just keep it calm? I just want to know where they went. Plain and simple. Well, this might speed things up. London's a collection of little villages, is it? What a shithole. I'll be back. June? June, it's Dad! Are you here? June? Was this girl here? Have you seen her? Yeah, yeah. She was here last night with a boy, but they left. Long gone. Without her bag? It's the truth. It looked like they were on the run. I think I can guess from who. They were nice kids. They were here. But they left. It's got her name on it! Did you get it for her? So, you were in on it. You helped her plan it all. Look. Christine keeps calling. Where the hell have you been? You can't just disappear. Well, you weren't doing anything. You seem very calm that your son's missing. I'm not calm! The car they were driving has been found. Crashed and abandoned in Stratford. No obvious sign of injury, but we can't exclude the possibility that one or both of them are hurt. You have to get down there. I'm in London now. - How could you not tell me? - Ryan had the address they were headed to. Have you seen them? Are they... They left the place last night. The car was found in the early hours of this morning. - Christ. - In the meantime, you and Ryan can make yourselves useful on the ground. Walk into hospitals with photographs. Ask if anyone's seem them. Security guards, receptionists. I'm on my way. No, stay. Someone should be there in case they come home. We stay in touch with any news. - Anything at all. - Agreed. You really think I'll get in? They'll be paying you. You've been to a club before? - No. - But you've been out drinking? - No. - What, seriously? It is the easiest thing. There's three things you need to know. One, if you're dancing and it feels good, trust me, it looks good. Two, a drink isn't just a drink. It's a contract. Some guy buys you a vodka tonic, you'll never be able to shake him off. He might think he can touch you, which is never okay, unless you want him to. Three, it is always more fun with the girls. - Don't tell Shane I said that. - No. - It's all right. - Yeah. - So, what's Harry gonna do then? - Shane's got a hundred tricks. - All right, hold your breath. - Okay. Ugh! It's a fashion thing. You don't understand. Good. That's the reaction I was hoping for. Lucky boy. I like Harry. Bet he keeps you busy, too. What do you mean? Boys that age are engines that run on sex. They can't keep their minds on anything else, can they? I guess that's why they say girls mature faster. They get over the pure lust stage. Except me. No one ever said that about me. - What are you waiting for? - You! You all right, then?

What's... what's happening to me? June? June, are you in here? What are you doing in here? Hey. Give it a suck for me, babe! - Come on. Breathe. - No! Just get out! Just get out! - Just breathe. - I don't know who I am! You're with me, okay? And I will never ever let you go. Okay? But I need you to look at me. Just listen to my voice. Yeah? This isn't forever. It's just for now. Yeah? - Just for now? - Yeah. It's just... just for now. - Harry? - Yeah. I've got you. I've got you. Look, that was good gear, all right? Lil has always had a handle on herself. I don't understand what happened. Hey, hey, hey. Come here. It wasn't the drugs, Harry. It was me. I thought it was Steinar, that he did something to me, but he's not here now. It's happened again. - I did this to her. - No, you don't know that. - Yes, I do! - Are you friends with this girl? Were you with her tonight? We need to know what she's taken. Her name's Lil. - Is it Ecstasy? - I think so. Right. Want to get in? Harry? Look, I am... I'm sorry, all right? You take this. - I'm not taking it. - Take it. I'm all right. Hey! Hey, sorry. Excuse me. Um, my girlfriend's in there. I can only take one in the back. She'll be at the Princess Victoria. You know what I'm capable of. I'm gonna demand that you be truthful! What do you see when you look in the mirror? Pack a bag. Stop the tape! No! - Harry. - Hey. - I was worried you wouldn't find me. - I will always find you. They checked me in, too. Come here. Did you give your real name? Yeah, but I'm not seeing the nurse, Harry. - I can't. - It's okay. How's Lil? She's in a coma. Doctors won't tell me anything else. My dad was in a coma. It's just never been the same since. Harry? You know I never meant to hurt Lil. - Or you. - I just... I just don't understand. I just don't understand what's happening. Or why it's happening to you. To us. I can't wait any longer. I have to see her. You go ahead. I'll be here, yeah? Okay. June McDaniel, 16. We think they were in an accident. There's nothing in the system. Polk? Harry Polk? I'm sorry, nothing's come up. Have you tried the other hospitals? Christ. Are we ever gonna find her? What's happened? It's my back. - I can't... - Jesus, Ryan, I'm sorry. - No, I can keep going. - I know you can. Let's just get you sorted first. Harry? Mum? Are you hurt? I don't know if I can do this. - Mum, I don't think I'm strong enough. - Hey. - It's... it's all right. I'm not angry. - Let me come and get you. - Weird things are happening. Just... Just tell me exactly where you are. June is... June is different. - What? - She can change. And I keep wondering... ... if she's really gonna hurt me. That's love, sweetheart. Things go wrong, and there's nothing you can do about it. It's no one's fault. I know, I know, you're right It's not her fault. Come on. Let's get you home. Where are you? I'm sorry, Mum. Give Dad a hug for me, okay?
