 It's been a while since we saw you here. I was so sorry to hear about your parents. Yeah. Crispbread and liver pâté are coming soon. Thanks. Ben. Hey! Hey, how... how are you? I didn't know if I'd see you again since we ended our sessions. Have a seat. What are you doing in Ålesund?

 I'm... I'm still off the booze, but let me get you a beer. No. Something's happened to me, Steinar. And I need you to hear me out. He's a foreign quack with no references. But I had to find someone. It's Christmas Eve, and if we don't assess her, we're not insured. We'll talk later. Goodbye. Ah, Dr. Bendik Halvorson. Nice to meet you. Where is the patient? This way. We have no name and no address.

 I need your signature, so I can give her medicine. - My Norwegian's pretty basic. - Okay, okay. English is, uh, fine. Do you have a history of bipolar disorder in your family? Do you suffer hallucinations? Where... Where is she? Where did you last see her? Paranoid schizophrenic. Pretty textbook. No! Don't touch. Don't touch. Did you try to hurt yourself? You can't stop it. Please. Depressive episodes are common and can be the result of any number of things. Now... for us to be able to help you, we'll need to give you a blood test... ... and a physical examination. No, I... I'm not insane. We've got enough to admit her. Just wait, please. She's having a seizure. Help me restrain her? He collapsed. There were two of him. She had his face, his body. - She was him. - Ben... are you on something? Hey, is... is this a practical joke? Listen... You saved my life. You brought me back from the brink. I'd do anything for you, but this isn't... Your parents' house near Holen Fjord, have you sold it yet? No, it's too remote. I wouldn't ask if I didn't have to, but we need to leave tonight. Now, there's gonna be a lot of hard work ahead. And I'm gonna need a man like you. A good man, a partner, essentially, who's capable of keeping a secret. - A partner? - Yes. It... sounds like you need - a lot of things. - I'm offering you a new life, meaning, complete collaboration, and a founding role in what is gonna be one of the greatest discoveries in medical history. Steinar, please, just come out to the car for a minute. You can make your own decision. Dr. Halvorson knew you'd need to see it for yourself. Who are you? My name is Runa. I just... I can't stop... ... seeing Lil's face. You know, I've never seen someone look like that, and... I did that to her. - I'm a monster. - You're not a monster, June. You're not a monster. You're a good person. But we need help. Okay? We just need to understand... what's happening to you. When did you start working for this cult? It's not a cult. - I've told you. - Okay. It's a sanctuary. People go to sanctuaries of their own free will... I'm bringing the girl to her mother. Better than living on the street with some idiot. What do you get then? I know what my share is, but... what's the total amount? It's not about money. No, no... No. It never is... with cults. - Better? - Yeah, yeah. Good. Here. Well, the next hospital's in Mile End. - Christine? - The Princess Victoria. June's been admitted. On our way. Sit tight. I'll call you when we get there. They know something. Even though your friend's awake, she's still ill. The drugs she took caused a serious reaction. Did you hear a brand? - Or a street name? - No. No, um, the symptoms, they happened before the drugs. What? Listen, um... June's not herself. Her body, it keeps changing, and it's her eyes, it's her voice... - What're you talking about? - Can you try everything, like an X-ray, or CAT scan, or MRI? - We're doing everything we can. - Please. Look, there is something really wrong with my girlfriend, and it's dangerous. - You need to calm down. - I am calm. Look, I'm calm, but you're not listening to me. Look, June is dangerous. And she can't control it, and I can't help her! Give me a urine sample when you're ready, and I'll need to take some bloods. No, no. No needles. No. June? - You'll be fine! - No, no, no! Don't, don't, don't! June... June! Harry... Uh... shit. Hey. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Deborah? Deborah? Please, please. Shit! Shit, shit, shit. Uh, okay, okay. - We need to get you out of here. - What? We... we can't leave her. It's a hospital. They can help her. Okay, come on. Let's wait here and see if they find her. Okay. June McDaniel. She was brought in last night. - If you could be patient... - No, I can't. She's my daughter. She's just turned 16. McDaniel... June. She's in examination on West Ward. If you'd like to take a seat... Third floor. - Where are the examination rooms? - At the end, to the right. Ryan's here! - How did they find us? - I don't know. But we have to keep moving. Oh, God. - I'm looking for someone. - What's going on? - Excuse me. - I'll be with you in one minute. - June? June! - June! I've never seen Dad look like that. Harry? What if you were right? What if he knew what was coming? What if he hid it from me? That would explain a lot. Come on. - There's the boy. - But that's not the girl. It's them. You've got to be kidding me. You okay? It feels weird. It's... heavy. Come on. How did you know? I didn't. Anything could have happened. And she was already exhausted from therapy. I shouldn't have told her about June. I didn't realize what I was doing. And it was the same with my mother. The short-term memory goes first. I've been thinking. Perhaps I should start testing again. But... but you're re-centered. You're the proof of what we're capable of here. Imagine how that would look to the others. The therapy works. It's my mind. I'm... I'm less stable. You know I've been struggling. What's this really about, hmm? I know it's difficult to share me, but Sigrid and Elena are both at critical stages... This is about me, for once, Ben. I don't trust myself. I trust you. I should take those new seedlings in. There's no rush. You don't have to do that now. I want to. - I need to work. - I understand that. All right, I'll walk you down. I've been thinking about what you said. You're right, and I'm ready. Ready to be well... for June. It'll be tough, but we'll be with you every step of the way. I'm very proud of you, you know? What you said to me, it... it made sense. Good. Are you ready? I hope so. It was past midnight. My dad sat down on my bed. He said, "I don't love your mother. I can't pretend anymore." He'd been seeing this other woman, Ava Dahl, for a long time. He was packed and ready to leave. "It doesn't mean that I love you any less." "You'll kill her, Daddy, if you go." "Ava's pregnant." I hated the way he used her name, as if she were part of our family. My papa. Mine and Mum's. I wasn't going to let him leave us. One moment, he tried to wrestle me off, and then... he fell into my arms, slumped. I held him in the dark, waiting for him to cry, and then... his phone was flashing. It was Ava. I answered. "I hate you. You've broken us. Have an abortion and leave my family alone." It was my father's voice. I was terrified. I ran to my mother, who was still sleeping in her bed. I said, "I love you. Something terrible has happened. I love you so much." And she walked towards me, and she held my face. "I forgive you." And then she kissed my mouth... and moved close into my body... my father's body. And all I knew was that Papa wasn't leaving and that my mother was happy. That was very good, Sigrid. Very good, indeed. What will happen to that now? Oh, nothing. It'll stay here with me, and it'll be safe. - Are you sure? - I know it's been a long time. But, yes, it's okay. Thank you. Thank you. I'll go check upstairs. Okay, so I'm pretty sure she lives alone. Um, what happened to "we shouldn't take too much"? I'm just so hungry. I like the colors she's used in here. Wild daffodil. - What are you going on about? - Hmm... - It's just good to be home. - This isn't your house. Why not? We've got a bed, a bath, food in the fridge. Steinar won't recognize me. June, this is not a solution. Ah! Harry! That's deep. Ah. Does it hurt? Yep. Seriously, how are you doing this? It's like my fingers just know. Could you feel it coming this time? It's like a wave. Surges up. Sweeps everything away. Three times. There has to be a connection. I was frightened. When Steinar grabbed my arm, I was more frightened than I've ever been. And the club, the drugs, I thought I was losing my mind. And this time? It was the way you were talking. I thought you'd given up on me. - And then, the syringe... - Okay. - You were frightened? - Yeah. So, you reached out and you tried to stop her hand. You touched her? Skin to skin? Yeah. Okay. - That's good. - Hmm. It's a start. Wow. - That's, um... - What? It's neat. That felt like a kick. Oh, God. I'm really pregnant. How can the baby be with me and with Deborah? It can't be. - So, it's not real. - But it is. I know what I felt. You can see it. Feel. - I don't want to feel anything. - What, are you scared to touch me? Oh, God. You didn't mind when it was Lil. How can you say that? I did mind, June, because I only want you. - But, June, this isn't you! - Good. I don't want to be me anymore. I'm not even sure that I should exist. Look. That is you, yeah? June McDaniel. And you're not pregnant because we've never had sex. And if we had, it'd be our baby. And yes! Yes, I'd be shit-scared. But I'd know what to do and how to be with you. But, June, this? This has got nothing to do with us. So, you need to snap out of it right now! But I'm hidden. We're safe. We've got this house. Why can't we just stay here for a while? I don't understand. How can you want to be like this? Be someone else? June. I'm right here. Look at me. I can't do this. We need to get her alone this time. I always admired you, Steinar. In school... even if you roughed me up, we were always friends afterwards. But now... we're outside a house waiting to kidnap a 16-year-old girl who's not even there! Is anyone forcing you to do this? - If they've got something on you... - Shut it, now. Stop. I know it got bad when your parents died... You have no idea, Alf. You have no idea. I tried to end my life. - You tried to end your life? - Yes. Well... Why didn't you talk to me? I couldn't talk to someone... who knew me. There was one man. A doctor. I don't know how, but he saved me. He gave me something to live for. A new family. We're partners. Okay. So, why isn't he on this lunatic stakeout with you? Hmm? Huh? Why not? The girl is in there. Trust me. I trust my own eyes. And I saw the boy go in with a pregnant lady. This is... Chris? Hi, mate. Chris, you at home? What are you doing here? What is it? What's happened? John's at the Princess Victoria looking for them, while I'm here, going out of my damned mind. The Met will be doing their job. You know that better than anyone. - And as his mother... - I know. I know they wouldn't want me there. Doug... I'm not asking for anything. Just let me be your friend, Chris. Come on. Family first. For the first time since I was a girl, I feel like I can do anything. My life is finally about to begin. All your hard work has paid off. You'll be the next one to leave. No. I want to make a life here, a place I can feel safe. Somewhere my daughter can grow. You're going to stay... at Sanctum? Yes. But this is no life. Don't you want your own home? New friends? A lover? God, I've missed being touched. Those things have never brought me peace. I thought you liked it here. You've been so committed. To getting well, yes. To getting out of here. Runa has never left. But Runa is not a patient. She is a partner. Sanctum's her life. It's all she has. Maybe it's all she wants. Well, I want more. And so should you. June? In here. I think he looks like my uncle. Whose uncle? - What are you doing? - What do you think? We need our own food and then we need to leave. - I'm not taking money from her. - Right. Where do you think it's gonna come from? - 'Cause it's not just today. - Why are you acting like this? - Harry, stop it! - I'm not the one acting. I think you can come back if you wanted to. You're just not trying hard enough. I'll find a shop. Get ready. Steinar. Steinar! This is a mistake... - Stay away from me. - Shh. What's happening to me? Am I sick? How do I feel how Deborah feels? - I knew it! - Tell me how to stop it! Shh! Stand still! - Steinar! - Start the van. I've got the girl. She's pregnant! - You could hurt the baby! - It's the girl that's important! They found us! We need to go! - Harry! - Hey! Hey, call the police! Come on! Come on, June! Harry! - Stop! Stop! - Ow! Oh! Ooh! Who the hell are you? That's enough! Do you hear me?! Enough! Fuck this shit. Come on, come on. It's a dead end. Come on. Look, we have to get out of here. I can't run anymore. Deborah wants this so much. It took her so long. What? How do you know that? Something bad could happen. This baby can't be with us. I can't do it. I... I can't. Not more needles. No... I've already set up the nursery. I want the same color as the kitchen, wild daffodil. I'm not doing it by myself, Mum. I'm doing it without a man. I can't believe it's happening. I'm having a boy! June! June! Come on! Come on! June! Hey. Hey, look at me. You're scared for Deborah and the baby, but maybe that's not enough. But what if... What if you have to want to be yourself again? - But I don't. - I know you don't. I know. And I know you're frightened of yourself. But, June, I'm not frightened of who you are. Okay? So we're gonna let the both of them go. Together. I can't. - I can't do it. What if I hurt him? - You won't. You won't. Just breathe, okay? Your body will help you. Will you help me? Always! Always. Okay? Because you're my one, and I am yours. Okay? Look, June... Look, I'm sorry about before. Out of everyone I've ever met... I choose you, June McDaniel. I choose your eyes that are a perfect storm over a bright blue sea. I choose your freckle that you keep in the tuck of your elbow. The little finger that loops around mine when I take your hand. I choose your first letter. I choose your first reply. Even though I was scared to open it for three days. I choose your ink fingerprints that you left on it. And I love everything that you are. Okay? So, please... Please, just love those things, too. Shit! Open the door! I can see you. Keep going. I'm not a monster! I'm June McDaniel! June, June... Oh, my God. - Okay. - Okay. He's gone. The baby's gone. God, I hope they're safe. But we're not. Hey, come on. Come on! Send me that video of Deborah Hale. I don't care where it came from, I need it. Now. Hello? - It's me. - June! Are you okay? Where are you? I know you're both in London. I need to talk to Dad. - I need some answers. - All right. Okay, I'll put him on. No, no. We'll come meet you. - What... Where? - I'll let you know the place. Hey, come on. Wait! We've got one chance to get her home. So, whatever she wants, give her. Whatever she asks, just tell her the truth, okay? Right. - The Land Rover's parked outside. - We're hungry. Of course. What do you both want? Burger and chips. Come on. I'm not coming home. I'm not moving to Fair Isle. I'm gonna be myself. And Harry and I, we won't be separated. I see. - Why did Mom leave? - We've discussed this. Tell me again. There's a lot I want to tell you, June. Both of you. - When we get home. - No. Now. And you can tell me, too. I'm a part of this. No more lies. I'm sorry. This isn't the place. Pfft... I never wanted to leave you. You or Ryan. But John said I had to go. I... I didn't have a choice. The last thing I ever wanted to do was to hurt either of you. Where is she? Where did you get that? You tried to control her, too. When you couldn't, you made her leave. She left you. I stayed. I... I took care of you both. Your mother had demons. I did what I thought was best. Curfews! No friends, no life! Sedatives! It was a tiny, tiny dose, just to keep you calm. 'Cause you know what I am? What're you talking about? I've always thought of you as my daughter. You're both my kids, and I love you! I'm not lying to you. You've got these ideas about your mother, what she felt like, what she did. Well, you didn't know her like I did. She was sick. - And she hurt people and she used people. - It's not her fault. Whatever she said, whatever you think you need... Ryan, you were right. Dad lied. He's been lying this whole time, 'cause Mom and I, we're not sick. But we're different. And I'm gonna find her. Your mother will never be able to love you like you need her to. And you think you can be this knight in shining armor and save the day. Well, guess what? You can't. You can love her, but it'll never be enough. June? What's wrong with her? - June? - Hey, don't touch her! Go. Go! - You... - June! What a great honor it is to be surrounded and supported by such extraordinary women. And, Sigrid, your hard work is truly inspiring, a great source of pride. And your success today really is a triumph for all of us. Ben, Runa, I'll never be able to thank you enough. - You're all truly my second family. - We'll miss you, Sigi. - Skål. Mm-hmm. - Skål. There'll be a lot to get organized. We won't send you out there unprepared. And, in time, Elena and June will follow in your footsteps. Oh, Elena is not going anywhere. What do you mean? Elena? Um, Dr. Halvorson said I could stay here with June. - Is that so? - Well, of course. There are no time limits. Come on, this is meant to be a celebration. Sanctum is... is not a place to raise a girl. Oh! Oh, dear. I've been stupid. Your new family, your future here... - I'm not a part of it, am I? - Runa, please. This is about... What are you talking about? - Runa is not well. - English, please. It's so obvious. You've invested everything in this girl. - We want June to be safe. - Yes. - Don't patronize me. - Runa. Ben and I saved you when you were lost. You had nothing. Everything was shit! You! You stay the hell away from me. - Runa... - Fuck! Chris, what the hell are you doing? I told you, the Pennines Five is finished. There. It was Harry at the Princess Victoria. - I saw him on CCTV. - Is he hurt? And then, I thought he was with June McDaniel. The hospital sent this over. It happened today. She fell into a coma this morning. Doug, it's like Lewis and the others. It's happening again. Chris, This isn't our jurisdiction. You've got to let people do their job. How can I, when we didn't do ours? Vibrating eyes? The only other time I've seen them is with the Pennines Five. Doug... Something's happening! And Harry's right in the middle of it! You are jeopardizing our work in the most fundamental way! When did you stop seeing me, Ben? Elena's still young enough to give you everything. Is that it? You're losing your grip. You're doing nothing to help. - We don't even share a bed anymore! - You think that's my choice? I think I'm a puzzle that you have solved. And now, there are new challenges. You've never been a jealous woman before. - I never thought you'd betray me. - And I never will! Oh... You really must get this anger under control. You know where it leads. This is why we can't share a bed. That's the reason... is it? - You know it's not safe. - I only know what you tell me. Just like the therapy. How do I know what you're doing? What I'm doing is trying to give two women their lives back. It's always about Elena! And Sigrid, and now June! What about me? Your real family! Do you even remember me? Runa, please, stop it. - Uh... - Runa. Runa. Use your mantra. Use your mantra. - I don't remember. - Runa Gundersen. Fifty-six. Born in Levanger. Light-haired baby. Steps to green door. Runa? - No, I don't want to! - I don't want to do this. I don't want to listen! I... There, there, my love. Easy does it... I've got you. I've got you. I've got you. Your brother's a good guy. Yeah. He is. - You okay? - Yeah. - I'll just give you some space. - No, wait. Stay. I want you to... see me. And now you. - What? - It's just... I've been thinking about this. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What happens next? - I don't know. I couldn't imagine what... it would be like. I... I thought we'd have to... hide. I thought we wouldn't have any time. We've got all the time in the world now. No rushing, then. That's right. No rushing. It's all right. I'm not scared. I haven't... you know... before.
