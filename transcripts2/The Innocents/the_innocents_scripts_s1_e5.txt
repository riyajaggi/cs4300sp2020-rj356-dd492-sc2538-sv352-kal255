 Just breathe, Elena. I remember Ryan running down the path chasing butterflies. Like he was catching snowflakes. Now, embrace the memory. Don't back away from it, but bring your mind into the present, into this room, here with me. Everything is perfectly safe. Love is your trigger, remember. Memories make us who we are. Happiness. Pride. Sadness. I mean, we all feel them, don't we?

 Doesn't matter who you are or what you say, what you do. I mean, even you and me. There's emotion in the room, right? I can feel it. I know love. I know I'm young, but... I know love. I'm in love. And I used to write these letters, love letters. I found it really easy to put down on paper how I felt and... mean every word. Now, I know I'll be a great addition to your sales team. "Emotions for every occasion"? I'm your man. You haven't been out in London. This is your first night. We are going out. You, me, and June. June?

 Some of us are going out tonight. You guys should come with. Uh, I would love to, I really would, but... we are so broke, honestly. Plus, Harry's had a job interview today, so I think we're just gonna be... - celebrating, just the two of us, later. - Okay. Thanks, though. Oh, my God. Wait. So my friends and I are pretty split on this. - Are they twins or CGI? - Show me. - Uh, wait, wait. Three, two, one. - Look, look, look. Whoa! Whoa! That is crazy! Play it again. Play it again. Play it again. That's insane! - Must be CGI. There's two of them. - No, they're twins! Well, there's no way - that can be real. How is that possible? - Don't you see that? - Oh, my God! - That is insane! No way. - You all right? - Yeah. You all right? Yep. I'm feeling great! - Hey. - Hey. I've got a good feeling about this one. Hey. Hey, what's wrong? What happened? Look. Nobody's gonna believe this is real. It's the Internet, yeah? Look, there's weirder stuff out there than... than that, right? Harry, look. "I know what this is. I can help." "Passionate Amateur"? "What do you know? How can you help?" June... "National Portrait Gallery, room 11, 5:00 p.m." - What were you doing, sweetheart? - Will you take me, too? - I've been looking for you, John. - Yeah? You haven't answered my calls. What the hell happened in London? Nothing. I couldn't find them. - Do you mind? I have to go. - Is that alcohol I can smell on you? - What? - I think it is. I think you shouldn't be driving. Why don't you come with me? - Or I could arrest you in public. - This is ridiculous. Let's go. Now. Listen, I know you're hopeful, but this could be anyone. - Yeah, it could be Steinar. - Exactly. So if you see him, don't run, okay? Just stay in plain sight in the crowd. He won't be able to try anything there. Yeah. Yeah, okay. When this portrait was first exhibited at Whitehall Palace in 1951... it created a sensation. The warping of the king's face was shocking... subversive... unlike anything the English public had seen before. But... when you view the painting through this viewfinder... you'll see that... Edward VI isn't the fun house freak he appears to be. He's just like you and me. - Excuse me. Could we join the tour? - Oh, I don't work here. I'm just a passionate amateur. - Who are you? - Francis Walsingham. Famous spymaster to Queen Elizabeth I. Even this painting has its secrets. There's a second face under Walsingham's. If you look very closely... you can see her. Boo. That's her. So we meet again. I'm Kam. How did you do that so easily? Well, I shift whenever I want. - So that's what it's called, a... a shift? - Yeah. - So when did it happen for the first time? - About a week ago. You must be reeling, both of you. Where are you staying? In a hostel. But it's not safe. Do you know anyone else in London? Well, I can see that you're scared and, believe me, I was scared, too. And I know what it's like, not knowing who to trust. So... if you need somewhere to stay, just for a few days, and a bit of a... crash course in how to handle yourself, then... I'm prepared to do that. So how do we know we can trust you? Meeting new people hasn't exactly worked out for us so far. Me neither. This is a big risk for me, too, so... it's up to you. If you prefer... I could just walk away, and we never see each other again. Or... Here is my address. I'm so glad that I met you. See ya. I've got all the time in the world. So I'm gonna ask you again. Where was Elena on the night of the Pennines Five? I can't for the life of me see why you're bringing this up. We had a fight, she took her bag, disappeared. - And she didn't come back. - You know all this. We picked up your Land Rover on CCTV, remember? Near the canal, where two of the victims were found. - Out looking for her, wasn't I? - I can tell you where she was. In fact, I can show you. She was in the same place as Lewis in the last moments of his life as he knew it. There. I don't know what you're pointing at. You're telling me that's not Elena in Lewis's reflection? I need a word. - Not now, Doug. I'm busy. - My office, now. - I'm in the middle... - Now! - What do you think you're playing at? - Listen... The custody sergeant said you didn't even breathalyze him. That you wouldn't let anyone sit in. You cannot abuse your position this way! Whatever's going on between you and John... - He knows something. - About Harry? About Lewis. The Pennines Five. - You've got to be kidding me. - You saw what happened to that nurse. And that clip, it brought it all back. Gave me bloody nightmares, again. But this is out of our jurisdiction now! If you keep behaving like this, I can't protect you anymore. Sometimes I think you don't even want to find out what happened to Lewis. Christine... I am sorry to do this, but you have had a warning, and now you need to step back. No, you don't understand. I think we missed something. Detective Inspector Polk, I am suspending you indefinitely. What? - At least let me finish interviewing him. - I'm letting John go. You've got nothing on him. Go home, Christine. Now! Hey. Let's not tell her too much, okay? The attack. Especially the stuff about your mum. Let's keep that between ourselves. Yeah, okay. I just can't believe I've found someone like me. She's still a stranger. - Hey, guys. Come on in. Come on. - Hey. - Andrew? - Yes? - They're here. - All right. Andrew, this is... - June. - June. - And Harry. - Harry. I... - believe you've already met me, yeah? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Nice to meet you. - Come on, I'll show you your room. Like food? - Um, yeah. Yeah. - Come help me cook. - Berserkers? - Mm-hmm. It's Old Norse for "bear shirts." They were warriors who went into battle naked, except for bloodied animal skins. I wonder what it would have looked like to see them on a brow of a hill surrounding your village. God, I bet they were beautiful. It says the berserkers were forces of complete annihilation. Yeah, with voracious sexual appetites. Makes your run-of-the-mill Vikings look like Cub Scouts. Look at this. "The condition began with shaking, a chattering of the teeth, and then the face and body convulsed and changed." - Changed into what? - Bears. Wolves. The animals of the skins that they wore. These crazy bastards were shifting in the ninth century. The gene passed down from father to son. Yeah, but all this is just legend, though, isn't it? Well, it's not really about the boys anymore, is it? It only seems to affect women. Food is ready. Come on, let's eat. - It's amazing. No... No pain, no fear. - And then they went berserk. You don't get it. I mean, this... This could be where it all started. You know, all that anger, that... that fight or flight. You know, the berserkers, they... they turned into animals so that they could do anything to anyone. God, and Kam, she just knows so much about... everything. Okay. So, what did you tell her? Mm... Nothing she didn't know already. And what did you think of Andrew? Yeah, yeah. He seems like a pretty good guy. Although it's very weird wearing his pajamas. Hey, what's going on? Where've you been? Sit down. I have to tell you something... before you hear it from someone else. It's about June... and your mother. Memories... of me and Mum... traveling together before we came here. Sometimes she'd be gone for days at a time... and then these strangers would be looking after me. Except they weren't strangers. They knew me. Really knew me. I thought they were dreams. But they were all her, weren't they? They were all Mum. You know, the night she left... I saw things. - Weird things. - Why didn't you tell me? Honestly? Because... I needed to hate you. I needed you to be lying. I needed you to have driven Mum away. I didn't want to believe that she had a choice. She didn't. I should have told you sooner, both of you, but I didn't know how to. - Or whether June was even the same as her. - You know, I thought I was crazy. After she left that night, I thought, "Stay safe, and stay at home." I ended up exactly like her. Locked myself away in that annex... - like a prisoner. - That's not what I wanted for you, ever. You know, I understand what you were trying to do for June now. Fair Isle... routine, isolation... You cared and Mum didn't. She ruined people's lives, and she just ran away! No, she loved you. She loved you both. But your mother was different, and... And I couldn't help her... or June. I let you all down. And I'm sorry. She just upped and left? So, how long has it been since you last saw her? Three years. She's your mother. I don't know how she could do that to you. No, it's not like that, honestly. She's a good person. She left you. Yeah, but she's... She's trying to find me. She wants us to... She wants us to be together. It doesn't sound like it. Look. June... my girl. You're about to turn 16. I want to be there to help you understand the things you might be feeling. Things that... might be happening to you. - She sent that to you? - Yeah. Aren't you angry? No, I just... I think I just want to see her. Are you sure about that? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So it says that, four months ago, a nun was found in a coma in her convent in Hordaland, Norway. Vibrating eyes, no signs of injury, and she recovered spontaneously with no memory of events. Police were concerned for the well-being of another nun that went missing on the same day. - So you can read this? - I told you, I'm an enthusiast. I collect this stuff. Any signs that there are... any more of us out there. That's her. That's my mum. I know. Even though it's not the clearest photo, I recognized her from your video. - But that's not her name, though. - Well, it wouldn't be, if she was in hiding. She's like us. Morning. Thanks. Hey. Hey. What's happening? I was... I was just telling June that... I think that we found each other for a reason. Ah. Right. You know, yesterday at the gallery, you... shifted. You did it on your own, and you weren't scared. How? How did you do that? Do you want me to show you both? Steinar, is that you? I... I messed up. Ben, listen to me. June's not like the other women at Sanctum. She can get into your mind... your memories. She's everything you're looking for. Where is she? I... I don't know. Somewhere in London. She has my phone. Listen, you stay where you are. Stay exactly where you are, and I will call you. Okay. The best place to start is with your trigger. What were you feeling before you shifted? Fear, mostly. Mine's pain. But that's what it's all about. Understanding the emotion behind the shift. After that, there's really nothing to be afraid of. Hey... Listen to me, June. We are unique creatures. Don't ever be ashamed of what you are. You have to embrace it. Oh, and, uh, you'll be wearing the same clothes, so think ahead. Ready? See how easy it can be... if you have complete trust? I don't know. It just... It just felt like she was just... - using him. - What? No. No, this is something that they do together. And they're not scared of it. They can control it. - It's not hurting anyone. - She... She burned herself trying to make it happen. - You did see that, right? - Look, you said so yourself, we need to find out what's happening to me, and... Kam... I... I don't know. She might be my best chance, my... my only chance, to find that out. Look, she's gonna help me find my mum, Harry. Okay. Okay, so... So we ask her to help you. Really help you. And then we leave. Yeah, okay. Just promise me you'll never do that to me. I would never do anything you didn't want me to do. Ever. What are you doing? Just getting things in order. I am going to London. For her? There's some complications with Steinar, so I have to bring June here myself. Are you going to leave us now, when I need you here more than ever? I hit shift state for the first time in years. Yes, and the girls mustn't know. - I could be dangerous. You know I could. - No. If you take care of yourself and you keep calm, you'll be all right. I'll be gone for two days at the most. - Two days? - Mm-hmm. - Don't leave me. - The last thing I want to do is leave you, but we may not get another chance to help June and put things right. Oh... Okay. Just promise me you'll wake me before you go. But Papa hadn't chosen us. He was packed and ready to leave. It doesn't mean that I love you any less. It doesn't mean that I love you any less. It doesn't mean that I love you any less. - You're leaving. - Yes, just for a few days. June's ready to come here, and she needs my help. Um, but I'm supposed to be leaving. There is still so much to organize. Do I stay in Norway? I don't have any money. How do I get a job? I don't even have a place to stay. All exciting challenges to face, hmm? Yes. - Exciting. - This is what we've been working towards. Obviously, I can't be here all the time, but that does not mean I love you any less. Maybe I... I wait until you come back. Like I said, there is still so much to organize, and it's not like I have to leave tomorrow, is it? Of course not. Not at all. Then, I'll stay. - Look after Runa while you're away. - You would do that for me? Of course. Good.

Shots? - Ready for anything tonight? - Ready for anything. And on that note, you're coming with me. Okay. Girls only, just for now. Here. I had it set up. Car... a flat. I was gonna get a job. I thought I had it all taken care of. I thought that this was the start of everything. And then... Do you actually enjoy it? Being in someone else's body, you know, another... another girl or man? Why do you ask? When I shift, I... I feel things. I know things about them. Impossible things. I can get in their minds, their memories. Yes. This thing that we can do, no other shifter can do it. We feel it. We're not just in their bodies, we're in their head, too. You and me, we're special. So... What do you want to feel now? Hey, thanks again for letting us stay. Nah. You know it's not permanent. Yeah. No, yeah, of course. I'm not trying to get rid of you. But see, the thing is, Harry... once you're in Kam's orbit... I mean, don't get me wrong, it's... it's amazing, but... the rest of the world kind of... disappears. I remember being like June. Totally enthralled. I'd never met anyone like her. What are they up to, anyway? Who knows? They could be anywhere. Could be anybody. Eh? They'll come find us when they're ready. That's how it works.

Hello, June? - Who is this? - This is Ben Halvorson. - I'm so glad... - Is my mum with you? She is, and she's safe. Would you like to talk to her? Yes. Elena. Elena. I've got June on the phone. Will you talk to her? - No, I can't. - Yes, you can. She's your daughter. - No, I can't. You know what will happen. - This is your chance. If you talk to her, I can bring her here. - June? - Mum! Are you okay? Where... Where are you? I'm in Norway. I'm in a safe place, a good place. It's called Sanctum. June... You're the same as me, aren't you? If you come here... we can help you. I can help you. We can be together. Do you want that? Yes. Okay. The man you just spoke to, he's a doctor. You can trust him. He's coming to London to get you, to bring you here. Just keep your phone. Stay where you are. And don't tell anyone. Okay. And, June... I love you... - You all right? - June, come and join us! Very good. Now, remember your mantra. Elena Askelaand, 39 years old. Born south of Bergen. Pierced ears with Girl Guide badge... No, no, no. Do you remember? You remember that story? - No. - You slapped him in the face! This massive guy came over. Massive, seven-foot, and was like... - Music! - "Ooh! Slap me in the face, please!" Music's on. It's coming, it's coming. - Get us a drink, babe. - Okay. Am I doing everything? - Yeah. - Music, drink, even do the drugs. - June! - The paraphernalia! ♪ Baby, I'm a pleaser ♪ ♪ I go out my way to treat you ♪ ♪ But I can't be a teacher ♪ ♪ 'Cause I'm a problem with problems ♪ ♪ I know who I am ♪ Ah, it's good stuff, mate. ♪ Baby ♪ ♪ Some people are meant to be loved... ♪ - Here you go, babe. - Can I talk to you?

This isn't funny. Please, get out of him. You should see what he really thinks. He got what he wanted out of your body, and, um... I hate to tell you this, but... he thought you'd be better. It won't last. Trust me. I can feel it. You're a liar. You don't feel anything. Harry? Harry? Harry! Harry? Come on. Harry, wake up! Come on. Come on. - He'll be fine. - Why are you doing this? Harry... Harry, please, wake up. - Stop this, Kam. - Harry, come on. Oh, what? Am I in trouble again? Let him go. - Now! - Wake up. Fine. Hey. Look at me. Look at me! Are you okay? Wait, what's happening? - What's happening? - Come on. What happened? We need to leave. Harry, wait. I... I left my phone. We have to go back. No. Forget it. It doesn't matter. Come on. Let's just go. No. Hey, wait. You don't understand. Look, I... I spoke to my mum last night. She said to stay in London, and that someone's gonna come and get me, a... a doctor. Are you kidding me? What? No. I... This is my chance to stop this. No. No, no, no, this is... this is too much for us. Kidnappers... a crazy woman, and now, what, some... some doctor? No. No, I've had enough. We're not doing it anymore. Neither are you. - Come on, let's just go. - Hey! Harry, stop! No! Come on! Come on, let's just go! I just spoke to my mother for the first time in three years. If I want to see her, it's got nothing to do with you. Nothing to do with me? I'm the only one who's stuck by you. What happened back there? - I don't know. - No, you do know. I'm not stupid. Someone shifted into me. That shouldn't have happened. Was it you? June, just please tell me. Was it you? I don't even know who you are anymore. No, but you know what I am, don't you? So go. Go home.
