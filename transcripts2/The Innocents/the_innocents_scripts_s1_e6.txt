 No apology. Nothing. Why are you so pissed? It's not like I screwed him. Why? You know why! It is the one thing I ask for, Kam. Only use my body, and you couldn't even give me that. Please. Most men would die for what you get. What do I get? Dumped in the cupboard, seeing stuff I never did on a phone? What do I actually get? Do you want to go, then? No. No.

 Baby... I'm starting to forget who I am. I know who you are. I see everything, don't I? No one could know you like I do... from the inside. Everything you've seen, everything you've felt. The thing is, Andrew, it's so predictable. Standard. So replaceable. So, I think you should go... baby. Just before this gets boring. Fuck you, Kam.

 Dad? Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad! Hey, Dad. Dad, I'm back. - Ah... - It's Harry. Your son. Dad, I've missed you so much. Oh, my God. Harry! Oh. I've missed you so much. - What's this? - New clothes. I prefer my own. I'm gonna need my phone, too, so will you give it to me, please? I need a coffee. Do you want one? No, I want my phone. You know... I've been where you are. In free fall. No idea what you are. Well, guess what? You're me. I'm nothing like you. I would never shift into someone on purpose. I would never try and split people up. Oh, so he's gone, has he? You always have to push them away in the end, always. Like your mother did to you. I'm gonna find a way to be with him. And her. Look, can we just hurry thisup? 'Cause I've gotta go meet someone who can actually help me. You know, I keep wondering... what it would be like to shift into you. You're still so... unspoiled. I could stay as you forever. You don't scare me, Kam. I can't stand you. I think everything you do is a lie, a front. Even the way you shift is messed up. Look at what you've done to yourself. Give me the phone. Fine. I'll find it myself. June. Listen, I know I haven't been that straight with you. There is a reason. And I know you're just trying to find a way to understand all this, but... maybe you've already found it. I could... help you. We could do it together. Like sisters. That would never work, Kam. Well... I think it could. Not after what you did to Harry. To me. I need someone I can trust. Please. Don't leave me. I'm sorry. Good morning, girls. - What is it, Runa? - That dress was put away. Uh... - It was in the linen box. - At the bottom. Wrapped up. And it was not yours to take, either way. June is coming soon, and you still haven't made her dress. I had to find something. Why not this one? It is the wrong color. - Does it really matter? - Yes, it matters! She will be treated no differently from the rest of us. I meant no harm, Runa. I'm just being a mother. What is this? I think you know what it is. The Pennines Five? You're still working on it, after all this time? Mum, why is June there? You tell me. I know about the nurse in London, collapsing into a coma, her eyes... vibrating like that. The doctor had never seen anything like it, but I have... on your dad, Harry. What did June do to that nurse? She was there, wasn't she? Her mother, Elena Askelaand, was there when your dad collapsed. - No, you don't know that. - I do. You need to see this. No, Mum. Look, please just stop this. Elena was there the night it happened. Look. I don't know why the reflection is like this, but she was. And this. I can see June's face here. How can that be? And how can you be with this nurse when she was unconscious on a bed at this precise time? I don't understand how, but... Elena hurt your dad. And her daughter is just as dangerous. - Where are you going? - Stay out of this! So, what are you gonna do? Run away again? John! - John! - Hey! Harry? What are you doing here? - John's not here. - Well, where is he? Where's my sister? Oi! John! I don't care! What do you mean, you don't care? You left her in London? You haven't, have you? John! So what if I have? Really? You know I can't fight you. You can if you want, mate. But I wouldn't. Harry. You're a mess. Did she know? Did you know her mum hurt my dad? No. No. Neither of us did. Just... why my dad? I don't know. You know what she is. What they both are. I need to know more than that. Everything. John needs to talk. Well, he's not good either. Don't think he even came back last night. Well, I need answers. Harry, wait up. I'm coming with you. Alcohol? Runa, really? It is so forbidden. - And you, Runa... - Yes, yes. Stop it, Sigi. Ben has only just left. Has it really come to this? If there is a problem, maybe I can help... if you feel like sharing. Maybe we all should do some sharing. Flight VNO404 from Bergen will be delayed. Please wait for further announcements. Hello, old friend. Hey! I see you've been celebrating my arrival. - I'm sorry. - Oh, no need to apologize. Feel like a coffee? Yeah. So how was your journey? Okay. Well, I... I know. Again, I... instead of bringing the girl, I... I scared her. I lost her, like before. But no harm is done. To... To make up for it, to show my... commitment... and care... I'm giving you my house. My family's home, for Sanctum, forever. No payment needed. - What's this? - That's a check. Full payment for your house. I can't take your offer, as generous as it is. And I'm sorry to say... I need to relieve you of your services. What does that mean? It means you can't come back to Sanctum. Ever. - Sanctum is home. It's my home. - Not just your home. How can I have you and the girl or any of the women together now? Hmm? You've proven yourself unsafe. You're even drinking again. That is not my fault. The way I am? - You know that. You know why. - We must take responsibility for what we are. That's always what the work was about, and you were a big part of that. - But it's time to move on. - Move on? Where? How? I'm sure you'll make a good choice. I must go to the girl. B... Ben... I want to thank you... - Please don't. - ... for everything. I mean that. Ben... Hopefully, John will be in here. Harry, you're back! You knob. Come here. - Still in love? - Of course he is. Get off. - Come on, man. - A pint? - Yeah. Let's get you a drink. - Pint? - All right. - I thought she was the one, man. - Who's buying him his drink? - I'll get it. What you want? - Hello, what can I get you? - A... pint, please. Get off. Mate... tell us you dumped her. Mm-hmm. Yep. Finally! - Have you seen her dad today? - No. Does he want to shoot you? Something like that. So come on, then. What's been going on here? Nothing, obviously. Except Dean thinks you're some secret gangster now or something. Some freaky man you're meant to know scared the shit out of him. Threatened his kid and that. Weird, man. - Hi, uh, can I have a tea, please? - Yeah, of course. Here you go, love. Thank you. Three, two, one! - Done, done. - Yeah, yeah. You don't remember me, Ryan, do you? Uh... Sam. I went to school with you. Oh. Oh, right. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Uh... - You didn't look at me then, either. You know, I could never tell if you were shy or just very stuck-up. But I was looking at you. You have to drink. Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Not here, Harry. - Why should he hide after what he did? - Come on, son. - Outside, eh? - "Son"? Only one man can call me son, and he's gone. You see, my dad was kind, he was caring, and Elena wrecked him! And you let her. Didn't you, John? Look around, John. Everyone's looking at you 'cause you're a coward. Come on, why don't we tell everyone what Elena did that night? Huh? 'Cause it wasn't just my dad that got hurt, was it? - Seriously, Harry, not here! - Sorry, Ryan, but shut up! Okay, let's talk. Let's start with where the hell is June? You've known the truth about my dad. You looked me in the face and didn't say a word, you wanker. You looked in my face knowing you were about to steal my daughter. Shut up! Stop twisting it! - This is about my dad! - How many have you had? You're not making any sense, Harry. - Listen... - No, no! - Not here! - No, no! - Not now! - Harry, not here. - Come on, John! - Take him home! Big man like you, John, huh? Come on! Come outside! Where is she? She wanted to stay in London. Well? What you gonna do? Since when did you go to the pub? Since I had to start dealing with this mess, and you weren't there. What you gonna do? Nothing this time, Ryan. 'Cause it's always the wrong thing. Right. Well, let's just all give up then, shall we? I feel so wicked. Yeah, I know! He's only been gone a day, and look at us. I think it's healthy for us... to share a little moment like this. There's been some tension. Yes. Ooh. Thank you. Thank you. I propose a toast. To the mysterious brewer of Sanctum. - Skol. - Skol! Skol. Mm. Now we know why she would never let us - feed the chickens. - Mm-hmm. I guess we all have our little secrets. Well, if you have any more secrets like this, Runa, let me know. I have a secret. It's a sad one... ... but it's still exciting. There was this girl... back home. Well, she's a woman now. But I still think of her. I think about going and telling her. And I think I will... soon. I don't even care what she says back. It's just... I think I'm ready now. To love. I never loved the man I raised my children with. John. Isn't that an awful thing to say? I chose him as he was safe, for them. Uh... The questions my daughter might bring with her... scare me to death. If we are baring souls, maybe you already know. But I'm not able to hide it anymore. I'm ill. I have, uh... early dementia. Unfortunately, that also runs in my family. I saw it take my mother. I... know what is coming. I know. No, no. Okay, okay. Trust my touch. I'm strong now. But I am not. I can't control it, Sigrid. - Runa, I am so, so sorry. - Ah, don't be, please. I may cry, I don't want to spend my time crying. I want to spend it just... just... being myself. While I can. Mm. Okay. Come on. Sigi? Yes, come on! Are... Are you crazy? Elena? A swim? That's not very wise. We are a bit tipsy. Sigrid, you are crazy. Why? Come on, girls! Come on! It's okay. I'm here. Don't worry. Tell me it's gonna be okay. I'm not going anywhere. No, but you know what I am, don't you? No! I've been where you are. In free fall. No idea what you are. - Well, guess what? - It's me! - You're me. - June. You all right, love? If you come here, I can help you. We can be together. Do you want that? June? June? June, it's Dr. Halvorson. I'm in London. June. Why is this happening to me? Shall we sit down? I feel better now. You should've trusted me like I trusted you. I feel better now. I'm better now. I'm better now. You should've trusted me like I trusted you. You should trust me... like I trusted you. You carry a mutated gene from a very particular Scandinavian bloodline. What I've ascertained is that it only passes down through the female line. It seems to skip a generation. So, mother to daughter is unusual, which makes you a little special. Is there a cure? Not as yet, but we are making very good progress. "We"? So there's... there's more of us? There's Sigrid and Runa. And of course, your mother. We've gone on to make... somewhat of an unusual family and a safe place for all of us. How do I know it's gonna be safe for me? Do you feel safe out here? Do others feel safe around you? Do you think I'm a monster? No. You're a young woman in a... in a frightening new world, and I think you just need someone to walk through it with you. I just need you to trust me. - Yeah, okay. - Good. I'll come. You. Where have you been all this time? No. Wait! I've never seen this side of her. She's opening like a flower. It means a lot to see it is working. I'm sorry. I've been selfish, um... caught up in my own things. Perhaps, in truth... I'm a little jealous. To see my partner so focused on you and your child. You see... you are wrong, Elena. I am a mother, too. But I lost her, and I don't want her forgotten. Runa. I'm sorry. No. We can't. It's okay. You can. Thank you for telling me. I promise, I'll never forget. What was her name? Her name was Freya. - Freya. - Yes. Thanks. Why did you think I wouldn't care if you went? I wouldn't miss you? 'Cause you didn't. You were never around. And... after Dad... changed... I felt like I lost you both. It was so hard. Seeing him in that state, I just... I couldn't accept it. But, Mum, you still can't. You're home now, with your family. Yeah. Promise me one thing. You'll never go near that girl again. I promise. It's time to get your dad up. I'll do it. And when you're ready, we can talk. - Hello? - It's Kam. Don't hang up. - What do you want? - Look, June's in trouble. She's leaving for Norway with this man, Halvorson. You've gotta stop her from going. You gotta make her listen. Is this some kind of wind-up? Harry, he's dangerous. He acts like he's not, but he is. I know him. And this place is not what it seems. Harry, are you listening? I know how much you love each other, Harry. Look, I saw the night you spent together when I shifted into you. What? She looked at you and she said... "I want you to see me." And you couldn't take your eyes off her. Haven't been able to stop thinking about it. 'Cause... I don't really know how to feel like that about someone anymore. It's an island near Holen Fjord. He calls it Sanctum. Don't let her go. Leave your message after the tone. June, it's me. Call me. Please. It's urgent. - Princess Victoria Hospital. - Hi, um, I was there the other night when one of your nurses collapsed. Deborah. Um... Can you... Can you just tell me how she is? Sorry, love. We can't discuss patients. Well, please, can you just... Can you tell me if she's still... pregnant? Is her baby okay? The baby is fine, and so is she. Here we are. - Thank you. - We don't really allow phones at Sanctum. It's for our own protection. Can't be too careful. Uh... Okay. Flight VNO405 to Bergen is now ready for boarding. Come on, dear. It's not far now. It's so far away, Mama. From everything. Mama. Yes, it is far away. But we are safe here. At last. Remember? Come. Freya.
