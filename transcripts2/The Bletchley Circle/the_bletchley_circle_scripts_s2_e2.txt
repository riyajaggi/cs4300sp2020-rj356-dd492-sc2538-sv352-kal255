 The Bletchley Circle (2012â€“2014): Season 2, Episode 2 - Blood on Their Hands: Part 2 - full transcript 
 Alice is to hang, though she tells her friends she assumed Lizzie had killed John and so taken the blame. The women though know that John was killed and the attempt made on Lizzie's life to prevent them revealing what happened on Salisbury Plain and fell that they too are under surveillance. Discovering that the injured soldiers - all clearly guinea pigs as none had families - were treated at the same military hospital as Timothy had been, a reluctant Susan visits, claiming she needs his medical records for his overseas posting. She locates a horribly injured young soldier who confirms that he and other victims were deliberately chosen for the heartless experiment but Susan is removed by the military and forced to explain to her husband her past at Bletchley and her current mission. Meanwhile Millie, Jean and Lucy learn that John was employed at Porton Down, a government establishment testing chemical weaponry run by Professor Masters, whom they visit. He is a deranged patriot who believed John and Lizzie were Russian spies and the trio are in danger from him unless Susan can prevail upon the honest colonel at the hospital to help them and save Alice.

 AH. BECAUSE SHE'S STILL DANGEROUS TO THEM. THEY'RE AFTER HER BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT RICHARDS TOLD HER, AND THEY DAREN'T TAKE THE RISK THAT SHE MIGHT KNOW WHATEVER IT WAS THAT RICHARDS KNEW. IT'S IN THESE CLIPPINGS SOMEWHERE. SOMETHING MAKES THAT STORY WORTH KILLING FOR. SORRY. I COULDN'T GET AWAY. ANYTHING ABOUT THE SALISBURY CRASH? THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CASE FILE, APART FROM A NOTE SAYING, PLEASE REFER ALL INFORMATION TO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE.

 OFFICIAL SECRETS. AND TO THINK IT USED TO BE OUR JOB TO PROTECT THEM. NOT ANYMORE. BUT SURELY THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT THE ARMY WOULD WANT TO PUBLICIZE IF THEY HAD A CHOICE? GO ON. WELL, I JUST THINK THEY DID HAVE A CHOICE. IT HAPPENED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE ON SALISBURY PLAIN. ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED WERE MILITARY PERSONNEL. THEY COULD HAVE KEPT THIS AS QUIET AS THEY LIKED, AND YET, RICHARDS WAS READING ABOUT IT IN HIS DAILY NEWSPAPER. YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT IS ODD. THE FAMILIES OF THESE SERVICEMEN MUST'VE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. HMM, YES, GOOD. WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHO THE FAMILIES ARE. IF WE CAN GET TO THEM, MAYBE WE'LL FIND OUT THE TRUTH. Susan: I HAVE TO PICK THE CHILDREN UP FROM SCHOOL. THE GERMAN BUSINESS WORLD WOULD CRUMBLE WITHOUT ME. I'VE GOT TO GET TO WORK. I'M SORRY. YOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED. WHAT? THE TRANSLATION POST HAS BEEN REASSIGNED. YOUR SERVICES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED HERE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY? I CAN'T GO INTO DETAILS. WHY? I BELIEVE SOME QUERY AS TO YOUR SECURITY CLEARANCE. I'M SORRY. SAM? SAM! SAM! SAM! LOOK AT THE DOG. YES. MUMMY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES, YES OF COURSE, DARLING. COME ON. SHALL WE GO HOME? [FOOTSTEPS] [DOOR SHUTS] LIZZIE? IT'S ME. [KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK] FORGOT MY KEYS. SORRY. AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE AT WORK? APPARENTLY NOT. HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I DON'T KNOW. HOW SHOULD I BE FEELING? I'LL GO AND MAKE US SOME TEA. THESE SHOULD LEAD US TO THE FAMILIES. I HOPE YOU LADIES ARE IN THE MOOD FOR A LITTLE LIGHT READING. MUMMY? YES? IF DADDY GOES ABROAD, DOES THAT MEAN SAM AND I? COME, TOO, OR DOES IT MEAN BOARDING SCHOOL? WHO TOLD YOU DADDY'S GOING ABROAD? I HEARD YOU TALKING. COME HERE. NOTHING'S DECIDED YET. BUT IF? I DON'T WANT YOU WORRYING ABOUT IT. I DON'T WANT TO GO TO BOARDING SCHOOL. [TELEPHONE RINGING] HELLO? WELL, THIS IS EITHER VERY IMPORTANT, OR IT'S THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COINCIDENCE. WHAT IS IT? [STATIC POP] YOU KNOW WE WERE GONNA TALK TO THE FAMILIES, ASK THEM ABOUT-- JEAN, DID YOU HEAR SOMETHING? LIKE WHAT? [STATIC POP] IT'S NOTHING. DON'T WORRY ABOUT TALKING TO THE FAMILIES. IT'S ONLY DINNER. I'M SURE THEY CAN ALL MAKE IT. I HAVE TO GO, I'M SORRY. I'LL--I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. BYE NOW. MUMMY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YES! WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S GOING ON? NOTHING, DEAR. Millie: YOU SURE IT WASN'T JUST A NOISE? TELEPHONES DO MAKE NOISES, YOU KNOW OF COURSE IT WASN'T JUST A NOISE. LOOK. WHOEVER KILLED RICHARDS THOUGHT A MILITARY COURT WAS THE BEST WAY TO KEEP LIZZIE'S TRIAL UNDER THEIR CONTROL. THE KILLER IS IN THE ARMY OR THE GOVERNMENT. I, UH--I LOST MY JOB. SOMEONE'S ALTERED MY SECURITY CLEARANCE, SO I CAN'T GET GOVERNMENTAL TRANSLATION WORK ANYMORE. DO YOU SEE? SOMEBODY KNOWS ABOUT US. AND THE POLICE HAVE A FILE SAYING, REFER TO THE MINISTRY OF DEFENSE. SAY WE GO TO THE POLICE? WHAT IF THEY REFER US STRAIGHT TO THE PERSON WHO KILLED JOHN RICHARDS? SOMEBODY KNOWS. SOMEBODY WHO TRIED TO KILL LIZZIE, WHO DID KILL RICHARDS. SOMEBODY IS WATCHING US. I CAN'T DO THIS AGAIN. SUSAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. NO, I CAN'T. SUSAN! SUSAN, HANG ON. I HAD TO MAKE MYSELF READY TO DIE FOR THEM. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? I KNOW, I KNOW. NO, YOU DON'T! YOU DON'T KNOW! THAT'S THE PROBLEM. YOU DON'T KNOW! NONE OF YOU DO! AND NOW IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER AGAIN. NONE OF YOU HAVE CHILDREN. I KNOW. NONE OF YOU HAVE FAMILIES, JEAN. AND NEITHER DID THE MEN WHO DIED THAT NIGHT. IT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY ON THE TELEPHONE. THE MEN IN THE CRASH. WE WERE GONNA TALK TO THEIR FAMILIES, FIND OUT WHO WAS ASKING QUESTIONS, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY, THEY DON'T HAVE FAMILIES, NONE OF THEM. NO--NO WIVES, NO, NO PARENTS, NO SWEETHEARTS. NOT ONE. NOW, TELL ME IS THAT A COINCIDENCE, OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE? I'M SO SORRY. I JUST CAN'T THINK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE. SUSAN, YOU'RE GOOD AT THIS TYPE OF THING. LOOK. WE NEED YOU. OTHER PEOPLE NEED ME MORE. ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT CAN BE DONE? I ALL I CAN TELL YOU MISS McBRIAN IS NOTHING CAN BE DONE. I'M TRULY SORRY. I KNOW SHE WAS YOUR FRIEND. SHE STILL IS MY FRIEND. THERE'S NOTHING YOU OR ANYONE ELSE CAN DO NOW. SHE REFUSED THE CHANCE OF AN APPEAL. ALICE MERREN WILL BE HANGED IN 5 DAYS' TIME. WHAT IF THERE WERE NEW EVIDENCE IN THE CASE? HYPOTHETICALLY SPEAKING. IF THERE WERE COMPELLING, CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE, WE COULD PRESENT IT TO THE HOME SECRETARY, BUT THERE ISN'T, IS THERE? WE NEED YOUR HELP. IT WAS EASIER TO GET TO SEE YOU THIS TIME. THEY LOOSEN UP THE REGULATIONS ONCE THE SENTENCE IS PASSED. IT'S COMPASSIONATE. IS THIS A BAD IDEA? NO. NO. TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT. ANYTHING'S BETTER THAN JUST WAITING. YOU KNEW JOHN BETTER THAN ANYONE. CAN YOU HAVE A LOOK AT THESE AND TELL US WHAT YOU THINK WE'RE MISSING? WE THINK JOHN FOUND OUT SOMETHING I ABOUT THIS CRASH HE SAW SOMETHING IN THESE REPORTS THAT SENT UP A RED FLAG, AND THAT HE WAS KILLED FOR IT, BUT WE CAN'T WORK OUT WHAT IT WAS. I F THERE'S A PATTERN OR A CLUE-- SSH, SSH, SSH. 4 MEN, AND NONE OF THEM HAVE LOVED ONES. FAR TOO MUCH OF A COINCIDENCE. THEY WERE CHOSEN. THAT'S WHAT JOHN SAW IN THESE STORIES. YOU'VE BEEN WORKING FROM A FALSE ASSUMPTION ALL ALONG. CODE 14, CORRUPTION IN THE DATA SET, REDO CALCULATION FROM START. YOU USED IT YOURSELVES TO GET TO SEE ME. WHAT? WHAT DI D WE GET WRONG? EVERYTHING COMES BACK TO THE MILITARY. YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THAT. YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT JOHN. HE WAS RECRUITED FOR BLETCHLEY, AND THEN HE WAS ASSIGNED SOMEWHERE ELSE, SOMEWHERE SECRET. COULDN'T TELL ME WHERE. WHAT IF HE NEVER LEFT? THE CAR CRASH ON SALISBURY PLAIN IS A COVER STORY. WHAT IF JOHN'S CAREER IS, AS WELL? WHAT IF HE DIDN'T NEED TO SEE A CLUE IN THESE NEWSPAPER REPORTS BECAUSE HE ALREADY KNEW THE STORY... FROM THE INSIDE. BLOOD ON HIS HANDS. ALICE, DO YOU THINK JOHN COULD HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE DEATHS? I DON'T KNOW. HE WAS A GOOD MAN. HE WOULDN'T-- THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE IS THAT JOHN WASN'T WORKING FOR SOME FERTILIZER COMPANY AFTER THE WAR. HE WAS STILL WORKING FOR THE ARMY. AND WHATEVER JOHN WAS DOING FOR THE ARMY IS WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO COVER UP. SO WHICH DEPARTMENT IN THE ARMY WAS HE WORKING FOR? SORRY. I HAVE TO GO NOW. JEAN, WILL YOU-- COULD YOU GIVE LIZZIE MY LOVE? OF COURSE. THANK YOU. RICHARDS DIDN'T JUST DISAPPEAR FOR 12 YEARS. HE WAS POSTED SOMEWHERE. WE NEED TO FIND OUT WHERE. WELL, DON'T LOOK AT ME. I'M NO USE TO YOU. ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW ARE CONNECTIONS FROM THE ARMY OR THE GOVERNMENT, AND AND OUR CARDS ARE MARKED THERE. IF WE GO ASKING ANY OF THEM ABOUT-- JEAN, THE MILITARY ARCHIVES WILL SHOW WHERE HE WAS POSTED. THE POLICE. A SCOTLAND YARD REQUISITION FORM WOULD GET YOU IN. YOU COULD LOSE YOUR JOB. BUT NOT MY LIFE. BEN, IS THE DCI IN? UH, NO. MEETING UPSTAIRS. WHAT WAS IT? UM, RECORDS DEPARTMENT WANTED A SIGNATURE ON THIS. IT'S JUST FILE REQUESTS. WHO WANTS IT? A SOMEBODY FOWLER, I THINK. DON FOWLER? MM-HMM. THE DCI's SUPPOSED TO SIGN FOR RESTRICTED FILES. YEAH, I--I KNOW. UM... THERE. DON'T TELL ANYONE. I'LL HAVE ALL YOU GIRLS KNOCKING ON MY DOOR. PROMISE. NO PAPERWORK MUST LEAVE THE ROOM. AT BLETCHLEY AND AFTER BLETCHLEY Millie, voice-over: TWO PILES-- ANYTHING AT ALL WITH RICHARDS' NAME ON IT. AH, HERE WE GO. CLASSIFIED AND REDACTED. Millie, voice-over: THERE'S STILL NOTHING POST BLETCHLEY. BLETCHLEY. BLETCHLEY. THIS IS A DEAD END. NOTHING HERE SHOWS US WHERE RICHARDS WAS POSTED. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO AT IT A DIFFERENT WAY. HE LEFT BLETCHLEY, AND HE WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE. I MEAN, HE LITERALLY WENT SOMEWHERE ELSE. HE TOOK A TRAIN. TRAVEL ORDERS. GOOD GIRL. LET'S SEE, SHALL WE? HERE WE GO. RICHARDS, J. I TRAVEL ORDER 6741 FOURTH OF APRIL, COUNTERSIGNED AND STAMPED. BLETCHLEY TO SALISBURY. SALISBURY. SALISBURY PLAIN IS WHERE THE CRASH HAPPENED. SALISBURY IS WHERE THE FAKE FERTILIZER COMPANY IS SUPPOSED TO BE. SO WHAT'S IN SALISBURY? THERE. WHAT IS IT? TRANSFER REQUEST DOCKET. RICHARDS, J. FOURTH OF APRIL 1943. FROM THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND CYPHER SCHOOL, BLETCHLEY, TO THE BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, PORTON, SALISBURY. THE BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT? OH, MY GOD. THAT PLACE. JEAN? WHAT'S AT PORTON? IT'S CALLED PORTONDOWN NOW. IT STARTED IN THE GREAT WAR, MAKING MUSTARD GAS. BY THE LAST WAR, IT WAS THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'S RESEARCH LABORATORY FOR CHEMICAL WEAPONS. AS FAR AS I KNOW, IT STILL IS. Jean: RICHARDS WAS COLLECTING NEWSPAPER ARTICLES. HE TOLD LIZZIE THAT THEY WERE VITAL. NOW IF THIS STORY'S WHAT WE THINK IT IS, IF THEY'RE COVERING UP SOMETHING FAR WORSE THAN JUST AN ACCIDENT AND IF RICHARDS WAS TO BLAME FOR THAT, HE'D HAVE NO REASON TO BE COLLECTING NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS. HE DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL HE READ IT IN THE PAPER, BUT THE MINUTE HE READ IT, HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS. HE KNEW THE TRUTH BEHIND THE COVER STORY. HE'D SEEN IT BEFORE. HE HAD BLOOD ON HIS HANDS BUT NOT FROM THIS. THIS HORRIFIED HIM. THIS MADE HIM COLLECT EVIDENCE AND GIVE IT TO LIZZIE FOR SAFEKEEPING. THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT? HE WAS GONNA BLOW THE WHISTLE. HE KNEW WHAT THEY WOULD DO. SO THEY KILLED HIM. WHAT ON GOD'S EARTH DID THEY DO TO THOSE MEN? WE COULD FIND OUT. WELL, THEY WERE HOSPITALIZED. WE JUST NEED TO FIND OUT WHICH HOSPITAL. Jean: LIZZIE? SHE'S GONE. VISITOR. WHO IS IT? YOU MUST BE ANGRY. I WOULD BE. WE WERE VERY YOUNG. IT FELT LIKE THE ONLY THING TO DO. I'M SORRY. I REALLY AM. IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT DOES, THOUGH. DID YOU LOVE HIM? YES. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU STAY TOGETHER? IT WASN'T THAT SIMPLE. HE WAS ENGAGED TO SOMEONE ELSE. BUT... HIS FAMILY... HE DIDN'T LOVE HER, AND THEN THE WAR. DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT ME? ALL THE TIME. EVERY DAY. SO DID JOHN. I MISS HIM. ME, TOO. IT'S ALL RIGHT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY. YOU CAN GO IF YOU LIKE. NO, NO. I WANT TO STAY. I WANT TO SEE YOU. I JUST-- I WANT TO STAY. GIDDYAP, HORSY. COME ON! I TOLD JEAN I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME TO DO SOMETHING I CAN'T DO? BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN DO IT, AND NONE OF THE REST OF US CAN. ONE MAN DEAD, 3 MEN WITH CHEMICAL BURNS. THAT MUCH WE KNOW IS TRUE. IT'S THE CAUSES AND THE REASONS THAT ARE A PACK OF LIES. WHATEVER WAS DONE TO THOSE MEN WAS DONE ON PURPOSE, AND IT WAS DONE IN THE NAME OF THE ARMY OR THE GOVERNMENT. I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WORSE, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SHOW BECAUSE THEN WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT ALICE MERREN WASN'T RESPONSIBLE FOR JOHN RICHARDS' MURDER. WHY ARE YOU HERE, MILLIE? LUCY FOUND WHERE THEY'RE TREATING THE SOLDIERS. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PUBLIC. THE SOLICITOR CAN APPROACH THE HOME SECRETARY IN CAMERA AND HAVE THE CASE DECLARED NULL, BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENS WITHOUT PROOF. I'M RIGHT, AREN'T I? IT'S THE SAME HOSPITAL WHERE TIMOTHY WAS TREATED AFTER THE WAR. ALL THOSE EXERCISES, ALL THAT PHYSICAL THERAPY, I LEARNING TO WALK AGAIN AND ALL THE WHILE YOU WERE THERE BY HIS SIDE. YOU WERE A FIXTURE. IT WAS 7 YEARS AGO. IT ONLY TAKES ONE NURSE TO REMEMBER YOU. SOMEONE'S BOUND TO. I HAVE NO REASON TO GO BACK THERE. YES, YOU DO. THERE'S A FOREIGN POSTING COMING YOUR WAY. YOU NEED TIMOTHY'S MEDICAL RECORDS FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANY. YOU WOULDN'T ASK, BUT YOU JUST NEED A QUICK FAVOR. YOU'RE IN A HURRY. GOSH, YOU'VE GOT ALL THE ANSWERS, HAVEN'T YOU? SHE'S A LOT LIKE YOU. SHE'S NOTHING LIKE ME. SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GIVING HERSELF UP TO SAVE HER DAUGHTER'S LIFE. IT ISN'T JUST ALICE, EITHER. LIZZIE'S GONE MISSING. Lucy: THERE'S AN ENTRY HERE ON THE COMPANY THAT EMPLOYED RICHARDS. EVEN IF PORTON IS A SECRET, THE COVER COMPANY THAT THEY CREATED, THAT HAS TO BE PUBLIC, AND THERE'S A CEO LISTED FOR THE COMPANY. YES. DANIEL THOMAS. I KNOW. I TRIED THAT. HE'S A FAKE, TOO. BUT THAT'S NOW, BUT TEN YEARS AGO, THE CEO WAS LISTED AS OLIVER MASTERS. SO? THEY CHANGED THE FAKE BOSS OF THE FAKE COMPANY. MASTERS ISN'T FAKE. TIMOTHY, CAN I ASK YOU ABOUT THE ARMY? IF YOUR COMMANDING OFFICER DID SOMETHING THAT WAS WRONG, WOULD YOU STILL BE PROUD? YES. THE ARMY ISN'T A MAN. IT'S NOT MY COMMANDING OFFICER OR THE BATTALION COMMANDER OR THE GENERAL. IT'S MORE THAN ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE. PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES, DO CRUEL OR FOOLISH THINGS. SOMETIMES THEY DO EVIL THINGS, BUT DO WE THINK THE ENTIRE GERMAN ARMY WAS EVIL, OR WERE THEY JUST FOLLOWING THE ORDERS OF AN EVIL MAN? THE ARMY'S ABOUT LOYALTY AND DISCIPLINE. THOSE WERE THE THINGS I FELT PROUD OF. I SUPPOSE I'D LIKE TO FEEL THEM AGAIN. EXCEPT WITHOUT THE BULLETS. EXCEPT WITHOUT THE BULLETS, YEAH. MASTERS' RESEARCH IS MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THESE JOURNALS. OK. HERE WE GO. OLIVER MASTERS, CEO, NEWGATE LABORATORIES, BUT HERE... PROFESSOR OLIVER MASTERS, CROSSOVER FUNCTIONS OF DISEASES OF THE METABOLISM, 1936. NEURAL DECAY AS A PRECURSOR OF METABOLIC FAILURE, 1937. TWO OTHER PAPERS IN 1938, ONE ON HUMAN BIOLOGY, ONE ON BIOCHEMISTRY, AND THEN THE WAR STARTS, AND HE JUST VANISHES. OH, HE DOESN'T VANISH. HE JUST STOPS PUBLISHING. HOW DID YOU REALIZE? I RECOGNIZED THE NAME. HE SIGNED THE TRANSFER REQUEST. I MEAN, HE MUST'VE KNOWN RICHARDS IF HE WAS THE ONE ASKING FOR HIM TO BE SECONDED TO PORTON. MAYBE HE'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT RICHARDS WAS INVOLVED WITH. WHERE'S PROFESSOR MASTERS NOW? ACCORDING TO THIS, HE RETIRED. 5 YEARS BACK WHEN THE CEO CHANGED TO DANIEL THOMAS. I THINK TOMORROW WE SHOULD DIG HIM OUT OF RETIREMENT, DON'T YOU? GOOD LUCK. THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS. I HOPE YOU FIND MASTERS. UH, THOMAS PARK MILITARY HOSPITAL, PLEASE. BRAVE GIRL. HEIGHT, PLEASE. 5'9". 14 INCHES. Woman: MISS HAVERS! GOOD GRACIOUS! WHAT A SURPRISE! HELLO, LILY. IT MUST BE... 7 SEVEN YEARS. YES. UH, IT'S NOT MISS HAVERS ANYMORE. IT'S MRS. GREY. WE ALWAYS KNEW IT WOULD BE ONE DAY. HOW IS HE? OH... GOOD. VERY GOOD INDEED. STICK'S GONE, LEG'S AS GOOD AS NEW. WHAT ON EARTH BRINGS YOU BACK HERE? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FILL OUT A HUNDRED FORMS, YOU KNOW. I KNOW. WE DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL YESTERDAY, AND THEN-- DON'T WORRY. JUST DON'T TELL ANYONE. NO, OF COURSE. LIEUTENANT TIMOTHY GREY, DISCHARGED SIXTH OF MARCH 1946. IT SHOULD BE ALL IN THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOSH! THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF IT. WELL, THEN I SHALL LET YOU GET ON. UM, GIVE ME A CALL IF YOU NEED ANYTHING. WARD C. IT'LL BE YEARS BEFORE WE ESTABLISH... [AIR HISSING] WHO ARE YOU? UM, I'M... FROM PORTON DOWN. I--I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. YOU A SCIENTIST? THAT'S RIGHT. AND YOU WANT TO ASK ME WHAT HAPPENED? YES. YOU SHOULD KNOW. YOU DID IT. DON'T YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU DID? SORRY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. PISS OFF. I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. YOU CAN ASK WHAT YOU LIKE. IT'S NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE, IS IT? IT'S NOT GONNA FIX ME. YOU LIED TO US, LIED TO US ALL, ALL OF YOU DID. WHAT DID WE LIE ABOUT? WE WERE GONNA HELP PEOPLE, DO SOMETHING USEFUL. CURE FOR THE COMMON COLD. WASN'T A CURE FOR ANYTHING, WAS IT? JUST A BLOODY WEAPON. AND THEN JIMMY WAS SCREAMING AND DYING ON THE FLOOR, AND YOU LOT STOOD THERE MAKING NOTES. ALL YOU DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS CAN GO AND HANG YOURSELVES. THEY TOLD YOU IT WAS MEDICINE? WHO ARE YOU? SoIdier: MISS, THIS IS A RESTRICTED AREA. I'M SORRY, I'M SO SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET YOU. SUSAN? PROFESSOR MASTERS? MAY WE HAVE A WORD? IT'S ABOUT THE CRASH THAT HAPPENED NEAR SALISBURY. SALISBURY? NEAR PORTON DOWN. COME IN. WE CAN HAVE YOU IMPRISONED IMMEDIATELY FOR SPYING ON A MILITARY ESTABLISHMENT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING? Masters: I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND. YOU KNEW JOHN RICHARDS BACK IN THE WAR. YOU REQUESTED HIS TRANSFER FROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO PORTON. WE THINK THAT AFTER YOU RETIRED FROM PORTON SOMETHING HAPPENED. SOMETHING JOHN WAS PREPARED TO LIVE WITH UNTIL THIS CRASH WAS REPORTED. THE--THE CRASH IS A COVER STORY, ISN'T IT? WHATEVER JOHN WAS ASHAMED OF IT WAS HAPPENING AGAIN BUT THIS TIME HE WAS PREPARED TO--TO SAY SOMETHING TO STOP IT. ONLY SOMEONE KILLED HIM FOR IT. AN INNOCENT WOMAN IS GONNA HANG FOR THIS DEATH UNLESS WE CAN SHOW WHAT REALLY HAPPENED. PL--PLEASE WILL YOU TALK TO US? WHERE'S THE OTHER ONE? WHAT? THERE ARE 4 OF YOU. WE'RE ONE SHORT. WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND? MRS. GREY, I REALLY DO ADVISE YOU TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF, OR THIS IS GOING TO GO VERY BADLY FOR YOU INDEED. [KNOCK ON DOOR] COME. OH, UM, PLEASE, SIT DOWN. SEE IF YOU CAN TALK SOME SENSE INTO HER. WHAT ON EARTH'S HAPPENING? ALL RIGHT. STOP. STOP KEEPING THINGS FROM ME. YOU ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. DON'T THINK I DON'T KNOW. DAMN IT. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT LOCKING YOU UP. THE CHILDREN WITHOUT A MOTHER. IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT? STOP IT. I WILL STOP WHEN YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH. I IF I TELL YOU THE TRUTH I'M BREAKING THE LAW. THEY'LL LOCK ME UP ANYWAY. I DON'T WANT RIDDLES, SUSAN. I WANT TO KNOW. THE TRUTH? YES! I WORKED AT THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND CYPHER SCHOOL AT BLETCHLEY PARK. WE INTERCEPTED SIGNALS INTELLIGENCE AND... BROKE GERMAN ENCRYPTION. THAT'S WHO I AM, THAT'S WHO I AM, TIMOTHY. WE SAVED LIVES. WE--WE MADE A DIFFERENCE. I TRIED. YOU WANT THE TRUTH? THE TRUTH IS THAT THE MEN IN THIS HOSPITAL WEREN'T HURT IN A CHEMICAL SPILL. THEY WERE POISONED BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT IN SECRET WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT. THEY HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS BEING DONE TO THEM. THEY WERE JUST LABORATORY RATS FOR A WEAPONS EXPERIMENT. JOHN RICHARDS WAS GOING TO SPILL THE BEANS, IF YOU WILL, AND SOMEONE KILLED HIM, AND NOW, YOU WERE GOING TO LET A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL TAKE THE BLAME FOR IT. THAT'S THE TRUTH AND NOW AN INNOCENT WOMAN IS GOING TO HANG FOR SOMETHING ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE DID. THAT IS THE TRUTH! DO YOU WANT ME TO GO ON OR HAVE YOU HEARD ENOUGH' ? SO WHO WAS IT? WHO KILLED HIM? WAS IT YOU OR DID YOU' JUST GIVE THE ORDER? YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL ME. OH, GOD. IF YOU DON'T, I'M SURE MASTERS WILL. HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO MASTERS? MY FRIENDS ARE WITH HIM NOW. HE MAY BE RETIRED, BUT I'M SURE HE KNOWS PLENTY ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON HERE. THE CH--CHEMICAL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS CALLED SARIN. IT'S THE FUTURE. WHEN WE PUSHED THROUGH GERMANY AFTER THE WAR, WE DISCOVERED STOCKPILES OF THE MOST INGENIOUS HORRORS. NERVE GASSES THAT KILL IN MOMENTS, AEROSOL AGENTS C-CAPABLE OF PENETRATING THE SKIN ASTONISHING AND AWFUL CREATIONS. THAT KIND OF THREAT HAS TO BE COUNTERED. MEN LOST THEIR LIVES. ONE OR TWO. THEY'RE CASUALTIES OF WAR. THE WAR'S OVER. YOU HAVE THE... NERVE TO SAY THAT TO ME? WHO'S YOUR CONTACT? I WANT THE NAME OF YOUR CONTACT, YOUR HANDLER. I GIVE YOU MY WORD, THIS WILL GO EASIER FOR YOU IF YOU COOPERATE. LET ME JUST GET THIS STRAIGHT. RICHARDS WAS GOING TO TALK PUBLICLY ABOUT AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED AT PORTON DOWN? YOU'RE CERTAIN OF THIS? YES. THAT'S WHY HE WAS KILLED. IT WAS A DOMESTIC MURDER. NO. IT WAS AN ASSASSINATION. LOOK. A YOUNG GIRL CALLED ELIZABETH LANCASTER WAS FRAMED FOR IT. WAR DOCUMENTS WERE PLANTED IN HER FLAT SO THAT THE CASE WOULD COME UNDER MILITARY JURISDICTION BUT HER MOTHER STUMBLED ACROSS THE CRIME SCENE, THOUGHT THE WORST, AND PUT HERSELF IN HER PLACE. LOOK. YOU KNOW ALL THIS. I MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT. WELL THEN IF YOU DON'T MIND ME SAYING, YOU'RE NOT IN POSSESSION OF THE FACTS. YOU SAY YOUR FRIENDS ARE TALKING TO MASTERS NOW. YES. PERHAPS HE'LL KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. Timothy: WHA--WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S THE MATTE R? MASTERS DIDN'T RETIRE. HE'S BEEN PROMOTED. HE WAS MADE HEAD OF THE WHOLE DIVISION AND IS EVIDENTLY WORKING ON HIS OWN. I'M--I'M, SORRY. WHO DO YOU THINK WE ARE? ENEMIES OF THE STATE. NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE WRONG--UNH! AAH! AAH! AAH! Masters : DON'T BE FOOLISH. YOU'RE TRAITORS, ALL OF YOU. I KNOW WHAT RICHARDS WAS DOING, PASSING INFORMATION TO THE LANCASTER GIRL AND NOW YOU 4. I WANT THE NAME OF YOUR CONTACT. YOU THOUGHT SHE WAS A SPY. YOU THOUGHT WE WERE SPIES. HE WAS PASSING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION TO THE RUSSIANS. NOW TELL ME WHO YOUR... CONTACT IS BEFORE THIS GETS A GREAT DEAL LESS PLEASANT. [TELEPHONE RINGING] COME WITH ME. [MOANING] STAY WHERE I CAN SEE YOU. [RINGING] MASTERS, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT JOHN RICHARDS. [DIAL TONE] [DIALING] OPERATOR. GET ME THE LONDON OFFICE. NOW. YES, SIR. FRIENDS IN HIGH PLACES INDEED. HOW FAR DOES THIS GO? TELL ME NOW AND TELL ME WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR. I HAVE TO SAFEGUARD THE THINGS WE VALUE-- HONOR AND DECENCY... GOODNESS. [SIRENS] I AM A PATRIOT. WHEREAS--OH--YOU WOULD HAVE US ALL RULED FROM MOSCOW IN THE NAME OF SO-CALLED EQUALITY. WHAT YOU DID WAS--WAS EVIL. WELL, YOU'RE ABOUT TO FIND OUT JUST HOW WRONG YOU ARE. THEY'RE THE TRAITORS. THERE THEY ARE. PUT THE GUN DOWN! ARREST THEM. NOW! GUN ON THE FLOOR! DO IT! NOW! DISMISSED. EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT, BUT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS HAS BEEN HURT. ONLY A FLESH WOUND, AS I UNDERSTAND IT. MY MEN ARE LOOKING AFTER HER. HURT? SORRY, WHO-- WHO--WHO'S HURT? I'M SORRY. I DON'T HAVE ANY NAMES. I--I HAVE TO SEE THEM. I HAVE TO GO. I'LL GET YOU A CAR. UM, WHAT MY WIFE SAID ABOUT THOSE MEN BEING EXPERIMENTED ON. IT'S--IT'S NOT TRUE IS IT? I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THAT, SIR, AND NEITHER CAN YOU. I'LL GET SOMEONE TO TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL. Jean: A BUNCH OF CODE BREAKERS. [ALL LAUGHING] JEAN! HOW DO WE... FIX THIS? WE'LL START AGAIN. I WANT YOU TO TAKE THE JOB. WHAT? AND--AND I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE CHILDREN BEHIND. I WANT US ALL TO START AGAIN IN SOME... EXCITING NEW PLACE. YES. YOU'D BE AN EXCELLENT TEACHER. OR MAYBE RESEARCH. WHATEVER YOU WANTED. I--I COULD MAKE SOME CALLS, FIND OUT. GOD, I'D LIKE THAT. [KNOCK ON WINDOW] HELLO! HI, MUMMY. WHY ARE YOU IN AN ARMY CAR? BECAUSE YOUR MUMMY IS A HERO. COME ON YOU. Millie: YOUR VERY OWN BIG ADVENTURE. PERHAPS THIS TIME IT WILL BE. WE'LL MISS YOU. I'LL MISS YOU. I'LL MISS YOU, TOO. SEND US A POSTCARD, ALL RIGHT? LET ME KNOW WHERE YOU WIND UP. PROMISE. I HAVE TO GO. THANK YOU.
