 That Girl (1966–1971): Season 1, Episode 1 - Don't Just Do Something, Stand There - full transcript 
 Aspiring actress Ann Marie, recently arrived in New York City, is working at a newsstand in the lobby of an office building when she is spotted by two men looking to film a television commercial made to look like a hold up. Ann excitedly agrees to be the damsel in distress for the commercial to be filmed later that evening at the newsstand itself. That same day, Ann meets Donald Hollinger, a writer with Newsview Magazine, whose offices are located in that building. Ann and Donald, while friendly enough to each other, are on opposing sides of wanting to buy the same roll top desk in a business moving sale. Even at 50% off, Ann can only afford to buy the desk from the money earned doing the commercial, so Donald seems to be her only obstacle. Despite having an unspoken attraction to each other, an unfortunate incident during the filming of the commercial leads to a series of misunderstandings between Ann and Donald which may prevent them from moving beyond spearmint gum seller and buyer.

 It's perfect, Ernie. We'll shoot the whole commercial right here in the lobby. You really think it's better than a baseball park? Not only better, it's cheaper. It's perfect. Jungle madness brings out the beast in a man, even in New York, the heart of civilization. Yeah, I see what you mean. What would a girl be doing all alone in a baseball park? Shaggin' flies. Yeah, this is it. You hear a scream. Two guys drag the girl past the elevators, past the candy counter... Into a waiting car.

 We'll use my car. If the agency doesn't buy this, we're gonna get out of the commercial business. If they don't buy this, we're gonna have to get out of the commercial business. All right, now we've got the car, the building, Mike and Jim... All we need now is an actress. What actress? All we need is a young girl with a cute face who can take a punch. We can use any girl. Name one. I got her. Who? That girl. ♪♪ [Theme song] You're perfect. Perfect. Isn't she perfect, Ernie? Nice, yes. Thanks. What'll you have?

 We want you. There's a doorman outside, 6'5", all I've got to do is whistle. Wait a minute. How would you like to be an actress? An actress? I am an actress. You're an actress? Well, even an actress has to earn a living. Is this for a play? No, it's a kind of film. A film? You mean a movie film? No, it's not a movie, it's a commercial. A commercial? That's terrific. Well I mean, millions of people watch commercials. I could be discovered from a commercial. Sure, it happens all the time. Now what do you say, will you do it? Do I? Where do I go and when? Right here, tonight at 7. Tonight? Oh, doesn't give me much time to learn my lines. For your part, you got enough time. See you at 7. Oh, wait a minute. What about my script? You don't need one. What do I do? All you've got to do is scream. Ah? I scream great. Through your nose? What? No, you're gonna be tied up. You're gonna have a piece of tape across your mouth. Uh huh. What kind of part is this? It's gonna be what you make it, kid. You've got to sell it. You can do it, too. You're gonna make a lot of it, with your eyes. My eyes? Yeah, sell panic and fear with your eyes. Panic and fear. Yeah, yeah. You'll see. See you later. [whispering] Panic and fear... [screams] Yes, sir? May I have a pack of Spearmint, please? Oh yes, Spearmint gum. Here it is. Five cents. Thank you. Here you are. Thanks a lot. [screams] This isn't going to be easy. I've got a charley horse in my eyebrow. Hi. Hi. I'm Shirley McChesney from Custom Interiors on the 16th floor, and the owner asked if maybe we could put this sign on the counter. Custom Interiors close out sale. I didn't know there was a shop like that upstairs. Nobody else did, either. That's why we're moving. Oh, hey, wait a minute. I don't suppose you have a roll-top desk up there? Oh yeah, a great one. Oh, terrific. I've been looking everywhere. My Dad is dying for one. Well now's the time to buy it. 50% off, but you better get up there fast because a lot of people are starting to come in. Oh. I'm stuck here till my lunch break. Well... don't put the sign up until after lunch. That's kind of sneaky, isn't it? Look, you're doing us a favor. Just do it a little later. Thanks a lot. Hi. Oh, hi. Um, it's over there against that wall. [Ann] Oh, it looks perfect. If you're interested in buying it, Mr. Rudolph, the owner, will be back this afternoon. Oh good. Can I look at it now? Sure. Hey, wha...? Oh, it's you. The top was stuck. Oh, well take it easy. You might break my desk. Here, would you hold this for me, please? Sure. Are you Mr. Rudolph, the owner of this shop? No, I'm Don Hollinger, the buyer of this desk. How can you be? I'm buying this desk. I... I'm sorry, but I was here first. I didn't see you, and I was standing right here. I didn't see you, either. Well that's because you were behind the desk. Right. And since I had to be in front of the desk in order to get behind it, I must have been here first. But if you didn't see me come in last, how do you know I wasn't here first? Wait a minute. Um, squat. Squat yourself. Please, just squat down. Please, just behind the desk. Please, please just squat. Go ahead. Squat. Okay. Okay, now I'm in front of the desk and I can't see you. Then how do you know I wasn't here first? You're making this very difficult. I'm sorry. I don't mean to. Look, I want to be fair about this. Fine. I was here first, so I'm buying the desk. You were probably still downstairs making faces in the mirror. That was uncalled for. I know. Why do you do it? It has nothing to do with my desk. It's not your desk, it's my desk. Oh, well then, why don't you buy it? Now you know perfectly well that I can't buy this desk until the owner gets back. Right? Exactly. And for the same reason you can't buy it either. Right, so nobody's here first till the owner gets here. And if we're both here when the owner comes in, nobody is here first. That's a very interesting theory. [Ann] Do you agree? Well, how can I? I'm not here yet. Look, I don't have time to keep talking to you. I've got to get back to work. Look, so do I. Oh, do you work in the building? Yes, "News View Magazine". What a coincidence, I work downstairs. Yes, yes. I know that. Hey, I've got an idea. I can't wait. We'll both put down a $10 deposit so nobody else can buy the desk. Well, that's, that's a beginning. And then later on we'll decide between us which one should get it. No, no, I can't do it later, I'm working tonight. So am I. Well, look, what about tomorrow during lunch? Look, I really don't think that's a good idea. I mean it's always wise in these kind of things not to confuse it with a social relationship. I said during lunch. I didn't suggest we eat together. Oh. Okay, let's give the lady our deposit. Well, I, uh... What's wrong now? Well, there's just one thing. What? Could you lend me $10? Perfect, perfect. All right, Gary, up here, beside the actress. We're going to get ready to roll. Good, Honey. Good, good. We'll practice that later. Now, when they run in there and grab you, I want a lot of that nose screaming, and a lot of kicking. Remember that. A lot of screaming and a lot of kicking. Got it? And my eyes. Oh yeah, and your eyes. A lot of eyes, a lot of eyes. What's this commercial for? Perfume. Perfume? Yeah, perfume. This commercial is gonna show that even the girl behind the candy counter gets carried away when she's wearing Jungle Madness. You like that? Oh, yes. It's great. Just great. Thank you. All right, now let's get this on you. Oh, wait a minute. You're sure I'll have my check tomorrow? Well what's the matter? Don't you trust us? Oh, yes, yes, I do trust you. It's just that I have to have the check, in case I get the desk. What desk? Oh, this terrific desk. You know, right after I first saw you, there was a guy here buying gum. We both went upstairs at this decorator's shop on the 16th floor and saw this great desk, and my father's always wanted one all of his life just like that. I really want to buy it for him, and you really don't care. No. And you'll get your money tomorrow. All right guys, now, get her up there. Pick her up, nice and gentle. Get her over behind that stand so we can get to work. We're gonna roll. All right. Easy. Fine. Very good. Now you can practice your screaming while they are doing this. Ok. All right. Fine. All right Tom, you get out of here now. Jim, I'm sorry. Now, close that up. Now, listen to me guys. When I yell "Action", go. Carry her out of that stand, shoot her past the elevators, make your turn off around that corner. Got it? Get your gun out. Stand by, we're gonna roll. Ernie, are you ready? Yup. Good. All right, stand by to roll. Nose, baby, nose. And eyes. Remember that. Keep it going. And, roll it. And... Action. Well come on. Move out, guys. Go, go. Good, fine, in there. All right, fine, now get her out [Screaming] Nice, very nice. Good. Now keep the gun up. Keep it up, that's good. Get the eyes going. Nose, nose. More nose. Good, good. Very good. Good. Hey, wait. Don't worry, don't worry. This is an express elevator to the 16th floor. When we get there, we take the express to the 32nd floor. They've got to take the locals up. By the time they get to the 16th, they won't know if we took the locals back down or the express up. And by that time, we can call the police, the whole building will be surrounded. [screaming] Don't worry. Please don't worry. I know exactly what I am doing. [whirring noise] I'm having a heart attack. Wait, wait a minute. Come on now, hurry up. Come on. Wait, will you calm down? I'm trying to help you. Stop, please. Now wait. Stop it, please. Wait, stop it please. Here. You're tearing my face, you're ripping my face, you crazy person. What do you think you're... What are you doing? Get a hold of yourself. What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing? I'm saving your life. Well, thanks. Thanks a lot. Now, don't worry about that, you can thank me later. Thank you? For what, ruining my career? Now how is my saving your life gonna stop you from selling candy and gum? I am not a gum seller. I am an actress. Or was... It... But... But those two guys? Those weren't guys, those were actors. What? Yes. We were shooting a commercial, when who comes charging into the scene like... Captain Dumb-dumb. Look, I didn't know. I, I mean I thought you were in trouble, really in trouble. Well now I am really in trouble. I bet they'd fire me. Oh, look, I'm sorry. I... I'm... Look, is there anything I can do to help? Yes, you can... No, no... I know, don't say it. Don't say it. I'm going up to the 32nd floor. Don't ever try to find me. Wait a minute! You forgot to untie me! Shoot. Can we do another take? So he went up to the 32nd floor and I went down to the lobby. We didn't get through with the commercial until about 4:00 this morning. Gee, I hope it turns out good. Okay, but what happened to the guy in the elevator? I don't know. We were there until 4:00 and he never came down. He's probably still up there wandering around. Hey, maybe he's like the Phantom of Notre Dame. Or the Hunchback of the Opera. You know, living up there in the elevator shaft, and only coming down in the night to attack people. Judy, he works in the building. Oh, you know him? Only to scream at. First with the desk and then the elevator. You know, I've been thinking about it all night. He was really very brave. He didn't know those men were actors. He thought they were real crooks. It took a lot of courage. He's not a monster at all. He's a regular three musketeer. Is he cute? Yeah, he is kinda cute. Gee, a handsome swashbuckler sweeps you up in his arms and rides off in his elevator. That's so romantic. I guess it was, until he ripped the tape off. Yeah, that must've hurt. And you know what I did instead of thanking him for saving my life? I balled him out. You know actually that wasn't very nice. Actually, it was rotten. You know what I should do? Apologize. No. I think you should. No, I mean I'm gonna apologize, but I owe him more than an apology. So give him an apology and free gum for a week. I don't think he's the kinda guy who'd take free gum from a lady. I know what I'll do. I'll let him buy my father's desk. Yeah, well from the way you told it, he was there first anyway. Judy, that has nothing to do with it. Well, what are you so upset about? You just said you were gonna let him buy the desk. Well I am. But I wanna let him buy it to be nice. Not because he deserves it. Excuse me? Yes? Are you the owner? Yes, I am. Oh good. I work downstairs and I was up here yesterday when you weren't here. Oh, sorry I missed you. Well, what I came up about was- You see that desk over there? Yes? Well, I put down a $10.00 deposit on it with Mr. Hollinger who also put down a deposit, and what I wanted to tell you is, I'd like to give up my deposit and let Mr. Hollinger buy it. Oh, you don't like the desk? Oh no. I love it. I've been looking for one for months, except Mr. Hollinger was here first. Oh. Well, if you really want a desk like this I think I could find you one. But it... it wouldn't be easy. Are you really interested? Oh, I really am. Well of course I'm too busy during the day. I think we'll have to go desk-hunting at night. At night? Yes. Well I mean... you wouldn't mind, would you? Well, uh, well I just have to think about it. Think? Well, what is there to think about? Is it the money? Yes! That's it, the money. I just couldn't afford it. At the price I can get you, you couldn't afford not to have one. Listen, why don't we just go over to your desk there, I mean and your pen is there and your pad is there, and you probably wanna be real close to them so we could make out this transaction. Oh. Oh, it's you. This is Mr. Rudolf. He was just straightening everything out about the desk for me. Good for you. Yes, he's just taking care of everything. So I can see. Well, have fun. Hey, wait a minute. Who is he? He's the fellow I wanted to get the desk. But I don't think he understood. Well, let's not worry about him. He's already got a desk. Let's see if we can find something for you. Well actually, as a matter of fact, this is just the desk I want. I love this desk. I really want this desk. When smart girls play their cards right, they get exactly what they want. [desk slams] Aaah! What a shame. Listen, I really hope it's all right. But I'm not gonna stick around and find out. [cash register drawer ringing] May I have some gum, please? The usual? Fine. Before I give you this, I just want to explain about this morning. Listen, I went up there to tell that man to sell the desk to you. You really expect me to believe that? Well, I was doing it to thank you for rescuing me last night. Oh. Oh yeah, the rescue. Well, never fear. Captain Dumb-dumb is always here. I mean it. You didn't know it was a commercial. You really risked your life for me. Yeah, and I ruined your commercial. That's why I was upstairs this morning. I was gonna tell the guy to tell to let you buy the desk. Oh you didn't have to do that. Oh. Yeah, I realized that when I walked in. You seemed to have gotten the desk without any help from me. I did what? Well that's why I walked out. I didn't want to ruin another performance. I knew you thought that, I just knew it. Yeah well, what was I supposed to think? You were supposed to see that Mr. Rudolf was annoying me. You know, you really do have a problem, knowing when somebody needs help, and when they don't. Well you certainly aren't very good when it comes to helping people know you need help. The confusion could be in the eye of the beholder. May I have my gum, please? What about the desk? That you can have. I never want to see it again. Why, what's wrong with it? It would always remind me of a very painful experience. May I have my gum, please? Yes, you may. Thank you. Just a minute. What now? Five cents. Uh, hello. Oh, it's you. You've come back. Not out of choice, out of necessity. What is it? Well, there's a little change in plans. Mr. Hollinger doesn't want the desk anymore, so I'm buying it. Well frankly, I don't care which of you buys it. I just want to get it off my hands. That's a pun. I'm really sorry about that. Does it still hurt? Well, I don't think anything's broken... Yet. Well, I can see why you are going out of business. You're not very business-like. Oh, all right. Where would you like it delivered? To my father. Here's the address. And I'd like to look at this desk and see if it rolls back smoothly. It was stuck before. Oh yes, it just rolls back. See, it's stuck. No, it's nothing. It's nothing. It's just a little hard to open with one hand. Well, here, let me try. No, I'll do it. Mr. Rudolf, will you watch out? You're gonna get your hands hurt again. Don't touch that girl. You're getting a bit of a bore. Ughn! Don't hurt him. Oh Don, are you all right? I thought you were in trouble. Oh no, we were just having trouble with the desk. What are you doing up here? I came to get my deposit back. Are you sure you're okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm just looking for four-leaf clovers. Well, is there anything I can do to help? Yes, stay as far away from me as possible. [door closing] You had no right to hit him. He accosted me in my establishment, therefore I had a right to do whatever I wanted to, including belting him in the gut. You still want this desk? Yes, I do. [desk opening] No, wait a minute. I've changed my mind. Oh, you don't want the desk. No, I do want the desk, but I don't want to send it to my father. Where do you want it to go? I want it to go to Mr. Don Hollinger, in care of News View Magazine, right here in this building. Thank you. You mean that person who was just in here? That's right. You're gonna give this desk to that baboon? That baboon just happens to be Captain Dumb-dumb. Hi. Oh, hi. Are you closed? Oh no, not yet. Well I uh... I got the desk. You like it? Oh yeah, yeah. It's just what I always wanted. That was very nice of you. Oh, well. I thought it was the gentlemanly thing to do, considering it was really yours anyway. Oh. Well... Anyway, I owe you a desk. Okay. Oh here, wait a minute. Here's your half of the deposit back. Oh, thank you. Here's the $10 I owe you. Oh, yeah, that is mine isn't it? Yeah. Oh hey, could I have a pack of gum, please? Oh, is that all you have, a ten? Yeah, that's all. Well, the owner took the cash box. I don't have any change. Oh. I know where we can get some change. Oh, that's okay. You can owe it to me. Oh no, no, no, no, no. I already owe you a desk. Why don't I take you to dinner, and I can pay you back out of the check? Oh well... Come on. Do you have a favorite restaurant around here? Well, there is one I kind of like. There's this little Italian place around the corner. [Ann] I think you might like it. Is the food good? No, but the change is great. [laughing] You know, you really didn't have to take me out to dinner. Well, you didn't have to buy me the desk. I didn't really buy you the desk. You still have to pay for it. [Ann] Yes. You do. I don't. I don't. Are you ready for dessert, sir? Yeah, Ann? Oh, they all look so good. You pick first. Let's see. I uh, I think I'll have the Napoleon. Very good, sir. I think I'll have one of those too. Oh, I'm sorry, madame. But that's the only one left. I guess you'll just have to fight for it. [laughing] Your half. We should have thought of this with the desk. [laughing] Hi. I'm Marlo Thomas. I hope you liked our first show. Well actually, it wasn't our first show, it was our preview show. Our real first show will be on next week, when the season officially begins. Tonight you saw how "that girl" met her boyfriend. And in next week's show, you'll meet Ann Marie's parents, in the episode that shows what happens when she leaves home and goes to live in New York. And wherever you live, I hope you watch "That Girl", in color or black and white. I just want you to watch.
