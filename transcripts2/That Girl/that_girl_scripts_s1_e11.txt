 That Girl (1966–1971): Season 1, Episode 11 - What's in a Name? - full transcript 
 This episode is a revised version of the test pilot, with different characters and actors. Ann's agent, Harvey Peck, thinks that she should change her name to something more appropriate for an actress, as people are constantly asking him "'Ann Marie' what?" Ann does not like the idea, knowing how much it would upset her parents. As she predicted, Ann's father is furious with the idea, and will not speak to her unless her name is 'Ann Marie'. Ann has to decide soon - she has a part on a television show and needs to choose what name will appear for her in the credits.

 Mr. Kelly? Hi. Harvey Peck. Hi. Listen, uh, I was wondering if you made a decision yet on the girl for the part of the teller. Yeah. Well, uh, the girl I sent over, Ann Marie. She's... Huh? No, no, no. Marie's her last name. Ann Marie. Yeah. Well, uh, I think it'd be a very smart move, Mr. Kelly. Well, she's very much in demand. She's new but she's hot. Oh, yeah. People all over town are asking for her. Boy, where's my waitress?

 That girl. ♪♪ Well, what can I do for you, sir? How is the turkey hash? Oh, it's delicious. I had it yesterday. Thanks. I'll take a roast beef on rye and a cup of coffee. Good thinking. Hello? Is it for me? Are you expecting two crates of tomatoes? Yeah, okay. If you'd like, I can take these out, so you can stay and answer the phone. Oh, come on, Charlie. You know this is important.

 Important? You know what's important? Fresh tuna salad, crisp lettuce, oatmeal without lumps. That's important. You know, getting a part's important to me. Somewhere, somewhere, there's gotta be an actress that wants to be a waitress. I think I'll call him. Why don't you call him? He doesn't like me to call him. He gets angry when I call him. I better not. Because if there's anything important, he'll call me. He's my agent. I have a perfect right to call him. He's gonna be angry anyway, so I might as well call him. Hello, Mr. Peck, please. I'll hold. Listen, I hate to do this, but there are some nice people who would like to eat their lunch. Jimmy, will you please hold this for me? Yeah, sure. Thank you. And tell him when he gets on that I'll be right back. And tell him not to be angry. There you are. Roast beef sandwich and tuna salad. Oh, Miss? Yes, sir? May we have some mustard, please? Mustard. There you are, sir. Uh, Miss... Oh, that's not my table. Well, that's my mustard. Are you through with the mustard? Not quite. Oh, when you are, would you mind giving it back to him? Thanks. He'll give it back to you. He hung up. He was mad? No, he was busy. He said, the second you're done, get over there. Oh, that means I got the part. But why didn't he say so? Because I didn't get the part. What time is it? What time is it, Charlie? You'll be out of here in 30 more hamburgers. Oh, Charlie, make them all rare. There you are, and thank you very much. Annie, don't we get dessert? Oh, uh, Jimmy... Go ahead. I'll bring it. Annie, hope you get the part. Thanks. Hmm, come in. Mm. Well, what is it? Mm, ham and cheese. Oh, Harvey, did I get the part or didn't I? Hmm, want some malt? Good for you. Make you a big star. I got it! I got it! I got that part! Oh, Harvey, you're the best agent in the whole wide world. I did get it, didn't I? You got it. They said, "Tell Ann Marie what's-her-name she's got the part." Is that what they said? Oh, Harvey, a real part. That means, somebody's gonna actually pay me for doing what I love. That'll be like stealing. For that part, it'll be petty larceny. Ahem, uh, Annie... Annie? What's wrong? Well, uh... uh, my boss says... and I agree with him. W-w-what? About what? About changing your name. Change my name? We discussed that. No, we discussed discussing it, but we never really discussed it. Well, I don't wanna discuss it. Well, I do. Ann Marie is a very bad professional name. It sounds incomplete, like you don't have a last name. Nine out of ten people say, Ann Marie what? Nobody knows your last name. One out of ten people does. Ann, don't be funny when I'm trying to be serious. Well, Harvey, I, I just don't wanna talk about it. But why? My father would cry. Cry? Your father cries? Yes, he's a very sensitive man. Every time he hits me, he cries. Listen, I gotta represent you, hon, and you got a rotten name for representing. I just got a job, didn't I? Only because I happen to be a genius. You know how many times I had to tell the guy, "Marie is her last name". He thought I was a recording. Oh, Harvey, my parents would not understand. Boy, you sure know how to ruin a day. Hey, lady... I'm the guy who got you your first real acting job. I know, but then, before I even had a chance to celebrate, you brought up this whole name business. Well, it's gonna be on television for the first time this week. It should be the name you're gonna use. You mean I have to decide right now? Well, yeah, that's why we're talking so much when I could be finishing my lunch. I don't even know how to think of a name. Well, easy. Uh, the phone book. That's how I got my name. You changed your name? Well, I, uh, I had to, for professional reasons. No kidding. What was it before? Grace Kelly. No, it's true. I used to call up people and say I was Grace Kelly. And they'd say, "The actor or the agent?" It was very confusing. Will you come on. No. Grace had the same problem. That's why she ran off to Europe and married Price Bernie. See? It isn't so terrible. Will you at least think about it? Okay, I'll think about it. Listen, I'm gonna buy a bottle of champagne and have a celebration. You wanna come over tonight? I'd love to, but I'll be working. Aw. Did I thank you enough for getting me the part? No, but you don't have to. Just act good. Now, get out of here so I can finish my lunch. Okay, bye. And thanks, Grace. There you are, sir, $1.90. That only leaves 10 cents for your tip. Wish it would be more, but that wipes me out. Sorry. Sorry? Instead of champagne, you should've bought cream soda. I guess not everybody cares. Uh, sorry. Mr. Cochran, when I left here this morning, what was I? Ten minutes late. Right. So I left a waitress and I return... A drunk. No, an actress. I got a part. Congratulations. What time's the party? 7 o'clock. And if you come, bring your own glass. Boy that looks good. We better drink it fast before the bubbles disappear. Oh, no, the bubbles last for hours. Not if you're 98 above. Don, you make the toast. Okay. Sweetheart... No, not a love toast, a show-business toast. I'll make it. I'll save the love toast till later. Now, this may have been said before, but well, here goes. To Ann Marie, may your name be in lights forever. That's been said before. Thank you. Hmm. Great. Great. Listen, about my name. Do you think it's a good name for an actress? What do you mean? Well, my agent thinks I should change it. Oh, a stage name. Like Cary Grant is really Archibald Leach. He is? Sure. You ought to read some of those magazines you have in your waiting room. Wait, wait a minute, Judy. Ann, you wanna change your name? Well, I can see the advantage to it sometimes and my agent says it's very important. Well, honey, I don't see anything wrong with having a stage name. Well, I don't either, but I'm really thinking about my parents. Oh, they have to change their name, too? It's just that my father takes great pride in the family, and he won't like it. - Why, did you ask him? - I'm almost afraid to. Well, listen. Before you do, I suggest you pick the name you're gonna use. Why? He may surprise you and like it. I doubt that. Come on, let's think of a name now. It'll be fun. Yeah, I have to think up names for my patients all the time. How about, uh, Melody? Melody? Melody what? Oh, gee, I never have to think up a last name. The mothers always come in with those. Well, the first name may be enough. Cause when I tell my father what I have in mind, my last name may be mud. Melody Mud. It's nice. Filipina. How did those Hollywood actors and actresses come up with all those famous names? How about Balfida Barra? Well, that hasn't been used in a long time. You wouldn't think it'd be this hard. I haven't even come up with any good first names yet. Ben Casey. There was a nurse on the Ben Casey show with a great name. Now, what was it? Wait a second. I think I got it. If you do, I'll give you a kiss. All right, then pucker up. It's not only a great name, but it's one your father may like. What is it? Okay, now, listen to this. Marie Brewster. Marie Brewster. Well, it's not bad, but it's hardly worth a kiss. And why would her father like it? Why would my father like it? Well, because you come from Brewster and your last name is Marie. Right. So we'll use my last name as my first name and the name of my hometown as my last name. Right. Now, that's clever. Marie Brewster. I like it. And I think you might be right about my father. Okay. How about my kiss? Right after I call home and try it out. W-w-wait a minute. Under the circumstances, could I have it in advance? You're gonna call your father now? Not on your life. It's his lodge night. I'm gonna call my mother first and try it out on her. Okay, I'll wait for the kiss. Hello, Mom? Ann. Uh, is Daddy home? Oh, that's right. I forgot. Um, um, Mom... Oh, no, nothing special. Well, there is one thing. I'm coming up Saturday. Right. Listen, Mom, wait. Uh, what do you think of the name Marie Brewster? Please, sir, I told you before. We don't allow strange men upstairs. I'm not a strange man. I'm a father. Boy, one more and I'll need a bigger apartment. You really have got to learn to pass up a sale. Come in, but watch it. I'm watching. Daddy. Good, you remembered. Uh, Daddy, this is my friend, Judy. Hi, Mr. Marie. We've talked on the phone, remember? Yes. It's a pleasure. Thank you. Uh, you know, Judy's from next door. She's married to Leon. The obstetrician. He's a doctor. Good. All obstetricians should be doctors. Oh. Well, I guess I'd better go and give my obste-doctor husband, uh, breakfast, uh, lunch. Uh, it was really nice meeting you, Mr. Marie. Again, a pleasure. Well, Daddy, come on in. How? That's funny. You know, Mom said, "Never store sweaters dirty." I'll just... Don't bother. I have only one sentence. Oh, Pop, come on in. I'll make you something. You must be hungry. How could I be hungry? Since midnight, I've been eating my heart out. Daddy, will you come on in? I can say what I have to say right here. Short and sweet. I don't want you to change your name, period. Sure, Daddy. I understand. And just come in and we'll discuss it. There is nothing to discuss. Ooh, that's a heck of a... Look, Daddy. Father, I am not a child anymore. We had that discussion when you picked yourself up and left home, Ms. Independence. Could you at least hear the name? It's still ringing in my ears. You see, I used our last name for my first name and the name of our hometown for my last name. I like your last name as your last name and your first name as your first name. And the town can take care of itself. Daddy, I love my real name. It's just not a very good name for an actress. We didn't name an actress, we named a daughter. Wait a second. What's the name of your restaurant? Why, are you planning to change that, too? You don't call it Lou Marie's. No, you call it The Parisienne. Why? Because The Parisienne is a better name for a French restaurant. So? So? Marie Brewster's a better name for an actress. See? It's really the same thing with me and the restaurant. A restaurant does not have a father, or a mother who cried all night. Oh, Daddy, you're not being fair. Fair? I'm not fair? Will you, will you... Wait a second. Not fair? Will you let me fix you a cup of coffee? Why? Well, it's nice to discuss things over a cup of coffee. Right, but we're not discussing anything. You mean, you're just gonna stand there and be stubborn? Wrong. I'm going home. No, Daddy, wait a minute. Now, wait. I just wanna talk about this. What's your name? What do you mean? To Marie Brewster, I have nothing to talk about. With Ann Marie, I'll be a talking encyclopedia. You mean, if I don't do what you say, you won't talk to me? What's your name? It's, it-it's... Now, Daddy, you really mean that? What's your name? Marie Brewster! Oh, Daddy! Daddy! Please, please give me a chance. Come on, up with your hands. All right, cut, cut. All right, that's fine. Lunch, one hour, huh? Hey, Dave, I'd like to talk to you about a couple of things. It's very good. Hey, can I buy you lunch, Ms. Brewster? Hi. Uh, hi. To tell you the truth, I'm too stage-frightened to eat. Now, don't you worry. You're gonna be a smash. What did you tell them at the restaurant so they'd let you off? Oh, I did the wildest thing. I told them the truth. It's always the best thing. How long can you stay away? Forever. They fired me. Huh, like I said, the truth is always the best thing. Come on. Boy, this is some big break. In one shot, I lost a job and a father. Well, look, are you still going up on Saturday? Oh, yeah, my mom's expecting me. Well, suppose I drive you up there? Well, why on earth would you want to let yourself in for that? Well, I-I actually started this name business, and maybe I can talk to him. Besides, you're kind of a special girl. You're kind of a special guy. Daddy. Daddy. Hi. Daddy, you remember Don Hollinger? Hello. What's her name? Oh, Daddy, would you please listen? Well, do you still wanna talk to him? Look, you go see your mom, I'll give it another try. Okay, but don't stand in front of him. He might not stop. Mr. Marie Mr. Marie, please. Mr. Marie, can I just... Mr. Marie, uh, could you turn that down for a second? Okay, it's down. Thank you, sir. I stopped to tell you we have nothing to talk about. But we do, sir. Wrong. You don't know her well enough to ask me for her hand. The weather is terrific. Football, I hate. It's too early for baseball and yes, I think there are people on Mars. Mr. Marie, Ann... That I don't wanna talk about, Mr. Hollingshead. Oh, no. No, no, no. That's Hollinger. Sorry. Well, that's all right. Everybody makes that mistake. So why don't you change your name? Don's a very nice young man, isn't he? Yes, he is. But I don't wanna talk about him, Mom. I wanna talk about me. Oh, you are between you and your father. I'm just, uh, an innocent victim. Can't I talk to anybody in this family? Have some lemonade, huh. Thank you. Look, Mom. You and Daddy raised me well enough to know that I wouldn't intentionally do anything to hurt you or him or anybody for that matter. We also raised you well enough to want everybody to know we raised you. Everybody knows you raised me. Oh? You think people would know that Mr. and Mrs. Marie were the parents of, uh, Marie Brewster or whoever? Look, Mom. There is something more important than just a name involved here. What? Well, we all decided that I was old enough to live alone and make my own decisions. Ann, even the President asks for advice. Well, so do I. I would like advice. But he gives orders and he makes ultimatums, he shouts. When you think someone's getting too far away to hear, you shout. Well? What do you think of the name Hollinger Toledo? You see, Ann, I come from Toledo, and we could use my last name for my first name. Boy, he's rough. Hello? Hi, it's me. How did the taping go? Oh, fine. Are you coming over to watch the show tonight? N-no. Look, I'm sorry, I can't. I have to work, but I'll catch it here at the office. Oh. Some debut. No parents, no you. They're not coming? No. My mother said, "You know your father." Well, I know him, all right. Well, Ann, look. You did what was right, and I'm proud of you. Oh, just a minute. Someone's at the door. For the star. Oh, how beautiful. Thank you, Max. I'll see you later. Don, you are so sweet. Thanks. Oh, they're just beautiful, the flowers. Oh, I'm not so sweet. I didn't send them. Who was sweet? Oh, listen. Blood is thicker than name. Though you're not forgiven, you're not forgotten. And it's signed, "Your father." The armistice. No, just a truce. They're addressed to apartment 2-C, no names. Ann, listen. Why don't you call them? No. You know, I think this really ought to be done in person. "Ms. Independence" is gonna go home and watch the show. Can I use your car? Well, be totally independent and take the train. I'm using my car. Bye. Bye. Not your fault. It's this town. And that's why I'm leaving. Oh, they have such problems. And we're one big, happy family. What's that? I said, we have problems, too. No, I thought I heard something. Ann darling. Mom. Lou, look who's here. Oh, what's her name? Thank you for the flowers, Daddy. You're welcome for the flowers. It's such a pleasant surprise. Well, I didn't wanna watch my debut all by myself. See? Well, um, what about something to eat? Daddy made some tarts. Raspberry. In honor of the occasion. Wait a moment. It's just about to start. Oh? If we find him, the jury will decide. So? She told you she's on later. It's a small part, but very important to the plot. You better hurry. This thing needs something. Hands up, everybody. This is a stickup. Okay, keep moving. When I sneezed before, is that when she was on? She told you she's on later. When, on the eleven o'clock news? Oh, there it is! Look, look. Take a look at the woman. Okay, everybody, down on the floor. There she is. Do as you're told, or you're dead. Please. Uh. You get killed? Yeah. And that's all you're on? Do they at least show your funeral? Daddy. That's all she's on. Well, I said it was a small part. Oh, wait. It's over. I know, but now they'll roll the credits. They'll show your name? Sure. That thrill I can live without. Daddy, please. For please, please. and bang, bang, all this aggravation. - Well, where are you? - At the end, at the end. That's your name. Ann Marie. Lou? Ann Marie? That's me. They made a mistake? No, they didn't, Pop, but I almost did. Why didn't you tell us? Why should a girl have to tell anyone she's using her own name? Get some coffee. Why, uh, why did you do that? Why did you send the flowers? Oh, Pop. I wanted to change my name to help me, not to hurt you. But then I realized it was hurting you so much more than it could ever help me. You were very good in that part. It was little, but you were very good. You really think I was good? Much better than that Marie Brewster would have been. Uh huh. Uh huh. That's great. Yes, she'll be delighted to hear it. W-well, I'm expecting her at any moment. I'll tell her. Fine. Thank you. Bye. Oh. Hello? Hello? Oh, gosh, he hung up. Who was it? It was about you. You're kidding. You got me another part? No, I got your job back at the restaurant. Too late. I'm starting at Macy's in the morning. ♪♪
