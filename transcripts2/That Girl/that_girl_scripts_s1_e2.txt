 Ann moves out of her parents home in Brewster, New York, and moves to New York City to become an actress, though her overprotective father isn't happy about it. Ann meets her neighbor, Judy Bessemer, but doesn't isn't on her own for very long - her mother comes to stay with her because she isn't speaking to Ann's father.

 You are witnessing a scene which, since the beginning of time, has been repeated in all species of the animal kingdom. That moment, when the fledgling tries its wings and flies away from the nest. In all corners of the globe, though the destination of the fledgling may be different, the scene and the motivation is the same: independence.

 This is Manhattan Island, the destination of many modern American fledglings. No matter what they are seeking, young people seem to feel this is the place they can find it. Statistics have shown... I don't care about statistics. I was born one, I'll die one. But in between I am not interested. Lou, you talk as though she's the first girl that ever wanted to go out on her own. I don't care about the first. I just don't want her to be the next. Thousands of girls every year do exactly what Ann's doing.

 I'm not interested in thousands of girls. I'm only interested in... I'm ready. That girl. ♪♪ Well, I think I'm ready. Ann, your new outfit... you look beautiful. Thanks, Mom. Why are you wearing that? Well, 'cause I love it and you bought it for me. Why, what's wrong? Nothing, except you came to us naked. I thought you'd leave the same way. Now, Daddy, don't start again. I'm not starting again. I never stopped. And I won't stop until the ambulance brings you home starving from malnutrition, at which point we'll feed you and say, "I told you so." Daddy... That's your father's way of saying good luck. I'm gonna have it. Look, I've got a great apartment and my agent said he has a part for me already. Everything's going to be just great. Of course, darling. Don't let her fool you. Behind all those, "of course, darlings" is a volcano of tears. You're gonna miss your train. What a tragedy that would be. Daddy, you still wanna take me to the station? No, but I'm taking you. Now, Mom, don't worry. New York is only 40 miles away. I know. I'll call you tonight. Of course, darling. Another "of course, darling." Now, Daddy was just kidding. There won't be any crying, will there? No crying, dear. Aha. And if I'm not back in 20 minutes, start without me. ♪♪ Here it is. Where do you want them? Oh, just add them to the heap. Is there anything else I can do, miss? Well, there are about 4,000 things to do around here, but I could do them all myself. Okay. Oh, I almost forgot. These were in your mailbox. My mailbox? Somebody sent me something already? Oh, they're addressed "To Occupant". Well, that's what you are. That's right. That's what I am. I'm my own occupant. Thank you Mr. Corcoran. You're welcome. Good luck. Thanks. ♪♪ Ahh! There's a mouse... There's a mouse in my house! There's a mouse in my house! That must be Ralphy. Who? Little Billy Nelson lost his mouse last week. Tell him I think I found it. Oh, I will. Listen, I'm Judy Bessemer, your neighbor. Oh, hi. Hi. It's your father. What's my father? I don't know, but he's on the phone. Hello? It is you. Oh no, everything's fine. I was just running to my door because I'm just so excited being in my new house. Why don't you call my phone? Oh, I don't know the number either. I don't even know where it is. There goes Ralphy down the hall. Aaah! Go home to Billy, Ralphy. Oh no, just a couple of kids came by to say "Hi" in the building. Wasn't that sweet? Yeah, I thought it was, too. Does this reach all the way inside? It'll go as far as the window in your bathroom. How do you know that? I was friendly with the couple who lived here before. A-are you a couple? No, I'm a single. I was just talking to my neighbor. Uh huh. How did you know to call her to get me? Boy, Daddy, you are really something. No, don't worry. The minute I find my phone, I'll call mother. Okay. Right. Good. What? He wants to talk to you. Yeah? Hello? Oh, don't mention it. Don't worry, I will. Goodbye. You will what? Remind you to call your mother. If I can find my phone. Is Ralphy the only mouse in the building? As far as I know. Say, how did your father know to call me? Oh, he got your name from the apartment building and then he got your number from information. Boy, what a tricky father. Oh, he's just worried. This is the first time living away from home. I know. When I married Leon, my father went to bed for a week. I guess they're all alike. When my sister, Harriet, wanted to be a model, he practically went into mourning. I wanna be an actress. That would have killed my father. Here it is. Call your mother. You too? I feel responsible. Say, where do you act? Well so far, only at auditions. But tomorrow right after work, I have a very important appointment with my agent about a part. Oh, where do you work? Well, I'm a waitress at Raften's. It's busy. Well, I gotta go now. Hello? Oh, hi. Fine. Okay. I will. Goodbye. That was your father. What do they want now? He said not to call your mother because she just went out so don't call your mother. Oh boy. ♪♪ Hello? Oh hi, Daddy. Fine, fine. Oh yeah, I worked until four o'clock in the morning. Everything's really shaping up great. Mm hm. Listen, Daddy. I'll call you after I see my agent, okay? And I'll tell you all about the part. Oh no, he's sure I'll get it. Okay. Bye. I didn't talk to him that much when I lived there. ♪♪ Come in. Hi. Hi, Harvey. What is it? What's the part? You ready? Yes, yes. What is it? Okay, picture this. I'm sitting at my desk. The phone rings. It's a producer and he says he needs a young actress... Me. Under 5'6". Me, that's me. I say, I got just the girl. Me. You. Oh, Harvey. You're brilliant. What is it? A comedy? A drama? Not exactly. Um, have you ever heard of the, uh... the Merry Moppeteers? Merry Moppeteers? Yeah, it's on every Saturday Morning at 8:00. Oh, it's a children's program? Oh, Harvey! I'd love to do it! I'd love to do a children's show. I'd be perfect. I mean, I can draw and I make faces. I even do puppets. Would they use the puppets? Of course, it's not really acting but, but I've seen some of those nice ladies and they're just great. Oh, Harvey, I'd love to do it. Well, you wouldn't exactly be the nice lady. Um, Auntie Gracie's the regular nice lady. Oh, oh, I would be her assistant? In a way, yes. You see, Ann, she does this real cute thing, uh, with a mop. Oh, I, uh, I push around the mop? No, uh, you'd be the mop. I play the mop? The guest mop... until you prove yourself. But you could get to be the regular mop. Harvey, that's crazy. No, no, Ann. You see, you wear this mop-head costume and you're on like... little rollers. And they push me around and clean up the floor with my head? It's cute, Ann. Real cute. Harvey, I signed with this agency to be an actress, not a household appliance. Oh, that's funny, Ann. That's funny. It's not funny, Harvey. I thought I had a real part. Pays 50 dollars. Fifty? Five-oh. Boy, I could really use that. Let's take it. Okay, Harvey. But you better come up with something better next time. Oh sure, sure. If only I could see the look on my father's face when I tell him my big acting job is being a mop. Hello? Oh hi, Harvey. Yeah, I went over for the fitting this morning. Boy, is that a dumb costume. But I don't care. That 50 dollars is gonna help pay the rent on my own apartment. Oh, no, no, the really lucky thing is they tape Thursday morning. Yeah, so I'll be able to get off from the restaurant. No, actually, I think it's gonna be kinda fun... if I live through it. Oh, Harvey, can I call you back? There's somebody at the door. Okay, bye. Who is it? Mother, hi. Hello, dear. What are you doing here? Oh, did you bring me something? Me. You? I've come to live with you. Ann, you've just done a wonderful job here. Mother, you can't say you're gonna live with me and then casually go about admiring my apartment. What's going on? Why should you get involved? I am standing in my apartment with a mother and a suitcase. I would say that's pretty involved. It'll all be settled as soon as your father apologizes. For what? I don't want to talk about it. Now just go on about your business like I'm not here. Where are you going? If I lie down, maybe the throbbing will go away. Mother! Oh, Miss, we've been waiting a long time. Oh, I'm really sorry. Janet, would do me a favor? I forgot the Garbanzo beans for this table. All right, Ann. Hello? Daddy? No, the Lone Ranger. Daddy, I've been trying to call you since last night. Are you all right? I'm fine. Is she all right? Yes, yes, she's fine. What happened? Didn't she tell you? Well, she says she doesn't wanna talk about it. What happened? I don't wanna talk about it. Well, I do. Daddy, last night, your wife, my mother, slept in my apartment in my bed. Why was she there? Maybe she was tired. Daddy, that isn't funny. Look, don't worry about us. Worry about yourself. Well, I'm worried about me, too. This morning for breakfast, I had cereal, eggs, toast and coffee. Well, what's wrong with that? The cereal, eggs and toast. All I wanted was coffee. But you know mother about food. Your mother is right. Well, if she's so right, then why did you fight? With me, she's not as right as with you. At the moment, she's with me, and I don't think that's right. Does she interfere with your mop rehearsal? Hey, you can just make fun of that if you want, but it's gonna bring in an extra $50 this week. Good, because now you have an extra mouth to feed. Hi, Mom. Hello, Ann. How was your day? Fine, fine. What did you do today? Oh, I read and looked out the window, straightened up a little. Uh. Uh huh. Yeah, looks terrific. Oh, Mother, those drapes belong in the bedroom. I tried them in there, but they really look better here, don't you think? Uh, yeah, I guess they, they really do. How do you like the couch here? Well, nice. What was wrong where it was? Oh, this way, you can look out the window. Uh, oh, never thought of that. Real nice. Listen, Mom, did you and Daddy talk today? There's nothing to talk about. Oh. Oh, by the way, a Harvey Peck called and said that he had gotten the tickets for tonight. Oh, great! Red Letter Sideways. To see that. A play? How nice. Oh, listen, I can go another night. Oh, Ann darling, please understand. As long as I'm here, I want you to do all the things that you normally do when you're alone. Mother, I-I don't know what they are. I haven't had the chance to be alone. I know, and that's a pity. But just act as if I'm not here. Well, see, mother, that's the whole thing. Why is it that you are here? You know, I'm getting a headache. I'm... No, mother, no, you don't. I have seen you do that a thousand times with Daddy. Every time you don't wanna discuss something, boom, instant headache. That's not fair. I was on your side. My side? My side of what? The argument. The argument was about me? Well... Mother? Daddy decided I should come down here and spy on you. Oh. So, you didn't have a fight. You mean you moved in with me because he wanted you to? No, we had a fight because I refused to move in with you. But you moved in with me. Not because he wanted it. Because I wasn't talking to him. Mother, you moved in with me because you had a fight with Daddy about him wanting you to move in with me? Yes. That is the craziest thing I've ever heard. Mother, I want you to get your things and go back to Daddy. Then you think he's right? Yes. Well, no. I mean, I mean, he's wrong. But so are you. I don't know what I think. But in an argument, both people can't be wrong. Well, this one just may break the precedent. Oh, Ann, don't you understand? No, Mom, I don't understand. But I'm gonna try. I really am. I'm gonna take a shower. And as the cool waters envelop and soothe my body, I am really gonna try and understand. Good. I'll fix dinner. What would you like? Anything, Mother, just anything. Mother, where's my bed? Harvey. Is that you? Hey, you look cute, cute. Brush my mop aside, so I can talk to you. Oh, sure. I came down to wish you luck. Thanks. Could you scratch my nose? Oh, sure. Hey, I never did this for a client before. Uh huh. Ugh, not so hard. Hey, is that makeup, or is that bloodshot eye real? Real. I slept on the floor last night. Why? My bed didn't get back from the plumber. Spring's leaking? No, the pipes and the frame were loose, so my mother sent it out to be welded. You know, your old lady sounds like a wacko. She is not. How long is she gonna be around, anyway? I don't think too much longer. Last night, I found out what the fight's all about. Oh, yeah? What was it? If I told you, you'd think my mother was a wacko. Anyway, I'm gonna talk to my father later. We're gonna straighten this whole thing out. Today is Independence Day. Harvey, my mops. You got a lot of guts, kid. Sure, sure. Did you have this much trouble when you left home? No, not a bit. Yeah, with boys, it's different. Especially when they throw you out. You Ann Marie? You're ready for me? No, your mother called. She must have heard us talking. Did she leave a message? Yeah. Maybe you'll understand it. She was out shopping, and she found a "safe bed"? I understand it. Well, she said she'd tell you later, and she'll meet you at the restaurant after work. Harvey... What's the matter? My father's gonna be there, too. Well, you said today was Independence Day. Now, you're gonna have a little fireworks. Ready for the mop. Do you know your lines? Yeah, I think so. Can I make it through the door? Duck under, hon. Duck. Okay. Bye, Harvey. Good luck, honey. Today, we've had a lot of fun. There isn't any more. So take a hold of Molly Mop. And let's clean up the floor. Help! Leave me alone! Ahh! Could have been a big star. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Have you decided? They'll have the number 3, and I'll have the number 5 without the cheese. The Number 5 without the cheese is Number 3. Oh. Why don't you order three number 3's, and save yourself a quarter. Fine, thanks. Don't mention it. Marvelous idea. Then we'll leave that extra quarter as a tip. There you are. I'll just get your coffee in a moment. Coffee, please. That's not my table. But I am your father. Excuse me. Daddy, you're early. I wanted to see how my daughter looked in her working clothes. May I have some coffee? Well, Daddy, there's something I have to tell you. Uh, Miss? One minute. Yes, sir. Our coffee. Yes, sir, coffee right away. Right away, sir. Daddy, there's something I've got to tell you. Your customers come first. Okay, but don't go away. I just got here. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? I have a date with my daughter. So do I. Here you are, Daddy. Mom! Why is she here? Why is he here? Well, you see, what happened is.. Miss, may we have our coffee, please? One second. There you are, sir. Would you give me a hand here? Thank you. There you are. Good. You got everything? Fine. You see, what happened is I didn't know you were both coming. You invited me. Right. I knew you were gonna be here. Then why did you let me come? Well, you were just a message. You can't say no to a message. Actually I'm glad you're both here. Listen, I've got some orders in the kitchen. I'll be right back. Don't go away. Could I have some coffee, please? That's not her table. No, actually Mom's table is my table. Naturally. It really is, Daddy. You can ask the manager. Bring her the coffee. Wait a minute. What happened to your elbow? Oh, one of the kids in that mop thing got a little rough. Oh. See? That's not important. What is important is this crazy fight you had. It was not crazy. It's only the craziest thing I've ever heard. Watch how you talk to your mother. Well, wasn't it crazy? Yes. But watch how you talk to your mother. Miss, where are our sandwiches? Wait. Just hold everything. I'm terribly sorry. I'll get them right away. Janet, Janet. Would you do me a favor? Would you please bring 3 number 3's to this table? Yeah, sure. All right, she'll bring them right away. Thanks a lot. Look, whether it was crazy or not is unimportant. We had weeks of discussion before I left home. And we decided that I could take care of myself. As a mop? Will you forget the mop? How can I? It isn't easy to send a girl to college for 4 years, and have her end up as a mop. Daddy, will you try and understand something? Today I may be a mop. Tomorrow, a garbage pail. But eventually, who knows? I may even get to play people. So, we're not supposed to worry about you? Of course you are. But not as much as you do. I know you and Mom spent a lot of time and energy bringing me up. But now I'm up. Miss! They put cheese on my number 3. Well then, you've got your number 5 after all. Okay. So, you're up. I know it's hard to accept the fact that your child's not a child anymore. We don't think of you as a child. You vote and everything. Of course you think of me as a child. You always will. And I love it. It's just that I don't want you to treat me like one. Okay? Okay. Where you going? We're both going to your apartment. My apartment? To get your mother's things. Wait a minute. What's the matter? You forgot your check. Can't a grown-up lady like yourself buy her poor old parents a cup of coffee? I had to get up in the middle of the night to watch a bunch of kids play Ring around the Rosie. I come on after this game. Do we all get lollipops when it's over? Look, here I come. That's you? That's you? Shh. Shh. Today we've had a lot of fun. There isn't any more. So take a hold of Molly Pop, and let's clean up the floor. Help! Leave me alone! Well, I was pretty good, huh? Oh, you did very well. I don't know. Oh, Daddy. You can't be sad about that silly little part. Who's sad about the part? I'm sad because you missed a dirty spot on the floor. ♪♪ ♪♪
