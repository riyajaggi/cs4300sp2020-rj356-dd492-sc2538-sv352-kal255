 That Girl (1966–1971): Season 1, Episode 5 - Anatomy of a Blunder - full transcript 
 Ann and Donald are planning on having a luncheon picnic en route to Brewster to pick up her hi-fi from her parent's house. This outing will mark the first time Donald will meet her parents, about which he is nervous. He does whatever he can to make what he considers a good impression, which includes wearing his business clothes instead of casual picnic attire. His feelings are valid since her father has always thought any boy she has brought home was not good enough for her. While on their picnic, Donald being in not a very picnicky mood in wanting to preserve his pristine business attire leads to a Murphy's Law of picnics for Donald. Because of such, he wants to postpone their trip to Brewster to meet her parents. But regardless of whether they decide to go to Brewster or head straight back to New York City is easier said than done.

 Oh, Daddy, will you stop worrying? We're gonna stop for a little picnic and we should be there by 2. We'll be fine. Who's we? Don Hollinger. The fellow in the magazine I sent you. And Daddy, since this is the first time you're meeting him... Well, I mean, well you know how you always hate any boy I bring home. If I've hated them, it's because they're dummies. And this Don doesn't look like any exception.

 Quiet now, Lou. What difference does it make whether I'm quiet or noisy? He's still a dummy. Daddy, News View is a highly respected magazine. And Donald Hollinger happens to be one of the most highly respected members of its junior staff. You know, News View doesn't trust just anybody with its typewriters. And I don't trust just anybody with my daughter. Daddy, please. He's driving me up there as a big favor and I think he's nervous about meeting you, anyway. So, so please be nice. I'll be adorable.

 Okay. I'll see you around 2. Love you both. Bye. Goodbye. You have to realize something. She's grown up now. She makes her own decisions. She picks her own friends. Wonderful. She can pick the dummy of her choice. Oh, he's probably a very nice boy. As far as I'm concerned, there isn't a guy in the world who's good enough for that girl. ♪♪ Hi. Hi. Well, I'm here. What are you dressed like that for? Well, my blue suit's in the cleaners. Donald, picnics are usually informal. Yeah, but meeting your folks is no picnic. Will you not think of it as meeting my folks? We are just driving up there to pick up my hi-fi set. And on the way, we're gonna have a really lovely picnic. Yeah. But at the end of that really lovely picnic I'm gonna meet your folks. And that's what I'm dressed for. There is nothing to be nervous about. You're a reporter. You should be used to meeting people. People is not your father. Then pretend he's somebody else, like the President. ♪♪ ♪♪ Wait, oh it's beautiful. Oh, is this pretty. Oh, Donald, it's just gorgeous. I told you we'd find some. Oh, look. There's an adorable little stream. Oh, come. It's so beautiful. We can just put our feet... Oh, Donald, it's adorable. Okay, wait. Wait a minute. Bring the basket. Wait. All right, wait a minute. Oh, it's just great. Look how pretty it is up here. There's so, so many weeds. Oh, I love it. Oh look, Donald, isn't it great? Yes, yes. Okay. Oh come on. Come on around this way. Come on before the sun goes down. Wait a minute. There's weeds in my pants. Oh, Donald, look how pretty this is. Yes, it's beautiful. Oh, aren't you glad we came here? Wait a minute there's, look it's all dirt. There's no grass there, Ann. We'll get all filthy. What do we need grass when there's this darling little stream. Look, we can put our toes in there right after. Oh, okay, okay. Put down the basket. Okay, it's beautiful, it's beautiful. Oh, I love it. Let's eat, please. Let's eat. Donald, it's more fun if you're gonna have a picnic-y attitude. Oh, we'll go on lots of picnics. I know. But none of them will be the first. Well, well how do you want to remember our first picnic? Just sitting around eating chopped liver sandwiches? Oh, you have chopped liver? Come on. Let's go wade in the stream. Oh, no. Come on, Donald. Oh, I love it. Come on in. No, no, my pants. I'll get my pants wet. I guarantee you the water is lint-free. Come on, this is silly. Look. Come on, Don. Come on. Come on out. Come on, Don. You come and get me. Come and get me. Ann, that's silly. Come on. You're a child, Ann. You know that, don't you? I always am when I'm on a picnic. Oh. Oh, Ann, I... Don't threaten. All right, all right. Oh, it's so good. What's so funny? Oh, Donald. I've never seen your ankles before. My ankles are not funny. That's 'cause you're used to 'em. Come on, aren't you coming in? Yeah, but if I meet your folks with clammy pants it's your fault. Oh. Ah! Ah! Oh, Donald, you're being so funny. What are you doing? You're sillier than me. I stepped on a bee. Oh, Donald. I'm so sorry. Oh, Donald. Does it hurt? Well, I know it hurts, Donald, but what do I say to a person who just screamed? Well you could call me stupid. Nobody but me is stupid enough to step on a bee. You're not stupid. Bees don't belong on the ground. Well he was there. Then he was stupid. Well look, anyway we can forget about seeing your folks. Just because of one little bee sting? No, because of one big swollen foot. I mean, what's your dad gonna think when I come hopping up to the house on one foot? He isn't gonna think anything. You can just stay off the grass. Ann. Donald, you're just using this bee sting so you don't have to meet my parents. Yeah, you're right. You're right. I always carry a kamikaze bee for just such occasions. Donald, please. Please. Oh, okay, okay. All right, I'll go. Good. You know you said you want to remember our first picnic. I know I will. Poor Donald. Oh, Donald, it's so pretty up here. Mm hm. You know we couldn't have picked a better place. Hey, you got another sandwich? You like 'em? I love chopped liver. It's my own recipe. Well, not that I cook my own liver or anything. It's just that I put in a little extra dash of vinegar, and a little extra dash of mayonnaise. Mm hm. Well, what I think really gives it the zing is the horseradish. Hmm. Horseradish? Yeah, that's the real secret of great chopped liver. Well, why did you keep it a secret? Why, what's the matter? Well, I'm allergic to horseradish. It gives me bumpy blotches all over my face and it makes me wheeze. Oh, Ann I... I-I can feel myself blotching now. Oh, Donald, it's happening all in your mind. But it's also under your skin. Am I breaking out bad? Well, let's see. There's just about 10 little bumps over there and about 13, 14 over there. Oh, Ann. Donald, why didn't you tell me you were allergic to horseradish? Well, it's not the sort of thing you say when you're going out with a girl. You look lovely, my dear. I'm allergic to horseradish. Donald, I'm sorry. Why, if you only had told me, I could have used... Why did you hit me in the face? Because you, you put your face where your back was. I'm sorry, Donald. Ann, I have another revelation for you. I wear contact lenses. Why? Well, because they're more comfortable than regular glasses. You wear glasses? No. No, contact lenses. Gee, you can't even tell. That's because when you slapped me, you knocked them both out. No, no, no stop. Now, don't move. You might step on them. You're right. If that crunch under my right foot meant anything. Oh, no. You, you broke my contacts, Ann. You broke my contacts. Contact. Contact, Donald. I only broke one. Okay, look. Let's look for the other lens. Okay, now. When, when the lens came out I was facing this way on the blanket, right? Yes, you were. You were lying right here. Oh, where? Wait a minute. So then it should be in this area somewhere, right? Right, right. Okay. All right. Okay, just somewhere in this area. Slow. Okay, slow. You know, Donald, as long as we've been going out together I never dreamed you wore contacts. You know, listen, there's no telling how far it flew though. Not that it makes any difference. It's just that you never know a person as well as you think you do. Hey, maybe it rolled into the stream. I never dreamed you'd be afraid to meet my parents. Donald, I just think it's strange that two people who really think they know each other don't know each other at all. W-well, does it change anything that I have an allergy and I wear contacts? Of course it doesn't. I mean, all those little imperfections are just more to love. You can't love somebody who's perfect. Gee. Well, I'm glad neither one of us is perfect. Why? What's wrong with me? Oh, nothing. Oh no, Donald. You just said it's a good thing neither of us is perfect. So what's wrong with me? Nothing. Oh, no, no, Donald. Let's get it out right now. Let's get it right out in the open. Come on, Donald. What is it? All right, all right. Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, uh-hmm. Well sometimes when you get a little excited your, your voice gets all crazy and squeaky. Oh. That's not bad. Okay. Well, wait a minute. There's more. Oh, no, no. Thanks a lot. That's about as imperfect as I want to be. Look, Ann, I don't want your folks to meet a blotchy man with a swollen foot. And we're never gonna find that other lens, and I'd like to recognize your folks in case I ever see them again. Look, Donald, they'll understand. Ann, Univac wouldn't understand. We are going back to the city. You let the littlest things bother you. Where is she? They should have been here an hour and a half ago. Hmm, what's an hour and a half to her? She was 3 days late when she was born. It's just not like Ann. What do you expect? Running around with that bum. She's not running around. And you don't know he's a bum. He's an hour and a half late with my daughter, isn't he? All right, Donald, keep your foot up. Don't, don't use your foot. I'm trying not to. Oh. Ow. Ow. Almost there. Now be careful. Be careful. Here we go. I'll help you. Ow. Just give me your foot. Ann, now... Give me your foot. Just give me your foot. Ann. You're gonna break that... All right, Don. Get away, get away. You're gonna break my leg. Oh, here. Okay, I've got your shoe. I've got your shoe. Ann, look, look, you better drive. Everything's a little fuzzy to me. Okay. Get in. Okay. Don't push, don't push. Careful you don't bump your foot. Remember your foot. Remember my foot. Okay. Now wait. Ahh. Ow. But it was a pretty spot. Okay. Are you okay? I'm okay. Just start the car. All right. Oh Donald, I'm sorry. Something's the matter with the car. I can't get it into gear. Why'd they have to give you such a crazy car for? Ann, Ann, it was the only loaner they had. You don't even have the clutch in all the way. The clutch? Yeah, the thing you... You don't know that thing you push? This isn't automatic shift? Ann, not with the clutch. Well, well, I've never driven anything but automatic. I've never clutched in my life, Donald. You have never driven... Oh. Well, look, never mind, never mind. Okay, what do I do? Look, it's very, it's very simple. All you have to do is press your left foot against the left pedal. Yeah, that's it. That's the clutch. Okay. Well, it's clutched. All right, all right. Now, put it in first gear. First gear? There's more than one gear? Ann, cars without automatic transmissions have three gears. Except cars like this one, which have four. Well, look, never mind, never mind. You just push in the clutch. I'll shift. Okay. Okay. All right. Now what? Now, now let out the clutch, and we're on our way. All right. Okay. Sorry, Donald. Okay. Okay, now we're gonna try that again. Only this time, Ann, just let the clutch out a little more slowly. All right, what will I do? You start it. Start it again. Okay. Okay now. See how simple? Now we're, we're gonna be on our way again. Just let the clutch out. Ease it out slowly. Ooh, I'm gonna ruin your loaner. Well, not if you'll just ease out the clutch. Okay. Ease it out. Slowly, ease it out. I'm sorry. I told you I couldn't drive a car with two pedals. No, no, no. Nope, you made great progress. Ten feet in ten minutes. Well, it's your fault. First you tell me to put the clutch in then out, then in. Talk about women changing their mind. You know, it suddenly occurs to me, we're facing a bigger problem. We're stranded. We are not stranded. Ann, I can't see and you can't drive. Now I call that stranded. What we need to do is get some help. Ooh, I'll call the Auto Club. How? Well, on their number. Well, how are we gonna call? Well, see we'll just drive to a phone booth, and if we could drive to a phone booth we wouldn't have to call. Don't worry. She probably decided not to come. No, she would have called. How could she call if that bum ran off with all her money? She doesn't need money to call from her own phone. Bum probably took that, too. Oh, Lou. Will you calm down? They stopped for a picnic, right? They're having so much fun she probably forgot about the time. Maybe the bum stole her watch. Ann, what are you doing? Shh. I've got my ear to the ground to see if I can hear any cars coming. I don't hear any. Ann, listen. That only works when you press your ear against the railroad track to see if a train's coming. Oh. Well, I don't hear any trains coming either. Well, it may be stupid, Donald, but it's a heck of a lot better than just sitting. Ann, listen, listen. Why don't we go back to where we first had the picnic and really scour the place until we find my other lens? Okay. Okay? Ow. Listen, ow, you think you'd be able to find the exact place where we had the, where we had the picnic? I think so. I'll just look for a dead bumblebee. Ow. Donald. Donald, what's the matter? Oh, my good foot hurts. I must have a rock in my shoe. Ooh, stop, don't move. What? Sn-snake? A hunch. I know it, I know it. I just betcha. What? Ha ha. It wasn't any ordinary pebble. That's your lens. My lens! How did it get in my shoe? You had your shoes off, remember? I must have knocked it right in. There. You're fuzzy. Oh? Oh, it's just a little lint from the blanket. No, no, no. I mean, it's the lens. I-I, it's in the wrong eye. How can you tell which lens goes in which eye? I mean, with glasses, they're fixed together. But how can you tell which contact lens belongs in which eye? You can't. That's why I just put the right lens in the left eye. There, I can see. I can see. What's so funny? You look like Keiser Wilhelm. I don't care who I look like. I can see now. So I will now drive us back to New York City where I will try and blot this entire miserable day from my mind. Donald, now that you can see again, why don't we just go up to my parents? It's just a couple of miles from here. Ann, look at me. Look at this blotchy, miserable, limping, one-eyed man. They'll understand. Ann, can you look at me square in my good eye and tell me they'll understand? They will understand. They understood Ronald Hickey. Who is Ronald Hickey? This boy I used to date. Oh, never mind. They didn't really understand Ronald. Now look, Ann. If I could, if I could I'd put my foot down. We are going back to the city. Okay. They'd understand. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. How can I drive? With one eye, you don't have any depth perception. I-I wouldn't know if I'm running off the road once I turn. What will we do? Well, look, if I go slow enough, maybe, maybe 10 miles an hour... Yeah, that will be safe enough. Donald, I don't like safe enough. You can tell me when I'm close to going off the road. You can tell me when to turn. You'll be my eyes. But I flunked out as your clutch. Ann, we can't just sit here. Why don't we just go up to my parents? That's only a few miles and there's no traffic. Ann, we are going back. Now, you, you just say left or right depending on which way I should turn this car, okay? Ow! Oh, Donald. Donald, what is it? What is it? Oh, when I work the clutch it hurts my bee sting. Oh, poor Donald. I can be your eyes. I just wish I could bear your pain. Well, it sounded good when a girl once said it to John Wayne in "Flying Leathernecks". Right, left. Ow, ow. Ow! Oh, Donald, I'm sorry. It really hurts, okay. Okay, okay. Yeah, but just real slow, real gentle, real gentle. Ow. Ow. Okay now, left now. Left, left, left, left. No, right, right, right. I think the phrase is, "Well, Stanley, another fine mess you've gotten us into." You turned too much. I said a teensy bit to the right. I turned a teensy bit to the right. No, Donald. You turned a shade. A shade to the right. A shade is quite a bit more than a teensy. I turned what I considered to be a teensy. Oh well, if you turned a teensy we wouldn't be in this ditch right now. Ann. Ann, you and I are gonna have to learn to communicate. And perhaps the best step in that direction is total silence on your part. Oh. Does that mean you're gonna be your own eyes from now on, too? I'll be my own eye. Eye. We can get out of here. You think we can? I don't know why we should expect to. Oh. Now what's wrong? Nothing really. I hear mud's good for bee stings. Well? Well, it's like I figured. We're stuck in the mud. You think we'll be able to get out? I don't know. We can try. But look, you'll have to drive. Oh, Donald. One of us has to drive and one of us has to push. If it's multiple choice, I'll drive. Now look, what we have to do is take it slow and easy, and there's a good chance we can get out. Now what you have to do is ease out the clutch very slowly. Very slowly. Right. Now, okay, start the car. Okay. Hold on. Oh, okay now. Okay, now as you ease out the clutch please just give it a little gas. Just a little gas, okay? Okay, a little gas. Okay. Okay now. All right, wait... All right. Any time. Oh, Donald, I gave it just a little gas. Maybe you meant a teensy-weensy? Lou, it's getting dark. It happens every day about this time. Bum. Think we should call the police? What am I gonna tell the police? That I want to report a missing daughter and a missing bum? I'm worried. You're doing a marvelous job of hiding it. Huh. How do I look? All right? Wait a minute. That's a police car. Huh. No. Don't worry, there's Ann. Oh. And there's a cop. And there's a bum. Oh, Daddy. Daddy, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm so glad you're all right. Everything's fine. Uh, Mom, Dad, I want you to meet Officer Barner. What's he doing here? Well, everything's all right. I want you to meet Donald. Don? Don? This is Donald. Lou, it is a bum. Donald, come upstairs. You can clean up. I'll show you where you can wash. Now don't worry. I'll be right back. I can explain everything. I dare you. And so, Donald said, "Take over the wheel," which I did. He said give it a little bit of gas. Which I did, give it a little bit of gas. And the mud got all over him. He looked funny. And if that policeman hadn't come along right then and given us a lift, we'd still be there. At least you weren't hurt... uh, seriously. I want to thank you again for the clothes, Mr. Marie. I feel so stupid. I really wanted to make an impression. Oh, you did. You impressed me as sort of a dirty Keiser Wilhelm. Daddy. Don't worry, I don't hate him. How can I hate anybody with such rotten luck? But it was all my fault. Well, look, I want you to know that I'm really not as dirty and stupid and clumsy as I, as I look like I am. Forget it. Have some dip. Thank you, sir. Well, it was just an accident. I mean an accident could happen to anybody. Look, I'm glad it was an accident. For a minute I thought he had crazy eating habits, too. I-I, I'm sorry. It's not one of your better days, is it, lad? Well, now wait a minute. All of you, please. But Daddy, you don't have to hold the bowl. ♪♪ OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
