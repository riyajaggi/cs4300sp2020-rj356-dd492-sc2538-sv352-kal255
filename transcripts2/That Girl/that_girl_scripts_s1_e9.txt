 That Girl (1966–1971): Season 1, Episode 9 - Time for Arrest - full transcript 
 An embarrassed Ann is arrested and in jail while wearing only a revealing leopard skin cave woman outfit. Despite she not wanting any of her friends or family to know her situation, she nonetheless calls Donald for help, he who jumps to all sorts of conclusions once he sees her behind bars wearing what she's wearing, and because she broke their date that evening telling him she was too tired to go out. However, Ann still isn't certain why she's in jail. The story... After breaking her date with Donald, Ann received an urgent plea from her friend Margie to fill in for her at work, a nightclub called The Cave whose theme is a prehistoric cave. Despite her reluctance, Ann was forced to wear the revealing costume for the job or else Margie would end up losing her job. Seeing her apprehension about wearing the costume in front of many people, Al Morgenthaler, one of Margie's boss' associates, gets Ann transferred from working the coat check to working the more intimate private dining room. Ann learns she was arrested for the goings-on in the private dining room that evening, most specifically between Morgenthaler and another man named Eddie Parelle, both who are not what they represented to Ann. Ann has to balance telling the police any important information she overheard at that gathering against her fear that Morgenthaler, Parelle or any of their thugs might come after her for being a snitch. Nonetheless, it's the seemingly salacious but purely innocent details of the story that embarrass Ann.

 ♪♪ Now look, I don't know why I'm back here. Like I told you before, we was only playing for matchsticks. They don't count as matchsticks when you can cash 'em in for a hundred bucks. Sergeant, money don't mean nothin' to me. It was just a friendly neighborhood game. In a garage? Why don't you just make a statement, Joey? I ain't doin' nothin' 'til I talk to my lawyer. All right. You can talk to him.

 After we finish booking him. Tom. All right, Yorkie. Who's next? Over there, Sergeant. That girl. ♪♪ Miss Ann Marie, according to the law you're allowed to make one telephone call. Who do you wanna call? No one. Absolutely no one. Look, lady. You're in trouble. So you'd better think of someone. Do you have a lawyer? Well, I've never needed one before.

 Well, you need one now. If you don't have a lawyer, call your parents. My parents? Are you kidding? You don't know my father. He'd kill me if he saw me like this. And my mother'd start screaming... All right, all right. We'll discuss your family some other time. Right now I've got people to book, so make a decision. Who do you wanna call? Well, there's only one person left... that's my boyfriend. Good. But I can't call him. Lady. You see, he'd never understand. Lock her up again, Yorkie. No, wait... that's okay. Uh, uh, I'll call. Uh, excuse me. My name is Donald Hollinger. Just wait your turn with the others. No, you don't understand. I got a message to meet someone here. Miss Ann Marie? Donald. She... well, she's probably at your Lost and Found Department. Donald. Something like that. Donald. Donald. Ann! Uh, excuse me, I think I just found her. What are you doing here? I'm in jail. Did you get the message? The message said meet you at the jail. It didn't say in it. Well, you see... We're in it, all right, but we had a ball getting here, didn't we, hon? Uh, Don, this is Martha. Uh, uh... Hi. Would you tell me what you're doing here? Give me a chance. I am. What happened to you? Doll, I'm leaving. Can I have my coat back? Oh, sure. Thanks a lot. What is that? Well... Well, what is it? What is that? It's nothing. Will you just be quiet? Ann, look, would you mind stepping over here, please? Over here. All right now, Ann. Explain. I explained about last night. I was too tired to go to the movies. Too tired, but you weren't too tired to run around town in a leopard skin. The leopard skin has got nothing to do with it. Yeah. Yeah, I know. It's the exposed part you were arrested for. I was not arrested for that. Then what were you arrested for? I don't know exactly. Ann, how can you not know? If you're not gonna give me a chance to explain, I don't want to talk about it. It's pretty sad when a person can't discuss a little thing like this without becoming nasty. A little thing? Like getting arrested in a leopard skin? I have a perfectly logical explanation for everything if you'll just listen. All right. All right, I'm listening. Okay. Remember I was too tired to go to the movies? Right after we hung up, I started doing my ironing. I was ironing that scarf, the one with all the states on it? And I was just getting the wrinkles out of Idaho, when... Who is it? It's me, Margie. Oh, hi, Margie. Come in. Oh, I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, but I've been trying to call you. Your phone's been busy for an hour and 28 minutes. Oh, I'm sorry. I was talking to Don. Hey, aren't you supposed to be working tonight? Well, uh, yeah. Ann, could I ask a favor? Sure. What is it? Well, you know that new show "Lollipops and Onions"? Uh huh. Well, one of the girls is leaving the show and they want me to audition for one of the onions. Hey, that is great! I know, but I have a problem. The audition is tonight. And I have to find someone to fill in at my regular job, so in case I don't get the part I still have my regular job. Margie, I'd love to help you out but that phone call from Don? Yes. Well, we're having our date over the phone. I told him I was too tired to go out. So I really couldn't. He doesn't have to know. Oh, I really have a great chance to get this part. Isn't there anybody else you could get? I've tried everybody. Ann, it's just for one night and you'll make $25. $25? Maybe 30 if the tips are good. Gee, $30. Don's birthday is next week. I'd love to get him something nice. Then you'll do it? Okay. Yay! Oh, it's called The Cave. Just be there by 8 and ask for Lou. Be there at 8 and ask for Lou? What do I tell him about you? Just tell him anything. Except the truth. The Cave. She was desperate, Donald. And as her friend, I really had no choice. So Margie's sick? Yes, she is, sir. You mean she's got a date? Oh no, sir. She's very sick. Aw, come on. No, no, really. She's all hot and puffy and she has a very high temperature, too. That's great. We'll have to go out and hire another girl till she gets back. No, she'll be back tomorrow. I mean, the doctor said she might recover fast. She's a very strong girl, you know. Anyway, you're here. Can you check coats? I-I think so. Yeah, you can check coats. Go down and see Martha. Martha? Yeah. She's your cave mother. Are you the kid that Lou sent? Oh, yes. Yes, I am. Let's see now. This... let me see. This nice new one oughta be just the right one for you. This one ought to fit you. What is that? That's your costume. Where's the rest of it? You're the rest of it. I can't wear that. You have to. It's a rule. They make all the girls wear it. They don't make you wear it. They did until a couple of years ago. But then they started getting complaints. Don't you think they'd make an exception? I'm only here for one night. Well, it's part of the motif, hon. You're just lucky you didn't work here last year. Why is that? This place was called The Birthday Suit. I just can't wear this thing. Well, then, you'll have to go talk to Mr. Lou. And let me hold your purse for you. You go and see him now. Okay. Thanks. I just got word. Eddie's on his way. Big deal. It is, Al. A very big deal. You and Eddie getting together again. Yeah. Come in. Ah, Mr. Lou. Can't you see I got company? Well, it's about this. If it don't fit, tell Martha to get you another one. Oh, no, no, it fits. Well, I really don't know whether it fits or not. It's just, well... Lou, I can't wear this. What do you mean you can't wear it? Well, I can but I-I-I don't want to. All the other girls wear them. High class girls, too. Well, well, well, it's so bare. Uh... couldn't I wear something with it? Like what? Well, uh, like... like my coat. Hey, that's a great idea! See, I have on my coat and all the other people would know where to take their coats. Look, you put it on, or your friend is out of a job. Hey, what's wrong with the costume? You're gonna look beautiful in it. Maybe. I've just never worn anything like this before. Yeah, but it's part of your work, ain't it? Well, sort of. I... You think I'm crazy about these clothes? Well, they're very nice. What's wrong with them? Nothin'. But I'd much more rather be wearin' Bermuda shorts or a Cubavera jacket. But I wear these 'cause it's part 'n parcel of my work. Oh. What kind of work do you do? I'm a legitimate businessman. What business are you in? I'm a furrer. You mean, a furrier? That's it. A furrier. Yeah, I get your point, Mr... Morganthaler. Mr. Morganthaler. But you see, this really isn't part of my work. I'm just filling in for a friend. Oh, you go to school or something? Well no, I'm a... I mean I want to be an actress. Oh, so you wanna be an actress, huh? Yes. Well, that's very good. I adore the show business. I used to be in it. Oh really? What did you do? Before I went into the army I was a "corrographer". Oh. That's real nice. And you're nice. Hey, Lou. She's a good kid. Why don't you put her in with us in the private dining room where she won't be so embarrassed? I'll call you back. Well, all right. But you gotta do coats until we can find someone to do coats for you. Thank you. Thank you so much, Mr. Lou. And thanks a lot too, Mr. Al. Ah, don't mention it. Ann, if any guys gets fresh with you in the "interdom", just tell Al, huh? Okay. Thanks. Ah! How's it going? Oh, it's... it-it's going fine. Just fine. And not too good, eh? No. Well, don't worry. I got you transferred to the private dining room. Oh, did you? Oh thanks, Mr. Al. Oh, what about this? We found a replacement. It'll be like old times. Wasn't that a nice thing for Mr. Morganthaler to do? Yeah, but you still haven't told me why you were arrested. Well, I'm getting to that. Well, get to it. This way please. Where am I going? For some questioning. Ann, come here. Wait a minute. Just cover up. Miss Marie? Yes, sir. I'm Lieutenant Silvestri. Sit down, please. Thank you, sir. Uh, this is Donald Hollinger. How do you do, Sir. How do you do. He was my one call. I beg your pardon? Well, you know, when you get one call and usually call a lawyer? Well, Donald was the one I called. I see. Miss Marie, I'd like to ask you a few questions about what happened at The Cave. Uh, L-lieutenant, is-is Ms. Marie in trouble? I'll know that better after I question her. We're interested in what you know about Al Morganthaler. Oh, Mr. Morganthaler. Well, he's a very nice man. Is he? Yes, he is. And he's very considerate. And he was very thoughtful and very protective of me while I was at The Cave. What do you know about him? Well, um, I know that uh, he's a furrier now, and during the army, he was a choreographer. He also happens to be one of the most notorious underworld figures in this country. Oh, well, he never mentioned that. You mean the man that was nice to her is 'Big Al' Morganthaler? The same. How do you know about him? Well, I once wrote an article on crime in the United States. You're a reporter? Yes. Yes, with Newsview Magazine. Well, this is strictly off the record, understood? Oh, of course. I'm not here as a reporter. I'm here as Miss Marie's friend. He won't tell anybody. All right. Now, Miss Marie... let's get back to Mr. Morganthaler. He certainly didn't seem like a criminal. Number-three man in the syndicate. You mean he's not a furrer? Uh, A furrier? Yes, he has a fur business but that's just a front. Yeah, that's the way all those big hoods operate. Miss Marie, we're particularly interested in his relationship with another man at that party, a Mr. Perrel. The florist. Yes, he's a florist and he makes a lot off his own trade. You mean he goes out and hires killers? No. Whew. He keeps them on staff. I just can't believe it. That's the way it is. Yeah, honey. That's the way it is. Please try and think. Well, I am. I-I'm really trying. You see, they... they did look a little tough but they all seemed like nice men except for the bartender. The bartender? Yeah. Yeah, he was a big burly guy with black hair and big, bushy eyebrows. Dobbs. One of the big ones. No, one of us. Oh, I'm so sorry. That's okay. Oh, well if you know him, why don't you ask him what happened? Well, we have his report. We want additional information. Miss Marie, were you aware of the purpose of this get-together? Yes, I was. It was for drinks and dinner. Who are you kidding, Miss Marie? You've been around. A girl doesn't check hats at a joint like The Cave without knowing the score. E-excuse me, Lieutenant. She was just filling in for her girlfriend. What is the score? Drinks and dinner were just a front. Actually, the real purpose of that meeting was to discuss a merger between the criminal empires of Morganthaler and Perrel. Wow. Really, it was a reconciliation rather than a merger. You see, they used to be partners. Perrel thought he was getting the short end. Oh... yeah. Now it all makes sense. What does? Well, the way they talked to each other. Take this down. Take what down? Anything you heard or saw could be important. You mean to say you want me to birdie? I mean, chirp? Don, what do they call you when you tell on criminals? Dead. Anything you tell us will be kept in strict confidence. Well, I-I really don't know anything. I mean, I shouldn't have been there in the first place. You're under arrest, Miss Marie. Now, if you wanna get out of here, you'll talk. Um, um, honey... honey, talk. Go ahead, talk. Well, uh, I'll try and remember. I think Mr. Morganthaler was being very nice to Mr. Perrel, but Mr. Perrel wasn't being very nice to Mr. Morganthaler. Hey, hey, what's going on here? Come on, you gentlemen. Drink up. Drink up. The champagne is gonna flow like a river. Come on. I'm picking up the tab. You could afford to be thirsty. Archie. Come on, boy. How are you? Hey, Lou. Come on, come on. We're gonna have a great, repast. Come on. Get up an appetite. It'll relieve the tension. Eddie, Eddie, you haven't changed a bit, Eddie. You look just as good as you used to look. Thanks, Al. It's been a long time since we've seen each others, Eddie. A long time. November '57, wasn't it? That's right. How many years is that? A long time. Well? That's it. Oh, uh, yes. Thank you. And, uh... Here we are, gentlemen. That was a, uh, a Bourbon on the Rocks. That's right. And then this is a Whiskey Sour. Here you are, Sir. And, uh, a Scotch and Soda for you. Thank you. And a beer. Just like old times, Eddie. Me with my Scotch and Soda and you with your beer. What do you mean by that, Al? Oh nothing, Eddie. Just like old times, that's all. Would you like an hors d'oeuvre? They're just delicious. Oh, thank you. We never really had much in common, did we Al? Aww... Aww, what are you talking about, Eddie? What are you talkin'? We were kids, like that. Remember the old baseball team with me pitchin' and you catchin'. That's what I mean, Al. You're always pitchin' and I'm always catchin'. Oh. Come on, Eddie What's the difference? It's the team that counts as long as we get together. Do you think we could ever get together? Like oil and water. Miss Marie, we know all that. You do? Yes, we got it from Dobbs. He was there during the cocktails. Oh, that's right. Well I... I wish I could be more help. I wish you could, too. Did anything happen during dinner? Any detail you can remember no matter how insignificant. Well, there was one thing. What was that? A man named Lefty. Lefty Valen, one of Morganthaler 's henchmen. Go on. Well, right before the first course, Lefty moved from the middle of the table down to the end right next to Mr. Morganthaler. Yeah, yeah. That's what I want. Now what did he say? It must have been something important. Uh huh. He said the he was left-handed and that he didn't want to bump elbows during dinner because of it. Uh, uh, they don't want to hear about that. Well, he said "anything important." You never can tell. Did they discuss business at all? Just their fronts. Huh? Furs and flowers. Did they argue about anything? Yes, they did. They argued about the shrimp. Benny "The Shrimp". No, the shrimp cocktail. You see, Mr. Perrel wanted the red sauce, where then again, on the other hand, Mr. Morganthaler wanted the tartar sauce. Miss Marie, we are not getting anywhere at all. Well, you said anything could be important, and I-I'm just... I know, I know, I know. Let's forget that for the moment, uh... Tell us what happened between dinner and the time you came out of the cake. Well... The cake? Uh, now, Donald. You-you mean you came out of one of those cakes-like one of those... I did not. Will you stop that? It wasn't anything like that all. Well, can you tell us what started the fight? Well.. The fight? Donald. Actually, the fight had nothing to do with the cake. No, actually it began earlier. It was right after the main course. I'm finished. Ann, what's for dessert? Oh, well, there's this lovely Nesselrode Pie, Mr. Al. And we also have strawberry tarts. I'll take the Nesselrode. Yeah, I like that... Yeah. Why not. All right. That'll be six Nesselrode pies. Here you go. Here you are, Sir. Here. Now, Mister Perrel? Strawberry Tart. Boys? Delicious. Sounds good. I like strawberry tart. Six of them. Oh, well I'm afraid there's a little problem. What problem? Well, you see, we only have five strawberry tarts, but we have a lot more Nesselrode Pie. We don't want no "Nesselroth" Pie. Well, it's very good. Why don't you take a look at it? You mean that? With the crust and the filling? Uh huh. I hate it. Well, maybe one of your friends would like it. Nah, they hate it, too. Right? See? Mr. Perrel... It's a matter of principle: If his boys get what they want, so do mine. Well, uh, maybe I could run right out and get it. Why should we have to wait? Well, it'll only take two minutes. I'll be right back. Don't bother. You planned this didn't you, Al? Eddie... You did. Eddie, would I hold a reunion just to hang you up over a lousy strawberry tart? That's what I'm askin' you, Al. Eddie, if I had known, I would have bought a hundred strawberry tarts. I would have bought a whole tree full of strawberries. I don't buy all that, Al. It was a crummy mistake. You're only one short. Ah, that's the way it was when we split up the business, only then I was one city short. Eddie... Al, that strawberry tart and Cleveland, they are the same thing. Oh, let's skip the dessert. I got a great big surprise for you. Bring on the surprise! ♪♪ And I have a little surprise for you, Al. Okay, boys... What's going on out there? There's a fight. What are you doing in here? I'm Miss Friendship, the spirit of harmony and goodwill. I have to come out when I hear a whistle. Oh. How long are they going to fight? They didn't say. I'm over cramped. Yeah, I guess you are. How long have you been in here? Half an hour. Half an hour? I guess you know how John Glenn felt. Who? John Glenn. The astronaut? Oh yeah, I think I heard about that. It was in all the papers. Can you see anything? Nothing much. I hope they're almost finished. I don't think they are. How can you tell? All I can see is feet. If they were almost done I think we'd see some bodies. There's my signal. ♪♪ It's time for friendship... Bring her out! What's going on up here? Oh, uh... Her too. And that's everything I know. All right, Miss Marie. All right what? It's like I figured. They were on the brink of a merger, and both being hotheads, it blew up in their faces before it could happen. Oh. Well, I'm sorry I couldn't be more help. Oh, don't worry about it. At least we know the merger won't take place, thanks to the fight... and that strawberry tart. Well, if the fight prevented the merger, then I was a lot more help than I thought. How's that? Will you promise not to tell anybody? I ate the tart. Well, what's going to happen to me now, Lieutenant? You're free to go. Goodnight. Lieutenant, will this be on her record? No, we'll wipe the whole thing clean. Thank you, Sir. That's very nice of you. Don't mention it. Be a smart girl. Stay away from The Cave. We have to go back there. What for? I didn't get paid. They'll mail it. But what about my leopard suit? Ah, you can mail that... in a small envelope. ♪♪ OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
