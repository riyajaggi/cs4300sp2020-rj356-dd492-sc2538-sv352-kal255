 That Girl (1966–1971): Season 1, Episode 6 - Rich Little Rich Kid - full transcript 
 While waiting in line to dispute a traffic ticket, Ann meets Roddy Waxman who is also in line to deal with his traffic infraction. Although she knows it is a pick-up line (since he says it isn't one), Ann decides to be the good Samaritan and help Roddy, whose drivers license is suspended and needs someone to drive him and his car home, when she learns that that car is a Rolls Royce. Wealthy Roddy is tenacious in his pursuit of Ann, some of which she can't avoid, while other instances she can. Donald isn't jealous until he learns that Ann isn't sure if she will say no to any of Roddy's continual requests for dates. Donald's case is not helped when he finds out that Roddy has theater connections and accuses Ann of having an ulterior motive in perhaps wanting to date him. But after Donald figures he still wants Ann as his girlfriend, he fights in the only way he thinks he can win, and that is by being like Roddy in lavishing Ann with monetary acts of affection. In the end, Ann will have to choose if the champagne and caviar life from someone to who it is second nature is more appealing than life in the hot dog set with someone for who she already has great affection and whose gifts actually mean something.

 ♪♪ Have you ever heard of anybody contesting a traffic fine and actually winning? No, but you came pretty close. Illegal parking, fire hydrant. That's what it says, but it's not true. It never is. It's great the way a person is pushed around on this... Legal assembly line? Thank you. This legal assembly line. I happen to be a victim of injustice.

 So am I, lady. I ain't had my coffee yet. It's just not fair. That car was a good... How far should you be from a hydrant? Twelve feet. A good 12 feet from that hydrant when some snake just crowded in and pushed me. That's a crime. While I can still fight back the tears, will you pay the fine? It's $20. $20? Boy, oh, boy. This is really an injustice. Do you know that? Why can't they just pay their fine, nice and quiet? Don't look at me. I'm with that girl.

 ♪♪ Hi. Hi. How'd you make out? Worse than you. Oh, too bad. Well, bye. Just a second. I know this is gonna sound like a pick-up. My father said, "If some young man approaches you in New York and says, 'This is gonna sound like a pick-up, ' that's what it'll be." And you did and it does, so it is. Bye. Wait. You really think I'm trying to pick you up, do you? Well, aren't you? Yes, but not the way you mean. How about the way my father means? I heard you say you didn't have a car. I do. A pure case of a have and a have not. Which could only lead to bitterness. No, you don't understand. My license was suspended for 30 days. I can't get my car home. And you want me to drive it for you. Right. That's a new one. No. Honest. Suspended, see? And I was wondering if you lived near 46th Street. Well, no, but I'm having lunch near there. Good. We'll eat and then we'll go... Uh huh, bye. Oh, forget lunch. Be a good Samaritan. I'm stuck, I'm really stuck. Well, okay. Now, wait a minute. Is it automatic? That's all I know how to drive. Totally automatic, even the built-in bar. Bar? What kind of car do you have? Rolls. Royce? Yeah. You want me to drive a Rolls Royce? I mean, a Rolls Royce. I'd be afraid. Oh, it's just a car. And Buckingham Palace is just a house. What if I scratch it? I'll buy a new one. ♪♪ Wow, I made it. And without a bit of damage. Are you kidding? I was so nervous, my knees are black and blue from knocking together. Well, you'll be more comfortable next time. No next time. I really have to go. Thanks a lot for a nerve-racking experience. Wait a minute. Ann, it's only 11:30. You've got time for a drink. All we have to do is go to your place, is that it? Not even that far. I have heard of co-op apartments before, but not quite this cooperative. Edward spotted us from the terrace. Hello. Hello. How do you get away with using the elevator like this? We own the building. That'll do it. What, no, uh, cocktail music? ♪♪ Stereo. Now, what can I do to repay your kindness? Would you like a free apartment for a year or two? Look, if you really wanna help, would you get me a cab? Edward, where's the best place to buy a cab in a hurry? Any special color? Oh, just anything with a meter. Yes, ma'am. I am gonna see you again. What for? You can afford a chauffeur. But not as cute as you. I'm sorry. I don't think it would work out. Why? I can't change a tire. Thank you. A taxi. Some economy. Hi, Don. Hi. I thought you were gonna try and save money. I am. Mm hm. I didn't pay for the cab. You won a contest? You won't believe it. Try me. The rich boy paid for it. The rich boy? Mm hm. The rich boy who couldn't drive his Rolls home. His license was suspended, and I drove it for him. You drove it for him? Uh huh. We had a drink in his elevator and he offered to buy me a taxi. Buy you a taxi? You don't believe it. It's entirely logical. Yes, I do, I do. You do? Yeah. Donald, how could you believe such a crazy story? 'Cause you're not the kind of girl who'd make up a story like that to make a fellow jealous. Oh. Are you jealous? You think you'll see him again? No. Then I'm not jealous, just hungry. Oh, hey, about dinner tonight. We haven't had lunch. No. No, I may be working late. That's no problem. Pick me up at the theater. You can watch from backstage. Oh, good, good. Then I get to see that dumb play again. Dumb? Dumb. They should change the title from Too Many Artichokes to Too Many Nuts. It's A Preponderance of Artichokes. Oh, sorry. A Preponderance of Nuts. It's experimental theater. The author is striking out in new directions. Striking out? I think he was hit by a pitched ball. ♪♪ This is my apartment. And those are your flowers. Oh. The man in the Rolls Royce. You made me sound like a movie. You act like a movie. How did you get in here, and what is all this? The flowers are a gesture of my appreciation. I came along as a talking thank you note. Roses are red, violets are blue. Surprise, surprise, I found you. Thank you. How did you find me? Very simple. I called the traffic court. They had no right to give you information. When I told them I had only two days to live, they couldn't refuse. You lied. Brilliant. Now, are you ready for dinner? Boy, you don't waste any time, do you? Oh, with so little of it left? Will you stop that? Look, you gotta go. I have to get ready. Oh, yes, the play tonight. How do you know about that? Some fellow called. Don, I think. You talked to Don? Mm hm. Uh, he said he'd be late for the show tonight, and I said that was all right 'cause you'd probably be with me. You didn't? No, I didn't. I told him I was fixing the phone and I'd deliver the message. Am I gonna see you tonight? Sure, if you buy a ticket. See you tonight. You'll see me but I won't see you. Oh, we'll see who sees who. Ann? What? My finger. Ann, would you believe we got a sold out house for this dog? Really? Gee, it's awfully quiet for a full house. Yes, the lull before the lull. Now, come on, Gus. This is a fine play. Rotten, but fine. What? I mean, it's rotten but it's fine because at least it's an attempt at something different. Yeah, mass theatrical suicide. A Preponderance of Artichokes. Stand by. Curtain. The artichokes are in bloom again. Oh, artichokes, what secrets lie hidden 'neath your leafy folds? I carry them with me now as I carried them with me on my wedding day. Yes, I carry them in memory of my divorce. Hey, what's going on here? A play. Where's the audience? What happened to our sold-out house? It was sold out to me. To my favorite artichoke. W-what's going on here? He bought out the house. Are you some sort of a nut, friend? No. I just wanted a nice, intimate evening with the young lady. Oh, well, then you wouldn't mind if we split? No, not at all. That's it, kids. Everybody go home. Bye. Bye. Alone at last. Mm hm. You, me and a preponderance of artichokes. My... Speak not. Ha ha. Speak not of who is an artichoke. You're not. Wrong, I am. All the parts. You paid for a performance, and you're going to get one. And as the demented husband walks off, the wife shouts out. Go demented husband. Seek out the fertile fields and bring back the answer. It is harvest time. Wife bows her head and weeps into her artichoke. Curtain falls. Act two. Oh. Mother is in the kitchen. Hey, Ma, Ma. Hey, Ma, what's for breakfast? Artichokes. Artichokes, darling. We better save some for dinner. For tonight we may have our gentleman caller. Hurry off to the loft, and bring your tired ma a mess of fresh artichokes. Donald? Oh, uh, hi, Don. Ann, what's going on? Haven't you ever seen a one-woman performance before? Not for a one-man audience. Who's he? He bought out the house tonight. You must be Don. I'm Roddy Waxman. Nice to meet you. The fellow with the elevator. We sort of met on the phone. I was the telephone repairman in Ann's apartment. Ann's apartment? Well, Donald, I wasn't there when he got there. When I got there, he left right away. You see, Roddy's kind of a practical joker. Wait-wait a minute. Wait a minute. Roddy Waxman of The Waxmans? Yup. You didn't tell me you met one of "the" Waxmans. I didn't know he was a "the" Waxman. Anyway, what's a Waxman? Oh, nothing much. They just invest in about half a dozen Broadway shows every season, that's all. Ha. That's not bad, Ann. Exactly what does that mean? I think it's fairly obvious. You think I'd go out with him because his family's influential in the theater? Well, what's wrong with that? Oh, what a terrible thing to say. Uh, he said it. I didn't. He's only accusing me of it; you're expecting me to. I think you're both awful. Ann, can we settle this alone? Donald, that is the first sensible thing you've said. You and Mr. Waxman settle it. I'm going home. Alone. Well, what do we do now? Oh, I don't know. Why don't you buy the theater? ♪♪ Miss Marie? Compliments of Mr. Waxman. Judy, Judy, will you come in here? Well, thank you, thank you. "Not an artichoke in sight. Bon Appétit, Roddy." Wow. Lobster, oysters, pheasant, shrimp, stuffed cabbage. Those are stuffed grape leaves. No. I don't think we should keep it. Keep it. It's an international food festival. Oh, thank goodness Leon is working tonight. My egg. My egg is burning. Who needs an egg? Oh, lobster. Mmm, pheasant, shrimp. Oh, everything. Hi. Hi. We did have a dinner date, remember? Will these do? Oh, Donald. You are so sweet. You didn't have to do that. You didn't have to do that. We're loaded. Look at all the stuff we got. Isn't that absolutely beautiful? Here, have a pheasant leg. Where did all that come from? Donald, I can explain. It won't be easy, but I really can. I'll get it. Hello? Oh, uh, hello. I bet that's him. Who? How should I know? Yes, it most certainly did arrive. It's really very generous of you. Well, I-I really don't know. Listen, could you call me another time? Okay, and thank you. Bye. Guess who that was? Ha. Roddy Waxman. Right. Yeah, and, uh, he provided all the goodies? Are you mad? Well, I don't like it. Try the rice, it's great. Ann. Ann, a nice girl does not accept expensive food from someone she hardly knows. Donald, he was trying to be nice. It's no more than you did with your hamburgers. Y-yeah, it's about $50 more. Look, I know when I'm outclassed. Me and my measly little hamburgers. Oh, Donald. I'm sure your little hamburgers are just as delicious as any of his stuff. Ann, he asked you for a date, didn't he? Yes. You gonna see him? I don't know. If you don't know, you may as well see him. What does that mean? You'd know if you didn't wanna see him. And since I don't, I do? Do what? Wanna see him. If you feel that way, see him. I didn't say that. Well, you didn't say you didn't. Then maybe I should. Maybe you should. I think I'd better take my measly little hamburgers and go. They're not measly. Rotten, yes, but not measly. Did you have a nice time? Oh, yes, it was marvelous. Thank you. The food was the best yet. What would you like to try tomorrow night? A reducing salon. Look, Ann, I have tickets for the theater tomorrow night. Suppose we try a late supper at The Purple Peacock. Oh, Roddy, I really don't think so. Not tomorrow night. I'm a little tired. Oh, sure, we'll skip a night. It's been a hectic week. I could get to bed early myself. Oh, it's a shame to waste the tickets. I'll buy some more for the next night. Did you ever think what you'd do if you didn't have a lot of money? What a ridiculous idea. Yeah, I guess it is. Well, good night, Roddy. Thank you for a really lovely evening. One of many. Good night, Roddy. Thank you. Good night. Ann? Yes. Ah. Hi. You're home early tonight. Do you stand by the door waiting for me to come in? I'm just doing what your father told me, to keep an eye on you. Where did you eat? The Purple Peacock. Wow. How was the food? Oh, it was nice, real nice. You know, for a girl who's supposed to be having the time of her life, you don't seem to be having much fun. Judy, do you know it's been five whole days since Don left here with his hamburgers? Gee, maybe he got ptomaine. He called and he said he'd been working overtime every night. But I don't believe that. Well, if he's the kind that gives up that easily, it's a good thing to know. You're full of philosophy. Well, you know what they say, easy come, easy go. Is that what they say? That's what they say. Whoever they are, they don't know Donald. It's not so terribly late. Don could still... Come on, phone, ring. Hello? Oh, Donald. I was just talking about you. To who? Oh, to me. I mean, I was just wondering why... Such a coincidence. Well, isn't it rather late to be calling? I tried phoning a couple of times but there wasn't any answer. I guess you were out with son of Daddy Warbucks again. Why the call, Don? Well, I just wanted to let you know that operation overtime is finished and I'm ready. For what? What's the best restaurant you can think of? What? The best restaurant, what is it? Uh, the Purple Peacock. Good. What are you talking about? I'll tell you tomorrow night at the Purple Peacock, over the richest food you ever ate. ♪♪ Is this or is this not class? Oh, it's class. It wasn't easy getting reservations. This is a very, very exclusive place. It looks it. Bonsoir, Mademoiselle Marie. Oh, good evening, Andre. You've been here before? Oh, well, most head waiters are called Andre. Yeah, and most customers are called Mademoiselle Marie. You've been here plenty. Oh, Donald, I've never been here with you. I wanted this to be special. It is special. This way, please. Thank you. Why didn't you tell me you've been here before? You didn't ask me that. You asked me what was the best restaurant I could think of. I had a feeling this is the kind of place he's been taking you to. You now have a good basis for comparison. Donald, food is hardly a basis for comparison. Would you like to try cars? No. I just want you to see what I look like in the wonderful world of richness. Oh, Donald, you are you, and Roddy is... Roddy. Uh, what's he doing here? He practically lives here. Don, you can't afford a place like this. Ann. Ann, on a one-shot basis, I can. I'm investing 35 bucks to play just one game in his ballpark. Compliments of Monsieur Waxman. Well, uh, you, uh, just tell Monsieur Waxman, thank you very much, but I can pay for everything I order. Then I shall return the wine, Monsieur? Uh, oh, no. No, no, no. Open it. Looks like good wine. But I'm paying for it. Oh, it is, monsieur. Marcel L'auberge, 1955. The year or the price? Both. Good price for that year. I-I think we'd better have a look at the menu. Thank you. Why aren't your prices listed? Monsieur, our regular customers have never questioned our prices. Well, I just don't like to buy a pig in a poke. It is just as well. We do not serve it. How's the wine? Good, very good. Why don't we let Roddy pay for it? He sent it over. Ann. Ann, I don't wanna hear about that. But 19.55 a bottle... I don't wanna hear about that, either. Thank you. Ann. Ann, there's something you should know. The prices on this menu in no way coincide with the money in this pocket. Donald, that's all... Is something wrong, monsieur? Yes. Yes, your prices. One gets what one pays for. Yeah, and one may get what one is asking for. May I please have the bill for the wine? And I said I wanted to play in his ballpark. I can't even make bat boy. Thank you. Let's go. Ann, what are you doing? Donald, it's 19.55 a bottle. Donald, why don't we go some place more suitable? You know any place that serves hotdogs at this hour? No, but we can find one. Ann, I should've known I couldn't compete with a boy millionaire. Donald, there's no competition. Oh, you telling me? The only thing he doesn't have is dandruff. Does he? I don't know. See. Come on, I'll take you home. Wait a minute. I forgot to leave a tip. It was rotten service. Yeah, it will be a rotten tip. Wait here. Oh, thank you. Oh, hello, Roddy. Something tells me Don has money problems. Oh, no, no. We just came in for a drink. Don loves to come in here for a drink. Not staying for dinner? Oh, no, he's got other plans for dinner. He has a physical first thing in the morning, and he can't have any rich foods after-after 9:20. Ann, tell me the truth. Wasn't this a contest between him and me tonight? Oh, no, no. Ann. Well, yeah, I guess it was, sort of. How'd I make out? Oh, look, Roddy, you're awfully sweet, but you're not real. Yes, I am, honest. It's really been nice dating you but... Well, let me put it this way. You're Disneyland. I mean, it's an awfully nice place to visit, but I don't think I wanna live there. You sure? Positive. So long. Bye. Now, what was that all about? Well, I guess you could say I just told Roddy I like root beer better than I like champagne. And, uh, you wanna know something else? What? Dandruff. ♪♪ Would you please pass the "tomatoes concentré"? The what? The ketchup. You know, they can rave all they want about their fancy French food. When it comes to plain good eating, there's nothing in the world like a hotdog. Ann, you've made an excellent choice, and with me, you may live on 'em. ♪♪
