 What about here? 'Some, you don't even have to think about.' Darling, will you be my emergency birthing partner? lf Nathan's not here on the day? I'd rather shove shards of broken glass up my arse. 'Then there are those that steel up and ambush us when we least expect it.' I've got to go. You haven't got to do anything. Try telling my English tutor when I'm late with my essay again. You could always um... ..bring your work back here. Just get in the way. I want you in the way. All of the time. I could get used to it. Sitting by the window, gazing at the sea, being all wistful and inspired. Could fix you a desk up, I could even help. Try me. "Hamlet is a play about procrastination. Discuss." Don't you think that's a little bit simplistic? He had a lot of heavy stuff going on. He wanted to gather his thoughts. Especially when you're getting all your info from the ghost. I didn't know you were into Shakespeare. It's very insightful. Oh, I could save you hours. Hours that could be much, much better spent. That's it. I'm sold. Really? Sure. You don't wanna think about it? What's there to think about? Oh, wow, we could put the desk just there like you want it. I could create loads of room in the wardrobe for your clothes and stuff. We'll still...we'll still need some more storage space but... We could go furniture shopping. Make this place ours more than just mine. All my work, stuff, everything... Do you want me to help you or will Nathan? 'Is it just me or do other people make life-changing decisions without meaning to?' - Moving in...with you? - Yeah, it's fabulous. It's crazy! (Kim) So you're sure? Yes, I'm sure. You know I'm a student with no domestic skills and no income. You wanna be careful, Kim. I might just change my mind. Really? Go pack. Call me if you need a hand. Come and find me at the club later. We'll celebrate. Great. 'Some decisions are made so fast, it's hard to believe we made them.' Fuck. 'Perhaps because we didn't... 'which begs the question, 'to move on or not to move in.' Heads, I move in. 'Some people trust these things to fate. 'lf they believe in fate of course.' Best of three. 'Others advise a more systematic approach. 'On the positive side, 'living with Saint would mean peace, serenity and time to think. 'I could get a glamorous job to contribute.' What can I get you, ladies? 'And who could fail to be happy with sex on tap? GIGGLING You filthy bitch. GIGGLING 'On the negative side...' PHONE RINGS Yes, I have the mung beans. Yeah, they're organic. Do you want onions with that? Yes, please. 'Let's face it. What kind of job could I really get? 'And as for sex...' Pst. Did you feed the cat? 'Hello. Lesbian bed death coming on.' Best of 15. 'lf only the cosmos would help out a little. 'Send some kind of sign. 'Any kind of sign. 'Of course moving in with Saint would mean leaving my family. Have a word with Matt, Kim. He won't eat, he won't drink. He won't even come out of his coffin. 'What a wrench that would be.' Look at me. Look at me! I don't even realise I'm doing it. Things have got to change. I have got to change. It's just a glass of wine. You have got to change. I have another chance of being a mother and I am not going to waste it. Can I have that lot please? No...Kimmy, I mean it. This is the beginning of a new responsible era. With all of my babies. Get up, you freak. lf you're gonna kill yourself, do it somewhere else. I miss Sugar. She had all the best clothes. 'I'd have to leave all this behind. 'All this.' You're not playing with yourself again now I've gone, have you? What are you doing here? Just came to get my stuff. Have you got all your drugs? SHE SlGHS Sorry. I'm cleaning up my act, I'll have you know. I got a job. Really? Where? Market. Money's shit but I'm flogging really cool shoes and I get a discount.

SHE SlGHS - Don't buy a pair for my sake. - Why would I do that? (Both) Those ones. I like the colour of them. Get them then. - Put these aside. - No! - Why not? - You either want them or you don't. Taking longer to decide is not going to make a difference. I'll take them. - Look, I'll leave them. - For fuck's sake! I'm...OK, I'm taking them. - Make up your mind. - I said I'll take them. Good.

She's your girlfriend. 'You can avoid an issue for so long... 'but there comes a time when you have to be a woman and face your fears head on. 'Then again, it's always good to gather your thoughts.' Kim? Hi! I... just dropped an earring. Really? Yeah...not from my ear. It's a small diamond one which I keep in my pocket. My gran gave it to me to remind me of her. - Are you sure you dropped it down there? - Not really. Could be anywhere. - Is it silver or gold? - Silver. Couldn't be, could it? Cos I said diamond. I'm writing lists. Should I? Shouldn't I? Tossing coins. - I thought you wanted to move in. - I did. I do. Maybe. It's just, it's a really big step, you know. And I've got to think it through properly. Stop doing it. See... I annoy you. I would annoy you. I spend hours in the bathroom, and I wouldn't clear up after myself and I'd get those weird annoying cramps in my legs when I sleep. Forget it. It was only a suggestion anyway. - We'll still see each other. - Course. I just think I need... a couple of months, you know, to finish my exams. Fine, whatever. So we're all right? Yeah, yeah, just... Forget I ever said anything. - I'll get these. - I'll get it. - It's my turn. - Put your money away. - I'll get them. - Just let me pay for the fucking coffee! Sorry. It's definitely yours next time, OK? I've got to go to work. Nice shoes. Thanks for noticing. BOTH SPEAK - Go on. - No, you. No, you. Just gonna say, do you think it's gonna be a big do? Dunno. Me, you, couple of others maybe. Oh, maybe not. What were you gonna say just now? - Dunno. - You must. - It was nothing important. - Tell me then. Who cares! (Kim) Let's just go have a few drinks, yeah. Sugar! Fuck it. I can't be bothered with this. Where are you going? I was just gonna say something about the weather. You're right. Who the fuck cares? - You know, I thought we were OK. - Did you really? Oh, you know what? It's fine. We're just at really different stages and I didn't realise that until right now. And... I wanna share my life with someone, Kim. And you wanna party which is all right, cos that's exactly what I wanted to do at your age. So go, please. - Have some fun. - We can do both, you know. You don't want to do, though. See you later. What's happened to her? I dunno. What happened? She's in a mood about something as usual. Come on! Let's go and get some drinks down. - Who are all the people? - Fuck knows. They're Tara's mates. She just got out. You remember Kiz? She used to visit. You're the one that liked chatted up by the guard. That's the one. Fancy playing prison guard on these puppies later? Need a bit of attention. Come and find me! Kizzer! Stay away from her! She's got piercings that would main you for life. Here. Talk to BamBam. She's the one responsible for the horse pills. - Never again! - Tell me about it. I'm strictly organic now. BamBam? She clubbed her social worker over the head with a lamb chop. - We've all got our stories to tell. - lf I had any good ones. What's the story with you and Saint? Tell you later. Come on! Let's go and dance! - What is Saint gonna think of him? - Who cares? - Who's Saint? - Her girlfriend. She wanted me to move in with her. Spend her life with someone. Come on! I don't want that at my age, do I? No way, girl. Reckless sex and binge drinking. That's what it's about. So does that mean you're like gay or... Kizzer! Ouch! (Sugar) I think you're mad. You've got the chance to live in a seafront apartment, with a girl who's crazy about you. Are you just gonna turn that down? It's a big step. So what you gonna do? Stick it out with the Addams Family cos you're scared of commitment? It's more than that though. Do you ever wonder what would have happened between us? lf you hadn't gone away. Sometimes. And? Kim... We have our moments but most of the time, we annoy the fuck out of each other. Saint's great. She's great for you. You two, you make sense. And you know it. Besides, it'd never top the night we did have. I'll still be thinking about that one when I'm shuffling around in my incontinence pants. That's if I don't have Alzheimer's. (Crying) Shugs. Now... Go and get your girl. 'Women are wonderful. 'Being a woman is wonderful. 'For a start, you always have the right to change your mind. BUZZER You're meant to bring pot plants, aren't you? Can I move in? I thought they were more like housewarming gifts. I wouldn't know, would I? Never moved in with anyone before. Me neither. So you coming in or what? Let's forget about pros and cons, different stages. It suddenly dawned on me that I missed out on one big deciding factor. You have a cappuccino maker. And I love you. What's this? You're not gonna cry on me, are you? - No. - Yes, you are. You big softie. You know, we can do this every day. All day. Yes, please. BUZZER Shit. 'Sometimes when you wrestle with a decision for days, 'you wonder what all the fuss was about.' My fucking flat's gone up in flames! - Kimmy! - What? (Sugar) 'Some tit went and put a fag in the bin. 'I bought ashtrays especially.' SlRENS BLARE 'Talk about extreme housewarming. 'Everything gone! Up in smoke!' Oh my God, Shugs, that's awful! I loved that flat and all. It's not all bad news though. Now, I know you two are setting up a love nest and all that, but I was wondering if I could stay, just for a couple of days. You need time to think about it. Sure. I'll make us a cuppa, while you decide. 'When you glimpse the future and it looks fantastic, 'do you jump in feet first...' Tea or coffee? '..or do you keep one foot in the past... 'just in case? 'Decisions, decisions.' Falling in love again I'm falling in love again Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah... www.tvsubtitles.net
