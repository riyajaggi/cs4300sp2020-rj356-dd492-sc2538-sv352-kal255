 Okay, good. Chayo, let's go! We've been here a minute too long, Chayo. I'm almost there, Lawyer. Come on, Gusano. Almost there, huh? The guard will come and we'll be fucked. See that? Told you. A beauty. The cloth, quick. Stop, motherfuckers!  Stop! What you got there, fuckers? Let's... take it easy, my friend.

 No one needs to get hurt. Let's talk it over, let's chat. -We can reach-- -Move! I'll kill that son of a-- ...brother. He got Gusano for sure, bro. And me too. What's wrong? What? Motherfucker. Look at me, stay with me, hey! Breathe, take a deep breath. We're getting out of here alive. Okay. Let's go, walk. -Get up. -No. I can't. -Don't do this. -I can't, I'm sorry. They're coming, Molina. Don't you dare die, please. Please, Chayo. Don't leave me here. Are you leaving me behind? You won't die here today... okay? Promise me. -Salazar! -Come to corridor five! Look what I found! -Salazar! -Who's there? Quick! TWO YEARS LATER What do you see when you look at this necklace? A handcrafted, four-carat sapphire  hanging on a white gold chain, right? Now... what do I see? I see an elegant woman... who has great taste... who smells nice. A woman with enough confidence and poise, of course, to wear it. A classy lady. Huh? Jorgito, help the lady. She's taking the sapphire. -Of course. Please. -Ma'am, congratulations, excellent choice. Thank you. It's a magnificent piece of jewelry, ma'am. Mr. Beli. How are you, Roberto? Brought the goodies? Are these G? Top Wesselton. Son of a gun. Mr. Belisario, since when do you carry such high-end jewelry? I have my ways. Well, look at this. All right, how much? For which one? All of them. You can have the lot for a mere 19 million... in cash. Why cash, Mr. Belisario? Your credit with us has run out. Freeze, you fucker! Stay put. Stand there. Don't move! On the floor, steady. Easy, calm down. Please, man. There's no need for this. You, move back there! Easy and steady, or else... The briefcase, asshole, now. No? Are you willing to die for some small change? -You bastard. -I said no. Let's go, man! Let's go now! Don't move, you piece of shit. What did I tell you? One dirty job, I said. One robbery. Not a fucking prison riot. You left my business looking like shit. You fucking wrecked it. -I'll have to clean up your mess. -Pops, how was I to know that son of a bitch had a gun? Oh, Sardino, they always have a gun, man. They're always armed. That's why I told you very clearly, "You go, take it, and leave." That's it. Yes, pops, but there's no need for yelling or getting mad. There is, I'm pissed. I'll yell all I want! Without those fucking diamonds, we're back to square one. We're screwed. Well, back to square one, pops. But I don't like being yelled at. I don't like your tone. Is this it? That's all we could get. Okay. Look, pops, I... have some money saved, and if you want it, you can have it. Do I look like I need your scraps? No. -Fuck. -I was just saying. -Bye, pops. -Sardino, wait. How much have you saved? As soon as I sell this merch, I'll pay you back. Honey! Baby, dinner's ready. Luisa, dinner! All right. Luisa! Come down, sweetie. Dinner's ready. Coming! Luisa, hurry, darling! Come on! -Oh, that looks delicious, honey. -Coming through. Luichis! I present to you a grilled steak, brought to you straight from Argentina. Honey, can you pour the wine? That's good. -You can have water. -Thanks. -Cheers. -Cheers. Cheers. -But this is... still alive. -Delicious. Luisa, if you like it overcooked, you can go to a restaurant, sorry. How is it? I'm not hungry. Luisa. Don't be rude. Eat. What's going on? Do we need a stage for all this drama? What's wrong, Luisa? My mom doesn't want to celebrate my 15th birthday. I said we could have some friends over. I don't understand why we have to host a black-tie gala as if you're Lady Di. Mom, I'm turning 15! It's not just any party. Precisely, my love. We should use that gift on something worthwhile. Right, darling? Mom, you're the one who wants to learn French, not me! Luisa, please. I can't invite Juanes Beninger, Linis Gómes, or the Aguirre girls to a house party. Why not? What's wrong with this house? There's nothing wrong with it. It's just that... house parties aren't cool. They'll say we're cheap. It's tacky. I think a 15th birthday party is of the utmost importance. On that, we agree. I also understand that it's important for your mother to have something more private. I think we can organize something  without splurging too much. Can't we? We could rent a small venue, have a couple of waiters. How about that? A band, a DJ, huh? You're the best! I think it's for me. -You won't leave the steak here, right? -No, sir. Honey, we won't do anything you don't agree with. Let's just throw her a simple party. Then we can send her to Nantes to study French. French toast, french fries, baguette, croissant. Oh, Roberto! We're gonna spoil that girl rotten. We'll do just fine. My love, this meat is raw. I'll go cook it more. -Do you want me to cook yours more? -No. Hello? This is no time to be calling a respectable family, Jorge. "Important"? We can talk at the jewelry shop. What? Listen to me, Jorge. Don't let them in. Don't let anyone in. POMMELÉ JEWELERS Jorge, what did I tell you? Don't let anyone in. Where are you going with that TV? You owe me three months' salary. Where do you think I'm going? Fucking son of a bitch. Wait a minute. Wait. -Are you the one in charge? -Yes. Do yourself a favor. Tell your people to put everything back where it was. Mr. Lozano, I presume? Isn't it weird that two out of three places I repossess get robbed just before I arrive? Listen, there's no turning back, Mr. Lozano. And we'll go straight to your house next. Look. My lawyer, "Mr. Nuñez," just called. And he was wondering if you could delay this procedure for a week. Tell your lawyer this gives him until tomorrow. Sir, I have no money, not a single penny. If you get me two million pesos for the day after tomorrow, I'll help you with the repossession. But if you don't, I'll make sure that same day, even your toilet is taken from your house. Now do me a favor and sign here... Chayo. I thought I'd never see you again. {\an8}To be honest, neither did I. I'm looking for a job. That's surprising. -But I have nothing. -It doesn't have to be big. Boris, I'll do anything. Anything: petty theft, breaking and entering. Anything, as long as it's right away. Are things that bad? What about your reputation? Don't be an asshole, Boris. I'm drowning here. Help me out, brother. Well, there is something, but I have a bad feeling about it. It's a shady job. What is it? The Bank of the Republic in Valledupar. How much are we talking about? About eight billion. So, why the bad feeling? Money's been paid, and nothing ever gets done. I think it's just a guy that's full of shit. For starters, they want 120 million and to be in charge. I can put you in touch, I get a cut, but whatever happens next is on you. Get me an appointment. Come on. "Get me an appointment"? You can't fool around with this guy. This is serious. This job is for pros. You have nothing to offer. What are you going to do, put a new gang together? Let's see. How about that one? It seems that thing isn't pumping enough blood to your brain. Lawyer. {\an8}JAIRO MOLINA VALENCIA - ALIAS "THE LAWYER" Can we talk? -Sorry, Mayito. -Sure. What do you want? I want... to work with you again. I have a wonderful job for us. Two years without a word, and the first thing that comes to mind is offering me a job? What a nerve, right? I apologized to you a long time ago, Molina. You're the one who never called back. You never contacted me, never answered my calls. I'm here because this is the most ambitious operation of our entire lives, believe me when I say so. The Bank of the Republic in Valledupar. Molina, you and I executed 12 perfect jobs, flawless. We messed up once, and you decide to drop everything? It wasn't me who took his time and let everything go to hell. Know what that minute cost me? -I do, Molina. -No, you have no fucking clue. Six hours a day, three times a week, sitting on this motherfucking chair. You have no fucking clue what it's like. Molina. -Stop the complaining and-- -Complaining? Fuck you. Nurse! The gentleman is leaving. All right. Let's do something. Call me when you've grown a pair. Hi, Brayan. Chayo. Fuck... I'll tell her. Is the missus there? No, don't put her on the phone. I'll call her. Don't tell her I called. Bye. Baby... you left the stove on again. What's wrong? Why are you acting so strange? -Strange? How? -Mom! -Mom... -Did you miss the bus? No, they didn't let me on because we haven't paid. What?  But you paid, right? On the 15th. Did you forget? How could I forget? No, I paid the whole year's tuition in advance, the whole year. -Well, they said you didn't. -That's not true. I paid for the whole year in January. I'll call the school to see what happened. Yes, baby, call them. What a nerve! Unbelievable! You know what, honey? I'll go fix this problem in person, they can't get away with this. And they'd better apologize to Luisa for leaving her in the street like a dog. Luichis, start the car. We leave in five minutes. -Okay. Bye, Mom. -Bye, sweetie. What are we doing here? I have to do something quick. No, Roberto, I don't want to stay here alone. It'll be five minutes. I promise I won't be long. -Then I'll go with you. -No, stay here. Listen to some music. Honk if you need anything. Okay, but leave me the keys then. {\an8}JACKIE ATEHORTÚA - ALIAS "MRS. K" How does the saying go? "Every dog has its day." I think you mean "karma is a bitch." May I? Mr. Brayan. What's up, man? Well. -Let's cut to the chase. -You finally paying me? I came to offer you a way to settle our differences. Do you know what I live off? My reputation. And this works like clockwork because people believe in me. But I was a fool and did something for you I'd never done before. I cut you some slack. Yes, but it's also true-- The fact that you're here right now... must mean not that I was a fool, but you must think I'm stupid. I have a very slick project going on. A big one. All I need is for someone to put up the money for me, just a couple million pesos to close the deal first thing tomorrow morning. Can you believe this guy? He comes asking for money when he owes me a fortune. It's a billion pesos apiece. Plus, you'll get all your money back. A billion pesos? Where will you get that kind of money? From the motherfucking state, Mrs. K. We're taking down the Bank of the Republic in Valledupar. I got the tip from Boris. Serious people from the Atlantic Coast are involved. -I stopped believing you a while ago. -Well, don't believe me. Fine. Believe Molina. The Lawyer is in. This is what's going to happen. Tell Molina to come here tomorrow morning and explain the details to me. If he can convince me, you'll have the two million. We'll figure out the rest later. Now we're talking. Well, Mrs. K, since I'm here... and we're back in business... check out this beautiful piece I brought. Would you buy it from me? I'm almost giving it away. Right, Brayan? Let me show you something I saw in a movie once. Don't you forget you owe me money. What happened? -My nose started bleeding. -What did they do to you? -I swear, it's just a nosebleed. -Who did this? No one, sweetie, it's just a nosebleed. That doesn't just happen! For God's sake, Luisa, you want a party or not? Do you want your party or not? Answer me. Yes. Then repeat after me... "Roberto has a nosebleed." You have a nosebleed. Nurse, could you hand me Jairo Molina's medical record, if you'd be so kind? -Can I have the order for that, Doctor? -I just gave it, didn't you hear me? My supervisor demands a written and stamped order with the doctor's medical ID. Then, tomorrow, when my patient, Attorney Molina, has complications, you'll call the supervisor and tell him it was your negligence that has our patient in a critical, irreversible condition. Carmencita. -Thank you, then. -Jairo who? Jairo Molina Valencia, he's on dialysis. -Hi, Romy. -What are you doing here? I know Jairo is dying. And if you didn't want to tell me, that's fine. -But at least let me talk to him. -No. I doubt he'll want to speak to you, Chayo. Well, let's try. If he doesn't, I'll leave. Molina! Molina! What's with the screaming? You're dying and you didn't tell me, brother. Have you told your wife you're refusing surgery? What are you talking about? The doctors told Molina he needs a transplant. But he said no, that he didn't want one. He's not a candidate for surgery. Bullshit. Do you know why he's not a candidate? He hasn't run a single test, not one. Try and deny it. The tests cost around 11 million pesos, just to see if I'm a candidate. If I am, they'll put me on a list with other suckers that usually die before they can get the transplant. Molina, in this country, money will put you at the top of the list. How much is a transplant? Tell me. -Forty million? Sixty million? -Eighty. There we have it. With the job offer I made you, bro, you could get ten new kidneys. -Will you die over a few bucks? -I wouldn't be dying if I hadn't been shot twice thanks to you, asshole. -Know what your problem is? -What? Your real sickness? You think you have all the answers. And you don't. Bro, please come to your senses. It's ten billion pesos waiting to be taken from that bank's vault. -Let's put together a fucking team. -Chayo, just leave. Listen, if you want to be left out of the greatest hustle  in the history of this country, fine. But if you want in, I'll wait for you tomorrow morning at Mrs. K's junkyard. Thanks, Romy. Lozano residence, good evening. -Do you have my money? -Of course I do. I'm counting it as we speak. Okay, I'll be on your doorstep at 8:00 on the dot with the truck. -I have a doctor's appointment. 12:00. -Okay, at 12:00. And drop the truck bullshit. See you then. I'll be there at twelve o'clock sharp. At noon. Did you need me? Yes, Gaviota. Or should I call you Teresa Suárez? Don't waste your time trying to deny it, Ms. Suárez. It all came down to believing you or not. And we fell for it! We believed you studied in Europe... your career as an executive, your first and last name... There you go. That's it, smile. Say cheese. Cheese! There! Now the godparents... Over here, another one as backup. Cheese! Now let's put the candles on the cake. -Yes, the candles! -The candles. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday, dear Luisa Happy birthday to you! Since when... do you decide for the both of us? I don't want to jeopardize all we've accomplished in the last couple of years doing something I'm sure isn't going to work. I don't care about that. We'll sell everything, the routes, the house. Everything, anything. I'd rather die at home for free than broke in a hospital. Wait, don't say that. I'd rather be penniless on the streets for a surgery that might not save you. But it's not fair for me to spend the rest of my life wondering what would've happened if you'd had surgery. Romy... it's my life. I'm the one who's dying. Let me choose how I want to die. Okay? That's exactly the problem. You're not dying alone. It's 11:00, and the Lawyer isn't here. -He said he's on his way. -I have another appointment. You know I never miss an appointment. -Let's give him five more minutes. -Mrs. K! For God's sake! Well, better late than never, Lawyer. I wanted to come as prepared as possible. The Bank of the Republic in Valledupar distributes cash throughout the coast. Here's a detailed list of the charter flights the bank hires. The next one is in 18 days. If you look closely... it's the last one this year. That flight has our money, Mrs. K. Exactly. How much money are we talking about? Twelve billion pesos. And we're being modest. Well, Mrs. K, let's get to business, shall we? Let's hurry before someone else comes up with the same idea. Perfect. Well, the ball's rolling, damn it! I'll be in touch! Hello. What's up, baby? -Hi, baby. -Hello. -We were waiting for you. -Yes. You didn't tell me you were meeting Mister... Nuñez. Ramiro Nuñez. He's here to offer us a deal. -About the house, he was telling me. -Exactly. Mr. Ramiro, did they offer you anything to drink? -No, I'm sorry. -Coffee would be fine. Thank you, honey. Thanks. The trucks are two blocks away. It's all there, two million. Where did he go? I said we weren't interested in his offer, and he left. What was his proposal? He wanted the house to build a residential complex. No way. -I'll leave this house when I'm dead. -That's what I said. {\an8}ROAD TO VALLEDUPAR Look what I just found. Oh! Oh, man! Cheer up, man. Yeah! I remember when Jaime Molina was drunk He would say that if I died first He would paint my portrait But if he died first I would write him a song If I died first He would paint my portrait But if he died first I would write him a song I'd rather have-- Mrs. K. Another one, Lawyer? Thirty-five minutes late, brother. I know, but let's not... act like assholes. The coast has its own pace. Let's relax. Ulises? The one and only. -Are you Chayo? -Yes, sir. -How are you? -Nice to meet you, man. Come in. These are my partners. Excuse me. -A drink? -No. I'm still hungover from last night. Huh? I might still be drunk. Well... did you bring the advance? Let's talk about collateral first. Collateral? What are you talking about, darling? I only work with reliable people. Ask around Valledupar, they'll tell you Ulises Díaz is a reliable and trustworthy guy. Now, with what I have for you, you may or may not get the job done. That, I can't guarantee, you know? And who are the reliable people you work with? Aren't you here to buy? I'm not here to mess around, man, or to waste my time talking to women. Oh, that's more like it. Now we're talking. My wife is also in charge of the money. Well, I make the money, but she makes sure I don't spend it. Did you bring a pen and paper? BANK OF THE REPUBLIC Ten days from now, the armored truck arrives from Bogotá. Since the load will be in military custody, the whole "steal the truck" thing is a bad idea. The cash has to be taken straight from the bank, but that building is a bunker. The load is here. The cash load is here. Shipment's about to come in! The cash is here. There's police presence outside, 24/7. Yes, Lieutenant! The whole building is monitored from the control room. The cash is here. The building has three vaults. The one we care about is in the treasury basement. To get there, we have to go through three security gates. And then... you reach the safest vault in all of Colombia. Not that easy, huh? Many have tried to find a way, but no one has figured out how to do it. But I have faith in you. Ulises, what do we need to do to get the rest of the information from you? That's all the information, bro. I'll leave you my card. Call me, and I'll put you in touch with the guy at the bank. Work something out with him, and he'll give you more details. Wait, not so fast. You think the three bits of useless information you gave us are worth 120 million pesos? Listen, ma'am... can't you see this is not your turf? This isn't yours anymore. Either I take this money now, or come pick it up later with some friends of mine. Are you threatening me? Jackie... Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure, as you say. Cheers. If you'll excuse me. Have a nice day. Welcome to Valledupar. One hundred and twenty million pesos for this? We're screwed and far from home. "We're screwed"? "We" is too many people. -I'm outta here. -What?  You can't leave. I'm out, brother, that's a ton of bullshit. For fuck's sake! You came all this way to chicken out? Yes, I am a pussy for listening to an ass like you. And you're a fool for giving this idiot money. Wait a minute, Lawyer. You said we could do this. Keep your word. Word my ass, Jackie! This is a joke, that man was a clown! Let that asshole leave! Who cares? We can do this ourselves. We have all the information. -We can figure it out. -Shut up, asshole! You know we can't do this without Molina. And before you answer, here's a piece of information. I do have money, of course I have money, but I didn't have 120 million in cash laying around under my mattress. So what did I do? I borrowed it. And you know who I borrowed it from? The People. And we... I say "we" because now, naturally, we don't owe them 120 million pesos anymore. We now owe them 480 million pesos which I promised in return. So look... Look at me. Either we rob that fucking bank, or we'll end up chopped up in a landfill.
