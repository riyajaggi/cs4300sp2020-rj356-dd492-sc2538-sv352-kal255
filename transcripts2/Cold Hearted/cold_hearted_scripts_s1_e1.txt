 THAT LISTED ALL THE THINGS THEY WERE GOING TO PURCHASE. WE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG, BUT YOU DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO END UP BEING THE WAY IT WAS. LOVE AND MONEY, YOU PUT THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER AND IT CAN BE A DANGEROUS COMBINATION. IN MAY OF 2003, CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER JAMES GLASS IS STATIONED AT CAMP SNAKE PIT, A U. S. MARINE INSTALLATION IN KUWAIT, WHEN HE IS AWOKEN BY A COLLEAGUE. A FELLOW WARRANT OFFICER HAD COME TO ME AND SAID THAT THERE WAS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY GOING ON. HE WANTED A FELLOW OFFICER TO OBSERVE IT. HE LED ME TO THIS BUNKER.

 WE STAYED DOWN THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES, BUT I'M NOT SEEING WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SEE. NEXT THING I KNOW, AN EXPLOSION WENT OFF. I WAS BLOWN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING. I COULDN'T SEE. I COULDN'T HEAR. THERE'S BLOOD ALL OVER ME. IT WAS LIKE MY WORLD DROPPED OUT FROM UNDERNEATH ME. I THOUGHT IT WAS A ROCKET ATTACK ON THE MILITARY BASE. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET YOU TAKEN CARE OF, ALL RIGHT? A FEW DAYS LATER, JAMES WILL LEARN WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, AND IT'S FAR MORE PERSONAL THAN ANYONE IN A WAR ZONE COULD EVER IMAGINE. GROWING UP IN RURAL LOUISIANA, JAMES GLASS IS DEALT A TOUGH HAND RIGHT FROM THE START. I WAS BORN IN WESTLAKE, LOUISIANA. AND I'VE GOT A YOUNGER BROTHER BY THREE YEARS, ROBERT. MY FATHER DIED WHENEVER I WAS FIVE YEARS OLD. HE DIED OF EMPHYSEMA. HE WAS A THREE-PACK-A-DAY SMOKER. IT WAS HARD. IT WAS TERRIBLE. IT WAS PUTTING ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF THE OTHER, DAY BY DAY. LET US PRAY. OUR FATHER, WHO ART IN HEAVEN, HALLOWED BE THY NAME. AS A NEWLY-MINTED SINGLE PARENT, JAMES' MOTHER STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH RAISING TWO CHILDREN ON HER OWN. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. YES, IT IS. WHAT I DO WITH MY TIME IS MY BUSINESS. NO, IT'S MINE, TOO. MY MOTHER GOT WITH THIS GUY AND HE WAS ABUSIVE. HE ABUSED HER. HE ABUSED MY BROTHER AND I. THAT'S NOT MY KID; THAT'S YOUR KID. COME ON. THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. IT WAS TERRIBLE. HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING? AT ONE POINT, HE WAS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS BROTHER, MAKING SURE HE ATE AND WAS TAKEN CARE OF. SOON ENOUGH, THE SITUATION BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE. THE TEACHERS SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS WRONG AND STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS. HORRIFIED BY THE BOYS' ANSWERS, A TEACHER CALLS CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES. TWO BIG HIGHWAY PATROLMEN CAME IN AND GOT MY BROTHER AND I, AND TOOK US OUT AND TOOK US TO A FOSTER HOME. ROBERT AND I HADN'T EATEN FOR A WHILE, AND TWO HIGHWAY PATROLS STOPPED ON THE WAY TO THE FOSTER FAMILY AND BOUGHT US DINNER. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, WE SAW A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. WHEN JAMES MEETS HIS NEW ADOPTIVE FAMILY, HIS INSTINCTS ARE PROVEN RIGHT. WE LIVED IN A WONDERFUL FOSTER HOME, AND THAT SAME FOSTER HOME MOM AND DAD WOUND UP ADOPTING ROBERT AND I. IT WAS NIGHT AND DAY. BECAUSE JAMES GREW UP THE WAY HE DID, HE ALWAYS VALUED FAMILY. AND I THINK SOMETIMES HE'S MADE A LOT OF DECISIONS OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE HE SO DESPERATELY WANTED A FAMILY OF HIS OWN, A FAMILY THAT WASN'T LIKE THE FAMILY HE GREW UP WITH. AT 24, JAMES' LOVE OF AVIATION LEADS HIM TO JOIN THE MILITARY. I REALLY STARTED DEVELOPING A PICTURE OF WHAT TYPE OF MAN I WANTED TO BECOME. MY DREAM WAS TO GO IN THE MILITARY AND BE A FIGHTER PILOT, BUT YOU HAD TO HAVE 20/20 VISION AND I DID NOT. SO I WENT AND DID THE NEXT BEST THING - - I BECAME AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER. IN THE SPRING OF 1989, JAMES, ON A WEEKEND LEAVE, DECIDES TO PAY A LONG-OVERDUE VISIT TO HIS FAMILY. AT THE TIME, I WAS STATIONED AT CHERRY POINT, NORTH CAROLINA. MY GRANDFATHER WAS STILL LIVING IN PHILADELPHIA. I CAME HOME, AND THAT SATURDAY, HE SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH ME, THERE'S A TRUCK THAT I WANT TO LOOK AT." AND WHILE HIS GRANDFATHER CHECKS OUT THE TRUCK, JAMES ENDS UP LAYING HIS EYES ON THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL BESIDE IT, 18-YEAR-OLD WENDY MCADORY. YOU MIGHT NEED THESE. I GUESS I SHOULD GO FOR A SPIN? YEAH. YOU WANT TO COME WITH ME? SHE WAS VERY PRETTY. SHE WAS A PAGEANT GIRL, VERY POPULAR AT SCHOOL. HE WAS JUST DAZZLED. HE FELL HARD AND FAST. HE'S JUST ONE OF THOSE GUYS, ONCE HE MAKES A DECISION, THAT'S IT, HE'S GOING TO DO IT. AND SO, YEAH, I THINK SHE WAS ROMANCED. THEY WERE MARRIED A MONTH LATER. IT WAS A BIG SOUTHERN WEDDING. I WAS IN MY UNIFORM. MY BEST FRIEND WAS THERE; HE WAS IN HIS UNIFORM. WENDY HAD ALL OF HER BRIDESMAIDS AND EVERYBODY SHOWED UP. BY 1991, WENDY AND JAMES WELCOMED DAUGHTER NICOLE TO THE FAMILY. AND TWO YEARS LATER, THEIR SECOND DAUGHTER, ANDREA, IS BORN. IT MEANT THE WORLD TO ME. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL TIME. I HAD A BEAUTIFUL WIFE. I HAD TWO BEAUTIFUL GIRLS. HE WAS VERY DEVOTED, JUST VERY AFFECTIONATE AND LOVING. THE GIRLS BOTH SEEMED VERY DEVOTED TO HIM. FIVE YEARS INTO HIS MARRIAGE TO WENDY, JAMES' DREAM OF THE PERFECT FAMILY APPEARS TO HAVE COME TRUE. WENDY WAS A GREAT MOM. SHE REALLY TOOK TO IT. SHE REALLY LOVED THE GIRLS. I COULDN'T HAVE ASKED FOR BETTER. MY MOM WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR MY SISTER AND I. BUT IN THE FALL OF 1994, EVERYTHING CHANGES. JAMES AND HIS YOUNG FAMILY ARE RELOCATED TO A MILITARY BASE IN JAPAN. I'M ALWAYS UP FOR ADVENTURE, AND I KNEW JAPAN WOULD BE A BIG ADVENTURE. BUT A YOUNG FAMILY WITH A TWO- AND-A-HALF-YEAR-OLD AND A ONE-YEAR-OLD - - IT WAS TAXING TO THE UTMOST. THE TRANSITION IS HARD, AND WENDY IN PARTICULAR STRUGGLES TO ADAPT. MOM WAS ALWAYS THERE, ALWAYS HOME, ALWAYS PLAYING WITH US. DAD, HE WAS ALWAYS AT WORK. I DON'T REALLY HAVE MEMORIES OF DAD PLAYING WITH US. I WAS WORKING VERY LONG HOURS. I WAS DEPLOYED TO KOREA, DEPLOYED TO AUSTRALIA, SO I WAS GONE, AND WENDY WAS LEFT ALONE WITH THE TWO KIDS. SHE BECAME A STAY-AT-HOME MOM, BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM, SHE WANTED TO BE A WORKING MOM, AND I THINK SHE ALWAYS KIND OF RESENTED THAT. WHEN YOU ARE WITH A MILITARY MAN, HIS JOB IS HIS PRIORITY, AND YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT YOUR PLACE, YOU KNOW, AND WHERE YOU FALL. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE NOT IMPORTANT, BUT HIS JOB HAS TO TAKE PRECEDENCE. WENDY ALWAYS FELT LIKE SHE WASN'T A PRIORITY, BECAUSE SHE WASN'T. BUT INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT IT WITH JAMES, WENDY FINDS SOMEONE ELSE TO COMFORT HER. I KNEW. MY HUSBAND KNEW. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW I FOUND OUT, I DON'T REMEMBER THAT, I JUST KNOW THAT I KNEW, BUT IT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS YOU JUST DIDN'T TALK ABOUT. IT'S ONE THING TO MESS AROUND ON YOUR HUSBAND. YOU GOING TO GET THAT? NO. IT GOES TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL WHEN YOU MESS AROUND WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S. THERE'S JUST SOMETHING GOING ON BETWEEN THEM. SHE BELIEVED HER HUSBAND AND MS. WENDY GLASS WERE ENGAGED IN AN ADULTEROUS AFFAIR. THEY CAME AND INTERVIEWED ME, AND I TOLD THEM ABSOLUTELY NOT. 33-YEAR-OLD MARINE JAMES GLASS BELIEVES HIS ASSIGNMENT IN JAPAN WILL HELP ADVANCE HIS CAREER. BUT LONG WORK HOURS AND EXTENDED DEPLOYMENTS BEGIN TO TAKE A TOLL ON HIS ENTIRE FAMILY, ESPECIALLY HIS WIFE, WENDY. HE'D BE GONE FOR THREE DAYS, 30 DAYS, THREE MONTHS. YOU DIDN'T ALWAYS KNOW HOW LONG HE'D BE GONE. IT WAS SO FOREIGN TO WHAT SHE WAS ACCUSTOMED, SHE WAS LONELY. AND IT'S DRIVEN HER INTO THE ARMS OF ANOTHER MAN. SHE BEGAN SEEING SOMEONE ELSE, MAYBE TO FILL A VOID SOMEWHERE WITHIN HER. SHE GOT THE ATTENTION THAT MAYBE SHE WAS MISSING AT HOME. IT'S FAIRLY COMMON, ESPECIALLY IN THE MILITARY, AND YOU JUST KIND OF, "SORRY TO HEAR THAT," AND YOU HOPE THEY WORK THROUGH IT. YOU JUST DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT. THOUGH JAMES IS BLISSFULLY UNAWARE OF HIS WIFE'S INDISCRETIONS, THE AFFAIR IS CUT SHORT WHEN HE GETS A NEW POSTING IN YUMA, ARIZONA. YUMA, ARIZONA IS A BIG TRAINING BASE FOR THE MARINE CORPS. I WAS A STAFF, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICER. I WALKED IN AND IMMEDIATELY I'M THE SENIOR ENLISTED GUY IN CHARGE. FOR WENDY AND THE GIRLS, BEING BACK STATESIDE IS A WELCOME CHANGE FROM UNFAMILIAR JAPAN. I LOVED THAT IT WAS AN OUTDOOR SCHOOL, AND THEN I GOT MY OWN FRIENDS. MY GOODNESS, SO MANY MEMORIES. MOM WAS ALWAYS THERE, ALWAYS PLAYING WITH US. DAD WAS MORE THE JOKESTER. IT WAS FUN, BEING JUST A KID. THE FAMILY QUICKLY STARTS TO BUILD A COMMUNITY IN THEIR NEW HOME, INCLUDING NEIGHBORS LARRY AND SHELLY FRAMNESS. WE FIRST MET THEM WHEN WE MOVED INTO OUR BASE HOUSE, IN THE OFFICER SECTION OF THE BASE. LARRY WAS REAL BIG INTO COMPUTERS, REAL BIG INTO GAMING. HE WAS KIND OF WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A GEEK. HIS WIFE WAS GREAT. HE HAD GREAT CHILDREN. THEY LIVED PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HOUSES DOWN FROM US. THEY HAD TWO LITTLE GIRLS, ONE WHICH WAS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN MY SISTER WAS, AND A LITTLE GIRL THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH AROUND MY AGE. THOUGH THEIR SURROUNDINGS HAVE IMPROVED, JAMES' WORK SCHEDULE HASN'T. NOW THAT I AM OLDER, I KIND OF KNOW NOW THAT WHEN MY DAD WAS GONE, MY MOM WAS LONELY, AND SHE'S STUCK WITH TWO KIDS AND STAYING AT HOME, AND WHAT'S SHE GOING TO DO ALL DAY? I UNDERSTAND. I'LL BE THERE. HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING TO BE GONE THIS TIME? I DON'T KNOW. IT WAS VERY DEMANDING. I WAS A BRAND-NEW WARRANT OFFICER. OBVIOUSLY, I WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT THING, SO THERE WAS A LOT OF LONG HOURS. AFTER 9/11, WHEN THE TWIN TOWERS FALL IN NEW YORK CITY, JAMES IS SHIPPED OUT TO THE MIDDLE EAST, LEAVING WENDY TO FEND FOR HERSELF AND THE CHILDREN. WE WERE GOING TO KUWAIT, AND OUR JOB WAS TO BE IN PLACE SO WE COULD RESPOND ANYWHERE IN THE AREA IF THERE WAS WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION FOUND. WHILE JAMES DEALS WITH A NATIONAL TRAGEDY, WENDY IS HIT WITH A PERSONAL TRAGEDY OF HER OWN. THIS WAS A TRULY TERRIBLE TIME FOR WENDY. HER MOTHER, WHO HAD BEEN ONE OF THE ROCKS OF HER LIFE, DIED. SHE FELL INTO A DEPRESSION AND HAD A TERRIBLE TIME RECOVERING FROM IT. MY MOM AND HER MOM, WE CALLED HER MAMA. THEY WERE EXTREMELY CLOSE. THEY TALKED EVERY DAY, ALL THE TIME. AND ONCE SHE PASSED AWAY, THAT KIND OF - - MOM HIT ROCK BOTTOM, PRETTY MUCH. WENDY TRIES TO LEAN ON JAMES, BUT HER HUSBAND'S FOCUS IS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SUPPORT THE OTHER PERSON, BUT YOU'RE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS, AND YOU AND YOUR MEN MIGHT BE GOING INTO HARM'S WAY AT ANY MOMENT. I KNOW IT SOUNDS CALLOUS, BUT IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS. SO, INSTEAD, WENDY FINDS SOLACE IN NEIGHBOR LARRY FRAMNESS. ONCE MY DAD WAS DEPLOYED, I REMEMBER LARRY COMING AROUND A LOT MORE. AND HE AND MY MOM WOULD TALK AND KIND OF HANG OUT. IT WAS GENUINE JUST FRIENDSHIP, AND SHE HAD SOMEONE THERE, AND THEY KIND OF CLICKED. WE WOULD GO OVER THERE AND WATCH MOVIES. WHILE DAD WAS GONE, HE HELPED MY SISTER AND I WITH PROJECTS FOR SCHOOL. HE WAS VERY NICE, VERY FRIENDLY, GOOD WITH KIDS, OBVIOUSLY HE HAD TWO OF HIS OWN. HE WAS THERE TO HELP US WHEN MY DAD WASN'T. WENDY DESCRIBED JAMES AS BEING A BIT ALOOF, EMOTIONALLY UNATTACHED, AND IN LARRY SHE FOUND THE OPPOSITE. LARRY WAS ALWAYS WILLING TO LISTEN, AND HE BECAME HER CONFIDANTE. AFTER MONTHS OF BEING AWAY, JAMES RETURNS TO YUMA AND IS READY TO SETTLE BACK INTO OLD ROUTINES. BUT HIS HOMECOMING IS MARRED BY A SHOCKING ALLEGATION. MRS. FRAMNESS MADE THE INITIAL COMPLAINT TO THE COMMAND THAT SHE BELIEVED HER HUSBAND AND MS. WENDY GLASS WERE ENGAGED IN AN ADULTEROUS AFFAIR. UNDER THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE, ADULTERY IS A CHARGEABLE AND PUNISHABLE CRIME. THE MARINES AND SAILORS SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THEIR MISSION. THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A COWORKER, A SUBORDINATE, A SUPERIOR TRYING TO WOO THEIR SPOUSE WHILE THEY'RE DEPLOYED. MAKING MATTERS WORSE, RUMORS ABOUT THE AFFAIR ARE SWIRLING AROUND THE BASE. MY HUSBAND AND I WERE LIKE, "THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON." IT WAS LITTLE THINGS. WHEN JAMES WOULD BE GONE, LARRY WOULD BE AT THE HOUSE, HELPING OUT, BUT, AT ONE POINT, WENDY CAME TO VISIT ME IN SAN DIEGO AND SHE WAS DRIVING LARRY'S TRUCK. I THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING, BUT I DIDN'T ASK A LOT ABOUT IT. THEY ACTUALLY ASSIGNED AN INVESTIGATION, AND THEY CAME AND INTERVIEWED ME, AND I TOLD THEM ABSOLUTELY NOT. THIS IS ABSURD. WHOEVER IS LEVELING THIS ACCUSATION IS OUT OF THEIR MIND. I COULD NOT EVEN FATHOM THAT WENDY WOULD DO THAT, SO I PUSHED BACK STRONGLY THAT THOSE ALLEGATIONS WERE FALSE. LARRY AND WENDY ALSO DENIED THE AFFAIR, TELLING OFFICIALS THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS FRIENDLY AND NOTHING ELSE. INVESTIGATORS DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO DOUBT THEM. LARRY FRAMNESS HAD A VERY CLEAN CAREER UP TILL THAT POINT. AND WHEN WE RESPONDED, NOBODY INVOLVED MADE A VOLUNTARY STATEMENT OR ADMITTED ANY KIND OF GUILT OR WRONGDOING. THEREFORE, THE COMMAND'S HANDS WERE TIED AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE FORWARD JUST BASED ON ALLEGATION. THE INVESTIGATION IS DROPPED AND THE RUMORS DIE DOWN. LIFE FOR BOTH FAMILIES SEEMS TO RETURN TO NORMAL. WENDY? YOU HOME? BUT IN EVERY RUMOR LIES A LITTLE BIT OF TRUTH, AND WHEN IT GETS REVEALED, THERE WILL BE A PRICE TO PAY. HE WAS FURIOUS. HE SAID, "I WANTED TO KILL HER." NO! HEY. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IN THE WINTER OF 2002, THE MILITARY DROPS ITS INVESTIGATION INTO POTENTIAL ADULTERY BETWEEN WENDY GLASS AND LARRY FRAMNESS. FOR WENDY'S HUSBAND, JAMES, IT'S THE OUTCOME HE EXPECTED ALL ALONG. I COULD NOT EVEN FATHOM THAT WENDY WOULD DO THAT, SO I PUSHED BACK STRONGLY THAT THOSE ALLEGATIONS WERE FALSE. BUT ALL THAT CHANGES WHEN JAMES DECIDES TO SURPRISE HIS WIFE FOR DINNER. I HAD COME BACK FROM MY DEPLOYMENT TO KUWAIT AND I WAS BACK AT THE OFFICE, AND I CAME HOME A LITTLE BIT EARLY. WENDY? YOU HOME? I HEARD SOMETHING, AND I WALKED UPSTAIRS. I WASN'T TRYING TO BE QUIET OR ANYTHING. I FIGURED SHE WAS UPSTAIRS. AND SHE WALKED OUT OF THE BEDROOM NAKED. HI! HEY. HI, HONEY. HOW ARE YOU? I'M FINE. I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING UP HERE. YOU OKAY? YEAH, IT'S JUST ME. THAT'S VERY ODD. I WAS GOING TO GO TAKE A SHOWER. OKAY. YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I'M FINE. SHE KEPT TRYING TO DISTRACT ME. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU CAN DO ME A FAVOR. ALL RIGHT. I'M REALLY HUNGRY, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD GO MAKE ME A SANDWICH. IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON HERE? NO. HOLD ON A SECOND. WHAT? I THOUGHT I HEARD SOMETHING. NO, NOTHING. WHAT THE? NO! I WALKED INTO THE BEDROOM, AND I SAW LARRY TRYING TO HIDE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BED. THAT WAS A BETRAYAL THAT REALLY HIT TO THE CORE OF ME. IT WAS NOT ONLY A BETRAYAL OF MY WIFE, IT WAS A BETRAYAL OF A FELLOW MARINE, ONE THAT I HAD BEEN TRAINED TO DEPEND ON. I DIDN'T TRUST MYSELF TO SAY ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING AT THAT MOMENT. I JUST LEFT. I LEFT, GOT IN MY CAR, AND JUST DROVE. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS GO DIRECTLY TO THE COMMAND AND TELL THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED, BUT WENDY CALLED ME. I WENT BACK TO THE HOUSE. WENDY TELLS JAMES SHE COULDN'T COUNT ON HIM FOR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT, PINNING SOME OF THE BLAME ON HER HUSBAND. YOU COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING IF YOU WERE UNHAPPY! WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? YOU'RE NEVER HERE. YOU WANT ME TO JUST PICK UP AND GO ALL THE TIME. SO NOW YOU'RE THE VICTIM? YES. I WALKED IN ON YOU WITH OUR NEIGHBOR, AND YOU'RE THE VICTIM? SHE EXPLAINED THAT THERE WAS A WEAK POINT WHENEVER HER MOM DIED AND THEY STARTED HAVING THE AFFAIR. LOOK, IT WAS STUPID. ALL I KNOW IS THAT I'M SORRY. AND I LOVE YOU. ON AN ACADEMIC LEVEL, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HER NEEDING HUMAN CONTACT. ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, I WON'T SAY IT WAS UNFORGIVABLE BUT IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE. IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE BETRAYAL. HE JUST SEEMED REALLY SAD. AND I'M LIKE, "ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?" HE SAYS, "NOT RIGHT NOW, NO." OKAY, SO WE'LL TRY TO GIVE HIM HIS SPACE, BECAUSE HE NEEDED IT. THOUGH THE HURT RUNS DEEP, JAMES' LOVE OF FAMILY RUNS FAR DEEPER. I WAS VERY, VERY SCARED OF LOSING MY CHILDREN, BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS IN A DEPLOYABLE STATUS, AND IF SHE LEFT AND TOOK THE CHILDREN, THAT I WOULD SEE THEM VERY RARELY. HE WAS SCARED TO DEATH WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, AND HE TOLD WENDY THAT HE WANTED TO WORK IT OUT. JAMES AGREES TO KEEP THE INDISCRETIONS TO HIMSELF, AND WENDY PROMISES THE AFFAIR IS OVER. SHELLY FRAMNESS, LARRY'S WIFE, ISN'T AS FORGIVING. SHELLY DECIDED TO DIVORCE LARRY AND MOVE WITH THE CHILDREN BACK TO MONTANA. SHE TOOK HIS KIDS, AND HE WAS DEVASTATED. AND WE WERE ALL LIKE, MY GOD. JAMES AND WENDY CUT ALL TIES TO LARRY, VOWING TO WORK ON THEIR MARRIAGE, BUT THE DAMAGE IS OBVIOUS. WE STARTED SEEING A COUNSELOR, BUT THE TRUST IS GONE. AND TRUST IS CRITICAL IN A RELATIONSHIP. AND IF TRUST ISN'T THERE, YOU'RE NEVER AS CLOSE AS A COUPLE. THEIR CHILDREN, NICOLE AND ANDREA, NOW EIGHT AND TEN, ARE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG. I FEEL LIKE THEY LOVED EACH OTHER, THEY JUST WERE NOT IN LOVE ANYMORE. THEY DIDN'T SNUGGLE UP A LOT OR KISS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I REMEMBER SITTING ON THE STAIRS SOMETIMES AND HEARING THEM FIGHT. I ALWAYS THOUGHT MY PARENTS WERE GOING TO GET THROUGH IT. SLOWLY BUT SURELY, THINGS BETWEEN WENDY AND JAMES IMPROVE. DISTANCE AND TIME IS ALWAYS A FACTOR IN OVERCOMING TRAUMATIC EVENTS LIKE THIS, BUT THERE WAS STILL, IN THE BACK OF MY MIND, THE SUSPICION, THE HURT. IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOW, THOUGH JAMES' WORK SCHEDULE REMAINS GRUELING, WENDY APPEARS TO MAKE THE MOST OF HIS TIME HOME. I WAS COMING BACK FROM A DEPLOYMENT WHERE YOU WERE WORKING 18 HOURS A DAY, AND THAT WAS REALLY THE FIRST TIME THAT I HAD HAD ANY TIME OFF IN A LONG TIME. WENDY HAD PLANNED A WEEKEND IN LAGUNA MOUNTAINS. IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. IT IS SO DIFFERENT FROM BEING IN THE MIDDLE EAST - - TALL PINE TREES, JUST LUSHNESS. IT'S FANTASTIC. SO WE WENT AND WE HAD DINNER WITH SOME VERY DEAR FRIENDS OF MINE, HAD DRINKS, AND WE DROVE UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS THERE BETWEEN SAN DIEGO AND ARIZONA, TO A LITTLE CABIN. WE HAD A VERY ROMANTIC WEEKEND. I THOUGHT IT WAS GREAT. IT FELT LIKE THINGS WERE GETTING BACK TO NORMAL. KIND OF FIGURED WE COULD USE A LITTLE ALONE TIME. ALL RIGHT. YOU DON'T NEED THAT RIGHT NOW. WHAT SEEMS LIKE A NEW BEGINNING FOR JAMES AND WENDY WILL SOON BE RECALLED AS THE BEGINNING OF THE END. I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE TURNING POINT OF EVERYTHING. BEGINS AS AN EMOTIONAL LIFE RAFT, AND THEN BECOMES SOMETHING FAR MORE DANGEROUS. IN NOVEMBER OF 2002, WENDY GLASS SURPRISES HER HUSBAND, JAMES, WITH A ROMANTIC WEEKEND IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S LAGUNA MOUNTAINS. IT'S BEEN A ROUGH FEW MONTHS, BUT JAMES BELIEVES IT'S A SIGN HIS MARRIAGE HAS BOUNCED BACK AFTER WENDY'S INFIDELITY. THEY WERE GOING TO STAY IN A CABIN. THEY WERE GOING TO GO HAVE COCKTAILS AT THE NEARBY CASINO, AND IT WAS GOING TO BE A NICE RETREAT FOR THEM BECAUSE HE HAD JUST RETURNED FROM DEPLOYMENT. BUT JAMES IS SEVERELY STRESSED AND JETLAGGED, NOT THE BEST RECIPE FOR ROMANCE. WE HAD DINNER, I HAD A FEW DRINKS, BUT, LATER ON, I HAD TROUBLE GOING TO SLEEP BECAUSE OF THE TIME DIFFERENCE. HEY. GOT SOME PILLS FOR YOU TO GET YOUR SLEEP. HERE. WENDY SAID THAT SHE HAD SOMETHING TO HELP ME SLEEP, AND I TOOK IT. THE PILLS HAVE VERY LITTLE EFFECT, AND BY THE NEXT DAY THE COUPLE HEADS HOME, FEELING WENDY'S ROMANTIC GESTURE HAS FALLEN FLAT. ON THE WAY BACK TO YUMA, I FELT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GUILT BECAUSE WE WERE WORKING ON OUR MARRIAGE AND TRYING TO REBUILD THAT TRUST, REBUILD THE FAITH, TRYING OUR BEST. THEY CAME BACK EARLY, AND I WAS LIKE, "YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS HAVE SOME FUN AND WHATEVER?" "IT WAS OKAY." HE WAS LIKE, "I FELT TERRIBLE ALL DAY." IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE IT WAS THIS ROMANTIC GETAWAY THAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. THINGS ONLY GET WORSE FOR WENDY AND JAMES WHEN THE MARINE IS DEPLOYED ONCE AGAIN. I WAS SENT OFF TO KUWAIT, AND THE MINUTE I GET THERE WE'RE ON A 24-HOUR SCHEDULE, WE'RE RAMPING UP, SO IT'S ZERO TO 60 AND JUST NOTHING. IT WAS A VERY STRESSFUL DEPLOYMENT. AND THIS TIME, THERE'S NO TELLING HOW LONG JAMES WILL BE GONE. I LEFT WENDY AT A VERY VULNERABLE TIME. IT WAS VERY BRUTAL BECAUSE THE TRUST WASN'T THERE. SHE SEEMED TO LOVE HER HUSBAND AND HER KIDS, BUT SHE ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE SHE WAS NEVER QUITE SATISFIED WITH HER LIFE, LIKE SHE FELT SHE DESERVED MORE, BETTER, DIFFERENT, I DON'T KNOW. I'M LIKE, "LOOK, THIS IS THE LIFE YOU GOT. MAKE IT WORK." THOUGH HE'S THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY, JAMES TRIES TO STAY CONNECTED AT HOME. WE ARE IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET, SO WE DID HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTERS AND WE COULD SEND E-MAILS BACK HOME, AND WE DID HAVE PHONES. SO I TRIED TO MAKE MORE OF A CONCERTED EFFORT TO CALL HOME. HEY, HONEY. IT'S ME. I GUESS YOU'RE ASLEEP ALREADY. SORRY I MISSED YOU, BUT I'LL TRY BACK TOMORROW. JUST GIVE THE GIRLS A KISS FOR ME, OKAY? SOMETIMES IT'S HARD. YOU'LL GO THERE AND THE LINE IS TEN- OR 12-DEEP OF PEOPLE WANTING TO TALK TO THEIR FAMILIES. TWO WEEKS INTO HIS DEPLOYMENT, JAMES IS SURPRISED TO SEE A FAMILIAR FACE WALKING THE HALLS OF THE STATION COMMAND... JAMES. ...LARRY FRAMNESS. THE MILITARY WAS AMASSING IN KUWAIT, WAITING FOR THE ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO MOVE ACROSS AND TAKE DOWN SADDAM HUSSEIN, AND A LOT OF THEM WERE GOING TO ALI AL SALEM, THE BIG AIR BASE THERE. THEY'RE BOTH PART OF THE SAME AVIATION COMMAND, SO WHEN ONE GOES, IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT THE OTHER WENT. WE HAD REGULAR MEETINGS WITH STAFF AND THE COMMANDING OFFICER. THOUGH THERE'S NO LOVE LOST BETWEEN THE TWO MEN, JAMES DOES WELCOME LARRY'S ARRIVAL. THERE WAS A SENSE OF RELIEF THAT LARRY WAS DEPLOYED THERE. BECAUSE HE WAS NOT HOME, I COULD QUIT WORRYING ABOUT THAT. IT'S ONE OF THOSE ITEMS WHERE KEEP YOUR ENEMIES CLOSE. CAN I TALK TO YOU FOR A SECOND? ABOUT WHAT? LISTEN, MAN, I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE THE PAST BEHIND. WHAT DO YOU SAY? HE TRIED TO EXPLAIN THAT IT WAS A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS, AND HE APOLOGIZED, BUT THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT MARINES DON'T DO TO OTHER MARINES. I DID NOT TRUST HIM. I TRIED TO KEEP HIM AT A DISTANCE. I DID NOT WANT HIM NEXT TO ME. MY UNIT SPENT ALMOST 30 DAYS FORWARD DEPLOYED INTO IRAQ, AND SO WE HAD COME BACK OUT OF IRAQ. LARRY HAD COME TO ME AND SAID THAT THERE WAS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY GOING ON. HE DIDN'T ELABORATE ON WHAT IT WAS, BUT HE WANTED A FELLOW OFFICER TO OBSERVE IT. THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THIS AREA, AND SO JAMES AND LARRY WERE GOING TO GO OUT THERE TO OBSERVE IT AND POSSIBLY CORRECT THE PROBLEM. HE HAD TOLD ME THAT HE WAS GOING TO COME GET ME, AND HE CAME SOMEWHERE AROUND 11:00 AT NIGHT. HE LED ME TO THIS BUNKER THAT WE HAD IN CASE OF ROCKET ATTACK, MORTAR ATTACK, THAT THE MARINES WOULD BE ABLE TO GO INTO. I HAD AN INKLING THAT THINGS WEREN'T EXACTLY RIGHT, BUT THERE WEREN'T CLEAR ALARM BELLS GOING OFF. SO WE WENT DOWN INTO THE BUNKER AND WE STAYED DOWN THERE FOR A FEW MINUTES, BUT I'M NOT SEEING WHAT I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO SEE. NEXT THING I KNOW, AN EXPLOSION WENT OFF. I WAS BLOWN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING. I COULDN'T SEE. I COULDN'T HEAR. HE'S DOWN. HE'S BLEEDING. THERE'S A LOT OF SHRAPNEL - - ARMS, LEGS, CHEST. JAMES IS SEVERELY WOUNDED, AND YET HE SURVIVES. THE EXPLOSION IGNITES AN INVESTIGATION THAT WILL REVEAL A SINISTER PLOT, ONE THAT HAS BEEN MONTHS IN THE MAKING. THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THREE PLANS. JAMES WAS ABSOLUTELY OBLIVIOUS. I DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WAS ANY POSSIBLE WAY THAT THIS COULD GET WORSE. 33-YEAR-OLD MARINE JAMES GLASS HAS JUST SURVIVED A MASSIVE EXPLOSION ON-BASE IN KUWAIT. AS MILITARY OFFICIALS SCRAMBLE TO FIND ANSWERS, JAMES IS LUCKY TO BE ALIVE. BECAUSE THAT GRENADE FELL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PALLETIZED WATER BOTTLES, A LOT OF THE CONCUSSION WAS ABSORBED BY THE WATER, AND THE SHRAPNEL WAS SLOWED AS IT PASSED THROUGH THE BOTTLES. I REMEMBER, JUST SURVIVAL WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND. I STUMBLED OUT OF THE BUNKER TO SEEK MEDICAL HELP. AND LARRY WAS THERE, AND HE HAD THIS TREMENDOUS SHOCKED LOOK ON HIS FACE. AND SO HE HELPED ME ACTUALLY GET TO THE TENT WHERE MEDICAL HELP WAS. JAMES IS AIRLIFTED TO A HOSPITAL IN SPAIN, WHERE HE UNDERGOES SURGERY TO REMOVE SHRAPNEL FROM HIS ARMS, NECK, AND LEGS. BACK IN YUMA, WENDY BREAKS THE SHOCKING NEWS TO HER DAUGHTERS, ANDREA AND NICOLE. I REMEMBER MY MOM SITTING MY SISTER AND I DOWN ON THE COUCH, AND WAS LIKE, "GIRLS, YOUR DAD WAS HURT BUT HE'S OKAY." WE WERE COMPLETELY CONFUSED. WE'RE LIKE, "WHAT DO YOU MEAN HE'S HURT? WHERE IS HE? WHAT'S GOING ON?" I HAD NO IDEA ANYTHING WAS GOING ON. I WAS SCARED, AS ANY CHILD WOULD BE WHEN THEY HEAR THEIR PARENT'S HURT. BUT MOM SAID THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE OKAY, THAT EVERYTHING WAS GOING TO BE OKAY. MEANWHILE, IN KUWAIT, INVESTIGATORS WORK TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT HAPPENED. LARRY WAS DETAINED AND HE WAS QUESTIONED. DID YOU SEE ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS ON BASE THAT NIGHT? I GUESS AL-QAEDA DID IT. LARRY'S EXPLANATION IS THIS WAS AN ATTACK BY A TERRORIST, AN AL-QAEDA OPERATIVE. BUT HIS STORY ISN'T ADDING UP. THERE IS AN EXPLOSION ON A BASE WHERE YOU DON'T EXPECT THERE TO BE AN EXPLOSION. YOU'RE IN KUWAIT, YOU'RE NOT IN IRAQ. OUR INTEL INDICATES THERE WAS NO OPERATIVES WORKING AT THAT TIME. WHAT ARE YOU NOT TELLING ME? AS THE PRESSURE MOUNTS, LARRY BREAKS. WELL, SIR... I THREW THE GRENADE. WITHIN AN HOUR OR SO, HE CONFESSED TO ROLLING IN A GRENADE IN AN ATTEMPT TO KILL CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER JAMES GLASS SO THAT HE COULD BE WITH GLASS' WIFE/WIDOW, WENDY, BACK IN CALIFORNIA. HIS CONFESSION UNRAVELS A PLOT THAT'S BEEN MONTHS IN THE MAKING. JAMES WAS OF THE MIND THAT THIS AFFAIR BETWEEN LARRY AND WENDY, WHICH HAD BEEN VERY TROUBLING TO HIM, WAS SOMETHING IN THE PAST. WELL, THE AFFAIR WASN'T OVER. LARRY AND WENDY HAD DETERMINED THAT JAMES WAS WORTH MORE DEAD THAN HE WAS ALIVE. THEIR PLAN WAS TO MURDER HIM FOR HIS INSURANCE MONEY. IN FACT, THEY STOOD TO GAIN OVER $500,000 FROM HIS INSURANCE POLICIES. IN A SEARCH OF LARRY'S BELONGINGS, WE FOUND A HANDWRITTEN NOTE WHICH WAS DETERMINED TO CONTAIN THE HANDWRITING OF WENDY AND LARRY, WHICH BASICALLY ITEMIZED EVERY LIFE INSURANCE POLICY JAMES HAD WITH WENDY AS A BENEFICIARY. THEY HAD ITEMIZED EVERYTHING THAT THEY WERE INTENDING TO PURCHASE AFTER JAMES WAS DEAD. LARRY FRAMNESS IS TAKEN INTO MILITARY POLICE CUSTODY WHILE INVESTIGATORS TRAVEL TO YUMA TO QUESTION WENDY GLASS. I WAS UNHAPPY BUT I NEVER WANTED TO KILL HIM. DURING THE INITIAL INTERVIEW, WENDY DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT. SHE PORTRAYED HERSELF AS A GOOD MILITARY SPOUSE WHOSE HUSBAND WAS INJURED. AS WE'RE JUST LOOKING AROUND WHILE WE'RE TALKING TO HER, WE START NOTICING OBJECTS THAT BELONG TO LARRY FRAMNESS ARE ACTUALLY INSIDE HER HOUSE. WE ASK HER FOR PERMISSION TO SEARCH HER ENTIRE RESIDENCE AFTER THAT, AND WE FOUND THE E-MAILS BETWEEN LARRY AND WENDY THAT WERE VERY INCRIMINATING: PROFESSING THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER, TALKING ABOUT FUTURE PLANS. WITH THE EVIDENCE PILING UP, WENDY HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE A CONFESSION OF HER OWN. WENDY INDICATED THAT IF SHE DIVORCED HER HUSBAND, HE WOULD TAKE THE CHILDREN, AND LARRY HAD CONVINCED HER THAT SHE COULD BE VERY HAPPY WITH LARRY AND WITH ALL THAT MONEY. A WEEK AFTER THE EXPLOSION, WENDY IS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER. WHEN WE ARRESTED HER, SHE WASN'T SURPRISED. SHE FELT SORRY FOR HERSELF. SHE BECAME EMOTIONAL. AS HE RECOVERS FROM SURGERY, JAMES LEARNS THE DEVASTATING NEWS. I REMEMBER ASKING THE COMMANDING OFFICER WHAT HAPPENED, BECAUSE, AT THAT TIME, I STILL DIDN'T HAVE AN INKLING. AND HE TOLD ME, "FRAMNESS DID IT." HEY, BROTHER, LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT, BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT LARRY AND WENDY HAVE BEEN ARRESTED FOR DOING THIS TO YOU. EVERYTHING CLICKED. IT WAS A MOMENT OF CLARITY. THE SENSE OF BETRAYAL THAT I HAD EXPERIENCED EARLIER, IT WAS NOWHERE NEAR WHAT I WAS EXPERIENCING AT THAT TIME. MY WORLD DROPPED OUT FROM UNDERNEATH ME. BUT I WAS NOT GOING TO LET THIS DEFINE MY LIFE. WHEN JAMES IS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL A FEW WEEKS LATER, HE DOES SOMETHING HE NEVER THOUGHT HE'D DO - - HE FILES FOR DIVORCE. THE MILITARY HAS WHAT IS CALLED AN ARTICLE 32 HEARING, AND IT'S KIND OF EQUIVALENT TO A GRAND JURY. SO DURING THE ARTICLE 32 HEARING, I'M SITTING THERE AND I'M CALLED AS A WITNESS, AND IT'S IN FRONT OF A JUDGE. BEING A MARINE, BEING A MAN, I HAD TO FIGHT THE URGE TO WRAP MY HANDS AROUND HIS THROAT, BECAUSE HE HAD DESTROYED MY WORLD. I REMEMBER THE TRIAL WAS IN TUCSON, I BELIEVE, AND WE WERE STAYING IN A HOTEL. AND I REMEMBER SITTING DOWN IN THE HOTEL ROOM, MY SISTER AND I FLIPPING THROUGH CHANNELS, AND THERE IT WAS ON TV. SO THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE EVER KNEW SOMETHING WAS REALLY WRONG. AS THE PROSECUTION MAKES ITS CASE, JAMES IS SURPRISED TO LEARN JUST HOW LUCKY HE IS TO BE ALIVE BECAUSE THE BOMB WASN'T THE FIRST ATTEMPT ON HIS LIFE. WENDY GLASS AND LARRY FRAMNESS HAD CONSPIRED TO MURDER JAMES GLASS IN THE LAGUNA MOUNTAINS OF CALIFORNIA. THEY HAD SCHEMED TO TAKE HIM TO THE MOUNTAINS AND GET HIM DRUNK, AND THEN PUT HIM BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A MOTOR VEHICLE AND LAUNCH HIM OVER A CLIFF. SO IT WASN'T REALLY A ROMANTIC GETAWAY. THEY SOLD IT TO HIM AS, "HEY, WELCOME BACK FROM THE DEPLOYMENT," BUT, UNBEKNOWNST TO JAMES, LARRY WAS IN THE AREA AND HE WAS THERE TO ASSIST IN THE MURDER. THAT PILL THAT WENDY HAD GIVEN ME TO HELP ME SLEEP WAS ACTUALLY THE DATE RAPE DRUG, BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT ON ME. WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BONDING PROCESS BETWEEN WENDY AND I, IT HAD JUST BEEN AN EFFORT TO KILL ME. LARRY FRAMNESS IS SENTENCED TO 25 YEARS IN PRISON FOR CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER. WENDY GLASS TAKES A PLEA DEAL WITH PROSECUTORS AND IS SENTENCED TO SEVEN YEARS IN PRISON IN EXCHANGE FOR TESTIFYING AGAINST THE DISGRACED MARINE. PER HER PLEA AGREEMENT, WENDY WAS REQUIRED TO ADMIT FULL CULPABILITY, AND SHE DID SO. I REMEMBER MOM SITTING DOWN AND SAYING SHE WAS GOING TO GO AWAY FOR A WHILE, THAT SHE LOVED US AND ALWAYS WOULD. AS I GOT OLDER, I TOOK IT UPON MYSELF TO TRY AND FIND OUT WHY. AND I HAD CAUGHT THE CLIPPINGS FROM THE NEWS REPORTS, AND I HAD TO FIND OUT THE HARD WAY. I WAS ANGRY AT THE SITUATION. I WAS ANGRY AT BOTH MY PARENTS. AND I WAS ANGRY BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW. IT WAS A WEIRD TRANSITION TO GO FROM HER BEING AROUND, JUST BEING HER GOOFY SELF, DANCING AROUND THE HOUSE, TO HER NOT BEING THERE. I RESENTED HER FOR LEAVING, SO THAT WE DIDN'T TALK FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IN JANUARY OF 2005, JAMES'S DIVORCE FROM WENDY BECOMES FINAL. I DON'T REGRET THE MARRIAGE BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT OF YEARS, WE HAD TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS. IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO BE ABLE TO TRUST ANYBODY AGAIN.
