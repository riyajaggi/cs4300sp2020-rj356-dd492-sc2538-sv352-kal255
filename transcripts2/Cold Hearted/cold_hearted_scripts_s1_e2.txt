 IN 1975, A COUPLE FROM RURAL INDIANA SNEAK OFF TO LOVERS' LANE. IT WAS TWO YOUNG PEOPLE AND TWO YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE IN LOVE. MY GOD. BUT THEIR NIGHT OF PASSION TURNS INTO A MURDER MYSTERY SHROUDED IN JEALOUSY, REVENGE, AND MANIPULATION. THE MURDER WAS, FOR KNOX COUNTY, LIKE THE O. J. MURDER FOR THE UNITED STATES. THINGS WERE OUT OF CONTROL. ANYTHING THAT HE WANTED HER TO DO, SHE WOULD DO. WHEN THE POWER OF LOVE GETS TWISTED,

 IT BECOMES A DEADLY AFFAIR. SHE WAS AN INNOCENT PERSON, AND WE GOT AWAY SCOT-FREE. IN THE HEART OF INDIANA FARM COUNTRY IS THE SMALL CITY OF VINCENNES. FOR 23-YEAR-OLD SHERRY GIBSON, IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE TO CALL HOME. SHERRY MOVED TO VINCENNES TO BE A DATA PROCESSOR AT THE HOSPITAL. SHE WAS JUST A SWEETHEART OF A GIRL. AND SHE'S QUICKLY MAKING FRIENDS IN HER NEW TOWN. - HOW HAVE YOU BEEN? - HOW ARE YOU? - I'M GREAT. - IT'S BEEN SO LONG. EVERYBODY LIKED SHERRY GIBSON. SHE WENT ABOUT HER BUSINESS AND WORKED

 AND HAD A LIFE SHE WANTED TO BUILD. THERE'S SOMEONE HERE I THINK YOU SHOULD MEET. SHORTLY AFTER MOVING TO TOWN, SHERRY IS INTRODUCED TO 24-YEAR-OLD LINDY ALTON. - HEY. - MY NAME'S SHERRY. - LINDY. - NICE TO MEET YOU. LINDY ALTON CAME FROM A LARGE WELL-KNOWN FAMILY IN KNOX COUNTY. HE CAME FROM A REALLY GOOD FAMILY. HE WAS KIND OF QUIET, KIND OF SHY. - I LIVE WITH MY PARENTS... - THAT'S AWESOME. - ...ON THEIR FARM. VERY COOL. RAISED ON THE FAMILY FARM, LINDY WORKS AT HIS BROTHER'S GRAVEL PIT, NOT EXACTLY THE MAN OF SHERRY'S DREAMS, BUT SHE AGREES TO GO OUT ON A DATE. HEY. YOU LOOK GREAT. THANKS FOR PICKING ME UP. LINDY WAS A NICE MAN TO BE AROUND. HE WAS VERY POLITE, SO IF YOU WENT OUT ON A DATE WITH LINDY ALTON, YOU WERE GOING TO BE GOING OUT WITH A GENTLEMAN. THROUGHOUT THE FALL AND WINTER OF '74, THEY CARRY ON A CASUAL RELATIONSHIP. SHE DATED LINDY ON AND OFF. HAVE YOU BEEN, SEEING ANYBODY? THEY HADN'T GELLED IN THE SENSE THAT THEY WERE GOING STEADY. NOT REALLY, NAH. SHE HAD DATED OTHER PEOPLE, AS WELL, AS MANY OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE DO. BY FEBRUARY OF '75, LINDY IS EAGER TO TAKE THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THEY WERE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER. THEY HAD DINNER THAT NIGHT. THEY HAD DRIVEN AROUND. I THINK THEY HAD BEEN TO A BAR OR TWO. I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME TONIGHT. THEY DECIDED, AS YOUNG PEOPLE DECIDED, THAT THEY WANTED TO HAVE SOME PRIVACY. LINDY, OF COURSE, COULDN'T TAKE HER HOME, AND SHE HAD A ROOMMATE, SO WHAT DO YOU DO? YOU PARK THE CAR. AND SO THEY HAD A SECLUDED PLACE. SOME CALLED IT A LOVERS' LANE. THAT'S WHY THEY PULLED OFF THE SIDE OF A ROAD. THEY PULL OFF THE BLACKTOP, OR GRAVEL, MAYBE, BACK THEN, FOUR, FIVE, SIX CAR LENGTHS, I GUESS, AND THEN THEY PARK. IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY SECLUDED FOR THEIR PURPOSES, BUT ANYBODY DRIVING BY COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS A VEHICLE PARKED OUT THERE. EARLY THE NEXT DAY, FARMER RON HAZELMAN SPOTS SOMETHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. A FARMER DROVE BY, AND LINDY'S CAR WAS PARKED STILL AT LOVERS' LANE. SO HE PULLED IN TO CHECK ON IT TO SEE, IS THERE A PROBLEM? DID THE CAR BREAK DOWN? HAS THERE BEEN AN ACCIDENT? AND SAW THE HOOD UP ON THE CAR. HE GLANCED OVER AND... HELP ME! HEY, I'M LOCKED IN HERE! PLEASE HELP! I'M LOCKED IN HERE. THE TRUNK WAS LOCKED, SO HE WENT AND GOT SOME TOOLS. - DID YOU GET THEM? - YES. YES, I GOT IT RIGHT HERE. EMERGING FROM THE TRUNK IS A TERRIFIED LINDY ALTON. WHERE'S SHERRY? SH-SHERRY? OVERWHELMED WITH PANIC, HE FIGHTS TO GET THE WORDS OUT. - GOT WHO? WAIT. - IT'S SHERRY! - CALM DOWN. - JUST STOP. I NEED HELP! HE HAD SUFFERED A BLOW TO THE HEAD WHEN HE WAS YOUNG, AND IT OCCASIONALLY CAUSED HIM TO HAVE CERTAIN PATTERNS IN HIS SPEECH OR DISRUPTIONS. ...ARE STILL OUT THERE WITH HER. BUT WHAT HE MANAGES TO SAY IS HORRIFYING. HE TELLS THE FARMER THAT HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS TAKEN FROM HIS VEHICLE AND HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE SHE WAS AT. WHEN POLICE ARRIVE, LINDY TRIES AGAIN TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED. A VEHICLE PULLS IN BEHIND THEM. A MAN WALKS UP TO THE DRIVER'S WINDOW. EXCUSE ME? CAN I HELP YOU? TELL ME HOW TO GET BACK TO VINCENNES. UM... SO LINDY GAVE HIM DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO GET TO VINCENNES. TAKE THIS ROAD. CONTINUE ONTO 61. AND THE GUY SAID, "WELL, THANKS," THEN HE DROVE OFF. THAT WAS WEIRD. LINDY CLAIMS HE AND SHERRY STAYED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER HOUR. WHEN THEY FINISH MAKING OUT, LINDY PUTS THE CAR IN REVERSE, STARTS TO BACK UP, AND HE LOOKS IN HIS MIRROR AND SEES A CAR BEHIND HIM WITH PARKING LIGHTS ON, AND THE NEXT THING HE KNOWS, A MAN COMES UP TO HIS SIDE... ...AND THE GUY HAD A GUN. - MY GOD. NO! - MY GOD. STAY HERE, SHERRY. IT'S OKAY. HEY! MY GOD. THE MAN FORCED HIM OUT OF THE CAR AND TOLD HIM TO SPREAD EAGLE AND PUT HIS HANDS ON THE VEHICLE. HE TOOK LINDY'S WALLET AND ACTUALLY HIT LINDY WITH A GUN. A SECOND PERSON GRABS SHERRY. MY GOD. MY GOD. NO! LINDY SAID, "DON'T HURT MY GIRLFRIEND," AND THE SUSPECT SAID, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO HURT HER." IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY, SHERRY! HE WAS FORCED OUT OF THE CAR, AND HE WAS FORCED INTO THE TRUNK. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER, BUT HE BELIEVED SHE HAD BEEN TAKEN. HE CAME, AND HE ASKED DIRECTIONS AND THEN... NOW, OF COURSE, THE POLICE ARE HEARING A STORY THAT, TO THEM, JUST... THEY ARE HAVING TROUBLE BUYING THIS. "RIGHT. YEAH. OKAY." AND LINDY'S SPEECH IMPEDIMENT IS NOT HELPING HIS CASE. THE OTHER WAS SMALL - - SHORT. HE'S STILL CONFUSED SOMEWHAT. THE DEPUTY SAID HE WAS VERY ILL. HE DIDN'T ACT EXACTLY LIKE EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE OUGHT TO ACT. THEY WOULD LOOK AT THAT AND SAY, "THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THERE." SO YOU TWO OFTEN HAVE A LOVERS' QUARREL? I MEAN, IT TOOK SEVERAL DAYS TO GET ALL THE INFORMATION FOR HIM TO RECALL WHAT OCCURRED. HEIGHTENING THEIR SUSPICIONS, THE EVIDENCE. BAD WEATHER MOVED IN OVERNIGHT, LEAVING THE GROUND SOFT AND WET, WHICH MEANS THERE SHOULD BE TRACKS FROM THE ALLEGED SECOND VEHICLE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF THIS CAR. THE WEATHER REALLY DID PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN CASTING SOME SHADOW OF A DOUBT ONTO LINDY. COULD LINDY BE LYING? THE ANSWER WILL HAVE TO WAIT. I GOT A CALL THAT THERE WAS A FIRE, AND SO I IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED. SEVEN MILES DOWN THE ROAD, FLAMES ARE CONSUMING AN OLD FARMHOUSE. AT ONE TIME, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY BEAUTIFUL HOME, AND NOBODY HAD LIVED IN IT FOR YEARS. AND I GOT DOWN THERE, AND THERE WAS A LOT OF ACTIVITY. INSIDE THIS OLD ABANDONED FARMHOUSE, THERE WAS A CHAIR THAT WAS TURNED OVER AND THEN A BODY LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAIR. THAT'S WHEN WE PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. WE'VE GOT A GIRL ABDUCTED. WE'VE GOT A GIRL MURDERED. THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHO IT WAS. THE BODY LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHAIR WAS SHERRY GIBSON. THEY HAD A REAL SITUATION ON THEIR HANDS. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN IN VINCENNES. POLICE HAVE A VERY SERIOUS CASE HERE, AND LINDY ALTON IS IN THE CROSSHAIRS FROM THAT TIME ON. HE'S TELLING THEM A STORY THAT, AT THIS POINT, IS REALLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BELIEVE. THEY'RE JUST NOT BUYING THE WHOLE THING. INVESTIGATORS ASK LINDY TO TELL HIS STORY AGAIN, THIS TIME CONNECTED TO A LIE DETECTOR. WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR... LINDY WAS GIVEN A POLYGRAPH, AND IT WAS INCONCLUSIVE. THINGS WERE NOT GOING WELL FOR LINDY. HE'S THE ONLY SUSPECT. HE'S IT. COULD SHERRY HAVE BEEN READY TO LEAVE HIM? LINDY AND SHERRY NEVER ARGUED. THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ANY PROBLEMS BETWEEN THE TWO. ARE YOU SERIOUS? IT'S... THE AUTOPSY RESULTS INDICATE THE VIOLENCE OF THE CRIME ISN'T A FIT FOR LINDY EITHER. THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS, ESSENTIALLY, THREE DEEP STAB WOUNDS INTO THE HEART. AND SHE HAD BEEN RAPED, AND THEN SHE WAS STABBED NUMEROUS PLACES ALL OVER HER BODY. SHE WENT THROUGH SUCH TORMENT AND ABUSE. EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE THAT YOU CAN THINK OF THAT'S HORRENDOUS, IT HAPPENED TO HER. BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGESTS THE KILLER ISN'T A 25-YEAR-OLD MAN LIKE LINDY ALTON. THE SEROLOGY REPORT INDICATED THAT SHE HAD HAD SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH A MALE, OBVIOUSLY, AND SECOND, IT WAS AN EXTREMELY LOW SPERM COUNT. A LOW SPERM COUNT WOULD INDICATE AN OLDER PERSON OR SOMEONE WHO HAD HAD A VASECTOMY OR SOME OTHER INJURY. IT'S ENOUGH FOR INVESTIGATORS. LINDY IS CLEARED AS A SUSPECT. I STILL HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU, BUT RELAX. SOME PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT HE MAY BE INVOLVED. I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT AT ALL. I DON'T THINK HE WAS CAPABLE. WHAT BOYFRIEND RAPES HIS GIRLFRIEND, CUTS HER BAD, BURNS HER, DRIVES FIVE MILES, FLATTENS HIS TIRE, LIFTS THE LID ON HIS CAR AND TAKES SOME WIRES OFF, THEN LOCKS HIMSELF IN THE TRUNK WITHOUT A WAY TO GET OUT? THE QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER LINDY CAN BE A VALUABLE WITNESS. HE SITS DOWN WITH A PORTRAIT ARTIST TO DRAFT A SKETCH OF THE TWO PEOPLE, A MALE AND A FEMALE, HE INSISTS APPROACHED HIS CAR. THE DYNAMIC OF THAT ALONE IS CRAZY, THAT A COUPLE DID THIS. D- DEFINITELY A WOMAN. WAS SUCH A HORRENDOUS CRIME, AND A MAN AND A WOMAN DID IT TOGETHER. THE OTHER ONE ALSO HAD GLASSES, ALSO WIRE-FRAMED. LINDY GOT AN AMAZING LOOK AT THE PEOPLE, DOWN TO MOLES ON THE FEMALE AND THE WAY THE HAIR WAS PARTED ON THE MALE. I MEAN, HE WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN HIS DESCRIPTION. HE HAD ALSO SAW A CAR, THE HEADLIGHTS, PARKING LIGHTS, AND HE GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THAT VEHICLE AND SAID IT WAS A '67 OR '68 PLYMOUTH OR DODGE. THE SKETCHES ARE RELEASED TO THE MEDIA, BUT THEY DON'T GENERATE ANY VIABLE LEADS. WE HAD A LOT OF TWISTS AND TURNS AND DEAD ENDS. I MEAN, IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING. NO! PLEASE, NO! NO! PLEASE, NO! IT WAS A HUGE CRIME, CRIME OF THE CENTURY IN KNOX COUNTY. FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS, INVESTIGATORS HAVE NO NEW LEADS. THE CASE IS ESSENTIALLY AS COLD AS IT'S GOING TO GET. THEN THE SHERIFF OF KNOX COUNTY RECEIVES A PHONE CALL THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING. I THINK, WHENEVER YOUR GIRLFRIEND GETS PREGNANT BY YOUR BEST FRIEND, THAT WOULD SCORN YOU, YES. IN MARCH 1975, A LATE NIGHT ON LOVERS' LANE ENDS WITH THE MURDER OF 23-YEAR-OLD SHERRY GIBSON... LINDY! ...AND FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS, INVESTIGATORS HAVE HAD LITTLE TO GO ON. THEN, IN AUGUST OF '77, THE SHERIFF GETS A PHONE CALL. AND IT'S AN INVESTIGATOR FROM THE INDIANA BOYS' SCHOOL, AND THE PHONE CALL IS QUESTIONING IF THERE ARE ANY UNSOLVED MURDERS IN KNOX COUNTY INVOLVING A FEMALE. THE INVESTIGATOR HAS INFORMATION ABOUT A 17-YEAR-OLD INMATE SERVING TIME IN JUVY HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. ALL THE SHERIFF KNOWS IS THAT A GUARD HAS COME FORWARD AND SAID, "I'VE GOT THIS KID HERE WHO'S BEEN TALKING TO OTHER PEOPLE SAYING HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT A MURDER IN SOUTHERN INDIANA." AND THAT YOUNG BOY WAS JOHN JEFFERS. HE WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE KIDS ALWAYS GETTING IN TROUBLE. WHEN KNOX COUNTY INVESTIGATORS MEET WITH JEFFERS, HE DENIES EVERYTHING, BUT AFTER HOURS OF QUESTIONING, HIS STORY CHANGES. HE CONFESSED TO THE WHOLE CRIME, TOLD HOW HE DID IT, VERY SQUIRRELLY YOUNG MAN. I MEAN, THEY PAID ME TO KIDNAP THIS GIRL. IT'S A BREAK IN THE CASE. THE SHERIFF DECIDES THIS IS THE KID WHO DID IT. THEN THEY TOOK THAT INFORMATION TO THE PROSECUTOR, AND CHARGES WAS FILED AGAINST JOHN JEFFERS. TO GET A CONVICTION, INVESTIGATORS WILL NEED MORE. WHO WAS WITH YOU? HE SAID HE JUST ASSISTED. HE GAVE US THE NAME OF HIS COHORT, HIS PARTNER. ALL RIGHT. IT WAS, TIMMY WILEY. MR. WILEY IS A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD SOME SMALL RUN-INS WITH THE LAW. HE AND JOHN JEFFERS WAS IN THE ORPHANS HOME HERE IN VINCENNES, INDIANA. THE TWO BECAME FRIENDS AND EVEN RAN AWAY FROM THE HOME TOGETHER. WE THOUGHT WE HAD A GOOD CASE. I HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT JEFFERS AT THAT POINT. A SEARCH FOR TIMMY WILEY FINDS HIM SERVING OVERSEAS IN THE U. S. ARMY. HE'S SERVING HONORABLY IN GERMANY. AN ARREST WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR HIM. IT'S DELIVERED TO THE UNITED STATES ARMY, AND MR. WILEY, ONE DAY, WHILE WORKING, HAS MILITARY POLICEMEN COME UP AND ARREST HIM FOR A MURDER IN KNOX COUNTY. DO YOU UNDERSTAND THESE RIGHTS AS THEY'VE BEEN READ TO YOU? YES. I UNDERSTAND. NEITHER TIMMY WILEY NOR JOHN JEFFERS IS A SOLID MATCH FOR THE COUPLE LINDY ALTON DESCRIBED. LINDY ALTON HAD SAID IT WAS A MAN AND WOMAN THAT COMMITTED THIS CRIME. DEFINITELY A WOMAN. WHERE'S THE GIRL? WHERE'S THE WOMAN? A LOT OF DOUBTS STARTED CREEPING IN. BUT WITH JOHN JEFFERS' CONFESSION, PROSECUTORS PUSH ON WITH THE CASE. THERE'S NEVER A TRIAL ON JOHN JEFFERS. JEFFERS SIGNS A PLEA AGREEMENT. HE'S GOING TO TAKE A MINIMUM FOR MURDER AND TESTIFY AGAINST MR. WILEY. GUILTY, YOUR HONOR. SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON, THE MINIMUM TURNS OUT TO BE A LOT MORE THAN JOHN JEFFERS EXPECTS. HE'S A YOUNG KID. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. HE GOES OFF TO PRISON, AND SO SUDDENLY, THOSE DOORS SLAM BEHIND HIM, AND THE REALITY SINKS IN. IN OCTOBER '78, TIMMY WILEY'S TRIAL BEGINS. HE REMAINS ADAMANT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH SHERRY GIBSON'S DEATH. NOW WILEY WOULD HAVE BEEN A JUVENILE AT THE TIME, SO WE'VE GOT TWO JUVENILES, OKAY? YET THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE POINTS TO AN OLDER MALE AS THE RAPIST. LOOKING TO SEAL THEIR CASE, THE PROSECUTOR CALLS JOHN JEFFERS TO TESTIFY. HE SAYS, "I MADE IT UP. I LIED." JEFFERS SAYS, "I DIDN'T DO THE MURDER, AND TIMMY WILEY DID NOT DO THE MURDER." THEN THE DEFENSE CALLS LINDY ALTON TO THE STAND. IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT OF THE CASE, LINDY ALTON IS BROUGHT IN THE COURTROOM, AND HE LOOKS AT MR. WILEY AND SAYS, "THIS ISN'T THE GUY." THE CASE COMPLETELY FALLS APART. IT IS ONE OF THE GREAT DISASTERS OF AMERICAN COURTROOM HISTORY. MR. GIBSON, SHERRY'S FATHER, SAID HE KNEW AT THE START THESE TWO DIDN'T DO IT. TIMMY WILEY IS RELEASED AND RETURNS TO THE ARMY. DESPITE JEFFERS' NEW CLAIM OF INNOCENCE, HE'S SENT BACK TO PRISON TO FINISH HIS SENTENCE FOR MURDER. FIVE YEARS LATER, HE GIVES UP HIS CHANCE FOR A RETRIAL. HE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF MEDICATION THAT HE OVERDOSED AND KILLED HIMSELF. YEARS AFTER JEFFERS' DEATH, THE STATE OF INDIANA RE-EXAMINES HIS CASE AND OFFICIALLY EXONERATES HIM. AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER, JEFFERS ACTUALLY WAS LIVING WITH A METHODIST MINISTER WHO ESTABLISHED AN ABSOLUTE AIRTIGHT ALIBI FOR HIM. SO, WHY DID JEFFERS CONFESS TO A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT? ANYTHING THAT COULD MAKE HIM LOOK BIG, HE WOULD ADMIT TO IT WHETHER HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT OR NOT. HE JUST WANTED ATTENTION. HE WAS JUST A KID WHO LIKED TO RUN HIS MOUTH AND MAKE UP STORIES, AND THAT'S WHAT GOT HIM INTO ALL THIS. AND JEFFERS' REASON FOR POINTING THE FINGER AT TIMMY WILEY - - REVENGE. MR. WILEY HAD ALLEGEDLY TAKEN JEFFERS' GIRLFRIEND AWAY FROM HIM. MR. WILEY GOT MR. JEFFERS' GIRLFRIEND PREGNANT. I THINK, WHENEVER YOUR GIRLFRIEND GETS PREGNANT BY YOUR BEST FRIEND, THAT WOULD SCORN YOU, YES. I THINK JOHN JEFFERS WAS SCORNED. SADLY, THE TRAGIC MURDER OF SHERRY GIBSON IS PROVING IMPOSSIBLE TO SOLVE. EVERYBODY HAD THEIR THEORY, AND THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO CONTINUED TO SAY, "WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE LINDY DID IT." NO! PLEASE, NO! "LINDY GOT AWAY WITH IT." SHERRY! GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF SHERRY! THE GOVERNMENT NEVER CAME OUT AND SAID, "LINDY ALTON IS INNOCENT." AND BECAUSE OF THAT, LINDY CANNOT ESCAPE HIS NEIGHBORS' DOUBTFUL LOOKS AND GOSSIP. ALL KINDS OF CRAZY IDEAS WERE COMING UP IN THE COMMUNITY. "HE HAD A SEIZURE. HE BLACKED OUT." "HE MURDERED HER. HE JUST DOESN'T REMEMBER." I MEAN, ALL TYPES OF THEORIES ARE BEING SPUN. THIS GUY IS WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A TARGET ON HIS BACK. NOBODY'S BELIEVING HIM. LINDY TRIES HIS BEST TO GET ON WITH HIS LIFE. HE MARRIES. HE HAS A SON. BUT TRAGEDY WILL STRIKE HIM AGAIN. IN 1998, 23 YEARS AFTER SHERRY'S MURDER, HE BURNS TO DEATH IN A BRUSHFIRE. I THINK THIS HAUNTED HIM FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. IT REALLY DID. THAT'S THE SENSE I HAD ABOUT HIM. FOR MANY, LINDY'S DEATH IS A DISHEARTENING SIGN THAT THE TRUTH MAY BE BURIED FOREVER. A BREAK IN THE CASE NOW WOULD BE NOTHING SHORT OF A MIRACLE. - HE HAS A GUN. - GET OUT OF THE CAR. NO. NO. LINDY, NO. NO. THERE WAS NOBODY THERE BUT ME TO TELL THE TRUTH. I KNEW WHO COMMITTED THAT CRIME. THE BIGGEST CRIME IN KNOX COUNTY HISTORY, THE SUICIDE OF A WRONGLY ACCUSED MAN, AND THE TRAGIC DEATH OF LINDY ALTON. MORE THAN 25 YEARS AFTER SHERRY GIBSON'S UNSOLVED MURDER, SEPARATING FACT FROM RUMOR IS IMPOSSIBLE. A LOT OF PEOPLE FELT SOMEONE HAD WALKED FREE, AND THEY KNEW DEEP IN THEIR HEART THAT A MURDERER WAS OUT THERE. THEN, IN 2001, AN UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENT REIGNITES THE INVESTIGATION. THEY HAD HAD AN INDIVIDUAL COME IN PROVIDING INFORMATION ON A HOMICIDE THAT HAD OCCURRED YEARS EARLIER. THE WOMAN CLAIMS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED ON LOVERS' LANE. SHE GOES BY THE NAME "WENDY LEWIS," AND SHE'S ASKED TO HAVE HER TRUE IDENTITY CONCEALED. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT I KNEW THIS WAS THE NEXT STEP OF SOMETHING I HAD TO DO. I HAD TO COME FORWARD. I HAD COMMITTED A MURDER, AND I HAD TO FACE UP TO THAT. TO HAVE SOMEONE COME FORWARD 25 YEARS LATER AND CLAIM THAT THEY DID IT AND THEY NEEDED TO GET IT OFF THEIR CHEST, YEAH, THAT WAS AMAZING TO HEAR. FOR INDIANA STATE POLICE DETECTIVE LARRY ECK, THE DIMINUTIVE 46-YEAR-OLD DOESN'T LOOK CAPABLE OF HURTING A FLY. SHE TALKED VERY STRONG, VERY FORWARD ON ANY QUESTION I ASKED, SEEMED VERY TRUTHFUL. THE INDIANA STATE POLICE DIDN'T REVEAL A LOT OF DETAILS ABOUT THE CRIME SCENE. SHE WAS SPOT-ON WITH EVERYTHING. SHE KNEW THINGS THAT SHE COULDN'T HAVE POSSIBLY KNOWN WITHOUT BEING THERE. I'M THINKING, "THERE'S JUST NO WAY SOMEBODY CAN KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT UNLESS THEY WERE THERE." PLUS, SHE LOOKED JUST LIKE THE COMPOSITE, SAME HEIGHT, SAME WEIGHT. WENDY TELLS INVESTIGATORS THE MURDER WAS THE CULMINATION OF A HELLACIOUS JOURNEY, ONE SHE BEGINS AS A TEENAGER LIVING ACROSS THE STATE LINE IN ILLINOIS. I WOULD WORK DURING THE WEEK, AND ON FRIDAYS, I ALWAYS KNEW WHEN HE'D GET HIS PAYCHECK THAT HE'D BE GOING OUT DRINKING. HE WOULD JUST BE EVIL, JUST MEAN AND EVIL. DESPERATE TO ESCAPE, 16-YEAR-OLD WENDY TAKES A WAITRESSING JOB. IMMEDIATELY, SHE'S SMITTEN WITH THE RESTAURANT OWNER'S SON, 29-YEAR-OLD WAYNE GULLEY. JOT IT DOWN REALLY QUICK. HE WAS SMOOTH, AND HE WAS QUICK, AND HE WAS INTELLIGENT. WELL, HE TREATED ME NICE. WE HAD A NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY AT THE RESTAURANT, AND HE PICKED ME UP AND DANCED ME AROUND. WAYNE IS MARRIED TO HIS SECOND WIFE AND ASKS WENDY OVER TO BABYSIT THE KIDS. YEAH, THANK YOU. AND THAT WAS WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST ENCOUNTER. I WAS THE GIRL FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS. NOBODY WANTED TO DATE ME OR ANYTHING, AND SO I HAD SOMEBODY THAT PAID ATTENTION TO ME, SO I WENT FOR IT. I THINK SHE WAS KNOCKED OFF HER FEET BY WAYNE. HERE COMES IN THIS EX-MARINE, AND HE'S GREGARIOUS, AND HE'S CHARMING, AND HE TREATS HER LIKE A LADY. I WANT TO BE WITH YOU. I WOULD LIKE THAT. SHE'S THINKING, "I HAVE FOUND MY KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR." WITHIN A YEAR, WAYNE DIVORCES HIS WIFE SO THE TWO CAN MARRY. YOU TALK ABOUT LOVE GONE WRONG. THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF IT. HE MARRIED HER WHEN SHE WAS A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. IN FACT, HE TOOK HER TO THE PROM, AND HE WAS 29 AND SHE WAS 17. AND HE WOULD LIKE IT WHEN I DRESSED PROVOCATIVELY, LIKE, SHORT SHORTS, MINI SHORTS, HALTER TOPS, THINGS LIKE THAT, AND HE WOULD TAKE PICTURES OF ME. I WAS STILL HEAD OVER HEELS. I DIDN'T THINK THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH HIM. WHEN THE RESTAURANT CLOSES, WAYNE FALLS BACK ON HIS TRAINING AS AN INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICIAN. SOON THE TWO ARE MOVING AROUND THE MIDWEST. ONCE SHE'S ISOLATED, WHAT DOES SHE HAVE? ALL SHE HAS IS WAYNE. HE'S EVERYTHING, HER WHOLE WORLD. HE STARTED BEING VIOLENT. HE WOULD SLAP ME. HE GRABBED A HOLD OF ME BY MY NECK AND PULLED ME UP AGAINST THE WALL AND JUST HELD ME UP AGAINST THE WALL AND CHOKING ME. IN EACH NEW TOWN, WAYNE ARRANGES FOR WENDY TO WORK, BUT IT'S NOT WAITING TABLES. HE HAD ME BECOME A STRIPPER. HE HAD ME WORKING IN THE DANCE CLUBS. HE JUST SAID THAT WAS THE ONLY KIND OF JOB THAT I COULD PROBABLY GET, AND THEN HE JOINED A SWINGING CLUB. HE SAYS, "JUST HAVE A GUY COME OVER, AND YOU HAVE SEX WITH HIM." AND SO SHE GOES SLOWLY, STEP BY STEP, INTO THE ABYSS, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF DRUGS, JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SWINGING. THERE'S ONE PARTNER THAT ENJOYED ALL OF THIS, AND THAT WAS WAYNE. SHE WAS JUST DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE TOLD HER TO DO. HE ALWAYS USED IT UNDER THE GUISE OF, "PROVE YOUR LOVE TO ME," SO SHE FELT LIKE, IN ORDER TO KEEP HIM AND IN ORDER TO KEEP HIM HAPPY, SHE HAD TO DO THESE THINGS, AND SHE HAD TO KEEP PUSHING THE ENVELOPE TO PLEASE HER MAN. I WAS DOING WHAT I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO, BUT IT STILL WASN'T ENOUGH TO PLEASE HIM. WORKING IN MASSAGE PARLORS WASN'T ENOUGH TO PLEASE HIM. BEING ALL THAT AND DOING ALL THAT, STILL, HE WAS STILL MAD AT ME AND STILL DIDN'T LIKE ME, DIDN'T LOVE ME. HE LOVED WHAT HE WAS MAKING ME TO BE. IN 1974, WAYNE TAKES A JOB AT A MINE IN SOUTHERN INDIANA. RATHER THAN MAKING A FRESH START, THE TWO HEAD DOWN AN EVEN DARKER ROAD. WE'D GO OUT DRINKING AND DRIVING AND DOING DRUGS DURING THE WEEKENDS. WE STARTED LOOKING FOR PLACES A LITTLE MORE EXCITING, AND EVERY WEEKEND WAS, "WHAT WE GOING TO DO THIS WEEKEND? WHERE WE GOING TO GO?" SO WE WOULD STAKE PLACES OUT TO GO AND ROB THEM, AND WE WOULD WAIT UNTIL IT WAS DARK, AND THEN WE'D GO ROB A PLACE IF THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THERE WORTH TAKING. IF YOU'RE AN ADRENALINE JUNKIE, YOU GOT TO KEEP PUSHING THAT ENVELOPE. THEY WERE OUT LOOKING FOR WHAT THEY COULD DO AND WHAT THEY COULD GET AWAY WITH, AND THEY WERE GETTING VERY GOOD AT IT. IT WAS THE EXCITEMENT OF NOT GETTING CAUGHT. WITH EACH NEW HOUSE, THE RISK INCREASES. THEY DID A BURGLARY OF A RESIDENCE, WHICH ENDED UP BEING A TROOPER'S RESIDENCE, STEALING HIS GUN BELT, HIS GUN, AND RIFLE. WAYNE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? POSSESSION OF THE GUN ENCOURAGES WAYNE TO ATTEMPT A MORE DANGEROUS SCORE, A MOM- AND-POP MOTEL. SEE, WE GOT AWAY. INSTEAD OF BURGLARIES, NOW WE ADVANCED IT TO INVOLVING PEOPLE. THINGS WERE GETTING OUT OF CONTROL. WEAPONS WERE BEING INVOLVED. THEY WERE ROBBING PEOPLE. THEY WERE DOING MUCH BIGGER CRIMES THAN THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY DONE. IF YOU KEEP DOING THEFTS, SOONER OR LATER, THAT THRILL IS NOT GOING TO BE AS STRONG AS AN ARMED ROBBERY OR AS STRONG AS A MURDER. I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING! ON FEBRUARY 28th, 1975, THE COUPLE'S NIGHT BEGINS JUST OUTSIDE KNOX COUNTY, INDIANA. AT AROUND 11:00 P. M., WAYNE WANTS TO GET MOVING. YOU KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO? HE SAID THAT HE WANTED TO GO GET A GIRL. THAT WAS SOMETHING THEY HAD DONE IN THE PAST, BROUGHT EXTRA PARTNERS IN. SCOOT OVER. I THOUGHT WE WAS GOING TO GO GET A GIRL FROM A HOTEL OR A BAR OR SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT. THEY HEAD DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD TAKING THEM TOWARDS THE SMALL CITY OF VINCENNES. AND THEN WE PASSED A CAR PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND HE SAYS, "WELL, LET'S GO CHECK THAT OUT." WAYNE GETS OUT AND APPROACHES THE VEHICLE. AND HE WENT UP THERE, AND HE WAS ASKING THEM SOME DIRECTIONS. SORRY ABOUT THIS. CAN YOU TELL ME HOW TO GET BACK TO VINCENNES? RETURNING TO THEIR CAR, WAYNE COMES UP WITH A PLAN. HE SAYS, "THEY WERE IN THE BACK SEAT MAKING OUT," AND HE SAYS, "DO YOU WANT TO GO BACK?" SO I'M LIKE, "GO BACK?" I'M THINKING, LIKE, "GO BACK? WHY?" IT WAS LINDY AND SHERRY. WHAT A PERFECT MAR. TWO YOUNG PEOPLE CLEARLY OUT ON LOVERS' LANE. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO? SO WAYNE AND WENDY COME BACK A SECOND TIME. THIS TIME, WAYNE DOESN'T WANT DIRECTIONS. SHERRY! BY THE WINTER OF 2001, THE MURDER OF SHERRY GIBSON IS BELIEVED TO BE UNSOLVABLE. HI. THANK YOU FOR COMING IN AND TALKING. WENDY LEWIS' APPEARANCE CHANGES THAT. I HAD TO COME FORWARD, AND THE PEOPLE THAT LOVED HER AND EVERYTHING HAD TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR CHILD, AND I WAS PART OF THE REASON WHY SHE DIED. THE OTHER PART IS HER FORMER HUSBAND, WAYNE GULLEY. AN HOUR AFTER FIRST ENCOUNTERING A COUPLE PARKED ON LOVERS' LANE, WAYNE AND WENDY RETURN. WAYNE HAD A KNIFE, AND HE HAD A GUN. HE GAVE ME THE KNIFE, AND HE TOLD ME TO GO THE PASSENGER SIDE. WAYNE APPROACHES LINDY WHILE A TERRIFIED SHERRY GIBSON LOOKS ON. - GET OUT OF THE CAR. - MY GOD. GET OUT OF THE CAR. OKAY. AND HE GOT THE MAN OUT FROM THE CAR, AND THE GIRL CAME OUT ON THE PASSENGER SIDE. HE TOLD ME TO HOLD HER. NO, NO, NO. LINDY! WAYNE SAID, "TREAT HER THE WAY I'M TREATING THE MAN"... LEAVE SHERRY ALONE. ..."SPREAD EAGLE HER. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HER WITH US." WAYNE PISTOL-WHIPS LINDY AND TAKES HIS WALLET. PLEASE, NO! PLEASE! HE PUT THE GUY IN THE TRUNK OF THE CAR, AND THEN HE TOOK THE GIRL, AND HE PUT THE GIRL IN FIRST IN OUR CAR. NO, PLEASE! NO! PLEASE, NO! I SAID, "YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU," AND SO I FELT SHE WAS MY RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO HER. - BE QUIET. - PLEASE. AS WAYNE DRIVES, WENDY FALLS IN AND OUT OF A DRUNKEN STUPOR. HE NUDGED ME AND WOKE ME UP BECAUSE SHE WAS GRABBING THE STEERING WHEEL TRYING TO MAKE HIM HAVE AN ACCIDENT. WENDY! WENDY! SO I GRABBED HER ARMS, AND I PUT HER ARMS DOWN, AND I PASSED BACK OUT AGAIN. YOU'RE GOING TO BE OKAY, OKAY? WAYNE HAD DRIVEN UP AND DOWN THAT HIGHWAY UMPTEEN TIMES, AND HE COULD SEE THIS ABANDONED FARMHOUSE, SO HE HAS IN MIND A PLACE HE CAN GO. AND THIS OLD HOUSE WOULD'VE STOOD OUT BECAUSE IT WASN'T THAT FAR OFF OF THE HIGHWAY. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, SHERRY'S ORDEAL CONTINUES. NO, PLEASE! PLEASE NO! SHE WAS STABBED NUMEROUS PLACES ALL OVER HER BODY. NO, NO, NO, NO! SHE'S CONSCIOUS AND ALIVE AS SHE'S BEING STABBED. SHE KNOWS, I MEAN, HOW HORRIFIC THIS IS, AND THIS IS A YOUNG GIRL WHO, JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS EARLIER, WAS OUT WITH FRIENDS. WENDY! WENDY, GET IN HERE! AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW IS WAKING UP. WE'RE PARKED SOMEWHERE, AND I'M THE ONLY ONE IN THE CAR BY MYSELF. WENDY HEARS WAYNE YELLING HER NAME FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE. AND HE WAS STANDING THERE, AND HE WAS MAKING THE STABBING MOTION WITH A KNIFE, AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT IS HE DOING? MY GOD." WHAT IS GOING ON? AND I SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?" AND HE SAYS, "YOU HAVE TO HELP ME," AND HE HANDED ME THE KNIFE. HERE, TAKE IT. WAYNE SAID, "YOU GOT TO FINISH HER OFF." AND HE TOLD ME WHERE TO STAB HER, AND I WAS AFRAID 'CAUSE I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM ON THIS LEVEL BEFORE. "THE ULTIMATE TEST, WENDY, OF YOUR LOVE." DO THIS. "LET ME HAND YOU THE KNIFE, AND THIS WILL SOLIDIFY US FOREVER." NO, PLEASE. I STABBED HER THREE TIMES IN THE CHEST AND THE HEART. THAT WAS WAYNE'S WAY OF CEMENTING HER LOYALTY TO HIM BECAUSE NOW SHE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO LIVE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE. HE MAY BE A KIDNAPPER AND A RAPIST, BUT SHE'S A MURDERER. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE. IT MAKES ME A BIT SICK TO MY STOMACH THAT SOMEONE COULD BE THAT WEAK THAT THEY ALLOW ANOTHER HUMAN BEING TO CONTROL THEM TO THE POINT THAT THEY WOULD COMMIT A HORRENDOUS CRIME AGAINST ANOTHER FEMALE, AGAINST ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. I'LL NEVER FORGET HER BREATHING WHEN I STABBED HER THOSE THREE TIMES, JUST THE WAY SHE WAS BREATHING. I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. I WAS HAUNTED BY THAT, THE SOUND OF HER GASPING AS I STABBED HER. I CAN STILL REMEMBER IT FROM THIS DAY, AND I TOLD HER YEARS AGO THAT I'D TAKE CARE OF HER AND NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HER. I LET HER DOWN. SHE WAS AN INNOCENT PERSON, AND HER LIFE WAS WORTH MORE THAN MY LIFE. AS THEY LEAVE, WAYNE SETS THE HOUSE ON FIRE. I HEAR YOU HAVE SOME INFORMATION. INVESTIGATORS ARE CONVINCED WENDY IS TELLING THE TRUTH, BUT AFTER 25 YEARS, THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE NEEDED TO CORROBORATE HER STORY HAS BEEN LOST. I DON'T HAVE ANY PHYSICAL EVIDENCE. I'VE GOT MY STAR WITNESS, LINDY ALTON, WHO'S DECEASED. I'VE GOT THE ONE KID PUT IN PRISON. HE'S COMMITTED SUICIDE. I'M NOT BEING DEALT A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD CARDS AT THIS POINT. FOR A SOLID CASE, DETECTIVES WILL HAVE TO FIND WAYNE GULLEY AND CONFRONT HIM. IN DECEMBER 2001, DETECTIVE LARRY ECK AND HIS PARTNER PAY A VISIT TO NOW 60-YEAR-OLD WAYNE GULLEY, THE EX-HUSBAND OF WENDY LEWIS AND THE MAN WHO SHARES RESPONSIBILITY WITH HER FOR SHERRY GIBSON'S MURDER. HELLO. CAN I HELP YOU? HI, DETECTIVE LARRY ECK. CAN I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR EX-WIFE? SURE. COME ON IN. THANK YOU. HAVE A SEAT. CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING, COFFEE? NO, THANK YOU. I'M FINE. WAYNE GULLEY WAS YOUR MODEL CITIZEN, SO TO SPEAK. HE HAD A MASTER'S DEGREE. HE HAD A GOOD-PAYING JOB. HE HAD NEVER EVEN HAD A PARKING TICKET. WAYNE AGREES TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS. THE DETECTIVES GET HIS ENTIRE STORY ON AUDIOTAPE. HIS DEMEANOR WAS VERY HOSPITABLE, VERY FRIENDLY. WE GOT ALONG VERY WELL. MAYBE '75? HE GOES INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT HIS LIFE, REMEMBERS WHERE HE LIVED AND THE CARS THEY OWNED AND THE LIKE. I FINALLY GOT DOWN TO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WENDY. I SAID, "SHE SAID THAT SHE KILLED SOMEBODY, AND YOU WERE WITH HER." I SAID, "WELL, YOU TOOK ME THROUGH SIX WIVES, SIX DIVORCES, EVERY CAR YOU EVER HAD, EVERY PLACE YOU EVER WORKED. I GUESS YOU COULD FORGET IT, BUT SEEMS LIKE TO ME THAT THAT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS." "WELL, IF SHE SAYS SHE DID IT, MAYBE I WAS THERE." AND HE ALSO SAID SOMETHING THAT I THOUGHT WAS REALLY TELLING IN THAT INTERVIEW WAS HE'S LIKE, "NOW, LET'S SAY SHE IS TELLING THE TRUTH. COULD I HAVE BLACKED IT OUT AND NOT REMEMBERED IT?" WHO SAYS THAT? I MEAN, WHO'S GOING TO BLACK OUT AND NOT REMEMBER TORTURING, RAPING, KILLING, SETTING A WOMAN ON FIRE? IN LATE AUGUST 2002, WAYNE GULLEY IS INDICTED FOR MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE. WHEN THE TRIAL BEGINS A YEAR LATER, WENDY LEWIS IS CALLED TO TESTIFY. FOR THE FIRST TIME, SHE STANDS UP TO HER TORMENTOR. IT WAS HER TESTIMONY ALONE, ESSENTIALLY, THAT SEALED THE CASE. HER TESTIMONY WAS SO BELIEVABLE AND SO EMPOWERING IN A SENSE. WAYNE GULLEY MAINTAINS HIS INNOCENCE AND CHOOSES NOT TO TAKE THE STAND IN HIS OWN DEFENSE, BUT THE TAPES OF HIS INTERVIEW WITH LARRY ECK ARE PLAYED FOR THE JURY. WAYNE TALKED HIMSELF INTO PRISON. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S SMARTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. I'VE BEEN MARRIED SIX TIMES. IN THE MOST DAMNING PART OF THE INTERVIEW, DETECTIVE ECK SHOWS WAYNE GULLEY THE COMPOSITE SKETCH OF THE KILLERS. THE DESCRIPTION THAT LINDY ALTON HAD GIVEN POLICE MORE THAN 25 YEARS EARLIER TURNS OUT TO BE A LINCHPIN IN THE CASE. LINDY ALTON KIND OF CAME BACK FROM THE GRAVE. THOSE COMPOSITE SKETCHES WERE UNBELIEVABLE, I MEAN, DOWN TO THE PART OF WAYNE GULLEY'S HAIR. THE SKETCHES LOOK JUST LIKE THEM. YOU FELT LIKE, FINALLY, THIS FAMILY AND THIS COMMUNITY IS GOING TO GET SOME JUSTICE. JURY BELIEVED HER WORD... ALTHOUGH WAYNE DOES NOT TESTIFY, HE DOES AN INTERVIEW, HIS ONLY ONE, WITH LOCAL REPORTER STEFANIE SILVEY. HE MADE THE HAIRS ON THE BACK OF MY NECK STAND UP. IT WAS ALL ABOUT HOW SOMEONE COULD BELIEVE HER OVER HIM, AND HE JUST COULDN'T GET OVER THAT. THE ONLY WITNESS WAS A LONG-AGO EX WHO WAS... HAS A HISTORY OF JUST, I MEAN, ALCOHOLISM. REALLY, IT WAS HER WORD AGAINST MINE, AND HOW THEY COULD HAVE CONVICTED ME, I REALLY DON'T... I MEAN, I'M DEPRESSED ABOUT IT. I DON'T LIKE IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR. WAYNE GULLEY IS A VERY SMART, INTELLIGENT MAN, AND HE KNOWS IT, AND HE USES IT, AND HE CONTROLS PEOPLE. HE'S A MASTER MANIPULATOR, AND HE'S A COLD-BLOODED KILLER. ON AUGUST 19th, 2003, THE JURY FINDS WAYNE GULLEY GUILTY OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. HE IS SENTENCED TO 50 YEARS IN PRISON. WENDY PLEADS GUILTY TO MURDER IN THE SECOND DEGREE AND IS SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS TO HIM, JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF TRASH THAT HE COULD TAKE AND JUST DO WHATEVER HE WANTED TO DO WITH. I DID APOLOGIZE TO THE GIBSONS. I DON'T EXPECT THEM TO, BUT I JUST HOPE THAT THEY CAN FORGIVE ME. YOU'RE TORN IN FEELING SOME SYMPATHY FOR THIS WOMAN AND FEELING SOME OUTRAGE FOR HER, AS WELL. SHE'S NOT BLAMELESS HERE. SHE DID PARTICIPATE, AND SHE PARTICIPATED A LOT, AND IT'S TRAGIC THAT IT TOOK THIS LONG FOR HER TO COME FORWARD. REMEMBER WHO THE TRUE VICTIM WAS, AND THAT WAS LINDY ALTON, WHO NEVER GOT OVER THIS, DIED IN A FIRE A SHORT TIME LATER, AND SHERRY LEE GIBSON.
