 SHE'S STARTING TO UNRAVEL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Narrator: SATISFACTION FOR REBECCA WILL ONLY COME WHEN HER RIVALS PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE. SHE STARTED TALKING ABOUT A MORE PERMANENT RESOLUTION THAN JUST TERRORIZING THE PEOPLE. THEN HE SAID, "I TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO KILL," AND SHE GOES, "THAT'S WHAT I WANT. THAT'S IT." [ GLASS SHATTERS ] ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: THE TINY TEXAS HAMLET OF BRIDGEPORT IS THE KIND OF PLACE WHERE NEWS TRAVELS FAST. IT WOULD PROBABLY BEST BE DESCRIBED

 AS A SLEEPY LITTLE TOWN. SOME MIGHT DESCRIBE IT AS A ONE-HORSE TOWN. D'Avignon: IT'S DEFINITELY A COUNTRY TOWN. EVERYBODY KNOWS EVERYBODY, AND REPUTATION IS IMPORTANT. Narrator: IN 1999, ONE PERSON IN PARTICULAR IS KNOWN FOR LEVERAGING HER HIGH STATUS - - 37-YEAR-OLD REBECCA SIMPSON. Jack: REBECCA SIMPSON RULED THAT TOWN. SHE WAS MARRIED TO ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT ATTORNEYS IN TOWN. D'Avignon: THEY WERE AROUND THE COMMUNITY ALL THE TIME. SHE WAS ALWAYS AROUND THE SCHOOLS. NO RUNNING OFF TO SCHOOL WITHOUT BREAKFAST. NOT ALLOWED. THERE WE GO. Narrator: MARRIED FOR 15 YEARS, REBECCA AND HER HUSBAND HAVE THREE KIDS. Lanier: BY ALL ACCOUNTS, SHE WAS A GOOD MOM. SHE WENT TO THEIR SPORTING EVENTS. SHE WAS SEEN AROUND TOWN. SHE WAS CHURCH-GOING. IT SEEMED LIKE THEY HAD A PRETTY GOOD LIFE. SHE HAD A MONTHLY ALLOWANCE THAT WAS IN UPWARDS OF $5,000 TO $10,000, REPORTEDLY. HER HUSBAND OFTEN REFERRED TO HER AS HIS ROYAL QUEEN. SHE HAD PLENTY OF MONEY TO THROW AROUND, AND SHE DID, AND EVERYONE THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT. YOU GUYS HAVE A GREAT DAY. YOU, TOO. BUT BEHIND THE SCENES, IT WAS A MESS. SHE WANTED THIS EXCITING LIFE THAT I'M SURE BRIDGEPORT, TEXAS, AND THREE KIDS DIDN'T GIVE HER. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: WITH HER KIDS IN SCHOOL AND HER HUSBAND CONSUMED WITH HIS LAW PRACTICE, REBECCA LOOKS FOR A NEW WAY TO FILL HER TIME. THERE'S A HANDFUL OF PLACES THAT PEOPLE GO TO SEE AND BE SEEN, AND THE GYM HAPPENED TO BE ONE OF THEM. PEOPLE WENT THERE TO SOCIALIZE AS WELL AS TO WORK OUT. Narrator: IT'S THERE THAT REBECCA MEETS THE OWNER, 29-YEAR-OLD DANNY WATTS. D'Avignon: DANNY WATTS WAS KIND OF WHAT YOU'D EXPECT FOR A GUY WHO OWNS A GYM, AND REBECCA SIMPSON WAS INSTANTLY INFATUATED. JUST MAKE SURE TO KEEP YOUR ARMS ALL THE WAY DOWN, OKAY? HE WAS A BODYBUILDER. HE WAS HANDSOME, AND HE WAS SINGLE. HE WAS CHARMING, AND THE LADIES LIKED HIM. SO SHE BEGAN TO WORK OUT, AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER, SHE ASKED DANNY TO BECOME HER PERSONAL TRAINER. Narrator: FROM THERE, REBECCA WORKS ON FINDING A REASON FOR DANNY TO VISIT HER AT HOME. Jack: SHE CLAIMED TO HAVE A PLUMBING ISSUE AT HER HOUSE, HAVING TO DO WITH HER HOT TUB, AND HE CAME OUT TO HER MANSION ON THE HILL, OSTENSIBLY TO FIX IT, AND I THINK THE REST BECAME HISTORY SO TO SPEAK. Narrator: A LUST-CHARGED AFFAIR BEGINS, AND SOON THE TWO ARE CALLING EACH OTHER AS MANY AS 10 TIMES A DAY. Jack: THERE WAS A LOT OF CHEMISTRY BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. IT WAS VERY PHYSICAL. DANNY PROVIDED HER A PART OF LIFE THAT HER HUSBAND COULD NEVER PROVIDE HER. Lanier: BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THEY WERE SERIOUS. THEY WENT ON TRIPS TOGETHER. THEY EXCHANGED CARDS IN WHICH THEY EXPRESSED THEIR AFFECTION TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND THEIR DESIRE TO MAYBE ONE DAY BE COMMITTED. Narrator: PARTLY, IT SEEMS, BECAUSE, FOR A YOUNG GUY LIKE DANNY, REBECCA IS THE PERFECT SUGAR MAMA. Lanier: REBECCA SPENT QUITE A BIT OF MONEY ON DANNY. BECAUSE SHE WAS TAKING SO MUCH TIME FROM HIM, SHE WAS OFFERING TO PAY HIS BILLS. D'Avignon: SHE BOUGHT A TANNING BED AT ONE POINT FOR THE GYM. DANNY WATTS WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO NOT ONLY HAVE, I'M SURE, THE AFFECTION OF REBECCA SIMPSON BUT ALSO THE MONETARY SUPPORT OF REBECCA SIMPSON. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] Narrator: AS HER AFFAIR WITH DANNY CONTINUES, REBECCA MAKES NO MOVES TO DIVORCE HER HUSBAND OR GIVE UP THE GRAND LIFESTYLE HE PROVIDES. HELLO? OH, HEY. D'Avignon: REBECCA LIKED EVERYONE THINKING THAT SHE HAD IT ALL, AND HAVING IT ALL MEANT HAVING THE RICH HUSBAND, THE BIG HOUSE, THE CHILDREN, AND SO SHE WANTED TO LIVE THIS EXCITING LIFE - - WHAT SHE CONSIDERED AN EXCITING LIFE WITH DANNY, BUT SHE WANTED THE TOWN TO THINK OF HER AS THE PERFECT PTA MOM, AND TO DO THAT, SHE HAD TO REMAIN MARRIED. Narrator: BUT AROUND TINY BRIDGEPORT, REBECCA'S BAD BEHAVIOR DOESN'T GO UNNOTICED. YOU HEAR PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HOW SHE WOULD BE AROUND THE GYM ALL THE TIME. SHE WAS LIVING THIS AFFAIR BUT LIVING IT OUT LOUD IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY. TO BEGIN WITH, THE GYM WAS TWO DOORS DOWN FROM HER HUSBAND'S LAW OFFICE. YOUR SHOULDERS ARE REALLY COMING ALONG. SHE WAS GOING FROM ONE BUILDING TO THE OTHER BUILDING. D'Avignon: HER HUSBAND WAS A BUSY MAN. I THINK HE PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE WHAT WAS GOING ON, BUT IT WAS RIGHT DOWN THE STREET FROM HIM. Narrator: THE REAL THREAT TO REBECCA'S NEWFOUND HAPPINESS IS NOT HER HUSBAND. IT'S DANNY. REBECCA IS MARRIED, OF COURSE, BUT DANNY'S NOT. WOMEN FLIRTED WITH HIM AT THE GYM. WOMEN WENT UP TO HIM AND TALKED TO HIM. IF SHE WOULD SEE HIM IN THE GYM AND HE WAS SHOWING ANY WOMAN ANY MORE ATTENTION THAN, SAY, ANOTHER WOMAN OR ANOTHER CLIENT, SOMEONE HE WAS TRAINING, SHE WOULD BECOME VERY POSSESSIVE AND VERY JEALOUS. THERE'S NOT TOO MUCH TOO IT, YOU KNOW... DANNY. WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SESSION. THIS IS MY TIME YOU'RE ON. SHE DID NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL, AND SOMETIMES, SHE WOULD ACTUALLY INTERROGATE SOME OF THE WOMEN WHO WOULD STRIKE UP A CONVERSATION WITH DANNY. YOU'RE ON MY TIME. YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW. OKAY. REBECCA EXPECTED HIM TO FOLLOW HER EVERY DEMAND BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ONE IN CONTROL. IF HE DIDN'T DO WHAT SHE SAID, THERE WAS A MONETARY CONSEQUENCE, SO AT SOME POINT, THAT'S GOT TO WEAR ON ANY RELATIONSHIP. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: FOR TWO YEARS, DANNY CARRIES ON THE AFFAIR WITH REBECCA. THEN HE DECIDES IT'S TIME TO BREAK AWAY. HE REALIZED SHE WAS NEVER GOING TO LEAVE HER HUSBAND. THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO HAVE THIS STORYBOOK RELATIONSHIP THAT HE THOUGHT - - THAT HE ENVISIONED. Narrator: DANNY STARTS TO DATE OTHER WOMEN. WE HAVE STORY AFTER STORY OF PEOPLE THAT TRIED TO DATE DANNY WATTS AND GOT THE RECEIVING END OF REBECCA SIMPSON. SHE WOULD STALK THEIR HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT. SHE WOULD COME INTO THE GYM AND THREATEN THEM. SHE WOULD TELL THEM THAT "HE'S NEVER GOING TO YOU. HE'S ALWAYS GOING TO LOVE ME," AND THESE WOMEN ULTIMATELY, HONESTLY, WENT, "YOU KNOW WHAT? DATING DANNY ISN'T WORTH THIS HARASSMENT," AND WOULD LEAVE HIM, AND SO IT WORKED. Jack: WHEN HE BEGAN DATING ANOTHER WOMAN, HE FIRST WARNED THIS OTHER WOMAN, "LOOK, YOU MAY SEE REBECCA COME AROUND. SHE MIGHT TRY TO SCARE YOU OFF." SHE WAS VERY POSSESSIVE OF HIM. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: FINALLY, 3 1/2 YEARS INTO THE AFFAIR, DANNY GETS SERIOUS ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE, 23-YEAR-OLD DIVORCéE SHEMANE BIEDIGER. Jack: SHEMANE WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN. SHE WAS A SINGLE MOM. SHE HAD TWO ADORABLE LITTLE BOYS. AT ONE POINT, SHE HAD DONE SOME MODELING. SHE WAS ALMOST 20 YEARS REBECCA'S JUNIOR. AM I DOING IT RIGHT? OH, YOU'RE DOING GREAT. WHEN SHEMANE CAME INTO THE PICTURE, SHE VERY QUICKLY TOOK A VERY PROMINENT SPOT IN DANNY'S WORLD, AND THEY JUST... HONESTLY, THEIR LIFESTYLES JUST FIT BETTER. RIGHT HERE? Narrator: WITHIN MONTHS, DANNY DECIDES TO PROPOSE TO SHEMANE. Lanier: DANNY AND SHEMANE MET, AND THEY WERE MARRIED JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER, AND THEY QUICKLY BEGAN WORKING AT THE GYM TOGETHER. THEY WERE TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE DAILY. HELLO, BEAUTIFUL. HEY. Narrator: EVEN THEN, DANNY IS UNABLE TO CUT ALL TIES WITH REBECCA. Jack: REBECCA WAS, IN HIS MIND, OUT OF HIS LEAGUE, BUT DANNY DID STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER, AND HE CONTINUED TO SEE REBECCA WHEN HE WAS MARRIED. HE DID HIDE THIS FROM SHEMANE. Narrator: AND JUST AS SHE HAD WITH THE OTHERS, REBECCA IS DETERMINED TO DRIVE SHEMANE OFF. REBECCA MAKES HER RELATIONSHIP WITH DANNY - - THE CONTINUED RELATIONSHIP - - WITH DANNY KNOWN. SHE REALLY RUBS SHEMANE'S FACE IN IT. D'Avignon: REBECCA WOULD TELL HER, "DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE ALL THESE TEXT MESSAGES THAT HE SENDS ME? DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE THESE PHONE CALLS? I'M THE ONE." Narrator: DANNY BEGS HIS WIFE TO IGNORE THE TAUNTS, BUT REBECCA WON'T LEAVE SHEMANE ALONE. SHE CALLED THE GYM HUNDREDS OF TIMES EACH MONTH. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] SHE WAS ACTUALLY CALLING DOZENS OF TIMES TO THE HOME WHERE THIS HUSBAND AND WIFE LIVED TOGETHER. Narrator: REBECCA IS NOT ABOUT TO SHARE DANNY WITH ANYONE, INCLUDING HIS WIFE. SHE DROVE BY THEIR HOUSE. THE NEIGHBORS SAW REBECCA OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOWS IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS. SHE'S OBSESSIVE, AND ANYONE THAT GOT BETWEEN HER AND DANNY WAS IN DANGER. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: 41-YEAR-OLD REBECCA SIMPSON IS A WOMAN USED TO HAVING HER WAY, AND IN 2003, WHEN HER YOUNGER LOVER, DANNY WATTS, GETS MARRIED TO SHEMANE BIEDIGER, SHE BEGINS AN ALL- OR-NOTHING CAMPAIGN TO BREAK THEM APART. SHE WAS INFATUATED WITH THEIR RELATIONSHIP. Jack: WHEN DANNY MARRIED SHEMANE, SHE COULDN'T CONTROL THE SITUATION. THAT PUSHED REBECCA TO A POINT SHE'D NEVER BEEN. SHE HAD EVERYTHING THAT ANY WOMAN WOULD WANT, EXCEPT DANNY WATTS. Narrator: NOW HER FUTURE WITH DANNY ISN'T HER ONLY CONCERN. REBECCA'S HUSBAND IS STARTING TO QUESTION HOW SHE USES HER DISCRETIONARY FUNDS. D'Avignon: HE CERTAINLY DID NOTICE THAT MONEY FLOWED FROM HIS BANK ACCOUNT INTO DANNY'S, AND SO HE MOVED HER ALLOWANCE DOWN BECAUSE HE REALIZED THE MONEY WAS GOING INTO THAT GYM. Narrator: REBECCA IS NOT DETERRED. SHEMANE! NOT WANTING TO CAUSE A SCENE, SHEMANE DOES NOT ENGAGE REBECCA. CAN YOU HEAR ME? DANNY'S MINE! STILL, THE TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO WOMEN BECOMES THE TALK OF THE TOWN. Jack: IT WAS AN ONGOING FEUD. ANYTIME THEY CAME INTO CONTACT WITH ONE ANOTHER, ONE OF THEM WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING OR DO SOMETHING OR POTENTIALLY FLIP THE OTHER ONE OFF OR MAKE A DEROGATORY COMMENT. DANNY'S MINE. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: REBECCA EVEN PAYS A VISIT TO SHEMANE'S TWO BOYS FROM HER PREVIOUS MARRIAGE. REBECCA SIMPSON WAS VERY CONNIVING. SHE WOULD GO TO THE SCHOOL AND BRING SHEMANE'S SONS SNACKS TO TRY AND WIN THEM OVER, AND SHE WAS SO WELL KNOWN AT THE SCHOOL, THAT THEY WOULD LET HER COME IN AND GIVE THESE SNACKS TO THESE BOYS. PEOPLE HAVE ALWAYS JUST TAKEN HER AT HER WORD BECAUSE SHE'S AGGRESSIVE IF THEY DON'T. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: MEANWHILE, REBECCA BOLDLY STOPS HIDING HER AFFAIR FROM HER 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER. SHE TREATED HER DAUGHTER LIKE THEY WERE BEST FRIENDS, AND SHE WOULD BRING DANNY AROUND HER DAUGHTER. Jack: HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN TO DINNER WITH THEM. SHE'D BEEN TO DANNY'S APARTMENT WITH REBECCA. SHE HAD INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. Narrator: REBECCA'S DAUGHTER AND DANNY GROW EVEN CLOSER AS HE STARTS TRAINING HER AT HIS GYM. AND THEN HER DAUGHTER, WHO WAS GETTING OLDER AND PRETTIER, PROBABLY BECAME YET ANOTHER FIGURE OF COMPETITION FOR HER WHEN IT CAME TO DANNY. IT'S NOT A NORMAL MOTHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: IN THE WINTER AND SPRING OF 2004, DANNY MAKES SEVERAL ATTEMPTS TO PULL AWAY FROM REBECCA BUT FAILS. I THINK IT'S A CHEMISTRY THAT THE TWO OF THEM HAD THAT NEITHER HAD EVER HAD WITH ANYONE ELSE. I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE. Narrator: FINALLY, IN JUNE, MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AFTER THEIR AFFAIR BEGAN, DANNY DECIDES TO BREAK IT OFF FOR GOOD. REBECCA REFUSES TO LET GO. DANNY! GET BACK HERE! SHE CALLS DANNY REPEATEDLY AND EXPLODES WITH A SURPRISING CLAIM. HER DAUGHTER WAS SAYING THAT DANNY WAS MAKING LEWD SUGGESTIONS, WAS CALLING HER, MAKING INAPPROPRIATE REMARKS. SHE WAS ACCUSING DANNY OF BEING A PEDOPHILE. D'Avignon: ALL OF THESE THINGS WERE NOT TRUE, AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, SHE'S THE ONE THAT HAD ENCOURAGED A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN DANNY AND HER DAUGHTER. Narrator: AND DANNY ISN'T THE ONLY ONE BEING VICTIMIZED BY REBECCA'S OUTRAGEOUS BEHAVIOR. [ GLASS SHATTERS ] D'Avignon: SHE'S A 42-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, AND SHE'S GETTING IN MULTIPLE ALTERCATIONS. SHE HAD GOTTEN IN A FIGHT AT HER SON'S COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAME OUT IN LUBBOCK, TEXAS, GOTTEN IN A FIGHT RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER WHOLE FAMILY. SHE HAD GOTTEN IN A FIGHT WITH A WOMAN IN A BATHROOM AT A RESTAURANT IN DALLAS, A NICE RESTAURANT IN DALLAS. SHE'S STARTING TO UNRAVEL. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: IN OCTOBER, A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE BREAKUP, REBECCA TAKES DIRECT AIM AT DANNY'S WIFE. D'Avignon: SHEMANE WAS IN THE BACK ACTUALLY MAKING A SNACK FOR HER CHILDREN, AND REBECCA CAME INTO THE GYM. Lanier: HER PURPOSE IS TO SHOW SHEMANE THE NUMBER OF TIMES THAT DANNY HAD BEEN CALLING HER. Jack: NEXT THING SHEMANE KNOWS, SHE LOOKS UP AND REBECCA IS STANDING IN THE KITCHEN WITH HER, FLAUNTING HER CELLPHONE IN SHEMANE'S FACE. NO, YOU NEED TO LEAVE. AND REBECCA WARNS HER, "Y'ALL WON'T LAST." - DANNY AND I ARE TOGETHER. - NO, YOU ARE NOT. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR A LONG TIME. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE EVEN TALKING ABOUT. AND REBECCA SAYS, "HE'S STILL CALLING ME. LOOK AT ALL THESE CALLS." - I DON'T CARE. I DON'T CARE. - GET OUT. BUT THIS WAS NOT DANNY CALLING HER, IT WAS HER CALLING DANNY, ABOUT 200 TIMES THAT MONTH. - I'M CALLING THE POLICE. - NO. GO AHEAD. - NO. - YOU NEED TO MOVE. NO, BUT DANNY AND I ARE TOGETHER. D'Avignon: AND SHEMANE SAYS, "IT'S TIME TO GO," LIKE, "WE'RE NOT DOING THIS." NO, YOU NEED TO LEAVE. BECAUSE HE AND I ARE TOGETHER. SHEMANE NATURALLY BECOMES VERY UPSET. HE'S MINE. - YOU NEED TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW. - HE AND I ARE... Jack: SHE'S REALLY ASTONISHED THAT REBECCA HAS TAKEN IT TO THIS LEVEL, AND SHEMANE, SHE TAKES HER BY THE ARM AND ESCORTS HER OUT OF THE GYM. SHEMANE IS TRYING TO PUSH HER OUT OF THE GYM. SHE'S TRYING TO PUSH BACK IN. Jack: AND WHEN REBECCA FINALLY LEAVES THE GYM... - JUST GET OUT! - HE WANTS ME! NO, HE DOESN'T! STOP! GO. Jack: AND SHE'S TRYING TO CALL 911. WELL, ABOUT THAT TIME, REBECCA TURNS AROUND AND STARTS TRYING TO SHOVE THE DOOR IN WHILE SHEMANE'S ON THE OTHER SIDE, TRYING TO KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED. GET OUT OF HERE! GET OUT! I THINK REBECCA USED SOME EXPLETIVES. I THINK SHE SAID THINGS LIKE, "Y'ALL WILL NEVER MAKE IT. I'LL TEAR YOU APART," AND "THE FIGHT IS ON." WHAT ARE YOU DOING? HE'S... ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: STUNG BY THE REJECTION OF HER LOVER, DANNY WATTS, REBECCA SIMPSON CONFRONTS HIS WIFE, SHEMANE. - GET OUT OF MY BUSINESS. - NO. - I'M CALLING 911. - HE AND I ARE TOGETHER. HE LOVES ME. YOU NEED TO LEAVE... YOU NEED TO ACCEPT THAT. ...RIGHT NOW. THIS WAS THE PERFECT STORM IN HER MIND. - DANNY IS MINE! - I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE. - SHE WAS UNPREDICTABLE. - GET OUT! WHEN SHE LOST CONTROL, ALL BETS WERE OFF. Narrator: REBECCA'S UNWILLINGNESS TO BACK OFF LEAVES SHEMANE WITH ONLY ONE OPTION. SHEMANE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE, TRYING TO KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED, BUT SHE'S ALSO TRYING TO REACH FOR THE PHONE... I'M CALLING THE POLICE. WE'RE TOGETHER. ...TO CALL THE POLICE. SHEMANE HAD GOT ON THE PHONE WITH THE POLICE AND TRIED TO GET ASSISTANCE THERE AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. STOP! Jack: MEANWHILE, REBECCA IS SUCCESSFUL IN PUSHING THE DOOR OPEN, AND SHE'S ABLE TO LAND SOME BLOWS ON SHEMANE. GET OUT! HE AND I ARE TOGETHER! GET OUT! SHEMANE IS TRYING TO KICK AT REBECCA TO GET HER OFF OF HER. SHE'S GONE. IT'S OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? AND THAT WAS WHEN REBECCA HAD TAKEN THE PHONE AND THREW IT OUT IN THE STREET. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: BY THE TIME POLICE ARRIVE, REBECCA IS LONG GONE. SHE'S CRAZY. SHE'S SO CRAZY. Lanier: AT THAT POINT, SHEMANE HAD ENOUGH. POLICE REPORTS ARE MADE AND NOW THE AUTHORITIES ARE INVOLVED. Narrator: WHAT REBECCA DOES NEXT TAKES THE FEUD TO A NEW LEVEL. REBECCA SIMPSON IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE AREA, AND SHE DROVE TO HER FRIEND'S HOUSE AND CALLED CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES, PRETENDING TO BE ONE OF SHEMANE'S VERY BEST FRIENDS, REPORTING THAT SHEMANE WAS AN UNFIT MOTHER, THAT SHE WAS A DRUNK, ALL OF THESE THINGS, TO START TRYING TO LAY BLAME ON SHEMANE. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, REBECCA IS CALLED TO THE POLICE STATION TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FIGHT. REBECCA TELLS THE POLICE THAT SHE WAS ACTING IN SELF-DEFENSE, AND SHE, IN TURN, ATTEMPTS TO FILE A REPORT ON SHEMANE. SHE'S CRAZY. SHE ATTACKED ME. REBECCA TRIED TO PAINT A STORY THAT SHE WAS THE ONE BEING HARASSED, THAT SHE WAS THE ONE ASSAULTED. SHE DID ADMIT TO TAKING THE TELEPHONE AND THROWING IT INTO THE STREET, BUT IT WAS ALWAYS... HER RESPONSE WAS ALWAYS TO BLAME SOMEONE ELSE. SHE CLAIMS THAT THE FIGHT BEGINS IN THE STREET WITH SHEMANE APPROACHING HER AND PROVOKING THE ALTERCATION. SHE CONVENIENTLY LEAVES OFF THE PART THAT SHE ENTERED THE GYM FIRST. POLICE ASK HER IF SHE WAS WEARING ANY JEWELRY AT THE TIME, AND SHE SOMEWHAT CHUCKLES AND BRAGS THAT IF SHE HAD BEEN WEARING HER ENGAGEMENT RING, SHE REALLY WOULD HAVE HURT SHEMANE, AND SHE GOES ON TO SAY, NOT ONLY WAS THIS SELF-DEFENSE, BUT IF SHE HAD HAD A GUN, SHE WOULD HAVE HAD THE RIGHT TO USE IT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WERE TOLD. WHATEVER YOU WERE TOLD... REBECCA SPENT THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS COMING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE BRIDGEPORT POLICE DEPARTMENT, REDOING HER STATEMENT TO POLICE. SHE ACTUALLY MADE 11 CORRECTIONS BEFORE IT WAS ALL SAID AND DONE BECAUSE SHE WANTED HER STORY TO BE PERFECT. Narrator: HER PERFECT STORY DOES LITTLE TO SWAY THE POLICE. YEAH. WE DID HAVE A STATEMENT FROM AN EYEWITNESS THAT CONFIRMED THE STORY OF SHEMANE. AH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? Narrator: ASIDE FROM TALKING WITH POLICE, DANNY AND SHEMANE WATTS KEEP QUIET, HOPING THAT THE INCIDENT BRINGS THEIR DEALINGS WITH REBECCA TO AN END. YOU CAN SENSE THAT SHEMANE DOESN'T REALLY WANT THIS TO BECOME PUBLIC. SHE JUST WANTS IT TO STOP. SHE JUST WANTS TO HAVE HER RELATIONSHIP WITH DANNY AND HER MARRIAGE PROTECTED. Narrator: BUT THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST SCANDALOUS THING GOING ON IN TINY BRIDGEPORT, TEXAS. Lanier: IT WAS WHAT EVERYONE WAS TALKING ABOUT. IT WAS A SALACIOUS STORY. IT WAS A STORY THAT YOU REALLY COULDN'T GET ENOUGH OF. YOU WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, HOW WAS THIS GOING TO UNFOLD. THIS IS THE KIND OF TOWN WHERE A CAT FIGHT ON PUBLIC STREETS IS GOING TO BE THE FRONT PAGE NEWS. Jack: THEY REALLY MADE SHEMANE OUT TO BE SYMPATHETIC ONE, AND THEY MADE REBECCA LOOK UNSTABLE. THIS SENDS HER OVER THE EDGE. I THINK THAT'S WHY SHE BECAME SO AGITATED AND SO ANGRY OVER THIS WHOLE INCIDENT, WAS BECAUSE HER REPUTATION WAS ON THE LINE. IT DEFINITELY GAVE FOLKS SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. IT DID PAINT A NEGATIVE PICTURE OF REBECCA. THAT WAS DAMAGING TO HER REPUTATION. IT WAS DAMAGING TO HER HUSBAND'S STATUS. IT CUT HER TO THE CORE. Narrator: DESPITE THE ARTICLE, REBECCA'S HUSBAND STANDS BY HER, THOUGH HE URGES HER TO LAY LOW, BUT THAT'S NOT REBECCA. AND NOW, ALL OF A SUDDEN, REBECCA SIMPSON HAS TO HAVE A REASON WHY THIS FIGHT OCCURRED BECAUSE IF THE REASON IS THAT THE GOSSIP IS TRUE, THAT SHE AND DANNY HAVE BEEN AN ITEM ALL ALONG, THAT'S GOING TO RUIN HER PERFECT IMAGE. REBECCA HAS TO PLAY THE VICTIM. SHE SAYS, "OH, THIS FIGHT ISN'T ABOUT DANNY. THIS FIGHT IS ABOUT THAT THEY'VE BEEN HARASSING ME." SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE WAS IN GRAVE FEAR, HER CHILDREN WERE IN GRAVE DANGER. SHE SAYS THAT, "DANNY WAS PURSUING MY DAUGHTER, AND I WAS TRYING TO KEEP THIS PEDOPHILE AWAY FROM MY CHILD." AND SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO STOP THAT, AND SHE HAD NOWHERE TO TURN. AND AS THE WEEK IS GOING ON AND SHE'S UNRAVELING AND SHE'S UNRAVELING. ♪♪♪♪ HOW YOU DOING? TEN ON ONE. Narrator: FIVE DAYS AFTER THE FIGHT, REBECCA IS PLOTTING HER REVENGE WHEN SHE RUNS INTO AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE, OWEN HARGROVE. REBECCA, RIGHT? YEAH. GOOD. HOW ARE YOU DOING? GOOD. SHE LOOKED AT ME, AND SHE SAID, "HEY, YOU," AND I DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HER. IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE SAME REBECCA SIMPSON THAT I HAD KNOWN AND CERTAINLY WASN'T BEHAVING LIKE THE SAME REBECCA SIMPSON THAT I HAD KNOWN EITHER. THIS WOMAN... Narrator: OWEN IS KNOWN AROUND TOWN AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN PRIVATE SECURITY. AT THAT TIME, TYPICALLY, HIS UNIFORM WAS CAMO OR HE WOULD DRESS IN BLACK, AND HE TYPICALLY HAD GUNS AND ALL SORTS OF SECURITY PARAPHERNALIA IN HIS CAR. - YEAH. HOW YOU BEEN? - GOOD. Jack: AND THEY BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT HIS EMPLOYMENT AND THAT HE'S INVOLVED IN TEACHING PEOPLE INTERNATIONAL SECURITY. Lanier: AND REBECCA STARTS TALKING TO HIM ABOUT THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE'S HAVING WITH SHEMANE AND THE PROBLEMS THAT SHE WAS HAVING WITH DANNY. IT JUST SO HAPPENS I MIGHT NEED YOUR SERVICES. REALLY? Hargrove: SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD A THREAT IN HER LIFE AND THAT SHE NEEDED IT TO BE DEALT WITH BECAUSE IT CONCERNED NOT ONLY HER BUT HER CHILDREN AS WELL, AND SHE WAS GETTING REALLY SCARED. SO I WAS AUTOMATICALLY THINKING THAT, "OKAY, THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. MAYBE SHE'S GOT A STALKER, SOMETHING LIKE THAT." I THINK I CAN HELP YOU OUT HERE. OH, GREAT. GREAT. I'M SO GLAD I RAN INTO YOU. - LET ME GIVE YOU MY NUMBER. Narrator: NEEDING TO LEAVE, OWEN GIVES REBECCA HIS PHONE NUMBER. AND I WAS ACTUALLY SURPRISED WHEN SHE DID CALL ME, AND IT WAS WITHIN 24 HOURS WHEN SHE CALLED ME. Lanier: AND THEY START HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP HER WITH HER ISSUES. Hargrove: I HAD TOLD HER, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE WANTING MARTIAL ART LESSONS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, OF COURSE WE CAN ARRANGE IT. SHE SAID, "I NEED SOMETHING ELSE. I NEED A FINAL SOLUTION." IT WASN'T JUST A MATTER OF "TEACH ME DEFENSIVE MOVES." SHE SEEMED TO HAVE MORE OF AN OFFENSIVE NATURE IN MIND. NOW IT'S GOING AND ROTATING TOWARD TERRORIZING PEOPLE, SABOTAGING THEIR CAR. SHE WANTED THEM VERY SCARED WHERE THEY KNOW THAT THEY SCREWED UP. THEN HE SAID, "I DON'T TEACH PEOPLE SELF-DEFENSE. I TEACH PEOPLE HOW TO KILL," AND SHE GOES, "THAT'S WHAT I WANT. THAT'S IT." ♪♪♪♪ NO, I DON'T. I HAVE A MEMBERSHIP. I'M GOING TO CALL... I HAVE A MEMBERSHIP HERE. Narrator: WHEN A FIGHT WITH SHEMANE WATTS LANDS BRIDGEPORT, TEXAS, SOCIALITE REBECCA SIMPSON ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LOCAL PAPER, SHE WANTS REVENGE. SHE FEELS AS THOUGH SHEMANE HAS TRASHED HER FAMILY, HAS RUINED HER GOOD NAME, AND THAT SHE NEEDS TO PUT A STOP TO IT. Narrator: AND IN HER OLD ACQUAINTANCE, OWEN HARGROVE, REBECCA THINKS SHE'S FOUND SOMEONE TO HELP. IT'S BEEN A WHILE. Hargrove: I DID AGREE TO MEET HER IN PERSON AND TO KEEP PRYING EYES OFF OF OUR HAVING A CONVERSATION, WE ACTUALLY DROVE TO A PARKING LOT 40 MILES AWAY. Jack: OWEN IS A LITTLE SHOCKED. THIS IS SOMEONE HE'S KNOWN FOR YEARS. I DON'T THINK HE REALLY THOUGHT SHE WAS SERIOUS AT FIRST. SHEMANE WATTS IS MAKING MY LIFE A LIVING HELL. Narrator: REBECCA TELLS OWEN SHE WANTS TO TARGET NOT JUST SHEMANE WATTS BUT DANNY WATTS, TOO. Hargrove: SHE DID NOT COME OUT DIRECTLY AND SAY, "I WANT A HIT MAN," BUT SHE WENT THROUGH THE COURSE OF VARIOUS LEVELS OF TERRORIZING, MENTIONING SUICIDES AND HOW TO MAKE IT LOOK REAL, STAGING DRUG DEALS GONE BAD, AND ULTIMATELY DEATH FOR PEOPLE. I'VE SEEN LOTS OF WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST LOVES, AND I'VE SEEN LOTS OF BAD RELATIONSHIPS. SHE'S THE ONE AND ONLY WOMAN I'VE EVER SEEN RESORT TO THESE KINDS OF MEASURES. I TOLD HER, YOU KNOW, "I JUST CAN'T DO IT," BUT I TOLD HER I HAD A FRIEND, AND HE OWED ME A BIG FAVOR. Narrator: SIX DAYS LATER, OWEN AND REBECCA MEET FOR A THIRD TIME. D'Avignon: WHEN REBECCA ARRIVES AT THE PARKING LOT, SHE COMES TO THE CAR, AND THERE'S A BIG GUY IN THE CAR, AND OWEN INTRODUCES HER. REBECCA IS CLEARLY VERY INTRIGUED BY THE COVERTNESS, THE DANGER OF ALL OF THIS, AND REBECCA THINKS SHE'S FOUND HER SOLUTION. Hargrove: HE'S SCARY, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS WANTING. SHE EVEN SAID THE FIRST THING ABOUT HIM WAS, "WOW, HE'S SCARY." HE HURRIED US INTO HIS PICKUP BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT US TO BE SEEN OUT THERE TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND DISCUSSING THIS OUT IN THE OPEN, AND I LET THEM TALK, AND I RETREATED BACK TO MY CAR. REBECCA BEGINS THE CONVERSATION AND TELLS HIM THAT THIS WOMAN HAS BEEN HARASSING HER AND HER FAMILY, AND SHE JUST CAN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE. SHE BROUGHT UP THE NEWSPAPER ARTICLE. SHE WAS VERY FRUSTRATED AND AGITATED THAT THIS WHOLE SITUATION HAS BLOWN UP TO WHAT IT WAS. IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR HER TO ORDER A HIT ON SHEMANE WATTS. SHE WANTS IT DONE IN A PARTICULAR WAY. REBECCA THOUGHT, "ALL RIGHT. IF WE MAKE THIS LOOK LIKE A SUICIDE, NO ONE IS GOING TO BE THE WISER." NOW YOU'VE GOT A MOTHER WHOSE SONS ARE GOING TO BELIEVE THAT SHE KILLED HERSELF TO GET AWAY FROM THEM. IT'S A PRETTY HORRIFIC THING TO DO TO A FAMILY. Narrator: REBECCA HAS A DETAILED PLAN FOR HER EX-LOVER, DANNY, TOO. THIS WAS THE CULMINATION OF HER ANIMOSITY AND HER ANGER AT DANNY FOR MARRYING SOMEONE ELSE, FOR NOT CONTINUING THE LIFE THAT THEY HAD TOGETHER. I THINK DANNY WAS A POSSESSION. DANNY WAS A PIECE OF PROPERTY TO REBECCA. SHE WANTS TO HUMILIATE HIM AND EMBARRASS HIM AND, FRANKLY, PUT HIM IN HIS PLACE. I THINK SHE WANTED TO TAKE EVERYTHING THAT HE HAD. Narrator: REBECCA EVEN KNOWS THE DATE SHE WANTS THE ATTACK TO OCCUR. SHE HAD PLANNED THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HAVE SURGERY AND THAT SHE WAS INCAPABLE OF HURTING SOMEONE. SHE WOULD BE LAID UP AT HOME ON MEDICATION AND SO FORTH, SO SHE WOULD NOT BE LISTED AS A SUSPECT. Hargrove: SHE SAID, "YOU KNOW, HE'S THE REAL THING, AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO PISS THAT MAN OFF." SHE SEEMED ECSTATIC ABOUT IT. IT WAS LIKE I GAVE HER HER BIRTHDAY PRESENT, CHRISTMAS PRESENT ALL WRAPPED UP IN ONE PACKAGE. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: TWO DAYS LATER, REBECCA ARRIVES WITH THE FIRST PAYMENT. Stanford: SHE WAS EXTREMELY NERVOUS. SHE WAS WORRIED THAT HE WOULD THINK HE WAS BEING SET UP. SHE REPEATEDLY SAID THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CAMERA. Narrator: REBECCA IS NOT NERVOUS ENOUGH TO CALL OFF THE MURDER. AT ONE POINT, HE SAYS TO HER, IT'S A PRETTY SLOW AND PAINFUL WAY TO DIE, TO SLIT YOUR WRISTS. HE EVEN ASKED HER TO GO HOME AND SLEEP ON IT. SHE WAS COLD. SHE WAS UNFEELING. SHE WAS MATTER-OF-FACT. SHE HAD GIVEN THIS QUITE A BIT OF THOUGHT. SHE'S DECIDED THIS IS HER NEW TECHNIQUE FOR DEALING WITH THINGS IN HER LIFE. $2,000, SHE THINKS IS A PRETTY INCONSEQUENTIAL SUM. IN COMPARING A COST OF SOMEONE'S LIFE WITH A PURSE, THAT JUST SHOWED US THAT SHE WAS OFF CENTER. Narrator: THE MONEY IS PAID. THE PLAN IS SET IN MOTION. REBECCA WAS ON A TRAIN THAT WASN'T GOING TO BE STOPPED. SHE WANTED IT EXECUTED ON HER TERMS, AND SHE WANTED PEOPLE TO PAY FOR HER EMBARRASSMENT. Narrator: FOR REBECCA, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT TURNS OUT TO BE FAR MORE DEVASTATING. SHE HAD NO CLUE WHATSOEVER. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: IN OCTOBER 2004, REBECCA SIMPSON AGREES TO PAY $3,000 TO HAVE HER EX-LOVER, DANNY WATTS, BEATEN UP AND FRAMED AS A DRUG DEALER. SHE ALSO WANTS IT TO LOOK LIKE DANNY'S WIFE, SHEMANE, COMMITTED SUICIDE. SHE HAS NO IDEA THAT THE MAN OWEN HARGROVE INTRODUCED HER TO IS NOT A HIT MAN. I INTRODUCED HER TO AN UNDERCOVER OFFICER WITH THE TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. Narrator: BEFORE AGREEING TO INTRODUCE REBECCA TO A HIT MAN, OWEN DECIDES TO TELL POLICE WHAT SHE WANTS DONE. Hargrove: IT WAS A RISK FOR ME, KNOWING HER POWER IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THE TOWN, AND I WAS NERVOUS EVEN GOING IN THERE SAYING ANYTHING AGAINST HER. SO SHE WOULDN'T SEE MY CAR, JUST TO BE CAREFUL, I PARKED THREE BLOCKS AWAY ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET, HIKED THROUGH THE WOODS, RAN ACROSS THE ROAD TO GET TO THE POLICE STATION. Stanford: AT THAT POINT, HONESTLY, I DIDN'T BELIEVE HIM, BUT THE MORE I TALKED TO HIM, AND THE MORE I SAID, YOU KNOW, "THIS IS A SERIOUS ALLEGATION. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THIS IN WRITING," AND HE DIDN'T HESITATE, I KNEW THAT HE WAS SERIOUS. Narrator: ONCE MONEY CHANGES HANDS AND THE HIT IS CONFIRMED, POLICE MOVE TO ARREST REBECCA. WE BELIEVE THAT IF WE DID NOT ACT, THAT SHE WOULD BE UNSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF SHEMANE NOT BEING HURT OR KILLED. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: A FEW DAYS AFTER THE MEETING, REBECCA IS IN HER CAR WITH A FRIEND. THEY'RE ON THE WAY TO PICK UP HER FRIEND'S CHILD FROM SCHOOL WHEN SHE'S APPROACHED BY THE POLICE. REBECCA SIMPSON? COULD YOU PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE CAR? ♪♪♪♪ AND YOU COULD SEE THE LIFE JUST DROP OUT OF HER. SHE WAS SHOCKED, BUT SHE KNEW SHE WAS CAUGHT. D'Avignon: IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT REBECCA SIMPSON DID NOT SEE THIS COMING. SHE IS VERY UPSET. HOW COULD REBECCA SIMPSON GO TO JAIL? THAT'S NEVER IN HER PLAN, AND BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONE WITH THE PLAN, YOU CAN IMAGINE THIS ARREST SENT HER INTO A TAILSPIN. Narrator: AND FOR REBECCA, THERE'S MORE TO COME. AFTER THE ARREST, HER HUSBAND SAYS, "THAT'S IT." I MEAN, HE... WHATEVER HE WAS TRYING TO NOT KNOW, THERE'S NO NOT KNOWING IT ANYMORE. Lanier: ALTHOUGH HER HUSBAND HAD STOOD BY HER SIDE THROUGH OTHER INCIDENTS, SHORTLY AFTER SHE GOT ARRESTED FOR SOLICITATION OF CAPITAL MURDER, HE FILED FOR A DIVORCE. Narrator: THREE WEEKS LATER, REBECCA IS RELEASED ON A $100,000 BOND AND RESUMES LIVING THE LIFE SHE'S GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO. D'Avignon: SHE COULDN'T STOP BEING REBECCA SIMPSON. SHE FINALIZES HER DIVORCE WITH HER HUSBAND AND GETS A BIG CHUNK OF CHANGE BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR A LONG TIME, AND TEXAS IS A COMMUNITY PROPERTY STATE. SO SHE, OF COURSE, IMMEDIATELY JUMPS INTO ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP. SHE HAD PURCHASED AN $85,000 MERCEDES IN THE WEEKS BEFORE TRIAL. SHE WAS PLANNING A WEDDING IN THE CARIBBEAN IN THE WEEKS BEFORE TRIAL, AND SHE AND HER FIANCé HAD PURCHASED A NEW HOME IN THE TIME LEADING UP TO THE TRIAL. THESE ARE NOT THE ACTIONS OF SOMEONE WHO BELIEVED THEY WERE GOING TO BE CONVICTED OR WOULD EVER ENTERTAIN GOING TO PRISON. Narrator: 19 MONTHS AFTER HER ARREST, REBECCA'S TRIAL BEGINS. HER EX-LOVER, DANNY WATTS, IS CALLED TO TESTIFY AGAINST HER. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY EASY FOR HIM, WHEN I SAID, "YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER," TO SAY, "NO, I DON'T," AND HE COULDN'T BRING HIMSELF TO SAY IT. DANNY REALLY NEVER WANTED TO BELIEVE THAT REBECCA SIMPSON WAS CAPABLE OF ORDERING THIS HIT BECAUSE HE DID STILL HAVE FEELINGS FOR HER. I THINK IT WAS MORE OF HIS HEARTBREAK. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: THE TRIAL ALSO MARKS THE END OF DANNY'S MARRIAGE TO SHEMANE. Jack: SHEMANE WAS THE SINGLE MOM WHO MARRIES DANNY WATTS, WHO LOVES DANNY, WHO REALLY THINKS THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DANNY AND REBECCA WAS OVER, AND IN THE END, THERE WAS A VERY REAL FEAR, WHEN SHE TESTIFIED, THAT REBECCA MIGHT WALK ON THESE CHARGES, THAT REBECCA STILL, IN MANY WAYS, HAD THE ABILITY TO ORDER ANOTHER HIT. ONLY THIS TIME, SHE WOULD HAVE LEARNED FROM HER MISTAKES. Narrator: THE TRIAL'S MOST DRAMATIC MOMENT COMES WHEN REBECCA HERSELF TAKES THE STAND. REBECCA BELIEVES SHE COULD TALK HER WAY OUT OF IT, AS SHE HAD DONE SO MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, AND ALTHOUGH IT'S A RISKY MOVE TO TAKE THE STAND, SHE DID IN FACT DO THAT. HER DEFENSE WAS THAT OWEN, HE CAME UP WITH THE PLOT. IT WAS HIS IDEA, AND THAT SHE HAD TO GO ALONG WITH IT BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH SHE WANTED TO BACK OUT, THAT IF SHE DID, IT WOULD ANGER THE HIT MAN AND HER AND HER FAMILY WOULD BECOME HIS TARGET. SHE FELT THREATENED. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: REBECCA'S DEFENSE FALLS APART WHEN PROSECUTORS PLAY THE TAPES FOR THE JURY. AT ONE POINT IN THE CONVERSATION WITH THE UNDERCOVER OFFICER, SHE ACTUALLY TELLS HIM, "I CAN LIE UNDER OATH. I'LL LIE ON THE STAND." OKAY. Jack: WE HAD THE COLD, HARD PROOF. THE TAPES WERE VERY CLEAR, AND THE TAPES WERE DAMNING. YOU REALLY SEE THE HEART OF WHO REBECCA SIMPSON IS. Narrator: AT THE END OF THE 10-DAY TRIAL, JURORS NEED LESS THAN HALF A DAY TO DELIVER THEIR VERDICT. THEY FOUND HER GUILTY OF SOLICITATION OF CAPITAL MURDER. Narrator: REBECCA IS SENTENCED TO 5 YEARS IN PRISON AND A $10,000 FINE. ♪♪♪♪ DETERMINED TO SPICE UP HER LIFE, REBECCA SIMPSON CHOSE AN AFFAIR OVER DIVORCE, AND WHEN HER BEHAVIOR BECAME FODDER FOR PUBLIC GOSSIP, SHE CHOSE MURDER. THE RELATIONSHIP OR ALLEGED RELATIONSHIP WITH DANNY, I'M SURE THAT PLAYED A HUGE PART, BUT I BELIEVE, MORE IMPORTANTLY, REBECCA WAS A VERY VAIN PERSON. SHE WAS VERY EMBARRASSED BY THIS INCIDENT, AND I BELIEVE THAT SHE WANTED TO SEEK PAYMENT FOR WHAT THIS SITUATION HAS COST HER. Jack: SHEMANE WATTS HAD THE AUDACITY TO PUBLICLY TARNISH HER PROMINENT POSITION IN BRIDGEPORT SOCIETY. IT'S NOT A MOTIVE LIKE YOU AND I WOULD HAVE TO KILL SOMEONE, BUT THAT'S THE WAY SHE FUNCTIONED. THAT'S WHO REBECCA SIMPSON WAS. AND I'LL SAY THIS - - SHE SPENT EVERY DAY OF 5 YEARS IN PRISON. D'Avignon: AND PRISON IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE NEEDED. ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪
