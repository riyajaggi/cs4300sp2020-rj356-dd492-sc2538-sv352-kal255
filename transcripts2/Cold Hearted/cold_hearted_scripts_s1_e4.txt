 I DON'T THINK WE HAD ANY IDEA OF HOW MANY TWISTS AND TURNS THAT THE CASE WOULD ULTIMATELY TAKE. IT JUST SENT A CHILL DOWN MY SPINE. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: NOT FAR FROM THE NORFOLK NAVAL BASE, NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA IS STEEPED WITH MILITARY TRADITION. IT'S ALSO HOME TO MANY YOUNG SAILORS LIKE 20-YEAR-OLD CORY ALLEN VOSS. FIFTY. FIFTY-ONE. Dustin: IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE NAVY, CORY WOULD'VE SPENT SOME TIME IN JAIL AND PROBABLY WOULD'VE ENDED UP BECOMING MUCH MORE OF A DELINQUENT AFTERWARDS. HIS LIFE DID CHANGE. Narrator: A MISCHIEVOUS KID, CORY GREW UP IN RURAL ILLINOIS,

 WHERE HE FELL IN WITH A ROUGH CROWD. HE WAS KIND OF IMPULSIVE, A LITTLE BIT OF A BRAT, TROUBLE-MAKER, BUT SMARTER THAN HE SEEMED, AND HAD A GOOD SENSE OF HUMOR. Dujardin: HE DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND GOT A G. E. D. AND THEN AFTER HE DID THAT, I GUESS HE WENT FROM JOB TO JOB. HE WAS SPINNING HIS WHEELS, DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO DO. HIS MOTHER ACTUALLY SUGGESTED THE NAVY. SHE SAID HE TOOK TO IT LIKE A DUCK TO WATER AND JUST DID REALLY WELL. Rilee: CORY SEEMED TO CHANGE HIS LIFE. HE WAS VERY WELL LIKED AND DID VERY WELL IN HIS CAREER IN THE MILITARY. HE GOT THE DISCIPLINE THAT I HOPED HE WOULD. HE HAD A LOT MORE SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND SELF-ASSUREDNESS AFTER HE HAD GONE THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS. Narrator: STILL, IN THE FALL OF 1997, 20-YEAR-OLD CORY HAS SOME WILD OATS LEFT TO SOW. Dustin: I KNEW HE HAD HAD SOME GIRLS HERE AND THERE IN VARIOUS PORTS. I THINK I MIGHT GO OVER THERE. Girl: YEAH! I DON'T THINK HE WAS SETTING DOWN WITH ANYBODY, AND NOBODY REALLY EXPECTED HIM TO. HE HAD THAT SORT OF BACHELOR VIBE TO HIM. Narrator: THAT IS, UNTIL ONE GIRL CAPTURES CORY'S ATTENTION, 23-YEAR-OLD CATHERINA ROSE. CATHERINA. THEY CALL ME CAT FOR SHORT. SHE HAD THAT SPARK OF JUST FUN AND LIGHTHEARTEDNESS, AND I GRAVITATED TOWARDS HER BECAUSE OF THAT. AND I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DID. IT'S VERY STRONG. SHE WAS DEFINITELY A PARTY TYPE OF GIRL. HE WAS MORE RESERVED, QUIET. THEY SAY OPPOSITES ATTRACT. I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY GOT TOGETHER. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THE PAIR APPEARED TO FALL FOR EACH OTHER. Doyle: I FELT LIKE THEY HAD A GOOD RELATIONSHIP. SHE CARED A LOT ABOUT CORY, AND I SAW THAT. I FELT THAT THEY WERE IN LOVE. Narrator: A COUPLE OF MONTHS LATER, CORY CALLS HIS FAMILY BACK IN ILLINOIS WITH SOME SHOCKING NEWS: CAT IS PREGNANT, AND HE'S ASKED HER TO MARRY HIM. I WAS SURPRISED AND A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I WAS PLEASED THAT HE WAS DOING THE RESPONSIBLE THING. CHECK OUT THE SHIPS. THEY'RE MASSIVE. WE ALL HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT WITH THEM. THAT WAS THE FIRST CHANCE THAT ANY OF US HAD REALLY HAD TO MEET HER. SHE WASN'T A CALM PERSON. SHE DIDN'T SEEM MUCH LIKE A SHRINKING VIOLET, BUT SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE THE SELF-ASSUREDNESS THAT EVEN MY BROTHER DID. AND WHERE ARE YOU FROM, CATHERINA? Narrator: THERE SEEMS TO BE A REASON FOR THAT. CAT TELLS CORY'S FAMILY A HEARTBREAKING TALE ABOUT HER CHILDHOOD IN THE SOVIET UNION. HER AMERICAN-BORN MOTHER ABANDONED THE FAMILY, LEAVING HER TO BE RAISED BY A STRICT UKRAINIAN FATHER. ACCORDING TO CAT, SHE WAS ALL ALONE IN VIRGINIA WHEN SHE MET CORY. I FEEL LIKE HER LIFE WITH CORY WAS HER STARTING OVER, AND WHATEVER HAPPENED BEFORE THEN, SHE ALMOST WANTED TO BLOCK OUT. Dustin: I DIDN'T TRUST HER. I THINK I WAS THE LUCKY ONE. I DIDN'T THINK SHE WAS DANGEROUS. WHAT I DID THINK WAS THAT HE NEEDED TO BE ON HIS GUARD. Mother: I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MAKING ME A GRANDMOTHER. I FELT MY BROTHER COULD'VE DONE BETTER, BUT WE DO HAVE TO GET ALONG WITH HER, SO WE MADE AN EFFORT TO GET ALONG WITH HER. Narrator: IN OCTOBER OF 1998, CAT GIVES BIRTH TO A LITTLE GIRL. SIX MONTHS LATER, THE HAPPY PARENTS TIE THE KNOT. Doyle: THEY GOT MARRIED AT THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE, SO THEY NEVER HAD A HONEYMOON OR A WEDDING. SHE AND HIM KIND OF HAD TO JUMP RIGHT INTO BEING A FAMILY VERSUS HAVING THEIR TIME AS JUST A COUPLE. Narrator: THE FOLLOWING YEAR, THE VOSS FAMILY BECOMES EVEN BIGGER WITH THE BIRTH OF THEIR SECOND CHILD. Doyle: WHEN HE WAS THERE AT THE HOUSE, CORY WAS THE ONE TENDING TO THE KIDS, DOING THINGS WITH THEM. HE WAS A GOOD DAD. Dustin: HE HAD A SOLID HOME GOING ON, JUST, YOU KNOW, DOMESTIC LIFE. HE WAS MANAGING IT. HE WAS DOING IT. Narrator: BUT ONGOING FINANCIAL TROUBLES ARE CAUSING THE COUPLE'S RELATIONSHIP TO FRACTURE. IT SEEMS CAT IS SPENDING MONEY QUICKER THAN CORY CAN EARN IT. SHE DID HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SPENDING. SHE WAS VERY IRRESPONSIBLE WITH MONEY. SHE SEEMED TO BUY A LOT THAT SHE COULDN'T AFFORD BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO HAVE WHAT OTHERS HAD AND KIND OF MAKING PEOPLE WANT HER LIFE. SHE ALWAYS MADE YOU FEEL LIKE MONEY WASN'T AN ISSUE. I THINK IT WAS HER TRYING TO FILL A VOID, YOU KNOW, WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER. HE WASN'T GREAT WITH MONEY HIMSELF, SO THAT DIDN'T HELP. Narrator: TO COVER THEIR GROWING DEBT, CORY BORROWS MONEY FROM HIS FAMILY. HE ALSO TAKES THE AMBITIOUS STEP OF APPLYING TO OFFICER CANDIDATE SCHOOL. MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE ENLISTEES DON'T BECOME OFFICERS. THAT'S JUST VERY RARE TO HAVE SOMEONE GO FROM ONE TO THE OTHER. HOW'S IT GOING? CORY WANTED TO MAKE CATHERINA PROUD. YOU KNOW, HE WANTED TO SUCCEED AND BE AN OFFICER, AND I THINK SHE PUSHED HIM TO BE BETTER. Rilee: CORY WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF HIS FAMILY. THAT CERTAINLY CAME FIRST TO HIM. HIS KIDS AND WITH CAT THAT HE WANTED THINGS TO WORK, AND HE WAS TRYING HIS BEST TO PROVIDE EVERYTHING THAT HE COULD FOR HIS FAMILY. Narrator: IN 2006, CORY GRADUATES FROM THE PROGRAM AND IS COMMISSIONED AS A NAVAL ENSIGN. WITH IT COMES NEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR BOTH HIM AND CAT. SHE WAS PRETTY PROUD OF THE RANK HE HAD GOTTEN. SHE WAS PLEASED THAT HE WAS MOVING UP IN THE RANKS. IF YOU ARE AN OFFICER'S WIFE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKED AT AS BEING THE ELITE OF THE MILITARY COMMUNITY, AND THE MONEY IS OBVIOUSLY A BIG FACTOR IN IT. CAT WANTED A HOUSE. THEY BOUGHT A HOUSE THAT HAD A POOL. SHE DROVE A BMW, WHICH THEY OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T AFFORD, SO SHE LIVED WELL BEYOND HER MEANS. FROM WHAT MY BROTHER TOLD ME, SHE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON, LIKE, JEWELRY, COSMETICS, THAT KIND OF THING. BOUGHT A BIG, HUGE-SCREEN TV, ALL-NEW FURNITURE. SHE DECKED OUT THE HOUSE WITH ALL-NEW DECORATIONS. Narrator: BUT CORY'S PROMOTION ISN'T ALL GOOD NEWS. INSTEAD OF WORKING ON BASE, HE'S REGULARLY SENT OFF ON 6-MONTH DEPLOYMENTS. Dujardin: NOW, WHEN SAILORS ARE ON DEPLOYMENT, IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME FOR THE WIFE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT EXTRA SUPPORT WITH THE KIDS. SHE HAD TO BE RELIED ON 100 PERCENT BY THEM, AND THAT WAS HARD FOR HER. Narrator: AND AS CORY'S TIME AWAY ADDS UP, THEIR RELATIONSHIP STRAINS EVEN MORE. I DIDN'T THINK THAT HE COULD DEPEND ON HER, AND HE DIDN'T THINK HE COULD DEPEND ON HER. Narrator: BUT CORY ISN'T THE ONLY ONE GETTING ANGRY. CATHERINA IS STRUGGLING WITH THE FEAR NO WOMAN WANTS TO FACE. SHE WAS CONCERNED THAT HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A WOMAN ON THE SHIP. AND SHE SAID, "I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE HIM." All: CHEERS! ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: NINE YEARS AFTER THEY FIRST MET, CORY AND CATHERINA VOSS'S MARRIAGE IS FALLING APART, AND THEIR PERSONAL ISSUES ARE THE WORST-KEPT SECRET. I KNEW THAT CORY WASN'T HAPPY WITH THE MARRIAGE. I FIGURED THAT WAS MOSTLY DUE TO FINANCIAL ISSUES. CATHERINA WAS THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT NEEDED SOMEONE THERE ALL THE TIME. SHE WAS VERY CONCERNED THAT HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH A WOMAN ON THE SHIP. I REMEMBER HER SHOWING ME PICTURES OF THIS WOMAN, AND SHE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT IT. Narrator: INSTEAD OF STAYING HOME, CAT FEELS HER BEST REVENGE IS TO PARTY WITH HER FRIENDS. All: CHEERS! Rilee: CAT LIKED TO GO OUT, DRINK, AND PARTY. AND SHE OFTENTIMES OR ROUTINELY PICKED UP THE TABS AND TIPPED PRETTY LARGELY FOR HER AND HER FRIENDS. LADIES, THIS ONE IS ON ME. I WAS SURPRISED WHEN CATHERINA WOULD INITIALLY BUST OUT A $100 BILL AND GIVE IT TO THE BARTENDER, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I DIDN'T WANT TO QUESTION IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET HER. THAT WAS GOOD, MUCH BETTER. Rilee: CORY FELT AS IF HE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO TRY AND FIX IT WHEN HE GOT HOME. WHERE ARE GETTING $100 BILLS? THE INABILITY TO DO THAT WHEN YOU'RE OUT TO SEA I THINK FRUSTRATED HIM AND CREATED MORE TENSION AND PROBLEMS WITH THE MARRIAGE. Narrator: AND SOON CAT'S ATTENTION TURNS TO SOMEONE ELSE: 27-YEAR-OLD MICHAEL DRAVEN. Doyle: CATHERINA CALLED ME, AND SHE SAID SHE'D MET THIS GUY ON MYSPACE. HIS NAME WAS MICHAEL, AND SHE LIKED HIM. HE WAS INTO PHOTOGRAPHY. SHE GAVE ME THE INFO SO I COULD LOOK HIM UP, AND HE HAD A LOT OF, LIKE, DARK KIND OF GOTHIC PICTURES ON HIS SITE. HIS APPEARANCE WAS MENACING, DEVILISH, NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU'D WANT TO RUN ACROSS ON, LIKE, A DARK ALLEY. MICHAEL DRAVEN PORTRAYED HIMSELF AS A FILM PRODUCER AND A PHOTOGRAPHER - - BIZARRE INDIVIDUAL. I JUST WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED THAT SHE WOULD ENTERTAIN HANGING OUT WITH THIS GUY, BUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIM REALLY JUST DREW HER IN. I WAS REALLY NAIVE IN THE BEGINNING. IT WASN'T UNTIL LATER I REALIZED THAT THEY WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR. SHE HAD A SENSE THAT SHE WAS THIS QUEEN-TYPE FIGURE AND THAT SHE DESERVED THIS GREAT LIFESTYLE. THIS GUY MICHAEL WAS DOTING ON HER. AND SHE TOLD ME THAT HE'D HAD A LOT OF MONEY. HE LIVED IN A REALLY FANCY NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE FIRST TIME THEY HUNG OUT, HE POINTED OUT A HOUSE, A BIG HOUSE, AND TOLD HER HE LIVED THERE. LET ME SEE THE OTHER WAY. Narrator: EVERYTHING MICHAEL TELLS HER IS A LIE. HE DOESN'T PRODUCE MOVIES. HE'S NOT WEALTHY. HE DELIVERS NEWSPAPERS AND GETS PAID TO BE A MEDICAL TEST SUBJECT. Doyle: SHE SAID HE DOESN'T REALLY LIVE IN A BIG FANCY NEIGHBORHOOD. HE ACTUALLY LIVES IN A TRAILER WITH HIS MOM. AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I SAID, "REALLY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" Narrator: DESPITE THE LIES, CAT DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND. SHE'S TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE EXCITEMENT OF THE AFFAIR. MICHAEL DRAVEN WAS KIND OF A LOSER, AND THEN HE MEETS THIS WOMAN WHO'S WITH THIS HUSBAND WHO'S GOT A NICE HOUSE. THEY HAVE TWO GREAT KIDS. THEY HAVE A SWIMMING POOL IN THEIR BACKYARD. HE WANTS THAT LIFE. Doyle: I SAID, "WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO KEEP TALKING TO HIM, ARE YOU? I MEAN, THIS GUY IS A LIAR." SHE WAS LIKE, "WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK HE WAS JUST EMBARRASSED." YOU KNOW, SHE MADE AN EXCUSE FOR HIM, AND IT JUST WENT FROM THERE. Narrator: AFTER 6 MONTHS AWAY, THE USS ELROD AND CORY VOSS RETURN TO PORT. Dustin: HE WAS DEFINITELY EXCITED ABOUT BEING DEPLOYED. IT WAS A GOOD SHIP. HE WAS PRETTY PROUD OF THAT. HE WAS HAPPY ABOUT THE CRUISE WHEN HE GOT BACK. Narrator: MOST OF ALL, CORY IS HAPPY TO BE BACK HOME WITH HIS FAMILY. CAT TOLD A FEW FRIENDS SHE WAS GOING TO ASK FOR A DIVORCE, BUT SEEING CORY SEEMS TO CHANGE HER HEART. NICE TO SEE YOU. NICE TO SEE YOU, TOO. I REALLY MISSED YOU. I MISSED YOU, TOO. HE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO GET ALONG WITH HER AND, YOU KNOW, BE A GOOD HUSBAND AND FATHER. HE WAS GREAT WITH HIS KIDS. THEY LOVED HIM. HE LOVED THEM. Dujardin: HE WOULD SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM, PLAY SPORTS WITH THEM OUTSIDE, PLAY FOOTBALL, PLAY CATCH WITH THEM, JUST PLAY OUT IN THE YARD WITH THEM ALL THE TIME. Doyle: CATHERINA CALLED ME UP, AND SHE SAID, "YEAH, YOU KNOW, CORY AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND WORK THINGS OUT." IT WAS A TOTAL 180 FROM WHAT SHE HAD TOLD ME. AND I SAID, "WELL, GOOD, YOU KNOW? I'M GLAD. I WANT YOU TO STAY TOGETHER." Narrator: THAT SPRING, THE VOSS MARRIAGE SEEMS TO BE ON THE MEND. AND ON A WARM APRIL NIGHT, THE COUPLE PUT THEIR KIDS TO BED BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO A ROMANTIC DINNER. OH, SHOOT! WHAT IS IT? WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO GO TO THE ATM AND GET THE KIDS' LUNCH MONEY? Rilee: CAT ASKED HIM TO RETRIEVE $60, AND SHE PROVIDED HIM AN ATM CARD TO RETRIEVE THAT MONEY. Dujardin: HE WAS KIND OF BEING THE DUTIFUL HUSBAND TO GO TO THE ATM FOR HER. BE CAREFUL. Narrator: THE BANK IS LESS THAN 3 MILES AWAY. CAT CALLED HIM AND TALKED WITH HIM ALL THE WAY TO THE ATM AND ACTUALLY TALKED WITH HIM BY TELEPHONE WHILE HE WAS AT THE ATM. JUST BE CAREFUL, OKAY? I LOVE YOU. Narrator: TWO HOURS LATER, CORY MYSTERIOUSLY HASN'T RETURNED. CAT CALLS HIM REPEATEDLY WITH NO RESPONSE. SHE CALLED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO REPORT HIM MISSING, AND THEN SHE CALLED A COUPLE LOCAL HOSPITALS AND SOME OTHER PLACES TO SEE IF HE HAD SHOWN UP THERE. ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: AT 6 A.M. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, CAT FRANTICALLY CALLS THE POLICE AGAIN. Rilee: OFFICER WAS DISPATCHED TO CAT'S HOUSE AND PROVIDED INFORMATION FROM THE SOURCE, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN CAT, AS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED HER TO MAKE THAT COMPLAINT. HE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK. I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS FROM MY SISTER AND MY MOTHER CALLING ME UP AND LETTING ME KNOW THAT THE POLICE WERE LOOKING FOR HIM AND FINDING OUT MORE INFORMATION. WE WORRIED ABOUT HIM, LIKE, BEING, LIKE, WAYLAID OR ROBBED OR WHATEVER. NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT WAS JUST THE GENERAL SORT OF WORRY THAT YOU HAVE WHEN SOMEBODY YOU KNOW IS MISSING, AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHY. Narrator: LATER THAT MORNING, A 911 CALL COMES IN FROM A NEARBY OFFICE COMPLEX. SOMEBODY ACTUALLY WAS HEADING TO WORK AND FOUND THIS MAN SLUMPED OVER INSIDE OF A PICKUP TRUCK. Rilee: AN INDIVIDUAL THAT'S EITHER PASSED OUT OR ASLEEP OR WHAT HAVE YOU IN THE PARKING LOT ADJACENT TO THE CREDIT UNION. Narrator: THE TRUCK BELONGS TO CORY VOSS. SIR, ARE YOU OKAY? CORY WAS SEATED STILL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF HIS TRUCK SORT OF SLUMPED OVER TO ONE SIDE... THIS IS SERGEANT WILLIAMS. ...WITH OBVIOUS GUNSHOT WOUNDS TO HIS CHEST. I FOUND THE MISSING VEHICLE. I NEED BACKUP. IT DID APPEAR THAT MAYBE CORY WAS TRYING TO EXIT THE VEHICLE BUT OBVIOUSLY WASN'T SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT. Narrator: 30-YEAR-OLD CORY VOSS IS PRONOUNCED DEAD. TO ALL ON THE SCENE, IT LOOKS LIKE A ROBBERY GONE WRONG. Dustin: IT WAS IN A SKETCHY PART OF TOWN. A RANDOM ROBBERY DIDN'T SEEM UNLIKELY. Narrator: BUT THERE'S MORE TO THIS PICTURE THAN MEETS THE EYE. THE WEIRD THING WAS, HE WASN'T ACTUALLY ROBBED. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: IN APRIL 2007, A LATE-NIGHT ATM RUN COSTS NAVY ENSIGN AND FATHER OF TWO CORY VOSS HIS LIFE. THIS IS OFFICER WILLIAMS. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS HOW HORRIFIC THIS WAS THAT SOMEONE WAS OUT JUST GETTING HIS MONEY AT AN ATM AND WAS KILLED. Rilee: ANYTHING INVOLVING MONEY, YOU WOULD INITIALLY THINK THAT IT'S A ROBBERY, BUT THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT STOOD OUT, SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS. TYPICALLY, IN AN ARMED ROBBERY WHERE THERE'S A CONFRONTATION BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE, THE GOAL OF THE PERP IS TO TAKE THE MONEY AND LEAVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND IF THERE'S A SHOT OR TWO SHOTS FIRED, THAT'S TYPICALLY WHAT YOU WOULD SEE IN A ROBBERY. Narrator: CORY'S BEEN SHOT FIVE TIMES AT CLOSE RANGE. Dujardin: ONE WAS TO HIS CHEST, ONE WAS TO HIS ABDOMEN, AND ONE WAS TO HIS ARM. Rilee: I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONAL SITUATIONS, BUT TYPICALLY YOU WOULDN'T SEE THAT MANY SHOTS TAKING PLACE IN A ROBBERY. Narrator: POLICE ALSO FIND IT STRANGE THAT THE KILLER MADE CORY DRIVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION BEFORE SHOOTING HIM. WHY DIDN'T HE JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN? MY SERGEANT AND I RESPONDED TO THE HOUSE TO SPEAK WITH CAT. AS A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE, THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE THING THAT WE HAVE TO DO, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE DONE, AND THERE IS NO EASY WAY TO DO IT. AND HE ANSWERED THE PHONE. BUT WE GET THROUGH IT AND DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. Narrator: WHEN THEY ARRIVE, THEY BREAK THE HORRIBLE NEWS TO A SEEMINGLY DEVASTATED CATHERINA. Rilee: SHE BECAME HYSTERICAL TO THE POINT THAT I OFFERED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE FOR HER TO CARRY HER TO THE HOSPITAL. SHE DENIED THAT REQUEST, BUT SHE WAS VERY, VERY UPSET, FALLING ON THE FLOOR, SCREAMING AND CRYING. Narrator: WHEN CAT RECOVERS, POLICE QUESTION HER ABOUT THE MISSING PERSONS REPORT AND THE PREVIOUS NIGHT'S EVENTS. SHE PROVIDED US DETAILS AS TO WHEN HE LEFT THE HOUSE, WHY HE LEFT THE HOUSE, WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO. SHE PROVIDED US INFORMATION RELATING TO THOSE PHONE CALLS THAT SHE HAD MADE. DID YOU GET TO THE ATM YET? THE FACT THAT CAT HAD CALLED AND TALKED WITH HIM SEVERAL TIMES, AS SHE SAID, TO THE ATM, WHILE HE WAS AT THE ATM AND WARNED HIM TO BE CAREFUL, IT JUST SEEMED LIKE TOO MUCH INFORMATION. THE ATM WAS LOCATED LESS THAN 3 MILES FROM THEIR HOME, SO IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME, YOU TYPICALLY WOULDN'T BE CONCERNED THAT YOUR LOVED ONE WOULD NOT MAKE IT TO THAT ATM AND BACK HOME. Narrator: THAT AFTERNOON, THE LOCAL NEWS SPREADS WORD OF CORY'S MURDER ACROSS NEWPORT NEWS AND THE NORFOLK NAVAL COMMUNITY. THE INITIAL RESPONSE WAS SHOCK THAT SOMEBODY WAS KILLED AND ALSO JUST WHO HE WAS, A RESPECTED NAVAL OFFICER, SO IT WAS JUST SHOCK, THAT "WHO DID THIS? HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN?" I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS, AND I SAW CORY'S TRUCK ON THE SCREEN, AND I WAS LIKE, "WAIT A MINUTE." AND THEN I STARTED LISTENING, AND THEY HAD SAID THAT THEY HAD FOUND A BODY IN THE TRUCK, AND I JUST... MY HEART SANK WHEN I SAW IT. Dustin: MY SISTER CALLED ME UP, AND SHE WAS HESITANT ABOUT BRINGING IT UP, YOU KNOW, LIKE, "WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS." LONG PAUSE. "THEY FOUND CORY. HE'S DEAD. HE WAS SHOT. WE DON'T REALLY KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT IT YET." I WAS VERY SAD, OBVIOUSLY, HAD MYSELF A GOOD CRY. Narrator: AMONG THE FIRST THINGS INVESTIGATORS DO IS CHECK THE BANK'S SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS. Doyle: THE VIDEO AT THE CREDIT UNION THAT WAS TAKEN AT THE ATM, AND YOU COULD SEE CORY TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF THE ATM. Rilee: IT WAS NOT A REAL CLEAR PHOTOGRAPH, BUT WE COULD SEE THAT SOMEONE MASKED HAD ENTERED THE PASSENGER SIDE OF HIS VEHICLE. Dujardin: JUST OPENED THE DOOR TO THE PICKUP TRUCK AND CAME IN. SO HE APPARENTLY MADE CORY DRIVE A LITTLE BIT AWAY, AND THEN HE SHOT HIM. NO, PLEASE. LOOK, I HAVE A FAMILY. I HAVE TWO KIDS. DON'T... AND THEN NOT EVEN A QUARTER MILE AWAY WAS WHERE THE PICKUP TRUCK WAS FOUND. Narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, THE QUALITY OF THE IMAGE IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR AN I. D. WELL, A PORTION OF THE PERSON'S FACE WAS BLOCKED BY THE MIRROR OR A PORTION OF THE CAR, AND IT WASN'T EVEN CLEAR ENOUGH TO TELL EXACTLY WHAT THE WEAPON WAS. WE ACTUALLY TRIED TO HAVE THE PHOTO ENHANCED, BUT WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT. Narrator: ONE THING DETECTIVES ARE STARTLED TO FIND OUT IS THAT NO MONEY WAS EVER DISPENSED FROM THE ATM. WE ALL STARTED OUT ASSUMING IT WAS A RANDOM ROBBERY. THE ONLY WEIRD THING WAS, HE WASN'T ACTUALLY ROBBED. THAT WAS REALLY THE PUZZLING THING ABOUT IT. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: IN THE WAKE OF CORY'S MURDER, THERE'S A HUGE OUTPOURING OF SYMPATHY AND SUPPORT FOR HIS WIFE, CAT. Dustin: SHE WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT IT. SHE WAS CRYING ENOUGH IT GOT ME CRYING. IT WAS VERY CONTAGIOUS, CONTAGIOUS CRYING GOING ON THERE. SHE JUST CAME ACROSS AS THIS REALLY DISTRAUGHT NAVY WIFE WHO WAS JUST REALLY UPSET THAT HER HUSBAND WAS KILLED. Narrator: WITH NO CLEAR-CUT MOTIVE AND LACKING A SUSPECT, THE CRITICAL FIRST 24 HOURS GO BY. FOR INVESTIGATORS AND HIS FAMILY, FEAR GROWS THAT CORY'S ATTACKER WILL GET AWAY WITH MURDER. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY ARRESTED, SO, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A MYSTERY TO IT. WAS THERE SOMEBODY ON THE LOOSE WHO KILLED SOMEBODY AT AN ATM? THEY DIDN'T KNOW. Narrator: THEN A PHONE CALL TO POLICE CHANGES EVERYTHING. Rilee: WE DIDN'T KNOW WHO SHE WAS. SHE BECAME A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. Narrator: SOMEONE HAS A SECRET THEY NEED TO REVEAL. IT WAS, LIKE, INSTANTANEOUS. I JUST KNEW WHAT HAPPENED. I'M THE HUSBAND THAT SURVIVED. ♪♪♪♪ Cory: PLEASE, PLEASE, I HAVE A FAMILY. Narrator: FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS, THE TRAGIC MURDER OF NAVY ENSIGN CORY VOSS HAS HAD POLICE ACROSS NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA SCRAMBLING FOR CLUES. BUT NOW THEY HAVE A PROMISING LEAD. IT'S AN ANONYMOUS CALL TO THEIR TIP LINE, A WOMAN CLAIMING TO BE A FRIEND WITH A SECRET TO TELL. I JUST KNEW WHAT SHE HAD DONE. AND THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT, AND I CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT, YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T FAIR TO CORY NOT TO SAY SOMETHING. Narrator: WHEN QUESTIONED, ASHLEY DOYLE REVEALS HER IDENTITY AND IS PERSUADED TO MEET WITH INVESTIGATORS. Doyle: THEY SHOWED ME THE PICTURES FROM THE ATM, AND THEY WERE INCREDIBLY EERIE. YOU COULD SEE CORY TRYING TO GET MONEY OUT OF THE ATM, AND YOU COULD SEE THE GUNMAN, AND I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT, "OH, MY GOD. IT'S MICHAEL. MICHAEL KILLED CORY," AND IT JUST SENT A CHILL DOWN MY SPINE. SHE TOLD US THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT A GUY NAMED MICHAEL DRAVEN BECAUSE HE MAY BE INVOLVED IN THIS MURDER. SHE WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE US VERY TIMELY INFORMATION ON THE ONGOING RELATIONSHIP OF CAT VOSS AND MICHAEL DRAVEN, PURCHASES THAT WERE MADE, PLACED THAT THEY WERE GOING AND THINGS THAT THEY WERE DOING. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS THEN SEARCH CAT AND MICHAEL'S SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES. THEY'RE SHOCKED BY WHAT THEY DISCOVER. Dujardin: MICHAEL POSTED A PICTURE THAT HAD CATHERINA AND CORY'S DAUGHTER. AND MICHAEL DRAVEN REFERRED TO THEM AS, "THIS IS MY WIFE AND MY DAUGHTER," WHICH WAS - - I FOUND REALLY BIZARRE. Rilee: WE CERTAINLY WERE INTERESTED IN THAT RELATIONSHIP, AND OUR SUSPICIONS WERE OBVIOUSLY RAISED. WHAT I HAVE IS A TRANSMITTER. Narrator: POLICE THEN ENLIST ASHLEY FOR MORE HELP. Doyle: THEY WANTED ME TO GO OUT WITH CATHERINA, TRY TO GET INFORMATION FROM HER, MAYBE POSSIBLY A CONFESSION OR ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP THEM. CALL MRS. VOSS AND SET UP A TIME TO MEET. I CALL CATHERINA. SHE SOUNDED VERY SAD ON THE PHONE. SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD NO IDEA WHY SOMEBODY WOULD DO THIS TO CORY. SHE WANTED TO ARRANGE THE FUNERAL AND EVERYTHING, BUT SHE WAS JUST VERY, VERY UPSET, AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT. HOW ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT? AT THAT POINT, I ASKED IF SHE WANTED ME TO COME OVER AND TALK TO HER. IT'S SO GREAT TO SEE YOU. HI, CAT. THANKS FOR COMING. I MISSED YOU. TAKE A SEAT. WE HAD A CAMERA THAT WAS INSERTED INTO HER HANDBAG, AND, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS ASKED TO PLACE IT IN A PARTICULAR AREA SO THAT SHE COULD TRY AND DOCUMENT THE CONVERSATION. Doyle: IT WAS REALLY NERVE-WRACKING. I WAS SCARED THE WHOLE TIME. I THOUGHT FOR SURE SHE WAS GOING TO SEE IT OR KNOW THAT I HAD A WIRE. Rilee: I THINK SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS BETRAYING HER FRIEND IN THE EVENT IT TURNED OUT THAT CAT HADN'T BEEN INVOLVED. THEY'VE ALREADY GIVEN ME $100,000. Narrator: AS CAT CONTINUES TO TALK, HER FOCUS IS MORE ON THE MONEY THAN ON SOLVING CORY'S MURDER. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. YEAH, IT'S GOING TO SET UP MY KIDS FOR LIFE. WE KNOW THAT WITHIN LESS THAN 3 DAYS OF CORY BEING MURDERED THAT SHE WAS PROVIDED A BENEFIT FROM THE NAVY. Narrator: A BENEFIT WORTH HALF A MILLION DOLLARS. THEY ONLY GAVE HER $250,000 INITIALLY. THEY HAD TO, I GUESS, DO AN INVESTIGATION BEFORE SHE GOT THE OTHER HALF. THAT WAS HER MAIN CONCERN, WAS THE MONEY AND WHY SHE WASN'T GETTING THE FULL $500,000. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS HAPPENING? WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG? THEY OWE ME $500,000. WE HAD PUT A HOLD ON THAT UNTIL THE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE, AND SHE COULD'VE BEEN RULED OUT AS A SUSPECT. Narrator: IT'S A STANDARD PRACTICE BUT ONE THAT HAS CATHERINA VERY UPSET Rilee: CATHERINA HAD MADE THIS COMPLAINT TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND TO ALL OF HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY THAT WE WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING AND THAT THE INVESTIGATION WASN'T GOING TO BE SOLVED AND HOW BADLY SHE WANTED IT SOLVED. WHAT I DESERVE. IT'S WHAT THE KIDS DESERVE. Narrator: THE MORE ASHLEY GETS CAT TO TALK, THE MORE CONVINCED SHE IS HER FRIEND HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH CORY'S MURDER, AND IT MAKES HER INCREASINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO BE THERE. Rilee: ASHLEY WAS A BIT NERVOUS AND AT ONE POINT FELT AS IF CAT RECOGNIZED SOMETHING SUSPICIOUS. I HAVE TO GO. Doyle: I KEPT THINKING SHE WAS GOING TO KNOW. I FORGOT. AND THEN IT COULD ESCALATE IF SHE KILLED CORY. YOU KNOW, WOULD SHE KILL ME, TOO? WHAT IS SHE CAPABLE OF? BYE. Narrator: THREE WEEKS LATER, WITH POLICE UNABLE TO PROVE ANYTHING, CAT AND MICHAEL HEAD OFF TO NORTH CAROLINA'S OUTER BANKS ON VACATION. UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM, THEIR EVERY MOVE IS WATCHED. WE FOUND OUT THEY STAYED IN A LUXURY SUITE. THEY BLEW THROUGH, LIKE, $10,000 JUST BUYING JEWELRY. SHE MAY NOT HAVE LOVED MY BROTHER A LOT, BUT SHE DID CARE FOR HIM. THAT'S WHAT I HAD THOUGHT. THIS BEHAVIOR AFTER SHE GOT HER INSURANCE MONEY MADE ME QUESTION EXACTLY HOW MUCH AFFECTION SHE HAD FOR HIM. Narrator: MEANWHILE, DETECTIVES SUBPOENA HER BANK RECORDS, REVEALING A CURIOUS DISCOVERY. THE ACCOUNT CORY TRIED TO ACCESS HAD BEEN OPENED JUST 6 DAYS BEFORE HIS MURDER, AND IT NEVER HAD MORE THAN $5 IN IT. Rilee: THERE WERE THREE ATTEMPTS TO MAKE A WITHDRAWAL: $60, THEN $40, THEN $20, ALL OF WHICH THERE WERE INSUFFICIENT FUNDS. THE THEORY FOR THAT IS THAT SHE DIDN'T JUST WANT HIM TO GO IN, GET THE MONEY AND LEAVE. SHE WANTED HIM TO STRUGGLE THERE. Narrator: PERHAPS THE MOST DAMNING SURPRISE IS THAT THE ACCOUNT IS COSIGNED BY CAT'S BOYFRIEND, MICHAEL DRAVEN. I MEAN, WHERE WAS HER CONSCIENCE? DID SHE EVER STOP AND THINK? Narrator: A DEEPER DIVE INTO CATHERINA'S BACKGROUND TURNS UP EVEN MORE SHOCKING REVELATIONS. CAT ISN'T THE UKRAINIAN IMMIGRANT SHE PRETENDS TO BE. SHE'S A LOCAL GIRL, KATHLEEN WIGGINS. Doyle: SHE GREW UP IN NEWPORT NEWS, BUT SHE PRETENDED THAT SHE WAS SOMEONE ELSE. THE WHOLE TIME WE KNEW EACH OTHER, OUR WHOLE FRIENDSHIP, I CALLED HER CATHERINA. SHE WAS AN ACTRESS IN A LOT OF WAYS. SHE PUT ON THIS PERSONA OF WHO SHE WANTED PEOPLE TO THINK SHE WAS, AND SHE WAS VERY CONVINCING. Rilee: CAT GRADUATED FROM SCHOOL HERE, HAD BEEN MARRIED ONE TIME PREVIOUSLY. Narrator: JUST AFTER FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL, SHE AND BOYFRIEND STEVE LARSON WED. I MET HER IN HIGH SCHOOL. I DID FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. I WANT TO SAY I WAS YOUNG AND DUMB. Narrator: STEVE JOINS THE ARMY TO SUPPORT THEM, AND THE RELATIONSHIP SOON FOLLOWS A FAMILIAR PATTERN: LONG DEPLOYMENTS, MANIC SHOPPING, AND ULTIMATELY INFIDELITY. WHEN I CAME HOME FROM KOREA, SHE STOOD ME UP AT THE AIRPORT, AND THEN WHEN SHE DID FINALLY SHOW UP, SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS 3 MONTHS PREGNANT. Narrator: PREGNANT WITH CORY VOSS'S BABY. I HAD STARTED GOING TO CHURCH AND EVERYTHING IN THE MILITARY, AND, YOU KNOW, I WAS WILLING TO FORGIVE AND FORGET AND MOVE ON. Narrator: KATHLEEN WANTED STEVE OUT OF THE PICTURE, PICKING FIGHTS WHENEVER SHE GOT THE CHANCE. SHE CHANGED WHILE I WAS GONE. SHE'S NOT THE SAME PERSON. THERE WAS ONE NIGHT WE HAD A FIGHT, AND I TRIED TO KEEP WALKING AWAY AND EVERYTHING, AND SHE JUST WANTED TO CORNER ME. AT ONE POINT, I ACTUALLY BROKE THE WINDOW OUT, AND I CLIMBED OUT THE WINDOW. I WAS DONE WITH HER HURTING ME, AND AFTER I SIGNED THAT DIVORCE PAPER, WE NEVER, NEVER TALKED AGAIN. Narrator: STEVE'S TROUBLING ACCOUNT ADDS TO THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL CASE AGAINST CAT, BUT SHE DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER IN HER HUSBAND'S MURDER. [ GUNSHOT ] ♪♪♪♪ I DON'T THINK WE HAD ANY IDEA OF HOW MANY TWISTS AND TURNS THE CASE WOULD ULTIMATELY TAKE. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: INVESTIGATORS ARE CONVINCED CAT VOSS AND MICHAEL DRAVEN ARRANGED CORY VOSS'S MURDER FOR FINANCIAL GAIN, BUT THEY STILL NEED HARD EVIDENCE TO PUT THE PIECES OF THIS CONSPIRACY TOGETHER. WE BELIEVED EARLY ON THAT MICHAEL DRAVEN HAD HAD INVOLVEMENT IN THE MURDER, BUT WE WEREN'T SURE WHETHER HE ACTUALLY WAS THE GUNMAN AS WE COULDN'T GET A CLEAR IDENTITY FROM THE SURVEILLANCE PHOTO. SO WE CONTINUED LOOKING AS TO WHAT OTHER POSSIBILITIES MAY BE THERE. Narrator: DELVING INTO DRAVEN'S PAST, INVESTIGATORS LEARN THAT A MONTH BEFORE THE MURDER, HE SPENT SOME TIME IN CITY JAIL ON A DOMESTIC ABUSE WARRANT. Rilee: DURING THOSE 6 OR 7 DAYS THAT HE WAS INCARCERATED, WE DID FIND A NUMBER OF PHONE CALLS THAT WERE MADE FROM THE JAIL THAT WERE RECORDED. THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE TO CAT VOSS. THEY TALKED ABOUT EVERYTHING FROM GETTING MARRIED TO WHERE THEY WERE GOING TO GET MARRIED, THEIR FUTURE TOGETHER. ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ ♪♪♪♪ THEY WERE SPEAKING ABOUT THIS PLAN TO KILL CORY FROM THE JAIL. WHAT THOSE PHONE CALLS PROVIDED US WAS THE BELIEF THAT THERE WAS A THIRD PARTY NOW INVOLVED. WE WERE ABLE TO COMPARE CAT'S PHONE RECORDS THAT WE HAD RECOVERED AND RETRIEVED AND ULTIMATELY IDENTIFY THE INDIVIDUAL KNOWN AS DAVID RUNYON. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS LEARN THAT DAVID RUNYON OF WEST VIRGINIA WAS A MARKSMAN IN THE MILITARY. WE LEARNED THAT HE CONDUCTED OR DID MEDICAL RESEARCH, AND THAT'S WHERE HE MET MICHAEL DRAVEN. IN DECEMBER OF 2007, WE HAD GATHERED ENOUGH INFORMATION AND EVIDENCE THAT WE WERE GOING TO EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANTS IN MORGANTOWN, WEST VIRGINIA SPECIFICALLY FOR DAVID RUNYON, HIS RESIDENCE AT THE TIME, A STORAGE SHED THAT HE RENTED, AND HIS VEHICLE. DAVID RUNYON? IN THE SEARCH OF THE TRUCK, MY PARTNER ACTUALLY FOUND IN THE CONSOLE, THERE'S A HIDDEN COMPARTMENT. AND IN THAT CONSOLE, THERE WAS A MAP OF NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA. ♪♪♪♪ AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF CAT VOSS AND MICHAEL DRAVEN IN HIS VEHICLE. ♪♪♪♪ WE OPENED THE MAP UP AND FOUND HANDWRITTEN NOTES WHICH INCLUDED THE CREDIT UNION'S NAME, THE ADDRESS, AND A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION OF CORY'S VEHICLE. ♪♪♪♪ Narrator: IT'S WHAT POLICE NEED TO ARREST ALL THREE PLAYERS IN THIS SINISTER PLOT. Rilee: MICHAEL DRAVEN WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HEADQUARTERS, AND WE SAT AND TALKED, AND ULTIMATELY HE CONFESSED THAT THIS WAS A PLANNED MURDER THAT CAT AND HE DEVISED AND HIRED DAVID RUNYON TO COMMIT. Draven: I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. MICHAEL IS THE ONE WHO THREW CATHERINA AND DAVID UNDER THE BUS. HE BASICALLY SOLD HIM OUT. CAT TOLD ME THAT CORY... CAT PROVIDED INFORMATION TO MICHAEL DRAVEN THAT CORY WAS ABUSING OR MISTREATING THE CHILDREN. AND I BELIEVE THAT MICHAEL DRAVEN BELIEVED THAT, AND THAT'S HOW SHE SORT OF COERCED HIM INTO LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO KILL HER HUSBAND. Narrator: POLICE CONVINCE MICHAEL TO LURE CAT TO THE STATION, PRETENDING HE HASN'T YET CONFESSED. I'M AT THE POLICE STATION. HE CALLED HER AND TOLD HER THAT HE WAS GOING TO TURN HIMSELF IN. SHE CURSED AT HIM AND SAID, "NO, DON'T DO IT! I'LL BE THERE. I'LL COME THERE TO GET YOU. DON'T GO IN THERE." AND SHE ACTUALLY DROVE DOWN TO THE POLICE STATION. SHE WAS STOPPED BY DETECTIVES THAT WERE OUTSIDE WAITING ON HER. Narrator: ON DECEMBER 14, 2007, 8 MONTHS AFTER CORY'S MURDER, CAT VOSS IS ARRESTED AND CHARGED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CRIME. SHE WASTES NO TIME POINTING THE FINGER AT EVERYONE ELSE. I BELIEVE KATHLEEN TRIED TO MANIPULATE THE SITUATION TO HAVE IT LOOK MORE LIKE A MURDER VERSUS A MURDER FOR HIRE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON. WHENEVER KATHLEEN STARTS HER LIES, I DO BELIEVE SHE TRULY BELIEVES WHAT SHE'S SAYING. IT WASN'T ME! Narrator: BUT NO ONE IS BUYING IT. CAT NEVER THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO BE CAUGHT. Narrator: SEVEN MONTHS LATER, CAT HEADS TO COURT. TO AVOID THE DEATH PENALTY, SHE AGREES TO PLEAD GUILTY TO CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER FOR HIRE. SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD SET THIS UP. SHE ADMITTED THAT SHE HAD HIM GO TO THE ATM TO GET THE MONEY, THAT SHE AND MICHAEL DRAVEN HIRED DAVID TO LIE IN WAIT AND KILL HIM. THAT'S THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU HEAR ABOUT IN, LIKE, SOAP OPERAS. IT REALLY ONLY WORKS IN FICTION. SHE JUST SEEMED FOOLISH AND STUPID AND GREEDY. Narrator: CAT IS SENTENCED TO FOUR LIFE TERMS IN PRISON, PLUS 20 ADDITIONAL YEARS. ON JULY 17, 2009, A FEDERAL JURY CONVICTS MICHAEL DRAVEN AND DAVID RUNYON OF MURDER, CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER FOR HIRE, AND CARJACKING. MICHAEL DRAVEN AND DAVID RUNYON BOTH CHOSE TO GO TO TRIAL. MICHAEL DRAVEN RECEIVED TWO LIFE SENTENCES, AND DAVID RUNYON RECEIVED THE DEATH PENALTY. IT'S HARD WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT MY ROLE WAS IN THE PROCESS. I DO FEEL GUILTY FOR DOING WHAT I DID, BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. I COULDN'T LET CORY DIE AND NOBODY PAY FOR WHAT THEY DID TO HIM. IT WASN'T RIGHT WHAT WAS DONE, AND HE WAS TOO GOOD OF A GUY TO JUST, YOU KNOW, NOT SPEAK UP. Narrator: CORY'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE RELIEVED JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED, BUT THE PAIN OF THEIR LOSS ENDURES. Dustin: I WOULD'VE LIKED TO HAVE MORE TIME WITH CORY. I WOULD'VE LIKED TO SEE HOW HE TURNED OUT IN THE LONG RUN. I WOULD'VE LIKED TO SEE HIM SUCCEED EVEN MORE. I WOULD'VE LIKED TO SEE HIM RAISE UP HIS KIDS WELL AND SEE HIM GRADUATE AND ALL THAT. NONE OF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. Narrator: CORY TURNED AROUND HIS TROUBLED PAST AND HAD A LIMITLESS FUTURE AHEAD OF HIM. THE ONLY THING HE DID WRONG WAS LOVE THE WRONG WOMAN, AND HE PAID FOR IT WITH HIS LIFE. Rilee: CAT NEVER SHOWED ANY REMORSE. MY HONEST FEELING WAS THAT SHE WASN'T REMORSEFUL FOR WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE. SHE WAS REMORSEFUL BECAUSE SHE GOT CAUGHT. ♪♪♪♪
