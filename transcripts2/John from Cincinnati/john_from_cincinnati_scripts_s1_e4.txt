This can only attract new types Of shitheel into that boy's life, We're going to keep Our distance, I'm informing you Of that right now. We're not going To jockey for attention or be looked at As a nuisance, Like i saw last night in Shaun's grandmother's eyes When i was over At that house. Or stand in the street Amongst mopes, Like that hawaiian And his belt-high sidekick Or the soup brigade From that motel. I have plenty of tasks and Chores within this house That i've been Derelict attending to That will more than Occupy our time. There it is. That's it. That's the doomsday Scenario. May this pain come to clinton For disgracing the oval office. Ooh! Jesus christ, Jesus christ. That will Never happen again- A sequence of events So complated That butchie yost At the age of 10 Could help the only Woman in the world That when i pass a remark About some airhead pisspot That i collar, She has the sweetness to recall, "i wonder if it's that yost boy That used to help me With my groceries." I throw him a break Because of my darling lois, Keep one eye out after, since I unloosed him in society. That that- Looking out for butchie- Would later Cross my path with shaun When butchie became A junkie dumpster tenant, now who in his right mind would believe that that sequence Of events could be repeated?
