 [DICK] Previously on Titans... Welcome home, Rachel. When she was brought to us, Rachel was hiding from her father. Truth is, we should never have let you go. - I'm, uh, Gar. - I'm Rachel. - I like your hair. - Your hair is cool. That cop you told me about, he's not your father, is he? [RACHEL] No, no. Can you please tell me what the hell is going on? - You left me. - Rachel...

 [DEMONIC VOICE] Stop lying! [CAR ALARMS BLARING] [NORMAL VOICE] I need to go back to the Sisters! - [DICK] How long you been looking for Rachel? - [KORY] Few months, I thought. Seems like a lot longer than a few months. [KORY] I think she's part of a prophecy. [SISTER CATHERINE] I promised you'd be safe here, didn't I? They thought they could protect you. Let me in. [SCREAMING] She's the Destroyer of Worlds. [HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING] [ALARM WAILING] [INDISTINCT CLAMORING]

No, please don't go! Please! Don't leave me alone! Please! No... [MONITOR CONTINUES BEEPING] Hello? Hello? [GAR] Hello? [MAN] Yes, yes. Fascinating. We don't have much time, but I can save you. It's okay, my boy. [SCREAMING] [THEME MUSIC PLAYING] - Synced and corrected by VitoSilans - -- www.Addic7ed.com -- [RACHEL PANTING] [TIGER GROWLING] [DISTORTED GROWLING AND SQUELCHING] [GAR GROANING] [GASPS] How... How'd you... Don't worry. I don't bite. Well, come on. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] [OFFICER] Okay. [DICK] She must've lost control. [KORY] Maybe she's still here. Hey, where's Rachel? Is she okay? - She left. Ran. - What happened? Huh? We just wanted to keep her here. Keep her safe, that's all. Where no one could hurt her and she couldn't hurt anyone. - There's no stopping it now. - Stopping what? There's no stopping it now. Oh, God. God, forgive me. God, forgive us all. Why did you leave her here? In a convent full of nuns? Yeah, seemed real dangerous. You know, you're the one who stole my car and drove off. Yeah, I thought you could handle her for a few minutes, but I should've known better considering you ditched her in DC. I didn't mean to ditch her, okay? I was trying to... You just couldn't handle her, so you left her with your friends. It's pathetic. Look, can we argue about this after we find her, okay? She's getting more powerful. Yeah, but she's still a kid. Alone and scared and on the run. [GAR] It's not too far from here. We'll just warm up for a bit. What's not far from here? Where are we going? Someplace you can chill. I can't chill. You don't understand... I'm changing, and I can feel it. And it's getting worse. Well, no worse than the crew I live with. Trust me. We're, uh... special, too. I'm not special. I'm dangerous. You saw what I did back there. I... And you saw what I did back there. You're not scared of me, right? No. No. I blew the roof off a church. And you're still helping me, so... I got green hair. [CHUCKLES] Freaks all around, I guess. [GUNSHOT] Are we outta the huntin' zone? No. Yeah. Hell, I don't know. What's the difference? [CHUCKLES] Man, that was a shit shot. - Well, you missed altogether. - [SCOFFS] Well, I won't miss this one. Leave it alone. What the hell? Where'd you come from? Leave it alone. [CHUCKLES] Go home, girl. Go on. Get! [BEAST BOY GROWLING] [ROARS] - [GUNSHOT] - [GROANS] - You shot me! - Get outta here! [BEAST BOY ROARS] [BEAST BOY GRUNTING] Hey. Hey. Hey... Hey... [RACHEL SHUSHING] [GAR] Hey, uh... Don't look, yeah? I know you're scared. I'm sorry they did this to you. I should've done more than roar. The truth is, I've never bitten anybody before. Blood grosses me out. It's dead. You okay? [RACHEL SOBBING QUIETLY] I'm sorry. Rachel, there is nothing evil about you. Nothing at all. You don't know that. Yeah, I do. I have a pretty good instinct about this kind of thing. Come on. Whoa. You live there? Come on. - We're going down here? - Oh, yeah. Cool, huh? Come on. [SOFTLY] Go ahead. So, what is this place? I call it... Nirvana. - [ARCADE MUSIC PLAYING] - [VIDEO GAME VOICE] Bonus! Holy shit. You want a pop? I got everything. Root beer? Orange Crush? Grape Crush? Grape. [POP MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] That's an original. 1948. You ever see it? Aren't you a little young to be watching something so old? You mean "classic." I've got every Abbott and Costello Meet a Monster. Yeah, you're a geek, aren't ya? About classic films, vinyl, and video games, yeah, check, check, and check. - So where'd you get all this stuff? - Uh, you know. Around. It's, uh, vintage. [CHUCKLES] [GAR CHUCKLES] I don't get out that much. Yeah. Yeah, they, uh... They died. My mom died, too. She was all I had. So, who were the people you were with at the roller rink? Oh, you know, just people. So, if your parents are gone, um... who lives here? That is a complicated answer. [MAN] Gar! Uh-oh. - Who is that? - Uh, the complicated answer. - Gar! You down there? - Uh, you need to hide. Hide? From what? Just hide... Please. [HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] [MAN] Hey, Gar! [LOUD MUSIC PLAYING IN HEADPHONES] Gar! Oh. - Hey, Cliff. What's up, dude? - Who are you talking to? Uh... myself. Come on, Gar. You beat Super Mario World, you can beat this. [CLIFF] Oh. Where were you today? Down here. Duh. Bullshit. You went to town again. [CLEARS THROAT] Look, my controller broke and I had to go get a new one. Okay? I knew I could get there and back before Chief came home. Oh, shit. Kid! Relax. No one followed me. Kept a low profile. [CLIFF] You want to keep a low profile, you wear a hat. Ha, funny! You know, that's a good joke. I heard another good joke. Why was the robot mad? 'Cause someone kept pushing his buttons. [CLIFF LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] Keep pushing 'em, there'll be a green tiger-skin rug in my bedroom. Dinner. One hour. Come tell Larry what you want, brat. Okay. I'll be up in a minute. [CLIFF] I was not put on this Earth to babysit. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [GAR SIGHS] That was close. Two players? Gotcha! Come on, Cliff. It's all right, man. She's cool. I know, and she listens to all the right music, and she's just awesome. - And make her go. - What is this place? Who are you people? [GAR] Chief calls us "the conventionally challenged." And this place is... You need to go home, kid. [STUTTERING] Are you a robot? Or... [SIGHS] Here we go. He's a robotman. Oh, fuck me. Cliff was a race car driver. A pretty famous one, too. He got into a bad accident. His body was pretty much kaput. Chief managed to save his brain. [KNOCKING ON HEAD] - Knock it off. - What little there was left of it. Hey. She's gotta go before the Chief gets home. Who's the Chief? Well, he's the greatest doctor in the world. Saved all of us. All of you? Who else lives here? - [CLIFF GROANS] - Well, there's... You do realize this is supposed to be a secret, right? No, no. Let me get this straight. You want the Chief, who just learned to walk again, to walk into your dumbassery. I thought maybe Chief could help her. [CLIFF] Ooh, you hate her that much? Oh, shit. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS] [SIZZLING] Hey. Wow. Show's over. [VOLUME LOWERS] - [MAN] Who's this? - [GAR] That's Rachel. [CLIFF] I was just showing her out. [MAN] Out? Before Chief gets back. Are you invisible under there? Wouldn't that be nice? How do you like your steak? Unless you're a vegan, which would break my heart. She's not staying for dinner, Larry. It'll be fine. Chief is gone until tomorrow. And even with Rita, we have plenty of food. And I am hungry. And she is hungry. - It's nice here. - Right? Told ya. Let's take a vote. [CLIFF] Really? Great. Gar, go set the table. [DICK] She must be scared out of her mind. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - You're not coming. - What? Why? You're not exactly the definition of "blending in." I've blended in just fine. I've got the badge. I can find out if anyone's seen Rachel faster without you. Not to mention, you're wanted by the police. This is a police station. Hurry up. [OFFICER] Long way from Detroit, huh? My sister's kid. Ran away. We got a report on this earlier. Hunter shot himself. Said something about a tiger in the woods with a girl with purple hair, like this. - A tiger? - Yeah, a green one. He was drunk. What did you say that hunter's name was again? [LARRY] Then Cliff gets into an argument with the television. [CLIFF] I was not trying to talk to the TV. - I was whispering to you. - [LARRY] You were trying to. [CLIFF] "I hate this show. Please change it." You know, like that. - [LARRY LAUGHING] - [CLIFF] What? No, I don't want dessert! We talked about this! Rita? [MUSIC PLAYING ON TV] Rita? I don't know if you're feeling well enough to come down and join us for dinner, but, um, we have a guest. I'd really love for you to meet her. If you think you can leave your room today. If not, it's totally okay. I... We'll bring up dinner later. [THE CRIMSON LADY ON TV] Let me go. [JOHN ON TV] No! You were the one that invited me here. [THE CRIMSON LADY] I wanted to give you the respect - you deserve by ending this in person. - [LIQUID SLOSHING] [JOHN] Since when is respect something you give? Break the rules the world set. Define love the way you want to. [THE CRIMSON LADY] It won't work between us, John. We're too different, you and I. - It doesn't matter how different we are. - Let go! No! We both feel it... and that's all there is. [LIQUID CONTINUES SLOSHING] [JOHN] You are cruel. [THE CRIMSON LADY] Not as cruel as you'd have me be. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [LARRY] All right, then. Let's eat. [LARRY] For God's sake, Cliff, stop staring at the poor girl. So, are the waffles crispy on the outside and gooey a little bit on the inside with just the right amount of butter? They're perfect. Yeah. Try the chicken. [STAMMERS] What's that taste like? Crunchy and moist. Oh, God! I used to love fried chicken. I loved to eat, swim, loved to dance. I used to love dancing. Why can't you dance? Oh, forget it. You're young. Nobody's dancing with this. I would. [HUMS RHYTHMICALLY] [LARRY LAUGHS] She can stay. Sounds like everyone's having fun. I'm so sorry I'm late. - [LARRY] Oh, Rita. - I was putting myself together. You know, it takes some time. [SIGHS] Hmm. I hear we have a guest from the outside. How wonderful. I'm Rita. Rachel. Delighted. I'm famished. [RITA] Thank you. My condition requires a particularly high caloric intake. Can you pass the gravy, please? [RITA] Thank you. [RITA] Mmm. Mmm. Well, this is absolutely delicious, Larry. [LARRY] Someone kiss the cook. - [LAUGHING] - [LARRY] Seriously. Anyone... I'll take it from anyone. - Anybody? - [ALL LAUGHING] [LARRY] All right, no takers. All right. [CHUCKLING] [FLESH SQUELCHING] Are you okay? Uh... - [LARRY] Rita? - [RITA] I... [VOICE DISTORTING] I should have stayed in bed. Help! [LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY] Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Somebody... [RACHEL] It's okay. I'm not afraid of you. [RITA EXHALES] [DOOR OPENS] [CHIEF] Who is this? Chief. Uh, I can explain. Later. I have a new patient. - [MONITOR BEEPING] - [CLIFF] Who is she? Her name is Shyleen Lao. Cliff, the O2, stat. Close. Rita, run the IV. Gar, my case. Okay. Larry, any time. [LARRY] Oh, she's hot. Even for me. [RITA] What happened to her? A protest she organized turned violent. A nearby tanker exploded. She was engulfed in liquid nitrogen. The doctors treating her said there was nothing they could do. But she's a good soul, one worth saving. Poor thing. This serum should help stabilize her body temperature. Mmm-hmm. There, I think. [MONITOR FLATLINES] What the fuck? [LARRY] Chief? [GAR] What's happening? - Her body is reacting to my serum. - [SHYLEEN GASPING] [RITA] It's freezing in here. She is altering the temperature around us. We need to keep her warm. Blankets! [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] [CLIFF] Hey, uh, does anyone speak whatever that is? [LARRY] Hey, hey. You're okay. Deep breath. - Just breathe, okay? - [SHYLEEN GASPING] [SHYLEEN SOBBING] [RACHEL] I can help ease your pain. I know you're frightened. [DISTORTED VOICE] It's okay. It's okay. [SHYLEEN BREATHING SHAKILY] [AIR HISSING] [CHIEF SIGHS] Get sedation. [CLIFF] And she's stable. She needs to rest. [CHIEF] You are risking everything bringing someone here. It could destroy this family. Is that what you want? No, sir. I have only asked for one thing from you over the years. What is it? To trust you. I'm very disappointed in you, Garfield. Cliff, Larry, and Rita, they cannot go where you can. If we get discovered, they will end up locked away, like Rita once was. Experimented on, tortured. You are an incredibly selfish boy. Never disobey me again. Yes, sir. [SIGHS] Garfield, I'm sorry I had to be so stern. You know how much I care about you and the others, don't you? [SIGHS] Good. Now, tell me. When this girl touched our new patient, she healed her. What else is she capable of? I can help her, Garfield. Tell me. Did you hear about the explosion at the convent? [DOG BARKING] What do you want? Need to talk to you about the girl you saw in the forest. What? Did she say anything? Did you see where she went? You know, I already talked to the cops, so you can fuck off. Hey! You can't do that! I'm gonna need you to answer my questions. You better back off! Did you see where the girl went? [MAN PANTING] Answer me! - You're a psycho! - [GRUNTS] Did you hurt her? Did you touch her? [GRUNTS] Did you touch her? Did you hurt her? [KORY] Dick. Dick! Dick, stop! Daddy? Daddy! I would never hurt no girl. No kid. The only place out there is the old Caulder house. - Where? - It's out on Danny Street. But it's all locked up. Ain't no one there. Sorry. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Fuck you. It's okay. It's okay. [RACHEL] I didn't mean to be any trouble. - I'm sorry. - [CHIEF] Don't be sorry. You helped us save that young woman's life, and we are very grateful for it. You were a surprise to me. That's all. [CLIFF] I tried to warn the kid. Well, we keep what we're doing here very secret, you see? And what is it that you do here? I help people that others have given up on. I go beyond what medical science is willing to do... because I believe in hope. Don't you? Our dear Rita had been in an institution for decades after a toxic gas left her cells unstable. I freed her. And I'm very thankful, Chief. Then Larry. A pilot in the Air Force, he crashed his plane and was exposed to negative energy. He was given mere days to live. That was over 50 years ago. Cliff's story you already know. And finally, Garfield. [GAR CHUCKLES SOFTLY] He cured me. From what? [CHIEF] A rare disease he contracted from an even rarer species of primate in the Congo basin. Although, the cure I administered had unforeseen side effects. Chief thinks that I can unzip my DNA and rearrange it. It took me a while to figure it out, but... So that's how you can... But why a... I don't know. He thinks it's psychological. Tigers have always been my favorite. Ever since I was a kid. So, you all just live here? This isn't simply a sanctuary, Rachel. It's an incubation chamber, an experiment. The work I do on them will push medical science forward decades in a matter of years. What's happening here will one day save thousands, even millions, of lives. I think I can help you, too, Rachel. You... You can't help me. That's what they said about Cliff, Larry, Rita, and Garfield. That I couldn't. That they were doomed. And yet, here they all sit, enjoying dessert. If you'd let me examine you, do some tests... [RACHEL SIGHS] Rachel, you're not alone. I didn't know you had it in you. What? The way you attacked that man. It's none of my business, but if you don't unbury whatever it is that's going on, you're gonna explode. Just like her. You were a shrink in your past life? Maybe. Maybe I'm a shrink in this life. Who knows? You got problems. You seem like a nice guy, but I'm not so sure. I went through something when I was a kid. So, this is all about you? I don't want her to make the same mistakes I did. Trusting in the wrong people. You may have gone through some bad shit. I may have, too. I don't know. But what I do know is that no one manages alone. I don't have to remember much to rember that. [RACHEL] Does it have to be so tight? Yes. This ability you possess is likely tied to your nervous system. Trying to analyze it could trigger some physical movements. I don't want you getting hurt. Chief, are you sure about this? This is a relatively simple procedure, given what I've dealt with before. Bring me my case. Why? What are you gonna do? You are here to assist me, Garfield, not to question me. Understood? - Yeah, but I... - Do what I ask. For her. Please? Thank you, my boy. I can remove whatever's inside you. [RACHEL] No. No, wait, wait. I don't wanna do this anymore. This is for your own good, my child. I promise you. Let me up. Please. Gar... please. Let me up. Sit down, Garfield. Sit back down. No. "No"? She doesn't want to do this anymore. I've gotta unstrap her. Leave this room. Now. Chief... let her go. [GROWLING] [ROARS] I mean it. Gar! He'll be all right. You hurt him. [DEMONIC VOICE] You hurt my friend. [GROANS] Now, I'll hurt you. [STATIC CRACKLING] [LOW GROWLING] Fascinating. [DICK] Hello? [GASPS] [SCREAMING] [SOFTLY] Get out. Get out! [CHIEF CONTINUES SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Rachel. Go. [LARRY] Don't make me fight you. You don't wanna see what I really am. Same. Rachel! [DISTORTED SCREAMING] Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Hey. [DEMONIC VOICE] You're going to die. Get out of here, before it's too late. I'm not going anywhere. I don't wanna hurt you. Listen, I was wrong. When I told you no one can help you. Dick, you need to leave. Please. At the church, when I said you're on your own. Okay, I was wrong. You're not on your own. Okay? You have me. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere, okay? I'm not going anywhere. Here I am. [SOBBING] [DICK] I'm right here. It's okay. [CLIFF] Go. Go with them. Go have a life. But the Chief. [LARRY] His back is broken again. We'll take care of him. He helped us, Gar. No matter what, we owe it to Chief to help him now. Um, maybe you guys can come. I mean, you don't have to hide anymore. [CLIFF] It is what it is, kid. But you... [SNIFFLES] You can have more than us. [CLIFF] All right. Now get going, will ya? Green fool. Rachel, get in the car.
