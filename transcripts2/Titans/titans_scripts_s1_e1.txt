 It's okay. Everything's gonna be okay. Okay? Sweetie, you need to get a little more rest. Come on. Everything is gonna be okay. Mom? Yeah. Keep the door locked.

 It's a pleasure. I read your file. You seem to know what you're doing. You keep doing your thing, I'll keep doing my thing. We'll be good. Don't take it personally. I need a breath mint or something? He's been pushing off getting a partner since he got here a month ago. Some shit about his last one or something. He's from Gotham. Likes to work alone. Gotham? Jesus... What happened to his last partner? Gassed by The Joker. Who knows? Did you have breakfast? You shouldn't drink coffee. You shouldn't smoke. I quit. No, you didn't. Well, I'm going to. Darn it. I forgot to get cream. You forgot to get everything. Okay. I'm late. Can you take the bus to school again today? Sure. Okay. You never sleep anymore. No, not often. It's because you're scared of me. I am not scared of you, honey. I can tell when you're lying. I can feel it. You know I can. Pray with me. No, no. Talk with me. What's inside of me? What is it? Rachel, just please pray with me. Please! - Our father who art in... - No more praying. No more lying. Tell me what you're not, Mom! Tell me! I'm sorry, Mama. It's okay, baby! - Rachel! - I'm gonna miss the bus. Rachel! Hey, kid. You tell your mother that screaming keeps us up all hours of the night, I'm calling the police again. You hear me? I don't care about your emotional issues! Weirdo. Boo! Come on. What are you hiding from? You don't have to be shy with me. I like freaks. Leave her alone, Kyle. Don't you have a touchdown or something to throw, Matt? Just leave her alone, asshole. Before I make you. Maybe you should take a seat. Knock him out! Sit back down! Both of you! Now! Come on. It was getting good. - Does it hurt? - It doesn't hurt. Slut. Slut! Uh, Matt. Thanks for... Mom? Mom, I am really sorry about this morning. Rachel. That's what she calls you. But that is not who you are. Let my mom go. This woman is not your mother. Tell her. Tell her! I am not your mother. - But I do love you. - No. You have good inside your heart, sweetheart. Don't do... There. Now, that's better. Pink? The kids love it. What was that? I'm only here for Tyler Hackett. Leave the drugs. Leave the guns. And walk away. Where's Batman? He could be anywhere, man. He's up there somewhere. Look up. Look up. Oh, where's the Bat! Where is he? Hey. The little birdie's alone. Get him! Tyler! Where you going, man? If you ever touch your kid again, I will find you. Fuck Batman. Are you guys sure it's him? Absolutely, Captain. We called Gotham P.D. He hasn't been seen for over a year. Disappeared, they said. They thought he might be dead. Why come here? Why Detroit? The weather? Let's just hope to hell he's just passing through. You know the problems that these masks bring with 'em. Painted freaks. Psychopaths in drag. We don't need that shit. We got enough of our own regular problems here. Come on, guys. Back to work. I need to talk to you for a second, Eddie. Sure, Captain. Where to? Detroit. One way, please. I'll give your compliments to the chef. My name is Sally. I work here. First, I don't need to know who you are, or how you got here, okay? What I really care about is keeping girls your age off the streets. Or out of the adult shelters which aren't much better. There's a youth shelter, a few blocks from here. They'll have a bed for you. No questions asked. Shortcut. I grew up here, me and this city. I've lived here since I was your age. On the streets, too. Shelters saved my life. Lies! She's lying. Look behind you. Hey, come on. I've been where you are. You feel like you can't trust anyone. What's wrong, sugar? I was just gonna give you a ride. Come on. It's okay. Run! Rachel! Rachel! Wait! Wait! Stop! Let's go, kid. Hey, uh, any luck on that Robin thing? Wait, are you talking to me? Is everybody else dead? Because I clearly must be the last person on Earth for that to happen. I guess I haven't been the most welcoming. Hey, Grayson. You got that thing for helping kids, right? Hi, there. How you doing? Word on the street is you like playing baseball with bricks and cop cars. I am Detective Dick Grayson. You wanna talk about what happened? It's you. - I'm not sure if you... - You're the boy from the circus. Please. Can you help me? _ Kory Anders. Kory Anders. Kory Anders. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Hello? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Hmm? Hmm? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Who are you? Is this some kind of sick practical joke? I remember. People were happy that night. What the hell is this? You, most of all. Your parents... I watched them fall. You kept wishing it was a dream. Wishing you would wake up. Who put you up to this? Everything led me here. To you. It can't be by accident. You've got to help me. I don't know how... You want help? So you throw a brick at a cop car? You don't understand... - Okay, make me understand. - Someone killed my mom! Okay. Name, address. She was all I had. The only person in the world who cared for me. I am alone now. I want to help you. Listen, I'm gonna check this out, okay? Don't leave me here. Rachel, you vandalized a police car. - You're not going anywhere. - You don't understand. You need to lock me up. Please. There is something inside of me. Something evil. I can't give you the kind of help you need. I will find someone who can. Don't leave me here. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. Hey, so, she's saying her mom was killed. If you could send someone down there, that'll be great. Okay, I'll call you if anything checks out. - Thanks. - It's probably bullshit though. Kids down there livin' on the street stealing... - The Mayor has... - They'll say anything to get out of trouble. ...released a warrant demanding the crime fighting vigilante known as Robin... Yeah, I know. ...to leave Detroit immediately. Quote. "This is a violent sociopath." End quote. Hey, can I ask you something? I'm kind of in the middle of something. So, what? You and your sidekick go bad? I'm sorry? Your partner at Gotham P.D. I mean, I'm no mind reader, it just seems kinda obvious. I guess we had different ideas of how to do the job. How's that? He on the take? I heard most of Gotham is. No, not him. He was a hero to a lot of people. Including me. A stop-at-nothing guy who solved everything with his fists. I admired him at first, what he did... Or was trying to do. But eventually, I had to walk away. Why? Because I was becoming too much like him. So, you're not really, huh? What? An asshole. Don't tell. It will kill my rep. Yeah. Well, your secret's safe with me. Hey, there. We're gonna transfer you. We'll be putting you in with the other kids. It will be safer for you there. It's okay. Bring your bag. Right this way. Grayson. This is Officer Jones. Traverse City P.D. - Mm-hmm. - Girl you called in about, Rachel Roth? We found her mother. Gunshot to the head. Looks like a homicide. I'll have our C.S.I send you the details as we get them. Okay, thanks. Let me kill him! Let me kill him now! Detective Grayson. Can I get a 10-20 on the car number 310? My dear... I was worried for you. Who are you, exactly? Who am I? Who the hell are you? And who do you work for? Uh, I don't... I don't know. I... You come here, you sit at my side, you sleep in my bed! I trusted you! And you turn on me? You betray me? Because of this girl? Who is she? What do you want with her? I don't know. I woke up in a car. And these men were trying to kill me... I loved you. Oh... I don't think I loved you too. Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's a no. Wait! Rachel Roth. You've always known you were different, haven't you? That you have a destiny. Please... I have been looking for you for so long. Let me go. Nothing resembles itself tonight. This dirty room is a church. I appear the villain but in truth, I am the savior. You... You pose as the innocent, but deep inside... You know you're fecund and damned. You have the skin of the lamb. The sheath by which he will penetrate this world, and seed its destruction. But alas, you are the doorway he would walk through upright to put out our sun, and I... Cannot allow that to happen. I have to save us all. I will lay your heart beside the heart of a beast. And beside the heart of a simpleton. And burn them all. And the doorway will be closed forever. Don't hurt me! Rachel! Help! Help! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel. Rachel, open the door! Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Open the door! Rachel! What happened? I don't know! Please help me! This is yours? Family heirloom. From the circus? Not the one you're thinking. Come on, let's go. Where are we going? Somewhere safe. My mom says there's no such thing as monsters. I think she was wrong. Okay. Rad.
