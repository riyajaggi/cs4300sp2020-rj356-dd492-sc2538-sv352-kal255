WELCOME TO SKIN WARS. - AFTER ALAN GOING HOME, EVERYTHING IS REAL. EVERYTHING'S A COMPETITION. YOU NEVER KNOW WHO IS GOING HOME. - I SEE A PLATTER, AND I'M THINKING MAYBE WE'LL HAVE TO PAINT SOMETHING ON SOME FOOD OR SOMETHING, OR MAYBE IT'S LUNCHTIME AGAIN. - HELLO, PAINTERS. all: HI. - SAY HI TO RU AND ROBIN.

 THEY WILL BE JUDGING THE FIRST CHALLENGE TODAY. - NICE. - HELLO. - NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY ALL LOOKING AT THESE TABLES, AND THINKING WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE A NICE, COZY MEAL TOGETHER. DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE. YOU'RE NOT HERE TO DINE. THERE ARE NINE TABLES HERE THAT REPRESENT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND WILL BE YOUR INSPIRATION. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING MISSING... A CENTERPIECE, TO MAKE THESE TABLES STAND OUT. YOU WILL CREATE A CENTERPIECE THAT WILL BE INSPIRED BY THE COUNTRY REPRESENTED ON THE TABLES. YOU HAVE TWO HOURS TO COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE. THE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOU. YOU CAN GO TO YOUR WORK STATIONS. NOW, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR CANVAS. PAINTERS, LIFT UP YOUR DOMES. - HELLO. - [screams] JESUS! [laughter] - AAH! - AAH! - OH, MY GOD. - AH! THERE IS A FREAKING BALD HEAD IN THE MIDDLE OF MY WORK STATION. [laughter] - WHAT THE HELL? - SAY HELLO TO YOUR MODELS! [laughter] - WHAT'S UP, DUDE? [laughs] - YOUR TIME STARTS RIGHT... NOW. - TODAY'S CHALLENGE IS TO COME UP WITH A CENTERPIECE THAT WOULD EXIST ON A TABLE SETTING IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY. - WHAT AM I GOING TO PAINT ON YOU? - I REALLY LUCKED OUT WITH FRANCE. - I JUST GOT BACK FROM MEXICO. I THINK I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE. - MY GRANDMOTHER MET MY GRANDFATHER. HE WAS STATIONED IN SOUTH KOREA. - I LOVE COLOR, AND WHAT ELSE DOES JAMAICA HAVE, BUT COLOR? I'M GOING TO DO A LITTLE MUSICAL REGGAE PLAYER RIGHT ON HER NOSE, SO WHEN SHE MOVES HER NOSE AND HER MOUTH, IT ANIMATES. NOBODY'S EVEN THOUGHT OF SOMETHING ON THIS LEVEL. [chuckles] - YOU KNOW, A SIMPLE WINE, FOOD BISTRO. I REALLY LUCKED OUT GETTING FRANCE, BECAUSE I KNOW ABOUT FRANCE. I MEAN, EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT FRANCE. I WANT TO USE THE BACK FOR, LIKE, THE SCENE. I'M GONNA MAKE THIS A ROMANTIC VIEW FROM THE TABLE AT THE EIFFEL TOWER WITH TWO WINE GLASSES CLINKING IN THE BACK. LOVE IS IN THE FRENCH AIR. - I GOT TO GET GOING. I HAVE MEXICO. WHEN I THINK OF A CENTERPIECE FOR A TABLE, I'M THINKING SUGAR SKULL, DIA DE LOS MUERTOS. IN ORDER TO WIN THIS CHALLENGE, I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO SOMETHING UNIQUE TO SET MYSELF APART. BEDAZZLED HEAD IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. - LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AT THE SOUND OF THE BEEP, WE WILL HAVE ONE HOUR. BEEP. - TODAY IS THE DAY TO WIN THE ADVANTAGE. THESE MINI-CHALLENGES ARE SUPER IMPORTANT TO ME. IF YOU'RE GIVEN AN ADVANTAGE AS A PRIZE, YOU USE IT IN THE NEXT ELIMINATION CHALLENGE. LOVE IT. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT. - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. I HAVE SOUTH KOREA. MY GRANDFATHER HAD THESE KOREAN WEDDING DOLLS. THEY'RE VERY, VERY PLAIN. FOR BEING THE CENTERPIECE, YOUR EYES WILL BE CLOSED. - OKAY. - I'M TAKING A HUGE RISK BY GOING VERY SIMPLE. - THE COUNTRY THAT I HAVE IS BRAZIL. WHAT I'M DOING IS USING A COMBINATION OF THE PAINT AND THE FOAM TO CREATE THIS LIVE IGUANA, LIKE IT'S ON THE SIDE OF HIS FACE, AND THE REST OF HIS HEAD HAS GOT THIS, LIKE, DENSE JUNGLE SCENERY IN THE BACKGROUND. - THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT THAT JUST SCREAMS SWITZERLAND THAT WOULD BE ON A TABLE. I'M MULLING IT OVER, AND THEN I'M THINKING SNOW GLOBE. I THINK IT'S BRILLIANT, AND I GOT THIS IN THE BAG. - UH, TEN MORE MINUTES, GUYS. HURRY, HURRY, HURRY, HURRY. - FIVE MINUTES. - WHAT? OKAY. I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME, AND I REALIZE I CAN STRUGGLE WITH THIS FLAG, OR I CAN BUST OUT THE REST. - DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES. DON'T OPEN YOUR EYES. [sighs] THAT IS...OH. EVERY TIME YOU OPEN YOUR EYES, YOU'LL CRACK THE PAINT ON YOUR EYES. I WAS DONE, AND NOW I HAVE TO REPAINT HIS EYELIDS QUICKLY AND WELL. TRY NOT TO BLINK WHEN I DO THAT. YOU JUST KEEP THOSE EYES SHUT. - ALL RIGHT, GET ON IT. GET ON IT. - OH, MY GOD. - TIME IS UP, PAINTERS. PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. - HOLY MACKEREL, THAT WAS INSANE! - JUDGES, LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. - OKAY. - HELLO. - WOW, JAMAICA. - JAMAICA. [reggae music] ♪ ♪ - IT TOOK ME A MINUTE TO GET IT. IT'S A REALLY CLEVER IDEA. - THANK YOU. - I AM MISSING A LITTLE BIT OF THE DETAIL ON THE BACK. - DID YOU HAVE ENOUGH TIME? - I SHOULD'VE HAD ENOUGH TIME. I-I'M STARTING TO THINK I'M NOT PAINTING FAST ENOUGH. I WAS ALMOST THERE. - THANKS, SEAN. I LOVE THE SKI LIFT HERE. - I SEE DUTCH USED SOME GLITTER IN HIS CENTERPIECE, SO MAYBE HE'S LEARNING A THING OR TWO FROM ME. - THE TRAIN ON THE FRONT... - YEAH! - YOU REALLY PUSHED US BACK IN SPACE AS WE LOOK AT IT. - HERE WE ARE, DEEP IN THE JUNGLE OF BRAZIL. - THAT IS AMAZING. - OH, WOW. OKAY, WE GOT THE WOLF FROM, LIKE, RUSSIAN FAIRY TALES. - I KNOW SOME--MM-HMM. - THERE'S MORE ON THE BACK. THE USE OF PROPS IS SO FUNNY. - UH-HUH. - BONJOUR. - [laughs] - OH, THAT'S THE PYRAMID AT THE LOUVRE. - SO, MOTOWN DOES INDIA. - [laughs] - I'M MORE CAPTIVATED BY THIS IMAGE THAN I AM BY THE FRONT IMAGE. DAY OF THE DEAD, RIGHT? - YES, UH-HUH. - SEE, I KNOW. - [laughs] - SO WHAT IS ORIGINAL ABOUT YOUR SUGAR SKULL? - WE'VE GOT SOME PIZZAZZ. WE'VE GOT GLITTER. WE'VE GOT JEWELS. I REALLY WANTED AN EYE-CATCHING CENTERPIECE. - IT MAKES SO MUCH SENSE THAT YOU WOULD DO A SUGAR SKULL. IT'S FOOD. IT'S A TABLE. VERY SMART! - HI, MYTHICA. - HELLO. - I'M STARING AT THIS, BUT I'M ALSO STARING AT THIS. - I GOT AN ASS-WHUPPING EARLIER, SO I FIGURED IF I'M GOING TO BATTLE, I'M GONNA DRESS FOR IT. - OKAY. - DID YOU USE THESE FANS AS YOUR STENCIL, MYTHICA? - I DID. - THAT'S VERY CLEVER, AND...CREATIVE. - THANK YOU. - WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? - WELL, LET'S START WITH DUTCH. - HE NAILED THAT PERSPECTIVE... - YEAH. - ON THE TRAIN AND THE SKI LIFT. - DUTCH WAS EXQUISITE. I'M JUST NOT SO SURE ABOUT A SNOW GLOBE AS THE CENTERPIECE. - I THINK FELLE, ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD, KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK. YOU KNOW, I WASN'T SO CONVINCED BY THE FRONT. I-I DON'T THINK THAT ELEPHANT WAS VERY STRONG. - AND WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT NICOLE'S? - FABULOUS, THE SUGAR SKULL IS PERFECT FOR A DINNER TABLE SITUATION. - THE MINUTE I WALKED IN, MY EYE WENT, BOOM, STRAIGHT TO HERS. - MYTHICA SURPRISED ME THIS TIME. SHE HAS REALLY REDEEMED HERSELF. - SHE USED THE FANS AS A STENCIL. I MEAN, THAT WAS REALLY THINKING OUT OF THE BOX. - SO DO YOU THINK YOU'VE MADE YOUR DECISION? - YEAH, I THINK SO. - YEAH. - PAINTERS, THE JUDGES HAVE PICKED THE TOP THREE CENTERPIECES: DUTCH... NICOLE... MYTHICA. - AH! I AM IN SHOCK. I DIDN'T THINK THAT I WAS GONNA BE IN THE TOP THREE, AND HERE I AM. I'M LIKE...[gasps] - DUTCH, YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL, IT'S NOTHING SHORT OF AMAZING. - SAY IT AGAIN. - [laughs] - NICOLE, YOUR PIECE WAS SO YUMMY THAT I WANTED TO EAT IT. - YES! - MYTHICA. MAMA, YOU CAME THROUGH. SO PROUD OF YOU. - THANK YOU. - PAINTERS, IT'S TIME FOR THE JUDGES TO PICK OUT THE CENTERPIECE THAT STANDS OUT THE MOST. - I'VE GOT A VERY STRONG FEELING THAT I'M A CANDIDATE TO WIN THIS PARTICULAR MINI-CHALLENGE. - DUTCH HAS DONE THIS AMAZING TRAIN COMING ACROSS THE FACE, BUT MY CENTERPIECE BELONGS ON A TABLE MORE THAN DUTCH'S CENTERPIECE. - THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... - PAINTERS, IT'S TIME FOR THE JUDGES TO PICK OUT THE CENTERPIECE THAT STANDS OUT THE MOST. THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... NICOLE. [applause] CONGRATULATIONS. - CONGRATULATIONS. - WHEN I HAVE MY MEXICAN FIESTA, IT'S YOUR PIECE THAT I WANT. - THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. I'M SO EXCITED. - NICOLE, YOU JUST WON A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR THE NEXT CHALLENGE. - [laughing] YES! THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. WINNING OVER DUTCH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. TO BEAT SOMEONE THAT AMAZING JUST FELT SO GOOD. - WELL, I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL CURIOUS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEXT CHALLENGE. - YES. - YES, DEFINITELY. - WELL...YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW TO FIND OUT THE DETAILS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS. all: AWW. BOO! - MEAN! - WE HAVE SOMETHING AMAZING IN STORE FOR YOU. - OH, COME ON. - BYE. THAT'S IT. - WHAT A TEASE. - YEAH, I KNOW. [indistinct chatter] - OH, MY GOD. - I DON'T THINK THAT NICOLE HAD THE STRONGEST PIECE IN THAT CHALLENGE. I THINK I SHOULD'VE GOTTEN THE WIN ON THIS ONE. - OH, MY GOSH, I'M SO EXCITED. - LET'S GO GET COFFEE. - SO THAT WAS A FUN CHALLENGE, RIGHT, GUYS? - YEAH. - THAT WAS CRAZY. - REALLY? - THAT'S JUST THE WAY I FEEL. - YOUR PIECE WAS, LIKE, A-PLUS ONE SIDE, AND C-MINUS OTHER SIDE. - DUTCH DOES A LOT OF TALKING, AND HE SPEAKS WITH CONFIDENCE, AND SOMETIMES IT MAKES OTHER PEOPLE FEEL STUPID. - PEOPLE WERE DOING STUFF THAT DID NOT LOOK LIKE IT BELONGED ON A TABLE. - THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING AN OPINION, AND BEING, LIKE, A JUST, STRAIGHT-UP [bleep]. - WOW. - HELLO, PAINTERS. all: HELLO. - WE HAVE A VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE FOR THIS CHALLENGE. SHE IS INTERNATIONALLY RENOWNED ARTIST EMMA CAMMACK. [all cheering] - YAY, EMMA! EMMA HAS BEEN AN IDOL OF MINE SINCE I GOT INTO BODY PAINTING, AND I'M KIND OF STAR-STRUCK, AND I PROBABLY HAVE A REALLY STUPID LOOK ON MY FACE LIKE THIS. - REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU WE HAD SOMETHING AMAZING IN STORE FOR YOU? WELL, HERE WE ARE. - [laughs] OH, THERE-- THERE YOU GO. - THAT'S RIGHT. SEE WHAT I DID THERE? MM-HM. - HUH. - FOR YOUR FIRST CHALLENGE, WE PUT YOU TO THE TEST AND ASKED YOU TO MAKE YOUR MODELS STAND OUT AS THE CENTERPIECE OF YOUR TABLE. NOW IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO DO THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE. IN THIS CONCEPT CHALLENGE, YOU MUST CREATE A BODY PAINTING THAT WILL MAKE YOUR MODELS DISAPPEAR INTO THE VERY AISLES OF THIS SUPERMARKET. YOU WILL HAVE FIVE HOURS TO COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE. - CAMOUFLAGE AT A GROCERY STORE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY. - EMMA IS THE MASTER OF THIS BLENDING TECHNIQUE, AND HER WORK HAS BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE BRITISH ROYAL FAMILY, ELTON JOHN, STING, AND CIRQUE DU SOLEIL. - I FREAK OUT, BECAUSE EMMA'S KNOWN FOR HER AMAZING CAMOUFLAGE PIECES. - I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT YOU GUYS DO TODAY, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE HARD. - THERE'S A LOT OF PRESSURE ON ME TO WIN THIS CHALLENGE, BECAUSE CAMO'S MY THING. I THINK THE JUDGES EXPECT MORE FROM ME THAN PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER CAMOUFLAGED BEFORE. - EMMA, WHAT IS THE KEY TO CREATING THAT ILLUSION IN WHICH THE MODEL IS LOST WITHIN THE IMAGE BEHIND THEM? - IT'S REALLY ABOUT FINDING THE FOCAL POINT THAT THE IMAGE IS TAKEN FROM, SO WE'LL HAVE CAMERAS THAT WILL GIVE THAT POINT OF VIEW, AND THEN THE PAINTERS WILL HAVE TO KEEP REFERRING BACK IN CAMERA, SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHAT THE IMAGE ITSELF WILL LOOK LIKE. OTHERWISE, THEY'RE JUST NOT GONNA VANISH. - NICOLE, SINCE YOU WON THE FIRST CHALLENGE, YOU WILL HAVE FIRST CHOICE OF YOUR BACKGROUND IN THE STORE. - YES. YES! - AWW! - THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EVER DOING A CAMOUFLAGE BODY PAINT PIECE. THANK GOD THAT I GET AN ADVANTAGE. - THE REST OF YOU WILL CHOOSE YOUR BACKGROUNDS WHEN I START THE CHALLENGE. BEST OF LUCK TO ALL OF YOU. NICOLE, YOU CAN GO IN AND CHOOSE YOUR BACKGROUND NOW. - YES! I SEE THE CANDY SHELF. DON'T SHOW ME THAT SHELF AND NOT EXPECT ME TO PICK IT. - THE REST OF YOU, YOUR TIME STARTS...NOW! GO, GO, GO, FIND YOUR SPOT! - LORD, I DON'T WANT THAT. - WOO-HOO! - I'M USED TO PAINTING AFRICAN-AMERICAN PEOPLE, SO I'M LOOKING FOR A SPACE WHERE I CAN USE THOSE BROWN TONES. - HEY, FELLE, THERE'S ONE OVER HERE. - WHERE? - RIGHT HERE. - THAT'S WHERE I WANT IT. - GET IT, GET IT! - IT'S MONOCHROMATIC, AND I'M TAKING A GAMBLE. - AH! I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M GOING! - I SEE THE SUPER COLORFUL SODA BOTTLES. THIS COULD BE FUN. WHOO! - ANGELA COMES OUT OF NOWHERE. - WHOO! - SHE NEARLY KNOCKS ME FLYING INTO THE CHEESE. WHERE IS ANYTHING? I START TO PANIC, AND I SEE CEREAL. DA! - EVERYONE, I THINK, IS AT THEIR SPOTS... - OH, YEAH. - BUT ANGELA'S WALKING UP AND DOWN THE AISLES. THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE, ANGELA, THE WINE SECTION. - OH, HELL, NO. [laughter] ARE YOU SERIOUS, THE WINE BOTTLES? THAT'S THE HARDEST BACKGROUND. I FAILED. - I'M LOOKING AT ANGELA, SHE'S FREAKING OUT. ANGELA, YOU WANT TO DO THIS ONE? I'LL DO IT. I'LL DO IT. - BUT... - I DON'T MIND. - AHH! [laughs] NATALIE IS A DOLL. AW, I LOVE YOU. - SURE. I LOOK AT THE WINE, AND I'M FREAKING OUT, BECAUSE OF ALL OF THOSE DARK, DARK COLORS, AND THE WHITE, WHITE HIGHLIGHTS. I DIDN'T DO IT TO LOOK LIKE A FREAKING HERO. I DID IT BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, THAT'S GONNA BE THE HARDEST THING I EVER HAVE TO DO. LIZZIE! both: HEY. - LET'S GO DO THIS. [laughter] BAM, GOOD? - LET ME SEE YOU SIT UP HERE. NOPE, GO AHEAD AND STAND. NOPE, STAND RIGHT IN THERE. NOPE, OH, MY GOD. - PUT YOUR RIGHT LEG DOWN. LEAN FORWARD A LITTLE BIT. OKAY, LET'S SEE. I AM TAKING EVERY OUNCE OF ADRENALINE THAT I GOT OUT OF "OH, MY GOODNESS, I ALMOST WENT HOME," AND I'M GONNA CONVERT THAT INTO GO-GO JUICE, AND I'M JUST GOING TO RIP IT APART. ACTUALLY, THAT WAS PRETTY COOL. - I WANT ONE LEG HERE. - THAT'S GONNA BE REALLY DIFFICULT. [laughs] - ONE OF THE CRITERIAS WE'RE GETTING JUDGED ON IS CREATIVITY, AND WHEN YOU'RE CAMOUFLAGING, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF CREATIVITY, EXCEPT FOR YOUR POSE. - I LOOK OVER AT NATALIE. HER POSE IS REALLY RISKY, BECAUSE REALIGNING HER IS GONNA BE REALLY, REALLY TOUGH. HERE, AND I'M GONNA HAVE YOU JUST LEAN. - PERFECT, SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE THE SPOT. - IT'LL--IT'LL TAKE THE LOAD OFF YOU. AND, YEAH. - ABSOLUTELY. - I DECIDE NOT TO GO WITH A GIMMICKY POSE, SO I STAND HER VERTICAL. - WE GOT A PAINT SPILL ON AISLE FOUR. CAN WE GET A CLEANUP ON AISLE FOUR? THANK YOU. - SO I'M THINKING, LIKE, THE VIEWING RATIO IS GONNA BE RIGHT ABOUT HERE. - STRAIGHT AHEAD. - IF YOU'RE THE OWNER OF A BEIGE MINIVAN, YOUR LIGHTS ARE ON. - TURN YOUR HEAD TO THE RIGHT, PLEASE. WHAT WE SEE IN THIS MONITOR IS WHERE THE CAMERA'S EYE IS. THAT'S WHERE THE FINAL PHOTO WILL BE TAKEN THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE JUDGED ON. - GET BACK INTO A STRAIGHTER POSE. - THAT'S THE ONLY PERSPECTIVE THAT REALLY MATTERS. - TIMES LIKE THIS, I WISH MY MODEL WERE TRANSLUCENT. - [laughing] YEAH. THE SPOT THAT I PICKED, IT'S IN THE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. - THAT IS SO COOL. - RIGHT? [laughs] DO I PLAY IT SAFE? UH, YES AND NO. I DON'T GO BALLS-OUT CRAZY, BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER DONE CAMO BEFORE. BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYBODY SEE MY FULL DECK OF CARDS. - I REALLY WANT TO WOW SOME PEOPLE TODAY, 'CAUSE I CAN PAINT. WITH THE TIME BEING SUCH A FACTOR IN THESE CHALLENGES, I GOT TO MANAGE MY TIME. - RIGHT THERE, OKAY. I AM PANICKING, BECAUSE MY MODEL IS NOT BLENDING INTO MY SHELF. AS I LOOK OVER AT DUTCH, I NOTICE HE'S BRINGING HIS LINES ALL THE WAY ACROSS. SO, I WILL TRY THE SAME THING. AND MY MODEL BEGINS TO BLEND IN. THANK YOU, DUTCH. - I'M PAINTING, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, MY MODEL STARTS GETTING SICK. - NOT FEELING WELL? LET ME GET THE MEDIC OVER HERE, OKAY? - SHE SAYS SHE FEELS LIKE SHE'S GONNA THROW UP. - GUYS, I NEED A MEDIC ON SET, PLEASE. MEDIC, MEDIC? YOU GUYS, RUN. SOMEONE, RUN. - WELL, I'M STANDING. I'M NOT SITTING. - OH, YOU ARE? - YEAH. - FELLE'S MODEL IS NOT FEELING WELL HALFWAY THROUGH THE CHALLENGE. I'M STARTING TO GET REALLY WORRIED FOR HER. - WHEN MY MODEL STARTS GETTING SICK, I HAVE TO LAY HER DOWN, AND IT'S FRUSTRATING. I WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, I NEED HER FOR THE CHALLENGE, OR THIS MIGHT BE THE ONE WHERE I'M GOING HOME. - WE LOOK OVER AT FELLE'S MODEL, AND HIS MODEL'S LAYING ON THE FLOOR. IT'S SUPER IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR MODEL DURING A CAMOUFLAGE PAINTING, BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THE SAME POSE, AND THEY HAVE TO STAY RELATIVELY STILL. - YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE'S OKAY, BUT IT IS FRUSTRATING WHILE THE CLOCK IS TICKING. - I'D RATHER RECREATE THE--THE SISTINE CHAPEL CEILING. - [laughs] - THAT'S HOW BAD-- THAT'S HOW MUCH I DON'T LIKE THIS. I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M ON AUTO-PILOT RIGHT NOW. - MY MODEL IS AMAZING. SHE CONTINUES TO MOTIVATE ME. I THINK THAT'S FINE. - HOW YOU FEELING? YOU SURE? OKAY, YEAH. HONESTLY, I LOST SOME TIME FROM MY MODEL GETTING SICK. IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING, BUT I'M GLAD THAT SHE'S OKAY. YOU SURE? YOU'RE POSITIVE? - MM-HM. - THE CONCEPT FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE IS CAMOUFLAGE. - EMMA CAMMACK, HOW WOULD YOU DO THIS? - THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WITH DOING CAMO IS MAKING SURE THAT LINING THINGS UP FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE CAMERA IS SEAMLESS. - HELLO, NATALIE. - HI, GUYS. all: HI. - HOW'S YOUR MODEL FEELING WITH THIS WHOLE, LIKE, SHE'S GETTING ARRESTED POSE? - SO I DIDN'T WANT TO JUST DO... - INDEED. - YOU KNOW, JUST STANDING THERE. I WANTED HER TO, LIKE-- GRABBING A BOTTLE OF WINE. - SHE'S STILL SMILING. - SO YOU GOT THE ADVANTAGE OF CHOOSING WHICH SPACE. - I DID. - WHAT DREW YOU TO THIS? - THE CANDY, THE COLORS. I LOVE PINK. AND THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE THAT I COULD USE A LITTLE BIT OF GLITTER ON. [laughs] - WELL, TELL US ABOUT YOUR CHOICE OF LOCATION. - I LOVE FLOWERS, BUT I ALSO LIKE PUSHING AND PULLING DEPTH. - NICE. - AND SO I WANTED THAT SENSE OF BEING ABLE TO STICK YOUR HAND INTO IT. - ANGELA, HOW ARE YOU DOING? - HI. - SCARED [bleep]. - WHAT ARE YOU SCARED OF? - THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BLENDING A MODEL INTO A THREE-DIMENSIONAL BACKGROUND, SO I'M REALLY NERVOUS. - DO YOU HAVE A TACTIC YOU'RE GONNA USE FOR PAINTING THE LETTERING? - I'M NOT SURE. I'M REALLY SCARED RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M SO BEHIND. - HOW ARE YOU FEELING ON TIME? - I'M REALLY, REALLY OVERWHELMED. - OKAY. - I AM FREAKING OUT. - THIS ANGLE THAT YOU'RE ON... - YES. - YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THIS THROUGHOUT THE, UH, CHALLENGE? - OH, GREAT. GREAT. GREAT. - YEAH. I'M ALSO USING THE FACING RATIO OF THE CAMERA RIGHT NOW... - YEAH. - TO ACTUALLY STILL GUIDE ME, SO INSTEAD OF GETTING LOST NOODLING IN WHAT I THINK LOOKS GOOD FROM HERE... - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. - I'M KEEPING MINDFUL OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE MONITOR, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? SO... - THAT'S--THAT'S THE KEY. - BEAUTIFUL. - SO, WHEN YOU POSED HER, HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THE CHALLENGE THAT THE LETTERING MIGHT POSE? - I'M NOT ACTUALLY PAINTING THE LETTERS. - RIGHT. - I'M PAINTING WHAT I SEE HERE. - OH, THAT--THAT'S GOOD. - TELL ME HOW YOU'RE FEELING ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE LEFT. - I AM PANICKING. - OH, MAN. - ARE YOU REALLY? - YEAH, I KNOW THAT I CAN DO THIS, I'M JUST USED TO HAVING AS MUCH TIME AS I NEED, SO I'M HOPING I GET THERE. - WELL, CARRY ON, SIR. - THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GUYS. - THANK YOU, SEAN. - THANK YOU. - THAT'S ALMOST RIGHT. - HAS ANYBODY SEEN MY MODEL? - [laughs] NOPE. - SHE DISAPPEARED. - I DON'T HAVE ANY COLORS THAT ARE DEAD-ON. - AH. - I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH COLORS MATCHING. - 80%, AND THEN 20. - OH, CRAP. - NO, NO, A LITTLE MORE. OKAY, STOP, GO. - ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. - ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GOOD. YOU'RE GOOD. YEAH, YEAH. - THE ONE COLOR THAT I KNOW THAT DOES MATCH ARE THOSE YELLOW FLOWERS, SO I'M GONNA CONNECT THESE FLOWERS HERE TO THESE FLOWERS DOWN HERE. OKAY, I SPENT TOO LONG THERE, AND NOW I NEED TO HURRY UP. - THIS IS SO HARD. I POSE MY MODEL IN A SUPER AMBITIOUS POSE, BECAUSE I JUST WON THE LAST CONCEPT CHALLENGE. THIS ONE NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO ME. I KNOW THAT ALL THE OTHER ARTISTS ARE NOW LOOKING AT ME AS A THREAT. I'LL MAKE IT LOOK GOOD. - ATTENTION, YOU HAVE 15 MINUTES LEFT. - WHAT? - [laughing] WHAT? - I'M MOST WORRIED ABOUT THE--THE LITTLE, TINY DETAILS ON THE LABELS. WINE HAS THE SMALLEST, LIKE, "2011," YOU KNOW, THAT YOU'VE EVER SEEN, SO IT CAN BE WICKED HARD, BUT... - I LOOK OVER AT NATALIE, AND I'M FAIRLY IMPRESSED. SHE ACTUALLY REALLY KNOWS HOW TO PAINT. SHE'S DEFINITELY ON MY RADAR. - FIVE MINUTES, EVERYBODY. - WHAT? - OH, MY GOD. [groans] - LIFT YOUR WHOLE BODY JUST A HAIR, LIKE--YEAH. DON'T MOVE. - THAT LOOKS BETTER. OKAY. - AH, NICE, NICE, NICE, OKAY. - ALL RIGHT, SWEET. FOR MY FIRST TIME DOING CAMO ON A BODY, I THINK I DID PRETTY GOOD ON THIS ONE. - KNEES DOWN A BIT. OH, MY GOD, WHY DID THAT HAPPEN? - WHAT HAPPENED? - ALL OF A SUDDEN, I SEE THAT "SQUEEZE" IS SPELLED WRONG. - PAINTERS, TIME IS UP! PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. - [exhales] - [bleep]. - YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. - YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I SEE EVERYTHING. ALL I COULD DO WAS JUST STARE AT IT. - PAINTERS, YOU CAN LEAVE THE SUPERMARKET, AND WE WILL SEE YOU AT THE ELIMINATION STAGE. - CAN'T BELIEVE THIS HAPPENED. I AM SO GOING HOME. - HELLO, PAINTERS. - HELLO. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - FOR THIS CONCEPT CHALLENGE, YOU TRAVELED TO THE SUPERMARKET TO TEST YOUR ABILITY TO CAMOUFLAGE YOUR MODEL. FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU'RE BEING JUDGED ON THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: CAMOUFLAGE AND BLENDING ABILITY, CREATIVITY AND DESIGN CONCEPT, TECHNIQUE, AND EXECUTION OF THE CHALLENGE. NOW, LET'S WELCOME BACK OUR ESTEEMED JUDGES: CRAIG TRACY, ROBIN SLONINA, AND RUPAUL CHARLES. - WORD UP! - HEY, RU. - WHAT UP, RU? - AND OUR VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE, THE FABULOUS EMMA CAMMACK. - HI, EVERYONE. NICE TO MEET YOU. [all cheering] - WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT ALL OF YOUR FINAL PICTURES. PAINTERS, WILL YOU PLEASE STEP TO THE SIDE? OKAY, NICOLE. - I FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY CHALLENGED YOURSELF. THIS WAS A TECHNICAL MONSTER. SO MUCH DETAIL IN THOSE JARS, AND I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. - NICOLE, I WAS REALLY STUNNED. I MEAN, YOU AMAZED ME. YOU'VE GOT SORT OF LITTLE BLURS THERE, WHICH IS A CLEVER CONCEIT TO USE, BUT DOESN'T QUITE WORK WHEN YOU BLOW IT UP AS A HUGE IMAGE. OVERALL, I MEAN, I THINK THIS IS A REALLY VALIANT EFFORT. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - GEAR? - [laughs] - OKAY, GEAR, I THINK YOU'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB, BUT YOU UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE THE EASIEST BACKGROUND OF ALL OF THEM. IT'S THE SAFE CHOICE FOR ME, AND IF YOU LOOK, YOU'VE GOT THIS SHADOW LINE THAT YOU CANNOT LOSE. IF YOU'D BURIED HER IN THE FRUIT, THE SHADOW LINE WOULD BE LOST, AND THE CONCEIT OF HER VANISHING INTO THE BACKGROUND WOULD BE SO MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE. - GOT YOU. OKAY. - BUT OVERALL, I MEAN, YOU KICKED IT. - I THINK THIS IS ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. YOU CLEARLY UTILIZED THE MONITOR TO MATCH THOSE COLORS UP. - I WAS ALMOST PAINTING LIKE THIS THE ENTIRE TIME, LOOKING AT THE MONITOR. - IT SHOWS. IT REALLY SHOWS. I WANTED TO SQUEEZE HER LEMONS. [laughter] - THANK YOU, GEAR. - THANK YOU. - NATALIE. - I MEAN, YOU CAN SEE THE CHALLENGE THAT WENT INTO THI--I MEAN, YOU REALLY PICKED A TOUGH SPOT. I MEAN, IT'S NOT PERFECT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT WONKY, BUT IT IS A VERY GOOD ATTEMPT. - YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS AS AN IMAGE, I CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE WHETHER SHE HAS HER LEG UP OR NOT... - RIGHT. - AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT THIS KIND OF PAINTING IS ALL ABOUT. IT'S A TRICK OF THE EYE. - THIS IS NOT A REALLY GOOD PAINTING. THIS IS A GREAT PAINTING. THIS IS EVERYTHING THAT I WANT TO SEE. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - ANGELA? - HAVE YOU EVER DONE THIS BEFORE? SO THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME. WERE YOU NERVOUS? - VERY, I'M--MY HEART'S STILL RACING RIGHT NOW. I'M SO NERVOUS, YES. EVERYTHING THAT COULD'VE WENT WRONG, WENT WRONG. - WHAT WENT WRONG? - WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, "SQUEEZE" IS SPELLED WRONG. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN IN SPECIAL ED ALL MY LIFE. LITERALLY--I'M SORRY, I'M NOT TRYING TO CRY, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M BACK IN SPECIAL ED, STARING AT A WORD, JUST THINKING, "HOW DO YOU SPELL THIS, HOW DO YOU SPELL THIS?" AND I STARE AT THAT, I'M LIKE, DARN. I WAS MOSTLY NERVOUS, BECAUSE I'M LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO GET MADE FUN OF. - WELL, I GOT TO TELL YA, YOU SQUEEZED THE "U" RIGHT OUT OF THAT SODA. [laughter] - I KNOW, RIGHT? - WELL, I CAN TELL YOU, ANGELA, THAT NOBODY WAS MAKING FUN OF YOU... - OKAY. - BECAUSE WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR TECHNIQUE. YOU REALLY HAD JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF--OF AIRBRUSH, AND HIGHLIGHTS. - I DO THINK THAT THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH THE WHITE. YOU'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET YOUR WHITES WHITE, AND THAT'S GONNA REALLY HELP YOU IN THE FUTURE. - MY SPELLING'S ATROCIOUS... - OKAY, OKAY. OKAY. - ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. BUT THE--THE ONE THING THAT IS REALLY VITAL IS THE LOGO. IF WE DID THIS FOR A COMMERCIAL SHOOT, IT WOULD BE UNUSABLE. WHEN I'M DOING STUFF LIKE LOGOS, I'M NOT THINKING OF IT AS A WORD. I'M LOOKING AT IT AS AN IMAGE, AND I'M COPYING THE IMAGE. THINK ABOUT IT THAT WAY, AND THAT MIGHT REALLY HELP YOU. - OKAY. - THANK YOU, ANGELA. - THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. I CAN'T BE ANY MORE OPEN THAN I AM NOW, AND FOR ONCE, I DIDN'T GET, LIKE, SOMEONE POINTING FINGERS AT ME AND LAUGHING, FOR ONCE. THANK YOU. - FELLE, YOU'RE UP. - YES, THANKS. - I'VE GOT TO SAY, I--I DO LOVE THIS PIECE. IN FACT, I WANT A LITTLE PIECE OF JAM AND SOME BUTTER. SHE LOOKS REAL GOOD. I'M JUST CURIOUS THAT YOU DIDN'T PUT ANY OTHER COLOR IN THERE, BECAUSE I CAN SEE THERE ARE DONUTS TO THE SIDE OVER THERE, BUT UM, LOVELY. - I THINK YOU'VE PULLED IT TOGETHER, BUT YOU CHOSE TO FRAME YOUR MODEL LIKE SHE'S CUT OFF AT THE KNEE. THIS WAS A HEAD-TO-TOE CHALLENGE, AND I WAS WONDERING WHY YOU'D CHOSEN TO DO THAT. - THE CAMERA ANGLE IN THE MONITOR WAS CUT OFF AT HER KNEES, SO I'M THINKING, THIS IS MY FRAME. - BUT SURELY IF YOU KNOW THAT IT'S A HEAD-TO-TOE CHALLENGE, YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE YOUR MODEL IS POSED, FROM HEAD-TO-TOE, WITHIN THAT FRAME. - SEAN. - THIS MAKES ME SMILE. SHE HAS JUST HER THUMB PAINTED, WRAPPED AROUND THE CEREAL BOWL. THOSE ARE SOME NICE, CREATIVE DETAILS. - AW, THANK YOU. - WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE CONSCIOUS OF HER HAIR? LIKE, TUCKING HER HAIR IN? - I HAD PLANNED ON THAT. [laughs] - AND YOU RAN OUT OF TIME? - THAT WAS ON MY--MY TASK LIST. - I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE POSSIBLY HAD A KIND OF CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE, AND TIME MANAGEMENT ISSUES, AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THE BEEHIVE, WE LOSE THE BITS OF DETAIL WHEN IT COMES AROUND HER THIGHS, AND IT'S JUST NOT QUITE THERE. - THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF PAINTING, ESPECIALLY IN THIS TIME FRAME. THAT'S THE BEST I COULD DO UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. - IF YOU CAN'T WORK WITHIN THE TIME FRAME THAT YOU WERE GIVEN, IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE COMPETITION. - IT'S JUST NOT QUITE THERE. - THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF PAINTING. THAT'S THE BEST I COULD DO IN THIS TIME FRAME. - IF YOU CAN'T WORK WITHIN THE TIME FRAME THAT YOU WERE GIVEN, IT DOESN'T WORK IN THE COMPETITION. - DUTCH. - DUTCH, YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD AS FAR AS THE CHALLENGE GOES. I MEAN, YOU DID DISAPPEAR YOUR MODEL INTO THAT BACKGROUND, BUT YOU ALSO HAD ONE OF THE MOST STATIC, YOU KNOW, "BORING" POSES. - I GET THE FEELING THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE SORT OF, YOU KNOW, "OH, IT'S DUTCH, SO YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA, YOU KNOW." - WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ASSUME THAT YOU'RE GONNA ACE STUFF? - UH, IT JUST-- I GUESS BY REPUTATION. - I'M SUPER FRUSTRATED WITH DUTCH'S ARROGANCE. I AM SO OVER IT. - DUTCH, THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE DOING ARE EXCEPTIONAL, BUT I WOULD LOVE IT IF SHE WERE HOLDING A CAN. APPLYING CREATIVITY GOES A LONG WAY. - OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. - SHANNON? - SHANNON, DARLING, YOUR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES LOOK DELICIOUS. - THANK YOU. - THE DETAIL ON THAT LETTUCE? IT'S--IT'S GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT. - THE TROUBLE IS, FOR ME, IS THAT I SEE YOUR MODEL. BUT I LOVE, I LOVE HOW YOU'VE PAINTED THE DETAIL OF THE FRUITS AND THE VEGETABLES. - THANK YOU. - MYTHICA. - I THINK YOU DID A-- ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD JOB IN THE COLOR MATCHING. IT WAS A VERY PLEASANT PIECE. - THERE'S GREAT STRENGTHS TO YOUR IMAGE, AND THERE'S SOME WEAKNESSES TO YOUR IMAGE, BUT IF YOU MIXED UP SOME OF THE YELLOW BUNCHES FOR ANOTHER BRIGHT COLOR, WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS YELLOW LINE GOING UP THE BODY, WHICH LOSES THE CONCEIT FOR ME, SLIGHTLY. - I MOVED AROUND A LOT OF THE FLOWERS TO TRY AND--AND DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, AND BY THAT TIME, I WAS 45 MINUTES INTO THE CHALLENGE, AND I WAS LIKE, I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. - I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THAT. - YEAH. - I FEEL YOU CAN DO BETTER. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP IN YOUR HEAD IN ANY KIND OF EXCUSE. - THANK YOU, MYTHICA. PAINTERS, THE JUDGES HAVE A DIFFICULT DECISION ON THEIR HANDS, AND A LOT TO DISCUSS. PLEASE HEAD BACK TO THE PAINTERS' LOUNGE. - THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE CHALLENGE. - THAT WAS REALLY HARD. MY CURRENT LIVING SITUATION IS I'M SLEEPING ON A DAYBED IN A LAUNDRY ROOM. I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME. - WHO DO YOU THINK WERE THE TOP PAINTERS TODAY? - FOR ME, IT WAS NATALIE. - SHE GAVE HERSELF THIS POSE THAT WAS JUST AMAZING. - THERE WAS THIS SORT OF WARPED FEELING IN THE MID-BACK AREA OF THE MODEL. IT FELT REALLY OFF. - DUTCH IS AN AMAZING PAINTER, AND HE KNOWS IT. HE'S COCKY FOR A REASON. - SHE DISAPPEARED INTO THOSE CANS. - YEAH. - I WOULD BE FOOLED, AND I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL. - TO ME, HIM PICKING THAT STATIC POSE WAS KIND OF LAZY. HE'S GOT TO PUMP UP HIS CREATIVITY. - AND THEN GEAR? - GEAR WAS AMAZING. - I WAS EXPECTING VERTICAL, AND HE GAVE ME HORIZONTAL. - HE DID HORIZONTAL. HE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT DID HORIZONTAL. - BUT I DO SLIGHTLY FEEL LIKE HE PLAYED IT SAFE. - IT IS THE EASIEST CHOICE. - IT IS. - BUT I KIND OF FEEL LIKE IT'S THE SMARTEST CHOICE. - AND WHO WHERE THE PAINTERS WHO DIDN'T DO SO WELL TODAY? - SEAN DIDN'T DO VERY WELL TODAY. - HE LEFT ALL THAT BLACK HAIR. - THE HAIR! - IT WAS LIKE THE HEAD HAD A BIG BLACK OUTLINE. - THAT'S SO IMPORTANT! - MM-HM. - YOU CAN'T MISS IT. - NOW, ANGELA'S PIECE... IF WE WERE BEING ANGELA'S CLIENT, I WOULD HAVING TO BE FIRING HER, BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SHE MISSPELLED THE WORD. - YOU'RE RIGHT, IF SHE KNOWS THAT SHE HAS A PROBLEM WITH SPELLING, MAKE UP FOR IT BEFORE YOU START THE PROJECT. - YES. - MYTHICA'S PAINTING WAS MESSY. - I WAS LOOKING AT A LACK OF SHARPNESS IN HER WORK. - IT WAS--IT WAS "MESS-ICA." - [laughs] - GUYS, HAVE YOU MADE YOUR DECISION? - YEP. - I THINK SO. - LET'S BRING THEM OUT. WELCOME BACK, PAINTERS. EVEN THOUGH ALL OF YOU DID GREAT WORK, ONLY ONE OF YOU CAN BE THE WINNER, AND ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT. FELLE, SHANNON, AND NICOLE... CONGRATULATIONS, YOU ARE SAFE. YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO THE PAINTERS' LOUNGE. GEAR, NATALIE, DUTCH... CONGRATULATIONS. YOU ARE THE TOP THREE. ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WINNER. NATALIE... YOU ARE THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE. - YEAH! [applause] - [sighs] - WHOO! - YOU MASTERED BOTH THE CREATIVE AND THE TECHNICAL ASPECT OF THE CHALLENGE. THE JUDGES WERE SO IMPRESSED WITH YOU. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YEAH. - YOU CAN ALL HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - THANK YOU! [applause] - IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BEAT THE BOYS, SO GOOD, 'CAUSE CAMO'S HARD, AND THEY KNOW IT. - YEAH, GET IT, GIRL, GET IT, GIRL. GET IT, GIRL. - [laughing] YEAH. - I CAN SEE THE VEINS POPPING OUT OF HIS BIG ARMS. - MYTHICA, ANGELA, SEAN... ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT. - I JUST SERIOUSLY DON'T WANT TO GO HOME RIGHT NOW. - MYTHICA, ANGELA, SEAN... ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT. MYTHICA... WHILE THE JUDGES SAW SOME GLIMMERS OF HOPE THIS WEEK, OVERALL, WE STILL FEEL YOUR PAINTING FELL FLAT. NO MORE EXCUSES. MYTHICA... YOU ARE SAFE. - THANK YOU. - YOU CAN JOIN THE OTHERS IN THE LOUNGE. - THANK YOU. I AM NOT GONNA WIN $100,000 IF I KEEP DOING WHAT I'M DOING. - CONGRATULATIONS. - I'VE GOT TO STAY ON TOP NOW, OR...I'M--I'M GOING HOME. [exhales] - SEAN... IT'S OBVIOUS THAT TIME MANAGEMENT BECAME AN ISSUE FOR YOU. EVERYONE HAS THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME, AND THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR THE LACK OF DETAILS ON YOUR PAINTING. AND ANGELA... IF YOU TURNED IN THIS WORK TO A CLIENT, YOU WOULD BE FIRED. SEAN... YOUR JOURNEY ENDS HERE. - IT'S OKAY. - IT'S NOT A GOOD PERSON CONTEST. [laughs] - ANGELA... YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - [laughs] [exhales] - I HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT I WAS GOING HOME, BUT WHEN IT GETS TOUGH, YOU JUST HAVE TO TOUGH IT UP AND JUST KEEP GOING. [exhales] - ANGELA. - YOU'RE STILL WITH US. - I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING ME HERE. - SEAN, WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT MORE GREAT WORK AHEAD OF YOU. - SEAN... IT'S TIME TO WASH OFF YOUR CANVAS. - AW. - GOOD-BYE, AND GOOD LUCK. - THANK YOU, EVERYBODY, ONCE AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - THANK YOU. - I AM PRETTY DISAPPOINTED. IN THE INDUSTRY, I'M CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BIG PLAYERS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY THOUGHT THAT I'D BE THE SECOND ONE OFF. YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I'M A SELF-SABOTAGER, AND I THINK I'VE BEEN AFRAID TO VALUE WHAT I DO. ARTISTS NEED TO BE ABLE TO CHECK THAT AT THE DOOR. I JUST REALLY WANTED TO DO A GOOD JOB, JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO... SHOW THE WORLD WHAT I GOT. - NEXT TIME, ON SKIN WARS... TODAY, IT'S ALL ABOUT TEAMWORK. - THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN FELLE AND I. - NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO LEARN. - NOW IS THE TIME TO LEARN. - NOT IN A $100,000 CHALLENGE. - OKAY, FELLE, OKAY. - YOU NEED TO REALLY GO TO SLEEP, AND THINK ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT. - I'VE HAD ENOUGH. - DON'T LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET YOU SENT HOME. - FASHION DESIGNER CARSON KRESSLEY. - I FEEL SO OVERDRESSED. - THIS JUST DIDN'T CUT IT. - YOU WERE A BIT OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT. - THE BOTTOM DOWN LOOKS REALLY MESSY TO ME. - IT'S TIME TO WASH OFF YOUR CANVAS.
