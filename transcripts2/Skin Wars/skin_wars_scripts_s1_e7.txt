 THAT'S GOT YOU EXTRA EXCITED TODAY? - [sighs] JOANNE GAIR IS MY IDOL. LIKE, MY IDOL. I WROTE HER FAN LETTERS LIKE A CELEBRITY. - PLEASE WELCOME THE INCREDIBLE JOANNE GAIR. SHE'S THE ARTIST BEHIND SOME OF THE MOST ICONIC BODY-PAINTING IMAGES EVER. SHE ALSO HAPPENS TO BE THE VERY FIRST PERSON WHO EVER PAINTED ME. JOANNE GAIR IS A SUPER AMAZING, ICONIC BODY PAINTER. EVERYBODY IN THIS INDUSTRY KNOWS WHO SHE IS. - THEY ARE HERE TO JUDGE TODAY'S CHALLENGE. FOR MOST OF THE CHALLENGES, YOU'VE BEEN REQUIRED TO USE EVERY INCH OF YOUR MODEL'S BODY. BUT TODAY, YOU'LL BE FOCUSING ON A MUCH SMALLER CANVAS. FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL BE USING HANDS. YOU WILL HAVE TWO HOURS TO PAINT AN ELBOW-TO-FINGER LOOK. YOU CAN USE ANYTHING YOU WANT AS YOUR INSPIRATION. - THIS MIGHT BE A SMALL CANVAS, BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY GO BIG FOR THIS CHALLENGE. - AND MAYBE YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SHAPE OF THE HAND BEFORE YOU BEGIN. WHAT'S INTERESTING, OUT-OF-THE-BOX DIFFERENT? - THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE WILL WIN A MAJOR ADVANTAGE FOR THE UPCOMING CHALLENGE. YOU ARE ONLY ONE ELIMINATION AWAY FROM THE $100,000 GRAND PRIZE. THE ADVANTAGE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. - WE ALL CAME HERE WITH A GOAL-- HUGE CHECK IN HAND FOR 100 GRAND. I'VE GOTTA BRING IT. - PAINTERS, HOPE YOU'RE READY TO GET HANDSY, BECAUSE YOUR TIME STARTS NOW! - OH. - I'M GONNA JUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS. - WE'RE DOWN TO THE FINAL FOUR. I HAVE NO ROOM FOR MISTAKES. I HAVE SACRIFICED A LOT. I NEED TO WIN THIS. - I'M GONNA BUST OUT SOME PAINT, SO IF YOU JUST WANNA HAVE A SEAT AND MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE-- - TRY THIS. THIS WAS ONE IDEA I WAS KIND OF PLAYING WITH. - WHAT KIND OF AN ANIMAL COULD WE MAKE? WE HAVE TWO HOURS TO DO THIS PAINT JOB, AND I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I WANT TO PAINT. - ALL RIGHT, SO HOLD THAT LEFT HAND UP FIRST. MY CONCEPT IS ADAM AND EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. SO I START WITH THE SNAKE. KEEP YOUR KNUCKLES FLAT LIKE THAT. THERE YOU GO. THE SNAKE IS VERY EASY FOR ME. I'VE RENDERED SNAKES AND DRAGONS A MILLION TIMES. I KNOW I CAN PULL OFF A VERY REALISTIC SNAKE. - SPREAD YOUR FINGERS SUPER WIDE FOR ME. I DECIDE ON A GARGOYLE WITH WINGS. I DON'T NORMALLY DO DARK, CREEPY SORT OF BODY-PAINT CONCEPTS, BUT I'M REALLY EXCITED TO EXPERIMENT WITH THIS ONE. - YEAH. MY CONCEPT TODAY IS GOING TO BE THE LAVA LANDS THAT I COME FROM. SO I'M BASICALLY GONNA DO, LIKE, A SERENE, BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE AND THEN HAVE HER ARMS TRANSITION INTO AN EXPLODING VOLCANO. - LET'S DO A STORY. - MM-HMM. - THERE'S THIS GREAT GREEK MYTH THAT INVOLVES A PEACOCK AND A COW, SO I'M GONNA PAINT A PEACOCK AND A COW. HOW DO COWS LOOK? THEY'RE LIKE THIS. - WHEN A SNAKE OPENS ITS JAWS, THE FANGS FOLD OUT. - GUYS, JUST ONE HOUR LEFT. HALF YOUR TIME IS GONE. IN CHALLENGES, WHEN I'M UNDER PRESSURE, THAT'S THE BEST TIME FOR ME TO GET IN THE ZONE. IT'S CRUNCH TIME. I'M SERIOUS. OKAY, WHERE'S MY EYE? WHERE'S MY PEACOCK EYE? - SPREAD THOSE HANDS OUT FOR ME A LITTLE BIT. - I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS IS GONNA TAKE ME, SO WE'LL JUST SEE HOW IT GOES. - MISS NATALIE, CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING PART OF THE FINAL FOUR. - THANK YOU. BUT DON'T YOU MISS GEAR? I'M LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM, AND EVERYONE'S DOING SOME REALLY COOL STUFF. LIKE, I SEE NICOLE ACTUALLY USED A LITTLE BIT OF PROSTHETIC TO MAKE, LIKE, WINGS. - TEN MINUTES, GUYS. - DUTCH, AS USUAL, HIS PIECE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. [timer beeps] - OKAY, PAINTERS. TIME'S UP. PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. OKAY, GUYS, WELL, YOU HAD TWO HOURS TO TRANSFORM YOUR MODELS' HANDS, AND NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE WHO CAME OUT ON TOP. - I'M LOOKING AROUND AT MY COMPETITORS, AND I'M THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT A TRANSITION IN MY PIECE. I'M WONDERING IF THIS IS GONNA WORK AGAINST ME TODAY. - JUDGES, LET'S TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. - OKAY. - HEY, DUTCH. - HI. - TELL US ABOUT YOUR PAINTING AND YOUR INSPIRATION. - I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS SORT OF NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. I AM A CHRISTIAN. AND SO I THOUGHT OF THE SNAKE, WHICH IS A TWO-PART REVEAL, 'CAUSE WHEN SHE OPENS UP... - OH. - THERE'S A FANG ON THE INSIDE. AND THEN OVER HERE IS THE-- THE TREE OF FORBIDDEN FRUIT. - OH. - MM-HMM. - AND THEN WHEN SHE HOLDS BOTH OF HER HANDS UP TOGETHER, IT REVEALS THE STORY. - [laughs] - WOW. - VERY NICE. - A TRIPLE--TRIPLE PLAY. - TRIPLE REVEAL, YEAH. - VERY NICE. - MAN, YOU JUST KEEP GIVING IT TO US. - REALLY NICE JOB, DUTCH. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU, DUTCH. - WELL DONE. - THANK YOU. - HI, NATALIE. - HELLO, JUDGES. - HOW'S IT GOING? - IT'S GOING GOOD. - CAN YOU PLEASE TELL US ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT? - I LIVE IN CENTRAL OREGON, WHICH IS JUST, LIKE, BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAINS, SERENE, GORGEOUS, BUT WHAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS THE LAVA LANDS. A LOT OF THE MOUNTAINS IN OREGON ARE STILL VOLCANOES. SO I DID THIS BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN. YOU CAN ALMOST HEAR THE BIRDS CHIRPING, BUT AT ANY MOMENT... - AH. [gasps] - OH, WOW! - A SURPRISE! - ANY MOMENT... both: WOW. - A VOLCANO COULD EXPLODE, SO-- - OH, MY GOODNESS. YOUR STORYTELLING IS QUITE UNIQUE. - THANK YOU. - WELL DONE. - THANK YOU! TO HAVE FREAKING JOANNE GAIR TELL ME THAT SHE LOVES MY PIECE BLOWS MY MIND. [exhales] IT WAS AWESOME. - HEY, SHANNON. HOW ARE YOU? - HI, REBECCA. - WILL YOU TELL US ABOUT YOUR PAINTING AND YOUR INSPIRATION, PLEASE? - SURE. SURE. SO MY PAINTING COMES FROM A STORY IN GREEK MYTHOLOGY WHERE ZEUS IS WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND ON THE SIDE. HERA FINDS OUT AND TURNS HER INTO A COW. - OH, MY GOODNESS. - OH, MY GOODNESS, EXACTLY. - AND SHE PROVIDES A WATCHMAN THERE. TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE, HE'S GOT A THOUSAND EYES, BUT ZEUS IS SMARTER THAN THAT, 'CAUSE HE'S DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE HIS PIECE ON THE SIDE. SO HE TURNS-- - OH, MY. - HE TURNS THE WATCHMAN WITH A THOUSAND EYES INTO A PEACOCK. - MM-HMM. - WHOA! - YOU ALSO CHALLENGED YOURSELF WITH THE WAY SHE'S HOLDING HER HANDS TOO. THAT'S NOT A NATURAL MOVEMENT GOING FROM ONE TO ANOTHER. - THANK YOU. - I LOVE MY PIECE, BUT COMPARED TO EVERYONE ELSE'S, IT DOES NOT LOOK NEARLY AS DETAILED. - HI, NICOLE. - HI. - HOW'S IT GOING? - GREAT. HOW ARE YOU GUYS? - GOOD, THANKS. - WE'RE GOOD. - TELL US ABOUT YOUR PAINTING AND YOUR INSPIRATION. - WELL, I REALLY WANTED TO GO DARK TODAY. I DECIDED TO DO A WINGED GARGOYLE. - WOW. NOW, WE DON'T KNOW YOU AS GOING SO DARK. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO GO DARK TODAY? - I REALLY WANTED TO STEP OUTSIDE THE BOX. YOU KNOW, I'M KNOWN FOR MY SUPER GIRLIE DESIGNS. I WANTED TO GO DARK, DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT TODAY, AND MAYBE SURPRISE YOU GUYS A LITTLE BIT. - I WAS VERY SURPRISED. - AND IS THERE MOVEMENT POSSIBLE WITH THE FINGERS? - YES. HE DOES FLAP HIS WINGS AS HE FLIES THROUGH THE AIR. - CAN YOU DO THAT WITH YOUR-- - GREAT. THANKS, NICOLE. - THANK YOU, GUYS. - THANK YOU. - WOW. - I KNOW, THE STANDARD'S SO HIGH. - YEAH, RIGHT? WHAT DO YOU THINK? - WELL, FIRST OFF, WE HAD FOUR GREAT PIECES. - YEAH. - AND NOW, THE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE GONNA SEPARATE THEM. - NATALIE'S SORT OF STOOD OUT ON ITS OWN. - WITH THE LANDSCAPE. - YEAH. AND ALSO THE WAY THAT SHE CHOSE HER BODY LANGUAGE. PEACEFULNESS-- - PANORAMA. - EXACTLY, AND THEN BREAKING INTO THE EXPLOSION, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE VOLCANO WAS ALL ABOUT. - YEAH. - IT FELT EFFORTLESS... both: YEAH. - THE TRANSITION, SO WHEN SHE TOLD THE STORY, IT JUST WAS, THERE IT IS. - YEAH. - THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF WORK OR AWKWARDNESS THAT MADE IT DETRACT. - RIGHT, AND IT WAS VERY ORIGINAL. - YEAH. - BUT I THOUGHT THE EXECUTION OF THE PAINTING THAT DUTCH DID, THAT WAS WONDERFUL. - DUTCH IS A MASTER TECHNICIAN. THAT SNAKE, I DON'T THINK, COULD BE PAINTED ANY BETTER IN THAT AMOUNT OF TIME BY ANYONE. BUT I THOUGHT, BECAUSE HE HAD THREE TRANSITIONS, THEY DIDN'T FLOW EFFORTLESSLY. - HMM, RIGHT. - YOU KNOW? - WHAT'D YOU THINK ABOUT SHANNON'S WORK? - I REALLY LIKED IT. THAT WAS QUITE A STORY TO BEGIN WITH, WASN'T IT? both: YEAH. - GREEK MYTHOLOGY AND BEING ABLE TO PUT ALL OF THAT TOGETHER IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME... - RIGHT. - REALLY SMART. - I FELT IT WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE FACE, THOUGH. - THE PEACOCK FACE. - YEAH, THE FACE OF THE PEACOCK. - WELL, I GUESS IN ORDER TO GET THAT BEAK RIGHT, SHE HAD TO PAINT OUT THE NEGATIVE SPACE IN THE BLACK AROUND THE BEAK. - RIGHT. - AND WHAT'D YOU THINK ABOUT NICOLE'S PAINTING? - I WAS SURPRISED, BECAUSE SHE WENT DARK. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE REALLY SOLD THAT PIECE TO ME IS IF SHE WOULD HAVE HAD A TRANSITION ELEMENT WHERE IF THE BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN A BUTTERFLY. - OH. - OH, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN GREAT. - YOU KNOW, THEY'RE ALL HERE AND DOWN TO THE FINAL FOUR FOR A REASON. - ALL RIGHT. HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND? - I THINK SO, YEAH. - YEAH. - OKAY, LET'S DO IT. - OKAY. - OKAY, PAINTERS, FOR THIS CHALLENGE, EACH OF YOU HAD TO CREATE A PAINTING USING ONLY YOUR MODEL'S HANDS AND FOREARMS AS A CANVAS. NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHICH PAINTER'S CREATION GOT TWO THUMBS UP FROM OUR JUDGES. - I'VE BEEN IN THE BOTTOM THE LAST TWO CONCEPT CHALLENGES, AND JOANNE GAIR IS JUDGING. I HAVE TO WIN THIS. - THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... - NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHICH PAINTER'S CREATION GOT TWO THUMBS UP FROM OUR JUDGES. DUTCH... NATALIE... PLEASE STEP FORWARD. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE THE TOP TWO. - THANK YOU. - DUTCH, YOU BLEW OUR MINDS WITH THE TECHNICAL ABILITY. RIGHT ON THE MONEY. BRAVO TO YOU, SIR. WONDERFUL PAINTING. - APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU. - NATALIE, I DEFINITELY AM BLOWN AWAY WITH YOUR SKILL. THE EXECUTION OF THE INSIDE OF THE HANDS IS AS BEAUTIFUL AS THE OUTSIDE. IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFULLY DONE. - THANK YOU. - YOU BOTH DID AN AMAZING JOB, ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. BUT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER. THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... NATALIE. CONGRATULATIONS! - THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - NATALIE, YOU SEEM A LITTLE EXTRA EXCITED RIGHT NOW. - IT'S SO COOL. IT'S JUST SO COOL. - IS IT SO COOL? - I JUST--LIKE, WHEN I STARTED BODY PAINTING, I WOULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED HAVING THESE TWO IN FRONT OF ME, YOU KNOW, LIKE, TELLING ME THAT I WON SOMETHING. [laughter] IT'S, LIKE, THE COOLEST MOMENT OF MY BODY-PAINTING CAREER FOR SURE, RIGHT HERE. - AW. - THANK YOU, MODELS. BEAUTIFUL JOB. - BYE, GALS. - BYE. - THIS IS THE LAST CHALLENGE BEFORE THE FINALS. - [sighs] THE STAKES ARE REALLY HIGH NOW. AND THERE'S SO MUCH PRESSURE TO JUST BRING EVERYTHING THAT YOU HAVE TO THE TABLE. - MAKE IT THROUGH, AND YOU WILL BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE $100,000 GRAND PRIZE. FOR THIS CONCEPT CHALLENGE, WE WILL BE TESTING YOU ON ONE OF THE MOST ADVANCED SKILLS IN BODY PAINTING-- MULTI-BODY ILLUSION. - THIS IS A BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN I THOUGHT. IT'S REALLY INTIMIDATING. - YOUR MODELS' BODIES MUST BE POSED PRECISELY, SO THEY COME TOGETHER TO CREATE ONE MIND-BLOWING IMAGE. - I'VE NEVER WORKED ON MULTIPLE BODIES. I'VE NEVER JOINED BODIES TO CREATE A SINGLE IMAGE BEFORE. - DO IT CORRECTLY, AND THE BODIES COMPLETELY DISAPPEAR, REVEALING A SEAMLESS 3-D PAINTING OF YOUR SUBJECT. WE'RE BRINGING IN SPECIALTY MODELS, SO YOU CAN CONTORT YOUR MODELS INTO THE SHAPE OF ANY OBJECT YOU DESIRE. - AND I'VE NEVER WORKED WITH CONTORTIONISTS. THIS IS ALL NEW TERRITORY FOR ME. THIS IS GONNA BE TOUGH. - YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS TO COMPLETE THIS MULTI-BODY LOOK. - SIX HOURS IS NOT A LOT OF TIME TO DO A MULTI-BODY PIECE ON MY OWN AND DO IT THE WAY THAT I WANT TO DO IT. - EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED OF PAINTERS STRUGGLE TO MASTER THIS CUTTING-EDGE SKILL. - YOU HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN GIVEN PROBABLY THE HARDEST CHALLENGE TO DO, AND CRAIG, OF COURSE, IS A MASTER OF THIS. SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU ALL. - CRAIG AND JOANNE WILL BE BACK TOMORROW. - ENJOY THE PROCESS. - THANK YOU, GUYS. - SEE YOU SOON. - THANK YOU. - THIS CHALLENGE IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING, SO YOU WILL HAVE HELP FOR THIS CHALLENGE. HELPERS, COME ON OUT! - [gasps] - [gasps] - OH, MY GOSH! - HELLO, LOVELIES. [cheers and applause] - OH! HI! - ALL OF A SUDDEN, MYTHICA, GEAR, FELLE, AND ANGELA WALK IN. THIS IS GOING TO BE INTERESTING. - HERE WE ARE. HERE WE ARE. REDEMPTION. - HOWDY, STRANGERS. - I HAD NO IDEA I WOULD SEE GEAR AGAIN SO SOON. THE TERMS THAT WE LEFT ON... - THE LAST THING I WANNA DO IS CHALLENGE A FRIEND. - [crying] - KICK SOME ASS. - SO EMOTIONAL. - SO YOU'RE PROBABLY WONDERING WHO IS PAIRED WITH WHOM, WHICH BRINGS ME TO NATALIE'S ADVANTAGE. NATALIE, YOU GET TO CHOOSE EVERYONE'S HELPERS, SO CHOOSE WISELY. - I CAN PICK THE PEOPLE WHO BUTT HEADS THE MOST AND HOPE THAT I JUST RISE TO THE TOP BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S FIGHTING THE WHOLE TIME. - REALLY THINK ABOUT YOUR CHOICES. - IF NATALIE PUTS ME WITH MYTHICA, MY PAINT JOB IS GOING TO SUCK. MYTHICA, YOU'LL BE LOSING 30 MINUTES. I FEEL THIS KIND OF SICK FEELING IN MY STOMACH. - NATALIE, YOU GET TO PICK FIRST FOR YOURSELF. - GEAR. - THANK YOU. - NATALIE KNOWS MY FEELINGS ABOUT WORKING WITH FELLE. FELLE, DON'T-- DON'T PULL THAT [bleep]! - IT WAS A JOKE, NICOLE. - THAT WASN'T A JOKE. I'M REALLY HOPING THAT SHE DOESN'T PAIR ME WITH HIM. - NOW YOU GET TO CHOOSE FOR DUTCH. - FOR DUTCH, I PICK FELLE. - NOW YOU GET TO PICK FOR NICOLE. - FOR NICOLE, I PICK MYTHICA. - MYTHICA. - YAY! - SO THAT MEANS, SHANNON, YOU'RE WORKING WITH ANGELA. OKAY, NOW THAT YOU ALL HAVE YOUR HELPERS, I'M GONNA LET YOU GET BACK TO WORK. BUT BEFORE I LEAVE, I CANNOT STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF TOMORROW'S CHALLENGE. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO PLAY IT SAFE. GOOD NIGHT, PAINTERS. GOOD LUCK! - THANK YOU. - GOOD NIGHT. - SEE YOU TOMORROW. [excited chatter] - YEAH. - ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS. - LET'S GET BUSY. - I WAS VERY, VERY HAPPY THAT I GOT FELLE. I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD PARTNERING, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HE IS GOING TO BE SUBSERVIENT TO ME, AND I KNOW THAT HE IS GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS ASSET. I'M THINKING TWO SETS OF BUTTS HERE. - YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SKULL, RIGHT? - YEAH. - I'M THINKING COLORFUL. I'M FEELING OKAY BEING PAIRED UP WITH ANGELA. SHE'S VERY AMBITIOUS. SHE'S A FAST PAINTER, AND SHE'S A GREAT LISTENER. AN ANIMAL THAT I'M CONNECTED WITH IS THE FOX. - OKAY. - KIND OF LIKE FOXY LADY. - OH, I LIKE THAT. OKAY. - OKAY. I THINK THAT WORKS FOR YOU. - YEAH. - I'VE BEEN PLAYING IT SAFE LATELY, AND I REALLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING, LIKE, RISKY. THERE WAS SOME BAD ENERGY BETWEEN MYTHICA AND SHANNON AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE. BUT MYTHICA IS AN AMAZING PAINTER, AND WE GET ALONG REALLY WELL. - THIS IS JUST THE IDEA THAT I'M PLAYING WITH, AND YOU MIGHT HATE IT. - NO, NO. GO FOR IT. - I KIND OF WANT TO DO A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH. - HMM. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS NOT TO DO FOOD. AND I HATE PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES. BUT HEY, I'M HERE TO HELP, AND IF THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO, THEN THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO DO. IT COULD DEFINITELY SEND YOU HOME. - BUT I'M REALLY LIKING THE DIRECTION THAT IT'S GOING. - OKAY. - NOBODY'S MAD ABOUT THE WAY I PICKED, RIGHT? - NO, THAT'S GREAT PICKIN'S. I'M HERE TO COMPETE. I WOULD HAVE PARTNERED PEOPLE TO WHERE THERE WAS DISCORD AND FRUSTRATION WITH THE TEAM-UPS. - I COULD HAVE GONE SUPER VINDICTIVE WITH IT, BUT I DIDN'T. - YOU WENT SUPER HELPFUL TO EVERYONE ELSE TOO. - AND I'M STILL GONNA WIN. I HOPE YOU ALL KNOW THAT. - FOR OUR CONCEPT CHALLENGE TODAY, WE HAVE TO TAKE CONTORTIONIST MODELS AND CREATE THE IMAGERY OF OUR CHOICE. THEY'RE GIVING US CONTORTIONISTS, I'M GONNA USE CONTORTIONISTS. I'M NOT GONNA GO JUST STACK A BUNCH OF PEOPLE BACK-TO-BACK AND PAINT A MURAL. - HEY, GOOD MORNING, GUYS. ARE YOU ALL RESTED? - HOW LONG CAN YOU STAY UPSIDE DOWN FOR? - FIVE MINUTES. - OKAY. MY CONCEPT IS FOX FACE, AND IT'S AN ANTIFUR CAMPAIGN. - THIS PART CAN BE DARK HERE, AND THEN JUST ADD THE PAINT HERE, SO IT LOOKS LIKE-- - UH-HUH. - YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? - IN ALL OF YOUR YEARS OF THINGS THAT YOU'VE DONE, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN A SANDWICH, RIGHT? - NO. - OKAY. OKAY. I AM GOING SUPER WEIRD WITH MY CONCEPT. THE SIDE'S LOOKING GREAT. - YEP. - FILLED, FILLED, FILLED. THE JUDGES ARE EITHER GONNA LIKE IT, OR THEY'RE GONNA HATE IT. - THE BREAD UNDERNEATH SHOULD GO FIRST. - RIGHT. - OKAY, SO EACH ONE LAPS OVER CORRECTLY, OVER THE OTHERS, SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WORK BACKWARDS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I MEAN, I'VE PAINTED SOME PRETTY CRAZY [bleep], BUT PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH-- I MEAN, I'M WORRIED THAT IT MIGHT FALL FLAT WITH THE JUDGES. I WOULD HAVE PICKED MAYBE MORE OF A DYNAMIC POSE. - WE SHOULD PROBABLY BLACK OUT EVERYTHING AROUND IT, RIGHT? MY CONCEPT FOR THIS CHALLENGE IS BASED ON EMPOWERMENT. I'M VERY INSPIRED BY FIGURES LIKE AMELIA EARHART. - YOU DO DETAIL. I'LL DO THE CRAZY SIMPLE STUFF. - OKAY. I'VE DECIDED NOT TO HAVE MY MODELS HAVE SUPER DIFFICULT POSES. THAT WOULD EAT INTO MY TIME THAT I NEED FOR PAINTING, ME BEING A SLOWER PAINTER. - WE DON'T EVEN GOT OUR BASE ON, AND IT'S ALREADY AN HOUR IN. I'M KNOWN FOR LIKING SKULLS, AND SO MY CONCEPT TODAY IS A CYBERNETIC SKULL, JUST PLAIN AND SIMPLE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S ASSUME THE POSITION. I HAVE BEEN DENYING MYSELF THE ABILITY TO DO FUN THINGS BECAUSE OF MY SORT OF BUILT-IN DESIRE TO WIN AND TO COMPETE. TRY TO BOW YOUR BACK JUST A LITTLE BIT FOR ME, BUDDY. I WANT TO CUT LOOSE TODAY, AND I WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN. - ANGELA, YOU CAN STOP DOING THAT. I CAN MATCH MY OWN STROKES. - OKAY. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE, ANGELA? - MAKING THE EYE POP. - PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL, AND WATCH YOUR LINE WORK, OKAY? - I'M-- - IN THIS CHALLENGE, ANGELA ISN'T THE ONE GOING HOME, IT'S ME. ANGELA'S ALREADY GONE, SO SHE'S HERE TO HELP ME WIN MYSELF UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL. - I DON'T LIKE PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES. GEAR DOESN'T LIKE THE CONCEPT, PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES, BUT I DON'T CARE. I'M NOT GONNA SELF-DOUBT. THIS IS MY PIECE AND MY BUTT ON THE LINE. - NATALIE'S PIECE, REGARDLESS OF THE SUBJECT MATTER, IT LOOKS STAGNANT AND BORING. I THINK SHE'S THE ONE GOING HOME TODAY. - HOW YOU DOING, HON? YOU OKAY? - I'M GREAT. - ALL RIGHT. - GOOD MORNING, PAINTERS AND HELPERS! all: GOOD MORNING. - OH, LOOK, THE GANG'S ALL BACK TOGETHER AGAIN! YAY! [applause] WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M HERE WITH OUR ESTEEMED JUDGES, CRAIG TRACY AND RUPAUL CHARLES, WHO WANNA WALK AROUND AND TAKE A CLOSER LOOK. - ALL RIGHT. - LET'S DO IT. - LET'S DO IT. HEY, SHANNON. - HI, REBECCA. - HI. WHAT IS GOING ON? - MY THEME IS TO GO WITH A FOX FACE. - HOW LONG CAN YOUR MODELS STAY IN THIS POSE? - THEY SHOULD GET OUT OF THE POSE, LIKE, VERY SOON. - VERY SOON. - HOW CAN YOU WORK ON THIS WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN THEIR FORMATION? - THE FIRST THING I DID WAS SKETCHED IT OUT IN WHITE, AND THEN I MARKED IT, KIND OF LIKE A PAINT BY NUMBER-- THIS AREA IS WHITE. THIS AREA IS ORANGE. - NOW, SHANNON, ARE THERE ANY JITTERS? BECAUSE THIS IS THE LAST CHALLENGE BEFORE THE FINAL. - TOTALLY. YOU KNOW, I'M-- I'M LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM, AND I'M SEEING AMAZING WORK ALL THE WAY AROUND. SO IT'S ALWAYS ANYBODY'S GAME. - WELL, GOOD LUCK, SHANNON. - THANK YOU. - CANNOT WAIT TO SEE WHAT IS IN STORE FOR US. HI, NICOLE. HI, MYTHICA. - HELLO. - HEY. - HEY. - WHAT IS GOING ON OVER HERE? - WE ARE DOING A PIECE ABOUT FEMALE EMPOWERMENT. WE HAVE OUR STEAM PUNK PILOT HERE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE HAIR FLYING, AND OUR SCARF IS GOING TO BE FLYING IN THE WIND. WE WERE REALLY INSPIRED BY AMELIA EARHART. - SO YOU'RE SAYING AMELIA EARHART. ALL I SEE IS SIR MIX-A-LOT. [laughter] 'CAUSE BABY GOT BACK! - UH-HUH. - WE ARE INCORPORATING A LOT OF BUTTS IN OUR--IN OUR PAINTING. - I LIKE THAT. THAT'S MY FAVORITE KIND OF ART. - AND ARE YOU USING THE VIDEO CAMERA AND THE MONITOR? - YES, VERY MUCH SO. - YES, I'VE BEEN UTILIZING THAT THE ENTIRE TIME. - THAT'S GREAT. - THE FACE HAS BEEN TRICKY, AND I'M STILL TRYING TO GET THE PROPORTIONS RIGHT. YOU DON'T ERASE-- I NEVER ERASE, BUT TODAY, I'M ERASING. - AND WHEN YOU DO ERASE, WHAT TECHNIQUE DO YOU USE? - I'VE JUST BEEN USING BABY WIPES AND THEN-- - THE UNIVERSAL BODY-PAINT ERASER... - YES. - IS BABY WIPES, FOR ANYBODY THAT DIDN'T KNOW. - YES, I'VE JUST BEEN SCRUBBING THAT OFF AND THEN GOING OVER IT. - GOOD LUCK, NICOLE. THANK YOU, MYTHICA. both: THANK YOU. - BYE. - HELLO, NATALIE AND GEAR. - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, REBECCA? - HI, JUDGES. - WHAT'S HAPPENING OVER HERE? - WELL, I'M DOING A PB&J.; - OH, WOW! - WHEN DID THIS IDEA COME INTO YOUR HEAD? - WAS IT AROUND LUNCH, BY ANY CHANCE? - I'M GONNA ASK THE QUESTION THAT'S ON EVERYBODY'S MIND. - HERE WE GO. [laughs] - IS THE PEANUT BUTTER CHUNKY OR SMOOTH? - IT'S CREAMY. - OH, IT'S CREAMY. - IT'S CREAMY. - GOOD QUESTION. GOOD QUESTION. WELL, NATALIE, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN AT A LOSS FOR CREATIVITY. - THANKS. - OKAY, DUTCH AND FELLE. - WELL, YOU GOT YOUR HANDS FULL. - WHAT'S GOING ON OVER HERE? - AS YOU CAN SEE, WE HAVE SOMEONE IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION. - WE CAN SEE THAT. - HOW MUCH MORE TIME WE GOT, GUYS? - A MINUTE. - A MINUTE? OKAY. - DUTCH, YOU'RE REALLY RUSHING SO THAT YOU CAN GET AS MUCH DONE WHILE THE MODELS ARE IN THE POSE. - WHILE THEY'RE IN POSITION. - YES. - IT'S LIKE WATCHING A LIVE OPERATION. SO WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR YOU GUYS? - REALLY, JUST MAKING SURE THAT OUR MODELS AREN'T COMPLETELY BURNT OUT AND CRAMPING... - THAT'S THE BEST ANSWER. - AND TIRED AT THE END. SO WE'RE GIVING 'EM BREAKS. WE'VE ALREADY HAD A BODY BREAK. WE'VE HAD A FOOD BREAK. - FOOD BREAK. - WE'VE HAD WATER BREAKS, AND THEY GET STRETCH BREAKS EVERY FIVE MINUTES. - RIGHT ON. - THIS IS THE LAST CHALLENGE BEFORE THE FINAL CHALLENGE. - YEAH. - HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THAT? - I'M STARTING TO FEEL THE NERVES A LITTLE MORE. I ACTUALLY HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE SLEEPING LAST NIGHT. - ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT THE $100,000 AT ALL? - YEAH, I GOT TWO LITTLE GIRLS I GOTTA PUT THROUGH COLLEGE, SO YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT. - RIGHT. - THERE YOU GO, DADDY. - WELL, GOOD LUCK, DUTCH, AND THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TOO, FELLE. - HEY, IT FEELS GOOD TO BE BACK. I'M HAPPY. - CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. - GOOD. - I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT IN LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM, I DO NOTICE THERE'S A LOT OF FLAT WALLS AND JUST TIERING OF PEOPLE. I'M NOT SEEING A LOT OF INTERWEAVING TO CREATE SHAPES. AND I'M THINKING, GOSH, WHAT A WASTE OF SUPPLIES. I MEAN, THEY'RE SUPPLYING US WITH THESE PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE SHAPES FOR US THAT THEN WE CAN PAINT ON. WE WON'T MAKE YOU HOLD THIS LONG, GUYS, PROMISE. OH, THAT LOOKS AWESOME. - [grunts] - 30 MINUTES, GUYS! 30 MINUTES LEFT. - YOU OKAY? - UH-HUH. BREATHE. THIS IS JUST POWDER. - PAINTING THE BOTTOMS OF THE FEET IS GONNA BE ULTRA, ULTRA TRICKY. I'M ALMOST THINKING, DUDE, WE GRAB SOME WHITE FOAM, TRACE THEIR FEET, AND GLUE 'EM ON THEIR-- - GLUE 'EM ON THEIR FEET, RIGHT. - YEAH. - [sighs] I'M REALLY HOPING WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO FINISH THIS. I REALLY HAVE TO KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK TODAY, OR I'M GONNA GO HOME. HEY, GUYS, 15 MINUTES LEFT! - WHAT? ARE YOU SERIOUS? - WHAT COLOR DO YOU THINK THE TOOTHPICK SHOULD BE? WOOD COLORED? - NO, IT'S GOTTA BE GREEN, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA BE AWAY FROM THE BLUES AND THE BROWNS. JUST--JUST MAKE IT WORK. - MAYBE I'M A LITTLE INSANE. YOU'RE PAINTING A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH. THIS COULD BE REALLY BAD. - FIVE MINUTES LEFT! - ONE MINUTE LEFT. - TIME IS UP. PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN! OKAY, I'M NOT SURE YOU'RE ALL FINISHED, BUT I HOPE YOU ARE. IT'S HARD TO TELL. PAINTERS AND MODELS, ARE YOU READY FOR THE ELIMINATION STAGE? - YES! all: YES. - OKAY, FOLLOW ME. - I GOTTA GO BIG-- YOU KNOW, GO BIG OR GO HOME, 'CAUSE I HAVE NOT WON A CONCEPT CHALLENGE YET. - WELCOME, PAINTERS. - HELLO. - FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WERE GIVEN SIX HOURS TO TACKLE ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT SKILLS IN BODY PAINTING-- MULTI-BODY ILLUSION. YOU ALL KNOW OUR ESTEEMED JUDGES-- CRAIG TRACY... - HELLO, PAINTERS. - ROBIN SLONINA... - HI! - RUPAUL CHARLES... - HELLO. - AND OUR VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE FOR THIS CHALLENGE, THE ARTIST BEHIND SOME OF THE MOST ICONIC BODY PAINTINGS EVER, JOANNE GAIR. - CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU ALL. - THANK YOU, JOANNE. all: THANK YOU. - LET THE MAGIC SHOW BEGIN. LIGHTS OUT! - RIGHT NOW, I HAVE NO ROOM FOR MISTAKES. IT'S JUDGMENT DAY. [applause] [imitates wind blowing] IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED IT TO LOOK LIKE-- AN ANIMATED FILM WITH AMELIA EARHART FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. [applause] - NICOLE'S CONSTRUCT, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF A LITTLE KID'S COLORING BOOK. I THINK IT'S A MESS. [cheers and applause] - GREAT JOB! [applause] [techno music] ♪ ♪ - THE LIGHTS COME ON, AND IT'S THIS BEAUTIFUL, ALMOST COMPLETE FACE. THE WOMAN BECOMES THE EAR. [applause] WHEN THE WHOLE THING IS TOGETHER, IT LOOKS BRILLIANT. I'M SO HAPPY WITH THIS PIECE. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE EARNED MY PLACE IN THIS COMPETITION. ♪ ♪ - SURPRISE, SURPRISE, DUTCH DID A SKULL. - I'VE GOT A MULTITUDE OF EXPRESSIONS THAT I'M SHOWING IN ONE SOLID PAINT. IT'S LITERALLY ANIMATED. LOOK RIGHT. ANGRY EYES. [applause] AND EXCITED EYES. THE JUDGES--THEY'RE JUST SMILES ACROSS THE BOARD, AND I COULDN'T BE MORE PLEASED. [cheers and applause] - I LOVE THE WAY THAT MINE LOOKS. THEY ARE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH I'VE EVER SEEN. - WHEN I SEE NATALIE'S PIECE, I'M JUST BLOWN AWAY. BUT I'M NOT SURE WHAT PART NATALIE PAINTED. THE BREAD IS VERY, VERY GEAR, AND THE BREAD IS 60% OF THE COMPOSITION. [applause] - WHOO! - [laughs] - ALL RIGHT. - WELL, GUYS, WE CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT YOUR PAINTINGS. SHANNON, YOU'RE UP FIRST. - MM. - FOXY LADY, OUT OF SIGHT. - THANK YOU. - CHOICE OF POSE IS BRILLIANT. BUT THERE'S SOME DETAILS THAT YOU COULD HAVE ADDED THAT I'M NOT SEEING. - I LOVE IT THAT THE MODEL'S TUFT OF WHITE HAIR BECAME THE TUFT OF HAIR ON YOUR FOX. - SHANNON, THIS IS EXCEPTIONAL. I KNOW THAT FUR IS ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TO DO IN PAINTING. - THIS IS WHAT I AM MEANT TO DO. I'M HERE TO SEE HOW FAR I CAN GO. - THANKS FOR SHARING THAT WITH US, SHANNON. DUTCH, YOU'RE UP. - DUTCH, I THINK YOU DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB HERE. THE MODEL LAYING OVER BACKWARDS, IT'S STRIKING. THIS IS VERY ORIGINAL. - THE EYES MOVING-- ALL OF THAT IS SO FUN. - TO ME, I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU PAINTED ON PAPER, YOU KNOW, UNDERNEATH. - EXACTLY. I HATE THE FACT THAT YOU BROUGHT IN THAT BOTTOM NOT ON THE BODY ELEMENT. - SURE. - BUT ALL IN ALL, I JUST ADMIRE THE SCULPTURAL QUALITY... - MM-HMM. - THAT YOU CREATED. - AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO SEE YOUR PERSONALITY COME OUT. YOU KNOW? IS IT A LITTLE TOO LATE? I DON'T KNOW. - IT'S NOT EASY FOR ME, GIVEN MY PERSONALITY, TO OPEN UP. I CAME IN HERE ALL COCKSURE AND HEADSTRONG, THINKING THAT I WAS GONNA JUST DOMINATE, AND--AND IT HASN'T BEEN THE CASE. - APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTY. - THANK YOU. - OKAY, NICOLE, YOU'RE UP. - NICOLE, IT'S A DELIGHTFUL PIECE. IT'S GOT A LOT OF PERSONALITY IN IT, AND IT DEFINITELY IS YOUR PERSONALITY THAT SHINES THROUGH. - YOU LET THEM HAVE IT WITH THAT ASS UP IN THAT PAINTING, DIDN'T YOU? I LOVE THAT. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YOU KNOW, THE FACT THAT THE SCARF IS LIGHT BLUE, THE SAME COLOR AS THE SKY BEHIND IT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE GONNA MAKE THAT CHOICE, AT LEAST IF YOU HAD MADE A STRONG BLACK LINE, YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD HAVE HELPED THAT ILLUSION. - I HAVE GROWN SO MUCH OVER THIS COMPETITION. I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA BE AN UNSTOPPABLE BODY PAINTER AFTER I GET FINISHED. - THANK YOU, NICOLE. - THANK YOU. - OKAY, NATALIE, IT'S YOUR TURN. - NATALIE, THE SANDWICH IS FULL OF LOVE. IT REALLY SHOWS IT. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. - I HAVE TO ADMIT, I DID NOT GET THIS AT ALL. WHAT I--WHEN IT CAME ACROSS, I WAS LIKE, "WHAT AM I LOOKING AT? IS THAT LAVA?" - I KNOW IT'S WEIRD, AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE, A SANDWICH IS LIKE, WHAT THE HELL IS SHE THINKING? BUT THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING. I WAS THINKING LIKE, I ALWAYS GO WEIRD WITH IT, WHY STOP NOW? - I'M CURIOUS ABOUT YOU AND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO RISE TO THAT PLACE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING A BRILLIANT IMAGINATION. - WHEN I WAS IN ART SCHOOL, I ACTUALLY CREATED A PIECE OF ART MYSELF CALLED LIVING ON PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY. - I REMEMBER BEING IN ART SCHOOL, BROKE AS A JOKE, AND I ATE A TON OF PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICHES. BUT HEY, THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU'VE COME FROM THAT MOMENT, YOU KNOW? LIKE, THINK ABOUT YOUR PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY TIMES TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW. - YOU'VE GOT A REALLY STRONG PIECE BUT A LITTLE SAFE ON THE POSE. I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MINIMIZED THAT BLUE. AND IT'S THE BACKGROUND. - THANK YOU, NATALIE. GUYS, THIS WAS, BY FAR, THE MOST IMPACTFUL SHOW YET, AND THE JUDGES HAVE A LOT TO DISCUSS. EVERYONE'S GONNA HAVE A LITTLE CHITCHAT, AND THEN WE'LL CALL YOU BACK. - SO, GUYS, THESE PAINTERS DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB WITH THIS MULTI-BODY CHALLENGE. - I CONTINUE TO BE SURPRISED BY WHAT THEY BRING TO THE TABLE. - WELL, WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT DUTCH? - I THINK THAT HE SHOWED SO MUCH CREATIVITY WITH THE BEAUTIFUL SCULPTURAL POSITIONING... - MM-HMM. - OF HIS FIVE BODIES. AND THEN THE FUN, THE EYES, AND ALSO THE LITTLE CABLE COMING OUT. YOU KNOW, JUST ANOTHER LITTLE TOUCH. - IT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER SEEN HIM USE, NOT ONLY HIS SKILL, BUT HIS SENSE OF HUMOR AND HIS IMAGINATION ALL IN TANDEM. - IT BOTHERED ME THAT HE BROUGHT OUT THE PAPER AND DIDN'T USE THE FEET. - IT WAS A LITTLE BIT FLAT. BRINGING THAT LITTLE BIT OF SHADING WOULD HAVE MADE A MORE DIMENSIONAL PIECE. - AND WHAT'D YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT SHANNON? - THAT FOX WAS ADORABLE. - AND THE COMPOSITION WAS TRICKY. - SHE UTILIZED HER MODEL'S UNIQUE ABILITY TO PUT BOTH OF HIS LEGS BEHIND HIS BACK. - THE THINGS THAT SHE DIDN'T DO THAT COULD'VE MADE THAT PAINTING BETTER WERE JUST ADDING IN SOME LITTLE DARKS THAT WOULD'VE HELPED BLEND IN THE NATURAL CURVES WHERE TWO BODIES COME TOGETHER. - I WISH THAT SHE HAD BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE ATTENTIVE ABOUT PULLING THAT ONE MODEL'S ARM DOWN. YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE THE POSITION WAS SO CLOSE TO BEING PERFECT. - THE FINAL POLISHING BITS. - THEY'RE SMALL THINGS, BUT THEY MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. - RIGHT. - AND WHAT'D YOU THINK ABOUT NATALIE? - NATALIE WAS A SUPERSTAR ALSO. I LOVE THAT SANDWICH. I LOVE THE NOSTALGIC TOUCH SHE GAVE IT. - BUT THAT BLUE DISTRACTED ME. I WAS PAYING TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE SPACE. - I THOUGHT THE BLUE WAS A LITTLE ODD, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS ABSTRACT, AND I BOUGHT IT. - WHAT I LOVED ABOUT NATALIE'S WORK WAS IT'S OUT OF THE BOX TO PUT TOGETHER A COMPOSITION OF BODIES THAT ALL ACTUALLY HAD LANGUAGE. - BUT WHEN YOU'RE GIVEN MODELS THAT CAN GET INTO ALL THESE CRAZY POSITIONS, YOU KNOW, WAS IT A LITTLE BIT TOO SAFE? - WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT NICOLE? - I LOVE NICOLE, AND I LOVE HER AESTHETIC. IT'S FUN. IT'S SHOWBIZ. THE VAUDEVILLE CARNIVAL, HER PIECES ALWAYS MAKE ME SMILE. - AND SHE MADE IT FLASHY EVEN WITHOUT THE GLITTER. - SHE DID NOT PUT GLITTER IN THIS, DID SHE? - NO GLITTER. - WAS THERE NO GLITTER ON THIS? - [gasps] - BUT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BOLDER IN HER POSES USING THESE MODELS TO THE LEVEL THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE OF. - I THINK NICOLE TOOK THE IDEA OF A FLAT SURFACE TOO LITERALLY. - THERE WERE SOME TECHNICAL PROBLEMS WITH IT. THE HAIR LOOKED A LITTLE STRANGE TO ME, LIKE KIND OF A TENDRIL. HER SCARF WAS THE SAME COLOR AS THE SKY BEHIND IT, WHICH WAS VERY CONFUSING TO THE EYE. AND THE GOGGLES WERE SO FUN AND SUCH A CUTE IDEA, BUT THE SCALE WAS OFF. - THEY NEEDED A MODEL WITH A BIG, FAT ASS. - SO I KNOW THIS IS A TOUGH ONE, BUT HAVE YOU GUYS COME TO YOUR DECISION? - YEAH. - I THINK SO. - YEAH. - PAINTERS, YOU WERE GIVEN THE NEAR IMPOSSIBLE TASK OF CREATING A MULTIPLE-BODY ILLUSION IN ONLY SIX HOURS. YOU PROVED WHY YOU ARE THE FINAL FOUR. UNFORTUNATELY TONIGHT, FOUR BECOMES THREE. SURVIVING THIS CHALLENGE MEANS YOU WILL BE IN THE FINALS READY TO COMPETE FOR THE $100,000 GRAND PRIZE AND THE TITLE OF SKIN WARS CHAMPION. SHANNON, DUTCH, PLEASE STEP FORWARD. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE THE TOP TWO. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - YOU WILL BOTH BE MOVING ON TO THE FINALS. - I TOTALLY DESERVE TO BE GOING INTO THE FINALS. MY MOM IS PRAYING THAT I WIN THE ENTIRE THING. I'M REALLY, REALLY GRATEFUL AND PROUD. - SHANNON, THE JUDGES LOVED YOUR FOX. YOU CREATED AN INCREDIBLY REALISTIC LOOK, AND THE JUDGES COULD REALLY FEEL YOUR PERSONAL PASSION IN THE PIECE. DUTCH, YOU CREATED A REAL "WOW" MOMENT WHEN YOUR SKULL'S EYES CAME TO LIFE. AND ONCE AGAIN, YOU PROVED YOU ARE THE MASTER OF DETAIL WITH THE WAY YOU TURNED YOUR MODEL'S HAIR INTO EYES. YOU BOTH DID AN EXTRAORDINARY JOB, BUT THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE WINNER. THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... DUTCH. CONGRATULATIONS! - I KIND OF FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN TAKING SECOND PLACE ON JUST ABOUT EVERY CHALLENGE. IT'S REALLY NICE TO FINALLY COME AWAY WITH A VICTORY. - DUTCH, YOU HAVE BEEN STORING THIS ABILITY INSIDE OF YOURSELF, AND IT'S FINALLY SURFACED, AND WE'RE THRILLED TO SEE IT. - OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. [laughs] - I'M VERY PROUD OF BOTH OF YOU. YOUR WINGS ARE THOROUGHLY SPREAD. - SHANNON, DUTCH, CONGRATULATIONS. WE WILL SEE YOU IN THE FINALS. - THE $100,000, FOR ME, IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL. AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT TO THE FINISH FOR MY DAUGHTERS. - YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - BYE. - CONGRATULATIONS. - I TOTALLY DESERVE TO BE GOING INTO THE FINALS. A DOOR HAS BEEN OPENED. MY OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITLESS. [suspenseful music] - NATALIE, NICOLE, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU ARE THE BOTTOM TWO. - I'M ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME, I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING HOME. - NATALIE, NICOLE, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU ARE THE BOTTOM TWO. ONLY ONE OF YOU WILL BE MOVING ON TO THE FINALS. - I'VE COME SO, SO FAR, AND I WOULD JUST HATE TO GO HOME TONIGHT. - NATALIE, THE JUDGES LIKED THAT YOU PUSHED YOURSELF BY ATTEMPTING REALISM. BUT YOU TOOK A HUGE RISK PICKING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A SANDWICH AS YOUR SUBJECT, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ALSO CHOSE SUCH A SIMPLE POSE. NICOLE, THE JUDGES LOVED YOUR CONCEPT AND THE MOVEMENT OF YOUR PIECE, BUT THE PROPORTIONS WERE OFF. THE JUDGES WISHED THAT YOUR USE OF THE MODELS' BODIES WAS LESS LIKE A FLAT CANVAS AND HAD MORE DIMENSION. [suspenseful music] THE THIRD PAINTER MOVING ON TO THE FINALS IS... NATALIE. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU ARE LIKE A CAT WITH NINE LIVES. - RIGHT? - [laughs] - [sighs] - OUR DAY WOULDN'T BE COMPLETE WITHOUT SOME NATALIE TEARS. YOU MAY HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - I WON'T [bleep] UP, I PROMISE. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. - THAT MEANS, NICOLE, I'M SORRY, BUT YOUR JOURNEY ENDS HERE. - YOU PAINTED REALLY WELL, BUT WE'RE AT THIS PLACE NOW WHERE THESE LITTLE BITTY DECISIONS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. - I'M SUPER THANKFUL FOR THIS WHOLE OPPORTUNITY. I'M GOING HOME PROUD OF MYSELF. THE ARTWORK THAT I CREATED HERE IS DEFINITELY SOME OF THE BEST ARTWORK I'VE DONE PROBABLY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. - I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOUR ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT AND TALENT HAVE IN STORE FOR THE WORLD. - LOTS OF GLITTER. - LOTS OF GLITTER, OF COURSE. - I HOPE SO. - OF COURSE. - NICOLE, PLEASE GO WASH OFF YOUR CANVAS. - BYE-BYE. MY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT ABOUT BEING ELIMINATED TODAY IS THAT I DON'T GET TO PROVE MYSELF IN THE FINAL CHALLENGE, YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S A HUGE HEARTBREAKER. I HAVE GROWN SO MUCH AS A BODY PAINTER. I HAVEN'T EVEN PICKED UP AN AIRBRUSH OUTSIDE OF THIS COMPETITION. TONIGHT, I HAD A 25% CHANCE OF WINNING $100,000. IT ABSOLUTELY SLIPPED THROUGH MY FINGERS. - NEXT TIME ON SKIN WARS... WE'RE DOWN TO THE FINAL THREE. - OH, MY GOD. - IT'S GONNA BE A BATTLE TOMORROW, THAT'S FOR SURE. - DUTCH IS TRYING TO SAY, "I DID NOT COME HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS." - YEP. I CAME HERE TO WIN SKIN WARS. - IN CASE THE $100,000 GRAND PRIZE ISN'T ENOUGH, WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA INSPIRATION. - ARE YOU KIDDING ME? - [laughs] - REALLY, REALLY WANNA WIN. I JUST HAVE TO. - OH, BOY. IF I REALLY JUST DO ME, ARE THE JUDGES GONNA LIKE IT? - THIS IS TERRIFYING. - WHAT THE [bleep]? - TOOLS DOWN! - WHO SHOWED US THE BEST PAINTINGS? - THE FIRST-EVER SKIN WARS CHAMPION IS... - ONE OF US IS GOING HOME $100,000 RICHER.
