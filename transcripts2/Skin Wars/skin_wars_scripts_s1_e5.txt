 FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL BE WORKING IN TEAMS. I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU ALL LOVE WORKING IN TEAMS. - [laughs] - HMM. - IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GRAB ME TRUSTY PAINT CAN. LET'S DO THIS. THE FIRST TWO NAMES I PICK WILL BE TEAM ONE. SHANNON AND GEAR. - YEAH. - TEAM TWO-- DUTCH AND NATALIE. - OH, BOY. SHE'S A SCORPIO. I'M A LEO. I'M A MAN. SHE'S A WOMAN. SHE'S EMOTIONAL, I'M NOT. THIS COULD BE BAD. - YAY. [laughs] - AND THAT MEANS, NICOLE AND FELLE, YOU TWO ARE TEAM THREE. - I GOTTA GET USED TO THIS GLITTER THING NOW. YOU KNOW, NICOLE IS A GLITTER GIRL. I DON'T LOOK AT HER AS A STRONG PARTNER FOR ME. - I SAW HOW HARD IT WAS FOR SHANNON TO WORK WITH FELLE. I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. - PLEASE MEET YOUR INSPIRATION FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE. - OH, NICE. - OH, MY GOSH! - WOW! - OH, MY GOD! - ALL RIGHT, YEAH! - YEAH. - OH, IT'S AN IGUANA. - ALLOW ME TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SALSA THE PARROT, FELICIA THE LEMUR, AND IGGY THE IGUANA. - AW. - AW. [upbeat calypso music] - EACH TEAM MUST CREATE ONE PAINTING THAT REFLECTS THE LOOK, MOVEMENT AND SPIRIT OF YOUR ANIMAL. SHANNON AND GEAR, SINCE YOU WERE THE FIRST TEAM TO BE CHOSEN, YOU GET TO PICK YOUR INSPIRATION FIRST. - I'VE PAINTED IGUANAS BEFORE. - OKAY, COOL. ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE ARE GONNA CHOOSE THE IGUANA. - IGGY IS YOURS. DUTCH AND NATALIE. - COLOR? - YEAH, WE'LL GO FOR THE COLOR, DEFINITELY. - WE'RE GOING WITH SALSA. - SALSA. THAT MEANS, FELLE AND NICOLE, YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH FELICIA THE LEMUR. EACH TEAM WILL HAVE TWO HOURS TO PAINT ONE HEAD-TO-TOE, FRONT-TO-BACK CREATURE CREATION. - WHOA. I'M STOKED, 'CAUSE I HAVE A REAL ANIMAL RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, BUT TWO HOURS IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DO THIS. - THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE WILL GET A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR THE UPCOMING CONCEPT CHALLENGE. - EXTRA POINTS IF YOU INCORPORATE POO INTO YOUR PIECE. - EW. - YES! - YOU GUYS READY TO GET WILD WITH THIS? - YES. - OH, YEAH. - THE CLOCK STARTS NOW. - GOOD LUCK, EVERYBODY. - THIS WING COMES ALL THE WAY DOWN LIKE THIS. - IT'S FUN TO HAVE ANIMALS IN THE ROOM. DUTCH AND SALSA SUPER RESEMBLE EACH OTHER. [laughs] - BIRD, BIRD. - I'M KEEPING MY EYE ON THE THING THAT I THINK IS A LEMUR, LIMER. ONLY LIMER I'M FAMILIAR WITH IS LIMER BEANS IN DETROIT. IF HE JUMPS, I'M OUTTA HERE. - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? THAT IS IGGY. I HAVEN'T WON JACK[bleep] AT THIS POINT. I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN A LITTLE UNDERAPPRECIATED. - I'M GONNA USE YOUR HIP BONE AS THE ELBOW. - SHANNON AND I, OUR ARTISTIC STYLES ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER. IT CAN EITHER REALLY WORK OR REALLY CLASH. - OKAY, SO TWO PARROTS ON EACH SIDE. HAVE, ACTUALLY, THE FEET RIGHT HERE, LIKE THEY'RE STANDING ON THE COLLAR BONES. - AND THEN THE TAILS COME DOWN HERE? - THE TAILS COMING DOWN HERE. - DUTCH IS TECHNICALLY AMAZING. AND I HAVE SOME REALLY COOL, WEIRD IDEAS SOMETIMES. AND SO LET'S TRY AND MARRY THE TWO OF THOSE. I KNOW THIS IS KINDA SILLY, BUT AS FAR AS THE FEET, I THINK WE SHOULD DO BIRD [bleep]. - OKAY. - RU IS LIKE, "BONUS POINTS IF YOU CAN INCORPORATE POO INTO YOUR PAINTING." CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. [laughs] - I WAS THINKING OF MAKING A HOOD WITH THE EARS ON IT. - MM-HMM. NICOLE'S SKETCH, IT'S LOOKING LIKE A CAVEMAN OUTFIT. I REALLY CAN'T GET COMFORTABLE FOLLOWING THAT LEAD. I WAS THINKING ABOUT TAKING THE FOAM AND CREATING THE LEMUR. - BUT THAT'S VERY LITERAL. FELLE'S CONCEPT IS TOTALLY LITERAL, NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO AT ALL. - I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT UP IN MAKING AN OUTFIT. - YEAH. BUT I CAN'T SPEND 15 MINUTES ARGUING, SO I CAVE IN AND I SAY THAT WE CAN DO FELLE'S FOAM LEMUR SITTING ON THE SHOULDER OF OUR MODEL. - I'M GONNA HAVE TO ATTACH PROBABLY TO YOUR EAR OR SOMETHING. - NIGHTMARE. NIGHTMARE! - SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A PROSTHETIC FOR HER FACE, FOR HER MOUTH AND-- - WELL, I THINK WE SHOULD DO BLACK LIPS AND BLACK AROUND HER EYES AND STUFF, INSTEAD OF, YOU KNOW, MAKING HER INTO A LITERAL LEMUR FACE. - I GOTCHA. - I AM GONNA START COLOR-BLOCKING IN THAT KINDA COPPERISH TAIL. YES? - UM, YEAH. - I STARTED TO ADD DETAIL AND GEAR IS NOT SUPER PLEASED WITH WHAT I'VE DONE. - START BLOCKING IN THIS BODY, JUST BLOCK-- - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU DO. HE GETS A LITTLE BIT EXASPERATED. - [sighs] GO AHEAD AND JUST FREAK IT, AND I'LL JUST START WORKING WITH IT. - I DON'T GET IT. - WHAT IF WE DID A WATERFALL ON THE BACK? - WHATEVER. I JUST DON'T WANNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT IT. LIKE, WHATEVER WE'RE GONNA DO, LET'S DO IT. NICOLE DECIDES TO GO AROUND THE BACK AND START PAINTING A WATERFALL. I'M OKAY WITH THAT. I WANT NICOLE OUT OF MY WAY SO I CAN ATTEMPT TO DO MY THING. THIS PROSTHETIC STUFF IS AMAZING. I'M JUST RIDING WITH MY VISION OF USING A PROSTHETIC TO MAKE MY MODEL A LEMUR. SWEET. - I AM COMPLETELY LOST IN MY PAINTING, AND I TURN AROUND AND SEE THAT FELLE HAS PUT THIS HORRENDOUS PROSTHETIC ON THE MOUTH OF OUR MODEL. DIDN'T ASK ME AT ALL. HE JUST PUT IT ON THERE. I GIVE UP. I DECIDE TO JUST DO SOMETHING GREAT ON THE BACK SO THAT I'M NOT HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT HIDEOUS FACE. [upbeat dance music] - LOOK. - YES. MORE SOLID TOWARDS THE CENTER. - SHOW ME WHAT HE WANT. - TRIMMIN' DOWN YOUR BUSH. I PAINTED THE NEST AND LEFT, LIKE, AN EMPTY SPACE FOR DUTCH TO PAINT THE BABY BIRDS. ALL RIGHT, DUTCH, NINE MINUTES, BABY BIRDS. - ALL RIGHT, I'M COMING AROUND THE FRONT IN A SEC. - WE CAN ALSO JUST DO EGGS IF YOU DON'T HAVE TIME. - NO, NO. I'LL DO IT. I'LL DO IT. NATALIE IS GETTING ANXIOUS, BUT I COULD BANG OUT THESE CHICKS IN NO TIME FLAT. - I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEIR TEETH LOOK LIKE. I WANT TO ADD THE MOST DRAMA TO OUR REPRESENTATION OF THIS IGUANA, SO I'M GOING TO PAINT ON SOME DRAGON-ESQUE TEETH JUST TO GIVE THAT EXTRA POW. DO THEY HAVE SHARP TEETH? - NOT REALLY. - THEY'RE VEGETARIANS. - BUT THEY'RE KIND OF LIKE POINTED? - YES. - FIVE MORE MINUTES, EVERYBODY! FINAL TOUCH-UP. - BLOW THOSE LITTLE TEARS AWAY. - [laughs] - THERE'S NO CRYING IN BODY PAINT! - WE'RE GONNA HAVE TROUBLE WITH THIS. - ARE WE? - THERE REALLY IS NO PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN NICOLE AND I. SHE JUST SAID, "TO HELL WITH IT," AND JUMPED ON THE MODEL'S BACK, LIKE, "I'M GONNA DO MY THING AND LET HIM DO HIS THING AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY." YOU KNOW, WE HAVE CLUES. AT THIS POINT, WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO TRY TO FIGURE THINGS OUT. - CLOSE YOUR EYE TIGHT. TIGHT. SQUISH, SQUISH, SQUISH. - IT'S, LIKE, CLOSE TO YOUR HAIR. I KNOW. WHATEVER. [timer beeps] - OKAY, PAINTERS! TIME IS UP. PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. - TIME'S UP. WE'RE SCREWED. - WOW. I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU GUYS GOT DONE IN TWO HOURS. - SEVERE. IT'S SEVERE UP IN HERE. - [laughs] - HI, DUTCH. HI, NATALIE. - HI. - HELLO. - HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. GOOD. - WAIT A MINUTE. I ISSUED A CHALLENGE-- EXTRA POINTS IF YOU USED POO... - WHOO-HOO! - AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU GUYS ACCEPTED. - WE ACCEPTED. - CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. - ACCEPTED! - I LOVE IT. - SO THIS IS MOTHER AND FATHER UP TOP OVER THEIR BABY BIRDS. - IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN BABY PARROTS, THEY ARE THE CUTEST UGLY THINGS YOU'VE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFE. - WOW. - YOU DEFINITELY CAPTURED CUTE AND UGLY. - WANNA DO A TWIRL FOR US? all: OOH. - THIS IS SALSA. - THAT'S SALSA. - OKAY. THANKS, GUYS. both: THANK YOU. - LOOK AT FELICIA UP THERE. - WOW. SHE'S JUST A SHOW PONY, ISN'T SHE? - YEAH. - WE DECIDED TO DO TWO LEMURS ON TOP AND THEN THE ENVIRONMENT BELOW, AND ON THE BACK, DID A LOVELY WATERFALL. - AND THERE'S GLITTER! - AND THERE'S GLITTER! GUESS WHO DID THE BACK. - NOW, HOW DID YOU TWO WORK TOGETHER? - SHE WAS DOING HER THING. I WAS DOING MY THING. YOU KNOW, WE HAD SO LITTLE TIME. - I ACTUALLY HAD A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAT I WANTED TO GO... - RIGHT. - INSPIRED BY THE--THE FUR. - DID HE GIVE YOU A HARD TIME ABOUT THAT? - WE--WE BOTH HAD OUR IDEAS HASHED OUT, BUT WE DEFINITELY HAD TO AGREE ON SOMETHING AND JUST GET IT DONE. - WOW! - OOH. - YOUR MODEL'S WORKIN' IT. - MM-HMM. - MM-HMM, YES. - LOOK AT THOSE LEGS MOVE. WAS IGGY MODELING THIS WELL FOR YOU THE ENTIRE TIME YOU WERE PAINTING? - IGGY WAS A PERFECT MODEL. - YES, PERFECTLY STILL. - IGGY IS A WAY BETTER MODEL THAN I EVER WAS. JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. - AND ARE THOSE TEETH ANATOMICALLY CORRECT? - WE WANTED HIM TO BE REALLY EXPRESSIVE. SO WE WANTED TO SHOW THE DRAMATIC TEETH. - OKAY. - SO LET'S TALK ABOUT DUTCH AND NATALIE. - YOU KNOW, WITH HIS TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND HER CREATIVITY, IT WAS LIKE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN. - AND THEN THEY INCORPORATED POOP. - I KNOW, IT'S SO LIKE NATALIE TO TAKE A JOKE AND, LIKE, INCORPORATE IT IN. - YEAH. - YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A JOKE-- OF COURSE SOMEBODY'S GETTING EXTRA POINTS FOR THAT-- BUT SHE'S JUST SUCH A HUMOROUS PAINTER. - OKAY, LET'S TALK ABOUT GEAR AND SHANNON. - I LOOKED AT THAT IGUANA AND I THOUGHT, A FASHION DESIGN PRINT. I COULD SEE A GORGEOUS GOWN MADE OUT OF THAT. - DO YOU KNOW WHAT DID BOTHER ME ABOUT THAT PIECE WAS-- IT'S THE TEETH. HE WENT FROM IGGY TO GODZILLA. - I HAVE TO AGREE. THE TEETH SEEMED CARTOONISH. - HOW ABOUT NICOLE AND FELLE? - LOOKING AT THE OVERALL COMPOSITION, WHAT CONFUSED ME WAS THEN THE FACE IS A SECOND LEMUR, BUT THEN, WHERE'S THE BODY? AND THE LITTLE GUY ON THE SHOULDER, IT IS OBVIOUS THAT IT'S JUST A BENDY PIECE OF CARDBOARD. - THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD EACH DO THEIR OWN THING. AND THEN, FINGERS AND TOES CROSSED, THAT ULTIMATELY IT WOULD ALL COME TOGETHER. - JUST DIDN'T QUITE COME TOGETHER FOR ME. - RIGHT. - SO HAVE YOU MADE UP YOUR MIND? - I THINK SO. - YEAH. - OKAY, PAINTERS, TIME TO FIND OUT WHICH TEAM'S CREATURE WAS LIVELY ENOUGH TO TAKE THE TOP SPOT. THE WINNERS OF THIS CHALLENGE ARE... - THIS WAS A REALLY TOUGH DECISION FOR RU AND ROBIN, BUT IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHICH TEAM'S CREATURE WAS LIVELY ENOUGH TO TAKE THE TOP SPOT. THE WINNERS OF THIS CHALLENGE ARE NATALIE AND DUTCH. - GOOD JOB, YOU GUYS. - GOOD JOB. - GOOD JOB. - BIG SURPRISE. - THANK YOU. - CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS. both: THANK YOU. YOU JUST WON A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR THE NEXT CONCEPT CHALLENGE. - AWESOME. - FIRST MINI CHALLENGE TO WIN. SUPER EXCITED. I CANNOT WAIT TO HEAR WHAT MY ADVANTAGE IS. - YOU KNOCKED IT OUT OF THE PARK WITH CREATIVITY, DETAIL, HUMOR, AND IT'S SO MUCH FUN. - EVERYBODY DID A GREAT JOB WITH THE TIME YOU HAD, SO CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYONE. WELL DONE. all: THANK YOU. - AND THANK YOU, MODELS. YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO YOUR NATURAL HABITAT NOW. - THANK YOU! - WHOO! AWESOME, MODELS! WHOO! - FOR THIS TEAM CONCEPT CHALLENGE-- THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID, "TEAM." - OH, MY GOD, I BETTER NOT BE ON A TEAM WITH FELLE. - YOU WILL HAVE FIVE HOURS TO CREATE A GROUP OF MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES. - HELL YEAH. - YOU WILL BE WORKING IN TEAMS OF THREE. EACH TEAM WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THREE PAINTINGS, AND THESE PAINTINGS MUST COME TOGETHER TO TELL A STORY. - I'M STOKED. I'M ECSTATIC, ACTUALLY, 'CAUSE IT'S RIGHT UP MY ALLEY. I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES. - NATALIE AND DUTCH, YOU'VE PROVEN AS A TEAM YOU CAN CREATE MAGIC. NOW, YOU GET TO TURN YOUR PAIR INTO A THREESOME. - AND WHO DOESN'T LOVE A THREESOME? - NO ONE. - WORD UP, NICKI MENAGE A TROIS. - I LOVE IT WHEN YOU SPEAK FRENCH. - YEAH. - THAT'S RIGHT, YOUR ADVANTAGE. YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHICH THIRD PAINTER YOU WANT TO ADD TO YOUR ALREADY DOMINANT TEAM. THAT MEANS, WHOEVER YOU DON'T CHOOSE WILL BE YOUR COMPETITION TOMORROW. - I WANNA WORK WITH SHANNON OR GEAR. - SO WHO'S IT GONNA BE? - WE'RE GONNA GO WITH FELLE. - FELLE. - YES. - [sings ethereal note] - THAT MEANS, SHANNON, GEAR, AND NICOLE, YOU ARE A TEAM. - I THINK THIS TEAM ROCKS. - OH, YEAH. - OKAY. - ALL RIGHT, YOU HAVE A LOT TO DO TOMORROW. COME READY FOR ANYTHING, BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL BE REVEALED IN THE LIGHT OF DAY TOMORROW. - UH-OH. - COME ON! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS GONNA BE ABOUT? ONCE AGAIN, THE PLOT THICKENS. - DO YOU GUYS NOT WANT US TO KNOW WHAT YOUR CREATURES ARE? - WE'RE DOING, UM... - NO, SHUT YOUR MOUTH. - OKAY. - THEY DON'T NEED TO KNOW. - THE GENERAL VIBE AROUND THE HOUSE IS A LITTLE MORE STRESSED OUT AND EMOTIONAL THAN USUAL. - FELLE, I HATED THAT FACE PROSTHETIC. I HATED IT! - YOU KNOW, I HATE IT WHEN YOU FIRST GRABBED THE AIRBRUSH, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I NORMALLY DO. - I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT WAS AS COLLABORATIVE AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THE MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN FELLE AND I LOST THE COMPETITION FOR US TODAY. - LET ME TALK TO MY PARTNERS THAT WIN CHALLENGES, AND QUIT TALKIN' TO LOSERS. - FELLE, NOT THE ATTITUDE TO HAVE. - I DIDN'T SAY NOTHIN' WRONG. - FELLE, DON'T--DON'T PULL THAT. WE ALL HAVE WON CHALLENGES. - WE DON'T-- WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW. THAT WASN'T WHAT I WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT. - YOU JUST SAID, "I'M GONNA GO WITH MY TEAM..." - IT WAS A JOKE. - "WHO WIN CHALLENGES." - IT WAS A JOKE, NICOLE. - THAT WASN'T A JOKE. - FELLE'S GONNA HANG IT ALL OUT THERE WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT. HE KNOWS THAT IT'S A COMPETITION, AND HE'S PLAYING THE GAME. [upbeat rock music] ♪ ♪ - HELLO. HOW ARE YOU? - I GET TO WORK WITH YOU TODAY. - I KNOW. - GOING INTO TODAY, I'M FEELING SUPREMELY CONFIDENT. ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN, I WOULD SAY MY GENERAL KNOWLEDGE OF MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES IS PROBABLY ABOUT A NINE. - WHAT ARE WE DOING? - IT'S KINDA HARD TO EXPLAIN. WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING MYTHICAL GODS. OUR CONCEPT CHALLENGE IS TO CREATE MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT MYTHOLOGY SO I'M DEFINITELY AT A DISADVANTAGE, BUT I'M TRUSTING IN MY PARTNERS. - I'M SO EXCITED! - [laughs] - SIREN, PEGASUS... - SIREN-- - DRAGON, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT? - YEAH, I'M GOOD WITH THAT. OUR TEAM'S THE BLONDETOURAGE. - NICOLE, CAN I SEE YOUR SKETCHBOOK REAL QUICK? - YES. WE COME UP WITH A STORY. SHANNON IS DOING THE PEGASUS, AND SHE HAS GOTTEN HER HORN BROKEN OFF BY AN EVIL SIREN, AND I'M DOING THE SIREN. GEAR IS DOING GANNON THE DRAGON, WHO IS OUR HERO OF THE STORY. HE COMES IN AND SAVES THE DAY. LET'S SEE WHAT GEAR THINKS. - I'M GOOD WITH THAT. - EVERYONE IS EXPECTING DUTCH, NATALIE, AND FELLE TO DOMINATE THIS CHALLENGE. BUT WE'RE REALLY GONNA BRING SOMETHING AMAZING TO THE TABLE TODAY. - OKAY, SO YOU GUYS WILL HAVE, LIKE, A GREEK MYTHOLOGY KIND OF STORY FLOWING ACROSS YOUR BACKS. BUT ON THE FRONT, YOU'RE GONNA BE THESE-- YOU'RE GONNA BE THESE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS ON THE FRONT. WE ARE TEAM AWESOME. OUR CONCEPT IS A HERO GOES ON A LONG JOURNEY AND IS CHALLENGED BY CREATURES SENT BY DIFFERENT GODS. SO I'M IN CHARGE OF THE MINOTAUR AND POSEIDON. FELLE IS DOING MEDUSA AND DUTCH'S SKETCH OF HADES. AND THEN DUTCH IS DOING THE 3-HEADED FATES, AND THEN HE ALSO REALLY WANTS TO DO ZEUS. ONE OF US WILL BE DOING YOUR FRONT, AND ONE OF US WILL BE DOING YOUR BACK. SO IT'LL BE--IT'LL SWITCH. WE ALL HAVE A COLOR SCHEME THAT WE'RE GOING FOR, AND WE'RE SWITCHING. - I HAVE A QUESTION. WHY WOULDN'T I DO MEDUSA ON HER BACK? WHY WOULDN'T I JUST DO THE WHOLE THING? - BECAUSE MEDUSA IS HIS ON THE BACK, THE COLOR SCHEME. - OH, OKAY. - REMEMBER? - OKAY. - FELLE, COME ON. IN A TEAM CHALLENGE, WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO EACH OTHER, OR THIS IS NOT GONNA WORK. - I LOVE IT. GO, TEAM. - OKAY. I'M EXCITED. COMING IN WITH SOME SCISSORS. I WON'T CUT YOU, I PROMISE. - OKAY. - ALL RIGHT, DUTCH MASTER. DUTCH, LOOK AT THIS. TOO SMALL? - TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN. - HOW YOU DOIN', SHANNON? - GOOD. - IT'S LOOKIN' PRETTY SWEET, DUDE. - THANK YOU. TODAY, NICOLE IS IN CHARGE OF THE PROPS. GEAR IS GOING TO PAINT THE BACKGROUNDS, AND I'M GOING TO DO THE MURAL. - IF YOU BLOCK IT IN, THEN I COULD GO IN THERE AND GO... [makes funny noise] - WORKING WITH GEAR, THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LANGUAGE BARRIER AT FIRST. WELL, I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT... [makes funny noises] BUT I'M USED TO IT AT THIS POINT. - GO, YOW-OW-OW! - WE'RE GOING BLUES, LIGHT BLUES. - OKAY. - JUST LEAVE THAT GREEN ON. DON'T TAKE IT OFF. - NO, I WON'T TAKE IT OFF. - JUST PUT A LIGHT BLUE OVER IT. - ONE OF THE CRITIQUES THAT I'VE RECEIVED IN THE PAST IS THAT I'M IN THE HABIT OF DOING THE MONOCHROMATIC, AND I'M PAINTING MEDUSA, JUST USING THE BLUE TONES. BUT I FIGURE SINCE IT'S A TEAM CHALLENGE, IF THERE'S AN ISSUE, THE MONOCHROMATIC WAS NOT MY DECISION. - YES. I'M DOING VERY STRATEGIC PLACEMENT OF PROSTHETICS. I MEAN, IT'S GONNA HAVE SOME VISUAL SICKNESS, IF YOU WILL. - PAINTERS. I'M HERE WITH CRAIG TRACY AND ROBIN SLONINA. WE HAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO TELL YOU. THE THING ABOUT MYTHICAL BEINGS IS AT FIRST GLANCE THEY APPEAR TO BE ONE THING, BUT WHEN PUT IN A DIFFERENT LIGHT, THEY REVEAL ANOTHER SIDE OF THEMSELVES. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ADDING ANOTHER LAYER TO THIS CHALLENGE. - THERE IS NOTHING GOOD ABOUT HAVING THIS TWIST. ARE THEY NUTS? ARE THEY ABSOLUTELY NUTS? - WE'RE ADDING ANOTHER LAYER TO THIS CHALLENGE. - WHAT?! - YEAH, BUDDY! - OH, MY GOD. - OH, COOL! - YOU'LL BE USING UV PAINTS TO ENHANCE YOUR CREATURES FOR THE REVEAL ONSTAGE. - ULTRAVIOLET IS ONE OF THE MOST DYNAMIC TECHNIQUES IN BODY PAINTING. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE WHAT YOU COME UP WITH. - THIS COULD GIVE YOUR PAINTS THAT EXTRA PUNCH, SO HAVE FUN WITH IT. - WE KNOW THAT BY SIMPLY PUTTING THE PAINT ON THE BODY IT'S GOING TO GLOW WHEN THE BLACK LIGHT'S ON IT. BUT TO IMPLEMENT THIS, I'M A LITTLE MORE NERVOUS AT THIS POINT. - GOOD LUCK. - THANK YOU. - ON THE AQUATIC PART, I'M GONNA PUT THESE, LIKE, SORT OF LIKE ATLANTEAN, SUMERIAN RUINS, LIKE, SCRIPT--CHH, CHH, CHH-- GLOWING AND THEN BUBBLES, LIKE, UV BUBBLES GLOWING FROM THE BOTTOM, LIKE, COMING UP. THE UV LIGHT, NOT MY FIRST RODEO. ALL THESE IDEAS ARE LIGHTING UP IN MY HEAD. THIS IS MY ARENA. - EACH CHARACTER CAN HAVE SOMETHING SMALL LIKE THAT. - EXACTLY. - GEAR USES UV ALL THE TIME. THE OTHER TEAM IS GONNA KILL US IF WE DON'T STEP IT UP. DAMN, WE SHOULD HAVE PICKED GEAR. - WE JUST HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THE UV TO--FOR OUR CHARACTERS. OKAY? - BUT ON THE BACK-- - I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO INCORPORATE THE BACK. - YEAH, OF COURSE WE DO. - FELLE HAS NO EXPERIENCE IN UV. I'M NOT SURE WHAT NATALIE'S BACKGROUND IS IN UV. SO NOW, WE'RE IN A TIME CRUNCH. THE BACK IS THE MURAL. - I KNOW. - I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MESS WITH IT. - I THINK WE SHOULD USE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT. - I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN PULL THAT OFF EFFECTIVELY. - OKAY. [electronic music] ♪ ♪ - HOW YOU DOIN', NICOLE? - I'M FREAKIN' OUT A LITTLE... - OKAY. - BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TIME. LIKE, MY WHOLE BACK IS OPEN RIGHT NOW. - CAN I HAND-PAINT SOMETHING FOR YOU ON YOUR MODEL? - YEAH, THERE'S FIRE WHERE THE DRAGON IS ON THE BACK. - I TRY TO MAKE MY UNICORN NOT CARTOONY BECAUSE THIS IS SKIN WARS. THIS IS NOT STORYBOOK ILLUSTRATION TIME. BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME TO RENDER THINGS TO LOOK REALISTIC. POP DOWN. DOLCE, WILL YOU PLEASE COME OVER TO ME? - FELLE? - YES. - MY GIRL'S PRETTY MUCH READY. I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE ANY, LIKE, UV ON HER YET. - OKAY. - BUT IF YOU WANNA START THE BACK--BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR BACK, RIGHT? - OKAY. - I TELL THEM WE HAVE TO SAVE THE LAST HOUR TO COMBINE ALL THE GIRLS AND, YOU KNOW, MAKE THAT LOOK LIKE A TAPESTRY. DUTCH TAKES AN HOUR MAKING THOSE HEADS. [sighs] - HEY, DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND A PROSTHETIC SORT OF PIECE THAT WILL BE YOUR BROKEN-OFF HORN ON THE TOP? - ♪ YES ♪ YOU WANT THIS TO BE FIRE, HONEY BUNNY? - YES. ABOVE THE DRAGON? YES. - OKAY, I GOT IT. OKAY. - I LOOK OVER AT DUTCH, FELLE, AND NATALIE. THEY HAVE VERY LITTLE DETAIL. AND IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE WORKING A LOT ON PROSTHETICS INSTEAD OF BODY PAINTING, AND I GET A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFIDENT. - ONE HOUR LEFT. LET'S HUSTLE! - WITH ME NOT KNOWING MUCH ABOUT MYTHOLOGICAL CREATURES, I'M REALLY GOING TO DEPEND ON DUTCH'S SKETCH TO GET THE WIN ON THIS ONE. - WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DOVETAIL AND GET ALL THAT... - YEP. - BLENDING DONE PRETTY QUICK. - I JUST WANTED A LITTLE BIT MORE OVERLAPPING THAN JUST THE COLORS. - I MEAN, IF OUR BACKS AREN'T EVEN COMPLETE-- - I SAY, ONCE EVERYBODY FINISH THEIR BACK, WE PUT 'EM TOGETHER AND WE JUST TIE 'EM IN. - THE COHESIVENESS OF WHAT WE WERE PLANNING TO DO AS A TEAM NOW IS SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL. NATALIE'S PANICKING. - CAN WE COME TOGETHER? I CAN WORK ON SOME OF THE THINGS ON THE FRONT, AND YOU GUYS CAN WORK ON SOME OF THAT UV PAINT IN THE BACK. YES, NO, ANYTHING? GENTLEMEN? I HAVE SO MANY IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO INCORPORATE THE UV, AND THE BOYS KEEP TELLING ME, "JUST WAIT. JUST WAIT. WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT. IT'LL COME TO US. JUST WAIT." WE'RE ALREADY RUNNING OUT OF TIME. IF I GO HOME BECAUSE THESE FRICKIN' BOYS ARE BASTARDS, I AM JUST GONNA HATE MYSELF. - PLEASE DON'T BE MAD AT US, NATALIE. ME AND DUTCH, WE'RE TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED, BUT NATALIE IS GETTING REAL FLUSTERED, AND IT'S FOOLISH. - 30 MINUTES! - I'M EXCITED TO USE THE ULTRAVIOLET, BECAUSE I'VE WORKED WITH ULTRAVIOLET PAINT BEFORE. SO I START TO PAINT THESE BIG FAST AND EASY FLAMES, GIVING KIND OF A 3-D CHROMADEPTH FEEL. - GEAR. - YES. - I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO BLACK LIGHT ON MINE. - ANYTHING YOU WANT TO REALLY, REALLY POP, PUT A WHITE UNDERLAY DOWN FIRST. SEE WHATEVER IS... - AWESOME. - TALKING TO YOU OVER THERE. - WE'RE SO FORTUNATE THAT GEAR HAS EXPERIENCE DOING UV PAINT. HE WHIPS OUT HIS SKILLS IN THE LAST TEN MINUTES OF THE CHALLENGE. I HOPE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH, BECAUSE WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. - I GOT THE FLASHLIGHT OVER MY AIRBRUSH. IT'S LIKE CLOSE-QUARTERS COMBAT. IT'S LIKE GUN OVER KNIFE. - 15 MINUTES LEFT! - GUYS, HOW IS IT LOOKING BACK THERE? DUTCH IS BEING SO SELFISH. HIS FREAKIN' ZEUS, THAT'S ALL HE'S SPENDING TIME ON. DRAWLING A FREAKIN' ILLUSTRATION BOOK ON THE BACK OF HIS GIRL AND I SAY, "BOYS, GET THE GIRLS OVER HERE. LET'S GET 'EM TOGETHER." ALL RIGHT, CAMILLA-- BRING HER OVER HERE. DID YOU DO ANY UV ON THE FRONT OF YOUR GIRL? - YEAH. OH, NO, I DIDN'T. - BETTER GET ON THAT, MAN. - OKAY. - [bleep] DAMN IT. - OKAY, I NEED SOMEONE TO SHINE A UV SPOTLIGHT. - HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE, HERE. - I NEED TO GET IN THE MIDDLE. - CAN YOU DO THAT NOW? HAVE YOU GOT TIME? - 60 SECONDS, FELLAS. SPEED IT UP! - TURN TO THE FRONT, PLEASE. - NO, NO, NO. TURN AROUND. YEAH, YEAH. RIGHT THERE. - BADASS JOB. KICK ASS, DUDE. WE DID SUCH A GOOD JOB. [timer beeps] - ALL RIGHT, GUYS, IT'S TIME! - THAT'S IT! TIME IS UP, PAINTERS. PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. [gasps] [cheers and applause] - AMAZING. I HOPE YOU'RE ALL PLEASED WITH YOUR CREATURES. THE JUDGES ARE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE MAGIC YOU'VE CREATED. - THE OTHER TEAM, LOOKING AT THEM FROM ACROSS THE ROOM, THEY'RE SHAKIN' IN THEIR BOOTS. - I'M NERVOUS. WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT OUR FULL CONCEPT LOOKS LIKE UNDER THOSE BLACK LIGHTS. - LET'S DO IT. all: ALL RIGHT. - FOLLOW ME. MODELS, TOO. - WELCOME, PAINTERS. FOR THIS TEAM CHALLENGE, YOU HAD FIVE HOURS TO CREATE A GROUP OF THREE MYTHICAL CREATURES THAT LOOKED ONE WAY IN THE DAYLIGHT AND REVEALED AN ENHANCED SIDE IN ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT. ONE MEMBER OF THE TOP TEAM WILL BE DECLARED THE WINNER. AND ONE MEMBER OF THE LOSING TEAM WILL BE GOING HOME. BEFORE WE START THE SHOW, THE JUDGES WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE STORY YOU CREATED FOR YOUR INSPIRATION. TEAM AWESOME. - OUR HERO IS FACED WITH ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT CREATURES SENT BY THESE MEAN GODS TO TRY AND HOLD HIM DOWN. - SOUNDS KIND OF FAMILIAR. ARE WE MEAN GODS? [laughter] - IT'S LACED WITH METAPHOR. - IT IS. - RIGHT. - TEAM BLONDETOURAGE. - SERENA THE SIREN SNAPS OFF THE HORN OF THE UNICORN GETTING ITS POWER. AND GANNON THE DRAGON SETS OUT ON A QUEST TO KILL SERENA AND GET BACK THE HORN. - WELL DONE. WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. - THANK YOU. - LET'S START THE SHOW. [electronic dance music] ♪ ♪ - I'M REALLY FEELING GREAT. WE GOT IT. OUR WORK IS POPPING. EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT, AND EVERYTHING HAS THE "WOW" FACTOR. [upbeat dance music] - I HAD TO BRING MY PIECE DOWN A FEW NOTCHES SO THAT I COULD HELP BRING MY TEAMMATES UP A FEW NOTCHES, BUT HONESTLY, I STILL FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE TOP SPOT ON THIS ONE. - EVEN THOUGH MY TEAM'S COMMUNICATION SUCKED, I'M SUPER HAPPY WITH MY PIECE. I LOVE THE WAY THE MINOTAUR TURNED OUT. - LIGHTS OUT, PLEASE. [upbeat electronic music] ♪ ♪ - I DON'T THINK WE INCORPORATED THE UV PAINT WELL. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE STARTED ON IT AS SOON AS THE JUDGES SAID SOMETHING. - I HAD THE ZEUS FIGURE WITH THE LIGHTNING BOLTS AND THAT'S A VERY STRIKING IMAGERY TO MAKE THOSE LIGHTNING BOLTS POP IN THE BLACK LIGHT. [electronic dance music] ♪ ♪ - LOOKING AT MY PIECE VERSUS MY TEAMMATES' PIECES IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS TO ME THAT MY PIECE IS THE WEAKEST PIECE, AND I JUST START PRACTICING MY CONCESSION SPEECH IN MY HEAD. - I FEEL PROUD OF IT.

I'M FEELING SUPERCONFIDENT. - UV'S SOMETHING I'VE DONE FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS.

NOTE TO SELF: GET NEW MIND. [laughter] - THE JUDGES WANT TO SPEAK TO BOTH TEAMS TONIGHT. - SO, BLONDETOURAGE, WHO DID WHAT IN TERMS OF THE WORK? - THE UNICORN IS MINE. GEAR DID A REALLY BEAUTIFUL DRAGON. - AND SIREN IS NICOLE. - YES. - NICOLE, SINCE SHE'S REALLY BADASS AT GLAMOUR MAKEUP, YOU KNOW, I FIGURE I'M GONNA DELEGATE THE FACE TO HER. - SO NICOLE DID THE FACES ON ALL OF THE MODELS? - YES. - YEAH. - WHEN GEAR'S PIECE WALKED OUT, I WAS INTRIGUED, AND I LOVED THE CHARACTER. - THANK YOU. - AND THAT SIREN THERE, SHE IS DARK NIGHT OF THE SPIRIT. - THANK YOU. - SIREN AND THE DRAGON ARE, LIKE, BADASS AND POWERFUL. AND I'M NOT SURE WHERE SHANNON'S PEGACORN FITS IN. IT FEELS CARTOONISH. - THAT UNICORN, THE WEAKEST THING YOU'VE PAINTED IN THIS COMPETITION. AND IT'S THE CENTERPIECE OF THIS WHOLE GROUP PAINTING. SO IT--IT HURTS THAT MUCH MORE. - MM. - MODELS, CAN I ASK YOU TO TURN AROUND, PLEASE? - I MEAN, I DO LOVE THE IDEA OF THIS COMING TOGETHER, BUT IT'S A BIT JUMBLED, AND IT DID CONFUSE MY EYE. - ALL RIGHT, SO IF YOUR TEAM WERE THE LOSING TEAM, WHICH ONE OF YOU WOULD GO HOME? - DEFINITELY, I THINK ME. OVERALL, I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S THE STRONGEST PIECE. - WHAT GEAR DID TODAY, REALLY, SADLY, OVERSHADOWS WHAT SHANNON DID. I HAVE TO SAY SHANNON. - ALL RIGHT, GEAR. YOU'RE UP. - [sighs] I MEAN, I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT GONNA PUT EITHER ONE OF MY FRIENDS ON THE GUILLOTINE. I'M GONNA CHOOSE MYSELF. - HE'S GOT A HEART OF GOLD, FOR SURE. - SERIOUSLY. - I REALLY ADMIRE THE CAMARADERIE. YOU DID GENUINELY WORK VERY WELL TOGETHER. - I REALLY COULDN'T HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT THEM, ESPECIALLY THE UV. GEAR DID A LOT OF THE UV. - THERE WAS THE FULL SPECTRUM OF UV COLORS. THAT'S REALLY HARD TO DO, SO CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT. - [imitates explosion] - THANK YOU, TEAM BLONDETOURAGE. TEAM AWESOME. - I'M INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHO DID WHAT. - I CREATED OUR MINOTAUR. THEN I ALSO DID THE BACK SIDE OF THE FATES. - MY FRONT PIECE WAS THE FATES AND THE BACK SIDE OF THE MEDUSA, WHERE WE HAVE ZEUS WITH OUR HERO FIGHTING THE HYDRA. - I DID THE FRONT OF THE MEDUSA AND THE BACK OF THE MINOTAUR. - FELLE'S RENDERING ON THE BACK WAS RENDERED GORGEOUSLY, DIRECTLY OFF OF MY SKETCH THAT I DID FOR HIM. - DID YOU INDEED COPY HIS WORK, FELLE? - COPY IS A BAD WORD, BUT DUPLICATE SOUNDS BETTER. - WHO CAME UP WITH THE THREE HEADS? - THAT WAS ME. - WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT, IT GAVE ME THAT, "WOW." BUT THIS IS A BODY-PAINTING COMPETITION. AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE THAT WAS TIME THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SPENT ON MORE DETAIL ON THE ACTUAL PAINT. NATALIE, I THINK YOU ACTUALLY DID THE MOST DRAMATIC JOB USING THE BLACK LIGHT. - I DISAGREE. I REALLY LIKED WHAT DUTCH DID IN THE BLACK LIGHT. - THANK YOU. - SO IF YOUR TEAM IS THE LOSING TEAM, WHO'D GO HOME TONIGHT? - I FEEL LIKE I DID A GOOD JOB, AND I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE DUTCH DID A GOOD JOB. SO HANDS DOWN, DEFINITELY NATALIE. - I DID ALL OF MY OWN SKETCHES. I DIDN'T COPY ANYBODY ELSE'S, SO I WOULD SAY FELLE. - ALL RIGHT, DUTCH. - FELLE'S TECHNIQUE WITH THE AIRBRUSH IS VERY, VERY STRONG, AND NATALIE'S TECHNIQUE WITH THE BRUSH LOOKS VERY RUSHED. SO I WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE NATALIE. - TEAM TECHNICAL WOULD SAY THAT, YOU KNOW? - JUST BEING BRUTALLY HONEST. - BUT I WORKED MY ASS OFF ON THIS. - I'M NATALIE'S ROOMMATE, AND SHE STAYED UP ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT COMING UP WITH THE CONCEPT. THIS IS HER PIECE. THERE'S NO WAY SHE SHOULD GO HOME ON THIS CHALLENGE. - [chuckles] - THE BOYS FREAKIN' THREW ME UNDER THE FREAKIN' BUS, THE HUGE 18-WHEELER BUS. WITHOUT ME AND DUTCH, THIS WHOLE THING WOULDN'T EVEN FREAKIN' EXIST. - OH, NO. SHUT THE HELL UP, 'CAUSE I'M NOT GOIN' HOME. - THIS IS GONNA BE A REALLY TOUGH DECISION. - SO, GUYS, WHAT'D YOU THINK ABOUT TEAM BLONDETOURAGE? - YOU KNOW, I LOVED THE DIVERSITY OF THEIR PIECE, BUT THERE WAS A COHESIVE BLEND TO IT. - THE UV WAS POWERFUL. AND I LOVED THE SPECTRUM OF COLOR. - FOR ME, YOU KNOW, THE BACK, I LIKED THE IDEA OF ALL THOSE THINGS COMING TOGETHER, BUT I COULDN'T QUITE MAKE SENSE OF IT. - MM-HMM. - BUT GEAR OUTDID HIMSELF. HE REALLY MOVED AWAY FROM THAT STEREOTYPICAL GEAR LOOK - IT FELT LIKE A MATURE PAINTING. - AND HE HAD THE UV ACCENTS THAT REALLY PULLED THE PIECE TOGETHER. - LET'S ALSO GIVE NICOLE CREDIT FOR THE FACES THAT SHE DID. - OH, YEAH. YEAH, SHE WAS THE LEADER. THERE WAS A DYNAMIC QUALITY TO ALL OF THE MODELS, AND NICOLE IS THE ONE THAT HELPED BRING THAT PACKAGE TOGETHER. - THAT POSE THEY DID--DRAMATIC. - I LOVED IT. OH, MY GOD. - AND THAT'S NICOLE, AGAIN. - YEAH. SHANNON, FOR ME, WAS THE WEAK LINK. - HERS FELT VERY AMATEURISH AND STREET FAIR. - ABSOLUTELY. - AND WHAT ABOUT TEAM AWESOME? - NOT SO AWESOME. - NOT SO MUCH. IT WAS TOO SIMPLE, BUT I THINK THEY GOT CAUGHT UP ON THE ACCESSORIES. AND THEY REALLY FELT HURT BY THE UV CHALLENGE. - MM-HMM. DUTCH'S PIECE WITH THE THREE HEADS, YOU KNOW, GIMMICKY. - I'M LIKE, "REALLY?" YOU SPENT ALL YOUR TIME ON THESE DETAILED, CRAZY HEADS. AND THEN YOU'RE JUST GONNA THROW AWAY THE WHOLE FRONT OF YOUR CENTERPIECE. - FELLE FELT LIKE THE WEAKEST LINK. - REALLY? - HE CONTINUES TO STAY IN THE MONOCHROMATIC REALM. AND HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CREATIVITY OF THIS DESIGN. - I FEEL LIKE NATALIE WAS THE WEAKEST LINK. TO ME, IT LOOKED LIKE A HALLOWEEN COSTUME THAT SOMEBODY'S MOM MADE. - I HAVE TO SAY THAT NATALIE WAS DEFINITELY MORE CREATIVE THAN FELLE. - SHE IS A CREATIVE FORCE. - TEAM AWESOME, I STILL LOVE YA, EVEN THOUGH WE TURNED INTO TEAM THROW UNDER BUS. - WELL, I DON'T FEEL ANY REGRET FOR DOING THAT. - BUT IF I GO HOME TONIGHT... - I DID-- I DID WHAT THEY ASKED ME TO DO. - IT SUCKS TO GO HOME IN A GROUP CHALLENGE. - SO YOU'VE MADE YOUR DECISION? - I GUESS SO. [suspenseful music] - WELCOME BACK, PAINTERS. - HI. - HEY. - TONIGHT, THE JUDGES WERE DIVIDED. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, SOMEONE HAS TO GO HOME. TEAM BLONDETOURAGE, PLEASE STEP FORWARD.

GEAR, THE JUDGES WANT TO THANK YOU FOR STEPPING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND FINALLY USING A NEW COLOR PALETTE. - YES! - THEY FELT LIKE THEY SAW REAL GROWTH FROM YOU TONIGHT. - THANK YOU. - SHANNON, WHILE THE JUDGES APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU DID ON THE BACK OF YOUR PIECE, THEY FELT LIKE YOUR UNICORN WAS A LITTLE TOO CARTOONISH. - HMM. - YOU DODGED A BULLET TONIGHT. - UNBELIEVABLE. - BUT THANKS TO YOUR TEAMMATES' STRONG WORK, YOU ARE SAFE. - IT'S OKAY.
