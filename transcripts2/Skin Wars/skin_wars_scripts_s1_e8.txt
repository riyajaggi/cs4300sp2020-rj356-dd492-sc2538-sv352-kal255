GOOD MORNING, PAINTERS. - HI. - HI. - I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE DOWN TO THE FINAL THREE. - I'M SO HAPPY THAT I'M IN THE FINAL THREE.

 I HAVE LEARNED A TON. I HAVE STEPPED OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE, AND I HAVE DONE THINGS THAT I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. - THIS IS NOT A REALLY GOOD PAINTING. THIS IS A GREAT PAINTING. - AND I'VE BEEN IN THE BOTTOM THREE THREE TIMES. I'VE COME CLOSE TO HAVING TO GO HOME BY THE RISKS THAT I'VE TAKEN. - I HAVE TO ADMIT, I DID NOT GET THIS AT ALL. - BUT I'M GONNA TAKE AWAY A SENSE OF PRIDE... - LOVE THAT REVEAL. - AND A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE. - I THINK THAT YOUR CREATIVITY IS OUTSTANDING. - YOUR STORYTELLING IS QUITE UNIQUE. - IF I WON THIS, IT WOULD PUT NATALIE FLETCHER ON THE MAP. - DID ANY OF YOU THINK ON DAY ONE THAT IT WOULD BE THE THREE OF YOU STANDING HERE? - YES. - OH! - HEY, HEY, HEY. I CAME HERE TO WIN SKIN WARS. I DIDN'T COME HERE TO LOSE. THIS PIECE I'M DOING ON YOUR BACK RIGHT NOW IS REALLY FRICKING GORGEOUS. I'VE DEFINITELY GROWN AS AN ARTIST. - DUTCH, YOU'RE A TECHNIQUE MONSTER. - I LOVED DUTCH. I THOUGHT THAT WAS SO BRILLIANT. - DUTCH, I THINK YOU DID AN INCREDIBLE JOB HERE. THE MODEL LAYING OVER BACKWARDS, IT'S STRIKING. - I DIDN'T GET ANGRY WHEN THE JUDGES DIDN'T SEE THINGS MY WAY. - YOU ALSO HAD ONE OF THE MOST "BORING" POSES. - ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER A BRIDE. I HAVE TAKEN MY LUMPS, BUT MY HEAD'S IN A GOOD PLACE. - THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS DUTCH. - I NEED TO WIN SKIN WARS, BECAUSE I WANNA PUT MY DAUGHTERS THROUGH COLLEGE. LET'S DO THIS. - AND, SHANNON. - HEY, YOU GUYS. - WOW! - I'M SHANNON. I'M IN THE TOP THREE. SUPER, SUPER HAPPY TO BE HERE. THAT'S BANANAS! I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH. HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO COVER A SUMO IN ONE HOUR? THESE CHALLENGES HAVE REALLY OPENED UP THE DOOR TO BRING MY FINE ART INTO MY BODY PAINTINGS. - THE FINE ART ELEMENT TO THIS MASTERPIECE IS SO REFRESHING. - THANK YOU. IT'S EMOTIONAL FOR ME. OH, I'M BARELY HANGING BY A THREAD. AND IT'S BEEN A REAL BLESSING IN MY ARTISTIC PATH. - TO SHOW HERSELF DECOMPOSING IS PRETTY BRAVE. - IT'S PRETTY BRAVE. - I HAVE THIS GREAT BOOST OF CONFIDENCE... LOVE IT. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT. AND I DO THINK I CAN WIN. - YOU SHOULD ALL BE REALLY PROUD OF YOURSELVES FOR MAKING IT TO THE FINALS. WELL DONE. JUDGES, ANY FINAL WORDS OF ADVICE? - IT'S OBVIOUS YOU HAVE THE SKILLS, TECHNIQUES. JUST FOLLOW YOUR HEART. - THIS IS SUCH AN EXCITING FINAL THREE, BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL SUCH DIFFERENT ARTISTS. SO I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT WE HAVE IN STORE. - ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE FIRST-EVER SKIN WARS CHAMPION. AS A SURPRISE, WE ARE THRILLED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE WINNER WILL ALSO RECEIVE YOUR VERY OWN NATIONALLY DISTRIBUTED CUSTOM LINE OF PAINT BY EUROPEAN BODY ART. YOUR NAME WILL APPEAR ON YOUR VERY OWN LINE OF PAINTS. - WHOA. - OH, MY GOD. THAT'S INSANE. - YEAH! - OH, MY GOD. THAT'S DEFINITELY, LIKE, CHILLS DOING THIS RIGHT NOW. - FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU WILL CHOOSE A BOLD BACKDROP, AND YOU MUST CREATE A PAINTING THAT WILL LITERALLY POP OUT OF THE BACKGROUND TO CREATE A PIECE OF 3-D ART. YOU WILL HAVE TWO HOURS TO PAINT A HEAD-TO-TOE, STANDOUT LOOK. ALL RIGHT, PAINTERS, PLEASE PICK OUT YOUR BACKGROUND. YOUR TIME STARTS NOW! - THE CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO DO A POP ART THAT MAKES IT APPEAR THAT THIS PERSON IN THE PHOTOGRAPH IS COMING OUT THREE-DIMENSIONALLY FROM A STATIC BACKGROUND. - OH, THIS IS HARD. - I'VE GOT MINE. - THIS IS AMBITIOUS, BUT I'M GONNA TRY IT. - I FOUND AN IMAGE THAT SPEAKS TO ME, BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW TO MAKE A MODEL POP OUT OF IT. THE ONLY IMAGE THAT I CONNECT WITH IS THIS KIND OF GRAFFITI, FLATLY LIGHTED PIECE OF ARTWORK. - AAH. - AAH! HA HA! - HEY. I'M GONNA HAVE YOU POSING KIND OF LIKE THIS. I REALIZE IS THAT THE ONLY THING I CAN DO WITH THIS BACKGROUND IS TO PAINT AN ARTIST CREATING IT. - THE BACKGROUND IS A REALLY LUSH, VIBRANT SWAMP SCENE, SO THE CONCEPT'S BASED ON THE OLD CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. BEING THAT I HAVE A CUTE LITTLE MODEL, I'VE GOTTA DO THE BEST I CAN TO MAKE HER LOOK OMINOUS AND DARK. - THAT'S, LIKE, THE COOLEST THING I'VE EVER HEARD. - YEAH. I HAVE DECIDED THAT I'M GOING TO OBSCURE HER AND ACTUALLY DO A LITTLE CAMOUFLAGE FROM MID-THIGH DOWN, WHICH WILL SAVE ME FROM HAVING TO GO IN AND RENDER A LOT OF DETAIL. - TODAY, I'M GONNA TRY SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE-- MAKING THE MODEL LOOK LIKE SHE'S UNDERWATER. SO I'M TRYING TO USE WHAT I REMEMBER FROM ME JUMPING IN A POOL WITH A WHITE SHIRT AND WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE. GIVE YOU A WHITE SHIRT, - BUT IT'S GONNA BE STUCK TO YOU 'CAUSE YOU'RE WET, SO IT'S GONNA BE-- - SO, LIKE, WHITE-- WHITE T-SHIRT CONTEST KIND OF. - DO NOT CHEAPEN THIS FOR ME, LIZZIE. I'M JUST GONNA GO FOR IT. - I WANT IT TO BE REALLY RIGHT. I START PAINTING A VERY REALISTIC SIDE TO A RED JEAN. IT'S NOT RIGHT. UGH, I JUST-- OOH, I JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO DO THIS CHALLENGE. 45 MINUTES INTO THE COMPETITION, NATALIE HAS HER MODEL COVERED FROM HEAD TO TOE, AND SO DOES DUTCH. - OH, THAT LOOKS AWESOME. - AND I'VE ONLY GOT THIS MUCH COVERED, LITERALLY. I'M BEHIND. I NEED TO DO SOMETHING REALLY BOLD AND GET THIS MODEL COVERED IN A REALLY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. I'D, LIKE, LOVE TO GO FOR REALISM, BUT AT THIS POINT, I HAVE A [bleep] HOUR. AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS CHALLENGE NOW. I TAKE OUT A FAT BRUSH, AND I DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT I JUST PAINTED. THIS IS TOO HARD. SO ALL THE REALISM THAT I JUST MADE IS NOW DESTROYED. I'M GONNA DO A PAINTED PAINTER PAINTING A PAINTING. STUPID MISTAKE. - ONE HOUR LEFT! - I WANNA MAKE THIS MONSTER LOOK LIKE IT SHOULD BE IN THE SEA, AND SO I DECIDE TO BORROW FROM NICOLE'S BAG OF TRICKS AND DO SOME WEBBING BETWEEN THE FINGERS. - WATCH MY FINGER. - I DON'T THINK YOU GOT MUCH TO WORRY ABOUT. - I NEED ALL OF THEM. - ARE YOU SURE? - MM-HMM. - THEY'RE GET LIGHTER, BUT... I WANT TO PAINT ON HER HANDS THOSE WHITE CIRCLE HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU PUT YOUR HANDS UP AGAINST THE SHOWER DOOR. I'M GIVING HER, LIKE, JUST A BARELY BLUE TINT, BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ANYTHING UNDERWATER, IT ALL HAS THAT, LIKE, HAZY BLUE LOOK TO IT. - I'VE GOT DIFFERENT LIGHT SOURCES, AND I'VE GOT TO ADJUST FOR WHERE THAT LIGHT WOULD FALL ON HER BODY IF SHE WERE A PART OF THAT BACKDROP. - I LIKE THE IDEA OF YOU PAINTING IN YOUR BRA, 'CAUSE I DO THAT A LOT IN MY OWN STUDIO. - ONE MORE MINUTE, GUYS! - YELLOW. YELLOW. INTO POSITION, PLEASE. - OTHER SIDE ON THE HANDS. - ARMS UP. - TIME'S UP, PAINTERS! PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN! - WHAT? NO! I NEED WAY MORE TIME. - WOW. - WOW. - TELL ME ABOUT THIS. - WE'VE GOT A DOUBLE LIGHT SOURCE HERE. - SO YOU HAVE THE LIGHT COMING FROM BEHIND THROUGH THE TREES AND ALSO REFLECTING FROM THE BOTTOM OFF THE WATER. - SO SHE'S NOT COMPLETELY BLACKED OUT IN THE FRONT, BUT SHE'S DEFINITELY DARKER, 'CAUSE THE LIGHT'S AT HER BACK. AND THEN I'VE GOT THESE HIGHLIGHTS THAT ARE SHOWING AROUND THE EDGES. - HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER PAINTERS, WHAT THEY'RE DOING? - I LOOKED AROUND. I SAW WHAT THEY WERE UP TO. AND--AND--AND, YOU KNOW, GREAT FOR THEM. IT--IT LOOKS FANTASTIC, GUYS. - I THINK WHAT DUTCH IS TRYING TO SAY IS THAT, "I DID NOT COME HERE TO MAKE FRIENDS." - YEAH. - HI, SHANNON. HOW'S IT GOING? - HEY. JUST GOT FINISHED. - THAT IMPLIES THAT YOU FELT YOU WERE SHORT ON TIME. - MY ORIGINAL CONCEPT WAS A MORE REALISTIC ARTIST, BUT I HAD TO CHANGE CONCEPT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. - SO THE EXPRESSIONISTIC THING SORT OF CAME IN. - YES. HER PAINTED STYLE COMPLEMENTS THIS PAINTED STYLE. SO SHE CAME OUT OF THIS. - WELL, THANK YOU, SHANNON. HI, NATALIE. - I SAW THIS UNDERWATER BACKGROUND, AND I WAS LIKE, "THAT WOULD BE CRAZY IF SOMEBODY TRIED TO, LIKE, PAINT SOMEONE LOOKING LIKE THEY WERE UNDERWATER. AND, LIKE, WHAT WHITE LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT'S UNDERWATER, IT'S LIKE YOUR FLESH TONE. AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING THROUGH WATER, EVERYTHING KIND OF HAS THAT SLIGHT WATERCOLORED TINT TO IT. - NOW, HAVE YOU EVER DONE A 3-D PAINTING BEFORE? - NO, I'VE WORKED WITH BACKGROUNDS BUT JUST CAMOUFLAGING BACKGROUNDS. - OKAY, THANK YOU, NATALIE. - THANKS, GUYS. - SO, GUYS, WHAT DO YOU THINK? - SHANNON CHANGED HER CONCEPT AND, I THINK, FOR THE BETTER. - I THINK, AT THIS LEVEL IN THE COMPETITION, TO NOT HAVE YOUR WORK PLANNED OUT START TO FINISH, THAT IS RISKY. - IT IS RISKY, BUT THAT'S HOW SHE FLIES. SHE GOES BY WHAT'S IN HER HEART. - WHEN I WALKED IN, MY EYES WENT STRAIGHT TO DUTCH'S... - HEY, YOU AND ME BOTH. - LITTLE SWAMP THING. THE DRAMA, THE HIGH CONTRAST, THE STRONG CHARACTER, IT WAS A SMART MOVE. - WHAT ABOUT NATALIE? - SHE REALLY CHALLENGED HERSELF TO DO SOMETHING VERY UNUSUAL, WHICH IS PAINT TRANSPARENT WET CLOTHING. - YES. - IT WAS A GREAT IDEA, BUT, YOU KNOW, WAS IT A LITTLE BIT TOO SUBTLE? - TO DO SOMETHING SO RISKY, THAT GIRL IS A DANGEROUS GIRL, AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT HER. - I FEEL LIKE SHE HAS GROWN LIKE CRAZY... - YES. - DURING THIS COMPETITION. - SO HAVE YOU MADE YOUR DECISION? both: YES. - MM-HMM. - YEAH. - FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU EACH HAD TO CREATE A PAINTING THAT REALLY POPPED OFF THE CANVAS. NOW IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT WHICH PAINTER'S CREATION CAUGHT THE JUDGES' ATTENTION MOST. THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... DUTCH. CONGRATULATIONS! - I KNEW THAT I WAS GONNA WIN THIS CHALLENGE. - THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME FOR DUTCH TO GAIN MOMENTUM BECAUSE THE ONE THING THAT SHANNON AND I HAVE ON TOP OF DUTCH IS OUR CREATIVITY. AND IF DUTCH GAINS THAT ON TOP OF HIS TECHNIQUE, WE'RE SCREWED. - THE HIGH CONTRAST FIT THIS CHALLENGE, AND YOU DID POP YOUR MODEL RIGHT OUT OF THAT WORLD. - AS THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE, YOU HAVE WON A YEAR OF BODY PAINTING SUPPLIES COURTESY OF FRENDS BEAUTY SUPPLY. - IT'S A GREAT PRIZE I CAN USE IN MY BUSINESS. - NICE. - THAT'S AWESOME. - THAT IS AWESOME. - NICE JOB. - BY THIS TIME TOMORROW, ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE FIRST-EVER SKIN WARS CHAMPION. - I JUST GOT LIGHT-HEADED. - I DID TOO. - [laughs] - FOR THE FINAL CHALLENGE, YOUR CANVAS IS BLANK. YOU HAVE TO CREATE TWO LOOKS. THESE FINAL LOOKS SHOULD BE THE CULMINATION OF EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE TO THIS POINT. SO IF YOU WANT TO COME OUT ON TOP, YOU NEED TO REALLY KNOCK THEIR SOCKS OFF. YOU WILL HAVE SIX HOURS TO COMPLETE YOUR TWO PAINTINGS, AND YOU WILL HAVE TWO MODELS. - THIS IS THE LAST CHALLENGE. THIS IS THE FINALE. NOTHING CAN BRING ME DOWN RIGHT NOW. - AND IN CASE THE $100,000 GRAND PRIZE ISN'T ENOUGH MOTIVATION TO BRING YOUR "A" GAME TOMORROW, WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA INSPIRATION. - YOU'VE ALL IMPRESSED THE JUDGES ALONG THE WAY, AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL HERE. WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE EXTRA INSPIRATION. NATALIE, SOMEONE'S HERE FOR YOU. - [crying] - MY BOYFRIEND, TODD, WALKS OUT, AND I JUST FREAK OUT. [crying] AS USUAL, I START CRYING, BUT THIS IS THE HAPPIEST I'VE FELT THIS WHOLE TIME. - SHANNON, THERE'S SOMEONE FOR YOU TOO. - [crying] OH! I GET TO SEE MY MOM AGAIN, AND MY HEART MELTS. EVERYTHING I'M WORRIED ABOUT HAS JUST DISAPPEARED. [crying] MAMA! MAMA! - AND, DUTCH... - WE DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU, DON'T WORRY. - NOPE, WE DIDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU. - IT IS REALLY GREAT TO SEE MY WIFE. MY WIFE IS THE OTHER HALF OF ME. WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER SINCE I WAS 19. - DUTCH, THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE. - OH! - YOUR KIDDOS. - GETTING TO SEE MY GIRLS IS A HUGE TREAT. OH! OH. THE SUN JUST BURSTS THROUGH ON A CLOUDY DAY WHEN I SEE MY CHILDREN. [growls] - [laughs] SO I DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW, GOT TEARY-EYED. - GIRLS, WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR DAD BEING IN THIS COMPETITION? - I THOUGHT, HE'S GONNA BE GONE FOR A LONG TIME. I GUESS I BETTER START GETTING USED TO MOM. [laughter] - ARREAH! - TODD, WERE YOU SURPRISED WHEN YOU HEARD NATALIE WAS IN THE FINALS? - I WASN'T. SHE DOES SUCH AMAZING WORK AND LIVES, BREATHES, SLEEPS BODY PAINTING. - CHARLOTTE, DO YOU HAVE ANY WORDS OF ENCOURAGEMENT FOR SHANNON? - WELL, I JUST WISH HER EVERY GOOD BRUSHSTROKE THAT YOU CAN DO. - THANKS, MAMA. - YEAH. I LOVE YOU. - I LOVE YOU. - YOU COULD TELL THAT THESE PAINTERS HAVE LOVE IN THEIR WORK, AND NOW WE SEE THE SOURCE. - GOOD NIGHT, EVERYONE. WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW AT THE FINALE. all: GOOD NIGHT. - BYE. GOOD NIGHT. THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - OH, SHE'S-- [laughter] - WHILE I WAS SHOWING MY DAUGHTERS AROUND THE WORK SPACE, THEY REALLY GRAVITATED TOWARD THE BRIGHTER, BUBBLE GUM PINK WIGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND I THOUGHT, WELL, GOSH, YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF A CRAZY COLOR, AND SO I THOUGHT MAYBE I'LL DO MY CONCEPT IN PINKS. - I'M ALMOST PISSED, 'CAUSE I'M LIKE, NOW I CAN'T FRICKING FOCUS, YOU KNOW? - THANKS. - I CAN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGE, BUT I'M JUST GONNA LET MY BRAIN TAKE A BREAK AND JUST ENJOY THIS MOMENT WITH MY LOVED ONE. I MISSED YOU. - CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD. AND IT'S BEEN REALLY, REALLY EMOTIONAL. - $100,000 ON THE LINE TOMORROW. AND, YOU KNOW, I GOTTA COME UP WITH MY CONCEPT, BUT I WANNA HANG OUT WITH YOU. - ON THIS CHALLENGE, IF I REALLY PAINT ME IN THIS CHALLENGE, I THINK I STAND A GOOD SHOT. I'M STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW. I'M HAVING AN INTERNAL TUG-OF-WAR TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, IF I REALLY JUST DO ME, ARE THE JUDGES GONNA LIKE IT? - I REALLY, REALLY WANNA WIN. YOU KNOW? I JUST HAVE TO DO IT. - IT HAS BEEN A CRAZY TRIP. LONGEST MONTH OF OUR LIVES. - YEAH. - SO WE, LIKE, HEAR ABOUT YOU GUYS 'CAUSE ALL WE CAN DO IS TALK ABOUT, LIKE, OUR LOVED ONES. - YEAH. - AND HE TALKS ABOUT YOU GUYS NONSTOP. - SORRY. SORRY. - I FEEL LIKE I KNOW YOU ALL SO WELL, AND I DON'T KNOW YOU. - WE'RE PRETTY LAID-BACK. - I'M SO HAPPY THAT YOU'RE HERE. I LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER SO MUCH. - OH. ME TOO. - ALL RIGHT, SORRY. - SO I HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO TODD NOW. BUT HE JUST SAYS, YOU KNOW, "DO YOUR BEST. YOU'VE GOT THIS." - IT IS HARD TO SAY GOOD-BYE, BUT I TELL MY MOM THAT I'M GONNA WIN IT FOR HER. - I THINK HAVING YOU GUYS HERE IS REALLY GONNA HELP ME TOMORROW. CAREFUL. - DO GOOD TOMORROW, OKAY? - BYE, DADDY. - I WILL. I WILL. BYE-BYE. - FOR ME. - IT WAS REALLY GREAT TO SEE MY WIFE AND MY KIDS. WITH FAMILY COMES SUPPORT. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS, IT'S DISTRACTING ME FROM MY TASK. AND I JUST DON'T HAVE A CLEAR IDEA OF HOW TODAY IS GONNA TURN OUT. - HEY, GOOD MORNING, LADIES. - WELL, TODAY'S CONCEPT IS BASICALLY FREESTYLE. - OH. - THE CHALLENGE FOR TODAY IS TO PAINT TWO MODELS, AND THEY ARE A BLANK CANVAS. WE CAN DO ANYTHING WE WANT ON THEM. WE SHOULD PAY HOMAGE TO THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGHOUT OUR JOURNEY AT SKIN WARS. - I'M GOING REAL NATALIE WITH IT. - WHAT'S--WHAT'S THE-- - THE THEME IS KIND OF OPEN. TODAY, MY PIECES ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETELY ME. SO YOU'LL BE TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE PIECES THAT WILL FORM SOMETHING AT THE END. AND YOU'RE GONNA GO TOGETHER. LIKE, THE COLOR SCHEME-- INSTEAD OF ME GOING, LIKE, OPPOSITE COLORS, I'M GONNA MAKE YOU GUYS VERY MUCH MATCH. - COLOR COORDINATED. - COLOR COORDINATED. - PUT YOUR ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER'S NECKS, PLEASE. THERE WE GO. THAT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY. MY CONCEPT IS TO PAINT THE TWO SIDES OF ME-- THE BENEVOLENT SIDE AND THE SNARKIER SIDE. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. I WANT TO PAINT A BIG, PINK BRAIN TO SHOW, LIKE, FREEDOM OF MIND AND CREATIVITY. MY BRAIN ON ART. SO CAN YOU REMEMBER THIS POSITION? - GUYS, LAST CHALLENGE. - I KNOW. - LET ME GET A BASE GOING HERE. - DUTCH, ARE YOU DOING A BACKGROUND? - YEAH. I INITIALLY HAD, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING VERY, VERY DUTCH IN MIND, SOMETHING RATHER HORRIFYING. AND THEN WHEN I SEE MY FAMILY, MY PALETTE IN MY BRAIN CHANGES. AND THEREFORE, MY ENTIRE CREATIVE PROCESS CHANGES. - HALFWAY THROUGH THIS CHALLENGE, I AM NOT EVEN FINISHED COVERING MY GIRLS. I STILL SEE SKIN, AND THAT IS TERRIFYING. - GOOD MORNING, PAINTERS! - GOOD MORNING. - MORNING. - SHANNON, CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT? - SURE. MY CONCEPT IS THE VOICE OF THE PAINTER AND THE TWO SEPARATE SIDES OF ME-- THE BENEVOLENT SIDE, YOU KNOW, THE ANIMAL RESCUER. THE OTHER SIDE IS, LIKE, THE COMPETITOR WHO HAS TOLERANCE ISSUES. - YOU'VE CONTINUED THAT TECHNIQUE YOU STARTED A FEW CHALLENGES AGO. - THIS IS A NEW THING THAT I WANT TO JUST EXPLORE MORE AND PLAY WITH MORE. - IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL. - I'M TAKING IT WITH ME. - THANK YOU, SHANNON. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - HI, NATALIE. - I'M HAVING AN ACID FLASHBACK. - RIGHT NOW, IT DOES JUST LOOK LIKE AN ACID TRIP, BUT THERE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT PARTS OF ART. AND CREATIVITY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS YOUR TECHNIQUE. AND SO I'M GONNA PAINT A LOT OF THINGS THAT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE. AS YOU CAN SEE, PAISLEY HAS ALWAYS BEEN, LIKE, A VERY IMPORTANT PATTERN TO ME. THE BUTTERFLY HAS ALWAYS KIND OF, LIKE, SYMBOLIZED TRANSFORMATION AND GROWTH, AND I FEEL LIKE THIS COMPETITION, I'VE DONE MORE OF THAT THAN I EVER HAVE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. AND I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE PROUD OF MY HANDS BEFORE. AND I KNOW THAT HANDS ARE DEFINITELY ONE OF THE HARDER THINGS TO PAINT, ESPECIALLY REALISTICALLY... - BRAVE. - BUT I HAD TO REPRESENT MY HANDS UP IN HERE TODAY. - HI, DUTCH. - HI. - TELL US ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT. - I WANT TO MIX 3-D ILLUSION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF HORROR. SO I'VE BEEN CHAMPING AT THE BIT TO DO SOMETHING KIND OF ALIEN-LIKE, WHICH IS PIECES OF ME, SO IT'S GONNA BE A FRANKENSTEIN-ESQUE TYPE PIECE. - OKAY. - AND THEN ON THE BACK, I'M PLANNING TO TIE IN ALL OF MY EXPERIENCES IN A MURAL FORM. - THAT IS A KALEIDOSCOPE OF BRIGHT COLORS. HOW IS THAT WORKING OUT? - I'M TRYING TO MAKE MY MONSTERS ELEGANT. THERE'S GONNA BE A TOUCH OF ELEGANCE TO BOTH OF THEM. - HOW WAS IT SEEING YOUR FAMILY? HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOU LAST NIGHT? - OH, GOSH. THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. WE LAUGHED. WE CRIED. WE HAD A GOOD TIME. - OKAY. THANK YOU, DUTCH. - THANK YOU, GUYS. HEY, GUYS, 30 MINUTES LEFT. I FEEL LIKE I'M TRUDGING THROUGH TAR. I'M OUT OF SORTS TODAY. I'M NOT GONNA DENY THAT I SHOWED UP THIS MORNING WITH A LACK OF FOCUS. [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ OH, BOY. [sighs] [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - I LOVE THIS PIECE. IT'S GREAT. - BEST-CASE SCENARIO TODAY, NATALIE WALKS OUT OF HERE WITH $100,000. FIVE MINUTES LEFT, EVERYBODY. - FIVE MINUTES, HUH? - WHAT THE [bleep]? 45 SECONDS LEFT, AND MY AIRBRUSH CLOGS UP AND THEN THE THING SPUTTERS, AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FINISH THE THING UP. DAMN. - THE FINAL SECONDS ARE COUNTING DOWN, AND I REALIZE, THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUSH MYSELF MENTALLY IN THIS WAY. - LET ME SEE THAT WRIST REAL QUICK. [timer beeps] - OKAY, PAINTERS! TIME IS UP! PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. - GOOD JOB. - THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'M GONNA SAY THAT. - MY GIRLS LOOK EXACTLY THE WAY I WANTED THEM TO LOOK. THEY LOOK BEAUTIFUL, AND THEY LOOK JUST LIKE ME. - WOW, YOU GUYS. ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOUR WORK? - YEAH, SUPER HAPPY. - YEAH? DUTCH? - I THINK WHAT IT WOULD MEAN MOST FOR ME TO WIN, MY ARTWORK IS COMING OUT, AND I CAN BE PROUD ABOUT THAT. - IT'S BEEN SUCH A CRAZY JOURNEY, AND NOW IT COMES DOWN TO THIS MOMENT. - PAINTERS AND MODELS, FOLLOW ME. - FOR THE FIRST TIME, I SEE THE FINISH LINE. ONE OF US IS GOING HOME $100,000 RICHER. - WELCOME, PAINTERS. THIS IS IT, THE FINAL SHOWDOWN. ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK HAS LED TO THIS MOMENT. TONIGHT, ONE OF YOU WILL BE CROWNED AS FIRST-EVER SKIN WARS CHAMPION. - GOD, NATALIE LOOKS SO BEAUTIFUL. - FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WERE GIVEN SIX HOURS TO CREATE TWO LOOKS THAT SHOW WHAT SETS YOU APART AS AN ARTIST. THE JUDGES WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOU COULD BRING WHEN YOU WERE GIVEN A BLANK SLATE. AND THEY ARE READY TO BE WOWED. YOU ALL KNOW OUR ESTEEMED JUDGES-- CRAIG TRACY... - HELLO, PAINTERS. - ROBIN SLONINA... - HELLO. - AND RUPAUL CHARLES. - LOOK AT YOU GORGEOUS PEOPLE. OKAY. LET THE FINAL SHOW BEGIN. [electronic music] ♪ ♪ - THEY'RE JUST STUNNING! BRIGHT COLORS AND THICK LINES THAT I CAN SEE FROM WHERE I'M STANDING. AND I KNOW THAT THE JUDGES CAN JUST REALLY FEEL THAT BOLDNESS. - OH, MY GOD. - LOOK AT THAT. - AND THEN THEY RAISED THEIR HANDS, AND THEY CONNECT THEIR BIG, GLITTERY HEART THAT I HAD DONE. I'M JUST SO FRICKING PROUD OF THEM. AND THEN THEY KISS. THEY WAITED TILL THE END TO DO IT, WHICH IS BRILLIANT. - WOW. - MY MODELS ARE ROCKING IT. THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB. I DO HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF PRIDE IN THIS PIECE. I FEEL LIKE I STAYED TRUE TO MY TECHNIQUES, WHICH IS WHAT I'M KNOWN FOR. BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I BROUGHT IN MORE EMOTIONAL ELEMENTS. THERE IS A STORY BEHIND WHAT I PAINTED. - THAT'S AWESOME. - I FEEL LIKE IF I GET ANY MORE PROUD, MY CHEST IS GONNA EXPLODE. I'M JUST BEAMING WITH IT RIGHT NOW. - WHEN I SEE MY PIECES... - THAT'S MY GIRL. - I LOVE THAT THEY EACH HAVE A DISTINCT LOOK. I AM PROUD OF MY WORK. I REACHED REALLY FAR INSIDE MYSELF. I WAS VERY REVEALING. I DISARMED MYSELF AND WAS JUST AS OPEN AS I COULD POSSIBLY BE ABOUT WHO I AM AS A PAINTER. - THAT IS SO SHANNON. - WOW. - I REALLY LOVE MY PIECE. I THINK THAT I HAVE THE WINNING COMBINATION. SO I'M JUST EXCITED TO HEAR WHAT THE JUDGES HAVE TO SAY. [cheers and applause] - SO, NATALIE, TELL US ABOUT YOUR CONCEPTS. - YESTERDAY WHEN I GOT TO SEE TODD, HE JUST SAID, "NATALIE, YOU BLEED PAINT." HE'S LIKE, "JUST DO YOU." AND SO THAT'S WHAT I DECIDED TO DO. I DECIDED TO THINK OF EVERYTHING THAT DRIVES ME AND WHY I DO WHAT I DO. AND NO MATTER HOW TONIGHT GOES, I'M JUST ON TOP OF THE WORLD. - NATALIE, EARLIER THIS MORNING, YOU SAID THAT ONE MODEL WOULD REPRESENT YOUR REALISTIC SIDE, AND ONE WOULD REPRESENT YOUR CREATIVE SIDE. - THAT'S WHY I ENDED UP BRINGING THIS OVER HERE BECAUSE I WAS LIKE, "YOU CAN'T DO ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER." A TECHNICAL PIECE IS SUPER BORING UNLESS IT'S CREATIVE. A CREATIVE PIECE DOESN'T COME ACROSS UNLESS IT'S KIND OF TECHNICAL. AND THAT'S WHAT THE WHOLE, LIKE, LOVE THING IS, BECAUSE I WANTED TO SHOW THE MARRIAGE OF THE TWO OF THEM. - NATALIE, IF YOU HAD TO CRITIQUE YOURSELF, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CHANGE OR ALTER? - I DEFINITELY WANTED TO DO A LOT MORE DETAIL ON THE BUTTERFLIES, BUT ALL OF THAT ASIDE, I AM STILL HAPPY WITH THE WAY THAT IT CAME OUT. - I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY YOU SHOULD WIN SKIN WARS. - I SHOULD WIN SKIN WARS BECAUSE I WILL TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO JUST MAKE MORE AND MORE AND MORE BODY ART. AND I WANT EVERYONE IN THE WORLD TO KNOW THAT BODY ART IS A LEGITIMATE, BEAUTIFUL FORM OF ART. IT WOULD JUST MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE. - AND DO YOU REALIZE HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO HAVING THE MONEY TO DO THAT? - I KNOW. SUPER CLOSE. - THANK YOU, NATALIE. - THANK YOU, GUYS. - OKAY, DUTCH, TELL US ABOUT YOUR CONCEPT AND YOUR PAINTINGS. - I CAME UP WITH A TITLE LAST NIGHT, PIECES OF ME. THE FRANKENSTEIN-ESQUE PIECE HERE HAS A LOT OF INPUT FROM MY ELDEST DAUGHTER. AND I WANTED TO CONVEY MY LOVE FOR HER IN THIS PIECE. THERE'S A BIT OF SYMBOLOGY-- KEEPING AN OPEN MIND AND THEN, OF COURSE, OPENING MY HEART. THIS PIECE HERE IS FOR MY YOUNGEST DAUGHTER AND MY WIFE. I WOULD NEVER CHOOSE PINK AS A COLOR TO PAINT AN ALIEN. BUT I KIND OF WANTED TO STAY AWAY FROM THE STUFF THAT I TYPICALLY DO. IT'S SO EASY FOR ME TO JUST BE A DUDE AND--AND PAINT SCARY STUFF, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, THAT COMES SO NATURALLY FOR ME. PEOPLE KNOW I CAN DO THAT STUFF. I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING THAT WAS SOFTER AND MORE PLEASANT. AND THEN THE BACK PIECE, THIS HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH MY GROWTH HERE AT SKIN WARS. AND EACH OF THESE ICONIC PICTURES REPRESENTS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD AN IMPACT ON ME SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. AS YOU KNOW, I GREW VERY CLOSE TO FELLE. WE PLAYED POOL EVERY NIGHT. THAT WAS HOW WE UNWOUND, AND THAT WAS OUR COPING MECHANISM FOR DEALING WITH THE STRESSES OF THE DAY. AND THEN MYTHICA DOWN HERE, AND THEN, OF COURSE, GEAR. AND THIS IS, YOU KNOW, LIGHTNING, ENERGY THAT GEAR LIKES TO RENDER A LOT. AND THEN THE--THE PALETTE IN THE MIDDLE WAS ALSO REPRESENTED BY MATCHING COLORS FROM EACH SEGMENT ON THE BACK AS THOUGH THOSE PAINTS WERE ADDED TO MY PALETTE. THEY--THEY ENHANCED ME. THEY--THEY GAVE ME MORE TO WORK WITH. AND IN KNOWING THEM AND--AND LEARNING FROM SIMPLY BEING WITH THEM, I FEEL LIKE I'VE BECOME A BETTER ARTIST, AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE OPENED UP MORE. - THIS COLOR SCHEME YOU SAID WAS INFLUENCED BY YOUR DAUGHTERS AND YOUR WIFE. - MM-HMM. - HAD THEY NOT COME, WOULD YOU HAVE STILL DONE THIS COLOR SCHEME? - I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OUTCOME. - THE BRAIN IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND THE WAY THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED THOSE FOLDS, THAT REALLY EFFECTIVELY MAKES IT LOOK LIKE IT'S PEELED BACK FROM HER HEAD. - WAS THERE A DEFINING MOMENT THAT CLICKED INSIDE OF YOUR HEAD THAT MADE THINGS CHANGE FOR YOU? - YEAH, THERE WAS THE CULMINATION OF THE JUDGMENTS THAT I WAS GETTING FROM YOU FOLKS THAT KIND OF CAME FROM SOMEBODY IN THIS COMPETITION THAT'S FEELING KIND OF GYPPED AND KIND OF ROBBED AT TIMES, AND THEN I-I WOULD STEW ON IT. AND AFTER THIS HAD HAPPENED SO MUCH, I WAS JUST LIKE, "HUH, MAYBE I'M WRONG." [laughter] AND IT BECAME EVIDENT VERY QUICKLY THAT I HAD TO CHANGE IT UP. - DUTCH, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU SHOULD WIN SKIN WARS? - I HAVE A LOT OF PAINTING ABILITY, AND I WORKED MY BUTT OFF. I PUT IN THE HOURS. I PUT IN THE TIME, AND THIS WOULD BE THE ULTIMATE VALIDATION TO BE SKIN WARS CHAMPION. AND MOST OF THAT PRIZE MONEY IS GOING TO PUT MY CHILDREN THROUGH COLLEGE. - THANK YOU SO MUCH, DUTCH. OKAY, SHANNON. - MY CONCEPT IS THE TWO DIVERSE SIDES OF MYSELF DURING MY TIME HERE AT SKIN WARS. THIS MODEL REPRESENTS THE MORE BENEVOLENT SIDE OF MYSELF. AND ON MY MORE EVIL SIDE, I WANTED TO SHOW THAT I CAN ALSO SHOW THIS TYPE OF ANGER-- SO THE FREEDOM VERSUS MY INNER ADVERSARY. AND WITHOUT THE BENEVOLENT SIDE, WITHOUT THE EVIL SIDE, THE BRAIN ON ART COULDN'T HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT'S A CONSTANT STRUGGLE BETWEEN WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG IN MY ARTWORK. - SO IT'S RIGHT-SIDE BRAIN, LEFT-SIDE BRAIN. - YOU'VE GOT IT. - WELL, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PAINTING. YOU'VE LEARNED HOW TO BRING YOUR FINE ART TOGETHER WITH YOUR BODY PAINTING. IT SEEMS THAT THAT'S HAPPENED, AND YOU SHOULD BE REALLY HAPPY WITH WHAT YOU'VE DONE. - THANK YOU. - I FEEL LIKE YOU, DURING THE COURSE OF THIS COMPETITION, HAVE STUMBLED UPON YOUR SIGNATURE STYLE. - I KNOW! THAT'S NUTS, ISN'T IT? - BRAVO. AND WOW. GREAT JOB. - THANK YOU. - DIAMONDS ARE FORMED UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE, AND I KNOW YOU KIDS HAVE BEEN UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE. AND I AGREE, I THINK YOU'VE FOUND YOUR DIAMOND. - THANK YOU. - SHANNON, WHY SHOULD YOU WIN SKIN WARS? - I THINK THAT WE ALL DESERVE TO WIN SKIN WARS. WHY DO I WANT TO WIN SKIN WARS? IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THE MONEY, HONESTLY, FOR ME. THERE'S JUST SO MUCH THAT I WANNA DO, AND I DON'T SEE A WAY THROUGH THE FOREST TO GET TO IT. AND IF I WERE TO WIN THE CHAMPIONSHIP, WHO CAN SAY WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN UNTIL YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION AND EACH DAY DISCOVER MORE AND MORE COOL THINGS? - THANK YOU SO MUCH, SHANNON. OKAY, YOU THREE, WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU. YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - I AM SUPER READY TO FIND OUT WHO THE WINNER IS. I'M ALMOST SAD THAT IT'S GONNA BE OVER. - SO WHAT DID YOU THINK? - IT WAS SO INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT THE PAINTERS DID WITH FREEDOM. - WHAT'D YOU THINK ABOUT DUTCH? - I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE BIRTH OF SOMETHING NEW FOR HIM. I FEEL LIKE HE'S REALLY TURNED A CORNER IN HIS CREATIVE PROCESS. AND HE'S ONTO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. - WAS THERE ENOUGH OF HIM IN THAT PIECE? - MM-HMM. - WAS IT DUTCH ENOUGH? - RIGHT, 'CAUSE HE WAS SAYING THAT HE WAS INSPIRED BY HIS DAUGHTERS. THE WIG WAS FOR ONE DAUGHTER. THE PINK WAS FOR HIS WIFE. - AND THEN ALL OF THE OTHER ARTISTS. - OR ARE ALL THOSE NEW INFLUENCES WHAT ELEVATED HIS PIECE: ALL THE NEW COLORS HE'S USING, THE PALETTE, THE FREEDOM, AND UNAPOLOGETIC USE OF HIS EMOTIONS? - I FEEL LIKE HE'S KIND OF IN THE MIDST OF A TRANSFORMATION RIGHT NOW, WHERE HIS WORK IS GONNA CHANGE. - YEAH. - BUT IS IT AN OVERALL SUCCESS... - MM-HMM. - WORTHY OF SKIN WARS CHAMPION? - RIGHT. - I BUSTED MY ASS MY WHOLE LIFE TO LEARN HOW TO PAINT THAT FRICKING GOOD. - HOW OLD ARE YOU? - 41. - OKAY. SO I'M 38, AND WE'VE PROBABLY BOTH BEEN DOING ART OUR WHOLE LIVES. - MM-HMM. - RIGHT. - WHAT'D YOU THINK ABOUT SHANNON? - I LOVE BEING ABLE TO WITNESS SHANNON'S FINDING HER THING. - I'M IN LOVE WITH THIS DRIPPING... - MM-HMM. - EXPRESSIVE BACKGROUND WITH HER REALLY GRAPHIC STYLE ON TOP OF IT. SHE'S REALLY ONTO SOMETHING. - HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE? - IT'S TOTALLY, UNIQUELY SHANNON. - I WAS GONNA SAY THAT THE FRONT WAS REALLY STRONG. - YES. - RIGHT, RIGHT. BECAUSE SHE HAD THE BRAIN ON THE BACK. - I LOVED THE FRONT, AND I LOVE HOW THERE'S SO MANY FUN LITTLE DETAILS TO DISCOVER. - THEN WHEN WE GO TO THE BACK, I JUST FELT LIKE THINGS GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE, UM... - BRAINY. - [laughs] - WAY--WAY TOO BRAINY FOR ME. SHRINKING THAT BRAIN DOWN IN SIZE, AS FAR AS THE COMPOSITION GOES, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE WORKED BETTER. - WELL, I KNOW THAT THEY FOUND SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH MY RENDERING, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GONNA JUDGE. - I HAVE NO IDEA. LET'S JUST BE [bleep] STOKED ON OURSELVES THAT WE-- - NO. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. - THAT WE DID IT, YOU KNOW? - YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. TOTALLY GRATEFUL. TOTALLY GRATEFUL. - IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS NOW. THIS ONE IS A COMPLETE WILD CARD TO ME. - SO NATALIE? - I LOVE HER STORIES AND HOW SHE INFUSES HERSELF AND HER EMOTIONS INTO HER PIECES, AND IT SHOWS. - YOU KNOW, SHE SAYS THAT HANDS ARE DIFFICULT FOR HER TO PAINT... - YEAH. - AND I WASN'T 100% HAPPY WITH HOW THE HANDS TURNED OUT ON THE BACK. YOU KNOW, IT WAS A LITTLE RUDIMENTARY. YOU KNOW, I DON'T FEEL LIKE... - YEAH. - SHE REALLY, YOU KNOW, NAILED IT ON THE HANDS. - RIGHT. I DON'T THINK SHE OVERPAINTED. I DON'T THINK SHE UNDERPAINTED. YOU KNOW, YES, SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE REALISM THAT SOMEONE LIKE DUTCH MIGHT HAVE IN PAINTING THE HANDS, BUT I DON'T THINK IT WAS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN THIS PIECE, BECAUSE THE PAINTING WAS SO DYNAMIC. ALL THREE OF THESE PAINTERS ARE HERE IN THIS FINALE FOR A REASON. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN HERE ONSTAGE TONIGHT. - WHO SHOWED US THE BEST TWO PAINTINGS TONIGHT? - IT'S ABOUT THE SKILL. IT'S ABOUT WHAT THEY DO WITH THEIR CANVAS AND THAT PAINT. - ONE WINNER. - OKAY, JUDGES, HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION? - YES. - IT'S DONE, YEAH. - ABSOLUTELY. - OKAY. PAINTERS, INCREDIBLE JOB TONIGHT. WHAT A GREAT SHOW. YOU'VE ALL GROWN SO MUCH OVER THIS COMPETITION, AND IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO GO ON THIS JOURNEY WITH YOU. BUT THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER. THE WINNER OF SKIN WARS  WILL RECEIVE A YEAR'S SUPPLY OF PAINT AND AN ALL-EXPENSE-PAID TRIP TO NEW YORK CITY TO BE A FEATURED GUEST PAINTER AT IMAX, ALL COURTESY OF MEHRON. THE WINNER WILL ALSO RECEIVE THEIR VERY OWN NATIONALLY DISTRIBUTED CUSTOM LINE OF PAINT BY EUROPEAN BODY ART AND A $100,000 CASH PRIZE. NATALIE, DUTCH, SHANNON, ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WINNER OF SKIN WARS. - NATALIE, DUTCH, SHANNON, ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE WINNER OF SKIN WARS. - ALL THREE OF YOU ARE AMAZING ARTISTS. - WATCHING YOU GO THROUGH THESE CHALLENGES HAS BEEN MY PLEASURE AND PRIVILEGE. - YOUR JOURNEY, YOUR VISION, YOUR TALENT, HAS INSPIRED PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, AND I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. - THANK YOU. - DUTCH, YOU HAVE CONSISTENTLY WOWED US WITH YOUR AMAZING ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND YOUR TRUE MASTERY OF BODY PAINTING TECHNIQUE. THE JUDGES WERE EXCITED TO SEE YOU OPEN UP AND PUSH YOURSELF IN A NEW DIRECTION FOR THIS CHALLENGE, BUT YOU MAY HAVE LOST A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF YOURSELF. THE JUDGES JUST DIDN'T SEE ENOUGH DUTCH IN YOUR PAINTINGS. DUTCH, I'M SORRY. YOU'RE NOT THE WINNER OF SKIN WARS. YOU MAY HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - I KNOW OFTEN I COME OFF AS COCKY AND, YOU KNOW-- BUT, I MEAN, EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN COPING MECHANISM. I FEEL LIKE I'VE LET MY DAUGHTERS DOWN. I'VE LET MYSELF DOWN BY NOT BRINGING MY "A" GAME. HEY, GUYS. - GOOD JOB. I'M INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED, AND I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE I DIDN'T PLAY IT SAFE. IT'S HARD CHEESE TO SWALLOW, BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S LIFE. - NATALIE, SHANNON, ONE OF YOU WILL BE THE FIRST-EVER SKIN WARS CHAMPION. NATALIE, YOU SAID THAT TODAY WAS YOUR FAVORITE DAY OF THE COMPETITION, AND IT SHOWED. YOUR PAINTINGS WERE DYNAMIC, HIGH CONTRAST, AND COHESIVE. SHANNON, THE JUDGES WERE SO IMPRESSED WITH THE AMOUNT OF INTRICATE, HAND-PAINTED DETAIL IN YOUR PIECE. AND WHEN YOUR MODELS TOOK THE RUNWAY, THE JUDGES IMMEDIATELY KNEW IT WAS YOUR PIECE. YOU DEFINITELY CAPTURED YOUR STYLE AS AN ARTIST. BOTH OF YOU PROVED YOU BELONG AT THE TOP. IT WAS SUCH A TOUGH DECISION, BUT IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS. THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE WINNER. SO WHO'S IT GONNA BE? [rock music] ♪ ♪ THE ANSWER YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR IS PAINTED ON THESE MODELS' BACKS. THE FIRST-EVER SKIN WARS CHAMPION IS... NATALIE! CONGRATULATIONS! WHOO!
