[laughter] - SINCE DAY ONE, YOU'VE ALL FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO STAY IN THIS COMPETITION. - I WON THE LAST CHALLENGE, SO I'M FINALLY GETTING SOME RECOGNITION. I'M FEELING PRETTY ON POINT TO TACKLE THIS NEXT ONE. - FOR TODAY'S CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE WRESTLING YOUR WAY TO THE TOP. BUT DON'T WORRY, YOU WON'T LITERALLY BE WRESTLING. WE BROUGHT IN PROFESSIONALS FOR THAT. [dramatic music] - THESE SILHOUETTES POP UP, AND THEY ALL LOOK LIKE BIG, BURLY WRESTLERS.

I WANT IT TO BE LIGHTNING BOLTS [imitates electricity] DISPERSING FROM HIS BACK AND GOING INTO HIS ARMS. I'VE NEVER PAINTED A SMALL WRESTLER BEFORE, SO FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING IN THIS COMPETITION. - OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? MY WRESTLER IS EL MATADOR. HE IS A BULLFIGHTER. MAYBE THE "M" WITH FIRE AROUND IT. I WANT HIM TO HAVE A GREAT LOGO AND ALSO DO A MASK BASED ON HIS ORIGINAL MASK HE WAS WEARING. - IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COMPLETELY SEPARATES YOU FROM ANY OTHER WRESTLER ON THE PLANET? - WELL, I LIKE TO SING ELVIS. - YOU LIKE TO SING ELVIS? - YEAH. - THAT'S AWESOME. MY CONCEPT IS FIND OUT FROM MY WRESTLER WHAT HE WANTS. - MIGHTY MIKE HAS SO MANY IDEAS. - I WANT A GRENADE. LET'S MAKE IT LIKE I CAME OUT OF A SWAMP. - HE KEEPS THROWING THINGS AT ME. SO I FEEL LIKE NOW I'M STARTING TO RUN OUT OF TIME. YOU GOT SOME BIG IDEAS. WE ONLY HAVE TWO HOURS, MIGHTY MIKE. - OH, WE GOT IT. - I'M GONNA GIVE YOU, LIKE, A DEVIL BEARD, AND I'M GONNA PAINT HORNS ON YOU. MY WRESTLER IS THE DARK SPAWN. THIS IS GONNA LOOK REALLY BADASS BACK HERE. IN THE LAST CHALLENGE, MY PIECE WAS THE WEAKEST PIECE. I'VE GOTTA FIND MY VOICE AS A PAINTER. I'M GONNA MAKE THIS HAVE GLOWING EYES LIKE YOU DO RIGHT NOW. - OH, BEAUTIFUL. - HE'S THE RICH GUY. HE'S KINDA LIKE "NATURE BOY" RIC FLAIR. MY WRESTLER'S SHOWBOAT. I'M WANTING VERY STRONG OBVIOUS WRESTLING CUES. CLOSE YOUR EYES JUST FOR SAFETY. IT NEEDS TO BE FLASHY, SO I'M THINKING LOTS OF GLITTER ON THIS ONE. THIS IS A BIGGER-THAN-LIFE CHARACTER SO I'M THINKING DIAMONDS, GOLD, AND MONEY. THIS IS GONNA BE AWESOME. [upbeat music] - LIKE, DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT-DIT, LIKE [cracking tongue]. - GEAR'S SOUND EFFECTS ARE SO FUNNY. - [high-pitched beeping] [imitating gunfire, explosions] AW. SHEE. - YA-WOW! I CAN'T DO IT, REALLY. - OH, THIS IS BACKWARDS. SO WE'RE GOING BACKWARDS? - I WANT IT BACKWARDS, YEAH. I LOVE IT. IT'S CRAZY. OH, MY GOD! HE LOOKS HORRIFYING. NO. - MORE BLOOD. - HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE THE GOOD GUY. HE WANTS TO BE MORE SERIAL KILLER. MAYBE I LISTENED TO MIGHTY MIKE A LITTLE TOO MUCH. - [growls] - ALL RIGHT, GUYS, CHECK IT OUT. WE GOT FIVE MINUTES! - THE LAST FIVE MINUTES OF THE CHALLENGE I NOTICED THAT MY LETTERS GET SMALLER AS THEY GO ACROSS THE BACK, SO I'M FREAKING OUT. - I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS, BECAUSE I GOT A LOT OF LITTLE DETAILS THAT I GOTTA TIDY UP TO MAKE THIS WORK. - ONE MINUTE! - AAH! - OKAY, PAINTERS, THAT'S IT. TIME'S UP. PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. - THIS IS GONNA BE A HARD COMPETITION TODAY. ALL THESE WRESTLERS LOOK AMAZING. - COME ON, LET'S GET YOUR FIGHT ON! FOLLOW ME. [cheers and applause] - AWESOME. - SO YOU READY FOR A BEATDOWN? - YEAH. IT'S WAR! [bell dings] - UP FIRST, HE'S LIGHTNING FAST. HE'S HIGH VOLTAGE!

SO I'M FEELING PRETTY SOLID ABOUT THIS. - HI, SHANNON. - TELL US ABOUT YOUR WRESTLER. - THIS IS THE DARK SPAWN. HIS CHARACTER IS THE GRIM REAPER. ON THE BACK, YOU CAN SEE THE WINGSPAN OF THE DEVIL. - I LOVE THE WINGS. - REALLY GOOD RENDERING. - THANK YOU. - MY WRESTLER IS SHOWBOAT. - I LOVE THAT GRADATION OF THE GLITTER, VERY NICE. - YEAH, AND I THOUGHT, IF ANYTHING WAS GONNA BE FLASHY, IT WOULD BE A BIG-TIME WRESTLER. - DUTCH HAS DEFINITELY CAUGHT THE GLITTER BUG. I'M GONNA TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT. - SO YOU GOT EL MATADOR. - YOUR LETTERING, IT LOOKS LIKE IT STARTED OUT ONE SIZE AND FINISHED ANOTHER. - WITH THE TIME CRUNCH, YOU KNOW, I HAD TO GO WITH IT. - THAT'S NOT GONNA FLY WITH ME. - HI, GUYS. NOT TOO CLOSE. HE'S CRAZY. - OH, OH. - THIS IS MIGHTY MIKE.

IT'S JUST THE POSITION OF IT. - PLACEMENT. THE CHEST PIECE IS A MUCH STRONGER PLACE TO PUT SOMETHING THAN THE TUMMY. - YOU LIKE THE BACK OF IT. - LOVE THE BACK, THE WINGS. - HOW ABOUT GEAR? - IT FELT LIKE A THEATRICAL PIECE. - THERE IS A CERTAIN AESTHETIC THAT REMINDS ME OF HIGH FASHION. - STYLE. - AND STYLE. - HE UNDERSTANDS STYLE. - ABSOLUTELY. - WHAT ABOUT DUTCH? - GLITTER. - GLITTER. - DUTCH USED GLITTER. - THE SILHOUETTE, TO ME, FELT LIKE A WRESTLER. DUTCH WAS VERY, VERY SMART IN THAT DEPARTMENT. - ALL RIGHT, SHOULD WE GO TALK TO THE PAINTERS? - LET'S GET BACK IN THE RING. - [clicks tongue] - GREAT JOB TODAY. - THANK YOU. - GEAR. AND DUTCH.

CONGRATULATIONS. - YAY! - GOOD JOB. - DUN, DUN, DUN! [imitates crowd cheering] I'M ON A WINNING STREAK HERE, AND I'M FEELING PRETTY DAMN GOOD ABOUT IT. - I'M PERPLEXED. GEAR'S GUY DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A WRESTLER. AND I'M JUST KINDA TRYING TO BE COOL ABOUT IT AND--AND NOT GET AGGRAVATED. - AS THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE, YOU HAVE WON YOUR VERY OWN SET OF AIRBRUSH GUNS AND A COMPRESSOR FROM ANEST IWATA AIRBRUSH COMPANY. - YES!

[dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - [grunts] HIYA! - SUMO! - YEAH! [cheers and applause] - SUMO. MY DREAM HAS COME TRUE. - THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT? - YEAH! WHOO! - YEAH! - I'VE NEVER SEEN A SUMO WRESTLER IN REAL LIFE. THIS IS AMAZING. - HERE WE GO FROM PAINTING A SUPER-SMALL DUDE TO, LIKE, A FREAKIN' MAMMOTH. - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH ALL THAT CANVAS? - [laughs] - CHALLENGE ACCEPTED. - SUMO IS A 2,000-YEAR-OLD JAPANESE MARTIAL ART THAT WAS CREATED AS ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE GODS. FOR THIS CONCEPT CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE TURNING YOUR MODEL INTO A BEAUTIFUL WARRIOR. - I MEAN, THAT'S A LOT OF CANVAS TO WORK ON. THIS IS GONNA BE AN AMAZING CHALLENGE. - YOUR MODELS HAVE BEEN RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR YOU. YOU WILL HAVE FOUR HOURS TO COMPLETE THIS HEAD-TO-TOE, FRONT AND BACK LOOK. - I GOTTA PAINT A FREAKIN' GIANT IN FOUR HOURS? [sighs] [bleep] THERE'S JUST NO WAY. - THAT'S FREAKIN' CRAZY. - YEAH. [laughs] - NO EXCUSES. HONOR THE WARRIORS HERE. - GOOD NIGHT, PAINTERS, AND GOOD LUCK. - GOOD LUCK. YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT. [upbeat dance music] - I'LL TAKE IT OFF THE RAIL, AND THEN I'LL GET A NICE BALANCE? [whooshes] OH, DAMN IT. WE STARTED AT TEN, AND WE'RE NOW FIVE. THE HOUSE IS GETTING MORE EMPTY. TENSION IS HIGHER. THE CHALLENGES ARE GETTING HARDER. EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE STARVING FOR A DISTRACTION RIGHT NOW, SOMETHING TO KIND OF TAKE THEIR MIND OFF OF IT. - I REALLY WANT TO, LIKE, TELL A STORY WITH THIS ONE. - I GOT A PRETTY SOLID IDEA OF WHERE YOU WANNA GO WITH IT. NATALIE AND I ARE FRIENDS, YOU KNOW, AND ARTISTIC, YOU KNOW, CREATIVE BUDDIES. NATALIE'S SOMEONE THAT I THINK HIGHLY OF HERE. - I WANT THIS TO BE PERFECT, AND THEN I-- SOMETIMES I'LL FORGET TO, LIKE, THROW IN, YOU KNOW, THOSE LITTLE TWISTS THAT ARE-- THAT HAVE KEPT ME HERE. GEAR IS PROBABLY MY BEST FRIEND IN THE HOUSE. WE BOTH JUST KIND OF LIKE GET EACH OTHER. AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE HOUSE THAT YOU CAN JUST GET REAL WITH, INSTEAD OF BEING SUPERCOMPETITIVE. TO TOMORROW. - HELL YEAH. [upbeat electronic music] - [sighs] - I'M GONNA NEED A BIGGER STATION THAN THIS. THE IDEA OF PAINTING A SUMO WRESTLER IS AWESOME. I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING INTO BATTLE. BUT THESE CHALLENGES KEEP GETTING HARDER AND HARDER WITH LESS AND LESS TIME. - WHOO! - YEAH! - WHEN THE SUMO WRESTLERS COME OUT, THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE ENTIRE PLACE CHANGES. - HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. - HAMA. - HAMA. HAMA. - YOU CAN FEEL POWER. YOU CAN FEEL HONOR AS IF IT'S A REAL LIQUID THING FLOATING IN THE ETHER. - SAKE? NO. [laughs] - I'M EXCITED. - ME, TOO. - HAVE YOU EVER BEEN BODY PAINTED? - NO. FIRST TIME. - NO? - FREAKING MADNESS. YOU GOTTA THINK ABOUT, LIKE, PRIMING A COMFORTER. THAT'S HOW MUCH SKIN WE'RE WORKING WITH. THAT SHOULDN'T TAKE ANY LESS THAN AN HOUR. - I'M GONNA HAVE YOU LAY DOWN ON THESE TOWELS. DOES THAT SOUND OKAY WITH YOU? WITH FOUR HOURS, HOW AM I GONNA PAINT THIS BASE COAT ON THIS SUMO WRESTLER IN UNDER 30 MINUTES? I WANT TO PAINT YOUR CHEST, SO LAY ON YOUR BACK. - OKAY. - OR WE'LL PAINT YOUR BACK FIRST. WHAT I REALLY WANNA DO IS TO TRANSLATE WHAT I DO WITH MY FINE ART ON MY BODY PAINTINGS. I THINK ABOUT WHAT I WOULD BE DOING IN MY STUDIO. WHEN I HAVE A LARGE CANVAS, I LAY IT ON THE GROUND AND I DUMP PAINT ON IT. HOW ELSE AM I SUPPOSED TO COVER A SUMO IN ONE HOUR? [upbeat dance music] - MY MIND IS COVERAGE MODE. I HAVE PAINTED ONE REALLY LARGE GUY BEFORE. AND IT TOOK ME OVER AN HOUR JUST TO GET THE BASE COAT DOWN. ALL RIGHT, LEGS ARE GOOD ENOUGH. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS COMPETITION, I'M--I'M FEELING TIME PRESSURE. - YOU NEED A BREAK? BATHROOM? OKAY. MY APPROACH TODAY IS VERY DIFFERENT. I DON'T NORMALLY GET THE CHANCE TO GET THIS PERSONAL IN MY WORK. MY CONCEPT TODAY IS THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. WE ARE ALL WARRIORS IN THIS FIGHT FOR EQUALITY. MY GIRLFRIEND JENNIFER AND I HAVE ALWAYS HAD TO BATTLE TO BE ACCEPTED. THIS IS GOING TO BE TWO DUELING DRAGONS, SUPERBRIGHT COLORS. I CHOOSE TO DO TWO DRAGONS ON THE FRONT REPRESENTING HOW WE ARE ALL THE SAME AND THAT WE ARE ALL EQUAL. - RAINBOW SUMO FUN TIME. - HE LOOKS LIKE A MULTICOLORED OTTER POP. - THE CONCEPT THAT I WANNA BRING FORTH TODAY IS BASED IN THE SUPERNATURAL ELEMENTS OF THE JAPANESE WARRIOR MYTHOLOGIES. - [growls] - YEAH! - TURN AROUND. MY CONCEPT FOR THIS CHALLENGE IS ANCIENT JAPANESE 16TH-CENTURY SHOGUN WARRIOR. KINDA LIKE ANYTHING A LA LAST SAMURAI. I SEE YOUR FIGHTING STYLE IS KIND OF WEAK. COMING OFF A 2-TIME WINNING STREAK, AND THIRD TIME'S A CHARM. I'M DEFINITELY GONNA TAKE THIS ONE. - [growls] - [laughs] - I'VE ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT MY BIGGEST COMPETITION WAS GONNA BE GEAR. BUT HE'S GETTING MAYBE A LITTLE TOO COCKY. - IT IS TRADITION. both: [laugh] [upbeat dance music] - SO ARE YOU MARRIED OR IS IT A GIRLFRIEND? - MARRIED. - MARRIED? MY CONCEPT IS THE SOFTER SIDE OF WAR. WHAT I'M GOING FOR IS BEAUTIFUL WARRIOR. NOT NECESSARILY WAR ITSELF, IT'S MORE WHAT THEY'RE MISSING AT HOME. HE'S MISSING HIS WIFE. HE'S MISSING HIS HOME. HE'S MISSING HIS FAVORITE TREE. AND IT KIND OF LIKE GIVES HIM THIS WARM, BEAUTIFUL FEELING. I WANT TO USE YOUR WOMAN AS THAT, LIKE, CROSSOVER ILLUSION SORT OF THING. [laughter] - WE GOT ONE HOUR. GET CRACKIN'. - THIS PIECE IS THE WARRIORS FIGHTING EACH OTHER, NOT UNLIKE THIS COMPETITION. MY CONCEPT IS SKIN WARRIORS. SO NICOLE AND NATALIE ARE BEAUTIFUL GEISHAS ON THE FRONT OF THE LEG. GEAR'S KIND OF LIKE LOOKING UP, AND I PUT DUTCH RIGHT ON THE BUTT SO THAT HE CAN GET SQUASHED. - I DON'T USUALLY GET EXCITED ABOUT MY OWN STUFF, BUT THIS PIECE I'M DOING ON YOUR BACK RIGHT NOW IS REALLY FRICKIN' GORGEOUS. I'M TAKING SOME TIME TO REALLY FOCUS ON THE BACK, INSTEAD OF THE FRONT, BECAUSE I WANT THAT TO BE THE FOCAL POINT. I PROBABLY SHOULD NOT HAVE TRIED THIS MUCH DETAIL. THE BACK IS GOOD VERSUS EVIL WITH THE PHOENIX BEING ON TOP AND THE JAPANESE DEMONS UNDERNEATH. [upbeat dance music] ♪ ♪ - I WANT THAT FACE TO REALLY WOW THE JUDGES. I'M USING MY NEW SET OF SKILLS THAT I'VE ACQUIRED OVER THE COURSE OF THIS COMPETITION. I CHOOSE TO PAINT MY EYES OPEN, INDICATING OPEN-MINDEDNESS, WHICH IS REALLY WHAT THIS CONCEPT IS ABOUT. - I DON'T SPEND A WHOLE LOT OF TIME WITH THE FACE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE BATTLE ARMOR AND TACTFULLY BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH CERTAIN THINGS IN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME. - GEAR'S PIECE IS NOT THE MOST IMPRESSIVE. I'M THINKING, GEAR, LIKE, GUH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? LOOKS LIKE A NINJA TURTLE. - [laughing] - MY SUMO, BYAMBA, KEEPS LAUGHING, WHICH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PAINT HIM. - [laughing] - BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT THE AIRBRUSH IS ACTUALLY TICKLING HIM, AND THAT'S WHY HE'S LAUGHING. - [laughing] - ALL RIGHT, GUYS, CHECK IT OUT. WE GOT TEN MINUTES. LET'S DO IT TO IT. - [bleep] - AAH! - WAH! - [laughs] YEAH. - I AM LOOKING DOWN AT THIS BEAUTIFUL MAWASHI. I DON'T WANNA TOUCH IT. IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. I LOOK AROUND, AND I SEE EVERYONE ELSE PAINTING THEIR MAWASHIS, BUT I MAKE THE CONSCIOUS DECISION NOT TO PAINT IT. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ - OKAY, PAINTERS. TIME'S UP! PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN! - WHOO! - I'M WORRIED BECAUSE THE JUDGES MIGHT THINK IT'S TOO SIMPLE. AND I THINK THAT THEY MIGHT THINK THAT I DIDN'T TIME MANAGE WELL ENOUGH. BUT IT'S TOO LATE. I CAN'T CHANGE ANYTHING NOW. - WELCOME, PAINTERS. - HELLO. - HEY. - FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU HAD FOUR HOURS TO TURN YOUR WRESTLER INTO A BEAUTIFUL AND HEROIC WARRIOR. YOU ALL KNOW OUR ESTEEMED JUDGES-- CRAIG TRACY... - HELLO, PAINTERS. - ROBIN SLONINA... - HI, GUYS. - AND RUPAUL CHARLES. - HEY! - HI. - HEY. - LET THE GRAND SHOW BEGIN. [samisen music] ♪ ♪ - I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD. THE PIECE JUST POPS ONSTAGE, AND THAT FACE. I AM SO HAPPY ABOUT WHAT I DID TODAY. [upbeat rock music] - I'M JUST ELATED. HE'S FOCUSED, AND THE COLORS ARE JUST VIBRANT AND POPPING STILL. HIS FACE IS PERFECT. [somber music] - THE GUYS LOOKS FREAKING COOL. I MEAN, I'M FEELING IT. THIS ONE'S REALLY WORKING. ♪ ♪ I DID THESE COOL, LIKE, BATTLE WARRIOR SHOGUN FEATHERS. HE'S JUST EXPLODING ON THE STAGE. [electronic music] - HE'S FANTASTIC, AND HE'S COVERED WITH THIS SICK PAINT JOB. THIS TIME, I REALLY DID INCORPORATE MY FINE ART INTO MY BODY PAINTING. THIS GREAT POURING AND DRIPPING AND SPILLING TECHNIQUE, I FORESEE ME USING THAT IN ALL OF MY UPCOMING WORK. I'M SUPER HAPPY. [upbeat rock music] - I'M WORRIED, YEAH, FOR SURE. THIS IS NOT MY BEST, BUT YOU KNOW, THE MORE I LOOK AT IT, I KIND OF LIKE THE WAY THAT MINE LOOKS. ♪ ♪ YES, MY PIECE IS THE MOST SIMPLE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I'M STILL HAPPY WITH THE WAY TODAY WENT. - ALL RIGHT. - WHOO! - NICOLE, COME ON UP. - HI, BYAMBA. - THE FACE ON YOUR MODEL IS OUTSTANDING. - YOUR MODEL IS SO EFFECTIVE AT CHANGING THE EXPRESSION OF IT, OH, YEAH. YOU TOOK YOUR TECHNIQUE TO A NEW LEVEL. WHY DIDN'T YOU PAINT THE MAWASHI YOUR MODEL'S WEARING? - I THINK IT HAS A BEAUTY IN ITSELF. AND I REALLY WANTED TO LEAVE THAT UNTOUCHED. - YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE BROTHERS FROM ANOTHER MOTHER... - YEAH. - FOR SOME REASON. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS BACK IS PHENOMENAL. THE DETAIL AND HIGHLIGHTS AND SHADOWS, IT'S JUST BLOWING MY MIND. I ALMOST WISH THERE WAS MORE DETAIL LIKE THAT ON THE FRONT. - WELL, GIVEN WE HAD THE FOUR HOURS, I DID WANT A GOOD, STRONG FOCAL POINT. - I WANTED TO PORTRAY MY TEAMMATES. THIS IS GEAR. THIS IS DUTCH ON THE BUTT. [laughter and applause] AND THIS IS NATALIE AND NICOLE. - THE FINE ART ELEMENT TO THIS MASTERPIECE IS SO REFRESHING. - THANK YOU. - THE BACK PIECE--BOOM! - I WASN'T SO SURE ABOUT THE DARKNESS OF THE FACE. I WOULD'VE BROUGHT SOME MORE LIGHT IN THERE. BUT EVERY LITTLE BIT OF IT IS TELLING MORE OF A STORY. TOTALLY RAD. SHANNON, MAMA, WELL DID. - THANK YOU. - WHAT'S UP, MAN? - HE HAS A GREAT SILHOUETTE. I LOVE THE FEATHERS. - I LOVE THOSE SCALES. - AND I ALSO WAS ABLE TO BUILD UP THE ARMOR ON HIS PIECE RIGHT THERE. - I WASN'T SUPER SATISFIED ON THE FACE. - MM. - IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE YOU RAN OUT OF TIME OR SOMETHING. - YOU KNOW, THE CLOCK GOES, DO-DO-DO-DO, YOU KNOW, GOING DOWN AND JUST RACING AGAINST THE CLOCK. - I DECIDED TO KIND OF PORTRAY THE SOFT WARRIOR, THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE MISSING. - SHE BROUGHT THE SOFT, TENDER SIDE. - AW. - [laughs] - I LOVE THESE COLORS. SOMETIMES YOU REMEMBER A PLACE IN THOSE SOFTER TONES LIKE THAT. - THE LITTLE SURPRISE WITH THE ARMS, REALLY SMART, BUT ALL OF THE TECHNICAL THINGS ARE FRUSTRATING. I FEEL YOU CAN DO BETTER. - I LOVE YOUR STORY, BUT IT'S--IT IS SIMPLE. - "SIMPLE," I KNOW, IS JUST, LIKE, A CURSED WORD HERE, AND I WASN'T REALLY GOING FOR, LIKE, SIMPLE. I WAS GOING FOR, LIKE, SUBTLE. YOU KNOW, I USED EVERY LAST SECOND OF TIME. - THANK YOU, NATALIE. - THANKS. - THANK YOU, PAINTERS. THE JUDGES HAVE A LOT TO TALK ABOUT. YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - BYE, GUYS. [whistles] - I THINK WE ALL PULLED SOME MIRACLES TODAY, GUYS. - AND I'M A LITTLE JEALOUS. I'M LIKE, I SHOULD HAVE POURED [bleep] ALL OVER MINE. I LIKE MY DESIGN, BUT IT MIGHT BE TOO SIMPLE FOR WHAT THE JUDGES ARE LOOKING FOR. I'M REALLY WORRIED. - SO, JUDGES, WHAT'D YOU THINK OF THE WORK? - NICOLE--I DIDN'T KNOW SHE HAD THAT IN HER. - AND THAT FACE. - OH, MY GOODNESS. - MAGIC. - BY FAR, THE BEST FACE. - NOW, SHE MADE THE CHOICE TO NOT PAINT THE-- - MAWASHI. - MM-HMM. YEAH, VISUALLY, MAYBE IT WASN'T AS STRONG AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN. - DUTCH--THE BACK OF HIS PAINTING, [imitates explosion]. - YEAH. - YEAH, WHEN HE TURNED, WHAT WAS MY "WOW" MOMENT. - YES. - I ALMOST WISH THE BACK WAS ON THE FRONT. - LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION. - SHANNON. - SHE TOOK A BIG CHANCE WITH THIS TECHNIQUE. - BUT THE RISK REALLY PAID OFF, AND IT CREATED THIS BEAUTIFUL BACKGROUND... - DREAMY. - FOR, THEN, THIS REALLY STRONG GRAPHIC STYLE ON TOP OF IT. - YEAH. - IT MADE YOUR EYES DANCE. WHICH LEAVES GEAR AND NATALIE DOWN BELOW. NOW, GEAR'S PIECE, HE PAINTED THE MAWASHI TO FIT WITH THE ARMOR. - MY FAVORITE WAS THE SCALES, BUT IT WAS OVER TO THE SIDE SO YOU COULDN'T EVEN REALLY SEE IT. UNLESS THE MODEL CONTORTED. - RIGHT. - THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A FOCAL POINT. THAT STUFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHIFTED. - THE FACE WAS HEAVILY UNDERPAINTED. - IT ALMOST SEEMED TO ME LIKE HE DIDN'T FINISH IT. - NATALIE'S PIECE. - MM-HMM. - SHE APPROACHED HER WARRIOR FROM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANGLE, AND THAT WAS REALLY REFRESHING. - BUT THERE WAS A SIMPLICITY COMPARED TO THE OTHERS. - LESS IS MORE HERE. I'M NOT BUYING IT. SHE COULD MAKE THAT PAINTING BETTER. - GEAR AND NATALIE. - THERE'S TWO WEAK LINKS, AND I FEEL LIKE THEY DIDN'T FINISH SOMEHOW. I--SO I DON'T KNOW HOW TO JUDGE IT. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. - THIS WAS, BY FAR, YOUR STRONGEST CHALLENGE YET. YOU'VE PROVEN WITH YOUR IMPECCABLE WORK THAT THERE'S A REASON THAT YOU ARE THE FINAL FIVE. BUT AT THE END OF TONIGHT, FIVE WILL BECOME FOUR. DUTCH. YOU ARE SAFE. YOU MAY HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. SHANNON, NICOLE, PLEASE STEP FORWARD. CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE TOP TWO. - IT FEELS SO GOOD TO BE IN THE TOP TWO. I FEEL LIKE I HONORED MY SUMO AND ALSO HONORED MY STATEMENT TODAY. I HAVEN'T WON A BIG CHALLENGE YET, AND I'M SO READY. NICOLE, SHANNON, THIS WAS THE CLOSEST RACE YET. SHANNON. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE THE WINNER. - THANK YOU. - I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU. - SHANNON, YOU TOOK A HUGE RISK USING SUCH AN UNCONVENTIONAL TECHNIQUE IN LAYING DOWN YOUR BASE COAT. BUT THE RISK PAID OFF, BECAUSE YOUR PAINTING WAS FIERCE. - THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. I'M SUPER HONORED. IT FEELS AWESOME. - CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU BOTH. YOU MAY HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - THANK YOU. - I KNOW... AWESOME! THIS HAS TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT SKIN WARS CHALLENGE THAT WE'VE HAD TO DATE, AND I WON IT. [suspenseful music] - NATALIE, GEAR, YOU ARE THE BOTTOM TWO. - I'M PRETTY SHOCKED. I'M A LITTLE PISSED. I FEEL LIKE I DID A STRONG PIECE. WHETHER THEY LIKE IT OR NOT, I KNOW I DID A STRONG PIECE. - OH, I WANNA TAKE THEM BOTH HOME WITH ME. - I KNOW. - THIS WAS, BY FAR, THE MOST DIFFICULT DELIBERATION THE JUDGES HAVE EVER HAD, SO MUCH SO, THE JUDGES WERE DIVIDED. THEY COULD NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON WHO SHOULD GO HOME. - WHAT THE HELL IS GONNA HAPPEN? - THIS WAS, BY FAR, THE MOST DIFFICULT DELIBERATION THE JUDGES HAVE EVER HAD, SO MUCH SO, THAT THEY COULD NOT COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON WHO SHOULD GO HOME. THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD A PAINT OFF. - [gasps] - OH, MY GOSH. - RIGHT NOW? - RIGHT NOW. YOU WILL GET ONE LAST CHANCE TO PROVE YOU ARE THE ONE WHO DESERVES TO STAY. YOU WILL HAVE 30 MINUTES TO PAINT YOUR MODELS RIGHT HERE IN FRONT OF THE JUDGES. GEAR, YOUR MODEL'S FACE LOOKED UNFINISHED. AND YOUR PIECE LACKED A FOCAL POINT ON THE FRONT. NATALIE, YOU CREATED AN ALLURING PIECE THAT TOLD A BEAUTIFUL STORY. BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE COMPETITION, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR SUBTLETY. - THINK OF IT AS YOUR REPRIEVE FROM THE GOVERNOR. - LOOK AT THIS 30 MINUTES AS A GIFT AND USE ALL OF IT WISELY. - GEAR VERSUS NATALIE RIGHT NOW. - WELL, THIS IS BONKERS. - THIS IS SO COOL. - I'M STUCK IN A REALLY HARD POSITION. THEY'RE PUTTING ME IN A RING WITH A REALLY GOOD FRIEND. HERE'S A KNIFE ON THE TABLE. OKAY, GREAT. YOU GUYS GOTTA STAB EACH OTHER TO DEATH. - THIS IS THE WORST ELIMINATION SCENARIO, BECAUSE GEAR IS MY BEST FRIEND IN THE HOUSE. - WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT? - WE'RE JUST GOOD FRIENDS. IT FEELS WEIRD. - YOU'RE PAINTING TO STAY. MAYBE THINK ABOUT THAT. - OKAY, NATALIE AND GEAR, THE PAINT OFF AND YOUR 30 MINUTES STARTS NOW. - OH, MY GOSH. - THIS IS NUTS. - THIS IS SO JUICY RIGHT NOW. - GET IT, NAT. - GO, GEAR.

MY CONCEPT, I'M CHANGING IT TO THE MOMENT THE WARRIOR LEAVES. - OH, GOOD. - OKAY. - OKAY. - THAT IS ONE THING I LOVE ABOUT NATALIE. SHE'S WRITING THE STORY WHILE SHE'S PAINTING. - YEAH. - I DON'T PAINT AGAINST MY FRIENDS OR THE PEOPLE I CARE ABOUT. SO NOT ONLY AM I IN A BATTLE WITHIN THE COMPETITION, BUT NOW I'M IN A BATTLE WITHIN MYSELF OF, WHAT DO I DO? [whispers] I DON'T FIND ANY HONOR IN THIS. I WOULD RATHER BE SENT HOME THAN HAVE TO PAINT AGAINST ONE OF MY FRIENDS. - THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. - YOU'RE RIGHT. - WE ARE HERE TO PAINT AGAINST ONE ANOTHER. THAT MEANS THEY NEED TO BRING IT. - WHAT IF IT WAS YOU AND I UP THERE RIGHT NOW? - YOU'RE GOING DOWN. - EXACTLY. - 15 MINUTES, GUYS. 15 MINUTES. - MM-HMM. - JUST TAKING MY TIME. - HE'S JUST GONNA TOUCH UP WHAT HE ALREADY DID. OH, MY GOD. I WANNA GRAB HIM BY THE SHIRT AND SLAP HIM IN THE FACE AND SAY, "DUDE, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? IT'S A DISHONOR TO NOT DO YOUR BEST." PAINT! - FIVE MINUTES, GUYS. FIVE MINUTES LEFT. - THAT'S GREAT. - GO FOR IT. - OKAY. - [gasps] OH, SHE MADE A KISS ON HIS CHEEK. - AW. - YEAH, NATALIE'S TRYING RIGHT NOW. - YEAH, SHE IS. - NATALIE AND GEAR, YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT. - THAT'S COOL BY ME. - I KNEW IT WAS A MISTAKE FOR GEAR TO GET TOO CLOSE TO HER. - HOW MUCH LESS SENSITIVE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE THAN SOMEONE LIKE GEAR? - I AM SENSITIVE ON THE INSIDE, BUT THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THAT IN A COMPETITION. - BUT YOU INTERNALIZE IT, AND GEAR EXTERNALIZES IT. - FANTASTIC. HE'S LOSING. I'M MAD. I'M DISAPPOINTED. HE IS THROWING IT, AND IT'S KILLING ME TO WATCH IT. - FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE. TIME'S UP. PLEASE STEP FORWARD. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ NATALIE, YOU CAN GO FIRST. - I DECIDED TO CHANGE THE FEEL OF MY PIECE TO BE SLIGHTLY MORE SOLEMN. THEY HAVE JUST SAID GOOD-BYE, AND HE'S ON HIS WAY OFF TO BATTLE. I ADDED A FEW TEARS AND PUT THE RED LIPS KISS ON HIS CHEEK, BECAUSE SHE JUST SAID GOOD-BYE. AND INSTEAD OF THE SUN, I CHANGED IT TO A HOLE IN HIS CHEST, 'CAUSE WHEN YOU SAY GOOD-BYE TO SOMEONE, IT JUST FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY JUST, LIKE, RIPS YOUR CHEST OPEN. YEAH, TURN AROUND. AND A SMALL SILHOUETTE OF HIS WIFE BY HERSELF. SO THAT'S WHAT I DID. - THANK YOU. GEAR. - [sighs] I, UH... [chuckles] I ADDED THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS, YOU KNOW, UM-- - AND WHAT ABOUT THE FACE? - ASIDE FROM, OBVIOUSLY, ADDING MORE DETAIL, THAT'S ALL I FELT LIKE DOING. - SERIOUSLY, GEAR? - THAT'S A TOWEL THROWN INTO THE RING. - DID HE NOT COME HERE TO WIN? - THERE IS NO HONOR FOR ME IN-- IN THIS PAINT OFF. IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. THE LAST THING I WANNA DO IS CHALLENGE A FRIEND. IT'S NOT THE WAY I FEEL LIKE I NEED-- - OKAY. OKAY. LET'S JUST BREAK IT DOWN, OKAY? - TELL HIM, RUPAUL. - LET'S JUST BREAK IT DOWN. - HERE WE GO. - THEY'RE ABOUT TO GET SPANKED. - I'M ACTUALLY DISAPPOINTED. IT'S NOT ABOUT BAD OR GOOD OR RIGHT OR WRONG. IT'S ABOUT THE COMPETITION. IT'S THE GAME. - YOU HAD 30 MINUTES TO MAKE YOUR PAINTINGS BETTER. THAT'S A GIFT, AND I SAID THAT. - EACH OF THESE SUMO WRESTLERS COULD TELL YOU THE EXACT SAME THING. THERE IS HONOR IN DEFEAT. THERE IS HONOR IN WINNING. SO THIS MOPEY ARTIST THING THAT YOU'RE DOING, THAT'S VERY CUTE, BUT THERE'S $100,000 AT STAKE. YOU HAVE TO BUCK UP AND BE A WARRIOR. - ALL OF YOU ARE HONORING EACH OTHER BY BRINGING YOUR "A" GAME. - PREACH. - BECAUSE YOU'RE HONORING EACH OTHER'S TALENT. - THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. HONOR TO YOURSELF AND TO YOUR ART AND TO YOUR TALENT. DO THAT! AND, GEAR, YOU KNOW THAT. AND, LADY SCORPIO OVER HERE, YOU KNOW IT, TOO. SO DON'T BE ACTIN' UP IN HERE, OKAY? NOW, I CAN--I CAN SIT BACK HERE AND--AND PLAY ALONG... - [laughs] - WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND EVERYBODY BACK HOME WILL SAY, "OH, THEY WERE SO SWEET AND SO LOVELY." BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THOSE PEOPLE DON'T WIN COMPETITIONS. PLAY THE GAME! DO YOUR THING! BE WHO YOU ARE! THAT'S HONOR. - WHY DID YOU GUYS SHOW UP HERE IF YOU WEREN'T WILLING TO GO FOR BLOOD? YOU FEEL EMBARRASSED ABOUT MAKING THE CHOICE TO BE A WINNER? A CONQUEROR? GEAR, I CAN FEEL YOU BUBBLING UNDER. I'VE PRIMED YOU. YOU'RE READY TO TALK. TALK TO ME. - [sighs] I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM, AND I UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE HERE. - YEAH. - WE'RE NOT HERE TO WASTE YOUR TIME OR MINE. SO DO WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE TO DO AND MAKE A DECISION. I GET IT. I GET IT, RU. - OH, I GET IT, TOO. I REALLY DO. I LIKE THE CHANGES I MADE TO MY PIECE. IT GOT MORE REAL FOR ME. I TAPPED INTO THAT DARK SCORPIO SIDE. IT'S FREAKIN' INTENSE. I PUNCHED A HOLE IN MY MODEL'S CHEST BECAUSE OF THAT INTENSITY. I GET IT. - DO YOU WANNA BE HERE? - YEAH! I WANNA BE HERE SO BAD. I'M HERE TO WIN. THAT $100,000 WOULD CHANGE MY FREAKIN' LIFE. - GEAR, DO YOU WANNA BE HERE? - ABSOLUTELY. - [sighs] - WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT, I WONDER. - WELL, WHO ARE YOU GONNA CHOOSE NOW? - NATALIE DID MORE THAN GEAR, BUT THE THING IS, LIKE, WHICH ONE LOOKS BETTER? [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - SO, JUDGES, ARE YOU ALL IN AGREEMENT? - YES. NATALIE. WE FELT THAT WITH THE EXTRA 30 MINUTES, YOU ELEVATED YOUR PIECE, USING YOUR EMOTIONS AND EXPRESSING WHAT YOU WERE FEELING. - THANK YOU. - GEAR. YOU DIDN'T USE THE EXTRA 30 MINUTES TO ENHANCE YOUR PAINTING, AND YOU LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET THE BEST OF YOU. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ AND FOR THAT REASON... WE WILL SAY GOOD-BYE. - IT'S OKAY. - [crying] - GO GET 'EM, TIGER. KICK SOME ASS. - WHOA. THAT'S SUPER INTENSE. - CONGRATULATIONS, NATALIE. - THANK YOU. - YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - I AM SO GRATEFUL THAT I HAVE A SECOND CHANCE, BUT... [sniffles] IT'S STILL SAD. - WHAT IS THAT? COME ON. - [crying] - IT'S OKAY. - WHAT THE [bleep]? - I KNOW, HONEY. - GEAR, YOUR ARTISTIC ABILITY HAS ELEVATED EVERYONE AROUND YOU. - I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT ELSE LIES IN STORE FOR YOU. - YOU'VE GOT IT, KIDDO. - [imitates guitar riff] - THIS IS NOT THE END. THIS IS THE BEGINNING. - ABSOLUTELY. YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING, AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL. - GEAR, PLEASE GO WASH OFF YOUR CANVAS. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - TONIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN ANYBODY'S BALL GAME. I WISH I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY AND PLAY A LITTLE LONGER. [upbeat music] I WOULD RATHER HAVE SEEN MYSELF GO THAN ANY OF THEM GO, 'CAUSE I JUST COULDN'T TAKE THAT PAIN. I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT ANY DIFFERENT. [upbeat music] I ABSOLUTELY DID EVERYTHING I MEANT TO DO. AND WISH--DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN OUT HERE AT SKIN WARS. IT DOESN'T END HERE. IT ONLY GOES UP FROM HERE. - NEXT TIME ON SKIN WARS... NATALIE, SOMETHING'S GOT YOU EXTRA EXCITED TODAY? - [sighs] both: [gasp] - THEY'RE GIVING US CONTORTIONISTS. I'M GONNA USE CONTORTIONISTS. - HOW LONG CAN YOUR MODELS STAY IN THIS POSE? - 30 MINUTES LEFT. - I REALLY HAVE TO KNOCK IT OUT OF THE PARK TODAY. 15 MINUTES LEFT! - I AM GOING SUPER WEIRD WITH MY CONCEPT. - I DID NOT GET THIS AT ALL. - THIS COULD BE REALLY BAD. - I HATE THE FACT THAT YOU BROUGHT IN THAT ELEMENT. - TONIGHT, FOUR BECOMES THREE.
