I THINK THAT WE COULD REALLY BALANCE EACH OTHER OUT. - FELLE. - SHANNON. - I'M SUPER HAPPY TO BE WITH FELLE BECAUSE HE HAS SO MUCH SKILL, AND I'M JUST EXCITED TO LEARN FROM HIM. - THAT MEANS, NATALIE AND ANGELA, YOU ARE A TEAM TOGETHER. - IT FEELS LIKE KICKBALL AGAIN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. - THAT'S ALL GOOD.

I THINK I'M GONNA PUT MY FISH ON--ON FIRE. - WELL, THEN YOUR WATER WOULD BE BLUE. - NO. - WELL, NO, YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

WE HAVE A LOT OF METICULOUS DETAIL AND A LOT OF SOFT COLORS VERSUS HARD COLORS, AND THEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A STORY THAT--THAT--THAT METAPHORICALLY SUGGESTS YIN AND YANG. - HEY, GUYS. - HELLO. - HI. - WOW. - OH! NICE SURPRISE. OKAY. - FOR THE YIN AND YANG, WE DECIDED TO TAKE, LIKE, AN EMOTIONAL STANCE ON THAT. - SO WE HAVE OUR TEARS OF SORROW AND OUR TEARS OF JOY. - YES, EXACTLY. - I LOVE THAT REVEAL.

THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - OKAY, SO WHO DID WHICH PARTS? - I DID THE--THE TOP PART WITH THE ANGELS AND-- - WE WANTED TO CATER TO BOTH OF OUR PAINTING STRENGTHS. AND SO I WANTED TO DO SORT OF VISCERAL AND HARD. BUT IN THE MIDDLE, WE WANTED TO TELL A STORY ABOUT THE BALANCE AND THE HARMONY. - THERE'S A LOVE STORY. - OH, THERE'S A LOVE STORY. SO, MYTHICA, IT WAS YOUR IDEA TO HAVE A LOVE STORY? - YES. I LOVE DUTCH. - OH. THANKS, GUYS. both: THANK YOU. - I GOT TO SAY, I'M VERY IMPRESSED THAT MYTHICA EXECUTED AS WELL AS SHE DID ON THIS PIECE. - IT HAS A GREAT STAGE PRESENCE, YOU KNOW? - WE USED SOME PROPS TODAY TO REALLY EXPRESS BOTH OF THOSE SIDES. - I THINK YOUR USE OF PROPS WAS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. - OBVIOUSLY, THE RESULT IS VERY DIFFERENT, BUT DID YOU NOTICE YOUR THEME IS SIMILAR TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S? - I ONLY NOTICED WHENEVER THEY WERE FINISHED. AND THEN I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - THANK YOU. - SO, GUYS, WHAT DO WE THINK? - DUTCH AND MYTHICA'S PIECE-- I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT CUTTING OFF AT THE WAIST. ALSO, THE WHOLE FACE, THERE WAS NOT MUCH GOING ON THERE, AND THEN THEY TRIED TO COVER THE FACE WITH A VEIL. - [laughs] LET'S JUST HIDE IT. - NOT MY FAVORITE. YEAH. - I LOVED FELLE AND SHANNON. - WHAT A GREAT MIX BETWEEN THE TWO... - I KNOW. - LIKE, LITERALLY YIN-YANG. - AND THEY REALLY TOOK IT ALL THE WAY, LITERALLY, TO THE TIP OF THE TOES. - [laughs] I LOVE THE TOES. - I HAVE TO GIVE GEAR AND NICOLE PROPS FOR THE THEATRICALITY THAT THEY ACHIEVED. I MEAN, I THOUGHT THAT THE PROPS WERE JUST PERFECT. - NOW, CREATIVELY SPEAKING, NATALIE AND ANGELA BROUGHT A LOT TO THE TABLE. LOVED THE HANDS. - YEAH. - THAT WAS A NICE SURPRISE. - SUCH A NICE, LITTLE SURPRISE. - YOU LIKE THEM BETTER THAN GEAR AND NICOLE? - [sighs] - I KNOW. - CREATIVELY? ABSOLUTELY. - BUT TECHNICALLY. - TECHNICALLY AT THE BOTTOM, BUT CREATIVELY AT THE TOP. SO WHAT DO YOU DO? - YEAH, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE. - I'M LOOKING AT MY PIECE, AND I'M THINKING, THIS WAS NOT THE VISION THAT I HAD IN MIND. BUT I'M ONLY 50% IN CONTROL OF THIS ARTWORK AND, YOU KNOW, IT IS WHAT IT IS, AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY. - ANGELA AND MINE IS SUPER CREATIVE.

WE CAN FIGURE IT OUT. - I THINK WE SHOULD DO THE '50s. THAT'S MY PERSONAL CHOICE. IF YOU WANT TO DO THE '70s... - I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE '50s. - FELLE, SHANNON, WHAT DECADE IS IT GONNA BE? - WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? THE '50s. - '50s. - I CAN DO, YOU KNOW, PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING.

[laughter] - NICOLE AND GEAR. - YEAH. both: '20s. - '20s. - I'VE JUST RECENTLY SEEN MOVIES THAT ARE OF A '20s ERA. SO I'M THINKING, "HEY, I'M NOT COMPLETELY OUT OF THE WATER ON THIS ONE." - MYTHICA AND DUTCH. - WHAT DO YOU THINK? I'M AN '80s KID. - I LOVE THE '80s. both: '80s. - '80s. - YOU'VE GOT THE NEON TO PROVE IT. - LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. OKAY. - WE GET LAST AGAIN-- LAST CHOICE. - ALL RIGHT, LAST BUT NOT LEAST.

YES. - [laughs] WE'LL MAKE THE MOST OF IT. - BEFORE I LET YOU GO, THERE'S ONE MORE LITTLE THING I NEED TO TELL YOU. IN THE LAST CHALLENGE, YOU WORKED AS TEAMS. IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOUR TEAMMATE BECOMES YOUR COMPETITOR. - DAMN! - OH. - OH, [bleep]. - I'M SO SORRY, SWEETIE. - OH, MY GOD. - ARE YOU SERIOUS? I HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT THE '50s, AND I'M RELYING ON HER TO HELP ME OUT. AND NOW SHE'S MY COMPETITION. - YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HARDER, BUDDY. - TOO BAD, SO SAD, FELLE. - [chuckles] - YOU WILL GO HEAD-TO-HEAD PAINTING THE SAME DECADE ON YOUR RESPECTIVE MODELS. ONE OF YOU ON EACH TEAM WILL RISE TO THE TOP. THE OTHER WILL BE AT RISK FOR ELIMINATION. - [whistles] - BRUTAL. - HERE ARE YOUR MODELS. HELLO, LADIES. - HELLO. - HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON? - HI. - WAIT, THERE ARE ONLY FOUR MODELS. - MAYBE WE HAVE TO SPLIT IT IN HALF. I'M THINKING, HOW HARD IS THAT GOING TO BE TO COMPETE IN THE SAME SPACE AGAIN? - SINCE YOUR WORK WILL BE COMPARED, IT'S ONLY FAIR THAT YOU ALL HAVE THE SAME CANVAS. - WHAT? - WHAT? - OH, MY GOD! - OH, THEY'RE TWINS! THE MODELS ARE TWINS. THEY LOOK JUST ALIKE. COOL. WELL, DUH. THEY'RE TWINS. - COOL. - YOU'RE NOT SEEING DOUBLE. YOUR MODELS ARE TWINS. - YAY! - THAT'S GONNA BE COOL. - YOU KNOW, ME AND SHANNON, WE JUST WON THE CHALLENGE TOGETHER, BUT MY EYES ARE ON THE PRIZE. I NEED TO BEAT SHANNON. - AND WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW. - OH. [applause] - ARE YOU GUYS GONNA MAKE PROPS? I'D LIKE TO BRING A TRAY WITH SOME COOKIES. - MAKE A TRAY. - HOW WOULD YOU MAKE YOUR TRAY? - JUST THE-- - SO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA JUST TELL MY COMPETITION HOW TO DO THIS STUFF? YOU MIGHT AS WELL LET THEM DO THE PAINT. - OH, HOGWASH. WE ARE TOSSING IDEAS BACK AND FORTH, AND I'M SAYING, "OH, I COULD DO, LIKE, THE 1950'S HOUSEWIFE WITH, LIKE, THE TRAY OF COOKIES." SO I ASKED NICOLE, "HOW WOULD YOU MAKE A COOKIE TRAY?" - IF I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING AND I ASK SOMEBODY, THAT'S UNFAIR. - THAT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP, TOO. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - AND THEN FELLE BUTTS IN THAT IF I WANT TO ASK NICOLE HOW TO MAKE MY COOKIE TRAY, WHY DON'T I JUST HAVE HER PAINT MY WHOLE PIECE FOR ME, 'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF THE SAME THING. - IF YOUR CREATIVE MIND TELLS YOU THAT YOU NEED TO BAKE SOME COOKIES WITH A PAN INSTEAD OF MAKE A SQUARE PIECE OF CARDBOARD... - OKAY, FELLE, I'VE HAD ENOUGH. - YOU LEAVE THE CONTEST. - EXCUSE ME. THANKS. - DON'T LET YOUR EMOTIONS GET YOU SENT HOME. THIS COMPETITION IS ABOUT BEING CREATIVE. HOW HARD IS IT TO CREATE A PAN AND SOME COOKIES? SO I'M THINKING, WHY THE HELL IS SHE HERE? [laughs] - [chuckles] [upbeat music] - FOR THE APPAREL CHALLENGE, I'M DOING A VINTAGE CIRCUS COSTUME. I'M DOING A LOT OF LITTLE DETAILS, A LOT OF BEADWORK, BUT THE BIGGEST RISK THAT I'M TAKING WITH THIS PIECE IS NOT COVERING THE ENTIRE MODEL. - ALL RIGHT. - FOCUS, DANIEL-SAN. THE '80s WAS ABOUT ALL THE CRAZY OUTFITS WITH ALL THE TIGHT SPANDEX PANTS AND THE CRAZY GLASSES, AND WHAT'S GOING THROUGH MY HEAD IS THAT I'M UP AGAINST MY TEACHER. MY SECRET WEAPON IN TODAY'S CHALLENGE IS MY TIME CHART. I'M GONNA TAKE 30 MINUTES ON THIS. I'M GONNA TAKE 15 MINUTES ON THAT. - HELLO, HELLO. GOOD MORNING. - HEY. - HEY, LOVE. HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? - FINE. ALL RIGHT. - PRETTY RHINESTONES. - I KNOW, RIGHT? THEY KIND OF, LIKE, REMIND ME OF DISCO BALLS. - OOH, I LIKE 'EM. - MY CONCEPT IS '70s DISCO. I DECIDED TO THROW IN SOME WORDS IN THERE TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT I CAN SPELL. IF I HAVE ENOUGH PREP TIME, I CAN GET THESE THINGS RIGHT. OH, BOY. - YEAH, DUDE! - I WANT TO TALK THIS OUT WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A BIT OF COOPERATION ON YOUR PART. - OKAY. - YOU'RE, LIKE, A FRESH KILL ZOMBIE SO-- YOU'RE NOT-- I MEAN, YOU'RE PRETTY HIDEOUS. I WASN'T SURE ABOUT MY IDEA FOR THE HAPPY HOUSEWIFE. SO I'M GONNA DO THIS GREAT '50s ZOMBIE PINUP GIRL PIECE. THAT'S MY THEME, AND THAT, FOR SURE, IS GONNA BE A CROWD-PLEASER. SLIGHTLY BEND AT THE WAIST FORWARD. - OKAY. - THERE YOU GO. - WELL, WELL, WELL. - HI, BODY PAINTERS. - WELL, WELL, WELL. - OH, MY GOSH, HELLO. - HELLO. - YOU ALL KNOW THE ESTEEMED RU.

I'M CONSIDERING CHANGING THE WHOLE ENTIRE THING. - IF YOU WANT TO AVOID FACING ELIMINATION, YOU BETTER ROCK YOUR DECADE. - THIS IS A TOTAL DISASTER. - OH, MY GOD! - HI, EVERYBODY.

IT REALLY DOES CAPTURE THE DISCO ERA SO WELL. - THANK YOU. - I THINK YOU PROBABLY CREATED ALL OF IT WHEN SHE DIDN'T HAVE HER SHOES ON, AND THEN YOU POPPED THE SHOES ON, YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, MY PANTS ARE TOO SHORT" - YEAH. - THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT'S THROWING ME OFF A LITTLE BIT, BUT OVERALL, FANTASTIC. - THANK YOU. THANK YOU. - THANK YOU, MODELS. THANK YOU, ANGELA AND NATALIE. SHANNON AND FELLE. - SO, FELLE, YOUR MODEL IS-- LIKE, THE FIRST THING THAT JUMPS OUT TO ME IS, LIKE, I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S NOT WEARING PANTS, BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH A GREAT RENDERING OF AN AMAZING PAIR OF DENIM. THE ONLY CALLOUT ON THE JACKET, I THINK I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN SOME KIND OF DETAILING THAT LOOKED LIKE THE WRINKLING OF LEATHER. AND NOTHING ENCAPSULATES THE SEXUAL INNOCENCE OF THE '50s LIKE A POODLE HUMPING YOUR LEG-- I LOVED IT. [laughter] IT WAS FANTASTIC. - I WAS SURPRISED, THOUGH, THAT THERE WASN'T A MEGAPHONE OR SOMETHING ON THE BACK, THAT IT WAS BLANK. - RIGHT. - SHANNON, YOU WERE VERY AMBITIOUS. I FEEL LIKE YOU GAVE YOURSELF A CLOTHING AND A GORE CHALLENGE. YOU WERE REALLY CLEVER WITH THE APPAREL YOU CHOSE. BUT, CARSON, IS THIS REALLY '50s? - I THINK '40s I THINK, YOU KNOW, LIKE ROSIE THE RIVETER, AND LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT SHE'S WEARING DURING THE DAY BEFORE SHE GOES TO THE FACTORY AT NIGHT. - RIGHT. - THANK YOU, SHANNON AND FELLE. both: THANK YOU. - DUTCH AND MYTHICA. - MYTHICA, YOU REALLY EPITOMIZED THE '80s POP CULTURE. YOU WERE MY BIGGEST SURPRISE OF THIS CHALLENGE. YOU USED ALL OF YOUR SKILLS. - MYTHICA, THIS IS REALLY SMOKIN'. IT'S NOT PERFECT, BUT I KNOW THIS GIRL. SHE IS A SUPER FREAK. - THANK YOU SO MUCH, RU. THANK YOU. - DUTCH, I THINK I HAD THAT TOP IN THE '80s. THE RUNS IN THE NYLONS ARE SUCH A CLEVER, FUN IDEA. I WISH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HIT THE BOTTOM WITH JUST A LITTLE SHADOW SO YOU REALLY COULD SELL THAT ILLUSION. - HER MAKEUP IS FANTASTIC, TOO. I NOTICED, LIKE, THE EYE MAKEUP THING IS FEROCIOUS. AND LET ME TALK ABOUT YOUR ARMS. IT'S LIKE LOOKING IN A MIRROR. I MEAN, IT IS REALLY UNCANNY. THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. - THANK YOU, MYTHICA. THANK YOU, DUTCH. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - NICOLE AND GEAR, COME ON UP. - NICOLE, THIS IS FUN. LOOKS GREAT ON THE MODEL. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - I THINK IT'S SO CUTE. IT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF BLING. IT WAS A LITTLE RISKY TO LEAVE SO MUCH SKIN UNPAINTED. - THE TEXTURE OF THE BRA PIECE ON THE TOP, IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SEE FROM HERE. THE SAME ON THE BOY SHORT. - GEAR, YOUR OUTFIT IS ALSO VERY LOVELY. LISTEN, I'M ALWAYS A SUCKER FOR A PEARL NECKLACE. [laughter] - I MEAN, WHO ISN'T? - YOU KNOW? - THANK YOU. - YOU ARE SUCH A SKILLED TECHNICAL PAINTER, AND I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A COUPLE PLACES WHERE MAYBE WE FOUND A LITTLE CHINK IN THE ARMOR-- LACE. WHILE THE GLOVES ARE BEAUTIFUL, IT KIND OF FELL FLAT ON THE LEGS. - THIS IS MY FIRST TIME DOING CLOTHING EVER. - YEAH, YOU WERE A BIT OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT. - THANK YOU, GEAR. THANK YOU, NICOLE. PAINTERS, YOU'VE DEFINITELY GIVEN THE JUDGES A LOT TO DISCUSS. - I'M FEELING INSECURE BECAUSE I PUT MY CREATIVITY INTO A ZOMBIE INSTEAD OF CLOTHING. I KNOW THAT I HAVE TO BEAT FELLE. I CANNOT GO HOME. - OKAY, GUYS, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE. - WHAT DID YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT MYTHICA? - I WAS SHOCKED. THAT ZEBRA ON THE BACK OF HER IS-- I THOUGHT WAS GREAT. - RIGHT. - AND IT PULLED THE WHOLE LOOK TOGETHER. - AND THE SHAPE OF IT AND THE THREE-DIMENSIONALITY OF IT. - YES. BUT WHEN YOU REALLY LOOKED CLOSE AT THOSE ZEBRA STRIPES... - MM-HMM. - THEY WEREN'T CLEAN AND PERFECTLY PAINTED. - RIGHT. - BUT THE OVERALL EFFECT... - YEAH. - WAS JUST BEAUTIFUL. - MM-HMM. - BUT YOU KNOW, DUTCH IS A FANTASTIC PAINTER. HONESTLY, HE'S FANTASTIC. THE COLORS-- - IT WAS LIKE IT WAS ELECTRIC. - IT WAS ELECTRIC. IT MADE ME HAPPY. - BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I FELT THAT HE OVEREXAGGERATED HIS FOLDS A BIT. - YEAH. - WITH DUTCH AND MYTHICA SIDE BY SIDE, IT FELT LIKE THEY WERE PAINTED BY THE SAME PERSON. - MM-HMM. - AND IT WAS THOSE LITTLE THINGS THAT PUT ONE OVER THE EDGE. - YES. - WHAT ABOUT FELLE AND SHANNON? - THAT'S TOUGH. - I THINK SHANNON'S WAS OVERKILL. THE THING WAS, IT WAS A FASHION CHALLENGE. AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, SHE'S A ZOMBIE. SHE'S '50s, BUT SHE LOOKED KIND OF '40s." - BUT YOU KNOW, I ADMIRE HER THAT SHE JUST, LIKE, WENT FOR IT ANYWAY. MAN, HEAD TO TOE, THAT WAS A LOT OF WORK. - HER MODEL WAS SO COMMITTED. SHE WAS, LIKE, LIMPING AND CHEWING HER ARM OFF. - I LOVED IT. I APPRECIATE HER AMBITION, BUT I THINK THE CHALLENGE CALLED FOR THE KIND OF LITERAL INTERPRETATION THAT FELLE GAVE. BUT THE LETTERMAN JACKET-- I WAS SURPRISED THAT IT WAS BLANK ON THE BACK. - FELLE'S WAS LITERALLY LIKE A PAGE OUT OF THE HAPPY DAYS PLAYBOOK, WHERE IT WAS, LIKE, THE LETTERMAN JACKET, THE JEANS. IT WAS WELL DONE. ONE WENT TO BE CREATIVE, ONE STAYED LITERAL. - I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK HE LIKED MY PIECE. SO, [groans]. - WHAT ABOUT GEAR AND NICOLE? - GEAR--THE SILHOUETTE WAS NICE. HE HAD THE ACCESSORIES, THE HEADBAND. - IT WAS WELL DONE. FROM A TECHNICAL SIDE, AS SOON AS I SAW THAT BLACK, I SAID, "HE PLAYED IT SAFE." - FROM THE WAIST UP, IT WORKS. - YEAH. - BUT FROM THE WAIST DOWN-- - THE LINES WEREN'T CRISP. THE FAKE LACE HOSIERY JUST LOOKED LIKE SHE HAD BRUISES. IT WAS LIKE, I COULD DO THAT. - YEAH. AND YOU KNOW, NICOLE'S PIECE REALLY EXPRESSED THE OPTIMISM OF THE '20s. - IT HAD GLITZ AND GLAM... - RIGHT. - AND A STYLE THAT WAS ELEGANT. - THE JEWELS DOWN THE BACK. - YEAH. - RIGHT. IT REALLY--THAT-- TO ME, THAT REALLY SPARKLED. - BUT SHE DIDN'T PAINT THE WHOLE BODY. - RIGHT. - RIGHT. - I CANNOT IMAGINE WHO WOULD GO HOME TONIGHT FROM ANY OF THOSE PIECES. - NO, NO. - 'CAUSE THEY ALL FREAKING ROCK. - AND, GUYS, WHAT ABOUT NATALIE AND ANGELA? - NATALIE--IT WASN'T DEAD-ON, LIKE, SOLID GOLD, BUT IT WAS STILL VERY ICONIC '70s - I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THAT GIRL-- THOSE SKATES, THE HEADPHONES. - SO MANY LITTLE THINGS TO LOOK AT. - IT WAS LIKE A SCHOOLHOUSE ROCK! CARTOON... - YES. - CAME TO LIFE. - YES, I REMEMBER THAT. - YOU SEE, LIKE, RAINBOWS AND STARS SHOOTING OUT OF HER ASS. LIKE, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE. ANGELA'S WAS SOLID GOLD DANCER. - SHE PLAYED IT MORE OBVIOUS. - YEAH, WHICH I KIND OF LIKED. - I LOVED THE TOP. - SO COLORFUL. - I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT THE TEXT, BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY WANT TO READ "DISCO"... - IT'S OBVIOUS. - ON THE BACK. I WANT YOU TO SHOW ME DISCO. - THEY'RE ALL REALLY, REALLY GREAT PAINTERS. YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY ANYBODY'S GAME. - ALL RIGHT, HAVE YOU MADE YOUR DECISION? - I THINK SO. - ABSOLUTELY. - YEAH. - YES. - PAINTERS, YOU ALL DID A FANTASTIC JOB. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - NICOLE, NATALIE, PLEASE STEP FORWARD. FELLE, MYTHICA, PLEASE JOIN THEM. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE THE TOP FOUR. - WHOO! - [giggles] - [laughs] - OH, MY GOODNESS. - [cackles] OKAY, SORRY. THE SNOWBALL'S CHANCE IN HELL HAPPENED. - NICOLE, THE JUDGES LOVED THAT YOU CHOSE TO TELL A STORY WITH YOUR OUTFIT, AND YOUR ATTENTION TO DETAIL REALLY BROUGHT THE LOOK TOGETHER. NATALIE, YOUR LOOK TRANSPORTED THE JUDGES TO THE '70s. YOUR THUMB DETAIL AND THE DENIM SHADING WAS IMPECCABLE. - AWESOME. - FELLE, FOR SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO DO THE '50s... - [chuckles] - YOU DEFINITELY MADE THE MOST OF IT. - I LOVE MY POODLE. - YOUR POODLE LOVED YOUR MODEL. - [laughs] - MYTHICA, THE '80s WERE ALL ABOUT NEON, SPANDEX, AND DENIM, AND YOU INCORPORATED ALL THREE SEAMLESSLY. - THANK YOU. - SO WHO STOOD OUT ABOVE THE REST? THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... NATALIE. - OH! - YAY! - NONE OF THE OTHER CONTESTANTS REALLY KNEW WHO I WAS, AND SO I THINK THAT THEY DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT ME, BUT I HAVE SO MUCH PASSION FOR THIS ART FORM. AND IF YOU ADD MY PASSION FOR THIS, PLUS $100,000, YOU KNOW, LIKE, I'M UNSTOPPABLE. - CONGRATULATIONS, NATALIE. - WHOO! - THANK YOU SO MUCH. - YOU MAY HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - THANK YOU. - SHANNON, ANGELA, GEAR, DUTCH, UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT. - I THINK THAT THE JUDGES ARE TRYING TO RATTLE MY CAGE A LITTLE BIT, BUT I'LL BE PERFECTLY FRANK, I THINK SHANNON'S GOING HOME. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - SHANNON, ANGELA, GEAR, DUTCH, UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT. SHANNON, THE JUDGES LOVED YOUR CREATIVITY. BUT THEY FEEL YOU BIT OFF MORE THAN YOU COULD CHEW, AND YOUR CONCEPT GOT MUDDIED. DUTCH, TECHNIQUE ALONE WILL NOT KEEP YOU IN THIS COMPETITION. THE '80s WERE AN OUTRAGEOUS DECADE, AND YOUR LOOK JUST DIDN'T TAKE IT FAR ENOUGH. ANGELA, YOUR LOOK WAS FUN AND THE COLOR PALETTE WAS ON POINT, BUT THE JUDGES FELT YOUR CONCEPT WAS TOO LITERAL. THEY WISH YOU'D LET YOUR PAINTING SAY "DISCO" WITHOUT SPELLING IT OUT. GEAR, THE 1920S WERE WILD AND REBELLIOUS, AND THE JUDGES FEEL LIKE YOUR LOOK WAS ANYTHING BUT. GEAR, ANGELA. I'M SORRY. ONE OF YOU IS GOING HOME. SHANNON, DUTCH, THAT MEANS YOU ARE SAFE. YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - I'M JUST GONNA PUSH HARDER. I KNOW I CAN DO BETTER. I'VE GOT TO REALLY BRING IT. - THANK YOU. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ - [sighs] - GEAR, ANGELA, IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS... - I'M PRETTY SHOCKED. I'M THINKING THAT I ACTUALLY MIGHT GO HOME. - ANGELA... YOUR JOURNEY ENDS HERE. - OKAY. OKAY. IT'S OKAY. - HEY. I'M SORRY. - NO, IT'S ALL GOOD. YOU KNOW, IT IS A COMPLETE HONOR TO BE HERE. YOU KNOW, I HAD SO MANY PEOPLE TALK DOWN ON ME AND TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NEVER MAKE IT. SO I AM SO HONORED. I REALLY AM. AND BRING IT. [laughs] - [laughs] - AND, YOU KNOW, ANGELA, THE JOURNEY CONTINUES WITH ALL OF OUR LOVE AND SUPPORT BEHIND YOU. - THE GIRL'S GOT MAD SKILLS. [both laugh] - ANGELA... IT'S TIME TO WASH OFF YOUR CANVAS. - OKAY. BYE, EVERYBODY. - GOOD LUCK. - BYE-BYE. - GEAR, NO MORE PLAYING IT SAFE. IF YOU WANT TO STAY AROUND, YOU REALLY NEED TO STEP IT UP. YOU CAN HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - THANK YOU. - AS I LEAVE SKIN WARS, I'M WALKING AWAY WITH CONFIDENCE... AND WALKING AWAY WITH NEW FRIENDS. I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE THE AIRBRUSH ANYMORE. I'M JUST A WHOLE NEW PERSON. I HAVE A BODY-PAINTING CAREER AHEAD OF ME, SO YOU'RE GONNA SEE ME AGAIN. [chuckles] - NEXT TIME ON SKIN WARS... I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR GUEST JUDGE-- WONDER WOMAN HERSELF, LYNDA CARTER. - YAY! - MWAH! - HELLO, DUTCH. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. - GOD. - IT FEELS A LITTLE CHEESY. - THAT'S IT. I'VE HAD IT. I'M ANGRY. - HERE'S COMES THE MYTHICA SHOW. - AAH! - WHOA. - [crying]
