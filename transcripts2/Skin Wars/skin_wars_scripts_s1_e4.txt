[upbeat music] - OH. - GOING INTO TODAY, THERE'S ONLY SEVEN OF US LEFT, AND EVERYONE'S JUST KIND OF LIKE, LOOKING AROUND, LIKE, THIS IS COMPETITION NOW.

 - HI, ROBIN. - WHOO-HOO. - AND RU. - [laughs] HELLO. - AS YOU CAN SEE, THE ROOM LOOKS A LITTLE DIFFERENT TODAY. - YES. YES, IT DOES. WE ALL HAVE, LIKE, A LIT-UP VANITY MIRROR SITTING AT OUR STATIONS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS GONNA BE TODAY. - THE PAST FEW CHALLENGES HAVE REALLY PUSHED YOU OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONES. BUT TODAY, WE'RE TAKING THINGS TO THE NEXT LEVEL. THE FIRST CHALLENGE IS GOING TO FORCE YOU TO FACE YOUR FEARS. LITERALLY. THE BEST WAY TO OVERCOME YOUR FEARS IS TO FACE THEM HEAD-ON. THAT'S WHY, FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL BE PAINTING YOUR BIGGEST FEAR ON YOUR OWN FACE. - BOO. - [laughs] - [laughs] - HEE HEE. YES, YES, YES. THIS IS GONNA BE SO COOL. [laughs] - I'M LIKE, "DAMN IT," I'VE NEVER HAD TO FACE-PAINT MYSELF. THIS IS ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE FIRST-TIME THINGS. - PAINTERS, THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE WILL GET A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR THE UPCOMING CONCEPT CHALLENGE. YOU HAVE TWO HOURS TO PAINT YOUR FACE AND NECK TO COMPLETE THIS CHALLENGE. YOUR TIME STARTS... NOW. - ALL RIGHT, DON'T BE SCARED. - GOOD LUCK. [upbeat rock music] - I REALLY CAN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING THAT I'M REALLY AFRAID OF. WHAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE MAJORITY COULD RELATE TO? AND I'M THINKING HORROR FILMS. AND I NEED A CLEAN SURFACE. YOU KNOW, I NEED TO GET RID OF THIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE AND HAIR. - YOU'RE SHAVING YOUR HEAD? - THIS IS FOR $100,000. - I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE PAINTING A REPRESENTATION OF AN EVIL BEING FROM MY NIGHTMARES AS A KID. - I'M AFRAID OF LOSING MY HUMANITY AND BECOMING A MONSTER. EACH OF THE PIECES THAT I PUT ON MY FACE REPRESENTS SOMETHING THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON WITH ME. - I'M A FATHER, AND SO I FEAR FOR THE SAFETY OF MY CHILDREN, BUT THE ONLY THING THAT TRULY TERRIFIES ME IS SPIDERS. ONE HOUR, FOLKS. ONE HOUR. GET IT ON! - MY BOYFRIEND IS AN OUTDOOR GUIDE. HE HAS A DANGEROUS PROFESSION. MY FEAR IS IF HE'S OUT ON THE MOUNTAIN AND HE GETS STUCK. THAT'S WHY I DECIDE THAT I'M GONNA PAINT MYSELF AS MY LOVED ONE, BUT DEAD. - MY BIGGEST FEAR IS TURNING INTO AN OLD LADY, GETTING WRINKLY, AND NOT BEING FLEXIBLE ANYMORE. - BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS TRYING TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR WITH MY HAND, WHICH IS BLOCKING MY VISION FROM THE MIRROR. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS PAINTING ON SOMEONE ELSE'S FACE. - I CAN HANDLE RATS, CATS, SNAKES, BUT IF I THINK THERE'S A SPIDER ON ME, IT'LL JUST MAKE ME SQUEAL LIKE A LITTLE GIRL. - WOW, DUTCH IS AFRAID OF SPIDERS. THIS, LIKE, BIG DUDE FEELS THE SAME WAY THAT I DO. I GO OUT ON A LOT OF INTERNET DATES. MY MOM ALWAYS SAYS, "PLEASE BE CAREFUL. DON'T COME HOME IN A BODY BAG." MY PIECE IS ABOUT A WORST-CASE SCENARIO. I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED AND LEFT FOR DEAD IN A FOREST. - NOT TRYING TO SCARE EVERYBODY, BUT WE HAVE 30 MORE MINUTES. - THE ONE THING THAT I KNOW THAT I CAN DO THAT NOBODY ELSE CAN DO IS PAINT THE BACK OF MY HEAD. - MYTHICA'S PROSTHETIC IS NOT PAINTED VERY WELL. SHE'S PAINTED HER PROSTHETIC ON THE BACK OF HER HEAD, INSTEAD OF PAINTING IT ON THE TABLE IN FRONT OF HER AND THEN APPLYING IT TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD. [laughs] - AAH! - I MAKE A CONSCIOUS CHOICE NOT TO DO ANYTHING WITH MY NECK. I DON'T THINK THAT ADDING ANYTHING HERE IS GOING TO ENHANCE WHAT I'VE DONE HERE. - OH, MY GOD, 36 SECONDS! - I'VE NEVER LOOKED BETTER. - I SACRIFICED MY BEARD, YOU KNOW, MY--MY MUSTACHE, MY HAIR. I BETTER WIN THIS ONE. - OKAY, PAINTERS, YOUR TIME IS UP. PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. WOW! - ARTISTS HAS ISSUES. [laughter] - HELLO. I'M SEEING SO MANY MOVIE ICONS-- FREDDY, PINHEAD, AND THAT--THERE'S THE JOKER. YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF SCARY MOVIES. - I AM ENTERTAINED BY HORROR MOVIES. - HE JUST TOOK IT VERY LITERALLY. WHAT ARE PEOPLE AFRAID OF? PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF HORROR MOVIES. IT WAS AN EASY WAY OUT. - WOW. - MY BIGGEST FEAR IS LOSING MY HUMANITY IN THIS COMPETITION. I TOOK TIME TO MONSTERIZE MY BLIND SPOT BASICALLY. - AND, SIR, WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST FEAR? - [laughs] - THE BIGGEST FEARS COME FROM THE INSIDE OUT. THE CALLS ARE COMING FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE. - SO TELL US ABOUT YOUR FEAR. - I AM AN ARACHNOPHOBE. - DID YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE NEVER MORE THAN 6 FEET AWAY FROM A SPIDER? - [screams] THAT'S AWESOME. THANKS. - HOW DO YOU FEEL RIGHT NOW? - I'M LOVING THE FOUR PAIRS OF EYES. - THANK YOU. - THIS CHALLENGE WAS FROM THE NECK UP. - MM-HMM. - WAS IT A CHOICE TO LEAVE YOUR NECK EMPTY? - YEAH. I REALLY COULDN'T COME UP WITH ANYTHING ELSE THAT REALLY SAID "SPIDER," BELOW THE CHIN. - THANK YOU, DUTCH. - THANK YOU. - HEY, NICOLE. - WOW. THIS CHALLENGE WENT LONGER THAN I THOUGHT. - I KNOW. MY BIGGEST FEAR IS GETTING OLD. AND WHEN I'M OLD, I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. all: OOH! - WOW, GRANNY'S GOT A GIMMICK. - YOU DID A REALLY BEAUTIFUL JOB BLENDING THOSE PROSTHETICS. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU, NICOLE. - THANK YOU, GUYS, SO MUCH. - I DATE VIA THE INTERNET. THE NEWS IS FLOODED WITH STORIES OF GIRLS WHO'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED. THIS PROSTHETIC IS ACTUALLY A CHIN PIECE TO KIND OF MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I'VE BEEN PUNCHED OUT. - CAN YOU LEAN YOUR HEAD BACK A LITTLE SO WE CAN SEE? all: OOH. - THAT'S BAD. - YIKES. - PROFILE PIC. THERE IT IS. - HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. - WOW. - SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS A REPRESENTATION OF CREATURES DURING DREAMS WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID. IT'S THIS BLUE LIGHT THAT'S INSIDE THEM, BUT YET, ON THE OUTSIDE, IT'S VERY FIERY AND EXOSKELETON. - SO THAT'S ALL LIGHT COMING FROM THE INSIDE. - YEAH, YEAH. YEAH. - OKAY. THANK YOU, GEAR. - WOW. - IS THAT REALLY YOU? - IT'S ME. MY BOYFRIEND WORKS IN THE OUTDOORS PROFESSION. MY FEAR IS THAT HE FREEZES TO DEATH. - AND HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING THIS ELABORATE ON YOURSELF? - I'VE NEVER DONE THE BEARD THING, AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY, LIKE, BEARD HAIR, SO I ENDED UP USING THIS STUFF, WHICH WAS JUST LIKE... - MOSS. - MOSS, YEAH. SO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S LIKE, "NATALIE LOOKS LIKE SHE'S GOING DRAG." - YOU KNOW, YOU'RE BORN NAKED AND THE REST IS DRAG. - [laughs] - THANK YOU, NATALIE. - THANKS, GUYS. - [sighs] - OH, BOY. SCARY. - YEAH, SCARY. - AND REVEALING, TOO. I FEEL LIKE I HAVE MORE INSIGHT INTO THE PAINTERS NOW. - SHANNON. - OH, MY GOD. - I MEAN, TO SHOW HERSELF JUST HIDEOUS AND DECOMPOSING IS PRETTY BRAVE. - IT'S PRETTY BRAVE. - WHAT ABOUT NATALIE? - TALK ABOUT CREATIVE. SHE'S GRABBING A WIG. SHE'S GRABBING MOSS. - YEAH. - AND GEAR. HIS WHOLE AESTHETIC WAS FORMED WITH THIS CRAZY DREAM HE HAD AS A KID. - MM-HMM. - HOW ABOUT NICOLE? - WOW. THAT'S A REAL FEAR. - CREATING THOSE WRINKLES AND THE LIVER SPOTS, LIKE, I WAS BUYING IT. - WHAT ABOUT DUTCH? - THERE'S A GUARDED ASPECT TO DUTCH. AND I REALLY FELT LIKE I GOT TO KNOW HIM BETTER. I WISH THAT HE HAD DONE HIS NECK, THOUGH. - I KNOW. - ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WELL, YOU HAVE A TOUGH DECISION ON YOUR HANDS. LET'S FIND OUT WHICH THREE PAINTERS CONQUERED THEIR FEARS THE MOST. NATALIE. SHANNON. DUTCH. PLEASE STEP FORWARD. - I SEE A LOT OF REALLY CONTRIVED PIECES, SO I'M THINKING, I GOT THIS IN THE BAG. - DUTCH HAS LEFT HIS WHOLE NECK BLANK. THEY DIDN'T SAY, "PAINT JUST YOUR FACE." I DON'T THINK THAT HE DESERVES TO WIN. - DUTCH, IT WAS THE PERFECT COMBINATION OF CREATIVITY AND TECHNIQUE. - THANK YOU. - SHANNON, GIRL, YOU SCARE ME. WELL DONE. - THANK YOU. - NATALIE, YOU WERE SO CREATIVE WITH YOUR USE OF MATERIALS. AWESOME JOB. - THANK YOU. [laughs] - THE WINNER FOR THIS CHALLENGE IS... SHANNON. - WHOO-HOO! - THANK YOU. - CONGRATULATIONS. - BRAVO, SHANNON. - I'M SUPER EXCITED. THIS ACTUALLY MEANS THAT I HAVE SOME TYPE OF AN ADVANTAGE OVER THE OTHER PAINTERS. - WELL DONE. - THANKS SO MUCH. - SO YOU READY TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR NEXT CHALLENGE? - OH, YEAH. - YES. - SO NOW THAT YOU'VE FACED YOUR DEEPEST FEARS, IT'S TIME TO FOCUS ON YOUR INNER STRENGTHS. FOR THIS CONCEPT CHALLENGE, YOU'LL BE CREATING YOUR OWN PERSONAL SUPERHERO. - YEAH! OH, MY GOSH, I LOVE SUPERHEROES. - FREAKIN' COOL, MAN. THIS IS GONNA BE BADASS. - THIS CHALLENGE ISN'T JUST ABOUT ANY SUPERHERO. THIS SUPERHERO NEEDS TO BE BASED ON YOU. AND THIS TIME AROUND, YOU'LL HAVE YOUR CHOICE OF A MALE OR FEMALE MODEL SO YOUR SUPERHERO CAN BE EITHER SEX. YOU WILL HAVE FOUR HOURS TO CREATE THIS CONCEPT CHALLENGE. - FOUR HOURS IS NOT A LOT OF TIME TO DO ANYTHING. - THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE WILL WIN $5,000 OF GLITTER FROM GLIMMER BODY ART... - [gasps] - TO BRING OUT THAT SPARKLE AND SHINE. NICOLE IS FREAKING OUT RIGHT NOW. - OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD, $5,000 WORTH OF FREAKING GLITTER. OH, MY GOD. - SHANNON, YOU HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR WINNING THE FIRST CHALLENGE. TECHNICALLY, IT'S LESS OF AN ADVANTAGE FOR YOU AND MORE OF A DISADVANTAGE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. - DUDE, ARE YOU SERIOUS? COME THE [bleep] ON, MAN. - SHANNON, YOU HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE FOR WINNING THE FIRST CHALLENGE. TECHNICALLY, IT'S LESS OF AN ADVANTAGE FOR YOU AND MORE OF A DISADVANTAGE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE 30 MINUTES OF TIME AWAY FROM ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS. - I WOULD NOT WANT THAT ADVANTAGE. I WOULDN'T WANT TO MAKE THAT DECISION. IF IT WAS ME, I PROBABLY WOULD JUST FORFEIT IT. - YOU HAVE UNTIL THE 2-HOUR MARK TO DECIDE WHO GETS 30 MINUTES TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM. - SWEET. - WOW. - OH, THAT'S HORRIBLE. - I HAVE ONE OF TWO OPTIONS. I CAN EITHER TAKE 30 MINUTES OFF OF THE STRONGEST PAINTERS, OR I CAN WAIT TO TAKE 30 MINUTES OFF THE WEAKEST PAINTER'S PIECE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M GOING TO DO. [upbeat dance music] - GUYS, I HAD A LOT OF FUN TODAY. - I COULD REALLY SEE YOU IN THE WOODS, LIKE, ALL JUST LIKE... - I KNOW, IT WAS SCARY. - OKAY, WHO WAS SURPRISED BY STUFF ON THE BACK OF MY HEAD? - IT'S LIKE THE ONE THING-- - I WASN'T-- - LIKE, IT'S MY ONE LITTLE COOL THING THAT I CAN DO. - HERE COMES MYTHICA WITH THE MYTHICA SHOW. - IF I'M GONNA SHOW MY MAD SKILLS, I'M GONNA SHOW MY MAD SKILLS. - WHY DIDN'T YOU PAINT IT BEFORE YOU PUT IT ON THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD? - I KNOW, BUT I ONLY-- I COULD ONLY SACRIFICE SO MUCH TIME, YEAH. - IT WAS REALLY CREATIVE. - WELL, APPARENTLY NOT CREATIVE ENOUGH. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE MADE-- - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE MADE TOP THREE. - IT JUST WASN'T THE BEST CREATIVE. - YOU KNOW WHY YOU DIDN'T MAKE TOP THREE? YOU DIDN'T REALLY DIVE DEEP INSIDE OF MYTHICA. YOU--IT WAS, LIKE, VERY, LIKE SURFACE. - THE PAINT DIDN'T MATCH YOUR DESCRIPTION. - RIGHT. - RIGHT. - WELL, YOU'VE GOT THAT FREAKIN' ADVANTAGE. - I DON'T--I REALLY DON'T KNOW UNTIL TOMORROW. IT JUST DEPENDS. I'M OBVIOUSLY GONNA TRY TO PLAY THAT MOVE STRATEGICALLY SO THAT I GET TO STAY. - I DON'T WANNA GO HOME AND BE HOMELESS AGAIN. - IT'S NOT A FINANCIAL COMPETITION. I'M JUST AS FREAKIN' BROKE AS THE NEXT PERSON. WE'RE ALL ARTISTS. I AM SO SICK OF HER SAYING, "I SLEEP IN A LAUNDROMAT, AND I HAVE NO MONEY." IT'S LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY EITHER." - I DON'T WANNA HAVE A PISSING CONTEST... - RIGHT. - OF--OF WHO'S-- - I DON'T EITHER. - I'VE HAD IT. I FEEL THAT TOTAL DISCONNECT FROM THE ENTIRE GROUP. THAT'S WHEN THE SWITCH JUST FLIPS IN ME. ALL MY ANGER, RAGE, FRUSTRATION, EVERYTHING COMES OUT. AAH! - WHOA. - [crying] - OH, YEAH. THE CONCEPT CHALLENGE TODAY IS TO CREATE A SUPERHERO THAT REPRESENTS US. - [sighs] AFTER LETTING THE DEMON OUT LAST NIGHT, I ACTUALLY FEEL REALLY GOOD. I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. I'M GONNA BUILD MY ENTIRE SUPERHERO AROUND THE POSSIBILITY THAT I'M GONNA GET THE 30 MINUTES TAKEN AWAY FROM ME. - GOOD MORNING, PAINTERS. all: GOOD MORNING. - AS YOU CAN SEE, I HAVE ONE OF OUR ESTEEMED JUDGES, RU. - GOOD MORNING, RU. - GOOD MORNING. - AND I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE. - OOH. - SHE TWIRLED HER WAY INTO OUR LIVING ROOMS AND INTO OUR HEARTS AS ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST ICONIC SUPERHEROES. PLEASE WELCOME WONDER WOMAN HERSELF... - AAH! - LYNDA CARTER. [cheering] - HI! - OH, MY GOD! - [laughs] - THAT JUST ROCKED MY WORLD. - HELL YEAH. - ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THAT'S LYNDA CARTER. IT'S WONDER WOMAN. THAT'S IT. MY BUCKET LIST IS FULL. - [laughs] - YOU OKAY, SHANNON? - OH. I'M BARELY HANGING BY A THREAD. - IT'S GOOD, THOUGH. IN A GOOD WAY, RIGHT? - YEAH. LYNDA, YOU HAVE BEEN MY HERO FOR YEARS. A SYMBOL OF WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AND, YOU KNOW... - AW. - GRACE. - THAT'S SO SWEET. - SO, LYNDA, WHAT MAKES FOR A GREAT SUPERHERO? - I THINK IT COMES FROM THE INSIDE, WHAT YOUR OWN IMAGINATION IS ABLE TO BRING TO THAT CHARACTER. THAT IS REALLY WHAT WILL MAKE OR BREAK YOU. - YOU WILL HAVE FOUR HOURS TO CREATE THIS SUPERHERO. BUT REMEMBER, SHANNON HAS THE POWER TO TAKE 30 OF THOSE MINUTES AWAY FROM YOU. SHANNON, WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU LATER TO SEE WHAT YOUR STRATEGY IS. - OKAY. - YOUR TIME STARTS NOW. - HELLO. - HOW'S IT GOING? - GOOD MORNING. GOOD MORNING. - WE'RE GONNA BE PINK AND PURPLE GLITTER GALORE. - I'M NATALIE. THE SUPERHERO IS ME AS A SUPERHERO. I WANT MINE TO LOOK LIKE SUPERMAN, SO I DECIDE TO GO WITH A MAN. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING A FEMALE SUPERHERO? - UM, OKAY. - COOL! OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED. - VERY COOL. - [bleep] JUST STAY RIGHT THERE. DON'T MOVE. MY SUPERHERO IS GOING TO BE A SYMBIOTIC UNITY OF MY WIFE'S TECH AND MY CREATIVITY. MY WIFE IS PART JAPANESE, AND SHE LOVES HER HERITAGE, SO I CHOOSE TO GO WITH A RISING SUN MOTIF. - YOU GOTTA BE FAST. SO TODAY'S CHALLENGE, I'M THINKING SUPER DADDY. BE FOCUSED. - UH-HUH. - SUPER DAD HAS TO BE A MAN OF STEEL. DO ME A FAVOR, STEP TO THE LEFT FOR ME. SO MY BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR THIS PIECE IS ACHIEVING THE METAL LOOK. - I FEEL LIKE I'M DIPPED IN SILVER. - IT'S KIND OF HARD CREATING ALL OF THE LINES IN THE STRUCTURE. THAT'S A LOT OF WORK. - YEAH. both: [laugh] - [indistinct] - AND THAT EDGER. - I HAVEN'T SEEN MY BOYFRIEND IN A WHILE, AND MY MALE MODEL IS BEAUTIFUL. - I WAS LIKE, "YOUR HANDS ARE [indistinct]." - PROBABLY MORE MUSCLES THAN I'VE EVER BODY PAINTED ON. GIVE ME THAT FLEX. YEAH! IT'S YUMMY-LOOKING. [laughs] I'M SORRY I KEEP GETTIN' ALL, LIKE, SILLY. - CALM DOWN, NATALIE. CALM DOWN. - EVERYTHING TODAY IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROPHECY. MY SUPERHERO IS PRISMATICA. SHE IS A CELESTIAL BEING THAT HEALS AND FIGHTS DEMONS. I'M DOING CELESTIAL GOLD. MY STRATEGY FOR TODAY IS TO GO SIMPLE. THESE PROSTHETIC FLOWERS ARE GOING TO HELP ME SAVE TIME, BECAUSE I WON'T HAVE TO PAINT AS MUCH DETAIL. - I'M DEFINITELY WORRIED ABOUT SHANNON'S ADVANTAGE, BECAUSE SHANNON AND I HAVE VERY SIMILAR STYLES. IT BETTER NOT BE ME. I WILL BE LIVID. - THERE WE GO. - GET OUTTA HERE! [chuckles] - HELLO. SHANNON. - HI. - WOW. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK GOING ON THERE. - YEAH. - TELL ME ABOUT IT. - THE RESCUE THAT I DO WORK FOR IS CALLED SECOND CHANCE RESCUE. IT'S SUCH A HUGE PART OF MY LIFE. SO THIS IS RESCUER ROSIE, AND HER JOB IS TO SEEK OUT ANIMALS THAT NEED ASSISTANCE... - WOW. - AND PROTECT THEM. - I LOOK AT SHANNON'S PIECE. THAT DOESN'T SAY SUPERHERO TO ME, WHATSOEVER. IT LOOKS LIKE A COLLAGE OF LITTLE ANIMALS. - THANK YOU, SHANNON. - SURE. SURE. - HI, MYTHICA. - HI. - CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HER SPECIAL SUPERPOWERS ARE? - CHANNELING THE DIVINE. IT'S LIKE IF YOU AREN'T CONNECTED TO THE DIVINE, YOU HAVE NO POWER. - I DON'T THINK MYTHICA'S LOOKS LIKE A SUPERHERO. IT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THOSE, LIKE, HIPPIE PAINTINGS THAT YOU'D SEE AT, LIKE, A FESTIVAL IN OREGON. - NOW, ARE YOU A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS ABOUT POTENTIALLY GETTING 30 MINUTES TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU? - YES. THAT'S WHY I'VE WRITTEN IT INTO MY PLAN, MADE A SAFEGUARD FOR THAT. - I'D LOVE TO GIVE IT TO MYTHICA, BECAUSE SHE'S THE ONLY ONE IN THE HOUSE THAT I DON'T REALLY JIVE WITH. BUT DUTCH IS REALLY MY BIGGEST COMPETITION TO BEAT, BECAUSE HE CAN REALLY PAINT THE [bleep] OUT OF STUFF. - HELLO, DUTCH. - OH, HI. - HI. - SO WHO IS YOUR SUPERHERO? - WELL, HER NAME IS KAMIKAZE. SHE'S AN INDESTRUCTIBLE ROBOT. I WANTED TO REPRESENT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MY WIFE AND I. SHE IS MY HERO, AND WE ARE A PERFECT... - AW. - TEAM. - WITH SHANNON HAVING THAT EXTRA POWER, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THAT? - I'M A LITTLE WORRIED. I MEAN, IF I WERE UP AGAINST ME, I WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO TAKE SOME TIME AWAY FROM ME. - I DO LIKE YOUR CONFIDENCE. - WOMANIFESTO IS MY SUPERHERO'S NAME. - WAIT, EXSQUEEZE ME? SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU CHOSE A MAN TO BE YOUR FEMALE SUPERHERO. - I DID. WE ARE ALL EQUAL, SO MY MODEL KIND OF JUST, LIKE, REPRESENTS THAT. - WELL, I THINK THAT YOUR CREATIVITY IS OUTSTANDING. - THANK YOU, NATALIE. - THANKS, GUYS. - THIS IS VAUDEVILLAIN. HER SUPERPOWERS ARE BEING ABLE TO POSE AS A VILLAIN TO DISTRACT THE VILLAIN BY THROWING A FISTFUL OF GLITTER IN THE AIR AND PERFORMING, SINGING, AND DANCING FOR THEM. - INFILTRATE THE VILLAIN'S LAIR. - EXACTLY. - YES. - EXACTLY. - NICOLE, IT'S A WOMAN. SHE SHOULD BE MORE BADASS THAN THAT. - WHILE SHE IS DISTRACTING THESE VILLAINS, HER OTHER SUPERHERO FRIENDS ARE CLEANING UP WHAT THEY'VE DESTROYED. - ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT TIME? - I AM, ESPECIALLY IF SHANNON DECIDES TO... - GO AFTER YOU? - TAKE THE GLITTER FOR HERSELF AND TAKE AWAY MY 30 MINUTES. - THANK YOU, NICOLE. HI, GEAR. - HEY, WHAT'S GOIN' ON? - IS THIS INSPIRED BY YOUR DEMON FROM THE LAST CHALLENGE? - NO. THIS ONE IS BASED ON THE TETRAHEDRON. - TETRA WHO? - TETRA-- [laughs] TETRAHEDRON. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS. - YEAH, THIS IS A TETRAHEDRON. - OH. SO WHAT ARE HER SUPERPOWERS? - WELL, SHE'S GOT THE POWER TO INCREASE MY POWERS OF CREATIVITY, YOU KNOW, TRANSFORMATION AND ENERGY. - I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE EVER GONNA DECIDE ON THIS ONE. GOD. - YOU WAIT. - HELLO, FELLE. WHO'S YOUR SUPERHERO? - HE'S SUPER DADDY. I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD TODAY IS LITTLE GIRLS DON'T HAVE, YOU KNOW, FATHERS. YOU KNOW, I WAS 14 WHEN MY SON WAS BORN. - WOW. - I WAS EXTREMELY YOUNG, AND I JUST WASN'T THERE LIKE I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN. BUT GOD GAVE ME A SECOND CHANCE WHEN I HAD MY DAUGHTER. REALLY ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS THAT I'VE EVER HAD TO DO IN LIFE-- RELEASE MY DAUGHTER INTO THE WORLD. - SO THIS IS THE SUPERHERO THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR DAUGHTER? - PROTECT ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS THAT DON'T HAVE A FATHER. - AW. - WOW. - SHANNON, ARE YOU READY TO TELL US WHICH ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS WILL BE LOSING 30 MINUTES? - YES. - I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE I KNOW I'M GOING TO NEED THAT TIME TO PULL IT ALL TOGETHER. - NO OFFENSE. - IT BETTER NOT BE ME, BECAUSE I NEED THAT TIME. [suspenseful music] - MYTHICA, YOU WILL BE LOSING 30 MINUTES. - THE WAY THAT SHANNON SAYS IT IS PAINFUL. NO HESITATION. "YEP, I KNOW EXACTLY WHO I'M GONNA DO THIS TO." - OKAY, MYTHICA, PLEASE TAKE A SEAT FOR 30 MINUTES. - I'M SAD. I'M ANGRY. I'M FRUSTRATED. THIS COULD BE MY LAST DAY AND NO ONE CAN EVEN LOOK AT ME. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO A LIFE WHERE I HAVE TO BEG FOR MY SURVIVAL. - SHANNON, WHICH ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS WILL BE LOSING 30 MINUTES? - NO OFFENSE. MYTHICA, YOU WILL BE LOSING 30 MINUTES. - OKAY, MYTHICA, I'M SORRY. PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN AND TAKE A SEAT FOR 30 MINUTES. - I DECIDED THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE IT TO MYTHICA BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I AM HEAD-TO-HEAD WITH HER. THAT COULD BE THE KILL BLOW FOR HER AND HELP ME GO ONE MORE WEEK. - I WANT SHANNON TO GO HOME AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE TENSION IS JUST SO BIG. FOR THE 30 MINUTES, I KNOW I HAVE TO SHUT OUT THE WORLD AND MEDITATE. - AWESOME. - I'M FEELING REALLY, REALLY GOOD. I'M LOOKING AT WHAT I'VE ACCOMPLISHED TO THIS POINT, AND I FEEL I HAVE MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO PULL OFF WHAT I HAD ENVISIONED. - THIS IS MY CHALLENGE, AND IT IS DESTINED FOR ME. IT IS DESTINED FOR ME TO WIN $5,000 WORTH OF GLITTER. ALL RIGHT, TURN THAT WAY FOR ME. I DECIDE TO DO A FULL SUIT OF GLITTER. THERE IS SO MUCH GLITTER ON HERE RIGHT NOW. I WANT TO WIN THE GLITTER SO BAD! IF SOMEBODY ELSE WINS IT, I'M PROBABLY GONNA CRY. [laughs] - OKAY, MYTHICA, YOUR 30-MINUTE TIME-OUT IS UP. YOU CAN GET BACK TO WORK. - THE 30 MINUTES REALLY HURTS ME BECAUSE I HAVEN'T DONE ANY DETAIL WORK ON THE WINGS AT THIS POINT. AND I WAS GOING TO GO BACK AND WORK SOME MORE ON THE FLOWERS ON THE FRONT, AND I HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT AND WORK ON THE ARMS AND LEGS. YOU CAN'T BE PRISMATICA WITHOUT PRISMS. - CHECK IT OUT. WE GOT 45 MINUTES. PUT THE PEDAL TO THE METAL. LET'S DO THIS! I'M LOOKING AROUND, AND I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, ME, FELLE, AND DUTCH." WE GOT SOME PRETTY STRONG PIECES OVER HERE, SO I THINK THEY'RE MY BIGGEST COMPETITION IN THIS ONE. - WE GOT TEN MINUTES LEFT. TEN MINUTES. - PUT A LITTLE GLUE ON HIM, LET HIM COOL OFF. I'VE BEEN IN THE TOP A FEW TIMES. IT'S KIND OF GETTING FRUSTRATING. I NEED A WIN TO FEEL LIKE I'M IN THE GAME. FIVE MINUTES LEFT. - I'LL PUT THE GLUE ON ONE AND THEN LET YOU WORK ON THAT, AND THEN I'LL PUT THE GLUE ON THE OTHER ONE. - THE FLOWERS THAT MYTHICA PASTED, THEY'RE ALREADY PREMADE. SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO CREATE THEM, AND I DON'T THINK THE JUDGES ARE GONNA LIKE THAT. - ONE MINUTE LEFT! - WHOO-HOO! - TURN TO THE FRONT. I'M WORRIED BECAUSE I MIGHT BE PUTTING TOO MANY IDEAS ON MY ONE CONCEPT. - FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE. [timer beeps] - OKAY, PAINTERS, YOUR TIME IS UP. PLEASE PUT YOUR TOOLS DOWN. - YOU FEEL THIS KIND OF SICK FEELING IN MY STOMACH. NATALIE HAS AN AMAZING PIECE AND SO DOES NICOLE, AND THEY ALL LOOK LIKE SUPERHEROES, AND MINE DOESN'T. I'M REALLY CONCERNED THAT I COULD GO HOME AT THIS POINT. - WELCOME, PAINTERS. FOR THIS CHALLENGE, YOU HAD FOUR HOURS TO CREATE A SUPERHERO VERSION OF YOURSELF. I WANT TO WELCOME BACK OUR ESTEEMED JUDGES-- CRAIG TRACY, ROBIN SLONINA, RUPAUL CHARLES, AND OUR VERY SPECIAL GUEST JUDGE FOR THIS CHALLENGE, WONDER WOMAN HERSELF, LYNDA CARTER.

NATALIE, COME ON UP. TELL US ABOUT YOUR SUPERHERO. - THIS IS WOMANIFESTO. - I LOVE THOSE PALETTES ON THE BACK. - THANKS. - THEY'RE FANTASTIC. LOVE ALL THE COLORS, AND I LOVE THE POWER OF THE PIGTAIL. - NATALIE, I THINK MAYBE YOU HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH FUN. IT'S HARD TO TAKE IT SERIOUS FOR ME, AND I WANT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT IN A PIECE LIKE THIS. - OKAY. - NICOLE, I LOVE THE HEART ON THE BACK. YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE WEAR THEIR HEART ON THEIR SLEEVE. SHE WEARS HER HEART ON HER ASS. [laughter] - SHE DOES. IT WAS THE PERFECT SHAPE. - BUT IT FEELS A LITTLE CHEAP AND CHEESY AND, YOU KNOW, BURLESQUEY. - I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT HER POWER. IT DOESN'T SEEM EMPOWERING. - THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I READ INTO IT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT SHE LEFT THE DIRTY WORK FOR THE REST OF US. - VISUALLY, I FIND THIS REALLY STUNNING. I THINK THAT IT HAS A REALLY BEAUTIFUL BACKSTORY, TOO. TECHNICALLY, I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PIECE. - I THINK IT IS BRILLIANT. THERE'S DEPTH, AND I'M SO IMPRESSED. SHE COULD DEFINITELY BE ON A MOVIE POSTER. - THANK YOU. - I LOVE HOW YOU'VE INTEGRATED YOURSELF AND A FEMALE CHARACTER. I THINK THIS WAS A PERFECT CHALLENGE FOR YOU. - GREAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - SHANNON, YOU GOT A MEGA-CONCEPT HERE. I FEEL THAT IT'S JUST A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF A BUNCH OF PIECES... - MM-HMM. - INSTEAD OF A UNIFIED WHOLE. - MM-HMM. - THE EXECUTION OF THE PAINT FEELS MORE LIKE A NARRATION OF THE EXPERIENCE OF RESCUING, RATHER THAN ROSIE BEING A SUPERHERO. - MM-HMM. - MOTOWN FELLE. - YES. - I LOVE THIS. - THANK YOU. - I THINK IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL. I KEEP DISCOVERING INTRICATE DETAILS TO THIS THAT REALLY TELL THE STORY. WELL DONE. - THANK YOU. - FELLE, YOU CONTINUE TO WORK MONOCHROMATICALLY... - MM-HMM. - IN THIS COMPETITION. I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF POP. - RIGHT. - I THINK YOU DID DIG DEEP HERE, AND YOU CAME UP WITH A BEAUTIFUL PIECE IN THE PROCESS. - THANK YOU. - I GOT CHILLS. - YES. - I'M REALLY JUST BLOWN AWAY. - THANK YOU, LYNDA. IT WAS A VERY PERSONAL CHALLENGE FOR ME. TO ANY FATHER THAT'S OUT THERE THAT'S NOT TAKING CARE OF THEIR KIDS, YOU NEED TO INVEST AND CREATE AS MANY MEMORIES AS YOU CAN WITH YOUR CHILD. [voice breaks] WHOO! [laughs] - OOH, PREACH THIS EVENING. - OKAY, THANK YOU, FELLE. - OH, THANK YOU. - MYTHICA, I WAS SURPRISED AT HOW MUCH I REALLY ENJOYED THIS PIECE. - BUT WHEN I REALIZED THAT THOSE FLOWERS ARE ACTUALLY APPLIQUÉS, I WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE AT THIS STAGE OF THE COMPETITION IT'S GETTING TOUGH. I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU JUST KEPT THE PAINTING A LITTLE TOO SIMPLE ON THIS. - I HAD A LITTLE BIT LESS TIME THAN I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO HAVE. - BUT IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN YOUR SKETCH IS--IS REPRESENTED HERE. - YES. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT--THAT, YOU KNOW, I GOT THE BASICS. I KNEW THAT SOME PIECES WOULD HAVE TO BE COMPROMISED. - GEAR, I THINK YOUR WORK IS BEAUTIFUL. I WOULD DEFINITELY PUT IT IN THE GENRE OF SUPERHERO. - THANK YOU. - NOW, WERE YOU AT ALL INSPIRED BY DUTCH'S HAIR? - NO RELATION. I KNOW THEY'RE VISUAL, BUT NO. - IT SO REPRESENTS YOUR PERSONALITY... - RIGHT. - WILD AND FULL OF LIGHT AND THE COLORS REALLY SPEAK TO ME. - THANK YOU. - THIS DOES LOOK A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR... - GOTCHA. - TO THE FEAR CHALLENGE. WHAT OTHER COLORS ARE IN YOUR BOX OF CRAYONS? - THANK YOU, GEAR. PAINTERS, YOU'VE GIVEN THE JUDGES A LOT TO THINK ABOUT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TODAY. - I COULD WIN GLITTER, OR I COULD GO HOME. AND I DON'T WANNA GO HOME. - SO, JUDGES, WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE PAINTINGS? - I LOVED FELLE'S WORK. WE FINALLY SAW FELLE. - HIS NARRATIVE WAS JUST AS DEEP AND BEAUTIFUL AS HIS WORK. - AND WHAT A GREAT MESSAGE TO THE WORLD THAT HE'S TRYING TO EXPRESS. - EVERY TIME I SEE A BUTTERFLY FROM NOW ON, I'M GONNA THINK OF FELLE. - AND WHAT ABOUT DUTCH'S SUPERHERO? - THE DETAIL THAT HE GOT ON THE ARMS... - YES! - LIKE, JUST THAT HANDPIECE, THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS JUMPING OFF HER SKIN. - YOU'RE SO RIGHT. - THAT'S A SUPERHERO I WANT TO LAND WHEN THERE'S A CRISIS. RIGHT? - BUT WHICH OF THE TWO IS MORE CREATIVE? FELLE OR DUTCH? I MEAN, THEY'RE REALLY NECK AND NECK HERE. - AND HOW ABOUT GEAR? - I THINK THAT HIS WORK IS PHENOMENAL. I'M IMPRESSED WITH THE WHOLE THING. - ULTIMATELY, HE FULFILLED THE CHALLENGE. I MEAN, THAT CHARACTER COULD HAVE POPPED... - YEAH, SURE. - RIGHT OUT OF A COMIC BOOK. - ABSOLUTELY. - NICOLE'S PIECE WAS DISTRACTING. - THAT WAS KIND OF WEIRD THAT SHE WOULD SAY... - YEAH. - I'M THE DISTRACTER, BUT THEN THE OTHER ONES COME IN TO CLOSE THE DEAL. - THERE'S A THING ABOUT LETTING SOMEONE ELSE DO YOUR WORK. - YES! YEAH. - THAT-- - IT WAS A BIT WEAK. - WHAT KIND OF SUPERHERO IS THAT? - NATALIE'S WORK-- SHE GOT A LITTLE LOST. - I ENJOYED THE RISK THAT SHE TOOK TO TRY TO MAKE THAT WORK. - I THOUGHT NATALIE'S PIECE WAS A LOT OF FUN. LISTEN, I'M A SUCKER FOR A CROSS-DRESSER. both: [laugh] - SHANNON WANTS TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO HER DESIGN. IF SHE HADN'T EXPLAINED THAT PIECE, I WOULD NOT HAVE KNOWN... - RIGHT. - WHAT THAT THING WAS. - RIGHT. - AS A NARRATIVE, IT WAS FANTASTIC. BUT THE CHALLENGE WAS TO CREATE A SUPERHERO. - AND HOW ABOUT MYTHICA? - OVERALL, IT WAS BEAUTIFUL. IT WAS MAGICAL. BUT IT WAS JUST TOO SIMPLY PAINTED FOR THIS POINT IN THIS COMPETITION. - MM-HMM. - WOULD IT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FOR YOU IF SHE WOULD HAVE PAINTED THOSE CHAKRAS? - YES. - ABSOLUTELY. - ABSOLUTELY. - YES. - SO, JUDGES, HAVE YOU MADE YOUR DECISION? - YEAH. - I THINK SO. - YEAH. - DONE. - IN FOUR HOURS, YOU ALL MANAGED TO CREATE A SUPERHERO THAT WAS BOTH PERSONAL AND OUT OF THIS WORLD. EVEN THOUGH ALL OF YOU DID GREAT WORK, ONLY ONE OF YOU CAN BE THE WINNER, AND ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TONIGHT. NATALIE, YOU ARE SAFE. YOU CAN GO TO THE LOUNGE. - THANKS. - SHANNON, MYTHICA, NICOLE, PLEASE STEP FORWARD. YOU ARE THE BOTTOM THREE. PLEASE STEP TO THE SIDE. - THIS IS MY FIRST TIME BEING IN THE BOTTOM THREE, AND IT IS THE WORST FEELING IN THE WORLD. - IT FEELS REALLY HORRIBLE TO BE IN THE BOTTOM THREE AGAIN. - DUTCH, GEAR, FELLE. CONGRATULATIONS, YOU ARE THE TOP THREE. WELL DONE, GENTLEMEN. YOU REALLY ROSE TO THE TOP THIS WEEK. - THIS IS SO EXCITING FOR ME JUST TO WITNESS YOUR IMMENSE TALENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. - EACH OF YOU WERE JUST THE CONSUMMATE STORYTELLERS HERE. YOU'RE ALL SUPERHEROES. - THANK YOU. - THANK YOU. - ALL THREE OF YOU CREATED GREAT SUPERHEROES, BUT ONE SOARED HIGHER THAN THE REST. THE WINNER OF THIS CHALLENGE IS... FELLE. - YAY! [laughs] - [laughs] - I'M SO HAPPY! [laughter] [applause] - YOU'VE JUST WON $5,000 WORTH OF GLITTER FROM GLIMMER BODY ART TO BRING OUT THE SPARKLE AND SHINE IN YOUR FUTURE WORK. - DEFINITELY GONNA MAKE GOOD USE OF THAT--ALL THAT GLITTER. - GOOD. - THANK YOU, JUDGES. HONESTLY, THANK YOU. IT MEANS A LOT TO ME. - ALL THREE OF YOU ARE SAFE. YOU MAY HEAD BACK TO THE LOUNGE. - THANK YOU. NOW WE TALKIN'. NOW WE FINALLY, YOU KNOW, GETTING TO IT. I WON THIS CHALLENGE. I REALLY PULLED IT OFF. - BOYS, CONGRATS. CONGRATS! - I FEEL LIKE I'M A COMPETITOR, AND I FEEL THAT I DID A GREAT JOB. WE DID IT AGAIN, BUDS. - DID IT AGAIN. - ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER A BRIDE. - ME, TOO. [suspenseful music] - NICOLE, SHANNON, MYTHICA, ONE OF YOU IS GOING HOME. - I'VE GOT THAT SICK-TO-MY-STOMACH FEELING. WORST-CASE SCENARIO, I COULD GO HOME AT THIS POINT. - SHANNON, MYTHICA, NICOLE, UNFORTUNATELY, ONE OF YOU WILL BE GOING HOME TODAY. [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ NICOLE, THE JUDGES WISHED THAT YOUR CREATION FELT MORE LIKE A SUPERHERO AND LESS LIKE YOUR ALTER EGO. SHANNON, THE JUDGES LOVED THE STORY BEHIND YOUR CONCEPT, BUT YOUR WORK SHOULD SPEAK FOR ITSELF AND NOT HAVE TO BE EXPLAINED. MYTHICA, YOUR CONCEPT WAS CREATIVE AND DEFINITELY REPRESENTED YOU AS AN ARTIST, BUT THE JUDGES FELT THAT IT WAS JUST TOO SIMPLE. MYTHICA, YOUR TIME HERE IS UP. - I KNOW. - NICOLE, SHANNON, YOU ARE SAFE. - LOVE YOU. - I FEEL RELIEVED THAT I'M STILL HERE. I'M THINKING THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD STRATEGY. - MYTHICA, YOU ARE A TRUE ARTIST. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING SO GRACIOUS AND SO GIVING WITH YOUR TALENT AND YOUR HEALING ENERGY AND YOUR LOVE. - YES! - MYTHICA IS LOVE. - LOVE! [laughter] - THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST SPIRITUALLY CHALLENGING THINGS I'VE EVER DONE. I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM ALL OF YOU IN YOUR FEEDBACK, IN YOUR ENCOURAGEMENT, IN YOUR LOVE. MY LIFE IS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT IT CAN BE. - ALL RIGHT, MYTHICA. PLEASE GO WASH OFF YOUR CANVAS. - I'M AT PEACE WITH GOING HOME. JUST EVEN BEING ASKED TO BE A PART OF THIS COMPETITION HAS CHANGED ME. I'M NOW WORTHY. I'VE BEEN VALIDATED. I'VE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED. I TOTALLY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT I SET OUT TO DO WHEN I CAME HERE TO SKIN WARS. I REALLY WANTED TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT BODY PAINTING, REALLY, IT'S SO MUCH DEEPER THAN THE SKIN AND JUST ART, BUT THAT THERE'S A SPIRITUAL COMPONENT TO IT. AS BODY PAINTERS, WE HELP HEAL PEOPLE. AND THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN THE LAST OF ME. THERE'S NO WAY. - NEXT TIME ON SKIN WARS... WE'RE ADDING ANOTHER LAYER TO THIS CHALLENGE. - WHAT?! - YEAH! - THIS PROSTHETIC STUFF IS AMAZING. - FELLE'S CONCEPT IS NOT WHAT I WANT TO DO. - IT'S ACTUALLY-- LOOK AT THIS--TOO SMALL. - TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN. THERE ARE WEAK SPOTS IN NATALIE'S TECHNIQUE. - IF I GO HOME BECAUSE THESE BOYS ARE BASTARDS, I'M JUST GONNA HATE MYSELF. - IT'S THE WEAKEST THING YOU'VE PAINTED IN THIS COMPETITION. - NATALIE WAS THE WEAKEST LINK. - IF YOUR TEAM IS THE LOSING TEAM, WHICH ONE OF YOU WOULD GO HOME?
