 CREDIT REPORT TORU MURANISHI He's picked up almost 10 million. - Here's his property deed. - Okay. Fine. Give him 500,000 yen. Okay. Alright, Mr. Muranishi. I've set aside 500,000 for you. Thank you. Interest is ten percent every ten days. Pay the day before. - Look over the details... - I'm good. Deal. Okay. If you say so.

 It's a done deal. How did it go? I got 500,000. I only managed to get one million total myself. Hey. Hey, don't we have enough? Hey. Excuse me. Welcome. - What's up? - Hi there, Toshi. This is Chu, the bag seller. Bag seller? - He's a bini-bon broker. - I see. - I'm Muranishi. - Right. Teachers...

 Nurses... Widows... You name it. See-through panties are all the rage these days. The Fruits series from Poseidon is, too. Poseidon? The biggest bini-bon publisher in Japan. - I'll take them. - Sure. Which ones? How many you want? All of them. Hey, man. You don't need that many. - Hey now. - You opening up a shop or something? Seriously? Here. What... These are the bini-bon that people are talking about nowadays. It appears you don't carry them despite your obvious interest. I'm not interested. No need to deny it. What man could resist? That's the power of erotica. You're imagining what's inside the plastic wrapper, aren't you? Look, see how thin the censoring is? Hold on. Even if I were interested, we can't carry these kinds of books here. Is that so? Then I'll just have to make this my shop. I'd like to purchase this shop. This much... for this shop? Oh, and on top of that... I'd like to add you to my purchase. What? This is an advance on your salary. Do you want to spend your life repaying loans on this shop or join me in changing the world with erotica? Which do you choose? Man, I'm hungry. I'm going to go grab lunch. Roger. I'm starving, too. - Are you going to the diner? - Sorry? What the hell? Why's that place so crowded? "Hokudai Kanda Bookstore?" Thank you for waiting. Check it out. I swear it's exposed. See? That's wild. Sorry to keep you waiting. We'll get to you in order. A new edition is out. It's 1,500 yen. Sir, you need to see this! Come out here. What? Which way? What is it? Look! HOKUDAI KANDA BOOKSTORE ♪2 Over there and over there also. It's all Hokudai. What's going on? They're bini-bon shops. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Please come again. Next two in line. - Welcome. - Thanks. HOKUDAI KANDA BOOKSTORE #38 Are these okay here? Looks fine, I think. We're counting on you, Mr. Tayama. Sell lots and bring in profits. Porn is going to make us big. I'll do my best. Mr. Tayama. We're having an opening sale. Thirty percent off on all new magazines. - Really? - Yes. Please, come take a look. The wait won't be long. What's the matter? I'm Mori, from the Hokkaido Police. Where's the manager? - Business is good, huh? - Yeah. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Sir, the police are here. - What the hell are you doing? Sir! May I help you? Do you enjoy harassing us by opening all these branches right by our police stations? Quite the contrary, sir. Officers are our best customers, so we're making it convenient for you. We like to provide moments of pleasure for all of you serving our nation. You're selling barely legal bini-bon. Here. You could be arrested under Article 175 of the Criminal Code for the distribution of pornographic imagery. How is it? Size-wise, they're largely in the clear. Damn straight. Serves you right. Take a good look at this. - Yes. Looks censored to me. - No! Look closely. The concealing of female genitals with graphic censoring is mandated to include the "contour line." Okay? This fails to cover eight millimeters of the contour line. The opacity is also about 40%. No, it's covered! It totally is! Stop nit-picking! That's right! - He's right! - Let it be! This is just a skin wrinkle. And the opacity is 80%. Nope. It's eight millimeters short. This is part of her genitals, and the opacity isn't high enough. There's no way to tell if that line is from her privates or not. - That's right! - That's right! I'll let it slide for now. Get out of here! I know your faces now. These are for you. Take them. Keep up the good work. - It's disappearing! - You're right! So margarine really rubs off the censoring! It's almost gone! Come on. Rub harder. So? You see anything? - Who's that? - I think so! That's it. You're almost there. Here it comes! Close, but no cigar. Maybe next time. Dammit. Get out of here, old man! But it's precisely because it's hidden that you want to see more, no? Good luck, boys. Let's try it again. - Yeah! - Look at that! So, you must be the one. Chairman Muranishi of Hokkaido. I am. Do you mind coming with me for a bit? Wait a minute. Who are you? Sure, I'll come. - Let's try mayonnaise. - Mayo? Give me mayonnaise! It's not rubbing off. Let me see. I said you need to use butter, not margarine! There's no difference between margarine and butter. - Let me see. - Move. How is it? We just started. Sister Tanaka is such an angel. She is. Yeah. She forgives anything. - Anything? - Yeah. I can't wait to see your house. - Really? - Yeah. - I told my mom. - Told her what? That I'm visiting a friend's place. Round off the edges. Shut up. Stop complaining. - Let me try. - No. - I can do better. - I almost got it. You're doing it wrong. I bet you'll rip it. What are you doing? Hey. What? Who are you? Can I take a look? Megumi, don't... What's wrong with her? Let's go, guys. - Yeah. - Yeah. Let's go. Wait, Megumi? What are you doing? I'm home. Hello. Welcome home. Megumi, did you have a good prayer session? Yes. Good. Thank you for always going to church with Megumi. She's lucky to have a friend like you. Not at all... - I have some delicious cake. Come in. - Okay. - Thank you. - Come on in. Excuse me. - Oh, Akiko... - Yes? You must wash your feet first. Megumi, please show her to the washroom. Yes. Hey. - Yes? - Do you always have to do this? What do you mean? Nothing... - Welcome. - Welcome. Hey, Mama-san. Long time no see. Welcome. - Welcome! - Welcome! This way. Hi, there. Hi. Sorry, guys. I can't resist dancing to the music. Thanks. No way. You're from Poseidon? - Have a drink first. - Thank you. I understand you carry many of our magazines. Oh, do we ever! You should've told us earlier. Young lions of Sapporo. Remember them. My, no wonder they look so sharp. I'm Reika. I look forward to having you here. She's beautiful. She used to be a bini-bon model for me. Once she reached a certain age, I put her in charge of this club. Enjoying the music? Yes. The musicians seem to be enjoying themselves freely. Indeed. Jazz performers look like they're playing freely. But in fact, there are unspoken rules. Is that so? What draws me to jazz is the great balance between freedom and order. Mr. Ikezawa, will you cut to the chase? Mama-san... Your shops. I'd like to buy all of them. There's 300 million. That's the down payment. But why? Hokudai Kanda Books will continue to expand. No doubt you'll look to expand your network beyond Hokkaido. And, when you do, you and I will have to meet in an unfortunate manner. It was a pleasure meeting you. Toshi, let's go. What? Wait. Dammit! Are you serious? Yes, I want to make uncensored magazines. Do you really understand what you're saying? Look at this. Adult magazines aren't censored overseas. This is Japan. This would be criminal. Anyway, we're not interested. Get out of here. You too. You've been acting weird ever since meeting Ikezawa. HOKUEI PUBLISHING Well, no one wants to sell uncensored magazines and get arrested. Not to mention the police are watching us closely now. On to the next one. What? Are you planning to hit up every publisher in Hokkaido? What is this place? Yes? I'm Muranishi. I called earlier. Oh, right. Come in. Is this place legit? KAWADA PRODUCTIONS - Good. Yes, perfect. - Wow. Great timing. Good. That's great. - Perfect. - That's good. We're shooting for a bini-bon. Wait there a sec. Mr. Kawada, you got guests. One moment, please. I'm sorry. Please wait a little longer. Did you say ura-bon over the phone? Yes. As in uncensored magazines? That's right. I see. A guy I know who did that is now behind bars. Better to get rid of what's in the way. Mr. Kawada. What's the plan for the next set? Let's see... How would you shoot that model? - Toshi, move the chair. The orange one. - Yes? Oh, okay. Alright. Move, move. - Please stand. Over here, please. - Just a moment. May I borrow those glasses? Excuse me. - Put these on. Here. - Okay. Oh, and your clothes too. - Are you sure? - Don't worry. - Please change into these. - Is this really okay? - Help her put this on. - Okay. These will make you look even more stunning. Great. Blonde guy, come over here. - What? Who, me? - Good. - You, come here. - What? Me? Stand up. Take this off. - Toshi, lend him a hand. - Yes? Okay. - Don't make me do this. Boss! - Hands up! Do as he says! Good. Nice and wild. Okay. Now over here. Get down on all fours. Face this way. Like this. Lower, lower. That's it. Okay, then. Hold this. And put this in your other hand. Now, try stepping on him. - I don't know if that's... - Step on him. - Put your foot right here. - Really? - Firmly. - It's okay. Don't hold back. Bear with it. More! Show me more! More! Aren't you sick and tired of this pathetic guy? You're sick of him, right? Put all your weight on him. That's right... Why don't you work for once! - Super. Very nice expression. - That hurts! - Great! - You bastard! - Let it out! Explode! - Good! Yes! That's it! More! More! Dig your heels in! Take it all in. You're starting to like it more and more. Go! Keep going! Wonderful expression! Very sexy! Photographer, don't just stand there! Snap away! Yes! Give me more! You too! Feel the pleasure! Get lower. Get all of it. Feel it! More! You're in paradise! Get stomped on! That's right! You're loving it! Come on! More! - Mr. Kawada. - Yes? See this? This is how I'd do it. Porn needs a story that stimulates the mind. Oh, I'm coming... Come with me. What? Where to? To make what we want to make. That's right! Keep going! More! YOSHIKAWA PRINTING FACTORY So there's no way? Of course not. You want to make a criminal out of me? Then how about we buy this factory from you? You couldn't possibly. You don't have that much cash. Retail price is 15,000 yen per unit against a production cost of 400 yen. Are we using wholesalers? Of course not. Then the profit comes to 14,600 yen per unit. The value of this factory, including its facilities, minus the depreciation of the building, comes out to about 30 million yen. We can make that in under a month. Hey, no one agreed to... I'll give you 50 million right now. I'm going to go talk with upper management. I've been waiting years to meet someone like you. - Don't forget, I've got seniority here. - Yes. This will work. Suzuran, please. That'll be 15,000 yen. Thank you very much. I want a Suzuran, too! - Suzuran, please. - Can I get a Suzuran? - One for me, too. - It's 15,000 yen. Thank you very much. Suzuran! Suzuran, please. Suzuran! I want one, too. - Suzuran, please. - Thank you. He's pushing the envelope. He's already sold over 300,000 copies. What should we do? It seems he misunderstood what I meant by freedom. Daddy, come on! Okay, I'll be right there. Nothing ever goes as planned. Here you are. Thank you, dear. Did she really have to chase you down to our home? It's your day off. Sorry about that. Was there trouble? Just a little miscommunication with a partner. Not uncommon in the advertising business. We specifically set up this time for family bonding. I know. It must've been lonely not speaking with Daddy for a while. What? You're so silly. Don't treat me like such a kid. Good. This is perfect. Really? Let me check. Looks delicious! Look, Mommy! - Let's see. - It smells so good! - What a great chef. - I can't wait. - I'm starving. - Me too. - We haven't had his cooking in a while. - Right? Hurry. We're finished. Sorry, Fujiwara. I know you didn't join the yakuza just to haul ura-bon. I chose to follow you. Good work, guys. Keep it up. Hey. Why's a contractor smoking here? If these catch fire, you're paying. You're smoking, too. I get to because I run this place. What's your problem? We haven't sunk so low as to put up with your shit. Sorry, young man. Fujiwara, you apologize, too. My apologies. Come on, Mr. Furuya. Keep your young ones in line. Here. 400,000 yen. Good doing business with you, as always. Your ura-bon sure do sell well. I can keep raking it in for a while. I'd prefer if you bought a big bulk instead of little by little. Soon, porn will make more money than meth. I'm sure it will. - Well, then. - Thanks. Shouldn't you show that man more respect? It's fine. He's just a yakuza who's been ousted from his clan. Apparently he used to be a high-ranker, but now he's just an old fart who's clinging to ura-bon to make a living. A man needs to have a rock 'n' roll lifestyle. Make big bucks and rise above. Police car. Are you scared? No. Don't worry. I've been doing risky shit since I was in middle school. That's a checkpoint. Shit. What do we do? Make a U-turn? They'll come after us if we do. What should we do? This is bad. Hey! PLEASE STOP CHECKPOINT Good evening. Please stop the engine. Have you been drinking? No? Hey. You, popcorn hair. Yes, sir! We need to check your cargo. Please open the back. Well... You see, actually... Hurry up. - The thing is... - What? The key's broken... Hey! What the hell is he up to? Come on, open it up. Hurry up. What's he going to do? We're checking the contents. Potatoes, my ass. They're all ura-bon! You guys are in big trouble. - Don't move! - Look more closely, officer. - What are you doing? - They're clearly ura-bon. - These aren't illegal magazines. - What? See? These are children's books, right? You're right. They sure are. Right? You need to look more carefully. They're very cute books. - All right. - It'll make a good present for your baby. Nothing to see here. You can go. Shall we get going? What? Children's books containing cash. I prepared them just in case. Megumi. Finish up soon. Dinner is ready. Yes, Mother. What do you think? It looks very delicious. - Really? - Yes. I'm happy to hear that. Help yourself. Thanks, I will. But first, go wash your hands again. I just took a shower. Your hands are dirty, aren't they? Go back and wash them again. Yes. HOKKAIDO POLICE Come on. - I hear they confiscated more magazines. - Really? - Hurry up. - Hurry! PUBLIC SAFETY DIVISION Give me a break. She looks more like your wife. Hey, I heard a new edition is out. Check out her expression. - Nice. - It's Muranishi's. Muranishi's ura-bon are masterpieces. They sure are. Isn't this a carrot? Wow, it's all the way in. My, oh my. Fully exposed? Fully exposed. Any man would buy these, huh? - They sure would! - They sure would. Her face is just as sexy as her body, eh? You see? - Dirty stuff. - Right? Who the hell are you? You can't just walk in... Man, I'm jealous. Does the Hokkaido police get paid to stare at women's private parts all day? Who are you? Takei from the Tokyo Metro Police. We appreciate your visit. Seems a new branch just opened. I'm betting Hokkaido is the only prefecture where pornography has circulated this widely. This isn't just a local problem. That no-good Muranishi's ura-bon are circulating even in Tokyo, dammit! We're very sorry, sir! Thanks to you all, we've opened 47 branches in just 3 months. Let's aim for 100! Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! AIM FOR THE TOP GO FOR 100 BRANCHES HOKUDAI KANDA BOOKS 47TH BRANCH OPENING PARTY - Bottoms up! - Bottoms up! - Police! Don't move! - What? Let's see the goods. What? They're children's books. Just open it. What is this? HOKKAIDO POTATOES Take a good look, Detective. There you go. See? They're not ura-bon. They are children's books, right? Woofer, The Bear. - Are we good? - Yes. Sure, we're good. Good. I appreciate it. - Alright, arrest him. - Yes, sir. - Wait, we had a deal. - Stay still. - Hey! Isn't it business as usual? - Stay still! Who do you think you are? We're killing it! Aren't you glad you followed my lead? Look at them go. Man, I'm loving it! You guys all get bonuses! Here you go! Hey man, where are you going? I'm leaving. I'm home. - Daddy, you're home! - Hey. How have you been? I missed you. We've been well. It's been a while, Daddy. Yeah. Grandma, Daddy's home. Isn't this great, Daisuke? We're lucky. I'm back. - Have you been doing okay? - Yes. Daisuke. Here. It's your birthday present! Yay! - Aren't you kids happy to see Daddy? - A remote control car! That's cool. Here you go. Can I go play? Sure. Be careful, Daisuke. Will you come back once in a while? Of course, Mayumi. - The food looks good. - How's your new job? I want to see the children's books you're making. Oh, the books... Well... - Can you get the door? - Yes. Don't run, Daisuke. - Good evening. - Is your daddy home? Daddy! Someone's here for you. Let's have some fun. Who are you? Stay inside. Toru Muranishi? Grab him! Muranishi! Hey, Muranishi. You can't get away.
