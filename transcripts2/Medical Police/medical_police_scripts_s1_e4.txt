 - [birds chirping] - [phone keypad clacking] [Owen] Damn it! [keypad clacking continues] [Owen sighs] Oh, no, I ordered the personal pan pizza... It's fine, I'll eat it. - [keypad clacking continues] - [phone beeps] I mean, how many different four-digit combinations can there be? Like... - a hundred? - Owen, stop. The only way we're getting into Neri's phone is with Face ID, so we need to find his twin brother,

 and he could literally be anywhere in the world. Well, how many different places in the world can there be? Like, a hundred? Uh, try doubling it. This was taken at a water park, so if we could just figure out - which water park... - Water park. [exhales] I know who can help us. Okay. [phone rings] Dr. Lola Spratt? - I didn't see you on rounds today! - [Lola] Yeah, uh, long story. Hey, are you still a fan of water parks? Are you kidding me? I am a water park freak.

 - [Lola] Great. - You give me some snacks and some slides and a wave pool, and I am there. So this is a long shot, but any chance you might recognize... Voksen Futighed Water Park, in Denmark. That place is the tits. - Nice. Thank you. - Interesting thing about water parks... Oh, no, thank you. - Okay, great, let's go! - Wait, what are we supposed to do? Just fly to Denmark and ask people if they recognize - that guy? - This virus is killing people, and soon it'll be too late to stop it. Now, if you have a better suggestion, I'm all for it. If not, I suggest you park your snark in the dark and get us a flight to Denmark. [Owen] So fun! - Should've brought my suit. - Oh, hey, look! - [Owen] Excuse me! Hi. - Hello. May I ask, do the people in this photograph look familiar to you at all? No. But I wasn't here in 1971, - so... - In 1971? Yeah. Right here. [Owen] How did we miss that? Yeah, and also, looks like it was taken in France. Fu... [man] Well, duh, you didn't tell me it was taken 45 years ago! Voksen Futighed didn't even exist back then. They modeled it exactly on Parc Glissant in Marseilles, France. And how did you not notice it said France - right on the... - Okay. - [Lola] Hello! - Bonjour. - Bonjour. - Hello, this might sound like a weird question, but do you know if there's anyone working here at the park that may have also been working here back in July of 1971? Hmm. Yes. Yes? Yes, it is a very weird question. - Yeah. - Thanks. - [Lola sighs] Looks like we're outta luck. - Wait, wait, wait. I forgot to address the second part of the sentence. The... the old man that runs the Kamikaze waterslide, his name is Henri. Maybe he could help you. He's been here forever. - Yeah? - Yeah. Next time you can put those two answers together. - Thank you. - Why not just combine that? [Owen] Hi, Henri? This is a crazy long shot, but would you... [chuckles] - The Neri boys! Matteo and Franco! - Yeah. - Where did you find this? - So you do know them? Mais oui, who could forget? The twins of Tuscany! They would come here to work every summer, until... Until... [Henri] Oh, those two were the shining lights of this place. They made everyone feel like their best friends. And especially, they loved each other. This very slide, the Kamikaze, was first unveiled in the summer of '71. At the time it was the eleventh-tallest water slide in the whole world. Both boys desperately wanted to be the first to test it out. It was the only time I ever saw them quarrel. [brothers grunting] In the fight, Matteo shoved Franco down the slide. Franco was knocked unconscious on the way down. He very nearly drowned. Afterward, Franco looked up at his brother, who just smiled back without remorse. It was the smile of a lunatic. I will never forget it. They never spoke again after that day. Wow. So, do you, by any chance, know where Franco is now? I wish I could help you. The last I heard, he was living in a retirement community in Florida, called Silver Meadows, under the name of Frank Nelson. But that was almost three months ago! - Well, actually, that does help. - Yeah. ["Make it Roll" playing] ♪ Make that booty jiggle Make that booty roll ♪ ♪ Make that booty drop down Like a domino ♪ ♪ Straight to the point No foreplay ♪ ♪ I'm a booty connoisseur My forte ♪ Hi, there, I'm Bob. Are you two affiliated with the Silver Meadows scrapbooking club? Of course. Hey! What are you guys doing here? Oh! You know Dr. Glenn! - Come on in! - There you go, Harriet. You have to hold it, you have to grip it, Harriet. [Lola] Glenn, this is what you left Childrens Hospital for? [laughs] Sure is! Oh, my God. I'll tell you the whole story in a second. Hugs! Come on! Oh, you're in a towel. And look at you! Oh, God. - I miss that smell! - Okay. So, this is a, uh, a scrapbooking party? Oh, yeah, best of the year. They pay me to be on call, just in case anybody needs a little glucose, or electrolytes, or oxygen, you know, lube... Wait. Is... Is this an orgy? The answer is yes, I am doing great. Guys! I am the king of this place. I came down here to set up a state of the art STD clinic, but I got a lotta side gigs on the side and also, yes, orgy. - Okay. - Hey, Glenn. You know me, and there's nothing I like better than mature group action. - Mm-hmm. - Unfortunately, we're here on business. Oh. Is this Frank Nelson's house? Yeah, yeah, and he's right over there. - Owen, he looks just like Neri! - Frank, come on over here! I want you to meet my two very best friends. We were all doctors at Childrens Hospital in Brazil. So what brings you to this slice of paradise? Well, actually, Frank, we need a favor, and we're short on time. - Exciting. - It's about your twin brother, Matteo. [Lola] Yeah. Not exciting. Glenn, I want these two outta here now. If anybody wants me, I'll be in my scrapbooking room. Um... We actually really need to talk to him, Glenn. Well, follow me. Because if I know anything about Frank, I have a hunch that he's probably in his scrapbooking room. Oh, that's this room. Frank. We know that you and your brother weren't on the best of terms, but, right now, there are a lot of lives at risk, and there's information on Matteo's phone that can help save those lives! We just need your face to unlock his phone. [Frank] Tell me. Either one of you ever have a twin? - Of course. - Don't we all? Well, is your twin a bioterrorist? Uh, I'm actually not sure what he's been up to these days, I know he's not eating chicken. I've worked hard all my life. I'm a good man. And now I'm reaping the rich rewards of life's banquet. This is God's country. The people here walk three abreast down the street. Three abreast. So I'll ask you not to speak about my brother here, not in my corner of paradise. Now, unless, you wanna talk about scrapbooking, or have group sex... No. ...I must ask you to get the hell outta my house. We just need your face for a couple seconds. No! Out! - It was worth a try. - Come on. Follow me. Here you go, a little liquid lunch! Just what the doctors ordered. - [Glenn chuckles] - Okay. Well, listen. Why don't we just sneak into Frank's house while he's asleep and hold the phone up to his face? Ah, I wish it was that easy, but Frank sleeps with a CPAP device on his face. He has terrible apnea. Damn it. Hey, sweet set-up, man. Oh, yeah, this model was just released. It's a total game changer in the 3D printing world. What do you use it for? It's a new business venture. I 3D print copies of people's grandkids. Yeah. I can't 3D print full size bodies yet, so what I do is I take these faces and I plop them onto mannequins right over there. You know, I'm still working out the kinks. Um... I haven't sold many. Or any. But, my other businesses are booming. Yeah, tell me about those boner pills. Oh, it's pretty self-explanatory. You take a pill and you get an erection. Wait, hold on, I see where you're going with this. We can make a 3D copy of Frank's face and use it to unlock the phone! That's not at all what I was thinking! Oh, but that's a great idea. Unfortunately, you're gonna need a ton of reference photos. Wait a second! Frank's scrapbook. [gasps] Right! That thing is full of pictures of his face. Solid plan. [knocking] [whispering] Okay, the scrapbooking room is right through that back door. Come on. Oh, shit. [Glenn] Bob is passed out again. We gotta be careful not to wake him. [Owen] We'll have to move him. Come on! [Glenn] Everyone stay quiet. [silently mouthing] One, two... - [snores] - Shh, shh, shh! ♪ Rock-a-bye, baby, on the tree top ♪ [all] ♪ When the wind blows The cradle will rock ♪ ♪ When the bough breaks The cradle will fall ♪ ♪ And down will come baby Cradle and all ♪ - [silently] Yes. - [silently] Fine, okay. All on three. [whispering] One, two, three. [metal scraping loudly] [Lola, loudly] Great job! [Glenn, whispering] When did you guys become such badasses? I'd stop right there unless you wanna become worse asses. So, who are you really? It's really sort of funny. See, we're doctors, - but we are also... - On your knees! - Where'd you get that gun, Frank? - Shut up. Frank, your brother engineered a virus that could wipe out thousands. We just need to know who he works for. Well, then, talk to my brother. Frank, your brother... he's dead. [Lola] Yeah. Not just dead. Like, ripped in half. And then a dog ate his face off. - Oh, my God. - Whole face. - It was so gross. - So gross! His body fell apart, and it was like a wet sound, - it was... - His face, it was like... - [Glenn] All right! - Matteo's dead. [Owen] I'm sorry. No way! How do I know he didn't send you, huh? Hey, take it easy, Frank. Come on, man. We're friends, right? You know me! This is Glenn. Oh, no, this is all a big trick. My brother's not dead. Come on! He sent you here to wipe me out, once and for all! No, Frank, no! I... God, forgive me for this. No, Frank, come on, Frank! - Frank! - ♪ Rock-a-bye ♪ [all] ♪ Baby on the treetop ♪ - ♪ When the bough... wind blows ♪ - ♪ When the wind blows ♪ [all] ♪ The cradle will rock ♪ ♪ When the bough breaks ♪ ♪ The cradle will fall ♪ ♪ And down will come baby ♪ ♪ Cradle and all ♪ [whispering] I got it, let's go! [Glenn snoring] [whispering] That's so cute! So precious when they sleep. Let's wake him up. Glenn! Huh? Oh. I'm so sorry, I fell asleep when we were singing ♪ Rock-a-bye, baby, on the treetop... ♪ [snores] [Lola] Okay, good. Good. What's this? All right. - Yup. - [Glenn] Put that in there! - [Lola] No. Great. - [Glenn] We need angles. Okay, here I go, starting. [machine whirs] That's a perfect one, because it shows his cheekbones, see that? Sure. What about this? This is his face, - this got his face straight on. - [Glenn] Put that in there. [Owen] Two pictures scanned! Only 600 more. - [Lola] Look at this one. - Here you go, buddy, let's use this one. - Put that there. - Scanning. - Here you go. - Scanning. Guys, I need more stuff to scan! - It's coming! - Okay! Like that, put that over here. [Glenn] So, here's the extrusion right here. That's the extrusion. What happens is we move forward. [Owen] Why didn't we just unlock the phone with his actual face when he was asleep? And... - Send. - [Lola] Oh, my God. Let's see what we have. - Is it gonna start? - Okay. All right, here we go, here we go! [Glenn laughs] We just have to wait eight hours and then, we'll have it. - What? - In eight hours, we will have a replica of Frank's face. Eight hours. - Okay. - Hmm. Well, I'm not gonna crouch like this for eight hours, for sure. [printer whirs] Glenn, are you gonna watch it for eight hours? - Does it... Is it... - Yeah, it rejuvenates. It tightens it, but it brightens it. - Essentially, you take the pill... - [Owen] Right. - ...and then you get an erection. - Whoa, slow down, slow down. - I take the pill. - Right. And then you get an erection. What are you talking about? - Ah! Oh! - [printer chimes] - There it is! - Really? - Let's do it! - It's all done! Other than we have to paint it. - What? - We have to paint it. We have to do a very detailed paint job on it. - How long does it take? - I don't know, maybe another eight hours? [Owen] Wow! - That looks just like Frank. - Yeah. - Best of the best, right? - Okay, let's try it. - Unlock the phone. - Okay. Here we go. [phone beeps] - I'm in. - Oh, my God. - [Glenn chuckles] - Look at this. [Owen] These are all the cities where the virus was deployed. Wait, but, how is the virus deployed simultaneously in all of those places? Oh, my God. I know I wasn't supposed to use the 3D printer at work. In Berlin, at the German Ministry of Technology. [Lola] In São Paulo, at the Computer Center. [reporter] A mysterious virus is now being reported in... - [Lola] All the infection sites. - ...São Paulo, Berlin, - Tel Aviv, São Paulo, Berlin... - [Lola] Johannesburg. - ...and São Paulo, Berlin... - [Lola] Tel Aviv. Vancouver. All of these places had one thing in common. - Owen. - In-door toilets. - No! Think! - Three-D printers! This model 3D printer. Glenn, why did you choose this model 3D printer? Well, it's the best of the best. I mean, you can literally print anything. Even a virus. Well, that's dumb. I mean, nobody's going to pay me money to print a virus. You know, grandkids with rocking bodies, - I mean, that's a niche market... - I remember reading an article once about the future of artificial viruses. The science was sound, but the technology was years away. Looks like the tech finally caught up. That twin of a bitch! He transmitted the viral code into that model 3D printer, and that's how the virus popped up simultaneously all over the world. I just wonder why Neri only infected five cities. - Uh-oh. - What? Phase two. Oh, my God, a new wave of attacks. - Do you want me to print something else? - No! We gotta call the guy from the CDC, McIntyre's boss. Patten! Yeah. Okay. I'll call the CDC. Right, call the CBC. [operator] Center for Disease Control and Prevention. How may I direct your call? Hi, this is Dr. Lola Spratt and I need to talk to Director Patten. It's extremely urgent. Okay, you said your name is Dr. Fat? It's Spratt. Spratt, you flower pot! - Whoa. - Please hold. - Lola Spratt, I thought you were dead. - Director Patten, thank God. - It was Matteo Neri. - Slow down. - Who is Matteo Neri? - The guy who constructed the viral code - and sent it to the five target cities. - A viral code? - But how the hell-- - Three-D printers! We figured it out. That's how he deployed the virus. But there's another phase coming. It launches in three hours. Shit. Are you sure? - What kind of printers? - Outertech. - Latest model. - [Glenn] The best of the best. Call the Attorney General and then get cyber security on the line. We need to take every single Outertech 3D printer worldwide offline, stat! Yes, sir! We just might be able to stop this thing after all. What about the people already infected? We've achieved full containment at every outbreak site, we're close to formulating an antidote. Casualties were low. We got lucky. [printer whirs, powers down] [Glenn] It's shutting down. [Patten] You know, I have to admit, Spratt, I didn't have much faith in you, but you have done one hell of a job. Thank you. Thank you, sir. [chuckles] Director Patten, it's Owen Maestro, I'm also a very big part of this. Sure. Hi, I'm Glenn, I helped out, too. Thank you, Glenn. Great job all around. [all sighing] Alexander! I'm so proud to work for you, sir. What a day for the CDC. Hell of a day! I mean, we still have to find a cure for the virus, but we stopped that outbreak in its tracks. ["A Beautiful Day" playing] ♪ I don't know what tomorrow will bring ♪ ♪ So I really must say ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ Oh, yes it is, yeah ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day ♪ ♪ Whoo! ♪ ♪ So happy to be alive ♪ ♪ Beautiful day ♪ ♪ Tomorrow don't seem far away ♪ ♪ It's a beautiful day It's a beautiful day ♪ Print my schedule for tomorrow. I'm gonna need to prep for next week's appropriations committee meeting. I have a feeling that we are finally gonna get the funding we need to protect our nation. Yes, sir. [phone rings] - You got Patten. - [Barney] Patten. Senator Barney. I wanted to call and congratulate you on getting your arms around this virus situation so quickly. Real leadership. - Saved a lot of lives. - Well, thank you, Senator, but, you could really thank me at the funding hearing. Oh, the committee's already canceled that. You canceled it? You handled this emergency perfectly with the resources you already have. We have to direct our budget to the departments that are falling apart. Save the grease for the squeaky wheels, as they say. I'm sure you can understand that. We were lucky this time, Senator. If anything, this attack shows us we need to be better prepared next time! Bioterrorism poses an even bigger threat... Not bigger than 3D printers! Those damn things nearly took us all out! I am proposing legislation to ban them all. Ma'am. You are missing the point. This threat, it's not over. There are people still out there who mean to do us harm. Neri may be dead, but there will be others like him. Just waiting for us to let our guard down so they can strike again. We have many enemies. Some of them we know. But some of them, we don't. And some may be the people we least suspect. Oh! [crowd murmuring] [grunting] I'm fine. Ow!
