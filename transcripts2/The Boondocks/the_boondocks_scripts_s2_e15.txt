 Everyone, it's Thursday.
 So it's time for our Monday staff meeting.
 My name is Weggie Rudlin.
 I'm the new super-duper smart, Harvard-educated president
 of entertainment at BET.
 MAN: Yep.
 Do you know why I was given this job?
 You're super-duper smart.
 Yes. But why?
 Because you went to Harvard.
 Yes. But why would they want a super-duper smart guy
 who went to Harvard to run BET?
 MAN: I know.
 [TYPING]
 [COMPUTER BEEPS]
 Because it's time to take BET in a new direction.
 Remember the first day I showed up, I asked,
 "What's your highest-rated program?"
 And you guys said:
  106 & Park with AJ and Free.
 Yes.
 MAN: Yep.
 And I said, "Great. Fire them." Why?
 Because what you call success,
 Weggie Rudlin calls failure. And vice versa.
 See, when people ask me, have I made BET a success,
 I say no.
 [SNORING]
 It's time to redefine success.
 Because once you embrace failure,
 you can't go anywhere else but up.
 That's a business theory taught at Harvard
 called "negative elevation." Now, I may be going a too fast,
 but I'm happy to slow it down.
 Are there any questions?
 Is it true that you put a ban
 on two- and three-syllable words, man?
 Good question. Yes.
 Our research says we need to be focusing
 on the monosyllabic demographic.
 I believe lots of syllables confuses our viewers.
 Especially those in the South.
 I've got a question.
 Of course. You didn't go to Harvard.
 Do you have any experience running a network?
 Okay, see now. You're a hater.
 You're fired, so get on out of here.
 But I haven't been paid in three months.
 This is basically volunteer work for me.
 Oh. Well. Quiet down,
 so the rest of us who are getting paid
 can work, thank you.
 MAN: You're the Harvard man.
 Okay. I would like everyone
 to please look under their chairs.
 You will find a copy of the Black Panther comic book
 that I wrote. Please read it carefully.
 This is the super-cool stuff
 we'll be doing at BET from now on.
 Chicken. Are you kidding me?
 That's your complimentary lunch.
 And the orange is your new health care plan.
 Antioxidants.
 Very important. Wait.
 Nope, nope, nope. You don't get any.
 You are fired.
 Okay, let's talk about some new shows.
 As you know, we're starting BET Animation.
 Here's what I wanna see.
 I'm thinking rappers.
 Young M.C. roller skating.
 Edginess. He's going too fast. His brakes don't work.
 We'll get Tone Loc to do the voice. Okay, hm...
 How about an animated version of Hamburglar?
 He's a hungry thug. It's gritty, like The Wire.
 He does a drive-by on Burger King.
 McDonald's can co-finance.
 We'll call it, Beef.  Wait a minute.
 I'm seeing a Flintstones thing happening here.
 Dino could be a rottweiler, maybe a pit bull.
 Instead of Bedrock, we're in Africa.
 We're keeping it real. You got that?
 Got it, Weggie.
 All right. Next stop: reality.
  The Ruckus Reality Show.
 I'm digging it, I'm feeling it.
 It's what's good. Let's do that show.
 Wait a minute.
 Is this the show about the black man who hates black people?
 I hear that tone.
 The head of Viacom personally asked me to make this show.
 He was being sarcastic.
 No! Excuse me!
 Which one of us went to Harvard, huh?
 Did you go to Harvard?
 You think you understand white humor more than me?
 You know, what? Shush.
 You don't even work here anymore.
 Now, the rest of you, get a crew.
 Get out someone crossing-- Wherever that guy's from.
 And let's make  The Uncle Ruckus Show happen.

  [BUZZES]
 RUCKUS:  I wake up at a quarter to 5
  in the a.m. every morning.
  That's about 12 hours  before most niggas wake up.
  [SNICKERS]
  I am a very spiritual person.
  I start each day by thanking  the white man for the sunrise.
  For the land I walk on.  For the air I breathe.
  I also apologize for niggas.
 But Lord knows they ain't gonna  apologize for themselves.
  I am not black. Nor do I  consider myself to be black.
  Many people mistake me  for being Negro
  because they don't know  that I am currently living
  with the heartbreak  of revitiligo.
  That's a skin condition
  that's the opposite  of what Michael Jackson's got.
  Every morning, I apply  the topical ointment
  made of bleach and sulfur.
  I like to think it works.
  Luckily, I hadn't gotten much  darker in the last few years.
 As you can see here, I enjoy  building small shrines
 to certain special white people  who are important in my life.
  This one here is dedicated  to John Wayne.
  Great white man.
 Didn't take no shit from  niggas, Injuns, nor Mexicans.
 And this one here is for  George Bush the first.
  Loved him.
  Now, this one here  is dedicated
  to the most soulful  soul singer to ever live.
  [♪♪♪]
  Yeah, I work about 32 jobs  over the course of a week.
  I think it's interesting  I got 32 jobs
  when most niggas say  they can't find one.
  [LAUGHS]
  Uh, niggas.
  And one of the great  pleasures of my day
  is taking all these pretty  little white children to school
  in the morning.
  Hey, there--
  Move out of my way, fat boy.
  I keep the bus nice  and clean for 'em.
  These kids-- Oh, excuse me,  excuse me--
  Oh, hello there,  Miss Matheson--
  Whatever.
  How is my little sunshine?
  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold it right there.
  Hey, man, stop.
  Where's the gun, huh?
  Where's the gun?  Go on, get.
 Get. Get out of here.
 Go do your little  hyphy-phyphy dances
 and nigga monkey shuffle  somewhere else.
 This here bus is for  kids with a future.
  That's right. That's right.
  Get your lazy asses  some exercise.
  Y'all should just  go be rappers.
  Get into a beef and then  shoot each other.
  [CACKLES]
  Desegregation ruined  the American school system.
  When did test scores  across the country drop?
  After desegregation.
 When did drug use and violence  in schools go up?
  After desegregation.
 There were never no white kids  shooting up nothing
  before they started going  to school with niggas.
  These little angels wouldn't  even know what a gun was.
  [ALL YELLING]   The white man is  a peace-loving man.
  People say the key to fixing  the problems of Negroes
  is education.
  But I say education  is not the answer.
  Why bother?
  And what do niggas do  in college anyway?
  Oh, they go there. They party.
 Get drunk for four, five years,
  and end up just as ignorant  as when they came in.
  You ever seen these nigga  fraternities and sororities?
  You ever seen these things?
  Silliest shit I ever seen  in my life.
  You think Aristotle turned  to Achilles and said:
 "Hey, let's create a fraternity
  and jump up and down,  barking like dogs"?
  Hell no.
  White man out there  getting Nobel Prizes
  and doing business deals  in the fraternities.
  Niggas jumping up and down  with candy canes,
  and doing all kinds of silly  shit with their hands.
  People say there's no  difference between the races.
 Well, I'll tell you what,
  I've been cleaning  bathrooms for a long time.
 And I can say...white-man shit
 just don't smell the same
 as black African shit.
 See, the white man just got  a better liver.
 White man eats his meat raw.
  See, that's healthier.  He calls it tartare.
  Well, how you doing  this fine day?
  [SCREAMS]
  May I say your dookie smells  like sparkling ice water.
  Jesus!
  With a twist of lime.
  See. That's why he don't have  to wash his hands neither.
  Yes, sir. White man  has impeccable hygiene.
  Hey, there,  little mulatto girl.
  You waiting on  your daddy?
  Yes.
  [LAUGHS]
  Guess she talking about  her daddy, Tom.
  He married to a white woman.
  Lucky son of a bitch.
  There he is.
  [TIRES SQUEAL]
 [BREATHLESSLY]  Sorry I'm late, pumpkin.
  [SNICKERS]
 Lord have mercy. Tom,  is you wearing a skirt?
  This isn't a skirt, Ruckus.  It's a kilt.
 [IN SCOTTISH ACCENT]  It's part of my Scottish  heritage.
  Now, you stop that  right now.
  That's blasphemy  against Mel Gibson
  and the proud  Scottish people.
  Mel Gibson isn't Scottish.
  Hush your mouth.
  The Scottish man  deserves better
 than you making a mockery  of his history.
  But, Ruckus, I am  part Scottish.
  Thirty two point five  percent, actually.
  I just found out. I took  one of those tests
  where they trace  your DNA
  and tell you your exact  ethnic makeup.
  It's fun. You should try it.
  You 30 percent Scottish?  Black as you is?
  [LAUGHING]  I know.
  Is this a white  doctor or a darky
 that gave you this test?
  Mm, not that  it matters,
  but, yes,  he was white.
  Well, hell,  that's all you had to say.
  A white doctor is  99.9 percent reliable.
  Black doctor is an oxymoron.
  Unless it's a witch doctor.
  [SNICKERS]
  Well, well, well. Who knows?
  Maybe I'll take me  one of them tests.
  I mean, why should Alex Haley
 be the only person to discover  their roots, you know?
  [CHUCKLES]
  Huh?
  I'm-- I'm sorry. Alex what?
  You know. Alex Haley. Roots.
  What is that,  some kind of gardening show?
  You're joking, right?
 Roots. You know, Roots.
  Uh-- I-- I don't follow you.
 Roots. Roots. Roots.
  You've never heard  of Roots?
  The miniseries?  Come here, honey.
  Hold-- Hold on, here.
  [CHANTS]
 Roots.
  I don't know nothing
  about what you talking about.
 Now, the first thing  you should know about me
 is that I have  a case of the revitiligo.
  It's the opposite of  what Michael Jackson got.
  No, see, I'm not  that kind of doctor.
  I'm more of a scientist  or a technician.
  We can trace  genetic markers
  to different regions  of the world
  and know exactly  what your makeup is.
 Well, don't let this here  outer shell fool you.
 I'm as white  as they come.
 My favorite movies are  Gone with the Wind
 and Notting Hill.
 [♪♪♪]
 WEGGIE: Mistress Lee'vil,
 remember when you asked us
 for a way to destroy the minds of black children
 at an even younger age?
 Oh, sure.
 Well, you'll be happy to know that I started BET Animation
 to do just that.
 Splendid. Oh, I love cartoons.
 Especially evil ones.
 Yeah. Mistress Lee'vil. We have a kids show coming on
 called Super Cyborg  Mandingo Man. Yeah.
 We go there. He's an African warrior.
 Yes, yes. Get to the evil part.
 Well, maybe I should just show you.
 We have the pilot.
 What's that, the script?
 Actually, we spent all our money on the Vin Diesel show.
 Oh, my God, he's so awesome.
 So we got to do this one with a flip book.
 Hm. Well, it certainly is incompetent.
 But we're missing something. What are we missing, people?
 A budget?
 Uh, yes, but no.
 Talent?
 Yes, but no.
 A work ethic?
 Pride?
 Self-respect?
 What network do you work for?
 BET.
 And what does that stand for?
 Black Entertainment--
 No!
 Black Evil Television.
 It's not enough that the shows are bad.
 They have to be evil as well.
 Send in my evil henchmen!
 These are my evil henchmen:
 Big Nigga and Crazy Bitch.
 Big Nigga, Crazy Bitch,
 teach this person the meaning of black and evil.
 [BOTH GASP]
 Oh no, this mizzle didn't.
 No. Mistress Lee'vil, please.
 We'll make it more evil, I promise.
 Oh. Hell, no, this motherfucker gonna--
 [SCREAMS]
 Weggie, please! Save me!
 [SCREAMING]
 [HUMS]
 [HOWLS]
 [SNICKERS]
 [SCREAMING]
 Ah-- Ah--
 LEE'VIL: Mr. Weggie Rudlin.
 Ah-- Huh?
 This Uncle Ruckus show, how's it going?
 Uh...great. F-fantastic.
 Is it evil?
 Oh, absolutely.
 I hope so, Weggie...
 for your sake.
 [♪♪♪]
 Because if it's not evil, then,
 you know what's gonna happen.
 And by "happen," I mean you'll be killed,
 or at least very seriously injured.
 So-- So, you know, just make sure it's evil.
  Ah. Here it is.
 My test results. Can you hear  my heart beating?
  Oh, the white-man science  is amazing, ain't it?
  [♪♪♪]
  Oh, no. N--
  Th-- This--  This can't be.
  It says, I'm 102 percent  African.
  With a 2 percent  margin of error.
  Why, Lord?
  Why, Lord, why?
 [CACKLES]
 RUCKUS:  I got something
  for a fraternity  of niggas:
  a fraternity of bananas  up a tree.
  [BARKS, CACKLING]
 WEGGIE: Bananas.
 Black fraternities should have  an African name.
  Like Boogie, Boogie.
 WEGGIE: Black fraternity.
 Boogie, Boogie, Boogie.
  Hey, I got a black  fraternity for you:
  It's called prison.  Jail-Phi-Jail, nigga.
  You know--  Jail-Phi-Jail.
 [DOOR OPENS]
 Mr. Rudlin,
 there's a problem on the Ruckus shoot.
 MAN: What's the problem?
 He hasn't gotten out of bed in three days.
 He got some bad test results or something.
  [WEGGIE SQUAWKING OVER PHONE]
 Yes. Yes.
 Yes, I know you went to Harvard. Yeah.
 Okay. He said just keep filming.
  [SIGHS]
  Well, I'm black now.
  So the first thing I did  was quit all my jobs.
  [SIGHS]
  I don't know how  I'm supposed to pay the bills.
  Probably have to start  selling crack.
  Or rapping. Or rapping  about selling crack.
  You know, I might not even  have revitiligo.
  [SIGHS]
  Okay, I'm black.
  What am I supposed to do now?
  So this is it, huh?  Is this what you do all day?
  Sit there  reading books
  that make you think better  of yourself, huh?
  Black man can't get  nowhere
  with his little  pecan-sized mind.
  So now you can read.  Now what?
  What you gonna do now?
  [SIGHS]
 [LAUGHING]  Oh, uh-huh.
  Nothing. That's what  I thought.
  You know why?  'Cause we niggas. Both of us.
  And that's--
 [SOBBING]  And that's all  we ever gonna be.
  That's all we ever gonna be.
  So this is what  I have to look forward to
  as a black man, huh?
  Just sitting around,
  playing PlayStation  all day.
  [GROWLS]
  Waiting for the next  Madden to come out.
  Maybe I should go out  and put rims...
 Oh.
  ...and all kinds of goofy  shit on my truck.
  [♪♪♪]
 RUCKUS: Oh, we probably gonna die  any second now
 from one of these conditions  and diseases that niggas get.
  You name it:  diabetes, gout,
 high blood pressure,  asthma, sickle cell--
  Oh, Ruckus, stop.  This is all in your damn head.
  You the exact same fool  you were last week.
  You were black then,  you're black now,
  and you're gonna be  black tomorrow.
  Ain't nothing wrong  with being black.
  If you give it a chance,
  you might actually  like it. Mm-hm.
  Ruckus, what are  we doing here?
  Well, this is what  niggas do, right?
 Buy sneakers. Then, maybe later  we'll buy loud stereos
  and berate women  in rap lyrics.
  Is this the kind of shit
  you niggas put on your feet  nowadays?
  This look like a damn  astronaut shoe.
  I'm black. I'm not walking  to the moon.
  I'm walking to  the liquor store.
 GRANDDAD:  Ruckus, stop. Come on, man.
 RUCKUS:  LeBron James. Allen Iverson.
  Can I get a shoe named  after a white man, please?
 Excuse me. Ahem. Darky  in the zebra shirt.
  Could I get a Bruce  Jenner sneaker?
  Man, to hell  with this bullshit.
  You on your own.
 I'm not leaving here  till I get me a shoe
 named after a white man.
 John Stockton. "Pistol" Pete  Maravich. Anybody.
 MAN 1:  I ain't saying I like  the Democrats. I don't.
 But they sure as hell don't  know what the fuck they doin'.
  The Republicans? They done  fucked the country to hell.
 MAN 2:  They sure did.
 BARBER:  Nigga, just look at Iraq.
  President over there  killing black folk.
 MAN 2:  Mm-hm. They black.
  Huh. I wish they'd  send me to Iraq.
  I'd tell motherfucking Bush  to kiss my black ass.
  Now, that's enough.
  Time out, Negroes.  Time out.
 I can't sit here and let y'all  badmouth my president.
  Did any of y'all niggas  hear the president
  when he said Iraq was central  to the global war on terror?
  Or did y'all miss it because  he wasn't speaking in baboon?
  [GIBBERS]
 Instead of sitting around here  chopping the Brillo
  off each other's  heads,
  y'all should've take  your black asses to Iraq
  and help fight  for our freedom.
  A little more off  the sides, please.
  Whoa-- Whoa-- Whoa--  Whoa...
  [GROWLS]
  Damn gorilla terrorists.
 [♪♪♪]
 Just what is going on? Why have you kidnapped me?
 And now, doctor,
 we will discuss your methods of DNA testing.
 [CHUCKLES]
 No. Please. No!
 WEGGIE: Shit! Why does this always happen
 when we try to use the goddamn torture machine?!
 Can somebody please get the power back on
 so we can use the torture machine?
 MAN: I think someone forgot to pay the bill, Weggie.
 WEGGIE: Will someone pay the fucking bill?!

 Ruckus, no!
 What the hell are you guys doing?
 You were gonna let him kill hisself?
 You said just keep filming, so--
 He's the star!
 You're gonna let the star commit suicide?
 But it's...reality. I mean--
 It's The Uncle  Ruckus Show.
 If there's no Uncle Ruckus, there's no show.
 Oh, so from now on, we're supposed to stop him
 if he attempts to commit suicide?
 Yes. And I shouldn't have to tell you that.
 [CHOKING]
 You should just know it.
 Oh, shit.
 [GAGGING]
 Great. That's great. That's just great.
 [COUGHING]
 Ah, what's the point? What's the point in living?
 There's nothing to look forward to.
 Just a life of rap music and 40 ounces.
 What I'm supposed to do now, huh?
 Be somebody baby daddy?
 Hang out on the corner all day and night
 shooting dice, cops chasing me all the time.
 My body ain't made to handle a stun gun.
 Ain't got but two or three shows on TV to identify with.
 Ruckus, you make a very compelling argument.
 But I know that you're gonna get through this.
 Ha. Is this what I'm supposed
 to be reading now, huh, this?
  Vibe? The Source? Jet?
 You call this a magazine?
 Look at this. This is a pamphlet.
  "Field & Scream."  National Review.
  Soldier of Fortune.
 Those are magazines.
 This is a brochure.
  Ebony. They should call this National Geographic,
 except the photos are better.
  Essence. Essence of what? Essence of ugliness.
 Ruckus, we have a saying at BET:
 "We hate black people."
 And I know you share that same sentiment.
 But I've learned how I can use my blackness
 against the black race.
 Look at BET.
 You think we put this shit on the air
 because it's entertaining?
 You think we sit down and say:
 "Hey, let's be entertaining.
 How about a Baldwin Hills  reality show?"
 I have good taste. Gregory Hines is entertaining.
 Sammy Davis Jr., he's entertaining.
 You think I can relate to anything
 these young niggas have to say?
 No. We air this shit because we despise our audience.
 Are there other ways to make money?
 Yes, of course. Yes, yes, yes.
 But they all require more work.
 This is easy.
 And the only people who suffer--
 The only people who suffer, Ruckus...
 are black children.
 I think we both can live with that.
 Weggie Rudlin, you sure do have profound insights.
 But I don't know. I--
 I just don't think I can stand life as a darky.
 [DOOR OPENS]
 [CLEARS THROAT]
 Aha! It's you! You did this to me.
 You gave me that test.
 Yes, I know. And I came because
 there was a mistake at the lab.
 We had a black intern there I didn't know about.
 He...messed up your test.
 Here are your actual results.
 Well, I'll be.
 [MURMURING]
 [GASPS]
 Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
 How dare you mistakenly inform a man of his blackness.
 You should be ashamed to call yourself a white doctor.
 I'm...uh, sorry.
 See, Ruckus. You were worried about nothing.
 Well, Weggie, I must say,
 for a darky, you are not
 that difficult to hang around.
 Now, you said you learned all that stuff in Harvard?
 Well, I definitely didn't learn it at one of those
 historically black colleges.
 [LAUGHS]
 [BOTH CACKLING]
 Howard.
 Black college.
 Morehouse. They ought to call it Lesshouse.
 Oh, it sure feel good to be white again.
  [♪♪♪]
  I'll tell you what.
  Living even for a few days  as a black man
  gave old Uncle Ruckus a whole  new perspective on life.
  And a whole lot more sympathy  towards colored folks,
  I'll tell you that.
  Oh, look what  we have here.
 Yo, for real. We not trying  to play with you today, Ruckus.
 We're trying to  cross the street.
  Well, go right ahead.
 You young brothers  have a blessed day.
 Assalamu alaikam.
