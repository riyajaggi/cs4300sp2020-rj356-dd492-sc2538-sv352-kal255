  You're either a Michael,  a Fredo, or a Sonny. I'm going to mix us up  some things here. Oh! I love what you've done with what's left of the place. I always thought  I was a Michael, but [Chuckles] clearly,  I'm a Sonny. I'm gonna mix us up  some things here. Smoking crack  on a marble floor, it just -- it adds a "last days of Rome" vibe to the whole enterprise.  [Sniffs] Clearly, I'm a Sonny. I mean, I self-destruct,  I'm easily provoked,

 and can't handle the big job  because I cannot handle myself. I'm also always had a lot  of trouble at toll booths. [Glasses clink] What's your story anyway? It's the story of cruelty,  greed, and death. Yeah, that's gonna be  a hard pass. Only Dickens could make that kind of a tale amusing.  [Lighter clicks] You know what  the key was to that? Silly names. Abject poverty  in the Industrial Age goes down a lot smoother when it's happening  to Sweedlepipe Chuzzlewit. Shut up!

 Shut up! Shut up! [Bottle topper pops,  lighter clicks] Well...  [Chuckles] Fix -- Oh! [Blows landing]  Kick him in the dick! Kick him in the dick! Kick him in the dick! You take things too far.  Do you know that? Are you tired of it? Tired of always calling a game  that you never actually play? [Scoffs] [Chuckling]  Oh! Batter up!  Batter up! Batter up!  Batter up, bitch. Whoo-hoo! [Laughs] [Bottle topper pops,  glasses clink] [Lighter clicks] ♪♪ I want you to fuck me  on the front row! And I want you  to lock eyes with the saddest dad  you can find -- one that only has visitation  on the weekends. Oh, I really wish that hadn't just gotten me hard. [Laughs]  [Chuckles] ♪♪ Papa Stinker:  There's nothing in the Little  Bear League rule book that says skunks  can't play baseball. Pipsqueak:  Papa Stinker's right!  Play ball! ♪♪ Jim: Boy, I really want  to find out what happened at the end  of "Little Stinkers 2." They threw us out of there  before we could find out  who won the big game. [Lighter clicks]  I mean, you assume it's going to be the Stinkers,  but you don't know. You know, they already  greenlit part three. I mean, uh, could be  an "Empire Strikes Back"  kind of a situation. This is a franchise  that takes chances. I mean, nobody saw  the death of Susie Stinker coming at the end of part one,  but, uh, they went there. Have to get something special  from the bedroom. Ooh,  if you want to go again, I'm gonna need  a little bit more downtime. You know, anal really takes  the lead out of my pencil. And my Viagra contact moved back to, uh, uh, uh,  uh, um... I have something else  in mind. Oh.  [Chuckles] [Chuckling] What? Life is meaningless chaos. The only control  you ever have is when you create  some of your own! [Laughs]  Oh. Okay. [Laughs] [Chuckles] Uh-oh. You ready to go crazy?! I am. I just found  some random pills in the secret, little  drug pocket of my pants here. Boy, I have no idea  what these are. Well... [Exhales sharply, chuckles] You ready  for an adventure?! Yes. ♪♪ Oh, we are definitely not  on the same page about how to spend  this evening. Mnh-mnh.  Hmm. [Echoed booing] Okay, I'm about  as all-American as they come. I love baseball, hot dogs,  apple pie, rye whiskey. I never got into handguns,  though. -Let's play  Russian roulette. -Oh, my God. Jesus. I thought you were  gonna murder me. I mean, no,  you understand, right? You give off  a really murdery vibe. -[Inhales sharply] -Oh, God.  You know what? No.  I'm gonna say no to this. Come on. Because as much as I might  hate my life -- and I do -- I don't really want  to end it quite yet. Don't you? I've watched you choose death every day you've been here. I'm just suggesting we pick up the pace. Yeah, this is -- this is fast  enough for me. Seriously. I mean, you know, my friends,  my family, they -- Would what? What? They'd be devastated? You think so? There's a reason we ended up here together. We've burned every possible bridge. I'm a burden to everybody who's ever loved me... and I know the same is true of you. Yeah, it is.  [Chuckles] I mean, don't you want to know? Uh, know what? If you pull the trigger  and it goes click, are you gonna feel  relief or regret? [Exhales sharply] Pbht. That is something  I'd like to know. [Exhales sharply] All right.  Here.  [Laughs] Shit.  [Chamber clicks] What do you --  How do you start  something like this? Um...  Jesus Christ. Alright,  easy with that thing. Okay. We let the gun decide. Okay, we let the gun --  Hey. Oh, I see.  Alright. [Objects clatter] Oh boy.  [Grunts] Alright. Okay. You know what? L-L-Let -- Let me --  Shh, shh, shh, shh,  shh, shh, shh! [Sighs] It does seem to be pointing  generally in your direction. So, I figure,  got a 1 in 6 chance, right? That's -- what is that --  That's 16.66 percent. Uh, definitely faced  worse odds in my life. You probably have, too. Plus, if you factor in  gravity, the bullet is likely  to have settled towards the bottom  of the chamber there, so that means that, uh, your odds are more like -- [Gunshot]  Oh, sh-- [High-pitched ringing] Oh, shit. Oh, sh--  Oh! Oh.  Oh, my God. Oh, come on! Oh, shit.  Oh, my God. ♪♪ Ugh! ♪♪ [Bullets clinking] [Laughs] You're alive?! Oh, my God. Look at your face. [Laughs, coughs] [Monitor beeping steadily] [Exhales sharply] Hi. [Scoffs] You took me to the hospital? Pussy. Alright, now, the doctor says  you're gonna be just fine. You were very fortunate. The bullet just grazed  your scalp. Hey, e-easy there.  Suicide watch. It's gonna be like that  for the next 24 hours. You just let me know if you need  me to get you a sip of water or to scratch an itch  or go down on you. Always said I'd do that  anytime, anyplace, and this would definitely  put that to the test. Can't believe I flinched like a little bitch. Well, apparently,  it's very normal to flinch when a gun is pressed  to your temple. Yeah, foolproof is right here,  underneath the chin. Just remembered the doctor told me  not to share that with you. God damn it.  I think -- Whoa. I think those -- I think the pills I took  are starting to kick in. How are you still here? Uh, it is after visiting hours,  but having scurvy makes you somewhat  of a medical celebrity with special privileges. No, stupid, why didn't you drop me off and leave? Well, I had to know,  God damn it. I mean, you pulled the trigger,  and you lived. You feel relief or regret? No. You didn't play the game. You don't get to know. Well,  I tried to play the game. No, you didn't. You were just a tourist getting your kicks off my misery. And you think you're broken because your wife  cheated on you and your daddy  didn't love you? [Voice breaking]  I know real pain.  I know real pain. Now get the fuck  out of here! [Sobs] [Sighs] [P.A. system beeps] Jim...Brockmire? Oh, God.  What? What? The doctor said that you were the one who brought her in. I just wanted  to say thank you. Oh, yes, I did. Um... was it an accident? Hmm?  Oh, God, no. No, she wanted to go.  [Sighs] She did.  But, you know, sh-- Doctor says she's, um --  she'll be alright. Yeah, I know. Don't you want her  to get better, man? I did... the first five times. Now I just want it  to be over. Eh, well, she did say that she was a tremendous  burden on everybody -- whoever loved her. Nice to know we still  agree on something. She was the CEO  of her own company. [Monitor beeping echoes] It's hard to come back from -- [Grunts] What are you doing?  Are you dancing? This looks bad, I'm sure.  I'm so sorry. I, um,  I took some mystery pills before she pulled out  the gun earlier. Oh, boy,  it must've been MDMA because, whoa, I'm vibing  on that heart monitor. You hear that? Stop now. [Echoing beeping continues] I'm sorry. I'm sure this --  Oh, this is disrespectful. God damn it. I'm so sorry.  I just -- My body, it just  has to talk right now. Ugh.  [Chuckles] What is wrong with you? So much!  Just so, so much. Just -- [Echoing beeping continues] Idiot, Brockmire. You're such a stupid idiot. [Sighs] [Echoing beeping continues] [Door closes] [Exhales sharply] [Beeping normalizes] Oh, shit. [Telephone rings] [Indistinct chatter] [P.A. system beeps] Man:  Doctor on call to room 374. Doctor on call to room 374. ♪ You'll be swell ♪ ♪ You'll be great ♪ ♪ Gonna have the whole world  on a plate ♪ ♪ Starting here, starting now ♪ ♪ Honey, everything's  coming up roses ♪ Oh, I see a lot  of new faces here, so I'm gonna introduce myself  again. My name is Jimmy,  and I work here. Now, you've joined us during  a very, very special week. This is our tribute  to Ann-Margret. Now, yesterday, we watched Ann  say hello to the world in "Bye, Bye, Birdie." Tomorrow, we're gonna see her get just covered in baked beans  in "Tommy." But right now, boy, I think  this is her best performance. This is 1971's  "Carnal Knowledge," Mike Nichols' cynical  and incisive deconstruction of repression, sexuality,  and monogamy. Also, you totally get to see  her yabbos, so [Chuckles] enjoy. ♪♪ Hey, Jimmy. ♪♪ Why didn't you call me? Oh, Charles,  I wanted to, I did, but, uh, well, at first, I wasn't sure I'd be okay. And then, after I did pull myself together, I -- well... I wasn't too sure you'd like the new me. Of course I'd like you. Everything great in my life is as result of what you and I  built together. I-I love you, Jim. [Crying] I-I love you, too, Ch--  I love you, too. I think this is the first time  I've seen you cry without being drunk  or watching "Field of Dreams." [Chuckles]  I'm ju-- I'm sorry. I'm, like, a newborn baby. I cry all the time now. [Sniffles]  Oh, man. Yesterday, I watched a hummingbird eat at a feeder. I sobbed so hard, I gave myself the hiccups all day. Well, um, listen, man. I came with some good news. Oakland wants to bring you on  as their fill-in announcer. You'd be back  in the big leagues...finally. [Exhales sharply] How the hell  is that possible? Well, I told them  you were in rehab, and they flipped out. They want to sell it  as a redemption story. [Exhales sharply] Doesn't half the country still hate my guts for calling Art a racist? I mean, what the hell changed? Well, Art was caught putting cameras  in the girls' bathrooms at every Uncle Art's  Chicken Shack. That and he was paying his black  employees 30 percent less, but that story got  a lot less traction. Huh. I-I just -- I can't believe  that I keep getting chance after chance like this,  can you? Well, yeah.  It's white privilege. [Sighs] So, is that a yes  to Oakland? Oh, Charles, I don't know. I mean, I figured out  how to live here. Out there's an entirely  different story. You can't hide forever,  Jim. Yeah, sure I can. I probably should, too, Charles. I mean, I'm an alcoholic, and I'm a drug addict. And a baseball man. That's where  you'll always belong. Well... does this mean you'd be coming with me? No. I've built something  in New Orleans. I have to stay. But I'll always  be in your life. I know you've lost  a few friends,  but I haven't. I'm not gonna let you ruin  my perfect record. [Sobs]  Thank you, Charles. Alright. [Crying] Sorry. Geez. I'm ridiculous. I'm --  It's a lot. I'm fine. Just pretend I'm not crying. Seriously.  Pull yourself together. This -- This--  This is a lot. Sorry.  [Sobs] But, uh, I think  I've found someone to help you get settled  in Oakland. Oh, come on. Hi.  [Chuckles] [Laughs] Hey.  Hi. You look great. No, you look great. [Heel clacks]  Thank you. [Laughs] Hey, did I hear that the Frackers won the pennant this year? -They did.  -Oh, my God. My God, Jules,  congratulations. I also did some consulting work for Scranton Wilkes-Barre  last season. That's the Yankees'  AAA team. Oh, come on.  That's big time! I'm --  I'm very impressed. Oh, boy.  Congrats, Jules. Thank you. Alright, look, um... ...I do want  to tell you something. Hey, I thought there were  going to be tits in this movie. There will be.  There will. So far, it's just a whole lot  of Art Garfunkel. Well, it's also a young Mike Nichols growing as a visual artist and a very restrained  performance by a young Jack Nicholson. But maybe your junky ass don't see so good  anymore, huh? Is that the problem?  It's okay. Huh? Get -- Get out of here! Hey, hey, hey.  Go on! -Hey! Hey!  -No, they can't be -- Sorry. Sorry.  Calm down. I'm sorry!  I'm sorry. [Clicks tongue] Is there some place private  we could talk? Yeah, of course.  I'm sorry. Just go right --  right in there. Well, this is my room. [Both chuckle] Got kind of a lot of down time here, so I work through some of that by kind of compulsively painting. I see that face in my dreams  every single night. I figure it's got to mean something, right? [Sniffs] That's Pete Rose. No, it's not! [Chuckles] Holy shit.  That's Pete Rose. Yep. Shit! Well... not doing that anymore. Fricking hate Pete Rose. [Chuckles] Not funny. I spent a lot of time on this shit. [Chuckles nervously] So, you.  [Chuckles] Yeah, hey. If you went through  all 12 steps, how come I never got  my amends? That's the best part of having  your friends get sober -- the apology tour. Right.  Hey. Hey, you can start with the time  you pissed the bed and tried to convince me  I'd done it. Oh, shit.  I couldn't produce  that much urine in a week. [Laughs] I'm gonna call that, but it sounds like me, and I do apologize  for that. But thing is that the program dictates we're not supposed to make amends if doing so would cause injury  to others. So, you know, I figured if you were happy and everything, I wouldn't reopen  old wounds. You know. Please.  I am the toughest guy you know. -[Exhales sharply]  -Hit me with your best shot. Give me your most dangerous apology. [Inhales deeply] [Sighs] Alright. Well... [Sighs] You know, it took me coming here to understand the truth that you just kept trying to tell me, that life is a series  of choices. And ultimately, I really didn't have the power to make  different ones. You know, the moments that I beat myself up over the most -- and not the dark ones, those just led me on the path to sobriety. No, it -- What keeps me up at night is every single time I walked away from you. Now, every choice I made that took me in the opposite  direction of you, [Slaps thigh] that was the wrong one. Jules... I'm so sorry I couldn't be a better man to you. I am. I mean, in a life  so full of regrets, you'll always  be my biggest one. That's what  you were afraid to tell me? Shit. Just wish I had recorded it so I could have it for my ringtone. Well, I'm glad that my words could bring you some comfort, but...  Thank you. ...we are supposed to back up our words with positive actions. So...  Oh. ...Jules, if there's anything  I can do for you to make it up to you,  anything, I want you to let me know, okay? Okay. [Exhales sharply] I-I want you to say healthy. That's what you need  to focus on right now, okay? Okay.  Alright. Oh, I --  You ready to go to Oakland? Oakland?  No. God, no. You know, I mean, I'll try my best and go anyway, but -- Yeah, you will. Yeah, I will. There's one thing  I'd like to do before I get out of here,  though. [Insects chirping] So, how's it going, Charles?  How's Yvonne? She's good. Yeah, really good. Um... she cheated on me, uh, with my friend Dave, and, well, they're in love now, and she's pregnant. And somehow,  they convinced me it would be a good idea for them to live in my house. So, every day's  a waking nightmare. Charles, you were forced  at a very young age to do some very adult  things, not the least of which  was taking care of me. Which you did very well,  by the way. But you know what? You still got a lot  of growing yet to do. Your best is yet to come.  I promise you. Thanks, Jim. [Pats back] Hey. Gents. Oh, man. Well, you can't expect  me to stay sober in a place  this depressing. [Liquid pours] [Scoffs] So, the suspense  is killing me. What made you finally  pussy out and get sober? [Chuckles] I just got tired of being such  a burden on all my loved ones. And I realized that my death  was probably not gonna be a solution to that problem. If anything, it was just gonna  make it more permanent. No, if I wanted to undo  all the damage that I had done, I was gonna have to become  a sober, responsible adult for the first time  in my life. And maybe, just maybe,  if I did that, I'd be fortunate enough  to get to do things like spend time  with you two again. My guess  was gonna be heroin. No. No drug could have ever gotten  me to that place of truth, believe me. I think you're wildly  underestimating heroin. [Chuckles] I just want to do all the things I never had time for before. Like watch this sunset,  for example. Okay, how long  do I have to do this before I'm able to say  that I did it? -Most people wait 'til  it's actually completely set. -[Sighs] ♪♪ Well, Jesus Christ.  Is it even moving? ["Everything's Coming Up Roses"  plays] -Was there a time  when this was fun? -♪ Everything's  coming up roses ♪ ♪ For me and for you ♪
