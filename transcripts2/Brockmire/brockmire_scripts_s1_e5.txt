 Was her only line, "I am your wife?" It was kind of her catchphrase. Look, "Puso Sa Puso" might not have passed the Bechdel Test or anything, but I'm telling you... It was a big, fat hit. - I loved it. - I didn't. That was physically painful to watch. Like my body was rejecting it while watching it. Okay, don't listen to him. He just... I want a physical copy so I can burn it. He's too young to realize

 how brilliant your impersonation of Bruce Boxleitner was. You're thinking of "Scarecrow and Mrs. King." I meant, um, no, your impersonation of Pierce Brosnan. I was "Remington Steele." I was Robert Wagner. But look, I don't want to dwell on the over-abundance of '80s romantic crime procedurals. I just wanted you guys to see that I was actually famous for something besides - having a legendary meltdown. - Mm! The second meltdown video is trending on Twitter again. What? That was two days ago. Who's still watching that stupid thing? Well, I mean, it got a big boost

 when it circulated through local and national news. How is Jim Brockmire yelling at a minor-league ball game national news? The news now is pretty much anything that was on the Internet yesterday. This is your baptism, people! Bathe in the blood of the people who have wronged you! And come out cleansed on the other side. It's not a big deal. So a couple of people saw your new video. 2,800,014. Holy shit! And 90. You just said 14. I'm sorry. I'm refreshing it. It's addictive. 2,800,206! 10! Charles, I like you, but if you keep saying numbers, I'm gonna take this game bat that George Brett signed, "To Jim, you are where it's bat," and I'm gonna tunnel it straight up... All right. You're overreacting! Oh, no, hey. No, I'm not. You do not know what it's like to see the same exact look in every stranger's eye... the look that says, "I already know who you are, and I just can't wait for you to lose your shit again." This isn't like last time, Jim! I know. Last time, I could lock myself in a motel room and eat quaaludes until I hit rock bottom. But now... This is rock bottom. There it is. And there's not a 'lude in sight, so... Now where am I supposed to go? Last time, you were a national personality. This time, no one even knows where to find you! We have to make sure everybody knows where to find him. I can tag the location of the stadium in the video. Ooh! And the home schedule. And if you mention the video, you get two-for-one tickets. Wait, wait. Don't you feel bad about using Jim like this? Aren't you guys in a serious relationship? I can't let my relationship with him interfere with this plan! Gary and Pennsylvania Shale are torpedoing attendance. I need this! And he's tougher than he looks. He cries every day. Only when he's blacked-out drunk. And besides, he's happiest when he's in the public eye. - There he is! - No, no, no. Please, no. - I don't do that. - Sir! Please! Hey, crazy mother Do something crazy, mother. I'll be right back, okay? Excuse me, folks! - This mother. - Hey! Okay, come on, people. Please! All right, okay. Everybody just relax! Hey! Hey! You want to see me lose my shit? Is that what you want? That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? Oh, God. Man... All right. Sorry. I'm... Excuse me, everyone. Hi. That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? The hell is wrong with these assholes? - I'm getting mobbed down there. - Hey, hey. They are not assholes. They just want a little bit of heat from your Internet fame, like that you kid you just screamed at downstairs. It just happened. How do you know about that? Because that's Pussyhound14! He has 4 million followers on Vine. He uploaded the video of you just now. 80,000 loops already. That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? Oh, God. Yeah, I hate everybody. Hey, look. Screaming about a 10-year-old's dick... that is really on brand. I just want to applaud you for that. That's what gets you hard, you... piece of shit? Swing and a miss. Strike 2. That makes the count 2 and 2. You may have noticed that Pedro Uribe is using a very unique bat. Most bats are made of maple or ash, but Uribe is holding a piece of birch in his hand. Birch combines the strength of mahogany with some of the natural give of a willow or, well, even a palm. Hey. Are you being intentionally boring so you don't end up in another video? No, no, no, no, no. I'm ju... I'm educating these fans on the different types of wood. That better be vodka. That's not water, is it? Hey. I don't need alcohol to make it through the day. Oh, that is awful. Oh, my God! 70% of the earth is made up of that shit? Ugh! How do the fish do it? Something interesting. Cedar is an interesting wood. It naturally grabs odor. That was boring as shit, Brockmire. They won the game 14 to 6. Whatever. Eat a dick. He's not wrong. Look, I know I let you down today, but I have to let some of this attention die down, all right? You don't know what it's like to have the whole world know you for your worst qualities. Better than being anonymous. Since the divorce, my kids won't ever call me back... Oh, Jesus Christ, Johnny the Hat. I'm trying to have a conversation over here. Since the kids won't call me... My son... He doesn't know... He doesn't... I'm his dad. What do you really want? What gets you out of bed in the morning? Uh, the urge to pee, usually. Bullshit. Deep down, you want to call games in the majors again. That's what you want. You came to America to crawl your way back up to the top. Look, even if that were true, this kind of publicity is not helping. Are you kidding? This publicity is the only thing that can help! Well, maybe I don't want it that way, huh? Well, tell me another way! I mean... nobody cares that you're good at calling baseball games. What they care about is that you're a charismatic open wound! The spotlight found you again. If you step into it, you can take it anywhere you want. Well, I'm gonna have to think on this. Jim Brockmire was stuck. Ironically, the very instrument of his destruction... the Internet... could also be his salvation. But was that ironic? Brockmire wasn't always sure about the definition, and that Alanis Morissette was no help. "10,000 spoons when all you need a knife" would only be ironic if she was trapped inside some kind of a knife factory. Does he know that he's talking out loud? It's like his way of processing things. It'll be over soon. Truth was, he was tired of his own scent. "Desperation by Jim Brockmire." And if internet fame was, in fact, his golden ticket back to the Major Leagues, well, he would suck Willy Wonka's dick just to get his hands on it. Johnny always wore his hat because it was the last thing his kids got for him. Johnny always wore his hat 'cause his kids got it for him on the last Father's Day he ever saw them. It was used. Probably left in the couch cushions by one of his wife's sex boyfriends. Hey, Johnny the Hat, please. Giving introspective monologues in the third person... that's my thing. Sitting sadly alone over there... that's yours. I don't like my thing. I would like a new thing. That ball cannot be buried in a Jewish cemetery because it just got tattooed! I don't see why that's funny, but how many hit... hits? does that have? Uh, 200,000. 200... And that's cat-me. I'm real me. I ought to be calling games again in no time! Yeah. What, why are you making that face? Huh? Oh, this is just... This is my normal face. No, that's your worried face. That's the face you make when I peel the labels off my pill bottles and play "Chemical Roulette" with myself. Uh, we're reaching the end of our Internet-fame cycle, and these things move very fast. It starts with videos, then memes, conventional media, late-night monologues, and then finally, if my mom's seen it, we're dead. Well, how long does all that take? Five days, a week tops. And my mom just sent me the link. - We need to hurry. - Well, hey. Put me in, Coach. I mean, uh, what's the plan? Okay, um, if we're going to immediately capitalize on your fame, then we need to take a shotgun approach. Just insert you into a bunch of popular video formats like acoustic versions of songs, charity dares, playful dogs with Down Syndrome. But if none of those hit, then I'm afraid we're gonna have to start moving our way into creepy YouTube. Like ASMR. What is ASM... All right. Now, I'm gonna be whispering about haircuts and maybe some bobcats. And then I'm gonna run my hands across these beads. I'll be doing that for about an hour and a half. Okay. So all of our other videos failed, but at least this one's doing... fairly well. Somebody just commented that it feels like Brockmire just gave his brain a handjob. Mleh. Speh. I'm calling it. We are done here. Just... I got you an interview. I got you an interview on network television. Oh, my God. That's incredible! I mean, I wish you would have told me before I seduced a curtain, but... hey, why didn't you think of that, huh? I don't know. No one my age watches network TV. They're gonna fly you to New York, and you'll be able to tell your side of the story. Oh, my God. I have been waiting 10 years to tell my side of the story. I feel just like O.J. I know it. This is gonna be just the thing I need to get myself back into baseball. Yeah, yeah. This might work. Because nobody my age watches baseball, either. Shut up. I mean, seriously, it's like the wardrobe of a Filipino gigolo. You say that like it's a bad thing. Hey. Wh... uh, aren't you gonna pack my jacket? Am I gonna pack your jacket? Are you crazy? It's iconic. It's also how I smuggle drugs onto airplanes. - What?! - Oh, yeah. What do you mean? I got a little secret compartment right by the armpit. What? And 20 years of B.O. masks the scent from the dogs. - No! - Oh, yeah. You know, I'm a little nervous. Last time I went on national TV, it, uh... it did not go well. I'm serious. This might be my last chance. Really. What if I... I screw it all up? Baby, you won't. Just remember... never answer the question they ask. Answer the question you wish they had asked. And at some point, stare off in the distance, make your lip quiver a little bit, and seem like you're gonna break down, and then smile through it. 'Cause they... they just eat that shit up. Okay? All right. Hey, this things looks cleaner to me. Oh, yeah. I was able to get most of the obvious stains out. Well, aren't you the sweetest thing? You want a hit? Of your B.O. joint? Sure, I'll take a little. Thought you might. You are as advertised. Well, very important to stay hydrated, Bill. Darling? I look all right? - Tie straight, hair good? - Mm-hmm. All right. Let's roll. So, Jim Brockmire, how are you? Well, still dreaming about getting back to the Major Leagues. That's how I am, Bill Douglas. - Uh, how are you? - I'm... I'm fine, thanks. Seriously, though, Bill. I do miss it. I miss having the best seat in the house for the best game in the world and making every single moment come alive for people. Just, uh... O-On a good day... ...it feels like... you're a slice of apple in America's favorite kind of pie, or something. What a great way to put that. Hey! Everybody shut up! Jim's coming on in a few minutes. He might mention us on TV and give our lives meaning. Hoo. You know, this whole experience had made me realize something. There are only three kinds of people in America... rich people, poor people, and famous people. Rich people are just poor people with money. No, the only truly worthwhile thing is being famous. And after this little interview airs, this famous guy is gonna be well on his way back to calling Major League baseball games again. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Shh! Good evening. I'm Bill Douglas. Tonight's surprisingly candid and heartfelt interview with Jim Brockmire... will not be seen, as we have breaking news. - What?! - No, no, no! What are you talking about?! - Oh, you cock-swallowing turds! - Shh. A Taylor Swift-Drake sex tape has leaked online. Some people had sex. So what? TMZ already has an estimate of his dick size! I'm so sorry. We are devoting our entire show... Ha! ...to this disgusting invasion of privacy. Swallow a turd! Why did they cancel "Puso to P-Puso?" "Puso Sa Puso." Something about copyright infringement. I don't know. Robert Wagner... he's got eyes everywhere. Anyway, I'm gonna die... alone and penniless and in this piss puddle. - Hey! You're not alone! - I'm sorry. Just... Just penniless and in this piss puddle. That's the spirit. I have not been this disappointed since I owned a racehorse with Al Michaels and O.J. Simpson called Nags to Riches. It's 5:00 A.M. Let's go. No, I want... I want to hear the rest of the story. Sorry, kid. Everybody always wants to hear the end of the story. That's the one gift that God gave me that he did not wrap in shit. Let's get out of here. Too bad you can't get famous jut for telling stories, huh? Wait! Hey! Wait! That's it! That's it! Listen. We need something... that will play to your strengths of loving the sound of your own voice and talking forever. Podcasts. It's like radio, but it's not on the radio. I mean, if you'd asked me who's more likely to commit murder, I would have said Al Michaels, not O.J. Simpson. One time at the track, I saw Al Michaels slap a dwarf because he did not like the look on his face. I said, "Al, that's just the man's face." I don't know, there's a lesson in there somewhere, but I'll be darned if I know what it is. Anywhoodles, I have been Jim Brockmire, and this has been my first podcast. I... Are you kidding? I... Uh, pl... Before we leave you, My goodness. Ah! Brockmire, what are you doing? Shit. Sorry. Force of habit. Who is it? Jim, Jules! Open up! - Oh, my God. - Look. Hey. Okay, I had to come over as soon as I heard. - Heard what? - "This American Life." Jim, come here. Or stay. It's okay. This is... This is an excerpt from Internet celebrity Jim Brockmire's new podcast, "Brock Bottom." That's what he calls it... it's "Brock Bottom." Each episode of the show includes everything from shameful stories about his past to these improvised rants during games. I have to say, this is like nothing else out there. I cannot recommend it highly enough. He likes him? That's neat. That guy's voice is like a human nap. I'm going back to bed. Jim, you don't get it! This is Ira Glass! He is the King Dick of non-profit media. Look, getting a recommendation from him is like... hall-of-famer... baseball guy saying that, um... other baseball person is going to be the next great... - ...shortstop? - I'm gonna have to insist that you learn something about baseball. Jim! Come on! He vouched for you! Hell, he recommended you! We are in the big time now. You may not feel it now, but you better strap in 'cause you're about to feel the Glass bump. - That's right. - Get out of my house. Okay. All right. - Get ready, Jim! - Get out. - Get ready for it! - Get out! Today, we bring you stories of comeback kids. Coming up later, and your bird can sing! The incredible tale of one endangered California condor, but first... Blast from the Pastime... Can baseball save a town destroyed by fracking? Jim Brockmire thinks it can. Never mind. Uh, hey there. Uh, Charles. Hey. Um, who are all these bespectacled and ironically dressed people? Remember when I told you about the Glass bump? You got his fans. Rich white people who feel bad about being rich and white who want an authentic experience that doesn't scare them. Uh-huh. Howdy, folks. Hi! Mark! Find the money in the stands. If they're wearing a shirt for a band you've never heard of, keep the beers flowing. Jules. What the hell is going on? This place looks like a god damn Vassar College reunion. I don't have time for your bullshit, Gary. Pennsylvania Shale may be just a mom-and-pop natural-gas company that barely makes $2 billion a year. But if you and Ira Glass think you can crush us under the boot of NPR, get ready for a big surprise. We can fight just as dirty as... Nobody fights dirtier than me. Hey, anybody seen Brockmire? That was a direct hit. Direct hit. We are definitely not the only Brock-Heads in our neighborhood. - Brock-Heads? - We would love to lure you out to Brooklyn for a show. - Yeah. - So, uh, honey... - Here. - Okay. Huh. Well, thank you, folks. Very nice to meet both of you. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Come on, honey. Okay. - Hi. - Oh! Excuse me a second. Hey. - Hey. - Look at this! Can you believe this, darling? I owe it all to you. Um, actually, I'm the one who came up with the podcasts. Yeah, but she was the one that convinced me to follow my dream, all right? A dream which is looking like it's gonna get me the hell out of Morristown, baby. So we are celebrating tonight, and I mean big time. - I can't drink. - What are you talking about? Uh-oh. You got one of them... one of them UTIs again? You on the antibiotics? All right. No booze, no booze. Hey. We'll just stick to the yayo. I'm pregnant. Oh. Attaboy. Sorry. Oh, Jesus. Get out of here!
