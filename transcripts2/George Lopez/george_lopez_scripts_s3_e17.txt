 DANCE! NO!  THAT´S NOT THE GOOD PART. SHE CAN´T MAKE IT TO THE SALES CONFERENCE  IN LAS VEGAS, SO THEY ASKED ME TO GO. VEGAS, ALL RIGHT!  I´M GOING TO VEGAS! I´M GONNA BE LIKE  THAT IN THE CASINO. NO, YOU´RE NOT. WHY NOT? BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS  TO WATCH THE KIDS, AND THAT SOMEONE IS... [ WHISTLES ] BOOP. YOU KNOW, I -- I THINK I MIGHT BE COMING DOWN  WITH MENINGITIS.

 [ GROANS ] WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS AGAIN? SWELLING  OF THE BRAIN LINING. I´VE HAD IT SINCE BIRTH! GEORGE, IT´S JUST A WEEK,  AND THE KIDS ARE AT AN AGE WHERE THEY CAN ALMOST  LOOK AFTER THEMSELVES. GIVE ME THAT LETTER,  OR I AM GOING TO KILL YOU! HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY! LIKE IT KILLS  A PIECE OF YOUR HEART EVERY TIME YOU AND JASON  ARE APART? EVERYBODY HATES YOU,  YOU LOSER! THE WAY YOU HATE  GOING TO SLEEP BECAUSE EIGHT HOURS  WITHOUT JASON MAKES YOU WEEP? I´M GOING TO BEAT YOU  WITH A BAT. THE WAY YOU BEAT JASON --  THAT´S NOT IN HERE. OKAY, THAT´S ENOUGH!  ALL RIGHT! LOOK, I´M TIRED  OF YOU TWO FIGHTING. YOU´RE NOT GOING TO THE DANCE  ON FRIDAY, AND, YOU, SAY GOODBYE  TO THE SKATE PARK. THAT´S NOT FAIR, MOM.  HE STOLE MY LETTER! SO WHAT?  IT´S JUST A STUPID LETTER. SHE HIT ME WITH A BAT, MOM! HEY, DON´T LOOK AT HER.  SHE AGREES WITH ME. YES, I DO.  NOW, GO TO YOUR ROOMS, NOW. I DO NOT AGREE WITH YOU. YOU WERE TOO HARSH  WITH THEM. THAT DANCE IS REALLY  IMPORTANT TO CARMEN, AND YOU DON´T HAVE TO TAKE  AWAY THE SKATE PARK. MAX SHOULD JUST APOLOGIZE. THAT´S IT?! LOOK, ANGIE, WE´RE BEING  WAY TOO EASY ON THESE KIDS. YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOM  WOULD HAVE DONE TO ME IF I PULLED ANY OF THIS CRAP? SHE´D MAKE ME SIT ON MY HANDS  UNTIL THEY FELL ASLEEP, AND THEN SHE´D SLAP ME  WITH THEM. "WHY ARE YOU HITTING YOURSELF?  WHY ARE YOU CRYING? WIPE YOUR TEARS,"  AND I´D BE LIKE THAT. HEY, HONEY. HEY, DADDY.  WHO´S MAKING DINNER? WELL, LET´S SEE. TRADITIONALLY,  IF THE REIGNING PRINCESS IS AT A STUPID MAKEUP  CONVENTION, THE RUNNER-UP,  THAT´S YOU, MUST FULFILL HER DUTIES. HERE´S YOUR CROWN  AND YOUR SCEPTER. NOW, CRY HYSTERICALLY  AND START COOKING. HEY, MAX,  THOSE TRUCKS ARE EXPENSIVE. YOU BETTER NOT BE DRIVING IT  OFF THE TABLE. DON´T WORRY. I WOULDN´T DO SOMETHING  THAT STUPID. IT WORKED! I BUILT A RAMP  UP IN MY ROOM, AND THE CAR JUMPED  ALL THE WAY DOWN ONTO THE PICNIC TABLE. ISN´T THAT AWESOME?! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? LOOK, WE DON´T BUY YOU TOYS  JUST SO YOU CAN DESTROY ´EM. BUT I´M GONNA GET MORE. DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE KIDS  IN THE WORLD, MAX, WHO DON´T EVEN HAVE TOYS? AND THERE ARE KIDS WHO HAVE  A LOT MORE TOYS THAN ME, SO IT KIND OF BALANCES OUT. SIT ON YOUR HANDS! WHAT? NEVER MIND. I DON´T WANT YOU WRECKING  ANOTHER TOY, OKAY? AND I WANT YOU TO CLEAN THIS UP  RIGHT NOW. IT CAME!  OH, MY GOD, IT CAME! WHAT´S THAT? IT´S MY NEW CELLPHONE  WITH A BUILT-IN CAMERA. HA HA. CARMEN, YOU CAN´T GET  A CELLPHONE WITHOUT ASKING. DAD, DON´T WORRY.  THE PHONE IS FREE. I HAVE TO CALL TAYLOR  AND TELL HER MY PHONE CAME. I WANT TO SHOW HER HOW  EXCITED I WAS WHEN I OPENED IT. THE PLAN YOU SIGNED UP FOR  IS AN EXTRA $20 A MONTH, AND YOU´RE LOCKED IN  FOR TWO YEARS. THAT´S, LIKE, $480. DAD, THE PHONE IS FREE. YOU KNOW WHAT?  THE PHONE IS FREE, BECAUSE WE´RE SENDING  IT BACK. NO, DADDY.  I REALLY WANT THIS PHONE. I MEAN, IT´S SUPERCOOL. YOU CAN PRESS THIS BUTTON,  AND IT´LL RECORD YOUR VOICE. NO WAY! YES WAY! CARMEN, YOU REALLY WANT THIS  PHONE, DON´T YOU? I REALLY DO, DADDY! NO WAY! HEY, DID YOU CLEAN UP  THE BACKYARD LIKE I TOLD YOU? RELAX, I´LL GET IT DONE. DID I EVER TELL YOU YOU´RE DOING A FINE JOB  WITH THESE TWO? HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  GET OFF THE COMPUTER. I´M DOWNLOADING A SONG. TOO LATE.  HERE´S A NEW SONG. MOVE YOUR FEET,  LOSE YOUR SEAT. GET OFF, I´M TIRED OF YOU  ALWAYS -- DAMN IT! WHAT´S THE  MATTER WITH YOU TWO?! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH  THIS COMPUTER COSTS?! YOU HAVE THE PROTECTION  PLAN, RIGHT? NO. I DON´T HAVE  THE PROTECTION PLAN. IF I BELIEVED  IN PROTECTION PLANS, NEITHER OF YOU  WOULD BE HERE. YOU GUYS ARE SPOILED BRATS.  YOU TAKE EVERYTHING FOR GRANTED. YOU DON´T KNOW HOW GOOD  YOU HAVE IT. YOU GUYS WOULDN´T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH ONE WEEK  OF MY CHILDHOOD. OH, PLEASE. THEY WOULDN´T LAST ONE NIGHT  AT MY HOUSE. YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD  PROBABLY START CRYING THE VERY FIRST TIME  THEY HAD TO DRINK WATER OUT OF THE TAP. "OHH,  IT´S SLIGHTLY YELLOW." YOU KNOW WHAT?  LET´S DO IT. IT´S TIME I TEACH  YOU TWO KIDS A LESSON. YOU GUYS ARE SPENDING THE WEEK  AT GRANDMA BENNY´S HOUSE. NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.  WAIT A SECOND. DO THEY HAVE TO DO  WHATEVER I SAY? I HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL? YES.  OKAY, BUT NO HITTING. AND YOU CAN´T MAKE THEM  HIT THEMSELVES. [ INTRO TO WAR´S "LOW RIDER"  PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ ♫ THE LOW RIDER  IS A LITTLE HIGHER ♫ [ SIGHS ] WELCOME TO MY CHILDHOOD. DAD, WE´VE BEEN  TO GRANDMA´S HOUSE BEFORE. YEAH. WELL, YOU´VE BEEN  TO THE ZOO BEFORE, BUT YOU NEVER SPENT THE NIGHT  IN THE GORILLA´S CAGE. ALL RIGHT, LET´S GET A COUPLE  OF THINGS STRAIGHT BEFORE COCO GETS BACK. YOU GUYS ARE GONNA LIVE THIS  WEEK EXACTLY THE WAY I DID WHEN I WAS A KID. SO NO CELLPHONES,  NO COMPUTER GAMES. AND IF YOU CRY YOURSELF TO SLEEP  AT NIGHT, SAVE THE TEARS SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO DRINK  IN THE MORNING. OH, AND JUST REMEMBER. YOU HAVE NO ONE  BUT YOURSELVES TO BLAME. YOU´RE HORRIBLE,  HORRIBLE CHILDREN. ALL RIGHT. I USE YOUR DAD´S OLD ROOM  FOR STORAGE NOW, SO YOU KIDS ARE GONNA SLEEP  ON THE PULL-OUT COUCH. WHAT TIME DO WE HAVE TO  GO TO BED? I DON´T CARE.  I GOT THREE BASIC RULES -- DON´T DRINK MY BEER... DON´T TOUCH MY SMOKES... AND DON´T SNEAK UP ON ME  WHEN I´M SLEEPING. I GOT A GUN UNDER MY PILLOW. AND I SLEEP AU NATUREL. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME? STUPID CATHY  AND HER MENINGITIS. THEY CANCELED  THE CONFERENCE. WHAT HAPPENED? SHE DIED! THAT´S TOO BAD. SO, THE KIDS DROVE YOU  OUT OF THE HOUSE? THE KIDS AREN´T HERE,  ANGIE. WHERE ARE THEY? LOOK IT, LISTEN,  BEFORE YOU START, LET ME TELL YOU THAT CARMEN  AND MAX WERE ACTING SO BAD THAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT  ABOUT SENDING THEM TO MY MOM´S FOR THE WEEK. [ LAUGHING ]  THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE DUMBEST THING  YOU´VE EVER DONE. OKAY, THEN, THIS NEXT PART´S  NOT GONNA BE EASY. OH, MY GOD. YOU SENT THEM TO THE HOUSE OF THE WOMAN  WHO´S RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING  THAT´S WRONG WITH YOU? LOOK, ANGIE,  YOU WEREN´T HERE, OKAY? YOU DIDN´T SEE THE WAY  THEY ACTED. NOTHING THE KIDS  COULD EVER DO WOULD JUSTIFY SENDING THEM  TO BENNY´S! HEY, IT´S TIME TO PARTY...  HA HA. BECAUSE ANGIE´S HOME! YAY, LET´S START  THE ANGIE´S HOME PARTY! ANGIE´S HOME!  ANGIE´S HOME! Is this the right day? OKAY, I SEE  WHAT YOU´RE DOING. YOU JUST WANTED THE KIDS  OUT OF THE HOUSE SO YOU COULD HANG OUT  WITH ERNIE. THAT´S NOT TRUE, OKAY?  I´M TEACHING THEM SOMETHING. SO YOU´RE TEACHING WITH  A SIX-PACK AND A VIDEOTAPE. WHAT´S THE TAPE, ERNIE? OH, NOTHING. WHAT´S THE TAPE? HEY, I DIDN´T THINK  YOU´D BE HERE! ERNIE! IT´S "DORF ON GOLF."  YOU KNOW, THE LITTLE GUY. LIKE HE´S GOT NO LEGS. I DON´T BELIEVE YOU TWO. LISTEN, ANGIE, HE PUTS  HIS LEGS THROUGH A BED OR SOMETHING  THAT´S UNDERNEATH. HE´S GOT LEGS. YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I´M CALLING BENNY´S TO MAKE  SURE THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT. LOOK, ANGIE,  I´M SURE THEY´RE FINE. COME ON. WE LET MY MOM BABYSIT HERE  ALL THE TIME. YEAH, AND THE LAST TIME  SHE BABYSAT, WE CAME HOME, FOUND HER DRUNK  AND PASSED OUT ON THE COUCH, WITH A LIT CIGARETTE  IN HER HAND. ANGIE, THE KIDS WOULD HAVE  PUT OUT THE FIRE. [ TELEPHONE RINGING ] ALL RIGHT, WHAT´S NEXT  ON GRANDMA´S LIST? DO YOU WANT TO CLEAN  THE HAIR OUT OF THE DRAIN OR SWEEP UP THE DEAD ANTS? GRANDMA, AREN´T YOU GONNA  ANSWER THAT? IT´S PROBABLY RANDY. AREN´T YOU GETTING MARRIED  TO HIM IN, LIKE, THREE MONTHS? YEAH, BUT WHEN I DON´T  ANSWER, HE GETS MAD. I LIKE HIM A LITTLE MAD. GRANDMA? HMM? WE´RE HUNGRY. ALL RIGHT, FINE, HERE. TAKE HALF. I DON´T LIKE MAYONNAISE. EAT CRAP THEN. NO ONE´S HOME. THIS IS JUST GREAT. LOOK, ANGIE,  YOU´RE OVERREACTING. NO, I´M NOT. THE ONLY REASON YOU DID THIS WAS BECAUSE I WASN´T HERE  TO STOP YOU. THIS IS TOTAL BETRAYAL. YOU WANT TO TALK  ABOUT BETRAYAL? YOU SAW CELINE DION,  DIDN´T YOU? YOU KNEW I WANTED TO SEE  THAT SHOW. HOW COULD YOU?! NAME ONE OF HER SONGS. THEY´RE ALL BEAUTIFUL.  DON´T MAKE ME CHOOSE. HOW ABOUT THE ONE  SHE´S LIKE THAT, "AHH." GEORGE. WE ALWAYS CONSULT EACH OTHER BEFORE WE DO ANYTHING  WITH THE KIDS. BUT THIS TIME, YOU PARENTED  BEHIND MY BACK. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU. NOW, I´M GONNA KEEP CALLING  BENNY´S UNTIL SOMEONE´S HOME. WELL, WE GOT THE HOUSE  WITHOUT THE KIDS AND... THE FIGHT´S OVER. MAYBE NOW WOULD BE  A GOOD TIME TO, YOU KNOW... PUT UP THE SHELVES  IN MAX´S ROOM THAT YOU´VE BEEN PROMISING  TO DO FOR A YEAR? YOU SURE  THIS ISN´T JUST ABOUT YOU WANTING TO SEE ME  IN MY TOOL BELT? WA-TA. OH, LOOK.  IT´S THE ANGIESAURUS. IT NAGGED ALL THE OTHER  DINOSAURS TO DEATH. THAT´S WHY THEY´RE EXTINCT. "HOW DO I TRUST YOU AFTER THIS?" THAT´S WHAT I´M TALKING  ABOUT. YEAH. SHE´S WEARING A THONG,  ANGIE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? ON THE BACK OF THIS POSTER. MAX MADE A LIST OF THINGS  TO BLACKMAIL CARMEN WITH. "NUMBER ONE, CARMEN FAILED  HER MATH QUIZ. "NUMBER TWO, CARMEN TOOK $20  OUT OF MOM´S PURSE. NUMBER THREE, CARMEN WEARS  A THONG TO SCHOOL!" GEORGE, HOW DO WE KNOW MAX  ISN´T JUST MAKING THINGS UP? REMEMBER WHEN I SAID  THAT CARMEN´S VIRGINITY WAS HANGING ON BY A THREAD? HERE´S THE THREAD! GEORGE, CALM DOWN. WHY SHOULD I CALM DOWN? WE TOLD HER SHE COULDN´T  WEAR THONGS! AND SHE DID IT  BEHIND OUR BACKS. I´M GOING TO MY MOM´S... WELL, I TOLD YOU NO ONE´S HOME. I´LL WAIT OUT FRONT. I WANT TO SEE THE LOOK  ON HER FACE WHEN I TELL HER  SHE´S GROUNDED FOR A YEAR. YOU CAN´T DO THAT. WHY NOT? BECAUSE I GAVE HER PERMISSION  TO WEAR THE UNDERWEAR. WHAT?! WHEN?! AFTER WE DISCUSSED IT. I TOLD YOU --  YOU JUST DON´T REMEMBER. YOU NEVER LISTEN TO ME. OH, NO.  NOT THIS TIME, ANGIE. LOOK, I MIGHT NOT PAY ATTENTION  WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WORK OR FAMILY OR YOUR FEELINGS. BUT YOU SAY THE WORD  "THONG," THE REST OF THE WORLD  MELTS AWAY. LOOK, YOU´RE PARENTING  BEHIND MY BACK, AND WORSE,  YOU´RE LYING ABOUT IT. YOU CAN´T COMPARE THE TWO. WEARING A THONG AT HER AGE  ISN´T A BIG DEAL ANYMORE. IT´S A BIG DEAL TO ME. GEORGE. I WEAR THONGS. ANGIE, WHEN YOU WEAR A THONG, YOU´RE SPICING UP  A 16-YEAR-OLD MARRIAGE. WHEN CARMEN WEARS A THONG,  SHE´S STARTING A PEP RALLY IN EVERY 16-YEAR-OLD  BOY´S PANTS. THIS ISN´T ABOUT SEX. IT´S ABOUT PANTY LINES. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN BE SO RIGID  SOMETIMES. IT´S THE TREE THAT BENDS  THAT DOESN´T BREAK. YEAH? AND THERE´S THAT TREE THAT´S  BENDING OVER WEARING A THONG ´CAUSE THAT´S THE TREE  ALL THE MONKEYS ARE CLIMBING ON. ONE THING. I DID ONE THING  BEHIND YOUR BACK. AND WHAT ABOUT CARMEN´S  NEW CELLPHONE? DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT? THE PHONE IS FREE. LOOK, IT´S NO WONDER THE KIDS THINK THEY CAN DO  WHATEVER THEY WANT, BECAUSE WHEN I TELL THEM NO,  YOU GO BEHIND MY BACK, AND YOU TELL ´EM YES. WELL, I CAN´T HELP IT. THE WAY YOU WERE RAISED, YOUR FIRST INSTINCT IS  TO SAY NO AND TO PUNISH, AND THAT´S NOT ALWAYS RIGHT. NO.  WE AGREED TO BE A TEAM. IT´S US AGAINST THEM. IF WE´RE NOT UNIFIED, THEY´RE  GONNA WALK ALL OVER US. YOU´RE RIGHT.  I´M SORRY. FROM NOW ON, WE DON´T GO  BEHIND EACH OTHER´S BACKS. WE FIGHT UNTIL SOMEONE WINS. ALL RIGHT, LET´S GET IT ON. CARMEN DOESN´T WEAR A THONG,  AND YOU TAKE BACK THAT PHONE. OKAY.  THE PHONE GOES BACK, AND CARMEN GETS TO WEAR  A THONG WHEN SHE´S 16. 47. 17. 66, AND IT´S  A RETIREMENT THONG. 18, SHE SHOULD BE  OUT OF THE HOUSE, AND SHE´LL BE ABLE TO WEAR  WHATEVER SHE WANTS. FINE. IF SHE REALLY MOVES OUT  WHEN SHE´S 18, SHE CAN WEAR  PLASTIC WRAP AND A CRACKER. FOR ALL I CARE. APPARENTLY, SOME OF MY CLEANING  PRODUCTS BURN THE SKIN. OH-HOO-HOO. BENNY, WHERE ARE THE KIDS? OH, RELAX, THEY´RE FINE. WHEN I LEFT THE HOUSE,  THE BOY WAS REWIRING A LAMP, AND THE GIRL WAS SITTING  ON THE COUCH SOBBING. YOU KNOW, KID STUFF. ALL RIGHT,  LET´S GO GET ´EM. OH, HEY, MOM, LET ME  ASK YOU SOMETHING. HUH? WHAT DO YOU THINK  ABOUT A TEENAGE GIRL WEARING THONG UNDERWEAR? WELL, I USED TO THINK  IT WAS PRETTY TRASHY, BUT RANDY LIKES IT,  AND... IT´S PRETTY DAMN  COMFORTABLE. YOU´RE RIGHT.  THEY´RE NOT SEXUAL AT ALL. WHAT´S GOING ON? SIT DOWN. YEAH, SIT DOWN. WE MADE YOU DINNER. YOU GUYS COOKED FOR US? MM-HMM. WE WANTED TO SHOW HOW MUCH  WE APPRECIATE YOU GUYS. WE´RE SORRY  FOR HOW WE ACTED. OHH. HUH. SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THESE CHILDREN  HAVE LEARNED A LESSON. ALL RIGHT, MAYBE A DAY  AT YOUR MOM´S DID DO THEM SOME GOOD. ANGIE, EVERYTHING´S PERFECT.  THE KIDS MADE US DINNER. THEY LEARNED THEIR LESSON, AND CARMEN´S NOT WEARING  A THONG ANYMORE. VPL. ALL RIGHT, WE MADE YOU  YOUR FAVORITE LASAGNA. AND MOM´S FAVORITE DESSERT,  BREAD PUDDING. OH, EVERYTHING LOOKS  DELICIOUS, GUYS. OOH.  IT´S A LITTLE GARLICKY. EAT CRAP THEN. YOU EAT CRAP, TOO.
