 DAD, HAVE YOU SEEN  MR. NEEDLES? I CAN´T FIND HIM  ANYWHERE. I HAVEN´T SEEN HIM. I´M WORRIED. HE DIDN´T EAT  ANY OF THE FOOD IN HIS BOWL. POUR A LITTLE BACON FAT  IN HIS FOOD. MY MOM USED TO DO THAT  WITH MY DOG. HE´D LICK THE BOWL CLEAN. MAYBE THAT´S WHY HE DIED  WHEN HE WAS 3. I JUST FOUND MR. NEEDLES  HIDING UNDER THE COUCH. HE DOESN´T LOOK SO GOOD. YOU KNOW WHAT?

 I THINK I SHOULD  CALL THE VET. NO, NOT DR. LISPY.  EVERY TIME WE GO TO THAT GUY, HE ALWAYS FINDS SOMETHING  WRONG WITH MR. NEEDLES JUST SO HE CAN CHARGE US  A FORTUNE. GEORGE, HE´S NOT  MAKING THINGS UP. THAT DOG HAS BEEN  THROUGH A LOT WITH THE DIABETES,  THE CATARACTS, THE HEART MURMUR. HE DIDN´T HAVE A HEART MURMUR.  IT JUST SKIPPED A BEAT WHEN HE SAW THAT GIANT  THERMOMETER HEADING SOUTH. FINE. I WON´T CALL  DR. LISPY. BUT I AM TAKING THE PHONE  INTO THE OTHER ROOM FOR A COUPLE MINUTES.  I MAY TAKE THE DOG OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE LATER,

 AND THERE MAY BE A BILL  FROM THE VET. BUT YOU WON, GEORGE.  YOU WON AGAIN. DARN YOUR STRENGTH. YOU KNOW, IF YOU DON´T WANT  TO SPEND ANY MONEY, YOU CAN DO WHAT MY UNCLE DID  WHEN HE WAS SICK. ERNIE, I´M NOT GOING TO KILL  A CHICKEN TO SAVE A DOG. NO, MY OTHER UNCLE. SEE, BASICALLY, HE HAD A CYST  THE SIZE OF A GRAPEFRUIT. SO HE PRAYED FOR A MIRACLE. HE PROMISED GOD  THAT IF IT WENT AWAY, HE´D GO TO MEXICO  AND CRAWL ON HIS KNEES UP THE COBBLESTONE PATH  THAT LEADS TO THE CHURCH OF THE VIRGIN  OF GUADALUPE. A MONTH LATER,  THAT CYST WAS GONE. iVáMANOS, CYST!  [ Speaks Spanish ] HE CAN SEE MR. NEEDLES  IN HALF AN HOUR. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID,  WE DIDN´T GO TO THE VET. MY MOM JUST WAITED  TILL IT GOT DARK AND THEN WE TOOK THAT DOG  FOR A RIDE. THAT IS SO MEAN. NO, IT WASN´T. WE ALWAYS DROPPED  HIM OFF IN A GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY HAD STREET LIGHTS... ALL THE CARS WERE PAINTED  ONE COLOR... NOBODY WAS SELLING CORN. WHEN MY MOM OPENED THE DOOR,  I SHOULD´VE JUMPED OUT. ANGIE. STOP CRADLING THAT DOG  LIKE HE´S A CHILD. IF THE DOCTOR SEES THAT,  HE´S GOING TO GET US FOR AS MUCH MONEY  AS HE CAN. BUT I DO CONSIDER MR. NEEDLES  ONE OF OUR CHILDREN. THAT´S JUST ´CAUSE CARMEN  SET THE BAR SO LOW. I´M SORRY I KEPT  YOU FOLKS WAITING. AND, FRANKLY, I WISH  I HAD BETTER NEWS. HOW MUCH? STOP IT. WE´RE NOT  SHOPPING FOR A CAR. YEAH, BUT HE MIGHT BE. MR. NEEDLES HAS A TUMOR  IN HIS STOMACH. OH, MY BABY. IT´S ALREADY SHOWN SIGNS  OF SPREADING, BUT HE HAS A SLIM CHANCE  IF WE OPERATE QUICKLY. HOW MUCH? WELL, THAT DEPENDS  ON A LOT OF THINGS. BUT YOU CAN´T PUT A PRICE  ON A FAMILY MEMBER. OH, YEAH? MY SON -- 5 GRAND. MY DAUGHTER -- $2,200. MY MOM -- FREE,  IF YOU TOW HER AWAY. DR. LISPY, HOW MUCH WILL  THE OPERATION COST? AROUND $3,000. $3,000! THAT LOCO!  $3,000! ARE THERE ANY OTHER  OPTIONS? WELL, IF YOU DECIDE  AGAINST THE OPERATION, THE HUMANE THING TO DO WOULD BE  TO PUT MR. NEEDLES TO SLEEP. I´M SORRY, BABY. WHY DON´T YOU TAKE A NIGHT  TO THINK ABOUT IT? YOU CAN LEAVE HIM HERE,  AND WE´LL KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. HOW MUCH DOES  THAT COST? WELL, THAT DEPENDS  ON A LOT OF VARIABLES. IF YOU WANT HIM TO HAVE HIS  OWN ROOM, A PRIVATE NURSE... HOW MUCH?  $150. NO WAY! FOR 150 BUCKS, I CAN GET HIM A HOTEL ROOM  AND A HOT POODLE AND SEND HIM OFF  IN STYLE! [ Speaks Spanish ]...  ALL NIGHT LONG! WHAT ARE YOU  DOING TONIGHT? ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS ♫ ♫ KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ ♫ THE LOW RIDER ♫ ♫ IS A LITTLE HIGHER ♫ George: ANGIE, I DON´T  WANT THE DOG TO DIE. BUT 3 GRAND? WHAT IF ONE OF THE KIDS  GETS SICK OR HURT? YOU KNOW, CARMEN´S GOING  TO BE DRIVING NEXT YEAR. PRETTY SOON, WE´LL BE PAYING  FOR SMASHED FENDERS AND STREET SIGNS,  OLD PEOPLE, COFFEE SHOPS. "WAS I GOING THE WRONG WAY? I THOUGHT EVERYONE WAS WAVING  AT ME BECAUSE I LOOK SO GOOD." [ IMITATES TRUCK HORN ] WHEN WE TOOK THAT DOG IN,  WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,  NO MATTER WHAT. AND WE HAVE. I MEAN, WE NURSED  THAT DOG THROUGH DIABETES AND MANGE... ERUPTING TAIL ACNE... IF I HAD ALL THAT STUFF,  ANGIE, I´D BE BEGGING YOU TO BURY ME IN THE BACKYARD. IF I HAD TO DIG A HOLE  BIG ENOUGH FOR YOUR HEAD, I´D RATHER PUT IN A POOL. LOOK, ANGIE,  YOU HEARD THE VET. EVEN WITH THE OPERATION,  THERE´S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE DISEASE  HAS ALREADY SPREAD. I KNOW YOU´RE UPSET, BUT I DON´T  THINK WE HAVE A CHOICE HERE. YOU WANT ME TO TELL MAX? NO, I´LL DO IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO SAY? I DON´T KNOW. I GUESS  I COULD USE THE SPEECH I PREPARED  FOR MY MOM´S DEATH. I JUST WON´T START IT  WITH, "THE REASON I´M DRINKING  CHAMPAGNE IS BECAUSE..." HEY, BUDDY,  WHERE´S MR. NEEDLES? HE WAS GASSY, SO I PUT HIM  IN CARMEN´S ROOM. LOOK, WE GOTTA TALK. MR. NEEDLES HAS A TUMOR  IN HIS STOMACH. I´M SORRY, SON, BUT IT DOESN´T  LOOK LIKE HE´S GOING TO MAKE IT. BUT...HE´S BEEN SICK  BEFORE. HE ALWAYS GETS BETTER. NOT THIS TIME, MAX. MR. NEEDLES  IS IN A LOT OF PAIN. YOU DON´T WANT HIM  TO GO THROUGH THAT, DO YOU? NO. AND NEITHER DO WE, SO... TOMORROW, WE´RE GOING  TO TAKE HIM TO THE VET AND... END HIS SUFFERING. SO WE STILL GOT  ONE MORE NIGHT. HE MIGHT GET BETTER. I DON´T THINK  THAT´S GOING TO HAPPEN, SON. IT COULD. GOD, IF YOU SAVE MR. NEEDLES,  I´LL... I´LL BE NICE TO CARMEN  FOR A WHOLE MONTH. AREN´T YOU GOING TO PRAY? OKAY. SURE. I HOPE MR. NEEDLES  GETS BETTER, BUT I´M NOT EXPECTING  ANYTHING. DAD! I JUST DON´T WANT YOU  TO GET YOUR HOPES UP. BUT YOU HEARD ERNIE. PRAYING WORKED FOR HIS UNCLE. OKAY. [ GROANS ] AGAIN, I´M NOT  EXPECTING ANYTHING. BUT, GOD, IF YOU MAKE MR. NEEDLES  GET BETTER, I WILL CRAWL UP  THE COBBLESTONE PATH TO THAT CHURCH IN MEXICO. THANKS, DAD. OKAY. JUST REMEMBER, IF THE PRAYERS  DON´T WORK, MR. NEEDLES WILL GO  STRAIGHT TO HEAVEN, AND HE´LL BE ABLE TO RUN AGAIN  AND LIFT HIS LEG AND PEE... AND HE´LL BE THAT FEISTY  LITTLE GUY HE WAS BEFORE HE GOT NEUTERED. REALLY? YEP. EVERY TIME A BELL RINGS,  SON, ANOTHER DOG GETS BACK  HIS HUEVOS. [ BARKING ] I´M TELLING YOU,  MR. NEEDLES IS BETTER. HE´S BEEN LIKE THIS  ALL DAY. HE DID FINISH  ALL HIS FOOD THIS MORNING. LOOK, YOU TWO  ARE BREAKING MY HEART. THIS IS A VERY,  VERY SICK DOG. DOES THAT LOOK SICK  TO YOU? HE´S SO SAD, ANGIE,  HE´S KISSING HIS ASS GOODBYE. DOGS KNOW. HE KNOWS. OKAY, UH, WE TOOK  MORE X-RAYS LIKE MRS. LOPEZ  REQUESTED. LISTEN, WE CAN´T FIND  THE TUMOR. IT´S JUST... DISAPPEARED. I TOLD YOU! WHOA, WAIT, WAIT,  WAIT A MINUTE, WHAT DO YOU MEAN  "DISAPPEARED"? TAKE A LOOK FOR YOURSELF  AT THE X-RAYS. YESTERDAY, TUMOR.  TODAY... NO TUMOR. AND YOU CAN TELL  IT´S THE SAME DOG BECAUSE HE SWALLOWED  THIS HEART-SHAPED EARRING. OH, I´VE BEEN LOOKING  FOR THAT. AND I THINK YOU´LL BE  FINDING IT VERY SOON. DOCTOR, HOW DOES A TUMOR  JUST DISAPPEAR? IF I HAD TO GUESS, I´D SAY IT´S A MIRACLE. GOD HEARD US.  THE PRAYERS WORKED. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I PROMISED GOD  I´D BE NICE TO CARMEN IF HE SAVED MR. NEEDLES. DAD MADE A PROMISE, TOO. WHAT DID YOU PROMISE? HA. NOT--  NOTHING, REALLY. HE HAS TO CRAWL ON HIS KNEES  TO SOME CHURCH IN MEXICO. REALLY? WHAT ARE YOU DOING  UP THERE? YOU KNOW, IF YOU´RE LISTENING  TO ME NOW, I WANT TWO MORE WISHES. IT DOESN´T WORK  THAT WAY. WHAT DO YOU KNOW?  YOU´VE NEVER SAVED A DOG. HOW IS MR. NEEDLES? HE´S DOING GREAT. DAD, WHEN ARE YOU GOING  TO MEXICO AND GO CRAWL  ON YOUR KNEES? YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD CAME TO ME LAST NIGHT  IN A VISION. I DON´T HAVE TO GO ANYMORE. YEAH? WHAT´D HE SAY? IT WAS ALL A BIG MIX-UP. IT TURNS OUT HE WAS TRYING  TO SAVE SOME DOG IN CHINA -- MR. NOODLES. THAT IS THE LAMEST EXCUSE  I´VE EVER HEARD. WAIT TILL TOMORROW. YOU KNOW YOU CAN´T  PUT THIS OFF FOREVER. MAX IS GOING TO BUG YOU  ABOUT THIS EVERY DAY FOR THE REST  OF YOUR LIFE. ANGIE, I CAN´T GO TO MEXICO  AND CRAWL ON MY KNEES. ERNIE TOLD ME THE PATH  TO THAT CHURCH IS A MILE OF ROUGH  COBBLESTONES. WELL, YOU SHOULD´VE THOUGHT  ABOUT THAT BEFORE YOU MADE A PROMISE  TO GOD IN FRONT OF YOUR SON. I THOUGHT THE DOG  WAS ON HIS WAY OUT! AND NOW I´M BEING PUNISHED  FOR TRYING TO COMFORT MY BOY? WHAT KIND OF SICK GAME  IS THIS? IT´S NOT A GAME. WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT DOG  IS A MIRACLE. COME ON, DON´T TELL ME  YOU BELIEVE THAT. Angie: THEN YOU EXPLAIN IT. I CAN´T. I ALSO CAN´T EXPLAIN  WHY MARTIN SHEEN IS A LATINO, BUT THAT DOESN´T  MAKE SENSE, EITHER. FINE. BLOW OFF GOD,  BUT DON´T BLAME ME WHEN YOUR HANDS TURN  TO SERPENTS AND START BITING  YOUR FACE. SSS -- OW! SSS -- OW!  SSS -- OW! SSS -- OW! LOOK, ANGIE, PLEASE, IF GOD PUNISHED EVERYONE WHO  BROKE HIS PROMISE TO HIM THE WORLD WOULD BE FILLED  WITH WAR AND FAMINE. IT IS. DAD´S RIGHT. PEOPLE MAKE PROMISES  ALL THE TIME, AND THEY NEVER  FOLLOW THROUGH. JASON PROMISED TO TAKE ME  TO A MOVIE TONIGHT, THEN JUST BLEW ME OFF  AT BASKETBALL PRACTICE. BUT I COULDN´T SAY ANYTHING,  ´CAUSE IF I´M MAD AT HIM, HE MIGHT BREAK UP WITH ME,  AND ALL I WANT TO DO IS KEEP BEING  JASON McNAMARA´S GIRLFRIEND! I MIGHT GO TO MEXICO JUST TO GET THE HELL  OUT OF THE HOUSE. [ MUTTERS IN SPANISH ] IF YOU DON´T FOLLOW THROUGH  WITH THIS AND ANYTHING HAPPENS  TO MR. NEEDLES, MAX WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU. I CAN NEVER DO NOTHING  IN THIS HOUSE. THEY´RE ALL CRAZY  IN THERE. WHY DO YOU THINK  I´M OUT HERE? LET´S SEE -- SMOKE OR TALK TO ANGIE? WELL, THEY BOTH  SHORTEN MY LIFE. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE TAX ON THESE  HELPS PAY FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THIS ONE´S FOR THE KIDS. I´M NOT GOING TO GO  TO MEXICO AND CRAWL ON MY KNEES. OH, GEORGE, IT DOESN´T MATTER  IF YOU ACTUALLY GO AS LONG  AS MAX THINKS YOU WENT. MA, I´M NOT GOING  TO LIE TO HIM. WHY NOT? HE´LL NEVER FIND OUT. GEORGE, REMEMBER WHEN  YOU WERE LITTLE AND I TOOK YOU  TO DISNEYLAND? YEAH. IT WAS JUST A CARNIVAL IN A CHURCH PARKING LOT. BUT THERE WAS  DISNEY CHARACTERS THERE. NOPE, NOPE. THOSE DWARVES  YOU WERE HUGGING -- THEY WERE JUST DWARVES. I CAN´T BELIEVE  YOU DID THAT. GEORGE, COME ON. WE WERE BROKE.  I WANTED YOU TO BE HAPPY. IT WORKED, DIDN´T IT? I GUESS. WHAT ABOUT SEA WORLD  WITH THE LOBSTER TANK AND THAT REALLY GOOD  GARLIC BREAD? LET´S NOT  GO DOWN THIS ROAD. HEY, WHAT ARE  YOU DOING? I THOUGHT YOU WERE  SUPPOSED TO BE DOWN IN MEXICO. AS FAR AS MAX KNOWS,  I AM. WHAT? OH, NO. YOU´RE GOING TO FAKE  CRAWLING ON THE COBBLESTONES? THAT´S SACRILEGE. COME ON.  THIS IS HARMLESS. IT´S NOT LIKE  I´M TRICKING HIM INTO HUGGING  A BUNCH OF WASTED DWARVES. OKAY, HOW LONG  HAVE YOU BEEN HERE DRINKING? LOOK, FATHER RICK  JUST WALKED IN. GEORGE, IT´S A SIGN. HE´S JUST PICKING UP MONEY FROM  THE DONATION JAR. IT´S A SIGN. LOOK, GEORGE,  THEN WHY IS HE COMING OVER? HOW ARE YOU? I´M GOOD, MAN.  TAKE CARE. HOW´S IT GOING,  ERNESTO? GEORGE IS LYING  TO HIS SON AND GOD, AND YOU´VE BEEN SENT  DOWN HERE TO SAVE HIM. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANT  TO GET OFF YOUR CHEST, GEORGE? YOU GOT A MINUTE? SURE. LOOK, FATHER,  MY KID´S DOG WAS DYING, SO I PROMISED GOD  THAT IF HE LIVED -- HA HA -- I´D CRAWL UP  THE COBBLESTONE PATH TO THE CHURCH  OF THE VIRGIN OF GUADALUPE. I´VE HEARD THOSE COBBLESTONES  ARE LIKE JAGGED KNIVES CUTTING AWAY  AT YOUR KNEES. ANYWAY, MAN,  THE DOG GOT BETTER. NO ONE KNOWS HOW. SO NOW MY SON  WANTS ME TO GO TO MEXICO, BUT I ONLY SAID THE PRAYER  TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER. WELL, GEORGE, IN THE BIBLE,  GOD DOESN´T BARGAIN. YOU DON´T OFFER HIM THINGS  TO GET THINGS IN RETURN. THANK YOU. THAT´S PERFECT.  THAT´S WHAT I CAN TELL MAX. WHY DOES IT TAKE YOU GUYS  AN HOUR TO SAY THE SAME THING  ON SUNDAYS? THEN AGAIN,  YOU DID MAKE A PROMISE, AND IF YOU DON´T  KEEP YOUR WORD, THAT´S BEARING  FALSE WITNESS, WHICH WOULD BE  BREAKING A COMMANDMENT. BUT IT´S NOT, LIKE, ONE  OF THE BIG COMMANDMENTS, RIGHT? LIKE KILLING OR STEALING. I MEAN, COME ON,  GOD JUST KIND OF THREW THAT ONE IN  TO FILL UP THE TABLETS. I MEAN,  "THE NINE COMMANDMENTS" -- THAT SOUNDS KIND OF LAME. ULTIMATELY, GEORGE,  YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF DO YOU WANT TO BE A MAN  WHO KEEPS HIS WORD OR A LIAR? OKAY. LET´S SAY I DON´T  DO THIS COBBLESTONE THING, BUT I DO SOMETHING  JUST AS GOOD. LET´S SAY I GIVE  A LITTLE SOMETHING-SOMETHING TO THE CHURCH. LET´S SAY -- HUH?  [ Whistles ] GEORGE, IS THAT A FOUR  OR A SEVEN? THAT IS A ONE, MY MAN. HAVE A NICE TIME  IN MEXICO. OH, MAN,  THIS IS TOUGH. YOU KNOW, WE COULD WALK  A LITTLE BIT ON OUR FEET, AND NOBODY WOULD KNOW. GOD WOULD KNOW. YOU´RE ONE OF THOSE, HUH? SO WHY ARE YOU HERE? THERE WAS A HORRIBLE FLOOD. MY ENTIRE VILLAGE WAS LOST. AS I CLUTCHED  TO THE TOP OF A TREE AND THE WATERS ROSE, I PROMISED GOD  IF HE SPARED MY LIFE, I WOULD CRAWL THIS PATH. AND YOU? MY KID´S DOG GOT SICK. HERE, HONEY. AH. ANYTHING ELSE  BEFORE I GO? NO, I´M ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. I´M GOING TO GO  GET YOUR PAIN MEDICATION. I´LL BE RIGHT BACK. OKAY, I GET IT.  YOU´RE WELCOME. [ FLATULENCE ] WHAT WAS THAT? [ FLATULENCE ] OH, COME ON.  I CAN´T MOVE. GO TO CARMEN´S ROOM. NEEDLES,  GO TO CARMEN´S ROOM. GO. [ FLATULENCE ] I THINK I KNOW  WHAT KILLED THAT TUMOR.
