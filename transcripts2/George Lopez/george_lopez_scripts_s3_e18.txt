YOU DON´T NEED  A TUTOR! YOU KNOW,  HAVING A DUMB KID... NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF --  I WASN´T. [ INTRO TO WAR´S "LOW RIDER"  PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ IS THAT THE NEW TUTOR? YEP. NUMBER FIVE. LOOKS LIKE WE FINALLY  GOT A GOOD ONE. HE´S PAYING ATTENTION.  MMM. OKAY, SWEETIE,  LET´S TRY IT THIS WAY. "X" IS MY SECRET, AND YOU WANT TO FIGURE  MY SECRET OUT. SO I´M GONNA  GIVE YOU A CLUE. 2 TIMES "X" EQUALS... OH, I JUST GOT A CHILL. MAX,  YOU´RE NOT CONCENTRATING. YOU KNOW, WHEN I MAKE  MY PARENTS MAD, THEY TICKLE ME. MAX... MAX...  [ CHUCKLES ] WOW. YOU KNOW, I READ THAT WOMEN THAT ARE THAT  BEAUTIFUL DON´T HAVE BOYFRIENDS ´CAUSE GUYS ARE TOO INTIMATED  TO COME UP AND TALK TO THEM. HUH. WELL, ADD ME  TO THE LIST, MAN! HE´S ONLY PAYING ATTENTION  BECAUSE SHE´S SO PRETTY. WELL, SOMETIMES YOU NEED  AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN TO GET A MAN´S ATTENTION. YOU KNOW  WHAT I´M TALKING ABOUT -- THAT SHORT SKIRT YOU WEAR WHEN YOU WANT ME TO SEE  A JUDE LAW MOVIE. OKAY, I´LL EXPLAIN  WHY WE CAN´T BE TOGETHER IN MATHEMATICAL TERMS. YOU´RE 11, AND I´M 22. SO WHEN YOU´RE 18,  I´LL BE... IT DOESN´T MATTER.  I´LL BE 18. I THINK WE´RE DONE  WITH THIS. HI. I´M SORRY, I DON´T THINK  I´M GETTING THROUGH TO MAX. I SEEM TO HAVE A TOUGH TIME  WITH THE BOYS... AND THIS ONE GIRL  WHO LOOKS LIKE CLAY AIKEN WHO JUST STARES AT ME  AND BITES HER LIP. WELL, WE APPRECIATE  YOUR EFFORT, ASHLEY. HOW MUCH DO WE OWE YOU?

MAX, FINISH YOUR MATH  IN THE BACKYARD. AH, YOU CAN PLAY  WITH THE SCRUNCHIE WHEN YOU´RE DONE  WITH YOUR HOMEWORK. I WANT HER SMELL,  NOT YOURS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I´M GONNA FIND  ANOTHER TUTOR. GEORGE, THIS ISN´T WORKING,  AND IT´S NOT THE TUTORS. THEY´VE HELPED  OTHER DYSLEXIC KIDS. IT´S MAX. NO, IT´S NOT. LOOK, MAYBE HE´S NOT MATURE  ENOUGH TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY. I THINK IT WOULD BE  GOOD FOR HIM TO SPEND ANOTHER YEAR  IN THE FIFTH GRADE TO GROW UP. NO WAY! LOOK, THIS ISN´T ABOUT  MATURITY, ANGIE. YOU NEVER HAD  A LEARNING DISABILITY. THERE´S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY  OUT THERE WHO CAN HELP HIM. THE TEST  IS TWO WEEKS AWAY. HE´S NOT GONNA GET ALGEBRA  IN TWO WEEKS. ANGIE... [ Squealing voice ]  I GOT THIS! I WILL FIND A BETTER TUTOR --  SOMEBODY OLD SCHOOL WITH THE -- ♫ WHOOP-DI-WHOOP ♫ "OLD TEACHER WILLING  TO DISCIPLINE YOUNG STUDENT." HUH? HOW ABOUT THAT?  OH. OHH. HEY, GUYS. JASON WALKED ME HOME. IS IT OKAY  IF HE STAYS FOR DINNER? SURE, BUT I THOUGHT  YOU WERE MAD AT HIM FOR NOT SPENDING  ENOUGH TIME WITH YOU. YEAH, BUT I MADE HIM PROMISE NOT  TO TAKE ON ANY MORE ACTIVITIES. I´M HIS PRIORITY. NOW, DID HE SAY THAT, OR DID YOU SAY THAT,  AND HE JUST SAID, "UH-HUH... "UH-HUH... UH-HUH"? SO YOU HAVING TROUBLE  WITH THIS, BUDDY? YEAH. YEAH, MY BROTHER HAD TROUBLE  WITH ALGEBRA, TOO. SO WE CAME UP  WITH A LITTLE RHYME. "ALGEBRA´S CRAP. "IT´S A WASTE OF GAS. "SEE YOUR TEACHER SITTIN´  ON HER BIG FAT... "ASK ME HOW TO DO IT,  AND I´LL TELL YOU, BROTHER. "JUST DO TO ONE SIDE  WHAT YOU DO TO THE OTHER. "TAKE THE BOTTOM NUMBER.  YOU MULTIPLY. YOU SEE WHAT I´M DOIN´?  AND I´M NOT HIGH." DO TO ONE SIDE  WHAT YOU DO TO THE OTHER. "X" EQUALS 8? THAT´S IT. I GOT ONE!  I GOT ONE RIGHT! MOM, DAD,  I SOLVED A PROBLEM. JASON SHOWED ME  HOW TO DO IT. REALLY? CAN YOU TUTOR HIM? DAD! FIFTEEN BUCKS AN HOUR. BUT YOU GUYS  PAID ASHLEY $30. QUIET! YOU DON´T KNOW MATH!  GET OVER HERE. I GUESS I CAN  FIND THE TIME. NO! JASON, YOU SAID YOU WOULDN´T  TAKE ON ANY MORE ACTIVITIES. I CAN DO IT  IN A HALF-HOUR A DAY, AND WE´LL SEE  EACH OTHER MORE. COME ON, YOUR LITTLE BROTHER  NEEDS HELP IN MATH. FINE. BUT MAX WON´T NEED TO KNOW MATH  FOR HIS JOB, ANYWAY. WHEN SOMEONE  ORDERS A HAMBURGER, HE´LL JUST PRESS  THE HAMBURGER PICTURE! DID YOU HEAR THAT,  BUDDY? SHE PUT YOU RIGHT UP FRONT,  AT THE REGISTER! SOMEBODY BELIEVES IN YOU,  MI HIJO. WHAT´S THE MATTER,  MAX? WE GOT THE GRADES BACK  ON OUR PRACTICE TESTS, AND I NEED THEM SIGNED. OH, HONEY,  WE KNOW YOU TRIED HARD, AND THAT´S THE MOST  IMPORTANT THING. SAVE THAT FOR THE LOSERS  WHO SUCK IN EVERY SUBJECT. I GOT A "B" IN MATH! "D" MINUS. "D" MINUS. "D" MINUS. "B"! [ GASPS ]  THIS IS AMAZING! George: YES! NOW I KNOW WHAT  A KOREAN FATHER FEELS LIKE! WAY TO GO, MAX. LOOK, JASON,  YOU HELPED MAX IN MATH, BUT HE´S SUCKIN´  IN ALL HIS OTHER SUBJECTS. IF YOU COULD TUTOR HIM  IN ALL THOSE OTHER SUBJECTS, HE MIGHT MAKE IT  TO THE SIXTH GRADE. THEN, ONE DAY WHEN YOU´RE  RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT, YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU HELPED  A LITTLE BROWN BOY. DAD, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? CARMEN,  LET HIM ANSWER. JASON,  HELP THE LITTLE BROWN BOY. ALL RIGHT, I´LL HELP.  OH, MY GOD! I BETTER GO  TALK TO HER. OH, HEY,  JUST A LITTLE ADVICE. BEFORE SHE CRIES,  YOU CRY. THEN SAY, "I´M SORRY. I DON´T DESERVE  TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW." THEN RUN AND WIPE YOUR EYES  LIKE THAT. CARMEN... HOW CAN YOU DO  MORE TUTORING? YOU´VE ALREADY GOT  LIKE A MILLION ACTIVITIES. BASKETBALL, DEBATE,  STUDENT COUNCIL... AND EVERYTHING  IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME. IT´S NOT MORE IMPORTANT  THAN YOU. I JUST NEED ALL THAT STUFF  FOR MY TRANSCRIPT. OH, OKAY, WELL,  I´M SORRY OUR RELATIONSHIP CAN´T GET YOU  TO A BETTER COLLEGE. MAYBE YOU DON´T HAVE TIME  FOR A GIRLFRIEND. YEAH, MAYBE I DON´T.  [ GASPS ] LOOK AT THEM  FIGHTING OUT THERE. THIS IS YOUR FAULT. ONCE HE CRIES AND RUNS,  IT WILL BE FINE. THAT DOESN´T EVEN WORK  WHEN YOU DO IT. [ SNIFFS ] I KNOW. I DON´T DESERVE TO TALK  TO YOU RIGHT NOW. I´M GONNA GO PLAY GOLF. I DON´T THINK SO. EVERYTHING OKAY, HONEY?  NO! NO -- THANKS TO YOU,  JASON AND I JUST BROKE UP. I DON´T EVER WANT TO SEE HIM  IN THIS HOUSE AGAIN. OKAY,  I´LL TAKE CARE OF THIS. OH, JASON, HOLD UP MAN.  YOU CAN´T DO THIS. LOOK, MR. LOPEZ, I´M SORRY IT DIDN´T WORK OUT  BETWEEN ME AND CARMEN. OKAY, SO AM I. OKAY, CARMEN IS ONE  OF THE SWEETEST, MOST WONDERFUL GIRLS  IN THE WORLD, AND SHE DOESN´T DESERVE  ANY OF THIS. BUT I´M TALKIN´ ABOUT MAX. I DON´T WANT HIM TO FAIL, BUT  CARMEN´S NOT GONNA WANT ME HERE. LOOK, I´LL GET MY DAUGHTER  THROUGH THIS, OKAY? YOU JUST KEEP  HELPING MY BOY. I GUESS,  BUT IT´S GONNA BE AWKWARD. NOT AS AWKWARD AS DROPPING OFF  A 21-YEAR-OLD KID AT THE FIFTH GRADE! "GOOD LUCK, MAX. YOUR MOM PACKED YOU SOME PUDDING  AND A 40-OUNCE." [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] HOW YOU DOING,  SWEETHEART? I FEEL LIKE JASON  RIPPED OUT MY HEART AND STOMPED ON IT  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I´M SORRY, HONEY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU COULD DO  TO GET YOUR MIND OFF JASON? VOLUNTEER. JOIN SOME CLUBS, CARMEN. I MEAN, ANYTHING  TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE... BETWEEN 4:00 AND 6:00 MONDAY,  WEDNESDAY, AND FRIDAY, WHEN JASON WILL BE  TUTORING MAX. OKAY, PIZZA´S ON ME.  CHIN UP! WHAT DID YOU DO? LOOK, I HAD TO ASK JASON  TO KEEP TUTORING MAX, OKAY? I HAD NO CHOICE.  NO! JASON CAN´T COME BACK HERE. ALL RIGHT. I KNOW JASON IS HELPING MAX,  BUT CARMEN IS HURTING. WHY CAN´T MAX STUDY  AT JASON´S HOUSE? WHO´S GONNA TAKE HIM?  YOU WORK, AND I WORK. WHY DO WE HAVE TO GET INVOLVED  WITH JASON AT ALL? GOD, NOBODY IN THIS HOUSE  CARES HOW I FEEL! WHERE´S SHE GOING?  WE´RE IN HER ROOM. GET OUT OF MY ROOM. LOOK, I KNOW YOU HATE ME  RIGHT NOW. OKAY, BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY  BEFORE I LEAVE... ARE YOU IN ON THIS PIZZA  OR WHAT?

UH, YEAH,  YOU LOOK FAMILIAR. YEAH, I PLAY CLARINET  IN THE BAND. REMEMBER -- REMEMBER AT  HOMECOMING WHEN YOU GUYS, YOU, LIKE, RAN OFF  ONTO THE FIELD, AND YOU KNOCKED ME OVER, AND YOU  WERE, LIKE, "OH, SORRY, DUDE." AND I WAS, LIKE,  "OH, NO, IT´S COOL." AND, LIKE, IT MIGHT --  IT MIGHT -- IT MIGHT HAVE LOOKED LIKE  BACK THEN THAT I WAS CRYING, BUT I WASN´T --  I JUST HAVE ALLERGIES. IT´S GOOD TO KNOW. DON´T MIND US, WE´RE JUST GONNA  DO SOME STUDYING, TOO. COME ON. OH, WHY DON´T WE START  WITH CHEMISTRY? BECAUSE YOU AND I  HAVE SUCH GREAT CHEMISTRY.

TRYING TO GET THE TASTE OF  BRAD´S TONGUE OUT OF MY MOUTH. LOOK, WE NEED TO TALK. YOU CAN BEGIN WITH THE "MAX  IS MORE IMPORTANT" SPEECH NOW. LOOK, MAX IS MORE IMPORTANT  AT THIS MOMENT, CARMEN. OKAY, AND THERE´S TIMES THAT  YOU´RE MORE IMPORTANT THAN MAX. LOOK, IT´S NOT EASY,  BUT SOMETIMES YOUR MOTHER AND I HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT AREN´T  GOOD FOR EVERYBODY. NAME ONE TIME YOU DID  SOMETHING THAT WAS GOOD  FOR ME AND BAD FOR MAX? YOU WANT TO KNOW?  OKAY, I´LL TELL YOU. CARMEN, YOUR PRIVATE SCHOOL  COSTS SO MUCH THAT MAX ISN´T GONNA  GET A NEW BIKE, HE´S NOT GETTING A COMPUTER,  AND HE´S NEVER GETTING BRACES. I DIDN´T REALIZE  HE WAS GIVING ALL THAT UP. WELL, NEITHER DOES HE,  SO DON´T SAY NOTHING. YOU DON´T UNDERSTAND. I STILL LOVE JASON. LOVE...[ SIGHS ] CARMEN, YOU´RE NOT ALLOWED  TO USE THAT WORD. CARMEN, YOU´RE 15.

BUT MAX ISN´T GONNA MOVE ON  UNLESS HE GETS HELP FROM JASON. SO JASON HAS TO COME BACK HERE  AND TUTOR HIM, OKAY, SO GO AHEAD AND YELL. NO. I´LL GO OVER TO JASON´S HOUSE  TOMORROW AND GET HIM TO COME BACK. OH, THANK YOU. SO, YOU PROMISE ME MAX WILL  NEVER GET TO WEAR BRACES? NOT AS LONG AS I´M ALIVE.
