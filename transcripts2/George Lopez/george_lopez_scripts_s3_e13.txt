 HEY, DADDY. HEY.  WHAT´S THAT? OH, IT´S ONE OF MOM´S  LA MARIE HEADACHE MASKS. YEAH? SO THAT STUFF  GETS RID OF HEADACHES? LET´S SEE IF IT WORKS. NO, THE PAIN´S  STILL THERE. WELL, I GOT MY OWN  HEADACHE MEDICINE. [ SNAPS ] IT´S ALSO GOOD FOR  ARTHRITIS AND DEPRESSION... POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS -- WAKING UP IN A FIELD WITH  YOUR PANTIES ON YOUR HEAD.

WHAT DO YOU THINK  HE DID? OH, ANGIE,  DOES IT MATTER? I´M SAILIN´ ON A  COOL WAVE OF LAVENDER! I DON´T EVEN  HAVE ANY KIDS! GEORGE,  THIS IS SERIOUS. OR A WIFE. HI, MOM. GUYS, WAIT OUTSIDE FOR A MINUTE.  WE NEED TO TALK TO MAX.

 OH, IT´S OKAY, GUYS. IF IT´S WHAT HAPPENED  AT SCHOOL, THEY ALREADY KNOW. IT WAS JUST A JOKE. MAX...WHAT DID YOU DO? I STUCK A PENCIL UP MY NOSE.  HERE... OOH! MAX!  KETCHUP? OH, YEAH. SWEET! YOU DID THAT IN CLASS? YEAH. MISS REYNOLDS FREAKED OUT  AND FELL BACK ON THE GLOBE. DID YOU KNOW TWO-THIRDS  OF THE EARTH IS COVERED  BY MISS REYNOLDS´ BUTT? WE DO NOT  HIGH-FIVE BAD BEHAVIOR. WE SHOULD BE  HIGH-FIVING GOOD DEEDS. LIKE TODAY -- I HELPED AN OLD MAN TO HIS CAR  AT THE GROCERY STORE, HUH? GEORGE...  I DON´T GET IT -- DO YOU SQUEEZE IT  FROM THE BOTTOM OR DO YOU USE THE PENCIL  AND PUSH IT OUT? MAYBE YOU SHOULD WAIT OUTSIDE.  I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR DAD. I DON´T LIKE  WHAT´S HAPPENING WITH MAX. HE´S GETTING  A REAL MOUTH ON HIM, AND NOW HE´S STARTING  TO ACT OUT. COME ON, ANGIE,  HE´S JUST BEING A BOY. WHEN I WAS HIS AGE, I PULLED  ALL KINDS OF STUPID PRANKS. [ CHUCKLES ] ONE TIME, I HID A DEAD SHRIMP  IN THE LINING OF ERNIE´S JACKET. THAT´S NOT FUNNY. IT´S NOT FUNNY WHEN YOUR FRIEND IS RUNNING  THE BASES IN KICKBALL, AND ALL THE CATS  ARE CHASING HIM, AND EVERYBODY IN THE SCHOOL  IS YELLING "GO, STINKY, GO!"? [ LAUGHS ] THAT´S NOT FUNNY? I DON´T KNOW  WHO I MARRIED. HEY, HEY, HEY. WHY DON´T YOU THREE  GO PLAY IN THE FRONT? IT´S MY YARD.  I CAN PLAY HERE IF I WANT. OKAY, OKAY...HERE. WHY DON´T WE PLAY  A NEW GAME? IT´S CALLED "GET THE BALL  FROM THE NEIGHBOR´S ROTTWEILER." YOU KNOW,  I GOT A BETTER IDEA. WHY DON´T YOU TAKE  YOUR TIRED ASS HOME? MAX, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? BENNY! ANGIE, I GOT IT. COME ON, HONEY,  LET´S GO INSIDE. HEY, YOU DON´T HIT MAX! GEORGE, YOU DIDN´T HEAR  WHAT HE SAID TO ME. HE TOLD ME TO TAKE  MY TIRED...BUTT HOME. HE´S LUCKY  I DIDN´T HAVE A POOL CUE. I´LL DEAL WITH HIM LATER. OKAY, BUT YOU DON´T  HIT MY SON EVER! WHAT´S WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT, NOW THAT  I´M GROWN UP YOU NEED SOMEBODY ELSE  TO SMACK AROUND? PLEASE -- I NEVER HIT YOU. WHAT?! YOU USED TO  HIT ME ALL THE TIME. AT THE CLOTHES FOR LESS, YOU USED TO PULL ME IN  THE DRESSING ROOM AND HIT ME SO THE CAMERAS  WOULDN´T SEE. COME ON, LET´S GO INSIDE. [ Imitating Benny ]  IT DIDN´T FIT. ALL RIGHT, SO I SMACKED YOU  A FEW TIMES. YOU TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT. "YOU TURNED OUT ALL RIGHT."  THAT´S YOUR ANSWER? LOOK, MY HEAD WAS NEVER  SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BIG. THIS IS ALL SWELLING! GEORGE, YOU´RE LUCKY. YOU DON´T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I  WANTED TO HIT YOU, AND I DIDN´T. YOU KNOW, I SAID  I WOULD NEVER HIT A WOMAN. YOU GET ONE MORE HAIR ON THAT  CHIN, AND I´M TAKING YOU DOWN. GET OUT! [ INTRO TO WAR´S "LOW RIDER"  PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ OH, ANGIE, I´M SO SORRY I MISSED  THE MEETING WITH MAX´S TEACHER, BUT WE GOT CAUGHT UP WITH  THIS BIG FUSELAGE, TURBINE, ADAPTOR...THING. RIGHT, ERNIE? UH, YEAH. UH, BASICALLY, THERE WAS  AN EXPLOSION AND A FIRE, AND I WAS TRAPPED  UNDERNEATH MY MACHINE, AND GEORGE  PULLED ME OUT BY MY FEET. AND THAT´S WHY  WE´RE LATE. I KNEW YOU´D TRY  TO GET OUT OF THIS, SO I TOLD YOU  THE WRONG TIME ON PURPOSE. MAX´S TEACHER  SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE. YOU LIED TO ME? WELL, I THINK I´M TOO UPSET  TO GO TO THE MEETING NOW. HEY, HEY... YOUR MOTHER´S HERE. SHE BETTER BE COMING  TO APOLOGIZE TO MAX. ARE YOU KIDDING? WHEN I WAS SIX, SHE HIT ME  WITH THE CAR IN THE DRIVEWAY AND NEVER APOLOGIZED. SHE RAN YOU OVER, AND  SHE DIDN´T SAY SHE WAS SORRY? NOPE. SHE JUST CRACKED THE WINDOW  AND SAID "WHY YOU CRYING? "YOU KNOW WHERE  I PARK THE CAR. WALK RIGHT, SHOW OFF!" AND I WAS LIKE... [ LAUGHS ]  NOW, I REMEMBER THAT. THERE WAS A BIG DENT IN THE CAR  WITH BLACK HAIR IN IT, AND SHE TOLD THE WHOLE  NEIGHBORHOOD SHE HIT A BEAR. ARE YOU HERE  TO APOLOGIZE TO MAX? I CAME OVER TO FIND OUT WHEN MY SON´S GONNA STOP  ACTING LIKE A BIG BABY AND LET ME BACK  IN THE CAR POOL. RIGHT NOW.  MY CAR´S IN THE GARAGE. WHY DON´T YOU GO START IT,  MOM, AND WAIT FOR ME? YOU KNOW WHAT? MAX SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING  TO ME FOR WHAT HE SAID. HE WILL, BECAUSE  GEORGE AND I TALKED TO HIM. AND WE TOOK AWAY TV  FOR A MONTH. WOW. A MONTH WITHOUT  THE STUPID TALKING SPONGE -- THAT´S GONNA HURT! YOU DON´T HIT MY KID. YOU KNOW, I JUST GAVE HIM  A LITTLE SMACK. IT´S NOT LIKE I´M  THE ONLY ONE IN THE WORLD. TRUST ME -- NOBODY IS GIVING  THEIR KID A TIME-OUT IN CHINA. WELL, ACTUALLY,  CHILDREN IN CHINA ARE A LOT MORE RESPECTFUL  OF THEIR ELDERS, SO A TIME-OUT  WOULD PROBABLY WORK. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THEY HAVE  MORE THAN ONE INFANT GIRL, THEY SMOTHER THEM. SO YOU GOT  YOUR GOOD AND YOUR BAD. THANKS FOR THE BEER,  GEORGE. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA  WHAT YOU DID TO MAX? LOOK, ANGIE, FORGET IT.  YOU´RE WASTING YOUR TIME. NO! YOU HUMILIATED HIM  IN FRONT OF HIS FRIENDS, AND WORSE, YOU HIT HIM  IN HIS IDENTITY. NO, I AM PRETTY SURE  THAT´S ABOUT TWO FEET LOWER. NO. THIS -- THIS IS WHO  YOU ARE IN THE WORLD -- HOW YOU CONNECT  TO EVERYONE AROUND YOU. AND WHEN YOU HIT  A CHILD HERE, IT´S LIKE YOU´RE  HITTING WHO HE IS. I DIDN´T KNOW THAT. LOOK... YOU MADE MY IDENTITY  ALL SAD. GET OUT, MOM. AND DON´T COME BACK TILL  YOU´RE READY TO APOLOGIZE. MOM, DAD,  MAX´S TEACHER´S HERE. ALL RIGHT, YOU´RE NEVER  GONNA SEE ME AGAIN. OH, NO,  I´LL SEE YOU AGAIN. I´M SURE ONE DAY I´LL GET  A CALL FROM THE MORGUE TO COME BY  AND IDENTIFY YOU. THAT´S HER...SHE´S COLD. WHY DON´T WE WRAP HER AROUND  THE KEG AND START THIS PARTY? [ POUNDING ON WINDOW ] MRS. REYNOLDS, YOU REMEMBER  MY HUSBAND GEORGE? ACTUALLY, I DON´T THINK I´VE  EVER SEEN YOU AT SCHOOL BEFORE. I DIDN´T EVEN KNOW YOU  WERE MARRIED, ANGIE. COME ON, YOU DON´T REMEMBER ME  AT ALL THOSE SCHOOL PLAYS? BACK ROW, THIRD SEAT  FROM THE AISLE? MAYBE THIS WILL HELP... [ SNORING ] DID WE SCORE? NOW YOU SEE WHERE MY SON  GETS HIS SENSE OF HUMOR. AH. MRS. REYNOLDS,  WE´RE REALLY SORRY ABOUT WHAT MAX DID  WITH THE PENCIL UP HIS NOSE. THANK YOU FOR THAT,  BUT THERE IS A BIGGER PROBLEM THAN THE FACT THAT THE CHILDREN  NOW CALL ME "EARTH BUTT." [ LAUGHS ] THAT´S NOT FUNNY.  IT´S HURTFUL. MAX HAS BEEN ACTING OUT TO  GET HIS CLASSMATES´ ATTENTION, AND I THINK THAT  HE´S DOING THIS BECAUSE HE´S FALLING  SO FAR BEHIND ACADEMICALLY. FALLING BEHIND ACADEMICALLY?  ¿ESTáS LOCA? HEY! WE KNOW MAX HAS GOTTEN  A FEW BAD GRADES, BUT HE IS STILL STRUGGLING  WITH HIS DYSLEXIA. IT´S NOT JUST  A COUPLE OF BAD GRADES. I MEAN, HE´S TURNING IN  BLANK PAGES. HE´S NOT EVEN TRYING. RIGHT NOW, MAX IS AT  THE BOTTOM OF MY CLASS. WELL, IF HE SLIPPED  SO FAR BEHIND, WHY DID YOU WAIT SO LONG  TO TALK TO US? I DIDN´T --  I SENT HOME A NOTE. HE BROUGHT IT BACK SIGNED. I NEVER SIGNED A NOTE. NOR DID I. IT´S MRS. LOPEZ´S  SIGNATURE. OH, THANK GOD.  LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I DON´T BELIEVE THIS.  HE FORGED IT! I´M WORRIED THAT MAX´S BEHAVIOR  IS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE, SO I THINK WHAT HE  NEEDS TO DO IS TO SIGN THIS  SCHOOL-WORK CONTRACT. IT SAYS THAT HE´LL DO  HIS WORK, AND IF HE DOESN´T, IT SPELLS OUT  THE CONSEQUENCES. "MAY RETAIN"? WAIT, WAIT...  YOU MIGHT FLUNK HIM? NO, DON´T THINK OF IT  THAT WAY. THINK OF IT AS  A YEAR-LONG OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE MATERIAL. YEAH, HE MIGHT FLUNK. WELL, THAT´S  NOT GONNA HAPPEN. WE´LL WORK WITH MAX EVERY  NIGHT IF THAT´S WHAT IT TAKES. THAT´S RIGHT. HE´S NOT  GONNA FAIL THE FIFTH GRADE. NO ONE IN MY FAMILY HAS EVER  FAILED THE FIFTH GRADE. IF THIS WAS THE SIXTH GRADE  OR THE SEVENTH... OR A SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT, WE´D BE HAVING  A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. BUT THIS IS THE FIFTH GRADE,  DAMN IT, AND THIS IS WHERE  THE LOPEZES SHINE. AND IF YOU DON´T BELIEVE ME,  SABES QUé, RED HAIR? I´LL TAKE THAT --  GEORGE! MAX, GET DOWN HERE! NOW IT MAKES SENSE WHY MAX  WAS ACTING THIS WAY -- WHY HE MOUTHED OFF  TO BENNY. HOW DID I NOT  SEE THIS COMING? MAYBE I WAS  WORKING TOO MUCH. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN  ON TOP OF THIS. WELL, I´M GLAD YOU SAID THAT,  ´CAUSE COMING FROM ME, THAT MIGHT HAVE  SOUNDED UGLY. MAX, WHAT´S THIS? IT´S A PIECE OF PAPER  WITH MOM´S SIGNATURE. OH, NO! I´M FALLING BEHIND  ACADEMICALLY! WHY DIDN´T YOU SHOW ME  THIS NOTE? CUT THE CRAP. WE JUST MET  WITH MRS. REYNOLDS, AND SHE SAID YOU´RE BEHIND  IN ALL YOUR SCHOOLWORK, AND THAT  YOU´RE NOT EVEN TRYING. MAX, IF YOUR GRADES  DON´T IMPROVE, THEY´RE GONNA  HOLD YOU BACK A YEAR. SO? YOU´LL LOSE  ALL YOUR FRIENDS. THEY´LL ALL MOVE ON. I WON´T LOSE MY FRIENDS.  THEY THINK I´M FUNNY. WELL THEN, YOU SHOULD KEEP  FAILING AND FAILING, BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT´S  REALLY HILARIOUS? AN 80-YEAR-OLD FIFTH GRADER  TRYING TO PLAY HIDE-AND-SEEK. LOOK... THIS IS A CONTRACT  FROM YOUR TEACHER. IT SAYS YOU PROMISE TO WORK HARD  FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR, AND WE WANT YOU  TO SIGN IT. BUT I DON´T  CARE ABOUT SCHOOL. I SHOULDN´T EVEN  HAVE TO GO. DON´T WALK AWAY  FROM ME. YOU ARE GOING TO  SIGN THIS CONTRACT, AND THEN YOU´RE GONNA  START DOING YOUR HOMEWORK. WHAT´S THE POINT?  IT´S TOO HARD! WHAT´S THE POINT?  WH -- LET ME HANDLE THIS. LOOK... I KNOW SCHOOL´S HARD,  BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO GO. WHY? BECAUSE WHAT KIND OF JOB  ARE YOU GONNA GET IF YOU DON´T GO TO SCHOOL? I COULD BE  A PRO SKATEBOARDER. REALLY? ´CAUSE I DON´T SEE A LOT OF PRO  SKATERS COMING INTO THE HOUSE SAYING "MOMMY, MY ELBOW --  KISS IT!" OKAY... BUT I COULD STILL WORK  AT A SKATE SHOP. SO YOU MAKE A COUPLE  HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH. A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS?  THAT´S AWESOME! I MEAN, I COULD GET  A COOL CAR, A BIG HOUSE... YOU CAN´T GET A CAR  AND A HOUSE ON YOUR SALARY. I MEAN, YOU COULD IF YOU MOVED  INTO A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD. THEN I´LL LIVE  IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD. OOH, BUT THEY JUST  STOLE YOUR CAR. NO WAY. YOU COULD  RUN AFTER ´EM. YEAH, I´LL GET IT BACK. OOH, MAN,  YOU JUST GOT SHOT. DAD, I KNOW WHAT YOUR DOING,  BUT YOU´RE NOT GONNA TRICK ME. I´M NEVER GONNA  BE GOOD AT SCHOOL. I´M JUST STUPID! LOOK -- YOU ARE  NOT STUPID! YOU HAVE  A LEARNING DISABILITY. LOOK -- I KNOW  WHAT YOU´RE GOING THROUGH. WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL, I REMEMBER TAKING TESTS  AND JUST SITTING THERE, BECAUSE I DIDN´T  UNDERSTAND ANY OF IT. AND I HAD TO WORK TWICE  AS HARD AS THE OTHER KIDS JUST TO GET BY. AND I COULD HAVE DROPPED OUT,  BUT I DIDN´T. BECAUSE NO ONE IN OUR FAMILY HAD  EVER GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL, AND I WANTED  TO BE THE FIRST ONE. AND I WAS! GEE...SO IF I WORK HARD  AND GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL, I CAN GET SOME LOSER JOB  AT A FACTORY LIKE YOU? YOU KNOW WHAT?  I DON´T CARE. ALL RIGHT,  DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. I GIVE UP ON YOU. HEY, MAX.  GOT A MINUTE? PEOPLE KNOW I´M OUT HERE. LISTEN, IF YOU HADN´T MOUTHED  OFF, I WOULDN´T HAVE HIT YOU. WELL, THAT´S THE WAY  I WAS RAISED, OKAY? THINGS  WERE DIFFERENT THEN. WHAT WE CALLED "DISCIPLINE"  IS NOW CHILD ABUSE. KEEPING AN EYE ON YOUR MAN...  IS NOW STALKING. HELL, BACK THEN,  "NO" MEANT "YES." WELL, AT LEAST IT DID  TO ME. [ LAUGHS ] OKAY, NEVER MIND. I GUESS WHAT  I´M TRYING TO SAY IS... HERE´S A 20 --  ARE WE COOL? YEAH, WE´RE COOL.  I´M SORRY FOR WHAT I SAID. AH, FORGET IT.  WE ALL SAY STUPID THINGS. HEY, GRANDMA? YEAH? DID YOUR DAD EVER SAY  HE GAVE UP ON YOU? WHERE´D THAT COME FROM? I´M MESSING UP IN SCHOOL, AND  DAD SAID HE´S GIVING UP ON ME. WOW. YOU KNOW, MY DAD MIGHT HAVE  BEAT ME LIKE AN OLD BLANKET, BUT HE NEVER  GAVE UP ON ME. THAT IS COLD, DUDE. YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT  TO GET YOUR CRAP TOGETHER. Angie: GEORGE! YOU GOTTA SEE THIS. YEAH, I KNOW. THE SKY IS PINK,  ORANGE, AND RED. IT´S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL  SUNSET EVER. I LOVE YOU, TOO.  I´M WATCHING A HOCKEY FIGHT. IT´S MAX. WHAT NOW? COME ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MY HOMEWORK. YEAH? I´M NOT GONNA BE  HELD BACK. DON´T GIVE UP ON ME. OH, MAN. LOOK, MAX,  I´M SORRY I SAID THAT. OKAY, I WAS ANGRY. I´D NEVER GIVE UP  ON YOU, SON. I BELIEVE IN YOU.  I HAVE FAITH IN YOU. NOW SIGN THIS  LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT. YOU KNOW, I STILL HATE SCHOOL,  BUT I´M NOT GONNA LET YOU DOWN. WE´RE NOT GONNA  LET YOU DOWN, EITHER. ´CAUSE A FAMILY´S ONLY  AS SMART AS ITS DUMBEST CHILD, SO LET´S MAKE THAT  CARMEN AGAIN. HEY! QUIET!  I´M TEACHING HERE. AND WE´RE GONNA HELP YOU OUT,  ´CAUSE IF YOU FAIL, WE FAIL. I´M GONNA  CHANGE MY SCHEDULE. I´LL WORK WITH YOU AFTER SCHOOL  ON MONDAYS AND TUESDAYS. AND WEDNESDAYS, I CAN BLOW OFF  HAPPY HOUR AT THIRSTY´S AND COME STRAIGHT HOME  TO HELP. YOU GO TO HAPPY HOUR  AT THIRSTY´S? IF YOU´RE GONNA USE THAT TONE,  YOU´RE DAMN RIGHT I DON´T! WHAT ARE YOU  DOING HERE, MOM? OH, RELAX. WE´RE A BIG,  HAPPY FAMILY AGAIN. MAX AND I ARE FINE. DID SHE APOLOGIZE  TO YOU? NO. BUT SHE GAVE ME  20 REASONS TO GET OVER IT. YOU JUST PAID HIM OFF? YEP. YOU CAN´T DO THAT!  YOU CAN´T JUST BUY FAMILY. ALL THOSE CELEBRITY  LESBIANS DO IT. OKAY, IF YOU PAY HIM  $20 A HIT, YOU MUST OWE ME,  LIKE, $600,000. SHUT YOUR BIG, FAT  IDENTITY HOLE. I ACCIDENTALLY THREW OUT YOUR  FAVORITE RAIDERS JERSEY. I´LL GET ANOTHER ONE. MY MOM´S HAVING  HER HOUSE TENTED, SO SHE MIGHT HAVE TO  STAY WITH US FOR A WEEK. I´LL BUY MORE BEER. REMEMBER THAT TIME  WE WENT TO THE LAKE, AND IT RAINED THE WHOLE WEEKEND,  AND WE STAYED IN THE ROOM? [ Seductively ]  YEAH? I LOST THAT VIDEO WE MADE. WHAT?! TIME FOR  A NEW MASK, BABY. AHH!
