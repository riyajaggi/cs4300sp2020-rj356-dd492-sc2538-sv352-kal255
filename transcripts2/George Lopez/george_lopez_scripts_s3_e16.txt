 George interferes with Benny and Randy's relationship, causing Randy to break up with Benny. Benny starts to mope around so George goes to have a talk with Randy.

THEN WE´RE GOING TO  A GREAT SEAFOOD RESTAURANT THAT ANGIE RECOMMENDED. DON´T WORRY, I CALLED AHEAD.  THEY HAVE CHICKEN. AND THEN, AFTER TOOTHPICKS, I´VE GOT A LITTLE ANNIVERSARY  PRESENT FOR YOU. WHAT IS IT? NOT HERE, BENNY. WHEN I GIVE IT TO YOU,  I WANT THE MOOD TO BE RIGHT. WELL, WAIT.  LET ME GET A EMPTY JUG, AND I´LL TOOT YOU OUT  SOME COURTIN´ MUSIC. LET´S JUST CUT OUT THE ROMANCE  AND JUST GIVE IT TO ME. H-HANG ON, BABE.  LET´S DO THIS RIGHT. [ WHIMPERS ] I LOVE YOU. WHAT´S THIS? IT´S THE KEY  TO MY APARTMENT. METAPHORICALLY, IT´S THE KEY  TO MY HEART. I THINK IT´S TIME WE TAKE THINGS TO THE NEXT  LEVEL, BENITA! THE NEXT LEVEL, HUH? WELL, IT WAS BOUND  TO HAPPEN SOONER OR LATER. UM, I´LL TELL YOU WHAT. I´M JUST GONNA GO SHIMMY  INTO THIS LITTLE NUMBER, AND THEN, YOU KNOW,  WE CAN JUST HEAD OUT. THIS IS SO EXCITING! I CAN´T WAIT TO SEE HER  IN A DRESS! [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ TIRES SCREECH ] THAT WAS HORRIBLE. SHE DOESN´T  DESERVE YOU, RANDY. WHY WOULD SHE  DO THAT, GEORGE? WAIT. WE DON´T EVEN KNOW  IF THAT WAS HER. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN  THE NEIGHBOR´S CAR. I´M GONNA GO CHECK. MOTHER?! I´M SURE  THIS´LL ALL WORK OUT, HUH? [ ENGINE TURNS OVER ] [ TIRES SCREECH ] [ INTRO TO WAR´S "LOW RIDER"  PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ HEY, WHY AREN´T YOU  ON THE FLOOR? OH, UM, I MET A GIRL  AT THIRSTY´S LAST NIGHT, AND I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN HER  THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD MY OWN OFFICE  WITH MY OWN PHONE LINE, SO... GO TO WORK, AND I´LL GET YOU  WHEN SHE CALLS. WELL, YOU CAN´T ANSWER  THE PHONE "POWERS BROTHERS AVIATION." WHY NOT? WELL, I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN  HER THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS AN INSURANCE  ADJUSTER. THAT´S YOUR LIE  TO GET WOMEN? WHAT? "PROFESSOR OF LOVEMAKING"  DOESN´T WORK ANYMORE? YOU CAN´T SIT HERE ALL DAY.  GO BACK TO WORK. I TOLD HER TO CALL BEFORE  LUNCH, SO, YOU KNOW. OH, OKAY. [ LIFTS RECEIVER,  DIALS TELEPHONE ] [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HELLO?  BIG INSURANCE COMPANY. GET BACK TO WORK! HEY, WHERE WERE YOU  LAST NIGHT? I CALLED, LIKE, 20 TIMES.  THEN I CAME OVER. DIDN´T YOU HEAR ME POUNDING  ON THE DOOR? YOU KNOW MY CREDIT. SOMEBODY´S ALWAYS POUNDING  ON MY DOOR. BENNY, HOW COULD YOU  WALK OUT ON ME? I OPENED MYSELF UP  TO YOU. I GAVE YOU MY KEY. AND I THREW IT  IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. WELL, I HAD TO GET RID OF SOME USED MOTOR OIL  AND PAINT ANYWAY. WHY ARE YOU PUSHING ME  AWAY? WHY ARE YOU TRYING  TO RUIN WHAT WE HAD? WE WERE DOING REALLY GOOD BEFORE YOU WANTED TO TAKE IT  TO THE NEXT LEVEL. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? MORE THAN I´M GETTING. WHY CAN´T I SPEND  THE NIGHT FOR ONCE? WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO KICK  ME OUT RIGHT AFTER WE... HAVE RELATIONS? I´M TIRED OF HEARING, "NICE WORK, PAL, BUT  I WATCH THE NEWS ALONE." I SHOULDN´T HAVE TO  SAY IT IF YOU WOULD LEARN TO GET  DRESSED IN THE DARK. WHEN MY CIGARETTE GOES OUT,  THEN YOU SHOULD, TOO. BENNY, WE´RE GONNA DEAL  WITH THIS. NO, I´M DONE DEALING  WITH IT. WELL, I´M NOT DONE. YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU ARE DONE, BECAUSE WHEN I SAY YOU´RE DONE,  THAT´S WHEN YOU´RE DONE. IF I´M DONE, THEN WHY  AM I STILL TALKING?! MA, RANDY,  IN MY OFFICE NOW! QUE TE VOY A PEGAR. I WARNED YOU TWO ABOUT BRINGING  YOUR FORBIDDEN LOVE INTO WORK. WHEN YOU PUNCH IN,  YOU´RE NOT MY MOM, AND YOU´RE NOT THE  WRINKLE-CHASER DATING HER. YOU´RE EMPLOYEES,  SO ACT LIKE IT. AND, MOM, BRING BACK  MY CD PLAYER. THAT´S NOT PART OF THIS, BUT MAX  SAID HE SAW IT AT YOUR HOUSE. I CAME HERE TO WORK TODAY. HE IS THE ONE WHO STARTED  THIS FIGHT, OKAY? HE IS THE ONLY MAN  IN THE WORLD WHO´S NOT HAPPY THAT HE CAN  JUST HIT IT AND QUIT IT. [ DOOR SLAMS ] LISTEN, I´M SORRY  ABOUT ALL THIS, GEORGE. I´M JUST A PASSIONATE MAN. WHEN I´M AROUND YOUR MOM,  MY 1/16th APACHE COMES OUT. LOOK, RANDY, I DON´T KNOW  WHAT YOU WANT WITH MY MOM, BUT I´M GONNA TELL YOU  ONE THING -- YOU´RE NOT GONNA GET WARMTH  AND AFFECTION. I WANTED IT, TOO, WHEN I WAS  A KID, AND I DIDN´T GET IT. SHE´S COLD, MAN. SHE USED TO TAKE MY TEMPERATURE  THE OTHER WAY JUST ´CAUSE SHE THOUGHT  IT WAS FUNNY. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,  GEORGE? SHE IS WHO SHE IS, MAN. YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT  OR YOU´RE WASTING YOUR TIME. I HEAR YOU, GEORGE. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] POWERS BROTHERS AVIATION. CAR AND HOUSE INSURANCE. YEAH, ERNIE´S HERE, BUT LOOK, ERNIE´S REALLY NOT  AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER, OKAY? THE TRUTH IS HE´S A MACHINIST,  AND HE MAKES A GOOD SALARY. HE´S A GOOD GUY, AND HE LIVES  WITH HIS PARENTS, SO HE MAKES ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR A FOSTER KID  WITH AN ALCOHOLIC MOM, AND -- HELLO? WHAT THE HELL  DID YOU SAY TO RANDY? WHAT´S YOUR PROBLEM NOW? HE JUST DUMPED ME. WHAT? DON´T YOU ACT  ALL SURPRISED. IF YOU HADN´T OPENED  YOUR BIG MOUTH, HE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OVER THAT "TAKE IT TO  THE NEXT LEVEL" CRAP, AND WE WOULD HAVE GONE  BACK TO THE WAY WE WERE. THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. OH, YEAH, YOU´RE RIGHT. THIS IS MY FAULT! I´M THE ONE WHO SLEEPS WITH A  MAN YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE HIS SON AND THEN FREAKS OUT WHEN  HE DOES SOMETHING WRONG! YEAH, THAT´S ME! ALL I WANNA DO IS SLEEP  WITH BEEFY, YOUNG GUYS AND THEN THROW THEM AWAY! THAT´S RIGHT, BRAD,  WALK AWAY. THIS FUR IS PRETTY,  BUT THIS KITTY´S GOT CLAWS. LET´S MOVE ON  TO HAIR CARE, HMM? NOW, I NEED SOMEONE  TO HELP DEMONSTRATE THE NEW LA MARIE  LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER. WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU, MAX? IS THAT THE JUNK  THAT BURNED MY SCALP? HE´S REFERRING TO  THE INVIGORATING TINGLING THAT LETS YOU KNOW  THAT IT´S WORKING. ´CAUSE, LADIES, BEAUTIFUL HAIR  IS WHAT KEEPS YOUR MAN HAPPY. SORRY, LADIES. WE HAVE A HOMELESS PROBLEM  IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND SOMETIMES  THEY JUST WANDER IN. COME ON, SIR, I´LL GET YOU  A WARM BOWL OF SOUP. ...FRONT YARD.  I´M SORRY. MOM, WHAT DO YOU THINK  YOU´RE DOING? ANGIE´S GOT CUSTOMERS  OUT THERE. WHAT IS GOING ON? AND WHY ARE YOU WALKING  AROUND IN A ROBE? BECAUSE I GOT NO ONE  TO GET DRESSED FOR. I GOT NO ONE  TO GET UNDRESSED FOR. GEORGE SCREWED UP MY  RELATIONSHIP WITH RANDY. GEORGE, WHAT DID YOU DO? I TOLD HIM HE HAS TO ACCEPT  MY MOM THE WAY SHE IS. WHAT A HORRIBLE THING  TO SAY! HE NEVER WANTED ME TO DATE, AND NOW HE´S MADE SURE  I WON´T. COME ON, MOM.  THERE´LL BE OTHER GUYS. THERE´S A COUPLE BILLION  ON THE PLANET. THERE´S GOTTA BE TWO  WITH THE SAME FETISH. EVEN IF I DID MEET  ANOTHER GUY, YOU WOULD JUST SCREW IT UP. I´M DONE.  HMM. BY THE WAY, I BROUGHT  YOUR CD PLAYER BACK. IT´S BEEN SKIPPING. YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK  INTO THAT. GEORGE, I CAN´T BELIEVE  YOU DID THAT. I´VE NEVER SEEN YOUR MOM  THIS DEPRESSED. WHAT´S EVERYBODY GOING  SO CRAZY ABOUT? WHAT´S THE BIG DEAL  ABOUT LOSING RANDY? HE GAVE MY MOM AN STD. HE DRINKS LIKE A FISH, AND HALF OF HIS RELATIVES  ARE IN PRISON. GEORGE, THAT´S A CATCH  FOR HER. LOOK, RANDY  MAY NOT BE PERFECT, BUT HE´S SWEET AS CAN BE. OH, HE´S GOT YOU FOOLED,  TOO? I´M TELLING YOU, ANGIE.  SOMETHING´S NOT RIGHT. MY MOM ABUSES HIM,  AND HE STAYS WITH HER. I´LL TELL YOU WHY. HE´S GONNA MARRY HER, PUT A BIG INSURANCE POLICY  ON HER HEAD, AND LET THE CIGARETTES  DO THEIR WORK. WHAT IF HE REALLY  LOVES HER? "WHAT IF HE REALLY  LOVES HER?" ¿ESTáS LOCA? WHAT IF HE REALLY  LOVES HER? WELL, THEN, I WAS WRONG, AND I RUINED THE REMAINDER  OF MY MOM´S LIFE. SO? SO, YOU BETTER BE DAMN SURE  YOU´RE RIGHT ABOUT RANDY. OH, AND HERE´S  ANOTHER THING. IF SHE´S ALONE  IN HER OLD AGE, SHE´S GONNA END UP LIVING HERE IN THIS HOUSE  FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. AND YOUR NEXT WIFE  IS NOT GONNA LIKE THAT. SALMA WOULDN´T MIND. SALMA SAID EXTENDED FAMILY  IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HER. SALMA? SALMA HAYEK... MY SECOND WIFE. I´LL WALK IN WITH HAIR  LIKE THIS AND... [ YELLS IN SPANISH ] I´M GEORGE HAYEK. THAT´S RIGHT.  YOU DON´T KNOW. SHE COULD LOVE ME. HEY, RANDY,  YOU GOT A MINUTE? SURE. I WAS JUST SHARING A LITTLE  MISERY WITH SHELLY HERE. TEQUILA. SO, WHAT´S UP, GEORGE? LOOK, I KNOW YOU AND MY MOM  BROKE UP, ALL RIGHT? BUT I CAN´T TAKE THE CHANCE OF YOU TWO GUYS FIGHTING  ON THE FACTORY FLOOR AGAIN. I TRIED TO KEEP MY PERSONAL  FEELINGS OUT OF THIS, BUT I COULDN´T. SO I´M GONNA FIRE  MY MOM LATER. WHAT? ARE YOU CRAZY? BENNY´S BEEN THERE  OVER 35 YEARS. IF YOU GOTTA FIRE SOMEBODY,  FIRE ME. LOOK, I CAN´T AFFORD  TO LOSE YOU, RANDY. AND GINA´S GONNA DO  MY MOM´S WORK. HEY, WHAT ABOUT GINA, HUH? SHE´S EVEN OLDER  THAN MY MOM. NICE CONDO AT THE MARINA,  BRAND-NEW TITANIUM HIPS. LOOK, BENNY  DOESN´T DESERVE THIS. IF YOU DON´T WANT  TO FIRE ME, I QUIT. SO YOU´D ACTUALLY QUIT  FOR HER? I JUST DID. I WOULD DO ANYTHING  FOR THAT WOMAN, GEORGE. I LOVE HER SO MUCH. IF I COULD, I´D LOCK HER  IN A CAGE AND SHOW HER OFF... LIKE AN EXOTIC BIRD THAT NO  HUMAN HAND SHOULD EVER SOIL. HEY, RANDY, IF I HELP YOU  GET HER BACK, DO YOU PROMISE ME THAT YOU  WILL LOCK HER IN A CAGE? WAIT A MINUTE.  YOU´RE NOT FIRING HER? I WAS JUST MAKING SURE  YOU WERE FOR REAL. OKAY? I´M SORRY. RANDY, YOUR EX  JUST WALKED IN. ALL RIGHT, JUST LET ME  TAKE CARE OF THIS. I WANT HIM  OUT OF THIS BAR. THIS IS MY BAR! EVERYTHING CAN´T ALWAYS  BE YOUR WAY, BENNY! LOOK, HE´S GOT JUST AS MUCH  RIGHT TO BE HERE AS YOU DO, MOM. NO! GEORGE, THIS IS WHERE I COME  TO FORGET MY PROBLEMS. I DON´T WANT TO SEE HIM  HERE. I´VE BEEN COMING HERE  SINCE HE WAS IN DIAPERS, SINCE YOU WERE IN DIAPERS. I EVEN CHANGED YOUR DIAPERS  ON THIS POOL TABLE. I USED TO POWDER YOUR BUTT  WITH THE BLUE CHALK. EVERY STORY  MAKES ME CLOSER TO YOU. THIS GUY REALLY CARES  ABOUT YOU, MOM. YOU´RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE.  YOU´RE BLOWING THIS. YOU KNOW, GEORGE, HE´S THE ONE WHO GAVE UP  HIS GOOD THING, OKAY? HE KNOWS WHERE TO FIND IT  IF HE WANTS IT. LOOK, MOM,  HE´S NOT GONNA DO THAT. YOU GOTTA GIVE HIM  SOMETHING. SHOW HIM THAT YOU CARE. WELL, MAYBE I DON´T CARE. OH, YOU DON´T CARE? SO IF SHELLY´S BEEN HITTING  ON HIM FOR THE LAST HOUR, AND HE´S GONNA TAKE HER OUT  ON SATURDAY NIGHT, THAT WOULDN´T BOTHER YOU? BIG DEAL. I NEED A SMOKE. RANDY, I THINK I´M GETTING  THROUGH TO HER. SO OPEN UP THAT CAGE DOOR  AND SOIL YOURSELF. YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU WERE  SAYING WITH THE... WHAT ARE YOU DOING  TO RANDY´S TRUCK? WARMING UP  FOR RANDY´S HEAD! HOW COULD HE DO THIS TO ME?!  WE JUST BROKE UP! I THOUGHT YOU DIDN´T CARE  ABOUT HIM. I DON´T! RANDY´S NOT GOING OUT  WITH SHELLY. I JUST MADE THAT UP! WHAT?! LOOK, I WANTED TO PROVE  SOMETHING. YOU WOULDN´T BE GOING CRAZY  LIKE THIS IF YOU DIDN´T CARE  ABOUT HIM. GET OVER HERE. I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW  MUCH I CARE ABOUT YOU. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BEAT UP  ON THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT? I´LL TELL YOU WHY. ´CAUSE I´M GONNA GET THEM  BEFORE THEY GET ME. SO, WHAT, YOU THINK RANDY´S  GONNA BE LIKE MY DAD WAS? YOU THINK HE´S GONNA RUN  OUT ON YOU AND TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP? SOONER OR LATER,  THAT´S WHAT THEY ALL DO. SO, YOU KNOW WHAT?  WHAT IF YOU´RE WRONG? WHAT IF HE´S JUST  A GOOD GUY? THEN I DON´T KNOW. MY TRUCK!  WHAT HAPPENED?! SHE THOUGHT YOU WERE  FLIRTING WITH SHELLY. SHE´S CRAZY. YOU DESTROYED MY TRUCK, YOU CRAZY, PINT-SIZED,  MEXICAN GROUNDHOG? YOU DO LOVE ME. YEAH, I WAS GONNA SMASH UP  YOUR WINDSHIELD, AND GEORGE WOULDN´T LET ME. MARRY ME. DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHE´S STILL GOT  THE TIRE IRON. OKAY. OKAY WHAT? OKAY, I´LL MARRY YOU. WHAT? OOH! GEORGE, YOU FINALLY GOT  YOURSELF A REAL DAD! RANDY, I´M NOT READY  TO TAKE IT TO THIS LEVEL. DO WE REALLY HAVE TO GO OUT  TO DINNER WITH THEM? GEORGE, THIS IS HUGE.  YOUR MOM JUST GOT ENGAGED. WE SHOULD CELEBRATE. EVENING, GEORGE. RANDY. OH, YOU LOOK SO HANDSOME. DOESN´T HE, GEORGE? WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS. IS BENNY HERE? OH, YEAH. SHE´S UPSTAIRS  GETTING CHANGED. SHE´LL JUST BE A MINUTE. SO, JUNIOR... ORALE. OH, MY GOD. YOU KNOW WHAT?  UM... WE´RE GONNA GIVE YOU GUYS  A MINUTE. WE´LL JUST BE  IN THE LIVING ROOM. CHILDREN!
