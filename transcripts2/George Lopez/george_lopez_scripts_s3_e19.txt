THE MONEY´S  FOR A GOOD CAUSE. LET´S GO. LET´S GO. ANGIE. WE´RE NEVER GOING  TO MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO SHOW UP  THESE RICH PEOPLE. WELL, MAYBE IT´S BECAUSE  NOBODY KNOWS YOU. USUALLY THEY GET TO DUNK  SOMEBODY THAT THEY DON´T LIKE, LIKE THE PRINCIPAL OR THE MATH TEACHER  OR SOMEBODY. WELL, IT´S HARD FOR ME  TO BE UNLIKABLE, BUT I´LL GIVE IT  A SHOT. YO, "DAWSON´S CREEK"! COME ON, SPEND SOME  OF THAT TRUST FUND MONEY ON SOMETHING  OTHER THAN HAIR GEL. BUY A BALL. COME ON, JASON.  DUNK HIM. YEAH, JASON,  TAKE A SHOT. MAYBE IT´LL  GET THINGS STARTED, HUH?

YOU´RE THE YANKEE  CENTER FIELDER! 6-TIME ALL-STAR,  GOLD GLOVE, BUT YOU KNOW  WHAT THEY SAY, KENNY -- THAT ARM -- HA HA --  IT AIN´T WHAT IT USED TO BE. HANG ON. LET ME  GET YOUR CUTOFF MAN. ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU DID IT ONCE,  BUT... CONSISTENCY´S  NOT YOUR STRONG SUIT, OR ELSE THEY WOULDN´T HAVE  TRADED YOU SIX TIMES. WHOOP. I´D LIKE 100 BALLS,  PLEASE. [ SPEAKS SPANISH ] OH, THAT WAS CLOSE. HERE, WHY DON´T YOU  GIVE IT ANOTHER TRY, HUH? ANGIE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING  IN THE TANK?  COVERING FOR YOU. YOU SAID YOU WERE  JUST GOING TO THE BATHROOM. THAT WAS  HALF AN HOUR AGO. THERE WAS A LONG LINE. CHURRO? AAH! YOU ARE SO LUCKY  I DIDN´T GET DUNKED. SWEETIE, WHY DON´T YOU  SAVE THAT LAST BALL, AND THEN WHEN  MR. LOPEZ COMES, THEN -- IT´S ALL RIGHT.  SHE´S CUBAN. SHE´LL BE IN MIAMI  IN TWO DAYS. HA HA HA. MR. LOPEZ? YEAH? I´M DR. STOLLER. I´M THE PRINCIPAL  HERE AT ALLENDALE. MAY I HAVE  A WORD WITH YOU? OF COURSE YOU MAY. MR. LOPEZ, I BELIEVE  YOU KNOW LAWRENCE BAXTER. DID YOU MAKE COMMENTS CONCERNING  THIS YOUNG MAN´S WEIGHT? THIS YOUNG MAN  RIGHT HERE? NO. THERE WERE WITNESSES, MAN. I WAS TRYING  TO GET PEOPLE IN THE BOOTH. HE TOOK IT  THE WRONG WAY. DID YOU SAY HE HAS THE HARDEST-WORKING COLON  IN HIGH SCHOOL? WELL, WHEN YOU SAY IT,  IT SOUNDS KIND OF MEAN. DR. STOLLER. HI.  HOW´S THE FUNDRAISER GOING? SHE WAS STANDING  RIGHT THERE. ASK HER. LAWRENCE, CHILL. MRS. LOPEZ, DID YOU HEAR  THE DISPARAGING REMARKS YOUR HUSBAND MADE  ABOUT LAWRENCE? NO, I-I ONLY HEARD HIM  SAY "GOOD JOB, SON. THAT´LL HELP RAISE MONEY  FOR OUR HANDICAPPED FRIENDS." YOU KNOW,  DID YOU KNOW MY HUSBAND WAS  A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER? IT´S TOO LATE, ANGIE.  [ Speaks Spanish ] WHAT? HE SAID  THE BIG CRYBABY SCREWED HIM. I USED TO TEACH SPANISH. I´LL JUST APOLOGIZE TO HIM.  HE´S RIGHT THERE. I´M AFRAID  IT´S TOO LATE FOR THAT. YOU SEE, WE HAVE  A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY HERE FOR VERBAL ABUSE, AND THAT APPLIES  TO THE PARENTS AS WELL. YOU NEED TO WRITE  A LETTER OF APOLOGY. WE WILL PUBLISH IT  IN THE SCHOOL PAPER. BUT UNTIL THAT TIME, I´M AFRAID YOU´RE GOING  TO HAVE TO LEAVE THE CAMPUS. SO YOU´RE  THROWING ME OUT? HONEY, DON´T MAKE A SCENE. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY  I MADE FOR THIS FUNDRAISER? I BET IF I WAS  ONE OF THESE RICH PARENTS, I BET IF I HAD DONATED  A LIBRARY OR A SCIENCE LAB, I COULD DO WHATEVER I WANT,  I COULD SAY WHATEVER I WANT. HEY, THURSTON,  DIDN´T YOU GET THE E-MAIL? STUPID HAT DAY  IS TOMORROW. COME ON, ANGIE. STOP MAKING A SCENE.  WRAP YOURSELF. STOP IT. HEY, HONEY. HEY. ARE YOU WRITING  YOUR APOLOGY LETTER? YES. HOW´S THIS? DEAR LAWRENCE,  THIS IS AN APOLOGY. DO NOT EAT THIS LETTER. JUST WRITE  A REAL APOLOGY. I DON´T WANT PRINCIPAL STOLLER  TO BE MAD AT ME. I HAVE TO FACE HER EVERY TIME I VOLUNTEER  AT THE SCHOOL LIBRARY. YOU KNOW, ANGIE,  WHEN I WAS A KID, I GOT MADE FUN OF  ALL THE TIME, AND NOBODY EVER TOLD ME  THEY WERE SORRY. MY SCIENCE TEACHER  NEVER APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING, "KIDS, TODAY I´M GOING  TO TEACH YOU ABOUT AN ECLIPSE. LOPEZ, PUT YOUR HEAD  IN FRONT OF THE SUN." AND THEN IT GOT DARK, AND NOBODY COULD SEE  MY TEARS WELLING UP. HONEY. I LOVE YOUR BIG HEAD. LOOK, IT HAS  ITS OWN GRAVITATIONAL PULL. TODAY WAS THE WORST DAY  OF MY LIFE. LET ME GUESS -- I MADE FUN OF SOME KIDS,  SO TODAY THEY MADE FUN OF YOU. BUT, HONEY,  ISN´T IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY WERE JUST GOING  TO MAKE FUN OF YOU ANYWAY? NO. LOOK WHAT´S POSTED  ON THE SCHOOL´S WEB SITE. ALL RIGHT, SOME KID  PUT A PICTURE OF A HOT CHICK IN A WET T-SHIRT  THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE -- ANGIE! THAT´S ME  GETTING OUT OF THE DUNK TANK. YOU COULD SEE  RIGHT THROUGH MY SHIRT. WHO DID THIS? I DON´T KNOW, BUT EVERY KID IN SCHOOL  HAS SEEN IT. WELL, NOBODY DOES THIS  TO MY WIFE. SOMEBODY´S GOING  TO PAY FOR THIS. HA HA HA. OOH, YEAH. I KNOW A LOT OF GUYS  WHO´LL PAY FOR THAT. IF I WANTED PEOPLE TO SEE  PICTURES OF MY WIFE LIKE THAT, I WOULD HAVE  MARRIED A PLAYMATE. YEAH. THAT´S WHAT STOPPED YOU. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] HEY, JASON. HEY, CARMEN.  HEY, MR. LOPEZ. HEY. MRS. LOPEZ. JASON, IT´S OKAY.  YOU CAN LOOK AT ME. I DIDN´T SEE  THE PICTURE. THEN WHY CAN´T YOU  LOOK AT ME? OKAY, I SAW IT. BUT ONLY BECAUSE  ONE OF THE GUYS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM  MADE IT INTO A LIFE-SIZE POSTER AND PUT IT UP  IN THE SHOWER. THAT´S IT.  I´M GOING DOWN TO THAT SCHOOL, AND I´M GOING  TO BUST SOME HEADS. WHOSE HEADS? WE DON´T EVEN KNOW  WHO´S RESPONSIBLE. ACTUALLY, THAT´S WHY  I CAME OVER. YOU KNOW THAT BIG KID  MR. LOPEZ WAS MAKING FUN OF? MY BROTHER SAW HIM  AT THE DUNK TANK WITH A CAMERA PHONE. LAWRENCE. ANGIE, I´M GOING  TO GET THAT DIRECTORY, AND I´M GOING  TO TAKE CARE OF LAWRENCE. YOU´RE NOT GOING  TO DO ANYTHING. YOU´VE DONE ENOUGH.  I WILL HANDLE THIS. BUT, BABY, I GOT THIS. YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT, BUT YOU NEVER HAVE IT. EVER. SOMETIMES I HAVE IT. I JUST DON´T ALWAYS  BRAG ABOUT IT. AND SOMETIMES  I JUST HAVE IT. YOU JUST CLICK ONCE AND DRAG IT  WHEREVER YOU WANT. IT´S REALLY EASY TO PUT A HEAD  ON SOMEONE ELSE´S BODY. MM-HMM. OH, SEE HERE? MICHAEL JACKSON  DANGLING CARMEN FROM A BALCONY. ALL RIGHT, THAT´S GREAT, MAN.  SCOOT OVER. HEY, ERNIE, YOU GOT  LAWRENCE´S PICTURE FROM CARMEN´S YEARBOOK? WHAT ARE YOU GOING  TO DO, DAD? OKAY, WATCH THIS. ALL RIGHT,  SEE THE MAMA PIG SUCKLING HER  10 LITTLE PIGLETS? THERE´S LAWRENCE  SUCKLING 10 LITTLE PIGLETS. HA HA HA HA HA! OH, HEY, PUT HIS HEAD  ON THE PICTURE OF THOSE TWO PIGS  PLAYING LEAPFROG -- THE ONE WHERE IT SAYS  "MAKIN´ BACON." THEY´RE NOT PLAYING  LEAPFROG, MAX. THOSE PIGS ARE -- AY! OKAY. HERE´S 5 BUCKS, OKAY?  YOU WERE NEVER HERE. LET´S GO  TO THE ALLENDALE WEB SITE AND POST THIS, ´CAUSE YOU DON´T MESS  WITH GEORGE LOPEZ´S LADY, BECAUSE I´M HARD  LIKE THAT. THAT´S RIGHT.  THAT´S WHAT I´M TALKING ABOUT. NOBODY MESSES WITH US.  WE´RE LIKE -- Angie: ANYBODY HOME? SEND IT! SEND IT QUICK!  HIT RETURN -- RIGHT THERE! SO HOW DID IT GO  AT SCHOOL? I MET WITH THE PRINCIPAL, AND SHE´S GOING  TO TALK TO LAWRENCE. AND TOMORROW, I´M GOING  TO WORK AT THE LIBRARY LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED. I´M NOT GOING TO LET  SOME STUPID TEENAGE PRANK CHANGE MY LIFE. GOOD FOR YOU. THANK YOU  FOR NOT INTERFERING. I HAD TO DO THIS  MY WAY. YOU´RE RIGHT, BABY. LOOK, YOU HAVE YOUR WAY,  AND I HAVE MINE, OKAY? IF WE BOTH RESPECT THAT,  I´LL NEVER HAVE TO SLEEP ON THE WEIGHT BENCH  IN THE GARAGE. HEY, MRS. LOPEZ. ANY BETTER TODAY, HONEY? WELL, UM... DURING  THE MORNING ASSEMBLY, THE PRINCIPAL  POINTED AT ME AND TOLD EVERYONE TO STOP  MAKING FUN OF CARMEN LOPEZ. THAT HELPED. I´LL GO UPSTAIRS  AND TALK TO HER. OH, THANK GOD.  I THOUGHT IT WAS MY TURN. IT IS YOUR TURN. YEAH, BUT YOU´RE ALREADY  RIGHT THERE BY THE STAIRS, SO JUST GO. MAYBE WE SHOULD GO. YEAH, I DON´T THINK CARMEN´S  IN THE MOOD TO HANG OUT. PEOPLE WERE GIVING HER CRAP  ABOUT THAT PICTURE ALL DAY. YEAH, WELL,  DON´T WORRY. THEY´LL BE TALKING ABOUT  ANOTHER PICTURE TOMORROW. CHECK THIS OUT. I JUST POSTED THIS  ON THE SCHOOL´S WEB SITE. OOH. HEY, THAT´S LAWRENCE. HE´S NURSING PIGLETS. WHO KNEW HE WAS  SUCH A NURTURING MOTHER? MR. LOPEZ,  THAT´S KIND OF HARSH. THE GUY JUST MADE  ONE MISTAKE. ONE MISTAKE? DID YOU SEE  WHAT HE DID TO MRS. LOPEZ? LET HIM SUFFER. I MEAN HE ALREADY GETS TEASED  A LOT BECAUSE OF HIS WEIGHT. WELL, HE SHOULD HAVE  THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BEFORE HE TOOK  THAT PICTURE. BUT WE´RE NOT REALLY SURE  HE DID IT. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU SAW HIM  WITH A CAMERA PHONE. WELL, I DID,  BUT THAT DOESN´T MEAN ANYTHING. A LOT OF PEOPLE  HAVE CAMERA PHONES. LOOK, I JUST SENT OUT PICTURES  OF THIS KID AS A PIG BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU SAID. I DIDN´T KNOW  YOU WERE GOING TO DO THAT. I WOULDN´T HAVE  SAID ANYTHING. DO YOU HAVE  A CAMERA PHONE, ERIC? I THINK  I LEFT THE VAN RAMP DOWN. NOT SO FAST, IRONSIDE! WHAT´S GOING ON, ERIC? I TOOK THE PICTURE. I´M REALLY, REALLY SORRY. YOU LITTLE -- OKAY, FAIR FIGHT. ROLL INTO THIS! WHAT IS GOING ON? IT WAS HIM, ANGIE.  ERIC TOOK THAT PICTURE OF YOU. WHAT? WHY WOULD YOU  DO THAT? I DON´T KNOW.  I THOUGHT IT´D BE FUNNY. I´M REALLY SORRY,  MRS. LOPEZ. I FEEL TERRIBLE. WELL... AS LONG AS YOU UNDERSTAND  WHAT YOU´VE DONE IS WRONG, I GUESS... WE CAN LET THIS GO. MRS. LOPEZ, IF YOU DON´T TREAT HIM  LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE, YOU´RE NOT DOING HIM  ANY FAVORS. YOU DROOLING  LITTLE WEASEL! I WORKED THAT STUPID BOOTH  ALL DAY TO HELP RAISE MONEY  TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER, AND THIS IS  HOW YOU PAY ME BACK? I HAVE HALF A MIND TO TIE YOUR HANDS  BEHIND YOUR BACK AND PUSH YOU  INTO A POOL. THAT WOULD KILL HIM. WELL, TOMORROW MORNING, I AM TAKING YOU  TO THE PRINCIPAL. I WOULDN´T BE SURPRISED  IF YOU GOT SUSPENDED. CAN WE GO  IN THE AFTERNOON? I HAVE NEUROMUSCULAR THERAPY  IN THE MORNING. WELL... LET´S JUST FORGET  THIS EVER HAPPENED, HUH? THANK YOU.  IT WAS JUST A DUMB PRANK. I NEVER EXPECTED  ALL THOSE KIDS TO TEASE CARMEN. OH, AND THAT PICTURE OF LAWRENCE  MR. LOPEZ PUT ON THE INTERNET -- AHEM. WHAT PICTURE? LET´S REMEMBER WHO  THE REAL VILLAIN IS HERE -- THE KID IN THE WHEELCHAIR. WHAT PICTURE? ANGIE... THERE IS  NO MORE NOBLE ACTION THAN TO DEFEND  THE HONOR AND VIRTUE OF THE WOMAN  THAT YOU LOVE. I PUT THE BOY´S HEAD  ON A PICTURE OF A... MOTHER PIG OFFERING  ONE OF HER MANY MILK NOZZLES TO HER YOUNG. I DARE YOU  TO FIND FAULT WITH THAT. TO THE WEIGHT BENCH. GEORGE,  LAWRENCE IS HERE. OH, ANGIE,  DO I HAVE TO? YES, YOU DO. ALL RIGHT,  BUT IF YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU DON´T SEE ME,  AND THERE´S A BIG LUMP IN LAWRENCE´S THROAT,  CALL THE COPS. YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? YES, I DID. LISTEN, LAWRENCE, I WAS WAY OUT OF LINE,  OKAY? AND WHAT I DID  WAS INSENSITIVE, AND I WANTED  TO CALL YOU OVER HERE TO TELL YOU I´M SORRY, AND TO GIVE YOU A... AUTOGRAPHED PICTURE  OF KENNY LOFTON. AND... AND... A PICTURE OF -- HEY -- MICHAEL JACKSON  DANGLING ME OVER THE BALCONY. HA HA. I LOOK SCARED,  BUT I´M NOT. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT? A VERY HEARTFELT  "I´M SORRY," AND GOODBYE. YOUR WIFE SAYS  YOU HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL TO GIVE ME  FOR WHAT YOU DID. WHAT ARE YOU,  HOLDING BACK? MY WIFE SAID THAT? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. HERE ARE TWO... COURTSIDE LAKER TICKETS I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY.  ARE WE COOL? WOW, MR. LOPEZ.  THANKS, MAN. HEY, MAN, IF YOU CAN´T FIND  ANYBODY TO GO WITH YOU -- YEAH, YEAH, MAN.  WE CAN HAVE HOT DOGS, POPCORN, COTTON CANDY,  EVERYTHING, RIGHT? WELL, TOO BAD, ´CAUSE BIG "L"  DON´T ROLL LIKE THAT. PEACE OUT, BROTHER.
