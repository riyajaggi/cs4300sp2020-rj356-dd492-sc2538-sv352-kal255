 [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] MAX, TIME FOR BREAKFAST. WHAT HAPPENED IN HERE? WHAT DID YOU DO  TO YOUR PILLOW? IT KEPT ME FROM SLEEPING,  SO I PUNCHED IT. AND THEN I HIT IT  WITH MY BAT, AND I RIPPED IT APART  WITH MY TEETH. OKAY. THAT´S... PERFECTLY NORMAL, SON. ANGIE, YOU WANT TO GET IN HERE  AND BRING A CRUCIFIX?! MAX!

 WHY DID YOU DO THIS? I CAN´T SLEEP. I HAVEN´T BEEN  ABLE TO FOR A WEEK. WHY DIDN´T YOU TELL US? WELL, I ALREADY HAVE  DYSLEXIA AND DYSCALCULIA. THE LAST THING  I NEED TO FIND OUT IS THAT I HAVE  DYSSLEEPIA. IT´S CALLED "INSOMNIA." I KNEW THERE´D  BE A WORD FOR IT. THERE´S A WORD FOR EVERYTHING  THAT´S WRONG WITH ME! HONEY, THERE´S NOTHING  WRONG WITH YOU. I´M IN SPECIAL ED, I STUDY THREE TIMES HARDER  THAN ANYONE ELSE, AND I STILL MIGHT  FLUNK THE 5th GRADE.

 OH, YEAH, I´M A WINNER. LOOK, YOU´RE UNDER  A LOT OF PRESSURE. WHAT DO YOU SAY WE TAKE  THE DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL AND I BRING YOUR BREAKFAST  UP HERE, HMM? THANKS. GOOD.  OKAY, NOW, YOU REST. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,  YOU´LL FALL ASLEEP, AND EVERYTHING  WILL BE ALL RIGHT. BE GONE! NIGHTY-NIGHT. AN 11-YEAR-OLD SHOULD  NOT BE AWAKE ALL NIGHT. UGH -- BE GONE! AND STAYING  AWAKE ALL NIGHT´S NOT GONNA HELP HIM  PASS THE 5th GRADE. HEY, DADDY. HI, ANGIE, MY ANGEL. HELLO, BENITA,  MY LITTLE DEVIL. HELLO, GEORGE, MY -- YEAH, THERE YOU ARE. HEY, VIC, YOU KNOW,  THEY SELL BACON IN THE STORES, AND, WOW, YOU CAN EVEN COOK IT  AT YOUR OWN HOUSE. GEORGE, MAYBE HE NEEDS  A PSYCHOLOGIST. HE´S NOT CRAZY, ANGIE,  HE´S JUST OLD AND LONELY, AND TOO CHEAP  TO BUY HIS OWN BREAKFAST. I´M TALKING ABOUT MAX. WHAT´S WRONG WITH MAX? DADDY, HE´S SO STRESSED OUT  ABOUT SCHOOL, HE RIPPED UP  HIS PILLOW LAST NIGHT. DOES YOUR HOSPITAL HAVE  ANY GOOD CHILD PSYCHOLOGISTS? PSYCHOLOGISTS?  NO WAY. LOOK, ANGIE,  WE´RE LOPEZES, AND WE DON´T GO FOR HELP UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE  IT´S TOO LATE. DADDY, YOU´RE A DOCTOR.  HELP ME OUT HERE. THERAPY´S FOR THE WEAK. CASTRO STOLE MY ISLAND, AND A WEB DESIGNER  STOLE MY WIFE. BUT DO YOU SEE ME  CRYING LIKE A BABY TO SOMEONE WHO THINKS  THAT SMOKING A CIGAR IS A SIGN OF LATENT  HOMOSEXUALITY? SOMETIMES A CIGAR  IS JUST A CIGAR -- UNLESS IT´S A DOMINICAN  OR A HONDURAN. THOSE ARE SPECIFICALLY GROWN  FOR HOMOSEXUALS. FINALLY,  THE VOICE OF REASON. OKAY, IF YOU  DON´T LIKE THERAPY, THERE ARE OTHER WAYS  TO DEAL WITH STRESS. MAYBE IF MAX COULD  DO SOMETHING CREATIVE, IT COULD TAKE HIS MIND  OFF HIS PROBLEMS AND HELP HIM SLEEP. WHAT ABOUT AN ART CLASS? WHAT?  HOW IS ART GONNA HELP HIM GET RID  OF HIS FRUSTRATIONS? [ French accent ]  OH, I AM SO ANGRY. I WILL PAINT A LIVELY  FRENCH CAFE SCENE. AH HA HA HA! OKAY, LOOK,  I´M GONNA TAKE HIS BREAKFAST UP. WE CAN FIGURE  THIS OUT LATER. I´LL TELL YOU  HOW I GET RID OF MY STRESS. I BURN IT OFF  AT THE GYM, AND THEN  I GET A SPRAY TAN. DOESN´T HURT MY SKIN,  AND I LOOK FANTASTIC. SO YOU´RE ORANGE  DOWNSTAIRS, TOO? MOM! OYE, CHICO, I GOT IT --  BOXING. BOXING? WHEN I WAS A BOY  IN CUBA, I SUFFERED  FROM THE ANXIETY, SO MY FATHER  TAUGHT ME HOW TO BOX. I FORGOT ABOUT MY PROBLEMS,  AND I GOT STRONGER. I COULD FACE ANY OPPONENT  ON THE ISLAND WITHOUT FEAR. YEAH,  THEN CASTRO SHOWED UP, YOU HID YOUR WATCH  IN YOUR BUTT, AND YOU PADDLED TO MIAMI. YES, BUT I WAS  SO TOUGH FROM BOXING, NO MAN DARED  TAKE THAT WATCH FROM ME. OOH, VIC,  YOUR SHOE´S UNTIED. OH, YEAH? LOOK AT THAT.  I´M LATE FOR WORK. LOOK, VIC, BOXING IS A GOOD WAY  TO BLOW OFF STEAM, BUT ANGIE WOULD  NEVER GO FOR IT. SHE´D BE TOO WORRIED  THAT MAX IS GONNA GET HURT. HOW CAN HE GET HURT,  GEORGE? HE´S HALF MEXICAN  AND HALF CUBAN. HE WAS BORN TO FIGHT! AND LIVE AT HOME  UNTIL HE´S 40. LISTEN, ANGIE DOESN´T  HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT THIS UNTIL WE SEE IF MAX  LIKES BOXING OR NOT, HMM? IN THE MEANTIME, WE´LL SAY HE´S  TAKING ART CLASSES. NO. LOOK,  I PROMISED ANGIE I WASN´T GONNA GO  BEHIND HER BACK ANYMORE. I CAN´T LIE TO HER. WHAT IF I LIE  AND YOU NOD VIGOROUSLY? I CAN DO THAT. NOW I´M REALLY WORRIED --  MAX WANTS TO KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY PILLOWCASES  THAT TASTE BETTER. ANGIE,  I´VE MADE A DECISION. TELL HER, VIC. MAX IS TAKING  ART CLASSES. REALLY? ALL RIGHT. FOR ONCE YOU´RE ADMITTING  I HAD A GOOD IDEA. ADMIT IT, GEORGE. [ INTRO TO WAR´S  "LOW RIDER" PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ COME ON, MAX!  THROW SOME COMBINATIONS, HUH? HEY,  HOW´S OUR BOY DOING? HE´S HAVING A GREAT TIME,  AND HE´S SLEEPING LIKE A BABY. WOW, LOOK AT HIM GO. TWO WEEKS IN THE GYM AND MY GRANDSON  IS ALREADY A KILLER. WELL, I GUESS TOUGHNESS  SKIPS A GENERATION, HUH, PRINCESS? I COULD HAVE BEEN  A GOOD BOXER. YOU JUST NEVER ENCOURAGED ME,  OR FED ME. THAT´S NOT TRUE. WHO GETS STRONG  ON POWDERED MILK? LOOKING GOOD, KID. YOU MIGHT WANT  TO KEEP YOUR CHIN DOWN. SORRY, I DON´T TAKE  BOXING ADVICE FROM GIRLS. WELL, LISTEN,  IF YOU´RE GONNA TRAIN IN MY GYM, YOU´RE GONNA  HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME. MAX, THIS IS LAILA ALI. [ Imitating Muhammad Ali ]  THIS IS MUHAMMAD ALI´S DAUGHTER. SHE´S THE GREATEST FEMALE  FIGHTER OF ALL TIMES, MAN, AND SHE´S SO PRETTY. YEAH?  WELL, CAN YOU DO THIS? WATCH OUT. LET ME TRY. NO, HE BELIEVES YOU. IS IT OVER?! YOU KNOW,  YOU´RE A COCKY LITTLE KID. WE OUGHT TO SEE  WHAT YOU CAN DO IN THE RING. WELL, HE´S ONLY BEEN HITTING  THE BAG FOR A COUPLE WEEKS, AND HIS MOM DOESN´T EVEN  KNOW THAT HE´S DOING THIS. THAT´S OKAY.  THEY´LL HAVE ON HEADGEAR. THEY´LL JUST SPAR A LITTLE.  LET´S GIVE IT A TRY. ALL RIGHT. I´M DR. VICTOR PALMERO, WELTERWEIGHT CHAMPION OF SEÑORA de la MADRID´S  SCHOOL FOR BOYS IN 1956, ´57, AND ´59. CARDIOLOGIST, PUGILIST, AVAILABLE. I´M MARRIED. CONGRATULATIONS.  PERHAPS YOU SHOULD WEAR A RING. HEY, JOEY,  GIVE MAX HERE A ROUND. HE´S PRETTY QUICK. WE HAVE AN OPEN TOURNAMENT  COMING UP IN A COUPLE WEEKS. YOU MIGHT WANT  TO SIGN HIM UP. WHOA! WAY TO GO, DUDE!  THAT´S MY BOY! I´M SO PROUD OF YOU, MAX!  YOU´RE A REAL FIGHTER, MAN! DID YOU SEE ME?!  I PUT HIM DOWN! I´M THE MAN!  OH! OOH! UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD  PUT A CUP ON HIM BEFORE HE TAKES  HIS SHOES OFF. ALL RIGHT, SHE´S NOT HERE.  COME ON. OKAY, LET´S SEE. OH, MAN,  IT´S GETTING WORSE. A BLACK EYE IS SOMETHING  TO BE PROUD OF. MAX, MY FRIEND, YOU´RE ON YOUR WAY  TO BECOMING A MAN. FIRST A BLACK EYE,  THEN FACIAL HAIR, THEN MAKING LOVE TO A WOMAN  YOU LATER FOUND OUT YOUR FATHER PAID FOR  WITH A PIG. VIC! A PIG WELL SPENT,  IF YOU ASK ME. WELL, THERE´S NO HIDING  MAX´S BOXING NOW. YOU´RE GONNA  HAVE TO FACE... [GASPS] YOUR WIFE! NO WAY.  WHEN SHE SEES THAT BLACK EYE, SHE´S NOT GONNA  LET HIM BOX AGAIN. WELL, LET´S TELL HER  IT HAPPENED IN ART CLASS. NO. WE´RE NOT  LYING ANYMORE. THAT´S HOW WE GOT  IN THIS MESS. LOOK, I´M JUST THINKING  ABOUT COMING CLEAN AND TELLING HER  THE TRUTH. [ BANGING ON DOOR ] I CHANGED MY MIND.  HIDE. HEY, YOU´RE HOME EARLY! WOW! LOOK HOW  BEAUTIFUL YOU LOOK! MAX, GET IN HERE AND HELP  WITH THE GROCERIES! WHAT´S UP, MOM? WHY ARE YOU WEARING  CARMEN´S SUNGLASSES? THAT´S IT!  YOU´RE GROUNDED! NOW, YOU GO PUT THOSE  BACK IN HER ROOM, AND YOU THINK  ABOUT WHAT YOU´VE DONE! BUT ON THE WAY, DON´T TRIP ON THE END TABLE  IN THE HALLWAY AND GET A BLACK EYE. OH, NOW THAT I TOLD HIM,  IT´S PROBABLY GONNA HAPPEN. THAT´S CRAZY.  HEY, HEY, COME BACK HERE. TAKE THOSE OFF  BEFORE YOU BREAK THEM. OH, MY GOD.  WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE? I HIT MY HEAD  ON THE END TABLE IN THE HALL. WHAT DID I JUST SAY?! OH, STOP IT. YOUR MOTHER IS TOO SMART  TO BELIEVE THAT. THE TRUTH IS...  I HIT HIM. HE SAID CASTRO  WAS STRONGER THAN SUPERMAN, AND I LOST MY COOL. GEORGE, YOUR TURN. I´M GONNA STICK  WITH FALLING IN THE HALL. MY SON HAS A BLACK EYE, AND I WANT TO KNOW  HOW HE GOT IT... RIGHT NOW. HE´S BEEN BOXING. YOU PUT MY LITTLE BOY  IN THE RING SO OTHER BOYS  COULD HIT HIM?! LOOK, ANGIE,  IT WASN´T MY IDEA. LOOK, I´M NOT GONNA  RAT ANYBODY OUT, BUT THERE´S SOMEBODY  IN THIS KITCHEN THAT SAID "OYE, CHICO,  I GOT IT -- BOXING." OYE, CHICO, BENNY --  HE RATTED YOU OUT. MAX... GO UPSTAIRS  AND ICE YOUR EYE IN YOUR ROOM. I NEED TO TALK  TO YOUR IDIOT. AND YOUR GRANDIDIOTS. LOOK, ANGIE, RELAX. THE KIDS WEAR HEADGEAR,  AND THEY FIGHT SHORT ROUNDS. THEY GET IN THERE --  DING! IT´S OVER. I MEAN, IT´S SAFE. YOU KNOW, IN MY 30 YEARS  OF PRACTICING MEDICINE, I HAVE NEVER ONCE  TREATED A CHILD FOR SERIOUS INJURY  DUE TO BOXING. YOU´RE A CARDIOLOGIST. ONE GOOD THING  ABOUT BEING DIVORCED IS THAT I CAN DO THIS. AND I DON´T GIVE A CRAP,  SO I CAN DO THIS. OKAY.  WHERE SHOULD WE START? THAT YOU AND MAX  LIED TO ME OR THAT YOU GOT HIM  DOING SOMETHING DANGEROUS YOU KNEW I WOULD  NEVER APPROVE OF? OKAY, LOOK, ANGIE, MAX HAS BEEN BOXING FOR THE LAST  TWO WEEKS, ALL RIGHT? HE´S BEEN ABLE  TO FOCUS BETTER IN SCHOOL, AND HE´S SLEEPING BETTER --  ISN´T THAT WHAT WE WANTED? BUT AT WHAT PRICE? I DON´T WANT SOME KID PUNCHING MY SON IN THE FACE  SO HE CAN SLEEP. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. HE HIT HIMSELF  TAKING OFF HIS GLOVE. I BET YOU DIDN´T EVEN  GIVE ART A CHANCE. AT LEAST WITH ART HE´D BE DOING  SOMETHING MEANINGFUL. MEANINGFUL? HEY, DID MICHELANGELO  INVENT A GRILL THAT KNOCKS THE FAT OUT OF MEAT?  I DON´T THINK SO. LOOK, ANGIE, YOU´RE THE ONE  THAT´S ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT HIS SELF-ESTEEM,  OKAY? WELL, BOXING IS GIVING IT  BACK TO HIM. YOU SHOULD SEE HIM.  HE´S LITTLE, HE´S LIKE... I DIDN´T WANT HIM  GETTING HIS SELF-ESTEEM FROM HURTING PEOPLE. Max:  BUT I KNOW I CAN WIN! HONEY,  COME DOWN HERE. PLEASE, MOM?  I REALLY LIKE IT. ANGIE, LOOK,  THERE´S A TOURNAMENT NEXT WEEK. LET ME SHOW YOU  THAT IT´S SAFE. HOW CAN YOU SAY NO  TO THIS FACE? THIS FACE? PLEASE? IT´S THE ONLY THING THAT  MAKES ME FORGET ABOUT SCHOOL. YOU CAN BOX  THIS ONE TIME. IF I DON´T LIKE IT,  IT´S OVER. THANKS, MOM.  I´M GONNA GO GET SOME SLEEP. I GOTTA TRAIN HARD IF I´M GONNA  KICK SOME BUTT NEXT WEEK. OH, MY NIGHT-LIGHT´S OUT, SO I´M GONNA LEAVE MY DOOR OPEN  AND THE HALL LIGHT ON. YOU GOT IT, KILLER. NO, I´M SERIOUS.  LEAVE IT ON. YOU OPPONENT IS BIGGER  BUT SLOWER, HMM? STAY OUT OF HIS REACH,  PICK YOUR SPOTS, AND REMEMBER THE RHYTHM -- GOOM-GOOM BOM, KA-KING,  GOOM-GOOM. GOOM-GOOM BOM, KA-KING,  GOOM-GOOM. OKAY, THAT´D BE GREAT  IF HE WAS FIGHTING  RICKY RICARDO. JUST REMEMBER, IT´S NOT IMPORTANT  WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE. WHAT´S IMPORTANT IS THAT  YOUR MOM THINKS YOU´RE OKAY. SO EVEN IF HE´S  BEATING THE HELL OUT OF YOU, JUST REMEMBER TO SMILE. DON´T WORRY, BABY.  HE´S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT. HEY, DADDY,  WHAT´S A RING-CARD GIRL? SOMETHING YOU´LL NEVER BE. I CAN´T,  BUT THANKS FOR THE SODA. [ BELL DINGS ] OKAY. GENTLEMEN, I WANT A CLEAN,  HARD FIGHT. OBEY MY INSTRUCTIONS. TOUCH ´EM UP. [ BELL DINGS ] [ CROWD CHEERING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I´M GONNA HIT YOU EVERY TIME  MY BABY GETS HIT. YOU LIKE GETTING  HIT IN THE HEAD? OH, THAT WAS A LOW BLOW. NO, IT WASN´T! HE´S GETTING  KILLED IN THERE. WHY DOES HE KEEP  SMILING AT US? I´LL TELL YOU  WHAT´S HAPPENING. HE´S AFRAID TO BE  AGGRESSIVE AND PUNCH BACK BECAUSE HE KNOWS  YOU WON´T APPROVE. MAN,  HE´S GONNA GET HURT. HONEY, IT´S MOMMY! START PUNCHING, BABY!  I APPROVE! THAT´S IT, ANGIE! HE JUST NEEDED TO KNOW  YOU WANTED HIM TO WIN! YOU GOT IT, MAX! DADDY WOULD APPROVE  A STRONG RIGHT CROSS! HE´S OPEN! MAX! NOW DADDY WOULD APPROVE  OF YOU GETTING UP. AND THE CAPITAL  OF CALIFORNIA IS... SACRAMENTO.  CAN I GO TO BED NOW? NO, HONEY,  YOU MIGHT HAVE A CONCUSSION. YOU HAVE TO STAY AWAKE. IT´S KIND OF FUNNY. HE STARTED BOXING TO SLEEP, AND NOW HE CAN´T SLEEP OR ELSE  HE´LL FALL INTO A COMA. WHOO, ANGIE,  LIFE ON THE BIG BLUE MARBLE. CAN I SIT DOWN  FOR A WHILE? ALL RIGHT,  HONEY, BUT I´M GONNA GET YOU A SODA,  SO YOU STAY AWAKE. DON´T BE SAD, MAX. THE FACT THAT YOU  MAY HAVE A CONCUSSION MEANS THAT YOU PROBABLY  HAVE A BRAIN. YOU KNOW, PRETTY SOON  I´LL BE ABLE TO BEAT YOU UP. YEAH, YOU´RE TOUGH,  ALL RIGHT. ♫ LULLABY AND GOOD NIGHT ♫ ♫ AND SLIP INTO YOUR COMA ♫ CARMEN... HOW´S YOUR HEAD FEEL,  HONEY? IT´LL BE OKAY. THE NEXT FIGHT  ISN´T FOR A WEEK, ANYWAY. LOOK, THERE´S NOT GONNA BE  A NEXT FIGHT, MAX. WHEN I SAW YOU GO DOWN  AND HIT YOUR HEAD LIKE THAT, I KNEW IT WASN´T WORTH IT,  SO, UH... BOXING IS OVER. WHY?!  SO, I GOT HURT. I COULD GET HURT  SKATEBOARDING, OR PLAYING SOCCER, OR PLAYING STEAK-KNIFE DARTS  WITH RICKY. I HAVE A CONCUSSION.  I DON´T KNOW WHAT I´M SAYING. THE DIFFERENCE  WITH BOXING IS SOMEONE IS TRYING  TO HURT YOU. WHEN YOU GET HURT, MAX, YOUR MOTHER AND I  WOULD LIKE IT TO BE MORE  OF A SURPRISE... WHICH IS GOOD FOR YOU,  TOO, BECAUSE THE SHOCK  MAKES US CARE MORE. BUT IT FELT GOOD  WHEN I WAS BOXING. IT HELPED ME SLEEP. THEN YOU GOTTA TAKE  THE PRESSURE OFF YOURSELF, MAX. OKAY, WHAT´S THE WORST THING  THAT COULD HAPPEN IF YOU FAIL  THE 5th GRADE? I´LL BE HUMILIATED,  I´LL LOSE ALL MY FRIENDS, I´LL HAVE TO REDO ALL THE WORK  I HATED DOING THIS YEAR, AND EVERY DAY  I GO TO CLASS, I´LL KNOW I´M STUPIDER  THAN EVERYONE ELSE THERE. WELL, YOU´VE OBVIOUSLY  GIVEN THIS SOME THOUGHT. OKAY, HERE´S THE DEAL -- UNTIL WE FIND ANOTHER WAY  TO HELP YOU SLEEP, YOU´RE NOT GOING  THROUGH THIS ALONE. WE´LL STAY UP WITH YOU. WE´LL WATCH TV,  AND WE´LL PLAY GAMES. HEY, AND WE´LL PRANK-CALL  GRANDMA BENNY LATE AT NIGHT  WHEN SHE´S DRUNK. "BEN, BEN DOVER? "THERE´S NO BEN DOVER HERE,  YOU DAMN KIDS. "IF YOU HAD ANY HUEVOS, YOU´D COME OVER HERE  AND SAY THAT TO MY GUN." [ IMITATES CAN OPENING ] OKAY? OKAY. YOU´RE A GOOD DAD. I JUST THOUGHT  HE´D FEEL GOOD IF HE KNEW HE WASN´T  GOING THROUGH THIS ALONE. MAYBE THAT´LL  HELP HIM RELAX AND HE CAN FINALLY  GET SOME SLEEP... LIKE HE IS RIGHT NOW. [ GASPS ] MAX! UP, UP, UP, UP,  UP, UP, UP. THE CAPITAL OF WYOMING IS? I DON´T KNOW.  [ GASPS ] NO, THAT´S GOOD, ANGIE.  HE REALLY DOESN´T KNOW. [ SINGING IN SPANISH ] WHAT? YOUR SKIN. I JUST GOT A SPRAY TAN. I HAVE A HEALTHY GLOW. YOU LOOK LIKE A HAIRY YAM. "GET A SPRAY TAN,"  HE SAID. "CHICKS´LL DIG IT,"  HE SAID. ERNIE, I´M NOT GOING  TO INSULT YOU. I JUST HAVE  A MESSAGE FOR YOU. WILLY WONKA CALLED. HE WANTS YOU BACK  AT THE FACTORY RIGHT AWAY. [ LAUGHS ]
