 WHAT´S RICKY DOING HERE? YOU KNOW HE´S NOT ALLOWED  IN THE HOUSE. I KNOW, BUT HE NEEDED  A RIDE TO THE GAME. MR. LOPEZ,  CAN´T YOU FORGIVE ME? FORGIVE YOU?  YOU BURNED DOWN MY GARAGE! DO YOU KNOW  WHAT´S BURIED RIGHT THERE? NO. MY MELTED GOLF CLUBS. MY LUCKY PUTTER. I FOUR-PUTTED ON 18 THAT DAY, AND THE LAST THING I SAID TO  IT WAS, "I HATE YOU."

 I SAID I´M SORRY. WHY CAN´T YOU ACCEPT MY  APOLOGY LIKE MRS. LOPEZ? SHE ONLY FORGAVE YOU BECAUSE  YOU´RE ALWAYS TELLING HER HOW PRETTY SHE IS. YOU´RE PRETTY, TOO. DIDN´T THINK HE NEEDED  TO HEAR THAT FROM ME. MAX, WAS RICKY  IN THE HOUSE? NO. THEN WHY IS THERE A BAG  OF POTATO CHIPS AND TWO EMPTY JUICE BOXES  IN THE SINK? ´CAUSE YOU LEFT THEM THERE. MOM SAID NOT TO TOUCH IT SO YOU´D LEARN TO  CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF. OKAY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE  SOMETHING SHE MIGHT SAY.

I KNOW I WISH I WAS THAT  PAIR OF BLACK SOCKS RIGHT NOW. OH! RICKY! YOU WERE IN THE HOUSE!  YOU SHOOK UP ALL THE CANS. NO, I DIDN´T! OH, YEAH? WERE YOU OR WERE  YOU NOT IN THE HOUSE? [ WHISTLE BLOWS ] HEY, BREAK IT UP!  BREAK IT UP, YOU TWO! I´M GONNA  CALL BOTH YOUR MOMS! HEY, HEY. WIPE THAT LOOK  OFF YOUR FACE, GEORGE. I´LL RED CARD YOU! [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] Carmen: MAX, MOM WANTS YOU DOWN  FOR BREAKFAST NOW! OH, MAN! DUDE! DUDE! DUDE!  WE OVERSLEPT! HOW ARE WE GONNA GET YOU OUT OF  HERE WITHOUT MY PARENTS SEEING? RELAX. ALL WE NEED  IS A DISTRACTION. HEY, CAN YOU  STOP UP A TOILET? CAN I STOP UP A TOILET? HEY, TWERP, BETTER GET  DOWNSTAIRS IF YOU -- YOU ARE SO DEAD. CARMEN,  PLEASE DON´T SAY ANYTHING. [ SIGHS ] ALL RIGHT, THEN YOU´LL HAVE TO  CLEAN MY ROOM FOR A WHOLE MONTH. NO WAY!  OKAY. I´LL DO IT! I´LL EVEN MAKE YOUR BED AND FOLD  THAT PINK FLANNEL SHEET BACK JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT. WAIT A SECOND.  HAVE YOU BEEN IN MY ROOM? NO. UNLESS YOU´RE  DOWN WITH IT. YES, I AM DOWN WITH IT. AND WHEN YOU´RE IN MY ROOM,  YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO? Come here. I COULD HAVE TOLD YOU  THAT WAS COMING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAX? JUST THROWING OUT  SOME OLD CLOTHES. HEY, MAX! BRING THAT  TRASH BAG OVER HERE. I WANT TO THROW OUT  THESE COFFEE GROUNDS. THAT´S OKAY.  I´LL GET ANOTHER BAG FOR YOU. WHY WASTE A BAG? I GOT TO POUR THIS  HOT BACON GREASE IN THERE. IT´S REALLY FULL. WELL, THEN I´LL JUMP ON IT  AND SQUASH IT DOWN. AAH! GET BACK HERE, RICKY! GEORGE, HOW MANY TIMES  HAVE I TOLD YOU? MAKE SURE THEY´RE DEAD BEFORE  YOU PUT THEM IN THE BAG. ANGIE, START THE OVEN! WE´RE HAVING RICKY,  THE OTHER WHITE MEAT. [ INTRO TO WAR´S "LOW RIDER"  PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ ♫ THE LOW RIDER  IS A LITTLE HIGHER ♫ YOU DID IT THIS TIME,  MAX. YOU´RE GROUNDED FOR SNEAKING  RICKY IN THE HOUSE. HE´S ALREADY GROUNDED FOR  SKATEBOARDING IN THE HOUSE. ALL RIGHT, THEN NO VIDEO GAMES  FOR A MONTH! WE TOOK THEM AWAY FOR EAVESDROPPING  ON THE PHONE CALLS. ALLOWANCE? TOOK IT AWAY WHEN  THEY BURNED DOWN THE GARAGE. OKAY,  YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE. FOR THE REST  OF THE MONTH... YOU´RE NOT ALLOWED  TO USE YOUR HANDS! MOM! OPEN THE DOOR  WITH YOUR MOUTH. GET YOUR HAND OFF THE RAIL. RICKY, DOES YOUR MOTHER  EVEN KNOW YOU´RE HERE? YEAH. I TOLD HER YOU SAID  I COULD SLEEP OVER. I´M GONNA CALL HER AND TELL HER  TO COME PICK YOU UP. [ SIGHS ] LISTEN, MR. LOPEZ... WAIT. OKAY, SHE´S GONE.  GET BACK IN THE BAG. I DON´T TRUST YOU! HUH? DID YOU THINK  YOU COULD GET AWAY WITH THIS? THIS IS MY HOUSE, MAN, AND NO ONE SPENDS THE NIGHT IN  MY HOUSE WITHOUT ME KNOWING IT. I SLEPT HERE LAST WEEKEND,  TOO. YOU TRY IT AGAIN AND YOU´LL  BE SLEEPING IN THE DUMPSTER WITH RACCOONS  GNAWING OFF YOUR FACE. FOR THE LAST TIME, SON,  GET OUT OF THE BAG! IT´S DANGEROUS! I DON´T WANT ANYTHING  TO HAPPEN TO YOU. GEORGE, CAN I TALK TO YOU  OUTSIDE? SURE.  ARE YOU OKAY, CARE BEAR? IS HIS MOM  COMING TO GET HIM? YES. IN THREE DAYS. WHAT?! GEORGE, SHE´S GOING THROUGH  A TOUGH TIME. SHE JUST BROKE UP WITH  HER BOYFRIEND, RAY. IT´S BEEN REALLY UGLY. AND BRENDA, THE BABYSITTER THEY  NORMALLY USE, IS RAY´S SISTER. SO OF COURSE, SHE´S TAKING HIS  SIDE AND BABYSITTING HIS KIDS, SARAH AND JESSICA. NONE OF THIS  WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THEY HAD  JUST STAYED IN MONTANA. YOU WERE ON THE PHONE  20 SECONDS. I CAN´T HELP IT.  I´M A LISTENER. AND I HEARD SOMEONE  WHO NEEDS OUR HELP. HE´S A BAD INFLUENCE  ON MAX, AND I DON´T WANT HIM  IN THE HOUSE. HONEY, IT´S JUST  A COUPLE OF DAYS. WE´LL WATCH HIM LIKE HAWKS. I REALLY THINK  WE SHOULD DO THIS. AND I ALREADY  TOLD HER WE WOULD. ALL RIGHT. NOW I GET TO MAKE ONE DECISION  WITHOUT CONSULTING YOU. NO, I´M NOT  WEARING THE OUTFIT AGAIN. WHAT´S THE BIG DEAL? IT´S ONLY ON FOR,  LIKE, 10 SECONDS. NO, YOU´RE GETTING  TOO DEPENDENT ON IT. HEY, WHAT´S HE DOING  BY THE STOVE? I´M MAKING PANCAKES.  YOU WANT SOME? THEY TASTE GREAT. YEAH? THEY´RE NOT THAT GREAT. BET YOU CAN´T COOK THAT CHICKEN  THAT´S IN THE FREEZER. I´LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. YEAH, YOU SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO  WITH THOSE LITTLE RED POTATOES AND MAYBE A NICE SALAD. I DON´T KNOW.  SURPRISE ME. WOW, THIS SMELLS GREAT. I COOK FOR MY MOM  ALL THE TIME. SHE´S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU  FOR A SON. HOW COME YOU DON´T  COOK ANYTHING FOR ME, MAX? ´CAUSE I DON´T HAVE TO WORK  FOR YOUR LOVE. I MEAN, WHO´S MY COMPETITION?  CARMEN? I DON´T THINK SO. MAX, WE BETTER  GET TO SCHOOL. THE COFFEE´S ALL SET. BUT I DIDN´T TURN IT ON  SO IT WILL BE FRESH. THAT KID´S UP TO SOMETHING.  I JUST DON´T KNOW WHAT IT IS. GEORGE, EVER SINCE HE GOT HERE  HE´S BEEN HELPFUL AND COURTEOUS. HE EVEN MADE US BREAKFAST. HE´S LURING US IN. IT´S LIKE WHEN I STAY UP  LATE AT NIGHT AND PUT OUT  A LITTLE PIECE OF CHEESE, AND WHEN THAT FIRST MOUSE  SHOWS UP, I TAKE OUT THAT LITTLE HAMMER  AND BAM! I RELEASE HIM  INTO THE WILD. GEORGE, LET´S GO! I GOT TO FILL UP  BEFORE WE GET TO WORK. I´M HEADED OUT, TOO.  I GOT A LONG DAY AHEAD OF ME. BIG PLANS, PRINCESS? YES, IT´S La MARIE´S  COMMUNITY SERVICE DAY. WE´RE GIVING FREE MAKEOVERS  TO HOMELESS WOMEN TO HELP THEM WITH  THEIR SELF-ESTEEM. OH, THAT´S SO NICE. YOU KNOW, IT´S GOOD  TO LOOK YOUR BEST WHEN YOU´RE HAVING A SHOUTING  MATCH WITH A LAMPPOST. COME ON, MOM.  WHAT ANGIE DOES IS IMPORTANT. THANK YOU. WEARING JUST  THE RIGHT LIPSTICK SAYS, "I MAY EAT OUT OF A DUMPSTER  AND PEE IN A MILK CARTON, BUT DAMN IT, I´M A PRETTY,  PRETTY LADY." WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO? MAYBE WE SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL.  I HAVE A TEST TODAY. [ High-pitched voice ]  I HAVE A TEST TODAY. I´M A NERDY LITTLE GIRL. I´M NOT A NERD.  I´M BARELY PASSING! ALL RIGHT, THEN.  LET´S HAVE SOME FUN. HEY, WHOSE CAR KEYS  ARE THESE? MY DAD´S. OH, MAN.  WHAT HAPPENED? I DON´T WANT  TO TALK ABOUT IT! ERNIE, DON´T TELL ME SOME LIE  ABOUT HOW YOU FELL AGAIN. SOONER OR LATER, YOU´RE GONNA  HAVE TO LEAVE THAT MAN. MAN, I´M DONE REFFING SOCCER. WHY? LAST NIGHT,  I MAKE ONE CLOSE CALL, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE´S A MOB OF ANGRY PARENTS  IN MY FACE. NEXT THING I KNOW,  I´M ON THE GROUND. SOME OF THOSE DADS  GET CRAZY. ACTUALLY,  IT WAS A SOCCER MOM. AND SHE WAS PREGNANT,  SO I COULDN´T PUNCH HER BACK. HEY, GEORGE,  MAX´S SCHOOL´S ON THE PHONE. THEY WANT TO KNOW  IF HE´S HOME SICK. HE´S NOT SICK.  I SAW HIM LEAVE THIS MORNING. WELL, HE NEVER SHOWED UP. RICKY.  I KNEW IT. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU SEE, I WAS REFFING  A SOCCER GAME -- STOP. ALREADY BORING. MAX! MAX!! Ricky: COME ON!  TRY IT AGAIN! Max: IT WON´T MOVE!  IT´S STUCK! GET --  GET OUT OF THE CAR! NO, SAVE YOURSELF! STAY IN THE CAR,  LOCK THE DOOR!  ERNIE! OPEN THE BACK FOR ME!  HURRY! HE´S COMING!  HURRY! HOW THE HELL  DID THAT HAPPEN? WELL, WE WERE TRYING TO  SURPRISE YOU AND WASH YOUR CAR, BUT...  THE HOSE WAS TOO SHORT. I LOVE YOU, DAD. LOOK, I WANT THE TRUTH. OKAY, HERE´S WHAT HAPPENED. WE DITCHED SCHOOL,  BUT IT WAS LUCKY BECAUSE TWO GANGBANGERS  WERE STEALING YOUR CAR. WE SCARED THEM AWAY. BUT WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO PUT  THE CAR BACK IN THE DRIVEWAY, WE CRASHED, SO... I GUESS YOU´RE WELCOME,  MR. LOPEZ! YOU, YOU´RE GOING BACK  TO SCHOOL. WE´LL DEAL WITH THIS  TONIGHT. AND YOU --  YOU´RE OUT OF HERE, MAN! I´M TAKING YOU BACK  TO YOUR MOTHER. AND SAY GOODBYE TO MAX. BECAUSE THAT´S THE LAST TIME  YOU´RE GONNA SEE HIM. DO YOU KNOW YOU COULD  HAVE KILLED SOMEONE?! WELL, HEY,  YOUR MOM SITS OUT HERE. WHAT IF SHE WAS  IN THAT CHAIR? DON´T TRY TO CHEER ME UP!  COME ON. YOU TWO WAIT HERE.  I´LL TALK TO HIS MOM ALONE. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW, THAT WAS A PRETTY  STUPID STUNT YOU TWO PULLED. I KNOW. DO YOU THINK HE´LL EVER  LET ME SEE MAX AGAIN? HE´S PRETTY MAD, RICKY. MAX IS MY BEST FRIEND. YOU KNOW WHAT? ONCE GEORGE COOLS DOWN, I´LL TRY  AND TALK TO HIM, ALL RIGHT? THANKS, ERNIE. [ Chuckling ]  ACTUALLY, YEAH. ONE TIME, GEORGE AND I  BROKE INTO SCHOOL WITH A WHOLE BUNCH OF  SPRAY PAINT, AND WE, UH-- MADE A BANNER THAT SAID,  "LEARNING IS COOL." WHOO!  THOSE WERE THE DAYS, MAN! [ Slurred ] YOU´RE NOT  THE USUAL DELIVERY GUY. WHERE´S MY ORDER? NO, I´M GEORGE LOPEZ.  I BROUGHT RICKY WITH ME. [ LAUGHS ] WHAT WAS RICKY DOING  AT THE LIQUOR STORE? HEY, NO, I´M MAX´S DAD.  RICKY WAS STAYING WITH US. OHH, YOU´LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.  I JUST WOKE UP. WHY DON´T YOU COME IN? I´M WAITING FOR SOME WINE  TO BE DELIVERED. YOU KNOW, IT´S 10:30  IN THE MORNING. IT´S A WHITE WINE. LISTEN, I GOT TO TALK  TO YOU ABOUT RICKY. OH, NO, HE´S NOT HERE. I LEFT HIM WITH  THE NICEST PEOPLE. YOU LEFT HIM WITH ME. [ Laughing ]  OHH, I´M SORRY! I JUST CAN´T  THINK STRAIGHT. I JUST BROKE UP  WITH MY BOYFRIEND AND I´M TRYING TO  GET MY LIFE TOGETHER. [ SIGHS ] MAYBE I SHOULD CALL HIS DAD.  CAN I GET HIS NUMBER? YEAH. NOT FROM ME. I HAVE NO IDEA  WHERE HE IS. BUT IF YOU FIND HIM,  YOU TELL THAT LOSER THAT HE OWES ME 10 YEARS´ WORTH  OF CHILD SUPPORT. RIGHT. OKAY, LOOK, MAYBE I SHOULD JUST  TAKE RICKY BACK TO SCHOOL. YEAH. [ Chuckling ] NOW´S NOT  A VERY GOOD TIME FOR ME. IF YOU WANT... HE COULD STAY WITH US  FOR A COUPLE MORE DAYS. OH, THANK YOU! YOU´RE AN ANGEL. [ Off-key]  ♫ ANGEL ♫ ♫ YOU´RE MY ANGEL ♫ ♫ SENT FROM HEAVEN ♫ ♫ TO TAKE MY BOY ♫ ♫ INTO YOUR HOUSE  FOR A WHILE ♫ ♫ UH ♫ [ Off-key ] ♫ THE ANGEL  IS SHUTTING THE DOOR ♫ HERE, RICKY.  PUT YOUR STUFF IN MAX´S ROOM. I´LL GIVE YOU A HAND. YOU WERE RIGHT.  RICKY IS A BAD SEED. I NEVER WANT TO SEE  THAT LITTLE PUNK AGAIN. I BROUGHT HIM BACK. HE´S IN THE HOUSE. OH, HE WOULDN´T TELL YOU  WHERE HE LIVES, HUH? OKAY,  I´LL GET IT OUT OF HIM. YOU JUST TURN UP THE STEREO  REAL LOUD SO THE NEIGHBORS  DON´T HEAR ANYTHING. ANGIE... I WENT TO HIS APARTMENT. HIS MOM WAS DRUNK  AT 10:30 IN THE MORNING. OH, MAN. NO WONDER  HE´S SO SCREWED UP. I COULDN´T LEAVE HIM THERE. I WANT HIM  TO STAY WITH US FOR A WHILE. ARE YOU CRAZY? FIRST THE GARAGE,  THEN THE FENCE. HE´S GETTING CLOSER  TO WHERE WE SLEEP, GEORGE. ANGIE, HIS DAD WALKED OUT  ON HIM, TOO. HONEY...  THIS ISN´T YOUR LIFE. NO, IT MIGHT BE WORSE. MY MOM WAS ROUGH, BUT AT LEAST  SHE WASN´T A DRUNK. LISTEN, YOU KNOW I´M ALWAYS  THE FIRST TO HELP OUT. I SPENT THE ENTIRE MORNING  GIVING MAKEOVERS TO 45 HOMELESS WOMEN,  AND IT WASN´T EASY. YOU TRY CONVINCING A LADY  WITH LEAVES IN HER HAIR THAT SHE IS NOT AN AUTUMN. SO WHY CAN´T WE  HELP RICKY? BECAUSE...WE HAVE TO  THINK ABOUT MAX FIRST. HE´S ABOUT TO FAIL  THE FIFTH GRADE, AND RICKY IS A BAD INFLUENCE  ON HIM. YOU SAID SO YOURSELF. I DON´T WANT HIM  IN OUR HOUSE. WELL, IF HE CAN´T GO HOME  AND HE CAN´T STAY HERE, WHAT´S HE SUPPOSED TO DO? WHAT IF HE STAYS WITH ME? COME ON, ERNIE. NO, HE CAN STAY WITH ME  AND MY FOLKS. YOU SERIOUS? YEAH, YOU REMEMBER. MY MOM AND DAD  USED TO BE FOSTER PARENTS. I COULD GET CERTIFIED WHILE  RICKY´S STAYING WITH US. BUT, DUDE, COME ON. TAKING ON A KID, ISN´T THAT  GONNA CUT INTO YOUR SOCIAL -- WHAT ABOUT CLIMBING UP  THE CORPORATE -- WHAT IF YOU  MEET A GIRL WHO -- YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU CAN TAKE MY KIDS, TOO. THIS IS GONNA WORK,  GEORGE. I CAN ACTUALLY MAKE  A DIFFERENCE IN SOMEONE´S LIFE. ERNIE´S PARENTS DO HAVE  PLENTY OF ROOM. THEY EVEN HAVE THAT PANELED  BASEMENT DOWNSTAIRS WHERE ERNIE TRIED TO DO HIS OWN  CABLE-ACCESS SHOW, "IT´S ME, ERNIE." I´M GONNA GO TALK TO RICKY. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF HE  DRIVES A CAR THROUGH YOUR FENCE? GEORGE, MY DAD´S 75.  HE DOES THAT ONCE A WEEK. HEY, I CAN´T FIND DAD ANYWHERE. COME ON MOM. WE´RE GOING TO BE  LATE FOR MY POETRY READING. GEORGE I KNOW YOU´RE IN THERE. YOU´RE GOING TO MISS YOUR OWN  DAUGHTER´S POETRY READING. I CAN´T HEAR YOU. I´M TRASH.
