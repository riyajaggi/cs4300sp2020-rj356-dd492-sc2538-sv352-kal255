 THIS SUCKS. IF YOU HADN´T DISOBEYED  YOUR FATHER AND HECKLED  THE PRESIDENT, YOU WOULDN´T BE  GETTING PUNISHED. YEAH, BUT MAKING ME FOLD  DAD´S UNDERWEAR IS CRUEL AND UNUSUAL. THIS IS CRUEL. AND THIS IS UNUSUAL. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] HELLO? George: Angie.

 Look, it´s not  that simple. THEY WANT TO EXTRADITE ME  TO ARIZONA. MANNY PRESSED CHARGES AGAINST ME  FOR PUNCHING HIM. YOUR OWN FATHER  DID THIS TO YOU? PUNCHING WAS TOO GOOD  FOR HIM. NEXT TIME SPLIT HIS SKULL  WITH A PICKAX, AND WE´LL BURY HIM  IN THE DESERT. YOU KNOW, THEY LISTEN IN  ON THESE PHONE CALLS. Look, I don´t have  a lot of time. You got to get me  a lawyer right away, and a good one. NOT ONE FROM  THE SPANISH TV. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] CINCO, CINCO, CINCO,  SIETE, UNO, CINCO, CINCO. I GOT TO GO, ANGIE. GEORGE, WAIT. I LOVE YOU. GIRL, YOU BETTER BRING ME  THAT MONEY! I LOVE YOU, TOO.  [ COUGHS ] ´SUP, HOMES? MAN, I GOT  BABY-MAMA DRAMA. YOU GOT A VISITOR. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,  MANNY? I CAME TO TALK TO YOU. I´M SORRY I HAD TO  DO IT THIS WAY. HEY, DON´T APOLOGIZE. THREE SQUARE MEALS  AND A ROOF OVER MY HEAD. HEY, YOU´RE FINALLY  BEING A DAD. LOOK SOME SKINHEADS  CAME TO MY SLEEPOVER. I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU  IN PHOENIX, BUT I LOST MY TRAIN  OF THOUGHT WHEN YOU PUNCHED ME  IN THE FACE. LOOK, SAVE IT.  I HEARD IT ALREADY. YOU DIDN´T LEAVE ME.  YOU LEFT MY MOM. LOOK, I LEFT  SO I COULD START OVER. I TOLD MYSELF YOU WERE  BETTER OFF WITHOUT ME. BUT THE TRUTH IS I THOUGHT  I WAS BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU. THAT´S AN AWFUL THING  TO THINK ABOUT YOUR SON. IT´S EASIER  NOT TO FEEL GUILTY WHEN YOU DON´T HAVE TO  LOOK AT THE PERSON YOU HURT. I´M SORRY YOU NEVER HAD  A FATHER, GEORGE. PLEASE FORGIVE ME  FOR NOT BEING THERE. LOOK...I´D LIKE TO BE  PART OF YOUR LIFE. I´LL BE IN L.A.  TILL TOMORROW. I´M GONNA DROP  THE CHARGES NOW, BUT YOU WON´T BE RELEASED  UNTIL I´M SAFELY IN THE CAR. OKAY, LOPEZ,  YOU´RE FREE TO GO. THAT WAS FAST. NOT YOU.  MRS. LOPEZ. [ SIGHS ] IT´S ABOUT TIME. I´D CALL HIM. YOU DON´T WANT UNRESOLVED  ISSUES IN YOUR LIFE. TRUST ME, HONEY. [ INTRO TO WAR´S "LOW RIDER"  PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ ♫ THE LOW RIDER  IS A LITTLE HIGHER ♫ ANGIE. OH! I´M SO GLAD YOU´RE HOME. DADDY, I WAS SO WORRIED  ABOUT YOU! THANK GOD YOU´RE FREE. CARMEN, I WAS  SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. THANK GOD YOU´RE  STILL GROUNDED. WHAT WAS IT LIKE  IN THERE? NOBODY TALKED TO ME,  THE FOOD SUCKED, I WAS AFRAID  TO GO TO SLEEP... SO IT WAS A LITTLE BETTER  THAN MY CHILDHOOD. WHY´D YOU PUNCH  YOUR DAD? WELL, MAX,  HE WAS BAD TO ME. SO... I SPANKED HIS FACE. I DON´T UNDERSTAND. WHY WOULD HE HAVE YOU  ARRESTED AND THEN JUST DROP  THE CHARGES? HE WANTED TO TALK TO ME. HE SAID  THAT HE WAS SORRY AND THAT HE WANTS TO BE  PART OF MY LIFE. ARE YOU GOING TO  FORGIVE HIM? NO! NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?  SCREW HIM. HE WRECKED YOU  EMOTIONALLY, AND I KNOW THAT´S GOT  SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW YOU TREAT ME. IT HAS TO.  IT JUST HAS TO. MAX, GIVE ME A MINUTE  WITH YOUR FATHER, HUH? WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? PART OF ME FEELS LIKE  IT´S WAY TOO LATE TO FORGIVE HIM AFTER WHAT  HE´S PUT ME THROUGH, BUT I JUST DON´T  WANT TO BE ANGRY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE  LIKE MY MOM. WELL, YOU TRACKED HIM DOWN  FOR A REASON, HONEY. WHAT DID YOU WANT  FROM HIM? MY WHOLE LIFE I JUST  WANTED TO KNOW HIM. THAT´S ALL I EVER WANTED. WELL, THIS IS YOUR CHANCE. IT´S NEVER GOOD TO HAVE  UNRESOLVED ISSUES, HONEY. THAT´S WHAT THE OTHER  MRS. LOPEZ SAID. ALL RIGHT. YOU´RE PROBABLY WONDERING  WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY, SO LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN. HEY, EVERYONE´S SCARED  OF YOU SINCE THEY HEARD  YOU BEAT UP YOUR DAD. THEY´RE WORKING  REAL HARD. MY OLD MAN´S LOW PRODUCTIVITY  DISAPPOINTED ME. AND I DON´T LIKE BEING  DISAPPOINTED. NOW GET BACK TO WORK! VAMOS!  [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] HEY, JACK,  LET ME EXPLAIN. OH, YOU DON´T HAVE TO EXPLAIN  ANYTHING TO ME, GEORGE. WE´VE ALL TAKEN A GOOD SWING  AT OUR FATHERS. I TOOK A SHOT AT MINE ONCE  DURING A HUNTING TRIP. JUST GRAZED HIM... BUT HE KNEW. WHAT´D YOUR DAD  FINALLY DIE OF? FISHING ACCIDENT. ANYWAY, GEORGE... I WANT YOU  TO TELL ME THE TRUTH. SURE, JACK. IS THIS SOME KIND  OF MID-LIFE CRISIS YOU´RE GOING THROUGH  HERE, BUD? THIS LONG HAIR, THIS REBELLING AGAINST  AUTHORITY... ...STEALING  THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH? I DIDN´T TAKE IT. THAT´S JUST SOMETHING I YELL  WHEN I SEE THE COPS. WE STARTED PUTTING TAPES IN THE SECURITY CAMERAS  LAST MONTH. GEORGE,  I SAW YOU TAKE IT. I SAW YOU STEAL THE SPEECH  AND, OFF THE RECORD, I SAW RANDY MAKING OUT  WITH SOME LITTLE GUY IN THE STORAGE CLOSET. DOES THE SECRET SERVICE  KNOW ABOUT THAT TAPE? NO.  PHEW! NO, I GOT TO IT  BEFORE THEY DID, BUT IF YOU DON´T GIVE  THAT SPEECH BACK AND CUT YOUR HAIR... I´M GONNA GIVE IT  TO THEM. JACK, Y-Y-YOU HATE  MY HAIR SO MUCH THAT YOU´D TURN ME IN  TO THE GOVERNMENT? [ SIGHS ] YEAH. AND NOT JUST THE HAIR,  GEORGE. LOSE THE CHIN BADGER. HEY, HEY, MOM! THANKS FOR VISITING ME  IN JAIL. LISTEN, I COULD NOT  GO DOWN THERE, UNH-UNH. I DIDN´T WANT TO BE FRAMED  FOR SOME 30-YEAR-OLD CRIME IN EL PASO THAT  MIGHT´VE BEEN COMMITTED WITH MY FINGERPRINTS. WE WERE ON THE RUN  THAT SUMMER? THERE´S NO GAME CALLED  "GAS STATION PEEL OUT"! GEORGE... I HEAR MANNY´S STILL  TRYING TO BE DADDY. IF YOU LET THAT DIRTBAG  BACK IN YOUR LIFE, IT´LL KILL ME. THAT´S GOOD TO KNOW. NOW I CAN STOP LOOKING  FOR THAT SILVER BULLET. WHAT´S THAT CARD FOR? OH, THIS?  IT´S NOTHING. IT´S JUST THE NUMBER  OF A RETIREMENT HOME FOR SOME OLD BAT. YOU DON´T KNOW HER. OH, OKAY, THEN HERE. WHAT´S THAT? PUNK. HA HA! MANNY´S NUMBER?  W-W-W-WHAT IS THIS FOR? MOM, LOOK, I´M JUST GONNA  CALL HIM TO SAY GOODBYE. THAT´S ALL.  DON´T WORRY ABOUT IT. THAT´S GOOD. ´CAUSE IF I EVER SEE  THAT MAN AGAIN, I´M GONNA REACH DOWN  HIS THROAT, I´M GONNA PULL OUT  HIS STOMACH, I´M GONNA STRETCH IT  OVER HIS HEAD LIKE A HAT, AND THEN I AM GONNA SOCK HIM  IN HIS STOMACH-FACE. CAREFUL, HE MIGHT KICK YOU  IN YOUR BOOB-KNEES. Manny: Hello? MANNY, IT´S GEORGE. George,  how are you doing? [ SIGHS ]  I´M FINE. ARE YOU STILL HEADING BACK  TO PHOENIX? Yes. Yes, I am. YEAH, LISTEN, UH,  I´VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS. WHY DON´T YOU COME OVER  FOR DINNER TONIGHT? HEY. DID YOU TELL HIM  ABOUT US? COME ON, THE MAN  JUST GOT OUT OF JAIL. THAT´S NO EXCUSE  IN MY FAMILY. I´M GOING IN THERE  AND TELLING HIM NOW. NO, NO, NO,  YOU´RE NOT. YOU´RE NOT GONNA MAKE  A SCENE AT WORK. WHY ARE YOU HIDING ME,  BENNY? I DON´T GET THIS. SOMEBODY HIT ON ME  YESTERDAY, AND I NEED TO KNOW --  AM I TAKEN OR NOT? OKAY,  I´LL TELL YOU WHAT. WE ARE GONNA GO TO GEORGE´S  HOUSE TOGETHER TONIGHT, AND WE´RE GONNA TELL HIM  EVERYTHING. NOW... YOU TELL MAMA  WHO HIT ON YOU. WHAT´S THAT SMELL? I´M PUTTING OUT CHEESE. I TOLD YOU  JUST BECAUSE HE´S RICH, I DON´T WANT US TO PRETEND  WE´RE SOMETHING THAT WE´RE NOT. PUTTING OUT CHEESE.  TE LOCA. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] I DON´T WANT TO  DO THIS. WHAT? I CHANGED MY MIND.  DON´T ANSWER IT. GEORGE, WE INVITED HIM  OVER HERE. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? [ DOORBELL RINGS ] HIDE! HONEY, IF YOU DON´T  WANT TO DO THIS, WE WON´T. I WILL HIDE BEHIND  THIS COUCH WITH YOU. I WON´T BREATHE. I WON´T MOVE A MUSCLE  IF THAT´S WHAT YOU WANT. I LOVE YOU. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO ANSWERS  THE DOOR AROUND HERE? MAX! I´M GETTING IT! HI. I´M ANGIE. WELCOME TO OUR HOME. MANNY,  THIS IS MY SON, MAX. HI, NICE TO MEET YOU. IS THAT FOR ME? OH, SORRY.  THANKS. OH, I GET IT. I BET YOU´RE GONNA FIND  A $20 BILL IN MY EAR, HUH? MAX, MANNERS.  GO GET YOUR SISTER. MANNY,  HAVE A SEAT, PLEASE. OH, MANNY, THIS IS  MY DAUGHTER, CARMEN. SO, THIS IS WHERE DAD´S  DYSFUNCTION COMES FROM. YEAH, AFTER TONIGHT YOU MIGHT  WANT TO ABANDON HER, TOO. IT´S OKAY. I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT  SITUATION, SO EVERYONE SHOULD JUST SAY  WHAT THEY´RE FEELING. I LIKE BACON,  AND I HATE BEES. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT  HORSES? I HAVE A STABLE  FULL OF THEM. MAYBE YOU CAN COME OUT  TO MY RANCH AND RIDE THEM SOMETIME. OKAY, EASY, SEABISCUIT. LET´S TAKE THIS  ONE STEP AT A TIME. WE´LL TALK ABOUT IT  OVER DINNER. I SEE YOU GOT GOLF CLUBS.  PLAY MUCH? I GET OUT  ONCE IN A WHILE. LAST WEEKEND I WAS HAVING  THE ROUND OF MY LIFE, AND THEN I PUT THREE SHOTS  IN THE WATER ON 18. I PUT MORE BALLS  IN THE WATER THAN THE MEN´S OLYMPIC  SWIM TEAM. GEORGE! HEY, GEORGE... SOME IDIOT PARKED RIGHT IN  THE MIDDLE OF YOUR DRIVEWAY. HELLO, BENITA. HOW THE HELL COULD YOU  LET HIM INTO YOUR HOME? TAKE IT EASY, MOM.  RELAX. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] RANDY, WHAT ARE  YOU DOING HERE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE  GONNA WAIT IN THE CAR. DIDN´T SEEM RIGHT. I SHOULD BE HERE  WHEN YOU TELL HIM. TELL ME WHAT? RANDALL´S MY LOVER. 42 AND HAIR. W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN,  "LOVER"? I DIDN´T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING  IN FRONT OF THE KIDS, BUT... WHAT THIS MAN DOES IS BETTER  AND LONGER THAN THAT MAN. I KNOW YOU´RE NOT HAPPY  ABOUT THIS, GEORGE, BUT I TAKE CARE  OF YOUR MOM. THIS IS WHY WE HIDE. I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU I DIDN´T WANT YOU DATING  SOMEBODY FROM WORK. YEAH, AND I TOLD YOU  NOT TO FORGIVE THIS JACKASS! BENITA, I´M NOT HERE  TO FIGHT. I´M JUST HERE TO MAKE THINGS  RIGHT WITH MY SON. YOUR SON? W-WHERE WERE YOU  WHEN HE WOKE UP CRYING IN THE MIDDLE  OF THE NIGHT, HUH? WHERE WERE YOU  WHEN HE FELL OFF HIS BIKE AND NEEDED SOMEBODY  TO KISS HIS BOO-BOO? WHERE WERE YOU  ALL THOSE TIMES WHEN HE NEEDED LOVE  AND ENCOURAGEMENT, HUH? WHERE WERE YOU? MAYBE I SHOULD GO.  I SHOULD. YOU´RE STAYING.  I INVITED YOU. NO, NO, NO,  LET HIM GO. I WANT MY GRANDKIDS TO SEE HIM  WALK OUT THE DOOR THE WAY HE WALKED OUT  ON US. OKAY, KIDS, UPSTAIRS.  YOU, OUTSIDE. FINE.  COME ON, RANDY. NO, RANDY STAYS HERE. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU WERE  CALLING HIM TO SAY GOODBYE. YOU LIED TO ME.  WHAT ELSE DON´T I KNOW? YOU WANT TO KNOW?  YEAH. WHEN YOU DIE YOU´RE BEING  CREMATED AT THE PARK. AND I´M GONNA DO IT MYSELF. THERE, YOU KNOW EVERYTHING. GEORGE... HOW CAN YOU BETRAY ME  LIKE THIS? I HATE THAT MAN. LOOK, MOM, SO DID I,  BUT I´M SICK OF IT. LOOK, I´M GONNA GIVE HIM  A CHANCE. GEORGE, GEORGE... HE´S RESPONSIBLE  FOR ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS. HE´S THE REASON THAT YOU CAN´T  HANDLE ME DATING RANDY. WHAT ARE YOU  TALKING ABOUT? YOU´VE DONE THIS  SINCE YOU WERE A KID. YOU DON´T WANT TO SHARE  YOUR MOMMY. ALL THOSE MEN  WHO WOULD CALL THE HOUSE, AND YOU NEVER GAVE ME  ANY OF THE MESSAGES, AND THEN YOU WOULD TELL ME  HOW MEAN THEY WERE TO YOU WHEN I WASN´T LOOKING. AFTER A WHILE  IT GOT TO BE SUCH A HASSLE, I JUST STOPPED DATING. REALLY, MOM, Y-YOU GAVE UP  YOUR LOVE LIFE FOR ME? NO, I JUST STOPPED DATING. MY LOVE LIFE WENT ON BEHIND YOUR BACK  IN THE GARAGE. GEORGE, DON´T YOU SEE? YOU DIDN´T WANT ME  TO DATE BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID  OF LOSING ANOTHER PARENT BECAUSE HE LEFT US, AND NOW YOU WANT HIM  BACK IN YOUR LIFE. HOW CAN YOU DO THIS  TO ME? MOM, I´M NOT  DOING THIS TO YOU. I´M DOING IT FOR ME. LOOK, WHETHER  YOU LIKE IT OR NOT... HE´S THE ONLY DAD  I GOT. FINE. I CAN´T STOP YOU. AND I CAN´T STOP YOU  FROM SEEING RANDY. BUT IF YOU´RE GONNA DO THIS,  I SHOULD WARN YOU -- THERE´S A TAPE  OF HIM MAKING OUT WITH A LITTLE GUY  IN THE STORAGE CLOSET. WE CAN GO NOW. GEORGE, YOU COOL WITH  WHAT WE GOT HERE? YOU BETTER NOT HURT  MY SON AGAIN. IT WOULD BE A REAL SHAME IF ALL OF YOUR HORSES DIED  IN A BARN FIRE AND THEN YOU DIED  IN A HOUSE FIRE, KNOWING RIGHT BEFORE YOU ALL OF YOUR HORSES HAD  JUST DIED IN A BARN FIRE. [ LAUGHING ] [ LAUGHS ] DO YOU WANT TO TRY THIS  ANOTHER TIME? NO, MAN, LET´S JUST  FINISH EATING. WHAT´S THAT SMELL? I´M PUTTING OUT CHEESE. PUTTING OUT CHEESE? ANGIE, I TOLD YOU JUST  BECAUSE HE´S RICH, LET´S NOT TRY TO PRETEND  WE´RE SOMETHING THAT WE´RE... [ DOORBELL RINGS ] AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO GETS  THE DOOR AROUND HERE? MAX! [ LAUGHS ]
