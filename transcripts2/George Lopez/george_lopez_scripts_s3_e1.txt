 AND HALF THE FACTORY´S  LATINO. WE´RE DESIRABLE NOW. MOM, ONE DAY WE´LL PUT  A LATINO IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IT´LL STILL BE WHITE  BUT WITH, LIKE, BLUE TRIM. LITTLE CERAMIC DUCKS  IN THE FRONT YARD. YEAH, AND EVERY MORNING,  THE PRESIDENT WILL DROP BY THE PAINT STORE AND PICK UP  HIS SECRETARY OF STATE... CHATO. THIS IS SO EXCITING.  I CAN´T WAIT! I´M GOING TO MEET THE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES. NO, NO, NO, THIS IS  JUST FOR US WORKERS. THERE´S SOME BAD NEWS, TOO. SINCE I´LL BE ON CAMERA  BEHIND THE PRESIDENT, THE POWERS BROTHERS WANT ME  TO LOOK MORE RESPECTABLE.

 THEY´RE MAKING ME  CUT MY HAIR. OH, NO. WHAT AM I GOING  TO HOLD ONTO? NOT MY LUNCH. FOR 15 YEARS, I HAD  TO KEEP MY HAIR SHORT SO MY HEAD WOULDN´T GET SUCKED  IN THE PUNCH PRESS. BUT I´M A MANAGER NOW,  AND THIS HAIR SAYS THAT I PLAY  BY MY OWN RULES. I MIGHT PLAY GUITAR.  YOU DON´T KNOW ME. HONEY, THAT´S OKAY. ´CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT´S SEXIER  THAN A GUY WITH LONG HAIR? A GUY WITH SHORT HAIR WHO  IS GOING TO MEET THE PRESIDENT. YOU´RE TALKING  ABOUT ME, RIGHT? HEY. AS LONG AS YOU´RE  GETTING THINGS CUT, WHY DON´T YOU DO SOMETHING  ABOUT THAT SKID MARK ON YOUR CHIN? I´LL SHAVE MINE  WHEN YOU SHAVE YOURS. I BETTER GO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT  WITH MY MAN LIONEL. OH, HEY, HEY, DON´T CALL HIS  BARBERSHOP. IT´S CLOSED DOWN. HE´S CUTTING HAIR OVER  AT MY BEAUTY SALON NOW. OH, GREAT. NOW I GOTTA SIT  AROUND LA CASA DE COIFFURES AND LISTEN TO OLD BATS  TALKING ABOUT HOW "ERIK ESTRADA --  HE STILL LOOKS GOOD." HEY, WHAT DOES  THIS JUNK DO? THAT HIDES BLEMISHES. YOU GOT ANYTHING  THAT WILL HIDE 30 YEARS OF SMOKE  AND TEQUILA BACK SPLASH? THE LA MARIE PAPER BAG? COME ON,  I NEED SOME NEW MAKEUP. YOU KNOW,  THE PRESIDENT´S COMING... YOU DON´T CARE  ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. OH, MY GOD. YOU´VE GOT A MAN! SHUT UP. COME ON. SPILL IT. WHO IS HE,  AND WHERE´D YOU MEET HIM? COME ON, TELL ME. ALL RIGHT,  HIS NAME IS RANDY. HE WORKS THE FORKLIFT  AT THE FACTORY. IS IT SERIOUS? WOULD I BE ASKING YOU ABOUT  THIS WHORE PAINT IF IT WASN´T? BENNY, I AM SO HAPPY  FOR YOU. I THINK IT´S GREAT  WHEN TWO PEOPLE YOUR AGE -- MY AGE? I DON´T THINK SO. RANDY IS 42. I DON´T WANT SOME OLD GUY WHERE FOREPLAY IS SOMEBODY  YELLING OUT "CLEAR!" AHEM. DO I LOOK GOOD  OR WHAT? YOU LOOK LIKE THE PIT BOSS  AT AN INDIAN CASINO. KIDS, GET OUT HERE! WHERE DID YOU GET  AN AMERICAN FLAG TIE? I BORROWED IT FROM ONE  OF MY BUDDIES AT WORK. HE´S A SIKH.  HE KEEPS IT IN THE LOCKER IN CASE  THERE´S A TERRORIST ATTACK. WHAT´S GOING ON, DAD? JUST THOUGHT YOU KIDS  MIGHT WANT TO SEE WHAT YOUR FATHER´S GOING  TO LOOK LIKE WHEN HE MEETS THE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES. WHAT? THAT´S RIGHT. GEORGE W. BUSH IS COMING  TO SPEAK AT THE FACTORY, AND I´LL BE STANDING  RIGHT NEXT TO HIM REPRESENTING! Y TODO.  I´M GOING TO BE LIKE THIS. I CAN´T BELIEVE YOU´RE EXCITED  ABOUT MEETING THE PRESIDENT. YOU DIDN´T EVEN VOTE  FOR HIM. HEY, HEY,  YOUNG LADY. I DIDN´T VOTE  FOR ANYBODY. THEN WHY DO YOU CARE  ABOUT MEETING HIM? DO YOU EVEN KNOW  WHERE I COME FROM? CARMEN, I USED TO SWIM  IN MY UNDERWEAR BECAUSE I COULDN´T AFFORD  A SWIMSUIT. AND NOW I´M GOING TO MEET  THE LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME. DAD, YOU STILL SWIM  IN YOUR UNDERWEAR. WELL, THAT´S MY CHOICE NOW. I WOULDN´T WANT  TO MEET A PRESIDENT WHO´S WASTING MONEY  ON BOMBS AND TANKS WHEN THERE ARE HUNGRY,  SICK PEOPLE OUT THERE. HEY, THAT WASTED MONEY  IS SPENT ON PLANES THAT I MAKE  AND THAT PUTS FOOD ON THIS TABLE. HOW CAN YOU SLEEP AT NIGHT  KNOWING YOU HELPED BOMB BABIES? CARMEN, CARMEN, WE DON´T  MAKE THE BOMBS. WE MAKE THE LANDING GEAR SO THE PLANES CAN COME BACK  AND RELOAD. READ THE SHIRT, DAD. WHAT? "SMART BOMBS ARE DUMB." WOW. I DIDN´T REALIZE HOW POWERFUL  A RHINESTONE T-SHIRT COULD BE. YOU DON´T KNOW WHAT  YOU´RE TALKING ABOUT, CARMEN, AND YOU DON´T GET WHAT  A GREAT COUNTRY THIS IS. WHERE ELSE CAN  A SECOND-GENERATION MEXICAN-AMERICAN FACTORY WORKER  WHO CAN´T NAME HIS CONGRESSMAN AND WHO IGNORES  ALL HIS JURY SUMMONS MEET THE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES? YOU KNOW WHAT, ANGIE?  NEXT TIME YOU BUY STAMPS, FORGET ABOUT LUCY AND DESI,  GET THE ONES WITH THE FLAGS. I´M READY! CARMEN, YOU DON´T KNOW  HOW GOOD YOU HAVE IT HERE. MY UNCLES ARE IN JAIL  IN CUBA BECAUSE THEY DARED  TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS. THAT´S NOT WHY  THEY´RE IN JAIL. I´M MAKING A POINT. OKAY, WELL, SINCE I CAN EXPRESS MYSELF,  I´M GOING DOWN TO THE FACTORY AND PROTEST  THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH. OH, YOU DO,  AND I´LL KILL YOU. GEORGE. NO, I´M SERIOUS.  I´LL KILL YOU. YOU BETTER NOT SHOW UP  AT THE FACTORY, CARMEN. SO, WHAT, I´M LIKE  A POLITICAL PRISONER NOW? THIS IS AMERICA, OKAY? PEOPLE  FOUGHT AND DIED FOR THAT RIGHT. I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID  WAR WAS WRONG. HI, BENNY. SYLVIA. OH, MY GOD,  IS THAT GEORGIE? WHAT´S IT BEEN,  25 YEARS? WHAT´S UP, SYLVIA? LAST TIME I SAW YOU,  YOU WERE CRYING. EVERY TIME I SAW YOU,  YOU WERE CRYING. BECAUSE EVERY TIME YOU SAW ME,  SHE WAS MY MOM. COME HERE,  LET ME LOOK AT YOU. SHE´S CALLING YOU.  I´M NOT GOING  OVER THERE. GO OVER THERE.  THAT´S YOUR FRIEND.  SHE AIN´T MY FRIEND. LOOK AT YOU.  YOU´RE ALL GROWN UP NOW. I HEARD YOU TRACKED DOWN  THAT DEADBEAT DAD OF YOURS AND DECKED HIM. DROPPED HIM  WITH ONE PUNCH. BUT THAT´S NOT SOMETHING  I´M PROUD OF. I JUST, YOU KNOW... HANDLED MY BUSINESS. GOOD FOR YOU. YOU STILL WET THE BED? YOU TOLD HER? I TELL EVERYBODY. THAT´S  HOW I BREAK THE ICE. GEORGE, WHAT´S UP, BROTHER? WHAT´S HAPPENING, LIONEL? ALL RIGHT. HEY, MAN, WHAT HAPPENED  TO YOUR SHOP? HEY, THIS IS GREAT.  BESIDES, THE PRICE WAS RIGHT, AND I GET A CHANCE  TO HANG OUT WITH ALL THE... BONITA SEÑORITAS. AND I GET A LITTLE TASTE  OF THAT EVERY NOW AND THEN. WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING  TODAY, BENNY? JUST A MANICURE  AND A READING. DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION  FOR THE TAROT? I WANT TO KNOW  IF IT´S GOING TO WORK OUT BETWEEN ME AND RANDY. I SEE OBSTACLES. THE FOOL CARD  IN THE PAST POSITION. THAT´S GEORGE. HE´S ALWAYS JEALOUS  OF THE GUYS I´VE DATED. IF I DIDN´T SLIP HIM  A LITTLE BOURBON IN HIS SIPPY CUP  NOW AND THEN, I NEVER WOULD´VE GONE OUT. DOES HE LIKE THE GUY? HE DOESN´T KNOW. YOU´VE GOT  TO TELL GEORGE. YEAH, WHAT IF I DON´T? IT´S THE DEATH CARD,  BENNY. IF YOU DON´T TELL HIM, YOUR RELATIONSHIP  WILL DIE. OH, WAIT, HOW DO I KNOW  THESE VOODOO CARDS ARE TALKING ABOUT ME? THE EMPRESS. THE NURTURING MOTHER. OH, MY GOD, THAT´S ME! HEY, GEORGE, I´M THINKING ABOUT DATING  AGAIN, SO GET USED TO IT. WHAT? WHO TOLD YOU THAT --  SYLVIA? GEORGE, I´M NOT KIDDING.  I´VE BEEN ALONE TOO LONG. MOM, WHERE ARE YOU GOING  TO FIND A GUY? OH, I DON´T KNOW. COME ON,  THERE´S ABOUT 50 GUYS TO PICK FROM AT THE PLANT. GEORGE, DON´T BE SURPRISED IF SOMEDAY I COME BACK  FROM BREAK WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE  AND MY DRESS ON BACKWARDS. NO, NO. NO GUYS FROM THE FACTORY. I DON´T WANT THIS  AFFECTING YOUR WORK. BESIDES,  YOU´RE FIVE YEARS AWAY FROM WEARING YOUR DRESS  BACKWARDS ANYWAYS. SO,  WHAT ARE WE DOING? OH, WELL, START CUTTING.  I´LL SAY WHEN. OH, NO, I´M NOT CUTTING  THAT BEAUTIFUL MANE. MAN, YOU HAVE TO. MY BOSSES WANT ME TO LOOK  MORE RESPECTABLE. HEY, LIONEL,  I´M MEETING PRESIDENT BUSH. ALL RIGHT. BUT I´M NOT DOING IT  FOR THE PRESIDENT. I´M DOING IT  FOR CONDOLEEZZA. ´CAUSE I´D LIKE TO GET  A LITTLE TASTE OF THAT. AND THANKS TO THE PEOPLE  OF POWERS AVIATION -- PEOPLE LIKE GEORGE LOPEZ AND BILL JOHNSON AND LaTONYA HARRIS. OUR NATION IS MORE SECURE  AND OUR WORLD MORE PEACEFUL. I THOUGHT I SAID  GET A HAIRCUT. I DID. IT LOOKS THE SAME. I CAN´T GO ANY SHORTER. THIS IS THE VOLUME I WANT  AND THE CONTROL THAT I NEED. SHH! HEY, IT WASN´T ME. THE PRESIDENT  JUST SHUSHED ME. SHH. I WISH I HAD A SIPPY CUP  OF BOURBON RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, WE DON´T HAVE  TO LISTEN TO THIS. I´VE GOT THE KEY  TO THE STORAGE CLOSET. GET OFF ME! I DON´T WANT  GEORGE TO SEE US. BENNY, I´VE KNOWN GEORGE  FOR A LONG TIME. YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE  I´M LYING TO HIM. NO. YOU´RE NOT LYING TO HIM.  I´M LYING TO HIM. HE´S USED TO THAT. BENNY, I CAN´T EVEN  DECORATE MY LOCKER WITH PICTURES OF YOU  GETTING ALL SOAPY WASHING MY TRUCK,  ´CAUSE GEORGE MIGHT SEE IT. I WANT THE GUYS  TO KNOW ABOUT THIS, SO THEY´LL STOP SAYING  BAD THINGS ABOUT YOU IN FRONT OF ME. YOU´RE SO SWEET. I´LL TELL HIM TOMORROW. I´D LIKE TO THANK JACK POWERS  FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY. NO MORE WAR! NO MORE WAR! NOT IN MY NAME,  MR. PRESIDENT! NOT IN MY NAME!  NO MORE WAR! SHAME ON YOU, MR. PRESIDENT!  SHAME, SHAME, SHAME! SHAME ON YOU!  SHAME, SHAME! WELL, THAT´S THE GREAT  THING ABOUT THIS NATION. YOU DON´T HAVE  TO AGREE WITH ME. GOD BLESS THE FOLKS  AT POWERS AVIATION, AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. DAMN IT, GEORGE, CAN´T  YOU CONTROL YOUR DAUGHTER? I TOLD HER  NOT TO COME DOWN HERE. THE SCHOOLS, DEMOCRACY,  MARTIN SHEEN -- IT´S ALL WORKING  AGAINST ME. GREAT SPEECH,  MR. PRESIDENT. I´M VERY SORRY  ABOUT THAT OUTBURST. WELL, THANKS  FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I´M SORRY, TOO, MR. PRESIDENT.  THAT WAS MY DAUGHTER. BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW  ABOUT CRAZY DAUGHTERS. THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT,  AMIGO. HEY, I´M THE GUY  YOU SHUSHED. WELL, OKAY, THEN,  THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT. OKAY. [ APPLAUSE ] LET´S GO. I HOPE MY MOM  HELD CARMEN IN THE PARKING LOT  FOR ME. HEY, WHOA, GEORGE.  CHECK IT OUT. THE PRESIDENT  LEFT HIS SPEECH. HE MENTIONED ME. MY NAME´S  IN THAT SPEECH. HEY, YOU COULD GIVE IT BACK TO HIM AND MAKE UP  FOR WHAT CARMEN DID. OR I COULD PUNISH THE HELL  OUT OF CARMEN AND KEEP THE SPEECH  AS A SOUVENIR. LET´S DO THAT. NO, YOU CAN´T DO THAT. THAT´S,  LIKE, GOVERNMENT PROPERTY. THEY PUT THAT STUFF IN  THE PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY. PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY? TRUST ME, IT´S NO BIG DEAL.  JUST BE CASUAL. PRETEND WE´RE HAVING  A CONVERSATI-- HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA! WHAT ARE WE  GOING TO TALK ABOUT -- LIKE MOVIES OR SPORTS? I´M NOT  GOOD UNDER PRESSURE, GEORGE. I CAN´T DO THIS.  DON´T MAKE ME DO THIS, GEORGE. FORGET IT.  I GOT THE SPEECH. OH, OKAY. HA HA. WE GOT A CODE 63  ON POTUS´ SPEECH. IT MEANS WE GO AFTER WHOEVER STOLE  THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH. COME ON, NEW GUY.  LEARN THE CODES! CARMEN! DON´T HURT HER.  I´M NOT HAVING ANOTHER ONE. WHAT THE HELL  WERE YOU THINKING? I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO STAY  AWAY FROM THE FACTORY. I OBEYED MY CONSCIENCE.  THE ONLY THING NECESSARY FOR THE TRIUMPH OF EVIL  IS FOR GOOD MEN TO DO NOTHING. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA  HOW ANNOYING YOU ARE RIGHT NOW? YOU KNOW WHAT?  YOU´RE GROUNDED. FOR A MONTH! THAT´S NOT FAIR! MOM, PLEASE,  YOU UNDERSTAND, RIGHT? I MEAN, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE  TO BREAK THE RULES TO STAND UP  FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN. CARMEN, WE LOVE THAT YOU ARE  THINKING FOR YOURSELF, BUT THERE IS A TIME  AND A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING. AND THAT TIME AND PLACE  IS NOT AT MY WORK. YOU COULD´VE JEOPARDIZED  MY JOB. YOU KNOW, MAYBE IF YOU´D  ACTUALLY LISTENED TO THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH,  YOU WOULD´VE LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT HONOR AND DIGNITY  AND HOW THIS COUNTRY IS STRONG BECAUSE OF THE QUIET DECENCY  OF WORKING PEOPLE. AND GOD BLESS THE FOLKS  AT POWERS AVIATION AND GOD BLESS AMERICA! WOW, YOU REALLY PAID ATTENTION  TO HIS SPEECH. NO, I STOLE IT. GEORGE,  YOU GET A CHANCE TO MEET THE PRESIDENT  OF THE UNITED STATES AND YOU STEAL SOMETHING  FROM HIM? HA HA HA. MY NAME´S IN IT.  YOU WANT TO SEE? HELL, YES. SO IT´S NOT OKAY FOR YOU  TO SPEAK YOUR MIND TO THE PRESIDENT, BUT IT´S OKAY  FOR YOU TO STEAL FROM HIM? HERE´S THE DIFFERENCE. HE DOESN´T KNOW  I STOLE IT. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] MAX, CAN YOU GET THE DOOR? I´M WITH THE SECRET SERVICE. ARE YOUR PARENTS HERE? I CAN´T LET STRANGERS  IN THE HOUSE. DO YOU HAVE I.D.? PLEASE GET YOUR PARENTS. ANYONE CAN MAKE  ONE OF THOSE. MY DAD HAS ONE THAT SAYS  HE´S A BIKINI INSPECTOR. GET YOUR PARENTS. HEY, DAD! THE SECRET SERVICE  IS HERE. YOU SEE?  THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MESS  WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA. GEORGE LOPEZ. SPECIAL AGENT SAUNDERS. LISTEN, I KNOW  WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE  FOR MY DAUGHTER, OKAY? SHE WAS WAY OUT OF LINE, AND SHE´LL NEVER  SPEAK OUT LIKE THAT AGAIN. YOU CAN SILENCE ME, BUT THERE ARE  MORE VOICES OUT THERE. THAT´S RIGHT,  IT ONLY TAKES ONE SNOWFLAKE TO START AN AVALANCHE. TAKE HER AWAY! ACTUALLY, I´M HERE ABOUT  THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH. IT´S BEEN STOLEN. A SPEECH, YOU SAY. THIS IS THE FIRST  I´VE HEARD OF IT. UM, WHY DON´T YOU KIDS  GO UPSTAIRS, HUH? UPSTAIRS, YOU SAY? WELL, IT´S THE FIRST  I´VE HEARD OF IT. GO. PLEASE. MR. LOPEZ, WE FIGURED SINCE  YOU WERE THE PLANT MANAGER, MAYBE YOU HEARD SOMEBODY  TALK ABOUT TAKING IT. OH... NO. DO YOU HAVE ANY LEADS? WELL, AFTER THE SPEECH,  ONE OF OUR MEN THOUGHT HE SAW  A LARGE MEXICAN WOMAN NEAR THE PODIUM. EXCUSE ME, UH, OFFICER, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN  TO THE PERSON WHO DID THIS IF THEY WERE CAUGHT? WELL, THAT SPEECH  IS FEDERAL PROPERTY. STEALING IT´S A FELONY. LOOK, IF YOU HEAR OF ANYTHING,  LET ME KNOW. NO PROBLEM. HEY, GOOD LUCK  TRYING TO FIND THE SPEECH. I DON´T NEED LUCK. MY SOLE MISSION  IS TO RETURN THAT SPEECH  TO THE WHITE HOUSE. EVENING. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? WHY DIDN´T YOU GIVE HIM  THE SPEECH BACK? COME ON, ANGIE,  YOU HEARD THE MAN. THEY GOT NOTHING! SECRET SERVICE.  [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] IN THE LAST MONTH,  I´VE PUNCHED OUT MY DAD... I GOT THE PRESIDENT´S  SPEECH. I THINK I´M FINALLY  TURNING THE CORNER HERE. SHOUT! SO NO ONE ELSE KNOWS  YOU STOLE IT? NOPE. JUST YOU GUYS  AND ERNIE. AND EVERY WOMAN  ERNIE´S TOLD. "HEY, MY BEST FRIEND  STOLE THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH. "WOULD YOU GO OUT WITH ME?  HEE HEE HEE. "OH, OKAY,  SORRY TO BOTHER YOU. HEE HEE HEE HEE." DUDE, WHAT´D YOU TELL  THE SECRET SERVICE? I DIDN´T  TELL THEM NOTHING. GOOD.  I THOUGHT YOU´D CRACK ONCE THEY STARTED QUESTIONING  YOU ABOUT THE SPEECH. THE SECRET SERVICE  IS GOING TO QUESTION ME ABOUT THE SPEECH?  SHH! I DON´T WANT THE PRESIDENT  MAD AT ME, GEORGE. I DON´T WANT TO GO  ON THAT DECK OF CARDS. ERNIE, RELAX. THEY GOT NOTHING,  ALL RIGHT? YOU GOT TO BE  MORE LIKE ME. BE COOL. ICE WATER. GEORGE, THESE GENTLEMEN  WANT TO TALK TO YOU. THE SPEECH IS AT MY HOUSE! IT´S IN A PLASTIC BAG  TAPED BEHIND THE TOILET! WE´RE NOT HERE  ABOUT A SPEECH. THEN WHY AM I BEING  ARRESTED? I DIDN´T DO ANYTHING! YOU´RE UNDER ARREST  FOR ASSAULTING YOUR FATHER -- MANNY LOPEZ. OKAY, I MIGHT HAVE  DONE THAT. THE ACTUAL IDEA FOR THE STORY,  THE SHOW YOU JUST SAW, ME TAKING  THE PRESIDENT´S SPEECH, HAPPENED IN REAL LIFE. I WAS INVITED TO PERFORM  AT THE WHITE HOUSE, AND PRESIDENT BUSH,  AFTER HE SPOKE, I LOOKED DOWN AT THE PODIUM,  AND THERE WAS THE SPEECH WITH MY NAME IN IT  Y TODO. SO I GRABBED IT,  I PUT IT IN MY POCKET, AND THE SECRET SERVICE  WAS LOOKING FOR ME. I SAID, "HOW DO THEY KNOW  I TOOK IT?" THEN THEY CAME UP TO ME  AND THEY SAID, "MR. LOPEZ?" AND I SAID, "IT´S IN THE CAR!" -- Captions by VITAC -- CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY ABC, INC.,  AND WARNER BROS. TELEVISION
