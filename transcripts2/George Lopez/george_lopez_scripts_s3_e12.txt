THAT WASN´T A CONVERSATION. "OOH, JASON, OOH, CARMEN. "LET´S BOTH GAG  ON THE COUNT OF THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE.  UGHHH! YOU ARE SO DEAD! I´M NOT SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU  THIS, BUT YOU´RE ADOPTED. AND WHEN YOU TURN 16, YOUR HEAD WILL EXPLODE JUST  LIKE YOUR REAL MOM´S DID! HEY!  HEY, HEY, HEY! WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING  DOWN HERE?! HE WAS LISTENING IN ON  MY PHONE CALL WITH JASON. MAX, I TOLD YOU  NO MORE EAVESDROPPING! IT DOESN´T HURT ANYBODY. IT VIOLATES THEIR PRIVACY. YOU KNOW WHAT?  CHRISTMAS IS COMING UP. I´M TEMPTED TO TELL SANTA  AND LET HIM DEAL WITH YOU. NO, PLEASE DON´T TELL SANTA.  I´LL STOP. I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT, BUT RIGHT NOW NO MORE VIDEO  GAMES FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK. OKAY, BUT PLEASE  DON´T TELL SANTA. [ TELEPHONE RINGS ] JASON? YES, IT´S JASON. LISTEN, YOU TALK  ON THE PHONE TOO MUCH. I DON´T LOVE YOU ANYMORE.  GET YOUR MOTHER! IT´S DAD. MY DAD. HI, HONEY. Hey, baby, listen. I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU BEFORE  YOU WENT TO GET MAX´S PRESENTS. HOLD ON A SECOND.  GO TO THE OTHER ROOM. I NEED TO TALK TO YOUR FATHER  IN PRIVATE. HO HO HO! WHEN DID YOU HAVE TIME  TO DO THE SHOPPING? I WENT ON MY LUNCH BREAK. I GOT MAX EVERYTHING  ON HIS LIST TO SANTA. Everything?  WELL, EVERYTHING  EXCEPT THE MONKEY. WE CAN JUST LOCK MY MOM  IN THE YARD, THROW SOME BANANAS OUT THERE,  AND WATCH HER THROUGH THE GLASS. HO HO HO! HAVE YOU BEEN NAUGHTY  OR NICE? SAVE IT, YOU BIG FAKE! NAUGHTY. NAUGHTY. NAUGHTY. UGH! [ INTRO TO WAR´S "LOW RIDER"  PLAYS ] ♫ ALL MY FRIENDS  KNOW THE LOW RIDER ♫ ♫ THE LOW RIDER  IS A LITTLE HIGHER ♫ LOOK, HONEY.  IT´S COMING UP TO US. D-DON´T FEED IT. IT´LL FOLLOW US HOME AND MAKE US  PAY FOR ITS WEDDING. HEY, CARMEN. HEY, JASON. HEY, JASON. HEY, JASON.  [ GIGGLES ] OKAY, YOU TWO.  BREAK IT UP. BUT WE´RE NOT DOING  ANYTHING WRONG. YOU KISS MOM IN FRONT OF PEOPLE  ALL THE TIME. THAT´S DIFFERENT, ALL RIGHT? WE´RE MARRIED.  IT MEANS NOTHING TO US. IF IT MEANS NOTHING TO YOU, THEN WHY DO YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES  AND LIFT YOUR LEG? YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN´T BE  KISSING AT WORK, ANYWAY. FINE, I WON´T DO IT HERE.  I´M ON BREAK. COME ON, J-MAC. A GIRL HER AGE SHOULD NOT DO  THAT STUFF IN FRONT OF PEOPLE. [ SCOFFS ] I THOUGHT HE OWNED A VAN.  WHAT´S HE WAITING FOR? I´M GONNA PUT A STOP  TO THIS. HONEY, HONEY, RELAX. I DON´T LIKE IT, EITHER, BUT CARMEN´S A TEENAGE GIRL  WITH A GREAT BOYFRIEND. SHE´S JUST TRYING TO SEND  A MESSAGE TO THE OTHER GIRLS THAT, "HE´S MINE." I THINK JASON´S BRAIN IS SENDING  THE MESSAGE TO HIS PANTS -- "MAKE ROOM." [ MUTTERING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I´M PLAYING THE VIDEO GAME.  NO, YOU´RE NOT. THAT´S YOUR PUNISHMENT  FOR EAVESDROPPING. YOU WANT ME TELL SANTA  YOU WERE DISOBEYING, NOW? YEAH, I DO. WHY DON´T YOU TELL  SANTA RIGHT NOW? HE´S SITTING RIGHT NEXT  TO YOU. WHAT?! I KNOW DAD. I HEARD YOU ON THE PHONE  WITH MOM. YOU´RE SANTA! COME ON, MAX.  YOU THINK I´M SANTA? YEAH! LOOK, I´M GONNA TELL  YOU SOMETHING. NO ONE LIKES TO SAY THIS  IN PUBLIC... But Santa Is white. IF A MEXICAN WAS DRIVING AROUND  WITH A BAGFUL OF PRESENTS, HE´D GET PULLED OVER  EVERY TWO SECONDS. GEORGE. "ALL RIGHT, HECTOR.  LET´S SEE THE RECEIPTS."  GEORGE! IT´S TIME WE TELL HIM  THE TRUTH. SANTA FOUND OUT YOU WERE  LISTENING IN ON PHONE CALLS, AND HE PUT YOU  ON THE NAUGHTY LIST. SO WE HAD TO BUY YOUR GIFTS. I´M YOUR MOTHER.  HAVE I EVERY LIED TO YOU? "SHOTS DON´T HURT." "IT DOESN´T MATTER  IF YOU WIN OR LOSE." "DYSLEXIA IS A GIFT!" [ THUMPING ] MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?  THAT BALL IS KEEPING ME UP. I´M TRYING TO STAY AWAKE. I´M GONNA SNEAK DOWNSTAIRS AND CATCH DAD PUTTING OUT  ALL THE GIFTS. [ THUMPING CONTINUES ] LOOK, WHAT IF IT´S NOT DAD,  HUH? WHAT IF IT REALLY IS SANTA?  YOU KNOW, HE IS PRETTY SNEAKY. YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE  TO HEAR HIM. OH, I´LL HEAR HIM. I PUT HABANERA SAUCE  IN THE COOKIES. IF SANTA TAKES ONE BITE, HE´LL FLY BACK TO THE NORTH POLE  ON HIS OWN BUTT POWER. BUT WHAT IF  THE WRONG PERSON EATS -- I THINK THAT´S A GREAT PLAN. George: I GOT HIM, ANGIE!  I GOT HIM! Angie:  GOOD, GOOD, GET HIM! OW!  HOLD HIM, GEORGE! HOLD HIM! HOLD HIM! WHAT´S HAPPENING? YOUR DAD CAUGHT SANTA CLAUS. REALLY?!  MM-HMM. DID YOU SEE HIM, MAX?  DID YOU SEE SANTA CLAUS? NO, HE WAS HERE? I HAD HIM BY THE BEARD  AND THE SEAT OF HIS PANTS, BUT HE BROKE OUT OF MY GRIP. HE´S QUICK, MAX. HE´S LIKE ONE OF THOSE BIG GUYS  THAT CAN MOVE LIKE JACK BLACK. YOU REALLY HAD HIM? YEAH.  AND THIS IS ALL THAT I GOT. LOOK, SON, I KNOW IT´S NOT THE  SAME AS SEEING SANTA CLAUS, BUT...YOU CAN HAVE IT...  IF YOU WANT. WOW, THIS HAS BEEN  ALL OVER THE WORLD. I BET ELVES MADE IT. YEAH,  I BET SOME LITTLE PEOPLE IN A CROWDED WORKSHOP  SOMEWHERE MADE THAT. THANKS, DAD.  THIS IS THE COOLEST THING EVER. OKAY, KIDS, THAT´S ENOUGH  EXCITEMENT FOR TONIGHT. EVERYBODY BACK TO BED, HUH? WAIT, WHY DON´T WE OPEN  THE PRESENTS NOW? I MEAN, SANTA JUST LEFT THEM.  THEY´RE FRESH. NO, WE HAVE TO WAIT  TILL TOMORROW MORNING. HEY, CAN I OPEN ONE OF MY CDs?  I CAN LISTEN TO IT TONIGHT. WHO SAID  YOU WERE GETTING CDs? HUH? THIS COULD BE THAT DIAMOND  NECKLACE YOU ASKED SANTA FOR. [ RATTLING ] OH, MY GOD!  [ SQUEALS ] GO TO BED.  GO...TO BED. DAD... DO YOU THINK SANTA KNOWS  THAT I DIDN´T BELIEVE? NO, DON´T EVEN WORRY  ABOUT IT, SON. GOOD NIGHT. MY MAN. YEAH, THAT´S RIGHT. HANG ON, SANTA. FAT MAN TRIES TO SLIDE DOWN  MY CHIMNEY, I DON´T THINK SO. TAKE ON THE EASTER BUNNY,  TAMBIéN -- THE TOOTH FAIRY,  OLD MAN KWANZAA. CALL THEM.  I´LL BE RIGHT HERE. YOU´VE BEEN SO GOOD  ABOUT WATCHING WHAT YOU EAT. YEAH, YOU´RE RIGHT. I´LL GO GET YOU A RICE CAKE. RICE CAKE?  THAT LOCO RICE CAKE? OH, MY GOD! HOT! HOT! WHEN SANTA GOT AWAY,  MY DAD GOT ME THIS. IT´S GONNA BE IN A MUSEUM  SOME DAY. THAT´S THE DUMBEST THING  I´VE EVER HEARD, LOPEZ. YOU KNOW, IT DOESN´T HURT  WHEN MY TEACHER SAYS IT, AND IT DOESN´T HURT  WHEN YOU SAY IT. YOUR DAD´S FULL OF CRAP. HE JUST DID IT TO KEEP YOU  BELIEVING IN SANTA. NO, HE DIDN´T!  YOU GOT PUNKED, DUDE. GIVE ME THAT! MAKE ME. YOU KNOW, THIS IS DANGEROUSLY  CLOSE TO NAUGHTY! YOU KNOW, I WAS GETTING  A LITTLE JEALOUS WATCHING YOU PLAY  FOOTBALL TODAY. WHY IS THAT? BECAUSE ALL THE OTHER PLAYERS  WERE SLAPPING YOU ON YOUR BUTT. BY THE WAY, GOOD GAME. I´M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS AND PUT ON THAT SWEATER  YOU GOT ME FOR CHRISTMAS. OKAY. JASON, OUTSIDE. HAVE A SEAT. WHAT´S GOING ON? LOOK, I´M HAPPY THAT YOU CARE  ABOUT MY DAUGHTER. BUT WHENEVER I SEE YOU KISSING  OR TOUCHING OR HOLDING HER, I SEE ME CHOKING, KILLING,  AND BURYING YOU. LISTEN, I´M NOT INTO PUBLIC  AFFECTION, EITHER, ALL RIGHT? IT´S EMBARRASSING. BUT, COME ON, YOU KNOW WHAT IT  WAS LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL. GIRLS, THEY JUST WANT  TO HANG ALL OVER YOU. YEAH,  THAT´S WHAT IT WAS LIKE... NONSTOP KISSING. GIRLS KISSING ME. YEAH, THAT WAS IT. MR. LOPEZ,  WHAT AM I GONNA DO? I MEAN, I WANT TO STOP, BUT I DON´T WANT TO HURT  CARMEN´S FEELINGS. YOU KNOW,  IF ONLY WE COULD FIND SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO HURT  CARMEN´S FEELINGS. OH, FORGET IT.  I´LL JUST DO IT! REALLY?  YEAH. YOU KNOW,  SHE MAY GET MAD AT ME. SHE MAY EVEN, GOD FORBID,  STOP TALKING TO ME. THANKS, MR. LOPEZ. NEXT TIME  YOU GUYS GET TOGETHER, GET CARMEN TO START ALL  THAT KISSING AND STUFF, OKAY? AND I´LL TAKE CARE OF IT. GEORGE,  I NEED YOU IN HERE! LATER. WHAT HAPPENED? KENNY TOLANTINO SAID YOU  TRICKED ME ABOUT SANTA CLAUS, EVEN AFTER I SHOWED HIM  THE BEARD AND THE PIECE OF SANTA´S SUIT. SO HE HIT YOU? UH-HUH. WHEN I WOULDN´T SAY  THERE WASN´T A SANTA, HE KNOCKED ME DOWN  AND STARTED PUNCHING ME. YOU DIDN´T DO ANYTHING? I MADE HIM BLEED. I MOVED MY HEAD,  AND HE PUNCHED THE SIDEWALK. YOU KNOW,  THAT NEVER WORKED FOR ME. I WOULD MOVE MY HEAD, AND THEY WOULD JUST PUNCH  ANOTHER PART OF MY HEAD. HE SAYS HE´S GONNA BEAT ME UP  EVERY DAY AFTER SOCCER UNTIL I ADMIT  THERE´S NO SANTA. HOW MANY MORE SOCCER GAMES  DO YOU HAVE? HONEY.  MAYBE IT´S TIME. NO. LOOK, MAX, YOU DON´T  LISTEN TO THAT KID, OKAY? HE DOESN´T KNOW  WHAT HE´S TALKING ABOUT. MAX, GO UPSTAIRS  AND GET CLEANED UP, HUH? KEEP IT ON YOUR EYE,  AND I´LL BE UP IN A MINUTE. GO ON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU WANT HIM  TO GET BEAT UP EVERY DAY? NO, ANGIE, I DON´T WANT HIM  TO GET BEAT UP EVERY DAY, BUT I´M NOT GONNA LET SOME BULLY  RUIN SANTA CLAUS FOR MY SON. WHEN I WAS A KID, MY MOM DIDN´T GIVE A CRAP  ABOUT CHRISTMAS. THERE WAS NO MAGIC.  THERE WAS NO WONDER, NOTHING. YOU KNOW WHAT SHE WOULD DO? EVERY CHRISTMAS SHE´D MAKE  TAMALES. YOU KNOW WHY? SO ON CHRISTMAS MORNING  I HAD SOMETHING TO UNWRAP. IS IT A PUPPY?! NO, IT´S PORK. ALL RIGHT, I GET IT. I´LL LOOK IN  THE STUDENT REGISTRY AND E-MAIL THIS  KENNY KID´S PARENTS. NO, ANGIE -- NOT ONE OF YOUR  STRONGLY WORDED E-MAILS. YOUR WORDS  ARE LIKE BULLETS, NO. THERE OUGHT TO BE A WAITING  PERIOD ON YOUR KEYBOARD. WE CAN´T JUST DO NOTHING. RELAX,  I GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT. IN 20 SECONDS?  TRUST ME. HONEY. ANGIE... [ Shrilly ]  I GOT THIS! HEY, SANTA´S LITTLE HELPER. SAY HE´S NOT REAL  OR YOU´RE GOING DOWN. I SEE YOU HAVE BAND-AIDS  ON YOUR KNUCKLES. YOU MIGHT WANT TO REMEMBER  WHERE YOU GOT THOSE. SAY IT, LOPEZ. SANTA ISN´T REAL. NO!  MY DAD WOULDN´T LIE. I GUESS YOU´RE JUST GONNA HAVE  TO LEARN THE HARD WAY. HO HO HO! PUNCH IT, RUDOLPH! I´M AN ELF! [ TIRES SCREECH ] HEY! HEY, MR. LOPEZ. WHAT´S GOING ON?  NOTHING. WE´RE JUST LOOKING  FOR A MOVIE TO SEE. OH, YEAH, LET ME SEE  THAT SPORTS PAGE. OH, YOUR HAIR SMELLS SO GOOD...  LIKE...PEACHES... [ GIGGLES ] ...THAT SMELL GOOD. YOU KNOW THAT I ONLY WANT MY  HEAD TO SMELL GOOD FOR YOU. [ GIGGLES ] OH, OH, OH! OKAY, THAT´S ENOUGH! WHAT IS IT, MR. LOPEZ? LOOK, I´M TIRED OF ALL  THIS PUBLIC AFFECTION. IT´S GOT TO STOP! BUT WE´RE NOT DOING  ANYTHING WRONG. WE´RE JUST SHOWING  THAT WE LIKE EACH OTHER, DAD. I REALLY LIKE PIZZA, BUT YOU DON´T SEE ME RUBBING IT  ALL OVER MY CHEST AND STICKING IT  IN MY BACK POCKETS. LOOK, CARMEN, I´M YOUR FATHER,  AND I MAKE THE RULES. NO MORE KISSING!  NO MORE TOUCHING! THAT IS SO HARSH,  MR. LOPEZ! END OF DISCUSSION! [ NO AUDIO ] BUT, DAD, THIS SUCKS! THIS IS GONNA BE SO HARD  FOR ME. BECAUSE WHEREVER WE ARE, I ALWAYS WANT TO HAVE YOU KISS  ME OR CALL ME HONEY BUNNY. IT´S TOO BAD. HEY, WE CAN STILL DO  ALL THOSE THINGS, JUST NOT IN FRONT OF MY DAD. LET´S GO DOWN TO THE MALL. WE CAN GO BY THE FOUNTAIN  AND ESKIMO KISS. THE NOSE THING? YES, HONEY BUNNY. OH, THIS IS SO HOT. I JUST RAN AN ERRAND  WITH ERNIE.  OKAY. IT´S THE TRUTH.  THAT´S WHERE I WAS. CALL HIM.  HE´LL TELL YOU THE SAME THING. I KNOW IT WAS YOU, DAD. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? KENNY TRIED TO BEAT ME UP  TODAY, AND SOME GUY DRESSED  AS SANTA CLAUS PUSHED HIM INTO THE BUSHES. NO, MAX. THAT COULDN´T HAVE BEEN  YOUR FATHER BECAUSE, AS AN ADULT, HE KNOWS  IT´S ILLEGAL TO ASSAULT A MINOR AND THAT,  [Shrilly] "I GOT THIS!" ISN´T A DEFENSE  IN A COURT OF LAW. I KNOW IT WAS YOU, DAD. ALL RIGHT, MAX.  SIT DOWN. YOU´RE OLD ENOUGH. I GUESS IT´S TIME  WE HAD THIS TALK. DON´T TALK TO ME.  TALK TO SANTA. HE´S THE ONE  THAT´S GONNA BE MAD AT YOU. YOU CAN´T JUST DRESS UP LIKE HIM  AND GO PUSHING KIDS INTO BUSHES! FIRST, YOU TEAR HIS COAT,  AND THEN THIS? WHAT SCARES ME THE MOST  IS YOU´RE NOT EVEN THINKING! YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU´RE RIGHT. I´M SORRY. AND I´LL WRITE A LETTER  TONIGHT TO SANTA AND EXPLAIN THE WHOLE THING. THANK YOU. OH, AND NEXT YEAR, TELL  SANTA LESS SOCKS, MORE MONKEY. AM I GOOD OR WHAT? I CAN MAKE ANYBODY  BELIEVE ANYTHING -- MAX, CARMEN, YOU. YOU DON´T LIE TO ME ANYMORE. I LIE TO YOU BEFORE I EVEN KNOW  WHAT I´M SAYING. MY LIES ARE BACKED UP LIKE  PLANES WAITING TO TAKE OFF. "I LOVE TO GO SHOE SHOPPING  WITH YOU." "YOUR STORIES ABOUT WORK  ARE FASCINATING." "YOU KNOW, THIS HOUSE COULD USE  SOME MORE CANDLES." THERE GOES ONE NOW. I´M REAL! HO HO HO HO HO! [ SLEIGH BELLS JINGLING ] ANGIE! ANGIE! ANGIE! WHAT?  WHAT IS IT?  HE WAS HERE. WHO?  SANTA! HE PUSHED ME IN THE BUSHES,  AND THEN HE DISAPPEARED! MAX IS UPSTAIRS.  YOU DON´T HAVE TO DO THIS. LOOK, I´M TELLING YOU  IT WAS THE REAL SANTA. I´M GONNA GO MAKE YOU  SOME COFFEE. I´M NOT DRUNK! WHERE´D SANTA GO? YOU NEVER LEAVE A MAN BEHIND! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY ABC, INC.,  AND WARNER BROS.
