Surrender, are you kiddin'? thump thump thump Gosh, Big Fats got his lumps from an itty-bitty ant. I can't believe it. I don't believe it. No itty-bitty ant can treat Big Fats Dynamo 'like that and get away with it.' I'll haul off and squish him good with this hammer. Hold still, Atom Ant. This is the moment of truth. I got him. I got him. Boy, I mashed him to a mish. I'm afraid I'm going to have to hammer a little sense into his hard head. I did it with my own little atom smasher. Ha ha ha. What the..

Every time I open my big mouth I put my foot in it. Are you guys gonna just stand there and watch a guy get swished? No, Big Fats. We're gonna close our eyes. (Big Fats) 'Yeow!' I'm sick and tired of being a nice guy. From now on, I'm going to get nasty. What do you say, Fats? Maybe we ought to give ourselves up, huh? I ought to wash your mouth out with soap for saying such a nasty thing. This world ain't big enough for me and that Atom Ant. I'm gonna challenge him to a showdown. Okay, Mr. Dynamo. I accept your challenge. Show me down. I'm giving you two minutes to get out of town. Pardon me for being nosy. Hold it, Atom Ant. That's stretching things a little too far. slap How'd you like a rap on the schnozzle, like this. Well, that about wraps up the case of Big Fats. Gosh, Fats, you look kind of funny. Are you alright?
