 Greetings, bossnic. I caught the first plane I could get, when I got your antnigram. (Big Boss) Now, have you got your duty clear, Annie? Got you, bossnic. When you and your partner raid the Treasury Building, I keep Atom Ant busy. Mm-hmm, it'll be cinchnic. Now let's drop Annie off, in Antsville. [laughing] Mmm, my, what clean surroundings. Much like at homenic. [telephone ringing] (Annie on phone) 'Hello, Atom.' She. Who is this? Why, Atom.. ...this is Anastasia Antnic. We were in school together. We were? He-he-he. T-That's funny, I can't recall any exchange students in my class. Oh, you mean my accent, darling. I picked that up in my travels abroad. He-he. Gee, I would like to see you again, Annie. Uh, uh, um-um, but I am on duty. But, Atom, just for a little while. Hmm? Va-va-va-vroom. Atom Ant, up and at 'em. swoosh I'll expect you shortly, then. Even shortlier. [giggles] Uh, come on, Annie I'll buy you a sugar cube float for old times. Oh, how sweetnic. (Big Boss) By now Atom Ant is caught in Annie's spell. (Knuckles) Are you sure, boss? (Big Boss) 'Just leave things to me, Knuckles.' I'm so sure of this plan. We'll go right in the front doors. [glass shatters] Boy, you sure are sure, boss. And that's for sure. [intense music] Hey, someone has broken into the Treasury Building. You don't say. Well, that's gonna be just too bad for them. Calling Atom Ant, Police Headquarters calling Atom Ant. 'Someone has broken into' 'the Treasury Building. We need you.' 'Hurry, Atom. This is an emergency.' [instrumental music] Say, Annie, uh, would you mind if I have the music turned down? I think I'm getting a message. (male #1 on radio) 'Calling Atom Ant.' 'Help, Atom Ant.' Oh, now, Atom, forget yourself. Let's enjoy our reunion. Well.. He-he. Uh, maybe I was just hearing things. Of course, darling. I don't get it, Atom Ant should've answered our call by now. Well, call out the force. Somebody's got to get over to the Treasury Building. I got news for you. We are the force, just you and me. And one broken down police car. That's what the city gets for putting so much faith in an ant. An amusement park. Let's go, Atom. Well, uh, uh, wait, I thought sure I heard a police car siren. [siren wailing continues] Come, Knuckles, I believe we have sufficient supply of funds with which to leave the country. Yeah, boss, we're loaded. Uh, that is I am. [siren wailing continues] Well, well, I haven't seen that police car in years. 'Greetings, officers.' What you all shook up about? Out on a case, boys? Alright, you guys. Reach, all six of you. [laughing] Now, don't tell me you think you're gonna stop me in your condition. Uh, don't make me laugh boys. Ta-ta. They're all trying to escape. Com-mence fir-ing. [gunfire] Come on, Knuckles, those guys couldn't hit anything in their shaky shape. They sure come close though. [engine revving] Oh, Atom, isn't this thrillingnic? Uh-huh, but, golly, Annie, it's-it's after 12 midnight. It is? Oh, my goodness. - I'm-I'm on overtimenic. - Huh? So long, Atom, it's been nice. Girls, gee. Well, I guess I better check in at police headquarters just in case they wonder where I've been. swoosh Where've you been, Atom? About a million guys robbed the Treasury Building. The Treasury Building? Oh, no! Uh, wait, fellas. Maybe it's not too late. - Which way did they go? - It's too late. They're probably at the airport by now taking off for points unknown. The airport, eh? Why, if I hurry, maybe Atom Ant up and at 'em. [instrumental music] Come on, Knuckles, step on it. - Coming, boss. - Hey, bossnic. Wait for me. Are you kiddin'? Get lost. Start her up, Knuckles. Oh, boy, now which plane? Oh, Atom Antnic, over here. Huh. Well, thanks, Annie. I see 'em. screech - Yeow! - Yikes! You boys wanna plane ride, eh? Well, I'll give you one. whoosh [glass shatters] Looks like Atom Ant has done it again. I had a feeling we'd land in jail. So, that's it, Atom. I'm just no goodnic too. Arrest me. Oh, forget it, Annie. After all, I kinda fell for you. Oh, you sweetheartnic. Mm-hmm. Ya-hoo! Did I ever fall? 'Atom Ant' up and at 'em.
