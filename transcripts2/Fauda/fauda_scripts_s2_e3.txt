You expect me ‫‫to report to you before every operation?! ‫‫I guess we don't agree on ‫‫how a commander should behave. ‫‫Stop busting my balls, Naor. ‫‫Fine. ‫‫Let me make this easy for you: I'm out. ‫‫-Cut the drama... ‫‫-No drama. ‫‫Everyone here is insane, including you. ‫‫I don't want this anymore, enough. ‫‫Have you calmed down? ‫‫Let's take a dip in the spring, ‫‫it'll do you good. ‫‫Come on in! ‫‫You'll feel refreshed for the Sabbath. ‫‫Forget it, Dad. ‫‫You're crazy, I swear. ‫‫Wow! ‫‫You don't know what you're missing. ‫‫Well? ‫‫What's eating you up? ‫‫Any leads on Al Makdasi? ‫‫-The unit is working on it. ‫‫-And? ‫‫Performing searches, arrests, ‫‫following protocol. ‫‫You know, ‫‫when you were in 9th grade, ‫‫I traveled to Greece. ‫‫You didn't speak to me afterwards ‫‫because instead of a week, ‫‫I stayed for three. ‫‫It was in 8th grade, ‫‫and I didn't speak to you ‫‫because you left Mom by herself ‫‫during a holiday. ‫‫I wasn't in Greece. ‫‫I was in a Jordanian prison. ‫‫What? ‫‫They locked me up over the dumbest thing. ‫‫I had the perfect cover story, ‫‫could've been released the next day, ‫‫but Israel didn't want to ruin ‫‫ongoing talks with Jordan, ‫‫so they left me there ‫‫for more than two weeks. ‫‫I'm not telling you this ‫‫to sound like a hero, ‫‫I just want you to know ‫‫that the government doesn't ‫‫really care about your well-being. ‫‫They're all sons of bitches. ‫‫You're on your own, Doron. ‫‫Whatever you need done, do it yourself. ‫‫NABLUS, BALATA REFUGEE CAMP ‫‫[Get the door.] ‫‫[Peace be upon you.] ‫‫[-Enjoy your meal.] ‫‫[-Thanks.] ‫‫[-Why are you here?] ‫‫[-They've arrested Samir.] ‫‫[I know.] ‫‫[Anything else?] ‫‫[Doron and his goons took him away ‫‫right in front of his wife.] ‫‫[Nidal, what do you want?] ‫‫[-I want you to connect me with Abed.] ‫‫[-Which Abed?] ‫‫[Abed from the cyber unit. ‫‫Take me to him.] ‫‫[Nobody talks to those guys but me. ‫‫Not even the leadership.] ‫‫[Have a seat.] ‫‫[Walid, I beg you.] ‫‫[I want to get to Doron. ‫‫I want his address,] ‫‫[-his phone number, everything.] ‫‫[-First of all, calm down.] ‫‫[Pressuring me won't get you far.] ‫‫[I will operate whenever and wherever ‫‫Hamas decides,] ‫‫[not based on my own whims ‫‫and certainly not on yours.] ‫‫[But we both know ‫‫what that scum did to me.] ‫‫[And to you.] ‫‫[Nidal, what are you trying to tell me?] ‫‫[Nothing.] ‫‫[Good. Then drop it.] ‫‫[Have they released Shirin?] ‫‫[Praise God.] ‫‫[Praise God.] ‫‫[Did she talk?] ‫‫[Listen, Abu Seif Al Makdasi,] ‫‫[Nidal,] ‫‫[I don't know how they discipline you ‫‫back in Syria,] ‫‫[but here you'd better ‫‫weigh your words before you speak.] ‫‫[I think you're confused.] ‫‫[Here you can't just do as you please. ‫‫There's no room for anarchy.] ‫‫[I'm your commander, ‫‫and you will follow orders.] ‫‫[Understood?] ‫‫[Open the door.] ‫‫Just tell Eli you didn't mean it, ‫‫that you were upset and you're sorry. ‫‫-You don't have to leave. ‫‫-I want to leave. ‫‫So that's it? You're leaving and he stays? ‫‫I can't stay in a place ‫‫that operates this way. ‫‫You're such a jerk! ‫‫Give Eli a chance, he was rushed ‫‫in here from England. He'll be great. ‫‫Gimme a break, Eli is Doron's puppet. ‫‫It's gonna end badly. ‫‫You should leave, too. ‫‫You don't have to be ‫‫an intelligence officer again. ‫‫Why not be a fighter in a different unit? ‫‫Naor, I'm not leaving. ‫‫Naor! ‫‫Sleep on it for a few days. ‫‫I already have. ‫‫I'm through with this place. ‫‫Fuck everybody. ‫‫Take care of yourself. ‫‫[Doctor!] ‫‫[What is it?] ‫‫[-What happened to her?] ‫‫[-She fell on the pavement.] ‫‫[Bring her inside.] ‫‫[-Oh, God...] ‫‫[-Thank you.] ‫‫[Thank you.] ‫‫[Walid...] ‫‫[I couldn't sleep all night. ‫‫I had to see you.] ‫‫[-Are you alright?] ‫‫[-Yes. They didn't harm me.] ‫‫[They just asked if I know where you are.] ‫‫[And?] ‫‫[I told them the truth, ‫‫that I don't know.] ‫‫[You are my life.] ‫‫[They think you were behind ‫‫the attack at the bus station] ‫‫[and the bomb that killed ‫‫their undercover Unit Commander.] ‫‫[You shouldn't have come. ‫‫They're around here for sure.] ‫‫[I wanted to see you.] ‫‫[Tell me, what did you tell them?] ‫‫[I just told you.] ‫‫[Tell me exactly what happened, ‫‫word for word.] ‫‫[They asked if I know where you are,] ‫‫[I told them I didn't. ‫‫They know very well that I don't know,] ‫‫[-I didn't even have to tell them that.] ‫‫[-And that's it?] ‫‫[That's all you said ‫‫in a five-hour interrogation?] ‫‫[Yes, I believe that was pretty much it.] ‫‫[Did you recognize ‫‫any of the interrogators?] ‫‫[It was a woman.] ‫‫[Only a woman?] ‫‫[There were a few of them.] ‫‫[-Captain Ayub?] ‫‫[-Yes. He was there.] ‫‫[-Was Doron there?] ‫‫[-Who?] ‫‫[Doron.] ‫‫[A woman and Captain Ayub, no one else.] ‫‫[Where are you going, what's wrong?] ‫‫[I don't like your tone of voice.] ‫‫[Why is your guy following me?] ‫‫[-Who, Jihad? At the hospital?] ‫‫[-Yes.] ‫‫[-He's protecting you from trouble.] ‫‫[-What trouble?] ‫‫[Trouble.] ‫‫[Here at home, no one will harm you,] ‫‫[but at the hospital, one of my "friends"] ‫‫[could try to hurt you just to get to me.] ‫‫[Come on, Shirin, ‫‫I'm doing this because I love you.] ‫‫It's boiling hot in here, turn on the AC. ‫‫There's no air. ‫‫Any unusual activity last night? ‫‫Anyone going in or out? ‫‫One elderly woman went in, probably ill. ‫‫Let me see. ‫‫Freeze the frame. ‫‫It was 1:00 a.m., ‫‫doesn't that seem unusual? ‫‫I don't know what they consider unusual. ‫‫Why didn't you guys alert anyone?! ‫‫Replay it. ‫‫Pause. ‫‫Zoom in. ‫‫More. ‫‫Look at the shoe. ‫‫Play the exit footage. ‫‫Pause. Zoom in. ‫‫It's Walid. ‫‫That son of a bitch. ‫‫Send it to me, and wake up. Wake up! ‫‫Well? ‫‫It's gonna take a while. ‫‫He's not cracking. ‫‫We don't have much time. ‫‫The state attorney just announced ‫‫we have 48 hours. ‫‫Are you serious? ‫‫Damn it, I can't work like this. ‫‫Where's Samir's phone? ‫‫[Your phone.] ‫‫[Pardon me.

You're not ‫‫installing the camera. Steve will. ‫‫-Don't you trust me? ‫‫-I trust you blindly. ‫‫But I don't want to get you ‫‫into problematic situations. ‫‫-And installing a camera is problematic? ‫‫-Drop it, Doron. ‫‫Steve will do it and that's that. ‫‫Fine. ‫‫[Hello, Marwa.] ‫‫[Hello.] ‫‫[How are you?] ‫‫[I'm alright.] ‫‫[But for God's sake, help Samir.] ‫‫[He's not like you, ‫‫he can't take the heat.] ‫‫[-Why does everyone keep saying that?] ‫‫[-Because he's different from you, Nidal.] ‫‫[I hope there'll be more next time.] ‫‫[Thank you.] ‫‫[And...] ‫‫[I also got you ‫‫some orange-flavored chocolate.] ‫‫[You're the only person I know ‫‫who likes this stuff.] ‫‫[I remember you as a kid, ‫‫can you believe it?] ‫‫[You were so pretty, God bless you.] ‫‫[Samir and I would look at you...] ‫‫[while you'd eat that awful ‫‫orange-flavored chocolate of yours.] ‫‫[More importantly, ‫‫what's your plan to get him out of there?] ‫‫[Right now my hands are tied.] ‫‫[But they'll release him ‫‫because they've got nothing on him.] ‫‫[He's strong, praise God, ‫‫he can take it.] ‫‫[Really? Can he? ‫‫Does this look like he can take it?] ‫‫[Who is it?] ‫‫[Walid sent me. Open up.] ‫‫[I don't know anything about this.] ‫‫[I'm telling you I work with Walid. ‫‫Open up!] ‫‫[Walid would've told me to expect you.] ‫‫[I won't talk to you nor to anyone else.] ‫‫[If you don't want to open up, don't. ‫‫But you'll suffer the consequences.] ‫‫[Get in here.] ‫‫[Sit down.] ‫‫[I need someone's address, ‫‫phone number and everything about him.] ‫‫[Listen, I have no idea who you are ‫‫and it seems like you don't know] ‫‫[-who you're talking to.] ‫‫[-I don't?

Are we clear?! ‫‫He'd better not do anything stupid. ‫‫I'm inside. ‫‫Doron, we want to know ‫‫if he's hiding anything in there. ‫‫Doron, what's the status? ‫‫Two minutes. ‫‫There's nothing here. ‫‫Doron, just install the camera. ‫‫We don't have much time. ‫‫She's approaching from the east. ‫‫Doron, forget the camera and get out! ‫‫How close is she? ‫‫100 meters. ‫‫90 meters. ‫‫80 meters. ‫‫70 meters. ‫‫60 meters. ‫‫50 meters. ‫‫40 meters. ‫‫30 meters. ‫‫20 meters. ‫‫Doron, get out, now! ‫‫Doron, she's coming in!
