 ‫‫Listen up. ‫‫The attack occurred two hours ago. ‫‫Sadly, one soldier was killed, ‫‫he was in the wrong place ‫‫at the wrong time. ‫‫But he heroically took down ‫‫one of the terrorists. ‫‫Our security cam footage shows that ‫‫this squad was there a few days ago, ‫‫probably practicing. They spoke Hebrew. ‫‫Fluent enough to pass the checkpoint. ‫‫It looks like Al Makdasi. ‫‫Why they pulled over is unclear. ‫‫The body was ID'd as Bilal Abu Hassan, ‫‫a student at Birzeit University. ‫‫He was a member of Al-Kutla, ‫‫the Hamas' student association. ‫‫Damn it, ‫‫so now these assholes speak Hebrew? ‫‫-That's our working premise. ‫‫-Damn it... ‫‫Any recordings? ‫‫-How fluent is their Hebrew? ‫‫-It's unclear. ‫‫The Secret Service says ‫‫they study Hebrew at universities. ‫‫Let me make this clear: ‫‫They're no amateurs. ‫‫We've never dealt with this before, ‫‫it's a whole new level of sophistication: ‫‫"Jewish impostors." ‫‫Wait, I'm not done. ‫‫I want to discuss ‫‫what happened in the village. ‫‫I specifically ordered who goes inside ‫‫the house, so what happened? ‫‫-What happened? You know what happened. ‫‫-I went inside. ‫‫I installed the camera. ‫‫What's the problem? ‫‫What's the problem? It wasn't your job, ‫‫I was very clear about that. ‫‫-But I got the job done, didn't I? ‫‫-Do you know what "orders" are? ‫‫-Do you know what using good judgment is? ‫‫-Don't tell me about good judgment. ‫‫Fine, I apologize, it won't happen again. ‫‫Can I go now? ‫‫-Yes, now you can. ‫‫-Thanks. ‫‫Just so we're clear, ‫‫I'm not done with you yet. ‫‫Go over the photos. ‫‫Dismissed. ‫‫[Come here.] ‫‫[Is anyone following you?] ‫‫[Then why were you late? ‫‫You kept me waiting.] ‫‫[Sorry. The soldiers ‫‫pulled everyone over for inspection] ‫‫[-because some soldier was killed.] ‫‫[-I can't go on living like this,] ‫‫[running around like a dog. ‫‫I think the Secret Service is on to us.] ‫‫[Don't worry, things will calm down soon.] ‫‫[It's all because of Al Makdasi.] ‫‫[I told Walid not to trust him.] ‫‫[Walid stopped obeying authority ‫‫the day I told him he's the successor.] ‫‫[Did you know he let Al Makdasi ‫‫hide in the house in Rumana?] ‫‫[Instead of killing him, ‫‫he's helping him.] ‫‫[-What a mess.] ‫‫[-Let's go.] ‫‫[Move it!] ‫‫-Hello? ‫‫-Hey, Gali. ‫‫I got your message, ‫‫but I can't make it today. ‫‫I have to leave early in the morning. ‫‫Doron, I can't talk right now, okay? ‫‫Jalal the AC repairman is on his way, ‫‫-so I have to go to the ATM. ‫‫-Who's Jalal? ‫‫It's part of the AC's warranty, ‫‫he's coming for inspection. ‫‫What inspection? ‫‫What are you talking about? ‫‫-I don't know, that's what they said. ‫‫-Who? ‫‫The company. ‫‫Gali, don't let him in ‫‫until I get there, understand? ‫‫Are you nuts? He's on his way. ‫‫I said don't let him in until I get there! ‫‫Thanks! ‫‫[Hold your heads up high.] ‫‫[Be proud of Bilal, God granted him ‫‫the honor to die a Shahid.] ‫‫[Be proud of yourselves, too!] ‫‫[We killed a soldier today] ‫‫[and we'll kill many more, God willing.] ‫‫[We'll get back at those Jewish dogs ‫‫with God's help.] ‫‫[What about Bilal's funeral?] ‫‫[We can't go.] ‫‫[We'd all like to pay our respects to him,] ‫‫[but the Jews and the Authority ‫‫are after us.] ‫‫[But, Nidal, every organization ‫‫will send reps to his funeral,] ‫‫[-even the Jihad.] ‫‫[-What don't you understand, Ahmad?] ‫‫[We can't go.] ‫‫[Perhaps no organization ‫‫will claim responsibility for the attack,] ‫‫[which means that from now on ‫‫we operate in full secrecy.] ‫‫[Is that clear? All eyes are on us now.] ‫‫[They photograph everyone who attends ‫‫these funerals, am I right, Maher?] ‫‫[-Why do you ask me?] ‫‫[-Why not?] ‫‫[-I'm not my dad.] ‫‫[-But I bet you know.] ‫‫[Ahmad!] ‫‫[Cool it.] ‫‫[I asked him a simple question ‫‫as he must know if they do or don't.] ‫‫[We come before family ‫‫and before anything else.] ‫‫[Right, Maher?] ‫‫[The Jews don't knock on the door ‫‫when they come to kill.] ‫‫[Open the door, Ali.] ‫‫[It's Walid.] ‫‫[Hello, Walid.] ‫‫[-Pack your things and leave the house.] ‫‫[-Why?] ‫‫[The movement's leaders ‫‫are sick of the trouble you cause us.] ‫‫[Define "us."] ‫‫[You?] ‫‫[What don't you understand?] ‫‫[You shouldn't have carried out ‫‫the attack. This was against the orders.] ‫‫[We tried to kidnap a soldier.] ‫‫[-Isn't that what Hamas wants?] ‫‫[-I'll tell you what Hamas wants.] ‫‫[-Is kidnapping a soldier wrong?] ‫‫[-No.] ‫‫[You neither kidnapped him alive ‫‫nor returned with his body.] ‫‫[We couldn't.] ‫‫[That's why I told you ‫‫not to carry out an attack.] ‫‫[Had we successfully kidnapped him, ‫‫would you claim responsibility?] ‫‫[The movement would.] ‫‫[Nobody can claim responsibility ‫‫over an attack in the name of Hamas.] ‫‫[Who will take responsibility and pay for ‫‫Bilal's funeral and the mourning tent?] ‫‫[Not us.] ‫‫[You won't decide for Hamas.] ‫‫[He is not Hamas] ‫‫[and Hamas can't fund people like him.] ‫‫[I'm not Hamas?] ‫‫[I am the son ‫‫of Sheikh Abu Nidal Awdallah.] ‫‫[Who are you?] ‫‫[I am Hamas' military wing commander, ‫‫you piece of shit,] ‫‫[and from this moment ‫‫I order you to shut the fuck up!] ‫‫[You think we're a bunch of jackasses? ‫‫That Abed wouldn't tell me] ‫‫[that you pressured him ‫‫into giving you Doron's address?] ‫‫[Nidal, don't forget who you are.] ‫‫[Which side are you on?] ‫‫[Which side?] ‫‫[If you all don't leave this house,] ‫‫[I'm through with you] ‫‫[and things will end very badly.] ‫‫Hey! ‫‫-Who are you? ‫‫-Jalal. I'm here to check the AC. ‫‫[-Where are you from?] ‫‫[-From Nazareth, what's the problem?] ‫‫[Stop what you're doing and leave!] ‫‫-But the lady scheduled me. ‫‫-Oh, yeah? ‫‫-Who sent you, huh?! ‫‫-Doron... ‫‫-Who sent you?! ‫‫-Doron, what are you doing?! ‫‫-Let go of him! ‫‫-Who do you work for? ‫‫-What are you doing?! ‫‫-"Core International." ‫‫-"International," huh? Get the hell out! ‫‫-Leave him alone! ‫‫-Excuse me? ‫‫-I said, get out! ‫‫I'm calling the police, and you, ma'am, ‫‫owe us 250 shekels for the visit. ‫‫[-Beat it! Get out!] ‫‫-Calm down! ‫‫What's with you? ‫‫Come, let's go inside. ‫‫I'm sorry... ‫‫-Are you out of your mind?! ‫‫-I'm sorry. ‫‫-Don't come over here anymore. ‫‫-Gali... ‫‫I won't let you behave like this ‫‫in front of my kids! ‫‫-I'll get a restraining order against you. ‫‫-Gali, come on... ‫‫What was that about?! ‫‫[We're here, Abu Samara.] ‫‫[Thank you.] ‫‫[Wait here. Keep your eyes open.] ‫‫[Sure thing.] ‫‫[-The envelope.] ‫‫[-Oh...] ‫‫[The Occupation army has announced ‫‫that one of its soldiers has been killed] ‫‫[in an operation ‫‫carried out by Palestinians.] ‫‫[According to the Occupation army's ‫‫spokesman, Avihay Adraee,] ‫‫[the soldier served ‫‫in one of the IAF's elite units...] ‫‫This house has a history ‫‫which you all know too well: ‫‫It was one of the Panthers’ hideouts. ‫‫According to intel, ‫‫Al Makdasi was spotted there. ‫‫Given this indication, ‫‫we obviously don't have much time. ‫‫We have to gear up and head out. ‫‫Any questions? ‫‫I want you all to be extra alert. ‫‫We've taken enough shit till now. ‫‫Doron, come here, ‫‫I want to have a word with you. ‫‫What is it? ‫‫You won't be joining today's operation. ‫‫-What do you mean? ‫‫-You're staying put. ‫‫-What are you talking about, Eli? ‫‫-You think you can do as you please? ‫‫The first thing I told you ‫‫was no funny business, ‫‫but I guess you misheard me. ‫‫You won't do as you please here. ‫‫-Go fuck yourself. ‫‫-Doron... ‫‫[Stay, I'm making coffee.] ‫‫[-No time for coffee, I'm in a rush.] ‫‫[-Where to?] ‫‫[A soccer game with Nasser and his cousin. ‫‫We only have the court for 90 minutes.] ‫‫[You play soccer dressed like that?] ‫‫[My clothes are in the bag.] ‫‫[Why aren't you wearing ‫‫the Adidas sneakers you asked for?] ‫‫[Are those in the bag, too?] ‫‫[I forgot them at Nasser's. ‫‫He's bringing them to the court.] ‫‫[Fine, let's have some coffee.] ‫‫Atalef, this is Commander. ‫‫What's going on there? ‫‫Atalef to Commander, ‫‫everything's clear, no gunmen. ‫‫-I'm leaving in two minutes. ‫‫-Roger. ‫‫-They're going to hunt down my source. ‫‫-Looks like he fucked you over, Gabi. ‫‫NABLUS, RAFIDIA ‫‫[-Is everything alright?] ‫‫[-Absolutely.] ‫‫[It's smaller than it looked ‫‫in the photos, but it's nice.] ‫‫[I wrote down two rooms ‫‫because that room is also a bedroom.] ‫‫[It doesn't get rented out often ‫‫because it's below ground level,] ‫‫[-that's why it's also cheap.] ‫‫[-I'm fine with it.] ‫‫[It's usually girls, students, ‫‫who rent it.] ‫‫[Don't worry, I'll keep it tidy.] ‫‫What a surprise, huh? ‫‫-Amazingly, it's not your fault this time. ‫‫-No shit. ‫‫It's not always about you. ‫‫This time it was an intel slipup. ‫‫Whatever. ‫‫[This is a standard lease contract.] ‫‫[Yes, I'll read it.] ‫‫[Is it a problem if I pay you in cash?] ‫‫[Not at all.] ‫‫[What did you say you do in Nablus?] ‫‫[I was living in Jordan for a while] ‫‫[and came back to help out ‫‫with the family business.] ‫‫[You know, times are tough, ‫‫so I came to be close to my family.] ‫‫[Well, you're a good son.] ‫‫[Did you leave your wife behind ‫‫in Jordan?] ‫‫[No, I didn't, actually.] ‫‫[Fadi?] ‫‫[You don't look like a "Fadi."] ‫‫[Yeah, I get that a lot.] ‫‫[Need anything else?

Goodbye.] ‫‫[You, too, my friend.] ‫‫[The person you have called ‫‫is not available...] ‫‫What's up? Can we talk? ‫‫What are you doing here this late? ‫‫I need to talk to you about something. ‫‫-About the operation? ‫‫-No, no. ‫‫Remember the camera ‫‫we installed in Shirin's home? ‫‫I know, she took the picture down, ‫‫we lost the image. ‫‫-Well, she saw me. ‫‫-When? ‫‫When I installed the camera. We spoke. ‫‫-Why didn't you-- ‫‫-Hear me out. It's good for us. ‫‫She wants to help us, ‫‫-she wants out of the country. ‫‫-How do you know? ‫‫-She wrote to my username. ‫‫-What username? ‫‫The one I used ‫‫back in the operation in Ramallah. ‫‫Doron, are you crazy? Are you purposely ‫‫defying orders just to endanger yourself? ‫‫Gabi, you taught me "For by wise counsel ‫‫thou shalt make thy war." ‫‫But we're up against a classic situation ‫‫of kidnapping or killing ‫‫a counterterrorist operative! ‫‫Remember the Amna Muna affair? ‫‫-Yes. ‫‫-If she's double-crossing you-- ‫‫-She's not. ‫‫-I said "if"! ‫‫This could all be a trap. ‫‫They could be setting us up, ‫‫tempting her to talk with you, ‫‫which is easy since you're a jackass... ‫‫-Yep. ‫‫-Then set a meeting point ‫‫-and kidnap you. Classic! ‫‫-That's not the case. ‫‫Says who? ‫‫They're just as crafty as we are! ‫‫So what should I do, Gabi? ‫‫Tell her to leave me alone? ‫‫I can get you Walid and Al Makdasi, ‫‫I thought you'd be thankful! ‫‫-Yeah, thank you. ‫‫-You're welcome! ‫‫Alright. ‫‫From now on, ‫‫I tell you when to contact her. ‫‫Doron, I want to know ‫‫where you go, with whom, ‫‫what you do and what you say. ‫‫Is that clear? ‫‫Don't do anything without my approval ‫‫or you'll be at risk. ‫‫Do you even realize the consequences ‫‫if you are kidnapped? ‫‫Fine, I'll set up a meeting. ‫‫No. ‫‫They could ambush us. ‫‫-You can meet with her spontaneously. ‫‫-Okay. ‫‫-I'll tell Eli not to bust your balls. ‫‫-Thanks. ‫‫So, how's your son doing? ‫‫Get outta my office, you idiot. ‫‫NABLUS, RAFIDIA HOSPITAL ‫‫Be alert, guys, ‫‫they'll be there any minute. ‫‫[Excuse me, my wife ‫‫has been waiting here for two hours.] ‫‫[I'm a doctor, ‫‫a nurse will be right with you.] ‫‫[Shame on you. Is this how ‫‫you treat patients? Look at her!] ‫‫[-Let go of me.] ‫‫[-Not until a doctor tends to my wife!] ‫‫[-You're a doctor? Then tend to her!] ‫‫[-Sir, sir!] ‫‫[Let go of her or I'll break your arm.] ‫‫[-Cool it, pal.] ‫‫[-You cool it!] ‫‫[Go up to the roof. ‫‫Amir Mahajne is waiting for you.] ‫‫[Who do you think you are, butting in?!] ‫‫[You think you run this hospital?! ‫‫Watch it, kid!] ‫‫[Sir, all I wanted is ‫‫to ensure there is no trouble.] ‫‫[The doctor works very hard,] ‫‫[so cut her some slack.] ‫‫[Okay?] ‫‫[Okay.] ‫‫[Champ.] ‫‫[-Are you alright?] ‫‫[-What are you doing here?] ‫‫[I preferred not to come to your house, ‫‫there are too many eyes on you.] ‫‫[Move the bed!] ‫‫[-Get it out of the way!] ‫‫[-Sorry...] ‫‫[I have something for you.] ‫‫[Here you go.] ‫‫[Sorry they took it away from you, but...] ‫‫[-we still have to issue you an exit visa.] ‫‫[-Great.] ‫‫[The "shadow" has exited.] ‫‫[I know that he visits you sometimes.] ‫‫[They'll kill him next time.] ‫‫[It's best that we both avoid that.] ‫‫[Promise me you won't kill him] ‫‫[-and I'll tell you when we can meet.] ‫‫[-Alright.] ‫‫[He saved my life. ‫‫They were going to kill me and my family.] ‫‫[I understand, Shirin. ‫‫I'm sick of all this violence.] ‫‫Doron, he headed straight for the stairs. ‫‫You have 30 seconds. ‫‫[We must hurry up.] ‫‫[-This is for you.] ‫‫[-What is it?] ‫‫[A SIM card for your phone ‫‫so you can call me directly.] ‫‫[Take it out before your meeting ‫‫so they won't track you, okay?] ‫‫[-Okay?] ‫‫[-Thank you.] ‫‫[Thank you.] ‫‫[Shirin...] ‫‫[Do you love him?] ‫‫[I don't love him. I owe him.] ‫‫Doron, move it, ‫‫the guard will be on the roof any second. ‫‫[I have some work to do here.] ‫‫[I'll call you back, okay?] ‫‫[Where is everybody?] ‫‫[It's too risky for us all ‫‫to meet in one place.] ‫‫[My dad keeps calling me nonstop.] ‫‫[Good for you, ‫‫your dad worries about you.] ‫‫[What did you tell him?] ‫‫[That I got bruised playing soccer.] ‫‫[He's starting to get suspicious.] ‫‫[It'll be alright, God willing.] ‫‫[What's our next step?] ‫‫[We wait.] ‫‫[We wait?] ‫‫[Go home and stay with your family.] ‫‫[Alright?] ‫‫[Goodbye.] ‫‫[-Peace be upon you.] ‫‫[-Upon you be peace.] ‫‫[Where are you, Abu Seif? ‫‫It's been a while.
