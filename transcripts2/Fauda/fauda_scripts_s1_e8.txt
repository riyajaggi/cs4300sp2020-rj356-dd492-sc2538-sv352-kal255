 -Doron! -Boaz! Motherfucker... Boaz! Doron, I'm wiping them out. -Motherfucker... -Doron, what do I do? Doron, talk to me! Doron! Shut up! Let him go! -Doron! -Go! [ARABIC] [Sheikh!] Doron, don't! [Walid, what's going on?] [What's going on?]

 [Drive!] You okay? Abir. Abir. Doron! Doron! Doron! Two explosions were reported in Wadi Zaitoon. Show me an aerial photo. This was taken six minutes ago. Boaz is dead. Yes, Moreno? We've got a positive ID. Boaz is dead. -Where's Doron Kabilio? -We'll find him soon. Boaz is dead. -I asked you a question. -I don't know where he is, Gideon. Mr. Defense Minister, to you!

 And if I ask you to track him down, you leave everything and bring his sorry ass down here stat! -It would be best to-- -It'd be best if you weren't born, then this unit could have a real commander, and avoid this catastrophe! Go track him down! Send someone to collect all of Boaz's remains and to leave nothing in the area. And find Kabilio. Stat. Send another chopper and a drone. We must get Doron back before he's captured. That's the primary task now. Word got out. Al Jazeera has the initial report, but they still don't understand what exactly happened. There's also a report of a girl with an explosive belt at the scene. A girl with an explosive belt? These people are animals. -It was us. -What do you mean? We strapped that belt on her. But she's alive, thank God. Hear that? Fly the girl to Hadassah Hospital right now, and locate that son of a bitch. He's completely lost it. If he pulls a Baruch Goldstein stunt, we're all screwed. [What happened?] [Catastrophe. Catastrophe.] [-What about Abir?] [-I think she was wounded.] [-Is she alive?] [-I don't know, I'm not sure.] [You were there, didn't you see?] [I saw her lying on the ground, I don't know if she was alive.] [What about the Sheikh?] [He died a Shahid.] [May God have mercy on him.] [Let me think.] [To think? Now you want to think?!] [You should've done that before ordering me] [to blow him to bits!] [Watch it! Do you know who you're talking to?] [Yes, I know full well who I'm talking to.] [The only thing that matters to you is revenge. Your decisions stink!] [Walid!] [Have you forgotten that I raised you with my own two hands?] [The Sheikh is dead because of you and God knows what's with Abir.] [If it weren't for your fucking cousin, this wouldn't have happened!] [Don't you talk about her like that!] [Think about it!] [How did the Jews know he was booby-trapped?] [It's easy for you to pin it all on her, huh?] [Who else then? You? How did they know?] [She'd never tell anyone.] [Stop whining like a baby!] [You're either a fighter or a child.] [Bring her here.] [You're making a big mistake.] [She's my daughter.] [What will people think of you if you let her] [get treated in an Israeli hospital?] [My daughter is there. Who cares what people will think of me?] [You know what they'll call you?] [A traitor.] [That you collaborated with Israel to get treatment for your daughter.] [Have you forgotten Ali Karmi?] [Ali did it for his daughter's sake, and I think he's a hero.] [I think he knew the price he would pay.] [Our family never collaborated with the Israelis,] [and you're a member of this family.] [Have your daughter treated in a Palestinian hospital.] [Enough. I'm taking the kids and getting out of this town.] [Watch Ahmad for me.] [Tell him that I went to get Abir and that I'm coming back for him.] [-What is it, dear?] [-A call for Nassrin.] [Thanks.] [-Hello?] [-Hi, Mother.] [Hello, my dear son.] [How's Abir?] [Is she alive?] [Yes, my son. Abir is alive,] [but her eye was wounded.] [Praise God.] [Is Nassrin there? Put her on.] [Nassrin is here, but...] [She can't come to the phone.] [What do you mean? Let me talk to her.] [Talk to him. Talk to him.] [Hold on. She's too upset to talk now. Stay on the line.] [Don't hang it up, stay here.] [Talk to him, I tell you.] [He's your husband, the father of your children.] [You and the children mean the world to him.] [You're the air that Abu Ahmad breathes.] [You're talking to me about the children?] [Do you even hear yourself?] [You think we're in favor of this war? That we want it?] [-You're not the only one suffering here.] [-Enough!] [Stop using my anguish as an excuse for your son's doing.] [Whether you like it or not, people think of you as the Panther's widow.] [I really wish I were the Panther's widow.] [My dear son, my love,] [Nassrin...] [...went to visit Abir at the Israeli hospital.] [Do you need any help?] [Come, I'll help you.] Gali, it's me. The Rabbi is here, he wants to talk to you. Not now. Can I come in? Come on, Gali, open the door. No. Well, I'm here if you need me. Thanks. This was his first Hanukkah celebration in kindergarten. Here he's dressed up as a clown in pajamas. [Please, my daughter is in the hospital.] Sorry, it's an emergency, my daughter is in the hospital. [Go ahead.] [-May I?] [-Sure.] -Good morning. -ID, please. Yes. [Sunglasses off.] -Come with me, please. -What's the problem? [Come on.] Excuse me. Why you took-- [-Strip.] -Why? [Strip.] My daughter is in the hospital. She's alone. [-My daughter is in the--] [-Shut up.] [Come on, shoes off.] Shoes, shoes. [Come on, strip, faster.] [My daughter is alone in the hospital. She's eight.] [Faster.] [Strip.] [The Hijab.] [Bow your head.] Get out, please. Get out! Idiot. [-Sorry about her degrading behavior.] [-It's alright.] [I'll wait outside while you get dressed. I'll drive you there.] Quite the actress. You deserve an Oscar. Any time, Gabi. [It's hot like hell, damn it.] [I really apologize for her behavior.] [There was no reason for that.] [I don't care about that. Where is Abir?] [Do you know where she is?] [She's in Hadassah Medical Center.] [She was wounded in her eye, she needs surgery.] [How bad is it? Can she see?] [How is she?] [We'll know only after the surgery.] [I want to transfer her here, to Ramallah, for her surgery.] [Wait. First speak with the doctor, then decide.] [I already made my decision. I want to transfer her to Ramallah, please.] In all my 22 years of work for the security forces I have never seen anything like this. It's mutiny. That's exactly what this is. Moreno, we had to, they kidnapped Boaz. Shut your mouth! If it weren't for me, you'd still be stealing car radios in poor neighborhoods, and this is how you thank me? By undermining my authority?! By breaking apart my unit? In any developed country, the four of you would be executed, so just be thankful we've got a shitty country. Had we brought Boaz back alive we wouldn't be having this talk. But you didn't did you? So shut the hell up, all of you! I'm just saying that we failed operationally, not ethically. Avihai, buddy, do me a favor-- So what happens now, Moreno? Jail? -I'll know when the investigation is over. -And the team? The team-- -Well, the team-- -Okay, stop, Moreno. We get it. Let's go. We'll see you around. You know, if I had to do it all over again, I'd do it exactly the same way. Sit. -I think he's fucking Nurit. -Is that all you gathered from that talk? -That and something about mutiny. -Idiot. -What will you do now? -I don't know. Maybe I'll go to the Yehuda desert for a bit. I could use the silence. Yeah, because you've been yapping nonstop. Certainly less than you and Boaz. [God have mercy on his soul.] Poor bastard. -He fucked like a rabbit. -Yep. Guys who get laid the most always die young. -That's why you'll live forever. -You bet. Well... -Would you really do it all over again? -Of course. Would you? My only regret is not putting the moves on Nurit. Forget it, she'd reject you anyway. Don't you ever do that to me again. -Aren't you kicking me out too? -No, you had no choice. -And the other guys did? -Forget them, they're history. I want you to keep being our Intelligence officer. You'll decide when to join missions and when to stay here with me. You'll be your own boss. I also want you to help us form another team. Us? Naor and me. He'll be team commander. -What if Doron comes back? -He has nothing waiting for him here in Israel, only a court sentence and jail. What do you say? I'm sorry, but I can't stay. What is it? You can't kick them out and keep me. -I can. -But I can't. Nurit, think about it. You're the only one who's getting another chance. Take it. Who ever thought I could say no? -Hello. -Hello. -Thanks for seeing us right away. -Sure thing. This is Nassrin, Abir's mother. [Nassrin, Prof. Shalit is the doctor who's treating Abir.] -Nice to meet you, Professor. -Nice to meet you too. I want to tell you that Abir is a charming little girl. -Thanks. How is she? -She had a lot of luck. She's conscious, but her left eye is in danger. If we won't operate soon, she might lose her sight and maybe even the eye itself. [Don't worry. Prof. Shalit is Israel's number one expert in eye injuries] [and one of the best in the world.] I did hundreds of operations like this. No, please transfer her to Ramallah, -we have enough good doctors of our own. -I'm sure you do, but you don't have in Ramallah the equipment that we have here. [And you don't have Prof. Shalit.] -No, I can't. I can't. -Believe me, I understand your fear, but right now you must think only about what's best for your daughter, -not about anything else. -No, I can't. Nassrin, I will watch Abir and take care of her as if she's my own daughter. It'll take time until you get to Ramallah and every moment now is important to save the eye. I'm sorry, I have to go now. Please let me know what you decide. Thank you. [Want some water?] [Do you?] Could she get some water, please? Thanks. [Listen.] [To me, the best time of the year is] [when I take my five kids to the desert.] [No phones, no emails, nothing.] [We sleep out there and go for hikes.] [One time, in the middle of a hike,] [my youngest son Nadav was bitten by a viper.] [I panicked,] [and made every possible mistake] [trying to do things I'd seen in movies, on TV.] [We made it to the hospital in the nick of time.] [The kid was more dead than alive.] [But the best possible doctor was on duty just then,] [and he saved the boy.] [It was an Arab doctor.] [I found you the best doctor we've got.] [I want to see her now.] [-Mommy.] [-Yes, my daughter?] [Are you staying here with me?] [Of course I am. I'm not leaving your side.] [What will they do to me?] [Just a small operation.] [You'll be asleep, so you won't feel a thing.] [Don't be scared. I got you the best doctor in the world.] [-I'm not scared.] [-I know. You're so brave.] [Are we in Israel, Mommy?] [Yes, my daughter.] [The doctor said he'll take care of my eye,] [and he gave me some candy.] [They're all Jews here, right, Mommy?] [I think you're tired and you should rest, right?] [-Get some sleep.] [-Okay.] [Close your eyes.] [Go to sleep, my little child] [Let's fall asleep on the carpet] [Sleep in the darkness] [Until the cloud shall pass] [Obscuring all the neighbors...] [Peace be upon you. What happened to you?] [Come with me, let's go to the mosque.] [Thank you.] [In the name of the all merciful Allah,] [I hereby purify myself for prayer. Allahu Akbar.] He's here. Anything you want to say? They're a bunch of screw-ups. I discharged them. To hell with them. I only kept Naor as team commander. We'll form a new team. There're excellent guys out there. Listen, Moreno, I'll make it snappy. This unit, this fiasco, is over. -That's what I just said. -No, it's not. You want to start everything from scratch. Right. Naor had nothing to do with this fiasco, he'll be a great commander. You're not listening to me. Your men led this country to the brink of war. You know how that Sheikh blowing up damaged my reputation?! Not to mention Boaz and the little girl. Sorry, but I must discharge you and disassemble the team. What? You're discharging me? You can't do that. Think long and hard before you do this. You know that you got this far thanks to my dirty work. Moreno, you've lost your touch. Even your criminals lost faith in you and kept you out of the loop. Back in the day, you would resign without me having to kick you out. -I've never been discharged. -You think you deserve an award? A bravery medal? Don't worry, I'll make sure you get a large pension. After all, you've done some great things for this country. Screw you, Gideon. TO MICKEY MORENO WITH ALL OUR APPRECIATION Hello? Hello? Doron, is that you? Doron? Doron? Where are you? Are you okay? Is it Dad? Let me talk to him. -Talk, he's listening. -Dad, where are you? Dad? Dad?
