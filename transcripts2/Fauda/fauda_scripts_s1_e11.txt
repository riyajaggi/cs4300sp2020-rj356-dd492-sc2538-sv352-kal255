 ARURA VILLAGE NORTH OF RAMALLAH [ARABIC] [How are you, Abu Bassal?] [-May God have mercy on his soul.] [-It's a great honor that you came.] [Abu Bassal, I am honored to be] [in the presence of a Shahid's father.] [Your son was a true hero.] [Abu Bassal, this is from The Movement in Amman.] [It's just a small portion, of course. We take care of our men.] [-Thank you.] [-You're welcome, sir.] [Take care of yourselves. We will be in touch.] [What's going on?!] [-Where to?] [-Don't move!]

 [Abu Halil,] [you visit the West Bank and don't come to say hi?] [You Hamas folks have no manners.] [So you brought me in here just to crack jokes?] [Of course not, pal. I brought you here to help you.] [To help me? Thanks a lot.] [I've heard different rumors, Abu Halil. Rumors from Amman.] [Such as?] [They say that the Hamas has begun suspecting you.] [Suspecting me? Of what?] [They put lots of money in your hands] [and somehow, a portion of that money always seems to...] [...evaporate.] [Nonsense.] [That's just what I told them.]

 [As I said before, I want to help you.] [They said, "Look, he traveled to the West Bank with $50,000] [but arrived with only $45,000."] [You're just making up the numbers, it's nonsense.] ["Nonsense", that's exactly what I told them.] ["Don't bash him", I said.] ["He's a devoted, longtime Hamas member and was always faithful.] [Have you no shame?"] [But then they presented me with this...] [Check it out.] [Sums, dates, bank accounts,] [names, everything.] [Still say it's nonsense?] [You call this "nonsense"?] [Help me so I can help you.] [I don't want these figures to appear on walls around the West Bank.] [Everyone here can read.] [You met with Abu Ahmad.] [Abu Ahmad is dead.] [Abu Ahmad is alive. Give us a little credit, will you?] [Abu Ahmad is dead.] [If I reveal what I know, Abu Ahmad won't be the only dead guy.] [Where did you meet with him?] [I don't know.] [They took me there with a Kaffiyah over my eyes.] [What did he want from you?] [If I tell you, will you keep it a secret and let me go home?] [It's not up to me, but I'll do my best. Sometimes it helps.] [If he finds out I told you, he will have me killed.] [He won't find out.] [I brought him sarin nerve gas.] God damn it! Don't touch that crap. Better eat some fruit. -Again with the red cell phone? -This phone rang. Walid Al-Abed, Abu Ahmad's right-hand man, called it. I heard them talk, Doron wasn't kidding, he really did penetrate the Hamas. They're meeting with him tomorrow at 10 a.m. before his suicide attack. He gave him the exact coordinates. Gideon, they'll be using sarin gas in this attack. It's the worst nerve gas there is, 500 times more deadly than cyanide. -How did they get it? -Abu Halil smuggled it in from Jordan or Syria. What's the difference? It's coming our way, Gideon. Would you risk a mass-casualty event during your term now that you know? Thank you. And if Doron survives, you release him and grant him a full pardon. -Where've you been? Hawaii? -Sure, Hawaii not...? -We've been worried sick, bro. -Get a room, you guys. -How've you been? -Steve, give us a minute. So I've got good news and bad. The good news is, Steve will take you home. The bad news is... ...you get to be a suicide bomber like you wanted. -I am? -You are. And there's a bonus: If you make it out alive, Gideon will let you off the hook completely. You'll be a free man. -It's what you wanted, right? -Yes. When do we leave? Steve! I think we've gone too far, bro. I can't. Can't go back? How could I, after what I've done? It's like the tale about the bear and the rabbit. Know it? No. A bear and a rabbit go to poop in the forest. The bear asks the rabbit, "Doesn't it bug you when shit sticks to your fur?" The rabbit says, "Not at all." So the bear grabs the rabbit and wipes his ass with him. -What's that got to do with anything? -Nothing, bro. That's just it. You've got a home, so return to it. I'd like to thank the directors and staff at Assaf Harofeh Hospital for giving us the opportunity to have Nassrin and Abir Hammed, and hopefully, we will someday get to see them again under merrier circumstances. Nassrin, you've got the sweetest and bravest girl that I ever saw. -God bless her. -Thank you, Doctor. [-So? How are you doing?] [-Praise God.] -They say the kid is alright. -Thank you. [She was so happy to get that teddy bear.] [It's weird how kids love stuffed teddy bears,] [more than cats, dogs or bunnies.] [Teddy bears are the all-time favorite.] [Because they're still young.] [They don't know that bears are predators.] [Nassrin, I need to tell you something,] [but don't be mad at me.] [Here are your and your children's German passports.] [The taxi is waiting outside.] [You'll arrive at a hotel in Tel Aviv, your son Ahmad is waiting there.] [Tomorrow the three of you will fly to Berlin.] [I'll arrange a house for you.] [And there's no way back?] [Nassrin,] [if you ever need anything, no matter what] [or when,] [I will be at your service.] [-Hello?] [-Taufiq, my son, they've taken Ahmad.] [Who did?] [The army.] [And they took the German passports of Nassrin and the children!] [Alright, Mother, don't cry.] [Poor Ahmad,] [he didn't understand what's going on.] [The poor thing just wants to be with his mother.] [He is with her now, Mother.] [So why did they kidnap him?] [Nassrin is taking the children to Berlin.] [It's her decision.] [You must stop them, my son.] [Please, stop them.] [Alright, Mother.] [I must hang up now. Don't worry.] [Everything will be alright.] [Taufiq...] Can you stop here, please? [Give me the teddy bear.] [Momma, why did you do that?] [I'll buy you a nicer teddy bear. This one is no good.] [I want my teddy bear, it's good.] [-No, my child, it's not.] [-It is too!] [Abura, gifts from the Jews are very dangerous.] [We don't want nor need anything from them. Always remember that.] [The doctor who treated me is a Jew, so is the man who gave me the bear.] [Yes, but it's the Jews' fault that you even ended up in a hospital.] [Understand?] [-No, I want my teddy bear.] [-I'll get you a nicer one.] [No, I want the Jewish teddy bear.] [Abura, calm down.] [I hate you!] [Go inside. Come on, my child.] [Momma, may I?] [Yes, darling.] [I'm hungry.] [Soon we'll go out to eat, darling.] [Who would like some tea?] [-I would.] [-Me too.] [Great, we'll have a tea party.] What are we doing here? Bro, I'll come here some other time. "Exalted and hallowed be His great Name throughout the world which He created according to His will. May He establish His kingship, bring forth His redemption and hasten the coming of His Moshiach in your lifetime and in your days and in the lifetime of the entire house of Israel, speedily and soon; and say, Amen. May His great Name be blessed forever and to all eternity. Blessed and praised, glorified, exalted and extolled, honored, adored and lauded be the Name of the Holy One blessed be He. Beyond all the blessings, hymns, praises and consolations that are uttered in the world; and say, Amen. May there be abundant peace from Heaven and a good life for us and for all Israel; and say: Amen. He Who makes peace in His heavens, may He make peace for us and for all Israel; and say, Amen." -Ido... -Hands up! -Ido, be careful, it's very dangerous. -My daddy isn't here because of you! Idodi? Idodi, put the gun down. Put it down. Gali, there's a bullet in the barrel. I'll handle this. Sweetie, put the gun down, everything's alright. Put the gun down. Ido, what are you doing?! Put the gun down. He and Mom are together! Get the hell out. I should have killed him. Daddy! Hey. -Daddy, what happened to Ido? -Nothing. He's fine. Daddy, Uncle Boaz died. I know. And Mommy is sad. So am I. [Momma, where are we going?] [We're going to Grandma Hafida, in Germany.] [It's a beautiful country.] [Did you know I grew up there?] [Is Grandma Jihan coming with us?] [Yes, she is.] [-Are there televisions there?] [-Awesome televisions.] [I don't want to go.] [Abura, did you know that Grandma Hafida] [lives an hour away from an amusement park?] [What's that?] [It's a big playground with games and swings, like you see on TV.] [I don't care.] [-I do want to go.] [-We will, my son.] [-Tasty, huh?] [-Thanks.] [-Some orange soda?] [-No.] [Don't you like it?] [Sometimes, but I usually don't drink] [sugary drinks.] [Oh...] [What do you usually drink?] [Orange juice.] [-Freshly squeezed, or--] [-Whichever.] [What about my proposal?] [Well...] [-I'm thinking about it.] [-What's there to think about?] [Just say "yes" and I'll take you to--] [Fine.] [I'm thinking.] [-Walid...] [-Open it, don't be shy.] [You shouldn't have.] [From this day on, I will protect you.] [I will give you the best possible life.] [It's not that simple.] [It's very simple.] [If you value your life, marry me.] [We live in great chaos,] [but as my wife, no one would dare harm you.] [Okay then.] [Okay what?] [What's okay?] [I will marry you.] [I'll have some orange soda.] [-Want some?] [-Yeah.] Need help? No, thanks. Do you want to break up? You found someone new, didn't you? Are you fucking Naor? Answer me already! What do you want me to say? I'm dying to hear why you're fucking my friend behind my back! Because he loves me and loves sleeping with me. -Sorry. -Is that so, Gali? Every Arab off the street would do you. What are you fighting for? Are you fighting over me? It's been over for a long time and you know it. You didn't fight for me. Did you ever fight for me? I have been, for years. But you were never here to actually see it. How I was waiting up for you to come back every night, lying to the kids, to myself, loving you. I loved you even though I'm afraid of you. Why be afraid of me, huh? I did everything for you! I did everything I could to bring your brother back! Yes, but... ...you brought him back dead. [Don't go.] [Abu Ahmad.] [Abu Ahmad, just tell me what's in that bag.] [Redemption.] [The suicide bomber will use it tomorrow.] [Sarin nerve gas.] [-Do you know what it does?] [-No.] [First it feels like you have a cold.] [Then you start to choke.] [Then you vomit and choke to death.] [It could lead to war.] [Well, what do you think we've been engaged in so far?] [-You know what I'm talking about.] [-You're right.] [You have no idea how right you are.] [The bombing will take place in a synagogue.] [In a synagogue?] [The Jews will respond] [with an extremely severe retaliation.] [They'll be committing such unprecedented war crimes,] [that all Islamic states will intervene, including Iran.] [By the time America decides to step in, it will be too late,] [for it will be the beginning of the end of the Zionists.] [But it's exaggerated.] [We've never carried out anything like this before, or used nerve gas.] [Think again. Think big.] [Everything we've done to this day has brought us to this moment.] [This bombing will change the entire balance of power in the Middle East.] [We'll go down in history.] [-But there will be so many casualties.] [-That's the goal.] [I'm talking about our side, not theirs, once they retaliate.] [You must send Nassrin and the children away.] [Are you alright?] [We need to resolve this issue.] [I've already taken care of it. Stop pestering me.] [Lord, give her health] [Every day] [Go to sleep, go to sleep] [I will bring you a dove] [A dove in flight, and you will believe my words] [I'm trying to get Abura to sleep] [Sweet, sweet Abura] [With your lovely black hair]
