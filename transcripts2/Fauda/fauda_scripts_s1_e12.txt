 "Yea, thou I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me." Doron, the team is ready for the briefing. [ARABIC] [Stop it!] [I didn't do anything.] [-Stop looking at me like that.] [-Like what?] [Quit looking at me, it's making me nervous.] [There are no explosives on it yet, why are you scared?] [Now you're an engineer? Yahya Ayyash 2?] [You don't need to be Yahya Ayyash to know the vest isn't loaded yet.]

 [I left an empty pocket for the element, as Abu Ahmad requested.] [This element will lead to an all-out war in the Middle East.] [God willing.] While they are preparing Doron, we keep our distance. Once Abu Ahmad arrives, we storm in and snatch him, dead or alive. How do we keep track of Doron? Using every means of technology we have, and this. You plan to use cigarette smoke to find him? This packet has GPS and a bugging device. As long as Doron carries it, we can track him. How do we know Abu Ahmad will meet with Doron? Abu Ahmad meets all his suicide bombers personally. He's the final stop before the vest goes on.

 We storm in when Doron is already wearing the vest?! -Yes. -No way! That's insane. Well, we can't plan every detail up front. I trust you guys completely. Have you got your jockstrap on? Okay, guys, in 10 minutes we hit the road. Doron, don't worry. We've got your back. BEITUNIA SOUTH OF RAMALLAH [Peace be upon you.] [Feel free to smoke in the car, my friend.] [I quit about a year ago.] [You know why?] [Not for my health, but because it's pricy.] [I used to smoke a packet a day.] [You know how much that cost me?] [Each month I'd spend an entire week's salary on smokes.] [Not to mention that once I quit,] [I got back my senses of smell and taste.] [Tomatoes were suddenly tastier.] Hey, relax, it's alright. If he can stand this guy, he can take anything. I'd blow myself up with that driver by now. [Today I'm already over it.] [You can smoke right before me, it doesn't bother me. It really doesn't.] [-Is this it?] [-Yes, my friend.] [Those were their directions.] [-Thanks, pal.] [-Gladly.] [Should I stay here while you wait for them?] [No, thanks, I'm fine.] Pull over. [Could I have a cigarette?] [-Sure, my friend.] [-Thanks, buddy.] Samah is entering the building. Nabil, you guys are parked too far. Move closer. -Any closer, and we'll be exposed. -It's your call. -I think you're too far. -It's okay, trust me. Make sure the drone doesn't descend, not even for a second. According to my monitor, he just walked in. [Samah, come in.] [-Peace be upon you.] [-Upon you be peace.] [Don't worry, God is with you.] [Thanks for coming.] [Do you feel ready?] [Of course.] [This is Khaled, a heck of a guy, he's one of ours.] [We call him The Jew because everyone thinks he's a Jew.] [-Peace be upon you.] [-Upon you be peace and God's mercy.] [This is our engineer Samir.] [Listen, there are some things to do before you go.] [Khaled will go over them with you.] [-You will be wearing this vest.] [-Careful!] [Sorry. Samir is very precautious about his work.] [It will be put on you very very slowly.] [Samir will walk you through the other details.] [You must be extra careful when you're putting this on, got it?] [-Hello?] [-Hello, my love.] [How are you, my darling?] [-Why are you calling? [-I miss you. Don't you miss me?] [Yes.] [What's wrong, my love?] [Nothing.] [-What are you doing?] [-Nothing.] [-Okay, I'll be there soon.] [-No, Walid, there's no reason for that.] [Do I need a reason to come see my future wife?] [-No, but--] [-No buts. I'm coming over.] [-Bye bye.] [-No, Wali--] [In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful] [Have you been doing this for many years?] [One day I will have the courage to be a Shahid myself.] [Are volunteers usually as quiet as I am?] [You're the most talkative one I've met so far.] [What now?] [Time to pray. This way.] [Allahu akbar.] [Allahu akbar.] [Allahu akbar.] [Allahu akbar.] [God listens to his followers.] [Allahu akbar.] [Allahu akbar.] [May God's mercy and peace be upon you.] [Is it ready?] [-Hello.] [-Hello.] [I have to take every item you've got on you.] [Including the cigarettes.] [What?] [Hand over the cigarettes.] [I need them.] [Your faith will keep you strong.] [You must be completely pure.] [I'll get rid of them on the way there.] [Our religion forbids smoking. It's a sin.] [You're going on a mission in Allah's name.] [I won't let the cigarettes stir you from that.] [Please, give me the packet.] [Samir will take you through the practical side of the mission.] [Go ahead, Samir. We're ready.] [The explosives are in these pockets.] [You press this button to detonate it...] [-Are you listening?] [-Yes, I am.] [-Are you sure?] [-Yes.] [-Did you see where the button is?] [-There.] [Don't touch it! You'll blow us up!] [Samir, calm down.] [-He's not focused.] [-Calm down.] [He understands only when you yell at him.] [Okay.] [-Is everything understood?] [-Yes.] [Good. Now I will try to put it on you, nice and slow.] [-Slide your arm in there.] [-Slowly.] [Grab this.] [You can fasten it tightly, as long as it's comfortable.] [Now Khaled can't say that we don't worry about comfort.] [Keep working.] [-Is that comfortable?] [-Yes, yes.] [Alright. Now, this pocket--] [Let's put that there.] [We leave that pocket empty for the added element] [-which you'll receive in half an hour.] [-What element?] [Something extra. You'll know soon enough.] [Don't be scared.] [One of the best Mujahideen (Jihad warriors)] [in the history of Islam will give it to you.] [-See? Now he's listening.] [-He sure is.] [Alright then.] [Come in.] [They're beautiful. Thanks.] [That's nothing.] [I'm planning the biggest wedding ever, it will last three whole days.] [I'll be scattering roses all over the city, just for you.] [It will be the talk of the town.] [What is it? Why aren't you happy?] [Everything is fine.] [Shirin.] [Shirin!] [We're getting married soon. We must be honest with each other.] [-Whatever bothers you, bothers me.] [-Walid...] [You're my cousin.] [I love you, but this isn't right.] [What isn't right?] [I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore.] [Wait, after the wedding you'll be completely safe.] [No, Walid, I can't do this.] [-Shirin, just--] [-I can't go on with this.] [-Wait a couple of days.] [-No, I can't marry you.] [What do you mean, you can't marry me?] [We can't get married.] [Why? Why?] [Because I don't love you.] [You're kidding, right?] [Huh?] [-You're kidding, right?] [-No.] [-Is this because of him?] [-Who?] [That bastard from the the Palestine Preventive Security!] [-Your Amir Mahajne?!] [-No.] [Then why? Why?!] [Tell me.] [Tell me!] [Do you love him?] [Do you?] [Do you?] PALESTINE PREVENTIVE SECURITY HQ RAMALLAH [Hold it. Where to?] [Where is Abu Maher?] [He's busy at the moment, he can't see anyone now.] [Yes, he can, and I need to see him at once.] [I told you, he's busy. He can't see you now.] [I can take a message if you want.] [-A message?] [-A ha.] [-Here's my message.] [-Whoa!] [Who do you think you are, you little shit?!] [I'll blow your brains out all over the walls.] [To hell with you, Abu Ahmad and Abu Samara.] [You can all suck my dick!] [Come here again, and I'll slaughter you, you swine!] [Enough!] [Don't do anything you'll regret.] [Good, you're here.] [We won't have to look for you. You're going to jail.] [Do whatever you like,] [but first hear me out.] [-He killed two of your men?] [-Two of our bravest.] [And he had an affair with an engaged woman from your family?] [He violated my honor and my family's honor.] [Hold on.] [Najib.] [Yes?] [Walid told me some very disturbing things.] [What is it?] [Seems that one of our guys killed two of his guys.] [-Very disturbing indeed.] [-That's not all.] [He's also having an affair with an engaged woman.] [But that's forbidden.] [That's what I told Walid.] [Did he give you the name of our guy?] [Tell him.] [Amir Mahajne.] [Why are you laughing?] [Go get the USB.] [I don't know who he's killed or fucked,] [but I'll tell you two things:] [Amir Mahajne is a Jew,] [and you and your friend recruited him, not us.] [Want to hear him speak Hebrew?] [-Ready?] [-Yes, I'm ready.] There's one thing we need to clear first. [What is it?] [Does the name Taufiq Hammed sound familiar?] [The Panther.] [-He's waiting for you.] [-In heaven.] [He's closer than you think.] [You're going to meet the Panther.] [Where?] [I don't know.] [They wouldn't even tell me.] [You'll get the details on the way.] [Hold on.] [-What's up?] [-Did you leave already?] [We're about to set out.] [Can the volunteer hear me?] [-No.] [-Good. Listen.] [I'm about to tell you something surprising.] [-So stay calm and act natural.] [-I'm listening.] [-Ready?] [-Talk.] [The volunteer is a Jew.] [Elaborate.] [He's an Israeli soldier.] [A spy,] [-from the counter-terrorism unit.] [-I see.] [Now listen carefully:] [Take all of his belongings and throw them away,] [as far away as possible, it's important.] [What else?] [After that, put a bullet through his head.] [-Are you sure?] [-100%.] [Alright.] [Change of plan.] [-We leave in 30 minutes.] [-Is something wrong?] [No, not at all.] [That's how the Panther works,] [always changing things at the last minute, to be on the safe side.] [Don't worry. This is your big day.] [Wait here, I'll be right back.] The cigarette packet is moving. He's on his way. Nabil, Samah might be on the move, he's in a pickup truck, it's go time. -Nurit, where is he? -Stay on his tail, he's turning right. -There he is. -Relax, Steve, this isn't a pursuit. Okay. Pass the pickup. Take it easy. Steve, slow down! How come we didn't see him leave? Nabil, close in on the pickup. Make sure Samah is in there. -If I get too close, we'll be exposed. -Do as I told you! Fuck this shit. Okay, pass the vehicle. Fuck! Samah isn't inside the pickup. -What? -He's not inside the pickup! Go back to the junkyard, they tricked us! Turn around, quick! Now, drive! [-Now it's your turn.] [-Are we leaving?] [Shut up.] You wanted to be a hero, huh? Now you will die here like a dog, you filthy Jew! [-What are you talking about?] [-What am I talking about?] [Don't die as a liar, die as a hero, as a man who fears God.] [On your knees. Now!] Get down, I said! [-Do you fear God? Do you?!] [-Yes.] [Pray to Him.] ["There is no god but God] [and Muhammad is the messenger of God."] Pray to your own God. "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One. Blessed be the name of the glory of His kingdom forever and ever." [Is it not a fact that there was a time] [when the human being was nothing to be mentioned?] [We created the human from a liquid mixture,] [from two parents in order to test him...] [thus, we made him a hearer and a seer.] [We prepared for the disbelievers] [chains, shackles, and a blazing Hell] [Why are you here early? Where's the volunteer?] [Come, I have something to show you.] [You won't believe your eyes.] [Abu Maher's men caught this guy when he left our quarters.] [They were sure he's one of our guys.] [They sent Captain Ayub over to interrogate him.] [Look what they uncovered.] What are you doing here? -Gabi, what are you doing here?! -I'm here on a field day. [They're friends.] -I met him. -Who? Abu Ahmad. I met him. I've reached them, I'm deep inside the system. -They don't realize who I am. -Doron -- I can wipe him out right now, I can finish him, Gabi. I'm taking you home. [Warden!] -Are you okay, bro? -Go away. -Do you fuck her in my house? -Does it matter? It does, to me. I asked if you fucked her in my house. Forget it, it's not about you. Who is it about then, when you fuck my wife in my own house? You know I'm not that type of person. You're exactly that type. You've always been. -Always a traitor. -A traitor who just saved your ass! I should be killing you right now! Then why don't you? Shoot me in the head! Do it! You want the gun? Huh?! Do you love her? I do. Do you? -Doron, it's the third time it's ringing. -Give it to me. [-Hello?] [-Hello, Khaled?] [No, Khaled has left.] [He'll be back soon.] [-Is this Samah?] [-Yes.] [Is he dead?] [Just so you know, we're not the ones who killed him.] [What's the difference?] [In the end one lives and one dies. Right?] [-Who is it?] [-Amir.] [It's over. No need to hide.] [The nightmare is over.] [-What about Walid?] [-He's alive.] [Let's get you out of here.] [-Are you hungry?] [-You have no idea.] -How are you? -Fine, and you? Good, thanks. [-Care to order?] [-Sure.] [I'd like to order breakfast, please.] [I'd also like--] What are you doing here? -Gabi, what are you doing here?! -I'm here on a field day. -I met him. -Who? Abu Ahmad. I met him. I've reached them, I'm deep inside the system. -They don't realize who I am. -Doron-- And some coffee with cream. [Warden!]
