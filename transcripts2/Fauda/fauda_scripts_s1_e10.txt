 -What are you doing here? -Gabi, what are you doing here?! I'm here on a field day. Listen... -I met him. -Who? Abu Ahmad. I met him. I've reached them, I'm deep inside the system. They don't realize who I am. -Doron-- -I can wipe him out right now. -I could finish him, Gabi. -Don't worry. I'm taking you home. [ARABIC] [Warden!] [You owe me for seeing you, this early in the morning.]

 [What brings you here?] [I owe you one.] [FYI, those are the best hours of the day.] [Don't you prefer to interrogate him here?] [No one will see him.] [No, it's okay. I'll do it in my facility.] [In two hours we'll know who he is and where he's from.] [Well, I'll send you there with two armed guards.] [There's no need. Just have him handcuffed.] [Look.] [He had these in his pockets.] [Tell your guy to quit snooping around us,] [or he really will die as a Shahid next time.] [If you knew about it, why didn't you tell me before I got here?]

 [I didn't know.] Give me the red cell phone. Do you realize that you're insane? What do you think you're doing? I'm one phone call away from finishing Abu Ahmad. Not when the Defense Minister is having you arrested! Gabi, I've delved really deep into The Territories this past week. -I met Abu Ahmad. -How exactly? He recruited me as his suicide bomber. You need a psychiatrist, you're delusional. Oh, yeah? Then why did Abu Mahr arrest me? Why did he arrest me? He said you volunteered for a Hamas operation. There you go. I hope you brought the red cell phone. -It's here. -Good. Walid Al-Abed gave it to me. He's supposed to call and tell me where they're picking me up. -Doron, no one will believe that. -You do. Everyone knows that Abu Ahmad meets with his martyrs before an attack. What's your plan? To blow yourself up with him? Welcome to your luxury suite, sir. You can order room service, back rubs, courtesy of Gideon Avital. You can also try to escape, but you'll be shot. I guess a tip is out of the question, huh? What do you say? What do I say? I say that trying out as a Hamas suicide bomber - no one made it this far. Neither our unit, nor the Mossad or anywhere else. It's worthless without the cell phone. Your phone is in good hands, relax. -Gabi, let me finish the job. -I'll see what I can do. In the meantime, rest, take a shower, order movies. [Go play with yourself.] Here you go. [-Taufiq.] [-Abu Halil.] [Taufiq, my friend.] [How are you?] [Praise God. And you?] [Abu Halil is back from the cold.] [Are you kidding? Temperatures in Amman reach 104 degrees.] [You can hardly breathe there.] [Did they give you a hard time at the border?] [No, praise God, it went smoothly.] [What I don't get is, why they didn't suspect me.] [Thank God they didn't.] [Those damn Jews shoot judges too, not just children.] [Praise God.] [Guard this with extra care.] [Think carefully before you use it.] [It's best if you didn't use it at all.] [Don't worry, Abu Halil.] [It's all calculated.] [Thank you for your help, Abu Halil.] [-Thank you.] [-With all my love, brother.] [You remind me of when I was young,] [my delightful youth, before I started the business.] [That's why I only trust family. I trust no one else, Abu Halil.] [Speaking of family,] [the leaders in Amman asked that I give you this.] [That's all? Where's the rest?] [That's what they gave me.] [I guess our friends in Amman forgot that we're suffering here.] [They haven't forgotten.] [They know full well how much you sacrifice.] [Abu Halil.] [-Well well!] [-How are you?] [My dear Walid.] [-When did you get back?] [-Just now.] [-How have you been?] [-Fine, thank God.] [Do you still stutter?] [As a kid, he didn't speak a word.] [Not a single word.] [I thought he was a mute.] [What is it?] [I couldn't find her.] [I'll find her, don't worry.] It's a once in a lifetime shot, no one has ever gone this deep. He could call any minute, do you know that? And what's to guarantee that Abu Ahmad would meet with Doron? Abu Ahmad always meets with his bombers before an attack. He never passed it up even when we were on his tail. Gabi, you're no fool and neither is he. I'm fed up with that phantom and his mutinous acts. Me too, but he's in, it's a fact, so let's use that. -Are you trying to finish me? -It could help us all, even you. I won't risk the system for some crazy adventure, Gabi. The only one at risk is Doron Kabilio, and he's willing to go for it. The only place Doron Kabilio will go to is prison. After the operation. There is no operation, aren't you listening to me?! I'm pulling the plug on this guy's shenanigans. What are you doing here? You disappeared on me. I can't live without you. I mean it, Gali, I'm going crazy here. [Well... Is this good?] [Should I get you some more?] [This was behind the door that you were supposed to break.] [Still don't believe that your cousin is in cahoots with the Jews?] [She's a collaborator.] [We don't know who did that.] [Oh, must've been burglars inside the house.] [-Maybe Abu Samara did it.] [-Or you!] [-Me?] [-Yes.] [-Are you suspecting me?!] [-Yes!] [They got your cousin on their side, perhaps your entire family, too.] [-You think I'm a collaborator?] [-Yes!] [Stop defending her.] [She just got back from France, what do you know about her?] [Everything. I've known her all my life.] [What if she had connections with the damn Jews back in France?] [How would you know?!] [Where is she?] [I don't know. I'll find her.] [I'll leave no stone unturned. She's a disgrace to our family.] [Walid, be a man and a Palestinian fighter.] [Clear your name by killing her with your own bare hands.] [Understood?] [Shirin, open up.] [-Open the door before I kick it in.] [-Hold on.] [We were in your apartment.] [And?] [You left quite a mess there.] [They tried to kill me.] [Why do you need Amir Mahajne?] [-What do you want from me?] [-Abu Ahmad sent me.] [Are you here to kill me?] [As a kid, I'd wait for you to fly back from Paris for the holidays] [and take me to the park.] [I love you.] [Before you, I never knew what love is.] [Walid, I don't know what to say.] [You don't have to say anything, just say "yes".] [-"Yes"?] [-Yes.] [To what?] [To marrying me.] [Walid...] [You don't need guys from the Palestine Preventive Security to protect you.] [I will protect you.] [-It's your only chance to survive.] [-That's no reason to get married.] [Looks like a good reason to me. No one would dare harm my wife.] [-What about Abu Ahmad?] [-Not even he. No one.] [It's not enough. You're still a kid to him.] [Stop calling me a kid!] [Shirin, do you trust me?] [What do you say?] [-About what?] [-About being my wife.] [-I have to think about it.] [-Okay.] [Think about it as long as you need.] [Alright.] Nassrin, the operation went perfectly. We need to examine the eye in a day or two, but I think it's safe to say that Abir will be able to see. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. When can I take her home? She needs to stay for three or four days. -Wow, that long? -We need to examine, to see that there is no infection, that everything works. If I take her to Nablus Hospital, can I take her sooner? Maybe in two days. She shouldn't move so much before that. Let's see how she's doing in two days and then decide. Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. -You're welcome. All the best. -Thank you. [My God...] [Happy?] [Praise Allah.] [You know, you could end this whole nightmare.] [You could be living in Berlin, Paris, wherever you choose,] [with your children and Abu Ahmad.] [Sure...] [We don't want your husband here,] [and if we could arrange to get him out of here] [secretly and quietly, it would be worth it to us.] [And you'd kill him the first chance you get.] [Absolutely not.] [He wouldn't be the first one who gets paid to disappear.] [He'd never go for it.] [Neither would your Defense Minister.] [He already said "yes".] [He's the father of my children. I won't turn him in.] [You want me to turn him in for my children's sake, right?] [As if you really care about them.] [You know how much it would weaken him.] [The poor man moves from hideout to hideout like a rat.] [You want us to leave for Berlin so you could weaken him and kill him.] [-It's for your children's sake.] [-Do my children mean that much to you?] [Please, Captain Ayub, I'm no fool.] HAMAS BUREAUS NORTHERN RAMALLAH [I'm listening.] [I've been thinking.] [The Abu Ahmad of today isn't the Abu Ahmad of yesterday.] [Meaning?] [He should be finished.] [I won't stand in your way.] [I'll tell you when and where, and you'll catch him.] [It's important that you do it with your own hands.] [You're the only one who can get near him.] [Put a bullet through his brain and make sure he's dead,] [so that we end his miraculous "resurrections".] [-You expect me to kill him?!] [-Who then?] [-But I can't--] [-Walid.] [I won't do your work for you.] [You're the only one who can come near him.] [Quietly.] [Without being noticed.] [Take this.] [An Israeli soldier sold it to us.] [Are you with me?] [Say that the house was under attack] [and that you managed to get away,] [but he wasn't as lucky, and that the IDF killed him.] [It'll be our secret] [and we'll take it to our graves.] [I know.] [Abu Ahmad was a hero to all of us,] [but his prestige is being diminished by his conduct.] [He leaves us no choice.] [-But I can't do it.] [-Why not?] [You know what? Think of it this way:] [You would be doing him a favor.] [If he lives, he would be making a fool of himself,] [but if he dies while we're at war with the Jews...] [...his name won't be tarnished.] [What is it, Abu Amir?] [Hello?] [-Are you alone?] [-Yes.] [My darling. How is she?] She's in recovery. [The doctor said she's a very lucky girl.] [Her eye was completely saved.] [God bless her doctor.] [When will you be back?] [I don't know.] [Nassrin, we need to talk.] [I can explain what happened.] [I don't want any explanations now.] [-I just want my daughter to recover.] [-Of course, God willing.] [I miss her and Ahmad.] [And I miss you too.] [God willing.] [-I'm going home.] [-Sure thing.] [As soon as you can, of course.] [I'm going back to Berlin with the children.] [What?] [What do you mean?] [I can't take this anymore.] [This time Abir was lucky, but who knows what will be next time?] [Nassrin, but we're a family.] [You can't just decide that on your own. We'll talk.] [My children deserve to live a normal life and that won't be possible here.] [I never had a normal life, but I've dedicated my life] [-to give my children a chance at normalcy.] [-I know you have,] [and I truly appreciate and respect what you're doing,] [but you've put me in a tough spot.] [I'm supposed to choose between your life and my children's lives.] [Nassrin, please, I beg you.] [You've forgotten about us. You've abandoned your children,] [you were willing to sacrifice Abir. Don't you realize that?] [Nassrin, please, let's just meet for five minutes.] [Alright.] [But it has to be as soon as possible.] [Fine. Take the phone with you.] [When you leave the hospital, one of my men will tell you where to go.] [Okay.] [Allahu Akbar.] [May the exalted Allah receive my prayers] [May the merciful Allah bring peace upon us all.] [Did you find her?] [No.] [I'll be right there.] [You hear, Walid?] [One day, the Jews will catch me.] [They're getting closer and closer.] [If not them, it will be Abu Samara.] [And if not Abu Samara, then it'll be one of my men.] [I want you to be prepared to replace me.] [You don't know how hard it is to be me.] [Walid, you are like a son to me. You know that.] [Do you know what this is?] [What is it?] [It's what the chosen one will take with him tomorrow.] [Abu Samara and his cowardly friends will never see it coming.] [-But what is it?] [-You'll know soon enough.] [You know that I never keep anything from you,] [but this time it's for your own good.] [I want you to trust me completely.] [Okay?] I'm not eating, I'm chewing gum. So go tell Mom. Good thing we're divorced. Too bad you can't divorce her, that's true. No, I'll be there at around 9 p.m. Gotta go. [Hello?] [-Samah?] [-No, I'm his brother. Samah isn't here.] [He left this phone with me. Who is it?] [When will he be back?] [In an hour.] [I'll call again in an hour.] [Alright.] Why an hour? I'm such an idiot, why didn't I say "two hours"? I'm your brother. What? I told the guy on the phone that I'm your brother, so if he asks-- Yiftah, what's up? No, there's a lamb chop and rice in the fridge. But don't warm it up in the microwave oven, okay? You can microwave the rice, but warm the lamb chop in a pan. I know, you've got basketball practice at 6:30 p.m. It doesn't matter if he's taller than you, if you push him with your butt, he'll miss the hoop. Okay, buddy, I gotta go. Oh, and don't put ketchup on it, or I'll kill you. Bye, Yiftah, buddy. Hello? [I'm Samah.] I'm sorry, it won't happen again. [Do you understand that you must follow our exact orders?] [I do, I apologize.] [No problem.] [Now, listen carefully.] [Tomorrow at 10 a.m, be at the old market in Beitunia.] [Wait there, someone will pick you up. Understood?] [Understood.] [Don't say your goodbyes to anyone.] [-Don't do anything out of the ordinary.] [-Okay.] [May Allah be with you.] [Goodbye.]
