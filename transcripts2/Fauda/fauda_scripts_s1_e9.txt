 Moreno? Bro? Are you okay? -Pass it to me. -Here you go. -Are you listening? Can I talk? -Shoot. I found replacements for Avihai and Steve. Both special operations fighters. Great. Have you got a replacement for me too? -Gideon shut down the unit. -What?! We're all out. So are you. Got a cigarette? -Moreno, talk to him. -It's pointless.

 Have you got a cigarette or not? C'mon, Moreno, it's not the time to do this, when God-knows who's got Doron out there in The Territories. Since when do you care about Doron? What do you mean? He was my commander. But you could never stand him. When he rejoined the unit, I saw in your eyes you wanted to die. Well, it doesn't matter now. I can't believe Gideon would chuck his friends just like that. We're not friends. You saved his ass countless times, haven't you? You're friends. One must never forget his friends. PALESTINE PREVENTIVE SECURITY HQ RAMALLAH Relax, Eran. Breathe. [ARABIC] [-Hey, how are you?]

 [-Hello and welcome.] [-How are you?] [How are you, my friend?] [-Have a seat.] [-Thanks.] [What brings you here, Captain Ayub?] [Najib, will it be much longer?] [We want you to catch Abu Ahmad and hand him to us.] [That murderer is on the loose, making fun of you and us.] [You want Abu Ahmad?] [I thought you killed him.] [Thank you, God bless you. Have some coffee.] [-Thanks.] [-Drink up.] [That jackass still works for you?] [Here you go.] [I'm under a lot of pressure from my superiors.] [I don't want that to happen, but if you don't hand him to us,] [I won't be able to stop them. They'll start by retracting their approval] [for your brother's resort, just to break your spirit.] [Wouldn't that be a shame?] [You and I go back many years.] [So don't use my brother's resort to threaten me.] [You think I don't know that he works for you guys?] [Listen to me carefully.] [I sat in your prison for 17 years,] [but I never feared you people, and I don't intend to start now.] [Abu Mahr, you know that I have the highest regard for you.] [If you want my help with the crappy situation you and Taufiq Hammed created,] [no problem, I'll try to help,] [but he must stop snooping around us, trying to become a hero.] [Things are worse than you think. We know for sure that Abu Ahmad] [is planning a massive attack, 9/11 style.] [He has named the operation Al Buraq.] [The plan is to take down several towers.] [If he succeeds, it will hurt your side as well as ours.] [See to it that Gideon Avital approves my brother's resort,] [and don't forget the armored vehicles you promised us 20 years ago.] [Consider it done. I'm on it.] [Look, all I know is that he has meetings with the crazies.] [But I'm not exactly sure what he's up to.] [We'll be in touch.] [I have three children, the youngest is five months old,] [and my brother and I own an electric supplies shop.] [Why do you want to be a Shahid?] [When I was young, I lived in a room with Fatah students from Bir Zeit,] [but since then, I got married and had children,] [and sadly, was steered away from the sacred cause.] [What made you reconsider?] [Five years ago I started having marriage trouble,] [my wife is a handful,] [and also, my brother and I started having business quarrels.] [I met with the Sheikh, and he patched things up between my wife and me,] [and solved my business problems with my brother.] [He also told me what the Prophet expects of us.] [Since the Sheikh died, I can't sleep.] [The Sheikh will be greatly missed.] [Are you still a Fatah member?] [No. I realized that the Fatah doesn't care about its people.] [-But you're not like them.] [-That's right.] [I want my family to get a new house instead of the one that'll be destroyed,] [plus a monthly income of 6,000 shekels.] [I will have it checked out.] [But aren't you scared of dying?] [There is no better fate than to die a Shahid.] [That's true.] [Well, thanks for coming.] [-I'll be right back.] [-May God be with you.] [He's just right, isn't he?] [-No.] [-Why not?] [He's in it for the money.] [If the Jews gave him 100 shekels, he'd work for them.] [We should keep our distance from him.] [I want you to find the right man for the Al Buraq operation.] [A man who would feel humbled in the face of death.] [-Now, leave.] [-Where to?] [We're done here.] [But Abu Ahmad, it doesn't work that way.] [You can't stay here.] [-They could find you any minute.] [-Things are different now.] [They strapped an explosive belt on my kid, they blew up the Sheikh.] [-I know, but still...] [-Walid, I'm done living like a rat.] [If God wants me, he can take me.] [That will be all. Go.] [Get out, now!] [-Peace be upon you.] [-Upon you be peace.] [Shut the door, Walid.] [-Peace be upon you.] [-Upon you be peace.] [Go with Nidal to Dr. Shirin.] [She's collaborating with the Jews.] [Then dump her body at Almanarah Square.] [Alright.] [Thanks.] [Well, I'll go take a shower.] [You slut! You're betraying us with the Jews!] [It's not me, really, it's not me.] [-What is it, pal?] [-Go back!] [I said, go back!] [Who sent you?] [-Who sent you?] [-No one.] [You've got three seconds to answer.] [One, two...] [Abu Ahmad! Abu Ahmad!] [Where is he?] [I don't know.] [I'll kill you like I killed your friend.] [Where is he? Think!] [-Last time I saw him he was in the hall.] [-Where is it?] [If you want to live, think harder!] [Yassmin neighborhood, in Nablus' old city.] [What is he doing there?] [What is he doing there?] [Interviewing volunteers for carrying out suicide attacks.] [What do volunteers have to say when they get there?] [-What do they say?] [-They say, "I want to meet the teacher."] [-The teacher?] [-Yes, I swear to God.] [I believe you.] [Why did you do that?!] [Your life is in danger, come with me.] [-I'm not coming.] [-Come with me!] I'll call you right back. Good morning, can I help you? No, thanks. Do you have an appointment with the Minister? No, there's no way I'll make it in time. I'll get back to you. Forgot something, Moreno? Why so smug? It's been ages since I enjoyed the morning paper. They're burying you alive. All thanks to you. Sorry to have to say this, Gideon, but if you don't reassemble the unit and my team, I'll have a press conference and describe in full detail about the five captives that you and I shot in the head in Gaza. Have we resorted to blackmail, Moreno? Say what you will, but your political career will be over. You'll never shake off the headline that will hit the newsstands globally: "The Israeli Defense Minister killed five Palestinian captives in cold blood." Did you really think I'd sit back while you destroy my career? Is that how you know me after all these years? You idiot. I'm the one who swept up all the shit you left behind. Never ever forget who your real friends are. [-God be with you.] [-Thank you.] [We need a room.] [-One room?] [-Yes.] [One bed or two?] [-Whichever.] [-So, two.] [200 shekels a night, you pay up front.] [-Thank you.] [-You're welcome.] [Come.] [-Hello?] [-Walid?] [Your cousin the doctor just got a room at my hotel, with a guy.] [What?!] [It will really shame your family when they get word of it.] [Just shut up and don't tell anyone about it, you hear?] [Where's your cousin, that slut?] [I ask that you please not call her that.] [-Why not? Because she's a slut?] [-What do you want from her?] [Don't worry, I have plans for her.] [Problem is, I sent Bassam and Nidal over to her, and they're gone.] [You sent those two lunatics to her house?] [-Now you're telling me who to send?] [-But she's my cousin!] [I won't let you harm my relatives without telling me.] [-Is that so?] [-Yes.] [Listen to me, Walid, my friend. I suggest you calm down,] [because I will harm anything that would ruin my plan.] [-So your plan is to ruin my family?] [-Anyone who puts it at risk,] [be it your relative,] [Abu Samara, you, or your mother.] [Understood?] [Understood?!] [Understood.] [So I'm telling you again, go get your damn cousin] [and don't come back until you find her.] [-How is she?] [-I don't know.] [Relax, she's in good hands.] [After the surgery, do you want me to buy you all tickets to Berlin?] [-No.] [-Why not?] [I can't.] [-Because of him?] [-There is no him.] [I told you, he's dead.] [I thought we were talking seriously.] [If he were dead, Abir wouldn't be in this predicament.] [You know what? Let's play "pretend".] [Let's pretend that your husband is actually dead.] [You could leave without him.] [You and your children could be off to Berlin.] [A new beginning,] [no Jews, no Arabs, no war.] [Suppose I'm interested...] [What must I do to make it happen?] [Help me catch his ghost.] [This time, your daughter ended up in a hospital because of him.] [Who knows how it will end next time?] [You can elude death one day,] [but it will find you the next day.] [Besides, he'd never leave with you.] [But on the other hand, he won't let you go alone.] [Our only hope is to catch him.] [It's for his own good too.] [If he's our prisoner, we can't kill him,] [and some day he will be released.] [They are all released in the end. We released Sheikh Yassin, too.] [And then you finished him with an air strike.] [A poor old man in a wheelchair.] [You will hear God's wrath.] [-Nassrin, my dear.] [-Your dear?] [Listen, I've been divorced twice.] [I have five children, God bless them,] [but I come back to an empty house,] [and sleep in a big, cold bed.] [I'm alone, every day.] [-If I had a woman like you--] [-Captain Ayub, please!] [To each his destiny in life.] [It's all written by the hand of Allah.] [I don't believe in that.] [One can change his own destiny.] [Take your time. Think about it.] [What are you doing?] [-I have to be at work in 40 minutes.] [-They'll manage without you.] [-There's no reason for that.] [-Abu Ahmad could have you killed.] [Do not go anywhere, and don't open the door until I come back.] [But why would Abu Ahmad want to kill me?] [I'll talk to him.] [Sit down.] [Abu Ahmad thinks you sold him out to the Jews,] [and that you put his kid in the hospital and got the Sheikh killed.] [Don't hurt my cousin Walid.] [He's just a foolish boy.] [Wait for me here.] [Hello.] [-May I come in?] [-Who are you?] [Samakh Tamimi. I have a meeting.] [-With whom?] [-With the teacher.] [-God be with you.] [-Thanks.] [Spread your arms.] [-Sit down and wait here.] [-What for?] [Until they call you.] [-How long will it take?] [-I don't know. You can leave, if you want.] [-No, I'll wait. Here?] [-Here.] [Shirin, open the door.] [Shirin, I know you're in there, open the door, it's Walid.] [How did you know I was here?] [You can't hide from us. Open up.] [-Shirin, open the door.] [-Why are you here?] [I need to talk to you.] [Shirin, I would never harm you.] [I won't do a thing, I swear to God. Now, open up.] [Shirin, I'm here to help you. Open up.] [You sent people to have me killed.] [Do you honestly think I would do that?] [Abu Ahmad sent them.] [He thinks you told the Jews about the operation.] [How would I even tell them that?] [I know nothing about it.] [I know, that's why I'm here to help you.] [Now, open the door.] [What does he want from me? Why send people to kill me?] [Shirin, you must tell me exactly what went on.] [-What did those people want from you?] [-They're dead.] [How did they die?] [Amir Mahajne killed them.] [Who's Amir Mahajne?] [He's from the Palestine Preventive Security.] [-What's he got to do with you?] [-He protects me for real,] [unlike you, who got me involved in this nightmare.] [Do you really think a guy from the Palestine Preventive Security,] [-could shield you from Abu Ahmad?] [-Yes.] [-Well, you couldn't be more wrong.] [-Fine.] [-Who is he? How does he know you?] [-It's a long story.] [What did you tell him?] [Nothing.] [So he just happened to be at your place when Abu Ahmad's men came for you?] [-Just like that?] [-I think he just came to see if I'm okay] [after you blew up the Jew.] [-Did he touch you?] [-Excuse me?!] [Did you sleep with him? Are you insane?!] [What are you talking about?!] [I refused to believe it until I got to this dingy hotel and found out] [you're fucking that piece of shit from the Palestine Preventive Security.] [Get out of here. Who do you think you are? Get out!] [Do you love him?] [You're out of your mind.] [Get out of here!] [-Shame on you!] [-No, you should be ashamed!] [Your friend Abu Ahmad wants me wiped out.] [I'm the only one who can protect you.] [Fine, go ahead, protect me.] [You got him into my life, now get him out.] [-Hey, Walid.] [-Hi.] [We have a volunteer waiting for an appointment.] [We checked him out, he's clear.] [-Did you check everything?] [-He's clear.] [-What's his name?] [-Samakh Tamimi.] [-Where from?] [-Nabi Salih village.] [His family owns a butcher shop, I know them.] [Should he come back in an hour?] [-Is he here? Did you tell him?] [-Yes.] [Okay, thanks. Godspeed.] [-Peace be upon you.] [-May the all merciful Allah bless you.] [Do you know why you're here?] [I'm here for the sacred cause.] [It's my time to die.] [Why are you here?] [I have no other way to take revenge on them.] [But why you of all people?] [Because they blew up my brother-in-law right before my eyes.] [Pieces of his flesh flew right before my eyes.] [All that's left for me to do is to avenge his death.] [Why?] [Only then will I find solace.] [-Sorry to hear that.] [-Thank you.] [I'll take it from here.] [-Peace be upon you.] [-May the all merciful Allah bless you.] [I see you're nervous.] [It's understandable, you're here for a very complex mission.] [It's scary.] [I'm not scared.] [I know you're not scared.] [You're not afraid to die.] [You and death sleep in the same bed.] [You've killed before, huh?] [I have.] [But death and killing are two different things.] [It's my time to die.] [Is there anything you want to do before that?] [No.] [You're not telling the truth now, that's a lie.] [What are you hiding from me?] [I have no home to go back to.] [But you have a wife and children.] [There's no place for me in my own home.] [A man has no place at home after letting down his own family.] [I'm sure that they love you.] [I promise that your brother-in-law's death will be avenged.] [We can't take this anymore, we're fed up.] [I had to make sure you're right for us, that you won't fall apart at go time.] [God willing, they'll call you.] [Be ready around the clock, and don't leave Nablus.] [You'll get a call in a few days, when it's go time.] [Good.] [It was an honor to meet you.] [We will meet again.] [Got a light?] [What's your name?] [Amir Mahajne.] [Is that so? Amir Mahajne?] [Who do you work for, Amir Mahajne?] [The Palestine Preventive Security.] [What's your name and who do you work for?] [I'm Amir Mahajne, and I'm from the Palestine Preventive Security.] [If you harm me, my friends will--] [You jackass, we are the Palestine Preventive Security!] [What's the goal of our operation?] [I don't know.] [-Where will you get an explosive belt?] [-I don't know.] [Did you meet Abu Ahmad in person?] [Abu Ahmad is dead.] [Just wait, you son of a bitch.] [You'll be confessing to everything you know,]
