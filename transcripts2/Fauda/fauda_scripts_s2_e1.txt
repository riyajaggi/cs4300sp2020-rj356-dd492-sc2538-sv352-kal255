I guess ‫‫he wants to question me about you.] ‫‫[But don't worry, I fled to Hebron.] ‫‫[Don't meet with him.] ‫‫[What's the problem?] ‫‫[I have no choice but to meet with him. ‫‫The Sheikh will kill me.] ‫‫No location reading. ‫‫[Well, may God be with you.] ‫‫[Just wanted to update you.] ‫‫[Where will you meet with him?] ‫‫[I don't know, ‫‫but the Sheikh said in Jerusalem.] ‫‫Hang up. ‫‫[-Well, goodbye, then.] ‫‫[-Hold on.] ‫‫[Tell him to go to Nablus.] ‫‫[Alone.] ‫‫[He won't do it.] ‫‫[Tell him you know ‫‫who tried to take him down,] ‫‫[and he will come.] ‫‫[There's a cafe ‫‫near the Great Mosque of Nablus] ‫‫[Friday, before the prayer.] ‫‫-Well? ‫‫-I can't make out a location. ‫‫Maybe he's using a scrambler. ‫‫Tell him to get back to him tomorrow ‫‫-and say that you want to meet in Hawara. ‫‫-He won't do it. Make it Nablus. ‫‫Forget it, Doron. ‫‫He wants to meet by the mosque, ‫‫-it's a whole different ball game. ‫‫-He won't show up. ‫‫I don't like this. ‫‫Let's get it over with, Gabi. ‫‫If he wants it to be Nablus, ‫‫make it Nablus. Trust me. ‫‫-I'm going to talk to Moreno. ‫‫-"Trust me," my ass... ‫‫You clown, ‫‫don't you watch where you're going? ‫‫Sorry. ‫‫"Sorry"? ‫‫Do you know where you are? ‫‫No, where am I? Is this place secret? ‫‫Just get on your bike and scram. ‫‫Open up. ‫‫Dude, we said we'd go for a light jog. ‫‫That was a light jog, Avihai. ‫‫-Doron! What are you doing here? ‫‫-Don't come near me. ‫‫I'm not. Bro, I won't touch you. ‫‫-Don't touch me. ‫‫-I won't. ‫‫Ugh, you're so gross. ‫‫-How have you been, man? ‫‫-Alright. ‫‫So you're Doron, huh? ‫‫I've heard about you. ‫‫You have? Good. ‫‫-Who's the cutie? ‫‫-Sagi, he's new. He'll get used to us. ‫‫The Sheikh's son, huh? ‫‫Doron, you just won't go away, huh? ‫‫Look, I know it's a far-fetched plan, ‫‫but the only way to reach him ‫‫is if I'm there. ‫‫As bait? Are you nuts? ‫‫He won't come out of hiding ‫‫unless he sees me with his own eyes. ‫‫Is that what Gabi told you? ‫‫Don't do it, don't listen to him. ‫‫It's not Gabi, Moreno. It's me. ‫‫He's no ordinary terrorist. ‫‫He tried to kill my dad, and if he came ‫‫this close to him, my kids could be next. ‫‫Listen, ‫‫I don't like this. ‫‫I think it's a lousy plan, ‫‫that it's a hole I don't know ‫‫how we can dig ourselves out of, ‫‫and that it puts you at risk, but... ‫‫but for you, bro, whatever you say. ‫‫Thank you. ‫‫-Who is it? ‫‫-Who? ‫‫God damn you, I almost dropped the meat! ‫‫-How's it going? ‫‫-Pretty good, bro. ‫‫[Salam aleikum, buddy.] ‫‫Who let you in here, anyway? ‫‫-I spoke with Moreno. ‫‫-And? ‫‫I'm joining you guys for one operation. ‫‫Are you nuts? You mean, you're back? ‫‫Of course not. Just for one operation. ‫‫Admit it, you're sick of fucking sheep. ‫‫"One operation," my ass. ‫‫Idiot. Move over. ‫‫I'll show you how to barbecue. ‫‫Son of a bitch. ‫‫-What's going on? ‫‫-It's not working and it stinks like hell. ‫‫-I was referring to Doron. ‫‫-We have no choice. ‫‫So he's your solution? ‫‫Give me a few hours. ‫‫You think I want him here? ‫‫I don't trust him for shit. ‫‫But Kaspi and Ayub set this up. ‫‫Our hands are tied. ‫‫Everything Doron gets involved in ‫‫ends badly. ‫‫-Don't worry, he'll do as I tell him. ‫‫-Yeah, right. ‫‫You should've told me ‫‫you were bringing him here. ‫‫-He came here on his own. ‫‫-Of course. ‫‫Look, you two might not like it, ‫‫but he's our best and fastest shot ‫‫at taking down Al Makdasi. ‫‫Five people were already killed. ‫‫-Does he know I'm replacing you? ‫‫-What's that got to do with it? ‫‫-I don't like the guy. ‫‫-Well, neither do I! ‫‫Off you go, ‫‫we have a lot of work to do, right? ‫‫Don't worry, it'll be alright. ‫‫I promise. ‫‫Listen, I have someone ‫‫I want to introduce to you. ‫‫-You jerk. ‫‫-No, really, he's totally cute. ‫‫Alright, folks... ‫‫-Hey, can we focus? ‫‫-Just hear me out. ‫‫-Steve, come on. ‫‫-He's a moron. ‫‫-Is he trying to set you up with someone? ‫‫-Yes. ‫‫-It's about time, isn't it? ‫‫-Listen up. ‫‫Sagi, I'd like you to meet Doron, ‫‫who will be joining the operation. ‫‫Doron used to be a fighter in the unit ‫‫until he decided he'd rather grow olives. ‫‫-Grapes. ‫‫-Grapes. ‫‫And now he's a goat herder. ‫‫-Shepherd. ‫‫-Shepherd. ‫‫This is Sagi, our latest recruit ‫‫from unit 2735. ‫‫Yeah, we met earlier. ‫‫What a heartwarming welcome... ‫‫So, we got the aerial shots ‫‫of the meeting's location. ‫‫We're regarding this operation ‫‫as an attempt by Al Makdasi ‫‫to take down Doron. ‫‫The meeting's problematic location ‫‫supports our general assumption ‫‫that this is a trap. ‫‫-What about a model plan? ‫‫-We won't be following one. ‫‫Why not? ‫‫'Cause it's not that ‫‫1-2-3-4-5-6-7 unit of yours. ‫‫You're right, it's wiser to just go in, ‫‫maybe they'll kidnap a unit member. ‫‫Sagi, cool it, will you? ‫‫It's an organized operation. ‫‫I'll serve as the on-field command post ‫‫along with Kaspi ‫‫and two drones above us. ‫‫In short, we're taking down ‫‫that bastard today. ‫‫Any questions? ‫‫Off you go. And behave. ‫‫Doron. ‫‫I'm glad you're here. I missed you. ‫‫-Didn't you miss me, too, Moreno? ‫‫-I take you for granted, Steve. ‫‫-Everything okay, bro? ‫‫-Yep. ‫‫You look good in black. ‫‫Thin. ‫‫Smile, bro. Don't worry, you won't die. ‫‫NABLUS, THE KASBAH ‫‫Copy, 300 is in position. ‫‫[I'm ready.] ‫‫[I'm ready. The area is clear.] ‫‫Doron, you have clearance. ‫‫[Peace be upon you.] ‫‫[-How are you? Everything alright?] ‫‫[-Praise God.] ‫‫[Come on, relax.] ‫‫[Everything will be fine, relax.] ‫‫[Drink your water.] ‫‫[He needs a good slap.] ‫‫[Two coffees, no sugar. Thanks.] ‫‫[If you hear anything, ‫‫duck under the chair, okay?] ‫‫[Let me go, you don't need me.] ‫‫[Thanks, buddy.] ‫‫[You bet I need you.] ‫‫[We're in a meeting.] ‫‫[Relax, everything will be fine.] ‫‫[Man, you people got me into such a mess.] ‫‫[Listen, pal, you're lucky ‫‫you're not in heaven right now.] ‫‫Any gunmen in sight? ‫‫This is 300, no visual ID. ‫‫Negative. ‫‫[I'm exposed here, ‫‫it's making me nervous.] ‫‫He'll be fine. ‫‫Steve? ‫‫[Everything seems calm.] ‫‫Sagi, on your left. ‫‫There's a man carrying a sack ‫‫at your 11 o'clock. ‫‫-Who's closest to that spot? ‫‫-Nabil. ‫‫Naor, ‫‫find out what the deal is with the sack. ‫‫Clean. ‫‫Damn it, he's totally exposed out there. ‫‫-Patience. ‫‫-Ten more minutes until I abort the mission. ‫‫This Izat guy ‫‫will end up blowing our cover. ‫‫[-Do you see him?] ‫‫[-Yes.] ‫‫He put down the bag. ‫‫[Steve, go see what's in that bag.] ‫‫He's coming back. ‫‫[He came back for it, it's okay.] ‫‫That does it. ‫‫Doron, I'm moving on to phase two. ‫‫[Wait a bit longer.] ‫‫I don't want Izat to lose it. ‫‫[Wait a bit longer.] ‫‫[What is it?] ‫‫[What is it?] ‫‫[What is it?] ‫‫[He's running away!] ‫‫Everyone, ‫‫stay put and keep your positions. ‫‫Motorcycle approaching from the east. ‫‫-What's going on there? ‫‫-He's dead. ‫‫See? It worked. ‫‫-God damn it, it's not him. ‫‫-It's not him! ‫‫Get into formation! Formation, now! ‫‫He's here! ‫‫RPG! ‫‫Direct hit to the cafe. ‫‫Can anyone identify ‫‫the shooter's location? ‫‫Al Makdasi is in the building! ‫‫300, he's one flight below you, ‫‫commence pursuit on foot! ‫‫Fuckers! ‫‫Fuck! ‫‫I lost him. He's on a motorcycle. ‫‫-Look. ‫‫-He's driving off from the other side. ‫‫Doron, right here! ‫‫We're on his tail. ‫‫We'll close in on him from the other side. ‫‫Drive! ‫‫Kaspi, take him down with the drone. ‫‫There are too many civilians. ‫‫Let them first reach an open space. ‫‫The drone better not lose sight of him. ‫‫-Where is he, Moreno? ‫‫-He's driving east on a parallel street. ‫‫You're getting close. ‫‫There he is! ‫‫Nurit, step on it! ‫‫Damn it! ‫‫-He's getting away. ‫‫-Yes, I can see that! ‫‫It's the street to our west. ‫‫Why is he turning back? Shit. ‫‫-Fuck! Whose jeep is this? ‫‫-Mine. ‫‫-Let's go. ‫‫-What are you doing?! ‫‫Give me directions, Kaspi. ‫‫Directions! ‫‫Moreno, advance north, ‫‫he's inside the alleyways. ‫‫Go, go, go! Doron, I'll close in on him ‫‫from the northwest side. ‫‫Push him towards me. ‫‫-Doron! ‫‫-Stop! ‫‫Go back! ‫‫He's on his way to you, Moreno. ‫‫-He's turning west. ‫‫-Turn left, Moreno! ‫‫I got him! Stay on his tail! ‫‫He's about to exit the city. ‫‫Moreno, keep pushing him. ‫‫Once he exits the city, ‫‫I'm taking him down with the drone. ‫‫Turn right. ‫‫Ayub, I'm closing in on the bastard, ‫‫I can finish him! ‫‫Force Commander is hit, ‫‫we need a chopper, stat! ‫‫Fuck... Fuck! ‫‫Moreno... Doron... ‫‫Doron, it's Moreno! ‫‫Doron, it's Moreno! ‫‫Force Commander, do you copy? Over. ‫‫Moreno, do you copy? Over. ‫‫Commander Europe from Bazelet. ‫‫We have two men down. ‫‫Most likely dead. ‫‫Requesting chopper on site. ‫‫Report to site, stat. ‫‫Commander Bazelet from Atalef, ‫‫cancel chopper dispatch. Over. ‫‫Translation: Hagit Harel
