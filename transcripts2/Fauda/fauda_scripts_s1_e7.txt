 [ARABIC] [You kidnapped the wrong guy.] [I didn't kidnap anyone.] [Look, the guy you caught has friends in high places,] [who will be on your case until he's released.] [You should be worried because he means a great deal to us.] [He's like our brother.] [And we won't stop killing. Listen carefully,] [we won't stop killing] [until he returns home, showers and eats his mom's cooking!] [So I'll ask you again,]

 [where is Abu Ahmad?] [In heaven, with the rest of the Shahids.] [When did you last see him?] [A year and a half ago. Four days before he was killed.] [I shot him on his brother's wedding day.] [If you don't tell me where Abu Ahmad is, I will kill you.] [I was born to die a Shahid, my son, whenever that may happen.] [You'll wish you had died a Shahid by the time I kill you.] [So I'm asking you one more time...] [I don't know where Abu Ahmad is.] [I swear I don't.] [May God have mercy on me, I don't know where Abu Ahmad is.] [I just want to do a prisoner swap between you and our friend.] [For both your sakes.]

 [I told you, I don't know where Abu Ahmad is!] [I'm listening.] [8 Yahya Ayyash street, Ramallah.] [It's near the Prime Minister's bureau, beneath ground level.] [I'll make sure they pay for what they've done.] [I bet those animals are interrogating him with torture.] [I think he'll buckle.] [We can't risk it. We must get out of here.] [Don't worry, he won't say a word.] [-He's only human. You never know.] [-Walid!] [You know how it is in captivity. In the end, everyone talks.] [Everyone but the Sheikh. He won't say a word.] [He was here in this house, you never know.] [We can't risk it. We must get out of here.] [Nassrin and the kids must hide.] [The Jews won't come near them.] [The Jews kidnapped Sheikh Awdallah,] [you never know what else could happen.] [-Nassrin would never agree anyway.] [-But there's no other choice.] [Yes, there is.] [I beg of you, Abu Ahmad, let's get out of here.] [I'm begging you.] [Alright.] [One more thing.] [Abu Samara wants to talk to you.] [-What does the son of a bitch want?] [-It's something about the soldier.] [Tell that piece of shit to go fuck himself.] [But we have to talk to him, we have no other choice.] [Again you say we have no choice?] [I won't talk to him.] [Give me your hand.] What? I don't know how you guys do it. How? Did you ever see a fight dog get an order to attack? Did you, Nurit? Yeah, in movies. What does it look like in the movies? He gets the command and immediately attacks. Exactly. He does it immediately. Nothing else matters to him. He pounces with the aim to kill. He doesn't care if his head gets chopped off doing it. We, Nurit... ...are just like those attack dogs. That's how we were trained. Fight dogs get beaten up and starved. We'd get beaten up each evening to build our resilience. When we hear the word "action" over the radio, we pounce. Don't you think about your wife? -Don't you think of your son Guy? -There is no Guy at those moments. There's nothing. We were trained not to think. You know why? Because if I stop to think about him for just a split second, I'll become petrified with fear. I won't be able to move. I don't want that to happen to me. It's like being dead. Then you don't belong here. You're putting us at risk. Fuck! Son of a bitch! Steve, when we go back, you and Nurit are going to guard his house. If you see his wife, kids, anything that moves, you tell me. -Got it? -Yes. [-Isn't he coming?] [-He really wants to, but...] [I want the Jew.] [-Abu Ahmad wanted--] [-Stop talking.] [Listen to me and pass it down to him.] [It's the soldier who killed his brother.] [I don't know who he killed,] [but we can't let people do as they please.] [Thousands of women are waiting for their husbands and sons.] [We want the soldier so we can release those prisoners.] [Abu Ahmad loves the Sheikh and wants him freed as soon as possible.] [That's why he wants to provoke a clashing within 24 hours.] [-Abu Ahmad has a plan.] [-He has a plan? Who the hell is he?] [Only the leadership makes the plans.] [We've all mourned relatives, but that doesn't mean he can do as he pleases.] [Abu Ahmad doesn't call the shots!] [Only the leadership!] [You've got 24 hours to bring him in.] [24 hours,] [not a minute more.] [Look at me.] [Tell Abu Ahmad to bring the soldier here,] [or I will see to it that he never disrupts the movement again.] [Ever.] [Understood?] [Understood?] [Understood.] [-Put it here.] [-No, here.] [-Where?] [-Here.] [Excuse me, Abu Ahmad.] [Hello?] [I'm coming to see him.] [-We're not there anymore.] [-As if I knew where you were.] [-Send someone to get me.] [-Why do you want to see him?] [He's post-op. I must check on him every three hours.] [I want to make sure there are no infections] [and to run tests.] [Are you giving him the antibiotics I left for you?] [Shirin, I have no time to play nurse. He's fine.] [-He might have a slight fever.] [-A fever is a sign of infection,] [which could lead to low blood pressure,] [and he could die.] [So unless you want him dying on your watch, let me see him.] [-I don't know...] [-Do it for me.] [For me.] [I'm losing sleep over it.] [Please, just let me see him to make sure he's alright.] [Just ten minutes. Ten minutes.] [-Walid!] [-Okay, I'll see what I can do.] [Walid.] [Call the Sheikh.] [How will I talk to him?] [Call his cell phone, we'll speak with the Jews who caught him.] [We'll negotiate with them, no Egyptians or Germans needed,] [quickly, with no mediators.] [-Call him up, what can we lose?] [-Alright.] [Here's a voice changer.] [Use it like I told you, okay?] [I think you should let Shirin check him.] [Why?] [You saw him, he's all swollen and boiling with fever.] [We can't lose him. We might need more time than we planned.] [-No, we don't.] [-We do.] [Listen to me for once.] [Alright. Have her check him up.] [For God's sake, is that what's on your mind now?] [Call.] Doron, it's the Sheikh's cell phone. [Hello?] [Hello, who's this?] [Sheikh Awdallah's disciple. With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?] [I'm also the Sheikh's disciple,] [and I want him back along with another 1,500 prisoners.] [-I'll speak only with Abu Ahmad.] [-Abu Ahmad has died a Shahid.] [The Sheikh already told me that Abu Ahmad is alive,] [and if you don't let me talk to him,] [your Sheikh will be the first to fuck 72 virgins.] [Since when does the State of Israel kill prisoners?] [I'm not the State of Israel.] [Who are you then?] [I'm the one who will kill the Sheikh if you don't return our guy.] [How can we be sure you've got the Sheikh?] [Talk to him, he's listening.] [Don't give in to them! Don't surrender!] [Now, put my friend on the phone.] [Your friend isn't here.] [Okay, we're done playing games. I want a prisoner swap within 24 hours.] [We're okay with the swap and with the timeframe,] [but we've got a list of other prisoners as well.] [You're not listening to me. I have no other prisoners but the Sheikh.] [If you want him in exchange for our guy, that's great.] [If not, then we're done talking.] [We'll send a prisoner list to your drop box.] [You're not listening, I have no prisoners!] [No prisoners, no swap.] [And since you say you're nobody,] [we want a government minister of yours] [present when you return our prisoners.] [I don't know what's going on here.] [It's nothing. It must be Gideon Avital, the smartass,] [with his usual lies and antics. He thinks he won't pay a heavy toll,] [but I'll make the fucker pay through the nose.] -It's all on the computer, it's better. -I like it this way. -Can I help? -Do you know where Doron is? I already told you, I don't. -Think, where would he take the Sheikh? -Beats me. How could your entire team pull a stunt like this without you knowing? Are you accusing me of something? Why did Doron ask everyone but you to join him? Because he knew I'd never agree to it, okay? This is mutiny, and if I ever find out you knew about this, I will fuck you over. Big time. [No, no...!] [Relax, relax.] [When did you last give him the antibiotics?] [About four hours ago, or something.] [What is this? The bottle should be half full and it's empty.] [You'll feel better soon.] [You'll feel better soon.] [-Please...] [-Shhhh...] [Don't be scared, everything's alright.] [Thank you.] [I'm sorry.] [Stay here.] [I'm sorry.] [Don't go, don't go.] [Don't go.] [Shirin.] [-Shirin.] [-What?] [How much longer does he have?] [Given that he's here in his current state and not in a hospital, ten hours,] [maybe less. We must return him to them.] [Alright, I'll see him when I get back from Abu Ahmad.] Something's up. All I see is an old lady watering her plants. It's okay. What's your real name? -Steve. -Tell me the truth. Herzl. Herzl? Yes, Herzl. Nurit, I hope we're not wasting our time while God knows what they're doing to Boaz. I hope they're treating him like we're treating the Sheikh. Nurit, what's with you? It was the only way to get that fucker to talk. Trust Doron, he's got no regrets... Whoa, are you okay? Is this because of Boaz? Don't worry, Nurit, we'll get him back. By hook or by crook. Everything alright? There there... Sorry. -Anything new? -Nothing. They're not carrying phones, and we haven't tracked any incoming calls to relatives in Ramallah or Nablus. -E-mails? -Nothing was sent in the last 24 hours. They're smarter than that. Gideon says Doron is under a ton of pressure, it's the perfect time to screw up. Who's that? Okay, let her in. Gali, we're doing everything we can to bring him back ASAP. We've joined with the IDF, the Secret Service, the Mossad, and Gideon Avital is in contact with foreign Intelligence bodies. We'll get him back. If Boaz dies, it'll be on your conscience. Gali, come here. You'll get him back. Come, Gali. Not now, bro. Everything will be okay. -Want some water? -Yes. Tell me the truth. As far as we know, Doron took part of the team to go find Boaz with no authorization nor backup. Just picked up and left. -Have you heard from him? -Nothing. He ended contact. Why didn't you join them? It all happened so fast, at the time I didn't think it was a good idea. You know I'll do anything to bring Boaz back. How much can you do from here? Do you really think what he did was normal? I told him to do it. [Walid.] [How's the prisoner list coming along?] [It isn't. I told you, I've got no prisoners.] [Okay. Perhaps talking with your friend will change your mind.] [Talk.] -Doron. -Boaz. Don't worry, we're coming to rescue you. They opened me up, Doron, they took my kidney. What?! -Doron... -Boaz! Get me out of here. -Get me out of here, Doron! -Boaz! Boaz! [Walid!] [Walid!] [What did you do to him?!] [Nothing yet. This was nothing.] [What about the list?] [Listen to me.] [I'll rip the Sheikh's eyes and heart out with my bare hands] [if you don't return my friend alive and well.] [One more thing:] [Gone are the days when we freed 1,000 prisoners in exchange for one.] [Forget it! It's the Sheikh in exchange for your prisoner!] [Listen, you son of a bitch.] [There's no way I'd agree to such a swap.] [I'd rather have the Sheikh die as a Shahid, understood?] [I'll send you a list of 50 prisoners] [and I want Gideon Avital present during the swap] [so that things are taken seriously, understood?] [He'll be there. But listen to me, Walid Al-Abed, you bastard,] [if anything happens to my friend,] [I will personally come and kill you.] [I will slaughter your entire family and drink your blood!] MASYOUN NEIGHBORHOOD RAMALLAH [-What are you doing here?] [-Hello.] [-How did you get here?] [-Can I come in?] [Please do.] [I need to tell you something.] [I'm from the Palestine Preventive Security.] [I couldn't tell you that before.] [I shouldn't have told you that now either,] [but I wanted to level with you.] [To level with me? After lying this whole time?] [Look, a Fauda (riot) is about to break out, and I want to protect you.] [But you'll have to tell me what you've done.] [What did I do? What do you want from me?] [We know that the people who kidnapped the Jew took out his kidney.] [I want to know if you had anything to do with it.] [I don't know what you're talking about.] [If the Jew dies, we're all doomed.] [The Jews will attack us.] [Nothing will stop them.] [Many women and children will die,] [so unless you want them ending up in your E.R., tell me the truth.] [It's not what you think.] [They asked me to operate on him, but I didn't take out his kidney.] [They gave me something to put inside his abdomen.] [You don't understand, they were holding my mother ransom] [and threatened to kill her if I don't do the implant.] [-What did you implant?] [-Something this big,] [could be electronic,] [perhaps a computer.] What happened, bro? What is it? They put something inside Boaz's abdomen. -What?! -Who told you that? The doctor who did it. She doesn't know what it is. -Perhaps a tracking device? -Why would they do that? Give me a cigarette. It could be a... This is gonna sound crazy, but hear me out. In 2009, Al-Qaeda tried to assassinate the Saudi prince Mohammed Bin Naif using a suicide bomber with an explosive charge in his abdomen. But that was Al-Qaeda. Could Abu Ahmad do something like that? That's exactly it. He wants to carry out a terrorist attack during the swap. -They also want Gideon Avital there. -He wants Gideon Avital wiped out. Not that I care about the fucker, but they're planning an attack, ISIS style. I'll slaughter that motherfucker. We're executing Plan B. Steve, Nurit, go. For fuck's sake! [It's not his fault.] [The Israelis are after him, what could he do?] [Enough. I've sacrificed enough, let someone else do it.] [You don't need to tell me about sacrifice.] [I'm sorry. But I don't want us to lose Abu Ahmad as well.] [The kids are growing up thinking their father is dead.] [I hate it. I want them to have a proper father] [whom they can respect and be with.] [Enough. Wake the kids up, it's late.] [Are we moving again?] [Just for a few days, sweetie.] [-Where's Abura?] [-She's probably at Zrizi's.] [Abir.] [Abir.] [Abir.] [Abir!] [The successful attack was a real blow to the enemy,] [and was just one of the many surprises planned...] [I thought you forgot about us.] [We're willing to swap the Sheikh plus 50 prisoners, for Boaz.] [If this doesn't happen in the next two hours,] [I'm setting the Sheikh on fire.] [The swap will take place in Wadi Zaitoon.] [Alright, I know where that is.] [I want this to go down nice and quiet. No Fauda.] [Heaven help you if you put up any snipers.] [I want the area clear for a radius of 1 km.] [No problem.] [Which government official are you sending?] [The most important one - our Defense Minister.] [Listen to me, you son of a bitch.] [I know you put a bomb inside your prisoner.] [If you detonate it, we blow up the Sheikh.] [Who knows about the bomb?] [-Two people.] [-Who?] [-Bassam and Shirin.] [-And you. That's three.] [-Me?!] [-Then how did it leak out?] [-You think I told them?!] [-I don't know what to think.] [One of your people works for the Jews.] [-Can't be!] [-Well, it is!] [-Perhaps it was your cousin Shirin.] [-Or you.] [Walid! Shut up, or I swear to God...] [I'm sick of this! We should've given him to Abu Samara!] [He should've taken care of it.] WADI ZAITOON WEST OF RAMALLAH [Looks clear.] [No soldiers or cars.] [Hold on.] [There's a car approaching.] [Do you see the Sheikh?] [Walid, what's going on?] [The Sheikh is facing us. Our prisoner is out of the car.] [Is Gideon Avital there?] [Walid?] [Talk to me!] [Walid.] [Abir is here.] [Abir is here.] [Two armed men have Abir and the Sheikh wearing explosive belts.] [-What?!] [-Abu Ahmad, what do we do?] [If you detonate Boaz, I blow Abir up.] [I repeat: If you detonate Boaz, I blow Abir up!] [What do we do?] Boaz, don't worry, we're coming to get you. [Abu Ahmad, what do we do?] [-How far are you from Abir?] [-Pretty close, I guess.] [-How far?] [-I don't know exactly, Abu Ahmad.] [50 meters away? 20? 100? 1,000?] [Less, around 30 meters.] [Think not of those who are slain in Allah's way as dead.] [Nay, they live, finding sustenance in the presence of their Lord.] [Let him go, Walid.] [Let him go.] Come here, Boaz. Walk towards me. A bit more, keep walking. [Tell me what to do.] [Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!] [-Press it.] [-What?!] Walk towards me, Boaz, don't worry. [Press it! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!]
