 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES RIO'S BAR Okay, JR was as high as a kite, but perhaps that means he was telling the truth, and Titan does live in this damn building. He has to live somewhere and I doubt there are many bat caves around here. Wait. This storm might work in our favor. Everyone will be at home, so we can go door to door and ask them questions. Cool.

 -Holy crap! -What the...? What the hell? Man! What the hell happened to this bike? I'm hungry. Shall we grab a bite? I can't believe Lola is with that Will Smith lookalike. With Rober, I mean. If you take away his personality, his charm, his toned legs, his sexy brown skin, what's left? What's left? You're supposed to say, "Sounds like you!" Don't you know the joke? Listen, "Guardian of the Galaxy, superhero and all-round great guy." Sound good? I think it's good. It's for my Twitter bio.

 Why isn't Titan a trending topic? José Ramón's interview has 10,000 likes. Do you like that? Is it tasty? It's full of fiber. What are you looking at? What? Don't even think about it! Don't poop, dog! I'm taking you outside before you mess up the place. -Hi! -Hi. -How's it going? -Good. -How are you? -Well... -I'm feeling better. -Yeah? -Yeah. -I'm glad. That's good. -José? -Yes. Well... I was thinking that since you came to Madrid, you moved in with a stranger, almost fell off a roof, met a superhero, been high on TV, and yesterday you told me you've barely been studying. Well, I was exaggerating a bit. -Really? -Yeah, really. -And why don't you go now? -What are you cooking? Paparajotes. -Yum! -Yeah. You're so great! Be careful! José Ramón! You've just won big mouth of the year! See you on the roof in five minutes so I can congratulate you. Get up there. Honey... Do you mind if I pop upstairs to see Javi? I think he's got a problem with wheelie-dog. Okay, I'm going to take a shower. I wanted to see Madrid, but with this weather... -Yeah. -Good. -Sure, go. -See you! Wait a second! Why don't you take some paparajotes for Javi too? -Sure. -Why not? -Okay, good. -Okay. -See you in a bit. -See you! -Good. -Bye. -Well... -Julia isn't home. No, I know. We're here to see you. Actually, I was just on my way to run an errand. Just a quick question. Why did you say that Titan... lives in this building? I was really high last night. -I don't remember-- -But something so specific. To say that he lives in the same building as you, must have come from somewhere, right? Of course. Well, when I was hanging from the roof, I thought I saw something coming out of the... from the interior patio. The interior patio? I think it was him, or perhaps it was someone visiting, or perhaps it was the doorman. There is no doorman here. See? Pay me no attention! Anyway, we wanted to question all the neighbors, see what we can find out, and... Can we use your apartment as a base camp to get our ideas in order? No problem for me. The thing is Alicia's here. My girlfriend Alicia. She's visiting. We need some privacy, if you know what I mean. To... -Well, to-- -You're going to fuck, you mean? Yes, exactly. Anyway, I should get back to her. Oh, okay. We'll call you, if... We'll talk later, okay? Okay. Bye! My house is your house. You know it. -Thanks. -Don't mention it. I'll get something to eat, some donuts or some... Surprise us! We have to start ruling people out. -It's a guy, so the girls are out. -Why? Why are the girls out? Why can't it be a woman? I guess because of the physique, the voice... Yeah, but we don't know anything for sure. It could be some kind of shell or suit, that's changing the voice, right? I'm just saying, let's not jump to any hasty conclusions. Okay. Donuts! Titan's on social networks. Twitter, so I don't miss any emergencies, and Instagram so people can see just how damn awesome I am! This storm couldn't have come at a better time. I mean, a flood washes away a caravan, there's Titan. A tree is about to fall on an old lady, there's Titan. A lightning bolt strikes in La Castellana... I might not make it, but I'll try. That's great, but for now you should stay at home. Why? Because Lola and Rober are here asking questions. Oh, Lola and Rober. Sure, the hot couple, Lola and Rober. Lola and Rober, falling in love... Who cares about them? I don't care! Do you care? I care about you getting caught. Be careful. And clean up that little present your dog left. Damn! -Let's go, man. -No. Am I saving the world or scooping poop? I can't do both. This looks like a person did it! J. I thought you were Alicia. She's in the shower, so tell me quick. How was your reunion? Was she really mad about you being on TV? No. Alicia's an angel. If she's not angry, how come I didn't hear any noises last night? Not even some foreplay? You're from a small town, but you're still millennials, J. -Julia, that's private. -Oh, okay. I thought we were friends, that's all. But I see I was wrong. Look... Let's just say... in that area, we're having some... problems. It's like we don't... fit. What do you mean you don't fit? I don't know, we don't fit! It's all become a bit boring... repetitive, few and far between. Okay, look me in the eye, J. I'm going to ask you something extremely important, okay? Do you go down on your girlfriend? Well, I mean that's not exactly a yes or no question... Actually, yes it is! Do you go down on her or not? Oh, for crying out loud! For God sake, J! I tried to at the start, but she got embarrassed. Then I got embarrassed too. Oh, man! Did you know that for every cunnilingus, men get 100,000 blow jobs? It's true, and it's your responsibility to change that. You know what? You're going to do it today! Yes! I'm going to go before Alicia gets back... fresh from the shower. Go get her! The water shut off. -Really? -Yes. But you had time to...? Yeah, of course. Listen, honey. I... I was thinking... -Yes? -If you fancy it. -Tell me. -That we could... -That perhaps we could-- -What? Make some more paparajotes. Oh, sure! Oh, hi. Marcelo, what are we? What? What do you mean what? The Karma Police. We're the fucking Karma Police. We need some kind of mission or something. I'd do something with my friends, but would we reward them or punish them? I may have something. It's a penis. It's a big penis. It appeared four days ago. I erased it and it reappeared. The same thing's been happening all week. Perhaps Banksy lives in the building and we're ruining his show! This morning I saw the guy from apartment 2A with a huge marker. I didn't dare to say anything. This is perfect! Our first mission! -How shall we punish him? -Keep your voice down. And we don't punish people, we... How did you put it? Oh yes. We restore the karmic balance. Yeah, restore the karmic balance, that's exactly it. I don't think anyone lives here. We can carry on with... -Hey, what's up? -Hey! Hey! I'll start downstairs. Okay. So, I'll... -See you! -Okay. I met your little friend yesterday. I didn't know you liked dogs. Yeah, I like dogs. I've always liked them, but now I like them even more. I'm not the Javier you used to know. I've changed. I've matured. I mean, look at him. He's a dog with wheels. The best of dog and machine, all in one. Look... -Like Ben-Hur without the Romans. -He's so cute! You're in good company too, right? With him? Yeah, but... he's just a work colleague. Hey, no need to explain. I don't care what you're up to. Oh, you don't care, which means... No, I mean... you can do what you like. -And so can I. -Sure. -Of course, you can! -Of course, I can. But he's just your colleague, right? -I thought you didn't care. -No, I don't. It's just because I see you together here, at the bar, everywhere. Because we're investigating the Titan story. What JR said about him living in the building. Yeah. Yeah. Right. You know what José Ramón's like normally. Imagine what he's like when he's high. -Right. -Don't pay him any attention. -Yeah. -No. Listen... What do you think of Titan? Well, I think he's awesome. -Really? -Sure, he's a superhero! It's the story of the century! Imagine what a superhero could do. What could he do? -I don't know. -No, I don't know. I don't know either, but perhaps a superhero could... perhaps he could change things, be a role model. -A role model? -Yeah. And if I manage to get an interview with him, well... I'll go down in history at the magazine and that would be cool! Good afternoon! Do you mind answering some quick questions? -It's about-- -No. Hello! How are you? So, we're... Have you told him already? Okay. On Monday night, you were... Monday night? -Honestly, I'm not home much. -Monday afternoon-- I don't know what happened, but it's probably his fault. Coming here to steal from the hardworking Spanish. I work on a boat rescuing immigrants in the Mediterranean. Wow! Monday night. On Monday at eight o'clock I was at home minding my own business. No, I mean that's really cool. Oh, what's wrong? And he knocked my car right into the crash barrier. I have to go throw up. I've got a really bad stomach bug. Good luck! Okay. So, the only person left is... Javi. Emergency. A person falling. How do I search for this? You could have given me a manual along with the suit, you know? Breaking news from Madrid's Puerta del Sol. The high winds have damaged the iconic Tío Pepe sign, which could fall at any moment. Listen. Despite warnings, bystanders are filming the scene on their phones, while police have cordoned off the area... No way! What do you say? Titan to the rescue, am I right? This city needs me, buddy. Don't eat anything, what you crapped this morning was from another planet! Shit, water! Damn it! Disgusting. -What's up? -How are you? -I'm just on my way out. -It'll just take a minute. I've been at it all day and I'd like to get it over and done with. I see some things never change, eh, Javier? They're not mine. -Are they the dog's? -Yeah... If I knew you were coming, I would've cleaned up. -It was a joke! -I swear, I've changed. I wasn't born yesterday! Look, I was on my way out-- Sorry, we'll be really quick. I wanted to ask... We're trying to find out about Titan. -Remember I told you? -Hi, Javi! -Hi. -Hi. -This is Alicia, my girlfriend. -You're just like on the mug! -Nice to meet you. -Same here. I brought you more paparajotes, in case you've run out. Doggy, look at this. -Paparajotes! Come in. -Yes. -Where shall I put them? -Next to the TV. -Hi. -I think they suspect me. I have to get to the Tío Pepe sign. Distract them. Don't even think about it! -Javier, are you going to answer me, or... -Sure. Rober, try the paparajotes. They're amazing! They're yummy! It's my grandma's recipe. Try them! -Let's go. -No, thank you. -They're really delicious. -Right... -Javier, can we get started? -Yes. The Tío Pepe sign, emblem of the city, could fall at any moment. We'll continue our live updates... Oh, José, I wanted to take a photo there. -Yeah, but now-- -Listen. The paparajotes are so good, I must've eaten 25 of them! And I forgot to not eat the leaf. And now I'm a bit... Excuse me a second, I have to-- Where are you going? -The bathroom. -Why? I mean, we are all here. You have to go now? Is it urgent? -I don't want to go into detail. -No, we don't care about the details. Javier. Right. TIO PEPE ANDALUSIAN SUN IN A BOTTLE We'll fight art with art. Wait, what are you going to draw? A penis, right? You can't punish someone who draws a penis with a penis! He obviously likes them. We want to punish him, not decorate his front door. -Right. -Besides, why is it always penises? Why doesn't anyone draw pussies? Let's draw a pussy. -Okay, fine. -Go on. You don't know how to draw a pussy, do you? I have no idea. It's not that hard! Excuse me, can you tell me why you're painting... a wigwam on my door? A pussy! It's a pussy! Has no one ever seen a pussy? You obviously don't like going down on them. -What's going on? -We're painting... a pussy. Is pussy hard to say? What about vagina? Does vagina suit men better or what? Why are you painting a pussy? Because you draw penises on the landing, man. Are you denying it? Nothing to say? I shouldn't have done it. You do it all the time! That penis... my son drew that penis last Monday. That same day we had an accident and now he's in a coma. That penis is the last thing he drew. I know it's crazy, but... I want to see that penis every day. Okay, we'll erase the pussy. José, your friend's taking a while. Is he okay? Javier doesn't usually take this long. You know what? Last night I had a dream. Last night I dreamed... that I passed my exams and you were all there to celebrate with me. You were there, my family, Julia was there too, and of course, my love, you were there too, and Lola as well. Eh, Lola? And then we all decided to hire Nacho Cano, with the band Mecano, obviously, and he said to me, "José Ramón, you play the keyboard. Play it," and so I did. Javier, are you okay? Maybe he's feeling sick. He's fine. So, Lola... Nacho Cano was there, but he only had one arm. So Nacho Cano says, "You play it," because he couldn't with his stump. So I said, "Okay, I'll play it." Breaking news from the center of Madrid, specifically from the Puerta del Sol. It's been confirmed that Titan, the mysterious masked man some are calling a superhero, has stopped the Tío Pepe sign from falling off the roof of the building. Get your phone. Yesterday, he saved you, and now the Tío Pepe sign. It might not be the same. There can't be two superheroes in the same city. -Just one is incredible enough. -This is Madrid, honey! Javier! Yeah, he's been in there over half an hour. Javi, you okay? He says he's okay. He said no such thing! Out of the way! Javier, open up! He ate a lot of paparajotes. A lot! What if he's allergic? What if he can't breathe? Maybe I killed him! Out the way! -What are you doing? -Sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry. I think things are getting a bit out of hand. I didn't think I'd end the day seeing my boyfriend take a dump! Ex-boyfriend. -He was taking a dump, right? -What do you mean? He was sitting there, but... if he was Titan, then maybe... he could've flown there and back and had time to sit down. Yeah. Water. -Water! There's no water. -No water? The water's cut off to whole building. If Javier was crapping all that time, the bathroom should be a war zone. Javier, open up! -What is it? -I forgot something. -I'm coming! One second. -Open up! -What's up? Hi. -Hi. What's up? -Where are you going? -One second... No, not in there! My God, Javier! You're rotten inside! I warned you there was a dead paparajote in there! Okay, maybe I'm getting a bit obsessed with this Titan thing and I'm losing it. Sorry. -What? -You really thought it was me? Don't get carried away. That I flew off to save the sign and then flew back? Really? You were last on my list! -Don't forget it. -But you thought it, didn't you? -I'm going. -Look at me fly. I'm leaving. The electricity is back. Marcelo, the club's closing, where's the after-party? J. Teamwork. You crap it out, I throw it away. We make a great team. I'm exhausted. I think I've got jet lag. José, what are you doing? The Karma Police's first day was a failure. Oh, José! You're wrong. The Karma Police rocked today. We rocked! So, we're back to square one. But we've ruled out 15 suspects. Just 46 million left. Not many, then. Well, it's not all bad news. I've got a new follower on Instagram. TITAN Holy shit! Subtitle translation by Leon Elalouf
