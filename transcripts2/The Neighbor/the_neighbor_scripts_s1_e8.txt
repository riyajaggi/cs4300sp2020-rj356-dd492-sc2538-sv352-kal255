 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES "If there's one thing Titan is good for, it's to give humanity a lesson in humility. A superhero who represents us and is just like us. He's not just lost, he's super lost." Written by Lola Carrero. What? Sorry, man. There's a really funny GIF here. Okay... She says he's lost, just like the rest of humanity. So, it's not great, but it's not terrible either.

 Titan needs to do good deeds... But what? Lola hates Titan, but she doesn't hate me, Javier. She was pretty impressed I adopted a lame dog. I have to get Wheelie-Dog back. Wheelie-Dog is doing great. His new owner is awesome. What are you going to do? Steal him? No. No way! -Javi! -What? -Don't even think about it! -I'm not a thief. -Hi. -Hi, sweetie. How are you? Hi. Come in. -Hello, my love. -Hi.

 Hi, baby. Your exam's getting close and I don't want you to feel alone. Even though you're the one taking the exam, it's going to change our futures. So, I hired a tutor to give you a surprise mock exam! Hi, José Ramón. Alicia told me how hard you've been working. We'll do a multiple choice exam, very simple and quick, to see what your current level is. Then we'll have a look at each topic and the oral exam. You're going to do great, baby. I just know it. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Almost a million likes! It's in the top five most shared articles and it looks set to become number one. -Unbelievable. -You're killing it, Lolita. -Thanks. -No, thank you. So, tell me, what do you want to do next? You've got free rein. -There's one topic I'd like to talk about. -Yes? I want to do a report on all the bookies opening up. It's something no one else is talking about and it's a plague. These places are black holes, where people destroy their lives and drink cheap beer. I completely understand. Right? I don't know why no one's talking about it. It feels like an invasion. Yeah, but TV, magazines, papers, they all make their money from ads. These bookies spend a fortune on ads. No one says anything because they're cowards. -Disgusting! -Yeah. -Okay, so I'll get started on it. -No, you won't. You're not going to do it, Lola, for two reasons: one, because those bookies also advertise through us. In fact, their banners are on your Titan interview. And two, because I'm a bit of a coward, too. But you just said I had free rein. Lolita, you're so cute! I'm giving you free rein on anything to do with Titan. Lola, Titan is your topic. Okay? I'm glad we cleared things up. Ciao, guys! I was hoping for a bit of support. I see Marta's point. This isn't a charity and I don't want to get fired. -Hi, Javi. -Hi. -I'll have a tea, please. -Coming right up. Is that food for your imaginary dog? -This is real food for my real dog. -Damn it. I swear I was telling you the truth about that. Why don't you go pick up its imaginary poo? Or better yet, step in it! Perhaps it'll give you imaginary good luck. -Are you talking about Wheelie-Dog? -Yes. -Who's Wheelie-Dog? -Javier's dog. He doesn't have a dog. Sure he does! It's super cute. And this dog, is it lame? Lame? I don't like that word. Nor disabled, nor handicapped. Wheelie-Dog has special needs. Is that true? Yeah. I was surprised too, to be honest. -Javi? -Yeah... I'm sorry, man. This is like Peter and the Wolf. Just like Peter and the Wolf. -Who's Peter? -Come here. You can come back to work whenever you want. Really? -How could I have not trusted you? -Well... And I can lend you the money for the dog's operation. How much is it? -Two-- Three thousand euros. -Damn. -That's going to blow my budget. -No, wait. With the wheelchair it's 4,000. No. Who knows when I could pay you back. Perhaps in a year, or perhaps never. Javi, listen. That's the least of my worries. The main thing is for you to bring Wheelie-Dog here. I feel awful for not believing you. Okay. No-- He's got post-traumatic stress. I can't bring him into such a confined space. -He won't like it. -Go on! Bring him! Okay. -Hey, how's it going? -What's up? -Lola. -What? Did you know Javier has a dog? Yeah, he's a real cutie-pie. Speaking of which, if sometime you feel like... taking him out for a walk or something, let me know. Oh, yeah, sure! I'd really love that. Okay. -Ciao. -Ciao. José Ramón, I need the number of the woman who adopted the dog. Take the dog for a walk, eh? Of course. Get me a beer. I had a Red Bull this morning. It must have affected me. But don't worry... I won't have any coffee the day of the exam. Just herbal tea. Not even any sugar. Well, thanks so much for coming. Really. It was great to meet you. -Same here. -Bye. Thank you. You told me you hadn't stopped studying since you arrived in Madrid. Yes. You lied to me. Look, José, remember what we said about talking about our feelings? I don't want you to lie to me again. The thing is... I've found it hard to concentrate here in Madrid. But I promise that's all going to change. No more lies, José! No more. We're going to set up your desk so it's easier to concentrate, and when I say we, I mean me! I swear, I couldn't believe it. Rober was suddenly this whole other person. Fucking money. People can't get enough. People like money because they like drinking beer. That's two bucks, for example. I'm not charging you! I'm just giving you an example. Hey, listen... You can't give free drinks to everyone. I know, Adolfo. Just Lola. And hot guys! Go on, go. I'll take care of everything. Right. So... So, this is a mission for the Karma Police. -Exactly. -We need more than eggplants this time. We have to crank it up a notch. Yeah, I've actually already come up with a plan. Andoni has to come back to finish the Sportere ad. So let's go and convince him to record a video about all the damage the bookies are doing. Okay, I like it. How will we convince him? I don't have that part of the plan yet. So... Hey, you! What's up? Come here. Look at you... Wow! Who's got the fastest wheels in the park? Hello. -He really loves you. -And I love him. That's why I called. It was all a mistake. So I'm going to have to take Wheelie-Dog back. I'm his real owner. I don't like the word owner. It implies he's your property. I like to use a more human term. I totally agree. Look, I know you were told you could keep him. I mean adopt him, because he's not a thing, he's a sentient being. But the guy with the beard who gave him to you is mad. He made a mistake. You've no idea how important he is to me. I need Wheelie-Dog. I don't like that name either. Seriously? Wheelie-Dog's cool. But I don't think his name should come from his injury. I call him Dragon because if he can't run, he can fly. But... he can't fly. Yes, he can. How? He can fly in a plane. Does he spit fire? His name's Dragon. If you give him back, I'll call him whatever you like. First you want me to adopt him, now you want him back. I'm not saying you and your friend are bad people, but it's not a good environment for Dragon. I'd say the leash is a bit owner-like. I mean... This week, experience the game like no one else. Live it, play it, win it! Cut! That slogan sucks! That's a wrap, guys! "Live it." What does that even mean? It's a shitty slogan. Mine is much better. I'm a bit nervous. Don't be nervous, we got this. -Yeah. -Okay? Call me a taxi. I need you to be a bit... raunchy. -I don't know how to be raunchy. -Sure you do! -Okay, I'm going. -Okay! Excuse me, Andoni, hi! How are you? -Hi. -This is really embarrassing but... would you mind taking a photo with me? Yes. I mean, no. -So then... -Sure, a photo's no problem. Could we take it on your cell? Mine takes the worst photos. Then you can send it to me and that way you'll have my number. Sure. Smile! Shall I give it to you? My number, I mean. Here you go. What the-- That's the crazy girl from the bar! Where's she going with my cell phone? -What the hell is going on? -Chill out, Andoni. It's okay. We're pacifists. We just want to talk to you, calmly, that's all. Apart from being a barmaid, my friend's also a hacker, okay? So if you don't do it, she'll hack your phone and publish the grossest thing in there, and I'm sure there's a lot. There's nothing, you crazy bitch. Do what you like with my cell. I'll buy another one. So screw you both! -Your choice. -What? Oh, no. No, wait! Give me back my cell right now! Give it back! In one minute you're going to have the perfect space to study. Honey, let me help. No. You don't believe in energy. Babe, it's not that I don't believe in it, it's just that... Well, I... We've seen how your method works, now let's try mine. Look, it's about being rational. If science hasn't discovered chakras, perhaps it's because they don't exist. You start out with feng shui and Marie Kondo, and end up trying to cure cancer with homeopathy. And believing, I don't know, that Pachamama can correct your eyesight. I'm going out for a moment. -Okay. -Okay? -Sure. -Okay then... This is awesome! Look at all this! -Really. -Awesome. Awesome chakras and cleanliness! I'm going... Okay? Yeah, okay. -Hello. -Are you Lucy? No, I'm Alicia. José Ramón's girlfriend. That jerk José. He messed me up with the room. Yes, you already told me. I wanted to ask you something. Do you sell... drugs? Me? No. Oh, really? What do you want? No, nothing. I just wanted to ask you a question. Is this... a drug? -Let me see. -No, wait-- Give it here, damn it! No, I don't recognize it, but with all the new shit coming from the Ukraine, it's hard to keep up to date, you know? -Can I? -No! Just a lick. Okay. -Is it a drug? -I don't know, these things-- How much you want for it? No, I'm not selling it. -Bye. -It came from the Ukraine, right? No. I can't do that. Fine, then get ready for everything in here to go public. I've already seen you like to send a lot of dick pics. Just like that. "Hi, I'm Andoni and this is my dick." No, you can't do that. Don't you get it? I can't bad-mouth bookies. I've signed a contract. They'd crucify me. Who's this guy, anyway? -I'm Marcelo. -Marcelo, there's no need. We're the Karma Police. The Karma Police? Okay. I can see where this is going. But I'm afraid I'm not going to make that video. People are old enough to know what they're doing. People's lives get ruined. They can't pay their mortgages. That's just the way it goes. Perhaps they've been bad and deserve it. No, wait! Perhaps it's karma. Those people haven't done anything bad, okay, you asshole? Sure they have. Spending the money for their mortgage. -This wine's corked. -I'll be right back. Keep him here. He's staying right here, don't you worry. I swear on my pussy! Sweetie, this is amazing. Now all I want to do is study! -Must be the energy-- -Can you tell me what this is? That's nothing. Are you taking drugs to study? Or is it for going out partying? Do you go out partying? No, it's nothing like that. No, José, I don't want to hear any more lies. Here's what we're going to do. I'm going to the park, because I still haven't been, and you're going to stay here and think about whether it's worth messing up what we have for a pill. But it's... Shit. Come here. Let's get out of here. What? You want to stay? She's very responsible. She'll feed you well, that's for sure. But will you be happy? Listen. Smell lots of butts, okay? You deserve it. Okay? I'm going to miss you. Thank god, I thought he'd run off. I turned away for a second. He saw me and ran over. He came flying over, like a dragon. Anyway, bye, doggy. -See you. -See you. I won't film any videos and if you publish anything, I'll sue you all. -Like hell you will! -We're here! This is Don Ramón, my old math teacher. Hi, I'm Marcelo. Wow! Public education's really gone downhill. Don Ramón, can you tell our friend what happened to you? Sure. I started young, playing bingo at the weekends. Let's just say that Ramón got over his gambling problem, right? And when he'd got his family, his home and his job back, well... -That's when... -That's when it started. Play, play, play. Bet, bet, bet. All day, every day. Everywhere. It was only time before I relapsed. The worst thing is that my nephew got hooked along with me. -See the problem, Marcelo? -I mean, how could he not get hooked? Kids leave school and only have to cross the street to bet on any old match. It's become normal for kids to waste their money betting on any old thing. It's just awful. Andoni, please. Can you really not see it? Okay, I'm sorry. I never thought about it like that. So? Screw it! I'll do the video. Oh, great! Thank you so much. -Quickly, before I change my mind. -Hand me the cell. -Come on. -Okay. -Ready? -Yes, it's great. -Thank you. -Okay. Recording. Hi. For many years, I've starred in advertisements for bookies. I thought it was just a game. Until today, when I met Don Ramón. Don Ramón. Don Ramón is a math teacher-- I'll take that, since you have-- Listen... I... It was nice to see you again. Shit! Holy shit! Javi, I've been waiting for you. I need your help, man. What are you doing with Wheelie-Dog? I spoke to the owner and made her see how much I need him. -We're on our way to meet Adolfo. -Alicia found a pill. -What kind of pill? -You know. From... What's that? Shit, you mean-- Wait, is that meant to be Titan? You'd make a shit superhero! Where'd she find it? You must have dropped it coming through the window. -Don't you clean after I come over? -I don't have time, thanks to you! Some help you are! -I have to tell Alicia. -What? No, you can't! No one can know Titan's secret, for God's sake! I can't believe I have to tell you this. What's wrong with you? Javi, it's great you're this responsible guy now, but my relationship's at stake. What about mine? If Lola finds out I'm Titan, I'm screwed. So keeping Titan a secret is all for Lola? No, Lola and everyone else. Don't be so fussy. A wise man once said, "If there can be a superhero, there should be a superhero." It's up to you to keep it that way. Remember? What am I going to do, man? I don't know if I'm helping. Oh, look! But... What the hell did you do? Are you crazy or what? I freaked out, okay? I swear, I'm against violence. -Help! -Shut up! -Help! -Shut up! Hey! Okay! It was an accident, okay? Just an accident, so let's all calm down. We'll find something for that wound and then have a calm chat about what's going on. -Okay. -Okay? -Yes. -Okay. Lola, come help me find some antiseptic or something. -Marcelo, stay with him. -I'm sorry! Careful! I said careful! Goddammit! Careful! Careful! Look at how fast you are! Seriously? Since I left, this place has gone down the toilet. -Let's go. -Help! Help! CLOSED Okay. Help! Don't worry. You're safe now. Right. I'm Titan. Titan? -What are you doing? -Lola? -Why are you helping that asshole? -Marcelo! You're all crazy! Marcelo, are you okay? -Where'd he go? -My new suit! You jerk! Did you do this to him? He's an old man! What's your problem? Why would you attack him? -Marcelo? -I'm sorry. "I'm sorry." For God's sake! Come here. It's okay, you're going to be fine. You'll be as good as new in no time. I... Javi? -What are you doing here? -What are you doing here? I'm just... What happened? Look... What happened? That jerk Titan, that's what happened. Hi. Hello. How was the park? José... Ali, that pill... It's nothing bad, I swear. -It's not a drug. -Okay. But it's really important for me that you know... that I can't tell you. I promised not to. Okay. Then... good luck with your exams. Man, that was really scary. I'll bring him breakfast tomorrow and he'll be back on his feet in no time. Anyway... I'm going to head off. Oh, okay. We'll talk tomorrow? We'll talk tomorrow. -Sleep well! -Same to you two. So, then... I'm going. Yeah, I have to go too. Wheelie-Dog hasn't had dinner. Sure. Poor thing. Listen, I'm sorry about all that stuff with Titan. Don't be sorry, it's not your fault. We got an asshole for a superhero, that's all. These things happen.
