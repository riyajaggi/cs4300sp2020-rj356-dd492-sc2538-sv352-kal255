 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES HI, JOURNALIST. CAN WE TALK? JUST THE TWO OF US. ANSWER AND I'LL TELL YOU WHERE AND WHEN. What is it? It's... It's a message from Titan. He wants me to interview him. That's fucking awesome! We're gonna make history! Yes. Well, actually...

 he wants me to go alone to interview him. Good morning! Good morning indeed! How was last night? Well, good. Really good. I know! I heard you from my room. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make so much noise. If you don't make noise when someone's going down on you they're not doing it right! He went down on you, right? You don't mind me asking, do you? No, it doesn't bother me. And, yes, the answer is... yes. -And how was it? -Well...

 really good, although... Well, I guess it's just... You're not going to believe this, but... it was my first time. Yeah, I believe it. -Ali, how long have you been with J? -About nine years. In nine years you've never felt like grabbing him by the hair and pushing him between your thighs? Yes, I suppose so. So why haven't you? We were always embarrassed. But there's nothing to be embarrassed about! You have to ask for what you want. Ask for what I want. Yes! Tell him what you want, what you feel like. I don't know, I feel like... Well, what do you feel like? I don't know. What do I feel like? I don't know what I feel like. Morning! I miss you, man. -Don't you miss me? -No. Whatever you're about to ask me, don't. It's a beautiful, sunny day, it's Alicia's last day in Madrid, and I want to be with her. But today... history could be made. -What? -Lola's gonna interview Titan. -His first interview. -No! Wasn't yesterday bad enough? -No. -It's a miracle Lola didn't catch you. -It'll be fine. Don't stress. -I'm always stressed thanks to you. I won't take any risks. I'll just give her a couple of cool quotes and fly away. I'll spend as little time with her as possible. I want you to take my phone and at twelve o'clock, send her the audio message I sent you. She'll get it while she's with Titan and won't be suspicious. So, what do you think? I don't see the point of the interview. Anyway, we all know why you're doing it. You're so smart! You know me so well! You know it all. Except for your syllabus! Hey, today the candidates to adopt Wheelie-Dog are coming. I'm going to be out. No, I can't. I've got plans with Alicia. We're going to the park. Seriously? No one does that anymore. Just between me and you, it's what hicks do. So where should I take her? I've got somewhere Alicia will love. The keys to my apartment. Thanks, bro! Know what bro means? It's brother. What should I do? I'm going to open it. -Hey. -Hey, what's up? -How is it going? -What's up? No, you stay there. He hasn't got his wheels on. He might hurt himself. Go on, back inside. Turn around. You're so cute, you've got everyone wrapped around your finger. Wonder who he gets that from? I just came to bring you... some churros for walking in on you in the bathroom. I'm sorry. -Thanks. -Sorry for being an idiot. Anyway, I have to go. I've got an important interview, so... Yeah? Who are you interviewing? I can't say. But it could be really amazing for me. -Cool. -Yeah! So anyway, I'll keep you posted. Okay. -Take care. -Bye. Bye, little one. -See you. -Bye. Good morning, Lola. Thanks for coming. Sorry, I'm still not used to seeing someone fly. I'm a guardian of the universe, and it's impressive even for me. Oh, that's what you are? That is my job, yes. So then you're not human. Look at this! Good as new. See? I'm unbreakable. -Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -Really good. Wheelie-Dog! Hello! -How sweet! -Hey, puppy! How about we interview some people to adopt Wheelie-Dog? Instead of going to the park? Okay, look, we can do the Wheelie-Dog thing real quick then see what happens. Do you feel like it? Yes. I really feel like it. Totally. -Sorry, I'm a bit nervous. -It's normal. Do you mind if I record the interview? No, of course not. -Thanks. -I have nothing to hide. Okay. So, you're a superhero? A real superhero? Yes. I want to set an example, be a symbol of hope. Of changing things. I mean, lots of things. Great! And how do you plan on doing that? With patience. Is that all? Okay. Going back to what you said before about being a guardian of the universe, where do you come from? I come from... Well, I come from... -My origin is irrelevant. I-- -Sorry. -I'll just put that here, okay? -Yes. Far away. Just put that I'm from far away. From far away, but you ended up in Madrid. Why? Because Madrid's close to everything. In half an hour, I can fly anywhere! I have a galactic sense of humor, right? -Yeah. -Stupid! Okay. You're giving me your first ever interview and I'm a nobody. Why me? I've read some of your articles and I think you have lots of potential. I think you're the voice of your generation. Seriously? -Of course you are. -Which articles of mine have you read? The one about the best ice cream in Madrid was pretty good, for example. Okay. WHO IS TITAN? -Hey! -Hey! This place is packed! If you're hungry, get in line. I've got 12 orders to make. People are asking for avocado toast! Has the world gone mad? Here's your coffee. What are you doing? You need a new Javier and I need the cash. Just a few hours, until it calms down in here. -I guess I could use the help. -Cool. No, that's Javier's. Okay. -This one? -That one's okay. What are they celebrating? Nothing. They're shooting a Sportere ad. The crew came for breakfast. You know who's here? That Andoni guy. He's in all the ads. I love that guy. I feel I can really trust him. Well, you shouldn't. That guy's an asshole. Screw all those bookies. So, Titan... We've seen you save a man, who by the way, is a friend of mine, and save the Tío Pepe sign just before it fell on a crowd of innocent people. How do you know when you're needed? I have my ways, but I'm not going to reveal all my secrets now. You don't have a way of knowing, do you? All I can say is that's it's a secret. -Okay, sure-- -But look, I have Twitter. Wha... You can find everything online today. Twitter? Look. For example... A man has just fallen into a well in Chinchón. They can't get him out. This is a job for Titan. -What? -Hold on to my waist. Hold on to me. No, I prefer not to. I'd rather go by car. If you don't mind? Chinchón you said? See you there. I had a dog, Banana, but she died a few months back. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. I'm slowly getting over it. And when I saw your dog with wheels, I just knew. He's called Wheelie-Dog and he's a cutie. -You won't regret it. -I'm sure I won't. I feel like I've won the lottery with him. Yeah, but a dog like this needs more care than a healthy one. Yeah, but it's worth it. If a normal dog gets you more matches on Tinder, imagine having a lame one, huh? Has he had all of his shots? Yes. He's vaccinated and neutered. I've got the papers here. Yes, but the thing is... we have some other people to interview. Do you mind if we call you once we've made a decision? Were you not going to say anything? Yes. I don't know. I don't think he was a good option. Yeah. You're right. Wheelie-Dog wouldn't have been very happy with him. No. José. It's just... I think that things like that... need to be said. There's no well here. No mobile data! Seriously? Please state your reason for calling. Buy data. I didn't understand that. Please state your reason for calling. -Buy data. -I didn't understand that. Please state your reason for calling. Buy data! So anyway, I've been here in the middle of nowhere for 20 minutes and this Batman wannabe hasn't even been able to find the well. I'll let you know how it works out. What a nightmare! I found a car trapped under a fallen tree. I had to rescue a whole family. Are you okay? Don't worry, I'm coming for you. No, Titan. There's no one there. It was just a joke. Some kid posted a story from 2003. That's the thing with Twitter. So, was anyone hurt? Where? The family you rescued. Are they all okay? Yes, they're all good. Glad to hear it. The little girl scratched her cheek on a tree. But the mom was fine. She thanked me over and over. People are so grateful when you save them. The mom had a panic attack. The mom? There were two moms? What do you mean two? You just said the mom was okay, then that she had a panic attack. Yes. Exactly. There were two moms. You have many different kinds of family here on Earth. I'm surprised there are people who still don't... -Right? -...don't accept it. I wish I could use my powers to bring down the patriarchy, but no. No. Men need to take a step back. LIAR Here you go. What are you doing behind there? Adolfo needed help so I offered. That's great! Hey, listen. About our thing. I think that, if we're going to keep doing it, we should have some rules. -Because of what happened yesterday. -Rules? Sure! I love rules, Marcelo. Rewarding people is fine, because you're not hurting anyone, but... the punishing bit... -We don't punish people, we balance karma. -Okay. So when we balance karma, I think that first we should get to know a bit about the person. Son of a bitch! Hey, there's no need. Not you, that guy over there. The jerk who does the ads for the bookies. Can I get a beer over here? What's that? An audio message from my... An audio message. -Listen to it if you like. -You sure? Yes. Go ahead. Hey, Lola! What's up? I just wanted to say that I hope you're well and that you're making progress with your investigations into Titan. That's it. Good luck. Bye. Hi, Javi! Well, I'll tell you about... the whole thing later. Maybe I could come over and we could take Wheelie-Dog out for a walk or... By the way, I don't know if I told you, but I think what you did is really cool. -Shall we carry on or-- -Yeah, sure. I had some more questions here. I've had dogs my whole life. -This is Rocky. -Like the one from Men in Black. I had him before the movie, before they were fashionable. I really miss him. And this one ate spaghetti like in Lady and the Tramp. So I called him Tramp. And this one. This one's Lobo. My cousin did this tattoo. He was cuter in real life, I swear. Excuse me. You must get asked this a lot, but have you ever thought about how gambling is a serious illness and you're fucking up people's lives with your ads? Look, ads don't cause gambling addictions. That's why there's a warning sign: play responsibly. So that's how you sleep at night? They're old enough to know the risks. You're wrong. Teenagers bet online and get hooked their whole fucking lives. If they get into debt, they can get a loan. I advertise those too, you know? What the fuck's wrong with you? Couldn't you advertise foot spray or something? At least that's useful. Or do you just have no moral compass? Are you Voldemort? Want to be known as He Who Must Not Be Named? Look, honey. I'm not listening. My beer. Sure, here. -To your health. -To yours. That was the last one, okay? Marcelo, this is just getting started. Wheelie-Dog, looks like you've got a new owner. A new friend. I don't like the word owner. Just one thing. -Where do you work? -In a small human resources firm. -My favorite resources. Humans! -Yeah. I don't know, isn't it quite a slavish job? I mean, you must be out most of the day. Sometimes I work overtime, yes. I'm worried you and Wheelie-Dog will spend too much time apart because... well, a relationship's like a plant. It needs attention. Yes, but we all have to work. But if she's out all the time, Wheelie-Dog might start to feel lonely. He might start to bite the cushions or pee on the floor. Yes, but Wheelie-Dog should understand that his new friend doesn't feel like getting a shit job and he's doing all this so he can buy the good dog food and take him to the park. Maybe Wheelie-Dog would rather be together in the park than eat good food. Besides, Wheelie-Dog can find his own food. Wheelie-Dog should understand that it takes two and once Wheelie-Dog's finished his exams things will change. Perhaps Wheelie-Dog will be used to living alone by then, or have found something else he likes. Can we talk about this on our own, please? Looks like we're on our own now. -So then let's talk. -Okay. -About what? -You first! -No, you! -What do you feel like? I don't know, you? I feel like going to the park and I feel like having a drink and I feel like you going down on... I'm going to cancel my ticket and stay in Madrid. Yes, because I don't know what I want to do. I just know I want to be with you. A lot of things have happened that we need to explore. -Right? -I totally agree. Really? I want you to stay. Okay. We should call the woman with the tattoos, right? -Call her, now. -Yeah? -Call her. -Call her? Okay. It's here somewhere. You sure like asking questions. I'm a journalist. It's my job. Good, very professional. You got any more? He's going to shoot him! Do something! That's the cycle of life. There are hunters and deer. I can't get involved with that. Where are you going? Run, Bambi! Run, Bambi! Run! -Run away, Bambi! That's it! -What the fuck? You know how long I've been out here? I'm reporting you, you bitch! Look, there's no need to... Try insulting me. -Go on, shoot! -The Tío Pepe guy! That's right. I thought it was a joke. Do I look like I'm laughing? Get lost! Get out of here! Get lost... Happy now? Well... you didn't do that much. -I'm the one who saved the deer. -Okay. Anyway, I think I've got enough. -We can call it a day. -Sure, you should get going. I'm going to hang here a while. Work out a bit. Okay. -Bye. -Bye! Son of a bitch. Shit! Damn it! Damn it. Best case scenario, he's a flying fireman. Worst case... he's a useless idiot. What a letdown. Why does the first ever superhero have to be a guy? They're all fucking useless. Even the cosmos is sexist. You know what? Screw Titan. We can do what he should be doing. And we'd do it better for sure. Then you know what? Let's do it. Yeah. Why the hell not? Do you remember Marcelo? -The eggplant guy. -Oh, yeah. We've been doing this thing together. The Karma Police. Hey, don't laugh! Hang on, did you say the Karma Police? Come with me a second. -Please! -Adolfo, I'm going for a smoke. -You smoke? -Only during work hours. For God's sake. -What's up? -Oh, she's there. -How'd it go? -It was a fucking nightmare. How could you let me do this? You're so irresponsible! I told you not to, you idiot! Don't tell me Lola found you out. No, but Lola doesn't like Titan, okay? -Quiet. -She likes him even less now than before. She's more of a Marvel girl. Where's Wheelie-Dog? Someone took Wheelie-Dog a while ago. -Who took him? -A girl. She's really nice. She's got tattoos of all the dogs she's had. Why did you give her the dog? You told me to! Why do you listen to me? You know I'm an idiot! Basket, set, game, match, try and plenty of goals! Bet with Sportere, bet to win, bet it all, but play responsibly! Cut! Pretty good, huh? That was awesome! If Titan won't stop him, we'll just have to do it ourselves. Yeah, he's so... I'm starting to like the name, the Karma Police. The fucking Karma Police. The fucking Karma Police.
