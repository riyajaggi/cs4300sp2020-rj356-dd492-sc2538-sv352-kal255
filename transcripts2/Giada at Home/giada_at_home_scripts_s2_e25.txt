 Closed Captions provided by  Scripps Networks, LLC. Captioned by Closed Captioning Services, Inc. (Giada) JACKSON HOLE, WYOMING, HAS A SPECIAL PLACE  IN MY HEART. MY FAMILY AND I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THERE WHEN WE WERE KIDS. IF YOU'RE EVER THERE,  CHECK OUT THE ESKIMO BARS AT THE SNAKE RIVER GRILL. IT'S A DESSERT THAT YOU TASTE  AND GO... MMM! SO I FIGURED  I SHOULD LEARN HOW TO MAKE A VERSION OF IT AT HOME. SO IT STARTS  WITH A BROWNIE LAYER. AND THAT'S WHAT  WE'RE GONNA START WITH NOW. WE'RE GONNA  START MAKING OUR BROWNIES. SO 1 3/4 CUPS OF BROWNIE MIX, NICE FUDGY, THICK BROWNIE MIX. 2 TABLESPOONS OF WATER. JUST LIKE WHEN YOU USE  ANY BROWNIE MIX, YOU KINDA HAVE TO FOLLOW  A LITTLE BIT OF THE DIRECTIONS. BUT WE'RE NOT USING  THE WHOLE BOX SO WE'RE GONNA SORT OF TAILOR  WHAT WE'RE GONNA ADD TO IT. THEN 1/4 CUP OF VEGETABLE OIL. AND THERE WE GO. AND THE VEGETABLE OIL  ADDS MOISTURE BUT NO FLAVOR. SO NOW WHISK IT ALL TOGETHER. IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME  TO MAKE THIS DESSERT, BUT MOST OF ALL THAT TIME  IS JUST FREEZING TIME. BUT INSTEAD OF SERVING  THIS DESSERT WITH A SIDE OF CARAMEL SAUCE, I'M ACTUALLY GONNA ADD  THE CARAMEL INSIDE OF THIS. WE'RE GONNA LAYER THIS ALL UP  AND FREEZE IT. THERE WE GO. TIME TO ADD  A COUPLE OTHER THINGS. SO LET'S ADD 1/2 A CUP OF CHOCOLATE CHIPS. AND WE'RE JUST USING  SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS. THESE WILL MELT AND BE SO GOOD. THERE WE GO. LET'S SEE IF THESE ARE ANY GOOD. OH, YEAH. ALWAYS TASTE  YOUR CHOCOLATE CHIPS. ONE MORE THING TO ADD-- MILK CHOCOLATE AND TOFFEE BARS, BECAUSE I THOUGHT  IT'D BE REALLY GOOD TO ADD IT IN HERE. IT JUST GIVES IT  EXTRA CHOCOLATE FLAVOR WHICH IS WHAT I WANT--  SOMETHING REALLY RICH. ♪♪ SO TAKE A SPATULA AND MIX  THE WHOLE THING TOGETHER. JUST MIX IT  UNTIL THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND THE TOFFEE CHOCOLATE BAR  ARE KIND OF JUST MIXED IN. SO THEN SWAP THIS OVER. AND I JUST BUTTERED  A GLASS BAKING DISH. THIS WAY YOU CAN ALSO SEE  ALL THE LAYERS, 'CAUSE IT'S A GLASS DISH. AND THEN JUST SPREAD IT OUT, AND WE'RE GONNA BAKE THIS  AT 350 FOR 20 MINUTES UNTIL IT'S NICE AND MOIST. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY GOOD. ♪♪ SO I'M STARTING TO HEAT  1/3 CUP OF HEAVY CREAM TO START MELTING  MY CHOCOLATE CHIPS. SO WHILE THAT HEATS UP,  TAKE A LOOK AT MY BROWNIES. THEY BAKED  AND COMPLETELY COOLED, AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT  TO COMPLETELY COOL THE BROWNIES BEFORE YOU ADD THE ICE CREAM. AND I HAVE 1 PINT  OF DOLCE de LECHE ICE CREAM. BASICALLY,  DOLCE de LECHE ICE CREAM IS CARAMEL ICE CREAM, AND IT IS CREAMY  AND SO DELICIOUS. MM-MMM! SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU SPREAD  THE DOLCE de LECHE ICE CREAM RIGHT OVER  THE BROWNIE. PERFECT. SO NOW POP IT IN THE FREEZER TO FREEZE THE ICE CREAM  AND THE BROWNIE TOGETHER. AND WHILE THAT FREEZES... I'M GONNA GRAB  MY MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS. SO ONCE YOU HEAT UP THE CREAM, TURN OFF THE HEAT AND ADD ABOUT 2 CUPS. AND JUST STIR  UNTIL THE MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS HAVE COMPLETELY MELTED  AND IT'S NICE AND SMOOTH. THEN WE'LL POUR IT  OVER THE ICE CREAM. THEN I'M JUST GONNA SWITCH GEARS AND GO TO ONE  OF MY FAVORITE ALL-TIME DISHES IN SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO-- MY COUSCOUS-STUFFED PEPPERS  WITH BASIL SAUCE. THESE VIBRANT PEPPERS ARE LOADED  WITH MOUTH-WATERING FLAVORS. SO I HAVE MY MELTED CHOCOLATE. LOOK HOW GOOD THAT LOOKS.  WHOO, BABY! SO IT'S TIME TO TOP  THE DOLCE de LECHE ICE CREAM WITH THE MELTED MILK CHOCOLATE. YOU WANT TO WORK  KIND OF QUICKLY SO THAT THE CHOCOLATE  DOES NOT MELT THE ICE CREAM. SO JUST SPREAD IT ALL OUT. WE'RE GONNA POP THE WHOLE THING  IN THE FREEZER, AND YOU WANT TO LEAVE IT  IN THE FREEZER FOR A FEW HOURS. GORGEOUS! THAT'S GORGEOUS, TOO. MMM! ♪♪ A VISIT TO SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO,  ALWAYS LEAVES ME INSPIRED. THIS IS GORGEOUS! THE COLORS ARE EXTRAORDINARY, JUST LIKE THE FOOD. OOH! (man) RELLENO. THE SANTACAFé'S  VEGETARIAN RELLENO HAD ME AT "HELLO." YOU ALMOST DON'T WANT  TO CUT INTO THEM. THEY'RE JUST TOO BEAUTIFUL  TO EAT. THIS IS A GREAT ONE  TO TRY AT HOME, MAYBE WITH A CALIFORNIA TWIST. I JUST STARTED CLEANING  SOME BELL PEPPERS FOR MY COUSCOUS-STUFFED PEPPERS  WITH BASIL SAUCE. CUT THE BOTTOM JUST A LITTLE BIT  JUST SO THEY STAND UP STRAIGHT, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT  THE STUFFING TO FALL OUT AS IT'S COOKING. AND I LIKE TO USE  ASSORTED COLORS. IT REMINDS ME OF SANTA FE,  WHICH IS A VERY COLORFUL CITY. AND THEN OVER, I HAVE  1 CUP OF CHICKEN BROTH WITH 2 TEASPOONS OF CUMIN, AND THE CUMIN KIND OF GIVES IT  A WARMTH AND A SMOKINESS. AND TO THAT, WE ARE GONNA ADD 3/4 OF A CUP OF COUSCOUS. AND WHEN I HAD THIS DISH  ACTUALLY IN SANTA FE, IT WAS MADE WITH QUINOA,  WHICH IS A PERUVIAN GRAIN, BUT I THOUGHT I'D DO IT  WITH COUSCOUS-- MAKE IT A LOT EASIER  AND A LOT FASTER. BRING THE BROTH  UP TO A BOIL. TURN OFF THE HEAT. BASICALLY,  LET THE HEAT OF THE BROTH STEAM AND COOK THE COUSCOUS, AND IT LITERALLY ONLY TAKES,  LIKE, FIVE MINUTES. SO WE'RE GONNA START BY ADDING  SOME CURRANTS, AND THEY'RE LIKE RAISINS. WE'RE GONNA ADD  ABOUT A 1/4 CUP OF CURRANTS. THEY'RE NICE AND SWEET,  AND THEY'RE LITTLE, SO THEY KIND OF MATCH THE SIZE  OF THE COUSCOUS. AND THEN 1/2 CUP  OF FETA CHEESE, WHICH IS  A GREEK SHEEP'S MILK CHEESE. IT'S GOT A NICE SHARP FLAVOR. NOW WE NEED SOME GARBANZO BEANS THAT I ALREADY DRAINED  AND RINSED. WE'VE GOT 1 CUP,  AND THEY KIND OF HAVE A CRUNCH, A LITTLE STARCHINESS, SO THEY ADD BODY  AND, LIKE, MEATINESS TO THE FILLING OF THE PEPPERS. AND 1 CUP  OF BABY SPINACH LEAVES. AND THE SPINACH  IS JUST GOOD FOR YOU, AND IT ADDS A REALLY NICE COLOR  AND TEXTURE. JUST CHOP IT UP, 'CAUSE YOU WANT THE SPINACH  TO WILT AND COOK INTO THE COUSCOUS  IN THE OVEN. THERE WE GO. NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD 2 TO 3 TABLESPOONS OF OLIVE OIL JUST TO KEEP IT ALL MOIST. AND A LITTLE BIT OF SALT  AND A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER. THERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT, SO NOW LET'S TAKE  A LOOK AT THE COUSCOUS. IT SHOULD BE DONE. OOH, YEAH.  IT LOOKS GOOD. YOU CAN SMELL THE CUMIN. TAKE A FORK AND FLUFF IT UP  BEFORE YOU SPOON IT. THERE WE GO. OKAY. WE ARE GONNA ADD IT RIGHT IN HERE  WITH ALL THE OTHER INGREDIENTS. OKAY, SO NOW  TOSS IT ALL TOGETHER, AND YOU CAN ALREADY START TO SEE  HOW BEAUTIFUL THIS IS GONNA BE. (inhales sharply, sighs) IT SMELLS GOOD. START OVER HERE  AND JUST KIND OF FILL OUR BEAUTIFUL PEPPERS  WITH ALL OF THIS. I LIKE THEM TO BE FULL, BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE  ALL THE STUFF ON THE TOP. AND WE'RE GONNA ADD  1/2 CUP OF WATER. THE WATER  IS GONNA STEAM THE PEPPERS. THERE WE GO. AND JUST TO FINISH IT OFF, DRIZZLE A LITTLE BIT  OF OLIVE OIL JUST TO KEEP THE TOPS  NICE AND MOIST. THERE WE GO. WE'RE GONNA BAKE THIS  AT 400 DEGREES FOR ABOUT AN HOUR. SO WHILE THOSE BEAUTIES BAKE, I'M GONNA GET STARTED  ON THE SAUCE. NOW WHEN I HAD THIS DISH  IN SANTA FE, IT WAS LIKE  A SPICY BELL PEPPER SAUCE. BUT I THOUGHT  IT'D BE REALLY, REALLY PRETTY TO MAKE IT WITH A BASIL SAUCE, NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE SAUCE  WOULD BE FRESH, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT WOULD ADD  BEAUTIFUL COLOR ALONGSIDE THE PEPPERS. WE'RE GONNA START  WITH ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC... AND A LITTLE BIT  OF LEMON JUICE. NEED A LITTLE BIT OF ACIDITY, SO JUST 2 TEASPOONS  OF LEMON JUICE. PERFECT. WE GOT THAT. NOW WE NEED THE CREAMY PART, AND WE NEED SOME FRESH BASIL. PERFECT. SO I GOT THIS BEAUTIFUL, FRESH,  SWEET BASIL TO ADD. 1 CUP OF BASIL. 1/2 A CUP OF CRèME FRAîCHE. IT'S GONNA GIVE, LIKE,  A CREAMINESS AND A THICKNESS TO THIS WHOLE THING. A TABLESPOON OF WATER. AND A COUPLE TABLESPOONS  OF EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL TO REALLY GIVE IT  A NICE ITALIAN FLAVOR. AND JUST A 1/4 TEASPOON  OF SUGAR. AND THE SUGAR JUST BALANCES OUT  THE ACIDITY. THEN WE NEED  A LITTLE BIT OF SALT, AND WE NEED  A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER. ♪♪ AND THAT IS IT. NOW LET'S JUST TASTE IT. MMM, PERFECT. OOH! I LOVE THAT TANG  FROM THE CRèME FRAîCHE, THE LEMON  AND THAT SWEET BASIL. SO THE SAUCE IS DONE.  PEPPERS ARE IN THE OVEN. UP NEXT, A HOMETOWN FAVORITE  FROM MY CITY, L.A.-- MEATY MUSHROOM LASAGNA  WITH A LITTLE PROSCIUTTO. (Giada) WHEN THE LIGHTS  GO DOWN IN L.A., THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO BE  THAN ANGELINI OSTERIA... (man speaking Italian) (Giada) GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED  ITALIAN COMFORT FOOD SERVED ELBOW TO ELBOW. WONDERFUL!  WOW! (Giada) AND "NONNA ELVIRA'S"  LASAGNA VERDE IS THE BEST EVER. GOOD HIT! ANYTHING THAT SAYS  "NONNA" ON IT, IT'S GRANDMOTHERS MADE IT, SO YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE GOOD.  YEAH. SO GINO ANGELINI, THE CHEF, MAKES THIS FANTASTIC LASAGNA. HIS IS MADE WITH LOTS OF MEAT. MINE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS GONNA BE MADE WITH MUSHROOMS. BUT I'M TELLING YOU, IT IS GONNA  BE JUST AS GOOD AS THAT ONE. WE'RE GONNA ADD LOTS OF FLAVORING AND LOTS OF CHEESE. YOU WANT TO USE A MEDIUM ONION, AND THE ONION JUST ADDS  MORE FLAVOR TO THE MUSHROOMS. ADD THE ONION RIGHT INTO  THE BUTTER AND THE OLIVE OIL. ADD A LITTLE BIT OF SALT AND A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER TO THE ONIONS AND START COOKING 'EM DOWN. WE'RE GONNA ADD  THREE GARLIC CLOVES. JUST WANT TO CHOP THE GARLIC. PERFECT. SO NOW WE ADD THE GARLIC ON TOP OF THE ONIONS. OKAY. SO I HAVE A NICE ASSORTMENT  OF MUSHROOMS. WE'VE GOT SOME BUTTON MUSHROOMS, SOME CREMINI MUSHROOMS AND THEN SOME NICE SHIITAKES  RIGHT HERE. SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUST CUT THEM IN FOURS. ♪♪ NOW WE WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF SALT AND SOME PEPPER. SPREAD THEM OUT A LITTLE BIT. ALL RIGHT,  NOW I ALSO WANT TO ADD SOME ROSEMARY AND SOME THYME. AND THE ROSEMARY  IS NICE AND PINEY, SO I THINK IT WORKS REALLY WELL  WITH THE MUSHROOMS. AND THEN JUST CHOP UP  THE ROSEMARY JUST TO KIND OF BREAK IT UP,  RELEASE THE NICE AROMA. REALLY GET ALL THE FLAVOR OUT. AND THEN WE'VE ALSO GOT  SOME THYME, A VERY HARDY HERB THAT WORKS  REALLY WELL WITH THE MUSHROOMS. AND CHOP UP THE THYME AS WELL. NOW ADD IT TO THE MUSHROOMS, AND WE'RE GONNA LET THIS  ALL COOK TOGETHER UNTIL THE MUSHROOMS  HAVE SOFTENED AND REDUCED DOWN. TIME TO GET STARTED  ON MY BéCHAMEL. AND BéCHAMEL IS BASICALLY  JUST A WHITE CREAM SAUCE. VERY SIMPLE. SO MELT ABOUT 5 TABLESPOONS  OF UNSALTED BUTTER. AND THE BéCHAMEL IS WHAT MAKES THIS LASAGNA  SO CREAMY. OKAY, TIME TO ADD 1/2 A CUP OF FLOUR. THERE WE GO. AND YOU WANT TO COOK IT FOR, LIKE, A MINUTE AND A HALF OR SO. THAT WAY, YOU COOK OUT ALL OF THAT GRITTINESS  IN THE FLOUR. AND WE'RE GONNA ADD 4 CUPS OF WHOLE MILK, ROOM TEMPERATURE, SO THAT IT'S REALLY EASILY  INCORPORATED IN HERE. THERE WE GO. AND START WHISKING AWAY. AND THE WHOLE TRICK HERE IS TO WHISK FOR A FEW MINUTES UNTIL THE WHOLE THING  THICKENS UP. ♪♪ YOU STICK A SPOON IN IT, AND YOU SEE HOW IT COATS THE BACK OF THE SPOON LIKE THAT? AND IF YOU RUN YOUR FINGER  LIKE THAT, AND IT STAYS SEPARATE, THAT'S WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S READY. I LOVE ADDING NUTMEG TO ANY KIND OF CREAM SAUCE. AND WHAT I HAVE HERE  IS A WHOLE NUTMEG, AND I'M JUST GONNA  GRATE IT MYSELF. AND NUTMEG IS KIND OF WARM  AND SPICY, AND SO IT ADDS LOTS OF FLAVOR  TO ANY CREAM SAUCE. I WANT TO SEASON IT  WITH A LITTLE BIT OF SALT AND A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER. AND... NOW... GIVE IT A STIR. LET'S SEE HOW THE MUSHROOMS  ARE DOING. MUSHROOMS ARE DONE. LET'S TURN THEM OFF. THEY LOOK GREAT. LET'S ADD THE PROSCIUTTO. LOOK AT THAT BABY. SO LET'S TAKE  THE PROSCIUTTO OUT. NOW WHAT I DID  WAS I ASKED MY DELI MAN TO CUT IT AN 1/8 OF AN INCH  INSTEAD OF PAPER THIN, WHICH IS HOW YOU USUALLY FIND  THE PROSCIUTTO. AND JUST CUT IT UP. ♪♪ THERE WE GO. AND WE PUT IT DIRECTLY INTO THE BéCHAMEL. IT'S REALLY PRETTY. THEN SOME SMOKED MOZZARELLA. AND THE SMOKED MOZZARELLA  ADDS A LITTLE SMOKINESS, A LITTLE BIT OF MORE OF A BITE. IT'S A LITTLE TANGIER,  FULL-BODIED, WHICH I THINK REALLY WORKS WELL  WITH THE MUSHROOMS. AND WE'RE JUST GONNA GRATE  ABOUT 2 CUPS. WE'RE GONNA USE HALF  IN THE BéCHAMEL AND THE OTHER HALF  FOR THE TOPPING. ♪♪ AND THEN 1/2 CUP  OF GRATED PARMIGIANO-REGGIANO-- A NICE SALTY BITE. AND THE WARM BéCHAMEL  MELTS THE CHEESES. THIS IS BASICALLY  ITALIAN COMFORT FOOD. I'VE GOT  MY BUTTERED BAKING DISH. WE ALSO NEED OUR LASAGNA SHEETS. SO THIS IS SPINACH LASAGNA, AND I BASICALLY COOKED IT  IN BOILING WATER AND THEN I ADDED  A LITTLE BIT OF OIL SO THEY DON'T STICK  TO EACH OTHER. SO THE FIRST THING  YOU WANT TO DO IS ADD A LITTLE BIT OF BéCHAMEL  TO THE BOTTOM AND JUST KIND OF SPREAD IT OUT. JUST SO THE NOODLES  STAY NICE AND MOIST AND DON'T BURN  AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAN. LET'S DO OUR FIRST LAYER  OF LASAGNA. SO SPINACH LASAGNA SHEETS AND LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL  THESE ARE. SO THEN... LET'S DO... HALF THE MUSHROOM MIXTURE RIGHT THERE AND KIND OF JUST SPREAD IT OUT  NICE AND MEATY. THEN WE NEED... A BUNCH OF THE BéCHAMEL  RIGHT OVER THE TOP. ♪♪ AND THE REST OF THE MUSHROOMS. ♪♪ TOP IT  WITH THE REST OF THE BéCHAMEL. PERFECT. SO THE REMAINDER  OF THE SMOKED MOZZARELLA RIGHT OVER THE TOP. SEE, AND IT SMELLS SO GOOD. ANOTHER 1/2 CUP  OF GRATED PARMIGIANO RIGHT OVER THE TOP. AND THEN I LIKE  TO FINISH IT ALL OFF WITH A LITTLE DRIZZLE  OF EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL JUST TO CREATE  A NICE GOLDEN CRUST. AND WE'RE GONNA BAKE THIS  AT 400 DEGREES FOR 40 MINUTES. AND ALL I HAVE LEFT TO DO NOW IS FINISH OFF  MY FROZEN BROWNIE SUNDAE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF A LIGHT,  FRESH STRAWBERRY SAUCE. ♪♪ I ALREADY PLATED SOME OF MY MUSHROOM LASAGNA AND MY COUSCOUS-STUFFED PEPPERS. SO LET'S GO TO THE PEPPER FIRST. OOH! THE PEPPER IS SO TENDER! MMM. MMM! YOU KNOW, THE PEPPER IS TENDER, AND THAT BASIL SAUCE JUST  FINISHES IT OFF BEAUTIFULLY. MMM! MMM! GOTTA MOVE ON  TO THE LASAGNA HERE. SOME PASTA AND SOME CHEESE. MMM. CREAMY. TWO OF MY FAVORITE DISHES. SO I'VE GOT A BAG OF FROZEN  AND DEFROSTED STRAWBERRIES. I'M GONNA MAKE  A REALLY EASY STRAWBERRY SAUCE. THEN WE NEED 1/3 CUP  OF POWDERED SUGAR. NICE AND SWEET. AND THEN JUST A TEASPOON OF LEMON JUICE JUST TO EVEN OUT THE SWEETNESS  OF THE STRAWBERRIES AND THE POWDERED SUGAR. HERE WE GO. ALL RIGHT. A LITTLE BIT OF SAUCE RIGHT OVER THE TOP. LOOK HOW GORGEOUS THAT IS. SO HERE WE GO. MMM. OH, MY GOSH. MMM! I'M GETTING THAT TOFFEE,  ALL THAT RICH BROWNIE. SO CHEWY, SO RICH. MMM! AND THE DOLCE de LECHE ICE CREAM AND THEN, OF COURSE, THE TANGY  AND SWEET STRAWBERRY SAUCE AND MILK CHOCOLATE. HONESTLY,  THERE IS NOTHING BETTER. I AM IN ABSOLUTE HEAVEN.
