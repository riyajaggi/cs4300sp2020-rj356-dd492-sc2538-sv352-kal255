Closed Captions provided by  Scripps Networks, LLC. Captioned by Closed Captioning Services, Inc. I'M STARTING WITH MY RUSTIC  VEGETABLE AND POLENTA SOUP, AND I'VE ALREADY CHOPPED  ONE ONION, TWO CARROTS, AND I'M FINISHING UP  MY SECOND ZUCCHINI. AND I REALLY LOVE THIS SOUP. NOT ONLY IS IT COMFORTING,  BUT IT'S SO EASY AND FAST. AND THAT IS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR ON A WEEKNIGHT.

 WE'RE JUST GONNA  TURN ON THE STOVE, A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL,  AND WE'RE GONNA START SAUTéING THE ONION AND THE CARROTS. THIS IS A STAPLE SOUP  WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. LET'S DO THE ONIONS  AND THE CARROTS FIRST, BECAUSE THEY TAKE  A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO COOK. AND WE'RE GONNA ADD  A LITTLE BIT OF SALT WE'RE GONNA ADD  A LITTLE BIT OF GARLIC, JUST THREE CLOVES OF GARLIC. WE'RE JUST GONNA SMASH, PEEL THEM, AND LEAVE THEM WHOLE, SO THAT WAY, IT DOESN'T  MAKE THE SOUP TOO GARLICKY. AND THREE. PERFECT. GIVE IT A QUICK STIR, AND WE'RE GONNA ADD  THE ZUCCHINI IN NEXT. SO IT'S SORT OF LIKE  A MINESTRONE SOUP, BUT WITH POLENTA  INSTEAD OF PASTA OR RICE. THERE WE GO. SO WHILE THAT COOKS,  LET'S ADD THREE ROMA TOMATOES. THEY GIVE THE SOUP  A SLIGHTLY PINK COLOR, BUT LOTS OF FRESH FLAVOR. SO WE'RE GONNA ADD  A LITTLE BIT OF FRESH THYME, NICE AND LEMONY, SO I THINK IT WORKS  REALLY WELL WITH THE VEGGIES. SO WE'LL JUST TAKE THE LEAVES  RIGHT OFF OF THE STEM. AH, IT SMELLS SO GOOD. NICE AND FRESH. NOW LET'S GET  SOME PARSLEY IN HERE. THERE WE GO.  JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY. SO LET'S ADD THE THYME  AND THE PARSLEY TOGETHER. GET IT ALL IN THERE. OKAY. WE NEED SOME CHICKEN BROTH, AND WE'RE GONNA GRAB  THE POLENTA, TOO. THERE WE GO. SO WE'RE GONNA USE  4 CUPS OF CHICKEN BROTH, AND I LIKE TO USE  LOW-SODIUM CHICKEN BROTH, BECAUSE AS THE SOUP COOKS,  THE CHICKEN BROTH REDUCES, AND IF IT'S REALLY SALTY, WELL, THEN YOUR SOUP IS PROBABLY GONNA BE PRETTY SALTY. AND WE'RE GONNA ADD  1/3 OF A CUP OF POLENTA. SO WHAT I DID IS I GOT  INSTANT POLENTA, 'CAUSE IT'S GONNA  COOK A LOT FASTER. ESPECIALLY FOR A WEEKNIGHT,  IT'S A GREAT SHORTCUT. AND JUST ADD IT  RIGHT INTO THE SOUP. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA  BRING THAT UP TO A BOIL, AND THE POLENTA STARTS  TO ABSORB THE CHICKEN BROTH AND BECOMES NICE AND THICK, AND IT CREATES  THIS GREAT, HEARTY SOUP. LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL  THAT POLENTA IS, AND SEE HOW THICK  AND RUSTIC IT IS? SO WE'RE GONNA FINISH IT WITH A LITTLE SOMETHING  EXTRA SPECIAL. WE'RE GONNA DO  3 TABLESPOONS OF BUTTER. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT  POLENTA AND BUTTER TOGETHER. IT JUST MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE SILKY. SO WE TURN OFF THE HEAT, AND OUR RUSTIC SOUP IS DONE. NOW FOR THE BEST PART--  GOT TO TASTE IT. OKAY, THIS IS HOT, SO BEAR WITH ME. I LOVE THE HERBS IN HERE, AND THE VEGGIES STILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TEXTURE TO THEM. THIS IS TRUE COMFORT FOOD  ON A WEEKNIGHT. ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,  ANOTHER ONE OF MY FAVORITES-- FUSILLI WITH PECORINO ROMANO  AND BLACK PEPPER. SO EASY AND SO GOOD. A FAMILY FAVORITE  THAT'S QUICK AND EASY-- SPIRAL PASTA  WITH A BLEND OF BABY SPINACH AND A WHOLE LOT OF CHEESE. I'M JUST  SALTING MY PASTA WATER FOR MY FUSILLI WITH PECORINO  ROMANO AND BLACK PEPPER. AND THIS IS SORT OF, UM, A FUN SPIN  ON A CLASSIC ITALIAN DISH, SO CLASSICALLY, IT'S KNOWN  AS PASTA CACIO e PEPE. UM, CACIO BEING THE PECORINO  ROMANO, AND PEPE BEING PEPPER. WE'RE GONNA START  WITH SOME FUSILLI PASTA, WHICH IS THIS, LIKE, LITTLE  CORKSCREW TYPE OF PASTA, AND THE SAUCE WILL GET  STUCK IN BETWEEN THE RIDGES, WHICH MAKES IT REALLY YUMMY. SO WE'RE GONNA DO 1 POUND OF PASTA, OF FUSILLI, BUT YOU COULD USE WHATEVER  YOUR FAVORITE SHORT PASTA IS. AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT  A QUICK LITTLE STIR. THIS IS GONNA COOK FOR A FEW  MINUTES UNTIL IT'S AL DENTE. SO WHILE THAT COOKS, LET'S GET STARTED ON THE SAUCE. WE'RE GONNA START  WITH 1/4 CUP OF OLIVE OIL. TO THE OLIVE OIL, I AM GOING TO ADD TWO GARLIC CLOVES, SO WE'RE GONNA START  HEATING UP THE OLIVE OIL. SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO  IS THE CLASSIC WAY THAT, IN MY FAMILY,  WE ALWAYS MADE A QUICK SAUCE. MY MOM WOULD JUST  TAKE TWO GARLIC CLOVES, SMASH AND PEEL THEM,  ADD THEM TO THE OLIVE OIL, AND JUST LEAVE IT IN THERE  FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES, SO THE GARLIC  CAN INFUSE THE OLIVE OIL. SO LET'S DO IT. ADD IT DIRECTLY TO THE PAN. WE'RE GONNA ADD  5 CUPS OF BABY SPINACH. SPINACH TENDS TO WILT DOWN  QUITE A BIT, SO IN ORDER TO MAKE IT  GO A LONG WAY, YOU NEED ALL OF THIS SPINACH. I LIKE TO CHOP IT UP. IT JUST MAKES  FOR A MORE EVEN SAUCE. SO EVERY BITE OF THE FUSILLI HAS  A LITTLE BIT OF SPINACH IN IT. OKAY, SO NOW  THAT WE'VE CHOPPED THAT UP-- THE MINUTE  YOU START SMELLING THE GARLIC, YOU NEED TO GET RID  OF THE GARLIC, 'CAUSE IT CAN BURN  VERY, VERY QUICKLY. THERE WE GO. I'M GONNA TURN DOWN  THE HEAT A LITTLE BIT, AND WE'RE GONNA  ADD THE SPINACH. WE'RE GONNA ADD  A LITTLE BIT OF SALT, AND HERE WE GO  WITH THE PEPPER. SO I HAVE COARSE GROUND PEPPER,  INSTEAD OF FINE PEPPER, WHICH IS WHAT I USUALLY USE. BUT YOU NEED THE COARSE  GROUND PEPPER IN THIS PASTA, 'CAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT  PEPPER AND CHEESE. 2 TEASPOONS NOW.  WE'LL ADD 2 TEASPOONS LATER. WE'LL JUST  WILT DOWN THE SPINACH. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ADD  SOME MASCARPONE CHEESE. SO I HAVE  1 CUP OF MASCARPONE, AND THE TRICK  TO MAKING THIS SAUCE IS TO MAKE SURE THE MASCARPONE  IS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, BECAUSE THAT WAY, IT MELTS  BEAUTIFULLY WITH THE SPINACH. SO WE'RE GONNA GRAB  A LITTLE SPATULA AND SPOON IT OUT,  AND I LOVE MASCARPONE. IT'S ONE OF THOSE CHEESES  I ALWAYS HAVE IN MY FRIDGE, BECAUSE YOU CAN ADD IT  TO SAVORY AND SWEET DISHES. AND WE'RE GONNA  GIVE IT A QUICK STIR. IT CREATES  A NICE CREAMY SAUCE. LET'S TRY THE PASTA. OOH, YEAH, BABY, IT'S AL DENTE. SO TIME TO GET IT OUT AND PUT IT  DIRECTLY INTO THE SAUCEPAN. I'M GONNA GRAB JUST A LITTLE BIT  OF PASTA WATER. THE STARCHES  IN THE PASTA WATER CREATE THE MOST SILKY SAUCE. WE'RE GONNA ADD THE CHEESE. SO WE'RE GONNA ADD 1 1/2 CUPS  OF GRATED PECORINO ROMANO. AND YOU CAN BUY THIS  PRE-GRATED THESE DAYS, WHICH MAKES WEEKNIGHT COOKING A LOT EASIER. AND, YOU KNOW,  I LIKE TO GRATE MY OWN CHEESE, BUT SOME NIGHTS,  I JUST DON'T HAVE TIME, SO I DO BUY  THE PRE-GRATED SOMETIMES, JUST TO MAKE IT  A LOT EASIER ON MYSELF. WE STILL HAVE TO ADD 2 MORE  TEASPOONS OF BLACK PEPPER, COARSE BLACK PEPPER. OKAY, WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE  THAT THIS TASTES JUST RIGHT. MM-MMM.  IT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. ALL RIGHT, SO UP NEXT, IT'S MY BALSAMIC-GLAZED SALMON. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY FAST  AND REALLY EASY. IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS  ENTRéE THAT YOU CAN WHIP TOGETHER  IN NO TIME. IT'S TIME TO MAKE ONE OF MY FAVORITE WEEKNIGHT MEALS, MY BALSAMIC-GLAZED SALMON, AND WE'RE GONNA  START WITH THE GLAZE. IT'S 3/4 OF A CUP  OF BALSAMIC VINEGAR, AND THE BALSAMIC VINEGAR  WILL REDUCE DOWN AND GET KIND OF STICKY  AND SWEET AND THICK. SO WE'RE GONNA  POUR 3/4 OF A CUP OF BALSAMIC VINEGAR IN THERE. WE'RE GONNA ADD  SOME MAPLE SYRUP, AND WE'RE GONNA DO  2 TABLESPOONS OF MAPLE SYRUP. IT'S SWEET,  BUT IT'S ALSO THICK AND SLIGHTLY SMOKY, SO IT REALLY GIVES THIS GLAZE A REALLY NICE  TEXTURE AND FLAVOR. WE'RE ALSO GONNA ADD  A LITTLE BIT OF MUSTARD, SO WE'RE GONNA USE  DIJON MUSTARD. UM, I LIKE THE WINE IN HERE.  IT GIVES IT SORT OF A TANG. JUST 1 TABLESPOON OF DIJON MUSTARD. WE'RE GONNA  TURN ON THE HEAT... AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO  IS DISSOLVE IT ALL TOGETHER. ALL RIGHT,  AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA ADD ONE CLOVE OF GARLIC. THAT'S ALL WE NEED  TO FLAVOR THIS. SO JUST SMASH AND PEEL. THIS IS A NICE SORT OF ASIAN,  ITALIAN-INSPIRED FLAVOR COMBO. OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA  LET THAT REDUCE DOWN. SO NOW  I'VE GOT MY BAKING SHEET THAT I LINED  WITH PARCHMENT PAPER. LET'S GRAB THE SALMON. HERE WE GO. TAKE A LOOK HOW BEAUTIFUL AND PINK THIS IS. SO I HAVE FOUR PIECES OF SALMON. WHAT I WANT TO DO  IS SEASON THEM WITH A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL,  SALT AND PEPPER. VERY, VERY SIMPLE, BECAUSE THE GLAZE IS GONNA  GIVE IT LOTS OF FLAVOR. JUST SEASON IT A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW, ON A WEEKNIGHT,  WHEN YOU WANT SOME FISH, THIS IS SUCH  AN EASY DISH TO MAKE. AND WE'RE GONNA PUT  ALL OF THE SALMON PIECES ON THE BAKING SHEET. SO NOW I'M GONNA POP IT  IN THE OVEN AT 400 DEGREES FOR ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN MINUTES. SO WHILE THAT BAKES, WE'RE GONNA MOVE THIS OVER, LET IT CONTINUE TO REDUCE DOWN, AND LET'S START ON THE REALLY FAST VEGGIES. SO I'VE GOT TWO SHALLOTS. THEY GIVE A NICE ONION FLAVOR,  BUT E'RE SUPER-DUPER MILD, AND WE'RE GONNA  JUST CHOP THE SHALLOTS. TWO CLOVES OF GARLIC. WE'VE GOT ONE,  AND WE'VE GOT TWO. LET'S GRAB THE VEGGIES. SO I'VE GOT  SNAP PEAS AND EDAMAME. SO WE'RE GONNA  ADD THOSE RIGHT THERE, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO  COOK THEM FOR VERY LONG. GIVE THEM A NICE STIR. ALL RIGHT, TO THE SNAP PEAS,  WE'RE ALSO GONNA ADD 2 CUPS OF EDAMAME. AND JADE IS  A BIG LOVER OF EDAMAME. AND YOU JUST WARM THEM THROUGH, SO THAT EVERYTHING KEEPS  THAT NICE GREEN COLOR. LET'S CHECK ON THE FISH,  'CAUSE I CAN SMELL IT, AND IT SMELLS REALLY GOOD. OH, YEAH. IT'S READY, AND THE BALSAMIC GLAZE  IS READY. AND SO ARE THE VEGGIES,  SO WE'LL TURN OFF ALL THE HEAT AND GRAB MY PLATE, AND I'M READY  TO PUT THIS TOGETHER. AND LET'S DO SOME VEGGIES  RIGHT ON THE PLATE. NICE. THEN JUST GRAB THIS LITTLE PIECE  OF FISH RIGHT HERE. RIGHT ON TOP. AND THEN... THE GLAZE  HAS REDUCED BEAUTIFULLY. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU  HOW PRETTY IT IS. AND RIGHT OVER THE FISH, AND YOU CAN EVEN PUT IT  OVER THE VEGGIES. OH, YEAH. THEN... GRAB A FORK AND YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A KNIFE,  'CAUSE SALMON'S SO BUTTERY. THERE WE GO--  A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING. IT'S HOT. MMM, MMM,  CRUNCHY VEGGIES, BUTTERY SALMON,  SWEET AND TANGY GLAZE. ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT, I'M GONNA MAKE TODD'S ALL-TIME  FAVORITE WEEKNIGHT DINNER-- BAKED POTATO WITH  SAUSAGE AND ARUGULA SAUCE. MEAT AND POTATOES  WITH A TWIST-- HEARTY, DELICIOUS, AND PERFECT  ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK. SO I'VE STARTED  ON MY BAKED POTATOES WITH SAUSAGE AND ARUGULA SAUCE. I ALREADY HAVE THE POTATOES  IN THE OVEN BAKING. NOW TIME TO START  ON THE SAUCE, SO WE'RE GONNA START  BY CHOPPING SOME ONION, AND THIS  IS A REALLY FAST SAUCE. I KNOW IT SOUNDS FUNNY  THAT WE WOULD HAVE A BAKED POTATO TOPPED  WITH A SAUCE ON TOP AS DINNER, BUT IT TRULY IS  A FAST, EASY DINNER. SO WE'RE GONNA START  BY CHOPPING THE ONION. ALL RIGHT,  SO WE'VE GOT OUR ONION. NOW LET'S START  HEATING UP THE PAN. WE'LL SAUTé IT  IN A LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL. SO LET'S GET  ALL OF THE ONION IN THERE, AND WE'RE GONNA ADD A LITTLE BIT  OF GARLIC, BUT NOT A LOT. AND I'M NOT  GONNA CHOP IT, EITHER. A LITTLE BIT OF SALT.  A LITTLE BIT OF PEPPER. LET'S CONTINUE  WITH THE GARLIC, SO WE'RE GONNA DO  TWO GARLIC CLOVES. SMASH AND PEEL THE GARLIC. I'M GONNA GARNISH THE POTATO  WITH A LITTLE BIT OF PARSLEY. YOU CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE TO, BUT WHY NOT  MAKE A WEEKNIGHT DINNER LOOK REALLY PRETTY? I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE SAUSAGE. SO WHAT I DID IS I JUST  GOT SOME SWEET PORK SAUSAGE. I HAD THEM TAKE THE MEAT  OUT OF THE CASING. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO  IS KIND OF CREATE A LITTLE SPACE  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PAN, SO YOU CAN START  BROWNING THE SAUSAGE. WE HAVE 1/2 A POUND  RIGHT THERE. AND JUST BREAK IT UP. SO THE SAUSAGE  IS COMPLETELY COOKED THROUGH-- NICE AND GOLDEN BROWN,  ONIONS ARE COOKED, SO IT'S TIME TO ADD  SOME TOMATO SAUCE. SO I'M GONNA ADD  1 1/2 CUPS OF TOMATO SAUCE, AND YOU CAN USE WHATEVER KIND OF JARRED TOMATO SAUCE YOU LIKE. YOU WANT TO WARM IT THROUGH. SEE HOW EASY THIS IS? AND NOW WE'RE GONNA ADD  SOME MASCARPONE CHEESE, JUST TO MAKE THIS  NICE AND CREAMY. SO 1/2 A CUP OF ROOM-TEMPERATURE MASCARPONE. IT WILL MELT  BEAUTIFULLY IN HERE. PERFECT. JUST GIVE IT A STIR,  AND IT'LL JUST START MELTING AND TURN IT INTO  A NICE, LIGHT, PINK SAUCE. TIME TO ADD SOME ARUGULA. SO I'VE GOT 3 CUPS OF ARUGULA, AND ARUGULA  IS JUST MILDLY SPICY. BUT I LIKE  A LITTLE BIT OF A GREEN, AND SO TO MAKE IT HEARTIER, I'M GONNA ADD 3 CUPS OF ARUGULA. AND I KNOW,  IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA  SHRINK DOWN AND WILT, JUST LIKE SPINACH DOES, AND YOU COULD ADD SPINACH  IF YOU WANTED TO. SO WE'LL JUST HEAT IT THROUGH, AND WE'RE ALSO GONNA ADD  SOME PARMESAN CHEESE. WE'VE GOT 1/2 A CUP  OF PARMESAN CHEESE, AND AGAIN, IF YOU BUY  THE PRE-GRATED STUFF, ON A WEEKNIGHT DINNER,  IT MAKES IT REALLY EASY. RIGHT IN THERE. YOU NEED THE COMBINATION  OF THE CREAMY MASCARPONE AND THE SORT OF SALTY, BUTTERY FLAVOR FROM THE PARMESAN CHEESE. I AM GONNA GRAB  THE BAKED POTATOES. THEY SHOULD BE DONE. THEY BAKED AT 350 FOR AN HOUR. SO I'M GONNA GRAB  ONE BAKED POTATO HERE, AND I'M JUST USING  MY OVEN MITTS, 'CAUSE SOMETIMES,  WHEN YOU OPEN IT UP, THERE'S A LOT OF STEAM. THERE WE GO, AND THERE  IS QUITE A BIT OF STEAM. NICE. OKAY. GET THOSE OFF... AND THEN I JUST  CUT THE TOP VERY GENTLY AND... OPEN UP THE BAKED POTATO. SO GRAB THE BAKED POTATO, AND YOU JUST SPOON THE SAUCE RIGHT INSIDE. PERFECT, THEN I TAKE  A LITTLE BIT OF THE PARSLEY AND JUST  SPRINKLE IT OVER THE TOP. IS THAT NOT BEAUTIFUL? ALL RIGHT, TODD AND JADE SHOULD BE READY FOR DINNER IN NO TIME, SO I'M GONNA FINISH UP  THE BAKED POTATOES, AND WE'RE GONNA EAT DINNER. - PAPA, I SAW YOU SURFING OUT THERE. - I KNOW. TELL ME ABOUT  YOUR SWIMMING TODAY. GUESS WHAT I DID?  WHAT? I CLOSED MY EYES. YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES,  AND YOU WENT UNDERWATER? HEY, DAD, HOW IS IT? GREAT. I'M NOT TALKING, AM I? I PUT  YOUR FAVORITE DINNER TOGETHER. OH, I SEE SOMEBODY  LIKES THE RED SAUCE. IS IT GOOD? OOH. AND SOMEBODY  LIKES SAUSAGE, TOO. AH. MMM. GOODY, GOODY, JADEY LIKES IT.  THAT'S SO AWESOME, JADE.
