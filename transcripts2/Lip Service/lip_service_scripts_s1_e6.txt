 Lip Service (2010â€“2012): Season 1, Episode 6 - Episode #1.6 - full transcript 
 Following his exposure at the party Jay gets dumped by Becky but there is good news for Ed, who gets his first novel published and for Tess, who wins a lead role in a stage play and gets a new girlfriend in electrician Fin. Frankie confronts Darren, learning that they are both the children of Alma Carter and an ultimate showdown with Cameron reveals that he is Frankie's father and it was considered that, given Alma's involvement with a crime, he and Carol should bring her up as their own. A confused Frankie sleeps with Cat but fails to win her away from Sam and finally abandons her plan to return to America, going to meet Alma instead.

 I knew there was something they weren't telling me. Who's Alma Carter? Aunt Carol sent her my photo album before she died. His name's Darren Morris. If they know each other, God knows what I'm walking into. I can't believe they're still here. I quite like having our names up there together. Back to school with Frankie, strolling down memory lane behind Sam's back. I was working! Would Sam see it like that? Guess what? I've got an agent! You have seen most of the casting directors in Scotland.

 I was scared that if you were a success, you wouldn't want to hang out with a loser like me. I love you. Tess... You do realise she's gay? It didn't stop you with Frankie, did it? We should go. I really liked you, Frankie. See you around. I love you. ~cine-lez~ pour ma petite toujours! Shagging Jay probably wasn't your best move. Shagging Jay wasn't the problem. It was people finding out. I really am sorry about Ed. I didn't know he'd blab. Right, let's go. I don't know about you, but I need my bed.

 Sam... Scoot over, it's freezing. Mm, thank you. That was some night last night. I wonder how Becky is. Mm. I hope for her sake she's still asleep. PHONE RINGS Mm, it's probably work. I said I'd go in later. Oh... no, it's worse. My landlady, she just won't leave it alone. You know, the last thing I need right now is to traipse around looking for another flat. Then maybe you don't need to. What do you mean? You could move in with me. Are you sure? If you don't want to... No, I... I didn't say that. Yeah, OK, you're on. BUZZER RINGS I'll get it then, shall I? It's Ed. Don't let him in. You just want me to leave him out there? I really can't face him right now. You'll get no complaints from me. All right, relax. He's gone. Jesus! Why won't he get the message? He's already rung me four times this morning. Because he lurves you. Yeah, well, whoever said honesty is the best policy needs shooting. I wonder what someone like Ed does fantasize about? I reckon it's domination. Were you hoping to add to the mess? No. Cat rang, she wants her boxes back. Why? Is she moving? Um, no. I think she's storing some stuff. She's asked Sam to move in with her. Wouldn't have taken her for the U haul type. Guess it can happen to the best of us. Anyway, things to do. SHE SLAMS HER BOWL DOWN # You said I Would be able to hear you breathe # Even though you're far away from me # So I put my hands up... # BUZZER RINGS Fuck! Hi. Thanks. Hey. Hi. I didn't think that you'd come. I can't stay long. What do you want to talk to me about? Is Sam moving in with you? Yeah. I asked her this morning. I don't want her to. I...I want to be with you. I love you. You have a funny way of showing it. Jay told me you didn't want me, I was upset. So you thought you'd play games? No, I... Why didn't you just talk to me? I'm talking to you now. Look, I have got to know how you feel about me. This is driving me nuts. I was all yours, Frankie. I would've done anything for you, but you threw it away. I wasn't ready then, but I am now. You're always ready until you get what you want and then you have to fuck it up. No! Not this time. What's changed? I've changed. Turning up at my work? Fucking Jay? Coming after me when I'm with someone else? It all looks pretty much the same to me. Look, come on. We... We never gave this a shot. Whose fault was that? DOOR CLOSES God, it is so cold out there. I've got us provisions. Listen, Ryder called. He's going to the pub for drinks tonight to celebrate his promotion. Do you want to go? I think it's time you met my friends. Yeah, OK. Hey, don't stress. They're going to love you as much as I do. I want you to fuck me. God, I love you. Ah, fuck it! Whisky. Bad morning? Yeah. Do you want to talk about it? No, just stop. I don't want this. Just relax. No. No, just stop. Just get off me! Darren? I need to talk to you. Yeah. Er...not here. Couldn't we just have chatted over a pint? Here. Your photo album. That's what you want, isn't it? Now can you just leave me alone? No, I want to know what the fuck's going on. Well, I can't help you. Why not? Is it my uncle? Has he threatened you? Look, I know you know him. I saw you with him. Oh, come on, for fuck's sake! Yes! Yes, all right! Yes, he could make life very difficult for her. For who? For Alma Carter? Look, I know she's my mother. I won't tell him that I've seen you, all right? Yeah, she's your mum. All right. And who are you? She's my mum, too. I'm sorry. It's not that we don't want to know you, we do. It's, it's... It's complicated. I don't understand. Why... why was I living with him when...? Was I adopted? Is that it? What, she didn't want me? No! No, no, it wasn't like that. No, it did her in losing you. Well, so why? I can't tell you any more! Why won't anybody tell me what's going on? I'm sorry. I was wondering if you'd seen Becky? 'Fraid not. I suppose you think I'm a total dick, too? It's OK. I already knew that. HE SIGHS God. I feel like crap. Hurting someone's so bloody horrible, you'd think it would stop you. Why do things seem like a good idea at the time? Fatal combination of alcohol and the horn. You reckon anything's happened to her? She'll be avoiding you. She probably needs to reset her boundaries. What?! I don't know. It's just something I heard on Dr Phil. SHE SIGHS Fancy some hair of the dog? Fuck, yeah! I could do with a drink. Yes! Ed, my man! Excellent to see you. Sorry I'm late. Has a waitress attended to your needs, so to speak? Not yet, no. Anyway, I won't keep you in suspense. I took the liberty of slipping your manuscript to a couple of friends of mine in the trade before I took you on and they are very excited. In fact, they're both clamouring to whack their big fat cheque books on the table and spunk a wodge of cash in your direction. They want to publish my book? They certainly do. They're that excited that I wouldn't be surprised if soon we're talking film rights, foreign sales... I'll tell you what else it means. Snatch. Loads of it. I've heard these sci-fi groupies would suck off their own granddad if he was an extra in Star Trek. Anyway, the gents calls. Phone your friends, boast. Let the schadenfreude commence. Not often you get a day like this. Oh, Jesus! I'm going to die of hyperthermia, or is it frostbite? What do people die of? Moaning? At least you'll avoid the terrible conversation with Becky. Oh, thank you. PHONE RINGS I'd managed to forget about that for 30 seconds there. Er, what's my agent doing calling on a Saturday? Hello? What, today? Um, yeah, no, no, that's great! Um, what time? Three o'clock. OK, yeah, I can be there. OK. All right, bye. This is brilliant! Some actress has dropped out of Uncle Vanya at The Tron and they need to audition a new Sonia today. Guess I won't be getting pissed. Come on. It'll be good for you. I'll keep you company, but that's it. Right, let's go. Um, we've got a lift. Keeps you fit. If I wanted to be fit I wouldn't be holding three bottles of wine. Ah, it's a shame, they don't make these cage elevators any more. Detailing on the metalwork's great. I still can't believe you're an architect. Are you sure you didn't buy your degree off the internet? Shut it! POWER FAILS Shit, you don't think it's broken do you? Nah, it's probably just conked out for a second. Is that the technical term? What the... Ah! Fuck. I don't believe this. After a stupendous birthday bash, I'm now going to miss my audition cos I'm stuck in a lift! Don't go all Nostradamus on me, I'm sure help'll be here in a minute. (Ah, fuck.) I am sick of you lying to me. I want you to tell me the truth. I'm with friends, Francesca, I haven't got time for this. Do you honestly think I'm going to go away and forget about this? Yes! What? Dig any deeper, you'll hurt yourself. Try to find her, I'll hurt her too. So if you care about your mother at all, let it drop. It's amazing, Ed... My daft wee brother with a book deal? You realise you're making me look bad. Mum's going to be boasting her head off now. Just shove it here. Come on, you can't let this thing with Tess ruin your big day. D'you think she'll ever speak to me again? Of course, she just needs to be weird and angry for a while. I know everyone thinks I'm an idiot, but I couldn't help it. She's my best friend. No-one gets me like Tess does. It's OK, Ed. I fell in love with my best friend, remember. She told me she loved me today. She wants to be with me. You're not going to...? What does it look like? I just... feel bad. I wasn't very nice to her. Good. Just because I don't want to be with her doesn't mean I can't be her friend. I love Sam, she's moving in with me. Then stay away from Frankie. The last thing you need is her messing up your life again. I mean it, Cat. This is what she does, she sucks you in and fucks you over. Don't let her. OK, OK, I heard you. I need a tea break. Want some? No, I'm going to get off. See if I can find Tess. Come here. Say hi to Sam for me. You're really lucky to have someone like her, you know. 'Hi, this is Cat. Leave me a message.' Great, still no signal. Becky's going to think I don't give a shit. Well, I'm looking at my only chance a lead going up in smoke. Sod it, give me that. Well, at least Ed can't ring me any more... Every cloud. I get why I'm pissed off with him but I don't get why you are. Isn't it obvious? I thought he was my friend and all this time he's been lusting after me. You're just punishing him because he fancies you and you think that makes him a loser. If you're so wise, how come you shagged Frankie? I dunno... I dunno! We were pissed, she was there. I'm not in love with her if that's what you think. I thought maybe you wanted a way out with Becky. No... Maybe you're not ready to settle down, you just want to be, which is different. Listen, if every woman waited for a bloke to be ready no-one would ever have a relationship, all right? I love Becky. And if I ever get out of here, I intend on telling her that. What are you doing? What does it look like? If we don't do something we're going to be stuck in here all night! BEEPING 'Hey Cat, I'm not going to try and change your mind.' 'I just really need to talk to you. 'I'll be at the cafe in an hour. Let me know if you can make it.' Hello! Give it up, Jay, there's no-one around. I can't believe this, my relationship's going down the pan because of faulty technology. Not exclusively, your dick helped. Oh, don't... DOOR SLAMS > Thank fuck for that, it's Ed. Shh, don't say anything! I don't want to talk to him. What, are you nuts? Ed! Ed! Tess and I are stuck. Can you open that catch and pull the door open? Tess... Listen, Jay, I'm really sorry about last night. Don't apologise, Ed. It's him who can't keep his pants on. Why are you sticking up for him? You were ignoring him. I know you're pissed off with me, you've been avoiding my calls. Can we not talk about it now, I've got audition. I'm not letting you out until it's sorted. You are joking, aren't you? No, I mean it. She won't listen to me otherwise. Tess, I'm sorry. It was a mistake, I shouldn't have said anything, I know you don't want to be with me, I just want things to go back to the way they were. Well, how can they? Everything's changed. No, it hasn't. You're still my best mate. I don't know what I'll do without you, Tess. Who's going to watch crap daytime quiz shows with me or... or laugh at fat people falling over on YouTube? I always felt this way and it didn't make a difference before, did it? He has got a point. Wh... What? I'm just saying! All blokes want to fuck every girl they meet, he's just taken it a bit further. That's not true. You haven't thought about me like that. How do you know? Oh, God! Jay, you're really not helping! Oh, well I'm sorry, Ed, but I need to get out to sort out the mess with Becky that you got me in to. So will you get a fucking shift on and kiss and make up! Maybe not kiss, but... OK, OK, we can be mates, as long as we never have to talk about it again. Believe me, I really don't want to. Yeah! Great, now will you please open the bloody door? Ow! Um, I've got to go and change. I've got to be at The Tron in 20 minutes. I've got the car, I can give you a lift if you want? Amazing. If you don't mind... Ed, try not grope her in the back seat. I am really happy for you about your book, you know. Thanks. Hopefully some of your luck'll rub off on me. You should have a bit of confidence. Yes. Be yourself and you'll be great. OK. Do my eyes still look weird? No worse than usual. Listen, I'm sorry I was a twat last night. It's OK. I'm sorry things went a bit tits up for a while. But I'm glad I said it. I think sometimes it's good just to be honest, then you can make changes and move on. Now go and blow them away. OK! So Tess, I might have an old CV, but it says the last thing you did was a year ago, Casualty. Yeah? Yeah. You been up to anything recently? Yeah, yeah. Um, I've been over in LA for the pilot season. Right. Anything good? Yeah, um... this love story about a research scientist and an alien on a space station. I'm waiting to hear. Who's your agent? My agent? In LA? Oh, um... Actually, um... Actually, er... this is rubbish. I haven't been in LA. I've... I've been temping and watching daytime telly as usual. Maybe I should just throw in the towel, but I... I don't want to, because... I really... I really love acting. OK. Wow, you've been busy. I think you've done enough packing. Do you fancy the cinema before we go for drinks? Actually, Frankie just rang. She wants to meet me for a coffee. I think she feels bad, wants to talk to someone. And that has to be you, does it? I don't want to shut her out just because she fucked up. Look, If you don't want me to go... No. No, you should, she's your mate. It's the right thing to do. You're amazing, you know that. Yeah. Just make sure you're back by six. Everyone's really excited about meeting you and I don't want to be late. One day it will come and it will wrap itself around us with warmth and light, and take us into a very deep and rolling peace. But till it does, till it does, we work. Um... Do you... Shall I do it again? No. That was great. Really great. Your agent's been through the schedule, yeah? Uh-hum. And judging by what you said earlier, you're free, yes? Yes. Very. OK. Well, we'll be in touch. Great, thank you. Thank you. Bye. Am I Eleanor? I'll say this for you, you don't give up easily. Look...I know I'm not Francesca Alan. Why are you in this picture? I didn't come to live with you till I was three. Where did you get this? Oh, you know Darren. I saw you warn him off. I broke into his house and I stole it. Like mother, like daughter. How do you know my mother? Aunt Carol was dying and she wanted me to know. How do you know my mother? Can you just tell me how you know her? She was a barmaid at my local. I was working away from home, staying in digs. Everyone wanted Alma Carter. When she turned her attention on me, I was lost. I'd known her a few months when she knocked on my door late, crying, blood all over her blouse. They'd done a robbery, passerby had stumbled in. Her mate glassed him in the neck. He bled to death. They ran off. I should have let her go then but... she told me she was pregnant with you. You're... ..you're my father? And three years later she says she's leaving me. But I still had her blouse, covered in that poor bloke's blood. I couldn't let her have you, not my daughter. All these years you've been lying to me? We thought it was better you didn't know. When Robert and Lizzie's car went off the road your cousin died... ..we gave you her name. You let me believe that they were my parents. I loved Carol, I'd hurt her enough. Alma was a mistake! Don't go getting all sentimental. She could have kept you, but she knew I'd have gone to the police. Alma was my mother! She had a choice. She wept and wailed but when it came down to it, she chose to save her own skin. She... she could have loved me. She didn't know the meaning of the word. She was trouble, caused a lot of pain. She should never have happened and neither should you. Shit. Come on... 'You have one new message.' 'Hey, Frankie. Just wondering where you are, it's quarter past.' MOBILE RINGS 'Hi, this is Cat. Leave me a message.' KNOCK ON DOOR Hi. Is Cat here? I thought you were going to meet her earlier? I was late. Yeah, never mind. I'll catch her later. Why do you want her? Um, we... we were just going to chat. That's not what I meant. Cat's happy, we're happy. Now... if you think you can make her as happy as I do, then go ahead, mess it up for us. But personally... I think she deserves better than a total fuck up, don't you? MUSIC PLAYS, PEOPLE CHATTER Frankie, are you OK? Are you crying? Frankie? Sh... Sh... PHONE RINGS Hello? I got it? Ah! Yeah, yeah, I'll call you on Monday. OK, great. Thanks. Bye! Ahhhh... BUZZER SOUNDS Hi. Hi. Sorry to bother you but apparently a parcel for me was delivered here by mistake? I...I don't think so. Is that it, there? Oh! Right, that one. Yeah, um... Sorry about that. Here you go. You've opened it. Oh, no, that wasn't me. Um... it was, um, probably my cousin. He's staying here at the moment. He's a bit eccentric, he's got no inhibitions. He made this mess. I think he's taken it. Has he?! Ah. Er, yeah, he-he probably has. Damn it. He loves DIY. Mm. I'm not sure where he'd have put it. I'll ask him when he gets back. Sorry. No, don't worry about it. It's been one of those days. Oh, why? The weather's making the electrics go tits up everywhere. My workmate's off ill, so I've got a long night ahead of me, alone, doing two people's work. Well, um... I could...come with you if you like. That's a really kind offer. Are you sure? Yeah, why not, be interesting. OK, you're on. Oh, wow. This is brilliant! I've always wanted to check out buildings when no-one around. You must see some really interesting places. Don't you ever just want to, like, snoop through people's stuff? No, more than my job's worth. Anyway, most people aren't that interesting. With the odd exception. So, um, you must have had to train for ages to know what you're doing? No, I went to art school... Uh? Yeah, I did silver-smithing and jewellery. So, are you just busking it or are we likely to get blown up? Nah, I did an NVQ, too. You should, um, show me your art sometime. Well, I did make this. Oh, my God, that's amazing! Take it. Really? Mm. I can make another one. Thanks. It's...it's so nice. # I'm too sexy for my shirt... # Sorry, I only changed it this morning. I thought it would be funny. Oh, it's my friend, Ed. He probably wants to know how my audition went. You're an actress? Yeah, um... I just got the lead in the play at The Tron. No? Yeah. Sorry, it probably sounds like I'm boasting. I suppose I am, really. It's just usually I'm lucky if I get three lines. Congratulations! Thanks. Ah! Wanna celebrate? Cat? Cat? Brrr! I've been calling you. I turned my phone off. If you're looking for Becky, she's not dead, I saw her this morning, but if she did walk in front of a bus it'd hardly be surprising. Oh, thanks, like I don't feel bad enough already. Not so bad it actually stopped you. You can be really judgemental. I remember you did the dirty on a girlfriend when you got together with Frankie. Once, Jay, one affair. It's a miracle you can get to the corner shop without shagging someone. Don't fucking exaggerate, I've only slept with Frankie. Maybe you should get together! Mm, well that's unlikely seeing as she's in love with you. Right(!) She loves me so much that she asked to meet me today and then stood me up. She was with her uncle. They had a huge row. It turns out he's not her uncle, he's her dad. She was in a bad way, so you probably just slipped her mind, you know? Anyway, she's decided to fly back to New York tonight, but she asked me to give you that. Oh... OK, so that's one seat tonight to JFK? OK. No, no, I'll pick the ticket up at the airport. Thanks. Bye. Hey. Hey. Um, I don't want to hassle you but I said we'd be there in the next 20 minutes. Sorry, I ran in to Jay. We had a row. Are you OK? Yeah. I just don't want to talk about it now. Did you see Frankie? She didn't turn up. Look, I need to get changed, can we talk on the way? Yeah, sure. I'm ready when you are. Ed just rang, he's in a complete state about Tess. I've never heard him like this. I'm sorry but I'm going to have to go over there. Do you want me to come with you? No, I think it's better if I go by myself. You go to the pub and I'll meet you all there later, OK? Give Ed my love. Cat, don't be long. I love you, I can't wait to show you off. Are you really going to leave? I think if I had to come here every day I'd probably throw myself off. Me too. Are you cold? Oh, no, now you'll be cold! Nah, I don't feel it much. Thanks. I'm curious, was your electrics really out the other day? Oh, yeah. God, sorry about that, that was really weird. That's a shame. I was hoping that after you'd been checking me out from your window all this time that you might've wanted to ask me out. Yeah, that... That too. I used to fantasise about what it would be like to have a mum. And all the time I did. He didn't even want me and he robbed me of that. You still have a mother, Frankie. You could see her. She gave me up. She must've known what he was like. You've only heard his side. Talk to her. If you don't like what she has to say, walk away. If I want to get that plane I've got...I've got to leave now. What are you going to do? I'm going to stay. See her. Did you get my present? Yeah. Thank you. How did you get it? It wasn't easy. I should never have run away from you. Why did you? I was scared. I didn't think that I deserved you. Panicked. I was stupid. I thought... if you knew me that well and you could still walk away, there must be something really wrong with me. There's nothing wrong with you. I love you, Cat. I always have. 'Hi, this is Cat. Leave me a message.' Do you reckon she's all right? Yeah, she's with her brother and he's having a really hard time. I think that's probably why she's not answering her phone. It's fine. OK. It's fine. I need to go. She'll be wondering where I am. Do you love her? Do you still love me? I went to the estate agent's today, right. Three bedrooms, roof terrace. It's got... Jay, just stop, please. Cos a place together is just the start. Do you want marriage? Kids? A family? Cos that's what I want. Can you really tell me it's what you want? That's what I thought. I was starting to really worry about you. Everyone, this is my better half. This is Cat. Hey, I'm Ryder. Hi. I'm the poor bastard that she's been banging on to about how great you are. Hey, you look like you could do with a glass of wine. Thought I'd see what the view looked from the other side. Is that your flatmate? Mm. Did she steal my handsaw? Uh-huh. Well, you didn't think I'd believe that crap about your eccentric cousin, did you? We have coffee, croissants. We even have the newspaper. Am I a hero, or what? I thought maybe today I'd put up those shelves you wanted. Mark my arrival, like planting a tree. Yeah. OK. Darren, it's Frankie. # Thinking about tomorrow # Tired from all the time I spared # On what I still believe in # When none of my talk Ever seems to get me anywhere # Yeah, these habits are so hard to break # And they're most easy to make # These habits are so hard to break # And they're so easy to make # So easy, yeah # So long # Night-night friends, so long # So long # Will it ever happen again? # You know that I've been waiting for you # I've been created for you # So long # You know that I've been fading from you # Nothing could save me from you # So long # Tired, but I ain't dreamin' # Falling into solid earth # On why I must be leavin' # Cos one of these days # I'm gonna pull out all my hair # Yeah these habits are so hard to break # And the most easy to make...# ~cine-lez~ pour ma petite toujours!
