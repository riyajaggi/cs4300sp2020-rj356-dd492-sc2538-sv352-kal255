 Come on, Bailey! [narrator] The babies are having fun playing firetruck. But where's Kip? [laughs] Peek-a-pop! I peek-a-popped you! -I put out this fire... -Oh, they're playing firetruck. Huh. I don't feel like playing that game. Um, hey, hey, ca-ca-can we play a different game? -No, we like this game. -No, firetruck's fun. I never get to choose. Oh! Hey! Oh, boy! Clickety Clock is here! Hey, hey, big kids, can you see what time it is? [big kids] Time to play! No more firetruck! Phew! Hey, hey, guys! It-- It's time to play inside! [narrator] Yes, it's time for the babies to play in the playroom. And there's a surprise for them there. -Let's go! -Surprise! -Come on, Kip! -Oh, I love surprises! [chuckles] -Wow! -Cool! That's a big, big box. Why's it here? [narrator] We had a delivery today, and it came in this box. Oh, and now we can play with it! Yes! Oh, boxes are so fun to play with! -Yeah! -We can pretend it's a vehicle! Oh, firetruck! Firetruck! Oh, uh, oh, we already played that. Um, um, c-c-can I choose the game? Oh, sure, Kip. Um, can you think of a vehicle for pretend? Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course! Oh, you guys are gonna love this! Okay, um, well... Uh, it's coming, it's coming. Ah, uh, wait! Uh, well, how about if we put the...? While we're waiting, let's pretend this box is a... sailboat! [Lulu] Yes! Okay. We can turn the box over, and use a blanket for a sail. Um, th-tha-tha-that sounds hard. Oh, we can do it! If we work together, we can do it! -[drum roll] -We can do it! Yes, we can! We can do it! Yes, we can! We can do it! Yes, we can! [Franny] We can do it! [all] Yes, we can! I told you we could do it! Now let's pretend you guys are on an island over there. And I'm captain of the sailboat sailing by, okay? Ahoy! Ahoy, landlubbers! Uh, I'm still thinking about other vehicles. Well, while you're thinking... [gasps] Watch out for that big wave! [all] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! And now say hi to the big whale! [Bailey and Lulu] Hi, whale! Uh, I don't see a whale. We're pretending! -You could be the whale! -Oh, right. [laughs] Okay. Hi! I'm a nice whale! Oh, looks like I have to go and have fun swimming! Bye! Okay, are we done playing sailboat now? Well, do you have an idea for another vehicle? [chuckles] Yes! Yes! Okay, uh, no. Oh, well, I have an idea. Um, what if we turned this box into an airplane? We could make wings out of the sides of the box, and glue them on. -Hmm. That sounds hard. -[Lulu] Yeah! We can do it! -Yes, we can! -[Franny] Come on! [imitating engine] [Bailey] Zoom, zoom! Bbbbrrrrr! [chuckles] I like airplanes because they fly through the sky! Zoom! Oh, hi, little birdies! Oh, uh, uh, um... [both tweeting] Yeah! Hey, hey, Kip, are you gonna be a birdie too? Uh, no. I'm a little busy... thinking. Vehicle, vehicle. Okay! Mee-owww! Zoom! Oh, watch out, little birdies! Time to land now. [both tweeting] [imitates engine] [chuckles] Nice landing! [chuckles] Thank you! Fun. Box fun! Yep, it sure is fun! This box was a sailboat and then an airplane. Oh, now what vehicle should we turn the box into? [gasps] Firetruck! Oh, b-b-b-but it's still my turn to choose! Kip's right, so what vehicle do you choose? Well, I-I can't think of a vehicle. Oh, well, that's okay, Kip. Yeah. No sad, Kippie. Something will pop into your head. -Yeah. -Oh, I hope so. I've been thinking so hard. Hey! It's the whatsit toy! Yeah! The whatsit toy always has what you need!

What that? It's a telescope! You see, you can look through it, and see things that are far, far away, like, oh, the moon. And, and the planets in outer space! That's cool. Space! Oh, I'd love to go to space someday. [gasps] I got it! I choose to pretend we're going to outer space! That sounds like fun, Kip. Uh, thanks, Bailey. Great idea! What vehicle takes you to outer space? Oh, yeah, uh... Oh, I don't know the word for that vehicle. Oh, well, don't worry. We can learn the word. Let's call Word Wally! -[all three] Word Wally! -[trumpets] -Where he is? -Whoa. [all] There he is! Word Wally! Come on! Let's go, go, go! [laughing] [Kip] Hi, Word Wally!

Vrooom! [laughing] Oh, hey, that, that's the vehicle that takes you to outer space. What's it called? [drum roll] [big kids] Rocket. [gasps] A rocket! Yeah! That's the one! Oh, you did it, Kip!
