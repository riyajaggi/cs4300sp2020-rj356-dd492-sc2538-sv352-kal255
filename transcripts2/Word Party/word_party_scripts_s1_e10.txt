 And you stretch with us. Okay. First, you stretch your legs. [all] Kick, kick, kick, kick. Stretch, stretch, stretch, yeah, yeah... Now, our wiggly arms. [all] Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle... Now our ears! [laughing] Okay, now, everything! [murmuring] [sighing] Okay, all stretched? [laughing] -Shake, shake, shake... -Yeah! [all] Oh! Oh, boy, it's Clickety Clock! What time is it, big kids? [drum roll] [big kids] Time to play! [cheering] [narrator] The babies are going to the playroom, and there's a surprise for them there. Ooh, a surprise? I love surprises. Oh! I-I hope it's a... it's a castle made out of ice cream! Yeah! I know... A snowball that you can live in. Wow! Or, or... maybe we, we should just go see what it is. -Oh, good idea! -Yeah! Okay, let's go! -Yeah! -[Kip] Come on! [gasping] What's that? [narrator] The babies are surprised to see this egg. -Yeah. Very, very surprised! -[Kip] Yeah. [narrator] This egg is going to hatch soon, and when it opens up, a new friend will come out. Ooh, that is surprising! [narrator] But you have to be careful because eggs can break. Oh, we'll be careful. [laughs] Yip, yip, yay! A new friend for me! And for you, and you, and you! And you, and you, and you! Oh, I feel... I feel very... [gasps] excited! I feel very excited! -[trumpets] -[all] Yeah, excited! [Kip] Excited! I feel excited! Excited! Excited! Excited! Excited! [shouts] Stop! Stop! You're making the egg shake. It could fall. It could break! [narrator] Franny is right. We need to take good care of our egg until it hatches. Yes, and jumping around isn't taking good care of our egg. Are you okay, little egg? Sorry, egg. Um, I'm sorry, Franny. Oh, that's okay. I'm just worried we won't take good care of this sweet little egg. Oh, well, now I'm worried. Yeah, me too. And me, me. Oh. [narrator] Don't worry. You will do a good job taking care of our egg. Thanks! So, what could we do for our egg right now? [gasps] Oh! I have an idea! Oh, I-I-I bet my new egg friend would like to hear pretty music! -Yeah! -That's, that's a good idea, Kip. [Kip clears throat] ♪ La, la, la, la-la, la, la la ♪ Oh! Wait a second! Oh, I'm thinking if I play loud music, then maybe my new friend inside this egg will wake up and hatch right now! [imitates electric guitar] Kip, no! That's... that's too loud for a little egg. Loud. I think the egg will hatch when it's ready to hatch, Kip. Not before. But, ugh, but it's taking so much time! [Kip gasps] Oh, big kids, we need your help. Can you tell us what time it is? [drum roll] [big kids] Time to eat! [narrator] That's right. It's time for the babies to go to the kitchen and have a snack. -Yay! -Yum, yum. Okay. Careful. Let's go slowly, like teeny, tiny turtles. [Kip] Oh, okay. ♪ Teeny, tiny turtles ♪ ♪ Going real slow ♪ ♪ Teeny, tiny turtles ♪ Come! Come! ♪ Teeny, tiny turtles ♪ [Kip] Bailey! [laughing] Bottle! [chuckles] Oh, bottle time! Yum, yum! Hmm, if we need bottles, I wonder what our egg needs. Ooh! A hug? Oh, careful, Bailey. Oh, yeah. Ah, this? Um, I don't think that will work, Lulu. This egg needs to hatch. Um, but, Kip, maybe our egg is not ready to hatch. But... but I'm ready. Hmm. Knock, knock. Time to come out! Kip, don't... Don't "knock, knock" on our egg. Why not? Ah... knock, knock. [shouts] Come out now! Kip wants to meet you! Oh, too loud, Kip. But... but... I want to meet my new friend now. I feel... I feel... Uh, flipper-snapper. No, that's not right. Uh, I-I feel flobber-flibber. No, that's not it. I feel... I feel... I don't know what I feel, but... but this feeling is hard! Wait, Kip. You're shaking the egg! Let's call Word Wally. Yeah! He'll help you learn the word for what you're feeling. Come on, Kip. [all three] Word Wally! [trumpets] [Franny] Oh, I hear him! There he is! Word Wally, wait! -[Bailey] Come on, Word Wally! -Okay, come on. Let's go, go, go. -[Lulu] Here I come! -Maybe Word Wally will help. [laughing] [narrator] The babies are here to learn the words for the feelings they're having. Yeah. Feelings. Ugh. I'm really... Uh, d'oh! ...feeling something about the egg not hatching. And you can help teach us! Let's start! Oh, that's what we were feeling when we first saw the egg! What's the word for that feeling, big kids? [drum roll] [big kids] Surprised! [babies] Surprised. Huh, okay. That's what I was feeling about taking care of our egg. What's that? [drum roll] [big kids] Worried. [babies] Yeah, worried. Hmm, okay. Oh, that's the good feeling we have about having a new friend. What's that feeling, big kids? [drum roll] [big kids] Excited! [babies] Yeah! Excited! Yeah! Oh, oh, that's the bad feeling I have because our egg won't hatch now. What's the word for that? [drum roll] [big kids] Frustrated. Frusta... frusta-poo? Frusta-pra? What? H-h-how do you say it? [big kids] Frustrated! Oh, uh, I'm feeling... frust-ra-ted. [gasps] I think I said it! Frustrated! Ah, great job, Kip! Now we have a word party! [cheering] [all] Word party!
