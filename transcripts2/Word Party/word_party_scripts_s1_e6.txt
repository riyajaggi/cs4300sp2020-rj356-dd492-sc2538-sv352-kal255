[thud] [Franny] Born in a box of crayons at the end of the rainbow. -[yells] -In a place with lots of paint. Buussh! Buussh! Buussh! Here comes... the color monster! [roars] [laughing] Oh, no! It's the color monster! -Oh, whatever will we do? -Yeah! Run! Run! -Okay! Yeah! -Run! Let's run! Let's run! [Kip] Oh, the color monster's fun. Oh, look out! Look out! Only colors can save us now! But which color? I am the color monster! Only the color, uh... brown can stop me! [roars] Help us, big kids! We need something brown to stop the color monster. Is this brown? [big kids] No! -[roars] -Ooh! [Lulu chuckles] This brown? [big kids] No! -[chuckles] -[roars] Big kids, is, is this brown? [big kids] Yes! Take that, color monster! Bibibear is brown! -[chuckles] -[gasps] No, not brown! How did you know that could stop me? [Kip giggles] Oh, that's right! I just told you! [laughing] You did it, Kippie! You stopped the color monster! [cheering] [laughing] [roars] The color monster is back and bigger than ever! [roars] [laughing] Oh, everybody, run! Only the color white can stop me! -[roars] -Maybe this will work. [chuckles] White ball! Take that, color monster! -That ball is orange! -Oh! Orange does nothing to the color monster! [chuckles] Oh, boy! Only the color white can stop me! [roars] Oh, no! The color white! Who will save us? -Oh, no! -[roars] Oh, um, Franny, Franny, you're a little too loud. And scary. What? That's not Franny! That's the color monster! [roars] Paper! White! Color monster. Ah! White! The only color that... can... stop... me! Way to go, Lulu! -Thanks for saving us, Lulu! -Okay. [sighs] Now that that's done, what should we play next? -Um, I was thinking-- -[roars] Oh. Oh, no, not again. The only color that can stop me now is... violet! Oh, no! Violet! -Violet! -Violet? Violet. Vio... Hold on, wait. Violet? Uh, uh, freeze, freeze. T-t-time out, color monster! What's wrong? We don't know violet. Hmm, maybe we need to learn more words for colors. Oh, yeah, yeah! We should stop playing color monster and call Word Wally. -[gasps] -[chuckles] -[all three] Word Wally! -[trumpets] -Oh, there he goes! -I see him! Word Wally! [Kip] There he is! [Lulu] Hi, Word Wally! [narrator] The babies are here to learn words for different colors. Yes! And you will help teach us! Let's start! Big kids, what color is that? [drum roll] [big kids] Brown. [gasps] Just like Bibibear! Yeah! Ooh, pretty! What color, big kids? [drum roll] [big kids] Orange. Mmm! I love to eat oranges! [laughing] Now, what color is that, big kids? [drum roll] [big kids] White. White! Like paper! -Yeah. -Yeah. Oh, well, I don't know that color. I know that color. Do you know the word for that color, big kids? [drum roll] [big kids] Violet. -Oh! That's violet! -Violet! Wow! That looks like purple! You're right, Kip. Violet is a kind of purple. So, if we find something violet, will we stop the color monster game? Sure!

Franny, it's just that you're a little bit scary when you're the color monster. Bailey, I'm sorry. You should have told me. Yeah, but everyone was having fun, so I didn't want to stop your game. It's not fun unless we're all having fun together. It's okay, Bail-Bail. No monster, see? Just Wanny. Don't worry, we won't play any more monster games. Well, I didn't say we shouldn't play anymore. Just maybe less big loud roars. Sure thing. -[chuckles] -Aw. [gasps] Well, then I have something for you, color monster. -[chuckles] -Oh, what is it? A violet hat! Oh, no! Violet! You got me!
