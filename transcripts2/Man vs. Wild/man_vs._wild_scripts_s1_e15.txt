 Man vs. Wild (2006â€“2020): Season 1, Episode 15 - Scotland - full transcript 
 In Scotland's Cairngorm National Park, tourists come to walk in the glens or climb the mountains, but few realize the park is classified as an Arctic landscape -- and an average of 30 tourists die here every year. Host Bear Grylls shows how to navigate the region using ice formations and moss growth, and tests snow slopes for avalanche potential. He uses moss to purify water and skins a red deer for shelter. For food, he traps and cooks a rabbit. Bear crosses deep marshes that can swallow a man and uses fallen trees to cross ravines.

 I'M BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES. I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN THE REMOTE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS. MILLIONS COME HERE TO WITNESS THIS ANCIENT AND WILD LAND. BUT EACH YEAR, 60 PEOPLE NEED RESCUING. I'M GONNA SHARE THE SKILLS NEEDED TO SURVIVE HERE. I'M IN THE MOST NORTHERLY POINT IN THE U.K., IN THE REMOTE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS. THIS IS CLASSIC FISHING, CLIMBING, AND HIKING COUNTRY.

 THERE'S ALMOST 1,500 SQUARE MILES OF SPECTACULAR RIVERS, PEAKS, VALLEYS, AND HUGE MOORS. AND MOST OF IT IS UNTOUCHED SINCE THE MIDDLE AGES. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME HERE. I'M HEADING INTO A MOUNTAIN RANGE THAT ATTRACTS OVER HALF A MILLION TOURISTS EVERY YEAR. THIS AREA GETS THE MOST EXTREME WEATHER OF ANYWHERE IN THE U.K., AND LAST YEAR, SEVEN PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES HERE. THE WINTER STORMS THAT CAN ROLL IN HERE FROM THE ATLANTIC CAN BRING WITH THEM WINDS OF UP TO 170 MILES AN HOUR. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF HURRICANE LEVEL 5, AND WITH THOSE CAN COME TREACHEROUS SUBZERO TEMPERATURES.

 IF NEEDED, I'LL BE GETTING SOME ASSISTANCE FROM LOCAL EXPERTS, AND A CAMERA CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. THE LOW CLOUDS ARE FORCING US TO FLY ONLY 2,500 FEET ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS. MUCH LOWER, AND THE JUMP COULD BE FATAL. I USUALLY PARACHUTE AT 10,000 FEET OR MORE. AT THIS HEIGHT, THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR. I'VE LANDED IN PRETTY HORRENDOUS CONDITIONS. BUT I'M DOWN, AT LEAST. I'M 4,000 FEET HIGH ON A MOUNTAIN PLATEAU, BUT THE SUDDEN CLOUD COVER IS SO THICK, I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE SUN TO WORK OUT WHICH WAY I'M FACING. THIS IS THE REALITY OF WEATHER IN SCOTLAND. YOU KNOW, IT CAN CHANGE SO FAST. YOU SEE ALL OF THIS MIST. IT'S REALLY MAKING VISIBILITY MINIMAL. EVEN THOUGH I CAN'T SEE MORE THAN 30 FEET IN ANY DIRECTION, I CAN STILL FIGURE OUT WHICH WAY I NEED TO GO. AS I HEAD OFF INTO THE MIST, A FREEZING BLIZZARD CLOSES IN AROUND ME. THE SNOW IS NOW BLASTING IN ALL DIRECTIONS. IT'S HARD TO FEEL WHERE THE WIND IS COMING FROM, BUT THE ICE ON THE ROCKS SHOWS ME THE WIND DIRECTION. SEE, DOWN HERE, THESE ICE PARTICLES, THESE ARE REALLY HELPING ME MAINTAIN MY DIRECTION. AND THIS WIND NOW IN THESE HIGH PLATEAUS HAS REALLY PICKED UP. IT WOULD BE SO EASY TO LOSE MY BEARINGS. WHAT THESE LITTLE THINGS ARE, THEY'RE CALLED RIME ICE. WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS MOISTURE HITS THE ROCKS AND THEN FREEZES. IT STARTS TO GROW THESE PARTICLES OUT TOWARDS THE WIND. REALLY, THESE ARE LIKE REVERSE FLAGS, AND IT'S JUST ANOTHER INDICATOR OF WHERE THIS WIND IS COMING FROM. I'VE GOT TO KEEP MY HEAD DOWN OUT OF THIS FREEZING WIND. MY FACE IS GOING NUMB. THIS WIND NOW IS JUST GETTING SUPERSTRONG. AND IF IT BUILDS ANY MORE, REALLY, I'M JUST STRUGGLING EVEN JUST TO STAND UP. THIS WIND'S NOW GONE NOTICEABLY STRONGER. AND OFTEN WHAT HAPPENS, WHEN THE WIND HITS DEEP SLOPES OR CLIFFS, THE WIND GETS COMPRESSED AND THEN ACCELERATES. SO, THIS IS TELLING ME I MIGHT WELL BE GETTING CLOSE TO SOME SLOPES LIKE THAT, THE FACT THAT IT'S SUDDENLY SO MUCH STRONGER. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION, YOU HAVE TO TAKE REAL CARE WHERE YOU TREAD. A STEEP SLOPE MIXED WITH ALL THIS WIND AND SNOW IS A DEADLY COMBINATION. AND I'M WALKING STRAIGHT INTO AN AVALANCHE ZONE. THE ANGLE OF THIS SLOPE IS BETWEEN 30 AND 40 DEGREES, AND THAT'S CLASSIC AVALANCHE ANGLE. WHEN IT'S WINDY LIKE THIS, THERE'S A REAL DANGER OF WINDSLAB AVALANCHE, AND WINDSLAB IS THE MOST COMMON SORT OF AVALANCHE IN SCOTLAND JUST BECAUSE OF HOW WINDY IT IS. AND IT TAKES VERY LITTLE TO TRIGGER AN AVALANCHE. AND ON FACES LIKE THIS, THERE IS A WAY TO WORK OUT HOW AVALANCHE-PRONE IT IS. AND WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS DIG AN AVALANCHE PIT. THIS WILL SHOW YOU HOW STABLE THE SNOWPACK IS. LOOK, IF I GET ACROSS TO -- ACROSS TO AN AREA LIKE THIS, ALL I NEED TO DO IS DIG DOWN... THROUGH THE SOFT SNOW UNTIL I GET TO THE BOTTOM. THERE YOU GO -- YOU SEE HARD, COMPACT SNOW UNDERNEATH. AND THEN DIG DOWN THE SIDE TO GET THROUGH THE FRESH SNOW TO THIS ICY STUFF. AND THEN ACROSS -- ACROSS HERE. AND THEN WHAT I CAN DO... IS PULL LIKE THIS. AND IF THAT'S WELL-BONDED, IT'S NOT GONNA MOVE. IF IT'S WEAK, THOUGH, ALL OF THIS SLAB WILL JUST SLIDE DOWN. THIS SNOWPACK SEEMED SOLID, AND IT SHOULD BE SAFE ENOUGH FOR ME TO CLIMB DOWN. I STILL WANT TO TREAD CAREFULLY, AS MOST AVALANCHES ARE TRIGGERED BY PEOPLE. EVERY YEAR, AN AVERAGE OF 160 PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE KILLED BY THEM. I MET A FAMILY RECENTLY WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN A HUGE AVALANCHE, AND WHEN IT STOPPED, THEY WERE COMPLETELY DISORIENTATED, HAD NO IDEA WHICH WAY WAS UP AND WHICH WAY WAS DOWN. AND WHAT THEY DID WAS THEN SPIT TO WORK OUT WHICH WAY WAS UP AND THEN DUG THEIR WAY OUT. AND IT WAS ONLY THEIR QUICK THINKING THAT SAVED THEIR LIVES. GRAVITY WILL MEAN YOUR SPIT WILL ALWAYS GO DOWN. AND WHEN YOU KNOW WHICH WAY TO DIG, YOU'VE THEN GOT TO MOVE FAST. ANYONE TRAPPED IN AN AVALANCHE WILL SUFFOCATE IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES. SOON I DROP UNDER THE CLOUDS. AND I'M FACED WITH A VAST, FROZEN LANDSCAPE. IT'S NOW 10 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, AND I WANT TO GET ACROSS THIS AS FAST AS I CAN. BUT THE SNOW-COVERED HEATHER IS REALLY SLOWING ME DOWN. THIS AREA'S SO EXPOSED THAT THERE'S NO PROTECTION FROM THE FREEZING WIND. THIS IS WHY THE SCOTTISH WEATHER CAN BE SO DANGEROUS. YOU GET THIS COMBINATION OF THESE FREEZING ARCTIC WINDS, ALONG WITH THIS DRIVING, DAMP, WET SNOW. AND THAT COMBINATION LITERALLY JUST SUCKS THE HEAT OUT OF YOUR BODY. AND THAT'S WHY IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED THAT THIS SORT OF WEATHER CAN KILL IN A MATTER OF JUST A FEW HOURS. THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN FIND SHELTER UP HERE. YOU'VE JUST REALLY GOT TO KEEP MOVING, KEEP YOUR HANDS AND YOUR FEET WORKING, AND KEEP HEADING DOWNHILL, TRYING TO GET OUT OF THIS WEATHER. IN 2006, 2 CLIMBERS WERE CAUGHT IN A STORM. THEY TRIED TO WALK TO SAFETY, BUT THE CONDITIONS GOT WORSE. THEY COULDN'T FIND SHELTER FROM THE WINDS, AND THE NEXT DAY, THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND ONLY ONE MILE FROM THE PARKING LOT. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT PEOPLE GET INTO TROUBLE UP HERE IS THAT THEY COME UP TO SCOTLAND AND THEY JUST UNDERESTIMATE JUST HOW FEROCIOUS THE WEATHER CAN BE UP HERE. AS I HEAD DOWN, THANKFULLY, THE WIND STARTS TO EASE. I'M STEADILY LOSING HEIGHT, AND HERE THE SNOW IS MELTING AND DRAINING INTO A STREAM. IF I FOLLOW THIS STREAM DOWN, IT SHOULD LEAD ME OFF THIS MOUNTAIN. YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOUR STEP WALKING IN THICK SNOW LIKE THIS. THERE ARE DANGERS EVERYWHERE. YOU SEE, IT'S A SNOW BRIDGE RUNNING STRAIGHT UNDER THAT. THAT WOULD BE SO EASY TO WALK ON AND NOT REALIZE. IT'S BEGINNING TO GET DARK NOW. MAYBE ONE HOUR OF LIGHT LEFT BEFORE THE WINTER SUN SETS AT 5:30. BUT THEN THE STREAM LEADS TO A SHEER 40-FOOT DROP. AND THERE'S NO WAY I'LL BE ABLE TO DOWN-CLIMB THIS. THIS IS JUST GONNA BE A SLIPPERY TUBE OF MOSS, WATER, ROCK, AND THEN SNOW AND ICE. I'M HIGH UP IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS. THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE IT DOWN THIS WATERFALL. IT'S JUST WAY TOO SLIPPERY TO DOWN-CLIMB THIS. I REALLY NEED TO TRY AND FIND ANOTHER WAY UP AND 'ROUND. THE LIGHT IS NOW FADING FAST, AND IT'S GETTING COLD. AT NIGHT UP HERE, IT CAN BE AS COLD AS MINUS-15 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. TOO COLD TO SURVIVE WITHOUT SHELTER. THERE ARE MORE THAN 25,000 DEER ROAMING WILD IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS. WE CAN SHOW YOU HOW A DEAD DEER COULD HELP YOU SURVIVE A FREEZING NIGHT. OH, LOOK. IT'S JUST BEEN COMPLETELY MANGLED. THERE'S BLOOD AND GUTS EVERYWHERE. AND HE'S A LITTLE STAG. I THINK I WANT TO TRY AND GET HIM OUT OF HERE. GOD, REALLY, REALLY STINKS, AS WELL. THIS MEAT'S GONNA BE NO GOOD TO EAT. WHAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IS JUST USE -- GOD, HE REALLY STINKS -- JUST USE THE FUR OFF HIM TO GIVE ME SOME WARMTH AND GIVE ME SOME PROTECTION. SO I'M GONNA DRAG HIM OUT OF HERE. IN SURVIVAL SITUATIONS, YOU HAVE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY NATURE PROVIDES. THE FUR ON THIS DEER IS REALLY THICK, AND IT'S COATED IN OILS, MAKING IT WATERPROOF. GOT TO GET HIM ON HIS BACK LIKE THAT. YOU SEE HOW HIS STOMACH IS PRETTY BLOATED THERE, WHICH MEANS HE'S BEEN DEAD A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE IS JUST GO DOWN THE BOTTOM, MAKE A LITTLE INCISION. I WANT TO BE PRETTY CAREFUL NOT TO PIERCE THE GUTS, THOUGH. I WANT TO KEEP THE FUR AS CLEAN AND DRY AS I CAN. ONCE YOU'VE GOT A BIT OF IT GOING, LIKE THIS IN HERE, YOU CAN SEE JUST THAT SKIN SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN CARCASS. REALLY, THEN YOU WANT TO USE AS LITTLE KNIFE AS POSSIBLE AND YOU JUST GET YOUR HAND IN WITH YOUR FIST DOWN AND THEN JUST UNROLL IT AND PUSH IT OFF. AND IT BECOMES A LOT EASIER AND A LOT QUICKER. SEE, LOOK, I'VE JUST DONE DOUBLE THE AMOUNT IN THAT BIT. LITTLE KNIFE IN THIS BIT. THE MEAT REALLY STINKS. IF IT WAS FRESH, IT WOULD BE PERFECT TO EAT. I WANT TO GET THE SKIN OFF IN ONE PIECE. THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDERS USED TO USE DEERSKIN TO MAKE SHOES. THEY WORE THEM WITH THE FUR ON THE OUTSIDE AND GOT THE NICKNAME ROUGH-FOOTED SCOTS. YOU CAN NOW USE THIS FUR, THOUGH, AS SHELTER. OKAY. THAT IS THE FUR OFF. AND LOOK AT THAT. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD HAVE USED FURS LIKE THIS FOR CENTURIES FOR BOTH PROTECTION FROM THE WEATHER AND ALSO FOR WARMTH. I'M NOT GONNA STAY MUCH LONGER. BUT IF YOU GOT STUCK HERE OVERNIGHT, THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO TO KEEP YOURSELF ALIVE. I CAN HARDLY SEE. I JUST NEED TO USE WHAT NATURE HAS PROVIDED ME HERE. BUT JUST UP THIS A LITTLE BIT, IT'S LIKE -- DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THE LITTLE GAP BETWEEN THERE WHERE THE SNOW HAS MELTED AGAINST THE ROCK. IT'S MADE A LITTLE HOLLOW, AND THAT'S GONNA BE GREAT. IT'S GONNA GET ME OUT OF THE WIND, WHICH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS I CAN DO THAT WOULD HELP. I HAVEN'T GOT A HAT, BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS IMPROVISE ONE. AND ALL I NEED TO DO FOR THIS IS TAKE MY FLEECE OFF HERE AND JUST...WITH MY KNIFE CUT THROUGH THE ARM OF IT. ONCE I'M THROUGH WITH THAT, JUST GIVE IT A STRETCH AND PUT IT STRAIGHT ONTO MY HEAD LIKE THIS. AND THAT'S GONNA KEEP SOME OF THE WARMTH IN. MIGHT LOOK A BIT DAFT, FEEL A BIT DAFT, BUT IT'S GONNA WORK. PUT THIS JACKET BACK ON. YOU LOSE 40% OF YOUR HEAT FROM YOUR HEAD. YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE ONLY HAS TO DROP BY 10 DEGREES FOR YOU TO END UP UNCONSCIOUS. AND THEN I PULL THIS GREAT BIG SKIN OF FUR OVER ME. STINKS LIKE ANYTHING, BUT AT LEAST KEEP ME, HOPEFULLY, WARM AND DRY. YEAH, THAT'S QUITE GOOD. OH, THIS CARCASS REALLY STINKS. IT'S ALSO STARTED RAINING, AND I'M BEGINNING TO GET QUITE COLD NOW. AND I ALSO NEED TO PEE, WHICH IS JUST BORING. AND I DON'T WANT TO JUST WASTE THE PEE BY DOING IT INTO THE SNOW. WHAT YOU CAN DO IS USE YOUR PEE TO KEEP YOURSELF WARM. IT WON'T LAST VERY LONG, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN JUST PEEING INTO THE SNOW. THIS WOULD GIVE AN INSTANT HOT-WATER BOTTLE. KEEP THAT UNDER MY JACKET. WITH OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES OF MINUS-10 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO SURVIVE BLIZZARDS IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS. IT'S MORNING IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS. THIS MIST HAS JUST REALLY CLAGGED IN NOW, AND IT MAKES IT REALLY DISORIENTATING. YOU SEE HOW EASY IT IS TO GET LOST AND LOSE YOUR BEARINGS. BUT OFTEN, THOUGH, WHEN THERE'S STILL WINDS LIKE THIS, IT MEANS THE MIST HANGS AROUND ON THE MOUNTAINTOPS. AND WHAT I'M HOPING IS IF I FOLLOW THIS STREAM DOWN JUST MAYBE A FEW HUNDRED FEET, I MIGHT DROP OUT OF IT. I NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO GET WARM AND TO GET OFF THIS MOUNTAIN. WALKING IN THIS MIST, I CAN SEE WHY THE EARLY HIGHLANDERS BELIEVED THE MOUNTAINS WERE HAUNTED BY EVIL SPIRITS AND WHY THEY RARELY CAME UP INTO THESE HIGH GROUNDS. 10,000 YEARS AGO, THIS WHOLE AREA WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED IN MASSIVE GLACIERS THAT CARVED OUT THESE IMMENSE VALLEYS. JUST DROPPED UNDER THIS CLOUD NOW, AND LOOK -- IT'S ONLY MY FIRST VIEW OF ONE OF THESE JUST HUGE VALLEYS. AND THAT IS SPECTACULAR. I'M STANDING ON THE EDGE OF A MASSIVE HORSESHOE-SHAPED CLIFF, AND I KNOW THAT THE SIDE WITH THE THICKEST SNOW COVER FACES NORTH, AS IT GETS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF SUN. SO IF I HEAD STRAIGHT DOWN THIS SNOWBANK, I'LL BE HEADING NORTH. I'M OFF THE SNOW UP THERE. AND I'M DOWN NOW INTO ALL OF THIS ROCK. NOW, SEE, A LOT OF THIS IS NOW LOOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SCREE-RUN. BUT THE TECHNIQUE FOR DOING THIS IS JUST KEEP A LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY AND KEEP YOUR BALANCE. AND WHEN YOU DO START TO GO, DON'T RESIST IT. YOU KNOW, GO WITH THE FLOW. GET THIS RIGHT, AND IT'S EASY THE QUICKEST WAY DOWN. I'M INTO ANOTHER OF THESE HUGE VALLEYS. THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE LIVING HERE SINCE 4000 B.C. AND THE EARLY HIGHLANDERS HAD A REPUTATION FOR BEING INCREDIBLY TOUGH. AND TO SURVIVE IN THESE FREEZING CONDITIONS, THEY NEEDED TO BE. IF YOU'RE IN THIS OPEN LANDSCAPE AND NEED TO CHECK WHICH WAY TO GO, EVEN IN THIS BLEAKNESS, NATURE PROVIDES CLUES. WHAT I'M SEEING AS I MOVE THROUGH THIS VALLEY IS THERE'S QUITE DISTINCTLY MORE MOSS GROWING ON A LOT OF THESE ROCKS ON ONE SIDE THAN THE OTHER. THIS IS MUCH BARER. AND WHAT THIS TELLS ME IS WHERE ALL THIS MOSS IS IS ACTUALLY NORTH-FACING. THIS WILL GET LESS SUNLIGHT. THERE WILL BE MORE MOISTURE. AND ALL OF THIS WILL GROW. IT'S A GOOD, RELIABLE INDICATOR OF NORTH AND SOUTH. EVEN IN THE COLD, IT'S EASY TO GET DEHYDRATED. YOU NEED TO DRINK AT LEAST HALF A GALLON OF WATER A DAY. BUT THERE IS A WAY OF FINDING WATER OUT HERE THAT IS SAFE TO DRINK. THIS IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I KEEP SEEING THIS RED STUFF AROUND. WHAT THIS ACTUALLY IS, IT'S CALLED SPHAGNUM MOSS. IF I PULL A BIT OF THIS OUT, YOU CAN SEE IT. BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE THIS AS LIKE A MINOR ANTISEPTIC. WHAT IT CONTAINS IS IODINE. YOU CAN ACTUALLY DRINK FROM IT. THE MOSS ITSELF WILL CLEAN A LOT OF THE DIRT AWAY, AND THEN THE IODINE INSIDE WILL KILL A LOT OF THE BACTERIA. ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SQUEEZE IT AND DRINK. SPHAGNUM MOSS IS USED IN ORGANIC WATER FILTERS, AS THE FIBERS IN THE MOSS STRAIN OUT DIRT AND HEAVY METALS. IN THIS COLD, DAMP WEATHER, THE MOSS SLOWLY ROTS AND FORMS A DARK, HEAVY SOIL CALLED PEAT. WHEN THIS SOIL DRIES OUT, IT BURNS LIKE COAL, AND THE HIGHLANDERS USED BLOCKS OF DRIED PEAT AS THEIR FUEL. WHEN IT'S WATERLOGGED, THOUGH, THIS STUFF IS A NIGHTMARE TO WALK THROUGH. THERE'S OVER 20 SQUARE MILES OF THIS WET MARSH BOG HERE, AND SOME OF IT CAN BE EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. THERE WAS A GUY OUT HERE WHO GOT STUCK IN A BOG FOR FOUR DAYS, AND HIS LIFE WAS ONLY SAVED 'CAUSE A FARMER FOUND HIM ALIVE BUT UNCONSCIOUS. BUT IF YOU DID GO INTO A BOG LIKE THIS, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO BE ABLE TO DO TO GET OUT OF IT. SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO HERE IS JUST STRIP OFF AND DO IT MYSELF. THE LAST THING I WANT OUT HERE WHERE IT'S COLD IS SOAKING-WET CLOTHES. A THICK LAYER OF ALGAE COVERS THE SURFACE OF THESE MUD PITS. THIS MAKES IT SO HARD TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WHAT YOU CAN WALK ACROSS AND WHAT YOU CAN'T. NOW, I'M GONNA FEEL A LITTLE BIT STUPID IF I WALK ACROSS THIS ABSOLUTELY FINE. SO, HERE YOU GO. OH, GOD. THIS STUFF JUST STINKS! AND, REALLY, THE FIRST THING IS JUST THIS IS FREEZING, FREEZING COLD. AND YOU NEED TO FIGHT THE URGE OF PANIC AND TRY AND KEEP CALM, 'CAUSE THE MORE YOU FIGHT IT, THE MORE IT'S GONNA SUCK YOU IN. BUT THE WAY I WANT TO GO OUT IS THIS WAY 'CAUSE THIS IS WHERE I KNOW IT'S SOLID ENOUGH. AND THEN JUST SWIM WITH BIG, NICE STROKES TO THE EDGE. AND LOOK -- YOU SEE THE WAY MY HANDS GOT CAUGHT AROUND ALL OF THESE ROOTS. AND THIS IS WHY THESE THINGS ARE DANGEROUS. THAT HAD TO BE ONE OF THE WORST STINK PITS I HAVE EVER BEEN IN. AND WHAT I CAN DO JUST TO GET SOME OF THIS OFF ME IS USE SOME OF THIS MOSS. USE THAT JUST TO SCRAPE -- SCRAPE THIS OFF. I'M SURE I COULD FEEL BITS OF DEAD ANIMALS IN THERE. IT FELT LIKE BLOATED STOMACHS UNDER MY FEET. THAT'S A DEATH PIT FOR ANY SHEEP OR DEER THAT FALL IN. GOD, IT'S LIKE A SEWER OF ABOUT THREE CITIES GOING INTO ONE LITTLE HOLE. WHEN THE GROUND DRIES OUT IN SUMMER, THAT MUD WILL BE THICKER, AND THERE WILL BE EVEN MORE ROOTS. AND THAT MAKES IT EVEN HARDER TO GET OUT OF. USE A BIT OF THIS MOSS JUST TO CLEAN SOME OF THIS HORRIBLE STUFF OFF MY FACE. BUT IT'S TIME TO GET DRESSED AND MOVING AGAIN. THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS STILL HAVE AN AWFUL LOT LEFT TO THROW AT ME. I'M IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS MOVING DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS TOWARDS A VAST PINE FOREST. THESE RIVERS ARE FULL OF BROWN TROUT, BUT IN WINTER, THEY'RE IN DEEP, WARMER WATER, MAKING THEM SO DIFFICULT TO CATCH. OUT HERE, THERE'S JUST HARDLY ANYTHING TO EAT. YOU SEE THESE MUSHROOMS -- THESE MUSHROOMS HERE. AND IT'S ALWAYS -- YOU KNOW, IT'S ALWAYS TEMPTING WHEN YOU COME ACROSS MUSHROOMS IN THE WILD JUST TO EAT THEM, ESPECIALLY FOR ME, 'CAUSE I LOVE MUSHROOMS. BUT, ACTUALLY, THE REALITY OF THEM IS, ALMOST 80% OF MUSHROOMS YOU COME ACROSS ARE ACTUALLY POISONOUS. THERE'S ALSO ALMOST ZERO NUTRITIONAL VALUE IN THEM. SO, REALLY, UNLESS YOU'RE 100% POSITIVE IDENTIFYING IT, JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE. THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO FILL UP MY WATER BOTTLE. IT'S A FAST-FLOWING RIVER, AND THE WATER IS COLD. BACTERIA GROWS SLOWLY IN COLD CONDITIONS, SO I DON'T NEED TO BOIL THIS WATER BEFORE I DRINK IT. THIS IS FOX POO HERE, AND I CAN TELL THAT BECAUSE IT'S BLACK AND IT'S ALSO GOT, LIKE, TAPERED ENDS. AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DO -- THEY OFTEN DO IT ON HIGH GROUND LIKE THIS AS A WAY OF MARKING THEIR TERRITORY. BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE, IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS, YOU CAN SEE SOME RABBIT FUR JUST ON THE OUTSIDE OF IT. RABBITS DON'T HIBERNATE THROUGH WINTER. THEY ARE MY BEST CHANCE OF DECENT FOOD. BUT THEY'RE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CATCH BY HAND. ALL OF THIS HERE IS JUST PERFECT TERRITORY FOR RABBITS. YOU SEE OPEN GRASSLAND, LONG GRASS, HEATHER, LOTS OF LITTLE RUNS THAT ARE GONNA LEAD BETWEEN THE BURROWS AND WHERE THEY'RE FEEDING AND WHERE THEY'RE DRINKING. AND THIS IS GONNA BE A GOOD PLACE FOR ME TO SET SOME SNARES. AND ALL I'M GONNA DO IS USE SOME OF THE PARACORD, TYING MY BOTTLE TOGETHER. YOU CAN USE ANY SORT OF STRING, REALLY. IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT THIS, YOU CAN USE YOUR SHOELACES OR YOUR BOOT LACES. TIGHTEN THIS AND JUST PUT A LITTLE KNOT IN THE END OF IT. THREAD THAT THROUGH THERE. AND I'VE GOT, THEN, A SIMPLE NOOSE. WITH A SHARP STICK AS A STAKE, I'M READY TO SET MY SNARE. WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR HERE ARE JUST THESE RUNS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THIS. REALLY CLEARLY, IT'S LIKE A RABBIT'S MOTORWAY. THEY'LL USE THESE, JUST GO BACK AND FORWARD BETWEEN THEIR BURROWS AND WHERE THEY'RE FEEDING AND WHERE THEY'RE DRINKING. BUT WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS NOT TO SET THE SNARES NEAR THEIR BURROWS. THEY'RE ESPECIALLY WARY WHEN THEY FIRST COME OUT OF THEM. YOU WANT TO SET THEM SOMEWHERE THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH AND THEY'RE USING JUST BACK AND FORWARD. AND, REALLY, I WANT TO DO AS LITTLE WORK AS POSSIBLE NEAR THE SITE. I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE SMELLING ME. SO, IF I LAY IT HERE... I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE STAKE IS REALLY WELL IN THE GROUND SO IF I DO CATCH SOMETHING, IT'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PULL IT OUT. AND THEN TAKE A COUPLE OF JUST LITTLE TWIGS AND PUT ONE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ACTUAL RUN ITSELF. AND THEN TAKE THE NOOSE. AND I WANT THE NOOSE, IDEALLY, TO BE LIKE ABOUT FIVE FINGER HEIGHT OFF THE GROUND SO IT CATCHES THE HEAD AND ITS EARS, AND BIG ENOUGH FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO GET ITS EARS THROUGH, AND JUST A BIT BIGGER THAN FIST SIZE IS GOOD. OKAY. I'M GONNA SET ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE AND HOPE THAT I GET SOMETHING. I HAVE TO BE PATIENT AND LEAVE THESE TRAPS OUT OVERNIGHT. I'M HEADING INTO THE FOREST NOW TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO MAKE SHELTER. I'M NOT STAYING THE NIGHT, BUT THIS WILL BE A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO MAKE YOUR CAMP. I'VE GOT SOME PROTECTION AMONGST THE TREES FROM THE WEATHER, A NICE, SOFT, PRETTY DRY GRASS AND THE FUR AS INSULATION. AND I'VE GOT A STREAM NEARBY. AND WHAT I CAN DO IS JUST USE WHAT NATURE'S ALREADY PROVIDED. THE BRANCH OF THIS FALLEN TREE CAN ACT AS A BACKBONE FOR A HALF-DOME SHELTER. IT'S THE BEST SHAPE, AS IT HAS NO CORNERS. THE AIR KEEPS CIRCULATING, AND THAT WILL KEEP ME WARMER. ONCE I'VE GOT THIS IN PLACE, THEN ALL I THEN NEED IS A LOAD OF PINE BOUGHS JUST TO DRAPE OVER THE TOP OF THIS. THICK PINE BRANCHES PROVIDE INSULATION AND WATERPROOFING. AS MANY OF THESE BRANCHES I CAN INTERWEAVE AS POSSIBLE MEANS THEY WILL SUPPORT THEMSELVES, AND IT JUST GIVES IT BETTER STRENGTH. TO GET A FIRE STARTED QUICKLY IN THESE DAMP CONDITIONS, I'M LOOKING FOR NATURE'S FIRE LIGHTER. THESE DEAD BIRCHES ARE REALLY GOOD TO USE AS TINDER, AND I CAN TELL THEY'RE BIRCH JUST FROM THEIR SILVER LIMBS AND THIS VERY DISTINCT WHITE BARK. BUT THE BIT I WANT IS ALL OF THIS OUTER BARK HERE. ONCE YOU GOT THIS, IF YOU CRUSH THIS UP, BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF OILS THAT'S IN HERE, THIS WILL TAKE A SPARK REALLY WELL. WITH SUBZERO TEMPERATURES AT NIGHT, A FIRE CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS JUST BUILT UP A BIT OF A BANK OF THESE LOGS TO ACT LIKE A FIRE REFLECTOR. AND THIS IS GONNA REFLECT, HOPEFULLY, A LOT OF HEAT OF MY FIRE BACK INTO THE SHELTER. I'VE GOT A BASE HERE OF WOOD -- AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS TO LIFT THE FIRE OFF THE WET GROUND AND ALSO ALLOW THE AIR TO CIRCULATE -- A PILE OF KINDLING, AND THEN THIS BIRCH TINDER. AND WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS JUST SCRAPING OFF THE OUTER BARK INTO, LIKE, SHAVINGS. IT'S ALMOST LIKE BIG SAWDUST. THIS IS GONNA IGNITE REALLY EASILY. GET MY FLINT. AND I HOPE THIS GOES. OKAY. THERE WE GO. GIVE IT LOTS OF OXYGEN. [ FIRE CRACKLING ] DON'T GO OUT. OKAY. AND YOU CAN HEAR THAT CRACKLING, AND THAT'S ALL OF THOSE NATURAL OILS BURNING. AND AS THE TWIGS START TO DRY OUT, THEY START TO BURN. IT'S LIKE SIZZLING LIKE GUNPOWDER. USING THE CUP FROM MY WATER BOTTLE, I CAN NOW MAKE MYSELF A HOT DRINK. WHAT I HAVEN'T GOT IS ANYTHING GOOD TO EAT, BUT AT LEAST I'VE GOT A SHELTER. I'VE GOT A NICE, ROARING FIRE, WHICH WILL BE GOOD FOR MORALE. AND THE NEXT BEST THING -- A CUP OF BOILING WATER ON THE GO FOR ME TO MAKE A NICE CUP OF TEA. THEN ALL I NEED TO DO IS GRAB SOME OF THESE PINE NEEDLES, TEAR THEM OFF, AND THEN PUT THAT INTO THE MUG. AND THAT'S REALLY GOOD VITAMIN C. IT'S GONNA KEEP MY CORE TEMPERATURE UP, AS WELL. PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD HAVE BEEN DRINKING PINE-NEEDLE TEA FOR CENTURIES. PINE NEEDLES, WEIGHT FOR WEIGHT, HAVE FIVE TIMES AS MUCH VITAMIN C AS A LEMON. AND THEY TASTE PRETTY GOOD. THAT'S BETTER. THERE'S NO CLOUDS, AND IT'S A COLD NIGHT. BUT THIS PINEWOOD CREATES AN INTENSE FIRE. IT'S NOT RAINING. AND I'M ACTUALLY QUITE COZY IN THIS SHELTER. I WAS JUST THINKING BACK TO EVERYTHING I'VE LEARNED ABOUT SURVIVAL OVER THE YEARS, AND, YOU KNOW, IN SO MANY WAYS, WHAT MATTERS MUCH MORE THAN KNOWING ALL OF THE SKILLS IN THE WORLD IS ACTUALLY JUST HAVING THAT DETERMINATION TO STAY ALIVE, AND IT'S OFTEN ABOUT JUST KEEPING GOING, KEEPING MAKING DECISIONS, AND KEEPING CALM AND, ALSO, I THINK, TRYING TO KEEP CHEERFUL EVEN WHEN THINGS REALLY SEEM STACKED AGAINST YOU. ULTIMATELY, THAT'S WHAT REALLY MATTERS, I THINK. AND WHEN YOU'RE UP AGAINST IT, A POSITIVE ATTITUDE IS EVERYTHING. I'M JUST GETTING THIS FIRE STOKED UP PROPERLY AGAIN. AND THEN I'M GONNA GO AND SEE IF I'VE HAD ANY LUCK WITH MY TRAPS. RABBITS WERE BROUGHT IN AND RELEASED IN THE 18th CENTURY FOR FOOD. THERE'S NOW 9.5 MILLION RABBITS IN SCOTLAND, AND THEY'RE AN AGRICULTURAL PEST. MY TRAPS DIDN'T CATCH ANYTHING OVERNIGHT, BUT I'VE GOT A RABBIT HERE TO SHOW YOU WHAT TO DO IF YOU DO GET LUCKY. HOLD HIM DOWN, TWIST HIS HEAD, GRAB HIS HIND QUARTERS, AND JUST BREAK HIS NECK LIKE THAT. IF YOU'RE IN ANY DOUBT AFTER THAT, JUST GIVE HIM A REALLY GOOD HIT ON THE BACK OF THE HEAD. BUT THAT'S HIM -- HIM DEAD. PULL THIS OUT. TAKE HIM BACK, SKIN HIM, AND COOK HIM. THAT'S BREAKFAST. DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THERE'S ANYTHING IN ANY OF THESE OTHER TRAPS. SO I WANT TO DISMANTLE THESE. IT'S ALWAYS KIND OF GOLDEN RULE -- JUST NEVER LEAVE SNARES SET ONCE YOU FINISH WITH THEM. TO COOK A RABBIT, SLICE THROUGH THE UNDERBELLY, PEEL BACK THE SKIN, AND THEN PULL OUT THE GUTS. OKAY. THIS IS GUTTED AND READY TO COOK. WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS MAKE LIKE A REALLY SIMPLE PRONG TO SPIT-ROAST IT. THIS PRONG NEEDS TO BE 2 FOOT LONGER THAN THE RABBIT SO THAT THE CARCASS FITS IN THE MIDDLE AND THERE'S A FOOT LENGTH AT EACH END TO BALANCE IT OVER THE FIRE. THE BEST MEAT IS ON THE BACK LEGS, AND I WANT TO PIN THEM FLAT TO COOK THEM FAST AND EVEN. OVER A HOT FIRE, AN ADULT RABBIT WILL TAKE ABOUT 30 MINUTES TO COOK. LET'S GIVE THIS A TRY. OH, LOOK AT THAT! MMM. TASTES LIKE RABBIT. NO, IT TASTES AMAZING. REALLY GOOD. AND IT'S QUITE -- YOU KNOW, GAME TASTE IS ALWAYS STRONG, STRONG MEAT. BUT I LIKE THAT, AND IT'S DELICIOUS. IT'S A GREAT BREAKFAST. BUT I NOW NEED WATER AND TO START FOLLOWING THE RIVER DOWN. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] SCOTLAND -- IT'S STARTING TO RAIN AGAIN. IN WINTER, IT SEEMS JUST TO RAIN HERE ALL THE TIME. BUT AT LEAST THESE TREES IN THIS ANCIENT WOODLAND ARE GIVING ME SOME SHELTER. ALL OF THIS HERE IS CALEDONIAN FOREST, AND CALEDONIA WAS A ROMAN NAME FOR SCOTLAND. BUT IN THE MIDDLE AGES, ALMOST ALL OF THE NORTH OF BRITAIN WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED IN FOREST JUST LIKE THIS. ACROSS THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, PEOPLE EARNED A LIVING BY CUTTING DOWN THE PINE TREES AND SENDING THEM TO THE SHIPYARDS ON THE COAST. SOME OF THEIR OLD HOMESTEADS HAVE SINCE BEEN CONVERTED INTO MOUNTAIN HUTS FOR HIKERS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE JUST THROUGH THE TREES THERE, ACROSS THE GULLY, THERE'S A BUILDING. AND THAT MIGHT WELL BE MY TICKET OUT OF HERE. BUT I'M ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE RIVER, AND THERE'S NOWHERE TO JUMP, AND IT'S TOO FAST TO SWIM. I'M IN THE SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS, AND I'VE MADE MY WAY OVER 2,500 FEET DOWN INTO THE FOREST. AND JUST THROUGH THE TRESS, I CAN SEE A BUILDING. YOU OFTEN GET THESE IN THE MOUNTAINS IN SCOTLAND. THEY'RE KNOWN AS BOTHIES. AND PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS LIVE IN THEM, BUT THEY ACT AS LIKE A REFUGE. I KNOW OF ONE COUPLE WHO GOT COMPLETELY LOST WHEN THEY MISREAD THEIR COMPASS, AND THEY HEADED OFF EAST INSTEAD OF WEST. AND THEY WOULD HAVE DIED IF THEY HADN'T COME ACROSS ONE OF THESE TO ACT AS A REFUGE. THIS RIVER IS A MAJOR OBSTACLE. THAT WHITE WATER IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WADE THROUGH, AND THE BANKS ARE TOO WIDE TO JUMP. A PINE TREE, THOUGH, HAS FALLEN ACROSS THE RIVER. IF I CAN GET DOWN TO THE BANK, I CAN SEE IF I CAN MAKE MY WAY ACROSS IT. THESE HUGE PINES HAVE SHALLOW ROOTS AND ARE EASILY BROUGHT DOWN BY HIGH WINDS. THIS ONE STRADDLES THE WIDEST POINT, BUT IT COULD BE THE WAY OVER THESE RAPIDS AND UP TO THE HUT. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET ACROSS THIS. MY ONLY CONCERN IS WHETHER -- WHETHER THIS IS ROTTEN. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S BEEN HERE QUITE SOME TIME. IT FEELS PRETTY STURDY, AND I KNOW THAT WOOD ROTS SLOWER IN COLDER CLIMATES. I'M HOPING THIS IS GONNA BE STRONG ENOUGH. LAST YEAR, THOUGH, IN THE U.K., OVER 80 PEOPLE DIED BY FALLING INTO RIVERS. WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO HERE IS JUST REALLY GRIP WITH MY THIGHS AND THEN JUST USE MY HANDS TO LIFT MYSELF UP AND SHIFT MY BODY ALONG. BUT THIS IS ALL ABOUT JUST KEEPING YOUR BALANCE AND I GUESS ALSO KEEPING YOUR NERVE. EITHER WAY, I'M PRETTY COMMITTED NOW. WITH ALL OF THIS MOSS AND ROTTING WOOD AND WATER, IT'S LITERALLY JUST LIKE GREASE UP HERE. AND I DO NOT WANT TO END UP DOWN IN THAT. FALLING INTO THIS FAST-FLOWING, FREEZING WHITE WATER IN ALL MY CLOTHES WOULD BE A DISASTER. IT'S ALL GOOD JUST GETTING OVER ALL OF THESE DEAD BRANCHES. [ GRUNTS ] AND IT'S NOT DOING MY MANHOOD MUCH GOOD, EITHER. THESE OLD DWELLINGS CAN BE A REAL SAFE HAVEN FOR ANYONE WHO'S LOST. AND HIKERS WILL OFTEN LEAVE SUPPLIES IN THEM FOR OTHERS TO USE. LOOKING PRETTY DESERTED. ALTHOUGH IT DOES LOOK LIKE SOMEBODY'S BEEN DOING SOME WORK IN HERE. I'VE TURNED UP IN THESE BOTHIES IN SCOTLAND, AND LITERALLY THERE'S BEEN LIKE A WOOD-BURNING STOVE, PRE-LAID FIRE. I'VE EVEN KNOWN IT TO HAVE A LITTLE TIN OF SUGAR AND TEA BAGS. BUT THERE'S NOTHING, REALLY, I CAN USE. THE BUILDERS WON'T BE WORKING HERE IN WINTER. WALKING THROUGH THIS HEATHER IS TIRING, AND IT'S HARD TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE STEPPING ON. THAT'S THE THIRD TIME I'VE DONE THAT IN AN HOUR. THIS IS GETTING BORING. I'M LOSING MY WHOLE LEG IN ALL THESE HOLES. BUT SURVIVAL IS ABOUT TRYING JUST TO KEEP POSITIVE, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE COLD AND TIRED. THINK ABOUT WHAT MATTERS MOST, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR FRIENDS, WHATEVER IT TAKES TO KEEP YOURSELF MOVING. IN SCOTLAND, THE TYPES OF TERRAIN ARE JUST SO DIVERSE. YOU SEE OVER THERE THAT THE TREES SUDDENLY CHANGE. THEY'RE LIGHTER, AND THEY'RE ALSO IN THESE ROWS. AND THAT MEANS ONE THING -- A PLANTATION. BUT WHAT YOU'D BE HOPING FOR IS THAT IT'S A LOGGING PLANTATION, 'CAUSE WHERE THERE'S LOGGING, THERE'S TRUCKS, AND WHERE THERE'S TRUCKS, THERE'S ROADS. BUT IN THIS AREA, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF THESE TREE FARMS. BUT THEY'LL ONLY BE LOGGING A FEW AREAS AT A TIME. THESE NONNATIVE PINE TREES ARE PLANTED LESS THAN 3 FEET APART. I WANT TO KEEP A STRAIGHT PATH THROUGH THESE TREES, BUT IT'S NOT EASY. ALL OF THIS IS POKE-YOUR-EYE-OUT FOREST -- ALL OF THESE SPINDLY, LITTLE BRANCHES. NOT MAKING IT EASY. THE TREES ARE SO CLOSELY PACKED THAT THE LIGHT FADES EVEN FASTER IN HERE. IT'S SO EASY TO GET DISORIENTATED AND LOST. OH, LOOK. DEFINITE SIGNS OF LOGGING. THE WOOD IS FRESHLY CUT. THE ENDS LOOK CLEAN, AND I CAN SMELL THE PINE RESIN. WHERE THERE ARE FELLED TREES, THERE'S OFTEN PEOPLE. NOW YOU'D KNOW YOU'RE SAFE. THE HARSH BEAUTY OF THIS SCOTTISH LANDSCAPE HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR CENTURIES. IT'S A PLACE I LOVE AND ONE OF THE FEW AREAS LEFT IN THE U.K. WHICH STILL HAS THIS RAW AND UNTAMED SPIRIT. IT'S A TRULY MAGICAL PLACE. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
