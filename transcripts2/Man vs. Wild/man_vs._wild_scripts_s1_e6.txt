 MY NAME IS BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES. I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS. FIVE MILLION RAFTERS, HIKERS, AND CLIMBERS COME HERE EVERY YEAR, AND EACH YEAR 200 END UP IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO SURVIVE. I'M FLYING OVER THE VAST SIERRA MOUNTAIN RANGE IN CALIFORNIA --

 400 MILES OF TOWERING PEAKS, DEEP FORESTS, AND SCORCHING LOWLANDS. I'M ABOUT TO PUT MYSELF INTO THE POSITION OF SOMEONE STRANDED OUT THERE. IF NEEDED, I'LL BE RECEIVING SOME HELP FROM LOCAL EXPERTS, AND A FILM CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. WHEN PARACHUTING OVER MOUNTAINS, YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL. THE AIR IS THINNER AT SUCH HIGH ALTITUDES, SO YOU'LL FALL MUCH FASTER THAN NORMAL. IT'S A GOOD IDEA, IF YOU CAN, TO TRY TO REDUCE THE RISK OF INJURY BY LANDING IN WATER. THERE ARE SOME HIGH ALPINE LAKES DOWN THERE, AND THAT'S THE KIND OF PLACE YOU'D NEED TO AIM FOR.

 WHOO-HOO! TO LAND ON THE MOUNTAIN FACES RISKS SERIOUS INJURY, BUT LANDING IN WATER WOULD GIVE YOU A WHOLE DIFFERENT PROBLEM. AT THIS HEIGHT, IN WET CLOTHES THERE'S A REAL RISK OF HYPOTHERMIA. BUT WHICH IS THE BEST WAY DOWN? THE SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN FACE EAST AND WEST. I MUST CHOOSE ONE DIRECTION. I DON'T WANT TO GO EAST. THAT WILL TAKE ME INTO THE HEAT OF THE NEVADA DESERT. SO I'M HEADING WEST. AND WHILE THE SUN'S DRYING ALL THIS STUFF OUT, THIS IS A GOOD CHANCE JUST TO TRY AND GET MY BEARINGS A BIT OUT HERE. AND ON A NICE DAY, WITH THE SUN SHINING LIKE THIS, A REALLY EASY WAY OF FINDING NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, AND WEST IS JUST USING A SHADOW-STICK METHOD. AND ALL I NEED FOR THIS IS ANY BIT OF THIS. THIS WILL DO. ALL I DO IS JAM THIS INTO THE GROUND, AND THIS CASTS A NICE SHADOW THERE. AND JUST MARK IT WHERE THE END OF THE SHADOW IS. THEN JUST LEAVE IT 15 MINUTES, AND WHILE MY CLOTHES ARE DRYING, I LET THAT SHADOW SLOWLY MOVE, AND THEN I MARK THE NEXT POINT, AND THIS WILL GIVE ME AN EAST-WEST LINE THEN. IT'S A REALLY SIMPLE WAY OF JUST WORKING OUT YOUR DIRECTION. THERE ARE ONLY HAVE SIX HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT, AND A NIGHT AT THIS ALTITUDE CAN KILL. BUT FIRST, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO COLLECT SOME WATER. AND HAVING A SUPPLY OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER IS AN ABSOLUTE PRIORITY. THE WATER HERE LOOKS CRYSTAL-CLEAR, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PURE. THE WATER'S STAGNANT, IDEAL GROWING CONDITIONS FOR HARMFUL BACTERIA. ONE OF MY OLDEST BUDDIES FROM THE ARMY, I REMEMBER, DRANK FROM A LAKE JUST LIKE THIS, AND HE ENDED UP WITH REALLY BAD DIARRHEA AND VOMITING FOR ABOUT A WEEK, AND I DON'T WANT TO RISK THAT. SO I'M GONNA FILL MY WATER BOTTLE, BUT I'M NOT GONNA DRINK FROM IT UNTIL I GET A CHANCE TO BOIL IT LATER ON. BY NOW, MY MAKESHIFT SUNDIAL SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME WHICH WAY TO GO. I CAN JUST SEE HOW THE SHADOW NOW HAS MOVED 'ROUND, AND THIS IS THE ORIGINAL MARKER. SO, FIND ANOTHER STONE. THAT'S WHERE IT ENDED UP NOW, IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES. SO THAT IS A PRETTY RELIABLE, BUT ROUGH, EAST-WEST LINE. THAT'S WEST. NEVADA'S DESERT'S THE EAST. I DON'T WANT TO GO THAT WAY. WEST I'M GOING. FIRST YOU'D NEED TO DECIDE WHICH PART OF THE MOUNTAIN IS EASIEST TO DESCEND. THE WARM RAYS OF THE SUN HAVE MADE THE SNOW UNSTABLE. IF YOU HAVE TO CROSS A FACE LIKE THIS, IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SURE OF EACH FOOTHOLD YOU MAKE IN THE SNOW. IT'S SLIPPERY, BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT TO GO FOR IT. A LOT OF THE ROCK AROUND HERE IS THIS GRANITE. AND WHAT YOU GET IN THIS GRANITE ARE THESE DENTS AND THESE DEPRESSIONS. AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR WHEN THERE ARE LOTS OF THUNDERSTORMS, THEY COLLECT THIS RAINWATER. AND THIS STUFF SHOULD BE OKAY. WHAT I WANT TO WATCH OUT FOR, THOUGH, ARE THINGS LIKE ANIMAL CRAP IN HERE. THIS SORT OF THING IS -- CAN OFTEN LEAD TO GIARDIA, AND THE LAST THING I NEED IS ANY DIARRHEA. AND THIS STUFF IS LOOKING QUITE CLEAN AND SHOULD BE OKAY. IT SEEMS BARREN UP HERE. BUT IT'S ASTONISHING WHAT YOU CAN FIND IN THESE MOUNTAINS. IT'S SO EASY JUST TO WALK OVER THESE ROCKS AND NOT NOTICE THAT, ACTUALLY, A LOT OF THEM CAN BE REALLY USEFUL. HERE WE GO -- THIS STUFF. THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED FOOL'S GOLD. IT'S ACTUALLY PYRITE. A LOT OF THE GOLD RUSH OF THE LATE 1800s TOOK PLACE AROUND HERE, AND PEOPLE WOULD OFTEN MISTAKE THIS STUFF FOR GOLD. BUT IT'S NOT. IT WAS NO USE TO THEM AT ALL. BUT FOR ME, THIS COULD BE REALLY USEFUL LATER ON. NOW I'VE GOT HOLD OF SOME OBSIDIAN TO SHOW YOU. LOOK AT THAT -- BLACK AND SPARKLY. IT LOOKS LIKE GLASS, AND THAT MEANS IT'S OBSIDIAN. AND THIS STUFF IS ACTUALLY TRADED A LOT BY AMERICAN INDIANS JUST TO MAKE TOOLS OUT OF, AND IT'S ALSO WHAT THEY'D MAKE THEIR ARROWHEADS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLY SHARP. IT'S STILL USED TODAY. AND ACTUALLY THE SHARPEST BLADES AND SCALPELS IN THE WORLD ARE MADE OUT OF THIS STUFF, AND I'M GONNA KEEP HOLD OF THIS. IT'S GONNA BE USEFUL FOR ME FOR CUTTING. BUT KEEP A CAREFUL WATCH, AS THE TERRAIN CAN CHANGE VERY QUICKLY. IT'S A 350-FOOT DROP TO THE BOTTOM. TO WALK AROUND COULD TAKE HOURS -- TIME YOU MAY NOT HAVE. REALLY, THE SAFE THING TO DO WOULD BE TO TRY AND FIND ANOTHER ROUTE AROUND. AND THESE ARE THUNDERSTORM CLOUDS. AND YOU'RE MUCH, MUCH MORE VULNERABLE AND EXPOSED TO STORMS AND LIGHTNING WHEN YOU'RE HIGHER UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. [ GRUNTS ] I'M AN EXPERIENCED CLIMBER, AND I'M GONNA TRY AND ATTEMPT THIS WITHOUT ROPES OR ANY OTHER MODERN ROCK-CLIMBING AID. AND HERE'S HOW YOU DO IT. AND THE KEY WITH COMING DOWN THIS SORT OF ROCK IS ALWAYS KEEPING FRICTION ON THE ROCK, THROUGH YOUR FEET AND THROUGH BOTH YOUR HANDS, IF YOU CAN. AND YOU DON'T WANT TO BE SLIDING. YOU JUST WANT TO BE SHUFFLING CAREFULLY DOWN IT. WHEN IT GETS STEEP, YOU WANT TO TURN OVER ONTO YOUR STOMACH. [ BREATHES HEAVILY ] YOU SEE HOW CRUMBLY A LOT OF THE EDGES OF THIS GETS, AND THE REAL DANGER IS WHEN YOU GET SAND AND GRAVEL ON THE TOP. IT BECOMES SO SLIPPERY. AND ALSO WATER -- WATER ON THIS GRANITE TURNS IT INTO SLICK ROCK, AND IF IT RAINS, I'VE GOT TO BE OFF THIS THING. A FEW YEARS AGO A TEENAGED CLIMBER FROM MICHIGAN SLIPPED ON A WET PATCH OF SIMILAR ROCK ON A NEARBY MOUNTAIN. HE FELL AND BROKE HIS ANKLE. ALONE AND UNABLE TO MOVE, HE ENDURED 11 DAYS OF AGONY BEFORE HE WAS RESCUED BY HELICOPTER. MANY CLIMBERS ARE NOT SO LUCKY, AND PEOPLE DIE IN THESE MOUNTAINS EVERY YEAR. ONE OF THE REAL DANGERS OF COMING DOWN ROCK LIKE THIS IS JUST ALL THESE FALSE HORIZONS. AND IT'S SO HARD TO SEE WHAT IS OVER THEM UNTIL YOU'RE COMMITTED. AND IT BECOMES VERY EASY TO CLIMB YOURSELF INTO A SITUATION WHERE YOU CAN'T GO UP OR DOWN. YEAH, THERE IS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF RISK INVOLVED IN DOING THIS SORT OF CLIMBING, AND IT'S VERY EASY TO TWIST OR INJURE YOUR ANKLE, ESPECIALLY SLIDING DOWN THESE SORT OF SLAB ROCKS. BUT I'VE MADE IT DOWN THE CLIFF, AND I'VE REACHED THE TREE LINE. IT'S TIME TO HAVE ANOTHER LOOK FOR SOME WATER. REMEMBER, YOU MUST MAKE SURE IT'S FREE OF THE PARASITES WHICH CAUSE DISEASES LIKE DYSENTERY AND GIARDIA. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE THE WATER IN THIS STREAM SAFE TO DRINK. IF YOU'RE REALLY DESPERATE AND YOU'VE GOT NO WAY OF BOILING THIS WATER, ONE THING YOU CAN DO TO FILTER IT TO MAKE SURE THE WATER YOU'RE DRINKING DOESN'T HAVE THIS GIARDIA IS TO DIG A LITTLE TRENCH JUST ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE WATER. AND IF I -- I'LL DIG HERE. I'LL GET A STONE OUT. AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS AS YOU GET DOWN BELOW THAT WATER LEVEL, WATER WILL SEEP THROUGH THE GRAVEL AND THE SAND, AND THAT GRAVEL AND SAND WILL CLEAN IT. AND THE WATER THAT COMES IN IS BROWN AND MURKY, BUT IT IS CLEAN. AND THIS GIARDIA PARASITE IS A REALLY NASTY ONE. IT CAN GIVE YOU REALLY BAD DIARRHEA AND VOMITING, AND IT CAN PUT YOU OUT OF ACTION FOR UP TO TWO WEEKS. AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS A BIT OF AN EFFORT DOING THIS, IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH IT. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS LOOKS QUITE MUDDY AND DIRTY, WHICH IT IS, AT LEAST I KNOW IT'S FILTERED. AHH, THAT'S SO NICE. MY NEXT CHALLENGE IS LITERALLY STAYING AFLOAT IN THE FAST-FLOWING WATER AND TRYING AS BEST AS I CAN TO NEGOTIATE THESE RAPIDS. [ GRUNTS ] I'M IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAIN RANGE IN CALIFORNIA -- 400 MILES OF SOME OF THE MOST RUGGED TERRAIN IN NORTH AMERICA. EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF VISITORS GET LOST OR INJURED HERE. SOME DIE. I'VE PROBABLY TRAVELED 2,000 FEET DOWN NOW, AND ONE OF THE FASTEST WAYS DOWN ANY MOUNTAIN IS TO FOLLOW A STREAM. BUT YOU MUST BE CAREFUL. MANY RIVERS IN THE SIERRAS ARE FAMOUS FOR THEIR WATERFALLS AND STEEP CANYONS. RIVERS ARE OFTEN THE KEY FOR GETTING OUT OF TROUBLE. THIS AREA WAS ONCE HOME TO MANY NATIVE AMERICANS. I'M USING SOME OF THEIR SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES TO TURN THIS DRIFTWOOD INTO A RAFT. BUILDING A RAFT TAKES TIME, SO I'LL BE GETTING SOME HELP FROM THE CREW. WHEN IT GETS WATERLOGGED IT'S GONNA GET HEAVIER, BUT CERTAINLY FOR A WHILE THIS SHOULD KEEP ME AFLOAT. BUT THE MAIN THING WITH BUILDING RAFTS, FROM MY EXPERIENCE, IS TO KEEP THEM SIMPLE. AND WHENEVER I TRY AND MAKE A RAFT TOO COMPLICATED, IT'S OFTEN FALLEN APART. BUT THIS IS JUST GONNA BE STURDY AND SIMPLE. AND I'VE GOT FIVE OR SIX OF THESE BIG, SOLID ONES AND THEN A COUPLE OF CROSS BRACES. AND THE IDEA IS, THEN, TO LASH ALL THIS TOGETHER, BUT I NEED SOMETHING TO LASH IT WITH. WILD GRAPEVINES LIKE THIS GROW ALL THE WAY ALONG THESE BANKS, AND THIS STUFF WOULD JUST BE IDEAL, JUST 'CAUSE IT'S REALLY STRONG AND REALLY FLEXIBLE. [ GRUNTS ] AND ALL OF THIS GRAPEVINE IS EDIBLE. EVEN THE LEAVES OF THIS ARE PACKED FULL OF GOOD NUTRIENTS. AND THE WAY TO DO THIS IS JUST TO -- ONCE YOU'VE MADE ALL THIS VINE NICE AND FLEXIBLE, JUST THEN DOUBLE IT ON ITSELF, PUT THAT THROUGH IT... AND TWIST IT A FEW TIMES. THIS IS AN OLD MONO INDIAN TECHNIQUE. BASICALLY IT'S LIKE WEAVING. AND YOU GET THE VINE AND TURN IT ONCE, TWIST IT, AND THEN GRAB ONE END AND SLIP THAT 'ROUND THE NEXT LOG, AND THEN DO EXACTLY THE SAME AGAIN. AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT DOING THIS -- AS THIS GETS WET, ALL OF THESE HITCH KNOTS WILL TIGHTEN ON THEMSELVES, AND IT MAKES ALL THIS WEAVING, HOPEFULLY, STRONG, FLEXIBLE, BUT TIGHT, AND WILL HOLD ALL THESE LOGS TOGETHER. OKAY, TIME FOR ITS FIRST OFFICIAL FIELD TEST. AND IT'S KIND OF MORE OR LESS HOLDING TOGETHER. AND NOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUST DO THE SAME ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE, PUT THIS LAST CROSS BRACE ON, AND THEN I SHOULD BE READY TO GO. THESE WATERS ARE USED FOR WHITE-WATER RAFTING, BUT THEY CAN BE LETHAL. ON A SINGLE RIVER IN THESE MOUNTAINS, THE LIVES OF 234 RAFTERS HAVE BEEN LOST IN THE LAST 30 YEARS. THE RIVER IS MOVING AT A GOOD PACE. I'M COVERING FAR MORE DISTANCE THAN I WOULD HIKING ACROSS LAND. TO BE SAFE, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS PROCEED DOWNRIVER WITH AN EASY ROUTE TO SHORE. THAT'S EASIER SAID, THOUGH, THAN DONE. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH A RAFT IS THAT YOU HAVE NO WAY OF STEERING. ALL YOU CAN DO IS KICK YOUR LEGS TO AVOID THE LARGER ROCKS. AND THEN JUST HANG ON. AND THESE SHALLOW BITS ARE ALWAYS NASTY. I'M GETTING BOUNCED ON THE ROCKS, AND MY KNEES ARE TAKING A REAL POUNDING HERE. IT'S BEGINNING TO GET MUCH COLDER NOW IN THESE CANYONS NOW THAT THE SUN'S DIPPED DOWN. THE RIVER IS JUST SLOWLY BUILDING UP SPEED... WITH EVERY LITTLE TURN. AND I CAN SEE THE RAPIDS AHEAD HERE, AND I JUST HOPE THIS THING STAYS TOGETHER. THESE RAPIDS APPEAR ENDLESS. AS SOON AS I'M THROUGH ONE, THERE'S ANOTHER AND THEN ANOTHER, AND THEY'RE GRADUALLY GETTING WORSE. AND HERE'S SOME MORE RAPIDS HERE. WE'RE TRYING TO AIM FOR THIS TONGUE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER I CAN HOLD ON. I JUST HAVE TO STAY ON THIS THING. IF YOU END UP IN THE WATER AND CAN'T GET BACK ON, YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I'VE BEEN RAFTING IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS. AND THE WATER IS FREEZING COLD. IF YOU LOSE YOUR RAFT, DON'T WASTE TIME TRYING TO RECOVER IT. YOUR PRIORITY IS TO GET OUT OF THE WATER. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] I CAN USE THIS OVERHANG HERE JUST AS A BIT OF SHELTER. AND THEN I REALLY NEED TO GET A FIRE GOING AND GET WARM QUICKLY. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] GO ON. TAKE. STRIKING A HARD ROCK AGAINST MY PIECE OF FLINT, I EVENTUALLY GET A FIRE GOING. YEAH, IN LIKE 10 MINUTES THE LIGHT IS JUST COMPLETELY GONE, AND YOU FEEL THIS COLD SUDDENLY PENETRATE EVERYWHERE, YOU KNOW, WHEN THAT SUN GOES. BUT WITH THIS FIRE, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO AT LEAST GET DRY AND... GET SOME WARMTH BACK. PERHAPS NOW I CAN SNATCH A FEW HOURS' SLEEP. IT'S 5:00 IN THE MORNING, DAWN IN THE SIERRAS, 400 MILES OF BREATHTAKING MOUNTAINS THAT RUN THROUGH CALIFORNIA. I'M HEADING DOWN THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. BUT FIRST, BREAKFAST, AND LIKE ANY TRUE ENGLISHMAN, I LIKE A HOT CUP OF TEA. I'VE BREWED THIS ONE WITH PINE NEEDLES. AT ALTITUDE, THE BODY USES UP FAR MORE LIQUID THAN AT SEA LEVEL, SO YOU NEED TO DRINK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. IF YOU'RE LOST AND DON'T HAVE A CUP OR A WAY TO DRINK WATER, YOU CAN STILL USE PINE NEEDLES TO GET MOISTURE. NORMALLY YOU'LL GET DEW ON THE LEAVES, AND THE SUN'S ONLY BEEN UP UNDER AN HOUR, AND ALREADY ALL OF THIS IS JUST BONE-DRY. NEEDLES ARE A GREAT SOURCE OF MOISTURE AND RETAIN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WATER. THEY'RE ALSO A STRONG SOURCE OF VITAMIN C -- AMAZINGLY, UP TO EIGHT TIMES HIGHER THAN ORANGE JUICE. AND NOW FOR SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL TO EAT. PINE TREES CAN PROVIDE THAT, TOO, BUT ONLY IF YOU CAN THROW. OH! I HIT IT! EVEN WHEN YOU HIT IT, IT DOESN'T ALWAYS FALL. AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS AFTER -- ONE OF THE YOUNG SUGAR PINECONES. IF YOU SPLIT THIS AND THEN PEEL ONE OF THESE LEAVES OUT, YOU GET TO THESE NUTS IN THE MIDDLE. AND THEY'RE PRETTY SMALL. BUT THERE YOU GO. SEE THAT LITTLE WHITE THING? CONES THAT HAVE DROPPED TO THE GROUND HAVE USUALLY LOST THEIR PINE NUTS. SO YOU HAVE TO GET ONES THAT ARE STILL IN THE TREES. I'M NOT SURE THEY WERE WORTH ALL THE EFFORT OF FINDING ALL THOSE ROCKS AND THROWING THEM. I'VE BURNED UP MORE CALORIES THAN I'M GETTING FROM THESE LITTLE THINGS, BUT THESE ARE REALLY GOOD NUTRITION. A LOT OF EFFORT FOR NOT MUCH FOOD. BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S AN EASIER WAY OF GETTING FOOD, AND THAT'S BY EATING ANY INSECTS YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS ON. I MIGHT FIND SOME GRUBS OR LITTLE BEETLES IN HERE. BUT LOOK -- IT'S JUST ALL SO CRUMBLY AND DRY, AND THERE'S JUST NO SIGN OF -- THERE'S JUST NO SIGNS OF ANYTHING HERE. I NEED TO KEEP HEADING DOWN, AND IT'S ALWAYS SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE DIRECTION YOU'RE HEADING. AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY A TEENAGED GIRL SCOUT WHO RECENTLY CAME OUT, LOST HER BEARINGS, AND SHE WAS LOST FOR TWO DAYS IN THE END. THE GIRL SCOUT, JUST 15 YEARS OLD, WAS FOUND NEAR HERE. SHE HAD WANDERED FOR 10 MILES OF FREEZING WINTER TEMPERATURES BEFORE RESCUERS SPOTTED HER. I KNOW THAT THE SUN ROSE OVER THERE THIS MORNING, IN THE EAST -- I WATCHED IT COME UP. I NEED TO BE HEADING WEST, BUT I DO NEED TO HEAD DOWNHILL. BUT THE OPTIONS FOR FOOD ARE PRETTY LIMITED OUT HERE, AND I'M SURE THAT WHATEVER I FIND WON'T BE ON ANY RESTAURANT MENU. I'M IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAIN RANGE IN CALIFORNIA. TO SURVIVE IN THE WILD, YOU NEED TO EAT LITTLE AND OFTEN. NOW, WHAT'S ON THE MENU? LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND THESE LITTLE WATER SNAKES. PEOPLE ARE OFTEN SCARED OF SNAKES, THINK THEY'RE NASTY, AGGRESSIVE REPTILES, BUT THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE ACTUALLY SO SHY. HERE WE GO. THESE SNAKES OFTEN EXCRETE A FOUL-SMELLING LIQUID TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST PREDATORS. AND...THAT IS HIS LITTLE MOUTH. AND AS LONG AS I BITE OFF THE HEAD, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO EAT THE WHOLE BODY OF THIS. HIS HEAD'S STILL MOVING. IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL HERE, BUT LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING. THERE ARE PLANTS HERE WHICH CAN KILL YOU AND OTHERS WHICH CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE. THIS STUFF HERE IS WHAT'S CALLED YARROW, OR THE PLANT OF A THOUSAND LEAVES. BUT THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR HEALING WOUNDS. IT ACTS AS LIKE AN ANTISEPTIC. AND ALSO, IT'S HEMOSTATIC, WHICH MEANS IT WILL HELP THE BLOOD TO ACTUALLY CLOT. AND THE STORY ACTUALLY GOES THAT ACHILLES USED YARROW ON HIS TROOPS AFTER THEY'D ALL BEEN STABBED AND MASHED TO BITS. BUT THEY'D USE THIS TO HELP HEAL THE WOUNDS. AND, ACTUALLY, LOOK OVER HERE, WHILST WE'RE ON AN ANCIENT-HISTORY THEME, THIS IS HEMLOCK, AND THIS IS ACTUALLY WHAT, I THINK IT WAS SOCRATES WAS POISONED ON -- POISONED HIMSELF ON HEMLOCK. AND IF I JUST HAD A BITE OF THAT, SWALLOWED IT, AND DIGESTED IT, THIS STUFF COULD KILL ME IN UNDER AN HOUR. AND SO, YOU DON'T WANT TO BE PUTTING THIS IN YOUR SOUP. BUT IT'S LIKE NATURE ON ONE SIDE GIVES YOU EVERYTHING TO HEAL YOU AND THEN JUST LIKE A METER AWAY, THIS HEMLOCK CAN KILL YOU. BUT THERE ARE OTHER PLANTS HERE WHICH YOU CAN SAFELY EAT. AND THIS PLANT HERE IS A BRODIAEA. AND IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS AN INDIAN POTATO. AND THE MONO INDIANS WOULD DIG AT THESE TO GET AT THE ROOTS, AND THEY HAVE THESE BULBS ON THEM THAT -- THERE WE GO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT. ...THESE WHITE BULBS THAT ARE A REALLY GOOD STARCHY CARBOHYDRATE FOOD, AND THIS GROUND IS QUITE NICE AND SOFT WHERE I CAN JUST DIG THIS OUT. IF IT WAS TOUGHER, YOU COULD USE A DIGGING STICK TO GET AT IT. BUT IF I BREAK...THE BULB OFF, YOU CAN SEE WHAT I MEAN. AND IF I JUST PEEL THE DIRT OFF IT, YOU GET THIS REALLY NICE WHITE...BULB UNDERNEATH. AND THAT IS REALLY GOOD FOOD. YOU'D NORMALLY COOK THIS, BUT THIS IS GREAT RAW. UM...IT KIND OF TASTES A BIT LIKE RAW LETTUCE, YOU KNOW? BUT IT'S REALLY ACTUALLY -- THESE ARE REALLY FILLING. IF YOU HAD A FEW OF THESE, FILL YOU UP, AND IT'S GOOD CARBOHYDRATE ENERGY. COULD DO WITH A BIT OF VINAIGRETTE ON IT. BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE OUT HERE, YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE A GOOD CAMP. WITH SOME HELP FROM THE CREW, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO BUILD A WICKI -- A TRADITIONAL NATIVE-AMERICAN SHELTER. I CAN JUST USE STRIPS OF THIS DEAD FIR AS...AS SECTIONS OF THE TRIFORM. THAT WOULD BE FOR ONE. AND THAT'S ABOUT EIGHT FOOT. THAT WILL DO. AND I'M GONNA HAVE ONE SIDE OF IT SHORTER THAN THE OTHER, BUT THAT STILL SHOULD DO. THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO BUILD THIS WICKIUP. AND...THIS WILL DO. IT'S PRETTY FLAT. THE SLIGHT DEPRESSION HERE IS GONNA STOP YOU FROM ROLLING DOWNHILL. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT JUST TO CHECK THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY GAME TRAILS MOVING THROUGH WHERE YOU WANT TO SLEEP, AND ALSO NO RED ANTS. FINAL THING I WANT TO CHECK FOR IS HAVING A BIT OF OPEN SKY ABOVE ME. SO IF SEARCH AND RESCUE IS LOOKING FOR YOU, THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE YOU. AND I'M GONNA LAY THEM IN A WAY SO I LEAVE A LITTLE GAP THIS SIDE IS GONNA BE MY DOOR, AND IT'S GONNA BE SOUTH FACING, SO I'LL GET THE SUN FROM THE SOUTHEAST FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. AND IT SHOULD BE NICE AND WARM, AS WELL. MY NEXT CHALLENGE IS TO USE A NATIVE-AMERICAN THROWING STICK TO SHOW YOU HOW TO GET SOME REAL FOOD. AND THAT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. WHOO-HOO! I'M IN THE SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS IN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE PUT MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF A STRANDED CLIMBER OR HIKER. NOW FOR DINNER, AND ENOUGH OF GRUBS AND SNAKES. IT'S TIME TO GO FOR SOMETHING HIGHER UP THE FOOD CHAIN. THIS HERE IS PERFECT TERRAIN FOR THE HUNTER. IT'S THIS TRANSITION PHASE WHERE THE TREES GO INTO THE MEADOW. AND ANIMALS LOVE THIS 'CAUSE THEY HAVE THE SHELTER, THEY HAVE THE GRASSES IN THE MEADOW, AND THEY HAVE WATER IN THE STREAMS. AND, REALLY, I WANT TO TRY AND SEE IF I CAN GET MYSELF SOMETHING TO EAT. THERE ARE GONNA BE LOADS OF DEER AND RABBITS AND SQUIRRELS AND GOPHER AND MICE AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS IN THIS PART OF THE FOREST. I'M GRINDING THIS PIECE OF CEDAR INTO AN INDIAN THROWING STICK. NATIVE AMERICANS CHOOSE CEDAR BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST WOODS AND MAKES FOR A PERFECT WEAPON. SMOOTHING IT DOWN LIKE THIS WILL MAKE IT FAST AND DEADLY IN THE AIR. WE'RE READY FOR SOME PRACTICE. A RABBIT OR SQUIRREL IS NOT IN ANY GREAT DANGER AT THE MOMENT. IF YOU'RE LUCKIER THAN ME AND YOU'VE GOT A RABBIT, YOU CAN START A FIRE WITHOUT EVEN A FLINT. USING A LOCAL TECHNIQUE, WHICH SHALL BE SHOWN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BRANCH OF THIS ELDERBERRY, THIS IS REALLY LONG AND THIN. AND THIS ACTUALLY GIVES ME A WHOLE NOTHER WAY OF MAKING FIRE... ...WHICH I CAN USE LATER. I'M JUST SCRAPING THIS LAST LITTLE BIT OF SHAVINGS OUT OF THE INNER BARK OF THE CEDAR SO I CAN ADD TO THIS TINDER BUNDLE. AND THIS IS A VITAL BIT OF A FIRE. I WANT TO REALLY BREAK THIS UP AND GET IT REALLY LIGHT AND FLUFFY. AND IT'S THIS THAT I'M EVENTUALLY GONNA TIP THE EMBERS INTO HERE TO TRY AND GET THE FLAME GOING. BUT NOW THIS IS THE MEAT OF IT -- TRYING TO GET THE EMBER TO SPARK THIS. AND ALL I'M USING IS THIS LITTLE BRANCH THAT I GOT OFF THE ELDERBERRY BUSH AND THIS LITTLE BIT OF BASE WOOD. AND THIS ALWAYS REQUIRES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PATIENCE. TO MAKE AN EMBER, FRICTION MUST HEAT THE ELDERBERRY BRANCH TO 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. AND ONCE IT SMOKES LIKE THIS, I NEED JUST TO KEEP IT GOING FOR A COUPLE MORE GOES, AND THEN I'LL HAVE A COAL. YOU CAN SEE IT JUST COMING OUT OF THE NOTCH THERE. HERE WE GO. IT'S SMOKING. NOW I'M GONNA PUT THAT STRAIGHT INTO THE BUNDLE. AND HERE WE GO. GET THAT IN THERE. WE'VE GOT HOLD OF A RABBIT, SO I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO COOK IT IN THE WILD. AND ALL WE NEED TO DO NOW -- 'CAUSE THE NECK'S ALREADY BROKEN, THAT COMES AWAY ALMOST IN ONE BIT. BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT UNWELCOME GUESTS CRASHING THE BARBECUE. THIS IS BEGINNING TO COOK AND SMELL REALLY GOOD NOW. BUT I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S GONNA BE ABLE TO SMELL THIS. AND LOCAL BLACK BEARS IN THIS AREA CAN SMELL THIS UP TO 25 MILES AWAY. AND I'VE ACTUALLY GOT A FRIEND WHO WAS OUT CAMPING IN ONE OF THESE YOSEMITE VALLEYS. HE WENT TO SLEEP, AND HE HAD AN APPLE INSIDE HIS TROUSERS POCKET. AND HE USED HIS TROUSERS AS A PILLOW. AND HE WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT WITH A BLACK BEAR RIPPING THE TROUSERS OUT FROM UNDER HIS HEAD JUST TO GET AT THE APPLE. BUT HE WAS LUCKY. BUT IT JUST SHOWS HOW CAREFUL YOU'VE GOT TO BE WHEN YOU'RE COOKING, PREPARING, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY GETTING RID OF ANY EXCESS FOOD THAT YOU DON'T USE WHEN YOU GO TO SLEEP. THIS LOOKS DONE NOW. AND I'VE JUST BEEN SITTING HERE DROOLING OVER THIS. [ BLOWING ] TIME TO TRY IT. MMM. WOW. MMM. IT JUST TASTES SO FRESH, AND COOKED OVER THIS FIRE IT'S JUST SO DELICIOUS, LIKE STRAIGHT OFF A BARBECUE. IT'S AN UNBELIEVABLY BEAUTIFUL NIGHT, AND YOU CAN SEE THE STARS JUST SO CLEARLY. AND YOU CAN SEE THE NORTH STAR OVER THERE, THE POLARIS. AND IT'S NOT THE BRIGHTEST STAR, BUT IT'S ONE OF THE ONLY CONSTANT STARS IN THE SKY. YOU CAN NAVIGATE BY IT. IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE, AND I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO -- WHILE I CAN SEE IT, I'M GONNA MARK IT I'VE REACHED THE REGION OF THE MOUNTAINS KNOWN AS THE CHAPARRAL, A SPANISH NAME FOR A HOT AND ARID AREA OF SCRUBLAND WHERE FEW ANIMALS CAN SURVIVE. THIS IS THE MOST EXTREME REGION OF THE WESTERN SIERRA NEVADA MOUNTAINS. THIS LANDSCAPE IS ALSO HOME TO DEADLY SCORPIONS AND BITING, STINGING ANTS... THOUGH THE ANTS CAN MAKE A TASTY SNACK. Grylls: AND THIS IS WHY YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO GRAB THEM BY THE HEAD. IF YOU LOOK -- IF I LET IT BITE MY TONGUE -- AAH -- OW -- IT BITES ON, AND THAT'S WHY YOU EAT THE OTHER END. THE MOST DIFFICULT PART IS CATCHING THEM. YOU CAN SEE THE ABDOMEN THERE, AND YOU CAN EAT THAT. AND THAT'S KIND OF REALLY TANGY AND SWEET, BUT SURPRISINGLY QUITE GOOD. AFTER A TASTY SNACK OF CARPENTER ANTS, I PUSH ON. I WANT TO MAKE QUICK PROGRESS BEFORE THE HEAT OF THE DAY REALLY KICKS IN. BUT THIS HOT TERRAIN HAS A NEW THREAT -- SNAKES. THIS IS ALSO PRIME SNAKE COUNTRY AROUND HERE, AND YOU'LL GET RATTLESNAKES AND BULL AND KING SNAKES. BUT RATTLESNAKES ARE THE ONES YOU REALLY WANT TO WATCH OUT FOR. ACTUALLY, THIS IS JUST A PRIME PLACE FOR SNAKES, ESPECIALLY IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY. WHEN IT'S HOT, THEY WANT TO FIND SHADE AND TUCK THEMSELVES UNDER HERE. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU CROSS LOGS ALWAYS TO STAND ON TOP OF IT AND HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE, AND THEN MOVE. THIS TIME OF DAY IS VERY HOT, AND HIKING THROUGH THIS SCRUBLAND IS THIRSTY WORK. IT WAS ONLY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT A LONE HIKER BECAME LOST NEAR HERE. FOR NINE DAYS, THE SEARCH PARTY LOOKED FOR HIM IN VAIN. WHEN HE FINALLY STAGGERED OUT, HE WAS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE DEHYDRATION. BUT THERE'S ONE PLANT OUT HERE THAT COULD HAVE HELPED HIM. AH, THIS SORT OF BUSH IS IDEAL. I'M NOT GONNA GET A FEAST OUT OF IT, BUT IT'S A LITTLE MANZANITA BUSH, AND IT LITERALLY MEANS "LITTLE APPLES," AND YOU CAN SEE THESE THINGS. THE MONO INDIANS WOULD USE THESE A LOT JUST AS DRIED FRUIT, AND ALL YOU DO IS CHEW THE OUTER BIT OF IT AND THEN SPIT OUT THE HARD SEED. BUT THESE ARE REALLY HIGH IN VITAMIN C, AND THEY'RE GREAT, AND THEY'LL ALSO MAKE DRINKS OUT OF THIS. THEY GET LOADS OF THESE BERRIES AND CRUSH THEM UP, ADD WATER, AND STRAIN IT THROUGH A BASKET, AND IT GIVES THIS REALLY NICE, LEMONY DRINK. THE BUSH IS ALSO GOOD FOR SOMETHING ELSE -- CLEANING YOUR TEETH. AND THE MANZANITA BUSH WAS USED BY NATIVE AMERICANS AS A FORM OF TOOTHBRUSH, AND THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING, TOO. SO, THIS BUSH CAN BE REALLY USEFUL. IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT IT'S ABOUT ONE OF THE FEW BUSHES IN THIS SORT OF TERRAIN THAT CAN BE A HELP. BY MIDAFTERNOON, THE HEAT FROM THE SUN CAN BE OVERPOWERING. IT SLOWS YOUR PROGRESS THROUGH THE UNFORGIVING SCRUB, BUT THE SCRUB DOESN'T LAST FOREVER. THAT IS AMAZING! WHAH! THAT'S A HUGE LAKE! AHH! OH. OH, IT'S SO GOOD. THE LAKE IS HALF A MILE ACROSS, AND IF YOU HAVE TO SWIM THAT DISTANCE, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO USE YOUR TROUSERS TO KEEP YOU AFLOAT. AND ALL I'VE GOT TO DO WITH THESE IS GRAB THE TROUSER LEGS AND TIE A KNOT IN IT. AND I USED TO DO THIS LOADS WHEN I WAS A KID, MAKING RAFTS AND STUFF TO CROSS RIVERS. BUT ALL YOU DO IS TIE THESE KNOTS TO TRAP THE AIR, AND THEN WHEN I SWING THEM OVER MY HEAD INTO THE WATER, THEY'LL ACT LIKE A LITTLE LIFE JACKET. MY MAKESHIFT LIFE JACKET ISN'T THAT RELIABLE. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING YOU CAN DO -- TRY TO REFILL IT WITH AIR WHILST TREADING WATER. BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY. FINALLY I MAKE IT ACROSS. THIS TERRAIN HAS BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE. JUST BECAUSE OF THE RANGE OF DIFFERENT CONDITIONS I'VE COME ACROSS, EVERYTHING FROM THE HIGH-ALTITUDE SNOW LINE THROUGH TO THE BURNING HEAT. IT'S MEANT THAT I'VE CONSTANTLY HAD TO ADAPT THE TECHNIQUES JUST TO SURVIVE. AND SO MANY OF THE SKILLS OF THE MONO INDIANS HAVE BEEN SO HELPFUL FOR ME OUT HERE. AND IT JUST SHOWS HOW RESOURCEFUL THOSE GUYS HAD TO BE TO SURVIVE IN THIS SORT OF LANDSCAPE. BUT I LEAVE THIS PLACE WITH A WHOLE NEW RESPECT FOR NATIVE AMERICANS AND THEIR EXTRAORDINARY SURVIVAL SKILLS. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
