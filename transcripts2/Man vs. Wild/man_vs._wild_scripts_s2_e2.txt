 THE NOMADIC BERBER TRIBES HAVE LIVED HERE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, AND THEY'RE GONNA SHOW ME IN THIS SPECIAL EPISODE SOME OF THEIR MOST EXTREME SURVIVAL TECHNIQUES -- HOW A DEAD CAMEL CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE... GET INSIDE IT, PULL IT OVER. ...HOW THEY PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THEIR VERY WORST ENEMIES... FEAST ON THINGS THAT WILL TURN YOUR STOMACH... I'VE NEVER EATEN RAW GOAT'S TESTICLES BEFORE. ...AND CLIMB MY WAY OUT OF THE DESERT. I'M FLYING ACROSS THE SAHARA IN MOROCCO, THE BIGGEST DESERT IN THE WORLD, WITH 3.5 MILLION SQUARE MILES.

 IT'S ABOUT THE SAME SIZE AS THE U.S. THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS ARE YOUR ONLY WAY OUT OF THE DESERT, BUT THEY'RE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY, SO YOU'LL NEED TO USE EVERY TRICK IN THE BOOK TO SURVIVE. I'VE GOT A FEW BASIC TOOLS, AND MY CAMERA CREW ARE COMING WITH ME. I'M ABOUT 15 FEET ABOVE THE HIGHEST DUNE, AND I'M GONNA USE AN OLD ARMY TECHNIQUE TO JUMP OUT, KEEPING MY KNEES AND FEET TOGETHER. IT'S NOT THE MOST CONVENTIONAL WAY TO LAND IN THE DESERT, BUT IT'S FUN. [ GRUNTS ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ SIGHS ] [ COUGHS ] THERE'S SAND EVERYWHERE. THAT WAS JUST LIKE A WHIRLWIND UP THERE. WHEW. OKAY. WE'RE OFF. THE DUNES ARE THE TOUGHEST KIND OF DESERT TO SURVIVE IN AND MAKE UP A QUARTER OF THE SAHARA. WATER IS YOUR BIGGEST PRIORITY, BUT THERE'S HARDLY A DROP HERE. BUT JUST THE TINIEST MORSEL OF FOOD CAN HELP. COME ON. YOU SEE THAT? A LITTLE SAND BEETLE. AND WHEN THERE'S AS LITTLE FOOD AS THERE IS IN THE SAHARA DESERT, THIS IS ABOUT AS GOOD AS YOU'RE GONNA GET. BUT THESE ARE PRETTY COMMON IN THE DUNES. [ GROANS ] DON'T TASTE VERY NICE. AH, BUT IT'S GONNA GIVE ME A GOOD BIT OF PROTEIN AND A BIT OF SALT. [ CRUNCHING ] [ GROANS ] TASTES LIKE A... PRAWN THAT'S FULL OF SAND, BEEN SITTING AROUND FOR ABOUT A MONTH, FULL OF CHEESE. [ SPITS ] OH, GOD. ANYWAY, AT LEAST IT'S SOMETHING. IT WILL ALSO REPLACE ANY SALTS YOU'VE LOST THROUGH SWEATING. AND OUT HERE, YOU CAN LOSE A LITER AN HOUR WITHOUT EVEN NOTICING IT. ONE OF THE DANGERS OF THE SAHARAN WIND IS THAT IT'S EXCEPTIONALLY DRYING, AND AS SOON AS YOU SWEAT, THE WIND HITS IT, AND YOU'RE DRY. AND THEN YOU SWEAT AGAIN. AND THAT'S WHY YOU DEHYDRATE OUT HERE SO FAST. IN THIS BLISTERING HEAT, WITHOUT ANY WATER, YOU CAN BE DEAD WITHIN 24 HOURS. IF YOU WERE LOST OUT HERE, YOUR ONE REAL CHANCE OF SURVIVAL WOULD LIE WITH THE BERBERS. THEY'VE LIVED NEAR THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, AND THEY'RE THE ULTIMATE EXPERTS IN DESERT SURVIVAL. DO YOU SEE THEIR CAMP AROUND THE ACACIA TREE THERE? WHAT I REALLY NEED IS JUST A DRINK. THEY HAVE RESCUED PLENTY OF PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS, AND I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET THEM. BONJOUR. BONJOUR. çA VA? çA VA. MOHAMMED SPEAKS FRENCH BECAUSE THIS AREA WAS ONCE A FRENCH COLONY. AS HE KNOWS ONLY TOO WELL, WATER IN THE DESERT IS LIFE. AND THE FIRST GIFT FOR ANY VISITOR IS TO GIVE THEM A MUCH-NEEDED DRINK. MERCI BIEN. WHEW. EVERY DAY, THEY SWEEP THEIR CAMPS FOR SNAKES. OBVIOUSLY, THEY'VE GOT KIDS, THEIR KIDS PLAYING AROUND THE TENT. AND THEY'VE GOT THEIR CAMELS THAT REALLY ARE THEIR LIVELIHOOD, AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO BE LOSING THOSE TO SNAKE BITES. SO, MOHAMMED'S GONNA TAKE ME OUT AND SHOW ME HOW THEY DO THEIR SNAKE HUNTS. THE WHOLE AREA IS HOME TO HORNED VIPERS, THE SAHARA'S MOST FEARSOME SNAKE. AND THEY ARE A CONSTANT MENACE. HE KNOWS OF ONE GUY WHO HAS A YOUNG BOY, AGE 15, LOOKING AFTER THE CAMELS OUT HERE. AND ONE MORNING, THE CAMEL WENT DOWN, HE GOT OFF, AND HE WAS PUTTING SOMETHING AROUND THE LEG OF THE CAMEL. AND AS HE REACHED DOWN, A VIPER BIT THIS BOY'S FINGER. OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO HOSPITAL OUT HERE. THERE'S NO ANTIVENOM, NO MEDICINE. AND THEY HAD TO, STRAIGHT THEN AND THERE, JUST CUT THE FINGER OFF TO SAVE HIS LIFE. THAT'S HOW DANGEROUS THESE SNAKES CAN BE AND HOW CAREFUL YOU'VE GOT TO BE WHEN YOU'RE WALKING THROUGH ALL THIS STUFF. HORNED VIPERS ARE NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO CATCH. THEY'RE NOT JUST WELL-CAMOUFLAGED, BUT THEY BURROW UNDER THE SAND, AND THEY'RE EASILY STEPPED ON AND ARE ALL TOO READY TO STRIKE. AND THEY'LL OFTEN BE IN, LIKE, THESE LITTLE CLUSTERS HERE OR EVEN JUST BURIED IN THE SAND. BUT WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR, REALLY, ARE JUST THE SLITHER TRACES OF WHERE THE SNAKE'S BEEN. MOHAMMED'S GOT SOME TRACKS HERE. YOU CAN SEE, THAT'S A VERY DISTINCT SHAPE. YOU CAN EVEN SEE -- LOOK, YOU CAN EVEN SEE THE SCALES ON THIS. I SEE HIM CURLED UNDER THERE. AND IF YOU CAN SEE RIGHT IN THERE, YOU CAN SEE THESE TWO LITTLE HORNS ON TOP OF ITS HEAD. AND THESE ARE ONE OF THE MOST DEADLY SNAKES IN THE WORLD. THAT CAN KILL YOU. THEY GROW UP TO 3 FOOT LONG. THEIR VENOM POISONS YOUR BLOOD SYSTEM AND CAN CAUSE MASSIVE HEMORRHAGING, LEADING TO A HEART ATTACK. THE BERBERS HAVE A HEALTHY RESPECT FOR THEM AND ALWAYS USE STICKS TO CATCH THEM. OKAY, GOT HIM. AND THERE YOU GO. YOU CAN JUST SEE THE HEAD THERE. BUT YOU WANT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL. EVEN AFTER YOU'VE TAKEN THE HEAD OFF, YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL. THAT'S STILL GOT ALL ITS HEMOTOXIC VENOM IN ITS MOUTH. AND YOU NEVER JUST WANT TO LEAVE A SNAKE'S HEAD OUT IN THE OPEN AFTER YOU'VE CUT IT OFF. YOU WANT TO EITHER BURN IT OR BURY IT. THE VENOM CAN STILL BE TOXIC 24 HOURS AFTER THE SNAKE HAS BEEN KILLED. LOOK, HE'S STILL... BODY'S STILL WRIGGLING AROUND. BOY, THIS IS A NASTY BRUTE AND A KILLER OF A SNAKE. BUT I'M GONNA EAT HIM. YOU JUST PEEL BACK THE SKIN, GUT IT... AND THAT'S ALL THE GUTS COMING OUT THE MIDDLE THERE. ...WRAP IT AROUND A STICK, AND COOK IT OVER THE FIRE. OKAY, LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THIS, MOHAMMED. AND A GOOD WAY OF TELLING WHETHER IT'S COOKED IS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THE STRANDS OF THE MEAT. YOU DON'T WANT TO BURN THIS 'CAUSE, ACTUALLY, IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL MEAT. [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] HE'S SAYING HE DOESN'T EAT THIS. IT'S REALLY TOUGH. BUT ALSO I KNOW THEY'RE REALLY SUPERSTITIOUS ABOUT SNAKES. AND THEY ACTUALLY CONSIDER, IF YOU KILL ONE, IT'S LIKE KILLING AN ENEMY. MERCI, MOHAMMED. [ SPEAKING FRENCH ] BON APPéTIT. MERCI. CAMELS ARE THE KEY TO BOTH WEALTH AND DESERT SURVIVAL FOR THE BERBERS, SO FINDING WATER IS CRUCIAL. EVERY BERBER HAS A MENTAL MAP OF JUST WHAT'S WHERE. AND THIS IS A REAL SKILL OF THESE BERBER FAMILIES. THIS KNOWLEDGE IS JUST PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION, OF KNOWING WHERE THESE WELLS ARE IN THE DESERT, THESE UNDERGROUND POCKETS OF WATER. AND IT'S THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT REALLY MEANS THESE GUYS ARE THE ULTIMATE SAHARA DESERT SURVIVORS. FOR THEIR MAIN SOURCE OF FOOD, THE BERBERS RELY ON GOATS. AND THIS ONE IS KILLED USING A TRADITIONAL METHOD. [ GOAT BLEATS ] AND REALLY, WITH SKINNING CARCASSES, YOU WANT TO TRY AND USE AS LITTLE KNIFE AS POSSIBLE. AND ONCE YOU'RE IN, YOU CAN JUST USE YOUR FIST, AND YOU, LIKE, ROLL IT. AND MOHAMMED'S KINDLY OFFERED TO HELP ME MAKE A WATER GOURD OUT OF THIS SKIN. SO WE'RE GONNA DRY THIS OVERNIGHT AND MAKE SOMETHING THAT I CAN CARRY WATER WITH WHEN I CARRY ON MY JOURNEY TOMORROW. NOTHING WILL GO TO WASTE. AND WHEN I SAY NOTHING, I MEAN NOTHING. HE'S GONNA CUT INTO THAT, AND THEN HE'S GONNA EAT ONE OF THEM. AND THEN, IN HONOR OF HIS GUEST, HE WANTS TO GIVE ME THE OTHER ONE. [ CLEARS THROAT ] IT'S TRADITIONAL FOR BERBER MEN TO EAT GOAT'S TESTICLES. THEY'RE THOUGHT TO ENHANCE FERTILITY, AND IT'S CERTAINLY GONNA BE A TEST OF MY MANHOOD. MERCI. MERCI. NO. I MUST SAY, I'VE NEVER... NEVER EATEN RAW GOAT'S TESTICLES BEFORE. MERCI, MOHAMMED. [ SQUISHING ] [ GAGS ] MMM. [ GAGS, COUGHS ] OKAY, MOHAMMED. SORRY ABOUT THAT. LET'S CARRY ON. I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT WITH THE BERBERS BEFORE VENTURING BACK OUT INTO THE ARID DESERT. [ MEN SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE ] I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW NIGHTS I'VE HAD IN THE WILD, AH, THAT IS JUST BLISS. YOU KNOW, I CAN REALLY AFFORD TO RELAX. I'VE HAD GOOD COMPANY WITH ALL OF THESE BERBER GUYS. I'VE HAVE FOOD. I'VE HAD WATER, EVEN SOME TEA. AND I'M JUST LYING, LOOKING AT THE STARS. THAT IS GOOD. AFTER BREAKFAST, IT'S TIME TO SAY GOODBYE. BUT THERE'S A PARTING GIFT FROM MOHAMMED, SOMETHING I'LL NEED FOR MY NEXT DESERT CHALLENGES. AH, THE WATER GOURD. THANKS, MOHAMMED. MERCI BIEN. WE'LL SEE YOU. AND IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF WATER IN IT. AND IF YOU HAD TO MAKE YOUR WAY OUT FROM HERE, YOUR BEST BET IS TO STILL KEEP HEADING TOWARDS THE ATLAS, AND THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO KEEP THE ACACIA TREES IN FRONT OF YOU. THEY TEND TO GROW TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS. AND THEN THE TAMARISK THAT LIKE THE DUNES, BEHIND YOU. MERCI. I'VE NOW BEEN CUT LOOSE BY THE BERBERS TO FEND FOR MYSELF IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S HARSHEST ENVIRONMENTS. BUT THEY'VE LEFT ME WITH THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE. THE BERBER HAVE GIVEN ME THIS CAMEL, AND THEY'LL ALMOST ALWAYS KILL AN OLD BEAST LIKE THIS WHEN IT'S ON ITS LAST LEGS, RATHER THAN LET IT SUFFER TOO MUCH. BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY'LL USE EVERY SINGLE BIT OF THIS ANIMAL, NOT ONLY, THOUGH, FOR FOOD, ALSO FOR WATER AND, IN EXTREMITY, FOR SHELTER. I'M GONNA START BY SKINNING THIS CAMEL FOR A BLANKET, AS I WANT TO SET UP CAMP BEFORE NIGHTFALL. I'VE GOT AROUND THREE HOURS TO DO IT. AND WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS GRAB A GOOD BIT OF SKIN... ...AND THEN JUST GET INTO IT. AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE IN, A GOOD WAY OF DOING IT IS PUTTING YOUR FINGER LIKE THAT, OVER THE KNIFE, 'CAUSE WHAT YOU WANT TO AVOID IS PUNCTURING THE ACTUAL GUTS. AND THEN JUST SLIDE IN. IT'S HARD WORK DOING IT IN THIS SEARING HEAT OF AROUND 130 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. AND I'M SWEATING BUCKETS. BUT THE HUMP MIGHT JUST HELP ME. AND THE BERBER ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT THE FAT FROM THIS IS A REAL DELICACY. BUT EXPERIENCE HAS TAUGHT ME TO BE A LITTLE BIT WARY OF BERBER DELICACIES. AND THIS IS JUST... PURE CAMEL FAT. [ GAGS, SPITS ] OH, MAN. THAT'S HORRIBLE. [ SPITS ] IN EXTREME SITUATIONS, THE FAT FROM THE HUMP OF A LIVING CAMEL WILL SAVE A BERBER'S LIFE. THEY CUT A FLAP OF SKIN AND FATTY HUMP AND CAREFULLY TAKE OUT WHAT THEY WANT, MAKING SURE THEY LEAVE ENOUGH FOR THE CAMEL TO SURVIVE. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS THE STOMACH. AND THE STOMACH, ITSELF, IS IN THREE PARTS SO IT CAN SEPARATE THE LIQUIDS FROM THE SOLIDS. AND THE BIT I WANT IS CALLED THE RUMEN, WHERE IT KEEPS THE FLUIDS. THERE WE GO. I'M THROUGH... [ INSECTS BUZZING ] ...TO THE INNARDS HERE. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S AMAZING. IT'S LIKE A RESERVOIR, THIS RUMEN WATER. AND A NOMAD TOLD ME ONCE HOW HIS UNCLE, IN THE 1950s, WAS LOST IN A SANDSTORM OUT HERE. AND HE ACTUALLY ENDED UP KILLING HIS CAMEL TO GET AT THE RUMEN AND ALL THIS FLUID INSIDE, AND THAT ACTUALLY SAVED HIS LIFE. IF YOU DON'T FIND MUCH WATER IN THE RUMEN, YOU MIGHT GET SOME FROM THE MAIN PART OF THE STOMACH, WHERE THE FOOD IS DIGESTED. [ GAGS, COUGHS ] GOT A LOAD OF STENCH... OF CAMEL-DIGESTED FOOD STRAIGHT UP MY NOSTRILS. AND HERE YOU GO. IF YOU BRING THE CAMERA OVER HERE AND LOOK INSIDE, YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING THAT IT'S BEEN EATING. AND THAT'S JUST PARTIALLY DIGESTED. [ GAGS ] AND THE FLUID IN THIS, AGAIN, IS DRINKABLE. THAT MUST HAVE HURT WHEN IT WENT DOWN HIS THROAT. [ SPITS ] [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] DRINKABLE, BUT TRULY... DISGUSTING. THERE ARE NO LESS THAN 200 FEET OF INTESTINES AND GUTS THAT I HAVE TO HAUL OUT. OKAY, IT'S ALL JUST BEING HELD ON AT ONE POINT NOW. I HAVE TO HOLD MY BREATH, GET IN THERE, AND CUT IT. WHEW, STINKS. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] UGH, I GOT IT! YOU NEED TO DRAG THIS LOT WELL AWAY FROM THE CARCASS, IN THE HOPE THAT PREDATORS LIKE JACKALS STAY AWAY. I DON'T WANT THEM BOTHERING ME WHEN I SLEEP OUT TONIGHT. ONE, TWO, THREE. NOW I NEED TO TURN THE CAMEL OVER TO SKIN THE OTHER SIDE. NEVER GOT MY LEG OVER WITH A CAMEL BEFORE... [ GRUNTING ] ...BUT I HAVE NOW. I'VE BEEN BUTCHERING NOW FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF, AND ALREADY, THE FLESH HAS VIRTUALLY COOKED IN THIS HEAT, AND THE SKIN IS ALREADY DRYING. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] AND THAT IS WHAT'S GONNA BE MY BLANKET TONIGHT. AND IF YOU COME AND HAVE A LOOK INSIDE THE CARCASS -- THE BERBERS COULD USE THIS AS AN EMERGENCY SHELTER IN A SANDSTORM. AND ALL THEY'D DO IS... GET INSIDE IT, PULL IT OVER... AND I'LL BE 100% PROTECTED FROM THE SAND. JACKALS MIGHT WELL BE ATTRACTED TO THE CARCASS, SO IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE MEAT AND MYSELF, I'M GONNA PEE AROUND IT TO DETER THEM. THAT'LL SORT 'EM OUT. IT'S WORTH KNOWING THAT IT ONLY WORKS WITH BLOKE'S PEE. IT DOESN'T WORK IF YOU'RE A WOMAN, 'CAUSE YOUR PEE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH TESTOSTERONE. SO, BAD LUCK, GIRLS. IF YOU NEED TO PEE LATER, JUST KEEP TOPPING UP YOUR LINE OF DEFENSE. AND NOW ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS TO MAKE MY BED. I CAN THEN LAY THIS DOWN. NOW I'VE GOT A PILLOW, SOMETHING TO KEEP ME OFF THE ROCKS AND KEEP ME WARM... IF I NEED TO. BEFORE BEDDING DOWN FOR WHAT'S PROBABLY SHAPING UP TO BE ONE OF MY LEAST-PLEASANT NIGHTS OUT UNDER THE STARS, I'M GONNA TRY AND GET A FIRE GOING TO COOK SOME MEAT. AND CAMEL DUNG IS PERFECT FUEL BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO DRY. AND ALL OF THIS IS JUST BEAUTIFUL, FRESH MEAT. AND YOU WON'T GET A BETTER-LOOKING STEAK THAN THAT. A FLAT STONE OVER THE FIRE IS THE DESERT VERSION OF A BARBECUE. I KEEP FEEDING THE CAMEL DUNG IN. CAMEL MEAT IS LOW IN CHOLESTEROL, AND THIS IS A RARE DESERT FEAST. I RECKON THIS SHOULD BE READY. I THINK IT WAS QUITE AN OLD CAMEL. AFTER THREE AND A HALF HOURS OF HARD WORK, WHAT I NEED NOW IS JUST TO REST AND RECHARGE MY BATTERIES FOR WHATEVER LIES AHEAD. BUT IF I KIND OF THINK BACK TO A LOT OF THE GREAT SURVIVAL STORIES I'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS, ONE THING THAT RUNS THROUGH THEM IS OFTEN THAT THOSE WHO SURVIVE NIGHTMARE SITUATIONS ARE THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED TO STEP OUTSIDE OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE AND DO WHATEVER THEY NEED TO TO MAKE IT BACK IN ONE PIECE AND MAKE IT HOME. AND AS A PILLOW, I'VE GOT A DEAD CAMEL'S NECK. I'D NEVER GET THIS ONE PAST THE WIFE. THIS IS GONNA BE ONE LONG NIGHT, AND TEMPERATURES HERE CAN PLUNGE TO FREEZING. [ GROANS ] WELL, IT'S ABOUT 6:00 IN THE MORNING, AND THE SUN'S JUST COMING UP. THANK GOD, 'CAUSE I AM REALLY COLD. AND IT'S AMAZING HOW COLD IT GETS AT NIGHT IN THE DESERT. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THIS, BUT I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE SUN. ALL OF THIS, NOW, IS JUST ONE GIANT SALT PAN, AND IT STRETCHES FOR MILES AND MILES IN EVERY DIRECTION. AND 10,000 YEARS AGO, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE SEA. BUT NOW IT'S JUST THIS CRUST OF, LIKE, GLISTENING SALT AND MINERALS. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO BRIGHT AND WHY IT'S SO SEARINGLY HOT HERE. IT'S 20x30 MILES, TOTALLY BARREN, TOTALLY EXPOSED, AND TOTALLY TOXIC. NOTHING GROWS. THERE'S NOT A DROP OF WATER. AND DON'T GET EXCITED BY THESE TIRE TRACKS. THIS PLACE ONLY BRIEFLY COMES ALIVE ONCE A YEAR, AND IT'S NOT NOW. THAT'S ALL FROM THE PARIS-DAKAR RALLY. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE LONGEST AND TOUGHEST RACES IN THE WORLD, AND IT PASSES ALL THE WAY THROUGH MOROCCO AND WESTERN SAHARA. AND THERE WAS ONE BIKER WHO CRASHED. HE SMASHED UP HIMSELF AND HIS BIKE, AND HE KNEW THEN HE WAS IN A LOT OF TROUBLE. BUT IT WAS ONLY 'CAUSE A BERBER FOUND HIM AND MANAGED TO HELP HIM THAT HE SURVIVED TO TELL THE TALE. HE WAS LUCKY TO BE RESCUED. BUT IF YOU'RE STRANDED OUT HERE ALONE, YOUR ONLY WAY OUT ARE THE FOOTHILLS OF THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS. THEY MAY LOOK CLOSE, BUT CROSSING EVEN SHORT DISTANCES IN THIS SALT PAN CAN KILL YOU. ON FLAT GROUND LIKE THIS, YOU CAN UNDERESTIMATE DISTANCE BY A FACTOR OF THREE. AND THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANY NEARER. IT'S A BLISTERING 130 DEGREES. IT'S PHYSICALLY DRAINING. BUT IT'S THE HAVOC THIS HEAT, HAZE, AND FLAT TERRAIN PLAYS WITH YOUR MIND THAT CAN KILL YOU. THAT'S A MIRAGE THERE. STRAIGHT THERE ON THE HORIZON. SEE ALL THAT SHIMMERING? LOOKS JUST LIKE A BIG POOL OF WATER. AH, BUT I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE YOU IT'S NOT. ALL IT IS, IS THE BLUE SKY REFLECTING IN THAT HEAT HAZE. AND THIS IS A CLASSIC MIRAGE PLACE -- YOU KNOW, HUGE, FLAT, EMPTY, AND BOILING-HOT SALT PANS. GET TEMPTED OFF COURSE BY A MIRAGE, AND YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE. THIS PLACE IS A BATTLEGROUND. TO SURVIVE IT, YOUR ONLY WEAPON IS SHEER WILLPOWER. UH, LET'S HANG ON, GUYS. HANG ON. I NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS GLARE. WE'RE GONNA BE SUN-BLIND IF WE DON'T STOP. PULL YOUR T-SHIRT DOWN OVER YOUR EYES, CUTTING SOME HOLES TO SEE THROUGH. YOU KNOW, AT ONCE, THAT TAKES THE GLARE OFF IT BECAUSE I'VE GOT DARK ABOVE AND BELOW AND JUST LITTLE SLITS TO LOOK THROUGH. IT'S AN OLD ARMY TRICK. THE SUN COOKS YOUR CORNEA, AND WITHIN HOURS, YOU CAN GO BLIND. IT'S LIKE HAVING GLASS POKED IN YOUR EYES. DON'T RISK IT. THE OTHER PROBLEM IS DEHYDRATION, A KILLER THAT CAN STRIKE IN HOURS. IT'S SO UNBEARABLY HOT HERE THAT YOUR SWEAT EVAPORATES SO FAST THAT YOU DON'T KNOW YOU'RE LOSING VITAL FLUIDS. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, YOU'RE DIZZY, NAUSEOUS, AND YOUR BODY STARTS TO FALL APART. THAT'S THE LAST OF THE WATER FROM THIS GOURD. SO, IN THIS HEAT, YOU NEED TO FIND MORE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WELL, THE MORE YOU DEHYDRATE OUT HERE, THE MORE SALTS AND MINERALS YOU LOSE. AND ONE THING YOU CAN DO IN THE SALT PAN IS JUST USE SOME OF THE SALTS ENCRUSTED IN THE GROUND. MAYBE EVEN TUCK IT UNDER YOUR TONGUE, DROP IT IN A WATER BOTTLE, AND THAT'S GONNA HELP REPLACE SOME OF THOSE LOST SALTS. [ INHALES DEEPLY ] OKAY. IT'LL BUY YOU TIME, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE ALIVE. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL, AS SOME SALT PANS AREN'T JUST NORMAL SALT LIKE YOU GET AT HOME. SOME CAN BE MADE OF CAUSTIC SODA, WHICH YOU MUST NOT TOUCH, AS IT CAN BURN YOUR SKIN AND BLIND YOU. YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE, AS CAUSTIC SODA FEELS SOAPY TO THE TOUCH WHEN IT'S WET. THAT'S THE END OF THE SALT PAN AHEAD. I SEE THE FOOTHILLS, AS WELL. AND REALLY, IF YOU WERE STUCK OUT HERE, THAT'S WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO HEAD. YOU'VE JUST GOT TO GET OFF THIS SALT PAN 'CAUSE, REALLY, THIS PLACE IS HELL. BUT EVEN IF YOU REACH THE FOOTHILLS OF THE ATLAS MOUNTAINS, IT'S FAR FROM OVER. THE NEXT CHALLENGE IS TO FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH THEM. THIS IS DEFINITELY LOOKING LIKE A BREAK RUNNING THROUGH THIS ESCARPMENT. SO, I'M JUST GONNA FOLLOW THIS AND SEE WHERE IT LEADS. THESE FALLEN BOULDERS HAVE BEEN WEATHERED OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS. THE LOOSE ROCKS ARE TRICKY TO NEGOTIATE, AND IT'S ALL TOO EASY TO TWIST YOUR ANKLE...OR WORSE. HARD PLACE TO STAY ALIVE. I REALLY THOUGHT THIS GULLY WOULD JUST LEAD TO WATER, BUT IT'S JUST LEAD TO THIS. IT'S TRICKY, AND THE SENSIBLE THING WOULD BE TO GO BACK DOWN THE GULLY. BUT I'M GONNA GIVE IT A GO JUST 'CAUSE I CAN. [ GROANS ] KEEP TO THE LEDGES AND SHELVES. TAKE IT STEADY BEFORE A QUICK SCRAMBLE UP TO THIS -- A DRIED RIVERBED. WHAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE OUT HERE IS THAT YOU'RE JUST AS LIKELY TO BE KILLED IN THE DESERT BY FLASH FLOODS AS YOU ARE BY DEHYDRATION. AND THIS IS CLASSIC FLASH-FLOOD TERRAIN, WHERE YOU GET THESE DRY RIVERBEDS. AND IT CAN RAIN UP TO 100 MILES AWAY, EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEAUTIFUL WEATHER HERE, AND WATER WILL RACE DOWN WITH, LIKE, THE ROAR OF A JET ENGINE AND JUST WIPE OUT ANYTHING IN ITS PATH. YOU'RE AT YOUR MOST VULNERABLE IN THE SUMMER, WHEN ANY DOWNPOUR CAN BE VICIOUS. JUST LAST YEAR, THE DESERT VILLAGE OF MERZOUGA WAS DESTROYED BY FLASH FLOODS. 6 PEOPLE DIED, AND 1,200 WERE LEFT HOMELESS. THERE'S NOT A DROP OF WATER FOR ME. I'M MORE LIKELY TO FIND SOME ON THE VALLEY FLOOR, BUT IT'S GETTING DOWN THERE THAT'S THE PROBLEM. [ SIGHS ] THAT IS JUST HUGE. MY CHALLENGE IS TO SOMEHOW FIND A WAY DOWN THIS MONSTER AND FIND WATER. THIS MUST BE 500 FOOT, FROM THE TOP ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM. BUT WHAT I CAN SEE OUT THERE LOOKS LIKE WADIS. AND WADIS MEAN WATER. THERE'S SO LITTLE IN THIS EXTREME ENVIRONMENT, YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED TO DO ANYTHING TO GET TO IT. I'VE JUST GOT TO FIND A WAY TO GET DOWN. I RECKON THIS IS JUST ABOUT POSSIBLE. RISKY, BUT POSSIBLE. OKAY. PASS THE CAMERA. OKAY, HERE WE GO. DOWNCLIMBING IS SO OFTEN... MORE DANGEROUS AND DIFFICULT THAN CLIMBING UP, JUST BECAUSE IT'S MUCH LESS NATURAL. THIS STUFF IS ALL SO LOOSE. IT'S ALL SANDSTONE, WHICH, IN THE CLIMBER'S BOOK, IS A NIGHTMARE TO CLIMB ON. ONE SLIP ON THIS STUFF COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS INJURY AND PROBABLY DEATH, SO YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH EVERY HAND- AND FOOTHOLD. TAKE IT CAREFULLY. IF YOU GET STUCK, YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CLIMB BACK UP OR MAKE IT DOWN. IT'S WHAT WE CALL BEING RIMROCKED. AND THAT'S HAPPENED TO ME BEFORE, IN NEW ZEALAND CLIMBING. AND IT'S VERY FRIGHTENING. GOD, THIS WHOLE THING'S JUST COLLAPSING. I'VE JUST GOT THIS LAST LITTLE BIT OF A CHIMNEY CLIMB DOWN THERE. WHEN YOU'RE DOING ONE OF THESE, USE THE OPPOSING WALLS, WITH YOUR FEET ON EACH SIDE, AND JUST SLOWLY INCH YOUR WAY DOWN. [ GRUNTS ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] OKAY, I'M DOWN OFF THAT. AND IT'S LOOKING MUCH BETTER FROM HERE. MORE OF LIKE A SCREE CLIMB DOWN TOWARDS THE WADIS. AND I REMEMBER, AS A KID, MY LATE DAD ALWAYS USED TO TAKE ME CLIMBING. AND I THINK, IF I'M HONEST, AT THAT AGE, IT WAS AS MUCH ABOUT JUST WANTING TO BE CLOSE TO HIM AS IT WAS ABOUT THE ACTUAL CLIMBING. I DIDN'T NECESSARILY ENJOY BEING COLD AND WET UP A MOUNTAIN, BUT I DID LOVE HANGING OUT WITH HIM. AND IT'S FUNNY HOW THE WILDS CAN SO OFTEN CREATE SUCH STRONG BONDS BETWEEN PEOPLE. IT CAN ALSO BRING OUT THE BEST IN YOU, AS SO OFTEN, YOU'LL FIND HIDDEN STRENGTHS YOU NEVER KNEW EXISTED. BUT FOR NOW, I NEED WATER. THERE'S GOT TO BE A WADI SOMEWHERE NEARBY. THE HEAT IS BLISTERING. I MUST PROTECT MY HEAD. OTHERWISE, I'M GONNA COOK. BUT WHERE I'M HEADING IS THERE, TO THAT GORGE. AND WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO FIND THE SOURCE OF THIS WATER AND ALSO SOME GOOD SHADE. THESE OLEANDER BUSHES GROW NEAR WATER. BUT STAY WELL CLEAR. THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL BUT DEADLY. WHAT MAKES THEM OLEANDER IS THE VERY DISTINCTIVE FIVE PETALS THAT THEY HAVE. BUT ALL OF THIS BUSH IS POISONOUS -- THE FLOWERS, THE LEAVES, EVEN THE SAP. LOOK, IF YOU LOOK DOWN HERE, ALL OF THIS WHITE STUFF, THIS IS ACTUALLY THE DRIED-OUT SAP FROM THE OLEANDER. SO IF THERE'S ANY WATER AROUND HERE, IT WOULD BE UNDRINKABLE. SO I NEED TO FIND A DIFFERENT WATER SOURCE. THEY'RE NASTY, THOSE PLANTS. VOMITING, BLOODY DIARRHEA, AND TREMORS ARE THE LEAST THEY CAN DO. PUTTING YOU INTO A COMA IS THE WORST. AND OUT HERE ALONE, THAT MEANS DEATH. GET HIGHER TO SEARCH FOR FRESHWATER. USE THE WILDLIFE TO FIND A SAFE SOURCE. UP THERE, LOOK. BIRDS. SEE? JUST AT THE HEAD OF THE GULLY THERE. SEE THEM? AND THAT IS A REALLY GOOD INDICATOR THERE MUST BE WATER SOMEWHERE NEARBY. THEY LIKE TO DRINK IN THE EARLY MORNING AND IN THE EARLY EVENING. [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] AND ACTUALLY, YOU CAN ALSO HEAR THEM. LISTEN TO THAT. YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY WHERE I'M HEADED. WAH! LOOK AT THIS! AHH. FRESH, COLD, CLEAN WATER RUNNING STRAIGHT DOWN HERE. I'LL FILL UP THIS AND MY WATER BOTTLE. HEY, LOOK. LOOK DOWN THERE. LOOK. SEE THAT? THAT FROG. WHERE IS HE? GOD, THEY'RE FAST LITTLE THINGS, THESE. THERE HE IS! [ GRUNTS ] THERE HE IS. SEE THAT? SO, I'VE GOT WATER, AND I'VE GOT FOOD. AND THIS IS A LITTLE SAHARAN FROG, AND I KNOW HE'S GOOD TO EAT. AND I CAN TELL HE'S SAHARAN. HE'S GREEN. HE'S GOT THESE LITTLE, WHITE SPOTS ON THE BACK OF HIS LEGS. IF THIS WAS BRIGHTLY COLORED OR HAD A BIG "X" ON ITS BACK, I WOULDN'T WANT TO EAT THIS. BUT THIS IS EDIBLE. [ CRUNCHING ] [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] AND I'LL SQUEEZE WHAT REMAINS OF THE GUTS OUT OF HIM. AND THEN ALL OF THAT IS GOOD TO EAT AS WELL. REFUELED NOW FOR WHAT'S AHEAD, AND I'M GONNA NEED IT. I'VE JUST REACHED A DEAD END HERE. LOOK, IT'S JUST SHEER WALLS ALL THE WAY AROUND. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA GET OUT OF THIS. WELL, MY BEST CHANCE IS GONNA BE THESE SERIES OF BUTTRESSES ALONG THERE, MAYBE THAT END ONE. SEE IF I CAN GET UP THERE AND FOLLOW THAT SKYLINE ALL THE WAY UP. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. THESE BUTTRESSES ARE OFTEN QUITE GOOD TO CLIMB, JUST BECAUSE THEY PROTRUDE, WHICH MEANS THEY GET WEATHERED. AND WHERE IT'S WEATHERED, YOU GET GOOD HANDHOLDS AND FOOTHOLDS. BUT ALL OF THIS IS LIKE A MIX OF VOLCANIC AND THEN, ALSO, SEDIMENTARY ROCK, WHICH MEANS IT'S SHARP, BUT ALSO QUITE LOOSE. BUT I RECKON THIS IS DOABLE. IT'S PRETTY EXTREME, BUT IF YOU CAN, GET UP AND OUT FAST. A DETOUR AROUND THE GORGE WOULD TAKE HOURS YOU CAN'T SPARE IN THE BATTLE FOR SURVIVAL. OKAY, LET'S BRING YOU UP THE EDGE HERE. [ EXHALING SHARPLY ] GOD, THIS STUFF'S ALL SO LOOSE. OKAY, TAKE YOUR TIME, BEAR, TAKE YOUR TIME. GOD, THIS STUFF'S HORRIBLE. AND LOOK, I'VE GOT NICE GRIPS NOW. STRAIGHT UP -- THIS RED. [ GRUNTS ] THE SAFEST TECHNIQUE IS TO MAINTAIN THREE POINTS OF CONTACT ON THE ROCK FACE AT ALL TIMES. THIS IS QUITE HIGH NOW. LET'S CLEAR THIS BIT OFF HERE. OKAY, TRY AND PASS THIS, GET YOU OVER THE LIP. COME ON. ANOTHER FOOT. ANOTHER FOOT. ANOTHER FOOT. OKAY, I'VE GOT IT. I'VE GOT IT. OKAY. LET'S GET YOU OVER THIS BIT. GO FOR IT. COMMIT TO IT. NICE. OKAY. GOT IT. HAVE A LOOK OVER HERE. SEE WHERE WE'VE COME. STRAIGHT UP THERE. WHEW! CERTAINLY MY HEART'S REALLY RACING. THERE'S AN OVERHANG ABOVE, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP MOVING. THERE'S NO GOING BACK NOW. LOOKS LIKE A LAST LITTLE BIT. IF I CAN JUST GET OVER THAT LIP, I THINK THAT'S GONNA BE THE TOP. IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A NICE HANDHOLD, JUST... JUST THERE. OVERHANG CLIMBS ARE PUNISHING. YOU RELY ENTIRELY ON YOUR UPPER BODY TO PULL YOU UP. AND IN THIS SEARING HEAT OF 130 DEGREES, YOU CAN EASILY GET CRIPPLING CRAMPS IN YOUR ARMS, WAVE AFTER WAVE OF THEM. BUT HANG ON IN THERE. QUITE A FEELING. BUT I'M UP, OUT OF THIS CANYON. AND LOOK, YOU CAN JUST SEE, IT'S PRETTY FORMIDABLE HERE. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] OKAY, ON MY WAY. WHOO! YOU SHOULD SOON PICK UP DUSTY TRACKS WHICH WILL LEAD YOU OUT OF HERE. THIS MIGHT WELL BE AN OLD CARAVAN ROUTE, THE SORT OF THING THAT NOMADS WOULD HAVE USED FOR CENTURIES WITH THEIR CAMELS. AH, BUT IF I FOLLOW THIS, IT MIGHT WELL LEAD ME TO A SETTLEMENT. THESE PATHS WERE ONCE USED TO CARRY GOLD, SALT, AND SLAVES FROM THE SOUTH SAHARA. AND THE BERBER STILL USE THEM TODAY AS TRADING ROUTES AND FOR SHELTER. YOU CAN SEE SOMEBODY'S DEFINITELY BEEN HERE. LOOK, THEY'VE MADE A LITTLE WALL TO ACT AS A WINDBREAK. AND THERE'S EVEN, LIKE, GOAT DROPPINGS AND STUFF HERE. SO SOMEBODY HAS DEFINITELY USED THIS, WHICH MEANS I'M PROBABLY ON THE RIGHT TRAIL. AND IT SHOULDN'T BE LONG BEFORE THERE'S THE BEST SIGHT IN THE WORLD. OH, BUILDINGS, PALM TREES, AND PEOPLE. AND THAT WOULD MEAN ONE THING -- YOU'RE SAFE. BUT REALLY, TO BE STRANDED OUT HERE ON YOUR OWN IN THE SAHARA DESERT WOULD BE A HELLISH PLACE TO SURVIVE. THE CHALLENGES OF THE SAHARA ARE EXTREME, BUT IT'S THE KNOWLEDGE AND SURVIVAL SKILLS OF THE BERBER PEOPLE THAT CAN HELP YOU GET OUT ALIVE. THEIR KNOWLEDGE IS LEGENDARY, AS IS THEIR HOSPITALITY. BONJOUR.
