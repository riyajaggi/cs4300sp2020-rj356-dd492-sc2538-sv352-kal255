 >> MY NAME IS BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES, I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M GONNA SHOW HOW TO SURVIVE ONE OF THE MOST TREACHEROUS LANDSCAPES ON EARTH -- ALASKA. OVER A MILLION TOURISTS COME

 HERE EVERY YEAR, AND OVER 500 GO MISSING. I'M GONNA SHOW THE SKILLS NEEDED TO STAY ALIVE. WHOA! THIS IS THE COAST OF ALASKA, JUST BELOW THE ARCTIC CIRCLE. ITS EXTRAORDINARY LANDSCAPE IS MADE UP OF ENDLESS COASTLINE, DEEP FORESTS, AND HUGE GLACIERS. I'M GOING TO MOUNT CHUGACH IN ALASKA. IT'S WHERE MOUNTAINEERS, HIKERS, AND SKIERS COME TO ENJOY THE

 WILDERNESS. BUT WITH THE THRILL COMES DANGER, AND EVERY YEAR, OVER 20 PEOPLE DIE. I'M GONNA SHOW HOW TO SURVIVE IN A WILDERNESS LIKE THIS. ANY MOMENT NOW, THE PILOT IS GONNA DROP ME ONTO THE TOP OF ONE OF THESE MOUNTAINS. >> WE GOT ABOUT 400 FEET TO TOUCHDOWN. 100 FEET. 50 FEET. >> IF NEEDED, I'LL GET SOME HELP FROM LOCAL EXPERTS, AND THE CAMERA CREW WILL FOLLOW MY JOURNEY. 17 OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS IN THE U.S. ARE HERE IN ALASKA. IT'S EVERY EXTREME SKIER'S IDEA OF HEAVEN. WITH SO FEW PEOPLE AND SO MUCH SPACE, THIS IS ONE OF AMERICA'S TRUE WILDERNESSES. JUST BEAUTIFUL! BEING OUT IN THESE MOUNTAINS -- AMAZING. THE BIGGEST THREAT TO SKIERS IS AVALANCHE. THEY KILL AROUND 40 PEOPLE EVERY YEAR IN NORTH AMERICA. ONE WRONG TURN, AND THE WHOLE MOUNTAINSIDE COULD COME CRASHING DOWN ON YOU. YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW TO AVOID THEM. THE KEY WITH AVALANCHES IS TO READ THE SNOW. AND YOU CAN USE THE SKI POLE IN FRONT OF YOU JUST TO TEST IT TO SEE WHETHER IT'S COMPACTED OR WHETHER IT'S IN LAYERS. AND WHAT YOU WANT IS, WHEN YOU PUSH IT IN, IT'S NICE AND CONSISTENT. BUT IF YOU PUSH IT DOWN, AND IT, LIKE, SUDDENLY DROPS A LITTLE BIT, IT'S A SIGN IT'S IN LAYERS, AND THAT'S THE DANGEROUS STUFF. AVALANCHES ARE OFTEN TRIGGERED BY INEXPERIENCED SKIERS AND SNOWBOARDERS WHO COME TO ENJOY THE 40 FOOT OF VIRGIN SNOW WHICH CAN OFTEN FALL HERE. IN EARLY 2006, A SNOWBOARDER FROM ANCHORAGE TRIGGERED A 200-FOOT-WIDE AVALANCHE ON A SLOPE JUST LIKE THIS. HIS BODY WAS EVENTUALLY RECOVERED THREE MONTHS LATER. HE'D FALLEN 1,600 FEET. I'VE SKIED ABOUT 5,000 FEET, AND AT LAST, I'M LEAVING THE HIGH SNOW FACES BEHIND. THERE IS SO MUCH ROCK, AND IT'S BECOMING IMPOSSIBLE TO SKI ANY FURTHER. ALL THESE SKIS WOULD DO IS SLOW YOU DOWN. YOU'D BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT THEM. BELOW ME IS A GLACIER -- LITERALLY, A RIVER OF ICE, AND, LIKE A RIVER, THIS GLACIER FLOWS DOWNHILL. I'M GONNA FOLLOW THIS RIDGE. IT'S NOT EASY, AND THE TEMPERATURE IS DROPPING FAST. TEMPERATURES HERE IN ALASKA CAN REACH AS LOW AS MINUS-60 DEGREES, AND FROSTBITE IS ALWAYS A DANGER IN THE MOUNTAINS. AND THE BITS TO WATCH OUT FOR ARE YOUR EXTREMITIES -- YOUR HANDS, YOUR FEET, YOUR FACE. AND THE SIGNS THAT YOU ARE GETTING IT IS THAT YOUR SKIN GOES THIS WAXY-RED COLOR AND EVENTUALLY BLACK. AND I'VE SEEN VERY SEVERE FROSTBITE ON CLIMBERS ON EVEREST, AND IT'S A REALLY HORRIBLE, PAINFUL THING. THIS RIDGE HAS LED TO A NORTH-FACING SLOPE. THIS GETS LESS SUNLIGHT, SO IT'S STILL COVERED IN SNOW. [ SIGHS ] THIS WEATHER IS NOT LOOKING SO GOOD. GETTING CAUGHT OUT IN BAD WEATHER CAN BE FATAL, SO YOU NEED TO GET DOWN FAST. BUT THIS SLOPE IS OVER 300 FOOT. I COULD DOWN-CLIMB, BUT IT WOULD TAKE HOURS. INSTEAD, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU A TECHNIQUE THAT MOUNTAINEERS CALL A GLISSADE. AS YOU SLIDE DOWN, YOU SLOW YOURSELF BY DIGGING IN YOUR ICE AX. I DON'T HAVE AN ICE AX, SO I'M BREAKING A SKI STICK IN HALF INSTEAD. YOU REALLY SEE THIS CLOUD NOW MOVING IN. I CAN HARDLY EVEN SEE THE BOTTOM OF THIS GLISSADE, AND I'M PRETTY NERVOUS ABOUT DOING THIS. THIS TECHNIQUE IS RISKY, BUT, IN AN EMERGENCY, IT CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE. IF YOU DON'T APPLY ENOUGH PRESSURE, YOU'LL FALL TOO FAST. BUT PUSH IN TOO HARD, AND THE STICK CAN GET RIPPED RIGHT OUT OF YOUR HAND. AAH! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] THAT WAS FAST. I'VE DONE A FEW GLISSADES BEFORE, BUT NEVER ANYTHING THAT STEEP AND THAT LONG. AND I RECKON I HIT 50 MILES AN HOUR ON THAT, AND THAT'S LIKE SPEEDING. WHEW! WHEW. I'VE REACHED THE GLACIER, AND THERE ARE OVER 100,000 OF THESE IN ALASKA. THEY FORM THE LARGEST RESERVOIR OF FRESHWATER ON EARTH. BUT THE BAD NEWS IS THEY'RE FULL OF CREVASSES -- DEEP VALLEYS OF ICE OFTEN COVERED BY LAYERS OF SNOW. AND THE ONLY SAFE WAY TO TRAVEL IS TO BE ROPED AND IN PAIRS. UGH. THERE'S SOLID GROUND RUNNING ALONGSIDE THE GLACIER, BUT KEEPING MY FOOTING IN THESE SKI BOOTS IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. [ WATER RUSHING ] OH, LOOK. I SEE THE END OF THE GLACIER. AND, YEAH, THAT'S DEFINITELY WHERE IT COMES OUT, AND THAT'S JUST SUCH A RELIEF. I'M NEARLY OFF THE SNOW AND ICE, BUT THE GLACIER STILL HAS ONE FINAL STING IN ITS TAIL -- A SHEER CLIFF. THIS IS LITERALLY NOW THE BOTTOM OF THE GLACIER, AND THIS MORAINE IS JUST DROPPING OFF IN THIS LIKE 40-FOOT WATERFALL. AND THERE'S NO WAY, IN THESE BOOTS AND WITHOUT ROPES, I'M GONNA MAKE IT DOWN THIS, AND I NEED ANOTHER PLAN. >> I'VE BEEN DROPPED INTO THE REMOTE, ICY MOUNTAINS OF ALASKA, AND NOW I HAVE TO GET OFF THIS GLACIER. BUT MY WAY DOWN IS BLOCKED BY A 40-FOOT WATERFALL, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER WAY. THERE'S AN ICE TUNNEL INTO THE GLACIER. THIS IS FORMED BY MELTWATER STREAMS WHICH RUN UNDER THE ICE. BUT THIS ONE COULD LEAD ME OUT. ICE TUNNELS ARE EXTREMELY UNSTABLE PLACES, AND GLACIERS CAN MOVE UP TO 60 FEET A DAY. BEFORE YOU GO IN, CHECK THE ICE IS SOLID. THERE COULD BE OVER 200 FEET OF ICE ABOVE ME, AND AT ANY MOMENT, IT COULD COME CRASHING DOWN. ONLY DO THIS AS A LAST RESORT. [ WATER RUNNING ] I'M FINDING IT QUITE CLAUSTROPHOBIC IN THIS PLACE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN COME, JUST SEE AROUND, BUT THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE. AND I WAS ALMOST KILLED ON A GLACIER LIKE THIS ON EVEREST, WHERE I HAD A CREVASSE GIVE WAY UNDER MY FEET. AND [SIGHS] IT'S NOT BRINGING BACK GREAT MEMORIES, BEING IN HERE. I JUST WANT TO GET OUT NOW. AND THE FURTHER YOU GO IN, THE HARDER IT IS TO GO BACK. THEN, I SEE DAYLIGHT AHEAD. IT'S MY WAY OUT. I'VE NEVER BEEN SO RELIEVED. AND, FINALLY, I'M OFF THE GLACIER. IT'S JUST SO GOOD TO BE OUT OF THAT GLACIER AND JUST HAVE SOME OPEN SPACE. BUT THE BEST NEWS OF ALL IS THAT I'M GONNA GET THESE RUDDY BOOTS OFF. AND... AH. THAT IS SO NICE. AND I'M GOING TO KEEP THESE INNERS. THEY'RE NOT IDEAL TO WALK IN, BUT I'M GOING TO NEED SOMETHING TO PROTECT MY FEET IN THE TOUGHER TERRAIN THAT'S GONNA BE AHEAD NOW. HERE, OFF THE MOUNTAIN, THERE SHOULD BE FOOD AND SHELTER. WHOA. I WAS GETTING DIVE-BOMBED BY THESE SEA GULLS, AND THAT'S A SIGN THAT I'VE PROBABLY WALKED THROUGH AN AREA THAT THEY'RE NESTING. AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT THEIR EGGS. WHAT I'M GOING TO TRY AND DO IS SEE IF I CAN FIND ONE OF THEIR NESTS AND ACTUALLY FIND MAYBE SOME EGGS TO EAT. IT'S JUNE -- PRIME NESTING SEASON -- AND THESE NESTS COULD HAVE TWO OR THREE EGGS, EACH ONE PACKED WITH PROTEIN, VITAMINS, AND MINERALS. WHOA. I'VE SCOURED ALL OVER THESE BANKS, AND I JUST CAN'T FIND WHAT THESE GUYS ARE PROTECTING. THE LANDSCAPE IS BEGINNING TO OPEN UP, AND I CAN SEE THE TREE LINE AHEAD. BUT NOW IT'S STARTING TO RAIN. BUT AT LEAST, FINALLY, I'M ALMOST IN THE FOREST. THIS IS GOOD NEWS. I'M JUST SEEING NOW THE CLOUDS CLEARING. I CAN SEE A THICK FOREST DOWN THERE, BUT ALSO WHAT LOOKS LIKE A DEEP GORGE. AND THERE MIGHT WELL BE A RIVER AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT, AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE HEADING FOR. I CAN ONLY SEE A COUPLE OF FEET AHEAD OF ME NOW, AND IT'S STRANGELY CLAUSTROPHOBIC. I KNOW THIS IS BEAR COUNTRY. BOTH BLACK AND BROWN BEARS LIVE HERE. BROWN BEARS CAN WEIGH UP TO 1,100 POUNDS, GROW TO 9 FEET TALL, AND CAN TEAR A MAN APART. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE WHERE THE BEAR HERE HAS BEEN SCRATCHING ALONG THE TREE, AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DO. THEY'LL COME ALONG, THEY'LL SCRATCH, THEN THEY'LL RUB THEIR BACK AGAINST IT, AND YOU CAN SEE ACTUALLY WHERE THE BEAR'S FUR IS THERE. AND THIS IS ALL PART OF IT JUST MARKING ITS TERRITORY. A HIKER WAS RECENTLY KILLED HERE. WHEN RANGERS FOUND THE REMAINS OF HIS BODY, THEY DISCOVERED BEAR BLOOD AT THE SCENE AND EMPTY GUN SHELLS. YO, BEAR! THE HIKER HAD FIRED TWO SHOTS AT THE BEAR, BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO STOP THE ATTACK. BUT BIG GROUPS RARELY GET ATTACKED, FOR ONE SIMPLE REASON -- LOTS OF PEOPLE MEANS LOTS OF NOISE, AND THAT WARNS OFF THE BEAR. IT'S WHEN YOU'RE ALONE THAT YOU'RE VULNERABLE. BEARS ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS WHEN THEY'RE SURPRISED. AND, ACTUALLY, MOST ATTACKS HAPPEN ON HUNTERS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE ALWAYS SNEAKING AROUND, AND THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, WHEN YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, TO KEEP MAKING LOTS OF NOISE AND LET THESE BEARS KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE. AND IT MIGHT SOUND A BIT WEIRD, BUT I'M DOING A LOT OF WANDERING AROUND AT THE MOMENT GOING, "YO, BEAR," JUST TRYING TO KEEP THEM AWAY. YO, BEAR! YO, BEAR! YO, BEAR! HOWEVER MUCH NOISE I MAKE, I STILL FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE. THIS IS BEAR CRAP. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT YOU CAN SEE IN THIS POO LITTLE SEEDS FROM BERRIES. AND THAT MEANS THERE ARE GONNA BE BERRIES SOMEWHERE AROUND NEARBY. THE BAD NEWS IS IT MEANS THERE'S A BEAR AROUND SOMEWHERE. THIS IS ONLY ABOUT A DAY OLD. THIS UNDERGROWTH IS VICIOUS. EVERY STEP HURTS. THIS IS ALL DEVIL'S CLUB, WHICH MUST BE THE SPIKIEST, THORNIEST PLANT I'VE EVER COME ACROSS. JUST LOOK, YOU CAN SEE ALL THE SPIKES, ALL ALONG THE STEM, ALL THE WAY DOWN THE STALK. ALL THE LEAVES, AS WELL, JUST COVERED IN IT. AND WHEN THE FLOWERS COME OUT, EVEN THEY HAVE SPIKES ON IT. AND THE ROOTS. AND IT'S JUST HELL TO WALK THROUGH. BUT, FOR ALASKAN NATIVES, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST REVERED MEDICINAL PLANTS, JUST FULL OF LOADS OF GOOD THINGS, LOTS OF GINSENG. BUT, TO WALK THROUGH, IT IS NOT GOOD. IT'S CLAIMED THAT GINSENG INCREASES YOUR STRENGTH AND YOUR STAMINA. A STREAM HAS MADE A CLEARING THROUGH THE DEVIL'S CLUB. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO A RIVER AND A WAY THROUGH THE FOREST. IT MEANS I CAN MOVE FAST NOW. BUT THIS WILDERNESS IS SO UNPREDICTABLE. AFTER SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS, THERE'S A MAJOR OBSTACLE -- A HUGE WATERFALL. THERE'S A CHOICE -- GO DOWN THIS OR GO BACK INTO THE DEVIL'S CLUB -- AND NEITHER OPTION FEELS LIKE A GOOD ONE. >> I'M IN THE ALASKAN FOREST. I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING A STREAM, BUT THERE'S AN OBSTACLE -- THIS WATERFALL. IT'S OVER 200 FOOT AND, EVEN WITH A SAFETY LINE, IT'S RISKY. BUT I'M AN EXPERIENCED CLIMBER. I'M GONNA SHOW HOW TO GET DOWN IT. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, WHEN YOU START DOWN HERE, IS TO TAKE YOUR TIME. AND SO MANY ACCIDENTS HAPPEN, CLIMBING, AS THE ADRENALINE GETS GOING AND YOU RUSH IT. AND I'LL TELL YOU, YOU CAN GET IT RIGHT A THOUSAND TIMES. YOU ONLY NEED ONE MISTAKE FOR IT TO ALL GO WRONG. THESE ROCKS ARE INCREDIBLY SLIPPERY, AND IT'S EASY TO MAKE MISTAKES. TO MAKE IT DOWN, I'LL NEED TO FOLLOW SOME BASIC CLIMBING RULES. LET YOUR LEGS TAKE THE PRESSURE. SO MANY PEOPLE TRY AND ALWAYS CLIMB WITH THEIR ARMS, AND YOUR ARMS GIVE OUT. YOUR LEGS ARE MUCH, MUCH STRONGER. AND JUST USE YOUR ARMS TO STEADY YOU AND TO BALANCE YOU. THERE'S LOADS OF LOOSE ROCKS, SO I HAVE TO TEST EVERY HANDHOLD. THE FORCE OF THE WATER NOW, ABOUT HALFWAY DOWN, IS MAKING IT MUCH HARDER. IT'S LIKE TRYING TO DOWN-CLIMB WHILST GIVING SOMEONE A PIGGYBACK. OKAY. THE FINAL BIT IS ALMOST VERTICAL. THIS FREEZING GLACIER WATER IS A TORRENT, AND IT'S PUSHING ME DOWN HARD, AND THE COLD IS MAKING IT MUCH WORSE. [ GASPS ] [ SIGHS ] [ GRUNTING ] THIS WATER IS JUST SO COLD, AND MY HANDS WERE GETTING SO NUMB UP THERE, I COULD HARDLY HOLD ON. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, LOOKING BACK UP THERE, THAT IS MUCH STEEPER THAN I EVER THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE WHEN I STARTED DOWN IT. WHEW. IT'S LIGHT NEARLY 24 HOURS A DAY HERE IN THE SUMMER, AND IT'S EASY TO LOSE TRACK OF TIME. BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE A REST WHEN YOU NEED TO. WITH SOAKING-WET CLOTHES, YOU'LL NEED A FIRE TO DRY THEM OUT. AND IN A SURVIVAL SITUATION, THERE'S NOTHING BETTER FOR MORALE THAN A FIRE. THERE ARE NEARLY 6 MILLION ACRES OF FOREST IN ALASKA, AND MUCH OF IT IS COVERED IN SPRUCE AND ALDER, BOTH OF WHICH ARE GREAT FOR BUILDING SHELTERS. TO BUILD A SHELTER, I'M GONNA NEED LIKE 10 OR SO OF THESE ALDER SAPLINGS. AND THE BEST WAY OF CUTTING THESE IS TO BEND IT OVER UNTIL YOU SEE THE STRESS OUT OF IT. AND THEN, WHEN THOSE FIBERS ARE UNDER STRESS, YOU CAN JUST SHEAR IT WITH A KNIFE, AND IT WILL CUT THROUGH. THAT'S FINE. YOU CAN RECOGNIZE AN ALDER BY THE LEAVES. THEY'RE SERRATED, AND THEY GROW ALTERNATELY UP THE STEM. AND I'M USING THIS SPRUCE FOR THE ROOF. I'M MAKING WHAT'S CALLED A HALF-DOME SHELTER. IT'S SIMPLE AND IT'S FAST. TO WATERPROOF IT, YOU START AT THE BOTTOM, THEN MOVE UP, PUTTING ONE LAYER ON TOP OF THE ONE BELOW. AND THEN I NEED FIRE. I ALWAYS CARRY A FLINT TO LIGHT A FIRE. NORMALLY, THIS WILLOW DOWN MAKES EXCELLENT KINDLING. BUT IT'S DAMP, SO LIGHTING THIS FIRE IS GOING TO BE A STRUGGLE. AH. AND THAT'S USED UP HALF OF IT -- THE FIRST FAILED ATTEMPT. BLACK BEARS KILL FEWER PEOPLE THAN GRIZZLIES, BUT, IN 90% OF THEIR ATTACKS, THEY LITERALLY STALK HUMANS AS PREY. MANY LOCALS CARRY A GUN. PEOPLE OFTEN THINK THAT GRIZZLY BEARS ARE THE REALLY DANGEROUS ONES, BUT, IN THIS PART OF ALASKA, THE MOST DANGEROUS BEARS ARE ACTUALLY THE BLACK BEARS. AND IF ONE APPROACHES YOU, DEPENDING ON WHICH IT IS, YOU NEED TO REACT DIFFERENTLY. IF IT'S A BROWN BEAR, THE CHANCES ARE IT'S A TERRITORIAL ISSUE, AND THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS JUST BE SUBMISSIVE AND BACK OFF. IF IT'S A BLACK BEAR, THE CHANCES ARE IT'S AFTER YOU. AND IN THAT CASE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE NO CHOICE APART FROM TO FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE. YOUR BODY HAS AN INTERNAL CLOCK WHICH MAKES YOU SLEEP WHEN ITS DARK AND WAKE WHEN IT'S LIGHT. SO, IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, WHERE IT'S ONLY DARK FOR FOUR HOURS, A FULL NIGHT'S SLEEP IS ALWAYS GONNA BE HARD. >> IT'S NOW 5:00 A.M., AND IT'S ALREADY LIGHT. I'M AWAKE AND A LITTLE CRANKY. IT'S STILL RAINING. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] AND I'M GETTING A BIT CHEESED OFF. BUT I THINK THAT'S ALL RIGHT WHEN YOU'VE BEEN WET ALL NIGHT. I THINK YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE A BIT CHEESED OFF. I'M GOING TO CARRY ON, FOLLOWING THE SAME STREAM THAT I FOLLOWED YESTERDAY. I'VE SEEN A RIVER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE VALLEY, AND THAT'S WHERE I NEED TO GET TO. BUT FOLLOWING THE RIVER IS NOT EASY. LOTS OF SMALLER STREAMS FLOW INTO IT, SO I'M CONSTANTLY FORCED TO CROSS THEM. AW, I'M SO COLD. [ CHUCKLES ] FAST. FAST-FLOWING, THIS. AND THESE GLACIAL RIVERS ARE DECEPTIVELY FAST AND COLD. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO STAY FACING UPSTREAM SO YOU CAN FIGHT AGAINST THE FLOW. AFTER SEVERAL MILES, THE RIVER WIDENS. THE COAST SHOULD BE NEAR. AH. AT LAST, THE SEA. I'VE COME OUT INTO ONE OF THE MANY SMALL INLETS THAT DOT THE ALASKAN COASTLINE. YOUR BEST CHANCE OF BEING PICKED UP WILL BE TO BE SPOTTED BY ONE OF THE MANY SMALL FISHING BOATS THAT FISH THIS AREA. HEY, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK. IT'S A DEAD SALMON. AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE OVER THERE. THIS IS GREAT NEWS. IT MEANS THE SALMON ARE USING THIS TO RUN UPSTREAM. AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DO. THEY'LL RETURN FROM OFTEN LIKE UP TO 200 MILES OUT TO SEA. THEY'LL FIND THE EXACT SAME RIVER THAT THEY WERE BORN, EVEN THE SAME TRIBUTARY, RETURN TO IT, LAY THEIR EGGS, AND THEN THEY'LL DIE. THE RIVER IS PACKED WITH KING AND PINK SALMON. I HAVEN'T GOT A FISHING LINE WITH ME, SO I NEED TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OF CATCHING ONE. I'M MAKING A SPEAR OUT OF WOOD. HERE'S A TREE WHERE THE BRANCHES FORK OUT IN A "V," ABOUT 4 FOOT ALONG THE MAIN STEM. THE FIRST STEP IS TO CLEAR ALL THE OTHER SHOOTS AND THEN BREAK OFF THE TWO BRANCHES AND CUT THEM INTO SHARP POINTS. THESE WILL PUNCTURE THE TOUGH SKIN OF THE FISH AND KEEP IT PINNED DOWN WHILE I GRAB IT WITH MY HANDS. THERE MUST BE A THOUSAND SALMON IN THIS POOL DOWN HERE, BUT IT'S TOO DEEP FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO SPEAR ONE. BUT I RECKON, IF I CAN SPOOK THEM AND DRIVE THEM UP INTO SHALLOWS, THEN I'LL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE. MY TACTIC IS WORKING. THE FISH ARE GOING JUST WHERE I NEED THEM. I CAN SEE JUST LOADS AND LOADS OF THEM THERE, AND THEY'RE IN ABOUT 6 INCHES OF WATER. AND THE KEY IS JUST FOR ME TO APPROACH FROM DOWNSTREAM VERY STEADILY. ONE OF THE SALMON'S MAIN PREDATORS ARE EAGLES, WHICH SWOOP IN FROM ABOVE, SO THE FISH ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO SHADOWS. IF THEY SEE MINE, THEY'LL BE OFF. I'M WAITING FOR THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY. AS I STAND MOTIONLESS, THE FISH START TO COME CLOSER. BUT THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO BE JUST OUT OF MY REACH. AND THEY SAY, THE KEY FOR FISHING IS PATIENCE. I'M PROBABLY THE LEAST PATIENT PERSON YOU'LL EVER MEET. NOW I'M GONNA TAKE A MORE AGGRESSIVE APPROACH. THROWING THE SPEAR AROUND GETS ME NOWHERE, AND MY IMPATIENCE FINALLY GETS THE BETTER OF ME. WHOA! [ SCOFFS ] I HAD IT. IT WAS LIKE -- THAT WAS SO CLOSE. I GIVE UP. BUT ONE OF THE CREW HAS MORE LUCK. YOU CAN EAT THESE THINGS STRAIGHT OUT OF THE RIVER LIKE THAT. [ CHUCKLES ] MMM. THAT IS, LIKE, THE FRESHEST ALASKAN SALMON YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE. I'VE ALWAYS LIKED SUSHI, AND IN THE LOCAL EYAK COMMUNITIES, THE ANNUAL FISH RUNS WERE THE PRIMARY FOOD SOURCE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. FISH ARE PACKED FULL OF PROTEIN. AND THE SCALES ARE SMALL ON A SALMON, SO YOU CAN EAT THE SKIN, AS WELL, AS IT CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF FAT -- JUST WHAT MY BODY NEEDS TO KEEP MOVING. I'M GONNA TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THIS FEAST. I MIGHT BE OUT OF THE FOREST, BUT I KNOW THAT I'M STILL SURROUNDED BY BEARS. THEY COME DOWN HERE TO FISH. HEY, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK. THIS IS WHY YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO CAREFUL AROUND HERE. LOOK, YOU CAN SEE WHERE A BEAR HAS OBVIOUSLY COME DOWN AND PLONKED HIS FAT BACKSIDE DOWN HERE AND STARTED TO FEAST ON THIS SALMON. BUT, AMAZING, YOU ACTUALLY SEE -- LOOK -- THE IMPRINT OF WHERE HE'S BEEN. AND, ACTUALLY, YOU CAN SEE THE BIT THAT IT'S EATEN IS ALL THE BELLY FAT AND THE EGGS AND THE GUTS. THAT'S THE MOST FAT- AND PROTEIN-RICH. AND THEN IT JUST LEAVES THE REST OF IT. BUT THIS IS WHY YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO CAREFUL OUT HERE. IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF BERRIES AND PLANTS YOU CAN EAT WITH YOUR FISH. THIS IS ESKIMO POTATO -- THIS PLANT HERE. IF I PULL THIS UP... AND GET TO THE ROOT OF IT, THIS IS ALL EDIBLE. AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, IT'S ALL A BIT STRINGY. AND THE BEST WAY, REALLY, IS TO, YOU KNOW, ROAST THIS ON A FIRE, BUT YOU CAN EAT THIS RAW. IT'S A BIT MUDDY, BUT A REALLY, REALLY GOOD FOOD SOURCE, AND MANY PEOPLE SAY IT'S THE MOST VALUABLE FOOD SOURCE IN ALL OF ALASKA. THESE ROOTS ARE FULL OF STARCH AND CARBOHYDRATE. IT'S HARDLY A GOURMET DINNER, BUT IT'LL KEEP ME GOING A LITTLE LONGER. IT'S BEEN A TOUGH DAY. CAVES ARE READY-MADE SHELTERS BUT ARE OFTEN ALREADY OCCUPIED BY WILDLIFE, INCLUDING BEARS. THIS ONE IS SO SHALLOW THAT I KNOW IT'S SAFE AND IT'S A PERFECT PLACE TO STOP. THE HIGH WALLS MEAN THAT NOTHING CAN SNEAK UP ON ME FROM BEHIND. [ SIGHS ] BUT ALASKA STILL HAS SO MUCH TO THROW AT ME. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] WHOA. [ GASPING ] UGH. >> NOW I'M ON THE COAST HERE IN ALASKA, THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OF FOOD, ESPECIALLY ON THE BEACH AT LOW TIDE. THIS ROCK HERE IS JUST COVERED IN THESE MUSSELS, AND IT'S A GREAT SOURCE OF FOOD. I'M GOING TO GET A LOAD OF THIS AND THEN COOK IT UP LATER. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW, PART OF THE STAPLE DIET OF A LOT OF LOCAL ALASKAN TRIBES. SHELLFISH SHOULD ALWAYS BE COOKED PROPERLY FIRST, SO I NEED FIRE. OLD-MAN'S-BEARD GROWS ON THE BRANCHES OF TREES, AND IT BURNS EASILY, BUT I NEED TO FIND WOOD, AS WELL. YEAH, THIS IS SORT OF DEAD WOOD THAT I WANT. WOOD THAT'S DEAD ON THE GROUND IS OFTEN COVERED IN MOSS AND IS REALLY DAMP, BUT THIS IS GREAT BECAUSE IT'S OFF THE GROUND AND IT'S DRY. AND IT SHOULD CRACK. AND A GOOD WAY OF TELLING IF WOOD IS GOOD FOR BURNING IS IF YOU HEAR THAT CRACK. SORT OF SOUNDS LIKE THE CRACKLE WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY BURNING ON A FIRE, AND THAT'S A GOOD SIGN IT'S GOOD WOOD FOR BURNING. WITH NO PAN TO COOK THEM IN, I'VE SURROUNDED THE MUSSELS WITH TWO LAYERS OF SEAWEED. THIS EFFECTIVELY, LIKE, STEAMS THEM. AND THIS SHOULD TAKE ABOUT 10 MINUTES TO COOK. WHEN YOU'RE COLLECTING THEM, TAP THE MUSSELS. IF THEY DON'T CLOSE, THEY'RE ALREADY DEAD, SO LEAVE THEM. BUT ONCE COOKED, THEY SHOULD BE OPEN. WOW, THOSE REALLY ARE GOOD. OH! OW. [ BLOWING SHARPLY ] DOWN HERE ON THE COAST, I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO GET YOURSELF SEEN BY ANY PASSING BOATS. I'VE GOT SUCH GOOD VISIBILITY ALL THE WAY OUT INTO SEA HERE. AND IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH, WHILE I AM HERE, GETTING A SIGNAL FIRE GOING. AND ALL I'M DOING IS BUILDING THIS BACK UP AGAIN. AND THEN I'M GOING TO PUT ON TOP OF IT A LOAD OF EVERGREEN BRANCHES, AND THESE WILL SMOKE. AND... IF ANYONE IS PASSING... THEY MIGHT WELL SEE THIS. IT'S VITAL TO CREATE WHITE SMOKE TO CONTRAST WITH THE DARK BACKGROUND OF THE TREES BEHIND ME. BUT NATURE IS CONSPIRING AGAINST ME. YOU NOTICE HERE, THE SMOKE'S NOT RISING VERY WELL INTO THE AIR. IT ACTUALLY LOOKS AS IF IT'S, LIKE, GETTING PUSHED DOWN, AND THAT'S A SIGN THAT LOW PRESSURE MIGHT WELL BE ON ITS WAY. SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEAUTIFUL BLUE SKIES AT THE MOMENT, IT MIGHT WELL BE GETTING MUCH WORSE. BETTER KEEP MOVING. BUT IT'S TOUGH GOING. THE SHORELINE CONSTANTLY SWELLS IN AND OUT OF THESE DEEP BAYS. BUT OVER ON THE BANK ARE SOME BUILDINGS. THEY LOOK LIKE A FISHING LODGE. HUH? BUT THE PATHS ARE OVERGROWN, AND THE BUILDING IS A SHAMBLES. ALASKA HAS A HISTORY OF BOOM AND BUSTS. THE COASTLINE IS LITTERED WITH DISUSED GOLD MINES, TINNING FACTORIES, AND, FROM WHAT I CAN SEE, OLD LODGES. I'M SURE, AT ONE TIME, THIS PLACE WOULD HAVE BEEN BUSTLING WITH TREKKERS, BUT TODAY IT'S DESERTED. HERE, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. THIS IS A VIEW YOU WANT TO BUILD YOUR HOUSE LOOKING AT. LOOK AT THAT. JUST BEAUTIFUL OVER THE MOUNTAINS OF THE GLACIER. AMAZING. AND A BEAUTIFUL GLACIER LIKE THIS COULD PROVIDE YOUR WAY OUT OF HERE. THESE COASTAL GLACIERS ARE NOTORIOUS TOURIST HOT SPOTS, AND THERE MIGHT WELL BE A BOAT THERE. BUT IT LOOKS MILES AWAY. THIS IS GREAT. LOOK. LITTLE BOATS ARE OFTEN USED BY THESE LODGES, AND, AS A LAST RESORT, YOU SHOULD USE ONE. I JUST NEED A PADDLE, AND THIS SPADE WILL DO THE JOB. IF YOU TAKE A BOAT FROM THE SHORELINE, YOU CAN NEVER BE ABSOLUTELY SURE IT'S WATERTIGHT. NEXT, I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR BOAT BEGINS TO TAKE ON WATER IN THIS ICY SEA. >> I'M IN A BASIC SKIFF, AND I'M SLOWLY WORKING MY WAY ALONG THE COASTLINE. ON FOOT, IT WOULD TAKE YOU DAYS TO WALK AROUND THESE ENDLESS CRAGGY INLETS. BUT BOATS CAN OFTEN BE A RISK, AND, IN A MOMENT, I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT CAN HAPPEN. THERE'S A STORY OF A FATHER AND HIS TEENAGE KIDS WHO RAN AGROUND IN A WINTER STORM. AND THEY WAITED 10 DAYS FOR RESCUE, BUT IT NEVER CAME. AND THE FATHER THEN MADE A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO LEAVE HIS TEENAGE GIRLS WHILST HIM AND HIS SON WENT OFF TO LOOK FOR HELP. AND THEY EVENTUALLY FOUND AN OLD LOG CABIN, BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNS OF LIFE. AND A STORM THEN CAME IN, AND IT WAS SIX DAYS BEFORE THE WEATHER BROKE. AND HE ASSUMED HIS DAUGHTERS WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. BUT WHEN IT DID BREAK, THEY FOUND AN OLD SKIFF, MANAGED TO REPAIR IT, AND USED THAT TO GET BACK TO HIS DAUGHTERS, WHO AMAZINGLY WERE STILL ALIVE. AND THEN, A DAY LATER, THEY WERE ALL RESCUED. I'VE ENTERED A BAY FULL OF SEA ICE, AND, AS I GO ON, THE ICE THICKENS. SOON, ICE BLOCKS ARE ALL AROUND ME. THEY MAY LOOK MAGNIFICENT, BUT THEY CAN CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO EVEN A LARGE BOAT. AND, IN 1989, THE EXXON VALDEZ, A 33,000-TON OIL TANKER, WENT AGROUND IN ALASKA WHILE TRYING TO AVOID ICEBERGS JUST LIKE THESE. JUST AMAZING, THIS PLACE. I'LL TELL YOU, OUT OF ALL THE PLACES I'VE BEEN, I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SEEN A LANDSCAPE SO EXTRAORDINARY -- JUST THOUSANDS OF THESE LITTLE ICEBERGS JUST FLOATING AROUND. AND ALL OF THESE WOULD HAVE JUST PEELED OFF THESE GLACIERS THAT ARE TUMBLING DOWN INTO THE SEA. AND SOME OF THESE BITS OF ICE, THEY CAN BE UP TO 5,000 YEARS OLD. AND IT'S JUST AN AMAZING LANDSCAPE TO BE IN. YOU CAN ONLY EVER SEE THE TIP OF AN ICEBERG, AS 90% IS SUBMERGED. AS ICE MELTS FASTER WHEN IT COMES INTO CONTACT WITH WATER, EVENTUALLY THE BERGS BECOME TOP-HEAVY AND ROLL, OFTEN VIOLENTLY. ALL THIS ICE IS BEGINNING TO CLOSE IN A BIT NOW, AND IT'S SO DISORIENTATING TRYING TO WORK OUT WHERE YOU ARE, JUST BECAUSE ALL OF THESE THINGS MOVE WITH THE CURRENT, AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE A GAP ONE MINUTE THEN SUDDENLY, LIKE, CLOSES UP IN FRONT OF YOU. IT'S JUST SO HARD TO GET THROUGH THIS STUFF. IT'S LIKE ROCK. [ SIGHS ] YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH DAMAGE THESE THINGS CAN DO. AND IF YOUR BOAT TAKES IN WATER... I NEED TO GET TO THE LAND. DO YOU SEE THAT SPIT OF LAND -- ALL THAT GRAVEL THERE? THAT'S WHERE I NEED TO GO. THE CAMERA CREW ARE IN PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. I AM NOT. MY ONLY OPTION IS TO SWIM FOR IT. THIS THING IS JUST GOING NOW. BUT, FIRST, I'VE GOT TO TAKE SOME CLOTHES OFF, OR THEY'RE GONNA REALLY WEIGH ME DOWN. ...BEFORE IT COMPLETELY GOES. DON'T SINK YET. DON'T SINK YET. IT'S JUST THAT TINY LITTLE BIT OF BUOYANCY KEEPING IT UP. THIS THING IS ON ITS LAST LEGS. JUST THAT BUOYANCY IN THE BOW. WHOA! [ GASPING ] OH, MAN. THE SHOCK OF HITTING THIS WATER MAKES ME GASP, AND THE DANGER IS SUCKING IN A BIG LUNGFUL OF AIR AND WATER, AND THAT'S HOW PEOPLE DROWN. [ GASPING ] MY HEART RATE HAS GONE THROUGH THE ROOF, AND I'M BEGINNING TO HYPERVENTILATE. IN SOME PEOPLE, THIS CAN INDUCE A HEART ATTACK. [ GASPING ] OH, MAN. [ GASPING ] I'VE GOT TO GET THIS COTTON OFF. COTTON LITERALLY SUCKS THE HEAT OUT OF YOUR BODY. IT'S A KILLER WHEN WET. IF YOU GET SOAKED IN A COTTON T-SHIRT AND PAIR OF JEANS IN CONDITIONS LIKE THIS, YOU NEED TO GET THEM OFF FAST. YOU'LL SURVIVE LONGER NAKED. AND THIS STUFF IS ALL GLACIER WATER. AND SEAWATER FREEZES AT A MUCH LOWER TEMPERATURE THAN NORMAL WATER, SO, EFFECTIVELY, THAT'S LIKE COLDER THAN ICE. MY FINGERS AND TOES ARE SO NUMB. I NEED TO GET THE BLOOD FLOWING BACK. MY JACKET HAS STAYED DRY IN THE BACKPACK, AND THIS WILL WARM ME UP. THE GLACIAL BAY OPENS UP INTO THE SEA. I CAN JUST SEE FOR MILES, ALL THE WAY UP AND DOWN THE COASTLINE HERE. AND I'M JUST GONNA TAKE STOCK AND TRY AND WARM UP A BIT ON SOME OF THESE ROCKS... AND NOT MOVE ANYWHERE UNTIL I JUST GET DRY AND PROPERLY WARM. THIS WILL BE A PERFECT SPOT TO WAIT. FISHING BOATS, AS WELL AS TOURIST BOATS, OFTEN SAIL INTO THESE INLETS, AND IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY PEOPLE COME. IT'S BEAUTIFUL. [ SEA GULLS CRYING ] I'M HEADING OFF FURTHER DOWN THE BEACH TO SEE WHAT I CAN FIND. AND A BOAT HAS BEEN SENT TO PICK ME UP. HEY, LOOK, LOOK! HEY! WHOO! AND I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO ATTRACT THEIR ATTENTION. THEY'VE SEEN ME. THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY FROM HARSH MOUNTAIN PEAKS TO THESE ICY SEAS. ALASKA IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN TRULY COME CLOSE TO NATURE, AND THAT, FOR ME, IS ITS REAL MAGIC.
