 Man vs. Wild (2006â€“2020): Season 1, Episode 12 - Mexico - full transcript 
 Three hundred miles south of the U.S. border, half a million people visit Mexico's Copper Canyon every year -- and over a hundred find themselves in need of rescue. Four times larger and a thousand feet deeper than the Grand Canyon, starvation and dehydration are big threats for anyone who gets stranded here. With only a water bottle, a flint and a knife, host Bear Grylls demonstrates how to build a simple compass and climb sheer cliffs safely. For shelter, he uses ancient caves and makes fire with a traditional "fire saw." Bear also offers important techniques for finding scorpions or grubs and fishing without a rod or line.

 I'M BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES, I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, AND CROSSED THE FROZEN WATERS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST CANYON SYSTEMS, COPPER CANYON, MEXICO. IT'S A MECCA FOR HIKERS AND CLIMBERS, BUT HUNDREDS GET LOST EVERY YEAR. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE SKILLS NEEDED TO SURVIVE HERE. I'M ENTERING MEXICO'S COPPER CANYON, 300 MILES SOUTH OF THE U.S. BORDER.

 THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DEEP, TWISTING CANYONS THAT CUT THROUGH A DESERT THE SIZE OF MASSACHUSETTS. AND IT'S FOUR TIMES LARGER AND A THOUSAND FEET DEEPER THAN THE GRAND CANYON! THIS PLACE IS WILD! THE LANDSCAPE HAS REMAINED UNTOUCHED FOR CENTURIES -- THAT'S WHY PEOPLE COME HERE. AND IT'S FAST BECOMING ONE OF MEXICO'S HIKING HOT SPOTS. LAST YEAR, HALF A MILLION PEOPLE VISITED. BUT PARTS OF THE CANYONS ARE SO REMOTE THAT THEY ARE STILL UNMAPPED. WITHOUT A GUIDE, GETTING LOST IS ALMOST GUARANTEED. I'M GONNA PUT MYSELF INTO THE POSITION OF A LOST TOURIST TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SURVIVE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

 THERE'S LITTLE SIGN OF LIFE HERE, MAKING STARVATION AND DEHYDRATION A BIG THREAT TO ANYONE STRANDED. THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO LAND IN THE VALLEYS DOWN THERE. IT'S JUST TOO STEEP. THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN DROP ME IS RIGHT ON THE TOP. WE'RE OVER 9,500 FEET UP -- ALMOST AT THE LIMIT OF WHERE THIS SINGLE-ENGINE HELICOPTER CAN HOVER SAFELY. I'M GONNA USE A TECHNIQUE I LEARNED FROM THE SPECIAL FORCES, AND IT'S CALLED "THE DUST OFF." THE PILOT COMES IN FAST AND TOUCHES DOWN JUST FOR A SECOND WHILST HOVERING AT FULL POWER. ESTAMOS A 100 PIES. AHORA ESTAMOS A 50 PIES. I'LL BE RECEIVING SOME HELP IF NEEDED FROM LOCAL EXPERTS ALONG THE WAY. AND A FILM CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. OKAY, GO! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] OH, IT JUST FEELS LIKE -- IT FEELS LIKE THE TOP OF THE WORLD. JUST BREATHTAKING. [ SNIFFLES ] BUT IT'S ALSO JUST HUGE, AND IT MAKES ME FEEL PRETTY SMALL HERE. ANYONE TRYING TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS LANDSCAPE FACES A MASSIVE CHALLENGE. I CAN SEE OVER 25 MILES, AND THERE IS NO SIGN OF HUMAN ACTIVITY. FIRST, LET ME SHOW YOU HOW TO GET YOUR BEARINGS. IF YOU LOOK OVER HERE YOU CAN SEE THE CONTRAST IN THE CANYONS. WHERE A LOT OF THESE FACES HERE HAVE A LOT MORE VEGETATION THAN DOWN HERE, WHERE IT'S A LOT DRYER -- LOOKS A LOT MORE PARCHED. AND WHAT IT MEANS, IT MEANS ALL OF THOSE FACES ARE NORTH-FACING. THEY RECEIVE LESS SUN AND THEREFORE MORE MOISTURE. SO NORTH IS THIS WAY. WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE CHIHUAHUA PACIFIC RAILWAY LINE LIES TO THE WEST OF ME, AND THIS RUNS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE COPPER CANYON FOR ABOUT 400 MILES FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH. IT'S 75 DEGREES RIGHT NOW, BUT AT 9,500 FEET, AS SOON AS THE SUN GOES DOWN, IT WILL GET DRAMATICALLY COLDER. THE ONE THING ABOUT THIS ENVIRONMENT HERE IS THAT THE DAYS ARE REALLY HOT, AND THEN I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE, AT THIS ALTITUDE, THE NIGHTS ARE GONNA GET VERY COLD. AND IT'S THAT CONTRAST THAT MAKES THIS PLACE DANGEROUS. YOU NEED TO DESCEND FAST. UP HERE, TEMPERATURES WILL PLUMMET TO 15 DEGREES. AT THE BOTTOM, THOUGH, IT WILL BE 40 DEGREES WARMER. BUT THAT'S OVER A VERTICAL MILE AWAY. EVEN IF YOU FOUND A DIRECT ROUTE DOWN, IT WILL STILL TAKE HOURS TO REACH. BUT FINDING A ROUTE DOWN JUST LOOKS IMPOSSIBLE. BEING THIS CLOSE TO THE EDGE IS THE ONLY WAY TO FIND A WAY DOWN HERE, IF THERE IS ONE. BUT IT IS DANGEROUS. I'M LOOKING FOR WHAT CLIMBERS CALL A LINE OF WEAKNESS -- WHERE THE ROCK'S BEEN ERODED. THESE OFTEN GIVE YOU A ROUTE DOWN. BUT THERE'S NO WAY DOWN HERE. THIS JAGGED LANDSCAPE IS UNFORGIVING. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE ANYTHING SURVIVING UP HERE. BUT AMAZINGLY, THERE ARE SIGNS OF LIFE. LOOK, SEE THIS ANIMAL POO? AND, LOOK, YOU SEE WHAT'S IN IT THERE. A BIT OF SEED, LOTS OF HAIR, EVEN A BIT OF BONE. AND THAT TELLS ME IT'S AN OMNIVORE. ACTUALLY THESE TAPERED ENDS ALSO SAY THIS IS MORE THAN LIKELY GONNA BE COYOTE POO. AND THE IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THESE DOGS CAN REACH UP HERE. THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO LIVE UP HERE. THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH FOOD OR WATER -- IT MEANS THEY MUST HAVE EASY ACCESS UP AND DOWN. THE PROBLEM IS IT COULD BE A LONG WAY AWAY. COYOTES HAVE A TERRITORY OF OVER 10 SQUARE MILES AND CAN RUN AT UP TO 40 MILES AN HOUR. IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO GET DOWN HERE. THERE ARE LIKE THESE SERIES OF ONE, TWO, THREE LEDGES, AND IT IS HIGH, AND THE RISK IS JUST NOT KNOWING WHAT'S, YOU KNOW, FURTHER DOWN. BUT AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT A WAY UP ALWAYS, IT'S A RISK THAT'S WORTH TAKING TO GET OFF HERE. BUT YOU NEED TO BE CAREFUL. A CLIMBER RECENTLY FELL HERE, WHILST DOWNCLIMBING A SHEER FACE JUST LIKE THIS ONE. HE DROPPED 30 FOOT ONTO JAGGED ROCKS AND WAS LEFT WITH A SERIES OF SPLINTERED VERTEBRAE. BUT HE WAS LUCKY. HE WAS RESCUED AND SURVIVED. THIS IS WHY DOWNCLIMBING'S ALWAYS MORE DANGEROUS, JUST BECAUSE TO SEE YOUR WAY, YOU HAVE TO LEAN OUT AND TRY AND FIND YOUR FOOTHOLDS... WHICH ON THIS FACE ARE PRETTY THIN. FROM ABOVE, IT'S ALSO MUCH HARDER TO PLAN YOUR ROUTE, AND IT'S EASY TO GET RIMROCKED -- WHERE YOU GET STUCK IN A POSITION WHERE YOU CAN'T GO UP OR DOWN. THE KEY IS TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT AN ESCAPE ROUTE BACK UP IF YOU CAN'T DESCEND ANY FURTHER. I'M DOWN OFF THIS FIRST LEDGE, THAT'S WHERE I'VE COME FROM, AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING. FURTHER DOWN, THE OVERHANG BECOMES MORE EXTREME. IT'S EVEN HARDER NOW TO SEE WHERE I'M GOING. AND THIS IS NEVER A NICE POSITION, AS A CLIMBER, TO FIND YOURSELF IN -- LOWERING YOURSELF ON YOUR STOMACH OFF A ROCK FACE WHEN YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S DOWN BELOW. UGH. BAD PLACE TO SIT ON A CACTUS ON THIS LEDGE. OW! NOW I'M ON THE BOTTOM LEDGE, I CAN SEE IT'S STEEP -- TOO STEEP. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT DOWN THERE. THERE'S NO WAY -- THERE'S NO WAY I'LL CLIMB...DOWN THAT ONE. THERE'S A 50-FOOT DROP IN FRONT OF ME, AND THERE'S NO WAY DOWN. I'M 9,500 FEET UP IN COPPER CANYON, MEXICO. I'M ON A LEDGE, AND THERE'S NO WAY DOWN. OKAY. [ GRUNTS ] ON MY RIGHT-HAND SIDE, THERE'S ANOTHER ROUTE DOWN. BUT TO GET TO IT, I'LL HAVE TO CROSS A DEEP GULLY. LET ME SEE IF I CAN MAKE THIS LEAP ACROSS THERE. OKAY. IT'S 8 FOOT WIDE AND I'VE GOT NO RUN-UP. HERE WE GO. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ PANTING ] OKAY. WELL, I'M OFF THE TOP OF THAT, I'M ACROSS THIS GULLY, AND, LOOK, ALL OF THIS NOW LOOKS QUITE MANAGEABLE. ON A CLIMB LIKE THAT, IT WOULD BE EASY TO RIP YOUR CLOTHES, AND THAT'D BE BAD NEWS IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, WHERE YOU NEED ALL THE PROTECTION YOU CAN FROM THE FREEZING NIGHTS. BUT THE AGAVE PLANT OFFERS A SOLUTION -- NATURE'S OWN NEEDLE AND THREAD. WHAT I NEED TO DO IS GET ONE OF THESE CENTER ONES AND TRY AND GET MY MOUTH AROUND IT WITHOUT GETTING PRICKED IN THE LEG. AND THEN YOU JUST BITE IT OFF THERE. THE SPIKE'S ATTACHED TO FIBERS THAT RUN THE LENGTH OF THE LEAF, AND THESE FORM THE THREAD. AND HERE IT COMES. ONCE IT STARTS TO GO, IT BECOMES A BIT EASIER TO PULL THE THREAD OUT. AND NOW LOOK AT THAT. AND THEN YOU'VE GOT, LIKE, A NEEDLE AND A REALLY LONG BIT OF THREAD. THERE'S ONE WAY TO TEST IT -- TO DELIBERATELY SLICE OPEN MY TOP. I HOPE IT WORKS. THERE YOU GO. WE'LL TRY AND SEW IT UP WITH THIS AND SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. THE LARGER THE LEAF, THE LONGER THE THREAD. BUT YOU'LL NEED TO THIN OUT THE SPIKE A BIT WITH YOUR KNIFE FIRST. AND JUST DO ONE FINAL STITCH THROUGH HERE, AND BACK ON ITSELF. AND THAT'S MAYBE NOT THE NEATEST JOB IN THE WORLD, BUT IT'S GONNA DO THE JOB. AND I'VE GOT A FRIEND WHO USED THIS ON HIS PAIR OF JEANS, AND IT ACTUALLY LASTED, HE SAID, FOR FOUR YEARS, BEING WASHED AND EVERYTHING. SO IT SHOWS IT DOES WORK AND IT IS TOUGH AND IT IS DURABLE. I'M NOW AT 7,000 FEET, AND FOR EVERY 1,000 FEET I DROP, THE TEMPERATURE WILL RISE 3 1/2 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE TEMPTING TO GO ON, BE CAREFUL YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF TIME. THERE'S A GOOD TIP THAT I KNOW FOR WORKING OUT JUST HOW MUCH DAYLIGHT IS LEFT. AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU MEASURE THE DISTANCE FROM THE SUN DOWN TO THE HORIZON. THE TECHNIQUE FOR DOING IT IS IF YOU PUT YOUR HAND UP, YOU PUT THE SUN JUST ABOVE YOUR FINGERS, AND THEN EACH FINGER DOWN TO THE HORIZON IS 15 MINUTES. SO A HAND -- FOUR FINGERS -- ONE HOUR THAT, DOWN, TWO HOURS. SO I'VE GOT ABOUT TWO HOURS OF DAYLIGHT LEFT, 40 MILLION YEARS AGO, MASSES OF VOLCANIC ASH AND LAVA WERE DEPOSITED HERE. THE FLOWING LAVA CUT DEEP FISSURES IN THE LAND TO FORM THE CANYONS. THE BASE OF VOLCANIC CLIFFS ARE OFTEN RIDDLED WITH CAVES, AND FINDING ONE IS YOUR BEST CHANCE OF SHELTER. BUT I NEED TO BE CAREFUL WHERE I PUT MY HANDS HERE. THERE'S FALLEN ROCKS EVERYWHERE, AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE SCORPIONS AND TARANTULAS LIVE. OH, HERE'S ONE. HERE WE GO. LOOK AT THIS. SEE THIS? TIGER SCORPION. AND THESE ARE QUITE COMMON AROUND HERE. LOOK, HE'S PRETTY CHEESED OFF. BUT HE'S A PREDATOR. HE WILL LIVE OFF OTHER BUGS AND INSECTS. AND, LOOK, AS SOON AS I PUT A STICK THERE, HE'LL STRIKE. LOOK, HE'S TRYING TO GET TO IT. BUT ACTUALLY, THESE ARE GOOD PROTEIN. YOU CAN EAT THESE. THEY'RE NOT MEANT TO TASTE VERY NICE. BUT WHAT I WANT TO DO, ACTUALLY, IS JUST CUT OFF HIS STINGER, WHICH IS THIS BIT HERE. SEE THAT BALL, LIKE A BALL OF VENOM WITH A LITTLE STINGER ON THE END OF IT. I'LL PIN HIM DOWN AND THEN JUST TAKE THAT OFF. HERE YOU GO, YOU SEE HIM THERE. AH, BUT THAT'S ALL GOOD TO EAT. [ CRUNCHES ] OHH, TASTES LIKE KIND OF CHEESE THAT'S BEEN SITTING AROUND FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS... ...BUT WORSE. FIVE SPECIES OF SCORPIONS LIVE IN THE CANYONS, AND ALL OF THEM STING. THE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE NUMBNESS, A TIGHTENING OF THE THROAT, AND SHARP PAINS. WITHOUT MEDICATION, THEY CAN BE DEADLY. LOOK AT THIS CAVE -- THE PERFECT PLACE IF YOU HAD TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE. I FEEL MILES FROM ANYWHERE, BUT I CAN SEE THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE ME. JUST LOOK AT THE ROOF OF THIS -- COVERED IN ALL OF THIS, LIKE, SOOT FROM LOADS OF FIRES. AND YOU'VE GOT A SHELF. LOOK, YOU SEE THIS, LIKE, HOLE -- THAT'S OBVIOUSLY MAN-MADE. IT'S NO SURPRISE TO FIND SIGNS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY HERE. THE AZTECS ONCE USED THESE CAVES, BUT FOR THE LAST 400 YEARS, THEY'VE BEEN HOME TO THE RARAMURI INDIANS. THEY STILL LIVE HERE TODAY. THESE NOMADIC PEOPLE MOVE FROM CAVE TO CAVE AS THEY TRAVEL THE CANYONS. IF YOU'RE LUCKY, YOU MAY FIND SOMETHING USEFUL THAT'S BEEN LEFT BEHIND. LOOK AT THAT -- A BIT OF WIRE. AND IT MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH, BUT ACTUALLY THERE ARE LOADS OF DIFFERENT THINGS I COULD USE THAT FOR. SO THAT'S GOOD FOR ME. I'M GONNA KEEP HOLD OF THIS. THE CHARCOAL ON THE CAVE ROOF SHOWS THAT MANY FIRES HAVE BEEN LIT HERE BEFORE, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED. IT'LL KEEP OUT THE FREEZING NIGHT AIR. YOU MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A FLINT STRIKER WITH YOU, SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS USE THIS YUCCA TO MAKE A FIRE SAW. AND A FIRE SAW IS JUST A FRICTION FIRE, AND THIS YUCCA IS REALLY GOOD FOR THIS, BECAUSE IT'S LIGHT AND IT'S REALLY DRY WOOD. AND ALL I NEED TO DO IS BREAK IT HERE... THEN REMOVE THE BASE AND START TO SPLIT THE WOOD INTO STRIPS. CUT OUT 2 PIECES ABOUT 12 INCHES LONG. THE SOTOL PLANT GROWS ALL OVER THESE SLOPES, AND THE LEAVES MAKE EXCELLENT CORDAGE. AND I JUST GET THIS LITTLE BIT OF TINDER -- A LITTLE BIT OF DRIED GRASS, PUT IT AGAINST ONE PIECE OF THE YUCCA. BIT OF STONE ON ONE SIDE AND THE SAME ON THE OTHER, SO THERE CAN BE AN AIR FLOW BETWEEN THE TWO BITS OF WOOD. AND PRESS THAT AGAINST ITSELF SO IT'S LIKE THAT, AND THEN JUST BIND THAT. WRAP ONE END TIGHT, DO THE SAME THING AT THE OTHER END, AND THE JOB IS DONE. AND THEN THAT'S THE BOTTOM BIT OF THE FIRE SAW BUILT. AND THEN ALL I DID WITH THIS WAS, AGAIN, JUST PEEL IT AWAY FROM THE MAIN BRANCH, AND THAT THEN ACTS AS A FIRE SAW THAT I ACTUALLY DRIVE WITH TO CREATE THE FRICTION. NOW TO PUT IT TO THE TEST. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO THIS SO THE BASE OF THIS ISN'T GONNA WOBBLE. HERE WE GO. THIS IS PRETTY SOLID THERE NOW. AND I JUST TAKE THE FIRE SAW AND START TO MOVE IT ALONG HERE. GREAT THING ABOUT USING YUCCA -- IT'S GOT THE LOWEST IGNITION TEMPERATURE OF ANY OF THE WOODS AROUND HERE, WHICH MAKES IT IDEAL FOR TRYING TO MAKE A BIT OF AN EMBER. AND THAT'S ALL I NEED -- JUST A LITTLE BIT OF AN EMBER TO DROP BETWEEN THESE TWO BITS OF WOOD INTO THAT TINDER. NOW I BETTER SHUT UP, STOP TALKING, AND GET SAWING. AND, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT TO THIS STAGE, THIS EMBER IS ACTUALLY GONNA KEEP BURNING, SO THE TIME PRESSURE COMES OFF, AND THEN I JUST POKE IT THROUGH THE BOTTOM THERE, TIP IT INTO THERE. ONCE THE EMBER'S SURROUNDED BY A GOOD BUNDLE OF DRIED GRASS, IT LITERALLY GOES UP IN FLAMES. THERE WE GO. WHOA! OKAY, WE'VE GOT FIRE. SO MUCH OF THIS CANYON LAND HERE IS JUST SO REMOTE, AND, FOR ME, JUST SITTING HERE WITH A FIRE GOING AND A VIEW LIKE THIS, REALLY IT JUST FEELS -- JUST FEELS LIKE A REAL PRIVILEGE, YOU KNOW? BUT I KNOW WORKING YOUR WAY THROUGH THIS KIND OF LANDSCAPE IS ALWAYS CHALLENGING. I'M IN COPPER CANYON, MEXICO, I WANT TO GET TO THE CANYON BOTTOM I SHOULD FIND WATER THERE. BUT FIRST I'M GONNA MAKE A BASIC COMPASS FROM A LEAF AND A PIECE OF WIRE. AND ALL I NEED TO DO HERE IS FILL THIS UP, THEN, WITH A LITTLE BIT OF WATER. NOW TO PREPARE THE WIRE. AND I REALLY WANT TO RUB IT LIKE THIS IN MY HAIR. AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS IT MAGNETIZES THE BIT OF WIRE, AND THEN WHEN I PUT IT IN, IT WILL SWING 'ROUND AND POINT TOWARDS MAGNETIC NORTH, GIVING ME THAT NORTH-SOUTH LINE. AND THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH. AND THEN WHAT I DO IS PUT THE LEAF IN... AND DROP THAT ON TOP. AND, YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. THERE YOU GO. GETTING IT TO SWING 'ROUND. FREELY SUSPENDED METAL THAT'S BEEN MAGNETIZED WILL ALWAYS POINT TO MAGNETIC NORTH. THERE YOU GO. AND THAT'S NOW COME STEADY, AND THAT'S GIVING ME A GOOD, RELIABLE NORTH-SOUTH LINE. NOW, I KNOW THE SUN ROSE SOMEWHERE OVER THERE 'CAUSE I DIDN'T SEE IT, SO THAT'S EAST. SO WEST IS SOMEWHERE OVER THERE. AND THIS NORTH-SOUTH LINE MEANS I'M DEFINITELY HEADING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON MY WESTWARD TRACK. SO, I'M GONNA KEEP THIS LITTLE BIT OF WIRE, GET RID OF THE LEAF, DRINK THE WATER... [ SLURPS ] ...AND THEN I'M OUT OF HERE. THE RARAMURI ORIGINALLY FLED HERE TO ESCAPE THE SPANISH CONQUISTADORS. THE DIFFICULT TERRAIN MADE IT THE PERFECT PLACE TO HIDE. OVER CENTURIES, THEY'VE LEARNED HOW TO NAVIGATE THEIR WAY THROUGH THIS TWISTING MAZE OF CANYONS. THEIR ANCIENT TRAILS ARE EVERYWHERE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE ON THAT SCREE SLOPE OVER THERE. THERE'S A LITTLE TRAIL, AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S SNAKING ITS WAY 'ROUND AND THEN DOWN INTO THIS GULLY. MANY OF THESE TRAILS HAVEN'T BEEN USED FOR YEARS. THERE WAS A SCHOOL GROUP ACTUALLY OUT HERE RECENTLY WHO WERE FOLLOWING ONE OF THESE TRAILS DOWN INTO THE CANYONS. AND SOME OF THE GIRLS GOT SEPARATED FROM THE GROUP, END UP FOLLOWING THE WRONG TRAIL DOWN. AND BY THE TIME THE TEACHER NOTICED THEY WERE MISSING, THEY WERE LOST. AND THE GIRLS WERE DRESSED JUST IN SHORTS AND A T-SHIRT, AND THE NIGHT OUT HERE CAN GET BELOW FREEZING. AND THEY MOUNTED A MASSIVE SEARCH-AND-RESCUE OPERATION, AND EVENTUALLY A DAY LATER THEY DID FIND THEM ALIVE. THOSE SCHOOLGIRLS WERE LUCKY. AH, LOOK. THIS TRAIL HAS BROUGHT ME DOWN OVER HALF A VERTICAL MILE, AND IT'S LED ME TO A RIVER. BUT IT THEN COMES TO AN ABRUPT STOP AT THE TOP OF A SHEER CLIFF. LET'S HAVE A LITTLE LOOK DOWN HERE. YEAH, I RECKON I CAN GET DOWN THIS. IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT TIGHT. THERE'S LOOSE ROCK EVERYWHERE. IT'S VITAL TO TEST EVERY BOULDER BEFORE YOU GO BELOW THEM. THAT'S WHY WE GOT TO WATCH OUR FOOTING, GUYS. THE SLOPE'S STEEP, ABOUT 60 DEGREES, AND IT'D BE EASY TO SLIP. AFTER A 100-FOOT SCRAMBLE, I'M DOWN. AH, THIS IS PERFECT. LOOK AT THIS. IT'S LIKE A LITTLE SLICE OF HEAVEN. AND THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY FROM IT. THAT TERRAIN UP THERE IS JUST TOUGH. ALL OF THAT LOOSE VOLCANIC ROCK. AND IT'S ALSO MUCH COLDER -- THIS IS WARM DOWN HERE. AND I'VE GOT THE SUN AND SOME WATER. AND I'M GONNA JUST TAKE MY SOCKS OFF. [ GRUNTS ] AND TAKE FIVE MINUTES. [ GROANS LIGHTLY ] I MAY BE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CANYON, BUT MY NEXT CHALLENGE IS A WATERFALL. I'M IN MEXICO, HEADING FOR THE EL CHEPE RAILWAY LINE, WHICH RUNS THROUGH COPPER CANYON SOMEWHERE TO THE WEST. AND NOW I'VE REACHED A RIVER, I'VE ENDLESS SUPPLY OF WATER. THE ONLY THING ABOUT THIS CANYON IS THAT I'M COMPLETELY JUST HEMMED IN BY THESE WALLS ON ALL SIDES. AND AT THE MOMENT, WHICHEVER WAY THE CANYON GOES, I'VE GOT TO GO, AS WELL. AND AT THE MOMENT, IT IS GOING WEST. THAT'S FINE FOR NOW. WHOA! THAT'S A WATERFALL. THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DOWNCLIMB -- DOWNCLIMB THAT. YOU SEE THOSE TREES? JUST THERE AGAINST THE CLIFF? I MIGHT WELL BE ABLE TO CLIMB DOWN THE EDGE OF THOSE, THROUGH THE TREE. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. I RECKON THIS IS -- THIS IS DOABLE HERE. AND I CAN SEE WHERE THE TREE RUNS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE CLIFF. THESE CYPRESS TREES ARE GREAT TO CLIMB IN JUST BECAUSE THEIR ROOT SYSTEMS ARE REALLY STRONG. THEY GROW OUT AND THEY, LIKE, CLING INTO THE ROCK FACE. SO I'M GONNA GIVE THIS A GO. I TELL YOU WHAT -- THERE'S QUITE A HEALTHY DROP STRAIGHT DOWN. IT'S OVER 60 FOOT TO THE BOTTOM. A FALL HERE WOULD BE SERIOUS, SO YOU MUST CHECK EACH AND EVERY STEP BEFORE YOU PUT YOUR FULL WEIGHT ON THE TREE. AND WHAT I WANT TO WATCH OUT FOR IS DEAD BRANCHES. LOOK AT THIS. WHOA! LIVE CYPRESS BRANCHES WILL HAVE A HEALTHY COVERING OF BARK AND A GLOSSY SHEEN TO THEM. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS THAT THIS CAVE IS, LIKE, BECOMING OVERHANGING, AND SUDDENLY I'M A BIT MORE AWARE OF JUST THE EXPOSURE BENEATH IT. THE SUN CAN'T GET IN HERE BELOW THE OVERHANG, AND THIS COULD REALLY HELP ME. NONE OF THE BRANCHES ARE GROWING AT THE BACK AGAINST THE CLIFF. THEY'RE ALL GROWING OUT TOWARDS THE SUN, WHICH MEANS I CAN CLIMB DOWN MUCH EASIER. AND AS I DESCEND, THE BRANCHES BECOME THICKER AND THE TREE MORE STABLE. NOW I CAN MOVE FAST. WELL, I'M DOWN. AND THAT WAS FUN. AND LOOK AT THAT FOR A VIEW. BEYOND THE WATERFALL, THE CANYON WALLS BECOME SHEER. THERE'S NO WAY OUT. THIS WOULD BE BAD NEWS FOR YOU. ALMOST 40 INCHES OF RAIN COULD FALL IN A DAY HERE. WITHIN MINUTES, THE STEEP CANYON SIDES CHANNEL THIS MASS OF WATER STRAIGHT INTO THE RIVER. SO FLASH FLOOD'S A REAL THREAT. THIS BUSH HERE SHOWS JUST HOW HIGH THE WATER LEVEL CAN REACH. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT, BUT ALL OF THIS IS BENT OVER JUST BY THE FORCE OF THE WATER. THIS MUST BE 10, MAYBE 15 FOOT ABOVE WHERE IT IS NOW. JUST IMAGINE THIS CANYON -- IF YOU LOOK DOWN THERE, ALL OF THESE ROCKS WOULD BE UNDERWATER. THIS WOULD JUST BE A RAGING TORRENT, CLIFFS ON EITHER SIDE, AND, LITERALLY, THIS PLACE WOULD BE A DEATHTRAP. EVEN IF IT'S CLEAR WHERE YOU ARE, 30 MILES AWAY, THE RAIN COULD BE POURING DOWN. A 15-FOOT WALL OF WATER FULL OF BOULDERS AND TREES WILL THUNDER DOWNSTREAM AT 60 MILES AN HOUR AND WILL HIT WITH LITTLE WARNING. AND THE FIRST YOU'RE GONNA KNOW ABOUT IT IS YOU'RE GONNA HEAR A DISTANT RUMBLE LIKE A JET ENGINE, AND THEN IT'S GONNA HIT YOU. AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY A GUY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHO WAS FISHING NEARBY HERE, AND HE WAS WITH HIS SON AND WITH HIS NIECE. AND HE KNEW THIS AREA REALLY WELL, BUT A FLASH FLOOD CAME AND HIT, AND IT TOOK THEM. AND HE MANAGED TO TURN AND REACH, GRAB HIS SON. BY THE TIME HE TURNED AROUND AGAIN, HIS NIECE WAS GONE, AND SHE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN. AND THAT'S HOW DANGEROUS THESE SORT OF CANYONS CAN BE WITH FLASH FLOODS. IF YOU'RE TRAVELING DOWNSTREAM, YOU WON'T SEE THE WALL OF WATER COMING. YOU HAVE TO KEEP LISTENING ALL THE TIME. AND IF YOU FEEL THE EARTH START TO TREMBLE, HEAD FOR HIGH GROUND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. SO MANY OF THESE WALLS HERE OF THE CANYONS HAVE JUST BEEN COMPLETELY SHEER AND UNCLIMBABLE. BUT LOOK. YOU SEE THE GAP IN THE RIDGE UP THERE -- AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA SEE WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT. JUST 'CAUSE THE RIVER THAT I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HERE HAS BEEN GREAT -- IT'S BEEN HEADING WEST, BUT, LOOK, IT'S SUDDENLY NOW SKIRTED 'ROUND TO THE SOUTH, WHICH IS NOT WHERE I WANT TO GO. SO LET'S SEE WHAT'S UP HERE. [ GRUNTS ] WOW, THIS IS -- THIS IS WHY THIS PLACE IS JUST SUCH A MAZE. LOOK, IT'S JUST SUDDENLY A WHOLE NEW CANYON HERE. AND, LOOK, YOU SEE THE RIVER THERE ACTUALLY IS SKIRTING 'ROUND AND IS HEADING WESTERLY. SO THIS CANYON IS MUCH BETTER FOR ME. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GO ON THIS ONE. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF SURVIVAL IS STAYING ALERT AND MAKING THE MOST OF OPPORTUNITIES. THAT GAP IN THE RIDGE WOULD SAVE YOU DAYS OF WALKING AND KEEP YOU ON A WESTERLY COURSE. BUT THERE ARE ANY NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. WHOO! I'M IN COPPER CANYON, MEXICO. I'VE DROPPED OVER A VERTICAL MILE INTO THE CANYON BOTTOM. I HAVE WATER NOW, AND IT'S WARMER. BUT THE GROUND IS STREWN WITH HUGE BOULDERS. THIS IS TOUGH TERRAIN. BUT NOW I'M GONNA SHOW YOU A WAY OF CATCHING FISH OUT HERE. SOME TROUT HAVE BEEN PLACED JUST DOWNSTREAM. THERE YOU GO, SEE THEM? JUST DOWN THERE? OKAY, WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUST SEE IF I CAN DAM THIS LITTLE BIT OF STREAM LOWER DOWN AND ALSO THEN UPSTREAM, AND SEE IF I CAN GET -- GET THIS THING. THE DAMS WILL STOP THE FISH ESCAPING, BUT ALWAYS BUILD THE LOWER ONE FIRST. THEY'LL FIND IT HARDER TO SPOT YOU. AND IT NEEDS TO SPAN RIGHT ACROSS THE WATER FLOW. LET'S GO AND DO THE SAME UPSTREAM AND THEN SEE IF I GET THEM. STAY OUT OF SIGHT AS YOU MOVE UPSTREAM, AND ONCE YOUR NEXT DAM IS BUILT, YOU'RE READY TO GO FISHING. WHAT I WANT TO TRY AND DO HERE IS COME DIRECTLY DOWNSTREAM OF WHERE THEY ARE, WHICH IS JUST THERE, AND THEY HAVE A BLIND SPOT JUST BEHIND THEM, AND THEN COME UP AND TRY AND GET THEM WITH THIS STICK. AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT DOING IT LIKE THIS IS THAT EVEN IF I MISS, THE SHOCK WAVES OF THAT IMPACT WILL CONCUSS THEM. HERE THEY ARE. OKAY. SOME SALTWATER FISH ARE POISONOUS, BUT ALL FRESHWATER FISH ARE SAFE TO EAT. ANYTHING OVER THREE INCHES SHOULD BE GUTTED, BECAUSE THEY SPOIL THE FISH AND MAKE IT TASTE HORRID. FINALLY, ONCE THE HEAD AND TAIL ARE REMOVED, WASH THE FISH TO CLEAN OUT THE STOMACH CAVITY. AND THAT IS GOOD TO EAT JUST LIKE THIS -- STRAIGHT OUT OF THE RIVER. FISH CONTAINS HIGH LEVELS OF PROTEIN, WHICH HELPS REPAIR MUSCLE TISSUE, AND IT ALSO BOOSTS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. MMM. I LOVE SUSHI. I DON'T LIKE BONES. I'M AIMING FOR THE EL CHEPE RAILWAY LINE, WHICH RUNS NORTH TO SOUTH THROUGH COPPER CANYON. IT'S JUST ANOTHER OF THESE CAVES. AND LOOK AT THE ROOF UP HERE. YOU CAN JUST SEE IT CAKED WITH CHARCOAL. AND LOOK OVER HERE. THERE'S A DRAWING. LOOK, YOU SEE THIS? THIS LOOKS LIKE -- PROBABLY A RAILWAY LINE, LIKE A -- PROBABLY A MULE OR A DONKEY. LOOK, EVEN A PERSON, AS IF THEY'RE KIND OF WORKING ON IT. AND THIS IS MORE THAN LIKELY GONNA BE REFERRING TO THE EL CHEPE RAILWAY LINE. TO BUILD A RAILWAY LINE THROUGH THESE CANYONS WAS A REMARKABLE FEAT OF ENGINEERING. IT RUNS FOR 400 MILES, CROSSES 36 BRIDGES AND 87 TUNNELS. OPENED IN 1961, IT HAD TAKEN OVER 100 YEARS TO BUILD. HEY, CAN YOU SEE THAT DROPOFF? THERE'S A SERIES OF WATERFALLS AHEAD AND A LOT OF WHITE WATER. AND REALLY, WATERFALLS IN THE WILD JUST CAN BE KILLERS, AND YOU WANT TO AVOID THEM, REALLY, AT ALL COSTS. THE DANGER, THOUGH, IS JUST HIDDEN ROCKS, NOT SEEING WHAT'S IN ALL THAT WHITE WATER, ALL THAT TURBULENCE, AND NOT KNOWING HOW DEEP IT IS. I COULD CLIMB MY WAY AROUND THIS WATERFALL, BUT I'M GONNA JUMP STRAIGHT OFF THE TOP TO SHOW YOU THE SAFEST TECHNIQUE. THE DROP IS OVER 25 FOOT HIGH. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THE WATER'S DEEPER THAN 12 FOOT, OR YOU'LL HIT THE BOTTOM. YOU'LL NEED A DEPTH GAUGE. AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE STRING, NATURE HAS THE ANSWER -- YUCCA LEAVES. ALL I DO IS BITE INTO IT. ONE... TWO. GRAB THIN END TO THIN END, RIGHT OVER LEFT, LEFT OVER RIGHT. THIS PROCESS IS FAST, AND WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THE CREW, I'VE MADE ALMOST 50 FOOT OF ROPE. THE NEXT STEP IS TO SMOOTH THE EDGES OF THE ROCK SO IT DOESN'T CUT THE YUCCA LEAF, THEN SECURE IT WITH A HITCH KNOT. AND THAT THEN IS READY TO GO. HERE, I'VE GOT THE ROCK AND THIS LENGTH OF CORD. IF I DROP THIS IN, WHEN IT'S ON THE BOTTOM, I'LL KNOW HOW DEEP IT IS HERE. OKAY, IT'S ON THE BOTTOM NOW, AND EVERY ARM LENGTH I PULL BACK WILL BE ABOUT THREE FEET, WILL TELL ME HOW DEEP IT IS. WHEN I SEE THE ROCK, I KNOW THAT'S THE DEPTH. ONE. TWO. THREE. FOUR. FIVE. OKAY, THAT'S 5 ARM LENGTHS FOR ABOUT 15 FOOT, WHICH IS FINE TO JUMP. YOU KNOW, I'VE MADE THE MISTAKE BEFORE OF DOING A BIG SEA-CLIFF JUMP AND REALLY INJURING MYSELF, BRUISING ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEGS. AND IT'S A MISTAKE I'LL ONLY MAKE ONCE. SO I WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT. I'M GONNA JUMP WITH MY FEET TOGETHER AND BEYOND THAT WHITE STUFF. SO HERE GOES. WHOO! THE WATER'S CLOSE TO FREEZING, AND THE CURRENT'S RAGING, BUT THE WAY OUT IS TO CORKSCREW. IT'S THE BEST TECHNIQUE FOR GETTING OUT OF STRONG CURRENTS. [ GRUNTS ] THAT WAS QUITE BRACING. BUT IT WORKED, AND I DIDN'T HIT THE BOTTOM. BUT I'M DRENCHED, AND I'M COLD. I NEED TO GET A FIRE GOING. AS MY CLOTHES DRY, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO SET UP CAMP. WHEN THERE ARE NO CAVES AROUND, THE RARAMURI USE SMOKE BLANKETS TO KEEP WARM. WHAT I'M GONNA DO HERE IS JUST BUILD A SECOND FIRE OVER HERE FROM THE EMBERS OF THIS ONE. AND THE IDEA IS, YOU COULD, IF YOU NEEDED TO, SLEEP IN BETWEEN THESE FIRES. THESE CYPRESS BRANCHES WILL BE COMFY TO LIE ON. DIG A TRENCH BETWEEN THE FIRES TO PUT THEM IN. THIS WILL STOP YOU ROLLING OUT INTO THE FLAMES. AND THEN INTO THAT... YOU HAVE TO PUT ALL OF THIS CYPRESS. THAT'S GONNA BE NICE AND INSULATED TO LIE ON. THEN SURROUND THEM WITH STONES TO STOP THE CYPRESS CATCHING FIRE. OKAY, GIVE IT A TEST. AH. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE IN THAT RIVER AND THEN WITHIN 20 MINUTES, BE REALLY WARM. AH, THIS IS HEAVEN. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] I'M IN MEXICO, AND I'M NOW DEEP INTO THE COPPER CANYON. I'M HEADING WEST TOWARDS THE EL CHEPE RAILWAY LINE. BUT MAKE SURE YOU ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BEARINGS. ONE WAY OF WORKING OUT YOUR DIRECTION IN THESE CANYONS IS JUST USE THE SUN AND ITS SHADOW. AND IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE, THE SUN WILL ALWAYS TRAVEL ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SKY, WHICH MEANS THE SHADOWS WILL NEVER FACE SOUTH. SO IF I LOOK AT THAT FACE OVER THERE, YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THAT IS IN SHADE, WHICH MEANS THAT NORTH MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THIS SKY HERE, WHICH MEANS, ALSO, THE WEST MUST BE SOMEWHERE IN THIS DIRECTION. AND THAT'S THE WAY I'M HEADING. I'M ON MY WESTERLY COURSE TOWARDS THE EL CHEPE RAILWAY LINE, BUT GRADUALLY, THE CANYON BENDS TO THE NORTH -- THE WRONG WAY. TO KEEP GOING WEST, YOU'LL NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS CANYON, AND TO DO THAT, YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP THERE. BUT THOSE WALLS ARE VERTICAL. A FAMILY RECENTLY GOT STUCK IN A CANYON, AND ON THEIR SECOND DAY, THEY SPOTTED A SMALL VILLAGE JUST OVER THE CANYON RIM. BUT THEY COULDN'T REACH IT BECAUSE NONE OF THEM COULD CLIMB. EVENTUALLY THEY STUMBLED ACROSS AN ANIMAL TRAIL AND GOT OUT. THEY'D BEEN IN THERE FOR FIVE DAYS. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT, BUT IT'S LIKE A CRACK IN THE ROCK WHERE THE SHADOW IS. BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL FROM DOWN HERE. BUT MY DAD ALWAYS USED TO SAY WHEN WE WERE CLIMBING, "YOU CAN NEVER TELL HOW STEEP SOMETHING IS UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY RUB NOSES WITH IT." SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO. THIS DEEP CUT IS THE RESULT OF THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF WATER EROSION. IT'S A WEAK POINT IN THE ROCK. CLIMBERS OFTEN LOOK FOR THESE, AS THEY CAN BE A WAY UP AN OTHERWISE IMPENETRABLE FACE. YEAH, LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A CHIMNEY CLIMB UP. I JUST NEED TO GET PAST THIS FIRST BIG BOULDER HERE. CHIMNEY CLIMBS ARE WHERE A ROCK FACE HAS TWO OPPOSING WALLS, AND TO CLIMB THEM TAKES A LOT OF PRACTICE. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] WEDGE YOURSELF IN AND THEN PLACE ONE FOOT ON EACH WALL, AND USE THOSE TO PUSH YOURSELF UP. CLIMBING LIKE THIS IS ALL ABOUT BALANCE AND JUST USING OPPOSING FORCES. SO [GRUNTS] ONE FOOT ON ONE WALL AND ONE ON THE OTHER, AND THEN USE MY LEG STRENGTH TO LIFT ME UP AND MY ARMS JUST TO BALANCE. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] AH. I'M GETTING QUITE HIGH UP THIS NOW... BUT WE'RE ABOUT 3/4 OF THE WAY. I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A SECOND TO REST. BUT I'M IN A GOOD POSITION HERE. I'VE GOT MY LEGS TAKING ALL OF MY WEIGHT, AND ACTUALLY I DON'T EVEN NEED MY HANDS. AND IT JUST GIVES ME A CHANCE TO GET THE BLOOD BACK, GET MY BREATH BACK. AND I'M GOING TO DO THIS LAST LITTLE BIT. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ GRUNTS ] AND, ALSO, UP HERE, IT'S NOW GETTING REALLY WET AND SLIPPY, SO I JUST NEED TO WATCH WHERE I'M PUTTING MY FEET. I CAN SEE DAYLIGHT AT THE TOP. THERE'S A SMALL GAP. IT'S MY ONLY WAY OUT, BUT IT'S GONNA BE A TIGHT SQUEEZE. [ GRUNTING ] WHOO! I'M THROUGH! I'M OUT OF THAT HOLE... AND OUT OF THIS CANYON. LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S JUST SPECTACULAR. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] I'M JUST GONNA TAKE TWO MINUTES TO GET MY BREATH BACK AND ENJOY THIS. I'VE COME DOWN STEEP MOUNTAINS AND THROUGH TREACHEROUS CANYONS, AND NOW I FIND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF LUSH PINE FOREST. I CAN REALLY START TO MOVE FAST NOW, BUT EVEN MY PACE IS NOTHING COMPARED TO THE RARAMURI. THEY'RE KNOWN AS THE RUNNING PEOPLE, AND THEY CAN TRAVEL OVER 100 MILES WITHOUT STOPPING. AND JOURNEYS THAT TAKE THEM HOURS WOULD TAKE ANYBODY ELSE DAYS. ONE OF THE WAY THAT THE RARAMURI HUNT IS JUST TO CHASE ANIMALS OVER VAST DISTANCES, AND THIS EVEN WORKS WITH DEER. THEY'D JUST RUN AND THEN RUN TILL EVENTUALLY THE ANIMAL WOULD TIRE AND WOULD SLOW DOWN, AND THE RARAMURI WOULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO STONE IT AND KILL IT. AND JUST IMAGINE THE SORT OF STAMINA INVOLVED TO DO THAT. YOU STAND NO CHANCE OF OUTRUNNING A DEER, SO IF YOU WANT TO EAT, YOU'LL NEED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT BE AS TASTY, BUT IS A LOT EASIER TO CATCH. HAVE YOU EVER TRIED BEETLE LARVAE? THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF PLACE THEY LIKE -- UNDERNEATH THESE SORT OF OAK SCRUBS, AND WHAT HAPPENS, ALL THE LEAVES FALL OFF, AND THIS PROVIDES GOOD INSULATION FOR THESE LARVAE. BUT I CAN TELL THIS IS A BEETLE LARVA JUST 'CAUSE THE SHAPE OF ITS HEAD. IT WILL HAVE THE SAME HEAD WHEN IT'S AN ADULT. AND ALSO ITS PINCERS, YOU CAN SEE THERE. AND THAT'S WHAT IT WILL USE TO EAT THE LEAVES. BUT YOU CAN SEE HERE ALL THIS BROWN GUNK, AS WELL. AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S BEEN EATING. BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY EDIBLE, GOOD PROTEIN. LOOKS PRETTY HORRIBLE, WILL PROBABLY TASTE PRETTY HORRIBLE. BUT IT'S WORTH HAVING. OH, GOD. I GOT AN EXPLOSION OF GOO IN MY MOUTH. BUT IT ACTUALLY TASTED LIKE DIRT, AND, ALSO, A BIT OAKY, IT'S GETTING DARK NOW, BUT ALWAYS KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR PEOPLE. THE SIDE OF THE HILL THERE -- SOME PEOPLE. AND THOSE ARE RARAMURI. I CAN TELL THAT FROM THEIR BRIGHTLY COLORED CLOTHING. IT MIGHT NOT BE A RAILWAY TRACK, BUT IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. COPPER CANYON IS A VAST AND INTIMIDATING WILDERNESS TO BE LOST IN, AND IT LEAVES ME WITH A SENSE OF AWE AT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEARNED TO LIVE AND SURVIVE HERE AND CALL IT THEIR HOME.
