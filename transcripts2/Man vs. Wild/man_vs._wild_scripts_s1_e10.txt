 Man vs. Wild (2006â€“2020): Season 1, Episode 10 - Everglades - full transcript 
 This premiere episode finds host Bear Grylls stranded in the swamps of the Florida Everglades, where each year at least 60 tourists need to be rescued. With more than a million alligators, thousands of snakes and even black bears roaming these waterlogged lands, the area has more than its share of hazards. Bear demonstrates how to keep alligators at bay, deal with vicious razor-sharp grass and find stomach-churning food that will keep you alive if you find yourself stranded in this beautiful but dangerous destination.

 I'M BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES, I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, AND CROSSED THE FROZEN WATERS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN THE ALLIGATOR-INFESTED SWAMPS OF THE EVERGLADES. EVERY YEAR, OVER 60 TOURISTS NEED TO BE RESCUED FROM ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS. THIS PLACE IS UNFORGIVING. I'M IN THE EVERGLADES IN FLORIDA, OVER 4,000 SQUARE MILES OF WATERLOGGED GRASSLAND.

 EVERY YEAR, THIS WILDERNESS ATTRACTS 6 MILLION VISITORS. MANY GET LOST AND NEED TO BE AIRLIFTED TO SAFETY. I'M GONNA PUT MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF A LOST TOURIST AND SHOW YOU HOW TO SURVIVE IN A WILDERNESS LIKE THIS. THE EVERGLADES WAS FORMED BY A 50-MILE-WIDE RIVER FLOWING FROM MID-FLORIDA DOWN TO THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE SWAMPS, FORESTS, AND MARSHES HAVE REMAINED ALMOST UNCHANGED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS, AND THERE IS NO OTHER AREA LIKE IT IN THE U.S. THAT'S WHY MILLIONS COME HERE. LAST YEAR, 65 PEOPLE WERE RESCUED. MANY HAD BECOME STRANDED AFTER THEIR BOATS HAD BROKEN DOWN. I'M STARTING IN THE MOST CHALLENGING PART OF THE EVERGLADES -- THE SWAMPS.

 WE'RE HOVERING AT ABOUT 100 FOOT ABOVE THE GROUND NOW, AND THE TREES ARE STILL ABOUT 40 FOOT BENEATH ME. 3, 2, 1. GO. THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HABITAT HERE, NOT JUST SWAMP, AND I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO SURVIVE IN EACH OF THEM. THOUGH THERE ARE ROADS CROSSING THE EVERGLADES, IT'S SO EASY TO GET LOST HERE, AND IF YOU DO GET LOST, YOU CAN DIE. I'LL BE RECEIVING SOME HELP IF NEEDED FROM LOCAL EXPERTS ALONG THE WAY, AND A FILM CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. [ BREATHES HEAVILY ] I TELL YOU, I DON'T LIKE THIS STUFF AT ALL. YOU JUST CAN'T SEE WHAT IS IN THE WATER. THERE IS WATER AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. IT'S UP TO MY THIGHS, AND IT'S DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE BIG ALLIGATORS. THERE ARE OVER 1 MILLION OF THEM IN THE EVERGLADES, AND THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD NEED IS A WEAPON. I'M JUST GONNA CUT THIS POP ASH DOWN HERE AND USE THIS AS A STICK. AND WHAT YOU DO IS BEND IT OVER, PUT IT UNDER TENSION... ...AND LET IT ALL COME OFF LIKE THAT. IT'S NOT MUCH OF A WEAPON, BUT THIS STICK WILL GIVE ME AN EXTRA 4 FEET OF REACH TO WARD OFF ANY ALLIGATORS. JUST LOOK AT THIS PLACE. IT'S SO DISORIENTATING. AND I THINK OUT OF ALL THE WILDERNESSES I'VE EVER BEEN IN, THIS HAS TO BE THE EASIEST PLACE TO GET LOST IN. IT'S JUST MORE OF THE SAME IN EVERY DIRECTION. AND THERE'S A COUPLE WHO GOT STUCK OUT HERE RECENTLY WHEN THEIR AIRBOAT HIT A TREE AND BROKE A GAS LINE. AND EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD A CELLPHONE AND COULD CALL SEARCH AND RESCUE, THEY HAD NO IDEA WHERE THEY WERE. AND IT ACTUALLY TOOK SEARCH AND RESCUE TWO DAYS TO FIND THEM. AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WHY. THEY SURVIVED BY STAYING IN THEIR AIRBOAT, AND THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. BUT THE OTHER THING YOU CAN DO IS TRY TO FIND DRY LAND. I FIRST OF ALL NEED TO GET MY BEARINGS. THIS TREE HERE SHOULD DO. IT'S HIGH ENOUGH. IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT 40 FOOT TO THE TOP OF THAT, SHOULD GIVE ME A VIEW OVER THE TOP OF THE REST OF THE SWAMP, BUT ALSO IS THIN ENOUGH TO ALLOW ME TO CLIMB UP THIS THING. BUT THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO JUST FREE-CLIMB UP THIS. BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS USE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS JUST MY SHOELACES. AND ALL I GOT TO DO IS UNTIE EACH OF THESE AND THEN TIE THEM TOGETHER SO I'VE GOT ONE LONG LOOP. AND I WANT TO DO IT IN A BOW 'CAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDO THESE THINGS AT THE END. THIS IS GONNA GET REALLY TIGHT NOW. BUT ONCE I'VE GOT THIS LOOPED, MY FEET ARE JOINED TOGETHER. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THESE TO JUMP AND THEN WRAP 'ROUND THE TREE. AND THAT WILL GIVE ME ENOUGH TRACTION TO GO UP. AND THE KEY TO DOING THIS IS TO JUST KEEP CALM AND NOT RUSH IT AND USE YOUR LEG STRENGTH TO LIFT YOU UP, AND YOUR ARMS ARE THERE PURELY JUST TO BALANCE. OKAY, SO I'M REALLY QUITE HIGH UP HERE. I HOPE THESE LACES ARE HOLDING UP. ANOTHER COUPLE OF FEET, I'LL BE ABOVE IT. [ SIGHS ] THAT'S GREAT. THEY WORKED PERFECTLY. I THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA BREAK ABOUT HALFWAY. THIS IS AS HIGH AS I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GET UP THIS TREE. IT'S GETTING REALLY SPINDLY AND WOBBLY. WHAT YOU'D BE HOPING FOR IS TO GET A GLIMPSE OF SOME PINE TREES, JUST BECAUSE THEY GROW ON DRY GROUND. BUT INSTEAD IT'S JUST CYPRESS AND WATER OAK, AND THAT MEANS SWAMP AND MORE SWAMP. WITHOUT ANY DRY LAND TO HEAD FOR, YOU'LL NEED ANOTHER PLAN. ONE OF THE KEY PARTS OF SURVIVAL IS PREPARATION AND HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOGRAPHY THAT YOU'RE IN. AND I KNOW THAT IN THE EVERGLADES, BASICALLY INLAND IS HIGHER GROUND. AND THAT, I KNOW, IS TO THE WEST. AND ONE WAY I CAN WORK THIS OUT IS JUST BY USING MY WATCH AS A COMPASS. AND IF I JUST POINT THE HOUR HAND AT THE SUN, WHICH IS OVER THERE, HALFWAY BETWEEN THAT AND 12:00 IS SOUTH, WHICH MEAN SOUTH'S THAT WAY. WEST, INLAND, HIGHER GROUND, IS THAT WAY. GRAB A STICK, AND I'M OUT OF HERE. ONCE YOU'VE DECIDED ON THE RIGHT DIRECTION, IT'S VITAL TO STICK TO YOUR BEARINGS. IT WOULD BE SO EASY TO GO AROUND IN CIRCLES HERE. THESE SWAMPS ARE SO DISORIENTATING. YOU'VE GOT TO TRY AND CONSERVE YOUR ENERGY. THIS IS WHY THIS SWAMP IS SO DIFFICULT. LOOK. THERE'S LOADS OF THESE SUBMERGED LOGS, AND IT JUST MAKES MOVING SO DIFFICULT. THESE SWAMPS ARE SO FORBIDDING. ANYTHING COULD BE LURKING UNDER THE WATER. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE STEPPING ON. HEY, THERE ARE BUBBLES. GET UP. GET ON THAT TREE. GET OUT OF THE WATER. OUT OF THE WATER, RIGHT OUT, RIGHT OUT. I'M IN THE EVERGLADES. IT'S HOME TO MILLIONS OF SNAKES AND ALLIGATORS, AND DANGER IS NEVER FAR AWAY. LOOK, YOU SEE THAT? LOOK. SEE THE BUBBLES COMING OUT OF THE -- NOW, THAT COULD EITHER BE AN ALLIGATOR OR JUST THE GASES COMING OUT OF THE SWAMPS. WE JUST STAY HERE AND JUST WATCH IT FOR A SECOND. WE JUST NEED TO KEEP CALM AND NOT TAKE THE RISK. WE'RE GONNA BACK OUT THIS WAY AND GO 'ROUND. SO JUST QUIETLY GET BACK INTO THE WATER AND BACK AWAY. THIS PLACE IS SPOOKY. THERE COULD BE ALLIGATORS ANYWHERE. THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS TO MAKE LOTS OF NOISE AND SPLASH AROUND AND LET THEM KNOW THAT YOU'RE COMING. THE LAST THING YOU WANT TO DO IS TO SURPRISE ONE, AS THEY'RE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO ATTACK IF THEY THINK THEY'VE GOT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. THE TREES FORM A THICK SCREEN. BUT THEN THERE IS A CLEARING WITH SOME SORT OF DEEP WATER IN MY PATH. EXACTLY THE KIND OF SPOT WHERE YOU COULD EXPECT TO FIND ALLIGATORS THERE'S AN OLD ALLIGATORS' NEST. AND, YEAH, YOU SEE THE SLIDE? THIS IS WHERE THEIR MOTHER WOULD COME IN, AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DO -- THEY BUILD UP THIS SORT OF MOUND FOR ALL OF THE EGGS THAT SHE'D LAY. AND SHE'LL TYPICALLY LAY PROBABLY ABOUT 30 OR 40 OF THESE EGGS, BUT ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THAT WILL ACTUALLY HATCH. IF THIS WAS A FRESH NEST, THERE'S NO WAY I'D BE ABLE TO GET THIS CLOSE. I'VE GOT HOLD OF A BABY ALLIGATOR TO SHOW YOU. THIS LITTLE FELLOW IS PROTECTED, SO IF YOU COME ACROSS ONE, DON'T EAT IT. [ ALLIGATOR SQUEAKING ] AAH. LOOK AT THIS. AND THIS GUY IS PROBABLY A COUPLE OF YEARS OLD. OFTEN IF THERE ARE A LOT OF BIG MALE ALLIGATORS AROUND, THEY'LL EAT THESE LITTLE GUYS. BUT, WOW, THAT IS JUST PURE MUSCLE. I CAN JUST FEEL THE POWER EVEN JUST HOLDING IT LIKE THIS. AND JUST IMAGINE HOW STRONG IT WOULD BE IF IT WAS LIKE -- YOU KNOW, A BIG ONE WOULD BE LIKE A HUNDRED TIMES THIS SIZE. AMAZING TO SEE -- AND THOSE TEETH ARE JUST LIKE RAZOR-SHARP. AND IN THIS SORT OF SWAMP, IT IS JUST INEVITABLE THAT I EVENTUALLY COME ACROSS SOME OF THESE GUYS. BUT ACTUALLY THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF PLACE THEY'D LIKE. IT'S A CLEARING, WHICH MEANS THE SUNLIGHT COMES DOWN. THEY'RE COLD-BLOODED. THEY NEED THE SUN TO KEEP THEM WARM. AND LOOK, THERE ARE A FEW OF THEM, AS IF THEY'RE LIKE RECHARGING THEIR BATTERIES IN THE SUN HERE. BUT THERE'S NO WAY THAT I WANT TO BE WADING ACROSS THE CHANNEL. WE NEED ANOTHER PLAN FOR GETTING ACROSS. COME ON. A FALLEN TREE PROVIDES A POSSIBLE WAY ACROSS. AND YOU GET LOADS OF THESE TREES FALLING DOWN IN HURRICANES. THEY'VE HAD LIKE SEVEN HURRICANES HERE IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS. BUT, YEAH, THERE ARE STILL ALLIGATORS AROUND HERE, SO I WANT TO BE CAREFUL. I'M GONNA GO FOR IT, THROW THIS ACROSS. KEV, YOU STAY HERE. DEADWOOD IS OFTEN WEAK. BUT THIS IS A CYPRESS TREE. THERE ARE NO LOWER BRANCHES, AND IT HAS VERTICAL GROOVES IN THE BARK. AND BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN WATER, THE WOOD TAKE YEARS TO ROT. IT SHOULD BE SAFE. WHAT I'M DOING IS JUST USING MY THIGHS TO GRIP AND THEN THE TOP OF MY FEET TO PUSH ME UP. BUT IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT TRYING TO KEEP YOUR BALANCE ON THIS THING 'CAUSE IT'S GETTING THINNER AS I GET HIGHER. UGH! TWO REASONS WHY I DON'T WANT TO FALL OFF THIS -- ONE, LOOK, IT'S GETTING PRETTY HIGH. BUT ALSO THAT THE ALLIGATOR'S THERE, AND I DO NOT WANT TO END UP AS ALLIGATOR FOOD. I'VE JUST GOT TO WORK OUT A WAY OF GETTING TO THE MAIN TREE AND GETTING DOWN THAT. I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO SWING OVER, I THINK. JUST GOT TO TRY AND GET MY LEG AROUND HERE. IT'S LATE, AND YOU'D NEED TO GET OUT OF THE WATER BEFORE NIGHTFALL. THAT'S WHEN THE ALLIGATORS BECOME MORE ACTIVE. IT'S THEIR MAIN FEEDING TIME, SO YOU'D NEED TO SET UP CAMP. I COULD PROBABLY USE THIS POP ASH TREE HERE. IT'S GOT ENOUGH LIMBS OFF THE BRANCHES. AND WHAT I CAN DO IS IF I FIND A FEW MORE UPRIGHTS LIKE THIS, LASH ONE LIKE THAT AND THEN ANOTHER ONE HERE AND THEN LAY SOME BRANCHES ALONG IT. THAT WILL LIFT ME UP OUT OF THE WATER. AND THE OTHER GOOD THING ABOUT THIS POP ASH -- IT'S GOT LOTS OF VINE ON IT, WHICH I CAN USE JUST AS NATURAL CORDAGE TO TIE IT WITH. BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE WOOD IS THICK ENOUGH TO TAKE YOUR WEIGHT. WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE IS JUST DO LIKE A SIMPLE OVERHAND KNOT AND THEN TUCK IT IN AGAIN ONCE MORE ON ITSELF, AND THAT JUST LOCKS IT. THIS PROCESS TAKES TIME, SO I'LL GET SOME HELP FROM THE CREW, BUT ALL THE RAW MATERIALS ARE AROUND ME. CONSTRUCT A BASE TO SLEEP ON. IT SHOULD BE LONG ENOUGH TO LIE ON FULL-STRETCH AND WIDE. THIS IS ONE BED YOU DON'T WANT TO ROLL OUT OF. IDEALLY, PICK STRAIGHT TIMBERS AND REMOVE THE OFFSHOOTS. THEY'LL DIG IN AND MAKE SLEEPING EVEN HARDER. NOW I JUST NEED A LOAD OF THESE ACROSS HERE, AND THIS WILL MAKE A GOOD PLATFORM. RIGHT, THAT'S ALMOST ENOUGH. NOW TO PAD THIS BED OUT A BIT. LOOK AT THIS STUFF. THIS IS ALL SPANISH MOSS. AND EVEN THOUGH THIS LOOKS REALLY NICE AND SOFT AND YOU'D THINK IT WOULD MAKE AN IDEAL MATTRESS, IT'S ACTUALLY OFTEN FULL OF NASTY, LITTLE CHIGGERS. AND CHIGGERS ARE THESE TINY, LITTLE THINGS YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY SEE. BUT WHAT HAPPENS -- THEY BITE YOU, AND THEN 24 HOURS LATER, YOU'LL START TO SCRATCH, AND YOU'RE GONNA KEEP SCRATCHING FOR DAYS. AND I'VE COME ACROSS THIS BEFORE IN THE JUNGLES OF BELIZE, AND, TRUST ME, IT'S A MISTAKE YOU ONLY MAKE ONCE. SO I'M GONNA NEED ANOTHER PLAN FOR SOMETHING TO USE AS BEDDING. THE FRONDS OF THE CABBAGE PALM ARE MUCH BETTER. THIS PALM IS THE STATE PLANT OF FLORIDA AND HAS BEEN USED FOR SHELTER BY THE LOCAL SEMINOLE TRIBE HERE FOR CENTURIES. ONCE A BED IS MADE, FIRE IS THE NEXT PRIORITY. IT WILL HELP KEEP PREDATORS AWAY AND ALSO DRY YOUR CLOTHES. BUT TO LIGHT IT, I'D NEED TO FIND SOME TINDER, AND ONCE AGAIN, THE CABBAGE PALM IS A KEY. THIS STUFF IS GREAT. IT'S REALLY, REALLY DRY AND STAYS PRETTY DRY EVEN WHEN IT'S BEEN RAINING. AND YOU DO HAVE TO BE A LITTLE BIT CAREFUL REACHING AROUND IN THIS STUFF JUST BECAUSE LOADS OF NASTY CREEPY-CRAWLIES OFTEN LIVE IN THIS, FROM ANTS TO SCORPIONS. AND I'VE EVEN GOT A FRIEND WHO FOUND ONCE A CORAL SNAKE WRAPPED UP IN THIS SORT OF STUFF. SO I'M GONNA STUFF THIS IN MY POCKET. IT'S ABOUT THE ONLY PLACE ON ME THAT'S DRY. MAKE A BASE FOR THE FIRE, OR THE EMBERS WILL BURN YOUR BED. YOU SHOULD LET THE MUD DRY, BUT YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE TIME. HOWEVER, THESE GREEN TWIGS WILL CREATE A BARRIER BETWEEN THE TINDER AND THE WET MUD. IT WOULD BE EASY TO THINK THAT STARTING A FIRE IN SUCH A WET AND HUMID ENVIRONMENT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE. BUT THIS SHOWS HOW A LITTLE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. I REALLY NEED TO WATCH OUT FOR MY FEET. JUST IN THIS SORT OF ENVIRONMENT, IT'S REALLY EASY TO GET TRENCH FOOT. AND YOU GET TRENCH FOOT IF YOUR FEET ARE WET FOR MORE THAN ABOUT 12 HOURS. AND IT'S A MIX OF JUST BEING COLD AND MOIST. AND WHAT HAPPENS -- EVENTUALLY THE SKIN STARTS TO FLAKE OFF, AND IT CAN THEN BECOME INFECTED. BUT I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE I DON'T GET THAT, 'CAUSE I TELL YOU, OUT HERE, IF YOU CAN'T WALK, YOU DIE. I'M IN THE EVERGLADES, AND THE MOSQUITOES OUT HERE ARE FEROCIOUS. AND I HAD MY TROUSERS OFF FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES DRYING THEM. AND, LOOK, JUST IN 10 MINUTES OF THIS -- ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE, ALL THE WAY DOWN MY LEG, THE SAME ON BOTH SIDES. OUT HERE, YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP DRINKING, BUT THIS SWAMP IS FULL OF ROTTING LEAVES, SO YOU'VE GOT TO FILTER THE WATER FIRST. THERE'S SO MUCH JUST RUBBISH FLOATING AROUND IN THIS, ALL THE MUCK AND ALL THE DIRT. AND IF I JUST... GET IT LIKE THIS... MAKE IT INTO LIKE A SACK... ...AND SEE, THIS WATER'S NOW COMING OUT ALL NICE AND CLEAR, AND ALL THE RESIDUE AND THE DEBRIS FROM THE SWAMP SHOULD BE ALL STILL TRAPPED IN HERE. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH THERE IS, THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO KEEP OUT OF MY WATER BOTTLE. THE WATER NOW LOOKS CLEAR, BUT IT STILL CONTAINS PARASITES AND BACTERIA, SO ALWAYS BOIL IT. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE WEST, AND THERE'S A LOCAL TECHNIQUE TO HELP ME FIND MY BEARINGS. THE SECRET LIES IN THE WATER. BASICALLY, THE EVERGLADES, IT'S ABOUT A 50-MILE-WIDE RIVER THAT RUNS FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH. BUT IT RUNS REALLY SLOWLY, MAYBE LIKE 100 FOOT A DAY. SO A GOOD WAY OF WORKING OUT DIRECTION IS JUST TIE THIS WATER BOTTLE TO THE STICK. AND WHILE I'M WAITING FOR THE WATER TO BOIL, I CAN SEE WHICH WAY THIS SWINGS 'ROUND. THAT WILL GIVE ME A SOUTH DIRECTION, AND THEREFORE I CAN WORK OUT WHICH WAY I'VE GOT TO GO, WHICH WOULD BE WEST. THE WATER FLOWS SOUTH TO THE GULF OF MEXICO. AFTER 30 MINUTES, IT'S MOVED TWO FEET, AND THAT'S ENOUGH TO SHOW ME MY WAY. THIS WATER BOTTLE HAS SWUNG 'ROUND, AND IT'S STAYED PRETTY LEVEL IN ABOUT THIS POSITION, WHICH MEANS SOUTH IS THAT WAY, AND THE DIRECTION I WANT TO GO IS WEST, THAT WAY. WALKING THROUGH THE SWAMP USES UP A LOT OF ENERGY, AND YOU'D NEED TO EAT SOMETHING, BUT THERE IS LITTLE FOOD OUT HERE. BUT DEADWOOD IS OFTEN HOME TO BUGS AND INSECTS. AND THERE'S PLENTY OF THAT. THIS SHOULD BE QUITE A GOOD PLACE TO TRY AND FIND SOMETHING. AND LOOK AT THAT. JUST BREAK THAT OFF, AND INSTANTLY LOADS OF THESE CARPENTER ANTS COMING OUT. AND IF I GRAB AN END OF THIS AND JUST TIP IT OUT, YOU'LL SEE THE CARPENTER-ANT LARVAE. INSECT GRUBS ARE FOUR TIMES HIGHER IN PROTEIN THAN BEEF. THEY TASTE SOUR AND ARE SLIGHTLY GRITTY. THEY TAKE SOME GETTING USED TO, BUT BEING EASY TO FIND, THEY'RE A LIFESAVER. UGH! [ SPITS ] OH. THE SWAMP IS CHANGING NOW. EVERYWHERE, THERE ARE SMALL ROOTS STICKING UP OUT OF THE WATER. IT WOULD BE EASY TO TRIP OVER AND SPIKE YOURSELF ON ONE OF THESE. BUT AT LEAST THE WATER IS GRADUALLY GETTING SHALLOWER. BEYOND THESE TREES, I CAN SEE SOME DISTANT ONES, AND THEY LOOK LIKE MORE CYPRESS, BUT A LITTLE BIT LOWER DOWN, IT LOOKS GREENER. AND THOSE ARE PROBABLY PINE TREES AND POSSIBLY SOME OAK, AS WELL. BUT THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR ME. THOSE TREES NEED DRY GROUND TO GROW IN, SO THAT'S WHERE I'M HEADING. BUT THE BAD NEWS IS THE TALL VEGETATION AHEAD OF ME. IT'S SAW GRASS. ALL OF THIS SAW GRASS 'ROUND HERE IS JUST RAZOR-SHARP, AND IT'S VICIOUS STUFF. BUT THE KEY TO GETTING THROUGH IT IS TO KNOW WHICH WAY IT CUTS. AND THE SECRET OF IT IS THIS -- IS IF YOU PULL UP IT LIKE THIS, IT'S ABSOLUTELY FINE. BUT AS SOON AS YOU START DOING IT THE OTHER WAY... LOOK, YOU'LL SEE. LOOK AT THAT -- JUST CUTS YOU STRAIGHTAWAY, AND THAT'S 'CAUSE THE TINY, LITTLE FILAMENTS LIKE LITTLE SAW EDGES ON THE BACK OF THE GRASS. BUT HOW YOU WANT TO WALK THROUGH THIS IS JUST TO REALLY PROTECT YOUR FACE. KEEP YOUR ARMS UP LIKE THIS, AND ROLL YOUR SLEEVES DOWN. AND IF YOU'VE GOT A STICK, USE IT LIKE THIS IN FRONT OF YOU. AND AS YOU WALK, IT WILL LAY THE SAW GRASS FLAT IN FRONT OF YOU. SO HERE GOES. SAW GRASS HOLDS IN THE HUMIDITY, SO IT CAN FEEL 20 DEGREES HOTTER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS. AND WITH TEMPERATURES REACHING 90 DEGREES IN THE EVERGLADES, GETTING LOST IN THIS GRASS CAN BE FATAL. THERE WAS A GUY JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO WHO WAS OUT IN HIS AIRBOAT WHEN IT RAN AGROUND, AND HE WENT OFF LOOKING FOR HELP THROUGH ALL OF THIS SAW GRASS. BUT HE GOT LOST, GOT HEATSTROKE, DISORIENTATED, AND WITHIN 24 HOURS, HE WAS DEAD. AND WHEN THEY FOUND HIS BODY, HE WAS JUST A QUARTER OF A MILE FROM A ROAD. AND THAT'S HOW EASY IT IS TO GET LOST IN HERE. AAH. WELL, HERE'S A RIVER. NORMALLY, THAT WOULD BE GOOD NEWS. YOU'D FOLLOW IT DOWNSTREAM TO CIVILIZATION. BUT IN THIS CASE, I WANT TO STICK TO MY PLAN OF HEADING WEST AND TO DRY GROUND AND TOWARDS THOSE TREES. THE PROBLEM IS THIS RIVER IS DEEP AND IT'S GONNA HAVE ALLIGATORS IN IT. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE ANY CLOSER THAN THIS. THEY ARE SO TERRITORIAL. I'M HEADING WEST IN THE EVERGLADE SWAMPS, AND DRY GROUND IS FINALLY AHEAD. BUT THERE'S A PROBLEM. A BIG RIVER BLOCKS MY PATH, AND THAT MEANS ALLIGATORS. AND THIS IS AS CLOSE AS YOU WANT TO GET TO ONE OF THESE GUYS. THEY ARE SO TERRITORIAL. NO CLOSER, REALLY, THAN 15 FOOT -- IN FACT, WE'RE PROBABLY TOO CLOSE HERE, SO LET'S BACK UP SLOWLY. OKAY, WE NEED TO COME 'ROUND. ALLIGATORS CAN RUN AT 30 MILES AN HOUR OVER A SHORT DISTANCE. THAT'S FASTER THAN ME. IF IT HISSES, MOVE BACK EVEN FURTHER. IT CAN MEAN IT'S ABOUT TO ATTACK. BUT WHERE YOU FIND ONE ALLIGATOR, THERE WILL OFTEN BE OTHERS. TO KEEP GOING WEST, YOU'D HAVE TO FIND THE SAFEST PLACE TO SWIM THIS RIVER. THIS IS GONNA BE A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO TRY AND CROSS. IT'S ABOUT AS NARROW AS THIS RIVER'S GONNA GET. BUT ALSO I'VE GOT GOOD VISIBILITY ALL THE WAY 'ROUND. THE BEST THING TO DO IS STAY AND WATCH FOR A WHILE. ALLIGATORS CAN STAY UNDERWATER, THE BIG BOYS, FOR UP TO 45 MINUTES. SO I'M JUST LOOKING OUT FOR ANY RIPPLES OR WHEN THEIR EYES AND THEIR HEADS SURFACE. WHEN IT GETS HOT, ALLIGATORS USE DEEPER WATER TO COOL DOWN. THEY LIE MOTIONLESS ON THE RIVERBED AND WAIT. CROSSING RIVERS WHERE THERE ARE ALLIGATORS IS DANGEROUS AND MUST ONLY BE A LAST RESORT, AND NEVER DO IT DURING THE MATING SEASON, WHEN THE MALES ARE MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE. IN 2006, THREE WOMEN WERE KILLED IN ONE WEEK. ONE WAS SWIMMING. THE OTHER TWO WERE DRAGGED IN FROM THE WATER'S EDGE. YOU SHOULD DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MINIMIZE THE RISK. IT IS MIDDAY, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE NOT FEEDING. YOU SHOULD FIND THE NARROWEST BIT OF THE RIVER AND KEEP A REALLY GOOD EYE OUT FOR ANY SIGNS OF MOVEMENT. WAIT FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR, BUT REMEMBER, ALLIGATORS ARE INQUISITIVE AND ARE ATTRACTED TO ACTIVITY, SO YOU NEED TO BE IN AND OUT OF THE WATER FAST. LOCAL RANGERS HAVE HELPED MAKE THIS AS SAFE AS WE CAN, BUT STILL, THIS IS DANGEROUS. OFTEN ALLIGATOR ATTACKS ARE MISTAKEN IDENTITIES. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY THINK YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE. AND THE DANGER OF SWIMMING ON THE SURFACE WITH YOUR HEAD BOBBING AROUND IS THEY CAN OFTEN THINK YOU'RE LIKE A BIRD OR A TURTLE. SO WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS SWIM UNDER THE WATER AND AS FAST AND SMOOTHLY AS YOU CAN. IT'S ALMOST ZERO VISIBILITY DOWN HERE, AND IT'S DISORIENTATING. THERE ARE OVER 4,000 SQUARE MILES OF SWAMP AND MARSH IN THE EVERGLADES, AND BEING WET SAPS NOT ONLY YOUR ENERGY, IT CAN ALSO REALLY GET YOU DOWN. AS A KID, I GREW UP ON THE WATER, AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN QUITE A WATER BABY, BUT I TELL YOU, OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS, I HAVE OFFICIALLY HAD IT WITH WATER. WELL, I'M ON DRY LAND NOW, AND THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN TRAIPSING THROUGH THE SWAMP. BUT DRY LAND HAS A WHOLE NEW SET OF CHALLENGES OUT HERE. I'VE NOW FINISHED WITH THE SWAMP, AND I'M ON TO DRY LAND, BUT HERE THERE ARE NEW HAZARDS, LIKE SNAKES AND BLACK BEARS. BUT FINDING FOOD WILL ALWAYS BE A PRIORITY. AAH! LOOK AT THIS -- A LITTLE TREE FROG AND JUST SCURRYING AROUND IN THE GRASS THERE. AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY EAT THESE. ANY OF THESE FROGS IN THE EVERGLADES ARE FINE TO EAT. THERE ARE NO POISONOUS ONES. YOU GET POISONOUS TOADS, BUT THEY'RE MUCH BIGGER AND ROUGHER. AND, AS THEY SAY, ANY FROG IN THE EVERGLADES IS A GOOD FROG. IT'S TOO SMALL TO COOK, AND THE FIRST BITE MUST KILL IT. OTHERWISE, IT WOULD WRIGGLE ALL THE WAY DOWN. UGH. [ SPITS ] BIT MORE CALORIES, AT LEAST. UGH. OKAY, LET'S KEEP GOING. THERE'S A PRETTY CLEAR GAME TRAIL HERE, AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE GRASS ENDS, IT'S BACK TO THE BARE SOIL, RUNNING OFF INTO THE GRASS. BUT WHERE THERE'S ANIMAL TRACKS, IT WILL OFTEN LEAD TO FOOD. SO I'M JUST GONNA FOLLOW THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT, SEE WHERE IT GOES. ANIMAL TRACKS ARE ALWAYS WORTH FOLLOWING FOR A LITTLE WHILE, AS THEY CAN OFTEN LEAD YOU TO WATER AND TO FOOD. BUT DON'T FOLLOW THEM FOR TOO LONG, AS THEY CAN ALSO LEAD YOU OFF COURSE. WOW, GRAPEFRUITS. YEAH, LOOK, SEE UP THERE? I TELL YOU, FINDING THESE OUT HERE IS REALLY, REALLY UNUSUAL. THESE ARE NOT NATIVE TO THE REGION. AND COMING ACROSS CITRUS FRUIT IN THE EVERGLADES ONLY MEANS ONE THING -- THAT THIS AREA HERE WAS PROBABLY USED AS AN OLD SEMINOLE CAMP. THE SEMINOLE TRIBE MOVED HERE DURING THE FLORIDA WARS IN 1817. THE SWAMP WAS A REFUGE AGAINST THE U.S. ARMY. AND THERE'S AN ORANGE TREE, AS WELL, HERE. YEAH, A LITTLE UNRIPE ORANGE, BUT THIS TELLS ME THIS WAS DEFINITELY AN OLD SEMINOLE CAMP HERE. AND THE SPANISH BROUGHT THESE ORANGES OVER TO TRADE, AND THE SEMINOLE TRIBE BROUGHT THEM HERE INTO THE EVERGLADES. AND... UGH, QUITE SHARP, BUT A REALLY GOOD SOURCE OF VITAMIN C. BUT THIS CAMP IS DEFINITELY NO LONGER USED, AND ALL THESE DO NOW IS PROVIDE FOOD AND ENERGY FOR ALL THE ANIMALS, ALL THE HOGS, AND THE LIKES OF ME. [ SPITS ] BIT IN MY EYE. OW. THIS WOULD BE THE PERFECT PLACE FOR YOU TO SET UP CAMP. THIS BRANCH HERE CAN MAKE A PRETTY NICE TOP BEAM, AND THEN ALL I NEED IS A COUPLE OF BITS LIKE THIS ON EITHER SIDE, AND IT WILL MAKE A NICE LITTLE A-FRAME SHELTER. LASH TWO SUPPORTS TOGETHER AT THE MOUTH OF THE SHELTER. AND ONCE AGAIN, THE CABBAGE PALM MAKES EXCELLENT CORDAGE. BUT IT HAS OTHER USES, TOO. WHAT I'M USING IS JUST THE STALKS OF THE FROND TO MAKE THE FRAME HERE. ONCE THE UPRIGHTS ARE IN PLACE, MAKE AND TIE CROSS BRACINGS TO COMPLETE THE STRUCTURE. THEN LAY THE FAN-SHAPED PALMS OVER THE TOP, AND THAT WILL KEEP THE RAINWATER OFF. MAKING FIRE IS ALWAYS IMPORTANT. IT KEEPS PREDATORS AWAY AND ALSO LIFTS MORALE. THIS IS A FOUR-POINTED FIRE, AND YOU CAN SEE THESE FOUR LOGS COMING OUT. AND THIS IS A VERY EFFICIENT FIRE. IT'S SLOW-BURNING. BUT ALSO IT'S A VERY TRADITIONAL FIRE FOR THE SEMINOLE TRIBE, AND THEY'D USE IT A LOT WHEN THEY WERE BEING HUNTED AND TRACKED BY THE U.S. ARMY. IF THEY EVER HEARD DANGER COMING, THEY COULD PULL THESE APART, AND THE FIRE WOULD DIE DOWN PRETTY QUICKLY. AND ONCE THE DANGER WAS PASSED, THEY COULD PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN AND BUILD THE FIRE UP VERY QUICKLY. LOOKING FOR FOOD IS ALWAYS A PRIORITY, AND IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, YOU CAN'T BE TOO CHOOSY, BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE TO EAT HERE THAN JUST FROGS. THIS IS A TURTLE -- ACTUALLY, A COOTER. LOOK, YOU CAN TELL THAT FROM THE SPOTS ON THE SIDE OF THE SHELL HERE. AND THESE ARE A REALLY GOOD SOURCE OF MEAT, BUT ALSO VITAMINS, MINERALS, AND SALTS THAT ARE IN THE ACTUAL BLOOD, AND YOU REALLY NEED SOME OF THESE SALTS JUST IN THIS HUMIDITY. I CAN EAT THIS TURTLE BECAUSE IT'S NOT PROTECTED. BUT YOU MUST BE SURE YOU KILL IT QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY. AND THAT'S IT -- DEAD, AS HIS ARTERY'S CUT. WHENEVER I'VE EATEN TURTLES BEFORE, I'VE ALWAYS CRACKED THE BELLY, GUTTED IT, AND THEN SCRAPED ALL THE MEAT OUT AND COOKED IT LIKE THAT. BUT IN THE EVERGLADES, WHAT THE SEMINOLES USED TO DO IS LITERALLY JUST COOK IT STRAIGHT IN ITS SHELL, SORT OF LIKE A PRESSURE COOKER. IF I JUST PUT IT ON THERE AND LEAVE THAT FOR LIKE AN HOUR, THAT WILL COOK AND THEN GIVE YOU A REALLY GOOD DINNER. COOKING TIME WILL DEPEND ON THE SIZE OF THE TURTLE. BUT ONE GOOD WAY TO TELL WHEN IT'S READY IS THAT THE SHELL IS BRITTLE AND CRACKS. AND ALL I NEED DO NOW IS GET IT OFF HERE. AND THEN YOU SEE IT'S JUST REALLY BRITTLE. GONNA TRY THIS. MMM. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE TIMES WHERE YOU CAN SAY IT REALLY DOES TASTE QUITE LIKE CHICKEN. SEE ALL OF THE GOOD, FLESHY MEAT HERE. AND THAT'S REALLY GOOD MEAT. MMM. A GOOD MEAL WILL GIVE YOU VITAL ENERGY AND ALSO GIVE YOU A PSYCHOLOGICAL BOOST, AND SO MUCH OF SURVIVAL IS ABOUT KEEPING YOUR MORALE UP. I'M GONNA CONTINUE HEADING WEST. ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BEARINGS. THIS PLACE CAN BE SO DECEPTIVE. IT FEELS SAFER THAN THE SWAMPS, BUT COMPLACENCY OUT HERE CAN BE DANGEROUS. THERE'S A SNAKE SKIN. LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS WHY YOU'VE GOT TO BE SO CAREFUL. THE EVERGLADES ARE UNIQUE. THEY'RE A MOSAIC OF DIFFERENT TERRAINS, ALL MIXED TOGETHER, EACH HOLDING ITS OWN SET OF DANGERS. I'VE JUST COME INTO THIS SMALL PATCH OF TREES. THEY'RE SUDDENLY VERY DIFFERENT FROM EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN MOVING THROUGH BEFORE, AND THESE ARE ACTUALLY CALLED MELALEUCA, OR PUNK TREES, AND THEY'RE NOT NATIVE TO THE EVERGLADES. THEY WERE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IN 100 OR SO YEARS AGO BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN THIS ATTEMPT JUST TO DRY OUT THE EVERGLADES, 'CAUSE THEY SUCK UP A HUGE AMOUNT OF WATER. JUST ONE TREE LIKE THIS SUCK UP GALLONS OF THE STUFF EVERY DAY. BUT REALLY, IT JUST DIDN'T WORK. THE SWAMPS ARE STILL SWAMPS, AND IT WAS A BATTLE THAT WAS TOO BIG FOR THESE TREES TO WIN. JUST LOOK AT THE HURRICANE DAMAGE THAT'S BEEN INFLICTED ON ALL OF THESE TREES. IT'S JUST BEEN WIPED OUT BY THE WINDS. BUT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH THESE PUNK TREES -- THEY'RE NOT NATIVE TO THE REGION, AND THEY'RE JUST NOT SUITED TO THESE SORT OF CONDITIONS. LOOK, THEY'RE MUCH MORE BRITTLE AND JUST CAN'T COPE WITH EVERGLADES-STYLE HURRICANES. JUST IMAGINE THE POWER OF THE WINDS THAT MOVED THROUGH HERE. WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF THE EVERGLADES, THEY THINK OF ALLIGATORS AND SNAKES. BUT WHAT THEY OFTEN FORGET IS ACTUALLY THERE AN AWFUL LOT OF BLACK BEARS HERE. AND LOOK, YOU CAN SEE JUST ON THIS TREE WHERE A BLACK BEAR'S COME ALONG AND JUST WHAM -- CLAWS STRAIGHT IN. SEE THESE? AND FOR ME, THAT'S JUST ONE MORE THING TO WORRY ABOUT. IN A SURVIVAL SITUATION, IT'S IMPORTANT TO EAT WHENEVER YOU CAN -- LITTLE AND OFTEN. BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY A FEW FEET DIFFERENCE IN ALTITUDE FROM WHERE I'VE BEEN IN THE SWAMPS AND HERE MEANS YOU OFTEN GET THESE NATURAL LITTLE PONDS FORMING. AND THIS ONE HERE, YOU CAN SEE, IS JUST FULL OF LITTLE MINNOWS. THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO CATCH WITH MY HANDS, BUT I DO KNOW A WAY OF GETTING AT THESE THINGS. A NET IS A SIMPLE ANSWER. USE ANY YOUNG TREE TO MAKE A FRAME. IF I JUST BEND THIS LITTLE SAPLING GENTLY 'ROUND TO HERE, AND THEN... JUST TIE THIS. OKAY, THAT'S THE FRAME FINISHED. AND THEN IF I JUST USE MY T-SHIRT... ALL I WANT TO DO... IS PLACE THIS OVER THE TOP. AND LET'S SEE WHAT WE GET. YOU'LL NEED TO BE PATIENT, AS MOVEMENT SCARES THEM OFF. YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALLY GENTLE HERE NOT TO FRIGHTEN THEM OFF SO THEY DON'T REALIZE THEY'RE BEING LIFTED OUT OF THE WATER. SOME SALTWATER FISH ARE POISONOUS, BUT FRESHWATER FISH ARE ALL EDIBLE, AND THEY'RE A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN, VITAMINS, AND FATS. THAT'S GOT A GOOD SIZE ON HIM, REALLY. GENERALLY, ANYTHING UNDER 3 INCHES IS FINE ALWAYS JUST TO EAT WHOLE. WHEN THEY'RE BIGGER THAN THAT, YOU SHOULD REALLY BE GUTTING THEM FIRST, BUT THIS IS GREAT. THEY'RE NOT MUCH OF A MEAL, BUT IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. AHEAD OF ME NOW IS MUDDY BOG. IT'S A PLACE WHERE THE EARTH WILL LITERALLY SUCK YOU IN. ALL OF THIS AROUND HERE IS WHAT'S CALLED SWAMP MUD. AND IN THE MIDDLE OF IT HERE IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS A SINKHOLE. AND THESE THINGS FORM WHEN THE WATER RUNNING UNDERGROUND ERODES THE LIMESTONE, AND THEN IT CREATES LIKE A POCKET THAT FILLS WITH MUD AND WITH WATER. AND THESE HOLES HAVE BEEN KNOWN LITERALLY TO SWALLOW ENTIRE SMALL OFF-ROAD VEHICLES. THE REASON THEY ARE SO DANGEROUS IS IF YOU GO INTO THEM, THE MORE YOU STRUGGLE, THE MORE IT SUCKS YOU INTO IT. AND, REALLY, IF YOU CAME ACROSS THIS, YOU'VE GOT TO RETRACE YOUR STEPS AND BACK OUT. BUT WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS JUMP IN AND SHOW YOU HOW TO GET OUT OF IT. UGH. AND IF I JUST TRY AND STRUGGLE A BIT, YOU'LL SEE HOW IT BEGINS TO BRING ME DOWN INTO IT. AND THIS IS WHY THESE THINGS CAN BE SO HARD TO GET OUT OF. AH. AND EACH MUSCLE I PULL CREATES SUCTION THAT PULLS ME DOWN DEEPER. AND THE TECHNIQUE FOR GETTING OUT OF THIS, THOUGH, IF YOU'VE GOT A STICK, IS TO USE THAT TO CREATE MORE SURFACE AREA TO BE ABLE TO PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON AND TRY AND WRIGGLE... YOUR CHEST ONTO IT. RECENTLY A GUY WAS OUT JOGGING IN THE EVERGLADES, AND HE RAN INTO ONE OF THESE SINKHOLES. HE WENT RIGHT UP TO HIS CHEST. HE WAS STUCK SOLID, AND FOR THREE DAYS, HE TRIED TO GET OUT, BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW HOW. HE AVOIDED DEHYDRATION BY DRINKING THE MURKY SWAMP WATER ON THE SURFACE. AND ON THE FOURTH DAY, HE WAS FOUND ALIVE, COMPLETELY DELIRIOUS AND COVERED IN BUG BITES. AND THEN ONCE YOU'RE ON THE SURFACE, JUST MONKEY-CRAWL UNTIL YOU HIT SOLID GROUND. AND THEN IT'S QUITE EASY LIKE THIS. WHEW! THAT WOULD BE A REALLY NASTY THING TO BE STUCK IN FOR FOUR DAYS. I'M JUST CAKED IN THIS STUFF NOW, HEAD TO TOE. AND IT'S MAKING WALKING HARD WORK, I'VE ALSO GOT SAND IN MY TROUSERS, WHICH IS NOT IDEAL. I CAN SEE WHY TOURISTS ARE ATTRACTED TO THIS BEAUTIFUL WILDERNESS. BUT IF YOU WERE TO GET LOST, SURVIVING HERE WOULD BE A REAL CHALLENGE. IN THE EVERGLADES, THOUGH, SALVATION CAN LIE JUST AROUND THE NEXT TREE, SO IF YOU ARE LOST, NEVER GIVE UP HOPE.
