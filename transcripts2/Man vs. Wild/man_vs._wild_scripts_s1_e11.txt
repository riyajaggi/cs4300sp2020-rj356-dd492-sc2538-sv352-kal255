 Man vs. Wild (2006–2020): Season 1, Episode 11 - Iceland - full transcript 
 While hundreds of thousands of tourists visit Iceland every year to witness freezing glaciers, steaming geothermal areas and huge black sand deserts, more than a thousand visitors find themselves requiring a rescue. Adventurer Bear Grylls demonstrates how to make a snow cave, find water in deep tunnels and avoid frostbite in this Arctic environment. Because finding food is a problem in this climate, Bear is forced to eat a sheep's eyeball and catch a ptarmigan (a wild bird). He also has to deal with blizzards and 50 mph winds as he attempts to reach safety.

 I'M BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES. I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN ICELAND, A LAND OF HUGE GLACIERS AND VOLCANOES. IT'S REALLY BLOWING HERE! EVERY YEAR, A THOUSAND TOURISTS NEED TO BE RESCUED. I'M GONNA SHOW THE SKILLS NEEDED TO SURVIVE HERE. I'M FLYING OUT OF ICELAND'S CAPITAL, REYKJAVíK... ON THE SOUTHWEST COAST, WHERE MOST OF THE 300,000 PEOPLE LIVE.

 THE ISLAND LIES JUST ON THE ARCTIC CIRCLE, IN BETWEEN THE U.S. AND EUROPE. IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF KENTUCKY BUT ONLY HAS ONE MAIN ROAD THAT FOLLOWS THE COAST ALL AROUND THE ISLAND. MOST OF THE COUNTRY IS JUST A BARREN, FROZEN WASTELAND. THIS PLACE HAS A STRANGE BEAUTY ABOUT IT, BUT IT'S ALSO UNFORGIVING DOWN THERE. ICELAND'S ORIGINAL SETTLERS WERE THE VIKINGS, WHO CAME FROM NORWAY OVER A THOUSAND YEARS AGO. THEY KNEW HOW TO SURVIVE THESE HARSH CLIMATES. PEOPLE COME HERE TO EXPERIENCE A UNIQUE GEOLOGY. IT'S CALLED THE LAND OF FIRE AND ICE. FIRE BECAUSE ONE OF THE MOST VOLCANIC COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD,

 AND ICE BECAUSE OVER 2,000 SQUARE MILES OF IT ARE GLACIERS. ON AVERAGE, THREE PEOPLE A DAY ARE RESCUED FROM THE FREEZING GLACIERS AND HUGE VOLCANIC PLAINS. THE GLACIER IS DIRECTLY UNDER ME, AND THOSE PLACES ARE ONE OF THE TOUGHEST PLACES TO SURVIVE. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW YOU CAN SURVIVE IN THIS INHOSPITABLE WILDERNESS. I'LL BE GETTING SOME ASSISTANCE FROM LOCAL EXPERTS IF NEEDED, AND A CAMERA CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. AT 4,000 FEET, I'M ON A GLACIER ON ONE OF ICELAND'S HIGHEST AND COLDEST POINTS. MAN, THIS PLACE IS BLEAK. I'M HERE IN THE MIDDLE OF WINTER. JUST NOW, IT'S 15 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, BUT IN A FEW HOURS, IT CAN GET DOWN TO A DEADLY MINUS 10. GET SOME FEELING BACK IN MY HANDS AGAIN. MY GOAL IS TO SHOW HOW YOU COULD SURVIVE IN THIS WASTELAND IF YOU JUST KNOW HOW. ONE OF THE SIMPLEST WAYS OF FINDING OUT NORTH OR SOUTH WHEN YOU'RE IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE IS JUST TO USE YOUR WATCH AND THE SUN. AND ALL I NEED TO DO IS POINT THE HOUR HAND AT THE SUN. SO IF IT'S 3:00 NOW, I POINT THAT AT THE SUN, AND THEN HALFWAY BETWEEN THERE AND 12:00 IS SOUTH. AS ICELAND IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC, ITS WEATHER CAN CHANGE SO QUICKLY, AND STORMS CAN ROLL IN LITERALLY IN MINUTES. WHEN I LANDED, IT WAS SUNNY, BUT NOW I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A FULL-BLOWN BLIZZARD. ONE OF THE BIGGEST DANGERS UP HERE ON THESE GLACIERS IN CONDITIONS LIKE THIS IS HYPOTHERMIA. AND IT CAN SET IN VERY QUICKLY. JUST A DROP OF A COUPLE OF DEGREES IN YOUR CORE BODY TEMPERATURE WILL BRING IT ON. AND YOU START SHIVERING, YOU START TO SLUR YOUR WORDS, LOSE YOUR ABILITY TO THINK STRAIGHT. AND I'VE HAD IT BEFORE, AND IT'S VERY FRIGHTENING. WITHOUT SHELTER, YOU'D ONLY SURVIVE A MATTER OF HOURS IN BLIZZARD CONDITIONS. BUT AS QUICKLY AS IT CAME, THE STORM LIFTS, AND IT GIVES ME A BRIEF CHANCE TO GET MY BEARINGS. WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE IS AN ICE CAVE, AND CAVES CAN GIVE YOU PROTECTION. THE PROBLEM IS THIS CORNICE ALL THE WAY UP HERE AND HOW I'M GONNA GET OVER THIS LIP AND DOWN TO THERE. IT'S A 60-FOOT DROP TO THE BOTTOM, AND THE OVERHANGING LEDGES CAN COLLAPSE EASILY. PROBABLY MY BEST WAY OF DOING THIS IS JUST TO TRAVERSE ALONG THIS SNOW BANK. AND I NEED TO BE CAREFUL. AS YOU SEE DOWN THERE, IT LOOKS LIKE A LIP. IT MIGHT WELL BE A CLIFF DROPPING STRAIGHT OFF THAT. YOU GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL DOING THIS WITHOUT CRAMPONS AND WITHOUT AN ICE AX OR ROPE. IT JUST MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CERTAIN OF EVERY FOOTHOLD THAT YOU TAKE. OKAY. START INCHING ACROSS. WHEW! THE TEAM IS STANDING BY IN CASE I SLIP, BUT EVEN SO, I'VE GOT TO BE SO CAREFUL HERE. OKAY, I'M OUT OF THE NASTY BIT OF THIS NOW. IT'S JUST THE LAST LITTLE CHUTE DOWN INTO THE CAVE. I LOVE THESE BITS. THIS ISN'T A CAVE. IT'S ACTUALLY A FUNNEL. IT'S OPEN IN THE BOTTOM. BUT THESE -- THESE THINGS ARE FULL. WHAT HAPPENS -- MOUNTAIN WATER COMES DOWN THE GLACIER, AND BECAUSE THE WATER IS WARMER THAN THE ICE, IT CREATES THESE, LIKE, TUNNELS RUNNING UNDER THE GLACIER. WHEN THEY GET BIGGER, THEY GROW INTO THIS SORT OF THING. YOU DON'T WANT TO HANG AROUND -- HANG AROUND IN THIS. SEE A LOT OF THAT? IT'S BLUE ICE, AS WELL. THAT'S THE OLDEST SORT OF ICE AND ALSO THE MOST DANGEROUS. IT'S MOST LIKELY TO CRACK. BLUE ICE IS AS HARD AS STEEL, BUT IT'S ALSO AS BRITTLE AS GLASS. AND BECAUSE THE GLACIER'S CONSTANTLY MOVING, COLLAPSES ARE COMMON. IF YOU FOLLOW THIS UP, YOU CAN SEE A BIT OF IT WHERE IT'S FLAKED OFF. AND YOU IMAGINE WHAT THAT'S GONNA DO IF THAT DROPPED ON TOP OF YOU. LAST YEAR, A CLIMBER WAS IN AN ICE CAVE JUST LIKE THIS, AND A 150-TON SLAB SHEARED OFF. HE STOOD NO CHANCE OF SURVIVING. I WAS HOPING THIS WAS GONNA BE A GOOD PLACE TO SHELTER, BUT IT'S JUST GONNA ACT LIKE A WIND FUNNEL. I NEED TO THINK AGAIN AND GET OUT OF HERE PRETTY FAST. AS IT GROWS DARKER, A STORM ONCE AGAIN IS MOVING IN. I'VE GOT MINUTES BEFORE IT'S GOING TO HIT ME. LET'S KEEP MOVING. I'VE GOT TO GET OFF THIS THING. ALREADY TEMPERATURES ARE MINUS 10 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. THERE'S NO SIGN OF SHELTER, AND THIS STORM IS GETTING WORSE. THERE'S PROBABLY JUST 30 MINUTES OF DAYLIGHT LEFT. I'M ON A GLACIER IN ICELAND. A BLIZZARD HAS COME IN, AND IF YOU WERE HERE, YOU'D NEED TO FIND SHELTER FAST. IT'S MINUS 10 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, BUT WINDS OF 50 MILES AN HOUR MAKE IT MUCH COLDER. BUT THE WIND'S NOT ONLY MY ENEMY. IT CAN ALSO BE MY FRIEND. WHEN THE WIND BLOWS OVER THESE SORT OF RIDGES, IF YOU LOOK UP HERE, IT BUILDS UP A LOAD OF SNOW ON THE LEEWARD SIDE OF IT, THE SIDE OUT OF THE WIND. I CAN USE THAT SNOW TO DIG INTO AND CREATE A LITTLE SNOW CAVE. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, A SNOWMOBILER GOT SEPARATED FROM HIS FRIENDS DURING A BLIZZARD. HE MANAGED TO STAY ALIVE FOR 48 HOURS BEFORE RESCUE CAME, BECAUSE HE GOT OUT OF THE WIND BY DIGGING HIMSELF A SNOW HOLE. THIS IS DEFINITELY HARDER WORK WITHOUT ANY FORM OF SHOVEL. BUT ALL OF THE SNOW IS QUITE NICE AND LOOSE. AND THE BITS THAT ARE COMING OUT -- BLOCKS LIKE THIS -- I'M GONNA KEEP SO I CAN USE THOSE TO THEN DAM UP THE ENTRANCE IN THE END. YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR PACE STEADY. IF YOU ALLOW SWEAT TO FREEZE ON YOUR BODY, HYPOTHERMIA WILL COME ON TWICE AS FAST. A SNOW HOLE LIKE THIS WOULD KEEP YOU OUT OF THE WIND. THE NEXT THING I NEED TO DO IS DIG A LITTLE BIT OF A PIT DOWN. THE REASON I DO THAT IS THAT COLD AIR SINKS, SO I DON'T WANT THIS COLD AIR AROUND ME. I WANT IT TO GO DOWN INTO WHAT THEY CALL A COLD WELL DOWN HERE. ALL I WANT TO DO NOW IS JUST BLOCK UP A BIT OF THIS ENTRANCE HERE. IT'S TEMPTING TO SEAL THE ENTRANCE COMPLETELY TO KEEP THE WIND OUT, BUT THAT CAN BE LETHAL. WHAT I'VE DONE HERE IS JUST PUT SOME OF THE BLOCKS OVER THE TOP, AND THIS WILL CONSOLIDATE DOWN, LEFT A BIT OF A VENTILATION HOLE. I CAN PUT MY HAND OUT HERE. AND IT'S BLOWING HARD. IT'S SNOWING. THIS WILL GIVE IT A LIGHT COVERING, BUT I NEED TO MAKE SURE TO KEEP PUTTING MY HAND THROUGH TO KEEP THAT VENTILATION HOLE. OTHERWISE, YOU CAN SUFFOCATE IN THESE THINGS. STAYING HYDRATED HELPS KEEP YOUR BODY WARM. IT'S TEMPTING TO EAT THE SNOW, BUT THAT WOULD JUST COOL MY CORE BODY TEMPERATURE DOWN EVEN MORE. SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS MELT THE SNOW WITH YOUR BODY HEAT. AS SOON AS YOU SEE A BREAK IN THE WEATHER, YOU NEED TO GET OFF THE GLACIER FAST. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT IN ANOTHER STORM UP HERE. IT'S DEFINITELY LESS WINDY THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY. IT'S STILL PRETTY WINDY, BUT, ACTUALLY, I SEE THE SUN OVER THERE, WHICH IS A GOOD SIGN. YOU'LL NEED TO FIND YOUR WAY, AND YOU CAN USE THE SUN. BUT IN ICELAND, THE SUN DOESN'T RISE IN THE EAST AND SET IN THE WEST. IT'S MORE LIKE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST. SO, IF THAT'S SOUTHEAST NOW AND THE SUN HAS JUST COME UP, IT MEANS SOUTHWEST IS OVER THERE. GLACIERS ARE FULL OF THESE ICE GULLIES, AND THEY CAN BE DANGEROUS. ALL OF THIS SNOW HERE, THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED ROTTEN SNOW, WHICH MEANS IT'S FALLEN, IT'S THAWED, AND THEN IT'S REFROZEN, SO YOU GET THIS CRUST, WHICH IS REALLY GOOD FOR WALKING ON. I CAN JUST DIG MY FEET IN AND GET REALLY GOOD HOLDS IN IT. BUT THE DANGER ON GLACIERS ARE CREVASSES. WHAT YOU OFTEN GET WITH CREVASSES IS A THIN COVERING OF COMPACTED SNOW. IT'S CALLED A SNOW BRIDGE. YOU CAN SEE THERE JUST WHERE ONE HAS COLLAPSED. AND THIS IS WHY THEY'RE SO DANGEROUS. YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU'RE ON ONE, AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UNDER YOU, AS WELL. THESE COULD BE SOMETIMES HUNDREDS OF FEET DEEP, JUST NARROW CHASMS UNDERNEATH YOU. I'VE JUST GOT TO BE ULTRA CAREFUL TO STICK TO THE SIDE OF THESE GULLIES. IF YOU FALL INTO A CREVASSE, THEY CAN BE IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OUT OF. AND WITH NO CHANCE OF ESCAPE, A SLOW DEATH IS ALL THAT AWAITS YOU. AND THIS REALLY IS THE VERY END OF THE GLACIER. YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF GLACIERS AS LIKE LIVING BEASTS, YOU KNOW? THEY MOVE. THEY SHIFT. THEY GROAN. AND OFTEN, THEY'RE ANGRY. I'M NOW AT 3,000 FOOT, AND THE TEMPERATURE IS JUST ABOVE FREEZING. EVEN WHEN YOU GET OFF THE GLACIER, YOU CAN STILL COME ACROSS HAZARDS WHICH WILL BLOCK YOUR ROUTE, LIKE THIS -- A DEEP GLACIAL RIVER. ALL OF THAT WATER IS GLACIAL MELTWATER. IT'S GOT TO BE FREEZING, FREEZING COLD. YOU WANT TO DO ANYTHING YOU CAN TO AVOID BEING IN THAT, SO I NEED TO THINK OF SOME WAY OF TRYING TO GET ACROSS THIS. BUT THERE MAY BE A SOLUTION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER. I CAN SEE SOME STEAM COMING FROM SOME VENTS ON THE HILLSIDE OVER THERE. THAT MEANS GEOTHERMIC HOT POOLS, WARM WATER. THEREFORE, JUMPING INTO THIS GLACIAL WATER IS A RISK I CAN TAKE. BUT IT WOULD BE A RACE AGAINST TIME. YOU'D NEED TO GET TO THOSE HOT POOLS ON THE OTHER SIDE BEFORE THE FREEZING WATER AND COLD WIND GETS YOU FIRST. TO BE ABLE TO CLIMB DOWN THIS -- AND, REALLY, I'VE GOT NO CHOICE APART FROM JUST JUMPING IT. BUT IT'S EASILY DEEP ENOUGH. THE WATER'S CRYSTAL CLEAR. I CAN SEE ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM. BUT IT IS HIGH. THIS IS PROBABLY ABOUT A 30-FOOT JUMP. AND I JUST KNOW THAT WATER IS GLACIAL. IT'S GONNA BE FREEZING. AS SOON AS I GO INTO IT, IT'S GONNA BE A TICKING TIME BOMB BETWEEN HYPOTHERMIA AND REACHING THOSE POOLS. I'M IN ICELAND, TACKLING THE DANGERS YOU'D COME ACROSS IF YOU GOT STRANDED HERE. BUT A DEEP GLACIAL RIVER IS BLOCKING MY ROUTE. MY ONLY OPTION IS TO JUMP. OKAY. WHEW! THE FREEZING WATER HAS SENT MY BODY INTO SHOCK. I'M ALSO RAPIDLY LOSING HEAT, AND THAT'S MAKING ME WEAKER BY THE SECOND. NOW I'VE GOT TO GET TO THE HOT GEOTHERMAL POOLS TO GET MY BODY TEMPERATURE BACK TO NORMAL. AND THAT IS JUST BITING COLD. GOD! MY HANDS, MY LEGS JUST FEEL NUMB. AND I JUST KNOW I JUST GOT TO KEEP EVERY LIMB MOVING UNTIL I REACH THOSE POOLS. WHERE'S MY HOOD? THE AIR IS LITERALLY REFRIGERATING MY BODY. OKAY. IN EXTREME COLD, MY BODY ACTS TO PROTECT THE BRAIN AND HEART BY DRAINING BLOOD AWAY FROM MY HANDS AND FEET, AND THAT MAKES RUNNING EVEN HARDER. THERE'S A HOT POOL, BUT LOOK AT THIS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE -- SEE THAT? IT'S BUBBLING. THAT IS A BOILING TEMPERATURE. AND THERE'S NO WAY -- THERE'S NO WAY I'M GETTING INTO THAT. I'M FEELING MY ARMS AND LEGS BEGINNING TO SHUT DOWN. I NEED TO THINK QUICKLY NOW. YOU SEE THIS STREAM. THIS IS RUNNING OUT OF THAT HOT MUD POOL. ANYWAY... ALL I'M DOING HERE IS DAMMING UP THIS BIT OF THE STREAM AND THEN HOPEFULLY CREATE A BIT OF A POOL FOR ME TO GET IN. YEAH, THAT'S KIND OF A MANAGEABLE TEMPERATURE. I'VE GOT TO GET IN FAST, AND IF I DON'T GET THESE WET CLOTHES OFF, MY BODY WILL GO INTO SHOCK. IN THIS WIND, THEY SHOULD HOPEFULLY DRY IN MAYBE A COUPLE OF HOURS. BUT AT LEAST DURING THAT TIME -- AH -- I CAN LIE IN THIS HOT POOL AND NOT FREEZE TO DEATH. GOD. THANK GOD FOR VOLCANOES. HERE IN THE HOT WATER, YOU'D QUICKLY REGAIN YOUR BODY HEAT. NOW IT'S KIND OF ALMOST LIKE BEING AT HOME, APART FROM A BIT MUDDIER. AFTER WARMING UP AND WITH MY CLOTHES NEARLY DRY, IT'S TIME TO GET GOING. ICELAND HAS MANY GEOTHERMAL AREAS, AND OVER 90% OF HOMES ARE FUELED BY NATURALLY HEATED WATER. THIS COMES FROM UNDERGROUND RIVERS BEING HEATED BY VOLCANIC MAGMA. I NEED TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHERE I'M TREADING HERE, 'CAUSE WHAT YOU OFTEN GET ARE THESE SOFT AREAS OF MUD, WHERE ACTUALLY THE MUD IS AT BOILING POINT, REALLY FROTHING AWAY. AND EVERY YEAR, THERE WILL BE SEVERAL TOURISTS WHO WILL GET STUCK IN THIS STUFF AND GET REALLY BADLY BURNED. THE WAY JUST TO TEST THE GROUND IS JUST TO STEP REALLY GINGERLY AND JUST PUSH WITH YOUR BOOT, SEE WHERE THE MUD IS SOFT OR NOT, AND ALSO JUST TO TAP IT, AS WELL, 'CAUSE OFTEN IT WILL FEEL, LIKE, HOLLOW. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU'VE GOT THIS CRUST OVER THE TOP WITH THE MUD THEN BOILING UNDERNEATH IT. AND, SEE, EVEN HERE -- THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. THERE YOU'VE GOT A HOLE STRAIGHT DOWN. IF I TROD ON THAT, THIS WOULD PROBABLY GIVE WAY. SO WE'LL STEP OVER THIS BIT. AND THIS IS A KIND OF PRETTY NASTY AREA HERE. I'VE GOT A BOILING POOL ON BOTH SIDES. TEMPERATURES HERE ARE ABOUT 40 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, SO IT'S WARM ENOUGH FOR EDIBLE GRASSES, MOSS, AND LICHEN. SINCE VIKING TIMES, SHEEP HAVE ROAMED FREE, GRAZING HERE. AND SOME OF THESE GRASSES, LIKE THIS REINDEER MOSS, YOU COULD EAT, TOO. I CAN TELL IT'S REINDEER MOSS. LOOK, IT'S KIND OF WHITE. LOOK A LITTLE BIT LIKE LITTLE BRANCHES. ACTUALLY THEY LOOK QUITE LIKE -- QUITE LIKE REINDEER ANTLERS, AS WELL. BUT YOU CAN ACTUALLY EAT THIS. AND IT'S NOT GONNA GIVE ME MUCH NUTRITIONAL VALUE, BUT WHAT IT WILL DO IS FILL UP MY STOMACH AND STOP ME FEELING SO HUNGRY. AND THIS IS WHAT THE VIKINGS USED TO USE IT FOR. SURVIVAL IS ALL ABOUT MAKING THE MOST OF OPPORTUNITY. MOST ICELANDIC SHEEP ARE TAKEN INSIDE IN THE WINTERTIME. BUT THERE ARE ALWAYS A FEW THAT DON'T GET ROUNDED UP. A LOCAL FARMER HAS LEFT ME A DEAD SHEEP SO I COULD SHOW YOU WHAT TO DO. HE HASN'T BEEN DEAD THAT LONG. HIS EYEBALLS ARE STILL THERE, WHICH MEANS HE'S PROBABLY ONLY A FEW DAYS SINCE HE'S DIED. YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THIS. IT'S REALLY, REALLY NICE MEAT. AND NOW I'VE GOT THIS SPLIT OFF. I CAN JUST BEGIN TO CUT THE MEAT AWAY FROM ALL THE SKIN. AND NOW IT'S GONNA CUT A NICE STRIP OF THIS FAT, AS WELL. FAT SHOULD BE STORED WHENEVER POSSIBLE. THE OILS CAN BE USED IN MANY SURVIVAL SITUATIONS, LIKE EMERGENCY FOOD OR FIRE. ICELANDERS EAT ALMOST EVERY PART OF A SHEEP -- EVERYTHING FROM TESTICLES, HEART, LIVER, EVEN THE EYEBALLS. ACTUALLY, I WANT TO TAKE THIS OUT. SHEEP EYEBALLS ARE EXTREMELY NUTRITIOUS. THEY ARE HIGH IN PROTEIN AND RICH IN VITAMIN "A" AND "D." USUALLY, THEY ARE THE FIRST THINGS TO ROT. BUT IN THIS COLD WEATHER, THESE ARE STILL GOOD. THE EYEBALL -- GIVE THEM A DUNK IN THE GEOTHERMAL, COOK THE MEAT IN THERE, AS WELL, 'CAUSE IT'S BOILING. AND THEN ALL OF THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT. I COULD EAT THE MEAT RAW, BUT IT'S HARDER TO DIGEST AND CAN ACTUALLY TAKE ENERGY AWAY FROM THE BODY. SO COOK MEAT WHENEVER YOU CAN. YOU CAN SEE HERE, WHERE ALL THE WATER'S BOILING. ALL I NEED TO DO IS TAKE MY SHOELACE OFF... ...AND PUT A LITTLE LOOP IN THE END HERE... LIKE THAT. AND IF I GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THESE BITS OF MEAT... ...I CAN THEN THREAD THIS THROUGH. AND THEN JUST THIS LAST BIT. WHAT I'M GONNA DO, LOOP IT THROUGH ITSELF... AND THAT, THEN, IS READY TO GO INTO THE BOILING WATER. LOOK. INSTANTLY, YOU CAN SEE IT TURNING BROWN THERE. THAT'S HOW HOT THIS WATER IS. AND WHILE THE MEAT'S COOKING AT ONE END OF THE SHOELACE, I CAN TAKE THE OTHER END OF IT AND JUST THREAD IT THROUGH THIS EYEBALL. THESE ARE REALLY OKAY TO EAT RAW. I'M JUST GONNA DIP IT IN HERE JUST TO GET ANY SORT OF BACTERIA OFF IT. GIVE IT A QUICK BLAST IN THE BOILING WATER, AND THEN... ...THIS EYEBALL IS GONNA BE OKAY TO EAT. GOD, IT'S LIKE CHEWING GRISTLE FULL OF COLD GLOOP. UGH! 10 MINUTES OF COOKING TIME, AND MY MAIN COURSE SHOULD BE DONE. LET'S SEE -- SEE IF THIS IS READY. OH. THAT IS LIKE JUST THE BEST LAMB YOU GET IN A RESTAURANT -- COOKED IN VOLCANIC, BOILING WATER. ALREADY I CAN FEEL THE WIND CHANGING. AND THE ICELANDERS HAVE A SAYING -- IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE WEATHER, JUST WAIT FIVE MINUTES, AND IT WILL GET A LOT, LOT WORSE. I'M IN THE WILDERNESS IN ICELAND. HERE, THERE ARE HUGE FREEZING RIVERS LIKE THIS. AND ANOTHER STORM WITH 50-MILE-AN-HOUR ARCTIC WINDS HAS WHIPPED UP, AND THE TEMPERATURE HAS PLUMMETED TO MINUS 15 DEGREES. IT'S REALLY BLOWING HERE, BUT I'VE GOT TO GET ACROSS THIS RIVER SOMEHOW. AND THIS ISN'T THE NARROWEST PART, BUT IT IS THE SHALLOWEST BIT OF THE RIVER. AND I CAN USE THIS TO MY ADVANTAGE. AND YOU CAN SEE THE ROCKS IN IT CREATING LIKE THESE EDDIES OF SLACK WATER BEHIND THEM. I CAN USE THAT TO GO FROM ONE TO THE NEXT AND THEN OUT. BUT THIS WATER IS GOING TO BE FREEZING COLD, ESPECIALLY THE WINDCHILL FACTOR. SO I'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE MY CLOTHES, ESPECIALLY MY TOP HALF, STAY DRY. SOAKING-WET CLOTHES IN THESE CONDITIONS ARE LETHAL. SO I'M KEEPING MY CLOTHES DRY BY WRAPPING THEM IN MY WATERPROOF JACKET. I'M FACING UPSTREAM INTO THE WATER. IT'S EASIER TO KEEP MY BALANCE. I CAN'T AFFORD TO SLIP HERE. WELL, I'M ACROSS, AND ALL OF THESE CLOTHES HAVE ACTUALLY STAYED AMAZINGLY DRY IN THERE. AND THEN WHAT THEY USED TO SAY IN THE ARMY -- IF WE EVER COMPLAINED OF BEING COLD, THEY'D MAKE US DO 5 OF THESE... AND 10 OF THESE... AND YOU'RE WARM AGAIN. THE STORM HAS BLOWN OVER, AND I'VE SPOTTED A FOREST IN THE DISTANCE. IN ICELAND, THE POOR SOIL, WIND, AND TEMPERATURE MEANS THAT TREES ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. BUT WHEN YOU DO FIND THEM, THEY'RE IDEAL FOR BOTH SHELTER AND WILDLIFE. HEY. THIS IS PTARMIGAN FEATHERS HERE. SEE THIS? ALL OF THIS. AND PTARMIGAN'S LIKE A TYPE OF GROUSE, BUT THIS IS WHY THEY HAVE THIS WHITE WINTER PLUMAGE. WHAT IT DOES -- IT CAMOUFLAGES THEM WELL WITH THE SNOW. THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR ME IF THERE ARE PTARMIGANS AROUND. I MIGHT WELL BE ABLE TO GET ONE. PTARMIGAN ARE KNOWN AS SNOW CHICKENS IN THE U.S. BECAUSE OF THEIR WINTER PLUMAGE. AND THEY FEED ON BERRIES AND SEEDS BENEATH THE TREES. THIS IS -- THIS IS KIND OF WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR HERE. LOOK, A BIT OF A NATURAL -- A NATURAL CHANNEL WHERE PTARMIGANS MIGHT WELL PASS. SO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS USE YOUR SHOELACES. JUST TIE THIS END IN A REALLY SIMPLE LITTLE OVERHAND KNOT THAT GIVES ME A LITTLE LOOP, AND THEN TIE THIS END AROUND THE TREE. AND THEN JUST SET THIS ONE IN THAT SIDE... ...AND DRAPE THAT OVER HERE. AND THE IDEA IS, PTARMIGAN COMES ALONG, GOES THROUGH THIS. THEY'LL GET SNARED IN THAT AND STUCK TO THE TREE. I'M GONNA SET SEVERAL TRAPS AND HOPE THAT ONE WILL PAY OFF BY MORNING. YOUR NEXT PRIORITY WILL BE TO FIND SHELTER AND BUILD A FIRE. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A TRADITIONAL SHELTER LIKE THE ONES USED BY THE VIKINGS. WHAT I'M DOING HERE IS JUST MAKING A NICE, SPRINGY MATTRESS. THEN I'LL BUILD UP THE WALLS WITH ROCKS IN THE SHAPE OF A COFFIN TO TRAP HEAT INSIDE. THIS BIT OF THE WALL I'VE BUILT UP HIGHER SO I CAN THEN PUT SOME BRANCHES OVER THE TOP OF THIS. AND THESE DEAD BRANCHES HAVE, LIKE, A NATURAL BOW TO THEM THERE, WHICH MEANS I CAN JUST DRAPE THEM OVER THE TOP. AND THERE'S ENOUGH ROOM UNDER HERE FOR ME TO LIE. I JUST NEED TO PUT SOME MOSS ON THE TOP OF IT HERE. THIS SHOULD BE WATERPROOF. NOW I'M ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FUEL FOR A NICE WARM FIRE. THERE ARE LOADS OF THESE BIRCH TREES AROUND HERE, AND THESE ARE WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR. I CAN TELL THEY'RE BIRCH JUST 'CAUSE OF THE WAY THEY'RE SILVER-LIMBED. THIS TIME OF YEAR IN THE WINTER, ALL THE LEAVES HAVE FALLEN OFF. BUT IT'S THE LEAVES UNDERNEATH THEM THAT I'M AFTER. AND THESE ARE GONNA MAKE GOOD TINDER FOR MY FIRE. I'M GOING TO NEED LOADS OF WOOD TO KEEP ME WARM. I'M JUST BUILDING UP LIKE A WALL OF ROCKS AROUND IT, AS WELL, JUST TO PROTECT IT, AND THEN KEEP BUILDING IT UP. I CAN JUST FEEL REALLY NICE WARMTH IN MY HANDS. IT'S NICE. SO FAR, I'VE SHOWN YOU HOW TO COPE WITH EVERYTHING ICELAND MIGHT THROW AT YOU... BUT ITS DEADLY LAVA TUNNELS MIGHT BE ONE THING TOO MANY. THIS HAS JUST GOT AN AWFUL LOT HARDER. LAST NIGHT, I LAY TRAPS FOR PTARMIGAN, A TYPE OF GROUSE FOUND IN ICELAND, AND I'M HOPING I GET LUCKY. SO, I WANT TO BUILD THIS UP AND THEN GO AND CHECK MY TRAPS. NO. NOTHING. NOTHING IN THIS. YOU KNOW, IT'S NO GREAT SURPRISE. MY PAST EXPERIENCE SAYS, REALISTICALLY, TO GET THINGS IN SNARES, I NEED TO SET A REALLY GOOD NUMBER OF THESE. BUT SO MUCH OF SURVIVAL IS JUST ABOUT KEEP TRYING AND HAVING THE ENERGY TO MAKE THESE SORT OF THINGS EVEN WHEN YOU'RE TIRED AND YOU DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE IT. IF YOU'D MANAGED TO TRAP A PTARMIGAN, THIS IS WHAT YOU'D DO WITH IT. I DON'T NEED TO PLUCK THIS. THERE'S A FASTER WAY. I JUST CUT THE HEAD AND WINGS OFF AND PEEL THE SKIN AT THE BREAST BACK. ALL THE SKIN WILL COME OFF. AND THEN JUST GET MY HANDS IN AND PULL ALL OF ITS GUTS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE BACK... AND PEEL ALL OF THIS BACK. I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT THIS. THE PTARMIGAN IS A POPULAR CHRISTMAS DISH IN ICELAND, BUT I'M NOT WAITING THAT LONG. THIS ONE'S GONNA BE READY IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES. MMM. LOOK AT THAT -- ALL THAT DARK MEAT. QUITE STRONG. HERE'S AN ANGELICA PLANT. THERE ARE VERY SPECIAL PLANTS IN ICELAND. THEY ACTUALLY GROW WILD ALL OVER THE PLACE. BUT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THESE IN THE SUMMERTIME. ALL OF THIS GREEN, AND THEY HAVE THESE WHITE FLOWERS ON THE TOP. NOW, OBVIOUSLY, IN THE WINTERTIME, IT'S BARE, BUT YOU CAN SEE ITS VERY DISTINCT SHAPE. BUT WHAT I'M AFTER IS THE ROOT. AND, ACTUALLY, ALL OF THESE ROOTS ARE EDIBLE FOR FOOD IF I SCRAPE AWAY A BIT OF THE SAND HERE... ...TO GET TO THE INSIDE OF THE ROOT THERE. THIS IS ALL EDIBLE, AND, ACTUALLY, IT'S GONNA MAKE MY MOUTH ALSO A LITTLE BIT NUMB BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY A LOCAL ANESTHETIC, AS WELL. BUT IT'S GOOD FOR ME. IT'S GONNA BOOST MY IMMUNE SYSTEM, THIS STUFF. AND, ACTUALLY, IT'S ALSO ANTIBACTERIAL, SO WHAT I CAN ALSO DO IS TAKE A BIT OF IT... ...TAKE A BIT OF IT AND, LIKE, CLEAN MY TEETH WITH IT, WHICH IS ALWAYS NICE WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE WILD WITH NO TOOTHBRUSH. WHEN YOU'RE STRANDED IN THE WILD, IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO TRY AND LOOK AFTER YOURSELF. HERE IS ONE OF THE MANY ANCIENT LAVA FIELDS THAT COVERS OVER 10% OF ICELAND. THEY'RE FORMED BY VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS WHEN THE MOLTEN ROCK COOLS AND SOLIDIFIES, AND THEY CAN BE TREACHEROUS TO CROSS. SEE HERE, ALL OF THIS LAVA FIELD IS JUST COVERED IN THIS MOSS. AND IT'S JUST MAKING CROSSING IT REALLY SLOW, SLOW WORK. ALSO, I NEED TO BE CAREFUL, JUST 'CAUSE IT'S HARD TO TELL WHAT THE MOSS IS GROWING OVER, WHETHER IT'S, LIKE, A HOLLOW OR GAP OR SOLID ROCK. I MEAN, JUST TOO EASY TO TWIST AN ANKLE IN THIS STUFF. YEAH, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK. SEE, ALL OF THESE LITTLE HOLES. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. THE LAST VOLCANIC ERUPTION WAS IN 2004, BUT SOME OF THESE LAVA FIELDS ARE ANCIENT, MORE THAN 7,000 YEARS OLD, AND THEY HOLD A SPECIAL PLACE IN ICELANDIC FOLKLORE. THE IDEA OF ELVES AND TROLLS IS REALLY EMBEDDED IN ICELANDIC CULTURE. AND THEY SAY ABOUT 50% OF ICELANDERS STILL TODAY BELIEVE IN ELVES AND TROLLS, AND THEY'RE MEANT TO LIVE IN THE ROCKS. AND SOME ARE MEANT TO BE GOOD, AND SOME ARE MEANT TO BE MORE MISCHIEVOUS. I HOPE IT'S THE GOOD ONES LOOKING AFTER ME OUT HERE. THIS LAVA FIELD HERE IS JUST FULL OF THESE SORT OF CAVES, AND, ACTUALLY, WHAT THIS IS IS ACTUALLY AN OLD LAVA TUNNEL. AND THIS IS WHERE, ORIGINALLY, FLOWING MOLTEN, RED-HOT LAVA WOULD HAVE BEEN RACING THROUGH THIS. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THAT'S GONE -- IT LEAVES BEHIND THESE SORT OF TUBES. BUT HERE, OFF THE GLACIER, FRESH WATER IS SCARCE. AND, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THIS LAVA FIELD -- THE EXACT TRANSLATION INTO ICELANDIC IS LITERALLY "NO WATER." BUY MY BEST CHANCE IS TO GET IN THERE AND SEE IF I CAN FIND SOME SEEPS COMING THROUGH -- THROUGH THE WALLS -- OF FRESH WATER. FIRST OF ALL, BEFORE I EVEN THINK ABOUT GETTING IN THERE, I'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME SORT OF TORCH. YEAH, IT'S PITCH BLACK. I CAN MAKE A TORCH OUT OF SOME TWIGS AND THE FAT I SAVED FROM THE DEAD SHEEP. GET DOWN HERE, OUT OF THE WIND. CAVE WATER IS FILTERED THROUGH THE ROCK, SO IT WILL BE A LOT PURER THAN THE OUTLYING SNOW, WHICH CAN BE FULL OF BACTERIA. OKAY, NOW, WHAT I NEED IS JUST A BIT OF THE MATERIAL FROM MY T-SHIRT. I'VE GOT SOME OF THIS SHEEP'S FAT, WRAP THIS 'ROUND, LIKE SO. TAKE THIS BIT OF T-SHIRT AND THEN TIE THAT 'ROUND IT. NOW, IF I CAN JUST GET A LITTLE FIRE GOING, THAT FAT WILL BURN REALLY BRIGHT. TRY AND GET THIS GOING. OKAY. IT'S GOING. I NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL, 'CAUSE ALL OF THIS IS FRAGILE -- OW! -- AND SHARP. SO I'M GONNA NEED MY GLOVES IN HERE. ICELAND HAS, ON AVERAGE, 33 EARTHQUAKES A DAY, AND ANY ONE OF THOSE COULD COLLAPSE THIS TUBE. YOU'VE GOT TO BE QUICK. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS JUST A GOOD SOURCE OF DRIPPING WATER. THIS ROOF'S JUST GETTING LOWER AND LOWER NOW, WHICH I DON'T LIKE. ALL OF THIS PART OF THE CEILING HERE HAS JUST COLLAPSED. IT'S A BAD TIME FOR THE TORCH TO COME APART. IF THIS GOES OUT, I'M IN REAL TROUBLE. I CAN LET YOU JUST SEE -- ALL OF THIS STUFF HERE IS WHERE IT'S COLLAPSED, AND THIS IS WHY THESE PLACES ARE SO DANGEROUS. I WANT TO GET WATER AND GET OUT OF HERE AS QUICK AS I CAN. I'M IN A LAVA TUBE IN ICELAND SEARCHING FOR WATER, BUT MY TORCH IS DYING FAST. THERE'S A LITTLE SEEP OF WATER COMING THROUGH THE ROCK HERE, AND THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH TO DRINK. YEAH, THAT'S AS GOOD AS I'M GONNA GET 'ROUND HERE. AHH. IT'S NICE. I NOW HAVE A FULL WATER BOTTLE. JUST WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS LAVA TUBE BEFORE THIS FIRE DIES. DO THE REST OF THIS IN THE DARK IF THIS GOES OUT. THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANT -- LOOK, IT'S GONE. OH, NO. I'M FORCED TO DO THE LAST 200 YARDS IN DARKNESS. BUT AT LAST, I'VE MADE IT TO THE CAVE EXIT. I'M AT THE EDGE OF THE LAVA FIELDS, BUT I'LL STILL NEED ALL MY ENERGY TO CROSS THE VAST PLAINS THAT STRETCH IN FRONT OF ME. AND THEN A 50-MILE-AN-HOUR WIND CLOSES IN. AND IT'S JUST LIKE MAKING PROGRESS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. THIS IS PROBABLY GUSTING... THIS IS PROBABLY GUSTING 50, 60 MILES AN HOUR. AND WHAT IT DOES IS JUST WHIP UP -- WHIP UP THE SAND AND BLAST IT INTO YOUR FACE, ALL THE PEBBLES. AND IF I TRY TO LEAN INTO THIS WIND... ...THAT'S HOW STRONG IT IS. GET DOWN HERE. THIS IS -- THIS IS ACTUALLY A KETTLE HOLE IN THIS BLACK SAND DESERT. THIS GIVES ME A CHANCE TO GET OUT OF THE WIND. LOOK, YOU NOTICE, JUST LIKE 2 FOOT UNDER THE SURFACE, AND ALREADY I CAN HEAR MYSELF THINK AGAIN. THE WIND IS STILL SCREAMING, SCREAMING OVER MY HEAD HERE. THIS IS A BRILLIANT FIND. GIVE US A CHANCE TO MAYBE SIT HERE, WAIT A WHILE, AND SEE IF THIS WIND IS GONNA EASE UP. IT'S GOOD TO TAKE A REST. BUT STORMS HERE CAN LAST FOR WEEKS, SO IT'S BETTER TO KEEP GOING. I'M ON WHAT ICELANDERS CALL THE SANDUR. IT STRETCHES FOR OVER A HUNDRED MILES DOWN TO THE COAST AND CAN BE TREACHEROUS. ALL OF THIS AREA HERE IS JUST NOW VAST, BLACK SAND PLAIN, AND IT'S A DANGEROUS COMBINATION OF LOOSE SAND AND WATER. AND IT'S BEEN KNOWN IN THE PAST LITERALLY TO SWALLOW UP MEN AND HORSES. AND THERE IS SOMETHING EERIE ABOUT THIS PLACE. BUT THE WAY TO CROSS THIS IS JUST TO AIM ALWAYS FOR THE HIGHER GROUND. WATCH OUT FOR THE SHALLOWER DEPRESSIONS THAT ARE GONNA BE BOGGIER. AND IF YOU DO FIND YOURSELF IN THOSE, YOU GOT TO BACK AWAY AND GO 'ROUND TO THE HIGHER GROUND. OTHERWISE, YOU COULD FIND YOURSELF WAIST DEEP IN QUICKSAND. IN THE PAST, ICELANDIC SAILORS WERE UNAWARE OF THE DEADLY HAZARDS OF THE BLACK SANDS, AND MANY PERISHED WHILST COMING ASHORE. AND, REALLY, YOU KNOW, WINTER IN ICELAND -- THIS LAND OF FIRE AND ICE -- HAS JUST SHOWN ME MOTHER NATURE AT HER MOST RAW. AND IT'S BEEN EXTREME HIGH WINDS AND EXTREME LOW TEMPERATURES. AND, REALLY, IT'S PUSHED ME TO MY LIMITS.
