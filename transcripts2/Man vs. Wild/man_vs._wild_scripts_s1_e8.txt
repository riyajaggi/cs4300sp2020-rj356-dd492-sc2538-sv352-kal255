 Man vs. Wild (2006â€“2020): Season 1, Episode 8 - European Alps - full transcript 
 Every year, 120 million people ski and climb the 80,000 square miles of the Alps, Europe's greatest mountain range. Unfortunately, every year hundreds of people die enjoying this beautiful wilderness because they're unable to survive the potentially fatal conditions at heights sometimes reaching 15,000 feet. Armed with a knife, a water bottle, a cup and a flint, Bear parachutes into the Alps to demonstrate vital survival skills. From a radical new technique to save lives in crevasse zones to building a snow shelter and showing viewers how to escape from a fall into a frozen lake, Bear puts his own skills to the test in this ultimate survival challenge.

 >> MY NAME IS BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES, I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN THE FRENCH ALPS. 120 MILLION PEOPLE VISIT THESE MOUNTAINS EVERY YEAR. AND EACH YEAR, HUNDREDS OF SKIERS, CLIMBERS, AND HIKERS GET

 LOST OR INJURED. DOZENS ARE KILLED. IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, I'M GONNA SHOW THE SKILLS NEEDED TO SURVIVE. [ GRUNTING ] I'M FLYING OVER THE FRENCH ALPS. IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST TOURIST DESTINATIONS ANYWHERE FOR HIKERS, CLIMBERS, AND SKIERS. IT MAY LOOK BEAUTIFUL, BUT IT'S A PLACE WHERE EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED MOUNTAIN GOER CAN GET INTO SERIOUS TROUBLE.

 THE ALPS CAN BE A DANGEROUSLY HOSTILE WORLD. THIS YEAR ALONE, OVER 80 TOURISTS HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES IN AVALANCHES, AND EVERY SEASON, DOZENS OF CLIMBERS ARE KILLED. I'M GONNA SHOW HOW TO SURVIVE HERE. IF NEEDED, I'LL BE RECEIVING SOME HELP FROM LOCAL EXPERTS, AND A FILM CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. [ GRUNTING ] [ PANTING ] I'M GONNA SHOW HOW TO GET OFF THIS MOUNTAIN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. I'M KEEPING MY PARACHUTE, AND YOU SHOULD HOLD ON TO ANY ROPE OR CORD YOU HAVE, AS IT COULD BE USEFUL. THE CHALLENGE IS THIS GLACIER IS RIDDLED WITH CREVASSES, HUGE CRACKS IN THE ICE HIDDEN BY SNOW. THESE CAN BE UP 200 FEET DEEP. SEE THIS WALL OF ICE HERE. THIS TELLS ME THAT I'M RIGHT ON A GLACIER UP HERE. I GUESS THE HEIGHT IS MAYBE ANYTHING UP TO 10,000 FEET AND RIGHT AT THE TOP OF A GLACIER. AND THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST SLOWLY MOVING, CAUSING THESE SORT OF CREVASSES, AND ALL THESE CREVASSES ARE ARE JUST RUPTURES IN THE GLACIER WHERE IT'S SPLITTING AND CRACKING ITS WAY SLOWLY THROUGH THIS VALLEY. BUT IN SOME WAYS, I WAS PRETTY LUCKY. THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL ONE. BUT AS I GET LOWER DOWN THIS GLACIER, THEY'RE GONNA GET AN AWFUL LOT BIGGER. [ SIGHS ] A FRENCH HIKER FELL INTO A CREVASSE NEAR HERE THREE YEARS AGO. HE WAS ROPED TO HIS TWO COMPANIONS, SO HE DRAGGED THEM TO THEIR DEATHS AS WELL. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO AVOID THAT. WHAT I'VE GOT HERE ARE MY PARACHUTE RIGGING LINES, AND WHAT I'VE DONE IS ACTUALLY CUT THESE RIGGING LINES OFF THE CHUTE, AND I'M TRYING TO WEAVE A ROPE HERE. EVERY COUPLE OF FEET, I GET A BIG BUNCH OF IT, TURN IT OVER, AND MAKE A KNOT LIKE THIS. AND THE IDEA OF DOING THIS IS THIS IS A TECHNIQUE THAT ALPINE GUIDES HAVE BEEN USING RECENTLY AS A WAY OF SELF-ARRESTING YOU IF YOU TAKE A FALL. BUT THE IDEA WITH THIS -- IF I'VE GOT A LONG LINE OF KNOTTED ROPE, AS I WALK ALONG, IT CAN BOBBLE ALONG BEHIND ME. BUT IF I GO DOWN A CREVASSE, THAT FORCE WILL RIP DOWN INTO THE SNOW, AND, HOPEFULLY, THESE KNOTS WILL BITE. THE METHOD IS SIMPLE. IF HAVE YOU A BACKPACK, FILL IT WITH SNOW AND DRAG IT BEHIND YOU. IF YOU FALL, THE WEIGHT SHOULD MAKE THE KNOTS BITE INTO THE SNOW AND BREAK YOUR FALL. THIS IS DANGEROUS. SO I'M ALSO USING A BACKUP SAFETY LINE, AND YOU SHOULD ONLY DO THIS IF YOU HAVE NO OTHER OPTION. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ SCREAMS ] AND THOSE KNOTS HAVE JUST BITTEN INTO THE ICE. I CAN SEE THE FIRST KNOT JAMMING IT. GETTING OUT IS TOUGH. I'M GONNA USE A SPECIAL LOOP OF ROPE CALLED A PRUSIK. I'VE JUST GOT TO SOMEHOW GET BACK OVER THIS, BUT THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO PULL MYSELF UP THIS STRING. BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS TRY AND USE WHAT'S KNOWN AS A PRUSIK LOOP, AND I'VE GOT SOME SPARE CORDS THAT I'VE STASHED EARLIER. IF I MADE WHAT'S CALLED A PRUSIK LOOP, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRAP THIS AROUND HIGHER UP. AND IF I WRAP IT AROUND FIVE OR SIX TIMES, GET THE LOOP, AND I CAN PUT MY FOOT INTO THIS, AND THIS SHOULD BITE NOW. OKAY. AND THIS PRUSIK'S JUST GIVEN ME ENOUGH HEIGHT TO LET ME... THAT'S ALLOWED ME NOW TO REACH THIS KNOT, AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL MYSELF UP THE LAST BIT. HERE WE GO. [ GRUNTING ] [ GRUNTS LOUDLY ] [ PANTING ] THESE KNOTS HAVE REALLY HELD ME WELL. THAT'S ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS, PHYSICALLY... YOU CAN DO. TO AVOID THE GLACIERS, AIM FOR A RIDGE. FROM THERE, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE BEST WAY DOWN. IT'S LATE AFTERNOON NOW. THE SUN HAS SOFTENED THE SNOW, AND IT'S MAKING IT MUCH HARDER TO WALK. ANYONE WHO'S NOT ACCLIMATIZED SHOULD WATCH OUT FOR SIGNS OF ALTITUDE SICKNESS -- BREATHLESSNESS AND A HEADACHE. I'VE BEEN THERE, AND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S HORRIBLE. AND WADING THROUGH SNOW LIKE THIS IS PHYSICALLY EXHAUSTING, AND IT LITERALLY SAPS YOUR STRENGTH. >> I'M IN THE FRENCH ALPS, PART OF THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN RANGE IN EUROPE. I'M PUTTING MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF ONE OF THE HUNDREDS OF HIKERS, CLIMBERS, OR SKIERS THAT GET LOST HERE EVERY YEAR. BUT GETTING ANYWHERE IN THIS SNOW IS DIFFICULT, AND THIS YEAR'S RECORD-BREAKING SNOWFALL, OVER 20 FEET, IS MAKING THINGS MUCH HARDER. IT'S LIKE WADING THROUGH SUGAR. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] [ GRUNTS ] PHYSICALLY DEMANDING. THESE MOUNTAINS ARE, ESPECIALLY AT THIS ALTITUDE, AND I'M JUST NOT AS -- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AS FIT AS WHEN I WAS CLIMBING SO MUCH, AND... [ SIGHS ] I'D REALLY MURDER A CUP OF TEA. [ CHUCKLES ] BUT ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU KEEP AN EYE ON THE WEATHER. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE OVER THERE, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S SOME BAD WEATHER COMING IN, AND ONE OF THE BEST BITS OF ADVICE THAT'S EVER GIVEN BY A WEATHER EXPERT WAS THAT CLOUDS OFTEN BEHAVE LIKE THEY LOOK. IN OTHER WORDS, IF THEY LOOK MENACING, THEY'RE OFTEN ARE MENACING, AND IF THEY LOOK QUITE BENIGN, IT'S OFTEN, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT IT'S GONNA BE. BUT THAT LOOKS PRETTY NASTY. IT'S COVERING A LOT OF THOSE UPPER SUMMITS, AND IT'S HEADING THIS WAY. THE WEATHER IS CLOSING IN NOW, AND IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A SNOWSTORM ON ITS WAY. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE A SHELTER. OKAY, WHAT I'M TRY GONNA AND DO HERE IS MAKE A SNOW CAVE INTO THIS SLOPE, AND THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD PLACE TO TRY AND DO THIS. IT'S ON A LEE-FACING SLOPE, WHICH MEANS IT'S OUT OF THE WIND. IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SHELTERED, BUT ALSO IT'S MUCH EASIER DIGGING INTO A SLOPE THAN TRYING TO DIG INTO THE FLAT. MY BIG CHALLENGE IS THAT I OBVIOUSLY HAVEN'T GOT A SHOVEL, WHICH WOULD MAKE DIGGING THIS MUCH EASIER, BUT WHAT I CAN DO IS TRY AND PULL OUT FROM INSIDE THE PARACHUTE THE BACK PROTECTOR -- THAT LITTLE STRIP OF PLASTIC. HERE WE GO. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT GREAT, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY BETTER THAN NOTHING. AND THIS WILL...BE MUCH EASIER TO DIG IN THAN USING MY HANDS. WHEN THE SUN DROPS, THERE'S A REAL RISK OF HYPOTHERMIA, AND THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS TO KEEP WALKING AND SWEAT. WHEN THAT SWEAT EVAPORATES, YOUR BODY WILL COOL TO A DANGEROUSLY LOW TEMPERATURE. RIGHT NOW I'VE DUG, ACTUALLY, INTO THIS BANK A BIT. I'M NOW GONNA TRY AND CREATE, LIKE, A BIT OF A PLATFORM HERE AND GET RID OF THE SNOW, AND THIS IS GONNA BE, LIKE, A BED PLATFORM, AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS THAT THE COLD AIR WILL THEN SINK INTO WHAT I'M SITTING IN, WHICH IS LIKE A COLD WELL, AND I'LL BE ABLE TO CREATE UNDER HERE A NICE SLEEPING PLATFORM, AND THAT'S THE THEORY OF IT. BUT THEN ALWAYS SAY TRY AND MAKE A SNOW CAVE ABOUT THREE TIMES THE SIZE OF YOUR BODY, NOT TOO BIG, OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA BE WASTING ANY HEAT YOU CAN GENERATE. ANY SMALLER, AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THE SNOW COMPACTS. IT ACTUALLY SHRINKS, SO YOU'LL END UP THEN IN A MUCH WORSE SITUATION, BURIED ALIVE. SO YOU WANT ABOUT THREE TIMES YOUR OWN BODY SIZE. AND THE LAST THING I'M GONNA DO IS JUST TRY AND SMOOTH OFF THE ROOF, AND WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T DO THIS, AS YOUR BODY CREATES HEAT, THE LITTLE PINNACLES WILL START TO DRIP ON YOU, AND THE LAST THING YOU WANT WHEN YOU'RE JUST GETTING WARM IS HAVE A LEAKING ROOF. FOUR SNOW BOARDERS WERE TRAPPED ON THE MOUNTAIN NOT FAR FROM HERE IN A SNOWSTORM THREE YEARS AGO. THEY BUILT A MAKESHIFT SHELTER LIKE THIS AND SURVIVED FOR FOUR DAYS BEFORE BEING RESCUED. YOU NEED SOMETHING TO LIE ON. YOU LOSE 75% OF YOUR BODY HEAT THROUGH THE GROUND. USE ANYTHING YOU HAVE FOR THIS, A BACKPACK OR ANY SPARE CLOTHING YOU MIGHT HAVE. THE OTHER VITAL THING IS WATER. THEY SAY WITH DEHYDRATION, IF YOU'RE THIRSTY, YOU'RE ALREADY DEHYDRATED. THE DIFFICULTY IS THERE'S JUST NO RUNNING WATER UP HERE, AND THE ONLY WAY I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS IS JUST WHEN I'M WALKING ALONG, KEEP JUST STUFFING SNOW INTO MY WATER BOTTLE LIKE THIS AND THEN JUST STUFF IT UP MY JACKET, WHERE IT'S NICE AND WARM, AND LET THAT MELT BIT BY BIT. IT GIVES ME SOME FLUIDS. MY NEXT CHALLENGE IS TO TRY AND FIND FOOD IN THIS BARREN LANDSCAPE. >> I'M IN THE FRENCH ALPS PUTTING MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF A LOST CLIMBER OR SKIER. I'VE SHOWN HOW TO MAKE A SHELTER IN THE SNOW TO SEE OUT AN ALPINE STORM, AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT PROTECTION FROM THE WEATHER AND WATER TO DRINK, YOUR NEXT PRIORITY HAS TO BE FOOD. AND I TELL YOU, THIS MUST BE ONE OF THE WORST AND HARDEST PLACES IN THE WORLD TO FIND FOOD. THERE ARE NO ANIMALS THAT ARE RUNNING AROUND UP HERE. REALLY IS JUST A BARREN, BARREN, ENVIRONMENT. THE ONLY CHANCE YOU'D REALLY HAVE OF GETTING FOOD IS MAYBE TO CATCH A CROW OR ROOK, WHICH ARE SOME NATURAL SCAVENGERS, AND THEY COME UP THIS HIGH, BUT REALLY, WITHOUT ANY SORT OF BAIT, THAT'S GONNA BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND MY BEST BET IS TO HEAD DOWN OFF THIS GLACIER, GET BACK DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS WHERE THERE'S LUSH VEGETATION AND MUCH MORE FOOD. BUT HOW DO I KNOW WHICH WAY TO GO? AND A REALLY SIMPLE WAY OF WORKING OUT YOUR DIRECTION WHEN YOU'RE LOST IN THE MOUNTAINS IS JUST TO USE YOUR WATCH AND THE SUN. AND ALL I DO, IF I TAKE MY WATCH OFF... I JUST POINT THE HOUR HAND AT THE SUN, AND THEN I BISECT THE LINE BETWEEN THE HOUR HAND AND 12:00, AND THAT WILL GIVE ME A NORTH-SOUTH LINE. SO, IF I KNOW THAT'S SOUTH, I WANT TO BE HEADING OFF THE GLACIER SORT OF NORTHEAST OVER THERE. SO, THAT'S THE PLAN. THE TREE LINE IS DOWN THERE, AND IN THE FOREST, THERE'LL BE BERRIES AND ANIMALS TO EAT. THERE ARE ALSO MOUNTAIN LAKES, AND YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE TO CROSS ONE. PEOPLE DIE ON LAKES LIKE THESE EVERY YEAR. I'M GONNA SHOW HOW TO SURVIVE SUCH A LIFE-THREATENING FALL. FIRST, I'M LIGHTING A FIRE. THEN IT'S OUT ON TO THE ICE. WHENEVER I'M OUT WALKING ON A FROZEN LAKE LIKE THIS, I'M ALWAYS GOING THROUGH THE SCENARIO OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ICE GAVE WAY UNDERNEATH ME. AND IF YOU DID GO THROUGH THE ICE OF A FROZEN LAKE, THAT IS SERIOUSLY A LIFE-THREATENING HAZARD OUT HERE. AND ONLY RECENTLY, A 28-YEAR-OLD BOSTON GUY WAS SWEPT BY AN AVALANCHE INTO FREEZING WATER. HE WAS SWEPT BY THE AVALANCHE THROUGH AN 8-INCH-THICK LAYER OF ICE ON A LAKE JUST LIKE THIS. AND THE ONLY REAL WAY TO SHOW YOU THE TECHNIQUE FOR DOING THIS IS TO DO IT MYSELF...FOR REAL. AND IF YOU LOOK BEHIND ME HERE, WE'VE GOT AN AREA OF CLEAR ICE, AND I SUSPECT THIS IS GONNA BE MUCH WEAKER, AND IF I TRY AND STAND ON IT, THERE'S EVERY CHANCE I'LL GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THAT. BUT THIS IS ALWAYS THE REALLY HORRIBLE BIT, GETTING INTO A FROZEN LAKE CONSCIOUSLY. AND I KNOW THAT AS SOON AS I GET IN THAT WATER, YOUR WHOLE WORLD JUST GETS TURNED UPSIDE-DOWN. SO HERE GOES. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ COUGHS ] [ SPUTTERS ] WHOO, IT'S COLD! OKAY, THE FIRST THING I'VE GOT TO DO IS TRY AND GET SOME SEMBLANCE OF CONTROL BACK AGAIN AND FIGHT THE SENSE OF SHOCK. AND THE WAY I DO THIS IS TO TRY AND CONTROL MY BREATHING AND KEEP CALM, BUT THAT'S EASIER... EASIER SAID THAN DONE. BUT THE THREE MAIN DANGERS IN THIS WATER -- FIRST OF ALL, WHAT THEY CALL THE GASP REFLEX, WHICH IS, WHEN YOU INITIALLY GO IN, YOU JUST GASP 'CAUSE OF THE SHOCK. YOU BREATHE IN WATER INTO YOUR LUNGS, AND YOU DROWN. THE SECOND DANGER IS CARDIAC ARREST JUST FROM THE SHOCK OF THE WATER, AND THE THIRD MAIN DANGER IS THE MOST DANGEROUS. THIS IS WHAT KILLS MOST PEOPLE, AND IT'S JUST A NUMBING SENSATION. THE COLD SLOWS YOUR MOVEMENT, SAPS ALL YOUR STRENGTH, YOUR COORDINATION, AND YOU JUST DON'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CRAWL OUT AGAIN. THE FINAL THING I'VE GOT TO REMEMBER IS TO GO OUT THIS WAY, THE WAY I WENT IN, BECAUSE SURE AS HELL THE ONLY PLACE I KNOW THE ICE IS STRONG ENOUGH IS THE WAY I'VE COME FROM. HERE GOES. [ GRUNTS ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] MAKE LIKE A SEAL. KEEP A LOW CENTER OF GRAVITY NOT TO BREAK THE ICE, AND WHEN I'M A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY, GET UP. NOW YOU HAVE TO GET DRY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WHAT I CAN DO IS USE SOME OF THIS SNOW, AND EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS COMPLETELY CRAZY, IT'S A REALLY GOOD WAY JUST TO ABSORB SOME OF THE MOISTURE OFF MY BODY. AND THEN JUST TRY TO GET SOME BLOOD GOING. COME ON. I'VE GOT TO GET THIS FIRE GOING NOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS THING'S GONE OUT. COME ON. FIRE. OKAY, NOW THIS FIRE'S GOING. I'VE JUST GOT TO GET THESE CLOTHES DRY... AND THEN GET BACK ON THE MOVE AGAIN. FOR EVERY 1,000 FEET THAT I DESCEND, THE TEMPERATURE WILL RISE BY 3Â½ DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. I'M NOW AT THE TREE LINE, AND HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE MOST LIKELY TO FIND FOOD AND SHELTER. BUT THESE MOUNTAINS HAVEN'T FINISHED WITH ME BY ANY MEANS. AAH! >> I'VE PUT MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF A STRANDED HIKER IN THE FRENCH ALPS TO SHOW HOW TO SURVIVE HERE. I'M AT THE TREE LINE. NOW FOR SOME FOOD. AND HERE'S AN ANT'S NEST. WHILE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY EAT THESE ANTS WHEN THEY ARE ALIVE, 'CAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF FORMIC ACID IN THEM, IF YOU CAN GET TO THE LARVAE THAT'S OFTEN INSIDE, THOSE EGGS ARE REALLY NUTRITIOUS AND GREAT FOR BAIT. I THINK IT MIGHT BE EARLY ON IN THE SEASON TO ACTUALLY GET AT THE EGGS, BUT THERE IS A REALLY GOOD LITTLE TRICK FOR SEPARATING THE ANTS FROM THE LARVAE. WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GET, LIKE, A TARP -- I HAVEN'T GOT THAT, BUT I CAN USE MY JACKET -- CREATE A BIT OF A BOWL, MAKE A BIT OF SHADOW ON IT, AND WHEN I BREAK THIS OPEN AND HAVE A LOOK INSIDE, I CAN SEE IF THERE ARE SOME EGGS. AND, OH, GOD, LOOK. THERE'S NO EGGS, JUST A BILLION, BILLION FORMIC-ACID-FILLED ANTS, BUT NO EGGS. BUT WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE IS JUST THROW THEM ALL INTO HERE, AND THEN THE ANTS TRY AND PROTECT THE LARVAE, AND THEY PICK UP THE LEGS, THROW THEM INTO THE SHADE, AND YOU CAN LITERALLY THEN SCOOP OUT THE LARVAE AND SEPARATE THEM FROM THE ANTS AND EATEN THEM. BUT NOT THIS TIME. AND THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF SURVIVAL, IS THAT YOU WIN SOME -- GOD, IT STINKS -- YOU LOSE SOME, BUT YOU JUST GOT TO KEEP, KEEP TRYING. YOU MUST TAKE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO EAT. THESE TENDER PINE ROOTS DON'T LOOK MUCH, BUT THEY HAVE A TEXTURE LIKE CELERY AND CONTAIN VITAL CALORIES. I'VE ALSO FOUND SOME SPRING BUDS ON ANOTHER PINE TREE. THERE'S NOT MUCH ENERGY IN THESE EITHER. A HANDFUL WILL GIVE ME FEWER CALORIES THAN JUST A CORNER OF CHOCOLATE. BUT IF NOTHING ELSE, THEY GIVE ME SOMETHING TO NIBBLE ON AS I WALK. NOW A REAL CHALLENGE -- AN ENORMOUS GORGE WITH A 100-FOOT DROP. MOUNTAIN RESCUE TEAMS USE ROPE BRIDGES FOR TRAINING EXERCISES. WE'VE GOT ONE HERE SO I CAN SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE USE OF IT. YOU'LL HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER THE BRIDGE IS SAFE, AND I'M USING A SAFETY LINE BECAUSE ONE SLIP UP HERE COULD BE FATAL. THEY LOOK A BIT OLD AND TATTY, BUT THESE THINGS ARE PROBABLY PRETTY STRONG. AND WITH SOME OF MY PARA CORD LOOPED OVER THIS, AND THEN USING, JUST USING SOME PARACHUTE STUFF TO TAKE THE FRICTION ON MY HANDS, THERE'S NO REASON WHY I SHOULDN'T TRY AND SHIMMY MY WAY ACROSS THIS. AND IT SHOULD HOLD ME. OKAY. I'M GONNA USE WHAT CLIMBERS CALL A TYROLEAN TRAVERSE, WHERE YOU PULL YOURSELF ALONG, STAYING ON TOP OF THE ROPES. [ GRUNTING ] BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY. AH! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] WHOA! AHH! AT LAST, MY FEET ARE BACK ON SOLID GROUND. THESE MOUNTAINS ARE ALSO NOTORIOUS FOR THEIR AVALANCHES, WHICH WREAK HAVOC ON AN ALL-TOO-REGULAR BASIS. MOVING THROUGH THE FOREST, THEN SUDDENLY, I'M OUT INTO DAYLIGHT, AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY. THIS WHOLE AREA OF FOREST HAS JUST BEEN SMASHED BY AN AVALANCHE, AND THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST AWESOME THINGS I HAVE EVER SEEN. JUST THE POWER OF NATURE HITTING AND JUST STRIPPING ALL OF THIS BARK OFF THE TREES AND JUST SPLINTERING IT ALL. AND THE POWER OF THIS AVALANCHE WOULD JUST KILL EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH. THIS AVALANCHE PROBABLY HIT THE FOREST JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. IT WOULD HAVE MOVED UP TO 150 MILES AN HOUR. 100,000 TONS OF SNOW BREAKING TREE TRUNKS AS IF THEY WERE TWIGS. PEOPLE SKIING AND SNOWBOARDING OFF PEAKS HAVE SET OFF RECORD NUMBER OF AVALANCHES IN THE ALPS THIS YEAR. YOU CAN SEE WHAT I'M ACTUALLY WALKING ON HERE. THIS IS ALL THE PINE, AND THE EARTH IS ACTUALLY ON TOP OF THE SNOW, AND THIS STUFF HITTING WOULD JUST BE LIKE CONCRETE, SPLINTERING ALL THESE TREES. LOOK AT THIS. JUST RIPPING THEM APART. AND BASICALLY THIS IS ALL THAT'S LEFT OF AN ENTIRE PINE FOREST. AMAZING. BUT AN AVALANCHE MAY GIVE YOU THE CHANCE TO FIND SOMETHING TO EAT. IF YOU DO COME ACROSS A DEAD ANIMAL LIKE A SHAMWAR, A MOUNTAIN GOAT, MAKE SURE YOU TAKE A CLOSE LOOK. YOU CAN SEE ALL THE GUTS OF THIS HERE. THIS IS ALL ROTTING AWAY. OH, LOOK, THERE YOU GO. UNDER THIS STUFF, THERE ARE SOME MAGGOTS FEEDING OFF THIS. AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT TO GO NEAR THE FLESH OF THIS, THESE MAGGOTS ARE LIVING AND THESE ARE GOOD PROTEIN AND REALLY GOOD ENERGY, MASSIVE CALORIES. THE WAY TO EAT THESE IS YOU BITE OFF THE HEAD, 'CAUSE THAT'S THE REALLY DISGUSTING BIT. IN FACT, THE WHOLE MAGGOT IS PRETTY DISGUSTING. BUT THEN YOU JUST EAT THE BODY. BUT I WANT TO BE TAKING A BIT OF THESE NOW. A FEW FOR BAIT AND A FEW FOR FOOD. NOW I'M GOING TO USE MY MAGGOTS AS BAIT TO FIND SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL TO EAT. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHAT TO DO WITH THEM. >> I'M IN THE FRENCH ALPS. [ GRUNTING ] I'VE GOT SOME MAGGOTS, WHICH YOU CAN ALSO USE AS BAIT FOR FOOD. SO NOW A CHANCE TO USE THOSE FROZEN LAKES TO YOUR ADVANTAGE, FOR WHERE THERE'S A LAKE THERE'S OFTEN FISH. I AM DEFINITELY ON A FROZEN LAKE, AND YOU CAN JUST TELL, AS IT'S WET, REALLY SLUSHY. YOU CAN SEE, IT'S JUST A FEW DIGS DOWN, AND I'M INTO WATER HERE. AND THIS IS PROBABLY ICE. IT'S ONLY PROBABLY THREE OR FOUR INCHES THICK. AND I'VE GOT TO BE REALLY CAREFUL ON THIS STUFF. BUT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DIG A DECENT ENOUGH HOLE HERE, GET THROUGH TO THE SLUSH AND THEN THROUGH THOSE FEW INCHES OF ICE. AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS PUT OUT A NIGHT LINE WITH SOME HOOKS AND WITH A BIT OF MY PARA CORD AND TRY AND CATCH A COUPLE OF FISH. THAT'S THE PLAN. ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT A NICE-SIZED HOLE HERE, ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE WATER. AND THAT SHOULD DO. AND WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NOW IS I'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF A WEIGHT FROM JUST A ROCK, AND THEN I'VE MADE A LITTLE BIT OF THREAD OUT OF THE PARA CORD AS A LINE, AND THEN JUST PUT SOME MAKESHIFT HOOKS ALONG HERE, WHICH I MADE FROM A BIT OF THE WIRE FROM MY PARACHUTE HARNESS. AND I'M PUTTING THESE MAGGOTS ON THESE HOOKS, AND I'M HOPING THAT THESE TROUT IN HERE ARE GONNA BE PRETTY INQUISITIVE AT THE END OF A LONG WINTER. AND THE IDEA ALSO OF PUTTING HOOKS ALL THE WAY ALONG THIS LINE IS TO TRY AND GET TO FISH AT ALL DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE LAKE. BUT LIKE ALL THINGS, IT'S A BIT MAKESHIFT. BUT THE ESSENCE OF SURVIVAL IS JUST KEEP TRYING, KEEP TRYING. ANYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF THAT'S GONNA HELP YOU AND GIVE YOU FOOD. AND THE LAST THING I NEED TO DO NOW IS USE SOME OF THESE SPRUCE BRANCHES AND STUFF THESE RIGHT DOWN INTO THE HOLE. AND THE IDEA OF THIS IS THAT THIS, HOPEFULLY, STOPS THE HOLE FREEZING OVER. THIS IS WHERE MOST PEOPLE GET THIS WRONG, IS THAT THEY GO TO ALL THE EFFORT TO MAKE THEIR LINES, THEIR HOOKS GET THROUGH THE ICE -- THEY MIGHT EVEN CATCH SOME FISH, BUT WHEN THEY COME TO GET IT, THEIR HOLE'S FROZEN OVER. DON'T WAIT AROUND TO SEE IF THE FISH BITE. IN SURVIVAL SITUATIONS, YOU SHOULDN'T JUST RELY ON ONE SOURCE OF FOOD. I'VE JUST BEEN WATCHING A PAIR OF GOLDEN EAGLES CIRCLING ABOVE ME. IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL SIGHT. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THEY ARE NOT JUST CIRCLING FOR FUN. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR FOOD, AND I'M PRETTY CERTAIN WHAT THEY ARE AFTER IS THE OWNER OF THESE PRINTS. I'VE JUST COME ACROSS THESE, AND THESE ARE PROBABLY, I THINK, FOX PRINTS. AND YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE PAW AND ACTUALLY THE CLAW MARKS IN THERE. I FOLLOW THE FOX'S TRACKS. THEN, I SEE HIM. I'M HOPING THAT HE'S HUNTING RABBITS. IF HE GETS ONE, MY PLAN IS TO CHASE HIM OFF THE KILL AND TAKE THE MEAT MYSELF. [ RUSTLING ] BUT HE'S HEARD ME. THERE WILL BE NO RABBIT FOR DINNER TONIGHT, AND I DIDN'T CATCH ANY TROUT, EITHER, BUT IF YOU'RE LUCKIER THAN ME, MY ADVICE IS JUST GET STUCK IN. THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MAKE A FIRE ON THIS AND COOK IT, BUT THESE TROUTS ARE JUST FINE TO EAT RAW. AND IF I GET MY FINGER IN HIS GILLS HERE AND BITE INTO THIS, AND AS SOON AS I BITE INTO IT, IT'S GONNA BREAK ITS SPINAL CORD AND WILL KILL IT. [ GRUNTING ] THAT IS SO GOOD. I'M HEADING BACK TO THE TREE LINE SO I CAN SHOW THE BEST SPOT TO BUILD A SHELTER AND GET A FIRE GOING. THIS IS OLD MAN'S BEARD, A CLIMBING PLANT WHICH ATTACHES ITSELF TO TREES. AND THIS MAKES GREAT TINDER FOR A FIRE, AND I WANT TO BE COLLECTING SOME OF THIS. WHAT IT DOES, SINCE IT'S SO DRY AND BRISTLE, IT CATCHES A SPARK REALLY EASILY. SO, TAKE SOME OF THAT. KEEP THAT FOR LATER, DRY IT OFF IN MY POCKET. YEAH, LOOK -- HERE YOU GO. THIS STUFF IS COOL. IT'S CALLED SPHAGNUM, SPHAGNUM MOSS IS WHAT THIS IS, AND IT CAN ACT AS AN ANTISEPTIC. IF YOU GET A CUT, YOU WIPE THE WOUND WITH IT, AND IT WILL CLEAN IT. NOW YOU'D WANT TO FIND THE RIGHT PLACE TO BUILD YOUR SHELTER. WHAT MAKES A REAL DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU'RE MAKING SHELTERS IN THESE VALLEYS IS TO TRY AND PICK THESE SOUTH-FACING SLOPES, AND BECAUSE THEY SEE MORE OF THE SUN, IT MEANS THE TREES AND THE ROCKS RETAIN MORE OF THEIR WARMTH. OKAY, I CAN EASY MAKE A SHELTER TUCKED UNDER THIS LITTLE SPRUCE TREE HERE, REALLY WITH A MINIMUM OF EFFORT. ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS TAKE THIS RUCKSACK PARACHUTE OFF. ALL I'VE GOT TO DO IS CLEAR A BIT OF A PLATFORM, CLEAR THIS SNOW AWAY, BREAK OFF SOME OF THESE BRANCHES, AND INSULATE THE BOTTOM WITH A LOAD OF PINE AND PUT SOME MORE SPRUCE BRANCHES ABOVE AGAIN TO INSULATE ME FROM ABOVE, AND THIS WILL MAKE A PERFECTLY GOOD SHELTER. IT'S EASY TO CUT AND THREAD THE SUPPLE PINE BRANCHES TO MAKE A SHELTER TO PROTECT YOU FROM THE WORST OF THE WEATHER. [ GRUNTS ] AND NOW IT'S TIME TO MAKE A FIRE, BUT DON'T LEAVE IT TOO LATE. OUT HERE, YOU SHOULD ALLOW PLENTY OF TIME TO DO THIS. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ABOUT MAKING A FIRE, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE COLD AND YOU'RE TIRED AT THE END OF A DAY IS PREPARATION. IT'S NO GOOD SPENDING A LOT OF EFFORT TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF TINDER GOING AND THEN REALIZE THAT YOU'VE GOT NO KINDLING TO FUEL THAT FIRE. SO WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A REALLY GOOD BASE FOR IT OF QUITE DAMP WORD THAT'S GONNA SUPPORT IT, ALSO LET SOME AIR GET TO IT. I'VE GOT A BANK OF SNOW 'ROUND HERE THAT'S GONNA ACT AS A REFLECTOR AND REFLECT THE HEAT BACK TO ME. I'VE GOT MY TINDER, SOME KINDLING, AND SOME BIGGER WOOD. AND THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DO IS TRY AND GET SOME OF THIS TINDER GOING, AND THE WAY I'M GONNA DO THAT -- I'VE GOT JUST A STRIKER AND A FLINT, AND I ALWAYS CARRY THIS WITH ME -- OBVIOUSLY NOT WHEN I'M AT HOME, 'CAUSE THAT WOULD JUST BE WEIRD. BUT WHENEVER I'M OUTSIDE, THIS IS THE ONE THING I ALWAYS HAVE HANGING 'ROUND MY NECK. THAT MEANS WHATEVER THE SITUATION, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A FIRE GOING... OR SO THE THEORY GOES. AND THIS IS THE CRITICAL TIME. THEY ALWAYS SAY, IF YOU INVEST THE EFFORT EARLY ON IN A FIRE, THAT'S THE TIME THAT REALLY, REALLY MATTERS. NOW TO MAKE SOME DRINKING WATER. WHAT I CAN DO NOW IS A LITTLE TRICK, WHAT THEY CALL FINNISH MARSHMALLOWS, AND IF I JUST GET A BIT OF WOOD LIKE THIS AND THEN GRAB A BIT OF SNOW. JAM THAT ONTO THE END OF A BIT OF STICK. STICK IT INTO THIS. WHOOPS. GET ON THERE. STAY ON, YOU BRUTE, AND PUT THIS UNDERNEATH IT, AND THE HEAT OF THE FIRE WILL SLOWLY MELT THAT. IT WILL DRIP INTO THE CUP, AND WHILE I'M RELAXING, I SHOULD HAVE A GLASS OF WATER IN THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE. I CAN NOW BOIL SOME WATER FOR A CUP OF SPRUCE TEA. IT TASTES GOOD AND WILL GIVE YOU VALUABLE VITAMIN C, UP TO EIGHT TIMES MORE THAN ORANGE JUICE. BUT IT'S NOT ALL OVER, AND TRUDGING THROUGH THE SOFT SNOW MAKES PROGRESS PAINFULLY SLOW. BUT THERE IS ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION -- TO TRY AND MAKE A PAIR OF SNOW SHOES. >> I'M IN THE FRENCH ALPS. I'M AMONGST THE TREES ON THE LOWER SLOPES, AND HERE, THE DANGERS ARE MORE HIDDEN. FIRST VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY FOR A WHILE. IT'S JUST BEEN BURIED IN THIS DENSE, DENSE WOOD. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] I'M JUST PRAYING IT'S GOING TO STOP RAINING, BECAUSE IT'S MAKING IT BLOODY HORRIBLE. THERE IS, THOUGH, ONE THING I CAN DO -- TO TRY AND GET A VIEW ABOVE THE TREES. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] BUT THERE'S NOTHING AROUND. THERE'S NOTHING FOR IT BUT JUST TO KEEP MOVING DOWN. BUT THE FURTHER YOU DESCEND, THE WARMER IT GETS, AND THE SNOW BECOMES SOFTER, AND IT MAKES WALKING ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. [ GRUNTS ] BUT THERE'S A SURVIVAL TRICK THAT MAKES TRAVELING A LOT EASIER. I'M GONNA SHOW HOW TO MAKE A PAIR OF SNOW SHOES. I'VE GOT THESE YOUNG SAPLINGS HERE THAT I'VE CUT. AND IF I TAKE ONE OF THESE, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO, HOPEFULLY, BEND THIS ALL THE WAY 'ROUND, TRY AND DO IT WITHOUT IT SNAPPING. AND THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY BE THE SHOE. I'LL TAKE THESE ONES OFF. AND THAT'S MY FRAME NOW HERE. AND WHAT I NEED TO DO IS PUT A COUPLE OF CROSSBEAMS IN AND THEN JUST INTERWEAVE IT WITH MY PARACHUTE RIGGING LINES AND THEN ATTACH MY BOOT TO IT. AND THAT WILL BE READY TO GO, AND IT'S GONNA MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST JOB. [ Chuckling ] AND IT'S COVERED NOW IN BLOOD. BUT IT'S GONNA DO. SNOW SHOES WILL SPREAD THE WEIGHT OF YOUR BODY ACROSS A LARGER AREA OF THE SNOW, GIVING YOU A MUCH BETTER CHANCE OF STAYING ON TOP OF THE CRUST AND NOT SINKING IN. THIS SNOWSHOE IS ALMOST FINISHED NOW. I'VE FINISHED THE CROSS BRACING. I'VE REINFORCED IT WITH ANOTHER BIT OF SAPLING AROUND THE OUTSIDE. ALL I NEED NOW IS JUST TO MEASURE UP WHERE MY FEET ARE GOING TO GO. ONE THERE AND THAT ONE BACK HERE. OKAY, MARK THAT ONE. THESE ARE THREADED ON. I'LL TIE MY BOOT IN. AND THEN ROBERT'S YOUR FATHER'S BROTHER. OR BOB'S YOUR UNCLE. AND THIS IS GONNA MAKE SNOW TRAVEL A LOAD EASIER FOR ME. NOW TO TRY THEM OUT. AND THE SNOW SHOES ARE WORKING. EVEN THOUGH IT'S STILL TIRING, IT'S DEFINITELY LESS TIRING THAN THE THIGH-DEEP SNOW I WAS TRYING TO DEAL WITH BEFORE. IT JUST MEANS I STAY ON THE SURFACE OF THE SNOW. I KNOW AS SOON AS I TAKE IT OFF, 'CAUSE I'VE TRIED A COUPLE OF TIMES, I SINK STRAIGHT BACK DOWN AGAIN. IT'S BEEN A GRUELING JOURNEY -- COLD, OFTEN WET. BUT IF I'VE LEARNED ONE THING, THEN IT'S THIS -- THESE MOUNTAINS MAY LOOK BEAUTIFUL AND BE THE PERFECT PLACE FOR A HOLIDAY, BUT THEY CAN BE TREACHEROUS, AND THEY DEMAND THE UTMOST RESPECT.
