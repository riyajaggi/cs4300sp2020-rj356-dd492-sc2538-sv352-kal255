 Man vs. Wild (2006â€“2020): Season 1, Episode 7 - African Savannah - full transcript 
 More than 100,000 Americans visit Kenya each year in search of a safari. But what they don't know about life in the wild can kill them. Bear surveys the Kenyan landscape from a hot air balloon, then he parachutes down onto the arid plain. Upon hitting the ground, Bear is immediately surrounded by dangerous animals, including rhinoceros, lions, leopards, elephants, and buffalo. Traveling across the African plains, Bear demonstrates how to navigate by the stars, track a lion kill, cross crocodile and hippo-filled rivers and drink the water squeezed from elephant dung!

 >> MY NAME IS BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES. I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW MY CHALLENGE IS TO PARACHUTE INTO NORTHERN KENYA. MILLIONS OF VISITORS COME TO KENYA EACH YEAR ON SAFARI, BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS HOW

 QUICKLY THINGS CAN TURN DEADLY. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO SURVIVE OUT HERE. I'M 6,500 FEET ABOVE NORTHERN KENYA'S WILD SAVANNA. EVERY YEAR, OVER 2 MILLION PEOPLE COME TO KENYA TO WITNESS THE RAW BEAUTY OF NATURE. MANY VISITORS SEE KENYA'S WILDLIFE FROM BALLOONS. RECENTLY, ONE CRASHED, KILLING 2 PEOPLE AND INJURING 11. THE SURVIVORS WERE STRANDED IN A COUNTRY WHERE ATTACKS BY WILD

 ANIMALS ACCOUNT FOR AROUND 70 DEATHS EACH YEAR. I'M GONNA PUT MYSELF IN THE POSITION OF SOMEONE LOST OUT HERE, TO SHOW HOW TO STAY ALIVE IN ONE OF NATURE'S MOST DANGEROUS PLACES. IF NEEDED, I'LL BE RECEIVING SOME HELP FROM LOCAL EXPERTS, AND A FILM CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. THE LAST TIME I PARACHUTED IN AFRICA, IT WENT VERY WRONG, AND I BROKE MY BACK IN THREE PLACES. SO, HERE GOES. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] WHOA! IT'S GONNA BE A FAST LANDING, THIS ONE. OHH. I REALLY SMACKED MY ARM. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- I'M RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AFRICAN FOOD CHAIN HERE. EVERY PREDATOR AROUND WILL BE ABLE TO SEE AND SMELL ME. AND I WANT TO GET MOVING PRETTY QUICKLY. KENYA IS HOME TO AROUND 3,000 SPECIES OF WILD ANIMALS, ALL OF THEM ROAMING FREE. MANY IN SAVANNA GRASSLAND JUST LIKE THIS, AND AMONGST THEM, SOME OF THE MOST FEROCIOUS PREDATORS ON EARTH. IT'S MIDDAY. THERE'S AN INTENSE DRY HEAT, AND THE FIRST THING THAT STRIKES YOU IS A MUSTY ANIMAL SMELL. {\an8}THESE ARE LION TRACKS. {\an8}LOOK. {\an8}LOOK AT THIS. {\an8}YOU CAN SEE THE EDGE. {\an8}YEAH, LOOK. {\an8}COME OVER HERE AND LOOK. {\an8}THIS IS AN EVEN BETTER ONE. {\an8}LOOK AT THAT. THESE ARE LARGE TRACKS. THERE'S AT LEAST ONE LION, AND THIS IS IDEAL HUNTING TERRITORY FOR THEM. LOOK AT THIS. YOU CAN SEE THE ACTUAL INDENTATION OF ITS PAW IN THERE AND ITS CLAWS, AND THIS TRACK IS PRETTY FRESH. I CAN TELL THAT THESE ARE RECENT BECAUSE EVEN IN THIS SOFT SAND, THEY'RE STILL CLEARLY DEFINED. GENERALLY, YOU'RE MOST VULNERABLE IF THEY'RE PROTECTING THEIR YOUNG OR IF THEY'RE CORNERED OR IF YOU SURPRISE THEM, AND THIS IS WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS SORT OF TERRAIN, IS JUST STUMBLING UPON THEM. YOU KNOW, IF THEY'RE MATING, FOR EXAMPLE, NOBODY LIKES TO BE INTERRUPTED THEN. AND THE BOTTOM LINE HERE -- IN AFRICA, THERE ARE MAN-EATING LIONS AROUND. PEOPLE OFTEN GET INTO TROUBLE HERE WHEN THEIR VEHICLES BREAK DOWN AND THEY ABANDON THEM, RISKING ANIMAL ATTACK AND DEHYDRATION. THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF WALKING SAFARIS HAS ALSO LED TO VISITORS BEING KILLED OR INJURED IN ENCOUNTERS WITH WILDLIFE. IF YOU'RE LOST OUT HERE, THE FIRST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS TO FIND A LANDMARK OR FIXED POINT TO AIM FOR, AND FOR ME, IT'S GONNA BE THAT MOUNTAIN. ON THE SHOULDER OF THE MOUNTAIN, I CAN SEE A GLACIER. THAT MEANS MELTWATER FORMING INTO STREAMS AND RIVERS. THE SUN IS NOW MOVING TOWARDS THE WEST, WHICH MEANS THE MOUNTAIN AHEAD OF ME IS MORE OR LESS DUE SOUTH, MAYBE 30 MILES. ALL AROUND ME IS EVIDENCE OF WILDLIFE. ELEPHANTS UP AHEAD. I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY THERE ARE. LOOKS LIKE A BREEDING HERD. LARGE HERBIVORES, SUCH AS ELEPHANT, BUFFALO, OR RHINO, CAN KILL IF DISTURBED. I WANT TO BE PRETTY CAREFUL OF THESE GUYS. ELEPHANTS ARE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANIMALS, BUT THEY'RE ALSO VERY PROTECTIVE OF THEIR YOUNG. AND LOOK -- THIS YOUNG BULL HAS NOW SPOTTED ME. AND THIS IS QUITE AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION. BUT HE'S TURNING AWAY. BUT ELEPHANT CHARGES IN AFRICA ARE ACTUALLY QUITE COMMON. AND A FEW YEARS AGO, THERE WAS A LADY OUT ON SAFARI, AND THEY CAME ACROSS A HERD JUST LIKE THIS, AND THE BIG BULL ELEPHANT BROKE FREE OF THE HERD AND CHARGED HER, TRAMPLED HER, AND SHE DIED OF MASSIVE INJURIES. AND HE'S DEFINITELY CHECKING ME OUT. I TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE HERD TO SHOW I'M NO THREAT, BUT NOW THEY'RE CHALLENGING ME. AND THAT'S THE MATRIARCH OF THE HERD. THE MATRIARCH ALWAYS MOVES TO THE FRONT OF THE HERD, READY TO ATTACK. SHE'S NOT HAPPY NOW. AND EVERY TIME I TRY AND GET 'ROUND, SHE'S, LIKE, BACKING ME OFF. AND THEY'VE ALL NOW JUST STOPPED AND TURNING AND LOOKING AT ME. SHE GAVE ME, LIKE, A SHAKE OF HER HEAD, TELLING ME SHE'S ANNOYED. BUT I THINK THEY'RE GONNA MOVE OFF THIS WAY NOW. NOPE, THEY'RE COMING AROUND. THEY'RE COMING AROUND THIS WAY. GUYS, YOU NEED TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. AND THEY'RE JUST SIZING US UP HERE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- THIS IS A BATTLE I DON'T EVEN WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN. I'M GONNA HEAD THIS WAY. YOU CAN TELL WHEN AN ELEPHANT'S ABOUT TO CHARGE. THEY'LL OFTEN FLATTEN THEIR EARS AGAINST THEIR BODIES AND CURL THEIR TRUNKS. IF THIS HAPPENS, DON'T JUST RUN IN ONE DIRECTION, BUT TURN SHARPLY TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT. BECAUSE OF ITS POOR EYESIGHT, THE ELEPHANT MAY CONTINUE TO CHARGE RIGHT PAST YOU. IN A PLACE LIKE THIS, YOU'D WANT TO HEAD FOR HIGH GROUND SO YOU CAN SEE THE TERRAIN AHEAD. I'M GONNA TRY AND REACH THE TOP OF THAT ROCKY OUTCROP AHEAD, JUST SO IT CAN ACT AS A GOOD HIGH POINT TO GET A VIEW OF ALL THE SURROUNDING AREA, TO FIND MY BEARINGS, SEE IF I CAN SEE ANY PROMINENT LANDMARKS OR ANY RIVERS OR STREAMS. BUT CLIMBING THESE OUTCROPS IS NEVER AS SIMPLE AS IT MIGHT LOOK. MY DAD ALWAYS USED TO SAY, WHEN WE WERE CLIMBING, "YOU CAN NEVER TELL HOW STEEP SOMETHING IS UNTIL YOU LITERALLY RUB NOSES WITH IT." AND I CAN SEE HERE, THERE'S A CRACK RUNNING STRAIGHT UP THE MIDDLE, BUT THIS IS QUITE A TECHNICAL CLIMB. YOU KNOW, IT'S SMOOTH ROCK, AND IT'S NEAR VERTICAL. BUT EVEN WITH A SAFETY ROPE, I NEED TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL. SO MUCH OF CLIMBING IS JUST ABOUT BALANCE AND KEEPING YOUR BODY WEIGHT INTO THE FACE AND THEN USING YOUR LEG POWER TO LIFT YOU UP. [ GRUNTS ] IF I CAN JUST REACH THIS... LITTLE LIP UP HERE. HERE WE GO. 1, 2, 3. [ EXHALING SHARPLY ] WHAT I CAN ALSO DO HERE, IN THIS CRACK, IS USE MY HAND AND JAM IT IN AND THEN MAKE IT INTO A FIST. AND THAT MEANS I CAN LEAN OUT ON IT TO REST OR PULL MYSELF UP. AND JUST REACH THIS LAST LEDGE, I'M OVER THE TOP. [ GRUNTING ] I'M GONNA SHOW YOU NOW HOW TO DEAL WITH A PUFF ADDER. YOU DO NOT WANT TO RUN INTO ONE OF THESE. THIS SNAKE HAS THE FASTEST STRIKE ON EARTH. >> I'M IN KENYA'S VAST WILDERNESS TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SURVIVE HERE, BUT RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME IS THE DEADLIEST SNAKE IN ALL OF AFRICA -- THE PUFF ADDER. THESE SNAKES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE HUMAN DEATHS IN AFRICA THAN ANY OTHER. BITTEN BY ONE OF THESE WITHOUT ANTIVENOM, YOU'VE GOT A DAY TO LIVE. THERE YOU GO. LOOK, HE'S SEEN ME THERE. HE DOESN'T LIKE THAT. AND THEY'RE DANGEROUS -- NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY AGGRESSIVE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY PRETTY SLOW, FAT, AND LAZY. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM, IS THAT THEY DON'T MOVE OUT OF THE WAY WHEN YOU'RE NEAR IT. THEY TEND TO BASK IN GRASS JUST LIKE THIS. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY'RE INCREDIBLY HARD TO SPOT. PEOPLE WALKING IN AFRICA STUMBLE UPON THEM ALL THE TIME, UNINTENTIONALLY PROVOKING AN ATTACK. THEY HAVE ENOUGH VENOM TO KILL UP TO SIX MEN. PUFF ADDERS CAN STRIKE THEIR BODY LENGTH IN UNDER A SECOND. ONCE YOU GET TO THE TOP OF AN OUTCROP, YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET THE LIE OF THE LAND, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, LOOK FOR SIGNS OF WATER. WATCH WHERE YOU PUT YOUR HANDS. THERE'S A RIVERBED, AND THAT'S GONNA BE YOUR BEST CHANCE OF GETTING WATER. TO CONSERVE WHAT WATER YOU HAVE, YOU'LL NEED TO GET OUT OF THE SUN, SO KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR SHELTER. HERE'S SOMETHING THE MASAI TRIBESPEOPLE USE FOR TREATING CUTS AND WOUNDS. THIS IS WHAT I WANT -- SOME OF THIS ALOE. AND THESE PLANTS ARE GREAT. THEY'RE USED ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR THEIR MEDICINAL PROPERTIES. THEY'RE SOOTHING. AND TAKE ONE OF THE OUTER ONES HERE. YOU CAN TELL ALOES FROM THEIR TUBULAR FLOWERS AND BY THEIR THICK, FLESHY LEAVES WITH SERRATED EDGES. WHAT I DO IS GET IT LIKE THIS AND CUT IT STRAIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. AND THEN ALL I HAVE TO DO IS STREAK IT TO LET THE JUICES BEGIN TO COME OUT OF IT. BUT YOUR PRIORITY NOW WILL BE TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO STAY OUT OF THE SUN. LOOK AT THIS GAME TRAIL. THIS IS DEFINITELY LEADING SOMEWHERE. YEAH, THIS IS GONNA BE A GREAT PLACE JUST TO GET SOME SHADE. BUT I'LL TELL YOU -- I'M NOT GONNA BE THE ONLY LIVING THING THAT'S HAD THIS IDEA. THESE ARE RHINO PRINTS HERE, AND THERE'S EVEN AN OLD BUFFALO DROPPINGS HERE. RHINO AND BUFFALO ARE EXTREMELY TERRITORIAL AND CAN KILL INTRUDERS. AND I KNOW THERE ARE ALSO LION NEARBY, SO BLOCK UP THE ENTRANCE. EVEN THE MOST BASIC BARRICADE IS OFTEN ENOUGH TO DETER WILD ANIMALS. AND THIS IS JUST OLD ACACIA BRANCHES FOR PUTTING ACROSS HERE. IT'S ACTUALLY AN OLD MASAI TRICK, THIS. THE GREAT THING ABOUT ACACIA IS THAT ITS NEEDLE-SHARP BARBS PROVIDE A VERY THORNY PROBLEM FOR ANY POTENTIAL INTRUDERS. BUT IF ANY WILD ANIMAL DOES GET THROUGH MY BARRIER, I NEED A SECONDARY LINE OF DEFENSE. I'M USING MY KNIFE AND A STICK TO MAKE A PRIMITIVE SPEAR. AND THAT'S, THEN, A REALLY GOOD WEAPON -- EXTENDS MY REACH AND WILL ALLOW ME TO PROTECT MYSELF IF I NEED TO. IT'S 20 DEGREES COOLER IN THE CAVE. AND BY RESTING A FEW HOURS, I'VE AVOIDED THE WORST OF THE SUN. IT'S ABOUT 3:00 P.M. NOW, AND THE HEAT OF THE DAY IS DEFINITELY DYING. IT'S MUCH COOLER. AND 'CAUSE WE'RE NEAR THE EQUATOR, IT SHOULD BE DARK RIGHT ABOUT 7:00. IT'S TIME TO GO. I'M GOING DOWN TO THE VALLEY FLOOR TO FIND WATER. [ SIGHS ] [ SIGHS ] NOT QUITE -- NOT QUITE THE GUSHING TORRENT I WAS LOOKING FOR. AND THERE'S NOTHING TO DRINK HERE. AND THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. ALL THERE IS, IS THIS STAGNANT POOL OF WATER. AND LOOK -- A DEAD TORTOISE, A GOOD INDICATOR THIS IS NOT GOOD WATER TO DRINK FROM. IT'S PROBABLY GOT, LIKE, YOU KNOW, PARASITES. IT'S GOT REEDS UP THERE, AND THEY HARBOR OFTEN BILHARZIA, WHICH IS A REALLY NASTY PARASITE THAT CAN GIVE YOU BAD DIARRHEA. IT'S VITAL TO KEEP DRINKING, AND OUT HERE YOU CAN FIND FLUIDS IN THE MOST UNLIKELY OF PLACES. >> I'M IN NORTHERN KENYA, WHERE MILLIONS OF TOURISTS COME TO EXPERIENCE NATURE, BUT EVERY YEAR, 70 PEOPLE DIE IN ATTACKS BY WILD ANIMALS. IN HOT CLIMATES, IF YOU TRY TO WALK IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY WITH NO WATER, YOU MAY LAST NO MORE THAN FOUR HOURS. BUT IF IT'S A CHOICE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH, THERE'S A SURVIVAL TRICK I WAS SHOWN BY AN OLD RANGER. ONE THING YOU CAN DO IF YOU'RE STUCK OUT HERE WITH NO WATER SOURCE AT ALL IS ACTUALLY DRINK THE FLUID FROM FRESH ELEPHANT DUNG. PRETTY DISGUSTING, BUT IT COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE. UGH! THERE CAN BE HARMFUL BACTERIA IN THAT WATER, BUT IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DRINK, IT COULD BUY YOU EXTRA TIME. NOT ONE OF THE BETTER DRINKS I'VE EVER HAD. LOOK AT THIS LAND. IT'S JUST COMPLETELY FEATURELESS, AND IT'S SO EASY TO GET LOST HERE. AND IF YOU WERE LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, WITH NO IDEA WHERE YOU ARE, ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO IS JUST TO PICK ONE DIRECTION AND STICK WITH IT. AND THE BEST WAY OF STICKING ON YOUR BEARING IS TO PICK A DIRECTION IN THE DISTANCE -- LET'S SAY, YOU LOOK UNDER THIS TREE, SEE THAT GREEN BUSH OVER THERE -- PICK THAT. WALK TO IT, AND WHEN I GET TO THAT, TURN BACK. SEE WHERE I'VE COME FROM, FROM THIS TREE. LINE UP THE NEXT MARK AND THEN WALK TO THAT. BUT, OBVIOUSLY, THE DISTANCES WOULD BE MUCH GREATER, BUT THAT'S THE IDEA -- JUST GOING POINT TO POINT AND STICKING WITH IT. ALSO, KEEP A LOOKOUT FOR ANIMAL TRACKS, WHICH COULD LEAD YOU TO WATER. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THESE GAME TRAILS HERE, AND THEY'RE ALL LEADING DOWN THE VALLEY. AND, YEAH, LOOK AT THIS. THEY ALL, LIKE, CONVERGE LIKE AN ARROW -- COME TOGETHER, AS IF THEY'RE POINTING WHICH WAY TO FIND WATER. BUT THESE MIGHT BE OLD TRAILS, AND IT IS THE DRY SEASON, WHERE MANY WATER HOLES SIMPLY DRY UP. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SOURCE OF WATER, THIS. LOOK, IT'S FLOWING, AND IT'S LOOKING PRETTY CLEAR. AND THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF PLACE THAT ANIMALS WOULD COME DOWN TO DRINK. AND, YEAH, MAN, LOOK AT THIS. LOOK. THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. LOOK. THESE ARE -- THESE ARE LION TRACKS, THESE. LOOK. [ GRUNTS ] THESE LIONS ARE AMBUSH PREDATORS, AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I STAND TALL AND I DON'T CROUCH DOWN. WHEN I CROUCH DOWN, I'M SAYING THAT I'M PREY. SO I WANT TO FILL THIS WATER BOTTLE PRETTY QUICKLY. THE BEST ADVICE IS ALWAYS TO BOIL WATER TO PURIFY IT BEFORE YOU DRINK, BUT THAT TAKES TIME WHICH YOU MAY NOT HAVE. HEY, LOOK, YOU WANT TO WATCH OUT FOR THIS BUSH. THIS IS -- YEAH, THIS IS A "WAIT-A-BIT" BUSH, KNOWN THROUGHOUT AFRICA. IF YOU STUMBLE ACROSS ONE OF THESE, YOU'RE GONNA KNOW ABOUT IT. IT WILL TAKE YOU HOURS TO GET OUT OF. WATCH HOW SHARP THESE BARBS ARE. THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. LOOK. IF I JUST BACK INTO IT A LITTLE BIT, AND -- OW! OH! I'M GENUINELY... COMPLETELY STUCK AND... [ GRUNTS ] [ SIGHS ] DIGS RIGHT -- OW! -- INTO YOU. LOOK AT MY HAND HERE. LOOK. JUST COMPLETELY CAUGHT ON IT. THAT IS A PAIN. YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE STUMBLING INTO THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. ALL RIGHT, COME ON. I'VE GOT WATER, BUT IF YOU DON'T, IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY, YOU'LL BE CRIPPLED BY DEHYDRATION BEFORE THE DAY IS OUT. BUT IF YOU REST IN THE DAY AND WALK AT NIGHT, YOU COULD LAST TWICE AS LONG. BUT THE PROBLEM IS, NIGHTTIME IS WHEN PREDATORS ARE MOST ACTIVE. DURING MY TIME WITH THE SPECIAL FORCES, WE'D ONLY MOVE AT NIGHT. AND IF YOU DO THIS, THERE ARE CERTAIN SKILLS YOU NEED TO KNOW. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVEN'T GOT THE SUN TO NAVIGATE BY, DURING THE NIGHT, WHAT I HAVE GOT IS THE MOON. AND IN THE SAME WAY THAT THE SUN RISES IN THE EAST AND SETS IN THE WEST, SO DOES THE MOON FOLLOW THAT ROUGH TRAJECTORY ACROSS THE SKY. AND TONIGHT'S A REALLY BIG, FULL MOON, AND I'VE JUST BEEN WATCHING IT MOVE STEADILY ACROSS THE SKY ABOVE ME, SHOWING ME THAT'S TOWARDS THE WEST AND THAT'S SOUTH, WHERE I'M HEADING. WALKING AT NIGHT, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE, AND YOU HAVE TO USE ALL OF YOUR SENSES. TAKES ABOUT 45 MINUTES TO GET YOUR NIGHT VISION. BUT WHEN IT DOES COME, ESPECIALLY WITH A FULL MOON LIKE THIS, IT'S ALMOST LIKE WALKING IN DAYLIGHT. AND WHEN YOU DO GET YOUR NIGHT VISION, YOU WANT TO PROTECT IT. SO IF YOU HAVE TO TURN A TORCH ON TO READ A MAP OR SOMETHING, JUST COVER ONE EYE. AND, ALSO, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT SOMETHING IN DETAIL, USE THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE. YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION IS MUCH MORE SENSITIVE THAN YOUR FOCAL VISION DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF YOU, AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EARLY MAN DEVELOPED AS A GOOD WAY OF PROTECTING OURSELVES AGAINST PREDATORS IN TERRAIN JUST LIKE THIS. SOMETHING MOVES SILENTLY AHEAD OF ME, STOPPING ME IN MY TRACKS... A LONE ELEPHANT. JUST BACK UP, GUYS, A LITTLE BIT. THIS ELEPHANT IS INCREDIBLY CLOSE, AND I JUST DIDN'T HEAR HIM COMING. THEY MOVE SO STEALTHILY. HIS EYESIGHT ISN'T GREAT AT NIGHT, BUT HIS SENSE OF SMELL REMAINS KEEN. IF HE CATCHES WIND OF ME, HE COULD ATTACK. I DON'T WANT THIS GUY TO SEE ME, JUST BECAUSE I'M SO VULNERABLE AT NIGHTTIME, AND I DO NOT WANT HIM CHARGING AT ME. I'M JUST GONNA LET HIM PASS HERE. OKAY, COME ON. LET'S GO. MOVING AT NIGHT IN THE SAVANNA IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER, AND YOU SHOULD ONLY DO IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. AND THERE'S THE MOUNTAIN THAT I'M HEADING FOR. IT MAY SEEM TANTALIZINGLY CLOSE, BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF GROUND TO CROSS, AND YOU NEED TO COVER AS MUCH OF IT AS POSSIBLE BEFORE IT GETS TOO HOT. IF YOU NEED TO EAT, THERE'S A READY SOURCE OF PROTEIN AROUND HERE -- SCORPIONS. ACTUALLY, THE SMALLER THEY ARE, THE MORE POTENT THE STING, AND I'VE GOT HIM JUST BY THE STINGER, RIGHT ON THE TIP OF HIS TAIL, AND THESE ARE JUST THE PINCERS THAT HE USES TO HOLD HIS PREY. AND AS LONG AS I BITE HIM OFF JUST BELOW THE STINGER, THIS GUY IS EDIBLE, AND I'M JUST GONNA TAKE MAYBE A PINCER OFF FIRST. [ CRUNCHING ] WE'LL JUST DO IT IN ONE. MAYBE IT WAS EASIER. [ GROANS ] LOOK, THE STINGER'S STILL WIGGLING AWAY. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, SCORPIONS ARE DISGUSTING! UGH! BUT IN KENYA'S WILD SAVANNA, YOU'LL OFTEN COME ACROSS THINGS YOU JUST DON'T EXPECT TO FIND. WOW! LOOK AT THIS! JUST A MASSIVE OLD VOLCANIC CRATER. I THINK I CAN SEE HOLES IN THE CRATER FLOOR. THEY COULD BE MANMADE. >> I'M IN NORTHERN KENYA, AND IN SAVANNA LIKE THIS, YOU'RE CONSTANTLY AT RISK FROM ANIMAL ATTACK, DEHYDRATION, AND HEATSTROKE. I'M HERE TO SHOW HOW TO GET OUT ALIVE. I'M ON THE RIM OF AN EXTINCT VOLCANO, AND THERE ARE SIGNS OF HUMAN ACTIVITY AT THE BOTTOM, SO THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING. BUT THE SIDES OF THIS CRATER ARE STEEP SLOPES OF VOLCANIC SHINGLE. THE FASTEST WAY DOWN A SHINGLE FACE LIKE THIS IS TO SCREE-RUN IT. YOU NEED TO DIG YOUR HEELS IN AND THEN USE YOUR HANDS FOR BALANCE, ZIGZAGGING YOUR WAY DOWN. WHOA! OW! [ COUGHING ] THAT WAS FAST. I MUST HAVE INHALED HALF THE MOUNTAIN IN DUST. THIS PLACE IS LONG DESERTED, AND I'M NOT SURPRISED. THIS CRATER IS A REAL HEAT TRAP. IT'S EVEN HOTTER HERE THAN UP ON THE SAVANNA. WHAT LOOKED LIKE SIGNS OF HABITATION ARE ACTUALLY ABANDONED SALT WORKINGS. BUT AT LEAST THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING HERE THAT YOU COULD USE. OHH. OH, THIS STUFF IS SO CRUSTY AND SOFT, AND THIS BIT HERE THAT LOOKS LIKE TAR IS ACTUALLY SALT. AND IT MIGHT NOT BE THE TYPE YOU'RE USED TO, ON YOUR TABLE, NICE AND REFINED, BUT IT IS ACTUALLY SALT. AND IF I BREAK A BIT OFF HERE, IT WILL REPLACE LOST MINERAL SALTS THAT I'M LOSING ALL THE TIME THROUGH SWEATING. AND, ALSO, IT WILL ACTUALLY ACT AS AN ELECTROLYTE IF YOU'VE GOT DIARRHEA. IT WAS MUCH EASIER GETTING INTO THIS CRATER THAN GETTING OUT OF IT, AND I'VE USED UP A LOT OF ENERGY. [ EXHALES DEEPLY ] [ SNIFFLES ] IT LOOKS LIKE THE SAVANNA'S PREDATORS HAVE BEEN BUSY. THOSE VULTURES ARE A CLEAR SIGN THAT SOMETHING HAS FALLEN PREY. BUT AS I'M WALKING TOWARDS THEM, I COME ACROSS SOMETHING ELSE. THERE'S A GROUP OF RHINO -- WHITE RHINO HERE. THIS IS JUST AMAZING TO SEE. THEY'RE PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT 50 METERS AWAY FROM ME HERE. AND I NEED TO BE PRETTY CAREFUL. YOU MUST NEVER UNDERESTIMATE RHINO. I KNOW OF TWO SOUTH AFRICAN BROTHERS THAT GOT CHARGED BY A BIG BULL RHINO, AND THEY WERE GORED AND TRAMPLED ON. THEY WERE A REAL MESS. BUT THEY EVENTUALLY GOT RESCUED, AIR-AMBULANCED OUT, AND THEY WERE DEFINITELY LUCKY, LUCKY, LUCKY TO LIVE. AND LOOK, YOU CAN SEE THERE -- THOSE TWO RHINO HAVE GONE INTO THE DEFENSIVE POSITION, WHERE THEY'VE PUT THEIR BACKSIDES TOGETHER, AND THEY FACE OUTWARDS. AND THAT'S OUR FIRST WARNING TO ME THAT I'M GETTING TOO CLOSE HERE. THEY'RE UNSURE OF ME, AND THAT FIRST WARNING MEANS THE RHINO ARE WEIGHING OUT WHETHER TO TAKE ME ON OR RUN AWAY. I'M RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THEIR COMFORT ZONE. IF I MOVE ANY FURTHER TOWARDS THEM, THEY COULD CHARGE. BUT AS WITH ELEPHANT, IF YOU EVER HAVE TO FACE A RHINO CHARGE, THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO TO SAVE YOURSELF. AND IF THEY DID TURN AND CHARGE TOWARDS ME, WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO IS HOLD MY NERVE AND NOT TRY AND JUST OUTRUN THEM, 'CAUSE I'D NEVER MANAGE TO DO THAT. YOU'VE GOT TO STAND FIRM, FACE IT, HOLD THAT NERVE. AND THEN, AT THE LAST MINUTE, DIVE TO THE SIDE, AND THEN FIND COVER. AND LOOK, YOU SEE THEM JUST BEGINNING TO EDGE TOWARDS ME NOW. OKAY, WE NEED TO FIND A WAY AROUND HERE. I'VE MOVED OUT OF THEIR THREAT ZONE. AND THEY'RE HAPPIER NOW, AND SLOWLY, THEY MOVE AWAY. THOSE VULTURES I SAW BEFORE ARE ON THE GROUND NOW AND QUITE CLOSE. THEY SHOULD HAVE TAKEN FLIGHT AT MY APPROACH, BUT THEY HAVEN'T, AND THAT CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING. LOOK AT THAT. YOU SEE THAT? THOSE VULTURES THERE -- THEY'RE SO FULL OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN FEEDING OFF, THEY CAN'T EVEN TAKE OFF. THEY'RE JUST, LIKE, WADDLING UP THE HILL. AND THIS IS WHAT THESE VULTURES HAVE BEEN AFTER. LOOK AT THIS -- A DEAD ZEBRA THAT'S DEFINITELY A LION KILL. AND YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE LIONS HAVE TAKEN IT DOWN, EATEN ALL THE MEAT, ALL THE INNARDS, AND THEN LEAVES THE BONE AND THE SKIN FOR THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE. AMAZING TO SEE IT JUST SO CLOSE. A KILL LIKE THIS CAN MEAN FOOD FOR THE SURVIVOR. AND THERE ARE WAYS YOU CAN TELL IF THE MEAT ON IT IS FIT TO EAT. VULTURES ARE THE FIRST SIGN, AS THEY WILL ONLY EAT FRESH MEAT. CHECK ALSO FOR MAGGOTS. THE LACK OF MAGGOTS TELLS ME THAT THIS KILL IS HOURS, RATHER THAN DAYS, OLD. AND IF THE CARCASS SMELLS ROTTEN, MOVE ON. BUT THIS MEAT IS FRESH AND AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF PROTEIN. AND THIS IS SO TOUGH, THE SKIN. BUT LOOK AT UNDER ALL OF THIS. I GOT TO PEEL THE SKIN BACK. [ INSECTS BUZZING ] [ GRUNTS ] AND THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW A LOT OF EARLY MAN USED TO HUNT. THEY ACTUALLY WEREN'T GREAT HUNTERS. [ GRUNTING ] [ GULPS ] THEY WERE ACTUALLY GOOD SCAVENGERS, PICKERS OF BERRIES, AND OPPORTUNISTIC, FOLLOWING OUT WHERE LIONS WOULD EAT. [ COUGHS ] OH, THAT'S A NASTY BIT. ONE LAST BIT. AWESOME! [ GROWLING IN DISTANCE ] I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE THAT, BUT JUST ABOUT 50 METERS UP, IN THAT THICKET, A PRIDE OF LIONS. >> I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WILD SAVANNA OF NORTHERN KENYA. AND I'M JUST YARDS AWAY FROM A PRIDE OF LIONS. THERE YOU GO. THEY'RE LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME NOW. IT LOOKS LIKE TWO LIONESSES WITH THEIR CUBS, JUST SHADING FROM THE SUN. BUT I'VE GOT TO BE SUPER CAREFUL HERE. THOSE LIONESSES ARE GONNA BE SO PROTECTIVE OF THEIR YOUNG, AND IT MEANS I NEED TO KEEP MORE DISTANCE. THEY CAN MOVE 20 METERS IN JUST OVER A SECOND -- UNBELIEVABLY FAST. AND THEIR CLAWS -- RAZOR-SHARP. ONE SWIPE, THEY'LL DISEMBOWEL A MAN. AND A BIG MALE -- IF IT WENT FOR YOU, ONE SWIPE STRAIGHT ACROSS THE NECK, COULD TAKE A MAN'S HEAD RIGHT OFF. AND THE ONLY THING I COULD DO IF IT DID GO FOR ME IS STAND TALL, PUT MY ARMS OUT WIDE, MAKE A LOT OF NOISE, CLAP, AND BASICALLY TRY AND BLUFF, 'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN RUN. THEIR INSTINCT IS TO CHASE. THEY'RE CHASE ANIMALS. THEY CAN'T HELP IT. AND IF YOU RUN, YOU'RE GONNA BE CHASED, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE DEAD. >> [ GROWLING ] >> LISTEN TO HER. LISTEN TO HER. OKAY, IT'S TIME WE NEED TO BE OUT OF HERE, GUYS. OKAY, LET'S KEEP MOVING. I'M HEADING SOUTH, AIMING FOR THAT MOUNTAIN. IF YOU'RE LOST IN THE WILDERNESS, THE USUAL ADVICE IS TO HUNT FOR A STREAM WHICH WILL LEAD TO A RIVER AND FOLLOW THAT DOWNSTREAM UNTIL YOU FIND PEOPLE. AND THAT WOULD WORK ANYWHERE, APART FROM IN AFRICA, 'CAUSE WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS HERE IS THAT YOU'LL FOLLOW THESE STREAMS AND THESE RIVERS, AND THEY'LL RUN, AND THEY'LL RUN, AND THEN THEY'LL JUST DISAPPEAR INTO THE GROUND, INTO THESE AQUIFERS, AND EFFECTIVELY INTO NOTHING. AND TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN TO YOU WOULD BE A REAL BUMMER. SO THE BEST ADVICE IN AFRICA IS ACTUALLY TO DO THE OPPOSITE THAN NORMAL AND HEAD UPSTREAM, FOLLOW THE WATER SOURCE ALL THE WAY UNTIL YOU FIND SOME SORT OF CIVILIZATION THAT WAY. AS THE MOUNTAIN GETS EVER CLOSER, THE TERRAIN CHANGES. THIS IS MUCH MORE LIKE IT NOW HERE. THIS IS LOOKING MUCH GREENER. AND THIS SHOULD BE THE START OF WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD UP TO THE FOOTHILLS. ALSO, THESE YELLOW FEVER TREES ARE GOOD INDICATORS THAT I'M NEAR A WATER SOURCE, AS ARE, ACTUALLY, THOSE BABOONS OVER THERE THAT ALWAYS HANG OUT NEAR GOOD WATER. SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS TRY AND FIND THIS WATER SOURCE AND THEN FOLLOW THAT UP INTO THE MOUNTAINS. BABOONS ARE ALSO A SIGN THAT THERE ARE NO MAJOR PREDATORS AROUND, SO THIS WOULD BE A GOOD SPOT FOR ME TO SPEND THE NIGHT. AND THIS ISN'T A BAD PLACE. WE'RE PRETTY NEAR WATER. THE PROBLEM WITH BEING NEAR WATER IS MOSQUITOES. BUT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR, WHICH THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF AROUND HERE, IS BLACKJACK, AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD INSECTICIDE. AND HERE WE GO. THERE'S ONE. JUST TAKE THIS. I CAN PUT IT STRAIGHT ONTO THE FIRE. YOU CAN TELL BLACKJACK BY ITS OVAL-SHAPED LEAVES BORDERED WITH COARSELY TOOTHED EDGES. IT GROWS ABOUT 2 FOOT LONG. AND WHEN THE FLOWERS ARE OUT, THEY HAVE PINKISH-WHITE PETALS. AND THAT WILL HELP KEEP THE MOSQUITOES AWAY. MOSQUITOES ARE THE BIGGEST KILLER OF PEOPLE IN AFRICA BECAUSE OF THE MALARIA THEY SPREAD. SO THIS WILL HELP ME. MALARIA KILLS A MILLION AFRICANS EVERY YEAR. WELL, HERE'S A STREAM. IT'S NOT MUCH, BUT IT MEANS AT LEAST I'M IN THE RIGHT AREA FOR STREAMS AND FOR RIVERS. AND ALSO, THERE'S MORE BLACKJACK FOR ME TO BURN AS A MOSQUITO REPELLENT. IT'S ALMOST DARK NOW. AND PROBABLY MY BEST CHANCE OF SHELTER IS THIS TREE. AND IT WILL MEAN AT LEAST I'M OFF THE GROUND, SO I'M NOT GONNA GET TRAMPLED BY ANY BIG GAME. I WON'T GET MY FACE BITTEN BY ANYTHING SMALLER, LIKE A HYENA. AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET SOME DECENT SLEEP. USING MY FLINT, I'M TRYING TO LIGHT SOME DRY ELEPHANT DUNG, WHICH I'M USING AS KINDLING. IT SHOULD BURN PRETTY WELL. OKAY. COME ON, NOW. AT NIGHT, THE TEMPERATURE HERE DROPS TO 45 DEGREES. HAVING A FIRE IN THE BUSH NOT ONLY KEEPS YOU WARM, IT DETERS PREDATORS AND OTHER ANIMALS, AND IT SHOULD KEEP THE MOSQUITOES AWAY. BUT LIGHTING ELEPHANT DUNG IS NOT ALWAYS THAT EASY. [ COUGHING ] OH, TELL YOU WHAT -- THE FUMES OF ELEPHANT DUNG IS REALLY NOT NICE. [ BLOWING ] WHAT I'M GONNA PUT ON IS A BIT OF THIS BLACKJACK. AND IF I JUST BREAK A LITTLE BIT OF THIS OFF AND LAY IT ONTO THE FIRE, WHEN THAT BURNS, IT ACTS AS A REALLY GOOD REPELLENT. AND WHAT I'M HOPING IS, ALL THE SMOKE AND AROMA OF THIS IS GONNA WAFT UP INTO THE TREE WHERE I'M SLEEPING. MORNING. WELL, THE SUN'S UP. I'VE GOT A FIRE GOING, TRYING TO GET WARM BECAUSE IT WAS COLD LAST NIGHT, AND ALL IN ALL, I DIDN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF GREAT NIGHT -- PARTLY BECAUSE IT WAS COLD, BUT PARTLY BECAUSE THE BABOONS WERE SCURRYING AROUND ALL THROUGH THE TREES. BUT THE GOOD THING ABOUT THE BABOONS IS THAT THEY ACT AS AN EARLY-WARNING SYSTEM. IF THERE'S ANY NASTY PREDATOR, THEY WOULD HAVE REALLY BEEN HOWLING LIKE CRAZY. BUT BEFORE I GO, WHAT I'M ALSO GONNA DO IS JUST PUT OUT A MARKER, SO IF ANYONE COMES ACROSS MY OLD CAMPSITE, THEY'LL KNOW WHICH WAY I'VE GONE. AND I CAN JUST USE SOME OF THE REMAINING LOGS FOR THIS AND JUST CLEAR THIS AREA. AND JUST PUT OUT A SIMPLE ARROW IN THE DIRECTION THAT I'M GONNA BE TRAVELING TODAY. OKAY, IT'S TIME TO GO. PUT THIS OUT. YOUR BEST BET IS TO FOLLOW A RIVER UPSTREAM. ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD, YOU'D HEAD DOWNSTREAM TO FIND PEOPLE. BUT HERE AFRICA, ENTIRE RIVERS CAN JUST DISAPPEAR UNDERGROUND, SO I'M GOING UP, TOWARDS THE FERTILE SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN. [ HIPPOPOTAMUSES GRUNTING ] THAT SOUND IS UNMISTAKABLE -- HIPPOS. THEY'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST KILLERS IN AFRICA. [ HIPPOPOTAMUSES GRUNTING ] >> I'M IN NORTHERN KENYA, SHOWING HOW TO SURVIVE, BUT IN FRONT OF ME IS ONE OF THE DEADLIEST ANIMALS IN ALL OF AFRICA. IF I GOT IN THIS RIVER HERE AND TRIED TO CROSS THIS, THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I'D DIE. AND THE REASON IS THOSE HIPPOS. THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY DANGEROUS. THE MALES ARE SO TERRITORIAL, AND THE FEMALES ARE VERY PROTECTIVE OF THEIR YOUNG. AND THE WORST PLACE YOU CAN BE IS BETWEEN A HIPPO AND THE WATER. THERE WAS AN AUSTRALIAN LADY WHO WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN A HIPPO AND THE WATER. AND THE HIPPO JUST WENT BERSERK, CHARGED AT HER, FLIPPED HER IN THE AIR, TRAMPLED HER, AND BIT HER TO DEATH. [ GRUNTING CONTINUES ] AND THAT'S JUST A WARNING TO ME TO STAY BACK. THAT'S THEIR FIRST WARNING. [ GRUNTING CONTINUES ] HALF A MILE UPSTREAM, THINGS LOOK A BIT MORE PROMISING. THIS ACTUALLY ISN'T A BAD PLACE FOR ME TO CROSS. IT'S QUITE FAST-FLOWING, AND IT'S QUITE SHALLOW. IT'S RARE TO FIND HIPPOS IN SHALLOW WATER LIKE THIS. HIPPOS PREFER DEEPER, CALMER WATER TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR MASSIVE BODY WEIGHT. THIS STUFF IS JUST SO, SO SLIPPY. TAKE IT EASY, GUYS, HERE. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] OKAY. I'M ACROSS. I'M FOLLOWING THE RIVER UP THE LOWER SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN, AND ALL AROUND ME ARE REMINDERS THAT I'M IN THE MIDST OF A CONSTANT LIFE-OR-DEATH STRUGGLE. IT MIGHT SEEM A LOT OF EFFORT, BUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY OF FOLLOWING THE RIVER IS TO GET IN IT. AND THIS MOUNTAIN WATER IS TOO COLD AND FAST FOR HIPPOS. BUT WHAT THERE ARE, ARE LEOPARDS, AND PROBABLY WHY I'M BETTER OFF STICKING IN THIS STREAM THAN TRYING TO DO BATTLE WITH THESE STEEP RAVINES AND FORESTS. I CAN TELL I'M GETTING HIGHER UP NOW, JUST 'CAUSE IT'S FREEZING COLD. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] THE GRADIENT IS INCREASING, AND THAT MEANS STEEP WATERFALLS. BUT IT'S STILL EASIER FOR ME TO CLIMB THEM THAN LEAVE THE RIVER AND CLIMB SOME OF THE SHEER PRECIPICES AROUND THEM. EVEN THOUGH THIS WATERFALL IS QUITE COLD, CLIMBING IT WAS SO MUCH FUN. AND HAVING FUN IS A KEY PART OF KEEPING YOUR MORALE UP. IT WILL SOON BE DUSK, AND AS THE AIR TEMPERATURE DROPS, THERE'S A REAL RISK OF HYPOTHERMIA. THIS WATER IS JUST SO, SO COLD, AND I'M FIGHTING TO TRY AND KEEP THE TOP HALF OF ME AT LEAST DRY, BECAUSE REALISTICALLY, IN WATER THIS COLD, I WOULDN'T LAST LONG UP TO MY NECK. THESE FIXED LINES GOING STRAIGHT UP -- STRAIGHT OFF SOMETHING. IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A CABLE OR A PULLEY. YEAH, LOOK, YOU CAN EVEN SEE, LIKE, A BASKET. IT'S PROBABLY A WAY THE LOCAL FARMERS SEND FEED ACROSS THESE RAVINES, AND THE ROPES LOOK LIKE PART OF THE PULLEY SYSTEM THAT HAS COME ADRIFT. BUT I JUST NEED TO FIND OUT WHETHER THIS ROPE IS STRONG ENOUGH. WELL... THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO TEST IT. I'M JUST GOING FOR IT. [ EXHALING SHARPLY ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IT'S WELL OVER 100 FEET TO THE TOP OF THIS RAVINE, AND THE ONLY WAY TO CLIMB UP THESE ROPES IS THE HARD WAY, HAND OVER HAND. THERE'S NOT MUCH TECHNIQUE OR FINESSE HERE. IT JUST TAKES STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, AND NEVER LOOK DOWN. OHH. [ PANTING ] I THINK WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT AFRICA IS THAT IT'S A PLACE THAT'S FULL OF LIFE, THAT'S LOCKED IN A STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL. AND FOR SOME CREATURES TO LIVE, OTHERS MUST DIE, BUT THE KEY TO STAYING ALIVE OUT HERE IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ANIMALS AND, LIKE OUR COMMON ANCESTORS, USE OUR BRAINS TO KEEP US ON TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN.
