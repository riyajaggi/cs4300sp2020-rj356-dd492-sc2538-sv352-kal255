 Man vs. Wild (2006â€“2020): Season 1, Episode 13 - Kimberley, Australia - full transcript 
 More than 5 million visitors come to Australia's outback every year -- but hundreds need rescuing in this land of extreme heat, snake bites and cyclones. Host Bear Grylls travels to Australia's Kimberley region, roughly the size of California and a mixture of huge scrub deserts, dry riverbeds and red sandstone cliffs full of deep gorges. Bear puts himself in the position of a lost tourist to demonstrate how to prevent sunstroke, find bush tucker...and explain why drinking your own urine could save your life. He also identifies what you can eat in the outback, including a crucifix spider. During his journey, Bear builds a shelter in the middle of a lightning storm and confronts Australia's deadly saltwater crocodiles.

 >> I'M BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES, I'VE CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF EVEREST, AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN AUSTRALIA'S OUTBACK -- A VAST WILDERNESS. 5 MILLION VISITORS COME HERE EVERY YEAR TO SEE THESE RUGGED LANDS.

 HUNDREDS NEED RESCUING. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE SKILLS NEEDED TO SURVIVE OUT HERE. I'M FLYING OVER WESTERN AUSTRALIA IN A REGION CALLED THE KIMBERLEY. IT'S AN AREA THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA, YET ONLY 30,000 PEOPLE LIVE HERE, AND MOST OF THOSE BY THE COAST. THIS PLACE IS WILD. THE OUTBACK HAS AN EXTREME CLIMATE. FOR EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR, IT

 NEVER RAINS, AND IT CAN GET UP TO 130 DEGREES. NOW IT'S THE WET SEASON, AND IT'S EVEN TOUGHER. HUMIDITY IS OFTEN 100%, WHICH MAKES THE TEMPERATURES FEEL EVEN MORE UNBEARABLE. THE AUSSIES CALL IT THE SUICIDE SEASON. OF THE THOUSANDS OF HARD-CORE TOURISTS WHO COME HERE, 40 LOSE THEIR LIVES EVERY YEAR TO HEAT, SNAKES, AND CYCLONES. THEY SAY THAT IF YOU GET LOST OUT HERE WITH NO SURVIVAL SKILLS, THERE'S A 75% CHANCE YOU'LL DIE. BUT I'M GOING TO SHOW HOW YOU CAN SURVIVE IN THIS HARSHEST OF ENVIRONMENTS. IF NEEDED, I'LL GET SOME HELP FROM LOCAL EXPERTS, AND A CAMERA CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. WHEW! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IT IS SUDDENLY JUST SO HOT. IT WAS QUITE NICE AND COOL IN THE BREEZE OF LIKE 100-MILE-AN-HOUR SLIPSTREAM. BUT SUDDENLY YOU REALIZE IT IS VERY, VERY HOT. AND IT'S ALSO JUST HUGE. LOOK AT THIS. FIRST THING -- FIND A VANTAGE POINT TO SEE WHERE YOU ARE. THE KIMBERLEY MAY BE THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA, BUT THIS AREA OF THE OUTBACK HAS ONLY ONE HIGHWAY ACROSS IT. FOR MILLENNIA, THIS LAND HAS BEEN COMPLETELY UNDEVELOPED, AND THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE WERE AUSTRALIA'S FAMOUS BUSHMEN -- THE ABORIGINES. IT'S THEIR SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT I'LL USE TO SHOW YOU HOW TO SURVIVE IN THIS WILD LANDSCAPE. WOW! LOOK AT THAT. WHOO! AND THIS VAST LANDSCAPE IS TYPICAL OF THE OUTBACK IN NORTHERN AUSTRALIA. IT'S A MIXTURE OF HUGE SCRUB DESERTS, DRY RIVERBEDS, AND RED SANDSTONE CLIFFS FULL OF DEEP GORGES. IT MUST BE OVER 100 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. IT'S DEVASTATINGLY HOT HERE. BUT, FIRST, GET YOUR BEARINGS. THERE'S A MAJOR HIGHWAY THAT RUNS THROUGH THE SOUTH OF HERE, ABOUT 150 MILES AWAY. BUT MUCH CLOSER AND TO THE NORTHWEST, I KNOW, ALSO, THERE ARE A FEW SMALL TOWNS, AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF DIRT TRACKS. BUT, FIRST OF ALL, I'VE GOT TO WORK OUT WHICH WAY IS NORTHWEST, AND WHAT I CAN DO IS USE THE SUN AND MY WATCH. AND THE TECHNIQUE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE IS YOU POINT 12:00 AT THE SUN, AND HALFWAY BETWEEN THERE AND THE HOUR HAND IS NORTH. SO, THAT'S NORTH, AND THAT'S NORTHWEST. SO, HEAD NORTHWEST UNTIL YOU FIND A RIVER, WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO THE COAST. BUT BEFORE HEADING OUT INTO THE GREAT OUTBACK, HERE'S A LITTLE TRICK. I'M GONNA SPREAD MY PARACHUTE OUT AS A MARKER SO IT'S VISIBLE FROM THE AIR, AND I'LL LEAVE AN ARROW POINTING TOWARDS THE DIRECTION THAT I'VE GONE. THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ALL RIGHT PLACE TO CLIMB DOWN. THE ONLY THING IS, CLIMBING LIKE THIS, WHEN YOU'RE UNROPED AND YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, IS PROBABLY THE MOST UNFORGIVING THING YOU CAN DO, AND IT JUST MEANS YOU'VE GOT TO GET EVERY SINGLE MOVE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND ONE GOOD TIP TO CONSERVE YOUR ENERGY, WHEN YOU'RE CLIMBING, YOU TRY AND KEEP YOUR HANDS AND YOUR ARMS AT SHOULDER HEIGHT. AS SOON AS THEY START GOING UP, ALL THE BLOOD DRAINS OUT OF THEM, AND YOU FATIGUE MUCH QUICKER. BEEN GOING JUST LITERALLY FIVE MINUTES. I'M JUST DRENCHED IN SWEAT ALREADY. [ EXHALES ] IT'S 150 FOOT TO THE BOTTOM, BUT WITH ROCKS AS FLAKY AS THIS, YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO WATCH YOUR FOOTING. THERE WAS AN AMERICAN TOURIST OUT HERE IN 2005, AND HE ACTUALLY SLIPPED AND THEN FELL ABOUT 40 FOOT DOWN ROCK FACES NOT DISSIMILAR TO THIS. BUT HE ACTUALLY SURVIVED -- SURVIVED THAT FALL. BUT THEN PROBABLY WHAT HE DID WAS PANIC, AND IT'S THEN THAT HE SLIPPED AND HE FELL, AND THIS TIME HE WAS KILLED. I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY HOT AT THE TOP OF THESE CLIFFS, BUT WHAT I HAD UP THERE AT LEAST WAS, YOU KNOW, A BIT OF A BREEZE. BUT DOWN HERE, I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S JUST BOILING, BOILING. AND IT'S LIKE I'M NOW ENTERING THESE HOT PLAINS, AND IT FEELS A BIT LIKE...I'M OUT OF THE FURNACE BUT DEFINITELY ENTERING THE FIRE. DOWN HERE, IT'S UNBEARABLY HUMID. IT MAY LOOK GREEN AND LUSH, BUT IT ISN'T. THE HUMIDITY IS 100%, WHICH MAKES THE TEMPERATURE FEEL MORE LIKE 150 DEGREES. GOD, THE SUN IS JUST SO POWERFUL. THE DANGER OF HIGH HUMIDITY IS THAT SWEAT CAN NO LONGER EVAPORATE AND COOL YOU DOWN BECAUSE THE AIR IS ALREADY FULLY SATURATED WITH MOISTURE. THAT MAKES HEATSTROKE EVEN MORE LIKELY. TEMPERATURES IN THE OUTBACK OF AUSTRALIA HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO REACH UP TO 57 DEGREES CELSIUS. THAT'S OVER 130 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. IT'S UNBELIEVABLY HOT. AND THE SEARCH-AND RESCUE GUYS SAY THAT IF SOMEONE IS DROPPED INTO THE MIDDLE OF THAT WITH NOTHING -- NO WATER -- WITHIN THREE HOURS, THEY'D BE DEAD. AND THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF YOU TO KEEP COOL IS YOUR HEAD. YOU HAVE TO REDUCE THE RISK OF OVERHEATING. YOU COULD USE YOUR T-SHIRT, BUT THEN THE SUN WOULD SEAR YOUR BODY. SO, IF YOU'RE A GUY, ALL YOU'VE GOT LEFT ARE YOUR BOXER SHORTS. HAT ON, SOME SORT OF PROTECTION. I'M READY TO GO. YOUR HEAD IS THE MOST VULNERABLE PART OF YOUR BODY, AND A HAT WILL KEEP YOU COOLER, BUT THE BIG PROBLEM WILL BE WATER. YOU MIGHT NEED TO RESORT TO EXTREME MEASURES TO SURVIVE. THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS TO DRINK MY OWN PEE. >> I'M IN THE KIMBERLEY IN NORTH AUSTRALIA. I'M SHOWING HOW TO SURVIVE IN THIS HOSTILE WILDERNESS. YOU'LL NEED WATER, BUT IF THERE ISN'T ANY, YOU CAN DRINK YOUR OWN PEE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE, AND I'M EXPECTING IT TO BE PRETTY HORRIBLE, BUT I NEED TO KEEP THOSE FLUIDS GOING IN. IT MAY SEEM DISGUSTING, BUT YOUR OWN URINE IS SAFE TO DRINK. [ URINE FLOWING INTO BOTTLE ] [ SIGHING ] AND IF I JUST PEED ON THE GROUND, THAT'S ALL THOSE FLUIDS WASTED. UGH. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] [ GULPS ] [ SIGHING ] GAH, THERE'S NO GETTING AWAY FROM IT. PBHT. THAT REALLY IS PRETTY HORRIBLE. IT'S, LIKE, WARM, AND IT'S SALTY [SIGHS] ...AND NOT -- [Chuckling] NOT MY FAVORITE. [ GULPS ] [ SIGHS ] BUT I'VE GOT ABOUT A QUARTER OF A BOTTLE NOW FOR LATER, AS WELL. UGH. URINE IS ACTUALLY 95% WATER, AND IT'S STERILE WHEN FRESH. BUT ONLY DRINK IT WHEN YOU'RE HYDRATED, AND DRINK IT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, AS IT'S A BREEDING GROUND FOR BACTERIA. THE PEOPLE WHO STAND THE BEST CHANCE OF SURVIVAL ARE THE ONES PREPARED TO PUSH THE LIMITS. IN 2006, THREE MEXICAN FISHERMEN WERE RESCUED AFTER A 9-MONTH ORDEAL ADRIFT ON THE PACIFIC OCEAN. THEY DRANK TURTLE BLOOD AND THEIR OWN URINE. IT'S ONLY BECAUSE THEY WERE PREPARED TO GO TO THESE EXTREMES THAT THEY ARE ALIVE TODAY. BUT URINE ALONE IS NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH IN THIS HEAT. YOU'VE GOT TO FIND WATER, AND FAST. JUST AT REST, YOU SHOULD BE DRINKING 2% OF YOUR BODY WEIGHT IN WATER EVERY DAY. THAT MEANS ABOUT 1 1/2 LITERS -- MINIMUM. BUT IN THESE CONDITIONS, YOU'LL NEED THAT MUCH JUST EVERY HOUR. [ SIGHS ] LOOK AT THE SCALE OF THIS. THE COMBINATION OF SEARING HEAT AND HIGH HUMIDITY WILL TAKE THEIR TOLL. [ SIGHS ] YOUR SWEAT WON'T COOL YOU DOWN, AND IF YOU CAN'T FIND ENOUGH FLUIDS IN THIS HEAT, YOU'LL DIE. I'M WALKING THROUGH THESE BAOBAB TREES NOW, AND THESE ARE REALLY TYPICAL OF THIS WHOLE KIMBERLEY REGION, BUT WHAT THEY DO FOR ME IS OFFER ME A LITTLE BIT OF THIS PRECIOUS SHADE. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] FINDING SHADE LIKE THIS CAN BE A LIFESAVER, AS IT'S UP TO 30 DEGREES COOLER THAN WHEN YOU'RE IN THE SUN. THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HOW TO COPE BEST IN THIS ENVIRONMENT, THOUGH, ARE THE NATIVE AUSTRALIANS, THE ABORIGINES. THE ABORIGINES HAVE A VERY DISTINCT ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE LAND, AND THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES AS OWNERS OF THE LAND -- RATHER THAT THE LAND OWNS THEM, AS IF THEY'RE KIND OF CUSTODIANS OF IT. AND IT'S THIS SORT OF RESPECT AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IS SO VITAL FOR STAYING ALIVE IN THIS SORT OF HARSH ENVIRONMENT. AS THE AFTERNOON AND THE CLOUDS START TO ROLL IN, THE SUN'S HEAT IS BEGINNING TO COOL OFF A LITTLE. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] HEAR THAT? THUNDER. IT'S AMAZING, YOU KNOW -- SUN. I TELL YOU, IT'S GONNA BE RAIN WITHIN A FEW HOURS. IT'S ALL MOVING THIS WAY. OUT HERE IN THE WET SEASON, THE INTENSE HUMIDITY AND THE TROPICAL CYCLONES CAN LEAD TO SUDDEN THUNDERSTORMS. IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A CAMPFIRE FOR THE NIGHT, YOU'VE GOT TO COLLECT SOME TINDER NOW WHILE IT'S DRY. A LOT OF THE BUSHES AROUND HERE ARE THESE KAPOK BUSHES, AND LOOK AND TELL THAT JUST FROM THESE LEAVES. THEY'RE SOFT, THEY'RE FURRY, AND THEY'RE KIND OF SHAPED LIKE A MAPLE LEAF, AS WELL. BUT WHAT I AM AFTER IS THE SEED PODS THAT GROW ON THEM. HERE YOU GO. YEAH, LOOK. PULL THIS DOWN. AND LOOK. YOU SEE THESE ONES HERE? HERE YOU GO. PULL THIS OFF. AND JUST INSIDE, THERE'S, LIKE, THIS COTTON WOOL, BUT THIS STUFF IS GREAT FOR TINDER, FOR MAKING A FIRE. SO I'M GONNA JUST COLLECT A FEW OF THESE, AND THAT WILL REALLY HELP ME. THE KAPOK SHELLS NOT ONLY PROTECT THE SEEDS BUT ALSO HELP KEEP THAT COTTON WOOL TINDER DRY. THE NORTH OF AUSTRALIA IS ONE OF THE MOST LIGHTNING-PRONE AREAS ON EARTH. SOME STORMS HAVE PRODUCED OVER 1,500 LIGHTNING FLASHES IN JUST A FEW HOURS. YOU CAN SEE THOSE DARK CLOUDS AND OVER HERE THE BLUE STUFF THAT HAS JUST MOVED, AND THAT IS ALL HEADING MY WAY. IF THE WEATHER CLOSES IN LIKE THIS, YOU'LL NEED SOME SORT OF SHELTER. YEAH, I NEED TO GET OFF THIS ROCK NOW AND MAKE CAMP. WITH STORMS COME RAIN, AND IN THE KIMBERLEY ALMOST 3 FOOT OF RAIN HAS BEEN KNOWN TO FALL IN ONLY NINE HOURS, AND THAT COULD LEAD TO TREACHEROUS FLASH FLOODS. AND I FEEL THAT WIND BLOWING STRAIGHT TOWARDS ME, AND, YEAH, IT'S REALLY STARTING TO POUR NOW. THE BAD WEATHER IS ABOUT TO HIT ME. I'VE GOT MINUTES UNTIL THE DELUGE BEGINS. EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT STAYING OUT HERE TONIGHT, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW THE ABORIGINES WOULD BUILD SHELTER AGAINST THIS SORT OF RAIN. OKAY, WHAT I CAN DO HERE IS BUILD A BIT OF A BED STRAIGHT ACROSS FROM HERE -- ONE BRACE HERE, ONE ONTO THIS LEDGE. AND THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO WHEN IT'S A TORRENTIAL THUNDERSTORM IS JUST BE ON THE GROUND, BECAUSE ALL OF THIS COULD JUST TURN TO WATER. SO FIRST THING IS, I NEED A PLATFORM. THE NATIVE AUSTRALIANS USE WHATEVER IS AT HAND TO DO THIS -- STICKS FOR THE FRAMEWORK, IVY FOR THE CORDAGE, AND BUNCHES OF LEAVES MAKE PERFECT ROOFING AND BEDDING. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] GOD, HEAR THAT? AND THIS IS GETTING CLOSER, AS WELL, THIS LIGHTNING. AND THAT IS WHERE THE 100% HUMIDITY HAS GONE STRAIGHT UP IN THE AIR, AND NOW IT IS POURING DOWN. AND THIS IS THE WET SEASON, KIMBERLEY, NORTHERN AUSTRALIA! THAT'S WHY I WAS BUILDING A BED. THIS, FIVE MINUTES AGO, WAS COMPLETELY DRY. NOW, LOOK, NOW, A FOOT OF WATER. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE AMAZING THING IS? TOMORROW IT WILL BE ALL BONE-DRY AGAIN BY LUNCHTIME. AND LOOK AT THAT. YOU SEE THAT? JUST POURING OFF THIS SANDY OUTCROP. IT MIGHT WELL JUST STOP RAINING IN FIVE MINUTES' TIME. SO I WANT TO FILL THIS UP. THIS IS JUST LIKE MANNA FROM HEAVEN. WHOO! THAT IS SO NICE. COME ON, RAIN! I'M HYDRATED. AGAIN, I'VE EVEN HAD A BIT OF A WASH. BUT BEING DRENCHED IN THE NIGHT IS NO FUN, SO MAKE SURE YOU BUILD YOUR SHELTER BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN. BUT A MUCH BIGGER DANGER OUT HERE IS LIGHTNING. AND IN AUSTRALIA, LIGHTNING STRIKES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 10 DEATHS A YEAR, AND THIS STORM IS GETTING CLOSER. >> I'M IN THE KIMBERLEY IN NORTH AUSTRALIA. IT'S THE WET SEASON, A THUNDERSTORM IS RAGING, AND MORE RAIN IS PROBABLY ON ITS WAY. I'M MAKING MY ROOF AT AN ANGLE TO HELP THE RAIN RUN OFF. I'VE PUT UP A BASIC FRAME MADE FROM THIN BRANCHES, AND I'M TYING IT ALL TOGETHER WITH VINES. OKAY, NOW I JUST NEED AS MUCH GREEN FOLIAGE I CAN, JUST TO COVER THIS. AND THAT'S GONNA BE MY WATERPROOFING. I'M USING EUCALYPTUS LEAVES. THEY'RE PLENTIFUL IN THE OUTBACK, AND THEY MAKE EXCELLENT THATCH. AND WHAT I CAN ALSO DO IS USE SOME OF THIS SMALLER, SOFTER STUFF AS A BIT OF A SPRINGY MATTRESS. LOOK AT THAT. THAT IS GONNA BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THAT. ALL I NOW NEED IS A FIRE TO GET THESE CLOTHES DRY. AND THE KAPOK-TREE SHELLS HAVE KEPT MY TINDER DRY. GOT TINDER, SOME KINDLING, AND SOME WOOD. AND THEN WHAT I'M GONNA USE TO LIGHT THE FIRE IS THIS STRIKER AND THIS FLINT. AND FLINT IS AN ANCIENT WAY OF LIGHTING FIRES. ALL THIS IS, IS A MODERN WAY OF DOING IT. AND I STRIKE THE STEEL ALONG THE FLINT LIKE THAT, AND IT CREATES THAT SPARK. AND THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS IS THAT WILL EVEN GO WHEN IT'S SOAKING WET. PUT THE FLINT RIGHT DOWN LOW, AND AS I STRIKE IT, I'M BLASTING ALL THAT SPARK STRAIGHT INTO IT. AND, LOOK, FIRST TIME. AND IT'S NOT SURPRISING. THE SPARK GIVEN OFF BY THE FLINT IS OVER 5,500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT, AND INCREDIBLY, IS BRIGHTER THAN THE SUN. ALL I NEED TO DO NOW IS GENTLY COAX IT. I THINK THE FEELING IS, WHEN IT SUDDENLY RAINS, IS IT BRINGS -- BRINGS OUT FRESH HOPE, YOU KNOW? AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE TIMES WHERE IT'S JUST SO DRY AND SO HOT, YOU THINK, "HOW IS IT POSSIBLE JUST TO SUSTAIN LIFE HERE?" AND THE ANSWER IS, WHEN IT RAINS. AND AUSTRALIA REALLY IS -- IT'S A PLACE OF EXTREMES. YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S HOT, IT'S ROASTING. WHEN IT RAINS, IT POURS, AND WHEN IT'S BEAUTIFUL, IT REALLY IS SPECTACULAR. IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY IN THE KIMBERLEY, YOU CAN EXPECT 125-DEGREE HEAT AND ENERGY-SAPPING HUMIDITY. BUT EVEN IN THIS WILDERNESS, THERE'S FOOD. NOW, THIS IS A ROCK FIG TREE. LOOK AT THAT. I CAN TELL THIS JUST BECAUSE IT HAS THIS VERY DISTINCT GRAY BARK. AND THEY OFTEN CLING TO THE SIDE OF JUST LITTLE CLIFFS, JUST LIKE THIS. AND, ACTUALLY, IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEAVES, THEY'RE OVAL-SHAPED. AND ALSO THEY'RE FURRY, AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THAT FUR STOPS THEM LOSING A LOT OF THEIR PRECIOUS MOISTURE. PROBLEM IS, ALL THE FRUITS ARE UP THERE. BUT CLIMBING UP TO GET THE FRUITS IS A RISK. THIS SANDSTONE IS BRITTLE AND CAN BE GREASY WHEN IT'S WET. SO I'M GONNA USE THE ROOTS AS HANDHOLDS TO HELP ME. THE ROOTS GO DEEP INTO THE CLIFF, SO THEY SHOULD BE STRONG AND SAFE. OKAY. THESE ARE THE GUYS I'M AFTER. THERE WE GO. AND LET US PLUCK ONE OF THESE OFF. ALL OF THIS FRUIT IS EDIBLE. IT'S NOT RIPE, BUT IT'S EDIBLE. AND IF YOU OPEN IT UP, SEE ALL OF THOSE FIG SEEDS INSIDE? AND... ALL OF THOSE ARE REALLY GOOD VITAMIN "C." IT'S PRETTY TASTELESS. IT'S LIKE KIND OF CHEWING ON CARDBOARD, BUT I KNOW IT'S GOOD. I WANT TO COLLECT A LOAD OF THESE, STICK THEM IN MY POCKET, AS MANY AS I CAN. TWO MORE FOR LUCK. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] FINDING YOUR WAY ACROSS THIS VAST LANDSCAPE IS DIFFICULT WITH SO FEW LANDMARKS TO HELP. THE NATIVE AUSTRALIANS HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE METHOD OF NAVIGATION. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT ABORIGINES ARE, IN MANY WAYS, THE ULTIMATE SURVIVORS IN THE OUTBACK IS THAT THEY USE THESE SONGS THAT ARE PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION AS A WAY OF NAVIGATING THROUGH THIS WILDERNESS. AND WHAT THESE SONGS DO IS THEY ACT AS, LIKE -- IT'S LIKE A SINGING MAP, YOU KNOW, DIRECTING THEM BETWEEN HUNTING GROUNDS, WATER HOLES, AND GOOD PLACES TO SHELTER. BUT I DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT SORT OF HISTORY. AND THAT MEANS STICKING TO MY NORTHWEST BEARING AND HOPING THAT I'LL EVENTUALLY FIND CIVILIZATION. FOOD IS HARD TO FIND IN THIS WILDERNESS, BUT YOU'LL NEED TO KEEP LOOKING, OR YOU'LL JUST RUN OUT OF ENERGY. [ GULPS, SIGHS ] THERE'S A SPIDER THERE, A CRUCIFIX SPIDER, AND THEY'RE CALLED THESE JUST FROM THE SHAPE, WHERE THEY SIT IN THEIR PREY, AND THAT CROSSLIKE CRUCIFIX SHAPE, AND THEN ALL THE WEB AROUND IT. AND THE WEB THEY SPIN IS ACTUALLY AMAZING. IT'S ACTUALLY 50 TIMES STRONGER THAN STEEL. AND I WAS TAUGHT IN THE MILITARY, YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE SPIDERS' WEBS TO HELP WITH WOUNDS. AND WHAT YOU DO, YOU COLLECT IT ALL UP, BUNCH IT UP, PUT IT IN THE WOUND, AND IT WILL HELP COAGULATE THE BLOOD. IT ACTS AS, LIKE, A FIELD DRESSING. BUT THIS SPIDER HERE, IT DOES HAVE SOME POISON IN IT, BUT NOT ENOUGH REALLY TO HARM YOU. IT MIGHT JUST GIVE A LITTLE NIP. AND SO MUCH OF SURVIVAL IS ABOUT OPPORTUNISTIC HUNTING, AND THIS IS EDIBLE. HERE WE GO. AND GRAB HIM HERE, SQUEEZE HIS HEAD, AND THEN... PUT HIM IN. UGH! JUST TASTES OF KIND OF GUTS AND PUS AND BRAIN. SPIDERS AND OTHER INSECTS ARE ALWAYS A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY ENOUGH. AND ON TOP OF THAT, THE RAINWATER FROM THE STORM HAS DRIED UP. IN THIS HEAT, YOU HAVE TO FIND SOMETHING TO DRINK. BUT HERE THERE'S NONE TO BE FOUND. COMING OFF THESE HILLS IS NOT AS EASY AS I THOUGHT. AND THERE'S OBSTACLES EVERYWHERE YOU TURN. AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO CROSS THIS. AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY DANGER YOU'LL FACE IN THIS WILDERNESS. AHEAD ARE SNAKES AND, THE MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL, AUSTRALIA'S LETHAL CROCODILES. >> I'M IN THE SEARING HEAT AND HUMIDITY OF AUSTRALIA'S OUTBACK. WATER IS SCARCE, AND THE TERRITORY IS UNFORGIVING. SO IS THIS 40-FOOT DROP. THIS GORGE ISN'T LOOKING TOO GREAT. LET'S HAVE A LOOK. YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT -- PROBABLY ABOUT 40 FOOT DOWN HERE, BUT ACTUALLY THIS TREE DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD. AND IF I COULD JUST REACH THAT MAIN TRUNK, I MIGHT WELL BE ABLE TO JUST, LIKE, MONKEY DOWN IT. AND ACTUALLY THERE WAS A HIKER A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHO GOT LOST, AND HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE TOP OF A GORGE LIKE THIS, AND HIS ONLY WAY OUT WAS TO GO DOWN A TREE. AND HE WENT FOR IT, AND HE MANAGED IT, AND HE GOT OUT. IT'S A RISKY CLIMB, SO I'M ROPING UP JUST IN CASE. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] OKAY, I'VE JUST GOT TO GET MY LEG AROUND THIS TREE TRUNK. [ GRUNTING ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO HERE IS REALLY GRIP JUST WITH MY THIGHS AND LET THEM TAKE THE STRAIN AND JUST BALANCE WITH MY ARMS AND TRY AND PROTECT MY FAMILY JEWELS. WOW. WHOA! [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] WOW! WHOA! OHHH. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] THERE'S WATER AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS GORGE, BUT YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE IT'S DRINKABLE. YOU HAVE TO FIND OUT FIRST WHERE IT HAS COME FROM. YOU'LL ONLY BE TOTALLY SAFE IF IT COMES FROM AN UNDERGROUND SPRING. WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO IS JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THE STREAM UP HERE TO FIND WHERE IT STOPS. YEAH, IT'S STILL GOING HERE. AND, YEAH, LOOK, IT'S DRY UP THERE, AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN IT RAINS, IT WILL POUR DOWN HERE. WHEN IT'S DRY LIKE NOW, YOU'LL SEE THIS, LIKE, NATURAL SPRING. AND THIS -- YEAH, THIS IS THE SOURCE OF IT. AND IF I DIG DOWN INTO THIS... HOWEVER MUCH WATER I TAKE OUT, IT'S JUST GONNA KEEP REFILLING. THIS SPRINGWATER HAS FILTERED THROUGH THE ROCKS TO EMERGE AS CLEAN WATER. THAT MEANS IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO BE BOILED. OHHH. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS THAT ALL THIS WATER JUST GETS CLEANED NATURALLY AS IT FILTERS THROUGH ALL THE ROCK AND THE SAND. AND IT'S 100% SAFE, THIS STUFF, TO DRINK. AND THE GREAT THING IS, HOWEVER MUCH OF IT THAT I DO DRINK, THIS THING IS JUST GONNA KEEP WELLING UP AND FILLING UP. [ SIGHS ] OKAY. YOU SHOULD KEEP FOLLOWING A RIVER LIKE THIS DOWNSTREAM. IT'LL PROBABLY LEAD TO A BIGGER RIVER, THEN THE COAST. WALKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIG PART OF ABORIGINAL CULTURE, AND FOR THEM, IT'S ABOUT EXPERIENCING THE LANDSCAPE AND LEARNING TO LIVE WITH NATURE. AND FOR ME, I THINK, SO MANY OF MY EARLY CLIMBING EXPEDITIONS WERE SIMILAR, YOU KNOW? IT'S ABOUT PUSHING MY OWN BOUNDARIES AND, THROUGH THAT, FINDING MY SENSE OF IDENTITY. WOW! LOOK AT THAT! WHOO! AFTER THE HOT PLAINS, COMING ACROSS A RIVER LIKE THIS WILL REALLY LIFT YOUR SPIRITS. WHAA! OH. I JOKE NOT WHEN I SAY IT IS SEARINGLY HOT HERE, AND THIS WATER IS JUST GODSENT. OHHH. OHH! ABORIGINES BELIEVE THAT THE RAINBOW SERPENT MADE THE RIVERS AS HE TRAVELED ACROSS THE LAND. AND THAT SERPENT IS A SYMBOL FOR BOTH THE CREATIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE FORCES OF NATURE. THESE RIVER GORGES ARE TESTIMONY TO THAT POWER. ALL AROUND ME ARE SIGNS OF FLASH FLOODS AND DEBRIS. NOW IN THE WET SEASON, THE RISKS OF THESE FLOODS ARE EVEN HIGHER. WHERE THERE IS WATER, THERE IS LIFE, AND NOT ALL OF IT IS FRIENDLY. WHAA! LOOK AT THIS! >> I'M IN THE BAKING HEAT OF THE KIMBERLEY IN NORTH AUSTRALIA. OUT HERE, OVER 3,000 PEOPLE EACH YEAR GET BITTEN BY SNAKES. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU WHAT TO DO IF YOU COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH ONE. IT'S AN OLIVE PYTHON. LET'S JUST GET HIM OUT OF HERE. THERE YOU COME, THERE YOU COME. WE JUST LEAVE HIS HEAD ON THE GROUND. THEY'RE ALWAYS CALMEST WHEN THEY GOT THEIR HEAD ON THE GROUND LIKE THAT, BUT THIS IS -- YEAH, THIS IS A PRETTY COMMON SNAKE IN AUSTRALIA. AND HERE WE GO. WE'LL JUST GET HIS HEAD. YEAH, HE'LL PROBABLY LIVE OFF, LIKE, RODENTS, SKINKS, EVEN OTHER -- ACTUALLY, OTHER SMALL SNAKES. AND ONE THING THERE ARE NO SHORTAGE OF IN AUSTRALIA ARE SNAKES. IN FACT, I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE 21 OF THE 25 MOST POISONOUS SNAKES IN THE WORLD ARE ACTUALLY IN AUSTRALIA. THE ABORIGINES HAVE ALWAYS LIVED IN HARMONY WITH THE LAND, ONLY TAKING WHAT NATURE CAN MAINTAIN. AND TODAY THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE IN AUSTRALIA ALLOWED TO KILL INDIGENOUS SPECIES. THEY WOULD CARRY THEIR LIVE PREY UNTIL THEY NEEDED TO EAT IT. BUT AS I'M NOT A NATIVE AUSTRALIAN, I'M GONNA LET THIS SNAKE GO. AS IT'S SO HUMID, I DON'T NEED A SHELTER TONIGHT. I'LL JUST SLEEP UNDER THE STARS. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] IT'S KIND OF HARD TO SLEEP AT THE MOMENT JUST BECAUSE I'M STILL JUST POURING IN SWEAT, IT'S SO HUMID. BUT IT HAS JUST GIVEN ME TIME JUST TO SIT AND LOOK AROUND AND LISTEN. I CAN HEAR THE RIVER FLOWING. THERE'S A DISTANT THUNDERSTORM, SO I CAN HEAR THE ODD CRACK OF LIGHTNING OCCASIONALLY, AND IT JUST GIVES ME THAT TIME JUST TO GO ACTUALLY, "WOW, THIS IS SPECIAL." AND IT'S JUST, FOR ME, A REAL PRIVILEGE TO BE IN SOMEWHERE SO WILD BUT ALSO SO UNIQUE. AND THAT, FOR ME, KEEPS MY SPIRITS GOING. [ SNIFFLES ] DAWN HAS BROKEN OVER THE OUTBACK IN NORTH AUSTRALIA. AS SOON AS THE SUN COMES OVER THE HORIZON, I CAN FEEL ITS WARMING RAYS. THE TEMPERATURE IS ALREADY 90 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND RISING, BUT AT LEAST I'M NEAR WATER. IT'S TIME FOR AN EARLY-MORNING DIP. WHOO! BY FOLLOWING THIS RIVER DOWNSTREAM, YOU COULD REACH THE COAST. BUT THE DANGER, AS I HEAD DOWN, THIS RIVER IS GONNA GET WIDER, BIGGER, AND ALSO, AS IT GETS CLOSER TO THE SEA, CROCODILES. AND ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS FOR ME ARE THE SALTWATER ONES. AND SOON I START TO SEE CROCODILES. AND SOME OF THESE ARE MAN-EATERS. >> I'M IN THE AUSTRALIAN OUTBACK, CLOSE TO THE BANK OF A RIVER WHICH SHOULD RUN DOWN TO THE COAST. THIS IS CROCODILE TERRITORY. IN LIFE-OR-DEATH SITUATIONS, IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO SET YOURSELF A STRUCTURE TO WORK WITHIN -- YOU KNOW, LIKE A DISCIPLINE AND GOALS TO HAVE. THE WAY I'M WORKING, AT THE MOMENT, IS THE THING WE USED TO DO IN THE ARMY OF JUST, WHEN YOU'RE WALKING LONG DISTANCES, BREAKING IT DOWN AND MARCHING FOR LIKE AN HOUR AND THEN TAKING 10 MINUTES JUST TO SIT DOWN, REST, FIND SOME SHADE, BIT OF WATER, AND THEN ANOTHER HOUR, AND STICKING TO THIS TIMING RELIGIOUSLY. AND IT JUST HELPS BREAK THE DAY DOWN. AND WHAT BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO STOP THAN A FRUIT BUSH? WHAT I'M SITTING UNDER HERE IS A WALLAROO BUSH, AND I CAN TELL THAT JUST FROM THESE OVAL-SHAPED LEAVES WITH THESE YELLOW VEINS RUNNING THROUGH IT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE OF THESE WHITE BERRIES THAT THEY'VE GOT. AND THESE ARE EDIBLE. AND THEY'RE ALSO DELICIOUS. THEY SORT OF FEEL LIKE BLUEBERRIES WHEN THEY POP IN YOUR MOUTH, YOU KNOW? THEY'VE ALSO GOT THESE SEEDS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT BITTER, BUT YOU DON'T KIND OF NOTICE THAT, JUST BECAUSE THE REST OF IT IS SO SWEET. AND SO MUCH OF SURVIVAL ACTUALLY IS JUST ABOUT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF IT -- THINGS THAT GIVE YOU A LIFT AND KEEP YOU GOING. AND THESE BERRIES ARE JUST SO SWEET AND TASTY, AND ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU SMILE AND WILL HELP YOU KEEP MOVING IS A GOOD THING WHEN YOU'RE OUT IN THE WILD. [ THUNDER RUMBLES ] BUT AS THE LANDSCAPE ALTERS, THERE ARE NEW DANGERS. EVERYTHING IS JUST CHANGING NOW. LOOK, THE WEATHER IS GETTING WORSE. THE WIND IS PICKING UP, BUT ALSO, THIS RIVER IS REALLY WIDENING, WHICH MEANS IT'S PRIME CROCODILE TERRITORY. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF CROCODILES IN AUSTRALIA. SALTWATER CROCODILES ARE THE MAN-EATERS, AND THEY TEND TO STAY NEAR THE COAST. SO FAR, I'M ONLY SEEING FRESHWATER ONES, BUT EVEN THESE CAN ATTACK. HEY, LOOK, LOOK, THERE YOU GO. THERE'S A FRESHWATER CROCODILE, 20 METERS AWAY. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET UP A LITTLE BIT CLOSER. HE'S ONLY A SMALL ONE. KEEP AN EYE OUT AROUND, AS WELL. THERE YOU GO. LOOK, LOOK. THESE FRESHWATER CROCS ARE FAST. THEY CAN RUN UP TO 10 MILES AN HOUR IN SHORT BURSTS, SO YOU'VE GOT TO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE. SEE, WHAT THEY LIKE HERE IS ALL THESE SHALLOW POOLS THAT THEY'RE JUST BASKING IN. WE'VE GOT QUITE A LOT OF THESE POOLS AROUND US, GUYS. LET'S JUST KEEP MOVING. OKAY, THIS IS A MUCH SAFER DISTANCE TO BE. WE'RE ABOUT 50 METERS BACK NOW FROM THE BANK, BUT WE NEED TO KEEP THAT DISTANCE AND KEEP FOLLOWING THE RIVER THERE. FRESHIES ARE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED BY THEIR LONG, THIN SNOUTS. THERE'S ANOTHER. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE. FRESHIES TEND TO ATTACK IF CORNERED OR SURPRISED. I NEVER WANT TO FIND MYSELF BETWEEN A CROC AND THE RIVER. HERE, FURTHER DOWNSTREAM, YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO RUN INTO SALTWATER CROCODILES, AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR, THEY OFTEN HEAD UPSTREAM, AWAY FROM THEIR USUAL COASTAL HABITAT. IT'S THEIR BREEDING SEASON, AND THAT MAKES THEM EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE. OH! SEE THAT? LOOK. SALTWATER CROCODILE. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT FROM THIS DISTANCE. NOW, THESE GUYS ARE THE ONES YOU WANT TO WATCH OUT FOR. IF HE TOOK ME, HE'D DRAG ME INTO THE WATER, DEATH ROLL, AND THEN RIP ME APART. AND THE CHANCES OF SURVIVING A SALTWATER-CROCODILE ATTACK IN DEEP WATER ARE ALMOST NIL. AMAZING TO SEE SO CLOSE, BUT THIS MEANS THERE ARE SALTIES HERE. I DON'T WANT TO BE CLOSE TO THE RIVER. I'M GONNA MOVE BACK INLAND. COME ON, THEN. SALTIES HAVE BROAD, ROUND NOSES AND ARE CONSIDERED TO BE AUSTRALIA'S MOST DANGEROUS ANIMAL. THEY'RE CAPABLE OF BITING WITH A FORCE OF ONE TON PER SQUARE INCH, AND SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THAT'S EVEN STRONGER THAN THE TYRANNOSAURUS REX. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 60 UNPROVOKED ATTACKS IN AUSTRALIA EVERY YEAR. CROCODILES VERY RARELY MISS THEIR TARGETS. AND RECENTLY, THERE WAS A GUY CANOEING IN QUEENSLAND, AND A CROCODILE CAME UP UNDERNEATH HIM, TURNED HIM OVER, AND TOOK HIM. NEVER UNDERESTIMATE SALTWATER CROCODILES. THEY'RE ONE OF OUR PLANET'S MOST RUTHLESS AND EFFICIENT KILLERS. NOW, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE A DIFFICULT CHOICE. IN ORDER TO FIND THE COAST, YOU'D WANT TO STICK CLOSE TO THE RIVER. BUT THE SALTIES CAN LIVE OVER 500 FEET FROM THE EDGE OF THE RIVER. SO IT'S EITHER RISK THE CROCS OR RISK LOSING YOUR WAY. THIS AREA, THOUGH, SHOULD BE SAFE, BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER ANIMALS HERE, LIKE THE BROLGA, A TYPE OF CRANE, AS WELL AS THE ICONIC WALLABY. BUT IT'S JUST LIKE EVERYTHING AROUND HERE -- IT'S QUICKER THAN ME, IT'S SMARTER THAN ME... [SIGHS] ...JUST BETTER AT SURVIVING THAN ME. FORCED BACK FROM THE RIVER BY THE SALTIES, YOU'LL BE AT THE MERCY OF THE SEARING HEAT AGAIN. [ SIGHS ] [ SNIFFLES ] SIGNS OF CIVILIZATION DON'T ALWAYS MEAN SAFETY, AND FINDING THIS FENCE WILL GIVE YOU LITTLE COMFORT. AUSTRALIA HAS SOME OF THE LONGEST FENCES IN THE WORLD. ONE IS OVER 3,500 MILES LONG. THAT IS 700 MILES WIDER THAN THE USA. THE CONDITIONS HERE ARE REALLY EXTREME, AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THAT ANYTHING MANAGES TO SURVIVE. BUT THOSE WHO DO, LIKE THE ABORIGINES, HAVE LEARNT TO ADAPT AND TO WORK WITH THIS UNFORGIVING WILDERNESS. IT'S ONLY THEN CAN YOU HOPE TO SURVIVE AUSTRALIA'S GREAT OUTBACK. AND WHAT I'VE LEARNT OUT HERE IS THAT THE ABORIGINES REALLY ARE THE ULTIMATE OUTBACK DWELLERS. BUT THEY'RE ALSO THE ULTIMATE GUARDIANS OF THE LAND. AND IN SO MANY WAYS, IT'S US THAT HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GREAT WILDERNESS.
