 Man vs. Wild (2006â€“2020): Season 1, Episode 14 - Ecuador - full transcript 
 Ecuador is home to the world's longest mountain range and the world's biggest and most impenetrable jungle, the Amazon. Last year, more than a million people came to experience this vast wilderness -- and 55 got lost in the country's mountains, jungles or waterways and needed to be rescued. In this episode, host Bear Grylls paraglides onto the edge of the Andes and follows rivers into the jungle -- bringing him face to face with huge colonies of spear-nosed bats, giant weevil grubs (larvae) and vicious piranhas. Bear builds a bamboo bridge and a bow and arrow to successfully catch fish, but it doesn't always go his way -- he's forced to ride the rapids of the Amazon on a single tree trunk.

 I'M BEAR GRYLLS. I'VE SERVED WITH THE BRITISH SPECIAL FORCES, CLIMBED TO THE SUMMIT OF MOUNT EVEREST, AND CROSSED THE FROZEN OCEANS OF THE ARCTIC. NOW I'M IN ECUADOR -- A COUNTRY OF EXTREME JUNGLE AND MOUNTAINS. EVERY YEAR, HUNDREDS HAVE TO BE RESCUED FROM ITS HARSH LANDSCAPE. I'M GONNA SHOW THE SKILLS NEEDED TO SURVIVE HERE. ECUADOR, A COUNTRY THE SIZE OF NEVADA, IS HOME TO THE WORLD'S LONGEST MOUNTAIN RANGE

 AND THE WORLD'S BIGGEST AND MOST IMPENETRABLE JUNGLE -- THE AMAZON. LAST YEAR, OVER A MILLION PEOPLE CAME TO EXPERIENCE THIS VAST WILDERNESS, WHERE TIME HAS STOOD STILL FOR MILLENNIA. MANY STILL GET LOST IN THE MOUNTAINS AND JUNGLES NEEDING TO BE RESCUED. I'M GONNA PARAGLIDE INTO THIS WILDERNESS. A CAMERA CREW WILL FOLLOW ME. AND, IF NEEDED, LOCAL EXPERTS WILL BE ON HAND TO ASSIST. I'M SURROUNDED BY SOME OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOUNTAINS IN THE WORLD, BUT IT IS COLD UP HERE -- JUST A FEW DEGREES ABOVE FREEZING, AND THE AIR IS THIN,

 SO THE WAY I'M GOING IN IS BY PARAGLIDER. PHEW. HERE GOES. USING THE RISING AIR CURRENTS, I'M GONNA FLY OVER THE ANDES IN THE HOPE OF LANDING SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO THE AMAZON JUNGLE. WHOO-HOO! THE ANDES ARE JUST IMMENSE, STRETCHING OVER 4,500 MILES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. IT HAS SOME OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST AND MOST ACTIVE VOLCANOES HERE. THESE CHANGING AIR CURRENTS ARE TAKING ME DOWN OVER THE PARAMO, HIGH-ALTITUDE MARSHES THAT COVER MOST OF THIS AREA -- NOT A PLACE YOU WANT TO BE. WHOA, THIS IS GONNA BE FAST COMING IN! [ GROANS ] LOOK AT THAT, IF YOU SEE -- THIS IS JUST, LIKE, WAIST-DEEP, HORRIBLE STUFF. BUT IT'S COLD UP HERE, AND I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS BOG AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. IT'S THICK, HORRIBLE SLUDGE. THIS IS NOT A GOOD START. I'M STILL ROUGHLY 12,000 FEET UP, AND THE TEMPERATURE IS JUST ABOVE FREEZING. BEING WET AND COLD AT THIS ALTITUDE IS A KILLER COMBINATION. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE SKILLS YOU'LL NEED TO SURVIVE IN THE DIFFERENT TERRAINS HERE, FROM THE CLOUD FOREST TO THE JUNGLE TO THE AMAZON RIVER. BELOW ME IS MILE UPON MILE OF DENSE, HIGH-ALTITUDE JUNGLE, WHICH, BECAUSE OF IT'S HEIGHT, IS KNOWN AS "CLOUD FOREST." FURTHER BELOW, IT'S A HOT AND HUMID AMAZON JUNGLE. [ PANTING ] LOOK AT THIS HUGE, HUGE VALLEY, AND IT'S JUST CLOUD FOREST AS FAR AS I CAN SEE. AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEAUTIFUL, IT'S ALSO QUITE DEMORALIZING. [ SIGHS ] THAT JUST MEANS MORE HARD WORK. [ SIGHS ] STILL SOAKING WET, AND I'M COLD. AND I'M ABOUT 12,000 FEET UP HERE. AND THE DANGER IS JUST EXPOSURE AND HYPOTHERMIA, AND I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE, BOTH OF THOSE CAN COME ON VERY QUICKLY. THAT'S A LETHAL COMBINATION OF COLD, WET, AND ALTITUDE. AND, GUYS, I REALLY NEED TO BE HEADING DOWN FAST. EVERY 1,000 FEET LOWER YOU GO MEANS IT GETS ABOUT 2 DEGREES WARMER. BUT MOVING AT ALTITUDE IS TOUGH. UP HERE, AT 10,000 FEET, THERE'S 15% LESS OXYGEN THAN AT SEA LEVEL. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] I FORGET JUST HOW HARD WORK IT IS, MOVING AT ALTITUDE. [ SIGHS ] [ COUGHS ] I'M NOW ENTERING CLOUD FOREST, WHERE IT WILL BE EASIER TO FIND FOOD AND SHELTER. IT'S ASTONISHING HOW QUICKLY THE VEGETATION CAN CHANGE, AND IT'S LIKE ENTERING A NEW WORLD. IT'S A LUSH YET EERIE PLACE. AS THE WARM AIR COMES UP FROM THE TROPICAL LOWLANDS, IT CONDENSES, AND YOU GET THIS AREA FROM ABOUT 8,000 TO 10,000 FEET WHERE IT'S JUST SOLID CLOUD AND RAIN. AND IT'S JUST SO STILL AROUND HERE. YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING APART FROM JUST THE PITTER-PATTER OF THE RAIN. LOOK HOW WET EVERYTHING IS. LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THIS, YOU CAN JUST PULL ALL OF THIS STUFF UP, MASSES OF IT, OFF. AND PROBABLY -- YEAH, LOOK AT THAT -- FULL OF WATER. AND I'LL DEFINITELY FIND A STREAM LOWER DOWN. BUT THERE'S ALSO THIS, LIKE, JUST SMELL OF ROTTING WOOD, AS IF THE WHOLE PLACE IS JUST DECAYING. THE CLOUD FOREST IS FAR MORE ABUNDANT THAN THE GRASSLAND. THE TEMPERATE AND DAMP CONDITIONS ARE HOME TO THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT PLANT AND ANIMAL SPECIES. LOOK AT THIS GUY I'VE JUST FOUND ON THE FOREST FLOOR. IT'S A CAECILIAN. AND THESE GUYS NORMALLY LIVE UNDERGROUND, JUST FEEDING OFF WORMS AND STUFF. BUT BECAUSE IT'S SO WET HERE -- IT'S BEEN RAINING SO MUCH -- HE'S LITERALLY FORCED UP TO THE SURFACE. AND THAT IS JUST AMAZING TO ACTUALLY COME ACROSS ONE OF THESE. ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE A SNAKE, IT'S ACTUALLY A LEGLESS LIZARD, AND IT LIVES OFF WORMS, SPIDERS, AND INSECTS. AND WE'RE GONNA LET HIM GO AND GET BACK. HE MIGHT LOOK GOOD TO EAT, BUT HE HAS POISONOUS GLANDS UNDER HIS SKIN, SO HE'S NOT GONNA BE MY LUNCH. [ GRUNTS ] I KNOW, FROM MY TIME IN THE ARMY, JUST HOW SLOW JUNGLE MOVING CAN BE. AND SOMETIMES IT WOULD TAKE ALL DAY JUST TO MOVE LIKE A MILE. AND IN THIS SORT OF STUFF, YOU CAN JUST SEE WHY. IT'S EASY TO END UP GOING 'ROUND AND 'ROUND IN CIRCLES IN THIS DENSE FORESTS. IN 1986, A TEAM OF TREASURE HUNTERS CAME TO THE CLOUD FOREST IN SEARCH OF INCA GOLD. LEGEND SAYS THE LAST EMPEROR, ATAHUALPA, ORDERED TONS OF IT TO BE HIDDEN IN ECUADOR'S CLOUD FOREST. IT IS THOUGHT THE TREASURE HUNTERS DIED AFTER BECOMING COMPLETELY DISORIENTATED. THEIR BODIES WERE DISCOVERED JUST HALF A MILE FROM THEIR CAMP. JAGUARS AND SNAKES LIVE IN THE FOREST, BUT THEY ARE RARE. THE MORE DEADLY KILLERS ARE THE PLANTS. THIS IS A FULIOTIS MUSHROOM, AND THESE ARE POISONOUS AND NASTY. AND IF I ATE THIS, THIS COULD DESTROY MY KIDNEYS IN 24 HOURS. AND REALLY, IN THE WILD, YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE ANY CHANCES. UNLESS YOU'RE AN EXPERT IN MUSHROOMS AND TOADSTOOLS, YOUR BEST THING TO DO IS STAY CLEAR OF THEM. THE TOXINS ARE SO DEADLY THAT, ONCE CONSUMED, THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE OR CURE. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] THE WARM AND DAMP CONDITIONS MEANS PLANTS GROW UP TO 20 FEET A YEAR. THAT'S FAST. AND THE VINES CAN FORM SUCH DENSE SCREENS, YOU CAN HARDLY SEE IN FRONT OF YOU. YOU JUST GET COMPLETELY TANGLED IN ALL THIS STUFF. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT? SOMETIMES YOU JUST GRIND TO A HALT. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IF POSSIBLE, TRY TO AVOID MOVING THROUGH DENSE UNDERGROWTH, AS YOU'LL WASTE PRECIOUS ENERGY. SUDDENLY, THE JUNGLE GIVES WAY TO A NARROW CHANNEL. THIS WAS PROBABLY CUT INTO THE EARTH BY HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF WATER EROSION. IT'S LIKE AN EXPRESS FREEWAY THROUGH THE JUNGLE AND IT LEADS TO A CAVE. LET'S HAVE A LOOK IN HERE. CAVES LIKE THIS ARE FORBIDDING PLACES. [ SCREECHING ] THERE'S SOMETHING FLYING AROUND UP THERE! I'M IN A NARROW CAVE IN ECUADOR... ...BUT I'M NOT ALONE. HEY, LOOK. PUT THE NIGHT-VISION ON. YOU SEE THOSE? YEAH, LOOK, THEY'RE BATS -- JUST HUNDREDS OF THEM. YOU CAN FEEL THEIR WINGS JUST FLAP PAST MY HEAD. AND THEY'RE SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FLIERS, JUST FLYING ALL ON SONAR. THESE SPEARNOSE BATS LIVE IN COLONIES OF AROUND 5,000. THERE'S SO MANY HERE, I COULD PROBABLY GRAB ONE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT, 'CAUSE IF I GOT BIT BY ONE, THEY CARRY A RISK OF RABIES. THE STENCH IN HERE IS ALMOST UNBEARABLE. THE FLOOR OF THIS CAVE IS COVERED IN GUANO, OR BAT DROPPINGS. THE FUMES ARE HIGHLY TOXIC, AND IT'S A BREEDING GROUND FOR BITING INSECTS. [ GRUNTS ] I WANT TO GET OUT OF THIS CAVE. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IF THERE'S ONE THING I REALLY DON'T LIKE, IT'S BATS. YEAH, I NEED TO FIND A BETTER PLACE. AND THAT'S BACK INTO THE DENSE CLOUD FOREST. ALWAYS BE AWARE OF THE TYPE OF TERRAIN YOU'RE IN. IT CAN HELP GUIDE YOU OUT OF DENSE JUNGLE. THIS IS A CREEK, AND I CAN FOLLOW THIS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO A RIVER. AND THESE CREEKS AND RIVERS REALLY ARE THE HIGHWAYS OF THE FOREST. AND AS I FOLLOW THE STREAM DOWN, THE NOISE OF CRASHING WATER GETS PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER. [ WATER FLOWING LOUDLY ] THERE'S NO MISTAKING THIS SOUND -- WHITE WATER. YEAH, LOOK AT THIS. THIS FAST-FLOWING RIVER COMES STRAIGHT FROM THE SNOWCAPPED ANDES. IT'S GLACIAL AND FREEZING COLD. IT DEMANDS A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESPECT, THESE SORT OF STREAMS. THEY'RE VERY, VERY POWERFUL. AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE VERY CAREFUL MOVING ALONG THE BANK, WHERE IT'S SLIPPY. THERE'S ALWAYS FOOD TO EAT IN THE FOREST IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS ORCHID HERE, THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE ORCHIDS, 'CAUSE IT'S EASY TO IDENTIFY. IT'S CALLED A BROWN-SPOTTED YELLOW ORCHID, 'CAUSE IT'S GOT BROWN SPOTS AND IT'S YELLOW. BUT WHAT'S GREAT ABOUT IT IS THAT YOU CAN EAT IT, AS WELL. THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF EDIBLE PLANT SPECIES IN THE CLOUD FOREST, AND IT'S LIKE A FEAST IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK. LOOK, LOOK, THESE BEGONIAS. SEE THESE? THESE ARE ACTUALLY EDIBLE. AND YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THESE FROM THEIR FLESHY RED FLOWERS AND THEIR ALTERNATE, UNEVEN LEAVES. AND IF YOU EAT ONE OF THE FLOWERS, THEY'RE QUITE SWEET. THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF GLUCOSE IN THEM. AND THEN THE LEAVES, AS WELL. THIS TASTES LIKE MORE SOUR. THE LEAVES HAVE GOT LOTS OF VITAMINS AND MINERALS IN THEM. AND MOVING THROUGH CLOUD FOREST, EVERY LITTLE BIT OF ENERGY HELPS. BUT NOT EVERYTHING IS EDIBLE. THIS TREE REALLY IS NATURE HAVING ORGANIZED HERSELF IN THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY WAY. IT WOULD BE SO EASY JUST TO WALK STRAIGHT PAST THIS AND NOT NOTICE THE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF CATERPILLARS THAT ARE WRAPPED AROUND IT HERE. AND THIS IS LIKE SORT OF NATURE'S PROGRESSION FROM THE CATERPILLAR TO THE COCOONS HERE TO EVENTUALLY, WHEN THEY BECOME BUTTERFLIES. TWO OF THE MOST DANGEROUS THINGS IN THE RAINFOREST ARE ACTUALLY ANTS AND CATERPILLARS. AND IF YOU TOUCH THIS, EACH OF THESE TINY LITTLE HAIRS CAN CONTAIN TOXINS THAT CAN ACTUALLY IRRITATE YOUR SKIN SOMETIMES FOR UP TO A YEAR. THESE ARE LITTLE IMMATURE FERN FRONDS, AND THESE ARE ACTUALLY EDIBLE, AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE AROUND HERE WILL HARVEST THESE AND THEN EAT THEM. BUT YOU NEED TO BOIL THEM TWICE BEFORE YOU DO EAT THEM. BUT YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THEM JUST FROM THE MONKEY-TAIL SHAPE AND ALSO THE WAY THEY'RE COVERED IN THIS HORRIBLE SLIME. BUT THEY DEVELOP THIS JUST TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM BEING EATEN FROM BUGS. BUT I'M GONNA CUT THE TOP HALF OF THESE OFF AND THEN BOIL THEM AND EAT THEM LATER. BOILING THEM TWICE REMOVES THE TOXIC SLIME, WHICH CAN CAUSE SEVERE STOMACH CRAMPS. WHOA! GOSH! BUT IT'S TIME TO FIND SHELTER. I COULD BUILD ONE, BUT THERE'S PLENTY OF NATURAL SHELTER AROUND HERE. THERE'S A CAVE OVER THERE JUST IN THE BLACK. AND I'M BEGINNING TO SEE A FEW OF THESE NOW, AND THAT WILL BE A PERFECT PLACE, SOMEWHERE LIKE THAT, TO SPEND THE NIGHT. BUT THE CAVE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WATER. AND THIS WATER IS TOO FAST-FLOWING AND DEEP TO WADE THROUGH. BUT I'VE JUST PASSED SOME BAMBOO BACK THERE, AND THAT'S MADE ME THINK OF HOW WE USED TO CROSS A LOT CREVASSES ON EVEREST. AND IT'S GIVEN ME AN IDEA. THERE LITERALLY ARE OVER 100 SPECIES OF BAMBOO. AND WHAT I'M HOPING IS THAT THIS STUFF SOUNDS THIN-WALLED ENOUGH TO LET ME GET THROUGH WITH JUST THIS LITTLE KNIFE. LET'S SEE IF THIS WORKS. YEAH, THIS IS -- THIS IS CUTTING THROUGH ALL RIGHT. EXCELLENT. WITH THE TEAM'S HELP, I'M TRYING TO MAKE A LADDER. [ GRUNTS ] TWO LONG PIECES OF BAMBOO AND SOME CROSS STRAPS ATTACHED WITH VINE SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD AT LEAST 200 POUNDS. THEN, I'LL BE ABLE TO CROSS OVER TO THE CAVE. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR ARE SOME VINES, JUST TO LASH THESE CROSS BRACES TOGETHER. BUT THE STUFF I NEED IS NOT THIS. THIS IS ALL DEAD AND WILL BREAK. I'M LOOKING FOR THE LIVING STUFF. LIKE THIS. HERE YOU GO. THIS IS -- THIS STUFF I THINK IS WHAT THEY CALL A LITTLE YANG VINE. AND IT'S GOOD, IT'S BENDY, IT'S SUPPLE, AND IT'S LIVING. SO...I'LL FIND A FEW MORE OF THESE. I'M GONNA USE SPLIT SAPLINGS AS CROSS STRUTS. I'VE GOT THE FIRST CROSS BRACE HERE. AND THEN ALL I NEED TO DO IS USE SOME OF THIS NICE FLEXIBLE VINE TO TIE IT WITH. NATURE PROVIDES ALL THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED. THE GREAT THING ABOUT THESE VINES IS THAT JUST ONE OR TWO HITCHES, AND 'CAUSE THAT'S QUITE LIVING AND IT'S DAMP, THEY ACTUALLY TIGHTEN ON THEMSELVES, AND THEY'RE REALLY SECURE. [ GRUNTS ] [ GRUNTS ] THE BAMBOO MAY BE HOLLOW, BUT A STRUCTURE THIS BIG COULD BE HEAVY. THIS PROBABLY WEIGHS 150 POUNDS, SO BUILD IT NEAR TO WHERE YOU NEED IT. ONCE IN PLACE, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO WALK OVER THE WATER TO MY CAVE. [ GRUNTS ] THIS LADDER IS ALMOST IN PLACE NOW. AND EVEN THOUGH ALL THE MATERIALS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE LIGHT, THE LADDER ITSELF IS PRETTY HEAVY. BUT JUST SHOWS WHAT A LITTLE BIT OF LARGER THINKING CAN DO. HERE WE GO. OH, NO! IT'S JUST COMPLETELY SMASHED. THIS IS A DISASTER! I'M IN THE CLOUD FOREST OF ECUADOR, TRYING TO CROSS A GLACIAL RIVER WITH A BAMBOO-LADDER BRIDGE, WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. WELL, THAT'S THE REALITY OF SURVIVAL. IT DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK, AND I'M BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. IT'S GETTING PRETTY LATE IN THE DAY NOW, AND I HAVEN'T REALLY GOT TIME FOR SHELTER AND A FIRE, AND I'VE GOT TO PRIORITIZE. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING FOR ME IS REALLY TO GET A FIRE. I NEED TO GET DRY, AND I NEED TO GET WARM. AND THE GOOD THING ABOUT THIS FOREST, 'CAUSE IT'S QUITE DENSE ABOVE -- THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF NATURAL SHELTER ANYWAY IF IT DOES RAIN. BUT I'VE GOT TO GO AND TRY AND FIND A BIT OF TINDER TO GET THAT FIRE GOING. FINDING DRY TINDER IN THESE WET CONDITIONS MIGHT LOOK IMPOSSIBLE, BUT IT'S NOT IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK. IF YOU LOOK AROUND HERE, YOU SEE ALL THESE RABBIT DROPPINGS. THERE ARE MORE HERE. AND THESE ARE RABBIT TRAILS. AND WHAT THEY DO, THEY CREATE THESE BURROWS UNDER ALL THESE GRASS. LOOK, YOU SEE HERE. AND THEN, INSIDE IT, YOU GET THIS DRY GRASS. IT'S LIKE THE RABBITS HAVE DONE MY JOB FOR ME. SO, I NEED A FEW MORE OF THESE. I HAVE TO BE QUICK. THE RAINS, WHICH FALL EVERY EVENING, ARE JUST BEGINNING. EVERYTHING JUST HERE IS SO WET. [ SIGHS ] IT'S JUST MAKING GETTING THIS FIRE GOING REALLY DIFFICULT. THE PROBLEM IS, ALL OF THIS GRASS THAT I'VE COLLECTED EARLIER IS ALL NOW JUST SOAKING WET. MY KINDLING IS WET, MY WOOD IS WET, AND I'M COLD AT THE MOMENT. [ SIGHS ] [ Sighing ] OH, DEAR. IT'S LIKE EVERY TIME I GET A SPARK, THIS BLOOMING RAIN JUST PUTS IT OUT. DO YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER BEFORE ACTUALLY FAILED TO GET A FIRE GOING? [ SIGHS ] COME ON. DO YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS A LOSING BATTLE. THE BEST THING I CAN DO, ACTUALLY, WITH THIS GRASS NOW IS JUST STUFF IT DOWN MY SHIRT... ...AND USE THIS AS INSULATION AND HOPE THAT IT KEEPS ME WARM THROUGH THIS NIGHT. AND WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ACTS LIKE, KIND OF, DOWN AND WILL INSULATE, HOPEFULLY, A LOT OF THE HEAT. AND IT MAKES ME LOOK AS IF I'VE EATEN TOO MANY CHEESECAKES, BUT IT SHOULD WORK. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- I'D MURDER A CHEESECAKE, AS WELL, AT THE MOMENT. [ RAIN PATTERING ] AND IT'S... KIND OF WEIRD SOMETIMES BEING IN THESE FORESTS WHEN IT'S DARK. BUT MY MISSION NOW IS REALLY JUST TO TRY AND GET...AS WARM AS I CAN WITH THIS GRASS STUFF AND KEEP MY CHIN UP AND SEE THIS NIGHT THROUGH. IT RAINED FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT. BUT WHEN THINGS SEEM REALLY BAD, IT'S OFTEN THE LITTLE THINGS THAT CAN GIVE YOU HOPE. LOOK, YOU SEE UP THERE? YOU SEE THAT LITTLE PURPLE FLOWER JUST ON ITS OWN? SO BEAUTIFUL. AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT MOVING THROUGH THIS SORT OF TERRAIN IS HARD WORK, AND IT'S OFTEN THE LITTLE THINGS THAT GIVE YOU A PICK-ME-UP. BUT FOR ME, IT'S SUDDENLY COMING ACROSS THAT SORT OF A FLOWER. AND I ALWAYS THINK IT'S LIKE GOD'S EXTRAVAGANCE. IT'S THERE. NOBODY MIGHT EVER SEE IT. IT'S LIKE NATURE CAN'T HELP BUT CREATE BEAUTIFUL THINGS. I JUST LOVE THAT. AFTER BEING SOAKED FOR 24 HOURS, MY STRENGTH IS BEING SAPPED. BUT BEFORE LONG, MY PATH ALONG THE RIVERBANK COMES TO AN ABRUPT END. I CAN EITHER TRY AND WADE IT -- THE THING IS, I'M JUST GONNA END UP SOAKING WET, AND THIS WATER IS COLD, AND THAT'S THE LAST THING I REALLY WANT. THE OTHER OPTION IS JUST TO JUMP AND GO FOR THIS TREE. AND THE WORST THING THAT CAN HAPPEN IS THAT I'LL END UP IN THE DRINK, WET ANYWAY. BUT AT LEAST THIS WAY THERE'S A CHANCE I CAN STAY DRY. GRAB THE BRANCH WITH BOTH HANDS AND THEN USE YOUR MOMENTUM TO SWING YOUR LEGS UP. BUT WATCH OUT FOR LOOSE MOSS. WHEW! I'M RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF THE RAINFOREST. AND, FROM NOW ON, THINGS ARE GONNA GET A LOT TOUGHER. I'M OUT OF THE CLOUD FOREST OF ECUADOR, AND I'M ENTERING THE DARK JUNGLES OF THE MIGHTY AMAZON. THE RAINFOREST HERE HAS OVER 9 FEET OF RAINFALL EVERY YEAR, AND IT'S HOME TO OVER A MILLION SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS. I'M DEFINITELY NOW DOWN IN THE RAINFOREST, AND I CAN TELL THIS JUST BECAUSE OF THE HEIGHT OF THE TREE CANOPIES ABOVE ME. SOME OF THESE ARE PROBABLY ABOUT 80 FOOT HIGH. AND ALSO IT'S MUCH, MUCH MORE HUMID DOWN HERE -- REALLY NOTICEABLY SO. I'M NOW DOWN IN A PRETTY PERMANENT-LOOKING CREEK. IN THE WET SEASON, THIS WOULD BE A RAGING TORRENT, BUT AT THE MOMENT, I CAN USE IT TO LEAD ME DOWN. [ THUNDER RUMBLING ] SO, YOU SEE HERE WHERE TWO STREAMS MEET IN, LIKE, A JUNCTION. BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS, JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THE FLOW OF THE WATER DOWNHILL. IN THE JUNGLE, THERE ARE TORRENTIAL SHOWERS EVERY DAY. OVER HALF A MILLION GALLONS WILL FALL ON EACH ACRE. THIS RAIN HAS ONE BLESSING. GIVES ME A CHANCE TO GET RID OF THE STENCH OF ALL THE LAST FEW DAYS. WHOO! AND THE RAINS FINISHED AS QUICKLY AS THEY BEGAN. THIS PART OF THE AMAZON HAS A HUGE VARIETY OF WILDLIFE -- OVER 8% OF THE WORLD'S ANIMAL SPECIES -- AND THESE ARE SOME I'M COME ACROSS. THESE RAINFORESTS ARE JUST SO UNFORGIVING, AND EVERY ANIMAL IN IT HAS A SURVIVAL STRATEGY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS LITTLE STICK INSECT, PERFECTLY BLENDED IN AGAINST THIS TREE. AND I MIGHT WALK PAST 100 OF THESE BEFORE I'LL ACTUALLY SEE ONE. AND THEY ACTUALLY SAY YOU ONLY SEE ABOUT 2% OF THE ANIMALS THAT ARE ACTUALLY OUT THERE. LOOK AT THAT. PERFECTLY CAMOUFLAGED. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THIS, THIS IS A BIRD CRICKET, AND IT'S CALLED THAT BECAUSE IT'S THE SIZE OF, LIKE, A SMALL BIRD. AND JUST AMAZING. LOOK. ALSO, EVERYTHING IN THIS JUNGLE IS, LIKE, A SURVIVAL EXPERT. AND THIS FELLA'S TACTIC IS TO HAVE THESE THORNS ON HIS LEGS. AND IF ANYTHING GETS CLOSE -- WHAM! -- JUST KICKS AWAY WITH THOSE THORNY LEGS. AMAZING. WHAT I'VE GOT HERE IS A LITTLE FISHING SPIDER. AND, ACTUALLY, HE'S NOT SO LITTLE. HE'S NOT A BAD SIZE. BUT WHAT THIS GUY WOULD DO IS SIT ON THE EDGE OF THE BANK, AND THEY'LL ACTUALLY FISH AND CATCH A LITTLE MINNOW, EVEN THE SIZE OF, LIKE, MY LITTLE FINGER. BUT THIS GUY IS POISONOUS. AND THE LOCALS SAY THAT IF THEY GET BIT BY THIS, THEY ACTUALLY THEN EAT IT TO TRY TO COUNTERACT THE VENOM. WELL, I DON'T WANT TO TRY THAT. I'M GONNA LET THIS -- LET HIM GO. LOOK AT THESE GUYS. THESE ARE PALM-WEEVIL GRUBS. WOW, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, THESE ARE THE BIGGEST GRUBS I'VE EVER SEEN. LOOK. AND THIS IS JUST THE SORT OF PLACE THAT THEY LIKE. THEY FEED OFF ALL THIS ROTTING, SOFT INTERIOR OF THE PALM TREE. BUT THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE. AND, ACTUALLY, THE LOCALS EAT A LOT OF THESE. THEY'RE LIKE A DELICACY. THEY'RE FULL OF GOOD PROTEIN. AND -- UGH -- YOU CAN ACTUALLY EAT THEM WHOLE. LOOK AT IT WRIGGLING AROUND. [ GAGS ] HOLY SMOKE. THAT IS...JUST... THE GUARANI TRIBE OF THE AMAZON CONSIDER THESE A REAL DELICACY. ...HORRIBLE. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY CAN KEEP THEIR DELICACY. UGH. I'LL JUST TRY AND GET ONE MORE DOWN. THEY'RE A MOUTHFUL OF GOO, WITH A TEXTURE OF CREAM CHEESE WITH CRUNCHY LUMPS OF GRISTLE. [ SPITTING ] BUT THE AMAZON RAINFOREST IS ALSO FULL OF LIFE THAT IS EASY ON THE PALATE. JUST BEGINNING TO DRIZZLE AGAIN, AND THAT'S A GOOD TIME FOR A BIT OF FISHING, AS WELL. THE RAIN WILL DISTRACT THE FISH, AND MAKE IT EASIER TO GET IN CLOSE. THE LOCAL GUARANI TRIBE HAVE TRADITIONALLY USED A BOW AND ARROW LIKE THIS ONE TO CATCH FISH. I'LL BE SHOWING SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES THEY USE TO MAKE THEM. AND THIS IS OLD CHONTA PALM HERE THAT'S FALLEN DOWN. AND THIS STUFF IS IDEAL BECAUSE IT'S VERY HARD, BUT ALSO IT ALLOWS ME TO SPLINTER IT LENGTHWISE. THE BOW I'M WHITTLING IS ESPECIALLY GOOD FOR SPEARING FAST-MOVING FISH IN SHALLOW POOLS. THIS CHONTA-PALM WOOD HAS JUST BEEN PERFECT. IT'S TAKEN ME ABOUT 15 MINUTES, AND ALREADY I'VE WHITTLED THAT DOWN INTO SOMETHING ABOUT THE RIGHT LENGTH. A GUARANI HUNTER WILL TAKE DAYS TO MAKE ONE OF THESE. BUT THEY EXPECT THEIRS TO LAST FOR YEARS. I JUST NOW NEED TO CUT A COUPLE OF NOTCHES IN EACH END THAT I'M GONNA ATTACH THE DRAWSTRING TO. THE PITA PALM GROWS THROUGHOUT THE JUNGLE. THE LEAVES CONTAIN LONG FIBERS THAT MAKE PERFECT BOWSTRINGS. THIS PITA HAS THESE NASTY LITTLE BARBS ALL THE WAY DOWN IT, SO THE FIRST THING I NEED TO DO IS JUST TAKE THOSE OFF. ONCE I'VE GOT IT LIKE THIS, I NEED TO JUST OPEN THIS OUT. [ FIBERS SNAPPING ] AND I JUST WANT TO SEPARATE THE FLESHY BIT FROM THE ACTUAL STRONG BACK OF THESE LEAVES. AND NOW I JUST TAKE THE STRANDS OF THIS, PUT IT IN MY MOUTH, AND THEN START TO WEAVE IT. WEAVING THE STRANDS TOGETHER INCREASES THEIR STRENGTH AND DURABILITY. ONCE ON THE BOW, THEY'LL NEED TO COPE WITH HUGE PRESSURE. AND NOW TO ATTACH IT, WHAT I'VE DONE DOWN THIS END, I'VE PUT A SIMPLE BOWLINE LOOP ONTO IT THERE. AND THEN ON THIS SIDE, I DO THE SAME. TO TIE THIS BOWLINE, ALL I DO IS MAKE A LITTLE LOOP LIKE THIS, AND I PUT THIS END THROUGH THE THING. AND A GOOD WAY TO REMEMBER IT IS THE RABBIT COMES OUT OF THE HOLE, AROUND THE TREE, AND THEN BACK DOWN THE HOLE. [ GRUNTS ] AND THAT THEN... ...IS READY. THE ARROWS ARE MADE OF THE SAME HEAVY WOOD AS THE BOW, PERFECT FOR CUTTING THROUGH THE WATER. I'M GONNA TRY AND USE IT IN THIS RIVER TO CATCH PIRANHA FISH. THEY'RE FAST AND AGGRESSIVE, AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. I'M IN THE ECUADORIAN RAINFOREST, HUNTING FOR FISH. THIS VEGETATION IS JUST THE SORT OF PLACE THAT FISH LIKE TO HIDE, ESPECIALLY AT THIS TIME OF DAY NOW. PIRANHA LIVE IN THESE SORT OF STREAMS, AND THEY CAN BE VICIOUS -- STRIPPING ANIMALS THAT FALL INTO THE WATER IN SECONDS. BUT THAT ONLY HAPPENS WHEN THEY'RE IN LARGE SHOALS OF 100 OR MORE. THIS POND IS JUST TOO SMALL TO SUPPORT THAT MANY, SO IT SHOULD BE SAFE TO BE IN. PIRANHAS ARE TASTY, BUT THEY'RE ALSO DIFFICULT TO CATCH. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT -- THEY'RE QUICK, THESE FISH. RECENTLY, A WOMAN WAS STRANDED IN THE RAINFOREST AND SURVIVED ALONE FOR TWO WEEKS BY CATCHING PIRANHAS IN A SHALLOW RIVER. SHE USED ONLY INSECTS FOR BAIT. I NEED TO FIND SOME SHALLOWER POOLS, WHERE I CAN REALLY SEE WHAT'S ON THE BOTTOM. WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS THAT YOU'VE GOT THIS JUNGLE POOL WHERE THE WATER LEVEL ACTUALLY IS DROPPING. AND YOU CAN SEE ON THE BANK, THE LEVEL THAT THE WATER WAS. IF I COULD JUST GET THE CAMERA AND PUT IT INTO THE WATER, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THEM SWIMMING AROUND. BRILLIANT! LOOK AT THAT! AND IMAGINE 1,000 OF THOSE. YOU CAN SEE WHY IT'D JUST STRIP THE FLESH OFF A HUMAN IN SECONDS. RAZOR-SHARP TEETH. AND THIS GUY'S PRETTY WELL DEAD, AND HE STILL HAS THE POWER TO GO STRAIGHT THROUGH THIS. IT'S ESSENTIAL PIRANHA ARE COOKED THOROUGHLY, BECAUSE THEY CAN CARRY HARMFUL PARASITES. I'VE GOT A LITTLE COOKING RACK HERE. AND ON IT, I'VE GOT MY FERN FRONDS BUBBLING AWAY, AND I'VE BOILED THESE A COUPLE OF TIMES AND JUST CHANGED THE WATER, JUST TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE REALLY WELL COOKED. AND I'VE GOT SOME OF THE OTHER FERN FRONDS COOKING IN THESE BAMBOO SECTIONS HERE. AND THEN, WRAPPED IN THESE LEAVES, I'VE GOT MY PIRANHA THAT I'VE CAUGHT. AND THESE SHOULD BE READY NOW. AND LOOK, THERE YOU GO -- THOSE ARE THOSE NASTY TEETH GRINNING AWAY AT ME. BUT THAT -- THAT SMELLS GREAT. SO, I'M GONNA PUT THAT ONTO THIS LEAF HERE. AND IT'S SO NICE JUST ACTUALLY HAVING A BIT OF TIME NOW TO COOK THIS PROPERLY AND GET SOMETHING REALLY DECENT TO EAT -- FISH, THE FRONDS -- AND THEN REALLY ENJOY IT PROPERLY. AND THIS IS NOW ALL LOOKING LIKE QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL MEAL. AND THEY TASTE LIKE REALLY GOOEY, GUNKY ASPARAGUS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THESE WOULD BE SO NICE WITH A BIT OF MAYO. LET'S TRY IT WITH A BIT OF PIRANHA INSTEAD. FOR SUCH AN AGGRESSIVE... UNPLEASANT FISH, IT DOESN'T HALF TASTE GOOD. SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE, I'VE PICKED UP A FEW CUTS. BUT IN THE RAINFOREST, THERE'S A TREE THAT CAN HELP ME. YEAH, LOOK, THOSE ARE THE HEART-SHAPED LEAVES I WAS LOOKING FOR AND ALSO THIS SMOOTH TRUNK. AND THIS TELLS ME THIS TREE IS A SANGRE DE DRAGO, WHICH LITERALLY MEANS "DRAGON'S BLOOD." AND THE REASON IT'S CALLED THAT IS 'CAUSE THE SAP INSIDE IT IS RED. AND BEFORE I CAME OUT HERE, I WAS TOLD TO LOOK OUT FOR THIS TREE IF I EVER CUT MYSELF, JUST BECAUSE THE PROPERTIES OF THE SAP ARE VERY GOOD ANTISEPTIC AND HEALING. AND IF YOU WATCH THIS, AS SOON AS I TACK IN, YOU'LL SEE THE BLOOD SAP START TO OOZE OUT. AND THEN ANY LITTLE, LIKE, NICKS I'VE GOT, I CAN PUT IT ON. AND LOOK, IF YOU WATCH THIS, AS WELL, AS SOON AS YOU GET IT ON, IF YOU, LIKE, LATHER IT UP. IT GOES INTO THIS WHITE PASTE, LIKE, KIND OF SOAP. AND THAT IS VERY HEALING, GOOD ANTISEPTIC AND WILL HELP THE BLOOD TO COAGULATE. GREAT TREE. WHOO-HOO! NEXT, I'LL SHOW HOW TO COPE WITH THE RAPIDS OF THE AMAZON. IF YOU'RE LOST IN THE AMAZON JUNGLE, A RIVER IS YOUR BEST BET TO LEAD YOU BACK TO CIVILIZATION. AND WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR SURVIVAL, GETTING IN A RIVER WILL ALLOW YOU TO MOVE FASTER, BUT ONLY DO IT AS A LAST RESORT. THE TECHNIQUE IN RAPIDS IS TO KEEP YOUR LEGS AND FEET IN FRONT OF YOU. THIS WILL YOU FEND OFF ANY ROCKS. FOR THE RAPIDS SOON START TO GET BIGGER, AND EVENTUALLY IT BECOMES JUST TOO DANGEROUS. WELL, I'VE REACHED THIS BIG RIVER, AND THAT'S BEEN A PRIMARY GOAL FROM THE START OF THIS JOURNEY -- TO REACH A BIG RIVER -- BUT IT'S BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT. AND IT'S ALSO GOT SOME SENSIBLE-SIZED RAPIDS ON IT, WHICH MEANS IT'S TOO RISKY REALLY FOR ME TO GO DOWN JUST ON MY OWN. I'M GONNA NEED TO FIND SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA HELP ME. RIVERS LIKE THIS ONE ARE THE HIGHWAYS OF THE AMAZON, AND THEY OFFER YOU THE GREATEST CHANCE OF REACHING A SETTLEMENT. AND IF YOU CAN'T MOVE ANY FURTHER ON FOOT, LOOK OUT FOR THE BALSA TREE. IT COULD BE A LIFESAVER. [ TAPPING ] AND YOU CAN TELL THESE BY THEIR GRAY MOTTLED BARK AND DISTINCTIVE FAN-SHAPED LEAVES. IT'S VERY SOFT AND VERY BUOYANT. AWESOME. THAT'S CUT DOWN THEN. CUT MYSELF A LENGTH OF IT ABOUT... ...ABOUT HERE. 10 YEARS AGO, A GROUP OF HIKERS WERE LOST IN THE JUNGLE. THEY SURVIVED BY BUILDING A SIMPLE RAFT OUT OF BALSA LASHED TOGETHER WITH VINES, AND THEY SIMPLY FLOATED DOWNSTREAM. AFTER THREE DAYS, THEY REACHED A SETTLEMENT. IT'S PRETTY SMOOTH, THIS BIT, BUT I CAN HEAR THERE ARE MORE RAPIDS AHEAD. AND THE WORST BIT OF IT IS YOU CAN HEAR THEM BEFORE YOU CAN SEE THEM, AND YOU DON'T REALLY SEE WHAT'S AHEAD UNTIL YOU'RE KIND OF RIGHT INTO IT. BUT THIS BALSA WOOD IS GIVING ME SO MUCH BUOYANCY, AND IT MEANS REALLY I CAN JUST CLING TO IT, KEEP MY FEET DOWNSTREAM, AND SAY MY PRAYERS. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] AAH! [ GRUNTS ] I LANDED RIGHT ON THAT ROCK! [ MOANS ] THE WATER LEVEL IS NOW DROPPING LOWER AND LOWER, AND THE SHARP BEDROCK BENEATH ME CAN BREAK BONES. IT'S TIME TO GET OUT OF THE RIVER. THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME NOW. IN THE AMAZON, IT CAN FEEL LIKE EVERY STEP IS A STRUGGLE AGAINST THE FORCES OF NATURE. BUT IT'S VITAL THAT YOU NEVER GIVE UP, EVEN IF YOUR PLANS FAIL. AND, REMEMBER, EVERY DAY THAT YOU SURVIVE, GIVES YOU ANOTHER CHANCE TO REACH SAFETY.
