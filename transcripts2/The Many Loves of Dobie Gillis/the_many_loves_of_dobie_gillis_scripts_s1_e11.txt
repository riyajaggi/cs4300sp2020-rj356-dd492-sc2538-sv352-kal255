 ♪ NO MATTER ♪ ♪ HE'S HERS AND HERS ALONE ♪ ♪ DOBIE! ♪ NOPE, I GUESS IT CAN'T BE DONE. I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIGURE IF THERE WAS SOME WAY OF GETTING INTO THE WORLD WITHOUT GOING THROUGH PARENTS. THE TROUBLE IS MY PARENTS DON'T UNDERSTAND ME. 'COURSE, A LOT OF THE TIME, I DON'T UNDERSTAND ME, BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SMARTER THAN I AM. THE REAL PROBLEM IS MY PARENTS ARE UNDEPENDABLE. NOW, I WOULDN'T COMPLAIN IF THEY WERE JUST NORMALLY UNDEPENDABLE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE'S PARENTS, BUT WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN DEPEND ON THEIR BEING UNDEPENDABLE, THAT'S REALLY UNDEPENDABLE.

 NOW, YOU TAKE MY BIRTHDAY, FOR INSTANCE. THE DAY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY, I LAID IT RIGHT ON THE LINE FOR THEM. MOM, YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT FOR MY BIRTHDAY? - WHAT'S THAT, DEAR? - I WANT YOU TO FORGET THE WHOLE THING. - THAT'S ENOUGH SUGAR, DOBIE. - JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE A YEAR OLDER. WHY THE BIG FUSS? BIRTHDAY PARTIES WITH SILLY LOOKING HATS AND HORNS, THAT'S FOR KIDS. WHO NEEDS IT? - WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT THE CEREAL IN THE SUGAR BOWL? - HERBERT, SUGAR IS ENERGY. - IT IS ALSO NINE CENTS A POUND WHOLESALE. - SO DO ME A FAVOR, HUH? TOMORROW, FOR MY BIRTHDAY, DON'T EVEN MENTION IT. OKAY? OKAY. - YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN ABOUT PARENTS? COULD I HAVE MADE IT ANY PLAINER? COULD I? I SAID DON'T EVEN TALK ABOUT IT. SO THE NEXT MORNING IS MY BIRTHDAY, AND WHAT HAPPENS? THEY DON'T EVEN MENTION IT. - NOW, HERBERT, REMEMBER, IT'S DOBIE'S BIRTHDAY, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SAY A WORD ABOUT IT, NOT A SINGLE WORD. - YOU KNOW, WINNIE, THAT'S THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT BOY HAS SHOWN ANY SENSE ABOUT ANYTHING. WHY, THAT PARTY WOULD'VE COST A FORTUNE IN COLD CUTS ALONE. - OH, WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THE PARTY. - NOT TO MENTION THE WAY THOSE KIDS CAN EAT CAKE AND ICE CREAM AND GUZZLE... WHAT? - I SAID WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE THE PARTY. - I WILL NOT BREAK MY VOW TO THAT BOY. HE SAT RIGHT OVER THERE YESTERDAY MORNING, AND HE SAID, "I DO NOT WANT A PARTY," AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE IS NOT GOING TO GET, A PARTY. - BUT OF COURSE HE WANTS ONE, AND IT'LL BE A WONDERFUL SURPRISE. CAN'T YOU JUST SEE HIS FACE? - OH, I CAN JUST SEE HIS FACE, AND HE'S STUFFING IT WITH COLD CUTS. I'M GOING DOWN TO THE STORE. - I'LL BE DOWN AS SOON AS I'VE GIVEN DOBIE HIS BREAKFAST. - LOCK UP THE SUGAR, HUH? - GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING. - GOOD MORNING, DEAR. - WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY? - DRINK YOUR JUICE. - SURE IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT? - I GUESS SO, DEAR.

IT'S OKAY. - NO, IT ISN'T, BUT IT'S GOING TO BE. - GOOD MORNING, DAD. - OH, YOU THINK SO, HUH? - SURE IS A BEAUTIFUL DAY, ISN'T IT? - WELL, WHEN I GET A MINUTE, I'LL TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR BEAUTIFUL DAY. ONLY BY THEN, IT'LL BE NIGHT. - I MEAN, IT'S A SPECIAL KIND OF BEAUTIFUL DAY, YOU KNOW, LIKE A ONCE A YEAR DAY, KIND OF A SPECIAL DAY. - YOU MEAN A SPECIAL DAY LIKE WHEN YOU COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND PUT ON AN APRON AND GO TO WORK IN THE STORE? - I GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL, DAD.
