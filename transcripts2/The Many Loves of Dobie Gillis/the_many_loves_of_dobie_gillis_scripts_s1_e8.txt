 IT'S ENOUGH TO DRIVE A MAN TO DRINK. - [ CHANTING/CHEERING ] - HI EARTHMEN. - OH, HI, MAYNARD. - HEY, YOU GOING TO THE GAME SATURDAY, MAYNARD? - SURE. YOU GOING? - SURE. - YOU THINK THE TEAM'S GOING? - HEY, THAT'S NO ATTITUDE TO TAKE. - WE'RE GOING TO WIN THIS YEAR, AREN'T WE, DOBIE? - YOU'RE DARN RIGHT. I CAN JUST HEAR US SINGING THAT OLD VICTORY SONG. - WHAT WE NEED IS, LIKE, A DEFEAT SONG. ♪ WE'RE GONNA LOSE, IT AIN'T NO NEWS ♪ ♪ WE'RE GONNA LOSE, WE GOT THE BLUES ♪ - KNOCK IT OFF. - WAIT TILL YOU HEAR WHAT'S ON THE FLIP SIDE. ♪ OH, WE GOT BEAT, IT AIN'T NO TREAT ♪ - KNOCK IT OFF. - WELL, WELL, I SEE THE JET FROM HEAVEN JUST LANDED. ANGEL, HAVE I ASKED YOU TO GO TO THE GAME WITH ME? - TWICE. - WHAT DID YOU SAY? - NO. NO. - OH. OH. - BUT YOU CAN BUY ME A SODA IF YOU LIKE. - OH, I'M BROKE. BUT I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU WANTED ME TO. - ALL THROUGH WITH THESE, BOYS? - CHARLIE, YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS. WHAT WAS IT LIKE WHEN CENTRAL BEAT WEBSTER? - TERRIFIC. WHAT A PARTY WE HAD HERE. I GAVE EVERYBODY A SODA ON THE HOUSE. - YEAH. WELL, DON'T WORRY, YOU WON'T HAVE TO DO THAT AGAIN. - WORRY? IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE. FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. WE'VE HAD GOOD TEAMS. WE BEAT OTHER SCHOOLS, BUT EVERY TIME WE MEET WEBSTER WE SEEM TO BE JINXED. THEY'VE GOT THE INDIAN SIGN ON US. WHY WE CAN'T GET THE INDIAN SIGN ON THEM? - YOU KNOW, CHARLIE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING THERE. BUT WITH THEIR LUCK, HOW WE ARE GOING TO PUT AN INDIAN SIGN ON THEM? - MAYBE LIKE GETTING A BLACK CAT TO DIVE IN THEIR WATER BUCKET. - WAIT A MINUTE. I JUST GOT A FLASH. FELLOWS, SUMMIT MEETING. - WHAT'S THE FLASH, DOBIE? - JUST BEFORE THE GAME, WHAT DOES EVERY WEBSTER PLAYER RUB HIS HANDS OVER? - THEIR MASCOT'S HEAD. - RIGHT. THEY FIGURE THAT'S WHAT BRINGING THEM LUCK, RUBBING THEIR HANDS OVER THE GOAT'S HEAD. SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO? - CUT OFF THEIR HANDS. - WE'RE GOING TO STEAL THEIR GOAT. - DOBIE, I BOW TO GENIUS. WITHOUT THEIR MASCOT, THEIR GOOD LUCK CHARM, THEIR MORALE WILL BE SHATTERED. - OH, SLOW DOWN, CATS. UNWIND. SOME FELLOWS TRIED THAT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, AND THOSE WEBSTER GUYS CAUGHT 'EM AND CLOBBERED 'EM. - SURE. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE CLUMSY. THEY BUNGLED THE JOB. NOW, WE'RE GONNA CASE THE SETUP AND PLAN EVERY ANGLE, SPLIT SECOND TIMING, ORGANIZATION. I'M TELLING YOU WE'VE CLEVER ENOUGH TO PULL THIS CAPER OFF WITHOUT A HITCH. - IF WE'RE THAT CLEVER, LET'S FORGET THE GOAT AND, LIKE, KNOCK OVER A BANK. - THIS IS NO TIME FOR CLOWNING, CLOWN. - NOW NOW, LOOK. THEY KEEP THE GOAT IN THEIR AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT, RIGHT HERE. AND THEY'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF GUYS GUARDING IT. NOW, WE'LL GO OVER AND CASE THE PLACE THIS AFTERNOON. THEN TONIGHT I'LL GET MY FATHER'S CAR AND WE'LL PARK IT OVER HERE ON THE BACK ROAD. I FIGURE THE BEST TIME TO STRIKE'S AROUND 10:00. [ GATE SQUEAKS ] - WHAT WAS THAT? - TURN THAT THING OFF, I CAN'T HEAR. I THOUGHT I HEARD A NOISE. I BETTER GO CHECK. - SIT DOWN, YOU CAN CHECK LATER. COME ON, IT'S YOUR TURN. IT'S PROBABLY THE GOAT. - HOW YOU DOING? - WORKING LIKE A CHARM. - CRAZY, THAT CARROT BIT. - GOT IT MADE. - OH, YOU HOOKED HIM. REEL HIM IN. YOU GOT, LIKE, JUST STRING, MAN. THE GOAT'S GOT THE CARROT. - LUCKY WE PLANNED FOR SUCH AN EMERGENCY. GIVE ME THE OTHER CARROT. I SAID GIVE ME THE OTHER CARROT. THE OTHER CARROT, WHERE IS IT? - I ATE IT. - I'M NOT MENTIONING ANY NAMES, BUT SOMEBODY GOOFED. WE HAVE TO GO ONTO PLAN NUMBER 2, GWENDOLYN. - OKAY, HORTENSE. HORTENSE, ARE YOU SURE THE FELLOWS SAID THEY'D MEET US HERE? - YES. SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED TO THEM, GWENDOLYN. - MAYBE THEY COULDN'T GET THE CAR. - WHAT A SHAME. AND IT'S SUCH A LOVELY NIGHT. - WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? - I'LL TAKE HORTENSE. I LOVE THOSE CHICKS WITH THE LOW-PITCHED VOICE. - THIS YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO BRING US LUCK. - I STILL DON'T SEE WHY WE GOTTA KEEP HIM IN MY ROOM. THIS AIN'T NO STABLE. - MAYNARD... - WE COULD CLEAN IT UP AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ONE. - WHY DON'T WE, LIKE, KEEP IT IN YOUR ROOM, OR YOUR ROOM? - BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR ROOMS IN THE HOUSE. YOU'VE GOT YOUR OWN PRIVATE ROOM OUT IN BACK HERE. - I THINK I'M GOING TO WRITE THE MAYOR ABOUT THIS PLACE SO HE CAN TEAR IT DOWN AND PUT UP A SLUM. - PLEASE. THIS ROOM REFLECTS MY PERSONALITY, AND I AIN'T PUTTING ANY GOAT IN HERE. - MAYNARD, LOOK AT THAT BRUSH. HOW CAN YOU TURN AWAY A FELLOW BEATNIK? AND BESIDES, IT'S FOR GOOD OLD CENTRAL. - I'M, LIKE, TOUCHED. HE STAYS. - GOOD MAN. FELLOWS, WE'RE ALL TO BE CONGRATULATED. - A JOB WELL DONE. - YEAH. YOU KNOW, I KIND OF FEEL SORRY FOR THOSE GUARDS. I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE THEM WHEN THE SCHOOL FINDS OUT THE MASCOT'S MISSING. - SAVE YOUR SYMPATHY, BOY. REMEMBER, THEY'RE WEBSTERITES. - YEAH. NOW... - [ CRUNCHING ] HEY! AH, THIS CAT'S EATING ONE OF MY RECORDS. A STAN KENTON RECORD. LOOK, BIG DADDY, IF THIS STUFF'S IN YOUR REGULAR DIET, I'LL GET YOU, LIKE, A WHOLE STACK OF LAWRENCE WELK, HUH? - NOW, LOOK, FELLAS. WE'VE GOT TO PLAY THIS COOL AND CAUTIOUS. NOT A WORD TO ANYBODY THAT WE'VE PULLED A CAPER. - WHY SHOULDN'T WE TAKE CREDIT? - WE'LL TAKE CREDIT AFTER THE GAME. IF WE START POPPING OFF NOW, SOMEBODY'S LIABLE TO BLAB, AND WORD WILL GET BACK TO WEBSTER. - SO? - SO IF THEY KNOW WE DID IT, THEY'LL COME LOOKING FOR US, TRY TO MAKE US TALK, TELL THEM WHERE WE HID THE GOAT. - BEAT ME, WHIP ME, STICK PINS IN ME. I'M HUSH-HUSH. - MY LIPS ARE SEALED. - WE'LL TAKE A PLEDGE. WE SOLEMNLY SWEAR NOT TO TELL A LIVING SOUL THAT WE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE KIDNAPPING OF THE GOAT. NOT A WORD TO ANYONE. [ GOAT BAA-ING ] AND YOU KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT TOO. - HEY, FELLAS, HAVE YOU HEARD THE NEWS? - WHAT NEWS? - WEBSTER'S MASCOT IS MISSING. SOMEBODY STOLE THE GOAT. - WHO COULD HAVE PERPETRATED A DASTARDLY CRIME LIKE THAT? - MY, MY, DELINQUENCY IS RAMPANT. - YEAH. - HEY, YOU GUYS FLIPPED OR SOMETHING? DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? THIS WILL BREAK THEIR LUCKY STREAK. WITHOUT THEIR MASCOT, THEY'LL BE NOTHING. - COOL, MAN.

MAYNARD, THE PLEDGE. - I'M WITH IT. - WELL, STAY WITH IT. - IMAGINE, STEALING THEIR MASCOT. - I WONDER WHO DID IT? - I DON'T KNOW, BUT WHOEVER IT WAS, WHAT A MAN. - OH, YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN. - YOU KNOW HOW CLOSELY THEY GUARD THAT MASCOT. WHOEVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO STEAL IT MUST HAVE BEEN A GENIUS. - LOLA, HAVE YOU HEARD? - HAVE I? WHY, THE WHOLE SCHOOL'S BUZZING ABOUT IT. ISN'T IT THE DREAMIEST? - WELL, DO YOU KNOW WHO DID IT? - NO. BUT I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO FIND OUT. HE'D BE MY KIND OF MAN. A MAN OF INGENUITY, DASHING, DAUNTLESS, FEARLESS. - WHAT A DATE. - I'D GO OUT WITH HIM EVEN IF HE DIDN'T HAVE A CAR. - A CAR?

GIRLS, LUSCIOUS, CREAMY CREATURES. YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT GIRLS. - THE SAME WAY I FEEL ABOUT STAN KENTON. - MAYNARD, DON'T A GIRL'S LIPS MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? - IF THEY CAN PLAY A HOT TRUMPET, I'LL LISTEN. I'LL LISTEN. - FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE I CAN HAVE MY PICK. FAT LOT OF GOOD IT DOES ME. HERE I AM, DASHING, DAUNTLESS, FEARLESS, A HERO ON A WHITE HORSE. - YOU AT LEAST GOT A WHITE HORSE. I'M STUCK WITH A GOAT. - BUT DIDN'T YOU GET A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT ANY OF THEM LOOKED LIKE? - WELL, IT HAPPENED SO FAST. WE WENT OUT TO MAKE TIME WITH THESE CHICKS, YOU SEE. - CHICKS?

THE ONLY BRAIN MAYNARD'S GOT IS DOBIE GILLIS, HIS SIDEKICK. - OKAY. LET'S ROUND UP THE FELLAS AND MOVE IN ON THEM. - HOLD IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE PRINCIPAL SAID ABOUT ROUGH STUFF. - I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY VIOLENCE WHATSOEVER IN THE MASCOT INCIDENT. - BESIDES, GIVING THEM THEIR LUMPS ISN'T GOING TO GET OUR MASCOT BACK. WHAT WE HAVE TO FIND OUT IS WHERE THEY HAVE THE GOAT STASHED AWAY. - YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. AT LEAST WE KNOW WHO ENGINEERED IT. NOW WE HAVE TO GET THEM TO TALK, BUT HOW? - I'VE GOT IT.
