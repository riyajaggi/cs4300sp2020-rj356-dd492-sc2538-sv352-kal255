 THE VERY THOUGHT OF HER FILLS MY HEART WITH SWEET TENDER MEMORIES. SHE MAKES ME THINK OF LOVELY SOFT MUSIC. - [ SCATTING ] - MAYNARD! MAYNARD, GEE, YOU LOOK GREAT. WELL, BUT YOU CAN'T BE HERE, YOU'RE IN THE ARMY. - NO, GOOD BUDDY. THEY KIND OF LET ME GO. - YOU MEAN A FURLOUGH? - NO. THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE IT. - A DISCHARGE? - THAT WAS IN THERE SOMEWHERE. - WHAT KIND OF DISCHARGE? - THEY CALLED IT A HARDSHIP DISCHARGE. - WHOSE HARDSHIP? YOURS? YOUR PARENTS? - NO, THE ARMY'S. - WELL, ARE YOU GOING BACK? - I DON'T KNOW, MAN. THEY SAID, LIKE, DON'T CALL US, WE'LL CALL YOU. - IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, MAYNARD. YOU LOOK GREAT, WONDERFUL. - YEAH. YOU LOOK SICK. - NO. I'M FINE. IT'S JUST THAT, WELL, I'M IN LOVE. - YEAH, I WAS RIGHT. - I CAN'T EXPECT YOU TO UNDERSTAND, NOT UNTIL YOU'VE BEEN IN LOVE YOURSELF. - OH, NO. YOU DON'T CATCH ME TRAVELING THAT ROUTE. - JUST WAIT. YOUR FINGERS WILL CARESS HERS, THE WORLD WILL STAND STILL, YOU'LL HEAR GENTLE MUSIC, LIKE AN ANGEL STRUMMING A HEAVENLY HARP. LISTEN. [ HARP MUSIC ] [ HARP MUSIC ] - OH, YOU GOT IT BAD. I DON'T HEAR NOTHING. HEY, WHAT SAY WE ANKLE IT DOWN TO THE RECORD STORE FOR SOME PLATTERS WITH A REAL BEAT, HUH? - NOT ME, THANKS. I'VE GOT A DATE WITH HER. - GEE, I HOPE YOU'RE BETTER REAL SOON. - OH, I'M SORRY, IT WAS ALL MY FAULT. - OH, IT'S BROKEN. - YOUR ANKLE? - NO, MY RADIO. I GOT TWO ANKLES. - PLEASE, CAN I HAVE IT FIXED FOR YOU? - AND IT PLAYED REAL COOL UNTIL... [ HARP MUSIC ] - YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE NOT HURT? YOU'RE VERY SWEET NOT TO BE ANGRY WITH ME ABOUT THIS. YOU'RE VERY NICE TO BE SO VERY NICE ABOUT THIS. DOBIE. - PEARL, MY SWEET. - DOBIE, MY LOVE. - YEAH. I PICKED THESE JUST FOR YOU. - OH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. - HERBERT, YOU JUST DON'T GIVE DOBIE A CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF. HE'S REALLY A FINE BOY. - A BOY WHAT? WINNIE, HE DOESN'T KNOW THE MEANING OF THE WORD WORK. MONEY, ALLOWANCE, SPENDING, THESE WORDS HE KNOWS. SO WHY CAN'T HE UNDERSTAND WORK? - HE'S TOO BUSY DISCOVERING LIFE. PUT YOURSELF IN HIS PLACE. HE'S YOUNG. - LET HIM PUT HIMSELF IN MY PLACE. I'M OLD. IS IT SO WRONG FOR ME TO WANT MY SON TO PITCH IN AND HELP? MY BACK ACHES. MY ARCHES ARE COLLAPSING. - WHY HERBERT, YOU'RE NOT OLD. YOU'RE JUST AS STRONG AND HANDSOME AS THE DAY WE WERE MARRIED. - BALONEY. - WHAT? - BOLOGNA, MRS. SCHULTZ'S ORDER. - OH. - PARDON ME, JULIET, BUT ROMEO MUST AWAY TO THE FREEZER AND GRIND SOME MEAT. PARTING IS SUCH SWEET SORROW BUT MRS. SCHULTZ'S GROUND ROUND WON'T WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW. - HI MOM. - OH, HELLO DEAR. - BOY, WHAT A DAY. I HAVE FINALLY DISCOVERED THE TRUE MEANING OF LIFE. - WELL, THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING DISCOVERY, DEAR. WHAT'S HER NAME? - PEARL ARNOLD. AND I HAVE A DATE WITH HER TONIGHT. SAY, MOM, YOU THINK DAD WILL LET ME GO OUT? HE'S BEEN DOING A LOT OF YELLING LATELY. - OH, THAT'S JUST AN ACT. HE REALLY LOVES YOU VERY MUCH. JUST PROVE THAT YOU LOVE HIM. MAYBE IF YOU WERE A LITTLE MORE HELPFUL AROUND THE STORE. - WELL, I AM HELPFUL. I DO EVERYTHING HE TELLS ME, LIKE ALWAYS SAYING THANK YOU TO THE CUSTOMERS, AND CLOSING THE FREEZER DOOR IF I FIND IT OPEN. - THAT'S FINE, DEAR. YOUR FATHER WILL BE VERY... - DOBIE, THAT WAS YOU THAT CLOSED THE FREEZER DOOR? - IT SURE WAS. HE'LL LIKE THAT, HUH? MOM... BYE, MOM. - I G-G-GOTTA KILL THAT BOY. I JUST G-GOTTA. - THE WORST PART IS, HE WON'T LET ME GO OUT ON A DATE FOR A WHOLE MONTH. I CAN'T SEE HER TONIGHT. - HEY, WHY DON'T YOU, LIKE, JUST SNEAK OUT? - NO. MY DAD'S A CINCH TO STICK HIS HEAD IN THERE TO MAKE SURE I'M IN BED. - LOOKS LIKE DOOMSVILLE FOR YOU AND THE CHICK. - YEAH. WAIT, MAYBE I COULD DIG UP SOMEBODY TO TAKE MY PLACE UNDER THE COVERS. - CRAZY. ONE BUNCH OF LUMPS LOOKS LIKE ANY OTHER BUNCH OF LUMPS. - YEAH. HE'D NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE. - MAN, WE ARE WINGING. - YEAH. BE THERE BY 8:30. - ME? OH, DADDY-O, I CAN'T... - UNDER THE COVERS YOU'LL LOOK LIKE ANY OTHER BUNCH OF LUMPS. - SURE, BUT I-I-I... - YOU WHAT, PAL? - I-I, LIKE, SHOOT OPEN MY MOUTH TOO MUCH. - HI, MAYNARD. WHAT'S THAT? - SNACKS. THE ONLY THING I'VE EATEN SINCE LUNCH WAS DINNER. - I WISH I COULD SHOW MY APPRECIATION FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING FOR ME TONIGHT. - YEAH, I KNOW A WAY. - YEAH? - ASK YOUR MOTHER FOR SOME MUSTARD, I FORGOT MINE. - I CAN'T DO THAT. THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW YOU'RE HERE. - GOOD THING I BROUGHT MY EXTRA KETCHUP. - JUST MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN BED IN CASE MY FATHER COMES IN. - WHY WAIT? - WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, WINNIE. - I KNOW I'M RIGHT. IF YOU JUST SIT DOWN WITH DOBIE AND HAVE A GOOD MAN-TO-MAN TALK, I'M SURE EVERYTHING WILL BE CLEARED UP IN A JIFFY. LET THE BOY KNOW THAT YOU CARE ABOUT HIS PROBLEMS. MAKE HIM FEEL THAT YOU'RE HIS FRIEND. - ALL RIGHT, WINNIE. ALL RIGHT. I'LL DO IT. - WHEN? - ONE OF THESE DAYS. - WHICH ONE? - THIS ONE. DOBIE? ARE YOU UP? SON? I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME FOR YOU AND I TO HAVE A LITTLE MAN-TO-MAN TALK. I WANT YOU TO FEEL FREE TO COME TO ME IF ANYTHING IS WRONG. IF YOU'RE IN TROUBLE, JUST SAY THE WORD AND I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP. YOU BETTER HAVE THE SCHOOL DOCTOR LOOK INTO THIS NERVOUS CONDITION OF YOURS. AFTER ALL, IT MAY BE THE COMPANY YOU KEEP. YOU KNOW, THAT SPOOKY CLOWN, MAYNARD, WOULD GIVE ANYBODY THE CREEPS. WELL, I FEEL OUR LITTLE TALK HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL. LET'S SHAKE ON US HAVING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US IN THE FUTURE, HUH? NO ONE CAN SAY I DIDN'T TRY. - MAYNARD? MAYNARD, WAKE UP. - MAN, I DIDN'T GET ANY SLEEP AT ALL LAST NIGHT. YOU KEPT MOANING AND YELLING, PEARL, PEARL. - YEAH. IT WAS ONLY THE GREATEST. - DID YOUR FATHER SAY ANYTHING THIS MORNING? - NOT A WORD. HE JUST SAT THERE AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE STARING AT ME AND LICKING HIS HAND. - PARENTS. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? - YEAH. PAL, NOW IT'S MY TURN TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOU. JUST NAME IT. - WELL, I... NO, WHAT'S THE USE? - NO. GO ON, TELL ME. - YOU SEE, I... NO.

I'LL TEACH YOU ALL THE TRICKS I KNOW ABOUT THE FEMALE OF THE SPECIES. - NEGATIVE. CHICKS LIKE TO BE SWEET-TALKED, AND I'M NOT BUILT FOR THAT KIND OF ACTION. LET'S DROP IT. - NO. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT TO SAY AND HOW TO SAY IT. - I'D BE, LIKE, BATTING OUT OF MY LEAGUE. - OH, NO. NOT WITH YOUR CYRANO DE BERGERAC AT YOUR SIDE. - CYRANO DE WHOGERAC? - DE BERGERAC. THE FRENCHMAN WE STUDIED ABOUT IN LITERATURE CLASS WITH THE LONG NOSE. HE TAUGHT HIS FRIEND HOW TO MAKE LOVE TO A GIRL AND IT WORKED LIKE THAT. - YEAH. I MUST HAVE SLEPT THAT SEMESTER. - HIS FRIEND WAS KIND OF SLOW, SEE? NOTHING PERSONAL, MAYNARD. AND CYRANO COACHED HIM FROM THE SIDELINES. HE TOLD HIM ALL THE ROMANTIC THINGS TO SAY THAT LET HIM IN ON THE SECRETS OF HIGH-CLASS WOO PITCHING. MADE A REAL LOVER OUT OF A WASHOUT. HE... NOTHING PERSONAL, MAYNARD. - YOU THINK I COULD DO IT? - ABSOLUTELY. - YEAH. MAYBE SHE... OH, NAW, I'D FLUB IT. - OH, NOT IF I HELP YOU. WE'LL HAVE THAT POOR GIRL APE OVER YOU. - YEAH? - YEAH. YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGHT HER OFF. - MAN. NO, WHY KID MYSELF. I'M JUST NOT THE ROMANTIC TYPE. - NOW, MAYNARD, DON'T ARGUE. I'M TAKING OVER.

HE'S KIND OF AN INSPIRATION TO ME, WHICH IS WHY I COME HERE TO THINK WHENEVER I HAVE A PROBLEM, LIKE NOW. YOU SEE, I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF THINKING ABOUT ME AND PEARL AND MAYNARD, AND I'VE REACHED AN IMPORTANT DECISION. I'M GOING TO GIVE UP THINKING. I MEAN, WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO? HERE I'VE BEEN THINKING MY HEAD DOWN TO THE BONE FOR AN HOUR NOW, AND I STILL CAN'T DECIDE BETWEEN LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP. IT'S LIKE THAT FELLOW CYRANO I WAS TELLING MAYNARD ABOUT. YOU KNOW, THE ROMANTIC FRENCHMAN WITH THE LONG NOSE. HE PROMISED TO HELP HIS BACKWARD FRIEND MAKE TIME WITH A GIRL, AND THEN IT TURNS OUT THAT HE'S IN LOVE WITH THE SAME GIRL. BUT WHAT CAN HE DO? HE'S SLICK, SUAVE, AND HE'S A SMASH WITH THE WOMEN, BUT HE'S ALSO VERY LOYAL AND UNSELFISH. A PRINCE OF A FELLOW. KIND OF LIKE, WELL, LET'S FACE IT, ME. DEAR FRIEND. - DEAR FRIEND. CYRANO, WHEN THE FAIR PEARL ARRIVES, YOU MUST, LIKE, SHOW ME HOW TO WOO HER, ELSE I AM LOST. - HAVE NO FEAR, DEAR FRIEND. I AM AT THY SIDE. AH, THE LADY COMETH. - WE ARE ALONE. SPEAK TO ME OF LOVE. - DEAR ONE, MY THOUGHTS OF YOU, LIKE, SOAR AS IF ON THE WINGS OF A DOVE. - OH, YES. SPEAK MORE, I PRAY YOU. - LOVELY PEARL, YOUR NAME IS TO MY HEART AS THE GOLDEN PEALING OF A BELL. - YES, YES. GO ON. - YOUR GRACE IS SHEER MUSIC, A HYMN TO, LIKE, ALL BEAUTY. - YES. YES. - TO ME, YOUR VOICE IS A CHEESY GARGLING OF A CROWING SCREAM. THE EASY FLOWING OF A GURGLING STREAM. - YOU HAVE MADE ME THE HAPPIEST OF WOMEN. LET US AWAY TO THE ARBOR. - YES. IT IS A FAR, FAR BETTER THING I DO THAN I HAVE EVER DONE. SOMEHOW I'VE GOT TO GET RID OF PEARL, FOR MAYNARD. FOR MY BUDDY. - DOBIE, MY OWN. - PEARL... PEARL, PLEASE, PLEASE RESTRAIN YOURSELF. - SOMETHING'S THE MATTER. - WELL, YEAH. - YOU DON'T LIKE MY NEW HAIRDO. OH, I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET MY SISTER FOOL WITH IT. SHE'S BEEN PRACTICING ON THE POODLE. - OH, YOUR HAIR, IT'S-IT'S MOONLIGHT. - MY PERFUME IS TOO STRONG? - OH, NO.

DOBE, I COULDN'T FIGURE WHERE YOU SNUCK OFF TO. - WELL, I HAD SOME SOUL SEARCHING TO DO, BUT I WORKED THINGS OUT. MAYNARD, OLD FRIEND, I REALIZE NOW THAT YOUR FRIENDSHIP IS MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION.
