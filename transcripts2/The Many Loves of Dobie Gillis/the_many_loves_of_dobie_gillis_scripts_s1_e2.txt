 The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis (1959–1963): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Best Dressed Man - full transcript 
 Dobie launches a runway offensive versus wealthy, better-dressed hunk Milton Armitage, his competitor for luscious teen gold-digger Thalia Menninger. When Dobie's grocer father Herbert T. Gillis refuses to finance a clothing binge, Dobie talks a local haberdasher into letting Dobie secretly model the shoppe's best outfits, to promote the store's business, plus counter Maynard & The Beat Generation's anti-fashion values, which challenge 50's Mad Men mores.

HE DON'T WANT WORK. WHAT'S HARD TO UNDERSTAND? - BUT YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW HARD IT IS TO BE A 17-YEAR-OLD. - I KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S EVEN HARDER. - WHAT? - TO BE THE FATHER OF A 17-YEAR-OLD.

I WANT THE CLOTHES FOR ME. THALIA THINKS CLOTHES ARE A WHOLE BIG DEAL. YOU REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID TO MILTON YESTERDAY. - YEAH. - WHO AM I KIDDING? I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD CLOTHES LIKE THESE. WITHOUT CLOTHES LIKE THESE, I'LL NEVER GET THALIA. - OH, IT'S, LIKE, TOUGH, BUDDY. - YEAH. - SONNY? - ME? - YOU. - WHAT? - WOULD YOU MIND MOVING ON? - HOW COME? - WELL, NO OFFENSE, SONNY, BUT THIS IS A CLOTHING STORE AND I'D HATE TO HAVE ANYONE THINK THAT YOU JUST CAME OUT OF HERE. - PLEASE DON'T KNOCK MY CLOTHES, MISTER. I'M A SYMPTOM. - OF WHAT? - OF THE BEAT GENERATION. [ SCATS ] - OH, YOU BEATNIKS. YOU KNOW, I AIN'T SOLD SO MUCH AS A PAIR OF SOCKS TO A HIGH SCHOOL KID SINCE I DON'T KNOW WHEN. - THAT'S RIGHT! - WHAT'S RIGHT? - WHAT YOU SAID. YOU'RE NOT SELLING ANY CLOTHES TO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS. - HE'S TELLING ME I'M NOT SELLING. USED TO BE A KID WOULD COME IN THE STORE ONCE IN A WHILE AND BUY A SUIT, A JACKET, A SHIRT. NOW EVERYBODY'S THE BEAT GENERATION. - THAT'S RIGHT. - THAT'S RIGHT, HE'S TELLING ME. - WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT? - WHAT CAN I DO? CALL THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT? - YOU CAN FIGHT. - LIKE HOW? - YEAH, LIKE HOW? - LOOK, HERE'S THE ENEMY, TRUE? - POISON. - YEAH, YEAH, POISON. AND FOR POISON, YOU NEED AN ANTIDOTE. - LIKE WHAT? - YEAH, LIKE WHAT? - LIKE ME. - I DON'T, LIKE, DIG. - I DON'T, LIKE... WILL YOU SHUT UP? - WHAT YOU NEED IS A REPRESENTATIVE OVER AT THE SCHOOL, SOMEBODY WHO'D SHOW UP EVERY DAY IN BEAUTIFUL NEW CLOTHES. SOMEBODY WHO'LL EXCITE THE ENVY AND ADMIRATION OF ALL THE OTHER GUYS. AND THE FIRST THING YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WILL BE FLOCKING DOWN TO ZIEGLER'S. - YOU THINK SO? - I KNOW SO. PROVIDED, OF COURSE, YOU GET THE RIGHT REPRESENTATIVE. I MEAN, YOU WANT SOME REALLY PROMINENT STUDENT, SOME NATURAL-BORN LEADER, YOU MIGHT SAY. - YOU, FOR INSTANCE? - WELL, IT WOULDN'T BE FITTING FOR ME TO SAY. ASK, UH... ASK MAYNARD. - THERE'S A RELIABLE WITNESS. - NOW SERIOUSLY, MR. ZIEGLER. IF YOU JUST GAVE ME A CHANCE... - SAVE IT, SON, SAVE IT. - YOU MEAN YOU WON'T? - I MEAN I WILL. MY BOY, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A DESPERATE MAN. I HAVEN'T MOVED A TEENAGE ITEM SINCE CHRISTMAS. - AW, YOU'LL NEVER REGRET THIS, MR. ZIEGLER. - I'M REGRETTING IT ALREADY. BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOUR BACK IS AGAINST THE WALL? WELL, COME ON IN, SONNY. I'LL DRESS YOU. PLEASE, SONNY, NOT YOU. - YEAH, MAYNARD, YOU GET OVER TO THE SCHOOL AND FIND THALIA. AND HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO TELL HER. - LIKE, HI. - HI. - DON'T YOU THINK A WELL-DRESSED MAN IS, LIKE, THE GREATEST? - WHO'D YOU HAVE IN MIND? LIKE, NOBODY. I MEAN, JUST A WELL-DRESSED MAN LIKE, IN GENERAL. - YES. - YES, WHAT? - YES, I THINK A WELL-DRESSED MAN IS, LIKE, THE GREATEST. - YEAH. I MEAN, A MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE IS, LIKE, IMPORTANT. DON'T YOU THINK SO? - OH, I THINK SO. - I MEAN, IF I WAS A GIRL, I'D REALLY FLIP FOR A WELL-DRESSED MAN. WOULDN'T YOU? - I CERTAINLY WOULD. GOOD MORNING, MILTON. - GOOD MORNING, MOUSE. - OH, WHAT A BEAUTIFUL SUIT! - THANK YOU. IT'S MOHAIR FROM REAL GOATS. - OH, THINK OF THAT. - IT'S A FAIR SUIT, FAIR. - I'D LIKE TO SEE A BETTER ONE AROUND HERE. - MM, SO WOULD I. - SO LOOK. - GOOD MORNING, CHAPS. - HEY, THAT'S, LIKE, A GREAT SUIT, DOBIE. - THIS OLD THING? THIS OLD LIGHTWEIGHT, ALL-WEATHER, ALL-PURPOSE CASHMERE? - YEAH, THAT AIN'T MADE OUT OF ANY OLD GOAT HAIR, I BET YOU. - DOBIE, IT'S BEAUTIFUL. MAY I FEEL IT? - IF YOU LIKE. - OH, DOBIE! - OH, IT'S JUST A LITTLE OLD LIGHTWEIGHT, ALL-WEATHER, ALL-PURPOSE WRINKLE-RESISTANT CASHMERE. - WELL, IF I WAS, LIKE, A GIRL, I'D SURE WANT TO BE SEEN AROUND TOWN WITH A GUY WHO LOOKED LIKE DOBIE. - OH, ME TOO. HEY, YOU WANNA MEET AT THE ICE CREAM PARLOR AFTER SCHOOL TODAY? - OH, I DON'T KNOW. - DUTCH TREAT? - OH, I DON'T KNOW. - I'LL BUY. - OH, VERY WELL. - BUT, THALIA, YOU PROMISED ME. - OH, SOME OTHER TIME, MILTIE. - HEY, MAYBE YOU AND I CAN DO SOMETHING TOGETHER, BIG DADDY. - WELL, SIR, FOR A WHILE THERE, I WAS THE BEST-DRESSED MAN WHO EVER HIT CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL. I MEAN, EVERY DAY ANOTHER NEW OUTFIT. WHAT I'D DO IS STOP AT MR. ZIEGLER'S CLOTHING STORE EVERY MORNING ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL AND HE'D DECK ME OUT IN BRAND NEW CLOTHES. MAN, THEY WERE THE END. OF COURSE, I'D HAVE TO BRING THEM BACK EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL, BUT THEY REALLY MADE AN IMPRESSION, ESPECIALLY ON THALIA. MAN, I THOUGHT SHE'D LOSE HER EVER-LOVING MIND. AS FOR MILTON ARMITAGE, WELL, I GOT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT. HE DIDN'T TAKE THIS LYING DOWN. NO, SIR, HE FOUGHT BACK. EVERY TIME I CAME IN WITH A NEW OUTFIT, BY GEORGE, HE DID ME ONE BETTER. BUT I FOUGHT BACK TOO. I DID HIM ONE BETTER. AND, AFTER ALL, IN A TEST LIKE THIS, I HAD TO BE THE WINNER. I MEAN, MILTON MIGHT HAVE A CLOSET 16 FEET LONG, BUT MR. ZIEGLER HAD A CLOTHING STORE 125 FEET LONG. FOR A WHILE, MILTON KEPT TOPPING ME, BUT I'D TOP HIM RIGHT BACK. - GREAT SUIT, DOBIE. THEN FINALLY THERE CAME A DAY WHEN I TOPPED HIM FOR GOOD AND ALL. MR. ZIEGLER TOOK EXTRA PAINS THAT DAY, SO I WAS A LITTLE LATE GETTING TO CLASS. - HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE GLASSES? - I WANNA GET A GOOD LOOK. OH, I WONDER WHAT THEY'LL BE WEARING TODAY. ISN'T THIS EXCITING? - YEAH, COOL, MOTHER. - OH, HERE COMES MILTON! OH, I THINK I SHALL SWOON! - DARLING. - OH! OH, MILTON, THESE ARE THE UTMOST. I MEAN, THEY'RE THE LIVING, BREATHING END. - YOU'RE RIGHT, THALIA. IT IS THE END. THIS IS AS FAR AS I GO. THIS, IN FACT, IS AS FAR AS ANYBODY GOES. THESE, THALIA, ARE THE ULTIMATE CLOTHES. - YES, YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. - SO HOW ABOUT MAKING UP YOUR MIND? ARE YOU MY GIRL OR AREN'T YOU? - WELL, I'LL HAVE TO SEE WHAT DOBIE HAS ON FIRST. - COULD HE POSSIBLY DO BETTER THAN THIS? - IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY. - WELL, THEN? - WELL, LET'S JUST WAIT AND SEE. - MORNING, CLASS. - MORNING. - WHERE'S THE OTHER FOP? NOT HERE YET? WHAT A PITY. WE'LL HAVE TO BEGIN WITHOUT HIM. PLEASE TURN TO PAGE 476, "KUBLA KHAN" BY SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, LAST STANZA. YOU KNOW, SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, WHO WROTE THIS POEM, WAS A KIND OF AN INTERESTING OLD GUY. HE HAD HALLUCINATIONS. THAT IS, HE SAW THINGS WHICH DIDN'T EXIST. I'M BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE FELT. ALL RIGHT, "KUBLA KHAN," LAST STANZA. "COULD I REVIVE WITHIN ME HER SYMPHONY AND SONG, "TO SUCH A DEEP DELIGHT 'TWOULD WIN ME, "THAT WITH MUSIC LOUD AND LONG, "I WOULD BUILD THAT DOME IN AIR, "THAT SUNNY DOME! THOSE CAVES OF ICE! "AND ALL WHO HEARD SHOULD SEE THEM THERE AND ALL SHOULD CRY BEWARE! BEWARE!" - THALIA, DARLING. - WILL YOU STOP READING OTHER PEOPLE'S MAIL? - MILTON, PLEASE, CALM YOURSELF. - WELL, YOU'VE JUST GOT TO, MR. ZIEGLER. YOU GOT TO. - GOT TO WHAT? - YOU KNOW THE JACKET THAT DOBIE GILLIS HAD ON YESTERDAY? - YEAH. - WELL, YOU'VE GOTTA SELL ME A BETTER ONE. - MY BOY, THERE'S NO SUCH THING. THIS IS AS GOOD AS JACKETS GET. - WELL, HAVE YOU GOT ONE LIKE IT? - OF COURSE, MY BOY, OF COURSE. HERE WE ARE. THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL JACKET. NOW YOU TRY THIS ON. - IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE SNUG, ISN'T IT? - OH, SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? WE'LL LET THE SEAMS OUT A LITTLE HERE AND HERE AND IT'LL FIT YOU LIKE A DREAM. DON'T WORRY. - GEE, I DON'T KNOW. IT'S, UH... WHAT'S THIS? - OH, I DON'T KNOW. A TAG FROM THE MANUFACTURER, MAYBE. - NO, NO. THAT'S A NOTE FROM THALIA MENNINGER TO DOBIE GILLIS. HOW DID IT GET IN THIS POCKET? - ISN'T THAT FUNNY? WELL, MILTON, I'LL CALL THE TAILOR AND WE'LL START MEASURING THE JACKET. - HEY, HAVEN'T I SEEN THIS JACKET ON DOBIE GILLIS? AND THIS ONE? AND THIS ONE? YEAH, AND THIS ONE. AND THIS ONE. - IT'S POSSIBLE, MILTON. HE'S A VERY GOOD CUSTOMER, YOU KNOW. - CUSTOMER, MY EYE. HE'S A SHILL. - OH, NO, MILTON. HE'S MORE LIKE AN ADVERTISING REPRESENTATIVE. - NOW I'VE GOT HIM. - OH, LOOK, MILTON. YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET ME IN ANY TROUBLE, ARE YOU? - NOT YOU, MR. ZIEGLER, NOT YOU. SO HE NEVER OWNED A SINGLE ONE OF THOSE SUITS, NOT ONE. HE WAS JUST KIND OF A WALKING BILLBOARD FOR ZIEGLER. HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT? - I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT VERY MUCH. - OKAY, YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. HE DIDN'T OWN THOSE SUITS. I OWN MINE. - YES, I KNOW, MILTON, AND I THINK IT'S VERY NICE. I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING AS IMPORTANT IN A MAN AS MONEY, IS THERE? - WELL, I'M LOADED. - WELL, YES, AND THAT'S WHY I'VE BEEN SO INTERESTED IN YOU. BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING I INTEND TO HAVE, IT'S A RICH HUSBAND. BUT IT'S NOT FOR MYSELF, YOU UNDERSTAND. MY FATHER IS 60 YEARS OLD AND HAS A KIDNEY CONDITION AND MY MOTHER ISN'T GETTING ANY YOUNGER EITHER. ALSO, I'VE GOT A SISTER WHO'S MARRIED TO A LOAFER AND, OH, MY BROTHER, HE SHOWS EVERY SIGN OF TURNING INTO A PUBLIC CHARGE. SO IT'S UP TO ME, YOU SEE. I'VE GOT AN OBLIGATION TO MY FAMILY. AND WHEN YOU'RE AS BEAUTIFUL AND INTELLIGENT AS I AM... - OH, YOU ARE, YOU ARE. - NOW, PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT WHEN I'M TALKING. - SORRY. - I SAID WHEN YOU'RE AS BEAUTIFUL AND INTELLIGENT AS I AM, IT'S SELFISH JUST TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I WANT. I'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT MY FAMILY. I'M THEIR ONLY HOPE. IT'S FOR THEIR SAKE THAT I'VE GOT TO FIND A RICH HUSBAND. - WELL, LIKE I SAID, I'M LOADED. - MM-HM. BUT THE MAN I WANT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE RICH RIGHT NOW. I MEAN, IF HE'S RICH RIGHT NOW AND DOESN'T SHOW MUCH INITIATIVE, THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE HE'LL BE POOR BY THE TIME I'M READY TO MARRY HIM. BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IF HE'S POOR RIGHT NOW AND SHOWS LOTS OF INITIATIVE, WELL, THEN THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT HE'LL BE RICH BY THE TIME I'M READY TO MARRY HIM AND THAT'S WHEN I WANT HIM RICH. WHEN I'M READY TO MARRY HIM. BYE-BYE, MILTON. - WELL, HERE I AM, DAPPER DOBIE, RIGHT ON TIME. - DOBIE, I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOUR DEAL WITH MR. ZIEGLER. - SO IT'S ALL OVER, HUH? - OH, DON'T BE SILLY. I THINK IT'S JUST MARVELOUS THE WAY YOU THOUGHT UP THIS WHOLE THING. I MEAN, IT SHOWS REAL INITIATIVE AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS, INITIATIVE. - WELL, WELL. - NOW HOW MUCH IS MR. ZIEGLER PAYING YOU? - PAYING ME? - YES. HOW MUCH MONEY IS HE GIVING YOU? - NO, NO, NO. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, THALIA. I DON'T GET MONEY. HE JUST LETS ME WEAR THE CLOTHES FOR NOTHING. - WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE ADVERTISING HIS CLOTHES, AREN'T YOU? - WELL, YEAH, BUT... - AND ADVERTISING COSTS MONEY. NOW IF HE BOUGHT ADS IN THE NEWSPAPER OR ON TELEVISION, HE'D HAVE TO PAY, WOULDN'T HE? - YEAH, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. - NO, IT'S NOT. ADVERTISING IS ADVERTISING AND IT COSTS MONEY AND YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME. NOW YOU'RE GOING TO TELL MR. ZIEGLER, DO YOU HEAR? - ALL RIGHT, THALIA, ALL RIGHT. - WHEN? - SOON, THALIA, SOON. - TODAY, RIGHT NOW. - BUT IT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DAY. I THOUGHT MAYBE WE'D TAKE A WALK. - THAT'S RIGHT. WE'LL TAKE A WALK RIGHT DOWN TO MR. ZIEGLER'S TO GET SOME MONEY. - BUT, BUT... - NO BUTS. WE'RE GOING IN TO GET YOU SOME MONEY. - THANKS A LOT. - IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT. WHY WEREN'T YOU MORE FORCEFUL? - BECAUSE I'M NOT FORCEFUL, THAT'S WHY. - THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE NOT FORCEFUL AND YOU'RE NOT RICH. ALL YOU'VE GOT IS INITIATIVE AND I'M AFRAID THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME, DOBIE. I'VE GOT PEOPLE DEPENDING ON ME. YOU DO UNDERSTAND? - WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN? - WELL, THAT DEPENDS. - THE MONEY, HUH? - IT'S NOT ME, DOBIE. IT'S MY FAMILY. - YOU MEAN YOUR FATHER'S... - HIS KIDNEY CONDITION. YOU UNDERSTAND? - KIDNEY CONDITION, YEAH. - OKAY. GOODBYE, DOBIE. - YOU BLEW THE JOB WITH ZIEGLER, HUH? - YEAH. - GOOD. - GOOD? IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID? GOOD? - SURE, MAN. NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR ALL THOSE CLOTHES ANYMORE. - WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH THEM? - WELL, DOBIE, YOU'RE MY BUDDY AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING. BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, YOU WERE LOOKING PRETTY CRUMMY. - IN ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL CLOTHES? - DOBIE, YOU DON'T, LIKE, UNDERSTAND. CLOTHES ARE NO GOOD. THEY'RE LIKE A PRISON. - I SEE. - I MEAN, THEY SQUEEZE YOU, HEM YOU IN. A GUY OUGHT TO BE, LIKE, FREE. NOW YOU TAKE ANIMALS. NAME ME ONE ANIMAL WHO WEARS CLOTHES. - NAME ME ONE ANIMAL WHO LISTENS TO DIZZY GILLESPIE. - I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. - THINK ABOUT IT. - WHERE YOU GOING? - OH, I DON'T KNOW. - THALIA? - NO, NO, THAT'S OVER. - WELL, CHEER UP, GOOD BUDDY. YOU ALWAYS GOT ME. - IT'S A GREAT COMFORT, MAYNARD, BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME. NOT QUITE THE SAME. - DOBIE? YOU STILL WANT THAT NEW SUIT? - ARE YOU GONNA GIVE ME THE MONEY? - WELL, NOT EXACTLY. - THAT'S WHAT I FIGURED. - I'VE GOT A SUIT UPSTAIRS, THOUGH, YOU MIGHT LIKE. IT'S NOT JUST NEW, BUT IT'S IN VERY FINE CONDITION. - OH? WHAT COLOR? - BROWN. - HEY, I LOOK GOOD IN BROWN. - WELL, NOT JUST BROWN. IT'S SORT OF AN OLIVE, OLIVE DRAB YOU'D CALL IT. - SOUNDS FINE. - BRASS BUTTONS ON THE COAT. - HEY, COOL. KIND OF A BLAZER, HUH? - KIND OF. ACTUALLY, IT'S MY OLD ARMY UNIFORM. - SWELL. - OF COURSE, YOU'D HAVE TO TAKE THE STRIPES OFF THE SLEEVES, SIX OF THEM, THREE UP AND THREE UNDER WITH A DIAMOND IN THE MIDDLE. - DAD? DAD, WERE YOU A FIRST SERGEANT DURING THE WAR? - YEP. - DAD? - YEAH? - YOU STILL ARE. - I GOTTA KILL THAT BOY.
