 Hey. Hey. Wouldn't a chainsaw be easier? Yeah, but not as much fun. How are you? I'm all right. I was just coming to see how you were doing. Yeah. I'm good. Why you asking? Just curious. Since we're being curious, where have you been the last few days?

 Doc gave me a few days off, so I could recover from the whole pot thing. How you doin' with that? I'd kind of rather just forget it ever happened. Yeah, well, some things are better left alone. But I think if... they're causing physical distress, then it's unhealthy not to talk about it. Somethin' you tryin' to tell me? I don't know about you, but I've been having a hard time sleeping. Look... you don't have to worry. Doc and I paid Calvin a visit. He knows to keep his distance from you, or he's gonna have to deal with me. Thank you.

 Yeah. But how have you been sleeping? Same as usual. Um... The night we got back, and you stayed over so I could fall asleep... Yeah. ...I think you were having a night terror. Night terror? Yeah. You were thrashing around, and yelling, and... Anyhow, I think I'd remember that. Unlike a nightmare, people sleep through night terrors. Mel... They're really not that uncommon for vets who've been in combat. Yeah, not this vet. But thank you for your concern. It's nothing to be ashamed of, Jack. I... Honestly... It... Ah, there you are. Hello, Mel. Jack, I need your help. Preacher's doing a roasted pig for the Mingle, but we've always done honey-baked hams. Do you know how long it takes to roast a pig? If it's not ready in time, we'll have a mutiny on our hands. - What do you want me to do about it? - Talk to him. He'll listen to you. I know better than to get between Preacher and his grill. Oh, you have one heart attack, everything goes to hell in a handbasket. And why haven't you RSVP'd? I know you think we're backwoods, but folks around here consider it rude to ignore an invitation. I... I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Tonight is Virgin River's annual Moonlight Mingle. Still lost. The Moonlight Mingle is the premier social event on the Virgin River calendar. Every year, the entire town gets together at one of our resident farms for dinner and dancing. When you least expect it, the DJ shouts "Mingle," and all dancers have to switch partners. - So, it's kind of like a square dance. - No! It's not like square dancing. This is a semi-formal event. Yeah. It's actually kind of elegant. Okay. Well, thank you very much, but I'm gonna have to pass. You can't pass. That would be considered highly unsociable. - By who? - Me. And the entire town. I'm not much of a dancer. That's a lie. Hey, sis. Joey. I'll get you guys a coffee. - Oh, no thanks. I'm okay. - Yeah, that'd be great. Wow, this place is really committed to the dead animal motif, huh? - Well, every one tells a story. - With a very upsetting ending. Hey, I just work here. No, Jack owns the bar. Oh, that Jack. Now I get it. Get what? Nothing. - Thank you. - Any time. Hey, Ricky. Come over here and meet Mel's sister, Joey. Hi, ma'am. He called me ma'am. How cute is that? You're all my witness. Preacher swears the pig will be ready by six. And it will. So, Joey... what brings you to town? I wanted to see the place that has so captivated my little sister. Well, if you need anything while you're here, ask Jack. Mel, I'll see you at the Mingle. Feel free to bring your sister. What's a "Mingle"? Don't ask. Come on. I'll show you around town before I have to go to work. - Okay. - Okay. If you'd given me a little notice, I could have rearranged my schedule. If I'd given you a little notice, then my visit would not have been a surprise. Hey, hey, hey, leave that. We'll get that over to the Fitches' for you. - Thanks. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. - Yeah. Any time. - See you later. - Yeah. Okay. Truth. What are you doing here? Are you kidding? You were just held up at gunpoint by drug dealers. They weren't dealers, they were growers. And how is that better? Like I told you, I am fine. Well, I had to see for myself. You look lovely. What about Bill and the kids? It's your birthday tomorrow? Well, this was his present to me. Three days, no kids, and no responsibilities. What is the matter? Aren't you happy to see me? I am happy to see you. I just find it really odd that you chose to have your birthday in Virgin River. I chose to spend my birthday with you. Okay? Hi. Hey. Well... the attorney can meet with us this afternoon. The Mingle is tonight. Uh... there are a dozen loose ends. No way I can take time out to meet with an attorney today. He is going on vacation. He can meet us today or a month from now. Who takes a month-long vacation? Do you want the appointment or not? Fine. But we need to keep it short. Yeah, well, believe me, I want this over as quickly as possible. Hey, did you hear? Mel's sister came to town. No, and why would I care? I hope she's not gonna try to talk Mel into leaving. I would tell you to stay out of Mel's business, but that'd be like... like telling a bull to ignore the color red. So, in this scenario, I'm the bull? If the horns fit. Oh, um... bring your checkbook to that meeting with the attorney. For what? Well, because executing divorce papers isn't cheap. It'll be a few thousand dollars. Are you suggesting we go halfsies on our divorce? I don't see why we wouldn't. Divorce wasn't my idea. - I don't have that kind of money. - Oh, woman, you lie like a rug. Fine. I'll pay my share, but you should be ashamed of yourself. It was your indiscretion that caused all this, so it should be you who pays the price. This is nice. A roll-away. How quaint. - Well, they were fully booked... - Oh. ...which can happen when you show up unannounced. I know. I think we should share your bed. Uh... okay, we haven't done that since we were kids. I know. It'll be fun. What are you doing? What do you think the thread count is here? 'Cause I'm guessing it's 250, tops. Oh, come on. Don't be a snob. The Fitches have been very gracious to me. Oh, grace has nothing to do with it. I'm allergic to non-organic fibers. Fortunately, I brought my own sheets. You always think of everything. Hah! Bill would disagree. According to him, I have no idea how the real world works. He said that to you? You know what? I don't wanna talk about Bill. I wanna know what's going on with you. How's the baby doing? Chloe? Oh, I just went and saw her, actually. She's doing good. She's finally at a healthy weight. She's so adorable. Must have been really hard to give her up. I didn't give her up. I reunited her with her mother. Still. Why don't we talk about your birthday? I heard that there's a decent spa in Eureka. Yeah, you know what? I don't really wanna do anything for my birthday. Okay, so you came here to celebrate your birthday, but you don't want to celebrate your birthday. - Got it. - I don't want to make a big deal of it. What are you even talking about? You always wanna do something big. I mean, last year, you and Bill went to Tahiti. Well, this year, I just feel like being more low-key. You didn't come here to celebrate anything. You came here to convince me to leave. That's not true. It's not. I do think that coming home would be the best thing for you. Look, I told you that no matter what happens here, I'm not coming back to LA, okay? And have you ever even considered that me starting over somewhere might be the best thing for me? Except you're not starting over. - You're living in denial. - Really? I mean, you still have your wedding ring on, for God's sakes. You know, just because I'm having trouble letting go doesn't mean that I'm in denial. Okay? I came here so that I could help people. And I'm staying here for the moment because I made a commitment. You made a mistake. The sooner you realize that, the better off you'll be. - Oh, my God. You don't get it. - Yes, I do. I know exactly what you're doing. No, you don't. You haven't for years. Because life is more to me than a Barneys mid-year sale. Okay, look. I may not be as smart and successful as you are, but at least I'm honest about who I am and what I want. - Mel... - No, I can't. ♪ You don't really care ♪ What can I get you? How about an entire bottle of gin? Uh-oh. How about an iced tea? - Ugh... fine. - Everything okay? No. My sister's been here for five minutes and we're already fighting. You know, I got a friend, he has brothers. They fought all the time. But then as soon as one hit the other one, bam, it's all over. So, what are you saying? I should punch her? - It worked for the Hill brothers. - Great. Come on. Just apologize. Enjoy her visit. - She'll be gone before you know it. - You're right. You're right. I know she loves me so much, but she just can't wrap her head around why I'm here. Yeah, well, I get that. Yeah, my family thought I was crazy when I moved here. I guess it was a little unexpected, but I didn't fit in when I went home after Iraq. I just... You know what, in the end, what I realized was that I needed to make a new home for myself. Right. That's exactly what I'm trying to do, but she still wants me to move back to LA. I don't know. Maybe she's right. Maybe I should just go back. Well, I didn't, uh... I didn't realize that was still on the table. My trial period with Doc is almost up, and... at some point I have to decide whether or not I'm going to stay here for the rest of the year. Well, you know, the pull of family is strong. Especially when you're feeling alone. Exactly. You know, there's real value in being independent. I am independent. I know. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Well, regardless, I need to go apologize to my sister. Well, the view's always better from the high road. Yes, it is. Wow, did Hope order all of this? Yeah. I guess she's expecting quite the turnout. Yeah. She ordered enough pecan pie to feed an army. Well, unfortunately, I'll be more than happy to eat the leftovers. I have a weakness for anything pecan related. I think I get it from my dad. He grew up on a pecan farm in Texas. I thought your father grew up in the northeast. No... uh... but he did move to upstate New York in high school. So, are you, uh... going tonight? Yeah, I promised Hope that I would. If you, uh... if you want, you know, we could drive out together. Oh. Um... I... I would, but I have some things I need to take care of up in Clear River, so I was just gonna drive straight from there. Yeah. Yeah, that's, uh... that's smart. - I'll see you tonight, kiddo. - Bye, Preacher. - Okay. See ya. - Thanks. What stuff? What stuff are we doing in Clear River? Nothing. I just said that to make things easier. So, you lied? I don't want to hurt Preacher's feelings. And you shouldn't be eavesdropping, anyway. How else am I gonna find out stuff? Hey, remind me how I got roped into this? You can go back to working at the bar with Preacher. Uh... Copy that. Guys, I'd really like to hand the keys over by the end of the week. Well, what's the big rush? I just think it should be done by then. Oh, uh... okay. Hey, baby. Hey. What are you doing here? I thought you'd be at work. Well, I had a little bit of a gap in my schedule, so I thought I'd come and give you this. Hm. Preacher told me where to find you. Wow, you've really transformed this place. - Yeah, that's the plan. - Hm. Well, speaking of plans, I need you to make a decision. Dinner. Before or after the Mingle? Oh, right. Yeah. Uh, well, I guess we could grab somethin' in Clear River beforehand. Sounds like a plan. Okay. Bye, boys. - What? - Nothin'. Well, hey, if you got somethin' to say. Nah. Just, uh, thinkin'. You got a lot on your plate these days. - Hey. - Hey. I thought you wanted to stay in. I changed my mind. - Joey. - What? I want to go to that Mingle thing. Look, I want to apologize for what I said earlier. I'm sorry too. Now, can I borrow some shoes? Because if this thing is at a farm, I'm gonna need, like, a wedge heel. Can we talk, please? We both said things we didn't mean. Okay? Let's just forget about it. Go out, have some fun. - Really? You're not mad? - No. I should not have said what I did. - Okay. - So get ready, 'cause I feel like dancing. Well, I don't think the Mingle is gonna live up to your expectations. As long as there's a bar, I will be fine. Okay?

Ah, it looks like the entire town showed up. Is Lilly coming? Oh, she's doing better, but wasn't ready for a big event. She's seeing a therapist up in Clear River who's really helping her. When she told me about Chloe, oh, I just said, "Well, honey, I love you, and the entire town is here for you." Huh? It's what we do. Hope. What the hell? - Vernon, this isn't the time. - What is wrong with you? You're the one who insisted on this divorce, - and you don't show up to the meeting? - I got busy. Preacher tried to bait and switch the salad. Lucky I intervened, or you'd all be eating arugula. I don't give a rat's ass about the salad. You could have had the decency to let me know you couldn't come. - Lecturing me about decency. That's rich. - Oh, come on.

I'm Joey, Mel's sister. I don't think we formally met. - Preacher. - Hey. Nice to meet you, Joey. Yeah. Have you seen Paige? Oh, no, we just got here. Do you mind holding this? I forgot my clutch. - Sure. - I'm gonna go to the bar. Oh, I'll come with you. Oh, that's okay. I don't need a chaperone. - Okay. - Okay. Nice to meet you. All right, everybody. Time to mingle. Uh... - Mingle? - Mingle. - [chuckles[ Okay. - Okay. - Like that? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm not the, uh... best dancer. - Neither am I. It's fine. - Oh! That is so sweet of you to lie to me. So, how are you enjoying Virgin River? Um... honestly? It's been a little bit of an adjustment. Yeah. - Yeah, I bet. - Yeah. Mm. But Jack's been a big help... - Yeah. - ...so that's great. Yeah, he is a good man. Yeah. How long did you guys serve together? - Ten years. - Ten years. Yeah. Wow. You must be really close. We're brothers. In fact, I swear I know him better than he knows himself. I can't imagine how hard it must've been. We were all there to... to do a job. Jack was there to make sure we all got home alive. Sounds like a lot of pressure. Yeah. Oh, he handled it. Do you think he's still handling it? Yeah, I'm sure. I mean, every now and then, he gets, uh... a little wound up, but that's just being human. Has he ever had any help? Well, Jack prefers to manage his business on his own. Yeah, but if it was a broken bone, you'd get it set, right? It's really no different. Bit of advice. Wherever you're going with this... I wouldn't. See, Jack believes in lettin' sleepin' dogs lie. Now it's time for a new partner.

Ah. I have, uh, two. - Oh, you do? - Yeah. Are you close? Um... no. No. That's too bad. Well, it is what it is, you know? Everyone thinks, uh, families should all get along. Sometimes they do, sometimes they do not. Yeah. Um, Hope thinks that your sister is here to convince you to leave. Is that right? - Yeah, I suspect that's probably the case. - Ah.

I'm sorry, I accidentally saw a text on your phone from him. You read my text? I'm just trying to help you, okay? I... Why didn't you just tell me what was going on? Because my marriage is none of your business. Wow. I can't believe you just said that. You have been running my life since I was 11 years old, but I'm not allowed to discuss Bill with you? Do you think that I wanted to run your life? Yeah, it sure seems like you do. Do you have any idea how many things I gave up so that I could take care of you? I didn't ask you to take care of me. Well, who else was gonna do it? After Mom died, I mean, Dad was a mess. Overnight, you became my responsibility. Wow. I'm so sorry that I was such a burden for you. Okay? But I'm not a child anymore. - Then stop acting like one. - Oh, me? Yes, you. You don't wanna face the past or the future, so you did what a child would do. You ran away from home. Look, you can hide out here for as long as you want, but until you deal with reality, you are never gonna get your life back on track. Just because I'm not you does not mean that my life isn't on track. It's time to mingle. Joey. I... Dance with me. All righty. She certainly has a knack for holdin' a grudge. Like a dog with a bone. Oh, it's been 20 years. Well, heartbreak can be, you know, a long time to heal. Yeah, but I... I have apologized. And I've apologized. I don't... I don't know what else I can do. You don't get it. Well... what is there to get? The reason Hope can't forgive you is because... she believed that you were the one person in the world who wouldn't hurt her. After two crappy husbands, you were supposed to be her knight in shining armor. You were the one she was supposed to drive off into the sunset with. Yeah, but Hope, she doesn't... doesn't believe in all that fairy tale crap. She used to... before you broke her heart. Oh, Jiminy Christmas. She ain't never gonna forgive me. As one of Hope's oldest friends... this is my two cents. You have to find a way to earn back her trust. Time to mingle. ♪ And I'll sell my lies ♪ Ooh! Ah-ah-ah! Ah...

Oh, Jack Sheridan. I can't thank you enough. For the dance? No, for taking Ricky under your wing. Oh, come on. Your grandson is a great kid. Well, he certainly idolizes you. Huh. I mean, he never had a real father. It's good he has you for a role model. Boys need good men to help them grow up. Mm-hm. When he came here after losing his mom the way he did, it...
