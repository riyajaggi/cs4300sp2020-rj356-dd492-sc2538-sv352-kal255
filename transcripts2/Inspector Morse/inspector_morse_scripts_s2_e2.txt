 Inspector Morse (1987â€“2000): Season 2, Episode 2 - Last Seen Wearing - full transcript 
 Morse and Lewis investigate the disappearance of teenager Valerie Craven who vanished some six months previously while walking home from her exclusive girls school. Morse is the third detective assigned to the case and is convinced that the girl is by now dead. However, the girl's parents receive a note, purportedly from Valerie. Suspicion falls on a number of people, including fellow students, men named in her diary and some of the teachers at her school. When one of the teachers is killed, the missing persons enquiry becomes a murder investigation.

 Right. When I was wondering where you were. Right. (Sighs) Not having a depression, are we? No, we're not. Every time l drive past your neck of the woods, there seems to be another new off-licence. And I think to myseIf, "Bees round the honey pot." Good. Know who this is? - I don't want those. - lt's the files on the Craven case. And? - And...so I thought you'd want them. - Well, l don't. (Sighs)

 - Lewis. - Sir? - When did she go missing? - About six months ago. Yes, yes. The date? l don't know exactly. l'd have to check in the file. What's all this about flu, Lewis? - I don't know, sir. (Mimics Lewis) l don't know, sir. Anything else? Yes. l'm sorry to disappoint you, Lewis, but she's dead. How do you know? They put me onto these things when they can smell a corpse. One file? Anybody. Two fiIes? AinIey or McKay. l'm the three-file man. No, she's dead. (Whistle) (Whistle) Pass it to me! MORSE: The cream of the country, eh? LEWlS: I wouIdn't know, sir. Rich and thick. That's a bit unfair, isn't it? We wouldn't mind our Louise going to this school. She's not rich or thick. Have you ever thought about the person who designed the sports skirt? Somebody sat down and drew a fantasy and made it compuIsory uniform. l can never watch Wimbledon without thanking that man. Shall we go in? ln a minute. Towards the goal. Come on. A final effort! Erm, can l help you? HeIIo. This is private property. Are you parents? Er, l'm not. No. But Sergeant Lewis is. l see. Do you have an appointment, lnspector Morse? l'm assuming you're here about Valerie Craven. That's why l'm here, yes, but l think Sergeant Lewis would like some information about your fees. (Whistle) An interesting girl. Bright. Quite bright. Wild, but l liked her. l taught her English. She left school on Thursday 24th March at about 4:30. She's a day girl. She waved goodbye to me, actually. lt's rather ironic. She just walked off down the drive. No-one's heard from her since. Wild is not fair, really. Spirit. l thought you people had given up. Oh, no. l expect you know her father through the Police Committee. l've never met the man. l am intimate with one of his cement mixers. - l'm sorry? - There's a lot of building going on near me. - Everywhere you look. - That's right. - And very ugly. - That's right. GlRL: Sorry, Miss Baines. - He's a powerful man. - That's why we're still trying to find his daughter. Your ordinary missing person gets about a week. What do you think has happened to her? l've no idea. You should ask the Head. He knows the family very well. George Craven is a school governor and so on. Was she happy, would you say? Yes, l should think so. l mean, slice any teenager in half and there's a great deal of melancholy and angst and rage. But l would have said she was happy. Yeah. Excuse me. Mrs Webb, erm... ls the Head around? There are a couple of police officers who'd like a word with him. lt sounds familiar, sir. What does? Well, you know, melancholy and rage and so on. (Bell rings) What time is it? Coming up to 2:40. Hm. My cousin is married to a woman who's 1 2 years younger than he is. Which means when he was 20, she was eight. Did they know each other when she was eight? l don't know. l'm sorry to keep you waiting. The Head's been delayed. He was at a headmasters' conference in London over the weekend. We'll make an appointment. Time, please, ladies and gentlemen. Time, please. Thank you. Two pints, please. Sorry. l've called time. - When? - Just now. Oh, come on. Two pints. Sorry. - There are people still drinking. - Sir. Thanks, sir. Otherwise l'd get shot. l got you these. lt was all they had. - For me? - Yes, sir. Undrinkable! lt's not real beer, you see. That's nothing to do with beer. Take it home. Thanks all the same. Right. Where are we going? To see the dad. LEWlS: We've got specific instructions not to disturb the family. MORSE: That's right. LEWlS: The thing with you is, if somebody tells you you can't do something, you go on and do it. MORSE: l make it a rule. CRAVEN: Other chap on leave, is he? MORSE: No. Fresh legs, l think, is the idea. l can't say l liked him very much. Not much going on upstairs. The man doesn't have to be stupid because he hasn't found your daughter. You see, four months ago, this was pasture, where we're standing now. You know, a bit of a farm. And you go in and you get on with it. You make things happen. You sweat. - You get results. - Yes. l dredged the canals myself. My people. But l was there, personally. And the reservoir. l didn't want somebody going on about the cost. l put stuff in the newspaper and there's a reward. l hope you've got a few half-decent ideas. Not yet, no. Morse? Are you the drinker? l don't know. Are you the tyrant? See these shoes? Horrible, aren't they? Full of muck. l never buy good shoes, because l spend my life wading through muck. My wife won't let me through the front door of the house. That's all you need to know about me. What do you think has happened to Valerie? Kidnapped? Yet there was no phone call. Temper? But you can't be angry for six months, can you? So, l dredged the canal. l walked the woods behind my house with a rake in my hand. Has a temper, though, does she? - Have you got any kids, Morse? - No. No. - Come towards me. - What? Just come towards me. Take my arm. (Shrill whistle) (Whistle stops) These are going to be compulsory at Homewood. l've ordered 1 ,000 of them. So, you've no idea why Valerie might have decided to leave home? - A man? A quarrel? - Read the files, lnspector. l'm not going to repeat myself. Get your feet dirty. What was that noise? MORSE: I think that was a cry from the heart. Bye-bye. GlRL: Goodbye, Miss Baines. - Bye. See you tomorrow. Cheryl, l gather l missed a visit. That's right. - And? - Oh, l'm sure they'll be back. Prod, prod. Poke, poke. They wanted to know if Valerie had ever confided in me about anything, - if there was something on her mind. - And you said? Oh, nothing much. Excuse me, Headmaster. (Engine starts) - Sir. - Yes? Listen to this. l'm fine. Don't worry. l'm very happy and this is the right thing for me. l know you've been worrying and l want to tell you everything, but l can't. But please don't worry about me. Love and hugs, Valerie. - What's all that about? - The Cravens got this this morning. Postmark? London. SW3. Yesterday. Hm. Well, she's obviously alive and we can assume she's in London. l took her diary home with me last night. There's mention of a John Maguire, a boyfriend, who lives in the SW3 area. l think she's there. Good. That's all right, then. lt is. l think we should go and pay this Maguire a visit. You go. - Did anybody read this diary before you, Lewis? - Oh, yes, sir. Of course. Chief lnspector Ainley interviewed the man on two separate occasions. He kept her under the bed, then. What's the matter? Nothing. lt's hot. No. l mean, Valerie Craven. What's the matter? Valerie Craven is dead. Why do you want her to be dead? And if she is dead, how can she write this letter and post it? - ls there a date on that letter? - No. Let me look at it. How do we know this is Valerie Craven's handwriting? Well, l'm having it checked, but it matches the writing in her diary to an untrained eye. OK. So, you're guessing it's a genuine letter. lt doesn't mean it was written yesterday. It doesn't mean she posted it herseIf. It doesn't mean it was actuaIIy written to her parents. l mean, the envelope doesn't match particularly, and it may well be that this sheet of paper has lost its head. ''Dear who?'' is what we should be asking ourselves. Dear who and when? He's not likely to be home this time of day, is he? Exactly. So, if he's hiding her under the bed, we'll find out, won't we? MORSE: Know this man, do you? - Mr Maguire? l know who he is, yes. I don't know him in the sense of knowing him, no. Thanks. - l should come in with you. - l'd rather you kept an eye on our backs. l know before l meet Mr Maguire that l won't like him. - What's that, sir? - Nothing. Do you like London, Lewis? No, not much. - Our Maguire's a country sort, by the looks of it. - You reckon? We ought to be able to arrest him for his taste, Lewis, but we can't. So, you know, erm... Has he paid his television licence? Er... ls his telephone approved? He goes in for the gadgets. Owes his credit cards a lot of money. ln fact, he owes them nearly as much as l earn in a year. Hateful, but not enough. What about...this? These. No, no, no. Cross-dressing, it's legal. No, l mean, Valerie? You see, if Valerie lived here, there'd be magazines, her books... l don't know, something. lf she died here, that's different. lnteresting. VlDEO: ..it wiII contain a unique mixture of residentiaI and commerciaI... Mr Maguire, our negotiator, is upstairs in the show flat. Please walk up. What does she say about Maguire in her diary? Nothing very er... No, l can't remember precisely, to tell the truth, sir. - His name, obviously. - Memorable stuff. Well, you know, they met at a party. Oh, his star sign. She talks about his star sign. There's your motive, then. He murders anyone who asks him his sign. l like him better already. lt's very sophisticated and very sensitive. lt means you can leave the door open and stiII be secure. Now, if someone couIdjust be the burgIar. No, hang on. l'll be the burglar. Would you be kind enough? Just press the buttons marked "poIice" and "aIarm" on. And then off when l trigger the alarm, all right? On, then off. Great. So, here l am after your original Picasso, your Ming vase and the keys to your Porsche. I spend haIf an hour forcing the doubIe-turn Iock, tiptoe in... - And hey presto. (High-pitched alarm) And it's also sounding downstairs at the porter's lodge. Thanks. Could you turn it off, please? Well done. Mr Maguire, could we have a word? Yeah, l'll answer any questions at the end. Just a few minutes outside. lf you missed the start, we can go around again when l've finished. We're policemen. And? We'd like a brief word in private. What about? l'm working. ls this more about Valerie Craven? Give me a few seconds, will you? - Just have a wander around. MAN: OK. l've had it up to here with you people. Let's just go out on the balcony, shall we? l'm going to speak to my lawyer about this. This is harassment. l'm sorry, sir. What is? I made a statement. I've been questioned about eight times. Not by us. Look, I met her at a party. l saw her once or twice. This is like months ago. End of subject. - She writes about you in her diary. - Yeah? Did she ever visit your flat? No! l met her in Oxford at a party. l don't know where she is or what happened to her. - Nice flat you've got. - Say again? lt's not quite in this league, but erm... We thought it was very erm... - What did we think it was, Sergeant? - When did you go to my flat? - Just now. Had a little look around. - You what?! You'd better have a warrant, otherwise... Otherwise what? How's the nose? My nose is fine, thanks. How's yours? A bit sniffy. (Sniffs) Don't try that on. There's nothing there. lt's absolutely clean. lt's very hard to be absolutely clean. Tell me, when did Valerie Craven tell you she was pregnant? Look, you'd better let me get rid of these. Go ahead. l didn't know she was pregnant. No, neither did l. OK. Chief lnspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis are here to ask you some questions about Valerie. Now, l'm going to go. I think the officers are worried I might inhibit you. So, don't spare them any of the dirt. The truth about DooIey. The caretaker. He's 1 03, but we've got our theories. So, they're all yours. lf they bite, press the fire alarm. - Or get them to press their personal alarms. - Yes, we heard about them. Yes, we're aII kitted out, aren't we? ''She was never short of men,'' a school friend confided. ''She was always in love, every five minutes,'' said her best friend. ''Really wild.'' Another friend. Et cetera, et cetera. So, is this true? - Not really. - l think it is, actually. - It's ridicuIous. - They make things up. lt's common knowledge. None of us talked to the press. They put words into your mouth. Did she ever mention the name of any boyfriend? No. LEWlS: John Maguire? GlRL: I know about him. Only because we've heard this before from some other policemen and they talked about her diary and stuff. But she might write something in her diary that wasn't even true. I've done that. I mean, your diary's personaI, isn't it? It can be describing something you hope might happen. lf anybody found my diary, they'd have a field day. (Laughter) - What about boyfriends at the university? Possibly. l don't know. There might have been. But what about crushes? Everybody has crushes. That's what we're trying to say to you. Everybody has boyfriends, or not, as the case may be. (Giggling) Crushes on teachers? Sure. MORSE: VaIerie? - Everybody. There aren't many male members of staff to choose from. - Not that they'd necessarily have to be male. - There's Dooley. Apart from Dooley. - Ron. - Who's Ron? Mr Ronald. Classics. - Is he nice? - He's all right. And Mr Acum, but he's left. - DPP? - DPP? The Head. Mr Phillipson. We've both travelled, we're both ambitious. But we came here, in the autumn, l remember, and the leaves were shedding in great flocks and it was beautiful. Remember that? Gosh. l'm not intending to leave. They'll have to carry me out. - lt's very nice. - lt is. Becky, top up lnspector Morse. lt's wonderful for Sheila. She has a fellowship. St Thomas's. She has the brains. l'm the domestic. SHElLA: Both Iies. PHlLLlPSON: Do you go in for these? - No. - You should. Three is perfect. Someone to bowl at, someone on the boundary - and someone to keep wicket. - Don't take any notice of him. We never do. Does it bother you, living on the school grounds? Quite the contrary. l come home for lunch. l live like a lord. l have my wonderful school. l have my little zoo here. - I'm very Iucky. MORSE: Do you have any theories... - Do you mind my talking about Valerie Craven? - Absolutely. Go ahead. We make it a policy to talk as a family. Right. - I just wondered what your thoughts were. - What happened to Valerie? Well, um...l think it's... Well, you think... Sorry, darling. You carry on. No, sorry, darling. Carry on. WeII, untiI we heard she'd written to her parents, l think we'd come to imagine, hadn't we, - that she was probabIy not going to turn up. - l think that was our... - Yes. - But obviousIy... ObviousIy, since the Ietter, - what can one think other than... - She's aIive. Thank God. But where? - And with whom? - What are your theories so far? l don't seem to have theories. l have questions, which l don't have the answers to. Sergeant Lewis is the man with aII the theories. Isn't that right? Well, l've always thought that Valerie was alive, l must say, and that we'll find her. l think we're on her trail. Mind you, Sergeant Lewis has some very far-fetched ideas. We've had Valerie having an affair with the caretaker, Dooley, and you. Dooley! Wonderful idea. - And you. SHElLA: That's much more pIausibIe. - She was terribly pretty. - Yes. I'm rather fIattered by the idea. Donald, you know very well that half of Homewood has a huge crush on you. Half is an exaggeration. - A third, at most. MORSE: And then he moved on. Didn't you, Lewis? Mr RonaId's come and gone. And who's the man that Ieft? The French teacher? - Oh, Acum. David Acum. SHElLA: Oh, now, he was nice. ln fact... lt's heresy, l know, but, given his wife, who was a crushing stodge, it has to be said, he could be forgiven for having... - No, he couldn't. - No, he couIdn't. And, no, he didn't. There are some people you can imagine jumping into bed and there are others for whom the imagination will not leap. - Where is he now? - Reading. - A comprehensive. - Better money? Considerably less, l'd imagine. - So...? - Who knows? lt was a Catholic school he went to. AIthough I don't think he was particuIarIy reIigious. A chip? PoIitics? Pressure from the wife? I don't know. You must realise that some people look at a school like Homewood and every beautiful tree, each A-level result, every motivated student is an insult to them. Not that it was necessarily true of Acum. But he was a sort of... Morris Minor type. Just wait. l'll go. Mrs Acum? Chief lnspector Morse. Thames Valley. l think my sergeant will have phoned. l came on the off chance of seeing your husband. ls he in? No. No. - He doesn't come home for lunch? - No. Well...l'm sorry l've disturbed you and er... Obviously... Do those... l've always wondered, do those things hurt when they come off? No. No, they don't. Well, there you are. l learnt something, anyway. Thanks. (Horn beeps) Of course l remember her. Has she turned up, then? - No, but she's been writing letters. - Really? - Recently? - A couple of days ago. Well, that's good, isn't it? At least she's alive. Great. As far as we can gather, Mr Acum, - you must have been one of the last to see her. - Was l? This is her French exercise book. ''Valerie, please see me after the lesson.'' And French was the last lesson. - And is that the day she went missing? - March 24th. Oh. - Oh, sorry. Would either of you like one? - No, thanks. - You're very welcome. - Positive. You're quite right. l make terrible sandwiches. l can't work out whether this is p?t? or peanut butter. - What would this have been about, sir? - VaIerie? Let me see. There was an exam coming up, l seem to remember. l probably wanted to have a word with her about it. Or was there? l don't know, actually. lt could have been about anything. March. Is it as Iong ago as that? Amazing. So, didn't you enjoy teaching young ladies? - lt was all right. - Why move, then? l don't know. l wasn't very happy there, to tell you the truth. I don't know. That schooI, Homewood, it's one of those places where you feel... l expect you've been there. lt's one of those places where you feel the sun shines all the time. All day. Every day. Sun. And you can't help remembering aII the pIaces where it's aIways cIoudy. You start to think that the one pIace is sunny at the expense of the other's cIoud and vice versa. l'm beginning to sound like the weather report. LEWlS: Well, l thought Acum was a nice bloke. MORSE: The kiss of death, saying that to me, Lewis. lt makes me very suspicious. He goes straight to the top of my list. What about the forensic labs at Aldermaston? - Seen it. - And? 90% probability in favour of her having written it. So what's the problem? She can't have, Max. She's dead. l'm positive. You mean, about 90% positive? Look, Morse, I'm a pathoIogist. - I'm not a handwriting expert. - But? Well, it could be forged. l don't know. l could probably forge that handwriting, but then l'm not your average bod in the street. - Same again? - No. Bitter, please. - What's the matter with you? - Nothing at all. A girl's missing. She writes a letter to her parents. - That's good, isn't it? - Why does she cut off - the top of the paper? - A printed address? - ''Dear Mum and Dad''? - Maybe she doesn't think they are ''dear''. l don't know. No, you see, l've spent the past week around all this money... All these beautiful places, things. People who tell me how happy they are, that they've got everything they want. Everyone is very polite, smiles at me. And l'm not convinced. l don't believe it. That's you, though, friend, isn't it? - That's your problem. - ls it? Just because the girl is from a well-off family, it doesn't make the pain any less for the parents. No, but if her dad wasn't on the Police Committee, we wouldn't know anything about it. Only a man without children could talk the way you do. You know, imagine you've lost your only recording of the Ring Cycle. Try and think some things might hurt even worse than that. Yes, but l've got it on cassette as well. WAGNER: The Ride Of The Valkyries MRS CRAVEN: No, I'II teII you how I met my husband. He came over to lreland to hunt. l rode to hounds in those days. Anyway, George is a strong man and he lifted me off my horse. Literally. Were it possible, l think he would have carried me over to this country then. As it was, he had to observe a few formalities. l was married to someone else at the time. So... Will you have milk? Please. No sugar. What sort of relationship did you have with Valerie? l am her mother. We're very, very close. So, sometimes, she hated me. Right. But er... - You spoke? - Oh, yes. Did she tell you she was pregnant? No, because she wasn't. We have reason to believe she was. Well, you're quite wrong. l would have known. The night she disappeared, were you expecting her home as usual? - Of course. - Was she often late? - Sometimes. - Why? The usual things, you know. Something at school, visiting friends. l was never her jailer. These friends, would they be girlfriends or boyfriends? Oh, both, l would think, wouldn't you? l'm trying to work out why you didn't contact the police until the following morning. Because... my husband was away. Because, somehow, l was expecting her to walk through that door any minute. Because, somehow, l still am. Because l don't know. That's fine. And is Valerie... (Morse sighs) ls your husband Valerie's father? No, he isn't. He's always wanted us to have children, but, somehow, over the years... People have assumed that she's his, so... There's no need for him to know we've discussed this. l'm not saying he's an easy man, but he worships her. Yes. And when we got the letter... Well, you can imagine. MR CRAVEN ON VlDEO: That's it. Sir? - Where are the Craven files? - l've got them. - Well, bring them in. - Right. MORSE: Did you say you'd read that diary? LEWlS: I did, yes. What does she say about her dad? l don't know. Nothing l can remember. Well, just get it. lt's funny, looking at this. lt makes you feel sad, doesn't it? What, because she's dead, you mean? No, sir. l don't think she is dead. So you keep saying. She wrote a letter. The Path lab confirmed it was her handwriting. OK. She wrote a letter. She's alive. She's in London and quite happy where she is, thank you very much. Fine. We've still got to find her. Why? So we can drag her back home, tell her what a naughty girl she's been? Yeah, if we have to. lt is a missing persons case. So we find the person that's missing. lt's no case if she wrote the letter. OK. But the fact is she's dead. lt isn't missing persons, it's murder. (Knock at door) Yes? The Chief Super thought you ought to see this, sir. lt's just arrived. No prints. ''l hear you're trying to find me. l don't want you to, because l don't want to go back home. I'm very happy. Yours truIy, VaIerie Craven." lt's me. l know. l'm sorry. lt's just the police called. They've had another letter from Valerie. l know. She said... she didn't ever want to come home. Look, l really need to see you. l keep having these terrible dreams. l'm sorry. Yes, l'll go. OK. OK. (Bell rings) - You sent for me? - Yes. ls something the matter? l don't know. l had a phone call from the police this morning. They've received a Ietter from VaIerie. But they can't have! Sultry saxophone music (Doorbell) - lnspector. - l know it's late. - Is it too Iate? - Well, actually, it is. Right. l'm not going to turn you away. Then l won't go. - Here. - Oh, thank you. ls this a professional call? l think so, yes. - Cheers. - Cheers. So? l'll tell you. l can't think in straight lines, you see, so sometimes...l bash into the answers and sometimes l walk straight past them. Was that a mixed metaphor? Probably. Oh. So, you see, l've had some thoughts and l wanted your opinion. Although, probably what will happen, it'll be like that board game, where the last person you thought had done it had done it. Done what? Whatever it is. Well, l'm lost, but er...don't let that stop you. You live alone? Two cats. Anyway, l don't think that direction constitutes ''professional'', so erm... - TeII me about Mr PhiIIipson. - The Head? Very charming. You've met him. - Very charming. - Do you like him? Pass. ls he a good headmaster? l'm sure he is. - l'm not writing this down. - You don't need to. lsn't it the function of the Deputy to see the problems of the Head? Probably. Look, l'll tell you a story about Donald Phillipson. Last summer, at the Sports Day... We have a Sports Day, which is quite a grand affair, Iots of pretty dresses and hats and home-madejam, but quite serious as weII. You know, house teams, a cup. Anyway, at the end of it, for light relief, there was a race for the parents. Some teachers joined in, but mostly it was the dads. You know, pulling off their jackets. Borrowing the wrong-size pIimsoIIs. FaIIing over. Donald entered. He appeared in kit and wearing running spikes. He won. Right. Whenever l think about him, l remember the spikes. Yes. Men and their shoes. l'm sorry? Nothing. (Knock at door) Yes? l shan't keep you a moment. You look very nice. So? Morse. He came over to my house last night. - And? - And he'd like to meet us together tomorrow. - Why's that, do you think? - l've no idea. The Chief lnspector rather reminds me of a dog my parents once had. There was nowhere in the house l could go where he wouldn't find me. He was blind, the dog. l don't think he was a pedigree, but, in the end, he would always blunder in. Do you follow? Oh, l think so, Headmaster. You're requesting that l keep my mouth shut. You must have a lesson. A headmaster having an affair with one of his own schoolgirls? He's not such a fool, surely? Who knows? He wouldn't be the first. So, the child, if she was pregnant - Valerie, it would have been his? Yes. Not a very attractive picture. lt's not a very attractive world. I know it's to do with power. The world these people live in, power is what matters. Not sex. Not money. Of course, Valerie could just be out there somewhere this minute, couldn't she? - Just sitting there. - She could be, yes. Then the question is where? SW3? Or W1 , where the second letter was posted. l wouldn't bother too much about the second letter. ln fact, l wouldn't bother about it at all. l wrote the second letter myself. ?1 8.53. - What?! - ?1 8.53. (Doorbell) (Opens door) Oh, it's you. I suppose you'd better come in. That's your probIem. Get out. I said, get out of my house! Don't touch me. Let me go. You're hurting me! I said, Iet me go! No! - No sign of Miss Baines yet? - None. Do you want me to give her a ring? Yes, l think perhaps we'd better. She was all right yesterday, wasn't she? l think so, yes. Yes, do, telephone. Puss, puss, puss? (Scream echoes) How long? Difficult to say. Last night. After eight o'clock, probably, and before one or two in the morning. Pushed? l can't tell. lt's not easy to fall by accident. l don't know. Lewis says you knew her. ''Knew'' is an exaggeration. Can they move her? l think so. All right. Anything missing? l don't know yet. - l'll check upstairs. - Franks is upstairs. So? l'm just saying. Did you get a statement - from the cleaning lady? - Yes. Well, you've got your body, sir. What? You were so keen to have a murder. You should be happy. Right. What's interesting is that nine times out of ten, you'd survive a fall like that. The angle of the head. The nature of the surface. She was very unlucky. Poor thing. A pretty girl as well. Fine. - l'll get a report to you by tomorrow. - Thanks. What now? l thought you wanted a body. Oh, by the way, l've a bone to pick with you. - Which is? - What's this l hear about forged letters? l've no idea. Stir around, don't you? That's right. All right, Franks. l've had a good look, sir. l don't think there's anything in here. When you go downstairs, you'll find some Scotch in a cupboard. Pour me a glass, will you? Er, no, actually, erm... - Put it in a mug and don't make a fuss about it. - Sir. How do you know, sir, if you don't mind me asking, about the whisky, l mean? - Because l've drunk it before. - Right. (Shrill whistle) BECKY: Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! There you are. l've been shouting. l'll get a sore throat. George has fallen over. Mummy? lt's all right, darling. l'm coming, sweetheart. - Some...coffee? - Mm. There's nothing down there. So, what's next? l don't know. She collected first editions. Some er... Some very nice ones. A Lawrence. A Housman. The Waste Land. Valuable? l expect so. No, l meant in the sense of it being possibly an aggravated burglary. lt wasn't an aggravated burglary. She sent the first letter. Who? Miss Baines? ''Dear Julia.'' That's why she cut the top off. She sent the Cravens a letter that Valerie had written to someone else. MORSE: "PS: Love to Baines." l don't follow. Who's Julia? We met a Julia at Valerie's class. What, and she was killed for this, you think? No idea. Perhaps she was going to tell us something. l gave her an opportunity. She didn't take it. l've no idea. Sir, l'm er... l'm sorry about what l said earlier, about you wanting... lt was out of order. No. No, it wasn't. Come on. Let's go and find who did it. Sir, it's the Chief Superintendent. Here? Terrific. Morse. - Sergeant. - Sir. Well? The Deputy Head at Homewood School. l know that. And? lt looks as if somebody pushed her downstairs last night. (Sighs) Go and make yourself a coffee, Lewis. Sir. You can be a prat, can't you? l expect so. What's this about forging a letter? l forged a letter from the Craven girl. Brilliant. l was trying to make something happen. Well, something has happened. That's right. And what about the girl? Anything? l say to you, ''Don't bother the Craven family.'' The first thing you do is bother the Craven family. You sit in Oxford, forging Ietters and boozing, and the girI was Iast seen in London. You enter a flat without a warrant. And now the Deputy Head of the school has been bumped off. lt's all a bit of a shambles, Morse, really, isn't it, hm? Do you know who did this? No. No. Don't let me hear any more dirt on you, mate. Do I have to ask you to report to my desk every morning and breathe into my face? No, sir. Find the girl, find who did this and don't prat about. Who told you about the letter? Look, l'm the Chief Super. lf somebody asks for a whisky in a coffee mug, l know about it before he's even drunk it. That's myjob. You do yours. Come on. - Where? - Everywhere. l have absolutely no idea. MORSE: Where were you yesterday evening? At the theatre, as it happens. - Your wife with you? - No, she wasn't keen. She baby-sat. What happens if you both go out? lt depends. We might get one of the sixth-form boarders. Sheila's mother lives nearby. She comes over. No pattern. Am l a suspect? - Yes. - l see. Can l ask why? l've put this to you before. Now l want a proper answer. Were you having an affair with VaIerie Craven? No. Have l ever had an affair with any of my pupils? No. With any of my colleagues? No. What time did the play finish? lt was very long and not marvellous. l listened to the 1 1 o'clock news driving home. Did you pass Miss Baines' house on your journey? No. l have a staff meeting. My Deputy Head hasjust died. You've learned to take murder in your stride. l haven't. Anything else? Just a few details for Sergeant Lewis about your night out. Then we'll start nagging away at the theatre and the vicinity and where you parked your car, till we are satisfied you were where you say you were. (Knock at door) Come in. l'm very sorry, but l've got Julia Rawsley outside. She says she must speak to lnspector Morse. - lnspector? - ls there somewhere l can see her? Well, obviously there's Cheryl's room. - Or you could use er... Pauline? - Well, l... - Miss Baines' room will be fine. - Would you look after her? - Tell the staff l'll be a little delayed. - Yes, sir. - l'll leave it to you, Lewis. - Sir. Mr Phillipson. lnspector, the play was terrible. l didn't stay. - And? - l met someone. Who? l can't say. l think you're going to have to. (Sighs) l was telling the truth when l said l wasn't having an affair with Valerie Craven. What l didn't say was that l was having an affair with her mother. (Footsteps) - She doesn't want to go in. - That's all right. Nor do l, really. Julia, let's go for a walk, shall we? Miss Baines was a very special person, wasn't she? Yes. Look, l'm very happy to talk about this another day. - l loved her. - Right. lt was mutual. Although she couldn't express it, of course, because of her position. And could you? Not say it, no, but l know she knew and she knew l knew. And Valerie? Was Valerie special to her as well? Sort of. Yes, but you know Valerie. She's very... Well, she loves people being captivated. Right. - Where is she now? - l don't know. What about when she wrote? Yes, Miss Baines wanted to see the envelope, but l'd thrown it away. Twit! Why do you think Miss Baines sent the letter to Valerie's mother? l don't know. She said it was really important for Mrs Craven to know. She was very annoyed with Valerie for not saying where she'd gone to or who with. l think she thought it wasn't fair on her mum. Good. This is the worst day of my life. lt must be. She was a fantastic person, so fantastic. You could tell her anything. She just understood. She understood everything. And she was so beautiful. She'd never decorate herself for a man or anything, only for her own pleasure. l'm sorry. She showed me things. l went to her house and everything. She showed me books. She told me l must look, look, look. Look, Morse. Look, look, look. (Video plays again) You'll forgive me if l do this? Oh, no, carry on. You've changed your hair. Yes. This is my own colour, you know. The blonde was a phase. l'll have to see if l can be loved ''for myself alone - and not for my yellow hair''. - Oh. Oh, that's Yeats, Inspector. ''Only God, my dear, could love you for yourself alone and not for your yellow hair.'' - Yes. - l don't think anyone else has noticed. Donald Phillipson? No. No. Has it been er... Your friendship, the details aren't my business, but er...is it a recent thing or what? Through all the yellow-hair phase. - ls there a connection? - Oh, l would think so, wouldn't you? - Does your husband...? - No. No. Where were you last Tuesday evening? - l think you already know that. - lf you wouldn't mind telling me. Donald went to a play. He telephoned me and he wanted to meet. And did you? We meet at Homewood, in the changing rooms beside the swimming pools. That's where we go. They're painted a sort of green colour, the wood, and it peels. Inside, I mean. The fIoor's concrete. We've been very organised. l have the duvet in the back of my car, Donald has a cushion in his. Normally, his son sits on it. You can smell orange juice, you know? Ice IoIIies. Always, with my head on it, l'm reminded of his children. And you were there on Tuesday evening? Yes. What er... Where was your husband whiIe aII this was going on? My husband is on committees. He's a great man for running things. He thinks l go out to learn how the Japanese arrange their flowers. lnstead, l've learned how the English arrange their marriages. - Aren't these lovely? - Very. l love my garden. Did Valerie ever realise there was something between you? Donald and me? l don't think it had started before she left. So, in fact, it's been within the last few months? l should think so, then. l don't know. Perhaps your hairdresser will remember. l don't know. You realise you may have to testify on Donald Phillipson's behalf? - ls that definite, then? - No, and l hope you won't need to, that you won't have to. Thank you. Smell. - l'll show you out. - No, no, no. lt's straight through, isn't it? Yes, that's right. Bye. Goodbye. (Car approaches) CRAVEN: Morse! CRAVEN: What do you think you're doing? Do you know the damage you've done? All night, she was sobbing. Just lay there awake, sobbing. Do you realise what you said? That our daughter didn't want to come home. Well, you think about it. You just think. l only hope that you're here to apologise. Don't imagine for one minute l'm going to leave it here. l'm asking questions about you, Morse. Wherever I go, I ask questions. l'd like to ask you a question, Mr Craven. Where were you between eight o'clock and midnight on Tuesday evening? (Beeps horn) l'm just going to speak to the Baines' neighbour. Want to come? - No, l want to catch Sheila Phillipson. - OK. How was Mrs Craven? She's had her hair dyed. She backs up Phillipson. They were doing things to each other at the swimming pool. Guess what. According to his wife, David Acum got home very late on Tuesday night. He was at a meeting in Oxford. George Craven was at the Masonic Lodge, ten minutes' walk from Cheryl Baines. Witnesses as long as your arm. And the masonic arm, as we know, is very long. (Horn) - Maguire? - At his mum's. l checked it out. Hard to imagine him having one. OK. See you later. MAN: No. No. - No. MAN: No! MAN: No. He's too tall, see? That's another problem. He was more the size of that other one. LEWlS: That's a woman poIice constabIe. She'd be a Iot shorter than any of our men constabIes. Now, you're quite sure in your mind that it was a man you saw? l told you. l'm worried about her cats. She loved those cats, doted on them. Who's going to Iook after those poor things? Yes. Could we try it now, please? WeII, that's right! LEWlS: Bingo! POLlCEMAN: Bingo. That's him, all right. Right coat. Right size. Right colour. Well done, Martha. Of course, l can't be definite. lt was in the night-time, but... Yes, that's him. That was a policewoman, Martha. And l think it was a woman you saw entering the premises on the night of the attack. Mrs Phillipson? Oh, l'm sorry. l startled you. No, l was miles away. Sorry. lnspector Morse, sorry. Thomas of Anlaby? Yes, l'm doing him. He's my chap. l'm writing a little book about Anlaby, where l was brought up. lt's a village in Yorkshire. Tom's my protagonist. 1 3 something to 1 3 something. 72, probably. - Have you come to see me? - Yes. - Would it be better if we went outside? - No, no. Here's fine. So? You see, a girl has gone missing and a woman has died. And the connection is your husband's school. But a school can't be guilty of a crime, can it? At least, not directly. So, l'm trying to find the relationship between these two events and l just thought l'd speak to you. l see. Research. Detection. Similar trades, really. The old dirt. The relatively recent dirt. l know about my husband and Grace Craven, lnspector, if that is what you are trying to say. Well, l wasn't, but l'm er... Right. He told me yesterday evening. He'd brought me flowers, which is... always an ominous sign. Presents and guilt. Someone should research that, lnspector, so... But l knew, anyway, but he told me yesterday. - So, it didn't come as a shock to you? - No. No. Cheryl Baines was a shock, but Grace Craven... Look, when l met my husband, l was the most... Start again. When l say l was brought up in Anlaby, actually, l'm a descendent. lt's my family. When l met Donald, that was the most important thing about me, as far as he was concerned. He wasn't bedding me. He was bedding a couple of hundred acres. l'm not saying he didn't love me or doesn't still love me. That's him. He has a great many qualities, but there are certain things that he finds quite...sexy. George Craven is a very powerful man. l expect it was thrilling for Donald to get into his bed. l'm sorry. No. What's worse? To discover your husband's having an affair or that he's killed somebody? Let's go for the little stab, rather than the shove down the stairs. Why one or the other? Well, Donald also told me that you had him down as chief suspect. ls that right? Sir! (Music drowns conversation) Thank you. So, what time did you go to Miss Baines's house? About... Nine o'clock. l'm not absolutely sure of the time. And if l was seen going in by this neighbour, then l assume you know what time, anyway. Anyway, Donald had the car. So I cycIed. There was a Iight from the upstairs window, but when I got to the front door, I noticed it was aIready open, so I went in. She wasjust Iying there. MORSE: Why did you go? l don't know, really. l wanted to confront her, l suppose. - About? - Donald. l thought she was blackmailing him. l don't mean money. l mean... There was obviously something going on. She hadn't always been Deputy Head, for instance. That was Donald's doing and utterly uncharacteristic. Why do you say that? Cheryl Baines didn't go in for men, lnspector. With the Donalds of this world, women like that don't fare very well. But, suddenly, a few months ago, he makes her Deputy Head and all sorts of other things. Deferring to her on matters where he had very strong opinions. l don't know. l wanted to know what was going on. l had some thoughts, of course. Which were? l had a terrible fear that he was having an affair with Valerie Craven. Which is why you were relieved when he told you it was her mother. Yes, l suppose... Yes. Probably. Relieved? l don't know. l know what it looks like, lnspector, but l didn't kill Miss Baines. l have no lover to vouch for me but I didn't kiII her. I turned and fIed. - Straight home? - Yes. And you didn't see anyone else, nothing that struck you as odd? No, l just cycled home. l don't know. l was... Well, of course, - that was strange. - What was? Well, l was coming round the corner by the pub. And I noticed a man sitting in a car. And it was David Acum. (Bell rings) ACUM: Don't throw that. Homework in ink, pIease. That goes for everybody. Steven, that goes for everybody. - lnspector. - Got a minute? A minute? Yes, sure, but l'm on my way to another lesson. You'll have to walk with me, if that's OK. You know about Cheryl Baines? Yes, l saw it on the news. Terrible. lt's incredible. l saw it on the news last night. We're treating her death as murder. You're joking? No joke. I can't beIieve it. Where were you on Tuesday evening? l was in Oxford. You know that. You rang my home. l'm going to have to ask you to come to the station with me. But I can't. I'm teaching. I said. l can't just walk out of the school. Why can't you ask me these questions here, now? You know... Wait outside, you lot. Come on! Why do l have to come down to the station all of a sudden? God! Because, Mr Acum, we have a list of suspects and you're at the top of it. Oh, Mr Maguire. Sergeant Lewis. Now what? Come on. Now what have l done? - lf l could just have a brief word? - No. No. No way. l want a lawyer. Why's that, now, sir? Because you're on my case, you bastards, from morning... l'm going to find half a ton of dope under my bed and ''How did that get there?'' Ah, no. No, no, no, no. l was just wondering... in what way are you related to Valerie Craven? Say again. Would you rather talk upstairs? No. l'd rather get on with my life. You know? l've got clients waiting and l'm going to get a ticket if l don't move my motor. So, come on. What's all this garbage about Valerie Craven? Well, l've got a form in the car. lt's from a private hospital, as it happens, just around the corner. And it's for Valerie's termination. On the form, as next of kin, she puts a Mr John Maguire of this address. So, l'm assuming she meant you. Are you married? Stupid bitch. The stupid... Hello. l'm sorry, but we have... I had to come. We do need to speak. l'm sorry. Can l come inside? Sir. Lewis. What's yours? No, l'm fine. So, tell me. And don't look at me like that, Lewis. l'm thinking, and when l'm thinking l get thirsty. Right. Maguire? Oh, Mr Maguire! Actually, l think l will just have a half. - A half, please. Bitter. - Thank God for that. No. Maguire. Very rattled. - Good. - He did help Valerie. Arranged for her to go to the cIinic. Lent her some money. So, yes, she was...pregnant and, yes, she did stop with him for a couple of nights afterwards. But, no, he wasn't the father and, no, she didn't tell him who was. Cheers. - Said he hasn't seen or heard of her since. - Well, he would. Why did he lend her the money? He's not the charitable type, is he? Oh, no. l think, and l'm guessing here, but l got out my diary and by my reckoning she wouldn't quite have been 1 6, when she and Maguire were... You know. Were er...you know. You're such a prude, Lewis. Anyway, that's my guess. Hm. And why, if Maguire isn't the father, despite the erm...you know, why didn't the real father help her organise all this? Maguire didn't know, he says. But, apparently, and this is Maguire's guess, he was under the impression that she thought that the real father wouldn't be too keen on her having a... That was his impression. When it comes to biology, it's a foreign language to you, isn't it? Anyway... Lewis, are you a Catholic? No, sir. Just the usual, you know. Oh. The usual. Right. Eh, what about Acum? Oh, l don't know. - Catholic, you mean? - No, sir. l meant, what's happening? Did you see him? Yes. Oh, yes. Yes, l've got him down at the station. And? - l can't imagine Acum killing anybody, can you? - l don't know. There's something not right there. What do you know about St John Baptiste de la Salle? Er... lt doesn't matter. Come on. MORSE: You see, I think it might weII have been an accident. Or perhaps not so much an accident as a tussle. Do you know what l mean? A tussle at the top of the stairs. A struggle. An argument about something. An outburst. Temper. And then, without meaning to, without premeditation, the man or woman, whoever it was, suddenly has a dead body at the bottom of the stairs. Yes. Maybe. l... l don't know. Maybe. Oh, God. Yes. You come to Oxford for the evening, for the first time, you say, since you stopped teaching at Homewood. Although, why you stopped, we don't know. lt was a nice posh school. Good money. ''Principles,'' you said to me, wasn't it? On principle. Yes, and then, one night, you come here and the next thing we know, a teacher from the schooI is dead. And who is seen around the corner? You, David. So. Tell us. l don't know. l don't know what to say. WeII, you have a think, eh? Why don't you have just a little think on your own, OK? OK. Thanks. So, it was Acum. l had my money on anyone except him. You might still be right. No, sir, l think you got it, about the pushing and shoving at the top of the stairs. A bit sad, really. Got a motive, have you, Lewis? Not really. Except l wondered whether there was anything between them. Some romantic thing? Possible? Then a falling out? l don't know. l'm driving Acum back to Reading. Do you want to come? Why's that? Catholics, Lewis. Catholics and faces. Who's that, would you say? Oh, I don't know, sir. And why not? Well, l can't see her face now. Exactly. Exactly. Right. l'm very uncomfortable about being here, Grace. - l hope it's... - You hope it's what? l don't want you to tell me you've had a dream or whatever it was last time. At the moment, l'm just saying you're not the only one who feels haunted. Ah, now, the last time we spoke, on Wednesday morning, l think the need was all yours. And at some point, l seem to remember, any time, any place was fine. Grace, please don't ask me to keep saying thank you. lt wears me down. Please? OK. l've got half an hour at the very most, not even that. l really wish we could have arranged a better... Anyway. Anyway... Hello, Donald. l'm happier catching a train. - l brought you here. l'll take you home. - l'd prefer it, really. Besides, there are things we need to talk about, with your wife. l don't know which of you instigated this, but l have to say it can only be hurtful. It can onIy possibIy be hurtfuI. Grace and l have never had a conversation by ourselves before, - just the two of us. - Really? Yes. What l've realised, because l don't think either of us is particularly stupid, although maybe we are, is how plausible you are, so very plausible. ls this going to lead somewhere or are we just doing character assassination? ln which case, l wonder if l might have a drink? - You can have a drink. - Thank you. - WeII? - Well? l don't want to defend myself, but the woman is unbalanced. You've said this yourself. l'm not excusing myself. l haven't helped. l'm probably partly to blame for the girl going off. l'm just saying, the desire for revenge, for striking out? That's all. l've told you everything, Sheila, and l'm not proud. But l believe in our marriage, in our children. What has she said? The woman is unbalanced. Half the stuff she thinks has happened, she's actually dreamed. You realise that, don't you? Do you know what l did this morning? l bought you some perfume. l wanted to come home and start again. (Door opens) Has Sheila told you? My husband just called to tell me David Acum is being detained by the police in connection with the murder of Cheryl Baines. Really? David Acum? l don't believe it. Well, that's what George told me just now. How extraordinary. What possible reason could he have? Cheers. Er... Can l just go on ahead? lt's just my wife... l'd rather not... l don't want to confront her with two policemen, without giving... - Fine. Give us a shout as soon as you're ready. - Thanks. He's not going to do a bunk, is he? Acum? No. You know what's happened, don't you? Yes, l think so. l think so. l think l probably do. l can't find her. l think she must have gone out somewhere. Do you want to wait or would you rather come back some other time? - lt's up to you, although she could be... - That's fine. We'll wait. OK. Well...come in. l'm sorry about the... - Shall l make you a cup of tea or something? - No, l don't think so. - Sit down, please. - Thanks. lt's a bit ridiculous, though, isn't it? She could be hours. I don't know. She couId be reaIIy Iate. Valerie! What? Valerie! She might as well come down. Sir? Valerie Craven, l know you're up there. Oh, God. MORSE: HeIIo, VaIerie. Well, after all that, it was D Acum. Which is good, because now you can tell Sheila what really happened on Tuesday evening. ln what sense now? Well, she thinks we were together. And we were, Grace. l wish we weren't, but l can't see the point in denying it. l've told my wife everything. Donald, l have already explained to Sheila that l haven't seen you for months. That I tried to. That I tried very hard to. That l was beguiled. That l lost my daughter because of you. I've expIained that. What can l say, Sheila? (Sheila sighs) - Sheila, he's lying. - What possible reason could l have for lying? I'm admitting I spent the evening with another woman. He's here. His car. - Valerie! - Leave her. Why do l need an alibi if the police have arrested David Acum? No. No more duplicity. l did something very wrong. l've done wrong and l've had to pay for it. l may have to leave Homewood, although l hope you'll be generous enough not to push me into that. More than anything, I Iove my schooI. Now, I know you're very sensitive to... - Mum! - Valerie! - l thought you were dead. - l'm back now. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Oh, God. l think we should go, darling. This is a family time. - lnspector, you brought Valerie? - Yes. - That's marvellous. - Yes. - Where did you find her? - She's been in Reading. ln Reading? Have you? - Oh, God, l can't believe you're back. PHlLLlPSON: SheiIa. - We really should... - Yes. lf you don't mind, l think l'd like you to stay for a few moments. - Why's that? - l think you know why, Mr Phillipson. Well, l'm sorry, but l haven't the faintest idea. Tell me again where you were between eight and midnight on Tuesday evening. Well, this is going to be impossible, because, as it happens, l've just been discussing this with my wife and Mrs Craven. Now that VaIerie has come back, her mother is going to find it even more difficuIt to hang on to the truth. l was lying, lnspector. He wasn't with me. PHlLLlPSON: You see? The fact of the matter is that six months ago, or so, Valerie came home early from school with a headache or some such problem, whatever you choose to call it, and, unfortunately, discovered her mother and me together upstairs. And it was very painful and erm... Well... The point is now, naturaIIy, naturaIIy, there are going to be deniaIs. You weren't with Mum. You were at Miss Baines's house the night she was killed. - No. - I know you were. Because l saw you there. l was there. I went to see Baines. I needed to taIk to somebody about what was happening to me. I was getting homesick. And you know, she toId me to come home. I was Ieaving the house, I'd Ieft the house... ..when I saw his car draw up. And he went in. That's why David couIdn't say anything. l was there. He would have had to have told you about me. These are women who are distressed. l run a school full of them. Their emotions get the better of them. Tomorrow, there'll be different stories. There's no Iogic. There's no logic. So, Mrs Craven says you weren't with her. - VaIerie says she saw you at the Baines'house. - l did. l thought you'd got your murderer. lt's Acum. - David didn't kill Baines. PHlLLlPSON: David? Of course. Reading. She's gone off with D Acum. ls that who you were with? Oh, God. Yes, l'm sorry. l should have come and told you, but l couldn't. - I couIdn't taIk to you. - Now l understand. We've got one of them lying to protect her own reputation and to stop her husband beating her up, and the daughter is lying to protect the boyfriend. Shut up! Shut up! Just stop for one second. Just stop lying. Please, Donald. Please, stop lying, will you, it's so... Just stop, OK? OK. OK. - OK. - Let's go, shall we? Certainly. l didn't actually push her, as it happens, not that l expect anyone to believe me. There was a struggle and she... lt was actually very simple. She wanted me out and l wanted her out. lt's the school. lt's very precious. She wanted it and l had it. And it was true what l said. lt was nothing. lt was... l don't know what it was. Not Iove, certainIy. Then VaIerie waIks in and finds us in bed. Tells Baines. Suddenly, at every corner, every decision, she's got her hand on the telephone to call George Craven. That's intolerable, isn't it? Let me tell you, it is intolerable. lt was blackmail. Just because she didn't ask for money... lt was my school. You see? Ohh. You can come with your husband, Mrs Phillipson, or we can arrange for a car. Thank you. l have to pick up the children from school. LEWlS: Sir? We'll need to talk to you both, but not just yet. - Thank you for finding my daughter. MORSE: I'm sorry it took so Iong. Are you sure you're all right? Oh, yes. Quite all right. Thank you. They don't know, do they - Acum, the Cravens? They don't know about Valerie and the clinic? No. That's why she went to Maguire. The mother, Acum, they're both Catholics. She had to go somewhere, so she went to Maguire. - Are we going to tell them? - No. Nothing to do with us. lt was a missing persons case... ..and we found her.
