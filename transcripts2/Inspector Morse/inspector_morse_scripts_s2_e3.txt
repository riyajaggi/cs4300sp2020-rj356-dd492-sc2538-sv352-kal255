 Inspector Morse (1987â€“2000): Season 2, Episode 3 - The Settling of the Sun - full transcript 
 Morse is pressed into service when, while attending a college dinner for an eclectic group of foreign summer students, a Japanese member of the group suddenly excuses himself and a short time later is found brutally murdered in his room. There are any number of suspects, several of whom had bad experiences with the Japanese during World War II and at least one student that is clearly not what he claims to be. When traces of drugs are found on the Japanese student's clothing the drug squad is now involved. But when a second member of the group is murdered, Morse is convinced that this is far more than a simple case of drug smuggling gone awry.

 Hello, Jane. Hello. Sorry I'm late. How is your father? It was a disturbing exhibition. Some very powerful images of the crucified Christ. Varnisher of the rising sun, eight letters? Japanner. Ah. Do you fancy a walk? Anybody who hasn't handed in their completed crossword, please? Thank you. Once you have your luggage, go to the Porter's lodge for keys.

 Excuse me, have I got all of these? You will laugh at me. No. There's a prize. What will it be? I don't know. Something appropriate. If I give it you, you will not laugh? No, you might win the prize. You have two keys, sir. The small one is a Yale key. It opens the door in the outer gate. We close that at 10.30 every night, so take it with you if you go out. Then there's this key, the larger key, the Chubb, which opens your room door. All right? Name, sir? Yukio Li. How are you spelling it? Mr Li?

 With a Y, Thomas. Mr Yukio. Oh! Staircase three. Ichi! Yes. Now you have two keys... I'll show you. Kochira! She enjoys showing off her Japanese. Heidi Vettinger. Now, young lady, you've two keys. Where were our bobbies then? On the street with a cake and a bull's-eye lantern. Are you a teacher? No. I'm not either. The food was eatable, but I prefer less emphasis on meat. You should've gone away. Oh, no. You look tired. Do I? I know, of course you do. Your friend's not hungry. I'm not. If you are bored, excite yourself. I don't like skiing. Have you any idea of the work involved organising a summer school? Some students don't eat meat, some don't drink. They're the ones we don't meet. What are you talking about? The Methodists. The ones that don't drink. Don't end up in court, do they? Something has disagree with me. Sorry. Excuse me. I go to my room. I think one of the students is unwell. Something "disagreed" with him. So he said. I'm born in Koln. I've lived there since 1937. Yes? What a long time. Ja. I knew the war. You asked if I remember the war years. I do. I said hardly anyone remembers them and they're best forgotten. No, the war will never be forgotten. Never. Please. I'm sorry. Never. Was it all right? What? The crossword. I thought it excellent. I didn't know you smoked. Well, not often. Thank you for doing the crossword. Thank you. Excellent. Master? Perhaps the Inspector will give the prize away soon, then I can make my address and go. Certainly, Master. I wonder if they know I pinched most of the crossword. Pardon? Not most of it, some of it. I put in Japanner, varnisher of the rising sun, for you. I thought you'd like it. Sorry? Never mind. I've tried to see you and I rang. I know you did. I'm sorry. It's been a shock. It is a shock when... when it happens. He was very frail though, Jane. He was frail. So long as the crossword was all right. I'm glad you asked me. I knew I'd enjoy doing it. Jane, precious one, can we get on with it? It's boring the arse off me and heaven knows what it's doing to the inspector. Before Sir Wilfred Mulryne addresses us, Chief Insp Morse of the Thames Valley Police will present the crossword competition prize. Not only a policeman, he's also an inveterate solver of the crossword puzzle. Chief Inspector Morse, would you? It's all clues, isn't it? Crosswords are far more exotic and exciting than police work. Most murders, don't require solving, because they haven't been planned, Thought a lot about perhaps, over the years not as murders, but as silence. The silence of a wife a husband, a son, or a daughter even. No more words, talk, screams, arguments, insults. Insults more often lead to murder than anything else in my experience. Domestic Bursar speaking. Mrs Warbut, one of the summer students is unwell. Yukio Li. All right, dear, it's all right. "He's gone to his room." "I thought the porter could go and find out how he is." I'm sorry about this. I would like to know if he isn't feeling better...at once. "I'd like to know." Porter. The winner is... Kurt Friedman. Well done. The idiot! Welcome. Advice. Get a little guide book. It will tell you where the colleges and public toilets are. Things, fascinating as such. And if you happen to get lost, stolen or stray please feel free to ask one of our policemen. Saepe est sub pallio sordido sapientia. Wisdom is often hidden under a shabby cloak. THOMAS! Before I fall out for the night go and see how son of Tojo is. Ask him nicely. No need to bow. If he's better, or does he need a quack? Room one, staircase three. Dr Robson is concerned. She's to be told of his condition. It's probably the trots. DON'T clean up after him. That isn't your job. Let him lie in it. You don't like them, do you, Mrs Warbut. I have VERY good reasons not to. I know you have, Mrs Warbut. There's a lot to see. A great deal to see. Don't be confused by the multiplicity of it, nor confounded by the contemplation of minutiae. Enjoy Oxford, not because of this or that discovered but I do beg of you... ..embrace us wholeheartedly. With open minds and open arms. (Not the hole joke!) Only in that way can knowledge be gained. I talk not of this college nor of that - Excuse me, Master. Not of this college nor of that, but of the University as a whole. Nobody is to leave! And, gentlemen, what a hole Oxford is! What? A tongue, Morse. Wounds to the hands, ankles, wrists, feet. Mouth slit ear to ear. Knife sticking in the chest. A shambles. Hello, Lewis. Where have you been? Look in the bathroom, he washed the blood off there. Look down the plughole. Where were you? I was home. I was here. You were here. Wasn't I though! Well, go on. Have a look And don't step on anything. He was very dead, but I think, still warm. Do you hear that, Max? That's MY contribution. Do you know what that means? Still warm? It means not long dead. Precisely. While I was here. Will it give you nightmares? No. He's seen too many pulled out of Isis Lock, haven't you, Lewis? Not cut about like that, I haven't. I make the time of death between eight and nine this evening. Do you? I do. Not a lot of blood, considering. Too much for me. We've been here for over half an hour. His nibs is playing up, sir. Good. May we now leave? There's been a murder, Sir Wilfred. You sure? You can go, but I shall want to talk to you. Where will you be? In my lodgings. Where else? What about the servants? You worried about overtime? Yes, I am, Inspector. Times are hard. Otherwise, we wouldn't have to put up with all these people we know nothing about all the year round. Do you know very little about the students? Not very much. One of the summer students has been the victim of an attack a Japanese gentleman, by the name of Yukio Li. He left the dinner table feeling unwell. We all saw him, I think. Do any of you know him or anything about him? Who sat next to him at dinner? I did. You did, Miss? But I don't know him. We've got to start somewhere or we'll be here all night. Sergeant Lewis will take some statements from you. Do we want an interpreter, sir? No, they're not beginners. Good. What about documents? You all right? Yes, thank you. Good. What about application forms, that sort of thing? They're in the Bursar's office. Can you get them? I have a key. I can go anywhere. Now? Yes. Keys... Is it necessary? It is, Jane. Right. Let's see if we can find another room, shall we? You sure you're all right? Yes, thank you. Look, very often, when something frightening happens, particularly if it's someone close to you - Look, I didn't even know him! I wasn't close to him! No, no. I mean your father. Just one key? Yes. Have you all got them? No, just senior fellows of the college. We can go anywhere. Otherwise we couldn't keep places locked. Then you might have to tidy up. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm fine. There's talk of having it cut down. There always is. What I wanted to say is that if something sad has happened, we sometimes resent sharing. I mean, even if you've been forced to share it. What happened. I'm talking about your father. I mean, perhaps more so if you're forced to share it with an outsider. Although I don't consider myself an outsider. I did think we were friends I do understand. This is hardly the time. I know. What do you want us to do? Nothing. I'm trying to tell you that I understand your feelings. Will you want to talk to me? Yes. I'm talking about the course. What? What do you want us to do? Many students have spent lots of money and want to do the course. Should we? I don't see why not. Once we've talked to them, it's up to you. Perhaps we shouldn't. Don't know. Should we? It's up to you. If you feel it isn't right... What was his name? Ah... I'm sorry. Yukio Li. They're in alphabetical order. Yes. Under L? No. No, no. Li was his Christian name. Or rather... Of course... he might well be Christian. There's no reason to think not. I mean, why do we assume not? Jane, sit down. Some are Christian, aren't they? Some of them. Just like us. Sit down, Dr Robson. Can I get you anything? A glass of water? I'll make a cup of tea. Yes. Why don't you? I don't want a cup of tea. What am I going to do about the course? What am I going to do? You can go on with it. I told you. As far as we're concerned, if we get through everything tonight. Here he is. In English. Do you know anything about him? He had a wife. I knew nothing about him. Someone will have to tell his wife. There's time for that. You can have your cup of tea and then go. It's a matter of talking to everyone. It's the only way things are done. It'll take a long time. I don't think you should stay up. Thank you. How do you say his name? Yukio Li. Rushing off? He died between eight and nine... I know that. Possibly, approximately. I saw him leave the dinner and I discovered him dead. I know when he died. You've the advantage of me. I apply science. There has to be a first time I suppose. Is that him? You know me and bodies. I do. Yes, that was him. Are you sure? Look for yourself. Positive. Not like you. What? Time of death. Positive ID. I haven't eaten. A clear brain, sharpened by hunger. Under: Any physical disability. Umm. He's put: "The sight of the eye mean I play no games for no perception of the ball". Hardly need me, do you? Someone's got to clear up the mess. Under written English, he's entered: "Good". He was a liar. How can you work with that on? I don't notice it. Remind you of home, does it? It's quite funny. I can't understand a word they say. I can. He gave me a crash course in Geordie for foreigners. Cambridge. That's right. Why are you in Oxford? Earning a few bob, OK? What as, teacher? No, helper. All right? It's quite all right, son. Sorry. That's fine. I arrange the trips. Look after everyone in the coaches. Set the quiz, collect the crosswords. What did you do yesterday? Came up with the coach from Victoria station. What did you do today? Nothing much. Settled in. Did everyone do that? I suppose so. What made him ill? The Japanese gentleman? I don't know. Come on, what do you think? Something he ate, drank? I don't know. What are you reading? Medicine. All right. Expert witness. What do you think? He didn't eat anything. Left everything on his plate. He drank orange juice, some bread. Not hungry? I don't know. What did he eat on your coach? I don't know. Have you talked to the girl, Lewis? Yeah. What did she see him eat? The Japanese? I didn't ask her. Did you see the Japanese during the day? He was around. Where? In town, where? I don't know. In the bar. Was he drinking orange juice? Yeah. Did you buy him one? Me? Did he talk to anyone? Yep. Who? German man, Friedman, and Dr Robson. And all he had was orange juice? That would upset me. You go a funny colour if you eat too many oranges. He was a funny colour. Have you finished with me? I have. Can I go? Yes, I've finished, for now. Jane Robson. He was talking to her? Got any feelings about the Japanese? What do you mean? Lot of people have. Young people? I doubt it. I find that sort of thing pointless. He's in a bit of a state. Were you watching him? Yes, I was. I expect he wanted to play snooker. Do you fancy a game? No. I'd prefer to get through these and get home. Two people weren't in that hall. Mrs Warbut, the domestic bursar, and Ralph Thomas, the porter. Fancy either of them for it? No. No. Neither do I. Mr Friedman. Ja. You've been given another room. Thank you. I'll come up with you, sir. Move to the other staircase. Number 23. Thank you. Can I go up? Not yet. You'll be going to the other staircase. Why can't I go to my room? Why can't I? I want to go to my room! Your room is being changed. Why? Pull yourself together, man. Wait here, sir. I'll take you up after this gentleman to get your things. I saw the body. Proper mess it was. Blood everywhere, see. You see him go out? The best thing for shock, brandy and warmth. I'm glad to say it is never really warm in this room. Always a good excuse for a fire. How do you feel, now? Fine. Shocking business. It appears to be. It is. What lovely rooms. Aren't they? Are they just for you? All mine! Thank you very much, Sir Wilfred. Don't hesitate to knock on the door. Good night. Inspector, come in. CHIEF Inspector. Absolutely, yes, I know. Do you insist upon it? Not always. Please do. I care for form. I understand the reasoning. Much the same kind of thing happens in the army. Lance corporals are called corporal. Does wonders for them. I know all about these things. Approve of them. Shall you sit? What do you think? A murder's been committed in your college and you're not concerned. Totally wrong. I'm very concerned for the usual reasons. Loss of trade. The poor man was a victim of a ferocious attack, Sir Wilfred. Poor man. Was he? How terrible. You will spare me the details, I've seen deaths in abundance. Every so often a poor inadequate is slopped out of these colleges, even this one, in a plastic bag. I won't sit, if you don't mind. It is him, isn't it? I should say so. Why did they do that to his face? Yes... It was his tongue. Was it? Hmm. That's a relief. I wasn't looking forward to having to place it anywhere else. Severed, by a knife. Thank you. Stomach, orange juice, crisps. More than I've had! Arthur! Apart from the lacerations, slashes to wrists and ankles - I think it might be a ritual. A Japanese carry-on? I have not finished. There are holes in the palms of the hands. And feet. You'll see examples of these in every place of worship that is Christian. Crucifixion? Stigmata. The badge of suffering. Young girls suffer from such eruptions spontaneously from living in convents. But he got his from a sharp knife. And the one in his chest? Clear off. Glad to. Sarge. Up the back. What have you got for me? Take a look for yourself. Bloody hell! Why are all books written by men? Why? Why? They aren't. Why are all THESE books written by men? That is true. Fair enough. Is it? I don't think so. No, you probably wouldn't. He was unwell. You sat by him on the coach and he was unwell then? Ja. What sort of unwell? Pain the stomach, nausea, that sort of thing? Ja, that is the sort of thing. Did he complain to you? I think so. You're from Cologne? I am, ja. I know Cologne. I was stationed there - National Service. In which case I not so well as you, possibly because I've lived there only a few years. I am born in Leipzig. You know Leipzig? No. The other side. I've lived there all my life. Until I come to Koln. Marien Platz. Excuse please? Where I was stationed. Oh, er... Munchen? Munich? No, Cologne. Koln. You know where I mean? Oh, ja, ja. Of course I do. By the river. Is that so? Ja. May I have a drink, please? Did you talk to Mr... ..Yukio Li? What will this be about? I'm asking you. He was very suspicious. Of what? He seemed suspicious to me, you know. Furtive. Did he eat anything? Anything that might have upset him? Orange juice. He just ate orange juice. Did you like him? Excuse please? Did you, er... get on... ..talk? Pass the time of day? We read and do the crossword. Where did you sit in the coach? At the back. I would never have thought that someone like you, a foreigner, could have done the crossword so well. Thank you. Did Jane Robson congratulate you? Dr Robson? Know her well, do you? No. I thought you did. What were you talking to her about this morning? When was this? This morning, earlier. Ah, ja. We talk about the course. Right. I can go now? Yes, thank you. Thank you. Impressive. Who did this? I found it on the coach. At the back. I think we ought to look at all the crosswords, don't you? What's this? There was a cassette. Down the back of the seat. Here's a lab report on his clothes and the cassette contents. Dope. Heroin. In the cassette. Which was in the Jiffy bag, which was addressed to the murdered man. And traces on his clothes. Ah, that's good. That's very good. Now they'll swing into it, won't they? All the flash lads from London, with flowers in their buttonholes but most of all, you know who! What did I tell you, Lewis? Superintendent Dewar. I'm not happy when drugs are involved. Too many motivations, too wide, too obvious. All sorts of people. I know what you mean. What was found in his stomach? Bread, biscuits, that sort of thing. Crisps. Orange juice. That's all he drank. Yep. Was he a user? Some traces on his clothes. How much was in the cassette? Not much, traces. But I expect it had been full. Yes. I can't handle drugs. I can't work out why they do it. Beyond me. Oh, come on. You know. People, kids, down sometimes, I suppose. The same reason why you drink beer. Beer is food. It is with you! What about the ones you interviewed? What did you think? All the ones I've spoken to were terrified. Who? That German is. That lad from Cambridge. Jane Robson is. But none of them could have killed him. I'm their witness. They were all in the hall having dinner. None of them left except the Jap. Poor sod. Do you feel sorry for him, by the way? I haven't thought about it. No. Not if drugs is what he was into. Standard reaction. Right. The point is, Lewis, that nobody felt sorry for him before, did they? Before we found out about the possibility of the involvement of drugs. Which means they knew. Did they? Perhaps. I'd be a bit frightened if a murder happened in the room next to me. They were both in rooms on that staircase. The German, the Cambridge lad and Dr Robson. It was a shock, wasn't it? She's had a few shocks lately, yes. I'm taking this lot. Homework. Hello. What are you doing back? You're supposed to be elsewhere. He's a phoney. Who's a phoney? Was it a good game? I wasn't good. Did you win? Lots of roquets. We lost. I wasn't any good at all. You're trembling. Cold. It isn't cold, Jane. How did you get here? I came on my bicycle. Look, you don't have to be frightened about anything. Leave the bike. Shouldn't we talk? If you say so. I'll take you back. We can talk in the car. You going to change? Yes. Where shall I drop you? Christ Lane? No, I live in the college now. I didn't know that. The person who did the crossword puzzle did the one in The Times. And addressed your Jiffy bag. The German. German he might be, but he's cleverer than me. I couldn't do it that day. Please, stop the car. I want to walk. No, you don't want to walk. I don't want to talk. I won't ask you anything. We'll just drive and you can think about what you want to say. You like Elgar. You did. Fancy a cup of tea? I don't know. Yes, you do. Have a cup of tea. You never came here, did you? When? Why? You know, when... When we knew each other. Did you ask me? No. Probably not. Do you take sugar? Sit down, you might not like tea ceremonies. Best tea cups. I never use them, you know. I ought to sell this teapot. Somebody will only nick it one day. Never use the thing. Sit down, Jane. I will. Let's get on with it. I WILL! Good. There's somebody else involved. Yes. I can't tell you everything that happened. You have to. Just listen. I'm talking at least. No tea. I don't want tea. You might later. I've never had any feelings for you. That became obvious. It doesn't matter. It did. But it doesn't matter now. Yukio Li was a drug dealer. How did you know? He attended two summer schools. But first of all there was a young man I knew. Last year he died in a car crash. I was sad. Although he had a brilliant mind and could've had a brilliant future, his life was already destroyed. Mrs Warbut was brought a book by a scout last year. It had been left by Yukio Li. In it was names and addresses. Contacts - dealers, I suppose. You got it still? No. I destroyed it. Why did you do that? I shouldn't have, but I was thinking of the college. When Yukio Li applied again this year, I thought of refusing him. Was this young man an undergraduate? Yes. What was his name? Jeremy. Jeremy Collins. Who else knows this apart from you and Mrs Warbut? His father. I told him. The tea will be cold. I don't want any. Yes. Yes, speaking. Umm. What?! Where?! Umm. Right. No blood? No mutilations? None! Things are looking up. When? Last night. No later. The facial blow could've happened when he fell. Strangled, I think. Your Japanese. You wonder why there wasn't much blood, Morse? A knife in the heart. You'd expect blood to hit the ceiling. I suppose so. I would. Thought why there wasn't any? Or were you just grateful? I was grateful. All right. That knife didn't kill him. The report is on your desk. He was dead already. Oh, something else! The cuts to his wrists and ankles were done to hide the fact that he'd been tied up. But he'd been around all day getting pissed on orange juice. Everybody said so, he was seen. I saw him minutes before he was killed. His mouth. The cuts were to hide the fact that he'd been gagged. All right, boys, get a move on! He wasn't bound or gagged when I saw him. Bridge at 1:30. That's my opinion. Report's on your desk. Tied up and gagged for at least 24 hours. Rubbish! Does it complicate things for you? What does HE want? What is it? Gays? Suicide? It usually is. Nothing to do with us, suicide. Did you hear that, Max? I think you all ought to wait till I have a good look at the body. Oh, I will! It's suicide. Your gov'nor says so. The handwriting on the Jiffy bag, it's the person who did the crossword and won the prize. He's a phoney, our German. He'd never heard of Marien Platz. Neither have I. You wouldn't have. But even if he is a phoney, it doesn't make him a murderer. He's into heroin though, in the Jiffy bag. That's it then. Bound to be a murderer, isn't he? Drugs, drugs, drugs. It's a gift to men like Dewar. Mention drugs and all motivations fit. They love it. All unimaginative coppers like Dewar, they love it. And they love the righteousness of the cause. Trouble with Friedman is, he couldn't have done it. Phoney or not, drugs or not. None of them could have done it. None of them could've murdered that Japanese. I saw them all sitting there. ME. Why me? You're a good witness, aren't you? The best. Aren't I? Do you think I was set up, Lewis? I do. A very nasty thought has come to me. How long ago was I set up, do you think? You mean, Dr Robson? That's my nasty thought. Only you know about it. Is that why I can't think straight, Lewis? I don't know. Maybe we should... go backwards. Start thinking Japanese. Zen? Pardon? Puccini? Oh, Madame Butterfly, you mean? That's right. You can pack up now. Goodbye. Herr Friedman? No. Sorry. Why? Why do you want him? Can I help you? When did we first get to know each other? I can't remember. Last year, I suppose. Yes, it was last year. Yes. We found Graham Daniel today - dead. In a lavatory. Strangled probably. Though my superior thinks it might be suicide. Oh, no. Didn't you know him? No. I gave him a job, that's all. Not on drugs, was he, like Jeremy Collins? Drugs? Jeremy? I-I-I don't know. I mean, I know about Jeremy Collins, yes. But Graham, no. Jeremy... Jeremy Collins... Miss... er? Heidi, ja. Who is the phoney? Pardon me? You filled your crossword with "He is a phoney. He is a phoney." Who is? I just filled in anything. I couldn't do it. You did not mean anything? I just filled in the squares. Please... No. Wait. I am Swiss, we know Germans. He is not a German. What is he then? I don't know. You must ask him. Right. Thank you. Who gets to see the application forms? We all do. The Bursar, he's away for a few weeks. The staff in the office. Mrs Warbut. If Herr Friedman is not what he seems, and it seems he isn't, he would have to have an address in Germany for you to reply to. Yes, of course. Is he the father of Jeremy Collins? No. Are you sure? I know he isn't. Who is, Jane? Sir Wilfred. Is he? Did he tell you, you had to offer a place to Yukio Li? I suppose he must have done. He sees all the applications. Yes, I know he does. He told me. Tea. I'm having tea. Don't let me stop you. It's about your son, Sir Wilfred. Which one? Have you more than one? I'm sure I must have. Jeremy Collins. Oh, that one! Drugs! Need I say more, old chum? Drugs? Jeremy Collins was a piece of human scrap, for which I have no regard. Did you know Yukio Li? Know OF him or KNOW him? The first perhaps, the second... Did you know he was a drug peddler? Did I? I saw him as you did, a typical southern Japanese. Is there such a person? Do they all look alike to you, Morse? Not to you? No. Long service in hard stations, old chum. I had the opportunity of meeting and subsequently interrogating many Japanese in the Far East after the war. And during it, some of it. I got to know their physiognomy, had to, sitting opposite them for hours. Now, to you, the casual observer, they may all look alike, but... Southern Japanese, in particular. Thicker lips. Rounder eyes. I think you killed him. What if you did? How did I do? I don't know. Of course you don't. You had help. Did I though? Kurt Friedman, not a German. But that was no problem for you. You could've arranged that his application form showed he was. Where is Friedman? Did you give him a golden key? Why would I do that? So that he might hide. I'm going to search the college thoroughly, Sir Wilfred. Something I should have done before. I want all doors open. I want to look everywhere. I expect to find somewhere someone was kept bound and gagged for a day. I might also find Kurt Friedman in hiding. Graham Daniel is dead, did you know? How would I? How would you? Did I murder him? Perhaps he found out about you. Perhaps he was a friend of your son's. Perhaps he helped you murder Yukio Li and then threatened to talk. Jane Robson told you about Yukio Li. You blamed him for your son's death. No matter what you say, Sir Wilfred, you cared about your son. I don't know how you did it. I know you were all there, sitting looking at me. I was there to give you an alibi. That's why I was asked to set the crossword and give the prize. I didn't ask you, I thought you were a friend of Jane Robson. A friend? Yes, I was a friend. Yes, I AM a friend. The most suspicious thing of all is an excellent alibi. Also the most innocent. Might I answer the door? Allow me. Just in time to see me arrested, Superintendent. I don't think so, Sir Wilfred. I'm not talking of arrest, I'm talking of suspicions I have. I suspect you of involvement in the murder of Yukio Li. Here. You might as well see this. What is it? What we know about your Japanese. He was being watched. Sir Wilfred co-operated. He was part of an international drug syndicate. Who was watching him? I see. Lets us both out of it, doesn't it? Why would he be political? That's what we're not going to be told. Are we being bounced off? You are. I want you out of the way. You and Lewis. Now? Yes, now. This is too big for you to handle. You can go on with your investigation, but I want everyone out of here. What you do now must be discreet. In my opinion, Graham Daniel murdered the Japanese. Some argument over money or drugs. And who murdered HIM? If it was murder, we don't know...yet. It may be entirely fortuitous. It might still be suicide. We don't know...yet. What we do know is that the Japanese was deeply involved in drugs, in a big way, and there's still chance someone might try to contact him. Down the mortuary? They may not know that. Something will be thought of. A doppelganger? That's right. Who is it? One of the summer students watching him? It isn't necessary for you to know. Isn't it? Graham Daniel, was it? Never mind who it is. Ah, it wasn't. All right, sir. Is THIS the undercover agent? Didn't do much of a job letting him get killed. Don't you believe in co-operation, Miss? I'm sorry. That's all right. Did they all look alike to you? Pardon me? Know what a doppelganger is? Yes. Tell Superintendent Dewar. He doesn't. How did you know I was here? Where else? The German turned up yet, has he? No. Phoney. Thank you, Heidi. I have to talk to Jane Robson again. We've been told to leave it, sir. Is that a fact? Friedman's not a drug dealer, the Jap was. Friedman was involved with Jane Robson. They laid all this drugs lark. Planted that bloody silly Jiffy bag. Story about a notebook. Can you imagine it? Every name of every contact? You would, if you were a dealer. What neither of them knew, when they were setting him up as a dealer, was that he WAS one. And a big one, being watched. None of them villains. Not one. I told you that. Not one real criminal amongst the lot. Apart from our Japanese, the only person who appears to be villainous is Sir Wilfred Mulryne. And he hasn't done anything. I'm sorry, Lewis. I'd like you to ferret around a bit more. She used to live in Christ Lane. Who? Jane Robson. I want to know more about her. I knew her father. She had a brother, I think. You think? What did you talk about? I don't know. We talked about music. Usual things. Life. Music. Books, music. Crosswords. Everything. Not a lot. I don't know anything about her. Except her father had had a stroke. Go on. It's not drugs. Something more than that. There's just one thing nagging me. Mrs Warbut, last year, did you find a small book, a diary, and give it to Jane Robson? Come on. It's all right, she told me you did. That's right. Did you look in it? Read it? I had a quick look. What was in it? I don't know, it was in Japanese. Was it? I don't read Japanese. No, I don't suppose you do. Something I could never master. The only Japanese I know is rudimentary and peremptory. Yes. Thank you. Are there any other Japanese? Oxford's full of them at this time of the year. Tourists you see. In college? None. I thought I saw one. I think someone might try to kill me. Why? Because of that boy... ..dead. He was very like Jeremy Collins. Go on. I can see you're frightened of something, Jane. Is it silly of me? I can only help if you tell me more. Not here. Do you want to come to the station? No! Why should I? I thought, perhaps neutral ground. No. Come to my rooms. All right. No key? No. Your men are searching the college. Not my men. You weren't frightened on you own, were you, Alex? No, not really. Thank you. CHIEF INSPECTOR! Chief Inspector. There's a call for you! All right. I'm sorry. I'd better see what that is. This is my room. I'll be in here. "I've found our German, sir." Where is he? In Sunderland by now. His real name is Michael Robson, brother of Dr Robson. How do you know? His photo, and his daughter. She's waiting for him to come home. Christ Lane. All right. Get yourself over here. Who is it? Chief Inspector Morse. Worried about your brother? What? Gone back to Sunderland, has he? I don't know... Come on, Jane. I know you didn't murder Yukio Li, you couldn't do that. Knife in the heart, mutilations. There are people who can do such things when they're deranged with anger, but not you, Jane. You're going to suggest my brother did it. As a matter of fact he didn't. What I suspect is that the person we thought was Yukio Li was someone else. Another Japanese. The real Yukio Li was grabbed soon as he arrived. Trussed, gagged, dumped somewhere and fed on orange juice and biscuits - nothing else. And then, your brother, perhaps with Graham Daniel, and the help of the Japanese hired to impersonate Yukio Li later murdered him. And then we sat down to dinner, while the Yukio Li double pretended to be ill. We all saw him pretending to be ill having eaten nothing but orange juice and biscuits. I saw him. I was intended to be a witness. My brother didn't murder him. Who did? Not you. No. You're right about the double. There was an accident. Yes, I think you can call it that. Yukio Li tried to escape. There was a struggle between him and the Japanese who was guarding him. They fought and the Japanese killed Yukio Li by accident. It was an accident. You can call it that. Michael, my brother, just - Did the finishing touches. Michael was obsessed with hatred. It was dreadful. Was it? Do you know what happened to my father? No, you didn't tell me. Everybody knew. I didn't! Yes, you did! Yes, you did! Yes, you did! Everybody knew what had been done to him! How he'd been insulted. He's alive, you know. The man who maimed my dear, dear gentle father. Alive, and protected by the Americans. All right, Jane. All right. It is NOT all right! We've done everything! We have written. We've threatened. We have done everything to have him put on trial for his crimes. Mike - The man who tortured my father. He had him crucified in the camp. He was a scientist too. An apology for one. He worked on the effects of gas on human beings. Some Dutch, some Americans, some English. Among them my father. The Americans got him. But they didn't get his research, so they asked him to work for them. Let him stay alive, free from prosecution as a war criminal. After all... he had the only useful knowledge of the effects of gas on humans (!) Yukio Li was his son. Ah. Yes. We couldn't touch the father, but we could get the son. Do you know how we found out? That evil man told me. The pleasure he took in telling me. Who told you, Jane? Sir Wilfred. I was fond of his son, Jeremy. I went to Sir Wilfred to talk about him, to ask his help. He said some smart, cruel things about fathers and sons... ..and dropped the bombshell that Yukio Li was the son of the man who tortured my father. I was shattered. I hardly knew him, he was just a face. But suddenly, sitting there... ..was was... Revenge. Yes. I wouldn't have killed him. But I couldn't prevent what was going to happen once Michael knew. I didn't try. I enjoyed planning it. The eventual killings... The mutilations... Somehow, far off... they wouldn't happen. What would happen would be that Yukio Li would be frightened. Humiliated... I never thought... Michael would do it. Nor did Graham. Who killed Graham Daniel? Your brother? No. Graham Daniel was Michael's son. My nephew. Your brother carried out the mutilations on Yukio Li's body. A knife in the heart, stabbings in the hands and feet, his tongue cut out. Fathers have killed their sons, sons their fathers. No. Michael wouldn't. Couldn't. Do you read Japanese? Why did you set him up? Yukio Li? Why did you go to such lengths? The cassette with dope in it. The ridiculous story of the notebook. Or did you think nobody would care Or perhaps you wanted to throw suspicion on Sir Wilfred, because of his son's death? Yes. We thought it would confuse. But we knew anyway. You didn't have to underline it. Yukio Li WAS a drug dealer, you didn't need to set him up. I didn't know he was. Chief Inspector? Something's been found. What? What have they found? Well, you did ask me to tell you, sir. A body. Kurt Friedman. Michael Robson. Morse! Where is he? Around the corner, sir. My God! Jane! Jane! Jane? Are you all right? Jane, open the door. Fetch an ambulance. Who is that? THAT is the REAL Yukio Li. What do you mean? The Robsons thought he was dead too. They kidnapped him when he arrived and hid him in the showers. Michael Robson brought a look-alike from Sunderland to take the place of the real Yukio Li while he was bound and gagged and fed on orange juice. All went well, but they didn't know Yukio Li had overpowered the look-alike and taken his place. When it was time to remove the gag, Yukio Li invented a story about the look-alike trying to get away and having to kill him. Michael Robson was probably relieved not to have to do it. He carried out the mutilations with enthusiasm, so maybe we're being charitable. Perhaps Yukio Li did it, taking pleasure in doing what would've been done to him. And then he thought this was too good an opportunity to miss. Perhaps he knew the Drug Squad were on to him. Even if he didn't, it might be quite convenient to be thought dead. So he went around mopping up the witnesses. There was one he didn't know about though. Did for him. She'll manage, I expect. Caught the murderer yet? Which one? There are lots. Lots? Left my pen. It's on the mantelpiece. Dr Robson didn't wield that mallet. She couldn't have done. He was hit him from behind. She couldn't have done that while she was being strangled. Croquet can be a very rough game, played properly, by an expert. Not expert. Crushed like an eggshell. Yes. No, I know, not her. Yukio Li was the expert in martial arts, apparently. Like his father. Except his father didn't use his hands. Came up against an ex-RAF lady warrant officer, though. Met his match. You don't agree with those names, do you? The names on the memorial tablet. You know I don't. Don't you believe in forgiveness? Not entirely. I believe I may be forgiven for what I have done, but I cannot believe those who tortured Reverend Robson should be forgiven. Their evil was beyond forgiveness. It stained all our lives. Even unto the next generation? It was long ago. It was not. It was yesterday. I was a young girl. I was in terror for such a long time. Even unto the next generation. I was made barren by my fear. They took pleasure in what they did to Jane's father. I saw it happen to others. They did it to others. Few of the others lived. It was a joke. He was crucified. Bayonets through his hands and feet to a tree. Because he was a clergyman, perhaps. A joke. He bit his own tongue out because of the pain! Do you think he would approve? Who? I think he would have hated what they had in mind for Yukio Li. I should've tumbled. I saw the scars on the old man's hands. On his palms. I think he hated himself for bearing the scars of Christ's suffering. That's what we do to clergymen sometimes. We insult Christ through them, and they wilt under it. Oh, he was fine for a while, when he came back. He managed quite well for a few years. Jane was born... ..then he just stopped. Nothing. Insulted. Wilting. I had nothing to do with it. I knew something was happening. I had sympathy with Jane. She asked me to look the other way. I did. Yes. You did. Will she...er...? Be back? I should think so. She stopped Dr Robson from being killed. I don't think she was involved in anything except turning a blind eye. You don't have to advertise for a domestic bursar. My dear fellow, is there not something we can do to lessen...? To hush things up? Don't you care about the Official Secrets Act? You're still bound by it. You should never have told Jane about Yukio Li. That nonsense was a long time ago. I won't have it. They were beastly to their prisoners but they were equally beastly to their own soldiers! The Japanese have an alibi for all that, and we gave it to them. Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yes, who will take revenge for that? Policemen do make a mess, don't they? Alex, isn't that your name? Yes. I've been to see your Aunt Jane. She's going to be all right, I think. She told me about your grandfather. It was sad, wasn't it? What happened to him in the war. Yes, it was. How do you feel about it? Grandfather was sad. Are you on your own? It's all right, Daddy's coming. It was embarrassing with Grandfather. He was embarrassing. Everybody looked. I knew him. We took him to a few concerts, your aunt and I. A few. I don't know whether he enjoyed them. He used to cry. I often cry at concerts, don't you? I've never been to a concert. Oh, you must go!
