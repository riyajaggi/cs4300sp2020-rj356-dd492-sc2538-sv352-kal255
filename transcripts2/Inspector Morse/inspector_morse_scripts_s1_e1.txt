 Inspector Morse (1987â€“2000): Season 1, Episode 1 - The Dead of Jericho - full transcript 
 Morse is taken aback by the apparent suicide of Anne Staveley. Morse knew her well as they were members of the same choir and he was quite attracted to her. On the evening of the choir's public performance, Morse stops by her house to collect her but finds her front door open and no one at home. On his way home after the performance he sees several police vehicles outside her house and it appears Anne has hung herself. When her nosy neighbour is also killed, Morse is convinced that Anne was murdered.

 Hey! It's a panda! Tell him we're closed. My soul There is a country far beyond the stars We're closed. - It's only a small job. A little dent on the wing. - Sorry, I can't help you. It's a shame because you've such a good reputation for paint jobs. Are you winding me up? No, but I am about to wind up my window! Rick, it's the law! Ricky, it's the law! Rick! He is my gracious friend And... O, my soul awake!

 Hey, leave it out, mister! Oi, mister! Leave it out! God Thy life Thy cure (Laughter and some applause) Susan l think her name is. Susan has got an amazing voice. Susan has a friendIy voice. - She needs it, doesn't she? - l know. Hello. - l was... l was very late. - l noticed. - Another Saturday morning lie-in? - No, l had to take my car to the garage. That's very sweet of you but l do have to get back. - l'll take you home. - Oh, all right. See you next week. Bye-bye. Oh, thank you very much. Where have you parked? l haven't got the car. That's what l was saying earlier. Oh, l see. l'm sorry. l thought you were offering me a lift. l'm offering to walk you home. l'm going in your direction anyway, so it's no problem. How do you know what my direction is? lt's Jericho. Am l right? - Yes. - You told me. - Did l? - Ages ago. Canal Reach, number... ..9. Golly. l hesitated about the number in case you think l've dwelt on it. Do you know, l don't know your first name. - That's right. - So? - l don't use it. - Don't be silly. lt's my parents who were silly. What do your friends call you? l don't know. Morse. (Searching for notes) You know, it's interesting, because ten years ago, this street, or this area anyway, was not considered fashionable. - And now it's Oxford trendy, you think? - Oh, no, no, no. - l didn't mean... - l know what you meant. Fancy a cup of tea? Thank you. MORSE: No, er...I mean... - l meant this is a very nice area. - Oh, shut up. (Turns TV volume down) MORSE: Anyway, tea wouId be great. You have to say you like my house, though. You mustn't say, ''Ten years ago, this is the furniture people liked.'' You've got to say, ''This is the kind of house l really like.'' And l have to tell you this is the kind of house l really like. Well, that's good. Oh, Ned's here. Ned! Are you here? - Sorry, am l interrupting something? - No, no, not at all. Ned is... - l'm just going. - Don't worry, l've just been walked home. - Ned, this is... - Morse. Hello, Ned. Ned uses the piano. He writes music. - Really? - Not really. Anyway, listen, l should probably get along. - Don't mind me, l'll go upstairs. - No, you don't need to do that. l'll put the kettle on. - What kind of music? - Sorry? What kind of music do you write? - Short music. - Very good music. Anyway, my books are upstairs. There's no milk, by the way. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Come through. He's really talented. Really. Doing a law degree. Or rather not doing one. He's a marveIIous musician. He's a terribIe Iawyer. MORSE: Do you Iet a Iot of peopIe pIay your piano? Every day. It's how I Iive. I teach. MORSE: Oh, right. I don't teach Ned. He's erm... WeII, he's sort of adopted. WeII, he adopted me. There's no milk. Will you have something else? No, no. Really, don't bother. - lt is a nice house. - Thank you. ExactIy as I imagined it. And this is very impressive. l've got one of these beauties. - Have you? l used to work for them. Richards. - Did you? A long time ago. Otherwise, l wouldn't have been able to afford... lt was a present. A going away present. (Thud on floor) Er, l am going to go, l think. But er... WeII, Iisten, I hope perhaps er... we couId do something. Perhaps a film or something. lf you're not too busy. - Let me know. - That would be good. OK. OK. - I'II see you next week, then. MORSE: Yes, I'II Iook forward to that. Bye. (Footsteps ascending stairs) - Sorry, did l frighten him off? - Probably. - Well... - Well, what? l can't stand men his age - the way they are with women, the way they pant over you. What do you mean, pant? He's a very nice man. He's in the choir. He was going to have a cup of tea, that's all. Before you pinched all my milk. l've got a pupil in a minute. l want to get changed. You could get some milk. OK. Money's a small problem. There's some in my purse. I'II get it. Where are you off to, my lad? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's nice. Yeah, that's lovely. That's right. Go on, turn round. Oh, that's beautifuI. Oh, yeah. CHOPlN: Prelude in A Minor (Struggles over notes) l don't know how you can bear it, that noise. - Have some of this. - Thanks. Are you getting anything done? - No. - Are you trying to get anything done? l've written about 40 bars of my piece. l meant your law. - Good, terrific. l'm pleased about the piece. - l want you to hear it. Are you interested? - Yes, I want to hear it. - lt's probably rubbish. Ned, l want to talk to you about money. l know, l must pay you back. l told you about the bank. - lt's ridiculous... - No, no, in fact, l don't want you to pay me. l... Have you taken any money from my purse for some reason? No. I'm onIy asking because if you were short of cash, I couId Iend you some more. I'd rather do that than for you to feeI you had to take it. l said l haven't. Right. Do you want me to give you your keys back? l will... No, l just wondered whether you were especially short of money at the moment. Christ, l can't breathe in my rooms. And now l can't breathe here! lt's all right. Sometimes maybe, l may have picked up things without realising. l don't know if l have. lt's all right. Look, you only have to ask me. Please, just ask me. ..above noise and danger Sweet peace sits crowned With smiles And one Born in a manger - Thank you. - See? Real beer. l'm sorry. l don't know the difference. - ls that why we came here? - Partly. - Cheers. - Cheers, yes. Mmm. Anne, l was wondering if we could go somewhere next week after the performance to celebrate. lf you're not already... No, l'm not doing anything. Although l expect people will want to go somewhere as a group. Yeah, l expect so. lt was just a thought. Yes, of course. We could always go somewhere anyway. Oh, well, good. You know... Oh, well, let's see. Could l run you home later? l've got a car tonight. Come through. l'll get the kettle on. - Sorry it's a mess. - Oh, it looks fine. I imagine your house to be very... Very what? I don't know. Very something. Oh, yes, it is. Extremely something. Are you reaIIy a poIiceman? Yes. l think we should... Do you take sugar? l had you down for... weII, anything other than a poIiceman. l hope it doesn't stand against me. No, why should it? Of course not. ln what sense? l don't know. Do you enjoy it? lt's OK. What about piano teaching? ls that fun? Yes. lt's not fun. lt's OK. lt's fine. lt's OK. You have high hopes. Then one day, you turn round and there you are, a piano teacher. lt's fine. l like my house. l like my pupils. l'm fine. And is there anybody... important at the moment around? l think so, yes. You can't say fairer than that. l'm sorry. No... What? No, no, l thought there must be. Well, this kettle takes an age. Would you just excuse me if l pop upstairs? Point me at the teapot and I'II do the honours. Oh, well, bless you. lt's...well, you can see. Anne, are you aII right? l'm... Yes, l'm fine. l'm just... Look, l'll finish my tea and let you get off to bed. Yes, that's probably it. l'm bushed. You're very thoughtful. l don't mean... l don't mean that in a patronising way. l just feel you're very sensitive. No. l'm very disappointed. l couldn't believe there wouldn't be anyone but... l had fantasised, l suppose. Even after last week and your friend. - But anyway. - lt's not like that. lt's too complicated to explain. lt's all very stupid. lt's a complete mess. l think the point is that it's the wrong... At another time... lt's not you, l really like you. Right. Really. l'll pick you up next week, drive you to the performance. - Really, it's so close... - Nevertheless. Thank you. l'd like that. - Good night. - Good night, Anne. It's me. Can you talk? l must see you. Don't, please don't. Well, just come over. Well, any time, l'm not going anywhere. l don't believe you. l don't know. - Will you call me back? - (Doorbell rings) l'm coming! l have to go. Yes. Right. Yes. (Doorbell) (Front door closes) l used my key. Morning. l've just come to see if the wall at the back's dried out so as l can make good. Right. l'm not disturbing you, am l? l would prefer it, Mr Jackson, if you didn't spy on me - in the evenings. - What's that supposed to mean? You know very well what l'm referring to. Well, l'm sure l don't. - l don't want any unpleasantness. - And l'm telling you, l don't spy on nobody! - Well, anyway, now l've said it. - l think it's a bloody insult! l do. - Mr Jackson... - lt's all right. l'll finish the work. - Unless you want to get somebody else? - No, please, go ahead. HANDEL: Concerto Gross (Switches music off) Anne? (Creaking) Anne? Thy God Thy life Thy cure (Sirens) (Excited chattering) Chief lnspector Morse. (Police radios in background) What's going on? ls she all right? l'm afraid not, sir, no. Sir! We're trying to keep people out of here, sir. There's a hell of a crowd in there. (Babble of police radios) - Who reported this? - Anonymous phone call. - Man or woman? - l'd have to check, sir. Never mind. Have you touched anything out here? No, sir. Are you... Have you spoken to Chief lnspector Bell? Just passing, Sergeant. Poking my nose in. - Shall l say you're here? - Was there a note? No, sir. LEWlS: Funnily enough, the door was open. Morse. Don't mind me. - Shut the door, Lewis. lt's not a party. - Sir. l was just passing. Came to see what all the fuss was about. Lived alone. Piano teacher, apparently. Seen dozens like it. Time of year. Grim. Anyway, how are things at the circus? l'll let you get on with it. She kicked the stool halfway across the room. - What? - She kicked the stool away somehow. Lewis is full of grand theories. - No, l just don't understand... - Come on, let's finish off here, for Christ's sake. - Anyway... - Er, sir, the key. Ah, yes. Good night, sir. BELL: Morse. You know who he is, don't you? LEWlS: I know of him, yes, sir. BELL: Wandering around Jericho, eh? l'd often wondered what he did at night besides the booze. - l've heard he's meant to be a very clever man. - ls he? l've heard he's after the Superintendent's job. l don't like that, Lewis. You know why? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Because somebody else we know is after it. Someone who is pig sick of evenings like this. Eh? (Sniffs) ls there a fish-and-chip shop round here? Not that l know of, sir. Right. MOZART: The Marriage Of Figaro (Porgi, Amor) (Snoring) (Clattering) (Baby crying) - Go away! - Come on. - lt's early. lt's not a takeaway. - l've got money. - Well, you owe me ?1 5. - l've got lots of money. Anyway, l haven't got anything. l haven't. Shit. - l'm cold and l haven't got anything. - l must have something now! - What's up with you? - What's up with you? All right. Wait there. l'll have to go. (Phone rings) (Ring cuts off) MALE VOlCE: There's no point, AIan. She sees right through you. - She'II onIy get suspicious if I suddenIy ring up. - OK, OK. But if she shouId ask you,just say as far as you know, I was with cIients in town. I don't know why you bother. She must know. Knowing is different from having to know. I don't want her to have to cope with it, that's aII. It's nothing for me. But if AdeIe has to take it on, it becomes... - And it's nothing. - Yeah, I've got aII that. ALAN: Then cover for me... FEMALE VOlCE: Excuse me, Mr Richards. I have an urgent caII for you. Hello? Police. l'm sorry to bother you. l was hoping you might help me. - l didn't do it. Honest! - l'm sorry? lt's a joke. ''l didn't do it!'' Joke. l see. Did you by any chance cut that key? Might have done. Don't know. l cut lots of keys. Perhaps if you had a good look at it. lf you're asking whether l've ever cut keys for the woman in Canal Reach, then the answer's yes. Uh-huh. l presume that's what you're here about? lt's a small place, mate. l always say this. Most of life finds its way through a hardware shop. You think about it. l mean... Why should anyone want new keys? And not a bottle of meths. Not a dinner service. There's a story in everything. You'd be amazed. Yeah, l cut that. So, tell me, why would Anne Staveley want a new key cut? Even more interesting, why would she want four keys cut? - Four? - Yeah. There's another story in that. OK. Well, l tell you one person who's had a key off her. l'm all ears. Right. Thank you, Mr Grimes. Mrs Richards! (Phone ringing) Richards Audio Research. CouId you hoId the Iine, pIease? - ls he in? - Y-Yes. Do you want... - No, it's fine. - HeIIo. What brings... l'm afraid he's engaged. Can you call back later? - You're so transparent. Next page. - l haven't... - Anne Staveley's dead! - Are you serious? l want you to tell me the truth. Listen, l heard the phone call this morning, so don't... l want you to tell me the truth. Then l will tell you the truth. (Knocks on door) - Yeah? - Mr Jackson? Don't give much thought to other people's peace around here, do you? Up and down with those radios crackling. They don't give much thought, do they, darling? Did you know Miss Staveley? Well, not in the sense of knowing her, no. l knew her but we didn't have nothing to do with each other. - Do you mind if I sit down? - Suit yourself. No, it's just l understand you might have been doing a few odd jobs for Miss Staveley. l do jobs for everyone around here. l mean, that's what l do. Of course. So you've been working for Miss Staveley recently? Yeah. Yeah, l did her new front door and some bits and bobs. l repainted her back wall. I've just finished it. But l hardly said hello, let alone anything else. l just go in and do the job and come home. l see. And er... Did Miss Staveley give you a key or what? Yes, l had a key. l gave it back, though. Yesterday afternoon, as a matter of fact. - I sIipped it through her Ietter box. - Why? Wasn't she in? Well, l rang the bell but l didn't wait. She's a piano teacher. Did you know that? Whole load of people going in and out of that house. All sorts. Yeah, well, l slipped it through her letter box. - It's aII right, isn't it? - Why do you think she may have killed herself? l don't know. l don't go poking my nose into other people's business. Did she strike you as a happy woman? Well, yes, l think so, yeah. She seemed all right. You know one of your blokes was here yesterday afternoon? What do you mean, one of our blokes? Well, l swear l saw someone go into her house yesterday afternoon. l've seen him round there before. And he was there again last night. - l swear it's the same bloke. - Was this a uniformed officer? No, it was a bloke in a dicky and a bow tie. A senior-looking sort of bloke. - And you're sure of this? - Definite, yeah. He's been round here late at night this bloke. Doing a spot of late-night investigating, l shouldn't wonder. lt's quite the fashion at number 9, that sort of thing. Let's have a look at your face. - (TV blares in background) - Excuse me, sir. You've still got a bit of... - Gone? - Yes, sir. You were expIaining, sir, how you came to be revisiting the scene. l don't know about explaining. l was telling you. Why? Are you... - Do you have any doubt about my... - l do, sir, yes. And are you going to pass on this doubt to Chief lnspector Bell? - l think so, sir. - Are you? l'm also going to tell him l have reason to believe you were in the vicinity of the house on the day Anne Staveley died. And it's not beyond the bounds of possibility you were having an affair with her... - Now, just hang on... - ..who you knew through your choral society. You just hang on a minute, sir. l also think you might have had a key from Miss Staveley, and that you had reason to suspect that she might have come to some harm, hence your sudden appearance at Canal Reach. You might also have been borrowing money from Miss Staveley, again for some reason which l can't... which l'm not too sure about. Lewis, tell me about this key l'm supposed to have. No, no, tell me about this money l've borrowed. No, in fact, tell me, as you've done your homework, everything you know about Anne Staveley. - You're not going to deny... - Lewis. Actually, l think the best thing is for you to follow me back to my place. l've got a bottle of some very good Deserai we'll have to... Though l'd like to get back to Canal Reach tonight. We could always get to an off-licence. Sir, apart from anything else, l think my wife wouldn't be too happy... Fair enough. We'll get to an off-licence, OK? l'll probably have to ask you to lend me some cash. But er... ''Dear Mr Richards, it's about Mrs Staveley who died. l know all about her... ..but does Mrs Richards? l know all about it. l hope you believe me, because if you don't, l'll tell her everything. You are rich and what is ?1 ,000? lf you agree... l'll not bother to write again.'' The spelling is... ''Make sure the police don't know anything. Don't give me anything traceable. Get the money in used notes. Don't try anything funny. Please remember your wife.'' - ShouId I speak to AdeIe? - No. Mrs is spelt M-l-S-S-l-S. - Are you not going in? - ln a minute. - Waiting for me? - No, l'm having a decent cup of coffee. BELL: Oh, l hate this place. l hate inquests. Dreadful coffee and it's like a funeral, you know. What's the good thing about funerals? Nothing. Music? So, what's this about you and the dead woman? l want to try and get the inquest adjourned. You're a bloody idiot at times, Morse. - Why didn't you say you were knocking her off? - Because l wasn't. lt would have saved me a lot of aggravation. l've better things to do than bugger around, looking at diaries and address books. Just keep your mouth shut and let things go through. lt's a good job Lewis has got a bit of nous. lt would look great, wouldn't it? Especially with you after a superintendent's badge. ''Suicide woman carrying copper's child.'' What? Thank you. Could you please give me your name? (Weakly) Harriet Louise Staveley. (Clears throat) Harriet Louise Staveley. What is your relation to the deceased? Mother. I'm the mother. l have to ask you if you've formally identified the body of your daughter, Anne Jacqueline Rosemary Staveley? l have. Yes. l estimate the time of death at somewhere between 7:00 and 9:30am on that morning. Apart from the contusions to the neck already described, the deceased had fractures to the laryngeal cartilages and the cervical vertebrae were dislocated. Otherwise, all principal organs were sound. Weight at death was around 57 kilos. The deceased, who bore the marks of previous childbirth, with both striae gravidarum and linea gravidarum, was again pregnant and l estimate the foetal age as somewhere between eight and ten weeks. CORONER: Thank you, Doctor. Have you any doubt in your mind that this woman met her death by her own hand? My job, sir, is to certify death where it has occurred and to ascertain where possible the physical causes. Yes, and you've ascertained the death was caused by hanging. In your opinion, was the death seIf-infIicted? ln my opinion, l would say it was possible. - Possible. -Thank you. You may stand down. I now caII upon Chief Inspector BeII to give evidence. I have your statement before me, Chief lnspector. Can l ask you if you have any amendments or additions to make to it? Not at present, sir, but the pathologist's information about Miss Staveley's pregnancy does raise certain questions which l can't at the moment provide answers to. l wish to make a formal application for an adjournment until we can complete inquiries. I see. Do you have any objections to my issuing a buriaI notice? - No, sir, we have no objection. - Very weII. This inquest is adjourned until July 3rd when a jury will be present. - Thank you, sir. - All stand. - Have a drink later, Max? - Maybe. Dunno. Mrs Staveley, hello. My name is Morse. l'm a police officer. l was a friend of your daughter. Oh, were you? MRS STAVELEY: And erm... Do you think Anne killed herself? l don't know. l don't know what happened but l don't think she killed herself. But who would want to hurt her? She was such a kind girl. She was a kind girl, but if you knew her, you'd know that. She was always. She was so generous and... Look, not now but sometime, could we talk? - l'll give you my telephone number. - Yes, yes. - Will you call me? - l will call you, yes. - Thank you. MAX: Later. There is one thing l'd like to know that can't wait. And that is, did you know that Anne had been pregnant before? Oh, yes, yes, but that was years ago. She married the father. That was years ago. l mean... That was what ruined her - the baby and then the marriage. And then it spoiled everything. She was 1 8. Right. And what happened to the baby? l mean, do you... What... Where does the child live? Oh, l'm afraid l can't tell you that. The baby was a boy. The baby was adopted. l never even saw him. And then er... You see, she gets pregnant again. She got pregnant again and look what happened. Was that a surprise, Anne pregnant again? Until last night, l had no idea, no. So you couldn't think who the father might be? No, no. But if you were her friend, haven't you got any idea? That's what everyone keeps asking. Oi, dirty oId Jackson's in the phone box. Let's get him. - l want Mr Alan Richards. - You in there! lt's a personal matter. (Bang on door) Just tell him it's a personal thing. Yeah, all right. - Come on, hit him again. - (Bang on door) Mr Richards? Well, we don't know each other as such. But let's just say that l'm a friend of Anne Staveley's. Or should we say was, Mr Richards? (Bang on door) What? Yeah, yeah. l heard you. You...you got my letter. Well, how much, then? Yeah, l can remember. l just want to know how much you're saying? Yeah. Yeah, that will do. You'll be glad you done this, Mr Richards. And so will Mrs Richards. Don't you threaten me, mush. l could make things very black for you. Yeah, well, l could. Just you remember that. Very black. OK. This is what you do. Hl-Fl: MlKE OLDFlELD: Tubular Bells - Yes? - Oh, hello. - ls Ned about? - l'm afraid he isn't, no. Can l help? No, no, it was Ned l was hoping to catch. l'm a relative, uncle. Really? Did l meet you at his birthday? l don't think l did. No, that's right. No, l missed it. Well, anyway, l'm sorry. l'll wait. Do you mind? Oh, really? lt's just...l've got a lecture. Have you come a long way? Quite, yes. Would you rather l waited for him outside? No, no. - No, come in. - Thanks. That's Ned's bedroom through there. And mine is through there. We share this room. lt's not very tidy, is it? Sorry. Don't worry. Does he bring Anne back here much? - Anne? - Anne Staveley. He seems to be mentioning her a lot in his letters. l don't know the name, sorry. We were wondering whether he'd found himself a girlfriend. No, l don't think so. But Ned doesn't bring his friends back. lt's not a big place and we don't... He spends a lot of time out, actually. We both do. But he does have a lot of friends? This is Anne Staveley. Do you recognise her? No. No, l thought it was his mother. This is our first term sharing and, as l said, we're different subjects. Who's the dance fan? ls that you? - No. - (Door opens) Oh, this'll be him. - Ned. - What? Your uncle. l think uncle is a slight exaggeration, but we have met. - Chief Inspector Morse. - Christ. - What? Ned, he said he was your uncle. - Did you kill Anne Staveley? - Get out! - Why didn't you come to the inquest? l had a lot of trouble finding you. Do you go to classes? - Look, l've got to go. - That's fine. You go. No, you go. You stay. l can't work out whether or not you were having an affair with her. My guess - not. But you were stealing from her. No, l was not. Yeah, l've met you before. That's right, at Jericho. Yeah, Anne said you tried it on with her. l didn't kill her. lt was guys like you who couldn't talk without trying to put a hand up her skirt. That's what you said, is it, about me? Everyone used her. She was sick of being used. ''Always someone's punchbag.'' That's what she said. l loved her. She was everything to me. A mother and a... lt wasn't just a tickle away from the wife. l'm not married. - Look, can l... ls there anything l can do? - l wasn't talking about you. - lt was your baby, was it? - What? - She was pregnant. - l don't believe you. That's crap. - l've got to go. - No, it's the truth. - l want you to go now. - l've still got some more questions. l want to know what you did with the money you stole from Anne Staveley's purse. Or was she so much of a mother to you, she gave you the odd ?1 00? l don't have to listen to this. Don't! For God's sake! TV: For instance, garlic... Thank you. l'm sorry, the health centre's closed. Well, the point is, l get a prescription and bring it for you. l didn't ask for this stuff. l'm ill. The guy writes the script, l collect it. l'm ill. He clearly thinks it'll help me get better. - Do you ring every doctor? - When you say you're ill, what is the problem? l have an addiction problem. Not that it's any of your business... l'm sorry, l cannot dispense this prescription. You'll have to come back tomorrow when the health centre's open and l can ring Dr Minereau. Thanks a shit. l mean, really, thanks a complete shit. OK. WeII... Can l have it back? Because l need it back, thanks. - l'm sorry, you'll have to collect it in the morning. - You're a pleasant man, do you know that? You will all, of course, have heard of the sad news of Anne's tragic death. lt so happens that she worked for Mr Richards at one point. And it was at her suggestion we invited him along to talk to us this evening. Anyway, Iadies and gentIemen, on the fascinating subject of how a smaII Banbury engineering company made an internationaI impact on the worId of hi-fi, I am very happy to weIcome a name famiIiar to aII serious music enthusiasts. Mr AIan Richards, managing director of Richards Audio Research. AIan. Thank you. Yes, well, just to repeat Mr Hornsby's remarks about my lateness, for which l apologise, and also to share his sadness at the loss of Anne Staveley. She was a very dear personal friend as well as someone who worked with me. There's not a lot one can say, really. lt's a terrible thing. Except perhaps to take care, all of us, with those we...we care about. Well, Anne indeed suggested l come and talk to you this evening about the company that my brother and l founded some dozen years ago, and with which Anne was closely involved in the early years. Now, l'm not really much of a talker but l am something of an evangelist as far as this thing is concerned. The Richards turntable. Who's there? Good night. Thank you. Oh, you're the singing policeman. Which travels before me? The singing bit or the policing bit? No, l...l saw you at the inquest. Anne's inquest. - And then the chairman pointed you out to me. - l enjoyed your talk. - Thank you. - l've got a Richards deck. - l'm honoured, Chief lnspector. - How did Anne Staveley acquire hers? That was a farewell present. Such a generous firm. l'm surprised she left. - Thank you, Mr Hornsby. - Oh, Mr Richards, can l grab you for a second? (Sirens) lt's Morse. What's the excitement? Incident in Jericho, sir. Man beIieved kiIIed. Whereabouts? Er, CanaI Reach. We're getting the number for you, sir. (Starts motor) (Excited chattering) Just so happened to be in the area? - That's right. - And you knew him, too, did you? Jackson? - No. - No. Well, somebody didn't like him very much. Split open his head. MORSE: l know the feeling. What's the estimated time of death? No, don't tell me. - Between seven and eight this evening. - Don't know yet. Max is up there now. - What makes you think you know? - Just a hunch. - l don't much like your involvement in this. - No. But if you are, if you know something l don't, l want to hear about it. - Fair enough. - So? l'll tell you what l know. A woman apparently commits suicide and no-one knows why. We find out about it from an anonymous phone call. Then we find out that this single woman is pregnant. A fortnight later, a man living opposite gets his head mashed in. lnteresting, eh? More interesting than that, somebody was kind enough to call us about Mr Jackson's demise. - When? What time? - Quarter to ten. Something like that. - Will someone have recorded the exact time? - Look here, Morse... No, it's not the same caller. No, Jackson called about Anne's death. l'm certain of that. l went to the box at the top of the road the night she died. The directory was open on P. There was a strong smell of fish. Jackson's perfume. l tell you what l think, Bell. l think that Jackson saw something on the day Anne Staveley died and somebody else didn't want him to tell us about it. Then I hope it isn't you, Morse. Because you keep turning up like a bad penny. l do, don't l? MAX: HeIIo. What are you doing here? - l've already asked, Max. - Don't mind me. Hello, Lewis. Evening, sir. l'm sorry to hear about your head. How is it? - Sore. - Not as sore as Jackson's. We'd better find this Murdoch before he picks on anyone else. - Do you think? - Morse is very keen to know the time of death. l'll know by morning. - You know now? - No. A guess? Between 9:00 and 9:30. That's a guess. The body is still warm. Fit in with your theories, Morse? - lt buggers them to hell. - Where were you between 9:00 and 9:30? Oh, l have the perfect alibi. The problem is, so does my suspect. We were together. ..che mi manc? di f?? Ah! Se ritrovo l'empio E a me non torna ancor Vo' farne orrendo scempio Gli vo' cavare il cor (Rings doorbell) - Oh, hello, sir. - Morse. l'm sorry to drop by unannounced. You're not ill, are you? - No. - Well, l wanted a word. Oh, yeah, come in. Having a bit of a lie-in, eh? - Can l get you a drink? A coffee? - No, no. - l wouldn't mind if you could have that record... - Oh, yes, sir. Sorry. - (Music stops) - Thanks. - How's the head? - Aching. l'll live. l was sorry about that. Well, erm... Oh, yes, sit down. Well, l've got some good and bad news for you, Morse. We're not going to give you the Super's job. - Right. - You're a clever sod but you don't say the right things to the right people. You never will. lt doesn't bother me but it doesn't do you any good. - You didn't want it anyway, did you? - No. l mean, the point is, you are unorthodox. Look at you. lt's not exactly... Well, anyway, fine. l like that. It doesn't bother me, but... ls that the good or the bad news? We're giving Bell the job. He's not exactIy a brain merchant but he does... Well, you know, l don't have to tell you. He's erm... He fills in the forms, he always says the right thing... Anyway, shut your mouth and listen, Morse. l want you to tell me about the Jericho killings. - You've got shit aII over you at the moment. - l don't know why. Well, quite. l want you to tell me what you know. lf l'm convinced you're not mixed up in it, you can take it over. - That's if I'm convinced. - l don't have to convince you of anything. Get your clothes on and l'll take you for a drink. At Ieast you stop suIking when there's a beer gIass in front of you. How can you think l'm mixed up with a murder? l just want to know what's going on. Which pub? Not that bloody awful hole you go to. Wherever you like, Morse. Just give me five minutes. (Baroque music on radio) Yes, could l speak to Alan Richards, please? Yes, my name's Chief lnspector Morse. Thank you. Hello. No. No, l just wondered if you'd heard about the murder in Jericho last night. - What? - (Sirens) A man was killed. His name was George Jackson. Did you know him? Well, you must know someone in Jericho, Mr Richards. - This man lived opposite Anne Staveley. - (Phone rings) No. No, l'm not accusing you of anything, Mr Richards. That's right. Yes, you do have a pretty good alibi. That's right. Yes, l can vouch for you, Mr Richards. l just wondered... ..what you were doing on June 1 1th. Let me jog your memory. That was the day Anne Staveley died. Well, anything you say to me will be treated with respect, Mr Richards, if it's within the law. l see. What would the lady's name be? (Knock at door) Oh, sorry, sir. l'll... l think l'm going to have to insist on a name, Mr Richards. And an address. Hang on. l'm sorry. Hang on. A pen and a bit of paper. Right, thank you, Mr Richards. Hills as in Dales? Woodstock. 37? Right. Oh, yes, l understand. Do you have any idea why Anne Staveley would want to commit suicide? No, I didn't think you wouId. Of course. Lewis? You wanted to see me, sir. Oh, right, yes. l expect you've heard - your boss is getting promoted? - Yes, sir. Good, eh? Oh, yes, sir. Marvellous. l'm a quite different kettle of fish, Lewis. Richards reckons he spent the afternoon Anne Staveley died under a duvet with a Mrs Jennifer Hills. Go and see her and work out how he could be in Woodstock and Jericho at the same time. - Righto. l'll see you later, sir. - l'm coming with you, Lewis. You're dropping me off at the Radcliffe. They found Ned Murdoch for us. No thanks to you. He has to take an overdose before l can speak to him. Well, come on. l want the fingerprint reports from Jackson's house. l like full reports, Lewis. l like everything written down. - Right. - Right. What about the business of the parking ticket? Have you followed that up? - How do you mean? - The parking ticket. Richards' car was parked in Jericho on the day Anne Staveley died. You didn't tell me. There was a parking ticket on the windscreen. You see, somebody's lying. That's the point. l can't work out who. No, l tell you what's worse. l don't believe anybody. - (Car horn) - Careful, Lewis. - What sort of state is he in? - Not great. There's a possibility he'll lose his sight in one eye. Really? l understood he came in on an overdose. He did, but in the process, he obviously got very disturbed and tried to blind himself. l need to talk to him. ls that all right? You'll have to come back, lnspector. He's going to be in the theatre in ten minutes. - Ten minutes will be enough for now. - You'll have to come back. That's very inconvenient. Nevertheless, come back another time. - Sir? - ln here. - Oh, sorry, sir. - Why? Well, l just... - Anyway, do you want a light on? - No. Do you want cheering up? lt was Richards' car. The fine was paid first thing the next day by A Richards, 21 6 Oxford Avenue, Banbury. And l've typed it all out, sir. Good. That's good. ls that how you spell debited? Yeah. What about the woman in Woodstock? She says he was with her. - AII afternoon? - Yes, sir. Did she look like the kind of woman who'd keep you occupied all afternoon? l don't know. You don't know! Anne Staveley was that kind of woman, Lewis. Call Richards. Make me an appointment to see him in the morning. One thing is certainly true. When Jackson was getting his comeuppance, Murdoch was in the Radcliffe. lf he didn't kill Jackson and Alan Richards didn't kill Jackson, who the hell did? Maybe Superintendent Bell was right. The murder was to do... Superintendent...Christ! Let's go and find a pub. l need to get home, sir. lt's my night with the kids. - Well, you'll just have to be a bit late. - Sorry, sir, another time. Ah, sir, before you go, there's news from the forensic people. They found something when they went back to number 1 0. Two prints that weren't Jackson's. - Chief Inspector Morse. - Morning. Mr Richards is expecting you. PIease go through. - Can I get you a coffee? - No, thank you. No coffee, thanks. - Nice place to work? - Yes, very. - Richards a good boss? - Terrific. You're very loyal. Ah, lnspector Morse, do come in. - Are you sure you won't have coffee? - Positive. This is beautifuI. Why did you lie to me, Richards? l beg your pardon? You said you didn't go to Jericho - the day Anne StaveIey died. - lt's the truth. - So, who did you lend your car to? - My car? Nobody. Oh, the Merc, you mean? That was probably parked outside. While you were with your friend in Woodstock? Er, that's right. Yeah, I don't use the Mercedes. It's too easiIy... l have a little Metro. lt's more... Well, l must say, you're extremely generous. You lend someone an expensive car and you pay their parking fine. Let's stop buggering about. Tell me what really happened on June 1 1th. Right. There's no point, is there, if you know about the parking ticket. OK. l did go to see Anne. Look, the fact of the matter is, some time ago, l had been very close with Anne. l was in love with her, l think. At one stage, l considered leaving my wife. But it didn't happen. And so, inevitabIy, it became rather difficuIt here at the office with Anne, and it seemed best that she Ieave and find something Iess... Of course, I made it financiaIIy... That was some time ago. It seemed that she was fine. We saw each other a number of times. Anyway, she called. She wanted me to look in. She'd had work done on the house. l agreed and that afternoon, l went to Canal Reach. But, in fact, there was no-one in when l got there. Although you did go in? - Oh, sure. - How did you get in? Oh, it was...the door was open. There was nothing new in that. Then what? Well, as l said, there was no-one there. l called her name a number of times but no-one answered. So... So? l left. But you went upstairs, didn't you? Oh, well, l might have gone upstairs just to have a look around, you know, see if she was having a bath or whatever. I...I can't remember. You can't remember! You haven't the foggiest, have you, because you were nowhere near Anne Staveley's that afternoon. Who are you trying to protect? Me. My husband's covering for me, lnspector. Husband? That's right. We sent the secretary home. You see, Alan was lying about the car and the ticket and going to Jericho. My husband's very good at lying. Over the years, he's Iied his way in and out of a whoIe host of beds. For once, he's lying on my behalf. Really? lt was me that went to visit Anne Staveley. lt was me that got the ticket and l paid it. And did you kill Anne Staveley? l didn't have to. She was already dead. CHOPlN: Fantaisie-lmpromptu (Doorbell) Yes, l know, Lewis, it smells like a saloon. l'm just going to open a window. Morning, sir. You're one of those people who has breakfast. Oh, yes, sir. - So, what's the programme today? - l don't know. Right. Morning. Anyway, my car will be ready at lunch time. l can't think in these other cars. - Well, that's good, then, isn't it? - lt's all right. lt's a car. - l've got something for the Jackson file. - Which is? He deposited ?250 in the post office on the afternoon he was killed. - Did he? - ln cash. ls this significant? l thought he did odd jobs. l'll check but l don't think it was money he got for a job. - l don't see why not. - That's because you're in a bad mood. Why don't we assume it was money he got to be paid off? OK. And let's assume that it was Richards that paid him off. Because Jackson had seen something in Jericho on the day Anne Staveley died. The money was for Jackson to keep his mouth shut. The signs were Jackson wasn't going to do that, so Richards bumped him off. l see. And this is despite the fact that his wife says she went to Jericho, not him? Another woman swears he was in her bed and l swear he was giving a lecture - when Jackson was kiIIed. - That's right. l think you're probably right, Lewis. That's the way it ought to have happened but it gets us nowhere. Well, l've been asking myself if someone else could have killed Jackson for Richards, and who. His wife? His brother? You're very sparky this morning. You can't beat a cooked breakfast. And it's also my birthday. Go and see the brother, then. Ask him if he killed Jackson. And take his fingerprints. And the other ones, too, while you're about it. And the wife's. Find out if Jackson's recently been paid for a job. Because if he has, your theory's all to cock. Anne Staveley could have taken that ?1 00 out to pay Jackson for a job. - In fact, that couId be part of the ?250. - No, it isn't. Anne Staveley paid by cheque. l have her cheque stub and his pay-in counterfoil. Yes, all right, Lewis. No need to go mad. Come on, then. We'll celebrate your birthday. Oh, no, thanks, sir. It's a bit earIy for me. Suit yourself. Haydn string quartet The boy's parents are driving down this evening. I've no idea what I'm going to say to them. - Why shouId they expect you to say anything? - I'm his tutor. I had no idea about the drugs. And now this. l gather that the family, his family, are childless. That's the other thing. - Oh, really? - Apparently, yes. There's cystic fibrosis on the mother's side. I don't quite know why but she told me when l telephoned her Edwin was adopted. - l didn't know. - No. l want to send one of my sergeants round later to look through his belongings. Unless you object? Well... lt's just routine. We're not intending to prosecute, despite the fact that he assaulted a police officer. Worse, he assaulted this police officer. Now he's punished himself, so there's no point. Well, that's very... Thank you. Well, in that case, of course we shouldn't object to... What an idiot. lt's been staring me in the face. - l'm sorry. What has? - Who killed Anne Staveley. lt's been staring me in the face. (Glass shatters) (Footsteps running off) The same person was trying to find whatever it was they wanted when they kiIIed Jackson. The problem is, it couldn't have been Tony Richards - he was with me. It certainIy wasn't his brother. I didn't get a good Iook at the man but it wasn't AIan Richards. l know it wasn't. Alan Richards is in London on some conference. Is he now? He shouId have bIoody weII asked. Anyway, he can't be a suspect any longer. Did you get Tony's prints? Oh, yeah. l liked him, actually. l don't think he'd kill anybody. l did like him. He speaks very highly of you, Lewis. What about Adele Richards? ls she in London? No, she's in Banbury still. Very happy to give a statement and her fingerprints. Very repentant. Oh, she also spent the evening Jackson died with Tony, she says. - So that's his alibi. - Convenient. A very close family, aren't they? She still says she went to the house and burnt the letters her husband wrote to Anne Staveley? And that she paid the parking ticket. She did as well. - Did you see the cheque stub? - Yeah. So l was wrong about Richards, then? He didn't kill either of them. Oh, no, he didn't kill Anne Staveley. No, no, Richards didn't kill her. But l tell you who did. Do you want to know? - Are you taking the piss? - No, l'm not. The man who killed Anne Staveley is called Sophocles. Who's he when he's at home? l want you to do a couple of things for me. Then l'll explain everything. l want the name of the other driver when Anne Staveley's husband was killed. Then l want to know what happened to the son she had adopted. Social services will tell you. lf they get stroppy and awkward, get stroppy and awkward back. - Do l know this Sophocles? - Only if you loved your mother, Lewis. Excuse me, sir. You said to let you know about those prints. - Tony Richards and his brother's wife. - Adele Richards? Yeah, that's right. Neither of them match the ones we've got in here. Still, at least we can make one arrest. - Who's that? - This Sophocles chap. Lewis, Sophocles died two and a half thousand years ago. What are you doing? Are you just ragging me or what? - No. - You are, aren't you? Look, OK, l don't know who this bloke is. Am l supposed to? At least l can survive a half hour's work without reaching for a beer glass. That's a good idea, Lewis. We still haven't celebrated your birthday. Come on. And l'll tell you why l'm deadly serious about Sophocles. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. (Racing results on TV) No, actually, it was your birthday set me off. Or partly. But you see... No, first things first. You know all about the Oedipus complex where you want to bed your mum and bury your dad? - l know the gist. - The gist will do fine. Sophocles wrote a play about it, Oedipus The King. Now, Oedipus was this big tyrant, a big man, who found out that the woman he'd married was his mother. And a man he'd killed in an argument at a crossroads was his father. So Jocasta, who was his wife and his mum, when she found out, guess what she did? Kills him? No. She hangs herself. - l see. - lnteresting, eh? - l can't imagine marrying my mother. - Well, Oedipus wasn't too happy about it. - Wasn't she a bit old for him? - She was very attractive. Now, after she's hanged herself, he poked his own eyes out. Any of this sound familiar? Yeah, yeah. Anne Staveley and... - And she had a son who she had adopted. - Right. Guess who l find out today is an adopted son? Edwin Murdoch? Yes. And guess whose birthday falls on the same day Anne Staveley died? Edwin Murdoch? - Ah, that's just coincidence. - Anne Staveley had Sophocles by her bed. She almost certainly at one time had Murdoch in her bed. l know it sounds incredible but maybe that's the point. Why else should an intelligent, attractive woman suddenly decide to do something so terrible? l mean, why else does a talented young man blind himself? Yeah, but what about killing the father? l find out who else was involved in the car crash. Right. - Bloody hell. - Right. Oh, it's impossible. No. The only coincidence really is that Anne Staveley's adopted son should turn up in Oxford. lt's possible they should be attracted to each other. The rest, after they found out, well, that's the product of something else. That's some kind of...bizarre kind of atonement. l know. l know. Bloody hell. So Sophocles did it! Bloody hell. (Classical music playing inside) l'm afraid there's nothing to report yet, sir. There's no point in haggling with social services. Go direct to the Murdoch boy. Yes, sir, l've tried that. But he's being operated on again. They're trying to rescue the... Well, he's got a retina damaged. Anyway, he's... They said l can go back tomorrow, but in the meantime... ln the meantime, we are going to the Richards' office. Make all your appointments early tomorrow. We're all meeting at Canal Reach for lunch. - (Turns music off) - Sorry, sir. Who's we? Everybody. l tell you something else for nothing. lf l'm right, or we were wrong and Anne did commit suicide, there's a note. l want to read it. Oh, good man! Can l help you? Chief lnspector Morse. l'd like to speak to Tony Richards. Mr Richards is at lunch. Can l take a message? - No, l don't think so. When do you expect him? - He may not be back again. He wasn't sure. Yes, that's always a dilemma, isn't it? Coming back after lunch? We'd like to look around. - I think one of the partners wouId prefer... - l haven't got time to muck about. You take Tony's office. l'll ransack Alan's. Mrs Richards? Sorry to bother you. lt's Gill. The police are here without a search warrant. Can you come over here as soon as possibIe? OK, thank you. Bye. There's nothing in there, sir. What have you found? MOZART: Overture to Marriage Of Figaro Listen to this, Lewis. Brilliant. Amazing sound. (Shouts) Where was it? lt was filed under B for Blackmail. l'm serious. So, Jackson was... Jackson was blackmailing him? lt looks like it. Except... Except? l'm not sure but l can't believe Jackson wrote that letter. Why do you say that? Well, l don't know. lt's too... Dear Mr Richards, it's about Mrs Staveley who died. l know all about her but does Mrs Richards? No. Well, we know he wasn't very clever. There wasn't a book in his house. Whoever wrote that wants you to think he's not very clever. But that letter... There's nothing to misunderstand. Despite the spelling, despite the punctuation, it doesn't affect what's being said. lt's as clear as crystal. No, Jackson didn't write that letter. And if he didn't, Lewis, who the hell did write it? l hope you've got a very good explanation for entering these offices without a warrant. l have. l'm just photocopying it. l'll have to keep the original but... this is for your reference. - He knows something, doesn't he? - No, it's a bluff. He's trying to force a confession. All he's got is that blackmail letter. That can be dealt with. - You reckon? ADELE: l hate this place. lt gives me the willies. - As if painting the door would do any good. - Oh, don't go maudlin on us. (Sobs) Right. l've told lies and covered up and been humiliated on your behalf, but, yes, l'll try not to go maudlin. Here he comes. Sorry. Sorry l'm late. Still, nice day, eh? Tony Richards? We haven't met. I'm Morse. l thought you'd let yourselves in. Shall we go in the front room? That's probably best. What do you think, Alan? Sure, yes. Might as weII sit down, eh? (Morse plays piano) Anybody play? l wonder what will happen to these things. Look, there's your lovely turntable gathering dust. Tragic. God, these fingerprint boys make a mess. Anyway, l asked you all to come here today because... l was hoping Sergeant Lewis would be here by now. Anyway, it can't be helped. Yes, yes, er...this was Anne Staveley's house. And in there is where she died. From that beam. She tied... a cord to that hook. I expect it was normaIIy used for hanging up her washing. Shut the door, and you can't even tell she's there. That's what happened to me. l came here on the day she died and l didn't even know she was hanging there. That was while you were here, Mrs Richards. - Yes... (Clears throat) Yes. - Yes. You were going through Anne's things, looking for letters that might incriminate your husband. Yesterday afternoon, l was going through your husband's office looking for letters. You found love letters. l found a blackmail note. (Morse plays piano) What did you do about that blackmail note, Alan? l paid up. - Did you? - Yes, l er...l gave Jackson the money. When? Well, you...you know all this but... OK. On the day he died, l delivered the money. l had to leave it behind a telephone box just down the road. There's no mention of this arrangement in the letter. No, he called me shortly after. l see. Fine. So you paid him the money. How much, by the way? ?250. l told him that was all l was prepared to give. So you paid him the ?250 and later that day, he was murdered. Well...you know it couldn't have been me. l was with you. lt wasn't your brother, was it? - Not even a brother is prepared to go that far. - Oh, l don't know. l can't remember where you were on that night. l was with Adele. Oh, yes, yes, with your brother's wife. - And you can vouch for that, Mrs Richards? - Yes. Yes. Well, l must say l don't believe you. l think you killed George Jackson while your brother was giving his talk to our group. l think you followed Jackson back from the drop and confronted him in his house about what evidence he had about your brother's liaison with Anne Staveley. When Jackson wouldn't play ball, you smashed his head open. - How am I doing? - lt's rubbish and you know it. Your sergeant took my brother's fingerprints and they didn't match with the ones in Jackson's house. - And... - So... So what other evidence have you got? lf l'm prepared to cover up for my husband, why should he worry about being blackmailed? Well, l was hoping that you'd explain that to me. l can't explain it because it didn't happen. Tony didn't kill Jackson. (Doorbell rings) That'll be Sergeant Lewis. Will you excuse me? Thank God you're here. l'm halfway up my own backside. Sorry, sir. l've been chasing up that stuff on the Anne Staveley adoption. - Oh, later... - No, l think you should know this now. Anne Staveley's son was adopted by a family in Wales. l spoke to them on the phone this morning. He's a postman. - Brilliant! - Her husband was killed in a head-on collision. The other driver was a pensioner. Died instantly. l've also checked with Swansea. Edwin Murdoch doesn't even have a driving licence. Sophocles didn't do it. Well, it looks as though l should send everybody home as l'm clearly so far off beam. Well, l hope that means you're going to leave us in peace from now on. l don't think you can afford to be so righteous, Mrs Richards. - Anyway... - Don't let us keep you. Mr Richards, we haven't met. l'm Sergeant Lewis. - Oh, hello. - What did you say? l was just introducing myself to Mr Richards. Just say that again. Just repeat exactly what you just said. We haven't met. l'm Sergeant Lewis. But you have met, Lewis. You've taken this man's fingerprints. No, sir, that's the Mr Richards whose prints l took. Tony Richards. ls this true? l'm...l'm afraid so. So which of you is Alan Richards? Alan, don't, for Christ's sake! lt's too late! Alan! Alan! No! Ned. - lt's Morse. - Yes. l want to try and close the Jericho case this evening. There's a few things l need to know, just for my peace of mind. All right. Did you see Anne - on the day she died? - Yes. Or rather l saw her dead the day she died. l went round to the house in the morning - and she was... - Right. Was there anything... Did you... take anything from the room? Yes, l took money from her purse. lt was money. You're not going to believe this. lt was money she'd taken out the bank for me. l believe you. She thought she was paying for driving Iessons. I can't even remember. Some story I invented to get cash from her. All right, but no letters? You didn't disturb anything else? No, l panicked. l was so desperate for heroin, l couldn't even... l should have phoned the police and saved her the humiliation from hanging there all day. I was so desperate. Were you the father of her child? - l don't think that's possible, lnspector. - Oh. l don't have relationships with women. l see. Right, OK. There's just one more thing. A letter has come into my possession, addressed to a Mr Alan Richards and asking him for money. ln fact, demanding money. l'm assuming that that letter was a sort of practical joke. Am l right in thinking that? Yes. Then you'd better have it back. How did you know l sent it? One of those guesses where you've guessed everything else and been wrong. And you typed the envelope and l checked it with your typewriter. Anyway, it had to be you because... There wasn't anyone else, really. So, just genius. Richards hurt Anne so much. That's why she killed herself. She was tired of being hurt by men. l had no qualms about trying to get money off him. He had plenty. And he was so cruel to Anne. She said once that she waited every day for him to call or arrive. And he didn't bother. l'll let that be an end to it. Burn it. l will. Thanks. l miss Anne. lnspector? l'm still here. Yes, l miss her, too. Did she... ever say anything about me? l know she talked about me at the beginning when l was a bit clumsy about asking her out. But... Did she say anything after that? l'm sorry. Not that l remember. Oh. l just wondered. Oh, sir! Some good news. They found the letter. - What letter? - Anne Staveley's. lt was inside one of Jackson's rods. They're hollow, it seems, the rods. - One letter? - lt just said a letter. l don't know. Why couldn't they have found it first time round? We couldn't find it. Come on, hurry. No need to hold it up like a trophy. We all know what a fishing rod looks like. Who found it? - One of the boys. - l guessed that. Well, l think what happened is that one of the blokes is a bit of a keen fisherman. He was admiring the rods when he found the letter. What are you trying to say, Lewis? Where did this admiration of the rods take place? - ln the chap's garage. - ln the chap's garage. Taking his work home with him, was he? l've spoken to the man. l'm confident it won't happen again. And he could have just thrown the letter away. - ls the rest of Jackson's tackle in the shed? - Absolutely, yeah. Definitely. Well, we'll all stay here till we find out if there are any more letters. Sir. Does it say what you thought it would, sir? lt says that Richards broke her heart. Take a copy of it. Let Richards see it. Forget it. There won't be any others. l think he thought she might have written a letter to somebody else. And he read this and changed his mind. Well, don't just stand there. Get this place tidied up. And this time, leave the rods alone. You're a lucky lad, Dixon. On another day, you'd have ended up with one of them fish hooks up your backside. (Door slams) Amazing. Four of us went in that house on the day she died. First Jackson and then Murdoch and Adele Richards and then me. And l'm the only one that came away empty-handed. Fancy a pint? - l'd like to... - Yes, yes, l know. l'll see you tomorrow.
