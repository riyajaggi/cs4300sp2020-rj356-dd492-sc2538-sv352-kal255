 Here! Over here! Help! Over here! Here! She fell off a cliff but a bush stopped her fall. She's badly bruised and has difficulty breathing. Get me a chest tube. Stat! Our friend was brought here. You'll have to go to the waiting room. Only family allowed. Let me take a look at that. - I'm fine. My friend... - Young man, please sit down. Good morning. This is Michelle Wallace with the morning news.

 At least three Greenhouse students were wounded and more are sick after an unsupervised, reportedly unsafe hike in the mountains of Santa Barbara. The school has been in the news a lot recently, not least of which when two employees and a parent were arrested for criminal activity. We have not been able to reach headmaster Louis Osmond for comment yet. The Greenhouse Academy school for future leaders is long considered one of the country's most prestigious private boarding schools... What happened? You dropped something. What? There's gonna be a little skirmish between a few inmates in a half hour. Use that key to hide in the laundry room. Now. Oh, Soph.

 - Oh, my God, you okay? - I'm okay. Who needs two lungs? When I saw you fall off that cliff... Thank God that shrub was there to block your fall. I guess so. Though I wouldn't mind something less thorny. Yeah, like a beanbag chair. Don't make me laugh. Oh, Sophie. Oh, my God. It's so good to see that you're all right. - Dad, she's not all right. She's... - Hey, hey. I'm fine. Brooke, can I talk to Sophie alone? Now, what were you thinking? Drinking that water? And not calling for help? I don't know. We were trying to win. Oh, as always. - How are you feeling, captain? - Awful. - Sophie, I am so, so sorry. I... - No, no, I'm sorry. I... I can't believe I let this happen. You fell, Sophie. You didn't let this happen. - If anyone's responsible... - It's... It's all my fault. All my fault. I'm their captain. Nobody wanted to lose. You know what the pressure is like in this school. Which is my next question. Why are you wearing Eagles colors? - That's on me, Ms. Woods. - No, it's not. I chose to wear this, Mom. Oh, that's your dad. I need to sign some papers to release Alex. Daniel, you'll look after Hayley for me? - Yes, Ms. Woods. - Thank you. You can call me Ryan. Okay. - Bye, Mom. - Ryan. What're you smiling about? The nurse told me to make sure it doesn't get infected. - Thanks. I... - Oh, seriously, it's no problem. It's the least I can do. You've been through so much. First, Aspen goes back to London, leaving you all alone, and now this. It's tragic. Yeah, well, everyone's been through a lot. Not just me. Well, nothing from today would have happened if Hayley hadn't switched teams and started everyone fighting. You know, now that I think of it, maybe Hayley burned the flag. No, she would never do that. Who else could have done it? It was a routine leadership challenge. They failed, unfortunately. I don't remember going out in the woods alone when I was at the Greenhouse. They weren't alone. We always knew where they were... Louis, if those bushes hadn't stopped Sophie's fall... But they did. Everything's okay now. It's not okay. The other parents are upset, too. Those were our kids out there. They pushed themselves too far. They could have died. Ryan, don't you think that's a little extreme? Louis, there's going to be an investigation into this. The state won't let this thing go untouched. They want answers. And they've asked me to help get them. Is that what this is? The beginning of an interrogation? If you'll excuse me. Thank you for staying with me out there and taking care of me. You should probably call Jackie and tell her how you are. She might be seeing all of this on the news. - Emma, I should tell you that... - I... I should call Leaf, too. Well, it's nice to see you guys, too. What are you doing here? Aren't you an Eagle now? I guess I am. Here to pick up my stuff. Leo, you're our captain. You have to do something. You can't just let her leave. Yeah, Hayley's not an Eagle. She's... one of us. Sophie texted from the hospital. She's already bored. - Not surprised. - Of course. Hey, Eagles. Hey! Oh, what's up, babe? Mmm. Feel free to stay as long as you want. Maybe even forever. Hey, don't let this guy pressure you. That's my job. - Mmm-hmm. - Definitely stay forever. - I love you, bro. - I love you, too. Come on. Let's get a bed set up for you. - Oh, she can have mine. Yeah. - Mr. Osmond, tell me why - the children of the Greenhouse... - What is this? ...were left alone in the wilderness? And the lack of answers continues in this shocking story of teens near death and starvation. "Death and starvation"? Hey, guys. Anybody hungry? Hey! There it is. Seth, thanks, bro. Don't thank me. Louis sent them over. Come on, guys. Hmm, Louis sent them over. Mr. Osmond, can you tell me why the children of the Greenhouse were left alone in the wilderness? And the lack of answers continues in this shocking story of teens near death and starvation. What're you doing here? My guess is the same as you. Whoa. I knew Davies got there way too fast. Your coach was the rat. Whoa, hey, Coach Davies is a good guy. He wouldn't have done this on his own. You think Louis told him to do it? Look, we can't tell anyone about this. Louis could get in really big trouble. Whoa, are you kidding? I can't hide this from Hayley. You know her. She can read people like a book. Yeah, I know. But she can keep a secret, though. No. No, she shouldn't have to. And we think Louis was just trying to divide us. To make us compete again. Hey, my dad may have wanted us to compete, but he never meant for us to fight with each other. He didn't steal our iodine pills. He also didn't cheat or hide the sign. I think the Ravens deserve an apology. Yeah, you first. Make me. You know, you've got real bold lately. Yo, enough, guys. This is not about the Eagles versus the Ravens. It's about the Greenhouse. What're we gonna do tomorrow when they question us about what happened? So, what, you want us to lie? No. Look, we just want everyone's opinions on what to do. If we tell people what Louis did, he could get in trouble. Maybe even fired. Wait, what? Like, you think the school would close down or something? I mean, wouldn't they just find someone to replace him? No one can replace my dad! He is the Greenhouse. She's right. We should cover for him. It's our faults that we got hurt. What? No, it isn't, Alex. Guys, none of this would have happened if they didn't push us to fight each other. Look, guys, I think we should vote. And we should all honor whatever we decide. - All right? - Yeah. So, all those in favor of telling what we know about Louis? And all those in favor of keeping things quiet? All right. Then we've decided. This never happened. Everything that you knew before you walked in here tonight is what you tell them tomorrow. We competed, we fought... and we took it too far. Okay? - All right. - Okay, guys. Hey, uh, you good? Whatever the group wants, right? Administration, teachers and students of Greenhouse Academy are currently under investigation to find out exactly what happened up in the rugged mountains of Santa Barbara. Is it better? Because I feel great. It's just fine. Can I go home today? You're going to need some rest after what you've been through. It's gonna be a few days before you go out. Some critics now question Osmond's judgement. Did Mr. Osmond know about the fighting between the two houses in real time? And if he did, why didn't he stop the fight before things got out of hand? The investigation will be headed by Celina Hayes, the chair of the state's board of education. Ms. Osmond... You can call me Brooke. Brooke. Why was your entire team dehydrated at the end of the hike? We left our iodine pills at the river. It was our fault. We decided to go on without them because we wanted to win the challenge. Why was it so important for you to win at all costs? Especially your health? It's the Greenhouse. We're competitive. You should know that from your wife and kids' experiences here. Speaking of, why did Alex drink the water if you all knew it was impure? He was testing it for me. Because he was protecting me. True love makes even the smartest man a fool. Why didn't you use your walkie-talkie after Max got hurt? Max wanted us to go on without him. He wanted our team to win. We all did. You lost a member of the Ravens to the Eagles. Why do you think that happened? Hayley wanted a change. Um, a fresh start. Fresh start from what, exactly? There was some fighting between the houses. Some of the people on her team thought it was Hayley's fault, but it wasn't. Then whose fault was it? Who burned the flag? We were just messing with them. Uh, we didn't think they'd get so upset. So, you joined the team that had just burnt your own team's flag? Did Daniel say that? Is that what happened? Yes. It was a prank. Really? Really. Nobody meant to get hurt. What if Hayley tells about my dad? She wouldn't break a promise. But she voted against us. I mean, she's not really an Eagle yet, so... No, I know her. She won't rat. Hey, guys. - Hey! - Sophie! Oh, my God, you're back? It's so great to see you. - Hey! Oh. - Hi. - How are you? Okay? - Soph! - Sophie! - Hi. Ooh! - Here, let me take your bag. - Thank you. How you doing, girl? Good to see you. Yeah. Hey, Soph, you feeling better? Yeah. Ugh, I couldn't stay in that... - Sit down. - ...hospital another day. Plus, I heard something about an investigation. What's going on? Ah, it's nothing, really. We actually found out Louis had Coach Davies - mess with us in the woods. - What? Yeah. He's the one who burned the flags and painted Leo's guitar. Seriously? But, I mean... You know, after having to listen to Leo play all night, I'm surprised Coach didn't smash that thing. Wait, why are you all joking about this? What Louis did was awful. Hey, Soph, we were the ones who took it too far. Not my dad. But... but why? Like, why would he do that? We think to make us compete again. - Yeah. - Yeah. Sophie... we all took a vote last night and decided to keep things quiet. You know, for my dad's sake. What do you mean? Well, I did it. I lied to my dad. Like that's not gonna haunt me forever. Hey, Soph. How are you? Wait, so you all lied about what happened? Do you want my father to lose his job over this stupid hike? I told you, we all voted for this. Yeah. Yeah, well... I'm not a liar. And I didn't vote. Sophie! - Is she serious? - She's doing the right thing. Sophie, please. Don't do this. We could all lose a great leader. Maybe even lose this school. It's not our decision to make. What are you saying? Are you trying to take my dad down? It's not like he pushed you off that cliff. What are you talking about? Brooke, I almost died. But it's not just about that. I would never pressure someone to lie about what I did. My dad would never do that. No, he wouldn't. But you just did. Soph, I'm not pressuring you. I am begging you. My dad has had such a hard time lately with Jason and everything. Please. Don't do this. All right. Well, that's it. I'll report, uh, my findings to the state board, of course, but I don't think any inappropriate or criminal activity took place. Do you? No. Thanks. As hard as this was, I'm glad everything was investigated, if it gives the state peace of mind. Absolutely. - Soph. - Sophie. You got released! Actually, I am here to be interrogated. Testify, what... whatever you're calling this. Sophie, you were just in a major accident. You don't have to talk about anything. No. I want to. The thing is, if Louis has taught me anything, it's that a great leader should always speak their mind... keep their word, and... tell the truth. I'm sorry. Thank you, Sophie, for being incredibly brave for the second time. Well... her statement changes everything. I'll have to report this to the state board, of course. Mr. Osmond, I'm sorry, but I must tell you, this probably does not bode well for your cause. I understand. Sophie, what'd you tell them? You... and you. I want to talk to both of you, right now. Soph... You didn't. Is it true? Was Louis really responsible for all of this? Yes, he was. - So, both of you just lied to my face. - No. No, it wasn't like that. We all took a vote... Oh, so you all came in knowing you're going to lie to my face? I thought your mother and I taught you better than that. Yep. I heard the whole thing. - How? - How do you think? My ear to the door. - Man, that girl has got some cojones. - Thank you. I was talking about Sophie. Leo, what will happen to Louis? I don't know if he can come back from this. - Oh, Brooke. Oh. - Daddy. It's going to be okay. I resigned from the Greenhouse. No. Please, no, Dad! It's the right thing to do. And you know who would have agreed with me? She would. She would've said, "Oh, Louis, you've really stepped in it now. Better get some new shoes." What does that even mean? It means I have to move on. - Then I'm coming with you. - Absolutely not. You're staying here. When your mother was dying, she made me promise that you and Jason would grow up and study here, in this place that she so loved. And a wise young friend of yours just reminded me, all great leaders always keep their word. All right? Hey, hey, little sis. I need your help.
