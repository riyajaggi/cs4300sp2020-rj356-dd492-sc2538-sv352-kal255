 Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Maybe it was a deer. - We killed Bambi? - It was Enzo! - We killed Enzo? We're all going to jail. It's all over for us. - Goodbye, Harvard. - Oh, my God. Emma? Guys, it was just a deer. It's not even dead. It just ran away. - No, no, no, no. - But what if he was a she, and ran away to die? We killed Bambi's mom? Not Bambi's mom.

 Oh, my God. Thank you for being alive. Sophie, no! - What the hell are you doing? - Ow! Jesus! You're the one who ran into me! Technically, you ran into us. - We really should call an ambulance. - No! No. No ambulance. Nobody can know about this. Of course not, Enzo. What is it this time? Huh? Look at me! - What? - Is it gambling debt? Whose car is that? I don't think you need to worry about him anymore. What? Whoa! Whoa, whoa, guys, I didn't do nothing. I swear. He was already comatose when I found him.

 Oh, my God. Enzo, you are in really deep this time. Yeah? And you're not? What do you think is gonna happen when the cops come out here, find out you borrowed a school van, and have stolen moon crap in your car? - "Moon crap"? You don't even know what... - Max! Not the time. You... you guys, he's right. - Thank you. - We can't tell anyone about this. We could get kicked out or worse. What do we do? What do we do? Help. All right. Soph, help me wipe his car for fingerprints. Nobody touches the gold plate, okay? Nerd boy, you heard me? We'll leave it in the car. That'll make the boss happy and keep him quiet. Let's go. Let's go! All right, everybody, I want to introduce our newest Raven, Brooke Osmond. Hey, guys, you're here just in time. Say hi to our newest member. - Hey! - What? I know this is a little weird, but just imagine how weird this is for me. - Did I say something wrong? - Nah. I'm sure they're just working out some quantum physics theory in their head and can't be distracted, or... I don't know. Max, I'm starving! Right! Food. Gotta go. Cute couple. Perfect for each other. - We're not dating! - We have significant others! Hmm. They doth protest too much, methinks. Ah, quoting Shakespeare already? You're gonna fit right in. Let's hit the books, guys. - Got it! - Great. I need alcohol and gauze. Watch out. Watch out. Oh, stop. Oh, it looks really deep. I think he needs stitches. Oh, God. I hate the sight of blood or stitches or injuries of any kind. We're gonna have to sew him up. Fine, I'll do it. Give me that. Calm down, calm down. Oh, wow. Wow, that's... Wow. Uh, how about Max and Parker go and take care of the magnetite? Good idea, Emma. We need a new gold base for it anyway. - I'll do that. - Thank you, Em. Where'd you find those two studs? Bring it on, Soph. I can take it. Now... take this. Turn the knob and press this button. We need to heat up the edge of the magnetite so it'll mold to the base. - Okay, you said turn the knob? - Mmm-hmm. Okay. - And, then just... - Perfect. Okay, okay. That's pretty cool. How did you know how to do that? There's a lot of things you don't know about Soph. - Yeah? - Mmm-hmm. There's a lot of things I know about you. So, when the hell are you gonna get out of here before I tell everybody? Can I get some water? Sure. Here, just lift your head. Uh... I'll... just go get some bottled water. Soph... it's just us now, you know. You can tell me the truth. Which is what? You know what I'm talking about. What's wrong with you? Thanks. At least somebody is nice around here. - Seriously? - Mmm-hmm. Hey! Come on. Get away from there. - What are you... - Hey! Hey! Stop. What the hell are you doing? That rock is what killed my guy. - What? - And it almost killed me, too. Yeah. - What are you talking about? - I don't know, okay? I don't know. It's something about the heat. Heating it makes it toxic or whatever. It's... it's the smoke that does it. Does Ryan know about this? If she did, she never would have given it to us. - Well, we have to tell her and NASA. - No! No! We don't need to tell anybody anything. Hey, nerd boy. Put that thing in a refrigerator, lock it up, and we don't talk about this ever again. Got it, Google? - His name is Max. - Whatever. Max. Thanks for the stitches. So, what now? I mean, I guess we do what he said. Listen, there's still a fake magnetite on the wall, right? - Yeah. - All right, fine. We're good. Look, no one has to know what happened. We can all get out of this alive. Maybe we can tell Ryan, and she'll be able to... Tell Ryan what? That she gave you a poisonous rock? You wanna get another headmaster fired? Or do you want him coming after us still? So what, we're just gonna let a psycho keep working here? What else can we do, Sophie? Now, look. The real gold plate covered his debt, right? Okay, so maybe he'll just leave. Or maybe he won't. Max, can you... - Thank you. - Parker, be careful. I got it, I got it. There's a padlock on top of the fridge. You can lock it with that. Okay. - Who's this guy? - Don't know. Never seen him. Well, he seems to know what the magnetite can do, and now those other brats do, too. I don't understand. Is there a third piece of magnetite? No. It's a fake. - See? - Damn it! What are they planning? I have no idea. But we have to get the magnetite out of the Greenhouse ASAP. Hey. - It's a new day, right? - Yeah. Everything's gonna be okay. Parker, what's wrong? So, that's that. She's a Raven now. Unbelievable. Did you talk to her? No. No, my mom told me. I don't know what's worse. Brooke leaving, or Brooke being a Raven. It doesn't make any sense. God, this is all my fault. No, I was... - It's my fault. - No, no, no, guys, listen. All right? We all messed up. We should have been more understanding. Look, let's all just go talk to her, okay? - Yeah, maybe... - No. Guys... my mom specifically said we can't do that. Well, hey. Guess that means I officially get to stay. Yeah, I guess so. Well, don't get too excited. Uh, I'm sorry. It's just... weird. I... I can't picture her in a Ravens uniform. Red and blue look good on you. I think. I don't really know fashion. Maybe you could teach me. Uh, okay. It's so nice to have another cool girl around here to gossip with. Okay, sure. - What is your chess rating? Mine's 2351. - Um... Okay, guys. Uh, why don't we give our new Raven a little time to adjust? Oh, my God, Suzanne's back. Awesome! Annual Capture the Flag challenge. Let's get out there. Sorry, adjustment time is over. We need you today. Well, we did win last year. I mean, they won. We lost. You guys, uh, us. Right. Um, you know what I mean. You're gonna be a great Raven. Let's go! Hey, guys. Needless to say, I am very happy to be here and not staring at a cement wall eating Jell-O. For those of you who don't know the rules of Capture the Flag, each team has to hide their flag above ground. If you're captured on the other side, you have to sit on the penalty bench for five minutes before going back. Wait, wait, wait. So, this isn't just another "win for the sake of winning" challenge, is it? Yes. But I think the joy of winning will be most evident while you're riding on this. All right, okay? Okay. All right, so here are your flags. You have five minutes to strategize. Let's go. - Thank you. - Good luck. All right, guys, we are winning this. All right, so the Ravens are dying to win because of their losing streak. Well, we don't want to end their streak, dude. True! Okay, okay, okay. So, what's our strategy? - Get on that banana boat in an hour. - Uh-huh! In this game, strategy is everything. Obviously, we can't outrun them... So, we have to get into their heads. So, we mess with their heads. - I think I can help you with that. - Right. - They obviously can't outrun us. - Mmm-mmm. We'll start by picking off the slowest ones. Ooh, Max and Emma. - Got it. - There you go. I hate to break it to you, but they're gonna wanna go after you and Max first. Right, because we're such great strategists. Actually, Max and Emma are gonna be the ones guarding the flag - because they can't run. - Mmm-hmm. We should be looking for it wherever they are. Guys, guys, they're not gonna do that. They're not that predictable. I think that we should... Hayley, just trust us, all right? We got this. - Yeah, totally. - We got you. All right, guys. That's enough strategizing. Let's begin! - Hello? - Hello, Enzo. Who the hell is this? I'm the guy who just wired $50,000 into your account. Yeah, right. And I'm the freaking tooth fairy, bro. Hey! Don't hang up on me again. Yeah, uh... Sorry, bro. Yeah, no, it'll never happen again. - Good. That's just an advance. - An advance for what? All right, wait, hold on a second. Who are you? Well, I'm paying you enough so you don't have to ask me that, aren't I? - Yeah. I guess. - Good. Now, I'll pay you ten times that if you make a very small delivery. Do you want in? Eagles and Ravens, come on! - Come on! Let's win this! - Yeah! - We're coming for you. - I'm going forward. All right, come on, guys. Let's spread out. Ready? Did you know this game was invented as a way for European children to send secret messages to the Allies during World War II? - Really? - No. But that would make a really cool story, wouldn't it? Max! What're you waiting for, Woods? You're an Eagle now. You should be able to outrun me. Yeah, well, Cruz, you're a Raven and I can still outsmart you. Boo! - I'm gonna get you. - Oh, my God! I'm gonna get you! Ah! I got one. We got one! How did we do that? Suck it, Eagles! You're going to jail. You'll write a resignation letter and leave it on your desk. Write her that you appreciate the opportunity but that job is just not for you. Get the magnetite. The real one. Put it in a garbage bag and cover your tracks. Leave the Greenhouse and make sure nobody sees you. Now, put the bag in the black bin and leave forever. Once I get the rock, I'll wire you the rest of the money and you're free to do with it whatever you please. But if you talk about this to anyone, it'll be gone. And so will you. You think we can trust this guy? I know his type. We don't need to trust him. We just bought him. Come on, Eagles! Let's go! You said you could handle the weakling. Dude, it was on purpose. Besides, you're the one who got caught by a Raven girl. I'm telling you, Sophie, we need to try a different approach. Trying to outrun them isn't gonna work. What? No, look, don't worry. Look, I know you're new, but this is the Eagles' tried and true strategy, okay? All right, five minutes have gone. You can go now, guys. - Oh, we're good? - Yeah, you're a-go. Come on, Max! Yeah. Come on, Eagles! Nice! Watch the sneakers! They're new. There you go. Let's go, Leo! Good one, Leo. No fair. I was on the Raven side. Becca, I'm sorry. You were caught fair and square. Oh, man. Look at that. You see? I told you. Watch them stack up. Soon we can make our move. Get 'em! Guys, I told you, the Eagles will outrun you! God, this is ridiculous! You regretting that decision already, B? Stay out of it, Parker. Hey! Get her! Get her! Tree! Tree! Tree! Tree! No, no, no, no! Yeah! - And she's been got! - Emma! Here we go! - Eagles! - What am I supposed to do? - Man our side by myself? - Come on, Eagles! Let's go! Come on! This is ridiculous! I should just give up now. I can't believe this! No wonder why you guys lose every year! What? Come on. Get back. Come, come get me! Come on! You look hot. Want me to wipe your forehead for you? What? No, no, no, no! The Ravens have won! Are you kidding me? Yay! Hold on! That's not fair. They must've buried it. We looked everywhere. Mmm... No, you didn't. And you had a whole five minutes to find it, too. God! Damn it! Ravens! Ravens! Ravens! Ravens! If you hadn't distracted me, I would have found the flag. - Me? - Yeah. You're the one analyzing the game like some expert commentator on ESPN. We all know Brooke told 'em our strategy. If we hadn't let her go, this wouldn't have happened. He's right. You guys, we didn't lose because of Brooke. We lost because we were predictable and complacent. Hayley, let's not place blame. Are you kidding me? That's all you guys have been doing. They beat us because they're better than us. Accept that and move on. - No, see here, we don't accept losing. - Yeah. Well, then, Parker, get used to living a really long and unhappy life. Losing is what makes you better. You know what? Who cares? We're the Eagles. We're already the best. Yeah! - I'm being honest... - Right? - Eagles! - Can we take a walk, please? Look, I'm really not in the mood. Really? You'd rather just sit here and wallow in your pity? You know what? You deal with things your way, and I'll deal with them mine. Fine, I will. - Let her go, let her go, D. - Yeah, just... Hello. Well... hello. Thanks for this. Any time.
