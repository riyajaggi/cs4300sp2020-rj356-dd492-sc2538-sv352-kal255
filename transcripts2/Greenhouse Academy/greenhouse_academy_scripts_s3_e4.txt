 Who are you? What? - Hey, Soph. What's up? - Oh, God, I... I think I lost my Louie somewhere outside. All right, let's just go find it. Uh, I can even call it for you. No, no. It's dark outside, - and it could be anywhere now. - Yeah. Damn, Ryan's gonna think I'm such an idiot. No, she won't know that. I... She won't think that. You know what I meant. Uh, I mean, if you want,

 we could look and see if there's any spares in Marcus's office. What happened? Yo, it smells like a combination of mildew and old bologna sandwiches in there. - Really? - Yes! And when are they gonna hire a new groundskeeper, anyway? It's been, like, over a month. Do you have it? Oh, okay. - Thank God. - I got you. This is perfect. Thank you so much, Parker. - You're my hero. - I guess, yeah. I told you not to worry about it. - Yeah. - Ryan's pretty easy. Don't worry. It's just, I love... your coffee.

 Good morning. - Hey, honey. How many pancakes? - Uh... zero. I'm going on a run. Run... errands? Very funny. - Hey, babe. - Hey, babe. Ready for our run? Hey, Daniel. Would you like a pancake? Yes. But could I take a rain check for 45 minutes from now? Wait, what? Forty-five minutes? She's tougher than she knows. See you in a bit. Come on. Okay. Two blueberry pancakes that she's back in ten minutes. Three chocolate chips, she's back in two. Oh, I'll make that wager. Uh-huh. Do I know my daughter, or do I know my daughter? - Carter Woods? - Yes? Chief Diggs told us to contact you. Jason Osmond has escaped from prison. Go call Brooke. She should find out from us before anyone else tells her. Gentlemen, let's talk outside. I missed you last night at the dorm. You know, now that your parents aren't around, I can finally do this. Mmm. Nice outfit. Be ready to carry her back after she collapses in about... - four minutes. - Hilarious. Unless, who knows? Maybe there's been an Eagle in you all along, ready to fly. She'll be fine, bro. You? Not so sure about. There was a riot in the prison. Uh, Jason Osmond, we don't know how he got out, but we believe somebody was waiting for him outside. I can't believe it. - Does my dad know? - I'm sure they've told him. - But you should call him. - I will. Brooke, you know, your brother could be armed or with some bad people. If he tries to make contact, please don't engage him. Tell us, and Carter will handle it, okay? Excuse me, I have to take this. Brooke, we have to tell her. No. You promised. Look, I covered for you because I love you. And you made him leave. I'm sure he's far away from here. What's the use in telling people about it now, when he's not gonna hurt anyone? Because lying about things is exactly what led to your dad having to leave the Greenhouse. If police find out we were hiding Jason, my mom could lose her job. And if you do... You want me to try locating your Louie's signal? I think I know how to do it. If not, there's at least ten Ravens nerds that could help. No, no, it's okay. I... I don't want to bother anyone. No, no, no, it's no... bother. This is the old groundskeeper's office. The one who's in prison? Yeah. That's the one. All right. Look around. After this, we'll check out the cave I was telling you about. All units, the 10-98, subject name Jason Osmond, has been spotted crossing the border at Tijuana. Repeat, 10-98 is now 10-95. Search has been called off. Roger that. Well... Good luck finding him in Mexico. Thanks for your help, sir. - Mom, I have to tell you something. - Alex! I see. Are you sure? Okay. I'll... I'll let them know. Uh, Brooke... Your brother managed to leave the country. What? What does that mean? I... I have no idea how he did this, but, uh, he's gone. Brooke, are you all right? I guess. - Uh, what did you wanna say? - Um... Nothing. I'm just... so glad you're here. Well, that's a relief. Now everything can go back to normal. "Normal"? My brother is a fugitive. I'm sorry, but he did this to himself. - Why are you always defending him? - Because he's my brother. Wouldn't you do the same thing with your sister? Not if she was a criminal. Who are you? Well, hello, Jason. What? Who are you? Me? I'm your new best friend. I like it. Let's do it. Yeah, it'll get their brains working. They need to get back to some normalcy. Absolutely. We all do. Miss Woods! - There's no water... - In the entire Greenhouse. Whose idea was it, moving here? What am I even looking for? I don't know. A pipe... leaking water... about to burst. Really? Isn't that something you saw in a cartoon? I mean, look at us. A NASA genius and an FBI agent beaten by a bunch of pipes. Oh! Oh, I know who you are. You're the client Judy was always talking about. The one who paid her to create the earthquake. I don't understand. How'd you get me out? I told you... I'm your best friend. You want the magnetite. You're gonna create another earthquake. Please. Earthquakes are so last year. I've got better uses for this beauty. Come on, babe, big finish. This physical labor's good for you. This is awful. You can do it, okay? I believe in you. All you gotta do is get started and it gets easy from there. There you go. How do you do that? Oh, my God. No. I'll just lie here. I wanna show you something. I'm here to report a serious incident. There's been an accident. My team ran a series of tests, one of which was checking the magnetite's reaction to heat. When the magnetite was heated past 200 degrees, it began to emit some sort of poisonous gas. What? When I arrived, it was already too late. The entire lab was filled with orange smoke. The scientists were comatose. The veins on their hands turned black. Isn't it just amazing? Those black veins are a by-product of the virus. The virus? It's a virus that's trapped inside the magnetite, and there's no cure for it, obviously, because the rock is from the moon. - What happened to those scientists? - Oh. They're dead. - Oh, no. - Oh, yeah. They were dead within 24 hours. But, hey, thanks to them... I discovered the perfect weapon. What? How're you gonna use it? You mean, how are we going to use it? So, you need to name as many things in that category as possible. I need an Eagle to draw their category. Thank you. "US National Parks." Geography. Good luck with that one. Okay, guys, you have 30 seconds from now. Go. The Grand Canyon. - Yosemite. - Uh, Glacier Park. - Uh, Old Faithful. - Not a park, minus a point. - Wait, no, no. Are you sure? - Ten seconds, guys. Alex, come on. Remember when Mom and Dad took us on that 50-state tour? Come on, think west to east. Um... - Uh... - Uh, Redwood! Joshua Tree. What was that one? That really gorgeous one? - Zion. - Yes! Bryce Canyon. Grand Teton. Uh... Time's up. After the deduction, you have nine points. Yes! Okay, I need a Raven. Thank you. Next up is... "Films directed by Steven Spielberg." Ah. Easy. How'd they get that one? All right, 30 seconds. And go. E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws. God, I love this man so much, I wanna have his babies. Save the nerd-worship for later. - Uh, Jurassic Park. - Gremlins. No, he was just an executive producer on that one. "Just executive producer"? The man is a god. - Minus a point. - The Color Purple. - He produced that one. - Produced and directed. Don't question my Steven Spielberg knowledge. - I wasn't, I was... - Okay, will you two shut up? Okay. Okay, I have one. Uh... What's it called? - Ten seconds... - Uh, no, I have it. It's, um... Do you want a hint? Stop dominating everything, Max. I thought you wanted to win. I can't think like this, guys. Damn! Ready Player... - Time is up. - ...One. I'll give you that. But after the deduction, - you have five points, guys. - Ooh. Eagles in the lead. - That's right. - Hook, Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, three more Indiana Jones films... - Okay, stop. - Max, stop. Please. I don't understand. You're gonna kill people with this virus? Only if they don't pay me. Don't be so morbid. - What if they don't have the funds? - Well... I'm not stupid enough to hold poor people hostage. Where's the sense in that? - Who are they? - They're gonna help us take the magnetite. "Let It Be." "Hey Jude." "Jailhouse Rock." That's Elvis. Seriously, Parker? Uh, "Come Together." - "Something." - Yes. Uh, "Maxwell's Silver Hammer," "I Want You," "Octopus's Garden." Uh, "Oh! Darling." Um, uh, "Here Comes the Sun." Time is up, and that is 14. Very good. Yes! My dad played Abbey Road on a continual loop as a kid, just like any good parent. Like any easy category. So, Eagles are ahead with 85 points. Ravens have 77. - You guys need nine points to win. - Whoo! Yeah! And the last category, guys, is... "One-term US presidents." Ooh. Ooh, that's difficult. - That's too hard. - No, piece of cake. We got this, guys. Okay, guys, you have 30 seconds. Go. George Bush. The old one. John Adams. John Quincy Adams. There's more. Come on, guys. Gerald Ford. I was gonna say that one. Uh, okay, let me think. Uh, Carter. Right. You're good. - Okay. - Herbert Hoover. Ten seconds... Come on! We are better than this. We are better than them. - Right, Leo? - You wish. Thinking, thinking, thinking. Grover Cleveland! Just say Cleveland, we're running out of... Time. That's it. Well, the Ravens have seven points, which means the Eagles have won. Yes! - Yes! - Yeah, boy. That category was way harder than The Beatles' songs. - She's right. - Oh, really? Because I think I remember Taft, Harrison, Johnson and Van Buren. Am I right, guys? Eagles... Eagles, Eagles... Eagles, Eagles. Eagles... Good job, guys. Uh, especially, thanks to your brilliant daughter. - Really? - Mmm-hmm. - Congratulations, Hayley. - Thanks, Mom. Eagles. - See you later. - See you, Ms. Woods. - See you. - Eagles. - Oh, Sophie? - Yeah. Our new groundskeeper found your Louie outside. Did you know it was missing? Oh, I... Uh... - No. No. - You know, we... We weren't allowed to use it during the challenge, so she probably didn't even realize her Louie was missing. Yeah. Tell him thanks for finding it. Well, he's right here. You can thank him yourself. This is Enzo. So, you're Sophie, right? I saw your picture when I opened it. Nice to meet you. Um... Oh, yeah. For sure, yeah. Phew, that was close. He seems pretty cool, right? Yeah. I'm not hungry. I know you're bummed we lost. We all are. I personally think Hayley found a way to cheat somehow. She didn't cheat. Well, regardless of your opinion... Leo... You know I think you're awesome, but you've gotta snap out of this funk. You're our captain, and we need you to be strong, or everyone else is gonna go down with you. You know? Are you mad? Don't be mad, I was just telling you because I thought... Don't you think they'll notice the magnetite's gone? See? It's a fake. Even sounds real. No hollow echo, no nothing. Now, let's get the hell out of this dump. How are you gonna get us out of here without anyone noticing? Oh, don't worry, I thought of everything. Let's just say I created a small... diversion.
