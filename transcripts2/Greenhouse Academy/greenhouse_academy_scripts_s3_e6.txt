 I can't believe he did this to me. I mean, I gave him my life. Your life? Weren't you together, like, two days? Sure, but that was in physical days. Emotionally, I've been with him for more than a year. "My heart is in a different place." Such a... Emma... Max, someone stole the magnetite. How could you? - What? - Is someone blackmailing you again?

 What are you talking about? What? Are you kidding? That... - That's fake. - You're saying that isn't you? I'm saying I didn't do that. - Have you been lying to me all along? - What? Is Leaf even real? No. I mean, yes, Leaf is real. But no to the other stuff. Look, there. When I'm holding the magnetite, the vase is still there. So? So... I knocked over the vase before we hung the magnetite up. Seriously, Max, why would I throw away a piece of moon rock? Keep it for myself, sure, but throw it away? Someone messed with this footage.

 Okay. I believe you. But who could do this? Who would do this? I don't know, but whoever did it has the magnetite. We have to find them. Wait. If anyone else notices the magnetite's gone, they'll tell Ryan. She'll see the footage and think it was you. You're right. What do we do? Got it. I need glue, polyurethane, silicon, black ink and a 3D printer. Man, I'd rather lose by 20 points than one. Really? Because I'd rather win! What the hell happened out there? It's my fault, Coach. I got that sixth foul. And you, you were completely unfocused after the time-out. What happened? So, this is how we greet our new headmaster. What a shame. Hey. Hey. Um, excuse me. Get back here. I'm still your big sister and I can still take you down. Hey, it's not your fault you lost. You all screwed up. I'm actually talking about my cheerleading skills. It's probably what made you miss the shot. Yeah, I wish that was the reason. During the time-out, Brooke broke up with me. What? Except I don't think she was hypnotized this time. I mean, why couldn't she wait until the end of the game, like a normal person? You know, I always thought that she was a little bit... Don't. Okay. Another time, when you're ready to rag on her. Hey, you want to come with me and visit Suzanne tonight and cheer her up at the hospital? I'll call Mom. She'll love it if you come. Wait... Don't call her. You should've seen her face when I missed that shot. Alex, come on. Moms don't care if you lose sometimes. She loves you. And by the way, so do sisters. Oh, my God, it's perfect. I know. When we find the real one, I'm taking this and putting it in my room at home. Thank you so much for helping me. Anything for you. Max, you know how you asked me earlier about Leaf being a lie? Well... I am so sorry I ever thought you would lie to me. Even for a minute. I know you would never do that. Now, come on. Let's finish this and get it upstairs before anyone notices. What's your problem? The magnetite's gone. What the hell? What's the situation with our insider? Stupid kids. How'd you put up with them for so long? Yeah, boss? You get paid? Yeah. - Then why aren't you here right now? - I'm just, uh... camping. Taking a night off. - Am I paying you for a night off? - No. I'll get back tonight. Listen, boss, the kid paid with a solid gold plaque. Better be real. It is. - Be back in an hour. - Got it. Damn it. Come on, babe. It'd help you cheer up by cheering someone else up. Come with me and see Suzanne. Please. Babe, I love the whole cheerleading spirit, but not tonight. Good lord, men and balls. Look, I know you're probably still upset with me... about what happened with your dad, but I'm still your best friend. If you wanna talk. It's not about my dad. I mean, it is, but also... What? Alex and I broke up. What? That jerk. - I swear, I will... - Soph... I broke up with him. Oh. Well, then he's a jerk and he probably deserved it. Come here. Oh, wait, look who walked in. You know what, bro? I'm sick of your emotions getting in the way of everything. Hey, bro, give him a break. - Even KD misses a free throw sometimes. - Nah, D, not when it matters. - Oh, come on, Parker. - What? - There was a lot going... - No. No, he's right. I suck. No, you don't, Alex. It's not his fault. Yeah, all right, defend your brother. But if we're being honest here, he's the reason we lost the game. Well, if we're going to be honest here, let's be honest in whose fault it actually was. Hayley, don't. I'm out of here. While I'm gone, why don't you tell them why Alex missed the shot, Brooke? What's she talking about? Seriously? So, you dumped my man right before his big shot? That's cold. Guys, leave her alone, all right? I missed the shot, it's on me. I can speak for myself. The world doesn't revolve around Eagles games, you know. Yeah, well, it doesn't revolve around you either, Brooke. I mean, seriously, you couldn't wait two minutes to tell him? That wasn't cool, Brooke. You're an athlete. You know what something like that can do to a person. I can't believe this. I mean, do you guys hear yourselves? Instead of asking me what happened, what he did, or how I'm doing, all you care about is some stupid game. Some friends you are. Soph, back me up here. Brooke, you know I always have your back, but your timing was really off on this one. Thanks a lot for your support, bestie. Brooke, wait. Brooke, wait! - Brooke, wait. I wanna talk to you. - I'm done talking. Especially to you. Brooke, please. What was all of that about us being best friends? I should have known better. You've always been in it for yourself. No, that's not fair. I was just being honest. Well, so am I. When I first met you, you knew nothing about the Greenhouse. I taught you everything. - Brooke, I... - You're not my friend. Hey, hey, hey... No, no, no, no, no, it's okay. No. - Hey, there you are. - Ah! I had to ask three different nurses where you were. These are sweet. Thank you so much, Hayley. Of course. So, how are you? I mean, you gave us quite a scare. I know. I promise I'll never blow up again. Uh, by the way, do you want something? They said they were gonna close the cafeteria soon. Oh, no, it's okay. Leo went to get me a latte. Oh... Cruz is here? Yeah, you didn't know? You two must be on the same psychic wavelength, then. Woods. Didn't expect to see you here. Same goes here, Cruz. Thank you. She's never gonna talk to me again, is she? Hey, don't say that, all right? Of course she will. All you did was tell her the truth. You always do. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Eagles, right? Yeah. Eagles! Whoo! I mean, you gotta admit, that guy is way cooler than Marcus. You're right about something. I do always tell the truth. You do. Parker, I have to tell you something. What's up? That guy... He's not cool. And he's not my friend, or yours. He's my ex-boyfriend. So, I have to get a new car. That's going to be fun. Hayley, how's it going with the Eagles? I have to say, it was hard to get used to it at first. Uh... Yeah, yeah, it was a bit weird at first, - but it's great now. - Mmm. Yeah, she's a really talented cheerleader. I never said I was good. Well, what you are good at is challenges. You did fantastic on the last one. Really. Thank you. Pretty easy when you're a big fish in a small pond, full of even smaller minds. Seriously? Well, if they have such, uh, small minds, why didn't you win the challenge single-handedly, brainiac? Well, probably because his mind was on other things. I heard you and Becca are now a couple? Oh, right. How are you two lovebirds doing? Uh, we're not. We actually broke up. Oh! What a shame. I mean, she's such a delight. How could you give her up? Well, a lot of people are in the wrong relationships. At least I can admit when I make a mistake. Hello? Did you do something to my guy? What are you talking about? Don't play dumb with me. He told me he got the gold plate from you and I keep calling and he ain't picking up. Really? Huh. Hey, did he mention anything else besides the gold plate? Just about some stupid camping trip. Are you in on this? Do I need to come up there myself? No. No. I'll take care of it, okay? All right, I'll find him. So, let me get this straight. You let this guy blackmail you into not saying anything? - Parker, you don't know him. - No, Sophie, but I know you. You don't just back down from anybody. Parker, I... No, no, no, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna go talk to Ryan right now and get rid of him. Whatever he threatened you with from your past doesn't matter. That's what you don't understand. Parker, he didn't threaten me. So, what? He threatened you. Me? He said he would hurt you. Why me? He found some photos of us on my Louie. And he just got the wrong idea, I guess, about who we are. I'm gonna make that guy regret the day he ever spoke to me. Parker... That's it! I know who took it! Who took what? Who cares? Life sucks. It was the groundskeeper who took it. Remember how impressed we were when he hung up the magnetite? We were talking about how much money it was worth. I don't think we should stereotype. Maybe he's independently wealthy and doing this job for fun. Although he would have access to the security cameras with that job. - Bring your laptop. - Emma... - Bring your laptop! - Where are you going? Emma! Emma, no, don't confront him. He seems dangerous. I thought you were against stereotyping. Do that... Whoa. What are you two doing here? Uh, nothing. We were just looking for a wrench. Enzo is, like, a friend. Uh, Emma, I don't think you should be friends with Enzo. Why not? Why shouldn't she be friends with him? Do you know something? No. Why? Do you know something? No. We know nothing. Mmm-mmm. Okay, tell us what you know. - Now! - Okay! All right. He stole something from the Ravens. Stole what? One of your silly robots? Uh, how about a piece of moon rock worth thousands and thousands of dollars? Yep. Sounds like Enzo. What do you mean? Hey. I'm sorry, Ryan. I can't take it anymore. Even... Even sitting here with you is hard. I get it. I mean, this used to be your home, and now I live here. I know how hard that must be. I just... don't fit in here anymore. Yeah, well, if you go somewhere else, you're gonna be a complete stranger to everyone. At least I'll have a clean break and a fresh start. I need to leave all of this stuff behind me. What if we gave you a fresh start right here? How? Well, I happen to know a clubhouse that could really use a sharp mind and a strong voice right now. Wait, what? We saw him not that long ago. So, if he's run off, he can't have gotten that far. I mean, don't you geniuses have some kind of GPS that'll track scumbags? - Parker. - What? - Of course! - Right! - That's it! Thanks. - What? We know the magnetite emits a sort of magnetic field, which would... Which would interfere with the GPS signal. If we can program navigational software that will pinpoint the exact location of low or no signal, then... We can find out where the magnetite is! Took the words right out of my mouth. - Make sure you add the... - Coordinates, yep. - And don't forget the... - Triangulation algorithm. Of course. Wow, you guys are pretty amazing together. No wonder you're dating. - What? - We're not dating. God, I hope we find him. I am going to wring his... There. He's in those woods near school. Let's go there now. He's a few miles away. We'll never catch him. You guys in the mood to go for a ride in the official Greenhouse van? - Oh, we can't do that. - Right. That's stealing. Uh, no. It's borrowing for a really, really good cause. Okay. But I'm not driving. Hell no, you're not. Let's go. Come on. I'm just so glad to be back. Me, too. - Boom! Okay... - Oh, he got you. - Ooh! - Well played. Well played. Hey, you okay? Yeah. I am now. What the hell? Sneaky bastard. - Sophie. - Yeah? With all due respect, you're kind of a reckless driver. Max, with all due respect, do you even know how to drive? - No. - Then shut up! Ah! It stopped. - What stopped? - The magnetite. Wait, so we're close? What should I do? Stop! I think she got it. We did it! - Awesome. - That is what I'm talking about. Now, let's get the hell out of here... before we get caught. Max, you are bad. Okay, let's go, guys.
