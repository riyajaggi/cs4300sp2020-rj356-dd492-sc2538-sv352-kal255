  I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE  TROUBLE IN THE TERRON CAMP. I'D SAY THAT WAS UNDERSTATING THE CASE. THE TERRON WORLD IS  GOING TO CHANGE...VIOLENTLY. THE FATES HAVE CHOSEN  THEIR FUTURE. IT'S TIME FOR IT  TO COME TO PASS. DO THEY EVEN HAVE A FUTURE? THEY HAVE A LEGACY,  WHICH I SUPPOSE IS ALL ANY OF US HAVE REALLY. WHAT IS THE TERRON LEGACY? WELL, THAT THEY WERE HERE,

 THEY BROUGHT NOTHING  WITH THEM WHEN THEY CAME, AND THEY TAKE NOTHING  WITH THEM WHEN THEY LEAVE. NOT MUCH. ANOTHER WORLD IS ABOUT TO CHANGE  TONIGHT, RATHER VIOLENTLY. EIRON! [ GROANING ] TAKE A LOOK. [ CHUCKLING ] -I ASK A QUESTION?  -YOU WILL ANYWAY. WHEN WE GET TO MY HOMELAND,  WILL YOU BE ABLE TO STAY LONG? -WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  -IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE USED TO. A MAN WITH YOUR TALENTS  AND WISDOM WOULD BE A WELCOME GIFT IN ANY COMMUNITY. WELL, THAT DEPENDS,  DOESN'T IT?

 ON WHAT? ON HOW CIVILIZED IT IS. -YOU ALL RIGHT?  -YEAH, YEAH. DAR, LOOK AT THIS. WE'RE HERE. WE MADE IT.  WE FOUND IT. -WHAT IS IT?  -HUACA, SMOKING MIRRORS, JADE, WE'RE HERE,  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD. -AND THIS TELLS YOU THAT?  -THAT AND MORE. HUACA, WHAT IS THAT? A SUPERNATURAL. THEY'RE  THROUGHOUT THE MOUNTAINS. AND MOST OF THEM PROBABLY  KNOW THAT I'M HERE RIGHT NOW. THESE BLACK STONES? YEAH, THE OBSIDIAN. THEY SAY THAT HOLY MEN CAN SEE THE PRESENT AND THE  FUTURE THROUGH THEM. I DON'T BELIEVE IT, BUT COME ON, WE'RE GOING  TO FIND THE OLD MOUNTAIN. THIS IS WHERE I GREW UP, DAR. COME ON, LET'S GO. COME ON, DAR...LET'S GO. [ CHANTING ] IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... THERE IT IS. WHERE THE EARTH TOUCHES THE SKY. OUR PEOPLE CALL IT XINCA. XINCA, WHAT DOES  THAT MEAN? IT'S THE PLACE WHERE ROADS CROSS  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD. SOUNDS CIVILIZED. YES, IT IS. YOU SEE...ACCORDING TO LEGEND  AND THE MOUNTAIN'S PEOPLE THE HUACA  HAVE BEEN HERE FOREVER. HOW CAN ANYTHING  BE FOREVER? THEY'RE NOT REALLY REAL. WHAT ARE THEY? -IDEAS?  -YES. IDEAS COULD BE FOREVER. THINK ABOUT IT --  YOU AND I WILL PASS ON, BUT OUR IDEAS ARE ETERNAL. THEY COULD BE BORROWED  BY OTHER PEOPLE, OR THEY COULD SIMPLY  EXIST ON THEIR OWN. YOU SAID THE HOLY MEN  CAN SEE THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE  THROUGH THE BLACK STONES. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT,  BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT -- WHY DO YOU ASK? I THINK WE'RE  BEING WATCHED RIGHT NOW. ARE THESE HOLY MEN GOOD OR BAD? EXCELLENT QUESTION. THEY COME IN MANY COLOURS. SOME OF THEM KIND AND CARING. OTHERS, THIEVES, EVEN KILLERS. YOU SEE, IT'S LIKE ANYONE WITH POWER -- SOME USE IT  FOR GOOD, OTHERS ABUSE IT. SO YOU THINK SOME HOLY MEN  ARE WATCHING US NOW? SOMEONE IS. I CAN'T SEE ANYONE. I DON'T THINK  THEY WANT US TO. THIS IS WHY I ASKED YOU  THAT QUESTION BEFORE. WHICH ONE? COULD YOU STAY  IN A CIVILIZED PLACE. WHAT ABOUT IT? YOU'RE STILL LIVING  IN THE JUNGLE. WHEN SOMETHING LOOKS  AT YOU IN THE JUNGLE, IT USUALLY WANTS TO TURN YOU INTO ITS NEXT MEAL, HEH, HEH. IN A CIVILIZATION,  THINGS ARE DIFFERENT. THEY'RE NOT NEARLY  AS DANGEROUS OR AS PREDATORY. YOU CAN RELAX HERE. PEOPLE DO WATCH EACH OTHER,  BUT IT'S FOR A TOTALLY DIFFERENT REASON. I'LL TRY TO REMEMBER THAT. GOOD, GOOD. LET'S GO TO XINCA. I WANT TO SHOW YOU MY HOME. OH, OH, DAR, ONE MORE THING. -WHAT?  -UM...I DON'T THINK CIVILIZATION'S READY FOR, UH... I DON'T THINK HE'S READY  FOR CIVILIZATION EITHER. GOOD. SEE WHAT I MEAN?  IT'S A CROSSROADS HERE. THE, THE MYDLANDS,  THE TERRITORIES, THE DOWNS. HEY, DAR, THIS WAY,  COME THIS WAY. YES, THEY TOLD ME  THAT I COULD-- OH, DAR, HAVE YOU NOTICED-- HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT  EVERYONE HERE IS PEACEFUL? THERE'S NO FIGHTING  OR CARRYING ON. WHOA. OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT? I CAN'T SEE ITS BEAUTY  THROUGH THE BARS. THIS CIVILIZATION'S DIFFERENT. GOOD SIR, I'M PREPARED  TO TRADE YOU SOME VALUABLE HERBS  FOR THIS SONGBIRD. THIS SONGBIRD  SHOULD SERVE YOU WELL. THAT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. THANK YOU. FOR SHOWING ME THAT ANIMALS  SHOULDN'T LIVE IN CAGES. YOU MAKE ME PROUD. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THIS. OH, IT'S A... IT REPRESENTS MY PEOPLE,  THE EIRONS. BY THE WAY, I HAVEN'T SEEN  ANYONE WEARING AN EIRON RING. HE WEARS A GREEN  STONE RING ON HIS HAND. AN EIRON. THEY ARE LIKE LOCUSTS,  A PLAGUE WHEREVER THEY APPEAR. AND WHERE THERE IS ONE,  THERE WILL BE MORE. BROTHERS, GET SOME HELP! WHAT DO THE SYMBOLS MEAN? WELL, THEY SYMBOLIZE A SOCIETY WHICH IS OPEN TO FRESH THOUGHTS AND NEW IDEAS. -AS XINCA ALWAYS WAS.  -WAS? IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE  DON'T RESPECT THE HUACA IN THE WAY THEY USED TO. THESE USED TO BE  BETTER LOOKED AFTER. AND FRESH FLOWERS  PLACED IN FRONT OF THEM. MAYBE THE EIRONS HAVE NEW GODS. SOMETHING'S  CHANGED OR WRONG. I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT  WHAT IT IS. EIRON! AND HE WEARS  A GREEN STONE ON HIS HAND. I'M AN EIRON. WHO ARE YOU? SEIZE HIM! YOU CALL THIS CIVILIZED? -DO YOU REMEMBER ME?  -TAO'S FRIEND FROM  THE BURNING FOREST. WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE? MALOC AND THE PRIESTS  TAKE ANYONE WEARING JADE RINGS --  THEY NEVER RETURN. TAO SAID THIS WAS  A CIVILIZED PLACE. IT WAS ONCE,  NO MORE, I'M AFRAID. COME QUICKLY! LEAVE. IF THEY CATCH YOU,  THEY'LL KILL YOU. -WHAT ABOUT YOU?  -I'M SAFE IF THEY DON'T SEE ME WITH YOU --  THEY DON'T KNOW I'M AN EIRON. PLEASE HURRY -- I'LL TRY TO FIND -WHERE THEY'VE TAKEN TAO.  -I'LL COME BACK. HOW WILL YOU? [ CAWING ] I HAVE FRIENDS WHO WILL HELP ME. THERE'S A TUNNEL, A SECRET  ENTRANCE BY THE FRONT GATES, NEAR THE WELL,  LEADING INTO THE CITY. I'LL FIND IT. I WILL COME BACK. UGH, OHHH! WELCOME? YOU CERTAINLY HAVE  A BIZARRE WAY OF SHOWING IT. WE PLANNED A CELEBRATION, IT'S TOMORROW. WHAT ARE YOU CALLED? TAO. WHO ARE YOU? MALOC. WHAT ARE YOU? YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. I DO. DO WE UNDERSTAND? WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? AND WHY  HAVE YOU COME BACK TO XINCA? I WAS SENT OUT  TO THE REST OF THE WORLD AS AN EMISSARY,  AN APOSTLE IF YOU WILL. WHO SENT YOU AND WHY? MY ELDERS...IN ORDER  THAT I MAY LEARN AND SPREAD THE THOUGHTS  AND PHILOSOPHIES OF THE EIRONS THROUGHOUT  THE HINTERLANDS. [ GROANING ] YOU MUST HAVE BEEN  IN THE HINTERLAND. BECAUSE THINGS  HAVE CHANGED IN XINCA NOW. YOU SEE, WE'VE CLEANSED  OURSELVES OF YOUR KIND OF DIRT -- YOUR  PREACHINGS, YOUR SCIENCE, YOUR INTELLECTUAL FILTH. WHAT DO YOU  MEAN "CLEANSED"? ARE THERE OTHER EIRONS WITH YOU? WHO WAS THE MAN DEFENDING YOU? WE'LL FIND THEM.  THEY CANNOT ESCAPE. WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY PEOPLE? WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM IS  WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU. THANK YOU, SHARAK. [ SQUEAKING ] AND THE TWO OF YOU  CAN FIND IT EASIER THAN I CAN. I UNDERSTAND THE CHANGES  TAKING PLACE IN XINCA, THE MARCH OF HISTORY. -PROGRESS, I SUPPOSE.  -MORE LIKE PROGRESS  IN REVERSE. WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO  WITH ZAD AND TERRONS? HEAPS, TONS, LOTS AND LOTS, MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME,  PROBABLY LESS. YOU ALWAYS TEASE ME --  I DON'T KNOW WHY I BOTHER  ASKING YOU ANYTHING. NEITHER DO I. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? READING THE STICKS. THE I CHING. SURPRISINGLY ACCURATE... IF YOU BELIEVE IN HOCUS-POCUS. YOU HAVE A RATHER  CRITICAL PART TO PLAY TONIGHT. I TRUST YOU'RE UP TO THE TASK. ONCE IT'S DONE, TEASING WON'T BE NECESSARY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I HAVE A VISIT TO PAY  AND EONS TO GO BEFORE I SLEEP. I SUGGEST YOU USE THAT THING-A-MA-JIG. THIS LITTLE PATCH OF THE WORLD  IS ABOUT TO CHANGE. YOURS AS WELL. [ LAUGHING ] SO, YOU THINK YOU CAN SATISFY A KING, HUH? JUST THE TWO OF YOU?  ARE YOU SURE? I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO PLAY AND ORGY FROM ONE NIGHT AWAY INTO THE NEXT. FIRST YOU... THEN HER... THEN YOU. THEN HER. DON'T BE SHY.  THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM. PLENTY OF ROOM, PLENTY OF TIME. OH, AND OF COURSE,  THERE'S PLENTY OF ME. DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT. I'VE PLENTY AS WELL... TIME THAT IS. ANCIENT ONE.  DO YOU WANT TO JOIN US? DO WIZARDS LIKE YOURSELF PARTAKE OF SUCH PLEASURES. OH, IN WAYS YOU CAN'T IMAGINE. BUT I'VE JUST DROPPED IN  TO SAY A QUICK GOODBYE. GOODBYE? WHY? ARE YOU LEAVING? NOT ME, PRECISELY, NO. ANCIENT ONE,  A MOMENT BEFORE YOU GO. I WAS WONDERING IF YOU MIGHT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THESE SHIPS MY MEN HAVE SEEN  IN THE OCEAN...OFF MY COAST. ISN'T THAT WHERE SHIPS  ARE NORMALLY SEEN? YES, OF COURSE. I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF A WAY I'D LIKE TO KILL THEIR SAILORS  AND KEEP THE SHIPS FOR MYSELF. MURDEROUS TO THE LAST. IT'S NICE TO KNOW  THAT SOME PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD NEVER CHANGE. ENJOY YOURSELF, ZAD --  I WOULD... IF I WERE YOU, HA, HA, HA... NOW WHERE WERE WE? [ LAUGHING ] GOOD WORK. NOW I HAVE ANOTHER JOB FOR YOU. YOU STAY WITH ME, JUST IN CASE. YOU'RE LUCKY, EIRON. TOMORROW YOU WILL ONLY DIE. I COULD TORTURE YOU. MY PRIESTS CAN PEEL  A MAN'S SKIN COMPLETELY AWAY AND KEEP HIM SCREAMING  IN PAIN FOR 20 SUNS. WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT  TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING? EIRONS LIKE YOURSELF  ARE NOT HUMAN BEINGS. WHEN THE SUN REACHES THE MIDDLE OF THE SKY, YOU DIE. THE ONE WHO HELPED  THE PRISONER IS BACK. HE CAME THROUGH THE TUNNEL  THE EIRONS USED TO USE. HE'LL COME THIS WAY. GET SOME MEN AND WAIT AT THE TOP OF THE MAZE. THIS TIME... KILL HIM! TAO, TAO. CARO. ARE YOU  ALL RIGHT? NOT REALLY -- THERE'S A PRIEST HERE WHO WANTS TO KILL ME. -MALOC.  -I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHY. XINCA ISN'T THE PLACE -YOU REMEMBER ANY MORE.  -EVIDENTLY NOT. WHO IS THIS MALOC? HE'S THE LEADER  OF THE BROTHERHOOD. THEY CALL THEMSELVES PRIESTS, BUT THEY'RE REALLY  KILLERS AND THIEVES. AND THEY RULE XINCA NOW. HAVEN'T GOTTEN ME IS BECAUSE  I DON'T WEAR MY JADE RING. I WISH I'D KNOWN. MY BAD LUCK, I GUESS. WHAT ABOUT OUR PEOPLE? MOST OF THEM ARE DEAD. SACRIFICED BY MALOC  AND HIS PRIESTS. SOME MANAGED TO ESCAPE.  THEY WENT INTO THE MOUNTAINS. BUT YOU STAYED. TO BEAR WITNESS  TO WHAT'S HAPPENING. TO KEEP OUR PEOPLE INFORMED. ANY NEWS ABOUT MY FAMILY? I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM. SO MUCH HAS CHANGED HERE NOW. WHAT ABOUT DAR? YES, I MANAGED  TO HELP HIM ESCAPE -WHEN THEY CAUGHT YOU.  -WHERE IS HE? HE'S COMING BACK TONIGHT.  WE'LL GET YOU OUT OF HERE. MALOC INTENDS TO KILL ME  TOMORROW AT MIDDAY. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET  THAT HAPPEN, I PROMISE. KEEP YOUR EYES AND EARS OPEN. THE BEASTMASTER  AND I WILL BE BACK. PODO. IT'S TAO, YOU'RE FRIEND. WELL, SOMETIMES. LOOK, GO AND FIND DAR. BUT WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. BETTER YET, FIND HIM  AND BRING HIM BACK HERE, GO. DON'T MESS THIS UP, PLEASE. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. IF THEY SAW ME,  YOU WOULD GET INTO TROUBLE. DAR? HOW DID YOU FIND THIS PLACE? I HAD A LITTLE HELP. MY EXTRA SET OF EYES AND EARS. I FOUND TAO. MALOC'S GOT HIM  IN THE PRIESTS' QUARTERS. THEY'RE GOING TO  SACRIFICE HIM TOMORROW. THEY'RE GOING TO SACRIFICE HIM? THAT'S WHAT THEY DO... TO MOST OF THE EIRONS. THEN SACRIFICE HIS BLOOD  TO THE GODS OF THE MOUNTAINS. SHOW ME WHERE THE PRIESTS SLEEP. YES, BUT WHY? I'D LIKE TO PAY THEM  A PRE-SACRIFICIAL VISIT. NOT NOW, LATER. WHEN THERE'S NOT TOO MANY  PEOPLE AROUND. HA. ARINA, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. HJALMAR, HAS EVERYONE  SAFELY ARRIVED? AS PLANNED. AND THESE WARRIORS THEY CALL TERRONS. THEY'RE NOT WARRIORS. THEY BARELY DESERVE  TO BE CALLED PEOPLE. I HOPE YOU JUDGE THEM FAIRLY. BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY THE  TERRONS WILL NOT BE MISSED IN THIS WORLD. LET'S GO. I THINK THE BIG SECRET  YOU'RE KEEPING FROM ME WILL SOON BE REVEALED. IT'S A GOOD TIME  FOR REVELATIONS. THUNDER AND LIGHTNING  WOULD HELP, BUT WHY GILD THE LILY? IN THIS CASE, WHAT IS THE LILY? THE MARCH OF HISTORY. -WHOSE?  -SOMEONE WHO SHALL SURVIVE; PROBABLY SHOULDN'T -- OH, AND... YOU HAVE A PART TO PLAY. ME, WHY? FATE IS FICKLE THAT WAY. SO GOOD LUCK,  PUT ON A LOVELY SHOW, AND AS THEY SAY, BREAK A LEG. WHAT? BREAK A LEG?  WHO SAYS THAT? MOVE! MOVE! GET YOUR BACK INTO IT. COME ON, MEN. MOVE IT. DON'T STAND THERE.  BRING THAT MATERIAL IN. WHEN THEY'RE DESTROYED,  CALL MY NAME. [ YELLING ] KING ZAD! KING ZAD! HOW DARE YOU COME IN  HERE WITHOUT-- YOUR HIGHNESS-- OW! IT'S NOT HIS FAULT, KING ZAD. HE JUST CAME TO TELL YOU  YOU'RE BEING ATTACKED. [ YELLING ] OUT! AND DON'T LOOK BACK. WHO ARE YOU? I'M CALLED ARINA. WHAT ARE YOU? A SURVIVOR...OF A TERRON ATTACK THAT KILLED MY PEOPLE...  AND MY MOTHER. OH...KILLED YOUR MOTHER? REALLY? WHAT IS THIS? SORCERY? NO, KID ZAD,  YOUR WEAPONS ARE USELESS. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE. LIVING IN THE PAST, LIKE YOU. VODEN! VODEN, VODEN! BRING IN THE KING. VODEN, VODEN! VODEN, VODEN, VODEN, VODEN! VODEN, VODEN, VODEN, VODEN! VODEN, VODEN! VODEN... NOW WHAT? YOU KILLED YOUR FATHER  WHEN YOU WERE A BOY. YOU KILLED YOUR MOTHER  WHEN SHE FOUND OUT. YOU KILLED YOUR WIFE  BECAUSE SHE BORED YOU. YOU KILL YOUR OWN MEN  BECAUSE YOU ENJOY IT. YOU SEE? I KNOW YOU. I KNOW EVERYTHING CONCERNING  THOSE I'M ABOUT TO CRUSH. BUT I CARE LITTLE  FOR YOU...OR YOUR TERRONS. I WILL ASK YOU ONCE. WHERE IS THE MAN  THEY CALL THE BEASTMASTER? THE BEASTMASTER? WHERE? I...SURELY CANNOT TELL YOU. HE LIVES IN THE FOREST,  WITH THE ANIMALS. WHICH FOREST? WHERE? YOU MAD CHILD. YOU LEAD AN ARMY  TO SLAUGHTER MY MEN IN ORDER TO FIND A MAN  WHO TALKS TO BEASTS? HUH? [ LAUGHING ] PLEASE, DELIVER ME FROM THIS WORLD, BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW  WHAT IT IS ANY MORE. THE BEASTMASTER. TELL ME WHERE HE IS BY SUNRISE OR YOU DIE. WHEN THE SUN SETS,  CLEANSE THIS PLACE. [ CHEERING ] I'LL GIVE YOU MORE SHINY STONES THAN YOU CAN CARRY  AWAY IN YOUR BOATS. SLAVE GIRLS. BEAUTIFUL SLAVE GIRLS. ARE YOU BOTH DEAF? CAN YOU NOT HEAR ME? NO, THEY CAN'T. SORCERESS. YOU'VE COME TO SAVE ME. PLEASE TELL ME,  YOU HAVE COME TO SAVE ME. WITH CONDITIONS. I'LL GIVE YOU  ANYTHING. ANYTHING YOU WANT. JUST WHAT IS IT YOU WANT? THERE'S NOTHING  I WANT FROM YOU. JUST SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO. TELL ME AND IT'S DONE. IT'S DONE. THEY'RE GOING TO HUNT FOR YOU. I DON'T THINK YOU HAVE THAT MANY FRIENDS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD. WELL...ONLY ENEMIES. PRECISELY. YOU NEED TO BECOME A NEW PERSON. UNDERGO A SEA CHANGE. AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND  THAT POWER WILL NO LONGER SIMPLY BE IN THE HANDS  OF BRUTES LIKE YOU, BUT IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE  WHO HAVE BETTER WEAPONS, AND WHO KNOW HOW TO USE THEM. I SEE. I HOPE THAT YOU DO. GO TO THE MOUNTAINS. THE NORDS WILL BE STAYING  CLOSE BY THE SEA. THANK YOU, SORCERESS. I PROMISE YOU ONE THING. WHETHER I CHANGE OR NOT,  I WILL BE BACK. WITH BETTER WEAPONS. AND THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY. WHAT KIND OF PRIESTS ARE THESE? THE WRONG KIND. THEY HAVE POWER OVER EVERYONE. AND THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE  OF THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT  TO DO THIS? YES, TAO WOULD DO IT FOR ME. WHATEVER HAPPENS. I'M NOT AFRAID.  AND I'LL BE CAREFUL. [ KNOCKING ] WHAT'S THIS? I'M CALLED MARA. AND WHAT DO YOU WANT, MARA? THEY SAY THAT PRIESTS SOMETIMES GRANT FAVOURS. TRUE. BUT A FAVOUR REQUIRES FAVOURS IN RETURN. UNDERSTAND? I'M AFRAID THAT  I AM ALL I HAVE TO OFFER. I'M PLEASED THAT YOU  HAVE TIME FOR ME. I HEARD THAT YOU'RE  SACRIFICING AN EIRON. HMM... I HAVE A  FEW MINUTES. YOU HAVEN'T ASKED  WHAT FAVOUR I SEEK. NAME IT. DEATH TO ALL YOU PRIESTS. WE'RE CHANGING THE PLAN. [ STRAINING ] THE ALMIGHTY SUN  IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SKY. IT HAS COMPLETED  ITS NOCTURNAL JOURNEY THROUGH THE UNDERWORLD. THE JOURNEY HAS TAKEN  OUR SUN'S STRENGTH. IT NEEDS TO BE FED. TO REVIVE OUR SUN, TO GIVE  IT BACK THE STRENGTH IT NEEDS TO FIRE THE HEAVENS AND BATHE OUR WORLD IN WARMTH AND LIGHT... WE OFFER THE BLOOD OF AN ENEMY, AN EIRON. AND WHEN YOU DO, THE BEASTMASTER  BECOMES YOUR ENEMY. AND WITH THAT, EVERY ANIMAL  IN EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE! ARGH! TAO, QUICKLY! DAR! NO, HE SAID WE SHOULD  GO, COME ON! YOU'RE SURE YOU  WON'T COME WITH US? NO, I HAVE SOME PEOPLE  IN THE MOUNTAINS. I SHOULD HAVE GONE  THERE LONG AGO. YES. A HANDFUL, BUT WE'LL START  OVER, REBUILD OUR SOCIETY. MAYBE I SHOULD GO WITH HER. I THINK YOU SHOULD FOLLOW  YOUR HEART, TAO. IT'LL TAKE YOU  WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. I'LL DO THAT. BUT THERE'S MORE  I HAVE TO DO HERE FIRST. I'LL JOIN YOU IN  THE MOUNTAINS SOON, CARO. PROMISE? YEAH. SHARAK WILL WATCH OVER HER. [ SIGHING ] DAR, CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? YOU WILL ANYWAY. YES, THAT'S VERY TRUE. IN THAT CASE, I'LL MAKE  A STATEMENT. WHAT HAPPENED  TO XINCA BOTHERS ME. I WANT TO SEE IT BACK  THE WAY IT WAS, FREE AND OPEN. LESS CIVILIZED. YEAH...MAYBE. ONE THING'S FOR SURE. I WILL BE BACK. I'M SURE  WE WILL BE.
