  IT'S TRULY ONE OF NATURE'S MOST BREATHTAKING ENVIRONMENTS. THE SOUNDS, THE COLOURS. EVERY BIRD AND MONKEY  SEEMS TO BE HAPPY. NO, THEY'RE SCARED. SCARED? WHAT? OF US. YEAH, AND RUH. OF COURSE, I MEAN,  WHO WOULDN'T BE? BUT, UH, RUH  CAN'T GET THEM UP THERE. HE'S CAUGHT SOMETHING. DOES THAT EVER BOTHER YOU, RUH KILLING OTHER ANIMALS?

 NO, IT'S NATURAL.  HE'S GOT TO EAT. WHY ARE THEY MAKING  SUCH A RACKET? THEY'RE SAFE FROM US. SEE, ANIMALS  ARE LIKE PEOPLE. THEY'RE AFRAID  OF STRANGERS. WE'RE THE  STRANGERS HERE. I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE FEAR ISN'T  THE FIRST RESPONSE. I DON'T THINK IT'S  GOING TO BE THIS ONE. HERE. OH, GREAT. THAT'S THE  LAST OF THE WATER. YOU DON'T HAVE TO  CARRY WATER HERE. IT'S BETTER THAN DYING THIRSTY. LOOK.

 IS THERE ANYTHING  YOU DON'T SEE? WHAT YOU DON'T SEE  GETS YOU INTO TROUBLE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S  GET OUT OF HERE. I'VE BEEN THINKING,  AS SOON AS WE GET BACK TO MY HOME IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD, I'M GOING TO MAKE A MAP  OF THIS PLACE. I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S  BEEN HERE BEFORE. -I DIDN'T SEE FOOTPRINTS.  -YOU DIDN'T SEE THEM? PROBABLY A HUNTER  TRYING TO FEED HIS FAMILY. NO, THEY WERE FEMALE. A WOMAN? OUT HERE ALONE? SHE WAS TALL. -HOW CAN YOU TELL?  -HER STRIDES, THEY WERE LONGER THAN YOURS. THEY WERE  MORE LIKE MINE. I'M GOING TO GET SOME WATER. OH, IF I... HAPPEN TO MEET HER I MIGHT BE A LITTLE WHILE. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... WHAT IS THIS? NO ONE'S EVER SEEN  ANYTHING LIKE IT. AND THERE ARE MORE OF THEM? MM-HMM. AND THEY KILLED MY MEN? WHAT WEAPONS WERE FOUND? NONE, KING ZAD. JUST OUR MEN'S SKULL HATCHETS...  BROKEN IN PIECES. SPLINTERED LIKE KINDLING. IT'S VERY POWERFUL. BUT THE WOUNDS  ARE DEEP AND CLEAN. WHAT KIND OF WEAPON DOES THIS? ONE WITH  A HARD EDGE. YES. AND LIKE THIS CREATURE,  UNLIKE ANY I'VE SEEN BEFORE. [ GROWLING ] THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME. YOU SAVED MY-- IT'S CALLED A MANLINK. I'VE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF IT. THAT'S ODD,  BECAUSE THE CHANCES ARE HE'S PROBABLY ONE  OF YOUR RELATIVES. MAYBE EVEN AN UNCLE -OR A COUSIN.  -WHAT? THE MANLINK ARE  AN ANCIENT RACE OF BEING. BEFORE YOUR MANKIND -- THEY LEFT THIS PART OF THE WORLD AGES AGO. SEEMS ALMOST HUMAN. BECAUSE IT IS. PART APE, PART MAN. THAT CAN ONLY BE MAGIC, SORCERY. NO, IN FACT, THIS CREATURE  IS MORE LIKE NATURE'S WAY OF TYING MAN  AND ANIMALS TOGETHER. A LINK, SO TO SPEAK, ONE  THAT MANY THOUGHT WAS MISSING. WHY WOULD THEY COME HERE? SOCIETIES ARE THE PRODUCTS  OF INDIVIDUALS. EVENTUALLY WE ALL  SEEK NEW TERRITORIES. WHY MINE? AND  WHY KILL MY MEN? WHEN ONE SET OF BEING ENTER  ANOTHER GROUP'S WORLD, VIOLENCE IS USUALLY -THE END RESULT.  -BUT THE CURIOUS THING IS, THE MANKLINKS LEFT TO AVOID  THAT KIND OF STUPIDITY. THEY WERE NEVER A VIOLENT RACE. WELL, I AM,  AND I WON'T HAVE MY MEN SLAUGHTERED BY A GROUP  OF MURDEROUS MONKEYS. NO, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WILL. WHERE DO I FIND THESE CREATURES? A LITTLE DEMON WHO LIVES  IN THE FOREST. PERHAPS SHE COULD HELP. [ GRUMBLING ] ALL RIGHT,  I WAS KNOCKED OUT BY A WOMAN. AND YOU THINK IT'S FUNNY. THAT'S JUST GREAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE  DIDN'T GIVE ME A WARNING. HOW WOULD THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? OH, SHE WAS STRONG. [ CHUCKLING ] WELL, NOW, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? AH, A QUIET ONE. I BET I CAN MAKE HER SCREAM... WITH PLEASURE AND PAIN. SO THAT'S HOW YOU WANT IT? JUST THE PAIN? IT'S THIS WAY. I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY. YEAH, PUTTING  YOUR FOOT IN MY MOUTH. SORRY. WELL, IT  CERTAINLY WAS A NEW WAY  TO SAY HELLO. WISH I THOUGHT  OF IT FIRST. I DIDN'T KNOW  IF I COULD TRUST YOU. DO I LOOK LIKE SOMEONE  WHO CAN'T BE TRUSTED? THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS  WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. MY NAME'S DAR. ARINA. ARINA, WE'RE LOOKING  FOR A FRIEND OF MINE. I THINK HE WAS  TAKEN CAPTIVE BY TERRONS. THERE ARE OTHERS IN THIS FOREST MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE TERRONS. BECAUSE I'M LOOKING  FOR SOMEONE AS WELL. I'M AFRAID IF WE DON'T MOVE  QUICKLY, THEY'LL BOTH DIE. WELL, I THINK  WE BETTER MOVE QUICKLY. TOGETHER WE MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE. OHHH! THAT WAS  TOTALLY UNNECESSARY. I'LL JUST, UH, I'LL JUST, UH, STAND BACK HERE --  I'M A BIT AFRAID OF HEIGHTS. YOU'RE A LOT CUTER  THAN YOUR BIG FRIENDS. I KNOW YOU WANT  TO FIND YOUR FRIEND, BUT IT WILL BE  TOO DIFFICULT IN THE DARK. THE GREAT DESERTS.  A PLACE CALLED THE NAMIB. YOU'RE A LONG WAY FROM HOME. THAT HOME DOESN'T  EXIST ANY MORE. KODO AND PODO WILL STEAL  EVERYTHING IF YOU LET THEM. YOU MADE A FRIEND FOR LIFE. AND YOUR LIFE? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? [ SIGHING ] THE MYDLANDS. I WAS BORN A SULA. I DON'T KNOW THAT TRIBE. THAT'S BECAUSE  THE TERRONS WIPED US OUT. I'M THE LAST ONE. THEN YOU'RE LIKE ME. MY PEOPLE WERE KILLED  IN A GREAT WAR... ALSO BY THE TERRONS. HOW DID YOU ESCAPE? I WAS A CHILD. MY MOTHER HID ME IN A FIELD OF WILDFLOWERS BEFORE SHE DIED. I GREW UP ALONE. LEARNED HOW TO LIVE. MY FRIEND, TOR,  AND HIS PEOPLE, THEY FOUND ME THEY TOOK ME TO THE UPLANDS. THEY CALLED ME ARINA. IT MEANS WILDFLOWER. YOU HAVE A VERY PRETTY NAME. AND YOU? UM... I GREW UP ALONE...  EXCEPT NO ONE FOUND ME. WELL, YOU FIGHT LIKE A WARRIOR. SOMEONE HAD TO TEACH YOU THAT. I, UH, I WATCH THE ANIMALS. I LEARNED FROM THEM. THEY TAUGHT ME. THEY STILL DO. IS YOUR FRIEND A WARRIOR TOO. [ LAUGHING ] NO... HE FIGHTS WITH HIS BRAIN. OH, A THINKER. AND HE TALKS TOO MUCH. HMM. I WANT YOU TO KNOW SOMETHING. I WOULDN'T HAVE BEATEN  THOSE TERRONS ONCE THEY HAD ME BY THE NECK. I OWE YOU MY LIFE. THEN WE'RE EVEN. DO YOU HAVE A WOMAN? I DID. NO MORE. NOT IN THIS LIFE. OH...PODO? TAO. MY NAME IS TAO. I'M FROM THE MIDDLE  OF THE WORLD. I WAS TRAVELLING THERE WITH MY FRIEND DAR WHEN YOU, UM, CREATURES GRABBED ME AND-- YOUR NAME IS DOH. YOU CAN'T TALK, AND YOU DON'T  UNDERSTAND WHEN I TALK, BUT YOU CAN READ AND WRITE. YOU WANT TO KNOW EVERYTHING. OH, I SEE, ABOUT THE LAND... AND THE PEOPLE --  YOU'RE TRAVELLERS LIKE ME -- EXCELLENT! THERE'S MANY THINGS  I WANT TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE AS WELL, LIKE, UH, UH, AH! LIKE, UH... WHERE ARE YOU FROM? WHY ARE YOU HERE? AND, AND WHAT YOU ARE? OH, THERE'S ONE MORE THING --  THE, UH, THE, UH, THE LEASH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. OH, I SEE, I SEE. HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW  TO STAY CLOSE YET. WHERE TO START? TELL ME YOUR NAME, HUMAN. I AM KING ZAD, RULER OF THE TERRITORIES. WHO ARE YOU? I AM CURUPIRA. YOU'RE A DEMON? IF YOU LIKE. -I DO LIKE.  -A FRIEND TOLD ME YOU NEED SOME HELP. I'M SEARCHING FOR  THE CREATURES CALLED MANLINKS. DO YOU KNOW THEM? OF COURSE. WHAT KIND OF ANIMALS ARE THEY? THEY'RE NOT ANIMALS. I THINK THEY'RE MORE HUMAN;  THEREFORE, NOT WORTH MUCH. THEY LOOK LIKE ANIMALS. DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING  IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WELL, YOU SAY YOU'RE A KING. YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE ONE. AND WHAT DO I LOOK LIKE? AN OLD MAN...WITH NO HAIR. DO YOU KNOW WHERE  I CAN FIND THEM? I ONLY CARE  ABOUT REAL ANIMALS... AND SOMETIMES HUMANS. I TAKE IT I'M NOT GOING TO GET  ANY MORE INFORMATION FROM YOU. ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED? DON'T YOU LIKE ME? YOU'RE VERY...CLEVER. IS THAT ALL YOU THINK? YOUR FEET ARE-- HA, HA, HA, HA, STRANGE. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMS TO BE PUT TOGETHER  VERY NICELY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? ONLY THAT I FIND YOU... VERY ATTRACTIVE,  LIKE A FRESH PEACH READY TO BE PLUCKED FROM THE TREE. HAVE YOU EVER FELT  A MAN'S LIPS... ON YOURS. OH, YES. [ CHUCKLING ] AHHH! [ GROANING ] AHHH, AHHH! YOU CAN FEEL  MY LIPS ANOTHER DAY. OH, THE MANLINKS ARE  IN A CANOPY OF THE RAINFOREST. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY'RE A LOT MORE  ATTRACTIVE THAN YOU ARE. [ ROARING ] WHAT IS IT? ANOTHER FRIEND. HE'S IN TROUBLE. I DON'T SEE  YOUR FRIEND. HE'S THE BIG ONE. WHAT'S GOING ON? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. MY FRIEND CAME INTO THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS AND MADE A KILL. HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS? THEY JUST TOLD ME. STAY HERE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M OFFERING A TRUCE. I'M TELLING THEM  WE MEAN NO HARM, THAT WE'RE ONLY  PASSING THROUGH THIS FOREST, WE DON'T MEAN TO STAY. AND THE TIGERS UNDERSTAND? YES. I DON'T THINK THEY BELIEVE YOU. BOTH AGAINST RUH ISN'T FAIR. IF THEY WANT TO FIGHT,  THEY FIGHT ME TOO. HE SAYS THEY TOOK  MY FRIEND THAT WAY. WE'D BETTER HURRY. AHH. SORCERESS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE VERY LUCKY. CURUPIRA USUALLY LEAVES MEN WITH  NOTHING LEFT BUT THEIR SKIN. THE LITTLE VIXEN. I'LL BREAK HER. NO, YOU WON'T. SHE'S A DEMON. SHE'S NOT ONE  OF YOUR SLAVE GIRLS. HOW DID YOU FIND ME HERE? WITH THIS. IT'S VERY USEFUL. IT'S MY THIRD EYE. IT LOOKS VERY HUMAN. IT IS. HERE, HAVE A LOOK, IF YOU LIKE. HERE. IT BELONGED TO BAHA THE SLAVER. HE WON'T BE NEEDING IT ANY MORE. HE HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM  WITH CURUPIRA AS WELL. AHHH. FASCINATING. PERHAPS YOU CAN USE IT TO HELP ME SEARCH  FOR THE MANLINKS. THE DEMON TOLD ME  THEY'RE IN THE RAINFOREST. YOU WANT ME TO  COME WITH YOU? I WOULD BE UTTERLY CHARMED AND CAPTIVATED BY YOUR COMPANY. PERHAPS I'LL SEE  YOU THERE, THEN. THE MANLINKS INTEREST ME, BUT TRAVELLING LIKE  A HUMAN DOESN'T. [ CHUCKLING ] DOH. FINISHED, WELL,  EVERYTHING I COULD, GIVEN THE TIME THAT I HAD. NOW THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU EVER  WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT THE TERRITORIES AND THE MYDLANDS AND THE DOWNS. NOW I'VE INCLUDED THE PEOPLE  THAT I'VE SEEN AND THE PLACES I'VE BEEN TO AND SOME OF THE CULTURAL CURIOSITIES...AND THIS. IT'S CALLED A MAP. THIS SHOWS YOU WHERE YOU ARE AND EVERY PLACE THAT YOU  WANT TO FIND. I'VE FOUND THIS AN  INVALUABLE TOOL IN MY TRAVELS. YOU SEEM TO BE  COMMUNICATING IN THE SAME WAY THAT DAR DOES WITH THE ANIMALS --  HE'S THE BEASTMASTER. HEY... DOH, DOH! I WOULDN'T GO OUT THERE. THE BIG ONES  WILL KILL YOU IF YOU DO. WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS TOR. I'M FROM THE UPLANDS. TAO, MIDDLE OF THE WORLD. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED  ABOUT OUR FRIENDS? I THOUGHT THEY  WERE FRIENDS. THINK CAREFULLY. -THEY'RE SCARED.  -SO AM I. THEY SEEMED TO HAVE COME HERE  TO LEARN ABOUT THIS PLACE. DO YOU KNOW WHY? A GREAT WAVE OF ICE  IS MOVING TO THE UPLANDS, DESTROYING EVERYTHING  IN ITS PATH. MY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR  A NEW PLACE TO LIVE AS WELL. I WAS SENT TO LEARN  WHAT FOODS ARE HERE -AND WHAT WE CAN GROW.  -THEY CAUGHT YOU. IT SEEMS DIFFERENT STYLES  OF LIFE DON'T ALWAYS TREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT. THEY CAN'T TALK,  BUT THEY CAN READ AND WRITE. MANLINKS STOPPED USING  THEIR THROATS TO MAKE SOUND A LONG TIME AGO. IT WAS SAFER TO BE QUIET IN THE FOREST. SO THEY CAN COMMUNICATE  WITHOUT WORDS. YES. ALL WE MUST DO  IS MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND -WE MEAN THEM NO HARM--  -IT WON'T WORK. -THE MANLINKS DON'T TRUST MEN.  -WHY? THEY WERE HERE BEFORE HUMANS. WHEN WE CAME, MAN ATE  FROM THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE. WE LEARNED HOW TO KILL. GENERATIONS OF MANLINKS  DIED AT THE HANDS OF HUMANS. THEY WON'T LET US GO. THEY'RE AFRAID,  IF THEY DO, THEIR -WHEREABOUTS WILL BE DISCOVERED.  -SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE SURVIVAL OF THEIR RACE  IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN US. IT'S THE WAY OF THE WORLD. IF IT WERE US, IT WOULD BE THE  SAME, DON'T YOU THINK? THEY'LL BE UP THERE SOMEWHERE. THE MANLINKS LIVE IN THE TREES. ARINA, STOP, STOP! IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.  HE UNDERSTANDS. YOU HAVE A GREAT POWER. IT'S A GIFT. WELL, IT'S ALSO POWERFUL. I ONLY ASKED HIM NOT TO STRIKE. DO ANIMALS ALWAYS  DO WHAT YOU ASK? SOMETIMES, THEY LISTEN, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'VE HEARD YOU. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY WEAPONS. -THEY'RE VERY STRONG.  -BUT PROBABLY NOT VERY QUICK. THIS IS THEIR ENVIRONMENT.  WE CAN'T ESCAPE THEM HERE. WE COULD CROSS THE PLATFORM,  JUMP INTO THE TREES. IF WE SLIP,  IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, -IT'S A LONG DOWN.  -IF WE STAY, WE'RE DEAD. IT'S NOW OR NEVER. ARINA, YOUR WEAPON, IS THAT MADE FROM STONE? NO. SOME KIND OF WOOD? MY PEOPLE IN THE UPLANDS,  THE NORDS, THEY CALL IT METAL. IT COMES FROM THE EARTH,  LIKE THE SHINY STONES. BUT IT'S A LOT HARDER,  AND IT DOESN'T BREAK. I'VE SEEN IT, I JUST, I DON'T  KNOW HOW IT GETS ITS SHAPE. THE NORDS USE GREAT FIRES  TO MAKE IT SOFT. AND THEN POUND IT  INTO WHATEVER SHAPE IS NEEDED. THIS IS USED FOR KILLING. AND OTHER THINGS. MY FRIEND TOR CAN TELL YOU  MORE ABOUT IT. HE'S ALWAYS MAKING NEW THINGS. HE SOUNDS LIKE MY FRIEND TAO. DOES TOR TALK A LOT? ALL THE TIME. THEY SEEM ALIKE. DO YOU THINK PEOPLE  CAN BE THE SAME EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE  FROM DIFFERENT PLACES? ANIMALS ARE, AND YOU AND I HAVE  THINGS IN COMMON. MY FRIEND SHARAK  HAS FOUND THE MANLINKS. IS SHARAK THE TIGER? NO, HE'S AN EAGLE. WHAT HAPPENED? YOU SLIPPED, BUT YOU'RE LUCKY. DOH SAVED YOUR LIFE. THANK YOU. OHHH! I THOUGHT IF I COULD MAKE A COMMOTION,  I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A MESSAGE TO MY FRIEND DAR. -I'M SURE HE'S LOOKING FOR ME.  -HE CAN LOOK. HE'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE. MAYBE NOT... BUT ONE OF HIS  ANIMAL FRIENDS MIGHT. EAGLES. I LOVE EAGLES. SO MAJESTIC. DOES SHE KNOW THE EAGLE  WILL BRING DAR? -SHE SUSPECTS SOMETHING.  -SHE LIKES ME. YES, BUT, UH, IF HUMANS  THREATEN HER WORLD, NEXT TIME SHE'LL TAKE YOUR LIFE  INSTEAD OF SAVING IT. WE'RE GETTING CLOSER. ALL RIGHT-- I WANT OUR LITTLE VISIT  TO BE A SURPRISE. BE SAFER IF WE WAITED  FOR THEM TO COME DOWN. WE COULD SET A TRAP. NO, WE'D BE WAITING A LONG TIME. -IT MAY BE TOO LATE.  -FIGHTING THEM IN THE TREES IS CERTAIN DEATH. -MY FRIEND IS WORTH IT.  -SO'S MINE. GOOD. LET'S GO. THERE. NO, MOST OF YOU MIGHT LOOK LIKE APES, BUT NONE OF YOU CAN CLIMB. WELL, WE'LL SPREAD  OUT, THEN. WAIT FOR THEM  TO COME DOWN. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. BRING ME FIRE. I WANT MORE SMOKE! SORCERESS, YOU MADE IT. WE'RE ABOUT TO HAVE  A LITTLE PARTY. IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,  YOU'RE GOING TO BURN DOWN THE WHOLE FOREST. AS LONG AS I KILL THE MANLINKS,  I DON'T CARE. VERY WELL. BUT THERE'S  A CERTAIN DEMON WHO MIGHT. OVER HERE! DAR, I KNEW YOU'D MAKE IT. WE'VE GOT TO FIND  A WAY OUT OF HERE. THEY'LL ESCAPE. THEY'LL  USE VINES TO REACH THE GROUND. THAT'S GREAT FOR THEM.  WHAT ABOUT US? WHAT ABOUT DAR? WHAT ABOUT DAR? ARINA! GO, GO. COME ON. ARINA, JUMP, JUMP NOW. COME ON. AFTER THEM! NOW! ARGHHH! YOU! AREN'T YOU PLEASED TO SEE ME? NOT AGAIN. BURN MY FOREST, WILL YOU? I SHOULD BURN YOU. WITH A KISS. BUT THE ANCIENT ONE SAID NO. RULES, THERE ARE TOO MANY RULES. NO KISS. JUST MY HOT BREATH. [ GASPING ] WHAT'S HE SAYING? HE HOPES WE'LL MEET AGAIN... AND HE WANTS YOU TO KNOW THAT  HE NEVER MEANT US ANY HARM. OH, ASK HIM WHAT HAPPENED? WHY DIDN'T THEY EVOLVE  INTO HUMAN BEINGS. WHY DID THEY FAIL? HE SAYS THAT THEY DIDN'T FAIL  AT BECOMING HUMAN. THEY SUCCEEDED  AT BECOMING WHO THEY ARE. OH. ONE MORE THING. WHY WERE THE TERRONS HERE? ACCORDING TO RAFIKI,  THE TERRONS THOUGHT THAT THE MANLINKS  KILLED SOME OF THEIR MEN. AND THEY DIDN'T? NO. SOMEONE ELSE  MADE IT LOOK THAT WAY. WHO? I'LL TELL YOU ON THE WAY. -LET'S GO.  -I'M ALL FOR THAT. YOU MADE A NEW FRIEND. I WONDER HOW LONG  HE CAN PUT UP WITH YOU. WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU'RE PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME. FIRST YOU KILLED THE TERRONS... THEN AN INNOCENT MANLINK TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY DID IT. WHO ARE YOU? CLEVER, BUT EVIL. OH, THE METAL GAVE YOU AWAY. WHO ARE YOU? A DANGEROUS GAME, ARINA. PLAY IT CAREFULLY. WH-WHAT HAPPENED? THIS IS A STRANGE WORLD. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO  TO MAKE IT OURS.
