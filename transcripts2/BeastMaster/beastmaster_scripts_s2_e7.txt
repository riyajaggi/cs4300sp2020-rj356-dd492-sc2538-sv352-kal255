  THESE ARE TIMES THAT TRY  OUR VERY SOULS. TIMES OF CHANGE... TIMES OF BETRAYAL... WHEN THE WORLD'S MAGNIFICENT  CAPACITY FOR MALICE, MADNESS, FOLLY, ENVY AND DESTRUCTION PUT ALL LIFE OUT OF BALANCE... AND ALL NATURE OUT OF PLACE... WHEN THOUGHTLESS INTRUSION  CAUSES GREATER PAIN, THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE  BUT ANGER... NO SOLUTION BUT RAGE!

 I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT  THE NATURE OF HEALING. YOU SEE, A SORE STOMACH, ACHING HEAD, SORE MUSCLES.  EVEN ITCHING. THESE HERBS CAN CURE  ALL OF THAT. BUT WHAT CURES  THE ACHES AND PAINS BROUGHT ON BY OUR EMOTIONS  AND BY OUR HEART? FRIENDS HELP. TALKING TO PEOPLE, AND ANIMALS YOU TRUST. EXACTLY. WE'RE THINKING THE SAME THING. IF A SNAKE BITES YOU,  YOU USE THE YELLOW HERB TO DRAW OUT THE POISON, WHEN  THE POISON'S GONE, YOU HEAL. WITH AN EMOTIONAL PAIN,  IT'S TALKING

 THAT DRAWS OUT THE POISON. TALKING WITH FRIENDS  AND PEOPLE WE TRUST. I GUESS ANIMALS, IN YOUR CASE,  WOULD BE INCLUDED. SOMETHING'S HAPPENING  IN XINCA. SOMEBODY'S HAVING SOME FUN. WE SHOULD GO TAKE A LOOK. BEASTMASTER. VODEN. YOU MAY SHEATH YOUR WEAPON. YOU AND YOUR EIRON FRIEND  ARE SAFE WITHIN THE CITY. IT'S TAO, IS IT NOT? I'M TOLD YOU'RE A MAN  OF WISDOM AND HEALING. JUST NOT WISE ENOUGH  TO STAY AWAY FROM HERE. HA! HA! I LIKE A MAN OF WIT. MY PRESENT COMPANY  DON'T OFTEN EXCEL IN THE ART OF CONVERSATION. I'LL LEAVE YOU TO YOUR BUSINESS.  PERHAPS LATER, WE'LL TALK? WHO WANTS TO BE NEXT? THERE MUST BE OTHERS IN XINCA WHO'D LIKE TO TEST THEIR SKILLS! AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS TEST? SIMPLY THE JOY OF SPORT. JOY OF SPORT? THAT'S ALL? WELL IF MY PERFORMANCE IS GOOD, YOU'RE WELCOME TO  SHOW YOUR APPRECIATION. I'LL GLADLY ACCEPT  FOOD AND DRINK. CARE TO COMPETE? NO. I DON'T  COMPETE THAT WAY. WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE HERE? HE LOOKS LIKE A FIGHTER. YOU LOOK LIKE A WORTHY OPPONENT. WELL, THAT MAY BE, BUT...  I DON'T FIGHT FOR FUN. IT WOULD REALLY GIVE THEM A SHOW. SURE I CAN'T CONVINCE YOU? I THINK I CAN. SORRY. NOT TODAY. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... SO WHAT ARE  YOU GONNA DO? SELF-CONTROL IS THE  MASTER OF ABILITY. MAKE A MAN LOSE HIS CONTROL  AND YOU BECOME THE MASTER. WATCH. VERY GOOD. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN  FIGHTING ME... NOT YOURSELF. [ GROWLING ] [ GROWLING ] -YOU ALL RIGHT?  -DID YOU SEE THAT? WHAT I SAW  WAS IMPOSSIBLE. -WHAT I HEARD WAS IMPOSSIBLE.  -WHAT? I'M GOING AFTER HIM. DAR. I'VE WARNED YOU. ANCIENT ONE. YOU LOOK ANGRY. RUNNING OUT OF PATIENCE WOULD  BE A MORE EXACT DESCRIPTION. WHY? BECAUSE CERTAIN CHILDREN  FAIL TO LISTEN. I AM NOT A CHILD. YOU ACT LIKE ONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN. HUMAN AFFAIRS  AND THEIR PIDDLING EMOTIONS ARE NONE OF YOUR CONCERN. I-I DON'T-- OH...PERHAPS YOU  FORGET WHO I AM? WHEN I CHOOSE, I CAN THINK WHAT YOU THINK, KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW,  AND SEE WHAT YOU SEE. SO I SUGGEST YOU FORGET  ALL OF THE ABOVE IN RESPECT TO WHAT  YOU'VE JUST SEEN IN XINCA. YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE. YOU DON'T PRACTICE  WHAT YOU PREACH. AND YOU'RE STEPPING VERY CLOSE  TO THE EDGE, MY DEAR. YOU MUST HAVE SOME INTEREST  IN THAT BOY OR YOU WOULD NEVER BE  THIS ANGRY. IF YOU FALL, IT'S FOREVER. DO YOU KNOW HOW  LONG THAT IS? NO. TELL ME. ABOUT THE BOY...OR FOREVER? THEY BOTH TAKE YOU SOMEWHERE  YOU DON'T WANT TO GO. AMBIGUITIES, RIDDLES,  SILLY PROVERBS. THAT'S ALL YOU EVER SAY. NEVER THE TRUTH ABOUT ANYTHING. YOU NEVER MEANT TO TEACH ME  ABOUT YOUR WORLD. ONLY TEASE ME AND CONTROL ME. ENOUGH! FOOLS TALK. THE WISE LISTEN. TAKE THAT ADVICE. AND FORGET. SILK. THE FINEST. IT'S ALWAYS BEEN YOUR FAVOURITE. IT LOOKS QUITE GOOD. IT BRINGS OUT THE  COLOUR IN YOUR FACE. I MISS THAT. I CAN'T IMPRESS YOU? NOT EVEN A BIT? COLD. EVEN THOUGH  THE COLOURS ARE WARM. I WANT TO SEE YOU SMILE. IS THAT ASKING TOO MUCH? PLEASE? I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR ANGER. I'VE DONE NOTHING. CERTAINLY NOTHING TO YOU. ANGER IS A POISON. IT DESTROYS. IT'S WHAT'S MAKING YOU SICK. THAT UPSETS ME. I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY. THAT'S ALL I WANT... MOTHER. [ GROWLING ] I ONLY BECOME THE PUMA WHEN... WHEN I'M ANGRY. VERY ANGRY. YOU WERE VERY ANGRY IN XINCA. NO, I WAS ANGRY AT MYSELF. IT FELT LIKE YOU WERE  ANGRY AT ME. I'M SORRY. NO NEED. I DON'T LIKE TO FIGHT.  NOT LIKE THAT. SO WHY DO YOU DO IT? IT'S A WAY TO GET RID  OF THE ANGER FROM INSIDE. BEFORE... WELL, SO I DON'T DO  ANYTHING REALLY BAD. YOU SEE, I'VE THIS FRIEND  WHO HAS AN IDEA THAT YOU CAN GET RID OF BAD  EMOTIONS BY TALKING. ALL RIGHT. YOU SAY THAT WHEN YOU CHANGE  INTO THE CAT, IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE ANGRY. BUT THAT'S NOT NATURAL. SO DO YOU KNOW WHY  IT REALLY HAPPENS? YES. AND I HATE IT. I'M A MAN. NOT SOME WILD ANIMAL. IT WAS UNFAIR! SOME DAY, I'LL RIGHT THE WRONG. THANK YOU FOR THE TALK. MAYBE YOUR FRIEND'S IDEA  IS A GOOD ONE. DON'T! AND DON'T FOLLOW ME. YOU DON'T TRUST ME. I DO. BUT THIS IS NONE  OF YOUR CONCERN. YOU KNOW THAT THERE-- NO. [ SORCERESS ]: LET'S TURN  BACK THE HANDS OF TIME. [ ANCIENT ONE ]:  I'VE WARNED YOU. YOU'RE BECOMING QUITE THE SPARK. DEATH. IT'S COMING FOR YOU. [ ANCIENT ONE ]: MEDDLING  IN MY AFFAIRS AGAIN. [ SORCERESS ]: ALL IN GOOD TIME. [ ANCIENT ONE ]: BECAUSE CERTAIN CHILDREN FAIL TO LISTEN. WE CAN OVERTHROW HIM, SHARAK. [ ANCIENT ONE ]: IF YOU PLAY  WITH FIRE, YOU'LL GET BURNT. IF YOU FALL, IT'S FOREVER. DON'T MOVE. ONE SMALL FAVOUR. YOU'LL BE FREE. AND SOMEONE ELSE WILL CAPTIVE BE. FOREVER. YOU'RE SURE? ABSOLUTELY SURE? YES. IT WAS BAHKTIAR? THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE HIM  AND BRING HIM TO ME? WHEN HE RAN OFF, THE BEASTMASTER  WENT AFTER HIM. THEY CAN'T BE FAR. I CAN FIND  THEM QUICKLY. BUT...I WANT ONE OF THEM  ALIVE AND ONE OF THEM DEAD. TO BE SAFE, I HAVE  A BETTER IDEA. YOU ALWAYS DO. YES. THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.  YOU SHOULD LOOK AT THIS. HAVE YOU NOTICED HOW THE  SUN IS CASTING A SHADOW ACROSS THIS PLATE HERE? WELL, THIS SHADOW IS MOVING  SLOWLY THE WHOLE TIME. I COULD MEASURE FROM... KING VODEN. I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE COME ALONE. ALL THESE SOLDIERS. GIVES PEOPLE THE  WRONG IMPRESSION. NOT TODAY -- BECAUSE TODAY, I'M NOT COMING TO YOU AS A KING, SIMPLY AS A MAN, A HUMBLE MAN, WHO WOULD LIKE  TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP. MANY HEALERS  HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO  HELP MY MOTHER. HERBS, POTIONS,  SPELLS. ALL KINDS  OF MEDICINES. BUT NOTHING  SEEMS TO WORK. MAYBE THE PROBLEM  ISN'T PHYSICAL. I'VE OFTEN  THOUGHT THAT. BUT THEN, WHAT  COULD IT BE? WELL, EMOTIONAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL. DOES SHE SEEM ANGRY OR AFRAID? SHE DOES SEEM ANGRY  AND PERHAPS AFRAID, BUT HOW TO TELL? SHE'S GIVEN UP  ON TALKING. BE THE SIGN THAT  THE PROBLEM ISN'T PHYSICAL. YOU KNOW, MAYBE SHE'S  BOTTLING SOMETHING UP INSIDE. SOMETHING SHE'S  AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT. YOU HAVE THE  REPUTATION OF BEING A VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE MAN,  I CAN SEE WHY. YOU COULDN'T HELP  MY MOTHER TO TALK? HEAL HER? I DON'T KNOW IF  I CAN HEAL ANYONE, BUT, UH...I'VE BEEN  THINKING THAT IF SOMEONE HAS AN EMOTIONAL PROBLEM,  IF THAT'S WHAT THIS IS, THEN TALKING WITH SOMEONE  THAT YOU TRUST CAN HELP. NATURALLY, THE TRICK IS TO GET THAT PERSON TO TALK --  HAVE YOU TRIED? OF COURSE, BUT I'M JUST A SIMPLE  BOY WHO HAPPENS TO BE KING. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD  TALK TO MY POOR MOTHER? -I'D BE GLAD TO.  -YOU WOULD?  -OF COURSE. IT MIGHT HELP HER AND I COULD  TRY OUT SOME OF MY THEORIES. THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. YOUR SON, KING VODEN,  TELLS ME YOU'VE BEEN SICK. HE'S WORRIED ABOUT YOU --  HE'S WONDERING IF I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP. I HAVE THIS THEORY THAT... WHEN AN ILLNESS DOESN'T  APPEAR TO BE PHYSICAL, WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE CASE HERE, THEN PERHAPS  THE PROBLEM IS EMOTIONAL. I THINK THAT... IF PEOPLE COULD TALK TO ONE  ANOTHER ABOUT THEIR FEELINGS, THAT MAYBE IT'D HELP. IT MIGHT BE THE CURE  THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. YOU WANT TO TELL ME WHAT  YOU'RE FEELING RIGHT NOW? [ SIGHING ] WHERE TO START? I FEEL SO MANY THINGS. SORROW, FEAR, RAGE. AND WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT  WHEN YOU FEEL THESE THINGS? MY SON. I'M ALWAYS THINKING ABOUT HIM. AND WHAT ARE YOU  THINKING ABOUT HIM? HIS GENTLE MANNER, HIS KIND HEART. WELL, THAT'S... A SIDE THAT ONLY  A MOTHER COULD SEE. THESE ARE GOOD QUALITIES. WHY WOULD THEY MAKE YOU SAD? BECAUSE THEY'LL BE  THE DEATH OF HIM. THAT'S WHY  I'M AFRAID AND SO VERY, VERY ANGRY. WHEN I THINK ABOUT  WHAT HAPPENED-- WHY DOES GOOD COUNT FOR NOTHING  AND EVIL FOR SO MUCH? YOU'RE TALKING!  THIS IS WONDERFUL. NOW AREN'T YOU GLAD  YOU DECIDED TO COME MEET TAO? I DID NOT  DECIDE ANYTHING. YOU HAD YOUR WARRIORS BRING ME HERE. NOT AS MUCH PROGRESS  AS I'D HOPED. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU...  IN PRIVATE. I'D LIKE TO COME.  I FEEL WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. THESE THINGS OFTEN TAKE  A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO... YOU WAIT HERE. IF I NEED YOU, YOU'LL  BE THE FIRST TO KNOW. WAIT. THIS IS FAR ENOUGH. I HAVE NEWS FOR YOU, MOTHER. NEWS I'D RATHER NOT  SHARE WITH STRANGERS SUCH AS TAO -- WE'VE FOUND YOUR GOLDEN BOY. AND IT'S ONLY A  MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE'S PERSUADED  TO RETURN TO US. [ GROWLING ] WHAT IS THIS ANIMAL... SO ANGRY? WHY DOES IT LOOK AT ME  SO STRANGELY? WHAT DOES IT WANT? IF IT COMES ANY CLOSER, KILL IT! QUICKLY, BACK TO XINCA. I SAW WHAT HAPPENED! I'M NOT WITH THE NORDS...  OR KING VODEN. I THINK I CAN HELP YOU. BUT FIRST,  YOU HAVE TO LET ME TRY. WHY DO YOU THINK  YOU CAN HELP ME? BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOUR RAGE. AND I KNOW WHO CAUSES IT. BUT WHAT YOU HAVE  TO DO IS TELL ME WHY. MAYBE WE SHOULD  START WITH NAMES. I'M CALLED DAR. I'M BAHKTIAR. ONCE, A LONG TIME AGO,  I WAS PRINCE BAHKTIAR. I WANTED TO TALK TO  HER MYSELF, BUT WE WERE... I THINK IT'S BETTER  SHE SPEAK WITH YOU. YOU CAN'T HELP ME.  NO ONE CAN HELP ME. I'D LIKE TO TRY. I DON'T DESERVE YOUR KINDNESS. EVERYONE DESERVES  KINDNESS. WHAT I HAVE DONE IS SO TERRIBLE. I WILL HAVE TO LIVE  WITH THE SHAME OF THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I AM A PRISONER,  NOT JUST THE PRISONER OF MY SON AND HIS GUARDS. I AM A PRISONER OF MY HEART,  FOR WHAT I DID. PLEASE, GO ON. VODEN IS NOT MY ONLY CHILD. I HAD... I MEAN, I HAVE ANOTHER SON. A LOVELY BOY. HIS NAME IS BAHKTIAR. THE WOMAN YOU SAW, THE ONE BEING HELD BY THE NORDS,  IS MY MOTHER, MARGRET. YOUR MOTHER? THAT MEANS  THAT VODEN... IS MY BROTHER. YOU'RE RIGHT. HE PROVOKES THE  WORST OF MY ANGER. BUT I COULDN'T ATTACK HIM. -NOT IN FRONT OF OUR MOTHER.  -WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG BOYS, BAHKTIAR WAS VERY ATHLETIC. THE GIRLS LIKED HIM. VODEN WAS JEALOUS. AND HIS JEALOUSY GREW  INTO DECEIT AND WICKEDNESS. -I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.  -CHILDREN OFTEN OUTGROW IT. BUT VODEN WAS NEVER  REALLY A CHILD. AT LEAST, NOT HERE. HE ALWAYS THOUGHT LIKE AN ADULT, BUT WITH THE EMOTIONS  OF A CHILD. DANGEROUS COMBINATION. AND HE GREW INTO  A VERY CRUEL YOUNG MAN... WHICH IS WHAT HE IS TODAY. AT FIRST, IT WAS SILLY THINGS, THEN IT GREW INTO OTHER THINGS. AND LIES. TO MY MOTHER, THEN TO OTHERS HE WOULD ACCUSE ME OF STEALING. KILLING OTHER PEOPLE'S ANIMALS. BEATING OTHER BOYS AND WORSE. I KNEW HE WAS JEALOUS OF ME. AND HE KNEW HIS LIES  MADE ME VERY ANGRY. THEN ONE DAY, WE HAD A FIGHT. IT WAS TERRIBLE. I BEAT HIM BADLY. I KNEW I SHOULD HAVE STOPPED, BUT I COULDN'T CONTROL THE  RAGE THAT WAS INSIDE OF ME. IT DIDN'T TEACH VODEN A LESSON? NO. IN FACT, HE ENJOYED IT. VODEN WAS VERY CLEVER, IN AN EVIL WAY. HE KNEW THE MORE HIS  BROTHER BEAT HIM, THE WORSE IT MADE BAHKTIAR LOOK  IN THE EYES OF OTHERS. TO SEE ONE BROTHER  SET AGAINST THE OTHER. IT WAS. BUT IT WAS BAHKTIAR  WHO SUFFERED THE MOST. HE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF  WITH GUILT, REMORSE. HE BEGGED VODEN'S FORGIVENESS. WHAT DID VODEN DO? HE LAUGHED. HE'D WON, YOU SEE. I WANTED TO  LOVE MY BROTHER. BUT HOW DO YOU LOVE SOMEONE  WHO DOESN'T HAVE A HEART? I KNEW THAT ONE DAY, I WOULDN'T JUST BEAT HIM. I'D KILL HIM. HE WAS IN  SUCH DESPAIR. THE RAGE WAS POISONING HIM. SO I CALLED ON A SORCERER  THAT I KNEW FOR HELP. AN OLDER MAN. NOT VERY PLEASANT, BUT WE... KNEW EACH OTHER. HE SAID THERE WOULD  BE TWO CONDITIONS. I HAD TO SEND BAHKTIAR AWAY, AND I HAD TO ACCEPT THE FACT  I MIGHT NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. HE SAID BAHKTIAR FEARED  HIS OWN RAGE. SO HE PUT A CURSE ON HIM. WHENEVER THE RAGE  WELLS UP INSIDE HIM, THE CURSE TAKES OVER. DOES VODEN KNOW THIS? NO. HE ASKED YOU TO  TALK TO ME BECAUSE HE THINKS I KNOW  WHERE BAHKTIAR IS. DO YOU? BUT I THINK IF VODEN FINDS HIM,  HE WILL KILL US BOTH. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW? FREE MY MOTHER. BUT I CAN'T HELP HER  AS AN ANIMAL. I HAVE TO DO IT AS A MAN. SO YOU SHALL...  AND NEVER MORE A PUMA BE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MORE TO THE POINT.  WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING? MEDDLING IN MY AFFAIRS AGAIN? CHANGING THE PUMA INTO THE BOY? AS A FAVOR. SO THE BEASTMASTER WOULD  KNOW WHO HE IS AND... BE ABLE TO HELP HIM. HAVE YOU MADE HIM A PUMA AGAIN? I'VE REMOVED THE CURSE  FROM HIM PERMANENTLY. YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. I AM THE SORCERER QUEEN MARGRET  CAME TO, IN HER TIME OF NEED. SO ALL THE LECTURES  YOU GAVE ME... THE DIRE WARNINGS NOT TO MEDDLE IN THE PIDDLING EMOTIONS  OF HUMAN BEINGS-- SEEMS HYPOCRITICAL TO YOU? YES, YES, IT DOES. YOU SAY ONE THING  AND YET DO ANOTHER. IT NEVER  OCCURRED TO YOU THAT I MIGHT BE TRYING TO SAVE  YOU FROM REPEATING MY MISTAKE? MY ONE ERROR IN AN OTHERWISE  PERFECT RECORD? YOU ADMIT TO MAKING A MISTAKE? WHAT, IS THIS THE DAY  THAT HELL FREEZES OVER? IN A CERTAIN SENSE. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AMUSING  TO...FALL IN LOVE. TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND  WHAT MADE HUMANS LOSE ALL SENSE OF PROPORTION. OR RATIONALITY. AND TO OTHERWISE  ACT LIKE IDIOTS. YOU WERE IN LOVE  WITH QUEEN MARGRET? I WAS. AND IT WAS EVERYTHING  I SUSPECTED. WHAT HAPPENED? SHE WAS A WIDOW  WITH TWO YOUNG SONS, TRYING TO RULE UNTIL THE  ELDEST COULD TAKE OVER. OUR RELATIONSHIP  DIDN'T LAST LONG. SHE FELT IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE. SHE SENT ME AWAY. HMM, THE REJECTED LOVER. HOW TRAGIC. SHE CAME TO ME YEARS LATER,  NEEDING HELP FOR BAHKTIAR. I KNEW I SHOULDN'T BECOME  INVOLVED AGAIN, BUT I DID. LOVE WAS STILL STRANGLING  MY RATIONALE. IT'S... IT'S INSIDIOUS THE WAY IT... I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN  YOUR PROBLEM. NO, I MEAN-- YOU MEAN...WHY AM I OPENING UP MY HEART  TO YOU IN THIS FASHION? I THINK YOU DO UNDERSTAND. BECAUSE... IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW. YOU SEE, IT'S ONE  OF THE LAST THINGS YOU'LL EVER UNDERSTAND. SO I'M TO BE PUNISHED  FOR THE SAME MISTAKE YOU JUST CONFESSED  TO MAKING YOURSELF? MY WORST MISTAKE WAS TO  GIVE YOU SO MANY CHANCES. FAR TOO MANY. IT'S CLEAR YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE. I'VE FAILED WITH YOU. DON'T BE SO HARD  ON YOURSELF, OLD MAN. OH, INSOLENT AND  IRREVERENT TO THE LAST. YOU REALLY  DON'T UNDERSTAND. NO, YOU'RE THE ONE  WHO DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. ALL THIS TIME, YOU SAY YOU'VE  BEEN TEACHING ME AND YOU HAVE. BUT WHAT I'VE LEARNED  IS TO VALUE THOSE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE ME BELIEVE LIKE HUMAN EMOTIONS,  LOVE AND JOY AND HOPE. WHAT OF DESPAIR,  SORROW AND PAIN? YES, YES, THOSE TWO FEELINGS. THEY'RE ALL THAT REALLY MATTER. UNLESS YOU FEEL, WHAT IS THERE? MORE THAN YOU'LL EVER KNOW. YOU'RE AFRAID OF FEELINGS. YOU TRIED THEM ONCE. COULDN'T CONTROL THE OUTCOME  AND YOU GOT HURT, SO YOU RUN FROM THEM. FOR ALL YOUR KNOWLEDGE AND ALL YOUR POWER... YOU'RE A COWARD. I COULD ARGUE WITH YOU,  BUT YOU'RE TOO HUMAN TO UNDERSTAND. NO! I GIVE YOU FOREVER TO CONTEMPLATE  YOUR LIMITATIONS. WE ARE OF NO FURTHER  USE TO ONE ANOTHER. GOODBYE, MY LITTLE LOVELY. MY FRIENDS WILL HELP US.  WE SHOULD HURRY. BEFORE WE GET THERE, REGARDLESS OF  WHAT HAPPENS, I WANT TO THANK YOU. -KEEP A GOOD EYE.  -BROTHER! GO, GET SOME OF THE  OTHER MEN QUICKLY. BAHKTIAR. IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG TIME. I'VE COME FOR MY MOTHER. REALLY? AND NO OTHER GREETINGS  AFTER ALL THESE YEARS? YOU DISAPPOINT ME. I HAVE NO GREETINGS  FOR YOU, VODEN. AND YOU WON'T HAVE  OUR MOTHER, EITHER. YOU THOUGHT IT  WOULD BE THAT SIMPLE -- COME TO ME, ASK AND WALK AWAY? YOU KEEP HER A PRISONER. SHE ISN'T WELL. THE PRICE OF HAVING SUCH A SON. WATCH YOUR TONGUE, BROTHER. OR I'LL CUT IT OUT. IT WOULD BE A SHAME; I WANT  TO HEAR YOU BEG FOR YOUR LIFE. LIKE I BEGGED, WHEN  YOU USED TO BEAT ME. DO YOU REMEMBER? WHERE'S THAT BOY NOW? THE FIGHTER, THE ATHLETE. THE ONE EVERYBODY THOUGHT  WAS A GIFT FROM THE HEAVENS. WHERE IS HE NOW, BAHKTIAR? QUICKLY! VODEN WANTS US! NOW, IN THE MARKETPLACE. YOU TWO, STAY THERE! COME WITH ME! WHAT'S WRONG? HURRY! HEY! WELL, THIS ISN'T  VERY FAIR, IS IT? YOU'VE GOT THAT BIG, METAL KNIFE  AND I'VE JUST GOT... MY FRIEND. DON'T BE AFRAID,  DON'T BE AFRAID. I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. -BAHKTIAR IS HERE.  -BAHKTIAR. WE WILL TAKE YOU TO WHERE  WE'RE GOING TO MEET. NO, HE'LL PROTECT YOU,  I PROMISE. TRUST ME. THANK YOU. I WANT THE PLEASURE OF MY  BROTHER'S DEATH IN PRIVATE. I WON'T FIGHT YOU, BUT NO  ONE'S TAKING ME ANYWHERE. YOUR MOTHER'S SAFE.  WE SHOULD HURRY. BEASTMASTER! YOU'RE A VERY DANGEROUS MAN. BUT IN MY OWN WAY, SO AM I. CONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS,  BEASTMASTER. CONSIDER THEM CAREFULLY. I HAVE TO GET MY FRIEND BACK. NO. YOUR MOTHER IS WAITING  FOR YOU IN THE FOREST. SHE NEEDS YOU. VODEN, MAYBE WE CAN  TALK ABOUT THIS. THERE'S NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. EITHER HE BRINGS THEM  BACK OR YOU'RE DEAD. THAT CERTAINLY  ISN'T VERY FAIR. IT IS FAIR IN MY WORLD. BEASTMASTER. I'M A DANGEROUS MAN,  VODEN. REMEMBER? SEE, YOU'D DO WELL TO  KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY. MOTHER! BAHKTIAR... AH, I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. LET ME LOOK AT YOU. CAN YOU FORGIVE ME? [ CRYING ] YOU'RE LETTING HIM  GET AWAY WITH THIS. FOR NOW. I HAVE TO REMEMBER WHAT I REALLY WANT  FROM THIS BEASTMASTER. I WILL NEVER FORGET YOU, TAO. NEVER FORGET WHAT YOU  HAVE DONE FOR ME, FOR US. WE'LL BE SAFE IN THE DOWNS. WE HAVE FRIENDS THERE. DON'T FORGET, YOU'LL ALWAYS  HAVE FRIENDS HERE TOO. WELL, I WAS RIGHT. TALKING, AND HOW IT HEALS  EMOTIONAL WOUNDS. DO YOU WHAT  SURPRISED ME THE MOST? NO, BUT I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING  TO TELL ME. I HAD NO IDEA THAT  SOMETHING SO SIMPLE COULD ALSO BE SO POWERFUL. I MEAN, YOUR TALK WITH BAHKTIAR  TOOK AWAY HIS CURSE. HE DIDN'T TURN  INTO A WILD ANIMAL, EVEN THOUGH VODEN  PUT HIM INTO A RAGE. TALKING TOOK AWAY HIS FEAR. YEAH, I THINK  YOU'RE RIGHT. I THINK WE SHOULD  DO THAT MORE OFTEN. WHAT? TALK. ABSOLUTELY, I INTEND TO. AH, SOMEHOW, I KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SAY THAT.
