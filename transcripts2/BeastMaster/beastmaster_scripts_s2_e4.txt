  [ LAUGHING ] DAR! DAR WINS IT. HE'S NOT A HAPPY CAT. WE HAVE UNTIL THE SUN SETS. WHAT'S WRONG? CAN YOU HEAR THAT? MMM. IT'S A NEW VOICE. I HAVEN'T HEARD IT BEFORE. THAT'S NOT SURPRISING,  NOT TODAY.

 TODAY IS A DAY OF CHANGE. TOMORROW'S THE BEGINNING  OF THE NEW SEASON. TODAY'S SUN IS AS LOW  AS IT WILL GET IN THE SKY. THAT'S ALSO A DAY WHEN SPIRITS WALK THE EARTH AND CURSES HAVE  THEIR GREATEST POWER. I DIDN'T THINK YOU BELIEVED  IN SUPERSTITIONS. I DON'T, BUT THEY MAKE  FOR GREAT STORIES. I'LL TRY AND THINK  OF THEM BEFORE NIGHTFALL. WHAT'S HAPPENING? THEY'RE FRIGHTENED. OF WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. [ SCREAMING ]

 WHAT ARE YOU GOING  TO DO ABOUT THIS, DAR? WHAT'S SHE  DOING HERE? I'M DEMANDING REVENGE. WHAT DID THIS? A BLACK PANTHER. -ANIMALS KILL TO EAT.  -THIS WASN'T A KILL FOR FOOD. FIND THIS ANIMAL AND DESTROY IT. -WELL, THEN, BRING IT TO ME.  -I CAN'T DO THAT. YOU'LL DO IT OR... OR YOU'LL NEVER SEE YOUR  LITTLE FRIEND AGAIN. [ YELLING ] IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... IARA! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? HUNTING, LIKE YOU. I DON'T HUNT. THERE'S NO WAY OUT. INSURANCE, IN CASE DAR DECIDES  HE'S GOT SOMETHING BETTER TO DO THAN CATCH  THE PANTHER FOR ME. YOU DON'T KNOW HIM  TOO WELL, THEN, DO YOU? NO, I DON'T, BUT I'D LIKE TO. I'D LIKE TO KNOW  EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM. WHO'S THAT WOMAN HE'S WITH? -DAR'S WITH A WOMAN?  -BURNISHED COPPER SKIN  AND FEATHERS. ARINA -- THAT WORRIES HIM MORE THAN THE  PANTHER HE'S CHASING. IS SHE A DANGER TO HIM? NO MORE THAN YOU ARE TO HIM. YOU'RE THE BEASTMASTER'S  LITTLE FRIEND, NOT MINE. I OVERHEARD YOUR CONVERSATION  ABOUT THE PANTHER. I CAN HELP. BECAUSE A ROGUE ANIMAL LIKE THIS  IS A DANGER TO ALL OF US. WHY ARE YOU  FOLLOWING ME? WHY DON'T WE JUST CONCENTRATE  ON FINDING THIS PANTHER? I THINK WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT  IS FINDING OUT WHY IT KILLS FOR PLEASURE  AND NOT FOR FOOD. WELL, THEN, TWO PAIRS OF EYES AND TWO SETS OF HANDS  MIGHT BE HELPFUL. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE AT HOME  IN THIS FOREST, BEASTMASTER. WHO WAS THAT  WOMAN IN THE POND? IARA. THE SNAKE WAS ONE  OF HER CREATURES. WELL, HOW DO YOU  KNOW HER SNAKE DIDN'T ATTACK  THE PANTHER? BECAUSE IT'S STILL MOVING LIKE  IT'S HUNTING SOMETHING ELSE. ARINA. I MUST ADMIT I EXPECTED  YOU A LITTLE SOONER. I NEED TO KNOW IF  THE BEASTMASTER-- WILL GET RID OF THE PANTHER? THE PANTHER-- THAT'S NOT A PANTHER. BUT, THEN, OF COURSE,  YOU KNEW THAT. JUST AS YOU KNEW IT  WAS A WORTHY RIVAL WHEN YOU FIRST  SAW ITS HANDIWORK. CAN THE BEASTMASTER  DRIVE IT AWAY? THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THIS THAN  EVEN YOU REALIZE, IARA. THE PANTHER IS  FROM ANOTHER WORLD. IT DOES THE BIDDING  OF ONE CALLED ORPHEO. OH, NOW YOU REALLY ARE MEDDLING  IN PLACES YOU SHOULDN'T. I'M PROTECTING WHAT IS MINE. THEY DON'T WANT WHAT IS YOURS. THEY CAN ONLY BE IN  THIS WORLD FOR ONE DAY. WHEN THE SUN SETS, THEY MUST  RETURN FROM WHENCE THEY CAME, WHETHER THEY  LIKE IT OR NOT. YOU'RE SURE? I SUGGEST YOU ENJOY THEM  FOR WHAT THEY ARE. QUITE PERFECT,  QUITE BEAUTIFUL TO BEHOLD FAR MORE INTERESTING  THAN ANY OF YOUR HUMANS. OH, AND THAT REMINDS ME. YOU REALLY MUSTN'T KEEP THE BEASTMASTER'S LITTLE FRIEND. DONE! UGH! UGH! [ CHUCKLING ] SNAKES...THAT MAKES SENSE. LET'S GO NOW. JUMP NOW. [ GROANING ] THAT REALLY WASN'T VERY NICE. YOU ASKED ME TO RELEASE HIM. YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING  ABOUT WHERE...OR BEING NICE. I CAMPED HERE LAST NIGHT. THESE ARE FRESH. THE PANTHER SPENT  SOME TIME HERE. IT WENT THAT WAY NOT LONG AGO. BREAK CAMP.  YOU'RE NOT SAFE HERE. IT'S SAFE ENOUGH. YOU'RE HERE. LET'S REST FOR A MOMENT. THERE'S NO  TIME TO REST. IARA WON'T LET TAO GO  UNTIL I FIND THIS ANIMAL. YOU HAVE TO EAT. WE BOTH DO. AHEM. SO THAT'S HOW IT IS. YOU ONLY GET CLOSE WHEN  THE NIGHT'S COLD AND THE FIRE'S BURNING LOW. ACTUALLY, IT WAS THE OTHER WAY AROUND. REMEMBER? LOOK...RIGHT NOW I HAVE TO THINK  ABOUT TAO AND THE PANTHER. I KNOW, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP. YOU STAY HERE AND BREAK CAMP. I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE TRACKS. [ FOOTSTEPS ] ARINA. ORPHEO? IT FEELS SO GOOD TO HOLD YOU. I'VE DREAMT OF THIS MOMENT  FOR SO LONG. MMM. HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? SHHH. I'VE MISSED YOU EVERY  MOMENT WE'VE BEEN APART. MMM...AND I YOU. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ORPHEO, I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. WHY WON'T YOU ANSWER ME? RUH, AH, AM I HAPPY TO SEE YOU. YES, YES, I'M FOLLOWING,  I'M FOLLOWING. I HOPE YOU'RE TAKING ME TO DAR. I GOT A STORY TO TELL HIM. DID YOU FIND THE PANTHER? IT'S NOT LIKE ANY PANTHER  I'VE ENCOUNTERED BEFORE. IS TAO ALL RIGHT? I'VE ALREADY  LET HIM GO. WHERE IS HE? HE DROPPED IN ON A FEW  FRIENDS OF MINE. I'M SURE HE'LL CATCH UP  WITH YOU SOON. WHERE'S THE PANTHER NOW? YOU MUST KNOW MORE  THAN YOU'RE TELLING ME. THE PANTHER'S NOT  YOUR REAL ENEMY. YOUR REAL ENEMY IS WITH  YOUR FRIEND, ARINA, RIGHT NOW. ARINA'S IN DANGER? YOU FEAR FOR HER; MEANING YOU CARE FOR HER. YOU CHOOSE YOUR FRIENDS  TOO QUICKLY, DAR, AND YOU KNOW YOUR  ENEMIES TOO LATE. IF ARINA'S IN DANGER,  I HAVE TO HELP HER. SHE MAY NOT WANT YOUR HELP. THIS ENEMY IS  NOT WHAT IT SEEMS. DAR, YOU WOULDN'T  BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TO ME. IF IT WASN'T FOR RUH, I WOULDN'T HAVE  FOUND MY WAY BACK. HE'S SMART ENOUGH TO STAY  AWAY WHEN MAGIC'S INVOLVED. WHAT KIND OF MAGIC? HER. HELLO? ARINA'S IN DANGER.  WE HAVE TO HURRY. ARINA? BUT... YOU'LL REGRET THIS, DAR. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING  YOU CAN FIGHT. ORPHEO, THIS CAN'T BE REAL. I WATCHED YOU DIE. IS THIS NOT A  BEATING HEART? DO YOU NOT FEEL BLOOD RUSHING THROUGH MY VEINS? I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH. YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW  OFTEN I LAY AWAKE PRAYING FOR YOU TO BE HERE. THEN OUR PRAYERS  HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. IT'S AS IF YOU'VE  NEVER BEEN AWAY. SHHH... JUST LET ME FEEL YOU AGAINST ME. MMM... I LOVE YOU, ORPHEO. AND I LOVE YOU...MORE THAN EVER. AND I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU HOME. SUDDENLY, I WASN'T  IN THE CAVE ANY MORE, I WAS IN THE MIDDLE  OF THIS PIT OF SNAKES. SNAKES EVEN YOU  COULDN'T HAVE REASONED WITH. THEN I HEARD A ROAR;  I THOUGHT IARA HAD SENT SOME NEW HELL AFTER ME. I PICKED THIS UP  TO DEFEND MYSELF. WHAT IS IT? THORN OF THE MOUNTAIN --  MY UNCLE SAYS IT HAS THE POWER  TO SLAY EVIL SPIRITS. I THOUGHT YOU SAID  YOU WEREN'T SUPERSTITIOUS. I'M NOT, BUT THEY SAY THAT  BAD THINGS HAPPEN IN THREES. SO FAR, I'VE BEEN TRAPPED  UNDER A POND, AND THROWN INTO A PIT OF SNAKES. AND ON DAYS LIKE TODAY,  EVEN THE MOST RATIONAL MAN STARTS GRASPING  AT STRAWS OR THIS. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? THAT LAST DAY  WE WERE TOGETHER... IN THE FINAL BATTLE  WITH THE TERRONS. I SAW YOU FALL. YES, THE TERRONS THOUGHT  I WAS DEAD TOO, LIKE ALL OF US. LIKE ALL OF US? YOU THOUGHT I WAS DEAD? AND I KNEW I COULDN'T LIVE  WITHOUT YOU. I LOOKED FOR YOU EVERYWHERE. I NEVER STOPPED  LOVING YOU, ARINA. THOSE FEELINGS  SURVIVE EVERYTHING, EVEN DEATH. LOSING YOU BROUGHT ME THE GREATEST PAIN IN MY LIFE. BUT YOU'VE BEEN WITH OTHERS. THE MAN YOU CAME HERE WITH... I SAW HOW YOU  LOOKED AT HIM. DO YOU KNOW HOW I FELT  WHEN I THOUGHT... -YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN WITH HIM?  -I THOUGHT YOU DIED. I WASN'T IMPORTANT TO YOU  AS YOU ARE TO ME? ORPHEO, I WILL NEVER LOVE ANOTHER MAN THE WAY I LOVED YOU. "LOVED." THE WAY I LOVE YOU. IS HE IMPORTANT TO YOU? ONLY BECAUSE I HUNT HIM. YOU FOUND NEW WAYS TO HUNT. I ONLY LET HIM  WALK AWAY FOR NOW. I'LL FIND HIM WHEN I NEED HIM. YOU WON'T NEED HIM. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE BUT US NOW. AND I'VE COME TO TAKE YOU HOME. A NEW HOME, WHERE YOU AND  I WILL LIVE TOGETHER FOREVER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THERE'S NO TIME. THE DAY'S ALREADY  STARTED TO DIE. I KNOW YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS. AND I'LL ANSWER THEM ALL. BUT IF OUR LOVE MEANS  ANYTHING TO YOU, WE MUST GO NOW. [ TAO ]: DAR, YOU STILL HAVEN'T  TOLD ME WHY WE'RE DOING THIS. WHY DO WE CARE  WHAT HAPPENS TO ARINA? WHAT HAS SHE EVER  TRIED TO DO FOR US EXCEPT TRY TO GET US KILLED? TAO, SHE'S A  HUMAN BEING THE BLACK PANTHER DISAPPEARED.  MAYBE SHE'S NOT IN DANGER. BUT SHE IS --  AND IARA SAYS THE DANGER'S WITH  HER RIGHT NOW. GREAT, WE'LL HELP  SOMEONE WE DON'T LIKE BASED ON THE WORD OF SOMEONE  WHO NEVER TELLS US THE TRUTH. YOU DON'T KNOW THE EVIL  I FELT WHEN I LOOKED INTO  THAT PANTHER'S EYES. WAS IT A KIND OF SORCERY? I DON'T KNOW, BUT IT MADE ME  FRIGHTENED FOR ARINA. YOU KNOW, I'VE HEARD  STORIES LIKE THIS BEFORE. BLACK CATS THAT TRAVEL  WITH SPIRITS FROM THE WORLD BENEATH THE WORLD. THEY'RE CALLED FAMILIARS. AN EVIL SERVANT FROM AN EVIL  SPIRIT FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE. IS THIS ONE OF YOUR "DAY OF CHANGE" EVIL SPIRIT STORIES? THEY RETURN TO THE WORLD  OF THE LIVING ON A MISSION. I DON'T KNOW, BUT APPARENTLY  IT HAS MORE TO DO WITH ARINA THAN IT DOES WITH US. THIS IS WHY THE PANTHER OR IT WAS SENT TO DISTRACT ME SO ITS MASTER COULD GET TO HER. NO, DAR, IT DOESN'T CONCERN US. APPARENTLY IT DOES. -WHERE ARE WE GOING?  -NOT FAR. -WILL WE NEED FOOD OR WATER?  -NO! AND WHEN WE GET THERE, YOU WON'T  WANT FOR FOOD OR DRINK AGAIN. ORPHEO, SOMETHING... I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS. TELL ME SOMETHING. WHAT COULD BE  BETTER THAN FOR US TO BE TOGETHER? LOOK, FROM NOW ON, I WILL NEVER  LEAVE YOUR SIDE. IF YOU COULD JUST TELL ME WHY WE HAVE TO DO THIS TODAY... ORPHEO, I WOULD GO TO THE ENDS  OF THE WORLD WITH YOU. BUT IT'S BEEN SO LONG,  AND THERE ARE THINGS HERE THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND. EVERYTHING WILL BE EXPLAINED. ARINA! YOU...GET AWAY FROM HER. DAR, THIS IS ORPHEO,  THE MAN THAT I LOVED, THAT I -THOUGHT WAS DEAD.  -YOU'RE SURE HE'S NOT DEAD? WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS. THE SUN IS ALREADY LOW  IN THE SKY. WE MUST GO. YOU TRAVEL WITH  A BLACK PANTHER, ORPHEO? I SAID... GET AWAY FROM HER. ARRRGHHH! YOU WILL NOT TOUCH HER AGAIN. YOU'RE NOT TAKING HER AWAY. GET OUT OF MY WAY. WHAT ARE YOU? ORPHEO, NO! YOU ARE UNWISE  TO COME BETWEEN ORPHEO AND WHAT IS MOST PRECIOUS TO HIM. NO, NO. SPARE HIS LIFE  AND I WILL COME WITH YOU. ARRRGHHH! WHY DID YOU DO THAT? I TOLD YOU  I WOULD COME. I WANT HIM TO REMEMBER  THE MAN YOU CHOSE TO BE WITH. THE SUN IS SINKING; WE MUST GO. SHE'S GOING. GOOD...AND  GOOD RIDDANCE. IT ISN'T OVER YET. WHERE'S HE TAKING HER? TO THE WORLD BENEATH THE WORLD. BEFORE SUNSET  IF HE CAN, OTHERWISE... BUT HE'S DEAD ALREADY. WHAT MORE CAN HAPPEN TO HIM? THERE ARE MANY FATES  FAR WORSE THAN DEATH. WHY, EVEN YOU KNOW THAT. HMM. BUT SHE'S NOT DEAD. AND THAT'S THE  ONLY WAY YOU CAN ENTER THE WORLD  BENEATH THE WORLD. I'LL BE QUITE FASCINATED  TO SEE HOW ARINA COPES WHEN SHE FINDS OUT  THE ARRANGEMENT SHE'S MADE. [ LAUGHING ] HOW MANY FINGERS? THREE. GOOD. GONE. MAYBE YOU  SHOULD REST A WHILE. NO. DAR, I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST-- NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT. NEXT TIME HE WILL KILL YOU. THANKS FOR THE VOTE  OF CONFIDENCE. LOOK, I PREFER MY FRIENDS ALIVE. AND WHILE YOU ARE ALIVE,  I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN FIGHT  SOMEONE WHO'S DEAD. I'LL HAVE TO TRY, WON'T I? TAO, HOW DOES  A DEAD MAN DO THIS? FOR THE TIME HE'S  HERE, HE HAS POWERS. LOOK, GIVE THIS UP.  YOU CAN'T SAVE HER. ORPHEO IS  A CREATURE OF THE DEAD. HE DOESN'T LEAVE  ANY FOOTPRINTS, AND HE HAS THE STRENGTH OF A DEMON. EVEN DEMONS HAVE  THEIR WEAKNESSES. LOOK, I'VE HEARD OF LOVES SO POWERFUL THEY COMPEL  THE LOVER TO RETURN FROM THE WORLD BENEATH THE WORLD IN ORDER TO FIND THEIR BELOVED. IF THESE TWO HAVE MET  IN THIS WORLD, THEN THE PULL  FROM THE OTHER SIDE COULD BE IRRESISTIBLE. HE'S TAKEN HER WITH HER? PART OF HER WANTS TO GO. PART WANTS TO CLING TO LIFE. SHE ONLY AGREED TO GO  IF HE SPARED YOUR LIFE. NO, IF HE LOVES HER,  WHY WOULD HE WANT TO KILL HER? 'CAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY  THEY CAN BE TOGETHER. THE LEGEND SAYS THAT SHE  MUST GO WILLINGLY. HE MUST GET HER BACK  BEFORE THE SUN SETS. WE'D BETTER HURRY. COME ON, THEY'RE FAR AHEAD. ORPHEO, WE MUST REST. THERE'S NO TIME. PLEASE. YOU  LOOK SO TIRED. I AM TIRED...BUT WE MUST GO ON. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I TRAVELLED FAR. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. HOW MUCH FURTHER? THE TUNNEL OF TREES... THEN WE'RE HOME. I KNOW THOSE TREES. THERE'S NOTHING  BEYOND THEM BUT WASTELAND. ONCE WE GET THERE,  EVERYTHING WILL BE EXPLAINED. ONCE I'M WHERE? THE WORLD BENEATH THE WORLD. NO. YOU AGREED TO COME. I SPARED HIS LIFE FOR YOU. THERE'S ONE MORE LIFE  I WISH I COULD SPARE. YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD ME  WHAT ORPHEO WANTS WITH HER. HER SOUL...GIVEN OF HER OWN  CHOICE AND BY HER OWN HAND. A DARK LOVE IS A SELFISH  AND TERRIBLE THING. I TOLD YOU THERE  WAS MORE TO THIS. BUT YOU COULD MAKE IT HAPPEN. I CAN'T CHANGE FATE-- OH, BUT I THOUGHT  YOU COULD DO ANYTHING. WELL, I DO START THINGS. THEN I LEAVE IT  UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL. I MUST SAY, I RATHER ENJOY  THE LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY. UNFORTUNATELY, HUMANS ALWAYS  TEND TO MUDDY THINGS UP WITH THIS CONFUSING BUSINESS  THEY CALL LOVE. OF COURSE, THAT WOULDN'T  AFFECT YOU, WOULD IT, MY DEAR? STUPID. IF WE ARE TO BE TOGETHER,  THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE. YOU WANT ME TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE? ORPHEO, NO. IT IS  THE ONLY WAY. IT MOCKS EVERY NAMIB  WHO DIED WITH HONOUR. -THERE ARE NO MORE NAMIB.  -THERE IS ONE! ARINA... DEATH IS AN ILLUSION. MY SOUL IS NOT DEAD. THERE IS BEAUTY  IN THE ETERNITY OF DEATH. YOU AND I WILL NEVER GROW OLD. ARINA, PLEASE, YOU MUST DECIDE. MY STRENGTH EBBS WITH THE SUN. IF YOU DON'T DO THIS SOON,  YOU WILL HAVE GAINED NOTHING BUT A SHADOW OF WHAT I AM. TAKE CARE OF THEM. WHAT DOES IT WANT? ORPHEO SENT IT TO KEEP US AWAY. THERE'S NO OTHER CHOICE.  THORN OF THE MOUNTAIN. -I'D RATHER TRUST MY STAFF.  -NO, DAR. TRUST THIS,  THIS IS NOT AN ANIMAL. NO-O-O-O! [ GROANING ] THEY JUST KILLED MY PANTHER. TAO, COME ON. WE CAN STILL CATCH THEM. I HAVE SUFFERED  THE FIRES OF HELL... BECAUSE OF MY LOVE FOR YOU. IF YOU WON'T COME WILLINGLY  TO EASE MY PAIN... I LOVED YOU AS NO WOMAN  HAS EVER LOVED ANY MAN... BUT I DON'T BELONG  IN YOUR WORLD ANY MORE I'M IN THAT WORLD  BECAUSE OF MY LOVE FOR YOU! AFTER THAT FINAL BATTLE, WHEN ALL I COULD SEE  WERE THE DEAD... I KNEW I COULDN'T  LIVE WITHOUT YOU. YOU TOOK YOUR OWN LIFE. I COMMITTED  THE GRAVEST SIN TO OFFER UP MY SOUL  TO BE WITH YOU. BUT ALL I GOT WAS TORMENT  BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT THERE. YOU CAN EASE MY PAIN. WE WILL BE TOGETHER FOREVER. MY LOVE FOR YOU HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONGER THAN DEATH, ARINA. I CAN'T DO THIS, ORPHEO. [ SHOUTING ] I WON'T LEAVE YOU  HERE TO LOVE ANOTHER. EITHER WAY, YOU DIE. HE'S TAKING HER WITH HIM,  BUT SHE'S RESISTING. UNLESS ARINA DIES BY HER OWN  HAND, THEY CAN'T BE TOGETHER. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DIE,  BUT HE'LL TAKE HER ANYWAY. WE'RE ON TIME...  WE MUST HURRY, ARINA. THE BEASTMASTER'S COMING. NOW... TO CLOUD YOUR THOUGHTS,  BUT YOUR PLACE IS WITH ME. ORPHEO, PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS. ORPHEO, NO! ORPHEO, DON'T DO THIS. LOOK AT ME. REMEMBER HOW  IT WAS WITH US...BEFORE. YOU ALWAYS TRIED  TO PROTECT ME... EVEN WHEN IT MEANT PUTTING YOUR OWN LIFE IN DANGER. YOU MUST STILL FEEL  THAT SAME WAY, OTHERWISE, YOU  WOULDN'T HAVE COME FOR ME. ARINA. DAR. YOU PREFER THE LOVE OF ANOTHER. NO, ORPHEO. NO LOVE COULD BE  AS IT WAS FOR US. [ SHOUTING ] ORPHEO, DON'T DO THIS. ARINA. NO, ORPHEO. OUR TIME IS PAST. AS GREAT AS OUR LOVE WAS, IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE. FATE DEEMED THAT  IT SHOULD END... SO IT WOULD NEVER DIE. DON'T LET ME SPEND ETERNITY  REMEMBERING YOU LIKE THIS. I WILL WAIT FOR YOU. I HAVE TO TALK TO ARINA. GO WITH TAO. HE'LL FIND YOU SOMETHING TO EAT. HE WAS A GOOD MAN ONCE. AND WE TRULY DID  LOVE EACH OTHER. I DON'T THINK THAT LOVE LIKE THAT EVER DIES, EVEN IF THOSE  WHO SHARE IT DO. YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO  THANK YOU FOR SOMETHING. YOU OFFERED YOUR LIFE  FOR MINE BEFORE. I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT. DEBT'S BEEN PAID. WE'RE EVEN. AND THERE IS ONE MORE THING. YOU PROMISED TO TELL ME  WHY YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ME. DID I SAY THAT? YEAH, YOU DID. HMPH. ANOTHER TIME. CLEVER GIRL. WHY DID SHE LET HIM GO AGAIN? SHE'S HUNTING HIM, ISN'T SHE? OH, AFTER A FASHION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. OF COURSE YOU DON'T. HUMANS AREN'T LIKE US  IN LIFE OR DEATH. BUT SOMETIMES, IN LOVE,  THERE'S A CERTAIN GRACE I, MYSELF, TAKE MORE PRIDE  IN THE ART OF MANIPULATION AND HAVE GREAT RESPECT  FOR THOSE WHO PRACTICE IT. ISN'T IT TIME YOU  GOT BACK TO YOUR SWAMP? I LIKE IT HERE. AND I DON'T TRUST THAT WOMAN. SHE'S GOT PLANS  FOR MY BEASTMASTER. YOUR BEASTMASTER? THEN PERHAPS YOU  SHOULD TRY A FRESH APPROACH. OH... ONE THAT MIGHT INVOLVE THE POWER OF LETTING GO. CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? ASK AWAY. THAT STORY YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE THORN OF  THE MOUNTAIN, WAS IT TRUE? TAO, YOU'RE A MAN OF REASON,  AND NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME YOU ENTRUST OUR LIVES  WITH SUPERSTITION? YOU DIDN'T FIND IT STRANGE  THAT THE THORN WAS REAL, BUT IT WAS MEANT TO DEAL  WITH A CREATURE THAT NEVER REALLY EXISTED? I TRAVEL WITH A MAN WHO TALKS WITH ANIMALS. I'VE SEEN WIZARDS  AND DEMONS, AND... I'VE JUST COME  TO ACCEPT THAT THERE ARE MANY  THINGS BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH  THAT NO MAN CAN EVER UNDERSTAND. YOU NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME.
