  [ LAUGHING ] IF I WERE YOU,  I WOULD HAVE DONE MORE THAN A LITTLE  KISSING BY NOW. THE WEDDING'S  IN JUST A FEW DAYS. I'M SURE KARPEN  WON'T BACK AWAY FROM YOU. KARPEN'S NOT  REALLY HIMSELF LATELY, SINCE THESE TROUBLES STARTED --  HE'S GOT A LOT ON HIS MIND. I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE  HIM WANT TO GET CLOSER TO YOU. MAYBE HE FEELS THAT WAY INSIDE. YEAH. I'M SURE HE DOES.

 [ STRANGE NOISE ] WHAT WAS THAT? DO YOU THINK-- NO. NOT IN DAYLIGHT. THEY NEVER COME IN THE DAYLIGHT. [ LAUGHING ] WE WERE WORRIED --  AFTER ALL, WE'RE WITH YOU. SOME PEOPLE SAY YOU'RE SAFE FROM THE ATTACKS BECAUSE KARPEN  IS THE SPIRIT HEALER. I'M GOING IN. YOU COMING? SO YOU SEE, THE IDEA IS YOU CAN'T SWIM  IN THE SAME RIVER TWICE.

 WHY NOT? I DO  IT ALL THE TIME. NOT EXACTLY. YOU SEE, THE RIVER ISN'T THE SAME RIVER. THE RIVER HAS CHANGED.  EVERYTHING CHANGES. NOTHING STAYS THE SAME. OH, SO THAT'S  WHY YOU KEEP GETTING LOST --  EVEN THOUGH YOU VERY CLEVER -- WHAT I'M TALKING  ABOUT IS A NEW WAY TO LOOK AT AND TO UNDERSTAND  THE WORLD -- SEE, YOU CAN TAKE A STEP IN THE RIVER TODAY-- AND WE'RE GOING TO. RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHING ] THIS IS EXCELLENT --  THIS MEANS I CAN SHOW YOU EXACTLY WHAT  I WAS TALKING ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENED? LOOKS LIKE IT WAS KILLED  BY ANOTHER CROCODILE. STRANGE. ANIMALS DON'T  USUALLY KILL THEIR OWN KIND. NO. ONLY HUMANS DO THAT. MARIKA! HELP! MARIKA! MARIKA! MARIKA! HELP. [ GASPING ] -HURRY, HURRY.  -DAR, HURRY, HURRY, MOVE. COME ON, DAR. COME ON. HURRY UP. -DAR, DAR.  -THAT'S IT. DAR. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... HOW IS SHE? I DON'T LIKE  THE LOOK OF THIS WOUND. WHAT DID THAT  CROCODILE HAVE TO SAY? IT WOULDN'T TALK  TO ME -- HOW FAR -IS YOUR VILLAGE?  -JUST UP RIVER. WILL SHE DIE? NOT IF MY FRIEND  CAN HELP IT. I'LL NEED A BOWL OF WATER AND  A CLEAN CLOTH FOR A POULTICE. HE'S THE BEASTMASTER. BEASTMASTER! ARE YOU THE BEASTMASTER? YES. MAYBE THE FATES SENT YOU  TO HELP US STOP THE ATTACKS. WHAT, THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS? UP UNTIL NOW, ONLY AT NIGHT. BUT IF THEY START ATTACKING  US IN THE DAYLIGHT, TOO, SOON THERE WON'T  BE ANY OF US LEFT. DAR. HAVE YOU HEARD OF POISONOUS -CROCODILES?  -POISON? THE WOUND HAS A VENOM IN IT. OH. THE BITE MARKS ARE DIFFERENT. I DON'T KNOW ANY ANIMAL  THAT LEAVES A WOUND LIKE THIS. THAT CROCODILE I FOUGHT  DIDN'T ATTACK THIS GIRL. MUST HAVE BEEN  SOMETHING ELSE IN THE WATER. WHAT? I DON'T KNOW. WILL SHE MAKE IT? WELL, SHE'S STRONG.  SHE'S FIGHTING IT. MAYBE WHEN SHE COMES AROUND  SHE CAN TELL US SOMETHING. THE GODS ARE AGAINST US. HOW MANY MORE  YOUNG WOMEN? DO WE HAVE TO LOSE? IT HAD TO BE  ONE OF THE PHANTOMS. THE PHANTOM CROCODILES --  THEY COME AT NIGHT AND STEAL OUR YOUNG WOMEN. NOBODY SEES THEM --  NOBODY WHO LIVES TO TELL ABOUT IT. WHAT WAS DONE TO STOP THEM? OUR BEST YOUNG MEN GO OUT AT NIGHT AND STAND GUARD, BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM  TO STOP THE ATTACKS. CAN YOU HELP US? ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING BACK DOWN TO THE RIVER TO FIND OUT WHY THE  CROCODILES WOULDN'T TALK. I'M SURE IT HAS SOMETHING TO  DO WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. I'LL DO WHAT I CAN. WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HER? I'M TRYING TO DRAW  POISON. SHE NEEDS-- DON'T TELL ME  WHAT SHE NEEDS. IF SHE NEEDS  HEALING, I'LL DO IT. BY STOPPING VENOM  FROM SEIZING HER HEART, SHE'LL PROBABLY  LIVE -- SHE'S STRONG. -DID YOU SEE WHAT ATTACKED HER?  -NO. DAR PULLED HER  FROM THE RIVER AND WHATEVER -IT WAS DIDN'T SURFACE.  -IT WAS THE PHANTOMS. I KNOW HOW TO TREAT HER. YOU CAN LEAVE. SHE NEEDS INCANTATIONS TO HEAL HER SPIRIT. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST  SPIRITUAL HEALING, BUT THIS POULTICE IS  DRAWING OUT THE POISON, SO WHY BOTHER YOUR GODS? I SAID, GET OUT! KARPEN! HE IS THE BEASTMASTER'S FRIEND. HE IS HERE TO HELP US. WE DON'T NEED HIS HELP. WELL, WE NEED THE BEASTMASTER'S. THERE'S NOTHING  HE CAN DO EITHER. WELL, LET'S  HOPE YOU'RE WRONG. BECAUSE YOU AND  THE OTHERS HAVEN'T THE GODS ARE ANGRY WITH US --  CREATURES ARE ATTACKING BECAUSE WE WON'T  SHOW THEM RESPECT. WE'RE NOT GOING  BACK TO THE OLD WAYS. WHERE'S THE BEASTMASTER NOW? TRYING TO HELP YOU. JUST LIKE I AM. THEY ARE BETROTHED. KARPEN IS OUR SPIRIT HEALER. HE AND MARIKA WERE TO  BE MARRIED UNDER THE NEW MOON THREE DAYS FROM NOW. WHO ARE THESE GODS HE'S TALKING  ABOUT AND WHY ARE THEY ANGRY? OUR PEOPLE ONCE WORSHIPPED  THE CROCODILE GOD. KARPEN IS TOO YOUNG  TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS BAD AS THINGS  ARE NOW, THOSE... ...THOSE DAYS  WERE FAR, FAR WORSE. I KNOW THAT WHAT  I AM DOING CAN HELP HER. LET HIM DO HIS WORK, KARPEN. GO! IF SHE DIES... YOU DIE. KARPEN! ANYTHING TO DRIVE  THESE PEOPLE AWAY. THE BEASTMASTER AND HIS  FRIEND HAVE COME TO HELP US. IT COULD BE A  SIGN FROM GODS LET'S SEE IF THEY  DO ANYTHING FIRST. THEN GIVE THEM A CHANCE. NOTHING WE'VE TRIED  HAS STOPPED THE ATTACKS. YOU KNOW HOW TO STOP THEM -- AND SO DO I. THE OLD WAYS WERE WRONG. THEN WHY DO SO MANY OF US DIE? SURPRISED? BUT YOU'RE GLAD TO SEE ME. AS ALWAYS. WHAT'S A GIRL GOT TO DO TO KEEP YOU FOCUSED ON HER CHARMS? JUST BE YOURSELF. WHAT ARE YOU  DOING HERE, IARA? THIS IS MY DOMAIN. SOMETHING'S STALKING THE  FISHING VILLAGE UP THE RIVER. WHEN DEATH COMES STALKING,  I ALWAYS LOOK WHAT THE HUMANS ARE DOING FIRST. MAYBE YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME. EVERY TORCH MUST BE LIT. MORE TORCHES HERE. MORE TORCHES HERE. KARPEN AND THE OTHER  YOUNG MEN DO THIS EVERY NIGHT. BUT EVERY NIGHT, SOMEBODY'S  STILL TAKEN FROM THE VILLAGE AND THEY COME BACK EMPTY-HANDED. WHERE'S YOUR FRIEND,  THE BEASTMASTER? I THOUGHT HE WAS  GOING TO HELP US. HE WILL. NOW YOU'LL SEE WHAT HORRORS THE NIGHT BRINGS. WHEN YOU LOOK INTO MY EYES,  WHAT DO YOU SEE, HMM? IF YOU WERE HONEST,  YOU'D KNOW IT'S WHAT YOU SEE WHEN YOU LOOK  INTO YOUR OWN HEART. LEAVE ME ALONE -- THERE'S  SOMETHING I'VE GOT TO DO. YOU'RE GOING TO STAY  OUT HERE ALL NIGHT? IF I HAVE TO. THERE'S NOTHING  YOU CAN DO TO HELP THEM, DAR. DON'T EVEN TRY. WHO ARE YOU? TAO. IS IT NIGHT? -YES.  -PUT OUT THE TORCHES. -NO ONE CAN KNOW WE'RE IN HERE.  -WE'RE SAFE. WE'RE SAFE. NOBODY CAN GET IN. NO ONE IS SAFE. [ TWIG SNAPPING ] [ WAILING ] NO! DON'T GO OUT THERE. [ SCREAMING ] [ SCREAMING ] TWO YOUNG WOMEN WERE TAKEN. START SEARCHING EVERYWHERE. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? DID THEY TAKE  MARIKA TOO? NO. NO. MAYBE KARPEN  WAS RIGHT. MAYBE THE GODS  ARE ANGRY WITH US. -WHICH WAY DID THEY GO?  -THEY VANISHED. LIKE ALWAYS. KARPEN. THEY'VE BEEN HERE. THEY ALWAYS SEEM TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE LYING IN WAIT  AND ATTACK ELSEWHERE. -HOW MANY WERE TAKEN?  -TWO. MARIKA IS SAFE. WHERE WERE YOU? WHAT DID  YOU DO TO HELP? OBVIOUSLY NOT ENOUGH --  BUT I THINK WE CAN GO -AFTER THEM -- TOGETHER, WE--  -TOGETHER WE CAN WHAT? SEARCH FOR THE SCENT OF A GHOST? -THEY LEAVE NO TRAIL.  -THE WOMEN COULD LEAVE TRACKS. THERE'S NEVER ANY  TRACE OF ANYONE TAKEN. BUT YOU'RE THE BEASTMASTER. YOU CAN ASK THE OWLS  IF THEY SAW ANYTHING. KARPEN! LISTEN. THE BEASTMASTER IS OUR FRIEND. THEY LOOKED LIKE CROCODILES.  ALL TEETH AND CLAWS. EXCEPT THEY WALKED  ON HIND LEGS, CARRYING WOMEN OFF ON THEIR  BACKS, NOT THEIR MOUTHS. WE KNOW THEY'RE  NOT CROCODILES. NOT FROM THE  NATURAL WORLD, ANYWAY. WHERE ARE THEY TAKING  THE VICTIMS, AND WHY? THE VILLAGE WORSHIPS  A CROCODILE GOD -- KARPEN SAYS HE'S ANGRY BECAUSE  THERE ARE NO SACRIFICES. PHANTOMS...IARA. NOW CROCODILE GODS. -IARA?  -YEAH. WHAT DOES SHE SAY ABOUT THIS? WELL, NOTHING HELPFUL. HOW'S THE GIRL? HAS SHE TOLD  YOU ANYTHING? NO. SHE COULD GO EITHER WAY. KARPEN'S NOT HAPPY  I'M TREATING HER. I DON'T THINK THERE'S  MUCH HE'S HAPPY ABOUT. JUST... TRY AND STAY OUT OF HIS WAY. HOW DO WE KNOW HE'S NOT  HELPING OUR ATTACKERS? BECAUSE THE BEASTMASTER  IS A MAN OF HONOUR. -WE ALL KNOW HE'S HALF ANIMAL.  -YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU SAY. MY BRIDE WAS ATTACKED. THE PHANTOMS ATTACK,  HE HAPPENS TO ARRIVE LATE. WE WERE ATTACKED BEFORE  HE CAME TO THE VILLAGE. THEN MAYBE HE'S TAKEN THE CREATURE'S SIDE AGAINST US. I'VE BEEN A SPIRIT HEALER TOO LONG TO BELIEVE HE JUST  HAPPENED TO COME HERE. [ RUSTLING ] AND IF THE BEASTMASTER'S  NOT UP TO SOMETHING... WHY IS HIS FRIEND SPYING ON US? I'M NOT SPYING  ON ANYONE. PUT THIS WEASEL  IN THE PRISON HUT. WE'RE GOING TO HUNT HIS FRIEND. -THAT'S A BAD IDEA.  -I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. I'M DOING IT FOR  THE VILLAGE'S GOOD. YOU'RE MAKING  A MISTAKE. DAR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE  FOR ANY OF THIS. EVERYTHING'S GOING  TO BE ALL RIGHT. I PROMISE -- IF THEY'D  ONLY LISTENED TO ME, NONE OF THIS  WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. THE GODS DON'T WANT  YOU TO DIE, MARIKA -- THEY JUST WANT US TO SHOW THEM THE RESPECT THEY DEMAND. PLEASE... KEEP FIGHTING. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU. KARPEN, HURRY -- WE'LL LOSE HIM. WE KNOW THIS JUNGLE BETTER THAN ANYONE -- WE'LL HAVE HIM BEFORE HE EVEN SEES US. LET'S GO. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE  THE HERB POULTICE OR MARIKA WILL DIE. YOU CAN'T  LET HER DIE. [ ROARING ] NICE WORK. WHAT GAME ARE  YOU PLAYING, IARA? DON'T YOU THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE VERY PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO HELP  ARE HUNTING YOU DOWN? WHY DO YOU CONTINUE TO INSIST  THAT HUMANS ARE WORTH HELPING? MAYBE BECAUSE  I'M HUMAN. I CAN HELP YOU GET OVER THAT  LITTLE PROBLEM QUICK ENOUGH. TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE  THIS PARADISE AGAIN. MAYBE LATER. I HAVE SOME WORK I HAVE TO DO. LOOKING FOR  THE YOUNG WOMEN? -WHERE ARE THEY?  -YOU WON'T FIND THEM. NOBODY EVER WILL. BECAUSE THEY WERE  SACRIFICED TO A CROCODILE. VERY GOOD. A ONE-EYED CROCODILE, ACTUALLY. WHERE WILL I FIND HIM? NOT FAR.  DOWN RIVER. WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY  BEING SO HELPFUL? YOU MIGHT LEARN SOMETHING  FROM HIM. HE'S LIKE ME. HE DOESN'T HAVE  A LOT OF RESPECT FOR HUMANS. HE'S A BETTER  SACRIFICE IF HE'S ALIVE. GUARDS. WHERE WERE YOU? THIS WILL HELP, BUT I NEED  TO FIND SOME STRONGER HERBS. NO, DON'T GO... PLEASE. I NEED THE STRONGER HERBS  TO COMBAT THE POISON. I THOUGHT IT WAS VENOM,  BUT IF IT WAS... I'VE SEEN THE SYMPTOMS BEFORE  IN SLEEPING POTIONS. -CALANGA.  -WHAT?  -IT'S A POTION MY PEOPLE ONCE USED  TO MAKE THE CROCODILES SLEEP WHILE WE FISHED. -IS THERE AN ANTIDOTE?  -MM-HMM. THE WEEPING BLOSSOM. IT GROWS DOWN BY THE RIVERBANK. I'M, I'M GOING TO  FIND THIS HERB. JUST IF...IF DAR ARRIVES, JUST TELL HIM, TELL HIM  HE'S IN DANGER. FROM WHO? KARPEN. HE'S A GOOD MAN. I DON'T KNOW WHY HE'D HURT US.  WE WANT TO HELP. THE WHOLE VILLAGE IS FRIGHTENED. HE'S OUR SPIRIT HEALER,  BUT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO. I'M GOING TO FIND THIS HERB. I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN. WEEPING BLOSSOM. IMPRESSIVE. VERY IMPRESSIVE. THAT OLD CROCODILE LIKES YOU, AND HE DOESN'T LIKE VERY MUCH. WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY  THEY WERE STARVING? YOU DIDN'T ASK. SOME OF THEM ARE SO HUNGRY THEY'RE EATING EACH OTHER;  IT SHAMES THEM. THAT'S WHY THE ONE I THOUGHT ATTACKED MARIKA  WOULDN'T TALK TO ME. HE'S ASHAMED FOR WHAT  HE MUST DO TO SURVIVE. AT LEAST HE SURVIVED. HOW CAN FISH JUST  DISAPPEAR FROM A RIVER, IARA? IF THAT OLD CROCODILE  CAN'T TELL YOU, WHAT MAKES -YOU THINK I CAN?  -HE'S JUST A CROCODILE. HE'S CONCERNED WITH THINGS  THAT AFFECT CROCODILES. YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH EVERYTHING  THAT AFFECTS YOUR DOMAIN. THAT'S VERY FLATTERING. THERE'S SOMETHING  YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME. I'M A WOMAN. I'M ALLOWED  TO KEEP A FEW SECRETS. AND THERE ARE SOME THINGS WITH  WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T INTERFERE. WALK AWAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S  A BALANCE IN NATURE. I'D SAY THEY LOOK PRETTY HUNGRY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? OH, DON'T TRY AND TALK TO THEM. I TOLD THEM NOT TO. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? IF YOU PROMISE TO FORGET  ABOUT THE VILLAGE AND LEAVE, THEY'LL LEAVE TOO. YOU'D LET YOUR CREATURES EAT ME? IF THAT'S WHAT  IT TAKES TO STOP YOU FROM INTERFERING, THEN, YES. JUST LEAVE, DAR.  THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO. TAO? YOU'RE LOOKING SO MUCH BETTER. THANKS TO YOU  AND YOUR FRIEND. WHERE IS HE? HERE. I FOUND THE PHANTOMS. ONLY THEY'RE NOT PHANTOMS,  THEY'RE MEN. BUT THEY LEAVE NO TRAIL. THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE  LOOKING FOR CROCODILE TRACKS. YOU SEE, WHAT'S HAPPENING  IS THEY'RE COMING INTO THE VILLAGE AT NIGHT,  BUT THEIR FOOTPRINTS ARE BLENDING IN  WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE'S HERE. KARPEN WILL  BE RELIEVED. HE DIDN'T CATCH UP  WITH YOU, DID HE? HE TRIED. WE HAVE TO FORTIFY  THE VILLAGE BEFORE NIGHTFALL. YOU HAVE TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH MEN. AND IF WE WORK TOGETHER  AND WE PREPARE FOR THIS, WE WILL BEAT THEM. I TOLD KARPEN YOU WERE ON OUR  SIDE. THANK YOU, MY FRIEND. -YOU'VE DONE GOOD WORK ON HER.  -SHE'S LUCKY I FOUND THE RIGHT PLANT -- LUCKY  THAT DAM'S THERE-- -WHAT DAM?  -JUST UP THE RIVER. THE WEEPING BLOSSOM WAS THERE. -TELL ME ABOUT THE DAM.  -NOT MUCH TO TELL. IT BLOCKS UP THE RIVER, A LITTLE OF WATER GETS THROUGH. THAT'S WHY THERE'S  NO FISH IN IT. THE DAM'S CUTTING OFF  THE CROCODILE'S FOOD SOURCE. MARIKA... -WHO BUILT THE DAM?  -THE ELDERS. IT MADE FISHING EASIER  FOR EVERYBODY. THE FISH ARE TRAPPED AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK  FOR CROCODILES. WE'LL HAVE TO  TAKE IT DOWN. -WHY?  -THE CROCODILES ARE STARVING. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE  PEOPLE ARE BEING OFFERED UP AS SACRIFICES  BY THE PHANTOMS. A ONE-EYED CROCODILE WHO IS TOO HUNGRY TO TURN AWAY. WHY WOULD YOUR  PEOPLE DO THIS? YEARS AGO, BEFORE MY TIME, YOUNG  WOMEN WERE SACRIFICED TO THE CROCODILES SO THEY'D LEAVE  ENOUGH FISH FOR THE VILLAGE. THERE'S A  CEREMONIAL GROUND -DOWN THE RIVER.  -BUT WHO ARE THESE PHANTOMS? WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO  IS TO TELL KARPEN TO GET ALL THE PEOPLE  IN THE VILLAGE AND PUT THEM IN THE ONE AREA THAT CAN  BE PROTECTED -- THEN SURROUND IT WITH ALL  THE TORCHES YOU CAN FIND, OK? OK. SO, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? TAKE DOWN THE DAM. OK, I'LL GET MY THINGS. I'LL MEET YOU DOWN THERE. KARPEN. THE MEDICINE'S WORKED. -WHO SET YOU FREE? -WE HAVE NO TIME FOR HOSTILITY. DAR'S BROUGHT  GOOD NEWS. -WHERE IS HE NOW?  -HE'S GONE TO THE DAM. THAT'S THE CAUSE  OF THE TROUBLE. YOU DON'T KNOW  WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. COME. YOU TOO. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT  THIS IS REALLY ABOUT. WHERE ARE  YOU TAKING US? WE SHOULD BE ORGANIZING THE VILLAGE AGAINST ANOTHER ATTACK. THEY'RE HERE. THESE TWO WILL DO FOR TONIGHT. KARPEN! YOU'RE ONE OF THEM? WHY? TAKE HER AWAY. ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. MY MISTAKE WAS NOT  GETTING RID OF YOU SOONER, -YOU AND YOUR MEDDLING FRIEND.  -DAR WON'T LET YOU DO THIS. BY THE TIME HE COMES FOR YOU,  YOU'LL BE DEAD. YOU DIDN'T SOMEHOW SUGGEST THAT THE VILLAGERS  BUILD THIS DAM? NO, THEY THOUGHT THIS UP  ALL BY THEMSELVES. FOR CREATURES WITH BRAINS, THEY CERTAINLY DON'T USE THEM. THEY NEVER GIVE ANY THOUGHT AS TO WHAT HARM  THEIR ACTIONS WILL DO TO THOSE THAT LIVE AROUND THEM. HELP ME TAKE IT DOWN. YOU'D RATHER HAVE YOUR OWN  CREATURES STARVE, OR WORSE, -FEED ON EACH OTHER?  -THEY'LL SEE IT WAS WORTH IT. BESIDES, SOMETIMES THIS WHOLE GUARDIAN  OF NATURE BIT GETS TIRESOME. IT NEVER MADE  CURUPIRA TIRED. WELL, SHE DIDN'T HAVE  MUCH IMAGINATION, -SHE PROTECTED HER DOMAIN.  -I'M PROTECTING IT TOO... IN MY OWN WAY. IT'S SOMETHING YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO FOR SOME  OF YOUR HUMAN FRIENDS. THE PHANTOMS HAVE  GONE BACK TO THE VILLAGE? THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE, DAR. HAVEN'T YOU FIGURED  THAT OUT YET? IT'S KARPEN. THAT'S THE BEAUTY  OF ALL THIS. THE VILLAGERS  ARE BEING TAKEN BY THEIR OWN. THE FATE THEIR DAM VISITED ON MY CROCODILES  HAS COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM. MAYBE THAT WILL TEACH THEM  TO FINALLY LEAVE MY DOMAIN ALONE. I'M SORRY I GOT YOU  INVOLVED IN THIS. YOU DIDN'T.  KARPEN DID. HE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT  THE OLD RELIGION. HE SAID THE VILLAGE HAD GROWN FAT AND WE'D LOST  OUR RESPECT FOR THE GODS AND OUR NEED TO SERVE THEM. HE WAS TEACHING  YOU A LESSON. ONE DAY A CROCODILE  ATTACKED A WOMAN KARPEN SAID IT WAS A SIGN  THAT THE OLD GODS WERE ANGRY. NO ONE BELIEVED HIM. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO ANGRY. WHY GO THIS FAR? HE SAID THAT IF WE DIDN'T MEND OUR WAYS, A TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT WOULD BE  VISITED UPON US. MM-HMM. HIS RESPECT AMONG  SOME OF THE MEN BEGAN TO GROW. AND THEY BROUGHT  OFFERINGS TO SEEK PROTECTION FOR  THEIR YOUNG WOMEN. HE SAID THE OFFERINGS  MEANT HE COULD CARE FOR ME AND NOW I SEE THEIR FEAR MEANT  MORE TO HIM THAN ANYTHING, EVEN MORE THAN ME. WHY DO YOU DO THIS  TO YOURSELF, DAR? WHY NOT LET NATURE -TAKE ITS COURSE?  -IF YOU'D HELP ME, WE COULD STOP  ALL OF THEM FROM SUFFERING, BOTH THE HUMANS  AND THE CROCODILES. WELL, LIFE'S  TOUGH, ISN'T IT? NOT MUCH IN THIS WORLD LIVES  UNLESS SOMETHING ELSE DIES. PHEW, IT'S A HARD  BALANCE TO MAINTAIN. SO YOU INCREASE THE KILLING? YOU'VE GOT TO ADMIT, IT'S A VERY ELEGANT PLAN. YOUR OWN VERSION  OF A BALANCE OF NATURE. [ LAUGHING ] YES...AND IT'S  WORKING PERFECTLY. [ CHANTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] YOU GET NEAR THE WATER. -I'LL JUMP THE CLOSEST TO YOU.  -NO. THERE'S NO  CHOICE -- DIVE IN, SWIM, I'LL  DO WHAT I CAN -TO DISTRACT THE CROCODILE  -IT'S SUICIDE. WE HAVE NO  OTHER OPTION. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, KARPEN? THIS IS  OUR RELIGION. I'M THE SPIRIT LEADER  OF OUR TRIBE. THIS IS THE OLD WAY. WE LEFT ALL THIS BEHIND. THAT'S WHY ALL  OUR TROUBLE STARTED. YOUR TROUBLE STARTED  WITH THAT DAM. DON'T SPEAK OF THINGS  YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. A SAVAGE GOD, THEY NEED  SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP. WHEN THINGS ARE EASY, THEY  FORGET TO RESPECT THEIR GODS. OR FORGET ABOUT  A SPIRIT HEALER? WHAT KIND OF SPIRIT HEALER KILLS HIS OWN PEOPLE  OR POISONS HIS INTENDED? SHE WOULD HAVE SURVIVED -- AND  ALL THOSE WHO DIDN'T BELIEVE IN ME WOULD HAVE BEEN SILENCED. TOO BAD YOU AND YOUR FRIEND  SHOWED UP WHEN YOU DID. -IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO STOP--  -SILENCE! PREPARE YOURSELF TO DIE WELL. TAKE THEM TO THE WATER. KARPEN, NO! MOVE IT! GIVE IT UP, DAR. IT'S HOPELESS! IF I CAN BREAK THE DAM, THE CROCODILES  WILL HAVE ENOUGH FOOD. THE KILLING WILL STOP. IT STOPS WHEN I SAY  IT STOPS AND NOT BEFORE. IF YOU WANT TO PREVENT  ANY MORE BLOODSHED MAYBE THERE ARE  A COUPLE HUMANS YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT INSTEAD OF THIS. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  -TAO... AND THAT PRETTY GIRL  FROM THE VILLAGE. THIS DAM WILL LAST LONGER  THAN THEY WILL. WHO'S IT GOING TO BE, DAR? CAN'T SAVE EVERYONE. NO-O-O-O! HE WON'T LISTEN TO YOU. I SAID NO, STOP HELPING HIM! I SAID NO! NO-O-O-O! YOU SEE --  SOMETIMES BOTH ANIMALS AND HUMANS KNOW BETTER THAN  THOSE WHO TRY TO CONTROL THEM. [ SCREAMING ] [ PANTING ] NICE ENTRANCE. WHAT DID YOU SAY  TO THAT CROCODILE? THAT THE FISH ARE  BACK AND THAT KARPEN'S MEN WERE RESPONSIBLE  FOR STARVING THEM. THAT ONE WAS  GOING TO KILL ME. TAO, YOU KNOW  IT WASN'T PERSONAL. I'M SORRY. IARA...IT LOOKS LIKE  THINGS WORKED OUT FOR BOTH THE HUMANS... AND THE  CROCODILES. THANKS TO YOU --  LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES, THE HUMANS WOULD HAVE DESTROYED  THEMSELVES EVENTUALLY. HMM, MAYBE NEXT TIME. LET'S GET BACK TO THE VILLAGE. HEY...HEY, THEY'RE BACK. IT WILL BE GOOD  TO GO OUT FISHING AGAIN. IT'S THE WAY FISHING  WAS MEANT TO BE. IT'S BETTER THAN  BEING ATTACKED. THANK YOU, MY FRIEND, THANK YOU. YOU WILL... RETURN, IF YOU CAN? I HAVE TO --  THERE ARE MANY POWERFUL  MEDICINES HERE. THANK YOU...BOTH OF YOU. THANK YOU. SHE'S BECOME  VERY ATTACHED TO YOU. PEOPLE ALWAYS FEEL CLOSE  TO PEOPLE THAT HEAL THEM. BESIDES, WITH EVERYTHING  THAT'S HAPPENED, SHE HAS MUCH TO THINK ABOUT. OH, I GUESS  THAT FITS WITH YOUR PHILOSOPHY  ABOUT THE RIVER. HOW SO? WELL, SHE'LL BE  DIFFERENT THE NEXT TIME  YOU SEE HER. THE RIVER MAY CHANGE, DAR, BUT IT'S STILL A RIVER. OW...OW! CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
