 STAY WHERE YOU ARE. DON'T YOU KNOW TRAVELLING THROUGH THIS FOREST  IS FORBIDDEN? BRING HIM TO ME. COME WITH ME. NORDS EVERYWHERE. VODEN'S ARMY GROWS BY THE DAY. HIS ARROGANCE GROWS WITH IT. HE'S DECLARED THE AREA  AROUND XINCA OFF LIMITS. EVEN THE ANIMALS ARE TRESPASSERS  IN THEIR OWN FOREST. IT'S AN ACT  OF DESPERATION. KING ZAD ALSO HAS AN ARMY. WAR IS APPROACHING. PERHAPS THEY'LL WIPE  EACH OTHER OUT.

 PERHAPS, BUT WHEN  ARMIES CLASH, -EVERYONE SUFFERS.  -UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS TRUE. ARE YOU HERE AS AN OBSERVER? FOR NOW. WE MUST ALL BE READY. DAR! I WAS BEING CHASED  BY NORD SOLDIERS NO, NO, IT'S OK.  I'M SURE THEY'RE, UH... APPARENTLY, WE'RE NOT  ALLOWED INSIDE THE CITY. DID YOU MEET SOLON? NO, HE'D ALREADY LEFT. SAYING THAT HE THINKS HE FOUND  MYDORO -- THE LOST CITY. GUESS I DIDN'T LOSE THEM. COME ON, KILLER. WHAT'S THIS ABOUT MYDORO? WELL-- OOF! KEEP YOUR DISTANCE,  THEY'RE POISONOUS. THE LIZARDS OF MYDORO. THE ONES THE LEGENDS  SAY SAFEGUARD THE SOULS OF THE WATCHFUL DEAD. EXACTLY. IT'S LIKE THE HUACAS -- THE OBSIDIAN MIRRORS OF XINCA. ONLY MUCH, MUCH OLDER. IT WORKED. THE ENTRANCE TO MYDORO. AND OUR PASSAGEWAY TO THE INCREDIBLE KNOWLEDGE  OF OUR ANCESTORS. IF YOU HADN'T BEEN  DAYDREAMING IN MY LECTURES, YOU'D REMEMBER YOU HAVE  TO PASS THROUGH CAVES TO GET TO THE CHAMBER  OF THE SUN. IF THIS IS MYDORO, WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS --  THERE'S A CURSE. THE CURSE IS FOR STRANGERS. WE ARE NOT STRANGERS. WE EIRONS BELONG HERE. AND FRANKLY,  IF TAO HAD JOINED US, HE'D BE IN THERE  ALREADY -- LET'S GO. BRING THE TORCHES  AND THE FLINTS. WHAT'S IN THERE? UNTOLD KNOWLEDGE, ANSWERS I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR  ALL MY LIFE. NO! NOT TOGETHER! ONE AT A-- SOLID ROCK. IT WON'T MOVE. SOLON! SOLON! SOLON!  SOLON! CAN YOU HEAR ME, SOLON? SOLON! SOLON! IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... WHAT'LL WE DO?  HE COULD SUFFOCATE. TRY THE RING  ON THE CRYSTAL.  IN MY BAG. THEY'RE POISONOUS. FIND A WEAPON. [ SCREAMING ] WHAT? WHAT? RIKKO? RIKKO. -WE NEED HELP.  -WE CAN'T LEAVE HIM THERE. -WE HAVE NO CHOICE.  -I'M NOT LEAVING HIM HERE. -I'M NOT GOING--  -WE'RE GOING, NOW! [ DAR ]: I'VE HEARD  STORIES ABOUT MYDORO. LIKE EVERYONE ELSE,  I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS THAT --  STORIES. SO DO MOST EIRONS. SOLON IS ONE OF THE GREAT  TRUE BELIEVERS. HE'S SPENT HIS LIFE  DEVOTED TO UNRAVELLING THE MYSTERIES OF  THE ANCIENT MYDORIAN TEXTS. THE MYDORANS  WERE YOUR ANCESTORS? YEAH...BUT THEIR CIVILIZATION  WAS FAR BEYOND ANYTHING THAT WE COULD EVER IMAGINE. THEY WERE ABLE TO HARNESS  THE POWER OF THE SUN. WHAT FOR? WELL, TO GAIN  KNOWLEDGE OF HEALING AND TO PROVIDE HEAT AND LIGHT  FOR WHEN IT WAS DARK. YOU BETTER NOT TELL ME THE  EIRONS WERE ONCE CONQUERERS. I'M NOT GOING  TO TELL YOU THAT. THEY DID DEVELOP A  WEAPON SO POWERFUL THAT NO ONE COULD  STAND AGAINST IT. SO THEY COULD  LIVE IN PEACE. THAT'S ALL THE  EIRONS EVER WANTED. THAT'S ALL ANYONE  EVER WANTED. WELL, PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE IT  AGAIN, IF SOLON'S RIGHT. WELL...HE'S ALWAYS MAINTAINED THAT MYDORO WAS CLOSER TO XINCA THAN ANYONE ACTUALLY BELIEVED. SO, IT'S, IT'S IN THE UPLANDS. SO, WHAT ARE WE  WAITING FOR? LORIEL, WAIT. THERE'S SOME  PEOPLE THROUGH THERE. MUST BE, EIRONS AREN'T SO OBVIOUS. COME, WE'LL NEED HELP. WE CAN'T TELL NORDS  ABOUT MYDORO. WE WON'T,  WITH THE CORRECT APPROACH. NO, SOLON WOULD  RATHER DIE. POSSIBLY, IF WE DON'T  RESCUE HIM. LOOK, JUST TAKE MY HAND. ACT LIKE WE'RE  LOVERS OUT WALKING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? JUST WALKING. ENTERING THIS PART OF THE FOREST HAS BEEN FORBIDDEN SORRY. WE DIDN'T KNOW.  WE WERE PICKING HERBS. -IS THAT WHAT'S IN THE POUCH?  -YES. THERE'S ALSO SOME PERSONAL  THINGS -- WOMEN'S THINGS. I SAID, LET ME SEE. WHY ARE YOU HARASSING US?  WHEN WE'VE DONE NOTHING WRONG. WOMEN'S THINGS. WE FOUND THEM. WHILE PICKING HERBS. -YES.  -IT'S TRUE. KEEP THEM  IF YOU LIKE. I THINK KING VODEN  SHOULD SEE THEM. TAKE THEM. NO! RUN! RUN! -RUN!  -HOLD HIM! NO! RUN! RUN, LORIEL, RUN! SO, IF THE MYDORANS WERE INVINCIBLE, HOW'D THEIR  CITY FALL? WELL, SOLON THINKS THAT  THERE WAS CIVIL WAR. A FIGHT FOR CONTROL  OF THE WEAPON. WHICH MEANS  NOT EVERYONE NO -- THERE WERE MANY  THAT WERE CORRUPTED BY POWER. THE RESULT WAS  THE DAY OF CATASTROPHE -- THE END OF MYDORO.  IT'S BEEN LOST EVER SINCE. DID SOLON CONSIDER IT MAY  BE BETTER IF IT STAYED LOST? -WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  -MAYBE IT'S NOT WISE TO RETURN SUCH A  WEAPON TO THE WORLD. THERE'S MUCH MORE  KNOWLEDGE TO THE CIVILIZATION --  WE CAN'T TURN OUR BACKS. [ CAWING ] -SOMEONE'S IN TROUBLE.  -WHAT IS IT? STAY HERE. YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN  RUNNING AROUND IN CIRCLES? LET'S JOIN YOUR FRIEND. MAYBE SHE HAS OTHER PLANS. IT'S YOU AGAIN. [ ROARING ] YOU ALL RIGHT? WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME'S DAR. BEASTMASTER...TAO'S FRIEND. -YOU KNOW TAO?  -ONLY BY REPUTATION. IS HE HERE? MY FRIEND NEEDS HIS HELP. LOOKS LIKE YOU NEED SOME HELP. NO, NO, MY TEACHER'S  IN TROUBLE. IS IT SOLON? -WHAT HAPPENED?  -WE FOUND THE WAY  INTO MYDORO. SOLON'S TRAPPED INSIDE,  AND RIKKO AND I WENT FOR HELP, BUT... AHH! MILORD. HJALMAR, THIS IS MAGNIFICENT. WORTHY OF A KING. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING  LIKE THIS BEFORE. WHERE DID YOU SAY  YOU FOUND THEM? IN THE FOREST. I DON'T KNOW  EXACTLY WHERE. WE WERE-- YES -- GATHERING HERBS. WITH A GIRL  WHO RAN AWAY RATHER THAN FACE ME WITH THE SAME  RIDICULOUS STORY. BUT IT'S THE TRUTH. REALLY? YES. DOES THIS MAN  HAVE FAMILY IN XINCA? HAVE THEM BROUGHT THERE. WAIT... I'LL SHOW YOU. AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, PERHAPS YOU'LL TELL ME WHO THIS GIRL IS, AND HOW SHE KNOWS  THE BEASTMASTER. HELLO. OH, I, UM... UH, DAR, TOLD ME THAT YOU WEREN'T FFELING WELL, SO I, UM... I'M TAO...TAO. HAPPY TO MEET YOU, TAO. I'M LORIEL --  ACTUALLY, I'M FEELING -MUCH BETTER, THANKS.  -OH, GOOD...GOOD. IF I COULD JUST... OH, UH, PLEASE. ARE WE GOING TO BE  LEAVING RIGHT AWAY? OH, AS SOON AS YOU'RE READY. CAN YOU FIND THIS CAVE AGAIN? I THINK SO. MY FRIEND RIKKO COULD TAKE YOU RIGHT THERE. DAR WILL FIND HIM. SOUNDS LIKE SOLON'S  IN MORE DANGER. I DON'T EVEN KNOW  IF HE'S ALIVE. IF HE'S FOUND MYDORO, HE WON'T LET ANYTHING  KNOCK HIM OFF HIS FEET. -I HOPE SO.  -I KNOW SO. HOW IS SHE? SHE'S FINE... QUITE FINE. THIS FRIEND OF  HERS -- RIKKO... VODEN WOULD HAVE  TAKEN HIM TO XINCA BY NOW. WHICH MEANS VODEN  PROBABLY KNOWS ABOUT MYDORO. RIKKO WOULDN'T TELL HIM. I DON'T THINK  THERE'S MUCH CHOICE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE MEANS... WE'RE PROBABLY  NOT THE ONLY PEOPLE SO, HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU  TO GET THERE FROM XINCA? -HALF A DAY.  -HA! OH, UH, THAT MEAN'S SOLON'S  RIGHT -- IT'S CLOSE. [ GROWLING ] OH, DON'T WORRY. THAT'S RUH.  HE'S A FRIEND. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY TURN OUT  TO BE TRUE -- TELL ME MORE ABOUT MYDORO. I NEVER EVEN BELIEVED  IN THE STORIES, UNTIL-- UNTIL YOU FOUND IT. ALL WE FOUND WAS A CAVE. IT COULD HAVE LED ANYWHERE. WITH ARTEFACTS LIKE THIS  LYING AROUND? NO, IT'S THERE, ALL RIGHT,  AND LOCKED INSIDE IS THE MOST POWERFUL  WEAPON EVER DESIGNED. THE SUN CRYSTAL WAS DESTROYED  ON THE DAY OF CATASTROPHE. YOU KNOW THIS, DO YOU? ALL OF MYDORO  WAS DESTROYED. THIS WASN'T. YOU KNOW THE LEGEND, HJALMAR? A CRYSTAL SO POWERFUL  THAT IT COULD CAPTURE THE SUN AND FIRE IT LIKE  AN ARROW OF PURE LIGHT... OR PURE DESTRUCTION --  THINK OF IT. IF WE'RE LUCKY, WE SHOULD  GET THERE BEFORE DARK. BE SURE  WE'RE LUCKY. WE WERE HERE...AND WE CROSSED  THE STREAM AND WENT UP THERE. -IT'S VODEN.  -IS RIKKO WITH HIM? THERE'S A YOUNG  EIRON WITH HIM. IT'S RIKKO. YOU TWO GO. I'LL CATCH UP. RUH...LET'S GO.  I NEED YOUR HELP. SO, IT'S TRUE. HE REALLY DOES-- DOES SPEAK TO  THE ANIMALS. WELL...NOT... IT'S CONFUSING.  IT-- YES, HE DOES. YES, HE DOES. HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT,  WON'T HE? OF COURSE, OF COURSE. BEASTMASTER. VODEN... HJALMAR... SO, IS THIS PART OF THE FOREST  OFF LIMITS, TOO, OR CAN THE ANIMALS  RUN FREELY HERE? EVERYTHING ROAMS FREELY  IN MY LAND, BEASTMASTER. I AM THE GREATEST  OF ALL RULERS. [ CHUCKLING ] YOU ARE THE GREATEST OF LIARS. HIS IMPERTINENCE MAKES HIM CARELESS -- WE CAN TAKE HIM. HE'S TRYING TO BAIT US.  HE WANTS US TO GO AFTER HIM. MAKE SURE  OUR FRIEND HERE DOESN'T GET ANY IDEAS. YOU SEE? IT'S A GAME, TO KEEP US FROM MYDORO, MORE GAMES. WHERE'S GILDEN?  I POSTED HIM AS A REAR GUARD. THIS IS IDIOTIC.  YOU HAVE WEAPONS. YOU HAVE NOTHING  TO BE AFRAID OF. VODEN'S RIGHT.  STAY TOGETHER ON THE PATH. NO STRAGGLERS. THIS IS IT. OH, MY PACK. THE DOOR'S THROUGH THERE.  SOLON'S RING MADE IT OPEN. -REMEMBER HOW IT'S DONE? -HE WAVED IT OVER THE CRYSTALS, I DIDN'T SEE.  THERE WERE LIZARDS EVERYWHERE. LIZARDS? GUARDIANS OF THE WATCHFUL DEAD. SOLON SAYS THEY'RE POISONOUS.  TRY YOUR RING ON THE DOOR. WAS THERE  A PARTICUALAR PATTERN? HE MOVED HIS HAND  UP AND ACROSS. CARDINAL POINTS. NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST. OH, SOLON. LEGENDS SAY THESE CAVES LEAD TO THE CHAMBER OF THE SUN. AND THE CHAMBER OF THE WATCHFUL  DEAD. GAVE ME NIGHTMARES. YEAH, ME TOO. AH! ONE AT A TIME.  OTHERWISE THE DOOR CLOSES. -AFTER YOU.  -NO, AFTER YOU. THERE ARE SO MANY PASSAGES  LEADING EVERYWHERE. WHICH ONE DO WE TAKE? WE MUST FIND A SIGN  OF SOLON TO BE SURE. [ GASPING ] LET'S TRY THIS WAY. BATS. NO! KEEP LOW! [ SCREAMING ] TAO, LOOK. SOLON'S TORCH. WHAT'S WRONG? THE SIZE OF THESE PRINTS. LET'S TAKE THIS SLOWLY. DID YOU HEAR THAT? -SOMETHING'S MOVING.  -WHAT WAS IT? AHH!  [ GASPING ] DON'T MOVE. LIZARDS ARE  ATTRACTED TO MOVEMENT. LET'S KEEP GOING. SOLON. IS IT READY YET? ALMOST. [ GROWLING ] KIND OF A DARK  NIGHT, HUH? IT'S JUST A TIGER. I'VE KILLED HUNDREDS LIKE HIM. THESE MEN ARE COWARDS.  ORGANIZE A HUNTING PARTY. AT NIGHT?  IN THE FOREST? AND THIS ONE.  KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. WHEN WE REACH MYDORO,  SLIT HIS THROAT. FIND A WAY TO GET US MOVING NOW. [ GROWLING ] IT'S WORKING. [ GROWLING ] LET'S HOPE THAT'S  AS BIG AS THE LIZARDS GET. HOW COULD SOLON  GET THIS FAR WITHOUT A TORCH? ACTUALLY, WE'RE NOT THAT FAR. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  -WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. IF MY SENSE OF DIRECTION  DOESN'T IMPROVE, THERE WAS NO PLACE WE COULD HAVE TURNED, WAS THERE? NO. LIKE A SCORPION IN A MAZE. THE WINDING TUNNELS OF MYDORO --  YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THEM LIKE -A SCORPION IN A MAZE.  -GO BACK TO GET AHEAD. LET'S GO BACK. AHH! WE WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THAT... ...UNLESS YOU  WERE WALKING BACK. THERE'S SOMETHING  SHINY HERE. LOOK. WHAT IS IT? IT'S CRYSTAL. IT GLOWS WHEN YOU TOUCH IT. IT GLOWS BRIGHTER  WHEN WE BOTH TOUCH IT. IT'S CHANGING. LOOK. CHAMBER OF THE WATCHFUL DEAD. HERE'S ANOTHER ONE. TOA, LOOK. OVER HERE. AH...AH, THERE'S ONE  OVER HERE AS WELL. THAT'S FOUR. WHITE, BLUE, AMBER AND GREEN. THE COLOURS MUST  HAVE SOME KIND OF MEANING. THIS SHOULD BE  A PORTAL TO THE CHAMBER OF THE SUN, BUT I CAN'T  SEE ANY EASY WAY OUT. SOLON MUST HAVE FOUND IT,  OR WE WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM. WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING. [ GROWLING ] THEY'RE COMING AFTER YOU. LET THEM COME. I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. [ GROWLING ] [ GROWLING ]  [ GROWLING ] DID YOU HEAR THAT? YEAH...THEY MUST  BE EVERYWHERE. THEY'RE ALL AROUND US.  WHAT DO WE DO? MY LORD, WE CAN'T  GO OUT IN THIS. THIS IS  THE BEASTMASTER. I GUESS THEY DON'T KNOW  THAT TIGERS HUNT ALONE. I THINK THEY'RE  HERE FOR THE NIGHT. THANK YOU. THIS SEEMS SIMPLE,  BUT MAYBE THERE'S A SEQUENCE, LIKE THE CARDINAL  POINTS AT THE FRONT DOOR. RIGHT, LET'S TRY THAT. AW! AWWW! SOLON? SOLON! -LORIEL?  -YES. AND TAO. I WOULDN'T MISS  THIS MOMENT FOR ANYTHING. YOU'VE BEEN BITTEN. LIZARDS. I HAVE SOME HERBS. SO DO I -- IT CONTROLS THE FEVER AND SLOWS THE POISON, BUT I'LL NEED SOMETHING MORE. THE SUN CRYSTAL CAN HEAL. IF ONLY I COULD REACH IT. THE CHAMBER OF THE SUN  HAS TO BE THROUGH HERE. HOW DO WE GET IN? WHEN THE WATCHFUL  DEAD ARE REBORN... REBORN? REBORN HOW? YOU CAN'T KEEP IT AWAY. GO, WHILE THERE'S  STILL A CHANCE. -NOT WITHOUT YOU!  -IT'S THE ONLY WAY. WE'RE NOT LEAVING YOU HERE. PLEASE. DO AS I SAY... OR YOU'LL DIE HERE WITH ME. GO! -TAO...  -SOLON, PLEASE. SOLON. TAO? DAR! -YOU ALL RIGHT? -NOT EXACTLY -- WE FOUND SOLON, BUT BE CAREFUL --  THE LIZARD'S POISONOUS. DON'T WORRY. HE WON'T  BOTHER YOU ANY MORE. WHERE'S VODEN? IT'S ALMOST DAWN.  HE WON'T BE THERE MUCH LONGER. -DON'T THINK HE'LL LIVE.  -THE SUN CRYSTAL CAN HEAL HIM. IT'S THROUGH THERE. APPARENTLY, THERE'S  A SECRET DEVICE SOMEWHERE INSIDE THIS CHAMBER, WHERE THE WATCHFUL  DEAD ARE REBORN. THE WATCHFUL DEAD ARE BEHIND  THESE GLOWING PANELS. YEAH, THERE'S FOUR OF THEM.  EACH HAVE A DIFFERENT COLOUR. BLUE, WHITE, AMBER... BUT WE DON'T KNOW  WHAT THEY'RE FOR. YOU SAID THE MYDORANS HARNESSED THE POWER OF THE SUN. THE SUN HAS  FOUR POSITIONS IN THE SKY. FOUR SEASONS. THE COLOURS OF THE FOUR SEASONS. BLUE FOR WINTER,  WHITE FOR SUMMER. GREEN FOR SPRING. THE SEASON OF REBIRTH. SO, NOW WHAT? THERE'S A HOLLOW. -IT'S BEEN CUT.  -WHAT GOES INTO IT? -YOUR RING.  -THE RING. LET'S GO. WE'RE THROUGH. ALL RIGHT...YOU'VE MADE IT. -THE CHAMBER OF THE SUN.  -YES. NOTHING, I JUST FEEL  LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. I KNOW WHAT  YOU MEAN. ALL EIRONS FEEL THAT. THIS PLACE IS  WHERE WE COME FROM. EVERYTHING WE BUILT... XINCA... WAS OUR MEMORY OF IT... THIS IS REALITY. SO, WHAT DO WE DO NOW? FEED THE SUN CRYSTAL... THE OTHER CRYSTALS. LISTEN. IT'S WHAT SOLON CALLS  THE HARMONY OF THE SPHERES. AHH! NO. SOLON? SOLON? SOLON? NO! SOLON! SOLON! CAN YOU HEAR ME, SOLON? SOLON? NO, SOLON. AM I DREAMING? WE ALL ARE. WHAT IS THIS,  SOME KIND OF SORCERY? NO, NOT SORCERY, SCIENCE. THAT CRYSTAL HAS  THE POWER TO HEAL AND DESTROY. YOU TWO LEARNED  YOUR LESSONS WELL. BUT WHERE'S RIKKO? VODEN HAS HIM. AND HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE NOW. WHEN YOU WERE TRAPPED, RIKKO AND I WENT FOR HELP. WHEN THE NORDS STOPPED US,  THEY STOLE A CRYSTAL -AND DAGGER WE FOUND OUTSIDE.  -THIS CRYSTAL... WAS IT INLAID WITH GOLD? IT WAS MORE THAN INLAID. IT WAS ALMOST FUSED TO IT. WE FOUND IT WITH  A DEAD MAN. A SKELETON. -THE FIRE CRYSTAL. THE DEAD MAN WAS PROBABLY  TRYING TO DESTROY IT... IF ONLY HE HAD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT BELONGS HERE --  IT'S WHAT TRANSFORMS AN INSTRUMENT OF HEALING  INTO AN INSTRUMENT OF DEATH. IF IT'S BROUGHT BACK, THE DAY OF CATASTROPHE  WILL BE UPON US AGAIN. WE'D DO BETTER TO DESTROY  MYDORO THAN RISK THAT. NO...THERE'S TOO MUCH  HERE THAT CAN HELP THE WORLD. HE DIED WITH  THE CRYSTAL IN HIS HAND. YES. PERHAPS IT WAS WORTH DYING FOR. WE'RE GOING IN. YOU'D RATHER STAY  OUT HERE WITH THE LIZARDS? APPARENTLY THEY'RE POISONOUS. DON'T WORRY,  RIKKO WILL GO IN FIRST. IT'S ALL WRITTEN HERE. -THE GOOD AND THE BAD.  -THE LIBRARY. PART OF IT -- THE REST MUST BE  MIXED THROUGHOUT THE CHAMBERS. WE'VE BARELY SCRATCHED  THE SURFACE HERE. THE SCROLL THAT  DESCRIBES THE WEAPON. -IF VODON FINDS THIS--  -THAT MUST NEVER HAPPEN. WE'LL HAVE TO GO BACK. NOW. YES, GO. QUICKLY. I'LL FOLLOW. I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE TRYING  TO FIND THIS PLACE, TAO. I NEED A MOMENT. [ GASPING ] AHH! GET HIM OFF ME!  GET THEM OFF! [ SCREAMING ] CAN WE MOVE FORWARD NOW? STAY OUTSIDE  AND GUARD THE ENTRANCE. MAKE SURE NO ONE LEAVES. THIS CAVE IS ENDLESS. WHERE IS MYDORO? [ VODEN ]: KEEP GOING. WAIT. LOOK EVERYWHERE. WHAT WE WANT IS HERE SOMEWHERE. -RIKKO'S PROBABLY WITH HIM.  -WHAT WILL WE DO? GO GET SOLON.  WE HAVE TO LEAVE NOW. WHAT IS IT? THERE IS A CURSE ON THIS PLACE. FORGET THE LIZARDS. FORGET THE CURSE. WE MOVE FORWARD, NOW! SOLON, THE NORDS ARE HERE. TELL THEM I'M COMING. THEY'RE COMING. WHAT'S THAT? SOLON STARTED SOMETHING. [ DOOR SLAMMING ] HE MUST THINK WE'VE GOTTEN OUT. OR HE'S TRYING TO STOP  VODEN FROM GETTING IN. SOLON! SOLON! SOLON! SOLON! SOLON! TAO, THERE'S NO TIME.  WE HAVE TO GO. VODEN AND HIS MEN  ARE THERE. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT. -TAO, COME ON.  -YEAH. -WHAT'S HAPPENING?  -IT'S THE CURSE. STRANGERS MUST  NEVER ENTER MYDORO. LET'S LEAVE  WHILE WE CAN. NO, WE'RE NOT LEAVING  WITHOUT THAT WEAPON. MY ARMY MUST HAVE  ARROWS OF LIGHT. IF WE DON'T LEAVE HERE,  WE'LL BE BURIED HERE. HE'S RIGHT. WE MUST LEAVE. SILENCE HIM. HOW FAST ARE YOU? STAY WHERE YOU ARE. STOP! I SAID STAY WHERE YOU ARE. LORIEL! AHH! RIKKO. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? THERE'S NO TIME FOR REUNIONS. GET OUT OF HERE. -WHAT ABOUT SOLON?  -HE'S DOING WHAT HE CAN. LET'S GO. GET THIS THING OFF ME. AND IF I DO? YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE ME HERE. NO? BEASTMASTER! BEASTMASTER! WE SHOULD LEAVE. IF YOU'RE LOOKING  FOR GRATITUDE... HAVEN'T YOU  HAD ENOUGH? MORE THAN ENOUGH.  LET'S GET CLEAR. THAT'S SOME GOOD ADVICE. SOLON! TAO. POOR SOLON --  TO HAVE THE DREAM OF A LIFETIME COME TRUE,  ONLY TO DESTROY IT. HE DID WHAT  HE HAD TO DO. THERE MUST HAVE  BEEN ANOTHER WAY. NO. WHATEVER GOOD HE  COULD HAVE SALVAGED FROM MYDORO WOULD  HAVE ONLY BEEN DESTROYED BY  THE EVIL OF VODEN. STILL...SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE LOST. IT'S NOT LOST,  IT'S WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO DISCOVER IT  WHO WILL USE IT BETTER. MYDORO'S GONE. BUT THE LEGEND CONTINUES -- SOLON WILL ALWAYS  BE PART OF IT. I THINK HE WOULD  HAVE LIKED THAT. YES, HE WOULD. YES, HE WOULD. YOU DID THE BEST  YOU COULD, YOU KNOW THAT. THE GATHERING  WAR CLOUDS WOULD BE MUCH DARKER IF VODEN  HAD SUCCEEDED. BUT WE STILL LOST A GOOD MAN. THIS ONE COULD HAVE MADE  A DIFFERENCE IN THE FUTURE. THEY SHARE HIS HUNGER  FOR KNOWLEDGE -- AND PERHAPS THEY'LL MAKE  A DIFFERENCE IN HIS PLACE. I HOPE SO. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
