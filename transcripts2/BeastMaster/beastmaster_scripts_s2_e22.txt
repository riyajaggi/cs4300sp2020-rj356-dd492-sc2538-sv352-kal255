 TOO BAD. I NEED THEM. WHAT FOR? TO BREAK DOWN  THE WALLS OF XINCA, SO I CAN  TAKE MY REVENGE ON THAT INSIPID LITTLE RUNT  WHO TRIED TO DESTROY ME. YOUR WAR WITH VODEN HAS NOTHING  TO DO WITH THESE ELEPHANTS. THAT LITTLE PEACOCK HIDES  FROM US BEHIND THE WALLS OF HIS CITY --  THESE BEASTS ARE GOING TO HELP SCATTER  THE STONES THAT PROTECT HIM. NOW SHUT THEM UP. [ ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING ] YOU'D RISK THEIR LIVES  IN BATTLE? IF THEY SURVIVE, I'LL FREE THEM. BUT IF THEY DON'T COOPERATE RIGHT NOW, I'LL  HAVE THEM SLAUGHTERED. NOW! THAT'S BETTER. [ GROANING ] CAN'T YOU SEE  IT'S WRONG TO FORCE THESE ANIMALS  INTO YOUR WAR? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I SEE. IF I LET YOU GO,  YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK AND TRY TO RESCUE THEM,  AREN'T YOU? I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ALLOW  THAT TO HAPPEN. -TRY AND KILL HIM.  -SPEAR CARRIERS. FORM RANKS. ARCHERS, DROP YOUR SWORDS. MAKE READY. ARCHERS READY? YOU, AFTER THE BEASTMASTER. READY YOUR WEAPONS. ARCHERS READY. TAKE AIM. AIM. TAO. TAO! BEASTMASTER... I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME. I AM GOING TO CRUSH VODEN. AND THE ELEPHANTS  ARE GOING TO HELP ME. YOU TRY TO FREE THEM, AND YOUR FRIEND DIES. TRY TO RESCUE HIM... I'LL KILL THE ELEPHANTS. DAR, DON'T WORRY  ABOUT ME. ARGHHH! ZAD! IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO TAO  OR THE ELEPHANTS... YOU'LL ANSWER TO ME. FIRE. DAR! TWO MEN GUARDING  THE PRISONER AT ALL TIMES. AND SEND SOME SKIRMISHERS  TO SCOUT THE APPROACHES TO XINCA. SO...WHERE ARE YOU FELLOWS FROM? -WHERE DID YOU--  -COME FROM? I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT  MY CRAFT TO ANSWER THAT YET. AH, A SORCERESS. A VERY YOUNG SORCERESS. BECAUSE I APPEAR YOUNG,  YOU DO NOT FEAR ME? OH, NO, I RESPECT  ALL OF YOUR KIND. IN FACT, A SORCERESS WHO  COULD HAVE BEEN YOUR SISTER, YOUR OLDER SISTER,  WAS VERY GOOD TO ME. -REALLY?  -YES. SAVED ME FROM MY WORST ENEMY. -VODEN.  -THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'VE ARRIVED AT  A VERY AUSPICIOUS MOMENT. WOULD IT BE TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR YOUR  FAVOUR AS WELL? WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU HAVE A LARGE ARMY, AND  NOW YOU'VE CAPTURED ELEPHANTS. I NEED EVERY ADVANTAGE  I CAN DEVISE. AND ANYTHING YOU  CAN DO TO HELP ME. THERE IS DANGER IN TRYING  TO TURN THE HAND OF FATE. ONE NEVER KNOWS  WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. BUT VODEN IS  HEARTLESS AND CRUEL. YES, A COLD CREATURE. ONE WHO DOESN'T  HAVE RESPECT FOR THE POWERS  OF THE FANTASTIC. IF HE'S ALLOWED  TO CONTINUE, WHAT SORT OF  WORLD WILL HE MAKE? AND WHAT SORT OF WORLD  WILL YOU MAKE? HA, HA, I'M NOT INTERESTED  IN EMPIRE BUILDING. FIGHTING'S NOT THE WAY  I PREFER TO SPEND MY DAY. MMM...YES, YOUR CONQUESTS ARE LEGEND. YES, BUT NOW I MUST ALSO  STAND AS A WARRIOR IN ORDER TO RID THE WORLD  OF THIS DESPICABLE CHILD. EVEN AT THE COST  OF THE ELEPHANTS? IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY TO CLEANSE THE LAND OF HIS EVIL. TELL ME THIS AT LEAST. WHAT DOES THE HAND OF FATE  HOLD IN STORE FOR ME? IF I TOLD YOU, WOULDN'T  THAT TAKE THE FUN OUT OF IT? WHOSE ARMY IS THIS? ZAD? I SHOULD HAVE KILLED HIM  WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE. HE'LL KILL HIM IF I TRY FREEING THE ELEPHANTS. THEN WE'LL RESCUE TAO FIRST. NO, HE'LL KILL  THE ELEPHANTS. ZAD'S TIME IN EXILE HAS  ONLY MADE HIM WORSE. WHERE IS HE? SOMEWHERE IN THERE. [ TWIG SNAPPING ] ARINA. HJALMAR. I WAS TRACKING ZAD. HE WAS JUST HERE. HJALMAR... WHATEVER  HAS PASSED BETWEEN US, YOU KNOW HOW MUCH  I WANT HIM DEAD. IMAGINE HOW MUCH VODEN  WOULD HAVE REWARDED ME FOR DELIVERING  HIS TWO WORST ENEMIES IN ONE DAY -- WELL... A BIRD IN THE HAND. YOU'RE GETTING AHEAD  OF YOURSELF. WHO'S THE BIRD NOW? I'D SAY, THE ONE  ABOUT TO BE PUT IN A CAGE. SO WHEN DOES YOUR BATTLE START? YOU KNOW THAT  IF YOUR ELEPHANTS CAN'T BREAK XINCA'S DEFENCES  IN THE OPENING RUSH THAT VODEN'S ARCHERS  WILL CUT YOU TO SHREDS. SO NOW YOU'RE  A PHILOSOPHER IN THE ARTS OF WAR. I KNOW GOOD GENERALS DON'T  RISK ALL ON A SINGLE STRATEGY. YOU'RE A BRIGHT LAD, TAO. YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A SHINING  FUTURE WITH SOMEONE LIKE ME. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND  WHY YOU WASTE YOUR TIME TRAMPING THROUGH THE FORESTS  WITH THAT GUTLESS SAVAGE. AT LEAST WITH HIM,  THERE IS A FUTURE. ONCE THEY'VE HELPED US  TAKE XINCA, THEIR HIDES WILL BUY US A GREAT VICTORY FEAST. I DON'T THINK WE'LL  GET MUCH FOR YOUR HIDE. A LOYAL SUBJECT RETURNS. WE FOUND HER WITH ZAD WHILE  WE WERE OUT SCOUTING. UNFORTUNATELY,  HE ESCAPED. -I WAS TRYING TO KILL HIM.  -SO SHE SAYS. WHAT DID YOU LEARN  OF ZAD'S ARMY? THEY'RE OUTCASTS AND RABBLE  FROM A DOZEN DEFEATED TRIBES. MANY OR FEW. WE'VE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM MEN  WHO'VE NEVER TASTED VICTORY. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE  AN ARMY OF MEN CLINGING TO THEIR LAST HOPE, HJALMAR. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU  NEED TO KNOW ABOUT ZAD'S ARMY. WHY WOULD I LISTEN TO YOU? I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU ANY MORE. I ONCE KNEW A WARRIOR LIKE YOU, WHO FOUGHT BY OUR SIDE TO AVENGE THE MURDEROUS CRUELTIES  DONE TO HER PEOPLE BY THE TERRONS. BUT SHE'S NO MORE. SHE REJECTED EVERYTHING  I OFFERED. SHE COULD HAVE STOOD BESIDE ME  ASTRIDE THE WORLD. ONE OF THE FEW DESTINED  FOR GREATNESS. BUT NOW, IN MY EYES,  SHE IS DEAD. YOU'VE ONLY TO SAY THE WORD. A QUICK BLOW WITH A SWORD. I DON'T THINK SO. VODEN, I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU  NEED TO FEAR FROM KING ZAD. I FEAR NOTHING FROM ZAD. HE HAS NEW WEAPONS. HIS ARMY GROWS DAILY,  WITH BATTLE-HARDENED WARRIORS. AND HE HAS ELELPHANTS. ELEPHANTS? AND YOU SAW NONE OF THIS? I SAW ONLY SHE AND ZAD. AND COULDN'T GET  CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE A LITTLE THING LIKE ELEPHANTS. YOU DO ME WRONG, SIRE. I HAVE NO REASON  TO DECEIVE YOU. SHE DOES. TAKE HER TO THE FIGHTING PIT. YOU WILL DIE SCREAMING  AND THOSE SCREAMS WILL BE MUSIC TO MY EARS. THE NORDS HAVE TAKEN HER. -TAKEN WHERE?  -TO XINCA. VODEN INTENDS TO MAKE  AN EXAMPLE OF HER. YOU CAN GO AFTER HER. TAO WILL BE SAFE FOR NOW. -CAN YOU HELP HIM?  -I'VE LEARNED THE COST OF INTERFERENCE --  WITHOUT MY TEACHER HERE, I CAN'T AFFORD  TO CREATE CONSEQUENCES I CAN'T OVERTURN. [ SCREECHING ] -I HAVEN'T FORGOT ABOUT HIM?  -I THINK HE ALREADY KNOWS. JUST FOR YOU. YOU'RE PAYING  A HIGH PRICE FOR REVENGE. IS THAT SO? IF I WERE FREE,  I COULD HELP YOU FIGHT ZAD. YOU ARE GOING TO  HELP ME FIGHT ZAD. YOU HELPED ME  BRING METAL TO THIS LAND. AND NOW METAL IS GOING TO TAKE YOU FROM IT. WHY DON'T WE JUST KILL HER? BEASTMASTER WILL TRY  AND RESCUE HER. WE'LL HAVE TO BATTLE HIM  AS WELL AS ZAD. YOU FEAR THE BEASTMASTER? OUR ARMY MUST BE CONCENTRATED  ON DEFENDING THE CITY. UNDERSTAND THIS. I WANT THE BEASTMASTER TO COME. AND WHEN HE DOES, HE'LL  HELP US DEFEAT ZAD. ARINA'S THE BAIT  TO GET HIM HERE. I PREFER TO THINK  OF HER AS THE SACRIFICE. VERY CLEVER. WE FOUND THAT TRAP DOOR  SOME TIME AGO. WE KNEW YOU'D BE CLEVER  ENOUGH TO USE IT. ALMOST AS CLEVER AS WHAT  I HAVE IN STORE FOR ARINA. DAR. I'D LIKE TO BRING  YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SWORDS ABOVE YOUR FRIEND  AND THE ROPE WHICH HOLDS THEM. IT'S A STURDY ROPE --  THE FLAME MIGHT TAKE ALL DAY TO CONSUME IT -- WHO KNOWS? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? AND BECAUSE I FINALLY HAVE  A WAY OF MAKING YOU USE YOUR POWERS TO MY ADVANTAGE. AS QUICK AND AS BRAVE  AS YOU ARE, ALL OF US BEFORE  SOMEONE SEVERS THAT ROPE. THEY HAVE EXPLICIT  ORDERS TO CUT IT AS SOON AS THEY FEEL THREATENED. WHAT DO YOU WANT? AN ALLY. TURN ZAD'S ELEPHANTS AROUND. I DON'T CONTROL THE ELEPHANTS. PERSUADE THEM, BEG THEM, CAJOLE. IT REALLY MAKES NO DIFFERENCE  TO ME HOW YOU DO IT. DAR, FORGET ABOUT ME. SAVE TAO. MAYBE THIS IS MY FATE. NOW I CAN JOIN  ORPHEO WITH HONOUR, TAKING SOMETHING  WITH ME THAT'S HIS. IF SHE DIES,  I'LL HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE. YOU GOT HERE FASTER  THAN I EXPECTED. YOU'D WANT TO BE QUICKER  GETTING BACK TO THE ELEPHANTS. SEE TO IT THAT NO ONE STANDS IN HIS WAY. HMM, SO YOU JOINED THE WARRIORS  WHEN YOUR FAMILY'S CROPS WERE BURNT AND YOU HAD TO EAT. AND YOU...YOU WERE TRAINED  AS A CHILD TO FIGHT AGAINST THE TERRONS,  AND NOW YOU FIGHT WITH ZAD. THAT'S INTERESTING. YOU BOTH HAVE  INTERESTING STORIES. WOULD YOU MIND JUST DROPPING  THESE SPEARS A BIT SO THAT I CAN BREATHE? YOU'RE RELIEVED. WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOUR MAYBE, OR MAYBE HE'LL APPEAR  WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT. WE'LL SEE --  IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE OTHER SCORES TO SETTLE. BE PREPARED TO MOVE OUT. WE MARCH ON XINCA AT MY COMMAND. SO, HOW ABOUT YOU FELLOWS? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? BRING THAT TO ME. I'VE CONFINED THE CIVILIANS  TO THEIR HOMES. IF THE ROPES DON'T LET LOOSE  SOON, SHE'LL DIE OF THIRST. EITHER WAY,  SHE WON'T LAST THE DAY. THAT WILL BE  LONG ENOUGH. TODAY IS THE  DAY OF RECKONING. OUR SCOUTS SAY  ZAD IS COMING. YOU THINK THE BEASTMASTER  WILL STOP THE ELEPHANTS? TWO RULES OF WAR:  ASSUME NOTHING AND LEAVE NOTHING  TO CHANCE. BUT OUR MEN HAVE NEVER  FOUGHT ELEPHANTS BEFORE. OUR ARCHERS WILL  TAKE CARE OF THAT. ELEPHANT SKIN CAN'T  BE ANY TOUGHER TRIES TODAY, WE'RE STRONGER  AND WE'RE SMARTER, HJALMAR. WE'LL RID OURSELVES  OF MANY ENEMIES TODAY. TO YOUR TOWERS  AND KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN. YES, MILORD. STILL NO BEASTMASTER. LOOKS LIKE OUR VICTORY  WILL SOON BE HERE. DON'T BE SO SURE.  THE DAY IS LONG. NOT FOR YOU. ONCE WE'VE GOT THE CITY,  WE'LL SOUND THE HORNS. YES, KING ZAD. KILL YOUR PRISONER. YOU PROMISED DAR  THAT YOU WOULD SET ME FREE IF HE  DID NOT INTERFERE. HE'LL HUNT YOU  FOR THE REST OF YOUR  LIFE FOR THIS. HO, HO, HO, YOU FORGET, TAO. HE'S A MAN WHO DOESN'T KILL. UP TILL NOW, HE'S BEEN  A CONSTANT TORMENT. BUT ONCE I HAVE XINCA AND THESE  WARRIORS GUARD THE WALLS, HE'LL BE NO MORE THAN A MINOR  NUISANCE TO BE IGNORED. THE HORNS. VODEN'S READY FOR YOU. HE HAS WEAPONS TO DEFEAT  THE ELEPHANTS. NOTHING CAN STOP MY ELEPHANTS. POWERFUL ARROWS  THAT WILL PIERCE THEIR HIDES. THEY HAVE ONLY  TO BREACH THE WALLS. ONCE WE'RE INSIDE, I HAVE ANOTHER  SURPRISE IN STORE. I'VE GROWN VERY FOND  OF THESE BEASTS. IT WOULD DISPLEASE ME  TO SEE THEM HURT. I HAVEN'T COME ALL THIS WAY  TO BE DENIED VODEN. I WANT TO FEEL MY SWORD SINK DEEP  INTO THAT WHITE MAGGOT. VODEN LIVES INSIDE HIS OWN HEAD. FOR HIM,  THE SPIRITS DON'T EXIST. EVEN YOU DON'T EXIST. NOW WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT, CAN WE? SO, YOU SEE? YOU MUST HELP ME. [ SHOUTING ] [ SHOUTING ] I TOLD YOU NOT TO  COME BACK FOR ME. I'D NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. TAO AND THE ELEPHANTS  NEED OUR HELP. KILL THEM. DON'T LET THEM  ESCAPE. AFTER THEM! YES, MILORD. CLOSE THE GATES. CLOSE THE GATES. ARCHERS TO THEIR POSTS. PREPARE FOR BATTLE. PREPARE  FOR BATTLE. ARCHERS ON THE READY! -WHERE DOES THIS FOG COME FROM?  -THEY'RE COMING. WHERE ARE THE ELEPHANTS?  I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. ARCHERS, FIRE THEIR ARROWS! THERE'S TOO MUCH FOG! WE NEED TO REINFORCE THE GATE.  COME ON. COME ON! BRACE IT THERE. COME ON, MORE REINFORCEMENTS. COME ON. [ SHOUTING ] KILL THEM ALL! FALL BACK, FALL BACK! FALL BACK! COME ON, THIS WAY. WE GOT TO  GET TO TAO. ELEPHANTS FIRST --  ZAD WON'T HARM TAO UNTIL HE'S SURE  HE'S TAKEN THE CITY. -YOU ALL RIGHT?  -BETTER NOW. THEY KNOW WHERE TAO IS. GET ON. [ SHOUTING ] [ TRUMPETING ] THANK YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? REGROUP. MOUNT A COUNTERATTACK. THERE'LL BE NO COUNTERATTACK. IT SEEMS I'VE OVERLOOKED  THE FIRST RULE OF WAR. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE YOUR ENEMY. IF HE BROKE THROUGH THE WALLS OF XINCA, I'D DELIVER HIM THE CITY. AND I'D DELIVER YOU AS WELL. YOU DID THIS WHEN  SCOUTING HIS ARMY? ARINA ALMOST RUINED OUR MEETING. YOU'D RATHER SERVE  A MURDERING SAVAGE WHO ONLY THINKS WITH HIS GUT  AND HIS GROIN THAN ME? AT LEAST HE'S AN EVIL  I CAN UNDERSTAND... AND NOT A COMPLETE MADMAN. YOU WORTHLESS TRAITOR. GET HIM OUT OF MY SIGHT. AFTER HIM. GO, GO. FIND THE BRAT'S  TENT -- HJALMAR'S NOT HAVING THE SOLE PLEASURE  OF SKINNING HIM ALIVE. HELP ME... SOUND THE VICTORY SIGNAL. XINCA'S OURS. [ CHEERING ] [ HORN BLARING ] THAT CAN'T BE  THE VICTORY SIGNAL. I EXPECTED MORE THAN THAT,  WITH ELEPHANTS AND TRUMPETS AND FANFARE  THE WHOLE...EVERY-- ARE YOU SURE WE  CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS? THIS IS A SHAME BECAUSE  WE'RE BECOMING SUCH GOOD FRIENDS  AND EVERYTHING AND... WE'LL EACH HAVE TO TAKE TWO  AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME. IS THAT ALL? IF I COULD HAVE  JUST A MOMENT. BEFORE AN EIRON DIES, AN EIRON  WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT-- [ ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING ] HEY! YEAH, FINE. I CAN'T SAY  THE SAME ABOUT THE SHIRT. ZAD WON? I DON'T MEAN TO COMPLAIN,  BUT WEREN'T YOU CUTTING THAT A LITTLE BIT CLOSE? HE WOULD HAVE  BEEN HERE SOONER, BUT I HELD HIM UP. HAD TO HELP THE ELEPHANTS. THOUGHT YOU'D UNDERSTAND. YEAH, IN A FUNNY WAY, I DO. [ TRUMPETING ] GOOD. I KNEW YOU WOULD. IT'S ALL ABOUT  THE ELEPHANTS NOW. WHERE IS HE? WE CAN'T FIND HIM. YOU CAN'T FIND HIM? I'VE MEN SEARCHING  EVERY CORNER OF THE CITY. WE HAD A DEAL. YOU WERE TO DELIVER VODEN TO ME -- WE HAD A DEAL! HE'LL BE FOUND. THE CITY BELONGS TO YOU. ALL THOSE LOYAL TO VODEN ARE DEAD. HAIL KING ZAD! HAIL KING ZAD! WE WERE PLEASED TO HELP YOU IN YOUR VICTORY. AND HOW DO I REWARD SUCH FAITHFUL SERVICE? I'D BE GRATEFUL FOR WHATEVER  HONOUR YOU SAW FIT TO BESTOW. YOU ASK FOR NOTHING. I BELIEVE A LEADER SHOULD BE  STRONG AND UNQUESTIONED. VODEN HAD US ALL  DOUBTING THE FUTURE. I SAW YOU HAD THE STRENGTH  TO BE A GREATER KING. VERY PERCEPTIVE. WHAT HAPPENS IF ANOTHER LEADER  SHOULD COME ALONG. OUR LOYALTY IS TO YOU. [ CHUCKLING ] HOW CAN I BE SURE? HOW CAN I BE SURE? I SWEAR. OH, NO, DON'T SWEAR. FIND ME VODEN OR FOLLOW  YOUR GENERAL TO YOUR DEATHS. TAKE THAT WITH YOU. CHECK THERE. NOW ZAD RULES IN XINCA. ONE DESPOT  FOLLOWS ANOTHER. AND THIS ONE'S AS  BAD, IF NOT WORSE, THAN THE ONE BEFORE. NO, THE ELEPHANTS  ARE FREE, AND THE LAND SUFFERS FROM  ONE LESS TYRANT. IT'S A CHANGE  FOR THE BETTER. THERE'S STILL A MAD KING  SOMEWHERE OUT THERE WAITING TO MAKE  OUR LIVES MISERABLE. AS LONG AS THERE'S CHANGE FOR THE BETTER, ALL OF US STILL HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE. [ ELEPHANTS TRUMPETING ] CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
