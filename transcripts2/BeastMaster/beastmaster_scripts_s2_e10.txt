 WHY WOULD ANYONE  WANT TO KILL THEM? FOR FUN, FOR SPORT, FOR AS MANY REASONS AS HUMANS CAN CONTRIVE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THESE HUMANS. ARE THEY SPECIAL? THEY THINK THEY ARE. NOT SINCE THEY STARTED  WALKING ON THEIR HIND LEGS. THEY KNOW TOO MUCH NOW. IT MAKES THEM NERVOUS. ABOUT THE FACT THAT  THEY'RE ALL BORN TO DIE... AND THERE'S NOT VERY MUCH THEY CAN DO ABOUT THAT. THIS ONE DOESN'T  LOOK NERVOUS. THIS ONE ISN'T NERVOUS ENOUGH. DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE  FOUND TAO'S ROCKS. ARE YOU SURE THESE ARE THE RIGHT ROCKS? TAO'S VERY PARTICULAR  ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS. [ CAWING ] IF YOU HUNT FOR FOOD,  HUNT SOMETHING ELSE. THIS ANIMAL'S ALMOST EXTINCT. I DON'T HUNT FOR FOOD. THAT MONSTER KILLED  MY WIFE AND CHILDREN. I HUNT FOR VENGEANCE. STEP ASIDE... OR YOU'LL DIE WITH HIM. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... I WILL KILL YOU  IF YOU DON'T MOVE. LOOK, I'M SORRY  ABOUT YOUR FAMILY. IT'S CALLED A TASMANIAN TIGER,  IT WOULD NEVER ATTACK A HUMAN. NEVER ATTACK? LOOK AT IT! IT'S AN UGLY VICIOUS KILLER. ITS LOOK IS NOT ITS NATURE. HE SAYS HE DIDN'T ATTACK YOUR FAMILY --  HE SAYS HE DIDN'T DO IT. HE SAYS? AHHH! GO QUICK! NO! UNTIE ME. UNTIE ME! TELL ME YOUR NAME. KALEB, SON OF SHAN. A NEANDO HUNTER -- YOU'RE A LONG THE NEANDO HAVE GROWN  TOO FEW TO HAVE ANY LANDS. SO WHAT GAME DO YOU HUNT? HE'S TRACKING A TASMANIAN TIGER. THYLACINE? THEY'RE EXTINCT. NOT QUITE. WE SAW ONE TODAY. DIDN'T WE -- HE SAYS  IT KILLED HIS FAMILY. THE ANIMAL SAID  HE DIDN'T-- "THE ANIMAL SAID." DON'T SCOFF.  HE'S THE BEASTMASTER. HE COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS,  BIRDS, EVEN SOME HUMANS, TOO. AND ANIMALS DON'T LIE. IT'S NOT IN THEIR NATURE. ONLY HUMANS HAVE THAT ABILITY, OR DISABILITY, DEPENDING  ON YOUR POINT OF VIEW-- I ALSO KNOW ANIMALS. THEY GIVE ME FOOD AND SHELTER,  AND I HONOUR THEM FOR THAT. BUT I KNOW THEY WILL  DO ANYTHING TO SURVIVE. KALEB, TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. I'D BEEN AWAY FROM HOME  FOR THREE DAYS. THE HUNTING HAD BEEN GOOD. BUT I COULDN'T WAIT TO BE BACK  WITH MY WIFE AND MY CHILDREN. USUALLY, MY CHILDREN  WOULD CLIMB A TREE, SO THEY COULD SEE ME COMING  AND RUN TO GREET ME. BUT THIS TIME... THIS TIME THERE WAS NO ONE. AHH! NO! ALL OF THEM... THROATS TORN OPEN... BLED WHITE. I SAW NO KNIFE -- JUST DEATH  AND THAT DEVIL DOG. WHAT WOULD YOU DO  IN MY PLACE, BEASTMASTER? HE COULD BE  TELLING THE TRUTH. OR THE TRUTH AS HE KNOWS IT. THE ANIMAL WASN'T LYING. IT CAN'T. KEEP HIM HERE TILL I GET BACK. [ COUGHING ] WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH ALL  THESE ROCKS? I'M GLAD YOU ASKED --  NORD WEAPONS ARE MADE FROM COPPER  AND CASSERITE ROCK. I DON'T HAVE THOSE ROCKS,  BUT I'M WORKING ON A THEORY THAT, IF YOU COMBINE  THE RIGHT ELEMENTS, YOU'LL HAVE A WEAPON  AS STRONG AS THEIRS. I DON'T NEED IT. BUT YOU'VE SEEN  WHAT THEIR SWORDS CAN DO. TAO... KNOWING THE WAY OF THINGS,  AND MOVING WITH THEM, IS WHAT KEEPS ME ALIVE. YES... BUT THIS WILL HELP. BY THE TIME YOU GET BACK, I'LL HAVE A NEW WEAPON  WAITING FOR YOU. JUST FOR THE MOMENT... I'M ALSO WORKING  ON A THEORY THAT... NOT ALL ELEMENTS  CAN BE COMBINED. [ HOWLING ] SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. IF YOU WANT HER, SHE'S YOURS. THOUGHT YOU WERE  GOING TO KILL THEM. THAT'S THE PLAN,  ISN'T IT? THAT'S UP TO THE BEASTMASTER. HE IGNORES  MY INVITATIONS TO MEET. DENIES ME AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. NOW HE'LL DISCOVER HOW COSTLY  HIS LACK OF MANNERS CAN BE. AND YOU'RE SURE HE'LL COME? OH, HE CAN HEAR THEIR SUFFERING. HE WON'T BE ABLE  TO BEAR IT FOR THAT LONG. HE'LL TRY TO RESCUE THEM. [ GROWLING AND SNARLING ] LOOK AT HER EYES. THERE'S NOTHING SHE WON'T DO  TO DEFEND HERSELF. IMAGINE, AN ARMY  OF THESE CREATURES ATTACKING OUR ENEMIES. IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE  THE BRAVEST BLOOD RUN COLD. AND HOW  DO YOU KNOW HE WON'T SEND  THEM AGAINST US? HE CLAIMS THEY'RE NOT WARRIORS. PROTECTS THEM LIKE A FATHER  PROTECTS HIS CHILDREN. NO, HE WON'T TRADE  THEIR LIVES FOR HIS. HE'LL COME...BUT THIS TIME,  HE'LL HAVE TO TALK TO ME. HARDLY A MAN AND  HE'S CONQUERED A DOZEN LANDS, WIPED OUT COUNTLESS TRIBES. WHY? OH...AMBITION, FOCUS. IT'S SOMETHING I ADMIRE  IN A YOUNG PERSON. PERHAPS THE BEASTMASTER  HAS FINALLY MET HIS MATCH. WHAT DOES VODEN WANT  FROM THE BEASTMASTER? HIS HELP TO CONTROL THE ANIMALS. BUT THE BEASTMASTER WON'T  JUST GIVE HIM WHAT HE WANTS. IT'S NOT HIS TO GIVE. HE WAS GRANTED  THAT GIFT BY THE DEMON OF COURSE, VODEN WOULD  NEVER BELIEVE THAT. SO VODEN WILL KILL HIM. YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT  THE BEASTMASTER? ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING OF THESE HUMANS SEEM TERRIFIED  OF THINGS THEY CAN'T CONTROL. BUT THE BEASTMASTER  ISN'T TERRIFIED AT ALL. YOU CAN SEE THAT RIGHT AWAY, AND HE MAKES  OTHERS FEEL SAFE. WITHOUT HIM AROUND, THEY'LL JUST KILL EVERY ANIMAL  IN SIGHT, WON'T THEY? QUITE POSSIBLY. AND WHAT WILL THEY DO THEN? REGRET THEIR  STUPIDITY, ALL TOO LATE. IT'S A COMMON  HUMAN TRAIT. IS THE TASMANIAN TIGER  TRULY THE LAST OF THE SPECIES? YES. NOT USEFUL TO HUMANS, OR CUTE, LIKE YOUR WOLF PUP. BUT HE IS BEAUTIFUL. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE LIKE HIM. ANOTHER LESSON LEARNED. AND HERE'S ONE MORE: HUMANS ARE NOT LIKE YOU. IF IT WASN'T YOU, THEN WHO? WHO WOULD KILL  AN INNOCENT FAMILY? STAY HERE. MY FRIEND RUH  WILL TO PROTECT YOU. CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION? DO I HAVE A CHOICE? I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. YOUR WORDS...MEAN NOTHING. THEN MAYBE I CHOSE  THE WRONG ONES. MY CITY AND MY PEOPLE WERE OVERRUN BY A CULT  OF BLOODTHIRSTY PRIESTS. SO WE TOO ARE  AN ENDANGERED SPECIES. I UNDERSTAND KILLING WON'T  BRING THE DEAD BACK TO LIFE. IT WILL HELP THEIR  SPIRITS FIND PEACE. THEIRS OR YOURS? MY FATHER LOVED TO CARVE. HE HAD...GRACEFUL FINGERS  AND HE WAS VERY PATIENT. I TAKE THIS WITH ME  TO REMIND ME OF HIM. IT DOESN'T TAKE AWAY THE PAIN OF NOT KNOWING HIS FATE,  BUT IT HELPS. THE CARVING IS OF HIS MOTHER. SHE USED TO LOVE FETCHING  WATER DOWN AT THE WELL. THAT'S WHERE  SHE MET HER FRIENDS. NOW, WHEN SHE DIED, HE REBUILT THE WELL, SO THAT WHEN WE WENT DOWN THERE,  WE COULD REMEMBER HER. THAT WAS...THAT WAS GOOD. YES, IT WAS. WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS  OF DEALING WITH GRIEF, BUT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT FINDING OUR OWN WAYS TO RECEIVE COMFORT. MY WIFE HAD A GARDEN. IT WAS FULL  OF BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS. I DON'T KNOW HOW  TO PLANT A GARDEN. I DO, AND I  COULD SHOW YOU. I COULD UNBIND YOU.  WE COULD GATHER SEEDS. BUT FIRST, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE TO SPARE THE THYLACINE. HMM... THE FIRST THING  THAT WE HAVE TO DO-- YOU PLANT THAT GARDEN. BUT I WILL WATER IT WITH THE BLOOD OF THAT MONSTER. IF YOU, OR ANYONE ELSE,  TRIES TO STOP ME... I WILL KILL YOU. STUPID, STUPID. [ CAWING ] [ GROWLING ] LOOK OUT! TIGER! THE BEASTMASTER'S PET. NOW HE HAS NO CHOICE  BUT TO BOW TO MY WILL. THE BEAST IS MINE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT BEAST IS MINE. NO -- THEY'RE ALL MINE... AND SO ARE YOU. WHERE'D YOU GO, KALEB? WHERE WOULD I GO IF I WERE YOU? CASSERITE ROCK. THAT WAS EASY. DAR...CASSERITE ROCK. HOW'D THE HUNTER ESCAPE? I THOUGHT I'D CONVINCED HIM THAT KILLING THE THYLACINE  WAS A BAD IDEA. YEAH, WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. THE NORDS KILLED HIS FAMILY. -SWORD POINT.  -YEAH. WE MUST SHOW  THIS TO CALEB. THEY'VE TAKEN HIM PRISONER, ALONG WITH RUH  AND THE TASMANIAN TIGER. SHARAK SHOWED ME.  THEY'RE IN CAGES. AND NOW YOU WILL TRY TO RESCUE THEM AND VODEN WILL CAPTURE YOU. YOU KNOW  THEY'RE BAIT. I KNOW. I HAVE NO CHOICE. DAR, YOU CAN'T GO TO XINCA.  VODEN'S WHOLE ARMY'S THERE. THERE'S TOO MANY OF THEM.  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? FIGHT NORD SOLDIERS  USING FERRETS AND A STAFF MADE OF BONE? THEY'LL CUT YOU TO SHREDS. HE'S PERFECT. IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO  COMMUNICATE WITH HIM. I CAN'T WAIT TO LEARN  YOUR MASTER'S SECRETS. HE DOESN'T REALIZE HOW POWERFUL THEY COULD BE  IN THE RIGHT HANDS. [ CLANGING ] THERE'S SO MANY THINGS  I COULD DO WITH YOUR COURAGE AND STRENGTH. THE ENERGY YOU ONLY USE TO HUNT AND ROAM COULD BE FOCUSED  TO ENSLAVE THE WORLD. NOW GO AND MAKE TAO PROUD. MAKE THE BIGGEST MESS YOU CAN. YOU'RE NEANDO. I THOUGHT THE TERRONS  HAD WIPED OUT YOUR TRIBE. I AM THE LAST. VODEN SAYS YOU WANT TO KILL  THE TASMANIAN TIGER. HE MAY ALSO BE THE LAST  OF HIS BLOOD. THERE'S NOT MUCH MEAT  ON HIS BONES, WHY BOTHER? THE BEAST KILLED MY  WIFE AND CHILDREN. THEIR SPIRITS  CANNOT REST UNTIL IT IS DEAD. I'M SORRY. MY I ASK YOUR NAME? MY NAME IS KALEB. THESE FORESTS ARE GUARDED  BY THE BEASTMASTER. I'M SURPRISED HE DIDN'T  STOP YOUR HUNT. HE TRIED. HE EVEN HELD ME  CAPTIVE AT HIS CAMP, BUT I ESCAPED. YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS. TELL ME AND I CAN  GET YOU OUT OF HERE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA MUCH BLOOD WILL FLOW IF THE  BEASTMASTER DOES NOT COME. UGLY, ISN'T HE? HE SAYS THE TASMANIAN TIGER WHY WASN'T HE THERE  TO PROTECT THEM HIMSELF? [ GRUNTING ] I'M SURPRISED WE DIDN'T  FIND HIM IN OUR NETS. HE LOOKS PART BEAST HIMSELF. PERHAPS HE CAN ENTERTAIN US  WITH THE OTHER ANIMALS, WHILST WE AWAIT THE BEASTMASTER. HE CLAIMS TO KNOW WHERE THE  BEATMASTER IS. HE COULD  TAKE US TO HIM. NO, ARINA, I'M FINISHED  TRAMPING THESE FORESTS. THIS TIME THE BEASTMASTER  WILL COME TO US. THROW HIM INTO THE PIT  WITH THE BEAST HE HUNTS. IT HAS TO EAT...  AND WE CAN WATCH. [ BARKING ] FIRE! THIS IS HIS WORK. HE'S NEAR. YOU TWO, FOLLOW ME! GET THE MEN! WE NEED MORE WATER NOW! YOU'LL NEVER SET THEM  FREE BY YOURSELF. LET ME HELP YOU. COME ON, HE'S GETTING AWAY! THE PRISONER! RUN! WE CAN SLOW DOWN NOW. I THINK THEY'RE  FAR BEHIND. WHICH WAY NOW? MY CAMP'S ACROSS THE RIVER. I'M SORRY, BEASTMASTER. I'VE SOMETHING TO FINISH FIRST. DAR. I KNOW IT SMELLS, BUT IT'LL TAKE THE POUNDING OUT OF YOUR HEAD. I WISH I HAD SOME HERBS  TO HEAL YOUR STAFF. BUT I MIGHT HAVE  SOMETHING BETTER. BUT THAT'S NOT MUCH BETTER  THAN MY BROKEN STAFF. WELL, YOU HAVEN'T TRIED IT YET. ROCKS, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF EACH ELEMENT TO COMBINE. IT'S A LITTLE MORE  DIFFICULT THAN I THOUGHT. TAO... WAS PASSED TO ME  ACROSS GENERATIONS. THE HISTORY OF MY PEOPLE  IS WRITTEN ON IT. THAT'S JUST...  SOMETHING TO KILL WITH. SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW? WELL, I'M CERTAIN  KALEB'S GONE BACK FOR THE TASMANIAN TIGER. AND I KNOW THAT  VODEN STILL HAS RUH, SO AT FIRST LIGHT WE'LL GO BACK AND GET THEM BEFORE THEY'RE KILLED. DAR, YOU'RE UNARMED.  IF YOU GO BACK IN THERE, -YOU'LL BE KILLED.  -IT DOESN'T MATTER. SEE, CURUPIRA GAVE ME A DUTY. AND IF I FAIL, THE TASMANIAN TIGER-- THE TASMANIAN TIGER WON'T  BE THE ONLY ANIMAL TO DISAPPEAR FROM THE FORESTS. TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU SEE IN HIM? I LIKE WHAT HE DOES. AND WHAT DOES HE DO? HE LOOKS AFTER THINGS. HE KEEPS THINGS SAFE. WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT THE  BALANCE OF POWER YET, HAVE WE? HAS SOMETHING GONE  OUT OF BALANCE? NOT YET, BUT HERE...  I'VE GOT A GIFT FOR YOU. WHAT IS IT? AREN'T YOU GOING TO THANK ME? WELL, YOU THROW IT AWAY...  AND IT COMES BACK TO YOU. AH, LIKE A WOLF PUP  WITH A STICK? OR, LIKE A PROBLEM ONE TRIES TO AVOID. -SHALL WE TRY IT?  -YEAH. YOUR BEASTMASTER  IS ALREADY ON HIS PATH. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING  YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT. YOU THINK WE  HAVE NO CHOICES. OH, WE HAVE CHOICES; THEY DON'T. AND THOSE HE PROTECTS  HAVE NO CHOICES EITHER? THE ANIMALS? YES. WHY COMPLICATE THINGS? THEY ARE COMPLICATED. I HELPED HIS FRIEND FIND SOMETHING TO RETURN THE BALANCE. ONCE THE BEASTMASTER  HAS A REAL WEAPON, HE CAN FIGHT OFF ANOTHER MORTAL WHO WISHES TO TIP THE BALANCE. THERE'S A SAYING, "SOW THE WIND, REAP THE WHIRLWIND." IT MEANS-- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WHAT YOU DO RETURNS  TO HAUNT YOU. PRECISELY. I WISH YOU'D WAIT UNTIL  I FIGURED SOMETHING OUT. IT'S TOO DANGEROUS. WE CAN'T  WALK INTO THE CAMP UNARMED. WE WON'T BE UNARMED. LOOK, I UNDERSTAND I'M  NOT NEARLY AS USEFUL AS A COUPLE OF FERRETS. I DIDN'T SAY THAT. YOU WON'T LET ME GIVE YOU  SOMETHING TO PROTECT YOU. JUST LET ME GO AS FAR AS WHERE  I FOUND THE CASSERITE ROCK. [ HOWLING ] YES! CALL FOR HIM! TELL HIM THE KILLING HAS BEGUN! PREPARE THE ARENA! IT'S TIME! [ CHEERING ] [ CHEERING ] WHY DID YOU COME BACK...WHY? I'VE TOLD YOU WHY. I'D HEARD THAT  THE NEANDO HAD NO FEAR. MAYBE THAT'S WHY THERE  ARE SO FEW OF YOU. OH, WE KNOW FEAR. THEN LEAVE WHILE YOU CAN. YOUR VENGEANCE WILL  COST YOU YOUR LIFE. IF THEY CATCH YOU,  YOU WILL DIE IN THAT PIT. I AM DEAD ALREADY. I'M THE LAST OF MY BLOOD LINE. WHEN YOU HAVE LOST  EVERYTHING YOU HOLD DEAR, THERE'S NOTHING  MORE TO BE AFRAID OF. BUT IF I CAN KILL THAT DEVIL  DOG, I WILL DIE AT PEACE. I KNEW VENGEANCE ONCE. I SWORE A BLOOD OATH AGAINST KING ZAD AND THE TERRONS. I MADE ANY ENEMY  OF THEIRS MY FRIEND. AND YOU TASTED JOY  IN HIS DEFEAT. THAT JOY WAS SHORT-LIVED,  AND THE PRICE FOR IT WAS HIGH. I AM NOW BOUND  TO A GREATER DARKNESS. GO BEFORE YOU-- YOU SHOULD COMMEND YOUR TRACKER, EVEN A HUNTER LIKE ME  COULDN'T ESCAPE HER SKILLS. HE CAME BACK TO KILL  THE TASMANIAN TIGER. I DECIDE WHO LIVES OR DIES. BRING HIM. COME ON. THIS IS WHERE YOU STOP --  IF EVERYTHING GOES TO PLAN, I'LL BE BACK AT THE  CAMPSITE BY NIGHTFALL. IF THE ANIMALS COME BACK,  AND I'M NOT WITH THEM, DON'T TRY AND SAVE ME. I'LL HAVE TOLD  THEM NOT TO RETURN. [ YELLING ] TAKE THAT ROPE OFF HIM! I DON'T WANT TO SEE ALL  THESE BEAUTIFUL CREATURES DIE. THE LAST ONE LEFT ALIVE, MAN OR BEAST, WILL GO FREE! [ CHEERING ] WITH THESE YOU'RE EQUAL  TO ITS TOOTH AND CLAW. MAY THE BEST BEAST WIN! ARGH! YEAH! KALEB, STOP! GET OUT OF MY WAY. ONE MORE BLOW AND THAT  THING IS FINISHED! THE NORDS KILLED YOUR FAMILY. WAIT. LET'S SEE SOME BLOOD  BEFORE YOU SEIZE HIM. HERE'S THE PROOF. LIAR! TAKE THE OTHER ANIMALS AND GO. -THE ANIMALS ARE ESCAPING.  -FORGET THEM. I HAVE WHAT I WANT. BRING THE BEASTMASTER TO ME. ARGH! WHERE'S DAR? WHAT HAPPENED? WE HAVE TO GO!  WE HAVE TO FIND HIM! HE SAID NOT TO COME FOR HIM. WHO ARE YOU? A FRIEND. I SAW YOU IN THE FOREST WHEN I FOUND THE  CASSERITE ROCK. OR TO BE MORE ACCURATE,  WHEN I FOUND IT FOR YOU. THERE, DONE. NOW, TAKE IT TO HIM BEFORE  ANY OF THE ANIMALS DIE. IT'S AS GOOD AS NEW. -BETTER.  -WHAT DID YOU DO TO IT? I HELPED...NOW GO. AND TELL HIM NOT TO FORGET  THE MOTHER WOLF. HER PUP IS WAITING. THIS ANIMAL IS PRECIOUS TO YOU. IS IT ONE OF YOUR PETS? I DON'T HAVE PETS. HIS SPECIES HAS BEEN HUNTED  TO THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION. THAT MAKES HIM PRECIOUS. HOW DO YOU MAKE THEM OBEY? I DON'T...WE'RE FRIENDS. I SAW YOU TELL YOUR TIGER TO-- NO, I ASKED. AND SOMETIMES HE DOES AS I ASK. YOU SEE, ANIMALS  AREN'T MY SERVANTS. THEY WEREN'T MEANT TO BE  SERVANTS TO ANYONE. AND THIS ONE...HAS BEEN  HUNTED FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN MAN HAS NO USE FOR HIM. THEN GIVE THEM A PURPOSE. COMMAND THEM  TO WIN US AN EMPIRE. I JUST TOLD YOU...  I DON'T COMMAND THEM. DON'T YOU SEE? I HAVE THE WEAPONS, THE ARMY. YOU COULD COMMAND  THE GREAT BEASTS, THE HAWKS, THE SNAKES  WITH THEIR VENOM. NOTHING COULD STOP US. WE COULD CONTROL THE WORLD. WHY WOULD I WANT TO? WHY WOULD ANYONE? BECAUSE THERE ARE ONLY  TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE: VICTORS AND VICTIMS. AND IF THE VICTIMS CAN'T  DEFEND THEMSELVES; THEY DESERVE TO BE EXTINCT. YOU KNOW, YOU AND I  ARE VERY DIFFERENT. I SEE ALL LIFE AS A FAMILY, WHERE EVERYONE DEPENDS  ON EVERYONE ELSE... AND EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED. I SEE IT AS THE BATTLE  FOR SURVIVAL THAT IT IS. EAT OR BE EATEN.  ASK YOUR ANIMAL FRIENDS. THEY'LL TELL YOU HOW THEY LIVE. PLEASE, I DON'T THINK SO.  I RESPECT MY FRIENDS. IS THE TASMANIAN TIGER DEAD? THE BEASTMASTER'S  TAKING CARE OF HIM. YOU NEED TO BIND THAT CUT. I THINK YOUR KING WOULD  RATHER I BLED TO DEATH. HERE. WHERE DID YOU GET THIS? VODEN GAVE IT TO ME. WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S WRONG? THIS BELONGED TO MY WIFE. THE BEASTMASTER WAS RIGHT. IT WASN'T THE ANIMAL. IT WAS HIS SOLDIERS. WHAT DO YOU WANT? HE'S GOT SOMETHING ELSE TO SLAY. COME ON. [ YELLING ] I HAVE GOOD NEWS, HUNTER. YOU CAN KILL YOUR DEVIL DOG. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS KILL HIM FIRST. HERE. HE'S A MAN OF NATURE, SO I'M LETTING HIM USE  HIS BARE HANDS. MY OFFER STILL STANDS,  BEASTMASTER. JUST SAY THE WORD. YOU LIVE, HE LIVES,  THE BEAST LIVES... YOU! YOU KILLED MY FAMILY! I WILL NOT FIGHT THIS MAN  FOR YOUR PLEASURE. PERHAPS YOU'D RATHER FIGHT ME. [ CHEERING ] THEY WILL NEVER LET  YOU SLAY THEIR KING. WHEN THIS STARTS, SAVE YOURSELF  AND THE TASMANIAN TIGER. TELL IT I'M SORRY  FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO IT. PERHAPS IT IS FITTING THAT  THE LAST OF ONE BLOOD DIES TO SAVE THE LAST OF ANOTHER. [ YELLING ] THIS IS MY FIGHT. YOU DON'T HATE HIM...I DO. THAT MAKES IT MY FIGHT. NOW I REMEMBER YOUR WIFE. WE THOUGHT SHE WAS  JUST ANOTHER ANIMAL. AND THOSE BRATS SCREAMING, "WHERE'S DADDY?" "WHY ISN'T HE HERE TO SAVE US?" AHH! MY OFFER STILL STANDS, BEASTMASTER. -ALL RIGHT.  -DAR! I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING. OPEN THE CAGES, TAO. KILL HIM. GO! THAT WAY. THANK YOU. KILL THEM, KILL THEM ALL. KILL THE BEASTS! BEASTMASTER, YOU'LL REGRET THIS. NO ONE DEFIES ME, NO ONE. SO WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? AFTER MY FATHER MADE THE STAFF,  HE HARDENED IT IN FIRE. WHEN I CLAIMED IT, I WAS STANDING IN HIS ASHES. YOU SEE, THE SULAS BELIEVE  THAT FIRE RENEWS. BY DOING THIS,  I HONOUR MY FATHER. WOW... AT LEAST SOME WORLDS  LIVE ON. THIS IS AS FAR AS I GO  WITH YOU, BEASTMASTER. I NEED TO RETURN TO MY HOME. THOUGHT THERE WAS  NO HOME TO RETURN TO. MY MEMORIES ARE THERE  AND THE GARDEN. IT NEEDS PLANTING. [ WHIMPERING ] I THINK HE WANTS TO GO WITH YOU. AFTER WHAT I'VE DONE TO HIM? HE SEEKS NO VENGEANCE. HE JUST WANTS TO BE YOUR FRIEND. I THINK YOU TWO NEED EACH OTHER. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW? WELL, ONE DAY THERE  WILL ONLY BE ONE. AND SOMETIME AFTER THAT... NONE. PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND  THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL LIFE, ALL SPECIES OF ANIMAL,  ALL FORMS OF MAN. IF THEY DON'T, THERE'LL BE  NO FUTURE FOR ANY OF US. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
