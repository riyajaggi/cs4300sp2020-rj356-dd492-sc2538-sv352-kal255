  [ CHEERING ] [ GRUNTING ] [ CHEERING ] THE GAME IS HARD, KING ZAD,  BUT IT IS JUST. IS IT JUST FOR MEN TO DIE  FOR THE PLEASURE OF A MOB? MEN OFTEN DIE FOR  MUCH LESS, QUEEN NYOKA. AT LEAST THESE MEN HAVE A CHANCE TO CONTROL THEIR DESTINY. IN OTHER CITIES, CRIMINALS  ARE SIMPLY EXECUTED. IN CHALKA, WE ALLOW  THE GODS TO DECIDE. IT'S BRUTE FORCE  THAT DECIDES.

 BRUTE FORCE HAS ITS PLACE. THIS GAME INSTILLS THEY'RE THE ENVY OF ALL THOSE  WHO APPRECIATE TRUE GRIT. YEAH! TWO POINTS! YOUR CHAMPIONS ARE VICTORIOUS. THE GODS HAVE SPOKEN. SEEMS A SHAME TO SACRIFICE  SUCH FINE SPECIMENS. MEN LIKE THESE  WOULD ASSURE SUCCESS IN MY CAMPAIGN AGAINST VODEN. YOU HEAR THAT, NYOKA? KING ZAD WOULD USE  OUR DREGS FOR HIS ARMY. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY DIE  TO SERVE ANOTHER CAUSE. [ ROARING ]

 THEY AWAIT YOUR SIGNAL,  QUEEN NYOKA. OUT OF MY WAY, DAGAN. THESE MEN STOLE TIGERS  FROM THE ROYAL COMPOUND. YOU NEED TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE. NOMAR, SEE TO MY TIGERS. YES, YOUR HIGHNESS. THE LAWS OF CHALKA FORBID PARDONING THESE MEN. I WON'T SEND OTHERS  TO DIE IN YOUR WAR WITH VODEN. RECRUIT YOUR  WARRIORS ELSEWHERE. IF YOU ARE IN CHALKA  AFTER SUNSET, YOU MAY FIND  YOUR OWN GRIT TESTED. [ CHEERING ] IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... SORRY, RUH, THERE  WAS A STREAM HERE. MAYBE THERE'S SOME  WATER UP AHEAD. DAR, THAT'S NOT  A GOOD IDEA. ACCORDING TO MY  MAP, THIS RIVERBED LEADS ALL THE  WAY TO CHALKA. WHAT'S CHALKA? IT'S A...A PLACE  EIRONS TRY TO AVOID. IT'S ANOTHER CITY. THE PEOPLE OF CHALKA ARE  WAR-LIKE AND UNFRIENDLY. THE TOTAL OPPOSITE  TO THE PEOPLE OF XINCA. TAO, NO PEOPLE  ARE COMPLETELY UNFRIENDLY. DAR, TRUST ME. CHALKA IS DIFFERENT. WHERE'S HE GOING? HE DOESN'T CARE  WHICH WAY WE GO. HE JUST WANTS  A DRINK OF WATER. HE'LL CATCH UP. WELL...WHICH WAY  DO YOU WANT TO GO? I DON'T WANT TO SEE  ANOTHER CITY. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? NOW WE WAIT. QUEEN NYOKA WILL HAVE  HER NEW TIGERS SOON ENOUGH. GET HIM...KILL HIM! KINGS AND QUEENS OF CHALKA  RULE WITH AN IRON HAND. THEIR PEOPLE HAVE NO FREEDOM  OR JOY IN THEIR LIVES. WHAT IF YOU  GOT TO KNOW THEM? IT WOULDN'T BE ALLOWED.  THEY DON'T LIKE STRANGERS. THEY DON'T TRADE  OR SHARE KNOWLEDGE. THE ONLY THING THE PEOPLE  OF CHALKA EMBRACE IS CRUELTY. [ SHRIEKING ] RUH'S HURT. OH... THE QUEEN'S LOYAL  TIGER STEWARD. YOU'LL PAY DEARLY  FOR THIS, NOMAR, HA, HA... RUH! IT'S POISONED. HE'S STILL BREATHING -- THE POISON MUST HAVE BEEN MEANT TO KNOCK HIM OUT, NOT KILL HIM. SOMEONE WANTS  TO TAKE HIM ALIVE. CAREFUL, THEY MAY  STILL BE OUT THERE. I HOPE SO. [ SHRIEKING ] HELLO. DAR, LOOK! HE'S COMING TO. CAN HE TELL YOU ANYTHING? SOME MEN AMBUSHED HIM. THEY WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED, ONLY SOMEONE ELSE WARNED HIM IN TIME. -WHO?  -I DON'T KNOW. THEY'VE TAKEN HIM PRISONER. WHERE TO? TO THE FOOTHILLS. [ SIGHING ] CHALKA. TAO, HE SAVED RUH.  WE HAVE TO HELP HIM. WHAT ABOUT RUH? IF THEY'RE HUNTING TIGERS,  HE'LL BE SAFER HERE. SO WOULD WE... NOT THAT IT MAKES  ANY DIFFERENCE. MY QUEEN... WHAT IS IT NOW, DAGAN? I HAVE CAPTURED THE LAST OF THE MEN WHO RELEASED  YOUR SACRED TIGERS. HE AWAITS. WHAT IS IT? AN ICON. THE SYMBOL OF CHALKA. TIGERS ARE REVERED  IN THE CITY. THEN WHY DO THEY CAPTURE THEM? TO SHOW THE WORLD THEIR  POWER -- SEE, IT TELLS THEIR ENEMIES THAT IF THEIR  WARRIORS CAN SUBDUE TIGERS, SOMETHING ELSE YOU  SHOULD KNOW ABOUT CHALKA. PEOPLE TO HER OWN TIGERS  JUST TO KEEP THEM IN LINE. NOMAR? WE WERE HUNTING NEW TIGERS, WHEN HE HELPED  ONE OF THEM ESCAPE US. NOMAR, IS THIS TRUE? I HAD NO CHOICE. THE MAN YOU ENTRUSTED  WITH YOUR TIGERS BETRAYS THAT TRUST. YOU HELPED THE OTHERS FREE THE SACRED TIGERS, DIDN'T YOU? I KNEW THAT. THE TIGERS ARE UNHAPPY. THEY WHITHER AWAY IN DESPAIR, PREFERRING DEATH TO HAVING TO-- TO SERVING CHALKA? THE SACRED TIGERS ENSURE  THE SAFETY OF OUR CITY. AND THE RESPECT OF OUR QUEEN. THEY SHOW OTHERS THAT WE ARE STRONG! HOLDING THOSE TIGERS... MAKES OUR ENEMIES FEAR US. IF WE LOSE THE TIGERS, OH, THEY'RE ONLY ANIMALS.  THEY HAVE NO POWER-- SILENCE! I MEAN NO DISRESPECT MY QUEEN. BUT CAGING THOSE  TIGERS IS WRONG. NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU THINK. DAGAN. THE PUNISHMENT OF CRIMINALS FALLS TO MY OFFICE,  YOUR HIGHNESS. THE GAME AND THE GODS WILL DETERMINE HIS FATE! [ CHEERING ] HE IS RIGHT, NOMAR. OUR DUTY -- YOURS, MINE AND THE SACRED TIGERS -- IS TO THE WELFARE OF CHALKA. I'M SORRY. [ COUGHING AND SPITTING ] I CAN'T BELIEVE  WE'RE INSIDE THESE WALLS. BEING HERE MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL. ASKING THESE PEOPLE ONLY  MAKES THEM MORE SUSPICIOUS. YOUR FRIEND COUNSELS WISELY. IN CHALKA, THE SAFE COURSE  IS TO MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS. WE'RE LOOKING  FOR A MAN NOMAR, THE QUEEN'S STEWARD  OF THE SACRED TIGERS. NOMAR... YES...THEY'VE TAKEN HIM  TO WAIT HIS TURN AT THE GAME. WHAT GAME? I'VE HEARD OF THIS GAME. PLAYED BY CRIMINALS  IN THE ARENA. THE LOSERS ARE EXECUTED. SACRIFICED...TO  THE SACRED TIGERS. THE WINNERS LIVE, BUT ONLY TO FIGHT THE NEXT DAY, BUT AT LEAST THEY LIVE...  A LITTLE LONGER. WITH NO HOPE OF FREEDOM.  IT'S BABARIC! I WONDER IF YOU COULD  GET ANY LOUDER? THERE ARE EARS  EVERYWHERE IN CHALKA. TO SPEAK AGAINST THEIR WAYS IS THE QUICKEST WAY  TO PLAY THE GAME YOURSELF. WHO ARE YOU? THEY CALL ME BARZO. [ COUGHING ] WHATEVER YOU NEED BARZO CAN PROVIDE. FOOD, LODGING... WOMEN? INFORMATION. OHH...  THAT DEPENDS. ON WHAT? WHAT YOU  WANT TO KNOW... AND HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO PAY. AHHH! PERNICIOUS DEVIL! WOULD I COULD PLUCK YOU  FROM MY HEAD. YOU HAVE AN  INFECTED TOOTH. IT EXISTS ONLY TO TORTURE ME. HERE, CHEW THESE.  THEY DEADEN THE PAIN. FRESHEN THE BREATH. [ DAR ]: I DOUBT  THAT'S POSSIBLE. IF THIS WORKS, BARZO WILL HELP GET YOU  ANYTHING YOU DESIRE. I'VE NEVER SEEN  A MAN SO GRATIFIED BY A SIMPLE HERBAL REMEDY. IF BARZO'S TELLING THE TRUTH, THE CELLS SHOULD BE  BEHIND THIS COURTYARD. HE DIDN'T TELL US THERE'D  BE THIS MANY GUARDS. NOMAR SAVED RUH'S LIFE, TAO. IT DOESN'T MATTER  HOW MANY GUARDS THERE ARE. COME ON. WHY NOT?  THE MORE THE MERRIER. THE SACRED TIGERS OF CHALKA. THEY DON'T  LOOK VERY HAPPY. KEEP WATCH. I'LL TRY  TO FIND THE CELLS. WHAT ABOUT THEM? NOMAR FIRST. [ DOOR OPENING ] I'M SORRY, MY QUEEN.  I HEARD A DISTURBANCE. LEAVE US. THEY SEEM RESTLESS. NOMAR WAS THE ONLY ONE  WHO COULD CALM THEM WHEN -THEY GOT LIKE THIS.  -IS THAT WHY YOU WERE RELUCTANT TO SEND HIM  TO HIS PUNISHMENT? HE MAY HAVE BROKEN OUR LAWS, BUT HE DID WHAT HE DID  FROM COMPASSION. NYOKA...PERHAPS YOU COULD  SHOW SOME COMPASSION TO KING ZAD. HE WOULD MAKE  A POWERFUL FRIEND. KING ZAD'S ONLY FRIEND  IS HIMSELF. HE'D SEND OUR MEN  TO THEIR DEATHS FOR NOTHING  BUT HIS OWN VANITY. AND HE MAY NOT DEFEAT  VODEN WITHOUT THEM. THEN WE WOULD BE THE BOY KING'S  NEXT TARGET. I'M TIRED OF REIGNING  OVER SO MUCH DEATH. THE CROWN OF CHALKA  IS A HEAVY BURDEN. YOU KNOW YOU'VE ONLY  TO SAY THE WORD AND I WOULD GLADLY  SHARE YOUR TROUBLES. RID YOURSELF OF THAT FANTASY, DAGAN, YOU ARE MY ADVISOR. NOT MY CONSORT. I WAS ONLY  THINKING OF OUR PEOPLE. IF SOMETHING SHOULD  HAPPEN TO YOU-- IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN, YOUR FAMILY STANDS NEXT IN LINE. DON'T OVERSTEP YOUR PLACE AGAIN. HUMBLEST APOLOGIES. GUARDS....GUARDS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? -WHAT'S GOING ON?  -SILENCE. SEIZE HIM! THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. YOU'LL KILL US BOTH. WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS DAR. THE ONLY WAY  YOU COULD REACH THIS COURTYARD IS BY DELIBERATELY  AVOIDING THE GUARDS. THIS IS A CRIME  OF THE HIGHEST MAGNITUDE. BUT YOU MADE THE TIGERS OBEY. NO...SHE WAS JUST FRIGHTENED AND CONFUSED. I JUST...JUST CALMED HER. HE BROKE INTO  THE SACRED PRECINCT. HE MUST BE PUNISHED. HE SAVED  MY LIFE, DAGAN. WHILE YOU ARE IN CHALKA,  YOU SHALL BY MY GUEST. SEE TO IT. THE QUEEN MAY BE TAKEN IN... BUT I AM NOT. I'LL REMEMBER THAT. YOU, FIND BARZO. ASK HIM WHAT  HE KNOWS OF A MAN CALLED DAR. [ LAUGHING ] AH! YOUR FRIEND IS A GUEST IN THE SACRED  PRECINCT. GUEST? IS HE IN DANGER? OH, DIFFICULT TO SAY. YOU'VE DRIVEN  THE DEMONS FROM MY MOUTH. WHAT'S HAPPENED TO DAR? OH....WELL... THEY SAY THE QUEEN  FAVOURS HIM... BUT DAGAN DOESN'T. DAGAN USUALLY GETS HIS WAY. CAN YOU HELP  ME FIND HIM? MMM...IT COULD BE ARRANGED. I'VE GOT CONTACTS AMONG THE GUARDS. OF COURSE, THERE WOULD BE  A LITTLE CONSIDERATION. PSST, NOMAR. WHO ARE YOU? SOMEONE WHO'S GETTING YOU OUT. COME ON, MOVE IT. COME ON,  ON YOUR FEET. YOU'RE TO JOIN YOUR TEAM. WHAT TEAM? FOR TOMORROW'S GAME. [ CHUCKLING ] [ HUMMING ] PARDON ME, MY QUEEN, BUT THIS  STRANGER, THAT YOU INSIST ON TREATING WITH GRATITUDE,  IS NO SIMPLE TRAVELLER. DAGAN, HE IS KNOWN AS THE BEASTMASTER. INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO  COMMUNICATE WITH ANIMALS. HE ALSO TRAVELS WITH A MAN  CALLED TAO, WHO'S WELL-STEEPED IN ANCIENT LORE.  WHAT OF IT? THEIR PRESENCE HERE  CAN BE NO COINCIDENCE. THEY COME TO FREE  THE TIGERS AND TO OVERTHROW YOUR THRONE. THEN WHY DID HE SAVE ME? DID HE REALLY? OR DID HE  CAUSE YOU TO BE THREATENED IN  THE FIRST PLACE? DOESN'T IT STRIKE YOU AS ODD THAT THE TIGERS  BROKE FROM THE CAGE AT THE PRECISE  MOMENT HE ARRIVED? BRING HIM TO ME. AT ONCE, MAJESTY. I'M ALREADY HERE. -GUARDS!  -NYOKO, LISTEN TO ME. -STAY AWAY FROM ME.  -I MEAN NO HARM. STAY BACK. OI, FACE-ACHE. THE SACRED PRECINCT'S IN UPROAR. YOUR FRIEND  ATTACKED QUEEN NYOKA. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THEY'VE ALREADY  GOT HIM IN THE CELLS. I HAVE TO FIND HIM. NO, YOU CAN'T. [ BELCHING ] NOT WITHOUT ME. BACK OFF! WHY HAVE YOU COME TO CHALKA? TELL ME THE TRUTH. TO SAVE A MAN FROM  YOUR KIND OF JUSTICE. -WHICH MAN?  -HE'S CALLED NOMAR. NOMAR? NOMAR BETRAYED MY TRUST HE SAVED A FRIEND OF MINE  FROM YOUR CAGES. A FRIEND? A TIGER. THEN IT'S AS DAGAN SAYS. YOU ARE THE BEASTMASTER. DO YOU HAVE POWER  OVER THE ANIMLS? I HAVE POWER OVER NO ONE. IS DAGAN RIGHT? DID YOU FREE THE TIGRESS  TO DEMONSTRATE YOUR MAGIC -AND WIN MY CONFIDENCE?  -I DON'T HAVE MAGIC EITHER. WOULD YOU HAVE MY THRONE? NO. BUT DAGAN WOULD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? HE'S THE ONE WHO RELEASED  THE TIGER FROM THE CAGE. -HOW DO YOU KNOW THIS?  -SHE TOLD ME. SHE'S ALSO SEEN HIM  PLOTTING AGAINST YOU, BECAUSE HE THINKS YOU'VE CHANGED  THE WAY CHALKA'S RULED. AND THAT MEANS  TAKING AWAY THE GAME. AND YOU BELIEVED HER?  AN ANIMAL? ANIMALS DON'T LIE. IS WHAT NOMAR SAID ALSO TRUE? THAT THE TIGERS  ARE UNHAPPY IN MY COURTYARD? THEY SHOULDN'T BE IN CAGES. BUT THE RULERS OF CHALKA HAVE  HAD TIGERS FOR GENERATIONS. THEY SHOW THE WORLD  THAT WE ARE STRONG... AND NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH. THEY SHOW THE WORLD  THAT YOU HAVE NO HEART. WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU  HAVE ME BELIEVE? THAT I'M NO THREAT TO YOU. BUT YOU ARE. YOU ARE. GUARD. HE WON'T SEE US. YOU'RE SURE? WOULD I BE HERE  IF I WASN'T SURE? [ HACKING AND COUGHING ] I DIDN'T SAVE YOUR LIFE  JUST TO SPEND IT THE NEXT DAY. I DO FOR HIM, HE DOES FOR ME. WHAT A WORLD. IT'S TRUE... I DO WANT TO END THE GAME. AND I STRUGGLE  WITH MANY OF OUR WAYS. -I UNDERSTAND. -BUT THE TIGERS ARE PRIVILEGED. LAVISHED WITH ATTENTION. THEY HAVE EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING BUT THEIR FREEDOM. YOU'RE JUST LIKE NOMAR. WHY AM I EVEN  DISCUSSING THIS WITH YOU? BECAUSE YOU ASK YOURSELF  THE SAME QUESTIONS. DON'T CRY OUT.  I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. ALL RIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? I'N GOING TO  SHOW YOU THE TRUTH. CALL THE GUARDS. THE CELLS ARE UP AHEAD. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN  WHEN WE FIND HIM? I'M NOT SURE. HERE, TAKE THIS. I DON'T NEED  A WEAPON. TAKE IT --  YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE OF CHALKA WOULD AS SOON KILL  AS ASK QUESTIONS. AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE GUARDS. TAKE IT. I JUST HOPE THEY  DON'T FIGURE OUT THAT I WON'T  REALLY USE IT. PERHAPS SIMPLY HAVING IT  WILL SERVE THE PURPOSE. THEY CAN'T FEEL WHAT WE FEEL. THEY'RE NOT LIKE US. BUT THEY HAVE THE SAME LONGING  TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST. AND YOU DENY THEM THAT. CAN'T YOU SEE WHAT THEY FEEL  WHEN YOU LOOK INTO THEIR EYES? OF COURSE I CAN. SHE KNOWS THAT I LOVE HER  AND I GIVE HER THE BEST I CAN. WHEN ALL SHE WANTS  FROM YOU IS HER FREEDOM. BUT WHAT MY DUTY  TO MY PEOPLE? I MEAN, YOU'RE  ASKING ME TO DENY EVERYTHING THAT  HAS MEANING TO ME. NO, I'M ASKING YOU TO SEE THAT THE WAY OF CHALKA  IS THE WAY OF DEATH. IT HAS TO END...  AND YOU CAN DO IT. I DON'T HAVE  THAT POWER. YOU'RE THEIR QUEEN. IT'S NOT THAT  SIMPLE. MY PEOPLE-- YOUR PEOPLE WILL UNDERSTAND. -STOP IT!  -YOU CAN SHOW THE WAY. I'M SORRY. [ SOBBING ] WAIT HERE. BARZO. SEIZE THE... ASSASSIN. [ CHUCKLING ] [ GROWLING ] WHAT IS IT? SOMEONE'S COMING. YOU MUSTN'T BE FOUND HERE. STAY BACK. THIS MAN MEANS ME NO HARM. STEP AWAY  FROM THE QUEEN. FORGIVE ME,  MY QUEEN. YOU HAVE BEEN  BADLY USED. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  -BRING HIM IN. THIS MAN IS A FRIEND  OF THE BEASTMASTER. HE WAS FOUND IN THE CORRIDORS OF THE SACRED PRECINCT...  WITH THIS. ON HIS WAY HERE TO JOIN  IN A CONSPIRACY -TO MURDER YOU.  -THAT'S NOT TRUE. IT'S NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS, DAGAN. IF DAR WISHED ME DEAD, I WOULD BE DEAD BY NOW. UNFORTUNATELY, MY QUEEN...  THERE IS A WITNESS. ONE WHO OVERHEARD  THEM PLOTTING. THEY TRIED TO ENLIST HIM IN THEIR CONSPIRACY. IT'S TRUE, MY QUEEN. THEY INTENDED TO KILL YOU, AND THEN LOOSE THE SACRED  TIGERS TO CREATE CHAOS. WHO ARE YOU? I AM ONE WHOSE WORD  CAN NOT BE DOUBTED. BECAUSE...MY OWN LIFE DEPENDS ON YOUR...FRIENDSHIP. ZAD? SLAY ME IF YOU WISH, FOR REMAINING  WITHIN YOUR WALLS, BUT I HAD TO GAIN YOUR TRUST. HOW DID YOU KNOW? I'VE CROSSED PATHS WITH THIS BEASTMASTER BEFORE. SURELY, SAVING YOUR LIFE  PROVES MY AFFECTION. KING ZAD, I OFFER YOU THE  PROFOUND GRATITUDE OF MYSELF, MY QUEEN AND OF ALL OUR PEOPLE. I DID NO MORE THAN MY DUTY TO A FELLOW MONARCH  AND CHERISHED ALLY. STILL TROUBLED,  MY QUEEN? IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE. HE SEEMED SO TRUSTWORTHY. I'VE ENCOUNTERED  THE BEASTMASTER MANY TIMES, YOUR HIGHNESS. HE SHARES THE CUNNING  OF THE BEASTS HE COMMANDS. YET REFUSES TO COMMAND THEM. NYOKA? [ SIGHING ] MY APOLOGIES, DAGAN. YOU WERE RIGHT. I WAS, I WAS FOOLISH. NO APOLOGY  IS NECESSARY. I LIVE ONLY  TO SERVE YOU. WELL, PERHAPS WE SHOULD DISCUSS HOW MANY OF OUR SOLDIERS YOU WILL NEED... AND HOW CHALKA  WILL BE REWARDED FOR ITS HELP. I'LL LEAVE THOSE  DETAILS TO YOU, DAGAN. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, KING ZAD. OF COURSE. [ GROWLING ] YOUR PLAN WAS SUPERB. YOU SHALL HAVE  THE PICK OF OUR YOUNG MEN  FOR YOUR ARMY. WHEN VODEN IS GONE,  I'LL RETURN THE FAVOUR BY GETTING RID OF THAT  ROYAL PAIN IN THE ASS. [ LAUGHING ] BARZO SERVED US BETTER THAN YOU LED US TO EXPECT. EVEN THE BEASTMASTER  WAS FOOLED. HE GOES TO THE  ARENA TOMORROW. WHERE HE WILL, NO DOUBT,  LEAD THE VICTORIOUS TEAM. THE QUEEN'S CURRENT CHAMPIONS  ARE FORMIDABLE FOES. THEY'VE YET TO MEET  THE BEATMASTER. IF HE WINS,  NYOKA WILL THINK HE'S -FAVOURED BY THE GODS.  -HA, HA, OH, YES. [ AS BARZO ]: I'VE GIVEN  THAT SOME THOUGHT. GO ON! YOU'RE THE MAN ON THE ROOF. YEAH. YOU WERE GOING TO GET ME OUT. THERE'S BEEN  A CHANGE OF PLAN. I DIDN'T TRUST MYSELF. THE MOMENT  I LOOKED AT HIS FACE-- ONCE YOU'RE HERE,  YOUR FATE IS DECREED. WHAT'S DECREED FOR US? -THE GAME.  -TOMORROW. THE GAME... WHAT EXACTLY ARE  THE RULES OF THIS GAME? WELL, THE OBJECT OF THE GAME  IS TO STUFF THE SHINY ROCKS THAT THEY TOSS US INTO  THE EYE SOCKETS OF THE ICON. TWO SCORES WINS. WHAT IF EACH SIDE SCORES? THE LAST ROCK MUST BE PLACED IN THE OPENING  OF THE TIGER'S THROAT. THE OTHER SIDE WILL DO  ANYTHING TO STOP US. IF THEY DON'T, THEN THEY'LL  BE THE ONES WHO'LL DIE. [ CHEERING ] WE SHOULD FORM A PLAN -- ATTACK, COUNTER-ATTACK -- LIKE WARFARE. TOA, THEY'RE  GOING TO KILL US WITH  THEIR BARE HANDS. FOUR MEN  IN THIS ARENA WILL SOON BE DEAD. JUST WHO? THE GODS  WILL DECIDE. NO.  WE'LL DECIDE. THESE TWO MADE AN ATTEMPT  ON OUR QUEEN'S LIFE. WE SHOULD SEE THEM AT  EACH OTHER'S THROATS. PLACE THAT MAN ON THE OTHER SIDE. IT GIVES THE CROWD  GREATER PLEASURE TO SEE THE CRIMINALS  FIGHT AMONGST THEMSELVES. THE BEASTMASTER WON'T  ALLOW HIS FRIEND TO DIE. YOU CAN COUNT ON IT. LET THE GAME BEGIN! THEY'LL KILL YOU  IF YOU DON'T PLAY TO WIN. WHAT DO WE DO? PLAY TO WIN. BEGIN! GO, I'LL COVER YOU. HE'S CONDEMNING HIS OWN  TEAM-MATES TO SAVE US. I KNOW. ONE TO ONE. NEXT SCORE WINS. HE'S ONLY MAKING IT  MORE INTERESTING. LIFE AND DEATH. I DO LOVE THIS GAME. NUMBER THREE! TIME TO GO FOR THE THROAT. HE CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO WIN. KILL THAT MAN! KILL HIM! -KILL THEM ALL!  -NO! -SPARE NO ONE!  -DAGAN, STOP IT! DAGAN...ARE YOU MAD? MY, MY QUEEN... GUARDS! STAY BACK! STAY BACK! [ GROWLING ] DAR! AHH! [ ROARING ] [ SCREAMING ] I'M SORRY. THIS TIME THE GODS  HAVE TRULY SPOKEN. MY TIGERS WILL GO FREE. CHALKA HAS SEEN  ENOUGH BLOODSHED. I KNOW THIS IS  THE RIGHT THING, BUT-- IT'S HARD  TO SAY GOODBYE. YES. WHAT'S THE TIGER SAYING? SHE WANTS YOU TO KNOW  THAT SHE FORGIVES YOU. ENJOY YOUR FREEDOM. WILL SHE BE HAPPY? SHE'S FREE... THE REST WILL BE UP TO HER. YOU'VE FREED ME TO, YOU'VE FREED ALL OF US FROM THE  CAGE THAT WE BUILT OURSELVES. WILL YOU BE ALL RIGHT? IT'LL TAKE SOME  GETTING USED TO. BUT, GIVEN TIME, I GUESS, PERHAPS, LIKE THEM,  WE MAY FIND OUR WAY. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
