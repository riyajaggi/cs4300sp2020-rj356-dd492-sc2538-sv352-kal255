  LIFE IS ABOUT QUESTIONS, DAR. AND CHILDREN ASK QUESTIONS  ALL THE TIME. WHY DO WE SLEEP?  WHY IS THE SUN HOT? BUT WHEN THEY GROW UP,  THEY STOP ASKING WHY. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY  KNOW THE ANSWERS. THEY DON'T KNOW  ALL THE ANSWERS. AND WE SHOULD  BE ASKING QUESTIONS BUT THEN THERE WOULDN'T BE  ANY TIME TO HEAR THE ANSWERS. WHAT? YOU'VE BEEN TALKING  ABOUT THIS ALL MORNING. BUT YOU HAVEN'T HEARD  THE BIRDS SINGING.

 AND YOU DIDN'T LISTEN  TO THE WATER TRICKLE THROUGH THE BROOK  WE JUST CROSSED. MUST YOU ALWAYS  BE THIS CURIOUS? CURIOSITY LEADS TO DISCOVERY,  DISCOVERY LEADS TO KNOWLEDGE, AND KNOWLEDGE HAS TO BE  OUR GREATEST GOAL. AH, BUT IT'S ALSO WISE TO KNOW  WHEN TO LEAVE THINGS ALONE. BECAUSE TOO MUCH CURIOSITY CAN  UPSET THE BALANCE OF NATURE. WHY? [ SIGHING ] I THINK WHAT  I'M TRYING TO SAY IS, DON'T LET WHAT'S  GOING ON IN HERE, OVERSHADOW WHAT'S  GOING ON IN HERE. ACTUALLY, RIGHT NOW, MY STOMACH IS TELLING ME THAT I'M HUNGRY. OK.

 YOU GO AND LOOK  FOR THE FOOD, AND I'LL MAKE  THE FIRE. TAKE THESE LITTLE GUYS  TO HELP YOU. THANK YOU. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT  I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU SEE, WE KNOW  FROM THE COLOUR THAT THESE BERRIES  ARE NOT FIT TO EAT. THOSE, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE. AND HOW DO WE  KNOW THIS? WELL... AS I SAID, THERE'S  A STORE OF KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS PASSED ON  THROUGH OUR BLOODLINE. SO, WHAT WE FIND IS.. DAR! DAR! DAR! LOOK. IT BEGAN TO GLOW AS SOON AS I PULLED IT OUT OF THE ROCK. LOOK AT THIS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT? I SEE SOMEONE ENCASED BY STONE. GOT CAUGHT IN A MUDSLIDE  WHICH HARDENED OVER TIME. NO...LET HIM  REST IN PEACE. IF WE DIG HIM OUT,  WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND OUT  WHAT TRIBE HE CAME FROM AND WHAT BROUGHT HIM  HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. WHY HAVE YOU  BROUGHT ME HERE? TO WITNESS AN ASPECT OF HUMAN  NATURE WHICH MAKES THEM BOTH UNIQUELY CHARMING  AND UTTERLY MADDENING. IT'S CALLED CURIOSITY. BUT ONE CAN'T LEARN WITHOUT  BEING CURIOUS. YES, BUT HUMANS TAKE IT  ONE STEP TOO FAR. ALL OF THEM? MOSTLY THE ONES  WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER. [ GASPING ] IS SOMETHING  WRONG? VERY WRONG. IN FACT, BEYOND WRONG. WELL, THEN STOP IT. NO -- EVENTS ONCE IN MOTION MUST BE ALLOWED  TO REMAIN IN MOTION. ALWAYS? SO FAR, YES. YOU SEE, DAR, THIS IS IMPORTANT. [ COUGHING ] [ COUGHING ] I BELIEVE THIS BELONGS TO ME. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... I DON'T... UNDERSTAND? OF COURSE NOT --  YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND. YOU'VE SET ME FREE. AND NOW THAT I'M FREE, THE WORLD AS YOU KNOW IT IS ABOUT TO CHANGE. IN WHAT WAY? ANY WAY I CHOOSE. PERHAPS, I SHOULD START WITH YOU. LEAVE HIM ALONE. DON'T CHALLENGE ME, MORTAL. THERE WAS A TIME  WHEN EARTH AND EVERYTHING -ON IT TREMBLED BEFORE ME.  -NOT ANY MORE. SORCERY. LIKE NONE YOU'VE EVER SEEN. BACK IN THAT TIME, ONLY MY TRUSTED CEREBUS... THE DOG WHO GUARDED  THE ENTRANCE TO MY WORLD... HAD THE RIGHT TO APPROACH ME. ALL OTHERS WOULD  AVERT THEIR EYES AND CRINGE IN TERROR! OOF! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? BECAUSE I CAN. WHO ARE YOU? ANNUBIS! COME TO RECLAIM MY RIGHTFUL WORLD. THANKS TO YOU, MY CURIOUS FRIEND. YOU DESERVE A FITTING REWARD FOR RETURNING ME TO THIS... LAND OF THE LIVING. YES... A CREATURE OF REASON. ONE WHO QUESTIONS HIS WORLD, INSTEAD OF BEING AWED BY IT. YOU NEED TO LEARN  OBEDIENCE AND RESPECT, LIKE MY CEREBUS -- YOU NEED TO EXPERIENCE  THE EXQUISITE WONDER OF FEAR. BY DAY'S END, YOU WILL SEE THE WORLD THROUGH  DIFFERENT EYES, MY FRIEND. AND WHAT YOU WILL SEE WILL BE A DIFFERENT WORLD. I CAN ALREADY TASTE YOUR FEAR! OH, FOR THE NEXT COURSE. PANIC, SUFFERING, CONFUSION! IT SHALL BE A FEAST! TAO... LET'S GET  OUT OF HERE. WHY IS HE-- WHY IS HE  MAKING THIS HAPPEN? I DON'T KNOW. LET'S GET THE ANIMALS TO SAFETY, THEN WE'LL GO AFTER HIM  AND FIND OUT. LET'S GO BACK AND MAKE SURE  THERE ARE NO MORE ANIMALS. DAR, DAR, WE KNOW... LOOK, THE FIRE'S SPREADING. WE SHOULD GO. WHAT'S WRONG? YOU CAN SMELL THAT, CAN'T YOU? [ SNIFFING ] ALL I SMELL  IS SMOKE. IT'S OVER HERE. TAO! [ WHINING ] I KNEW IT. YOU COULD SMELL HIM  IN ALL THIS SMOKE? I KNOW, IT DOESN'T MAKE  ANY SENSE TO ME EITHER. DAR, HE'S CHANGED ME.  HE'S CHANGED ME SOMEHOW. IT'S SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE. I CAN FEEL IT. WHAT? NOTHING. LET'S GET BACK TO THE RIVER. I HAVE QUESTIONS. THEN ASK. THAT LOOK IN YOUR EYES... I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU  SO TROUBLED. I THOUGHT SUCH DESTRUCTION OUGHT NOT TO MOVE OUR EMOTIONS. CORRECT -- HOWEVER, ONE CAN'T  HELP HAVING CERTAIN REACTIONS. YES...PARENTS WISH THE BEST  FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THEY FEED THEM, CLOTHE THEM,  HELP THEM LEARN. THEN ONE DAY, THEY MUST LET GO, AND BECOME OBSERVERS  IN THEIR LIVES. AND LATER, SOMETHING  HAPPENS TO THE CHILDREN THAT THE PARENTS CAN'T CONTROL? YOU LEARN QUICKLY. THE PARENTS  MUST LET THE CHILDREN DEAL WITH THE EVENTS  ON THEIR OWN... YET IT STILL MAKES  THE PARENTS FEEL-- SOMETHING IS HAPPENING  TO A LAND AND CREATURES I FEEL ODDLY ATTACHED TO. SADLY, I CANNOT PREVENT IT. CANNOT OR WILL NOT? AMOUNTS TO THE SAME THING. ISN'T ANNUBIS  A THREAT TO THE ORDER OF  THE NATURAL WORLD? ANNUBIS HAS  NO CONCEPT OF ORDER. THE ONLY THING  HE UNDERSTANDS IS EXCESS. HE WAS NEVER MEANT  TO BE FREE IN THIS WORLD. NOW HE'S RENDING  THE VERY FABRIC OF FATE. I THINK I KNOW WHAT ANNUBIS  MEANT BY SAYING YOU'D SEE THE WORLD THROUGH  DIFFERENT EYES. TAO, YOU'RE BECOMING  SOMETHING ELSE. I'M TURNING INTO AN ANIMAL? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO? WE MAY STILL HAVE TIME, I MEAN, HE DID SAY IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN  UNTIL NIGHTFALL, RIGHT? WELL, THAT'S ALL  RIGHT, THEN. OH... THIS, THIS HAS TO STOP. IT LOOKS  LIKE ALL HIS POWER CAME  FROM THE SCEPTRE. I MEAN, THE FIRE, THE BLOWS HE THREW AGAINST ME. THE FLASH THAT  BLINDED YOU -- WHAT IF WE GET THE SCEPTRE  FROM HIM? MAYBE THEN-- MAYBE THEN, WHAT? WE DON'T KNOW HOW  IT WORKS, OR... WE HAVE ABSOLUTLEY NO IDEA  HOW MUCH POWER HE HAS. WOOF! STOP IT. IARA. WHAT ARE YOU  DOING HERE? IT'S A LITTLE BIT  HARD TO CONCENTRATE ON IN THE FOREST TRAMPLING  THROUGH MY WATERS IN TERROR. SINCE YOUR DOMAIN  EXTENDS BEYOND THE WATER, WHY DON'T YOU TRY DOING  SOMETHING TO HELP THEM? HMM... WHAT DID THIS? SOMEONE WHO CALLS  HIMSELF ANNUBIS. ANNUBIS? YOU KNOW HIM? WHO IS HE? THE DESTROYER. DESTROYER? HE WAS GRANTED POWER OVER  THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF NATURE. FIRE...WATER...AIR AND EARTH. BUT HE MISUSED THAT POWER,  AND WAS IMPRISONED IN A ROCK. I SET HIM FREE. HE IS IMMORTAL  AND ALL-POWERFUL. NOTHING CAN STAND IN HIS WAY. WE MUST TRY. CAN YOU CALL THE WATERS DOWN, PUT THE FIRES OUT? -PFF...CALL DOWN THE WATERS.  -IARA, PLEASE. DO IT FOR THE ANIMALS. WILL YOU DO IT FOR ME?  I'M ASKING YOU. HERE. ANNUBIS! A SPRINKLE OF RAIN.  SO...UNDERWHELMING. ALLOW ME TO DEMONSTRATE  HOW IT'S DONE. YOUR POWERS ARE LAUGHABLE, LITTLE ONE. YOU'RE A PATHETIC  LITTLE DEMON, RAPT IN THE PETTY SQUABBLES THAT PATHETIC LITTLE DEMONS NEED TO PASS THEIR DAYS! YOU HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING  OF THE WATERS YOU CLAIM TO COMMAND! NO UNDERSTANDING AT ALL! YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO BE HERE! IS THIS A PRIVATE FUNCTION? AND YOU HAVE NO POWERS  TO STOP ME! WHAT HAVE I DONE? -NOTHING STANDS IN HIS WAY.  -THERE MUST BE SOMETHING. DAR, IF THIS RAIN DOESN'T STOP SOON,  ALL THE ANIMALS WE FREED FROM THE FIRE  WILL SOON BE SWEPT AWAY. OUR ONLY HOPE'S  TO GET ANNUBIS. DAR, WE CAN'T FIND HIM,  AND EVER IF WE DO, WE CAN'T DEFEAT  AN IMMORTAL...OHH. WE'LL HAVE TO TRY. THIS IS ALL MY FAULT. IF I HADN'T HAVE DUG THAT  SCEPTRE FROM THE ROCK...ARG! WHATEVER HE'S DONE TO ME  IS GETTING WORSE. IT FEELS LIKE ALL  OF MY INSIDES ARE CHANGING, AND IT'S...ACH... HARD TO TALK WE'LL FIND HIM SOON,  AND WHEN WE DO, TAO, WE'LL FIND YOU A CURE. HOW? WE'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED ANYONE WITH THIS KIND OF POWER  BEFORE, AND RIGHT NOW, IT FEELS LIKE HE HAS DOMINION  OVER THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE. HIS POWERS COME FROM THE  SCEPTRE. I'M SURE OF IT NOW. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS JUST  GET IT AWAY FROM HIM. WHAT IS IT? DO YOU  SMELL SOMETHING? ANNUBIS. WELL, WELL, WELL. LONG TIME, NO SEE. WE WISH TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS  ON AN IMMINENT MATTER. IMMINENT? IN WHOSE TIME FRAME? SURELY, NOT YOURS OR MINE. WHY DESTROY THE LIVES  OF ALL THESE CREATURES? I WANT THE WORLD TO RETURN  TO ITS NATURAL STATE. -CHAOS?  -EXACTLY. THE FORCES OF NATURE AT THEIR  STRONGEST AND MOST PURE. YES, BUT THAT STATE  DOESN'T LAST, DOES IT? EVENTUALLY CHAOS CAUSES  THE WHOLE PROCESS OF CREATION TO START AGAIN. NOT IF I CAN HELP IT. YOU CAN'T STOP IT. I DON'T HAVE  THE PATIENCE TO WAIT FOR IT TO GET BACK  TO WHERE IT IS NOW. PATIENCE? DON'T TALK  TO ME ABOUT PATIENCE! I'V BEEN WAITING EONS  FOR THIS DAY. I'M ONLY TRYING TO SAVE YOU  A LOT OF WASTED EFFORT. YOU'RE TRYING TO COVER YOUR OWN MISTAKE. YOU HAVEN'T TOLD HER. HAVE YOU GROWN  ADDLED WITH TIME? YOU KNOW HIM? OLD FRIENDS, WE'RE NOT. YES, WE DID MEET ONCE. BUT I MUST SAY...  ONCE WAS ENOUGH. I THOUGHT ANNUBIS  COULD BE TAUGHT TO HARNESS HIS POWERS. TO ASSIST IN CREATION. SO, I RELEASED HIM  FROM HIS PRISON OF ROCK. WE DISAGREED ON THE WAY THE UNIVERSE SHOULD RUN --  HE WAS ACTION, I WAS REACTION. I BELIEVE THAT ONCE  EVENTS ARE SET IN MOTION, THEY MUST BE LEFT  TO FIND THEIR OWN COURSE. ANNUBIS, HOWEVER, PUSHED THE POWERS  OF NATURE TO THEIR FULL WHAT HE PUT IN MOTION, INCREASED IN MOTION UNTIL  IT DESTROYED EVERYTHING IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH. HE KNEW NOTHING IN MODERATION. SO, I DECIDED HE NEEDED SOME TIME  FOR CONTEMPLATION -- SOME TIME TO SEE WHAT NATURE COULD EVOLVE IF IT WERE GIVEN TIME TO EVOLVE. YOU ENCASED ME IN MUD FOR EONS. FORCED ME TO WATCH AN ETERNITY  OF LIFE ENDLESSLY EVOLVING. AND YOU'VE LEARNED  NOTHING IN ALL THAT TIME? YOU'RE SURE ANNUBIS  IS THIS WAY? TAO, TALK TO ME. DAR! THIS IS MADNESS. YOU CANNOT FIGHT  AGAINST AN IMMORTAL. I HAVE TO DO  SOMETHING. NO. HELP YOURSELF. CHOOSE TO LIVE. IARA, I CAN'T LIVE IN A WORLD THAT ISN'T FILLED  WITH THE LIVING. MY WORLD WILL SURVIVE  THIS INUNDATION. I CAN SHELTER YOU BENEATH THE  WATERS. YOU'LL BE SAFE THERE. DO NOT OVERESTIMATE YOUR STRENGTHS. I HAVE TO GO. DAR! WHY ARE YOU  BEING SO STUBBORN? EVERY CREATURE THAT WALKS  THE EARTH IS ABOUT TO DIE. BUT WE CAN LIVE BENEATH  THE WATERS FOREVER. -IARA! NO.  -DAR, PLEASE! IARA, THE WORLD WILL CEASE TO  EXIST IF I DON'T STOP ANNUBIS. I'LL DO THAT ANY WAY I CAN. RECONSIDER YOUR ACTIONS. WHY DON'T YOU  FIND A GOOD SEAT? SIT BACK, RELAX AND OBSERVE. PUT HIM BACK  IN THE ROCK. SEAL IT FOR  GOOD THIS TIME. -I CAN'T DO THAT.  -WHY? PERHAPS, HE IS CURIOUS TO SEE A WORLD IN CHAOS? YOU DO APPRECIATE THE BEAUTY  OF NATURE IN RAMPAGE. OH, OF COURSE, I HAVE FRONT ROW  SEATS TO THE UNIVERSE. HE'S MAKING THIS WORLD  INTO A LIVING HELL. KINDLY, STAY OUT OF MY WAY. A WORLD IN CHAOS WOULD BE  LIKE A BLACK HOLE OF NOTHING, IF THERE WAS NO ONE  TO SEE IT. OH, BUT I DO HAVE SOMEONE. A MAN WHO PROTECTS LIFE,  AND A MAN OF REASON. TWO THINGS I CAN  MOST DO WITHOUT. THERE'S ONLY ONE POWER  THAT CAN CONTAIN HIM. WHO? ACTUALLY --  AND THAT WOULD BE THOSE WHO RELEASED HIM  IN THE FIRST PLACE. TAO, GET UP.  WE HAVE TO KEEP GOING. DAR, WAIT. WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN  IF THE RAIN DOESN'T STOP? THERE'LL  BE NOTHING LEFT IN THE  WORLD BUT FISH. AND WOULD THAT BE  A DESIRABLE OUTCOME? I LIKE FISH. YES, BUT OUR JOB IS  TO OVERSEE THE MEASURED AND A WORLD OF FISH  WOULD TIP THE SCALES? SCALES. [ LAUGHING ] YOU'RE TERRIBLY WITTY. NO, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT A WORLD  OF FISH WOULD DO. STILL, OUR BEASTMASTER  MAY YET FIND A WAY. IT'S THERE IF HE LOOKS FOR IT. THERE IS A WAY. OH, THERE'S FAR  TOO MUCH AT STAKE. WHY, THE SLIGHTEST SLIP  OF THE TONGUE COULD KILL THEM ALL. YOU USE MY GIFT OF  TRANSFORMATION AGAINST ME! AND YOU'RE LEARNING. WITHOUT THAT THING,  YOU'RE NOTHING AT ALL. THE AMENTA IS BUT  A SYMBOL OF MY POWER. I AM THE IMMORTAL! HOW MANY LIVES  WILL IT TAKE BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND  THE PAIN YOU'VE CAUSED? YOU'LL NEVER KNOW, AND I  WOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH TO HAPPEN IN THE SHORT TIME  YOU'VE GOT LEFT IN THIS WORLD. HA, HA, HA... OH...WHAT'S THIS?  A LITTLE MUD-HOLE? OPTING FOR A SUMMER BREEZE,  WHEN YOU SHOULD BE CALLING DOWN A TORNADO? WAIT FOR IT... DAR... [ LAUGHING ] -DAR!  -IARA, HELP HIM! HE'S BEING DRAGGED  TO THE MUD-HOLE. TIME TO SLOW YOU  DOWN, MY FRIEND. MAYBE FOR THE LAST TIME. I AM THE POWER, MORTAL! YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. DAR, HOLD ON! IARA, DO SOMETHING! I CAN'T! HIS POWERS ARE  STRONGER THAN MINE. DAR, DAR... DAR! DAR! DAR! AHH...DAR! NO! DAR! NO! DAR! HERE...HERE, TAKE IT. DON'T KID YOURSELF. YOUR POWERS ARE PATHETIC,  LITTLE ONE. I COULDN'T LET  YOU MISS THIS ONE. IT'S ONE OF MY FAVOURITES. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WHY DO YOU KEEP TORTURING US? STILL ASKING WHY? BUT THIS THING YOU CALL  YOU LIFE HAS VALUE? THE ELEMENTS OF NATURE  ARE NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH BY  CREATURES SUCH AS YOU. YOU'LL SOON LEARN TO BOW BEFORE MY POWERS. AHHH! AND SO WILL YOU. [ LAUGHING ] TAO, I NEED YOU  TO STAY HERE. I, I HAVE TO HELP YOU. IT'LL BE SAFER IF YOU STAY HERE. I'M COMING WITH YOU. DON'T TRY TO TALK. THERE ARE STILL SOME ANIMALS  I HAVE TO TAKE TO SHELTER. I HAVE TO FIND ANNUBIS. I CAN'T DO ALL  THAT AND WATCH OUT FOR YOU AT THE SAME TIME. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? [ GROANING ] DAR, DON'T GIVE UP ON ME. YOU KNOW I WON'T DO THAT. DON'T FORGET WHO I WAS... WAS...UGH... HE'S HARDLY A MAN. HE'S STILL MY FRIEND. HE'S LOST, CAN'T YOU SEE THAT? I NEED YOU TO STAY  AND PROTECT HIM. DAR, I CAN'T HELP HIM,  AND I CAN'T HELP YOU OR THIS WORLD ANY LONGER. BACK TO AN UNDERWATER WORLD  THAT THIS CHAOS DOESN'T TOUCH. MY OFFER IS STILL OPEN, DAR. I CAN TAKE YOU WITH ME. WHY DO YOU RESIST  YOUR OWN SURVIVAL? BECAUSE RUNNING  IS NOT AN OPTION. SUCH LOYALTY TO A LOST CAUSE. CAN'T YOU HEAR WHAT  ANNUBIS IS TELLING YOU? FOLLOW THE PATH  OF LEAST RESISTANCE. OBEY THE WILL OF NATURE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU CAN'T STAY AND HELP THE ANIMALS  YOU CLAIM YOU PROTECT. DAR, I ALREADY  LEARNT MY LESSON. WHY ARE YOU THE ONLY  ONE THAT RESISTS? TAO, NO! YOU CAN'T GO  OUT THERE. IT'S NOT SAFE. THAT'S RIGHT.  I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND. I NEED YOU TO SIT DOWN. YOU'LL BE OK. YOU'LL BE OK. NOW I HAVE TO GO... ALL RIGHT?  BUT I'LL COME BACK. I PROMISE. YOU SEE SOME RAY OF HOPE? IF OUR FRIEND  IS SENSIBLE, THEY MAY SURVIVE. YOU'RE TAKING SIDES. I'M TREADING  THAT FINE LINE BETWEEN PARTIALITY  AND DETACHMENT. YOU SAID OUR ROLE IS TO MAKE  SURE CREATION CONTINUED, AND TO NOT CARE WHICH  INDIVIDUALS SURVIVED. YES, BUT SOMETIMES  ONE NEEDS TO USE A LITTLE  INITIATIVE. IARA... AND WE THOUGHT YOU'D GONE HOME. OH, BY THE WAY, LOVE THE SPEECH. SAVE HIM. I NEED YOUR HELP. SAVE DAR? FROM ANNUBIS? DON'T PLAY WITH ME. YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME  LOOKING FOR HELP HERE. IT'S APPARENTLY A SERVICE  WE DON'T PROVIDE. YOU CLAIM TO BE ALL-KNOWING. SO YOU MUST KNOW SOME  WAY TO STOP ANNUBIS DO YOU FEAR FOR THE BEASTMASTER  OR FOR HIS WORLD? OR HAVE YOU SUDDENLY REALIZED HOW HEAVY CURUPIRA'S MANTLE  IS TO WEAR? I'M OVERCOME BY THIS BURDEN  TO HELP ALL LIVING THINGS. I DIDN'T WANT THIS. THEN PERHAPS YOU SHOULDN'T  HAVE TAKEN IT. I WANT TO HELP DAR... BUT I CANNOT. I WANT TO SUBMERGE  INTO MY OWN WORLD... BUT I CANNOT DO THAT EITHER. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START. START NOWHERE, DO NOTHING. INVOLVEMENT JUST  BRINGS CONFUSION. GOOD LUCK. [ SIGHING ] IT'S TOO BAD  HE CAN'T BE KILLED. YOU MUST  FORGIVE HIM. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? YOU WANT TO SAVE  THE MAN YOU LOVE. ANYONE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. I'VE NE-- I'VE NEVER FELT  LIKE THIS BEFORE. IT'S AS IF I HAVE NO CHOICE. ANNUBIS CAN ONLY BE STOPPED  BY THOSE WHO FREED HIM. DAR AND TAO. BUT TAO CAN BARELY FUNCTION... AND IF YOU TAKE DAR  TO SAFETY, THIS WORLD WILL SURELY DIE. SHARAK, YOU ALL RIGHT? THANK YOU FOR FINDING ANNUBIS. I KNOW HOW YOU CAN DEFEAT HIM. HE MUST GO BACK INTO  THE ROCK WHERE YOU FOUND HIM. YOU AND TAO ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN DO IT, BUT I'LL  STILL BE HERE IF YOU FAIL. ONLY NOTHING ELSE WILL BE HERE. YOU TOLD HER A PART  OF WHAT HE NEEDS TO KNOW. -TECHNICALLY NOT INTERFERING.  -NOT INTERFERING? MERELY BY EXISTING,  WE'RE INTERFERING. A WORD FROM ME  GIVES A THOUGHT TO IARA, GIVES AN ACTION  TO THE BEASTMASTER. SAYING NOTHING JUST GIVES  HER ANOTHER THOUGHT AND HIM ANOTHER ACTION. AND YOU WORKED  THAT ALL OUT WELL, A GREAT TEACHER INSPIRES  LESSONS HE NEVER TAUGHT. YOU ALSO DON'T SEEM  THAT UPSET WITH ME. BUT THE END OF LIFE IS NEAR,  AND YOUR TECHNICALITY MAY HAVE NOT ENOUGH TIME  TO CAUSE A PROBLEM. WHY IS GIVING HOPE A PROBLEM? THIS RULE YOU BLINDLY OBSERVE CONDEMNS US TO A LIFE  OF ETERNAL FRUSTRATION. YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY  NOT LISTENING, MY DEAR. FRUSTRATION IS ONLY FELT WHEN ONE REALIZES THERE'S AN OPTION. PLANTING THE SEED THAT BRINGS  ORDER TO CHAOS IS NO SIN... WHETHER IT SPROUTS IS  STILL THE WILL OF NATURE. [ LAUGHING ] WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG? I'VE BEEN BUSY! SAVING LIVES, SO THEY MAY  BE TERRORIZED A LITTLE LONGER? HOW CONSIDERATE OF YOU. WHAT'S THE PURPOSE  OF YOUR TERROR? IT'S A CHANCE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW PATHETIC YOUR LITTLE  LIVES REALLY ARE. WHAT'S THE POINT OF MAKING  EVERYTHING BEND BEFORE IT? IT'S A JOY YOU CAN  NEVER COMPREHEND. TAKE YOUR CURSE OFF MY FRIEND. WHY? SO THAT HE MAY  CONTINUE TO PRETEND THAT HIS PATHETIC LITTLE  LIFE MEANS SOMETHING? A MOMENT OF CALM, SO THAT  YOU CAN STILL BELIEVE THERE IS A FUTURE, A PURPOSE TO  YOUR EXISTENCE. LIFE IS HERE FOR A PURPOSE. YES, IT GIVES ME SOMETHING TO SNUFF OUT. THE FOURTH AND  FINAL ELEMENT -- EARTH. KISS IT GOODBYE. [ GROANING ] TAO, COME ON, WE'VE GOT  TO GET YOU OUT HERE. [ BARKING ] YOU MUST FIND  ANOTHER WAY TO HELP HIM. SO, WE MEET AT LAST. WHO ARE YOU? I'M STILL WORKING ON THAT. [ SHRIEKING ] YOUR FRIEND BELONGS  TO ANNUBIS NOW. HE'S NO LONGER  ONE OF YOUR KIND, BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS NOT  THE TIME FOR SMALL TALK. LISTEN, I'M TRYING TO FIND-- TRYING WILL NOT SUFFICE TODAY. YOU MUST NOT LOSE THIS BATTLE. YES, I'M TRYING  TO GET HIS WEAPON-- THAT IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE. YOU MUST REMOVE HIS POWER AND MAKE SURE  HE NEVER REGAINS IT. HUMOUR ME FOR A MOMENT. WHO IS ANNUBIS? HE'S SOMEONE WHO  CONTROLS THE ELEMENTS. WHICH ARE? EARTH, AIR, FIRE, AND WATER. EARTH BEING OF  PARTICULAR CONCERN AT THE MOMENT. YOU SAY THERE ARE FOUR ELEMENTS. YES. ARE YOU SURE? THERE'S A FIFTH? PERHAPS ONE THAT ANNUBIS  DOES NOT COMMAND BUT YOU DO. I'M AFRAID HE'S IN NO POSITION  TO HELP YOU NOW. WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME? TELLING YOU WILL NOT  BRING IT FORTH. IT IS WITHIN YOU AND TAO  AND ALL THAT YOU HOLD DEAR. [ HOWLING ] TAO. TAO... LOOK AT ME! I NEED TO KNOW IF  THERE'S A FIFTH ELEMENT. SOMETHING WE COULD USE TO FIGHT ANNUBIS. TAO, I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME. [ SHRIEKING ] DAR! WHAT? [ LAUGHING ] NO MORE! TAO, I NEED THE SCEPTRE. HE CAN'T HELP YOU. AHA! MY CERBERUS IS READY.  HE'S MY CREATURE NOW. AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEARN THE COST OF RESISTANCE. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? TO TAKE REASON  AWAY FROM YOU. AND TO FIND A GUARDIAN  FOR THE NEW HELL THAT WILL SOON ARISE  IN THIS PLACE. IT'S HIS REWARD  FOR SAVING ME -- TO LIVE HERE FOR ALL TIME. NO! [ BARKING ] YOUR END WILL BE PERFECT,  BEASTMASTER... TO DIE IN THE JAWS OF YOUR ONCE LOYAL FRIEND. A FITTING EPITATH  TO YOUR SPECIES. [ GROWLING ] [ BARKING ] TAO. ARGH! TAO, I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE. YOU HAVE TO TRY AND REACH ME. DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.  USE YOUR ANIMAL SENSES. THEY'LL SAY I'M  NOT THE ENEMY. TAO? TRY TO REACH ME. I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU. RIP OUT HIS THROAT! ATTACK! WHY WON'T YOU ATTACK? BECAUSE HE KNOWS  WHAT THE FIFTH ELEMENT IS. CERBERUS, ATTACK! THE FIFTH ELEMENT IS LIFE. IT'S MADE OF THE OTHER FOUR. BUT THE WHOLE IS GREATER  THAN THE PARTS. WE'RE THE POWER  THAT CAN DEFEAT YOU. YOUR POWERS  ARE NO MATCH FOR MINE! THE POWER  OF LIFE IS. HE WON'T, 'CAUSE HE KNOWS THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU'VE MADE HIM, HE'LL STILL BE CLOSER TO  ME THAN HE'LL BE TO YOU. WE'RE PART OF THE SAME CHAIN. SOME OF US LIVE IN THE AIR,  SOME IN WATER, SOME WITHIN THE WARMTH OF FIRE; WHILE OTHERS WON'T  LEAVE THE EARTH. BUT NONE OF US ARE HERE  WITHOUT EACH OTHER. AND TOGETHER WE WILL  ALWAYS OVERCOME. I CONTROL THE ELEMENTS. YOU MUST COWER BEFORE ME! LIFE NEVER COWERS. THAT'S HOW IT PREVAILS. [ LAUGHING ] AND WITHOUT THIS,  YOU'LL HAVE NO POWER AT ALL. I THINK I SHOULD TAKE CARE OF THIS, IN CASE SOME NOSY ARCHEOLOGIST DECIDES TO DIG IT UP AGAIN. YOU'RE NO MATCH  FOR THE FIFTH ELEMENT. BYE-BYE. LIFE ALWAYS FINDS A WAY. PERHAPS THAT IS THE ULTIMATE  INTERFERENCE. PERHAPS I HAVE TAUGHT YOU WELL, FINALLY CREATING  A REPLICA OF MYSELF. LITTLE CHANCE OF THAT. OH, COME, COME. PASSIONATE AND OBSTINATE. WHY, I ALWAYS THOUGHT  I'D BROKEN THE MOULD. IN FACT, I DID. I REMEMBER, SORRY ABOUT THAT. HERE YOU GO. THANK YOU. SO, DO YOU REMEMBER  WHAT IT WAS LIKE? OH, IT WAS FASCINATING. I HAD ALL OF MY OWN THOUGHTS, BUT OVERWHELMED  BY THESE ANIMAL URGES. NOTHING IN THE WORLD  WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME. WHAT URGE WERE YOU FEELING  WHEN YOU WERE THREATENING TO RIP OUT MY THROAT? I WAS JUST BEING LOYAL  TO MY MASTER. AND AFTER YOU'VE  COMMUNICATED WITH ME, I WAS BEING LOYAL TO MY FRIEND. OH, I THINK I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU COMMUNICATE WITH  THE ANIMALS, DO YOU DO IT SINGULARLY OR ALL AT ONCE? IS IT SOME OF THE TIME-- -TAO...  -WHAT? GOOD TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AGAIN. I'M KIND OF HAPPY  ABOUT THAT MYSELF. WHAT IF YOU NEEDED  TO COMMUNICATE WITH ANIMALS-- DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT  HAPPENED THE LAST TIME YOU WERE THIS CURIOUS? BUT WHAT IF YOU HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL LITTLE  CREATURE LIKE THIS ONE? I JUST WANT TO SAY... CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
