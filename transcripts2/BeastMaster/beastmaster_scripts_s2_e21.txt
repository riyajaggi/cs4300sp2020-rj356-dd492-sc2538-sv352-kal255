  IT'S DIFFERENT FOR YOU. CURUPIRA COMES ALONG  AND GIVES YOU A MISSION, AND THAT'S IT. I HAVE NO DIRECTION IN MY LIFE. YOU HAVE PLANS.  YOU'VE TOLD ME ABOUT THEM. THEY'RE DREAMS MORE THAN PLANS. I JUST WANT TO DO SOMETHING. USE MY KNOWLEDGE  TO HELP MY PEOPLE. ISN'T THAT WHAT  YOU'VE BEEN DOING? IT'S JUST EVERY TIME  I FEEL I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING, FATE JUST COMES ALONG  AND PUSHES ME

 I'M NOT. BEASTMASTER. WE MEET AGAIN. YOU'RE A LONG WAY  FROM THE BURNING FOREST. WHAT DO YOU WANT? ARINA. WHO IS THIS? IT'S THE APPARITION. SHE RULES THE BURNING FOREST. IT'S A PLACE WORSE THAN HELL. IT HAS ITS CHARMS... AND IT OFFERS MUCH COMFORT TO SOMEONE IN YOUR  POSITION, MY DEAR. I'VE LEFT ITS BORDERS  IN ORDER TO SAVE YOU. SAVE HER FROM WHAT? LOSS, SORROW, DEATH. YOU'VE COME TO PROTECT ME  FROM KING VODEN? TO SAVE YOU FROM ALL WHO WOULD  INTERFERE WITH YOUR FATE. DON'T LISTEN TO HER. EVERYTHING SHE SAYS  IS A LIE. THESE MATTERS  DO NOT CONCERN THE REALMS OF ANIMALS OR MAN. THEY ARE NONE OF YOUR AFFAIR, BEASTMASTER. WELL, I'M MAKING THEM  MY AFFAIR. THAT'S REGRETTABLE. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... NONE OF THIS  IS NECESSARY, DAR. I MEAN ARINA NO HARM. INDEED...SHE IS PRECIOUS TO ME. SHE'S NOT GOING WITH YOU. THERE ARE MORE POWERFUL FORCES  AT WORK HERE THAN EVEN YOU AND I  CAN COMPREHEND, BEASTMASTER. JUST LIKE YOU COULDN'T  SAVE YOUR BELOVED... KYRA WHEN SHE WAS IN MORTAL DANGER? YOU CAN'T HOPE  TO WIN THIS BATTLE. THIS TIME HE'LL HAVE HELP. YOU DON'T KNOW  WHAT YOU'RE DOING. AND YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW  WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH. TAKE HER ALIVE AND KILL HIM. LET'S GO, DAR. YOU'RE ONLY DELAYING THE INEVITABLE, ARINA. YOU NEED ME. THE SENTINELS. YOU'RE LUCKY THEY DIDN'T  BREAK YOU IN HALF. IF ARINA HADN'T  BEEN THERE, THEY MIGHT HAVE. WE SAVED EACH  OTHER, REALLY. THERE'S NOTHING'S BROKEN. HOPE THEY DON'T  COME BACK TOO SOON. YOU'RE IN NO SHAPE TO FIGHT. DAR, IF THIS APPARITION IS THE SORCERESS YOU SAY SHE IS, WHY DOES SHE EVEN NEED WARRIORS? SHE WAS BANISHED  TO THE BURNING FOREST. I DON'T THINK HER POWERS  WORK OUTSIDE ITS BORDERS. THE SENTINELS MAY BE THE ONLY REAL  STRENGTH THAT SHE HAS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK  AND SO CLOSE TO XINCA? VODEN HAS A PRICE  ON YOUR HEAD. I LEFT SOMETHING BEHIND. A MARE IN HIS STABLES, CITIA. I BROUGHT HER WITH ME WHEN I JOINED VODEN'S CAMPAIGN. NAMIB'S HORSES ARE  THE BRAVEST ALIVE. VODEN BRED HER WITH  HIS FASTEST STALLION. HER FOAL IS MEANT  TO BE THE FIRST IN A GREAT LINE  OF CAVALRY MOUNTS. BACK THEN, I DIDN'T THINK THERE  WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT. NOW I THINK HER FOAL  DESERVES A BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE IN BATTLE... OR ASSIST IN THE TAKING  OF ANOTHER HUMAN LIFE. VODEN WON'T  GIVE HER UP. NO. I'LL HAVE TO TAKE HER. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? YEAH, I'M FINE. I'M... JUST A LITTLE TIRED. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS  IN THE MORNING, HUH? BY MORNING, YOU WILL BE  WHERE YOU BELONG, MY DEAR, AND EVERYTHING  WILL BE AS IT SHOULD. I WAS SUMMONED HERE. NOT A SUMMONS,  BUT A PLEA. YOU'RE THE ANCIENT ONE'S  NEW PROTEGE? I ONCE HAD THAT  SAME PRIVILEGE. MY PREDECESSOR'S  LOCKED IN AMBER. I PRECEDED HER BUT WAS BANISHED  TO A WORLD FAR, FAR AWAY, AND I HAVE LONGED EVER  SINCE FOR FORGIVENESS. I'M AFAID  OUR TEACHER IS NOT HERE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE  HE'S GONE AND FOR HOW LONG. SO I HEARD. PERHAPS HIS ABSENCE MEANS YOU WILL NOT SHARE  IN HIS PREJUDICE AGAINST ME. WHY DO YOU SEEK ME? THERE'S A WOMAN  OF THE FOREST, ARINA. PERHAPS YOU KNOW HER. YES, I'M AWARE OF HER. SHE'S IN GREAT DANGER. IN HIS FIT OF ANGER WITH ME, THE ANCIENT ONE RESTRICTED  MY POWERS HERE. SHE DESPERATELY NEEDS MY HELP. OUR HELP. WHAT SORT OF HELP? NOT MANY MOONS AGO,  AN EVIL SOUGHT TO POSSESS HER AND TAKE HER TO THE WORLD  BENEATH THE WORLD. BUT NOW SHE CARRIES THE SPAWN OF THAT EVIL. YES, AND UNLESS SHE COMES  TO THE SAFETY OF MY REALM, WHERE WE CAN PROTECT HER,  THE EVIL WILL RETURN. WELL, PERHAPS SHE'LL BE SAFE WITH ME. [ LAUGHING ] NO. YOU STILL HAVE  YOUR CRAFT TO LEARN. IN MY REALM, MY MAGIC  CAN PROTECT HER. WHY IS THIS CHILD  SO IMPORTANT TO YOU? BECAUSE OUR VERY  EXISTENCE DEPENDS ON WHO CONTROLS ITS DESTINY. I CAN'T INTERFERE  IN HUMAN AFFAIRS. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT. FOLLOWING THAT RULE  WILL BE FATAL FOR ARINA. AND ALSO THE BEASTMASTER. THE BEASTMASTER? HE STANDS AGAINST ME... OUT OF MISGUIDED  FRIENDSHIP, I'M SURE. BUT I WILL HAVE NO CHOICE  BUT TO STOP HIM IF HE INTERFERES AGAIN. SURELY THERE MUST BE  SOME WAY YOU COULD BEND OUR TEACHER'S ANCIENT RULES. LOOK AT HER, HJALMAR.  A NEW JEWEL IN OUR CROWN. YOU UNDERSTAND THE SUPERIORITY OF THE NAMIB HORSE, DO YOU NOT? OF COURSE -- THEY  KNOW BY INSTINCT WHAT OTHER BREEDS  MUST BE TAUGHT. THIS MARE WILL  REBUILD OUR CAVALRY INTO A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH. THAT WILL TAKE TIME. OUR SCOUTS REPORT ZAD'S REBELS  ARE ALREADY MOVING FROM  THE MOUNTAINS. WE DON'T NEED CAVALRY FOR ZAD. ZAD ONLY UNDERSTANDS  BRUTE FORCE. AGAINST OUR WALLS  UNTIL THE LAST MAN FALLS. THE ONLY PROBLEM  WE'LL HAVE WITH ZAD IS WHERE TO PILE  ALL THE BODIES. NO, THIS FOAL WILL CARRY US  TO NEW CONQUESTS. CITIA GROWS IN HER BELLY  OUR FUTURE. IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE DON'T HAVE A NAMIB HAND  TO COMPLETE THE TRAINING. ARINA IS A DESERTER -- SHE  ABANDONED US WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A WORD OF EXPLANATION. SHE WAS ALSO A FINE WARRIOR. FINE WARRIORS  AND FRIENDS KEEP YOUR SYMPATHY  FOR THOSE WHO DIE FOR ME, AND ALLOW ME TO GO AFTER  THOSE WHO RUN AWAY. SO WHAT PART OF  "STAY STILL AND REST" DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? I'M FEELING BETTER  THIS MORNING. THANKS TO MY POULTICE. IT WON'T DO YOU MUCH GOOD  UNLESS YOU STAY STILL. IF YOU DON'T WANT THE BENEFIT  OF MY KNOWLEDGE, FINE, THE SOONER YOU GET BETTER, THE  SOONER YOU CAN PROTECT ARINA. I THINK SHE'LL NEED IT. WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER? SHE WAS SICK  THIS MORNING, DAR. THERE'S SOMETHING  SHE'S NOT TELLING US. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? SCOUTING THE TRAIL TO XINCA. VODEN'S MEN ARE SEALING  OFF THE CITY. I THINK THEY'RE EXPECTING  AN ATTACK. MAYBE YOU SHOULD WAIT A WHILE,  RESCUE CITIA LATER. SHE'S DUE ANY DAY. I MUST TAKE  HER BEFORE SHE DROPS HER FOAL. THAT TUNNEL UNDER  THE WALL STILL SAFE? -YEAH.  -GOOD, I'LL BE GOING. WAIT, WAIT,  I'LL COME WITH YOU. IF VODEN'S EXPECTING ATTACK,  HIS MEN'LL BE READY. TAO, STAY HERE. WE'LL COME BACK  SOON WITH CITIA. DAR, I JUST-- FORGET IT. EVERY SOLDIER IN VODEN'S  ARMY IS HERE. I HADN'T COUNTED ON THIS. WE'LL NEVER GET CITIA  PAST ALL THESE GUARDS. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? SHE'LL COME TO YOU. GET READY. WHAT ABOUT YOU? I'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND HER. GO. THE TOWERS ARE SIMPLY TAKING  TOO LONG TO FINISH, HJALMAR. APPLY SOME DISCIPLINE. THE MARE IS FREE! ARINA! STOP HER! ARINA! NO! DO NOT HIT THE HORSE. IT MUST NOT BE HARMED. BRING HER BACK TO ME, AND BRING ME  THE MARE, UNDERSTAND? COME ON! WHO ARE YOU? A FRIEND. I DON'T KNOW YOU. BUT I KNOW YOU. I'VE COME TO HELP, ARINA. HELP ME? YOU'RE IN THE GRAVEST OF DANGER. I DON'T NEED YOUR HELP.  OR ANYONE ELSE'S. YOUR THOUGHTS ARE  WITH YOUR MARE. YOU SHOULD BE THINKING  OF YOURSELF. GET AWAY FROM ME. I WANT NOTHING  FROM YOU OR THAT DEMON. ARINA, IF YOU CAN'T THINK  OF YOURSELF, THINK OF THE FUTURE. I AM. AND NOW THERE WILL BE A FUTURE. WHERE'S DAR? HE'LL BE HERE SOON. WE TOOK HER WITHOUT A FIGHT. HER HEART'S RACING. SHE'S HAD A HARD RIDE.  WE BOTH HAVE. SHE'S WELL INTO HER PREGNANCY.  RUNNING HER WASN'T GOOD. TAO, WE REALLY DIDN'T  HAVE A CHOICE. ALL THE SAME-- MIND IF I KEEP  CHECKING HER OVER? ALL RIGHT. YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT, GIRL. WE BOTH WILL. WE MUST MOVE THE HORSE.  THE NORDS ARE CLOSE. THIS HORSE CAN'T  MOVE ANYWHERE. WHAT'S WRONG? THE FOAL'S TURNED THE WRONG WAY. A FOAL'S BORN HEAD FIRST,  FEET UP FRONT. THIS FOAL'S TURNED  THE OTHER WAY. IT MAY HAVE HAPPENED  DURING THE ESCAPE-- WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HER? IF THE FOAL DOESN'T  TURN AROUND, THEY'LL BOTH DIE  WHEN IT'S BORN. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. SHE'S ABOUT TO GO INTO LABOUR. NO. I'VE GOT TO TAKE  HER AWAY FROM HERE, DAR. VODEN'S MEN WILL  BE SWARMING ALL OVER THE FOREST AND THE APPARITION  MIGHT COME BACK. -I'LL COVER THE TRACKS.  -I'LL GET SOME WATER. NO, YOU TAKE CARE  OF HER. I'LL GET IT. I WILL. YOU  DON'T LOOK WELL. STOP WORRYING ABOUT ME.  LOOK AFTER HER. ARINA. WHAT IS WITH YOU TWO? CAN'T A GIRL HAVE AN OFF DAY  EVERY NOW AND AGAIN? IT'S SOMETHING.  SHE'S HIDING IT. I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW. STAY WITH CITIA. I'LL TALK  TO HER LATER. WHAT ARE WE GOING  TO DO WITH YOU? WELL, IT'S A GOOD  THING DAR ISN'T HERE. HE'D TRY TO STOP ME  FROM KILLING YOU. -YOU ALL RIGHT?  -YEAH. GOOD. LET'S GET MOVING. SHARAK SPOTTED THE NORDS.  WE HAVE TO DRAW THEM AWAY. DAR. WHAT'RE YOU DOING HERE?  WHERE'S ARINA? SHE JUST LEFT. WITH YOU. WHAT? YOU HEARD ME.  SHE JUST LEFT WITH... WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS YOU. IT'S THE APPARITION. IS SHE REALLY MY  TEACHER'S PROTEGE? I HAVE NO IDEA,  BUT I KNOW SHE RULES THE  BURNING FOREST. THEN I WAS RIGHT ABOUT HER. THE ANCIENT ONE  WOULD ONLY BANISH THE HARSHEST OF EVIL  TO SUCH A PLACE. WE HAVE TO REACH THEM BEOFRE  THEY GET TO ITS BORDERS. HOW MUCH FARTHER  MUST WE TAKE THEM? NOT MUCH. I WANT THEM AS FAR FROM TAO AND CITIA AS POSSIBLE. I SHOULD GET BACK TO CITIA. TAO WILL LOOK AFTER HER. BUT-- DON'T ARGUE WITH ME! NOW LET'S KEEP MOVING. YOU KNOW, YOU'D DO MUCH BETTER  IF YOU DRANK SOME OF THIS. IT WILL HELP TO RELAX YOU. SEE, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU --  IF YOU RELAX, MAYBE YOUR FOAL WILL TURN AROUND  TO ITS CORRECT POSITION. YOU CAN LEAD A HORSE TO WATER,  BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE IT DRINK. GUESS THAT APPLIES  FOR MEDICINE, TOO. TRY SOMETHING ELSE. IT'S SO STRANGE.  NO BIRDS, NO ANIMALS. THEY DON'T COME HERE. IT'S THE LAST PLACE  VODEN WOULD LOOK FOR YOU. WHERE ARE WE? ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST. WHICH PART? A SAFE ONE. DON'T WORRY,  YOU'RE TIRED. IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE  IN YOUR CONDITION. MY CONDITION? WHAT DO YOU KNOW  ABOUT MY CONDITION? THIS IS THE BURNING FOREST. YOU'RE NOT DAR. WHO ARE YOU? WELCOME TO MY DOMAIN. WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME? YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT. YOU'RE CARRYING SOMEONE  VERY PRECIOUS TO ME. YOUR LOVER'S LAST GIFT TO YOU. ORPHEO'S CHILD. -WHAT'S WRONG?  -I'M SORRY. I CAN FEEL MY STRENGTH  EBBING WITH EVERY STEP. THE BURNING FOREST  MUST BE CLOSE. YOUR POWERS WON'T WORK THERE? IF I ENTER, I'LL BE  NO USE TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE. GET BACK TO TAO AND  TELL HIM WHAT'S HAPPENING. I'LL FIND ARINA. WHY DO YOU  WANT MY CHILD? YOUR CHILD? THIS CHILD BELONGS TO THE WORLD. WHAT ARE YOU  TALKING ABOUT? A CHILD SIRED BY A DEAD MAN WILL HAVE  A SPECIAL UNDERSTANDING THIS CHILD YOU BEAR WILL  LEARN AT MY RIGHT HAND. AND IN TIME, ITS POWERS  WILL SURPASS ALL OTHERS. I MUST FIGHT YOU TO THE DEATH,  YOU WILL NOT HAVE MY CHILD. I CLAIM MY RIGHT TO IT AS  A SERVANT OF DARKNESS. ONE DAY, YOUR CHILD WILL DESTROY  THE GOODNESS OF THE WORLD, ONCE AND FOR ALL!  IF YOU ARE SMART... [ CHUCKLING ] YOU WILL JOIN US IN EMBRACING YOUR DESTINY. WHY RESIST YOUR FATE? THERE IS NO ESCAPE  FROM THIS PLACE. DO YOU NOT SEE THE HONOUR  BEARING THIS CHILD DOES YOU? OH...YOU CALL IT AN HONOUR  TO HAVE MY CHILD STOLEN FROM ME  AND TURNED INTO A MONSTER? CHOOSE YOUR WORDS  CAREFULLY, ARINA. THIS CHILD IS WHAT IT IS. IT WILL BE A SALVATION TO OTHERS SUCH AS I, AND HAVE THE POWER TO GRANT YOU  ETERNAL LIFE. YES, ORPHEO OFFERED ME THAT  AS WELL AND I REJECTED IT -- AND HIM, I LOVED. YOU WILL NOT LOVE YOUR CHILD? ORPHEO OFFERED YOU  LIFE AFTER DEATH. YOUR OFFSPRING WILL GRANT YOU  LIFE WITHOUT DEATH. AND WHAT WILL IT GRANT YOU, BESIDES GREAT POWERS  OF DESTRUCTION? PERHAPS THE POWER TO RAISE  THE DEAD, AND RETURN ORPHEO TO YOUR SIDE. WHAT MOTHER  WOULD DENY HER CHILD THE RIGHT TO GRANT  SUCH HAPPINESS? NO...SERVING YOU WOULD BE A LIVING DEATH. YOU WILL NEVER  HAVE MY CHILD -- NEVER! THIS IS MY WORLD, ARINA.  YOU HAVE NO CHOICE! I WILL NURTURE THE GOOD  IN MY CHILD, NOT THE EVIL. CHASE HER, YOU FOOLS! THERE'S NO TRACE OF THE HORSE. BUT ARINA AND THE BEASTMASTER WENT THIS WAY. YOU TWO, SCOUR THE AREA  FOR THE HORSE. THEY'VE PROBABLY  GOT HER HIDDEN. THE REST OF YOU COME WITH ME. HURRY UP, YOU FOOLS. SHE MUST NOT ESCAPE MY FOREST. UP THERE. STOP HER. YOU, GO AROUND. WAIT. ARINA! DON'T DO THIS. YOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT ACROSS. [ SCREAMING ] NO! YOU CANNOT DIE. YOU DO NOT HAVE MY PERMISSION. ARINA. IT'S ME. HOW CAN I BE SURE? IT'S ME. COME ON. GOOD GIRL. IT MIGHT BE A CASE OF  TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE. THE BIRTH'S ABOUT TO START. ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T HELP ME? BUT YOU HELPED  US BOTH BEFORE. BEFORE I KNEW MY PLACE,  YES, BUT NOW... SO, DOES THIS RULE EXTEND  TO THE AFFAIRS OF HOSRES? I'M AFRAID IT DOES. [ SIGHING ] JUST LIKE I WAS  SAYING YESTERDAY. FATE KEEPS SENDING ME IN  DIRECTIONS I NEVER EXPECT. JUST A LITTLE FURTHER AND  WE'LL BE FREE OF THIS PLACE. IT DOESN'T MATTER. SHE'LL  ONLY COME AFTER ME AGAIN. YOU DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE STORY. THEN TELL ME. I CAN'T. ARINA, I CAN'T  PROTECT YOU IF I DON'T KNOW WHAT DANGER  YOU'RE UP AGAINST. DAR, PLEASE. WE'RE FRIENDS, RIGHT? AFTER ALL WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,  ALL THAT'S HAPPENED, THERE'S NOTHING  YOU CAN'T TELL ME. I'M PREGNANT. WHOSE IS IT? ORPHEO. HE WAS NOT DEAD  WHEN HE WALKED THIS WORLD. NOW, I WILL BEAR  A VERY SPECIAL CHILD, THAT THE APPARITION WANTS  TO TURN TO EVIL. I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN,  DAR. IT'S A CHILD OF LOVE. THEN IT'LL BECOME WHAT YOU WANT,  NOT WHAT THE APPARITION WANTS. I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT. ARINA, WE JUST SAVED CITIA FROM VODEN... SO WE CAN STOP YOUR CHILD FROM FALLING INTO  THE APPARITION'S HANDS. ALL RIGHT? [ CRASHING ] THEY'RE COMING. YOU'RE IN NO SHAPE  TO HOLD THEM OFF BY YOURSELF. GO, WHILE YOU STILL  HAVE A CHANCE, GO. GIVE THEM SOMETHING  EXTRA FOR ME. GO. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. WHERE'S ARINA? -SHE'S NOT WITH YOU?  -NO. VODEN'S GOT HER. WELCOME HOME. I SERVED YOU  WELL, VODEN. I'VE DONE NOTHING  TO DESERVE THIS. BESIDES ABANDONING YOUR POST,  BETRAYING MY TRUST AND STEALING MY HORSE. CITIA IS MY HORSE.  I BROUGHT HER TO YOU. AND WHEN YOU DID,  SHE BECAME MINE. AS DID YOU. WHERE IS THE HORSE? SHE WAS ALONE  WHEN WE FOUND HER. THEN YOUR JOB IS ONLY HALF DONE. TAKE HER TO HER CELL. I'LL NEED TIME TO DESIGN A SUITABLE HOMECOMING. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SHE'S GOING TO  HAVE THE FOAL. WELL, IT'S STILL BACKWARDS,  BUT...IT'S COMING. THE ONLY WAY I CAN TURN  THE FOAL AROUND NOW IS TO... THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN  DO ANYTHING IS YOU, TAO. WHY ARE YOU  DOING THIS, HJALMAR? WHY ARE YOU STILL HELPING HIM? HE'S MY KING. OH... HE GROWS MORE UNSTABLE  WITH EACH DAY. SURELY THE EVIL  THAT HE IS SPREADING WAS NOT HOW YOU ENVISIONED  YOUR LIFE WOULD BE. NO...BUT IT'S MY DUTY. TO WHO? MY MEN. [ SIGHING ] A GREAT ARMY IS BEING MOBILIZED TO ATTACK US. THAT'S WHY  THE CITY IS BEING WITHOUT ME, THERE'S  NO ONE TO STOP VODEN FROM SENDING OUT OUR  SOLDIERS TO BE SLAUGHTERED. JUST LIKE HE SLAUGHTERS TOY SOLDIERS PLAYING MOCK  DREAMS OF GLORY IN HIS TENT. HE CAN'T BE TRUSTED, HJALMAR. SHHH. IT'S BEEN HARD  HERE WITHOUT YOU. IT'S BEEN HARD HAVING  NO ONE...SANE TO TALK TO. [ ARINA ]: WE FOUGHT  MANY BATTLES SIDE BY SIDE. WHAT YOU FAIL TO APPRECIATE,  ARINA, IS THAT I TRUSTED YOU. I ALLOWED YOU TO KNOW ME  AS NO ONE ELSE DOES. I DID NOT WISH TO BECOME  YOUR ENEMY, KING VODEN. I CAME HERE AS A FREE WOMAN --  I FELT I HAD THE RIGHT TO LEAVE  THE SAME WAY. WHY? YOU WERE POWERFUL, FEARED. I NEVER WANTED TO BE FEARED. I ONLY WANTED TO BE FREE. I'M NOT A THREAT TO YOU. I WILL NOT BE A THREAT  TO YOU IF YOU LET ME GO. I MIGHT BE PREPARED TO MAKE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH YOU. WHAT KIND OF  ARRANGEMENT? YOUR LIFE FOR THE MARE. NO. YOU REFUSE. WHY? YOU SAID IT  YOURSELF. I KNOW YOU. AND I KNOW I CAN  NEVER TRUST YOU. YOU CHOOSE DEATH OVER MERCY. YOU'LL HAVE YOUR OWN WAY. HJALMAR, COME WITH ME. HJALMAR. WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO? REACH INSIDE, FIND THE HEAD  AND THE HOOVES, AND PUT THEM IN  THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WHAT'S WRONG? I DON'T WANT TO FAIL. THEN DON'T. I'M GIVING YOU THE CHANCE  TO EARN YOUR FREEDOM, ARINA. AND MY GENERAL A CHANCE TO PROVE HIS LOYALTY. LET'S SEE WHICH MATTERS MORE, YOUR FREEDOM  OR THE LIVES OF MY MEN. LET'S BEGIN. [ SHOUTING ] TOGETHER, WE CAN TAKE HIM OUT. ONCE VODEN IS DEAD,  OTHERS WILL FOLLOW YOU. WE'D NEVER GET OUT OF HERE I'M SORRY, ARINA, BUT IT'S YOUR LIFE OR THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS. I HAVE NO CHOICE,  AND NEITHER DO YOU. THEY WANT  ACTION, HJALMAR. DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS. IT'S THE ONLY WAY...AHH! NOW, KING VODEN, I HAVE AN OFFER FOR YOU. MY LIFE...FOR THE LIFE OF YOUR GENERAL'S. WELL...THIS  IS A DIFFICULT DECISION. BUT SOMETIMES, WE NEED TO KNOW  WHO OUR FRIENDS REALLY ARE, DON'T WE? JUST MAKE IT QUICK. TAKE HER TO HER CELL. YOU ALL RIGHT?  DID THEY HURT YOU? NO, I'M ALL RIGHT. HERE, PUT THIS ON. LET'S GO. CHECK DOWN THERE. THEY WERE HERE. COME ON, GO, GO, GO, MOVE. QUICKLY...OVER THE WALL. THANK YOU. I'M NOT...ENTIRELY  WITHOUT HONOUR. BUT IF WE MEET AGAIN... YOU COULD HAVE  KILLED HJALMAR. WHAT STOPPED YOU? YOU'RE HAVING A BAD  INFLUENCE ON ME. YOU DID WELL...  BOTH OF YOU. AND AFTER WHAT YOU'VE  BEEN THROUGH, MY DEAR, I HOPE YOU'VE RECONSIDERED  YOUR SITUATION. YES, I HAVE. I'VE DECIDED THAT  THE LIFE OF MY CHILD, LIKE THE LIFE  OF MY MARE'S FOAL, -WITH ANYONE ELSE.  -VODEN WON'T STOP  CHASING YOU. WE KNOW YOU WON'T EITHER. DAR. I'VE BEEN DOING SOME THINKING ABOUT THE PENALTY  FOR INTERFERENCE. THE ANCIENT ONE FORBIDS YOU TO  USE EVEN THAT PATHETIC TRICK OUTSIDE YOUR OWN TERRITORY. YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN, MY GIRL. I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. YOU'VE FAILED.  GIVE UP AND GO HOME. I NEVER FAIL. AND THIS  ISN'T MY FIGHT TO SURRENDER. BUT YOU CAN STILL GO HOME. AND I'D GO NOW, WHILE I COULD,  IF I WERE YOU. THE ANCIENT ONE  DECREED THAT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO MEDDLE  IN THEIR WORLD, BUT HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD STOP ME  FROM DOING A JOB ON YOURS. THIS IS NOT OVER, ARINA. IT'S ONLY JUST BEGINNING. GET BACK TO THE CAMP,  AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. CITIA. AH, YOU JUST MISSED  ALL THE ACTION. WE HAD A LITTLE  FUN OF OUR OWN. WHERE'S CITIA? HOW IS SHE? COME ON,  I'LL SHOW YOU. OH, LOOK AT YOU. EVERYTHING'S HOW  IT'S SUPPSOED TO BE. HOW'D YOU DO IT? HA...I USED MY KNOWLEDGE. BUT INSTEAD OF USING IT  ON SOMETHING GREAT OR NOBLE, I USED IT ON SOMETHING  THAT SEEMS SO EVERYDAY... BUT COULDN'T BE  MORE MIRACULOUS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S  THE FUNNY THING ABOUT FATE. IT ALWAYS TAKES US EXACTLY  WHERE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH  I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.
