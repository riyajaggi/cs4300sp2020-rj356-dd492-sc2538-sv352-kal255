  WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THIS  TRAIL FOR QUITE A WHILE, DAR. HOW CAN YOU BE SURE  THAT A TIGER YOU'VE NEVER MET  NEEDS YOUR HELP? IT'S IGNORING PREY  IT'D NORMALLY HUNT. TELLS ME  IT'S SICK. JUST THINK  ABOUT HOW MUCH IT'LL APPRECIATE  WHAT WE'VE PERSONALLY, I THINK TIGER'S  LOOK DOWN ON ME AS MEAT. WHY DO YOU  THINK THAT? BECAUSE THEY'RE TIGERS...  AND I'M MEAT. YOU'RE SLOW, TOO.

 AND EASY TO SNEAK UP ON. YOU'RE A LONG WAY  FROM WATER, IARA. THERE'S MORE TO LIFE  THAN WATER, DAR... TELL YOU WHAT, WHY DON'T YOU  SEND YOUR LITTLE FRIEND ON UP AHEAD AND I'LL  TELL YOU SOME MORE. TAO, WAIT. OHH...COME ON, DAR. NATURE'S HUMMING ALONG SMOOTHLY MY CREATURES ARE HAPPY. THE BIRDS ARE HAPPY... AND THE BEES... THERE'S TIME TO SPEND  A LITTLE TIME TOGETHER. IARA...WHEN ARE YOU  GOING TO UNDERSTAND?

 I HAVE NO PLACE IN MY LIFE  FOR THE KIND OF FRIENDSHIP-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA  WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU... RIGHT, WELL, I'M GOING  TO HEAD OFF DOWN THIS WAY. KEEP WALKING, TAO,  WE'LL BE A WHILE. NO, WE WON'T -- WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO UNDERSTAND  THAT I'M NOT INTERESTED? NOTHING WILL EVER  HAPPEN BETWEEN US, NO MATTER HOW MUCH YOU WANT  TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE. SO, PLEASE, JUST GO AND DO WHAT IT IS THAT YOU DO  AND JUST LEAVE ME ALONE. THAT THERE'S NOTHING MORE DANGEROUS THAN A WOMAN SCORNED. TAO, SHE'S NOT A WOMAN. NO, SOMETHING THAT  COULD GET EVEN ANGRIER. THAT'S AS GENTLE AS I COULD BE.  SHE'LL HAVE TO UNDERSTAND. I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU MAY HAVE  PAINTED A TARGET ON YOUR BACK. I ASKED HIM NOT TO DISHONOUR  HIMSELF BY HUNTING MAN. LEAVE IT. HE SAID MEN DRESSED LIKE YOU  TRAPPED AND INJURED HIM. A TIGER THAT CAN'T HUNT  BECOMES A MAN-EATER. WE'RE EASIER TO CATCH. I OWE YOU A DEBT. REPAY ME BY NOT HUNTING IN HIS FOREST ANY MORE...  BECAUSE IF HIS INJURY PREVENTS HIM FROM  CATCHING ANYTHING ELSE, HE'LL COME BACK FOR YOU. I'LL REMEMBER THAT. ARE WE STILL  FOLLOWING THIS TIGER? I TOLD HIM I'D HELP HIM. YOU SAVED A HUMAN FROM A DEATH  HE DESERVED -DENYING A HUNGRY  TIGER HIS MEAL.  -IARA. THE HUMAN YOU SAVED  KILLED A DEER. YOU VALUE HUMANS MORE  THAN ME AND MY ANIMALS. YOU WERE MADE SPECIAL,  BUT YOU USE YOUR POWERS TO PUT YOUR KIND  ABOVE MY CREATURES! -THAT'S NOT TRUE.  -FROM NOW ON, I  TAKE YOUR GIFT. YOU WILL NO LONGER SPEAK  TO THOSE YOU LOVE TOO LITTLE! YOU FOOL! NOW NO BEAST WILL KNOW  YOUR THOUGHTS... AND YOU WILL NO LONGER  HEAR THEIRS. YOU ARE NO LONGER  THE BEASTMASTER. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... THE LITTLE DEMON  OVERSTEPS HER BOUNDS AGAIN. FISRT SHE IMPRISONS  THE DEMON CURUPIRA, WHICH SHE HAS  NO BUSINESS DOING, IARA? WHO ELSE? THEN SHE DISRUPTS ALL THINGS  NATURAL -- AND WHY? BECAUSE HE REJECTED  HER PATHETIC ADVANCES AND HURT HER PRECIOUS FEELINGS. DID SHE KILL HIM? NO -- SHE TOOK AWAY HIS POWER. NOW MY WORLD  HAS NO BEASTMASTER. HE WAS THE BALANCE,  SHE TIPPED IT. DEMONS CAN DO JUST ABOUT  ANYTHING -- EXCEPT POSSIBLY, THINK WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN THEY DO  JUST ABOUT ANYTHING. SO, NOW DAR IS JUST LIKE  ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING. UNTIL SHE CHANGES HER MIND  AND RETURNS HIS POWER. WELL, SHE'S NEVER  DONE THAT BEFORE. OTHERWISE, TERRIBLE THINGS  ARE GOING TO HAPPEN. WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP? AND NO MATTER WHAT SHE SAYS,  BRING HER TO ME. IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND. THINGS GO ALONG AND IT FEELS LIKE IT CAN'T BE ANY OTHER WAY. BUT IT CAN. SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WE HAD LIVES BEFORE  I WAS GRANTED MY POWERS. MAYBE IARA WILL HAVE  A CHANGE OF HEART. I WOULDN'T  COUNT ON IT. DO YOU FEEL ANY DIFFERENT? NO. BUT SO MUCH SOUND IS GONE. I NEVER REALIZED  HOW MUCH I HEARD BEFORE. SHE CAN'T DO THIS. SHE ALREADY HAS, TAO. MAYBE SOMEONE  CAN HELP US. THE SORCERESS WHO FIXED YOUR STAFF. WE COULD REACH CURUPIRA. NO...WHAT'S DONE IS DONE. I'LL JUST HAVE TO  GET USED TO IT. SO THAT'S IT?  THE END OF THE BEASTMASTER. NO, IT'S NOT. I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK  WITH ANIMALS, BUT IT'S NOT THE END OF MAINTAINING  THE BALANCE OF NATURE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MY PEOPLE -- THE SULAS -- YOU KNOW THAT THEY RESPECTED  NATURE AND PROTECTED ANIMALS. I'M STILL A SULA.  SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. BUT THEY CAN'T UNDERSTAND YOU  AND YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THEM. BUT I'M STILL ME. I'M WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE. I'M DOING WHAT I'M MEANT TO DO. I'M NOT GOING TO STOP. [ SCREAMING ] TALK TO ME. PLEASE, I'M TELLING  THE TRUTH. I FOUND  THAT IVORY. NO, NO, NO, A MAN  FINDS A BROKEN SHARD, A TUSK, TWO AT THE MOST. BUT YOU HAD ENOUGH  IVORY IN YOUR WAGON TO OUTFIT A SMALL  HERD OF ELEPHANTS. THERE'S NO LAW  AGAINST HUNTING. AND NO SINGLE HUNTER  WHO CAN BRING DOWN SO MANY OF THE GREAT BEASTS. [ SCREAMING ] STOP TRYING TO FIND YOUR MISGOTTEN FORTUNE -- IT'S LOST! AS YOU WILL BE, IF YOU DON'T TELL ME THE TRUTH. GOOD EVENING, HJALMAR. THE ELEPHANT'S GRAVEYARD --  YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS AND YOU WILL TELL ME. [ WHIMPERING ] [ SCREAMING ] THERE'S A PATH  THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS... BENEATH THE WATERFALL. WHERE? HERE? GOOD. KILL HIM. [ SHRIEKING ] THE ELEPHANT'S GRAVEYARD. I NEVER BELIEVED IT WAS REAL. THERE'S ENOUGH IVORY TO PAY  FOR A HUNDRED CAMPAIGNS. WHAT ABOUT THE STORIES? THEY SAY THE GROUND  IS COVERED IN TUSKS. THEY SAY YOU SUFFER THE WRATH OF THE GODS  IF YOU DISTURB THEM. [ SCREAMING ] HA...PERHAPS THAT'S TRUE. I'LL FIND ANOTHER,  IF YOU'RE AFRAID. YOUR WISH IS MY COMMAND. MAKE SURE I FEEL THAT WAY  WHEN YOU RETURN. [ TWIG SNAPPING ] -WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?  -I PROMISED TO HELP HIM. HOW WILL YOU DO THAT NOW? DAR. IT'S NO USE. HE'S TOO HUNGRY.  I CAN'T REACH HIM. YOU'RE GOING TO FIGHT HIM? HIS HUNGER'S DRIVING HIM CRAZY. STAY BEHIND ME, TAO. RUH, AM I GLAD TO SEE YOU. WHAT'S GOING ON? HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND. HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S  GOING TO ATTACK. NO...HE KNOWS IT'S US. HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND  WHY I WON'T TALK. GOODBYE, MY FRIEND. I DON'T KNOW WHY  YOU'RE SO UPSET. IT'S MY REALM  I'LL DO AS I LIKE. IT MUST BE WONDERFUL TO BE THE ONLY PERSON  IN THE WORLD WHO MATTERS. HE'S ONLY A HUMAN. WHEN ONE FORM OF MAGIC  IS INTERFERED WITH, ALL FORMS BECOME UNSTABLE. FOR EVERY ACTION, THERE IS AN EQUAL  AND OPPOSITE... NEVER MIND. THE POINT IS, YOU'VE STARTED SOMETHING THAT  WILL HURT YOU -MORE THAN IT WILL HURT HIM.  -WHAT? THAT WILL SAP OUR MAGIC  UNTIL THERE IS NO MORE MAGIC. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? FORGIVE HIM. CHANGE YOUR MIND. GIVE HIM BACK THE ABILITY  TO SPEAK WITH THE ANIMALS. YOU ASK TOO MUCH. -IT'S THE ONLY WAY.  -NO! HE HAS TO LEARN THAT HE BELONGS TO ME! HE HAS TO BEND TO MY WILL. VERY WELL. BUT DON'T PLAN  ON ANY SPECTACULAR -SPELLS IN THE FUTURE.  -WHY? BECAUSE ONE THING OUT OF  BALANCE LEADS TO ANOTHER. THE PROCESS IS ALREADY  IN MOTION. IF IT CAN'T BE STOPPED,  IT WILL MEAN THE END OF US, AND THEREFORE,  THE END OF OUR WORLD. I ENVY YOUR JOURNEY AND LOOK  FORWARD TO YOUR RETURN. ALL IN YOUR  NAME, MILORD. THINK OF IT -- A HUNDRED  CAMPAIGNS WITH ENOUGH RICHES TO PAY FOR SO MANY  WARRIORS AND WEAPONS THAT NO ARMY IN THE WORLD  WILL DARE STAND AGAINST US. NO ONE DARES TO STAND  AGAINST US NOW. AND LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY. I THOUGHT WE WERE  GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE. DOES YOUR MAGIC FALTER ALREADY? NO. MY MAGIC WILL BE  THE LAST TO GO. BUT I HAD TO SEE  THIS FOR MYSELF. OUR SITUATION'S MORE  DESPERATE THAN I THOUGHT. MORE DESPERATE THAN  THE LOSS OF THIS WORLD? HA, WORLD'S COME AND GO --  AS LONG AS THE MEMORY OF HOW TO MAKE THEM REMAINS,  ALL IS NOT LOST. -THE MEMORY?  -YES. AND THAT TOO IS  IN GREAT DANGER. WELL...WHAT SHOULD WE DO? THE ONLY THING  WE CAN DO. INTERFERE. DAR, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE  A LOT TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW, BUT...CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION? SURE. I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S YOUR JOB AS A SULA TO PROTECT THE ANIMALS, BUT THERE ARE ANIMALS HERE. WHY ARE WE GOING OVER THERE? WALKING HELPS ME THINK. THINKING -- THAT I UNDERSTAND,  BUT WE'RE WANDERING AIMLESSLY IN THE PURSUIT OF NOTHING. I DON'T THINK I'D  AGREE WITH THAT. IT'S YOU. YES...I'M  AFRAID SO. I BELIEVE YOU'VE ALREADY MET  MY ASSOCIATE. YES. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? I CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH  THE ANIMALS ANY MORE. WE KNOW. YOU MAY FIND THIS HARD  TO BELIEVE, BUT WE'RE AS UNHAPPY ABOUT THAT AS YOU. PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO. YOU COULD HELP. YOU HAVE  POWERFUL MAGIC. I'VE SEEN IT. I CAN ONLY HELP THOSE  WHO HELP THEMSELVES. SO DAR CAN GET HIS GIFT BACK. YES... YOU CAN RECOVER YOUR POWERS BY EARNING THEM  AS YOU DID ONCE BEFORE. DOES THAT MEAN I MUST ENDURE  CURUPIRA'S TEST AGAIN. NO...BUT YOU MUST PASS  THREE VERY DEMANDING TESTS... TO SHOW YOUR DEDICATION  TO THE ANIMALS, YOUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE  GREAT SACRIFICE FOR THEM. AND TO PROVE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS  KEEP YOUR WORD TO THOSE YOU WERE  CHOSEN TO PROTECT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? YES. WHAT ARE THE TASKS? THEY'LL PRESENT  THEMSELVES TO YOU. ONE TASK EACH FOR DEDICATION,  SACRIFICE AND WORD OF HONOUR. SUCCEED AND YOU'LL HAVE  YOUR GIFT BACK ONCE MORE. FAIL AND THE ANIMALS  WILL TREAT YOU AS THEY WOULD  ANY OTHER HUMAN... FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. TELL ME WHAT I MUST DO. MY SORCERESS WILL OBSERVE TO  MAKE SURE YOU PASS EACH TASK. -WHY?  -WELL, YOURS ISN'T AND YOUR POWERS AREN'T THE ONLY  ONES THAT MAY DISAPPEAR. REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. GUIDE, BUT DO NOT HELP. EASIER SAID  THAN DONE. THERE IS NO ROOM  FOR ERROR HERE. THE BEASTMASTER MUST PERFORM  EACH TASK HIMSELF; OTHERWISE, THE GIFT  CAN NEVER BE RETURNED. DAR, I HAVE A QUESTION. WHY'S SHARAK  STAYING SO CLOSE WHEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN  TO HIM ALL DAY? SOMETIMES ANIMALS CAN SENSE WHEN SOMETHING'S WRONG. MAYBE HE'S JUST STICKING AROUND  TO SEE IF HE CAN HELP. YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT HE SEES  ANY MORE. WHAT HELP CAN HE BE? SOMETIMES, TAO,  FRIENDS JUST HELP BY BEING THERE,  YOU KNOW? YEAH, I KNOW. I KNOW. TAO. OH. THE ROGUE TIGER WAS HERE. WELL, THEN, MAYBE  WE SHOULDN'T BE. THIS COULD BE MY FIRST TASK. OH, DAR. HE SAID I MUST  TEST MY DEDICATION. I HAVE NEVER  MET A MAN MORE DEDICATED TO HELPING  A ROGUE TIGER THAT'S DEDICATED  TO EATING HIM. COME ON, LET'S KEEP GOING. I'M AFRAID THE SORCERESS' DEVICE  IS FAILING ON HER. THAT'S HER  PROBLEM. MY MAGIC IS AS STRONG AS EVER. OH, REALLY? LOOK BEYOND THE EDGE. AND WATCH IT RAIN. PERFECT WEATHER FOR A PICNIC. HOW DOES IT FEEL TO LOSE  ONE'S SPECIAL GIFT? YOU CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN. I DIDN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN. IS IT TIME TO CHANGE YOUR MIND? NOTHING'S HAPPENING. PERHAPS YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE  THAT WHEN YOU HAD YOUR POWERS. MAYBE CURUPIRA COULD HELP. IF I CAN'T DO THIS... THEN I CAN'T  RELEASE HER EITHER. IT JUST GETS WORSE  AND WORSE, DOESN'T IT? WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? WE CAN'T  DO ANYTHING. THE BEASTMASTER  IS OUR ONLY HOPE. BUT NOW, THANKS TO YOU, HE'S MORE VULNERABLE THAN HE'S EVER BEEN. [ CAWING ] WHY IS HE CALLING US? MAYBE HE'S FOUND  THE ROGUE TIGER. HOW'D HE  GET IN HERE? MAYBE HE WAS  OVERWHELMED BY THIRST. OR TRYING TO ESCAPE  FROM A LION OR A CROCODILE. DOESN'T MATTER. WE HAVE TO  FIGURE A WAY TO GET HIM OUT. HE'LL NEVER  MAKE IT OUT. LET ME GUESS.  HE'LL MAKE IT OUT. THIS COULD BE MY FIRST TASK. HE SAID I MUST  TEST MY DEDICATION. ALL RIGHT, I CAN GO IN HERE. DAR, IF YOU GO IN WITH HIM,  YOU MIGHT GET STUCK WITH HIM. I HAVE TO GET HIM OUT, TAO. OH, JUST BE WARY OF THE HORNS.  THEY CAN TEAR A MAN IN HALF BRING ME SOME BRANCHES.  I NEED SOME WOOD. IT'S ALL RIGHT. NO ONE'S GOING TO HURT YOU. I'LL PUT WOOD UNDER YOUR FEET,  FOR SOMETHING TO STAND ON. TAO. DON'T PANIC. IT'S ALL RIGHT. EASY. CAREFUL. DO YOU NEED MORE WOOD? YES. I'LL GET YOUR STAFF...  GIVE YOU A HAND. PLEASE. TAO, DON'T MOVE. JUST DON'T MOVE. TAO, DON'T MOVE. JUST DON'T MOVE. LET ME SEE YOU'RE WONDERING IF I HAVE A SENSE OF FAIR PLAY  AND HONOUR. TO TELL THE TRUTH, I DO. AND I AM SAVING YOU BECAUSE  OF WHAT YOU DID FOR ME. OF COURSE THIS MAKES US EVEN. KING VODEN WILL BE  AS GLAD TO SEE YOU TWO AS HE WILL BE THE IVORY  I'M BRINGING HIM. HE DID PASS THE FIRST TEST. NOW HE ONLY HAS TWO MORE. I'M AFRAID HE MAY  STILL BE TOO LATE. THIS IS AN UNEXPECTED  COMPLICATION. IT APPEARS YOUR MAGIC  FADES MORE AND MORE. BUT YOU'RE NOT OUT OF TRICKS. NOT YET. BUT I WILL BE AFFECTED SOON. THE NORDS ARE GETTING NEARER  TO THE ELEPHANT'S GRAVEYARD. WHAT DOES THAT  HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? IF THEY TAKE THE IVORY, A LOT MORE WILL BE LOST  THAN MY POWERS. YOU HAVE SOME CONNECTION  WITH THE ELEPHANTS? YES, WE'RE A LOT ALIKE. UNFLAPPABLE, TIMELESS  AND WITH A TOUCH OF NOBILITY. BUT LIKE ME,  ELEPHANTS NEVER FORGET. UNLESS? UNLESS... THEIR SACRED GROUND  IS DESECRATED AND THEIR IVORY TAKEN. THEN THEIR MEMORY'S  LEAVE FOREVER, AS WILL THE MEMORY'S I NEED TO SAVE THIS WORLD  FROM SINKING INTO CHAOS. THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE  TO LOSE, MY DEAR... WHEN THE BALANCE IS DISTURBED. YOU NEED TO EAT. WE'VE STILL  GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. YOU WILL WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY.  I WON'T LET YOU STARVE. KING VODEN DETERMINES WHAT  IS OF VALUE AND WHAT ISN'T. THEN HE'D BE WRONG. DAR'S LOST HIS POWER. HA, HA, YOU EXPECT  ME TO BELIEVE THAT? AND YOU CAN'T STEAL  THE IVORY FROM THE ELEPHANTS' GRAVEYARD --  THE LEGEND SAYS-- I KNOW WHAT THE LEGEND SAYS. THE DOOM IT PREDICTS IS NOTHING  COMPARED TO VODEN'S WRATH IF I DON'T BRING  THE IVORY BACK. HMM? DO YOU THINK THE LEGENDS  WILL COME TRUE? NATURE'S SLIPPING  OUT OF BALANCE. THESE MEN ARE GOING  TO DESTROY A PLACE THAT NO MAN SHOULD EVEN SEE. TAO, TO SET FOOT THERE IS ONE THING,  BUT TO STEAL FROM IT... WHAT CAN WE DO? YOU CAN'T CALL RUH. SHARAK CAN'T  COME DOWN AND... I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. -BUT YOUR HANDS ARE TIED.  -WE'LL SEE. HJALMAR, CAN I HAVE  SOME WATER, PLEASE? THANKS FOR THE DRINK. I CAN'T HEAR THEM  BEHIND US ANY MORE. THEY MUST HAVE GIVEN UP. WE'RE NOT AS VALUABLE AS IVORY. THEY GAVE UP BECAUSE OF ME. I PUT A COUPLE OF SNAKES  IN THEIR PATH. LITTLE ONES... NOT EVEN POISONOUS. IT'S ALL I COULD DO. I THINK YOU'VE  ALREADY DONE ENOUGH. I'VE PROBABLY STILL GOT  ENOUGH MAGIC LEFT TO DEAL WITH THE LIKES OF YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT, IARA? SHE WANTS TO OFFER WHAT YOU AND I  WOULD CALL AN APOLOGY. ONLY IT'S A CONCEPT  FOREIGN TO HER NATURE. [ HISSING ] I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I THINK I'VE WORKED OUT WHAT DAR'S SECOND TASK IS. IT HAS TO DO WITH  THE ELEPHANTS, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW. THE DECISIONS HE MAKES  MUST BE HIS, NOT OURS. YOU HAVE TWO MORE TASKS. SACRIFICE AND KEEPING MY WORD. IT MUST BE DONE BEFORE THE  NORDS REACH THE GRAVEYARD. IT WOULD HELP. SO DAR MUST COMPLETE THE TASKS AND TAKE ON A COMPANY  OF NORDS AS WELL? THE BALANCE HAS BEEN DISTURBED. OUR POWERS ARE FAILING, DAR. IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING...  THEN WE'RE ALL LOST. AND WHOSE FAULT WOULD THAT BE? TAO, DON'T. LET'S GO. I WISH WE COULD  RESTORE YOUR POWERS... AND LEAVE HERS TURNED OFF. I DON'T UNDERSTAND  WHY THEY CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE TASKS ARE. THEY'RE HARD ENOUGH TO  ACCOMPLISH WITHOUT THE-- WHAT DOES IT WANT WITH US? IT'S STILL HUNGRY. IT'S ONLY CAPABLE  OF HUNTING MAN. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? HOLD THIS... AND THIS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THE SECOND TASK IS SACRIFICE. CURUPIRA FED MY BODY  TO THE ANIMALS. MAYBE IT HAS  TO HAPPEN AGAIN. THE DEMON AND THE SORCERESS'  POWER IS FAILING. IT COULD FAIL  WHEN MOST NEEDED? DAR, THIS IS SUICIDE! TAKE WHAT YOU WANT. NO, WE CAN'T LET THIS HAPPEN! DAR, PLEASE DON'T-- SHH! HOW COULD YOU LET THIS HAPPEN? THE DECISION WAS HIS. AND HE MADE THE RIGHT DECISION. -HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT? SHE--  -QUIET! I MUST BEGIN. -IS THIS WORKING?  -I WILL NOT HAVE YOUR HUMAN EMOTIONS INTRUDING HERE! YOU DIDN'T FREEZE HIM. IS YOUR POWER FAILING TOO? THIS IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. YOU CAN'T SAVE HIM. [ GASPING ] YOUR TASK OF SACRIFICE  IS COMPLETE. SHOULD YOU PASS THE NEXT TEST,  YOUR POWERS WILL BE RETURNED. MY WORD OF HONOUR. LET'S HOPE IT  PRESENTS ITSELF SOON. I THINK IT ALREADY HAS. TAO...WE HAVE TO HURRY. RIGHT, WHERE ARE WE GOING? TO THE ELEPHANT GRAVEYARD.  COME ON, THERE'S NO TIME. WE HAVE TO HURRY. I NEED TO REST. I'LL TAKE YOU. LET ME HELP YOU. NO. YOU FOLLOW THEM. YOU STILL HAVE  UNFINISHED BUSINESS. ARE WAY AHEAD OF US NOW --  WE'LL NEVER CATCH UP. WE HAVE TO. I DON'T HAVE TIME, IARA. I DON'T WANT TO SLOW YOU DOWN. I JUST WANT TO SAY SORRY. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS LATER. I KNOW I SHOULDN'T  HAVE DONE WHAT I DID. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT,  OR WHY I'M DOING THIS. I'VE A FEELING  IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP. IF YOU WANT TO HELP,  THINK LESS ABOUT YOURSELF, MORE ABOUT THE CREATURES  YOU SUPPOSEDLY CARE FOR. DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND  HOW I FELT? I COME FROM THIS WORLD  OF COLD BLOOD, DARKNESS. YOU -- YOU'RE WARMTH AND LIGHT. HOW COULD I NOT BE ATTRACTED? I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY. I TOOK THIS WORLD AND NOW IT  DEMANDS TOO MUCH OF ME. I ONLY WANTED  TO SHARE YOUR GIFT. YOU MAKE ME A PROMISE. IF YOU EVER GET  YOUR POWERS BACK, YOU'LL NEVER USE THEM  AGAINST YOUR CREATURES AGAIN. CAN I PROMISE TO TRY? ACH...PFF. THE NORDS MUST BE ABLE  TO SMELL THE IVORY BY NOW. DAR WILL GET THERE IN TIME. HE HAS TO. I DON'T REMEMBER  INVITING YOU HERE. MY WORLD IS AT STAKE TOO. THERE'S NOTHING ANY OF US CAN DO NOW ANYWAY. NO...OUR MAGIC  CAN'T BE RELIED UPON. IT NOW ALL DEPENDS ON DAR PASSING THE LAST TEST. AND IF HE DOESN'T? IF HE DOESN'T...  THEN OUR FINAL ACT WILL BE TO WATCH A WORLD OF MADNESS AND DARKNESS  TAKE OUR PLACE. -NORD FOOTPRINTS.  -ARE YOU SURE IT'S HJALMAR? IT'S ALSO THE ROGUE TIGER. HERE? IT'S LIKE  HE'S TRACKING THEM TOO. OR JUST STAYING  CLOSE TO US. OH, WELL, THERE'S  A PLEASANT THOUGHT. OH, THAT'S THE ANSWER. MY THIRD TASK IS TO KEEP  MY PROMISE TO HIM. HE'S STILL HUNGRY, TAO. I HAVEN'T FOUND HIM FOOD YET. TAO...RUN. IF I DIE, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. WHY DO I GO ALONG  WITH THESE THINGS? BECAUSE YOU  TRUST ME. THAT'S ANOTHER  ONE OF MY PROBLEMS. DON'T WORRY, HE WON'T  TAKE US DOWN -STRAIGHT AWAY.  -HOW DO YOU KNOW? 'CAUSE HE'S  A HUNTER. HE'LL TAKE HIS TIME. OH, GOOD. SOMETHING  ELSE TO LOOK OUT FOR. THIS IS IT. WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE  TO CARRY IT ALL. WHAT ARE WE DOING? IF WE GET TOO FAR AHEAD,  HE'LL GIVE UP. THAT MEAN WE CAN STOP RUNNING? NO. OH...I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! MADNESS AND DARKNESS. -OH!  -WHAT IS IT? MY HEAD. NO... I'M STARTING TO FORGET. WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE  ANY LONGER THAN WE HAVE TO. [ TAO ]: THIS IS ASTONISHING. HOW CLOSE IS THE TIGER? I CAN'T SEE IT  ANY MORE. GOOD. GOOD? IT'S HUNTING US, NOT THEM. I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE. I THINK I KEPT  MY PROMISE. THE PROMISE TO THAT TIGER? YOU'RE NOT LETTING  HIM HUNT MEN? YOU SHOULD HAVE KEPT RUNNING. I DON'T RUN. AND THIS IS HIS NEW HOME. NO! YOU LIED ABOUT LOSING YOUR GIFT. I DON'T LIE, EITHER. THEN WHAT'S ALL THIS, THEN? IT'S PROOF I'VE GOTTEN IT BACK. THIS PLACE BELONGS  TO THE ROGUE TIGER. AND IF YOU COME BACK, HE WILL HUNT YOU. AHH, DYING ELEPHANTS... THE NEW HUNTING GROUND --  YOU BROUGHT THE TIGER TO A PLACE WHERE HE CAN FEED. YOU KEPT YOUR PROMISE. I GUESS YOU PASSED. DOES THIS MEAN THE NORDS WON'T BE RETURNING  TO THE ELEPHANT'S GRAVEYARD? I HAVE A FEELING  IT MIGHT. HJALMAR DOES  HAVE SOME HONOUR. HE'LL TELL VODEN THE  IVORY TRADER LIED. -TO SAVE HIS SKIN.  -FROM VODEN BUT HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE  SEEKING SELF-PRESERVATION, I MYSELF WILL BE LEAVING FOR A TIME. NO, DON'T PANIC, MY DEAR. YOU WON'T BE GETTING RID OF THE OLD GROUCH THAT EASILY. IT WAS YOUR INTERFERENCE  THAT CONVINCED ME TO SEARCH FOR STRONGER MAGIC. DON'T CONSIDER THIS  AN OPPORTUNITY, IARA. WHILE I'M AWAY, THERE  WILL BE NO MORE MISCHIEF. NO MORE. YOU HAVE MY WORD. GOOD. THEN...GOODBYE,  MY LITTLE LOVELIES. I THINK THAT'S IT. DAR... YOU'RE SURE IT'S  OK FOR THIS TIGER TO EAT ELEPHANTS  COMING HERE TO DIE? HE SAID HE'LL WAIT  TILL THEY'VE PASSED ON. I GUESS HE NOW  KNOWS THAT YOU WERE HIS FRIEND ALL ALONG. IT'S MORE THAN THAT. NOW HE KNOWS  HIS LIFE CAN GO ON. HE CAN STILL CONTRIBUTE  TO THE BALANCE OF NATURE. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
