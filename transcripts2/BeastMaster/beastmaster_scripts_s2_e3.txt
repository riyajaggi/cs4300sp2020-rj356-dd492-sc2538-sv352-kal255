  DAR, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT-- AH! THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM. YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING  WHILE YOU'RE WALKING. SO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULDN'T BE WALKING AND THINKING  AT THE SAME TIME. SURE, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS MY WHOLE LIFE --  WALKING, THINKING... EATING, THINKING,  RESTING, THINKING. I THINK I'M EVEN THINKING  WHILE I'M SLEEPING. GOOD, GOOD, 'CAUSE THINKING  IS A VERY SERIOUS BUSINESS.

 IF WE DIDN'T THINK,  WHERE WOULD WE BE? WALKING. I CAN'T BELIEVE  YOU JUST SAID THAT. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. SOMEONE'S CLOSE BY. WHO? ANSWER ME, SEER! TWO MEN. BUT THEY MEAN  YOU NO HARM. AND BEHIND US? WHO FOLLOWS? WHO? I-I DON'T KNOW. IT'S A WOMAN. BUT I CAN'T...

 -I CAN'T...  -HAVE A LOOK. AND AFTER YOU'VE  FINISHED WITH HER, KILL HER. AHHH! -TERRONS. THEY HAVE A WOMAN.  -W-WHERE? GO TO THE CAVE. RUH'S THERE. DON'T GET CAUGHT! [ CHUCKLING ] THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU. YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO  WITH HER EITHER. BETTER ME THAN  JUMPING TO HER DEATH. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... [ MOANING ] AH, IT'S THE  BEASTMASTER'S FRIEND. GET HIM! THINK, RUN. RUN, THINK  AND RUN. SAME TIME. THINK ABOUT IT. [ PANTING ] -UGH, THANK YOU. -YOU'RE WELCOME, YOU ALL RIGHT? -I THINK SO.  -WHAT ARE YOU CALLED? OLWEN. THAT'S, THAT'S A NAME  I HAVEN'T HEARD BEFORE. I COME FROM THE MOUNTAINS,  IN THE UPLANDS. IT'S A LONG WAY. I'M DAR. I KNOW. YOU'RE THE BEASTMASTER. HOW DO YOU KNOW ME? I CAN SEE YOUR THOUGHTS. WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  ARE YOU A SORCERESS? NO, UH, SOME PEOPLE  CALL ME A SEER. I DIDN'T SEEK TO BECOME ONE. A CURSE WAS  PLACED ON ME. WHY? I FELL IN LOVE  WITH THE WRONG MAN. AN EVIL MAGICIAN PUNISHED ME,  CURSED ME WITH THE ABILITY TO READ OTHERS' THOUGHTS. LIKE YOUR GIFT WITH ANIMALS. I DON'T THINK MY GIFT'S A CURSE. MAYBE IT ISN'T FOR YOU  BUT FOR ME IT IS, BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE  WANT TO HAVE IT. THEY WANT TO KNOW  WHAT OTHERS ARE THINKING, SO THEY CAN USE IT  TO OUTWIT THEM OR CONTROL THEM OR DEFEAT THEM, AND FOR THAT, THEY NEED AND WANT ME. MY LIFE ISN'T IMPORTANT,  ONLY THE CURSE. HOW DO YOU SEE THOUGHTS? I SEE IMAGES. THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS PRECISE,  BUT THEY GIVE A MEANING. AND I CAN TELL WHAT'S BEING THOUGHT. THAT'S WHY THE TERRONS HAD YOU. YES, THEIR KING SENT  THEM TO FIND ME. AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES. I UNDERSTAND. I KNOW. BUT YOU SHOULD LEAVE ME. I CAN ONLY BRING YOU TROUBLE. YOUR THOUGHTS ARE GOOD. AND THAT'S WHY I RAN  FROM THE TERRONS. I KNEW SOMEONE WAS CLOSE BY  WHO TRIED TO SAVE ME. THE CURSE ISN'T ALL THAT BAD. NO, SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD, BUT I DON'T WANT  TO SEE IT GET YOU KILLED. ALL RIGHT, WE SHOULD BE MOVING. THEY'LL BE LOOKING. ANCIENT ONE? WHAT IN THE WORLD  ARE YOU DOING? NOT THINKING. NOT THINKING. IN TOUCH WITH THE HARMONY  OF THIS UNIVERSE. ALTHOUGH IT'S RATHER DIFFICULT WHEN ONE IS CONSTANTLY  INTERRUPTED. AND THIS IS HOW IT'S DONE. IT'S HOW IT WILL BE DONE,  ON EARTH AS IT IS IN HEAVEN AND OTHER MORE TANTALIZING  LOCATIONS. AND WHAT KIND OF THOUGHTS  ARE YOU NOT HAVING? PLAYFUL SPECULATIONS. THE FUTURE OF MANKIND. THE DUBIOUS NICHE LEFT FOR  GOOD IN THIS JOYLESS WORLD, AND SOME RANDOM SNIPPETS REAGRDING  THE USE OF THE SMILE AS AN AGENT FOR HEALING. WOULD YOU  LIKE TO SEE? YOUR THOUGHTS, ON THOSE MATTERS? MM-HMM. I DON'T THINK SO. NOW, THE ANSWER TO YOUR  NEXT QUESTION IS..."NO", TO THE ONE AFTER IT'S  "NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS", AND TO THE ONE YOU'RE THINKING  ABOUT RIGHT NOW, IF YOU PLAY WITH FIRE...  YOU'LL GET BURNED. JUST TELL ME ABOUT ARINA. WHY IS SHE HERE, AND WHY IS SHE  FOLLOWING DAR? HE HAS SOMETHING SHE WANTS. I WON'T LET HER HAVE HIM. NOT YOUR CHOICE, DEARIE. AND PERHAPS NOT  HE'S NOT HER GOAL. ARGH! [ PANTING ] [ SCREAMING ] SO WHERE DID THE  TERRONS FIND YOU? I WAS CROSSING  A RIVER IN A BOAT. FROM THE UPLANDS  INTO THE TERRITORIES. THEY WERE WAITING  FOR US ON THE SHORE. THEY KILLED THE TWO BOYS WHO WERE HELPING ME. TERRONS WOULD KILL EVERYONE. I WASN'T REALLY SURE  WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL I READ THEIR THOUGHTS. KING ZAD SENT THEM. YEAH, THAT'S HIS NAME. SO WHY DID YOU GO  TO THE TERRITORIES? I WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE. I KNOW OF A PLACE  WHERE I CAN BE SAFE. A WARRIOR WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET ME AND GUARANTEE  MY SAFE PASSAGE. ARGH! [ SCREAMING ] ONE MORE NOISE AND  IT WILL BE YOUR LAST. [ SCREAMING ] YES, I'M ALL RIGHT, AND YES,  WE SHOULD GET AWAY FROM HERE. SURELY YOU MUST HAVE BETTER NEWS TO BRING ME. I COULD TORTURE YOU  AND KILL YOU... BLEED YOU, THEN KILL YOU. CRUSH YOUR FAT HEAD  LIKE A BEETLE ON A ROCK... BUT I'M A MAN OF COMPASSION. AM I NOT? YOU ARE. AND I SHARE THAT COMPASSION  WITH MY MEN. [ CHUCKLING ] I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT  YOUR FAULT... THAT YOU LOST THE WOMAN  I SENT YOU TO FIND. THINGS HAPPEN. NONE OF YOU ARE PERFECT. BUT A FAILURE HAS A PRICE. PAY IT... THEN GET YOUR MISERABLE  FACE OUT OF MY SIGHT. [ SCREAMING ] WHERE ARE  YOU TAKING ME? YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID. I'M NOT  AFRAID OF YOU. I KNOW A CAVE. MY FRIEND TAO WILL BE WAITING  THERE IN THE MORNING WITH RUH. HE'S ANOTHER FRIEND. WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE  A FRIEND WHO'S A TIGER? SOMETIMES I THINK  WE'RE LIKE BROTHERS. OTHER TIMES, I DON'T  UNDERSTAND HIM AT ALL. AND YOU TRUST EACH OTHER? THEN IT'S LIKE A GOOD BROTHER,  IN ANY FAMILY. YOU KNOW, I THINK ANIMALS  MAKE A GOOD FAMILY. WELL, FOR ME, AT LEAST, THEY DO. AND TAO? TAO IS A GOOD FRIEND. HE, HE TEACHES ME THINGS. AND HE MAKES ME LAUGH. HA, BUT HE TALKS TOO MUCH. YEAH. ANYONE ELSE? YOU COULDN'T SAVE HER. THERE WAS NO WAY  YOU COULD DO IT. I LOVED HER VERY MUCH. SAVE THAT. YOU MIGHT WANT IT IN ANOTHER WORLD. YOU BELIEVE THERE  ARE OTHER WORLDS? I READ THOUGHTS. I KNOW THERE ARE. WE'LL LEAVE WHEN THE SUN RISES. IT SMELLS BAD BUT IT WORKS. BY MORNING THIS HAND WILL BE  AS GOOD AS NEW. BETTER. YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN  PROUD OF ME TODAY. I KNOW THAT DAR SENT YOU TO LOOK AFTER ME, BUT I DIDN'T NEED YOU. I MADE PRETTY GOOD WORK  OF A TERRON ON MY OWN. FROM NOW, PEOPLE  WILL HAVE TO REFER TO ME AS "TAO THE MIGHTY". IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT  STRENGTH AND DARING. BEING A WARRIOR REQUIRES  INTELLIGENCE TOO. I'M GOING TO START  THINKING ABOUT IT. WATCH ME. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND A WORD  I'M SAYING, DO YOU? LET'S GO TO SLEEP. I CAN TAKE THE FIRST WATCH. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AFTER ME. YOU BETTER TAKE THE FIRST WATCH YOU'RE SO MUCH BETTER. SORCERESS? SORCERESS? YOU LOOK ANGRY. I WAS, BUT SEEING YOU... LIKE THE TIDE PULLED  BY THE MOON, MY ANGER RECEDES. SO WHAT BRINGS  YOU HERE? A PROPOSAL. AND A FAVOUR, REALLY. ONE WHICH WOULD PLACE ME  IN YOUR DEBT FOREVER. MMM, WHAT  A PLESANT THOUGHT. THE BEASTMASTER'S MANAGED  TO TAKE SOMETHING FROM ME. SOMETHING I WANT AND NEED  VERY MUCH. HOW CAN I HELP? YOU COULD HELP ME FIND HIM. AS YOU KNOW, I HAVE  NO INTEREST IN THIS MAN WHO TALKS WITH BEASTS...  ONLY WHAT HE TOOK. AND IN RETURN...I'M SURE  THERE'S SOMETHING I COULD PROVIDE FOR YOU. THERE IS. THERE'S A WOMAN  IN THE TERRITORIES, A WARRIOR, HER  NAME IS ARINA. YES. I WANT TO KNOW  WHAT SHE'S DOING HERE, AND  WHAT SHE WANTS SURELY YOU COULD FIND  THIS OUT ON YOUR OWN. YES, BUT THE  ANCIENT ONE IS PLAYING A GAME, BLOCKING MY POWERS. WILL YOU HELP ME? ABSOLUTELY. THE BEASTMASTER... [ GRUMBLING ] GOOD MORNING, BEASTMASTER. ONLY I'M NOT SURE HOW GOOD IT'S GOING  TO TURN OUT FOR YOU. DON'T FIGHT ME...OR IT WILL  TRULY BE A TERRIBLE MORNING. TELL ME, BEASTMASTER.  WHERE'S THE WOMAN? THE ONE WHO SEES  INTO PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS. LIKE I'M SEEING INTO YOURS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU'RE A BAD LIAR, BEASTMASTER. ON THE OTHER HAND,  I'M A MAGNIFICENT LIAR. BUT I WANT TO SPEAK  THE TRUTH HERE. SO SPEAK. I HAVE NO DESIRE TO HARM  THIS WOMAN FROM THE UPLANDS. SHE'S MUCH TOO VALUABLE. IN FACT, IF SHE COMES TO ME WITH HER TALENT... TALENTS, I'M MORE LIKELY  TO MAKE HER A QUEEN. MORE LIKELY A SLAVE. YOU MISJUDGE ME. YOU'RE NOT ONLY  A MAGNIFICENT LIAR... YOU'RE A KILLER. YOU MURDER YOUR OWN MEN. A LITTLE MURDER NOW AND  THEN TEACHES THEM TO OBEY. PLACE SOME SUGAR  WITHIN THEIR REACH, THEY'LL DO WHAT YOU WANT. KEEP THE KNIFE CLOSER  IN CASE THEY DON'T. YOU ONLY WANT THE WOMAN  SO YOU CAN USE HER. OF COURSE...TO PROTECT ME. TO LET ME KNOW WHAT  MY ENEMIES ARE THINKING, WHO MAY BE PLANNING TO KILL ME,  HOW AND WHEN. LOOK AROUND. WE LIVE IN A WORLD  OF CHAOS, BEASTMASTER. RANDOM VIOLENCE,  ACTS AGAINST CIVILIZATION. I WISH TO REPAIR THAT. I WANT TO BRING ORDER  INTO OUR WORLD. YOUR ORDER. YES. AND THERE CAN BE NO OTHER. I WON'T TOLERATE IT. I UNDERSTAND YOU. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE  THE WOMAN IS. DO YOU DISLIKE ME  SO MUCH, BEASTMASTER? HUH? DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN PROTECT HER? DO YOU TAKE ME FOR A FOOL? NO...I JUST TAKE YOU  FOR WHAT YOU ARE. TAKE HIM! YOU SHOULD REALLY TEACH  YOUR MEN HOW TO FIGHT. DAR? HELLO. YES, YOUR FRIEND,  THE BEASTMASTER, SAVED ME. UH, I'M NOT SURE,  BUT I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. I WAS WONDERING  WHERE THE TIGER IS. I WAS WONDERING  THE SAME THING MYSELF. HE'S PROBABLY OUT  LOOKING FOR DAR. I'M CALLED TAO. I KNOW. I'M OLWEN. SO, WHAT HAPPENED? ALL I KNOW IS THAT  DAR SAID A WOMAN HE WENT OUT TO HELP  AND TOLD ME TO FIND THIS CAVE. I HAD MY OWN PROBLEM  WITH THE TERRONS. LET YOU WANDER AROUND THE FOREST ALONE -- IT'S FRIGHTENING HERE. HE SAID YOU'D TALK A LOT. BUT YOU DESERVE AN EXPLANATION. IF I COULD JUST  SIT DOWN SOMEWHERE. UH... I'LL TELL YOU THE WHOLE STORY. [ GROWLING ] RIGHT NOW, YOU  CAN READ THE THOUGHTS OF ANYONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD? NOT EXACTLY. THEY HAVE TO BE CLOSE BY. AND I HAVE TO BE  PAYING ATTENTION. OLWEN JUST TOLD ME EVERYTHING ABOUT HER ABILITY TO READ MINDS. NO MATTER WHAT, YOU ALWAYS  SEE THE GOOD IN THINGS. SO WHY DID YOU LEAVE? I SAW THE THOUGHTS  OF THE TERRONS. I THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T MEAN YOU  ANY HARM, BUT THEY WANTED ME. SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE  EASIER IF I WEREN'T THERE. AND YOU READ MY THOUGHTS  AND YOU SAW THIS PLACE. -SO I KNEW WHERE TO COME.  -FANTASTIC. WHO'S THAT WOMAN WHO'S  BEEN FOLLOWING ME? HER NAME'S ARINA. SHE'S A WARRIOR  I KNOW. SHE COMES FROM YOUR HOME  IN THE UPLANDS. ARINA'S HERE? WHY? I DON'T KNOW.  I CAN SEE HER THOUGHTS. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND  THEM -- THEY SEEM STRANGE, UNDEFINED. LIKE THE OTHERS -- TO USE  YOUR TALENT FOR HER OWN ENDS. I'LL GO BACK AND ASK HER. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S  A GOOD IDEA. SHE'S DANGEROUS. RIGHT NOW SHE'S VERY SAFE. -I JUST DON'T TRUST HER.  -TRUST ME. BEASTMASTER,  I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN. I THINK YOU DID. WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? I'M NOT. THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? LOOKING FOR OLWEN. I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR HER. WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU? WHY SHOULDN'T YOU? I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS. AT LEAST WE WERE ONCE. DON'T YOU REMEMBER? I'D LIKE US TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN. JUST LET OLWEN SEE ME. THEN YOU'LL KNOW  I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. OH! MATTEUS IS WAITING FOR YOU. WHEN WE GET  THERE, YOU'LL SEE. I SAW HIM IN YOUR THOUGHTS. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW  YOU WERE THE ONE. MATTEUS IS THE MAN I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT -- THE MAN I'M IN LOVE WITH, AND  ARINA IS THE WARRIOR I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET  BEFORE THE TERRONS TOOK ME. I'LL MAKE SURE SHE REACHES  THE SAFE PLACE. -UNHARMED.  -OLWEN. I THOUGHT YOU SAID YOU  COULDN'T SEE ARINA'S THOUGHTS. YOU COULDN'T  UNDERSTAND THEM. I COULDN'T. NOT UNTIL SHE CAME CLOSER. NOW I'M SO HAPPY SHE DID. -THIS PLACE, IS IT FAR?  -YES. WELL, MAYBE WE  SHOULD COME WITH YOU. I MEAN, BETWEEN YOU, DAR AND I, WE'LL KNOW THAT OLWEN  WILL BE SAFE. NO, MATTEUS  FOUND IT. I KNOW WE CAN LIVE  SAFELY THERE. AND WE PROMISE NO ONE ELSE  WILL KNOW WHERE IT IS WE SHOULD LEAVE.  THE TERRONS MIGHT COME BACK. THANK YOU, BEASTMASTER. MAYBE NOW YOU  AND I CAN BE FRIENDS AGAIN. I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU. TRAVEL SAFELY. I STILL DON'T  TRUST THAT ARINA. NO, BUT OLWEN DOES. SHE SAYS SHE SAW HER THOUGHTS,  EVEN HER LOVER. STILL, I'D FEEL  BETTER IF WE WERE GOING WITH HER. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? ASKING SOME ANIMAL FRIENDS  TO KEEP WATCH. YOUR THOUGHTS SEEM CONFUSED. I KEEP THINKING I HEAR  SOMETHING OR SEE SOMETHING. PEOPLE OR ANIMALS? I'M NOT SURE. I'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER ONCE WE'RE FARTHER AWAY  FROM THE TERRITORIES... AND THE TERRONS. SO WILL I. [ GROANING ] THAT'S A GOOD GIRL. OH, THAT'S VERY GOOD. OWWW! TAKE CARE OR I'LL... SORCERESS! OH, YOU'VE GOT FIRM HANDS. I LIKE THAT IN A WOMAN. AND YOU'RE WEAK...SOFT. FULL OF ACHES AND PAINS. SHOULD I LIKE THAT IN MAN? IT'S ONLY TEMPORARY. WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH YOU? I THOUGHT WE WERE  GOING TO HELP ONE ANOTHER. -I DIDN'T GET WHAT I WANTED.  -YES, I KNOW. THE BEASTMASTER  MADE A FOOL OF YOU. THAT WOMAN HAS ALSO  MADE A FOOL OF HIM. THE SEER? NO, THE WARRIOR, ARINA. ONCE AGAIN, YOU'RE  SEVERAL MOVES BEHIND THE PLAY. I KNOW SHE'S LYING. THE QUESTION IS,  WHAT IS SHE LYING ABOUT? IF YOU TELL ME  WHERE SHE'S GONE-- YOU'LL WHAT? ALLOW YOURSELF  TO BE HUMILIATED AGAIN? NO ONE HUMILIATES ME AND LIVES LONG ENOUGH TO ENJOY THE MOMENT. SO PROUD. SO COMPLETELY DELUDED. NOW, I LIKE THAT IN A MAN. I WANT TO KNOW  WHAT ARINA'S DOING HERE AND WHY SHE'S FOLLOWING DAR. SHE MAY BE MORE DANGER  THAN YOU KNOW. IF SHE'S A DANGER TO ME,  I'LL KILL HER. AS FOR YOU, I THINK YOU'D  BETTER ASK HER YOURSELF. SOFT, WEAK, FULL  OF ACHES AND PAINS, DELUDED AND USELESS. NOW TELL ME,  WHAT IS THERE TO LIKE IN  A MAN LIKE YOU? [ CAWING ] ARINA, I HAVE TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHAT? YOU FOLLOWED DAR AND I. WHY DIDN'T YOU  COME TO US SOONER? I COULDN'T. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOUR THOUGHTS. YOU'VE BEEN MAKING THEM UP. THEY'RE LIES. MEANT TO FOOL ME. FOOLISH CHILD. OF COURSE THEY ARE,  BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER NOW. -YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.  -NO! WHAT'S HAPPENING? JUST WHAT YOU THOUGHT.  IT'S ARINA. ARINA, I ONCE TOLD YOU, YOU'RE PLAYING A DANGEROUS GAME. I HAVE NO REASON TO  QUARREL WITH YOU. CAN YOU DO SOMETHING  ABOUT THIS? THAT SORT OF SOMETHING? THANK YOU. NOW YOU OWE ME. WHY ARE YOU HERE? SIMPLY FOR THE WOMAN. THE SEER, WHY? SHE'S A GREAT VALUE  IN A DANGEROUS WORLD. I CAN HELP HER. SHE CAN HELP ME. THEN WHY DO YOU FOLLOW  THE BEASTMASTER? I DON'T. HE'S OF NO USE TO ME. GOOD. BECAUSE HE IS TO ME. WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU? YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE ME. YOU CAN SEE IT FOR YOURSELF. I TOOK THE WOMAN FROM HIM,  DIDN'T I? IF I WANTED HIM, WHY WOULD I TAKE HER? AND IF YOU CATCH HER? YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN. THAT WOULD BE NICE. NOW YOU BETTER LEAVE  BEFORE I LET THESE TIGERS GO. WHAT'S HAPPENING? SOMETHING'S WRONG. ARINA'S ESCAPED FROM RUH  AND THE OTHER TIGERS. I DO NOT TRUST HER,  I DO NOT TRUST THAT WOMAN. [ DAR'S THOUGHTS ]:  OLWEN, SLOW DOWN. SLOW DOWN. DON'T WORRY. DON'T BE HARD ON YOURSELF. IT  WAS DIFFICULT TO DECEIVE YOU. WHERE I'M TAKING YOU  WON'T BE AS BAD AS THE TERRONS, I PROMISE. AND WHY SHOULD  I BELIEVE YOU? YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. ARINA, LET HER GO. I CAN'T. SHE'S TOO IMPORTANT. IMPORTANT TO WHO? I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU. IT'S YOUR CHOICE. THEN WE HAVE NONE. DAR, HER HAIR, HER HAIR! ENOUGH? YOU WON'T KILL ME. IT'S NOT IN YOUR NATURE. NO? I HAVE A BETTER IDEA. YOU'RE RIGHT. I WON'T KILL YOU, ARINA. I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR RUH. HE'S UNHAPPY ABOUT THE WAY YOU ESCAPED FROM HIM  AND HIS FRIENDS BEFORE. SO YOU'RE SURE YOU DON'T I THINK IT'S BETTER  NO ONE KNOWS WHERE I'M GOING. AND I KNOW YOU AGREE WITH THAT. WELL, IT SEEMS YOU  WERE THE WARRIOR MEANT TO GIVE ME SAFE PASSAGE ALL ALONG. AT LEAST THIS FAR. THEY'LL TAKE YOU THE REST OF THE WAY SAFELY -- AND NO ONE -WILL KNOW WHERE THAT IS.  -THANK YOU. YOU'RE WELCOME. I NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT  YOU MEAN ABOUT YOUR CURSE. AND I WAS WRONG ABOUT YOURS. GOODBYE. OLWEN. HOLD A GOOD THOUGHT. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
