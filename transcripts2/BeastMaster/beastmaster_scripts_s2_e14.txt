  THIS NEW COMBINATION OF  ELEMENTS IS INTERESTING, DAR. I MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING  THIS TIME. I HOPE IT'S WORTH  ALL THE BAGGAGE IT'S MAKING YOU CARRY AROUND. NOTHING WRONG WITH  LEARNING SOMETHING NEW. SO I'VE BEEN STUDYING  HOW AND WHY PEOPLE USE -THE WEAPONS THAT THEY MAKE.  -OH, WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED? WELL, I LEARNED THAT A LARGE WARRIOR PREFERS A SWORD  THAT HE CAN SLASH WITH... WHEREAS A SMALLER ONE PREFERS  ONE THAT HE CAN THRUST WITH, SO HE CAN KILL QUICKLY.  THEN THERE'S ARROW POINTS.

 AND SOME ARROW POINTS  ARE DESIGNED TO BRING DOWN DEER...WHILE OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO KILL A MAN. [ SIGHING ] YOU LEARN A LOT  ABOUT PEOPLE BY WATCHING THE WAY THEY FIGHT. THE WAY YOU TELL A LION'S  FEELINGS BY ITS ROAR. -REALLY?  -YEAH. -WHAT'S THIS ONE DOING?  -IT'S CALLING SOMEONE. TRYING TO GATHER HIS FAMILY  BEFORE THE NIGHTFALL. YOU SEE, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW. NEXT TIME I HEAR THAT ROAR,  I WON'T BE SO FRIGHTENED. OH... I'D RUN IF YOU HEAR THAT ONE,  TAO. HE'S ANGRY.

 SOUNDS LIKE  A FAMILY QUARREL. WHAT DO LIONS HAVE  TO FIGHT ABOUT? YOU SEE, THE STRONGEST MALE  RULES THE PRIDE. THE OTHERS DO WHAT HE SAYS,  BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG  WHO WANTS TO CHANGE THINGS. MUST BE GETTING  VERY ANGRY. NO, NOW HE'S AFRAID. -WHAT ARE LIONS FRIGHTENED OF?  [ SCREAMING ] -THAT WASN'T A LION.  -NO. [ ROARING ] DID YOU THINK YOU COULD ESCAPE? NO, FALE, HE'LL KILL YOU. WITH PLEASURE. BUT IT'S NOT HIM I WANT. YOU BELONG WITH YOUR PEOPLE. NO. AS LONG AS YOU'RE ALIVE... YOU BELONG WITH US. LET HER GO. THIS IS NOT YOUR CONCERN. I SAID... LET HER GO. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT AFTER  YOU'VE LET HER GO. PLEASE DON'T TRY AND FIGHT HIM. YOU CAN'T. I WILL IF I HAVE TO. RUN, GET OUT OF HERE! [ HISSING ] IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... [ GROWLING ] YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO INTERFERE. THIS DOES NOT CONCERN YOU. IF YOU FOLLOW ME, OR THE GIRL, YOU'LL FIND MORE  PAIN THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? DID YOU SEE  WHERE HE ATTACKED ME? HE FIGHTS LIKE A LION. HE COMES IN HARD  AND FAST FOR THE LEGS. I'VE NEVER SEEN A MAN  FIGHT LIKE THAT BEFORE. CAN YOU TRACK  THEM IN THE DARK? I'LL TRY. GO BACK. WAIT  FOR ME AT THE CAMP. AHHH! DID YOU FIND THEM? NO. -HOW DID YOU SLEEP?  -I DIDN'T. I COULDN'T SHAKE THAT FEELING  LIKE I WAS BEING WATCHED. THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU WERE --  SOMETHING OR SOMEONE MOVED OFF AS I CAME BACK. THE SAME MAN FROM LAST NIGHT? WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH. [ ROARING ] RUH? RUH. HE WON'T HURT YOU.  HE'S JUST LOOKING OUT FOR US. YOU HAVE A COMPANION  WHO'S A TIGER. WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS LYCA. THIS IS MY COMPANION, FALE. NAVAS WILL KILL HIM  IF HE FINDS HIM. NAVAS IS THE MAN  WHO ATTACKED YOU? WHAT DOES  HE WANT? TO RETURN ME TO OUR TRIBE, BUT I WON'T GO. WHY NOT? IT IS MY TIME  TO TAKE A HUSBAND. TO WORK FOR HIM  AND BEAR HIS CHILDREN. BUT HE WILL NOT BE A HUSBAND  I CHOOSE FOR MYSELF. AN ARRANGED  MARRIAGE. A PRISON FOR LIFE. THE WOMEN OF OUR TRIBE  KNOW NO FREEDOM. ONLY A LIFE OF SERVICE --  I RAN WAY. NAVAS IS OUR CHIEF AND IT IS  HIS DUTY TO TAKE ME BACK... OR KILL ME IF I WON'T OBEY. WHERE ARE YOU RUNNING TO? PAST THE  GREAT CLIFFS. THEY MARK THE BOUNDARIES  OF OUR LANDS. NAVAS WILL NOT GO BEYOND THEM. WHAT TRIBE ARE YOU FROM? PLEASE, WE CAN'T STAY HERE.  WE MUST KEEP MOVING. HE'LL NEVER GIVE UP  UNTIL HE FINDS ME. HE'S OUT THERE. I CAN FEEL HIM. DO YOU SEE  ANYTHING? NO. PLEASE, YOU MUST HELP ME. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL TAKE YOU  TO THE CLIFFS. WHAT ABOUT MY CRUCIBLE  AND BELLOWS? LEAVE THEM. NO ONE ELSE  WILL NEED THEM. RUH? WATCH OUR BACKS FROM A DISTANCE. KEEP AN EYE ON US. [ GROWLING ] IT'S QUITE A RELATIONSHIP  YOU HAVE THERE. YEAH, HE'S LIKE A SON TO ME. A NEW MALE TOOK OVER HIS PRIDE. THEY KILL THE OLD MALES' CUBS. HE ESCAPED? SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE HE'S  THE ONE WHO SAVED MY LIFE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? MY TRIBE IS NOT MUCH  MORE CIVILIZED THAN HIS. MY PEOPLE DON'T SHOW ME THE KIND OF AFFECTION  THAT FALE GAVE ME. -WHAT DID HE TELL YOU?  -HE SAID WHEN HE GETS BIGGER HE'LL  PROTECT YOU FROM NAVAS. -YOU WON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.  -DO YOU UNDERSTAND HIM? DAR'S THE BEASTMASTER. THERE ISN'T AN ANIMAL  HE CAN'T COMMUNICATE WITH. AND EMPATHY AS I DO OR DO YOU  ACTUALLY KNOW HIS THOUGHTS? I JUST KNOW WHAT HE TELLS ME. -WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?  -THAT WE'LL MAKE SURE LYCA IS SAFE. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR PEOPLE. THAT'S A LIFE I'VE LEFT BEHIND. I'D RATHER TALK  ABOUT MY FUTURE. A LIFE OF MY OWN CHOOSING,  WITH A MATE WHO LOVES ME AS MUCH AS I LOVE HIM. SHOULDN'T BE MUCH TO ASK FOR. IN MY TRIBE, IT WOULD NEVER  HAVE BEEN ALLOWED. [ GROWLING ] HE'S NEARBY. I CAN FEEL IT. NO, NO, NO, THAT CAN'T BE.  DAR WOULD KNOW. -THE BIRDS WOULD HAVE TOLD US.  -NO. SHE'S RIGHT. WHY DOESN'T  NAVAS ATTACK? THIS MAN MOVES LIKE A LION, TAO. ALMOST ACTS LIKE ONE. A LION WILL STALK  HIS PREY FOR DAYS, WAITING FOR  ONE UNGUARDED MOMENT. WHAT ABOUT SHARAK? EVEN SHARAK WON'T SEE HIM  UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S WHEN WE'RE NOT READY  FOR HIM, HE'LL STRIKE. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE'S STILL  FOLLOWING US. WE NEED  TO BE ALERT. OH, COME ON, DAR, DON'T TELL ME  YOU HAVENT'T NOTICED HER. SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. ANYONE CAN SEE THAT. THAT LION'S CLOSE TO HER  AS RUH'S TO YOU. -TAO.  -YOU HAVE THINGS IN COMMON. SHE LIKES YOU. I CAN SEE THAT. -IT'S NATURAL SHE'S GRATEFUL.  -SHE DOESN'T LOOK AT ME WITH THE SAME GRATITUDE. OH, DAR, COME ON. SHE'S YOUNG, SHE'S SINGLE,  AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO VISIT  THE IN-LAWS, 'CAUSE SHE CAN'T STAND  THEM EITHER. SEE? SEE? HUH? IT'S THE LAST THING  SHE NEEDS NOW. [ SQUAWKING ] -WE SHOULD GET MOVING.  -NAVAS? NO, WARRIORS. ONES  I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE. LYCA. COME ON, THEY'LL BE ON US SOON. LOOK AT THIS. AH, KEEP 'EM, TAKE THEM ALL. THIS WAY. UP AHEAD. AH, NO, IT'S THIS WAY. KEEP MOVING. MOVE IT. COME ON. THERE THEY ARE! FASTER. [ SCREAMING ] WELL, WELL, WELL. WHAT A SURPRISE. CUT HIM OFF FROM THERE. I GOT HIM. WE MEET AGAIN, BEASTMASTER. DON'T TELL ME I FINALLY FOUND  A WOMAN WHO'D RUN FROM YOU. OH, HO, HO, HO. YOU EITHER COME PEACEFULLY, OR I'LL CARVE UP  YOUR PRETTY LITTLE FRIEND. AND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THAT  WOULD BREAK MY HEART. WHAT DO YOU WANT, ZAD? A LITTLE SMALL TALK  MIGHT BE NICE. HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?  LONG TIME NO SEE. YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT. YOU'LL NEVER CHANGE. HA, FLATTERER. BUT I HAVE CHANGED. I'VE GOT REAL WARRIORS WITH ME NOW. MEN WITH FIRE IN THE  BELLIES, AND THERE ARE A LOT MORE TO COME. THEY ARE WHAT'S LEFT  OVER FROM THE TRIBES VODEN SHATTERED --  THE SURVIVORS. AND IN A FEW MONTHS  FROM NOW, THEY'LL RIP THAT LITTLE BOY'S  WORLD TO PIECES. WE DON'T WANT YOUR WAR;  WE'RE USELESS TO YOU. ON THE CONTRARY, I COULD  FIND A HUNDRED USES FOR HER. BUT AT THE MOMENT...  I'M MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN HIM -- ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE A BRIGHT LAD, TAO. I JUST NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D COME IN SO HANDY. I NEED WEAPONS. I NEED SOMEONE TO MAKE  THOSE WEAPONS. SO, YOU SEE, YOU'RE A VERY VALUABLE PRIZE, INDEED. MMM.  [ LAUGHING ] FIND THEM AND BRING THEM! [ ROARING ] LYCA! DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME!  ZAD NEEDS ME! JUST GO AFTER HER! WHO WAS THAT? WHO WAS THAT  THAT HELPED THEM TO GET AWAY? GET HIM BACK TO THE CAMP  BEFORE YOU LOSE HIM, TOO. [ SNARLING ] IF WE'VE LOST HIM, IT WILL  ONLY BE FOR A MOMENT. HE'LL NEVER FIND  YOU IN HERE. EVEN IF NAVAS CAN SEE  IN THE DARK, HE'LL HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING  HIS WAY THROUGH THESE CAVES. ALL RIGHT, YOU'LL  BE SAFE IN HERE. TRY AND GET SOME REST, WHILE  I LOOK FOR TAO AND FALE. WILL ZAD HARM YOUR FRIEND? OH, NO... NOT WHILE HE NEEDS TAO  TO MAKE WEAPONS FOR HIM. AND CAN HE  MAKE THEM? I HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF THERE BEFORE ANYONE FINDS  OUT FOR SURE. WHAT ABOUT FALE? ZAD HAS NO REASON TO HARM FALE. NEITHER DOES NAVAS. BUT SOME MEN THRIVE ON CRUELTY. TELL ME ABOUT NAVAS. I KNOW HE'S NOT JUST A MAN. LYCA, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I'M REALLY UP AGAINST HERE. [ SIGHING ] I CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS YOU TELL ME EVERYTHING. MY TRIBE ARE THE LION PEOPLE. -LION PEOPLE?  -THEY SAY WE CAME INTO BEING WHEN A LION MATED WITH A MAN. THEREFORE, OUR MEN HAVE THE SKILLS AND  THE STRENGTH OF THE LION. AND THE WOMEN  ARE LIKE THE LIONESS -- BORN ONLY TO FIND FOOD  AND BEAR CHILDREN. WE LIVE AS A PRIDE. ONE DOMINATES... AND THE REST  DOES HIS BIDDING. AND THAT'S NAVAS. AND THE ONE WHO  WILL DETERMINE MY FATE... UNLESS I ESCAPE HIM. AND PERHAPS FIND A MATE  OF MY OWN CHOOSING. DO THE WOMEN IN YOUR TRIBE  HAVE THE SAME LION QUALITIES AS THE MEN? NO, WE'RE DIFFERENT. [ ROARING ] [ ZAD ]: ...I CAN SEE THAT. WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, BLIND? EASY...  COME, COME. OURS IS A FORTUITOUS  ENCOUNTER, TAO. YOU CAN BE PART OF HISTORY. MY ARMY WILL SOON RID THE WORLD  OF VODEN AND HIS NORDS. AND YOU WILL BE OUR DELIVERANCE. ONCE AGAIN,  LOGIC HAS MADE THE FOOL OF  YOUR AMBITION. THERE AREN'T HERE THREE  MEN FROM THE SAME TRIBE. ONE THAT HAS TASTED DEFEAT  AND HUMILIATION. ONE THAT KNOWS ONLY TOTAL  VICTORY OR CERTAIN DEATH -FROM OUR MOUTHS.  -NOBLE PLATITUDES. THANK YOU. BUT EMPTY ONES. VODEN'S TOO POWERFUL. JUST GIVE ME WEAPONS  LIKE THEIRS... AND THE BELLY FIRE  WILL DO THE REST. EVERY MAN HERE HAS MASSACRED TRIBESMEN  TO AVENGE. I'M SURE VODEN ISN'T LOSING  ANY SLEEP OVER IT. HE WILL BE, AND PERHAPS  THE BEASTMASTER WILL COME BACK FOR THIS... I CAN ENLIST HIM TO OUR CAUSE. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE CRAZY. DEATH TO THE NORDS! DEATH TO THE NORDS! YES, YES, I'M CRAZY,  CRAZY, CRAZY. CRAZY ENOUGH TO PULL THIS OFF. DEATH TO THE NORDS! DEATH TO THE NORDS! I'LL RETURN AS SOON  AS I FIND TAO AND FALE. WE CAN STILL REACH THE GREAT  CLIFFS BEFORE NIGHTFALL. WHAT IF YOU  DON'T COME BACK? I WILL COME BACK. I PROMISE YOU. THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. I'LL GET YOU TO WHERE  YOU HAVE TO GO. THANK YOU. I HAVE TO GO. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU  TO MAKE ME A SWORD? IT'S NOT AN EXACT SCIENCE. CAN YOU MAKE ONE OR NOT? HOW 'BOUT I MAKE YOU A DEAL? I'LL MAKE YOU A WEAPON, YOU GIVE THE LION  AND I FREEDOM. I'LL GIVE YOU  A BETTER OFFER. MAKE THE SWORD  OR I'LL KILL YOU BOTH. -HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?  -A WHILE. -WHY?  -IT'S A COMPLICATED PROCESS. FIRST, YOUR ORE... YOUR ROCKS. ARE THEY OLD OR NEW? HOW SHOULD I KNOW?  THEY'RE ROCKS. IF YOU DON'T GET THE RIGHT  ROCKS, WE CAN'T MAKE METAL. DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN. ABOUT RUNNING AWAY,  OR THE LION DIES. PSST. HOW'S FALE? FINE. -SHE'S SAFE.  -DON'T LEAVE HER -- WON'T TAKE -LONG FOR NAVAS TO TRACK HER.  -I'M NOT LEAVING YOU. YOU HAVE TO. [ WHISTLING ] ZAD WILL KILL FALE IF I LEAVE. HE HAS HIM HEAVILY GUARDED. WE CAN'T LEAVE HERE  WITHOUT EVERY MAN IN THIS CAMP TRACKING US DOWN. -GET HER ACROSS THE CLIFFS?  -ALL I MUST DO IS TO KEEP STALLING ZAD --  HE WON'T HARM FALE OR ME IF HE THINKS I'M STILL TRYING TO HELP HIM. I'LL SEND RUH TO PROTECT YOU. JUST GET BACK TO HER, DAR. SHE'S THE ONE IN REAL DANGER. AH...YES. HERE YOU ARE. EXCELLENT. ABOUT TIME. YOU NEED TO GO AND TELL ZAD  ABOUT THESE ROCKS. THEY'RE USELESS. I CAN'T WORK... [ CAWING ] [ GROWLING ] [ SNIFFING ] YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING,LYCA. YOU HAVE A DUTY TO YOUR PEOPLE. I OWE YOU NOTHING. WHY DO YOU REJECT US? YOU KNOW WHAT MUST BE. YOU CAN'T ESCAPE. -I WILL ESCAPE.  -TO WHAT? THE OUTSIDE WORLD  IS A DANGEROUS PLACE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND  HOW MUCH YOU COULD BE HURT. WHY CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND? I WANT TO BE FREE. THE PROTECTION OF THE TRIBE  IS ALL THE FREEDOM YOU NEED. NO, I WILL CHOOSE -AND I WILL CHOOSE  MY OWN HUSBAND.  -WHO? THE HUMAN? YOU'RE NOT ONE OF THEM. YOU ARE COMING OF AGE, LYCA. WHAT IS IN YOUR BLOOD IS BEYOND  YOUR CONTROL. GET AWAY FROM ME. I WANT MY OWN LIFE. YOUR LIFE IS WITH US. IT'S WHAT NATURE AND FATE DEMAND. -THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.  -NO. I WILL NOT BE SOMEONE ELSE'S POSSESSION. YOU WILL RETURN WITH ME!  YOU HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE! ACCEPT THE PATH LIFE  HAS CHOSEN FOR YOU. -ONE LAST CHANCE.  -NO! -ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?  -YES. LET'S GET OUT  OF HERE. -HAMMER?  -HAMMER. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM? THERE'S TOO MUCH GREY.  WE NEED MORE RED. MORE RED? PRECISELY. MORE RED. GET HIM ROCKS WITH MORE RED. MORE RED ROCKS...  PINK ROCKS, GREEN ROCKS. I ASKED HIM TO WATCH  OVER TAO UNTIL I GET BACK. CAN'T YOU SEND  HIM AFTER NAVAS? NO...NAVAS WILL  HAVE TO BE OUR PROBLEM. HOW CAN I EVER  THANK YOU? JUST TO SEE YOU GET AWAY  SAFE WOULD MAKE ME HAPPY. WHAT ABOUT FALE? WE'LL BRING HIM TO YOU,  ONCE YOU'VE PAST THE CLIFFS. WE SHOULD KEEP MOVING. STILL A LONG WAY TO GO. HOW MUCH LONGER UNTIL  YOU MAKE ME MY WEAPONS? SOON. THE FIRE  NEEDS TO BE MUCH HOTTER. WE, WE CAN'T USE THIS. WE NEED HARD WOOD. HARD WOOD? HARDER THE BETTER. ARE YOU SURE YOU KNOW  WHAT YOU'RE DOING? IF YOU WANT THIS DONE RIGHT, YOU'RE...YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GATHER SOME HARDER WOOD;  OTHERWISE, I CAN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE  FOR WHAT HAPPENS HERE. GET THIS GRUB SOME HARD WOOD.  [ GRUMBLING ] IF I DON'T HAVE  MY SWORD BY NIGHTFALL, I'LL USE YOU FOR HARD WOOD. DON'T WORRY. FIRST, THE HOT FIRE... THEN I'LL COOK US UP  SOME WEAPONS. WE MUST BE GETTING CLOSE. THE ONLY WAY PAST THE CLIFFS  IS TO CROSS A TREE BRIDGE. -IT SHOULDN'T BE MUCH FURTHER.  -AND THEN? AND THEN YOU'LL BE FREE. WHAT ABOUT YOU? LYCA, ARE YOU SURE  YOU WANT TO DO THIS? YOU KNOW, ONCE YOU CROSS  THE BRIDGE, THERE MAY BE NO TURNING BACK. MY PEOPLE LIVE BY A PRIMITIVE  CODE I CAN'T EMBRACE. MUCH OF THE WORLD'S LIKE THAT. YOU MIGHT FIND THAT WHERE YOU'RE GOING IS NOT  THAT MUCH BETTER. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. NOT SINCE I'VE MET YOU. YOU DON'T FORCE THOSE CLOSE  TO YOU INTO SUBMISSION. YOU DON'T PUT YOUR  OWN LIFE ABOVE OTHERS. YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG I'VE DREAMT OF MEETING  A MAN LIKE YOU. A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS BOTH ANIMAL AND HUMAN FEELINGS. LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS  ONCE WE CROSS THE BRIDGE. WELL? SO FAR, SO GOOD. I'LL BE THE JUDGE OF HOW GOOD IT IS! AHH! ARGH! AHH! I'M GLAD IT'S  STILL IN ONE PIECE. AHH! AH, HA, HA... WHOA! AH, HA, HA... GIVE ME SOMETHING HARD. [ CHEERING ] WHATEVER YOU  DID, IT WORKED. GOOD, THEN I KEPT MY SIDE  OF THE BARGAIN. SO I'LL TAKE FALE  AND DAR'S STAFF-- YOU'LL GO WHEN I HAVE A BLADE FOR EVERY MAN  WHO'LL STAND WITH ME AGAINST VODEN --  VICTORY IS NEAR. DEATH TO THE NORDS! DEATH TO THE NORDS! BREAK OPEN THE WINE!  VODEN IS FINISHED! [ CHEERING ] I CAN SMELL IT. WE HAVE SWORDS! VICTORY IS NEAR! THE BRIDGE IS JUST  BEYOND THOSE TREES. DO YOU KNOW  WHAT YOU'LL DO? WHERE YOU'LL GO? PART OF ME DOESN'T  BELIEVE I'VE ACTUALLY MADE IT THIS FAR. I'M SURE YOU'LL BE  ALL RIGHT ON YOUR OWN. YEAH, I'LL HAVE FALE. AND MAYBE IN TIME... SOMEONE WILL COME ALONG. OR PERHAPS HE ALREADY HAS. OH...NO. -WHY NOT?  -'CAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT. I'M HERE TO HELP YOU --  THAT'S ALL. DAR, YOU'RE EVERYTHING  I'VE EVER WANTED. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU -- I CAN'T. I'M SORRY. NO! [ GROWLING AND SNARLING ] LYCA? LYCA?  [ SNARLING ] LYCA. GET AWAY FROM ME. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO US. OF MY TRIBE BECOME  WHEN WE FEEL PASSION OR ANGER. IT'S ALL RIGHT. [ ROARING AND SNARLING ] I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.  YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME. I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE THIS -- I CAN'T -BE LIKE THEM!  -SHH, SHH. LISTEN TO ME. I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE. TO BE AFRAID OF -- LYCA,  BELIEVE ME WHEN I TELL YOU, YOU CAN STILL HAVE  WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE. [ SNARLING ] I TOLD YOU THERE WAS NO ESCAPE. YOU SEE? THIS IS WHAT OUR WOMEN BECOME. SHE NEEDS TO BE AMONG THOSE WHO ARE LIKE HER. [ DRUNKEN SOLDIER ]:  HAVE SOME MORE. [ LAUGHING ] COME ON, WOMAN.  THIS WAY TO MY... AHH...SLOB. THAT WINE REALLY GOT TO MY HEAD. AHH! HA, HA... -HEY...COME OVER HERE.  -TO VICTORY. VICTORY. AHH! TASTES LIKE DOG VOMIT. GOING SOMEWHERE? NO, I, UH, IT WAS FALLING OVER. THOUGHT I'D  TAKE CARE OF IT. PERHAPS WE SHOULD  DISCOVER HOW WELL YOUR WEAPON CUTS. DON'T, I MUST MAKE MORE WEAPONS. WE WATCHED YOU. DIDN'T SEEM THAT  DIFFICULT, DID IT? [ LAUGHING ] [ GROWLING ] [ ROARING ] KILL IT...KILL IT. WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING FOR -- KILL IT FOR ME. [ STAMMERING ] SHE CANNOT BELONG TO ANYONE  WHO IS NOT OF OUR TRIBE. SHE DOESN'T WANT  YOUR WAYS, NAVAS. -SHE HAS NO CHOICE.  -EVERY CREATURE HAS A RIGHT TO CHOOSE HOW IT LIVES. I KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT FOR HER. SHE'S SAFE WITHIN THE TRIBE. THE WORLD WILL NOT BE SO KIND. THAT'S FOR HER TO DECIDE. LYCA... IF YOU CROSS THAT BRIDGE, YOU WILL BE FREE OF HIM. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. LYCA, GO. DAR... AHH! I WARNED YOU NOT TO INTERFERE. IF YOU TRY TO PASS,  I'LL KILL YOU BOTH. HEY! IS HER FREEDOM  REALLY WORTH YOUR LIFE? YOU SHOULD HAVE LEFT  WELL ENOUGH ALONE. DAR! STAY WHERE YOU ARE.  YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. DAR! IT'S OVER, NAVAS. LET HER GO. LYCA! I WILL BE FREE. THERE'LL ALWAYS BE A PLACE  FOR YOU WITHIN THE TRIBE. YOU WOULDN'T MIND IF I CHOOSE  TO LEAVE NOW, WOULD YOU? I THINK IT'S WHAT YOU  REALLY WANTED ALL ALONG. HE SAYS THANK YOU...
