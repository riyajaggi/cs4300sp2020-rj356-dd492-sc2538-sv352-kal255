 HE'S ONLY A CUB.  JUST A BABY. FOR ONCE, REON,  YOU MAY BE RIGHT. YEAH, WE'LL  KILL HIM NEXT YEAR... WHEN HE'S BIGGER. THIS YEAR...  IT'S HIS MOTHER'S TURN. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... [ STRAINING ] AHH! AHH! TAO, WILL YOU JUST... WILL THE PURPLE HERBS TAKE AWAY  THE PAIN IN YOUR BACK? AS QUICKLY AS THE SUN TAKES-- OW!...THE NIGHT. SO, WHERE DO YOU FIND THEM? IN THE FOREST. THEY PREFER THE SHADE,  LIKE THE BEST FERNS. I'M GOING TO FIND SOME FOR YOU. NO, NO, NO...IT'S, IT'S-- I'LL FIND THEM.  I JUST... NEED A MOMENT. TAO, YOU'RE IN PAIN. IT'S BEGINNING TO DRIVE-- IT'S NOTHING,  IT'S NOTHING. AND BESIDES,  WHAT'S A LITTLE...PAIN! YOU NEVER SEEM  TO SUFFER ANY PAIN. WHY IS THAT?  I DO, I JUST TRY NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT. IF I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,  IT WON'T HURT? MAYBE. [ STRAINING AND STRUGGLING ] OH, I THINK, THEREFORE I HURT. WHAT IS IT? I'M NOT SURE. IS HE HURT? NO, HE'S JUST EXHAUSTED. WHAT'S HE SAYING? HE WANTS TO KNOW  IF I'M THE BEASTMASTER THAT HIS MOTHER TOLD HIM ABOUT. HA, HA, HIS MOTHER...CUTE. SHE ISN'T AROUND HERE,  BY ANY CHANCE, IS SHE? NO, SHE'S BEEN CAPTURED  AND PUT IN A CAGE. YOU KNOW, I WISH ANIMALS COULD  PUT PEOPLE IN CAGES, THEN MAYBE THEY'D KNOW  HOW IT FEELS! I DON'T SUPPOSE HE HAS A NAME? IT'S ARJUNA. AND WHAT A HANDSOME,  LITTLE PRINCE HE IS, TOO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GOING TO DO  WHAT HE ASKED ME TO DO. GO FIND HIS MOTHER  AND SET HER FREE. GO FIND THE PURPLE HERBS,  AND GET RUH. HE'LL KNOW HOW TO FIND US. WE MAY NEED  YOUR HELP. YEAH, YEAH, FINE, FINE. SEE YOU, LITTLE FELLOW. WHICH WAY? UP THERE? SSSS... AHH! AHH! THINK "NO PAIN,"  THINK "NO PAIN." THINK "NO PAIN"...OHH. OH, HO, HO... THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU NEED. LOOK AGAIN. WOW. THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED. THANK YOU, UM... WH-WHERE DID YOU... I MEAN, I DIDN'T  HEAR YOU ARRIVE-- YOU WERE BUSY. I'M CALLED LAYLA. -I'M TAO.  -I KNOW. YOU SEEK THE WAY. I'VE HEARD OF YOU... AND YOUR FRIEND,  THE BEASTMASTER. UH, HE'S HELPING A YOUNG LION GET HIS MOTHER BACK...SOMEWHERE. AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU. TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT. AH, HA, UM.... IT'LL ONLY TAKE A SHORT WHILE. AND THEN ALL YOUR PAIN  WILL HAVE GONE. WELL, IF YOU SAY SO...I MEAN,  EVERYTHING'S WORTH A TRY. AHH! SOMETIMES, PAIN  IS ONLY A STATE OF MIND. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO  IS THINK OF ANOTHER ONE. HEY! LEAVE THE CUB ALONE! THERE ARE ENOUGH  ANIMALS TO KILL. THE CUB SHOULD GO FREE. YOU COULD HURT YOURSELF  IF WE CONTINUE. LEAVE THE CUB ALONE,  AND I WON'T HURT YOU. OK, THAT SOUNDS FAIR. HOW DO I KNOW  YOU ARE TRUSTWORTHY? YOU HAVE MY WORD. WHAT DO YOU THINK, ARJUNA, HUH? IS IT GOOD ENOUGH?  [ GROWLING ] WE HAVE A PROBLEM --  ARJUNA SAYS YOU WERE WITH THOSE WHO CAPTURED HIS  MOTHER AND TRIED TO HURT HIM. I-I TRIED TO STOP THEM. YOU CAN TALK TO HIM? WHEN HE FEELS LIKE IT, YEAH. YOU'RE THE BEASTMASTER. IN THE TERRITORY -- THEY  WERE AFRAID YOU'D STOP THEM. -THEY'RE LOOKING FOR YOU.  -WHO? THE ONES WHO CAPTURED  THE ANIMALS. THAT'S GOOD -- 'CAUSE  I'M LOOKING FOR THEM, TOO. I'M DAR. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? WHY'D THEY CAPTURE  THE ANIMALS, REON? THEY'RE GOING TO SACRIFICE THEM? -WHEN?  -THIS AFTERNOON. Y-YOU CAN'T GO LIKE THAT.  THEY'LL RECOGNIZE YOU. WHAT IS THIS PLACE? IT USED TO BE A PLACE OF  CEREMONY FOR MY PEOPLE, NOW IT'S A PLACE OF RITUAL  AND FALSE WORSHIP. ARKON -- CALLS HIMSELF A LORD,  BUT HE'S ONLY A MAN. HE'S TRICKED MY PEOPLE  INTO BELIEVING THEY SEE HIM AS SOME  KIND OF...SAVIOUR AND PROTECTOR. AND YOU DON'T? HE'S A LIAR, A THIEF AND AN EVIL MAN. HE TAKES ALL THE BEST  GIRLS FOR HIMSELF. YOUR GIRL? HE WILL. -DO THEY FIGHT FOR HIM?  -THEY COMPETE AT THE FESTIVAL HERE --  THE BEST JOIN ARKON'S GUARDS --  A WARRIOR WHO WINS THE COMPETITION, SACRIFICES THEM  TO ARKON'S GREATER GLORY. THERE'S AN EMPTY CAGE. IT'LL BE  FILLED SOON. YOU THINK IT'S BIG  ENOUGH FOR ARKON? AHH! YOUR BACK IS BETTER. BETTER? I HAVEN'T FELT THIS GOOD EVER. THERE ARE OTHER THINGS  I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU. UH... I WOULD LOVE TO... BUT I NEED TO GO. BUT WE NEED AND WHAT WE WANT, AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME THING... ARE THEY? TIGER. ARE YOU BRAVE? COME, TIGER, COME FIGHT KALEX. THE BEAST HAS SPIRIT. ARKON WILL BE PLEASED. WE NEVER USED TO CONDUCT  ANIMAL SACRIFICES. ARKON DEMANDS IT, HUH? HE SAID IT GIVES  OUR MEN STRENGTH, BUT IT DEMEANS US ALL. ARJUNA, NO! ARJUNA, ARJUNA. HE SAYS HIS MOTHER  DOESN'T RECOGNIZE HIM. HEY! REON, WHO'S  YOUR FRIEND? HE'S JUST A FRIEND.  I'M SHOWING HIM THE ANIMALS. I CAN'T TALK TO THEM. ARKON DRUGS THEM. WHAT DOES HE DO TO THE PEOPLE? HE DOES SOMETHING. TRICKERY TO DECEIVE THEM. SOMEHOW, HE MAKES THE PEOPLE  WANT TO BELIEVE IN HIM. AND YOU DON'T. I DID, ONCE. I'LL DO WHAT I CAN,  BUT YOU'LL NEED MORE THAN MY HELP TO FREE THEM. WELL, FIRST,  WE HAVE TO STOP ARKON. -WE BETTER GET OUT OF HERE.  -NO, WAIT. THAT'S RUH. HE'S A FRIEND. HE CAN'T TALK TO ME EITHER. WHERE'S TAO? HOW DID YOU SUDDENLY  APPEAR LIKE THAT? I'M DREAMING -- IF I'M DREAMING,  I'M NOT COMPLAINING, BUT... WHA... WHAT'S THIS PLACE? WE WERE IN THE FOREST  JUST A SECOND AGO, AND I DIDN'T NOTICE  IT CHANGING AND... THIS, THIS MUST BE A DREAM. OR WITCHCRAFT. YOU THINK  I'M A WITCH? IS THIS REAL  ENOUGH FOR YOU? YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL. TAO SHOULD BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE. TAO? HE WOULD HAVE STOPPED KALEX  AND THE OTHERS, WOULDN'T HE? [ LAUGHING ] HE WOULD  HAVE TRIED. REON! PADMA! HEY. THESE ARE MY FRIENDS. DAR AND ARJUNA. DAR, THIS IS PADMA. DAR'S THE BEASTMASTER. HE'S GOING TO SAVE THE ANIMALS. REON, NO! NO, REON. YOU'RE ALREADY IN TROUBLE. YOU SHOW DISRESPECT  FOR OUR LORD ARKON. AND THAT CANNOT BE ALLOWED. ARKON'S A FRAUD. HE BROUGHT THE RAIN  AFTER THE LONG DROUGHT. WITHOUT HIM WE WOULD HAVE DIED. WE PAID FOR HIS HELP. WE'RE STILL PAYING FOR IT. THIS YEAR, YOU'LL BE  PART OF THE PRICE. YOU DON'T KNOW  THAT I'LL BE CHOSEN. WELL, IN THAT CASE,  IT WOULD BE AN HONOUR. AN HONOUR TO LEAVE ME? -IT'S ONLY FOR A YEAR.  -A YEAR? NONE OF THE CHOSEN  HAVE EVER COME BACK. WE'D NEVER SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN.  DON'T YOU CARE? DON'T CAUSE ANY MORE TROUBLE, REON...PLEASE. TERRIBLE THINGS WILL HAPPEN. A MAGNIFICENT OFFERING. KHADRO, THE HIGH PRIEST. ANOTHER BOUNTIFUL HARVEST. AND NOW, WE MUST GIVE  THANKS TO OUR SAVIOUR... OUR PROTECTOR... THE GREAT LORD ARKON! ARKON GIVES YOU NIGHT! ARKON GIVES YOU DAY! ARKON...ACCEPTS YOUR GIFTS. ARKON WILL NOW CHOOSE, FROM AMONGST OUR YOUNGEST  AND FAIREST OF WOMEN, THOSE WHO WILL  BE HIS PRIESTESSES FOR THE YEAR TO COME. WHAT AN HONOUR AWAITS  THREE OF THESE YOUNG WOMEN. BEHOLD... OUR NEW PRIESTESSES. LET US ALL REJOICE IN THEIR GOOD FORTUNE, AND IN THE HONOUR  WHICH ARKON HAS BESTOWED ON THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS PLACE WE'RE GOING,  IS IT MUCH FURTHER? WE'RE ALMOST THERE. ALL I SEE IS SAND. LOOK AGAIN. I KNOW THIS PLACE. THIS IS THE SANCTUARY. THIS IS DAR'S SANCTUARY. YOU WILL FEEL NO PAIN... ONLY PLEASURES. NO CARES OR WORRIES... ONLY DELIGHTS. IT'S ALL HERE FOR YOU, TAO: FOOD, DRINK...ANYTHING  YOUR HEART DESIRES. TRUST YOUR FEELINGS, TAO. TRUST ME. [ INTONING ] YOU ARE NOW IN ARKON'S SERVICE. A NEW LIFE AWAITS YOU,  SUCH AS YOU HAVE NEVER KNOWN. IT IS AN HONOUR, MY LORD. YOU MAY, OF COURSE, BID  FAREWELL TO YOUR FAMILIES. IT IS AN HONOUR, MY LORD. REON. STAY AWAY  FROM ME, KALEX. SHE BELONGS TO ARKON NOW. NOT WHILE I LIVE. GUARDS! GO! GET OUT!  SAVE YOURSELVES! -GUARDS.  -HE'S A FRAUD; HE'S EVIL! CAN'T ANYONE SEE? SEIZE HIM. WE ALL SAW HIM, REON. WE KNOW YOU WERE WITH HIM, REON. ONLY ONE MAN HAS  THAT KIND OF STRENGTH. IT WAS THE BEASTMASTER,  WASN'T IT? YES, AND HE'LL BE BACK. AND YOU, ARKON -- BEFORE THE  SUN SETS, THEY'LL SEE YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE! ANY MORE OF THESE? I'M SEEING THINGS. [ LAUGHING ] [ LAUGHING ] WHAT IS IT, TAO? TAO? IT'S AN ILLUSION. DON'T DO THIS, TAO. LAUGHING BREAKS THE SPELL. YOU'RE TRYING TO  PUT ME IN A TRANCE. [ LAUGHING ] YOU DID. YOU DID PUT ME IN A TRANCE. BRILLIANT! LOOK AT ME, TAO. LOOK AT ME! YOU'RE MAKING  A MISTAKE. I'M UNMAKING ONE. THERE WAS NO SNAKE. I WAS ALMOST KILLED  BY AN ILLUSION. RUH? RUH! SURELY, WHAT  I'VE SHOWN YOU IS PREFERABLE TO THIS. I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST  PLEASURE, LAYLA, BUT WHAT YOU OFFER  COSTS TOO MUCH: FREE WILL, SELF-RESPECT,  LOYALTY TO OTHERS. TO DAR? HE DOESN'T NEED YOU. YOU WILL  REGRET THIS. I CAN LIVE WITH THAT. STRENGTH... COURAGE...FEROCITY. WHEN THE WINNER OF  TODAY'S TOURNAMENT DRINKS THE BLOOD  OF THESE BEASTS, HE WILL HAVE ALL THESE  QUALITIES AND MORE. ONE WARRIOR WILL EARN  THE RIGHT TO WEAR THIS: THE NECKLACE OF INVINCIBILITY. NO ONE CAN HARM  THE MAN WHO WEARS IT. NO ONE. MAY THE BRAVEST AND  STRONGEST PREVAIL. LET THE BATTLE COMMENCE. [ YELLING ] VICTORY! NOT YET. THERE'S ONE MORE LEFT. A PAUSE BEFORE THE FINAL BOUT, A BOUT TO BE FOUGHT UNDER DIFFERENT RULES WITH DIFFERENT WEAPONS. WHEN ARKON RETURNS, A FIGHT TO THE DEATH. SEEMS A PITY THESE NOBLE BEASTS  HAVE TO DIE, DOESN'T IT? STILL, WHEN THE TIME COMES, I'LL  KILL THEM QUICKLY AND CLEANLY. WHAT? DID YOU THINK I'D GIVE YOU THE HONOUR OF PERFORMING  THE SACRIFICE? NO, BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING  TO BE DOING IT, EITHER. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  CALL THE GUARDS. I'M NO COWARD. I WILL SHOW THEM WHO YOU ARE... WHEN I RIP THE MASK  FROM YOUR SEVERED HEAD. I PROMISE YOU A QUICK DEATH. THANK YOU, I THINK. SHOULD YOU WIN, WOULD YOU  DO ME THE SAME HONOUR? HEY, SHARAK. ARJUNA. AM I GLAD TO SEE  THE TWO OF YOU. THAT MEANS, YOU'RE HERE,  THAT MEANS DAR'S NEARBY. HEY, ARJUNA. I UNDERSTAND. DAR'S STAFF. MAKE SURE YOU ALL SEE  ARKON'S MAGIC AT WORK! WATCH THE BLOOD  OF MEN AND ANIMALS STAIN OUR HOLY GROUNDS. SHUT UP, REON.  THIS IS CRAZINESS. YOU'RE ALL SO BLINDED  BY ARKON YOU ALLOW HIM TO STEAL THE FRUITS  OF YOUR LABOUR, THE BEAUTY OF YOUR YOUNG WOMEN. YOU PRAISE HIM EVEN  AS HE'S KILLING US. WAIT. I'LL SHUT HIS  MOUTH FOR HIM. MAKE IT LOOK LIKE I'VE HIT YOU. I WARN YOU; IN MY HANDS-- IN YOUR HANDS, IT'S  A WASTE OF TIME. THANKS FOR FINDING IT. DAR. WHAT'S WITH THE HELMET? SO WE'VE GOT  TO STOP ARKON. AND HE'S GOT RUH. THEY SAY THIS ARKON HAS  A HOLD OVER THE PEOPLE. IS IT SOME KIND OF MAGIC? I DON'T KNOW  WHAT IT IS. SLEIGHT OF HAND,  SMOKE AND MIRRORS. HIS DISAPPEARING;  HIS REAPPEARING. HE'S A MASTER OF ILLUSION. ILLUSION -- WELL, I KNOW  THE STRONGEST ILLUSIONS CAN BE BROKEN BY LAUGHTER. SO WHAT I COULD DO IS-- JUST BE READY. WHAT FOR? ANYTHING, TAO...  ANYTHING. IT IS ARKON'S COMMAND THAT THE BATTLE BE  CONDUCTED ON HORSEBACK. YOUR ATTENDANTS WAIT  WITH YOUR MOUNTS. IT WAS ARKON'S FERVENT DESIRE THAT THE DEVILS BESETTING THIS YOUNG MAN WOULD DEPART. SADLY, AS YOU HAVE ALL WITNESSED, THEY DID NOT. THEREFORE, AT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS CONTEST, REON WILL BE PUT TO DEATH BY THE VICTOR AND HIS BODY FED TO THESE ANIMALS BEFORE THEY, TOO, ARE SACRIFICED. AND, NOW, ARKON! STEP FORWARD. WHOA. LOOK OUT. WHOA, FRISKY ANIMAL. OH, I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID STEP FORWARD -- I-- WHATEVER YOU DO,  DON'T LOOK AT ARKON. WHAT? HE DOES SOMETHING WITH HIS EYES. MAY FORTUNE FAVOUR THE BEST MAN. YOU'RE GETTING  PERMISSION TO RIDE HIM? [ LAUGHING ] HE'S TELLING ME NOT  TO FALL OFF THIS TIME. I'VE NEVER SEEN  YOU RIDE BEFORE. I TOLD HIM IT  WOULDN'T BE FOR LONG, SO HE AGREED TO HELP. DAR. WHAT? YOU HAVE TO LAUGH. LAUGH? IT'S A FIGHT TO THE DEATH. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT YOU HAVE TO-- AAHHH! AIM AT ME!  LEAVE THE HORSES OUT OF THIS! IT'S HIM. IT'S THE BEASTMASTER. LAUGH! LAUGH...DAR! LAUGH! I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. HE'S TRYING TO KILL YOU. -LAUGH!  -THIS ISN'T FUNNY. THE HORSE IS FUNNY.  THINK ABOUT THE HORSE. NO, NO, NO, DON'T  THINK. JUST LAUGH. AHH! REMEMBER? THE BACK, IT HURTS  WHEN YOU THINK. THIS IS AN ILLUSION, DAR. LAUGHING BREAKS THE ILLUSION. OH, I THINK THAT HURT. [ LAUGHING ] COME ON, DAR. THAT'S THE WAY. LAUGH, DAR. [ LAUGHING ] AH, DAR! [ LAUGHING ] [ LAUGHING ] QUICK AND CLEAN, YOU PROMISED. I'M NOT GOING TO KILL YOU. I DON'T WANT TO.  BUT YOU OWE ME YOUR LIFE. SO, TELL YOU WHAT. GIVE ME A CHUCKLE. HA-HA. COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT. LAUGH. THAT'S IT. LAUGH. LAUGH. [ LAUGHING ] [ LAUGHING ] KILL THEM! IT'S OVER, ARKON. THAT WON'T WORK ANY MORE, ARKON. I KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING. YOU GOING SOMEWHERE? KILL HIM! LISTEN! KILL HIM! KILL HIM! LISTEN TO ME. YOU COULD KILL HIM. IT WOULD BE NO MORE  THAN HE DESERVES. BUT IF YOU TRY TO SOLVE  YOUR PROBLEMS BY KILLING, THEN HE WILL HAVE WON. AND NOTHING WILL CHANGE. DAR'S RIGHT. THEN WHAT DO  WE DO WITH HIM? YOU DON'T HAVE TO  DO ANYTHING ANY MORE. HE NO LONGER HAS  ANY POWER OVER YOU. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
