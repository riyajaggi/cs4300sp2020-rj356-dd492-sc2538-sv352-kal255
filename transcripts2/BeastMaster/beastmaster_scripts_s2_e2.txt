 THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... LEAVE ME ALONE. GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME! I'M NOT GOING TO LET YOU FALL. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU? YOU'RE INSULTING OUR GODS. I HAVE TO DIE. ARE YOU BOYS GOING TO  FEED ME? GIVE ME SHELTER? NO, I DIDN'T THINK SO. I DON'T WANT TO STARVE TO DEATH. I DON'T WANT TO BE TORN APART BY AN ANIMAL -- BE GOOD;  I'LL DO WHAT I MUST. BUT YOUR  PEOPLE, THEY-- OH, THEY CAN'T FEED  THE MOUTHS THEY HAVE. YOU SEE ME? I'M A USELESS OLD WOMAN. I'VE HAD MY FUNERAL. BUT ISN'T THERE ANYONE WHO CAN-- I DID...A SON, BUT HE HAD  TO GO AND BE A MAN. HE DIED? HE DIDN'T COME BACK. NONE OF THEM DID. WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN  HE'S DEAD. NO ONE EVER RETURNS  FROM CHASING SHARK-WOMEN. -SHARK-WOMEN?  -WHERE DO YOU LIVE? THERE'S NO USE TAKING ME THERE. AS SOON AS YOU'VE GONE, THEY'LL JUST BRING  ME BACK HERE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET YOU DIE. [ CRYING ] THREE OF OUR YOUNG MEN TOOK  MY SON TO CHASE SHARK-WOMEN. NOW I HAVE NOBODY TO CARE FOR ME. USUALLY, OLD PEOPLE ONLY GET  TAKEN TO MERCY HILL IN THE DRY SEASON, WHEN THE WAY ISN'T FLOODED. OHHH... A CROCODILE, A BIG ONE. I BELIEVE  DAR IS ASKING HIM TO LET US PASS. WELL, WHAT IF  THE CROC SAYS NO? THAT DOESN'T  USUALLY HAPPEN. WELL, IF HE DOES SAY NO, YOU'LL HAVE SAVED ME TO BECOME A MEAL FOR A CROCODILE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANGRY. HE'LL STAY HERE, SO THEY  WON'T BE FRIGHTENED. THEY'LL BE FRIGHTENED  ENOUGH WHEN THEY SEE ME. IT'S HER.  SHE'S BACK FROM-- THERE'S NO NEED  TO BE FRIGHTENED. SHE'S ALIVE. WHO ARE YOU? I'M DAR. -HIM?  -TAO THE-- WHERE'S THE MEN  WHO ACCOMPANIED HER? YOU'D BETTER LISTEN.  HE'S THE BEASTMASTER. HE HAS-- I DON'T WANT  TO CAUSE ANY TROUBLE. TAKE HER BACK AND CARE FOR HER. IT'S WRONG TO KILL YOUR ELDERS. WHO ARE YOU TO COMMAND US? WE HAD HER FUNERAL ALREADY.  SHE'S DEAD. -BUT SHE'S NOT DEAD.  -SHE'S DEAD. YOU CAN SEE THAT SHE'S NOT DEAD. THE GODS ARE WAITING  FOR HER SOUL. YOU STOLE IT. ARGH! I SAID I DON'T WANT TROUBLE. HE HAS A TIGER  HIDDEN IN THE TREES! PLEASE, IF YOU -WANT HER, TAKE HER.  -WE CAN'T CARE FOR HER. YOU CAN'T LEAVE HER HERE.  SHE HAS NO ONE. HOW DO YOU KNOW -- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THE YOUNG  MEN ARE DEAD. DID YOU LOOK FOR THEM? NO MAN RETURNS FROM  THE SHARK-WOMEN. I'M SURE YOU BELIEVE THAT STORY, BUT HAS ANYONE HERE  SEEN A SHARK-WOMAN? OH, YOU HAVEN'T? THERE ARE MANY THINGS  WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT EXIST -- THE GODS,  THEY EXIST. HOLD ON A MINUTE. I'M REMEMBERING SOMETHING. THERE ARE MANY LEGENDS  ALONG THIS SHORELINE. I HAVEN'T HEARD THIS ONE  ABOUT SHARK-WOMEN. BUT, UH, OUR STORY TELLERS  TALK ABOUT THIS ISLAND, AND THEY SAY THAT THE WOMEN  ARE SO BEAUTIFUL THAT THE MEN DON'T  WANT TO RETURN. SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WELL, WE CAN'T LET HER DIE. ALL RIGHT. LOOK, WE'LL GO AND  LOOK FOR YOUR MEN. YOU WON'T FIND THEM. WOULD YOU FEED HER  UNTIL WE RETURN? WE CAN'T FEED  THE MOUTHS WE HAVE. IF YOU LEAVE, SHE GOES RIGHT TO MERCY HILL. [ SIGHING ] [ YELLING ] WHERE'S YOUR HUT? STAY INSIDE. HE'LL PROTECT YOU. HIS NAME IS RUH. WHERE ARE THE BOATS? WHAT IF YOU DON'T COME BACK? HE'LL STAY WITH YOU  UNLESS I'M DEAD. -HE'LL KNOW?  -YES. WELL...WHO'S GOING TO FEED HIM? I DON'T WANT HIM GETTING HUNGRY. THEY WON'T KEEP HIM LONG.  THEY'RE HARDLY A SNACK. KODO AND PODO  WILL FIND HIM FOOD. HEAR THAT, LITTLE BEGGARS --  YOU HAVE TO FORAGE FOR SOMEONE ELSE FOR A CHANGE -- IF YOU  DON'T, YOU WIND UP A MEAL. WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE WOULD PUT  THEIR ELDERS TO DEATH? PEOPLE WHO LOST TOO MANY  OF THEIR YOUNG MEN AT SEA. MEN NEVER NEEDED MUCH  URGING TO GO TO SEA... OR CHASING AFTER WOMEN. BOTH ACTIVITIES CAN BE FATAL. AND THIS WHOLE LEGEND ABOUT SHARK-WOMEN LURING YOUNG MEN. IS THERE A WAY  OF EXPLAINING THAT? TRUTH IS, MEN GO TO SEA  CHASING THEM, AND THEY'RE NEVER SEEN AGAIN. WHAT IF IT ISN'T A LEGEND? I'D RATHER BELIEVE  IT'S MY ISLAND OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN INSTEAD. DO YOU THINK THAT'S IT? IT'S AN ISLAND.  WE KNOW THAT MUCH. WE ALSO KNOW MOST  LEGENDS ARE LIES. WE'RE NOT STAYING, RIGHT? WE'RE NOT STAYING. RIGHT. OHHH! WHO ARE YOU? WHERE ARE YOU FROM? YOU'RE HANDSOME. WHAT'S  YOUR NAME? MY NAME IS DAR. I'M TAO, TAO THE MAGNIFICENT. THIS IS STRANGE, VERY STRANGE. WE'RE LOOKING  FOR THREE MEN AND A BOY. THEY FOLLOWED  SOME WOMEN OUT TO SEA. A BOY...THREE MEN? -WHEN WAS THIS? THE LAST  -FULL MOON. YES, THEY WERE HERE. WELL, WHERE ARE THEY NOW? THEY GOT ANXIOUS  ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES. THEIR TRIBES  KILL PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO ONE TO SUPPORT THEM. WELL, THEY DIDN'T MAKE IT BACK. THE REEF! WE WARNED THEM ABOUT THE REEF. IT COMPLETELY  SURROUNDS THE ISLAND. YOU CAN'T SEE NOW,  BUT IT'S PASSABLE, ON THE SPRING TIDE, LIKE NOW. THEY SAID THEY KNEW THE WAY, BUT THERE ARE MANY SHARKS. IARA! IARA! IARA IS OUR LEADER. WHO ARE YOU? MY NAME IS DAR. THIS IS MY FRIEND, TAO. ARE YOU A WARRIOR? WHEN I HAVE TO BE. WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN TEACH US. WE CAN'T STAY. BUT WE'RE JUST WOMEN HERE. WE'VE ONLY THE REEF  TO PROTECT US. WE SHOULD BE GOING. IT'S GOING TO BE DARK SOON. YOU DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT ON THE REEF IN THE DARK. DAR, I THINK SHE HAS A POINT. ALL RIGHT. NOW SHE HAS THE VILLAGE, AND  WE'RE HOMELESS IN THE JUNGLE. THERE ARE TRADERS WHO WOULD GIVE 20 PIGS  FOR A TIGER LIKE THAT. ARE YOU SAYING  WE SHOULD CAPTURE IT? NO, KILL HIM. ALL THE TRADERS  WANT ARE THE PARTS. THE HEAD AND THE SKIN FOR MEN WHO WANT  TO LOOK MORE IMPORTANT. THE TEETH AND THE CLAWS  TO LOOK MORE DANGEROUS. THERE ARE EVEN PARTS FOR MEN  WHO CAN'T PLEASE WOMEN. LET'S KILL IT. CAN YOU DO AS WELL? I'VE NEVER  USED ONE. OH, COME, LET ME SHOW YOU. DAR, ALL RIGHT. THERE YOU GO. YOU PUT THE ARROW  ON THE WRONG SIDE. JUST...LIKE THAT. NOW, SIGHT THE TARGET,  ALONG THE ARROW. MAGIC, MAGIC, HA, HA. WHOA, LOOK OUT. DON'T WORRY. SHE CAN WHIP MOST MEN. ALL RIGHT. SORRY. ENOUGH. OH.. WE DON'T WANT TO WEAR HIM OUT. HERE, COVER  THE TOP. THAT'S ENOUGH. COME ON, TIGER. SMELLS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? -COME ON.  -HIDE. THAT'S RIGHT. THE HAND COMES  OFF, THAT'S IT. YEAH, LIKE THAT. I GET IT. HOW DO  YOU KNOW? HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT ALL  OF THE CHILDREN ARE GIRLS? I HAVEN'T SEEN  A SINGLE BOY HERE. THE ONLY MALES ARE THE PIGS. THEY'RE ALL MALE. STRANGE, ISN'T IT? WHAT DO YOU WANT? IT WON'T TALK TO ME. THEY LIKE YOU. THEY WON'T LET US NEAR THEM. MAYBE THEY  KNOW SOMETHING. YOU'RE RIGHT, THEY'RE SMART. THEY KNOW THEY'RE  GOING TO GET EATEN. FOOD. OH, SORRY, AHEM. YOU'VE ALREADY GOT A GOOD  TEACHER OF SELF-DEFENCE. WELL THEN, MAYBE OUR ARCHER  CAN TEACH YOU A FEW THINGS. ONLY HOW TO KILL. I DON'T KILL. NO? NO. OH. SO, WHERE DO YOU  KEEP ALL THE BOY BABIES -- I DON'T  SEE ANY AROUND. WE GIVE THEM TO THE MEN. THERE ARE  MEN HERE? YEAH, THE OTHER SIDE  OF THE MOUNTAIN. WE DON'T SEE THEM MUCH. WE USED TO LET THEM LIVE WITH  US, BUT ALL THEY DID WAS EAT AND FIGHT AND SLEEP  AND BEAT US UP... AND TAUGHT US HOW  TO DEFEND OURSELVES. YOU CAN'T CHANGE A MAN. I DON'T AGREE. YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT? TRY NOT TO BE. [ CHUCKLING ] YOU SURE EAT LIKE A MAN. YOU'RE NOT SO CLEAN  YOURSELF, HUH? IS THAT SO? HA, THAT IS SO. THAT IS VERY SO. I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO GO CLEAN  MYSELF THEN, WON'T I? RACE ME TO THE WATER. OHHH! HA, HA, HA. THE GIRLS DON'T SEE  MEN VERY OFTEN. I WANT TO GET YOU SOMETHING. [ GIGGLING ] MY PEOPLE DON'T  BELIEVE IN FIGHTING. THEY BELIEVE IN A PROPER  RESPECT FOR WOMEN. AHHH! COME ON. THEY BELIEVE THAT EVERYTHING  CAN BE SOLVED BY DISCUSSION. EVERYTHING? WELL, THERE ARE SOME THINGS... IARA, NO, IARA, NO! IARA, NO!

AHHH, THE BOY'S  MOTHER'S WAITING. FOR BAD NEWS. LET HER HOPE FOR  A FEW MORE DAYS. LET HER LIVE. WE WILL. WE'LL KEEP LOOKING. THERE'S ALWAYS  A CHANCE. I DON'T THINK YOU LIKE IT HERE. NO, I DO, I JUST... I JUST DON'T  UNDERSTAND IT. WHAT IS IT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND? SOMETHING TO REMEMBER ME BY. SNAKES ARE...  BEAUTIFUL CREATURES. DON'T YOU THINK? COMING IN? WHAT IS IT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND? WHY ARE THERE NO FEMALE PIGS? NO FEMALE PIGS? HA, HA. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -THERE AREN'T ANY.  -WELL, YOU CHECKED? TAO CHECKED. -REALLY?  -REALLY.

I TOLD HIM HIS FRIEND WENT OVER THE MOUNTAIN TO MEET THE MEN. HE WON'T BELIEVE ME. YAH...YAH. THE MEN LET  THEM OUT AGAIN. THEY SNEAK OVER THE MOUNTAIN AT NIGHT TRYING AND CATCH WOMEN. WHEN THEY CAN'T,  THEY LET THE PIGS GO. HOW DO I GET OVER THE MOUNTAIN? HE'LL BE BACK. COME, WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT. OH, HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL. DON'T YOU LIKE US? WE LIKE YOU. BACK AND FORTH. BACK AND FORTH. HE'S NOT GOING TO GO  FOR IT, I TELL YOU. THE BEASTMASTER  TOLD HIM TO STAY.. AND HE'S GOING TO STAY THERE. THAT'S IT. WHAT? THIS IS GOING TO BE  EASIER THAN I THOUGHT.

AND WHY DID YOU COME TO THIS AWFUL PLACE? I KNOW -- HUMANS. SOME HAVE TO KILL EVERYTHING... YOU HAVE TO SAVE EVERYTHING... WHEN I GAVE HIM TO YOU,  YOU SWORE YOU'D PROTECT HIM.
