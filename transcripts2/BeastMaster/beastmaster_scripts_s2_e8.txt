 HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... THE MIST IN THIS FOREST IS  STRANGE. HAVE YOU NOTICED? WHAT ABOUT IT? THE WAY LIGHT  HITS IT, FOR ONE. IT'S SOFT LIKE A BABY'S HAND. WATER'S LIKE THAT. YET POWERFUL ENOUGH  TO CARVE A CANYON THROUGH A MOUNTAIN OF ROCK. IT CAN DO  THAT, TOO. I DON'T THINK KODO  AND PODO LIKE IT. WELL, WITH ANY LUCK,  THEY'LL GET LOST IN IT. I HATE IT WHEN HE  STOPS LIKE THAT. IS SOMETHING WRONG? HE'S AFRAID. HE CAN'T SEE. RUH'S AFRAID? A LITTLE. YOU TELL HIM THAT  GREAT THINKERS SAY IF YOU CAN SEE THROUGH FEAR, THEN YOU'RE FINE. YOU AGREE WITH THAT? WELL, UP TO A POINT. I MEAN, IF A TIGER'S NERVOUS,  WHO AM I TO-- DAR? AHH...MUCH CLEARER. FEELING BETTER THERE, BIG GUY? [ RUSTLING ] THAT'S CURUPIRA. WHAT DOES SHE WANT? PROBABLY WANTS  TO YELL AT ME. TELL THE LITTLE DEMON  WE'VE GOT BUSINESS. WE'RE TRAVELLING TO  THE MIDDLE OF THE WORLD, WHERE THE DEMONS  ARE FRIENDLIER... AND WHERE FERRETS ARE FED TO LIONS AND BEARS  FOR SNACKS -- ARGH. YOU'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT'S LIKE  TO BE LONELY, HAVEN'T YOU? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. YOU WILL. I'LL BE LONELY? IS THAT WHY YOU BROUGHT ME HERE? YOU'LL WISH IT WERE. IF I WISHED YOU TO BE WITH ME, TO COME WITH ME, TO LEAVE HERE RIGHT NOW,  WOULD YOU DO THAT? -WHY?  -IF YOU LIKED ME, BEASTMASTER, YOU'D  JUST SAY "YES". I DO LIKE YOU. BUT MY FRIEND AND I, WE'RE TRAVELLING-- THERE'S DEATH IN THIS FOREST. THERE'S DEATH  IN EVERY FOREST. IN THIS ONE,  IT'S WAITING FOR US. BE CAREFUL. BEWARE OF THE MIST...  IT PLAYS TRICKS. -IT OPENS CRACKS.  -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU COULD STEP INTO THE FUTURE. AND MEET MY DEATH? DEATH IS ALWAYS  WAITING IN THE FUTURE. UNTIL IT ISN'T. WHERE IS IT? I TOLD YOU: IN THE MIST. WHAT DO YOU TWO  LITTLE RATS WANT? I SUPPOSE YOU'RE HUNGRY. WELL... FIND YOUR OWN FOOD. STOP IT...STOP IT! YOU ARE INCORRIGIBLE --  IF I COULD CHOOSE, OVER THE CLIFF YOU'D GO --  I WASN'T JOKING ABOUT FERRETS BEING FED  TO LIONS AND BEARS FOR SNACKS. I'M NOT. WHAT DID LITTLE  BACKWARDS-FEET HAVE TO SAY? SHE SAID THIS FOREST  IS VERY DANGEROUS. WELL, I COULD'VE TOLD YOU THAT. SHE ALSO SAID THAT  DEATH IS WAITING HERE... IN THE MIST. TERRONS? NO, HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. THERE'S NO TRACKS, EITHER. WELL...WHAT KIND OF DEATH? MONSTERS? SORCERERS? DISEASE? WAS SHE SPECIFIC? SHE SAID SOMETHING  ABOUT BEING LONELY. LONELY? YOU'RE NOT ALONE. EVERY ANIMAL IN THE  FOREST IS YOUR FRIEND. HOW COULD YOU BE LONELY? HAVE YOU SEEN  KODO AND PODO? OH, THEY'RE ACTING  CRAZY, AS USUAL. THEY'RE LIKE A BAD DREAM:  NEVER COMPLETELY GO AWAY. I THINK WE SHOULD  JUST KEEP MOVING. ABSOLUTELY --  THE QUICKER WE GET OUT OF THIS STRANGE  MIST, THE BETTER. DAR, MAYBE WE SHOULD HEAD BACK. WE'RE GOING  THE RIGHT WAY. IT'S GETTING THICKER. WHAT? SOMETHING WRONG? IT'S RUH. HE'S AFRAID AGAIN? MORE THIS TIME. OF WHAT? HE DOESN'T KNOW. THERE'S SOMETHING  OUT THERE. -WHAT IS IT?  -I DON'T KNOW. BUT IF IT'S AN ANIMAL,  IT WON'T TALK TO ME. GREAT. PROBABALY ISN'T REAL, THEN. OR AN ENEMY. WHAT IS IT? IT MUST BE SORCERY.  CURUPIRA WARNED YOU. ALL THE MORE  REASON TO STAY BACK. RUH? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I DON'T THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO. THINGS JUST CAN'T DISAPPEAR. THE MIST MUST HAVE COME AND TAKEN HIM SOMEWHERE. -WHERE ARE YOU GOING?  -TO FIND IT. TO FIND RUH. KODO AND PODO DISAPPEAR.  NOW RUH. WHAT NEXT? CURUPIRA SAID  I WOULD KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE  TO BE ALONE. TERRIFIC. THAT MEANS I'M NEXT. WHAT ABOUT SHARAK? WE HAVEN'T  SEEN HIM ALL DAY. WHERE IS HE? HE'S IN THE SANCTUARY. WELL, AT LEAST  HE'S SAFE. WE'VE DONE WELL, MOHAN. NOW I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A LITTLE FUN. IARA? WELL, SHOW YOURSELF... IF YOU DARE. WHY DON'T YOU COME  OUT HERE WHERE I CAN GET A HAND ON YOU? I HAVE BEEN IN YOUR WORLD. HAVEN'T YOU NOTICED? YOU TOOK MY WHITE TIGER! AND YOUR BEASTMASTER. I KNOW THAT YOU LOVE HIM,  BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM. -I DO, AND I WILL.  -YOU CAN'T, IARA. YOU KILL THE ONES YOU LOVE. I'M ONLY PREPARING HIM  FOR LIFE WITHOUT YOU. YOU'RE AN IMMATURE, UNPLEASANT LITTLE GIRL. HE DESERVES BETTER...A WOMAN. AT LEAST, I'M CAPABLE OF LOVE. YOU -- YOU CAN  ONLY LOVE ANIMALS. THE ANIMALS AND THE  FORESTS ARE MINE! YOUR WORLD IS IN  THE MUCK AND SLIME AND THE COLD SALT OF THE OCEANS. WHY DON'T YOU  STAY THERE? BECAUSE I LIKE  YOUR WORLD, CURUPIRA. AND WHEN YOU'RE GONE, TRAPPED FOREVER BENEATH  THE MUCK AND THE SLIME, I'LL HAVE IT ALL. WHY DON'T YOU  COME NOW, CURUPIRA? GIVE IT UP; COME NOW. THIS IS TOO STRANGE. IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME THAT  IT WANTS US TO GO THIS WAY. SO NOW THE MIST IS TELLING  US WHICH DIRECTION TO GO? RUH'S DISAPPEARING WASN'T  RATIONAL EITHER, TAO. NO, AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND  WHY YOU WANT HIM BACK. GOOD. THEN LET'S GO. NO...I DON'T THINK WE  SHOULD BE HERE AT ALL. I HEARD THIS STORY:  TWO BRAVE MEN, WARRIORS, LIKE YOU AND I, HAD A FRIEND THAT DISAPPEARED INSIDE A CAVE. INSTEAD OF ASKING  SOMEONE IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THE CAVE AND  WHAT WAS INSIDE IT, THEY JUST WALKED STRAIGHT IN...  STRAIGHT INTO AN ABYSS. AND THEY WERE NEVER SEEN  OR HEARD FROM AGAIN. AND THIS MIST TAO, DO WE KNOW ANYONE WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS MIST? ONLY CURUPIRA. AND I WOULDN'T  PUT MY LIFE IN HER HANDS. BUT I DID ONCE. AND SHE GAVE ME MY POWERS. SO, YOU CAN STAY  HERE IF YOU LIKE. BUT I'M GOING TO  SAVE MY FRIENDS... BECAUSE I KNOW THEY  WOULD DO THE SAME FOR ME. DAR... SO WOULD I. BESIDES, WHAT'S AN ABYSS? A LITTLE BIT OF MIST? CAN'T BE ALL THAT BAD. COMING? DAR, I'M NERVOUS. IT LOOKS  LIKE A WOMAN. DEATH CAN BE A WOMAN,  IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE. COME ON. WELCOME. WE SAW YOUR FIRE. GREY SMOKE, WET WOOD... LIKE EVERYTHING IN THIS FOREST. I THINK IT'S BEAUTIFUL HERE. I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL IT THAT. SOMETHING DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT. THIS ISN'T REAL. I DON'T  THINK SHE IS, EITHER. IT'S VERY REAL. AND, I ASSURE YOU,  I AM, TOO. SEE? I'M FLESH AND  BLOOD...LIKE YOU. TELL ME ABOUT  THIS PLACE. WE'RE STRANGERS HERE. WHAT WOULD YOU  LIKE TO KNOW? ABOUT THE MIST. WELL, IT  COVERS THINGS, MAKES THEM  DIFFICULT TO SEE. THAT CAN BE GOOD...AND BAD. LIKE ANYTHING THAT'S  NOT UNDERSTOOD. BUT THERE ARE  IMPORTANT THINGS TO LEARN IN  THIS FOREST. SOME ANIMAL FRIENDS  OF MINE ARE LOST HERE. WILL THEY FIND  THEIR WAY OUT? A QUICK WAY. THE QUICKEST WAY OUT IS DEATH. BRAVE MEN LIKE YOU  UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU HAVE MANY CHANCES TO DIE, BUT FATE WILL ONLY  GIVE YOU ONE DEATH. IT'S WAITING FOR YOU HERE...  IN THE MIST. WHICH ONE WILL KILL  YOU, BEASTMASTER? AAHHH! -I COULD SEE EVERYTHING BUT--  -IT'S NOT RUH. WHAT? THE TIGER  THAT WAS HERE-- -IT WASN'T HIM.  -HOW CAN YOU TELL? THE MARKS  ON HIS FACE. NO TWO TIGERS  ARE THE SAME. YOU NEED TO CLEAN  THESE WOUNDS. I HAVE SOME HERBS  THAT WILL HELP. THE SENTINEL IN THE BURNING  FOREST...THEY WEREN'T REAL. BUT THESE ARE. BUT THEY DIDN'T KILL YOU...  EVEN IF THEY TRIED. THEY WEREN'T THE DEATH THAT  CURUPIRA SAYS IS WAITING HERE. NO, THAT'S STILL  OUT THERE... ALL THE MORE REASON THAT WE  SHOULD AVOID IT AT ALL COST. DO YOU THINK  WE HAVE A CHOICE? WE COULD BE AT THE SANCTUARY;  WE COULD BE AT XINCA. WE COULD BE ANYWHERE  EXCEPT HERE. WE HAVE THAT CHOICE. THAT'S NOT HOW  IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. HOW'S IT SUPPOSED TO BE? DO YOU BELIEVE IN FATE? FATE JUST MOVES US AROUND LIKE THE WIND BLOWS THE LEAVES. -FATE INVOLVED ME FOR A REASON.  -AND FREE WILL? WHAT ABOUT IT? --  THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN THE WAY THEY'RE  SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN. -AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT?  -NO. WHY HAS FATE BROUGHT YOU HERE? SO I CAN FIND MY DEATH. -THAT'S TERRIBLE.  -NOT WHEN YOU COME TO TERMS WITH IT. ARE YOU FRIGHTENED? NO. I GUESS THAT'S  A GOOD THING. ARE YOU? YES. THEN THINGS ARE AS  THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE. HOW DO YOU FIGURE THAT? YOU TOLD ME YOUR NAME WAS "TAO". YOU SAID IT MEANT "THE WAY". YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY EVEN  IF YOU ARE FRIGHTENED. I'M ON MY WAY. THAT'S ALSO A GOOD THING. HERE...BEHIND YOU. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THERE? THE ANCIENT ONE  HAD A SNIT AND REPLACED ME. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? ME? YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER, HAVE YOU? TALL, BLONDE. HE LIKES TALL BLONDES. BUT WHAT DID YOU DO? IT WAS A MATTER  OF THE HEART... AND A SORCERESS IS NOT  SUPPOSED TO HAVE ONE. AND SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED  TO FALL IN LOVE. AND YOU? WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE? ONE OF THE ANIMALS I LOVE MOST IN THE WORLD...  HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. MY WHITE TIGER. IARA DID IT -- TO LURE ME INTO HER MIST --  SO SHE CAN GET RID OF ME AND TAKE OVER MY WORLD. WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT IT? I WAS HOPING FOR YOUR HELP. AS YOU CAN SEE, I'M POWERLESS. ALSO TAKING THE BEASTMASTER  INTO THE MIST. SHE LOVES HIM, WHICH MEANS I'VE GROWN TO BE QUITE...  FOND OF HIM. WELL, HE'S HUMAN, OF COURSE...BUT THAT'S NOT AND HE'S USED WELL  THE POWERS I GAVE HIM. I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T  DESTROY HIM TOO. CURUPIRA. WHATEVER HAPPENS,  I WISH YOU LUCK. THE SAME TO YOU. IT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING  WE COULD BOTH USE. EVERYTHING LOOKS THE SAME. NO, IT'S DIFFERENT. HOW CAN YOU TELL? THE TREES. THE TREES. YOU'RE AMAZING. ALL I SEE IS MIST, MIST,  MIST AND MORE MIST. I FEEL LIKE WE'RE  WALKING AROUND IN CIRCLES. IF I COULD LAY  MY HANDS ON HER... I WOULD MAKE HER SHOW US A WAY... TAO? ...I WOULD TEACH HER A LESSON. ...IF I COULD LAY MY HANDS  ON HER, YOU KNOW, I WOULD MAKE HER SHOW US A WAY  TO GET OUT OF THIS FOREST. I WOULD, I WOULD  TEACH HER A LESSON. ...SHE MAY BE  BEAUTIFUL...BUT SHE'S LIKE A WILD DOG WITH A BAD TEMPER. BUT SHE'S LIKE A WILD DOG  WITH A BAD TEMPER. AND...I KNOW A LOT  OF WOMEN LIKE THAT -- IT'S FUNNY, THEY SEEM TO BE  THE ONES YOU REMEMBER. DAR? TAO! DAR. DAR...DAR! STOP! I SAID STOP. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?  WHERE ARE YOU GOING? WHERE'S MY FRIEND? TAO! TAO! TAO. CAN YOU SEE ME? TAO? [ DESTINE ]: NOW YOU'RE  ALONE, BEASTMASTER. ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE GONE. YOU'RE ALL ALONE. DON'T YOU WANT TO FIND THEM? WHERE ARE YOU? CAN'T SEE YOU. IT'S YOUR TIME NOW. MY TIME? TIME FOR WHAT? DEATH IS WAITING, BEASTMASTER. WE ALL FACE IT ALONE. COME...FIND IT. DAR! TAO? WHERE ARE YOU? HERE. TAO! THIS WAY. FOOL -- DON'T YOU EVER LEARN? WHY DO YOU DO THAT? -BECAUSE I CAN.  -I'M GLAD YOU'RE HAVING FUN WHILE  SOMETHING'S TRYING TO KILL ME. [ SIGHING ] YOU'RE NOT HAPPY. I CAN TELL. WHY DON'T YOU JUST  LEAVE THIS FOREST? BECAUSE I'VE LOST TAO  AND I'VE LOST RUH-- OH, YOU'RE ALWAYS  LOSING SOMETHING. WHAT IF YOU LOST ME? WHY DO YOU ASK ME THAT? ANSWER THE QUESTION. I'D TRY TO FIND YOU. YOU WOULD? YES. WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T? -WHAT IF I WERE GONE FOREVER?  -WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? MAKE ME A PROMISE, BEASTMASTER. IF THIS EVER HAPPENS,  YOU CAN'T SAVE ME. BUT SAVE MY ANIMALS, AND SAVE MY FOREST. PROMISE ME? THAT'S WHY YOU  GAVE ME THE POWERS. THAT'S WHY I'M A BEASTMASTER.  OF COURSE I WILL. I PROMISE. GOOD. AND SAVE MY WHITE TIGER. IARA LIED TO HIM. IARA? TO SAVE HIM, YOU HAVE TO  TELL HIM THE TRUTH. -THEN HE WON'T KILL YOU.  -HE WANTS TO KILL ME? IF YOU LET HIM. BUT I CAN'T TALK TO HIM... AND WHAT'S THE TRUTH? DO I HAVE TO  TELL YOU EVERYTHING? MAKE HIM TALK TO YOU. USE YOUR POWERS. IARA LIED TO HIM. SHE ALWAYS LIES. IF YOU TELL HIM THE TRUTH, THAT'S ENOUGH  TO BREAK ANY CURSE. TELL HIM THE TRUTH, AND HE'LL LISTEN  TO YOU...INSTEAD OF HER. WHERE WILL I FIND HIM? HE'S LOOKING FOR YOU. HE SHOULDN'T BE HARD TO FIND. AND... REMEMBER YOUR PROMISE,  BEASTMASTER. [ IARA ]: HELLO, LITTLE DEMON. I RULE HERE, IARA. THE FOREST IS MINE. TAKE YOUR FOUL MIST AND LEAVE MY FOREST. WELCOME TO MY WORLD. STRUGGLE AGAINST ME? NOT IN THE MIST YOU DON'T. IT'S WATER... AND IT GIVES ME MORE  STRENGTH THAN ALL ANIMALS IN ALL YOUR FORESTS. I HAVE YOUR WHITE TIGER. SOON...I'LL HAVE YOUR -YOU'LL NEVER HAVE HIM.  -AS SOON AS I HAVE... YOU. WATER IS STRONGER. OHH... FINISHED, MY DEAR? AWW, ALL USED UP, ARE WE? WELL, I'M NOT. YOU KISS YOUR VICTIMS, DON'T YOU? SUCK THE LIFE FROM THEIR BODIES. IS THAT WHAT I SHOULD DO TO YOU? NO... SOMETHING MORE APPROPRIATE. SOMETHING FROM MY WORLD. THE MUCK AND S-S-SLIME. THE COLD SALT OF THE OCEANS. WHO ARE YOU? WHERE'S MY  FRIEND, TAO? I TOLD YOU.  ALL OF THEM ARE GONE. GONE WHERE? YOU ASK SIMPLE QUESTIONS, BEASTMASTER, BUT THERE ARE  NO SIMPLE ANSWERS. I COULD MAKE YOU TELL ME. WELL, THAT MIGHT BE FUN. WHAT ARE YOU CALLED? DESTINE, FATE, KISMET. DESTINY. CHOOSE WHICHEVER  YOU LIKE. WELL, IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT...  IT'S WHAT WILL BE. AND THERE'S ONLY  ONE WAY TO KNOW. CATCH ME, BEASTMASTER. CATCH ME AND YOU'LL KNOW. LOOK, BEASTMASTER... LOOK WHO'S HERE. YOU CAN'T SAVE ME... BUT SAVE MY ANIMALS... AND SAVE MY FOREST. DAR! IARA. IT WAS YOU? YOU'RE DESTINE. -YOU PUT CURUPIRA--  -YES... AND NOW YOU NEED ME. WHAT DID YOU TELL  THE WHITE TIGER? THAT I'D MAKE HIM HUMAN. BUT IT'S OVER. I'VE WON. I DON'T NEED TO KEEP  THAT PROMISE NOW, DO I? WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS HE? LYING IN WAIT FOR YOU. -I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM.  -YOU CAN'T. I HAVE CURUPIRA. YOUR POWERS COME FROM HER. AND SHE'S NOT  COMING BACK HERE...EVER. I'M GOING TO TRY. HE'LL KILL YOU. [ DAR ]: MOHAN, I'M NOT HERE  TO FIGHT YOU. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH. I KNOW YOU NEVER  HUNTED ME ON YOUR OWN. YOU WERE CURSED  BY THE DEMON IARA. BUT SHE LIED TO YOU. SHE ISN'T GOING  TO MAKE YOU HUMAN. AND IF SHE DID, IT WOULD MAKE  YOUR LIFE LESS THAN IT IS, BECAUSE THE TIGER IS THE MOST  NOBLE CREATURE ON THIS EARTH. AND I RESPECT YOU  FOR WHO YOU ARE. AND I HOPE YOU RESPECT ME  FOR WHO I AM... A SERVANT TO YOU  AND YOUR KINGDOM. I'LL SEE YOU SOON. THANK YOU, MOHAN. THE WHITE TIGER LISTENED TO ME. SO I STILL HAVE THE POWERS  THAT CURUPIRA GAVE ME. I TOLD MOHAN THE TRUTH, IARA. YOU CAN'T STOP THE TRUTH. BUT I GOT WHAT I WANTED. AND THAT'S ALSO... THE TRUTH. LET CURUPIRA GO. [ LAUGHING ] I DON'T THINK SO. UNLESS YOU COME WITH ME. BE WITH ME IN MY WORLD. THINK ABOUT IT, DAR. WHAT ABOUT MY FRIENDS? YOU HAVE NO  USE FOR THEM. YOU CAN HAVE THEM. I DID GET WHAT I REALLY WANTED. BUT WE'LL SEE EACH OTHER  AGAIN, BEASTMASTER. AND NEXT TIME,  I WON'T BE SO GENEROUS. DAR... DID YOU SEE  THE WHITE TIGER? I DID. AND IT DIDN'T  KILL YOU. IT MUST NOT  BE YOUR DESTINY. YOU KNOW, MAYBE ONE DAY  IT WILL BE, BUT...FOR CURUPIRA  IT WAS DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT? HOW? IARA TOOK HER TO HER WORLD. I'LL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN. I KNOW SHE MEANT  A LOT TO YOU. THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO  IS TO REMEMBER. THAT WAY THE  SPIRIT LIVES ON. I WILL. I PROMISED. WELL, THEN... WE SHOULD GET  OUT OF HERE -- THAT INCLUDES  THE TWO OF YOU. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
