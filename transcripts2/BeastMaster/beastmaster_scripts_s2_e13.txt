 PITY. MY CAMP IS FULL OF WARRIORS  WHOSE REASONS FOR BEING HERE ARE OF LITTLE CONCERN  TO ME, BUT YOU... YOU WOULD BE WISE  TO CONCERN YOURSELF WITH SOME OF THE OTHERS... LIKE MILOS. MILOS? NO, NO, HE DOESN'T CONCERN ME. -MILOS, LOOK.  -I SEE HIM. AFTER THEM.  BRING BACK THEIR PELTS. AROUND THIS WAY! THIS IS ONE CUB WHO WILL NOT  LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GROW ONE. [ GROWLING ]

 [ LAUGHING ] [ GROWLING ] OH, SNARL AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE, WOLF BOY. IT WON'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... GET AWAY FROM HIM. THAT'S BETTER -- AT LEAST NOW  YOU'RE PICKING ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE. [ GROWLING ]  IT'S ALL RIGHT. [ GROWLING ]  IT'S ALL RIGHT. I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. [ GROWLING ]  SHH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. I WON'T HURT YOU. WILL YOU SHOW ME? LET ME SEE. I HAVE A FRIEND  WHO CAN FIX THIS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID. HERE! COME ON. WHAT? NO PELTS? AFTER ALL THAT COMMOTION, THE MIGHTY HUNTER RETURNS YOU SHOULD HAVE HEEDED  MY WISHES, MILOS, AND SPENT THE DAY TRAINING  TO HUNT NORDS INSTEAD IT WOULD HAVE SAVED YOU  A LOT OF DISAPPOINTMENT. MY PREY HAD SOME HELP. -NOW, WHO DID THIS?  -A MAN WITH A WHITE STAFF. HE ATTACKED US OVER THERE  ON THE RIDGE. THE BEASTMASTER. NOW...WHY DID HE ATTACK ME? HE SEES HIMSELF  AS A GUARDIAN OF THE ANIMALS. TAKES A DIM VIEW -OF HUNTING.  -IT'S MY RIGHT TO HUNT. A MAN'S RIGHTS EXTEND ONLY  AS FAR AS HIS TALENT TO EXERCISE THEM. WE HAVE TOO FEW OF THESE SPECIAL WEAPONS OF YOURS  TO LOSE THEM HUNTING. THEY ARE OUR WEAPONS, AND WE WILL DO WITH THEM AS WE PLEASE. AND MARK MY WORDS... THE BEASTMASTER'S ANIMALS  WILL NEED ANOTHER PROTECTOR AFTER OUR NEXT MEETING. HE SEEMED MORE INTERESTED  IN THE BOY THAN THE WOLVES. WHAT BOY? A BOY WAS TRAVELLING  WITH THE WOLF PACK. AND WHERE IS THIS  WOLF-BOY NOW? THE, UH, BEASTMASTER TOOK HIM. [ GRUNTING ]  DON'T WORRY -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU -- I  BROUGHT YOU WATER. THANK YOU. YOU THINK HE UNDERSTANDS US? IF NOT OUR WORDS,  OUR INTENTIONS. YOU CAN'T  COMMUNICATE? HE LIVES WITH ANIMALS,  BUT HE'S A BOY. [ GRUNTING ]  I'M SORRY, I KNOW THIS HURTS. BUT THIS WILL HELP. NOW THERE'S SO MUCH  I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT HIM... LIKE WHO HE IS AND HOW HE CAME LET'S JUST CONCENTRATE ON  GETTING HIM BETTER NOW. OH, YEAH. HE'S LUCKY.  THERE'S NO BROKEN BONES. OTHERWISE, HE'S QUITE HEALTHY. VERY HARD TO TELL  UNDER THIS DIRT, THOUGH. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE  YOU'VE HAD A BATH, HASN'T IT? HEY, WHAT'S THIS? TATTOO? NO, IT'S A BIRTHMARK. I'LL FINISH UP HERE, AND THEN  WE'LL SEE HOW HUNGRY YOU ARE. I FEEL LIKE I'VE JUST  BECOME SOMEBODY'S FATHER. YOU DON'T LIKE ME A LOT, DO YOU? WELL, WE'RE NOT HERE TO LIKE  EACH OTHER, ARE WE? HMFF. WHATEVER OUR  PERSONAL DIFFERENCES, WE'RE UNITED IN A COMMON CAUSE. YES, WE ARE. AND I CAN TAKE CARE OF MILOS. BUT YOU SHOULD  KEEP AN EYE I SEE HE IS USED TO GIVING ORDERS, NOT TAKING THEM, BUT I'VE DEALT  WITH HIS KIND BEFORE. NORMALLY I WOULDN'T PUT UP  WITH SUCH INSUBORDINATION BUT YOUR TRIBE CARRIES WEAPONS THAT THE NORDS DON'T EVEN HAVE. IT MAY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE  IN THE FINAL BATTLE. AND I NEED MORE  OF THESE, NOT LESS. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS? NO, I DON'T. THE MECHANISM  IS SIMPLE, BUT ANY OF US WHO KNEW THE CRAFT  ARE NOW SLAVES TO THE NORDS. WILL THEY GIVE  VODEN THIS SECRET? NO SLAVE BUILDS  HIS MASTER STRONGER CHAINS. HMM... THANK YOU FOR YOUR COUNSEL. AS A KING, I KNOW HOW HARD  IT IS TO FIND THE RIGHT PERSON TO CONFIDE IN, HUNA. YOU MUST FIND THE SAME THING  IN YOUR SITUATION. WHAT SITUATION IS THAT? LIVING HERE, ALONE,  WITH A BUNCH OF NEANDERTHALS. I CAN TAKE CARE  OF MYSELF. YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, HUNA. I'M A POWERFUL MAN. I'M SURE THERE'S PLENTY  WE CAN OFFER EACH OTHER. A MAN HAS NEEDS, HUNA. THE PROSPECT OF SHARING MY BED  WITH A WOMAN OF MORE OR LESS EQUAL STATUS INTRIGUES ME. I AM IN NO MORE NEED OF A LOVER  THAN I AM OF PROTECTION. BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN. MY TENT IS ALWAYS OPEN. [ GRUNTING ]  NO, NO, YOU HAVE TO EAT. NOURISHMENT IS AN IMPORTANT PART  OF THE HEALING PROCESS. I...I DON'T SEEM  TO BE HAVING MUCH LUCK HERE. YOU HAVEN'T OFFERED  THE RIGHT FOOD. MEAT, OF COURSE. HE'S A WOLF. WHEN DID YOU START HUNTING? RUH AGREED TO SHARE  SOME OF HIS MEAL. AFTER HIS EXPERIENCE, I WOULDN'T  EXPECT HIM TO TRUST HUMANS. I WONDER WHAT HE THINKS  WE'LL DO WITH HIM. WHAT WILL WE DO WITH HIM? FIND HIS FAMILY, HIS WOLF FAMILY.  THEY'LL BE WORRIED. -REALLY? WOLVES' FAMILIES ARE CLOSER-KNIT THAN MOST HUMANS --  THEY'LL BE ANXIOUS ABOUT HIM. WILL THEY EXPLAIN  ABOUT HIS HUMAN FAMILY? IF THEY KNOW. WILL THOSE HUNTERS BE OUT THERE? DON'T WORRY. RUH'S CLOSE NEARBY. BUT JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT ANYWAY. SO YOU'LL BE BACK BY NIGHTFALL? I HOPE SO. ME TOO. [ BURPING ] I WILL NOT BE HUMILIATED  BY THAT HAIRLESS, STRUTTING JACKASS AGAIN. THEY WANT SOMEONE TO LEAD THEM  AGAINST KING VODEN. THAT'S AS FAR  AS THEIR LOYALTY GOES. KEEP AN EYE ON HER. TOMORROW, WE GO  AND HUNT FOR THE BOY AGAIN. WHAT ABOUT  THE BEASTMASTER? HIS HEAD CAN DECORATE  THE POLE NEXT TO THE ONE I'VE RESERVED FOR KING ZAD. IF THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO,  THE NORDS WILL ROLL YOUR HEADS IN THE MUD. LIKE THAT. NOW GO AWAY AND PRACTISE. YOUR LIVES WILL DEPEND ON IT. [ ARGUING ] I TOLD YOU. I'M NOT GIVING  YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNIY. UH! AHH! SUCH ANGER CAN ONLY COME  FROM A LOVER'S PASSION. WHAT? I'D MATE WITH THE DEVIL FIRST. THEN I DO HAVE  A CHANCE WITH YOU. TRY ANYTHING  AND I WILL KILL YOU. YOU'VE GOT FIRE, HUNA. BUT I GET NERVOUS. I DON'T KNOW  WHAT YOU WOULD BURN. IT'S NOT YOUR CONCERN. I'M ABOUT TO ATTACK THE MOST  DISCIPLINED ARMY IN THE WORLD. AND I'M NOT GOING TO  RISK FAILURE BECAUSE OF SOME  PRIVATE FEUD IN THE RANKS. AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME, WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN  YOU AND MILOS BEFORE IT COSTS ME MORE WARRIORS OR MORE WEAPONS. WHY DON'T YOU ASK HIM? BECAUSE I'M ASKING YOU. MILOS AND I BELONG  TO THE SAME TRIBE. DISAGREEMENT AROSE  BETWEEN HIM AND OUR CHIEF. THE ELDERS VOTED AGAINST MILOS. HE WOULDN'T HONOUR THE DECISION. GO ON. HE ATTACKED HIS OWN PEOPLE. HE KILLED MANY OF OUR WARRIORS. AND HE KILLED OUR CHIEF. I HADN'T SEEN HIM AGAIN SINCE  THEN, UNTIL I CAME HERE. AND OBVIOUSLY  I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN. SO MILOS CONSIDERS HIMSELF THE RIGHTFUL LEADER OF YOUR PEOPLE. BUT YOU DON'T? LOOK, THE NORDS  ARE THE GREATER ENEMY NOW, AND  I'M NOT GOING TO LET ANYTHING BETWEEN  US INTERFERE WITH YOUR  BATTLE PLANS. HMM. BESIDES... MILOS IS NEVER ALONE. [ GRUNTING ] [ WOLVES HOWLING ] [ MOANING AND GRUNTING ] [ SNARLING ] [ TWIG SNAPPING ]  [ GASPING ] IT'S ALL RIGHT, DON'T BE AFRAID. SLEEP. [ GROWLING ] [ GASPING ] IT'S OK, IT'S PROBABLY  JUST A...SOMETHING. [ GROWLING ] [ HOWLING ] [ GROWLING ] NO, DON'T, DON'T... [ HOWLING ] [ HOWLING ] [ HOWLING ] NO, DON'T GO. YOUR... YOUR ANKLE. COME ON! [ YELLING ] LOOK FOR THE BOY. I WILL FIND YOU, SWEET HEART. FOLLOW ME! SO YOU FOUND THE REST  OF THE WOLF PACK? YEAH. BUT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN  THE MOTHER WOLF WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED  MY TRACKS HERE. I TRIED TO STOP HER FROM GOING-- IT DOESN'T MATTER. THERE'S NOTHING YOU  COULD HAVE DONE TO STOP THEM FROM GOING. I MEAN, SOMEWHERE OUT THERE  IS A FAMILY LOOKING FOR HIM. THE WOLVES ARE HIS FAMILY,  SO AT LEAST WE KNOW HE'S SAFE. SO COULD THE OTHER WOLVES  TELL YOU ANYTHING? BUT WE KNOW HE JOINED THE PACK  WITH THE SHE-WOLF. PERHAPS SHE'LL KNOW  WHERE HE CAME FROM. YOU HAVE TO FIND HER FIRST. WE'LL GO AFTER THEM  IN THE MORNING. TRACKS WILL BE EASIER  TO FOLLOW IN DAYLIGHT. NOT ONLY FOR US. THOSE HUNTERS  MAY STILL BE OUT THERE. I KNOW. WHAT WERE YOU  GOING TO DO, KANDOR? SHOOT ME IN THE BACK? MILOS WARNED YOU  NOT TO TRY THIS. AND I TOLD HIM  WE'D NEVER GET A SECOND CHANCE  TO KILL THE BOY. THIS IS A VERY CLEVER WOLF. SHE KEEPS DOUBLING BACK  TO CONFUSE ANYONE WHO MIGHT BE FOLLOWING HER. IS SHE TAKING  HIM TO THE PACK? NO. WHY NOT? SO SHE WON'T ENDANGER THE REST  OF THE PACK BY REJOINING THEM. WHERE IS SHE  TAKING HIM? WHEREVER IT IS,  WE'RE GETTING CLOSE. THE WITCH. IT LOOKS LIKE THE ASSASSIN  GOT HIMSELF ASSASSINATED. OR WAS POOR KHANDOR MERELY SUPPOSED  TO FOLLOW HER. I PROMISE YOU,  SHE'LL PAY FOR THIS. BY THE TIME SUN SETS,  YOU SHALL HAVE HER HEAD LAYING AT YOUR FEET,  HERS AND THE BOYS. WILL SOMEONE PLEASE  TELL ME WHY YOU'RE SO OBSESSED WITH  THIS FERAL CHILD? THAT IS BETWEEN US. LET'S GO. GOOD LUCK. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO NEED IT. HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR HIM  TO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM ANIMAL BACK TO HUMAN? DAR, EVEN WITH YOUR ABILITY TO  COMMUNICATE WITH ANIMALS, EVEN YOU MUST PREFER WALKING  UPRIGHT THAN ON ALL FOURS. WOLVES TAUGHT HIM DIFFERENT  VALUES AND WAYS OF THINKING? YEAH, THEIR WAY, NOT OURS. -HE'S NOT ONE OF THEM.  -HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT. TAO... LOOK, THIS IS WHERE  THEY LEFT THE TRAIL. -WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED.  -WHERE? DON'T TURN AROUND. DAR, WHO IS IT?  IS IT THE HUNTERS? YEAH, AND SOMEONE  ELSE BEING HUNTED. LET'S JUST KEEP MOVING. AFTER HER. THERE, BY THE RIVER. WHO IS SHE? SOMEONE WHO NEEDS OUR HELP. OUR FIRST CATCH OF THE DAY. YOU MUST BE SICK OF SEEING ME. NO! YOU'RE SAFE NOW. I WON'T BE SAFE UNTIL HE'S DEAD. THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. WHY ARE YOU FOLLOWING US? I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'VE  DONE WITH ATTICUS. -WHO IS ATTICUS?  -THE BOY WITH THE WOLF. YOU KNOW ABOUT HIM? I THINK HE'S MY SON. SO WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE? IS HE HEALTHY, IS HE STRONG? APART FROM THE LEG, HE'S FINE. THANK YOU FOR HELPING HIM. I DID WHAT I COULD --  HE SHOULD HAVE STAYED OFF -THE LEG AND RESTED BUT--  -WHAT? WELL, I COULDN'T  STOP HIM FROM GOING. WHAT? HE'S NOT WITH YOU? A SHE-WOLF CAME AND TOOK HIM. THEY WERE LIKE MOTHER AND SON. HUNA...DO YOU REMEMBER  ANYTHING ABOUT YOUR SON THAT MIGHT PROVE HE'S YOURS? YOU WANT PROOF? IT'S JUST THAT YOU COME  FROM THE SAME TRIBE AS THE MEN WHO HUNT HIM. I WANT TO ENSURE  YOU WON'T HARM HIM. DOES HE HAVE  A BIRTHMARK...LIKE THIS? YES, HE DOES. THANK YOU. ANOTHER UNSUCCESSFUL  HUNT, MILOS. YOU MUST BE GETTING  VERY TIRED OF THIS. I KNOW I AM. AND WHERE IS HUNA? WITH THE BEASTMASTER. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. IN HIS CHARACTER --  HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN KILLING. I'M SURE IF HE  HADN'T BEEN THERE, HUNA WOULD HAVE PUT  YOU ALL TO THE SWORD. IF HE HADN'T  BEEN THERE, I'D NOW BE  CARRYING HER HEAD. THEN AT LEAST YOU'D HAVE ONE. NO MAN TALKS TO ME LIKE THAT. THIS MAN DOES. I CAME TO YOU TO FIGHT  THE NORDS, ZAD, NOT TO BECOME YOUR SLAVE. UNLESS YOUR EVERY FIBRE IS DEDICATED TO CRUSHING VODEN, YOU'RE OF  NO USE TO ME. I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS. NEITHER DO I! NO STOMACH FOR FIGHT, UH? OR DO YOU ONLY FIGHT WOMEN? AND BOYS. AND EVEN THEN YOU COME SECOND. UNLESS YOU TELL ME  WHAT'S GOING ON, I'LL FINISH HUNA'S JOB FOR HER. MILOS AND HIS MEN LEFT. I WENT BACK FOR ATTICUS,  BUT HE WAS GONE. ALL THAT WAS LEFT  WERE WOLF TRACKS. SO YOU THOUGHT THEY  HAD KILLED YOUR SON. BACK THEN I KNEW  LITTLE OF WOLVES. THOUGHT OF THEM AS VICIOUS  AND HEARTLESS KILLERS. I SOON HEARD THAT WOLVES  HAD BEEN SEEN WITH A BABY. AND THEN OF A BOY  WHO WAS RUNNING WITH THEM. I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE  IT WAS POSSIBLE. BUT I STILL HOPED  THAT IT WAS HIM. SO WHY DO THE  OTHERS HUNT HIM? HE'S THE RIGHTFUL HEIR  TO LEAD OUR TRIBE. MILOS WOULD CLAIM HIS PLACE. SO HE'S BEEN SEARCHING AS HARD  AS I HAVE TO FIND ATTICUS. TO KILL HIM. MY HUSBAND WAS OUR LEADER. MILOS KILLED HIM AND WOULD STOP  AT NOTHING TO KILL OUR SON. THAT IS WHY I WANTED HIM DEAD. ONE KILLING WILL ALWAYS  LEAD TO ANOTHER. WE JUST HAVE TO FIND  YOUR SON BEFORE HE DOES. MY PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE ONLY ONE LEADER. WHILE THE BOY IS STILL ALIVE,  NO ONE ELSE CAN BE OUR CHIEF. WHAT GOOD IS  A CROWN IF YOU HAVE NO PEOPLE  TO RULE? MY PEOPLE ARE NOT DESTROYED.  THEY'RE ENSLAVED. ONCE WE DEFEAT VODEN, AND WITH THESE... WE'LL BE GREAT ONCE AGAIN. SO, NO SIGN OF THE SHE-WOLF  AND ATTICUS? NO, THEY MUST HAVE  GONE TO GROUND. WHERE WOULD THEY HIDE  IN THE RAVINE? THERE'S A LOT OF CAVES NEARBY. IF THEY'VE GONE INSIDE,  SHARAK WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE THEM -- COME. MORE LIKE IT. WE'LL MAKE QUITE AN OUTFIT  WHEN WE POOL OUR RESOURCES. A SIGN OF THINGS TO COME. I'VE NEVER NEEDED AN ARMY  TO KILL WOLVES BEFORE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT KILLING. I WANT THAT WOLF BOY ALIVE. -I WANT HIM DEAD.  -AND HE WILL BE SOON ENOUGH -- LET'S NOT  LOSE SIGHT OF THE REASON WE CAME TOGETHER IN THE FIRST  PLACE -- TO DEFEAT THE NORDS. TRUST ME ON THIS, MILOS. I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. TO FREE YOUR PEOPLE,  WE NEED MORE CROSSBOWS. MORE BOWS MEAN CRAFTSMEN, PEOPLE THAT CAN FIGURE THEM OUT AND BUILD NEW ONES. A LIVE BOY CAN PURCHASE  THESE SERVICES? [ CHUCKLING ] OH, YES. BEASTMASTER'S BRIGHT FRIEND, TAO, CAN DO THIS FOR US. HE CAN UNRAVEL THE WORKINGS  OF ANYTHING. BUT WE NEED A BARGAINING CHIP  TO KEEP THE BEASTMASTER AT BAY TILL WE HAVE WHAT WE NEED. THEN I GET TO KILL  THE BOY AND HIS MOTHER. OH, CERTAINLY YOU  GET TO KILL THE BOY. LEAVE HIS MOTHER TO ME. HOPEFULLY YOUR  QUEST'S SOON OVER. I'M IMAGINING  WHAT HE'LL LOOK LIKE. HIS BABY FACE IS  BURNED INTO MY MIND, HE DOESN'T LOOK  LIKE THAT NOW, RIGHT? I'M SURE THERE WILL  BE A RESEMBLANCE... EVEN IF HE DOESN'T  WASH BEHIND HIS EARS. LET ME GO AHEAD. YOU TWO STAY HERE. WE'LL SEARCH FASTER TOGETHER. WE DON'T WANT TO FRIGHTEN THEM. IT WOULD BE BETTER  IF I GO IN ALONE. I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU. UP THIS WAY. ARE YOU SURE THE BOY  WILL STILL BE WITH THEM? IF THE BOY'S HURT,  HE'LL BE WITH THE BEASTMASTER. THE BEASTMASTER  WILL BE WITH TAO. THE ONE WE WANT. HUNA. THEY'RE HERE.  DID YOU SEE HIM? NOT YET. COME.  TRY NOT TO MAKE ANY NOISE. WAIT HERE. WHAT'S HAPPENING? I TOLD HER WHO YOU ARE. NOW SHE'S DECIDING  IF SHE CAN TRUST YOU. THERE'S ONE THING  I DON'T UNDERSTAND. ONLY ONE? WE JUST APPEAR OUT OF NOWHERE, WON'T THE BEASTMASTER  HIDE THE BOY? LET ME DO THE  THINKING, MILOS. IF YOU HAVE A PLAN,  I SHOULD KNOW. WE'LL DO THIS MY WAY.  NOW, SEARCH THE TRAIL. IT'S HIM. [ GRUNTING ]  [ GROWLING ] NO, NO...DON'T RUSH THEM. IT'S AS CONFUSING  FOR THEM AS IT IS FOR YOU. NOW. MY BABY. LOOK. I'VE GOT A MARK JUST LIKE YOURS. SEE? YEAH. COME HERE, BABY.  [ GRUNTING ] IT'S OK. IT'S OK. [ SNIFFING ] COME HERE. WHAT'S THE SHE-WOLF FEELING? SHE'S SAD, BUT SHE THINKS  WHAT SHE'S DONE IS RIGHT. KING ZAD. THERE'S NO TRAIL. ONE OF THE MEN SAW  THE WOLVES OVER THERE. OK. WHAT NOW? WHERE DID YOU FIRST FIND  THIS PACK OF WOLVES? OVER THERE ON THAT RIDGE. WE'LL TRY THERE. TAKE YOUR MEN  AND SEARCH THE RIDGE. AND JUST WHAT ARE  YOU GOING TO DO? WE'LL BE RIGHT BEHIND YOU, READY TO STOP ANYTHING  THAT GETS PASSED. I THOUGHT YOU'D APPRECIATE  HAVING FIRST CRACK AT THEM. LET'S GET MOVING. WE SHOULD MOVE. THIS ISN'T  A GOOD PLACE TO GET CAUGHT. OK.  [ CAWING ] IT'S MILOS.  HE'S COMING THIS WAY. MAYBE WE CAN  DISTRACT HIM. WE'LL DRAW THEM AWAY --  STAY IN THE CAVE WITH YOUR SON AND THE WOLF --  WE'LL RETURN WHEN IT'S SAFE. SOMEONE'S GOT TO STAY  WHO CAN FIGHT... IF IT COMES TO THAT. ALL RIGHT. COME. I CAN'T SEE ZAD WITH THEM. THIS MILOS MUST BE  A REAL GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT. THEN LET'S  GIVE HIM SOME. [ WHISTLING ] QUICK, BEFORE THEY  CAN HIDE THE BOY. SHALL WE HELP THEM? YOU HAVE TO LOVE A MAN WHO GETS IT SO WRONG SO OFTEN... AND SO PREDICTABLY. FOLLOW ME. GO. COME ON, HURRY. AHHH. YEAH. WHERE THE HELL IS ZAD? THAT'S A GOOD  QUESTION. DAR. WE MUST RETURN. IT'S A TRAP. CONGRATULATIONS. YOU FOUND YOUR SON. WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MILOS?  I SAID HE WAS UNTRUSTWORTHY. HE HASN'T BEEN. -CAN I SEE THE LITTLE FELLOW?  -WHY? NEITHER OF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME, HUNA. I CAME HERE MERELY TO NEGOTIATE WITH...AH! THE MAN HIMSELF. BEASTMASTER, HOW  VERY NICE TO SEE YOU. WHAT DO YOU WANT, ZAD? A SIMPLE DISCUSSION  OF ALTERNATIVES BETWEEN TWO CIVILIZED MEN, ONE OF WHOM HAS SLAUGHTERED CHILDREN BEFORE AND WOULD HAVE  NO QUALMS ABOUT DOING SO AGAIN. YOU WILL NOT TOUCH MY CHILD. THIS ISN'T PERSONAL, HUNA. IT JUST SEEMED THE OBVIOUS WAY OF GETTING YOUR NEW FRIEND HERE TO LISTEN TO MY PROPOSITION. WELL, I'M LISTENING. ARE YOU SURE THEY WENT THIS WAY? MM-HMM. WHY DIDN'T ZAD CUT THEM OFF? IT'S A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION, BEASTMASTER. MY ARMY NEED MORE OF THESE. YOUR BRIGHT, YOUNG FRIEND CAN SHOW US HOW TO BUILD THEM. WHY WOULD I HELP YOU...  DRIVE OUT THE NORDS? BECAUSE IT'S A NOBLE CAUSE. -PUTTING YOU BACK IN POWER.  -THAT WOULD BE A VERY WELCOME BY-PRODUCT, YES. I WON'T DO IT. YOU'RE FOND OF  THAT PEACOCK, VODEN. I PREFER HIM TO YOU. TOO BAD. BECAUSE IF HE DOESN'T DO  WHAT I WANT, THE BOY DIES, -DIES NOW, BEFORE HER EYES.  -NO! DON'T TRY TO PUT UP  A FIGHT, BEASTMASTER. ONE OF US WILL GET TO THE BOY BEFORE YOU DO. IF TAO DOES WHAT YOU WANT? THE BOY STAYS WITH ME  UNTIL VODEN'S DEFEATED. THEN SHE CAN HAVE HIM BACK. THANK YOU, MILOS. THAT WAS A VERY  USEFUL DIVERSION. YOU COULD  HAVE TOLD ME. AND RISK YOU MAKING  A MESS OF IT ALL? WHERE'S THE BOY? IN THERE, I SUSPECT. BUT NOBODY SEEMS TO KEEN  ABOUT GETTING HIM OUT. I'LL BE VERY HAPPY TO OBLIGE. NO! WAIT. [ GROWLING ] GO! KILL THE BEASTMASTER. I WANT THE WOMAN AND TAO ALIVE. GET UP. OHHH, RETREAT,  GET AWAY FROM HERE. [ SHRIEKING ] WELL, THIS IS  WHERE WE PART COMPANY. WHAT'S SHE SAYING? SHE'S TELLING HIM TO GO,  BUT SHE'S ASKING THAT -HE NEVER FORGETS HER.  -HE WON'T FORGET HER. I'LL MAKE SURE OF THAT. AND I'LL NEVER FORGET  WHAT YOU'VE BOTH DONE. YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. SHE KNOWS HE'S GOING  WHERE HE BELONGS. DID HE MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE? I MEAN, DID WE DO  THE RIGHT THING BY RETURNING THE BOY TO THE WORLD OF MAN? EVERYONE HAS A PLACE IN THE WORLD, TAO. WHERE HE'S GOING  WILL BE VERY DIFFERENT, BUT  AS LONG AS HE RECEIVES AS MUCH  LOVE THERE AS HE DID HERE, HE'LL  BE ALL RIGHT. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
