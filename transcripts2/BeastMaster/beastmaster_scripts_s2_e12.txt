  THERE'S NO MESSAGE  SCROLL HERE, EITHER. IT'S LIKE THE EIRONS  HAVE ALL DISAPPEARED. MAYBE THEY'VE CHANGED  THEIR MESSAGE DROP-OFFS. NO...THIS SILENCE IS DISTURBING. EIRONS DON'T LIKE SILENCE. -WE LIKE TO KEEP IN TOUCH.  -YOU MEAN YOU LIKE TO TALK. DAR, THIS IS SERIOUS. IF THE EIRONS WANT TO DRIVE WE NEED TO EACH KNOW WHAT  THE OTHER IS DOING. I'VE HEARD OF A NEW LEADER  IS PLANNING AN ATTACK AGAINST THE BROTHERHOOD  AND NOW NOTHING--

 PERHAPS HE DOESN'T WANT  TO RISK GIVING AWAY HIS PLANS. HE CAN'T DO THIS ALONE. HE NEEDS  THE HELP OF EIRONS LIKE ME. IF HE TRULY IS A LEADER,  DON'T YOU THINK HE'D BE WISE ENOUGH  TO KNOW THAT? HA...THERE'S A MESSAGE  DROP NEAR THE GATES OF XINCA. LET'S GO HAVE A LOOK. MALOC? WHERE'S THE GIRL,  YOUR DAUGHTER? WE DON'T KNOW.  SHE RAN AWAY. WE WERE GOING  TO TELL YOU BUT... COME ON!  [ SCREAMING ]  STAND UP! YOU KNOW THE PRICE OF DISOBEDIENCE. NO! PLEASE, SHE MEANS NO HARM.

 NO! HELP! -LET HER GO!  -WAIT! IT'S NOT EVERY DAY I MEET  SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS OPENLY. SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T  KNOW ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID. ARE THERE OTHERS LIKE YOU? MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. REALLY? AND WHERE ARE THEY? IN THE MARKETPLACE,  IN THE MOUNTAINS? DON'T TRY MY PATIENCE. I'M READY TO TRY MORE THAN THAT. UGH, NOTHING. AND THERE'S ALWAYS  MESSAGES HERE. SOMETHING IS DEFINITELY WRONG. YOU'RE RIGHT, LISTEN. THERE'S NO BIRDS. THERE'S NO ANIMALS IN THE TREES. I'M TALKING  ABOUT THE MESSAGE DROP. SOMETHING'S FRIGHTENED  OR DRIVEN THEM AWAY. YOU'RE SAYING THE ANIMALS  HAVE DISAPPEARED TOO? YEAH. [ CAWING ] WHAT IS IT? IT'S MALOC AND THE BROTHERHOOD. SOMEONE'S CHALLENGING  THEM FOR POWER. WHO? LET'S FIND OUT. -IT'S DANGEROUS IN XINCA.  -IT'S MY FIGHT. THEN LET'S NOT LOSE YOU  IN THE FIRST BATTLE. I'VE NEVER  SEEN YOU BEFORE. WHAT MAKES  THIS YOUR FIGHT? ARE YOU AN EIRON? WHAT I AM DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT MATTERS IS THAT YOUR REIGN  OF TERROR IS ABOUT TO END. THERE ARE BRAVE MEN AMONG YOU,  WHO'D FIGHT THIS EVIL. OUR TIME IS HERE. OUR TIME IS NOW! [ YELLING AND SHOUTING ] BRING THE OTHERS! ARGH! GET OUT OF HERE! NO, THIS IS MY FIGHT! YOU'LL LOSE IT  IF YOU DON'T GO NOW! WELCOME, EIRON. YOU'VE COME BACK TO DIE. IN AN AGE WHEN NATURE  AND MAGIC RULE THE WORLD... THERE IS  AN EXTRAORDINARY LEGEND: THE STORY OF A WARRIOR WHO COMMUNICATES WITH ANIMALS, WHO FIGHTS SORCERY  AND THE UNNATURAL. HIS NAME IS DAR,  LAST OF HIS TRIBE. HE'S ALSO CALLED... MALOC! TAO! NO! IT'S OVER! WE'RE LEAVING! NO! -WE'RE GOING!  -NO! WE'RE GOING! WHERE'S THE ONE  WHO CHALLENGED MALOC? THEY'RE GONE, JUST  LIKE US. NOW MOVE. -I KNOW I'M BEING STUPID...  -I SAID IMPULSIVE. BUT YOU MEANT STUPID. AND YOU'RE RIGHT. WHEN I SAW MALOC  ALL I FELT WAS ANGER. IT'S KNOWN THAT MY FAMILY  HAVE QUICK TEMPERS. I THOUGHT I HAD IT  UNDER CONTROL. YOU CAN'T FIGHT IN ANGER,  NO MATTER HOW JUST YOUR CAUSE. YOU HAVE TO DEFEAT THEM;  NOT BECOME LIKE THEM. IT LOOKS EASY. WHEN YOU FINISH  THEM OFF, THE PROBLEM'S GONE. IF IT WAS, ANYONE COULD DO IT. EVIL CAN'T BE DEFEATED  WITH HATRED OR REVENGE. THE MAN YOU HELPED, WHY  WAS HE CONFRONTING MALOC? I REALLY DIDN'T HAVE  TIME TO ASK HIM. MAYBE IT'S STARTED.  MAYBE HE'S THE SPARK. MAYBE -- BUT HIS PLAN WON'T  GO FAR IF HE TAKES ON THE PRIESTS SINGLE-HANDED. AH, MAYBE HE'S BEING  IMPULSIVE, TOO. -OVER THERE!  -THIS ROAD LOOKS LIKE IT COULD  LAST FOREVER. THIS IS WHAT'S DRIVEN  THE ANIMALS AWAY. WHAT'S THE MATTER  WITH THAT POSSUM? HE SAYS THAT THE ANIMALS  HERE ARE NO LONGER SAFE AND PEOPLE USING THIS ROAD  ARE HUNTING THEM FOR FOOD AND CUTTING THEIR HOMES  FOR FIREWOOD. GET GOING! DAR, THE ROAD ISN'T THAT BIG. IT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE. HEY... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? THIS ROAD IS CAUSING TROUBLE. TROUBLE FOR WHO? THE ANIMALS WHO LIVE HERE. YOU'RE THAT BEASTMASTER,  AREN'T YOU? -YES.  -KING VODEN TOLD ME ABOUT YOU. HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU MUCH. I THINK YOU'D BETTER GET  OUT OF HERE. THIS IS VODEN'S IDEA? GET LOST. I PROMISED HIM WE'D  BUILD A HUNDRED PACES A DAY. A HUNDRED PACES? YOU'RE CUTTING  HUNDREDS OF TREES EVERY DAY. THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF TREES. YOU COULD BUILD HOMES FOR  ALL YOUR POOR ANIMALS. AND ONE FOR YOU AND  YOUR LITTLE FRIEND, TOO. HEE-YA! [ SCREAMING ] WOULDN'T NEED TO WHIP THEM  IF THE LOAD WAS LIGHTER. THE SAME GOES FOR THE BULLOCKS. THIS IS VODEN'S  ROAD, BEASTMASTER. NEITHER YOU, NOR ANY HOMELESS  ANIMAL IS GOING TO STOP ME. AND ARINA IS MAKING SURE ANYONE WHO GETS  IN ITS WAY DOESN'T LIVE LONG. YOU MAKE SURE YOU  REMEMBER WHAT I SAID. NOBODY JUST DISAPPEARS! LOOK AGAIN! FIND OUT WHO HE IS. FIND OUT WHO HELPS HIM...  BESIDES THE BEASTMASTER AND HIS EIRON FRIEND. IF THERE'S A REBELLION, WE WILL SMOTHER THE FIRE  BEFORE IT BEGINS. BRING HIM TO ME ALIVE! WHERE'S VODEN? DOING WHAT HE DOES BEST. CONQUERING A LITTLE  MORE OF THE WORLD. AND HE PUT  YOU IN CHARGE OF THE ROAD. IT'S IN THE WRONG PLACE.  PUT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. HA, THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT. IT'S PART OF HIS NEW VISION. WHAT VISION? HE'S BUILDING MANY ROADS, EXTENDING TO THE FOUR  CORNERS OF THE WORLD. AND THEN BUILDING MORE  ROADS IN BETWEEN. CONNECTING LIKE A SPIDERWEB. ALL ROADS LEAD TO XINCA. THIS'LL CHANGE THE FACE  OF THE WORLD. YES, THE WORLD IS CHANGING, DAR. LIKE IT OR NOT, MEN LIKE  VODEN HELP SHAPE ITS DESTINY. LEARN TO LIVE WITH IT, LIKE US. WELL, I DON'T THINK I CAN. THESE ROADS ARE DIFFERENT. YOU'RE RIGHT. THEY WON'T  WASH AWAY WITH EVERY STORM, THEY WON'T SINK  UNDER HEAVY LOADS. AND THEY'LL DESTROY EVERY  LIVING THING IN THEIR PATH. A LOT OF THINGS  MEN BUILD DO THAT. [ SIGHING ] MORE ROADS WILL  MEAN MORE PEOPLE. AND XINCA WILL GROW. I THINK THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA. THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU  CAN DO ABOUT IT, DAR, UNLESS YOU'RE GOING  TO TEAR IT ALL DOWN AND LET THE FOREST  TAKE OVER AGAIN. AT LEAST THE  FOREST TAKES CARE OF ITS OWN. SEARCH EVERY ROOM. MAKE SURE THERE'S  NOWHERE HE CAN HIDE. ARGH! OPEN UP! OPEN UP! IT'S DRIVING ME INSANE NOT  KNOWING WHO STOOD UP TO MALOC, AND WHERE THE EIRONS ARE. I'M SORRY. I ONLY FOUND OUT  WHAT I COULD. [ SIGHING ] YOU KNOW THIS ROAD  IS AS BAD FOR XINCA AS IT IS FOR  THE ANIMALS. I THOUGHT IT WAS  THE SORT OF THING THAT CIVILIZED PEOPLE  BELIEVED WAS GOOD. WELL, USUALLY IT IS...ONLY  THIS WOULD GIVE VODEN MORE STRENGTH, WEALTH  AND INFLUENCE. AND THAT APPLIES FOR  THE PRIESTS AS WELL. THEY'VE ALREADY CARVED UP  XINCA BETWEEN THEM. THIS ROAD WILL ONLY  GIVE THEM MORE TO STEAL. SO, IF YOUR PEOPLE  ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THE BROTHERHOOD,  THEY BETTER DO IT SOON. IF MY PEOPLE ARE TO DEFEAT THE BROTHERHOOD,  THEY BETTER DO IT NOW. WHAT'S HAPPENED? [ SIGHING ] SOME MEN WORKING  ON THE ROAD HAVE TRIED TO KILL HER FOR FOOD. OH, SHE'S HURT HER LEG  TRYING TO ESCAPE. WE'LL HAVE TO STOP THE BLEEDING. I'LL HAVE TO GATHER SOME HERBS. LET'S FIND A PLACE  TO CAMP FOR THE NIGHT. I'LL BUILD AN ENCLOSURE  SO SHE'S SAFE. [ SIGHING ] LET'S GET TO WORK. THEY LEFT US ALL  THE MATERIAL WE'LL NEED. GO, GO. [ GRUNTING ] THAT SHOULD SLOW  THEM DOWN. GO NOW. TELL THE OTHERS  OUR TIME IS NEAR. I KNOW THAT STINGS A LITTLE. BUT THAT'S A GOOD THING. BY MORNING THIS WILL  FEEL MUCH BETTER. WILL YOU BE ABLE  TO HELP THEM ALL? WHO ARE YOU? A FRIEND. DAR... THIS IS THE SORCERESS  I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT. REMEMBER WHEN I FIXED  YOUR STAFF? I LIED...SHE DID IT. SHE HELPED YOU? YEAH. HOW DO YOU LIKE IT? IT'S, UH, IT HAS A NICE  WEIGHT IN MY HANDS. MOVES WELL... IT'S STRONG. -WHY ARE YOU HERE?  -MY TEACHER, THE ANCIENT ONE  WANTS ME TO OBSERVE HUMAN AFFAIRS FOR A WHILE,  ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT DISTURB THE BALANCE  OF NATURE. YOU'VE DEFINITELY COME  TO THE RIGHT PLACE. THERE'S SO MANY CREATURES  HURTING LIKE THAT DEER. TOO MANY, I THINK. HOW CAN THEY BE HELPED? -THERE ARE HUMANS DOING THAT  -NOW. WHO? ONES LIKE YOU; ONES THAT  WEAR THOSE GREEN RINGS. EIRONS. WE HAVE TO FIND THEM. [ CAWING ] -STAY WITH THE DEER.  -I'M COMING. NO, STAY WITH THE DEER. THE DEER'S YOUR JOB;  THE EIRONS ARE MINE. MAYBE. BUT NOW SHE  NEEDS YOUR HELP MORE. I TRY TO JOIN THE REVOLUTION;  HE KEEPS PROTECTING ME. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S GOOD AT. [ CAWING ] UP AHEAD! STAY WITH HIM NOW! WE'RE GAINING ON HIM. THERE! FOOL ENOUGH TO THINK  THAT YOU COULD ESCAPE ME? OR BEAT ME? YOU'RE ALREADY BEATEN, MALOC. YOU'RE JUST NOT SMART  ENOUGH TO KNOW IT. [ CHUCKLING ] AH, IT'S ALMOST A SHAME  TO KILL YOU. WITH THE COURAGE TO FIGHT  IS A RARE THING. YOU COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF US. I CAN SEE IT  IN YOUR EYES. I COULD NEVER BE LIKE YOU. WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW YOURSELF  AS WELL AS I THOUGHT. WHY DIE FOR A PEOPLE WHO WILL  NEVER APPRECIATE YOU? HMM? THERE'S STILL TIME TO RECANT. JUST A FEW  NAMES, THAT'S ALL. I WOULD RATHER RIP OUT  MY OWN HEART. LEAVE THAT TO ME. BEHIND YOU! LET'S GO! THIS IS ONLY A TASTE  OF WHAT'S COME. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE  BLOOD TO REPAY, MALOC. THIS IS OF NO CONCERN TO YOU, -OR KING VODEN.  -I'M SURE HE DOESN'T CARE WHAT YOU DO TO EACH OTHER. KING VODEN PROMISED THAT  THE EIRONS BELONG TO US. WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO NEED A LITTLE MORE  THAN UNDERSTANDING. YOU KNEW THEY WERE TRACKING YOU, BUT YOU STILL STAYED NEAR XINCA. XINCA IS WHERE  THE BROTHERHOOD HOLDS POWER. IT'S TIME MORE THAN EIRON  BLOOD RAN IN ITS STREETS. IS THAT THE EIRON WAY? WHAT DO YOU KNOW  ABOUT THE EIRON WAY? I KNOW THEY DON'T LIKE  TO SHED BLOOD. I KNOW THEY'RE BEING ORGANIZED  BEHIND A NEW LEADER. IS THAT YOU? AND I'VE HAD MY HANDS FULL  TEACHING THEM TO FIGHT. HOW DO YOU KNOW  SO MUCH ABOUT US? I'VE SPENT SOME TIME  WITH ONE OF YOUR PEOPLE. THEN YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE I FACE TURNING THEM  INTO WARRIORS. IF I HAD A DOZEN MEN LIKE YOU, NEITHER THE PRIESTS NOR VODEN  COULD STAND AGAINST ME. DESTROYING THE PRIESTS WON'T  BE THE HARDEST TASK YOU FACE. NO -- IT WILL  BE RETURNING XINCA TO ITS  FORMER GLORY. AND WHAT ABOUT ITS FORMER PEACE? HA, YOU HAVE SPENT TIME  WITH ONE OF US. MY FRIEND WOULD KNOW YOUR NAME. THAT WOULD NOT BE WISE. BUT THE DAY WILL COME,  AND WHEN IT DOES, I WON'T FORGET  WHO MY FRIENDS ARE. SO WHAT HAPPENED AFTER XINCA? WE TALKED. IS HE AN EIRON? HOW DOES HE LOOK?  HOW DOES HE SOUND? TWO ARMS, TWO LEGS...  A LITTLE GREEN RING. DOESN'T ASK AS MANY QUESTIONS. SO SHOULD I BE  HELPING HIM? HE'S ORGANIZING THE EIRONS  UP IN THE MOUNTAINS. DON'T WORRY. THEY SHOULD BE  IN XINCA SOON. THAT'S WHY ALL THE SILENCE. HE'S READY TO MAKE HIS MOVE. I SHOULD JOIN HIM  AND HELP MY PEOPLE. DID YOU TELL HIM ABOUT ME? OH, HE DIDN'T ASK. [ LAUGHING ] YOU KNOW, DAR, SOMETIMES  YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT ASKING PEOPLE  THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. BUT SHE DOESN'T WANT TO  BE IN THE ENCLOSURE ANYMORE. WELL, SHE CAN'T LEAVE.  SHE'LL OPEN UP THE WOUND. I TOLD HER THAT BUT DEER  DON'T LIKE TO BE CAGED. PLEAD AS MUCH AS YOU  LIKE WITH YOUR BIG BROWN EYES,  BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING. DO YOU THINK SHE UNDERSTOOD ME? SHE DID WHAT YOU ASKED. WHAT? LET'S SEE WHAT YOUR EIRON  FRIEND'S DONE TO VODEN'S ROAD. LOOK AT THIS. I'M ALREADY  BEHIND SCHEDULE. YOU KNOW WHAT VODEN WILL DO  TO ME IF THIS ISN'T READY YOU'LL CATCH UP --  THESE MEN WILL STAND GUARD AND MAKE SURE  IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. THAT'S THEM. THEY'RE THE ONES. THEY WERE HERE YESTERDAY  CAUSING TROUBLE. I TOLD YOU, YOU CAN'T STOP PROGRESS,  BEASTMASTER. HE TOLD ME TO STOP WHIPPING  THE BULLOCKS. IT'S HIM. DROP YOUR WEAPON. DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS. THERE'S NO WAY OUT. I'M NOT MAKING YOU DO ANYTHING. AND YOU KNOW  I'LL FIND A WAY OUT. I HAVE TO TAKE  YOU BACK TO XINCA. VODEN'S MEN WILL PROTECT  YOU FROM THE PRIESTS. THIS ROAD WILL BE FINISHED, DAR. IF IT ISN'T, VODEN WILL GET  RID OF ALL OF US. I CAN'T LET YOU BLOCK THE WAY. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO US IN XINCA? I'LL LET YOU GO AS SOON AS THE ROAD IS FINISHED. AND IF YOU DON'T? I'D NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF. DAR? TAKE THEM AWAY! NOW GET BACK TO WORK. YOU KNOW, IF THE PRIESTS  FIND ME IN HERE... SHE PROMISED  THEY WOULDN'T. I WISH I KNEW  WHAT SIDE SHE WAS ON. TAO, SHE'S A MERCENARY. HER LOYALTY BELONGS  TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER. AND RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE  NOTHING TO OFFER. WHAT'S GOING TO THAT DEER  WHILE WE'RE HERE? IT COULD'VE JUMPED OUT OF THE  ENCLOSURE ANY TIME IT WANTED. IT ONLY STAYED BECAUSE  IT KNEW YOU WERE HELPING. [ FOREMAN ]: VODEN PUT ME  IN CHARGE OF THE ROAD. IF THINGS GO WRONG,  HE'LL TAKE IT OUT ON ME. THEN WHY  COME TO US? YOU KNOW HOW TO MAKE  AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE. YOU'LL SHOW ANYBODY  ELSE WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY STAND IN THE WAY  OF VODEN'S ROAD. YOU JUST MAKE SURE  YOU TELL VODEN WHO HELPED  FIX YOUR PROBLEM. JUST MAKE SURE IT IS FIXED. WHO'S THERE? SHOW YOURSELF! WE NEED TO HURRY. HEY. -HMM...WHA, WHAT?  -SHH. TAO, GET UP. WE MUST GO. TAO? WHO'S THAT? THAT'S THE MAN  YOU WANTED TO MEET. LET'S GO. COME ON. KIM? LITTLE BROTHER? I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL ME THAT. [ LAUGHING ] DIDN'T THINK I'D SEE YOU. I KNEW I'D FIND YOU. COME ON, WE HAVE TO GO. LET'S GO. HEY! THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT. IT'S CLEAR. LET'S GO. MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWED. AFTER THEM! THIS TIME THEY CAN'T GET AWAY. SO, HOW LONG HAS DAR BEEN TAKING  CARE OF MY LITTLE BROTHER? HA, HA, HA, DON'T CALL ME THAT. DAR SAVED MY LIFE  JUST AFTER I LEFT XINCA. WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHEN DID YOU  GET BACK? IT MUST HAVE BEEN  JUST AFTER YOU LEFT. THE PRIESTS WERE TAKING CONTROL. AND MALOC WAS GIVING THEM  A PASSION FOR BLOOD. WHAT ABOUT OUR PARENTS?  DID THEY ESCAPE TO THE FOREST? THEY WERE AMONG  THE FIRST KILLED. I WISH I COULD TELL YOU THAT THEY WENT QUICKLY...THEY DIDN'T. THE NIGHT I BURIED THEM, EVERY ROCK I PLACED  ON THEIR GRAVES FELT LIKE IT CAME FROM  THE HARDNESS OF MY HEART. I WOULD MAKE EVERY ONE OF THEM  FEEL THE SAME PAIN. DAR SAID THAT YOU WERE  ORGANIZING THE EIRONS. IT'LL BE GOOD TO SEE THE EIRONS  IN CONTROL OF XINCA AGAIN. WHEN DO WE START? WE NEED TO GET RID  OF MALOC FIRST. WILL YOU HELP ME? WAS HE ONE THAT KILLED  OUR PARENTS? YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS EMPTY HERE WITHOUT HIM. IT'S QUIETER...BUT STILL EMPTY. YOU CAN GO AND FORAGE. I'LL BE ALL RIGHT. GO. DO YOU LIKE BEING ALONE? I MEAN, WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE  ANOTHER HUMAN TO TALK TO. YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER  THOUGHT ABOUT IT. DO YOU LIKE BEING ALONE? I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT HUMAN. BUT I THINK THAT BEING ALONE MIGHT MAKE HUMANS APPRECIATE  EACH OTHER MORE. IS THAT RIGHT? DO YOU ALWAYS ASK  THIS MANY QUESTIONS? ISN'T THAT SOMETHING  YOU'RE USED TO? [ CHUCKLING ] I'M AFRAID I HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF TIME FOR SELF-ENLIGHTENMENT. BUT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU  CAN REALLY CHANGE THE WORLD. NO, THAT'S HOW  YOU CHANGE YOURSELF. CHANGING THE WORLD  REQUIRES POWER -- THE SAME KIND OF POWER  VODEN AND MALOC WIELD? IT SERVES ITS PURPOSE, TAO. ONCE WE GET CONTROL OF XINCA, ENLIGHTEN THE PEOPLE  AS MUCH AS YOU LIKE. BUT ENLIGHTENMENT ISN'T  SOMETHING YOU CAN TEACH, IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU  HAVE TO LEARN YOURSELF. YOU ALWAYS HAD A WAY OF COMPLICATING THINGS,  LITTLE BROTHER. THAT'S WHY WE MAKE SUCH A GOOD PAIR. SO, WHEN DO WE GO AFTER MALOC? TODAY. WE CAN'T LET THEM  GET ANY STRONGER. IF WE HESITATE, WE LOSE. YEAH, OF COURSE. YOU'VE NEVER KILLED  ANYBODY, HAVE YOU? WILL KILLING  BE NECESSARY? COULD YOU KILL SOMEONE? I DIDN'T THINK SO. MAYBE THIS IS TOO DANGEROUS FOR YOU. SO IS DOING NOTHING. I THOUGHT WE'D ATTACK AT NIGHT. ONE THING THAT ALWAYS  COUNTERS POWER IS SURPRISE. I DIDN'T THINK TAO  WAS A FIGHTER. HE'S NOT. WHAT? IS HE  IN TROUBLE? NOT YET. SOUND THE ALARM! NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE, MALOC. IT ENDS HERE. YOU KILLED MY FATHER. YOU TORE OUT MY MOTHER'S  BEATING HEART. NOW...YOU'LL FEEL  WHAT THEY FELT. NO ONE CAN SAVE YOU, JUST AS NO ONE  COULD SAVE MY FAMILY. WAIT! WE HAVE MUCH GOLD! SHINY STONES  TOO NUMEROUS TO COUNT. WOULD THAT RETURN  WHAT YOU'VE TAKEN! KIM! DON'T. I'LL SHOW YOU ALL  THE MERCY...YOU SHOWED THEM. WE DID IT, LITTLE BROTHER. XINCA IS OURS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, YOU SAVED  OUR VILLAGE. KIM'S A HERO. YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT I'D BE HAPPY  FOR TAO WHEN THIS DAY CAME. BUT NOW...I'M NOT SURE  IF THINGS WILL BE BETTER. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. IN HIS OWN WAY, KIM HAS  THE SAME ARROGANCE AS VODEN. I ALWAYS THOUGHT POWER WAS  SOMETHING TO ASPIRE TO, BUT EACH NEW LEADER I'VE MET  IS MORE VICIOUS THAN THE LAST. I'M NOT SURE THIS ONE'S  GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT. HE HAS TAO TO TEMPER HIM. WAS IT TAO WHO COUNSELLED HIM TO SEND MEN TO HELP  BUILD VODEN'S ROAD? WHAT? DON'T YOU KNOW? HE'S PROMISED US  HUNDREDS OF NEW WORKERS. ANYONE KIM CHOOSES. THANK YOU.  WE'RE LIBERATED. THANK YOU  SO MUCH. IT'S WONDERFUL. WELCOME, DAR. I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO THANK YOU PROPERLY FOR ALL YOUR HELP. IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU WANT --  ANYTHING AT ALL -- STOP BUILDING THE ROAD. HA, DAR, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU. I CAME TO ASK YOUR BROTHER WHY HE'S  BUILDING VODEN'S ROAD. BUILDING THE ROAD? YOU CAN'T STOP PROGRESS. -IT'S BEST FOR EVERYONE.  -NOT THE ANIMALS. THERE ARE ANIMALS EVERYWHERE. NO ONE CAN BUILD  A ROAD AROUND THEM. YOU'RE NOT PLANNING  TO START TROUBLE? I THOUGHT YOU WERE  TRYING TO TEAR IT UP. THAT'S WHEN  IT SERVED MY ENEMIES. BUT TIMES HAVE CHANGED. NOW IT CAN BRING US ENOUGH POWER  TO GET RID OF VODEN AS WELL. RIGHT, TAO? I'M NOT SURE WE'RE TALKING KIM, THAT ROAD CAN BE MADE  LESS DAMAGING TO NATURE. LESS DAMAGING TO NATURE? NOT A BAD IDEA. DAR, THE WORLD'S NOT PERFECT -- MAYBE YOU SHOULD  LISTEN TO MY LITTLE BROTHER. CAN YOU STOP  CALLING ME THAT? I'M SURE THERE'S A WAY THAT  WE CAN FIND A COMPROMISE HERE. COME ON! WANT ME TO TELL KIM  HE'S SENT A BUNCH OF WE'VE ALREADY GAINED  200 PACES SINCE YESTERDAY. YOUR BROTHER  WILL BE PROUD. THERE'S NOTHING  TO BE PROUD OF HERE. THIS IS NOT RIGHT.  THIS HAS TO STOP! TAO. WE DIDN'T SAVE THEM  FROM THE PRIESTS FOR THIS. NOT WHILE STAYING  IN VODEN'S FAVOUR. IS ANYONE'S FAVOUR WORTH THIS? WHY SET UP A COUNCIL TO OVERSEE  HOW THE ROAD IS BEING BUILT? BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY  XINCA USED TO BE RUN. EVERYONE'S NEEDS  HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT --  IT'S THE EIRON WAY. THE EIRON WAY  KILLED OUR PARENTS. THE PRIESTS  KILLED OUR PARENTS. YES! AFTER THE WISE EIRON COUNCIL TALKED,  BUT DID NOTHING TO STOP THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN! NOT WHILE I'M IN CONTROL. YOU'RE TURNING  PEOPLE INTO SLAVES. I'M MAKING THEM ALLIES  OF THE STRONGEST KING THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. VODEN'S OFFICIAL APPROVAL  FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING. HE'S EVEN GIVEN ME SOME OF HIS  SOLDIERS TO KEEP ORDER. DON'T YOU SEE? WE CAN'T FIGHT HIM...NOT YET. BUT BY PLEASING VODEN, I'M  SECURING OUR PEOPLE'S FAVOUR. IN TIME, THEY'LL SEE...  AND SO WILL YOU. HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? THE REAL WORLD'S NOT QUITE  WHAT YOU'D LIKE IT TO BE, IS IT,  LITTLE BROTHER? I'M UNSURE WHAT  THE REAL WORLD IS ANYMORE. WHAT'S HAPPENING  TO YOU? I'M DOING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. FOR OUR PEOPLE, THE  XINCANS, OR YOU? WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE! WE CAN MAKE XINCA  WHATEVER WE WANT IT TO BE. WALK WITH ME. LET'S SEE IF OUR PEOPLE  ARE AS UNHAPPY AS YOU. FRIEND. WHAT'S HE DOING HERE? OH, NO. THIS IS WHAT YOUR ROAD DOES. YOU'RE LIKE A BAD DREAM. WHY CAN'T YOU JUST MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS? THAT DEER IS MY BUSINESS! WHAT HAPPENED? PROGRESS. TAO BELIEVED IN YOU. OF XINCA -- IT WAS ONE WHERE  PEOPLE LIVED IN HARMONY, AND THEY LOOKED AFTER  ONE ANOTHER. MY BROTHER BELIEVES  IN FAIRY TALES. HE SPENT TOO LONG WITH A MAN WHO CLAIMS HE CAN  TALK WITH THE ANIMALS. AT LEAST WITH ME HE WAS SAFE. AS LONG AS YOU'RE ALIVE, YOU'RE GOING TO BE TROUBLE, AREN'T YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M KEEPING THE PEACE,  LITTLE BROTHER. KEEPING THE PEACE. I DON'T KNOW  WHAT I CAN DO. WE CAN'T LET DAR DIE,  AND IF I GO, KIM CLAIMS HE'LL  KILL HIM ON THE SPOT, BUT YOU MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE. YOUR BROTHER HAS  VODEN'S BLESSING. YOU KNOW HE'D DO IT FOR YOU. THIS PLACE HAS ALWAYS  INSPIRED FEAR. A WISE LEADER KNOWS  THAT FEAR IS NOT HIS ENEMY. WHERE'S TAO? DON'T YOU WANT  HIM TO SEE HOW YOU'LL KEEP THE  PEACE IN XINCA? BEING WITH YOU HAS CONFUSED TAO. BUT NOW THAT HE'S BACK IN  CIVILIZATION WHERE HE BELONGS, HE'LL COME AROUND. [ YELLING ] -ARINA!  -STAY OUT OF IT, TAO! STAY OUT OF IT! NOOO! LITTLE BROTHER... AH...KIM. DO YOU THINK  HE'LL EVER COME BACK? TO XINCA? I THINK WHATEVER HOPES AND DREAMS IT HELD FOR HIM ARE GONE. I THINK I FINALLY DECIDED  WHAT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR. AND WHAT YOU  HAVE TO STAND AGAINST. VODEN WILL  COME AFTER YOU. WON'T DO HIM ANY GOOD. YOU DON'T LEARN HOW TO TRACK WITHOUT LEARNING  TO COVER YOUR TRAIL. YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME WITH US. I THINK I NEED  SOME TIME TO MYSELF. SOMEHOW I THINK YOU'LL  ALWAYS BE ABLE TO FIND ME. OR MAYBE I'LL FIND YOU. WHAT WORDS DO YOU SAY  FOR A BROTHER? THAT, WHATEVER  HE WAS -- WHATEVER THE WORLD  THOUGHT OF HIM -- HE'LL ALWAYS  BE MY BROTHER. WHERE DO YOU  WANT TO GO NOW? WHEREVER YOU NEED TO GO. HOW DO YOU THINK XINCA WILL  REMEMBER KIM? AS THE MAN WHO RID THEM OF THE PRIESTS AND BROUGHT  THE EIRONS HOME. IT'S ONLY THE GOOD  THAT PEOPLE REMEMBER. THE REST JUST...GOES AWAY. CAPTIONS PERFORMED BY  THE NATIONAL CAPTIONING CENTRE
