 -And Leandra? -In the morgue. Like Corey Welch. Dead. You sent her to kill me. [engine revving] That means you're afraid of me. I wish I'd known ten years ago what you really were. I'd have saved us both a lot of trouble. I wish I'd known the real reason that this town is rotten. It's you. So I'm gonna fix it. I'm gonna kill you. -Then come straightaway. -Why? So your brother can watch you die before I kill him, too. [siren vocalizing] [door opens] [chuckling] Oh, yes. I've been trying to get rid of him for a long time. Thank you. I didn't do it for you, Mr. Stolin. [Dylan] The hell is going on? That's your business partner tied up in there. I have a new business partner now. And what does he want from us? Mr. Stolin wants what we want, to see the mothers. You're gonna show a stranger the sirens? Yes. I'll take his money, and I will get rid of him. You know, we can't just kill and kill and kill. That makes us no better than them. We are better than them. We are irreplaceable. They're not. Who will miss one or two? You don't feel that way about Augie. But you're gonna kill him anyway for Stolin. I've given up too much to have feelings. And what will Cal do when she finds out you've murdered her brother? You have seen what she wants to do. She wants me dead. And you have seen what I want to do. You have to choose between this girl, who has caused chaos since she returned, and me, who found you, and raised you, and cared for you. And is the only one who can bring your mother back. You choose. Have you seen Lamar? I'm sorry. That's all right. Now what? We leave. As soon as we can. [Cal] Mom. [footsteps approaching] Adrielle tried to kill me. -She's got Augie. -Why? What does she want? I think she's gonna kill him. [gasps] Oh, God. This was not supposed to happen. You brought Stolin in to get rid of the Tidelanders? [sighs] Wow. Well, didn't you fuck up. Congratulations, they're working together now, Adrielle and Stolin, and they have Augie. And it's all your fault. -I need you to get him back. -I'm going to. And I know what she wants more than anything. I need to know what happened to Dad the night he died. What did he find? Old piece of broken pottery in a drug shipment. -What did he do with it? -I don't know. He never told me anything. You were the one he trusted. I've got something for you. Here. Thank you! [Pat] Don't tell your mother about it. Or the box, all right? It's actually more valuable. I don't want her hocking it. Just keep it hidden. Cal? I mean it. There's plenty of sharks about at the moment. Pays to be careful. [groans, gags] [Lamar] Why are we stopping? I've just gotta do one more thing. I'll be right back. [Murdoch] Fuck. [breathes deeply] Hello? -What were you thinking, Murdoch? -[grunts, groaning] You found Pat's body washed up and decided to keep it? [panting] Insurance? Well, I figured if you and I ever had a disagreement, you wouldn't want me showing Augie how you killed his father. Where is your friend Lamar? I know all about you and him. He's kept your cancer from spreading all these years. Long gone. [groaning] I don't believe you. Where is he? [groaning] -He won't go far without you. -[groans] Will you, Lamar? None of us can stay away from here for long. Leave him alone. [Murdoch groaning] It's too late for him. Look who you've become, Adrielle. When your people see it, too, they'll end you. Go! So, is this a good sign or a bad one? Aren't cigarettes what they give the prisoner right before the blindfold? I don't know. Listen. Adrielle... I know how you feel about her. I know you'd do anything for her. But this? This has all gone too far. -You know it. -You could never know how far is too far. You know what you are. You have a mother. You and I... we're very different. But we both love Cal. What's going on with her? You should be more worried about yourself. It's hard to enjoy a good rib eye when you're tied up, Somoche. I'd make it worth your while. Loosen these ropes a little? Don't even bother, Somoche. Are you gonna kill me? I don't want to. I thought you wanted to be safe. I thought you wanted to keep this place a secret. I was giving you that. I was giving you everything you wanted. So, why Stolin? All I want is his money. -But it's more than you can give. -You've barely given me a chance to try. There's no time. Why? What's so important that you need that much money? Augie... you've been fishing in the most precious waters in the world. Precious? That's not the word we use. What, you think we don't know what's out there? You think we don't hear them? They're not precious. They're nightmares. And they've been killing people like me forever. And having children like me. Or Cal. The difference is she's not full of hate, unlike you. You're losing control. I'm not giving this up. Your people might have other plans. Don't you dare hurt her! -[Bijou] Hi. -Hi. I've been waiting for you. I've done some more drawings of our mother. There. You've come to save your brother. He's in the house. I need your help. [police radio chatter] [Cal] What does this have to do with Augie? -[Bijou] I think he's the one who-- -[Gilles] It's you. You're the one that gets her killed. Wait! Don't go. I just need one thing. [Bijou] Please, Gilles. It has to be. [cop] That's correct, sir. Both local officers. Just cordoning off the area. Better have Brisbane send up a team ASAP. -Where's Dylan? -I don't know. What do you want? Sorry to disturb you, but there's something you need to know. [people chattering] [Adrielle] You think you can stop me? [Cal panting] -Where the fuck is my brother? -You'll see. [grunts] [clanging] Is my brother still alive? Your brother? -Yes, not like Leandra. -You sent her to kill me. Why are you so afraid of me, Adrielle? And my father, Pat? Were you afraid of him, too? He found something I wanted and tried to keep it from me. So that, that's what this is all about? And you think you can get every piece lost over all this time? You touched one, didn't you? You felt its power. "To call our mothers back." That's what my people need. So we don't have to live like we do. Orphans. You're not doing this for your people. You don't care about our mothers. You just wanna kill men. Not one or two, but all of them. Yeah, you wanna burn down the whole damn house. I know the feeling. Difference is I grew out of it. Difference is... you're behind bars and I'm not. Why didn't you kill me? I want to. But I need another crone for this cell. You wanna know what I see? I bring a siren, not you. You don't know whether to kill me or not. You've lost control, Adrielle. Killing Augie won't change that. -[footsteps approaching] -[doors open] Where have you been? Your man Stolin's here. -I don't see the money. -It's on its way. What is this? [whispering] Blessings from your people for this new venture. Okay. Shall we? -Hello, Augie. -Fuck you. So that is what my money is going to help build? Can I see it? Of course. [keys jangling] And the blood is going to call the sirens? Yes. Good. [cell phone buzzes] The money has arrived. Are you all right? I'm fine. Find the boy. He's taken my necklace. Now! -Thank you. -[Dylan] Calliope. Go. She had me locked down there. I'm sorry about Corey. Where's Augie? Adrielle's gonna kill him. I know you were right. We have to end this. [cutting] -[Adrielle] What are you doing? -I'm taking over your good work. Put the pieces in. No. You can't do this. It won't work for you. The way you're worried tells me maybe it will. [sighs] -You must stop! -[Gregori] I think you've lost your touch. You don't know where to begin. Your dealer Hasham Deeb will assist. -I'll get the rest of the shards. -I'll kill you if you try. I'd hoped you wouldn't say it. [Cal] Stop. Put down the guns. And let Dylan and my brother go, or I smash this into dust. And no one puts it back together. She won't. She wants this as much as we do. Try me. -Okay. -No! Cal! ["Appalacherna" playing] [grunting, groaning] [groans] -[Dylan] No! -[groans] [Adrielle] The shards! -[grunts] -[Cal] Augie! No! -[Cal groaning] -Let her go! -[Augie] Cal! -Hey. You okay? [screaming] [clamoring] Get them! [woman grunts] [man 1] Get in the car! [man 2] Get in the car! Go! -Where the hell is Stolin? -Where the hell is Augie? [Cal] Augie? [grunts] Let's go. I'm missing one. [grunts, groans] [Cal] Augie? -That's for my eye. -[Cal] Augie, where are you? [speaking Spanish] [Adrielle groaning] Leave us. Where is Augie? How did you get that piece? Dad. You killed him over it, but he made sure you only got half. We can rebuild it together, you and me. Please. We can rule as one. -We can have it all. -I don't want what you want. You are the daughter of a siren. You won't be able to help yourself. Madam, I found your brother. Take me to him. [groans] [Gregori] Keep moving! Keep moving! [groaning] [Cal] Augie! -Let him go! -[Augie] Get out of here, Cal! I counted on you joining us, Ms. McTeer. Give me the shard. -Just leave! -Give me the shard! Or your brother's dead. [Augie] Don't give this prick anything. [Augie] Cal. -Don't. -[Stolin] Now! Or I shoot him! [Stolin] Give it to me! -[both grunt] -Go, go, run, Augie! -[gunshot] -[Bijou screams] [Cal] No! Bijou! [gunshot] Augie! Augie! [gunshot] [panting] [Augie] Where-- Where's Stolin? [Cal shouts] You're bleeding. Give me the shard! Give me the shard! [sirens singing] [siren] Come. Come. He shot you. [groans] Don't move. -Help the girl. -[Cal sobbing] It's my fault. Save her. But you'll die. [Cal] Hold on, okay? [whimpers] [labored breathing] What the hell? Adrielle. [groans] [shudders] [blood bubbling] [heart beating] Who did this to you? Cal. Cal McTeer. You're lying. You know your people won't forgive you. You know that you're no longer queen. I'm sorry, my love. [groans] [labored breathing] Aug! What do I do? -It's okay. Hold on, okay? -She's here. Please! Please! I can't help them both. Save Augie. Okay, okay. I'd like to save you, but... Adrielle, what are you doing? No, no! No, you have to help him! [sobbing] Just like the prophecy. Me, you, and the girl. [whimpers] Aug! But no siren. I should have never doubted myself. I will always be queen. No. No! Please. He'll die! Come back! Cal. Cal! Save the girl. That's why you're here.
