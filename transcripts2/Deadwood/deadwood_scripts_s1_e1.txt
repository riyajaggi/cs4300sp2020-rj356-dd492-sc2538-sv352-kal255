YOU LISTEN, MISTER, IT WAS A MASSACRE. I'M THE ONE WHO SAW IT. AND THERE AIN'T NO ONE WAS ALIVE. DID YOU SEE THE MASSACRE OR NOT? I TOLD YOU I GOT THERE AFTERWARDS. SO BY THEN, THE CHILD COULD'VE GOT AWAY FROM WHERE YOU SAW THOSE OTHER BODIES? OR THE CHILD COULD'VE BEEN HIDING AND SO AFRAID OF WHO YOU MIGHT BE, IT DIDN'T CALL OUT. YOU LISTEN TO ME, I AIN'T GOING BACK OUT THERE AGAIN TONIGHT, SO YOU MIND YOUR OWN GODDAMN BUSINESS!

NOW IT'S NOT FOR ME TO TELL ANYONE IN THIS CAMP WHAT TO DO, MUCH AS I DON'T WANT MORE PEOPLE GETTING THEIR THROATS CUT, THEIR SCALPS LIFTED, OR ANY OTHER GODLESS THING THAT THESE GODLESS BLOODTHIRSTY HEATHENS DO- OR EVEN IF SOMEONE WANTS TO RIDE OUT IN DARKEST NIGHT, BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS: I'D USE TONIGHT TO GET MYSELF ORGANIZED, RIDE OUT IN THE MORNING, CLEAR-HEADED, AND STARTING TOMORROW MORNING, I WILL OFFER A PERSONAL $50 BOUNTY FOR EVERY DECAPITATED HEAD OF AS MANY OF THESE GODLESS HEATHEN COCKSUCKERS AS ANYONE CAN BRING IN, TOMORROW, WITH NO UPPER LIMIT!

YOU KNOW I DON'T INTRUDE ON THE AFFAIRS OF OTHERS. PROBLEM ENOUGH KEEPING MY OWN LIFE STRAIGHT. WHEN SOMETHING'S NOT MY AFFAIR, I DON'T PRETEND IT IS. CONTRARIWISE, IF YOU FEEL LIKE TALKING ABOUT THAT HEADLIGHT... I'LL PAY A DOLLAR A MINUTE TO HEAR YOU. GET ANYTHING OFF YOUR CHEST YOU FEEL LIKE. WHAT I GOT ON MY CHEST DON'T CONCERN YOU, ELLSWORTH.
