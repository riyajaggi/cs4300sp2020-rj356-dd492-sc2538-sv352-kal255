 SO THIS IS WHERE THE TRAIN CAME... LOADED UP THE GOLD, HEADED ON OUT OF RICHMOND. Narrator: RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, GROUND ZERO FOR ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYSTERIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THERE IS NO BIGGER TREASURE TO LOOK FOR OR FIND. Narrator: IN THIS FORMER REBEL CAPITAL, AN ESTIMATED $20 MILLION WORTH OF CONFEDERATE TREASURE WAS LOADED ONTO A SOUTHBOUND TRAIN AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME TO A DEADLY, TRAUMATIC END. Arnold: DURING THE END OF THE WAR, LEE SENT WORD TO JEFF DAVIS

 THAT HE COULD NOT HOLD THE LINES NO MORE, THAT HE NEEDED TO LEAVE RICHMOND. Scott: JEFFERSON DAVIS TOOK ALL THIS GOLD, 1 1/2 TONS, AND LOADED IT UP ON A TRAIN AND TRIED TO GET OUT OF RICHMOND BEFORE RICHMOND FELL. Narrator: THE TREASURE CONSISTED OF CONFEDERATE GOLD, SILVER, JEWELS, NOTES, BONDS, AND A KEG OF COPPER PENNIES. Scott: THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THIS TREASURE COULD BE ANYWHERE BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $50 MILLION, BUT HISTORICALLY, THIS TREASURE IS PRICELESS. ** Narrator: THE TRAIN RACED THE UNION ARMY SOUTH. JEFF DAVIS KNEW HE HAD TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE AND FAST. Narrator: BUT WHEN THE TRAIN FINALLY PULLED INTO WASHINGTON, GEORGIA,

 THE SOUTH HAD FALLEN. BY THE TIME JEFFERSON DAVIS WAS CAPTURED, THE TREASURE HAD VANISHED INTO THIN AIR. THERE'S A LOT OF THEORIES AS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO IT, WHERE IT WENT. Narrator: FOR MORE THAN 150 YEARS, FORTUNE HUNTERS HAVE SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW ALONG A 500-MILE TRAIL OF TRAIN TRACKS, DIRT ROADS, AND WATERWAYS FOR THE LONG-LOST CONFEDERATE GOLD. ALL HAVE FAILED, BUT NOW AN ALL-STAR TEAM OF TREASURE HUNTERS HAS UNCOVERED CLUES THAT COULD FINALLY SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE LOST REBEL GOLD. WHOO! WE IN BUSINESS! HOLY [BLEEP] CAN YOU IMAGINE TAKING A BIG SCOOP OF SILVER COINS? [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] WE GOT SOME TREASURE, BUDDY! THIS IS THE BIG MOMENT. THIS IS WHAT WE DO THIS FOR. STAY WITH ME. I'LL LEAD YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND. HOLD UP. HOLD UP. HOLD UP. HOLD UP. THAT IS IT. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: THE HUNT FOR $20 MILLION IN LOST CONFEDERATE TREASURE BEGINS IN DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, CAPITAL OF A VAST TOBACCO EMPIRE DURING THE CIVIL WAR. THIS PLACE WAS A LOT DIFFERENT NOW THAN IT WAS 150 YEARS AGO. WELL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DIG HARD ON THIS ONE, BUDDY. YOU AIN'T KIDDING. SOMEWHERE WITHIN 100 YARDS OF WHERE WE'RE AT, THERE WAS A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD AND SILVER. YEAH. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE FIRST STOP OF JEFFERSON DAVIS AND HIS CABINET WHEN THEY WERE FLEEING RICHMOND, VIRGINIA. THEY WERE HERE FROM APRIL 3rd TO APRIL 10, 1865. ** DAVIS MADE DANVILLE THE CONFEDERATE CAPITAL AFTER RICHMOND FELL, AND FOR SEVEN DAYS, HE RULED FROM THIS ONCE-PROSPEROUS CITY, PLOTTING HIS FUTURE AND THE FATE OF THE TREASURE. WITH UNION TROOPS ADVANCING, DAVIS NEEDED TO GET WHAT REMAINED OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE AS FAR SOUTH AS POSSIBLE. THIS MEANT TRANSFERRING 1 1/2 TONS OF GOLD AND SILVER FROM THE DANVILLE TRAIN LINE TO THE CHESTER LINE. THIS IS WHERE THE FIRST PORTION OF THE TREASURE VANISHED. Cissna: THE THING ABOUT THIS GOLD... IT'S NOT JUST ONE PLACE. THERE'S A LOT OF TENTACLES OR FINGERS WHERE IT WENT, AND THEY'RE SPREAD OUT. THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY. Narrator: 200,000 MEXICAN SILVER COINS, TODAY WORTH OVER $2 MILLION, DISAPPEARED IN DANVILLE JUST 17 DAYS BEFORE THE UNION ARMY TOOK THE CITY. ** THE SILVER WAS NEVER FOUND. WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THEY LEFT 39 KEGS OF MEXICAN SILVER DOLLARS HERE. WE REALLY WANT TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT'S AT. FOR OVER 150 YEARS, FORTUNE HUNTERS HAVE CHASED THE MISSING DANVILLE SILVER. SOME SAY IT WAS TAKEN OFF THE TRAIN AND SUNK DEEP IN THE ICY WATERS OF THE DAN RIVER. ** OTHERS SAY IT WAS BURIED WITH THE BODIES OF THE UNION PRISONERS WHO DIED IN DANVILLE'S MANY GULAGS. BUT DESPITE COUNTLESS SEARCHES IN AND AROUND DANVILLE, THE $2 MILLION IN SILVER HAS NEVER BEEN FOUND, BUT LARRY CISSNA IS CONFIDENT THAT HE HAS NEW INFORMATION THAT WILL LEAD TO THE LOST TREASURE. IT'S LIKE A GAME OF CLUE. YOU WANT TO SEE WHO CAN SOLVE THE MYSTERY FIRST, AND THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTIGATORS OUT HERE IN THE WORLD. YOU JUST WANT TO BE THE BEST, AND YOU WANT TO BE THE GUY. TO UNRAVEL THIS 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY, LARRY CISSNA HAS ASSEMBLED A TEAM OF TALENTED AND DEDICATED RELIC HUNTERS, MEN WHO ALL SHARE THE SAME OBSESSION... FINDING THE LOST REBEL GOLD. WE'RE GOING TO MEET UP WITH SOME OF THE BEST TREASURE HUNTERS IN THE WORLD TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE POSSIBLE LEADS OF WHERE THIS TREASURE CAN BE BURIED. WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP? WELL, HEY. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. WHAT'S UP, LARRY? BROTHER, MY BROTHER. HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY? WHAT'S UP, DUDE? PETEY. HOW WAS THE RIDE DOWN? LONG. Narrator: JOINING LARRY IS LONG-TIME FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE TRACY SHORT AND A NEWCOMER TO THE SEARCH TEAM, BRANT ARNOLD. HEY, Y'ALL, THIS IS BRANT. HEY, BRANT. PETE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. BRANT, WEST TENNESSEE. Cissna: I'M LARRY FROM TEXAS. NICE TO MEET YOU, BROTHER. I'M BRANT. NOW, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. NOW, THESE ARE THE EIGHT REALES, MEXICAN DOLLARS. THEY'RE REALLY BIG CHUNK OF SILVER. THEY'RE OLD, AND IT GETS YOU FIRED UP TO GO LOOK FOR SOME MORE. YA'LL CAN HOLD 'EM IF YOU WANT TO. I GOT PLENTY FOR EVERYBODY TO HOLD HERE. YEAH, BOY. I HAD ACTUALLY FOUND THESE AT SOME PREVIOUS SITES I HUNTED BACK IN TEXAS. I ONLY BROUGHT THREE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR 9,000 POUNDS OF IT. THAT'S A BIG COIN, FELLA. MM-HMM. SO, IS THIS A STARTING PRESENT? Eles: NO, IT IS NOT. YOU GOT TO EARN THAT. [ LAUGHTER ] ** Narrator: THE TEAM IS ROUNDED OUT WITH THREE VETERAN TREASURE HUNTERS, EACH AN EXPERT IN THEIR FIELD. ** HEY, BRANT. EARL MESIMER, CENTRAL VIRGINIA. NICE TO MEET YOU. HE'S BEEN RELIC HUNTING FOR 30-PLUS YEARS. THIS IS DAN YARRUSSO. NICE TO MEET YOU, DAN. NICE TO MEET YOU. FROM YONKERS, NEW YORK. HE'S OUR WATER SPECIALIST, AND MIKE SCOTT. GOOD TO MEET YOU, MAN. NICE TO MEET YOU, BRO. HE'S FROM WISCONSIN. HE'S OUR EQUIPMENT SPECIALIST. WHATEVER WE NEED, HE CAN HOOK US UP WITH IT, ALL RIGHT? SOUNDS GOOD. THE BEST WAY TO FIND THIS GOLD AND BEAT ALL THE OTHER TREASURE HUNTERS IS FOR US ALL TO TEAM UP, POOL OUR RESOURCES, AND GIVE IT A GOOD SHOT. HEY, THIS IS GONNA BE GOOD. Mesimer: REALLY, I DON'T EXPECT US TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING. WE'RE FROM DIFFERENT STATES AND DIFFERENT AREAS AND, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. WE MAY BUTT HEADS, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO TEAR US APART. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE ALL HAVE THE EXACT SAME GOAL... TO FIND A TREASURE. Narrator: TREASURE HUNTING IS NOT A TEAM SPORT. RIVALRIES ARE ALL PART OF THE GAME, BUT TO FINALLY UNLOCK THIS AGE-OLD MYSTERY, LARRY'S TEAM HAS AGREED TO WORK TOGETHER WITH ONE COMMON GOAL IN MIND. YOU KNOW, USUALLY WHEN WE'RE OUT DOING THIS, YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU FIND, YOU GET TO KEEP. IT'S YOURS. YOU KNOW, YOU GO OUT THERE, YOU FOUND IT. THIS IS MORE OF A... THIS IS A DIFFERENT SITUATION. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT SEVEN GUYS. IT'S A TEAM OF US THAT'S LOOKING FOR THIS BIGGER THING. WELL, I KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO. I WANT TO TAKE DAN AND PETE, IF THAT'S COOL. WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE SUTHERLIN MANSION. ALL RIGHT. I WANT TO GO CHECK THE WALLS, CHECK THE GROUNDS. YOU GOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERACY STAYING THERE. THIS IS THE TREASURY OF THIS CONFEDERACY. COME ON. THEY COULD'VE PUT SOMETHING IN THE WALLS. YOU GOT TO CHECK IT OUT. I WANT TO GO TO THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LEAD FROM HERE IN TOWN. THERE WAS TWO MEXICAN SILVER COINS FOUND OUT THERE ON IT, SO I WANT TO TAKE TRACY AND HEAD OUT THERE AND CHECK IT OUT. THAT SOUND GOOD. IF THERE WAS SILVER, I'LL GO WITH YOU GUYS. GOOD LUCK, YOU ALL. OKAY, FELLAS. ALL RIGHT. YEAH. GOOD LUCK, GUYS. ** Narrator: THE TEAM SPLITS INTO TWO GROUPS TO COVER MORE GROUND. BOTH WILL STRAY FROM THE PATHS OF PAST TREASURE HUNTERS. THEY'LL EXPLORE UNCHARTED TERRITORY, TWO VIRGIN SITES MILES FROM THE DANVILLE TRAIN STATION, THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION TO THE WEST... WHERE TWO SILVER COINS WERE RECENTLY FOUND BY SOME LOCAL BOYS... AND SUTHERLIN MANSION, THE FORMER ESTATE OF TOBACCO BARON WILLIAM THOMAS SUTHERLIN, A CLOSE FRIEND OF THE CONFEDERACY. Eles: I KNOW FOR A FACT JEFFERSON DAVIS STAYED IN THE SUTHERLIN MANSION. WE KNOW THAT GEORGE TRENHOLM, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY, STAYED THERE. SO IF YOU GOT THE GUY THAT HAS CONTROL OF THE CASH AND YOU GOT THE GUY TELL HIM HOW TO SPEND IT, RIGHT? MM-HMM. YEP. WHAT A BETTER PLACE TO LOOK? RIGHT. THERE IT IS. YEP. I THINK WE'RE HERE. SO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE TRUE LAST CAPITOL OF THE CONFEDERACY, APRIL 3, APRIL 10, 1865. [ CAR DOORS OPEN ] A WHOLE WEEK, RIGHT? THIS WOULD BE THEIR LAST MEETING OF THE ACTUAL CABINET OF THE CONFEDERACY, BEFORE THEY HEADED SOUTH AND THEY STARTED FALLING TO THE WAYSIDE. ** Narrator: TREASURE HUNTER AND HISTORIAN LARRY CISSNA IS ON A QUEST TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF $20 MILLION OF LOST CONFEDERATE TREASURE. IT'S BEEN A LIFELONG OBSESSION FOR THE TEXAS-BORN TREASURE HUNTER. Cissna: I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 32 YEARS. THE REASON I DO IT, I LOVE HISTORY. IT'S THE DISCOVERY OF SOMETHING NOBODY ELSE HAS EVER FOUND. THAT'S THE LOVE OF HISTORY. THERE'S A LOT OF TREASURE OUT THERE TO BE FOUND, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IF WE FIND THE GOLD, WE'RE PART OF HISTORY. ** Narrator: LARRY BELIEVES THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS AND HIS CABINET MAY HAVE HIDDEN THE $2 MILLION IN MEXICAN COINS IN THE LAST PLACE THEY MET BEFORE FLEEING SOUTH. HE'S BANKING ON THE SILVER BEING UNTOUCHED FOR THE LAST 150 YEARS. IT WAS A COMMON PRACTICE TO HIDE THINGS IN THE WALL BACK THEN. IT WAS EASY. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST REGULAR MONEY HERE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FUNDS OF THE CONFEDERACY, FUNDS THAT WOULD HAVE KEPT THE CONFEDERACY ALIVE AND GOING WELL LATER. THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE PUT IN A BANK. Narrator: FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, LARRY AND HIS TEAM ARE GRANTED UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST SOUGHT AFTER HISTORICAL LANDMARKS. SO THIS WAS JEFFERSON DAVIS' ROOM WHEN HE STAYED HERE. WHEN THE UNIONS CAME TO DANVILLE, THERE'S NO RECORD OF THEM COMING IN AND REALLY SEARCHING THE PLACE. THEY GAVE A LOT OF RESPECT TO MAJOR SUTHERLIN. Cissna: THE WALLS THAT I WANT TO CHECK... I WANT TO DO HERE, HERE, AND HERE, ALL RIGHT? SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OTHER ROOM, IT MIGHT BE THE SAME WAY AND WE GET RIGHT TO IT. ** DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN MUCH RENOVATION, IF ANY AT ALL, TO THE WALL, SO THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND ALSO, IT DOESN'T APPEAR, BY RECORD, THAT THE PLACE WAS RANSACKED. LET'S JUST HOPE SOMEBODY PUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS. IT'S THERE, OUR NAMES GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. IF IT AIN'T, WE JUST KEEP LOOKING UNTIL WE DO PUT THEM IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. [ CHUCKLES ] ** Narrator: COMING UP... THAT'S A GOOD HIT. ...LARRY AND HIS TEAM IMMEDIATELY HIT IT BIG INSIDE THE WALLS OF JEFFERSON DAVIS' BEDROOM. Cissna: STOP RIGHT THERE. IT'S LIKE A LITTLE BOX. COULD $2 MILLION IN SILVER BE HIDDEN BEHIND THESE HISTORIC WALLS? SILVER COINS STUCK BACK THERE. Narrator: MEANWHILE, OVER AT THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION... [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] ...AN EXCITING FIND DEEP IN THE GROUND CAUSES TEMPERS TO FLARE... COME ON, BRANT. WE ONLY GOT A LITTLE BIT OF DAYLIGHT LEFT. NO. I'M NOT GOING NOWHERE. GET OUT OF THERE. YOU GIVE ME FIVE [BLEEP] MINUTES HERE WITH NOBODY BOTHERING, AND I FIND [BLEEP] Narrator: ...AND DEEP-SEATED ANGER TO RESURFACE. THE LAST DAMN THING I NEED IS SOME YANKEE STANDING ON TOP OF THE HILL TELLING ME HOW TO DO A JOB THAT I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO. ** Narrator: IN 1865, AS UNION TROOPS WERE SEIZING RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, JEFFERSON DAVIS BOARDED A TRAIN WITH $20 MILLION OF CONFEDERATE TREASURE AND HEADED SOUTH. THE FIRST STOP WAS HERE, DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, WHERE THE TREASURE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE RAILROAD TRACK TO ANOTHER. DURING THAT THREE-DAY SPAN, A PORTION OF THE TREASURE WENT MISSING... 39 KEGS OF MEXICAN SILVER COINS, A BOUNTY THAT TODAY WOULD BE WORTH AS MUCH AS $2 MILLION. WHILE LARRY CISSNA AND HIS TEAM SEARCH THE WALLS OF SUTHERLIN MANSION ON ONE SIDE OF DANVILLE, CIVIL WAR TREASURE HUNTERS BRANT ARNOLD AND TRACY SHORT ARE TRACING ANOTHER LEAD ON THE SILVER COINS NINE MILES OUT OF TOWN. WELL, WE KNOW DAVIS COME THROUGH HERE, AND WE KNOW THAT HE UNLOADED THE COINS HERE. THIS COULD BE THE ONE. I HOPE IT'S THE ONE. BRANT IS BANKING ON A COUPLE OF MEXICAN SILVER COINS RECENTLY FOUND NEAR THE PLANTATION AS BEING THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. HE'S SURE THIS PROMINENT SITE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IDEAL LOCATION FOR JEFFERSON DAVIS TO HIDE HIS 39 KEGS OF SILVER. THIS PLACE HAS NEVER BEEN HUNTED SINCE THE CIVIL WAR. TWO KIDS ON FOOT, NOT METAL DETECTORS... [ CHUCKLES ] ...PICKED UP SILVER COINS. THEREFORE, IF THEY CAN SEE IT BY EYEBALLS AND PICK IT UP, WHAT'S UNDER THE GROUND THAT THE MACHINES IS GOING TO PICK UP THAT YOU CAN'T SEE? YOU KNOW WHAT WE AIN'T EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT? I BET THIS JEEP WON'T HAUL 39 KEGS OF SILVER. AS A SOUTHERNER, THE TREASURE AND ITS HISTORY HOLD A SPECIAL ALLURE TO BRANT. ** FINDING THE GOLD WOULD BE SORT OF LIKE CLIMBING EVEREST AND BEING THE FIRST MAN ON TOP OF IT. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS, AND MY NAME BEING IN THE MUSEUM OF THE CONFEDERACY, I'D BE THERE FOREVER. ** Narrator: BRANT IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE TOP CIVIL WAR RELIC HUNTERS IN THE WORLD. HAVING GROWN UP A STONE'S THROW FROM THE BATTLE OF SHILOH, HE HAS BEEN STEEPED IN THE LORE OF THE CIVIL WAR SINCE HE WAS A CHILD. Arnold: THIS RIGHT HERE IS THE ONLY PAIR IN EXISTENCE OF CONFEDERATE CAVALRY BOOTS THAT WAS DUG OUT OF THE GROUND TOGETHER THAT STILL HAS THE CONFEDERATE SPURS ON THEM. THIS IS ALL POKER CHIPS. THEY WAS BORED SITTING AROUND CAMP. THEY'D TAKE BULLETS AND BEAT THEM INTO POKER CHIPS AND USE THEM TO GAMBLE. ** OH, I'VE DONE EVERYTHING FROM BULL RIDING TO DRIVING MONSTER TRUCKS. THERE'S NO BETTER FEELING THAN FINDING A UNIQUE FIND OUT OF THE GROUND. THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT. NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT. Short: MAN, I HOPE IT'S A GOOD PLACE. OH [BLEEP] [ CHUCKLES ] OH, NO, MAN. LOOK AT THIS. WHEN HE SAID "PLANTATION," I THOUGHT HE MEANT PLANTATION THEY'RE LIVING IN. I DIDN'T MEAN HE MEANT THE RUINS. Narrator: WHILE MOST OF THE OUT BUILDINGS OF THIS LEGENDARY TOBACCO PLANTATION FELL INTO RUIN AFTER THE CIVIL WAR... THE MAIN HOUSE WAS OCCUPIED UNTIL 1988, WHEN A FIRE DESTROYED IT. TODAY, THE PROPERTY IS STILL OWNED BY THE HAIRSTONS, AN EIGHTH-GENERATION DANVILLE FAMILY. DEAN HAIRSTON, WHO CURRENTLY MANAGES THE PROPERTY, MEETS TRACY AND BRANT TO GIVE THEM THE LAY OF HIS ANCESTRAL LAND. ** Short: SO THAT'S A PHENOMENAL PIECE OF HISTORY RIGHT THERE. THIS PROPERTY'S BEEN HERE ABOUT 200 YEARS. WOW. ABOUT 1823, I BELIEVE, WAS WHEN THE HOUSE WAS BUILT. IT WAS SEVERAL THOUSAND ACRES. THOSE PEOPLE HAD SOME MONEY. IT DID. SAM HAIRSTON, WHO WAS THE PROPERTY OWNER, HAD AN ESTIMATED WORTH OF ABOUT $5.2 MILLION IN 1850, SO THAT TRANSLATED TODAY'S TERM AT ABOUT $2.2 BILLION. WHOA, MAN. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, 45 PLANTATIONS OVER FOUR STATES. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE EMPIRE, THEY HAD OVER 10,000 SLAVES. MY DESCENDANTS OF MY FAMILY STAYED ON THE PROPERTY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, AND THEN LEFT. I RECENTLY DID DNA ON MY MOTHER AND FATHER'S SIDE, AND I AM DIRECTLY LINKED BACK TO THE HAIRSTONS THAT OWNED THE PROPERTY. SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF TIES TO THIS PLACE. YES, I HAVE A LOT OF TIES, DIRECT. OVER HERE, YOU HAVE, SLAVE CABINS. IT WAS FOUR UNITS. THESE UNITS WERE FOR SLAVES THAT KEPT THE HOUSE. MAN, THIS PLACE, UM, THIS... I'M IN AWE. ALL THE BRICK THAT YOU SEE HERE WAS FIRED ON THE PROPERTY, AND THEY SAY THAT IF YOU LOOK VERY CLOSELY, YOU CAN STILL SEE THE SLAVES' FINGERPRINTS IN SOME OF THE BRICK. RIGHT THERE. THERE YOU GO. THAT'S ONE RIGHT THERE. THERE'S A PERFECT THUMBPRINT. THAT'S A RELIC IN ITSELF. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE DIG STUFF OUT OF THE GROUND, WE TALK ABOUT WE WERE THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT'S TOUCHED IT IN 150 YEARS. WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S LOOKING AT SOMETHING RIGHT HERE THAT WAS TOUCHED 150 YEARS AGO, AND YOU CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE THE HANDS TOUCHED IT AT. TAKES ME BACK TO THE SUFFERING THAT THOSE POOR SLAVES WENT THROUGH AND THE MONEY THAT THESE PEOPLE MADE OFF OF 10,000 PEOPLE'S SUFFERING. IT'S OVERWHELMING IS WHAT IT IS. Narrator: AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR, UNION TROOPS SWEPT THROUGH THE SOUTH, LOOTING AND BURNING THE OLD PLANTATION HOMES. THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION WAS SPARED... TODAY, A CRUMBLING MEMORIAL OF A BYGONE ERA, BUT ALL THAT CHANGED WHEN TWO BOYS DISCOVERED MEXICAN SILVER DOLLARS ON THE PROPERTY BETWEEN THE SLAVE HOUSE AND THE MAIN HOUSE. IT IS THE FIRST PROMISING LEAD TO THE MISSING $2 MILLION IN SILVER IN OVER 150 YEARS, AND DEAN HAS ENTRUSTED IT TO BRANT AND THIS ALL-STAR TEAM OF TREASURE HUNTERS. Short: GO GET MIKE AND EARL. GET OUR EQUIPMENT, GET BACK UP HERE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN WORK WITH? YEAH. SOUNDS LIKE A WINNER TO ME. LET'S GO GET 'EM. OKAY. ** NINE MILES EAST, IN THE HEART OF DANVILLE'S MILLIONAIRE'S ROW, JUST ONE MILE FROM THE TRAIN STATION WHERE $20 MILLION IN REBEL GOLD ONCE SAT, PETE AND DAN PREP TO SEARCH DEEP IN THE WALLS OF THE SUTHERLIN MANSION. THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE THEY CAME AFTER, YOU KNOW, RICHMOND FELL. Narrator: JEFFERSON DAVIS STAYED HERE WITH HIS TREASURY SECRETARY, GEORGE TRENHOLM, FROM APRIL 3rd UNTIL APRIL 10, 1865. LARRY SUSPECTS THAT DURING THAT TIME, $2 MILLION IN CONFEDERATE SILVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIDDEN FROM UNION TROOPS IN THE MANSION WALLS. ** THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ANY TREASURE HUNTER HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO SEARCH THE HISTORIC BUILDING IN 150 YEARS. THEY TUNE THEIR METAL DETECTORS TO A FREQUENCY THAT WILL PASS OVER ANYTHING BUT TREASURE. ** AH, IT'S QUIET. THAT ELIMINATES THIS ROOM. ** Cissna: YOU KNOW, PETE, HIS SPECIALTY... WE ALWAYS CALL HIM "THE BEAGLE." YOU TURN HIM LOOSE, MAN, IF THERE'S SOMETHING HERE, HE'LL FIND THE SPOT. [ METAL DETECTOR BUZZING ] WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WOW. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIGNAL. THAT'S A GOOD HIT. WHAT'S THE READING? IT'S GETTING REAL HIGH. WE GOT A GRATE RIGHT HERE. YEAH. WE COULD TAKE THAT PROBE AND STICK IT UP THROUGH THERE, WORK OUR WAY UP, AND WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AND SEE WHAT THAT IS. LET'S GO FIND LARRY. COULD BE SOMETHING GOOD. Narrator: COMING UP, TECHNOLOGY TAKES LARRY, PETE, AND DAN BEHIND THE WALLS OF THE SUTHERLIN MANSION... BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. STOP RIGHT THERE. DON'T MOVE, DAN. ...WHERE THEY MAKE A SHOCKING DISCOVERY. SILVER COIN STUCK BACK THERE. ...WHILE AT THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION... BRANT, MIKE, COME ON OVER HERE. ...BRANT AND HIS TEAM MAKE A HUGE FIND... THAT IS IT! THAT'S WHAT WE LOOKING FOR. Narrator: ...THAT MAY LEAD THEM TO THE 39 KEGS OF SILVER IF THEY CAN REACH IT. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] ** [ METAL DETECTOR BUZZING ] WOW. IT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIGNAL. THAT'S A GOOD HIT. Narrator: 130 MILES FROM RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, WHERE THE CONFEDERATE MONEY TRAIN BEGAN ITS MAD DASH SOUTH, A 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY IS UNRAVELING AT THE TRAIN'S FIRST STOP, DANVILLE. $2 MILLION WORTH OF MEXICAN SILVER VANISHED INTO THIN AIR IN THIS FORMER TOBACCO CAPITAL. TREASURE HUNTERS LARRY CISSNA, DAN YARRUSSO, AND PETE ELES BELIEVE JEFFERSON DAVIS AND HIS CABINET HID 39 KEGS OF MEXICAN SILVER IN THE WALLS OF THE LAST CONFEDERATE CAPITAL BEFORE THE SOUTH FELL... ...THE FORMER HOME OF WILLIAM T. SUTHERLIN. [ CLEARS THROAT ] WHERE'S IT AT? HITTING RIGHT IN HERE. Eles: WHOLE PLACE IS CLEAN, EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE SPOT, AND WE'RE GOING TO BE THE FIRST PEOPLE TO LOOK IN THERE. THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT WE MIGHT FIND IN THERE. HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET US SOMETHING, AT LEAST A GOLD COIN OR SOMETHING OUT OF THERE. ** Yarrusso: AND WE GOT THIS BORESCOPE. WE CAN GO IN AND SCOPE THAT WALL AND TAKE A LOOK ON THE INSIDE OF IT AND HOPEFULLY SEE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. IF THERE'S GOLD OR SILVER IN THERE, WE'RE GOING TO FIND IT. Narrator: THE BORESCOPE USES A MINIATURE VIDEO CAMERA AT THE END OF A FLEXIBLE TUBE TO GET A LOOK INSIDE TIGHT SPACES OTHERWISE INACCESSIBLE. Cissna: WE GOT TO GO STEADY HERE, OKAY? ** THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. THERE YOU GO. KEEP COMING. ** STOP RIGHT THERE. STOP. BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. RIGHT THERE. DON'T MOVE, DAN. ** YOU SEE THAT? Eles: UH-HUH. YEAH, I SEE IT. WHAT IS THAT? I DON'T KNOW. WHAT IS THAT? Yarrusso: SILVER COIN STUCK BACK THERE. OH, MAN. JUST NEVER KNOW. ** Narrator: THROUGHOUT HISTORY, HOMEOWNERS HAVE HIDDEN VALUABLES IN WALLS, ONLY TO HAVE THEM FOUND DECADES LATER DURING RENOVATIONS. IN 2007, $200,000 WORTH OF RARE COINS WERE FOUND IN THE WALLS OF AN ABANDONED HOME IN PENNSYLVANIA. IN 2006, A CONTRACTOR IN CLEVELAND, OHIO, UNCOVERED NEARLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN A BATHROOM WALL. LIKE A LITTLE BOX. LOOK AT THAT. THAT SHOOTING STRAIGHT UP THAT WALL RIGHT THERE, YOU SEE IT? ** THAT'S A PIPE. IS THAT WHAT THAT IS? IT'S KIND OF LIKE A... A LEAD JOINT ON IT. IT IS A LEAD JOINT. DADGUMMIT. PLASTER IS FALLING OFF THE INSIDE OF THE WALL. THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL WERE DETECTING. PULL THAT OUT. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. ** THAT'S DISAPPOINTING. WELL, IT WAS A LEAD WE HAD TO CHECK. IT NEEDED TO BE CHECKED. AH, SO CLOSE, BUT YET SO FAR. MAN. THERE'S NOTHING HERE, MAN. WE EXHAUSTED EVERYTHING IN HERE. YOU GOT EVERYTHING? YEP. ALL RIGHT. ** Narrator: NINE MILES AWAY, AT THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION, BRANT AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN GIVEN EXCLUSIVE PERMISSION TO SEARCH THE PROPERTY FOR THE $2 MILLION IN MISSING SILVER. ** THIS SITE WAS HOME TO ONE OF THE RICHEST FAMILIES IN THE SOUTH. THROUGHOUT THE WAR, THEY HOSTED THE CONFEDERATE ELITE ON THIS ONCE-BUSTLING PLANTATION. TODAY, IT IS STILL OWNED BY THE HAIRSTON FAMILY, WHO HAVE BEEN ITS CARETAKERS SINCE 1823. HEY, I WANT YOU ALL TO MEET MY COUSIN WILL. OKAY. NICE TO MEET YOU. WILL HAIRSTON. BRANT ARNOLD. BRANT, OKAY. NICE TO MEET YOU. Narrator: BOTH DEAN AND WILL HAVE DEEP TIES TO THIS PLANTATION. WILL'S ANCESTORS OWNED THE LAND. DEAN'S ANCESTORS WERE THE SLAVES THAT WORKED IT. THE HAIRSTON NAME IS SHARED BETWEEN THEM, AND TOGETHER, EACH SIDE HAS UNITED TO FORM A VERY UNIQUE FAMILY. WE CALL OURSELVES COUSINS BECAUSE THE DESCENDANTS FROM THE SLAVE OWNERS AND THE SLAVES NOW WE CELEBRATE AS ONE FAMILY. THAT'S NEAT. THAT'S VERY NEAT. Arnold: YOU ALL DEFINITELY GOT A LOT OF FAMILY HISTORY. YEAH. A LOT OF HISTORY GOES BACK ON THIS PROPERTY AND THE PEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE? Will: WELL, MY FAMILY'S HISTORY GOES BACK TO THE CONFEDERACY. OH! OH, MAN! Narrator: THESE CONFEDERATE WAR BONDS WERE USED BETWEEN 1861 AND 1865. PURCHASED FOR $1,000, THEY HELPED FUND THE WAR EFFORT. ONCE THE CONFEDERACY COLLAPSED, THE BONDS WERE WORTHLESS. TODAY, THEY CAN FETCH AS MUCH AS $4,000. ALL THE WEALTH THAT THE WHITE HAIRSTONS HAD IS DUE TO THE LABOR OF THE BLACK HAIRSTONS, SO WE HAVE A HUGE DEBT TO THEM. AND I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY ASK DEAN TO BE THE CARETAKER OF THIS. ALL RIGHT. [ CHATTER ] THANKS, WILL. THAT'S A HECK OF A GIFT. ONE OF THE BEST COUSINS EVER. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, I MEAN, WITH IT BEING FROM THE FAMILY, IT'S LIKE WE SAID. THAT'S A PRICELESS PIECE. Will: IT REALLY IS. Short: YOU READY TO DO IT, BRANT? I'VE BEEN READY. I COULDN'T SLEEP LAST NIGHT, I WAS SO READY. MAN, LOOK AT THIS. HOLLER AT ME IF YOU FIND SOMETHING, BROTHER. ALL RIGHT, BUD. GOOD LUCK. YOU, TOO. ** Narrator: THE PLANTATION ONCE OCCUPIED OVER 2,000 ACRES. IT'S NOW DOWN TO JUST 289. MOST OF THE BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY TIME, BUT THE SKELETON OF THE MAIN HOUSE IS STILL STANDING. FEW DETAILS ARE KNOWN ABOUT WHERE THE SILVER COINS WERE ACTUALLY FOUND... ONLY THAT IT WAS AROUND THIS NEARLY 200-YEAR-OLD RUIN. BRANT, TRACY, EARL, AND MIKE FAN OUT AROUND THE PERIMETER TO COVER MORE GROUND, INCREASING THEIR ODDS OF FINDING THIS TREASURE. TO FIND THIS GOLD, YOU NEED A LOT OF DIFFERENT PERSONALITIES, WAYS OF THINKING, AND JUST GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED SKILL. ** Narrator: SEVERAL YARDS TO THE SOUTH OF THE HOUSE, EARL HAS STUMBLED UPON A DEPRESSION IN THE GROUND THAT COULD EASILY BE PASSED OVER BY THE UNTRAINED EYE. THERE'S A LOT OF TARGETS IN HERE. Narrator: BUT EARL COMES FROM A TREASURE-HUNTING DYNASTY. HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN HUNTING FOR THE CONFEDERATE GOLD FOR THREE GENERATIONS. MY FATHER DONE IT. MY GRANDFATHER DONE IT. IT WAS SOMETHING I GREW UP WITH, AND THE REASON WHY I'M PASSING RELIC HUNTING IS TO TRY TO PRESERVE HISTORY, TO THINK OF ALL THE MEN THAT GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR A CAUSE. WHETHER IT WAS A GOOD CAUSE OR BAD CAUSE. BRANT, MIKE. SAY WHAT? COME ON OVER HERE. WE GOT AN ICE HOUSE WITH A LOT OF BIG TARGETS IN IT. Narrator: BEFORE REFRIGERATION BECAME WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE 1920s, ICE HOUSES WERE THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP GOODS COOL ALL YEAR ROUND. DEEP PITS WERE LINED WITH WOOD OR STRAW AND PACKED WITH ICE FROM LOCAL PONDS OR RIVERS. UNDERGROUND, THE ICE COULD THEN LAST THROUGH THE WARMER MONTHS UNTIL WINTER HIT AGAIN. Scott: EARL, I KNOW YOU DUG SOMETHING GOOD. WE GOT AN ICE HOUSE HERE. WHOLE LOT OF TRASH IN IT. Narrator: THE OLD ICE HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IDEAL SPOT FOR THE CONFEDERATES TO BURY 39 KEGS OF SILVER. Scott: PUT THE TREASURE IN THE BOTTOM, THROW A BUNCH OF TRASH ON TOP OF IT. WHO'S GOING TO LOOK THERE? Narrator: BUT THERE'S NO TELLING HOW DEEP THIS 150-YEAR-OLD PIT COULD BE. AVERAGE ICE HOUSE WAS 18 FEET DEEP. AND SHOVELS ARE NOT GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE HERE. AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY TO BRING IN THE BACKHOE. WE GET THE BACKHOE IN HERE, LET HIM START TAKING US DOWN THROUGH THE YEARS. IF THEY CAN SOMEHOW GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS PIT, THEY JUST MIGHT FIND THE LOST CONFEDERATE TREASURE. WE GOT IT. LET'S DO IT. COMING UP, AS BRANT'S TEAM GETS CLOSER TO THE SILVER, EGOS THREATEN TO TEAR THE TREASURE HUNTERS APART. WE MIGHT GET TO BREAKING SOMETHING. NO, BUT IF WE WIDEN OUT THE SIDES, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT ANYHOW. LAST DAMN THING I NEED IS SOME YANKEES TELLING ME HOW TO DO A JOB THAT I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO. AH. Narrator: LARRY AND HIS TEAM RELOCATE TO THE SAME SITE THAT BRANT STAKED OUT AND IMMEDIATELY STRIKE IT BIG. OH, MY GOD. ** WE GOT SOME TREASURE, BUDDY! ** Scott: I'M GLAD WE AIN'T LARRY RIGHT NOW. SHEW, CHECKING WALLS OF A MANSION. YEAH. YEAH, THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE MUCH FUN. I WONDER IF HE CHECKED BEHIND THE COMMODES THERE. [ LAUGHS ] YEAH, THEY MIGHT BE OUT THERE CHECKING THE YARD, THOUGH. YOU CAN'T NEVER TELL. THEY COULD BE DIGGING GOLD BARS OUT OF THE YARD. WE GOT TO GIVE HIM HELL, THOUGH. I'D RATHER BE HERE, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE GOT TO LOOK EVERYWHERE, SO IT'S A CHANCE IT'S THERE. I MET MY FIRST WIFE ON A TRAIL JUST LIKE THIS. WELL, YOU AIN'T BEEN MARRIED. I DIDN'T SAY WHO'S WIFE SHE WAS. [ LAUGHS ] ** Narrator: IN THE SEARCH FOR LOST CONFEDERATE SILVER, PAST TREASURE HUNTERS HAVE UNSUCCESSFULLY CONCENTRATED THEIR EFFORTS ON THE DAN RIVER AND THE NEARBY CEMETERY. NOW JUST NINE MILES WEST OF WHERE THE SILVER VANISHED, NEW CLUES HAVE LEAD A TEAM OF TREASURE HUNTERS TO THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION, WHERE THEY HAVE MADE A STARTLING DISCOVERY. Mesimer: I WAS HUNTING A WHILE AGO, COME ACROSS THIS HOLE. IT COULD BE A TRASH DUMP. IT COULD BE AN ICE HOUSE. ** IT'S PROBABLY 18 FEET DEEP, SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO DIG IT BY HAND. WE'D BE HERE A WEEK. ** Narrator: WITH DEPTHS REACHING OVER 25 FEET, AN ICE WELL WOULD HAVE BEEN THE QUICKEST AND EASIEST WAY TO HIDE THE KEGS OF SILVER THAT WENT MISSING IN DANVILLE. HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF SILVER COULD BE LYING AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PIT, USED FOR DECADES AS A DUMP, A TREASURE WORTH OVER $2 MILLION. WELL, MAYBE WE'LL DIG THIS UP AND HOPEFULLY GET A HONEY HOLE. IF WE START SEEING GLASS, WE'LL KNOW RIGHT AWAY. Narrator: IF THE RELICS IN THIS ICE WELL CAN BE DATED TO THE PERIOD WHEN THE SILVER VANISHED, THEY MAY HAVE SOLVED THIS 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY. GO DOWN A COUPLE MORE FEET. THEORY WE GOT WAS THAT THEY COULD'VE TOOK ICE AND BLOCKED IT IN AND PUT THE SILVER IN THE CENTER OF IT AND SET ICE ACROSS THE TOP OF IT, AND THE UNION ARMY NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT TO LOOK THERE. HOLD ON. HOLD ON FOR A SECOND. WHAT YOU GETTING DOWN THERE, BOYS? GLASS. Scott: WHAT IS THIS, 1920s? YEAH, IT AIN'T TIME YET, BOYS. WE NEED TO GO DOWN DEEPER. Short: IT'S BEEN FILLED IN WITH TRASH OVER THE YEARS. THERE'S A LOT OF MODERN STUFF ON TOP, BUT I'M REALLY HOPING WE GET DOWN IN THERE AND POSSIBLY FIND 39 KEGS OF SILVER. COME ON, BABY. COME ON, BABY. IF IT GETS OLDER, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FUN. [ LAUGHS ] OH, YEAH! STARTING TO SEE MORE GLASS, MAN. OH, BOTTLES! EARL, CHECK ON ALL THOSE BOTTLES UP ON IN THERE. GETTING OLDER AS WE GO. ** Narrator: AFTER STRIKING OUT AT THE SUTHERLIN MANSION, LARRY, PETE, AND DAN TRAVEL NINE MILES TO THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION. Eles: SUPPOSEDLY MEXICAN SILVER COINS FOUND HERE. WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME SNOOPING AROUND AND SEE WHAT WE COME UP WITH. WHILE BRANT'S TEAM CONTINUES TO DIG OUT THE ICE PIT, LARRY WANTS TO EXPLORE ANOTHER THEORY OF WHERE THE $2 MILLION OF SILVER COULD BE HIDDEN. PLANTATION OWNERS WILL HIDE THEY MONEY UNDER THE SLAVE QUARTERS FOR A LOT OF REASONS. SLAVES WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE MONEY. IF A SLAVE CAUGHT WITH MONEY, THEY'D KILL THEM. THE SLAVES WERE THE GUARDIANS OF THE TREASURE. COME ON, LET'S GO FIND SOME SILVER. I'D BE CAREFUL WITH THAT ONE. UH, UH, UH, UH. THAT THING'S GOT THAT THING... BEAM HOLDING IT UP. YEAH, I'D STAY ON THIS SIDE OF THAT. I WOULDN'T GO MESSING WITH THAT. GUYS, I'M JUST FIGURING OUT HOW SAFE IT IS. Narrator: LARRY TAKES THE LEAD. HIS GUIDANCE AND JUDGMENT ARE CRUCIAL, AS THEY'RE ABOUT TO ENTER AN ALL BUT DESTROYED PROPERTY WITH A NEARLY 200-YEAR-OLD ROOF THAT COULD COLLAPSE AT ANY MOMENT. IT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS. MM-HMM. YOU SURE YOU WANT TO BE DIGGING UNDER THAT? ABSOLUTELY. LET'S GO. Narrator: HE HAS EXCAVATED SLAVE QUARTERS AT OTHER PLANTATIONS AND HAS FOUND VALUABLE ARTIFACTS HIDDEN UNDER THE FLOORS. GOT DIRT FLOOR, IT LOOKS LIKE. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FLOOR. Cissna: THIS WAS ORIGINAL FLOOR BEAM. WHAT THEY DID, THEY LAID FLOOR, THE FLATS, ACROSS IT, AND YOU'D WALK ON WOODEN FLOOR. YOU WOULD HAVE A GAP IN IT ABOUT THIS BIG. IF YOU WERE GOING TO HIDE SILVER COINS, THIS IS WHERE YOU WOULD HIDE IT, UNDERNEATH THIS FLOOR. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT TYPE OF TREASURE HUNTING, OKAY? WE'RE EXCAVATING. WE'RE ARCHAEOLOGISTS. I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE IN MY LIFE THREE OR FOUR TIMES ON A COMPLEX THAT SIZE. THEREFORE, YOU KNOW, I KIND OF ASSIGN THEM THINGS TO DO AS A TEAM. PETE'S WORKING THE METAL DETECTOR. DAN AND I ARE BOTH DOING THE DIGGING. WHEN YOU HAVE A TEAM LIKE THAT, IT WORKS QUICK, FAST, AND EFFICIENT. ALL RIGHT, DAN. YEP. COME AND GET DOWN HERE AND LOOSEN THIS UP. WE'RE GOING TO PULL IT BACK, YEAH. OUR MAIN THING IS TO GET DOWN TO THE ORIGINAL FOUNDATION, ALL RIGHT? YOU ALL AIN'T OPPOSED TO GETTING DIRTY, I HOPE. [ LAUGHS ] ** [ METAL DETECTOR BUZZING ] ** Cissna: WHAT IS THAT? HOLD ON, STOP, LOOK AT THIS. NOW LOOK AT THIS PIECE OF BEAUTY. LOOK. Yarrusso: WHAT IS THAT? I SEE IT. OH, MAMA. ** OH, THAT'S GOT THE MAKER'S MARK. THERE'S A MAKER'S MARK ON THAT. SEE IT THERE? OH, THAT'S GOOD STUFF, PETE. GOOD LORD, HAVE MERCY. YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MAKER'S MARK OF CHINA FROM ABOUT 1840s, 1850s. YOU FIND THAT, YOU'RE IN IT. Narrator: A FIND, LIKE THIS PIECE OF EARLY-1800s POTTERY, IS VALUABLE FOR A FEW REASONS. IT TELLS THEM THERE ARE CIVIL WAR-PERIOD RELICS IN THE AREA, AND SOME OF THESE RELICS COULD'VE BEEN CONTAINERS FOR THE SILVER. THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE BEST CLUE TO ANY TREASURE HUNTER YOU COULD EVER COME ACROSS. IT TELLS ME THAT, "A," WE'RE IN THE RIGHT LOCATION, PRE-1865, AND NOBODY'S DUG HERE BEFORE. MAN, THAT'S AWESOME. ** Narrator: BACK AT THE ICE HOUSE, THE EXCAVATION CONTINUES, AND WITH EACH SCOOP OF EARTH, CLUES EMERGE THAT TAKE THE TEAM FURTHER BACK INTO HISTORY. WHAT'S THAT BOTTLE RIGHT THERE, MEDICINE BOTTLE? ** OLDER. WHAT'S THAT? I SAID IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GETTING A LITTLE OLDER. ** BLUE RIM. THAT'S USUALLY A SIGN YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE. YEAH. WE'RE STILL NOT OLD ENOUGH YET. WE'RE GETTING CLOSE, THOUGH. WE MIGHT, AT THIS BLACK SOIL RIGHT HERE, BE SCRATCHING THE TOP OF THE 1800s. COME ON, BABY. IT'S GETTING TO IT. BREAK INTO ANOTHER CENTURY. COULD YOU IMAGINE TAKING A BIG SCOOP OF SILVER COINS? [ CHUCKLES ] THIS COULD BE IT. THIS COULD BE IT. TODAY'S THE DAY. TODAY IS THE DAY. GET UP OUT OF THERE, NOW. COME ON. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'D THAT HIT? WHAT DID THAT JUST HIT, IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] HOLD IT. ** Narrator: ON THE RUINS OF A ONCE-PROSPEROUS TOBACCO PLANTATION, BRANT AND HIS TEAM OF TREASURE HUNTERS ARE TUNNELING THROUGH 150 YEARS OF DIRT AND DEBRIS. ** AS THEY GO DEEPER INTO THE GROUND, THEY UNCOVER OLDER AND OLDER RELICS THAT UNRAVEL THE PLANTATION'S HISTORY, BUT THEY'VE GOT THEIR EYES ON THE PRIZE... THE MISSING 39 KEGS OF SILVER FROM THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE. GET UP OUT OF THERE, NOW. COME ON. ALL RIGHT, WHAT'D THAT HIT? WHAT DID THAT JUST HIT, IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] HOLD IT. COULD THEY HAVE HIT THE JACKPOT? AND IT IS PERIOD. YES! Arnold: IT IS PERIOD. SURE ENOUGH IS. THAT IS IT. THAT'S WHAT WE LOOKING FOR. YEAH, WE GOT CIVIL WAR GLASS RIGHT HERE. YES, SIR. THAT'S WHAT WE LOOKING FOR. HERE, YOU HOLD ONTO IT. THAT'S... THAT'S IT RIGHT THERE. THAT GREEN GLASS, OLD BOTTLE. LOOK AT THAT BOTTLE. LOOK HOW IT'S BLOWN IN THE SIDES. NOW, THIS GETS ME REALLY EXCITED BECAUSE THIS MEANS WE'RE IN THE RIGHT LEVEL. Narrator: THOUGH IT'S NOT THE TREASURE ITSELF, FINDING CIVIL WAR-PERIOD BOTTLES TELLS THEM THEY ARE LOOKING IN THE RIGHT AREA. THIS ICE HOUSE WAS DEFINITELY USED DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND MAY HOLD THE ANSWERS TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST SECRETS IN AMERICAN HISTORY. SHOULD WE HAVE HIM WIDEN THE WHOLE THING OUT DOWN TO THAT LEVEL FIRST? I'M AFRAID WE MIGHT GET TO BREAKING SOMETHING. NO, BUT IF WE WIDEN OUT THE SIDES, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO THAT ANYHOW. YEAH. BRANT. HOLD ON, MAN. LET'S GET UP OUT OF THERE. WE ONLY GOT ABOUT AN HOUR OF DAYLIGHT LEFT. YEAH, BUT WHAT IF WE BREAK A BUNCH OF STUFF? Scott: I'D LIKE TO HAVE PEOPLE RESPECT MY OPINION A LITTLE BIT MORE. I'VE BEEN ON SOME PRETTY BIG TREASURE HUNTS ALL AROUND THE WORLD. I'M USED TO DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY PROFESSIONAL. BRANT JUST PISSES ME OFF. YOU'RE ALREADY DOWN FAR... FAR. LET'S TAKE SOME MORE SCOOPS. GET OUT OF THERE, WIDEN IT OUT. I'M NOT GOING NOWHERE. [BLEEP] ** COME ON, BRANT. WE ONLY GOT A LITTLE BIT OF DAYLIGHT LEFT. GIVE ME FIVE [BLEEP] MINUTES HERE WITH NOBODY BOTHERING ME, AND I FIND [BLEEP] [ SIGHS ] WE'RE NEVER GOING TO FIND IT LIKE THIS. BRANT. LET'S TAKE A COUPLE MORE SCOOPS. I'M TRYING TO SEE HOW LOW I CAN TELL HIM TO GO WITHOUT BREAKING STUFF. WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF BREAKING STUFF. WE'RE IN THE HOLE WORKING OUR ASS OFF, AND THE LAST DAMN THING I NEED IS SOME YANKEE STANDING ON TOP OF THE HILL TELLING ME HOW TO DO A JOB THAT I ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO. MIKE NEEDS TO CALM THE [BLEEP] DOWN. WHOA, GINGER BEER BOTTLE. GINGER BEER... IS IT WHOLE? IT'S THE NECK OF ONE. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING. THAT'S [BLEEP] WE'RE GOING TO BREAK IF WE KEEP DIGGING. YEAH, BUT WE GOT THE BACKHOE. LET'S TAKE A COUPLE MORE SCOOPS. BOTTLES ARE FUN, BUT I WANT SILVER. [ GROANS ] ** ALL I HEAR FROM EVERYBODY IS, "WE SHOULD DO IT THIS WAY. WE SHOULD DO IT THAT WAY." BICKER, BICKER, BICKER. YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT, I'M ABOUT SICK OF BEING SECOND-GUESSED. UNTIL YOU WALK IN AND HAND ME A GOLD COIN, I DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR [BLEEP] ** Narrator: ACROSS THE PLANTATION GROUNDS, AT THE SLAVE QUARTERS, LARRY, DAN, AND PETE HAVE UNEARTHED CIVIL WAR-PERIOD CHINA... SIGNS THAT THEY COULD BE GETTING CLOSER TO THE TREASURE. ALL THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE TELLS US WE'RE IN THE RIGHT PERIOD, AND NOBODY'S TOUCHED THIS AREA AT ALL. NO TELLING WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE NEXT, AND GETTING REAL EXCITING HERE. Yarrusso: I'M LIKE A KID IN A CANDY STORE RIGHT NOW, FELLAS. SEE, MY HAND'S SHAKING ON THIS SHOVEL. [ LAUGHTER ] I LOVE THIS, MAN. GETTING ANOTHER LITTLE PIECE. [ METAL DETECTOR BUZZING ] OH, MY GOD. WHOA, WHOA. HOLY CRAP, WE GOT A COIN. OH, WE GOT A COIN. WE GOT A COIN. WE GOT A COIN. WE GOT A COIN. NOW, I'M GOING TO TELL YOU SOMETHING... THAT COULD BE FROM PART OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. ** OH, THAT IS... THAT IS JUST INCREDIBLE. LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS COIN. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH THE PENNY IS A VALUABLE RELIC IN ITSELF, PENNIES WERE NOT PART OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE BELIEVED TO BE HIDDEN IN DANVILLE. LET ME PICK ON IT A LITTLE BIT AND SEE IF I CAN SEE SOMETHING. Cissna: NO, HOLD ON. PUT THAT DOWN. PETE, PETE. I JUST WANT TO SEE IF I CAN TELL WHAT IT IS. PETE, WE GOT MORE TO LOOK FOR. THAT IS A PENNY. WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE BIG, SILVER COINS. COME ON, MAN. WE'RE PROBABLY A JAR AWAY FROM THE WHOLE THING. I CAN SEE... HEY, THIS IS LARGE CENT. I CAN SEE THE STARS AROUND IT... OKAY, THEN LET IT BE. SO I KNOW IT'S A LARGE CENT. LET IT BE. Cissna: THESE GUYS... IF THEY DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY HERE TO REIN THEM IN, THEY'LL SIT THERE, AND THEY'LL RUB THAT PENNY SO LONG, THEY'LL RUB IT SHINY. I MEAN, YOU GOT TO KEEP THEM FOCUSED. I WANT FREAKING SILVER, BIG SILVER. Yarrusso: LET'S GO. ** [ METAL DETECTOR BUZZING ] ** THAT SIDE OVER THERE. IT'S THAT BIG GROUP. DO IT AGAIN. OH, IT'S A SILVER COIN! OH. SILVER COIN. I SWEAR TO GOD. I SWEAR. NO WAY. IT IS A SILVER QUARTER. OH, NO [BLEEP] WAY RIGHT THERE. I'M LOOKING AT IT. THIS ONE RIGHT HERE, YEAH. RIGHT THERE. AIN'T A QUARTER. PETE. [BLEEP] IT'S A PRETTY ONE, THOUGH. DANG, I THOUGHT IT WAS QUARTER. THROW IT UP HERE AND SEE WHAT IT IS. PROBABLY ANOTHER BUTTON. OH! OH! SILVER COIN, ISN'T IT? ISN'T IT? YES, IT IS. IT AIN'T SILVER. [BLEEP] THAT'S A BUST DIME. NO WAY. LOOK AT IT, 1823 DIME. WHOO! I THINK WE FOUND IT. ** Narrator: ON THE NEXT "REBEL GOLD," BOTH TEAMS INCH CLOSER TO FINDING OUT IF THE LOST TREASURE LIES BENEATH THE GROUND AT THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION. THIS COULD BE IT. WITH THE TREASURE CLOSER THAN EVER, TENSIONS RUN HIGH BETWEEN TEAM MEMBERS... YOU GAVE ME NO LOVE, AND YOU HAVE BEEN HOLDING UP THE BUILDING ALL DAY. ...AS THE PROSPECT OF BEING THE FIRST TO DISCOVER THE MISSING CONFEDERATE TREASURE BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE A REALITY... Scott: WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE BURIED TREASURE, MAKE OUR PLACE IN HISTORY. Narrator: ...WILL THEY PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE TO WORK TOWARDS THEIR COMMON GOAL... [ LAUGHS ] DUDE, THAT IS AWESOME! ...OR LET GREED PIT EVERY MAN AGAINST THE OTHER? WE'RE CALLING IT QUITS, AND THEY'RE OVER THERE DOING THE HAPPY DANCE. HOLD UP, HOLD UP, HOLD UP, HOLD UP. THAT IS IT. YEAH! WHOO!
