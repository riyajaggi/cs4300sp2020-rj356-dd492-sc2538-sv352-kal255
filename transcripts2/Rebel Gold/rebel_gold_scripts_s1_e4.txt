 IT'S ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING TREASURE STORIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY.

 CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT AND HIS LOST RICHES. Larry: WE GOTTA PUSH HARDER THAN WE'VE PUSHED YET. I MEAN, NOBODY'S GOTTEN THIS FAR. Narrator: WHILE ANOTHER TEAM OF HUNTERS... BRANT, MIKE, TRACY, AND EARL... INVESTIGATE A 150-YEAR-OLD CRIME SCENE THAT COULD LEAD TO THOUSANDS OF GOLD COINS WORTH OVER $13 MILLION. YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH JUST ANY GOLD COIN. IF ONE COIN WOULD BRING $3,000 AND YOU DIG 30 COINS FROM THAT ONE SPOT, THAT'S A MOTHER LODE. Narrator: TWO TEAMS WITH TWO STRONG LEADERS... SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRAIL. YEAH. WHOO! THERE COULD BE $20 MILLION IN GOLD LAYIN' OUT THERE. HOW YOU GONNA GET IT IF YOU DON'T GET IN THE WATER? WE IN BUSINESS! CRANK HER UP, BABY. Narrator: ...HUNT OFF THE BEATEN PATH... ALL THE BLOOD, ALL THE SWEAT, ALL THE TEARS PINNED DOWN TO THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE. Narrator: ...CHASING DOWN CLUES THAT JUST MIGHT FINALLY LEAD TO THE LOST REBEL GOLD. STAY WITH ME. I'LL LEAD YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, TWO ACCOMPLISHED TREASURE HUNTERS BELIEVE THEY'RE ABOUT TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF A LIFETIME. LARRY CISSNA, A NATIVE TEXAN, HAS BEEN HUNTING THE LOST REBEL GOLD FOR 32 YEARS. HE'S DETERMINED TO GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS THE MAN WHO FINALLY UNEARTHED IT. IN MY WORLD, THE RUNNER-UP IS THE FIRST LOSER. IF YOU'RE INCAPABLE OF FINDIN' THE CLUES, YOU'RE GONNA BE THE FIRST RUNNER-UP. Narrator: WITH THE CIVIL WAR COMING TO AN ABRUPT END, LARRY BELIEVES JEFFERSON DAVIS LEFT A PORTION OF THE TREASURE WITH PEOPLE HE TRUSTED BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND HIS CAPTURE SITE IN IRWINVILLE. THIS TRAIL WE'RE ON, NOT MANY PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THIS. I HAVE READ ON THIS AND READ ON THIS. AND I CUT OUT ALL THE BULL CRAP. AND THIS IS WHAT I CAME UP WITH AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL FOLLOW. Narrator: TENNESSEE-BORN BRANT ARNOLD HAS TAKEN A DIFFERENT PATH. HAVING BEEN OBSESSED WITH THE LOST CONFEDERATE GOLD FOR ALMOST TWO DECADES, HIS THEORY HAS LED HIM TO WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, WHERE A PORTION OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE DISAPPEARED IN A MYSTERIOUS TURN OF EVENTS. FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTIN' DAMN CLOSE. WE JUST GOTTA GET OUR FEET ON THE RIGHT PROPERTY. Narrator: MAY 5, 1865... JEFFERSON DAVIS AND HIS CABINET ARRIVE IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, THE LAST STOP FOR THE CONFEDERATE MONEY TRAIN. DESPERATE TO STAY AHEAD OF THE UNION ARMY HOT ON THEIR TRAIL, THEY LEAVE A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF CONFEDERATE GOLD AT THE LOCAL BANK AND FLEE TOWN. WITHIN DAYS, THE UNION ARMY CONFISCATES THE FUNDS, LOADS IN ONTO WAGONS, AND SENDS IT BACK TO RICHMOND UNDER ARMED GUARD. BUT THE GOLD NEVER MADE IT OUT OF GEORGIA. BEFORE IT EVEN GOT OUT OF WASHINGTON, A GROUP OF UNKNOWN ASSAILANTS ATTACK THE WAGONS AND MAKE OFF WITH MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE, A BOUNTY THAT IS TODAY WORTH $13 MILLION AND IS STILL MISSING. THE CULPRITS BEHIND THE RAID HAVE NEVER BEEN IDENTIFIED. BUT BRANT BELIEVES THE MEN WHO STOLE THE MONEY WERE ACTUALLY 20 CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS FROM THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY INTENT ON TAKING BACK WHAT WAS THEIRS. LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT THAT MAPS. Narrator: TO PROVE HIS THEORY AND FIND THE 13 MILLION IN GOLD, BRANT AND HIS TEAM, TRACY SHORT, EARL MESSIMER, AND MIKE SCOTT ARE ON A MISSION TO FIND OUT WHERE THE HISTORIC ROBBERY TOOK PLACE. THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED JUST BY FINDIN' THAT EXACT LOCATION. WHICH WAY THE TREASURE WENT, HOW THE TREASURE WENT, WHO TOOK THE TREASURE. Narrator: FOR 150 YEARS, HISTORY PLACED THE SCENE OF THE CRIME AT THE CHENNAULT PLANTATION. BUT NEW RESEARCH POINTS BRANT AND TEAM TO THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE. WHILE THE EXACT LOCATION OF THIS HOUSE HAS BEEN LOST TO HISTORY, RECORDS SUGGEST IT WAS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO OLD HOMESITES, THE JOHN MOSS PLANTATION AND WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE LEESTON HOUSE. TODAY, THE LEESTON HOUSE NO LONGER EXISTS. BUT BRANT KNOWS IT WAS SOMEWHERE IN THIS VICINITY. YEAH, WE'LL BE CLOSE TO THE LEESTON PROPERTY. Narrator: TO FIND THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE, BRANT AND HIS TEAM MUST FIRST FIND THE LEESTON HOUSE. FIND THAT HOUSE, WE KNOW WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. THAT'S IT. LET'S ROLL WITH IT. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: THE TEAM HUNTS FOR ANY EVIDENCE OF THE 1860s HOME. HEY, TRACY. YEAH? I-I SEE SOME LARGE LIVE OAKS. AND THAT IS A SIGN OF A HOUSE SITE. I AGREE TOTALLY. WE NEED TO GET ALL THE GUYS TOGETHER. BRANT, MIKE, COME ON OVER HERE. THIS ROW OF OAK TREES APPEARS OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE STOOD DURING THE CIVIL WAR AND COULD'VE LINED THE PRIVATE ROAD. IT TELLS THE EXPERIENCED TREASURE HUNTERS TO LOOK FOR A HOMESITE WHERE THE LINE OF OLD TREES END. THERE'S A WELL. YOU GUYS WANNA LIFT THIS OFF AND LOOK AT IT? YEAH, SURE, WHY NOT? COULD BE FULL OF GOLD COINS. DON'T FALL IN THERE, BOYS. [BLEEP] HAVE TROUBLE GETTIN' YOU BACK OUT. WELL, IT'S NOT BRICK-LINED. IS IT BRICK? NO, IT'S JUST HAND-DUG WELL. WE CAN'T REALLY TELL THE AGE OF IT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ROCK OR BRICK-LINED. BUT WE DO KNOW IT'S A HAND-DUG WELL. AND, UH, SO THAT'S, YOU KNOW, PUTS... KNOWS... LET US KNOW WE'RE IN THE AREA. Narrator: WHERE THERE'S A WELL, THERE'S USUALLY A HOMESITE. THE TEAM SETS OUT FOR MORE CLUES. I THINK RIGHT THERE IS AN OLD CHIMNEY IN THERE. Narrator: THE DISCOVERY COULD BE THE REMAINS OF THE LEESTON HOME. ROCK HERE, ANOTHER ROCK THERE, ANOTHER ROCK THERE. Narrator: IF THE TREASURE HUNTERS CAN FIND ANY SCRAPS OF METAL TO DATE THE HOUSE BACK TO THE CIVIL WAR, THEY'RE ONE STEP CLOSER TO FINDING THE GOLD. WE'RE HOPING THIS IS THE LEESTON HOUSE. 'CAUSE IF IT'S THE LEESTON HOUSE, WE CAN FIND THE MOSS HOUSE WHERE THE ROBBERY ACTUALLY OCCURRED. THIS IS VERY, VERY VIABLE TO FIND WHERE THE TREASURE COME FROM. WE CANNOT LEAVE THIS AREA TILL WE SOLVE THIS 150-YEAR-OLD RIDDLE. Narrator: MEANWHILE, DEEP IN THE HEART OF GEORGIA, LARRY, PETE, AND DAN ARE HEADING TO THE NEXT SPOT ON JEFFERSON DAVIS' TRAIL... DUBLIN, GEORGIA, WHERE DAVIS AND HIS MEN CROSSED THE OCONEE RIVER JUST 3 DAYS BEFORE HE WAS CAPTURED IN IRWINVILLE. WE GOTTA PUSH HARDER THAN WE'VE PUSHED YET. THIS ALL COMES TO A HEAD WHERE HE GOT CAUGHT. Narrator: ON MAY 7, 1865, THE DAY THAT DAVIS CROSSED THE OCONEE, THERE WAS NO BRIDGE. SOME TRAVELERS SWAM ACROSS THE SWIFT MOVING RIVER OR CROSSED ON HORSEBACK. OTHERS PAID UP TO 50 CENTS TO TAKE A FERRY, A SIMPLE FLOATING PLATFORM THAT FERRYMEN USED TO CROSS THE TREACHEROUS RIVER WITH ONLY ROPES AND PULLEYS. DURING THE CIVIL WAR, THE OCONEE FERRY WAS A CRITICAL MEANS OF TRANSPORTATION. BUT TODAY, IT'S LONG GONE. I TALKED TO SOME LOCALS. AND THEY TOLD US ABOUT WHERE THEY BELIEVE THIS CROSSING WAS. Narrator: LARRY BELIEVES DAVIS KNEW HIS CAPTURE WAS IMMINENT AND MAY HAVE CHOSEN TO UNLOAD SOME OF HIS TREASURE AT THE FERRY CROSSING TO KEEP IT FROM FALLING INTO ENEMY HANDS. THAT'S DEFINITELY A ROADBED RIGHT THROUGH HERE. YOU CAN SEE IT. WELL, LET'S... LET'S HUNT, MAN. I WANNA HUNT. [ BEEPING ] Narrator: THE TEAM BEGINS ITS SEARCH FOR ANY EVIDENCE THAT DAVIS AND HIS TROOPS WERE IN THE AREA. I HEAR IRON IN HERE. I GOT SOMETHIN' RIGHT HERE THAT SOUNDS LIKE IRON. OH, [BLEEP]. LARRY. HEY. COME HERE AND LOOK AT THIS. OH, I KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S PART OF A BRIDLE BIT. WELL, THAT'S A GOOD CLUE. Narrator: THIS PIECE OF HORSE BRIDLE FROM THE 1800s TELLS THE TEAM THEY'VE MOST LIKELY HIT UPON THE WAGON TRAIL THEY'RE LOOKING FOR. WE'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT. IT'S JUST ONE. WE NEED TO FIND A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT. PETE'S THE KINDA GUY THAT COULD GO TO A SUPERMARKET PARKIN' LOT AND FIND A CONFEDERATE BUTTON. SOME HORSE TACK, WAGON PARTS, THINGS LIKE THAT, THOSE ARE GREAT SIGNS THAT THEY WERE IN THE VICINITY. THERE'S ANOTHER SIGNAL RIGHT THERE. THAT AIN'T IRON, MO. ROOTS IN HERE, BOY. [ BEEPING ] GOT IT NOW, WHATEVER IT IS. THAT'S A... I KNOW WHAT THAT IS. THAT'S A... THAT'S A... THAT'S A GUIDE TO THE REINS ON A WAGON. EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. REAL FANCY. Narrator: HARDWARE FROM AN OLD WAGON IS ANOTHER GOOD SIGN. THE FACT THAT IT'S ORNATE SUGGESTS A HIGH-RANKING OFFICIAL ONCE TRAVELED THIS VERY ROAD. [ BEEPING ] GOT ANOTHER IRON HIT. OH, HELL, I KNOW WHAT THAT IS. WHAT? IT WENT ON A BOX. LEMME SEE THAT. THIS IS SERIOUS STUFF RIGHT HERE, GUYS. Narrator: THIS HANDLE IS THE MOST PROMISING SIGN SO FAR. IT COULD BE FROM A BOX THAT HELD MILLIONS IN GOLD COINS. HERE'S OUR FORENSIC EVIDENCE RIGHT HERE. HORSE TACK, WE GOT WAGON TACK AND WE GOT A BOX TACK, RIGHT? I PROMISE YOU, BRANT AND THEM, THEY AIN'T INTO THIS. HELL, NO. THEY CHASIN' SOME DADGUM FICTIONAL STORY OVER THERE, AIN'T GONNA LEAD 'EM TO NOTHIN'. NOW, LOOK, IT DON'T GET NO BETTER THAN THIS. NO, NOT... THIS RIGHT HERE ACTUALLY SENT CHILLS UP YOUR SPINE. Narrator: COMING UP, LARRY AND HIS TEAM TAKE ON A SNAKE AND GATOR-INFESTED SWAMP. THERE COULD BE $20 MILLION IN GOLD LAYIN' OUT THERE. WHOO! WE IN BUSINESS! WOW, LOOK AT THIS! [ SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY ] Narrator: WHILE BIG FINDS... GOT A PIECE OFF A HORSE BIT. I GOT AN OLD HORSESHOE HERE. I FOUND THE ORIGINAL ROADBED. Narrator: ...LEAD BRANT AND HIS TEAM CLOSER TO A 150-YEAR-OLD CRIME SCENE. ONCE WE FIND THIS PLACE, WE'LL HAVE SOLVED THE MYSTERY OF WHERE THIS ROBBERY REALLY TOOK PLACE. ** ** Narrator: IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, TREASURE HUNTERS BRANT ARNOLD, MIKE SCOTT, TRACY SHORT, AND EARL MESSIMER ARE ON THE SEARCH FOR THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE, WHERE A HIGH-STAKES ROBBERY TOOK PLACE OVER 150 YEARS AGO IN THE FINAL HOURS OF THE CIVIL WAR. IF THEY FIND IT, IT COULD LEAD THEM TO MILLIONS IN MISSING CONFEDERATE GOLD. WHILE NO ONE KNOWS THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE, RECENTLY UNCOVERED RESEARCH PLACES THE SITE OF THE INFAMOUS ROBBERY OF $13 MILLION IN GOLD BETWEEN TWO COORDINATES... THE JOHN MOSS PLANTATION, STILL STANDING TODAY, AND THE LEESTON HOME, THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LOST TO HISTORY UNTIL NOW. THE TEAM HAS JUST DISCOVERED WHAT THEY BELIEVE ARE THE REMAINS OF THE LEESTON HOUSE. TO KNOW FOR CERTAIN, THEY'RE LOOKING FOR RELICS DATING BACK TO THE CIVIL WAR TO ENSURE THE TIME PERIOD IS A MATCH. THERE'S A BUNCH OF IRON IN HERE. FINDING A LOT OF IRON TELLS US THAT THERE'S HUMAN OCCUPATION THERE. AND THEN YOU CAN DIG THE IRON UP, TELL HOW OLD IT IS. SQUARE NAIL, PERIOD. Narrator: FOR THE TEAM, FINDING NAILS DATING BACK TO THE CIVIL WAR ALONG WITH A WELL AND CHIMNEY IN THE SUSPECTED LOCALE OF THE LEESTON HOME ARE CLUES THAT ADD UP TO VICTORY. SO I'D HAVE TO SAY WE'RE AT THE LOCATION WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR. WE'VE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS PROPERTY WAS OWNED BY THE LEESTON FAMILY. AND I BELIEVE WE'RE ON A HOT TRAIL. PRETTY COCKY ON IT RIGHT NOW. Narrator: WITH THE LOCATION OF BOTH CIVIL WAR-ERA HOMES CONFIRMED, THE TEAM CAN NOW FOCUS ON THE LAND IN BETWEEN. THEIR TARGET... THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE, THE SITE OF THE CIVIL WAR ROBBERY, SOMEWHERE WITHIN THIS PERIMETER. OH, GUYS, I FOUND THE ORIGINAL ROADBED. OKAY. IT'S 10, 15 FEET DEEP IN PLACES. OH, HELL. YEAH, IT'S A GOOD ONE. Narrator: 150 YEARS AGO, HOUSES WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. BUT USUALLY, THEY SHARED ONE ROAD. THIS OLD DIRT TRAIL COULD BE A DIRECT PATH TO THE MISSING TREASURE. AND THE MOSS HOUSE COULD BE ON UP THE ROAD. 'CAUSE YOU GOTTA THINK, WE GOT STARTED AT THE LEESTON HOUSE TO FIND THE MOSS HOUSE. YEAH. AND ONCE AGAIN, THIS BOILS DOWN TO LARRY CISSNA IS RUNNIN' AROUND PLAYIN' PIN THE TAIL ON THE DONKEY, GOIN' FROM SITE TO SITE TO SITE, TRYIN' TO LOCATE STUFF. WHY RUN AROUND LIKE A CHICKEN WITH YOUR HEAD CUT OFF WHEN YOU CAN COME TO WHERE THE STUFF'S SUPPOSED TO BE? Narrator: BACK DOWN SOUTH IN DUBLIN, GEORGIA, LARRY, PETE, AND DAN CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF JEFFERSON DAVIS. THEY'RE HUNTING AN OLD WAGON TRAIL WHERE THEY BELIEVE DAVIS MAY HAVE STASHED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF TREASURE AFTER CROSSING THE OCONEE RIVER. THEY'VE ALREADY FOUND EVIDENCE THAT CONFEDERATE TROOPS WERE IN THE AREA. NOW A STEADY LINE OF IRON HITS LEAD THE GUYS STRAIGHT TO THE EDGE OF THE SWAMP. BUT EVEN UNDER WATER, THE DISCOVERIES CONTINUE. RIGHT THERE, DAN. SEE WHAT IT IS. OH, HELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS? WHAT? THAT'S A DAMN POWDER'S FLASK. DAMN SURE IS. LOOK AT THAT. Narrator: SOLDIERS USED THIS CIVIL WAR-ERA POWDER FLASK TO CARRY GUNPOWDER FOR THEIR PISTOLS. IT IS YET MORE PROOF THAT SOLDIERS ONCE TRAVELED ON THIS VERY GROUND. I MEAN, ANYBODY CARRIED A POWDER FLASK. IT COULD'VE BEEN JEFF DAVIS HIMSELF. THE REST OF THAT IS OUT THERE. Narrator: THE OLD WAGON TRAIL CONTINUES BENEATH THE SWAMP. WHEN YOU RUN INTO A OBSTACLE LIKE THIS, YOU NEED A DREDGE. Narrator: WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING TREASURE UNDERWATER, A DREDGE IS THE ONLY WAY TO GO. ONCE A TARGET IS LOCATED UNDERWATER, A HIGH-POWER PUMP SUCKS UP THE OBJECT ALONG WITH WATER, SILT, AND ROCKS, SENDING IT THROUGH A HOSE AND SPITTING IT INTO A SLUICE BOX, WHERE IT IS THEN SORTED AND IDENTIFIED. IF THERE'S ANYTHING DOWN THERE, THIS... THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT HERE IS SURELY GONNA BRING IT UP. THERE'S ALLIGATORS OUT HERE. UM, THERE'S... THERE'S WATER MOCCASINS. THERE'S RATTLESNAKES. THERE MAY EVEN BE LEECHES IN THERE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT THERE COULD BE $20 MILLION IN GOLD LAYIN' OUT THERE. HOW YOU GONNA GET IT IF YOU DON'T GET IN THE WATER? WHOO, SON. OH, CR... OH, MY... OH. WHOO. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] OH, OH, OH, THERE'S SENSITIVE PARTS. Narrator: THE TEAM IS HOPING TO STRIKE GOLD UNDERWATER OR AT LEAST UNCOVER MORE CLUES TO HELP THEM PINPOINT DAVIS' EXACT ROUTE. [ ENGINE REVS ] I TURN MY HAT BACKWARDS. WE'RE GETTIN' SERIOUS BUSINESS RIGHT THERE NOW. [ SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY ] LOOK AT THAT [BLEEP] RIGHT THERE, BOYS. WHOO! WE IN BUSINESS! CRANK HER UP, BABY! ALL RIGHT. WHOO! YEAH! Narrator: WHILE PETE LISTENS FOR SIGNS OF METAL WITH THE DETECTOR, LARRY GUIDES THE SUCTION HOSE. DAN HELMS THE SLUICE BOX, KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR GOLD OR ANYTHING THE CONFEDERATES MAY HAVE DROPPED ON THEIR WAY SOUTH. THIS IS WHERE THREE PEOPLE, THEY'RE ALL GOOD IN CERTAIN AREAS, IT COMES TOGETHER, IT'S CALLED THE "A" TEAM. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS THING? THIS THING OUGHT TO BE PUMPIN' WATER, BO. Narrator: JUST A FEW MINUTES INTO THEIR SWAMP SEARCH, THE EQUIPMENT THE TEAM IS RELYING ON TO COMPLETE THEIR MISSION BEGINS TO FAIL. WE GOT NOTHIN'. WE DON'T GOT NO SUCKIN'. WHAT THE [BLEEP] IS GOIN' ON? Y'ALL GOT THIS RIGHT? THERE'S NO SUCKING GOING ON WITH OUR DREDGE. AND WHEN WE HAVE NO SUCKING, WE ARE GONNA FIND NO GOLD. Narrator: COMING UP, MECHANICAL FAILURE THREATENS TO SHUT DOWN LARRY'S DESPERATE HUNT FOR THE LOST REBEL GOLD. WE REALLY HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE. I WANNA FIND ME GOLD. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO NEED TO STOP NOW. I MEAN, NOBODY'S GOTTEN THIS FAR. Narrator: WHILE BRANT AND HIS TEAM CLOSE IN ON THE INFAMOUS ROBBERY SITE. BRANT, I TH... I THINK THIS COULD BE THE PLACE, MAN. Narrator: UNEXPECTED FINDS THREATEN TO TEAR HIS THEORY APART. PRETTY WEIRD WE'RE FINDING EAGLE BUTTONS IN HERE INSTEAD OF CONFEDERATE BUTTONS. ALL THE HEARTBREAK, ALL THE BLOOD, ALL THE SWEAT, ALL THE TEARS PINNED DOWN TO THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE. ** ** Narrator: 18 MILES NORTHEAST OF WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, BRANT AND HIS FELLOW TREASURE HUNTERS CONTINUE TO TRACK AN OLD ROADBED TO FIND THE LONG LOST DAVID MOSS HOUSE. HERE IT IS SAID THAT A GROUP OF UNKNOWN BANDITS HELD UP A UNION ARMY CARAVAN FULL OF TREASURE, MAKING OFF WITH THOUSANDS OF CONFEDERATE GOLD COINS THAT WOULD BE WORTH UP TO $13 MILLION TODAY. WE FINALLY GOT ON THIS TRAIL. WE COME OUT HERE AND WALKED OUT IN THE WOODS. AND I KNOW IT'S OUT HERE. I'VE JUST GOTTA GET ON IT. Narrator: TO FIND ANY TREASURE, BRANT AND HIS TEAM FIRST HAVE TO FIND THE LOCATION WHERE THE CRIME TOOK PLACE... A HOMESTEAD THAT HAS SEEMINGLY VANISHED. WELL, WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SEE WHERE IT IS 'CAUSE THIS AREA'S ALL BEEN LOGGED. OH, IT'S BEEN LOGGED. BOYS, I DON'T SEE NO ROAD OVER HERE. Narrator: WHEN THE 200-YEAR-OLD ROADBED VANISHES, THE TREASURE HUNTERS LOSE THE TRAIL THEY HOPED WOULD LEAD THEM TO THE MISSING DAVID MOSS HOUSE. THEY'VE ERASED WHAT WE COULD SEE OF THE ROADBED FROM OVER THERE TO OVER HERE. SO ALL WE CAN DO IS KEEP FOLLOWING THE ANGLE OF THAT ROADBED AND SEE IF WE CAN RUN INTO ANOTHER ONE OR A HOMESITE UP THIS WAY. Narrator: AS THE TEAM HITS YET ANOTHER DEAD END, BRANT'S LEADERSHIP IS CALLED INTO QUESTION. I THINK THE BEST WAY TO DO IT, SPIRAL OUT. NO. JUST START SPIRALIN' OUT. ALL OF US. I'M GOIN' THIS WAY. ANY OTHER SUGGESTIONS? NO. NO. MIKE'S BEEN TRYIN' TO SECOND GUESS EVERY SINGLE THING. I'LL DOZE CLEAN OVER HIM AND PUSH FORWARD WITH HIM OR WITHOUT HIM. SO TWO OF US'LL GO AROUND THIS SIDE OF THE SPARSE SIDE, WRAP AROUND. TWO GO THIS WAY. I'M GOIN' THIS WAY. WHICH WAY YOU GOIN', TRACY? I'M GOIN' WITH YOU, MIKE. ALL RIGHT. MIKEY. LET'S GO GET IT, BUD. BRANT'S HARDHEADED. SOMETIMES I JUST GET FED UP WITH IT. IT... IT... YOU TELL HIM ONE THING. AND IF HE'S GOT IT IN HIS HEAD IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY, BRANT AIN'T GOIN' TO LISTEN TO YOU. HE'S UNASSESSED, HONESTLY. THINKS HE'S TOO GOOD FOR THE REST OF US. WE... WE BEEN CALLIN' HIM, "JUNIOR." [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: THEY SPLIT UP TO COVER MORE GROUND, EACH LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE THAT THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE ONCE STOOD IN THESE WOODS. IF WE DON'T FIND THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE SOON, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BACK UP AND REGROUP BIG TIME. Narrator: AT THE OCONEE RIVER IN DUBLIN, GEORGIA, LARRY CISSNA AND HIS TEAM ARE HUNTING DOWN TREASURE THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS COULD'VE HIDDEN 150 YEARS AGO BEFORE FLEEING SOUTH TO IRWINVILLE. SO FAR, A TRAIL OF CLUES HAVE LED THEM TO A SWAMP. BUT THE DREDGE THEY'RE RELYING ON TO SEARCH FOR THE GOLD HAS FAILED. WE REALLY HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM HERE. WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON, DAN? I WANNA FIND ME GOLD. AND I CAN'T BECAUSE THIS THING'S NOT WORKIN'. Narrator: DAN YARRUSSO HAS HUNTED IN WATER FOR OVER 30 YEARS. HE'S COME UP WITH A PLAN TO PRIME THE PUMP MANUALLY. LARRY WILL HAVE TO SUCK WATER UP INTO THE PRESSURE HOSE TO CREATE THE VACUUM NEEDED TO GET THE DREDGE RESTARTED. WE GOT WATER. WE GOT WATER. TURN IT ON. THERE IT GOES. NO PROBLEM. OH! THERE WE GO! WHOO! Narrator: WITH THE DREDGE RUNNING AGAIN, THE TEAM MUST GET TO WORK QUICKLY BEFORE THEY LOSE DAYLIGHT. WHAT THE HECK? OH, MAN! IT'S A BULLET! WOO-HOO! IT'S A CIVIL WAR BULLET, CONFEDERATE. MAN. Narrator: THE TEAM HAS PULLED UP AN ENFIELD BULLET, THE FIRST SIGN OF A CIVIL WAR MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE AREA. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS WERE HERE. WITH NIGHT RAPIDLY APPROACHING, WATER TEMPERATURES DROPPING, AND NO SIGNS OF THE GOLD... SHUT IT DOWN? Narrator: THE TEAM CALLS IT A DAY. ALL SIGNS INDICATE, EVERYTHING WE DUG, WHAT... POWDER FLASK HERE, THE STUFF UP ON THE FLAT, BULLETS IN THE WATER, THAT'S A... THAT'S A TRAIN LEAVIN' OUT OF HERE. LET'S PACK UP OUR GEAR. AND LET'S GET BACK ON ITS HEELS. WE'RE GONNA FIND IT. WE'RE... WE'RE ON IT. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO NEED TO STOP NOW. I MEAN, NOBODY'S GOTTEN THIS FAR. WE HAVE. AND WE KNOW WHERE IT IS. IT'S WITH JEFF DAVIS. AND WHEREVER HE GOES, WE GO. Narrator: A HUNDRED MILES AWAY, BRANT AND HIS TEAM HAVE HIT ANOTHER DEAD END. THEY'VE LOST THE 200-YEAR-OLD ROAD TO THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE, SITE OF THE 1865 TREASURE ROBBERY. THE TEAM SPLIT UP TO FIND ANY SIGN OF THE LONG LOST PROPERTY. BRANT BELIEVES A SMALL BAND OF CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS ONCE STOLE $13 MILLION IN GOLD BACK FROM UNION TROOPS ON THIS SITE AT THE END OF THE WAR. IF HE CAN'T FIND IT, HE'LL HAVE TO RETHINK HIS ENTIRE THEORY. [ BEEPING ] STARTIN' TO HEAR A LITTLE IRON. I'M STARTIN' TO HEAR A LOT NOW. THERE'S SOMETHIN' IN HERE. PIECE OF IRON COOKPOT, EARLY SIGN OF LIFE. Narrator: THEN, ACROSS THIS WOODED FIELD, BRANT DISCOVERS PROMISING SIGNS OF CIVIL WAR-ERA DEVELOPMENT. I'M SEEIN' ROCK TOPS RIGHT HERE. RIGHT NOW. Narrator: THE ROCK TOPS ARE SIGNS OF AN OLD FOUNDATION, DEFINITIVE PROOF THAT A HOME WAS ONCE HERE. YOU CAN TELL BY HOW BIG THIS LAYOUT IS THIS WAS A BIG HOME. Narrator: NOW THE QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS OLD HOME WAS HERE DURING THE RIGHT TIME FRAME... 1865 OR EARLIER. I FOUND AN OLD BRICK. PERIOD. LOOK HOW SOFT, HOW SOFT THAT BRICK IS. IT'S GOOD. Narrator: THE BRICK CRUMBLES WITH LITTLE PRESSURE AND HAS A CHALKY SUBSTANCE THAT IS THE SIGNATURE OF A BRICK MADE BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR. BRENT, I THINK... I THINK THIS COULD BE THE PLACE, MAN. I THINK IT IS, TOO. Narrator: 150 YEARS AGO, HOMES WERE SPACED MILES APART. FINDING THE REMAINS OF AN 1860s HOMESTEAD WITHIN THEIR TARGET PERIMETER MEANS IT'S HIGHLY LIKELY THIS IS THE SITE THEY'VE BEEN HUNTING DOWN... THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE. NOW THE TEAM CAN CONCENTRATE THEIR EFFORTS ON FINDING GOLD OR SIGNS OF THE INFAMOUS HEIST. YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH JUST ANY GOLD COIN. YOU'RE DEALING WITH A GOLD COIN THAT WAS TOOK IN A HEIST THAT WAS COMPLETELY TIED TO JEFF DAVIS. SO IF ONE COIN WOULD BRING $3,000 AND YOU DIG 30 COINS FROM THAT ONE SPOT, THAT'S A MOTHER LODE. Narrator: COMING UP, AS THE COMPETITION TO FIND THE GOLD HEATS UP... I KNOW LARRY'S OVER THERE HITTIN' A DEAD END. AND WE'RE IN THE SPOT. Narrator: BRANT AND HIS TEAM MAKE A HUGE DISCOVERY. THAT'S PART OF A DAMN WRISTBREAKER, SON. Narrator: A CLUE THAT JUST MAY SOLVE ONE OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN MYSTERIES. SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRAIL. YEAH. WHOO! Narrator: MEANWHILE... CLOCK'S TICKIN' TODAY. Narrator: FRUSTRATION MOUNTS AS LARRY AND HIS TEAM WORK OVERTIME TO FIND THE GOLD. HE AIN'T EVEN LOOKIN' IN THE RIGHT PLACE. WANT ME TO PUSH IT A WHILE? LET ME PUSH IT A WHILE. Narrator: CAUSING SOME TO HIT THEIR BREAKING POINT. I'M NOT HERE TO HAVE SOMEBODY BE JUMPIN' ON ME. AND I DON'T PUT UP WITH THAT KINDA CRAP. ** ** YOU KNOW, LARRY AIN'T BEEN TELLIN' US MUCH. I DON'T THINK HE'S BEEN SHARING MUCH INFORMATION WITH US. YOU GOT THAT [BLEEP] RIGHT. WE AIN'T HEARD NOTHIN' FROM THAT LITTLE WEASEL IN SEVERAL DAYS. WE'VE BEEN SHARIN' OUR INFORMATION. AND THEY AIN'T... AIN'T BEEN TELLIN' US MUCH OF NOTHIN'. ALL WE BEEN HEARIN' IS, "WE AIN'T FINDIN' NOTHIN'." YEAH. AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW IF I BELIEVE THAT OR NOT. I DON'T EITHER. I THINK HE'S HIDIN' SOMETHIN'. EVEN OUR BUDDY DANO HAS BEEN KINDA QUIET. YEAH. I THINK HE'S BEEN TRYIN' TO GIVE US HINTS BUT DOESN'T WANNA... JEOPARDIZE HIS POSITION. NO. I DID HEAR HIM SAY THAT HE WAS WILLING TO JUMP SHIP. YEAH. WE'VE HEARD HIM TALKIN' 'BOUT HE AIN'T TO HAPPY WHERE HE'S HUNTIN' AT. NO. I'D BE MORE THAN GLAD TO HAVE HIM OVER HERE WITH US. YOU RIGHT. THAT'D GIVE US A BIG ADVANTAGE, HAVE FIVE PEOPLE. ** Narrator: IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, TREASURE HUNTERS BRANT, MIKE, TRACY, AND EARL ARE ON THE BRINK OF SOLVING A 150-YEAR-OLD CRIME. THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO PINPOINT THE SITE OF THE 1865 ROBBERY. NOW, BRANT IS MOMENTS AWAY FROM PROVING HIS THEORY OF WHO STOLE THE LOST REBEL GOLD. IT DON'T GET NO BETTER THAN RIGHT HERE WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW. I KNOW LARRY'S OVER THERE HITTIN' A DEAD END. AND WE'RE IN THE SPOT. Narrator: ON MAY 24, 1865, TWO WEEKS AFTER JEFFERSON DAVIS WAS CAPTURED, $450,000 OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURY WAS CONFISCATED BY UNION TROOPS IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, AND SENT ON A SECRET ROUTE NORTH. WHEN UNION ARMY ESCORTS STOPPED TO CAMP AT THE DAVID MOSS HOME, $250,000 WAS STOLEN AND NEVER RECOVERED. TODAY IT IS WORTH OVER $13 MILLION. SOME SUSPECT LOCALS. BUT BRANT BELIEVES THAT THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY, A CONFEDERATE UNIT, DEVISED THE PLAN TO GET THEIR GOLD BACK FROM THE UNION. I GOT AN OLD HORSESHOE HERE. THAT'S PART OF AN... OFF OF AN OLD WAGON. I GOT A PIECE OFF A HORSE BIT. PIECE OFF A HORSE BIT? Narrator: THE TEAM HAS FOUND A HOT SPOT. HORSE AND WAGON PARTS THAT COULD BE FROM THE VIOLENT ROBBERY. IF THEY CAN FIND CLUES THAT REVEAL THE IDENTITY OF THE BANDITS, IT JUST MIGHT LEAD THEM RIGHT TO THE GOLD. A PIECE OF SCRAP IRON? BOYS, I DON'T KNOW. THIS COULD BE PART OF A BROKE SWORD BLADE. LOOK AT THE CURVE ON IT. IT'S GOT A EDGE. THAT'S PART OF A DAMN WRISTBREAKER, SON. Narrator: THE WRISTBREAKER, ALSO KNOWN AS THE MODEL 1840 CAVALRY SABER, WAS ISSUED TO UNION TROOPS THROUGHOUT THE CIVIL WAR. IT WAS ADOPTED BY THE CONFEDERATE CAVALRY AND OFTEN MODIFIED TO MAKE THEM MORE EFFICIENT KILLING MACHINES. HEY, BRANT! YO! I FOUND A SWORD BLADE. YOU TELL ME THAT AIN'T A WRISTBREAKER, SON. THAT'S DEFINITELY WHAT IT IS. YEAH, IT'S DEFINITELY WHAT IT IS. THERE. THERE'S A BLOOD VEIN ON THAT SIDE. AND RIGHT IN HERE IS THE BLOOD VEIN ON THIS SIDE. Narrator: THE BLOOD VEIN, A THIN GROOVE THAT RUNS DOWN THE THICK EDGE OF A SWORD MAKING IT LIGHTER AND STIFFER, A SIGNATURE DESIGN FOUND ONLY ON MODEL 1840 SABERS USED BY THE CONFEDERATE CAVALRY. HEY, THIS CONFIRMS WHAT WE'VE BEEN THINKIN'. THE SIMPLE FACT IS TRACY FOUND A SWORD BLADE THAT CONNECTS TO THE CAVALRY. Narrator: IF BRANT CAN PROVE THAT THIS SWORD DID INDEED BELONG TO THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY, HE'LL SOLVE THIS 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY AND MAYBE UNEARTH $13 MILLION IN LOST REBEL GOLD. THEY COULD'VE HIDDEN IT. THEY COULD'VE ROLLED ON WITH IT. IT COULD'VE SPILLED OUT. I'M CONVINCED OF IT. Narrator: THE TEAM IS SEARCHING A 333-SQUARE-FOOT AREA AROUND THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE, THE SITE WHERE THE ROBBERY TOOK PLACE IN 1865. BRANT UNEARTHS AN EAGLE BUTTON, WORN ON THE UNIFORMS OF THE UNION ARMY'S INFANTRY. BUT IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THAT THE UNION CAVALRY WAS ESCORTING THE CONFISCATED CONFEDERATE TREASURE BACK UP NORTH, NOT THE INFANTRY. NOW WE'RE FINDING ALL KINDS OF CAVALRY STUFF AROUND HERE. THERE'S NO TRACES OF INFANTRY EVER BEIN' THROUGH HERE. HEY, GUYS I GOT A BUTTON. IT'S EAGLE BUTTON. THAT'S DEFINITELY A YANKEE-ISSUED BUTTON. IT'S PRETTY WEIRD WE'RE FINDING EAGLE BUTTONS IN HERE INSTEAD OF CONFEDERATE BUTTONS. WELL, YOU KNOW, THIS BRINGS ME TO A THOUGHT. Narrator: AFTER FINDING YET ANOTHER UNION INFANTRY BUTTON, BRANT CALLS THE TEAM TOGETHER TO DISCUSS THE PUZZLING DISCOVERIES. YOU FOUND THAT CAVALRY SWORD AND THAT TELLS ME... YEAH. IT WAS CAVALRY THROUGH HERE. YEAH. YANKEE INFANTRY DIDN'T CARRY SWORDS. THEY DID NOT CARRY CAVALRY SWORDS. WHAT BETTER WAY TO MAKE A RAID THAN BE IN ENEMY UNIFORM. Narrator: DURING BRANT'S EXTENSIVE RESEARCH TO FIND THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE, HE CAME ACROSS STORIES OF CAPTAIN IRWIN, A TENNESSEE CAVALRYMAN KNOWN FOR HIS DECEPTIVE BATTLE TACTICS LIKE WEARING UNION JACKETS TO SNEAK BEHIND ENEMY LINES AND SPY ON THE NORTH. THE CLUES POINT TO IRWIN'S CAVALRY UNIT BEING AT THE ROBBERY SITE. BUT ACCORDING TO RECORDS, THEY WERE DISMISSED WEEKS AGO AND HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. BASED ON EVERYTHING HE'S FOUND, BRANT BELIEVES HE KNOWS WHY IRWIN AND HIS CAVALRY UNIT WERE IN WASHINGTON. THEY FOLLOWED THE GOLD HERE BECAUSE THEM BOYS HAD DONE MADE A PLAN TO STEAL IT. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW, AFTER ALL THE DEAD ENDS WE'VE WENT THROUGH AND ALL THE HEADS HUNG LOW WITH THE TAILS TUCKED BETWEEN OUR LEGS, WE HAVE SOLVED THE 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY. Narrator: AFTER FINDING CONFEDERATE RELICS NEAR THE OCONEE RIVER BUT NO GOLD, LARRY AND HIS TEAM ARE CONVINCED JEFFERSON DAVIS MUST HAVE STASHED THE TREASURE SOMEWHERE ELSE ALONG HIS SOUTHERN ROUTE. WITH THE UNION ARMY CLOSING IN, LARRY BELIEVES THAT DAVIS WOULD'VE HAD ONLY ONE CHOICE... LEAVE THE TREASURE WITH PEOPLE HE COULD TRUST. THIS CIVIL WAR-ERA HOME WAS ONE OF THE LAST PLANTATIONS ON DAVIS' TRAIL BEFORE HE WAS CAPTURED. THE TEAM HAS TO CONFIRM THAT DAVIS WAS HERE, AND IF SO, WHETHER THIS IS THE FINAL RESTING PLACE FOR THE MILLIONS IN REBEL GOLD LARRY BELIEVES HE HAD WITH HIM. ALL RIGHT, HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. YOU GET THAT G.P.R. UNIT, AND WE'LL GO START LOOKIN' FOR THE DEPRESSIONS, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. WHAT WE'RE LOOKIN' FOR IS A HIDIN' SPOT WHERE THEY WOULD'VE HID SOME OF THIS GOLD. MAYBE PRIVY, MAYBE THE TRASH PIT, SOMETHING THAT WHERE NOBODY ELSE WOULD LOOK. LOOK, THAT LITTLE DIP RIGHT THERE'S HOLDIN' WATER. SO THAT TELLS YOU THAT IT'S A LOW SPOT RIGHT THERE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. WHERE'S DANO AT? HE NEEDS TO COME ON WITH IT. I'M GONNA GET THE G.P.R. SET UP AND I'M GONNA HIT IT RUNNIN', MAN. Narrator: GROUND PENETRATING RADAR, OR G.P.R., BLASTS RADIO WAVES HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW THE SURFACE AND MEASURES HOW THE SIGNAL BOUNCES BACK. UNDISTURBED EARTH RETURNS A UNIFORM SIGNAL. ANY ANOMALIES IN THE SOIL AND THE RADIO WAVES BOUNCE IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS. THE G.P.R. DISPLAY SHOWS AN EXPERIENCED TREASURE HUNTER ANY AREAS OF DISTURBED GROUND THAT COULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD BURIED TREASURE. Dan: BETTER GO OVER IT AGAIN. SEE WHERE HE'S WALKIN'? YEAH. GO RIGHT OVER TO THAT SPOT RIGHT THERE. WE GOT TO GET ON SOMETHIN' FAST, BROTHER. I WANNA WORK OUT TOWARDS THE BACK OF THIS HOUSE. UH, PROBABLY AROUND THESE... THIS TREE AREA HERE. THINK HE'S TOO FAR OFF. I MEAN, HE NEEDS TO BE UP IN HERE. WE GOT DAN IN CHARGE OF THE G.P.R. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOIN'. KINDA LIKE A BLIND SQUIRREL TRYIN' TO FIND A NUT. I MEAN, CLOCK'S TICKIN' TODAY. BURNIN' DAYLIGHT. WENT TOO FAR BACK, I THINK, FOR THAT PRIVY TO BE WAY BACK HERE. HE AIN'T EVEN LOOKIN' IN THE RIGHT PLACE. WE DON'T... WE DON'T HAVE, LIKE, A MONTH TO DO THIS. WE'RE JUST WASTING OUR DAMN TIME. GO OFF TO THE LEFT A LITTLE BIT. DAN. OVER THIS WAY, BUDDY. ALL RIGHT. YOU SEE... HEY, COME RIGHT AT ME. I WANT IT RIGHT HERE. YOU WANT ME TO PUSH IT A WHILE? IT'S GOTTA BE OFF AROUND HERE. WANT ME TO PUSH IT A WHILE? YEAH, GO AHEAD. LET ME PUSH IT A WHILE. LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO HERE. Dan: I'M NOT HERE TO HAVE SOMEBODY BE JUMPIN' ON ME. I'M DOIN' THE BEST I CAN. I JUST... I DON'T PUT UP WITH THAT KINDA CRAP. YOU GOT A HICCUP RIGHT THERE. MORE HICCUPS. IT'S RIGHT HERE. GO GET A METAL DETECTOR, LET'S SEE IF WE GET ANY IRON AROUND HERE. THESE TRASH PITS AND EVEN WHERE THE OUTHOUSE WAS, THERE'D BE NAILS AND IRON AND JUNK. AND THAT... THAT RIGHT THERE WILL GIVE US A SECOND INDICATION THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO GET THE BACKHOE AND OPEN IT UP, AND SEE WHAT'S IN IT. OH, MY GOODNESS. WHOO. HEY, I JUST DUG A WHITWORTH. THIS IS A CONFEDERATE SHARPSHOOTER BULLET. WHITWORTH. A VERY RARE BULLET. Narrator: IN 1854, BRITISH ENGINEER JOSEPH WHITWORTH DESIGNED AND PATENTED A RIFLE WITH A HEXAGONAL BARREL INSTEAD OF THE TRADITIONAL ROUND BARREL. THE TWISTED DESIGN AND LONGER, THINNER BULLETS MEANT SOLDIERS COULD FIRE WITH MORE STABILITY, GREATER ACCURACY, AND LONGER DISTANCE. FOR CONFEDERATE SHARPSHOOTERS, THE WHITWORTH RIFLE BECAME THE GUN OF CHOICE. THERE HAVE BEEN KNOWN CASES WHERE A CONFEDERATE SHARPSHOOTER KILLED A GENERAL WITH ONE OF THESE RIFLES FROM ALMOST A MILE AWAY. EVERY ONE OF 'EM HAD BLACK EYES FROM THE RECOIL. THEY WOULDN'T HAVE SHARPSHOOTERS IN THIS AREA THIS LATE IN THE WAR UNLESS THERE WAS SOMETHIN' AROUND HERE THEY WERE GUARDIN'. Narrator: THIS ONE FIND JUST MIGHT PROVE LARRY RIGHT. JEFFERSON DAVIS COULD'VE DUMPED REBEL GOLD AT THIS PLANTATION HOME RIGHT BEFORE HIS ARREST. HEY, STAY WITH ME. STAY WITH ME. I'LL LEAD YOU TO THE PROMISED LAND. ** Narrator: OUTSIDE IRWINVILLE, GEORGIA, BRANT AND TRACY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE PLANTATION LARRY IS EXCAVATING. ALL THE CLUES ON HIS HUNT HAVE LED HIM TO THE CONCLUSION THAT CAPTAIN IRWIN AND THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY STOLE THE GOLD. NOW HE WANTS TO COMPARE NOTES AND SEE HOW FAR LARRY HAS GOTTEN WITH HIS THEORY. I'VE SORT OF CAUGHT WIND THAT LARRY'S GOT A BIG DIG GOIN' ON. I'M 100 PERCENT POSITIVE HE'S NOT HOLDING A GOOD A DECK OF CARDS AS WE ARE. Narrator: AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE JOURNEY FULL OF UPS AND DOWNS, THE PRESSURE'S ON LARRY AND HIS TEAM TO FIND THE LOST REBEL GOLD THAT HE BELIEVES IS BURIED AT THIS ANTEBELLUM HOME, THE LAST SAFE PLACE JEFFERSON DAVIS COULD'VE LEFT IT BEFORE HIS CAPTURE. THEY WERE TRYIN' TO GET THIS GOLD TO TEXAS. AND THEY WERE CAUGHT RIGHT DOWN THE ROAD. THAT GOLD WAS BURIED, AND WE'RE GONNA FIND IT. Narrator: BEHIND THE PLANTATION HOUSE, LARRY'S TEAM CAME UPON A RARE WHITWORTH BULLET USED BY SNIPERS GUARDING THE TREASURE. LARRY'S CHANCE TO PROVE HIS THEORY THAT DAVIS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERACY, BURIED THE GOLD JUST BEFORE HIS ARREST, COMES DOWN TO THIS LAST DIG. GONNA SCRAPE, UH, THE TOP OFF OF IT. HOPEFULLY IT'S GONNA BE EITHER THE WELL, THE PRIVY, OR THE TRASH PIT. LET'S KEEP OUR FINGERS CROSSED, MAN. WE REALLY NEED TO SCORE RIGHT HERE. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DIGGIN' OVER HERE? WE DECIDED WE WAS GONNA COME VISIT ON YOUR SIDE SINCE WE AIN'T HEARD NOTHIN' FROM Y'ALL. Larry: THEY DON'T TRUST US. THEY, UH, PRYIN' US FOR INFORMATION, A LITTLE SHOW-AND-TELL MAYBE. BUT WE WON'T SHOW 'EM EVERYTHING. AND WE WON'T TELL 'EM EVERYTHING. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT, MAN? THERE'S DEFINITELY SOMETHIN' DOWN THERE. Y'ALL JUST IN TIME. GET A SHOVEL. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? WHAT THE HECK IS THAT, MAN? WHAT? Narrator: WHAT LARRY HAS UNCOVERED ISN'T BURIED TREASURE. IT'S AN OIL TANK USED TO HEAT OLD HOMES. LET ME SEE THAT. I KNOW WHAT IT IS. IT'S A BIG, OLD STORAGE TANK. WHAT AN EMBARRASSIN'-ASS MOMENT. THE OTHER TEAM WALKS UP ON YOU AND YOU'VE DUG A OIL TANK IN THE GROUND? BRAVO, LARRY, BRAVO. Narrator: LARRY'S FINAL HOPE FOR FINDING TREASURE ALONG JEFFERSON DAVIS' ESCAPE ROUTE IS A BUST. CANNOT BELIEVE 700 MILES OF TRAVELIN' AFTER JEFFERSON DAVIS, THE GOLD, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE DOWN HERE WHERE HE GETS CAPTURED, AND NOTHIN'. WE GOT NOTHIN'. Narrator: AS THE TWO TEAM LEADERS, LARRY AND BRANT MUST NOW AGREE ON THEIR NEXT MOVE. MY BELIEF IS THAT JEFF DAVIS TOOK THE GOLD WITH HIM, AND HE WAS TRYIN' TO GET TO TEXAS TO CONTINUE THE WAR. WHEN HE WAS CAPTURED... MM-HMM. HE HAD TWO TEXANS WITH HIM... JOHN REAGAN AND FRANCIS LUBBOCK. THOSE ARE IMPORTANT PEOPLE. THEY WERE TRYIN' TO GET HIM AND THE GOLD TO TEXAS. I'M GOIN' TO TEXAS. WELL, YEAH. BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS THEY CAUGHT HIM AND ALL THE TROOPS WITH HIM. HE DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE COIN. Narrator: LARRY NOW BELIEVES THAT DAVIS DIDN'T BURY THE TREASURE. HE GAVE IT TO HIS MEN TO TAKE TO TEXAS IN THE HOPES THAT THEY COULD REKINDLE THE WAR. HERE'S THE FACTS. THE UNION ARMY CONFISCATED THE TREASURE. THEY WAS HEADED BACK TO RICHMOND WITH IT. THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY COME IN THERE, RAIDED 'EM, STOLE IT, AND HEADED TO TENNESSEE WITH IT. NO, NO, NO. THE STORY IS A FAIRY TALE. IT'S FICTION. TO ME, THAT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT NEVER HAPPENED. FACT IS, JEFF DAVIS, HE HAD TO HAVE IT. HE HAD TO HAVE IT TO SURVIVE. YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT EVIDENCE THAT THAT TREASURE WAS STOLEN. I'VE DONE FOUND THE LOCATION WHERE IT WAS STOLEN FROM. MAN, I'M GOIN' TO TENNESSEE. IN MY OPINION, I... I DON'T BELIEVE THEY HAVE A CHANCE AT ALL OF FINDING GOLD. GOLD WASN'T HEADED TO TENNESSEE. IT WAS HEADED TO TEXAS. I THINK HE'S BARKIN' UP THE WRONG TREE. LARRY'S THEORY AND MY THEORY ARE TWO WORLDS APART. AND LARRY'S THEORY IS HEADIN' HIM STRAIGHT INTO A BLOCK WALL. HE CAN'T GO NO FURTHER. AND MY... MY THEORY... THERE'S NOTHIN' BUT AIR AND OPPORTUNITY BETWEEN US. WE CAN SIT HERE AND ARGUE TILL WE'RE BLUE IN THE FACE. WE CAN ARGUE TILL THE SUN FALLS OVER AND THE MOON COMES OUT... WELL, THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT. ...AND THE SUN COMES BACK UP. THAT'S RIGHT. LET'S JUST AGREE TO DISAGREE. THE WAY I'M SEEIN' THIS, LOOKS LIKE THE TWO GROUPS IS GONNA BREAK FAST. WHICHEVER GROUP FINDS IT... EITHER I'M GONNA BE HAVIN' MY NAME ON THE FRONT OF THE BOOK, AND YOURS WILL JUST BE IN THE CREDITS, OR IT'LL BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. YOU TAKE YOUR ROUTE. I'LL TAKE MY ROUTE. MAYBE BOTH OF US... YOU MAY FIND YOUR PART, AND I MIGHT FIND MINE. GOOD LUCK TO YOU, BRO. GOOD LUCK. MAY THE BEST MAN WIN ON THIS CHARGE. YOU GOT IT, BROTHER. Narrator: TWO MEN WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT THEORIES. DO I THINK HE'S GONNA FIND THE REAL TREASURE? NO, HE AIN'T GONNA FIND IT. HE'S GONNA HIT A DEAD-END WALL. IN THE VERY END, HE'S GONNA BE VERY DISAPPOINTED. Narrator: DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES, BOTH MEN ARE DEAD SET ON SOLVING THE BIGGEST MYSTERY IN AMERICAN HISTORY. Larry: WE FIND ANY RELICS, WE'LL FIND THE CLUES, WE'RE GONNA FIND THE GOLD. Brant: HIM AND HIS GROUP CAN DO THINGS HIS WAY. ME AND MY GROUP'S GONNA DO THINGS OUR WAY. MY NAME'S GONNA BE ON THE TITLE PAGE. HE CAN BE IN THE BACK OF THE BOOK. Narrator: AFTER 150 YEARS, COUNTLESS THEORIES, AND DEVASTATING DEAD ENDS, THE SEARCH FOR THE ELUSIVE LOST REBEL GOLD CONTINUES.
