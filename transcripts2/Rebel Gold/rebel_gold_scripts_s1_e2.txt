 Narrator: SOMEWHERE ALONG THIS 500-MILE TRAIL OF TRAIN TRACK, THE FORTUNE DISAPPEARED INTO THIN AIR AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME TO A QUICK AND BLOODY END. DANVILLE, VIRGINIA. ONCE THE SOUTH'S GREAT TOBACCO CAPITAL, THIS INDUSTRIAL TOWN WAS THE FIRST STOP ON JEFFERSON DAVIS' MAD DASH SOUTH. THE LAST OF THE CONFEDERATES' MONEY MADE A PIT STOP HERE IN 1865. Man: THERE'S A LOT OF THEORIES AS TO WHAT HAPPENED TO IT AND WHERE IT WENT. Narrator: TODAY, SEVEN OF THE BEST TREASURE HUNTERS IN THE COUNTRY SPREAD OUT ACROSS DANVILLE TO CONTINUE THEIR QUEST TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY

 OF THE CONFEDERATE ARMY'S MISSING GOLD AND SILVER. WE'RE AFTER THE BIG PRIZE... THOUSANDS OF POUNDS OF SILVER. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. Narrator: TWO TEAMS... I WANT TO CHECK THAT DEPOT. IT'S GOT TO BE THERE. ...TWO STRONG LEADERS... SO THE SITE'S REALLY HOT RIGHT NOW. ALL OF THE CLUES HAVE FINALLY COME FULL CIRCLE. WE'RE GONNA GO TEAR THE DIRT UP AND FIND SOMETHING. Narrator: ...HUNT OFF THE BEATEN PATH... PETE, I'VE BEEN DIGGING 30 YEARS AND NEVER SEEN NOTHING LIKE THAT. ...CHASING DOWN CLUES THAT JUST MIGHT LEAD THEM... HOOYAH! HOOYAH! ...TO THE LOST REBEL GOLD. WHOO! DUDE, THAT IS AWESOME. CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Narrator: ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, ON WHAT WAS ONCE ONE OF THE GREATEST TOBACCO PLANTATIONS IN THE SOUTH, TWO TREASURE HUNTERS ARE CONVINCED THEY'VE CRACKED THE CODE TO A 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY. THEY'RE ABOUT TO MAKE THE DISCOVERY OF A LIFETIME... 39 KEGS OF CONFEDERATE SILVER WORTH AN ESTIMATED $2 MILLION THAT WENT MISSING AFTER JEFFERSON DAVIS FLED DANVILLE WITH UNION TROOPS HOT ON HIS TRAIL. SO, WE COME TO DANVILLE. WE HIT THIS HAIRSTON PLANTATION. ME AND MY TEAM, WE HIT THE SLAVE QUARTERS. AND BRANT'S TEAM HIT THIS DUMP SITE. BOTH ARE GREAT LOCATIONS IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO FIND THIS SILVER THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND HERE IN DANVILLE. PLUS THERE'S RECORD THAT THEY HAD FOUND SOME OF IT HERE. SO THESE ARE GREAT LOCATIONS FOR US TO LOOK. Narrator: LARRY CISSNA LEFT A THRIVING RELIC-HUNTING BUSINESS IN TEXAS TO HUNT THE REBEL TREASURE. THIS IS HIS LAST SHOT TO SOLVE THE AGE-OLD MYSTERY. THERE'S A LOT OF SACRIFICES BEING MADE WITH OUR JOBS, WITH OUR FAMILIES, OUR CHILDREN. WE'RE PUTTING IT ALL ON THE LINE RIGHT HERE. THERE AIN'T NO GOING BACK. WE HAVE GOT TO BE SUCCESSFUL. Narrator: AFTER A DISAPPOINTING SEARCH OF THE WALLS IN A LOCAL MANSION WHERE JEFFERSON DAVIS ONCE STAYED... IT'S A PIPE. DADGUM IT. ...LARRY JOINED BRANT ARNOLD AT THE DAN RIVER PLANTATION, ONCE HOME TO ONE OF THE RICHEST AND MOST POWERFUL FAMILIES OF THE CONFEDERACY. ON THIS NEARLY 300-ACRE PROPERTY, LARRY FOCUSED HIS SEARCH ON THE DILAPIDATED 200-YEAR-OLD SLAVE QUARTERS... THE SLAVES WERE THE GUARDIANS OF THE TREASURE. Narrator: ...AND IMMEDIATELY START FINDING CLUES. OH, IT'S A SILVER COIN. OH! THAT'S SILVER. AND THEY COULD HAVE PUT THIS WITH IT. THEY WOULD'VE HAD THAT IN SILVER. DUDE, I THINK WE JUST FOUND IT. Cissna: WHEN YOU HAVE SEVERAL GUYS WORKING TOGETHER, YOU GOT TO HAVE THAT ONE GUY THAT KEEPS YOU PUMPED UP. I'M THAT GUY. WE GOT SOME TREASURE, BUDDY! Narrator: BRANT ARNOLD, AN ACCOMPLISHED TREASURE HUNTER, DROVE DOWN FROM HIS HOME IN TENNESSEE TO BE A PART OF THIS HISTORIC EXPEDITION. I WANT TO BE THAT GUY TO FIND IT. AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO GO DOWN IN THE HISTORY BOOKS. Narrator: HE'S BEEN SEARCHING FOR THE REBEL GOLD FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE AND HAS NEVER BEEN CLOSER THAN RIGHT NOW. WHAT DID THEY JUST HIT, IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. OH! OH, OH, OH! OH, OH, OH, OH! NO, NO, NO, NO. BRANT'S TEAM IS NEARING THE BOTTOM OF A CIVIL WAR-ERA ICE PIT, WHERE THE ESTIMATED 9,000 POUNDS OF SILVER COULD'VE BEEN EASILY HIDDEN BY CONFEDERATE TROOPS AT THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR. AND IT IS PERIOD. YES! IT IS PERIOD. WHOO-HOO-HOO! THAT IS IT. THAT'S WHAT WE LOOKING FOR. THIS COULD BE IT. TODAY IS THE DAY. THIS [BLEEP] RIGHT HERE IS AS COOL AS IT GETS. IT GETS YOUR ADRENALINE RUSHING. Narrator: THE TEAM IS DIGGING UP CIVIL WAR-ERA RELICS. Scott: LET'S TAKE ANOTHER SCOOP. LET'S HOPE THIS HAPPENS RIGHT HERE. LET'S GO. Narrator: THE NEXT FEW FEET WILL DETERMINE IF THEY FOUND THE $2 MILLION IN MISSING REBEL SILVER. Arnold: WE'RE AT THE 1800s STUFF. WHEN THAT BACKHOE PULLS THE NEXT SCOOP OUT OF THE GROUND, THERE VERY WELL COULD BE SEVERAL COINS COME OUT OF IT. HOW MUCH FURTHER DOWN YOU THINK IT GOES? AT LEAST 3 FEET. MAN. TRACY. LOOK HOW BLACK. I THINK WE NEED TO EASE DOWN AND DIG IN THAT JUST FOR A MINUTE. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE DOWN THERE. THINK YOU GUYS ARE AT THE BOTTOM. MIKE'S TRYING TO RUN THE SHOW. BUT THE FACT IS, IF HE WANTS TO RUN THE SHOW, HE NEEDS TO GET IN THE HOLE AND DO THE WORK. PUT ME IN THE BUCKET. DO THAT? YEAH. HEY, TRACY, I'M GOING WITH YOU. YOU GUYS LOOK FUNNY IN THAT THING. [ LAUGHS ] THANK YOU, SIR. BRANT DOESN'T WANT TO GIVE UP. Mesimer: THEY'VE GOTTEN OUT OF THE DARK-COLORED DIRT AND GETTING BACK INTO THE RED CLAY. SO WHEN YOU GET INTO THAT CLAY, THAT MEANS THAT HASN'T BEEN DISTURBED. Narrator: DIRT THAT HASN'T BEEN DISTURBED CAN MEAN ONLY ONE THING. LET'S SEE IT. THEY'VE HIT A DEAD END. THAT'S THE BRICK WALL. THAT'S THE BOTTOM? YEAH. THIS IS DEAD END. YEAH. WE AIN'T NOTHING BUT SOLID BRICK OVER THERE. Scott: I JUST TOLD YOU THAT'S THE BOTTOM, AND YOU'RE HITTING A BUNCH OF BRICK. I MEAN, THAT WAS WHAT, 15 SECONDS AFTER I TOLD YOU THAT? Narrator: NOTHING HAS EVER BEEN BURIED BELOW THIS POINT. IT'S A DEVASTATING BLOW FOR THE TEAM. Short: THIS WAS A HELL OF A LEAD. BUT THIS IS PRETTY MUCH THE END OF IT. THERE'S NO SILVER IN THIS HOLE. Y'ALL DONE DONE ALL YOU CAN DO. IT'S TIME TO COME OUT OF THERE. Narrator: ACROSS THE PLANTATION, LARRY CISSNA'S TEAM CONTINUES THEIR EXCAVATION OF THE CRUMBLING SLAVE QUARTERS. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MONEY DUG UNDER THE SLAVE QUARTERS FOR THE SIMPLE FACT SLAVES AREN'T SUPPOSED TO HAVE MONEY. I JUST FEEL LIKE SOMETHING'S FIXING TO COME OUT OF HERE THAT'S GONNA BE AMAZING. Narrator: AS THEY DIG DEEPER INTO HISTORY, THE CLUES KEEP PILING UP. DUDE, WE GOT TO TAKE THIS OUT. LOOK AT 'ER. WELL, LOOK AT THAT. YEAH. HE JUST DUG A SMOKING PIPE. DUDE, IT'S GOT A FACE ON IT! WHOO! DUDE, THAT IS AWESOME! Cissna: THESE ARE DEFINITELY SLAVE QUARTERS. AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL SLAVE ITEMS THAT THEY WOULD'VE HAD. WE'RE FINDING STUFF LIKE... LIKE WHITE PEOPLE WOULD'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW, USING. Narrator: LARRY'S FINDS ARE PROMISING. BUT TO UNLOCK THE MYSTERY OF THE MISSING $2 MILLION IN SILVER, HE AND HIS TEAM WILL NEED HARD EVIDENCE THAT CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS SPENT TIME WITHIN THESE HALLOWED WALLS. Cissna: BUT THE ONE THING THAT'S MISSING IS SOME MILITARY ARTIFACTS. WE HAVE TO FIND THAT. AND NOT JUST ANY MILITARY ARTIFACT. IT'S GOT TO BE CONFEDERATE. CONFEDERATE MILITARY ARTIFACTS. AND MAN, MY BLOOD'S REALLY GONNA GET TO PUMPING. SO WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE. SO, HEY, LET'S PUT IT IN HIGH GEAR. GET A SHOVELFUL OF DIRT... THIS DIRT RIGHT HERE. I WANT TO CLEAN THIS OUT, DAN. LIKE, HERE... I'M GONNA... OH, I JUST SAW SOMETHING ROUND. HOLY MOLY. I JUST FLICKED IT UP HERE. WATCH OUT. I'M GONNA THROW THIS UP ON TOP. I DID. I SAW IT. HOLD IT. OH, YEAH. HOLY CRAP. HOLY MOLY. WHOO! LOOK AT THIS CONFEDERATE BUTTON. THAT AIN'T NO YANKEE BUTTON, IS IT? THAT'S A BIG BOY. OH, YEAH. THERE AIN'T NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT BEING CONFEDERATE. THIS IS A HUGE PIECE OF THE PUZZLE WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR. Narrator: FOR A CIVIL WAR RELIC HUNTER, A BUTTON IS A MAJOR FIND. THEY CAN PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT CLUES AS TO WHO WAS ON A PARTICULAR SITE. THEY SIGNIFY MILITARY RANK AND, IN THIS CASE, DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE UNION AND CONFEDERATE ARMY. Cissna: WHEN I FIRST SAW THAT BUTTON, I COULD TELL BY THE STRUCTURE AND THE SIZE OF IT, IT HAD TO BE CONFEDERATE. THEIR BUTTONS WERE BUILT LARGER. AND THE CADETS... NAVAL CADETS OF THE CONFEDERACY WERE WATCHING OVER THE TREASURE. THAT'S A GREAT CLUE THAT SOME OF THAT TREASURE BEING BURIED HERE UNDER THIS FLOOR. SO WE'RE GONNA DIG LIKE SOME CRAZY MEN IN HERE, FAST. Narrator: AFTER STRIKING OUT AT THE ICE HOUSE, BRANT'S TEAM MOVES OVER TO THE SLAVE QUARTERS, AN AREA THAT IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE PROMISING WITH EVERY PASSING SECOND. WHAT ARE YOU GUYS YELLING ABOUT? OH, LOOKY HERE. HEY, LISTEN HERE. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. COME ON IN AND SEE WHAT THE "A" TEAM GOT. OKAY. WHERE Y'ALL AT? [ LAUGHS ] HE DON'T LIKE THAT. LOOKIT. HE DON'T LIKE THAT "A" TEAM. LOOK AT THAT RIGHT HERE. IT'S A VIRGINIA BUTTON. YOU GOT GOOD EYES. THAT'S A BIG CLUE. SO, WHY DON'T WE ALL JUMP IN HERE? I AGREE TOTALLY. BUT LISTEN. THAT LAST ROOM DOWN THERE AIN'T GOT NO FLOOR JUICE. WHAT I CALL FLOOR JUICE IS DUST. AS SOON AS I PULLED THE RAFTERS UP, THAT'S A ZERO DOWN THERE. SO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO, AROUND THE SIDE OF THIS WALL RIGHT HERE... RIGHT. THAT'S GOT LOTS OF FLOOR JUICE RIGHT THERE. Y'ALL ARE GONNA HAVE A FIELD DAY, MAN. YEAH. PASS IT UP. GOOD DRY DIRT. GOOD DRY DIRT. GIVE ME AN EMPTY BUCKET. OKAY. BUCKET COMING IN. Cissna: IT'S LOOKING VERY PROMISING. THEY'RE THE GUYS WHO ARE GOING TO BE OUR NEIGHBORS NOW, YOU KNOW, ALL SEVEN OF US, AND A LOT OF DIRT'S GONNA START FLYING. BETWEEN ALL OF US NOW, WE COME TOGETHER AND MAYBE HIT THE BIG JACKPOT. HERE YOU GO, MIKE. Scott: WE DEFINITELY GOT THE RIGHT MAN ON THE SCREEN. EARL IS A MASTER. WHAT WAS IT? LOOKS TO BE SOME SORT OF BEAD. YOU KNOW, IF THIS IS A SLAVE QUARTERS, THIS COULD BE AN AFRICAN BEAD THEY BROUGHT WITH THEM. THIS WAS A TIE TO HOME FOR THEM. SO PROBABLY ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAD. IT'S EASY TO GET DISTRACTED WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TREASURE BECAUSE YOU COME ACROSS A BUNCH OF RELICS. LOOK AT THE LITTLE COLLECTION RIGHT THERE. WE'RE LOADING UP. WHEN YOU START FINDING RELICS, YOU GET THAT BUG, AND YOU WANT TO START DIGGING STUFF UP. WELL, WE'RE AFTER THE BIG PRIZE. WE'RE AFTER THE SILVER... THOUSANDS OF POUNDS OF SILVER. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR. HEY. YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WHAT ARE YOU FINDING? THIS IS A COMPLETE SQUARE WALL RIGHT HERE WHERE I'M AT. I'M DIGGING IN A SQUARE HOLE. MAY BE A CISTERN. INSIDE THE HOUSE, RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE FLOOR? I DON'T KNOW. WE'RE FIXING TO FIND OUT. RIGHT HERE. IT'S A BRICK WALL. THERE'S NO EXCUSE IN THE WORLD FOR A SQUARE HOLE TO BE RIGHT IN THE CENTER OF A SLAVE QUARTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE. I THINK WE MIGHT BE ON TO SOMETHING HERE. I DON'T KNOW. COULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO HIDE TREASURE. HEY, LARRY. YO. COME HERE, MAN. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS? BRICK LINED. BRICK LINED. BRICK LINED. COMPLETELY SQUARED OFF. WHY IN THE HELL IS THERE A SQUARE HOLE? LOOK. AND LOOK WHERE YOU'RE AT. LOOK BEHIND YOU. FIREPLACE. HEY, YOU GOT SOMETHING GOOD HERE. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS, RIGHT? THEY HAD A DOOR ON THIS. THIS WAS A HIDING SPOT. Narrator: BRANT THINKS HE'S FOUND A SECRET UNDERGROUND CELLAR. DURING THE CIVIL WAR, A TRAP DOOR COULD'VE BEEN CUT INTO THE FLOOR, GIVING PLANTATION RESIDENTS A LARGE AREA TO HIDE MONEY, VALUABLE FAMILY HEIRLOOMS, OR EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF CONFEDERATE TREASURE. I CAN JUST SEE IT. VISUALIZE THIS. ALL RIGHT? READY? IT'S GOT A DOOR. YOU KNOW, LAY THE RUG OVER IT AND SIT THE CHAIR ON IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE. YEP. YOU NEVER KNOW IT WAS HERE. I DETECT THAT IF YOU DON'T GET A HIT, BRANT... I THINK YOU'D AGREE WITH THIS. IF THAT'S DOWN THERE, THAT DETECTOR GONNA HEAR IT. TRACY'S METAL DETECTOR IS SO SENSITIVE IT CAN DETECT SILVER UP TO 10 FEET DEEP. A STRONG SIGNAL NOW COULD FOREVER CHANGE HISTORY. Arnold: I'M HOPING LIKE HELL WE GET BELOW THEM BRICKS AND THERE'S GONNA BE SILVER EVERYWHERE. GOT A LOT OF HOPES AND A LOT OF PRAYER ON THIS TODAY. Scott: YOU GETTING ANY HITS? WHAT'RE YOU HEARING? Narrator: JUST OUTSIDE DANVILLE, VIRGINIA, TREASURE HUNTER BRANT ARNOLD MAY HAVE JUST DISCOVERED THE LOCATION OF 39 KEGS OF LOST CONFEDERATE SILVER WORTH AN ESTIMATED $2 MILLION. YOU GETTING ANY HITS? IT AIN'T GOING OFF. THERE AIN'T NO SILVER DOWN THERE. IT'S GONE. I MEAN, YOU WOULD'VE DETECTED THAT. DUDE, THE SACRIFICE WE MADE FOR THIS, AND WE COME... WE'RE EMPTY. IT'S AGGRAVATING, YOU KNOW? I MEAN, WE'RE SO CLOSE, BUT WE'RE SO FAR. BUT WE FOUND THE HIDING SPOT. WE KNOW THIS RUMOR WAS TRUE. WELL, HERE IT IS. Narrator: WHILE DISAPPOINTING, THE TEAM IS CONFIDENT THAT BY JUST FINDING THE HIDING SPOT, THEY'RE CLOSER TO THE TREASURE THAN ANYONE IN HISTORY. Arnold: THIS IS THE LIFE OF A TREASURE HUNTER. MOVE ON TO THE NEXT CLUE. MOVE ON TO THE NEXT CLUE. EVENTUALLY, YOU GOT TO HIT A HOME RUN SOME TIME OR ANOTHER. WE TRIED. YEAH. CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TELL MY WIFE? SHE SAID, "DON'T COME HOME WITHOUT IT." CHECK DANVILLE OFF THE LIST. WE NEED TO MOVE ON. Narrator: AFTER LEAVING DANVILLE WITH $20 MILLION IN GOLD, SILVER AND BANK NOTES, THE TREASURE TRAIN RAN INTO A ROADBLOCK IN CHESTER, SOUTH CAROLINA. THE TRAIN LINES SOUTH OF THE CITY HAD BEEN DESTROYED BY GENERAL SHERMAN. WITH THE UNION TROOPS JUST DAYS BEHIND, THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONFEDERACY, JEFFERSON DAVIS, TRANSFERRED THE TREASURE TO HORSE-DRAWN WAGONS. BUT REPORTS SAY THAT DAVIS LIGHTENED THE LOAD TO SPEED UP HIS ESCAPE. LARRY IS SURE A PORTION OF THE LOST CONFEDERATE TREASURE REMAINS IN CHESTER TODAY. Short: HEY, FELLERS. ABOUT TIME Y'ALL GOT HERE. SLOW JEEP. YOU COULD'VE DONE BETTER WITH A PAIR OF MULES AND A WAGON BACKING IN THAT SPOT. GOOD TO SEE YOU, BUDDY. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD TO SEE YOU. GOOD. GOOD. GLAD Y'ALL MADE IT. Cissna: SO WE KNOW THE TRAIN CAME INTO HERE AND ENDED AT CHESTER. AND THERE WAS TONS OF TREASURE TAKEN OFF OF THAT TRAIN AND PUT ON THE WAGONS. THERE HAD TO BE A LOT OF WAGONS. ALL RIGHT. AND THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF THAT GOLD, I ALSO READ HE SAID, "AND LIGHTENED THE SHIP," WHICH... WE KNOW MEANT LIGHTEN THE LOAD. THAT'S RIGHT. Narrator: WHILE LARRY AND BRANT AGREE THAT TREASURE IS STILL HIDDEN IN AND AROUND CHESTER, NEITHER CAN AGREE ON WHERE. THEY SPLIT UP INTO TWO TEAMS. I WANT TO CHECK THAT DEPOT. I MEAN, THAT WAS THE FIRST PLACE IT COME OFF. IT'S GOT TO BE THERE. I THINK WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS CHECK WITH A PROMINENT FAMILY HERE, POSSIBLY A MASON, MORE THAN LIKELY, SOMEBODY JEFF DAVIS WOULD'VE TRUSTED THAT BELIEVED IN CONTINUING THE WAR. REMEMBER WHEN WE LEFT DANVILLE, WE WENT TO THAT PROMINENT FAMILY'S PLANTATION? Y'ALL CAN GO TO THE DEPOT. WE GOING TO A PROMINENT FAMILY'S PLANTATION. BUT NOW, ON THAT NOTE... ON THAT NOTE, Y'ALL WENT TO THAT PROMINENT FAMILY'S PLANTATION. THEN WE SHOWED UP THERE. THEN WE FOUND A HOLE THERE. Cissna: BRANT I MET THROUGH TRACY. DON'T REALLY KNOW HIM. HE'S KIND OF HEADSTRONG. AND THEN I GOT TO SIT THERE AND TAKE THAT CRAP, YOU KNOW? ALL RIGHT. GRASS IS GROWING, BOYS. LET'S GET. STAY IN TOUCH. ALL RIGHT, MAN. Y'ALL CALL US. CALL US IF YOU GET INTO SOMETHING. Eles: WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT BRANT? Cissna: DID YOU HEAR HIS FIRST WORDS OUT OF HIS MOUTH WHEN HE FOUND THAT FALSE FLOOR? "LOOK WHAT I FOUND." DUDE, I TOLD HIM WHERE TO DIG! "LOOK WHAT I FOUND." YOU KNOW, IN TREASURE HUNTING, WE'RE KIND OF COMPETITIVE. YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE THE GUY TO SAY "I," "I," "I," AND "ME," "ME," "ME," EVEN THOUGH IT'S A TEAM EFFORT. YOU UNCOVER THE GOLD, THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF "I" AND "ME" IN THAT, ISN'T THERE? Narrator: LARRY BELIEVES THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS WOULD'VE FUNNELED A CHUNK OF THE TREASURE TO A TRUSTED MEMBER OF HIS INNER CIRCLE, MANY OF WHOM WERE FREEMASONS. Narrator: SO, I MEAN, JEFF DAVIS HAD SURROUNDED HIMSELF WITH MASONS. THEY WERE HIS CABINET MEMBERS OF THE CONFEDERATE GOVERNMENT. Narrator: JIM SMITH, MASTER OF THE CHESTER FREEMASON LODGE, HAS AGREED TO GIVE LARRY AND PETE UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS INTO THIS SHADOWY AND SECRET SOCIETY. Cissna: WE'RE EXTREMELY LUCKY. NOBODY ELSE HAS ACCESS TO IT. GOOD TO MEET YOU. THANK YOU, SIR. WELCOME IN. THANK YOU. PETER ELES. NICE TO MEET YOU. HOW CAN I HELP Y'ALL? YOU KNOW, WE'RE FOLLOWING THE TREASURE WITH JEFFERSON DAVIS OUT OF RICHMOND THROUGH THE CAROLINAS. SO OUR THEORY IS THEY WOULD'VE LEFT IT WITH MAYBE A PROMINENT FAMILY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A MASON. MOST OF THE VERY PROMINENT MEN IN THIS AREA, IN THIS TOWN AT THAT TIME, WOULD'VE BEEN MASONS. Narrator: FREEMASONS LIVE BY THREE BASIC PRINCIPLES... BROTHERLY LOVE, BELIEF, AND TRUTH. IT IS EACH MEMBER'S DUTY TO ACT OUT OF LOYALTY TO FELLOW MASONS. BECAUSE OF THIS SACRED COVENANT, MANY OF HISTORY'S GREATEST MEN WERE SAID TO BE PART OF THE SECRET BROTHERHOOD. ALL OF OUR RECORDS THAT HAVE SURVIVED ARE DOWNSTAIRS IN THE VAULT. IF YOU CARE TO GO DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK, SEE WHAT MIGHT BE DOWN THERE, YOU'RE WELCOME TO DO THAT. WE'LL GO DOWN THERE, HAVE A LOOK AT THEM. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO. ALL RIGHT. YOU BEEN DOWN HERE LATELY? NO, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE ANYBODY'S COME DOWN HERE. Narrator: LARRY AND PETE HAVE BEEN GRANTED ACCESS TO THE MOST SACRED AREA OF THIS GATHERING PLACE. THE VAULT SAFEGUARDS THE ORGANIZATION'S OLDEST, MOST VALUED POSSESSIONS AND SECRETS. CHECK THIS OUT, MAN. THESE ARE THE RECORDS, JIM, IN THESE BOXES? YEAH. WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY KIND OF RECORDS OF A PROMINENT FAMILY THAT LIVED HERE BACK DURING THE CIVIL WAR. ALL THIS STUFF IS KIND OF WET, ISN'T IT? WET IN HERE. IT'S DAMP, DANK. Narrator: ACROSS TOWN... ...BRANT AND TRACY HEAD FOR THE CHESTER TRAIN DEPOT, THE EXACT SPOT WHERE THE GOLD WAS TRANSFERRED FROM TRAIN CARS TO WAITING WAGONS IN APRIL OF 1865. BRANT, WHO'S BEEN STUDYING CONFEDERATE TROOP MOVEMENT FOR 18 YEARS, HAS HIS DOUBTS ABOUT LARRY'S FREEMASON THEORY. THEY WANT TO GO IN A MASONIC LODGE, THAT'S ALL FINE AND DANDY. LET THEM GO AND CHECK IT OUT. BUT YOU HAD AS MANY OFFICERS IN THE UNION ARMY THAT WAS MASONS AS THERE WAS IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY. SO, I MEAN, I DON'T FEEL IT BEING THERE AT ALL. BRANT'S THEORY IS SIMPLE. WITH THE UNION ARMY BEARING DOWN ON WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE, HE THINKS THAT THE REBELS WOULD'VE HIDDEN THE GOLD AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. THE QUICKEST HIDING SPOT WOULD'VE BEEN RIGHT UNDER THE TRAIN DEPOT. Arnold: SOMETIMES, THE BEST PLACE TO HIDE SOMETHING IS THE MOST OBVIOUS PLACE. Narrator: BRANT HAS BROKERED A MEETING WITH ALEC OLIPHANT, THE CURRENT OWNER OF THE DEPOT. HE HAS GIVEN THEM UNLIMITED ACCESS TO THIS HISTORIC LOCATION. THIS IS THE ORIGINAL FREIGHT DEPOT. AND IT WAS BUILT IN 1850. THE LINE CAME THROUGH IN '51. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A METAL DETECTOR IN NONE OF THESE FLOORS. NO. NEVER BEEN A METAL DETECTOR. LET'S GET OUR STUFF. Arnold: TO GO TO A SPOT THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED IS AS AWESOME AS IT GETS FOR THE SIMPLE FACT YOU KNOW IT AIN'T BEEN MONKEYED WITH AND YOU CAN GO INTO THERE AND GET SOME GOOD CLUES OUT OF THE GROUND. I MEAN, IT'S JUST LIKE STANDING RIGHT HERE. THAT'S A PERIOD RAILROAD SPIKE FROM THE CIVIL WAR LAYING ON THE GROUND. I MEAN, AND THIS IS LAYING OUT HERE IN THE OPEN. WHAT'S GONNA BE UNDER THE BUILDING WHERE NOBODY'S BEEN, NOBODY'S EVER TOUCHED? WE'RE GONNA GO TEAR THE DIRT UP AND FIND SOMETHING. Narrator: THE 40 X 200-FOOT TRAIN DEPOT HAS AN EXTENSIVE CRAWL SPACE BENEATH THE ORIGINAL FLOORBOARDS. IT HAS REMAINED UNTOUCHED SINCE THE $20 MILLION IN TREASURE WAS OFF-LOADED HERE IN 1865. LET'S GET UNDER HERE AND GET DIRTY. LET'S DO IT. TALL MAN FIRST TO COLLECT SPIDER WEBS. OH, YEAH. HEY, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. ** OKAY, GUYS. LET'S GET WITH IT AND SEE WHAT WE CAN PULL OUT OF THIS PLACE. LET'S DO IT. GLASS EVERYWHERE, MAN. THIS IS DANGEROUS. THE GROUND IS COMPLETELY COVERED WITH BROKEN GLASS. I'M GETTING THE GLASS OUT, PIECES OF BRICK OUT. EASY TO GET CUT, STABBED. CAN'T TREASURE HUNT TOMORROW IF WE'RE IN THE HOSPITAL TONIGHT. CONFEDERATE GOLD, WHERE ARE YOU? YES, YES, YES, YES. LOOKY HERE. LOOKY HERE. WHATCHA GETTING, BRANT? HOOYAH! HOOYAH! Narrator: COMING UP... WHAT THE HECK IS THAT? LARRY AND PETE DELVE DEEP INTO THE COVERT SOCIETY OF THE FREEMASONS... Cissna: WHAT IS THIS DOING DOWN HERE IN THIS BASEMENT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. ...AND UNRAVEL A SHOCKING SECRET FROM THE PAST. AND IT COULD BE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. Narrator: IN THE SMALL SOUTH CAROLINA TOWN OF CHESTER, BRANT ARNOLD HAS TRACKED WHAT COULD BE $20 MILLION IN MISSING CONFEDERATE TREASURE TO THIS TRAIN DEPOT. BRANT'S THEORY IS THAT WHEN THE GOLD WAS TRANSFERRED FROM JEFFERSON DAVIS' MONEY TRAIN TO WAGONS, SOME OF IT WAS HIDDEN UNDER THESE TRACKS. YES, YES, YES, YES. AND IT'S STARTING TO LOOK LIKE HE MIGHT BE RIGHT. LOOKY HERE. LOOKY HERE. WHATCHA GETTING, BRANT? THIS IS A DISPENSARY BOTTLE THAT THEY DRUNK OUT OF. DURING PROHIBITION, THEY SOLD IT AS MEDICINE. THAT BOTTLE COULD BE WORTH 800, 1,000 BUCKS. THAT'S A PRETTY SWEET BOTTLE. FINDING AN UNBROKEN BOTTLE LIKE THIS 19th CENTURY BEAUTY TELLS BRANT THAT NO OTHER TREASURE HUNTER HAS EVER EXCAVATED THIS SITE, MEANING IF THE GOLD WAS STASHED HERE IN 1865, IT'S STILL WAITING TO BE FOUND. IRON. ALUMINUM. Narrator: AFTER HOURS OF DIGGING THROUGH NOTHING BUT RUBBLE IN THIS DARK, DANK PIT, THE TEAM WEARILY ADMITS DEFEAT. WE DONE DUG MOST EVERYTHING FROM THESE DOORS, TWO DOORS UP. WE AIN'T COME UP WITH NOTHING OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. Arnold: WE AIN'T GETTING NO HITS HERE. THAT THERE'S THE SURFACE SAND OF THE ORIGINAL SURFACE. THERE'S NOTHING UNDER THE CENTER'S HEART OF THIS BUILDING. SO IT AIN'T EVEN WORTH OUR TIME SITTING HERE. GET OUT OF HERE. IT'S ON TO THE NEXT SPOT. WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW THE PATH OF THE WAGON TRAINS TO WHERE THE TREASURE GUARDS WAS AND TRY TO FIND THE CAMPS THAT THEY CAMPED ON WHEN THEY LEFT HERE. LET'S CHECK OUT THESE MAPS. BRANT IS A CIVIL WAR HISTORY BUFF AND A CONFEDERATE TROOP MOVEMENT EXPERT. RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE TREASURE GUARDS MAY HAVE LEFT CHESTER WITH 1.5 TONS OF GOLD AND SILVER IN AN 11-WAGON CARAVAN. AT FULL SPEED, BRANT ESTIMATES THEY COULD'VE TRAVELED A MAXIMUM OF 18 MILES A DAY. WE KNOW THERE WAS ANOTHER TRAIN DEPOT OVER HERE. YEAH, THEY WERE HEADED TO. THAT'S A LOT OF COVERING LAND BACK IN THOSE DAYS. ESPECIALLY WALKING THEM HORSES AND PULLING WAGONS. I THINK THERE MIGHT BE AN ARTESIAN SPRING RIGHT IN HERE, AND THAT COULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO CAMP. THAT'S RIGHT. LET'S GO GET 'ER DONE. Narrator: HALF A MILE ACROSS TOWN, LARRY CISSNA AND PETE ELES SEARCH THE ABANDONED RECORDS VAULT OF THE LOCAL MASONIC TEMPLE. WHAT, ARE YOU HOLDING UP THE FREAKING THING, MAN? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? RELAXING. YOU'RE NOT EVEN HELPING ME. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A CONNECTION BETWEEN JEFFERSON DAVIS AND ANY FELLOW MASONS IN THE AREA THAT HE COULD'VE SAFELY HIDDEN THE TREASURE WITH. WHAT IS THIS THING? DUDE, WHATEVER THIS IS, IT'S FALLING APART. LOOK. SEE? IT'S BROKE RIGHT HERE. SO OBVIOUSLY, YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL WITH IT, MAN. YOU GONNA TEAR IT UP. IT'S A PICTURE. WHAT THE HECK IS THAT? KEEP ROLLING IT. YEAH. THIS THING IS, LIKE, FALLING APART. YOU GOT TO HOLD IT WITH ONE HAND OR SOMETHING DOWN HERE. THIS THING IS HOLDING ON BY A THREAD. IT'S GEORGE WASHINGTON. THAT SURE IS. HE WAS A MASON. YEAH. HE WAS THE HEAD MASON, I IMAGINE. SHOWS THAT THE FOUNDERS OF OUR COUNTRY ALL HAD MASONIC TIES. Narrator: GEORGE WASHINGTON IS ARGUABLY THE MOST NOTABLE FREEMASON IN HISTORY. DURING THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE, SECRET MEETINGS WERE REGULARLY HELD AT MASONIC LODGES BY MEMBERS OF THE REVOLUTION. HE EVEN USED MASONIC SYMBOLS TO SEND SECRET MESSAGES DURING THE WAR. HERE, WE HAVE A PORTRAIT OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, WHO WAS A MASON... I KNOW THAT. WHAT IS THIS DOING DOWN HERE IN THIS BASEMENT IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. THE CONNECTION HERE, ONE OF HIS PRIMARY GENERALS THAT SERVED WITH HIM, NATHANAEL GREENE, ACTUALLY OWNED PROPERTY IN CHESTER COUNTY. REALLY? Cissna: THAT GENTLEMAN, NATHANAEL GREENE, IS A VERY PROMINENT NAME. AND IF IT'S IN THIS AREA... HIS HOMESTEAD... THAT'S WHERE WE WANT TO GO. NATHANAEL GREENE HAD PROPERTY HERE, BETWEEN HERE AND THE BROAD RIVER. THESE TROOPS THAT LEFT HERE DURING THE CIVIL WAR HEADED THAT DIRECTION AND CROSSED THE BROAD RIVER IN A FERRY. WE'RE GONNA GO TO NATHANAEL GREENE'S PROPERTY, AND WE'RE GONNA CHECK IT OUT. THAT IS A GREAT LEAD AND COULD BE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. Narrator: WHILE LARRY PURSUES HIS FREEMASON THEORY, BRANT BELIEVES THAT THE TREASURE LIES SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CAMPSITE OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE GUARD. YOU KNOW, TRACY, IF THIS IS A CAMP UP HERE, IT'S NOT DOCUMENTED. SO THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT COULD BE THERE. SO WHATEVER WAS THERE WHEN THE SOLDIERS LEFT IT COULD STILL BE THERE. THIS IS IT. TO PROVE HIS THEORY, BRANT NEEDS TO PLACE THE TREASURE GUARD AT THIS REMOTE SITE. ALL IT TAKES IS ONE CONFEDERATE RELIC TO COME OUT FROM AROUND THAT SPRING, AND WE KNOW THEY WERE THERE. Arnold: HAS ANYBODY THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THEM OTHER BOYS IS DOING RIGHT NOW? MAYBE THEY'RE HAVING SOME LUCK. IF THEY HAVING LUCK, WILL THEY TELL US, THOUGH? THAT'S WHAT IT ALL BOILS DOWN TO. YOU THINK LARRY'S GONNA LET US KNOW IF HE'S DIGGING GOOD? HE'S GOT TO, 'CAUSE HE'LL JUST LAUGH. YOU KNOW THAT LAUGH. I'VE HEARD IT A MILLION TIMES. OH, YEAH. REALLY? YEAH. [ IMITATES LARRY'S LAUGH ] Arnold: ME AND TRACY DON'T NEED NOBODYS TELLING US HOW TO DO THINGS OR WHEN TO DO THINGS. I'M NOT GONNA FOLLOW LARRY AROUND TOWN AND RIDE HIS COATTAILS. I'M GONNA GO WITH MY THEORY. WE GOT THIS HORSE BY THE REINS. WE CAN DO IT ON OUR OWN. Short: LET'S DO IT, FELLAS. LET'S FIND SOMETHING GOOD. WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW IS I'M LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF CAVALRY TROOPS. THIS'D BEEN A GREAT PLACE FOR THE GUARD TO STOP AND WATER THEIR HORSES, TAKE A REST. WELL, I'M LIKING THIS TONE RIGHT HERE. Narrator: COMING UP, WITH ONE TEAM BETTING EVERYTHING ON THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE GUARDS' ELUSIVE CAMPSITE... HEAD BACK THIS WAY! WHATCHA GOT, BRO? ...THE OTHER DISCOVERS A MYSTERIOUS SYMBOL THAT MAY JUST POINT THEM TOWARDS $20 MILLION IN LOST GOLD. PETE, I'VE BEEN DIGGING 30 YEARS AND NEVER SEEN NOTHING LIKE THAT. MASONRY DATES BACK INTO THE MID-1700s. YOU TAKE A VOW AT THE ALTAR TO HELP ALL OTHER BROTHER MASONS. TO DO SOMETHING TO BREAK THAT VOW WOULD HAVE SOME SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. Cissna: BACK THEN, IF YOU DID DO SOMETHING BAD WITHIN THE BROTHERHOOD, I'VE EVEN ACTUALLY READ WHERE THEY WERE NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN. THAT DID HAPPEN IN NEW YORK. IT'S REFERRED TO AS THE MORGAN AFFAIR WHERE A MAN, UNDER FALSE PRETENSES, BECAME A MASON JUST SO THAT HE COULD DIVULGE WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE MASONIC MEETINGS. AND THE BROTHERS KIDNAPPED HIM. AND THE BEST BELIEF IS THEY TOOK HIM INTO CANADA ACROSS FROM NEW YORK. HE WAS NEVER SEEN AGAIN. Narrator: IN CHESTER, SOUTH CAROLINA, TWO TEAMS OF CIVIL WAR TREASURE HUNTERS ARE SEARCHING FOR $20 MILLION OF LOST CONFEDERATE GOLD. NEW CLUES HAVE LED THEM DOWN TWO DIFFERENT PATHS, BUT BOTH MAY BE CLOSER TO THE TREASURE THAN ANYONE IN HISTORY. WELL, I'M LIKING THIS TONE RIGHT HERE. BRANT ARNOLD IS FOLLOWING HIS THEORY THAT THE TREASURE WAS STASHED ALONG A WAGON TRAIL SOUTH OF THE CHESTER TRAIN DEPOT. HE HAS LED FELLOW HUNTERS TRACY SHORT AND EARL MESIMER TO WHAT HE THINKS IS AN OLD CONFEDERATE CAMPSITE WHERE THE REBEL GOLD COULD'VE BEEN HIDDEN. SHOTGUN BRASS. THAT'S MODERN BRASS. IT AIN'T NOTHING PERIOD. Narrator: UNFORTUNATELY, ALL THEY UNEARTH ARE MODERN-DAY SHOTGUN SHELLS AND BULLETS. THE EVER-PRESENT SHOTGUN SHELL. IF I'D KNOWN HOW MANY OF THEM I WAS GONNA DIG UP, I WOULDN'T HAVE SHOT SO MANY OF THEM WHEN I WAS GROWING UP. TWO SHOTGUN SHELLS AND ONE MODERN RIFLE BULLET IS ALL I DUG. EARL? THINK WE'RE BEATING A DEAD HOG. I AGREE. TRACY, HEAD BACK THIS WAY! WHATCHA GOT, BRO? 12th GEORGIA'S, .30-06s, AND .22 BULLETS. I THINK WE'RE WASTING OUR TIME, BRO. YEAH. I AIN'T GETTING NOTHING UP HERE BUT SHOTGUN SHELLS. Arnold: YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT THIS PLACE RIGHT HERE WAS GONNA BE A GOOD SPOT WITH THE WATER TOWER BEING THERE. BUT THIS TIME, IT WAS A BUST. SO I GUESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO PUT SOME SALT AND PEPPER AND HOT SAUCE ON OUR CROW AND GO EAT IT. ** Narrator: FIVE MILES TO THE WEST, LARRY CISSNA, PETE ELES, AND DAN YARRUSSO HAVE TAKEN THEIR SEARCH FOR THE MISSING REBEL GOLD IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DIRECTION... A FORMER COTTON PLANTATION 20 MILES OUT OF TOWN ONCE OWNED BY NATHANAEL GREENE, ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FREEMASONS IN THE AREA. THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PLACES, ONE OF THE BEST LEADS WE'VE HAD IN THIS AREA SO FAR. SOUNDS LIKE A REAL EXCITING PLACE TO MAYBE FIND SOMETHING GOOD. Narrator: THE GREENE FAMILY WOULD'VE BEEN LOYAL TO FELLOW MASON JEFFERSON DAVIS. THEY COULD'VE HELPED THE CONFEDERATE PRESIDENT IN HIS TIME OF NEED. SO THIS IS A PERFECT SPOT. IT'S IDEAL. IT'S OFF THE BEATEN PATH TO MANY PEOPLE BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE RIGHT HERE. BUT THAT'S OUR LITTLE SECRET. Eles: LOOKS LIKE A MONSOON'S FIXING TO HIT US. I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET SOAKED. Cissna: THIS AIN'T GONNA SLOW US DOWN. THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE, PETE. ARE YOU VAL? YES. PETE ELES. NICE TO MEET YOU. PETE? YES, SIR. Narrator: THE 300-ACRE PROPERTY IS STILL OWNED BY THE GREENE FAMILY. VAL GREENE, A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF NATHANAEL GREENE, HAS LIVED HERE HIS ENTIRE LIFE AND GREW UP HEARING TALES OF THE LOST REBEL GOLD. VAL, YOU LOOK FOR THIS GOLD? WELL, OF COURSE I LOOKED FOR THE GOLD. I AIN'T CRAZY. THE WAGON TRAIN HAULING THE GOLD SOUTH CAMPED NEAR THE PLANTATION ON THE NIGHT OF APRIL 13, 1865. LARRY THINKS THIS REMOTE SECTION OF THE PROPERTY WOULD'VE BEEN THE IDEAL SPOT TO LIGHTEN THE LOAD. THIS IS ABOUT AS FAR OFF THE BEATEN PATH AS YOU CAN GET. Yarrusso: HEY, PETE. PETE. HANG ON A MINUTE. YOU SEE THAT TREE RIGHT THERE? Eles: WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS A WEIRD-LOOKING TREE. DUDE, HOW IN THE HELL DID THAT GROW LIKE THAT? YEAH. LET'S GET OUT AND LOOK AT THIS. I GOT TO SEE THIS UP CLOSE. PETE, I'VE BEEN DIGGING 30 YEARS AND NEVER SEEN NOTHING LIKE THAT. [ MUMBLES ] YOU EVER SEEN THAT? NO. Narrator: DAN HAS SPOTTED A MARKER TREE, AN OLD AMERICAN INDIAN TRICK TO MARK PATHS AND SECRET LAIRS. THIS TECHNIQUE WAS LATER ADOPTED BY THE SETTLERS. HEY, VAL, BASICALLY, FROM WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT HERE ON THIS MARKER, WHICH WAY'S THE HOUSE? THE HOUSE IS RIGHT STRAIGHT DOWN THERE. SO THIS IS BASICALLY POINTING TO THE HOUSE. YES. THIS MYSTERIOUS TREE, ALTERED BY MAN, IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE LEADS LARRY TO ONE CONCLUSION... IT MUST POINT DIRECTLY TO MILLIONS IN REBEL GOLD. NOW, I PUT MYSELF BACK IN THEIR SHOES. THEY GOT HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN GOLD. YOU NEED A LAND MARKER TO BURY IT AND HIDE IT SO YOU CAN COME BACK AND GET IT. THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE. YOU DON'T GET NO BETTER THAN THAT. Narrator: 20 MILES OUTSIDE CHESTER, SOUTH CAROLINA, LARRY CISSNA AND AN ELITE GROUP OF TREASURE HUNTERS HAVE TRACKED THE REBEL GOLD TO THIS REMOTE PLANTATION. NOBODY'S EVER BEEN AROUND THESE HOUSES. A MYSTERIOUS MARKER TREE HAS LED THEM HERE TO THE CRUMBLING REMAINS OF A CIVIL WAR-ERA HOUSE WHERE MORE THAN $20 MILLION OF CONFEDERATE TREASURE COULD BE HIDDEN. IF YOU STAND BACK HERE, YOU CAN SEE THE WHOLE OUTLINE OF THIS HOUSE RIGHT HERE. THERE'S THAT OLD HAND-FORGED BRICK. OH, YEAH. THE CHIMNEY'S RIGHT THERE. THAT'S THE END OF IT. SO THIS IS KIND OF A GOODY SPOT. THEY SPENT MOST OF THEIR LIFE IN THE WINTER AROUND THE CHIMNEY. IF THIS CONFEDERATE GOLD HAD COME THROUGH HERE, IT'S GONNA BE WITHIN THEIR LIVING QUARTERS, I PROMISE YOU, 'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA KEEP THAT CLOSE TO THEM SO NOBODY CAN TAKE IT OR STEAL IT. Narrator: IF DAVIS' MEN DID USE THE MARKER TREE TO POINT TO THE HIDING SPOT OF THE REBEL GOLD, ONE OF THE BIGGEST MYSTERIES IN AMERICAN HISTORY MIGHT FINALLY BE SOLVED. I THINK WE START WITH THE BACKHOE. LET'S LOCATE THE BEAM. AND JUST GO IN. WHEN YOU CROSS IT WITH THAT BACKHOE... WE'LL BE ABLE TO FIND IT. WE'LL BREAK IT. WE'LL BREAK IT. BUT WE'LL KNOW IT. WELL, I'LL START RIGHT THERE AND COME RIGHT THROUGH HERE. OKAY. AND JUST DO A STRAIGHT LINE. WE'LL BACK UP AND GO TILL WE HIT IT. YEAH. Narrator: AS THE FIRST TREASURE HUNTERS TO EVER SEARCH THIS RUINED HOUSE, LARRY IS CONFIDENT THAT HE AND HIS TEAM ARE ON THE VERGE OF A MAJOR FIND. Cissna: WHOO! DAN-O! READY TO GET IN THERE. SEE THAT BRICK DOWN THERE? LOOK. THAT WAS ALL THE WAY DOWN THERE IN THAT SOIL RIGHT THERE. NOW HE'S GETTING DOWN TO THE RIGHT DEPTH. NOW HE'S GETTING DOWN TO THE GOODY. GO CHECK THAT SOIL FOR ME. WITH THE FOUNDATION REVEALED, DAN LISTENS FOR THE SIGNAL THAT INDICATES PRECIOUS METAL. ** YOU GET ANYTHING, DAN? NAH. WE GOT A LITTLE PIECE OF CHINA OUT OF THERE. THAT'S ABOUT IT. NOTHING IN THERE? NO. THIS IS JUST A MESS, MAN. DAMN IT. Narrator: DESPITE THE ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE FIRST TO SEARCH THIS STORIED VIRGIN SITE, LARRY AND TEAM COME UP EMPTY. IT'S A CRUSHING BLOW. JUST TURNED OUT TO BE A DAMN BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. ** I SEE A TRUCK COMING. Eles: WHO IS IT? TRACY. I SEE HIS JEEP. YEAH. THEY A LITTLE LATE TO THE PARTY. WHAT PARTY? Short: HEY. I DON'T KNOW HOW IN THE WORLD Y'ALL GOT BACK IN HERE. I SENT A BIRD FLYING THROUGH THE AIR WITH A GPS. [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: AFTER TWO FAILED SEARCHES IN TWO OF CHESTER'S MOST PROMISING LOCATIONS, THE GROUP REASSESSES THEIR HUNT. ALL AGREE THAT THE CONFEDERATE GOLD WAS NOT BURIED IN OR AROUND CHESTER, SOUTH CAROLINA. IT MUST'VE CONTINUED SOUTH WITH JEFFERSON DAVIS. I THINK WE SCRATCHED THIS AREA PRETTY MUCH OFF THE LIST. Yarrusso: WELL, I THINK THE LOCATION WE OUGHT TO GO TO IS DOWN NEAR WASHINGTON, GEORGIA. AS DAVIS FLED SOUTH WITH UNION TROOPS IN HOT PURSUIT, HE STOPPED IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, THE LAST PLACE THE $20 MILLION IN REBEL GOLD WAS REPORTEDLY SEEN BEFORE HIS CAPTURE. I'D LIKE TO CHECK THAT PLACE OUT. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I READ ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW, THEY SAID THEY FOUND GOLD ALONG SOME OF THEM ROADS, YOU KNOW, AND THEY... IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT'S WORTH CHECKING OUT. YEAH, AND I'VE ALSO READ WHERE EVERYBODY THAT'S EVER BEEN A TREASURE HUNTER HAS BEEN THERE AT LEAST 10 TIMES. YOU KNOW, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO CHECK IT OUT WHEN WE GET DOWN THERE. Arnold: TYPICAL LARRY. QUIT DISAGREEING WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT THE GROUND AND SAY, "AH, HECK. THERE'S NOTHING HERE," AND WALK OFF. YOU'VE ACTUALLY GOT TO TAKE YOUR TIME AND LOOK IN SPOTS TO SEE FOR A FACT SOMETHING'S NOT THERE TO CHECK IT OFF THE LIST. HOLD ON. HOLD ON. I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM MY BUDDY. HE LIVES IN WASHINGTON. HE KNOWS I'M UP HERE. HE GOES, "GOT SOME NEW INFORMATION FOR YOU ABOUT THE TREASURE IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA." I GUESS HE GOT A PICTURE. "CHECK OUT THESE COINS. I'LL MEET YOU AT THE CALLAWAY PLANTATION IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA." THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING. ACCORDING TO LEGEND IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS THE LAST PLACE THE GOLD WAS SEEN AND BEING DIVIDED UP. SO, YOU KNOW, BEHIND EVERY LEGEND, THERE IS SOME TRUTH. AND SO WE'VE GOT TO GO THERE. I'M STARTING TO FEEL GOOD AGAIN. AFTER A LONG DAY OF THIS, MAN, THIS IS REALLY GREAT NEWS. ** Narrator: ON THE NEXT "REBEL GOLD," BRANT AND LARRY DEVELOP TWO CONFLICTING THEORIES AS TO THE LOCATION OF THE LOST CONFEDERATE TREASURE... OUR PURPOSE HERE IS TO FIND WHERE THIS TREASURE WAS STOLEN. SOME OF IT WAS LEFT HERE SO THE SOUTH COULD RISE AGAIN. ...TAKING THESE ELITE TREASURE-HUNTING TEAMS TO UNDISCOVERED CORNERS OF THE MAP. Arnold: TRACKING THIS TREASURE DOWN IS JUST LIKE PUTTING A PUZZLE TOGETHER. Y'ALL DON'T LET ME GO, OKAY? ALL RIGHT. IT'S GONNA GET DEEP. Narrator: THEY TURN UP CLUES THROUGH THE WRECKAGE OF AMERICA'S SORDID PAST... OLD STONE AND THE BRICK MIXED IN WITH IT. THAT'S DEFINITELY PART OF THE FOUNDATION RIGHT THERE. ...AS THE PRESSURE MOUNTS... WE DID THIS IN RUSSIA. WE CAN DO IT AT HOME. LET ME FINISH. Narrator: ...BIG EGOS COLLIDE... PEOPLE AREN'T DOING THINGS THE WAY I THINK THEY SHOULD BE DONE. WHO IN THE HELL'S LEADING THIS THING? Narrator: ...AS ALL SCRAMBLE TO FINALLY FIND... TARGET'S RIGHT HERE. IT'S BIG, HUGE. MIGHT FIND SOME MONEY IN THESE SUCKERS, MAN. ...THE LOST REBEL GOLD. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
