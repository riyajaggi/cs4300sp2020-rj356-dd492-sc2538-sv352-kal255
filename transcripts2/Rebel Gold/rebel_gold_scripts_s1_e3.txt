 WORTH OVER $13 MILLION. OUR PURPOSE HERE IS TO FIND WHERE THE HEIST TOOK PLACE WHEN THIS TREASURE WAS STOLEN. TWO TEAMS... YOU KNOW, NOBODY SAID FINDING $20 MILLION WORTH OF GOLD WAS EASY. IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. YOU'RE GONNA WORK FOR IT. ...BOTH WITH STRONG LEADERS... WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOME STUFF TODAY. TODAY IS DO-OR-DIE. ...HUNT OFF THE BEATEN PATH... - [ BLEEP ] ...ON A HISTORIC HUNT FOR THE LOST REBEL GOLD. HOO-YEAH! HOO-YEAH! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, TWO TREASURE HUNTERS BELIEVE THEY'RE CLOSER THAN EVER TO FINDING CONFEDERATE TREASURE THAT HAS BEEN LOST SINCE 1865. BRANT ARNOLD, A PROFESSIONAL RELIC HUNTER FROM TENNESSEE, HAS BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THE LOST REBEL GOLD FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS. TRACKING THIS TREASURE DOWN IS JUST LIKE PUTTING A PUZZLE TOGETHER. SOMETIMES A PIECE WON'T FIT. BUT A LOT OF TIMES EVERYTHING FITS TOGETHER AND EVERYTHING ROLLS JUST AS SMOOTH AS SILK. Narrator: HE BELIEVES THE KEY TO FINDING THE TREASURE LIES IN TRACKING DOWN THE CAMP SITES OF THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS THAT WERE ASSIGNED TO PROTECT IT. I REALLY THINK YOU HIT THEM CAMPS, THERE'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY OF FINDING TREASURE THAT THEY HAD DUMPED A LITTLE BIT OF IT OFF. Narrator: LARRY CISSNA, THE OWNER OF A THRIVING RELIC BUSINESS IN TEXAS, HAS A DIFFERENT THEORY. AFTER SEARCHING FOR 32 YEARS, LARRY BELIEVES THE ONLY WAY TO FIND THE TREASURE IS TO FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF THE LEADER OF THE CONFEDERACY, JEFFERSON DAVIS. HE COULD HAVE DROPPED IT OFF WITH... WITH A PERSON OR TWO ALONG THE WAY THAT... THAT HE FELT COMFORTABLE WITH OR HE TRUSTED, SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START THINKING LIKE HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT. WE'LL FIND THE GOLD. WE'RE ON IT. Narrator: BOTH TEAMS HAVE ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, THE LAST PLACE THE GOLD WAS SEEN MORE THAN 150 YEARS AGO. MAY 3, 1865... JEFFERSON DAVIS AND HIS CABINET ARRIVE IN WASHINGTON, THE END OF THE LINE FOR THE MONEY TRAIN. DESPERATE TO OUTWIT THE UNION ARMY THAT'S IN HOT PURSUIT, DAVIS SPLITS UP THE TREASURE. ONE PORTION, $450,000 WORTH OF CONFEDERATE GOLD, IS LEFT IN THE LOCAL BANK. ANOTHER PORTION STAYS WITH THE TREASURE GUARD, TO BE PAID OUT TO THE REMAINING TROOPS, WHILE JEFFERSON DAVIS AND HIS ENTOURAGE TAKE THE REST AND FLEE SOUTH. JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS, BRANT ARNOLD AND FELLOW TREASURE HUNTER TRACY SHORT ARE ON THEIR WAY TO A FORMER ANTEBELLUM PLANTATION. BRANT IS AFTER THE PORTION OF THE GOLD THAT WAS WITH THE TREASURE GUARD. HE DOESN'T BELIEVE ALL OF THE TREASURE WAS PAID OUT, AND THINKS SOME OF IT MAY BE HIDDEN AT THIS SITE. I KNOW 100 YARDS FROM HERE WAS THE TRAIN DEPOT, WHICH WAS THE LAST PLACE THE GOLD WAS UNLOADED FROM TRAIN. AND I THINK THE TREASURE GUARD WAS RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT WE'RE AT. Narrator: BY THE TIME DAVIS ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON, HIS 3,000 TREASURE GUARDS HAD DWINDLED TO JUST 150 ELITE KENTUCKY CAVALRYMEN. IF BRANT CAN FIND EVIDENCE THE KENTUCKY CAVALRY CAMPED AT THIS SITE, HE'LL KNOW HE'S ON THE RIGHT PATH TO FINDING THE GOLD. Brant: WE'RE HOPING WE CAN FIND A CLUE TO TELL US IF THERE WAS ANY CAVALRY HERE, WHAT CAVALRY GUYS THAT WAS HERE. Narrator: BUT AFTER COMING UP SHORT IN CHESTER, SOUTH CAROLINA... SHOTGUN BRASS. IT'S MODERN BRASS. IT AIN'T NOTHING PERIOD. ...BRANT IS RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO PROVE HIS THEORY. IF WE FAIL, WE FAIL BECAUSE I MADE A MISTAKE. AND I'M THE ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE AN ASS TO EVERYBODY. Narrator: MEETING BRANT TO HUNT FOR SIGNS OF THE KENTUCKY CAVALRY ARE TREASURE HUNTERS EARL MESIMER AND MIKE SCOTT. [ BEEPING ] MIKE, AN EQUIPMENT SPECIALIST, HAS DOUBTS ABOUT BRANT'S THEORY. Mike: I'M NOT 100 PERCENT SOLD. NO OFFENSE TO... TO TRACY, EARL, AND BRANT, BUT I THINK BRANT WILL JUMP TO A CONCLUSION. AND HE CONVINCES THE OTHER GUYS FAIRLY EASILY THAT HE'S RIGHT. I'M THE VOICE OF REASON HERE. I'M THE ONE THAT CAN MAKE PEOPLE REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS BLACK OR WHITE. - HEY, GUYS. - YEAH, BRO. I HEAR THAT EXCAVATOR. Narrator: TO FIND EVIDENCE OF THE TREASURE GUARD, IT'S CRITICAL THAT EVERYONE WORKS TOGETHER. BUT AFTER WEEKS OF FAILURE, THE TEAM IS STARTING TO IMPLODE. SO YOU DON'T WANNA DEAL WITH THE SCRAPER, OR JUST GONNA TAKE THE DIG IN THE DIRT... WELL, I JUST TAKE THE BUCKET... BUCKET, AND JUST SCRAPE IT LIGHTLY? JUST CUT IT, THAT WAY YOU SET IT OFF TO THE SIDE. BECAUSE THE SCRAPER... HOW WE USUALLY DO IT IS... 'CAUSE I'VE DONE THIS, WE... IT'S LIKE A TRENCHING, YOU KNOW? YOU'LL SCOOP ONE AND PILE IT OVER. THEN YOU CAN HUNT THE PILE AND THE HOLE. THEN THE NEXT SCOOP GOES IN THE HOLE, SO YOU CAN HUNT THAT PILE IN THE HOLE. THE WAY I'VE ALWAYS DONE IT, WE'VE ALWAYS SCRAPED IT. - YEAH. - NAH, NAH, NAH. LET'S NOT... YEAH, BUT IF YOU GO TO JUST DIGGING WITH THE BUCKET, YOU'RE DIGGING TOO BIG OF A HOLE. Narrator: MIKE, A PROFESSIONAL TREASURE HUNTER FROM WISCONSIN, HAS TASTED SUCCESS BEFORE, FINDING MILLIONS IN GOLD AND SILVER ON DIGS AROUND THE WORLD. Mike: YOU KNOW, FOR ME, IT'S FRUSTRATING WHEN I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE DOING THINGS THE WAY I THINK THEY SHOULD BE DONE. I DON'T LIKE FOR THINGS NOT TO GO MY WAY, ESPECIALLY WHEN I FEEL I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING AS FAR AS CHASING TREASURE. SO, FOR ME, IT'S DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M A LEADER. I MEAN, WE DID THIS IN RUSSIA. WE EXCAVATED AN OLD CHURCH, AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID, IS WE DUG... THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE DO IT AT HOME. LET ME FINISH. ARCHAEOLOGISTS WILL USUALLY DO TRENCHES. I MEAN, AND NOT THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS RIGHT, BUT IT'S... IT'S MORE SYSTEMATED BECAUSE THEN YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SECTIONS. - LET'S... LET'S LET HIM GET IT. LET'S GET STARTED. MIKE'S REAL STRONG OPINIONED AND WANTS TO BE A LEADER, BUT THE FACT IS, HIS EGO IS LIKE A PIT BULL LOOKING FOR A STEAK. Narrator: IF BRANT CAN'T PROVE THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK SOON, IT WILL BE EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF. WHO IN THE HELL IS LEADING THIS TEAM? THREE MILES TO THE WEST, LARRY CISSNA AND HIS TEAM ARE ON THEIR WAY TO THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF WASHINGTON TO CHASE DOWN THEIR OWN THEORY. CISSNA BELIEVES JEFFERSON DAVIS ENTRUSTED A PORTION OF THE TREASURE TO WEALTHY SUPPORTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY. WE'RE ON A HUNCH THAT SOME OF IT WAS PROBABLY LEFT HERE SO THE SOUTH WOULD RISE AGAIN, SO TO SPEAK. Narrator: COINS THAT TRACE BACK TO THE MISSING TREASURE WERE RECENTLY DISCOVERED NEAR THE HISTORIC CALLOWAY PLANTATION BY A PAIR OF LOCAL TREASURE HUNTERS. BECAUSE OF THESE EXCITING NEW FINDS, LARRY HAS SECURED THE RIGHT TO SEARCH THE PROPERTY. HE COULD HAVE STASHED SOME GOLD HERE. HE REALLY COULD HAVE. Narrator: THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION WAS RECENTLY PURCHASED BY JEFF AND STEPHANIE MACCHIA. THEY'RE AWARE OF THE LEGEND OF THE MISSING REBEL GOLD, BUT HAD NO IDEA THAT SOME OF THE TREASURE COULD ACTUALLY BE BURIED ON THEIR PROPERTY. POINTS OF INTEREST, OKAY? UH, SLAVE QUARTERS? - MM-HMM. - OKAY. WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE FALSE FLOORS, OF COURSE. AND MAYBE A PRIVY, UH, THE... THE TRASH PIT. WELL, WE KNOW WHERE A COUPLE SLAVE HOUSES WERE. WHICH I'LL TAKE YOU AND SHOW YOU IF YOU WANT TO SEE 'EM. Narrator: THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION ORIGINALLY SPANNED 1,152 ACRES. BUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, MOST OF THE HISTORIC STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN TORN DOWN. LITTLE REMAINS BEYOND THE MAIN HOUSE. MAN, THAT OLD ORIGINAL WOOD. YOU SEE THEM BIG OL' NAILS STICKING UP? LOOK AT 'EM. THAT'S JUST LOOKING FOR A FOOT. BASED ON HIS PAST CIVIL WAR FINDINGS, LARRY THINKS THEIR BEST BET IS TO LOCATE THE OLD SLAVE QUARTERS. PULL. DON'T PULL MY ASS DOWN. PULL! BUT IN THE DENSE, OVERGROWN WOODS, IT'S A DAUNTING TASK. HEY. AH, THERE WE GO. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S AN OLD BRICK RIGHT THERE. - YOU FOUND THAT RIGHT THERE? - YEAH. OOH! OLD STONE WITH BRICK LINKED IN WITH IT, BUT THAT'S DEFINITELY PART OF THE FOUNDATION RIGHT THERE. Narrator: TO PROVE THIS IS THE ORIGINAL SLAVE QUARTERS, THEY HAVE TO DIG DOWN BELOW THE FOUNDATION TO UNEARTH EVIDENCE THAT THE GOLD COULD HAVE BEEN HERE. - SO, WHAT'S YOUR GAME PLAN? - ME AND PETE, WE'LL... WE'LL COME BACK HERE WITH A BACKHOE, OKAY? WE'LL TAKE A SCRAPE HERE. YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE G.P.R., RIGHT? I'LL TAKE THE G.P.R. MAYBE RUN THE DETECTOR, TRY TO GET SOME IRON READINGS, OKAY? SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. WE HAVE A SHOT AT FINDING SOME OF THIS GOLD POSSIBLY. I MEAN, WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANY ROCK UNTURNED. WE'RE GONNA LOOK A FEW PLACES HERE AND SEE WHAT WE CAN TURN UP. Narrator: JUST 3 MILES AWAY... BRANT AND HIS TEAM ARE LOOKING FOR HARD EVIDENCE THAT THE KENTUCKY CAVALRY, THE PROTECTORS OF A PORTION OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE, ONCE CAMPED ON THIS ANTEBELLUM PLANTATION. BRANT'S THEORY IS THAT THE TREASURE GUARD MAY HAVE HIDDEN THE GOLD NEARBY. JUST 3 TO 5 INCHES, NELSON. Narrator: THEY'VE BROUGHT IN AN EXCAVATOR TO SCRAPE AWAY THE TOP LAYER OF DIRT AND REMOVE ANY MODERN-DAY TRASH THAT COULD GIVE THEIR DETECTORS FALSE POSITIVES. - BOY, HE'S GOOD WITH THAT THING. - YES, HE IS. HE COULD FILLET A FISH WITH THAT. [ LAUGHS ] LET ME GET THIS HUNTED OUT. [ BEEPING ] THAT SOUNDS LIKE A SOLID SIGNAL. WHAT IS IT? DOOR HINGE? A STRAP HINGE, PROBABLY OFF ONE OF THE DOORS OFF THE SLAVE QUARTERS. NOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. BRASS RING. YOU GOT A BRASS RING? BRASS CIRCLE, LET ME CLARIFY MYSELF. - IS IT A GROMMET? - YEAH, IT'S A GROMMET. BRASS GROMMETS WENT ON TARPS AND WENT ON TENTS JUST TO TIE A ROPE THROUGH. THAT'S A GOOD ONE. Narrator: THIS FIND SUPPORTS BRANT'S THEORY THAT THE TREASURE GUARDS MAY HAVE CAMPED ON THIS VERY SPOT AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME TO AN END. IT'S A BIG PLUS WITH A NEW CLUE. IF THEY CAN DETERMINE THAT THE TROOPS THAT SLEPT HERE WERE IN FACT FROM THE KENTUCKY CAVALRY, THEY MAY BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO FINDING THE LOCATION OF THE GOLD. COMING UP, BRANT AND TEAM MAKE AN UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY... YOU CAN BET YOU BUTT IF YOU GO FIND THEM LUBE GROOVE ENFIELDS, YOU'RE IN A TENNESSEE CAVALRY SPOT. A CLUE THAT COULD FOREVER CHANGE HISTORY. MEANWHILE, GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR REVEALS A HIDDEN CAVERN BENEATH THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION. ALL RIGHT. LET ME DOWN MORE. Narrator: BUT TO EXPLORE IT, LARRY IS FORCED TO RISK BEING BURIED ALIVE. - IT'S SOFT, BRO. - IS IT? THAT'S, LIKE, IT COULD COLLAPSE ON ME. ** Narrator: IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, ON THE GROUNDS OF AN ANTEBELLUM PLANTATION, BRANT ARNOLD AND HIS TEAM ARE SEARCHING FOR CLUES THAT COULD LEAD THEM TO THE LOST REBEL GOLD. YEAH, JUST PUT IT RIGHT IN THAT HOLE NEXT TO IT. THE TEAM HAS ALREADY FOUND EVIDENCE OF A CONFEDERATE CAMP. NOW THEY'RE LOOKING FOR CIVIL WAR RELICS THAT WILL PROVE IT WAS USED BY THE KENTUCKY CAVALRY, THE GUARDS WHO PROTECTED THE TREASURE BEFORE IT VANISHED. COME BACK IN. IF THEY FIND WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR, IT COULD LEAD TO MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST CONFEDERATE TREASURE. WE GOT A BULLET! EARL, YOU WANNA COME CHECK IT OUT? YEAH. EARL'S A BULLET EXPERT. SO, HERE YOU GO, BUD. KIND OF LOOKS LIKE WHAT THEY CALL A ENFIELD. IT'S A LITTLE SHORTER THAN AN REGULAR ENFIELD. ALL RIGHT. DURING THE CIVIL WAR, SOLDIERS MELTED LEAD AND POURED IT INTO CAST IRON MOLDS TO MAKE THEIR OWN BULLETS IN THE FIELD. WITH OVER 1,000 UNIQUE DESIGNS, COLLECTORS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC REGIMENTS BY THE PATTERNS THEY FIND IN THE LEAD. EVERY PIECE TELLS A STORY OF WHAT TYPE OF SOLDIER WAS THERE AND WHICH BRIGADES WERE CAMPED IN SUCH AND SUCH A PLACE. YOU KNOW, BATTLEFIELD THEY FOUGHT ON. MIKE HAS PULLED A RABBIT OUT OF HIS HAT AND... AND GOT US ON A GOOD CLUE. Narrator: THIS LUBE GROOVE ENFIELD BULLET WASN'T USED BY THE KENTUCKY CAVALRY. IT WAS USED BY TROOPS FROM BRANT'S HOME STATE, TENNESSEE. IT'S DEFINITELY TENNESSEE CAVALRY. YOU'RE PRETTY SURE OF THAT, EH? I'M 100 PERCENT POSITIVE OF THAT. THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT HAD THEM, THOUGH. WELL, THE TENNESSEE GUYS ARE. YOU CAN BET YOUR BUTT IF YOU GO FINDING LUBE GROOVE ENFIELDS, YOU'RE IN A TENNESSEE CAVALRY SPOT. EARL, YOU AGREE WITH THAT? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I MEAN, I... I'VE BEEN DIGGING CIVIL WAR RELICS THAT SELL FOR 32 YEARS, AND IT'S THE FIRST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN. Narrator: ACCORDING TO BRANT'S EXTENSIVE RESEARCH, THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY WAS NEVER IN WASHINGTON. JEFFERSON DAVIS RELEASED THEM OF DUTY IN ABBEVILLE, GEORGIA, 30 MILES TO THE NORTH. IT'S A FUNNY THING THAT THEY WAS IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, SAME PLACE THAT THE GOLD WAS STOLE FROM. IT COULD GIVE US A WHOLE NEW APPROACH TO FINDING THIS TREASURE. ON MAY 24, 1865, A PORTION OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS LEFT IN A WASHINGTON BANK WAS CONFISCATED BY UNION TROOPS AND SENT NORTH TO RICHMOND ALONG A SECRET ROUTE. BUT IT NEVER ARRIVED. ACCORDING TO RECORDS, THE UNION ESCORT STOPPED TO CAMP AT THE CHENNAULT PLANTATION. THAT NIGHT, THEY WERE ROBBED. NEARLY A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GOLD AND SILVER COINS VANISHED. TODAY, IT WOULD BE WORTH OVER $13 MILLION. NO ONE KNOWS WHO COMMITTED THE ROBBERY, AND ONLY A PORTION OF THE TREASURE HAS EVER BEEN RECOVERED. BUT BRANDT IS CONVINCED THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THE LUBE GROOVE BULLET IS A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT. RIGHT NOW, I THINK THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY UNIT TOOK THIS TREASURE. BRANDT NOW BELIEVES THIS LOCATION WAS USED AS A CAMP SITE BY THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY, POSSIBLY BEFORE ROBBING THE UNION SOLDIERS AT THE CHENNAULT PLANTATION. IF BRANT CAN FIND EVIDENCE OF THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY AT THE SITE OF THE ROBBERY, HE'LL HAVE SOLVED A 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY. I'M HOPING TO GO TOWARDS THE CHENNAULT PLANTATION TO FIND THE EXACT SPOT THE TREASURE WAS STOLEN FROM AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND WHAT TROOPS ACTUALLY WAS THERE THAT TOOK THE GOLD. Narrator: THREE MILES NORTHWEST, LARRY CHASES HIS OWN THEORY. HIS BET... JEFFERSON DAVIS LEFT A PORTION OF THE TREASURE WITH FRIENDS OF THE CONFEDERACY AT THE ONCE-GREAT CALLOWAY PLANTATION. HE'S DISCOVERED THE FOUNDATION OF THE OLD SLAVE QUARTERS, A SPOT HE KNOWS FROM EXPERIENCE WAS OFTEN USED TO HIDE VALUABLES. HE'S CALLED IN AN EXCAVATOR TO DIG FOR CLUES, OR EVEN THE TREASURE ITSELF. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS... SEE WHAT YOU JUST DID? WE'RE GONNA DO THAT ALL THE WAY ACROSS ABOUT 4 FEET. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] [ CLATTER ] WHAT WAS THAT? A BOTTLE? I SEE IT, THE WHOLE BOTTLE, RIGHT HERE. I SEE IT STICKING OUT. OH, THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM IN HERE. Narrator: THE EXCAVATOR HAS HARDLY SCRATCHED THE SURFACE, AND IT'S ALREADY REVEALED A TREASURE TROVE OF CIVIL WAR-ERA BOTTLES. SO BASICALLY WHAT THESE... WHAT THESE BOTTLES ARE TELLING ME, WE MAY HAVE A SHOT AT FINDING SOME OF THE GOLD. Narrator: THROUGHOUT HIS YEARS IN THE TREASURE HUNTING BUSINESS, LARRY HAS HEARD SEVERAL STORIES OF CIVIL WAR GOLD AND COINS FOUND IN GLASS BOTTLES AND JARS. WE MIGHT FIND SOME MONEY IN THESE SUCKERS, MAN. MIGHT BE SOME COINAGE IN 'EM. YOU NEVER KNOW. BURIED MONEY. - THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE. - WHERE? - A WHOLE ONE. - YEAH, THAT'S A BIG JAR. A BIG OL' JAR. A LITTLE DIFFERENT, AIN'T IT? - MM-HMM. THAT'S OLD! IT SORT OF LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING'S IN IT. WILL IT BE MONEY IN IT? NO. THERE AIN'T NOTHING IN THERE. WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOME TREASURE. YOU KNOW, BOTTLES ARE NICE, BUT WE WANT SOME LOOT. Narrator: THE BOTTLES ARE FROM THE RIGHT PERIOD, BUT NONE ARE FILLED WITH ANYTHING OF VALUE. ONE THING MISSING HERE, HONESTLY... IS ALL THE RIGHT STUFF. ABOUT ALL WE'RE GONNA GET. I GUESS WHAT WE'LL DO IS GET UP HERE AND SEE WHAT DAN'S DOING. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HE'S USING THAT G.P.R., THE GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR. MAYBE HE'LL FIND SOMETHING OVER THERE. HE'LL GET SOMETHING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO UP THERE. - LET'S GO. Narrator: BACK AT THE MAIN HOUSE, DAN USES THE LATEST IN TECHNOLOGY TO LOOK DEEP INTO THE PLANTATION GROUNDS. MY JOB IN THIS SITE IS GONNA BE TAKE THAT G.P.R. UNIT, THE GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR, SCAN THAT BACKYARD OF THE HOUSE. Narrator: GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR, OR G.P.R., BLASTS RADIO WAVES HUNDREDS OF FEET BELOW THE SURFACE AND MEASURES HOW THE SIGNAL BOUNCES BACK. UNDISTURBED EARTH RETURNS A UNIFORM SIGNAL. ANY ANOMALIES IN THE SOIL, AND THE RADIO WAVES BOUNCE IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS. THE G.P.R. DISPLAY SHOWS AN EXPERIENCED TREASURE HUNTER ANY AREAS OF DISTURBED GROUND THAT COULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD BURIED TREASURE. Dan: I'M STARTING TO PICK IT UP ON THE EDGE HERE. THERE'S DEFINITELY DISTURBANCE. Narrator: WHILE SCANNING THE PERIMETER OF THE PROPERTY, DAN GETS A MASSIVE HIT. THAT'S DEFINITELY AN AREA WE WANT TO CHECK OUT. HE DETECTS A DISTURBANCE THAT GOES DOWN 20 OR MORE FEET, MORE THAN DEEP ENOUGH TO HIDE A LARGE QUANTITY OF GOLD. GOTTA GO DOWN ABOUT 5 INCHES OR SO, AND WE'LL HAVE A LOOK AT IT. LOOK AT THAT FALL DOWN THERE. YOU SEE THAT? - YEAH. - IT JUST FELL. DUDE, THE WHOLE GROUND JUST CAVED IN. DAMN! THERE'S SOMETHING DOWN THERE, PETE. WE'RE GONNA KEEP GOING TILL WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT. LET'S SEE WHAT IT IS. - BIG OL' HOLE BACK THERE. - YOU SEE IT? - YEAH. - YEAH, I SEE. OH, CRAP. LOOK AT THAT. IT GOES... THAT'S A TUNNEL BACK IN THERE, BROTHER. THERE'S BOTTLES DOWN THERE AND PIPES, ALL SORTS OF CRAP. Narrator: TO EXCAVATE THE SITE, THEY'LL HAVE TO USE EXTREME CAUTION. WITH A CAVERNOUS SPACE BELOW, THE WEAKENED TOPSOIL IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CAVE-INS. Larry: ALL RIGHT, LET ME DOWN MORE. OKAY. Narrator: ONE WRONG STEP COULD SEND LARRY PLUMMETING 20 FEET, TRIGGERING HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF DIRT TO CAVE IN ON HIM. - IT'S SOFT, BRO. - IS IT? THAT'S LIKE IT COULD COLLAPSE ON ME. COMING UP, LARRY TAKES HIS CHANCES, HEADING FACE FIRST INTO AN UNSTABLE PIT THAT COULD BE LOADED WITH GOLD. IT'S GONNA GET DEEP. MEANWHILE, BRANT AND HIS TEAM HUNT FOR CLUES OF A 150-YEAR-OLD CIVIL WAR ROBBERY. LET'S PULL OUR MACHINES OUT AND HUNT THIS ROAD LINE AND EVERYTHING BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HAVE LEFT SOMETHING. Narrator: IF THEY CAN FIND OUT WHO COMMITTED THE CRIME, THEY'LL BE ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE GOLD. THE TARGET'S RIGHT HERE. IT'S BIG. HUGE. ** Narrator: IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA... OH, CRAP. LOOK AT THAT. IT GOES... THAT'S A TUNNEL BACK IN THERE. ...LARRY CISSNA AND HIS TEAM HAVE UNCOVERED A DEEP PIT HE BELIEVES COULD BE HIDING MILLIONS IN LOST CONFEDERATE GOLD AND SILVER. LARRY'S ABOUT TO FIND OUT HOW FAR DOWN THIS MYSTERIOUS CAVERN GOES. Larry: ALL RIGHT. LET ME DOWN MORE. Y'ALL DON'T LET ME GO, OKAY? - ALL RIGHT. NOW, DON'T GO FALLIN' 20 FOOT DOWN SOME DAMN SHAFT 'CAUSE I'VE SEEN 'EM LIKE THAT. Narrator: THIS HOLE COULD DESCEND MORE THAN TWO STORIES. AND BECAUSE THE GROUND HAS BEEN DISTURBED, IT'S LOOSE AND UNSTABLE. ANY WRONG MOVE, AND THE WALLS COULD GIVE WAY. -[ GRUNTS ] - IT'S SOFT, BRO. - IS IT? THAT'S LIKE IT COULD COLLAPSE ON ME. Narrator: IF THE GROUND GIVES WAY, HUNDREDS OF POUNDS OF DIRT COULD CAVE IN ON HIM. BUT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT THIS HOLE HOLDS THE MISSING REBEL GOLD. PROBABLY STILL KEEPS GOING. HEADS UP! A PIECE OF BRICK. HOW'S THAT? BUT JUST 6 FEET DOWN... Larry: I'M ABOUT POSITIVE THAT THIS IS THE WALL. Narrator: LARRY HITS A DEAD END. DAMN! THINK YOU HITTING THE BOTTOM ALREADY? I DO. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING DOWN ANY FURTHER, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. 150 YEARS AGO, THIS PIT WAS LIKELY USED AS AN OUTHOUSE, AN EXCELLENT HIDING SPOT FOR VALUABLES. BUT IF ANY TREASURE WAS HIDDEN HERE, IT'S LONG GONE. [ SPITS ] ALL I GOT OUT OF THIS WAS A MOUTHFUL OF PETRIFIED [BLEEP]. Narrator: THOUGH THE PIT IS EMPTY, LARRY'S NOT READY TO GIVE UP ON THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION JUST YET. NOW, ARE WE MISSING ANYTHING? I MEAN, CAN YOU THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE MISSING OR THAT WE CAN LOOK AT? THERE IS A LITTLE OL' PLACE ON THE... ACROSS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD, THERE'S A LITTLE OL' HOUSE OVER THERE. YOU EVER POKED AROUND IN IT ENOUGH TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SQUARE NAILS... I'VE FOUND A SQUARE NAIL OR TWO OVER THERE. REALLY? THERE YOU GO. GOLD. WELL, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? Narrator: AN OLD, DILAPIDATED HOUSE MAY BE LARRY'S LAST CHANCE TO FIND THE REBEL GOLD. I DON'T WANT BRANT, TRACY, AND EARL'S NAME ON THAT BOOK THEY FOUND THE GOLD, I WANT OUR NAME ON THERE. IT WILL... WILL BE... AT ALL COSTS. ...BEFORE IT'S OVER, I PROMISE YOU IT WILL BE. WE'LL BE THE ONES TO FIND IT. - MY THEORY'S RIGHT. I MEAN, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT IT'S STILL OUT THERE. SO, WE'LL CONTINUE TO MOVE ON AND WE'LL FIND IT. Narrator: 13 MILES NORTHEAST... BRANT ARNOLD AND HIS FELLOW TREASURE HUNTERS TRACY SHORT AND EARL MESIMER ARE INVESTIGATING A CRIME THAT HAPPENED OVER 150 YEARS AGO... THE THEFT OF NEARLY A QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS IN CONFEDERATE GOLD, NOW WORTH AS MUCH AS $13 MILLION. NOW WE KNOW OUR PURPOSE HERE IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, IS TO FIND WHERE THE HEIST TOOK PLACE, WHERE THIS TREASURE WAS STOLEN. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND THIS BUSHWACKERS CAMP. BUSHWACKERS WAS UP HERE. LET'S PULL OUR MACHINES OUT AND HUNT THIS ROAD LINE. THEY MIGHT HAVE LOST SOMETHING. Narrator: THE THIEVES BEHIND THE ROBBERY HAVE NEVER BEEN IDENTIFIED, BUT BRANT HAS A HUNCH IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GROUP OF MEN FROM HIS HOMETOWN, THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY, LED BY CAPTAIN JAMES WILLIAM IRWIN. THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY WAS OFFICIALLY DISMISSED IN SOUTH CAROLINA, BUT BRANT HAS FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE INEXPLICABLY HERE IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA. COULD THEY HAVE STOLEN BACK THE CONFEDERATE GOLD IN A DARING MIDNIGHT RAID? Brant: IT WAS A REAL MESSY ROBBERY, DUE TO THE FACT KEGS BEING BUSTED OPEN AND SADDLEBAGS BUSTING OPEN AND GOLD FLYING EVERYWHERE. IN THE HAVOC OF THE ROBBERY, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF THINGS DROPPED. Narrator: TO FIND OUT ONCE AND FOR ALL, BRANT AND HIS TEAM ARE AT THE REPORTED SCENE OF THE CRIME, THE HISTORIC CHENNAULT PLANTATION. [ HORSES WHINNY ] THE TREASURE HUNTERS SPLIT UP TO SWEEP THE SURROUNDING LAND, LOOKING FOR ANY EVIDENCE THAT CAN HELP THEM IDENTIFY THE MARAUDERS, OR EVEN TRACK DOWN ANY GOLD THEY MAY HAVE LEFT BEHIND. THEM GUYS THAT LEFT, TRYING TO GET HOME FAST, YOU'RE GONNA LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF COINS. AND SOME OF THEM PROBABLY THOUGHT IN THEIR MIND, "WELL, SOMEDAY I'LL COME BACK HERE." HOW MANY PEOPLE EITHER DIDN'T EVEN MAKE A RETURN TRIP BACK, GOT HOME AND GOT SICK AND DIED? HOW MANY GUYS FORGOT WHICH TREE THEY BURIED STUFF UNDER? Narrator: IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OLD WAGON ROAD, BRANT'S MACHINE GETS A PROMISING HIT. [ BEEPING ] YOUR TARGET'S RIGHT HERE. IT'S BIG, HUGE. [BLEEP], I DON'T GIVE UP. BOYS, I GOT A BUCKET. HOW OLD IS THAT BUCKET? I DON'T KNOW. [ BREATHES RAGGEDLY ] GLASS! THERE'S GLASS IN IT? LET ME SEE THE GLASS. - IT'S GOT A GOOD COLOR TO IT. - THAT'S A SIGN. IT'S THE RIGHT COLOR, AND IT COULD VERY WELL BE GLASS FROM 1860. Narrator: THE PRESENCE OF CIVIL WAR-ERA RELICS ON A LONG LOST WAGON ROAD ARE A GOOD SIGN. THE TRAIL COULD LEAD THEM TO THE SITE OF THE FABLED ROBBERY. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE STICK WITH THIS ROAD BED 'CAUSE WE KNOW FOR A FACT THE TREASURE COME DOWN THE ROAD BED. Narrator: BUT BEFORE THEY CAN INVESTIGATE ANY FURTHER, SOMETHING ELSE IN THE ROAD STOPS THEM IN THEIR TRACKS. HOLD UP, EARL. THAT'S A RATTLESNAKE, BOYS. OH, HELL NO. THIS BAD BOY WILL [BLEEP] YOU UP IN A HEARTBEAT. HE'S COILING UP! WATCH OUT! THAT MAKES ME UNEASY AS HELL ABOUT BEING IN THIS GROWED UP STUFF IN HERE, BECAUSE AS FAR AS WE ARE FROM THE VEHICLES, IT'D HAVE BEEN HELL GETTING A MAN OUT OF HERE. LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. Narrator: DESPITE THE FACT THAT SNAKES ARE EVERYWHERE IN THESE WOODS, BRANT IS ON A MISSION TO PROVE THAT THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY STOLE $13 MILLION WORTH OF CONFEDERATE GOLD AND FIND IT ON THIS CIVIL WAR-ERA PLANTATION. 13 MILES TO THE SOUTHWEST ON THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION, LARRY AND HIS TEAM STILL HOPE TO PROVE LARRY'S THEORY THAT DAVIS STASHED THE LAST OF THE CONFEDERATE GOLD HERE ON HIS WAY SOUTH. THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO HIDE SOME VALUABLES. IT'S KIND OF OUT OF THE WAY, ISN'T IT? - UP ON A HILL, TOO. - YEAH. Narrator: AFTER COMING UP EMPTY ON THE OUTHOUSE DIG, THEY HAVE ONE LAST LOCATION TO SEARCH... A CABIN FROM THE 1850s. THEY COULD HAVE USED THIS FOR SLAVE QUARTERS. IN THE TEAM'S EXPERIENCE, OLD CABINS LIKE THESE USUALLY HAD FALSE FLOORS WHERE VALUABLES WERE HIDDEN BACK IN THE DAY. EVERY TIME WE OPEN UP SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IT'S LIKE OPENING UP A LITTLE TREASURE CHEST. SO WE'LL SEE WHAT THIS ONE HOLDS. HOWEVER, EXCAVATING THIS SITE WON'T BE EASY. WE GOT OUR WORK CUT OUT FOR US HERE. THOUGH IT'S BEEN STANDING 150 YEARS, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE IT'LL STAND MUCH LONGER. LOOK HOW CROOKED THIS THING IS! LEANING HERE. LEANING THERE. LEANING THERE. THAT'S NUTS. THAT ROOF COMES DOWN ON US, WE'RE DONE. MAKES YOU WONDER IF YOU'RE GONNA PULL THE WRONG TOOTHPICK OUT, DON'T IT? MM-HMM. WE NEED TO GET SOME OF THIS CRAP OUT OF THE WAY. [ BLEEP ] DAMN! DID THAT BOARD REALLY FALL ON YOUR HEAD? HELL YEAH. IT DIDN'T FALL ON MY HEAD. IT FELL ON MY SHOULDER. IF IT FELL ON MY HEAD, YOU'D BE DOING THIS BY YOURSELF. [ BOTH LAUGH ] Narrator: DESPITE THE DANGER, LARRY AND PETE START RIPPING UP THE FLOORBOARDS, DETERMINED TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S A HIDDEN COMPARTMENT UNDERNEATH. UGH, I'M TRYING TO GET IT UP UNDER. HOLD IT UP RIGHT THERE FOR A MINUTE. THERE YOU GO. IT'S GOT 13 POUNDS OF DIRT ON IT. [ GRUNTING ] YOU KNOW, NOBODY SAID FINDING $20 MILLION WORTH OF GOLD WAS EASY. IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. YOU'RE GONNA WORK FOR IT. AH! COMING UP, COMPETITION HEATS UP AS THE TWO TEAMS RACE TO FIND THE CONFEDERATE TREASURE. - YOU KNOW WHAT RUNNER-UP IS? - YEAH. - IT'S THE FIRST LOSER. - YEAH. I'M NOT GONNA LOSE TO BRANT! WITH PRESSURE MOUNTING, LARRY PUTS HIS ENTIRE TEAM AT RISK IN A CABIN ON THE BRINK OF COLLAPSE. WE'LL BE FINDING SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT? I JUST HIT SOMETHING HARD, BOYS. IT MIGHT BE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. AND AS THE TEAM LOSES CONFIDENCE IN HIS LEADERSHIP, BRANT FACES A MUTINY. BRANT'S RESEARCH IS WRONG, AND, UH, I'M THINKING PRETTY HARD ABOUT JUMPING SHIP. ** MAKE SURE THAT'S FACE DOWN NOW. THAT'S GOT NAILS STICKING UP. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT THAT. I AM. I DON'T WANT US STEPPING ON IT. DON'T BE GOING OVER NEAR THAT PILE. THIS IS WHERE YOU WATCH FOR COPPERHEADS AROUND HERE, BUBBA. YEP. THERE HE IS! LOOK AT HIM SQUIRRELLING AROUND HERE. THAT'S A SALAMANDER OR A LIZARD. THERE HE GOES. LOOK AT HIM. LOOK AT HIM SQUIRRELLING AROUND. LOOK AT THAT LITTLE GUY RIGHT THERE. COME ON. GIVE HIM TO ME. I'M GONNA GET HIM OUT OF HERE. AH! [ LAUGHING ] THAT'S A BIG OL' LIZARD, MO. WOO! HEY, YOU AIN'T GONNA DO THAT WHEN YOU SEE A BIG COTTONMOUTH OR A RATTLER PULL OUT FROM UNDER THERE, ARE YOU? I SCARED YOU. BUT IT WAS A LIZARD! ...WHAT IT WAS, IT WAS GROSS. YOU THOUGHT HE WAS TYRANNOSAURUS REX, DIDN'T YOU? FELT LIKE IT. [ LAUGHS ] THAT WAS A BIG OL' SUCKER, WASN'T IT? HELL YEAH. Narrator: VETERAN TREASURE HUNTERS LARRY CISSNA, PETE ELES, AND DAN YARRUSO ARE AT THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION IN SEARCH OF GOLD THAT LARRY BELIEVES JEFFERSON DAVIS MAY HAVE STASHED FOR SAFEKEEPING AS HE FLED SOUTH. - [ GRUNTING ] - THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO. Narrator: AFTER STRIKING OUT AT TWO OTHER LOCATIONS, THIS 1850s CABIN IS THE TEAM'S LAST HOPE OF FINDING THE TREASURE IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA. THE PLAN IS TO GET UNDER THE OLD FLOOR WHERE THE VALUABLES WERE OFTEN HIDDEN. WORK BACK THAT WAY AND THEN I CAN BE FILLING IN AS WE'RE WORKING BACK. HOW'S THAT DIRT? GOOD? YEAH, IT'S WORKING. Narrator: TO PROVE HIS THEORY, LARRY WILL NEED TO FIND EVIDENCE OF A HIDDEN COMPARTMENT. WE'LL, WE'RE FINDING SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT? I JUST HIT SOMETHING HARD, BOYS. IT MIGHT BE WHAT WE LOOKING FOR. A FOUNDATION. MAYBE. [ CLUNKS ] LET'S SEE WHAT THAT IS, MAN. WHAT IS THAT? GIVE ME A FLASHLIGHT. [ SCRAPING ] IT'S HARD, THOUGH. I CAN TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. AH, HELL. [ CHUCKLES ] A CAR PART? [ SIGHS ] Narrator: THE CABIN MAY BE FROM THE RIGHT ERA, BUT THE RELICS AREN'T. THAT'S IRON, MO. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT DOING HERE? PLOW PART, AIN'T IT? THAT'S WHAT IT IS. IT'S A BIG OL' PLOW PART. HOW THE HELL DID THAT GET UNDER THERE? I DON'T KNOW. WE SHOULD HAVE ALREADY FOUND GLASS BUTTONS AND DEFINITELY SOME BUSTED POTTERY AND GLASS... WE'RE NOT FINDING THAT AT ALL. SO IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD. Narrator: LARRY'S THEORY THAT JEFFERSON DAVIS HID GOLD ON THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION HAS BEEN PROVEN WRONG. LET'S GET THIS STUFF OUT OF HERE. I'M BEEN REALLY DISAPPOINTED IN WHAT WE'VE COME UP WITH SO FAR. BUT WHAT KEEPS ME GOING IS THAT $20 MILLION IN GOLD AND SILVER IS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE. Narrator: 13 MILES NORTH, BRANT AND HIS TEAM HAVE BEEN SEARCHING THE GROUNDS OF THE CHENNAULT PLANTATION, LEGENDARY SCENE OF THE CONFEDERATE GOLD ROBBERY. BRANT IS DESPERATELY HUNTING FOR SIGNS OF THE TENNESSEE CAVALRY. IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT IT WAS TENNESSEE CAVALRY THAT DONE IT, WE CAN FIGURE OUT RIGHT EXACTLY WHERE THAT PART OF THE TREASURE THAT WAS STOLEN IS LOCATED. Narrator: BUT SO FAR THE TEAM HASN'T FOUND ANY EVIDENCE OF A MILITARY PRESENCE, OR THE ROBBERY. JUST KEEP PUSHING TILL WE CAN'T PUSH NO MORE. WE'VE BEEN TRACING THIS ROAD, UH, FROM WHERE... RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE CHENNAULT PLANTATION. AND THAT'S SUPPOSEDLY WHERE THE GOLD WAS STOLEN FROM. AND, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT FINDING ANYTHING TO KEEP OUR HOPES UP. IT'S... IT'S KIND OF WORKING ON ALL OF US. COME ON, BABY. GIVE ME SOME EVIDENCE, HARD EVIDENCE. THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TODAY. IT'S BEYOND FRUSTRATION. IT'S... WE CAN'T FIND IT IF IT AIN'T THERE. WHY AIN'T THERE BEEN A BUTTON COME FROM HERE? WHY AIN'T THERE BEEN THIS? WHY AIN'T THERE BEEN THAT? SIMPLE FACT IS, THERE AIN'T BEEN [BLEEP] TO COME OFF THIS PROPERTY BECAUSE THERE AIN'T [BLEEP] ON THIS PROPERTY. ALL I GOT TO SAY IS, I HATE TO CALL BULL[BLEEP], BUT I CALL BULL[BLEEP] ON THIS ONE. IF THE ROBBERY TOOK PLACE ON THIS PLANTATION AS WRITTEN, THERE WOULD BE EVIDENCE OF IT LEFT BEHIND. BRANT NOW BELIEVES THAT THE HISTORY BOOKS ARE WRONG. FAIRY TALES AND GHOST STORIES. WE'RE ON THE WRONG PIECE OF DAMN LAND. BRANT REALLY IS KNOWLEDGEABLE, BUT, UH, BRANT'S RESEARCH WAS WRONG. AND, UH, I'M THINKING PRETTY HARD ABOUT JUMPING SHIP. DONE HAD A [BLEEP] UP DAY. I'M HURTING ALL OVER. LET'S GET THE HELL BACK TO OUR VEHICLES. TREASURE HUNTING CAN BE FRUSTRATING AS HELL, BUT TEMPER TANTRUMS AIN'T GONNA GET YOU NO DAMN WHERE. YOU GOT TO PICK YOURSELF BACK UP ON YOUR FEET AND DIG IN WITH ALL YOU GOT. Narrator: AFTER COMING UP EMPTY AT THE CALLOWAY PLANTATION, LARRY CISSNA AND HIS TEAM NOW BELIEVE JEFFERSON DAVIS MUST HAVE KEPT HIS GOLD WITH HIM AS HE FLED WASHINGTON. THEY'VE TRAVELED TO THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN TO THE LAST CAMPSITE WHERE DAVIS AND HIS ENTOURAGE STAYED ON THEIR WAY SOUTH. I TRULY BELIEVE THEY STILL HAD SOME OF THE CAVALRY WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE WATCHING OVER GOLD THAT I KNOW HE STILL HAD WITH HIM, 'CAUSE THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS LEAVING HERE WAS TO GET TO TEXAS AND TO CONTINUE THE CIVIL WAR. SO IF WE CAN GO OUT HERE AND FIND A CLUE, LIKE A BULLET OR A BUTTON, ANYTHING THAT WOULD GIVE EVIDENCE THAT THEY WERE HERE, WE KNOW FOR A FACT THAT THAT GOLD LEFT WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, ON ITS WAY TO IRWINVILLE... WHERE HE WAS CAPTURED. HAVEN'T FOUND ANYTHING YET. FOUND SOME JUNK. THAT'S COMMON RIGHT HERE WHERE WE'RE AT. [ BEEPING ] LARRY! PETE! WHAT? COME HERE! I GOT A BULLET. WHOO! YEAH? YEAH. WHAT IS IT? WE GOT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. Narrator: DAN HAS UNCOVERED A RICHMOND LAB BULLET, A BULLET MANUFACTURED DURING THE CIVIL WAR IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, WHERE DAVIS AND HIS GUARDS WERE STATIONED BEFORE FLEEING SOUTH. NOW, LOOK. THAT BULLET WAS MADE IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA. WHAT'S IT DOING DOWN HERE? WE KNOW WHY. WE'RE IN WASHINGTON, GEORGIA. OKAY? WHO LEFT RICHMOND, VIRGINIA? JEFFERSON DAVIS. STARTING TO MAKE THE GREASE STICK NOW, DAN. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. IF YOU DUG THAT RIGHT HERE, THERE GOTTA BE SOMETHING ELSE AROUND HERE. YEAH. IF WE'RE GONNA FIND THE GOLD, WE NEED TO SEE CLUES LIKE THAT. NOW THEY'VE GOT A GREAT SHOT AT FINDING IT. HEY! COME HERE, LARRY. Narrator: JUST AS LARRY AND HIS TEAM'S LUCK STARTS TO CHANGE... LARRY, COME HERE. ...AN UNEXPECTED VISIT FROM A LOCAL SUDDENLY PUTS THEM HOT ON THE TRAIL OF THE TREASURE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOU WALKING OVER HERE AND SHOWING ME THAT RIGHT THERE. Narrator: ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, LARRY CISSNA AND HIS TEAM ARE HUNTING THE LAST CAMPSITE WHERE DAVIS AND HIS ENTOURAGE STAYED BEFORE FLEEING SOUTH. THEY FOUND AN OLD RICHMOND LAB BULLET, A CLUE THAT DAVIS WAS ONCE HERE AND MAY HAVE LEFT TOWN WITH HIS GUARDS AND THE TREASURE. [ BEEPING ] BUT OUT OF NOWHERE, A LOCAL MAN SHOWS UP WITH MORE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE. A GENTLEMAN JUST CAME OVER HERE AND BROUGHT ME SOMETHING HE FOUND OVER THERE IN HIS BACKYARD OVER THERE. THINK THAT'S ENOUGH CLUE WE'RE IN THE RIGHT AREA? THAT'S AWESOME RIGHT THERE. HUH? THAT'S GOOD RIGHT THERE. YOU FOUND THAT IN YOUR BACKYARD? THAT'S CONFEDERATE. RIGHT OVER HERE, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN NEAR THAT BARN, I FOUND A $20 GOLD PIECE. $20 GOLD PIECE, YOU FOUND WHERE? PROBABLY 100 YARDS RIGHT THROUGH YONDER. THAT SEALS THE DEAL FOR ME. Narrator: FOR LARRY, THE GOLD PIECE AND THE CONFEDERATE BELT BUCKLE ARE ROCK-SOLID PROOF THAT THE GOLD WAS WITH DAVIS WHEN HE LEFT TOWN. FROM WASHINGTON, GEORGIA, DAVIS FLED THE PURSUING UNION ARMY SOUTH TO IRWINVILLE, WHERE HE WAS CAPTURED SIX DAYS LATER, PENNILESS. LARRY HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE GOLD MUST BE HIDDEN SOMEWHERE ALONG DAVIS' ESCAPE ROUTE. SO, WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN? WE'RE GOING DOWN THAT WAY? UNLESS YOU WANT TO SIT AROUND HERE AND DIG BULLETS ALL DAY. FOLLOW THAT GOLDEN PATH, MAN. THAT'S THE GOLDEN ROAD. WE KNOW THEY WERE HERE, AND WE KNOW THAT THE GOLD AND JEFF DAVIS WENT THAT WAY. WE GOT TO STAY ON HIM. WE'VE GOT TO STAY ON HIS HEELS. WE'LL FIND HIM. LET'S GO FIND SOME GOLD. TWO MILES AWAY, BACK IN WASHINGTON, BRANT AND TRACY MEET WITH A FRIEND AND LOCAL HISTORIAN, DR. MARK WATERS, CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE THE AUTHORITY ON THE STOLEN CONFEDERATE TREASURE. HE HAS NEW INFORMATION THAT JUST MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY BRANT COULDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF THE QUARTER MILLION DOLLAR THEFT AT THE CHENNAULT PLANTATION. I HEARD YOU GOT SOME... SOME NEW RESEARCH. YEAH. I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO THE MOVEMENT OF THE CONFEDERATE TREASURY FOR SOME TIME NOW, AND, OF LATE, UM, SOME OF THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THE ROBBERY WAS NOT DONE AT THE LEGENDARY SITE, WHICH IS THE JOHN CHENNAULT PLANTATION. THE WRONG PLACE. THIS IS THE BEST DOCUMENT WE HAVE WHICH PLACES THE SITE OF THE ROBBERY. RECENTLY, DR. WATERS CAME ACROSS AN EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT FROM A WOMAN NAMED MARY LANE, DATING BACK TO 1926. HER STORY COULD CHANGE HISTORY. Waters: HER STATEMENT INDICATES THAT IT'S THE DAVID M. MOSS HOUSE WHERE THE ROBBERY TOOK PLACE. EVEN THOUGH THE DAVID MOSS HOUSE DOESN'T STAND TODAY, THE INDICATION IS, FROM THE BANK OFFICIALS AND FROM MARY'S STATEMENT, THAT IT WAS BETWEEN THE ONE THAT'S CURRENTLY STANDING, JOHN D. MOSS... MM-HMM. AND THE LEESTON HOMESITE. IF WE COULD FIND THE MOSS HOUSE, THAT WOULD UNFOLD A 150-YEAR-OLD MYSTERY. OH, EXACTLY RIGHT. WHO DO YOU SUSPECT DONE THIS? WELL, THE REPORT WAS THERE WAS 20 PEOPLE ON HORSEBACK. Narrator: WHILE THE NEW INFORMATION CONFIRMS THAT BRANT AND HIS TEAM HAD BEEN SEARCHING THE WRONG LAND, IT FITS WITH BRANT'S THEORY THAT CAPTAIN IRWIN AND HIS TENNESSEE CAVALRYMEN WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR STEALING THE TREASURE. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE COINAGE. THE GOLD CONTENT IN ONE OF THESE COINS TODAY IS WORTH ABOUT $1,500. SO IF YOU DO THE MATH, $1,500 PER COIN TIMES 8,000 COINS IS 13 MILLION. NOT COUNTING THE VALUE IF IT WAS GOLD FROM THAT ROBBERY. THAT WOULD P... PUT THE COIN VALUE WHO KNOWS? ASTRONOMICAL. WHEW. WE THOUGHT OUR RESEARCH WAS GOING NOWHERE. BUT NOW WE'VE GOT CLUES TO WHO DID IT, WHAT WAS TAKEN, WHERE WE CAN START AT, WHAT DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO IN. AND WE CANNOT LEAVE THIS AREA TILL WE HAVE THE DAVID MOSS LOCATION AND SOLVE THIS 150-YEAR-OLD RIDDLE. ON THE NEXT "REBEL GOLD"... THERE'S SO MANY QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED JUST BY FINDING THAT EXACT LOCATION. Narrator: BRANT AND HIS TEAM FOLLOW UP ON NEW CLUES... I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING DAMN CLOSE. WE JUST GOT TO GET OUR FEET ON THE RIGHT PROPERTY. ...THAT COULD SOLVE THE 150-YEAR-OLD ROBBERY OF 13 MILLION IN CONFEDERATE GOLD... THE CAVALRY BOYS WAS DEFINITELY HERE. SEEMS TO ME LIKE WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRAIL. - YEP. - WHOO! ...WHILE LARRY AND TEAM TAKE THEIR SEARCH TO THE MUDDY DEPTHS OF A RIVER THAT DAVIS CROSSED IN HIS MAD DASH SOUTH. THERE COULD BE $20 MILLION IN GOLD LAYING OUT THERE. HOW YOU GONNA GET IT IF YOU DON'T GET IN THE WATER? Narrator: BOTH TREASURE HUNTERS FIND THEMSELVES ON THE BRINK OF CRACKING ONE OF THE BIGGEST COLD CASES IN AMERICAN HISTORY. Brant: ALL THE BLOOD, ALL THE SWEAT, ALL THE TEARS PINNED DOWN TO THIS MOMENT RIGHT HERE. LOOK AT THAT [BLEEP] RIGHT THERE, BOYS! WHOO! WE IN BUSINESS!
