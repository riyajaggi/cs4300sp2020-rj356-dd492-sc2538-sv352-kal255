 PHIL KEOGHAN: Previously on The Amazing Race... eight teams raced to Asunción, Paraguay. After surviving a U-Turn, Leo and Alana confronted Will and James. We thought, that of the four people cooking... And we thought that you U-Turned us. (laughter) At the Roadblock, the alliance of five continued working together. -How did you do it? - Put it through the hole, and then twist it.

 Will and James's steady balance at the Detour gave them their second win of the season. You are team number one. (laughing): Oh, my God! Meanwhile, DeAngelo and Gary fumbled. This sucks, bro. And in last place, Kaylynn and Haley found a reason to celebrate. -This is a non-elimination leg. - (squealing) It does mean that you're going to face a Speed Bump in the next leg. Eight teams remain. Who will be eliminated next? Ah! (whoops)

 ♪ ♪ "Fly to Paris, France." KEOGHAN:  Will and James will be the first to leave Paraguay, South America, and fly more than 6,000 miles across the Atlantic to Paris, France, home to iconic landmarks and elegant châteaus like the Domaine de Chantilly, where teams will find their first clue, 30 miles outside the city. -Oh, my God. We get to go to Paris. -Paris. Oui-oui. Let's go! -(laughing) -"Drive yourselves to Domaine de Chantilly." WILL:  I'm excited for a self-drive. I know that I'm gonna be the one that's driving, 'cause I know how to drive a stick and I took lessons before the race, and I've done it before when I was younger. The self-drive is really exciting. New element to the race that we haven't had yet. Bonne journée. Bon voyage. VICTORIA: Growing up, we weren't close at all. We're just opposites. I'm the peacekeeper. Michelle tends to lose her temper, and I'd calm her down. But spending time together's been awesome. -Like, we've never ever been this close. -Nope. But communication is key. I'm a little dramatic and emotional, so Victoria's my navigator and I'm just the goer. Oh, God. I'm gonna get blamed for everything. You're not gonna get blamed. I have faith in you. The last time I was in Paris, I was, like, 13 years old and I had a crush on a boy named Steven. This time I'm in Paris and I have a crush on Leo -and he has a crush on me. - We're each other's -current crushes. - (Alana laughs) We're pretty certain that they drive stick shift in France. RILEY: I lived in Europe for five years and I had a stick shift the entire time, so I'm basically fluent in stick shift -at this point. - Yeah. ESWAR: I came to The Amazing Race thinking, like, "This is gonna be a great way for me to showcase my strengths," but I think more, it's highlighted kind of the weaknesses. I don't have any weaknesses. (laughs) We're, like, hoping to get on a really good flight... We're boarding the first flight with Michelle and Victoria, Maddison and Riley. And Will and James. WILL/JAMES:  We're going to France! We'll be landing in Paree by 8:00 tomorrow morning. HALEY: Yeah, we're 15 minutes behind the other flight but we're hoping just to beat them. -We're gonna crush our Speed Bump. -Yeah. KAYLYNN:  We are not leaving today. ♪ ♪ MADDISON:  All right, let's find our cars. Yeah, it is stick shift. Yes, it's a manual. Let's go! We're looking for signs for A1. Whoo, look who's still got it, baby. (engine revving) -JAMES: Baby, you good? - (tires screeching) Oh, he's struggling to get out of first. -(engine revving) - It's all about feeling it out. -Oh, no. - Uh-oh. I can't be stuck behind them. -RILEY: Perfect. Good work. - MADDISON: Let's do it. Okay, now where do I go? (engine revving) -(tires screech) - (groans) -JAMES: Baby, we need to go. - It's not working. -(horn honking) - Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go! Oh, he's struggling. Oh, my God. What are they doing? ALANA: Who's ahead of us? LEO: Someone who can't drive. -ALANA: Will and James? - Yeah, yeah. -They're incompetent. - That's super annoying. -(horn honking) - (engine revving) JAMES: You almost had it, baby. No, I didn't, James. ALANA: Now Riley and Maddison are getting a huge advantage 'cause these boys suck. There's got to be at least one team that doesn't really know how to drive stick. Yeah. -(horns honking) - (engine revving) I need help. MICHELLE: Dude! What are they doing? We need them to move. (horn blaring) What's Leo doing? JAMES: Tell Leo what's happening. We're stuck. WILL: Leo, can you please help me? Can you please help me? -I can help you back up. - Can't we go forward? -I can't get it to change. - LEO: Get out. I'll get you up to the stop sign. LEO: Will and James were a plumbing issue. They clogged the ramp. Get out of the way. We know they U-Turned us, and I was enjoying the image of their misfortune in the parking lot, but our priority was just getting them out of the way. We don't want to be in a position where anyone, including them, thinks that we are being petty or vindictive, but we remember. Baby, we need to go. Just go around, okay? We got to go. Let's go! ALANA: Come on, Leo! VICTORIA: Hurry. Come on. -Are you okay? - No. We need to go. JAMES: Come on, come on. -Deep breaths, baby. - (engine revving) -(shouting) - (tires screech) -(horn honking) - MICHELLE: Let's go, let's go. ALANA: Thank you, Leo. -Go ahead, go ahead. - Oh, my God. -(tires screech) - I'm trying to go to the gas but it's not working! JAMES: Be one with the car, my love. -You got it. - (groans) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I don't know what to do. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ -(engine revving) - You need to focus. Is your foot on the clutch? WILL: Oh. I'm starting in third gear. I was pushing the stick into third gear instead of first gear. -JAMES: Baby, you got this. - WILL: Thank you. JAMES: I love you. It's fine. WILL: And after I figured that out, we were good to go. JAMES: Just keep it easy. We're getting on A1. Good job, Chee. -Which way? - I don't know. Exit. -Yay, we're out of the parking lot. - All right. (engine revving) (tires screech) -Whoa. All right. - Oh, God. Okay. -We're going, we're going. - We're going, awesome. RILEY: All right, here we go. Right here. MADDISON: Wow. This is incredible. Look at this place. ♪ ♪ -Clue box. - Let's do it! -Roadblock. - "Who has an eye for art?" The Château Chantilly is a perfect example of a picture saying a thousand words. An exquisite crown jewel, that has the second largest collection of antique paintings next to the Louvre. This Roadblock gives teams a chance to study them up close, when they try to match a person depicted in one of these paintings with a real-life person who's turned up here to the château for a party. (indistinct chatter) There are nine partygoers that match nine paintings in every detail. Once they make one match, they'll need to make a note of the artist's name to get a clue. -You got this. - Yeah, I got it. I thought Riley would be the best for the Roadblock 'cause he's better at attention to detail. -We're good. - (violins playing) Holy... ♪ ♪ MADDISON: Okay, go for it. You got it. RILEY: I enter the château and... we're in an art museum. There's essentially a party going on and everyone's wearing a bunch of different costumes. -Excusez-moi. -That was quite an experience. Whoa. Wow. Oh, my God, you're kidding me. Come on. With the Roadblock, what you had to do, was look in the art gallery, find a character, match them up with someone in the party, and state who was the painter of that particular character. (exhales) Okay. The problem was, there was so much art in the art gallery, it was just crazy. And I started stressing a little bit. Shoot. That is daunting. There's so many paintings. Okay. -Driving to the countryside. - We are looking for Chantilly. LEO: We're going A1 for Lille. I have faith in our navigator. -VICTORIA: What's Leo doing? - (gasps) They're taking, they're taking a left. Navigation, Victoria. I don't know where I'm going, Victoria. We asked somebody but we only wrote down vague directions. -Uh, well... - Yeah. "Uh, uh, what?" -I'm stopping. - Can you stop being mean like that? JAMES: Leo wasn't very nice. I mean, we used the U-Turn, but it's like, no empathy at all. Which I get, everyone wants to maintain their lead. But he didn't have to be an ass about it. MADDISON: I have a good feeling about Riley going into this. Riley is better at memorizing anything. Hopefully we can keep our lead. RILEY: Most of the people were wearing colors like on the gray scale, and there was a few that were, like, bright red or bright blue, and I thought those would be obvious. So my strategy was I tried to match those two up. Okay. This is nuts. But they just didn't exist in the art gallery. And then I found someone with facial hair. That guy looks familiar. Made sense. (laughs) Guy with the mustache... This guy. Can you come with me? I'll take you to the foyer. The curator? Who's the curator? Oh, you. Carracci? -Carracci. Yes? - You are correct. Ha ha! -Let's go. - Good stuff. This is not your average whipped cream. It's the cream of Chantilly, a culinary delight that dates back to the 18th century. Teams must whip it to perfection so it won't fall out of the bowl, and then fill up four pies. -All right. Let's do it. - Let's go. -"Travel on foot." - I think it's back over there. I don't think any of the teams have showed up yet, -except for us. - No. ALANA: There's Riley and Maddison. -So far. - Just a little further. "Who has an eye for art?" I do. I am an art monster. I am thinking maybe my Master of Fine Arts degree will pay off. Oh, my God, this is incredible. I love museums. I feel really lucky to be in this room right now. -Oh, my God. - It's okay. -(tires screech) - Oh! I don't know how to not get it to do that. Haley and I thought that we could drive a stick shift, but we were very wrong. (engine revving) -(tires screech) - You're doing great. How long do we drive on A1 for? -Okay. Okay. -Merci. -Thank you. - We're not lost anymore. I'm sorry, I just get very frustrated very easily. We haven't seen a Chantilly sign in... -Nah, we haven't. - ...ten, 15 minutes. I'll turn around. -There it is. - Oh. -Hello? - Hello. Ooh, it smells delicious in here. Okay. We had to whip cream on four pies. Now we got to go win first place. We can't even remember the last time that we won something. I think it was a state championship in Hawaii. -2000... - Seven? -Can't really think about that, though. -Yeah. Just got to play our game. It's like golf. -Yeah. - Just play your best game. (ball splashes in water) "Each of you must make two pies." There we go. Dad, I hope we're doing this right. This is kind of physically taxing. MADDISON: I know. Mamma mia. Four pies. Wow. -(groans) - This is no easy task. I would charge $60 for a pie. ALANA: Wow. Okay. Pulzone. Pulzone. Maybe I'll pick this man here with the white pointy collar. Um, we'll see. I'm gonna check to see if he has that ring. 'Cause that's pretty distinct. Um, Pulzone is the name of the painter. So let's go see. (indistinct chatter) I don't see him in here. Um... which is frustrating. LEO: We don't know where we are in the race, but we know that Will and James might still be at the airport, trying to get up the exit ramp. So we're hoping that got us a little bit of an advantage. Unless they somehow really pull it together. WILL: I love you. You got this. -Here we are. - You got it. -Okay. Bye, baby. - Bye. Good luck. JAMES: Holy smokes. You guys made it. (panting) Honestly, I'm sort of amazed. How did you, how did you...? I was starting in third gear. Uh-oh. Okay, that'll do it. Bonjour. Can you come with me, please? Pulzone? -Correct. - Yes! All right. Let's go. JAMES: I want to, like, really take my time and look at all these pictures, but I need to hurry. I'm hoping I can just get in and get out. Welcome to my beautiful home. RILEY: How's this? Ready? It's okay? -ALANA: Hey. Bonjour. - Bonjour. How you doing? ALANA: Changing room. How many pies do you make a day? Geez! Let's see your forearms. (both laugh) -LEO: Use the whisk to whip it. - All right. Maybe we get to smash them in everyone's faces when we're done. JAMES: Okay. François-Hubert. And it's yellow. This is insane. May I bring you with me? Would you like to take my arm? (chuckles) -Are you the curator? - I am. Uh, François-Hubert. -Incorrect. - God. Sorry. Sorry. "Who has an eye for art?" That's you. Which one's speaking to me? Andrea... Oh, hey, girl. Hello. Bonjour. Excuse me. Pardon me. -May I bring you with me, sir? - CHEE: James is done? -On his second guess. - Oh. You got it. Andrea d'Agnolo? -You are correct. - Are you serious? Okay, let's go. Oh, my God, -I can't believe I did it! - Great job, babe. HUNG: I saw probably about 50 people in the party room, dressed very similarly. And so I tried to figure out people who looked different. And then I saw one of the characters looked like Jesus. And so I decided to focus on him. I don't see anybody... That could be him. Hi. Can you come with me? CHEE: Oh. Here's Hung. HUNG: Nicolas Poussin? Correct. -Okay. Was that faster? - That was really quick. -"Who has an eye for art?" You want to do it? - Me. -Hey, guys. -Roadblock. - That's Victoria. I'm glad Victoria's doing this. She has an eye for everything. VICTORIA: So I'm looking for someone who's dressed like the painting. Hopefully this will be quick. HALEY: This doesn't look right. KAYLYNN: I'm thinking that the Chantilly is gonna be in the countryside. -So... stressful. - Yeah. KAYLYNN: I am sweating through my jacket. -We almost... okay. I'm sorry. - Ow! -We suck at driving stick, - (siren wailing) -got super freaking lost... - And we have a Speed Bump. This is bad. KAYLYNN: I'm thinking that the Chantilly is gonna be in the countryside. We were last to leave, so we couldn't have a chance to follow everybody. So Haley and I are on our own. I don't know where the hell I am. -(laughs): Oh, my God. - I'm gonna turn around now. Pour it in and whip it up. BOTH: ♪ Making pies. ♪ RILEY: These two are good? ♪ In our cute little outfits. ♪ Let's make sure we don't drop 'em. Yeah. Oh, inside the tent, he said. -All right. - Hello. Oh! -My God. - Deliver it! -Deliver it. Deliver it! - I delivered it. -Yeah. - Wow. You gotta be kidding me! RILEY: You're holding the pies and, like, one hits you from this side and one hits you from the other side. We're just like, "Do not drop these, 'cause I do not want to whisk another bowl of cream." MADDISON: Yeah. Okay, R-Riley, let's open this. KEOGHAN: Teams must make the one-hour drive back to Paris to this fairground art museum in the neighborhood of Bercy, where they'll receive their next clue. Yield ahead. Let's do it. ALANA: It's a lot of forearm. Whew. CHEE: Burning. HUNG: Push, push, push, push, push. All right, let's go, Riley. When you deliver the pies, they throw pies at you so be careful. They throw pies at you, so be careful, okay? (laughs) They're out. RILEY: We've formulated a little alliance with the boyfriends and Chee and Hung. We genuinely like those two teams. Gary and DeAngelo are also included in that. It's not as strong of an alliance with them. VICTORIA: Okay. I just want to get this done. I'm gonna try two people. APARNA: Hi. Can I take you? To the foyer? -Lampi? - Incorrect. -Incorrect? Okay, thank you. - It's all good, Aparna, keep going. VICTORIA: Oh! Oh. Oh, wait. Excuse me. Hi. Can I borrow you? Can I bring you? Thank you. François-Hubert? -You are correct. - Yes! -Oh, my gosh. - APARNA: Lampi? -Incorrect. - Okay. Thank you. -Sorry about that. (groans) - It's okay, Aparna. DeANGELO: City of Chantilly, we're here! -Finally. - We're here, Gary. -You see the light? - I see the light. HALEY: I think we should take that exit. -Okay. Okay. - A1. Yep. -Come on, Mich. - Coming. -Bonjour. Yes, I can whip. - Hi. (Chee sighs) JAMES: Oh, my God. Aah...! LEO: Careful, careful. Got it with your thumbs? -Ah! - (whooping) Okay. (whoops) That went in my ear. Oh, my God. Whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk, whisk... I'm thinking about somebody that I hate their face. Stab it. Hate. Hold them close, 'cause they're gonna throw pies at us. Beards told us. Ah! (whooping) -Good luck, guys. -Thanks. - Watch your step. -Ah! - Ah! -Hung, don't drop it, okay? Don't drop it. - I can't, I can't see. -Don't drop it. Don't drop it. - I can't see! Chee, I can't see! Just hold on to it tight, okay? -Oh, that's right in my ear. I can't hear. - Oh! Ah, ha-ha-ha. Okay, go straight down. -No. No! - Ah! Oh, don't drop the pie! It hit my face. Oh, my God, it hit my face! They hit my face. -This it? Oh, yeah. - Yes. No. Ooh, Double Roadblock. "Who wants to step right up?" This unique fairground collection is the largest in Europe, and dates back to the 19th century, bringing old carnival games to life. Teams must win all three games... ...to get a clue. I did the first Roadblock. You have to. Okay. "Get a ticket from the clown. "Three marked games. "When your ticket has been punched for all three, hand it over to the person at the shooting gallery." Hello. Wow. Look at this place. This is a weird one. Holy moly. What the hell is that? My gosh! -Ticket? - Ticket? You want a ticket? -Ah, thank you. - (laughs) -All right. - Hey, Maddison, you got this. -Hello. - Hello. -Welcome. Okay. - Thank you. You have to put three balls into the mouths in a row. I would finish this really fast. RILEY: Do your thing, Maddison. I'm two years older. I made him a better athlete. Come on, Maddison! He should have gotten the first try. MADDISON: Riley plays a lot of darts, and he's, like, 15 feet over my shoulder, like, leaning; I can just, like, feel him looking at me. No support. -(squeaking) - Ah! Come on! This is not a difficult challenge. Just drill it. Voom, voom, voom. MADDISON: Ah! Okay. I'm gonna move on to the next one. Yeah, switch. All right. Okay. Here we go. Three balls, ten cans. You have to destroy all of them. -You try. - Behind the line. Not too hard. Gently. Yes, yes. That's perfect. -Oh! - Again, again, again. Yes! You did it! Congratulations! -MADDISON: Yay! - RILEY: Finally. -MADDISON: Thank you. - That's beautiful. -This is for you. - Thank you. -Congratulations, sir. - Come on, Maddison. MADDISON: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Oh, we're starting. All right. -Okay, you are here. - I'm in, I'm in, I'm in. That's perfect. -All right. - We're gonna start a new game. Okay, the rules are very simple. You have a ball. Just make it roll here. And be the first one to finish by sinking the ball in the hole. So I just gotta get this small ball into these colored circles. Blue will make it go fast, red is the fastest, yellow is the least fast. Okay, so raise your arm like this with the ball. Trois. Deux. -C'est parti. Let's go. - (bell rings) Only one winner. Number two ahead. -Number two. - Two, two. -Here we go. - RILEY: Yes, Maddison! That's tough. 11 is the first one. This is gonna be embarrassing if we lose our lead because he can't win a few carnival games. MAN: You have to hurry up. And it's over. -Oh, my God. - 11. -Oh! - This is gnarly. -"Who has an eye for art?" - I got it. Meissonier... (groans) -Hey. - It's pretty hard. It's actually really hard. I've had a tough time so far. GARY: I walk into the painting area, and there's Aparna struggling. It was, like, a huge relief because I realized we weren't in last, and I can't wait to do this challenge 'cause I love art. So, like, I studied detail art, I've been to the Louvre, I've been to multiple different places in the world with art. I just, I have a bunch of art in my house. I just love that type of stuff. You don't really strike me as a Renaissance man. -Hey, I-I love artwork, though. - (laughing) -I love artwork. I just... - I've known you forever, Gary. And I've never known... Who are you? You're like six-six, like a caveman, -but you like art? - I do. Oh, my gosh. Beautiful. Champaigne? -Incorrect. - No. Okay. Sorry. Oh. We're definitely ahead of the blondes, though. Kaylynn, castle over there. -Thank God. - Finally. -I think that's our Speed Bump up there. - Damn it. Okay. "Prepare horse tack for the rider." Having arrived last in the previous leg, Kaylynn and Haley must now complete a Speed Bump by cleaning up the riding gear for two of the Château Chantilly's horses. "Down the stairs into the garden to find the horse and rider." (horse neighs) -Hi! - Hi! Oh, it's beautiful. -Oh, it stinks. - (neighs) I've never cleaned a saddle. KAYLYNN: Wash off any surplus dirt. Dirt and grease. I've never used any of these cleaning supplies. And there's also, like, something that stinks. -(neighs) - Looks to me like some horse poop... -or something in these. - Yeah. -(neighing) - What's going on? Probably pissed because it waited so long -for us in the cold. - I know. I'm sorry. And I'm really sorry. All right, we got to knock this out so fast. APARNA: Nothing seems to have the people that I'm looking for. He's gonna be somewhere. -Can you, can you come with me? - DeANGELO: Is this hard? I don't know, Michelle and Vic actually busted through it. Um, Victoria finished it so quickly, actually. Moroni? Giambattista. -You're correct. - Yes. Okay, Gary, I see you. We just got to get out of here, quickly. GARY: So we passed one team already. APARNA: Okay, I'm much more confident about this one. -Lancret? - Incorrect. Okay. (Aparna sighs, groans) I just want to be done with this challenge. ESWAR: She missed it again. There might be just some minor details that are off. Uh, I have no idea. Just looking through this view, it looks like it might be kind of a crowded room, so there might be, like, some minor details she's missing. APARNA: This is getting difficult. (groans) I think you're someone in the group. No, that's not it. None of them have a hat. So that's confusing. I don't see the people in the paintings! (groans) This one... or is it that one? Incorrect. APARNA: This is unbelievable. Too rich. Too complicated. Where did that soldier man go? Yellow lady. Aah! I'm done. Oh, this is really stressful right now. Knowing two teams have passed me. I don't want to let my brother down. I really think our family is, like, the epitome of what the American dream is. Our dad came here with, like, $20 in his pocket. -Incorrect. - Okay. Incorrect. -Incorrect. - No! I think the biggest values that our family instilled in us, uh, is definitely hard work and not really giving up. APARNA: Okay, Aparna. Everyone else has gotten it. You can get it, too. Bonheur. Bonheur. You are my guy and I need you. (clears throat) I think we have our man. Let's hope this is the right guy. Bonheur? -Correct. - Ah! -Okay, let's do it. - Okay. -Cool. Way to finish. - Just can't give up. God, there's a lot going into cleaning this. I think my saddle's looking pretty sexy. -All right. Want to do a check? - Yeah. Can we please have a check? Oh, my God. Okay. It's good? -Okay, let's go. Thank you! - Thank you! -Thank you! -(horse neighs) MAN: Oh, let's start the new race. RILEY: This should be right up our alley. I don't know if it's nerves, going first. We have a chance to win a leg and I think he's feeling that pressure right now. -(man speaking French) - (bell rings) Another chance to win. Damn. Roll it, roll the ball. Number five ahead. Number five, followed by number two. Number two is coming back. -MADDISON: Go in. - MAN: Yes! Looks like we could be doing okay here. Number two. And it's over. -That's good, that's perfect. - Yes! (whooping) -Oh, my gosh. - We won. -Good? - That's perfect. -All right. - Come on, Maddison. One more. -I can't watch this. - Let's go! Oh, I see, I see. When we play volleyball, what helps with serving is trying to find, like, that one speck of sand that you're gonna serve. So for my second attempt, my strategy was: just focusing on, like, a smaller portion of the hole. -Drill it. - Yes! -Yes, Maddison! - Yes, yes, yes! -Congratulations. - I got all three. -You got your tickets? - Yes. -Hit the bull's-eye? - Yeah. -(whooping) - Nice. "Race to Pont des Arts." There are dozens of beautiful bridges connecting Paris. This one is called Pont des Arts. It was commissioned by Napoleon, who was inspired by the modern metallic bridges that he'd seen in England. Today, it is the Pit Stop for this leg of the race. The last team to find me here may be eliminated. All right, let's do it, buddy. "Who wants to step right up?" -Oh, you have to do this one. - Good luck, guys. -Yeah, let's go win one, dude. - Taxi? LEO: Bonjour. -ALANA: Hustle, hustle. - Are you ready? -Okay. Yes. -ALANA: You can do it! - Hello. He played baseball in middle school, so I'm thinking he might be better at this than me. We'll see. ♪ ♪ (squeaks) ALANA: Focus, focus! LEO: The first challenge reminded me a lot of my days playing baseball, and I was not as good at throwing as I was at some other parts of baseball. You can do it! So close. LEO: I figured out something, Alana. -Nice. - See what I mean? Got to lean forward a little. We're still the only ones here, Leo. You got it. "Win three different carnival games." ALANA: You're so close. Nice. Ow! Yes, he did it. You did great. -(whooping) -Merci. DeANGELO: Chef Homeboy-ardee is in the building. -We got to make some pies. - APARNA: Come on. And whisk. -♪ La, la, la, la. ♪ - Make sure we spread it out -all the way around. - APARNA: You got to put force in, or otherwise it's not gonna thicken. -(vocalizing) -DeANGELO: There we go! There we go! GARY: They're killing me. My ears are bleeding. You can't sing. Hey, did you guys see the blondes? -Nah. - No clue where the blondes are. Nobody's seen 'em. KAYLYNN: Haley's got a good eye, so she can knock this out fast and we can move on to the next. We are definitely the last team here though. I hope she's not too stressed out. This is so funny. This guy's looking super extra. -Welcome to Paris. - Thank you. KEOGHAN: Riley and Maddison, I am pleased to tell you that you are team number... -one! - Yeah! -(both laughing) - As the winners of this leg of the race, you have won a trip for two from Travelocity and you are going to Vietnam. -Oh, sick. - (laughs) KEOGHAN: You're gonna spend five nights at the Phu Quoc Bay in the Turquoise Suite at the JW Marriott Emerald Bay Resort where you're gonna enjoy spa treatments at the Chanterelle Spa and dinner at the Pink Pearl restaurant. This is your first first place, right? -This is our first first. - Yeah. Which is exactly where we want to be. RILEY: To win a leg of this race means a lot because now we know we can do it. -We can hang with Chee-Hu. - Yeah. We can hang with Will and James. We can make it to the finals. And then we're gonna win. ALANA: You can do it, Leo! Come on, Chee! MAN: I'll punch the card if you win. -C'est parti. That's it. - (bell rings) That's very good. Number seven or number five. You want to win. And number two is coming back. Number two, also. Number two. And this is number two who won the race. You see the figure here. -Oh, my gosh. - You won the race. Oh, man. Chee, I've been here for a few races. MAN: First try and you won. -CHEE: Thank you so much. - HUNG: Come on, Chee! I think Chee may have just passed Leo. I, uh, honestly haven't played carnival games very much. That wasn't my thing as a kid. I was more just playing tennis and stuff like that. He's really good with eye-hand coordination. Any sort of ball game, he's really good at. -Yes! -(whooping) -Come on, Leo! MAN: New race, new chance. Hung and Chee are just made of magic and fairy dust. -Good job, Chee. - ALANA: I don't know. I'm just straight-up jealous. MAN: Five is leading the race now. Five, three, seven. Five or seven. Five or seven. -And this is number five. - (whoops) Yes. Yes! Looking good in those little tights! Ow! Do you know where Musée des Arts is? -Merci beaucoup. Let's go. - You're welcome. It's less than two kilometers away. JAMES: It's so cool in here. I can't handle it. -Number six! - This... is awesome. You're doing great, babe. MAN: Number five or number six, we're each tied. We're each tied. Number six ahead. Number six. -Winner. - JAMES: Yes! Nice job, babe! Yeah! Good work. -Let's go. You see the tent? - I see it back there. DeANGELO: Oh. Wait, hold up. -(whoops) - Oh. Oh. Oh. -Yes! - You guys are awful. You guys are awful. Careful. Ready? Eswar? Come on. -ESWAR: The delivery tent. - Open the door. Go. Entrée. -Ah! - Oh! (laughter) -Ah! Ah! - (laughing) -I could feel the pies starting to shake in my hands. - Yeah. But at the same time, I was, like, trying to lick the pie off of me. It was so good. Could I have another piece? Still time to catch up. Still time. So let's try him. Beige jacket, curly hair. White sleeve. That's him. Okay. Hi. Can you come with me? Please be it, please be it. Okay. You? École Française? -Correct. - (squeals) KAYLYNN: Great job! -Great job, Haley, great job. - Thank you. -Okay, so we got to get there fast, Haley. - I know. -Hung and Chee, had a little stumble there in Paraguay. - Yeah. But you've recovered fully. You're right at the top of the pack again. No time for lollygagging. JAMES: You're doing great, babe. MAN: Not too hard, but gently. WILL: Just those two? MAN: Yeah. (man shouts excitedly) Yes, babe! I want to play more! Uh, well, you're smiling, for obvious reasons. You're right up there at the top of the pack. -Tell us about the day. - Art and cooking and games? -And driving. And driving. Those are our favorite things. -The museum is next to the river? - Yes. -I didn't know that, Victoria. - Michelle, you saw it on his phone. MICHELLE: Oh, my gosh. Has everybody else been driving this long? I know we're heading north. So this is, like, where is the river? If Eswar and Aparna beat us here, I am going to have a panic attack. APARNA: You got this, Eswar, just take your time. Come on, Eswar. GARY: There you go, D. No, wait. Stop. That's perfect! Congratulations! -Thank you. - First try! -Yes. - I've never seen that before. APARNA: You got this, Eswar. Come on. You got it! -ESWAR: Oh, yes! - Oh, my God. -Good job. - Ah! Thank you. GARY: We haven't seen the blondes still anywhere yet? I have no idea where they are. -KAYLYNN: Faster, fast. -HALEY: I know, I know. -We haven't seen anybody in hours. - Really. It's, like, hard to be in the back of the pack, and... not know where everyone else is, and not know if there is a chance to catch up. I think that we just know that we have to, like, -keep... - Keep grinding. -And just... Yeah. - Which we're good at. Haley and I are used to being a team together. So Kaylynn and I spend every waking moment together. We live together, we work together, and we share a car. (laughing) -Oh! - (both laughing) That's why we're such a good team. -(laughing) - There we go. -Congratulations. - Thank you! Will and James, I'm sorry to tell you that we've had reports from the police department that they want to revoke your licenses because apparently you don't really know how to drive stick shifts. (laughs) Look, Victoria, what is this? -(stammering) - I'm looking. I don't... Please look at the stuff that's around us. -I'm not asking... - Michelle, what do you think I'm doing? Okay, just, like... Does anyone out here know where the district of Bercy is? -(horns honking) - District of Bercy? -(honking continues) - Bercy? -Anyone? - (engine revving) -(tires screech) - The Pavil... (laughs) GARY: Let's go, D. -Come on, Eswar. - (bell rings) (man exclaims) -GARY: Let's go, D. - DeANGELO: This is tough. APARNA: You got this, Eswar. Yellow for you. APARNA: Get it done. GARY: Come on, D. Let's get it, let's get it. DeANGELO: Yes! -Three. - Here we go. -MAN: Good job. -Merci. Come on. -Let's go. - Eswar! Hurry! -Number 11, number 11. - Come on! Come on! You got it! -Thank you. -Au revoir. Au revoir. MAN: 11 is winning! APARNA: Good job. Good job, Eswar. ESWAR: Yes! -Yes. - Yes! Finally. -Let's get out of here. - Let's go. HALEY: I'm so over being lost. -It's like it never ends. - It-it never ends. This is so stressful. This is so stressful. Oh, my God. Freaking out. (engine revving) -(tires screech) - (horns honking) (exhales) I'm, like, at my breaking point, Haley. HALEY: I know. Okay. We are only two kilometers away from it. We've been driving for hours. I'm so frustrated right now. -HALEY: We're gonna get there. - (horn honks) Do y'all know where Bercy is? Take a left here? He's saying take a left here. MICHELLE: Musée des Arts in Bercy? We're so lost. (mutters in French) VICTORIA: I think it's right here. -Okay. - Yes! -Thank you. - Thank you. DeAngelo and Gary, Eswar and Aparna, what's going through your mind now -on these legs? - It's like, every leg, you can't afford to make the mistakes you had made before. You make a mistake, it's over for you. HALEY: You know what, though, Kaylynn? Look, you see P. Bercy. -It says five minutes. - I know. And when we find it, it's the last time you have to drive this car again. Ever. So if you keep going down this road, it shall eventually lead us to... (chuckles) the museum. Okay, so we see a sign that says P. Bercy, two minutes. Look. This is... This looks like a museum. Look. Up here. All the stuff up here. ♪ ♪ -Wow. Yes! - Wow. -(giggling) - Welcome to the museum... Oh, yes, thank you! -Okay. - Oh, man. We're so happy we're finally here. We're pretty sure we're last, but... we're just happy we made it. -Nope. - It's just been a trip. We haven't seen a team since we pulled out of the airport. Oh! I just really hope we're not last. But that's the slimmest chance. MAN: Okay! (shouts in French) We were last last time. And we got lucky with the non-elimination. So, I mean, if we get saved again, that would be miraculous. -Oh! - Yeah! -Thank you! Thank you! - You did it! Like, we're in Paris, like... oh, this is the worst thing ever. Like, being lost in Paris for this whole entire time, but we never give up. -(both laughing) - Phil! Kaylynn and Haley, just one of those days when things didn't work out -exactly the way you wanted them to. - No. No. Not even close. It didn't work out even close to how we wanted to. Well, the thing about this race is that -it-it's full of surprises. - Yeah. -And I actually have a surprise for you. - Don't play with us. I'm not playing with you guys. You are not the last team to arrive. Shut up. No way. -You have not been eliminated. - No way. You have survived this leg. -(squealing) - And you will be racing in the next leg. Congratulations. -(both giggling) - You are team number seven. -BOTH: What? -KAYLYNN: It was, like, the most joyous moment of my entire life. Same. Same. I never thought somebody could screw up -worse than us. -We just, like, keep pulling rabbits out of our hat. -But at least we get to... - We get to... BOTH: Live for another leg. -Hi. Hi. Sorry I'm late. - (squeaking) Michelle, come on, you can do it. You can do it. You win that one. Whoa! Oh, I won! -Thank you. - Good job, Mich. Hey, you never know who's still in the game. VICTORIA: I feel defeated. (crying): I don't want to cry. All day today, she's like, "Don't give up. You can't give up 'cause you never know what's gonna happen." -Yes! Okay, thank you. - Yes! Au revoir. MICHELLE: Keep hoping. You never know. Michelle and Victoria... I'm very sorry to tell you that you are the last team to arrive. And unfortunately, you have been eliminated from the race. We're so thankful for... -Everything. - Everything. This is the closest that we've ever been in our lives. VICTORIA: Doing the race, it means a lot to me, too. And to do it with my sister, like, means the world to me. Like, 'cause we really are best friends now. -And... - Yeah. I'm telling you, we were not close before. At all before. And, like, we never even told each other we loved each other ever before. And then, like, now, like, when I say "love you," she's like, "I love you, too." -I love you. - I know. KEOGHAN: Next time on The Amazing Race... In Berlin, alliances start to crumble... DeANGELO: Oh, this is nice. ...as Will and James stall again. The clutch is out. So we can't go anywhere. And Hung falls apart. This is gonna... oh, God! (screaming)
