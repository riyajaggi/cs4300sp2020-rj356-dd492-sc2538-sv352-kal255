 this is amazing. Best day of my life. all right.  okey-dokey. where are we going? drive to balinberg. Once there make your way to Spimehall and wait further - Instructions. - Tiler and korey will be The first to leave Michaelskirche and drive to the Village of balenberg where Teams will find their first Clue.  go. we're starting this leg with Our second first place win. I think we have to take the Same car. we know we're leading the Pack today. So we're feeling good about leg Eight. there's that map in the Airport in the back. we don't get distracted by Drama between the other teams And whether an upcoming u-turn Board or people hating each Other. And it lets us focus every day We run the race. we're the perfect team. can you believe it? drive to ball ballanberg. to the cars. To the cars. follow each other?  we'll follow you. u-turn. goodbye.  we left the same time as Team fun and we like those Guys. And we are helping each other Out. Directions.  we're in it to win it but You get what you give. you help somebody in a key Situation and that's something They think about on the u-turn Map and that happens that's Great. We're not doing it for that Reason. That's just who we are.  colin and christie are a Good team to pair up with. they're great at navigating. Much better than us. So why don't we follow you?  am I droofing or you? so I held the record Officially today. For 32 legs of "The amazing Race." here we go. the most legs ever run on "The amazing race." I would like to thank phil. I would like to thank all the Fans who cheered us along the Way. and all of the racers that You beat out along the way. and interlachen to the Right, right? go straight.  straight? yeah. straight. no left.  are you sure? yes.  today is my leg. I have good feelings. And we have some sketchy legs The past few legs. chris, let's go to Ballenburg. last leg we had all kinds of Drama with victor and nicole. And the o'reilly sisters. And whether they were telling The truth or not telling the Truth. And who's possibly lying about It. all right. Let's go. leaving in last place does Not feel great. But I'm confident we can bounce Back from last place, and still Stay in this race. hopefully an equalizer. last leg a little bit of a Drama with the reilly sisters But no reason to bring it up Further because it will stress Us out and cause more drama That's not supposed to be There. we're here. My god.  here's the marked parking. to the marked entrance to The ballenburg gate. it opens up.  an equalizer. 7:00 a.M. We're the first ones here but It doesn't open until 7:00 a.M. kidding.  an omen. come here. Hi. hello.  hi. yeah. can't believe it. We made its way. leo is going to die.  leo, get the cat. Get the cat, get the cat.  kitty! My god. My god! and never seen him this Excited. this is ballan. -- ballenburg. come on. Let's go. we have some relationships To repair with the afghanimals. And we're hoping we can get to Them and repair this Relationship immediately before Anybody gets the u-turn. hey --  hi. hey.  can we talk to you? yeah. sure. so we just want to clear the Air because I think that they -- there was some confusion About nicole and victor saying That we said your names about Something with the u-turn. used to this being excluded. By the o'reillies. we should never talk to Nicole to begin with. and I don't have an Instagram followers. nicole came to us because we Made the big brother pact. and I didn't say one word And this was all rachel talking To nicole. I said you guys should watch Out because I heard that you Are in danger of getting urned. -- u-turned. clearly. It was too much to say. right.  but we would never do that To you guys. And we did have an alliance With the "Big brother" teams. Which is done. what happened?  literally done. I was kind of disappointed From what I heard, rachel. we were disappointed. we're over here calling you Guys our sisters. but agree --  we go back. With rachel and elissa I was Disappointed to hear that but She swore that she didn't say -- she's playing two sides of The story. Which didn't really rub the Right way off me. So, I mean, people make Mistakes. I just want to let you guys Know that personal friends, Like I -- I love you guys. and didn't rub me the right Way, either. But I'm not one to hold Grudges. we're going to prove to you Guys that we are trustworthy. rhett me give you an -- let Me give you an instance. You're in fifth and you have Rachel behind us and team Bromance who are you going to U-turn? rachel and elissa.  so it has changed a little. I messed up.  it's all good. It's all good. ok. too much drama. switzerland.  good to be switzerland. neutral.  good to be switzerland. In switzerland.  there was a cat here by the Way. come on. Let's go, let's go. let's go, let's go. Come on, jamal.  come on, rach. let's go. Go inside. what is going on here?  this is not good. seeing phil means that it's Got to be something crazy, Something that's going to shake Up the race. Ok. Good morning. good morning! Welcome to the ballenberg Community hole. Switzerland is a country where Everybody gets to vote. democracy.  yes. This is a country that believes It has the oldest democracy in The world. - wow. - So it seems only fitting That as we begin this next leg Of the race, we have a u-turn Vote.  is this out loud? Ness out loud.  what? This is in front of each Other. National captioning institute, Which is responsible for its Caption content and accuracy. Switzerland is a country Where everybody gets to vote. It seems only fitting we have a U-turn vote. - wow. - This is out loud. what? This is in front of each Other. Every team gets a vote. And we're going to vote until We determine the two teams that Have to complete both sides of The detour.  two teams. Yes. Two teams. first time in "The amazing Race" history, not only are you Voting for who to u-turn but Publicly announcing who you Just u-turned. Exactly. And nare right there next to You so they can see you. My goodness. We're about to vote live right Here. and we've all been expecting This u-turn. in "Survivor" that's what -- They had a travel counsel and Called it a live tribal. Think very carefully About this vote because there Are no more nonelimination legs Left in the race. I felt like people were Either going to vote Strategically for the strongest Team or against the team that They hated.  don't waste it on us. not since 2016 has there Been such a big vote. We did a random draw for The order in which you vote. oshese, my god. Rachel and elissa you get To vote and who you get to vote For. the whole drama going on We'll see where everyone stands With it. If they want to get us out. A speed bump and a u-turn. That's an easy way to just, you Know, adios. this is 1,000 percent game Related. Colin and christie. I'm so sorry. One vote, colin and Christie. Nicole and victor. Time for you to make a vote. what are you going to do? - what do you think? - Think very carefully About this vote. I don't know. I don't know what to do. just whatever --  so this is strictly a Strategy move. No emotions involved. Sorry, afghanimals. You guys are a strong team.  I literally -- what to do. and you said you don't know.  no. I --  what to do. we're the u-turn team. It's all good. Colin and christie, it's Your vote. you know, we'll just keep it Even. Rachel and elissa. Leo and jamal. colin and christie, we love You but we're going to u-turn - You guys. - We want teams that we can we want teams that we can - Beat. - Two votes for colin and Christie. Becca and floyd, it's your Vote.  I want more than anything to Win "The amazing race" and I Don't know if I can with colin And christie still in the game. So -- no hard feelings. colin and christie. that's when I knew, ok, Definitely we are one of the Teams. It was just a matter of who are We going to be doing this up Against? - And when do we get started? - Tyler and korey your Vote.  we love this team a lot. They got last on this last leg So we're just going to vote for Nicole and victor. - nicole and victor. - One vote left. Colin and christie, you have Three votes. Leo and jamal, colin and Victor, and rachel and elissa. You have one vote. So this is a big vote for you, Chris and bret. we're going to base our vote On who we're least close west And that's the reilly sisters. you guys are making us go Against colen and christie? Ok.  we formed tight Relationships with people. And I couldn't swing a vote for The others. I just couldn't. The after --  the afghanimals have been Friendly with us since day one And victor and nicole talking With us and I couldn't tell you Anything about the o'reillys But long -- orioles and have Long eyelashes and want to fix Them every five minutes. that's not smart. it's $1 million, guys. You aren't a strong team, Either.  it was -- I thought we were Racing for -- chris and bret Can't outrun they team and Clearly not more intelligent Than the other teams. right. So I would make a decision Based on you who think you have A better chance at beating for $1 million.  that was $1 million, guys. The vote is done. We have two teams that have Been u-turned. Colen and christie and rachel And elissa, is everybody ready To race? Good luck. Travel safe. Go!  go, go. here we go. let's go. you got it. just grab one, bret.  and hay -- This detour requires Teams to make hay while the sun Shines. Something swiss farmers do Every summer to ensure that Their animals can survive the Long, cold winters. Using an old style sythe like Sardinha a swiss under 16 Champion, one team member must Cut a lane of grass while the Other rakes up behind them. When the grass has been Properly stacked, they will be Rewarded with a clue. Every year, more than 350,000 Cows come down from the Mountains to escape the cold Winter months. And are celebrated at festivals Like this. This detour requires teams to Dress them up and then lead Them to the party to be judged.  hay making. hay making. cut grass.  we're going to do hay Making.  hay making or cow cow Dressing.  we should have u-turned Victor and nicole. especially since they had a Speed bump. speed bump. Having arrived last in The previous leg, nicole and Victor must take down and fold The 26 flags representing the 26 states of switzer lnled. Then try to catch up with the Other teams. 26 legs right in here, nick. holy crap. We have 26? You want to get them down? yep.  my gosh, I can't believe you Did that. That was bold. he thought people were going To vote for stronger teams. And nicole had said the O'reilly sisters. Followed up by I don't know. I said vote for rachel and Elissa. and you said you don't know After that. you know you made a bad Move. I won't respond if you argue With me. I'll tell you that right now.  which one is this? cow dressing. choose the basket. Got it. Provide materials to make Headdresses. finish example. For a reference, right here. let's do it.  make your headdress. do you want to take one seed And I'll take the other? perfect.  chris and bret picked us to Go against colin and christie. So we have to do two detours.  these guys aren't my Friends. but I don't plan on getting Eliminated. lay off the garland. You're just looking at this and Trying to replicate it.  I think colin and christie Like us. Right, guys? we like you guys. we love you.  we like you guys. we like you guys, too. We wouldn't wouldn't have U-turned you guys if it were Not a nonoption. I understand that people are Doing what they've got to do to Stay in the race. And if they feel like that is Taking us out, I can respect That. But obviously we got to do what We got to do because we want to Stay in this race. We're in it to win it. you got this, rach. here we go. it's not like you to not Want to put a headdress on a Cow. thank you for not u-turning Us. We knew everybody us else but Them. we voted with our heart and Maybe not with our head. it could bite us but I feel Right now pretty good about the Vote.  this is it. This is it.  the other ranks may switch At any time. and the -- be at the end of Your lane. hay with them. Hand-held cutting tool. Rake it. Stack it. That's us. this is the right choice, Ty. back at the office here.  good job, leo. You're cutting it. You're shaving it. Good job.  you can't rake until I get ok. beautiful day in Switzerland. Trying to work away the Emotional u-turn. That sucked. becca is crushing that. becca has got this and a Farm girl. Start raking, girl.  old mcbecca had a farm. E-I, e-I, o! this will take some time. I'm -- the way I saw it, They already hate us. So why make another team hate Us? You know what I mean?  you're right. I would say that's our Biggest communication error and It happened at the craziest Time. fold in half twice. and half one more time. we bounce back. We're a real couple. We can get stressed and we can Get tense but at the end of the Race all that is by the Wayside. We love each other. That's just what we had to do To get to where we are now.  good thing we didn't get U-turned plus the speed bump.  what you did do with all the Pens?  they're -- you have to be very careful.  rach, we got this. we're fighting against Nicole and victor because they Had a speed bump. But our -- our really big Competition is colin and Christie because we're double Urnlted with them. rachel, you're so good at This stuff. we have to duplicate the Flour arrangement. it looks amazing. ok.

Having her life. and on that farm I had a s Ythe, e-I, e-I-o. and I'm I'm sweating and Divis gusting -- I wouldn't be Surprised if she's like spent a Summer doing hay making. landscaping.
