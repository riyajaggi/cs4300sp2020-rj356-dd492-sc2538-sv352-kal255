 Previously on The Amazing Race... 11 teams began a race around the world. - Go! - - Let's go, let's go. - Come on, Haley. "...fly to the island of Trinidad." In Trinidad, teams partied at Carnival... ...but once on the neighboring island of Tobago, they were all business. So we need to memorize the colors. Former Olympians Kellie and LaVonne - stumbled early. - I hate losing

 more than I love winning. At a musical Roadblock, former NFL player Gary - hit a low note... - ...while Cajun sensation Michelle was perfectly in tune. Thank you. In the end, married parents Hung and Chee won the leg. And best friends Nathan and Cody came up short. You have both been eliminated from the race. After completing the first leg, teams were surprised to find out they were still racing, and had to catch a flight to Colombia. - Let's go. - Another taxi, another airport. We're exhausted,

 but the other teams are, too, so we'll just keep on racing and hopefully we can keep up the good results. The past ten years, life has been really, really crazy with work and kid and then kid and then kid. We don't really have much time for each other, so this is a huge break from reality for us to reinvest in us. I'm hyped to get to Colombia, man. We're in ninth place, but we're still running, we're still in the race. Everybody was kind of gunning for us because of the fact that they knew that we were Olympians. So being weak on the first leg may make people - start to underestimate us. - Sleep. We're gonna show everybody why we're Olympians... a little brains, a lot of speed... And just use that to our advantage to win. Bogotá, Colombia. - Yes. - We finished in tenth. - Right. - Not what we wanted. But it's easy to overcome for us. We overcame adversity multiple times playing football, and we'll overcome it again. But I know this... We came here to win this competition. Our future's so bright, Gar, put on my glasses. Thank you so much. Got to get on this one flight that we all share. We're all tied for first right now. I'm going to just pass out. My father played the biggest role, probably, in my life. He's taught me so much and he's raised me to the man I am today. This race will give us the opportunity to do things together that we would have never done together. He's relied heavily on me his entire life. But right now, I know that I'm gonna have to rely heavily on Frank. Two tickets for Bogotá, please. - On the double. - All teams will fly 1,400 miles southwest to Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia. Built more than a mile high in the sky, the thin air here could push some teams to the breaking point. Heads up, let's have a nap. - All right, let's go. - Thank you so much. Have a good night. This is so cool! - All right. - We're at the airport. - Colombia! - Let's do it. We are here to kick ass, and don't give a damn about your name. Colombia! - - Go, go, go. - Let's go! Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Right behind you, D. Vámonos. Grab it. "Travel by taxi to Mina de Sal." Teams must travel by taxi to the Nemocón Salt Mine, home to the world's largest deposits of rock salt like this in the world. Once here, they must search these underground tunnels which cover an area of more than two acres, for a ten- or 20-minute hourglass, then sign up for a departure time in the morning. Their hourglass will give teams the power to stop another team racing for ten or 20 minutes when they encounter a Yield during the race. The power of the Yield can be used to stop a team in their tracks... Oh, my God. - They yielded us, Colin. - Damn it. ...dramatically affecting the outcome of the race. Knowing that every second counts, will teams make this game-changing decision? Taxi. Get in, D. You get us there first, you get more money. "Your hourglass will give you the power to make..." - "another team..." - "...another team yield at certain points - in the race." - Oh, my God, so we want a 20. Oh, my gosh. This to... this-this could add a whole different element. It's going to, like, put a lot of strain on these, like, relationships and kind of start, like, the alliances earlier on in the race. Everyone's gonna have the power to yield. Everyone's gonna get that opportunity. We obviously want to find the one that's 20 minutes. Absolutely. - Okay. - Thank you. Gracias. All right. Okay. Where do we need to go right now? Straight. - Come on. - All right, ready, Hung? - Yeah. Oh, this is cool. I've never been in any, like, spooky caves. Oh, there's a dog here. - Hey, dog. - Hi, baby. Can you tell us where an hourglass is? Okay. Hourglass. Fast as we can. - Sounds like another team. - Hey. - You guys find anything? - Not yet. -Nope. - Chee, here's the board. - We can't sign up yet, right? - No. - We have to find the hourglass first. There's five 6:00 a.m.s and five 6:30s. There are some Yields that were ten minutes and some Yields that were 20 minutes. But there was a trade-off. The more time you searched for a 20-minute Yield, the bigger risk you had of not signing up for the first release time the next morning. First one we get, we grab. We made the strategic decision to grab the first hourglass we could so that we could sign up for the first release time. Come on. - How much? - 250. - 50? Let's go. - Where is it? This way? - Yeah. The 20-minute thing - is worth risking. - Yeah. Do you see it? - Just keep looking out for one. - Go, go, go. I think we need to go the other way. There's a ten-minute right here. It's ten-minute, though. Leave it. D-Do you see it? I found a ten-minute hourglass, Hung. Let's go. Let's go. There it is. Eswar. See, they just go one. Ugh, he leaped for it. We could've gotten it first. Babe, go. Where the hell is it? - Oh. 20-minute, Gar. - Let's get it. Let's go. - Let's go. - Oh, we're 100% using this. Right there, right there on the ground. There it is, there it is. Go, go, go. - Nice, nice, nice. - Yes. We're team number one. - Oh, my God, got to catch my breath. - You guys found one. All right. 6:00 a.m. Third team. - Right here. Perfect. - Oh, we made the 6:00 a.m. - That's good. - There's only one left. - Which way? Okay, come on. - Go, go, go. Ten. I got it. - You got it? Great. Let's go. - Let's go. - Hourglass. Go, get it. - Where... I don't see it. Uh, ten. Let's go. - Grab it, grab it, grab it. - All right, let's go. Come on, let's grab it. Yes, we're the last one. We luckily made the right decision to just take the first hourglass we could find, 'cause we were the last team to get on the 6:00 a.m. crew. Damn it, we're all on the second one. So, a deficit again. I think that we'll be able to catch up, but so far, eh, mediocre pace. - We're here. Got one. - Oh, my God. Yes. 20. - - We got a 20-minute hourglass. - Thank you. Thank you, God. Thank you. - Got it. All 20 of us are packed in to a little mine bunker, and we're all getting bed... Ready for bed. Cave was, for me, it was pretty rough. We were last. We kind of did ourselves an injustice, but we found a ten-minute hourglass. Buenas noches. Buenas noches. Wake the neighbors. And we're off. - Let's go. - Let's do this. - Come on, come on. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Come on... you got it? Run. Go. - It's steep. - Oh, God. Almost there. Oh, my lantis. "Travel on foot to Templo Parroquial San Francisco de Asís." Teams must now race on foot to Templo Parroquial San Francisco de Asís. Once here, they must climb the bell tower and search for a piece of pre-Columbian art or an emerald. In the 19th century, Colombia was the world's largest supplier of gold. And today, it produces more emeralds than any other country on Earth. Then teams will battle heavy traffic as they make their way back into downtown Bogotá to Plazoleta del Rosario. Teams with an emerald must deliver their treasure to an emerald street broker. While teams with a golden raft must deliver their item to an archaeology professor to get their next clue. "Travel on foot." Let's go. - Guys, do you want to help each other? - Yeah. - Yeah, let's help each other. - All right, let's do it. - Perfect. - Let's maintain the lead. We knew going into this leg, we wanted to work with the five teams that were departed early from the mine. Let's find this place together. Here. These look like bell towers. Yeah. Go. Good job, guys. This way. Stairs. We go up to the bell tower. Come on. The teams with the 6:00 a.m. departure said, "Hey, we're gonna help each other," we made alliance with them. What do we think, green or gold? No, they're right there. They're both up here. Just grab one, just grab one. - The entire... - Go ahead, guys. Eswar. So just pick one. - Hurry up. - Will, calm down. - Okay, let's do it. - Taxi. Hurry up. - Let's grab a taxi, okay? - Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, come on. Taxi! - Get a taxi. - Where's... there's taxis over here. - Taxi! - Right here. We were the first to get this treasure. - Pretty rad. - So it's a golden, uh... - Golden raft. - ...raft. We're going to Bogotá where we have to find a white-bearded man. - So basically, we have to find our dad. - Yeah. The item we grabbed from the tower was a... emerald. Look at that baby right there. Now we're in traffic. Uh, no bueno. The traffic coming from Nemocón to Bogotá was a nightmare, and being from L.A., we should've been kind of comfortable with it, but when you're racing against other teams, it makes you a little bit kind of paranoid. - Okay, we're here. - Yeah. You okay? - Found it. - Okay. - Haley. - Go on. - You got it, Frankie? - Yes. Let's go. Let's go. - Marked taxis. Okay. - There they are. Is this the freeway? In theory? So in theory, this is the freeway? There's a building up ahead. I wonder if that's the university. "Universidad del Rosario." - Right here. - Yeah. Park, park, park. - Espera aquí. - Yes. Hung, Chee "returno." - All right, let's go. - I think it's up there, Chee, the, the plaza? We're looking for, like, vendors or something, right? - Uh, r... e-emerald broker. - Okay. Emerald broker... I don't see any emerald brokers here. Okay, okay. Just hold on... All right, now we got to find Plazo Rosario. Okay. Going to the archivo histórico. - Keep your eyes open. - Brothers are here. Beard brothers are here. Okay. Where are they? - By that building. - Okay. Do you guys have emerald or a-a raft? We have a raft. - Oh, we have an emerald. - Let's go back. I don't see any emerald brokers. Let's go. "Archivo histórico." This is it, right here. Buenos días, señor. ¿Cómo está? Para ti. - This is not real. - Oh, my gosh. - It's over. It's over. - We just came two hours from the mountains. - But here is your clue. - Oh, my... I almost grabbed his beard and just ripped it. Ready? Teams must travel by taxi to Escuela Nacional Circo Para Todos and search for their next clue. This is the first opportunity for teams to stop another team from racing if they use their hourglasses. - Okay, let's go back to our taxi. Let's go, let's go. - Okay. Maybe the people in suits over here? - Uh... - Chee, let's do these people. - Clue, por favor? - Clue, por favor? Yeah... Oh, oh, oh. Oh. - Okay, gracias. - Gracias. - Let's go back to, uh, Omar. - Let's go back. Yeah. All right, let's go. - Right here, right here, Gar. - Yeah, right here. Hey. You guys need an emerald? - Here you go. - Clue? Ah. Perfect. Thank you. - "Parqueadero." - Riley, wh-where you going? - Left. Mario! - No, no, no. We're good, we're good. Riley, he didn't park here. Omar, Omar, Escuela Nacional... - Said we'd come back here. - He's not here. - Mario! - Mario's not here. We're gonna have to go back. We need him to wait somewhere. - All right, come on. Taxi? - We got to go. Go, go, go. Where's our guy? - This way, this way, this way. Come on. - Okay, let's roll. - That could be him right there. Looks like his car. - Where? Right there. Is that him? Look, there's the beard guys. They're right there, Eswar. - Do you see them? - This is another group. Plazoleta Rosario? No, it's not him. That's another team. Up there and then go left. And you parked there and then went to the... Yeah, the university's over there to the right. The beards just told us that we're on the right track. So, so far this pact of us five teams in the front, working together, is in place. Is that him? - Mario? - There he is. - Hey! - Yes, yes, yes, yes! Yeah, baby! - Mario! So, do you know where the plaza is? It's up. Can we turn around? - Think we're lost. - Yep. - So after leaving late... - We're now lost. We've missed, like, a million turns. I don't think he really knows where he's going. You know, taxi drivers are kind of the luck of the draw, but this was definitely a curveball that we did not see coming. - Phone's dying. - Ooh, um... Um, does he have a power cord? I feel like I'm gonna throw up. - So he has no power cord. - No. Oh, my God. Okay. Let me see, what street are we on? We are the navigation of a place that we've never been. I think we should be 5 and something. Okay, 5 and 7. Is that...? Eswar, wait. Go. Yes, yes. Look, they found it. They weren't there. Do you have a clue for us? Yeah. All right, right. Right, right. - Right here, right here. - Right, right, right. - Turn around. - Right here. - Wait for... here. - Wait. Let's go. Yeah, "Circa Todos." Let's go through that. There's a box right there. Yield. Oh. We choose not to yield anybody. We did choose not to yield anybody, because we wanted somebody in the back five to yield somebody there and waste theirs, and have a little drama between them. We choose not to yield anybody. Roadblock. "Who feels like clowning around?" This is Circo Para Todos, a circus school dedicated to promoting a culture of nonviolence and peace, where young people learn extraordinary skills like this. This Roadblock requires teams to join them by attempting the Wheel of Death, and then walking on a tightrope high above the ground with a tray of fragile glasses. - I'll take this one, Gary. - All right, go ahead. - "Who feels like clowning around?" Hung. - You do. Oh, this is real. This is really happening. Gary, you owe me big time. 'Cause red lipstick is not my color. - Okay, you're ready. - We're ready? Okay. Oh, yeah. Ooh. - See what we got. - Live band. I can't do that. Whoa. Whoa... Whoa. Oh, my God. Whoa. - Oh, there he is. - There he is. Look at him go. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Look at his outfit. - I know, right? - Looks good with the tiny hat. - Yeah. - All right, here goes Hung. - Ah... Let's go, Hung. Climb up? So I'm, like, disoriented a little bit from the Death Wheel, then it's like, "Okay, now it's time for you to walk across this tightrope," I'm like, "What?" Like this? - Gonna be interesting. - Holy cow. This is gonna be, this is gonna be hard. Oh, my gosh, he's got to hold - the wine bottle. - Oh, man. Slow and steady wins the race. Oh, look at that, he's, like, shivering. Let's go, Hung. Come on, D. You're more than halfway there. Oh, my goodness, he is shaking so much. - Oh. Come on, D. - Oh, my gosh. - Almost there. - Oh, my God. - Yes! - And so I get across and I'm like, "Yeah. Beasted it. Where's my clue?" And they was like, "Nope. You got two glasses," and I'm like, "I hate you now. I really do." Now he's got to go back. No! Oh, my goodness. Come on, Hung. Come on, Hung. My one thought was "I have to do this in one try." So, slow and steady. White-bearded man. - Bonjour. - We have something for you. - Thank you. My heart. - Oh, gracias. Emerald? Emerald? - Does anyone want this? - Leo! - Yes. Give it, give it. Great. Ready? - Yes. Thank you. Go to the, go to the next clue, Rile, it's up there. We declare we're not gonna yield anyone. "Who feels like clowning around?" - I'll do it. - All right, you got it. - Yeah, I'll do it. - Let's do it. Slow and steady. Don't worry about DeAngelo. Don't fall. He got it! - Wow. That's very good. He did really good. I think he's done. - Hold on. - Here. You open it. Y-You did the challenge. - We got Route Info. - Route Info. All right. "Travel by taxi to Carrera 26 to B... to Bog..." Uh... "Number 10-03, Bogotá, and search for your next clue." - Yes. Come on. - All right, let's go. Let's go. Tightrope. - Great. "Who feels like clowning around?" - You do. - Do it. - Do it. - They just said "tightrope," Will. - Do it. Do it. - Think about it. Think about it. You are a dancer. - Do-do... think about it. Okay. - I'll do it. Will has balance, he's coordinated. That's why I was so persistent about Will doing the Roadblock. I can't do all of them, though. Stop being weak. - "Who feels like clowning around?" Me. - "Clowning around." Okay. Oh, my gosh. Oh, I think she's there. I think she's there. She's there. She's there. Yeah! - Congratulations. - Ah. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. - Let's go. Let's go find Omar. - You're ready to go? I'm ready when you are. There it is, right there. - Yeah, this has to be it. - Cool, cool, cool. Thank you, sir. ¿Dónde está el Universidad del Rosario? Okay. This way? He said this way and around. Look. Look, look, look. - The Olympians are here. - Oh, my God. - Did y'all just get here? - Where is it? - We don't know. We just got here, too. - Okay. - Great. - Okay, so they haven't found it yet. Look, in here? This is it. This way. We'll have to go that way. - This is where we need to be. - Are you sure? We got to go inside. It's got to be this. Here is your clue. Thank you so much. - Hi. This is for you. - We have a present for you. - Yay. Gracias, gracias. - Thank you so much. - Gracias. - Muchas gracias. You got this, Rile. When we came into this, we decided Maddison's gonna do the heights stuff, I was gonna do the small, intricate puzzle stuff. This one ended up being a heights thing, so immediately I was like... "Bummer." I was so scared. That a way, Riley! - - Yes! Good job. Yes, Riley! Muchas gracias, amigo. Yeah! I knew you had this! You got this, Aparna! Come on, let's go. This is it, this is it. I like your makeup, by the way. Really... Is it b... I... - It's awesome. - Is it bad, bro? - - I can't even see it, bro. It's right there. Wait. Colombians just love to trick out their rides. And now teams will give it a go when they try to attach all these decorations onto one of these trucks. But there's one item that they're all certainly going to miss. - -Attaching the horn to the front of their truck. When the bogotano customizer is happy with their work, he'll hand them a clue. So we got to find the materials. - Oh, right here. - Okay. Find the license plate. Tell me what the license plate is. - This one? Okay. - Grab the green one. Yeah. - Yeah. - Z-I-E-8-4-5. - We got to find that first. - We got to find that one? Yeah. We're right here. Z-I-E-845. All right, let's go look at this thing first. Yeah. Come on. So this is what it's supposed to look like. So they got the tassels in this... oh, it is decked out. Everything had to be identical to what the finished example was. It had to be a certain way. We know we're definitely gonna pay attention to detail. - Do that side. - All right. - So we're going through here. - Yep. - I saw some materials over here. - Yeah. - Oh, here, here, here. Yes. - Okay, um... - Just yellow? Okay. - Sure. - The tassel goes towards us, right? - Yes. We got to make this look good. Just two more steps, two more steps. Yes! Let's go! "Who feels like clowning around?" - I'll do it. - Okay. Let's go. - Like this or on the roof... on this right here? - Yeah. - Right there. It goes like that. - Okay. Right now we're battling for first. We think we got the inside, for the most part, done. Now we're working on the outside. We got to figure out where two other things - go inside, but... - Yes. License plate and then hook up the horns. You do that, Gary. - I can hook these up. - Go ahead. Red. There's a set of materials marked with a license plate. Okay, let's go here. So we need to decorate this truck to match exactly this truck. - Okay. - Yes, arts and crafts. James, okay, we have to choose one. Let's do the orange one. Oh, wow. This is... This is a little bit tougher than I thought it was gonna be. You hold that part, I'm gonna do this side first, okay? - Okay. And there's two... - It's, it's my other hand. Okay. There's two more nuts on the ground. I've been consistently insecure about my size, in terms of being... Not being able to reach things. But I could just stand upright behind the wheel and just screw it in with my hands, and that was really fast. - So it worked to our advantage. - It worked to our advantage. - This goes up here, Maddison. - Okay. We're gonna put on the seats after that, too. - This is Claudia. - Claudia. She likes to dance, she really loves merengue. The queens have come to give Claudia a makeover. - Okay, Hung, I'm done. - Okay, let's go ask for a check. Judge? Hola. Uh, judge? Okay, hold on, let me... I'm gonna, uh, let me get tape. I want to straighten up the tassels. Chee, is this not long enough? The driver's got a cable back now. He's got a phone, um, so we can navigate now without having to guess. I honestly think everyone's there. - I do, too. - I think we're last. I just feel it. We might need to use our hourglass and make a Yield. If-if that's even an option, though. - "Who feels like clowning around?" I do. - Alana does. - Take it, Frankie. - Want me to do it? - Yes. - I'll do it. Oh, my God. - Thank you. - Congratulations. Merci. Thank you. Go, Alana! Oh, my God, oh, my God. Am I done? I did it? You got it, Alana! I'm a little scared of heights. Oh, my gosh. Great job, Frankie! Go, Alana! I love you! I might vomit. My brain can only focus on not freaking out for so long. And I was just like, "No, I need to get out of here, I need to do this." You got this! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Don't worry about it! You'll do it again. Come on, Frank-man! Take your time, baby. - You got it. There. Ready? - Okay. You got it, Alana! Great job, Frank. I'm sorry, Leo. I don't know what's going on. Just take your time. Yes, Frank-man! - Congratulations. - Thank you, sir. Thank you so much. You got it, Alana! Oh, there's a Yield. Haley? Should we do it? I don't know what to do. We choose not to yield. - We choose not to yield. - Haley and I choose not to yield. - Oh, my God, we're second to last. - Oh... - "Who feels like clowning around?" - I do. - Haley's clowning around. - Okay. There was one clue left and we have one team behind us. We should've used the hourglass on them. That was a mistake. We're in the general vicinity of where we need to be. We're just not, like, 100% where we need to be. Oh. Sí, sí, sí. Go, go. - Sí. "Who here feels like clowning around?" - It's yours. - Okay, cool. - - There you go. - Yay! - Thank you so much. - Okay. - Here we are. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. They are part of the second departure from the mine this morning, so that means they're starting to catch up, so the pressure is on. - Wait, that's our fender. - Yeah, we're gonna come back... - Hi, ladies. - Hi, y'all. - Hi. - I love cars. I am in automotive sales. When I saw trucks and I saw parts and toolboxes... - She's like, "Yeah." - I was like, "We got this." You don't want to undo these bolts and nuts completely 'cause you want to put it on and just roll these in with our fingers. Come on. Watch, I'll show you. Do you want to reread the clue? And we're just kind of guessing right now, so, latest theory is that our screws weren't, you know, flush with the, with the car here, weren't screwed in all the way. Chee. - Yes. - Come with me over here. Please. - Okay, I'm coming. I don't think it was that, Chee, I think it's something about hooking up its horn for one of the locals. Where is the horn part? Oh, okay. "Hook up its horn for one of the locals." It's not hooked up here. Oh. Nice, Hung. I'm almost done with this. Come down. All right. Judge, check. - Judge, check, please. - Check. Thank you. - Oh, my God, yes. Gracias. - Thank you so much. Gracias. Gracias. Thank you so much. Okay. This is Parque Nacional. Founded in 1934, it is one of the oldest parks in Bogotá, and covers an area of more than 700 acres. The last team to find me here at the Pit Stop may be eliminated. - Omar. Omar, Omar! - Omar, okay. Hi, Omar. Muchas gracias, Omar. We saw Hung and Chee leave before us, and they arrived after us. So that was a little disheartening. - Thank you very much. - Thank you very much. All right. Come here. "The last team to check in may be eliminated." - Let's go. - Ooh. Let's go. Do you know where we're going? - It's not over. - It's not over. Come on, Haley! We were in full panic mode. We are second to the last team. - We knew that she had one try to do it. - Yeah. Yeah, Haley! - Thank you. - Yeah, let's go! Even though I was, like, super unsteady, I might've fell off the thing before I let the plate fall. - -It was like, it's like if you have a drink, and you're falling down, you're like, "Don't let my drink fall." You know. So... - All right, let's go. - Come on. Mucho gracias. Mucho gracias. Yeah. Ciao. Right here. Right here is fine. - Come on. - Okay, come on. Where is it? Oh... - Oh! - Wow. Welcome to Bogotá. - Thank you. It's wonderful. - Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Hung and Chee, I am pleased to tell you you are team number one. Man, that feels good. Feels great. And I have some great news for you. You have won a trip for two from Travelocity, and you are going to Switzerland. You are going to spend five nights in an Alpine village at the Wengen Classic Hotels, take a trip on the Jungfraujoch train to the highest station in Europe, get breathtaking views of tandem paragliding, and enjoy a Swiss dinner for two. - That sounds amazing. I love you so much. - Love you. Second win in a row, I think it just shows that we communicate well together and we're trying to support each other and having good teamwork. - I think that's the key. - Yeah. - Oh... - Right? - There's Phil. - Why does he have a jacket on? - It's not even cold. - I know. I'm not running like you guys. That's why. You know what I mean? Check this guy out. - That's it. - Oh. - Wow. -I could do that. - That's awesome. Wow. DeAngelo and Gary, I am pleased to tell you - that you are team number two. - That's... Not one, but we're still going. - Better than tenth. Better than tenth. - Cost us, man. Good. Good? Check? No? Yeah. Judge? Hola. You like? You like? No? What is it? - There we are, fitting in right here, boy. - Perfect. - The one in the middle's what it has to look like. - Yeah. Let's start with the front. - There are some volquetas. - Yeah. Okay. Let's go back this way. Caliente. This is LSU colors right here. Louisiana. Purple and gold. Vic, we got this, Vic. We got it, let's go. Think that's right. We'll see. This goes outside. That end over there. Okay. Another check, please? No good? Do you have the Route Info? - The clue? - It's in my bag. - It is? - Worry about this. - It's in my bag. - Well, I want to read it. Like, how detailed does this need to be? It's not gonna be in there. I need to fix these t... What? What? "Customize a volqueta and then hook up its horn for one of the locals." I'm sorry, dude. - I'm sorry, man. - It's all good. Whatever. We're fine. You're, like, freaking out right now, and it's... we... Let's look at the horn. - Riley, the horn's down here. - Okay. These are... Riley, I got it, Riley. - Okay. - Riley, come down here. Right here, right here. Okay, so that's fine. Actually, can you just fix this end, 'cause it's farther down here, and then I'll do... It is perfect. - Vic, how you doing, girl? - Good. Oh... Sí, señor, sí, señor, sí, sí, sí. Thank you very much. All right. Hey. Muchas gracias, amigo. Muchas gracias, señor. I don't understand. Come on, brain. Yes! Yes! Yes! - Yes! - On the first try. - - Thank you so much. - Let's go! - Yeah! Thank you. Gracias. Thank you. How the... did they pass us? I literally don't get what is wrong. We have identical borders just like the other two trucks. This is ridic... This is really ridiculous. Oh, my God. This is ridic... this is really ridiculous. I'm gonna be livid if it's those flaps. This one looks low for some reason, baby. Come on. Come on, baby, we got this. - Let's go fast. - I really think this is it. "Choose a set of materials marked with a license plate." Okay, we need to get this done fast, dude. Ladies, your gear's over there. - Okay. - Everybody's in the same spot. There were still four or five teams there, so we were like, "Okay, we're still in it." The pressure's on. Isn't it nice? Muy bueno. Sexy. - No? - Not right. - No está bien. Okay. - Okay. Thank you, thank you. Okay, theirs is aligned. Come here. We have to hook up the horn. - Oh, my God, what? - We have to hook up the horn. There's one detail that we missed, - and that is reading the clue. - Rookie mistake. - These are not attached. - No. We have to hook up the damn horn. They're doing something. Oh, my God. That's what it is. - Alana. - Leo, we have to hook up the horns. - Where's the horn? - They're right here. This is great. I'm glad they said that so loudly. It would have taken me a while to figure that out, and I'm embarrassed, but that's how it goes. - Check? Judge. - Check. We're next. Honk our horn, honk our horn. We're gonna put our packs on. We're feeling good about this. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Give me a kiss, give me a... I'm so annoyed with ourselves. - Thank you, thank you. - Give me a hug. - Give me a hug. - Do we have all the clues? Let's go! - See? - - I saw that look. - He's like, "You idiots figured it out." Please say yes. - No? - No está bien. Okay. I don't know what it could be. There's Phil! Phil. Riley and Maddison. - Yeah? - I'm very pleased to tell you you're team number three. - Yes! - That's pretty good. - Give me three. - Right? One, two, three. Aparna, run. Ah. Eswar and Aparna, I am pleased to tell you that you are team number... - Four? Four? - ...four. - - Yes! - We have another team coming in. - Oh, my gosh. Oh, my God. Michelle and Victoria, I am pleased to tell you that you are team number five. - Congratulations. - - What? - Yes! Check, please. We'll take another check. No, no, no está bien, no está bien. - Okay. Gracias. - Thank you. All right, we're still not... Still don't have it. We have no clue. No clue. - Oh, my God. - We're on an equal playing field again, but the frustrating part is, we have no idea what's wrong. - No está bien. No está bien. - Oh, damn it. Okay. We were all super frustrated. Everyone was about to be in tears. I think that we need to start picking it apart and doing it all over from the inside. - No está bien. - Mm. 'Cause it's probably right in front of our eyes. Open 'em, baby. Will and James, you are team number six. We have watched every season of The Amazing Race, and I can't believe that, of all people, - Will and James forgot to read the stinking clue. - Their clue. And that's what put us in the back of the pack. The judge continues to say no. Our truck is supposed to mirror the demo truck. Are there supposed to be flags somewhere where we haven't put in flags? Yeah, were there flags on the top back? We need flags in the back. Let's go. - Damn it. - Yeah. They forgot the whole back part of their truck. Our whole truck is done. - Good? Good? - All right, that's fine. - Hold on. - Check, please? He's gonna honk the horn. Yes. - Thank you so much. - Muchas gracias. - Sorry for wasting all your time. - Bar, bar, food, sustenance. - Is your horn hooked up? - Is our horn...? -What? - Hook up the horn. - Oh, my God. - Thank you, thank you... - Thank you so much. We helped Kaylynn and Haley because I like having them around. - They're nice and fun. - And if we had left, we were just leaving them to chance, and we didn't want them to be eliminated. - LaVonne! Come here. - Okay, I'm coming. I saw Leo and Alana run over and I watched their mouth. It's the horn. You have to hook it up. Y... We got fix these. What is it? What the hell is this? Oh, the horn has to work. - Yep, yep, yep. - Come on. Pops, you got... come on, you got to hook me up. - Got to put all the horns on. - Detach it... Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God. Green. - Which one is this? - Say check, Pops. - Go check. - Can we get a check, please? Check! Please, God, let this be our last piece. - Thank you. - All right. Thank you, thank you, thank you... - We got to run. As soon as we can. - Yes. - Yes, baby. - - Come on, let's go. - Yes, thank you, sir. - Appreciate it. - Come on. Come on, come on. Carlos, we have to go the fastest - we've gone all day, okay? - So fast. This is everything. Thank you. - Thank you. - They're all right behind us, Carlos. - Thank you. - Muchas gracias, muchas gracias. Let's go. Come on. Where's our taxi? - Sir, sir. We're here. - You got to beat 'em. - Sir... Let's go, sir. - We have to be there now. We got to beat that team. - -We cannot let that team beat us. We're going to Parque. Más rapido. Tell him don't get lost. Yes! - Here we are. - Leo and Alana, you are team number seven. That's what we thought. This traffic is killing me. The Roadblock... We're literally in a footrace - with an Olympic sprinter and an Olympic jumper. - Yeah. And Frank and Jerry. Please, please, God, let us get there. We got to go faster than lightning, Carlos. Yeah, this is everything. It's not over until Phil says it's over. We're gonna keep fighting until the end, 'cause you just never know what happens to somebody else. - We got to be getting close. - I know. Hurry, sir. Hurry, sir, hurry, sir. Uh, we're gonna try to jump out here, then. And we got to go find Phil. - Over here. - Bye... bye, Carlos! Do you see Phil? Let's look on this side. - Let's go, Frank. - Let's go, Pop. - Adios. Come on. - Mucho gracias. Let's go. Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast! - Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Phil! Phil! Come on, let's go! Oh, my God. - Ah, we made it. - Wow. That was close, right? Kaylynn and Haley, I'm pleased to tell you that you are team number eight. Congratulations. We're always team number eight. - I know you got some important information... - Yeah. - ...from Leo and Alana. - They saved us. -Our best friends. And that saved you in this race, didn't it? - We owe them big. Really big. - We owe Leo and Alana our lives. Yeah. Let's go, baby. Come on. Come on. Jerry and Frank, very close, but the news is good. - -You are team number nine, and you will get to race in the next leg of The Amazing Race. - Well done. Well done. - Thank you. -Thank you. Kellie and LaVonne... unfortunately, you are the last team to arrive. And I am sorry to tell you that you have been eliminated from the race. Damn. - What happened? - It was just a mistake, not reading the whole clue. This is very, very hard, this race. - We did all we could do. - Yeah. We worked really hard. Uh, another life adventure under the belt. I've never went to a track meet and not made a final. I just expected to run this race, and I knew it was gonna be very, very hard and grueling, but I did not expect to go out on leg two. It's a great experience that we'll get to go home and talk about and laugh about. This definitely made our friendship, like, that much closer. - We even hugged, like, four times. - Yes, and we never hug. - It's like the four more times than I've hugged her... - We never hug. ...in 20 years. Captioning sponsored by CBS and TOYOTA. Next time on The Amazing Race, - in our first-ever trip to the Amazon... - Oh, what? - Yes, my man. - ...the Double U-Turn returns... - Holy smokes. - ...as teams face a chaotic market... - You guys missing something? - Our machete's gone. - ...frustration... - Damn it! - Oh,... - ...and tears. It just sucks, and I'm just sad and angry.
