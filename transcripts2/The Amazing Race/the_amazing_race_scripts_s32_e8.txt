 Previously on The Amazing Rac, seven teams raced to Amaty, Kazakhstan. At the Detour, DeAngelo and Gary battled... - I learned all of it. - Congratulations. ...while Leo and Alana were rattled. I don't know why this is so hard for us. Will and James seized a golden opportunity... There's one team behind you! Leo and Alana! ...to get their rivals yielded. We're so sorry!

 For Hung and Chee, old habits were hard to brea. - Where'd you get that from? - Over there. All right, that's what we're missing. I wasn't thinking "race smart." I was just my helpful self. In the end, Will and James won the leg... Team number one! - Yay! - ...and got some big news. The next leg of the race is a Mega Leg. Double the Detours, double the Roadblocks, double the distance. It's going to be the toughest leg so far. Meanwhile, Leo and Alana couldn't overcome the Yield. You have been eliminated from the race.

 Six teams remain. Who will be eliminated next? Give me a beard bump. Where are we going? Somewhere warm, please. "Fly to the cyber city of Hyderabad - in exotic India." - Ooh. Will and James will be the first to leave Kazakhstan and fly more than 2,000 miles south, to the middle of India. They'll land here in Hyderabad. Once known as the City of Pearls, it is now regarded as the cyber capital of India, and where teams will face the first-ever Mega Leg in the history of The Amazing Race. Double the Detours, double the Roadblocks, and double the distance. - India! - India. Cyber city. Let's go. Taxi? The Mega Leg is very intimidating. I know Phil said it was double everything, so we're anticipating a lot of curveballs coming our way today. - But we thrive under pressure. - We do thrive under pressure. Give me a little stress, give me a little anxiety, - and I can perform. - And we still have a 20-minute Yield in our back pocket. We played a huge part in the Yield last leg. It was definitely our goal to get a team to use their Yield. And it just worked out beautifully that it was the blondies. And we didn't have to do anything. All we had to do was give them a little nudge. Today, we still have our Yield and we're hoping that we can use it. Wow. Mega Leg in India? Dude, what's a cyber city? See you in India. We're both beach volleyball players and, like, a typical beach volleyball tournament will be anywhere from two to four days, and you're playing all day long. So I think this Mega Leg is gonna play to our advantage. Over the last couple of legs, we've given DeAngelo and Gary lots of game-changing information that's helped them significantly. And unfortunately, they haven't given us anything in return. It doesn't sit well with us. And so, we don't plan on sharing any additional information with those guys for the rest of the race. We're all gonna be on the same flight. Back to an even leg. Yeah, I believe our alliance of five is still going strong. - Yes. - 'Cause the five teams are still in an alliance, - they're still here. - Yeah. Once we're at the five, then we fight it out from there. We think that the Mega Leg could be used for our advantage. It could honestly kind of benefit us. If we are in the back, with a double leg, you have a chance to catch up. - Yeah. - So I kind of like it. We were both born in India, and then we came to the United States when we were, like, around two years old. And then, we went back to India pretty often, like, for summers. Hyderabad's probably the second biggest tech city - after Bangalore in India. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. And we're techies. So I hope they're gonna ask us to code something - in Hyderabad. - Yeah. We're at the airport. India, - here we come. - Yay! - Taxi! Taxi! - Taxi, taxi, taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi, taxi, taxi! Taxi, taxi, taxi! Okay, they're already in. - All right, we got to go very, very fast. - We got to go very fast. We're in a race, my friend. Come on, come on, come on! Come on. Let's go! So it's hectic, but it all kind of works. - Organized chaos. - Yeah, organized chaos. There you go. - I see Gary and DeAngelo are behind us. - Oh, my God. That's the blondes, I think. - We can't let them get ahead of us. - No! We have to beat them, we have to beat them. Faster, faster, faster! - Great job. - There we go. Now you're driving! - There's a clue box. - Come on. The clue? Okay. "Smog test three auto-rickshaws to receive your next clue from the pollution control technician." Hyderabad is home to more thn five million vehicles. And like all big cities, there's a constant struggle to keep the air clean. Authorities here use mobile pollution vans like this to do smog checks, something teams will now do by flagging down three auto-rickshaws. Once they have the results, they'll be rewarded with a clue. - -We have to grab an auto real fast right now. - Auto! Auto? - Oh, he's... None of these guys are stopping. - Oh, right here. - Right here. Right here. It's perfect. "Smog test three auto-rickshaws..." "...to receive your next clue from the pollution control technician." What's a rickshaw? Are you a rickshaw? What's a rickshaw? You're a pollution technician? What's a rickshaw? - Right here? Right here. - Hey, hey. Right here? These things? - All right, got a clue. - We got our clue. - Sir, sir! - - Over here. - James! James! - Get out of the street! - Sorry. Auto! Auto! - This way, this way. - Come with us, come with us. - Uh, uh, pollution test? - Please. Pollution test? Sir, sir, sir, can we go up here? - Come with us. - We're gonna go over here. Hey, what do we have to do? - Grab a rickshaw. - Just grab one. Find empty ones. How many rickshaws, Hung? Three? Three. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - Come here. - Hey, you want to do a smog test? - Come with us. - Come with us? Smog check! Smog check! - We need three. - We need three, we need three. All right, grab one. Hayley, you grab one. Okay. Right over here. Just keep going right over here. You're ours. Hey! Damn it, dude, we lost that one. We have to do a check, okay, sir? Check, okay. Right here, right here, right here, right here. Oh, you have to type. Okay. Okay. So what do we got to do? Oh, auto number. Auto number's T-S-10-U-A... T-S... Ten. Enter. Vehicle number. What's the vehicle number? - What's the vehicle number? - T-S... You basically had to enter in details about the auto-rickshaw that you stopped. Okay. And then you had to go take this pipe and put it in the back exhaust of the auto-rickshaw, which would then, like, read how much carbon dioxide the exhaust was emitting. Then you print it out like a certificate, and then you give it to the auto-rickshaw driver. - What do I do with this? - Into the exhaust. Right here? Vehicle number. Vehicle number! It's chaotic. There's a lot of parts to it. And the real trick is making sure you can flag down a rickshaw before the other teams, 'caue it's so crazy on the street. Smog check! Yes. Yes. Hung! Hung! A-P-10-W-4-2-3-6. Hey, hey, hey! Tuk-tuk! Can you come with us? Can you come? How do we get them to come? He's 16-80. Okay. Perfect. And then it'll print out certificate. Thank you, sir. Okay, we have to go grab two more now. Let's go get another one. Okay. - We're gonna get another auto. - Let's go. - We got one. - Yay! - Yes. Let's go get another car. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you. You can go. - Thank you. Thank you. - Okay. - We got to get another one. - I know that. All right, come on. This way, this way. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Go. This way, this way. - Pass. - Okay. Can we get another car for you? - Okay. - Okay. - Finished? - Finished. - Now we need two more, yeah? - Two more. Riley, let's try and get two at once. - Okay, thank you so much. - We'll be right back! Hey, hey! Tuk-tuk! - Smog check? - Check, check, check, check? Check, check, check, check! Oh, auto, auto, auto. Auto! Auto! We saw some team saying "tuk-tuk, tuk-tuk, tuk-tuk." We were like, "That's not what they're called here." Auto! Auto! Auto! So I think we kind of had, like, a teeny bit advantage just to know that they were called autos. - Yeah. - That kind of, like, helped us get our autos very quickly. Tuk-tuk! Tuk-tuk! - We're gonna go over there. - You're gonna come over here, yes? - Riley, grab them, too. - Hey, hey, hey! - Yes, yes, yes. - Hey, hey, hey! You can't take two, you can't take two. - You can only take one. - We can, we can! - You can only take one. - You can take more than one. - You can? - Yeah, we can! It's frustrating. Like, what are you talking about? We just got two rickshaws at once. - Smog check! - Is it all right if we come in? - I'm coming in. - Yeah, smog check. This way. - Please, please, please. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please, can we have you? Dude, what do we do? Everyone else is finishing. I think we're doing a good job for pollution. We got to make sure this city is healthy. Especially with Will studying public health, I think this is a good thing. I know Will's in his element right now. Right here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on. - Come on, come on. - Come on. Thank you. Come on, baby. One more! One more! Two? Okay. Let's go. One more. - We good? - Yeah, you're good. Come on. Let's go, we got to get the third one. Thank you. Which one's for the driver? This one. Complete? Complete? Okay, one more. We'll get another one. - We're last. - We are? - Yeah. Yep. - It's because we let that one taxi go. - Auto! - Aparna, Aparna! Come on. - Fast, fast, fast. - Go, go, go. Straight, straight, straight. Yay! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, come on. Come on. Yeah, yeah. This is three. This is the last one we're on. - Done. Done, done, done. - Done. Done! Done, done, done. Thank you, guys. Thank you. Okay. We got our second one done. This is our last one. I think we're still kind of ahead of the pack right now. I know Eswar and Aparna and us - have been kind of at it. - So everything's good. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you so much, sir. "Food App or Number Trap?" More than 350,000 people work in Hyderabad's I.T. companies, including Swiggy, this city's number one food delivery app. This Detour requires teams to partner up with a Swiggy phone operator who will help them deliver food to a hungry customer. Once teams make their way through the congested streets and complete three deliveries, they'll get their next clue. It's believed that India invented the number zero. Without it, computer technology as we know it today just wouldn't exist. Combined with the number one, these binary digits are the foundation of programming modern computers. Using motion sensor technology, teams must grab a sequence of binary numbers to crack a code which they'll need for their next clue. - "Number Trap." - All right, let's do this. Okay, let's go to our taxi. - There you go. - There you go. - This is all of them. - Yes. - Oh! Thank you, thank you! - Thank you so much. - Thank you, thank you. - Thank you. We're gonna do Numbers Trap. - Okay, let's go to Number Trap. Okay. - Okay. - Here you go! Thank you! - Yay! You were awesome! Yes! Uh, we're gonna do Number Trap. Number Trap. This is our third rickshaw. Oh, wait, wait, wait. It dropped out. Is everyone gone? - Except for the blondes? - I'm sorry, dude. Now it's in, now it's in! Can you please come with me? Just come right this way. This is a long light. - Oh, traffic. Lots of traffic. - Yeah, they, uh... Yeah, lots of traffic. - Do you see a T-Hub? - I don't see a T-Hub anywhere. - I don't know. T-Hub. Right. - T-Hub. Right, right, right. Yeah. T-Hub. Thank you, thank you, thank you. - T-Hub? Up here? - Let's go. - Come on, let's go. - Aparna, - you have the clue, right? - Yeah, I do. - How you doing? Come on. - Hey, how you doing? A platform and a large screen. - Oh. - They already grabbed that one. Okay, "raise your hand to start." Over here. Oh, go. "Catch all the highlighted ones and zeroes raining down." - So only the ones and zeroes. - Yeah. "If you successfully catch all of them, you will be presented with a binary code." Okay. "Decipher the code using the provided table to get your next clue." Okay, this is easy. We're both software engineer, and we code literally every single day for a living. So this challenge was meant for us. "Time to start the game." Oh, my gosh. What? How exciting! Get ready. I got both hands. Yeah. Let's go. You got two over there. - I got this side. - All right. You had to use your hands and every time a one or a zeo popped up, you had to highlight it. And if you missed one, you didn't pass, and you had to redo the whole thing. Oh, there's a one down there. Oh, we missed a one, bro. How'd you miss it? - That's your side. - Relax, bro. So focused. I missed a one. How many numbers are we catching? Oh, I missed one. Ah! I missed that one. There's a lot of them slipping through. How are we supposed to get all of this? Ah! Wow. This is gonna be tough. Okay. We missed three, I think. - Try again. - Okay. Pay attention, baby. Let's go in here. Oh, they're already here. Everyone else is in here. Another one around the corner. Oh, here. - Binary codes are ones and zeroes. - Yes, I understand, Chee. All right, this is for the driver. - Driver? - Maddison, we got all three. - Here. - Oh, yeah. Here we go. Here we go. We're gonna choose Number Trap. - Yeah. All right, let's go. - Are we good? - Done? Done. Thank you! - Okay, thank you! - "Food App." All right. - "Food App," we're picking Food App. Thank you! Dude, it was cha... it was crazy. It said in our clue you can wave down more than one. And we got two, and DeAngelo tried to snake one of ours, saying we couldn't do that. Like, damn. There's been a lot of mutual help in our alliance with Chee, Hung, and the boyfriends. Whereas with DeAngelo, they've been a lot of, like, take, take, take, take, take, and... they've, like, almost been withholding information that could potentially help us. It's just making the relationship with Hung and Chee and the boyfriends stronger, and making the relationship with Gary and DeAngelo weaker. It's basically what it's been doing. Come on, get that one. Oh, come on. There we go. Good. We got them all. - - Just wait. Yes! We got it. I'm a huge gamer, so the first part - was pretty easy. - Then it give you this binary code that you had to decode by looking at this binary code key. I'll take the first line. - You got the second line. - Okay. Who knew that, you know, a bunch of zeroes and ones could... - get you the next clue. - Anybody that does programming. Oh. Oh. - Okay. - I think they may have gotten it. Let's try to get this one, okay? Just stay concentrated, focused. Ah! I already missed one. - Really? - Yeah. A lot of software engineers - probably are gamers. - Sure, yeah. - But I'm not. I don't think... - Yeah. - ...you are, either. - I don't really play video games either, yeah. I'm so sorry. I'm almost, like, punching them. That helps me. Oh, I say that and then I miss it. - - Okay, let's try again. Do you know how close we are? I think we're lost. We get lost everywhere we go. Everywhere. - Oh, my God. - Oh, man. We don't know where we're at, we don't know where we're going. - This is insane. - This is a nightmare. We pulled over to ask for directions but Hayley and I are lost. Do you know how close we are or how far we are? Fingers crossed, we're going in the right direction, and we're almost to... - our Swiggy booth. - Yeah. Yes. That was close. Oh, my God, did we get it? Please, please, please, please. - We got it. - "Congratulations. Here is your binary code." Maybe, like, sweeping motions, maybe? Oh, okay. I'll try that. Oh, R-Riley, over here. I think I hear beard bros. The other side. Yes! Okay. This is gnarly, dude. God, these are brutal. Zero, one, one, zero, one... I got Y-U-O... Every eight numbers of one and zero stood for one lette. So once you have two letters, you could basically make out the word. You just write the word down and then you go back and make sure it was the rigt letter and you had it right. "You," Y-O-U. You... can... Are you almost done? It's a code, so look. I already got the first four. "You can find..." "G." That's it. Look at, look what I'm doing. - Going two hands? - Yeah, like a Hadouken. You don't have to be as accurate. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I like that. I got the middle. Dude, this is way easier. - Yes! - "U." F-O-U. In the four? Is it an "R"? - "R." - That's what I said. Let's kill this ending. Come on. - Okay, there we go, okay. - Yes! - Let's write it down. - Finally. Write this down. Okay, uh... My arms are getting tired, Chee. And my shoulders. Come on. Neither of us are video gamers. I don't think I'm really getting the hang of this. Um... still missing numbers here and there, but... just got to keep trying. "You can find the clue in the fourth floor..." - "Bunier"? - This one's wrong. - Which one? - It's the "I." Zero, one, one, zero. Ten. Eleven. - "K." - Bunker? Let's go. Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs. Right here, right here, right here. The boyfriends just got it. - Yeah. - So... We're right behind them, though. "In the..." So now it's space. We're almost there. Holy crap. "Bunker." This... a bunker. Hi. Oh, you have a clue? - Thank you! - Yay! Thank you! Okay, let's get out of here, so no one sees us. Yeah. "Travel by taxi "to the Q-Qutab Shahi Tombs "and search the area for the mausoleum "of Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah for your next clue. "Yield ahead. Do not miss the opportunity to use the power of the Yield." At this crucial time in the race, this is an opportunity for teams to stop another team racing by using their hourglass. The safest bet is to yield the blondies - because they don't have a Yield. - They can't retaliate. - They can't seek revenge. - And this way, we keep it clean with our alliance. It would be us. We would be the team, again, to get blood on our hands. But we'll do it with a smile. Do you think you're getting better or worse? - I'm-I'm the same. - I'm the same. - But I'm fine. - Okay. How many are you missing, roughly, in total? - Uh, maybe five. - Yeah, I'm missing about five. - Okay. Okay. - Let's keep going. - So it doesn't really make sense. - Maybe a number sign? Wait. Can't be right. - Okay, so it's one... - Zero, zero, one, zero, zero. So these are all wrong. So... So we wrote down all the numbers on a piece of paper. You had to get every single number. Every single number, otherwise it's off. - Right. - And you'd have to start over again. - Let's check it. - So... I'm gonna read the whole thing off to you. Ready? - Right there. Yeah. - Zero... - Okay, fourth floor bunker. - Yeah. - Okay, let's go. - Bunker. Bunker. This is gonna be "R." Let me see. Where's "R"? Fourth floor. "R." That's an "R." Okay, let's go. Is there a bunker up here? - It's a meeting room. - It's a meeting room? - Meeting room, Gary. - Yeah. Oh, it's The Bunker. That's what it's called. Hey, guys. Do you have our next clue? - Thank you very much. - Thank you so much. Stairs this way. Oh, okay. See ya, guys. - Thank you so much. Yes. - Thank you. Oh, right there. The Yield! Come on, baby. Up there. Grab it out of your bag. We are finally getting this out of our luggage and choose to yield the Blonde Bandits. We're trying to make our own luck in this race and they've had the best, so no... no hard feelings. Roadblock. "Who's ready to flip their lid?" Here in India, headwear is an important part of the national attire, representing a person's status and what community they're from. Teams will use this augmented reality interface to travel through a digital world and look for three distinctive turbans out of 18 unique possibilities. Then, traveling to the floor above, they must locate the person wearing the matching turban and place them on the marker that represents the column where the virtual person was found directly below them. Once they match the digital world with the real world, they'll get a clue. I'll do it? - Go ahead. - I feel like I have to do it. You got it, James. Right now I'm just trying to look for kings that I can match. I have to match three total with people upstairs at the tomb to get scrolls. This Roadblock is definitely time-consuming. I mean, right now, there's no other team here. So I kind of have a nice lead, but I don't want to lose it. We get lost everywhere we go. Yeah. We still have some time to catch up, - we just have to get there. - Yeah. A feeling we know all too well. Come on... - Keep going? - What else... - What do you want to do? - Well, we could switch Detours. - What do you want... - Um, uh, - let's try two more times? - Okay. - I don't think I'm getting better. - Okay. - You want to stay or go? - Uh... Here we go. It's here. Yeah. "Bar. Floor." We can't do this. We're debating whether we should switch Detours. We seem to be missing lots of numbers every game, so... I say we switch. Yeah, switch. We're switching Detours. We'll switch Detours. That's a tough one, tough one. I know. It's okay, Chee. We tried. Let's go. I think that's it. - Come on. - You have the clue, right? - Yeah. - It's the Yield. Rip it. "Who's ready to flip their lids?" I am. - You? Okay. - All right, I'll do it. How the hell does this even work? Oh, okay. This is what I'm supposed to be looking at. Okay, found one. So, one, two, three. Four in the middle. Once you found someone on your screen, you had to go to the top of the tomb and match who you found. He didn't have glasses. Come on, James. Can I bring you with me? Upstairs, there was 12 squares along the floor, which was how many columns there were underneath. So I knew I had to match one of the royal kings onto the exact column that I found underneath. Here? So that's a no. Oh, shoot. So you got to move this around and scan the pillar. And then the virtual king appears. It's new technology introducing you with the old world. - Thank you so much. - Okay, let's go. Hi. - Thank you. - Thank you. So there are three hungry customers waiting for you. - You'll be given a navigation phone... - Okay. ...as well as a phone for support. We have made it complicated for you by removing the GPSes from the app. - There are maps on the phone. - Okay. And there's a call operator to help you out. I'll give you two delivery bags. Is all three, uh, customers in these two bags? No, you have to go to the restaurant first. Oh, okay. - And this is your phone. - Okay. - Are there... - Start racing. Hi, I'm a Swiggy delivery person, so we need to go to the pickup point now. How do I go? Come out away from the building and take a... turn right. Turn right. Okay. We see Narsingh. We see Raymond. Turn right and then go a... Go straight. Okay, go right. We are passing a motel. Cool, cool. You are on the right track. Yeah, we're on the right track. Okay, keep on going? You have to be on the left-hand side of the road. When we started with the Swiggy app, it was a bit chaotic. The navigation gentleman told me the directions of where to go. The problem is, he can't see where I'm going. We're just passing KinderKare now. - Go straight. - We had a system of me telling him what I saw, and he would then confirm directions. Oh, we see a building saying "Oyo," O-Y-O. Oh, okay, okay. Right, you're on the right track. Please go ahead. Hyderabad Chefs, right here. Okay, we found it, we found it. Please pick up the parcel over there. Hi, we're your Swiggy food delivery. We need three packages, please. Pack it up, Chee. Come out from the Hyderabad Chefs restaurant. - Uh-huh. What direction? - Turn left. - Turn left? - Turn left. Go straight till you find the DLF Building. "D-L-F"? - CHEE: Okay. "B." Bunker? - "R"? - Yeah. "R" is zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, zero. - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go upstairs. Bunker. Do you have our next clue? Thank you, guys. - All right. - All right, let's go. We're back on the same road we have been, like, three times now. - Oh. This is The Platina. - What? We passed this so long ago. Hi. I'm gonna give you a navigation phone... - Okay. - ...and a phone for the operator. - Okay. - I'm gonna connect this phone to him. Okay. - Hello, good morning. - Hi, how are you? We're coming out the front and then I see the front of the building in front of me. Walk towards your right. You'll see a parking lot over there, right? Yes, I do. I see the parking lot. Yes. Before the parking lot, you have to take a right from there. Hi. Thank you very much. So back onto the same road. We're going to our first drop-off. Whichever one's closest. Blondes have been yielded. "Who's ready to flip their lids?" Look at those guys. - You got this. - I'll do it, I'll do it. - I got it. - You got it. Oh, there, I got one, finally. Okay. Red hat. Long line, checkered. All right. Let's go try this. - Red hat... - Let's go, Gary. This is in your wheelhouse. That one back there. Right there. So I got to place him? "The stone square directly above the spot you saw him." This one right here. Red hat. This is right? Or no? Okay. Oh, this is gonna be a long, long time. Let's go! I literally have not seen a single king yet. It looks like a virtual reality guy just hanging out. Oh, really? Oh. You go that close to it? This is so strange. The details on the turban, the details on the turban. You've got this, James. - Can you come with me? - Come on, James. Let's try it. You've got it, James. You got it. No scroll? What the h... Come on, babe. I'm so confused. - Okay, go right. - Here, here, here, here. Men's Hostel right here. We found it. Good job, good job, guys. We're here to deliver food. Blue and purple, so you have to find the person. Hi, do you need a food delivery? Purple sari? You have to sign and take the voucher from her. She's, uh, signing it right now. - Good job, guys. - Thank you, thank you. Thank you. I see DLF Cyber City on my left. I want you to reach the main entrance gate. Oh, okay. Okay, keep going? Opposite to the gate, you need to cross the road. Okay, so right now, if I'm walking towards the DLF gate, should I turn around and go the other way? Not the other way. You need to cross the road. So I need to go through the gates. Not through the gates. Across the road. Across the road. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Communicating with people in other countries is definitely intimidating. I don't know if he just, like, didn't really understand us at all, but I was not ready for this. Okay, so we are going the wrong way. You need to cross the road now. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, there we go. One, two, three... Gary, have you gotten a single show? Yes, I got this one right here. And this is... Where am I at? So I am looking at... that vault wall right there and those stairs. Got it. Third pillar in from here. - All right. - That's a confident look right there, Gary. I think this is it. Right here. Perfect. Thank you. - One. - Oh, he got it. One down. - Hey, get out of here. - I'm trying to... Like, come on, dude. Mm, could be it. I'm looking for, like, a certain stone. Oh, dang it. This is tough. Let's try you. You come with me, yeah. You never know. You can always get that hole in one, you know? Yes. Thank you. There's one. - Good work, Riley. - Know what I'm doing. Nice job, buddy. So what do we look for next? At the right-hand turn, you're gonna find the park to your right. Park? Y-Yes, I see it. Second customer appears inside the park. And we're going into the park? Find the person with the red hat. Oh, the red hat, red hat. Come here. Red hat. Hello, we have food for you. - Hello. - Thank you so much. Come on, Chee. Can you sign the-the voucher, please? - Thank you so much. - Thank you. So where do we go now, sir? Come out the front of the park, take right. - Take a right, okay. - Thank you. Haley and I are dropping off the food at Sri Sai Amrutha Executive Men's Hostel. We're hoping this is the area of the hotels. We see lots of hostels, we're just hoping it's the right hostel. On the left is the Srinidhi Men's PG Hostel. Anything else? No. I think we need to turn around, Kaylynn. I think we went too far. It's really hard. Can you come down here for me? Yes. I think I figured it out, finally. Please. The details in the turban, the details in the turban. I think I figured this out. Okay. No? What the heck? No. No. He's already placed him. They've already done it. Once one gets figured out, you can't use that one again. So you got to make sure you use a different one every time. And nobody else is used. Yes. Think it's you. You come with me. I just grabbed the first blue one I could find. Me and Eswar are going for the same one. So I just had to grab one. Where did I see him? You. Ah! Oh! All right. - Cool. - Good job, good job, Eswar! Come on, come on. You got it. Frickin' guy, took my blue. We took a right out of the park. You have to turn the right, right turn. There's one big building, a five-floor building. On the, on the top of the floor, you're gonna see the board of Ethno Fitness Studio. Ethno... it's E-Ethno Fitness Studio. It's up here, Chee. Left. You have to go on the fifth floor. You have to find the person, red T-shirt. - Fifth floor, red T-shirt. - Fifth floor. - The elevator's slow... - Taking the stairs. ...so we're taking the stairs. Fifth floor. Please go ahead. Please go. - Red T-shirt. - Hello. Hello, sir. - We have a Swiggy delivery for you. - We have... - We have food for you, sir. - We found him. Good job. - Here you go. - Sign, please. Are you gonna do the voucher? Yes, we have a signed voucher. - Thank you so much. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Yeah, we're done. - Go back to Platina. I'm looking at A-Y-Y-A-P-P-A Heights. Mm, no. Kaylynn took over, she's on the phone. I think we're down the wrong road. He's giving good directions, but everything I say, he's not recognizing. So, because he's not recognizing anything, I think we need to get off this road. Okay, we went the wrong end. Lines, lines, lines. Big thing in the middle, and it's on the side. All right, let's go. - Can you come with me? - Yeah. Right here. Yes. Gary got the second one. Thank you. That's two. Yes, please. Yes, baby. Thank you, my sir. Getting lucky. We're back in the Patina building. Well, good job, guys. Bye now. All the best. Thank you. - Hello. - Can I have the receipts back and the phones? - Phone, Chee. - I already gave it. - Congratulations. - Thank you. You can become an excellent delivery executive. - Thank you. - There you go. Thank you so much. - "Yield ahead." - "Do not miss the opportunity - to use the power of Yield." - Let's go. - It's on the fifth floor? - Yeah, it's on the fifth floor. You'll find a man with a red T-shirt. Hi. Red T-shirt. Did you order Swiggy? - Yeah. - Awesome. Can I get you... to take... sign this receipt? Lovely. Wonderful. - Thanks, love. - Thank you. - Enjoy your pasta. - Good. I just don't get why I'm doing it wrong. I know it's the detail in the turban, and I've done it, like, eight times. I'm so annoyed. James is really frustrated and when he gets frustrated, he gets in his head and, like, really frazzled, so... I think he's a little frustrated right now. It's you. I know it's you. Come on. Oh, I hope you're right. How? I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I had a huge lead and now I lost it. Okay, can someone explain the pillars to me? I don't get what I'm doing wrong. Why do you guys keep referencing that? There's 12 pillars... There's 12 pillars up there, so why are you looking out there? I just... 'cause that's how I line it up. 'Cause I thought I had this one, but it ended up being the la... very last one. - There wasn't a sta... a thing for it. - Oh. - So it was all the way down. - Like, do the far one, doesn't... there just isn't one there. Yeah, so you just got... That's why I'm using that as my reference. I'm using that walkway. So I've always been one pillar off. - Could be, yes. - One, two, three, four. In the front, a seahorse. One, two, three, four. Seahorse in the front. One, two, three, four, seahorse in front. Come with me. This is my third one, if I get it right. Tell me some good news, my friend. Yeah, baby. - - There you go. All three scrolls, my friend. Thank you, my sir. - Good work, dude. - Thanks. Yep. That's three, D. Thank you. Let's go, D. I'll take it downstairs. We were here first and now two teams have left already. "Travel by auto-rickshaw to Charminar and search for your next clue." Oh, we know exactly where that is. - Yeah. Let's go. - Let's do it. "Travel by auto-rickshaw to Charminar - and search for your next clue." Let's go. - Come on, come on. Usually after you finish, that's the end of it, but we are on the... - Mega Leg. - So it continues. - Yes. - And we had to go on and do more. Who's the fastest? - - Fast? Charminar? We're in a tuk-tuk! They might be 25 seconds ahead of us. It's the pillars. "Who's ready to flip their lids?" - You, Chee. Okay. - I will. - Please be right. - You've got it, James. You've got it. I'm right? Thank you. Okay, I need two more. Okay. All right, found one. Let's go. Three posts on the right. It gave me a little bit of an energy boost to see that we had caught up, 'cause I thought we were in last place. Oh. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. All right, let's go find some more. - I only have one, I got two more. - Love you. You're doing great, you're doing great. Oh, I see a park, I see a park. Go into the park now, and there will be a guy with a red hat. - And he's inside of the park? - Yeah. It's inside of the park. Oh, I see him, I see him. We have your food. - Thank you. - Will you please sign the receipt? - Yeah. - Excellent, excellent, excellent. - Enjoy. You're welcome. - Thank you. Hello, sir. Can you come down? I-I hope I found the right match. Oh. Thank you so much. I have one more to go and then I can get my next clue. Can I have you come down here, please? Come on, James. Thank you very much. One more. Let's go. This way. Thank you. All right, one more to go. Good job, Eswar. Let this be right, Lord. Please be right. Thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Good luck, you guys. Charminar? Thank you. James just got it. Uh, so it's just me and Chee. And then the blondes aren't here yet. Ugh, come on. I see a tree. This is it, the hostel. You're looking for a woman wearing a blue and a purple checkered sari. Oh, hi. - We have an order for you. - Hi, we have your order. Thank you very much. Enjoy. Come on, Haley! I'm back to the Swiggy. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Good luck. Thank you. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. - Awesome. - Congratulations. Thank you so much. - Let's go. - "Do not miss your opportunity - to use your Yield." - All right, we don't have a Yield anymore, so hopefully we're not yielded when we get there. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. Chee and Hung just left. Eswar's still down there. This sucks because we were here third, and we're definitely not third anymore. All right, Haley, here's the tombs. Is that it? Come on. Haley and I know we're in last, and I see the picture Uh-oh. I'm just praying it's not us. - It looks like us. - We got yielded. Haley and I got yielded. Who did it? Bitches. Will and James yielded Haley and I. So here's our Yield. We now have to start it. - 20 minutes! - It's a 20-minute Yield. - They got us. - They got us for 20 minutes. I can't believe they yielded us. This feel like it's a total different day now. - It does. - Like, you do realize that would've been the end - of the race, after that one. - Yeah. Let's go. Hello. What? Okay, I got to go check out what this guy looks like. I can't believe they did that. Haley and I are sitting out our Yield time. - We're in time-out. - Thank you. Captioning sponsored by CBS Next time on The Amazing Rac, Kaylynn and Haley scramble to get back in the game... Thank you so much. Okay, thank you very much. ...while Eswar and Aparna sink their teeth into it. Get the top part. That's the hard part. This is disgusting. And alliance members... It all has to fit in the one ruler. ...work in secret. The Mine Five is officially dead.
