 PHIL KEOGHAN: Previously onThe Amazing Race, eight teams raced to Paris, France. Kaylynn and Haley got off to another slow start... -We almost-- Okay. I'm sorry. -Ow. ...while Will and James got help from an unlikely source. -Can you please help me? -I can help you back up. KEOGHAN: In Chantilly, brothers Maddison and Riley looked out for their alliance... RILEY: When you deliver the pies, they throw pies at you, so be careful. They throw pies at you, so be careful, okay?

 [laughs] -...and won the leg. -You are team number... -one. -Yes! KEOGHAN: Michelle and Victoria were lost in Paris... Oh, my God. Freaking out. ...and came up short. You have been eliminated from the race. -I love you. -I know. KEOGHAN: Seven teams remain. Who will be eliminated next? -[Chee laughs] -[grunts] Chee, I can't see. Yeah. "Travel by train to Berlin, Germany."

 KEOGHAN: Riley and Maddison will be the first to leave the City of Light and travel by train more than 500 miles to the capital city of Germany, Berlin. Home to Europe's largest train station, and a wall that separated East and West Germany for a quarter-century until 1989. Teams will find their first clue here at the East Side Gallery in this symbolic Berlin suitcase. Let's go, let's go. We are leaving in first place. There's a taxi right there. RILEY: I think we're doing a pretty good job reading the clues. We need to do a lot better job of all the small, finer details. I'm guessing this is kind of an equalizer. All the teams s-should more or less be on the same train. Bonjour. We are heading to the train station. CHEE: There's lots of tough teams. Hung and I just need to continue to race hard and not make any big mistakes. Over the last few legs, we've been working with Eswar and Aparna, Gary and DeAngelo, the boyfriends and the beards. It's part of a five-team alliance that originated down in the salt mines. We work together, give each other tips to help-help each other out. And we have complementary skills, too, so I think that, uh, we'll continue to work with them. It's nice to be leaving early, it's nice to be at the front of the pack. Hopefully it's advantageous for us. We're hoping that Kaylynn and Haley are still in it. We're curious to see what happened. If we have to drive in Germany, I think we have to improve -on our driving abilities. -Yes. -And communication while driving. -Ha. GARY: We are going to Berlin, Germany by train. We're gonna ask when we get there about, uh, what the other teams took. We have five teams in our alliance. Right now it's us, the beard bros, Chee-Hu, brother/sister and the boyfriends. And so far, everything's stayed true. DeANGELO: Come on. Germany. Oh, my goodness. The Amazing Race so far has been harder than Berkeley Engineering has been. You don't just get to take a midterm and chill the heck out. It's like, you are just consistently thinking about the competition, and it's even more cutthroat than Berkeley was. JAMES: The train station just opened, and six teams are here. Right now we're just waiting to see who that last team is. It's either gonna be the blondies or Michelle and Victoria. -Wow. -We're so pumped. -We're so excited. -Germany. Like, this is gonna be, like, such a cool leg. HALEY: Hopefully self-driving will not be involved. That was a nightmare. We don't know how, like, we haven't been eliminated yet. We've just dodged all these bullets. KAYLYNN: Haley and I have worked to support ourselves our entire lives, so it's kind of relating back to us in the race, that you're always having to land on your two feet -and depend on yourselves and each other. -Yeah. So that's what we've been doing all this time. -Our whole lives. -Yeah. Yeah. -Thank you so much. -Have a great day. Thank you. Merci. We don't know who the last team is. Oh, is-is that the blondes down there? -Blondes. -It is. -Oh, my God. -It is the blondes. [both whooping] Yay! [clamoring] KAYLYNN: We came in last again. -DeANGELO: Wow. -GARY: This is crazy. CHEE: All of us are just dumbfounded on how that happened. HUNG: That is absolute proof that you have to keep on racing, 'cause you never know what place you're actually in. KAYLYNN: Everybody's on the same train, and we're on our way to Berlin. So we're super excited for this leg, -we hope that this one is ours today. -[sneezes] Sorry. -[chuckles] Thank you. -Yeah. KAYLYNN: We're going to Germany! ♪ ♪ [train whistling] -Let's go. -Let's go. -Okay, let's go, Leo. -Come on, Haley. -MADDISON: Go, go, go. -APARNA: We got to get a taxi. -DeANGELO: Come on, we got to go, we got to go. -RILEY: Taxi! -MADDISON: Taxi. -Right behind you, Chee. -DeANGELO: Taxi! Come on, Gary. You know East Side Gallery? You'll take us? Thank you, thank you, thank you. -Taxi! Okay. -Every one's taken. And everyone is taking off. We need to find a taxi. -East Side. -East Side Gallery. Danke, danke. -GARY: Go. -DeANGELO: No, no, no. Go. We're racing them. I believe that cab right there is going to the same place. East Side Gallery at the Berlin Wall? It's a part of the Berlin Wall, yeah. KAYLNYNN/HALEY: Berlin Wall? HALEY: And we need to go superfast. -We're in a race. -We're in a competition. Go to the East Side Gallery. -Awesome. -Okay. -Thank you so much. -Thank you. They snagged those taxis so fast. -I know, we... -It really depends on how fast you run. And I run really slow. [both laugh] CHEE: We are heading to the Berlin Wall right now. This place is a really big piece of history that I know nothing about. Kind of World War II, German history. It wasn't World War II, it was Cold War. -Was it? I thought Cold War... -Yeah, the Berlin Wall... ...was with Russia, no? -Oh, maybe it is Cold War. -It is the Cold War. -RILEY: Is this the Berlin Wall? -MADDISON: Yeah. APARNA: Wow. This is beautiful. It was really cool to be at a place where there was a lot of history. That's probably one of my favorite moments onThe Amazing Race so far. ESWAR: Perfect. APARNA: Thank you so much. CHEE: Let's stop here. -Come on, Gar. -ALANA: This is a run. -Got it? All right. -Yep. CHEE: Okay, let's go-- hey, hey, the girls. HUNG: Did you guys find anything? No, not yet. CHEE: It's a long gallery. JAMES: Look at all the graffiti. This is so cool. Every team's here looking for the clue, and we haven't found anything. DeANGELO: Is this box right here it? -WILL: The suitcase, suitcase. -Yes. JAMES: Yes. Will, come on. DeANGELO: That might be it. Come on, Haley, come on. Come on, Haley. Slide it open. Slide it open. ALANA: Good job, guys. -GARY: All the clues. -DeANGELO: Come on, come on. -Right here, right here, right here. -MADDISON: Let's go. -I got one. -Route Info. "Drive a Trabant." Teams will now drive themselves around in a Trabant, a cherished icon that was made in Germany until the Wall came down in 1989. "Drive yourselves to Teledisko..." "...the world's smallest disco party. Dance the night away to receive your next clue." "Choose one of the marked Trabants parked along Muhlenstrabe." RILEY: Okay, go. RILEY: Oh, they're right there. -These small guys. -MADDISON: Oh, these are them. -This one? -Sure. How do you open it? -Okay. -All right. -Okay, what is this? -HALEY: I don't know. -ESWAR: Aparna, open it. -APARNA: I can't. Oh, I got it. GARY: This thing is tiny. DeANGELO: He was smooshed and tucked into that thing. You looked like a big-mouth bass in a sardine can. -GARY: That's ridiculous. -[laughs] Hey, do y'all know where to go? We got to ask someone for directions. Maddison, you figure out the directions, I'm gonna figure out the car. -Oh, my gosh. -[chuckles] Oh, my God. RILEY: It came with, like, a bunch of instructions. I didn't comprehend any of it. I didn't even know how to turn it on. WILL: How do you get into gear? JAMES: The Trabant is a very interesting vehicle. We're figuring it out. Um, I have faith that we will, just because of our debacle in Paris. Deep breaths, baby. -[gears grinding] -No! It's not working! Hopefully, uh, we can get there. -[engine stalls] -Okay, cool. GARY: Teledisko. It's not far. -[horn honking] -HUNG: Good job, Chee. Rock and roll. Good job, Chee. CHEE: Wow, I don't know what I'm doing. -I'm just gonna stay in first. -Okay. MADDISON: Good work, Riley. You got this, dude. RILEY: A normal stick shift, I mean, that's-that's easy. This one was, like, where the windshield wipers are. I've never seen anything like it. The first thing I thought of was, "How are the blondes gonna drive this?" We have no idea how to start this car. -It's, like, an old-school stick. -It's so weird. -Is this, like, a regular car? -KAYLYNN: I don't know. JAMES: Be careful, baby. [horn honking] Oh, my goodness. -What are we doing? -[horn honking] -Whoo! -Sorry. There were just... -Uh... -[horn honks] APARNA: Good job, Eswar. ESWAR: This is insane. Okay. "Teledisko, 99 Revalerstr." -DeANGELO: What is this right here? -GARY: This is it. 99. That looks like a disco up there. When it comes to nightlife, Berlin beats them all. This city is arguably the best party town in Europe, if not the world. And the latest, greatest craze? Teledisko. Where you can get your own disco ball, smoke machine and strobe lights. A three-minute mini-disco that'll cost you only four euros. This is where teams will get in the groove for their next clue. -Right here? -Right here. GARY: We're about to do a little dance party. And it's gonna take a photo. Get ready. All right, let's go. DeANGELO: Dude, I don't think we can both fit in there. GARY: We got to dance until the music stops. [dance music playing] -Oh, there it is. There it is. -Ah! GARY: It's barely enough room for the both of us. You got to try and jump around and dance and my head's almost hitting the roof of the thing. ♪ Yabadabaday, yoboboboboy...♪ There it is. There it is. Disco boy! ♪ And hold you tight, I want to make you mine tonight...♪ DeANGELO: We wentNight at the Roxbury real quick. -[laughs] -I was like... [laughs] DeANGELO: Oh, God. "Teledisko"? -RILEY: Oh, right in here. -Teledisko, that's the machine, I think, right there. Good work. ♪ -[music stops] -♪ Bum-bum...♪ DeANGELO: All right. -Dance until the music stops? -GARY: Yes. It's long. Come on, come on, come on. Hey, guys. -DeANGELO: Did we get our picture? -GARY: Yeah, it's right here. -DeANGELO: Look at us, Gary. -"Drive to Andel's Hotel and park out front." KEOGHAN: Teams must now drive to Andel's Hotel, where they'll encounter a Yield. This is an opportunity for teams to stop another team racing by using their hourglass. -GARY: So we got to drive here. We got to find where this is at. -Yeah. -WILL: Is this 99? -JAMES: Yes, it is. Go in, go in, go in. -You guys want to come in with us? -Yeah. -[laughs] -All right. Can you tell us where this is at? -DeANGELO: Andel's Hotel? -Can you look it up and show us? JAMES: This is cool. I'm having extreme FOMO. [laughs] DeANGELO: How far is it from us? GARY: That's not bad at all. DeANGELO: Thank you. ♪ Hey, hey, hi, ho.♪ [cheering] -You did it. -Holy moly. Grab our photos. So we got to figure out Andel's Hotel. We're gonna do some Teledisko, and I'm so happy it's just the two of us. [laughs] APARNA: I feel like we've driven down this street before. Yeah. Why is it so difficult to find? It's got to be somewhere around here. APARNA: I know. Hopefully the other teams are having the same struggle. I want to do a U-turn and go back to that street. Like, if we go right here, we could just get lost -in the backstreets of Berlin. -Okay. LEO: Okay, here we go. ALANA: We're making a U-turn 'cause we missed our street. We're behind the pack right now, and it's frustrating. [grinding] -KAYLYNN: This is very, very hard to do. -This-- Oh, my God. We keep stalling. All right, find that sweet spot. You got it. You got it. -Am I driving? -You're driving. You're driving, dude. KAYLYNN: All right, Haley. -WILL: What a disco... -[both whooping] ♪ -[camera shutter clicking] -Surprise! More fog. -Oh. -Oh, yay. We did it. -Oh, wow. -I can't breathe. So much fog. Here's our photo. -Making memories in Berlin. -We have to go. -Good work, Riley. -I'm gonna push the car. -Do y'all know where you're going? -RILEY: Yeah. -JAMES: Are y'all stuck? -No. -I don't know how to reverse this car. -JAMES: Oh, my gosh. -WILL: Can we follow you? -CHEE: Yes. -Okay. -JAMES: Will, come on. We need to go. [horn honking] -Are we going right here? -Yeah, right here, -and then left, Riley... -Yeah. ...and then a right back on the main road. [engine revving] Oh, that's 'cause the emergency break is on. Ha, ha. HUNG: Where's James and Will? -Why are they not behind us? -Oh, I don't know. I was just so focused on following beard bros. No, it-- no, they right-- they were right behind us, Chee. -Oh, they were? Okay. -Yeah. So hopefully up at this light, they'll catch up. [horns honking] We were hoping to follow Hung and Chee and the beards. We weren't that far behind them and we still ended up losing them. -[engine revving] -I don't know what's happening. My foot's off the clutch and it's not going. JAMES: What the hell is going on? My f-- I don't know what's going on. [engine revving] -We have to go. -I don't know what to do. It's not working! -[horns honking] -Geez Louise. Clutch is out. So we can't go anywhere. We think that the clutch of the Trabant -just quit on us. -[laughs] JAMES: Sir? Where is Andel's Hotel? -Thank you, thank you. I like your coat. -WILL: Please... You look nice and warm. Around the curve, straight, and then right onto Landsberger. Got it. We have two options: one, either fix the clutch-- and, like, come on, we're not gonna fix the clutch-- or two, run. And we trained for the race, so running, obviously, was the better option. WILL: Come on, James. DeANGELO: Talk to me, Gary. GARY: "Drive to Andel's Hotel and park out front." -DeANGELO: It's right here. -Okay, yeah, that's where we're going. DeANGELO: Oh, there's the clue box right there. [exhales] GARY: Yield. BOTH: We choose not to yield anybody. -Roadblock. -"Who wants to feel the wind in their hair?" This Roadblock gives teams a chance to drop into Berlin when they do a face-forward rappel from the top of this 180-foot hotel. But as they plunge to the ground, they'll need to unscramble these letters to solve a word puzzle. "When you reach the bottom, correctly answer the question to receive your next clue." So I'm doing the Roadblock. How you doing? I'm DeAngelo. I'm ready to walk down the face of this building. I'm-I'm a little jealous that he gets to do it. We've both been looking forward to something heights-wise. 'Cause we know some teams got a little bit of fear of heights, so I'm looking forward to see him do this. Perfect. Please walk to the top level. All the way to the top? All right. How many flights of stairs is this? [exhales] Apparently there's 15 flights of stairs. [exhales] 15 floors. Oh, God. So guess how we had to do it. We had to I, Robotit up the steps. I'm hoping we taxi-cabbing it from here on out, though. CHEE: Nice job, Maddison. MADDISON: Wasn't that bad. It's a Roadblock. You got it, right? -It's gonna be heights. I got it. -You got it. RILEY: Pretty much realized that it was gonna be something to do with heights, and we've agreed that that's not my thing. "Who wants to feel the wind in their hair? -You must not weigh more than 200..." -Me. No, Chee, it's gonna be falling-- it's gonna be jump-- -jumping. -Oh, okay. -All right, you. -Me. CHEE: Oh, Hung is completely fine with heights. You know, we talked before the race started that she would handle the height stuff, so I'm confident she's gonna do it. -Here I come. -MAN: Hi. Okay, you step over this side. -Yeah. -Step up, forward. Ooh, can I look down? Oh, my gosh. Gary, you owe me, dude. MAN: We are ready. Let's go. -[exhales] -Yep. Correct. Perfect. -Good job. -DeANGELO: Oh, God. GARY: Come on, D. Let's go, D. DeANGELO: Oh! Oh! -Slow down! Slow down! -[laughter] -That's awesome. -So trippy. -That is awesome. -Oh! -That is so cool. -GARY: That is awesome. DeANGELO: Oh. Oh! [whoops] You're going way too fast. GARY: That looks awesome. I'm so jealous. -DeANGELO: Hey, you shouldn't be. -[chuckles] Very good. -Come on, D. -So... Unscramble the letters. What's the word? -[chuckles] -Unscramble the letters? Yes. -You didn't see the letters... -DeANGELO: No. -...on your way down? -No. I didn't see any letters. Like, all I saw was my life flashing before my eyes. Let's go again. -LEO: Teledisko? -MAN: On the left-hand side there. -Thank you. Thank you. -ALANA: Okay, thank you. -Excuse me? -Where's Teledisko? ESWAR: Yeah. Okay, thank you. KAYLYNN: Do you know where the Teledisko is? He said you're gonna come to a right and t-- a light and take a right. -Thank you so much. Thank you. -Thank you, sir. KAYLYNN: Seems like it's relatively very close. We're almost there, James. It's this red light. -JAMES: Really? -There it is. -"Andel's Hotel." -Babe, we got it. DeANGELO: We're gonna have to work together. We're gonna work together? Do we have to find something? We got to make an agreement, though. -Yes. -Let me-- you gonna have to wait down there -until I get down. -I will wait till you get down. We got to unscramble letters going down the building. -But I'm not sure what they were because I was just going. -Okay. Okay. DeAngelo, I think that he was just panicked. He made me promise not to leave without him, and I was like, "That's fine." Once I get it, I-I'll give it to you. -You have my word. My word is good. -Okay. Maddison? Let's do it. [whoops] RILEY: You got this, Maddison. Oh, my God. I feel like Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible. -CHEE: Come on. -RILEY: Come on, Maddison. Nice. Oh. -And feet down. All right. -RILEY: You got this. Did you see the letters? No? On your way down? -MADDISON: "Andel's"? -No, sorry. -Okay, all right. -All right. "Who wants to feel the wind in their hair?" That would be me. -Hi, hello. Hey. -MAN: Step over. HUNG: As I was being hooked up, I saw letters, and they're lit up on the right side. And I started to unscramble those letters. CHEE: All right, here she goes. I'm so scared. Oh, God. I'm so scared. Oh, God! -Oh, God. -Straighten your legs. Straighten your legs. [whimpering] Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [wailing] -[laughs] -GARY: I thought she was good with heights. I thought she was good with heights. HUNG: Oh, my God! Oh, my God! -She is screaming. -Calm down! -[laughter] -CHEE: Calm down! -HUNG: Oh, my God! -Just breathe! Oh, my God, oh! -What the heck? -That is hilar... -[laughter] -Serious. HUNG: Oh, I love you so much. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay. Unscramble the letters? "Sauerkraut." Wow. Yes. -Congratulations. -[sniffles] Thank you. -Good job. -Oh, man. God, Chee. "Detour: Belt It Out or Belch It Out." [piano playing] [clucking rhythmically] You're listening to the dulcet tones of the Berlin Comedian Harmonists singing an old German classic, "Ich wollt', ich war' ein Huhn," "I Wish I Were a Chicken," something singers have been doing here at the Ballhaus Berlin cabaret since 1905. Teams must now sell their performance of this song to receive their next clue. Beer yoga has created memorable poses like this, the Beer Boat. Teams will now learn a sequence of beer yoga poses and then teach them to a class to get their next clue. "Travel by taxi." Okay. We're gonna do Belch It Out. Do you need the car? Oh, praise God. -Let's go. -CHEE: On the way up, DeAngelo had failed the first time. I gave him my word that I would tell him what it is. -I was like, "I'll stay." -Are you sure? Okay. -GARY: Let's go, D. -Okay. HUNG: The word is sauerkraut. -Sauerkraut. -Okay, unscramble the letters. "Sauerkraut." -And here we go. Good job. -RILEY: Come on, dude. -DeANGELO: You guys got to go somewhere else? -Yes. -Oh, okay. -I'm gonna wait for Maddison. I'm... I'm-a wait on him, too. MADDISON: Oh, man. ♪ Yabadabaday, yoboboboboy♪ ♪ I want to be your disco boy♪ ♪ I want to dance with you, I want to hold you tight...♪ [whoops] That was so fun! Leo's now my disco boy. ♪ Yabadabaday, yoboboboboy...♪ [both babbling] ♪ I want to dance with you, I want to hold you tight...♪ -[camera shutter clicking] -[whooping] -RILEY: Come on, Maddison. -MADDISON: This is hard. We're working with Chee-Hu, we're working with the beard bros and we're working with the boyfriends. We're holding our pact together like we said we were gonna do, with the top five. Hey, did you get it, Maddison, or you need help? "Sauerkraut" is the answer. -Unscramble the letters. -"Sauerkraut." -Great. -Thank you. Are you gonna let, uh, Will know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. For sure. You got this, babe! -So you want to do yoga? -I would say yes. Let's do the yoga. Yeah, let's do that. -DeANGELO: We'll catch you guys. -GARY: Come on. -DeANGELO: Taxi! -CHEE: I see one taxi. -DeANGELO: Taxi! -HUNG: Taxi! Taxi! CHEE: Okay, go, go, go. -DeANGELO: Taxi? Perfect. -HUNG: Oh, my... DeANGELO: This is where we're going right here. Oh, this is nice. Bro, there is no way I would've got that without their help. [laughs] The alliance that we made is holding real strong, bro. JAMES: You're doing great, babe. I think our alliance with the other teams right now is gonna come through, which is gonna be really nice. I really, really want to get out of here before the other teams show up. [laughter] -Do we have to do this again? -[whoops] Oh, my God. [laughter] -Oh, my God. -Okay, let's go. APARNA: We are searching for Andel's Hotel. I can see it. It's, like, right there. Andel's. I don't have any second thoughts about being generous with the answers with beard bros or boyfriends, but, um... NFL players a-a little bit, uh, unsure. -They're still out there, looking for a cab. -Are they? -Yeah. -Ugh, that sucks. HUNG: Taxi! Taxi! -WILL: Is it a word? -MADDISON: "Sauerkraut." -"Sauerkraut." -James, you guys are good. -Thanks, guys. -"Sauerkraut." Wow! How do we get taxis? It's just right there, Leo. We just got to go right there. LEO: Keep going. You're doing great. "Who wants to feel the wind in their hair? -You must not..." -Me. Me, me, me. -I want to jump off something. -Okay, fine. Okay. -Please, please, please. -She's gonna do it. -We choose not to yield anyone. -The only people behind us are Kay-- can you open this? I can't... LEO: We knew that we were second to last, but we weren't gonna yield Kaylynn and Haley at any point because of how, uh, massively they saved us earlier -in the Amazon. -That's true. Yeah. Okay, I'll do t-this Roadblock. HUNG: Taxi! CHEE: Oh, there's one. -Yeah, beard bros got one. -RILEY: Yo, yo, yo, let's go! Let's do this. Let's sing. Let's sing. -JAMES: We need a taxi. -Let's go this way. -JAMES: Is that a taxi down there? -Taxi! JAMES: Right there, right there, right there. -Taxi, we come with you? -Yes. -Taxi, right there! Taxi! -Yeah. I see it. I see it! Taxi, taxi, taxi! Taxi, taxi, taxi, taxi, -taxi, taxi, taxi... -Taxi, taxi. -HUNG: He drove right past us. -Can't believe this is actually happening. HUNG: Oh, my gosh. Come on, taxi. Man. DeAngelo and Gary took the only taxi that we saw, and I'm very upset with DeAngelo because he came down, he didn't know any of the letters, he didn't know any of the word. DeAngelo and Gary aren't helping the alliance. They just bring it up when it's helpful to them. And for me, um, trust and loyalty are-are very important. Our generosity is costing us some time. Taxi! And here we go. Straighten your legs. -Lean forward. -[gasps] ESWAR: Good job. Let's do it, Aparna. Come on! [whoops] Oh, my God, that's insane. K-U-R... E-U-R... T-A. ESWAR: You got this. -Taxi? -Oh, Hung-Hung. Oh, taxi. -Taxi... -CHEE: Taxi. -Taxi, taxi! -Is he stopping for us? CHEE: Yes. Good. -Finally. -HUNG: Hi. Here we go. -We're gonna do a little yoga. -Yep, right here. [exhales] Here it is. Welcome to beer yoga. -GARY: Beer yoga. All right. -DeANGELO: Beer yoga. Okay. Your challenge is to learn a sequence of four poses and then you're gonna go downstairs and perform it. -Oh, okay. All right. -GARY: Okay. INSTRUCTOR: So the first rule of beer yoga, after every sip of beer, we go... [exhales] -Now take a sip together. -[both exhale] You must remember the names of the poses. First one is called Beer Salutation. Beer comes to the sky. Exhale, the beer all the way down to the mat. GARY: So yoga here in Germany is completely different than any yoga we've ever seen. Inhale, the right foot to the sky. Exhale, the right foot all the way between your hands. Grab your beer, inhale up. Beer Warrior One. GARY: Beer Warrior One. Beer Warrior Two, and take a sip. [exhales] You take all that to the left-hand side. DeANGELO: Whoa, whoa, whoa. How many poses have we done so far? -Is that all four of them? -Same one, babe. Inhale. That's just one? GARY: It's a combination of so many little things you had to, like, memorize it. -It's definitely harder than it looked. -[exhales] INSTRUCTOR: Pose number two is called Beer Chair pose. Slowly start to walk away from your partner. Take a sip. [exhales] And slowly, with control, start to walk back up. Okay, next one is Beer Boat. Feet against your partner's feet. Push, and bring it up. Grab your beer. Cheers. -[exhales] -His feet are awful. Last pose, Beer Dancer pose. Flick your right foot up. Grab the inside of your foot. Your left arm comes out in front of you. -Hold it here. Take a sip. -[exhaling] Come out of that. Beer is at heart center. -And that's the sequence. -Okay. We don't have it. Start from the top. Okay. Beer Salutation. WOMAN: Okay. Unscramble the letters. Uh... "U rare steak"? -[laughs] -Okay. Okay, here we go. All right, we're going. -MAN: Have fun. -Thank you. -Oh, my God. -[howls] -LEO: Oh! -ALANA: Come on, Leo! You have everything you need to succeed. Hopefully Leo can get it. It would suck if you had to go down that thing again. -Unscramble the letters. -I have the letters. So, T-A-K-U-R... Um, I'm sorry, this is so hard. This is a real stumbling block. Hopefully we can get out of here soon. -Hey. -APARNA: Okay, -so you got the letters... -Yeah, like, it's probably an English word with a German origin. I don't know. This is so hard. We just need to get it before the blondes get here. -I think we're lost. Awesome. -Andel's. Andel's Hotel. -Okay. Yes. -Awesome. Okay, so Haley and I just found the next place. LEO: There's no C-K. So the K has to go with something. -Yeah. -And I'm thinking K-R. -KAYLYNN: Okay, let's go. -HALEY: We can catch up. APARNA: The blondes-- oh, they're right there. -This is a height challenge. -Are you sure you can do this? -Yeah. I have to. -All right. All right. "Sauerkraut." -Oh. You're probably right. -Let me-- let me go first. -I'm gonna go first. Okay. -Okay, yeah, yeah. You guessed it. Go ahead. WOMAN: What's the word? I believe the word is sauerkraut. -Wow! That's it. -[whoops] -Yes! -Good job, good job. All right, we'll see you guys. -"Sauerkraut"? -Yes! Ah, finally. -HALEY: How was it? -Uh, it's-it's hard to answer the question. -Yeah. -So, what do I do, just look around for a clue? -Yeah. You'll see it. -Okay. Most of us had to do it more than once. -Okay, is it really scary up there? -APARNA: Good job. -LEO: I mean, it's high. -HALEY: Leo was like, "It's really hard, good luck, bye." All right. Now, you didn't help me, so I won't help you. -Good luck. -Leo, thank you. ALANA: Oh, my gosh, let's go. LEO: It was hard to not help Haley, but we didn't want to be in a race for last. And I wasn't gonna tell her, like, "Think about condiments." -We should do the sing-along. -Okay, we're doing the sing-along. -I think this might be easier. -I'm down-- Belt It Out? I don't even know what I'm doing. They said walking face-down a building. I could puke. Haley does not like heights. This probably should've been my Roadblock, but I did the last one. I am terrified right now. I really, really don't want to do this. -Danke. -MADDISON: Hey, guys. CHEE: Hey. Beard bros. -Right here. -HUNG: Here it is. CHEE: I see beer. I see beer. INSTRUCTOR: Welcome to beer yoga. Once you feel like you know the sequence, then you're welcome to leave, go downstairs and perform. GARY: We got other teams showing up. We're gonna try it. -Come on, D. -INSTRUCTOR: So, take a seat. Go feet to feet with your partner. Push, and up. -Oh, my leg. -You're cramping? No, my leg's too short. This is gonna be hard. Any beach volleyball player will tell you, like, they have tight hips. Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Yours are worse, though, than mine. -Whatever. INSTRUCTOR 2: You have your mats... -We're doing it. -...and your beers. GARY: All right. Start with Beer Salutations. Yes. The key is, you take a sip and after you take a sip, it's... [exhales] We're gonna start up first. -Reach back, forward. -DeANGELO: Whoa, whoa, Gary. Whoa, whoa. We were supposed to take a sip. Yeah. -We were supposed to take a sip. -GARY: All right, sorry. DeANGELO: Sorry, go back up. Unfortunately, you have to try again. GARY: Damn it, D. WILL: We're gonna try and sing. Hopefully we can memorize it really quick, perform and get our clue, but we're really good performers, so... There it is. Come on, babe. -Shall we? -Okay. [cheering, applause] WILL: Are you a teacher? -Yes. -Yes, we are. -You want to teach us? -Yes. -There are the costumes. -I'm gonna change. [Will laughs] JAMES: Oh, we're excited about our costumes. -WILL: We look good. -JAMES: So let's go learn. ♪ Ich wollt', ich war' ein Huhn♪ ♪ Ich hatt' nicht viel zu tun♪ ♪ Ich legte vormittags♪ ♪ Ein Ei und♪ ♪ Nachmittags war' ich...♪ JAMES: Learning the song was tricky. ♪ Ich legte♪ -♪ Vor...♪ -♪ Ich legte...♪ I could not get that "ich"-- how do you do it? -Ich?You know? -Ich. -Ich. Ich. -Ich. -Ich legte. -Yeah. -Hi. -What's your name? -My name's Haley. -Haley. Haley, hi. -Step in front. -Okay. MAN: Okay, you step down now. HALEY: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [whimpering] -I don't think I can do this. -Get all the way to the front. -I can't, I can't do this. -No, no, no. I can't do it. Oh, oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God. Okay. -Perfect. Start walking. -Okay. KAYLYNN: Go, Haley! [whoops] Oh, my God. S-A-K... "Sakur"? U-R, E-R, A-T-A-S-K-U-R. Oh, my God. Yeah, Haley! -Okay. -So, unscramble the letters. Oh, unscramble them. -Oh, my God, okay. -What's the word? A-S-K-U-R... KAYLYNN: I really hope that she can get this right so she doesn't have to do it again. I have no idea. -Okay. -I have to go again? Sorry. I... [sighs] GARY: And then you're gonna plant your heel. -Grab your beer. -DeANGELO: Grab your beer -with your right hand. -We're gonna come up... DeANGELO: We're gonna come up. GARY: ...into Warrior. And spread your arms. -Now this is the important part. Take a sip. -Take a sip. [exhales] -That's Beer Salutations. -Beer Salutations. Now you're gonna slowly walk out. Slowly walk it back up. That is Beer Chair. -Bring it up, together. -BOTH: Take a sip. [exhales] -And that is... -BOTH: Beer Boat. GARY: Bring up your right foot and grab the inside of your foot. Uh, white pants: inside, like this. There you go. And that's it. That is the whole routine. -Congratulations. -[whoops] Here's your next clue. "Race to Die Berkum and search for Phil on the mat at your next Pit Stop." Only one in four Berliners grew up in Berlin, and this is one of the places where expats unite: Neukolln. The last team to find me here on the street may be eliminated. -Thank y'all. -Yeah. -Good work, guys. -This is a Pit Stop next, guys. Okay, thank you. DeANGELO: Taxi! Now, the most important thing to German yoga is take a sip of your beer and go... [exhales] Okay, the first thing we're gonna do is S-Salutations. And you want to come into Plank. INSTRUCTOR 2: Okay, team. You need to work a little more on your verbal explanations. Okay. Yeah, yeah, let's go through it one more time. All right, thank you. We're gonna be doing four poses today. We're gonna start with Beer Salutation. Right hand to the back into Warrior Pose. We're gonna go into Downward Dog. Now we take a sip. [exhales] Next, the Beer Chair pose. Take a sip. [exhales] It did end up being, essentially, a memory challenge, and that's something I feel pretty confident in. So we decided that I would lead the class. And that is Beer Dancer. Congratulations. You've managed the challenge, you've taught the beer yoga class. Here's your next clue. Good luck with the rest of the race. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. APARNA: Okay, let's go Ballhaus Berlin. Thank you. SINGER: Good evening. -Pick one of us. -APARNA: Okay. You-- this one, 'cause you were so exuberant. -Okay. -Very excited about it. Hi, are you instructors? -Yeah. -We pick you. -Oh, thank you so much. -Great. "Aparna." Okay, cool. Coming in. Here I come. [clucking rhythmically] ♪ Ich wollt', ich war' ein Huhn♪ ♪ Ich hatt' nicht viel zu tun♪ ♪ Ich legte vormittags ein Ei und♪ ♪ Nachmittags war' ich frei♪ ♪ Mich lockte auf der Welt...♪ WILL: While we were singing, there were cue cards right in front of your face... JAMES: But it was so fast. ♪ La, la, la.♪ It was quite nice, but, uh, you can do better. -It's really fast. -Really fast, really fast. ♪ Kein Ruhm mehr und kein Geld...♪ -WILL: Hello, chickens. -ALANA: Hello. Don't we look incredible? -All right. -KAYLYNN: Go, Haley! Oh, my God. "Tar..." T-U-R... You have to get it on this try, Haley. Uh... Uh... S... I literally have no idea. Okay. Oh, my God, she's going back up. Oh, my God. [moans] So sick of going up these stairs. There's so many of them. [sighs] The first thing we're gonna do is Beer Salutation. When we taught it the first time, our terms weren't dialed in. RILEY: The second time we went back in, we were ready to go. Take a sip. [exhales] Next is Beer Chair. Gonna slowly step out. ...to a seating position. Now slowly step back up. Next, we're gonna go Beer Boat. And then we're gonna release our right hand. Take a sip. [exhales] This is called the Beer Dancer. Take a sip. [exhales] You made it. -Yes! -You managed the challenge. MADDISON: Go, let's go. -WILL: All right. -[piano playing] [clucking rhythmically] ♪ Ich wollt', ich war' ein Huhn♪ ♪ Ich hatt' nicht viel zu tun♪ ♪ Ich legte vormittags ein Ei und♪ JAMES: Although we had the words down, I think what really mattered was just selling the chicken outfit. And just putting on a bok-bok-bok performance. [laughs] ♪ Ich brauchte nie mehr in's Buro♪ ♪ Ich ware damlich♪ ♪ Aber froh♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la.♪ [laughter, applause] Yes, great. And I have a surprise for you. The clue. -[laughs]: Oh, my God! -[applause] -WILL: Thank you! -Thank you for letting us share the stage with you. Thank you. "Warning: the last team to check in may be eliminated." Do we wear the costumes to the Pit Stop? [laughter] All right. We got to find... There's the mat right there. Ah... You guys made it. All the world knows. All the world knows Berlin, the place to be. -Yeah. -KEOGHAN: So, I got good news. Firstly, you're team number one. -[laughs] -About time. About time. -Yes. Yes? -And secondly, you have won $7,500 each. -Okay. We'll take that. -Which you can enjoy after the race. Yes. We finally got our first place finish. -Yeah. We did. -We did everything right this time. DeANGELO: Yeah. We got a little help. -Uh, the alliance paid dividends today. -It did. -Good job, there. Very nice job. -Thanks, Phil. -You're making Berlin look good. -Thank you. KAYLYNN: You're doing great, Haley. Can't believe I can't do these words. This is my worst nightmare. It's just getting worse and worse and worse. I literally can't go back up those stairs. Please get it, please get it, please get it, please get it. T-A-K-E-S. R-U-R... U-A. Did you get it? -No. -You've got to get it, Haley. You're doing great, but we got to get it. Just don't know how everybody else figured it out but I can't. Like, that's the worst part. I don't know what to do, Kaylynn. -I don't know what to do. -That's okay, it's okay. -It's okay. -[crying] Come here. It's like, it just goes so quick. I know I can't give up, but, like, there's no chance. What do I do? I don't know what to do, Kaylynn. I just don't know what to do. I really don't. It's probably something you're just not thinking about, but it's, like, so basic. I've got the letters, in my head. Oh, I forgot them again. -Try it again. -Okay. HALEY: Unbelievable. CHEE: Let's go to the main street. HUNG: You think it's up this way? -Let's go. -Pit Stop. RILEY: There he is. On the right, on the right. Hey! -You made it, guys! -Yeah, we made it! KEOGHAN: So, Riley and Maddison, you're team number two. What? [laughs] CHEE: We took a wrong turn. I see Phil. Hi. KEOGHAN: Hung and Chee, you are team number three. I don't know if we've ever had a team with a clue stop racing and wait for another team -because of an alliance. -HUNG: It was not an ideal decision. But I gave my word and my word means everything. I will tell you this: the difference between first and third today is $15,000. Wow. CHEE: So, I think, you know, as we go along, you know, we'll provide help as much as we can, but we're not gonna stick around and just wait. Uh, I think that's something that we just don't have the margin for error to do in the future. So that's a lesson learned. -I see Phil! -[clucking] -Wow, look at you guys. -Yay! I am pleased to tell you that you are the first... -chickens to arrive at the mat. -[laughs] You are team number four. -Okay. -Okay. It's a lot, to, like, ask somebody, "Hey, can you help me unjumble these letters?" -You never know. -Yeah. You can do it. I know you can do it. HALEY: Thank you. Excuse me. So I'm playing a game. Would y'all be willing to help? Just, like, taking a couple guesses. -[moans] -You don't have to. No, that's okay. Okay. Feel better. It's okay. Can I ask you a question? Awesome. T-A-K-E-S-A-U-U-R-R. Okay. Is it an English word or a German word? I don't know. It could be either one. Um, I think it's a German word. Okay. Okay. I think it's "sauerkraut." Sauerkraut. Oh, my God. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. I-I think you're right. [laughs] Oh, my God. "Sauerkraut." "Sauerkraut." -"Sauerkraut"? -I think Haley got it this time. -[cheers] -Thank you so much. "Belt It Out or Belch It Out?" -We're gonna sing a German song. -Okay. -Let's go. Let's go, Haley. -All right. -Come on. -Okay. APARNA: Let's give it a try. Why not? [piano playing] ♪ Ich wollt', ich war' ein Huhn♪ ♪ Ich hatt' nicht viel zu tun♪ ♪ Ich legte vormittags♪ ♪ Ein Ei und nachmittags war' ich frei...♪ We just wanted to get out there and belt the song out. ♪ Ich brauchte nie♪ ♪ Mehr in's Buro♪ ♪ Ich ware damlich, aber froh♪ [clucking] ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la♪ ♪ La, la, la, la.♪ -APARNA: Yes! -Thank you! -Okay, let's go, let's go, let's go. -ESWAR: Okay.

Come on. -Come on. -Is that another team? We're in a race, so we got to get there as quick as possible. Now we have to go be chickens. Hi. WOMAN: There are the costumes. KAYLYNN: All right, we got to go change. ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la.♪ -Surprise, surprise, surprise. -[cheering, applause] ALANA: This is the most fun we've had all day.

ALANA: Thank you! ♪ Ich wollt', ich war' ein Huhn♪ ♪ Ich hatt' nicht viel zu tun♪ ♪ Ich legte vormittags ein Ei und♪ ♪ Nachmittags war' ich frei♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.♪ [cheering] -[applause] -Thank you. -Bye, thank you so much. -Thank you so much. -Okay, so now we need to get a taxi. -All right, so we need a taxi. -Eswar, come on. -ESWAR: Do you see a Pit Stop? APARNA: We got to get this. ALANA: Ready? Let's go. -[whooping] -KEOGHAN: More chickens. I see Phil. KEOGHAN: Here, there's a team here. Eswar and Aparna, you're team number five. -Okay. -Whew. Okay. And that would make you... BOTH: Team number six. And why is it a lovely number? 'Cause we're not eliminated. KAYLYNN: Can we ride with you? Thank you. [singing in German] I'm gonna say now, there's no way there's a team behind us. -No, there's not. Mm-mm. -There's not even a glimmer of hope. I'm just proud of us that we've done so much that we never, -ever, in this entire life thought we would ever get done. -Yeah. For sure. -All right. There's Phil. -Okay. -Hi. -KEOGHAN: They say it's fashionable to arrive late, but this is really getting ridiculous. -Three legs in a row. -It's insane. Your luck might have run out. -Yeah. Yeah, we figured. -We thought so. But it hasn't. This is a non-elimination leg... ...and you're still in the race. [both laughing] My God. For us to still be in the race... -Everything. -It-it means everything. HALEY: We are gonna come back and I know we can win. -Oh... -Pulled it out of our hat again. Captioning sponsored by CBS KEOGHAN: Still to come this season, with six legs left, tensions rise... Can't even look at you guys right now. DeANGELO: Whatever happened to sportsmanship? KEOGHAN: ...as teams do whatever it takes... This is the time to use it. Do it! You want to stay in the race! KEOGHAN: ...to win it all. We're gonna try to work smart and fast. Open wide. KEOGHAN: 11 countries, 17 cities, more than 33,000 miles, you have won the $1 million and... The Amazing Race.
