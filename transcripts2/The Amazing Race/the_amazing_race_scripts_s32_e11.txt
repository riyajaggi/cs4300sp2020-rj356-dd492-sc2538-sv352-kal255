 Previously, on "The Amazing Race"... - All right, let's do it! - ...five teams raced to Siem Reap, Cambodia. Just going upstream to a temple. Standard Thursday. With only the Mine Five alliance left in the game, some teams were in the dark... It's every team for themselves. ...about a secret alliance with a U-Turn plan. There's only one real alliance. Us, the boyfriends,

 - and Chee and Hung. - We're all on the same page that we need to get Gary and Deangelo out of the race. When that plan fell apart... If we U-turn Deangelo and them, they could U-turn Chee-Hu or the boyfriends. ...a new target was found... We're gonna U-turn brother and sister. ...setting up a tense confrontation at the Roadblock. Why would you not use your brain to U-turn a team that's, like, been ahead of you? If I'd have U-turned any other team, I'd be last. In the end, Riley and Maddison won the leg...

 - You are team number one. - Good work, man! ...while Eswar and Aparna couldn't complete a U-Turn comeback. I'm sorry to tell you, you have been eliminated from the race. Coming up tonight, the final four become the final three. - You can't let them pass us! - Hi-o! Who will make it in? - And who will be eliminated... - Come on, Gary. ...next? Let's go, alliance! Shh! Secret. After finishing first in Cambodia, Riley and Maddison won a trip from Travelocity - to Norway. - Holy moly. We're going to Bergen, Norway. - Are you kidding me? - Yeah! Five nights! This is legit. Our beards are gonna fit right in. Wow. This is the hotel? - Wow, look at that. - Look at this place. We're gonna be living it up. - Nice. We're stoked. - Yes! - Where we going? - "Fly to Manila in the Philippines." Riley and Maddison will be the first of the final four teams to fly to Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, one of the first countries to adopt texting, and now known as the texting capital of the world. Teams must find me here, downtown, at Lapu Lapu Circle. - Let's do it. - All right. Final four feels real good. We've won two legs in a row. So, I guess you'd say we're-we're peaking, but I don't want to jinx it. Kind of a strange clue, though, because it says you'll find, like, a marked jeep - that will take you to Phil. - Right. Normally you only see Phil at the end, at the Pit Stop, and this time, we're seeing him almost at the Pit Start. Something strange is gonna happen. The Philippines! We love the Philippines! Mabuhay. Let's go. Lapu Lapu Circle, here we come. To make the final three would be a dream come true. To get to the very end would be amazing. Unintended. It would be great if Gary and Deangelo have a big fall-out today, and get eliminated. We love our alliance with Hung and Chee and the beards. But at this point, we really need to focus on Will and James. As long as Will and James get to the final three, that's all we care about. - All right, let's go. - Let's go. It would be just a huge sense of satisfaction to make it to the final leg. Hung and I want to do this to be good role models for our daughters, you know, and show them what, you know, grit and determination looks like. Never been to the Philippines before. Um, my best friend is half Filipino, so hopefully this is a good sign. All right, let's go. Winning's our nature. It's what we're taught to do growing up, it's what we were taught when we're playing. We don't want participation trophies. We only want to win. If we don't win, then we're not satisfied. At this point, no one's helping anyone, because it could cost you a trip into the... The final three. ...the final three. Hey, what's up, guys? Okay, I see Will and James and beard brothers. Yay! Guys, the alliance is complete. Yeah, this feels good. Hopefully, there'll be a dance challenge or something Deangelo and Gary can't do. Hopefully they'll go. - There they are. - Yeah. - Can we, uh...? - Let's check in now. Oh, let's check in. Go ahead, guys. Hey, guys. - Hello. - Hello. We are on our way to the Philippines. And we're all on one flight. Our only goal now is to get to the final three. Gonna be another team out there, whether it's the beard bros or the boyfriends or Chee-Hu, that are going home. Boarding our flight to Manila! - Final four, baby. - What he said. It's about to be The Thrilla in Manila, Part 2. Lapu Lapu Circle. Right there, he's right there. Oh, I see him with his hat. It's extremely weird to see Phil at the beginning of a leg. Hi, everybody. We knew that something different was gonna happen. And everybody was on pins and needles. Welcome to downtown Manila, the most densely populated city center in the world. Now, you're probably wondering why I've got you here. That's because, for the first time ever, you're about to take part in a city sprint. You are gonna be racing around Manila, through all this dense, crazy traffic, as fast as you can. Holy smokes. There are no Roadblocks and no Detours. You'll do every challenge as a team and speed matters the most. You're gonna race all around the city and then guess where you're coming back to. - Here. - Right here. Right here. This is the start of this leg of the race and it's also the Pit Stop for this leg of the race. So, I know that there's been some alliances. I know that, throughout the race, you've all helped each other out, but if I could give you any advice, think very carefully about helping out another team, because this is all or nothing for all of you. If you want to be in that final three, you got to do what you can to stay in it. Is everybody ready to race? - Yeah! - Yes! All right, now your first clue is inside one of the marked jeepneys which is close by. When I give you the word, you can run to that marked jeepney, grab your clue, read it, and start your sprint around Manila. Good luck. Travel safe. - Run, run. - Let's get it, let's go. Come on, Chee. Chee, come on. - Come on, babe. - Yo, I don't know - if it's this way. - Hello. Hi! - Keep running. - There they are. Will, Will, come here! Right here. - Just get in one. Right here. - Go, baby. Right there, to the left. Do you see it, Chee? Here we go. "Solve this riddle to find the marked clue giver." "But keep your eyes peeled while you're on the road." "Red means stop, green means go." "When it comes to traffic, I make it flow." "Hold out your hand to grab your clue. Then you'll find out what's waiting for you." The navigation company Waze once called this the worst traffic on Earth. The perfect recipe for road rage. Thankfully, Romero Hinojas has come to the rescue, by putting a smile on everyone's faces with entertaining moves like these. Teams need to find him, grab a clue, and then keep on racing. - Get ready to have your hand out. - Yes. The marked jeepney knew where to go. We just need to keep our eyes open. "Hold out your hand and grab your clue." "Red means stop, green means go. When it comes to traffic, I make it flow." So it's either a traffic light or a policeman. Damn, we are stuck in some traffic. In Manila, there is an insane amount of traffic, which is alarming because you know that that's gonna play a part in the race. Traffic going in every single direction, multiple ways. Go, go, go! - What the hell? - Move! Shoot, we just got passed up by everybody. Go! Go to the side, please! You got to stick your arm out to get the clue. - Yeah, I know, I saw that. - So get ready. Get your arm ready. 'Cause it could be on your side. We're not even at a light. There's a light right here. I'm just saying, you got to look. I'm just gonna have my arm out the whole time. If you pass the clue, you're in trouble. Definitely one of those things where it helps to be with the pack and not too far ahead. - It's cutthroat now. - Yeah. Riley, is this the guy? Did you see the traffic cop that we need to get the clue from? - Yeah. - Oh, here, here, here! Riley, Riley, Riley! On your side. Yo! Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Here! Here! Come here! Thank you. - We crushed it. - Let's do this. "Tell your driver to take you to Mall of Asia." - Mall of Asia! - Hey! - Right there. - Hey! - Right there, right there. - Oh, right here. Oh! Sir, sir! Sir, over here! Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Sweet. Thank you. - We're going to Mall of Asia. - Sir, sir! Sir, sir! - Sir, sir, sir! - Sir! It was definitely morning traffic. When we eventually found the police officer, our jeepney turned sharply, so we couldn't get the clue. And so, we had to circle back around. Do we have to circle back around? Can we go back? - Slow it down. Slow, slow, slow. - Slow, slow. - Slow, slow, slow. - Slow, slow, slow. - Put your hand out, Will. - Slow, slow, slow. The traffic was a nightmare. It's kind of a crapshoot at that point. It's really luck of the draw. No, no, no, no, no, no! Come back, come back. Come here, sir! - Sir! Sir! Sir! - Sir! Sir! Come here, please! Are you joking me? Hung and Chee didn't get theirs, either. Did James and Will get it, or did they miss it? Looks like they didn't get it. They've got to circle back, too. That's so annoying. Go back to that intersection! - That's so messed up! - Turn around! - That is ridiculous. - I had my hand out. Your hand was out! Yes, James! Be quiet. Can we go back? Go back to that intersection, please! Thank you, thank you, thank you. - Hung and Chee are behind us. - Thank God. - Slow it down. Slow. - Slow, slow. - Slow, slow, slow. - Slow, slow, slow, slow. - Put your hand out, Will. - Slow, slow, slow, slow. I got it. I got it, I got it. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Come on, come on. - Okay, we're approaching, okay, Hung? Yes. Do you see him? I don't see him. He's on the right! On my side, Hung. On my side. Get on my side. Get on my side. Let's go. Hello, hello, hello, hello! - Hello. - Ah! - Thank you! - Thank you! Mall of Asia. - Yeah? Over there. - Yeah, this is good. Let's do this! - That way. - All right, let's go. - Let's go, Riley. - Whew. - "Run a race at a fast pace. In high-heeled pumps, don't fall on your face." Marikina is home to a thriving shoe-making industry, as well as the world's largest pair of shoes, earning the nickname "The Shoe Capital of the Philippines." It's also home to an annual running race unlike any other on the planet. It's a great way to test the durability of these high-heeled pumps. Let's hope no one breaks an ankle as they try to complete the course in these stylish stilettos. "Make your way to the starting line. "When signaled, run the marked course and cross the finish line." Oh, my God, you're kidding me. - Let's put our shoes on. - Oh, geez. I don't want to sprain my ankle in these things. We're putting on these beautiful high heels. Good thing I'm used to wearing these every Friday night. This is the bay. So it should be on this somewhere. Did they beat us here? Feeling real sexy. Ridiculous. Oh, no, no, no. - They-they just showed up. - Let's do it. Okay, let's go. Ready? - Run on your toes. Oh, God. - Yeah, toes. We had to do a 500-meter dash with other people wearing high heels. The running was less than comfortable. We had to run on our tippy toes the whole time. Well, Riley's like, "Yo, run on your toes." I was like, - "You can't." - This is absurd. "Run a race at a fast pace. In high-heeled pumps." Hell no. I got to run in high heels. This is a new one for me. It's a new one for both of us. Be careful, yeah? I just really didn't want to get hurt, because I got, you know, nice, skinny, fragile ankles. And one little tweak, and that's... That's game over for us. You know what? I'm-a have fun. The zipper's not going up. Just keep breathing. Let's go, baby. Come on! I have ran my share of 40s. I've never ran 'em in heels, though. - It's ridiculous. - This is awful, bro. Come on. You ready? Come on, Gary, come on. I'm not used to this, man. Fight through the pain. Let's go. Oh, this sucks. Ow. Looking good, guys. - This sucks so bad. - Yeah. - Come on, Gary. - I'm coming. I want to beat this guy. - This is it? - They've already started, James. Holy smokes. Oh, this sucks bad. Gary and Deangelo running in high heels, that's something I never thought I would ever see in my lifetime. Oh, my God, it was so good. Gary, you're killing me, bro. - I'm running! - Oh, my God, we get to walk in heels. Thank you. Go, go, go! Yeah, keep going straight, Hung, keep going straight. Hold on. Wait for me. Yay! - Nice. - All right. I don't know how women wear heels, let alone run in them. "Make your way to Binondo. "Search the streets for lions. "Reach into their bite, they won't put up a fight. You'll get your next clue if you're all right." This is an entrance to Binondo, the oldest Chinatown in the world. It's customary for businesses to invite dancing lions like this in for a visit, with the hope of bringing them good luck and prosperity. Teams must now search among the lions on these congested streets and find one with a clue in its mouth. "Enter Binondo through the Arch of Goodwill." Let's get a taxi, Riley. Oh, my God. I am so uncomfortable. I got to walk. Come on, Gary. We're almost there, bro. - Yes! - Running in heels is up our alley. - We can do this in our sleep. - I own a pair of high heels. Who owns a pair of heels? I do. But mine are six inches. So these were, like, kitten heels. Like, little two-inch little baby heels. This is funny. I'd never run in high heels before, so I was a little bit antsy about that. You've never run in high heels? I've "walked" around in heels, - but I'd never ran in heels. - Okay. - Okay, ready, Hung? - Yeah. All right. Are you ready? - Ready. - Go! - Ready? - Yeah! - Go! - - Go. - Babe, be careful. - Come on, babe! We got it. - Go, Chee, just go. - I'm going as fast as I can. - Okay. - Okay. We actually caught up with Hung and Chee while running in the heels. Oh, my God. Come on, Will. And more importantly, - we looked good while doing it. - Yeah. - Look at James. - This is so fun. It's a little bit painful. Almost there, Hung. Yes! Come on, babe. Oh! Babe, you are awesome. - Good job, Chee. - Yeah. I think we're in first, but by nothing. The traffic is so incredibly difficult that everyone has time to catch up. We're looking for the Arch of Goodwill. We're in a race. Sweet. - Oh, there's one right there. - Where? There's one right there. The-the lions right there. Ah, is that a lion? Can you get your hand in there? - Nothing. - There's nothing in there. It could be these dragons right here, D. No, it's not in there. Are they dragons or are they lions? Lions. Is this a lion? - I don't know... - Should I put it in his mouth? - Put it in his mouth? - Go ahead. Stick your hand in there. - Nah, you can't. - Hey, hey, hey. This is what they do. - Oh. - He's trying to, like, see. We'll just see. No? All right, let's go. Come on, go, go, go, go. - Come on, Gary! - Let's go, let's go. Come on, let's go. We got to hurry up, we got to hurry up. - See. - You're taking your time. - Okay. - Hurry up. - Come on, D. Hurry up. - Huh? - Hurry up! - I'm hurrying. - Oh. No. - No. Okay. Is that the Arch of Goodwill? Yes, it is. - All right. - We're gonna get out right here. This might be it. - Got it. - That it? - This is it? - Come on, come on, come on. "To the Central Post Office. On foot you must go." Central Post Office. Come on, Gary. - Hey, guys. - Hey, guys. Hey. Will, there's a lion. Hello, lion. - Come on, Will. - Maybe if I put my hand - in the mouth. No? - Come on, Will. What the hell is going on? That one doesn't have one. Okay. Do you have a clue for us? Do you have a clue for us? - What the hell? - Do you have a clue? No. No? Will, there's another one down here. Yes! There it is! Yay! Go, go. Do we want to ask someone? The archway, Riley. Oh, there-there's Deangelo and them. - Let's go, Gary. - Let's go the other way. Let's keep going down. - Want to keep running down? - Sure. I don't know what else to do. - Arch of Goodwill? Right here? - This? Oh. Okay. So where are the lions? David, where are the lions? That's the only arch? You don't know where the lions are? Should we, uh, stop and get out now? Yeah. Thank you. Okay, let's go, let's go. Let's go. Do you know where the Chinese lions are? Chinese lion statues? No? Where are the lions? Well, maybe it's this fountain. - That way? - Okay, no-no lions. Come on. No? No? Let's keep going, Riley. We're going the right direction. Right here. Riley, here we go. Go. Oh. Yeah! It's a bit of a crapshoot. I don't, I don't see anything. I don't see any lion heads over there. - Maybe it's on the bridge? - Lions? - We need help. - Can't find one. - Where? - To the Arch of Goodwill. No, Chee! No. Look that way, Chee. I don't see any lion heads over there. We're in trouble. We're behind. - Come on. Okay. - Want me to ask these police officers? Hello. We're looking for a statue of the Chinese lions. Dragon lions? Like, like, they look like this. Yeah. Wh-Where? Oh, there's no here? Anywhere close by? Lion statues? - I'm sorry. This way? - This way? - Okay. - Thank you. Let's go. Go, go. This looks like this could be a post office. Oh, there go the box right there. I see it. "Go into the square, you'll find horses there. Prepare their feed, it's just what they need." This is Manila Central Post Office, where teams must find these kalesas, horse-drawn carriages that were introduced by Spanish colonizers in the 18th century. After choosing a horse, teams must feed it. They'll need to search the grounds for the necessary ingredients and then mix them together. Once they've served it up, they'll get a clue. Square right here, straight ahead. Come on, let's go! Right here? "Use the bucket located on the carriage." Okay. So we got to find vendors that have our ingredients, around this plaza. Then we have to mix them later. - You see anything? - I don't know. That's one right there. Come on. Come on. Gary, right here. - First one. - Thank you! We're in first place, but trying to find the other ones now. We got to find two more. "Route Info." Holy crap. More. "Choose a marked horse and carriage." - Go, go, go. - Will, just pick this one. "Use the provided bucket located in the carriage." Right here. - That looks like poop. - Oh. The bucket underneath. - There you go. - Okay, go. That way. Here! - Pour it in here? - This looks so good. I can't wait to not eat this. - Good? - We're good? Thank you. Let's go this way. Go around, to the right. You see anything over there? - No. - Gary. Let's go over here. - You see anything? - I'm looking. No. - Nothing. - Gary, what are we not seeing? It's not gonna be here. No, no. Come on. Let's go across the way. Go back over, D? - Post office? - We got it, Riley. Let's go! Go, go, go, go, go. There it is, Chee! Lions. - Lions right there. - I know, I just said that, Chee! - I'm sorry. - Come this way. Please, please, please, please. - Clue? Clue, please? - Please. - Clue? Clue? - Clue, please? Clue? Clue? Clue? No? Clue? No? No clue? Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. This is ridiculous. Where is it? - Here, Hung, here. - Oh, here, here. All right, let's do this. Be aggressive. In his mouth! Oh, my gosh! - Central Post Office. - Central Post Office. Let's go! Hello! We put this in the bucket? Yeah. Or do we... we put it in there? - Thank you. - Thank you. - Boyfriends are here now. - Oh. - The end up catching up with us. - I got one. - Right there. Right there! - Where? Oh, we missed that. Damn! Hi. Thank... oh... - We'll take that one. - "Return to your horse - and mix them together." - Put it in there. - We need to go back. - Let's go. One more. - There's grass somewhere. - Grass is somewhere. Hey, where are these buckets at? Are they on the back? - Mix it together? - It says "Everything except the grass." - Oh, it's in here. - Oh. "The marked vendors have your ingredients." Okay, let's go. This way first? Over there. - Hello. - Marked vendors? Yeah. - I got it. - Okay, let's go. What's the next one? - Delicious. - I'm not doing it. I'm so happy I'm not doing that. Yum, yum, yum. Eat, enjoy it. We passed Gary and Deangelo and Maddison and Riley. They left the heel-running before we did and we're here first and feeding our horse first. Good boy. - Here. - Thank you. - That's two, yeah? - One more. Aw. Thank you! "Mehan Garden is having a rock show. Travel here to get your next clue." "Travel on foot." More running. Holy crap. - We got it. Yes. - We're in first place. - Let's go back. One, two, three? - Hold up. This way? - We got three. Gary. - Take it. - Come on. - Come on. - I got it. - All right, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't spill it, yeah? - "Mix all your ingredients," besides the grass. - Yeah. - Here we go. Ready? - Okay. All right, awesome. Riley, grab it. - Yeah, go, go, go. - Mehan Garden? Mehan Garden? Damn it, Gar. Good? We done? Take it, D. Take it, D. Take it, D. - Thank you. Come on. - This way. Will, I don't know - how we're gonna cross. - Thank you, thank you! Salamat. Geez Louise. I think it's right here. How cool. Look at this music box. Ready? Listen to the band play a medley of songs you've heard on the race. This is the final and most difficult challenge that teams will face before checking into the Pit Stop. Teams must identify four pieces of music that they've heard during the race. They must find four instrument cases identified with a national flag representing the four countries that they've heard the songs in. Teams will hear the songs played in a particular order, but they'll have to present their boxes in the order they heard those songs on the race to get their next clue. We got this. Hold on. "Search through the cases - loaded in the marked vehicle." - Right there. - Go. - Hurry up. - Let's keep our lead. - Is this it? Riley. They're right there. "Match the flag on each side of each case - in order of location they were played on the race." - Okay. This is Colombia. No, that's not Colombia. The beards are here. Let's go, let's go. Do you guys know where Chee and Hung are? - I don't know. - No clue? We're ahead of Deangelo and Gary. Yeah, Deangelo and Gary are not here. What did Trinidad and Tobago look like? It might be "Day-O," right? - Will, I got it. - What are we taking, dude? "Match the flag on the side of each case "in the order of the location they were played in on the race." - Oh. - Wow. The boyfriends and the beard bros are here. - Wait, listen, listen. - There's only four songs. Think about all the places that had music. Did we hear music in India? What is this from? There was a marked truck that had all these cases for a rock band, but on each case was a flag. - That was... Riley, that was Bogotá. - I know. Colombia. I know. That a way, Riley! Yes! The flags in the truck represented where we had heard the songs along the race. And so, we were supposed to match the songs that they're playing with the places that we visited on the race. There were some songs that we knew and there were some songs that we didn't, so it made it really challenging. - Listen to it, Gary. - I am. - No clue. - This is Trinidad? That is for sure Trinidad. Just bring these four and go. I don't even remember hearing these songs. - Let's do it. - No, wait, wait, wait. - This is three and four. - Let's go. I like your sunglasses. No. I'm sorry. - It's okay. Thank you. - Yeah. Come on. Let's just take them over there. We don't know if it's even these! I think we're right. Wow. Incorrect. Head back to the truck. - Yep. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Do you think it's the order, Riley? - Yeah, yeah. - Four is Paraguay. No, four is Trinidad. - Quiet. We got to line them up in the order that they play it. Over there? Thank you. Chee, over here. - One more. - You see it? Yeah, right there. Go, go, go, go, go Hi. - Let's go. - Okay. I'm gonna mix it. As fast as you can. - I can hold it, Hung. - Okay. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on, come on, come on. I think we're in last place right now, so hopefully we can make up time at the next task. The band over there is playing a medley of tunes that we heard on the race. And we have to match up these boxes that have flags on them in the order that they play them. It's Bogotá, Colombia is the second one. I think Berlin is the first one. We're just trying to remember all the countries that we went to. Let's just go try one. Let's just go try. Four. We just did a little reorder. Hopefully that's right. Still wrong? Yeah. Thank you. How did we not get that? Hey, you guys want to work together? No. Sorry, no. - Okay. - Gary and Deangelo yelled out, "Do y'all want to work together?" and I said no. We knew all the flags, so I felt confident that we could do it. It's not Kazakhstan. Where else played music? Paraguay? We got it. I don't know, dude. It's incorrect. Really? All right, I-let's go back to the drawing board. Every one of us guessing. Come on. This is very tough, man. - Please. - Come on. That is incorrect. This is tough. - Right here. - Here, here, here, here. Oh, there goes Chee-Hu, bro. There's... Chee-Hu just showed up. That's fine. Every team's struggling with this. "Match the flag on the side of each case in the order of location they were played on the race." - We can catch up here, Chee. - Okay, so we're just gonna - grab flags? - Yeah. Kazakhstan, Colombia, Cambodia. We need these, uh... This is nuts. I don't know. Whatever. We got nothing. - Let's go. - What do you think? I-I'm drawing a complete blank. We should just work together. This is the first time we heard the medley. Yeah, we don't even know what songs they are. - We didn't even hear the songs yet. - Oh. Stop, D. Nobody's gonna help anybody. - Hey, guys. - Y'all, this is tricky. This is brutal, dude. - This is gonna be a while. - My feet are raw from running. No. - You're pretty sure on those three? - Nope. I'm not sure on any of them. We know all the flags, we just don't know the songs. - Oh, come on, Hung. Let's go. - Maddison. This is really dumb. We're literally guessing. - Nope. - Okay. I don't feel like anyone's gonna get this. It's not the right answer. You'll have to do better than that. It's a big no. - Try again. - This is unreal. I don't know what we're doing wrong. Worst game ever. This is stupid. Trinidad, we know that one's for sure. Colombia, we know that one is for sure. Come on, D. All we can do is keep trying. This is brutal, bro. God. Incorrect. This is unreal. I really, like, I'm stumped. Let's go talk to Hung and Chee and them. We kept trying every single flag that we've ever been to on the race and we kept doing it over and over and over, but everything that we tried was wrong. And it was very frustrating. What do you guys think for the songs? Colombia and Trinidad are locks. - Yes, that... for sure. - Two and four. Two and four are the obvious ones. One and three are not easy. Once we realized how hard this was going to be, we decided that we had to work with our alliance. We had to. Guys, it doesn't matter who wins this leg of the race. If us six put our heads together to solve this problem, we're all gonna advance. It was at that point where our light bulbs turned on. We have a shot at being the final three. All we have to do is help each other and not give this information to Gary and Deangelo. One, two, three, four, okay? Two is Colombia, four is Trinidad. We need to crank out my list. That way we don't think and we just crank them out. Since we're confident in two, we only have to do, like, - 15 permutations. - Yeah. You try one, we try one, and then whoever gets it, walk off and then come around and tell us. We're just gonna have to drill this out. We haven't done Kazakhstan and France. How about we... Hung and I try that? - Yeah. Don't say it in front of them, yeah? - Okay. Need to go back to the truck. - Ugh... - I don't know what to tell you, D. First Kazakhstan, France third. Come on, Chee. - Stop talking, Riley. - I know. - Come on, Chee. - Hold on, hold on. We were sure that the second song played was from Colombia and the fourth song played was "Day-O," the Trinidad and Tobago song. One and three we were unsure of, so we had written out every single permutation possible... Still not the right answer. ...keeping Colombia and Trinidad and Tobago in those two slots. We're just going down the list. You guys can do France and Germany now. France and Germany as one and three? Yeah, one and three. So the game plan was, we would try one, cross it off, and then Chee and Hung would try one and cross it off and then the boyfriends would try one and cross it off until we finally happened to stumble upon the right combination. They're doing a lot of whispering, bro. Guys, we're halfway done. Do Paraguay, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Trinidad. Damn it, Gary. They are helping each other, bro. There was a lot of people talking to people and obviously that alliance is broken and the gloves have come off. That was, that was a surprise, but we just keep true to our word and some people don't. The alliance is over. It's off. Obviously. Oh, my God. I think we're done. They all three banded together to eliminate us. That sucks, dude. We got to go, Gary. We got to go. They didn't stick to their word. They're all scared of us. This is bad, bro. We need France and Paraguay. - Okay. - We're almost done with the list. Gary, this may be it. We need to get out of here. No. Uh, no. - Incorrect. - Okay. You did Kazakhstan and Germany? - Yeah. - Okay. Kazakhstan and Paraguay. - Last one. We're gonna get it. - Okay. If this doesn't work, then I don't know. Bro, this is awful, bro. This is awful. If they get it, we're done. - Did they get it? - Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Try again. - Damn it, dude. - No, it's wrong. - We're out of all the other permutations. - Are we doing this right? - Come on, Gary. We got to move. - Guys, I don't know. We did, we did every possible variation. - That's why I'm confused. - This is so defeating. This is unbelievable. Um, I don't know. Maybe there's something we were missing. Are... I mean, Tobago's for sure. What-what if Colombia's wrong? The carnival song. - You know... - That's Colombia for sure. - It was the-the tightrope. - I know, I know. - That was the tightrope. - I know, but I'm just, like, trying to think of something else, 'cause, what, are we done? - What? - We're gonna try Brazil. We got to add, like, India in here? We're just trying now. Trial and error. At this point, we should just throw some Hail Marys. Just take one out blindly, take another one out and just do it. There's four songs playing. We know two and four. One and three, nobody has any idea what they are. None. We're just trying stuff now. We're just grabbing and plugging and playing. I don't think anybody has any clue. No clue. We'll probably be here till dark. - No, it's the wrong answer. - Dang. I'm so confused. Something is wrong. I think we went through every single combination before I just said, "Hey, let's go read our clue." Read your clue. Classic. - Oh, my God. - So I pulled out the clue and I read, "Put everything in the order that you heard it on the race," not that you're hearing it here, and light bulb goes off. I reread the clue. It's not the order that the medley's been playing... The order that we heard it. We just read it. Exact same time, Hung and Chee read their clue, too, and so we had another collaboration moment of, like, "Y'all, we're doing this wrong." It's not the order that they're playing it now, it's the order that it was in the race, so Trinidad one, Colombia two. And then we need to do the other, the other two. That's the unlock, guys. Wow. Trinidad and Colombia one and two. We got it? That is correct. Yeah, baby. - All right. - Did they get it? - They got it. - Beard bros just got it. Yeah, they got it. "Make your way to where it's at, back to where you saw Phil but now there's a mat, it's as easy as that." Good job, guys. - James, come here. - He's coming. - Chee, he's coming. - Go. Go, go, go. It's-it's-it's, um, it's the first two, - so it's, uh... - Trinidad, Colombia. T-Trinidad and Colombia, and then Paraguay, France. - Hey, just remember: do not let them see. - Okay. He just told them. He just told them all. - Are you serious? - Where do we go? Lapu Lapu Circle. - It's that big statue. - Run! Yes! - That sucks. - We're done. Once they get it, we're done. We'll just take the penalty. We're not gonna figure it out. Well, well, we out of here, Gary. That is correct. - Thank you, thank you. - Thank you. Salamat po. Okay, come on. - Go, babe. - How far is that? - Like, half a mile. - Come on. Wow. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. - Finally. - Okay, let's go. - We're done. - There's no point in us trying. We saw the beard bros run up there and help the other two teams, and then they both ran by us and didn't say a word, which is whatever. It's like, there's nothing we can do about it. We knew we weren't gonna figure it out. We had no idea what it was, so... We just took the two-hour penalty. I told you they was doing a lot of whispering. That alliance has been going on since leg two. We worked together, we trusted each other. Right. And then that came back to bite us in the ass here in this last leg, but... At the end of this race, there's gonna be one team happy. - Correct. - Ten teams are gonna be pissed, and it's gonna be interesting, because they can't work together as a group of three when this million dollars is up. Get ready to take a nap. - Oh, right here, Riley. - Yeah. Done, baby. Welcome to Manila, the Philippines. Thank you so much. Riley and Maddison... ...you are team number one. - Yes, baby! - Congratulations. You are one of the three teams who will be racing to the finish line for $1 million. Yes. We're going to the finals, baby. Maddison and I are peaking right now. We've won the past three legs of the race, and I think we're gonna win it. An amazing leg, guys. - Thank you. - But you did help out another team. Well, we wouldn't have gotten that last one if it wasn't for Hung to point out the clue. So we had to help them. Okay, it looks like we have another team coming in. Who's it gonna be? Stay right where you are. The boyfriends. Come on, baby. Ah, we frickin' did it! We did it. - Baby. - Guys, we did it, baby. - Will and James... - Yes. ...you are one of the three teams that will be racing to the finish line for $1 million. We've worked so hard the entire race to get here. Being in the final three just further reaffirms the fact that we make a great team. We have laid the foundation of love from start till now, and I'm just so excited we get to do it together. - I love you. - I love you. Okay, let's go. Come on. Come on, guys! Come on, Hung and Chee, come on! Yes! Tunnel. Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel, tunnel, tunnel. Yes! Oh, God! - Oh, my God. - Bring it in, baby. - This feels so good. - We did it. We did it. Hung and Chee, you are standing with the final three teams... ...that will be racing... Yes! We're actually in the finals, like, it's so mind-blowingly unreal. It was very important for all of you guys to be here in this moment going into the final leg. We chose Maddison and Riley and Will and James for a reason. We felt like they were very trustworthy people, um, who would compete hard and because they're a strong team, they would help all of us get to the final leg of the race. So how about I tell you where you're going to next? - Yes. - You're flying back to the United States, and you are going to New Orleans. The Big Easy. And I have some more great news for you. You guys will be getting an upgrade on the way home. - So you can travel... - So good. ...with a little more comfort. But I'm just wondering how all of this is gonna work out when you're racing against each other. - May the best team win. - Yes. - Exactly. - It's gonna be a lot of love and admiration and respect. Our favorite games are playing our best friends. - Yeah. - So that's what this is, and it's gonna be an epic battle. Yes. That's so true. We did it. All according to plan. - All according to plan. - Are you kidding me? - How does that happen? - We're like masterminds. And there is one team missing. Thank God. Let's go, Gary. Oh, man. Deangelo and Gary, you did not complete the last challenge, and unfortunately, you have been eliminated from the race. Any regrets about coming on the race? Yes. The race sucked. The bad outweighed the good. I'd never come back on the show again. Like, the money wasn't life-changing for me. Right, but you didn't enjoy the experience? Well, I could've paid for it myself and not had to race - around the world. - I did. I enjoyed it. - I'll-I'll cross him out. - Yeah. I enjoyed it. I had a blast. I had so much fun. Got to go to a bunch of countries I probably wouldn't have ever gone to on my own. I hope, maybe one day, Deangelo, if you look back, you'll remember a few more good things than bad things. - He will. I'll... When we talk about it... - No. ...he'll talk about a lot of what we did. Gary was a solid partner. At first, me and D, we were rocky 'cause we had never competed where it was just us two, - but we got better and better, and... - Yeah. I wouldn't have had another partner. - Appreciate it. - The other teams, they didn't want to face us in the finals. The only one that's been pushing them was us. They don't have that threat anymore. Now they can't work together. Alliance is no more. - But we're okay with that. - Mwah. Deliver it! Delivered! I delivered it! The alliance totally served its purpose, but now that we're in the finals, it's where the gloves come off. It's the final three. Everybody is on their own. I don't think any of us are gonna be helping each other. We're just gonna continue to race as hard as we can. Oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my God! The money would be fantastic. We have three kids. They need to go to college. Let's go, Hung. Winning the race will only prove that we are ready for that next step together. And after this, we can get engaged and start planning a wedding. - Do it. - Yes! We have a really good shot at winning. We're gonna win in the final. We're gonna race our ass off in this final leg. We are gonna win The Amazing Race. No question about it. We got this. Captioning sponsored by CBS Next time on the season finale of The Amazing Race... We're not gonna die. ...alliances are done... Now it's about winning. ...as teams race through the Big Easy... - Go, go, go. - It's called Fat Tuesday for a reason. ...to win the $1 million prize... - May the best team win. - Come on! - Bring it. - ...andThe Amazing Race.
