 The teams will catch a train travel as quick as we can. The teams will catch a train travel as quick as we can. This is our fourth time in a Row leaving in first place but. We have really spent time Building relationships with the. Other teams so that teams don't Target us going forward and. Hopefully we'll make it to the Final three for the second time. We have $88 for this leg of The race. Tandem bike? I have one at home. Will you look up something on Your phone for us. Reeva travel. We are the only non-race team Left. We want first place at least Once. The takeaway from last leg Was never give up. We thought we were out of it. Always have hope. Energy and confidence is through The roof. We're trying to get to Amsterdam as fast as possible. Where's tyler and korey? Where did you guys go? He said it was far. We need two tickets. If we can do the same flight They did. We just got our tickets to Amsterdam. On the first flight out of here. It's time to split! Netherlands! Let's go. This leg of of "The amazing Race" is a milestone for us. Leg 10 is a great way for us To demonstrate our growth as a. Team. We're learning that we're Very different people that get. Along really well and when we Mesh that, things go really. Well. Bicycles don't unlock until 9:00 a.M. starting from the same place. Riva travel. It's just right there. I've always wanted to go to Amsterdam. We know we're the strongest Team. We aren't been performing at the Strongest level the last eight, Nine legs. It's not a good feeling being Towards the end of the pack but. The name of the game is Survival. We want to make it to the Final three and have a shot at. The million. We'll have an opportunity to Catch up and have a fighting. Chance to come in first. Everything that could go wrong Did go wrong in the last leg but. We took it as an opportunity to Challenge ourselves. Getting a chance to live through It, not do it perfectly, helps. Us get back on our game. Thank you so much, ladies. Thank you. See you in amsterdam. See you. We've gotten down to the Wire. There's no playing around. This is laser focus. Bikes unlock at 9:00 a.M. We'll be right back with the Other teams. Let's win this leg! Amsterdam! Right behind you. Straight back. Everybody thinks that a U-turn is coming up. Our game plan is to get there First, not give anybody else a. Chance to do anything to us. Today was going to be a super Competitive leg. Ride your bike to jachthaven. I can barely reach the Pedals. Jump on the seat. Hold on. What are you doing? Because it's hard. Today was our first time to Ride a tandem bike. You go to steer and the bike Doesn't turn. It's like driving a barge. Are you pedaling? No, dude. What? I'm trying to get on. You're not pedaling. No. When I pedal, it's not good. The rhythm we finally got Into was me pedaling. The rhythm we finally got Into was me pedaling. Don't stop, don't stop. Pedal fast. Last time I was on "The Amazing race" and encountered. Bicycles, it didn't go quite Well. Ultimately it's a lot easier When you don't have a lot of. Traps on your bike. Good job. It's my birthday today so I'm Hoping we can do really well and. Not get excited and stay in the Race. I'm trying to win on nicole's Birthday. Let's do it. Tandem bike is a little bit Of a thrill. I see colin and christie. This is jachthaven. Don't tell anybody where that Is. Detour. A few centuries ago, locals Here hoisted a cow to the top of. The tower to graze on some Grass, a tradition that still. Exists today. If teams can accomplish this Feat in under 40 seconds, They'll receive their next clue. This is bound to get udderly Ridiculous. If there's one thing you can say About the dutch, they sure do. Love cheese and eggs. This detour requires teams to Ride to this farm which dates. Back to 1432. They'll vault across this ditch, The dutch way. Or maybe not. Then they must pick up two Cheeses and a dozen eggs. The trick is how to get back Across the ditch with their. Cheese and fragile eggs which They have to deliver to kampen. Market for their next clue. We want to do the eggs. We can do what we want. We have to find earth number 34. Good job! Colin and christie. We're going to... We're doing high. 1-2-3 go! Are they both at number 34? No, 29. Earth 29's that way. Bye, guys. See you later. We're by ourselves. Nick... nic went to do to the Egg thing. It might be up there. My gosh. Show us how to cross the Dutch way. The dutch way to go over a ditch Is like a pole vault. You have a metal pole and Catapult yourself to the other. Side. I pole vaulted in college but This is a little tricky. Here we go. Omelette. Great. Never done anything like this that water's so cold, I don't. Want to go in again. I'm trying, babe. I've pole vaulted before. Nicole, on the other hand, well... It was terrible. I've done nothing like this pole Vaulting maneuver I had to do. She swallowed so much water. You want to switch detours? Nicole, are you kidding me? We're here. There's nobody here. I see cows. There's a bunch of cows on The right. Number 34, right here, right Here, right here! This is it. Here we go. She was a cow. Look, it's a face cow. The good news is we were not Going to be working with real. Cause. Got... cows. Got it? The cow was very cooperative, On her best behavior. Someone else is here. Leo and jamal are catching Up. Can we take you? Hello! Mooo! They're doing it, colin. She's locked in. Bessie's ready to go. This is tight. We found the cow, hoisted it up, Got it on the back of the. Trailer and we're going to Follow this trailer on our. Bikes. We're on our way to the bell Tower. 1-2-3. Do we have to follow them? There's a map. 34... 34. That way. Isn't this literally where we Just went? I know. We were either going the Right way and it's awesome or. We're going the wrong way. But I think we're going the Right way. Come on, baby, I believe in You. We need to get closer to the Ledge. You just got to jump. That's it. Jump. Good, you got up in the air. That's the dutch way. That's good. That's good? Come on, baby! I realized when I jumped, I Got up off the ground. That's what I had to do. Having that momentum to Propel her to the other side. A dozen eggs. A dozen eggs and two cheeses. Have to jump back with the Eggs and the cheese. This is going to be fun. Since crossing the dutch way was A little bit difficult for Nicole, I took it upon myself to Transport the eggs and the. Cheese back across, which was Very nerve-racking because I. Didn't want to break into the Eggs and do it again. The eggs are good. The eggs are intact. Putting the cheese in my pocket. I have some cajones, no pun Intended. We got to get to the market. Got to be careful with the Eggs. We have to come all the way Back. If we break them, yeah. Let's get a mooove on. Spin class. Hello! Beautiful. Wow, we're going to that Bell tower, I think. That's where we're going. Hello, do you like our cow? Let's go. Come on, come on. Thank you so much. Got it, leo. Watch out. Damn it. Two teams out of time. We'll be the next one to go. We'll have to use this rope And a pulley and we have 40. Seconds to get the cow all the Way to the top. I didn't know if we could Hoist our cow because it's. Really high up, it's pretty Heavy and we were neck-and-neck. With colin and christie. We didn't want to fall behind. We were worried. Ready, steady, go! Ready, steady, go! Let me just... You be pulling on it. Colin had this technique Where he was jumping and pulling. The rope down and I was just Doing the best I could to keep. Up with how fast the rope was Coming down. I think colin pretty much pulled That cow up by himself. I think colin pretty much pulled That cow up by himself. I'll run to the top of the Bell tower. Got it. That was a doozy. I I am just glad it wasn't a Real cow. Good morning! You made it! Come on, come on! Congratulations, you made it. Thank you very much, thank You. Come on, baby. Let's go. Ride your bike along... Caution, turn ahead. Teams are about to Encounter a surprise double. U-turn. With only five teams remaining And no non-eliminations left in. The race, forcing teams to Perform both sides of the detour. Will be challenging. Let's get past it. We've got to go. Fast, fast, fast. 34, could be anywhere. Hold the bike. Remember, it was 33 and then To the right. Just pointing this way. Let's go this way. No 34, we're going out in the Boonies here. Reach higher. Reach higher! There. Hold it, hold it. Colin and christie, we Overheard them saying there's a. Double u-turn ahead. In switzerland, we had a public Boat for a... vote for a u-turn. And nicole and victor, the only Team to vote for us. This is a strategy move, no Emotions involved. It wasn't smart to set up Enemies in the middle of the. Race. Pedaling a bike that's meant For two to be pedaling is. Exhausting. To make sure the eggs didn't Break, I told nicole not to. Pedal, make sure the eggs are Sustained. I'm not even pedaling and I'm Tired. U-turn right here. Right here, here it is. Ok, guys, let's talk. We'll leave it alone. Let's let everyone else work it Out. I'm ok with that. Everybody knew the the afg Animals would u-turn somebody. Drive yourself to the boat Rental and canal cruises for the. Next clue. Let's just do it. We're in to. We're in it. Here it is. We passed it. Pedal, pedal. This is it. They're not real cows. They're fake cows. 1-2-3, you got it? It's pretty light. Let's jog. Ready? Yay! We're coming for you, cow! Moo, moo! The market's right there. Watch out, don't touch anything. Hi. What do you got for me? One, two. Number two. And a dozen eggs. One, two. We delivered our eggs and our Cheese. He looked those over so Carefully. I was like, please no cracks or We'd have to start over. 12. My god, that was hard. Thank you! Thank you! Double u-turn ahead! Double u-turn ahead. I'm freaking out. Looking for a double u-turn. I'm looking at the signs. None of that is familiar. You got to hurry, though, so we Can u-turn someone else. Double u-turn ahead. We got to make sure we get There first. We want to u-turn... Nicole and victor. We're in a really big hurry. To the right. Go, go, go. Stay positive. My god. Where is it at? Where's it at? Damn it! That was it, you see. Thank god, found it. Is there already u-turns? Sorry, nicole and victor, we're Definitely going to u-turn you. To get back even. Nicole, happy birthday. Let's go. U-turn. Damn it! The afganimals u-turned us. I did say their name in Switzerland but they never got. U-turned. Hopefully team fun is behind Us, either that or let ourselves. Go out. I don't like leo and jamal. Pedal faster, pedal faster. We just saw nicole and Victor. They seemed frustrated. It could mean we made it before Them. This is probably the return, Right here. This is it. We are looking forward marked Cars now. That's them. Let's do it! Let's go. Just let them go. We are coming up, peeps. Korey and tyler, they're like Behind some cars. Can you let me out? I want to follow our friends. They all just went without Us. Look, nic and vic. Happy birthday, nicole, sorry Not sorry. I got it. Ready, steady, go! We had a strategy. We communicated. Up, pull down, up, pull down, Until we were pulling together. So neither one of us had to pull Down by ourselves. Pull, pull, pull! Strong. It's up. Ready, go. Thank you. Caution u-turn ahead. Damn it. My god. I don't even know, dude. This is difficult. It's a little bit complicated Up in here. Hopefully everyone is Struggling because these street. Signs are crazy. Boat rental canal cruises, right Here. There's the clue marker. Rock and roll to the clue Box. Race by boat, train to the Next pit stop. The village of giethoorn Has no roads or cars. Navigating through this maze of Waterways, teams must create a. Boat train and steer it through The congested canals. The pit stop of this leg of the Race. The last team to check in with Me will be eliminated. We're going to the pit stop. Let's go. We're getting to the pit stop Right now. Last team to the checkpoint Will be eliminated. Search the canal for two Locations with marked boats. I think they might be hidden. I have driven a lot of boats. I grew up on padre island on Corpus christi. I felt right at home. We're looking for boats to Attach to us. Look how cute these little Houses are. People live like this. It's awesome. Where are we? I feel like we're in a movie. It's crazy. A cat! Cats on boats on laps? That was the coolest thing I've seen in my life. Dogs. Little doggy. Birds.

We have to use the other side Of the detour, right? That sucks. Damn it. We are far behind is the reality Of it right now. Nicole, you have to pedal Hard. I am. I'm tired. I regretted having nicole not Pedal to the market. I had used a lot of my energy And now to have to go all the. Way back to the second detour Was going to be very difficult. It looks like there's a farm Thing over there. My gosh. What does this say? Those numbers don't pertain. We could not find the second Detour at all. We don't know if we would Ever find it. What are we missing? Earth 29. There it is, yes.Úit's ok, we ca victor and nicole u-turned us. So woo had to... we had to do th Other side of the detour. 12 eggs, two cheeses. Careful with them. Maybe I can throw the cheese Over. You could just toss the Cheese. Cheese isn't fragile. It's like a ball. Getting the eggs over to the Other side of the canal was a. Completely different story Because you didn't want to crack. The eggs. I held them in my hand and Went across the dutch way. I held them in my hand and Went across the dutch way. Here it is. 34. Right there. This is it. Nice. We passed it. It's right on the front. Wow. These are the cows, yeah. Stay strong. You never know what you can do. Right here, nic. I got it, I got it.
