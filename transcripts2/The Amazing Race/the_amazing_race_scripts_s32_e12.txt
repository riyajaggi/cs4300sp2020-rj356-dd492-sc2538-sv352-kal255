 We're gonna U-turn DeAngelo and Gary. Which means we're just burning the board. ...to knock out their competition. Leo and Alana... Kaylynn and Haley... Eswar and Aparna, you have been eliminated from the race. And one final move... - Do not let them see. - Okay. He just told them. They all three banded together to eliminate us. ...to take out the biggest competitors of all. DeAngelo and Gary, you have been eliminated from the race. And for the first time inAmazing Race history, an alliance of three advanced to the final leg together. All according to plan. Are you kidding me? All according to plan. But coming up tonight, - Riley and Maddison, Hung and Chee... - Ow. - ...and Will and James... - Just be calm. - ...will battle each other. - There it is, Chee! Okay, let's go, let's go. Who will win the $1 million and The Amazing Race? I'm so mad I have to do this right now. Say hello to my little friend. Now that we're on the final leg, now it's about winning. "Fly to New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S.A." Our final three teams will now complete their race around the world flying east across the Pacific Ocean to New Orleans, Louisiana. There's a party on Bourbon Street tonight, and we're here to celebrate with them. Teams must now make their way into the heart of the city in the oldest neighborhood, the French Quarter. Final leg. We are headed back to U.S.A. and good old N'awlins. Louisiana. Yes! We started the race a little shaky. We finished fourth, fourth, third, third, but Maddison and I are peaking right now. We've won the past three legs all in a row. Feels so good. To see our alliance work out? - Oh, yeah... - Like, who would've thought? I think one of the reasons why we feel prepared for this final is just based off of how much we've grown. Not only individually, but more so as, like, a cohesive unit, as brothers. This is nuts. Being in the top three further proves to us that the relationship we do have and the foundation we have set is strong. The memories to share with the kids we hope to adopt one day... This money would change our life. - Crazy. - Now let's just win. - Looks like there's a cab. - The race refreshed for me in my mind why I initially fell in love with Chee. - Aw. - Right? His sparkly quality is that he's so steadfast. He's not as intense or up-and-down as me, and that's a good thing, because otherwise we would be a wreck. I knew Hung was a very determined, loyal and trusting person, and all those qualities just came through big-time on this race. We've placed above beard brothers and boyfriends on previous legs. No reason why we can't do it again. Let's go, let's go. We are gonna win The Amazing Race. No question about it. We got this. We're gonna bring our game. I think we're gonna win it. Look at my legs. They don't touch anything. - What? No way. - What? What? What? This is amazing. Good night, America. We just got to beat two teams. For a million dollars. -Right here, the first one. - Taxi, taxi, taxi. - Taxi, taxi. So, we're going to Louis Armstrong Park. And we're racing. We got to go quick. Louis Armstrong Park. Can you take us? -Yes, thank you. Can you go very fast? -Take us there please, - as fast as you can. We just left the airport. The beards are in front of us, Hung and Chee are behind us. It's gonna be neck and neck this entire leg, which makes it a lot more exciting. Nerve-racking. - Try and beat that cab in front of us. - Yeah. We got to beat that cab in front of us. - And not let these guys pass us. - Okay. Oh, my gosh, we just passed the beards, Will. Yes. Feels really good to be back on American soil. Ah, there's beard bros. I love passing these cars. Oh, that's Chee and Hung. Damn, dude. Now that we're on the final leg, it's no longer about survival and just advancing. Now it's about winning. We believe we're in third, but Karim just said that he took a shortcut, so... Where is the park? It's to the left? To the left, yeah. You got this, Karim. Let's do this, huh? - Here we go. - We believe in you. - Right here. Right here. - Ah. - We got to go right there. - Oh, that's the arch. Go, baby. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Go. "Route Info." Mardi Gras parades began in New Orleans around the 1830s. Parade crews would toss out necklaces into crowds. Today, these necklaces remain the most popular trinkets at the celebration. Teams must now join the party and collect beaded necklaces that are being thrown from Bourbon Street's iconic balconies. When they have 50 red necklaces and 50 gold necklaces that match what the grand marshal has around his neck, they'll get a clue. Let's go. Right here? Yep. Here. Thank you, Mohammed. Come on, Chee. Come-come on. "Route Info." "Join the party on Bourbon Street "in the French Quarter and collect 50 red and 50 gold beads to receive your next clue." Bourbon's straight ahead. Do you know where we're going? Yes. Having been to New Orleans before, especially the French Quarter, I knew exactly where Bourbon Street was. So running from Armstrong Park to Bourbon Street was easy for us because I knew exactly where to go. Oh, there's Hung and Chee, Will. We're in third place. We've been in last place before and ended up winning a leg, so... Yeah, we got to make up some time here. - Here? Is this the park right here? So we overshot it? I want to make sure we show up to the right place. Is this the park right here? - You have more... Yeah. - Pull-pull over, pull over. Let's go. - You're sure it's that way? - Yeah, North Rampart... Well, wait, wait. Here's North Rampart. No, it might be that way, Riley. - Is it down there? - I don't... I don't know. You said you saw it. I didn't see it. - This is Toulouse. - I-I see N-North... Let's just run this way real fast. Come on. Now we're lost. How long is this street? Really long. Oh, I see it. - This is it. - Yes. How cool. I've been to Mardi Gras a few times. I've ridden on a float in Mardi Gras. So I feel like when we got to Bourbon Street and we saw the floats and the beads flying everywhere, I was in my element. This is so cool! Keep going straight. Okay. Keep pushing. Will and James are right there. Come on. Let's go. Will... Red, red, red, red. Here you go, Hung. Here you go, Hung. - Where is it? - No idea. Louis Armstrong Park. Louis Armstrong Park. Twenty. Louis Armstrong Park? - You know where the park is? - Louis Armstrong Park? Do you guys know where the park is? No. Ugh, this is brutal! - Louis Armstrong Park. - It's over there. That way? This way? This way. Go, Riley. Go, go, go. Oh, right here. Let's go, let's go, let's go. "Join the party on Bourbon Street in the French Quarter "and collect 50 red and 50 gold beads to receive your next clue." There is a million dollars on the table. We're gonna make up time. - Yeah, yeah. Red, red, red. Yes, gold! Gold! Ow! Bourbon Street? Are we sure? Yeah. Up there. There's a crowd up there. - That's it. - Oh, okay. Hurry up. 39, 40. We need a float. We got it, dude. We got this, we got this. We got to find the matching ones. Hey! We need gold and red. Gold and red! We need these, the big ones. We're in last place! We need help! Oh, thank you so much. All right, I got 50. Okay, I have 50. Come on. - Around your neck, around your neck. - Oh. - No? - No. All right, let's do this. The details were to watch what the grand marshal was wearing and those were the acceptable beads to catch. Will, I only have 16. It was really game-on at that point. Everyone was neck and neck. We need 50. 50 each. Hey! More of these, more of these! Bro, come on, help me! - Help! Help! - We need more of these! Big beads, big beads, big-big. I need the big ones! I need 20 more. Yo. One more! One more! James, I got it. I think I have it, too. - All right, we're ready. - We're ready. "Roadblock. Who will be left holding the baby?" The French brought king cakes like these to New Orleans about 150 years ago. These colors represent the Three Wise Men that visited Christ during his Epiphany. It's a tradition to bake little babies like this inside the cakes. Only a few of these cakes have them, and teams will need to find a baby for their next clue. -King cake? Me! Me! -You do it. You do it. Do it, do it, do it. Yes. That's so you! - "Have fun with it." Yes. - Oh, my God. We're ready! Let's go. Eight more, eight more! Come on! Let's go! Uh-uh-uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. One more. Oh, I got one more. I'm done, Chee! I'm done! Go, go, go. -Thank you so much! -Thank you! Thank you, thank you. - Thank you! Thank you! - Thank you, thank you, thank you! "Who will be left holding the baby?" You. Okay. Okay. This is brutal. We're here! Thank you! Right now I have to search for the baby in the king cake. I love king cake. I've had it probably every year of my entire life, and I know what the baby looks like. That helped me figure out a strategy. I was pushing with all my fingers trying to feel the baby. Oh, we get more. All right, here's two more cake racks for you to look through. Cool. Thank you so much. I've got to look through probably over a hundred cakes. In my mind I was, you know, trying to coax our band to dance a little bit faster, walk a little bit faster just so we could get started on the next task, you know, as soon as possible. Thank you. "Who will be left holding the baby?" -Do you want to just do it? Let's do it. -I'll do it, I'll do it. All right. Let's do it. Nobody's here yet. They might not even know what the baby looks like if they've never had a king cake. I've already gone through... a bunch of cakes. So I have a little bit of a head start. My guess is Hung and Chee are right around the corner. I hear another band coming. Go away. Turn around. It's the wrong place. Thank you, thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Looking for a tiny, little, uh, baby inside one of these cakes. Man, this, this is good forearm exercise. Yeah, we got two more cake racks for you to look... How you feeling, Chee? Arms are burning. Forearms are destroyed right now. I'm so tired. Here come the beards. Here they come. Neck and neck. Find the baby? - I found the baby. Oh, Will, you're killing me. - You're killing me, Will. - James. James! - Did he find it? - Come on! We have to eat beignets. Okay. It's like a big powdered doughnut. Just go. Mmm. And this is good. - This is so good. - There's so much powdered sugar. We're behind. No real time to think, just go time. Lot of dough. Uh... Will didn't go through that much. He didn't even touch his second rack. This is not good for you. I'm still on one. - Yeah, I need you to eat faster. - So now you can eat more. - I don't want to eat more. - You might have to. I'm gonna bloat. It's like the cinnamon challenge. Your mouth dries out. I can't. It won't go down. Will, just drink more water while you eat. Yeah, I just finished one rack, uh, now I'm onto my second one. Still no sign of the baby. - Uh-uh. - Will. You're gonna make me eat these? I might throw up. They were right on our tails, so I knew that I needed to go as fast as I could. But every time I would swallow, it would just come back up. Come on, baby. Where are you at? Where are you at, baby? We're still in this. I can't. My stomach hurts. I need you to do that. I'm sorry. We're gonna be here awhile. - Then... - I can't... James. - ...soak up all the water. - Please eat them. Sometimes the hard frosting sounds like plastic against here, so it's like, it's more frustration. It won't stay down. Oh, my God. - Sorry. - Excuse me. We're losing so much time. I'm... babe, I-I'm just, I'm trying so hard. I know you are. You need to finish that. I c... I literally cannot even finish what's in my mouth. It's super tiny, the size of this baby, so you have to be, like, super diligent going through it. That's pretty demoralizing. Get the last chunk in. Come on, come on. Okay, I'm done. -Thank you. -Thank you so much. Those were delicious. - Thank you, thank you. - You're wasting time. - I'm wasting time? - I ate four beignets. "Travel by taxi to the New Orleans Convention Center and search near Hall H for your next clue." Okay, we need a taxi. Being extremely thorough. Don't want to miss it a second time. I can see the baby, but right at the top of the table, Chee is never gonna see it. I see it and I can't help him at all. That was probably one of the most frustrating points of the race. - Man. - Don't give up. No, I'm not gonna give up. I'm gonna find this thing. Going through my last two here, and, uh, it's starting to sink in that I got to go through them again. Chee, we got this, dude. All right. Really need this last task to be impossible so we can catch up time. We found a taxi pretty quick. Jackson, you are our saving grace. Hall H. That's it. Thank you so much. - Have a good night. - Near Hall H. Oh, I see it. Come on. Come here. Ready? "Roadblock. Who wants to take a swing at this Roadblock?" "If you performed the last Roadblock, your partner must attempt this one." Looks like it's my turn. The Mighty Mississippi is arguably the most famous river in America. There are more than 100 bridges crossing what many people call Old Man River. This Roadblock requires teams to climb under the Crescent City Connection bridge, then climb out onto this enormous beam and leap out into the pitch dark to grab a clue almost 200 feet above the dark, imposing Mississippi River. "Take a provided marked vehicle parked by Hall H with your teammate to the challenge area." We're going to Crescent City Connection bridge. - Awesome. - We can do it. I love heights so much. Heights is not my thing. And when you add the darkness with heights, that's just not a good equation for James. That's when the fear starts kicking in. - You can do it. - I know I can do it. That doesn't mean I want to do it. I didn't want to fiddle through - k-king cakes. - Yes, you did. Your face lit up when you saw the idea of a king cake. You know, my rushing through all the cakes caused me to miss the baby the first go-around. No other choice but to just go back and-and redo it. I know I'm not supposed to say sorry, Hung, - but sorry, Hung. - Don't say sorry. I was trying to, like, telepathically tell him to look at the baby. Focus. Uh, I'm starting from the bottom ones 'cause, I mean, I felt like I was thorough with those, but I was definitely more thorough earlier. Oh, my gosh. It's there. It's right there. All right. Found it. Here you go. Okay. Oh, that looks good. Thank you so much. We just eat three a piece? Have to do it. I just saw the size of the baby, and I wasn't expecting it to be that small. It was just sitting there on the table, and I didn't notice it. It's not looking good for us. 180 feet? Have you swung from this bridge? So I'm, like, the guinea pig? Just like, of course it's me. It's me. I'm the one that has to this. Oh, my gosh. Holy crap. All right. Thank you so much. Ridiculous. I'm so nervous, Will. This is not fun. You can do it. I'm not the best with heights. I'll be honest. I feel scared for him 'cause I know that he's scared of heights. - Sit down? - Yep. The moment the guy told me I had to sit on the ledge, that's when it really started to sink in: "Okay, I'm gonna swing... He said 180 feet," and I knew I had to grab the clue without dropping it in the Mississippi River. I know you can do this. Oh, my gosh. I'm so mad I have to do this right now. This is for a million dollars. I understand it's for a million dollars, but it... you don't just do this for fun. Don't look down, look at the clue. Three, two... Don't look down, look at the clue. Just grab it. You got it. You got it. Three, two... My God! You did it. - Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God! Oh, my God! I did that. How cool. I'll never do it again. Oh, my God. The feeling was the sensation of a really tall drop on a roller coaster that you regret going on. My God! It was a moment that I'll never forget. Rappel off the bridge and roll a gigantic ball to Mardi Gras World." Both team members must now rappel 180 feet down to the ground. Then, teams will make their way on foot to Mardi Gras World, rolling a ten-foot-high ball down the street. Teams started with a party in Trinidad, and will now let the good times roll here in Louisiana. This 300,000-square-foot warehouse is the largest float design and construction facility - in the world. - Oh, my gosh, let's go. I'm so proud of you. And now we have to rappel off the bridge. High five. Ah. It's a small world. - Why is that? - 'Cause my friend was waiting for some people to come out for The Amazing Race. - I was just on the phone with him. - Oh, yes. That's, uh, that's o-other people - that we're trying to beat. - Yeah. - Right on. - Are they still there? Yeah, they were still there... As of, like, five minutes ago, - they was. - Oh, fantastic. Will, no other teams are here yet. But these heights are no joke. I, like, am only focusing on not dying. - How you feeling, baby? - Holy caca. I'm trying not to look down. Just be calm! We're not gonna die. - You good? - Yeah. - Wow! - Oh, my gosh. We did it. Okay. There it is. - Big ball. - How do you get it out of there? Let me get in. Let me get in. Wait, baby, does it open? - No. - Do you need help? Oh, I got it, I got it. Don't crush me. Oh, my God, it's so huge. Wait, there's the... - there's the arrow, Will. - Okay, go. Push it, baby. Go. Will, come on. Thank you so much. We've watched old seasons and we've seen how some final legs can be really tough, especially that last Roadblock. - There it is, Chee. - Okay, let's go, let's go. So I certainly didn't give up hope. Here we go. "Who wants to take a swing at this Roadblock?" Oh. "If you performed the last Roadblock, your partner must attempt this one." - So this is you. - "Swing under the Crescent City -Connection bridge to receive your next clue." -All right. Holy cow. - This is amazing. - Hopefully I can do this in one go. Um, I don't like heights. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! No! No, I absolutely did not enjoy the Berlin experience. And because I have short T-Rex arms, there was a chance I would miss grabbing the clue when I jumped off the bridge. If that happened or if I dropped the clue, I would have to redo the whole thing, and it takes a while to get re-rigged up. That is awfully far, my friends. Jump. Just push off. Go get it. Go get it. Hopefully she can grab this. Oh, my gosh. Oh, man. Yeah! You got it! I'm so proud of you! Nice job! - Nice job. - Oh, my gosh. Come on, Maddison. Let's go, baby. Man, I don't know what to do. I just want to get through this. Really, the only way... Found it? Found it. Say hello to my little friend. I know people have struggled in other challenges and have had... been put behind, but, like, you have to keep pushing through. - You never know. - All right, let's go. This is Mardi Gras World. - It is? - On the left. There's the entrance right there. Will, look it. Right here. Great, let's go. This is so cool. How awesome is this? I wish I knew what we were looking for. You see any... Right there. Go. "Search the warehouse for a trunk with puzzle pieces "and attach the pieces to your ball to make a gigantic globe of planet Earth." After circling the planet, teams will now go around the world again. They must search this warehouse among thousands of Mardi Gras decorations to find a crate containing 32 pieces of a giant globe puzzle, which they must correctly place on their ball in order to create the world and get their final clue. - "Search the warehouse." - Let's go this way. We need a court jester. Oh, my gosh, this place is huge. Over here. Oh, wait, no. "Search for a chest." Come on. Right there. Oh, my gosh. - Grab it. - Okay. Go. Babe, I'm so proud of you. - Good work, babe. - We got this. We need to make the globe out of these puzzle pieces we found. - Where should we start? - They're strips. - Let's put them in order. - On the ground? Yes. - Here's Florida. - This is Saudi Arabia. This is Mexico and California. We practiced our geography before coming on the race, - and James is actually really good at geography. - This is... This is California. So, that's India. I'm trying to do North America over here, Will. Our strategy, though, was to really lay out the pieces on the ground first before applying it to the ball. I need more of South America. - Here's just water. - The oceans are gonna be hard. - Right here. - This goes here. This is... might be Australia. No, that doesn't look right. Oh, my gosh. There's so many pieces, Will. Okay. - Okay. - Cool. - All right. - First time rappelling. I have no idea what to expect. Oh... Ah... Wow. Look at this. Yeah. This is it, Riley. Yeah? Riley, it's in there. "Who wants to take a swing at this Roadblock? "Note, if you performed the last Roadblock, -your partner must attempt this one." -All right. Here we go, bud. Babe, I really think we should start building. Let's put our puzzle together. Okay. Let's start here. Put that on the end? Line it along the crease, like this. Smart. 'Cause the ball was so big, you had to do one piece at a time. - You good? - Yeah, that's good. -Stay there. Hold it. Hold it there. -I'll hold it. So it took a little bit of time. But I think because we had mapped out the entire globe on the floor, we were able to go really quickly to put all the pieces on. Oh, my gosh, this looks so good. - I think we're more than halfway done. We are. I want to get out of here before another team shows up, babe. - Almost there, Hung. - Almost there. Okay, let's go. I'm getting ready to do something I really don't want to do, but desperate times. I've never seen him in high places, so first time for everything. You got this. Yeah, buddy. Oh, my God. Are you kidding me? This is gnarly. - You good? - Yeah, I guess. Dude, you got this. Yeah, buddy! Holy moly! - Wow. - Oh! Go. Go, go, go. We're so close. The white goes up here 'cause it connects to Greenland. Babe, you're doing so good. You're almost done. - Last one. - We're almost done. Let me read the clue one more time. Wait, Will, we have to place it upright on the float. Okay. You ready to lift? - Okay, go. - I'm lifting, just push from the bottom on your side. - Okay. - Good job. Keep doing it. Stop. You've got it on the float, babe. - That was... - Okay. Can we get a check, please? We got this. - Hello, sir. - Hello, sir. I'm so nervous, Will. Your map is correct, but your assembly needs work. Oh, my gosh, we have to start over. It's so hard, 'cause when you put it up there, - it all comes undone. - Okay, the pieces don't fit. - This is ridiculous. - Got it. And we had such a strong lead. This is unbelievable. Over here! Keep going straight! Oh, here. Keep going straight! Go, go, go. All right. Let's do it, Riley. Here we go. Let's keep pushing. Oh, there's the giant ball. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go! Hurry, hurry, hurry. - We're almost done. - Let's go. Our globe has the right map, but it's not perfect in assembly. Maybe pull that tighter? There we go. But push from the bottom, push from the bottom. That looks so much better than last time. Now can we get a check? Congratulations. - We did it? - You finished the float. Thank you. This is it. Run to the finish line of The Amazing Race. Teams must now make their way to their final destination, the New Orleans Superdome, home to the 2010 Super Bowl champions. The first team to find me here on the New Orleans Saints football field will win $1 million and The Amazing Race. "Travel by taxi to the main entrance of where the Saints go marching in." Go, go, go, go. Oh, my God. I'm freaking out. Do you know where the Saints go marching in? - The Superdome. - The Superdome. Do you see it? It's somewhere here. - "Mardi Gras World." - Oh, here. Yeah, I see it. - Come on, Chee. - Over here. - Okay. - Just up ahead. - Chee, Chee, Chee, Chee. - It's right here. Okay, good. This is it. Court jester trunk... Right here, Chee. - You just passed it. - Oh, man. Good eye. Let's line them up first, and then put... Attach it to the ball. It looks better on the floor first. Safe to say we never built a puzzle this big. Pick a continent to... We'll start building from there. Riley, hurry up. Let's go. Go, go, go. - Let's go. - Yeah, let's do it. All right. Mardi Gras World. Hurry, hurry, hurry. - We did it. - We did it. We're going to the Superdome. We're going to the finish line. Oh, my God. Our families are gonna be so proud. - There it is. - Let's go. Come on, babe. It's lit up in race colors. Oh, my God. - Ready? Three, two... - Here we go. Look at that! Oh, my gosh! I love you. 11 countries, 17 cities, more than 33,000 miles. Will and James, I am pleased to tell you you have won the $1 million and The Amazing Race. Congratulations. - I'm so... - Ah! They were rooting for you guys. - Thank you. - When did you realize that today was just going so well, when y... and-and you were ahead? When I jumped off a bridge. - Yeah? - What the heck was that? I'm just wondering, what-what does it feel like? I mean, I'm a superfan. I've been watching since I was 11. And so, I have applied for this race at least nine to ten times with various family and friends. But who knew that you were my partner all along? Not only in this race but in life. I love everything about you. You're my best friend. And thank you for being patient with me 'cause I had so many crazy moments. There are no words for this entire experience, from day one until now, all the things that we've been able to do, all the experiences that we've had, together. With you by my side, I felt at home everywhere we were. This is remarkable. It's really special to share with Will. We love you. We're so happy for you. Thank you, you guys. - Thank you. - Thank you. I couldn't imagine, uh, loving a team that U-turned us more. In this moment right now, looking at your life partner, the winner, your-your teammate here, of The Amazing Race, what do you want to tell everybody, the world and-and your friends and your family a-about James? What is it that's so special about him? Everything. He's the kindest person I've ever met. And he has the biggest heart of anybody I know. And I love you so much. - And I know The Amazing Race has been your dream, but my dream is to spend the rest of my life with you. James... - ...will you marry me? - Yes. I can't even speak, but yes. Oh, my God. Thanks, baby. Holy smokes. - What a great day. - What a great day. I mean, the engagement was a pretty easy yes. Like, come on. And how cool, that it was at the finish line, of all places? With Phil and all the other teams, all our new friends. Like, they're all coming to our wedding. Oh, yeah. Everyone's invited. - What? I just heard some footsteps. Maybe they're coming, Chee. There it is. Stop. This is Mexico and the U.S. I'm just laying them all out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good plan. - You can start putting them together if you want. Check, please. Hi. How are you? So, uh, your assembly needs a little work. - Okay. All right, we'll tighten it up. - Okay. Good work. Yes. - Ugh... - Ow. Oh, my God, Chee. A lot of it fell. We can do this, dude. We just need those and we're good. Yeah. Let's go, let's go. I'm finishing off the bottom. Yeah, I am, too. Okay, it looks like we have another team coming in. Who's it gonna be? Yeah! Hung and Chee, after 33,000 miles racing around the world, I am pleased to tell you that you're team number two. Very proud of you guys. You guys ran a solid race. - You should be very proud of yourselves. Thank you, Phil. The race was the honeymoon that we never had. It was absolutely phenomenal. We got to do and see things that we never would have otherwise been able to do. I think the race has made us closer. Um, I hope you agree. This is my opinion. Riley and Maddison, you are officially the third team on Amazing Race, a pretty extraordinary effort against some very, very tough teams, so congratulations. Thank you. Me and Riley compete in beach volleyball. People probably thought we're gonna take our professional athlete background and bring it to the race, and, like, - we've picked up a lot more things on the race... - Yeah. ...that we're gonna bring back to our volleyball careers. I think the race is gonna help our careers more than our careers helped us on the race. Well, I can tell you a cool statistic. You are all a part of Amazing Race history because we have just rolled over one million miles on The Amazing Race, and you are a part of that history. Thank you. Good job. WinningThe Amazing Race still does not feel real to me. It's something I have envisioned ever since I was 11 years old. And to be here, it's a dream come true.
