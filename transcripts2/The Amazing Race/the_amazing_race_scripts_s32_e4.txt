 Previously on The Amazing Race, nine teams raced through the heart of the Amazon, Manaus, Brazil. Will and James officially forged an alliance... - Let's make it to the finals, boys. - Perfect. ...and set their sights on a U-Turn target. Use it on Leo and Alana. The sooner they're gone, the better. At a crowded market in Brazil, the alliance proved valuable. Fill them up exactly the same. A major mistake sunk father and son Jerry and Frank early.

 Everybody has their bag. We don't have our stuff. We have to go back. Damn it! In a tribal village, Will and James served up a U-Turn to Leo and Alana... We're making big moves. ...causing anger and tears. I just don't want this to be the end. Kaylynn and Haley returned a favor to help their friends. - We have to, right? - We have to. In the end, Will and James won the leg... You're team number one. ...while Jerry and Frank couldn't recover. You are the last team to arrive.

 We had a winning experience. I wouldn't trade it for the world. Eight teams remain. Who will be eliminated next? Oh, my God, look. Let's go. We're on the Amazon! - This is incredible. - Wow. Wow. It's unreal. Wow, what a day. They just pulled up. They're right there. Oh, they're gonna be so mad at us. Like, that was a hard day. - Do you think they'll even acknowledge us? - No. Will and James hurt us in the last leg. - We do have a Yield... - And we would Yield Will and James. Yeah. Taste of their own medicine. If they leave, we're not sad about it. I thought that you were joking when you said we'd been U-Turned at first. I was like, "That's a mean joke," and then we turned around the corner and I was like... "These guys." - Oh! - We thought we were... - We thought that, of the four people cooking... Uh, we thought that you U-Turned us. Oh, my gosh, where are we going today? Will and James will be the first to leave the Amazon forest and fly more than 1,500 miles to Paraguay in the heart of South America. They'll land here in the capital city of Asunción, and find their next clue at the Orquesta de Reciclados de Cateura. All righty. Let's go to Paraguay. During leg number two, we formed a... semi-alliance with four other teams. That's Gary and DeAngelo, Hung and Chee, Riley and Maddison and Eswar and Aparna. - Obrigado. - And it's carried over into leg three, hopefully now into leg four. We are departing Manaus at 3:00 a.m. Communication is definitely something we've struggled with a little bit in, uh, real life, and also, in the race, there are parts that we still are struggling with. - Yeah. - But there are instances where we're doing really well. As always, there's room for improvement, but I think our communication is getting better. Oh, wait, there's laptops, you guys. We get to the 24-hour Internet area. We wanted to look up information for our five-team alliance. If you're not gonna take advantage of these helpful things, you're not here to win. The last leg, we came in third place, and we want to stay there and just keep moving up - in the ranks. - I know. Haley and I moved out at a really young age. - I moved out at 15 and Haley moved out at 16. - Yeah. So we've always landed on our feet, and Haley and I have always just depended on ourselves and each other. We're doing what we have to do to win this. We're not ready to go. It's about surviving and advancing, and we feel pretty good about staying in South America. So, we're professional beach volleyball players. The tournaments we play in are double-elimination. - So you can have that one mess-up... - That's a good point. ...and move on and kind of redeem yourself. Here, it's a pretty good chance if you get last, you're-you're out. So, the last leg didn't go as quite as well as we wanted it to. Hopefully there's physical challenges coming up. 'Cause those play to our strengths. - Thank you. - Obrigado. So we're leaving Brazil and we're going to Asunción, P-Paraguay. Isn't that in Africa? We know Uruguay is in Africa, but Paraguay, I can't even... I-I, like, I'm having a brain fart. We are so thrilled to find out that there is only one flight, and we're all gonna be on it. So our last place is gone. - We're now able to again compete for first. - We're tied for first. - Hey. Did we beat y'all here, or what happened? - Hey, guys. - Uh, no, we went inside. - Ah, okay. Yep. So we printed out maps for our alliance, and the blondies have no idea we used the printer. So Maddison and Gary are distracting them so they don't know that we got maps of Paraguay. It's time to get a little bit more competitive and, you know, turn on the cute and fun. And the plot thickens. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Come on, come on! Let's go, come on! Yeah! Come on, fast, fast, fast! - Hey, hey! - Taxi. Taxi? Come on. Rápido. - - We are in Asunción, Paraguay. We just got off the plane. So we're... please... Going to Orquesta de Reciclados? - Sí. - ...De Cateura? - You know where that is? - You know where it is? Gracias. I hope it's something music. - You know where that's at? - No, no. You don't know where that's at? - Oh... - Other taxi? - Other taxi. Why? -He doesn't know. - Do you know... - We're switching taxis because he doesn't know where the orchestra is. Do you know where the orchestra is? ¿Dónde está... orquestro? Do you know where it is? Will... - ¿Que hora? - Yeah, you know where that's at? Let's go. - Stop. Stop. - Stop. - Stop, stop, stop. - Stop. We're getting out. Taxi? Taxi? I think I actually saw Will and James having a bit of a harder time finding their next cab. Yeah. So, good. - Of all the teams to see struggling... - Yeah. ...they're the ones that we'd like to see struggling the most today. Taxi? Orquesta de Reciclados... Ah, gracias, gracias. D... Let's go. Gracias. Wow, this is definitely, like, some crazy part of town right now. So it kind of reminds us, like, when we go to India, the roads are kind of crowded and, like, not that well-kept. I'm hoping that this is a back door or a quick way to get here, 'cause if it's not, I'm-a be pissed. Oh, that's it. Yeah. Here we go. Let's keep pushing. "Who is feeling instrumental?" If you've ever heard the expression "One person's trash is another person's treasure," this could be the very definition. The Landfill Harmonic of Cateura, where every instrument has been made from trash. It was started to help young people stay in school, develop their creativity and provide a better future. This Roadblock requires teams to figure out how to repurpose items from a landfill to build a cello. When it's music to their ears, they'll get a clue. - I'm gonna do this Roadblock. - Okay. - "Who's feeling instrumental?" - You are. - Want me to do it? Okay. - Yeah. Okay. I need to just search the recycle pile for items that can be made into working musical instruments. Okay. These are the pieces I need to make a cello. I need that square gasoline thing. Yeah, same. Oh, here's one. Not an orchestra. All righty. - "Who's feeling instrumental?" - Me. Next thing. Need one of these trays. I have some confidence that I can do this faster than at least some teams, 'cause I played a lot of string instruments. My mom is a teacher of string instruments, so I've grown up surrounded by violins, cellos, violas. They're all familiar to me. This is not the orchestra hall I was expecting. I think I'm in first place, but I'm not gonna let that distract me. There's a lot of things that I need to get done here. "Choose a workstation, use the provided tools and materials to assemble a cello." Okay. Let's see what this looks like. Just trying to figure out the best way to go about this right now. - Yeah, wait, wait, wait. Stay here. Stay here. - Wait. - "Who's feeling instrumental?" Yeah. I'll take this one. - This is you. "Who is feeling instrumental?" - You. - I am, I am. Okay, one, two. All right, so, I'm gonna figure out the strings. Let's get these untangled first. Good. Just seems like it's gonna be the hardest thing to do. We got... Eswar. We'll see how much of a builder I am today. I think the really tough part is we're not really sure exactly what the steps were. But being a software engineer, that could help. I think that general kind of engineering skill might apply. So I just, uh, tried to emulate the demo cello as closely as possible. Okay, stringing this together's gonna look pretty difficult. Starting to get crowded up. "Choose a workstation." "Then start rebuilding this instrument for students who are poor." I think I got my last item. - I'll do it. - You got it, bitch. I'm trying to put the strings in. That's, like, the biggest hurdle. There we go. Okay. Do this... No expectations of this being easy. One, because I'm just not handy, and, you know, putting instruments together is not something you do every day. All these pieces are recycled, which is pretty dope. You know, I'm looking, like, "How are these pieces gonna make a musical instrument?" But I put stuff together all the time. My number one claim to fame is putting IKEA furniture together with no instructions. I got this. I... honestly, this doesn't feel right at all. None of this feels right. - I feel like there's no way other teams went this way. - No way. Oh. Mucho. Mucho. We're very far, she's saying. I find it kind of hard to believe that there... the orchestra is near this area. - Where are we going? - I don't see any other taxis. It's kind of scary on this side. Why are we going this route? We're in a frickin' race. Let's just pray somebody else got lost, too. - No. No. - No. Nope, nope. Nope. - No, no, no. No bueno. - That's not it. This cannot be it. - Oh, my God. - She's about to get us killed. This is bad. - She's getting out of... - She's getting out - to look and see. - ...the car. - Because she just asked some random... oh, my God. - Oh, my God. We need to get out of here. This is my worst nightmare. She has no idea where she's going, she's so lost, she's stopping, - she's getting out of the car. - She's outside at a house. - She's outside at a house. - And left us all in the car. And left us in the car. - This is insane. - This is a nightmare. This is bad. - This is so bad. We're literally stopped at someone's house... - What is going on? Where she's on the phone. - This is insane. - She has no idea where we're going. It was, like, a little funny at first, but, like, it's not funny anymore. This is bad. Hey. Wait, is that the clue box, Victoria? Yep, yep, yep. Yeah. "Who is feeling instrumental?" Okay, so open it. How did you do it? You just threaded it through? Yeah, just put it through the hole and then twist it. He doesn't need help. I hope that, um, my musical background will give me an advantage. Gonna try to work quietly, 'cause... I don't want the other teams to know what I'm doing. Do you put it in before you put it in the hole, Chee? Put it in the hole and then twist it. The Roadblock was awesome because Chee, DeAngelo, Maddison, myself and Eswar, whenever there was a question any of us had, we would take the time to ask each other. - DeAngelo. Did you glue this? - Yeah. - Or did it, did it stay up on its own? - Nah, it stayed up on its own. The five of us really did want to help each other. I love making string instruments. A, B, C, D, E, F, G. G, F, E, D, C, B, A. It's really humbling to see how creative and ingenious you folks are. And I have kids this age, right? And so, it's, um, it's just really beautiful and humbling. - Group hug. Group hug. - Aw. Sweaty group hug. I feel good because Victoria and I were in the symphony. I am very familiar with instruments. Come on, screw. Check. Experto. Yes. Thank you. I'm going down the street to deliver this. I felt like a proud father, because the instrument that I just made, it sounds great. You guys are amazing! - - Magnifico. Yes. "Travel by taxi to Paseo de los Yuyos "at Mercado 4 and find the marked tereré vendor "to receive your next clue. Yield ahead. Get your hourglass ready." - Yes. Taxi! - Where's our taxi? - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Where are we? Oh, my God. - Oh, my God, where... - Is that a marker? Is that it? - Are we here? Oh, my God. - Are we here? - By the grace of God, we found where we're going. Oh, my God. - Is that you or me? - It's your turn. - I'll take it. - Kaylynn's doing it. I'm not getting frustrated yet, um, just trying to figure this last bit out, 'cause attaching the strings is taking a little bit longer than I expected. Okay, a wooden crate. Oh, okay. I've got one. This is very tedious. Every detail counts. Steady as they go. Just not trying to make any mistakes that would make me have to redo this whole thing. Oh, my God. Oh, man, this is hard. Hey, how did you get this thing to not move? - Make it one tension first... - Okay. - And then that way you-you can get this in place. - Yeah, okay. Oh! That was so dumb. Taxi ride from hell. So, we're looking for Mercado 4 and we're looking for a marked tereré vendor. Mercado 4, right here. Number 4, right here. - It's right there, it's right there. - No, no, no, no! - Straight, straight, straight. - Wait, wait, wait. There it is right there. Good job. We choose not to yield anybody. "Route Info." Mmm. This is the national drink of Paraguay, tereré. The taste is hard to describe, but the medicinal properties include vitality, vigor, and physical and mental stimulation. Teams must prepare tereré the traditional way, then fill up a termos, which they will carry as a refreshment for the rest of the leg. You watch, you watch. - Okay. - Put it in there and then crush it. - Okay. So, did he take this flower? - Uh... Put it in there and crush it. That's what he did. - Yeah, but it's... - No, no, no. I am making the national drink here in Paraguay. That involves beating up a bunch of plants. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. This is gonna be awesome. We left the Roadblock in first place, and we believe we're still in first place, because we haven't seen any other teams. Oh. -Bien. -Perfect. -Muy bien. - "Detour." - "Detour." Teams are about to face the first-ever Double Switchback, balancing bottles and stacking watermelons. Vendors can expertly stack them in ten-story-high pyramids. Looks easy enough, but let's not forget what happened the last time racers tried to perform this feat. In season 20, it was a crash course in watermelon stacking. - Oh, my gosh. - We need to take every one of them out. And the bottle balancing proved - no easier. - Holy cow. Nobody knows exactly why the women here in Paraguay started balancing bottles on their heads, but there's no denying it takes a lot of skill. It's not gonna work. In this Detour, both team members must complete this choreographed routine without breaking a bottle to get their next clue. - We-We're gonna do "Stack Your Melons." - "Your Melons." - - Yes. This is a, more of a strength challenge for us, so this was just a logical choice for us. The other one was dancing, and we're not really one to dance. Um, hopefully, I-I did it right. And if I didn't do it right, back to the drawing board. - - No. Okay. Wow. The guide, you know, he measured the length. This needs to be 28 inches. Our taxicab was just insanely lost the entire time. Everyone's already almost done by the time I got here, and this is really freaking confusing. I've never built a cello in my entire life. Check, please. Thank you, thank you, thank you. All right, looks like James got it. Good for him. Gracias. Gracias. Come here, baby. - ALL: Aw. To see these kids find so much joy in what they're doing is something that I want our kids to have, is to find their passion and to find what they love. And I can't wait to have a bunch of babies. He was ready for babies yesterday. Let's be real. Thanks, guys. - Do you see the watermelon? - No, we'll find it. - Okay. I'll... We'll leave this in. Wait. - All right. Wait. - Right here. Over here. - Oh, Gary, that's a ton of watermelon. Look-look at here. One, two, three, four... - Ten. - You want to catch 'em? - Let me find the spots where... - Oh... You got to let me find the spots. Don't do it until I turn to you. This will come in handy for us 'cause we play football, so if I can't catch a watermelon thrown at me, there's something going on. This just plays right into our skill set. We choose not to yield. "Make tereré, the national drink of Paraguay." - ¿Sí? - Yeah. Oh. - Ooh, that smells so good. - Oh, my God, I cannot wait to drink it. - Wh... It's good, it's good. - Oh, good. - ¿Agua? ¿Agua? - Agua. - Delicioso. - Oh, heck yeah. Gracias. "Perform a traditional Paraguayan bottle dance "to receive your next clue in this classic Switchback challenge." - Oh, my God, we just watched that episode. - No. We practiced at home... - How weird. - ...after we watched that episode because we were like, "Oh, my gosh." - "Let's just try it." - Had to do it. We didn't drop it, so I'm hoping that we can not drop it this time. This is, like, really freaking hard. Gracias. No está bien. I'm not too sure what the issue is, but I'm gonna find out real soon. Okay. This needs to be 28 inches. Looks like 28 to me. Okay, let's try again. I'm gonna do this bottom screw around here. Finito. Feeling good. I see the end of the tunnel. Gracias. Maddison? This needs to be 28 inches. - - Man... Oh, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, I did. So I loosened up this, which makes sense, 'cause this thing was sticking all the way down. I don't think that was right. It was different from the example, so now I'm just double-checking - the example. - Oh, shoot. That'd been an epic fail. - Está bien. - Thank you. Thank you very much. This is, like, the hardest thing I've ever done - in my entire life. - You got to string all of them loosely first, and then go back - and tighten them. - Okay. Thank you so much. Come on, Maddison. We got here first by a good ten minutes, so I'm a little concerned as to what's going on in there. I'm just having a hard time with these strings. It was so confusing. Putting the strings in there, like, they had to be t-tightened the right way, had to come over, not under. And then they all had to be on the right side. And, like, dude, it was brutal. Wait, why does this go loose, then? Make sure we get ten in there. So the trick is, put it on its natural resting spot, and you got to have a mix of big and small ones. - Yeah. - So make sure you got ten on each side. - Right. - There's ten, there's ten there. You got ten on that side over there? - Yeah, I got ten over there. - Well, good. - We're flying through right now. - Okay. - Yeah. - I think it's gonna be easy. Come on, baby. Go. Yes. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. As a superfan, it was super exciting to know it was a Switchback, especially from a season we had just freshly watched. If there's anything we learned from season 20, it's that the real kicker was just concentrating. Three lunges. Superman. Ready? Here we go. Really, this takes a lot of focus and patience. This is very hard. But we're gonna get it. - Here, Hung, here. - Oh, here, here, here. We choose not to yield anybody. It looks like two of the stations are already done, which makes sense. And then you pour that in. Mmm. Very, like... This tastes like tea. - Mmm. Gracias. - Like herbal tea. It's actually pretty good. - Muchas gracias. - Gracias. Muchas gracias. - Okay, we choose... - We choose, uh... "Use Your Melon." Slowing down because I'm a little bit of all three of, like, confusion, tiredness, not really sure what I'm doing. My engineering background is not currently helping me out as is quite clear. No. Come on, my guy. Boom, 28. Yes! Yes! This better be him. - You see how you tie it up there, too? - Yeah. And then this has to be 28 inches from there. It's like the smallest things. Muchas gracias. Thank you, my man. Oh, God. It's in order. Merci. Thank you! I feel pretty helpless right now. Just sucks. We were neck and neck for first tier, and now we are competing not to be last. I'm struggling so hard right now with the strings, so... I think the really tough part was just stringing the instrument. You have to get the strings just tight enough that they would actually play a note, but if you made them just a little too tight, - - Then the bridge would snap and then you have to start from the beginning again. If we can get it on this go... Maybe not. It's just me and Es right now. I feel like I'm gonna be here all night. Come on... - "Tereré." - Ooh, I see it. - Tereré. Tereré. - No Yield, no Yield! At that point, Will and James were ahead of us, so it doesn't really make sense to use the Yield. - "Detour." - "Detour." Yeah, we're using our melon, we're using our melon. It's way harder than it looks. Ready? Go. It's over here, Chee. Chee and Hung are here now. - Yeah, we make one circle. - Circle. Okay? And then we turn around in the circle. Nope, nope. You're off-center. Here. Take as long as you need. Okay, experiment with different places. I think we must go through here? - Okay, oh, she's gonna teach us. - Oh, okay. Okay. - Will. - Yas, queen, you did it. - Oh, my gosh. - It's me that's the problem. Because I'm a dancer, I spot, and I can't spot. You need to focus on the bottle, nothing else. I know, but that's like reteaching me how to walk. - Three... - Left, and then uno, dos, tres, and then down. I think I'm slowly getting the hang of this. Now I'm trying to help Hung, uh, figure out her right balance point. It's pretty tricky. We're gonna have to practice for quite a while. So close. - Oh, right here, Riley. - Yeah. - We choose not to yield anybody. - Yeah, we're not yielding anyone. The blondes showed up so late to the Roadblock and Eswar was struggling a lot, so we thought we had enough of a lead - where we didn't have to burn it. - It just would've been evil. - Let's do "Stack Your Melons," right? - Okay, good, good, good. - Yeah. We're gonna do "Stack Your Melons." - Let's go. Yeah. We declare not to yield anyone. - "Detour." - "Detour." - Let's go. Bottle dance. - Bottle dance. Go... Let's go. Bro, you got to stop throwing 'em like that. You got to get away from that tree. See? You got to get away from that tree. Hold up... I'm obviously a better thrower. I'm the better catcher. These watermelons don't compare in weight to a football. But, again, we don't have to worry about somebody taking our head off, either. We get this done, we'll be in first. Let's get it done, then. Damn it. I'm having a problem because I don't have the balance. I can't balance it on my head. I don't know. - Gracias. - Gracias. Oh, yes. Oh, the-the sisters are already here. - I say we switch, yeah. - You want to go? You want to go? I say we switch. The progress is too slow. - Okay, let's go. We're gonna switch Detours. - Okay. - We're gonna switch Detours. - Okay. - Kneel. Left leg... - Kneel... Oh, these are lunges? - These are lunges? - Yeah. Hung and Chee left, baby. - James, don't get frustrated. We got this. - I'm not frustrated, but I'm just saying. This is gonna be hard. What the hell? I'm not gonna give up. Okay. If I were to give up, then I would let Haley down and I would let myself down. Maybe somebody's still stuck at another challenge. Maybe there's hope. I'm not ready to be out. - Oh. - See? You got to be careful. Oh, there's the pallets, Riley. There's the watermelons. How hard is this? It's hard. We got it, dude. We got this, we got this. Hey, guys. - Hey. - Hey. Hey, it's hard. Hey, guys. - It's tough, it's... - It looks... Yeah, we know. - You think that's the best way? Okay. - Yep. Oh. Two other teams showed up. We had to make sure we get this thing right. - Ten. Ten by ten. - Uh, look at the angle, Chee. On one side, it's horizontal, and then the other direction... Yeah, it looks like the bottom layer, - they're all horizontal like this. - Yes. Yeah. Let me know if you need a drink or something. No, I need anything, Chee. Just focus. We-We're not competing for first. I just need to finish this. We just need to finish this. Slow and steady. All right, Gary. We got to hurry up. - I'm hurrying, man. Calm down. - Okay. Oh, that sucked, bro. Come on. These women are absolutely incredible. This is not as easy as they make it look. Oh! Come on, baby, we got this. We literally have this. Oh, my gosh! Yes! "Race to your next Pit Stop at Plaza Italia." Teams must now make their way here, to Plaza Italia, named after the many Italian families who live here in the neighborhood. It is now the Pit Stop for this leg of the race. The last team to find me here may be eliminated. - Good luck. Good luck, you guys. - Good luck, good luck, good luck. Please, please. Check. Thank you. Did you get it? Think he got it. Oh, my God. - Let's go, babe. - There he is. - Hey, Phil! - - - How we doing, guys? Welcome to Paraguay. - - Gracias. - Will and James... - Yes. I am pleased to tell you that you are team number one. Oh, my God! And I have some great news for you. As the winners of this leg of the race, you have won $5,000 each, which you can enjoy after the race. - What? - Oh... How would you assess your performance so far? P... I-I mean, you've done pretty well in the last few. I think we're surprising ourselves and maybe surprising every other team here. I knew we had it in us, but, like, when you're up against people like former football players, here we are in first again. - Good work, good work, dude. - Yeah. I think Riley's strategy right now is good, building up one side, and not doing it all layer by layer by layer. It's gonna help us put together the top. - Here you go. - Let's keep going. So, what-what is the problem, Chee, what-what are we...? - You need to talk to me. - I, uh... These spaces aren't even, so... So what do you want to do about it, Chee? I'm not down there. You need to talk to me. Are you hearing me, that you need to talk to me? Yes, Hung, I am. I need to talk more. We got a wrong row four. Got to go three, two, one, left. It's not looking good at all. This is tough. Gary, I got shiftage. - See? - Yeah, you can't shift them. - Bro. - You got to just stop. Let's go to the other. - Let's go to the other one. - Huh? - You want to go to the other one? - No. Damn it. Close. Detour. Oh, my God. Want to do the dance? We're gonna be doing the traditional - Paraguayan bottle dance. - Yeah. All right, let's go. Phil! Beautiful. Phil. Hey. Michelle and Victoria. You are team number two. What?! Oh, my God. Getting closer and closer to team number one. - Oh, my God. - Wait, we were second to last. I'm so proud of you for the dance thing. I'm so proud of you for that cello thing. Thank you. Spending time together's been awesome. - - And we fought... like, we've never, ever been this close in our lives. Nope. It's one of those realization things that we need each other, and it's been so awesome - and great so far. - Mm-hmm. You did really well today, you guys. Thank you, Phil. Yes! - We got to go. We got to go. - Thank you. - Gracias. Ooh. - Somebody might still be in there. Go, go, go. - Okay. - - Alfredo! - Alfredo! - Oh, they're... - Hey, guys, hey. Hey. Who's still in there? - No one. - Okay. - Good luck. - Thank you. - It's hard. - Be strong. You guys can do it! - I am so ready. - Me, too. I know that if I, like, break down, then it's not gonna do anything, and I'm just gonna get even more flustered. But this is the hardest freaking thing I've ever done in my entire life. And I literally never want to look at a cello again. And I just want to get it done. How did that happen? I don't know how the hell that happened. - Ready? - Yeah. Ready? You're good, you're good. - Check me. - Check! Ti prego. Sí. Sí. - Sí. Sí. Sí! Sí! - Sí. Sí. - Sí! Sí! - Sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. - - Yes, Riley! - What the heck, man? - Good job, guys! Nice job, guys. Damn, they beat us, Gary. I'm never eating watermelon again. Ever. This sucks, bro. - Uhp. - Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh. Leo and Alana, you are team number three. - - Yes! Oh, my God! Riley and Maddison, I am pleased to tell you that you are - team number four. Congratulations. - Yes. All right. I'm so happy I'm almost done. Oh, my God. Okay. - Gracias. - Thank you so much. Oh, my God. I thought that would never end. ...Thank you! Thank you, thank you. We're so close. We're so close. We just need to get this before the blondes get here. - Okay. - 'Cause they could be - really good. - Let's get out of here. Stay calm. Vámonos. Chee, that's beautiful. Check, please. Oh, okay, I see what you're saying. Damn it, D. Dude, this sucks, bro. This sucks so bad. Yeah, I think it looks right, Hung. - I think we got this, right? - I think so. Thank you, thank you... oh. Thank you. - Oh... oh, oh. Catch that, catch that. - Damn it, D. Catch it, catch it. Catch it. Hey. Bro, it's all right. Eswar and Aparna, I am pleased to tell you, you are team number five. What? - What the heck? - Dude. Hung and Chee, I am pleased to tell you that you are team number six. Wow. Okay, that's great. - You're still in it. - We'll take it. Absolutely. My lack of communication has been an issue for us since the day we met. You know, Hung keeps reminding me that the more I share, the closer we can get and the better we can be as a team. Dejected but not out. 'Cause you never know. You know, we didn't pay attention to detail like we should have. So we had a bunch of them sticking out and it didn't make that pyramid like this. It was more like this. And every time it would fall on us, I was like, "That sucks." All right, "Detour." - Dance. We're gonna dance. - We're gonna dance. All right, we're going "Use Your Melon." My dream is... - That everybody's stuck at the watermelons. - ...that somebody's stuck - at the watermelon challenge. - Like, one person. - This is it? In there? - ¿Aquí? ¿Aquí? All right, Haley, you ready? We got to move fast. We're gonna get it, Haley. We're gonna get it. Haley, you're crushing it. All right. We can do this! We can do this. From there, I have no idea what the hell we're doing wrong. The watermelons keep falling. It's getting dark. It's still hot. We have bugs coming out. Now we're super even more frustrated. This is killing me. You're not the only one it's killing. Oh, my gosh, we're here, we can do this, we can catch back up. The watermelon challenge could still be going on. No, no, no. We're close, we're close, we're close, we're close, - we're close! - Okay. Put one right there. - Where? - Right there in the middle. - Check. - Check. I'm done, Gary. Yeah. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. The last time we saw another team is when Hung and Chee left. - Yeah. - So, you know, hopefully... Yeah, that was probably two and a half hours ago. Today was the hardest day of my entire life. I'm pretty sure we're dead last. Hopefully, you know, we're lucky. - Right here? - Aquí, aquí. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. All right, gracias, amiga. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. Do you see Phil? Where is Phil? Come on, Gary. - I'm coming. - How do we get in here? Come on, Haley. We got to find Phil. Come on. How do we get into this place? All right, you can drop those bags. Yeah. I know it's over with for us, Phil. The watermelon stack was tough. It's been a fun Amazing Race. We've enjoyed South America. If there's one thing we know about you guys, you guys don't quit. - No, we don't. - And that's good, because you are not the last team to arrive. Oh,... - Are you serious? - I am serious. - Oh... Ooh... - So whatever drive you have left in you, you still get a chance to win this race. - Right? - I thought - for sure we were dead last. - Hey. We're good, we're good. - Somehow, some way... - Some... - ...who knows, but we came in seventh place. - No... Yes. As long as you're not last, - it's a win. - Yes. - Hi. - You're still smiling - after this long, long day? - Today was a day. - A long, long day. - So, would you be surprised to find out that you were last? - No. We know we're last. - No. You might be surprised to find out that this is a non-elimination leg. - Yes! Oh, my God. - Yes! - I'm so happy. - And it does mean that you have a second chance. - You're going to face a Speed Bump... - Speed Bump. - We're so happy about this, Phil. - ...in the next leg of the race, and you're going to need to complete that Speed Bump before you can continue racing with the other teams, so... - That's awesome. We love it. - We're still going! - We're really excited to keep going. - Thanks, Phil. We went into the race wanting to win, because my dad has been super sick for the past two years, and he's not getting the proper medical treatment because they can't afford it. So, for us to still be in this race gives us hope. And we want to make them proud. Next time on The Amazing Race, we head to Paris where Hung and Chee get a piece of the pie... Chee, I can't see. ...Riley and Maddison are off their game... We lost this. ...and Will and James... - ...try to shift gears. - Baby, we need to go. It's not working.
