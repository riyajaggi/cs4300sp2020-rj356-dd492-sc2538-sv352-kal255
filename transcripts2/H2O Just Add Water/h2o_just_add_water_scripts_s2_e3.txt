 ♪ I'm from the deep blue underworld ♪ ♪ Land or sea, the world's my oyster ♪ ♪ I'm the pearl ♪ ♪ No ordinary girl ♪ Impressive, lunatic! Glad you liked it. Miss me? Stop worrying. Last time Zane saw us, we were perfectly normal. And the time before that, we were mermaids! He's not gonna forget that. Then we'll just have to keep clear of water around him. -Same as we do with everyone. -Zane is not "everyone." When he wants something, he doesn't give up, like... Like what?

 Like you, for instance. What's he gonna do if he finds out we're mermaids? Are you sure you can trust him? Emma, I don't have to trust him. We broke up. That's where it's at. I thought it might be hard seeing him round again. Well, it won't be. If Cleo can handle breaking up with Lewis, I can handle keeping clear of Mr. Self-Absorbed, okay? ...which transmits the radio frequency to the solenoid array. It's all homemade. Barometric pressure sensors, temperature scales... It's pretty cool, huh? I'm taking weather measurements. -Can't you get that from the news? -Not like this. You don't get this precision from a news report. Okay, next question: why? Your new powers control the weather. -Right? -Right. So, to figure out what's going on, I need weather measurements to plot against the movement of the planets. -This is too weird, even for you. -Oh, come on, guys. It's all linked. The planets, the moon, the ocean, your powers. Lewis was just showing us his new weather device. Really? That's great. Right then, I'll get back to you. "I'll get back to you"? Like we're just friends. You are just friends. You dumped him. You did the right thing, Cleo. Our lives are way too complicated for guys right now. -Right? -Yeah. Right. [indistinct chatter] -Wow! -Oh, hey! [chuckles] Sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you. What are you working on? It's a device for getting information on the weather. I've got the Weather Channel at home. -Ah, I kinda like to do it myself. -Really? Me, too. So... Hm? Do you need a hand? -Yeah. Yeah, sure. Hold this. -Great. [motorcycle revving] ♪ I'm not just a girl Another bimbo with diamonds and pearls ♪ ♪ Hear me when I say ♪ ♪ I'm gonna break through And show you my way ♪ ♪ I'll show you where I stand You're gonna see me for all that I am ♪ ♪ It's time you see my destiny ♪ ♪ You know I'm ready to fight ♪ ♪ Ready to fight my way to the top ♪ ♪ You know I'm ready to fight ♪ ♪ Not gonna give up, not gonna stop ♪ ♪ You know I'm ready to fight My way to the top ♪ -Too slow again. -And I had you at that last turn, man. Sure, sure. Hey, wait here. -Couldn't keep away, huh? -[can opens] -Flattering yourself will get you nowhere. -[engines buzzing] It's good to see you again. -How's your new school? -Boring. All neat little uniforms, "dedicated to producing the leaders of tomorrow." -Wow, that sounds like you. -Zane, are we going or what? Later, Nate. -Life must be different for you. -What do you mean? Now that you're... normal. I like being a regular girl. I don't believe you. What? There's nothing regular about you. Here. On me. What's wrong? Not thirsty. I can't believe we both like apple and guava juice. I know! I heard it stimulates the scientific side of the brain. I heard it stimulates the artistic side. Maybe it does both. [Lewis] Or it just has a good PR machine. [Charlotte chuckles] You're very funny, you know that? I was reading this study that links high intelligence with a good sense of humour. -Oh, really? -Yeah, I think you'd be off the chart. Hey, Em, two apple and guava juices, please. [Emma] Coming up. -She seems nice. -Do you think? Sure. She's happy and friendly. She and Lewis seem to be getting on well. They do, don't they? -Hey, I'm sure nothing's going on. -Yeah, of course. She's just friendly. Just friendly. The way she flicks back her hair, that cute little smile, the way she laughs a little too hard, very friendly. I think we should investigate her. What? Lewis knows a secret of ours. She's trying to get close to him. -Who knows what she could find out? -Cleo. Come on. We don't know anything about her. It's time we did. [Lewis] I'm not sure if it's gonna be strong enough. It needs some kind of support structure, but preferably not metal. [Lewis] Yeah. So it doesn't interfere... [both] With the readings. It's so good to talk about this stuff with someone who actually understands science. [motorcycle revving] Hop on, come for a ride. -Maybe another day. -You're not afraid of me, are you? -Zane, it's not gonna happen. -Really? I can see it in your eyes. You want me back. No, I don't. It's over. Is that why you're still here? Okay. That's the way it's gonna be? Fine. Zane! Zane, are you okay? Zane! Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Zane? Help! Somebody! Zane! Are you alright? I knew you still liked me. Rikki! Rikki, come on! Rikki? Give me a juice. Is everything alright? You seem a little tense. -I'm not tense. Why should I be tense? -I thought you'd be here. -Make that to go. -Hear me out. I was messing around. You can trust me. Zane, get this into your head. No. Think about it. Trust him? Rikki, what have you said? Relax. He doesn't know anything. You were gonna stay away from him. I was. I mean, I am. Don't worry, he's gone. Good. And that's what you want, right? Definitely. [sighs] Come on, something's not right about her. Don't be so suspicious. You don't believe me? Take a look at this! I looked up Charlotte's old school. There's not even any mention of her name on the school records. Look, no Charlotte Watsford. No Charlotte anybody. You sure you've got the right school? This is serious. We have to tell Lewis before she gets her claws into him. You mean, before she finds out we're mermaids. Yeah, right. Before that. So, must be tough moving to a new school. Oh, what she means to say is, hi. Hi. Um, yeah, it has been a little bit hard, but everyone's really nice. Yeah, they are. Because people around here are generally very honest. -So you're into art? -Yeah. I was top at my old school in art. I'm into sketching, ceramics. -Even exhibited at a couple of galleries. -Really? Your old school must be really proud of you, then. I'm sure there's articles about you all over their school website. Well, actually there's probably not any record of me at all anymore. Why would that be? Just before I left, there was this huge fire. The office burned down, all the records were destroyed. Wow, that's interesting. A fire destroying all the school records? A little convenient, don't you think? Not really. Something like this must be mentioned on the school website. -[keying] -And... it's mentioned on the school website. "Work will start in the next few days on the new office block. The old one, which was destroyed by fire earlier this year..." Okay, there was a fire. "The fire, which was caused by a person or persons unknown, was started in the art room." -Cleo, you can't seriously-- -[Lewis] Charlotte. -You ready? -Yeah. All set. Lewis. -Hi. How's it going? -Fine. So, you've been hanging out with Charlotte. -Is everything okay? -Yeah. Everything's fine. -'Cause if there's a problem, we can talk. -There's no problem. Go. Have fun. Okay, then. "Go. Have fun." I'm such an idiot. Here's my masterpiece. Look at that. -What a piece of junk. -What? -She's into ceramics. -Oh, sure. She says that, Emma. But did that look like it'd make it into a gallery? Cleo, don't. Just leave it. Cleo? [Charlotte] I don't know what you think, but she's unstable. [Lewis] I agree. Totally unbalanced. -It's not surprising, given her shape. -No. [Lewis] I think I was the only thing keeping her together. The only thing keeping who together? Wanda, my weather and nautical data analyser. Last time I tried to set her up, she collapsed. She was a bit unbalanced. -"She" is? -Yeah. It's the shape. But then Charlotte made this ceramic stand and now she's rock solid. So, what are you doing out here? Just passing by. See? You can trust him. -You're gonna give this up now, right? -Right. There's nothing going on. Just put this all behind you. Okay. Someone left their diary here. You mean, Charlotte left her diary here. -This is where she was sitting. -Cleo, you definitely can't. I won't. I'll just put it safely behind the counter. I'll put it behind the counter. No, it's really best if I... -[thuds] -Oops. -Cleo. -My fault. RJ? "Meet RJ." RJ. Keep it running. I won't be long. [engine puttering] I've been thinking and there's a few things we need to get straight. If you've come here to tell me we can't possibly be together, I'll save you the trouble: we can't possibly be together. -Is that what you want? -No. [scoffs] What's the real problem? -Okay, but you've got to promise that-- -Come on. Can we go already? Yeah, in a minute, Nate. -Forget it. I should go. -No, no, no. Rikki, Rikki. Come on, I mean, you obviously wanna tell me something. -[Zane] Whoa! -[Rikki] Oh! [laughs] You idiot! What? It's only water! Help me. Get out of here now. Now! -It's my boat, Nate. Don't mess with it. -[Nate] What's the problem? Lighten up. Where'd she go? [footsteps approaching] I knew I'd find you here. It's okay. I'm alone. So now you know. Yeah, you're... -You're still a-- -A mermaid, Zane. I'm still a mermaid. That's what I meant. -Thanks for covering for me with Nate. -No problem. -You should have just told me. -Really? And what would you have said? What would you have done? I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you, but this time it's different. Come on, Rikki, just risk it. I don't care. About this. About everything. Let's get back together. Look, for a long time I was the only one around here who believed in mermaids. I can handle it. I wish I could believe you. Listen carefully. I can handle it. Believe me now? [Cleo] It's all here in the diary. RJ, RJ, RJ. -She's meeting him next week. -Alright. Maybe RJ is her boyfriend. -But isn't that a good thing? -What's that supposed to mean? Lewis and Charlotte are just friends. Look, Cleo, I know you still have feelings for him. But all this has to stop. And it will... right after Lewis finds out about RJ. [Charlotte laughing] You need to explain a few things. -I do? -Yep. Right now! -About what, exactly? -About everything. About how nothing with you seems to add up. -Like...? -Like... -RJ. -Have you been going through my diary? No! Well, I may have found it and it kind of fell open. And there was a photo. -It's there. You can admit it to Lewis. -[snickers] Why are you laughing? This photo is from my theatre group. We're doing Romeo and Juliet. "RJ." These meetings are rehearsals. Here. Anything else you need explained? No, that pretty much does it. [knocks on door] Kim! Someone's at the door! [knocking continues] Can I have a word? -I wanted to talk about today. -Lewis, forget it, please. No, no. Hear me out. All that stuff you said about Charlotte. I was thinking that maybe you were, and this is just a thought, that maybe you were a little jealous? Charlotte's just a friend, Cleo. Not like us. We're good friends. Yeah, I know. And if you've changed your mind about us, then, hey, just let me know. Lewis... I just wanted to find out more about her. If she's getting close to you, she's getting close to our secret. That's all? You're just protecting your secret? Yep. That's all. Okay. It's good to know where I stand. See you round. -Lewis, wait! -[door slams] Okay, there's two conditions to us getting back together. Number one, you have to keep our mermaid identity a secret. No problemo. What's the other catch? We don't let Cleo or Emma find out we're back together. Promise? -Promise. -Seriously. Okay. I promise. And we can't be seen together in public. You'll have to say goodbye to me here. You sure make a lot of rules, don't you? Okay, okay, I'll play it your way. You know where to find me.
