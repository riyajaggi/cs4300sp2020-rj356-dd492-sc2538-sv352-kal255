I don't think you need a screwdriver to say hello, Nate. I've always wanted one. -Well, just leave it, Nate. -Shut up, Zane. I can't believe you did that. I can't believe how boring you are these days. Hey! What's going on here? [motorcycle revving] [screwdriver clinking]

 Hey! You'll pay for this! [Zane] Rikki. What's wrong? That thing on your arm... what is it? -This? -Yes. It's a watch. And what do people normally use watches for? -You're mad because I'm late. -The boy is a genius. Anyone ever tell you you're cute when you're mad? That was fantastic, but it's not the same with just two of us. I know. Rikki's normally first in the water; She never misses our swims. She loves them. Where is she? -You did tell her? -Yeah. She said she was busy. She seems to have been busy a lot lately. Maybe she's got lots of homework or something. [scoffs] Rikki? Homework? You're hilarious. So, you wanna know why I was late? Not unless you grovel first and beg for my forgiveness. I got you this. -What is it? -Open it. ♪ I never thought I'd see the day That we would ever be... ♪ Zane, I can't accept this. Yes, you can. Look, I even made up a playlist for you. -Listen. -Seriously, Zane. Take it back and get a refund. No can do. You can't return them once they're engraved. You got it engraved? ♪ 'Cause things can only get better ♪ "Shut up and take the gift." If I take this, it'll mean we're, you know, a couple. -Or we could just be friends. -Right. Friends. Friends who go on dates. And... kiss sometimes. No, look, seriously. Take the gift. No strings attached, really. -But... -Repeat after me. "Thank you." -Thank you. -You're welcome. ♪ I know we see in different ways I know we'll never be the same ♪ Well, this is me. So, I'll see you tomorrow. -Don't I get to come in? -What for? You've met my dad. I wouldn't mind meeting yours. Um... Let's do that another day. -Why? I'm here now. -Yeah, but my dad's not. He's probably still at the office. But thank you for walking me and thank you for the gift. -Isn't that worth another kiss? -No strings attached, remember? How could I forget? See you tomorrow. -Nice place, by the way. -Thanks. -She's not even answering her phone. -Maybe we should drop by her house. -Have you ever been to her house? -No. Me neither. I feel like I've known her for ages and I still don't know anything about her. Hey, Zane. -Hi. -Have you seen Rikki? -Rikki? -You know, Rikki Chadwick. -About so high... -Blue eyes. -Blond, curly hair. -Kind of pale, pasty skin? Sorry, I can't help you. Check it out. The genuine article! No, no, no. No touching. Hand it over, Nate. -No way. It's mine now. -It's not yours. I'm taking it back. It was wasted on that old bucket of rust anyway, Zane. Trust me, the loser who owns it won't care anyway. I've asked you nicely. Now just grow up and give me the badge. [clears throat] Do we have a problem here, guys? Take your stupid badge. It's worthless anyway. Hey! -Charlotte, hi. -Think you'll be seeing Lewis today? I don't know. Maybe. Why? Is there-- He loaned me his jacket the other day and I haven't had a chance to give it back. -[chuckles] He's such a gentleman. -He is. Yeah. So, I was thinking if you would be seeing him, you could give it back for me? Can't you just give it back yourself? Oh, oh... -Okay, if it's a problem-- -It's no problem. It's fine. We'll give him the jacket. Thank you so much. I knew you'd understand. -You okay? -Me? I'm fine. Absolutely fine. I don't believe this. Back for more, you little vandal? -You don't understand. -I understand, sunshine. I've been working on this bike for months. Clear off before I call the coppers. Look, mate, if I wanted a piece of junk like this old thing, I'd buy one. -A new one. -Yeah, that'd be right. -A spoilt brat, that's what you are. -Take your stupid badge. The bike belongs at the wrecker's anyway. Don't come back. I might teach you some manners. [Zane] Loser. Alright, that'll do her. -You alright, sweetheart? -Yeah, Dad. Fine. Well, where's that beautiful smile your mum gave you? That's better. If that kid who vandalized Thelma ever shows his face around here again... [scoffs] I'm glad you don't hang around snobs like that, sweetheart. Hey, stranger. Long time no see. Where have you been hiding? Oh, you know, here and there. We've been here and there. Haven't seen you. Started to think you've found two other mermaids to hang out with. Listen, guys, I've got to go. -You just got here. -Sorry about that. What is with her? Rikki, wait! -Could you hold on a second? -I'm in a hurry. -What's with the attitude? -I don't wanna talk about it. Hey, people. What's happening? Hey, Lewis. Yeah. Right, well, I'll see you later. -See you. -See you. -So, what have I done? -Nothing. But you can have this back. -No. What's up with you? -Take it, Zane. I don't want your stupid, expensive gift. Just leave me alone. -What's going on with Rikki and Zane? -What do you mean? I just saw them together, and they had that "something's going on" vibe. That reminds me, Lewis. Charlotte said to give you this. Oh! Um... You know, Rikki did seem a little edgy when Zane walked in. Maybe there is something going on with them. [doorbell buzzes] [man] Yes? Is Rikki home? Who? You must be Rikki's dad. Must I? Aren't you? I'm afraid not. [stammers] I'm Zane, a friend of Rikki's. Is she here? Look, there's no Rikki at this address. Sorry. [engine puttering] [Terry] Come on, Thelma. -[engine not starting] -Oh, come on. -[engine putters, stops] Come on, Thelma. -[engine putters] -[groans] [sighs] I've been working on that for a year and I still can't get it started. Coffee? You don't have to wait on me, Rikki. But since you're offering... Thanks, love. [sighs] Sweetheart, I've been thinking... You know you're welcome to bring your friends around. Yeah. Of course. Um, it's not exactly the Ritz, but... It's our little world, Dad. You, me, and Thelma. Exactly how I like it. I love you. -Hey. -Oh, hey there. -Did you get your jacket back? -Yep. -Yeah, uh, about that... -Is something wrong? -I gave it back to Cleo. -Here's the thing. Uh, next time, could you maybe... not? -Oh, I hope I didn't cause any problems. -You didn't. It's just, it would've been better if you had given it back to me directly. I assumed that since you guys are close friends... It's fine. It's just... I just thought I'd mention it. Uh, for next time. [sighs] Rikki. Not now. What's going on with you? -What are you talking about? -You're being weird. -You're weird all the time. -You don't live where you said you lived. Oh, what, so you're stalking me now? -Have I done something to make you mad? -Leave it alone, Zane. -No, wait-- -No, Zane! -We need to talk about this. -No, we don't. I don't think Rikki would make the same mistake twice. [doorbell rings] Maybe she doesn't see Zane as a mistake. Speak of the devil. Zane. -[door closes] -[Zane] Hi, guys. I'm worried about Rikki. -Did something happen? -The details aren't important. But she took off in the water. You know, fish style. -You mean, you know about... -Yes, I know. And no, I don't care. Can you just find Rikki and make sure she's okay? Rikki. Rikki, are you alright? [sniffles] Fine. What's happening? -Don't go tough guy on us. -I don't know what you're talking about. -Well, Zane said-- -You spoke to Zane? -He was really worried about you. -How long has he known? I was going to tell you. Look, I'm not saying I think it's a good idea, you and him. But he was really worried about you. I just... -We're just so... -So...? So different. It doesn't matter if you're different. But if you can't be yourself around him, you've got the problem. Hi. I'm sorry for prying. And I'm sorry that you find it so hard to let people in. So I get it now. No more pushing. I'll leave you alone if that's what you want. Okay, then. Fine. You wanna know all about me? Fine. This is where I live. And that guy you abused yesterday? -That's my dad. -Your dad? That "piece of junk" you vandalized just for fun? -That's his bike. -I didn't do anything to the bike. -It was Nate. -Whatever. You've got the perfect excuse not to be interested in me now, so just go. Rikki, wait. I don't care that you live here. Why do you find it hard to believe that someone could be interested in you? I mean, regardless of where you live, Rikki... I like you. I mean, I really like you. Really? Really. What the blazes do you think you're doing? -I can explain. -Dad, please-- -Quiet, Rikki. -Dad, please! I said quiet. Listen, I don't know what's going on here, but I don't want the likes of you near my daughter. So you get lost and don't ever come back! Now!

I was trying to bring it back. He's telling the truth. So, we're square? Yeah, yeah. We're square. -I'm Zane, by the way. -You can call me Terry, mate. Now, can you tell me how you fixed me bike? Listen, I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong. Lewis... The only reason I gave Charlotte my jacket was because she was cold and she asked me. Lewis, I really don't care. And what was I supposed to say, hmm? No? -I don't get what the big deal is-- -It's not a big deal! -Oh, I just-- -Lewis. Trust me. Drop it. Okay, I can take a hint. Hey. -Hey. -Hey.
