Mum used to make it so much better. Hey, you don't like it, make your own breakfast. Ah, my two sweet, perfectly mannered daughters, I need your help. -What do you think? The check or the blue? -The blue. Interesting. I would've thought the red would bring out my rugged complexion. By the way, if you wanted to impress someone, would flowers or chocolates be best? -Dad, what's going on? -What do you mean? You work on a fishing boat.

 Why wear one of your best shirts? And what's with the flowers and chocolate? It never hurts to impress, Cleo. Gotta run. He couldn't be. -Could he? -[door closes] [Don] All that stuff in the back, I want that all just neat and tidy. -Yeah, all that-- -Dad! You forgot your lunch. Cleo. Thanks, but I'm going out to lunch today. Fancy restaurant, silver service, the whole bit. Wow, that's... unusual. Yeah. You don't think this aftershave's too much? -I haven't worn it in years. -No, it's... it's fine. Dad, is there anything you want to tell me? All in good time, Cleo. All in good time. I better get going. I got work to do. Go on, off you go. Yeah, just tidy all that stuff up there, too, okay? Yeah, all that. [Don] That's good. -Hello! -How are you? Very, very good. Where's those flowers? -For you, ma'am. -Oh, you're so sweet. Oh, they're beautiful! [water splashes] Here you go, ma'am. Going fishing, Lewis? Ah, it's more than fishing, Wilfred. It's about hunting your own food. Man against beast. It's a battle of survival. Uh, could I grab a couple of jam muffins to go? Sorry, all out. -You need my help. -Charlotte, hi. You always go fishing Saturday mornings, so... -I brought you some food. -Wow. Great. I hope you've got enough fishing gear for two. -I never knew you were interested. -Are you crazy? I love fishing. I go all the time. Yeah, okay. Come on. One night, I spent seven hours locked in an epic battle with this two-kilo salmon. It was like a game of chess. But I got my man. I mean, fish. What about you? Hmm? -What have you caught? -This and that. Try the mini-quiche. [Lewis] Okay. -Mm. They're good. -Made them myself. Really? Wow. Smart and talented. Ow! -Oh! Let me see. -No, it's fine. Charlotte, let me help. Ah, it's not too bad. At least we know it's sharp enough to catch fish. There. All done. Thanks. I don't know what came over me. I'm usually very careful with those fishhook things. Uh, they're called lures. I made these ones myself. -Lures, yeah, that's what I meant. -[scoffs] You don't know anything about fishing, do you? I'm so busted. I'll be honest with you, Lewis. I really just wanted to ask you to come out with me tonight. I've gotta go to this thing with my mum, and... Thank you so much for the offer, but I'm kind of busy right now. -Some other time, though? -Oh, yeah. Right. Well, I don't think these fish are biting. We might call it a day. Looking for this? Cleo. What are you doing? Nothing. I just felt like a swim... -Is everything alright? -Yeah. No, not really. It's my dad. He's-- -[Charlotte] Lewis, should I pack up? -Yes. That would be great, thank you. -You were saying? -What is she doing here? -She's just fishing. -At our old fishing spot? Come on, Cleo. We're just hanging out. Cleo. Cleo. Uh, Lewis, I think you've got a bite. -Aren't you going to get that? -I'm not sure if I should. [reel splashes] Mm. I think that's the one that got away. I'm glad you're home. Cleo, come. Sit. We need to have a family discussion. I've got something very important to tell you both. -Now, recently-- -You've met someone. Dad, I saw her today down by the boat. -I know what's going on. -You do? Oh! In that case, I guess it's not that much of a surprise. Her name's Annette. I'm sorry I haven't mentioned the whole thing earlier, but I wanted to make sure it was gonna work out before I said anything. So, I want you to be really nice to her, make her feel welcome. Make her feel welcome? She's coming here for dinner... tonight. [both] Tonight? But, Dad, I have plans with Emma and Rikki. [Cleo] We're going out tonight. Cleo, this is much more important than some night out with your friends. Come on, girls. You should be happy for me. This could be the start of something big. [groans] -This is bad, Kim. -How bad? Stepmother bad. [sighs] First, Mum leaves, then I break up with Lewis, now this. -I don't know what to do. -I do, blow them all off. -Rikki. -Come on, Cleo. [Rikki] The coral reef is spawning tonight. -You've been looking forward to this. -Yeah, I know. It only happens once a year. You can't miss this. It would make you feel better. I'm sorry. I have to be there, for Dad. Come on, guys. I told you to clean up in here an hour ago. -I'm doing it. -It's that late? Oh, no. I should've started cooking half an hour ago. It's okay, Dad. I've got it under control. Great. We're having fish. They're going to be here any minute. -[doorbell rings] -They? Who's "they"? -[Don] Welcome. -[Annette] Hi, Don. Come on in. May I introduce Annette Watsford and her daughter Charlotte? You? You? -You two know each other? -Yeah. We know each other, alright. [Don] Fantastic! Huh! This is going to be great! Thank you two girls for having us at such short notice. Thank you. Don has told me so much about you. That's odd because he hasn't said much about you at all. -[laughs] -[Annette] Oh! I have something for you. Don said they're your favourite band. The Dysfunctionals! Alright. Thanks. -Uh, you can call me Annette. -Thanks, Annette. You're the best. Kim can have mine. I'm a bit old for that band. So, I bet you two have a lot in common. You have no idea. That's good, because from now on, you'll be seeing a lot more of each other. -Hopefully. -Wow, that's just great. [knocks on door] I'll get it. I'm sure you have lots to talk about. Fashion and music. -[door opens] -Boys. [chuckles] -What do you want? -I need to see Cleo right now. Cleo-- Charlotte? [both] Lewis? Lewis? The Lewis? The Lewis you're always talking about? [scoffs] This is so embarrassing. Okay, back up a second. Um... What's going on here? I have been wanting to meet you for some time, Lewis. You have? That's sweet. -Who are you? -Oh! Charlotte's mother. -Okay, um, maybe I better go. -Oh, no. He can stay, can't he? Oh, fine by me. There's plenty of food. No, you don't have to do that. And, Dad, you really don't have to do that. Nonsense. The more, the merrier. Right, Lewis? [Annette chuckles] What are you doing here, Lewis? I wanted to explain what happened with Charlotte. -Not that anything was happening. -[sighs] But if you thought that something was, then, I'm here to make sure everything's perfectly clear. Oh, it's clear! Even Charlotte's mother seems to know what's going on. Cleo, there is nothing going on with me and... Charlotte! Hi, we were just-- Talking about me. I understand. You better get back in there, though. Your dad seems to be getting anxious. He won't stop talking about fish. [sighs] A lot of people confuse the coral cod for the coral trout. It's an easy mistake to make. But I find the trout a much more personable fish. [laughs] -Better-looking, too. -[Annette chuckles] Ah, Cleo! She's been such a great help around the house. Even made dinner. [coughs] Sorry, Dad. With everything going on, I just got distracted. Oh, can I help? I happen to be quite handy in the kitchen, right, Don? -[sighs] That's a great idea. -Charlotte, can you give me a hand? Sure. Lewis likes my cooking. Don't you, Lewis? See? Isn't this better than hanging out with your friends? I never thought cooking could actually be fun. Getting everyone involved is the key. Cleo isn't doing anything. Someone needs to supervise. I could use a little help, Lewis. Uh, I think I'd just prefer to... just to watch. Oh, you're so cute. Charlotte told me you were shy. Come on, she won't bite. I think I forgot to wash my hands. -Cleo, please-- -I don't want to hear it, Lewis. You've got to believe me. Nothing is going on. Cleo, can you bring me the flour? [sighs] Ow! Sorry. Cleo! Cleo! [knocks on door] Whoever it is, go away! What do you want? -I came to apologise. -Forget it, it's just some flour. No, not about that. About this dinner thing. I didn't realise Don was your dad. I never would have come if I did. -So, you knew about my dad and your mum? -Sure. It's no big deal. She's done this kind of thing before. Oh, really? Well, if you don't mind, I want to be alone right now. Can we talk about Lewis? I know that you used to go out, but... we've been spending some time together... Yeah, I've noticed. So, I was wondering if that was going to be a problem. Lewis and I are just friends. Excellent. That was the most amazing thing I have ever seen! Totally. I wish Cleo would have been there. -[phone ringing] -Yeah. Cleo. What? No way. We've got an emergency. [Annette] These shellfish look superb, Don. Caught them myself. On my boat, we only go for the best. It's all top produce. [doorbells rings] -I'll answer it. -No, it's best I go. -You stay here and keep the girls company. -Yeah, keep us company, Lewis. Come on, you two. [doorbell rings] Girls? Sorry. Cleo's a little busy tonight. -We won't be long, Mr. Sertori. -[Annette] Closer. Oh! This certainly is a memorable evening. Lewis. Guys! Hi. We're just, um... Don't they look sweet? -How could you, Lewis? -How could I what? Come on, let's find Cleo. Smile. Here! Oh, that's perfect! -I can't go back down there. -You don't have to. We'll say you're not feeling well and wait for them to leave. Are you kidding? You're just going to lie down and take this? Let that woman steal your dad and let her daughter hit on Lewis without putting up a fight? -What can I do? -You're a mermaid! You've got some serious kick-butt superpowers. They don't know who they're dealing with. Come on. Am I right? Yeah! You're right. Let's do this! Need any help? Girls, you're gonna love this. Annette's secret family recipe. It's delicious. So sweet! Not as sweet as you, Don. Thank you! [screams] -Oh! -Oh, no, the sauce! -[Annette] It's ruined! -[Charlotte] Don't worry. We've still got one of your beautiful fish in the oven for mains. [Annette groans] Hold on. [stammering] It's frozen solid! -[Don] Did you turn the oven on? -[Annette] Of course! [Don] I'd better check it. Guys, whatever you think you're doing, it has to stop. We don't know what you're talking about, Lewis. I see. This is about Charlotte, isn't it? Fine. I'm going to sort this out right now. Charlotte, you and I have had some good times so far... -We have? -Yes. And things seem to have taken a new direction lately. -You think? -Definitely. And it's not that I don't like you. -I do-- -You do? I knew it! Cleo, this isn't what it looks like. It's working now. Please, Cleo... It won't take long as long as we can get it defrosted. -Charlotte, can you get more marinade? -Sure, Mum. My fish is in safe hands. [shrieking] Maybe we could just call out for pizza? [sighs] If this is the way you do business, you can count me out. I'm sorry. Please. You'll have to come back another time. -Don, I'll be straight with you. No! -Okay. [door closes] You should go, too, Lewis. Okay. You didn't have to do that, you know. It's alright, Dad. If she really loves you, she'll come back. Loves me? -What are you talking about? -You and Annette. Aren't you getting married? What? Annette is a business partner. She was here to inspect my fish to buy for her restaurant. -She's a chef? -Yes. There's nothing going on. [Don] And certainly not now. She wouldn't want anything to do with me. I've lost the biggest deal of the year. This stuff went everywhere. -How did it explode like that? -No idea. I think I'd better get someone in to check that stove. And the oven. And the sink. Dad, I want to apologise about last night. Don't be silly. I'm the one who should apologise. I was so worried about making that deal, I gave you the wrong impression about Annette. You two must have been freaking out. No, we're fine about it, really. We were freaking out. Let me get one thing clear. You two are the only women in my life. Okay? Yeah. Okay. Now give your dad a hug. [Cleo] How could I get it so wrong? You might have been wrong about your dad, but Lewis is still a little worm. No, forget about Lewis. I'm over him. No, really. I broke up with him. I understand if he wants to find someone else. -Even if that someone else is Charlotte? -Yep. It's his choice. It's an incredibly dumb choice, but it's still his choice. -So, what about your dad? -I'm gonna need your help on that one. [Rikki] How do I look? Do you actually think this is going to work? Well, we're about to find out... I got your call. What is all this about? Oh, that's impressive. Firm and fresh. Where did you get it? From Don Sertori. The freshest fish in town. I'm sorry about last night. It was an accident. Forgive us? Well, this is just the sort of produce my restaurant needs. You bet it is. You tell Don to give me a call. I'm sure we can do business. -Going fishing? -Yeah. And no, you can't come. Look, we should... we should get something straight between us. -Last night-- -It's okay. You're not ready to move on. I know. It's just, my life's pretty complicated right now. -It's okay, Lewis. -It is? Yeah, sure. I can wait. Yeah. That's great. -[Cleo] Thanks for coming, Annette. -[Annette] Thank you. I've got to go. I'll talk to you later.
