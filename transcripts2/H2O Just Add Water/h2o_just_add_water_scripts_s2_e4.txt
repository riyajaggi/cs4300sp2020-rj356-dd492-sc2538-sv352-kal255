You can relax at my place for the whole weekend. -My parents are going away. -Where to? A crystal-ware convention. My mum collects figurines. You know, the worst part about that is that I'm not even surprised. -How about it? -[Cleo] I can't stay over. Dad's working and I have to look after Kim. What about you, Rikki? A sleepover in my jim-jams? You're kidding, right? -Yeah, it's not really Rikki's scene. -Then again,

 you've got cable, widescreen TV, hot and cold running snacks. -Why not? I'll be there. -[Cleo] Excellent. All fixed. What? Listen, my parents like order. This house runs like a well-oiled machine. They don't like people who mess around. Who's messing around? Hey, Lise. Thanks for having me stay. Well, it's my pleasure, Rikki. You're always welcome. Thanks! So, what's in the box? My latest acquisition from Casa Cristal. I'm sure Emma's told you I'm a very keen collector. She has, but I'm not gonna hold it against you. What do you think? It's the jewel in the crown of my collection. -Mum, it's-- -Absolutely hideous. But I guess that's what makes it art, right? [laughs] [bird squawking] [footsteps approaching] [Nate] Ah... Packed up on you, eh? No. I'm just making improvements to make it more efficient. Had spare time on your hands since you broke up with Cleo? Yeah, a bit. [Nate] It's probably a good thing you guys split. -People were starting to talk. -What about? Oh, about you. You've been around girls so long, you were beginning to act like one. [laughs] Well, that's ridiculous. -Ah! Paper cut. -Oh, paper cut. Toughen up, Lewis. Oh, come on. It stings. [Cleo] Lewis, you know why we broke up. My life's too complicated for a boyfriend right now. -[groans] I can never get this. -Here. -So there's no other reason? -What other reason? -To do with me? Like whether I'm... -Whether you're what? Manly enough for you. There, you happy? Manly? -Lewis, are you feeling alright? -Yes, I'm fine. Look at that. Mine are a complete mess. Where'd you learn to fold so neatly? Me? It's from constantly folding sails down at the docks. And other things that men tend to fold. I've gotta go. -[yelling] -Hey, Nate. [Lewis] Bad time? -Yes, Lewis? -What was that you were doing? Naihanchi. It's a kata. -It's cool. -The girls like it. -That's not why I do it. -No, of course not. No. I do it for discipline, focus, and to attain a oneness between mind, body and spirit. You wanna learn? I don't wanna bother you. I might find an online course. -Silence. -Okay. Attention. Lower strike, off hand, front kick! Hyah! It's your turn. Left strike, right punch, pizza slice, kick! [screams] You could be really good at this stuff. You can practice with me. Be here at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow morning. We'll make a man of you yet, Lewis. I'm so glad you're here to keep Emma company for the weekend, Rikki. You know what they say, Mum, two responsible heads are better than one. -So, when are you leaving? -In the morning. Great. That gives us two days. What can we squeeze into that, Em? Three wild parties? Maybe four? [laughs] Oh, Rikki. Come on, darling, let's go and pack. What's up? Yuck. Rikki. [Rikki] This is gonna be so tasty. -Mess everywhere. -It's alright. It's meant to do that. What are you doing? Morning, Emma. We're making breakfast. -Where's Mum and Dad? -They left first thing this morning. Yep, we are officially on our own. So, do you want one piece of French toast or two? What I want is for you to clean the egg off the bench. -And the floor. -Yeah, we'll get to that after breakfast. You can't eat that. It's total junk. Em, lighten up. Yeah, lighten up. I wish my sister could be more like you. -You wanna take a break? -No! No way. I'm... I'm fine. You're out of shape, man. Take a breath. [Lewis panting] -Oh, goodness. -So, what do those girls get up to? Huh? Emma, Cleo and Rikki. They all look really fit. Yeah, well, I guess they get plenty of exercise. Right. So, Cleo's the sporty type? Definitely not, no. No, Cleo's a real girly girl. She likes flowers and chocolates, all that stuff. There's a beginner's class this afternoon. You wanna come? -Sure. -Excellent. -See you later. -See you then! Emma, I've been looking for you everywhere. What's up? Nothing's up. Why would something be up? It's Rikki. She's turned my house into a pigsty and my brother against me. What? Don't you think I'd like to slack off and lay around the house once in a while? I can't because it would... Would what? Look, maybe you should just... relax and go with the flow. You think I can't go with the flow. -You think I'm too tense, too rigid. -That's not what I-- You wait. You'll see. I'll show you who can relax. I'll show everyone. Hey, look what someone just dropped off for you. For me? Who'd send someone like you flowers? "For the hottest chick around." "Hottest chick"? Who'd write something like that? You've got to admit, that was the greatest save you've ever seen. Absolutely... for a shrimp. Whoa. Hi. [scoffs] Uh, Emma, what's for dinner tonight? I'm having it. You guys do what you like. You call that dinner? You don't like it? Grab something else. Okay, we will. -Wanna go to the juice bar? -[Elliot] Yeah, alright! Wicked. [yells] Down left! Right kick! -Hey, mate, are you alright? -Yeah. [woman counting in Japanese] [Lewis panting] [woman] Ah! [grunts] -Thanks, man. -Nah, you did really well. See what you've been missing hanging out with girls? Yeah. -How you feeling? -Great. Great. I feel very, um, very Bruce Lee. [laughs] Alright. [exhales sharply] You gonna tag along with us? Mm... Don't know if I can be bothered. -It's not gonna work, you know. -What? This. Admit it. You're trying to be something you're not. You don't know me at all, do you? You think so? -I know so. What? You're the only one who can be a rebel? Oh, I get it. You think sitting around eating pizza makes you a rebel? Well, it doesn't. A real rebel would throw the biggest, baddest party as soon as her parents were out of the house. Whatever. Go on, make a mess. Toss it on the floor. So, what's up with Emma? She's trying to prove she's a rebel. The house is a total wreck. Really? I think that might be my fault. I kind of encouraged her to let her hair down. Yeah, well, she's trying way too hard. Hey, Cleo, someone left this for you. For me? Who? Sorry, didn't see. Must be keen on you, though. "Sweets for the sweetest girl." If the chocolates don't make you sick, the card will. Lewis. Are you sure? It's a little thoughtful for Lewis. He's been acting really weird, asking me questions, whether I think he's manly enough. -Manly? -That's what I thought. Everything alright? Mm, I had my first karate lesson this afternoon. And you got taken out. What do you mean? It was great. I was great. Lewis, this whole macho thing doesn't suit you. You're just not a physical kind of guy. Cleo, I'm making some serious changes. From now on, my body, it is my temple. -Chocolate? -Love one. Oh! Mm... Expensive. And by the way, thanks for the flowers. Flowers? -Someone sent you flowers? -Come on, Lewis, I know it was you. Someone sent you flowers? What, and chocolates? You know, they are a little bitter and I wouldn't have any more if I were you. Call it a hunch, but I don't think he's your secret admirer. [loud dance music playing] What's that noise? That, Elliot, is the sound of someone trying too hard. [women chattering] -Hey, just in time for the party! -Party? Mum's not gonna like this. Mum's not gonna know about it, right? Who are these people? Friends. And friends of friends. What's going on? Who are all these people? Not you, too. Don't ask questions, just get into it. Hey, you know what this party needs? -Boys! -[girl 1] Boys! -[girl 2] Yes! -[girl 3] Good idea. [indistinct chattering] [phones beeping] [phone beeping] A party! Cool. Nate. Oh, Lewis, you've come back for more. The next class is more advanced, but I think you can handle it. -Really? -Yeah. You're a natural. You'll have them running scared. That's great, man, because I just found out some guy has been sending Cleo presents, and I just wanna... I wanna find him and straighten him out. Really? Are you sure she's not doing it herself to make you jealous? Why would she do that? Oh, Lewis, think about it. You're a whole new guy. -She's worried girls are gonna notice it. -You think so? Yeah. And you know what you should do? Cut her off. Ignore her. That will only make her want you more. -Ignore her? -Trust me. Oh, and... -Enjoy the class. -I will. Okay. [dance music pounding] Let me try. Hey! Great party. Booyah! What are you doing here? I got the text and figured this party would need life. Hey, Nate! Come in. Enjoy the party! Hey, Emma. I brought along some mates. No, that's... a lot of people. Sorry. Restricted area. No access. Go on! [glass shattering] Take over. Yeah, I guess I'm pretty hot... at karate, too. I'm not officially a teacher yet, but I'm one of the leaders because I'm so good. Wanna see? -Uh, I don't think there's enough room. -No, it's fine. Hey! What are you doing? [man shouting karate calls] -Worried yet? -What? No, what have I got to be worried about? -It's just not you, you know? -What? This. Being rebellious. You're just trying to act like me. You know what your problem is? You think you're the only one who can do what you like. Well, you're not. [yelling] Wicked. Pretty cool, huh? -Yeah, it's very sweaty. -Yeah. Well, all that tough macho stuff is fun, but it's only one side of me. There's also the sensitive, romantic side that sends flowers and chocolates. That was you? [chuckles] And I've got something else for you. It's for your wallet. So I'm with you... always. I'm speechless. Well, maybe that's because the time for speaking is over. Hey. -Oh, very clever, Nate. -Lewis, what are you talking about? You set me up. You distract me with this karate junk. You pretend to help me while you move in on Cleo? -You came to me, buddy. -What are you talking about? Stay out of this, Cleo. This does not concern you. It's just about you. Oh, Lewis, you need to cool off. [soda lid pops] [screams] Come on! Quick, get in the tub. [laughing] Okay, karate boy, let's see who the real man is. -Are you serious? -Deadly. Guys, this is silly. I don't wanna be fought over. Alright, this is over. I'm kicking these losers out. No. This is my house and my party, and I'll say when it's over. Emma, give it up. What are you trying to prove? That I'm not boring, okay? I can have fun, too. Guys, this is ridiculous. Stop it! The dolphin! That didn't sound good. Out of my way. Move! Come on, guys, get out of the way. Alright, everyone, party's over. Clear out! Get out! -Move it! -[man] Emma! Rikki? [woman] What is going on here? [Emma] I'm sorry, Mum. We owe you a new one. You owe me an explanation. Rikki, I just don't understand this. You were a guest in this house. Why did you do this? -Mum-- -Em. It's alright. I'm sorry. I didn't think about the consequences. I guess I'm just irresponsible. Oh, well, these things happen and there's not much that we can do about it now. Hopefully, you have learned something from Emma over the past couple of days. Oh, I have. Thanks for having me. Wait. It was all my fault, not Rikki's. She's lying to protect me. She told me the party was a bad idea. I'm the irresponsible one. I let things get out of hand. It was all me. Is this true? But, Emma, that's not like you. Yeah, that was the point. Still on the health kick, I see? Um, let's just say I wasn't getting the results I was looking for. Lewis, you know, when we were together, it wasn't because you were tough. It was because you were a great guy. I mean, are a great guy. -Really? -Yeah. I should go. See you round. See you round. Grounded for two weeks. That's harsh. Actually, I'm rapt. Why? Because in my parents eyes, I'm a rebel. Isn't that great? [both laugh] What?
