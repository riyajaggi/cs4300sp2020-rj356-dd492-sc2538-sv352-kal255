[gasps] -That's the best report you've ever had. -I'm almost the best in my year. If Lucy Robertson got hit by a bus, I'd be the top of the class. Cleo, you should hear how well Kim did in her exams. [Kim] I did a lot better than you when you were my age. You can tell me later. Didn't you have a biology exam last week? You should have the results back by now.

 -I'm getting them next week. -That's not true. Seniors already have their results. -I heard them talking. -I'm going out. See you later. This is a whole new feeling for me. I could really get used to it. -Get used to what? -Academic success. C+ for biology. Not too shabby. -That's great. -How about you? A+. -That's not possible. -You could, too, if you studied. Yeah, if I didn't have a life, or I was some kind of geek study slave. No offence. Is this all you two talk about? You're so competitive. Who cares anyway? Did I say something wrong? -Hey, Cleo. -Lewis, hi. How did you go with your biology exam? -Life isn't all about exams, Lewis. -Not so good, huh? Hey, I was thinking, um... if you want me back... as a study partner, of course, just give me a call, anytime. I'll keep that in mind. [dolphin laughing] There you are. We've been looking for you. Sorry, guys. I'd really like to be alone. -Did we say something to upset you? -No. Come on, Cleo. Spit it out. I failed biology. Hey, I'm sure it's not that bad. It's my worst result ever, in anything. [Emma] Everyone has a bad day. Last year, I got my worst result ever and I lived. It's not because I had a bad day. It's because I didn't have Lewis around. We always used to study together. -Why don't you give him a call? -That'd just confuse everything. We're friends now and it just has to stay that way. You really need to get out more, Lewis. Charlotte. Hey. -How's it going? -Good. Can't believe you're studying on such a great day. I'm fine, really. Hey, I just had this fabulous idea. Why don't you take me out on your boat? [chuckles] -Right now? -Yeah. I need some more artwork for my mid-year folio, and I'm looking for the perfect place to paint. Charlotte, I'm so sorry, I can't. I have study to do. Biology? You don't study biology. You do physics and chem. I just need to brush up on it. Sometimes I help other students to study. Like who? Like Cleo, actually. She should be calling me any minute. That's not a problem, is it? No, of course not. Why would that be a problem? [Don] Ta-da! [phone ringing] I'll get it. Hello? Dad. It's Cleo's biology teacher. He doesn't sound very happy. Hello, Mr. Hamm. I see. I see. Where have you been? Just out with Emma and Rikki. Maybe that's the problem. What do you mean? I think there might have to be a few changes around here. Less socializing, for starters. Your biology teacher rang. Sorry, Dad. I was going to tell you. -Cleo, you can always talk to me. -Yeah. -We wouldn't have laughed at you, much. -Kim! The good news is Mr. Hamm and I have come up with a solution. He's agreed to let you sit a supplementary exam on Monday. -Really? -There's more. He suggested a study partner to help tutor you over the weekend. -Well, I guess I'll call Lewis, then. -Well, there's no need. Mr. Hamm's already had a student volunteer to help. [doorbell ringing] Starting tonight. You're gonna love this. Charlotte? -What are you doing here? -I'm your new tutor. [Charlotte] I'll go over it once more. So in mitosis, the parent cell makes a copy of each chromosome and these copies are called sister chromatids, but together, they're considered one chromosome. I will never understand that. [sighs] Come on, Cleo. I know this is hard for you, but you'll get it. Eventually. Look, after the cell divides, each chromatid is considered to be a chromosome in its own right. -Got it? -Yeah, got it. Actually, I don't. Can you explain it again? [sighs] Okay, here's what I want you to do. Read everything from page 39 to 114 and do the exercises on page 80. Then complete the questions on page 210. Are you kidding? -That will take me hours. -You wanna pass, don't you? Yeah, well, I'd like some sort of life as well. Cleo, if you really want to do this, you're going to have to study for the rest of the weekend. -All of it? -All of it. Call me if you need anything. [sighs] Been burning the midnight oil, Cleo? Good work. -[doorbell rings] -Keep reading. I'll get that. -Morning, girls. -Morning. -We're here to see Cleo. -She's having breakfast. I have to ask you to keep your visit brief. -Cleo has a big study day today. -[sighs] Hey, what's up? Cleo has a tutor. Charlotte. -Charlotte? -Are you serious? Well, lucky we're here to rescue you. -We're going shopping. Wanna come? -I wish. I'm under house arrest. I've got about three years of study to do, courtesy of Charlotte. Sorry. Time to go, girls. Bye. [shushes] [Don] Bye. All done? Oh. Yep. I've read everything there is to know about biology. Levels 11 and 12. Great, so you're free? Uh, I'm still expecting a call. Too bad. I was thinking of drawing today and taking you on a picnic. Chicken wings, mini pizzas. Those little chocolate soufflés you like so much. So, why don't you turn your phone off and come with me? -I shouldn't, really. -Come on. It's a shame to waste such a beautiful day. Lewis. Don't you think that if Cleo needed your help, she would've called you by now? [phone beeps] Oh, this is such a great spot. -We're gonna have so much fun. -Sure. I know I will. Well, that's good. That's good. Why don't you come sit next to me, make yourself comfortable? Soon. I should, um, check if my phone can get a signal out here. [paper rustling] -[knocking on door] -[Don] How's it going? Okay. I'm getting there. I'm very proud of you. Thanks, Dad. It's been such a great day. -Don't you think? -Yeah. It's been fun. It's really nice with just the two of us. We should do it again sometime. Hey, I wanna show you something. My grandma left me all of this when she died. Some paintings of hers in here as well. Hmm. -Mako Island. -What? Nothing, I thought I recognised something. -It's not important. -Yeah, it is. Do you know where this is? Is this Mako Island? Ooh! Maybe. I don't know. It could be anywhere. I'm probably wrong. But I've been looking for this place. I wanna paint it just like Grandma. Can you take me there? Not today. It's getting too late. What about tomorrow? Please? For me? [doorbell rings] -Mr. Sertori. I'm here for tutoring. -Of course, Charlotte. Please come in. I think Cleo's in the bath. Oh, I don't mind waiting. Why don't you just go on up and tell her you're here? Thanks, Mr. Sertori. [door closes] Hi, Cleo, it's Charlotte. I'm here for your study session. -You're early. -Take your time. Stay there. I'll be right out. [door opens] What are you doing with my locket? Oh, sorry, I just saw it there and it's beautiful. Have you had it for long? Awhile. Looks exactly the same as the lockets that Rikki and Emma wear. Yeah. We all got them at the same place. -Did you finish everything? -Everything. Didn't get much sleep, though. Yep. Yep. -These all seem to be in order. -Great! -Oh, I'm done. -Not yet. The last part of the exam is an essay question. You need to write a practice one. -Three thousand words. -What? I haven't been out of the house all day. -There goes the rest of my weekend. -Come on, Cleo. Just think how good you'll feel when you pass. Uh, Charlotte, you forgot these. These sketches of Lewis... Were done today. Pretty good likeness, don't you think? -Is everything alright? -Sure. Everything's perfectly clear. [Cleo] She's been doing all this on purpose. Giving me heaps of homework, keeping me out of action while she moves in on Lewis. -Hang on, what's she doing, exactly? -She's been sketching him. I'm serious. Cleo, don't you think you might be overreacting just a little? Hello! I even caught her wearing my locket. She wanted to know why we all wear them. -Why would she wanna know that? -I don't know. Maybe we better find Lewis. [Lewis] I don't see what all the fuss is about. Just because she likes a piece of jewellery. It's not about the jewellery. She manipulated the whole situation. She volunteered to tutor me so she could keep me busy while she worked on you. Worked on me? What are you talking about? We think she's trying to get close to us. There's another possibility. Maybe Charlotte just likes me. [sighs] Lewis, she's taking advantage of you. Why do you care anyway? I don't. I mean, we're just trying to look after our secret. If that's all you're worried about, forget it, your secret's safe with me. If you don't mind, I'm going out with Charlotte. Really? Where? Mako Island. And before you all totally freak out, she just wants to go there to sketch the beach, nothing more. Lewis, have you completely lost your mind? See? First the locket, now Mako Island. -She's getting too close. -Cleo's right. -You can't take Charlotte to Mako. -I agree. Mako is off-limits. Says who? You're not in charge of me. If I want to take Charlotte to Mako, I will. In fact, that's what I'm going to do right now. So stop bossing me around. That seemed to go pretty well. This is going to be so great. Hmm? I said, this is gonna be great. -You okay? -Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. [engine starts] Ooh! Wow! Look at this. It's almost exactly the same. [Lewis] That's what I thought. You're just gonna sketch this and then be off? No way. I wanna see more. There's a whole folio of paintings to compare. I wanna kill Lewis for this. He's got some serious payback coming. He's got it under control. They're staying by the beach. As long as he doesn't head inland. -Charlotte, where are we going? -I really wanna find where this is. -I think it might be further inland. -No, I don't think that's a good idea. -Why don't we go back the other way? -Why? What are you scared of? [Lewis] It could be dangerous. There could be caves and trees and bugs. I'm not scared of bugs. Are you coming? [exhales] It's beautiful. [shushes] [Emma grunts] -Did you hear that? -Hear what? I've got the feeling someone's watching us. [Lewis] Nobody comes out here. Maybe we should head back. No, not yet. I can't see them. Cleo! Cleo! What are you doing? I'm cold. But it's about 28 degrees. Well, not in the shade, it's not. Then we should head back down to the beach where it's sunny. Don't you wanna sit with me? Charlotte, now would be a good time to remember that we're just... I definitely heard something. There! Charlotte! Charlotte, there's something I need to tell you. Hello? Anybody home? [Don] Cleo. Mr. Hamm just rang through the result from your supplementary exam. You got an A. Well done, sweetheart! [sighs] That's good, I suppose. Dad, can I have Charlotte tutor me next time? -[Don] You must be over the moon, Cleo. -Yeah, it's great. I've been thinking. Why don't we invite Charlotte for a barbecue so you can thank her properly? What did I say? [door slams] ["I Let Go" playing] Cleo. I wanted to see you. I figured maybe we needed to talk. Talk? Talk about what? Well, you know, about stuff. About Mako Island, actually. When I was out there with Charlotte, it looked different from how it was. You don't have to explain. -I understand. -You do? Yeah. There's nothing going on between us. You can do what you want. ♪ When you say my name... ♪ Right. Okay. That's good to know. ♪ There's no safety left below ♪ Cleo. I heard you did really well in your supplementary exam. Yeah, great, actually. My best mark ever. Aren't you going to thank me? Thanks. For everything. So, we still going out tonight? Yeah, I guess so. [Charlotte] Great, because I was thinking movies; come on, let's go. He's not happy. Anyone can see that. Even if he is, it's not gonna last. It doesn't matter. It's his life.
