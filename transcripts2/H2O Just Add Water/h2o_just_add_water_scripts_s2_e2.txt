I am so sorry. -Are you alright? -Sure, I think. You don't have to be sorry. It's not your fault. I know. I'm just really sorry it happened. That water just jumped out from nowhere. Yeah, there are some really strong winds around here.

 The trees create some sort of wind tunnel. You must be new. I'm Charlotte. Cleo. So, what do you think of our school? I like it. I'd like it even more if I could find the art room. It's just, uh, near the library. I can show you if you'd like. -Thanks. -Lewis, this is... -Charlotte. -Charlotte. Hi. Hi. What happened to you? A sprinkler just jumped out in front of me. [chuckles] Really? Mm, we should get going, but nice to meet you. Yeah, you, too. -Ah, the art room... -Don't worry, I'll find it. -I'll see you around sometime. -Yeah. You got it. [Lewis] Come on. So, has anyone else had their powers go a bit too far? Like what? Have you done anything really extreme lately? -No. -I don't see what all the drama is about. -So what if we've got some new powers? -Your powers have increased off the scale. That last full moon had some rare planetary alignments. -Again with the planetary alignments. -[Lewis] It has to mean something. And until I figure out what, you need to learn some control. -You don't know what you're capable of. -That's what's cool. Lewis has a point. We need to be careful. That's why I need to measure the range of your powers. Here we go again. I'll help you through, Cleo. Don't worry. -I'm not worried. -Every step of the way, I'll be there. Great. I'm gonna get a juice. I'll get it. -It's okay, I'll get it. -No, I insist. Actually, I don't want a juice anymore. I changed my mind. -No. You sure? -Yeah. -I've got to go. -Where are you going? -You going to Mako? -Maybe. I just need to be by myself for a while. Alright. I'll see you later. Want my advice? Loosen the leash a little. [Rikki] There you are. Hey. Is everything okay? Yeah, I've just got a lot on my mind at the moment and I needed some time to think. -What about? -[Lewis] Hi, guys. Time for some testing. Is this gonna take much longer? Because I do have a life. [grunts] Okay, try and keep your hand movements to a minimum. Remember, small. Think small, and then divide it by ten. -I have no idea what you're talking about. -Just try. But it's so lame. -Lewis, are you sure about this? -Yes. Yes, I am. It's important. Remember, small movements. [sighs] Good. That's good. -Whoa, whoa! -[stammering] Um... Stop, stop, stop! Stop it! [chuckles] -That's not good. -Are you kidding? That was cool. -I could really have some fun with this. -[Lewis] Who's next? Alright. [exhales] [crackling] [grunts] Okay, Cleo, third time lucky. -I'm not doing that. -You could have fun. -[Cleo] This is not how I have fun. -[Rikki] What do you have to lose? What if I can't control what happens? There is nothing to worry about. I'm gonna be right next to you the entire time. That's comforting... -I guess. -Please, Cleo, just try it for me. I know it's scary, but I'm not gonna leave you. Not for a second. [Lewis] Take a deep breath, focus only on your powers, and control-- Okay. I'll try it. Just stop talking for a minute. Alright, not another word. Except-- I want you to know that I'm proud of you. I'm really-- I'm really proud of you. That's all. -Do you want me to hold your other hand? -No! [wind howling] -[whistle blows] -[Billy] You're gonna miss for sure. You run like a girl. Miss! Miss! Bet you're gonna miss. Loser. That was the worst shot I've ever seen. Elliot, what's your problem? -Your brother was hassling me. -Oh, don't make excuses. My nana could kick straighter. Get to the back of the line. -Don't miss it again. -[blows whistle] Here we go, Lachlan. I'm sorry, Lewis. I didn't mean to do that. [scoffs] Stop apologising. It only hurts when I move. That was pretty cool, though. -Having that much power on tap is a rush. -Maybe. But that kind of power demands responsibility. Until we learn control, we can't be tempted to use our powers. None of us. Why did you just look at me when you said that? -I didn't. -Yes, you did. You don't think I can control myself? Well, you are the one who thinks it's a bit of a rush. Here we go! [players] Thanks, Coach! Now, Billy trained the hardest today, so he's gonna be captain again this week. -Well done, Billy! -Yes! I am the coolest! No, I'm the coolest, but you're a close second. Now the rest of you, we have a big game tomorrow. Okay? We are gonna win this, guys. We're gonna rule! [kids] Yeah! -[Nate] Here we go! -So how's things? Great. How come you aren't with the guys? I don't want to sit there, alright? -Want to go home and kick the ball? -Be a waste of time. You can show me that scissor kick you've been practising. I'm no good at it. Don't be silly. Of course you are. -Who told you that? -Everyone. Just leave me alone. [crowd cheering] Hey! How are you feeling today? Lewis. You're here. -So early. -Yeah. Well, I got here before you started work. You really don't have to do that. -Single scoop vanilla, thanks. -Sure. Here, let me. You relax and take it easy. I don't want to take it easy, Lewis. There we go. Thank you. Sorry I put you under so much pressure yesterday. I've cleared my whole day so we can hang out together. Lewis is driving me crazy. -You mean it's taken you this long? -He's really getting on my nerves. He wants to fix everything. I guess he means well. I just wish he'd let us deal with it. He won't leave me alone. I feel like I'm under a microscope. -I really like him, but he's... -Totally suffocating. Yes. He's doing everything right. But I can't stand it anymore. I don't know what to do. Here's a thought. Dump him. Rikki. Let me talk to him. If he knew how you were feeling, he'd give you space. No. I can handle this. It's just something I need to work through. -[keying] -[computer beeping] No. No, no, no! I don't believe this! -That's cool. That's really cool. -You okay? Yeah, uh, just... My battery died. Well, I've got my computer here. Looks like the same model. You can use my battery. Really? Well, that'll be great. So, what are you working on that's so important? Well, I'm actually researching miraculous natural phenomena. Oh, I love all that. So, where are they? -Who? -Those girls. Cleo and the others. -You seem to hang with them a lot. -Yeah. That's because we're good friends. Sure. Well, I better go. Hey, do you want your battery back? You keep it. I've got yours. -[whistle blows] -[crowd clapping] Come on, Lachlan, get behind him, mate! He can't take them all by himself. Good one, Elliot! Yes, yes, yes! Move it, Elliot. Too slow! Elliot was doing great until Billy crossed in front of him. You just can't see it because he's your brother. Great shot, Billy. Stay focused now, mate! Careful. You don't want to lose control. I am perfectly in control. Come on! Foul! What? Wow, you're really good. -I had no idea. -Thanks. -What sort of painting is that? -Japanese brush painting. Hmm. How do you get so many colours with the one brush? With the smallest movements. You have to be precise and exact. Here. Yeah, see? Precise and exact. It's like the Japanese proverb. If you want to fly like a butterfly, don't flap like a crow. -Charlotte, you are the best! -I am? Why? I've gotta go. I'll talk to you later. -And why am I doing this? -Trust me. It just takes practice. If you want to fly like a butterfly, don't flap like a crow. What? This can teach you to be precise, you know, with your powers. Okay. Here, copy this. Fine. Remember, precise and exact. See? You're in control. Now, put down the brush and do the same with your powers. -Are you sure? -Sure, I'm sure. [Lewis] Gently. Easy. Easy. [wind howling] [glass shatters] [thuds] [crowd clapping] Good one, Elliot! Oh! Come on, Elliot! That was pathetic! -The idea is to kick the ball! -Billy shoved him. Yeah, only because Elliot was in his way. Good thinking, Billy. Stop dragging your feet, Elliot! I can't believe this. Every time Elliot gets the ball, he's fouled by his teammates. -It's so unfair. -There, there. Don't lose your cool. Remember, control. Relax. I'm in control. Too slow. [groans] Stay on your feet, Elliot! -[Nate] Hopeless! -Can't you see what he's doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa! [screaming] Help! [screaming] -Yeah! -[crowd applauding] Yeah! [laughs] Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Now, that is control. [Nate] You're the man! He's the man! Get up, Billy. Yeah! Oh, yeah! -Oh, yeah! -Yeah! -I don't know what happened! -I don't care, Billy. You almost lost us the game. That was a sweet goal. Perfect. Arced through the air and straight past the goalie. -So awesome. -You were lucky, Elliot. That wasn't lucky. That was skill. And I could play in the World Cup if I wanted to. So how about it, Elliot? Want to be captain? I'll think about it. Great. Sounds like you've created a monster. There. Remember, small, decisive strokes. -I can't do it. -Yes, you can. I'm here to help you. That's it. I give up. Lewis, leave the brush. -This is too weird. -What is? Doing everything for me, being with me every minute of the day. -I'm just trying to help. -Well, it's making me feel worse. I'm really confused right now. First, Mum and Dad split up, and then I turn into some power freak. Hey. You still have me. I know. And if things were halfway normal, that would be great. But you can't help me right now, Lewis. Yes, I can. I can fix it. Why are you always having to fix everyone? You can't fix us this time. This is up to Emma and Rikki and me. You're not one of us, Lewis. -I almost am. -No, you're not. I don't know how to say this, Lewis... but I think it would be better if I were alone for a while. That's a good idea. I mean really alone. As in by myself. Without a boyfriend. Cleo, you just missed the funniest thing ever. It wasn't that bad. Nate's little brother was about to take the kick of his life when suddenly Captain Control here-- I broke up with Lewis. I told him I needed to be alone. But I don't feel any better. You seriously broke up with him? For real? -See what you've done? -I was joking. I didn't think you'd actually do it. It's alright. It was my decision.

The smallest strokes create the best effects. If you want to fly like a butterfly, don't flap like a crow. Who wants to fly like a butterfly? Now, let's try with our powers. It worked!
