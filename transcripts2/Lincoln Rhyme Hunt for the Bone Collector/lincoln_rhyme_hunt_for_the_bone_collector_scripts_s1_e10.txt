 Previously on "Lincoln Rhyme"... Agent Cutter. So you're the dog with the bone flooding my inbox every day with your thoughts? You're smart, and you're good, but if you can't play on the team, you'll only be so good. I read your file. Sounds like you're just putting in the required three years so you can get in the FBI. Then what, be a profiler?

 The FBI rejected me. This is... Jane. You're the Bone Collector. I am. You know that if you kill me, it'll torture you. I've been looking through the files from Westchester. Oh, my God. You found something. A victim who got away who might still be alive. You think it's the Bone Collector? I need that name. Peter. - Peter Taylor. - I know him.

Peter Taylor, show yourself. ♪ What to do ♪ The record hops ♪ ♪ And all the happy times we had ♪ [TENSE MUSIC] ♪  NYPD. Show me your hands. Careful. You know how he is with traps. ♪  Oh, my God. That's his wife. Danielle Taylor, maiden name Crocker. Bastard killed his own wife. - We need a crime tech in here. - No, we don't have time. This doesn't look like his other kills. There's no sign of trauma. No blood. Her hand. [GASPS] Her ring finger... he took out the bone. He wanted us to know this marriage meant something to him. Check the other hand. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Red fabric. Leather maybe, and some sort of residue on her palm. [PHONE RINGING] It's coming from her body. Have Sellitto answer it. I want to watch. [RINGING CONTINUES] We know who you are, Peter Taylor. Detective Sellitto, it is you, isn't it, the man who put his partner in danger? You let him go into that warehouse three years ago - without backups? - You son of a... I want to talk to Lincoln Rhyme. Patch him through. Peter Taylor. Lincoln Rhyme. We finally get to play out in the open. Your face is going to be plastered all over the city. You won't be able to get a cup of coffee without someone calling 911. You don't know what I'm capable of. I was under your nose for years, right next to you, but the great Lincoln Rhyme was too focused on himself, his book, his fame, to pay attention to a lab tech like myself. Trying to get his location. Signal is scrambled. - Keep him talking. - Is that what this is about? Jealousy? Gods suppressed become devils. So you consider yourself a deity? I consider myself superior to you. Really? Looks like you just killed the one person who trusted you. I spared her the madness of what's to come. You murdered her. You're missing the point. You delude yourself that there is a point. There is only your psychopathy, your insanity. Now you're profiling, Lincoln, which tells me I'm winning. You're grasping at the academic because you have nothing concrete to find me. You overestimate yourself. Now you're showing your arrogance, your... your fatal flaw. There's a new game, Lincoln. You still have your clues, but I'm not stopping at three bodies. I'm going to keep killing so the world knows your insignificance. We're going to stop you. There, that's my point. You can't stop me. - Peter Taylor. - A forensic tech. I barely knew he was there. Well, he remembers you. I need everything you have. I want the Bone Collector. Not to put too fine a point on it, but are you squeezing us out? As Lincoln can tell you, I believe in the team approach, something I'm happy you've embraced. A lot has changed since we last saw each other. I see that. You look good, Lincoln. - So do you. - Mm, even the gray hair? Gives you character. To answer Detective Sellitto's question, we are not taking the case. We are working in step on this for now. Talk to me. Felix. Peter Taylor. Date of birth February 10th, 1968, Worked as a lab tech with the NYPD from 2005 to 2017, married Danielle Crocker 2011. Now his wife's in the morgue downtown. We have an arsenal of clues on this one; we can stop him. But looking at this report, I may have something. Amelia Sachs, my eyes and ears and sometimes my second brain. Agent Cutter, I'm actually a huge fan of your work. I audited your forensic psychology course. It changed the way I thought about crime. And did anything you learn give you insight into our suspect? It did. He married in 2011, started the Bone Collector kills in 2012. This relationship anchored him. 5 years, 15 murders, no mistakes, then suddenly he stops. Why? The object of his competition, Lincoln Rhyme, is no longer in the game. Then Lincoln comes back, jolts the Bone Collector. He moves back to New York City, starts making mistakes. He even... kills his wife. - Meaning what? - Meaning that, while it's obvious the Bone Collector is fixated on you, without his anchor, he starts slipping. Unless he finds a new anchor. That's impressive, Detective Sachs. - Officer. - Then we find the next anchor. We have a location on the parents, in-laws? His parents are both deceased. Danielle Crocker's parents live in Queens. Uni is on the way to notify them now. ALL: We're not putting unis on this. Sellitto, Danielle's parents, not just a notification. We need to find out everything they know about this guy and if they've seen him. I'll send agents with you. We share information. What I know, you know. What you know, I know. If you ever think about a career in profiling, give me a call. [BLOWS] Clue number one: goatskin leather, red dye. Nothing special except traces of polytetrafluoroethylene, commonly known as Teflon, on the underside. - Teflon. - Bulletproof vest, maybe? It doesn't seem dense enough for a vest. More likely waterproofing or possibly a Teflon tape of some kind. What about the residue on the wife's hand? Clue two: epinephrine. Adrenalin. Did the victim have food allergies? Working on medical records. We didn't find any evidence of it at the scene. There was no EpiPens, no medications. But it was highly diluted. I don't think we're dealing with injectable adrenaline. Teflon-coated leather... adrenalin... two clues, not enough. What's the third? Song? That would be my bet. He left it on repeat, which means he wanted us to hear it. Felix, pull it up. ♪ What to do now that she doesn't want me ♪ "What to Do" by Buddy Holly. Lyrics mean anything? Maybe it's not the lyrics. It was one of Holly's final recordings he taped at his apartment in Greenwich Village. Goatskin leather, adrenaline, Greenwich Village. [TRAFFIC SOUNDS] Hard Times Boxing Gym. Excuse me? Red leather. From a boxing glove. They often contain Teflon. Adrenaline, used to treat cuts during a fight. The song, recorded in Greenwich Village, the location of Hard Times Gym, my gym from back in the day. These clues are about me. He's connecting them to my past again. Amelia, I want you and Eric there now. I'll have Cutter meet you. Go. Hey. What did Sellitto get on Danielle's parents? Nothing that helps us. Never had a clue that Taylor was anything other than a good guy, good husband, go figure. No one at NYPD had any idea either. - He compartmentalized. - Yeah. Damn freak, he could just be out here walking around like normal. Look familiar? 30 years, the place hasn't changed. - Office clear. - Spend a lot of time here? Kept me off the street, out of trouble. You, trouble? Oh, I have a past. Locker room clear. Love to hear about it sometime. [GASPS] Lincoln... Cutter. [DARK MUSIC] ♪  [GASPING] I never saw him. [SHIVERING] I... I didn't see him. Someone brushed against me, and I woke up here, like this. - It's okay. - No, no, no. - We're gonna get you out. - No, no, no! Wait. He set up a motion sensor. The pipes are rigged to burst if you come too close. Or I stand up. The steam will cook you alive. We have to do something! It's a stomach wound. She's bleeding out. We can't. She's in bad shape, okay? I can't let you put yourself in harm's way. Okay. We just need to figure out what he wants us to do and do the opposite. It's too late. It's too late. This is a no-win situation. Amelia, I know what you're thinking, but even if you figure it out, we can't save her. We just need to find where the sensors are and disable them. Amelia, no, it's too dangerous! Lincoln Rhyme would find another way. Lincoln Rhyme ended up paralyzed looking for another way. Well, he's not invincible, Lincoln, okay? Peter Taylor is not invincible. We can do this. Amelia, I've been doing this a long time. You have to know what part's bravery and what part's futility. I am not giving up. She is not gonna die. No, we can't, Amelia. We can't. We can't! That will kill you. I'll be damned if I'm going to let him do to you what he did to Linc... [SCREAMING] Amelia! [SCREAMING] [SHRIEKING] [SOMBER MUSIC] ♪  Amelia. Watching someone die... Someone I knew... someone I looked up to. Hey. I know. I know we don't have time for emotion right now. I have to put it aside until this is done. I'm not putting my emotions aside. - No? - Hell no. I'm angry. I'm furious. So if you want to be sad, be sad. Let it fuel you. If you want to be mad, let it motivate you. [SCOFFS] Yeah, I like that. The Bone Collector won't know what's coming. One more thing. I'm no longer calling him that, the self-anointed, self-important title. You know who he really is? Peter Taylor, the small man behind the big name. We're going to make sure he pays for what he just did to Cutter. For what he did to all of them. Mm. [DRAMATIC MUSIC CRESCENDOS] ♪  Three clues left at the boxing gym. Here's number one. It's an electronic key card of some kind. It's not your standard hotel one as far as I can tell, which might work in our favor 'cause it could make it easier to narrow down. Which you're doing right now? I just wanted to keep you in the loop. Which I'm doing right now. I'll do a deeper dive. Clues two and three are a pair. I'm so sorry. I should've cropped that. No, I need to see everything. Keep going. A flower petal. I am running the DNA through a horticultural database. - Flower DNA? - All living things. What's near the petal? Water and wheat flour, maybe from a flatbread or a cracker. So he's literally leaving us bread crumbs. And all I can tell you right now is that there's some sort of imprint on it, maybe a letter I. I'm working the image. I'll try to enhance it once I run down the key card. Lincoln. Claire, what's the matter? - It's Naia and Camden. - What's wrong? They're here. Surprise! Hi. You changed everything in here. It's like a high-tech Batcave. I thought you'd be past your Batman phase by now. I'm in my Steph Curry phase. I can do the two-handed dribble. His team had a tournament. Steph Curry here wanted to surprise you. Well, I'm surprised. Camden, do you want to give your mom and I a minute? Claire keeps the fridge stocked, plenty of good stuff. What's going on? We ID'd the Bone Collector last night. You didn't see anything? Oh, God. We got to the airport at 8:00. I've been in airplane mode. I... who is he? He was a forensic specialist. We were in the academy together. - You knew him? - He was... innocuous, forgettable, - but still, I should have... - What? Found him, caught him, put him away. He just killed an FBI agent. He killed his wife. This time, he's not stopping until I catch him. Or until he catches you. What you're really looking for is in the drawer. Sellitto's not gonna like that. Hm, yeah, well, don't tell anyone I told you. His kettle corn, you have it? Oh, yeah. Legendary, right? Hey, let's you and I get out of here. There's not enough to share. Get Naia and Camden to a safe house. Set up the best team you know. No one gets in. No one gets out. I'll do you one better. I'll stay there myself. Sellitto's new partner? Detective Eric Castillo, ma'am. Bone Collector isn't gonna get anywhere near your family. Whenever you're ready. [SOMBER MUSIC] ♪  [INHALES] Camden, here's the deal. I'm going to be honest with you. The Bone Collector is back in New York. He's coming after me, and I'm going after him. You scared? Me too. But my money's on you. I love you. I'll see you when this is over. We've had time; we need to figure out the three clues. Key card? Here's what I found. The magnetic strip tell us the card is manufactured by NPC, Inc., National Plastic Cards. The type is the NPC 42. Three dozen hotels in the area that use it. Kate, please tell us we're closer on the breadcrumbs. We are. The imprint wasn't the letter I. It was this. - A communion wafer. - And according to the imprint, this specific one was made at a cloistered monastery in Philadelphia. Well, he's not sending us to Philadelphia. What's the flower? A peony, a white peony. You know what it means. It's not the monastery. It's the church where you take communion at a Catholic wedding but have the reception at a hotel. If you check that list, you're going to find the Marcy Hotel across the river in Jersey uses the NPC 42 key card. The peony is a flower often used in boutonnieres, which I know because I wore one at Sellitto's last wedding, where I was best man. I had him check the house where Peter Taylor grew up. He should have been back by now. No answer. - I got to move. - Take the key card. Whatever it's for at the Marcy Hotel, that's where you'll find him. [WHISPERS] Okay. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] ♪  NYPD... I need you to tell me which room this card opens. Now! Come on, come on. It's not for any of the guest rooms. It's for roof access for maintenance. Thank you. Let's move! - I'm on the roof. - All right. Find him. Sellitto! Sellitto! I don't see him. He has to be up there. Amelia, watch every step. I see him! Oh, God, no. - Carefully. - Move fast. - Sellitto! - Amelia, wait! Dammit. Careful. What do you expect? You trained her. He's breathing. I need some help over here. - [BLADE SLICES] - Got you. Okay. Got him. Okay, breathe. Okay. I think he wanted me to swallow that. You okay? Um, all things considered, no, but... there are more important things at the moment: clues. Things, you know... We need to get you checked out. I'm okay. Just give me a minute. [DARK MUSIC] ♪  - Are you seeing this? - What is that, a... a mirror? Whatever it is, bring it back here with the casing. We still need to find the third clue. There may not be one. Sellitto is still alive; there was nothing rigged to take you down when you found him. Do you think we interrupted him? Maybe he had a camera in the lobby and saw you coming in or heard you, but knowing him, no way he'd leave Sellitto alive. Hey, are you okay? What are you doing here alone, Sellitto? I let him down. Sellitto, you were drugged and kidnapped. It's not your fault. Sure it is. I let it happen. What are you talking about? Ever since the Bone Collector's been back, it's been about Lincoln: his book, his professor. You heard the call this morning. - I know. - So we all know that puts a target on our backs. You, you send Rachel out of town. Camden and Naia are in lockdown, and me, I didn't see him coming. You said he was hiding in the back of your car. Yeah, I had just checked out his old house. I got back in the car. I went to turn on the ignition. I felt a sting in the back of my neck, and that's all I remember until I woke up on the roof with your flashlight in my face. Again, not your fault. Come on. Come on. I put us all in danger because I let that son of a bitch get the better of me, and that will not happen again. He didn't talk to you? Taunt you? After the car, everything went black. Claire, you don't have to take care of me. I'm fine. Lincoln's worried. I help you, I'm helping him, and in case you're wondering, Camden took your kettle corn. - [CHUCKLES] - Thank you. Look, I wish I had more. I wish Kate found trace. I wish I knew the third clue, but I have nothing else to offer. We have to work from what we have: the casing and the metal plate. - It's a daguerreotype. - A what? A primitive photograph, a process invented in 1839, a photo developed on a silver-plated copper surface sensitized with iodine and exposure to a mercury vapor. - So what's the picture? - Felix is working on that. - I always wanted to do this. - Glad someone's having fun. We're exposing the plate to mercury fumes, and I have to fix the image in a sodium thiosulfate solution. Otherwise, it will disappear. Thanks for the primer. Trying to work the casing here. - Anything? - Nine millimeter Parabellum. Striations say it was fired from a Glock 17, residue says sometime within the last 12 hours. Anything on Sellitto's clues? No trace I can pinpoint to the Bone Collector, and we still don't have a third clue. I'm not sure how it works if we only have two. Maybe a little heat. And as Monsieur Daguerre himself might say, "Voilà". I'm running an image search, see if we can identify them. Stephen A. Halsey, noted fur trader from the mid-1800s. Go on. Halsey also famously sold his land to John Jacob Astor, the wealthiest man in America at the time. It became what is now known as Astoria, New York. Astoria. Okay. So we have the location. And with the shell, we have a possible murder weapon. The problem is we don't have a third clue. [CUP AND SAUCER RATTLING] Still a little shaken up is all. Amelia, get Sellitto to the nearest emergency room. I'm telling you, you're overreacting, Lincoln. And I'm telling you, it's like what you said. You don't exactly know what happened from the time you were taken to the time you woke up. He injected you with something. It's also possible there was something else in the shell casing besides just a bullet. If we all know Peter Taylor, I don't think we interrupted him before his third clue. It's you. You're the third clue. Look, I'm fine, Amelia. Just take me home. - [MUMBLING] - Sellitto, shut up. Sit down. NYPD emergency, I need a doctor, and I need them now. - What's the problem? - No, it's not for me. It's for him. [SHIVERING] Sellitto? Oh, my God. We need a doctor, now! Doc! Sir, sir! Can you hear me? - What do we got? - Unresponsive. [OVERLAPPING CHATTER] [SOFT DRAMATIC MUSIC] ♪  What's his status? Don't look so surprised. He's my partner eight years. You think I'm not coming down here to tell him to wake the hell up? He, uh... he's stable for now. Lincoln, they still don't know what it is. ♪  I hate hospitals. When I was... injured, I was in a bed like this for an eternity. They told me I had visitors, but I turned them away. Sellitto kept coming back no matter how many times I told him no. I think he thought I didn't want him there because I blamed him. But that wasn't it. I was angry I couldn't be what I used to be. Three years, I felt that way. He kept coming, kept trying... and finally, he brought me you. Well, he needed you. And you needed him. Coming here, I realize why he kept coming. It's not guilt, but pity. It's friendship. I'm here to give him mine. I think you should tell him that. I just did. How is Eric taking it? [CHUCKLES] He knows we've got this. Said he has a job to do. He's not going to leave my family. - Atropa belladonna. - That's the poison? And they can treat it. They're on their way. I lit a fire. Okay, so it's a plant with highly toxic berries. And quite a tradition of use in murders and assassinations. He... he's gonna be okay. They're treating him with physostigmine now, which has its own complications, but... But he's strong, he's pig-headed, and he will not let the... Peter win. Okay, so we have the third clue: belladonna, somewhere in Astoria, and a shell casing from a Glock 17. I don't know. Okay, think. This is about you, so just let your mind drift. It'll come to you. I know that. I just... Belladonna, I'm drawing a blank. A- I've got your journal here, so let's... let's work it through. Has a long history of use as a poison. Ancient Roman warriors would apply it to the tips of their arrows. Macbeth used belladonna to poison the troops of Harold Harefoot, King of England, forcing them to retreat to their ships. It's used in medicines, in cosmetics, in eye drops. Women used to use it to dilate the pupils of their eyes so they could appear more seductive. Belladonna, it's also referred to as deadly nightshade. It's a perennial herbaceous plant. Wait, what's it called? Nightshade, deadly nightshade. Why? - You know what it is. - I know what it is. I know where it is, and I know who. - Amelia? - The Night Shade Cafe in Astoria... it's the new name of the diner where my parents were killed with a 9-millimeter round fired by a Glock 17. That makes no sense. It's indicating you. You're right here. I know, and I just called Rachel. She's safe, but I'm going. The hell you are. He's targeting you. Taunting us, yes, but what I know is that there's someone out there, someone out there that I can save if I get there in time, just like we saved Sellitto, just like we saved that woman at Grand Central. You're not going. Sellitto is out of commission, and Eric isn't leaving your family. Lincoln, I need your eyes and ears in that cafe to end this once for all. The ESU... The ESU could destroy evidence if they go in there alone. That's what you always tell me. The answer is no. I am not asking you, Lincoln. Whoever he has there tied up or poisoned or clinging to life, I can stop it, and I can stop another person from dying in that damn diner. [HELICOPTERS WHIRRING] [SIRENS WAILING] You need to talk her through this, Lincoln. I couldn't talk her out of it. You think I can talk her through it? Yes, I do. She's waiting for it. Amelia, all that this place means to you, everything it represents, you need to put it away now. - I'm fine. - No, you're not fine, but you can do this. All right. Okay. It's just another... restaurant. [TENSE MUSIC] ♪  The restaurant where the Bone Collector may have laid a trap, so you are to hang back and let ESU do their job. Yes, sir. If we see something to help, fine. No chances, no risks. - Kitchen's clear. - Bathroom's clear. Amelia. Amelia. All right, show me the room. Okay. What do you see? Just let me see it. Okay. Amelia, stay with me on this. But if this is about you, tell me what's the same, what's different. The layout. This is it. The decor, everything, it's... it's Lasky's. Okay. - Now, where did it happen? - Lincoln. He's brought you here for a reason. Where did it happen? It was right here. Julie, she was coming to our table. She was smiling at me. Then she brought us the check. Whitehead came in, and when he called her name, she turned... And he shot her. My father stood up and tried to stop it, and he shot him. And my mother leaned in to shield me... [DRAMATIC MUSIC CRESCENDOS] ♪  [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] And she got shot. It was here. [SOLEMN MUSIC] ♪  He shot them right here. There's something on that smoke alarm right there. Tell her not to move! Wait, don't move! I felt something when I stood on the booth. - Can you see what it is? - Tell her to get out of there. - Amelia. - It's the job, Lincoln. You would do it if you were here. Now work with me. Don't move. What is it? It's a trigger, a wire going down. Here, help me get this up. Device! Set a perimeter! Don't let anyone else out! [DEVICE TICKING] - What is it? - What it is is the same device from the warehouse the day I fell. Well, what is it? Why didn't the dogs smell it? The dogs have to be trained for each substance. A-234 is a Russian nerve agent, Novichok. Lincoln, you know what this is. You did it before, and you know how to disarm it. Tell me what you did. - I pulled the white wire. - That just means... That means we don't know. He knows I know that stopped him then, so is it the red wire this time, the green one, or would he think I think it's the other wires, so it's white again? Or is it neither? Well, you stop it, and the floor falls out from under you. We have to make a choice. She can't stand here forever. - Lincoln. - Not now, Claire! This is exactly your problem, Lincoln. [OMINOUS MUSIC] ♪  You're always looking for me, but you never really see me. - Lincoln, do you copy? - What do you say, Lincoln? Let's see how she does on her own. - Lincoln! - Can she do it without the great Lincoln Rhyme in her ear? - It's over, Peter. You won. - I know. It's me you want. Kill me, not Amelia. But I didn't come here to kill you. - I came here to watch you... - Lincoln, I need your help! - Watch her die. - Lincoln, do you copy? Not just a fiery death, no. You know what happens with nerve gas? - Seizures... - Lincoln, do you copy? Respiratory paralysis, bradycardia, coma, and yes, eventually death. But I want to watch you watch every awful moment. Lincoln, what do I do? Can you hear me? Come on, Lincoln. I need you. Why are you doing this? He forced me to take what I love the most! I'm returning a favor! Lincoln, what wire do I choose? [BREATHING HARD] Everything means something. Everything means something. Whatever I choose is going to set the Bone Collector's trap in motion. It doesn't matter what I pick. It's not designed for me to win. Clear! Clear the cafe now! It's going to blow! Move! Everybody, clear the cafe! It's going to blow! If I move, I'll trigger the bomb. You set the bomb in motion, but I don't think this has anything to do with you. This is about me and the bomb. You have to go. I need you to get down so you can help clear the area. Time is running out. Move now! Look at her, about to die in same spot her parents died. I can do this. - How tragically poetic. - Well, she was right. The wire didn't matter. Did it? Of course not. - I have the trigger right here. - Lincoln? Lincoln, come on. I need to know you're there. You know why I didn't know you were the Bone Collector? You... you are so insignificant. It only proves my point: your need to make others believe you're more than you are. Huh. And I should... what, cry? Crack? Change my mind? Lincoln, I can't do this without you. Let's take her out of her misery. Please don't do it. Please don't... You are evil. Yeah. You are about to find out how right you are. She's next, Lincoln, in her trip down Kill Everyone You Care About Lane. - [GROANS] - So what shall it be: slit her throat or take her out the front door? - Which scares you more, Claire? - Mm... Uggh... - Oh, please. - [GROANS] What is this? - Autonomic dysreflexia. - [GRUNTS] - Well, can you make it stop? - I don't know. It can kill him if I don't try. You have to save him! This is not how he's going to die! He needs nitroglycerin medication. It's over there on the tray. Well, get it! Officer Sachs! Lib, go get an EMT. You're okay. Come on. You're okay. Shh. [WHIMPERING] Is everyone okay? Thanks to you, everyone got out. HAZMAT is sealing it off. What were you doing in there? I think the Bone Collector was watching me through my camera, so I took it off. I made it look like I was still in there. So watching you how? There's only one explanation. The Bone Collector got to Lincoln. Get a team to Lincoln's apartment! Drew, Lib, let's go right now! - Quick! - [GRUNTING] Mm... mm... You're not going to die. [GROANING] Stay with me. Stay with Claire. Stay with me, Lincoln. Stay with me! - [GROANING] - Stay with me! Stay with me. Stay with me, stay with me. Stay with me. There, there. This will help. Look, he's settling. That's enough. [SIRENS APPROACHING] - Aah! - NYPD is pulling up. You'll never get past them. Bitch! Oh... ugh! This isn't over. [FOREBODING MUSIC] [SIRENS APPROACHING] Fire escape. - He's gone. - They're close. Maybe they'll catch him. Are you okay? All thanks to you. I thought that was real, your attack. Well, if you didn't believe it, he wouldn't either. - Call Amelia. - Mm. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Oh, my God. [RINGING] - Lincoln? - You're alive. You're alive. I thought the Bone Collector got there. I sent FBI. He was. He was. He's gone. He heard them coming. He got away. He could be anywhere. - We'll get him, Lincoln. - I know. We have to. We're fine in here, Lincoln. We're holed up tight. - And you're okay, Lincoln? - Now that I see you're safe. We are. Camden is fast asleep. Wore him out playing Fortnite. Ha. That's good. But I need you to do something for me, Eric. I want the three of you out of there. Coordinate with the department. I want you far away, out of the city. Copy that, and I'm glad you're okay, Lincoln, and that Sellitto is, too. I hear he's awake and alert. I knew he'd pull through. He's too stubborn to die. Lincoln. Come with us. You want us to be safe. I want to know you're safe. You know I can't do that. Well, you can, but I know you won't. Naia, this is my fight. I've got to finish it. Look. I got to go. I'll see you all soon. Lincoln, be careful, please. Detective Rhyme, Agent Beresford. You're taking over for Cutter. Picking up where she left off. Just came from the Nightshade. No casualties, thanks to Amelia. She was a hero. I know, but Peter Taylor is still out there. NYPD is on full alert. I got agents all throughout the city checking bridges, tunnels, trains. - He's not leaving the city. - Because he's hurt? No, because he's not done. Rest assured, he's not getting near you again. If you want to get him, I need to work this crime scene.. [DOOR CLOSES] And my team is here. Thank you. Are you ready? Well, I just talked to Rachel. She's 200 miles away in Rhode Island. My head is in the game. I'm ready. Good. Then let's get 'im. So what's his next move? I want to know what your gut tells you now. Well, he went after Cutter, Sellitto, me and Claire, so my gut tells me that he wants you to watch everyone you care about die. Which is why I have them protected. So what does he do then? A great detective once told me to follow the evidence. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] ♪  I think we just caught a break. He yanked the scissors out while he was running. Claire got him through his jacket, into his shoulder. Maybe he left a trace when he yanked it out. You sure this is a good idea? Bone Collector got to Lincoln. No way I'm wasting another second in this place. But the doctor said that you... I don't care what the doctor said. I need to get to the precinct. Now, what evidence did you find at Lincoln's apartment? The lab is running trace as we speak. Should get the results within an hour or so. Okay. Good because we got something else we need to deal with right now. How did the Bone Collector know so much about me, Amelia and the team, and how the hell did he know what cold cases we were investigating? I had a lot of time lying there in that bed. I dug. I figured it out. Between us, I think they're going to catch him this time. They have something new. Crosby Wilson, NYPD records, he had access to all our investigative requests, and he went to the police academy with Peter Taylor. You think he's in on it? I've been on the phone trying to find out. Nobody's seen him since the news broke yesterday about the Bone Collector's identity. If you get his phone number, - I can ping him. - Okay. Crosby Wilson is nowhere to be found. And his car is parked in the middle of nowhere? And the phone pings here for hours. I see his phone. No one leaves their phone. You know what that means. [DARK MUSIC] ♪  Well, that's a welcome surprise. Wait. So his car is just dumped here. Crosby could be anywhere. I got a bad feeling. - It's him. - How are we supposed to find clues in all of that? He wasn't here to leave clues. Look at the burn marks, fingernails. Crosby was tortured for information. What information? I don't know, but he had access to every file in the NYPD, every case, every detail, and now the Bone Collector has it. I'm working on Crosby Wilson's laptop. [KEYBOARD KEYS CLICKING] Why is my file here? All our files. Crosby gave him everything about us. You were right. That's how he knew about Nightshade. - And my wedding. - What did Crosby - think he was doing? - Apparently, he liked to comb files, solve cases before the detectives. It was a game, but he had no idea who he was playing the game with. Can you figure out what information he accessed last? - I'm trying. - Unfortunately, what I found from the jacket fibers won't help much. We got Peter Taylor's blood and skin, but the only thing of note is a high concentration of Freon. - Air-conditioning fluid. - Yeah, aerosol propellant. I mean, cars, refrigerators. I can see if I can find a specific chemical signature, try to trace it to the manufacturer. But it's used everywhere. - Right. - So we figure out what Peter Taylor wanted from Crosby. Well, clearly something Crosby didn't want him to know. He must have realized who he was dealing with. But too late. Oh, my God. That's it. The vehicle ID... assigned to the Detective Bureau Task Force. He knows Naia and Camden are being moved. I'll call it in. DB task force on the air? DB task force... go ahead. We need to pull over... been a change of plans. What do you mean? The kind we shouldn't discuss on the air with your passengers. [TENSE MUSIC] ♪  Is everything okay? Sit tight. I'll go talk to him. I don't like this. We're exposed out here. Keep a watch out through the glass. If anyone approaches, take the hell off. Don't worry about me. [TENSE MUSIC] ♪  Ah! Stay down! [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Take this. Keep it hidden, okay? - Keep it hidden. - Okay. Stay down. [GUNFIRE CONTINUES] Aah... [DARK MUSIC] ♪  [SOFT SOBBING] Shh, shh, shh. [SIREN WAILING] Eric's phone is going straight to voicemail. Backup is two minutes out. No. No, no, no, no. What? Amelia, turn on the camera. It's the driver. Where the hell are Camden and Naia? - They're gone! He took them. - He's dead. Need to call an ambulance! Oh, my God... Eric! Central, 10-13, 10-13! - Eric, pal, it's okay. - Officer down. Woodland Grove Courtland. I need an ambulance now. - 10-13! - Copy that. Hang in there, buddy. Stay with me. Stay with me. He took... took the cruiser. - He took the police cruiser? - Yeah. We'll get it. We'll get it. There was a lead cruiser in the detail. Taylor must have overtaken the officer. - Eric, I'm right here. - Central? Stay with me. I need a statewide BOLO on a Peter Taylor. - Stay with me! - He could be driving in an NYPD cruiser. You're not going to die on me, buddy. You're not going to die on me. W... w... watch... Watch? Watch what? Watch what? Hey! Eric. Eric, I'm right here. Eric. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] ♪  Eric. ♪  [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] His family came from the Dominican Republic. His old man was a cop in the five one. Caught a bullet coming out of a JCPenny on Baychester. Eric was just a kid then. Had to grow up fast. You know? Yeah. He said it made him strong... Gave him a purpose to be a detective. I'm going to miss you, my friend. I'm so sorry. We have to get him, Amelia. We have to hurt him. Make him suffer. I want to destroy him. [COOING] I'm here for you, Lincoln. He's taken everything, Claire... everything I love. They're going to find him. I know they will. - Lincoln, found the cruiser. - Show me. - Did you know him? - Kirby. Looks like a rookie. Bastard kills three cops in broad daylight. Probably waited outside the safe house. When Kirby made contact with Eric, Taylor snuck in the back of the cruiser, used a garrote. A padlock and a number sequence - on a piece of paper. - He left us clues. Still playing his damn games. Two clues. Why only two clues? Numbers on the paper. Numbers and the paper could be two separate clues. May be our only way to find Naia and Camden. Probably stole another car. I'll call it in. [NAIA WHIMPERING, PANTING] Your eyes are almost a light ash. Where's my son? He's safe, alive, for now. What was it like to be married to the great Lincoln Rhyme? Wait. You were never married to him. He couldn't let go of his first love: himself. Lincoln's going to find us. Still in denial right to the end, so sad. If only he'd been a little less self-involved. - You are meaningless to him. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. You need to conserve your energy. I turned the temperature down to 3 degrees. Hypothermia will set in soon. If Lincoln is as good as he says he is, he'll save you. But he isn't. Oh, God. Oh. Update from Sellitto: FBI and PD are ripping through traffic cams, CCTV, security footage, police reports, searching for any sign of a stolen vehicle. We don't wait... while they do their work, we do ours. - Evidence? - Padlock is basic: laminated steel with a simple tumbler release mechanism. It's sold anywhere and everywhere. - Felix? - Running Heap's algorithm to test every permutation of the string of numbers. Looking for a pattern. - Anything stand out? - Not so far. Well, the paper is bond stock butcher paper. It's uncoated, 120 grams per square meter. It's used for art projects, meat and cheese wraps. - It's common as dirt. - Prints? Trace? I have what look like skin cells. - Running them now. - Okay. Got a number pattern. Sequence matches the shipping number of a package. - What package? - Tracking, hurrying. Got it! In transit from Boise, Idaho, scheduled to arrive in Manhattan District Center tomorrow before 10. - What is it? - It's a box. 12x12x12 from Ernie's Sports Memorabilia. A box of what, Felix? There's no description of contents, no insurance. It's addressed to you here. - Find that package! - It's airborne. Intercept the flight! The FAA is never going to allow that! - I need that third clue! - Lincoln, your blood pressure. - Not now. - You'll have an attack, a real one this time. I don't care about my blood pressure. I need to find my son. I need to find Naia, and sitting here, following the clues makes me want to throw something, hit something, kick something, and I can't. He took that away from me. I won't let him take anything else. Thanks. You know, Eric took care of his family, his siblings after their parents died. I know. We had that in common. I cannot imagine how they're going to take this. What did he mean, "watch"? Maybe he was trying to warn us. You know, watch out. - Warning us about what? - I don't know. I can't get it out of my head, seeing him like that, holding his hand as he... Watch what? Stay with me, buddy. Eric! - What? - Watch... his watch, his smartwatch that he wouldn't shut up about, he just got it. - Well, what about it? - He wasn't wearing it. He took it off. What if he gave it to Camden or Naia so we could track them? - Last location of the watch. - Marcus Garvey Park, Harlem. Problem is, the signal went dead. Now maybe the Bone Collector found it, turned it off or destroyed it. But we know where he was at least. Yes, we have an area. With Sellitto and with me, it was somewhere that meant something to us. Camden was born here. Naia lived her whole life here. How does that narrow things down? Well, we have the padlock, butcher paper. And a package we can't access. We have something else... the Freon from the Bone Collector, I just finished trace on the paper. It was butcher paper from a butcher. The skin cells were meat, specifically grass-fed beef. Naia's father was a butcher, part owner of a meat locker near Morningside Park. Freon used to keep the beef cold. Padlock fits, too. And the third clue would've given us a location. Ernie's Sports Memorabilia? It's just some guy in his basement. All right? He's not answering his phone. That package could be anything, but we don't need it. We're ahead this time. Look. Eric gave us an extra clue. The meat locker is near Marcus Garvey Park. Harlem Meats... it's right by the park. [PHONE VIBRATING] FBI ALERT: car with plates matching to a stolen vehicle spotted at Marcus Garvey Park. We need to go now before they freeze to death! [DRAMATIC MUSIC] ♪  Lincoln, we got her. - Naia. - I don't see any wires. It doesn't look rigged. She's alive Lincoln... we got to get her core temperature up. Guys, in here! Naia, it's okay. You're safe. We're getting you out of here. Where's Camden? Where's Camden? Camden. Lincoln, I don't see anything. Give me a full 360. He's here. Stop. See that light? He left a note. "One last game. You know where to find me. Come alone." As far as I can tell, it's only a map. There's nothing highlighted, nothing circled, no X marks the spot. Okay. Why does he think I'll know where? Because it has meaning. Okay? If this is his endgame, then it's going to have meaning to you just like the Marcy had meaning to Sellitto, just like the meat locker had meaning to Naia. The whole city has meaning to me: where I trained, where I caught the Tourist Killer. The first body I found... that was the Bone Collector! The night we met. Only good thing ever to come out of the Bone Collector. But it has to have meaning to me and Camden. It could be 100 things. I don't know. Hospital says Naia' doing well: minor frostbite, no cognitive loss. But she has no idea where he took Camden? No. She said, "Please just find him." Amelia, you understand Peter Taylor almost as well as I do. I need you to profile. What does he do next? What is Camden most afraid of? He's a kid... it could be anything. Yeah, but the Bone Collector trapped me in the scariest place I know... my living nightmare. He threatened to take me outside. Okay. So is there a place on a map that Camden is afraid of? Kid had no fear until the Bone Collector came into our lives. The minute he saw his father chasing a serial killer all over New York... Maybe it's that... the kills. We know where those are. Yeah. I can mark them off on the map. I don't need them marked to know where they are. Give me a minute. I have seen Camden afraid: when he came to the hospital and saw me this way. - What hospital? - Not the hospital. Pull up the warehouse where he did this to me. - It should be right there. - He erased it. Well, the clue wasn't what is on the map. It's what's not there. He wants to take me back to where this started. That's where it ends. - I'll call ESU. - No. I have to go alone. - You know that's a trap. - Of course it's a trap. I don't tell you how to do your job, but dying is not going to help Camden. You are not going in there alone. No, I'm not. Amelia, get the camera rig. ♪  You're going in alone, but we are your eyes and your ears. Okay. I can live with that. What if he finds you're rigged or takes it? That's why I need your help. We'll make adjustments. I can't save Camden alone. I can't catch the Bone Collector alone. I didn't realize that three years ago. This time, I do, and I'm not alone. [INTENSE MUSIC] ♪  I know that bomb. Timer is not running. Recognize that bomb, Lincoln? It's one of our old favorites. It's wired to the door. Same is true for every other door. If your friends try and breach their way in, there won't be enough of them left to bury. Bomb squad is here, Lincoln. I'm bringing them the image. No way he's had time to rig the whole damn place. Find another way in. Hey. Hey! We got to get in there. Kate, do the blueprints of the warehouse tell us anything? I'm looking. Maybe there's a way around the bomb. This place bring back old memories? Only this time, you can't come up. Find Camden, Lincoln. We need to see more of the setup to figure out how to get him out. No need to hide... I came alone... mano a mano. You're earlier than I expected. We were able to find Naia without your damn clues. Good thing I saved the worst for the last. You won't save your son. So many things in life bring us full circle. Camden! - What did you do to him? - Oh, my God. Gave him a harmless little sleeping pill. He was talking too much, like father, like son. - Let him go! - Come on, Lincoln. You know the game. You figure out how to set him free before I switch the remote for the trap door and he falls through. You think it'll crush his spinal cord like you did or just die while you watch? Ticktock, Lincoln. The end is nigh. You know you're not getting out of this. I realize that. I kill him. I kill you. Then when they breach their way inside, - I'll die in the rubble... - Got the remote? - The clear winner and loser. - Got it. Our names inextricably linked together forever. Researching. Let me ask you something, Lincoln. Have you figured it out yet... why? What you've done to deserve all this? - You want to know the truth? - Lincoln, Felix needs more time with the remote. Sellitto needs more time with the bomb squad. You need to keep him talking, so you have to let him draw the story out. I haven't figured it out, so if I'm going to die for my sins, you might as well tell me what they are. Sabin Baldridge. Killed four women at Coney Island. I cracked that case at the Academy. I cracked that case at the Academy! I did! You were always so full of yourself. You never saw any of the other students. You just cared about you being the smartest person in the room. It was a competition. We had 24 hours, and I solved it first! I walked in to tell Captain Olsen that Sabin Baldridge was our man, but you pushed right by me and shouted the answer! I'm hacking the remote. I can jam the signal, but I need a few more seconds. We don't have a few more seconds. If the bomb blows, you'll be in blast range. I wanted to show how valuable I was, but instead... I got cut from the Academy. The program was designed to weed out students! We all knew that. You think if I said Sabin Baldridge first, I wouldn't have been head of the class? No, because if you had it in you, you would've gotten the answer before I did. You're baiting me. I've got the power here. This is my power. He's covering... he was killing before the Academy. - Got something. - Blaming me. Do you actually believe that? Because we both know you were killing years before you met me. It's who you are. You think you understand me, Lincoln? There's a faster way. Maintenance record show there's an exhaust ceiling that removed for repairs three weeks ago... it's a way in. All right. Stand down. We're going to try another way. Your new partner, Amelia Sachs, give you statistics on people like me? - There are no people like me! - You think you're special? Do you think the childhood trauma you endured is worse than others? You think the compulsion you feel is different than others? You want to know the truth? I just tried it... and I liked it, and... I don't know why. Ask Amelia. She'll tell you. It's what makes me me! Lincoln, keep him talking. His wife. You're not fully human. A man who could take his wife and squeeze the life out of her, cut off her fingers... I didn't kill Danielle! You did! You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd like it to be my fault! You chose to kill her, the one person who ever loved you! - Stop it! - Admit it. The compulsion came over you, and you killed her. It was fun for you. You killed your own wife - because you liked it! - No, I didn't! Stop talking about her! Stop it! Recognize this, Lincoln? Can you hear me? - [WHIMPERS] - [KNIFE IMPACTS] I should've killed you with this three years ago. Now I'm going to do it after you watch Camden fall. - Please. - To join you. - Please don't. - It'll all be over soon. Please don't! Don't! Felix, is it done? - Seconds away. - Please don't! - [BEEP] - [WHINING TONE] - [BEEP] - [WHINING TONE] - [BEEP, BEEP] - [TONE] Are they coming, Lincoln? Are your friends coming to save you? Have they been watching us? Are you wearing that clever little camera? Yes, you are, aren't you? Okay. That's fine. ♪ Every day, it's getting... ♪ I want to say something to Detective Sellitto! You were too late three years ago! You're going to be too late today! Sellitto, Sachs, say good-bye to Lincoln. - Ugh! - Aah! Aah! Aah! [INTENSE MUSIC] ♪  ♪ True love from me ♪ ♪ Every day, things are getting closer ♪ ♪ Going faster than a roller coaster ♪ What have you done? Lincoln! Get Camden. Hey. Wake up. Hey. Hey. You're okay. Guess we weren't too late. He's going to help you. Okay? Kate put a fast-acting paralytic in the camera. Tell me... how does it feel to be trapped inside your own body? Already you can't feel your arms or your legs. What I wanted: for you to die. But that would be giving you what you wanted, so now you'll go to trial for all that you've done so people can see you lost. You failed. [STRANGLED GASPS] - You did it, Lincoln. - No. We did it. We all did it. Peter Taylor, you're under arrest. [HANDCUFFS CLINKING] Naia, I'm sorry for putting you and Camden in jeopardy. My life, what I do... Lincoln, the doctor said it would be best for him to stay where he feels safe, and he wanted to be here with you. I told Mom you'd come. You'd save us both, and you did. He's going to be in jail for the rest of his life. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Maybe we can move back here, to New York. We'll talk about that later. Why don't you focus on getting some rest? I'll come back and check on you in a bit. There's someone I have to thank. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I'd like to raise a toast to my partner, Detective Eric Castillo, a good cop, a hero who left us today, much too soon... But he helped us catch the Bone Collector. He put his life on the line to protect my family. I am forever grateful. [CLEARS THROAT] To Eric! To Eric! Amelia, will you do the honor, the end-of-watch call? Yeah. Central, 10-84, we are present at the location. DB task force, DB task force. All units be advised: Detective Eric Castillo was killed in the line of duty today. Detective Castillo is now 10-42, gone but not forgotten. Eric, we have the watch from here. Present arms. Order arms. I really can't face going home right now. How about another round? I'm in. Where did this package come from? I didn't see this earlier. It's addressed to you, Lincoln. 12x12x12. The third clue? Well, how is that possible? Well, it's been tampered with. Someone must have intercepted it. Yeah, but how did they get it here? The Bone Collector is locked up. [PHONE RINGS] Phone? [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] Hello? Congratulations on catching the Bone Collector, Lincoln. Sorry about your friend. You and your esteemed team trying to figure out if you know me. Let me give you a little clue. You do. How'd you get this package? You really do need to upgrade your security, Felix. What do you want? I have a murder for you to solve. - What murder? - If you'd kindly step outside, all will be clear. I'll check the roof. You think you can catch me, Lincoln? Think again. [DARK, INTENSE MUSIC]
