 Maverick (1957â€“1962): Season 1, Episode 3 - According to Hoyle - full transcript 
 A Southern belle targets Bret and cleans him out at poker. Bret gets staked to switch to a different paddle-wheeler, so she'll follow, and plenty spectators will too. Different riverboat, same result. Samantha Crawford explains that Bret took her father for $50,000 - who embezzled to cover his losses and is now in prison. Samantha's raising money to make restitution, but she's still short, and Bret's broke again. As Pappy said "man's the only animal that can get skinned more than once," so Bret proposes they combine forces.

 - You and me gotta have a little talk. - Trouble? Aye, coming from that direction. Riggs has got this town sorted like a mattress. I didn't think we'd meet again so soon, Maverick. I did, Mr. Riggs. Boys tell me a lot of gaming equipment came in this morning. - Yours? - Didn't your boys tell you that? They didn't have to. Now that I see you, I can add two and two together. It will never come out four. Not the way you deal. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

 I'll take two, please. I'll try one. Three, please. Opener bet's 200. I'm out. I think there's an expression in poker. I'll tap you, Mr. Maverick. There is 3500... and since you're tapping me, I believe I'd better add this. Well, $1000. I've never seen one before. That's your pot, Miss Crawford. Thank you. I, uh, think it's about time for me to quit.

 You cash me in, please. Thank you. Good night. I've had enough excitement for one night. You want me to cash you in, Miss Crawford. Mr. Maverick? Good night. Please. Mr. Maverick. You had quite a run of bad luck. Maybe I played badly. Well, that isn't saying much for my ability. You're a bad poker player, Miss Crawford. I expected you to be a good loser. Is anyone? No one likes to lose. Especially to a woman, huh? Your sex has nothing to do with your poker. Two times you bet into my possible straight and raised me. Perhaps I guessed you were bluffing. And you were. Here you are, Miss Crawford, $11,200. - Well, thank you. - Good night. Goodnight, Mr. Maverick. New Orleans a real fine place to be... when you've got some money in your pocket. I hadn't. Good morning, sir. May I help you? It might be the other way around. I understand you gentlemen own the Stonewall Jackson. We do. Business seems a little slow. I thought the Stonewall Jackson... was scheduled to leave for St. Louis tomorrow morning. Your information is correct, sir. - Would you like to book passage? - I would. Providing I get $5000 from you gentlemen. You have a strange sense of humor, sir. Maybe I better introduce myself. My name is Bret Maverick. - Maverick, well, you're the one who... - Who lost $12,000... to a lovely and charming lady named Samantha Crawford. Miss Crawford is booking passage back to St. Louis on the Delta Star. Now, the Delta Star is not one of your packets. And it looks like you haven't sold too many tickets on the Stonewall Jackson. But Delta Star is almost sold out. You're not telling us anything we don't know. - Now, you listen to me... - What is your point, Mr. Maverick? To return to St. Louis on the Stonewall Jackson. Everybody expects me to take the Delta Star because Miss Crawford will be on it. A lot of people would like to find out if Miss Crawford was just lucky... or a better poker player than I am. Is she? - She's one of the worst I've ever seen. - She took you for 12,000. So she did and curiosity being what it is... you can jam the Stonewall Jackson... from stem to stern with people wondering if she can do it again. - And the 5000 you mention? - A stake. If I win, you'll get your money back. Miss Crawford cleaned me. That being the case... how do you know she will switch to the Jackson or even play again. Maybe the lady doesn't want to push her luck. Miss Crawford was particularly anxious to take my money. She stayed in the pots when I did and she dropped when I did. She will play again. Why was she out to get you? Well, that's something I hope to find out. I've never seen her before in my life. This whole thing sounds like a flim-flam to me. What's to prevent you from losing to her again on purpose? - What about you? - The same thought occurred to me. I'll find a stake and book passage on the Delta Star. - Hi, gentlemen. - Come on in. Hey, we wanna talk to you. The Stonewall Jackson sailed the next evening... with a full passenger list, including Miss Samantha Crawford. Good evening, Mr. Maverick. Gentlemen, may I? - It's an honor, Mr. Kittredge. - Thank you. - Good evening, gentlemen. - That chair is taken. - It appears empty to me. - We're waiting for someone. All right, we'll pull up another one later. We don't want you in the game, Mr. Riggs. - You and me meet before? - Indirectly. You're Joe Riggs. I watched you in a game in Wagon Wheel, Wyoming. So? It was in your place, The Golden Bucket. It was a crooked game. You're not a very careful talker. But careful who sits the game with me. But I'll leave it up to the other gentlemen at the table if they want you in, I'll bow out. Mr. Maverick's word is good enough for me, gentlemen. As far as I'm concerned, we're filled. Looks like we're filled. - We'll see each other again. - That's likely, Mr. Riggs. - Miss Crawford. - Good evening. Mr. Maverick, gentlemen. Good evening, Miss Crawford. Mr. Kittredge would you do us the honor of banking the game? I'd be happy to, Mr. Maverick. Agreed Miss Crawford? Gentlemen? Uh, these stacks will be $5000. Will you help yourselves? Thank you. High card deals, dealer calls the game, satisfactory? Certainly. Your luck still holds, Miss Crawford. I defer to the ace, gentlemen. Your deal, Miss Crawford. Uh, gentlemen, before we begin, I'd like one thing clearly understood. Now, as we did before, we play according to Hoyle? You make quite a point out of it. Well, it's a man's world, men make the rules. I haven't any objection to that as long as they all abide by them equally. - According to Hoyle, Miss Crawford. - Thank you, Mr. Kittredge. Well, since I have choice of the game... how would like to play five cards stud? Well, now, that's a man's game. Ready, deuce... seven, six... four and another deuce. Your pair of nines are high, Miss Crawford. Five hundred. I'll call and raise 500. Fold. I'll call. Well, I'll see your raise and raise another thousand. You have a lot of faith in a pair of nines, Miss Crawford. Sure have. Call. Uh, the way my luck's been running... I can't buck a possible straight or even a pair of nines. I'm over. Last card. Queen to Miss Crawford. Ten to Mr. Maverick, possible straight. Your pair of nines are still high on the board, Miss Crawford. Your bet. A thousand dollars. I'll call and raise 2000. As I recall Mr. Maverick, you sometimes bluff. You need a nine. I have two showing, one was turned down. I don't know the exact odds you have on that fourth nine... but, um, well, how much do you have there? Sixteen thousand. Well, in that case, if you don't mind... I'll just raise you 16,000. I'll call, 16,000. You're looking at my hand, Mr. Maverick, a pair of nines. I wasn't bluffing, Miss Crawford. Sorry, I do have the nine. I didn't think you were, Mr. Maverick. And you raised in to me? According to Hoyle, remember. "In five card stud poker, straights are not played... unless determined at the commencement of the game... that they be admitted." See for yourself, Mr. Maverick. Miss Crawford, I've been playing poker a long time... - straights have always been... - Well, not in stud poker... according to Hoyle, that is. Stewart, would you bring the copy of Hoyle from the bar, please? You see, straights are played only when... table rules allow them and we made no table rules. - Do you mind if I check the boat's copy? - Oh, certainly not. Your pot, Miss Crawford. Congratulations and good night. - May I have my money, Mr. Kittredge? - Yes, ma'am. I imagine you have your suspicions, gentlemen. Well, not at all. Both Mr. Hayes and I checked carefully. You have an impeccable reputation for honesty. I'm afraid that's all I have left. Now, Mr. Maverick, what now? I owe you... $5000. No, sir. You drew more fares than that. We took our chances with you. It was a stake not a loan. I owe you $5000 and I intend to repay it. Good night Mr. Bledsoe, Mr. Hayes. Good night. Straight bourbon. You know something? I think we're gonna get our money back. May I ask a question, Miss Crawford? Why me, Miss Crawford? Why were you out to get me? - Was I? - Ha, ha. Oh, yes. Coming down the river, you played every pot I did and you dropped when I did. Threw me off my game. First time it's ever been done. Well, I sure hope it'll be the last, Mr. Maverick. Well, like I said before, you're a bad poker player, Miss Crawford. But you had that one trick. And you were waiting to nail me with it. Why not Kittredge or one of the others? All right, I'll tell you. You once won $50,000 from a man name George Cross. That was all the money he had in the world. Later, to make good his loss, he embezzled money from his bank. Today he's in the Kansas State Penitentiary. Because you cheated him at poker. - Is that what he said? - Yes. Then he's a liar. He's my father. I'm sorry. But you played poker with me. Do you think I cheat? No. I remember George Cross who played good cards badly and bad cards worse. Well, you took his money. Yes, but believe me, I never played in a game... with anyone I didn't think could afford to lose. Well, that doesn't help him now. I suppose not. I'd like to help you, Miss Crawford. What can I do? Well, I need another $25,000 to make good what he took. - And if you get it? - They'll release him. Looks like we both need money. I need 5000 to repay a debt. And you need 25. Any idea how you'll get yours? It's a cinch that Hoyle trick won't work again. By the time we dock in St. Louis, the story will be all over the river. In a week, everybody in the territory will know it. But maybe there's another way. What do you mean? There is a man on the boat named Joe Riggs, you know him? - No. - Owns a joint in Wagon Wheel, Wyoming. Never played a street deck in his life. So? A man like that doesn't deserve to live as well as he does. You don't like him, is that it? I believe I would have put it stronger. I was once tempted to give the people in Wagon Wheel an honest game... but it meant staying too long in one place so I moved on. I propose a partnership, Miss Crawford, you and I. Only I haven't got a nickel. Oh, well... - uh, that makes it a little one-sided. - Maybe. But how else will you get your 25,000? You need me and I need you. Well, how much would it take? 10,000 would set us up with the newest and best equipment. The split? Everything above the 5000 and what I lost before is yours. I wouldn't want to stay with it any longer than that. All right, Mr. Maverick, when do you need the money? As soon as we dock. Well, this is to be a first name partnership. - Mine's Samantha. - Mine's Bret. And goodnight, Bret. The Stonewall Jackson paddled into St. Louis, right on schedule. And I went hunting for equipment. - Who is it? BRET: It's Bret, you all. Well, I've arranged to buy all the equipment we need. Goes out by freight this afternoon. And I got it for a thousand dollars less than I figured. Well, isn't that nice? Then you need $9000. Here, you can count it if you like. Samantha, you know I trust you. We can take tomorrow morning's train for Kansas city, change there for Cheyenne. Take a stage on from there to Wagon Wheel. I telegraphed a friend of mine, he'll be there to take care of the equipment. Is anything wrong, Bret? Well, I was just wondering if your father would approve? Oh. - I will take care of that. - You know, it's rough where we're going. Might be better if you just stay right here in St. Louis. Bret, that's so thoughtful of you... but, well, I just kind of prefer to keep an eye on my investment, you know? Yeah, well, I'll get the tickets, partner. - Yes. MAN: Telegram for Samantha Crawford. - What do you want? - Please, Miss Crawford, may I? - Who are you? - My name is Henry Tree. Mr. Cross sent me. Please forgive the telegram subterfuge. - And you have been watching me? - Yes, well, I am paid to do so. A detective? Yes, and one of the best, if I may say so. Miss Crawford, I am afraid that Mr. Cross is not going to understand... the deal you made with Mr. Maverick. Heh, what deal? Well, I overheard you on the Stonewall Jackson. And Mr. Maverick left here only just a moment ago. And I followed him this morning. He was quite busy visiting establishments that sell gambling equipment. Well, does Mr. Cross have to know? Oh, my dear, yes. You see, I have a certain loyalty towards my clients. - Here is, um, $5000. - Mm. - A lot of money. - Does Mr. Cross still have to know? Oh, I am afraid he already knows. You see, I made a full report and he should be here in... Hello, Samantha. Mr. Tree tells me you have been a very busy girl. Tree also tells me you won 25,000 dollars. Ten percent of that is 2500. Your share. Uh, Mr. Cross, I believe, you'll find quite a bit of that money missing. You gave it to Maverick. You are gonna get it back. May I say something? Please do, Mr. Tree. Mr. Maverick probably no longer has the money. You see, he is on his way right now to pay for the gambling equipment. That's Miss Crawford's problem. - She is gonna get it back. - But why should she? She double crossed you, or at least she tried. And inadvertently, she made it possible for you to realize a much better profit... than you expected. - We let her go right ahead. - Exactly. And you will reap the benefit of her keen imagination. No, you don't. I made that deal with Maverick, it was my idea. - So it was. - What are you doing? - Taking my money, Samantha. - Your money? Only a women could have pulled that Hoyle trick and gotten away with it. A lady with my southern charm. I want my share. You got it. You gave it and more to Maverick. I'll go to Maverick, tell him the whole thing... That it was a scheme to make a sucker out of him. Oh, he'll love you for that, Samantha. He'll tie that money in a red ribbon, put it right in your hands. And then thank you for making him look like an idiot, ha, ha. Oh, you aced yourself right down the river, honey. I want my share or I'll... May I suggest that you need each other? If Miss Crawford goes to Mr. Maverick... tells him the story, she'll end up without a nickel. Yet you Mr. Cross, you need her. For she is your only link with a man... who can set you up in a very profitable business. So I suggest that you come to some sort of an agreement. - Ten percent. - Fifty. - Twenty-five percent. - I said 50. You better take 25 percent while I am still in a mood to be generous. Uh, he is being very reasonable, Miss Crawford. Twenty-five for you, 50 for Mr. Cross and 25 for me. Well, after all, we three share a very interesting secret. The journey from St. Louis to Wyoming... is long and rough, but mostly just long. And I was a little worried about Samantha, but she made the trip almost a pleasure. She took it all in with wide eyes and a wider smile. And had me looking at places I have never really noticed before. This, uh, isn't exactly New Orleans, Samantha. Oh, I didn't expect it to be, Bret. - Maverick, it's good to see you lad. - Mike, how are you? Samantha, this is Big Mike McComb. Mike, I wrote you about Miss Crawford. That you did, but you didn't write half enough. - Well, I hope we'll be friends, Mike. - There is nothing stopping it, ma'am. - Well, excuse me. - See you later. She's got to be Irish with a face like that. She is an angel, but an angel. Play poker with her sometime. - You and me got to have a little talk. - Trouble? Aye, coming from that direction. Riggs has got this town sorted like a mattress. Our equipment? Wagon this morning. But you got no place to put it, Bret. Nobody rent you enough space to deal a 200 Black Jack game. I didn't think we'd meet again so soon, Maverick. I did, Mr. Riggs. Boys tell me a load of gaming equipment came in this morning. - Yours? - Didn't your boys tell you that. They didn't have to. Now that I see you, I can add two and two together. It will never come out four, not the way you deal. You kept me out of that game on the boat... but here in Wagon Wheel, I run the table. Now, what were you saying about renting a place? Might be a place, belongs to a woman called Ma Braus. Where will I find her? Just outside of town. Probably wasting your time talking to her. As Pappy used to say, faint heart never filled the flush. Point me in her direction. You are just wasting your time, son. You can talk till you're blue in the face. I don't hold with gambling, drinking, or them that does. - I never drink, Ma. - But you gamble. - Only honestly. - Gambling is gambling. Don't you wanna see Joe Riggs closed up? Oh, the devil will get him some day. I would like to help. The devil does plenty of business in this town, he don't need you. Riggs is crooked, you know that. But there ain't nobody ever proved it. That's because nobody's ever gonna up against him. Think what he did to your husband. Found out a lot about me, didn't you? Everything I could. Riggs took all your husband's money. Left you with just this house and that old building I want to rent. What makes you think you can put Riggs out of business? All I want is the chance. He owns this town. Don't you think it's about time somebody took it away from him? You talk big. You better pack up your duds and head out of Wagon Wheel. You are young yet. You got a lot of life waiting for you. But not if you try to buck Joe Riggs. Ma, if I don't rent your place, I'll open a game in a tent. And they'll bury you in it. I hear everyone likes you, Ma, do almost anything for you. I just thought you might like to repay the favor. I guess not. Sorry I took your time. Hold on. I seen a lot of men come and go. Big talkers and them that didn't talk at all. Cowards, brave men... - some in between. - Where do you figure I fit in, Ma? I don't know. But I am gonna rent you that building and find out. Come in the kitchen, I'll brew you some coffee. Everything is all set, Samantha. I've rented a place. Just sent Mike to take out an ad in the local paper. - Oh, when do we open? - Tomorrow or the next day. Depends on how fast we get the equipment in. Uh, Bret, there's just one little thing. Yeah, what? Well, I gave you $9000... and, uh, I just don't have a thing to show for it. What do you want, a receipt? Oh, I don't want you to go to any trouble. Why don't you just give me the bills of sale? Thank you. Have you heard from your father? - No, no, I haven't. - Did you write to him? Oh, yes, I always write. Well, did you tell him what you were gonna do? Uh, no, why? Oh, I was just wondering. - What's that? What? - Handbills. Fellow turned green when I told him I wanted to take out an ad. He's scared of Riggs. Finally talked him into printing those. "Grand opening, The Square Deck, games of chance... $5000 reward to anyone who finds a dishonest game. No other place in town can make that offer." These will do it. - We'll start passing them out today. - We? You don't think anybody else in this town is gonna do it. Take a handful, Mike. See you later, Samantha. Gentlemen, gentlemen, gather around, I got news for you. The Square Deck. Guarantee a fair shake and an honest deal for everyone. When do you open? Open in Ma Braus' tomorrow night. It's all true, gentlemen, The Square Deck gives a fair shake to everyone. Tell your friends. Find out what it's like to play with honest cards. Here you are, boys, pass them around. - When do you open? - Tomorrow, maybe the next day. - Where? - Ma Braus' old building. Tell your friends. Better than that, bring your friends. - All right, step right up. - All right, Maverick. I gave you a fair warning when you come in, Maverick. - Leave them be, Riggs. - Leave them be? Boys, this is Bret Maverick. Let him open a place here and he'll have your eye teeth in a week. You boys know how I hate a crooked card man. Well, he is it. They know all about him down in the river country. I ain't letting nobody move in here and take your hides. I always try to give you boys a square shake. I got a sign on my place. Says you can have your money back if you think I don't, right? Now, wait a minute. Hold. I think I can take care of him myself. Take him, Mike. Take him. Stop it. They're done, Joe. Leave them at the edge of town. They try to get in again, finish them. What are you doing here? You give me those. I take it you got these from our former associate, Mr. Maverick. You saw the affair in the street and being a very intelligent young lady... you came to exactly the same conclusion that occurred to me. - Give me those, get out of here. - Am I right? You were about to dissolve your partnership... and offer Mr. Riggs a deal. I can hardly blame you. But you do have two other partners, Miss Crawford. Mr. Cross and myself. Mr. Tree, you and I have the bills of sale, George doesn't even have to be in... My, how you twist and turn. You know, I told you, I have a certain loyalty toward my clients. We'll... We'll wait for Mr. Cross, here. Is George here? That's stupid. Maverick will recognize him, then where are we? I rather doubt Mr. Maverick can recognize anybody now... and besides, what difference does it make? Obviously, we over-estimated his abilities. Or under-estimated Mr. Riggs. And as I said, we wait for Mr. Cross here. And then perhaps the three of us can see Riggs. Excuse me. Uh-uh... Thank you. - Now you just hold it. - Easy. Easy. Well, you look a lot better than when I found you. We're walking now, that's the difference. We are headed right back into town. Now you are not talking sense at all. You are both lucky Riggs didn't have you killed. - Aren't you worried about him? - Why should I be? He won't take kindly to you picking us up and bringing us here. There's one thing Joe Riggs knows. If he so much as laid a finger on me... he'd have to answer to every miner and cow hand in this valley. - That's nice to know. - I don't know what you mean by that. But there's a stage out of here leaving tomorrow morning, you better be riding it. Ma? How would you like to take us back into town close to the hotel? Without Riggs seeing us. Oh, I wouldn't take you too near that place. Not till after dark. Yeah. - Somebody to see you, boss. - Excuse me. - May I? - Who are you and what do you want? Uh, my name is Cross, Miss Crawford, Mr. Tree. We're Maverick's partners. May be you didn't see what happened to Maverick. But we did. That's why we're here. Maybe you better listen to what I've got to say. You have got nothing to say, mister. These are bills of sale for equipment that Maverick had shipped here. He won't be using it. You don't know Maverick. He won't quit. He just did, little while ago. Would you like to bet on that, Mr. Riggs? My dear Mr. Riggs, we don't wish to put to you out of business... but if we stay lined up with Mr. Maverick, I'm afraid you might find that you are. Exactly. We have the money to buy... well, all the help Maverick will need if it comes to a fight. What's your deal? We'll sell the equipment to you at a small profit to us. Let me see the bills of sale. You paid 9000. We are willing to let you have it for 20,000. Some deck's got a joker missing. Well, Mr. Riggs, without equipment or money Mr. Maverick won't have a chance... but with it, heh, I'm afraid he won't quit till he runs you out of business. You seem pretty sure of Maverick. What will you tell him, in case I accept your offer? We don't tell him anything. He'll be out in the cold without knowing how he got there. I could fight you, but I am willing to go the easy way. I always wanted to get big, and with this equipment, I can do it. But not for 20,000 or even 5. I'll give you 10 percent of the Golden Bucket... for the next three years that could come to twice what you're asking. - Put that in writing. - I will. As soon as you sign these bills of sale over to me. Suppose, we both start writing at the same time. Good evening, partners. I see you, Mr. Cross. I imagine you know your daughter and I've already met. Gee, it must be nice to have dear old dad back again. Quite a relief to be out of the penitentiary, huh? All right, Maverick, so you know the story. I knew it all along. I am not likely to forget a man who lost $50,000 to me. Somehow you just don't seem like the type to have a lovely daughter like Samantha. So, what are you going to do about it? Well, I could knock your head off. But then, what'd be the use? No, I am perfectly happy just being a partner. But you are not. That true Samantha? Uh... I'm afraid so, Bret. You know Samantha, it's kind of hard keeping track of you. You made a deal with Riggs, huh? Kind of thought so when I saw you coming out of his office. I waited a long time to get even with you and I did it. Nobody ever cheated me and got away with it. And nobody ever called me a cheat and got away with it. Well, what next? Bret there is nothing you can do. We bought in with Riggs and we didn't steal anything from you. I guess that's true. I don't think I could tell anybody that you stole that equipment from me. Well, hardly, it was my money that bought it. Right again. Samantha. You just proved something my old papa used to tell me. Man's the only animal you can skin more than once. Good night, partner. I waited a long time for this. It was worth it. Wonder what he'll do now. I hope he goes into the Riggs place and gets his brains beat out. What's the matter, Samantha, you got a soft spot for him? - Well, Brett? - Whipsawed, Mike. Ten ways from Sunday. - They're sneaking double-crossers. - Whipsawed, but not licked. You said something this evening that interested me. - When I called you a fool? - Among other things. Think you could walk into Riggs' place and get away with it? - I could, why? - What if Mike and I walked in with you? - I'll be at the wake. - Let's go, Ma. What are you gonna do? Wait, wait. Wait, Bret. You're foolish just walking into his place. Well done, my boy. How is it going, man, everything fine? Yeah, tomorrow's another day, heh. Evening, Joe. - Outside you two. - Take it easy Riggs. I just came in for a friendly game of Black Jack, you can't object to that. - I do. - Hold on. This here is a friend of mine. Boys, can't a friend of mine play if he wants to. Why don't you want me to play, Riggs? Well? Go ahead. I don't mind using the same deck. We'll break a new one. We'll use the same one. If it was all right for these gentlemen, it's all right for me. Go ahead, deal. All right, now, let's see, I got a ten and a six. Ordinarily I'd stand on 16. Since that top card's a five or under, I'll take it. Go ahead, deal it, Riggs. - What are you trying to do? - Show you up for a crook. Face card. Twenty six and nine. Face card. Five or under. Now, don't feel too bad, gentlemen. Mr. Riggs uses only the newest and best marked cards. You can study him for a week and not find anything if you didn't know what to look for. Now, let's take a look at the Faro setup. Or do we have to? And that Roulette. How much did you pay for that rigged Roulette wheel? Fine, move it, over there. You know, I remember a crooked place in New Orleans. You know what happened to it? A customer smashed it to bits. Hold it. Hold it. Now, hold it gentlemen. I could have killed him before if that's what I wanted. Turn him over to us, that's all. Then I'd have turn you over to the sheriff. Now, go on home, men. Riggs is through short-carding and second-dealing you. - Go on. - Let's go boys, fun's over. - He's got bills of sale for the equipment. - Give me those. - They're signed over to me. - I know Riggs. The stuff's yours. You won't be doing anything with them. Not west of the Mississippi when the story gets around. Hold on now. I never thought I'd live to see an honest gambler and I did. I guess I owe you something for this, son. Joe, I'll buy those bills of sale from you. I'll give you $2000. It's all the money I got in the world. - They worth nine. - They ain't worth a brass cent to you. You'll take the 2000. I'll meet you at the bank in the morning and give you the money. What're you gonna do with that equipment? I'm gonna start an honest place. You want a job, don't you? Well, I can't run a gambling place by myself. Mike will help you, Ma, he's the expert. You got anything better to do? No. I don't know what kind of a cut Riggs gave you, whatever it was... chalk it up to profit and loss. - I sure wish you'd stay, son. - Mike will take care of you, Ma. Mike says you need $5000 real bad. Does he? I think you earned all that and a whole lot more. So as soon as I've got that much to spare, where shall I send it? To a couple of New Orleans ship owners by the name of Bledsoe and Hayes. Mike's got the address. And thanks, Ma. Have you got enough money right now? Oh, thanks. I've got just enough. Allow me? Excuse me. Take care of my girl, Mike. Hyah! It's a long way to Kansas city. High card deals. - Seven of clubs. - Ten of diamonds. Ten of hearts. Ace of spades.
