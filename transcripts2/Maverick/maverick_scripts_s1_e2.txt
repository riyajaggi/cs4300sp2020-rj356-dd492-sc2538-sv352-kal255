 Maverick (1957â€“1962): Season 1, Episode 2 - Point Blank - full transcript 
 Kicked out of one town, jailed for running a con in the next, Bret's luck turns when a sultry waitress eases him out of stir to work as a spotter in a casino. A cattle drive's heading to Bent Fork, so the casino's soon jammed with drunken cowpokes raring to cheat at cards and start shooting. Bret's sharp benefactor Molly proves an alluring mystery: why's she staying in the hottest, driest town in the West, since she has two quick-tempered suitors already, the straight-arrow sheriff and a bank clerk?

 Turn around. I don't think I'll need this. As long as I aim to teach you a lesson, you want to stay alive to remember it. All right. Go ahead. Now, hold it a minute. The way it looks... if you end up on your back, your partner pulls the trigger on me. Now, you boys say I cost you a lot of money. All right, maybe I did. But I can show you how you can get it all back... and a lot more to keep it company.

Looks like you've had quite a ride. In that sun, crossing the street would be quite a ride. - What'll you have? - Nothing, thanks. I just came in to get out of the heat. Feel like eating? Not unless you carry a line of free food. - Mm. Down on your luck, huh? - No, just broke. And there's quite a difference. You may not believe me...

 The way he jumped, you'd have thought it was his pants was on fire. Someday he's gonna hand you your teeth. Old Charlie? Ah-ha-ha. He likes it. Makes him one of the boys. Pour me a drink, will you, Mike? - What are you trying to do? - Oh, hello there. I saw a fellow over in Dodge do this one day. The idea is to push a stick through one of the loops... so that it comes out inside the belt when you unroll it. Oh, there's nothing to it. Right through there. No, I'd say you're wrong. I'd say this one. Well, don't tell me that. Here, I'll show you. Go ahead, pull her out. What did I tell you? Nothing to it if you got a good eye. My friend, you were just lucky. Lucky? Roll her up again. You wouldn't like to make a little bet this time? Say, uh, a dollar? You know, I'd be afraid to say no. Roll her up. - You finished? - Well, hello. Well, hello, finally. - Do I know you? - Well, now, I like that. Just who do you think's been waiting on you all this time? - You? - Me. I must have been hungrier than I thought. When's the last time you ate? Well, I was run out of Prairie Springs night before last, about 38 hours. Run out of Prairie Springs? Little misunderstanding that I didn't have time to straighten out. I'll get your change. Well, I won't be hard to find. As soon as I clean up, you can find me at that friendly green table. Oh, would you give this to...? Oh, I didn't get his name. The Moose? What for? He didn't know it at the time, but he made me a small loan. There's $10 here, you only took him for 5. I got a delicate conscience. Moose's case, there's no need for it. If it had been anybody else, I'd have stopped you. Out of the way. You! Stand up, mister. I'm gonna make you dance. I said stand up. You're gonna do a jig for my friends. Put that gun away, Moose. I got $10 here that he... You gonna stand up? - Who did the shooting, Mike? - It was him. He stole $5 from me. Moose did most of the shooting, Wes. Well... I think Moose and I can settle the problem, sheriff. That's right. He gave me $10 for you, Moose. Well, come on, the both of you. We can talk this over in the office. How long do you plan to keep me in here? Put up bail, you can leave now. How much bail? Well, I try to encourage confidence men to stay out of Bent Forks. The bail's $100. That's a little more than I've got. Well, the circuit judge's coming through here in about 10 days. You got a pretty good story. He might let you off with a warning. You know, you must have a pretty low opinion of this town. The belt game went out with the Civil War. - Hi, Chris. - Hi, Molly. - You got a prisoner without a hat? - Yeah. - That's all right. I'll take it. - Okay. Rise up, Mr. Maverick. You got a visitor. Well, I may decide to stay. Most jails, the waiter has his thumb in the soup and needs a shave. Well, thanks. I'm gonna need that. I'll wait for the tray. I won't have to come back. Sure. Yell when you're ready. You won't believe this, but suddenly I'm not hungry. I'm sorry about the food. The town council doesn't believe in coddling prisoners. Looks like I'll have to get used to it. Sheriff tells me I'll be here a while. You picked the wrong town to try a con game. Well, when I see a man like Moose Horton, something just comes over me. They're trying to figure whether you were cheating in the poker game too. - What do you think? - I don't know. I've seen men shot for cheating at poker. - In Bent Forks? - No. - Not in Bent Forks. - Kansas City? Your coffee is getting cold. By the way... I don't cheat at cards. I don't have to. There's no one easier to beat than a card sharp, if you know his twists. And in most games, there's usually one. Evening, Molly. Didn't expect to see you here. I brought Mr. Maverick his supper. - Thought that was Jamie's job. - He wasn't around. I'm waiting for the tray. I'll see that it gets back. - Goodbye, Mr. Maverick. - Bye, Molly. Thanks. Now, what's a pretty girl like that doing in Bent Forks? What's a drifter like you wanna know for? Here's your man, Mike. Well, want the job? Didn't Wes tell you anything about it? All he said was you wanted to see me. Closed mouth man, the sheriff. You said bring him and I brought him. As long as you're standing good for his bail, I'm satisfied. When the cattle drives hit town, I got a lot of games going here. There's always a few card slicks follow the herds. I need a spotter. Somebody knows how to keep the games honest. Way Molly tells it, you know all the ways cheating is done. I think she meant it as a compliment. Till the drives start, the job pays room, board and pocket money. After that, $12 a week. What do you say? Mike, all you got is his word he's an expert. Let me have a deck of cards. Are these marked? No. What's an advantage pin? It's a ring used by amateurs to mark cards during a game. I'm on my way to the bank, Mike. - All right, but hurry back. Molly, you look right pretty this morning. You needn't sound so surprised. Good morning, Mr. Maverick. Good morning. - Did you take the job? - He took it. Good. Why, I've seen some stupid mistakes in my day... but this beats them all. You're too old for your job. And you should have caught the mistake. You think I'm keeping you around here just because you're my nephew? Will you excuse me, gentlemen? Morning, Molly. - Certainly is a scorcher today. - I'm afraid so, Mr. Nelson. Yes, Ralph will be right with you. Uh, Ralph, will you help Miss Gleason, please? Thank you. - Morning. - I'll talk to you later. - Looks like another hot day. - Certainly does. I found him. - You sure? - He's perfect in every way. Meet at the shack, 9 tonight. There you are, Miss Gleason. Thank you. Good evening, Miss Gleason. I've been looking for a chance to thank you all day. If it made any sense, I'd say you'd been avoiding me. - Oh, why would I wanna do that? - I don't know. I don't know why you got me out of jail either. Does there have to be reason, Mr. Maverick? Well, there usually is. And I'd be just as grateful either way. I hated to think of a man with your appetite... having to eat jail food for a month. All right. I can apologize while I walk you home. I'm not going home. I promised Mrs. Davis I'd visit her tonight. She's the town invalid. Like me to come along? She hates the sight of a man. Unless he's a doctor. - Am I being avoided again? - You never were. - Can you wait till tomorrow? - Just barely. Good night, Miss Gleason. Well, now, why did you do that? Does there have to be a reason, Miss Gleason? - You're late. - I know. I kept running into people who wanted to talk. Who is he? His name is Maverick. - Is he a drifter? - Yes, I suppose he is. That makes it perfect. He's so near your size and build, no one could ever tell the difference. His hair is like yours too. Of course, he doesn't look anything like you. You know that doesn't matter. Hey. This is a time to smile. What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing, Ralph. I just wanna get it over with as soon as possible. I know you do, darling. But we can't rush things. Be another 10 days before all the cattle buyers are here. By that time, there will be over $100,000 in that safe. You'll need every second of that time. You've gotta work on him, Molly. You gotta get him where he'll do exactly what you want when you want it. That won't be easy, Ralph. He's no wide-eyed farm boy. These are big stakes, Molly. We both have to do things we'd rather not. Just keep thinking of the plans we've made. What about his hands? I think it will fit. Find out as soon as you can. But whatever you do, don't get into wondering. I'll manage. I was beginning to worry we'd never bring this off. But here it is. And it's gonna work. It's late. Shouldn't we be getting back? It's not that late. I call. Me too. - How's three jacks? - Beats me. I mean, look at those jacks. Good enough. I'd like a word with you and your friend. A word? About what? - If the two of you'll just step... - Beat it. Leave it there. Look, I won that pot and I intend to collect it. What's going on here? These two have been working the spread, sheriff. The spread? He had two jacks in a four-card hand. His partner held the third jack. When he spread his hand, he added it. They've been spreading all the time or just once? Come to think of it, they've been doing it right along. One would throw his hand, the other would say: "Show your whole hand, mister," then he'd reach over and spread it out. I had a notion about you boys when you rode in. Well, you got a choice. Jail or $100 bail for each of you. Here's the other gun, Wes. You let me know how much they won. You'll get it back. Well, come on. Let's go. Well, here we are. The only cool spot around, if you can call this cool. I thought you said it was only three miles out of town. The hotter the day, the farther out they move it. How long you been around here, Molly? Oh, about six months. Chicago? St. Louis. Why? Why? Usually, it's the other way around. Girl can't wait to leave the small town for the big city. Then she finds out what people think of a girl who has to work for a living. I got tired of having to prove they were wrong. So you picked the hottest, dustiest... most forsaken little town west of the Missouri? Bent Forks isn't such a bad little town. - What're you smiling about? - You, I like you. Even though you do think I'm a short horn. Molly, Bent Forks is a terrible little town. And if I ever saw a girl who can take care of herself in the big city, it's you. Well, thank you, sir. So? So all I'm trying to say is... your leaving the big town doesn't make sense. Molly, I am someone you can be honest with, talk to... get help from if you can use it. - You think I had to leave St. Louis? - I don't know. I don't wanna know. But you helped me. I'd like to return the favor if I can. Fact is, I insist on it. You're very nice. Do you realize I don't even know your first name? Changing the subject? All right, it's changed. Well, what is your name? - Bret. - Bret. I like that. Well, Bret... whatever made you become a...? - Drifter? - Heh. Drifter. Well, it's a long story. I keep on the move because I'm looking for a man. Sometimes, I'm afraid I might find him. Have to settle down. Do you wanna tell me about it? Someday. Not now. Aren't you hurrying things a little? Uh, I suppose that comes from not staying long enough in one place. Don't worry about it. Lady, I never worry about anything. Come in and shut the door. I thought you boys left town. Give him a hand with his gun. Drop the belt. You cost us an awful lot money, mister. Plus $200 we had to pay off in bail. And just what do you figure we ought to do about it? - You're holding the gun. - That counts a lot. Fred, check the hall. Now, move out of here and stay close to Fred. We're taking the back stairs. Looks about right here. Pile off. Tie him up. Up the hill. Turn around. I don't think I'll need this. As long as I aim to teach you a lesson, you ought to stay alive to remember it. All right. Go ahead. Now, hold it a minute. The way it looks... if you end up on your back, your partner pulls the trigger on me. You ain't gonna put me on my back, mister. Not you or five like you. Proving that's not gonna do either one of us any good. Now, you boys say I cost you a lot of money. All right, maybe I did. But I can show you how you can get it all back. And a lot more to keep it company. Interested? I'm not hanging around in a hole like Bent Forks for the climate. I found a real good thing. Only I need help. Someone who isn't afraid to take a chance or two. Taking chances is our business. What about it? You ain't said nothing yet. Well, that comes now. Come here. You know where the general store is? - Across the street from the hotel? - That's right. That's right here. Now, you go down the street about 50 yards... Hold it. Drop it. This is a private fight, sheriff. Yeah. Drop the gun belts. I ought to lock you up. Except for the expense of feeding you. All right, get on your horses and dust... and stay out of Bent Forks. For good. - Well, sheriff, all I can say is... - Save it for Molly. She saw the three of you ride off from her hotel window. As a matter of fact, I've been meaning to have a private talk with you myself. Their kind of talk? Well, that depends on you. It's about Molly. Stay away from her. Why? Well, for two reasons. I'm telling you to... and she's not your kind. Just what is my kind? Well, I won't go into that. But I'll put it this way, the next time I hear that you're around her... I'll pound you lopsided. Well, I'm real sorry to hear that, sheriff. Because I'm planning to see her tomorrow. What's the matter with you, sheriff? Couldn't you wait? I went after Wes and told him. I don't know whether he found them or not. Nothing we can do but wait and see. - Did you try the ring on him? - No. I didn't have a chance. There you are. Thank you. I still plan to see Molly. We gonna have to go through this thing again? Well... not until I've given it some more thought. It's unlocked. Morning. Thought you'd be at the cafe. Mike says you paid him back the money he loaned you. I got lucky last night. - And he says you're leaving town. - That's right. Without even saying goodbye to me? I thought I'd save that for last. Why are you leaving? Don't I mean anything to you at all? Molly, trying to understand you is like... Well, look, we don't even know each other. You're no starry-eyed girl. So you don't care if I really move on. Maybe I don't but... Can't you let me find that out from myself? You know, if it weren't for me, you'd still be in jail. Please stay, just for few days. Help me to be as sure about us as you are. Now, how do I do that? By staying. I had something all planed for us today, you would've enjoyed it. What was it? - Will you come with me? - Where? Well, it's a little place... I don't think I'll tell you. Will you come? I've got too much curiosity not to and you know it. Ho! Well, there it is. - What do you think of it? - I am very impressed. Three-hundred acres of the best farmland around here go with it. You're not trying to sell me a farm? Well, you said you'd have to settle down someday. Why not here? In Texas, you can look farther but you can't see as much. Come on. Well, I gotta admit... place is just beautiful. But I still... don't wanna buy a farm. Who asked you to? - Close your eyes. - What? Go ahead. Close your eyes. - What was that all about? - Just wanted to see if it fits. It does. No, Molly, it doesn't. Not really. Doesn't it? I think I'd like to go back now. What is it, Molly? What's it about? Just when I think I've got you all figured out, you fool me... you do something unexpected. I just suddenly realized I haven't any right to try and change you. If we start back now... you can leave today the way you planned. I'm sorry, Molly. I don't know if it's that kiss... or because you're suddenly a puzzle I can't walk away from... but I'm staying a while longer. I'll solve your puzzle for you. I didn't want you to leave until I was ready to let you go, that's all. Just woman's vanity. Thanks, but I think I'll stay anyhow. - Good evening, Miss Gleason. - Good evening, Mr. Jordan. Could I trouble you for some cigars? Uh, three of those. The shack, 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. - Thank you. - Thank you. We're through waiting, Molly. We're ready to move. - When? - Now. Tonight. Tonight? Are you sure we...? What's wrong with you? Nothing. I just wasn't expecting it. I don't know if I'm ready. Have you gone soft on that saddle strap, is that what's happened? No! I just need more time to think. We've had too much time to think. Molly, you're not gonna let us down, not now. Not when everything's right in our hands. Oh, Molly. Molly, we can't quarrel now. Remember St. Louis? When we sat through that rainy night making plans? The plans are real now and they're ours. All we have to do is take them. There's $100,000 in that safe. You still want it, don't you? Yes. Yes, I do. Now more than ever. But does it have to be the way we planned? - Why can't we just take that money and go? - Because I told you we can't. We'd be running the rest of our lives. We'd have nothing. I won't be hunted. They've got to think I'm dead. It's the way it's got to be. It's up to you, Molly. You want what we planned or you wanna go back to where I found you? All right, Ralph. I'll do whatever you say. Now you'll have everything you dreamed of. No worries, no regrets. I'll be here with the money at 10:00 tonight. You better give me an hour's leeway. You and Maverick should leave town about 10:30. Are you sure you can get him here? That he won't balk at coming to the shack that late? Yes, I'm sure. - No questions? - No. Not anymore. Then we better get back. Remember, it's got to be Maverick who opens this door. You stay back into one side. I'll remember, Ralph. Make sure you do, because the second that door opens... whoever is standing there gets a blast in the face. - I know! I know! - Molly! Molly. Come on, Maverick. About time you had a drink. On me. No, thanks, Mike. What's the matter? You got something on your mind? Maybe. There it is. It's just the kind of a night I promised you. There's a full moon, there's even a little breeze. Anywhere special you'd like to go? Well, I don't know. That little shack you showed me? All right, if you'd like to. Will your friend, Jordan, be there? I saw you out there with him today, so don't try to feign an answer, Molly. You wanna talk to me, make it the truth. You'd never believe me. I was gonna tell you everything on the way out there. But you'd never believe that, it's too late now. You can't run away from this. What's it about? Where do I fit in? Tell me the truth and I'll believe you all the way. Please let me go. I can't tell you. Not now. Yes, you can, and you will. If it's so bad you can't talk about it, it only leaves one answer: He was going to kill me. Why? I was going to tell you on the way there. All right. Why would he or you want me dead? Do you believe me that I was going to tell you? Yeah. Yeah, sure. He's out there now, just waiting... with $100,000 he took from the bank tonight. All right. Why did he need me? He was afraid of being hunted and caught. He is waiting for you with a shotgun. You'd be found in a day or so wearing his clothes, his ring... with your face all blown off. That's so simple, it should have worked. - And you were gonna tell me about it? - Yes. - Why should you? - Maybe because I... I guess I always knew I couldn't help him kill anyone. And maybe because I... I found out yesterday... that I'm in love with you. Then you would have told me yesterday. I waited because I wanted the money too. All we have to do is go and get it. - Kill Jordan instead of me? - No, we'll surprise him. Just tie him up and leave him there to be found. No, no. Jordan's right. For that kind of money, they wouldn't stop till they found you. We won't run and we won't hide. We'll stay right here. And when we get ready to leave, they won't even ask us where we're going. Don't you understand? He can't tell them anything. Not without giving himself away. He'll even have to protect us by blaming it on someone else. Someone who doesn't even exist. You're quite a girl, Molly. You really are. I won't need any help. You can wait for me here. I can't let you go by yourself. I got to go with you. Why? I'd be pretty stupid to run away with it, wouldn't I? I'm surprised at you, Molly. Didn't anyone ever tell you: When you love a man, you gotta trust him. You're watching the wrong hole. Put it down. You and your girlfriend are all through. You and I are going back into town with that money. Now, move away from it. Hang on, Jordan. I'll get you a doctor, quick. Did she...? Did she tell you? Don't try to talk. If you die, I could be in a lot of trouble. That... That's too bad. - Is everything all right? - No. Jordan's dead. How? What happened? He had a gun under his coat and he used it. That doesn't change anything. We're still safe, we can hide the money. There isn't any money. He didn't have it with him. You're lying. He wouldn't go there without it. He could have decided to kill me, then get the money. No! We worked out every minute of this, every move. - Bret, what are you trying...? - Have you heard enough, Wes? I guess you'll have to come with me. I'm sorry. I tried to talk myself into leaving you out of it... but I couldn't make it come out right. Molly. It's a terrible... Terrible shock to me, gentlemen. Not only a trusted employee, but my own nephew. - I can't begin to... - We're not concerned with that. We put our money in this bank to buy cattle with. - Please... - Herds will be coming in today. We want that cattle. How are we supposed to pay? - Please, I'm trying to explain... - We want money, not explanations. You get some cash in this bank and get it quick. You said the thief didn't get away. What did he do with it? He hid it somewhere between here and where he was killed. We've got men out looking. Then offer a reward. Do something besides talk. I intend to. Yes, indeed. The printer will be here any minute. I'm having posters printed offering $1000 reward... for the return of the money. A thousand dollars? Hardly seems like enough, Mr. Nelson. The way I hear it, 100,000 is missing. He's right. You won't get any action for a piddling $1000. Put up some real money and you'll have the whole town out hunting for it. All right. All right. I'll make it, uh, $2000. Isn't 5 percent the usual reward? Five thousand ought to get some quick action. Five? Five... I wouldn't consider it. I'm having posters printed offering $2000 reward. I'd say 3000, Mr. Nelson. But the bank can't afford it. The devil with the bank. It's our money and we want it here. All right. Three thousand dollars. Does that make it official, sheriff? Yeah, that makes it official. You won't need those posters. Your friend took a shot at me... when I tried to get this back for you, Mr. Nelson. You, uh, could have been more generous. Generous? Why, this is a barefaced swindle. This bank won't pay you one cent. You've already done it. It's all there, Mr. Nelson, except the reward, of course. I took that out in advance, exactly $3000. - But... - Maverick. You've got 10 minutes to get out of this town. Sheriff, I've got out of towns this size in five minutes. - Good morning, Mr. Maverick. - Good morning, Chris. - Could I talk to your prisoner? - Sure, if you wanna risk it. Could I borrow this? Hey, was that a $1000 bill? It was. Hello, Molly. What do you want? I was leaving Bent Forks. I wanted to say goodbye. Bye. Come here, Molly. Please. Mr. Nelson parted with a small reward. Here, take it, Molly. Between you, a good lawyer and a jury of cowhands, you won't be away too long. Here, take it. When it's over, there'll be enough of that left for you to make a fresh start. Maybe by then, you'll realize... that the best chance you'll ever have is right here in Bent Forks. I think you know his name. Goodbye. Bye, Bret.
