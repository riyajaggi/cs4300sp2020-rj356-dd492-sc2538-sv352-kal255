 Maverick (1957â€“1962): Season 1, Episode 7 - Relic of Fort Tejon - full transcript 
 Bret wins a "full-blooded Arabian mount" in a poker game, but soon discovers he's been conned - the Arabian mount turns out to be an overly-affectionate camel. While fleeing the dromedary, Bret stumbled into a small town and runs into an old flame who's engaged to the town's mayor. Bret soon learns that the mayor runs a crooked gambling hall and isn't above shooting card players when they stumble onto his cheating ways.

 You got the wrong man, friend. Oh, I got the right man. Low-down, dirty, double-dealing rat I've been looking for. We got a score to settle. - You looking for a gunfight, friend? - That's the only kind that settles things. Now you start for your gun. Well, that won't be necessary. You see, I've got a derringer in this hat. And it's pointed straight for your heart. That's a pretty tired bluff, Maverick. Call it, friend.

Because it was here that I first met Fatima. My raise, Mr. Brimmer. Your open and a hundred better. I'm tapped out, Maverick. I'd like to make you a business proposition. I'll give you the chance to buy a full-blooded Arabian mount... for $200. - Imported Arabian? - Absolutely. If he is, it ought to be a bargain. It's a she. And I'll stand behind every word.

 You got yourself a deal. She cost me a hundred. I'll just meet the raise. - How many cards? - I'm pat. You're pat? One card to the dealer. I'll check to the pat hand. A hundred even. Let's keep it neat. You're good, Maverick. No sense throwing good money after bad. Cash me in, will you? What were you holding? Uh, you didn't pay to find out. Game is over. I kind of like to know what you beat me with. - Sometimes it's better not to know. - What did you have? Why you got nothing. You ran one. I should have known better. - You double-crossing, no... - Easy, Brimmer. If you're gonna play poker you have to develop a sense of humor. That's the whole trick, my friend. Keep smiling. Keep smiling, huh? I'll remember that the next time I get in a game with you. Not very likely, or I wouldn't have shown you those cards. See, I'm leaving Clayville tomorrow. And, uh, I better take a look of that Arabian of mine. Hmm, that's right. She's your Arabian now, isn't she? Well, what's that for? Oh, first impressions are always important. With both animals and humans. - Well, there she is. - Where? Your Arabian beauty. With the long neck and the sad eyes. There she is. She's like I said, full-blooded Arabian mount. Mm-hm. Imported. Of course, uh, she ain't very pretty, but she's, uh, kind of a relic. I think she's probably one of the last the Army brought over. Never mind the history lesson. The fact is you took me. Might just as well have stolen $200 out of my pocket. Mr. Maverick. Yes, I know. Keep smiling. Oh. You may be making yourself a friend for life. Oh, that's gonna be a short life. I'm leaving town tomorrow. And you can keep your Arabian mount. And forget about the $200. - I don't want her. - Well, that makes two of us. The difference is now she belongs to you. Good luck, Maverick. Keep smiling, huh? Goodbye, Fatima. Hey, don't bring that clown in here. We've got no room. Besides, we only cater to four-legged animals... with straight backs. Hush, friend. She might hear you. Where she comes from, they treat her like a queen. Just take her back where she come from because I don't want her in here. Oh, don't you pay any attention to him, Fatima. Bret Maverick never let a lady down before and he's not gonna start now. I may be leaving tomorrow, but tonight, you're gonna have a bath. Some cologne, fine bran... and a nice comfortable stall. She has got pretty eyes, hasn't she? Beautiful. Come on. The following day I made a heart-rending discovery. Trying to sell a camel... was like trying to sell a herd of sheep to a cattle man. Three nights later, I was halfway to Silver Springs... and Fatima was still on my hands. I'd learned by now that you not only couldn't sell a camel... you couldn't give one away. But what was even more frightening... Fatima had fallen in love with me. Well, take her and forget about the money. You don't owe me a cent. - No. - You drive a hard bargain, Mr. Johnson. Look, all I wanna do is see she gets a nice home. Now, suppose I give her to you and pay you $25. No. Fifty? No. A hundred dollars. That's my last offer. What do you say? Yep. That's a deal you'll never regret. Well, so long, little girl. It's been nice knowing you. Now you behave yourself. Mr. Johnson will take good care of you. Goodbye, Fatima. Need some help, miss? - I'm awful handy to have around. - Now just a... - Bret. - In person. - What are you doing in Silver Springs? - Trying to rekindle an old friendship. - Bret, it is good to see you. - Now, that's better. - How long have you been here? - Oh, about five minutes. - How long you been here? - Almost a year. - Married? - Not yet. - But soon. - Congratulations. A man that, uh, lucky in love ought to be a cinch in a poker game. - I'd like to meet him. - Unless you've change, you will. He runs the Square Deal Saloon. He's name is Carl Jimson. The citizens of Silver Springs elected him mayor. They all love him. Me too. Here, I'll take these. - Will you be around here for a while? - Oh, a little while. Business? - Just rambling. - Oh. Bret, I know you better than that. You never go anywhere without a reason. Well, maybe you're right. But it's not a very important reason. Say, I'm gonna need a hotel room, can you give me any recommendations? Oh, the Silver Springs Hotel right back there. Ask for Howard Harris. You'll be coming to the Square Deal later? Will you be there? Mm-hm. - I want you to meet Carl. - Then I'll be there. What's the matter, Bret? Can't you find a game to your taste? - I just thought I'd watch a while. - You never used to be so patient. - Wait a minute, Tommy. - Simmer down. Simmer down. Come on now. We've been friends too long... - to have any trouble around here. - I've got no beef with you. It's Scott. My lucky boy untapped me. All of a sudden my credit is no good anymore. You know the house rules. We don't tell the players what to do. Why don't you pack in for the night, huh? I'm cleaned out, Carl. How do I tell my wife? - How much money you lose? - Two hundred. Tommy, here's $50. That will get you off the hook with your wife. - You don't have to do this. - I know I don't, but I want to. Now you go on home. Don't let me catch you back here... - trying to win back this money. - Thanks. Tomorrow's another night. We're gonna be here. Carl. I want you to meet Bret Maverick. Mr. Maverick, Carl. This is Carl Jimson. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Maverick. - Mr. Jimson. Welcome to the Square Deal. Can't promise a win, but we can guarantee a fair shake. - A man can't ask for any more than that. - That's right. - You and Donna here old friends? - Oh, we met in Clovis. Oh, Carl. Excuse me a minute, Mr. Maverick. Make yourself at home. Nice meeting you. - Like him? - Oh, he seems like a real likeable gent. I knew you'd feel that way. Uh, you sure he's the one? Positive. Does Mr. Jimson play much? When the stakes are high enough. I've been watching the players. Are they regulars? A couple of regulars. A few of them do pretty well. - You mean they win pretty steady. - Mm-hm. Which ones? Oh, let me tell you. The one in the red shirt. One, uh, in the brown coat and the gray hat. How did you know? Oh, they just do a lot of ear pulling, eye twitching between them. - You think they're cheating? - Maybe they're just nervous. Carl wouldn't stand for any cheating. That's what everybody tells me. Where are you going? I'm gonna play some poker. - I thought you said the game was crooked. - I did. - But it's the only one in town. - Now, wait, Bret. You think Connors and Ferguson are up to something, I'll tell Carl. Oh, I wouldn't do that, Donna. After all, I'm just guessing. Your bet, Maverick. Five hundred even. Beats me. Well, how about it? You call? What's the rush? You're slowing up the action. Tough. Come on, call or drop. There's a lot of money in that pot. Look, my money's in there too. I'm taking my time. You in a hurry, Maverick? It's a good-sized call. Take all the time you need. Here's your 500. And another 250. You seem mighty anxious to make that raise. You must have quite a hand. You're invited to take a look, friend. Just a call, Mr. Connors. - Three queens. - Oh, let's see that, friend. Sorry, friend. They're doesn't seem to be a full hand here. You called three queens. There's only two here. I'm sorry, I thought I had them. I must be getting bleary-eyed or something. Sure, it can happen. But that makes my three 10s good. Hey, Connors, you better get yourself a pair of specs. All right, all right. I'm sorry. Deal me out. Me and Ferguson was running a four-card spread on this stranger Maverick. He was in there like a bird-dog before Ferguson could plant a queen... - in my hand. - Ha, ha. What, you boys losing your touch? He's a pro, Carl. I'll be willing to bet on it. Yeah? How much is he in to us for? - Oh. Over a thousand. - Yeah? Mr. Maverick is looking for trouble, he's gonna get it. I'll tell you what you do. You go back down in that game. Use Ferguson. Use your heads, both of you. - Let me know if anything happens. - Right. Kings full. Enough room for them chips? Oh, I can always make big ones out of the little ones. - Hey, you're doing fine. - I always enjoy a wide open game. There's no question about it, boss. He's a pro. - Ask Ferguson. - I was using a single card holdout. Maverick just riffled the deck and called for a count. One card missing, and he knew it. - Did you get the card back in the deck? - Boss, please. When I counted the cards, it was exactly 52. Ah, what's the difference? He knows we're running a brace joint. - He's on to every twist. - He's ahead about 5000 now, Carl. We better make our move. Maybe the smartest thing to do is play straight while he's here. If we stop playing into his hand, maybe he'll move on. Let him move on with $5000 of my money? Might be worth it. After all, Carl, you got a good thing going here. Why take chances? Hmm. When he stops winning, he'll start talking, huh? You ever think of that? I got a good thing here, Connors, because I don't take chances. I'll handle this thing myself. Jimson hadn't been in the game... 10 minutes before I knew why he was there. He was the real expert. Making his two brace men look like a pair of amateurs. He was there to get his money back. And he had already slipped a couple of smooth tricks right past me. But I had him spotted now. And he had all the money back he was going to get. Up to you, mister. I'll raise right back. I'll match that. How many, please? If you don't mind, I'd like a cut. Well, now, Mr. Maverick. Cards were cut before the deal. How many, please? According to Mr. Hoyle's book of rules... a player is entitled to a cut at any time during the game. Hoyle don't make the rules here, friend, I do. How many, please? I'm sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you were playing a poker game. You can make up rules for any game you like... but don't call it poker, it's misleading. Now, you had your say, Mr. Maverick, how many cards do you want? I figure if a man doesn't wanna give me a cut... he knows something about the deck that I don't know. You calling me a cheat? Just calling for a cut. Now, look here, nobody calls Carl Jimson a crook. That's what everybody says. If you're looking for trouble, you're gonna find it. Whether gun trouble or card trouble, you're gonna get it. I'm not looking for trouble. You just let me cut those cards and everything will be all right. Tinhorn got nervous about a big hand, and called me cheat. Went for his gun. Get the doctor. I saw him try to draw on you. Lucky you drew faster, he'd have had you sure. Will somebody get the doctor? He may still be alive. Ah, trigger-happy guys are all alike. Get him out. - Where will we take him? - I don't care, get him out. Bring him in, but very easy, boys. You need to be very easy. Very easy. - Careful, gentleman, that's a new rug. - Where's his room? Wouldn't it be better if you took him to your place? Which room? - Doctor, it's Room 8. - Yeah. Go on. Who's there? DONNA: Donna. - Hello, Bret, how are you feeling? - Oh, I'm all right. I brought you some fresh coffee. Oh, that's very considerate of you, Donna. But does Honest Carl Jimson know that you're on this errand of mercy? No. I can't stay. Well, thanks for the coffee, anyway. Bret, everyone in town says that you're just waiting... till you get back on your feet so you can go and finish your gunfight... - with Carl. - Well, I kind of let that word get around. Don't do it. The man ripped a hole in my shoulder. That's hard to forget. You made the first move. Everyone knows that. Donna, I know how you feel about Jimson. I'm sorry. But I heard about him from a friend of mine. That's why I came here. The one way for a card player to be sure of winning... is to get into a crooked game and play honest. If he knows what to look for. There's nothing I like better than to trip up a card shark. Carl is not what you say. - You're wrong about him. - Not this time. But he knows you're coming. He'll have to defend himself. I want him to know it. I want him to spend some time thinking about it. What good will it do? One of you will have to lose. That's usually the way it works. Bret, I'm in love with him. Will you leave town without trying to see him again? Will you do it for me? I'm sorry, Donna, I can't do that. Hello, Carl. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Something is wrong. What is it? What were you doing in Maverick's room today? I know you were there. Why? - I took him some coffee. - Why? I went there to try and talk him out of this stupid gunfight. Who is he, Donna? What does he mean to you? I wanna know. I thought I was in love with him once. It was a long time ago. It's all over. Does it make any difference, Carl? With us, I mean. No. Why should it, honey? You're my girl now, ain't you? Donna, I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing. - Just the thought of you and another man. - It's all right, Carl. I wish you'd go now. I'm sorry, Donna. I swear it will never happen again. - Who is it? HOWARD: It's me, Mr. Maverick. - Howard. - I just want to find out... - how long you intended to stay. - Well, that depends. The doctor figures a few more weeks. I figure a few more days. A number of the citizens have been discussing your intention... of challenging Mr. Jimson. When you're up and around, that is. - That's my intention. - Do you think that's wise, Mr. Maverick? Well, it's more necessary than wise, Howard. Well, it certainly doesn't seem like good strategy to me to announce your intention. Well, it is, the way I figure Mr. Jimson. You see, I'm pretty certain that under that manly chest of his... beats a heart of pure yellow. I want him to know I'm coming. And think about it for a long time. And suppose he doesn't wait? Suppose he comes to visit you? Honest Carl Jimson? Why, he wouldn't dream of attacking a sick man. After all, he has quite a reputation in this town. You seem to have it all figured out, Mr. Maverick. Ahem. Well, in any case, I wonder if you'd like to give me a little something... against your bill. Well, you've been doing some figuring too, haven't you, Howard? Hmm, I just like to keep accounts current. How much do I owe you? Let's see now, there's... Well, old girl, you must have had quite a trip. Who gave you my address, huh? - You know that beast, uh, Mr. Maverick? - Oh, yes. We spent several beautiful nights together. Fatima, what am I gonna do with you? She can't stay in the room with you. This hotel has rules. Oh, yes, no lady camels allowed. Say, isn't Silver Springs pretty close to the desert? The Henderson's Well is just 10 miles outside of town. And that's the last stop before miles and miles of desert. Well, someone in this town ought to be interested in buying a camel. Hmm, I doubt it. Say, Howard, would you try to sell her for me? I'm a busy man, Mr. Maverick. I'm supposed to be running a hotel. I realize that your time is valuable... so here's a little something for, uh, handling the transaction. Just make sure she gets a nice home. How am I gonna get her out? Well, you could try pulling from the other side. Well, I'll do my best. Oh, Howard, I've had a little, uh, experience with this. If you can't sell Fatima, try bribing some softhearted farmer. You can go as high as $50. And just make sure they treat her kindly. You know, she used to be a queen. Connors. Yeah? This gent wants to see Mr. Jimson. - Well, what's your name, stranger? - Drake. Mr. Jimson is expecting me. Oh. You wait here. I'll go see what he has to say. Come in. A fellow named Drake downstairs. Says you're expecting him. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he's interested in some property out toward Rigby. Send him up. Kind of dude-looking. - Sure he's all right? - I said to send him up. Come in. Oh, Mr. Drake. Carl Jimson. You come to me highly recommended. I'm in need of a good specialist right now. - Hey, how about a smoke? - No, thank you. Hmm? Look here. There's a tinhorn named Maverick, come into town here and tried to bust me up. - I had to gun him. - They tell me you did a careless job. Well, they tell you right, son. He's going to be back on his feet soon, and he's gonna come after me. - Sounds like where I come in. - Exactly where you come in. Right between me and Mr. Maverick. I got a lot of money now. I can afford not to take unnecessary risks. You understand? With me, there's no risk, Mr. Jimson. Yeah? Nobody must know that you're fighting for me. This Maverick is no saddle tramp. They say he's fast in a card game, he may be fast on the draw too. I'm faster. You sure you can handle...? - Does that convince you? - It sure does. Now, look here. Here's part of your money. You get the rest when you take care of Maverick. Now, this must look like a fight between you and Maverick. Nobody must know you're fronting for me. Oh, uh, Mr. Maverick. Mr. Maverick, wait. - You're going to see Mr. Jimson? - That's right. Well, uh, about your bill, Mr. Maverick. Would you, uh, mind paying up before you go? - I'll be back. - Uh, I know, Mr. Maverick... but, uh, you see, we really can't be sure of that. Maverick? You talking to me? Don't you remember me? Can't say I do. Maybe you got a reason to forget? You got the wrong man, friend. Oh, I got the right man. Low-down, dirty, double-dealing rat I've been looking for. We got a score to settle. I'll say it once more and I'll say it slow. I don't know you. If you'll get out of my way I've got some business to settle inside. I've waited a long time to meet up with you again. You've got some business to settle out here first. Oh, I begin to get the idea. The two things are tied up together. Are you gonna talk or are you gonna settle? You looking for a gunfight, friend? Well, that's the only kind that settles things. You seem pretty sure of yourself. That puts me in a spot. You see, I'm not the fastest gun in the world. - I am. - I figured that's why Jimson hired you. Who's Jimson? I just told you. Fine. Now you start for your gun. Oh, that won't be necessary. You see, I've got a derringer in this hat. And it's pointed straight for your heart. A little trick I learned from your friend Jimson. Don't try. That's a pretty tired bluff, Maverick. Call it, friend. All right. Drop the hat. I'd like to see this derringer. I'll show it to you right after I pull the trigger. Now, you've got about five seconds to drop that gun. Leave the gun in the holster and drop the gun belt. The time is up. Throw it over there. The way I figured, killing is a serious matter. And a man who keeps smiling when he's gunning somebody... he's not a man at all. You should have called me, friend. You had the best hand. Jimson? Bret! Go away! There's been enough shooting. It isn't gonna help anyone! Sorry, Donna, I've gotta play this hand out. Maverick! Will you hold your fire to let the lady by? Be glad to. Send her out. No, I won't! I'm not gonna make it any easier for you fools to kill each other. Is she coming? One second, Maverick! Okay, Donna. Go on outside and talk to him. Maybe you can get him to change his mind. Go on. All right. She's coming out, Maverick! Go on. He shot her. He shot her in cold blood. I seen it! Somebody get the doc! Give me a hand here. He said he'd hold his fire to let Donna by. When she came towards him, he shot her down. - Agree that's the way it happened? - Jimson shot her. Would I shot the girl I love? The girl I'm gonna marry? Fired at me while I was waiting to let her go by. He missed and fired again. That shot was the one that got her. According to him she was shot in the back. That where the wound was, doctor? No. All the bullet was in her chest. When he fired the first shot, she turned around. The second was the one that got her in the chest. You never run short of answers, do you? What are her chances, doc? It's hard to say. She's lost a lot of blood. I can't even try to remove the bullet yet. She said anything about who did it? Hmm, she's still unconscious. It doesn't look too good. And it doesn't look too good for me either. I use a .45, sheriff. You might ask Jimson what kind he uses. - Well, Carl? - I use a .45 too, sheriff. Try again, tinhorn. You're a smooth talker, Maverick. But I'm holding you under arrest. If the girl dies, you'll be charged with murder. Then you guard her real good. She's the only one that can tell you which of us fired that shot. And I wouldn't want anything to happen to her while I'm in jail. Lou. Maverick. You got company. When you want out, just holler. Um... Not you, him. I've never been in a jail before. Ha, ha. You spend a lot of time in that hotel of yours. Ah, you're a jokester, Mr. Maverick, but I certainly like your spirit. - I just dropped by to deliver your change. - My change? Oh, I've got a wonderful home for Fatima in the outskirts of town. - And the man took her for only $35. - Well, thank you, Howard. Um, have you heard anything about Miss Seely? They say she's just about the same, still unconscious and all. The doctor's about given up hope. Look, I know how you feel about Mr. Jimson... - but he's awful broken up about it. - Oh, I bet. He thinks maybe the doc hasn't done all he could do for her, so, uh... I know he went Crown City. There's another doctor over there. - Supposed to be pretty good. - He left? Yeah. He's gonna bring the doctor back here. - When did he leave? - Oh, well, a couple of hours ago, I think. Why? What are you getting so excited about? He told Doc Nelson all about it. He said he didn't mind. Howard? - Have you seen Doc Nelson lately? - Me? What do I wanna see him for? Well, I first noticed it at the hotel. You don't look too good. You've got kind of a haze over your eyes. That's a sure sign. And your skin is all peaked and reddish. Ah. It's always like that. It's a lot worse than when I first saw you at the hotel. - It is? - Yeah. Do you ever get any pains in your head or anywhere? Uh, I feel very fit. Except once in a while, when I get up, I don't feel too chipper. Yeah, now, that's what I mean. You really ought to see the doc. Uh, you said you just wanted to deliver his change. I'd like to talk to Mr. Harris for a while. Is it all right? - Howard, is Jimson traveling alone? - Yeah, I think so. - Do you have a horse outside? - Yeah, sure. Looks like I'll have to borrow it. Mine is at the stable. Ha, ha. You know, some of your jokes are way over my head, Mr. Maverick. You're in jail. What would you be doing with a horse? I'd be trailing Honest Carl Jimson. And it's about time I got started. Now, Howard, I wouldn't do this to anyone but a true-blue friend. Deputy, come here. Quick. - What happened? - Well, he's sick. We were talking and he passed out. You better get a doc. I better get some water first. Just get him up. - I wonder what it is. - I don't know. Hyah! Jimson had started a rock slide to cover the well. And it had worked just fine. I had no water and Jimson had all he'd need. That made the odds a little too long. If how fast they were riding meant anything... that was a very angry posse. And suddenly those odds didn't seem long after all. The desert began to look like just the place for me to go. I couldn't be sure of getting far without water... but there was one thing I could be sure of. That posse wouldn't follow me into the desert. And then I had another happy thought. Jimson must have used cartridges to bring off that slide. Maybe he didn't have many left. Jimson had won another round. And this looked like the final one. The problem was real simple now. To get out of the desert alive, if I could. Fatima! You're even more beautiful than I thought. Now let's go after him. There are gambles that haven't right to pay off. This one had. Because of a lovely girl named Fatima who just couldn't take no for an answer. Jimson was still running, but now it was only a matter of time. Two hours later, Jimson's horse gave out, but he kept on running. When I got closer, he started firing. Fortunately, his marksmanship hadn't improved a bit. And when his shells were gone... Jimson gave up fighting and started talking. I had finally found someone who wanted to buy Fatima. The offer started at $5 000 and went up. It almost pained me to have to say no. That's thoughtful of you, Fatima. You're quite a woman. Up, Fatima. Up. Good girl. Sheriff! Down, Fatima. Down. - Good girl, Fatima. - Take him inside, boys. I never expected to see you back here, Maverick. Oh, I'm just full of surprises, sheriff. I didn't think Silver Springs would be the same without old Honest Carl. I go back to jail now? Well, you ought to if only for the way you got out. Donna is better. She told us who shot her. I think Jimson should be hung. I had no idea he did all that to poor Mr. Maverick. We don't have a hanging charge against him. If you can't hang him, you ought to sentence him to target practice. - He sure needs it. - Ha-ha-ha. I don't like people going around busting out of my jail, but I'm glad you did. - Can I see her now? - Doc says it's all right. She'll be like new in a few weeks. - Maverick? - Yeah. I wanna thank you. For myself and for the townspeople for bringing Jimson in. I know how much easier it would've been to left him there. Ah, well, don't thank me, sheriff. Credit belongs to Fatima. If the town plans to build a monument... make it a camel with a mangy coat and big sad eyes. I rode out of Silver Springs that afternoon. I was glad to be going. But I felt a sense of sadness and regret that I'd never see Fatima again. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
