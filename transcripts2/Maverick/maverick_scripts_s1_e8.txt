 Maverick (1957–1962): Season 1, Episode 8 - Hostage - full transcript 
 Intros brother Bart (Jack Kelly) teaming with Bret to board a riverboat's maiden voyage, sold out to Creole aristocrats with gambling fever. To crash the private cruise, the Mavericks intro themselves to the ship's French owner, whose lovely daughter Yvette is shanghaied right after the Mavericks are rebuffed. The brothers pursue the kidnappers, hoping to win the jeune fille, an invitation, and a reward. At the New Orleans cabaret where the Mavericks meet Yvette, pop singer Don Durant ("Johnny Ringo") croons "Get Along Home Cindy" to her. Durant was a runner-up for the role of Bart.

 We're walking out of here. You try anything and I'll touch this fuse. You're bluffing. Now, drop it out or I'll... You can pull that trigger, but I have time to light this fuse. You couldn't get away from it. He ain't bluffing, Jody. You can see it in his eyes. He ain't that willing to die. You're right. But I'd rather go this way than be shot by you. We'll all be buried together. I'm counting three. - Get her out of here. - Don't move. - One. - This ain't worth no thousand dollars.

 - I'm leaving here. - You're staying. Nobody leaves this place. We're all leaving. Two. I wanna get out too, Jody. If he touches that fuse we're all dead. Uh, pardon me, will you te...? Maybe you could ju... Say, maybe you can help me. Can you tell me how to get to number 17 rue "Robidux"? Here in New Orleans, we call it rue Robidoux. You take the first street to your left here... walk two blocks, turn right, and that's rue Robidoux. - Thanks kindly, friend. - Uh-huh. Hey! - Are you in trouble already? - What...?

 - Bret. Ha, ha! - Bart. You took your time getting... Hey! Uh, you better get in here before something else happens. - Hey, hey, Bret. - Took you long enough. Why, I left just as soon as I got your telegram. The cattle boat got hung up on a sandbar for four days north of Natchez. Thought I recognized the fine old cattle odor. There's hot water and a pitcher, go use it. - Did you bring any good suit? - Yeah. In my wool bag. Say, uh, what about this once-in-a-lifetime deal you dragged me down here on? You never learned how to take care of your clothes, did you? Never mind the clothes, what about the deal? That can wait. Now, we have to take on the impossible. Making you look like a gentleman. Your thousand dollar bills? Still pinned to your pocket? Think I would've worked my way downriver if I still had it? From the looks of this place, I'd say you parted with yours too. Now, that's better, isn't it? Hey, thanks a lot. So you are broke. Only for the moment, Bart. Only for the moment. Have you ever heard of the River Princess? A lady friend? She's a brand-new steam packet. A regular floating palace... with real crystal chandeliers and gold plated doorknobs. Now, tomorrow, she starts her maiden run to St. Louis. And the passengers on board will be the wealthiest in New Orleans. - The cream of Creole society. - You don't say. Ever heard about the Creole aristocrat? Oh, gambling fools, they tell me. And proud. So proud that they had bet the last ruffle... before they had let anyone think that money meant a rap to them. - Are you with me? - Ha-ha-ha. Been waiting for you to catch up. What do we use for a stake? First, we get a cabin suite on the River Princess. With what? Oh, no. Two tickets on the maiden voyage of the River Princess, please. There are no tickets for sale for the maiden run of the River Princess. - Standing room will be fine. - No one but no one will be aboard. Except the personal guests of Monsieur Henri Devereaux himself. - The invitations are already sent out. - Not ours. You know Monsieur Devereaux? We will. Where could we find him? I can assure you, it would be a waste of time for you gentlemen. - Would you like to...? - Could I interest...? Sir, are you a gambling man? On occasion. Well, good. We'll test your sporting blood. We'll bet you $500 even money... that we'd get one of those invitations from Mr. Devereaux. It is not often that I have the opportunity to bet on a sure thing, monsieur. It's a deal. Now all you have to do is tell us where we can find Mr. Devereaux. Monsieur Devereaux maintains a town suite at the Hotel Royale. And, uh, now, monsieur, uh, you spoke of 500... - I'll write a check. - No, no, brother Bart, I made the wager... I'll take the risk. Now, uh, what is your name, sir? George Rousseau. Mine is Bret Maverick. Messieurs. A table for two. Near Mr. Devereaux. Uh, Monsieur Devereaux? Now, Monsieur Devereaux is the gentleman at the next table... sitting with his charming daughter, Mademoiselle Yvette. And now may I suggest a bottle of sparkling muscatel... or some fine champagne, vintage '43...? Two coffees. - We're teetotalers... - Black. As you wish, monsieur. Oh, Inspector Marvin, those two gentlemen insisted on a table... next to Monsieur Devereaux. I thought you should know this. Oh? I'll keep an eye on them, Pierre, thanks. I wish I was an apple A-hanging on a tree And every time my Cindy passed She'd take a bite of me She told me that she loved me She called me sugar plum She threw her arms around me I knew my time had come Get along home, Cindy, Cindy Get along home Get along home, Cindy, Cindy I'll marry you someday Yvette. Jody is an entertainer, Papa. It is permissible to look at him. Only if you have an extraordinary bad taste. Because he cannot afford to wear a ruffled shirt? Because he has the grace of a man instead of a dancing master? - Yvette... - Or merely because he is an American? Isn't that enough? And also a musket hunter from the swamps. Times have changed, Papa. We cannot live behind our walls forever. Besides, we are Americans too. Never. Really? I think you still resent the fact... that you were not consulted about the Louisiana purchase. France may have seen fit to abandon us... but we Creoles are still New Orleans. And always will be. Get along home, Cindy, Cindy I'll marry you someday Now my Cindy's got religion - She got it... - Yvette, if you were not my daughter... - I would think that... - What, Father? But when she hears my old guitar... We prefer that you perform elsewhere. The management has already paid me to sing. - With your permission, I'll... - You do not have it. Then with the lady's permission. I didn't give you leave to address my daughter. Excuse me, sir, I believe the gentleman asked you to leave. It's bad manners to refuse a tip, friend. There was no need to interfere, gentlemen. Only trying to be helpful, Mr. Devereaux. - You know my name? - Everyone knows your name. I'm Bret Maverick, that's my brother Bart. Uh, this is a fortunate meeting for us, sir. We have connections with shipping offices... and they hope we might get a report on the River Princess. I do not do business at dinner, gentlemen. Besides, I have none to transact. Uh, they were also hoping that we might be aboard her maiden voyage. Come along, Yvette. - May I be of assistance, Mr. Devereaux? - Please, inspector. This ridiculous scene has gone far enough. Good night. Allow me to escort you, sir. Smoothly done, brother Bret. And it only cost us $500. - And that's not the worst of it. - No? The coffee is cold. For the waiter. You're awfully extravagant with my silver saddle. Uh, keep the change. - Inspector. - Pierre. Monsieur Devereaux. I am going to hold you responsible for this. You are going to leave for Belle Forest tomorrow. You think you can hold me prisoner at the plantation? If I had to until you have a husband who will do it for me. And have you chosen him for me? You are embarrassing me with your behavior. - Hotel Royale. - Excuse me, sir. Papa! - Bret. - Right. Hyah! Whoa! I'll be back. Did you lose them? They took the girl into one of those shops. The carriage drove on. - You go for the police. - Oh, we'll do better than that. We've got $500 riding on a personal invitation from Mr. Devereaux. - We'll get the girl ourselves. - Hey, you're right. She might get herself hurt if we waste time finding a policeman. It's five shops down. If I don't come out in 10 minutes, you come and get me. Don't move. Get your hands behind your head. Mister, that gun, drop it. - Now, pick it up. - Aah! - Run. - He's going to kill us. No, no. He's not from the police. - Yeah, I'm gonna carve him. - Jubal. Pardon me if I seem confused, but why didn't you run? Oh, you thought I was being kidnapped? Well, it's just a hazy impression I got when you screamed back there. - And so you tried to help me. - Yes. - I'm afraid I owe you an explanation. - Well, you might at that. You were at Maxim's tonight, you saw Jody. Jody is not only a café entertainer, he's also from the bayous. Which presents certain difficulties... because we are deeply in love. And my father... Doesn't want a muskrat trapper mudding the family tree. In a manner of speaking, yes. You see, I wasn't really kidnapped tonight. It was just a little subterfuge we had arranged. And later, Jody was to rescue me. And Papa's heart melts, and now he loves muskrat trappers... and you and Jody live happily ever after. Oui. - Well, we'll pretend I never found you. - Oh, you are most understanding. And luck to you and Jody. I think you'll need it. You ain't going anywhere, mister. Not until Jody says so. I think you're being much too cautious, Rick. And this melodramatic display of guns is ridiculous. Get over there. Sit down. Thanks. Jody? Yes. - Jody, we got a visitor. - Visitor? Yeah. - Oh, darling. - How did he get in here? Oh, Mr. Maverick, tried to rescue me, so I let... Quiet. How did you find this place? Well, I borrowed a horse. I hope it wasn't yours. There was another man with you. - My brother. - Where is he? Couldn't find a horse to borrow. I guess he's waiting at the hotel for me. Oh, Jody, I'm sure Mr. Maverick won't say anything. Either to my father or the police, so there's no reason to be so upset. No? Why didn't you take care of him? Well, we were waiting for you, Jody. And you? Are your brains all in your arms? Do I have to think of everything? I'm sorry if I make your boys nervous. Sit down. - Jody, what's wrong? - I said sit down. You've got some big surprises coming to you. I don't understand. Don't you? Didn't you finally get what you wanted? - You kissed a swamp rat. - Jody. I'm gonna get what I wanted. You're gonna write your father a letter. You're gonna tell the great Creole aristocrat that his daughter has been kidnapped. You don't mean that, Jody. You can't. Uh-huh. You tell him I want lots of money. You would've been better of if you had run. Run away from me? From the man who loved her passionately? No. Oh, no. Start writing. Go on, start writing. I'm afraid you missed the boat, friend. If it's money you're after... well, should you marry the girl, you'll get more. Think the money would be worth it? Having her inspecting my fingernails? Telling me how talk? There wouldn't be any money that way. If she married me, her old man would cut her off without a cent. Jody, didn't you know I loved you? I was proud of you. Mr. Maverick, I apologize for bringing you into this. Oh, forget it. How many of those Creole dollars are you asking for? Twenty-five thousand. Between the three of you? It is a three-way split. What's it to you? Well, I was just wondering if what you're doing is worth it. You're not getting an even cut? Well, you're taking the same risks. You know, Devereaux will pay 50 as fast as he'll pay 25. - And that would take care of my cut too. - Your cut? How else will you get the letter to Devereaux? Very simple, I mail it. That's simple all right. And dangerous. Every minute gives the police more time to close in. And if you bungle this... I stand a good chance of winding up dead. And you will bungle it. See, you're smart, Jody, but you don't have experience. Things have started to go wrong already. Don't you know that kidnapping isn't for amateurs? It's one of the most complicated crimes there is. Not one kidnapper in 20 ever gets to spend the ransom. You wanna end up in Cabildo prison with a rope around your neck? Who are you? Two years ago at Newton, Kansas, a cattlemen's bank was taken... for $125,000. Yeah. That's right. You? Me and my brother. That was a bank, this is ransom. Well, we don't do too much of that. It's too dangerous. Last time was Colorado, a year ago. Bart and I kidnapped Lucky Blare's son. Big mining man. He paid a hundred thousand. Where is that money now? Roaming the ranges of the panhandle. We put it into cattle. Oh, Miss Devereaux... if you'd like to take back that apology, I don't mind. You need help, Jody. Professional help. You need someone who can go to Devereaux tonight... get the money, get back here fast. So you can get out of town before the police close in. Now, only a professional can do that for you. Professional? Where would Devereaux raise that much money in the middle of the night? See? I said you're an amateur. He can cash a check at the casino. And your share? Five thousand. Heh. You think because I'm a bayou man, I'm stupid? Oh, no. Once you got your hands on that money... I'll stay here as a hostage just like Yvette. My brother Bart can collect the money. He's waiting outside. Rick, go see. That's not a healthy thing to do. He'll gun down anything that walks out of here. Unless I signal him not to. What kind of signal? He'll come in if I whistle a special way. If I whistled another way, he brings in the police. How will I know which way you're whistling? You won't. Whistle. All right, back in here. Is all that necessary? He won't need a gun to collect from Devereaux. Bret, are you all right? Come on in, Bart. Put away your gun, you won't need it. Let them have your gun. Oh, by the way, I don't think you've met Miss Devereaux. Miss Devereaux. Well, well, brother Bret, what have you got us into this time? Something you'll like, brother Bart. You'll like it a lot. The waterfront, the rooming houses, the dives. Search the entire Carré. Use what men you need. What can you tell us, sir, about the footman? Jubal has only been two days with us. The other night, my regular footman was robbed and beaten. I see now that was part of the scheme. You have the description? You will also find and arrest two men. Brothers. Using the names Bret and Bart Maverick. Young, dark-haired, well-dressed. You wish to add something, I believe, Mr. Devereaux? I will pay a $5000 reward for the safe return of my daughter. - You heard? - Yeah, sir. Well? I'm not sure that you are right in suspecting the two brothers. If they're innocent, they have nothing to fear. But I have seen these types before. It was no accident they were at the hotel. You told me they seemed bent... - on rescuing my daughter. - Seemed to be, Mr. Devereaux. I don't presume to tell you how to run your riverboats. I mean no disrespect, sir. Of course not. - My apologies. - Henri, we had best return to the hotel. Surely they will try to contact you there. Believe me, sir, you may depend upon the police. Now, you get it? Same routine we used with Lucky Blare. Now, what about the Hardy Colton method? Now, that would work too. No. It's not as good as the other in this case. All right. I gotta get something of hers so they'd know I've been here. Oh, that's beautiful workmanship. I'll take very good care of it, Miss Devereaux. All right. - Are you staying? - Try not to dawdle, brother Bart. Twenty minutes to 8. That gives us plenty of time. If you're not back by midnight or if the police come back with you... You don't have to spell it out. They may get me, but not before I put a bullet through him. Now, you hear him? Get going. Rick. Bart won't stray. Of course, when he starts back carrying all that cash... that would be a big temptation for an underpaid man like Rick. Rick? He wouldn't do that to me. He wouldn't? Oh, it's you again. You're back to redeem your silver saddle already? Maybe tomorrow. I see you refill shotgun shells. You use black powder? - What else? - Good. I want 2 pounds of it. Two pounds? That's a lot of powder. You don't often sell that much at one time. Two pounds. You got a powder bag? Just pour it right in here. Unh. One pound. Police are very busy tonight. So I notice. - What's up? - Well, one of our Creole moneybags... had his daughter kidnapped this evening. Two pounds. - It's bad business, kidnapping. - Yup. I wish him luck. The kidnappers? Take your pick. - How much do I owe you? - Uh... Ten dollars. You're kind of expensive. Black powder sells for a dollar, four bits a pound, friend. Only when they're reported as sales, filed with the police department. - But when one ain't filed... - Five dollars. Night. If you would've exhausted all the possibilities... - you would've found her by now. - New Orleans is not a small town. - A thorough search takes time. - But my... I wanna see Mr. Devereaux. Good evening. Remember me? I'm the one that jumped on the back of the carriage. - You are the man. - Yes, sir. My daughter, where is she? - She's safe for now. - Where? I'll have the place surrounded. A pretty quick way to get two people killed. - Two? - Yes, sir. They're holding my brother... - as hostage with her. - Who are they? You know a man by the name of Jody Collins? - He? - And two of his friends. They want $50,000. I'm supposed to bring it to them before midnight. He's lying, Mr. Devereaux. His brother is no more hostage than I am. I'm giving it to you straight. How can we be sure he knows where your daughter is at all? I think this is just a way to swindle you out of $50,000. Do you recognize this, Mr. Devereaux? - My daughter's. - Wh...? - Uh, monsieur... - Maverick. Bart Maverick. Monsieur Maverick, the necklace has convinced Monsieur Devereaux... that you have seen his daughter. But as his lawyer, I would like an explanation... as to why, if you are not a criminal... Collins entrusted you to act as go-between. Aside from your claim that he's holding your brother as hostage. Gentlemen, I would advise you listen to me carefully. The three of them were for dumping us into the harbor. We didn't much go for that. And it wouldn't have helped your daughter at all. We convinced them that we're old hands. We offered to collect the money for a cut. And of course, they put their trust in complete strangers. They're not the smartest boys in the world, inspector. That's why they're so dangerous. - You just asked for the money, why? - Because I might need it. To keep your daughter and my brother from getting killed. He's lying, Mr. Devereaux. They paid the headwaiter to put them next to your table this evening. We were hoping to get an invitation on the River Princess. Just why were you so anxious to get an invitation, monsieur? Bret and I like to play poker, Mr. Devereaux. We were expecting to find some interesting games on board. - We even expected to make a little money. - Gamblers. Professional gamblers. Look, if you don't wanna trust me with the money, say so. I'll try to clear Bret before they kill him. Just what assurance can you give me that Yvette will be released... if I give you the money? I can give you no guarantees. But you go along with me... I'll do my best for you. Bring him in. Monsieur Maverick... I place very little faith in your story. Even less in Americans. But my daughter's life is at stake. I will see you get the money. I'm glad you saw it my way, Mr. Devereaux. Oh. Inspector, they told me it would be all right for me to see you here. You have some information, Ziggy? Well, now, I ain't sure, inspector, but it... - Ah. - About the kidnapping? Maybe so. Because a while ago, that man came into my shop... - and bought 2 pounds of black powder. - You forgot to mention that. - Did I? - You deny you were at Ziggy's? This afternoon. I pawned a silver saddle. Here's the pawn ticket. And the powder was in a big manila envelope. It's inside his coat. Pardon me. Uh, he must've passed it already. - All right, Ziggy, you can get out. - Uh, sure, inspector, uh... Uh, I'll see you tomorrow. You'll have your money, Ziggy. Get out. Mr. Devereaux, I've got to insist, it's time for some proper police methods. Just what do you mean by that? Ziggy is a sewer rat but a useful one. He wouldn't lie to me. Two pounds of black powder would come in mighty handy... if the police should close in. - You really believe that? - What are you doing, inspector? At headquarters, he'll tell us where your daughter is. I can assure you of that. So you can go charging in like a herd of buffalo. If those boys panic, there's no telling what they might do. You'll write a note to your brother saying you're being held at headquarters... against the safe return of Miss Devereaux. That's very smart, inspector... but Jody doesn't give a hang whether I live or die. That deadline is still midnight, Mr. Devereaux. Why aren't they back yet? Oh, there's plenty of time. - Unless Rick tried to... - I told you I trust Rick. Stop cracking those things. That's quite an accomplishment. It takes muscle. You must be quite a man in the bayous, Jubal. Your Angelique must be a fine woman. My Angelique? Why, you should've seen the man I fought for her. She is beautiful, huh, Jody? Yeah, yeah, if you say so. Everybody says so, Jody. You know, Jody, you interest me. You have talent. - I hate to see talent go to waste. - What do you mean? Where are you heading when Bart brings the money back? Back to the swamps where they won't ever find me. With that money burning a hole in your pocket? That's too bad. - What else? - There are other cities... with rich men with wives, with daughters. You know, if the three of us put our minds to it... - Three? - Yeah. You, my brother and I. See, we have connections. We could introduce you, and after that, well... We've seen how you operate. Bart and I can outsmart most men... but with you... With me, it's the women, huh? Have you ever been out west? Seen how they just throw money away in San Francisco and Denver? And the Silver King. We'd go to San Francisco. You? Well, we'd like to take you and Rick along, Jubal... - but it just wouldn't work out. - Why not? You see, when a smart man wants some rough stuff done... well, he just hires a couple of men for chicken feed. That way, he can ditch them easier if things start getting tight. What do you mean? You keep trying, don't you? Well, I'm sure you'd be a great success in San Francisco, Jody. There must be many women who would be as foolish about you as I was. Maybe that makes you jealous. Then there's the east. Saratoga, Newport. Ah, women with husbands who could buy and sell Henri Devereaux. They've seen plenty of hand kissers and heel clickers. They want men, huh? - What are you laughing at? - Oh, I'm sorry. Perhaps I should cry. - Maybe you should. - Not for me, for you. What is it you really want, Jody? You'll be the man for so many women. Who will be the woman for you? Did I say I wanted one woman? Where would there be one woman for a man like me? The ones who think they're too good for me? The ones I know I'm too good for? Women like you? Or fat, muddy swamp-cows like his Angelique. Hold it! All right, outside, don't stop for anything. Give me your gun. Looks like we'll have to cancel that little partnership. Drop it. Now, you get back there. I appreciate that. I surely do. Getting tired, huh? You had a rough time. I'll give you credit. you're tough. But I think you're smart too. I'll talk to you in a way you can understand. Mr. Devereaux is offering $5000 reward for the return of his daughter. I'll make you deal. That address for half the reward money, and you and your brother go free. Look, inspector, I know this case is mighty important to you. You get that girl back and Devereaux is your friend for life. He might even make you chief of police. But I don't trust you as far as I could throw you. Which I'd truly enjoy doing. Mr. Devereaux. He has given you the address? Not yet, sir, but he will. You've got 20 minutes left, Mr. Devereaux. You're gonna left him take away your last chance to get your daughter back alive? - Release him. - But... At once, inspector. I've listened to you long enough. Sergeant. Here. All the money is here, monsieur. Perhaps you would like to count it, monsieur. No. I think it's about time you and I began trusting each other. My hat. I have a carriage outside. It's at your disposal. May I request that I go with you? No, thanks, Mr. Devereaux. I'm gonna have to do this alone. I don't want any police escort. No one trails me. My word of honor. Tell him. Order your men not to follow Mr. Maverick... or interfere in any of his movements. Yes, Mr. Devereaux. Monsieur... Yvette... she's the only one I have. You... - You will... - I know how you feel. Stop here. DRIVER: Whoa. Wait around the corner. Stop here, driver. Wait for me. How do we know what his brother is up to? - They're too smart for us. - For you maybe. - Jody, we gotta get out of here. - Where? Well, you're supposed to be the big boss, you tell us where. I must apologize again, Mr. Maverick. Better make this look friendly. - Did you get it? - It's here. Toss it over. Just like that? And he said you were smart. Toss it over. Don't you wanna see the color of the money? There's 2 pounds of black powder in this. We're walking out of here. You try anything and I'll touch this fuse. You're bluffing. Now, you drop it or I'll... You can pull that trigger, but I'd have time to light this fuse. You couldn't get away from it. He ain't bluffing, Jody. You can see it in his eyes. He ain't that willing to die. You're right. But I'd rather go this way than be shot by you. We'll all be buried together. I'm counting three. Bret, get her out of here. - Don't move. - One. - This ain't worth no thousand dollars. - I'm leaving here. - You're staying. Nobody leaves this place. We're all leaving. - Two. - I wanna get out too, Jody. If he touches that fuse, we're all dead. That's why he won't touch it. Maybe if it was just him, he would. But he won't kill his brother and Yvette too. Uh, look, I know him better than you. If he says he'll do it, he'll do it. You better drop those guns. He's getting too close to that fuse. It's gonna go off! I'll move it away when you drop those guns. I wanna get out of here. Will you let me go? Sure, Rick. Go on. Drop that gun. That goes for you too. That show you I mean business? You drop that or I'll give you the same thing. What are you gonna do, Jody? Keeping us standing here until we starve to death? - Aah! - Bart, come on! Oh, good evening, Miss Devereaux. Good evening, sir. Good evening. - I hope you are enjoying your cruise. - Beyond our wildest expectations. Yes, I've heard from some of my friends who have sat with you the game. Well, we have been pretty lucky. By the way, Yvette just told me something very shocking. You didn't tell me that she had agreed to be kidnapped. Oh, well, I thought I'd let her tell you, sir. That is, if she wanted to. I've always considered Americans... to be devoid of the qualities we Creoles value. You and your brother have shown me how very wrong I was. You also taught me that I can be proud of being an American. Then I guess it was worth it, Mr. Devereaux. Perhaps I had been a little bit too severe too with my daughter. Will you excuse me? Ha, ha. Good evening, sir. Oh, how is the shoulder? Oh, it's very painful. But with sympathetic attention, I'll recover. If you'll excuse me for a moment, gentlemen, I'll be right back. You'll have your revenge. So pappy left us a $1000 bill apiece... and some very profound words of wisdom. Oh? Never hold a kicker and never draw to an inside straight. Imagine being able to go where you want, do what you want. To be completely free. It must be a wonderful feeling. Oh, it has its drawbacks. Of course, you get to see a lot of new places, meet a lot of new people. But then, you always have to leave some people behind. Thank you for waiting, gentlemen.
