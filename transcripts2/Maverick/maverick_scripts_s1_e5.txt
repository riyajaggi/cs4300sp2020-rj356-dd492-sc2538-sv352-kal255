 Maverick (1957â€“1962): Season 1, Episode 5 - The Long Hunt - full transcript 
 Fleeing sore losers, Bret is saved from death by stage robber Lefty Dolan who obligates Bret with a dying wish - free the man wrongly convicted in another heist, instead of Lefty. Lefty lives long enough to clue in Bret to tracking 2 other menacing gang members, Rex and Whitey. When Bret cons his way into prison to talk to the innocent prisoner Jed, Bret's pledged to an even stranger promise - don't tell Jed's wife there's any hope of saving him. Citizen Kane-style cinematography, in the first of many Maverick episodes directed or written by Doug Heyes.

 There's an innocent man serving life for that job... and you're gonna get him out. I wouldn't try. From the entertainment capital of the world. Produced for television by Warner Bros. My name is Maverick. Named after my pappy. He's the man who said: "Hell has no fury like a man who loses with four of a kind." One of these friendly fellas had the four of a kind. Where did that shot come from? Get out of here.

 Oh, easy, easy. You wouldn't wanna go shooting me now. - After I saved your life. - I'm sorry. They left me just a wee bit nervous. - Where did you drop from? - Nice little ledge about 10 feet up. I was there waiting for the stage, lucky for you. Yes, indeed. You look kind of beat. Here, take a pull on this. Well, thanks. That's a funny place to wait for a stage. As good as any. I'm kind of glad you came along. Of course I could've handled this job by myself, but it's a lot more fun with two.

 - Job? - Hold up the stage. Oh, you wanna smoke? - Here. - Thanks. You know, when I was a boy... I always wanted to rob a stage. Somehow or another, I never got around to it. I hope this is not gonna be too big a disappointment to you... but I'm just an ordinary law-abiding citizen. Oh. What were you doing teasing that posse then? It wasn't a posse, friend. That was a passel of very disappointed poker players. One of the hazards to my profession, mister... - Dolan. Lefty Dolan. - I'm Bret Maverick. Well, I'm disappointed, Mr. Maverick. Here I figured you'd at least robbed a bank or something. Turns out you're only a tin-horn gambler. - Well, we can't all rob banks. - That's true enough. Our society is unevenly divided between the criminal and non-criminal classes. Me? I'm about as uneven as you can get. - Any criticisms, Mr. Maverick? - No. I never criticize a man who saved my life. And I never rob a man whose life I save. Even when I know he's carrying the winnings of a big poker match. And I don't even own a horse. Neither do I now. Own a horse. I still have the winnings. - Would you mind if I made a suggestion? - Ah, let me make it. Half of the money I've got is yours, you've earned it. No, that's no good either. Tell you what. You stake me the $30 cash... with the promise of a good horse and new outfit at the end of the line. And I'll buy my passage on that stage like a good citizen. Mr. Dolan, you've got yourself a deal. Now, I hope I bring you as much luck as you've brought me. I don't bring many people luck, Mr. Maverick. Ho, ho! Gents, if you're holding me up, you're sure gonna be disappointed. Us, hold you up? - Do we look like road agents? - Well, who don't? See, I've been robbed doing this run so many times... half the time I'm driving empty. Just like right now. Nobody is aboard and ain't nothing for you to take. Why, it never entered our heads. We just want to buy passage, is all. You mean... You mean paying customers? Well, sure, of course. Get in. Yes, sirree. This will be a pleasure. Yes, sirree. Company, by gingo. Get right in there. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Armed men up ahead, looks like another hold-up. Keep going! I can't afford to get killed. I'm running for mayor next month. Talk about luck. This could've been us holding us up. We wouldn't have gotten anything. Nobody'd be in here. Ho, ho! There goes my new horse and outfit. As soon as we stop, you step outside. You're alone, see. - Why take the chance? - Step outside. Ho. - You're the only passenger? - Afraid so. Slim pickings. Uh, no, not so slim. Carrying enough money for six men. Matter of fact, it used to belong to six men. - Thief or gambler? - Gambler. Well, your luck's run out. Drop your gun belt. Take a look in the coach. - Driver, you got some rope? - Yes, sir. Well, come down here and tie him up. You may be mayor yet. Good thing, we didn't hold it up, huh, Maverick? - Now, look what happened. - Lefty, I'll get you to the doctor. Horses don't run that fast. Maverick... I hate to remind you of this... - but I saved your hide this morning. - You did that. Now you gotta do something for me. Surest thing you know, but don't talk now. I got to. Something I gotta do. Five years ago, Dry Springs, Arizona... - four of us robbed a bank. - Yeah, Lefty? The bank teller was killed. A little while later, a man was arrested. Convicted. An innocent man... mistaken for me. I did a lot of rotten things in my life. But this is the only one I could never forget. Prison for life because he looked like me. Driver, get in here quick. I wanted you to hear something. What was his name? Ferris. Jedd Ferris. I never saw him. But I want you to promise me you'll get him out. Promise. I'll do what I can, Lefty. Who was with you? Don't ask question like that at time like this. What you want me to hear, mister? It doesn't matter now. "I'll do what I can." That's what I told Lefty before he died. But what could I do? Nothing. That's what I kept telling myself. You betting? But Lefty Dolan, wherever he was now... kept telling me different. He's out. What do you got? My hope, and this is all: two kings. Ahh... My two little pair takes it. You took two cards. - Holding a kicker, huh? - Nope. Three nines. Three nines. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Poker my friend is a game that requires concentration. Oh, do stick around. Sorry, something I gotta do before I go broke. It was a long time later that I paid a visit to Jedd Ferris. And in the meantime, I really had done all I could do. All anybody could do. Ferris? Jedd Ferris? Yeah, that's me. - Who are you? - I'm Bret Maverick. Oh, Mr. Maverick, since you've come to see me... and I've never heard of you, you must be bringing news. Bad as usual? Well, I wish I could say you were wrong, but... In way, you are. It's just that I know, you're innocent... but I can't prove it. Mr. Maverick, four reputable citizens swore they saw me in that bank. Now, how do you know I'm innocent? Because I was told so by the man you were mistaken for just before he died. But that changes everything. This is what I've dreamed of. They've gotta let me out now. Word of a dead man just doesn't seem to count. I've found that out. Then why did you come here? Just to torture me with a moment's hope? I'm sorry I came. I'm just trying to keep a promise to the man that told me the story. Friend of yours, I suppose. I only met him once. You know, I've always wondered about him. - And he really looked like me? - No. He's not as tall as you are, for one thing. A man holding a gun always looks tall. And he was left handed, and so am I. A newcomer in town. It's enough to hang anybody. They nearly hanged me. The territorial governor commuted it to life, and lost a lot of friends. Maybe that explains why he almost threw me out of his office. - You been to the governor? - Among others. Ferris, I'm sorry I came here. I can just see it makes things worse. Oh, no. I'm glad you did. I know now I'll never get out. But there's somebody who knows. Not just has faith but knows I'm innocent. You can't guess what that means. - I can imagine. - No, no, I don't think you can. You see, nobody saw me that day. I was out mending fence. I sometimes wonder if even my wife is really sure. Well, you've gone to a lot of trouble for me, stranger. Well, I try to do what I can. - I guess I'd better go. - Wait a minute. Would you mind doing just one thing more? - Sure. - Would you...? Would you call on my wife? She's still in Dry Springs. That little ranch is all we had and there were no buyers. I'd be mightily obliged if you'd give her a message. Oh, sure. I will tell her all about it. No, that's just what I don't want you to do. - What? - I want you to say just one thing. This: "Mrs. Ferris, your husband has not changed his mind. And he wants you to go ahead and do exactly what he told you to do. He won't take no for an answer." Got that, Maverick? That's all? That's all. You don't want me to tell her that I know you're innocent? I'd like your word you won't do that. All right, if that's the way you want it. Yeah, that's the way I want it. Thank you, Mr. Maverick. So there I was... playing Good Samaritan again. This time it had to be the end. But I still had an uneasy feeling that Lefty Dolan... was sitting on a silver cloud somewhere, pulling strings. Oh, howdy, stranger. - You looking for Mrs. Ferris? - Yes, I am. Should be back soon. She's taking a walk with her pa. - He's kind of poorly. Want to wait? - Well, I guess I'll have to. - My name is Bret Maverick. - Ben Maxwell. I'm own the spread just north of here. - Say, mind giving a hand with this board? - All right, sure. Whole place is practically falling down. She and her pa can't take care of it, seeing as how he's sick and all. - Well, you're being quite a help. - Well, somebody has to. - Are you a friend of Martha's? - No, I'm just delivering a message. Well, you can leave it with me, if you like. It's kind of personal. Oh. Oh, howdy, Martha? Look what I got for you: Mysterious stranger named Maverick bearing a message. - Your pa feeling better? - Yes, he's lying down. How do you do, Mr. Maverick? I'm Martha Ferris. You have a message? Is it from my husband? Well, yes, ma'am, something he wanted me to tell you. Won't you come into the house? - I'll tie your horse for you. - I'll fix you coffee. You must stay for supper. Well, I don't think I have time to stay for supper but coffee sure sounds fine. Sit down, Mr. Maverick. I've got some right on the stove. - You like cream and sugar? - No, ma'am, hot and black. - Just right. - Won't you sit down? How is Jedd? They don't let me see him as often as I'd like. He looked just fine to me. Is there any news, any hope of his getting out? I'm afraid there isn't. I... I thought that might be the message. No, ma'am. He asked me to tell you this. He hasn't changed his mind. And he wants you to go right ahead and do exactly what he told you to do. And he won't take no for an answer. - That was all? - Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Mr. Maverick, very much. I wish it could have been better news. Forgive me for asking, but... Well, anything to do with my husband is terribly important to me. Do you know him well? No, I only met him once. Just once and he gave you that message? I don't understand. I mean, were you in prison with him? - No, ma'am. - Well, then you must have visited him? You must have had a reason. They don't let just any... Well... See, they think he's a murderer. Why did you visit him, Mr. Maverick? I can't tell you that, ma'am. You know something about this case, don't you? - Very little. - But you do know something. Please tell me. Is there any hope for him? I told you, I'm afraid there isn't. But he's innocent. You know he's innocent, don't you? I just feel it, but you know it. Mrs. Ferris... I'm afraid there is nothing more I can say. I've given you the message. - Did he tell you what it means? - No. Then I'll tell you. He wants me to get a divorce and remarry. I can understand that, he's in prison for life. Can't look after you anymore. It's the last thing he could do for you, and the last thing that you could do for him. I won't do it. Someday, they'll find out the truth and he will be free. Mrs. Ferris, I wouldn't wait for that. I'm going to wait. I'm sorry. Good bye. - Maverick? - Yeah. You, uh, got news of Ferris? - I told you, it was personal. - No, I didn't mean to pry into that. I was just hoping that you had news about him getting out maybe. - You're hoping? - Well, that's the only way... I'll ever stand a chance with her. As long as he's in prison, she'll never turn her back on him. I think you're right on that last point, anyhow. I know I'm right. I know her real well by now. This is worse than fighting a ghost. But if he got let out, well, he is only human. I might have a better chance against him then. I'd call it a pretty slim chance. Yeah, they will never let him out. Whole world knows he's guilty. Well, no. No, he's not guilty. - What? But four people saw him. - They were wrong. It's happened before. What makes you so sure? Well, I can't say. But it doesn't make any difference. I can't do anything about it. That's too bad. - You move around a lot, don't you? - Quite a lot. If you ever hear anything and there is anything I can ever do... to help Jedd Ferris get out of prison, remember me. Ben Maxwell. Will you do that? - I'll do that. - Right. Oh, uh, before you go, would you help me place this timber? Sure thing. Always happy to help out. Well, I got away from there with nothing worse than a broken arm. But I was wondering, if the ghost of Lefty Dolan... hadn't hit me with that board... just for thinking I'd done enough to settle our account. Because Lefty wasn't going to let me forget that promise. Two months later, 200 miles away... he nudged me again... as sharp as if he'd been sitting by my side. Three Kings. - John? - I'm busted, James. - Hauling my freight. - Sorry to hear that. - Anybody else care to sit in? - I'll take a whirl. Five hundred assorted colors. Everybody gets his chance here. Shuffle and deal. - And if I lose I can't complain. - Oh, you can complain, all right. Just won't do you any good. Yeah, like the bank robber said to the cashier. Hey, Rex, look at that left-handed deal. - Remind you of anyone? - Yeah. Only Dolan dealt them faster. Here he was again, Lefty Dolan. Both these men had known him, maybe the whole story. It looked like he was out to haunt me for the rest of my life. I had to have a little private talk with these boys. And I figured I'll get farther if I got one of them alone. But that wasn't easy to arrange. They were partners, sharing the same hotel room... and they were leaving town in the morning. I had to separate them. Now. I'll take three cards. Four hours later came a crucial hand. The game was stud. On the last round dealt only Rex, Whitey and I were left. Rex had two 10s showing. Whitey had a pair of eights. I had two queens. Three pair showing. Not bad for a round of stud. I had been playing poker with Rex for a week and I was sure of one thing: On the way he had bet the hand so far... he wasn't bluffing, he had the third 10. And I was equally sure of Whitey. He had the third eight. And the thing I was sure about of all was that I had the third queen. That made it my pot, but I didn't want to win it. They might both quit and go home... and I'd have no chance for a nice private chat about Lefty Dolan. And yet, if I just dropped out... then Rex would take the pot... after I had been working all night to bust him. That would put him back in business, the game might go on till morning. Somehow, I had to throw the pot to Whitey... who had the weakest hand of all. I'll check it to you, Rex. Being real cute, aren't you? Kind of make me believe you got that third queen. You know something, I don't think you have. I know I got three 10s. So I'll just bet $200. You're a real good bluffer, Rex. One of the best. - Think so? - I think so. What do you think, Whitey? I think so too. I'll just see you that, and raise another 200. Well, come on, come on, better drop. And if you bet, better have the right hold card. Oh, I have, Rex. What'd you think? There's your 200, Rex. And there's yours, Whitey. And I think I'll just raise it... two hundred more. As you say, "bet or drop." It's gonna cost you 400 dollars to see my third queen. I can see you don't have that much. I'll take your I-owe-you, but I'd really rather not. Why don't you forget it while you still got enough for breakfast. You got more luck than 16 Irishmen on a shamrock field on St. Patrick's Day. You've been catching big cards all night. True. I'm out. Well, Whitey... let's not be greedy. Lot of money in that pot. What do you say we split it? This was a critical moment. If he dropped, too, I'd won a pot, and lost the game I was after. Split it. You wouldn't offer to split if you had that third queen. I'll just see you, mister, right now. You got that third eight? Bet I have. You got that third queen? No, just two pair. Thought you trying to run one on me. Bluffing. Great jumping Jehoshaphat, and I dropped. That should've been my pot, not you with your lousy eights. Poker is a fascinating game, don't you think? Fascinating, my fat Aunt Fanny's eye ball. Fetch me and then keep the change. Uh, gentlemen, I think it's my deal. Poker. Ha! Unless you're Fanny Davenport with $10,000 in each hand, you can fly away. You. Mind if I talk to you, Rex? You cockeye right I mind. You cost me $800 tonight. Luck of the game, lad. You mention a friend of mine early in the evening, Lefty Dolan. - A friend of yours. Since when? - Oh, about six months ago. A little job together. Wyoming stage. Nothing big, just two passengers on board and one of them was broke. Wasn't that bad. The other man had $1400 on him. Heh, that's better. But there's a little mix-up. When we left, there was a bit of shooting. We went different directions. I've been looking for Lefty ever since to see if I could give him his part of the take. - How is that again? - Well, you see, I got it all. Seven hundred dollars of that belongs to him. So I was hoping maybe you can tell me something about him. - I can tell you where he is. - You can? Where? - He's dead and buried. - No. In fact, he died in my arms. Is that so? How did it happen? Uh... He caught a bullet. Well, what do you know about that? He told me all about you before he died. You know something? He owed me some money, and he made me his heir. He did? Yeah, he made a verbal will leaving me everything. Of course, it wasn't enough to cover what he owed me, but everything helps. So you can give me that $700. Well, that's a terrible shame... that they don't recognize verbal wills in Wyoming. Yeah. - Well, it was worth a try. - Sure, it was. - Have a drink. - Don't mind if I do. - Poor Lefty. - Oh, yeah. Too bad he had to get it in a two-bit stage heist... after all the heist, greater stuff he pulled. Yeah. He's been in some big operations, all right. You know, he told me about that little Dry Springs fracas. We must have made $10,000 apiece on that one. - How long do you think you'd lose it? - About three minutes. And what was that you said? You know, that little dust-up at Dry Springs a few years back. One with Lefty Dolan and Whitey. You know, I don't think I know what you're talking about, mister. Oh, I think you do. There's a man serving life in prison for that job and you're gonna get him out. I wouldn't try that. Don't try anything, son. We got a lot more hardware than you have. - Whitey is getting away. - Just don't you try to get away. - That man's dead. You shoot him? - No. The gun is still hot. All right, so I did some shooting. I had to. The man who started this is getting away. Now, don't you worry, son. We'll take care of him soon enough, if he needs it. Look, you gotta get a posse and start after him right now. - And you'll go along with them. - You bet I will. And then just fade away to the dark like smoke, huh? Nothing of the kind. Look, are you the sheriff? No. But I think like he does. Come on, boy, let's go. Why did you go there? Because I'm a stupid idiot. Doesn't know enough to mind his own business. - But I didn't kill Rex. - Yeah? - How do you know? - How do I know? It was dark, wasn't it? The lamp was shut out. Bullets from three guns were buzzing around like bees. - Is that the way it was? - Yes. Your gun is a .45, so was the dead man's. And he was killed with a .45. Suppose I was to tell you that the third gun, this Whitey's, was a 38. Then I'd say I killed him. But he was shooting at me. - Even break, huh? - Sure. - No, not exactly. - Well, never mind that. It doesn't matter. So the third gun wasn't a .38. - What? - I was just supposing that, remember? No. All the bullets... from the guns were the same. Forty-five. Well, then maybe one of them was Whitey's bullet. That's right. But there's no way of knowing for sure. You don't know yourself. I never saw a case just like this before. The jury wouldn't know what to do. They'd have to acquit you both. So, what's the use of arresting anybody? And I ain't gonna go looking for Whitey. Nor... holding you. Young man... would you do one thing for me? I guess so. What is it? Get out of town, will you? It's really embarrassing having you around. I rode south, straight toward the Mexican border... because that's the way Whitey had gone, six hours ahead of me. I figured that's the way Lefty Dolan would have wanted it. Whitey was an easy man to follow, with that white hair and that young face. Somebody always remembered seeing him. Then, one day's ride from the border and with night coming on... I recognized the country I was at. And I knew where I could find help. - Well, Maxwell, remember me? Maverick. - I sure do. Come in, come in. You still wanna get Jedd Ferris out of prison? - More than ever. - I'm trailing one of the men... who robbed that bank, man called Whitey. Tall, thin, white hair, young face, riding a red roan. He's making his way to the Mexican border, a few hours ahead of me. That won't make a difference. I'll have my men on the trail by sunup. We'll bring him back, no matter what side of the border. Good. Say, do you mind if I sit down for a while on something that doesn't move? Oh, you must be pretty tuckered. - Why don't you sleep here tonight? - Accepted. Say, before you get too relaxed... Oh. I hate to suggest any more riding, but Martha's... What about Martha? We buried her father three days ago and she's feeling awful low. This news of yours would sure perk her up. Might let her down later on. No, no. She needs to hear something good right now. And we'll bring him back. When he gets to Mexico, he will feel safe. - That's when we'll take him. - Tsk. - Yeah, maybe you are right. - I know I am. Hearing what you got to say will be a big help to her... right now when she needs it most. Well, I guess a few more miles won't hurt me. I'd like to be there when you tell her, but I've got to start getting things ready. - I'll be back in an hour. - Good. Hey. You know, I sure do wish there was someone there with her. She's all alone accept for a housekeeper, about 90 years old. You're not worried about Whitey. I doubt if he'd stop around here anywhere. But he might, looking for food or change a mount. Maybe you're right again. I'll sleep in the barn. I'll be back at sunup. I'll have everything ready. What I ought to do is gun you down, get myself a flesh wound, be a big hero. You wouldn't do that after I'd come all this way to warn you. I didn't need warning. I know all about Maverick. Met him months ago, got him on my side. - How was I to know that? - No way. But you knew he was trailing you. So you lead him right to me. Smart. It was all I could do to get him out of here. Now you've gotta beat it. Well, sure, Ben. I'll head for the border. No, you idiot. That's the direction he'll be looking. Where I'll be looking too, with my men. You ride straight north, that's one direction he won't look. I'll get started. Wait a minute. There's a light in the bunk house. Some curious cowpoke wondering who is up at this hour. Wouldn't do to be seen leaving. Better wait till midnight. They'll all be snoring by then. Miss Ferris, I know it's little late for a visit, but... Mr. Maverick, I'm sorry. Oh, come in. I didn't mean to startle you, but... Well, both Ben Maxwell and I felt that there were some things... you ought to know tonight. Teresa, would you make us some coffee. - Won't you sit down. - Thank you. - You've seen Jedd again, haven't you? - Well, no ma'am, I haven't. But there is a chance if things work out right... that we'll all be seeing him very soon. If things work out right? Tell me what happened? I ran into two of the men who helped rob the bank. One of them is dead now and the other is trying to get across the border. But Ben will have his men on the trail at dawn... and I think we'll bring him in. Thank God. I knew I was right, never to stop hoping. Thank you, Mr. Maverick, very much, for coming and telling me. - I just hope it works. - It will. I know it will. I guess you know that Ben Maxwell is in love with you. Yes. But I've told him I'd never marry him. How long have you known him? - Five years. Ever since the trial. - The trial? - Didn't he live here before then? - No. Why? What's wrong? Oh, Maxwell was going out of his way to get me out of his place tonight. I just felt that he would want to come here and tell you the news... and what he was gonna do about it. But he insisted that I do it. That just doesn't fit. - He first showed up here at Jedd's trial? - Well, a lot of people came to the trial. But... Well, Ben was there every day. He told me later... that he kept coming there because he'd fallen in love with me. He said that was the reason he bought the ranch next to mine. Just a stranger passing through. No, he came here looking for ranch property. And dropped in at the trial and fell in love with you. He is in love with me. I've never wanted it, but I know that it's real. I believe it is too. Would you know how much he paid for that ranch? Yes, we all knew the price that they were asking, 10,000. Ten thousand? The men who robbed that bank... were they wearing anything to cover their faces? Yes, they wore bandanas. One man's fell off. The left-handed man Jedd was mistaken for. Of course, it fits. It all fits. What are you talking about? Of the four men who robbed that bank, I'd found three of them. Now, what happened to the fourth man? I can tell you what might have happened. When a man was arrested and brought to trial for that robbery... the fourth man came back to see the trial. Maybe to see how he stood or just out of curiosity, but he came back. Now, he knew he was safe because no one had seen his face. Whatever his plans were, he changed them. Seeing a face like yours has changed the plans of a lot of men. No, it's not true, it can't be. Well, it's just suspicion. No. Because Whitey wasn't headed for border at all. He was leading me straight to the fourth man, Ben Maxwell. All right, nobody stirring. Time for you to get out of here. Wait, turn off the lamp. You sure no one saw you putting your horse in the barn? - Yeah. - All right, take him out quiet. Walk him out of earshot. When I set my men looking for you in the morning... I don't want anyone wondering if I had a visitor outside of Maverick tonight. Take it easy, Whitey. Don't look so scared. All you have to do is write your name on a piece of paper. That's all I want from you. - Sign your name under the writing. - What does it say? Just tell the truth about the little bank robbery... back about five years, and it clears Jedd Ferris. - And puts me right in the middle of it? - That's right. What makes you think I would sign that? So you can get on your horse and ride for the border. Heh, I ain't signing nothing. They'll never prove that job on me. Maybe not. But there's another matter. Your friend Rex died, you know. - I'll never kill Rex. - Oh, yes you did. Who's gonna prove it? You were shooting too. But I was using a .38. Rex was killed with a .45. At least that's what the sheriff said. That's why he let me go and he's looking for you. - It's a .45 you're holding now. - It's a different gun. Sheriff took the other one, part of the evidence. And I've got the rest of it right here. Your gun and you. You know, there's two sheriffs looking for you, Whitey. Mrs. Ferris is on way her way here right now with the local one. So you haven't got much time. Give me the paper. Hunker down in that corner over there before you strike that match. Now, you forget about the matches. I'll tell you what it's says: "I, the undersigned, helped rob the bank at Dry Springs on May 8, 1872. The four men who did the job... are Whitey Brandon, Rex Clark, Lefty Dolan and Ben Maxwell... who owns the Rock and Star ranch outside of Dry Springs. And Jedd Ferris didn't have anything to do with it." Now here is a pencil. Write your name. Hold it, Maverick. Step away from him, Whitey. Don't move. Up. Sorry I have to do that. It'll look much better if you're killed with Whitey's gun. All right, boys, stay back. This is the sheriff. Everything is under control. - You made good time. - Did he sign? No, Ben shot him first. - Right. - Ben. - Right. It's the paper. He wants the paper. Thank you, Ben. Two months later, Jedd Ferris came home to stay. And it had taken almost a year out of my life, off and on. But now it finally seemed worth it. Well, how about it, Lefty? Will you leave me alone now? Well, there weren't any lightning flashes of thunderbolt... so I guess it was all over now. And I was firmly reminding myself of one of the last... and most important things my pappy ever told me: "Love your fellow man. Stay out of his troubles, if you can."
