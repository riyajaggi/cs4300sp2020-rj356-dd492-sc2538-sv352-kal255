 Maverick (1957â€“1962): Season 1, Episode 11 - The Wrecker - full transcript 
 Bret Maverick wins the right to join a ring of shipwreck salvagers, but he is soon in debt up to his neck when he engages in a spirited bidding contest, spending $21,000 for a ship whose cargo is apparently only worth half that. Brother Bart soon finds out why their unknown rival was willing to bid so high - in addition to a bales of silk and rice, the wreck's hold is full of illegal opium.

 You fools! That's money you're heaving over the side. Money! You better never let me come across your bows again... ...either of you... ...because I will slice you up into pieces too small for bait. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - May I help you? - I'm looking for Maverick. I hope you haven't lost him, he's an old friend. - May I ask your name? - Maverick. Well, of course, Mr. Maverick. Mr. Maverick is expecting you. - He's in Room 119. - Thank you.

 - How long has the game been going on? - Oh, four days. Uh... What game? [CHUCKLES] There's your thousand. I'll put up another thousand. I'm a man of deep faith, Mr. Longhurst. Not misplaced, I trust. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. - Mr. Maverick. - Bart. Ha, ha. - How are you? - Hello, Bret. Good to see you. Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet my brother. Mr. Longhurst, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Williman, Mr. Marchese. Gentlemen, my honor.

 If you'll excuse me, I have some business for the moment with Mr. Longhurst. Go ahead. Now, Mr. Longhurst, I believe it's your call. Your thousand and up three. Well, I'll just call... ...and 3000 more. I don't happen to have 3000 more with me at the moment, Mr. Maverick. - Well, your word is good, Mr. Longhurst. - Thank you. Very well. I call. At this point, gentlemen, I have a proposition. I hold lOUs from each of you, gentlemen, for some $6000. Are you implying that those won't be made good? I know they will be. But you owe 3000 in the pot, Mr. Longhurst. Now, if I win the pot... ...we'll call the 3000 square, and I'll tear up the lOUs in the bargain. Well, from the way you play poker, Mr. Maverick... ...I can come to the conclusion that you're giving us $9000... ...in the name of mercy. Just what is your proposition? The $9000 buys me into the ring. We've turned down much better propositions, Mr. Maverick. No doubt. But, here, it's a matter of poker. Poker is a matter of nerve... ...and nerve is a matter of how much a man's got. If it's a question of nerve, Mr. Maverick... ...I think my partners and I will agree to your proposition. Especially since I believe I have the winning hand. I have the ace you were wondering about, Mr. Longhurst. - Welcome to the ring, partner. - Thank you, sir. - Nice to have met you, Mr. Maverick. - Thank you, sir. Oh, uh, incidentally, there's an auction tomorrow morning. My partners and I are not particularly interested. It's a little small for us. Well, I don't mind beginning in a small way. The name of the ship is the Flying Scudd. - Good evening, Mr. Maverick. - Good evening. Well, I thought I needed you to help me swing the deal... ...but I did it myself with a pair of aces... ...and a fair knowledge of the grand game of poker. [BART CHUCKLES] I suppose I should be happy for you, brother Bret. But for what? What's "the ring"? The ring buys up wrecked ships at auctions. It's always been closed tighter than a loan shark's fist to outsiders. Nobody bids against them. But enough of that. Tonight, I'm gonna show you the city of San Francisco. So you can't say that I brought you on a wild goose chase. - Yeah, but what--? - The questions can wait. When this night's over... ...you're gonna wonder why there's still people living east of the Rockies. [CROWD MURMURING] - Good morning. - Bret. Good morning, sir. Watch the way it'll work. I'll take the first bid, Longhurst will have the second. Gentlemen, we are here to offer a vessel, the Flying Scudd, at auction. She is valued at $10,000, including rice and fine silk from the orient. The Flying Scudd is beached at Midway Island... ...and the buyer assumes all responsibility for taking her off. How much will it cost to bring her back here? Oh, a thousand at the most. We're getting her for 300, leaving some $8000 profit. If you're ready, gentlemen, I should like to hear an opening bid. - One hundred dollars. - Thank you, sir. I am offered $100. - One-fifty. - Thank you, Mr. Longhurst. - Two hundred dollars. - Two hundred. - Two-fifty. - Two-fifty. Three hundred dollars. I defer to Mr. Maverick. The bid is $300. Do I hear more? If not-- MAN: I-- I... Three hundred and fifty dollars. [CROWD MURMURING] There is a bid of $350 from, uh, that gentleman. - Four hundred. - Four hundred. Four-- Four-fifty. He in the ring? No. - Five hundred. - I have a bid of $500. Five hundred and fifty dollars. Five hundred and fifty dollars. Looks like the gentleman doesn't know you're supposed to get the Flying Scudd. Could be you're getting whipsawed, Bret. - Six hundred. - Six hundred dollars. Six hundred and fifty dollars. - Mr. Markham. - At your service, Mr. Longhurst. - One moment, if you please. - Certainly, sir. Gentlemen, would you mind? What's going on, Mr. Longhurst? I thought we were supposed to get this ship. I'm just as surprised as you are. I have no idea who the fellow is. Are you sure of that, Mr. Longhurst? Quite sure, Mr. Maverick. You have my word. And to prove our good faith... ...and to let our little friend there know that he's made a big mistake... ...the ring will back your bid up to $5000. Seven hundred dollars. Four thousand and fifty dollars is the bid. - Five thousand. - Mr. Maverick's bid is $5000. Do I hear an advance of that bid? Five thousand five hundred. AUCTIONEER: Five thousand five hundred dollars. That's it, Mr. Maverick. The ring will not back you beyond 5000. Look, mister-- Mr. Markham, may I have a minute, please, sir? Uh, Mr. Markham, if Mr. Maverick wants to top my bid... ...I demand he do it immediately or drop out. I shall give Mr. Maverick exactly one minute. No more. There's something somebody wants on the Flying Scudd. She's not worth even 5000 to us where she stands. Then you're dropping out of it, Mr. Longhurst? If your brother wants the Flying Scudd, he takes her on his own responsibility. What do you think, Bart? Fifty-five hundred dollars is a lot of money for rice and silk. Even if you're a hungry dressmaker. Well, maybe it's not just rice and silk that somebody is after. Then somebody looked at the whole card. Could be. You know there's a war on in China. Now, that is exactly what I've been waiting to hear you say. It explains everything. No, look, you don't see it. Bullion, gold. Maybe smuggled out of China on the Flying Scudd. Unless it's some kind of a squeeze. Between Longhurst and that fellow that's bidding against you. Can't be. We can drop out now and leave them holding the bag... ...for what they've already bid. Besides, I know Longhurst and his reputation. This is between us and the little man. Time's up, Mr. Maverick. Do you wish to bid? I'm with you, Bret. Go ahead and bid. - Six thousand. - Six thousand dollars is Mr. Maverick's bid. - Six thousand one hundred. - Six thousand and one hundred dollars. The bid is $18,700. Mr. Maverick's bid. I... Uh... Eighteen-- No, no-- Uh, nineteen thousand. Gentleman says $19,000. [CROWD MURMURING] - Well, as Pappy used to say... - Faint heart never filled a flush. That's right. Go ahead. I'm gonna have to leave my head with the loan shark to get the money. You'd rather be rich than ugly, wouldn't you? Bid. - Twenty thousand. AUCTIONEER: Twenty thousand dollars. Twenty thousand five hundred. AUCTIONEER: Twenty thousand five hundred dollars. - Twenty-one thousand. - Twenty-one thousand. Mr. Markham, I beg your indulgence. I'm not representing myself but my principal. And I've already gone $500 over my authorized limit. I take it then, sir, you wish to drop out? No, no, no, I just want 20 minutes in which to see my client... ...and see if he wants to, uh... I'm sorry, sir, that's against rules and policy. We may not hold up a sale. But I assure you, sir, I'll be back. I've-- Mr. Maverick's bid was $21,000. Do you wish to top that? The Flying Scudd is yours, Mr. Maverick. [GAVEL BANGS] Well... ...it's ours. - What is ours, brother Bret, for 21,000? - Next question. You've made a purchase, Mr. Maverick. There are formalities, papers to be signed. There's more money in my bag at the hotel. It's all yours. [SLURRING] What do you want? I'd like to buy your next drink, mister, uh...? My name is Bellairs. Thomas Bellairs. It's my pleasure, Mr. Bellairs. Oh, uh, my name is Bart Maverick. Pretty stiff bidding back there, Mr. Bellairs. Somebody must have really wanted the Flying Scudd. [SOBBING] What's the trouble, Mr. Bellairs? You two did me out of a fortune. I could've bought that boat for nothing. You pocketed the difference between nothing and 20,000? Why did you do it to me, hmm? It was open bidding, Mr. Bellairs. Yeah, but I got a limit. My client... Who is your client? I am not privileged to divulge that information. - Well, why did he want the Flying Scudd? -Why? I don't know. He just came to me. I'm a lawyer. He just came to me. - Who? - Mister-- Oh, no, you don't. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Well, it's just a shame about the commission. You did me out of it. What's that for? If you tell me who your client is, that $500 is yours. Client's business is privileged. I can't tell. Nope, nope. It's not your fault he put a limit on what he'd pay. That's right. [BART CHUCKLES] Your obligation to him has ended. Now, I am your client... ...and your first commission is to tell me who bid on the Flying Scudd. The $500 is the fee, huh? "James Dickson." Is this the right address? Mr. Maverick, I'm proud to have you as a client. - Bellairs? - Telegram for Mr. Dickson. Put it under the door. BART: All right, Mr. Dickson. There's no telegram. - Who are you? - My name is Maverick. I want a talk with you. I don't know you. You have no business with me. BART: It's about the Flying Scudd. - What about it? - I own her now. Since you wanted the ship so badly... ...I thought we might get together and discuss it. Go away. Go away and leave me alone. What's on the Flying Scudd, Mr. Dickson? Get away. I don't wanna see you or talk to you. I warn you, sir. Get away. Dickson. Dickson. Nope, I don't know the name. I waited around for two hours. He wouldn't come out. What did you learn? The ship is registered with the commission. Is that all? Her master was a Captain Wicks. - Where is he? - Nobody knows. - What? - It's true. A British man-of-war picked up Wicks and his crew... ...after the Flying Scudd had been beached at Midway. Soon as Wicks got to San Francisco, he notified the commission. The commission got in touch with the owners... -...and they put the ship up for auction. - And the rest of the crew? Right into thin air. - Why, Bret? Why? - Shall we find out? [CHUCKLES] Glad to. How? Why, there are hundreds of waterfront dives, seamen's hangout. A secret's pretty hard to keep. Somewhere, some place there ought to be someone... ...who knows at least one of the crew. We just pass the word around that we're looking for one of them... ...and offer money for information. - How much? - Bart, I haven't got a nickel. I've signed notes to get what we needed. Sixty-day notes. How much am I in for? Well, you said, "Take it." - You saved me a collar button? - A brass one. [BART CHUCKLES] All right. Let's start passing the word. [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [SNICKERING] [CHUCKLES] Jamie Craven? My name is Maverick. Hoist, hoist, sail and move on. Beat it! Sit down. If the scuttlebutt's right, you're looking for some of the crew from the Flying Scudd. That's right. You got a good reason? I've got a reason. Have you got a price? There's a man living at the Square Regal Hotel. His name is Jerome Braus. I'll kill him. CARTHEW: No. - What did he come here for? What he want? He knows all about it, Mr. Carthew. He knows. - What's gonna happen with the--? - Shut up. - It's all right. Don't worry. - It ain't all right. Why buy the Flying Scudd if it's all right? - That boat was bought for salvage. - For over $20,000? I say get rid of him once and for all. We can breathe again. Now, that's enough. It's all right for you, Mr. Carthew. You've got enough money to get yourself lost. - You had your share. - Yeah, little enough it was for what I've-- Now, you shut up and listen. You've got to get out of here. I'll give you enough money to satisfy even you... ...but be where I can find you. I ask you again, what about him? When and if it becomes necessary, I'll take care of him. Oh, I should have known. Somebody was watching my every move. Shall we go back and do some skull tapping? No, it's too late. That fellow, Jerome Braus or whatever his name is, he's long gone. After the Flying Scudd. What if they beat us to it? Dickson, the fellow that was bidding on the ship... ...he'd have enough money to hire a ship and a crew. That's what we've got to do fast. With what? [BART CHUCKLES] Hey, there might be a skipper who's willing to make the trip. - On a percentage deal. - What kind of a skipper? We can't pick and choose, brother Bart. We have to take what the devil sends us. You don't have the money to hire me or my ship. Yet you say you are willing to make a deal? You are the one who is leading. You do the offering. My brother and I paid $21,000 for the Flying Scudd. [LAUGHING] The story got around. Either you know something or you're a pair of fools. [BART CHUCKLES] Guess which, captain. Eh... But you don't look like the fool. But I don't know about your brother. Well, take my word for it, I've known him a long time. If he ever does anything foolish, it costs other people money. Make your deal, Mr. Maverick. Ten percent for you and your crew. Not enough to pay for the job of close-hauling the jib. Fifteen. I've got to have a crew of at least six. After I finish paying them off, I'll be holding a slack line. You're slick as a greased axle, captain. - Well, I might as well go my limit. Twenty. - Forty. The limit just went up. - Thirty. - Thirty-five. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if you flew the Jolly Roger. Thirty-five it is. Tomorrow morning good enough, Mr. Maverick? Can you get a crew together that soon? You have yourself aboard the Nora Karina tomorrow morning. The crew is my lookout. [BART CHUCKLES] And don't expect a flock of smiling angels. [LAUGHS] I've seen better crafts hauling bait for a fishing boat. She floats, that's all we can ask for. You know, I'd still think you gave me a fast shuffle. You take a nice ocean cruise, while I stay here and fight off the creditors. [BART CHUCKLES] If I'm not back in 60 days, put up a good fight. You know, Bart, look, we've been broke before, but not dead. Why don't we just forget the whole thing? NARES: Better come aboard, Mr. Maverick. We're ready to move out into the narrows. I want to get underway with the turn of the tide. Take care. Well, captain, I hope it's a nice trip. - Your quarters are aft, Mr. Maverick. - Thank you. All hands stand by to cast off! [KNOCK ON DOOR] Come in. Take that away. You waiting around for me to die? CARTHEW: People rarely die of seasickness, sir. Wait a minute. What's your name? Matthew Higgins, sir. - Don't I know you? - No, sir. You better eat some food, sir. Get out of here. [NARES CHUCKLES] Your belly back on an even keel, Mr. Maverick? Well, I've decided to go on living, captain. Very thoughtful of you to send that food down... ...my condition to the contrary. [CHUCKLES] The man who brought it was also thoughtful. He said his name was Matthew Higgins. What do I care if his name is John Beelzebub? I needed a crew and I got one. Higgins? Higgins. Stand aft here. - Captain? - Maverick ever see you before, Higgins? - No, why? - Just asking. What's aboard the Flying Scudd, Mr. Higgins? I paid you $2000 to get to Maverick and take me aboard this ship. There's nothing else you need to know. [CHUCKLES] You're right, Mr. Higgins, if that's your name. Land, ho! - Is that the ship, captain? - Yes. Hung up by an underwater reef, from the look of her. I wanna get to the Flying Scudd as soon as possible. Higgins? You'll go ashore with Mr. Maverick and me. The rest of you, scout the island for fresh water and for fruit. Ever been to Midway, Mr. Higgins? No, sir. Never. Neither have I. It should prove interesting. Like a grave, she is. Now, let's get to the hold and look at that cargo. Yeah. Higgins, see if there's some oil in that lamp there, will you? Aye, aye, sir. Aye, it's rice, all right. Silk. Well, I guess this whole cargo isn't worth more than $3000. Captain, I want your men to tear this ship apart. - Apart? - Every inch of it. Oh, I see what you mean, Mr. Maverick. You figure there's something hid here. I want all of us to be happy... ...especially me. Higgins, go get the rest of the crew. Tell them to bring crowbars and axes from the Nora Karina. And bring them right back here. Aye, aye, sir. Did, uh, you take a good look at this ship as we came up on her? Is there something I missed? If you know the first thing about sailing... ...you would see that this ship could be lifted off this reef. Lazy as taking a baby out of a crib. And no captain worth a rotten piece of line would leave his ship... ...when there's half a chance of saving. Now, I ask myself and I ask you, Mr. Maverick, why? Why was she left here? [BANGING AND HAMMERING] So far no sign of anything. So far we've only torn her half apart. Keep trying, captain. All right, Higgins or Dickson. Never buck the odds when they're this high. Better give me that. You'll have to kill me to get it. Look, Maverick, if it's money you want, you can have it. Any amount. Oh? How much money do you have, Mr. Dickson? We'll go back to San Francisco, to my bank. Everything there is yours. I'd rather see that. I said, you'd have to kill me first. I meant it. I could shoot that knife out of your hand before you had a chance to use it. - You'd kill me. - What makes you think that would stop me? I don't know... ...but it's up to you. I've played enough poker to know when a man is running a bluff. - You're not. - That's right. [CREW CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] There you are, Mr. Maverick. - What is it? - Opium. - Where was it? - In dry space. The Flying Scudd was smuggling opium. Yeah. Qr was about to when she was beached. How much is this stuff worth? Ten, 12,000. Depends on the market. That still doesn't make 20,000. No, no, it isn't, but, uh, it's something. Anyhow, we don't go home empty-handed. They put you in jail for smuggling opium, Captain Nares. Jails aren't pleasant. I'm not a boy, Mr. Maverick. There are ways of getting this stuff in. I'm sure there are. And I'm just as sure you know all of them, and could think up a few new ones. But just the same, I chartered your ship... ...and I don't intend to spend several years in a federal prison for smuggling dope. A joke is a joke, Maverick, and this is no time for it. Well, if the risks don't bother you, I can come up with a few personal objections. You're talking about right and wrong. Tell your men to dump it overboard. No. There's a handy profit to be made in this stuff. A nice sum for each of us. I made this run on a percentage and so did my men. Now, we are poor men, Mr. Maverick. Following the sea is a hard life... ...and we made a long run here at the Midway... ...and, uh, you wouldn't want to see us, uh, go back poor men, would you? I like money too, Captain Nares... ...but not this kind. Oh, be reasonable. Even if I agreed with you, my men would not like it. So let's stop the argument. He's got a gun, captain. Yeah, and I judge he knows how to handle it. Up with your hands. Now, you tie him up good and tight and we drop him in deep water. Pick it up. Tell your men to stand back. Stand back. You in the hold, come on up. Put your hands up. BART: In here. Why did you do it? You could have killed me, you didn't. All right, men, throw your knives down into the hold. Now, turn around. Put your hands on top of your heads. On top. Maverick, you forgot one thing. How are you going to get away? You can't sail the Nora Karina without me and my crew. You ought to think of one other thing. Mr. Higgins there, he paid me to come to you and get him aboard. Now, he's double-crossed me and he'll do the same to you. I don't think so, captain. You fools! That's money you're heaving over the side. Money! You better never let me come across your bows again... ...either of you... ...because I will slice you up into pieces too small for bait. You know, Maverick, Nares is right. We can't sail the Nora Karina by ourselves. We'd have to set them loose. We might as well cut our own throats and save time. What chance do we have if we keep watch on them? Well, we'd need fine weather every mile of the way. That's impossible. The first sign of bad weather and we'd need them and they wouldn't need us. Afraid you're right. We'd have to take turns sleeping. That would leave only one of us to watch seven. I'd rather draw to an inside straight and play it blind. There is one other way. One of the small boats. That's a big ocean, Mr. Dickson. It will get bigger too. We could rig a sail and load up with food and water. At least we'd stand a chance that way. We'd be in the trade lanes. - That the only way? - Afraid so. What about Nares and his men? They'll get a little hungry before they get loose. But we'll have a long start. That's it, then. One of the small boats. I expect you know we may never be picked up. That's the case, there'll be something on my tombstone I never expected. "Bart Maverick, died at sea." [CHUCKLES] In three days you'll be bait, if you last that long. Now, listen to reason. I give you my word. I'll take the ocean, Captain Nares. Well, what do you think? I think we've probably drifted out of the trade lanes. You wanna tell me about it now? Might help at a time like this. You could have taken this while I was sleeping. Uh-huh. But you could have dumped it overboard anytime. - Why didn't you? - Morbid curiosity, I expect. I wanted to read it all. I've only read part of it. What would I have seen it? My name isn't Dickson. It's Paul Carthew. I... I was a remittance man in New Zealand. Is that log the only reason you went after the Flying Scudd? Not the opium? There was murder aboard that ship, terrible murder... ...and I was part of it. A year ago I joined up with some pearl fishers in the Dutch indies. We'd made quite a haul when a Dutch cutter gave chase. We lost them in the fog but we cracked up on a reef. We took to a small boat. We managed to get to Midway and light a signal fire. Three days later, the Flying Scudd saw our signal and picked us up. Captain Wicks and his crew found out about the pearls we had. They wanted their share. They wanted all of it. My share alone was worth over 10,000 guineas. A fight started... ...and I was hit across the head. When I regained consciousness, the Flying Scudd was like a slaughterhouse. - Captain Wicks and his crew were... - Murdered? But I swear, I had nothing to do with it. I didn't even know until... But I had to go along with them. We ran the Flying Scudd onto a reef and a British man-of-war picked us up. You and the others pretended to be Captain Wicks and his crew? Yes, that's why I had to go back and get this log. - Why didn't you take it with you then? - I thought I had. I took the captain's log... ...and when I read it, I found the mate had kept another one. This one. It has everything in it. How the Flying Scudd picked us up, and the pearls... All our names listed in it. Didn't you think of telling your story to the law? A captain of a ship, dead by violence. We'd have all been hunted down and hanged. So when you got back to San Francisco you reported the Flying Scudd as beached. Then you dropped out of sight. I had money from the sale of the pearls to buy the Flying Scudd... ...and get to her and burn her into the sea. Wipe out that terrible... I swear, I swear by all that's holy, I killed no one. Even my friends are innocent in a manner of speaking. They didn't start the fight. Well, whatever it's worth, I believe you. It's worth a great deal, Bart. Thank you. - What? - Here, Paul, take some water. Better? - I'm sorry, Bart. - Sorry? Why? Maybe I deserve to die like this. Had it coming, I expect. But not you. Don't let it worry you. - As a matter of fact-- - But it does worry me. If I'd made a clean breast of things when you came to me in San Francisco... ...if I'd told you then, you wouldn't be here now. Believe me, I'd do anything to make it up to you. But it's too late. Your intentions are good anyway, at least at the moment. If things were different, I swear I'd make it up to you. Somehow, someway. You don't think we have a chance? Not now. Well, I'm just wondering about my brother. He's up to his neck in debts. If the Flying Scudd was worth what we paid for... ...you could still claim her and salvage something out of the mess. But she isn't worth it. And I hope you'll forgive me for what I did to your brother and to you. You, uh, said you'd make it up to me. How? Oh, there's no sense in talking about it, Bart. We're a couple of dead men and we both know it. Well, maybe you're right but it's a way to pass the time. What, uh, would you do if you could? I've got $50,000 in the bank in San Francisco. I'd give every nickel of it. Twenty-five thousand is enough. We're a couple of fools, Bart, talking like this. Well, maybe, but what else have we got to do? Got a pencil? I feel like dying a rich man. Make out a draft for 25,000 payable to Bret and Bart Maverick. Looks like you broke first, Bart. Why not 50,000? You stand as much chance of cashing it. Twenty-five thousand is plenty. We'll both be the wealthiest corpses in this part of the Pacific Ocean. How many more days to Midway, Mr. Hanson? Yesterday, it was five. So today, it should be four. But maybe not. The captain has altered course to pick up survivors. Survivors? Small boat just off there. I thought you said this was a big ocean, Mr. Hanson. You know of a bigger one? Well, after we pick up our survivors... ...unless the captain has got another reason for stopping at Midway... ...you can tell him to forget it. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Before you give it to me... ...look over your right shoulder. How long have you known that boat was back there? Just long enough. Paul. [English - US - SDH]
