 Maverick (1957–1962): Season 1, Episode 10 - The Jeweled Gun - full transcript 
 Bart doesn't like being employed at all, but accompanying a beautiful, moneyed widow on a stagecoach apparently wasn't ruled out by Pappy. Though they are traveling North from Old Santa Fe through badlands, the coach's heating up. The closer they get to Laramie, the more Bart wants to combine business & pleasure. Are those danger signs he's ignoring from not-so-demure Daisy? Is protecting her making Bart love-blind and vulnerable ? Which is the real danger: varmints he's been hired to protect her against - or her jeweled gun?

 This is a grave in the town of La Mesa, New Mexico. There are many strange things about this grave... the strangest of which is this: No one is buried here. Well, here we are. And about time too. If we take a north trail, we ought to be in Clayton in about four days. Ugh, Clayton? Oh, if we take the south trail, we'll be Santa Fe by tomorrow. They tell me th... Oh, I remember now. Adelaide. She lives in Clayton. She does?

 - That's quite a coincidence, isn't it? - Uh-huh. Well, give her my best. Are you sure you don't want to come? Not even if she had a sister. Well, remember what Pappy told us. Never hold a kicker. Heh, never draw to an inside straight. - Take care of yourself, Bart. - Ride easy, brother Bret. Santa Fe, the oldest capital in the country. That's what the sign said at the edge of town. I'd been in a lot of western towns but none like this one. It was a new kind of place to me, mostly Spanish... with only a touch of America here and there. I liked it. I decided to spend my first day just looking and listening. Oh, there you are.

 Pretend to know me, please. That won't be difficult. I was just going to fix my tie. If you'd do it, it might be a nice touch. All right. Those men behind me... have been following me for over 10 minutes. Maybe it's a local custom. Why don't we step over here and see what happens? Ugh, thank you. I've never been so frightened. I think they were just trying to be polite. Oh. You a stranger to this part of the country? Yes. Yes, I am. I just arrived this morning. Maybe we could look at it together. Heh, well, I think that would be very nice. Thank you. My name is Bart Maverick. How do you do, Bart Maverick? Oh, thank you, Mr. Maverick. It was a most beautiful afternoon. - Does it end here? - I'm afraid it does. My carriage is in that stable across the street. I don't even know your name. No, you don't. - I gather you intend keeping it that way. - I'm afraid I do. It's gonna make a little harder for me to find you next time. - Maybe, I'd rather find you. - Heh. Heh, where are you staying? The Barker House. It's not the best hotel in town but they do have the best poker game. - Are you a gambler by chance? - No, on purpose. The Barker House. Thanks again and goodbye. - Señor Maverick? - Yes. My name is Henrique Fillipe, señor. I am an attorney. May I come in? I understand you spent the afternoon with a client of mine. Well, that may be. What's your client's name? Miss Daisy Harris. - Sounds likely, she didn't tell me. - No. She's wealthy, therefore, cautious... but, uh, you made a most favorable impression on her. - The impression was mutual. - Oh, I may have misled you. She was impressed in connection with a job... that she has been looking to fill. - Job? - Yes. A simple job, and one that might be rather pleasant. It pays $500 for just a few weeks work. - Doing what, Mr. Fillipe? - You are interested? Uh, curious. I'd have to know a lot more before I was interested. Miss Harris has some rather important business... to transact in Laramie, Wyoming. The trip is dangerous, she doesn't want to make it alone... nor under her own name. She would like to travel under an assumed name... and with, uh, shall we say, an assumed husband. She would like you to play that role. Your client is full of surprises, Mr. Fillipe. Thank her and tell her I'd do it, but I just hate long rides in stage coaches. - You are refusing? - I'm afraid so. She will ask me why? I never bet into a blind hand... but she probably wouldn't know what that meant. So tell her I'm flattered but I'm just not looking for a job right now. Why don't you take it? I have a very busy practice here, señor. I am also a rancher. I have a place just north of town. Otherwise, I would be most happy to do it for her. I'm afraid Miss Harris is gonna be quite disappointed. She was under the impression you liked her... and that you had no special business that might keep you in Santa Fe. For some strange reason, the job doesn't appeal to me, Mr. Fillipe. Try to make her understand, will you? You do not like being employed by a woman? I don't like being employed. Well, I'll do my best to make her understand, señor. Good night. Mr. Maverick. Good evening. Well... Good evening, Miss Harris. You like this hotel or do you play poker too? I was hoping I'd see you. Would you come in? Are you surprised to find that we're neighbors? I can't believe that we are. Won't you sit down, please? My attorney tells me that you were rude to him today. May have looked like that. I just said no. I wish you'd reconsider. You won't have any trouble finding someone, Daisy. - Otherwise, I might have said yes. - I want you, Mr. Maverick. - Well, I feel so safe with you. - You do? Oh, I didn't mean it that way. It's just the trip from here to Laramie is dangerous. There are Indians, highwaymen. If you run into either, I doubt if I'd be much help. I think you would be. Why don't you wanna travel under your own name? I can't tell you that, not just now. There's a great deal of money at stake at what I have to do. Thanks for the brandy. - You didn't touch it. - I never drink after sundown. Good night. Don't go, please. If the price isn't high enough, I'll make it $1000. - Heh, in cash, right now? - Yes. I am tempted to take you up on it just to find out what it's all about. But I've got a thousand dollars, Daisy. I guess I'll never know. How long has Miss Harris been here at the hotel? - Just checked in this evening, sir. - Oh. - Do you know anything about her? - No. - You know who she is? - I'm working on it. - Who is it? - Your neighbor. - Is that offer still open? - Yes. I'll take it, on one very small condition. You pay me half the money now. Agreed. But don't play all night, Mr. Maverick, we'll be leaving early in the morning. Oh, no, we won't. I checked, the stage coach doesn't leave until noon. But we won't be leaving from town. Since we'll be travelling as husband and wife... my attorney will have the stage coach pick us up at his ranch... north of town. I'll be ready whenever you are, Daisy. Good night. Heh, well, I was sure I'd have to get you out of bed. Well, you would have had I gone to bed. - Daisy, ugh... - Hmm? Daisy, I think you're wonderful. But do you think I could get out of this for, say, $1000? Cold cash, right now. - One hundred percent profit. - Oh. Do you know, Bart, if I were a vain woman, you'd have me in tears. The answer is no. You cannot get out of it. Just thought I'd ask. Ho! Ho! Howdy, Mr. Fillipe. These are Mr. and Mrs. John Haskell... going all the way to Laramie with you. It's a long trip and we're late. Hop aboard. FILLIPE: John. John, it's been a wonderful visit. I hope you'll come again, Mrs. Haskell. Our door is always open to you and your husband. Thank you, señor. Oh, John. I don't think you'll see any Indians but you might as well be prepared. I'd like you to have this. - I've got my own... - Please, I insist. You will be going through Comanche territory. The best, a Winchester. The same cartridge as your revolver. - Let's get going, folks. - Thanks. Yes, sir. And I expect to sell enough all by myself... to stretch from here to Shanghai. That's just about the right place to stretch it, mister, from here to Shanghai. It's got no business on good grazing land. - Cattlemen, sir. - I am. What is barbed wire? It's an invention to kill off cattle, ma'am, either by starvation or tearing them to bits. Ain't that right, sir? I never argue about politics of barbed wire. Heh, Well, there's no argument in barbed wire. It takes up no room, exhausts no soil, shades no vegetation... it's proof against high winds, is durable, cheap and makes no snow drifts. It don't snow in New Mexico. How about you, sir? Are you a salesman too? Uh, yes, I'm a salesman, but, uh, I don't sell barbed wire. Uh-huh. What do you sell? The Book of Knowledge. You're all right then. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Is something wrong, we're going faster? We're in Comanche country, ma'am. These flats are likely spots for them... so the driver gets through here at a pretty good clip. Worried, Mr. Fence Salesman? - No, of course not. - You should be. Uh, according to our latest edition, the Indians hereabouts are peaceful. Maybe they haven't read your latest edition. Hyah! - Good evening, Mrs. Haskell. Heh. - Good evening, Mr. Haskell. Shall we dine? - Do you think this will be comfortable? - No. Oh, then maybe I should let you have the bed. Oh, I wouldn't think of letting you do a thing like that, Daisy... - but I will cut you for it. - Oh, no, you won't. - These look a little too real for comfort. - They are real. - Take them off. - Why? Out here, the thieves outnumber the law 10 to 1... and you're much too much a temptation without wearing those. Take them off. Well, I will not. Thank you, Mrs. Haskell. You're welcome, John. Do you have a gun? No. Why? I'll get you one. - I can't be with you every minute. - Oh, I don't want a gun. If you gave me one, I wouldn't know how to use it. Besides, you will be with me every minute. Excuse me for staring at you, but don't we know each other? No, I don't think so. My wife and I are strangers in these parts. So am I. My name is Mitchell. What's yours? Uh, John Haskell. Aren't you sure? We're newlyweds. I'm still a little confused. Newlyweds? I thought you said you'd been married for five years, ma'am? We have, but we still consider ourselves newlyweds. I think I've got it. Where we met, I mean. Wasn't it in a poker game? You play poker, Mr. Hallock? Haskell. No, I don't play poker. Whist. Play a crackerjack game of whist. Well, I'll get it. I never forget a face. Leastways I don't like to. What's your line of work, sir? - Guns. - Oh, you sell guns? No. Hyah! Hyah! Yes, ma'am, some more of that Comanche country. We'll be going pretty fast for a while now. Hyah! - What's the matter? - Some dust in that draw back there. Still not worried? No. Is it still there? It's getting bigger. It's either Indians or... It's Indians. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! I've got it. It was in Dodge City and it was in a poker game. He's dead. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Looks like they've had enough. He's dead all right. Now I know why you ain't afraid of Indians. You see, I did pick the right man. I'd have resigned but there didn't seem to be any place to go. Daisy, if you're heading for the tub, you'll have to argue with me. I paid the boy to heat some water. That was nice of you. I'll make good use of it. After me. - Before you. - No, Daisy. This time, we do cut for it. High man gets the tub first. That's a very high card. It'll be hard to beat. Heh, what do you know, a tie. What happened to our friend, the fence salesman? I thought he was going on to La Mesa? That's my part of the country, La Mesa. - Who is it? MAN: Manager, missus. Well, Mrs. Haskell, ain't you glad to see me? Snopes, remember, how I used to work for you and your husband? What do you want? I think you better let me come in, Mrs. Haskell. It certainly is nice to see you again, Mrs. Haskell. You know, I'm not a groom anymore. I got me own stables right here in town. - What do you want? - Oh, just curious. Wondering why a man should sign the register John Haskell... when he ain't Mr. John Haskell at all. I don't mean you no harm, Mrs. Haskell. You know I always liked you. Of course. Is there something I can do for you, Mr. Snopes? That's better, and there is something you could do for me. What, with a new business and all, I could use a little money. How much, Mr. Snopes? Hundred dollars, Mrs. Haskell. I think I can spare that much. Better make it 200, Mrs. Haskell. And then another 200 after that, Mr. Snopes? Then four, then eight, is that the way it would be? I ain't greedy, Mrs. Haskell. Oh, but I'm afraid you are. Don't, missus. It was just a joke. That's all. Just a joke. We're sure sorry, Mrs. Haskell... that a thing like this could happen in our town. I just wish there was something I could do to make up for it. Thank you, sheriff. You already have, by your kindness. You have a brave little wife, Mr. Haskell. Thank you, sheriff. And, ma'am, if there's anything I can do... - I sure hope you'll let me know. - I will, sheriff. I will. Um... - Good night. - Good night. You think the sheriff believed your story, Daisy? Of course he did. Why shouldn't he? I can think of a lot of reasons why he shouldn't, but he did. It happened just the way I said. He was a groom in my family stables in Philadelphia... - and he did know about the jewels. - All right. But he was sure careless. First getting caught, then getting shot while he was holding a gun. He didn't expect me to have one. Come to think of it, neither did I. Aren't you the girl that said you wouldn't know how to use a gun? You did just fine on Snopes. I trust you, Bart... but I don't trust anyone in the world a hundred percent. I had a gun and I knew exactly how to use it. I saw no reason to tell you that. Fair enough, Daisy... but this is as far as I go... unless you are ready to answer some questions, quite a few of them. Don't you have any compassion at all? Doesn't it mean anything to you what I've just gone through? I'm sorry, Daisy, but I still have to know. I have to know why I am here, why we're traveling as husband and wife? Not now, Bart. Look, our next stop will be La Mesa. Can you wait until then? When we get to La Mesa, I'll tell you everything you wanna know. All right, Daisy. I'll wait till then. Thank you. Haven't you put if off for about as long as you can, Daisy? You ready with the answers? Yes, I am. Don't you move or I'll kill you. I believe you. Is the stage all set? Now you kill me, is that it, Daisy? I'm doing this because I have to. My life depends on it... and the life of the man I love. Don't tell me your troubles, Daisy. I've got troubles of my own. Open. Open up. Open up! - What's wrong, Mrs. Haskell? - A man, he shot my husband. He went through the window. Get the doctor. He's upstairs. Find the sheriff and round up some men. - Mrs. Adams, will you take care of her? - Oh, you poor dear. Get some brandy, Fred. Hurry! You poor dear. You poor dear. Hurry, Fred! Oh, no. - Oh, you poor dear. - Here's the brandy. Here's the brandy. Here. Take this. This will make you feel better. You poor dear. What's happened? In there, doctor. Oh, you poor dear. There's nothing you can do for him. Take care of her. She's the wife. - May I take her in there? - Yes, come in, doc. Sheriff. In here. Mrs. Haskell, is this the way he came in to the room too... or did he just use that window to go out? He came in that way too, I opened the window to air out the room. - Don't you think...? - If you interrupt again... I'm going to have to ask you to leave. - I was just going to say... - I'm sure you know... that I don't enjoy asking questions at a time like this. It's all right, sheriff. I want to cooperate in any way I can. Good. Now then, what kind of a gun did he use? I don't know. You see, I know nothing about guns. I don't like to mention this but... Well, the undertaker told me that the bullets were .41 caliber. The only gun I know that uses .41 caliber bullets is a Derringer. Oh. He... He must have used my gun. Your gun, ma'am? A Derringer. The holdup man took it because it was very valuable. The handle was encrusted with jewels. It was then that my husband made a jump for him... the holdup man shot him twice and he... Well, he must have used the Derringer to do it with. It has just two shots in it. I see. And he took the gun with him? Yes. Yes, he did, along with the jewelry. Is this your Winchester, ma'am? No. No, that belonged to my husband. Sure I can dissuade the widow from paying her last respects. But even if I can... that's no real problem. Might be a little scary, but only for a while. Heh, I'll get you out before we bury it. Well, I appreciate that. Still hurt? I guess I should have taken out some of the powder too. She almost burned me to death. Maverick, I don't know if I can go along with this anymore. I just found out that she sent a telegram to her attorney last night. She don't want a funeral till he gets here. When will that be? Tomorrow afternoon, late. The only place I can be sure I won't lose her is in jail. I can't put here there unless I bring a charge against her. If you let her find out I'm still alive, we'll never get the answer. It's important to me to find out where I fit in this puzzle... but seems like it ought to be even more important to you. Attempted murder is the only crime I know was committed. I ought to arrest her. Sheriff, with Daisy on the stand... any jury of cowboys will decide that was no crime at all. She's murdered one man that I know of... maybe another that I don't know of. If we don't do it my way, we're never going to find out. Yeah, I guess you're right. And you were right too about that carbine, I checked it. The jewels and the Derringer were in the stock. Where was she when you...? - Don't worry. She was across the hall with her friend, Mrs. Adams. - Good afternoon, sheriff. - Ma'am. - Mr. Carter, I came... - I've already told him, Mrs. Haskell... uh, about the delay. Oh, thank you very much. Will it be all right to wait? My attorney should be here by tomorrow afternoon. Anything you say, Mrs. Haskell. Oh, thank you. Good day, gentlemen. They're coming, get in quick. Now... whatever you do, don't sweat. Well, that's a fine thing to tell a man, don't sweat. Now, close your eyes. You look fine. Hold it. Stop breathing. Here they are. I'm sorry, Mr. Carter... I think I'd rather remember him as he was. Of course, Mrs. Haskell. Uh, would you and Mr. Fillipe care to join the others? I'll be with you shortly. Don't sweat. John Haskell was buried on a late Wednesday afternoon... of May, 1876. Anyway, that was the general impression. The widow and her attorney gave memorable performances... in spite of the fact that the audience was rather small. Henry, pour me a drink. Daisy, it's all over now, we are safe. - Stop worrying about me, I'm all right. - You're not all right. You've been getting more tense by the hour. And why not? Do you know what I've been through? Why? Why did we do it? You make it sound as though I shot your husband on purpose. You think I wanted to kill him? - He was trying to kill me. - I know. I know, I'm sorry. It's just that I'm so frightened. I'm here now, querida amiga, there's nothing to be frightened about. It's all over now, we're safe. I keep having nightmares. Nightmares of his being found, of people coming to arrest me. The day you left, I dropped a half a ton of rock into the mineshaft. Your husband will never be found, will you believe that now? As far as the world is concerned, Haskell was shot... and buried right here in La Mesa and that's the end of it. There will be no one coming to arrest either of us, querida. You're right, Henry. There isn't anything for us to be afraid of. We did just what we planned... and it's worked out just the way we planned it. My love. Sheriff, I... Sorry, ma'am. I think the widow is ready to tell you the whole story now. And if she doesn't, you tell the sheriff in Santa Fe... that her husband's body is in an old mineshaft in the lawyer's ranch. When Daisy recovered, she made a full and complete confession. And next morning, the sheriff was ready to take them back to Santa Fe. Hyah! For me, that was the end of the story of the late John Haskell... and of Daisy. Hey, Haskell. I didn't expect to find you still in town. - I'm taking the stage tomorrow. - Where's Mrs. Haskell? We quarreled. The next day I bought a seat on the northbound stage. Laramie sounded like a nice town. And it was a long distance from Santa Fe. - Hello, brother Bart. - Bret. I thought you went south. - What happened to Adelaide? - Well, it's a long story. Heh, so is mine. Uh, I think maybe you better tell me yours first. Hyah!
