 Jannat. You're misleading Nusrat. I need him. So you can dispose him off later? Not again, Kabir. I won't let it. There's a small issue, sir. There's been a murder. The victim was run over by a car, and he was a Talibani. What evidence do you have that he was from the Taliban? - But sir... - The Taliban are not in Kech. Stop spreading rumors. They are just absconding criminals.

 So what are our orders, sir? How far did that shopkeeper follow that lady? Till Jaan Maidan, sir. The vehicle has been traced. - We have the exact location, sir. - It's a gang of three people. We've been keeping an eye on them. Your orders are to go to Jaan Maidan and take as many men as you can with you. Yes, sir. Can this be linked to those Indian Agents? This can be a secret operation by the Indians. Impossible. Only one man could pull off something like this, and he's dead. Sadiq Sheikh. Salim, gather every man we have.

 Asraf, get in the vehicle. Hurry up. Even if they're Indians, they'll never make it beyond Quetta. Kech is out of the question. How can you be so sure? Indians will never make the mistake of sending a female on such a critical mission. I will shoot. You... Don't... try my patience. Do what you like. But I won't make the call. He's just... playing with your mind. I trust Sadiq Sir's choice. You're making a big mistake. You've no idea. He's an imposter. - Please give me the masking code. - No. No. - No. - Won't you? You won't. Quiet. Stop. Don't even think about it. Take him inside. He's unconscious. And get out of here. This place is dangerous. Who are you? Didn't he tell you who I am? He's taking you for a ride too. Beware... or you'll regret it. Why me? Sir. Why did you do this to me? Tell me. Who was that woman? What woman? I trusted you. Now you will follow my orders. Call the agency. I will... but that won't do you any good. The agency has long forgotten you. You have no handler. No one even read your reports. Who are you going to call? You think the agency sent that message about your father, because they are worried for you? What message? Allow me. My father has Alzheimer's. By the time I reach home, he might even forget my face. Do you get that? Do you? Sadiq Sheikh was like a father to me. He was murdered... and there was nothing the agency could do. Your courage is commendable. You are tied to a chair and yet can't help lying. Sadiq Sheikh is dead. The agency doesn't care about its agents. Not even a bit. That's why I came to rescue them. On an unsanctioned mission. Another lie. I told you I will shoot. I will shoot. Just answer my questions. Okay? Mullah Khalid is in Kech. Just break this news out, and you will return home as a hero. I like being a hero... but I don't trust you. Who was she? Who was that woman? - Jannat. - Jannat who? She was saying that there's danger. What's going on here? Fine... I have decided. I won't kill you. I'll let them do the dirty work for me. - Veer. - Veer, you can kill me later. But we must rescue the agents first. I never break someone's trust. But I want answers. Take him out through the back door. We'll meet in the old ruins at the back. Sister. Where were you? I was over at Shehnaz's place. Her son is ill. You are lying. Nusrat, you're my younger brother. Don't try to be my father. - I am just looking out for you and Qasim. - And, I for you, Nusrat. I saw him leaving your camp and just followed him. Don't try to teach me, sister. A married woman meeting a stranger at this late hour, is destined for punishment on doomsday. I taught you to read the Quran... and now you're teaching me the definition of doomsday. - Our father... - He's dead. We're the only ones left. So be honest with me, sister. I wanted to see him once. Have you responded to the video? Yes, sir. I requested them to keep the agents alive. Stated bureaucratic hassles and requested some time to convince High Command, to cite some official policy. Any update about the asset? Veer Singh hasn't responded yet. But the message should have cleared the situation for him. What did Isha say exactly? Sir, they are rescuing the prisoners. Did you block her access? Yes, sir. Did you trace them in Balochistan? Sir, it's weird. If the Taliban has our agents, then Isha and Kabir should be in Quetta. The trace I got is from Kech. Who is Jannat? Bashir Marri's daughter. Bashir Marri? Balochistan's Yasir Arafat. He died a few years ago. ISA killed him. How do you know her? Is she trustworthy? If she wasn't, then I wouldn't still be alive. We cannot afford more trouble right now. You created this mess. Now you two decide what we do next. What were you arguing with Nusrat about? His goals and my concerns. Shouldn't I be a part of these discussions? I am your husband, Jannat. Don't you believe that I should be the leader of BAF instead? Qasim... Let's not start again. I know what BAF should be. We must unite everyone. And everyone believes that I am incapable. Politics is all about knowing the possible and the impossible. And you're weak. What woman trusts her brother's capabilities over her own husband. A woman that loves her country. I just came here to ask for help. How dare you barge into my home? You have no right. I had no choice. You're the only one I can trust right now. What do you want? Take a right here. Jannat said this is the safest place to hide. Stop here. This is our chance. The country we are doing it for has long forgotten us. Words of a man afraid of dying. We serve the country, not the other way round. Come. - Brother. - What? We have a message for Amir-ul-Mu'uminin. Can we convey it to you? Go ahead. Can you relay the message directly to him? Or send someone else who is capable of it? I would never lie to you. The situation was out of my control. I don't trust you. Jannat, I loved you. And only you. Not a day went by... Don't dig up old graves. I have to. If I have to bury my past... I need your help. Taliban has made its way here. Mullah Khalid is hiding here. That's impossible. Because I would know. Mullah Khalid is in Kech. And no one has a clue. You can stop worrying about Balochistan. We'll handle that. Don't vent your anger on your motherland, Jannat. The Taliban has captured my agents. And I am here to rescue them. And that's not possible without the support of BAF. Are you completely out of touch? What did you think? BAF isn't what it used to be. Nusrat... is still a kid. You guys give us weapons and funding whenever it's convenient for you. Everyone's fighting amongst themselves. Those old values died with my father. I am sorry for your loss. I really am. But give me one more chance. I will fix everything. For Nusrat, for BAF, and for Balochistan. I have a plan. Hurry up with whatever it is. - Do it. - Shoot, dammit. - Shoot! Do it now! - We don't have time. Come on, shoot. Shoot. Come on, shoot. Bastards... trying to run! Scoundrel! Beat them. Scoundrel! Bastards. Infidel. Rascal. Teach them a lesson. What lesson can an infidel like you teach us? Take your revenge. Revenge is only for the brave. And this kid isn't capable of anything. Death will be a mercy for you. Don't forget this restlessness. You'll be within an inch of your life, but I won't let you die. Rascals. What do you want, Isha? Nihar, open the damn network. I need clearance from Joshi. Get clearance later. Joshi needs to talk to Kabir. There are developments that I cannot talk about. Lives are at stake. The network is on, Kabir. They want to talk. Sir. Why don't you talk to them? We should tell them the truth. What's the problem? Frankly Veer, Mullah's presence in Kech is my assessment. And without evidence, we won't get anywhere. Something's not right between the Taliban and ISA. And we need to take advantage of this. But how are we going to do it? If Mullah's being kept here, in such close proximity of Gwadar... then definitely his hands are tied. There are two things that have been bugging me. Why hasn't Mullah beheaded the agents yet? And why is he negotiating? Because if they had beheaded them, they would've made a video of it. Posted on the internet for the world to see. And that would've increased the chances of exposing Mullah's location. Logically, Mullah should have handed over the agents to ISA. They're experts in such situations. - They haven't. - Correct. What are they planning for the agents? They will kill them... When the time is right. Fuck! Indo-China Summit is in a week. I want details of all the pipelines that lead to Gwadar. What is your intelligence? From Gwadar these pipelines go all the way to Kalat. And the ISA control points in this 800-kilometer stretch keeps multiplying. Pressure changes, to... fuel-flow alterations, are all controlled at these points. We take the pipeline, but in a controlled way. And what good will that do? In order to win wars, we must first win hearts, Veer. We cannot defeat the Taliban without the BAF's support. The ISA has a signal post 30 miles from here. Mullah's hiding place will be a closed structure. Big enough for at least 100 people to hide out there. An attack if done well, will give us at least 3 hours. We'll wait for the Taliban to move. With BAF support, it will be easier to spot their movement, as well as our agents. It's a risky plan, sir. Sir, why did you come to Kech last time? Five years ago, near Gwadar... an Indian Diplomat by the name of Karan Bhushan passed away. Bhushan was an IIW agent who was embedded in foreign services from the beginning. He was on a mission. The death was reported as accidental. Accidents do happen. But not to a spy, in a bathtub. Sadiq Sir wanted to get to the bottom of this. Get in touch with all our underground sources. If it was a murder, we need evidence. And if it wasn't, we still need evidence. What is the classification of this mission? Top Secret. Non-Combat. High-priority research mission. My cover was that of a journalist. Vikramjeet had arrived beforehand. Assuming the identity of a construction contractor from Peshawar. The fractured politics of Balochistan had already claimed many lives. I had a list of assets, and the cover of a reporter. But I needed more to gain access. How long has your husband been missing? I can help you. Where do you live? Journalists like you are like parasites. Keep your help to yourself. We may be parasites, but we know how to choose our host. Reporter Shoaib Rafiq. You can Google me. Jannat knew that reporters don't have any sympathy for Balochistan. And she thought I would make the world aware of Balochistan's situation. Thank you. Thank you. I have read extensively about your family. I admire your father, Mr. Bashir Marri, to stare adversity in its face and fight it unflinchingly. By the way, do you have any clue what adversity is? "Sweet are the uses of adversity, which like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in its head." Shakespeare! My mother used to teach Shakespeare in school. What are you really doing in Balochistan? I mean, there are other conflict-ridden areas in the world. You can go there and show them your sympathy. You might even win the next Pulitzer. My mother divorced my father and married someone from Quetta. I stayed with him. He was a better man than my father. I learned a lot from him about Balochistan. I can show you around Balochistan if that's of any help. I'd love that. The women of this country were low on everybody's priority list. I gave her hope. She thought I'd be useful to her. Thanks to Jannat's connections it became much easier... for me to contact my asset network. I could talk to many Indian assets freely. Weeks passed. No lead yet. Karan Bhushan's death was a big mystery for us. Sadiq Sir was worried. I had written so many articles, that I began to forget that I was a spy. And not a journalist. I would actually like you to come and see my artwork. I yearn for an audience in Balochistan. It's obvious. Art cannot resolve conflicts. Yeah... but who's going to explain that to an artist. Mother used to get these illustrated books of Shakespeare for me. I miss those. You can take these. Sister, where is my bat? I don't know. That's my brother, Nusrat. - Say hello. - Hello. Hello. You didn't catch the ball. - Out. - You didn't catch the ball. - I caught it. - You didn't. Go! "This time she was welcome wholeheartedly. And taken to Olivia's chamber at once. I..." Do you like it? Okay... I have something else I want to show you. Come on. What's here? Nothing. No one. Just you and me. - Hi, Kabir. - Hello. I thought you'll call only during an emergency. It is an emergency. I need your help. What is it, Kabir? Is Vikram all right? No. Vikram is fine. He's fine. Listen, I wanted to talk to you. I lied to someone. - I... - Have you met someone? "Of all the gin joints in all the towns in the world, she walks into mine." - You are quoting Casablanca. - How cheesy, Kabir? Two things. Firstly, you crashed into her world. Secondly, gin joints are sacrilegious, in your part of the world. Kabir. Do what you like. But just don't lie to her. It will break her heart. Take care of yourself, and my husband too. Okay, you take care. Bye. What's up? Nothing. Two months had passed, but we still hadn't made any progress. Father wants to meet you. When can you come over? How about tomorrow? Promise? Promise. My editor wants me to meet this businessman. I'll get done and call you? Sure. Right. - Bye. - Bye. Are you out of your freaking mind? We haven't made any progress and you're busy running around trees. The hit on Bhushan was ordered from Delhi. He had learned about the Pakistani Naval Base in Gwadar... which the Chinese are building. That's a valid point. Sounds like a motive enough for murder. But we'll need evidence to prove the links in India. We cannot sing a song to Sadiq sir. We'll need solid evidence. Yes. After a few months, we found proof. What happened? I think I have proof. What are you saying? We are meeting him today. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Please spare his life. He is Asad. His father forced his brother Afzal to join the Taliban. Afzal has escaped from Quetta and wants to defect. Islam doesn't teach us to shed blood or to be a paedophile. How can they call themselves Taliban? Please save my brother. It's not our job to help defectors cross over. He has information. And it's so huge that the Americans are ready... to give safe haven to him and his entire family. He has information about Bhushan's death. What information? When, why, and how. He has all the information. Don't mind me but, a closed fist is worth millions... If you can help him get to the Americans, then... What's your assessment? Sounds desperate. Does look genuine. Your call. He's your guy. - Let's do it. - Okay. Fine. - We'll take him to the US base. - Thanks. - And also debrief him on the way. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. These Americans want everything served to them on a plate. You want me to talk to the Americans all on the basis of this hunch. - Are you two out of your minds? - He has information. Trust me, sir. Look, this remains a research mission. Understand? Yes, sir. No engaging targets. No guns. Done, sir. We just pick him up and hand him over to the Americans. As simple as that. Okay, fine. Keep me posted. Yes, sir. Don't be scared. He doesn't bite. Come on, let's go. He's waiting. Jannat made sure your coffee is just the way you like it. Black. No sugar. Father, please. I guess sleep is a luxury in your profession. Be it day or night. Rest is crucial for a journalist. And for you, it's a matter of life and death. Right? This book is important in war. Be it a battlefield or just an argument. I am sure you have read it. The Art of War. I don't... Appear weak when you are strong. And strong when you are weak. Young man. And right now I can see you are weak. Please spare him, father. This is his first time here. Are you going to tell Jannat the truth... or do I? I'm an Indian. An Indian what? An Indian spy. Dear... the illness and the cure are at your disposal. Carefully plan your next move. Your father is with you in every decision. I couldn't tell her the mission details... nor about the mission. I tried to explain to her without disclosing any information. She thought I used her. All I needed was two days. Just two more days, Jannat. And I will quit. I'll do whatever it takes to be with you. First, you said he'll meet at his home now you're saying he'll meet us at the madrasa The Taliban have raided his home. They are after him. He's scared and hiding in this empty madrasa. Do I smell something fishy...? Let's do this right, and then it's back home. I'm expecting a kid, and you're missing home. - Let's do it. - Let's think, do we have to do this? Wait. Remember this is a non-combat mission. He must be somewhere inside. You look that way, and I'll check here. Kabir, leave! Don't come any closer. Get out. Don't just stand there. This is not an option. The bomb can go off any minute. Shut up, there is no way I am leaving you alone. Let me think. We could match the pressure somehow. I'll come up with something. Stop being absurd. This is no time to cite something like "Even Death won't do us apart"! - There is no way I am leaving you alone. - At least one of us will leave alive. Think about Neeta. Think about Sadiq Sir. Get out. Run! Leave! Get out. Run! Sadiq sir extracted me with the help of the Americans. It was a trap all along. No one knew who did it or why. I lost a dear friend, but Adonis is the one who died. For good. I also lost Jannat. Neeta and Sikander are paying for my mistakes. It was all my fault. You are repeating your mistakes. You hid everything from us so you don't get blamed for our deaths. We can still trust you. But can you trust me, and Isha? Stop the car. I have news. There will be an attack on ISA's third point from Gwadar port. Tonight.
