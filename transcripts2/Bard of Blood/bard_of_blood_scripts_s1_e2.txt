 The number you are trying to reach has been switched off. Trying to make your assessment of the crime scene. Turn around. And no tricks or else I will shoot. Jai Hind, sir. TThe neighbour called in about suspicious activity. But this is a crime scene. Yes, sir. Sadiq Sheikh. Looks like someone important. Yes. We found a man at the crime scene. We've detained him.

 What's your name? Kabir Anand. Some Kabir Anand. Fine. Consider it done. Sir! What was Kabir Anand doing here? The police found him here. They said he was looking for something. What happened to Sadiq? Sadiq Sheikh was having a drink with his crossword during the intrusion. Nothing is missing. No prints, except Kabir's. Take Kabir in... - and confiscate his phone. - Sir.

 - Where is the body? - In there. Mr. Joshi, are we well prepared for the Indo-China Summit? Yes, sir. Everything is in order. Just one little thing. Yeah... I'm sure you got the news... our Joint Director, Sadiq Sheikh passed away. No. Should I be worried? No, sir. Just to let you know. This is a murder, but we're showing it as a natural death, to contain and assess enemy reactions. Will this affect the Chinese Premier's summit? There's no negative information from the Intelligence Bureau. Same here for the Military Intelligence, sir. It's just a protocol. There's no cause for alarm. Your second-in-command was murdered... and you make it sound like everything is normal. Please find out who killed him. Yes, sir. - And make sure I get regular updates. - Yes, sir. Joshi is a bloody bureaucrat. This case is out of the agency's league. Don't waste time on me. Kabir Anand, I would seriously advise you to cooperate. Otherwise what? You'll have me arrested for causing a heart attack? The agency is being lenient with you. You can call it a favour if you like. "Leniency? Favor?" You must have recently come on board. He was murdered the day you landed in Delhi. Coincidence? - Why did you come here? - That's none of your business. Convince me. Not my MO. I am a clean killer. If I ever kill you... the investigation will turn cold even before your body. Heart attack type. Are you threatening me? No. That's a promise. What were you doing in Sadiq Sheikh's home? Sadiq sir... Manners have to be a part of your upbringing. The agency can't teach you everything. I went to meet him. You mean you arrived at his place, noticed his body... you didn't bother calling the police, or the agency... and turned his place upside down. What were you looking for? His killer's out there. Doing your job for you. If you read my file, then you must know my history with Sadiq sir. It's all in there. We had lost touch. And for the past... Wait a second. You haven't read my file. Because you don't have clearance. And yet they sent you out here to interrogate me. Sir, your new recruits are mediocre. Relax. You're losing it. Are you an amateur by any chance. Stop licking Joshi's boots. This is not the way to impress him. He wants an interrogation and you're displaying your combat skills. Let's take a polygraph test. Aakash, he can cheat the polygraph in his sleep. Let him go. The funeral is at 12. Nizamuddin. Speak up. Who were you spying for? Go from here. Speak up. Who were you spying for? Speak up, you bloody Indian. Stop. That's enough What are you up to? We were interrogating them for some information. On whose orders? All you can do is... torture them. How will you win a war? Remember... to win a war... you have to be either ruthless... or sometimes benevolent. Marvelous. Marvelous. Marvelous. You see that? With my guidance and his brilliance... Aftab will soon turn into a fine leader. - He has a long journey ahead of him. - Amen. I've gone through his phone with a fine comb. But there is nothing on it. Except for videos of a kid. Vikramjeet's kid. Sir, I don't comprehend. Why will Kabir kill Sadiq Sheikh? There's a lot you can't comprehend, Nihar. - Did you pick up any chatter? - No, sir. Okay, sir. "Your papa was a brave man. And when the brave die, you don't cry.'" "This won't change anything. I will be around... always." Pardon me but your brake light doesn't seem to be working. It can be a nuisance later. You will find Nawab mechanic around the corner. He does a good job. Thank you. Why weren't you at the crime scene? No clearance. Listen, I can't trust anyone. Only Sadiq Sir's inner circle knew about Sadiq Mechanic. He trusted you more than the agency. If you had listened to him, he would still be alive. So selfish. We need to find out who Sadiq Sir's killer is. Can you trace a number for me? Whose is it? Sadiq sir's private number. For special signals? Was the input from Balochistan sent on this? The code was sent on this..., and the input was on the computer. The killer wiped the computer but took the phone. And I can't believe he will keep the phone on. I don't think he had the time to delete the data on the phone. Because for that one needs to switch on the phone. Exactly. Hey. Nihar, listen. I need personal favour. My maid lost her smartphone. I can get you the exact same location. Send me the number. That way. This man was at Sadiq sir's funeral clicking pictures. And bolted when he saw me. - Why would he do that? - Don't know. Proof of death. - But who is it for? - What did Sadiq Sir tell you? Something big is going to happen in Balochistan. Past is repeating itself. The answers we seek lie buried in the sands of Balochistan. What answers? I don't know. But something changed between our meeting... and the call he made to me at the airport. He wanted you to rescue those four agents. - That's certain. - Maybe he didn't want just a rescue. He wanted me to lead a three-man mission... off the records. He told you all that? While waiting for me at his home he was playing Sudoku. And he wrote letters in the blank spaces instead of numbers. This was moments before his death, so... probably he was thinking about the mission. He wrote "ADO" in the first square. Which is my code name. In the second one, he wrote X which probably meant that he wasn't sure. And on the third code... This is something I can't figure out. "RLB." Sorry, please repeat that. RLB. Do you know that guy? It's a female. RLB is short for Rani Laxmi Bai. Sadiq sir used to joke that... if he sends me on a mission my code will be Rani Laxmi Bai. always thought... Why would he want to send a woman to Balochistan? Paying their respects to a man they killed. Reminds me when I was on the field. Wait a second. Wait a second. - I never imagined I will see him again. - Let me see. Who is this man? Kabir Anand. Indian Spy. Former... But after I was through with him... his career ended in a disaster. People claim I've no heart. But I feel pity for his condition. And the question is... how do we leave the country without the agency's aide. That's my lookout. We need to find "X," the third agent. Do you have access to Sadiq sir's cash stash? Yes, but there's not much, to begin with. We'll never be able to hire a professional mercenary without the agency's help. Then? We cannot move the agents planted by the agency in Balochistan. We will get exposed. Unless... Unless we find an agent the agency has long forgotten. And this will be a sanctioned mission for him. How come you're not singing? This is your favorite song. I have a bad feeling. I don't know why. The guards at the next check post have changed. - Our friends won't be there today. - And you're telling me this now? Hundred meters from the border. We can't turn back now. I am telling you this only because you mentioned it. When I get a "bad feeling," I always want to know why. What do we do? There are 12 kilograms of heroin. God help us. God does not help criminals. Just hope, they are worse criminals than us. Move. Go..Go.. Hurry up! Look here, sir. Sir. It's smelling really bad, sir. Check. What's in there? It smells. Shit smells! They are goats, sir. A palace or a prison for them the whole world is a toilet. - Papers? - Yes, sir. Sir. Thank you. The goats were a good idea. But what have you fed them? Their shit still smells. Maybe they had a bad feeling too. What happened? I got to pee. - Hello. - Veer Singh. It's Isha Khanna, Balochistan Desk. IIW Headquarters. - How are you doing? - How am I doing? Like a completely clueless man. This phone rang after a year. Do you get my weekly reports? Of course, we do. And the agency is very happy with your work in Afghanistan. In fact, they have decided to give you an interim break. After a small assignment, you can go home. - Is it true? - Yes. Can you handle it? Of course, I can. But are you completely sure I can go home after this? Absolutely. - Any doubts or questions? - No doubts. Thank you. Finally, back to Punjab and booze. Who were you talking to? Ghani. Ghani. My cousin Habib from Kohat. What's wrong with you? Is this a joke? You tell me. You're the one stealing money. Ghani. Ghani. Will you kill a friend... without hearing him out first? I have proved that I am a loyal fighter. You know that. I will get all of it back. Who did you give it to? Who was on the phone? Oh. You know him. You know him very well. You have met and spoken to him. Phone. Yes. It was a call from Hell. Your father misses you. We fly to Kandahar via Dubai. We don't have much time. The message we received from the Taliban... The source has been traced to Quetta. According to sources, that's where the Taliban Leader Mullah Khalid is too. Quetta, huh? I have the exact coordinates to the location. Heavily guarded area. How will it be possible without the agency's help? You have too much faith in the agency and too little in criminals. My grandma lost her ring. I want another one made that looks exactly the same. Did it get misplaced or stolen? How does it matter? I've some designs in the workshop. - So sir, which country? - Emirates. Hamid and Saida Ahmed. I can't believe this. Sadiq Sir used to respect all kinds of talent. I hope I can do this right for Sadiq Sir. It's done. Thank you. Is Sadiq Sir's funeral over? Are you alright? I'm disappearing for a few days. Where are you going? Balochistan. Why dig up old graves, Kabir? To bury my past once and for all. I need to find out who Sadiq Sir's killer is. He can't have died for nothing. Take care, bye. Mom, I am leaving. Did you pack some sunscreen? And which swimming costume are you taking? I am off to Goa on a holiday. I'll buy a costume when I get there. What's wrong with you? I need to get over Sadiq Sir's death. Or I can't get back to work. Or I will never be able to focus on my job. How difficult is that to understand? I don't get you. Fine. Take care. And listen... What now? I love you, Mom. I don't say it enough. Can we trust that man? Relax. I hope it will be fine. ...from Dubai to Kandahar are requested... - Purpose of visit? - Meeting with relatives. - Duration of the stay? - One month. You are travelling alone? No... my husband. Fingerprint. Half the battle won. Getting caught here was your last chance of escape. Mrs. Saida Ahmed, the battle hasn't even begun. Welcome to Kandahar Airport. What's that smell in the car? Someone was smoking weed in here. Not my car, sir. And weed is pretty common out here. You'll find every other person smoking weed. Update on the gear. It's all in here. Phone interception devices. Satellite masking devices. Drone interception devices. Earpieces. Two bug scanners, three micro cameras and... guns. I didn't want to leave any space for errors since it's my last job. I'll drop you two in Quetta. Take the saint's blessings and head straight to the airport. By the way sir, when was your last visit to Balochistan? Five years ago. And you aren't going anywhere. You are staying with us until the end of this mission. But... I had no such instructions. Don't worry. - It will take less than a week. - I am not worried. I've been hearing it for almost a year. So forgive me if I don't trust you. Veer, we need you. Your skills are important to us. We cannot complete this mission without you. Well... those were also my father's words seven years ago... when I was leaving home. "Son. this family needs you." Even we left our homes behind, Veer... so that four more like you can go home. What are you planning in Quetta? Rescue Operation. The Taliban has four of our agents. Is that a joke? You do know it's ISA's headquarters and stronghold. Yes, we know what to do. The mission's been planned by the agency's senior leaders. Just follow orders... and we will all take the Saint's blessings and go home. And... what are my orders? Stop making rotten faces. How far out is the border? We already crossed the border, sir. Welcome to Pakistan! First world rules don't apply here. The borders here are very porous. And since this isn't a smuggling route, there are no check posts either. We will reach Quetta in 2 hours. By the way, what is the plan? Get us to Quetta without drawing any attention. That's the top priority. What was your cover in Afghanistan? Transport. I infiltrated a Taliban group. I used to help smuggle their heroin across the border. That's why I chose this route. It's a short cut and there are no checkpoints either. You said there are no checkpoints on this route? Is that the welcoming committee? Stop. Stop. Stop. - Don't worry. I'll handle them. - Do what you have to. But be careful. Let me do the talking. - Hello, sir. - Where to? - Quetta. - Why Quetta? My guests have some business there? Lower the window. Where are they from? Emirates, sir. - They are looking to adopt a child. - Adopt? Why didn't you tell him to get a new wife... or is he shooting blanks? Come out. - Let us go. - I said come out! Of course. - You own this car, don't you? - I do. I can show you the documents... Hey,...the documents can wait. Come on. - Where are you coming from? - The Airport. And where are you headed? As I said this fine gentleman and lady want to... adopt a child. So that's where I am taking them. Stop cooking up stories, or we will have to permanently adopt you. Sir... I pray the day never comes when I'll have to sit on your lap. This man can screw things up. I've seen agents like him before. The agency doesn't care about them...and they think they have autonomy. They forget how to take orders. Pay for three persons and get going. But there are only two men. You don't count women. You are an interesting person. Then 20,000 for two men and get lost. Don't you think that's too much? I can't afford my team second-guessing me on this. This man's been on the field for 7 years straight. In this wilderness. Give him a break. On your knees! On your knees! My men tell me that you are all innocent brethren. Innocent or not... if you're a Muslim, then you will pray with us. We are the Taliban. We live to serve our God. And even allow sinners a chance to pray. We are taking mercy on you... so Allah can be merciful to us. You can all pray now. It's evident how you're serving your God. If you were a true Muslim... then you would've strangled your paedophile father. You're an infidel. You're all infidels. You think the cops are on to him? Unlikely. Talibani smugglers and the Police are hand-in-glove. Check the car. See what else you can find? "When sorrow comes, it comes with a battalion." You called my father the Supreme Leader, an infidel. Am I wrong? God's grace can turn even infidels into believers. But you... You all are far from the truth. In fact, your darkness corrupts His Glory. Take cover, Veer. No, my brother. It's you who is blinded to his Glory. We the learned ones are the only ones who know the eternal truth. And only we have been blessed with this privilege... to eliminate the growing ignorance, with the Message from our Lord. Close in. Sir. Out of bullets. When the Lord's glory is evident even blind will witness it. Except for those, who have made a deal with the Devil. Surround them! And they must be sacrificed for the good of humanity.
