 You've trained hard. You've gotten stronger, tougher, faster. You've done your best. You're ready for this tournament, am I right? Yes, Sensei! Wrong! Your best ain't shit! If you want to win the All-Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament, you gotta give me better than your best. Which is why from now on, you're gonna get my worst. - You understand? - Yes, Sensei!

 - Are you losers? - No, Sensei! - Are you nerds? - No, Sensei! - Are you sure? - No, Sensei! Move those feet, go, go, go! Your enemies are all around you. Destroy them! * We're not gonna take it * Let's go, Squirt, good job, buddy. Go! Atta boy! Come on, princess, let's go, move that ass. There's nothing to fear except for fear itself, and not falling in a bunch of sharp metal and broken glass, so don't do that! - Whoa! - Oh my goodness!

 You want to win, you gotta be hungry. You guys hungry? Yes, Sensei! Good. So are they. Oh, shit! * We're not gonna take it anymore * Don't be afraid! They smell fear! * We're not gonna take it * * No, we ain't gonna take it * * We're not gonna take it anymore * OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Grandma! Hey, cutie, give me a hug! Oh, Sammie! When are you gonna stop getting so pretty? There are those baby browns! Get over here! Hey, Ma. You know, it's bad enough that this monster is teaching kids. Now he's somehow convinced the All Valley Board to let Cobra Kai back into the tournament. Oh, that's horrible. They can't let them back. Oh, they're nothing but a bunch of bullies. They can't all be bullies, right? Trust me, sweetheart, you don't know the half of it. Those Cobra jerks made my little boy's life miserable. Tell them how they pushed you down that hill. They've already heard it, Ma. I thought it was a cliff. Pasta salad? Oh, no, thank you. I don't like that prepackaged stuff from the store. Oh. Well, I would've made some, but I got home late from the dealership. Oh, no. That's okay. I get it. It's tough being a working mom, but at least you have a partner. Remember how I used to come home from work and then started cooking from scratch? Yeah, Ma. You know, that son of a bitch has a lot of nerve entering the tournament, especially after everything he's done to you. And you fixed his car for free. I don't know, man. I say we get the car back. You know, I could find out where he lives. Dad, what if Cobra Kai has changed? I mean, there's some kids from my school who are in it, and it doesn't automatically make them bad, right? Please, Cobra Kai will never change. Promise me you stay away from the kids who are associated with it. All right? Okay, okay, that's enough. Save some for the tournament. Why am I the only one here, sensei? 'Cause let's face it, you're the only chance I got at winning this thing. So what? I'm your best student? Don't flatter yourself. Have you seen the others? What's so funny? Oh, nothing, just this funny picture my girlfriend posted. Wait a second. Is that Daniel LaRusso's daughter? Yeah, you know Samantha? You're dating a LaRusso? Yeah, why? Is something wrong? We need to talk. It was the summer of '82. "Rocky III" had just come out. My buddy Dutch was a huge Mr. T fan, so we went to the local theater to check it out. Sitting in front of us was this group of cute chicks, eating popcorn. Dutch started throwing Milk Duds at them. What? Why would he do that? Because it's an alpha move, man. Babes love when you treat them like crap. Anyway, eventually, the girls got so pissed off, one of them stood up and started yelling at us. That's when I saw her for the first time. Saw who? Ali. She dumped popcorn all over Dutch, got butter all over him. - I could tell right away, man, this chick was a firecracker. So did you ask her out? Yeah, I hit on her a few times till she gave me a chance. We went to Golf N' Stuff for our first date. Kissed on the Ferris wheel. We were madly in love. Dated for two years. For, uh, Valentine's Day, instead of rings, I gave her this pink jelly bracelet. She gave me this. So then what happened? Summer before my senior year, we got into a fight. I figured we'd work things out eventually. Then Daniel LaRusso came to town. This is it. This is the end of the line. Next thing I know, he's hitting on her. I see the two of them flirting with each other. What'd you do? Well, I walked over to have a civil conversation with Ali. What is your problem? Look, why don't you just take your little Cobra Kais and get out of here, all right? Oh, yeah, right, and that's gonna solve everything! But LaRusso kept butting in. - What's going on? - You want it? - Yeah, just give it to me. - You got it! I told him to get lost, mind your own business. nny: Out of nowhere, the guy sucker punches me. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! What an asshole. I know, man. nny: I did what any dude would do, I defended myself. You know, I figured that was that. LaRusso wouldn't leave it alone. nny: At the Halloween dance, I was sitting there, minding my own business, he douses me with a water hose. I hadn't seen the guy in months. Frickin' turns a water hose on my head! nny: So I chase him down, try to put an end to things that night, right? Turns out the guy's got a karate master of his own. nny: Guy comes out of nowhere, jumps us, assaults me and my friends. I think my buddy Tommy got brain damage 'cause of that fight. Oh my God. Eventually, we decided to work things out at the All Valley Tournament. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? MC: The final match: Daniel LaRusso, Miyaji-do Karate versus John Lawrence of the Cobra Kai. nny: So we both made it to the finals. It was 2-2... What--what happened? Who won? LaRusso won, I lost. But what's worse is that I lost Ali. Yeah. All right, the reason I'm telling you all this is 'cause you gotta watch out for the LaRussos. Hey, I've heard you've gotten back into karate. Yeah, it had been too long. There's this kid Robby who works at the dealership. We train together. Ma, I tell you, I just didn't realize I missed it so much... Missed him so much. Mr. Miyagi... He was so good to us. Ma, the best. Well, I just got a call from the dealership. Sheila just said that a couple sketchy guys rolled up on motorcycles looking for Louie. Oh, yeah, I forgot to tell you. I met these bikers when I was at the auto convention in Vegas. We got hammered at the Palms, man, we were drinking boilermakers, it was a sick time. Anyway, uh, long story short, when they found out who I was, we came up with this great idea. LaRusso Luxury Motorcycles. What are you talking about? Relax, I just said we'd start with four, and then work our way from there. Louie, what did I say about using my name to make deals? I'm sorry, cuz. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Where have we heard that before? Hey, be nice, he just made a mistake. A mistake is forgetting to lock up work, which he has done several times. This is interfering with our business, so just stay out of it. Stay out of it. That's a very nice way to talk to your mother-in-law. Ma, she didn't mean it that way. No, no, I meant it that way, okay? Because if it wasn't for her, we never would've hired Louie in the first place. - Amanda. - Hey! He's family, and you always take care of family! We do take care of family! - - Because not only did we hire Louie, we also host Thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter-- Host? Oh, come on! It's easy to host when everything is catered. Ma, Ma. Is this about the pasta salad? What do you want, Lucille? Whatever you want, I will go into that kitchen - and I will make it right now. - No, forget it. If you're going to the kitchen, I'll take another Yoo-hoo. Oh my God, Anthony, you make everything worse. - Shut up. - Hey, don't say, "Shut up." Don't say that word. I don't like that word. Hey, guys. How was training? Oh, your son's doing great. Miggy, go get cleaned up. Yaya's making seco de carne. Okay, bye, Sensei. All right, see you. Do you have dinner plans? Me? Uh... Yeah, I got a couple Hot Pockets. I'm good. That sounds like the opposite of good. Want to join us? Uh, thanks, but I wouldn't want to, you know, bother you guys. It's no bother. We have plenty of food. - Well, I would, but-- - No buts. My dojo, my rules. ...Johnny. In nombre de padre, y mijo, y spiritus sancto. Amen. - Amen. - Amen. Amen! That one I know. Okay, let's eat. So, um, Miguel told me all about the tournament. I hope he doesn't get hurt. Mom, I told you there's referees. You can't get hurt. At least not permanently. He'll be fine. So have you always lived in Reseda? No, I grew up in Encino. Really? Really nice houses there. Yeah. Well, just because you live in a nice house doesn't mean nice things are going on inside. Mmm! I really like these bananas! They're called plantains. Oh. In English, we call them bananas. What's so funny? Oh, God, sorry. Answer it, Mijo, it's fine. Don't take too long, your food's gonna get cold. Okay. He has a girlfriend. - Hey. - Hey. It's good to see you. My house is like World War III right now. Oh, no, that's not good. What's going on? It's my mom and my grandma. They just go at each other sometimes. I'm probably gonna end up being the peace negotiator all weekend. Yeah, well, I was hoping maybe we could go to the movies tomorrow? Well, what about Sunday? Oh, I can't, I have Cobra Kai training all day. All day? Isn't that a little excessive? Yeah, but Sensei thinks I really have a shot at winning this tournament, so I got to give it my all. You know, I was thinking, there's a bunch of other dojos in the valley. I don't know, maybe give a different dojo a try? What? No, I could never do that to Sensei Lawrence. I mean, he's tough, but he makes us tough. I mean, you could ask Aisha, Hawk-- actually, you can't ask Hawk right now. He's in the hospital getting rabies shots. Sam, I really need you out here. Your mom and grandma are about to kill each other. Come on. Sure, I'll be right there. Who are you talking to? Uh, nobody. Just my lab partner. Okay, come on. Sorry about that. Uh... Uh, yeah. No problem. I'm so glad Miguel's finally making some nice friends. It's been difficult for him. We've had to move around a lot. Where are you guys from originally? - Ecuador. - Oh. Why'd you leave? Mama. Um, I got married at 18. After I became pregnant with Miguel, I learned the truth about my husband's job. Let's just say he was a very bad man. I had to get far away from him. - Sorry to hear that. - Don't be sorry. I moved on long ago. You can't let the mistakes of the past determine your future. Oh, hey. Hi. Sorry, I was... I was looking for Mr. LaRusso. He's been training me back here in the dojo. Then I should thank you. He tried roping me into it. So you must be the daughter he talks about all the time. I would hope so! I'm Samantha. Robby. Oh, look at this. My current student and my former student. You know, if you want to join us, Sam, there's still time. I'm actually going to the mall with Mom and Grandma. Oh, that's good, just text me if there's any bloodshed. Robby, give me a hand with this, we're gonna take the SUV. Bye-bye, sweetheart. - Bye, Dad. Have fun. - Good luck! It was nice meeting you. You too. And, uh, good luck with the tree. Robby! Tree? What tree? Where are we going? Don't worry, you'll see. iel: When I was a kid, Mr. Miyagi took me to this beautiful lake up North to train. I tried to take Samantha there once, but after the draught, it's become more of a puddle. So I found this spot instead. You hear that? Hmm? You hear that? I want you to close your eyes and just listen. What do you hear? Um... Nothing. Exactly. No phone calls, no internet, no family arguments, just you and Mother Nature. That's why we're here. This is what Miyagi-do karate is all about. Come on. Man on TV: It's nice of you to join us for the occasion, Mr. Iron Eagle, sir. Man on TV: Chappy? Hey! Man on TV: You told us you went down on the Med. Man on TV: Well, I did! I had to do a little dogpaddling for a while, till I got picked up by this Egyptian trawler. Okay, like I told you, make a strong front stance. Okay? When you throw, you're gonna twist your hips, snap the punch. All the power right here, in this one inch, okay? - You got it? - Yes. Hi! Hiyah! Hi-yah! Wow, I feel like I'm, like, Jackie Chan. I've got to admit, you're more of a natural than I was. But don't get too cocky, there's always another lesson to be learned. Is that a Mr. Miyagi saying? Nah, I just made that one up on the fly. Not bad, right? So we headed home? You wish. Training ain't over yet. You may know the moves, but none of that matters unless you have balance. I balance on my skateboard every day. I didn't mean balancing your body. I mean balancing your life. Look, Robby, I know it's hard growing up without a dad. Believe me, mine died when I was young, so I know. But when those bad feelings all weigh you down, you gotta... you gotta search inside for the good stuff, you know, and just... Because then you can find some balance in your life. You understand? It's not easy, but you'll do it. Mr. LaRusso, I need to tell you something. Sure. What is it? bby: I got a gig over at LaRusso Auto. My dad hates his guts. When he finds out I'm working for him, he's gonna lose his shit. Thanks for teaching me. No, don't thank me yet. You're about to hate me. Shed that duffel bag and get up on this tree right here. Come on! All right, now find your balance. All right, now show me what we learned today. Let's start with a front kick. Not bad, try a round kick. Is this supposed to be hard? All right, hot shot. Show me a hook kick. Ah! Oof! There it is. You all right? Yeah. What do I do now? You get back up and you try it again. You let me know when you can do all the kicks without falling. Where are you going? The Devils are playing the Islanders on the East Coast. I'm gonna move to a spot with better service. What happened to no distractions? Hockey doesn't count! Hey, what's wrong? I can't stop thinking about what Sensei told me about Sam's dad. So Sensei and Sam's dad had some beef. What that have to do with you? Do I have to spell it out for you? Sam's dad hates Cobra Kai, I'm a part of Cobra Kai. So by the transitive property, Sam's dad is gonna hate me. Jesus Christ, you're such a nerd. I'm telling you, it's not just on my mind. Sam was acting weird the other day when her dad walked by. Mm, listen, I've known Mr. LaRusso since third grade. He's a really nice guy, you just have to talk to him. I haven't even been invited over yet. She's probably too afraid to introduce me. Dude, just go over there. It's an alpha move. Who the hell did that? - Mr. LaRusso? - Huh? I almost did it. Almost. What were you doing? One of the last things Mr. Miyagi ever taught me. The most powerful kick in Miyagi-do karate. How do you do it? I wish I could show you. Only Mr. Miyagi could do it. You have to balance your whole body on one hand which frees up two legs for the kick. I almost did it once when I was in my 20s, so the fact that I got this close today, pretty damn awesome. How'd you do on the tree? I did all the moves without falling. Good. Now that you've mastered that, you're ready for the next challenge. What's that? Finding the car. This place is like a maze. Sid: Hey! I said I wanted my bagel toasted! This is like I'm biting a sponge! You're not paying me to cook! You're lucky I pay you at all! Someone's at the door! You think I don't know that? Who the hell knows what you know? Oh my God. If it ain't the karate king! What's the matter? Let me guess. Let me guess, let me guess... You're low on funds. Sorry, kid. No bailouts. This ain't Wall Street! What's that? What are you, a mailman? It's your money. Good God almighty. It's all there. What do you want me to do? Leave it here on the table till you come back next week? I won't be back. Of course you'll be back! You need my money! I never needed your money. It's just the only thing you had to give. Goodbye, Sid. Stick your finger in it and tell me if it's good. - What do you think? - It's disgusting. It's delicious, it's delicious, what are you talking about? How could it get any better than that? What are you talking about? - Ah, look who's here! Come on in. - Hey! Amanda and I are making dinner. Yeah, your mom made her famous chicken cacciatore. Yes, but with the help of your beautiful wife. Oh, stop. You owe me big time. How did you do it? Hey! You know what? I don't even care. I'm hungry. Hey, you hungry? You want to stay for dinner? Uh, sure. Yeah. Thanks. Hey, Ma, where's Louie? Uh, he said he couldn't make it tonight. Keeps getting better. Hi, Mr. LaRusso. I'm Miguel. I'm... Hi, Mr. LaRusso, I'm Miguel, and I'm... Sam's boyfriend. You had to have fallen off more than once. I slipped once, but, you know, I caught myself and climbed back up, so that doesn't count. No, that totally counts as falling. bby: You got to tell them about the handstand. nda: No, you didn't. iel: Oh, I almost did it this time. - - iel: I got this close! - Uh-huh. - It was incredible. - How much did he pay you - to stay that? - Don't start with that. Dear Robby, I know you refuse to answer my calls. And I refuse to text or e-mail, so I'm going old school and writing this letter. I've done a lot of thinking lately and realized just how much I've screwed up my life. But my biggest screw-up is my relationship with you. I know I can't change the past, but if you give me a chance... This'll teach that piece of shit not to mess with my family. - There you go! - Whoo! Hey, "Sons of Anarchy," I said we just wanted to send him a message, not burn down the whole block! Hey, what the hell are you doing? Consider this a message from Daniel LaRusso. What are you gonna do, Nancy? Hey, look, man, back up, man. I got a bat, man! Back up, I got a bat! All right, look. Things got away from me, okay? Just calm down! Where does Daniel LaRusso live? This is between me and you, it's got nothing to do with him. I made all that shit up! I'll take my licks like a man! Hey, asshole! Burn in hell. Holy shit. Where does Daniel LaRusso live? Encino Hills! Escalon Drive! So what'd you do last night? Uh, just a family dinner. I'd like to meet them sometime. Okay. Yeah. Sam's given you no reason not to trust her. Wait, wait, look. Jasmine's throwing a birthday party at the canyon later? Not if we strike first. No effin' way. How did everyone get here so early? Seriously, Moon? These look like people I'd invite? Robby needs a ride home, so drop him off and come right back, okay? So where we going? I haven't told my dad that I'm dating Miguel. Why have you been keeping it a secret? tha: My dad hates Miguel's sensei. And I know if he found out, he would totally lose his shit.
