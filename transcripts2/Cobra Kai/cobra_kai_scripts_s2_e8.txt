 ♪ Like a drifter  I was born to walk alone ♪ And I've made up my mind ♪ Baby ♪ And I ain't wasting  no more time ♪ And here I go again  on my own ♪ Goin' down the only road  I've ever known ♪ He's alive. I made you some breakfast. Bacon and eggs. I even bought you the Minute Maid because I know you hate the fancy stuff. Thanks, Mom. How's the guest bedroom? You have everything you need? No, no. It's fine. What about you? I feel like I'm coming down with a fever.

 I don't wanna get Amanda sick. A fever? Mmm. Fever. Right. You might wanna work on that so you can get off the couch. I know. I'm working on it. Wait. Aren't we supposed to be leading warm-ups? Yeah, but your grandma's staying at the house, so this is the only private time we're gonna get. You know we're gonna have to tell my parents at some point. It's just not great timing. They're in the middle of a fight. So we'll wait for the right time. Hey, guys, check it out! Look what I found. It was just sitting in these rocks. Is that Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor? That's crazy. We looked all over for this. Huh. Must have been here the whole time. Did you see how she looked at me when I said, "Two lumps"? Oh, good morning. Are you heading out? I think Miguel left already. Oh, yeah, yeah. Just, uh, on my way, so... Johnny, uh, this is Graham. Pleased to meet you, mate. Oh. Cracking strong grip. Best take me in for X-rays. Isn't he funny? Yeah, he's very... Well, see you later, Johnny. All right, I'll see you later. He teaches my son karate. Wow. Is that lunch from Sugar Fish? And look at that. Matcha green tea from Urth Caffe. Someone must have trekked over the hill. Thank you. But I actually... And before you even bring up the inventory statements, I've already taken them off your plate. I finished them an hour ago. So, I don't know about you, but that toro right there is calling my name. I've got a lunch with the sales team over at Woodland Hills. It's on our joint calendar. But, um, you enjoy. But it's a lot of sushi. Share it with the customers. Hey. There's free sushi in there if you're hungry. Thank you. What about Friday? I can't. I'm working at the roller rink. Great. Let's turn it into a date night. Candlelit dinner at the snack bar on my break? Look, there's nothing more romantic than free hot dogs and chicken nugs. Free? Not for you. You gotta pay up. I'll splurge. All right. But you gotta wear a costume. It's '80s night. Are you kidding? I love the '80s. Dibs on Anthony Michael Hall in Weird Science. I don't think you have to call dibs on that. One second. Hey. What's up? About Coyote Creek, we cool? We were enemies for a day, but Cobra Kai for life. Everybody, fall in. Today, we'll be learning one of the most important lessons a Cobra Kai could ever know. Where's Sensei Kreese? Shouldn't we wait for the sensei emeritus before we get going? Or not. Mr. Kreese will no longer be joining us. Seriously? I made a promise when I became your sensei. To always look out for your best interests. Despite how hard this may be for all of us, he didn't have our best interests at heart. John Kreese may have founded Cobra Kai, but he no longer represents what this dojo stands for. His Cobra Kai was old and outdated. He refused to move forward, and what happens when we do that, Mr. Diaz? You get stuck like cement. Exactly. To be a great fighter, you gotta learn to adapt. This creed on the wall... Follow it to the letter, it'll make you strong. It'll make you formidable. It'll also make you an asshole. 'Cause that's just black paint on a white wall. But life's not black and white. More often than not, it's gray. And it's in those gray areas where Johnny Lawrence's Cobra Kai sometimes shows mercy. Doesn't mean you can't be badass. It's still a requirement. But you have to learn to think, not just with your gut, or your fists, but to really use this. Which leads me to today's lesson. Headbutting. Grab a partner. That was awesome. Do me next. Hey, uh, Sensei. Just tuck in your chin and aim for the nose with the crown of your head. It's not that hard. No, it's not about headbutting. I think I got that down. It's about Sensei Kreese. What about him? I know he's your friend, so if you wanna talk... You don't have to worry about me. Besides, you should be focused on that girlfriend of yours. You know about that? I'm not blind. Just don't get distracted. Yeah. All right? You can play "hide the plantain" on your own time. But in class, I need you focused. Yes, Sensei. What about you? Do you have any, uh... Don't worry about me, all right? I do just fine. Okay. If you wanted to, I could set you up on an app. That's how my mom found her boyfriend. Yeah, how's that going? It's going well. She's had some pretty bad luck with guys, so it's nice to see her happy. That's good. I'm glad to hear that. So, uh, all right, what's the deal with this app thing? So, we have some new cars on the showroom floor. Let's get the detail guys in here because they can never be too... ...clean. All right. Here you go. No, no. Demetri, you know this. Wax on with the right hand, counter-clockwise with the left. Watch Demetri. He's got it. Not bad, right? Child labor. That's a bold move. It's crazy no one's ever thought of it. Ten more minutes of training, okay? Wait, wait. No, no. It's not training. This is me trying to help. Say I'm sorry. What else can I do, Amanda? It's not a puzzle, Daniel. Look, I don't wanna fight. I just know that this is not permanent. Neither is sushi. You can't put a Band-Aid on an open head wound. Our marriage is an open head wound? Pick whatever analogy you want. You know what I mean. Okay. The app is downloaded. What type of women are you looking to meet? Super hot babes. Dumb question. Okay, what are your likes? My likes? Mmm-hmm. What am I supposed to say? Long walks on the beach? I like muscle cars, martial arts and Iron Eagle. And Iron Eagle II. Why aren't you texting this down? Computer dating was your idea. Look, you have to take this seriously. It used to be simple. Find a chick in a bar. Bump into her hard, but not too hard. Pretty hard. Then you buy her a beer. No. Tried and true, Diaz. That's how the cavemen did it. Cavemen. That's another like. Like the ones in those insurance commercials. I think I can fill out the rest of this on my own. What about clothes? What are you wearing? You gonna teach me about fashion now? Might have to. Okay. So, I was thinking a buttoned-up shirt and some distressed jeans. You have any of those? I have old jeans, if that's what you're saying. Hey. There's a chick on my app. Yeah, look, all right. Just swipe right if you like her and we'll set up a bunch of dates. This is dumb. You can't find anything out about a chick from one look... Ooh, this one's hot. Hey, can I borrow this jacket? Huh? Yeah, whatever. No. No. Not with a ten-foot pole. Lose that mole, you're in. Eh. Actually, yes. Hey, Sammy. Come help me with the groceries. Oh. I didn't realize you were both here. Hi, Mrs. LaRusso. Hi. I got a couple more bags in the car. Be a help, will you? Unless we wanna keep avoiding your family, we should probably go out one of these nights. My oldest is eight, and I also have a 4-year-old. There they are. Oh, they're so cute. Thanks. It's tough trying to meet someone who likes to have fun, but also knows how to handle kids. With my job, I'm around kids all the time, so... Believe me, I know how to handle them. That is so good to hear. This one time, this kid in my class was texting on his phone. Mmm-hmm. So I body-slammed him into the mat, flying elbow to his teeth. One sec. I gotta read this email real quick. You can read your email on that thing? Yeah. You've never seen a smartwatch? Oh, smartwatch. Yeah. I read my emails all the time. In my smartphone. It's an Ericsson. I try to stay active in a variety of organizations. We combat all institutions of oppression. Runaway capitalism, climate change denial, the patriarchy. The problem is, a lot of these issues are becoming systemic. Oh, yeah. Totally systemic. I hate the Patriots, too. Listen, what do you say we quit the chit-chat, and hop in my Challenger? Teach you how to drive a stick. If you know what I mean. Johnny, right? Sorry I'm late. The traffic on the 101 was just... Wait. Have we met before? I don't know. Hold on. You're that dumb asshole who hung my TV on the wrong wall. You never told me which wall to put it on. Because of you, I got fired. You called me a bitch! No, I said you were bitching at me! You know what? That's it. I'm done with these shitty apps. Bitch. What's this? Ah, just taking a walk down memory lane. A scrapbook? I thought everything was in the cloud now. I'll digitize it sooner or later. It's just, something about these old pictures. Looking at them on your phone just doesn't do them justice, you know? Very true. Ooh, you got some good ones. Look at my hair. The '80s! Oh, man. It'll get better. She'll come around. I know, Ma. I've tried every grand gesture I could think of. Remember Coney Island? It's about the best day of my life. Dad and I ate something from every booth on the row. Nathan's... Cotton candy, frozen custard, you name it. He still took me on the Cyclone five times in a row. That sounds like him. It was about the time he started getting sick. You know what I remember? What? What do you call... What was it, uh... "The Wonder Wheel." That's what it was. Oh, yeah. My God. That amazing view. No. No, no, no. The line. That's what I remember. It wasn't the lights, it wasn't the ride. It was the smallest moment. We were waiting in line on the Wonder Wheel, and, uh... Just us. And Dad held my hand and he put his head on my shoulder. Right here. And he told me he loved me. I could still feel his hair on my cheek. That's all I ever wanted to know. That he was in it with me. No matter what. I love you. Love you, Ma. ♪ I got it so bad ♪ I just want to say that ♪ I swear I can't hide ♪ How I feel about you ♪ How I feel about you ♪ How I feel about you ♪ How I feel about you ♪ Hey, it's been a long time. But just signed up on the Facebook. It's an app on my smartphone. Maybe we connect one of these days? Johnny. Nah, too desperate. Hey. Shit. Sorry about that. It's all right. No sweat. Let me make it up to you. Buy you another Banquet? Yeah. ♪ Take your baby  by the hand ♪ And make her do  a high handstand ♪ Gotta say, I wasn't sure about the costumes, but it's definitely nice not having to sneak around. I still think you should have dressed like Andrew McCarthy for synergy, or at least Duckie. Come on. With the hair, you know my only option was Spader. I'm starving. Oh, excuse me. Can we get some menus? Oh. Look who it is. I didn't know you worked here. Yeah, well, not all of us get to use Daddy's credit card. Look, we just wanted to order some food. I'm sorry. What time do you go on break? I wanted to time it out so that the fries are actually crispy. Oh. Um... Hey, I didn't recognize you. I... Dig the costumes. Thanks. Uh, Tory, this is Sam and Robby. Yeah, we've met already. Sam and I had a little run-in at the beach club. Oh. So, how do you two know each other? Tory's in Cobra Kai. Figures. What was that? Nothing. All right, I gotta get back to work. See you later, babe. Come on. Let's get some skates. I swear, she's sitting there tapping on her watch, like she's in frikking Knight Rider. "K.I.T.T., where the hell are you?" People now. I ditched the apps completely. Yeah, all this nerd technology messes with your head. It used to be simple. Like... ...this. Yeah. Like this. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Can you, uh, get me another? Sure. What about that girl you were telling me about? Yeah, I'm seeing her later tonight. Hmm. Mate, I'm telling you, you should see her apartment. She lives with her mum. Really? Way I see it, she's good for a few bangs and then I'll drop her. I mean, I'm not trying to be a dad to her kid or anything. Hey there, beautiful. Everything okay? Yeah. Okay, I'll admit, it's kinda weird running into your ex. Plus, that girl Tory is the worst. Remember what your dad says. "There's good in everyone." She just has to be shown the right way. But if you want to kick her ass, I won't stop you. Oh, no way. Oh, that's too perfect. I might have said something to the DJ. That is such a Duckie move. You're a Duckie in Spader clothing. Whoa, are you okay? Crap, my skate broke. Uh, I'll be right back. I'll come find you. Okay. ♪ If you leave  Don't leave now ♪ Please don't take  my heart away ♪ Hey. What do you want? I think my skates are too big. Look, about Tory... I can't believe you could be with a girl like that. You don't even know her. I know enough. Three hot dogs, two vanilla shakes and a Coke with extra ice. I should be the one that's pissed off. Here you are, making me think I'm a paranoid asshole and yet you're on a date with Robby? It's not a date. Not a date. Yeah. Heard that one before. Look, I just came to clear the air so that things wouldn't be weird. I guess that's a lost cause. Thanks. But I told him, "It better be a Harley or I'm not getting on." Yeah, I'm the same way. So, what kind of car do you drive anyway? I'm a Mustang kind of girl, so... Be right back, darling. I'll be right here. Bloody hell. America's falling apart. Hey, you wanna get some food? I know a good burger joint. I'm sorry. I have to go. What? Don't you want my number? Go on. Room for one more. Hey, man. I heard what you said about Carmen. If you gonna do that, just break it up with her, all right? Oh, you're the neighbor, aren't you? You fancy her, mate? Cheers for the advice. I've got some advice for you. Bugger off! No, no! You're lucky I'm showing mercy. This is mercy? Never go near Carmen again. Do you understand? Whatever you say. I'll ghost her. You'll what? I'll leave her alone, I'll disappear. Damn right you will. Mate. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Oh. Hey, Robby. Hey. So, I've gotten two compliments on my outfit. But everyone thinks I'm some guy named Dan Johnson. You ever heard of him? Uh, no. I'm sure whoever he is, he's cute. Are you okay? Oops. Sorry, princess. Sam! What the hell, Sam? What? Me... Are you okay, Tory? Thanks. All right, you're done. You're out. She's the one who started it. You're out. What is this? You shouldn't be working this late. Yeah, well, with Anoush gone, somebody has to review today's transactions. I want you to forget about that and I want you to remember something else. Sixteen years ago, grand opening party. Remember? Is this a sobriety test? Oh, come on, you remember. Play along. Our first big opening. Enjoy the party. Buy a car! Come with me. Where are we going? Come on. Oh, okay. Mmm. Here we go. What, you trying to torture me? Nah. Don't worry. It's sparkling cider. Ooh. Well, we're ditching our own grand opening party, we better be drinking to something good. How about, to finally having something that's ours? But what about this little one? What, her? No, no. She's mine. You can have the next one. Okay, to something that's ours. Mmm. How about some music? Mmm-hmm. Wow. You really prepared for this. You have no idea. Don't tell me this is the same cider. No way. This is the good stuff. ♪ You know our love  was meant to be ♪ So, this was the grand plan, huh? Trip down memory lane? It's not bad. It was a good night for the dealership. Forget the dealership. What I remember most about that night was sitting in the back seat of that car, just you and me mapping out our future. Look. I know I've been MIA the last few months. Part of it was Cobra Kai. Part of it was missing Mr. Miyagi. Opening up that dojo definitely made it feel like he was back in my life again. I know. And I don't want you to have to give that up. But I also know if he was here right now, he would tell me, "Forget about karate. "Focus on what's important." Oh, yeah? And what's that? ♪ In my heart  In my soul ♪ You're the meaning  in my life ♪ You're the inspiration ♪ You bring feeling to my life ♪ You're the inspiration ♪ Wanna have you near me ♪ I wanna have you  hear me sayin' ♪ Hi, Johnny. Hey, how you doing? I, uh, was supposed to go out with Graham, but looks like he stood me up. Oh. Forget about him. You don't deserve a loser like that. You deserve a guy that at least shows up. Anybody'd be lucky to go on a date with you. You asking me out? What if I am? So, how's Miguel's  training going? He's on the right path. You should be proud. He has this new girlfriend. I can't keep up with all the drama. I just don't understand  what Miguel sees in her. At least you both moved on, right? Yeah. Why don't you come over later?  It should be wild. Oh, come on. You gotta be kidding me. What the hell  is your problem? You, LaRusso.  You've been a major pain  in my ass all summer. Come on! Drink, drink, drink. Oh, I smell a rumble.
