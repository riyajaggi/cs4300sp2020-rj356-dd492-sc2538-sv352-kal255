 * I want it, I want it * Yo, Miguel, calm down, man. Save some for the tournament. Hey, don't even bother. He's been super aggro ever since the breakup. Well, where's sensei? The tournament's gonna start soon. - He'll be here. - I don't know about that. What are you talking about? I saw him last night at the mini mall. I was buying... A carton of milk. ert: When I heard him in the parking lot, yelling. nny: You want to be his father? Fine! Now who's pissed? Uh, Sensei? Everything all right? We're all gonna die, kid! We're all gonna die! Well, why didn't you tell us this earlier? I don't know. I guess I'm just so used to seeing him drunk, it didn't seem like that big a deal. Well, we're here, and he's not. So it's officially a big deal. What if something happened to him? - Like what? - I don't know. Like he drove his car off a cliff, or he bought a gun and blew his brains out. ha: No, sensei would never kill himself. It's too pussy a move. Whatever. I mean, we're here. We're gonna have to do it without him. nny: Do what without me? Sensei. We didn't think you were gonna show up. I may not always win, but I never back out of a fight. uel: Great. Let's sign up. ny: Not yet. There's one more lesson I have to teach you. an: All teams report to the locker room in five minutes. You've all learned to strike first, to be aggressive, not be losers. I've taught you to strike hard, put every ounce of your power behind everything you do. But I haven't taught you the third rule of Cobra Kai... No mercy. The older you get, the more you're gonna learn that life isn't fair. You wake up one morning feeling great, and then life throws a spinning heel kick to your balls. Takes a big steaming shit in your mouth. You get an F on a test. You get suspended. You fall in love with a girl, and some other dude comes and steals her away. Your car gets set on fire. Just when you think things are going good, everything falls apart. That's how it goes. Life shows no mercy, so neither do we. We do whatever it takes to keep our heads above water. We do whatever it takes to keep moving forward. We do whatever it takes to win! Remember who you are. You're badass. You don't give a shit. You kick ass. You're Cobra Kai. Cobra Kai! All right, guys, let's get down there and kick the shit out of everybody. Yeah! No. You're not wearing those. Man: Well, it's a good thing today is Sunday because it is gonna be sunny outside here in LA... So is this the plan for the whole day? 'Cause I was thinking maybe we could swing by the DMV or maybe a funeral. You know, put a little pep in our step. Come on, guys. So your boyfriend turned out to be a jerk. And your boyfriend turned out to be the son of your mortal enemy. You can't expect me to go to this tournament all by myself. You know how creeped out I get by karate moms. Nobody's making you go. LaRusso Auto Group is one of the main sponsors. One of us has to be there. You know what? Fine. Fine. I'm gonna be looking at boots on Zappos if anybody needs me. Man:  I'll go if you want to go. - I didn't say anything. - I know. I just know it's your thing. Not this year. Everyone I know is gonna be there. It is the 50th anniversary. Man: Please take your seats. The competition will begin shortly. Great turnout. I'm telling you, it's all about the blue mats. Yeah, I'm sure word really got around. We don't have to stay long. We'll just check out a few matches, and we'll hit the road, all right? ge: There he is. Hey, everyone, it's the former champion in the flesh. Good to see you, champ. Are you sure you don't want me to keep the car running? Go ahead. How are ya? Good to see you guys. Nice to see you. ryl: Welcome, everyone, to the 50th annual All Valley Under-18 Karate Championship! This has been going on for 50 years? Am I the only one that's been out of the loop? You love the new mats. All right, let's start by welcoming all the local dojos competing today. From Granada Hills, All-Star Karate... I'm so nervous. What if he gets hurt? What--what if he loses? How can you be so calm? ryl: Extreme Martial Arts... yl: We have Krunch Karate. Front row seats. The old man still has some pull, huh? Oh, hi, Patricia. You really went all out this year, huh? Well, you know, I want to support my baby. You know how it goes. Fighting out of Topanga, we have Topanga Karate! Yeah! Whoo, Topanga! You kick some ass, Xander! Whoo! Go, Xander. From Reseda, returning to the tournament, we have... nts: Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Huh! yl: Now that's what I call an entrance! And a badass name for a dojo. Let's hear it for Cobra Kai! Whoo! Go, Hawk! ryl: And finally, fighting unaffiliated from North Hills, we have Mr. Robby Keene. I didn't know he was fighting. - Neither did I. - ryl: All right, folks. Get ready. It's karate time. All right, gentlemen, you know the rules. Three points wins. - Step on the mat. - Wait, wait. And face me. Bow. Face each other. Bow. Ready? And fight! Point! Whoo! How did he do that? That's one point, Diaz. I can't believe he stole your move. Man: Fighting positions. And fight! One! an: That's two points, Keene! Enough defense. Attack! Yeah! Good job, Miss Robinson! Good job! Fight! Oh, damn, he is so hot. I cannot believe this actually works. Man: Fighting positions. - Let's go, Bert! No mercy! - Come on, Bert! nny: No mercy, Bert! Fight! Let's go, Bert! No mercy, Bert! - Aww! - Man: Three points! ryl: And that brings us to the quarterfinals. - Man: Three points! - Yes! Winner! Man: That's one more, Diaz! ryl: Over on Mat Two, Miguel Diaz makes the semis. Stop! Man: That's three points, Keene. Winner! ryl: Over on Mat Three, Robby Keene advances to the semifinals! - Stop! Point Robinson. - Nice! Yes, Aisha! 2-2. Ready? And fight! - Yes! - yl: And over on Mat Four, Xander Stone - is our last semifinalist. - Sorry. Eat shit, asshole. It was a good fight. - You'll get him next time. - Whatever. - I'll be right back. - Okay. ryl: Yes! Let's give it up for all of our competitors. You're all winners. We have seen some great fighting today, haven't we? Huh? You did a great job out there. You know, if he hadn't resorted to that sweep, you totally would have had him. I don't need your sympathy. ryl: There can be only one true winner, and he is standing on this stage right now. Will it be Miguel Diaz from Cobra Kai Karate? Whoo! Will it be Hawk... well, I guess it's just Hawk from Cobra Kai Karate? - ryl: Huh? - Moskowitz. It's Eli Moskowitz. Will it be Robby Keene, unaffiliated? And last but certainly not least, last year's champion, fighting out of Topanga Karate, Xander Stone! I love you, Xander! You're my boy. I just wanted to say, even though I love to fight, we all need to fight together against hatred. Look, I know this is probably the last thing you want to hear right now. But I'm really sorry. You're my oldest friend, and I never should have been hanging out with somebody like Yasmine in the first place. You got that right. All I know is, after that front wedgie, she's never gonna live that down. - You saw that? - It's all over YouTube. You really tore her a new... vagina? You know, I got to admit, this is a pretty cool gi. Thank you. I mean, the snake's a little on the evil side, but I like the colors. - I can probably get you one. - Yeah, right. My dad would have a heart attack. Well, even if you don't join Cobra Kai, we could definitely use another girl out there. der: And as I look around this arena, I pray for every race, religion, and gender that we can all live together in peace. Please join me in a moment of silence as we strive to end intolerance in our time. Hey, kick that pansy bitch in the face. Yes, Sensei. All right! First up, Stone versus Diaz! Let's go! Whoo! Go on, son! Punch him in the face, Xander! Use your hands! Come on! Focus, Diaz! Stop! There it is! Yeah, Miggy! That's 2-1, Diaz. cia: That's all right, baby. Two more, and mama is back in the finals! - You got it! - Offense! - Stay on offense! - Man: Ready positions. Ready, and fight! Focus, focus! - Let's go, Diaz. Don't let him trick you. - Come on, Diaz! - There it is! - Yeah! Man: Point! That is bullshit! - Bullshit! - And winner! Let's go! ryl: Miguel Diaz is headed to the finals. Next up, Hawk versus Keene. Oh, come on, you're not gonna cheer for your own student? No, he's not my student. I--Amanda, I can't. The kid lied to me. So he lied. So what? He's a kid, who obviously wasn't in it with Johnny, or he wouldn't be fighting his students. Man: Okay, come on! Man: Yeah! Something wrong, Sensei? No. Show him what you got. Whoo! Prepare to face the fury of the Hawk. Man: Face me. Bow. Face each other. Bow. Fighting positions. Ready? And fight! Man: Point! an: One point, Hawk. He's not focused. Remember what you learned, Robby! You got to search inside for the good stuff, you know, and just... Because then you can find some balance in your life. It's not easy, but you'll do it. Man: Okay, fighting positions. Ready? And fight! Stop! Yeah! There you go, Robby! Aw, that was sick. - That's great, huh? - One point, Keene. That was a lucky point. It's gonna be your last. Why? You leaving early to fix that stupid haircut? Hey! - Stop! Get back here! - Hey, hey! - What the hell is that? - Robby! That's enough! Illegal contact. You're disqualified. Bullshit! - Are you okay? - Get the hell away from me. Hey, back on your side. What the hell are you thinking, man? What was I supposed to do, be a pussy? You all right, kid? bby: I'm fine. ryl: With that disqualification, Keene earns a trip to the finals. We'll see him back here after a short break. You remembered to focus. You had me up on that tree for hours. Look, Robby, your dad and I, we have our issues, but... you and him? That's another story. I'm sorry I lied to you, Mr. LaRusso. I just wanted to get back at him. I know. But you're never gonna find balance that way. You can't let that bad blood change who you are. I'm not saying you need to like the guy. I know I never will, but... he--he is your father. And believe me, you're lucky to have one. You just got to try to remember, he's--he's not a monster. He's just a guy with a lot of demons. Mr. Miyagi always told me there's no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher. And your dad had the worst teacher there ever was. It sent him down a wrong path. But you don't have to go down that path. Do you understand? You don't have to ever become...him. Trust me. You let go of all that anger, and I guarantee you, no matter what happens tonight, you go home feeling great. I don't know about that. My shoulder's killing me. I... I don't think I can fight. Well, we'll see about that. Medic! Is there a medic? Man: The final match will begin shortly. Sam. Hey, I'll see you later. Look, I'm sorry about what happened the other night. You mean when you hit me? It was an accident. I wasn't trying to hit you. You shouldn't have been trying to hit anyone. You--you bring some dude to the party the other night and expect me to be okay with that? I expect you to act like a normal person. You don't even know Robby, and you were trying to start a fight with him? You have to strike first. You don't wait for the enemy to attack. The enemy? Do you even hear yourself? I don't even know who you are anymore. Well, just wait. Watch what I do to Robby in the finals. Hey, Mom? I really need to go, but, um, I can Uber. No. No, baby, I'll come with you. It's okay. We'll, uh--we'll just text your dad on the way. Come on, Anthony, we got to go. It's just starting to get good. Are you feeling any pain here? Uh, yeah. Does it hurt when I do this? - Yeah. - Okay, are you ready? I'm sorry. It's a slight anterior dislocation, so I just popped it back into place, but you're gonna feel it for the next few weeks. Okay, thanks, Doctor. Appreciate it. Sure. Listen, you don't need to fight. Yes, I do. I'm gonna have to face him sooner or later. Might as well be today. This is it, folks. The moment we've all been waiting for. The final match to determine who will be victor and champion. Will it be Miguel Diaz from Cobra Kai Karate? That's my son! Will it be Robby Keene, unaffili-- Daniel LaRusso's gonna coach? Daniel LaRusso is gonna coach! ryl: I'm sorry, folks, there's been a change. Robby Keene will now be fighting for Miyagi-Do Karate with former champion Daniel LaRusso as his sensei! How about that? Good luck, gentlemen. What do you think you're doing? Coaching my student. Somebody needs to be there for him. - You think this is funny? - Do you see me laughing? You're gonna regret this when it's over. Yeah, right. Like this'll ever be over. All right, senseis, let's take your corners. Remember, no aggression. Just let him come to you. - All right? - Okay. You know what to do. You've trained all year for this. Don't worry, Sensei. I won't let LaRusso or that kid go home a winner. Face me. Bow. Each other. Bow. Fighting positions. Ready? And fight! Hiyah! And stop! Man: Point! ryl: Keene and Miyagi-Do get the first point. One point. sha: No mercy! - Man: You got it! - Positions. Remember the pitching machine. Don't get hit. Man: Ready? And fight! Stop! - One point. - Yeah! ryl: Diaz and Cobra Kai with the point. Now it's 1-1. Ready? And...fight! - Man: Point! - Yeah! ryl: That makes it two points for Diaz. Time! Time. Time? Hey. You all right? All right, listen to me. Listen to me. Look at me. Just remember to breathe and focus. All right, you hear me? Just... find your balance. Man: All right, Keene, are you ready? Can you continue? Yeah. - All right. - Man: All right, Diaz. Let's go. Man: Fighting positions. Yeah! Come on, Robby! And fight! Stop! Out of bounds. Out of bounds. No point. Out of bounds. All right, let's go, Robby. Stay focused. Ready? And fight! ryl: How about that? A two-legged kick. sha: Come on! Hey. - Watch it, Diaz! - Yeah! Ref! Come on! Man: That's one warning for unsportsmanlike contact. - Man: Fight! - No mercy. Hiyah! Man: Warning for illegal contact to the knee. Robby, come here. - I'm gonna tell him to end it. - No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no, let me finish. Okay, just-- be careful. I found his weakness, Sensei. It's his shoulder. Look, I know we want to win, but it's got to be the right way. We don't have to fight dirty. Dirty? There's nothing dirty about winning, Sensei. You taught me that. Don't worry. I got this. No mercy. ryl: Whoever wins the next point will be our new champion! It's 2-2. Next point wins. Man: Okay, good luck to both of you. - Come on, Miguel! - Ready? And fight! Hiyah! Man: Stop! Point! Winner! Oh, my God, Miguel! Yes, yes! - nny: Robby. Robby! - Let's go! Sensei, we did it! ryl: Who saw that coming, ah? I know I didn't. Without further ado, let me present the trophy to this year's new champion, Miguel Diaz and the Cobra Kai dojo! Yeah! Miguel! Is there anything you want to say to the people, son? I just want to say that if it wasn't for my sensei, I wouldn't be here, so this is for Sensei Johnny Lawrence and Cobra Kai! Yeah! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Cobra Kai! Robby. I... I'm--I'm sorry. It's okay, Dad. It's okay. Let's go, Mr. LaRusso. You got what you wanted, Johnny. You won. Congratulations. You were amazing. - Thanks, Ma. - Hey, nice job. Miggy. Miggy! Are you okay? Uh, yes, Mom. Just, um, looking for someone, okay? - One minute. - Hey, man! There he is! Listen. I'm reconsidering joining Cobra Kai. I'm still not into the idea of getting hit in the face and all, but... I respect the safety-in-numbers aspect of joining a gang. Uh, have you-- have you seen Sam? Oh, yeah. Pretty sure she left a while ago. Okay. Well, hey, great job not sucking. Thanks, man. Oh, man. Hiyah! Second place. I came so close. Yeah, well, you fought with honor, and he didn't, so no matter what that trophy says, you're the real winner. You should be proud of yourself. I know I am. Thanks. I'm sure my dad's happy too. Now Cobra Kai's gonna take over karate in the valley. Yeah. Right. Over my dead body. Where are we going? Come on. Whose cars are these? Don't worry about it. Just follow me. This where you bury your bodies or something? I know I said you have to let go of your anger and show forgiveness, but... when the fight comes to you, you have to be ready to fight back. And to do that, we'll need more students. Welcome to Miyagi-Do Karate. Miguel? Congratulations. You did what I always thought you could do. You won. Cobra Kai is back where it belongs. Back on top. Everyone closed the book on us. They thought we were done. But now they see... That the real story's only just begun.
