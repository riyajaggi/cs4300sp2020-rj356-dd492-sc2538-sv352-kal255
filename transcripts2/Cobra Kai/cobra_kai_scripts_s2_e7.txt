 Good morning, baby. Good morning, sunshine. Hey, did you go to the dealership already? Uh, no, I'm at the dojo. I wanna get an early jump on today's lesson plan. Right, yeah, that sounds important. Are you still coming in?  We have that lunch  with Anoush. That's today? Yeah. Look, Daniel, he isn't happy. He's been doing a lot for us.  Not to mention getting  punched in the stomach.

 All right, no problem. It's gonna be a light day.  I'll be there. Don't worry, all right? I love you. Robby? I guess the early bird catches the worm... It's a cute little place you got here. You teach karate, or gardening? So, this is what it comes to? Breaking and entering? I'm just here to say thank you. Thank me for what? Well, taking our weakest soldiers from our ranks. That was kind. Soldiers...

 They're kids. We were all kids, once. You may think you got the best of Johnny Lawrence. But I promise you, this time, I won't let him lose. Lose what? This isn't war. Sure it is. War never ends. Peace is just the lull between battles. Did you really think you can attack Cobra Kai and there wouldn't be any consequences? You better hope that your students are ready. Because I promise you, ours will be. Regards to Mr. Miyagi. It's good. It has fresh acai, organic kale, and free trade hemp oil. Hemp oil? I mean, this isn't gonna get me high, is it? I don't think so. It's supposed to balance your kinetic energy. I'm really glad you called. I missed hanging out with you. So, which one do you like better? I've been wearing the white top a lot. Well, why does it matter? You're just gonna get all sweaty. Wait... Do you have a crush? I don't have a crush. Is it Robby? Oh, my God! How long have you guys been... We haven't. We almost. Does Miguel know? There's nothing to know. It's crazy. After last year, I got back into karate to get away from all the drama. Well, my mom's therapist always says, "You can't hide from your heart." I think you should wear the blue one. It goes with your eyes. All right. Now, shoes. Hey, Sensei, I'm sorry about your loss. Thanks. So, how was the funeral? As good as any funeral can be. Yeah... So, how'd it go around here while I was gone? Great. I mean, Sensei Kreese is tough, but, uh, he knows what it takes to win. Who moved my stuff? What the hell happened here? Well, I spent some time organizing the place. Bills were unpaid and invoices were backed up. The military man in me couldn't resist. You've been making yourself right at home, huh? A buddy of mine took that photo. Yeah, it's nice. I got a class to run. Everybody get your gis on. Training starts in five minutes. Gis? What? Yeah, what's wrong? Nothing is wrong. I just thought we were going to the woods for a special training today. What's happening in the woods? I thought it was a good time to separate the men from the boys. And the girls, too, I suppose. How? Coyote Creek. I'm not sure they're ready for that. There's only one way to find out. We're ready, Sensei. We want to prove ourselves. It's up to Sensei Lawrence. If he says it's okay, then, and only then, is it okay. All right, what are you waiting for? Let's go. Oh, God! It's so hot out. I'm sweating in places I didn't even know I had pores. What have I gotten them into? All right, guys. Get out from under that tree. It's time to get to work. Hey, Mr. LaRusso, it's like 100 degrees out. Can we take it easy today? Are you kidding? This heatwave is a gift. Today, you are going to experience Shochu-Geiko. Like the car insurance? Shochu-Geiko is a Japanese exercise where you train during the hottest days of the year. It's about pushing yourself to your limit. The fight isn't always going to come when it's 75 degrees and breezy. Aren't we supposed to avoid fighting? Sometimes, you can't. Someday, the fight may come to you. And I wanna make sure you're ready. So, today, we're gonna see what Miyagi-Do is made of. Gentlemen, ladies. Welcome to Coyote Creek. You've been split into two teams. Red... And black. The goal is to capture as many headbands as possible from the other side. Today, the people across from you are not your friends. They're not your brothers. They are the enemy. The last team standing wins. How do we get the headbands? By any means possible. No rules. Use your judgement. This is just a training exercise. Correct, but remember, this is your life. You lose it, you die. Hey, guys, sorry I'm late. Traffic on the 118 was a real bitch. Put Coyote Creek into the nav. Nothing came up. What have you done to yourself? Oh, the... Yeah, you know what, I just decided to flip the script, Hawk-style. Respect. Heretofore, you can refer to me as Stingray. Yeah, all right, Chubs. He's in your team. Terrific. Two... Five. Got you. All right, Demetri's turn. Come on. Demetri, get in there. Set. Three. Sorry, Meat. You gotta block that. Six. I hate this. All right, come on, get up. Can we please take a break? This heat is brutal. You guys wanna cool off? Mmm-hmm. All right. I think I can accommodate that. So, what happens at the end of this if it's just you and me? Then I guess I'll have to rip that pretty little head band off your head. Yeah, this headband is staying right where it is. Oh, shit. He's all yours. Nah. Ladies first. Thanks. No hard feelings. No mercy. So, you couldn't take the heat of Shochu-Geiko, perhaps, you'll find Kangeiko more to your liking. Are there are no "geikos" that takes place in a spa? No, it's not about the heat or the cold. It's about adapting to the environment around you and using that to your advantage. Look around, what do you see? Frozen London broil. No, not the meat, look past that. I see the exhalation of breath. The twitch of a muscle. The shift of a stance. If you lean into the cold, it will heighten your senses. And then you'll anticipate the moment before your opponent strikes. And you'll always be ready. Yeah. All right, circle up. Was that Daniel? Yeah, he's not coming. Hey, you've reached  Daniel LaRusso. Sorry I can't come to the... What the hell, man? Sorry, ass-face. Today, you're the enemy. That makes five kills. Guess I earned my Medal of Honor. Seven. That's what I'm talking about. Five. All right. Let's get Demetri in there. Good job. All right, here goes nothing. Literally. Set. Six. Come on, Demetri. Look for the signs. Anticipate, you can do this. All right, focus. Come on, Demetri. Oh, you, come on. Just give me a second. It's all right, Miss Robinson, you'll get them next time. They got you out, too? Yeah. I guess there's just Hawk and Miguel left. I can't do it, Mr. LaRusso. Between the cold and the shouting and the hole in my sock... I'm not sure when that happened, but it's real uncomfortable. Demetri, you are the most neurotic person that I know. You always expect the worst. But you could use that to your advantage. It means you anticipate. Think of it like a Spidey-Sense. Actually, in the comics, they call it, "Spider-Sense." Look, Demetri, this isn't about who's fastest and who's strongest. This is about instincts. It's about using what's in here. You think you could do that? All right. Let's try it again. Remember, anticipate. Two. Whoo! I did it! Five. Okay, that's okay. Baby steps. Baby steps, right? Yeah. Mmm-hmm. Good job, bro. Good job. Nice. Is everything okay, Dad? Yeah, yeah. Um, I'll meet you at home. That's all for today, guys. Great job. Finally, a worthy opponent. So, you're the one that trashed Miyagi-Do? They're the enemy. I had to put them in their place. So, that means you had to trash their dojo, and steal their Medal of Honor? What do you care? Just 'cause you still have a thing for Sam doesn't mean I have to go soft. I'm not soft. And this isn't about her. Nah, sure it isn't. You want the medal so bad, come and take it. Is that Miguel and Hawk? Is that all you got? That's all I've got. Finish him. Team Black! Yeah! Looks like that champ of yours is developing a real killer instinct. You know, the thing about stingrays is, they lie in wait for the perfect opportunity to strike! The red team just won! Whoo! Yeah! Good work, Stingray. Thank you, Sensei. What was that? That's not how I taught you to fight. It's what Sensei Kreese taught us. This isn't a tournament, this is real life. Is that how you wanna live your life? I like what you've done with the place. It's very "home dojo chic." Thanks. So, what did you like better today? The heat or the cold? You know, they both have their pluses and minuses. But if I had to pick one, I'd say room temp. That wasn't an option. What about you? I like the heat. I thought we weren't. We weren't... He left. Oh, I was gonna buy him surf n' turf at Delmonico's. I'll call his cell. No, Daniel, he quit. Anoush gave his notice. What? Tom Cole offered him a higher title. Better money. He was gonna give us a chance to match it, but then you bailed on him. Okay, I know, all right. Listen, this is an easy fix. I'll call Anoush and I'll clear it up. This isn't about Anoush. This is about you not being able to keep your promises. You said you would be able to balance everything and now look where we are. Today got away from me, okay? It's not gonna happen again, I promise, I'll be at the dealership more. You're not getting it, Daniel. I'm not talking about the dealership, I'm talking about us. Ever since you opened Miyagi-Do, I've been waking up in an empty bed. I've been running this business all by myself. I have spent the entire summer feeling alone, while you're off at karate camp. I'm sorry, okay? I've just been focused on giving these kids a chance to defend themselves. Well, sometimes, when you focus on one thing, you lose focus of everything else that matters. Sam, someone's at the door. Sam? What are you doing here? I'm not here to fight. I just came to give something back. I knew you took it. No, look, I had nothing to do with that or what happened to your dojo. We're not all assholes. Just tell Sam I said sorry. Who was that? Nobody. Had the wrong house. Weird. Well, I'm headed to bed. It's been a day. Yeah. It has. Ah. Hey, Johnny. You come to congratulate me on my victory? We need to talk. About what? About what you've been putting in my kids' heads since I've been gone. Well, just been teaching them the way of the fist. The same lessons I taught you. Strike first, strike hard. No mercy. Yeah, that's where we have a problem. Oh, do we? Yeah. Cobra Kai needs to change. What you taught didn't work back then, and it doesn't work now. What, do you wanna change it to, something nice and snuggly, like a blanket? No. Cobra Kai will always be badass. But there's a difference between no mercy and no honor. Ah... Honor? Let me tell you something. When you're in a war, the other side never fights with any honor. Take it from me, I know. Trust me, I've been there. Be glad that you don't know. Yeah, I don't know what "shit" you went through back then, but these are good kids, and they don't need to relive our mistakes. The only mistake is teaching them weakness. Like what you did when you backed down from LaRusso's challenge. Is that what the new Cobra Kai is all about? If you're trying to get me riled up, it's not gonna work. I'm responsible for these students. And I am responsible for you. You are still my student. I'm worried about you, Johnny. I see what's gonna happen. You're gonna let your guard down. And that's gonna leave you vulnerable. All right, maybe that's what you think... But this is my dojo, and I make the rules. Your dojo? You forget who started Cobra Kai? I haven't forgotten anything. You know what? I'm sorry. I thought this could work, but I was wrong. Look... We're done! I don't ever wanna see you in this dojo again. Today, we'll be  learning one of the most important lessons a Cobra Kai could know. Bugger off. Headbutting. This is me trying to help. What else can I do, Amanda? You might wanna work on that, so, you can get off the couch. If you wanted to, I could set you up on an app. That's how my mom  found her boyfriend. If you like her,  just swipe right, and we'll  set up a bunch of dates. We combat all institutions of oppression. Climate change, denial, the patriarchy. I hate the Patriots, too.
