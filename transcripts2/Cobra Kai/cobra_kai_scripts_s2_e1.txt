 Miguel? Congratulations. You did what I always thought you could do. You won. Cobra Kai's back where it belongs. Back on top. Everyone closed the book on us. They thought we were done. But now they see... that the real story's only just begun. I thought you were dead.

 You ain't the only one, kid. I've been away a long, long time. It's good to see you. Still got that hot temper, huh? But I like that. I like that. I bet that's why your student is now the champion. You trained him well. Just like I trained you. You forgot. I taught you everything you know. Not everything. Not bad, Mr. Lawrence. Not bad. Look, I don't want to fight.

 I just want to talk. About what? How you taught me to fight dirty? How you broke my second-place trophy? How you tried to kill me? I never tried to kill you. Go to hell, you son of a... How does  second place feel now, huh? Now who's the loser? Hey... Hey, come on! Let him go! Come on, he can't breathe! You're gonna kill him! Showing mercy to an old man. That's very honorable. And stupid. Whoa. Mr. Miyagi gave you this? Yep. Best birthday gift ever. Haven't had much of a chance to get down here lately to take care of her the way she deserves. Something tells me there's a can of wax in my future. Don't worry. We got plenty to do before that. Make bigger circles. Yeah, bigger. And remember, breathe in, breathe out. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. Slide yours back a little more. A little bit... It's gotta be perfectly balanced. See that? Hey. Hey. The workman returns. I gotta tell you, it feels great to get my hands dirty again. Hey, where's Sam? She's upstairs. Still pretty torn up over her break-up with Miguel. Mr. Cheapshot? I hate to say I told her so, but I told her so. Daniel. What? I'm supposed to be upset that my daughter has broken up with Cobra Kai's top bully? I'm with Dad on this one. Thank you, Anthony. Hey, you know what? Why don't you join Team Miyagi-Do this summer? You could train with Robby. Is it still chores or is there any actual karate? Now, chores are part of it. If you start with different... I'll stick with camp. Hey, babe. I just want to make sure you're not biting off too much, okay? I'm happy that you found karate again, but opening your own dojo? Make sure you can balance that with everything you got going on? Balance is my thing. Listen, I don't want Sam and Anthony going to school with a bunch of kids who think you can cheat and get away with it. You can't let the bullies win. Someone has to do something. Yeah, but why does it have to be you? Because I know how to beat Cobra Kai. I did it 30 years ago. And I can do it again. Twenty to the ten. Touchdown, Hogan! What a play by Hogan! He managed to get the ball... Congratulations, Sensei. Thanks. Wanna come in? Mmm. It's really good. What's it called again? Tres Leches. Tres Leches. It means "three milks." It's better than the milk I used to drink. Miguel's lucky. In more ways than one. You know, when we first moved here, Miggy was having a pretty tough time. I never imagined a few months later, there would be an arena full of people cheering him on. But, um... To be honest, there were some moments I wasn't sure I liked what I saw. He had this look on his face. But that's just his, um... What do they call it? His game face? Right? Don't worry. Miguel's a good kid. I won't let him go astray. One sec. Hello. Hear me out.  Smitty's Diner, 8:00 a.m. They had a wrong number. So you might be wondering what a team does after they win  the championship. The answer? Victory nachos! It was supposed to be a round of drinks, but the waitress was not feeling Hawk's fake ID. Hey, don't talk about that. My parents follow you. Sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Moskowitz. Anyways, until next time, no mercy, bitches. I gotta say, it's nice to be at a victory party. Yeah, except you had nothing to do with the victory. Well, then I consider it a belated party for the coding competition we won at computer camp. Remember? Cool it with the nerd shit, huh? Hey, where's Miguel? His wings are getting cold. There you are. This is how you celebrate a first-place trophy? She blocked me. So, what happens when you get blocked? You counter-punch. Except maybe don't actually hit her this time. What, too soon? Look, all I'm saying is don't give up. It's no use. I blew any shot I had with her. Just give Sam some time. She'll come around. Or she won't. You're the champ now. You can get any chick in the Valley you want. You're like Drake. Enjoy it. I'm not sure I wanna be Drake. Don't worry, you're not. Thanks for coming. Let's make this fast. You know what you want? I'm not hungry. How's the corned beef hash? It's fine. I'll have it well done. And bring me a cup of Sanka. Red-hot, just like you, doll-face. Right. Mmm! Reminds of a girl I knew in Panama. Spent some time down there in '89, helping the Delta boys get that son of a bitch Noriega. What the hell do you want? Are you familiar with brumation? In the winter, some animals bury themselves in a hole and sleep there for months. It's called hibernation. No. That's for warm-blooded creatures. For the cold-blooded like snakes, it's brumation. The snake buries himself in a hole. The only difference is, the snake doesn't sleep. He stays awake all winter, waiting for the right moment to emerge. And that moment is now. Oh, is it? Kid, I've been all over the world. After Cobra Kai shut down, I knew I had to keep fighting to stay alive. So I re-enlisted. I ran strikes in Desert Storm, I trained SEALs in Afghanistan. All off the books. Buried, waiting. But when I climbed out of my hole, the world wasn't the same. Our society has gotten weak. Kids today are coddled. They get trophies just for showing up. Something's got to be done. Someone's got to step in and stop the ass-kissing and start the ass-kicking. That's why we're here. The world needs Cobra Kai. That's a nice little speech. The only problem is, there is no "we." I'm just saying, I can help you. I don't need your help. You might not think you do, but those students... Stay away from my students, you understand? You ruined my life. Johnny, we've had disagreements. But ruined your life? Come on. You had no life before you met me. Remember? Yeah. Yeah, I remember. I remember you doing back then what you're doing right now. Trying to find my weakness. But I'm not a kid anymore. And you're not my sensei. There's only one sensei in Cobra Kai. Me. And that's how it's gonna stay. You're right. The world may need Cobra Kai, but we don't need you. Hey. Be careful. That drum saved my life. Sorry, I didn't mean to touch it. Nah, it's just a toy. Then again, not everything in Miyagi-Do is always as it seems. That's the Medal of Honor. The highest honor awarded by the US Military. I didn't know Mr. Miyagi was a war hero. Yes, he was. Guess it wasn't all bonsais and kata. What are these? I'm glad you asked. First rule of Miyagi-Do Karate, "Karate is for defense only." Second rule of Miyagi-Do Karate... "First, learn rule number one." It's really all about that first rule. I guess Mr. Miyagi would make an exception for Cobra Kai. I mean, when my dad finds out what we're up to, he is not gonna know what hit him. All right. So I get my license next week. Uh-huh. My mom's going to give me her Sentra. I'm thinking about putting a blue racing stripe down the middle, hood to tail. Subtle, I like it. Looks like we got some new students. Fresh fish. It's the champs. Check this out. Don't. Hey, mouth-breathers, move it. Sorry about that. I'll get the door. So you guys wanna be Cobra Kais, huh? You got a long road ahead of you. Why'd you do that? I didn't do anything. What? What the hell happened here? Looks like Sensei threw a party. Must've been pretty sick if fire got involved. Look how much glass there is. I wonder why he didn't invite us? Quiet! The dojo's closed to new students today. We just wanted to sign up after we saw the tournament. Do I need to say it again? Get out. Yes, sir. Sensei. Come on, let's go. Let's go, move it. Come back tomorrow. And bring your checkbooks. Everyone, fall in. Must've been a rager, Sensei. Yeah, were you celebrating all weekend? Celebrating what? My students are a bunch of pussies. Diaz, Hawk, up front. Hawk. Did you attack your opponent when his back was turned? Yes, Sensei. Diaz. Did you purposely attack your opponent's injury? Yes, Sensei. You think that makes you badass? What's the matter, too tough a question? Maybe you need some help. Ms. Robinson. Yes, Sensei. Two cobras in the jungle. One kills the strongest lion. The other kills a crippled monkey. Which cobra do you wanna be? The one that kills the lion, Sensei. And why is that? Because it killed a stronger animal. Correct. Cobra Kai is about being badass. And the baddest badass is the one who beats his opponent when he's at his strongest. Not when his back is turned, not when he's injured. Is that understood? Yes, Sensei. That means no more cheating. No more fighting dirty. From here on out, those are pussy moves, and you don't wanna be pussies, do you? No, Sensei. Good. It's why I had you wear white belts, we're starting over. Diaz, Hawk, 50 push-ups on your knuckles. Ms. Robinson, warm them up. Yes, Sensei. Fighting position. Jab punch, ready. Sensei, can I talk to you about something? What do you want? What was that out there? Punishing us for winning the tournament? I'm teaching you a lesson. Yeah, well, what about "No mercy"? You taught us to win at all costs. Yeah... Well, maybe I'm still learning a bit, too. I just don't understand. You had no problem with us attacking anyone else. Why take pity on Robby Keene? Look, I wasn't taught the difference between mercy and honor, and I paid the price for it. If I'm extra hard on you, it's only because you have the potential to be better than I ever was. You want that, don't you? Yes, Sensei. All right. Then stop whining like a little bitch and get out and finish your drills. Yeah, screw you, too, Bert. Hey, what are you doing here? You finally change your mind and decide to join the Cobras? We still need another girl. Yeah, right. Um, I was actually coming to see if you wanted to hang out. I was thinking we could go on a hike or we could go to the beach club? I'd love to, but the guys and I have to go to Hawk's house to watch some movie called  Over the Top. Sensei said we have to be ready to discuss, so... Do you wanna come with? Uh, yeah, I was sort of thinking it would maybe just be you and me. Well, maybe you could just come. It would be good for you guys to talk. Air things out. I'm gonna take a rain check. Okay. I'm sorry. See you. See you later. Attention,  plumbing department. There's a customer  waiting in aisle 12. Hey, man. Hey. I'm looking to replace a 4x8 piece of mirror. Metallica. Noice. Rock on, man. Rock on indeed, man. The '80s were the best era ever. The best era ever. Right? I mean, I was only like five years old when it happened, but still. You remember Caddyshack? Yeah, sure. Yeah, you remember the gopher who used to dance? Whatever the noise was. Hey, my question, is that a real gopher that they got to do that or is that like something they did with... I don't know. I was partying with babes back then. Do you have the mirror glass or not? Oh, yeah. God. Definitely. Just, uh... I'll be right back. All right. Thank you. Hey, Mr. LaRusso, uh, it's over here. Nah, that's a deck screw. I mean, we could use that to hang the shelf, but then the screw will be doing all the work. Eventually, it would give out under all this weight. What we really need is a toggle bolt. Yeah, take two of those. It's not as big. No, it's not. But it's got a little secret. See this spring? Once it goes through the wood, it opens up and uses the whole wall to support the shelf. Wait, let me get the lesson here. You're saying that in life, I can't do everything by myself and I have to rely on other people? No, I was just teaching you about shelving. But if you can ring a metaphor out of that, you're a better student than I ever was. Hey, Metallica man. We got that, uh, mirror glass all set for you. So just, uh, come on up front and pay for it. Johnny. Whoa! LaRusso Auto? Chopping prices. I love that commercial. I love karate, too. I mean, I never got to do it. My mom wouldn't let me, so... Hey, you look just like him. Is this your son? What's going on? My name's Raymond. Hey, man. Put the glass on the loading dock. Give me a second. Oh, for sure. What are you guys doing here? Just working on a little project. That's all. You? Same. Hey, give me those. I'll, uh, go pay. Meet you by the car. How's your shoulder? Getting better. No thanks to you. Look, I know you're pissed at me. You have a right to be. But I'm trying to change. Sure. I don't want there to be bad blood between us. Yeah, well, you kinda ruined that when you told Diaz to fight dirty against me. I didn't tell Miguel to fight dirty against you. Look... I know I'm supposed to forgive you or whatever, but right now, it's a little tough. So instead you're gonna torture me by training with that prick? Hey, you don't know Mr. LaRusso. He is a better man than you will ever be. How'd it go back there? Same way it always goes. Cares more about his rivalry with you than he does about me. Not bad. Just remember, that drop down back kick may be powerful, but you're leaving yourself vulnerable to attack. Hey, Dad. I didn't know you ever came in here anymore. Just working some stuff out. Listen, I've been so busy building this dojo. I know you and I haven't had a chance to really talk about you and Miguel. I don't wanna talk about it, Dad. Did I ever tell you about my first girlfriend? I was about your age. She was in another league. Beautiful eyes, amazing smile. And I thought it would last forever. I did. What happened? Grandma moved us out of New Jersey. Came to California, I met a new girl, Ali. This time, I was sure she was the one. I mean, Judy was great, but this, this was true love. So what happened with Ali? That's a story for another time. And then there's a story after that one. And that one. My point is, Sam, you think the world revolves around one person, but then, you meet someone new. I know it's hard. It hurts, but everyone goes through this. Yeah, but not everyone has an insane karate cult that's brainwashing half the school. Well, that's why I'm opening up Miyagi-Do. So we can fight back, take down Cobra Kai. I don't wanna fight them. They're not my enemies, they're my friends. At least they used to be. Thanks for trying to help, Dad. Oh, I bet you think you did a pretty good job, Mr. Lawrence. But just because I gave you that blue belt doesn't mean anything. You hear me? Yes, Sensei. Are those tears, Mr. Lawrence? What's the matter? Can't you handle the way I speak? No, Sensei, it's my stepdad. He's... Let me tell you something. The moment those tears leave your eyes, you lose. And I don't teach losers. Do you understand, Mr. Lawrence? Yes, Sensei. I can't hear you. Yes, Sensei! Then what are you? I'm a winner, Sensei. Louder! I'm a winner! Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you. Oh, it's okay. What kind of kata was that? It's not a kata. It's a form of meditation Mr. Miyagi taught me to use whenever I lose focus. You lost focus? Not anymore. Ever since the tournament, all I've been thinking about are ways to destroy Cobra Kai. And now you have the answer? Yes. The answer is, we won't. Cobra Kai isn't the enemy. There are no enemies. Your dad, his students, they're just like you and me. They've just been taught the wrong way. The goal of Miyagi-Do Karate isn't to fight them, it's to show them a different way. Right? A better way. For them and everyone in the Valley. You got room for one more? Yeah. The place looks great. I mean, the house has been painted and the deck's been sanded. Does that mean I'm off the hook? Uh, no, we're gonna find something for you to do. Get on over here. All right. Not even open 24 hours, and I've doubled my roster. I've got a good feeling about this. All right, you guys should both get some rest, because this summer, you're gonna be spending a lot of time back here together. I just wanna say one thing, and then I'll leave. Yeah, what is it? I'm sorry. I realized that I was too hard on you. You were young, and I went overboard. You were my best student. You had so much potential. I just couldn't stand seeing you lose. I know I could be a tough son of a bitch, but if you'd seen some of the things that I've seen... Well, that doesn't change what I did. For years, I've regretted that night. But when I heard that you brought back Cobra Kai, I thought maybe this could be a shot for me to redeem myself. 'Cause believe me, there ain't nothing I'd like more in this world than to have another chance. I understand if you never want to see me again. But just remember, I am the guy who always rooted for you. Uh... I almost forgot. I fixed it for you. It may say second place, but in my opinion, you were always the better fighter. See you, kid. Hold up. You think winning the All Valley gives you the right to goof off? A true champion never stops training. You all know  I'm no fan of LaRusso. Come on. To be a great fighter, you gotta learn to adapt. Time to see what you're made of. Mr. Miyagi  was such a great teacher. I just wish I was a natural  at teaching karate. You don't have to be Mr. Miyagi. You just have to be Mr. LaRusso. Class, this is Mr. Kreese. The fight is only over when you say it is. I'm a little worried about Mr. Kreese. The guy's got his issues. But everyone deserves  a second chance. We need to amp  things up now that  John Kreese is back. This man sounds like a real jerk. He's been a thorn in my side since high school. I just want to finish this. And I know exactly  what I'm going to do. Oh, I smell a rumble. Some people have it good. But the rest of us, we have to fight for every inch that's ours. For everything. What are you doing here? In the real world, it's not about scoring points. Where's Robby? We'll make you  part of this family. Last team standing wins. What the hell do you think you're doing? Like you don't know. You know I'm not gonna strike first.
