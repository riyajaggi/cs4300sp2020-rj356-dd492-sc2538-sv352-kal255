 Last night was fun. We've gotta do that more often. Definitely. You don't think the kids heard us, do you? Well, they didn't hear me. Oh, stop it. Hey, Sam, good... Where is she? Hey, Anthony. Have you seen your sister? Not since yesterday, when I got home from camp.

 Can you make me waffles? Not the frozen kind, the ones you make from scratch. Hey, it's Sam, leave a message. It still keeps going to her voicemail. Robby's not picking up either. You think they're together? Well, they are teenagers who have been living together all summer. No way, I'm not ready to go there. You know, I... Trusted Robby. Sam better be okay. Ugh. You need a password. What? Don't look at me like that. Now is not the time. Why would she ask if she's okay?

 She was drinking? "The cops"? What are you doing? I should have thought of this sooner. Find my iPhone. Here it is. She's somewhere between Sherman Way and Saticoy? Well, what is she doing in Reseda? Another new update? I just got this. Hey. Thanks for letting us crash here last night. It's no problem. But, look, I'm gonna have to tell LaRusso about this. It's his kid. Look, please don't. If he sees her like this, it'll crush him. Let me take the blame. I'll say I got drunk and told Sam to bring me here. Should be right here. What the hell? Johnny? Oh, no. Johnny, come on, I saw your car outside. I know you're in there, open up. All right, go in the other room, I got your back. Johnny! Hey, man. Is my daughter here? Yeah, just calm down. Don't tell me to calm down, all right? Where is she? Look, they had a crazy night. Kids do these things. Just don't overreact. Okay. Who the hell are you to tell me about parenting? You need to open this door right now. Hey! I don't need to do anything until you cool off. Sam! What the hell is wrong with you? Fight! What is going on out there? You wanna finish this? Bring it on. Dad, stop! Don't! Sam. What happened? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Why didn't you call or text us? Mr. LaRusso, it was my fault. I brought her here. Wait, now, don't even start. I gave you a second chance. This whole thing was a mistake. You know, you wanna end up like him, that's up to you. All right, come on, Sam. Please, Dad. Sam, I don't wanna hear it. Let's go. ♪ Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning I sit around ♪ Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry ♪ Strange voices are saying  what did they say? Still nothing from Tory? No, what about you? She won't text me back. I'm getting kind of worried. I couldn't even find her after the party. You think she got in trouble with the cops? I don't know. But missing the first day of school is not a good sign. Yeah. ♪ Leaving me here on my own  It's a cruel, cruel summer ♪ You had to pull up right in front? If you wanted to drive your own car today, you wouldn't have done what you did. Dad. How many times do I have to tell you I'm sorry? I made a mistake. Everyone makes mistakes. But when you get in trouble, you come to me or your mom. Not that guy. I'm sorry I didn't come to you and Mom. That was my fault, not Robby's. I thought I could help him. But he's got his own family. I need to focus on mine. Just do me a favor, okay? This year, just concentrate on precalculus, okay? Got you some pencils and some paper. I wasn't sure what you needed. Thanks. Couldn't find a Trapper Keeper, are those still cool? I don't know what that is. Ah, I had one with a fighter jet, it was awesome. You okay? You nervous about your first day? No, but... Just feel bad about Sam and the LaRussos. I know you don't wanna hear it, but Mr. LaRusso was good to me. Miyagi-Do Karate helped me out a lot. Look... All I'm saying is, maybe you guys can learn a thing or two from each other. All right, you better go. Thanks for driving me, Dad. You've reached the smartphone of Johnny Lawrence, sensei of Cobra Kai Karate. Please leave a message, and I'll get back to you  when I get a chance. Excuse me? I'm new to this school, can you help me find Ms. Santino's class? Hey. Wow. It's that bad, huh? I feel like an idiot. We should've just gone to my house and been honest with my parents. I'm sorry. No, it's my fault, too. From now on, no more lying. I have to tell you something. Miguel gave me the Medal of Honor. And I put it in the backyard so someone would find it. Why would you do that? I didn't want him to earn any points with you. And we'd just kissed and... I guess I felt insecure. Thank you. For telling me the truth. Well, it feels better to get that off my chest. Robby... Well, I can't be late on my first day. See you later. Good morning, students and faculty, welcome to a brand-new year at West Valley High. I hope you all had a  wonderful summer and are ready to dive  back into the school year. Dude, you kissed Sam? Yeah. Nice. No, not nice. I shouldn't have done that to Tory. Why limit yourself to one chick? I'm planning on having a full rotation by the time we get to midterms. What? Hey, man. Just wanted to say, I wet the bed till I was 13... There's nothing to be ashamed of. Get the hell out of my face! What's that guy's problem? I don't know. You can also purchase tickets  for the fall musical, which will be a production  of the global hit Grease. I do appreciate your passion taking initiative and all, but this is highly unusual timing. And your resume's a little spotty. I mean, do you have any actual security guard experience? Mr... Oh, Stingray. Just one word, Stingray. Hmm. I don't have any actual experience, per se. But I just recently won the Black versus Red Challenge at Coyote Creek. No big deal. Hmm. Except for the karate community, it's a very big deal. My sensei's been very pleased with my progress. And I think, in time, you will see a yellow belt strapped around my midsection. I see. This is a very nice setup you have here, by the way. It's, uh... It's terrific. My question for you is... What is the teachers' lounge situation looking like? And finally as we embark upon another academic year, it's important to remember  to be tolerant and accepting of all of our peers, regardless of... Hey, you're not supposed  to be in here. I don't care, move! Give that back! Ow! You're not allowed to... Samantha LaRusso. I know  what you did and now  you're gonna pay for it. I'm coming for you, bitch! I saw what you did at the party. You kissed Miguel. I... I... Get back in there! Yeah, get her! You okay? Stop! Let her go! Hey! Settle down! I'm sure we can figure this out... Hey, man, we gotta do something. Good idea. I'm gonna get a teacher. Oh, it is on! Yeah! I'm not gonna throw the first punch. Too bad. You're going down, nerd. Come and get it, dickhead. Stop fighting! Stop! Oh, you want some of this? Come on, guys, can't we all just get along? This is out of control! Get me security in the main corridor, right away! It's okay, sir, I got this. Yeah. Can't you just stop it already? What's the matter? You can't keep up? You have to do something, Mr. Palmer. Hey! Break it up! Screw this, they don't pay me enough. Not again. You can't cheat your way out of this one. Like that move? I learned it from your dad. Should've stayed in Cobra Kai. You could have been a badass. Who's badass now? Demetri, I know you're in here. Figured you'd hide in the computer lab. You damn nerd. I'm coming for you. Boo. Shit, shit, shit! Come here, Demetri! Tory, enough! What? Sam! Oh, now you're in trouble. Get off me... Hey, hey! Come on! Come on. No, come on. You guys are done. Let me at him. Come on. Is that the only way you know how to fight? Dirty? This isn't a tournament. There are no rules. No hard feelings. Sorry, Eli. That's for taking advantage of Sam. I would never. Then why did it happen? No mercy. She doesn't love you. She loves me! I wasn't taught the difference between mercy and honor, and I payed the price for it. If I'm extra hard on you, it's only because you have the potential to be better than I ever was. You want that, don't you? I'm sorry. Miguel! Clear the way, clear the way. We need an ambulance at West Valley High. Robby, what did you do? Daniel! I just got a call from the high school. What's wrong? Ah, how do I change that? Stupid smart phone. Carmen? You've seen your fair share of these. So you know the next 24 hours are critical. But he's gonna pull through, right? We're doing  everything we can. Excuse me. I'm so sorry. Sorry? Sorry? Before Miguel met you, he was a sweet boy. He avoided fights. Now look what you did. I never want to see you again. It's all right now, okay? Everything's gonna be all right. I'm gonna make sure this girl gets expelled. I don't care about Tory. I just want Miguel to be okay. I can't believe Robby would do that. It's all my fault. No, no. No, don't say that, Sam. Hey, Sensei, it's Miguel, I knocked on  your door this morning, but I guess you already left. I'm having some  girl trouble and, well, you're better at this  sort of thing than me. I'll come by the dojo  after school. My mom is working tonight, so maybe we  could grab a burger  at that place you like? I'll talk to you later. Class. We have a visitor. What the hell do you think you're doing? What does it look like? I'm teaching my students. Your students? You let them down when they needed you the most. Somebody needed to remind them what it takes to win. After everything I did for you? Miguel's in the hospital because of you. He showed mercy to Robby Keene because of you. If he dies, that's on you. I did warn you about this. I told you not to show weakness. Get out. This is my dojo. Oh, I forgot to tell you, when you were out of town, I had a little talk with the landlord. It turns out he doesn't like you much. But you know the problem with those handshake deals, there are no guarantees. You can't do this. Of course I can. I founded Cobra Kai. It belongs to me. It always has, and it always will. I will never let my students lose. Even if they have to learn the hard way. One day you will thank me for this, Johnny. This was a mistake. You want Cobra Kai... It's yours. Class... Forward strike. Hey, where is she? I got her her favorite sandwich from il Tramezzino. Still waiting for her to get back from her X-rays. Now the doctor thinks she might have cracked a rib. Oh, God. This has to stop, Daniel. I know, you're right. I know, I swear. I... I'm not gonna let Cobra Kai get away with this... Enough with Cobra Kai. Don't you see what this stupid rivalry has done? Our daughter is in the hospital. No more karate. Fine. Okay. All right. Amanda, I know you're right. No more karate. It's over. ♪ Hot summer streets and the pavements are burning ♪ I sit around I wore this when I was training for my first tournament back in '81. I want you to have it. ♪ Trying to smile but the air is so heavy and dry Who's the man? Tell me you're the man. I'm the man. It's Cobra Kai. Never accept defeat. ♪ Cruel summer One of the best things in my life has been teaching you. I'll always be on your side and always have your best interest at heart. ♪ It's a cruel, cruel summer ♪ Now you're gone I tried my best. I thought I was doing the right thing. I'm sorry. ♪ The city is crowded  my friends are away ♪ And I'm on my own Don't worry. Miguel is a good kid. I won't let him go astray. ♪ It's a cruel, cruel summer ♪ Leaving me here on my own ♪ It's a cruel  cruel summer... ♪
