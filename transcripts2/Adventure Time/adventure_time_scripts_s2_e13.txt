 Jake! Jake! Hey, man, shouldn't we conserve our energy? The Ice Creamarathon starts tomorrow. I know what the Ice Creamarathon is. I've been training for weeks, and I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Creamarathon than anyone else! You sure like ice cream. Ice cream is good. What the croak was that? Came from over there.

 Whoa, Jake! Check it out! It's a brave, little gnome knight. What? That's frog dressed up like a gnome knight. Actually, I'm a gnome knight who was magically transformed into a frog, and then I decided to continue being a knight. And now you're, like, attracting a mate? No! I'm on the verge of death. Oh. Well, you should just let go, man. Yeah. You've had a good run. No. I cannot die until I find a being

 whose spirit is brave and pure to take over my quest. Quest? Uh-oh. Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog. Tell me more about this... quest. I have to guard these magic beans! Huh? Two of the beans are good, but one... is horribly evil! I have no idea which is which, so I've spent my life guarding them, preventing them from ever being planted. Beans? Magic beans. We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush. We will take your quest. You will? Sure! Consider it guarded. Also, take this. Oh. Uh, okay. Thanks. No. Thank you. Uh... Whoa! - Dude, what's going on? We took over the quest. What?! The beans?! Now, wait a second. Nope. Too late. I miss him already. Well, we should get a move on if we want to make the Ice Creamarathon. What about the quest? Really? We have to do the bean quest? I gave him my word. Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so... can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream? No, man. We're on the job. And like you always say, "work and fun don't mix..." "Unless you're a clown." I do say that a lot. Gee. Sitting in this hot sun, guarding beans. Boy, it sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream, or caramel ice cream, or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves? - That's a terrible idea. - No, wait. Hear me out. See, if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it once and for all. Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringing twice as much good into the world. And we can make it to the Ice Creamarathon. I hadn't even thought about that! ♪ So they planted the beans ♪ ♪ and waited for evil to gro-o-o-w ♪ ♪ So they could kill it and g-o-o-o ♪ ♪ to the Ice Creamarathon ♪ I'm gonna take a catnap. What?! But we have to be ready for evil. If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time. All right, Finn, Jake's a lazy bum, and this soil is ripe with evil. I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed. Wake up, Jake! This is it! Huh? Aah! Bean pod! Hmm. I can't tell if it's evil yet! Aah! Yea-a-a-a-a-a-a-h! Huh? Baby pigs dressed in silly costumes? Aw, look how cute they look, all sleepy and snorey. Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're... evil. Okay, each one of you take one test and one pencil. You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you. And begin. Aw, they're so cute, They can hardly hold their pencils. That doesn't fare well for their... grade-point average. Nothing evil could be this adorable. Wee-wee! Hmm, You might be right. The only thing on here is a cute drawing of an ice cream cone under "do you have allerjies?" Yeah, nothing evil. Okay. The pigs are good. Yes! You hear that, guys?! You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus! Oh, no! Jake, get ready! The second pod is about to drop! Protect the piglets! Stay back, babies! Show me what you have to offer, pod. Magical wands? Wha?! Cool! Stop, Jake! - Wow! - Is it evil? It's a wand that poops glitter. What's good-er than that? Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee! Hmm. Glitter on its own could be evil, but with rainbows? Over my dead body. Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up. Yeah! Whew! I'm exhausted. They look so sleepy and peaceful. We have to stay alert. The evil pod could appear at any time. When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately. And then go to the Ice Creamarathon, right? Yeah, man. Okay. I'll take the first shift. Rhombus. Aah! Look! The third pod! It's bigger than the other two, dude. Yeah, man. We got to kill it... now. Yea-a-a-a-a-h! Unh! Yeah! Yeah! Huh? It's squirting. Squirting? He-yup! See? Squirting. Right here. Tastes good. Dang, man. Don't just lick stuff. It's evil. - No, it's not. It's... ice cream! Is the evil sucking you in?! Jake! That was awesome. Are you poisoned?! Are you dying? No, man! It was awesome! Look, Jake. It's filling back up. Aw, yeah! This pod makes ice cream out of nothing! It's the goodest thing that's ever happened to me. Well, if this pod's not evil... The piglets are gone! And so are the fairy wands. Let's go! The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town! Piglets! Stop this! Aah! Cram! Now I must find these wicked piglets' weakness and use it to retro-buse them. Well, I've found my weakness. That's it! Ice cream! What about ice cream? Yes. Yes. Ha! The exams confirm my memory of the piglets being allergic to ice cream. Just the thought of that scares me, man. I see one of them! Get ready to release! Release! Oh, gross. Gross, man! Jake! Ugh. Jake. Jake, are you okay? I-I-I can't stop dancing! What?! It must be the glitter! Whoa. I really can't stop groovin'. It feels weird! Go on without me! Yea-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h! Freezed to meet you! Hope you saved room for dessert! Killing you with ice cream! Whoo! Yeah, man! Whoa! Jake, there's one left, and I think he's trying to surrender. Kill it! But he's dressed as a little construction worker. It's freakin' adorable. He's trying to trick you! Kill it! I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it, Jake. Why, thank you, Finn and Jake, for sort of saving our village. You're sort of welcome. Now, if you'll excuse us, we need to start removing all of this ice cream from our homes and businesses. Not so fast. I'll take it from here, folks. He likes ice cream. Nice job, Tubby, but save room for the Ice Creamarathon. I've always got room for ice cream, Finn. You know that, man. Ugh. I'm going to the Ice Creamarathon. He just really likes ice cream. Oh! ♪ Come along with me ♪ ♪ and the butterflies and bees ♪ ♪ We can wander through the forest ♪ ♪ and do so as we please ♪ ♪ Come along with me ♪ ♪ to a cliff under a tree ♪ This party is so crazy!
