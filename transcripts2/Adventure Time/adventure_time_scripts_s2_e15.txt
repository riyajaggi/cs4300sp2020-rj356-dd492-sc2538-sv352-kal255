 Careful. You'll wreck my gift for Princess Bubblegum. Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway? It's a scale model of The Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva. So, this means you want to give her your spit, huh? Yep. Hey, no! It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Ha ha ha! I just wanted to give her something,

 uh, to celebrate her science... thing. You mean her... super science barbecue?! You think it's sciencey enough for her? Relax. She'll love it. And then she'll love you. - Wha?! - Hey, there's Bubblegum. Hide it behind your back, man. Princess! Oh. Hi, guys. Just getting the grill cooking for tonight's BBQ. Oh. What's that you got behind your back there, Finny? Oh, I-I made you something. Really?! Can I scope it?

 Yes. Close your eyes. A'ight. Get ready to open your eyes? Ah-choo! Can I open my eyes? No, wait! Uh, keep them closed for like three more hours. I'm gonna open my eyes. Oh, Finn! It's pink! I love pink! Oh, thanks, Finn. Princess, Princess! Better not say nothing, you. Yes, Chet? Um, so, I called Grill-meister for the BBQ, but Pepper won't give up the spatula. Fine, fine. You can have it... when you pry it from my cold, dead hands! N-o-o-o-o! Hey, if you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the... grill?! Meat! Die, you fire! Finn, that was awesome. Oh. Thanks, Princess. I'm always happy to help. I see. Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way. Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbecue. You should talk about something, too. You'll do that for me, right? Anything you want. Thanks, Finn. Listen, I have to deal with this. See you tonight? Uh, yeah. Buddy, just breathe into me. Huh? You're just gonna give a speech to a bunch of brainiacs. I can't hang with those guys. I'm full of stupid. Then we'll just borrow some brains by going to the place where knowledge lives! Oh, Braintown. Uh, no, the library. The library of the undead. No, just the regular library. Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring. But I have to cram this info. Okay, okay. I'll just keep reading this book about figs. And I'll just read this book about pigs. Ha ha! Whatcha doing? I'm bored now, too. Shh, hey! That's completely inappropriate. But... but we were just enthusiastic about learning. Hmm. So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me. Yeah, then you can at least sound smart. But where you gonna find someone like that? Jake, we're going to college. And the great question endures. Who would win in a fight between Nietzsche's Ubermensch and Mandroid? The answer is Werewolf Queen. It's always Werewolf Queen. Rad! Jake, you can just shrink yourself down. Oh, yeah. And when I finally meet the Werewolf Queen, she will take me on as her royal consort, and we will rule in blood! Hey, teach, can you talk more about scientific, uh, stuff and things? Well, sure, I could... if this wasn't a class on Theoretical Fight-onomics. Oh. Are you even in this class, Mister... Uh... Wormy... Wormy McSquirmy. McSquirmy, huh? Well, we'll just see about that. Oh, there you are. W. Mcsquirmy. I'm sorry. Yes, you're registered, and you haven't shown up for a single class. Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy. Hey! Ow! Please, where's your compassion? - Let's kill him. - Assail! Excelsior! Ohh! Aah! Jake, let's get out of here. Ow! And stay out of academia! Ugh! Well, that's it. I'm all out of ideas on how to learn this junk. Oh! Let's just solve this thing with magic. No. That's the easy way out. Yeah. It's the easy way out. Oh. Oh, yeah! Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack. Magic, you say? Yeah, Choose Goose. I need magic... some kind of mind-enhancing magic. Oh, yes, the quest that you are on requires... the glasses of Nerdicon! So, I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture. And Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it. Yeah! What do you want for it, C.G.? Lately, I've been feeling drained. I only wish to be entertained. Hmm. Oh! Oh! Well done. The glasses you have won! Everything small is just a small version of something big! I understand everything! Whoa, bud, are you okay? Oh, Jake, I'm better than okay. I know exactly how to impress The Princess. - More spit bubbles? - No, no. Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality. But wait. Maybe you're onto something. I could show the Princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen! And how will you do that? I'll start with a solid bulleted list. Thanks again to Dr. Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness. Yes, yes, how charming. What quaint notions. And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes... Finn, the human! Ladies and gentlemen... and Princess, I'm here to talk about multidimensional bubbles. But I am not just going to talk about blowing bubbles. I'm going to blow your minds. Hmm? This is a bubble blower of my own design. With this, you can blow bubbles in different dimensions. This two-dimensional bubble casts a one-dimensional shadow. A three-dimensional bubble casts a two-dimensional shadow. A fourth-dimensional bubble casts a three-dimensional shadow. It is beyond comprehension! Beyond space! Beyond time! Finn, that would mean you've created... Yes, a black hole! Whoa! Whoa! Finn, do something! It's okay. I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted... list! Don't worry. I have everything under control. Under control?! My guests are terrified. Yes! And their brains are releasing adrenaline, dopamine, even dimethyltryptamine from the pineal gland! This has serious educational value. Thanatophobia and this N.D.E. is giving us euphoric altered awareness. Don't you see, Princess? We were all born to die! You're trying to kill us all? No, of course not. I'm trying to give you the greatest conference ever! Finn, you've gone insane. What?! No way. I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses. Glasses? Finn, take those off. You're not yourself. - But... - Please! I need the real you. What's going on? Whoa?! You blew it, Finn, with this. Then I'll kill it with this. Be careful. Finn! Look out! Wha? Fourth dimensional! Jake, let me go! Finn, don't do anything stupid! I can't help it, man. I'm all about stupid. Yeah! Finn! Finn, my science barbecue was a fiasco. That was incredible. That was the greatest conference ever! What's this? "Make hyper bubble, cause black hole, become insane, P.B. takes off the glasses, save the day, win the heart of the Princess"? Finn, you knew all this would happen? Huh? Knew what? I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness.
