 Jake, what am I supposed to be meditatin' about? Don't know. I'm thinkin' of pillows stuffed with spaghetti. Clear your minds. I have to go check on something! Can we go with? Perhaps you are ready to go with. Guys, you'll need to put these on. Pull back your hat. Neat! Stay close to me.

 Whoa! At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of Amber... the Lich! What's that sound? He's casting spells... trying to get in your head and control your bod. But these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless. He would have full control over us. That's freakin' nuts.

 Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life-force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo. But before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree. I... What the nuts?! Dude, be a big sword! Oh! Okay. I'll try. Quickly, to the other secret room! There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich... The gauntlet of the hero. Billy! Billy's big ol' beef fingers! Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet. His only desire is to destroy life. If you fail, he'll kill everyone! No! That will not happen! Oh, there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. I just don't want you to get sick. Take this sweater. I made it myself. I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn. I love it! Me, too. Hey, hey, hey! So, I've been thinking about this a lot lately. And, well, uh... Ooh! Gosh, I'm so nervous. Finn and Jake, will you give me your blessing so I can marry Princess Bubblegum? What is wrong with you?! What's wrong with me?! No! Not the latch! Quickly now, Finn. Track the Lich by his trail of death. Here I go! Here I go! Be safe! This is our first "fate of the world" deal. Yeah, man. We got to shut this fool down, hardcore. Running this fast makes my stomach hurt. Run through it, man! We got to get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich! Oh, my! How clumsy of me! What the heck, Ice King?! Ooh! Hey! Wait you guys. I'm serious about Bubblegum. Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs! Yuck! Guys? It's not fair! She always hangs out with you. And it's not like you want to marry her. Why are you following us?! Whoa! I told you already! I want your blessing so I can marry Princess Bubblegum! Come on, you guys. Give me permission to marry her. I'll... I'll... I'll do a little dance for you. Hmm? You like this? No! Oh. Come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me. Ice King, go away, man! I will! When you bless our wedding! No, thanks, guy! Hmm? How does this gauntlet work?! Whoa! I can't turn it off! Punch it in the eye! Whew! Let's blow this stand! I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to this, driven me to bad doing. Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay. Please be okay. Please be okay. Stupid thing. Come on! Ice King! Get out of here! I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you. That's insane! I know! But I'll show them. I'll show them how they've hurt us! No-o-o-o! There! Out over the lake! After his butt! I'm your dinghy dog! Here! I'll help paddle! Hey. It's me. Aw, come on! I'm sorry I punched you in the ball. Waah! Yeah! Closing in... gonna get you, man! Closer, Jake! Closer... Clo-o-o-o-ser... Ah! Princess? No! Oh, no. Oh, gross. This water stinks. Aw! Ice King! Look! Look what you made me do to her! Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power! Oh, no! He's made it! Don't worry, Princess! Hey, where you guys goin'? What's going on? I don't have time for this! Then let's go! My pack! It's okay! Whoa! Waah! Man. I-I want to go after them, but that hole looks scary, doesn't it? Well, holes are holes! The Lich! He's gettin' his powers back. Weird. No! Prepare thyself... to get smote in the name of Bubblegum... Shh. Yep. Holes are holes. Yaah! Look out! That's it! I'm gonna bark him! Whoa! Aah! Finn. Oh, no! Finn... Come. Stop! Aren't you cold, Finn? Walk into the well, Finn. Aren't you cold? No, I'm not! I've got a sweater on! You are a joke to me! This sweater. It's keeping me safe. I care about you, Finn. This is it... the ultimate weapon against evil. The power of I-I... luh... I-liking someone a lot. Lich! Ugh! Finn! Buddy! Guh... Jake? Jake! Oh, Finn! You did it! We did? Hey! Yeah! We did it! Oh, you guys! This experience has brought us all so much closer together. Princess, I'm sorry for all of this. I love you, and I've decided to set you free! Go free-e-e-e! Uh... Whoops! I've got the dropsies!
