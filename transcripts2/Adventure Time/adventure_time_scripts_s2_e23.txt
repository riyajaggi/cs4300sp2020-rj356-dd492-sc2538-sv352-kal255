 Don't forget LSP's diet cola. I won't. I really do love "Finn and Jake Movie Club." Okay, everybody. Apple juice for Tree Trunks... diet soda for LSP... Eh... What did you order, PB? Oh, I brought my own. Huh. Iced latté for M'lady.

 Tomato juice for Marceline. Thanks, Finn. Hot cocoa for Beemo. This does compute. And, finally, a thimble of milk for Shelby, the worm who lives in Jake's viola. You can just call me "Shelby." Jake? We're so excited that you could be here tonight for "Finn and Jake's Movie Club's" feature presentation... "Heat Signature 3." Oh, with the submarine? Sounds great.

 Get on with it! Princess Bubblegum's in my seat. We decided last time no reserved seating... First come, first served. What's that? Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies. Yeah, it's on all the movies we dig up. I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn. All right. Let's take a look. Pause, Beemo. "Warning... federal law provides severe and criminal penalties for the unauthorized exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures." All right, well, goodbye! Sorry we had to cancel. We've been showing these films unauthorized! But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War. We should still respect authority, Mang. Yeah? Are we meeting next week to watch a movie? Uh... Uh, yeah, maybe. I-I think so. Finn, don't cancel movie club! I've literally been having the time of my life. Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have "Finn and Jake Movie Club" next week for sure. Jake and I just have to find a movie without that warning. Good! Okay. All right, well, we'll see you next time! Bye-bye! Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning. We're not gonna find a movie, Jake. Well, what are we gonna do? We're gonna make one! Wow-p! Movie filming time! Okay, Beemo. Turn to your right and start filming. Start to truck in. Keep going. Keep trucking in, Beemo. Huh? That was awesome, Beemo! Yeah. Fantastic. Super. Don't lose her, Beemo. Front shot! Front shot! Film the clouds! Don't forget the little one! Beemo! Beemo, you're gonna miss it! Over there, to your right! Oh, we're gonna miss it! Hurry, Beemo! Don't lose it! Oh, looks like it's gonna fall! Follow it! Look over there... Across the river! Beemo, forget about the coin! Film that over there! Zoom in. Weird. Let's get some more footage. Whee! Whee! Nom! Nom! Nom! Nom! Like that? Yeah! Perfect! Are y-you sure? Yeah! Looks great! Wait, what about this? That's even better! Uh... What do you think? I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk. Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining. Yeah, like a romantic comedy. Exactly... an action adventure. Wait, that's not what I said. Let's get to filming! Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine... swing over the crocodiles... do a triple flip with a full twist, and land clean! Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive! Action! No! No smooching! Cut! I thought it was great. No, we can't use any of it. I think we should use all of it. No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smooching. That was dumb. What?! Du-u-u-u-u-u-u-mbah! Okay, you're having a picnic. You're in love, but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action! Why did you do that?! Cut, cut, cut! Cut! That was not what I wanted! That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that. What's next? Okay, PB. Move back a little. Stop! - Finn? - Yeah? How does this work? Um... Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him, and when he does, you're gonna run alongside the chariot, and it's gonna look like you're driving it. Okay. Hey, Finn. Yeah? How about when the chariot takes off, she says something like, "Mm, check, please!" What?! No, that's terrible. And... action! Check, please? Aw, Jake! You... you brought the fly in too close! I'm sorry. Well, help me catch him. Well, I thought it was funny. This isn't a comedy! Not the way you're shooting it. Look, just help me catch this guy. All right, but after this, we do my part. Okay, everyone, it's been a long day. Lot of... a lot of running around, chasing frogs. But we are making a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson. Yes. And, Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends. And then you both realize you do love each other, and you both say, "I do." And then, Shelby, you say... "Check, please!" Yeah. Don't forget to look right in the camera and slap your cheeks like this... And... One, two, three, action! Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife? Oh. Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! I didn't tell you to flex out! No! I don't like the way he's flexing at you! I don't hear her complaining. Why, you... Check, please! How much longer till you finish editing, Beemo? About 20 hours. 20 hours?! Yeah. You guys shot a lot of footage... About 20 hours. Jake, let's talk about our movie. Okay. I think we shot a lot of great stuff... Uh-huh. But I'm thinking only half of it is usable. Me too. Really?! Yeah, I was just thinking that. That's great! I know! You actually agree it's an action-adventure! Yep, it... wait! No! What?! Romantic comedy! What?! What do you mean, "What?!" Who's right, Beemo? Yeah! Me or Finn?! We'll ask him when he wakes up. Why wait? "Dear Beemo... please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake." "And Finn." See you at the movie club, then! Oh, I'll be there! As will I. As will I as well. Yes. Oh, yes. Ugh! I can't wait! Oh! I can't wait! All right. Thanks again, everyone, for coming to... ♪ Movie Night! ♪ I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh! I hope y'all are ready to be on the edge of your seats for tonight's action-adventure film! It's, uh, more of a romantic comedy, right, Beemo? Eeeee. Well, I guess we'll see! Yeah, I guess we will! Start the movie, Beemo! It's a little awkward. Ooh! Ahh! Oh, my gosh! ♪ Finn, why are you fighting with your friend? ♪ ♪ Jake, you know this can't be the end ♪ ♪ Romance or action does not matter ♪ ♪ Hurting your friend will make you sadder ♪ ♪ Guys, you know you're much more than this ♪ ♪ You two, please stop, or you'll undo ♪ ♪ All that you've been through ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Just hug, and it's agreed ♪ ♪ Your love will not delete ♪ - Yes! - Yeah! Beemo's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man. Me too, dude. Oh, my gosh, you guys. I can't wait till next week's movie club! Check, please. That's a good one, Beemo!
