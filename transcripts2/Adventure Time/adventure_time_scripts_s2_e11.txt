 Hm. Relax, restless-pants. A true Ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies. Jin! Ninjas. Ninjas ain't real for nothin', nohow. Whoa, now. Ninjas are real. For, you see... ♪ Do-do-do! ♪ Jake and I are Ninjas. Yep. Ever since we fished this Ninja manual out of a ditch.

 Finn, booty me! Wenk. Listen! Wenk, wenk, wenk. Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages. Ho-ho! Oh, Gunter, let's go. I've got the overnight bag. Wenk, wenk! It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself. Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a Princess when we weren't looking somehow. That's Ninja logic. Then we got to... - Ahem. We got to save that Princess. You got it, Shino-bro. Ninja kick. Ninja kick. Princess? Princess? Princess? Princess?! Princess?! Uh... No Princess here, man. No Princess? It's... A trap. We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade, evade! Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured Princesses because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doing it right now. Are you sure? No. It's only a Ninja hunch, so we should Ninja snoop for proof. Wait, man. I-I'd feel uncomfortable snooping through the Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sort of like... A violation. Gah! Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary. No, no, no, no, no. We can't read his private junk. And yet we must. "Dear diary, and you better write me back this time. Today, I'm bringing home a special new cutie." There's our proof, man! Hmm. All right. Let's use our Ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the Princess. Or we could keep looking through his stuff... You know, for more proof. He-he-he! No. Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. Then... boom! We catch him with Princess on his hands. Where are we gonna hide? In this filthy hamper! Think he's there yet? See anything? Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore. It reeks in here. But we're Ninjas, and this is our Ninja hideout. Nah, man. My sense of smell is like 1,000 times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out. Wait! I'm out! Jake! Get back here! Hey, wait up! Check this out. Weird. I want to draw something. Hey, we got to leave no trace. Ninjas leave no trace. I'll delete it after. Hey, come on! Jake, what have we done? Aah! A secret hidden room full of Ninja stuff! Oh, great. A line. Excuse me. Pardon me. Uh... I-I think you were actually... Ahead of me. You know I was. Counter maid, I demand medicinal attentions... Preferably those of a Princessy type. And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver? Hey! I'm as healthy as 10 old men! Wenk, wenk. Huh? Oh, oh, right. My penguin. He's very, very sick. So, what time does your shift end? What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another cave? What's this? A spell book? Whoo! Dude! Leave no trace. Ah, it's too late for that. It's not too... Late. Whoa! What you got there? Dude! It's a First-Edition Ice Ninja manual. "True Ninja passes no wind. He only passes..." I ain't even heard of these techniques. Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh... numb-chucks. Hey, Ice King seems way into Ninjas, even more than we are. Yeah. So? Oof! So, doesn't that mean that Ninjas must be kind of lame? Nah, they're still cool, but Ice King's still lame because he hides his Ninja love. We wear our Ninja on our sleeve! Jake! Show me how to do that. What's taking that doctor so long?! Gunter, make more noise. Yeah, all right, all right. Don't oversell it, Drama Queen. Dun-dun-dun! Pardon the intrusion. I'm Dr. Princess. Yes. Well, uh... come to Ice King, Princess. Don't worry, Sir. I specialize in treating little tuxedo people. Just give it to me straight, Doc... Am I gonna have to pay for this? Hmm. Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk. Oh, my. What can you do for him, Dr. Princess? Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower. Oh. I'm sorry. How did your wife die? Oh, uh, what? Is that what that means? Whoa, Nellie! Something... Medical is happening. Wenk! Gunter, you're embarrassing me! Frigidtsu Master Finn summons... Dagger of chilled glass. Frigidtsu Master Jake summons... Stars of frozen rain. Get ready to be... Star-struck. Get ready to be... Cold-cut. Hyah! Kunai attack! Icicle kick! Force of blizzard! Flying jump! What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm! Those Jakes were all fakes! Ha! Frigidtsu Master Jake summons... Arrow of ice! Hyah! Rad! Oh-oh-oh-oh! It's the Ice King. Hide! ♪ Do-do-do-do ♪ ♪ Ay-yoo-hoo-hoo ♪ Okay, my dear, this enclosure will be your new home. He's got a Princess. Now we leap out, catch him red-handed. Hai! Snow-blind! Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice. But once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable. Hyah! Ice King, hand over that Princess! Hyah! Princess? What? Jake, where's the Princess? Ooh, right. What Princess? The, um, Princess you were just talking to. Yeah, the one you just came back from stealing. Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers! Wenk. I was just talking to the egg. It's such a cutie. Gunter's a woman?! What? No. Huh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair. Aah! What happened to my recliner?! Oh. My skins and tubs! You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you? No Princess? No. No Princess. We messed up, Jake. We're... Violators. Yeah, what the heck? You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles? Who do you guys think you are? We're... Ninjas? You're not Ninjas. You're just a couple of jerks! It's true. Ice King, we're gonna make this right. Yeah, do it. Make it right. Start by, uh... oh, take my bag over to the cage. Oh, no, no, no! Not that. Never mind. Uh, put that down and go clean my gym equipment. Dr. Princess! Oh. I have no idea how that got in there. What's going on? I'll field that one. The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth. Yes. Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a Princess M.D. I'm not even a real Princess. Princess is just a surname. Enough! You may have uncovered my Princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive! Ha ha! A couple of Ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another Ninja! ♪ Do-do-do! ♪ Ninja! Ninja! What am I... looking at here, exactly? Ninja! So, how's your egg doing? Wenk, wenk. Oh. Wenk, wenk. Gunter! Why didn't you tell me? We-we-wenk. Oh, gunter. ♪ Come along with me ♪ ♪ And the butterflies and bees ♪ ♪ We can wander through the forest ♪ ♪ And do so as we please ♪ ♪ Come along with me ♪ ♪ To a cliff under a tree ♪
