Marceline, can we float now? Mm, not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you got to go through vampire orientation. Think you chumps can handle it? ♪ Oh, baby! ♪ ♪ Yeah, baby! ♪ ♪ Baby, baby, baby, yeah! ♪ ♪ Baby, yeah, yeah! ♪ Okay, guys. The first phase of vampire orientation is learning... Invisibility!

It worked. - We're invisible! - Ugh! - You're invisible! - Hey, then how come we can see each other? Because you guys became vampires at the same time, so you're forever linked. Aw, yeah! Marceline... You're friends with some real morons. Oh, my God, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good! I mean, she still looks fat, but, like, I can't say that junk to her face. Wow! Lsp's a hobo! Let's mess with her. I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this - can of beans. Who-o-o-o-o-o-! Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff! She knows it's us! She must recognize our voices! Let's disguise them! We're in-vee-see-beel! Melissa! I have to go! They got into my toilet paper! Melissa, I have to go! - Give it back, you guys! - Whee! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake! N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! My beans! Aah! Time to join in on the fun! You guys... Ruined everything! - I'm gonna kill you! - But we're undead. Geez, we really scared her. Nice vampire scare, guys. Thanks. Yeah... Pretty good, fellas. Yeah. You guys ready... For the next vampire lesson? You know we are! Good! Ow! Ugh! W-what's the point of this lesson?! - Kick 'em harder! - Ugh! Ouch! Ow! Oh, my body! It hurts! Oof! Okay, everyone. Stop the toughness lesson! W-what? - Finn, Jake, you guys okay? We're okay. It's all worth it. See? They're fine. When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. Hey, guys. I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. Cool. W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating! Like, uh, the spooky vampire walk! See? Spo-o-o-o-o-o-oky! Whoo! No, way! We want to fly! You guys, stop right now! Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan. Now, get in your flying positions. Vampires forever! Whoo! What are you guys waiting for? Y-you said you had a plan. We do. It's to let them die. Wee-wha-whoo! - Oh, yeah! Oof! Whoo! Awesome! We did it! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Awesome! Way to go, marceline. Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends! They got to die someday. Hey! Let's invite them to our place. When they show up... We'll suck their guts out through their brains! Did you see us?! Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing. Hey, we're gonna throw a party... In honor of your new vampire skills. Holy snaps! That's awesome! They're lying to you guys. They just want to suck the guts - out of the top of your head. - What?! She's just jealous of you. We'll see you at midnight at our place. Guys, promise me you're not - going to that party. - We're not gonna go. - You're not? - Nah. I'm kind of tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill. Oh. Okay. Well, we're going back home. - Peace. - Number 25 blood drive. Hey, guys! We're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome! Um... Hyah! Georgy, what's wrong?! - Jake, what's happening?! - I think they're testing - our vampire ability! - Oh, sweet. Vampire kick! Ugh! Aw, come on! Will you knock it off already? You know you're not even real - vampires. - Psh! Then why am I flying, Wendy? Oh. Whoa! Yo, man. - I think marceline tricked us. - Yeah. Vampire kick! Finn, Jake... I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should have never pranked you - so perfectly. - It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us. Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's like a rock-paper-scissors thing. - I just came to apologize. - Aw, man! I can't believe we're gonna die just 'cause we wanted to be comfortable watching "heat signature." Uh, did you guys say... "Heat signature"? Have you located the enemy's heat signature, private? Yes, sir. But I also noticed something... Strange, something I-I... I can't explain. Well, spit it out, man! I-I... I can't seem to locate our heat signature! - Oh! This stinkups mega bam-bam to the j-stop! Can we just go back to the brain eating, or whatever? Mm-hmm, after the movie. - But can't we just... Shh! Shut! Look out, commander! Aah! My heat signature!
