 - Ha ha! - Time to protect the sun. Ha ha, yeah. He knows how to get things started. Fire pit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy. You wonder why they even put it there. It's probably a computel gleech. Now comes some real trouble. It's Bouncy Bee. He's gonna get that sun, man. Ha ha, please.

 Bleep. - Ha ha! I had my eyes closed on that one. Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude. Go back. I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun, like this sloppy butt right here. Hunny bunny. I'm like, "Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bombuh." Man, you are hot tonight. Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam? Oh, I very can.

 Remember, use a combo move. Okay, here it goes. Up, down, left, left, right, right, down. Spin, down, up, left. Faster, dude. Right, left, down. Ohh! Every time! Beemo, this game is the worst. If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam, breezily... with my mitts. Oh, no. It's much more dangerous than you think. Whoa, whoa, wait! Beemo, is there a way for us to get in the game for real? Yes, of course, Jake. If I push this button... If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main-brain-game-frame, where it is very dangerous. Oh, man! Oh, Beemo! You got to let us in that game. No. It's a far-too-dangerous incredible adventure for you. That's final. Oh. Okay, Beemo. Well, time for bed. Finn? Time for bed, right, Jake? Oh, right. Good night, Beemo. Time for bed. Wow! Whoa! Whoa! We're in the game! Look, there's the sunshine we got to protect. And there's the hole we're supposed to go down. And there's you... doing whatever you're doing. I'm looking at my bits. My leg is math! Mm, that sunshine feels good. Feels good all over. No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it. Let's go kick their digital bootays! Doot-doot. Doot-doot-doot. Beep-boop. ♪ We are in the computer world ♪ ♪ We're computer boys, not computer girls ♪ ♪ In a game, I can be who I virtually am ♪ ♪ I can walk and sing ♪ ♪ I can kill Sleepy Sam ♪ Hey, what stinks? Smells like... Pit! Looks a mite bigger inside the game. Jumping over this pit is easy, remember? We can do this backwards with our eyes closed. Aah! I'm burning! Jake! What, man? Wha?! Jake, what the shank? Check it out... extra lives. You still have two left. Aah-ha! Ow! It burns! Ow! Aah-ha! Jake! ♪ Do, do-do-do ♪ Dude, what if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse? That makes me just want to sit here and feel bad. No way, man. We're gonna cross that hole with real-world grit. Come on! Faster, Jake. Get ready to stretch it. Watch out, Jake! Wow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude. We're pretty intense dudes. Yeah! What's that sound? It sounds like... Bouncy Bee! Whoa! Hyah! Ho! You ready to flippin' this guy up, Jake? Easy peasy, livin' greasy. No! Finn's dead. Finn, no. Why? No!! Curse this false virtual world. Oh, Finn. Yo, what up? Oh, Finn! You're alive. Yeah, I got extra lives, man. Oh, my gosh. Let's never die again. There's nothing more precious than a life. Ooh, dude, look... coins. Oh, man! Oh, man! Hee, hee, hee. Ooh! Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick. Let's take them back to the real world. We'll be filthy, stinking rich. Whoa! Hunny Bunny! N-o-o-o! Time to use the bombuh. Come to me, bombuh. Bombuh! Oh, bombuh, I can't select you without my controller. Let's get out of here, Finn. Man, we never run away from Hunny Bunny. Aah! Fire pit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny... They're supposed to be the easy parts. They're all hard as butts. Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker. Look, Finn, the most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin. Man, get ahold of your brains. We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam. Hey, that's him right there. Get down. What's he doing? He's probably trying to psyche me out. I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you, uh... Stinky Sam... stupid frog. Aah! Ugh! My... my mitts didn't... Didn't work. Come on, help me punch him. Okay! Roar! Let's get out of here, man! We're gonna die! I can see the lights. We're almost there! Ugh! Oh, no, man. It's the edge of the screen. We're trapped, and they'll be here any second. Wait, dude. The bombuh. We can't get the bombuh. Wait, dude. Hmm. - Jake? Jake? What if I... That's not how it works. Error, error, error. Jake, let go of that. But we need the bombuh. Whoops. Finn! Huh? Oh, holy cow! That was nuts, man! Yeah, man. And I got my coin. What?! A penny?! Beemo! Oh, no! Are you all right, buddy? You... you have to... y-you... Oh, no! Too late! Run! Aah! No. No. No. Don't kill us. We don't have extra lives. No! Whoa, wait. Hold up, guys. Check it out. Sunshine. Oh, boy. That feels good. All right. See you later, Sam. You mean that's it? You're not gonna kill us? No, of course not. The game's over. We won. All we wanted was the sunshine... and to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years. What? Help! Oh, no! Beemo! Oh, sure, he's dangerous. If he hits his button again, back we go. Beemo, quick! Hit your button! I-I can't, Finn. I'm stuck. You want him to hit his button?! What's wrong with you?! We'll save you, Beemo. Finn, go! They're too strong. Use the combo move, Finn. The combo move! Combo move? That never works. Listen, you got this, man. I know you... I know you can do it, buddy. You got this! Okay, okay. You got this, Finn. For your friends. Up, down, left, left, right, right, down, spin, down, up, left, right, left, down, spin, up, down, jump! Aah! Aah! Whoa. - Whoo-hoo! You did it, Finn! I knew you had the stuff. Right, Beemo? Ohh! - Oh, crud. - Beemo! I'm sorry, buddy. Finn, I told you about the danger, and now look... You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up. I know, I know. I was double-butt, for real. But, man, now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun. Yeah, yeah! How about it, Beemo? You in? Up, down... Hey, don't do the combo move on us. W-We were only joking. Beemo! Stop messing around. Left, down...
