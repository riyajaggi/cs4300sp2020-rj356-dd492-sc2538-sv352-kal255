 Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish! That's not a shooting star. It's just a firefly. What are you gonna wish for, dude? Oh, you know... that something special only two bros can share. I think I'm wishing for the same thing! You mean the... Ancient psychic tandem war elephant! Oh, man! I want to ride it so bad! How do you even control those things? You can't control it, dude.

 You have to let it give you control. Oh, wow! Start wishing! What the?! That's a distress flare from my other hot dog knights! I sent them to rescue my other other hot dog knights who got trapped in a labyrinth! Their message says... "Baby... Us... Trouble... Time." They must be in great danger! Hot dog knights are slow.

 Don't worry, Princess. Jake and I are on it. Whoa. Fudge, man. This place is yoga balls huge! Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude. Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth. Should we, like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls? Naw, man. Look. Okay, well, then... I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this. See? You're a cool guy, Jake. Thank you. Man! There's so many passageways and stuff. It'll take us forever to find those hot dog kni-i-i-i-ghts. Don't eat me, man! Naw, we're here to save you, guy. Oh, thank the stars. We were lost. How didn't you guys get lost? We're just gonna follow Jake's body back. Ooh! Whoa! Far out! Aw, look at that! - That's great. At the center of the maze, there's a magic creature that grants wishes. "Wishes"?! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Ancient psychic tandem war elephant! This is our chance! Hot dog! Hold on, boys! We're gonna get us some wishes! Choo-choo! Choo-choo! ♪ Sing, 'cause your mama, your mama, your mama said ♪ ♪ She said your mama, your mama, your mama what? ♪ ♪ Whatcha mama say? ♪ ♪ She say ♪ ♪ I'm busy making babies, greasy babies ♪ ♪ sliding on my gravies in the... ♪ Uh, I forgot the next part. Dang, Jake! Your body's getting thin! Hey I got a nice bod. Yeah... but right now? Uh... not so nice. Okay, well, you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private. Whereas I can take my healthy body issues and... fight a golem! Trespassers! Huh! Wrap him up, Jake! I'm on it! Stop flexing! I can't... stretch... anymore! You can do it, Jake! Stretch, stretch, stretch! Wrap him up more! Come on, baby! Yeah! Golem... taken care of... Dudes. Jake, you're amazing! Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man. What?! N-no Jake. You can keep going, man! Right, guys! Come on, Jake! You can go! Jake! Jake! Jake! All right. Come on, Finn. The stretchy train is leaving the station. Choo-choo. Hmm. Just got to keep stretching! Uh... yeah. Wait! Stop, Jake. You hear that? - No. - This place is weirding me out. Keep your eyes open for traps and junk. Whoa. Check that out. Oh, snap! That's you, dude! Hmm. - Boop. Hey, man, watch it. I think that's my nerp, but, like, super stretched out. Boop, boop! Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boop! Stop, man! Phoo! Nerp! Oh, my grob! It's okay! Hot dogs are immune to poison! - Sick! - I got it! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow! Jake! Jake! Jake! I'm good, man. It's the small scorpions you got to worry about. Or is that just with snakes? Ooh, nope. Wait. Poison's kicking in. No, Jake! No! Hang in there, Jake. Work through the pain! Let's get wishes! Wishes! All right, you guys. Hop on. Let's do it. I don't think this is a good idea, man. I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time. Uh... uh... okay. Whoa! Hmm. Looks like the final puzzle. You think you can stretch up there, buddy? - Yes. - Whoa! Jake, you okay?! Uh, yeah. I just can't close my eyes. Lids... too tight. Okay, dude, this is too far! No more maze. We're going home. Yeah. I'm feeling a little thin. Don't stop! Take it to max! Max it! - You stretch good! Jake! Jake! Jake! Whoo! Uh... all right. Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt! - Go harder! - Go stronger! I'm going for it! Jake, no. Jake! Jake! Jake! Done. That must be the wishes! Ki-i-i-i-tty... You did it, man. Now we can go wish for our... Ancient psychic tandem war elephant. Got to move carefully. My internal organs are super stretched... paper thin. I love kitties. - Wha? - I am sorry! Aah! Jake! My insides are all mashed up. I knew we should have turned back! You were right. I pushed myself too far. I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again. No.. Jake! Jake! Jake! Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times. Just hang tight, buddy. I'll use my wish to save you. Congratulations, warriors. Step forward and take your wishes! Ah! I'm gonna wish for a hat! Whoo! Who's next? Mnh-mnh. That floor got traps. Jake should stretch us across! - Jake! Jake! Jake! Here we go! No! Jake is all jacked up! But how else can we get wishes? Jake, get up and carry us across! But I'm too weak! Jake! Jake! Jake! Yeah! Jake! Jake! Yeah! That's it. I'm dead. Jake! Stay with me, man! - Nah. - But we did it, okay? I can wish you out of here, man! Oh, yes. Now you may each receive your wish for real. But be warned. There are no do-overs. Okay, so you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right? I wish for a box! Sweet! I wish to blow up! I mean like "get big." Wow. You guys are really stupid. What do you mean? Dog, you're next. What do you wish? Huh? Jake, wish for the ancient psychic tandem war elephant! Then I'll wish to save you! Right. It's so hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry. You wasted your wish, man! I know. You should wish for the ancient psychic tandem war elephant. It's what we wanted. That's crazy, man. I gotta save your life! Do it... for... me. I... wish for... the ancient psychic tandem war elephant. Yes! Your wish is granted. Wha?! It has to give you control! Remember! I'm on it! Ancient psychic tandem war elephant, hear me! Finn the human, are you worthy to command me? You know I am, because you're psychic! Now wish for my friends to be healed! I wish for what Finn desires! Yeah, boy! No! You weren't supposed to have your wishes come true! You were supposed to die! Now bust us out of here. No! Yeah, boy!
