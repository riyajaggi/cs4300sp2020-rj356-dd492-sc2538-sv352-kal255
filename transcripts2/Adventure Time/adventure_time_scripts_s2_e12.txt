 You want some more eggs, beemo? - Yes, please. - How about you, finny? - Need a refill? - I'm pretty full, man, but let me see if I can... Rearrange. - Nope. Can't do it. - I don't know if - stomachs work like that, dude. - Sometimes it helps. Can't argue with that. Eee, eee! Ahh. Ahh. Ahh. Ohh. Hello. Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. All right, I love you, too.

 - Bye. - Lady rainicorn again? Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna "freak out." Um... Maybe give her parents some treasure? No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, "smoove" them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous. It's perfect. I'll just send them a quick prism-gram. Mm-hmm. - What's it say? - Hold on. Still converting the light waves into brain waves.

 Aaaah. They're into it, dude! Sweet! Let's go powder our noses! - Why's lady so nervous, anyway? - Well, she didn't really say, but it might have something to do with the rainicorn/dog - wars. - There were wars between - rainicorns and dogs? - Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the crystal dimension. - But lady and I are cool. - Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog hatred from the war times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid lady from ever hanging out with you again! Nah. That could never happen. You didn't think this through enough. - It could happen! - Waaah! - I'm a moron! - Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. - Homeys help homeys. Always. - I'm ready to hear your - plan, homey. - Ketchup! - Mustard! Red and yellow! ♪ Lady's parents ♪ ♪ I say hello ♪ ♪ I'm the fellow for your daughter ♪ ♪ please forget the wartime slaughter ♪ ♪ home improvement ♪ ♪ decorations ♪ ♪ help me impress her relations ♪ ♪ sugar bears and rainbow jelly ♪ ♪ spread those colors on my belly ♪ ♪ on the floor and up the log ♪ ♪ please don't notice I'm a dog ♪ Ha ha! Yeah! - This plan is perfect. - You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so - sure, man. - Come on. - Trust me, homey! - No, no, no. New plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then... Jake? Aah! Let's hide and burn the house down! - Hello? - Annyong. Haseyo. Jake, is that you? Uh-huh. Are you going to let us in? Yeah. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Aah! I can explain! I can explain! Ohh! He's so handsome! Oh, Bob! Our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love. You think I'm a rainicorn? I think we could spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind. Well, we are a little blind. Yes, I guess we are a little blind. Uh... Well, hey, come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both. - Your house is very colorful. - Ha! The plan is working, homey. Jake, what is that thing - that's talking? - Uh... That's, um... I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate. Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance. ♪ Heyumbawey ♪ ♪ hoo hum boo goo ♪ Jake, please ask your goblin Butler to stop insulting my - heritage. - Uh... Yes! Get out of here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn - snacks! But... Come on, homey. Help me. Ha! You got it, homey. Uh, please, c-come upstairs. My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment. Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the crystal dimension. Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter. - Ethel. - Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob. I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd. Well, he's actually a human. Oh, Bob! Our future son-in-law must be filthy rich to afford a human Butler! Shh. Thank you, Jake, for being - interested in our daughter. - Uh... No problem, Bob. Oh! Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games! Jake, do you know - kabaladapawumba-pbht! - Uh... S-say it again? Kabaladapawumba-pbht! Oh! Kabladapuwama-pbht! I thought you said kobloderagut-pbht! But, aw, man, I love getting down and dirty with some klabladapuwama-pbht! Ha! You all should go first, though. Mm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Kabaladapawumba-pbht! Oh, Bob! Ha ha! - Your turn, Jake! I... Snacks! Get your snacks! Finn! Dude, I have to show lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! - I need homey help. - Hmm. I got a plan, broham. Just stretch your horn at me, - and I'll take care of the rest. - You're the best, homey. - Homeys help homeys. - Ha ha! Kabladapuwama-pbht! Very unusual color palette, Jake. Yes. Subtle. - Whoo! Oh, yeah! Finn? How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy? I, uh... Oh, um... - Let's do it! - Let the games begin! I'm sorry! Yo, my bad! I'll get him! Ooh. Hey, man. How's it going? - It's going crud cow! - I know, I know. I'm sorry. But they really like me. - Your plan is working perfectly! - Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! - Not in the plan! - Look, Finn, you know I got your back "forevah," but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homey. Homeys help homeys. Hey, guys! You ready to get this game going again? Oh, no. We're pooped. Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in. Whoa, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you. Homey, help me cook something, - please. - Okay. Thanks, Finn. Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste. What? Wow! So wealthy and so generous! Oh, I was hoping, but I was afraid to ask. Whoa. I can't wait. - Oh, I can't wait. - What? Whoa! Aah! Jake! I think they want to eat me! Of course we do! Jake said you'd make a great - lunch. - Jake, come on! Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man! Aaah! Knock it off, Bob! - Don't you touch him! - Wait! Come on! Stop it, guys! Come on, y'all! I said stop! Raaaaaah! Now, that's enough! Nobody's eating Finn! He's not my Butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend! I'm sorry I let the lies get so far out of hand. I just got so scared of losing lady. But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies. You're a dog? Yeah, I just... Oh, look.

That's flippin' awesome. - Finn. - Wha? Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about trying to eat you. It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct. - Oh. - So this isn't human? Oh, no. This is soy people. Oh. Mmm! I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference. Ew. Soy? Finn, you're delicious! Oh, man!
