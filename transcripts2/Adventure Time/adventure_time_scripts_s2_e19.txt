 Happy birthday! Jake? Is that you? I can't see. Right. That's because... I'm blind! Jake, I'm blind on my birthday! No, dude, you're blindfolded. - Oh. - Keep the blindfold on. I've got a surprise for you. Surprise! Orange blindfold?

 That is a surprise! That's not the surprise. This is. You got me a train? Thank you, Jake! This isn't the gift. Huh? We have to take the train to get to the gift. Oh. Almost as cool as a free train. Eh. I'll go get the tickets. Okay. Hey, Mr. Conductor!

 It's my birthday! Oh? Climb aboard my train, little boy. You're my new friend. All aboard! This is gonna be the best birthday ever. I'm gonna go grab a schedule. Whoa! Oh, t-terribly sorry, Colonel. Oh, oh, well, that's all right. Just don't let it happen again. Sorry about that, folks. We are approaching Gumball Gulch now. The ride's gonna get a little bumpy until we reach the straightaway, so you might want to buckle up. Found a schedule. Great. Now find your seatbelt. Geez Louise. Uh, s-sorry about that, Colonel. B-Beg your pardon. Oh, sorry. Uh... whoa! Ugh! Aah! Colonel, I am so sorry. Hey, we're in the straightaway. Ooh, I want to see. I'm gonna kill you! Aah! Aah! Aah! A skeleton. Is he going to be okay, Dr. Donut? He doesn't look good. Hey, man, this is kind of a bad scene. Maybe we should get off this train and hoof it to your surprise. Are you kidding? It's a murder mystery on a train, and we're gonna solve it. All right. What do you think, Dr. Donut? Any clues? Hmm. I think it was the guy who screamed, "I'm gonna kill you." Uh, no, no, it... it... it wasn't me. I swear! Passengers, passengers, I don't think it was Colonel Candycorn. Oh, well, well, thank you. No, in murder mysteries, it's never the first person you think of... Never, ever. So, who do you think it is? Colonel, do you have any enemies on this train? Well, uh... well, just one. And his or her name is... See? I knew it wasn't him. But now we have to figure out who his enemy is. It could be anybody. It could even be you. Yes, it could, except I didn't do it. But we don't know that. You singled me out to take suspicion off yourself. Are you Colonel Candycorn's enemy? What? No. I was just trying to join in on the conversation. Suspect numero uno! Rat traps. I really thought I was on to something. Now, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but what about the conductor? No, it's definitely not him. Aw. Why not? Because he's weird and creepy, and you never suspect the creepy guy because it's too obvious. Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule. We're running out of suspects. And we're running out of time. Attention. Attention, passengers. Gnarly. Yeah. Hi. It's me... the conductor. Anyway, I couldn't help overhearing that someone here thinks I'm weird and creepy. And, you know, I'm not weird and creepy. I'm cool and awesome. Happy birthday, Finn. Hey, Jake? Yeah? The conductor was just here, and he was weirder and creepier than before. What?! No way. He was cool and awesome. Anyway, it's still not him. No, the murderer is right here among us. Isn't that right, doctor? You think it was me? When Candycane guy was murdered, you diverted suspicion towards Colonel Candycorn, then killed him to protect your alibi. Are you kidding? Dude, I think you're way off. Am I? Or am I way on? Son of a... My hunches aren't getting me anywhere. The killer is laughing at us, Jake. What do you think we should do? Hmm. We need hard evidence. Ha! A basket of eggs, fish, and cabbage. It's a receipt from an earlier train ride, from another train. Jake, I found a book. It's a dictionary. It's sheet music! It doesn't make any sense to me. Me neither. Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us. Yes! Jake, that's it. It's all so clear now. Gather everyone in the caboose, and I will reveal a murderer. You're the only remaining passengers, so the murderer is in this caboose. Let me explain how I know who the murderer is. I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music, sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl, a song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy. Before Colonel Candycorn died, Dr. Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish, and eggs. And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks. And you, Chocolate Bar Guy... Does this dictionary look familiar, a dictionary which happens to contain the words "rid," "guests," "at once." But the real murderer is someone no one suspects. The real murderer is... No one was the murderer? The conductor's still on the train. Oh, yeah. He did it. Yay! You did it! You solved it, Finn! I knew it... because he's creepy. What?! Hmph. I know... you knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it without you, you, you, you. Thank you. We make a great team, pal. You feel kind of bony. Aah! Jake? No! Hey. How could you murder all those candy people? And you murdered Jake on my birthday! Yes, and you're next. Wrong. Grr! Hunh! Unh! Mnh! No!! Ah! Unh! I'm coming for you! Unh! Ugh! This is for Jake! Hunh! Unh! Hyah! You're going down, or both of us are going down. My birthday wish is vengeance! Happy birthday to me! Wait! Y-You're alive! You were the conductor the whole time? Yep. You were so busy focused on the murders that you never even noticed. The skeletons were the hardest part. Aah! Aah! Aah! It was all an elaborate setup for your birthday present. So nobody was murdered? Nope, not unless you count the train's control panel. Aah! Aah! Aah! Dude, open your eyes. Hey, we're alive! ♪ ...to you ♪ Wow. This is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake. You deserve it, buddy, 'cause you're a great friend. I think my favorite part was landing on the gelatin. That must have taken forever to plan. Nope. That part was a total accident. Oh. So we could have... - Died horribly? Yes. Happy birthday, pal!
