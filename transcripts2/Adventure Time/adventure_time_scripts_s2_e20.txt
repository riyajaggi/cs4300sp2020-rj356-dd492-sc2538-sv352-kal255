 Hey, man, it's couples-only movie night tonight. Who are you bringing? I don't know. Who are you bringing? I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude. Oh. I'll take this duck. It's couples night. You got to bring somebody you can smooch. Man, I don't wanna be smooched. Don't have to smooch. Just have to bring somebody you can smooch.

 It's like the rules. Lame. Aah! Well, I'll take this blanket. Put the blanket down. Have a seat. I want to explain some "things" to you about couples. So, you all square? - Yeah, yeah. Who you gonna call? I'm going to call a girl that I don't have to kiss. - Hello? - Hi, Princess. Would you go to couples movie night with me? Sounds romantic, Finn. No! I-I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me.

 No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship. - But... - Auf wiedersehen. - She doesn't want to go. - Yeah, she does. We just need to help her to realize she wants to go to the movies with you. I'm calling Marceline. - What? - Look, man... I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realize now that my fear was based on ignorance. Speak. Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, babe. We want to make Princess Bubblegum jealous so she'll go to the movies with Finn. Marceline? Come in. Hello? Aah! Are you gonna help us? Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny. Okay, so, here's the plan... You start saying things, and you start laughing way loud. And then Bubblegum... will get jealous of you, which will awaken her Finn love. You start us off. Um... Hmm. Funny. Funny. Um... Giddyup? Um... diggy-diggy? Diggy-diggy! Diggy-diggy! Greetings, Finn. Hey, Marceline. Hello, Bonnibel. Yeah, yeah. So, what's so funny, Finn? I, um, uh... it's, uh, something. Well, then keep it down out there. I'm trying to whistle practice. That was great. Now we begin phase two. It's so powerful. Wait here. Hey, look, Finn... I know Jake's your friend and all, but if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've got to, like, stop listening to your dog and take some advice from a real girl. But Jake said phase two is powerful. Pbht! How is Jake gonna know what girls want more than a real girl? - Yeah... - Okay, great. So, what we need now is something... fun. Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun. If you can show Bubblegum that you're fun, she'll defs want to go to the movies with you. You said "fun" so much. It sounds all weird now. "F-F-Fun." "F..." So, what do you like to do for fun, Finn? Oh! Oh! I like to wrestle and fight! Grr! Roar! Girls don't like that. No, no, that's perfect. All you got to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum and show her how fun you are. "Fun-n-n." "Fun-n-n-n." Whoa. Where you going, man? Check it out. What is that stuff? It's a lute suit. Girls love it. Trust me. Finn, what the plum are you wearing? You look horrible. It's a lute suit. And Finn looks adorable in it. Well, it's going to ruin the plan. What's she talking about, Finn? Well, I was gonna give Marceline's idea a try, too. Her idea? What's wrong with my idea? Oh, hey, Finn. Did you ever find some... Whoa. What are you wearing? Oh, this is my... lute suit. Uh... Oh, this is my... ♪ lute suit ♪ Finn! That is hilarious. Oh, you are killing me. Psst. Grr-rr! Oh, yeah. So... Headlock! Grr! Aah! Ugh! Aah! Guards! That suit was ridiculous. Ridi... ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can you? I guess the suit did feel a little silly. Well, fine. You can just give it back, then. I'm sorry. Good luck getting to that movie without my help. Harumph. Gee, he seems pretty ticked. Nah, he just needs some spaghetti. Oh, okay. Well, taste this, then... I got a new plan. Really? The only thing women love more than fun is excitement. She needs to feel her blood pump, man. She needs to be chased by wolves. Like, metaphorically? Come on, I'll teach you how to show a girl a good time. Hold tight. You ready? Uh... mm-hmm. Shh. She's probably asleep. This was a really good idea. Now don't blow it this time. Okay. Aah! Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room! Yeah, I know. I put them there. Pretty exciting, right? I'm sorry to do this, Finn, but until you stop acting like a psycho, you are forbidden from entering The Candy Kingdom. Farewell. I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. Shh. Come on, Finn... a brainlord like Bonnie? You'd be bored with her in a week. And anyway, I, for one, think you're pretty great. I'm sorry it didn't work out like you wanted. I'll see you later, I guess. Marceline. Of course! It's been Marceline all along. Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti? Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help. 'Bout time! Uh-oh. ♪ Diddle lee bown, dowm-dowm ♪ ♪ Diddle lee bown, bah bah bah ♪ Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me?! We need to talk. ♪ Good evening, my dear ♪ ♪ Your escort is here ♪ Finn, you do not want to go down that road with me. With you, I would walk down any road, milady, especially if it leads to the movies. Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movie with... this! What do you think of me now?! How do you like your popcorn? Ugh! You're starting to annoy me. Well, then let's do something fun, like to go the movies! Get off me. Finn, I like you, but... Headlock! No! Listen to me. I'm not gonna go to the movies with you. I just don't like you that way. I'm sorry, Finn. I just... I don't want to date you. Date me? Man, I just want to go to the movies, but everybody hates me. Wait... you don't want me to be your girlfriend? Huh? No! Movies! If you weren't looking for a girlfriend, then why were you romancing it up all day? 'cause Jake said couples nights have weird kissing requirements and romance-initiation rituals and whatever else. I didn't really say all that. Of course I'll go with you, Finn. - You will? - Yeah, as friends. Of course as friends. But no tongue. Ye... what?! Oh, man, I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie. Oh, mon cher, I guess this is goodbye. No, not goodbye. Let's say... farewell! Ugh! Couples night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor of getting the plop out of here? There's nothing I'd like more. Aah! Nothing can ever tear us apart. Yeah!
