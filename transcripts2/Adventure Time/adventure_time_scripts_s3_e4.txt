 Oh. Sis, give me the phone. Oh, hey, Finn. I've got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great. Thanks. Ice King! How many times have we warned you about using love potion? That's why I'm using honey. Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways. Yeah, you stink so much,

 I'm gonna ground you for a week. What?! You can't do that! You're grounded for two weeks! You're grounded for two weeks! Three weeks. Oh, snaps! Why?! I didn't do anything! Four weeks? Fine! But I'm only gonna do it for a week! That just grounded you for four weeks. Oh, dang! Okay. What's up with the peace sign?! Oh. No, I-I was just trying to show you how many weeks you got. Get out of here, bubble butt! Awesome. Aaaaaaaaaaah! This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded, not me! Ooh! I'm so mad I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle. "H... I... T... M... A... N..." Ooh! Perfect. "Dear, Mr. Scorcher. I would like you to hit two people. Neat name, by the way. Love, the Ice King." Aah! Whoa, you are fast! And quiet. And very good at dramatic silence. I like it. All right! So, how do we do this? Uh, we shake hands, or... aah! Oh-ho! Paperwork. "Finn and Jake." Whoosh! Aha. There he is. Huh? What's he doing? What the... I hired a hitman, not a fireman! Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? Mine's whack. Well, put some meat in there. Huh. What kind of meat is that? That's Meat Man's meat. Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat? I don't know. I can't read his mind. Phoo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o! You guys, I... What do you think "grounded" means?! It's wasted, man! Oh, great! Now see what you did to my buddy?! So help me, Ice King! Okay, okay. Ghal! It's all right, buddy. We can make another. Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting. Hey, there you are. What's that? I already signed that. I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive, you big dummy! Ghal! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire. You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Blah! Hey, wha? Punch, punch. Punch. Rainicorn, don't eat him. Ice winds, blow! Blo-o-o-o-o-o-o-w! Blo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-w! Meat Man... Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man. I-I didn't mean it, man. Finn and Jake, I am just a dream! I was never here. Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience! How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them... On the shoulder, or something. Are you even listening? Oh, I get it. Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake. You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay. I'll play this game. How about this prize piece for your pad? ♪ I wanna live, live, live ♪ ♪ I wanna live, live, live ♪ No-o-o-o-o-o-o! Huh. Okay. How about these bad boys... Night vision x-ray goggles for when you have a lady houseguest? Aw! Come on! At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses. What about Lumpy Space Princess? Ghost Princess? I can't even hold her with my love mitts. Aw, geez! Uh... Huh. Oh! A-A leg cramp, in my leg! Ow, ow! O-Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back. Ow! Ow! Think, baby. Come on. Ah! All right, let's hit the hitman, right? There's got to be a... Ah! "Blastronaut... ♪1 solution for all hitman problems." Sheesh! $99.95?! That's nuts! "Scor... cher." Sweet! No! Come back, you wussy! Ooh, that was weird. Was that your friend, or something? Look! A supermodel! Look! A hoverboard! Look! The apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boingloings. Hit in the boingloings! Boingloings! Boingloings! Somebody got hit in them. Peace out! Oh! Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt! Hey, Finn, are you awake yet? I'm trying. I had a dream about Meat Man. Oh, yeah? I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. Aah! Oh! You're grounded! I know, but shush! Okay. I hired a guy to kill you by accident. What?! I thought he was gonna just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch. Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now, 'cause he's made out of fire... or he commands fire, maybe? Good job. Good job, The Ice King. Oh, my life! Aah! Hyah! Come on, man! Let's get out of here! Jake, do something! He's getting close! Yah! Go faster, man! Oof! You alive? Uh, I think so. Whew! That was close! Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long. What do we do? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hm. Ooh! Got it! I'm gonna kill you guys. Hey, I'll kill you! No, wait a minute, you two! I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up... good as new. No way, man! You already messed up enough stuff! You'll probably kill us, too! Yeah! We don't trust you! Zap! You'll thank me later. Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself! Dead, dead, dead! Dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses. So, uh, looks like you can go home now. Aah! Oh, yeah. O-Of course. There. Oh, glad all that's over. Hey, guys, guess what. You're grounded... underneath my butt! ♪ Come along with me ♪ ♪ and the butterflies and bees ♪ ♪ We can wander through the forest ♪ ♪ and do so as we please ♪ ♪ Come along with me ♪ ♪ to a cliff under a tree ♪ This party is so crazy!
