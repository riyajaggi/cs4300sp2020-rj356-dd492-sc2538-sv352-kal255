It's not a party without streamers! ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪ ♪ Doo-doo-doo ♪ Dude! This isn't a party! We got to get you out of here. Hey! Jake, help me! It's starting! These crazy bears don't know they're in danger! Well, we should go. Jake, wait! We have to help them. They're partying. They're fine. Okay, Jake. What happens when you eat food? Well, it goes into your stomach. Ye-e-e-e-ah? And then it stays there for a bit. And then it turns into... They're all gonna turn into the stuff! Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. I don't know why you don't know this, but y'all are partyin' in a monster's stomach. Thanks! I love dancing! No! Y'all... Are partyin'... In a monster's... stomach! I think he wants to know where the bathroom is! It's over there! Hey! I'm Cubby. Hi, Cubby. What's going on? I heard what you said... About this being a monster's belly. I've been telling everyone that for three days! Why won't they listen? 'Cause I'm just a kid! Cubby! Are you bothering these guys with your fantasy stories? No! I wasn't! I swear! I'm dancing. See? See?! Hmm. Cubby, is there anything we can do to help? You could talk to Party Pat. "Party Pat"? He's our Chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow. Can you take us to him? Sure! He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood water bed. This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys! Bye, Cubby! Bye! Uh... We're looking for Party Pat? Oh. Uh... Well, listen, I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk. It's pretty important, actually. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. You know who I am? You're... Party Pat? I'm the Chief. Ri-i-i-i-ght. Right. You're the Chief. Shh. Before you talk to the Chief... you must party with the Chief. But... It is the only way. ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ So turn up the music, and we'll never leave ♪ ♪ Better believe ♪ ♪ We'll never run from the fun, because we're ♪ ♪ Bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears, bears ♪ ♪ be-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ars! ♪ Dude, we've been partying for hours. Yeah. He keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks! How's your nausea? Full-blown. Hang in there, pal. Hey, Party Pat. You're the Chief, and I totes respect that. But what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk. But you haven't been partying. What?! You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling and open one's mind eye. I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals. This is just a sticker. You can stay in our cave as long as you want. That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cave! Y'all are partyin' in a monster's belly! Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. So you'll tell everyone to leave? Nah, we love it here. But you're all gonna die if you stay! Attention. Attention, everybody. Can I have your attention, please? So... apparently we're not in a cave. - We're not in a cave? - What did he say? I always thought we were in a cave. We're in a... monster's belly! It's kind of peaceful. All those bears are gonna turn into the stuff. Shh! Seriously, the only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed. But they're not hurtin' nothin'. Yeah. Good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure. Whoa! The monster's headed toward that volcano! Uh-huh. We got to warn the bears! If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us. Oh. Okay. Just follow my lead. ♪ My hot dog's dead ♪ ♪ My pizza's dead ♪ ♪ My cupcake is dead ♪ Oh. Uh. ♪ My donut's dead ♪ ♪ My burger's dead ♪ ♪ My milkshake is dead ♪ ♪ All of our favorite foods are totally dead ♪ ♪ They cannot procreate in little food beds ♪ ♪ We'll eat them up ♪ ♪ And turn them into stuff ♪ ♪ And we'll cry over their graves ♪ ♪ But you can't cry enough ♪ ♪ When you miss someone you love, you can't cry enough ♪ You bears got to get out of here, or you're all gonna be melted by lava! Party Pat, do you know of another exit? Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore. He must be talking about the butt intestines. Come on, Jake! We got to get out of here! One more bandage. Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat! Y'all can party out here now. No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent. You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. Hmm. Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat! Party... Pancakes. Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more! Prithee, take us upon thine gut, and we shall party no more with fireworks, but instead with gentle lasers! Hey, Jake, wait up!
