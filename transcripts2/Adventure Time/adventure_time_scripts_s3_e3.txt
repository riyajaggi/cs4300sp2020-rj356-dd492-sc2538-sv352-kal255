 Because she's in trouble! Who is? Marceline! Faster, Jake! She's in trouble! Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline? I'm... her spirit animal. Oh. Marceline! What's wrong with her?! She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber. Tell us how to break the spell. I'll transport you into Marceline's mind, where you will walk through her memories

 and find the memory core. Then what? Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality. But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself? Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms... just legs. Oh, yeah. Here we go. Ungh! What? What did you do to my forehead? When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here. Take this. It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head. Like this? Yep. Like that. Feel sleepy? Mm-hmm. Good. Sleep now. - But know this! - Huh?! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever! And ever! And ever! Did it work? I-I can't tell. I don't feel like I'm inside Marceline's memories. Me neither. Huh? Whoa! Whoa! So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline? Hmm. There she is! Hey, Li'l Marcy. Who are you guys? - We're Finn and Jake. - We're your friends. Hambo is my only friend. See? You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor. Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still. I'm hurting you because I love you. What are you guys still doing here? We're trying to wake you up. Do you know where your memory core is? Nope. But there might be anything behind that cellar door. And it rhymes with "memory core." Ooh! Ooh! Could be jams and pickles down there! Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory... with food in it. Ooh! Ice cream! I want some! Huh? Come on, Finn. Yo, man. Wha?! Don't eat those. Bluh! Marceline! Daddy? Why? Hmm. - What? It's our tree house. This must be when Marceline lived here. Easy. Easy. You got it? Yeah. Aah! I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash. Yeah, me too. Oh, hey. Wait. Watch this. I've been practicing. Marceween! I wuv! I wuv! Oh, Ash. Who's this guy supposed to be? Ash, I guess. This place reeks. Yo, man. Your thing is glowing. My what? Oh, my thing. We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on. Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again. Hey. O-Open your eyes. Look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand. These cherry blossoms... look. Look as close as you can, and they're real. Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing? Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much... to a witch. You what?! Are you crazy?! That was my favorite thing in the whole world! That's why it's so valuable, genius... For potions. You're not... a genius. You're not... a genius. That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you've ruined my life! But... but not all of it! It's over, you psycho! This way, Finn! Check out this whacked-out memory crack! It's banaenae down here! The core! All these orbs must be her memories! - How are we supposed to know which one to grab? - Play "hot/cold" with your forehead. - All right. Hot or cold? - Cold. Definitely cold. Warmer. Hyup! Ungh! Warmer. Warmer! Whoa! Hot! Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one! Wha? Hey! You have arms! That's right, genius. Huh? You lied to us! Ah, the important thing is Marceline's awake. Marcy! Marcy! You're okay! Quit touching my hair! You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend. That's Ash. Ash?! He's not my friend. He's my boyfriend! What?! That's right, babe. Ash, what's going on? Just picking up my girl for a night on the town... at my place. Aw, that's sweet. What?! Oh, grow up, you guys. I'm gonna go freshen up. That's a relief. Oh, Ash. Wha-a-a-a-t?! Don't you guys get it? I out-brained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our breakup! It's over, you psycho! That's enough of that. Oh, no! What?! Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar. Let's go. No! Marceline! Ashicus flyicus. They're gone, man! He took her! Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent! Follow me. This is it? I can smell 'em in there. So, what's the plan? Um... okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed till Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline. Nice. Aah! My house! What's happening?! Wha? No! Don't hurt me! No! No, sorry! Ju... Shh! Shh! Wait! Aah! Help! Somebody help me! What's all this hullabaloo?! Help! Help! Hey, hold it! You! Get back here! Oof! Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here. Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, Marceline. I'll go. I've just got to show you something first.

Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you loved so much... to a witch. It's over, you psycho! Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.
