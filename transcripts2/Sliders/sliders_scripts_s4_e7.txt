 Man, get off my back! Get your face off my neck! I can't see anything. Would you get your elbow out of my ear? After Colin moves his face! Stop moving! Oh, great. Great. This is great. Now we're sliding into closets. What's next, landing inside a brick wall? Can that happen? Not a chance. There's a densitometry circuit that...

 That if you ask me, needs a lot of work. Well, nobody asked you! Q- Ball, how long we here for? Nine hours. Instead of arguing, wouldn't you rather try to find out where we are? Why can't we do both? Look. I need a drink. Yeah, me, too. Where'd this come from? Is it my imagination or does Maggie and my brother argue a lot? Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. You do what we do, you get a little tense at times. Yeah, but this morning she called him a name I never even heard of. Well, she used to be a Marine.

 What do we have here? Zucchini juice? Beet frappé? Frozen okra whip? What is this, Health Nut Earth? The broccoli and soda sounds good. I don't see why you're blaming me. You're the one who broke the law. I swatted a mosquito! On a world where you knew it was an endangered species! How the hell was I supposed to know that? You're gonna tell me you did not see one of the signs? And I think the cop would've let you off with a warning if you hadn't yelled at her. That was not yelling! You haven't heard yelling. Hey, Quinn, I wouldn't call it yelling. Thanks for the support, bro. Thank you very much. You see that? There you have it. Even your own brother thinks you're wrong. Hi, my name's Damon. Can I be of assistance? No. Why the negativity? I'm your friend. Okay, then why don't you mind your own business, friend? The difference is, you... Ma'am, I'm a licensed facilitator, and I think your dosage needs a little adjustment. I think your nose needs a little adjustment! I think you're yelling again. That is not yelling. That is not yelling! This is yelling! This is "I really don't want to hear about it. " And this is, "You are gonna finish this discussion with me right now!" Maggie? Maggie? Maggie, what happened? What did you do to her? What's wrong with her? Maggie? Can you hear me? Wow. Quinn. What if you found a portal to a parallel universe? What if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it's the same year and you're the same person, but everything else is different? And what if you can't find your way home? Easy. Easy does it. Easy does it, easy as pie, pie is good and so am I. She seems better than before. Oh, I am better than ever. As a matter of fact, I feel like dancing. Anybody care to join me? Uh, Maggie? What is this? What did you give her? Tranquol. Standard mood elevator. Why? She needed it. I'd say you do, too. Colin! That's a little dart. Isn't that clever? Hey, I don't understand your aggressive behavior. Testosterone imbalance? Quinn, have you ever wondered why we have so many fingers? Colin, listen to me. I am. You sound orange. You have to... What? He's hearing colors. And seeing sounds. And tasting aromas. It's fantastic, man. It's like I'm one with the universe. You are so cute! Okay. Okay. Okay. Look, look, look. Just remember you're still with friends, all right? Yeah. If it gets spooky, just let me know, I'll talk you through it. Have you seen things like this before? Yeah. Once or twice. See? Nothing to worry about. Everything's fine. Where's Maggie? You look. I'll stay here with finger boy. Okay. Oh, man! Maggie! Maggie? It's Quinn. You still think everything is fine? I don't get it. Tranquol shouldn't do this. Our clinic's on the next block. Has she had a reaction to Tranquol before? She's never taken any. Never? Most unusual. Well, let's see what she is taking. No infuser? Well, you have one, don't you? Infuser? Uh, medication dispenser. No, we don't have those. How's that possible? We're not from around here. But I thought everybody was using infusers these days. Well, not quite. There are still some more primitive parts that are dispensing medications orally. Areas of Canada, for example. Yeah. That's right. We're a bit behind the times up there. Uh, so you don't know what her regular prescription is? I'm afraid not. Well, then we better play it safe and just neutralize all the drugs in her system with a dose of Troxoprine. Oh, it's pharmaceutical grade. Not the impure bootleg street stuff. Nothing to worry about. You keep saying that. Okay. It shouldn't take long to do its work. In the meantime, uh, why don't you just stay here and relax and... Is she gonna be all right? Absolutely. Absolutely. Be just a sec. I'm not sure, but I think it's Quinn Mallory. No, but I do have his companion under restraints. Okay, uh... I'll do the best I can, but get here quickly, okay? Thanks. Damon, the DEA doesn't want us to wait, so I'll distract him and you tranq him, okay? Whew. It's about time. Where's Maggie? I'll tell you later. We've got to move. How's Colin? He's coming down. He had a little snack so he passed out. All right. Well, then we'll have to carry him because we cannot stay here. Okay, don't tell me. Our little friend with the happy darts is coming back? With reinforcements. Yes, that's the man. That's Mallory, all right. Busted twice for non-possession. Jumped bail a year ago and ran off to Mexico. I'd heard he died of an underdose. Same here. Guess we were wrong, huh? It's a safe bet that Mallory snuck back into the country to spread more of his anti-drug propaganda. A guy like that shouldn't be on the street. He'll be apprehended, sir. Let's move out. Where's Mallory's partner in crime? Oh. Right this way. I did a complete blood work-up on her and apparently she's never had any significant pharmacotherapy. Nothing? Nothing. Nothing at all? Poor, dumb kid. Think everybody's on something? Everybody but us. Well, that explains the brain-dead grins. What it doesn't explain is what they have against the local Quinn. He's obviously no friend of the powers that be. We find him, maybe he helps us spring Maggie. Yeah. Well, we're gonna need help, especially with Colin out of the play. How long is he gonna sleep like this? I knew a roadie once who crashed for three days. Didn't even twitch when the drummer set him on fire. Somebody set him on fire? It wasn't on purpose. Hold on. Hold on. Signs of life. Hey, hey? How do you feel? And please don't say "hungry. " I feel... I feel ordinary. Lost touch with the universe? All the sensations are gone. Good. Not good. I want more. No, you don't. Yes, I do. I mean, you've gotta try it. It's important to experience new sensations. Science demands it. Yeah, well, the next time science calls, don't answer. Oh, there he is. Who? Hey! Come back here! More! I want more! Colin! Get back here! Colin! Colin, wait up! More! Please, give me more! Come on, give... Colin? There they are! Tranq them! Let's go! Now talk to me. How did Mallory get back across the border? Now why won't you enlighten me? Loosen these straps and I'll enlighten you but good! No can do, honey, you'd hurt yourself. Not before I hurt you! Well, now. A woman with spirit. We'll fix that. We certainly will. I've got a prescription here that will take care of those anti-social impulses you're experiencing. And your system is all ready for it now. Oh, no. You stay away from me, lady. No! This won't hurt a bit. Yes. No! Yes. Much better. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. There we go. You sleep tight. Good. Yes. Agent Lowell, sir? I'm sorry, sir. The other two got away. Well, what have we here? Well, he says he's Quinn's brother. Colin Mallory. And you are? Fletcher Lowell, Special Agent, Drug Empowerment Administration. Tell me, Colin, how did your brother get here? The same way I did. We slid through an inter-dimensional gateway vortex wormhole thingamabob. Is that a fact? Yeah. My brother invented it. He's a genius from a parallel universe. I am also from such a place. Very different from this world. Been drug-deprived a tad too long, haven't you, Colin? Based on recent experiences, I'd have to say yeah! Oh, hi, Maggie. Hmm? Is that where they have Maggie? There's the drugmobile. They must've brought Colin here, too. Yeah. Just like you figured. Less than six hours. So, what's the plan? Give me a minute to think. We don't have a minute. Hi. Hi. We've gotta go get them. Whoa, whoa, whoa. They almost got us last time. This time they're ready. Okay! Follow that van! Why? I'm in a good space right now. A really mellow mindset. Come on, man. Start the car! Hey. Maybe that'd get you started. Whoa, I hear you! But the heavy-duty materialist bag is not where I'm coming from. I can't get behind it. You better get behind that wheel! Stay loose. You're gonna make me forget my mantra. We don't have that long. I'm gonna go in. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not going back in there? Why not? The doctor's gone. Maybe her office has some record of where they're taking Colin and Maggie. You'd think a place like this would have more security. I don't even see an alarm system. No. No cameras either. Okay. Do we break the glass or pick the lock? I don't even see a lock. Okay, she doesn't care about her magazines. But she'll lock up her office, right? Possibly not. I guess with everybody so blissed out, they don't have a huge crime problem. They may not even have cops here. Just paramedics with tranquilizer guns and... Remmy? Whoa! Your double needs a haircut. Haircut and a bath. Staying off drugs won't hurt you, people. There's nothing dangerous about getting low. So don't listen to the lies of the government and the pharmaceutical conglomerates. Tune out, turn off and drop in, people. Do you hear me? Am I getting through? Hmm, so that's why they don't like you. Yeah. I'm an anti-drug agitator. "Last known whereabouts, Ensenada. " And that was months ago. If the DEA can't find him, how are we gonna? Odds are, we won't. But at least we'd be able to find Maggie and Colin. Oh, wait a minute. "Transferred this date to Reorientation Compound Four. " Doesn't sound good. Is there an address? Yeah. 1402 Elm Street. This is a rather upscale neighborhood for a Reorientation Compound. Here's 1402. No guards, no gates. Doesn't seem right. Where's the Beaver? Oh. Hello, again. Honey, we've got company. Quinn, Remmy! How marvelous to see you. So good of you boys to drop by. What is this? Reorientation. You're stoned out of your skulls. You say that like it's a bad thing. It is. Maggie, that stuff almost killed you. Oh, please! That dosage was all wrong. But they fixed that now. We appreciate your concern, but we're fine. We feel good about ourselves. Really good. And that's why we've decided to stay. You what? We decided that we're not going to slide with you. Look, you're in no shape to make decisions. Well, you're not gonna force us to leave, are you? Whoo! No, no, of course not. Oh, heaven forbid. Good. Well, then why don't you sit down. Sit down. Make yourselves comfortable. Okay? That's it. Now Maggie's gonna make you some hot cocoa. Oh! I'll help you, dear. Goody! Four more hours and Maggie's making cocoa. We're just gonna have to play along until they slide. Then carry them out. I don't think they'll go for it. They'll thank us later. They don't look happy. No, they don't. We have to help them. I totally agree. They'll thank us later. Cocoa! Yummy, yummy cocoa bunny. There, boys. Look, are they giving you this reading material? Drugs are your Friends. Domestic Bliss Made Easy. Illustrated History of Psychopharmacology. We just started that one. The first chapter's on Sigmund Freud, the father of modern pharmacotherapy. He was studying dreams or something, But then he discovered lithium. Threw all his previous work away and started all over as a biochemist. Oh, come on! Let's go. Oh! All units, we have a medical alert at Compound Four, Unit 1402. We have reason to believe the fugitives may be there. All units respond. Oh, great. Colin, Maggie, come on out! We can't stand violence. Bully! It's all over! Would you two get out here? Hey, we gotta go! Well, what about them? You think you can drag them along and outrun these guys? Come on. We'll come back later. Say again? Mallory struck him? Yes, sir. Fortunately, he's all right. It's my fault. I should've gotten here faster. Post a lookout, then hustle back here. Right. Damon's gonna need some help to tackle Mallory. Doctor, whip up a cartridge of Decimide. Is that really necessary? Mallory's become violent. The fastest way to nail a sociopath like that is to fight fire with fire. Agent Lowell, you are asking me to give Damon a drug that could be lethal. I'm not asking you. I'm ordering you. Well... I'll do as you say, but I'm having difficulty coping with that. Physician, heal thyself. You're absolutely right. It's time for extra-strength Tranquol. Four out of five doctors recommend it. It won't be easy dragging those two through the slide. Even if we can, what happens when their infusers run out? Serious withdrawal. It won't be pretty. It could be dangerous. We might slide into a world where they don't know how to treat it. So we gotta get them detoxed before we slide? Yeah. When Maggie had her system cleaned out, the doctor used something called Troxoprine. Sneaking back into that clinic twice, pushing our luck. Wouldn't help anyway. Troxoprine's something even these people keep locked up. But Damon said there was a black market for the stuff. Maybe we could find some on the street. Worth a shot. Now look, Damon, here's the bottom line. Mallory is a menace. His drug-starved mind's blown all its fuses. Taking him down's gonna require a volunteer with some starch in his shorts. I'd like to volunteer, sir. Good. Now, the doctor's gonna give you a mild stimulant. Now, it's gonna rev you up enough so you can use force to bring in Mallory. Now, I know it's extreme... No. If you think it's necessary, sir, that's good enough for me. You're all right, kid. This is nice. Yes, isn't it? No conflicts. No aggression. Just a sense of peace and well-being. Mmm-hmm. Except... Except what? Aren't you happy? Oh, yeah, I'm happy, but I don't know. Shouldn't we be doing something? We're doing what we're supposed to be doing. Adjusting to our medication. And experiencing a more enjoyable lifestyle. And learning new skills. Maybe that's what I need. A new skill. Something to do. Good idea. How about this? Baking? Hmm. I'll try anything once. Troxoprine? I might be able to help you out there. How much you need? Enough for two. Well, how big a dose? You just want to clear your heads a little or get completely clean? Completely clean. Totally grounded, huh? Good choice. You haven't lived till you've kicked. But getting dry ain't cheap. Two Virgin Marys. That runs into money. All right. How much? Well, understand, my product's the best. Guaranteed uncut. How much? Lotta Troxy out there wouldn't scour a lab rat, but I don't touch it. Right. Got a location on Mallory. An alley next to 1125 Gould. He's trying to score some Troxoprine from one of our undercover agents. I'll bring him in, sir. I'm sure you will. Doctor? All right, all right. Get a move on. Get a move on. While you still remember where you're going. You know the last time I authorized a Decimide intervention, it was up in Monterey, in '95. Seal population up there had exploded. Coast Guard was called out to blow the little beggars off the pier with high-pressure hoses. And a bunch of tree-huggers in sandals were ripping out their infusers and lying down right in front of the Guard. We sent in two D'ed-up facilitators. It was just two. There were hippies and baby seals flying all over that harbor. I want you to sign a DI 1029 form right away so I can fax it up to Sacramento. Well, of course. Decimide has never been administered from this facility before, and I will not be held responsible for whatever Damon does out there. Hmm. Now I know you're proud of the therapeutic reputation of this clinic, Helena. But don't worry, your pretty white smock won't get soiled. Hmm. Hmm. Are you sure the Tranquol is kicking in for you? Perhaps I'm developing a tolerance. Well, Doctor, in your position you can't let that happen. I think you better kick up the dose a little, huh? And I don't even make much profit on Troxy. But I like to think I'm making a contribution. Have you got the stuff or not? Well, of course I have it, but we gotta agree on terms first, and I want you to know what you're getting. Look, all we're getting is a run-around. Hey, hey, hey, wait up! Come on. Let's negotiate. Don't you guys wanna make a deal here? Damon? He looks different somehow. That ought to stop him. Yeah. But it won't. What the devil is that guy on? PCP? Crystal meth? We gotta find another way out of here. We can't outrun this guy forever. There's no place to hide! A couple more hours till we slide. Look, maybe we're just gonna have to take him. Maybe you haven't noticed, but this guy's got a bit of an edge. That's fair. Maybe we can take some of that edge away from him. Hey, Damon, how you feeling? That car thing was very impressive. You are one tough guy. Stay back, man. I'm telling you, stay back! I am gonna knock your head off, man! I'm sorry. I'm so... A little help! Get him off me! You've got to be kidding me! If he gets up again, he's all yours. Why haven't we heard anything from him? This is taking too long. Prolonged use of Decimide is hazardous. Doctor, take an attitude adjustment. Oh, God. Is the Tranquol not working? Do you think I need something stronger? Yes. Euphoridine. Here. Yes. Much better. Let me review the bidding here. Car hits him, barrels hit him, I hit him, the floor hits him. Even if he didn't feel it, he's gonna need a hospital. Yeah, I know, but we've gotta try this first. We need his help. If he can just sweat out all those drugs. Yeah. But what if he doesn't? How much time we got left? Two hours. What if he stays hopped up enough to tear us apart? Then we better hope that's a tough chain. Mmm... Delicious. You don't like them. Oh, no. Of course I like them. Colin, you be honest with me. But you worked so hard on it. I wouldn't want to hurt your feelings. I don't think you could. Not while I'm wearing this thing. I forgot. Another benefit of pharmacotherapy. Well, in that case, these are the worst cookies I've ever tasted. You're alive. More or less. Do you remember what happened? I feel like I was hit by a car. Well... It must have been Decimide, but they didn't tell me. I could've killed you both. Yeah. Just don't do it again. Wait a minute. Wait, they lied to me. No, they don't want you brought in, they want you dead. And they were willing to turn me into a murderer! What am I feeling? We like to call it anger. Yeah, but it's so intense. What's wrong with me? Nothing. You're normal. You're clean. Clean? No, no, no. That's dangerous. Not really. Yeah. Sure it is. Sure it is. Look, people die without their prescriptions, okay? Look, I need medicine. I'm scared. I'm actually scared. So this is what it's like? You've never been scared before? Not like this. When you're clean does everything feel so real? Sure. Love, hate, passion, rage. The whole nine yards. And you know what? Some things are actually funny. Lowell says you're violent and out of control. Yet... You could've killed me and you didn't. I was the one who was out of control. He's moved on to guilt. Go for it. All right, listen to me, Damon. We are not a threat to you or anyone else. All we want to do is get Colin and Maggie back and then clear out. Leave the city? Leave the country. It'd probably make Lowell just as happy. I can't go back to work for that guy. Well, then, work with us. What would I have to do? Come on. Watch yourself. God, I've never felt this kind of pain before. Mind if I take an aspirin? I'd take two. Colin? This isn't working. Maybe you should try needlepoint. No, not this. This. What's wrong with it? Don't you find it a little boring? Mmm, no. Maybe I would if I wasn't so content. That's it! That's it! Don't you see? We're not the same people we used to be. So? We're better off this way. We're much happier. Yeah. Yeah, but I think life should be about more than happiness. Why? Hmm. Easy, guys. Easy, guys. They're tranqued and ready for Reorientation. What the hell happened to you? Oh, they, uh, put up a pretty good fight, but I got them. The other two still inside? Right. Good. You can return to your normal duties now. Sure you don't want me to go... See to your other duties, Greg. I'll take care of this. You gonna make it? Now comes the tricky part. Agent Lowell? Sir, it's Damon. Where are you, Damon? Compound Four. Mallory tried to rejoin his friends. I tracked them here. I killed them all, sir. What's your condition? Not good, sir, feverish... Trouble breathing, hard to move. That's side effects of the stimulant. We'll be right there. Oh, God. Okay. She'll bring Troxoprine if I got those symptoms right. Lf? Well, yeah. We only studied Decimide briefly at the academy. It's a drug that's never used. Almost never. Burning up. The drug... Troxoprine... Thank you for making the house call, Doctor. What are you doing? Making sure that that really is Troxoprine. That it cleans him up and not put him to sleep for good. That's absurd! I'm a doctor! Oh, come on! Some doctor! You gave him Decimide without even telling him what it would do to him. I had no choice. I was ordered. Doctor, stop whining. It's so unbecoming. Damon, what say you and me talk? All right. It's Troxoprine, all right. Let's go. Visitors! Hi, everybody. What's that, Damon? A little medical adjustment. Oh, yeah. Goody. We could sure use one, huh, honey? What are you doing, Damon? Stop that! You don't know what it's going to do to them, Damon. I order you to stop this. Damon, I... No, no, no! Now there is going to be a major DEA investigation into all of this. I promise you. And the four of you are gonna go into Max Reorientation. All right. Now put that down right there. Put it down. Put the box down! Open it up. Open it up. And the good doctor is going to lose her license. And you, you had so much promise. You just disappointed me. No! That's Ecstacide. It's much too strong for you. Why did you... Why did you disappoint me, Damon? Oh... This is so amazing. Thanks, Mr. President. All in a good day's work, nothing more. I got a letter from Aunt Irma today. Okay. Your friends are completely clean. If you're sure that's what you want. That's what we want. Okay. No traces of Decimide and no lingering effects. So, uh... It's safe now to put you back on your normal medication. Uh, actually, I think I'm gonna stay clean for a while. It feels interesting. You won't turn me in, will you? No. But, well, you might be making a mistake. Drug therapy isn't perfect, and it could certainly be misused. But... That's an understatement. Look, it made this guy feel like he could walk through walls. Some of us are trying... Some of you better take a hard look at yourselves. Hey, guys. One minute. Oh, I can't wait. Amen to that. Not gonna miss all of that happiness? Zombieness. Liquid zombieness. Hey, you guys want a cab now? I'm back in driving mode. Very direction-oriented. Uh, no, thanks. We've got a ride. So you guys aren't mad at us for detoxing you? Hell no. Thank you! Good. Uh, just a reminder for the next world. Please try not to get us in any trouble. What are you saying? That this was all my fault? Hey! You can't get away with that! They're at it again! One big, happy, sliding family. Wow. This new formula... Outstanding.
