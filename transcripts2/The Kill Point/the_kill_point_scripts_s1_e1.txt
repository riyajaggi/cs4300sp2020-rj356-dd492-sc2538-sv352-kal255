 The Kill Point (2007): Season 1, Episode 1 - Who's Afraid of Mr. Wolf, Part 1 - full transcript 
 'Mr. Wolf' heads a group which executes a well-planned bloodless bank robbery in Pittsburgh. Alas, an FBI agent which happened to be there but kept quiet during shoots at them when they're outside, and an armored car which retrograded to pick up a lost cellphone blocks their way, so they must retreat inside and take hostages as the police lays a siege. PPD officer Horst Cali's cautious attitude is overruled by deputy chief Abrami, leading to a SWAT team casualty. Sergeant 'Wolf' steps outside, strips to his boxers to show his Iraq war wounds and convinces the TV audience the US government hurt his veteran platoon even worse.

 Three weeks in a row, Chuck. That's three weeks in a row you guys have been late. I'm standing here with empty ATMs and a staff that I almost certainly have to pay overtime cause you are-what's the word? Late. That's just one example, Henry. The truth is, I can go on all day. Rocco, please, will you do me a favor and stop with the storytelling and maybe finish up rewiring

 or whatever's actually doing up there? Mr. Shelton, this is the exact point I was just making to Henry here. Everyone's so damn pissed off all the time. Look, Rocco, I have got mismatched money counts and a sour stomach, okay? Okay, all's I'm saying is we gotta be careful. Take heed. Tribal lines are being drawn everywhere. Hello, Mr. Shelton. Hey, Karen, how are you? You guys just about done? Oh, here's my figure, Mr. Shelton. And my figures. Oh, they match. Excellent.

All right, ladies and gentlemen, as you rightfully assumed, this is a bank robbery, okay? All I'm asking you is to sit still and breathe and be silent, okay? The last thing I wanna do is hurt anybody. I implore you not to stand up and dance, okay? 'Cause we don't wanna hurt you! All we want is the money. You can understand that, right? With inflation? That's all we want is the money. I wish you could understand that. Didn't I tell you not to move? Don't move! Keep your hands down! Keep your hands down. That's it, that's it, everybody. Dont' move! Dont' move! All right, just follow these simple instructions and we can all walk out of here safe and sound. You got that? Okay. Now, Abe Shelton, please reveal yourself. Abe Shelton. Come on, Abe.

Thank you, people, for your time and your cooperation. Let's never do this again, okay? Come on, fellas. Walk away. Walk away. Go go go, move! Gun! Take cover! Stay back! Come on, go!

All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but this is now a hostage situation. Now, I need you to follow orders. And I promise you bad things won't happen to you. I can guarantee that. Now, Mr. Piggy's gonna secure you into the center of the room. Please follow. You got that? Go ahead, move! Everybody move! Move! You! Up, over there! Go! Go! Ladies, up! Move!

Let's go, let's go, let's go. Get your legs in. Get your legs in. Get down. Get down. Get your legs in. We're good, Mr. Wolf! How bad is it? It's okay. It went right through, but the lady, she's bad, man. You need to help her. Just help her. Just help her. Okay? Go help her. It's gonna be fine. All right? Yeah. How's she doing? Bullet went right through her airway. She's gonna need a trache. And I'll tourniquet that leg if she makes it. Oh, Sarge, I'm gonna need a pen off that desk over there. Hold her. Support her head. Good work, man. Nothing to it. How's she doing? You don't have to worry anymore. She's stable. Yeah, but she needs a hospital ASAP. Rabbit, did you secure the back? The best I could, Mr. Wolf. What happens now? I can hear you through the goddamn walls, Aug. It's incredible. You sound like a trumpet filled with mucus. There you go, John Boy. You guys need backup clips, remember. I never heard of adult-onset snoring before, man. Hey, Hawke, you're short a concussion grenade. My father snored, his father snored, I snore. I'm just a late bloomer. What about those little presents you leave us in the bathtub, Hawke, huh? You're shedding like a yeti in the Sahara. I have a spare concussion. Take mine. Tool up! He's right, Hawkeye. It's like we're living with a wookie. Maybe you should start wearing a hairnet, man. It's only right. All right, put your domestic problems aside, SWAT-ties, and saddle up. Let's go. All right, here's the skinny. We got multiple HTs inside. Hostage count unknown. I need these perimeter streets cleared and these buildings evac-ed. They got clear lines of sight and low ballistic winds. I didn't know sniping required personal grooming tools, Q. Well, Connie, this here looks like the big one. And I'm the face of the squad. This here's like ancient Rome, and I'm the black Maximus. So I got to look good. Blaximus. Gluteus Maximus. All right, enough! Enough! Where's my skinny freak Tonray? Hey, I'm here. Yes, I'm here-hi. Here. Hey, Hawke. Go to hell, Tonray. Calm your nerves, Tonray. Christ, you're making me nervous. All right, look, I need complete communication breakdown, Tonray. Scare 'em into submission. Nothing but the TV. I only want them to see our army, all right? Uh, where's our advanced op gonna be, Lou? We'll figure it out when Cap gets here. How about that donut shop, Lieutenant? Or is that too cliched? Please. Excuse me. Please don't put our operations base in a donut shop. I'm the anti-donut cop these days, Cap. Why is that? Margie's got me on some Madonna-inspired microbiotic malnutrition diet. And I gotta keep up or the sex stops. I'd swap a titty for a tater tot right about now. Well, at least you're getting some. Damn, how long has it been? About a month. She's not even due for another five. Can you believe that? I can talk a hungry fat man out of a candy shop, but I can't even talk my way into my wife's panties. Send her some flowers. Shit always works for me. It's gotta work better than sending her chocolates. We got schematics on the bank and all surrounding buildings? Yes, schematics are en route as we speak. And Captain Cali, I just wanna say how nice it is to be working with you again. It's just a pleasure to be here to assist and support in all ways possible. What is his name again? Tonray. Tonray, I need two things from you. Kissing my ass is not one of them. First of all, follow instructions. Second, when you speak to me, speak proper English. Don't sweat it, Tonray. I started a sentence with "But" the other day, and didn't hear the end of it. Rightfully so. One misplaced word can cost lives in what we do. Remember that. How about that place? You up to speed on all of this? For the most part. Multiple perps, bank robbery gone bad. Holed up tightly. And... I assume you are Marcos. A pleasure to meet you. We're gonna be taking over your place. Hey, people, we need to stop being scared and figure out what we're gonna do here. B- be quiet. They told us not to talk. So? I'm not gonna blindly listen to what they say. Screw that. Come on. Abe's right. Let's just sit here. That picky bastard's just looking for an excuse to bust someone up again. Henry? Henry, you okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. Hey, man, you okay? Yeah, I'm all right now. I'm just saying, we can't do nothing. I got a kid here, all right? You're scaring him with this talk. Hey, hold on. I agree with the girl. Who knows what these guys are capable of? We need to be thinking of ways of saving our own asses. Do whatever you wanna do, just keep us out of it. What about her? She's in shock or something. All right, just listen to me, okay? At some point they're gonna kill one of us to show cops that they're for real, all right? And I'm not waiting for anything like that to happen. Hey. Hey, hey! I hear one more thing, I'm gonna come over there and start tearing things up! No talking! Man. What the hell did we get ourselves into? We're screwed. Yeah, well, I thought we'd be counting our cut right about now, hmm? Not holed up with hostages. But that's the way the shit shook down. So we're gonna do what we do best. We're gonna deal with it. You kidding me? Come on, man. We shot cops, all right? All right, we had a deal. No one gets hurt. All right, just calm down. No, look, I just wanna go home. I know, man, I know. But we gotta keep control of the situation, okay? We're in this here now. And we're in this thing together, okay? Unless any one of you doesn't wanna play this through. Just let me know, man. We've been through hell and back together, but if you wanna step outside and call it a day, just let me know. Come outside. You know us better than that. You saved my life. Our lives. You think I'm gonna walk out of here without you? I don't got anybody else but you. I know I speak for my brother when I say we stay with you. We stay in the trenches with you. Hell, yeah, he speaks for me, Sarge. I'm with you too, Sarge. Yeah, I know, man. I know. But no matter how hard we try to keep it clean, it might get nasty. Are you with that? Yeah, if you're here, I'm here. Right on-I'll buck with you. I'll buck with all you guys till the end. All right, then. I've sacrificed too much to spend any time behind bars. I'm riding with my brothers. Backing down is not in my blood. All right, man, I saw we all the way together, no matter what it takes. Big guns are on the scene. All right, this is it, fellas. We gotta secure the perimeter before they do. Cat, Mouse, hit the back room. Seal all doorways in case of a smokeout. I'm gonna set up and look for coordinate fire lines. Mr. Pig, Mr. Rabbit, you're on hostage guard. Collect all computers and phones. We gotta burrow in deep or we're done. Go go go go! On your feets You heard him. Come on, get up, get up! Come on, phones, wallets. Pagers, anything. You have anything? Go to the back of the line. You, get your belt off. What else you got? You got a phone? Huh? Anything else? Anything else? All right, here we go. We're ready. Captain, we're good. It's ringing. Who is this? Captain Horst Cali. And you are? I'm Wolf. Mr. Wolf. Nice to meet you, Mr. Wolf. My people tell me you're holed up pretty tightly in there. Blocked every exit, every vent. Impressive. How is everyone? Anyone injured? Yeah, we got one. But she's stabilized. What about you? How you doing? How am I? Just great. This is one goddamn party for me. Yeah, really? I like parties myself, Mr. Wolf. However, I can't say the same for the 50 or so SWAT team members surrounding the bank right now. So what do you say you and I work together to prevent them from crashing the festivities? Hey, let's just put this on pause, okay? 'Cause if you think you're gonna be my friend, or my priest, or my analyst who understands me or gets to know me so you can talk me down, this is all you need to understand, okay? I'm the guy with the hostages. I'm the guy with the gun. I don't want your advice, I don't want your friendship, I don't want any of that shit, okay? We're business associates. Traders trading commodities. So don't make it personal. You know, I appreciate your candor, Mr. Wolf. So tell me, what exactly do you want from me in our newly established business venture? What do you think I want? I want my freedom, that's what I want. That's a tall order. I don't think I can deliver. Why not? I think it can be really simple. You just got to focus on what's more important for you, huh? Jail time for us or the lives of these people? Okay, Mr. Wolf. We're businessmen, remember? There's no need to make threats. No threat to you, man. You're just over there in your little cozy operations base. I was referring to the hostages. As your new business associate, Mr. Wolf, it's only fair that I tell you that the hostages are your only commodity. The less you have, the less trading we can do. It's bad business. Yeah, thanks for the advice. You know, but sometimes you have to sacrifice your main resources to be taken seriously. You're being taken very seriously, Mr. Wolf. Now, what do you say we kick off our new venture with a transaction? We'll call it an introductory endeavor of good faith. Start with food, drink? And what's the cost? One. What do you say we get that injured hostage out of there? All right, deal. Good. Just one thing. My men and I, we've killed before. We know how to do this. We made a pact. We're not gonna go to jail, no matter what. You got that? This thing either ends with us free or dead. Formidable? Oh, if he's improvising, he's damn good at it. He thinks fast, as if he's been in siege situations before. Seems logical, though. I can use that. So he is for real? Yeah, unfortunately, I believe everything Mr. Wolf just said. So? Let's make the trade. Then we let them sit and sweat. Yeah. Watch out. Here we come! Move out. Here we go, boss. Found these stashed in a room upstairs. Rabbit to the rescue. What do you got? Good work, fellas. Good work. You got two basements? Study these suckers, 'cause I don't know if we're gonna leave through the front or the back. Okay, go ahead. Agent Kerry Southwell, FBI. Son of a bitch, they shot a Federal agent. Good tourniquet on that leg. And that trache... that's battlefield style. What are you thinking? I'm saying, I ain't seen that since Afghanistan. You know, Wolf said things to me on the phone. He used terms. Stabilized, operations base. Military terms. Military terms, military trache. Said he and his men have killed before. Think we got soldiers in there? If we got soldiers in there, this thing could get very complicated. Yo, brass ball. Here we go. Deputy Chief Abrami. What brings you down here? I have to say, Cali, my new job title sounds even more satisfying coming off your lips. Well, I'm glad you like it. Though I think you got me confused. You see, Tonray, he runs the ass kissing department. You got a good one here. So what do you say we get me caught up? Don't look at him, Ashley. My old battered bladder won't last here. You should say something. W- what is she doing? I mean, that's making me very nervous. She's smart. She's angling that Pig. We should all be thinking the same way. Listen, I'm not suggesting that we do something crazy here. But I planted my gun in that flowerpot over there. What are you doing with a gun? I'm a criminal defense lawyer, Abe. Need I say more? Mr. Rabbit. Keep an eye on your brother, all right? He's having way too much fun. You know what, bring a TV over there. Keep him distracted, all right? Easy, easy, easy. All I'm saying is, obey the house rules. Label your food. Don't scratch your balls, then use the remote. Flush twice. Let me amend that. Us two, you three. Sometimes you leave, like, this sand at the bottom of the bowl. It's disgusting. So three, minimum. Okay, this thing's ready. Oh, smile at the birdie, ass lord. Connie... we got eyes inside. Hallway's clean. We can move in still through a vent and then move for cover. Stand by, Hawke. Too soon to make a move. We can make entry... we should move in right away. I need to talk to her alone. Take those two. You're gonna tell the families of the deceased hostages that we made a premature move and we're sorry? We're talking about a tactical action. Getting men inside the perimeter to get us eyes and ears. Well, I don't think Wolf is gonna interpret this move the same way. In fact, I'm pretty sure he'll be ready for it. 'Cause you have some idea these are combat-ready soldiers who would not leave a back hall open. That's right. Well, they have left it open, Captain. And I'm not gonna wait for them to close it again. People who wait often miss golden opportunities. You ever heard that? You're making a mistake. I've worked tactics before. You see a hole, punch through it. That's not what I meant. When you said people who wait often miss golden opportunities, you used a misplaced modifier. Confusing the message recipient, me, about whether I'll miss a golden opportunity if I wait frequently, or if I'll miss a golden opportunity the very first time I wait. I'll tell you what. You give me a grammar lesson, after I teach you how to save these hostages. It is too soon to make a move! Let me put the screws to these guys, for Christ sakes. I will get one hostage out at a time. Save a life at a time. I will dwindle his currency down to zero. It is my negotiation. Let me talk. It's my department. My rank supercedes your tactical site authority. Fine. I want it on record that this is not my call. Duly noted. Was that the proper English, professor, or should I have thrown in "asshole" in there somewhere? Get your men in position. Let's end this. You... You like all this danger, Ashley, don't you? Huh? I mean, you only live once, right? Can't get a second ticket. No. No, you're damn right you can't. You looking at that? You like my tattoo? Yeah, it's cool. You got any more tattoos? I got that one. That's cool. Yeah, that's my favorite one. I bet you have a tattoo somewhere. I got a couple little ones. Come on, I showed you mine. Show me yours. Sarge. Sarge. Come on, don't be shy. Come on, come on. What's going on? My friend Ashley was taken by one of your guys. I'm getting really embarrassed. No! Don't get embarrassed. My shy little self is gonna have to ask you to turn around for a sec. One more second, mister. He didn't touch me, we were... I know, sweetie. Don't worry about it. Just relax. Piggy, take her back. Take girly back. Take girly back over there, man. Take her to the other hostages. Get back on patrol. What is this bullshit? Come on, man. Make contact. I need to distract them. While our boys make entry. What can I do for you, Captain? Just checking in. It's been some time. Yeah, well, I'm just sorting through things. Trying to figure out what I need next. That's all. I hear a TV. Watching the show? Yep. Only show in town, right? We got built-in drama. Action. Who knows, you and I, maybe we could be stars after this. Yeah, well, too bad I hate reality shows. You walk out the door of that bank right now, we can cancel the show. Wolf? Breach comin'! Breach! Move it, move it! Delta, you lost surprise. Retreat! What the hell is going on? I need backup! Move in! Move! Come on! Rabbit, Mr. Pig, push 'em back! Move move move! Ah! Move move move! Grenade! Come on. Delta team, talk to me! Man down. Man down! Zing has been hit. Come on, buddy. Come on, stay with me, bro. Zing! Come on, Zing! Medic! God, damn it! Excuse me. Excuse me. This operation is all mine now. You let these pigs know they can't screw with us like that, Sarge. You know, I keep talking to you about this, right? You keep jerking around, you know that? If you'd been patrolling the back hall like you were supposed to, they would have made entry. That's all I'm telling you. Talk to me, Wolf. Nice distraction, Cap. All right, face to face outside right now. Gimme a vest. It's time to prepare, Johnny Boy. Focus and lock in. Ready your mind. Your eyes make a mark today... To put it quite simply, will we be making a kill? Lower your weapons and step back, all of you! Step back! What's up, Cap? Mr. Wolf. That's right. The breach wasn't my call. Yeah, sure. I was following orders. Yeah, well, following orders sometimes will cost lives. In fact, it just did. Your men took out one of our SWAT team members. T- that's why your army's looking at me like that. I'm a cop killer. I see you up there, snipes. I'm looking at you, SWAT. Uniforms. I know what you're thinking about me, man. I've been here before. I've had guns pointed at me many times. It's not new to me. I know the fear. Go ahead. You wanna shoot me? Go ahead, man, shoot me. Go ahead. Look, I'll give you an easy target, man. Come on. Go ahead, come on. Go ahead, shoot me. Like they did in Fallujah, man. Or no, you know what? How about here? How about here, like... Like that shrapnel blast in Baghdad? Go ahead, shoot me. Come on, go ahead. What are you waiting for? I love my country, man. I fought for my country and I will die for my country. You think I wanted to end up here? You think I wanted guns in my face again, man? No way! No freakin' way. But I came home to sickness and nightmares. Even when I close my eyes, you know what I see? I see the faces of the soldiers and civilians that I killed, that's what I see. I spoke to my captain. And he makes me talk to a shrink who doesn't know shit. And then the goddamn government smokes me out with their lies and away goes my pension. Away goes my medical. And if my wife gets sick, who's gonna pay for it, huh? Who's gonna pay? I paid! We pay! I served my country, man. I served- 15 years I gave. Who's gonna protect me? Who's gonna protect me, huh? Who? So I started this and look where I am, man. Look where I am. Back in the firing line. So maybe you should shoot me. Go ahead. Maybe you should shoot me. I'd rather die than go to jail, that's for damn sure. I- I didn't spill my blood for this country, for freedom, to have it taken away when I came home. I got some demands 'cause they took everything away from me, okay? I want antibiotics, 'cause I got injured in there. And I want a flak jacket for every soldier in Iraq! 'Cause our stupid-ass government doesn't think that they're necessary. And I want the son of every senator who voted yes for this war to sign up for active duty! You get me those things, and I'll leave here. I'll ask for a bus and a chopper, and I'll disappear. You got that? Don't ever breach again, okay? You know what's at stake, and I know how to play.
