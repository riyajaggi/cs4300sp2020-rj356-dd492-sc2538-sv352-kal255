 The Kill Point (2007): Season 1, Episode 2 - Who's Afraid of Mr. Wolf? Part 2 - full transcript 
 Pittssburgh real estate tycoon leans heavily, via political cronies, to make his brat-daughter's release top-priority, but Horst Cali refuses to 'appreciate' being owed a favor. So deputy chief Abrami plans to have Cali replaced, or at least suspended, by an FBI negotiator after the first apparent failure. Wolf actually agrees to release hostages on humanitarian grounds for favors, but refuses to include the youngest, computer whiz kid Robby Sabian, and threatens to execute someone unless electrical power, which Horst ordered cut as pressure, is restored within the hour. Giving in to save a life is considered unforgivable control abandon, Abrami's ideal excuse.

 Tonray, looks like we're gonna be here for a while, so I need a few things from you. We got wolf's face now, so get in touch with the military. See if we can ID him. Connie! Connie, what are you doing with the donuts? Connie, don't even think about eating one of those. Don't throw away the goddamn donuts. This is bullshit. I saw action, and I ain't robbing banks.

 Goddamn martyr's turning this into a political cause. It was a good play, Connie. Yeah. Stockholm syndrome. People can empathize with soldiers. Hey, he's just buying time to plan his next move. We have to come up with our own. It has been confirmed to news 14 that after much speculation, Alan Beck is indeed at the scene. Now, we do have a crew standing by with his location. And we are expecting to go live from there in the next few minutes.

 Excuse me, sir? As we can see, Pittsburgh real estate magnate Alan Beck is indeed at the scene. And we're awaiting confirmation that his daughter Ashley is indeed one of the hostages. Now, born and raised right here in Pittsburgh, Ashley's been the center of much media attention throughout her childhood. But especially this past year... Oh, shit, here we go. ...as her college life has become more a point of interest. She just became our most valuable commodity. ...attending carnegie mellon, where she is in her junior year. Hey, mouse, turn the TV off. News 14 has heard some speculation that Ashley... Cat, piggy, you're gonna be on foot patrol. Go check out schematics. All right, get to it, fellas, come on. Thanks, boss. What's going on? I haven't seen you talk to anybody. Let's get that blood off of you for starters, huh? Just a little wet, okay? That's all. There we go. Nice. You clean up well. Look at that. You know, it looks like I'm in control here, but actually I'm just... Just trying not to let bad things... I'm just sorry you saw what you saw. Thank you. There's no way. We stay in here. Here it is, captain. All right, what do we got? Name, Jake Mendez. Three tours in Iraq. Ran his own platoon, the 1013. Spent a lot of time in fallujah. Patrolled Baghdad and Babylon. Couple of killer "b"s, captain. Wife died last year. 16-year-old son. Wait. Look at this. Christ. This needs to be read as soon as possible. Tonray, print out multiple copies. Get it to our friends in the press. Connie, track down his platoon-mates. Some of them may be inside with him. Who is this guy, really? That's what I hope to find out. Tonray, find out if the owner, Marco, has a partner named Marco. Okay, um, but... How do you want me to prioritize that? Is that important or not? Is that important or not? Tonray, there are so many things wrong with the construction of that sentence, I can't even stand to look at you right now. Okay, please, just go get it done, now? Thank you. Update on special agent southwell. She's out of surgery, in critical condition. The FBI is sending a team down to assist us. And someone is on their way to see you. That'll have to wait. It's not a request, it's an order. By one of the man's closest friends. The mayor. Alan Beck is coming. My daughter is inside the bank. So the speculation can now stop. I know this from a message she left for me shortly after the siege began. With that said, we're all aware that there are other hostages inside. I would hope that the media would respect that fact and not make this situation all about Ashley. Talk to the man. Buy us time. Words cannot express what my daughter means to me. Thank you very much. That's how he used to say good-night to me when I was little. Grabbed my nose, saying that he stole it. I wonder if they let the rest of our families know yet. My husband probably figured it out by now. Your families too. You have a husband. Robby. Rabbit, come here. We gotta find an alternate exit, all right? It's gonna take some time, so we're gonna roll into combat schedule. Strict patrols, rest on rotation. Just, we gotta manage the fatigue, all right? All right, whose laptop is this? Huh? Come on, people. Whose laptop is this? Come on, people. Talk to me. Whose laptop is this? It's mine. Mine. What's your name, junior? It's robby. I'm his father. I think it best if you just spoke to me. All right, you know how to work these? All right, you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna separate you guys into two groups, okay? Robby rob and his dad, Ashley Beck and her little friends into one group. And everybody else is in the other group. Just push 'em to the other side of the bank. Okay, come on, everybody up! Whoa whoa whoa whoa. You and you. You two. You, you, you. The skinnies and the fatties. Get close to me. The rest of you follow me. Why are you separating us like this? You ask another question, and I will shatter every bone in your face. That goes for everybody. Come on, let's go. Hey, cap, what can I do for you? I just wanted to let you know that the military released your dossier, sergeant. Oh, yeah? I hope you like fiction. Actually, I do not. So why don't you tell me what really happened? You got my antibiotics? Do you have my hostage? Yep. Okay. Then the medicine's on the way. What about my other demands, huh? I'm not getting out of here until they're met. Now, Mr. wolf, you and I both know those are gonna take some time. Q, radio in sight. Ht coming to the door. All right, come on. Say your good-byes. Get up, get up. Come on, come on. You're going home. Come on. If you are just joining us, we are here in market square. There has been a bank robbery at three rivers trust. The details are sketchy, but we do know there is an unknown number of hostages inside. Those details will become available to us and of course we'll bring them to you. Keep it here to news 14 for more details. Bernard kuzmicki, an older gay man. He's been a customer of mine for 15 years. Addie's been giving us hostage and ht positions. Firepower. And that the hts know Ashley Beck is inside. Anything about wolf? That he's clearly in charge. Calm. She says they're a tight unit. A well-oiled machine. Continue with the hostages, Addie. Okay, Theodore sabian. Kind of a happy fat man. And his son robby. How old would you say the boy is, Addie? 15,16. So he's the youngest hostage? Oh, definitely. Yes, I could say that for sure. Excuse us, Ms. berman. Excuse me one second. Get the boy out of harm's way. Absolutely. Why'd they break us up like this, huh? They cut off all our communications. No emails, no calls out, no nothing. But there's a bunch of other frequencies out there. If we can get this kid to get us onto an open, unblocked one... Money. Okay, that's it. What? You'll have to get word to this person. See, that's the new frequency that I just tapped into. And then you can communicate with them. How the hell do you know all this stuff, man? I actually kind of taught myself, so that I could listen to people's cell phone conversations. And then get them in trouble if they pissed me off. You're a crazy kid, man. Don't tell them-only speak when spoken to... I can handle myself... You know what, dad, I am sick and tired of... Hey, guys! Guys, guys. Save the dysfunctional bullshit for the dinner table, all right? It's not appropriate for a hostage siege, please. Sarge, a minute? What's going on? All respect due, but why haven't you asked them for a chopper or a bus? Come on, man. Come on, bro. That never works, man. People don't just drive off to their freedom. Doesn't work like that. We're gonna be so easily tracked. Come on, man, if we wanna get out of here, we have to come up with something that they won't see coming. You're on TV, Mr. wolf. It has been confirmed that Jake Mendez is a military criminal. Court martialed for the deaths of 16 fellow soldiers. The details are still sketchy at this time, but what we can tell you is that he was sentenced to one year in leavenworth following a plea bargain. He was stripped of his pension and his military benefits. Attempts are being made to contact other members of Mendez's platoon. In hopes that they too can add to the details of what actually occurred over there. How did 16 men lose their lives during this time of service? You did it, cap. You made sure I didn't become a martyr. Let's forget about that for a moment, shall we? I wanna ask you for a favor, Mr. wolf. We debriefed the hostage, she told us there's a boy inside. What do you say you send him out? I'd love to, cap, but I can't. Why is that? Because I really like the kid, that's why. You have a son, Mr. wolf. I think you can appreciate my request. Let's get the boy out of harm's way. It's not gonna happen, cap. I'll tell you what, you do me a favor, I'll do you a favor. You want steak and lobster for dinner? You want direct TV? I'm not interested, cap. Forget it. I want you to release the boy. Wanting's a lot better than having sometimes. Conversation over. Mr... Kill the electric, now! Nobody move! Hey, robby, did you link the BlackBerry? Why not listen, if we lose the power, we're gonna lose the clear frequency. And if we lose the clear frequency, then you will not be able to contact anyone. Come on, man. Are you trying hard enough? I am trying the best that I can. Come on, don't slack on me, buddy-boy. Come on. If I get the electricity back, you can tap into that frequency? Man, did you see how complicated that was, sarge? No. No, we need the kid. I need the electricity back. You know the price. Look, I'll give you anybody else except the boy. Anybody. You get power back, when you release robby sabian. Look, just take somebody else for the electricity, all right? I want the boy out of danger. Come on, save a life and take somebody else. Give me the child, Mr. wolf. I'll give you exactly one hour to give me electricity back or I kill a hostage, you got that? What happened to the lights? Shh, I don't know. Just go. I need a sliver of light. This is insane. There's no sliver. It's gone. Just go or I'm gonna pee in my pants. I haven't pinched the head of my prick to stop the flow of piss since I'm seven. We have to do this, Renee. Stay put, stay quiet. We go out there, they might kill us. I don't know you and I'm gonna pee in front of you? Just do it and get it in the vent. Don't get it on my shoes or my socks. I hate wet socks. Okay, fine, fine. I gotta focus, all right? All right, all right, all right. Oh, my God! Are you hard? Sorry, it's a reflex. You're down there and you're bumped against me. Are you going? Shut up! Addie just ID'd the hts from their military file. All from wolf's platoon. Wolf, we know him. Brothers Albert and Henry Roman. Both had records from before they went into the military. Assault, burglary, drunk and disorderly. And yet Henry is a decorated soldier. Did three tours. Didn't have to. Another war hero. Great. You really think they're gonna execute a hostage? Just to get their lights back? I don't know. I don't know what he's capable of. That's what I have to figure out. Cali, don't tell me you're thinking of giving in to wolf. I'm thinking about what I always think about, sir. Saving lives. You know the policy. We do not give in to death threats. You said it yourself, I know the policy. Good, don't make a move without consulting me. Yes, sir. Cap. If wolf is really gonna kill a hostage, don't you think we should just give him the electricity back? Get another one out? Tonray, if I give in, then I give him the power. I cannot afford to give him the power if it's only a bluff. Otherwise, we'll be here for days. Now, let me ask you a question. Have you spoken to Marco yet? No. Would you go take care of that, please? Thank you, good-BYe. Why, Connie? Why would wolf go balls to the wall for the kid? My guess is he thinks we won't breach if he has a child inside. That'Soo easy. Well, I have no idea. I understand. Look... Let's get some intel on robby sabian. Just in case it's something else. Yeah. Deputy chief. Beck's arrived. Christ, sarge, did you really say that? I got no choice, man. You said we weren't gonna kill anyone. Right, but we need electricity. Sarge, do u think you really put one of these people down? I'm not going back to jail, man. Neither are you guys, okay? It'd be our end. This is a numbers game. It's just our five lives or one of theirs. That's all. Do you think they'd really call your bluff and not turn the electricity on? Yeah, if it feels like it's an empty threat, yeah. But I'll do my damnedest to make sure he feels it's full. All right, any more questions? It's like survivor. Someone's getting run off today. Do you think they'd really kill one of us? I don't think so. It's probably just a bluff. Don't pretend you know them, all right? I'm not. They've been pretty cool to me, dad. Yeah, they've been pretty cool to you because they need you, okay? These are not cool guys, robby. These are bank robbers. Real observant of you, dad. Thanks for pointing that out. Cut the tone. I will not stand for. Hey. I won't! Hey, listen. We have to get word to the other group, okay? They couldn't hear wolf. And it's less than an hour till time's up. They should know. What are you doing? Excuse me? How about a bathroom break? What is it? Leroy, what does it say? Captain cali, thank you for seeing me. I'll get right to the point. My daughter's a little bit like me. She's not gonna wait to be rescued. My fear is that she may try something that will get her or someone else inside there injured. Mm-hmm. I would appreciate it if you would get her out before she does something stupid. Removing Ashley from that bank will benefit everyone inside. I understand. I'll do my best to get everyone out safely. Thank you. Appreciation is an interesting thing, captain. Many people would say it's a very good thing to be on the receiving end of my appreciation. Now, can we talk or not? I thought we were. Talk like gentlemen. Why don't we cut the cipher-like jargon? Everybody in that bank is of equal value. Not every life is of equal value, captain. It's naive of you to think so. I went through the rest of woif's military file. The incident that caused his court martial-- wolf disobeyed a direct order. Refusing to send his platoon into a hot zone. Another platoon was sent in, which resulted in casualties. That's not the crime I was expecting. Nope. He's got several instances of alcohol abuse and a long paper trail about his mental state. You speak to the men in his platoon? Can't find half of them. The ones I did speak to wouldn't say much. Let's try and taik the war hero down. Ready to turn my iights on and give me the power back? Not yet. I want to talk to you about reconsidering your demands. What do you wanna talk about? You wanna talk about killing? Is that what you talk about, huh? 'Cause, you know, I'm guessing you probably know diddly-squat about that shit. You'd be guessing wrong, Mr. woif. Oh, right, 'cause you've taken somebody's iife, right? I didn't take someone's iife. I defended my own. Yeah, weii, kiiiing's kiiiing, cap, especiaiiy from the corpse's point of view. What you're taiking about doing is not defense. You'd be killing without provocation, Mr. wolf. You're the one who's provoking me. Because you took something I need for survival, and I'm just defending that. You have no idea what my men and I have been through over there, and you have no idea what we're capable of, either. You're a soldier, sergeant. You're trained to protect American citizens, not kill them. Don't play that shit with me, okay? I'm beyond that. You know what I learned when I came home? I learned that life's one big, shit-eating war. That's what I learned. And in this war of attrition, I'm a soldier of misfortune Till the very end. You kill a hostage, negotiations are over. No, that's when negotiations begin, cap. Ciao. Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, sarge. Sarge, it's me. Shit, I gotta deal with friendly fire here, too? All right, look, we only have 22 minutes left. Which one, Mickey? Which one? What? Help me. How do I choose, man? How do I choose? Do I take the one with the life that's worth the least? The one with no potential? The one with no family? The oldest one? How do I choose, man? Help me. Let's go visit Connie. Look at wolf. Did you see him? Deciding which one of us it's gonna be. Maybe we should make a run for it. I'd rather go down making a break. No, we should stay put. I think we're gonna be okay. Oh, you do? Oh, well, that's fantastic. And it's really reassuring. My heart just stopped racing, and suddenly my stomach feels great. Just great. Hey, what about my gun? No. We make that move now, we're done. He's killed 16 people. You heard the television, right? The guy's a killer. He's a murderer. You keep taking this doom shit, I'm gonna knock you out cold. I gotta make it through this. I got little boys at home. But me, I don't have a family, do I? I'm just a sad, lonely 45-year-oid with no ties to anyone. My death will have repercussions for no one. Right? I mean, no one, of course, but me. God, I feel nauseous. It's the candle that's making you sick. I believe their candle's a soothing coconut ginger honey. I would have preferred that was my death scent. It's not the candle. Christ, Bernard, death is staring us in the face. I'm trying to get my mind off of something that I have no control over, Mr. Shelton. Don't let your fear own you. Qu? ser?, ser?. We should breach, Connie. They are clearly about to execute somebody. This proves it. Hawke, you better calm down. Cap, you need to see this. Hawke found this by the hatch in the basement. The bathroom's right by that door. Have them dust it for fingerprints. You find out if Tonray's spoken to Marco? I vaguely remember when taking a long-held piss was tantamount to a goddamn orgasm. These stones are making a mess of my urethra. Captain Horst Cali. Fired his weapon seven times in three years before he went to New York. Did his negotiator training there. It's the best program in the country. There is one option here. We can see if the man just does the right thing. He has a no-casualty rate for 13 straight negotiations. We just find somebody comparable, that's all. I'm just not comfortable dealing with somebody who's not interested in listening to me, especially when my daughter's life is in the balance. I made the phone calls, alan. The FBI's putting through a unit for secondary position. They have something at stake here because their agent was shot. I'd be a lot more comfortable if they were involved. We were on the mend, Jim. She was giving me a second chance. If somebody takes that chance away from me... Get on the phone. Hey, sarge. Sarge. I want you to know that what needs to get done shortly, we don't have a problem doing it. We're not saying that you do, but me and Henry know our roles in this thing. We're the assassins. We do what it takes to get us out of here. If it comes down to zero hour, and he still hasn't given us electricity, we'll do the deed. You sure you're up to it? We're up to it. Yeah, what's up, cap? I'll be right there. Sounds like he's ready to compromise. Hope you're not wasting my time, cap. Came to give you some information about some of the hostages. Bernard Kuzmicki, he has a heart condition. Found that out from his sister Carol. Henry clement's father, he's out of surgery, recovering nicely. Leroy Barnes, his wife called, told us he has an ulcer. She also said his two little boys are very worried about him. She said not to worry. She told the boys Leroy's working late. All right, don't contact me again unless you're ready to give me back my power. You got that? And you got 12 minutes or bad and bloody things are gonna happen. What'd he say? Did he blink? Excuse me, excuse me. Captain! Captain, I finally got in touch with the warden at Leavenworth. Turns out wolf had a breakdown in prison. He suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Other than that, his prison file is pretty clean. What about Marco? Oh, yeah, Marco. He doesn't have a cousin Marco. Or a friend. He wants to know why you're asking. No, you wanna know why I'm asking. Get me a can of spray paint. No questions asked! - Spray paint? - Go! What the hell are you doing? We got eight minutes, cap. The clock is ticking, and he ain't showing no signs of breaking. Six minutes left. And wolf is eyeing me. Just my luck, right? This'll be the first lottery I ever win. Please be quiet over there. Calm down, Mr. Shelton. We're the bad group. They're pulling the people they're going to kill from this group. Forgive me, I've got to do this. Mr. rabbit, I need to speak to Mr. wolf now. Sit down! Please, I just need to speak to Mr. wolf. Mr. wolf! Please just let me talk, Mr. rabbit. Please. Please, I need to speak to-- oh! Jesus! Mr. wolf! Please, I think I should be the one who's spared here. I know things about the bank that could help you! Please, Mr. wolf! What's the problem, brother? Nothing! He's freaking out! - I got him. - Hey! Hey! Let me out! Please let me out! Please let me out! Help me! Leave him alone! I gotta get out of here! Down! Get down! No! Please! Down! Get down! Help me, please! Please! - That's enough, Mr. Shelton. - No, please. Calm down. Calm down. Don't kill me, Mr. wolf. Please don't kill me. Please-- you need me, Mr. wolf. - You need me. - I need you, I do. I need you to calm down. Are you calm? Do not move. - You need me. - Are you calm? You need me. Mr. wolf. I'm the logical choice. If it comes to it, choose me. Two minutes before the hour's up, cap. What's your play? One minute, cap. 45 seconds. What is your move? Excuse me, excuse me. Here Note the apostrophe at the end of Marcos'. After the s apostrophes are most commonly used to form possessive plurals of nouns. As was the intention with Marcos'. However, there is only one Marco. There's no uncle Marco, cousin Marco, or friend Marco. It's a singular. Therefore, the apostrophe... Should come before the goddamned s! As such. Mr. Bernard, you can stand up, Mr. Bernard. Mr. Bernard, please stand up. It's okay. It's okay, man. Go sit down. It's gonna be all right, man. Bernard... Where did you find the strength for that? I came out of the closet in '53, Mr. Shelton. One hostage. Now. That's right. A deal's a deal, man. He's got control now, cap. I saved another life. That's what counts. You. You, Mr. Sabian. What? I didn't do anything. I know. You're going home. I told you specifically not to make any moves without consulting me. You weren't here. I didn't have time to seek advice. Yeah? Well, guess what. The powers that be are now fully aware that you folded to a death threat. Convincing everyone this is going to drag out indefinitely. The commissioner wants a full report of your exchanges with wolf. Fine. Congratulations, Cali. You just shit ail over your own dinner. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying with my son. Mr. Sabian, I'm not trying to hurt you, man. But you gotta go. It's gotta be you. - I'm sorry, okay? - Why? Take anyone else, please. You need my son. - Dad. - You need him. I'm gonna tell! No, you're not gonna tell anybody! Mr. Sabian. Mr. Sabian! Robby! Movement. Someone's coming out. I ask for a boy, I get a middies-aged fat man. Negotiator did not request Ashley's release. Why would wolf release you, Mr. Sabian? Why not your son? I have no idea. He was adamant about not releasing your boy. You have no idea why? I believe he thinks that... Holding Robby will keep you guys from storming the bank. I don't know. Excuse me. Finish debriefing Mr. Sabian. I'll see what this is about. Sir? Is this the FBI backup team? Special agent Kerry Southwell, she died a couple of hours ago. Brass is furious. They're bringing someone in from Washington who should be here shortly. As of now, you're secondary negotiator. - Secondary negotiator? - That's right. I just got another hostage out alive. Doesn't matter. Everyone inside that bank is now in more danger because of you. Why, because I disobeyed an order? You're not untouchable because of your high success rate. My perfect success rate. Please tell me this has nothing to do with Alan Beck's influence. Piss off the right people, politics prevail. I'm not a politician, I'm a negotiator. You're a secondary negotiator... In consultant capacity. Connie's team will remain primary, answering to the FBI. News 1 4 has learned that the FBI agent wounded during the shootout today at three rivers trust has died at mercy hospital. Two people dead at our hands now. How does this change things? Well, the FBI's gonna get involved. Just gonna have a lot less time than I thought. Mr. wolf? - It's ail set. - You did it. Everything's ready to go. The blackberry is on an unblocked frequency now. You just have to wait for the other guy to switch to the new frequency. And then you can talk to him. Right now, we can e-mail him if you want to. Good work, man. Good work. You gotta know that I had no choice about your dad, all right? You just gotta understand that for me. And also know that your dad begged me to send you out. Just remember that. You know that note you wrote for me? I didn't have to kill the old man because the cops believed I was gonna do it. Were you? Were you readily gonna kill him? I don't feel anything when I take a human life. Nothing. What kind of man doesn't feel anything? You tell me. Bernard Kuzmicki? Look, sir, if you feel any chest pains, you gotta tell me, okay? Talk to me, all right? And, Leroy, your ulcer starts acting up, man, speak up, bro. All right? Henry. I got good news for you, man. Your dad's out of surgery and he's feeling fine. He's great. All right? Anybody else got any aliments or problems, come to me. Got it? Hey, baby. I know. I'm sorry to wake you. I just-- I just wanted to hear your voice. How you feeing? Any kicking? No, no. I just wanted to say hi to both of you. Mr. Sabian. Mr. Sabian, I'm Alan Beck. Can you tell me how my daughter is? She's fine. They haven't hurt her. Thank you, Mr. Sabian. Now, what is it you need to tell me? Mr. wolf has a message for you. Your daughter gave Mr. wolf your e-mail address and your ceil number. And if you follow these instructions, Mr. wolf will get in touch with you. If you don't, and one of us goes to the police, then your daughter and my son will not make it out of the bank alive. What a handsome bunch of bastards. Platoon 1013, back in action. Thanks for coming so quick. Hey, sarge needs us. Let's get our boys home. Next on the kill point... I like watching you sleep. You say that to ail the girls? And if she stays in there too long, she's gonna try something. - This is agent Ashe with the FBI. - FBI. I think it's time we took matters into our own hands. Your job here is done. It's called psychological warfare. They spent winters in Faiiujah with bombs going off as they slept. Keep your eye on the door. We're coming out. All teams ready. Wolf's coming out of the bank. Sniper on the rooftop. Go! Go! I'm gonna put blood on your hands!
