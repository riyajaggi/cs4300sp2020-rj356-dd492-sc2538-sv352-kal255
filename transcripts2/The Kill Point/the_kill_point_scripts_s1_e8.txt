 The Kill Point (2007): Season 1, Episode 8 - The Devil's Zoo - full transcript 
 Captain Cali entered the bank for final negotiations, but calls the SWAT to move in. When they do, the hostages are found unhurt, the only corps is that of the Henry brother whom Wolf had to kill in a duel for leadership. Cali and the platoon have escaped in an ambulance and meet the unit's other team, but their leader, Deke, refuses to release Horst's wife as Wolf still feels honor-bound. Tonray discovers a bug, actually in Cali's shoe, so the police can surround them by surprise. A gun-fight ensues, from which only the smartest Henry brother escapes, who later cashes a fortune already wired to Canada. Wolf refuses to surrender and forces Horst to chase him and engage in a lethal gun-duel.

Now, take me to my wife. Breaking news from Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, where the bank siege turned hostage situation may finally be over. Moments ago, the s.W.A.T. Team entered the smoke-filled bank and rescued the hostages. However, we still have no information on the bank robbers. So it looks like there's a happy ending for the hostages and their families, but for the police, FBI, and other emergency crews that have been standing by, it seems that their day may've just begun. Stay tuned to news 14 for all the latest updates. We've checked every inch. There's no one in here. It's completely clean. How do I know, huh? How do I know you really have her? I need to speak to her, Wolf. Come on. Come on, Wolf, give me proof of life. Let me talk to her, goddamn it! I just want to talk to my dad. Okay, just please let me talk to my dad and let him know that I'm okay. We'll get you in touch with him. I-I-I just need to know that he's okay. Then they gagged us. And then they threw us in the vault. That's it. That's all I know. - What about Captain Cali? - We never even saw Captain Cali. At any time, did you see Captain Cali in the bank? - No. No. - No. I just told him. We never saw him. No one saw anything. I got nothing. I didn't, either. But we got roadblocks on all the major highways, cops and FBI on all the bridges, in the airports... Everywhere. I should've known something was up. Why would he help them? I don't know. But let's find him so he can tell us that himself. A city-wide search has begun for Jake Mendez and his band of criminals as sources confirm that the bank robbers turned hostage takers were never found at the scene. Pittsburgh police are asking citizens to call if they notice any suspicious activity, as suspects are still believed to be armed and dangerous. You may experience delays at bridges, highways, and airports, as police have set up roadblocks and increased security levels state-wide. Cover me! On your right. Hey! 331 7 team. We got officer hit. Hey, Deke, we're so close, man. Yeah, they set up roadblocks. Yeah, it's slowin' us down, man. What's your E.T.A.? Okay. Let me talk to my wife. - Hey, captain, it's not gonna happen. - Let me talk to my wife! - It's not gonna happen. - Why? It costs you nothing - to give me proof of life. - You got nothing to trade, Cap. I don't need to trade anything. It's proof of life! Just let me hear her voice! Put my son into the mix, you changed the rules. I didn't bring your son into anything. He came along willingly. Come on, Wolf, it costs you nothing! Just ask your friend to ask her the name of our unborn child. Could you do that, please? Deke, do me a favor. Just ask the wife the name of the baby. Michael. Come on, Cap. Don't worry, man. I gave you my word we're not gonna hurt her, we're not gonna hurt her. You hurt them, Wolf... ... I'll kill you. Uh, once you finish your statements, you're free to go. We'll be contacting you in the near future, but in the meanwhile, you're free to go home and get some rest. Some of your family are outside command. So that's it? We could just go? Yeah. You can go home now. It was a pleasure being a hostage with you fine folks. Time to bid you all adieu. Back to our boring lives, huh? You're my friend, Dave Shelton. You're my friend. Look. Look. There they are. Ashley! Oh! Oh! Bernard! Oh! So I guess I'll see you at work. Guess so. Bye, Tony. Bye, Renee. - Renee. - Honey! Son. You're all right. What do we do after we get out, bro? We stick together, or we gonna go our separate ways? I don't know, man. All I know is, I'm concentrating on gettin' out of the 'burg. I know that, man. I know that part. I mean after. I don't know. I guess we'll be on our own for a while. Life on the run. That's the only way I see it. Man, I haven't been on my own in a long time. A long time. He punched me, took me down. No gun to his back at the time? No. He seemed to be with them... Willingly. Okay, officer. Finish up with the medics. Stay close. I don't understand this at all. Lou. Chief. What? You know, I was wrong about you, Wolf. I was wrong. Captain! All this time, I thought you were a decent person, tryin' to hold onto your humanity. I don't know what they did to you over there, but...You're not human. You don't have any honor left. None. I don't know what they did to you over there, Wolf... But you have no honor left. You have no honor left. You hear me? What are you gonna do now, huh? You gonna put a bullet in my back, huh? What kind of soldier are you, Wolf? Shut him up, Sarge! You're a piece of shit. That's what you are. You're not a soldier who has any honor. You're a piece of shit. Just shut him up! Hey, Sarge, why don't we just dump him out right here? I mean, we don't need him anymore. Go make sure the place is clear. I don't see Deke, Sarge. He's comin', man, he's comin'. When are you guys gonna wake up and stop taking orders from him, huh? He get you in enough shit already? Go ahead. Go ahead. - I'll be right behind you. - What about you? - Your brother dying's not enough for you? - Keep talkin', pal. If you followed orders in Fallujah, Wolf, you could've let these men die like heroes instead of dying like a bunch of-- come on, man. You okay? You know, I won, Wolf. I won. I did what I said I was gonna do. I got every hostage out of that bank. What did you do? Huh? You get your people out alive? He get your people out alive? Did he? No, I didn't think so. That's some kind of leader you got here, boys. Yeah, he's some kind of hero. This your plan now? That's a great plan. You guys got a great chance of gettin' out of here with him. Pull over at Mckee's rocks and stand here out in the open so a chopper can fly overhead and just watch us? Huh? Hawke, we got a 20 on the H.T.S-- Mckee's rocks. Man up. You do reallize that every cop in the city knows I'm with you right now? You're not gettin' out of here, Wolf. You're not gettin' out. You can't drive. You try to take the west end bridge, they're gonna be waiting for you. You go down to the Allegheny docks and try to take a boat, they're gonna have the waterways covered. Sarge, you need to call Deke. We need to get out of here. You're not getting out. I am your only way out. Give me my wife back, Wolf, and I will help you get out of here. All right, let's do this. I got a present for you. Huh? My wife in that van? That's right. Hey, Deke! What's up? What a sight for sore eyes, baby. What's up, man? Oh, man, how are you doing? - You okay? - It's all good, baby. These are some boys I rode with on my first tour. Helped me bag the wife. Figured we might need some support in case you got shaky again. Forces have been depleted, Sarge. So, what are they here for, love or money? Come on. What do you think? I don't know. Let's just do this, man. Let's do this. Come on. You secured an out, right? Yeah, ready to go. Let's put it in the books. Bring her out. We'll just tie 'em up together. Right? Change of plan, Sarge. What does he mean, ''change of plan''? Get back. Change of plans? Small one. Yeah? A lot of people sacrificed themselves to set you free, Sarge, and there's a lot at stake here. You know? - All right. - Lot of money. I mean, there's $6 million waiting for us somewhere. You know, this needs to work, so, uh... So I need insurance. I mean, come on. Come on, man. What's better than having a cop's wife as our shield? Hey, Deke, Deke. Stick to the plan, all right, Deke? Come on. We're almost home free. Let's do this. No, Sarge, we're not. And look, I buck with you always, okay? But you gotta trust me here. - We need this woman-- - I trust you, man. I trust you. I just don't trust them. Come on, Deke. Listen to the Sarge, man. Stop screwing around. You're wasting time. Deke, no hostages, man, okay? Transport now. Let's move on to that. I hate to disappoint you, Sarge, but I'm gonna have to disobey that order. I got no life to go back to anymore. This needs to work. I need to get to that money now. - Who is this guy? This is not Deke. - It's me. Should be you guys, too. Come on, no big deal. Let's just take the woman and get out of here. I mean... Why do you give a shit? - It's unnecessary, Corporal. - It is necessary. I'm gonna give you a direct order-- I think it is necessary... ...a direct order to release the woman right now! ...and after everything I've done, I think you should respect that! Marshall, come on. You're coming with me. Let's go. Albert, come on, man. You with me? Let's go. Deke, Deke, I appreciate what you did for us. I really do, but we roll with Sarge. We follow his lead. Why do you think we left you in the car, Deke? You're dopey. Man. You don't listen to orders. We don't cross the line, son. Hey, Deke, I love you like a brother, man. But I'm not gonna let you take her. Yeah, well, that ain't for you to say anymore, Jake. - Oh, it's not? - No, it's not, 'cause it ain't your op anymore. I'm saying this is the best play.

Yeah, I know how to play the game, too, Wolf. Do me a favor? If my son falls into the system, can you make sure he's treated fairly? Can you do that? I could do that. Good. Now, how about you doin' me a favor also? Put that weapon on the ground. Cap, I can't go back in. I just can't go back in, man. You know, I wish I had what you had. I wish I had a life worth fighting for like you do. You got a lot to fight for, Wolf. You got a son who loves you. Come on. Put the weapon down.
