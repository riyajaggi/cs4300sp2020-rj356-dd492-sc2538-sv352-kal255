 Find her. {\an1}ALARM RINGS We've got an intruder. Girl number three. You do your job, I'll do mine. You find me Zubeida Rashid. I'd rather be looking for Temple.

 Out of your comfort zone, I'd suggest. I was in the need of a drink. And I needed to tell you that someone is trying to kill you. Oh, that? Yes, in fact, they tried already, and failed. Oh, was that a gut punch? Think she did her best. I'll come to the point. You have my money. I want it back. You have Sawsan? Roped and tied and in a very secure place. You have my money? Prove to me that you have her. Let me speak to her. I'll take that as a yes. So, we have a deal. An exchange to arrange. My money...for your daughter's life. New phone? Perfect. Call me when you want to do business. Look forward to chatting. {\an1}DOOR SLAMS {\an1}DOOR SLAMS {\an1}HE GASPS {\an1}CLATTERING Hiya, Mr George Bush. Fuck out! Tell us where you want us to be, and when - we will be there. Thank you. You should know that I have read your file, your police file. They say that Tariq was identified as a threat to the regime by his aunt and uncle. Muhsin, that is not how it happened. Nidal, I know. I know this. It is a lie. But because it is written... I am sorry you have had to live with the burden. It was me, Muhsin. I spoke once... too loudly at my hairdresser's. And you know how he was making us all sick... Maha, there is no blame here. I knew as soon as I opened my mouth... Maha, you did nothing wrong. I am the traitor here. I gave everything to the regime, and...they took my boy. They denied my wife any kind of medical treatment. And still... ..I wore my uniform. Every memory is stained. I can trust only you with the safety of Mrouj. Only you. We leave tomorrow. God willing, I will bring Sawsan to meet you at the border. It is arranged. {\an1}CROWING {\an1}ENGINE STARTS {\an1}ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUTING {\an1}MUSIC BLARES Hey! Good morning. How are you feeling? She's good. I'm good. Are we leaving? We are. I brought you clothes, but we've got to be quick. You understand? Yes. {\an1}DOOR OPENS Er, you might want to change out of sight. I'll go wait in the hall. If anyone asks, we're just getting some air, nothing more. Good morning, Mrjouj. Sleep well? Yes. Er, you had your bloods taken today? Not yet. OK, well, I'll arrange it. Just as soon as you've had your breakfast. I'll, er, see you later. Yes. Is she a friend? My father is busy. She's kind enough to visit on his behalf. You're doing really well, Mrjouj. Let's keep it up. {\an1}HELICOPTER WHIRS OVERHEAD {\an1}ENGINE STARTS {\an1}HE SIGHS {\an1}SHE EXHALES {\an1}DISTANT BARKING {\an1}ENGINE STOPS {\an1}PHONE RINGS Good morning, everyone... {\an1}RINGING CONTINUES ..updates to the, er, security situation. The following areas.... Parodi. I'm outside Zubeida Rashid's house. Where? What address? Al-Jadriyah, 329, Street 21. A raid may be necessary. Premises are walled. She's not alone. OK, good. We're coming now. I'll be running. {\an1}HE SIGHS I'd almost given up. Second thoughts, doubts? Some. I want to be well... ..but I cannot stay here. We'll play it cool. Your uncle's waiting on the other side. {\an1}HELICOPTER WHIRS OVERHEAD FEMALE SOLDIER: All right, stay in line! Come along! Have your papers ready! This young lady was being treated at the hospital. She now wishes to leave. Has she got a pass of surrender? I... I don't know. She's Inspector Khafaji's daughter. She would still have a pass. Well, can you not just cancel it? She wishes to leave. Tell me your name again. Megan Ford. I work for Frank Temple. She goes, you sign. Sure. {\an1}GATES OPEN So, go. {\an1}GATES CLOSE FEMALE SOLDIER: Stay in line, sir! Stay in line! Mrjouj... I was beginning to worry. My car is not far from here. No more than 20 minutes out, sir. Omar. {\an1}GUN IS COCKED {\an1}HE SHOUTS Why here? I feel sick. Don't you fucking dare, Frank. You get your money and leave the rest to me. What about him on the roof? Big man, big target. All right, let's go. I believe this is yours. How do you want to do it? You bring her to me... ..I give you your dollars. Is he with you? I want him gone! He is not with me. I want him down or I will shoot him down! Then shoot him down! He is not with me. Anything untoward happens, your daughter's the first target, clear? Very clear. Let me see inside the bag. {\an1}UNZIPS BAG All of it? Less 500 or 600. Expenses. Cute. Toss it over. GUNS COCK Do not engage! Hold! I will kill you. Sawsan, come over here. Come behind and stay close. Get ready to ribbon the fucker! Don't do that. Please! Please, don't do anything you'll regret. All I want is my money and then I'm gone for good. The first plane out today. All I want is for you to pay for what you have done. Sawsan, in here. {\an1}RAGGED BREATHING Don't kill me. Don't! Don't kill me. {\an1}HE GROANS {\an1}GUNFIRE {\an1}FRANK SHOUTS Frank, get back here now! Move, Frank, move! {\an1}EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE CONTINUES {\an1}HE GROANS AND PANTS They have brought more men than you said. Five minutes is all we need. Right, leave it! To the left! What happens after five minutes? We are being saved by the Americans. Where are you? Almost there. Almost may not be good enough! Who the fuck is being shot at? Captain, we are under attack. Temple and Evans are here. They wish to kill Zubeida Rashid. {\an1}BEEPING Fuck! {\an1}RUMBLE OF HELICOPTER BLADES They are almost here. We cannot sit here and wait to be shot into pieces! We will sit here to stay alive. Do as I say for two minutes, girl! That is all. {\an1}GUNFIRE CONTINUES Cease fire! Give me your grenade. {\an1}HE PANTS {\an1}HE SIGHS {\an1}HE EXHALES DEEPLY {\an1}SNEEZING AND COUGHING {\an1}THEY CALL OUT IN TERROR {\an1}HELICOPTER BLADES HUM Go on. Everyone out - let's go! Come on, lads, let's go. {\an1}SCREAMING Omar! Omar! Omar! Sawsan! Omar! Aah! {\an1}HE SCOFFS You all fucking kneel! On the ground! Get down! Weapons down. Hands behind your head and do not move! Do not fucking blink! You too, Temple. We've done nothing wrong here. If he moves, you have my permission to shoot him dead. Nothing wrong. I am a coalition official, senior official on coalition business. Weapons down! Hands behind your head! We were fired upon and we returned fire. Rules of engagement dutifully observed, as God and all these good men are my witness. Confiscate all IDs and weapons. Hand tie. Rules of engagement observed, Captain. Khafaji? Inspector Khafaji? It's Parodi. Show yourself! {\an1}TYRES SQUEAL OK, secure the weapons. Stick them in the back of the van. My bag is on the back-seat. It's personal. Into the car, sir. Where's my bag? I want my bag found. Where is it? I want it found. Do you hear me? Loud and clear, sir. You lost a handbag. I want it found! I want it found. Oi! Oi! You! Hey! I want it found! Fuck! {\an1}TYRES SCREECH We should not have left him. What should we have done? Should we have waited to be arrested? We should have taken him with us. Omar gave his life for us to escape. Escape to where? We're going to meet Mrouj and we're going to Jordan. Together. It's not what I want. What is it you want? Iraq is my home. You want more of what you have seen today? Bloodshed? I want to fight. HE SIGHS Fight for who and for what? I will fight for Sanaa, Zahra, for Mrouj, Tariq and for Mama. That's because that is what Mama would want you to do for sure, huh? To pick up a gun and kill? You believe that? You went to the Green Zone. Why? To kill Temple? Yes. And if you had succeeded, would Iraq have benefitted from his death? He deserves to die. This is my fault. My responsibility, not Sawsan. Sawsan chose violence, not you. He deserves to die. "Let the Americans come," you said. "It will mean democracy," you said. And I believed it. If it is democracy you want, then that is what you must fight for. So stop the car and let me out. Democracy! Stop the fucking car! Let me out! Stop the car! {\an1}ENGINE IDLES {\an1}DOOR SLAMS {\an1}HE SIGHS {\an1}ENGINE STOPS Tariq. Your only son. Why did you let him be executed? You were a policeman. You remained a policeman. I could not prevent it. Did you even try? I could not prevent it. I begged. I offered money. I offered to banish him from the country. I...offered my life for his. I could not prevent it. I remained a policeman to avoid arrest because if I had resigned, that is what they would have done. I had a family to take care of. Protect. I asked to take his place, Sawsan. {\an1}HE SIGHS {\an1}CAR DOOR CLOSES Dust. A car. There. Is it them? Cars. {\an1}TENSE MUSIC They are behind us. The United States of America. OVER LOUDSPEAKER: Halt... {\an1}HELICOPTER WHIRS What do I do? I can't outrun them. We're almost there. Zubeida, you stop. {\an1}TYRES SCREECH {\an1}HELICOPTER WHIRS {\an1}INDISTINCT MILITARY RADIO Who's inside? Professor Zubeida Rashid is the driver. My daughter Sawsan is in the back-seat. Neither are insurgents. They can't tell you anything you don't already know. You have my word. You may have noticed a dead man at the house. That is Omar. An Iraqi, of course. Temple intended to kill us all. He had kidnapped Sawsan. Is that so? Yes, that is so. Kidnapped for what purpose? A ransom. He believed I had stolen the money he had earned from prostitution. And did you? Yes. To pay for medical treatment. Over the border? Yes. Do you still have it? No, Temple has it. No, Temple does not. I had given him the money in exchange for my daughter. I have my daughter. Have you checked their vehicles? I'll do that. Evans claims he was fired upon and returned fire. I did not shoot at them, not once. Will they be charged as criminals? Not without witnesses. And with witnesses? I doubt it. {\an1}HE SIGHS They'll maintain they were fired upon and, in all likelihood, be shipped home. Controversy avoided. Controversy? Are we to be arrested? These aren't the people we're looking for. Let's move out. Move out. Sir! I don't belong in Iraq. But if your country is going to stand a chance, I can't help believing that you do, Inspector. Good luck. {\an1}HE SIGHS {\an1}ENGINE STARTS Baba. Baba? You cannot force me to leave. You're right. I cannot prevent you from doing what you want to do. You're right to want freedom. Which is why I will leave. Speak out. For Tariq and Mama. Living outside of Iraq does not mean I'm no longer Iraqi. It does not mean that I cannot fight. I WILL make myself heard. For my sisters and family. Good. Perfect. {\an1}HE SIGHS Be brave. Speak up. And speak out. {\an1}HE SIGHS MROUJ: Sawsan. Sawsan. Sawsan... Sawsan. OK, flash is working. That's it. {\an1}CAR DOOR OPENS {\an1}CAR DOOR CLOSES
