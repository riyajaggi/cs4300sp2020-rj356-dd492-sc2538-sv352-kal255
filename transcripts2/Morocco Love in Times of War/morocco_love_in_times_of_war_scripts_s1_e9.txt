 Ensign Pedro Ballester never arrived at the hospital. What do you mean? Several soldiers saw an ensign leave with a unit of volunteers yesterday morning. Let's go, ensigns! To the blockhouse! That way, let's go! Who brought this man? You're going to get killed, damn it! Take him back with the wounded. -Alejandro Prada, nice to meet you. -Alejandro, this hospital is for soldiers. Let me stay, nurse. Just until my temperature goes down. She has a very high fever. -She has just vomited. -Is she infected?

 -We don't know yet. - Clean the wound well, Captain. Sir, there's no pulse. -What do you mean, there's no pulse? -I'm sorry. -How was he evacuated, sir? -On a mule, up to the spot where the ambulance could reach him. That's what killed him. We need to send more medical staff with adequate protection. -What are you thinking, Colonel? -A surgical team in the vanguard. We could save many lives. If they ask me to go, I will. Exactly like you would. This is his fault. -She's my friend. -No, she's not. You'll always be from different worlds. That won't change. I want to go to the field hospital.

 -You really want to go to the front line? -When do we leave? Only three nurses going and one has to be my fiancée. I wish you could have seen her working day and night as a nurse. She's not a nurse! Do you really want us to be together? -If something has changed, tell me now. -I have to go, do you understand? -Nurse. -Yes? Come here, please. This is my favorite. The most beautiful nurse in the hospital. No. No. You took care of my brother when he was in the guardroom. -That's my duty as a nurse. -No. My brother's alive because of you. Thank you. Lieutenant. We've got it! We've got it. It's ours. You're going to get better. Why did you have to turn up? We only have one life, Magdalena. Thank you. -Magdalena. -Daniel? Yes. No, no, no, Pedro! No! Pedro! Soldier! Get him to the operating room, stat! Julia, it's best if you wait outside. Scalpel. Now isn't the time for questions. There's no more time. Does he still have a pulse? -Yes. - They're relying on us, and we can't be scared. It's the moment of truth. Julia! Help me, please. A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES Are you okay, Verónica? Are you alright? -Fidel, he has no pulse. -Put pressure on it! -Put pressure on it, Guillermo! Help me! -He has no pulse! It’s over, he's gone! I'm so sorry, Verónica. Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! Julia! The rebels counterattacked using weapons left behind by our army in areas we had lost. There's a large number of casualties. After hours of intense combat, -we forced the enemy into retreating. -Is the phone line out there still down? Yes, sir, but we've received a heliogram with some bad news. Pedro Ballester is among the dead. -Did you say Pedro Ballester? -And a Red Cross nurse. What? -An injured nurse? -No, sir. Deceased. We don't have a name yet, -but they confirmed her death. -Find out. -Confirm who it is. Call them! -The line is down, Lieutenant. I need to know what's happened! -Sir, permission to go-- -Calm down, Lieutenant. They’re being evacuated. They'll be arriving soon. Sergeant, I need a vehicle to go to the field hospital. It's urgent. -The colonel must authorize-- -I've just ordered it personally. -Get the vehicle, now. -You may go, Sergeant. -Lieutenant, what are you doing? -I have to find them. -I have to know if my fiancée's alright. -Keep this up and I'll have you arrested. -I'm begging you, Captain. -You're dismissed. Did you not hear me? You're dismissed. Thank you, Colonel. Keep me informed. Have you heard anything more, madam? Yes, Pilar. The wounded are en route. We need to prepare the ward, I don't know how many there will be. -Aside from wounded, will there be-- -Yes, there will. Those who've fallen in battle will also be arriving. Pedro, Julia's brother, and... one of the lady nurses. we don't know if it's Julia or Matilde. Go. -Yes. -Go. -This room was the school library. -It smells like... -There's a strong smell, isn't there? -Really? Maybe, I've gotten used to it. We work all day in here and sometimes through the night. -Nurse, some water, please. -Excuse me. There you go. -Magdalena. -Pilar. Daniel? What-- -When did you get here? -Pilar! I didn't recognize you! Magdalena's mother received an urgent letter saying she was ill -and, well, here I am. -That's why you're here? Your mother was very worried and I want to speak to your doctor. This illness surely has a name, doesn't it? -Pilar, you don't know what it is either? -No, sorry. Excuse us. -I have some bad news. -What's wrong? The rebels attacked the field hospital. Julia's brother, Pedro, has died. A nurse died as well, but we don't know who. How terrible. That smell is blood, isn't it? I think I'm going to faint. -Daniel. -Daniel. -Sit down. -I'm fine, I'm okay. I'll bring sugar water. -Wait... -Relax, calm down. Daniel, listen to me. Didn't you receive a letter from me? I sent it a while ago. A letter for me? No. The postal service is inundated with the war and all. -What does it matter, anyway? I'm here. -Yeah. Seeing each other in person is much better than any letter, right? No! Miss Medina! Sorry, we weren't introduced earlier. Larbi Al Hamza. -Pardon me? -That's his name. Oh, really? Of course. -Daniel de Zumárraga. A pleasure. -Let's continue the tour. -What's an Arab doing here? -He works at the hospital. But he's a rebel and we're at war with them. Daniel, here's your water. The wounded have arrived! Larbi, help the orderlies. Ladies, with me! -Quickly! -I have to go, Daniel. -Let's go. -Yes. Sorry! I'm coming. Magdalena? You're okay! Can you walk? Luis, there's another ambulance on its way. Call the Docker and ask for the stand-in surgeon. Madam. -Madam. -Captain. One of the attacks took us by surprise and... one of the explosions caught Matilde. -Julia's brother, Pedro-- -I know. Someone take this soldier. Fidel! Thank God you're okay! I'm so sorry. Nurse. Nurse, please wait. I didn't know you were the ensign's sister. I want to give you my condolences. I don't know if what I have to say will help at all, but... your brother was a hero. Most of us are still here because of what he did, yourself included. Excuse my language, but he had balls, your brother. You should be very proud of him. I'm so sorry. Julia! Julia! How are you, Julia? I'm so sorry, my love. I'm sorry. I swear, I tried to come find you, but there was just no way. -He's gone. -I know. -He's gone. -I'm sorry. Come on! Let's go! Someone help! Verónica! -Come on! -Let's go, hurry! I was there, too, Verónica. We're all to blame. Stop tormenting yourself, please. If I hadn't left him, if I'd gone with him... You can't do this to yourself. We shouldn't have operated. -But, Verónica. -What? Would you stop following me, please?! Your brother died in the line of duty. As did Matilde. I'll have Matilde's body transported to Madrid immediately. Her parents will want her laid to rest in the family tomb. If you so wish, your brother can be placed on the same boat. But soldiers... are buried here, in Melilla. Yes. There are so many casualties that repatriation would be impossible. If you wish it so, Pedro can be the exception. My brother died a soldier. I think it would please him to be buried here... with his comrades. Nurse! Pilar! I need you here. I need to stop the bleeding. Bleeding was stopped on the battlefield. If not, he wouldn't have made it. Shrapnel removed moments after the event. He'll walk out of here tomorrow. Open fracture to his tibia, treated and immobilized on the battlefield, sir. That's enough, Captain. The operation was advantageous. -We did what we could. -I know. Colonel... General Ibarra is outside. Colonel, are you aware whose daughter the lady nurse who died at the front was? The Duke of Fuensanta's. General... I'm responsible for the deployment of the health care team and what happened thereafter. Therefore... with your permission, I request to be relieved of my duties as Head of Military Health Care in Melilla. -I'm sorry you have to pay the price. -With all due respect, General, the field hospital was organized and placed into action -under my orders. If anyone should-- -Captain! Nobody gave you permission to get involved. Don't worry, Márquez. He's just trying to help you. I'll process the paperwork. Thank you, Colonel. -Sir. -Captain... I may have some flaws, but I can recognize loyalty. I appreciate yours. It was my decision and I will face the consequences. -But, sir, the field hospital-- -The field hospital is a good idea. Do what you can to make it work. Somarriba. Magdalena... I'm going to drop my luggage off at Susana's house. I'll wait for you there. Will you be long? I need to get water. You're not well, you shouldn't exert yourself. -You should be resting. -I'll rest later. -Don't worry, Daniel. -Alright, then. -Why is he here? -Larbi! You scared me. -What did he say? -Nothing. I haven't said anything either, but you know me, I can't lie. He must have noticed something's off. -But you sent him a letter. -Well, he never got it. It must have gotten lost or it's still on the way. I don't know. You're going to have to tell him what's going on, then. I know that. It's just... it was easier by letter. -Don't worry, I'll talk to him. -No, what are you doing? I have to tell him I'm your boyfriend now. What? No. Well... boyfriend, as in... Don't worry, I'll take care of everything. Wait, Larbi. Please. I'm the one who has to speak with him. Would you like a sweet pastry? They're delicious, they have a sweet filling. Try them. -Alright. -Daniel, you have to get her out of here. She's ill and look what happened to poor Matilde. It could be Magdalena next. Don't listen to my mother. A bullet could just as easily come through that window. -Good evening. -Good evening. Hello, Vicente. Father, do you remember Daniel, the youngest of the Zumárragas? -Of course. Nice to meet you. -Thank you for your hospitality, Colonel. Would you mind if I have a moment alone with my family? I need to talk to them about something... very important. That's not necessary, Vicente. Daniel is like family. I've asked to be replaced as Chief of Health Care. Perhaps I should... I'll be in the bathroom, yes. What's happened, Vicente? -Does this mean we're leaving Melilla? -More than likely. They need to assign my replacement. It could take two months... or two days. But I'm getting married. To you, Pedro. To you, brother. May I? Sure. That won't help. It won't help you. My brother said you were fed up with him because you're too protective. Really? "Never let your gun out of your sight." "Never turn your back on the enemy." And of course, "Never tell a superior officer what you're really thinking." To you, brother. Do you know what he said about you? About me? Nothing because I was his perfect sister. "You're an idiot if you let her get away... Not because she's my sister, because she's one of a kind." If it weren't for him, we wouldn't be together. The first time we went out, he tricked me. I didn't know you were coming, I thought it'd just be the two of us. -Going for a stroll along the boulevard. -A stroll... If he'd told you I was going... -I doubt you'd have come. -No, probably not. I know, I know. This won't help. I think this is the first time since we've been here that it's just you and me. Your brother taught us all a lesson. Should that make me feel better? No, but it should serve as an example. He lost his life to this war. We have to honor him. During hard times we look to the things we really care about. Things are the way they are, Doctor. Don't complicate them. -You don't have to worry about me, madam. -I'd like to believe that. Now all I'll be to her is the doctor who couldn't save her brother's life. I made a promise... and I failed her. Hi. Are you okay? You've heard about my father, right? Yes. I don't want to go. I can’t leave here without you. I'm sorry, Susana. This is all my fault. I need to be with you. I need it. If not, I'll go mad. My mother's started packing, what can we do? Bring the wedding forward. Are you serious? What do we really need? You, me, the priest, and your parents. If you don't mind it being a simple ceremony. We can request accommodations in the officers' quarters. -If we speed the process up... -I'll take care of it. In two weeks we'll be married. Two weeks! Magdalena, are you alright? -Do you still have a fever? -No. I'm having hot flashes. I don't know why. Your fiancé is coming, have you spoken to him? Thank you. -Are you scared of him? -No, why would I be? When he comes, I'll tell him the truth. Problem solved. He'll understand. He has to. Would you mind giving the paper to that patient, please? Thank you, Larbi. -Good morning, my love. -Good morning. Are you alright? Come with me, we need to talk. Come in. What's going on, Magdalena? Lord, I've told Pilar a thousand times that these sheets don't go here. This isn't where they belong. Let's see... -I'll need to remind her-- -What's going on? You're worrying me. I'm sorry, Daniel. I just... don't know where to start. The thing is, in the letter I wrote to you, I told you that... That? That... That since I arrived here... I see things differently. I'm not the same person I was. You look the same to me. Well, I'm not. If you knew everything I've been through... Daniel... In the letter I told you... that I don't want to marry you. I know. I got your letter. I tore it up as soon as I read it. You had a bad day, wrote the letter, and sent it. I didn't show it to anyone, Magdalena. Nobody knows. Don't worry, the wedding's still on. But, Daniel... it can't be. Is there another man? Is that it? I get it. I get it. You must have felt lonely here, so far away from home. It's... understandable. Don't worry. If you've met someone else, you can tell me. I'll understand. Well... the truth is, I have. I've met someone else. I knew it! I was positive! I knew it before I read your letter, I had a feeling. -Please, Daniel... -How could you do this to me, Magdalena? I trusted you. At the station, you asked me to wait for you, remember? Daniel... Who is he? Nobody. I mean... he's not here anymore. He's gone. -A soldier? -Yes. A soldier, but he's not coming back. Why not? Is he dead? A little bit. No... I don't mean a little bit. I mean... It's over, you can forget about him. I understand you want to end our relationship, it's for the best. You don't trust me and I feel terrible for hurting you. So, my dear Daniel, let's just end things and part on good terms. Daniel... -Did you want me, madam? -Yes, I want to introduce you to someone. Alejandro Prada, reporter, this is Pilar, my head nurse and right-hand woman. It's an honor to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Have you indeed? -Charmed, I'm sure. -Mr. Prada wants to write a story about our work here in the hospital. He has a reference from the queen. It will be a tribute to the deceased lady nurse. -For "The Telegram." -I'm what's known as “freelance.” Do you know the term? Yes, as in you sell your services to anyone, right? I want you to show him the facilities, how we work, our resources, and anything else he wants to see. Shall we? So, Miss Soraluce, where shall we begin the tour? -Why did you pretend you don’t know me? -Why did you? -You started it. -You're glad to see me, admit it. I couldn't care less. Very glad, indeed. I saw how your eyes lit up when I turned around. I wonder, how did you survive all this time here without me? Please, I barely remembered you. Verónica was paralyzed. I've never seen her like that. One must talk about these things, get it all out. Pedro was very important to her, that's why she needs help. Sure, of course. [speaking in foreign language] -What are you saying? -It's my shopping list. -Why do you care? You're not listening. -Sorry, what did you say? This wound needs to be cleaned. That's right. Nurse Pilar, I need you in the operating room now. I can't, the duchess has tasked me with something. What did she task you with? This is urgent, Pilar. -Do you remember me, Doctor? -Yes, I remember you. Follow me to the operating room to prepare for surgery right now. Dr. San Esteban, bring the patient as soon as he's ready. And can someone please pick up that bucket, please? We'll finish up later, try not to bother anyone. We don't have all day, nurse. -Are the instruments sterilized? -Of course. -Do we have enough anesthetic? -Yes. What is that man doing back here? He's here to see you, isn't he? Pilar, haven’t you realized he's a scoundrel? You could be talking about him or yourself. It's glaringly obvious. He's a parasite and a crook. He won't stop until he's seduced you and then what? -Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am. -Why do you care? Well, I do care, very much. I don't want you to get hurt. Right, you prefer to do that yourself. I don't want to drive you into the arms of a bastard like him. You? -You're doing this to make me jealous. -I can't believe what I'm hearing. For your information, Alejandro is a renowned photographer and reporter. He's been sent by the queen to write an article about the ladies' work here. And by the way, my life stopped being about you a long time ago. Anything else, Doctor? Alejandro? You call him by his first name? Julia... I heard about your brother, I'm so sorry. Thank you. I don't have any siblings, I can't imagine what you're going through. Who knew this would happen? You never know what's coming. Especially during a war. Are you staying at the hospital? Or will you accompany your brother? No, he's being buried here. At Purisima Church in the war heroes' cemetery. What an honor. Julia, I'm here if you need anything, I truly mean it. Excuse me. If I may, Colonel. Everything is ready to board the lady nurse on the ship. I can take the coffin to the port, if you want. No, no, I'll be escorting it personally. It might be the last thing I do as Chief of Military Health Care. I'm heading over there now, I hate making anyone wait. The ship is leaving this afternoon, you have time. Take care of yourself, Somarriba. Keep your strength up, you're going to need it. They say taking Nador will be easy, but you know how it is. Health care never gets a day off. War is like an epidemic. Like an epidemic in and of itself. We'll miss you, Colonel. -Now I don't know if I want to stay on. -That would be a mistake, Somarriba. There's no better place to ease the suffering of others than right here. -You've done great work here, Colonel. -I tried. The truth is it's been my life's work. And now I want to ask you for a special favor, Somarriba. Stop trying to flatter me, will you? -I'm sure you have better things to do. -Yes, sir. Let's go. -Madame Duchess. -What are you doing here, Colonel? Orders from Madrid. I'm escorting the body of the Duke of Fuensanta's daughter. -You can come in my car if you wish. -I heard you've resigned. You don't resign from the military, madam. I've asked to be replaced, but I've yet to receive new orders. In my opinion, it's not the best time to leave Melilla. Don't pretend you're not thrilled that I'm leaving, madam. You might feel a bit of pity for the old man who failed in his duty, -but it won't last. -Stop being so dramatic, Colonel. We've had our disagreements, but I admire your tenacity. You may be a veteran, but you're not old. I don't know whether to thank you or never speak to you again. You need to stay in Melilla, Colonel. Now more than ever. The field hospital proved its worth, but the death of a lady nurse could put the entire operation at risk. We need your backing. -If you want me to pull some strings-- -Please don't go on, madam. I authorized the field hospital... -I sent unarmed civilians to the front. -And they saved a lot of lives. Madam... You don't have to do anything for me. What's more, I'm asking you not to. Please. "Dear Mother, my heart is broken from so much crying, but everyone says I should be proud... and you should, too, though we'll never see him again. Your son, my brother, the youngest of the house and everybody's favorite. Today's papers tell of the last deed of Ensign Pedro Ballester. -About how he gave his life for us... -Fire! ...and for that he'll go to heaven. Load! Pedro has been laid to rest in the war heroes' cemetery. Fire! His name will go down in history as part of this war. The last time we saw each other, he was leaving to take a ship far away from here, but it wasn't meant to be. He chose to give his life to save ours. Just as he always did. And as for us, Mother, the ones who will miss him the most, we don’t need him to be a hero. We're proud of him because he loved and was loved right until the end." Julia... I know nothing I can say will make you feel better, but... I'm sorry. I swear I did everything I could to save your brother, but... No one blames you, Captain. You did what you could. I'm sorry. The sofa won't work, but I'll take that sideboard and the mirror in your bedroom. No, the mirror was a gift from my mother, it goes where I go. I don’t even want to think about it all. What if they send us to a base in the Philippines? We lost the Philippines 20 years ago, Mother. -And with the rank you had here, Manuela. -That's the worst part. If they send us back to Madrid, all I'll be is a colonel's wife. As if there weren't enough of those there. That's if they don't send us to a place in the middle of nowhere. He'd be sent to the reserves soon anyway. -One way or another, you'd be leaving. -Keep your thoughts to yourself. Look at you, you're rushing the wedding. -Do you know what people will say? -They already are. -Can I take that table? -Already? What are they saying? Excuse me, madam. -There's a man asking for you, miss. -What man? Send him in. Excuse me, ladies. -Good morning. -Hello. You're the manager of the bar, right? Dámaso Fuentes at your service. I'm here on behalf of Daniel Zumárraga. Daniel? He's upstairs sleeping. I'm afraid not, miss. That's why I'm here. He came in yesterday and started drinking. I couldn't get him to leave. I left him to sleep it off and this morning he mentioned you. He said he didn't want your parents to see him in this state. Then he started to drink again. There he is. Thank you. Daniel? Daniel, please wake up. Hello, Susana. I'm so sorry. What time is it? I'd never have thought... No, you're mistaken. I don’t drink, I never have. I drank today, because... -I didn't have the nerve to kill myself. -What do you mean, kill yourself? Magdalena left me for another man. What? Would you like a shot? If that's too strong, I have anisette. Magdalena works all day and at times all night, she only visits on Sundays. And you've never seen her with anyone? With the other nurses and the patients, of course. With the odd doctor. Well, and there's the Arabs. I've told her off about it. She spends all day surrounded by them. What Arabs? The little boy who almost killed us all with meningitis. And the other one, his father or brother. He's tall... and not as ugly as the rest of them. -I think he's called Larbi. -Yes, I met him. Anyway, he's just a driver and helps the orderlies, I don't think... -Where are you going? -There's only one way to fix this. Thanks for your help. Do you know if Miss Magdalena Medina is inside? She is. You! This is all your fault! I'm sorry, I don't understand. -Can I get past? -No, you can't. You've ruined my life and now you're going to pay for it. I don’t think you’re familiar with the Marquess of Queensberry Rules, are you? I don't want to fight you, sir. You should have thought of that before. En garde! Please, just go. I have to work. Put your fists up. What’s wrong, are you scared? -Please, sir. -Why won't you fight? Dear God, Daniel. What are you doing? -I know everything, Magdalena. -Have you been drinking? I can't believe this. Come with me and get some air. No, let go. I would have expected anything but this. Not even in my worst nightmares. How could you and this... Arab?! Please calm down. You don't know what you're saying. Yes, I do! You've let yourself be seduced by an Arab! Could you get any lower? An Arab! What of it? Magdalena gets to decide what she wants. Not you or me or anyone else. Only she can do what she wants with her life. -Have you gone mad, Daniel? -Let me at him. I'm no coward! -Magdalena... -No, Larbi! No, please! You're making a spectacle of yourselves, just stop! -Take it easy. -That's enough! I said that's enough! -Magdalena. -Magdalena. Say something, Magdalena. Hey there. You're finally awake. I'm so sorry, my love. -You can't be up and about in your state. -You caused this by coming here to fight. -How dare you? It's your fault. -Can you keep it down? Move aside, I need to examine my patient. Am I sick again, Doctor? I don't think so. But you are very weak. You work too hard and if people upset you... -You need bed rest until tomorrow. -No, absolutely not, Doctor. There's a lot of work and I can't stay... -Magdale-- -Stop. You see? You need complete rest, do you understand? Complete rest. -I'll stay with her, Doctor. -No way. I'm her fiancé. Leave me alone. -But, Magdalena-- -Please. Both of you out. And don't fight. -Delicious. -You're not leaving that, are you? You've still got dessert. Do you like melon? It's nice and cold. I haven't eaten this well since the Infante's Holy Communion. You were at the Infante's communion? Tell me about it. I'll tell you whatever you like, Madame Raquel, but I want some information in return. Me? What could I possibly tell you? -You know everyone. -Don't be so sure of that. I work here from dawn until dusk, so I don't catch news of much, really. -Try me anyway, you might get lucky. -Do you know Pilar Soraluce? The duchess' right-hand woman, the brunette. -The beautiful one. -Don't exaggerate, she's not beautiful. -What do you want to know? -Everything. -You’re really interested in that brat? -You have no idea. Well, I'll tell you something. You couldn't have come at a better time. She needs a man and she needs him ASAP. Where should I start? From when she was left at the altar? -Good morning, Estrella. -Sorry, Pilar, after you. I'm sorry for being an idiot. -Sorry won't stop you from doing it again. -No. -I won’t do it again. I promise. -Miss Soraluce. Can you come for a moment, please? What is it? Pilar, you have to come with me. It's a matter of life and death. -What is it? -Someone urgently needs your help. I can't say anymore. We're at war and the walls have ears. -I'll have an ambulance sent. -No, no. A nurse will be enough, it's... delicate. After you. We're here. -Where is the patient? -Wait a moment. Would you like a drink? You have no shame. None whatsoever. -It's champagne. -I'm not going to drink it. It isn't for you. For you, I have something else. -Don't touch me. -Over here, nurse. You know how to dance, right? A woman as beautiful as you must dance beautifully. -Are you going to dance? -Of course not. Damn. Pilar... I know how you feel. I've seen a lot of men die on the front, too. This war is horrendous. And we don't know how long this suffering will last. But what should we do until then? Don't we deserve even a little bit of fun? You can put the music back on. May I have this dance, miss? Sir. -You stepped on my foot. -No. -It was you. -Me? It wasn't me. I'm a professional. Sure. I can't believe this is Melilla. How did you find this place? -I'm a great explorer. -Of course. What else? I'm a writer, a philosopher, a reporter, magician... A bit of a con man, the captain of a ship, greyhound breeder, but above all else, an explorer. -And what do you explore? -Everything. Right now, Melilla, the Rif, this war... but tomorrow, who knows? China, next month Patagonia. The world is a huge place, Pilar... and it's waiting out there. Are you coming? I wish. What's stopping you? -You're a free woman. -How do you know? I know you were left at the altar. I also know you remarried -and that you were widowed. -Who told you that? -Take me back to the hospital. -I don’t want to. -I want to take you to China or Japan. -Enough! I said I want to go. That way, you can finish your damned article. I already did. Hot off the press. -Do you want to see? -No, I want to go. Fine. Okay, we'll go. Just read it, please. Please. "Angels over the Rif. Thirty thousand blood-soaked Rifians lie in wait. The people of Melilla only have two options: resist or die. But when all seems lost, a group of angels descend upon the city. They disguise themselves as Red Cross lady nurses, but those of us who know them aren't fooled. They're angels. The head of the angels hides behind the mask of a duchess. Sent by Her Majesty Queen Victoria Eugenie, she set up a hospital overnight. She taught the rest of the angels everything they know. A seemingly indestructible woman who answers to the name of Carmen. Angels like Magdalena, whose smile has healing powers. She's always there with a smile along with some affection. She radiates tenderness. Could anyone not love Magdalena? Angels such as Verónica, a shy angel who seeks refuge in the pharmacy amongst the ointments, pills, and powders, which she makes into miracle cures with her magical hands. Cures which do nothing when it comes to her own love sickness. Angels like Julia... who boarded a train to find her brother. She found him, but she has just had to bury him in the war heroes' cemetery with a medal and three-volley salute. But Julia will continue on in the hospital, because she's a lady nurse and her duty is to others, as though her destiny was preordained and she must dedicate her life to serving those who need her." ...to serving those who need her. So over the top. He doesn't even know her. "Julia's gesture perfectly encapsulates how these women are angels who've given up heaven so that we can continue to live on earth. Angels such as Pilar, with a steely exterior but a heart of gold. Her hand doesn't shake during surgery, but her soul does when she hears a patient crying. She pretends to be as hard as steel, but she's tender, like the love she yearns for." A bit cheesy. Maybe, but you love it. -Don’t you? You love it. -Absolutely not. So you won't let me kiss you? -If you kiss as badly as you write... -You'll have to find out. PICTURE FROM EL IMPARCIAL I can't believe it, there's nothing. It's unbelievable. -Not one word. -About what? About me! Not one word about me. What a bore, the ladies, the duchess... I gave him all his information and cooked for him, and this is what I get. What a scoundrel. I can't imagine it took much to make you spill the beans. You're defending him? If you were a real man, you'd find him and give him an earful. What should I say? That he should write an article all about you. Well, he owes me. He took me in like a fool. The next time I see him, I'll challenge him to a duel. Sound good? What he needs to do is get Pilar out of our way. I told him what I did in order to pave the road for him. What do you mean? He wrote all that to make her fall for him. It's obvious that's all he wants. -And you helped him? -Is that so wrong? -Well-- -Come on. After all the lies that woman told about us. The best thing that could happen is for him to get her out of the way. We'd be much happier. Finish your sandwich, darling. Verónica? I've been looking for you. I wanted to show you the medal they awarded my brother. The red trim is for war heroes. Take it. I want you to have it. In memory of Pedro. I can't accept it. Pedro had a letter when he died. He would have sent it from Málaga, but... he never arrived. In it he told my mother how he felt about you. But we hardly knew one another. "I've met a girl, her name is Verónica." He said he was going home and that he'd write when he got there. He said he'd come back for me. Why did he lie? Why did he get on that truck? I don't know. I really don't. But he had to go. If he hadn't insisted that they operate... he'd still be blind, but he'd be here, and he'd be alive. -I could have been his guide, his... -No, you don't know that. We can't know that, but I'm sure that his last thoughts were about you. That's why I want you to have this medal. I think it would make him very happy for you to have it. Please. Thank you. Your brother... was a good man. I know. Good evening. Oh, sorry! Why are you here again? Are you ill? Do you have a fever? -What is it? -I don't feel well. Why? Daniel and Larbi fought over me. What? A real fight, I had to separate them. It's so embarrassing. And I got all dizzy and I don't know if I'm ill again or if it was because of seeing them fight. They almost killed each other. -Don't laugh, I mean it-- -I'm not laughing, it's the champagne. Champagne? -I was with the photographer. -What? He asked me to travel the world with him. I said no right away in case he was serious. He's capable of anything. But I had such a good time. Daniel won't go home unless I go with him. Well, let him stay in Melilla. No, no, no! Pilar... Pilar! -Go to bed, Pilar. -One minute. But... Pilar! What are you doing? Good evening, madam. I'm sorry I didn't call earlier, but it’s been... -a complicated day. -Very complicated. And very long. I've just been told the coffin is in Málaga. She'll be here by tomorrow. I've been with Matilde's parents all afternoon. -I just sent my condolences via telegram. -You have no idea how grateful they are. The dedications in the newspapers are beautiful. Especially the one about angels. Those kinds of articles help people understand the work of our lady nurses. It's very welcome. Madam, I don’t know if you heard that the Chief of Military Health Care has asked to be replaced? -And it's because of Matilde. -That says a lot about him. What with everything that's happening even government ministers are clinging onto their posts. I don't think it's a good time for change, madam. Colonel Márquez knows everything that goes on here. Our situation. - I don't know if I'm making myself clear. -Perfectly. You always make yourself very clear. Navy fire from Souk El Arbaa to Cabo del Agua. Cabanellas' detachment is seeing no resistance. The cavalry is flattening everything from Mar Chica moving southwest. It's actually happening, Somarriba. Nador will be ours again in less than 12 hours. -And with barely any hand-to-hand. -Once the railway is cleared, our priority is to recover the hospital train. I trust that whoever replaces me is clear on that. And to reopen the first aid stations. We don't know what state they'll be in after six months. Colonel. I don't know who your benefactors are, but you're still in charge of health care. Orders from above. Very high up, I would wager. -General, I assure you I didn’t ask-- -I know, you have too much integrity. But it's... a pleasure for me to give this order. -Nobody would've compared to you, Colonel. -Thank you, General. Verónica! Verónica... -What? -Nothing, it's just... Well... Look, Verónica... I hate seeing you suffer here alone. I'm also alone. I don't know, maybe with time... I'm sure you'd grow fond of me. And who knows... Maybe you'd even grow to want me. -What do you say? -About what? I didn't ask! I don’t know where my head's at, I always beat around the bush. Will you marry me? Are you really asking me that here? Like this. You don't have to answer me now. I'll let you think about it. Take all the time you need. I won't... pressure you. But, Guillermo... how could you? Do you really think it's that easy? What did you think I would say? I don’t know. I really don't know. All I know is that... you'll never find anyone who will love you like I do. Never. I love you so much, Verónica. So much. Good morning. Chocolate? -How long have you been there? -Ages. I'm very worried about you, Magdalena. -You were sweating all night. -I didn't talk in my sleep, did I? Daniel... why didn't you tell my mother about the letter? I thought that if you hadn't told her, you might still be mulling it over. I wanted to tell you first. Good morning. How were you through the night? Terrible, Doctor. She has a raging fever. Aren’t you going to do something? She may have a temperature. It would be good for you to get some air, go for a walk, have a bath. A temperature? -She's been sweating all night. -Why don't you do the same? Please, I have to examine my patient. I'll be back soon. Excuse me. The way he's going, he'll end up in the hospital. -When is the wedding? -There isn't going to be one. But he's been saying everything is planned. He thinks we're getting married. Everyone does. My family, his family... I have to do something to stop it. You can help me, you have experience with... -cancelling a wedding. -Yeah. How should I do this? Well, I... No, I am not a good person to give advice about this. I'm going to have to go to Madrid to clear things up. Frankly, I thought you'd be happy about the promotion. That's true, Captain. I'm sorry if I seem underwhelmed... -But it hasn't come at the best time. -Nothing ever does. As captain you'll be able to request the unit you desire, so long as there's a space. Didn't you want to get out from behind a desk? Take advantage. - Are you happy, Captain? -Two detachments leave for Nador tomorrow. The first to enter will take the city. If I request it, I'll be there with them. Pedro and I always talked about it. I think I owe it to him. When we raise the flag, it'll be like he's there... -with me. -But he won't be. And no amount of flags or medals will change that, Andrés. I'm scared. I'm really scared. I'd like to be able to lie and get behind you, but I can't. I know that if you go there... we might never see each other again. We're going to win this war. What good is winning the war if we lose everything else? Tell me the truth. You've already decided, haven't you? I'm scared, too. Not of returning to the front... but of losing you, Julia. Clean that wound and take him to Dr. Garcés for me. Captain! I have some good news for you. The High Commissioner wants a field hospital in Nador. Wow, I don't know what to say. Go up to Gurugú, find out what condition it's in, and make the move there as soon as possible. Yes, sir. I'll take this opportunity to replace materials. I'm staying on as Chief of Health Care, so I'm not being moved, and though it's not necessary to bring the wedding forward, we're still having it on the 25th. Relax, it's almost done. -What are you doing here? -Looking at you. -It's not illegal. -I'll be right back. Please, you're putting me in an awkward position. There's nothing wrong with looking. I crave it. In fact, I've been craving it since I woke up this morning. Go away. -Being angry is of no use. -Out of here, now. I'm being serious. Or you won't see me again. Julia... Julia. What are you doing here? It's from the day he died. He looks handsome, doesn't he? Yes. Very handsome. I should have made sure he got on that boat. Why didn't I go home with him? I don't know why I stayed, I've done nothing good here. Julia... Grab some gauze and bandages and come with me. Come on. Thank you, you can go. Get in. Get in the truck. -The two of us can't go alone. -I need to be with you, Julia. -Let's just go back-- -I need to talk to you alone. Get in. Wouldn't it be more sensible to watch the road? I don't think there's anything sensible about us, do you? Us. What are we? I don't know and I don't want to know, Julia. All I know is when I'm with you, I feel things I've never felt before. Don't say that, please. How much longer are we going to go on feeling one thing and saying another? -I spend all day missing you. -You're about to get married. I know... and I don't know what to do. What do you want to do? Have an affair? Come all the way out here to see each other. No, we can't... -Who are they? -Stay calm. -Come on, out of the truck! -What's the problem? There's no problem, Captain. Come on, out. -Out! -Take it easy. Don't touch her! We're medics from the Red Cross, okay? Relax! -Yes, we know. The Red Cross. -We're not going anywhere. No, Fidel! You're the doctor, Captain... I don't need her. -Wait. -You're going to obey, right? Captain Calderón and Julia Ballester's ambulance was found abandoned. Why was Julia there? You're here to cure him. -If he dies, you die. -No! The two of you die. I'm thinking about going back to Madrid with you. -Really? -Yes. Larbi, I have to go... You are going to Madrid, and you won't be back, I know that. Why did he go with her? The two of them alone... They've run away together. They've gone together. If this were your last night and you could do anything, what would you do? We are going to see the pyramids, Pilar. -What do you mean? -Exactly that. -You can start packing. -No! Are you going? You're leaving? Do you care whether I stay or go? How did the rebels know they were in the ambulance? -Who the hell told them? -Have you spoken to your people? No, I didn't say anything. You can't trust these people! No, what are you going to do to us? -Let her go! Leave her! -Be quiet! Subtitles: Leia Fell-Murray
