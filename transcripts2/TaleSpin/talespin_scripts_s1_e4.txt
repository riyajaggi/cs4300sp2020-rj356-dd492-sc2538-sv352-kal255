 - Voilà! - Fabulous! To help his friends escape, Kit pretends to join the pirates, which makes Baloo angry. So angry that he quits Higher For Hire and leaves Kit behind with Don Karnage. [Karnage] Get it loaded, men! We are leaving in ten minutes. [indistinct chattering] [alarm buzzes] [chuckles] It's show time! Ready or not, Cape Suzette, here I come. [Rebecca] I know it's closing time, but do you have any cargo planes for sale? You do? Great! I'll be by tomorrow. - Now all I need is a pilot. - What about Baloo? Now, honey, I told you. He's gone away. It's just us two. Though I wish he were here. [Shere Khan] Yes. Yes, but of course... No. Mr. Khan, sir, I just figured it out! - In a moment, Doctor. - Yes, but this is important. - Ow! - It had better be. I've been studying what the pirates stole from you over the last week. The point, Doctor? Well, it's possible that they have built a machine that can focus the energy of the stone. And? Well, basically, Don Karnage could now have in his possession a lightning gun. Absurd! [explosions] [yelling] Lookety look. They scurry like the little ants. Ah. Once more with feeling, Ratchet. Missed, you naughty boy! [coughs] Try again, please. [explosion] What's going on? The captain is blowing the stuffing out of Cape Suzette. Is he crazy? [chuckles] Yup. - There. See? I told you. - Yes. I believe you. Thousands wouldn't. Get me the airfield. - [Karnage giggles] - What are you doing? Ah, there you are, my boy. Come, come, come. Join the festivities. [whispers] What?! They think to stop me with their puny planes? [gunfire] [groans] Take that! And that! And even that! Attention! Attention! Hello, wonderful people of Cape Suzette. Allow me to introduce myself, a man who needs no introduction. I am Don Karnage. Don Karnage! For years I have tried to visit your fair city, but you have always shooted at me! However, now that I am here, you will hand over all your money and valuable nickety-nacks to me. Okey-dokey? I didn't hear a yes. We shall have to soften them up a bit. [yelling] - Mommy! - Don't worry. I've got you, baby. Are you not glad you are up here on the winning side instead of with that loser pilot? I gotta do something. Mm. Barbecue a few more buildings, Ratchet, and then we shall begin the biggest plunder of all time. An entire city! - Put that back! - Make me. [faint voices] Oops! Dead end. [pants] - [pounding] - Company. Ow! Ooh! Ow! Why me? The radio room. Mayday! Mayday! Stop that! What are you thinking? Thanks, Captain. His head is way too soft. We need something harder. - [Kit] Mayday, please! Mayday! - The radio! I've been too easy on that boy. Shoot it off. [bullets ricochet] Somebody get the blowtorch. [Kit] If anyone can hear me, anyone who flies... This is Lil' Britches. Please, whoever you are, get word to Baloo. Tell him Lil' Britches has a message for him. [lively music] [Baloo laughs] Hey, Louie! Ain't this the life? No bosses, no troubles, no obligations. Yeah, coz. You keep saying that every five minutes and you'll believe it in a year or two. Hey! It's true. Anyone here named Baloo? You're looking at him, ace. There's a distress call for you from someone named Lil' Britches. What? [Kit] Can't stop them from wrecking the city, but I tried. Please tell Baloo. Tell Papa Bear. I'm his navigator. Louie, he didn't double-cross me. I gotta get back to Cape Suzette. Hey, man, weren't you paying attention? Cape Suzette is a deathtrap. Doesn't matter. I was all wrong about the kid. Think, Baloo. It's miles away. How are you going to get there in time? - Overdrive. - All the way? Your motors will fry. You'll melt your plane. Maybe. But I gotta save Kit. Right, boy. I have you... now. Hold together, baby. There is nowhere to run, you naughty nuisance. Give me the stone. - Stone? - The one behind your back. No more guessing-type games. Oh, this? OK. Catch! [screams] Oh... boy! Get that kid! You going somewhere? [Kit groans] [tuts] My boy, my boy, you cannot make the fool of me twice. Yes? No? - Hey! - Interesting toy. - Oh, but I broke it. - My board. So, Kit Cloudkicker... you will kick the bucket instead of the clouds, eh? [giggles] I make a joke! From now on, I erase you from my list of noble pirates. Noble? You're nothing but a cheap crook, Karnage. Drop him! No! No! [yells] [yells] - Baloo. - I got you, Lil' Britches. Someone saved the boy! Shoot them down! Shoot them down! You came back for me. You forgot this. Didn't I learn you? A navigator wears it that way. Oh, great. What next? Baloo, the lightning gun. Get them. Get them now! Hold on to your kneecaps. Fry them! Fry them! Time for a little hide and sneak. [Karnage] Where did they go? Burn the bridge! [Karnage] Away, my men. Back to pillaging. [male voice on radio] Come in, Higher For Hire. Come in. This is Higher For Hire. - Becky, I still don't like that name. - Baloo? We're coming home. - [Molly] Yay, Baloo! - [Rebecca laughs] Come on, Becky. Throw your stuff in the Duck and let's scoot. Baloo, I told you, I am not leaving. Oh, be sensible, will you? I can't. This is my home. But Karnage is going to fricassee the city any second. You talk to her, Kit. No, Papa Bear. I stay too. What? OK, Lil' Britches. Me too. But there's not gonna be much left after Karnage is through. Whoa, whoa, people. I'm not the hero type. But you're the only pilot who can do it. Nope. I'm not listening. [hums] - I can't hear a thing. - But I have a plan. Not a chance. That gun will flambé my plane before I take off. Not if the lightning can't touch it. You think these tires will really stop the lightning? [grunts] Ms. Science says rubber and electricity don't mix. I hope she's right. Good. Those are the last ones, Baloo. - Oh, Molly, sweetie. - Engines ready, Wildcat? Huh? Oh, they're fine. 'Course you burned out your overdrive for ever. Forget it. Well, I guess it's time to pay Captain Karnage a visit, Kit. Right! - Right! - Now, hold on, Becky. It may not be my plane, but they're my tires. I go. OK. Let's pull chocks. We're off to bag us a lightning gun. [sirens wail] [Baloo] Don't look now, Karnagey, but we're coming to bust up your lawn party. Karnagey? Tell me, foolish flyer, what is your name? So I can carve it on your tombstone. - [chuckling] The name's Baloo. - And me, Kit Cloudkicker. I am not believing this. That stupid pilot and the kid too? They make me very, very angry. Blow them away! Time to lightning up their lives. Fire! What?! Again! - [Kit] We did it! - [Baloo] It worked! Get him! Wahoo! Nothing can stop us now. - Baloo! - [gunfire] Hold on. I'll try losing them in town. [crashing] [Baloo] Ha ha! If you can't fly, don't mess with the eagles! They're still coming? Quick, quick! Close the beak. Close the beak! - We're not gonna make it, are we? - Don't know, but we're gonna try. Faster, faster! Close it faster! Sorry about this, baby. [screaming] [Baloo] We're in a tailspin. I can't hold her steady. Just give me a few more seconds, baby. Hmm. A pity. That was a pilot to be reckoned with. Scramble the planes. [coughs] Kit! Baloo! My plane. To your posts, men. We will fight to the last man! [gunfire] Then again... Retreat! Retreat! Full speed behind! [Molly] Mommy! Guys, you did it! [sighs] Yeah. We did it. - Go away! - [Kit] Baloo, just come out and fly. Look, without the Duck I'm grounded. Hey! Give me that back. Stop being such a baby. It's been a week since Ms. Cunningham and Molly got an apartment and all you've done is sit on your duff. A week? I haven't flown in a week? OK. Let's see this plane of Becky's. Baloo, you're gonna love it. Yeah, yeah. Don't blow a gasket. What? - [Rebecca] Surprise! - [Wildcat] Happy New Year! - [Molly] Surprise! - [Kit] Surprise! The Sea Duck! Yeah. Good as pretty and twice as new. - My baby! - Well... Actually, she's my baby. I paid to have it put back together. I own it again. - But, but... - So... you gonna be my pilot or what? What do you say, Papa Bear? Wahoo! I'm just doing this for you till I can buy the Duck back. - Of course. - I can't be tied down or nothing. [Becky] All right, Baloo. And about that name. I still don't like Higher For Hire. [Becky laughs] Get used to it, Baloo. ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh Oh-oh oh-oh oh [Baloo] Ha ha ha! ♪ TaleSpin ♪
