 Yow! Shark attack! Shark attack! - I've been bit. I... - Wakey-wakey, Baloo. Kit. Oh, baby. You scared me out of about a year's worth of flight time. Come on. We have to be at Miss Cunningham's apartment in ten minutes. No, siree, bub. Old Baloo's not going shopping today. Nothing doing. Mr. Shark says you're coming with me. Oh, come on, kid. I was having a nice snooze. Besides, this ritzy part of town always gives me the willies. Can't we forget this and go back to the docks? Don't be such a whiney baby. If you don't go shopping with Miss Cunningham, she'll stay home. If she stays home, I don't get my first baby-sitting job. You want to baby-sit? Yeah. I want to prove to our boss that she can depend on me. Really? Well, that... and the money's good. You sure you don't want to change your mind, partner? I'm sure. Now, please move. But I hate going shopping with Miss Cunningham. It's "Baloo, carry this" and "Oh, aren't these cute?" It's enough to drive me stark raving... happy. Just telling Kit what a lovely day to go shopping... Cut the baloney, Baloo. Oh, Kit, come in. Oh, so this is where all our profits go. Don't start that again. Molly! Your sitter's here, honey! Kit's here? Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! Nice to see you too, kid. Now, Molly, you know there's no running in the house. Sorry, Kit. Here's some money for an ice cream, but don't go any farther than the corner store. Got it? - Got it. - Got it. Bye, Mommy. I will be extra specially very good. Fine, sweetheart. I'm serious, Kit. Your job is to watch out for Molly, no matter what. No matter what. I won't let you down, Miss Cunningham. Come along, Sunny Jim. The white sales beckon. Well, Molly, why don't we...? Molly? [Molly shouts] Oh. Can't see. Uh-oh. Horsey fall down. Yeah. Horsey fall down. Holy prop wash. Look at this mess. - I'll help you, Kit. - Yeah. Great. Boy, Miss Cunningham would skin me if she saw this. Kit, look at my trampoline. One, two, fly! No! You're a good pretender, Kit. That looks like it really hurts. I know, Kit. Let's play "High Diver Queen". No! Listen, Molly. Your mom told me to watch out for you, so stop getting into trouble. I'm sorry, Kit. I'll be really good. Good. Now, how about we listen to your favorite radio show? Faster than a speeding airship, more powerful than a turbine, able to leap city blocks in a single bound... It's Danger Woman! Kids, tell you mom to buy you Danger Woman's favorite food, Frostipep ice cream. Oh, Kit. I want some Danger Woman ice cream. Listen, Molly. If I take you for ice cream now, will you take your nap as soon as we get home? Oh, yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! I don't wanna ride in this sissy wagon. Wagon? No, no. This is the Dangermobile. Oh. Vroom! Vroom! I think I'm getting the hang of this baby-sitting stuff. Kit, let's go downtown. Sorry, Danger Woman. If I take you past the corner store, your mom will explode. - [explosion] - Oh-oh. There she went. No, no. That's the big guns on the cliffs. They must be shooting at air pirates. - Air pirates? - Don't worry. No pirates have ever gotten past those cannons. Not with Danger Woman on the job. Vroom! Ha ha! You missed me, you sisters of a warthog. Just make sure we stay out of range. Yes? No? Yeah. What is taking you so long? - You get in first. - You get in yourself. I always go first. - You get in... - Quiet! Either you two get in the submarine or I will use your worthless hides for seat covers. Are you sure this is safe, Captain? Why, of course, Mad Dog. - Your well-being is my prime concern. - Doh! Dumptruck, get off of me! Now, do not forget to remember... Sneak into the harbor, rob the place blind and do not be seen. Um... What should we steal, Captain? Do I have to write you a shopping list? Anything, everything! Including the kitchen sink. Where shall we reach you when we're done? Behind the old tugboat wreck, away from those nasty cannons. Is that where we're gonna land? - Who said anything about landing? - [teeth chattering] Oh, boy. This submarine sure handles rough. Will you get off of me and get on that bike? How come I got to pedal? - 'Cause I went to school. - Did not. Well, I saw a picture of one once. Yeah. OK. [Dumptruck] What's this old net for anyway? It's supposed to keep out sharks and stuff. Ah. Too bad it's busted. [laughs] All right, Dumptruck. Full speed ahead. Watch it! You're pedaling backwards, you moron! [Dumptruck] Well, beg my pardon. [Mad Dog] Oh, just pedal! No, no, Molly. Stay in the wagon... the Dangermobile. You might need to answer a call from the Chief of Police. - Oh, right. - Hey, mister. A Frostipep, please. You got it, sport. Gimme, gimme! Here. Just please sit down until I pay the man. - Here you are, mister. - Whee! The Dangermobile is called into action! So, Molly, how's the...? Yipes! - Vroom vroom! - Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! [Mad Dog] Gee, we've never been in Cape Suzette Harbor before. I'm gonna take a look around. I don't see nothing. Oh-h-h... How's about I pedal awhile, huh? Make way for the Dangermobile! Sorry. Excuse me. Bye. Baloo? Baloo! What do you think of these towels? - Yow! - Hey! Nah. Couldn't have been. Oh, no. Not the docks. Look. Shipping docks. And there's a big, juicy cargo plane. [panting] Great. How close is it? Real close. Jumpin' jiminy! He's too close. Dive! Dive! Hi, purdy birdie. Kit, did you see me? I'm a real good driver, huh? Wow, it nearly got us. Check the scope again. So? What do you see? Uh... Cape Suzette. - The dock? - No. - The cannery? - No. Well, what part do you see? All of it. Aagh! [panting] We gotta get back, Molly. If your mom gets home before we do, I'm sunk. Danger Woman wants to go pirate hunting. Molly, there aren't any pirates in Cape Suzette. From now on, you pedal. See? Pirates. I told you, Kit. Kids! The Captain told us not to be seen. Well, then we'll take them with us. - Oh! - Molly! Let her go! Run, Molly, run! You pirates don't know who you're messing with. I'm Danger Woman. Let's scram! How'd you do that? All evildoers are scared of Danger Woman. Well, come on, Molly. We gotta get you home right now. [purring] Yum yum! [splashing] Get me the Harbor Patrol fast. There's a sea monster in the bay. Molly, you gotta promise me you won't tell your mom we went down to the docks. I promise, Kit, and I always keep my promises. Don't I, Mommy? Oh, Miss Cunningham. What are you doing here? Wondering where my daughter disappeared to. Let me explain... You were meant to look after Molly, protect her... I did. - Go easy, Rebecca. Let him explain. - Explain, my foot! He's just like you, Baloo. Reckless and irresponsible. Hey! I thought I could depend on you, Kit, but I guess I was wrong. - But, but... - Out! Come on, kiddo. Man, there's no point trying to talk when she's that steamed. But, Baloo, it wasn't my fault. - I did everything I was supposed to. - That's the way it goes some days. Hey, Baloo. The Harbor Patrol is using dynamite to chase a sea monster out of the bay. Do you have any tartar sauce? You hear that, kid? Forget all this and let's go watch. No. Miss Cunningham thinks I let her down. I've got to convince her to give me one more chance. Well, lots of luck, partner. You're gonna need it. [panting] A sea monster in Cape Suzette. What's this city coming to? - Yeah. What next? - [explosion] This out to chase that critter out of here. [explosion] Look! There it goes. That-a way! - But the channel is back that way. - Oops. Molly, honey, put this away for Mommy. Just like Baloo. Irresponsible... [Kit] Please, Miss Cunningham, I need to talk to you. Go away, young man. I have nothing more to say to you. Fishhooks! She's never been this mad at me. How can I get her to let me in? I could tell her there's a giant squid crawling up her waterfall. Holy cow! There is a giant squid crawling up her waterfall! And put this away too, honey. Oh, and here's some Frostipep for you. Thanks. Now, where's that other carton? [purring] Yum! - Ah, here it is. Molly... - You call me, Mommy? Put this Frostipep with the other one I... just gave... Oh! Oh! - [screams] - Too late. - Hello. Operator? - Oh! Aagh! [Baloo] Sea monster! Ha ha! That Wildcat. Great flaming cat whiskers! Hello. Wildcat? Let me talk to Baloo. I'll get him, Kit. Hold the phone. I am! I am! Hey, Baloo! Phone! Not now! I gotta save Kit from the sea monster! Kit, maybe you should call back when you're not being eaten. I don't wanna play anymore. Oh! Molly, you get in here this instant! Time to get off the phone, Molly... Uh-oh. Hold her, Kit! [Baloo] Holy schmoly! Aagh! Ha ha! Hey, kiddo. Some ride, huh? I'm ready for my nap now. You sit tight, OK? Great catch, skipper. Yeah. Now tell me what in blue blazes is going on? Later. We've gotta save Rebecca. Hold on to your kneecaps. Take that, you big sushi! And this... And that... How did that slimy...? Whoa! Baloo, when did you teach the Sea Duck to hover like this? Hover? This plan can't hover. Uh-oh. Oh, baby. This is getting serious. Looks like we've got a hitchhiker. And a practical joker at that. [Mad Dog] If we go back empty-handed, Captain's gonna blow his stack. - See where we are. - Okey-dokey. But I ain't using that perio-scope no more. Jumpin' jiminy! Sink! Sink! - You mean, "Dive! Dive!" - [clunk] Oh, I'm so sorry. You were right. That is a sink. Ha ha ha! Heave-ho, me hearty. Mad Dog, let's go home. - Watch out for buildings, Baloo! - I would if I could see 'em! Cut that out, you big sea slug! I'm flying us out over the ocean before our pal grabs another high-rise. - [slurps and purrs] - Come on! It's OK now, Molly. He can't touch you. Oh! Kit! Kit! It's the ice cream. The squid wants the ice cream. [Baloo] You gotta get rid of this squid, kid! No kidding. Hang on. Ah-ha! Red hot peppers. This will have a lot more pep than Frostipep. What is keeping those underwater weenies? Ah-ha! My master thieves have return-ed. Simply hi, Captain. How's every little thing? Never mind about that. What treasures have you brought me? You may now shower me with them. Come, come. Well, um... Well, we just got you what you asked for. A kitchen sink. Sink?! I don't need no stinking sink! He sank our sink. Here, sweet-tooth. Try this. Hey! That's my Frostipep! - No, Molly. Don't! - Aagh! Hold her steady, Baloo. I'm going out. [purring] Yum yum! Kit! I got you, Molly. Just hold on. You two idiots are going back in there and stealing something good. Something special, something grand. Give me something big. Whee! Well, as soon as Baloo picks us up, I'll take you home. Oh, do we have to? Let's do it again. Yeah, but why say, "Dive! Dive!" when you're about to sink? 'Cause you don't say, "Sink! Sink!" - Row! row! - Aye-aye, Captain, Captain. - [door opens] - Mommy! Molly! Kit, get back in here. Go easy, Becky. You should have seen him tackle that monster. - He's the squid-fightingest little... - Hush! Come here, young man. Kit, can you forgive me? If it hadn't been for you, I don't know what might have happened to Molly or me. Well, uh... Gee, thanks. Of course, if you want to baby-sit again, you've got to complete your job. - Huh? - Put Molly to bed. Come on, kiddo. I'll read you a story. Great! Kit? Will you clunk your head on the chairs for me again? Uh... no.
