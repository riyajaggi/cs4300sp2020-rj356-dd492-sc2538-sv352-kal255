 You are going to make me rich! A living fable. The only Inkara in captivity. [cackles] [Inkara] Momma! Oh! Molly, what are you doing? Getting beautiful. Oh, honey. Not now. Don't you know Mom's got to go? Yep. That's why I got made up. Now can we go? - "We"? - Yeah. Remember? You're taking me to the zoo and the park and you're going to get me some double-triple-ripple ice cream. Oh, no. I forgot. Oh. Molly, I'm sorry, hon, but Mom's gotta go to work today. You always have to work. I know, pumpkin. We'll go tomorrow, I promise. That's what you said yesterday. Mom, I miss you. Oh... That's it. Molly, you're spending the day with me. - For really? - For really. Yahoo! [Rebecca] No more excuses! [crashing] Where are my mangoes? - [Baloo outside] Bring it up. Oh! - Stop that! Not you, her. - [Kit] It's slipping! - [crashing] [Baloo] Rebecca! Later! I'm busy! - Huh? - Not you, him. [Baloo] Hey, it wasn't his fault. That thing's too heavy. Get me my mangoes by noon or stick 'em in your ear. Capisce? [crashing] I know they won't fit. It's just a figure of... Oh! Call you back. Oh, Molly. I asked you to stay out of trouble and have fun. I was having fun. Mom, can you play with me now? - Later. Mom's busy. - [phone rings] Hello? Careful. Careful! You... Keep your hat on. Hi, Kit. Hi, Baloo. Wanna play? Sorry, muffin. Kinda busy. [yells] Stop! Stop! This throttle's jammed. Guess you're too busy to play too. - I'd love to, Molly cat. - You would? The only thing I can play now is "Gotta get that wrench, Jack." Sounds like fun. [grunts] Uh-oh. [crashing] Get that brat outta here! I've never seen such incompetence in my entire life! I'm so, so sorry, sir. Terribly, terribly sorry. Molly, what are you doing? [Rebecca] Mr. Macnee's cargo has to ship tonight. Get it aboard and be careful. Molly, I told you to stay out of trouble. Now, look. You made that man mad. Uh-uh. He's always mad. How come you're so nice to him? He's a customer. He's paying Mommy money. So just stay out of the way, OK? [groaning] - "Stay out of the way." Nnurr! - [crashing] You imbeciles! [squeals, giggles] - I've had enough! - Nnurr! If your people don't take better care of what's mine, I'll take my business elsewhere... Oh, boy. A baby buffalo. [squeaks] Mommy! Mommy! Don't worry, little guy. I'm not gonna hurt you. - You wanna play? - [purring] Yahoo! Hey, Kit, Baloo! Looky what I got. A buffalo. - Mommy! - Not now, Molly. Wait till I show you to Mom. [Rebecca] Please accept my assurance that your cargo will be perfectly safe. [grumbles] Ridiculous... [phone rings] - Mom, looky. - Hello? - Can I keep him? - Fine. Just go outside, OK? No, Henry. Not till noon. His name's uh... Henry! Wanna pet him? Molly, I'm busy. Out. Go take Henry for a walk. [Rebecca] No. I said noon. Now, look... Guess that'll do all right. Your house is all done, Henry. - Henry? - Momma! ♪ Doo-dee-doo, doo-dee-doo ♪ Here comes the king of the castle ♪ Hey, where are you going? - Momma. - Momma? You want your momma? Momma. Sorry, Henry, boy. No momma buffaloes around here. [sad squeaking] I know how you feel. I miss my momma too. Know what? I'll be your momma. - Momma! - And I won't be too busy for you. Molly! Oh, what's she want? [Rebecca] Time to go home! - I'm having a party, Mom. Wanna come? - Not now, Molly. - [Rebecca] 20... No, 21... - [Molly] Figure. Looks like it's just gonna be you and me, Henry. - Momma! Momma! - Henry! Where are you trying to go? - Momma. - To your momma? Oh. No, sirree. I'm your momma. Uh-uh-uh. Momma says gotta wash your hands first. What are you doing way up there? [deep voice] Momma. [massive belch] Don't you know anything? You're supposed to dry your hands after you wash them. Molly? Molly Elizabeth Cunningham! What have you done? It wasn't me, Mom. Henry did it. He got real big... Molly, don't you dare fib to me. I'm not fibbing, Mom. Looky. Big. Come on, Henry. Big. Young lady, I don't have time for this. Clean up this mess now. Momma never has time for anything. Especially not for me. [sniffs] You're all I got, Henry. Come here, pumpkin. Momma's gotta finish her work pretty soon. How about you take your bath and get ready for bed and Momma will read you a story? Read me Gladys and the Gorilla? Yup. Your favorite. - You promise? - I promise. - [phone rings] - Oh, not again. Hello? What is it now? She never keeps her promises. You'll see. No. Tell Baloo to deal with it himself. I've got to spend some time with Molly. - [crashing] - But, Miss Cunningham, I think... - [Rebecca hangs up] - [Macnee] Thunderation! Idiots! Hey, hey. Cool your engines. Stop stopping me and help me find it. - The Inkara's escaped. - What? [Baloo] Count your marbles again, mister. There's no such thing. That's only a fable. Besides, the crate's still locked. Sshh! - There's where he went! - Well, let me see now. A 12-foot critter escaped through a six-inch hole. Oh, don't tell me. He shrunk. Exactly! The Inkara's big and mean and dangerous, but only as long as he's wet, see? If you get him dry, voom! He shrinks down to a cute little thing, like so, always crying for his momma. [both gasp] Molly's buffalo! Your bath first. Hope you like getting wet. - [Baloo] Becky, open up! - Now what? [Rebecca squeals] - Where's Molly? - That pet of hers is dangerous. What are you talking about? [Molly laughs] No! Don't get him wet! There he goes again. - [gasps] Molly! - Back! He's mine! - [whip cracks] - Mommy! - Whoa! - Molly! [yelling] [Rebecca] Molly! Molly! Where's it taking them? To the Valley of the Inkara. It's going home to its momma. [Rebecca] Baloo, come on. We've been kidnapped by a flying sponge and you think it's all right?! Guess he is sorta squishy. Dry off, Henry. Molly! No! - [Kit] Whoa! - [Molly] I didn't mean this fast. Henry! You come up here right this instant. Run for it, Molly. He's dangerous. Boy, are you dumb. Does that look dangerous? [sad roaring] He won't bite, silly. Henry, this is Kit. Great. Glad to meet you. Come on, Molly. Cape Suzette's that way. I'm not going without Henry. Oh, fine. Bring him along. Mr. Macnee will be glad to get him back. Forget it! I'm his momma and he belongs to me. Moms can't let their kids down, you know. Molly, you can pretend all you want, but you're never gonna be that thing's mother. If he has one, she'd be that way, toward that star. The Inkara Valley. That's where Macnee captured him. Then that's where we're going. Come, Henry. Are you crazy? Think about your mom. She'll be worried sick. She doesn't even know I'm gone. [Rebecca] Where could they be? Maybe we've missed them. Oh, Baloo, this is all my fault. If only I'd spent more time with Molly this would never... Easy, Becky. We'll find them. Baloo! Up ahead. There they are. There they are indeed. Pity to put holes in that pretty hide, but a stuffed Inkara's better than none. No! My baby! He cut her oil line. Hang on. We're going down! [Molly sneezes] - [Kit] You cold? - [Molly] Nah. I'm not as cold as before. Henry's almost dry now. Oh, no! You know what this means? That! [both yell] Some cloud surfer you are. Well, excuse me for saving your pigtails. - [crashing] - What was that? Oh, man. Anybody get the number of that mountain? Oh, Baloo... Baloo, Macnee's gone! He's after the kids. We've got to follow him. He won't catch them while they're in the air. Which is where we'll be as soon as I fix this oil line. Don't worry. He won't find us. You kids! Where are you? Come out in the open! Not a chance, creep face! Would you be quiet?! I ain't got all night! Molly, listen. You get Henry to the river. I'll cover you. Go. Quick! There she goes! Where? Blast you, boy! There's nothing there. If you're lying, boy... Now I remember. - She dried up and shrunk. - What are you...? I've had enough! [Kit yells] - Well? - Pretty good for a kid. [Kit] Shouldn't be long now, Molly. Henry's almost home with his momma. Momma! - Yeah. - What's wrong? He'll have his mom. I still won't have mine. Hey, your mom's probably out there looking for you right now. I wouldn't count on it. [thunder claps] Getting sorta stormy, huh? Nah. I seen worse. - [loud thunder clap] - Just not so close up. Getting pretty dry. Molly, we better fly down before we fall down. [wind howls] [Rebecca] Molly! Molly, it's your mom. That's impossible. [Kit] Rebecca! Baloo! I heard 'em, Baloo! I heard 'em! Baloo! Baloo! Baloo! That way! Becky, no! It's too dangerous! It doesn't matter. She's my daughter. [Kit] Rebecca! Molly! Give me your hand. No. Henry needs me. Moms are supposed to take care of their kids. Please, Molly! I love you! I promise I'll spend more time with you. No! Molly! Molly! Mom! Mom! Rebecca, look. Not so tight, you big lug. Baloo! Bring us in! [Molly] Come, Henry! Before you dry off! Got him! - Momma! - You saved him, Mom. I'm glad, pumpkin, but you're what's important to me. Momma. [Kit] That must be it, Molly. The Valley of the Inkara. - Momma. - But where's Henry's mom? [Inkaras call] Momma, Momma, Momma! Now, listen. When your mom gives you ice cream, don't gobble it up so fast, OK? You'll get a tummy ache. And try to stay dry, so you don't catch cold, OK? I'm gonna miss you, little guy. No! Yeah. You're gonna help me catch 'em all now. Them skins are worth a fortune. You do as I say and I'll share it with you, and if you don't... - Let him go, creep face, or else! - Or else what? This! OK, Molly! [groaning] Get him off! Get him off! Didn't your momma tell you it's not polite to sit on people? Now, let me get this straight. It was all because of this big monster that gets teensy-weensy when it's dry? Right? Oh, you fools! There were dozens of them. Take me back. I'll share it with you. I will. We'll be millionaires. Come on! Right. Listen, why don't we just take you for a nice long rest, huh? A little safe cell far away from the big, bad boogey monsters. Nice work, Kit. Well, big day tomorrow. The joint's all ours. - You mean... - Yup. The boss is taking the day off. Said something about having really important business. "Once upon a time, there was a brave little girl and her big squishy pet and her mom who loved her very much." That's not how Gladys and the Gorilla goes, Mom. It does now!
