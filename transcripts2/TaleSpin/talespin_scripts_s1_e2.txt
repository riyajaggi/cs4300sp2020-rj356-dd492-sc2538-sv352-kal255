 that had been stolen by Don Karnage and his air pirates. While trapped at Louie's place, Kit managed to hide the jewel and then hitch a ride to safety from Don Karnage with a pilot named Baloo. In return, Kit offered to help Baloo save his failing air cargo business by splitting the reward for the stolen jewel. [snoring] [alarm clock] Baloo, it's already 10am. [yawns] Nothin's getting me out of this chair. The treasure. Ter-reasure! Oh, kid, you just said my two favorite words. [lively Latin music] Well, man, what a beat. I'm gonna be rich. Ho-ho! I'm gonna have dough. Hee-hee! Oh, dig it, yeah. Whoa! If we don't get to Louie's, this place is gonna be shut down. Relax, kid. The bank wouldn't send anyone this early. - You hope. - [knocking] [laughs] Just a customer. - Good morning, I'm... - We're closed, lady. Come back when the sun's warm, like June. Bye-bye. [grunts] Oh! If this is how you treat customers, buster, it's no wonder this business is failing. Oh, back off, lady. You act like you own this place. - I do. - What? When you didn't pay your loan this morning, the bank sold the deed to me. Told ya. They didn't even give me time to brush my teeth. You must be Baloo. The bank says you're a terrific pilot. Well, that's true. I'd be inclined to add sloppy, careless and rude. What? And just who are you, sister? Rebecca Cunningham, Business major. I've been looking for a failing company like this for some time. Urgh! And now that I've sunk my life savings into it, I'm going to turn this place into a real money maker. Yes. This definitely needs a woman's touch. - Now, listen you... - Sounds terrific, lady. - I'll bet you do just great here. - Why, thank you. - Kid! - Forget her. Remember the treasure. Hey, yeah, yeah. Well, enjoy yourself, Miss Manager. - Kit and me are off to Louie's place. - Not in my plane, you aren't. Now just a prop-spinning minute. The Sea Duck is mine. Not according to the bank. Oh, that's it! Mommy? Do I still have to wait in the car? Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Come see our new place. This is my daughter, Molly. We'll stay here until I find an apartment. Swell. Wow! Can I keep my room this messy? Now, let's be reasonable, lady. That plane is my baby. Fine. $50,000 and she's yours. In the meantime, I have an opening for a staff pilot. Hey, if you think I'm flying for you, brown-eyes, you got your hair tied too tight. Louie's. Louie's. Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah. Come to think of it, I'd love to be your pilot, Becky. Good. And it's Rebecca, not Becky. Now, who else do we have on staff? Kit Cloudkicker, ma'am. I'm the navigator. Hey, can I be the tail-gunner? Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah! No, honey. You're too young. Oh! I bet being a pilot is the funnest thing in the whole world. Used to be. Gosh! Suddenly I've got an office, a plane and two of my very own employees. Hey, Baloo, I finally fixed that sewer pipe. You want the old one? Make that three. Our mechanic, Wildcat. Wildcat, meet Rebecca Cunningham, our new boss. Really? Well, you smell pretty good for a boss. Thanks. This part of the guy was all clogged up. He was saying, "Help me, help me! I can't breathe. I got a cold." This is a mechanic? He couldn't tell a screwdriver from a bus driver. Oh, yeah? Watch. Oh, Wildcat. I think there's something wrong with the phone. You could be right. You oughta be more careful. Three, two, one... - [phone rings] - It's for you. [chuckles] You were saying? Well, at least something works around here. Er, Mr. Khan? Mr. Khan? [teeth chattering] Speak. Uh, uh... I have an update on the stone, sir. It's been found? Uh... Not exactly, sir. Uh... But you'll be happy to know we located our pilot, safe and... Where is the stone? [gulps] It's been st-st-stolen. By whom? Air p-p-p-pirates. I've spent years building Khan Industries into the biggest corporation in the world and I've discovered that business is like a jungle. You see, there are the eaters... - [gasps] - ...and there are the eatens. Find those pirates. [gulps] Yes, sir. [chuckles] Bon appétit. Look, Mommy. I'm done. Fabulous! Get out here, Baloo, let me take a look. Forget it, lady! I'm not going out in public like this. If you ever want to fly the Sea Duck again, you get out here on the double! All right, all right. Oh, I feel like a flying fool. What?! What did you do to my plane? Isn't it wonderful? And, incidentally, you look terrific. From now on you're gonna get noticed. Ooh. I'm telling you no one's gonna hire a pilot dressed like a flying soda jerk. Oh, no? What if I told you I just landed us the sizeable Fandango Mango account? You're pulling my propeller. Is this Higher for Hire? Why, yes. I'm the owner, Rebecca... - Mangoes. Which plane, ma'am? - The pretty one. What happened to Baloo's Air Service? Higher for Hire is cuter. All right. I made the deal, now you deliver the goods. Can I go too, Mommy? Please, oh please. Please, please, please? - Sorry, sweetie. - But I promised Lucy. Well, Lucy looks scared right now, but maybe she'll be ready to fly next time. OK, Kit. Thanks. Boy, we sure put one over on that old Becky. Oh, she's not so bad. I kinda like her. Well, maybe she knows business, but she's got a lot to learn about planes. Take the stick, Lil' Britches, while I climb out of this monkey suit. Roger, skipper. [Karnage on radio] Attention, my noble pirates. This is Don Karnage here, speaking to you with my voice. Keep your eyes peeled, men. That plane with the box is bound to come out later or sooner. [groans] They shall not pass. [Baloo chuckles] Wouldn't old Beckers pop her pearls if she knew we was going to Louie's? Yeah, but how is she ever gonna know? - What's so great about Louie's? - Molly! Lucy's not scared no more. How did you get here, button-nose? I hid in the mangoes. Oh, great. You shouldn't have come, little lady. Now I gotta take you back. Oh, please take me with you. I'll be real good. Sorry, but you're taking a one-way trip home. Well, OK. Mommy probably didn't want me to go to Louie's anyway. Louie's! You don't have to tell your Mom about Louie's. Oh, I won't... if you take me along. Why, you sneaky... You know something, pigtails, you think like me. I guess we're going to Louie's. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you! Captain Cunningham to navigator. Watch out for pirates. [Molly imitates machine gun] I thought Molly might like one of your world-famous Krakatoa specials. Oh, what's that? Why, just the most de-bopa-licious sundae you ever tasted. [Louie scats] Now, where's that old treasure? Follow me. Ooh-hoo! - I feel a fortune coming on. - Da-da! Well, pop my peepers. Oh! Sorry, Lucy, but there's not enough here for both of us. Psst! Louie. Could you give us a beat on this bauble? Like, what's it worth? Ooh! Aah! Yowza! - Yeah, yeah? How much is "Yowza"? - Yeah. In round numbers. - Nothing, coz. It's not a jewel. - Nothing?! Nada. Zero. Zip. Zilch. It's man-made, man. Aw, nuts! - [buzzing] - Ooh, pretty. I still don't get it though. If the rock's worthless, why did Karnage steal it from Shere Khan? Shere Khan? Is that a fact? Ow! [thudding] Maybe this nightlight is worth something after all. When we get back, we'll pay Mr. Khan a visit. Maybe there's reward moola. Hey, look. Birdies. [gunfire] Attack! Why do they keep chasing me? Here goes Becky's paint job. Quick, grab me some mangoes. Wow! Are they real pirates? Yup. And let's hope they're real hungry. Ha ha! Here's fruit in your eye! - Ha! - [gunshot] Nix that idea. - Got any rope, Baloo? - Huh? Yahoo! Where did he learn that? I don't know, but I want a go next. Ha ha! You want some dessert? [giggling] Uh-oh. I hate when that happens. Man, that kid is dynamite. [laughs] Whoa! - [gunfire] - Time to get in out of the rain. Don't look, Lucy. Boy, you are something else, kid. Thanks, but we're surrounded. How do we get outta here? Only one way left. He cannot make a fruit salad out of me! Follow him! Oh-oh. [all scream] You know, I lose more good cargoes that way. [Rebecca] I can't believe it. My plane ruined, my shipment destroyed. I've only been in business a day. - It was air pirates, I tell you. - Why would pirates want mangoes? - Vitamin C? - I don't believe this for a second. You're up to something, Baloo. But, Mommy, he's telling the truth. Molly! You took my daughter joyriding? You're never gonna see your plane again, buster! Oh, no, Mommy. Me and Lucy sneaked away. And then he dumped the fruit to save me from the pirates. I guess I owe you an apology, Baloo. And a thank-you. That still doesn't explain what happened to your uniforms. [Molly mimics airplane] Look out, you pirates, it's Danger Woman! Say, did you get clearance for that landing? [Molly giggles] - Time for bed, Molly. - I want to fly some more. Sorry, honey. Kit and Baloo have to sleep now too. Yes, short-stuff. Even aces need their shut-eye. Here. So my flight crew doesn't get chilly. Uh... Gee, thanks, Miss Cunningham. - 'Night. - Sleep tight. See you later, navigator. Ha ha! First thing tomorrow, we lay our surprise on old Shere Khan. Right, kid? Uh... Right, Baloo. [Karnage] ♪ O sole mio ♪ O so do you-o ♪ [deep voice] Who goes there? Good evening, officers. Scusi, signore. The young lovers, they need their privacy. Sì? Grazie. Now to find that plane. Aw, but there's a thousand of 'em parked in Cape Suzette, boss. Ha! Then we shall search every one until we find the box. I had a feeling you were gonna say that. Rise and shine, Lil' Britches. The early bird worms the best deal. Oh, yeah. Shere Khan. Ooh, I bet we get 200 bucks for this sparkler. You think it's smart just walking into his office with it? Say, you're right, Lil' Britches. - What ya doing? - Better leave it here. Don't wanna tip our hand too soon. [clattering] Kit? Baloo? [Karnage] Look! This is it. Cut the engine. [Baloo] So you see, Mr. Khan, sir, if we could get the stone back, what might it be worth to you? - Well, Mr. Balloon... - Uh, Baloo. Yes. That stone, as you call it, is an electrical alloy developed by my scientists. So that's why it zapped me. I'll make it worth your while to return it. What would you say to a hundred? Only a lousy hundred bucks? 100,000 lousy bucks. - Dollars? - Dollars? Sit tight, Shere baby, we'll be back before you can say "Sea Duck"! We did pretty good, huh? Ha-ha! 100,000 smackers. Oh-ho! Now I can buy my plane back and get outta here. Let's grab that sparkler and scoot. Baloo, look! The doll's gone! - Molly! Miss Cunningham! - Molly! Beckers! Where are you? Where'd you go? Oh, my gosh! [Kit] Where are you guys? Molly! - Where'd they go? - Baloo, up there. "Unless you return the stone, you will never see your friends again." "Seriously yours... Don Karnage." ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh Oh-oh oh-oh oh [Baloo] Ha ha ha! ♪ TaleSpin ♪
