 This time he's not getting away. [English accent] Blast. Time to find you a hiding place, my darling. Ah, just the thing. Drat! OK, Covington, hand it over! And let you cretins waste the wealth that talisman will bring? If you don't give us the doll, we're gonna waste you! Ah. Sweet deliverance. Who says the police are never around when you need them? Oo-oh! Oh, I beg your pardon, officers. Here you are, risking your lives to protect our community and I damage your motor car. I insist that you arrest me until I make reparations. Next time. Blast! This could take hours. What sort of slob would leave an airplane in such a state? [Kit] Baloo! - Hello? - Papa Bear. Miss Cunningham is gonna have a surprise inspection. Inspection? Yeah. She'll be here any minute. And you know what she said about, "A clean plane is..." "...an efficient plane." I know, I know. We'd better get moving, Kit, boy. Say, how did you find out about this inspection? Uh... I accidentally read it on her calendar. You mean the very private, "trespassers will be shot" calendar that she keeps locked in her desk? That's the one. [chuckles] I love that boy! [splash] Phew! That's the last of it. Let's get it out of here before Becky shows up. - Baloo! - It's her! Baloo? Oh, there you are. I'm seeing it and I still don't believe it. Baloo! Whoa there, Molly. What's with the get-up? I'm not Molly. I'm Danger Woman. Here to inspect my secret headquarters. It's the only way I could get her away from that silly radio program. Hey... What happened to all your neat garbage? Baloo, I have to admit that it looks like you're running a shipshape ship. Why, sure, Rebecca. Like you always say... A clean plane is an efficient plane. - You missed a piece. - Gee, how did that get there? Well? OK. - Got it. - Oh, boy! This is more like it. I thought the air-freight business would be full of adventure and romance. All I get is clutter and disorder. Where's the glamour? Where's the excitement? Don't worry, Mommy. There's always clamor and incitement when Danger Woman's on the job. Honey, I wouldn't trade you or Danger Woman for anything. But what I wouldn't give to meet someone with charm, with culture, a real man of the world. I beg your pardon, but I am looking for a Ms. Rebecca Cunningham. I... I'm Rebecca Cunningham. Ah, Rebecca. A name for royalty and it suits you so well, my dear. My name is Covington. - Oh, my! - Oh, brother! He sounds like the guys Danger Woman's always beating up. You must be Baloo, master of the world-famous Sea Duck. Ah, the tales I've been told. You have? Well, now. I have been through a scrape or two or three. Who is this darling little girl? And how did she get to be so cute? - You stay away from my mommy! - Ow! Molly! Be nice to Mr. Covington. He was just trying to say hello. [Baloo] I don't know what you heard about the Sea Duck, but there's not a plane in the sky like her. What's this? Wow! A doll. She'll look a hurricane in the eye and never blink. Oh, may I see that, my dear? No! Molly! It's my doll. I found it. - I can have it, can't I, Baloo? - Why, sure, honey. Oh, Mr. Covington, I don't know what has gotten into the child. Oh, it's forgotten. And, please, just call me Covington. We can't remain so formal if you and I and your delightful child and her little wooden playmate are to become good friends, can we? All right... Covington. Molly, I want to talk to you about Mr. Covington. You do realize that Covington has become very special to me? I know, Mommy, but Kara and Milly think he's creepy. They want me to be happy, don't they? For sure, Mommy, but... Oh. They'll try real hard to like Mr. Covington. Oh, thank you, honey. But I won't. Creepy isn't getting you or my mommy. Where is that wonderful child of yours tonight? [giggles] I talked Danger Woman into spending the evening with her dolls. Dolls? Indeed. How sweet. I should at least say hello to the little girl. Oh... Covington! Are you all right? - Quite frankly, I don't know. - Here, sit down. Look, his haircut fell off. - Molly! - Uh-oh. Young lady, we have to talk. That does it! I'm going to get that doll tonight. And I think I know just how to do it. Molly, what am I going to do with you? My dear! Baloo just called. There's been a robbery at your offices. Oh, my goodness. Covington, I... You know, Rebecca, that you can always count on me in a crisis. I shall remain here and protect your daughter. Oh, thank you, Covey. You're an angel. Mommy, please. We want to come with you. No. I've had enough of your shenanigans tonight. You'll be safe with Covington. Never fear. I'll have everything well in hand. As soon as you give me that doll. Now, are you going to let Covington see your doll or not? - Not! - Ow! Open up, you little brat, or I'll break it down! I'm sorry, Milly, but Kara has to run away. You two say goodbye while I figure out what to do. All right. You asked for it. Leaving without your baby-sitter's permission, my dear? Naughty, naughty. Now, give me that doll, you little wretch. It's worth millions. Millions? Mommy needs millions more than you. No, no, no. Not the shins. Oh! Don't be afraid, Kara. I'll take care... - Got you! - No! Drat! Oh... Ah! Just wait till I tell my mommy. Don't six-year-olds ever get tired? For the eighth time, Rebecca, we didn't call. - Honest, Miss Cunningham. - Something's not right. Come on. We'd better check this out. Mommy! Baloo! [Covington panting] Ah-ha! Molly! Covington! - Maybe they went to Higher For Hire. - Oh, I hope so. Shh. Now I have her. We have to be smart as Danger Woman. Just give Covey-wovey the doll and you can go home. [car approaches] Baloo, check the Duck and I'll check the office. Blast! No, you don't. [crash] - Did you hear something? - Uh-uh. Uh-oh. Ah! Ow! I hate that. Don't think it hasn't been fun, but this was intended for other hands than yours. Gentlemen. What an opportune arrival. Let me guess. You was just on your way to deliver the doll when we happened to bump into you. Yes. How very perceptive of you. Here it is, Arnold. The stuff that dreams are made of. Yeah. [doll] Mama! Wait! I know a sure-fire way to get that doll... ...with this one. Yes. And she's dressed like Danger Woman. I hope Molly's all right. That's right. Danger Woman! Like on the radio! - [door slams] - The Sea Duck! [crashing and smashing] I know you're here somewhere. At last! [Rebecca] Covington? I thought you were supposed to be baby-sitting. I... Oh... Well, I... Oh, Rebecca, darling, forgive me. Molly has been kidnapped. - Kidnapped? - Calm down, Baloo. I'll handle this. - Kidnapped?! - She's been taken to Skull Island. Until they get this doll. So let's give it to them. Come on. Oh, it's my fault she's gone. If only I wasn't allergic to pain! - I shall deliver it. - Now, hold it. Haven't you been sniffing around after this doll? I have no notion what you could mean. I feel responsible for Molly, that's all. Don't worry. We're all going. We'd never make you do this by yourself. Thank you so very much. - [thudding] - Oh! Ow! My shins! - Oh! Ow! - Oh! - Ow! Grab her! - Oh! You grab her! When I see Covington again, I'm gonna pop him like a balloon. - Why would anybody want this ugly doll? - Sentimental value? Covington, I don't know what's going on. All I want is to get Molly back safe, and soon. I got romance and adventure and may have lost my daughter in the process. - [thudding] - Ow! Ouch! Oh! Ow! Oh! Remind me to give up kidnapping. At least she don't weigh much. [Kit] There they are. - Here's the doll, Baloo. - Thanks. Here's what you want. Now, where's the girl? - Let's see it. - No. Molly first. Why not? Oops! Grab the doll! Mama! Hey, Covington, it's the wrong... Covington? Where is he? That dirty double-crosser must have pulled a switch. Never mind him. Where's Molly? You want the girl, we want Covington. I know where we'll probably find him. Come on. [snapping] It's old creepy and he's got Kara. I've done it. Riches beyond imagining. The treasure must be near. I can sense it. All I need is a... sign! [rumbling and whirring] I hope someone somewhere is enjoying all this. Oh, no more. Please, no more. I've got it. The largest ruby in the world. Oh, no one can stop me now. It's finally mine. It's my mommy's! Not you again! There's no way out, you little rug rat. - Hand over that dolly. - You can't have her! - You never loved my mommy! - Hah! Don't make me laugh. She was just an easy way to get to you and the doll. - Now, give it to me! - No! Easy way?! Why, you two-faced, thimble-headed, no-account... man! Uh... Rebecca, my peach. I was only thinking of you. Oh? What about your partners? Those hairy imbeciles? Oh, I could lose them in a phone booth. Hiya, "partner." Whoops! I-I-I didn't mean it, chaps. It was just a joke. Can't you take a joke? - The question is, can you take it? - Yeah! Too bad these things don't come with brains. Oh, Molly. Thank goodness you're safe. Ah, Mommy, you shouldn't have been scared. Danger Woman always wins. But I'm sorry you didn't get the millions. Yeah. And I'm sorry that Covington cat turned out so low-down and dog dirty. Thank you, Baloo. But I got what I wanted. And I found out you're all the adventure and romance I need. Yeah? Just wait till you tune in next week. Same Danger time, same Danger channel. [Rebecca chuckles] I wouldn't miss it for the world. ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh Oh-oh oh-oh oh [Baloo] Ha ha ha! ♪ TaleSpin ♪
