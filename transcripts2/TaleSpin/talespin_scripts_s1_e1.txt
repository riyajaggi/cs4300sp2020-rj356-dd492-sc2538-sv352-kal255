 Mayday, Mayday! This is Flight 127... Tut tut! Such manners. Shere Khan owns this plane, you slimy thief! - Let's get him! - [gulps] The box, if you please. What goes up must come down. Men, back to the Iron Vulture! At last. The key to my future! Ha ha! Riches, my men. Riches beyond your limited, insignificant dreams. But not beyond mine! For soon, I, Don Karnage, shall be the wealthiest man in the world! For me? Aw, you shouldn't have. Well, it was nothing really... Stop that boy! Don't just stand there. The captain needs your help. Get him, you idiots! What?! Well, my reckless reptile. Perhaps it is none of my business, but, uh... you've gotten yourself in a tiny piccolo. Yes, no? You know, you're right. It is none of your business. No! My treasure! After him! After him! [kid] Ah-ha! Breaker, breaker. Come in, Louie. Hey, has the party started yet? What was that? Wahoo! [laughs] - [laughter] - [music] Oh, man, Baloo. Sometimes running this place is like working in a zoo. Hey, Louie, you gotta learn my secret to relaxation. Oh? And what's that, coz? [music starts] Oh, yeah, man. He-hey. ♪ When life down here's a thunder cloud I take off for the air ♪ I soar above the madding crowd without a single care ♪ I'm not one to stick around when problems start to brew ♪ So see you later, navigator ♪ I know just what to do I'm gone - ♪ He's gonna fly - ♪ I'm gone ♪ Adios, bye-bye ♪ Don't trouble me with troubles, man I'm gone - ♪ Oh, he's gone - ♪ I am gone ♪ Oh, wait a minute - ♪ I'm gone - ♪ The sky's the limit ♪ I love to be above it all - ♪ I'm gone - ♪ Oh, he's gone - ♪ He's gone - ♪ Oh, yeah - ♪ He's gone - ♪ Lay it on me, Jack ♪ Don't trouble him with trouble, man He's gone - ♪ Ba do dap doobie done - ♪ He's gone - ♪ Check the wing, Bing - ♪ He's gone ♪ Hold the chock, Jock - ♪ He loves to be above it all - ♪ I'm gone ♪ Well, well, what have we here? Come here, you half-pint hitchhiker! Cut the kid some slack, Jack. - Yeah. Listen to the fat lady. - Lady?! Whatever. I didn't know he was a pal of yours, Baloo. No hard feelings, OK? Nice kid. That was quite an entrance, Lil' Britches. - Hey, you're a pilot. - Last I checked. - Are you good? - The best, kid. Numero uno. I'm gonna be a pilot some day. Yeah. Bet you will be too. Hey, nice luggage. - Hands off! It's mine! - Easy, kid. I'm just admiring. Well, see you in the funny papers. Look, I didn't... Oh, forget it. [crashing] I am sorry to fracture the festivities.... but I have a brief announcement. Get out of my place, Karnage. Ah-ah-ah! Now, I am looking for a boy who has stolen something from me. Hand him over and I will leave peacefully. If not... [gunshot] ♪ Doobie doobie doobie-di-doo ♪ Miss me, baby? That-a girl. Talk to me. You have made Don Karnage, which is me, very unhappy. Boys, tear the place asunder. Don't bother. I was just on my way out. Get him! It's been fun, guys, but I gotta be going. Yahoo! Oh, baby. That's my girl. [tapping] - Hello. - Hiya, kid. You need a lift? - Mm-hm! - OK by me. Though it's comfier inside. [kid] Oh, what a great plane. A Conwing L16, right? Good eye, kid. I call her the Sea Duck. My best friend. Customized her myself. Yeah. Like those engines. Superflight 100s, right? Hey, you're all right, kid. What do they call you? Kit. Kit Cloudkicker. Glad to meet you, Kit. - I'm gonna buy a plane one day. - I hope your folks are rich. I don't have any folks, but I'm gonna be rich and real soon too. Well, if you're gonna get a plane, you'd better know how to fly it. Me? Really? Knock yourself out. Wow! Hey, relax, Lil' Britches. Just hold her steady. That's it. Say, you're a dandy. Yeah, but I can't get my license for five more years. But when you do, you'll be a regular ace. - [gunfire] - What was that? Back on the corner where I hang out, we call that pirates. [Karnage] Do what you want to the plane, but I want the boy untouched. So I can tear him to little bite-sized pieces. - [gunfire] - [thunderclaps] What are they after me for? I don't have anything they want. Not necessarily. This is no time for a Chinese fire drill! Follow them! [Kit] Baloo! Boy, they're tougher to shake than ticks on a dog. We aren't gonna make it. Pull up! Pull up! Now, just hold on. Old Baloo's not out of tricks yet. [screaming] You... No one can fly like that. Great pilot. Great plane. I'll say. So what's next? - A quick exit. - But you can fly rings around them. Don't have to. That's Cape Suzette up ahead. But we'll never make it in time. - Those puffs of smoke say we will. - Huh? No! The Cape Suzette cannons. Oh, they make me so angry. [Karnage] Retreat! Retreat! But soon I will have the last ha-ha. After I get the boy and the box. Those bozos can never seem to get past the cliff guns. [laughs] Drives 'em crazy! [Baloo] Cape Suzette, kiddo. - What do ya think? - Wow! Ah, it's good to be back. Hey, the Sox won the series. That paper is two months old. Just like these unpaid bills. That's all detail stuff, kid. Me? I'm a big-picture kind of guy. No way to run an airline. Look, I only work when I have to and no more. Flying is what life's all about. In fact, I've been thinking of having a navigator. - Interested? - Me? Oh, no way. I gotta get back to Louie's place. Didn't we just leave there? Yeah. And I wanna go back, OK? This tough guy routine work on all your friends? I... don't have any friends. Look. Sorry, kid, but I'm not due back at Louie's for a few weeks. - [knocking] - But I have to go now. - Mr Baloo? - The one and only. I'm from the Cape Suzette National Bank. About your plane... [Baloo] Yeah. Ain't she a beauty? You, sir, are delinquent on your last six payments and unless funds totaling $3,000 are deposited in our fiduciary institution by 9:00am tomorrow, we will be forced to foreclose on your aircraft loan. You're gonna take my plane? You can't! That's my baby! We have sent numerous notices. Just like these unpaid bills. I thought those were sweepstake giveaways. Good day. But 3,000 smackers? No! What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do? Couldn't you take a job or something? A job? Kid, you're a genius. With a capital J. Ha ha! I'll just find a job here on the old job board. Can you really make $3,000 this fast? Yeah, if the job's nasty enough. Ah-ha! A zoo delivery. Wait. What exactly are we delivering? Well, they're sorta... big and mean... and ugly. - And smelly. - Oh, no! Not gorilla birds? - You see? Nothing to it. - Yeah. Right! It's a piece of cake. Get 'em outta here! They're eating my plane! [screaming] Phew! Close... - Hey! Whose side are you on? - Sorry. Just lock 'em up in the back. Is that too much to ask? Wait. You were the one who said this was gonna be a piece of cake. [gunfire] [Baloo] Looks like we're in for some icing. [Karnage] Get them, my men. Get them! Pirates again? What could these guys possibly want? Don't look at me. Hang on, Lil' Britches. Ha ha! Hey, my flying is A plus! Whoa! Yee-agh! Yeah, but your landings are C minus. [Karnage] Curses and more curses! They are down there somewhere. Find the boy. Got it? Yes, Captain. I'm sorry, baby. You OK? Phew! I think we lost 'em. Maybe. But it don't figure. I got nothing they want, but they attack us every time me and you... Wait a minute. You! They're after you! Talk to me, kid. What's with you and the pirates? - Look, what do you care? - They're shooting at my plane, son. Yeah. That's all that matters. Your plane, your plane. Where are you going? Oh, he'll be back... The birds! All he cares about is his plane. - I'll get a plane better than his. - [Karnage] Hello, my boy. Long time, no see. See? Here, birdy birdy birdies. - Come to old Baloo. - [sniffs] [squawking] Come here, you pillow stuffing. Still having trouble remembering where the box is, eh? Perhaps a night in the jungle will... jog your memory. There are numerous hungry animals in the jungle, you know, with sharp, pointed... teeth! You... You bit me! March, you overgrown feather dusters. Thanks to you, the Sea Duck is all mine. [Karnage] This is your last chance, boy. Is the box in the plane? Plane? What plane? I walked here. No use protecting your friend. We will find him. Oh, friend? I don't have any friends. - It's Kit. - [honking] Sshh! Quiet! OK. We'll do it the hard way. Dumptruck! Get me the turnips and the sandpaper. That kid's something else. I gotta save him. Oh, I'm gonna hate myself in the morning. Excellent. Now, my boy, I want some answers. Stuff it in your windsock! My windsock?! Why, you little...! [sniffing] What is that smell? - [honking] - [squawking] No time to be hanging around, kid. What is going on? What is going on? - Ah! - Oh! - Pull chocks? - Pull chocks. [both] Oh, no! But, Baloo, what about your birds? Hey, what's more important? Those burping buzzards or my new navigator? Where does he keep his spoons? - Baloo! - Now, remember... You be good to your new owner, like you were good to me. Make me proud. I'm... I'm sorry about your plane. Listen. Nobody's ever stood up for me before and... Well... I have a treasure. I'll share it with you. Oh, thanks, Lil' Britches, but I don't think your bottle-cap collection can help. No. It's a big, glowing jewel. Sure, kid. Why do you think the pirates are after me? - A jewel? You mean it? - I hid it at Louie's. I could buy back the Sea Duck! We can buy a whole bunch of Sea Ducks! How about we go get it first thing in the morning? You and me. I'm gone. Hey, we gotta fly. I'm gone. Adios, bye-bye.
