 Baloo? Shouldn't we be warming up the plane or something? The client said to be ready at midnight. Hey, Lil' Britches, don't get your engines in an uproar. Deadlines are for the birds. - [car engine] - [screeching tires] Get up! Up, up, up, up! - Hey, where's the fire? - Hurry. Get this to Cape Suzette by morning. No problem. It's a piece of cake. It's only midnight. - There's plenty of time... - Go, go, go, go. Step on it, snail-brain. Hey! You can't call my buddy that. Whoa! [siren wails] Oh, man. Some people sure are antsy in the pantsy. [Baloo] I wonder what that guy was so hopped up about. [rattling] Oh, well. What say we stop at Louie's for a burger and fries? - Baloo! - Wait a minute. My stomach says it's all right and whatever's OK by the big guy is all right by me. [Kit] Ask your stomach what Rebecca said the last time we were late. [Baloo] Relax. We've got till morning to make it back. Besides, it's just Louie's. We zip in, we eat, we zip out. It's not like we're gonna party till dawn. - [lively party music] - [cock crowing] [Baloo] Oh, no! It is dawn. - The little hand's on seven. - Oh, seven. - Big hand's on... - 13? - No, 12. - Oh, yeah. 12. - So he'll be here in one minute. - One minute. And he better not be late, lady, or the deal's kaput. - Kaput. - Boss likes everyone following orders. - Yeah. Following orders. - Following orders. [Baloo] Oh, we're not gonna make it. I'm gonna say we ran into a hurricane. Nah. You used that story last week. - Oh. How about a volcano? - Week before. - Cannibals? - Last Tuesday. Oh, baby, this is serious. I got it. We'll tell her we were attacked by air pirates. Oh, Baloo. You used that one yesterday. There we were, outnumbered a jillion to one, we were dodging and weaving and dodging. Oh, baby, what a fight. But it was my double-decker pretzel loop that did it. Baloo! No buts. Give me them bucks. - [plane approaches] - Wait. There he is. Yeah. He is. Air pirates. Oh, what a battle! We rocked 'em. We socked 'em. Sure, we're a little late, but, hey, we made it. Ta-da! Uh-oh. [henchman] Hey, where's the box? What happened to it? - It ain't here. - The boss is not gonna like this. [both] Wait till we tell him what you did. No, wait. We'll send out a plane for it. A boat. Uh... Nix, lady. - The boss had to have that box by noon. - Yeah. By noon. Well, Lil' Britches, it looks like I blew it. I guess it could have been worse. She could have yelled at me. It's worse. You clod! You nincompoop! Can't you follow simple instructions? Look, Becky, we were rushing to make it back... If you'd stayed on schedule you wouldn't have had to rush and you wouldn't have lost the box and then we wouldn't be out $10,000! Ten grand?! Yes. Ten grand. Oh, man. I've never lost my cargo before. Late, yeah, but always with my cargo. How am I ever gonna make up for this one? Swear off burgers and fries? Hey. I got it. - [door opens] - [coughing] Um... Ms. Cunningham? I just wanted to say that... Well... I goofed up royally and I'm... I'm sorry. And? And? Oh, yeah. And the next time, old Baloo's gonna follow your instructions to the letter. Glad to hear it. Ooh! What's this? Instructions for your next job. And this is to make sure you're on time for it. And just what is the next job? A sightseeing tour around the city. Gah! A tour? They're the worst! Oh, I like it though, I like it. Great idea, Becky. Good. Come here. Ow! Easy on the lobes, lady. [Becky] Everything you have to do is on the schedule. Just check off each item as you go. And while you're checking off, I'll be checking up on you. Check? Check. I'll be running some errands in the city. If I don't see this plane fly by those places at these times I'll check you off, buster. You land back at the dock exactly at noon. And, Baloo, I want to see smiles on the passengers' faces. No sweat, sweetheart. Baloo will leave 'em grinning. I'll follow your schedule to a T. If I didn't know better, I'd say we were doing a tour. No, Lil' Britches, you got it all wrong. This is gonna be fun. Schedule! Noon! Here! With smiles! Yeah. Gobs of fun. I can't wait. Hey, Baloo. Look what I found in Number Two engine, man. Wildcat, you did it! All right! Hey... That's great, man. Ha... What did I do? Now, these goons said their goon boss needed this goon box by noon. Well, we still got time. We can get Becky's ten grand back. Except we got a tour to finish by noon. Oh, yeah. Hmm. I guess I can't do both at the same time. Hey, no way, man. You'd have to be in two places at once. Maybe not. All you gotta do is watch the clock and stick to the schedule. Except you're gonna land early, at one minute to noon instead of noon. I get back in the plane and Rebecca will never know that I didn't fly the tour. Hey, what...? No, wait. Slow down. I'm flying the tour? Yes. Now, repeat after me. - Follow the schedule. - Follow the schedule. - Watch the clock. - Watch the clock. - Land at the dock. - Land at the dock. - Smiles. - Smiles. And follow the schedule. By George, I think he's got it. Uh, hello? Ahoy, there. One minute to 11, passengers arrive. Hey, what do you know? I'm getting the hang of this. [Baloo] Ta-ta, Captain. A beautiful tour. - Lester and I must be off. - Off our rockers. One husband? Check. One wife? Double check. Uh... "Good morning and welcome... uh... ...aboard Higher For Hire tours." "This is your captain... speaking." "We will be taking off in..." Whoa! Less than a minute. Better take your seats quick. Are you sure this is a good idea? No. It's a great idea. Remember... Smiles! - [engines start up] - Three, two and one... [yelling] [male voice] Extry! Extry! Read all about it. Kranjipoor Crown stolen! Huge reward! - Paper, mister? - No. Maybe tomorrow. Oh, baby, it's gonna be too easy. Baloo, I have a funny feeling about this. Trust me, Lil' Britches. All we gotta do is deliver the box, get the bucks and be back at Higher For Hire before noon. Hey, don't I know you? My, my. Solid as a rock. - Up here too. - [knocking] Ha ha! I take after my mother. Wait a minute. You're the pilot who lost the box. Eureka. We've struck brains. Bingo, bright boy. Which is why we want to see your boss. Well, the boss said he don't wanna see nobody. Nobody. - And we do what the boss says. - Yeah. We do... Yeah. [crashing] Maybe we're too smart for those guys. What we need is a stupid plan. Got a dime, partner? [alarm rings] Let's see what's next on the schedule. A little more... A little more... Ah, just right. It's time. I have sandwiches. Sandwiches? What kind of sandwiches? Huh? Oh! - Baloney. - Oh! Oh! [laughs] Oops! Wow. Where's my head? I forgot the potato salad. Bon appétit! [phone rings] [male voice] Hello? Big stupid goons? The boss wants to see you. The boss wants to see us. - Do you think he means now? - Yeah! Now! [rapid footsteps] [panting] See? Nothing to it. I told you everything would work out. [male voice] You sponge heads! For the last time, I didn't call youse. I got more important things to do. I gotta deliver a stolen Kranjipoor Crown by noon, only I ain't got one 'cause of some idiot pilot! Oh, no. [henchman] Don't worry. We took care of that pilot. Yeah. Every time he tried to get in, we gave him the boot. Yeah, the boot. Him and his box. He was here with the box and you morons let him go? [splutters] It's them! [elevator chimes] We've got to stop meeting like this. [clock strikes] 11:31. Fly past the Savoir Faire restaurant. Uh-oh. Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain. I would like to announce that we will be going fast now. [passengers scream] 11:31. Ten seconds, Baloo. If you're not here... Is that...? It is. He actually followed the instructions. - [breaking glass] - [screaming] [boss] So this is the idiot pilot. [chuckles] That's me. The idiot pilot. Here. Ten grand, like I promised. Ha ha! Gee, thanks. Well, will you look at the time? - We gotta be going. - Yeah. Love to stay and chat. [clears throat loudly] Aren't you forgetting something? Silly me. By the way. You didn't open that box, did you? What, and see the stolen crown inside? Nah. Well, maybe just a peek. [boss] OK, boys. Ready, aim... About face! Fire! - Aw, sorry, boss. - Sorry. - That was dumb. - It was dumb. - We was just following orders. - Yeah. Orders. Shut up! You don't listen to the kid, got it? - [both] Yup. - Ready, aim, fire. Don't listen to the kid. Don't listen to the pilot. Listen to me. When I say fire, you fire. Wait! [splutters] - But it was you this time. - Yeah. You this time. But you two... My box! After 'em! What's the plan? We get back to the plane, turn in the crown and get the reward. - It's a good plan, huh? - [thudding] All right. Find them. Don't worry, kid. They'll never think to look out here. [gunfire] Hey, boss. We found them. [Baloo] This way. We gotta get to the roof. Oh, no! Look at the time! [both yell] Get the box! Get the box! - I got it. - No, I got it. - I got it. - You got me. [Rebecca] Baloo! I'll strangle him. Then I'll fire him. Then I'll strangle him again! Land it now, you idiot! So I can strangle you! [Wildcat] Right on schedule. Boy, Ms. Cunningham's gonna be happy to see this. After 'em! - Right, boss. - Right. I gotta get me some new goons. - [Kit] Hey, we got away. - Yeah. Yeah. [Baloo] But not far enough. [both] Wait till I get my hands on that fat bear. [gunfire] [Wildcat]...and this is Cape Park, recreational playground of our fair city. And over on the right is... Hey, guys! Hi! - It's Wildcat! - We're saved! [both] Wildcat! - [Baloo] Over here! - [Kit] Wildcat! Oh, no. Hee hee! Sorry, Baloo. I can't land until 11:59 Gotta stick to the schedule. I can be back by 12:15 if you want. OK? OK! - The schedule! Beautiful schedule. - Huh? Hey! Short, squat and ugly! [Kit] Baloo! Hey, kid, trust me. Old Papa Bear's got a plan. - First, we gotta get them to chase us. - That part's working. Then we've got to let them catch us. That's a plan?! Look, I'll just swim home. No, no. It'll work great. - Let us out! - Oh, is it too stuffy in here? Oh, no! The schedule! Oh, it's stuck on the cam. [both scream] [male voice on radio] All units be advised. Twin-engined seaplane in area answering description of aircraft used in Kranjipoor Crown robbery. Hey! That's him. Baloo, are you sure about this? Got it figured to the second. [boss] Aha! Gotcha! Don't even think of moving. Who? Us? No. What's the use? You got us. Man, our goose is cooked. We're going down... Will you shut up already?! Now, hand over the box. Here it is. Finally. OK. Now, when I say fire... - Baloo! - Excuse me? - What is it now? - Do you have the time? - Yeah. It's a minute before noon. - Thank you. [Wildcat chuckles] 11:59 on the... - [ringing] - ...dot. Hi, guys. Did I do OK? Right on the button. Aw! Sorry, boss. - Baloo! - Becky. Just in time. Here's your money, honey, and I believe this is yours too. But how...? - [siren] - Oops! Excuse me, will you? And for you, one crown and a soggy gang of thieves, courtesy of Higher For Hire. Good work. Guess there's no doubt about who gets the reward. Nope. [Baloo] Rebecca! This ought to cover the damage you caused on your joyriding tour, which I hope had a happy ending. [both laugh hysterically] Take a gander. Smiles. I don't know how you did it, Baloo, but one of these days I'll figure out what really happened and when I do... - [ringing] - Time we got out of here, huh, kid? Baloo! You come back here! I'm not done yelling at you! Baloo! Baloo! Do you hear me? Baloo!
