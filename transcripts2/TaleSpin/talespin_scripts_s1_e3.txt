 In the meantime, I have an opening for a staff pilot. Baloo offered to return the stolen jewel to Shere Khan for a big reward. But Don Karnage wants the jewel back, so he kidnapped Rebecca and Molly. Molly! Ms. Cunningham! What will Baloo do now? How are we supposed to give Karnage the rock when he's got Molly and Molly's got the rock? Oh, this is all my fault. - What are you talking about? - Come on. We gotta save 'em. Look, kid. I'm all for saving Molly and even old Becky, but we don't know where they are. I do. Pirate Island. Huh? Nobody knows where that is. Once we've passed the cliffs, climb 160 south southeast. How do you know so much about the air pirates? Oh, you can tell old Baloo. Were you kidnapped by 'em? Was...? Was your dad a pirate? No. I was a pirate! You happy now? [door slams] Hold on, Lil' Britches. Aren't you supposed to be flying? Relax. I got her on autopilot. Now, you wanna take this from the top? I got no family, no home. I hooked up with Karnage's gang about a year ago. But I got sick of 'em. So when I saw that stone, I figured, "Hey, make your move." That's when I ran into you. Aw, forget about them, Lil' Britches. From now on, you're with me. Thanks, Papa Bear. Do you see anything? Just clouds. Relax. Get to the gun, quick! They're coming in too fast. Maybe I can lose them in the clouds. [chuckles] Here they come now. What?! Ah, the catch of the day. Hello, Khan cargo plane. It is I, the plundering wonder, Don Karnage! Prepare for boarding. Aw, looks like they dropped their props! [laughs] Ha ha! So nice of me to drop in. Check the cargo, Ratchet. Gold bars? No. Antiques? Nah. Jewelry? Ah-ah. Hey, Captain. We hit the jackpot. Look. Fishbowls! But... they're worthless. You know, worth is in the eye of me who is doing the beholding. Well, victim persons, I must be off. So many crimes, so little time. Clear the area, men. Open the bomb bay doors, please, Hal. - No! - Don't you have any decency? I am a pirate. I don't do decency. Aaargh! [Karnage] April Foolishness. Why'd you let 'em live, boss? Because I want them to tell Shere Khan what we took. - Let him worry. - Oh. Now I see. Let us away, my fetid friends. Set a course for our most secretive hideout. [Kit] There it is. Pirate Island. - What, behind the volcano? - No. In the volcano. Whoo-hoo! Hot stuff. We'll use the back door. Now, come in low and fly through that fog bank. That's solid rock down there. Trust me. Whoo! That was some ride, kid. This way. - Nobody home? - Maybe there's out on a heist. Well, then, let's go find the girls. - Whoa! The whole place is rigged. - Rigged? Watch. [Baloo whistles] - Huh? - Shh! Hey, what about the traps? Everybody, hoe down! Well, swing to the left and swing to the right. Do-si-do all day and night. Back and forth and round about. Then you knock your partner out! - Slap me some skin. - Yeah! - Mommy, I don't like this place. - I know, sweetie. - Neither does Lucy. - Shh! Someone's coming. Food time. Well, hello, heartbreaker. Me? Of course you. Tell me... Why isn't a sharp cookie like you out with the rest of the pirates? Flying among the clouds, free as a bird, rampaging and pillaging. Oh, me just lowly prison guard. No plane. Well, we can fix that. You let us out and I'll give you the deed to my plane. You mean it? OK. Me get the keys. Um... Don't go away. ♪ Doo-dee doo-dee do... ♪ Ow! Sweet dreams, cement-head. Hey, the pink slip to the Sea Duck. Mm-mm. Becky, you briber. When I knock him down, Molly, run like crazy. Check. Say, Becky, guess who? Oh! That'll teach that goon to call me... ...Becky?! Baloo? What are you doing here? Uh, saving you... I think. [alarm buzzes] [Becky] What is that? Karnage is back. We gotta get. Wait! My pink slip! Relax, Beckers, it's back where it belongs. But... [Baloo] This way. [Kit] Too late. Duck. [Molly] Now we'll never get outta here. Quick! Before they see us. All right. Ratchet, take those goodies to the workshop and... ...do shop work on them. Excellemundo. Another profitable looting escapade. Yes? No? Well, a thousand groveling pardons, Captain, but could we just ask you one little question? Speak up. My door is always open sometimes. Oh! Well... Lately, we've been skipping the valuables and swiping flagpoles and wire and fishbowls and stuff... Yes, yes. What is your pathetic, insignificant little point? Well, what's all this junk for? Yeah. We don't understand. That is why I am in charge and you are bit players! Oh, did I hurt your feelings? Good. This is all part of my master plan. - Do you not see? - [all] No. Very well then. I shall just have to show you. Voilà! [pirates gasp] Lovely, isn't it? Come, come, come. Take a closer-up look. We can get out through there. [Becky] Oh, great! Wait. I'm getting a brainstorm. And me without my umbrella. Thanks to our mechanical genius, Ratchet, and his copy of "Do It Yourself Electronics", we will soon have a handy device that will get us into Cape Suzette. Fabulous! Uh... Are we going to rob it? No, no, no. We are going to plunder it! - Uh, but wait... Aren't we robbers? - No. We are not robbers, we are pirates. Pirates! Pirates! How often do I have to remind you?

Baloo... Ah! The round furry pilot and the annoying businesslady. Wasn't she locked up? [whispers] Well, of course she must have escaped! Never mind. I hope you brought my stone. I need it to complete my plans. - Stone? You seen any stone, Becky? - What stone? Do not be the clever guy with me. You are not qualified. Wait... Where is the boy? Go fish. You would risk your lives protecting that filthy flea? Hey, lay off. He's a good kid. Hiya, gang! I'm back. Kit, what are you doing? - Can it, rudder-rump. - Rudder-rump? Yo, Captain. How'd I do? What are you talking about, you juvenile delinquenty wink? I'm talking about what you taught me. The old Karnage hustle. First, I pretended to steal the stone from you, so I could finagle some ransom money out of Shere Khan. [Karnage] What ransom money? - $100,000. - Really? Ooh! Then I was gonna steal the rock back and give everything to you. That is until these clowns messed it up by grabbing the lady and kid. You ear picking ignorama-mouses! I ought to hang you by your pinkies! - Sorry. - Relax, Captain. I bamboozled this bozo into bringing me back. Kit... I thought we were pals. Yes. I thought you were pals too. Nah. I was just using the poor jerk to get me the stone. [laughs] He fell for it! [laughs] Very, very good. I like that. Then you will not mind if I blast them? Ready... Aim! Wait! Aren't you forgetting something important? You're hurting Lucy! - Aw, shut up! - Mommy! Ooh, he is even mean to children. So what do you think of my plan? Son, you are a refreshing addition to my normally thick-headed group. Now, how about we let these saps go, huh? Do not be silly. I never let anybody go. Then eat my gold dust! [noisy shouting] Shoot them... a lot! Perforate them, you pinheads! Run! Uh-oh. Trouble. [pirates clamor] - Worse trouble! - Oh... Oh, oh, oh! What about Kit? I can't shake these guys. I hoped I'd never have to use this. Hang on tight. Aaagh! Five... four... three... two... one... What was that? Something I added. Use it too long and the engines overheat and boom, boom, bye-bye. - Baloo? - Yeah? Let's do it again! Ah, so here you are. There. You are back with the pirates now. Yes? No? You did well, my puny protégé. Happy? Yeah. Couldn't be happier. What is with you? You haven't said three words the whole flight home. - Baloo? - [car approaches] - Oh! - Ah! Ah, so glad you could stop by. There are rules about this sort of thing. I make my own rules. Where's the stone? Before we say anything, what is this stone everybody keeps talking about? Fair enough. Doctor. Ahem. The stone is actually a sub-electron amplifier, which means it can create unlimited amounts of electricity. Enough to run all of Mr Khan's businesses. But we were only able to create one stone and it... Thank you, Doctor. Now where is it? Um... We don't have it. Don Karnage does. I am displeased, Baloo. You have let me down. Don't tell me about being let down, mister, 'cause I'm an expert. You let someone get close to you and they stab you in the back. Well, I'm sick of being used and I'm sick of working for you. and I'm sick of your stupid stone. So you all just leave me alone! Hmm. A very emotional man. You're all dismissed. - But, Mr Khan... - Good day. Baloo, where are you going? I'm outta here, sister. Maybe I'll try Louie's for a bit. - But that's my plane. - Uh-uh. I own it now. And just to make it all fair and square, this gold oughta cover it. Don't go, Baloo. Sorry, cupcake, but the sky's calling and I'm gone. This isn't about the plane or the stone or even me, it's Kit. What are you, the pirate den mother?! Baloo, I know it looks like he's betrayed us, but think with your heart, not with your head. Forget it. From now on, I fly solo. I just don't believe Kit's gone bad! ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ TaleSpin ♪ Ooh-ooh ♪ Another tale to spin ♪ Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh-oh Oh-oh oh-oh oh [Baloo] Ha ha ha! ♪ TaleSpin ♪
