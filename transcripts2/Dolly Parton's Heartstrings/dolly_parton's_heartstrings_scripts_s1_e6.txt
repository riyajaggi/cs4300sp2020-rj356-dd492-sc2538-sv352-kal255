 I always dreamed of bringing my songs to life and sharing them with you here at Dollywood. And if you know me, you know some of my very favorite songs are love songs. They always tell the best stories, and in 2002, I wrote a song about a place so wonderful that it captured decades worth of memories. Now, it's about a special young couple in love, who were destined to be together forever. Now, I've been lucky enough to be with the man I love for over 50 years, and I'm excited to share this beautiful story

 about a couple looking back on their journey together realizing that their love is a love for the ages, and it all started in a magical little place called Sugar Hill. She did great. Hit a wall at the end, though. I think we all did. I'll see you inside. That was an amazing eulogy, Daddy. I know it wasn't easy. Get home safe. It's late. You good on gas? I'm fine. I'm worried about you.

 I'm good. Avoid 10th Street, there's all that construction. Maybe dinner Friday? Maybe. I love you, Daddy. Okay, give me a half-hour to get home and look at it. I think he's worth it, and he's only going to get better as he matures. That could work. We'll talk in a bit. - How's that trade lookin'? - Like it's gonna happen. If they throw in the Colby kid, we got a deal. Batted .357 in Triple-A. I need to be in the office early tomorrow. I'll try to get in around noon. Dad, take a few days. Player Operations will survive without you. Besides... a little peace and quiet around the office would be a welcome change. Take that. We'll talk tomorrow. I'll call you if I hear anything. The kids really wanna be there for you. I know. It was a beautiful service. Everything about it. He was dealt a rough hand. I never understood how much he suffered. Until today. Hmm. I've got an idea. And you know how good my ideas are. What's that? Road trip. Oh, no, no, no, no, honey, I can't... Yes, you can. Sitting around here is only gonna make the grieving that much harder. Come on. Let's get out of here.

Is your daddy really a bad man? My mama says he is. Been saying it all summer. That's why she don't want me playing with ya. He ever kill anybody? Not that I know. Then how come nobody likes him? Uh, I like him. Hmm. Harper? Harper! Quick, hide. You know you're not supposed to be up this far. - Wait till Mama hears. - You don't got to tell her. - Who are you up here with? - Nobody. Is it that Logan kid? Hey, little turd, you up here? - I just told you. - You better not be lying to me. Bet you can't catch me, slow poke.

Put your fingers close together, right along that seam. That right there is a curveball. Are... Are you a bad man? Who said that? Somebody say something to you? No. You do what you gotta do in this world to get by. Now, sometimes folk, they don't get that. But it don't make you bad. You're really too young to understand what I'm talking about. But you will one day. So, you got a girlfriend? No. Was Mama your girlfriend? Get your thumb underneath those fingers. - Wh... What are we doing? - Hush up now. Shh. Oh, hell! Daddy! Get out of the car! - Hands! - Come on! Come on! Out of the car now!

We haven't been back home in a while. I think the last time, Emma was still in braces. She'd have a whole new appreciation of it. It's not her thing, honey. - Why would you say that? - It's not her thing. Of course it is. There is so much about Sugar Hill she doesn't know. Whatever. All I'm saying, a little father/daughter time would be good for both of you. - Are we gonna stop at your dad's place? - I don't know yet. Maybe. Okay. No rush. Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Harper, are you watching this? Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Yes. Oh, we have a winner. My brother's greatest talent. One of my many. Oh, yeah? What else you good at? Shut up. Yeah, that was good right there. Woo! What are you waiting for? Woo! - Who are those guys? - Baseball team from Campbell Valley High. Who's that? That's Logan. The boy who's mom died when he was born. I know who he is. We used to play together. I thought he moved away to live with his grandma. He did, until his daddy got out of prison. My uncle gave his old man a job at the lumber yard, fired him two weeks later. That boy comes from a world of trouble. - Where's the Frisbee? - I think it's... Wait, I left it in the car. I'll be right back. - Where you going? - Potty break. Can I have a beer? Careful... there are toads in that there pond. So long as I don't have to kiss one. So... you're back. Yep. Yeah, a few months now. I heard your dad got released. - How's he doing? - Okay. I always wondered what happened to you. - Yeah? - Yeah. You broke my heart when you disappeared. It wasn't by choice. Those were good times. Two little kids, not a care in the world. Hmm. And here we are. Back on Sugar Hill. You turned out pretty good. Well, I mean, uh, you know, not that you... Sorry, that was a stupid thing to say. I take it as a compliment. You're beautiful. That's what I meant to say. You didn't turn out half bad either. For a scrawny little kid. That your, uh, boyfriend? Oh, my God, no. No, that's Monroe. My brother. You're kidding? Damn. All I remember is him wanting to kick my ass every time he saw me. - You broke his nose with a baseball. - I was six years old! Hey, Harper, we're leaving. Let's go! I don't know if you got plans tonight, but there's a dance in town, - sort of a local thing. - You asking me on a date? I'm informing you of a social event where you might get the opportunity to share a dance with me. Hmm. Well, you might not be able to keep up. Only one way to find out. Hey, Monroe, remember me? Woo-hoo! - You son of a bitch! - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. ♪ Well, we made all the hot spots ♪ ♪ My money flowed like wine ♪ ♪ Then the lowdown southern whiskey ♪ ♪ Began to fog my mind ♪ ♪ I don't remember church bells ♪ ♪ Or the money I put down ♪ ♪ On the white picket fence And boardwalk ♪ ♪ On the house on the edge of town ♪ ♪ Oh, but boy do I remember ♪ ♪ The strain of her refrain ♪ ♪ The nights we spent together ♪ ♪ And the way she called my name ♪ ♪ Down in Dixieland ♪ All right, folks, we're gonna take a quick break now.

You serious? Knoxville's clog dancing champion three years in a row. She told me dancing might come in handy if I met the right girl. Oh, really? She teach you this? ♪ My mind and my heads all for you ♪ Uh-oh! - What's he doing here? - He's itching for a beatin', that's what. What? Come on. Where are we going? - I do not know. Quick this way. Come on. - Okay. I got an idea. Okay. Come on, come on, come on. - Wait, get in quick. - Okay. - Get down! Get down! - Damn it. - You are crazy, you know that? - Come on, come on. Are you sure? I... I think he went that way. Come on, come on, come on, come on. - This isn't your car? - Uh, it's a loaner. - Oh, my God. - Don't worry I got it. - Hey, that's him. - Go, go, go, go! Yee-haw!

I want you to sit right here. Now... close your eyes and stay real still. Now just listen. You hear that? It's beautiful. Yeah. Beautiful. During the day this place may be ours, but at night... at night it belongs to them. I used to come up here at night when I was a kid. It made me feel safe. I didn't know that. Your daddy would let you? - Even when you were that little? - He never even knew. I give you this. Best gift I've gotten in a long time. So what else do you do? Besides crash dances and steal trucks? Uh, baseball, that's my ticket. I heard you were pretty good. You think I didn't ask around after I ran into you this afternoon? Yeah, my high school team's okay. I got a good coach, got me seen by a few scouts. I know it's a long shot, but, eh, it's what I love. Tell me what you love about it. Um... When I'm on the mound pitching, I go to this place in my head where it's like... it's not even me anymore. Like I'm not in control. I throw harder and faster, and... and it's just so peaceful. Does that make any sense? Mm-hmm. Sounds like it's what you were born to do. What about you? What you dream about? Nothing, really. - Gonna be looking at colleges next year. - Oh, no, what you mean nothing? I just... I just bared my soul. It sounds stupid, but... I think I want to be a poet. There is nothing stupid about that. The world could use more poets. I read this book last year called I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. It was so powerful. Not that I'll ever be that good, but... I want to see if I can... reach down deep inside like that... tell the truth the way that she does. Then you will. That's the first time I ever said that out loud. What are you doing? - I don't know. - Oh, my God! What are you doing? You're insane. I knew it, you're insane. I'm not insane, I'm just trying to have fun. Oh, my God, you're crazy. Is it cold? Woo! Harper, you gotta come in, it's so warm. It is warm. It's so... It's like a bath. Come on. Here I come. Oh, my God. It isn't hot. It is cold. You're a liar. If I'd told you it was cold, you wouldn't have come in. Harper? Gotcha! - Oh, you're gonna pay tax on that. - Gotcha. - Come here, girl. - You can't get me. ♪ Sug, Sug, Sug Sugar Hill sugar ♪ ♪ Sweeter than candy and cakes and pies ♪ ♪ Up on Sugar Hill we'd go walkin' ♪ ♪ Hand in hand up the mountainside ♪ ♪ Teenage lovers plannin' and talkin' ♪ I ought to get you back to the dance. Not yet. You sure? ♪ Sug, Sug, Sug Sugar Hill memories ♪ ♪ Sweeter than ice cream and soda pop ♪ - Where you been at, boy? - Uh... The team went out after practice. Sorry, I... I should've called. How'd it go at the Super Mart? Ah... They don't want no ex-con bagging groceries. Maybe you should pull back on the drinking, Dad. What you just say to me? Think you some big shot now, huh? Telling your old man what to do. I'm goin' to bed. Don't you walk away when I'm talkin' to you. As long as you live in this house, my house, you will show some respect. - Yes, sir. - You think you got where you did on your own? Huh? Who do you think took you to baseball games while you were still pissing in your britches, hmm? Who taught you even how to throw a curveball? I'm talking to you! You answer me now, boy. You did. You're damn right I did. All by myself. You wouldn't be nothing without me. Nothing. Don't you ever forget that. Oof, I swear those are the same cakes from 45 years ago. I can't believe you brought me back here. Best hush puppies and honey butter on the Appalachian Trail. Don't give me that look. Oh, like you were going to drive by without getting some? Who is it? Luke. Probably just wanted to let me know what's going on with the trade. Maybe he just wanted to see if you were doing all right, too. I'll call him later. How many times are we going to go down this same path? Every time you're in pain, you shut down. You push away the people that you need the most, including your own kids. - It's a bad habit, Logan. - Stop, stop. Enough. - I don't need to hear this right now. - Yes, you do. - This was a mistake. - Oh, you want to go home? Is that what you wanna do? Let's just get back in the car and turn around. The whole point of being here was to let some of this go, 'cause if you don't, you're gonna end up a bitter old man, just like your father. Logan, talk to me. What do you want? You want me to say I'm angry? Yeah, I'm angry. And I have a right to be. Good. Be angry. That is the first honest thing that you have said to me since we left. You want to harp on the bad times? Do it. Because I'm here to remember the good times, and there were plenty of 'em. So, when you're done with this anger, you let me know. No. No, no, no. Don't... Don't... Don't go anywhere. Look, you were right about one thing. Hmm? I had no intention of driving by without gettin' some of those hush puppies. Oh, I know that this isn't easy. I know. Strike! Let's go, Valley! Let's go. Do it! Go, Lo! Batter, hey, batter. Swing, batter! Let's go, blue! Can't catch up to it. Come on, Logan! Strike three! I'm gonna marry that boy. Settle down. Hit the ball. You can't hit the ball if you're dancing. Settle down. Keep your eye on the ball. Ooh! One more, one more. Eye on the ball. Harper. Okay, sorry. Hey, batter, batter! I'm ready now. Run! Okay. Wait. Goddammit, Harper, you're going the wrong way! - No. Get away from me. - No, come on. Come here. - You're going the wrong way. - No, get off... That is it, I've had enough. How the hell can I love someone who doesn't understand the fundamentals of baseball? Did you just say that you loved me? Let's go eat. Say it again. I love you Harper Benning. Mr. Cantrell? Logan Cantrell? I'm Logan Cantrell. Pleased to meet you. I'm Calvin Butler, scout for the Montreal Expos. You got one hell of an arm. I'd like to talk to you about playing for one of our minor league affiliates, the Memphis Blues. Is this a good time? Hell, yeah. I mean, yes, sir. All right. Meet you later at the diner? Nine o'clock? Wait a sec. Dad, you here? A scout was at the game tonight, offered me a contract with the Memphis Blues. Their camp starts tomorrow. Where are my keys? Hmm? Did you hear me? I've got to let 'em know so they can add me to the roster. You ain't going nowhere. Now, where's my damn keys? They're right here. Where are you goin'? Ain't none of your business. You're too drunk to drive. You don't tell me what I do. Now, you give me my goddamn keys. Stop it. Get the hell off of me! You are on parole. Now, you get pulled over, you are going back to jail. - I gotta make a run. - Those days are over, Dad. I got in with the wrong people. I got a trunk full of liquor outside that I need to deliver tonight. If I don't... I'm in trouble, son. I'm in big trouble. I'll make the run. But that is the last thing I am ever doing for you. You see my basement, and, like, how it's, like, set up and there's, like, random stuff everywhere. - Yeah, right. - And there was, like, a fishbowl there. - Why was there a fish bowl there? - And I'm wearing my mama's heels, I don't know, but I step in the fishbowl and there was blood everywhere... Hello, ladies. - It's the fishbowl story? - Yeah. - I love that one. - I don't love that one. I'm waiting for Logan, but you can plant yourself till he gets here. I wouldn't count on him any time too soon. What's that supposed to mean? We just saw him driving his dad's car out Route 40. Heading to the state line, probably on a run for his old man. That is not true. Oh, come on, you don't think his old man's selling hooch again? Logan is nothing like his dad. What do they say, the apple don't fall far from the tree, is that right? I've known Logan since he was a little kid. He's got more goodness in his heart than you will ever know. Then where is he? Excuse me. Don't... Don't... Don't be mad. Just stay. - You're such an asshole. - Just stay a little longer. Oh, I miss you. - Don't be mean to her. - Ooh. Hmm. She's your sister. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. We'll take you home, okay? Sorry, I completely lost track of time. Where were you? I fell asleep at the house. The game wiped me out. I called your house three times. - What do you want me to say? - How about the truth. Hey, I'm... I'm gonna wait in the car, okay. Harper, don't do this tonight. I'm leaving for baseball camp first thing in the morning. Wow. Good to know. And this is how you want me to remember you? Standing here lying to me? - You wouldn't understand. - Try me. - Harper, I'm not going to go into it... - Were you out celebrating? Joyriding around in your dad's car? - I don't have time for this. - I know what you were doing, Logan. - I'm not stupid. - You don't know what the hell - you're talking about. - Just tell me why. No, I'm not just gonna stand here arguing with you right now, okay? I will tell you why. Because what everybody said about you is right. You are... you are just like your father. Is that what you think? Go on, go. Go to your stupid baseball camp. - You think that I care? - What are you doing? - I trusted you. I stood by you. - What are you doing, Harper? Stop. - Why are you... - Hey! Get your hands off my sister. Monroe, I didn't do anything. - Stop it. - Hey, Monroe, come on. - Come on. - Monroe, he's not worth it. - Stop. - Stop it! No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Harper. Harper. - I didn't mean to do that. I'm sorry. - I never want to see you again. - Don't touch me. - Come on. No, let me go. Harper! Look at me. Look at me, Logan. I'm gonna kill you, man. - Get off me. Get off of me. - Come on. Stop. Knock it off. Let's get out of here. It's okay. And if he doesn't get better? Well, if we're talking surgery, that's another story. So what are you thinking? It's gonna happen in the off-season? Luke, you there? What? Yeah, I'm... I'm here. Show me what you got, old man. Strike! Oh, how I loved watching you play. If I'd have known then what I know now... What would you have done differently? A lot of things. Then again... maybe nothing at all. Well, if you could change one thing... what would it be? I... I... I don't know. I'm giving you a mulligan. I mean, do... do they have mulligans in baseball? How the hell could I love someone who doesn't understand the fundamentals of baseball? All right, then, I'm gonna give you one more time at bat. What would it be? I'd have to say, all the games I played, all those years grinding it out, even being on the other side of it now, it just doesn't seem that important. Made you who you are. I know, I get that, but if I could go back, that's the one thing I'd want to know. That it was just a game. To have fun with it. And I'm not talking about baseball. I'm talking about life. I've always had this feeling that there was somebody looking after us, you know? Even in our hardest times. You talking about God? Fate? I'm still trying to figure it out. All I know... I couldn't get rid of you. Oh, hey, ladies. Where you going? The bar's this way. I am married. Oh, you're married? What do you know, me too. Logan, come on, man. Let's go. I'll catch up with you guys. Hey, first round's on me. Let's go, man. Flew, flew, flew in my nights Flights of illusion, glittering deaths Red with breath, gold with light In spread of his wings Down, down, down did I fall Empty of life, crying in love Red with breath, gold with light This next poem is one... A... Actually, I'm... I'm gonna go a little off script here. I'm gonna read you the poem that inspired the book. I wrote it a very long time ago... for someone who is very dear to me. It's called Sugar Hill. Up on Sugar Hill we'd go walking Hand in hand while the south wind blowed Bobwhites calling, black crows cawking Counting the warts on a toad in the road Down in the mill pond swimming naked Showing more than we should have showed We were just kids We were just kids Thank you all for coming. Could you sign this, please? Pretty lousy poet. Can't even get through my own work without blubbering. You did it. You followed your dream It's really good to see you, Logan. Been a while. Almost five years. Uh, congratulations. Yeah. Life has taken a pretty big turn for me. Hmm. You got time for a cup of coffee? Hell, yeah. He was a grad student. Things got a little carried away one night. It wasn't planned, but I'm happy. Well, you're going to be a great mom. And that grad student's a lucky guy. It's just me. As soon as I told him, he didn't want anything to do with me. Or the baby. Wow, that must've been rough. It's for the better, really. No point in following one mistake with another. What about you? When am I going to see you playing on TV? Well, Lord knows I'm trying to get out of the minors. I've had some good outings. Games are fun, but, uh, bus rides... brutal. Well, it's gonna happen. And when it does, I'm going to buy a whole deck of your playing cards. Wouldn't that be sweet? You ever get back up the Sugar Hill? Nothing to go back for. - Do you still talk to your dad? - I had to get away from all that. How come you never called me? Well, based on how we left things, I... I didn't think you wanted me to. I regret that night. Everything about it. I was too... young and stupid to know that you'd understand what I was going through. We both had some growing up to do. Closing up, Harper. I did not realize how late it was getting. Can I walk you out? You go ahead. I got to get some stuff from the back. Well... Well... Good luck with the baby. Thanks. Good luck with the team. I'll have to come to a game next time you're in town. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be nice. I'll be sure to get you a good seat. It was really great seeing you, Logan. No. No. Harper! Harper! Oh, my God, Logan. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. Not even a little. What the hell were you doin'? I was coming back to tell you that you are the only person I've ever been able to talk to. About anything. And I miss that. I miss you. And I was walking past this coffee shop tonight for a reason. Now, you can call it fate or... or God, or whatever you want. And my biggest regret is walking away from you that night outside the diner. And I'm not walking away from you again. Unless you tell me to. I'm... I'm having another man's baby. And I don't care. What are you saying? I'm saying that I don't want us to be apart. Not for another minute. Logan... Come on the road with me. It'll be crappy hotels and lousy food and sleepless nights, but we will be together, and that's what matters. And you can keep writing and publishing your books, whatever you want. We can raise your baby together. So what do you say? Marry me? It's not too late to change your mind. Not a chance. And, since we're doing this... We weren't going to buy rings till we could afford them. It was my mom's. And I didn't know her, but I got a feeling she'd be proud of me right now. That is so sweet. Come here, you little turd. Congratulations, man. No. No. No one said anything about this. Should we get started? We gather here today before a sovereign God to witness the joining of these two souls in holy matrimony. Oh... that does not look good. Oh, damn. Well, looks like it's time to get dirty. Could do that... or... - Don't even go there. - What happened to making it all a game? I ain't going home to that woman there. You're the Devil. Ain't that what you love about me? A little... little bit. A little bit. ♪ Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill memories ♪ ♪ Stealing sugar on the mountainside ♪ ♪ Sug, Sug, Sug, Sugar Hill sugar ♪ ♪ Sweeter than ice cream and soda pop ♪ - Woman scares the hell out of me. - Well, she's your sister.

How come y'all keep sending them? What are you doin' here? I just wanted to see you, Dad. Well, I'm still kicking, if that's what you're wonderin'. I never saw this one before. Where'd you get it? Had it. Got a few more, too. Oh, she sure was beautiful. - She never liked having her picture took. - Really? Yeah. Get all ornery if anybody tried. How come you never told me more stories about her? You didn't know her. No. I didn't. Did you blame me? What happened didn't have anything to do with you. I've never blamed you for her dying. I know I wasn't a very good father to you. I should've known better. Well, you didn't have anyone to talk to. I mean, I understand that now. I got some cleaning I need to do out back. I'll let you go. Do you need anything, Dad? - I got an empty guesthouse any time... - I got everything I need right here. Well, you got my number if you ever change your mind, Dad. Good to see you, Dad. I...

You... you want to marry me again? Forty years ago... we stood right here... and you made me a promise and you've never wavered. Happiest day of my life. Hmm. Do you remember the words you said? - No. No. - Sure you do. - Harper, I don't... I don't wanna do this. - Come on, old man. Let me hear that promise one more time. I could promise... I could promise you my heart, but it's belonged to you since the day I first saw you. I could promise to cherish you forever. but the truth is I wouldn't know how to do anything but that. So I'll just promise to be the best husband I know how. To be by your side... until God takes us home. I can't do this. - Yes. - No, I can't. - I can't do it. No. - Yes, you can. You have been through tough times before. But you were there. And I always will be. It only hurts now... because there has been so much joy. In your heart, I found a home. In your arms, I found peace. I stand here in the presence of a love I don't deserve, praying for the courage to be worthy of that gift.
