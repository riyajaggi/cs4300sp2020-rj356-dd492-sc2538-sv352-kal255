 It is so special to me that I get to have a beautiful place like Dollywood where I get to play dress-up or wander through all this memorabilia from my life and my career, and this old stack of letters is from an episode of Heartstrings that you're about to watch. You see, back in the late '60s I wrote a song called "Down From Dover." Now, it's about a young girl who gets pregnant out of wedlock and has to deal with the struggles of the time as she hopes her fella will return to her. Of course, back when I first recorded it, it caused a lot of fuss, because it was such a controversial subject back then.

 But it was an important message for me to share, and eventually it became one of my most important songs. Now, the message here is that hope and love are the greatest forces there are. And if you have hope you can survive prejudice, you can survive separation, you could even survive unspeakable loss. I am pleased to present to you "Down From Dover." ♪ From Dover ♪ Look here, everyone. ♪ Dover ♪ Presenting proudly the Tecumseh High Class of 1967. Go forth, Warriors. Well done. Congratulations.

 Your parents must be so proud. I'm so glad you could be here, Grammie. Of course I'm here, baby. Stupid chair and all. Now go on, be with your friends. I'll be right here. I'll be back. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Dee? Dee? Wherefore art thou Lincoln Dollarhyde? Sorry it took me so long. - My... My Grammie. I had to... - I know. No one saw you? No one. I worry. You worry. Aren't you gonna kiss me? I have something to tell you. Well, you have all summer to tell me everything. This can't wait. Don't get serious on me. I am serious. Don't I know it. What is it? First... this is for you, Dee Covern. Wait, wait. It's your graduation, I got you something. Uh, Miss Cunningham. Congratulations, Lincoln. I'm proud of you. Graduating with honors. And I will see you next year, Dee. - Miss Cunningham, we were just... - I see nothing. I did it. Did what? I'm not going to Howard in the fall. I won't be here this summer. I enlisted. I start boot camp at Parris Island in a few weeks. No. No, why? My grandfather served. My father served. And died. I don't want to... I don't want to lose you. You won't. How can I know that? Just believe in me. Okay? Yes. Well, look who returns. What brings you back here, Dollarhyde? I'm looking for someone. Oh, I thought maybe it was because of Miss Cunningham. Miss Cunningham? Yeah. Such a downer. I came into your class on the 26th of April. I saw it. Why didn't you put your hand over your heart? - I didn't realize in the moment... - So, it wasn't conscious? I didn't realize in the moment... So you weren't impugning our Pledge of Allegiance? - No... - All you have to do is apologize, say you're sorry, and agree that you were wrong. Mistaken, let's say that. And not to do it again. No. I... I didn't realize at the time, but I was doing it for a reason. I couldn't agree with the wording. "Liberty and justice for all," not now. Not with Vietnam, and now Martin Luther King's killing. - I can't blame her. - Do you not believe in America? - Oh, I believe in America. - Not what she stands for. You're not loyal to that? I think my loyalty is better proved in daily actions. How I behave as an American citizen. Did you consider the kind of example, as a teacher, you were setting for the students? If they start to think they can get away with such stunts... But isn't it a better example to stay truthful to what I believe, rather than act upon something I don't believe in? She's right. Under this light, you leave us with little choice but to ask you to resign. I won't resign. - Excuse us. - We would like to be heard. Students have been allowed in this hearing with the understanding they would not speak or interrupt. - But we... - You heard... Mr. Leviticus, young lady. Sit down. Excuse me, sirs. Who are you? My name is Lincoln Dollarhyde. - You're not a student. - I was one. I graduated. I remember you now. Regardless, you are out of order in this proceeding. Isn't there someone to represent Miss Cunningham's defense? Doesn't she have that right? This is not a trial. This is a school hearing. I would like to speak for her. We want to be fair. Maybe let the young soldier speak. At Tecumseh High, Miss Cunningham was one of my teachers. I came into her class and I could read, but I didn't know what I was reading. She opened my eyes. She gave me respect, and she deserves respect. - Yes. - I see you are in uniform. I am a marine deploying out to Vietnam. You deserve our respect. The uniform you wear deserves our respect. Our flag deserves our respect. Our country deserves our respect. Dr. King said he was allowed to go up to the mountaintop and look over, and that's what Miss Cunningham gave us a chance to do. In her way. Help us look over. Now we all, nobody more than I, deplores the assassination of Martin Luther King. As well as the riots, and other recent events. I condemn them. Which is why I equally condemn the actions of this teacher. Now white or Negro, it doesn't matter. We must respect the very country you serve. Any other action, large or small, like not pledging allegiance, cannot be seen as anything but, and is... anti-American. Dee. I have to go back in 48. Less. Why are you here now? To say goodbye again? - I had to come... - To tell me why I hardly hear from you? I called. Once. Twice. On your birthday. You never wrote. I'm not good at such things. No, I had to see you before I left. You. Parris Island, Camp Lejeune, phoning, writing? It's about surviving. Getting ready. But I always had this. It never left me. You never left me. But now you have to leave me again. For Vietnam. Dee. Get me out of here. I always loved trains. The sound of them, the mystery and the romance of them. A way to get away, and I always wanted to. Me too. Of course, I've never even been on one. Never been out of here. This town, even. ♪ Hear that lonesome whippoorwill ♪ ♪ He sounds too blue to fly ♪ ♪ The midnight train is whining low ♪ ♪ I'm so lonesome I could cry ♪ I'm, uh... I'm glad you spoke up for Miss Cunningham. Tried to. Let me see that thing again. You know if you can take it with you? Dee, what I do know is around the country, all across it, even here, it's troubled, and I love it, and I'm leaving it. So tell them you're not gonna go. That'll work real well. So you did come to say goodbye. Marry me.

I'll be all right. My dad, he loves me. I know you like to test your father, Delilah... and our rules, coming in at such a late hour. Daddy, this... this is different. I look forward to hearing how. - This is... - Lincoln Dollarhyde, Reverend. You may remember. I certainly do. Mr. Dollarhyde made quite the appearance today. That's not important now, sir. I look forward to hearing what is important at such an hour. I met Lincoln today after school. Well, uh, before then, actually. Before? Lincoln and I met before, last year in fact, when he was a senior. Somewhere, I know there is a point. And the truth. Let me speak, Dee. I know, sir, it won't make sense at first. It doesn't completely to me. But it is the truth. We knew each other last year before I graduated. Saw each other. I can't explain it, how it happened so fast and so surprising to us, and I'm sure to you now. I love your daughter. And I want to marry her. I ask your permission to do so. My intentions are serious, they are honorable, and... I'm alone, my parents are gone, I have no brothers or sisters, I have only my grandmother left. Maybe that is one reason why I so want a family, but... it's more than that. It's Dee. And I'm going to Vietnam in less than 48 hours, and who knows? - That's why we now... - That's a whole bunch, young man, to put in front of an old father so late at night. I love him, Daddy. You love him? How can you know you love him? Love? I loved your mother... and after she died... I was lost. You were all I had left. I adore my daughter... and I want the best for her. That's all there is... and all there's ever going to be. Just do me this... this one favor. Don't rush. Just wait. There's time. Now, in a year, when you get back, if it's what you both still want, then... yes, I'll welcome it. I'll conduct the ceremony with bells on. Now, that's fair, isn't it? Dad, thank you. Thank you. You are probably right. - I was worried you wouldn't understand. - What are you thinking? Don't you know who he is? You mean a Negro? That's right, did you forget it? Well, he's the boy I love. - He's a black boy you know nothing about. - I do... He's a boy who supported that damn teacher. Well, he was right. She's a great teacher. - She's a fired teacher. - Because she didn't put her hand - over her heart, that's all that happened. - Well, here's what isn't going to happen. There's no marriage to that boy. Even if he wasn't a Negro. Which he is. Not going to happen. I won't condone it. Permit it. Never. - But you said... - No, Delilah! My grandmother let me have it. Marry? Marry a white girl? No such thing is going to happen, she said, while she's still wheeling in her wheelchair and drawing air into her feeble lungs. Yeah, I should have known. Your father was so great. We'll figure it out. You know, maybe waiting's best. Maybe he was right. Right. What else did he say after I left? He mentioned Helen Cunningham. In that room, I thought he despised me. What I said when I defended her. You standing up for her... maybe even that's when I knew, if I didn't already, I loved you. You told him that? I... I defended you. Maybe not enough. Well, I wish I'd been there to hear it. What are we gonna do? I've got to go. But I'll write. - Sure you will. - I will. And I'll be back. I'll come back. I have you now, Dee Covern, to come back to. I promise I do. Fall in! Get your shit together, ladies, and march your asses into the belly of that beast. You know how to march. You put one foot in front of the other. Forward, hut! Hah, hah! "There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, the earth and every common sight to me did seem appareled in celestial light, the glory and the freshness of a dream. It is not now as it hath been of yore, turn whereso'er I may, by night or day, the things which I have seen, I now can see no more." There it is. Wordsworth, worth words. Learn it, memorize it, love it. For tomorrow's test. Every day a test, every day memorize. Memorize, memorize. I hate memorizing. I can't memorize worth a dang. Hello? Hello? Earth to Dee, wherever you are. Hey, are you all right? Fine. You don't look so fine. I'm fine. Okay. That's exactly what it is. You do have a slight temperature, 99.6. - And the bleeding? - Open. It could be anything, probably nothing. It's not your period? You're not pregnant, are you? No. Well, if you were, sometimes a little bleeding happens as the condition sets itself. Nature getting things right. If you were pregnant. But of course you're not, are you? No. Excuse me, Miss Cunningham. Dee Covern. May I talk to you a minute? Well, I would much rather be stacking boxes of Wheaties and, let me see, what's next... Spam. I hope you're not going to ask, please, what actually it is in these cans. Can I ask you a question? - Shoot. - I need help. Look at me, I'm not sure I'll have any answers. I'm pregnant. We may be in the wrong section of the supermarket. Come on. Are you sure? No. It probably helps to know a little thing like that. Yes, then. One assumes such an event didn't happen alone, without help. You know the father. Lincoln Dollarhyde. Do you love him? Does he love you? Does he know? No. You have to tell him. He's a good boy... Man. You two are still together then. Lucky you, unlucky you. Write him. I can't tell him. And I can't lie to him, so... No. What are you gonna do? I... I want the baby. How can you know that yet? Really, with all that faces you, you don't know anything yet. I'll help, but you have to tell your father. You haven't yet, have you? Whatever I may feel, the Reverend, he's a big deal around here. Successful. A servant of God. Can you do that? Tell him. Stand up to him. Okay. All right. All right. No! This can't be. I won't let it be. I said no. - Yes. - What has happened to you? What did that damn Negro do to you? - Nothing. - Your mother. What would she think? What it would do to her, the shame, the disgrace. There can't be a baby! Let's pray. Pray with me now. Pray to God. Oh, dear God, we beg you to hear us and save us. Save my daughter. Say it. - Dear God, we beg you. - Oh, God, please. God, please, save my daughter. Please. I prayed last night... all night. This morning I have the answer. It's the only solution. We'll do it. I contacted the Florence Home west of Knoxville, a hundred miles from here. Yes. - What? - Yes, they have room. They can take you. They'll take care of you. You'll have the baby. Dad, thank you. Yeah, we'll say that you're visiting Aunt Mary Ann, that she isn't well. Which she isn't. It isn't a lie. And then, Delilah, then you can come home. No one will ever know. - I... I don't understand. - It will be a secret. As if it never happened. It'll be all right. All good again. - This is what good families do. - Y... You're not making sense. We're giving the baby away. No baby. Never happened. No Lincoln Dollarhyde. Never happened. Yes. Daddy... Move over here. How many? How many bags today? Charlie's coming. Every day you say that, every day we do this, and every day they don't come. I'mma count 'em. All right, one, two, three... - He's gonna count 'em. - ...four, five... Forty, who was the first to realize you weren't the brightest bulb? Hey, water over this way! My brother, mother, father, so what? How did they come up with Forty? Forty Watt? Well, forty's my favorite number. What's he doing? Hey, Dollar, what are you doing? I'm trying to write a letter. Another one? Why? You belong here, Dollar. You crazy. Fugazi. They're coming. Hey, Skip. Get that canteen. Give me some of that twine, Forty. ♪ My folks weren't understanding ♪ ♪ When they found out They sent me from the home place ♪ ♪ My daddy said if folks found out He'd be ashamed to ever show his face... ♪ You can go in now. Delilah. Beautiful name. Dee. Everyone calls me Dee. Oh. Dee then. Please, sit down. We welcome you here, Dee. Shame, guilt, I know you must be feeling them - for this baby that you don't want. - But, I want my baby. Of course, it's natural to feel that you do. But the world is bigger than you are. This would mark you, color your entire life, you could never escape it. We don't want that. Here at Florence, we provide a safe haven. Consider the alternative. There are some crazy, irresponsible places out there. Dangerous. But here, we give your baby to someone unlucky, or who for some tragic reason is unable to have a baby of her own. It's a precious, loving, invaluable service. It's a gift. Be grateful, Dee. It means when you leave here, you can leave behind all that shame and horrible guilt. Start your life over. It's a unique opportunity. Well, when you're settled in we will sign the necessary paperwork giving us rights. Your father's already signed it. Hi. - I'm Irma, you're... - Dee. I am so glad to have a roommate. It could be so awful, and they are so nice. Mrs. Jorgenson, all of them. Everybody. I made such a mistake, but, felt awful, but I'm going to be okay. Thank God. I'm proud to give my baby away. Aren't we lucky? Girls, this is Delilah. Dee. We only use first names here. Hello, Dee. I brought the paperwork. We really do need it, so after dinner take a look, read it, sign it, bring it back. Mm-hmm? Bless this food, oh, Lord, and us to thy service. Amen. Amen. Over here! Over here! Grab the 50 cal. You hear that? What's that? Shit. Come here. Come here. Hey... Dollar. Dollar. Look who's stalking us. Hey, buddy. Probably more scared than we are. Christ, half-dead mutt. Well on his way to being dead dead. - What should we do with him? - Keep it. Hell, we could use the company. All right, dog. We're going to call you "Dog." Maybe just "Dee." - All right. - Dee. Dee. Sergeant Major, bring your squad up! My busy bees. I love smelling clean. It's a pretty amazing combination we have here, Irma. I believe what is walking down my forehead and running down my armpits is what some folks call perspiration. But in my case can only be referred to as sweat. And my sweat, as much as I hate to admit it, don't smell clean. That's because you're so close, Mare. You should sit down. There are chairs. Look at you. You're growing, I see it. Of course, I'm not. Not yet, as you can so plainly see. Do you say eight months, one week and counting, or three weeks and counting down? Did you just start talking at birth and never stopped? Just imagine any time, any minute, probably two of you talking. Never gonna be two. - I know. You'll be all right, - What do you know? You all want to be here. I want my baby. - What? - I want my baby. That's it! Reload, reload! Stand in for defensive target. You got it! Stay down! You best get your ass over here, Dollar. Hey, what are you doing? Back up! Back it up there! What's that? What the hell's that? Every day. I write every day, not missing a day. Every day. A hundred and forty-two? Only 223 left. Fugazi. Let's go. Lay those weapons on the bridge! Holding, holding! Oh, shit! You don't have to say your shit anymore, O'Brien. They're not coming, they're here. - I need a medic! - Medic! Well, that was pretty, wasn't it? And I used to be pretty, people said so. What a mess. It'll be all right. You won't tell anyone, will you? Please, I know I'm different, but you can't understand. Nobody here can. You might be surprised. Dee. I called you in because I heard Mare had some trouble today and you were there. Just happened to be. She all right? She's pretty pregnant. I worry about her. A little worried about you, too. Me? I've let time go by. Almost a month, more than I ever have before, maybe more than I should have. The final paperwork. You need to do it. Think of the family you'll be helping. Think of yourself. Saving yourself. You just need to sign it, Delilah. Are you out there? Are you coming back? Tell me, please, Lincoln Dollarhyde. Please. Here's the next batch of those Dollarhyde letters. I was worried there, Reverend. A couple of days, almost a week, not a one. Well, here they are. Thank God. Indeed. Damn it.

Smoke 'em. Hate 'em. Smoke 'em. Yeah, I thought one of you'd be up. So I just thought I'd come and sit for a while. Wait. Mare's asleep, but I couldn't. Mm. I'm not surprised. Maybe because you're wondering, who is this woman just driving around? Well, you deserve some sort of an answer, so... One, Lily Grover, that's me. I used to be a nun. Well, not exactly. I used to be an RN. Well, not exactly. Now, I'm a midwife. Exactly. I was raised Catholic, then I tried to make up for it. I had a botched abortion. So then I went to nursing school and I learned some medicine. And that led me to think that if a woman wanted to have a baby, and someone was going to have their hands literally on life and death... better mine. I think my baby's coming! All right. Let's do this. Come on, You too. You gotta scrub up. There you go. We're all in this together. All right, girls, it's time. Let me get some of those wet towels. Let's get her forehead.

I haven't heard from him, but I believe in him. - What if he doesn't come back? - Oh, he's coming back. I know it. I have to know it. There's this... this thing inside me, growing every day, deeper inside me every day, me growing with it. If he doesn't make it back, I'll have him in our baby. We'll make it together. - Yes. - Reverend Covern. This is Myrna Jorgensen. I have troubling news. Your daughter is gone. What do you mean "gone"? We tried to stop her. - You tried? - And she refused to sign the paperwork that's mandated, but you signed, so we must insist that the home still gets paid for our services.

Look, we can stand here and re-adjudicate my losing my job and my livelihood and how I believe you were wrong, that's not why I'm here. Why are you here? How's your daughter? - What does that have to do with anything? - I know she's not in school. No. She came to me. When? Months ago now. She wanted advice. Why go to you? Lincoln Dollarhyde, Reverend, remember him? Seems she was pregnant. Didn't know what to do. Hmm. I'll bet you gave her great advice. I'm not so sure now. I told her she had to come and talk to you, and now I can't help wondering where she is. - I don't know. - Somehow I doubt that. It's true. I love her. I lost my wife. She was my soul. I had to hang onto belief. Mine was tearing me apart. Do you understand? I believed in God... and she was stolen from me. Do you have any idea what it is to watch what you love shrink and suffer and die? Delilah was all I had left. And yet you turned your back on her. I didn't. Then where is she? And why aren't you with her every day, every night, to support her, and what could be your grandchild? No. No. That's not why I'm here either. What? That Lincoln Dollarhyde... the one that loves your daughter... his grandmother was in my grocery store yesterday. She got a telegram. I think you better find her. May I help you? Myrna Jorgensen suggested that I might be able to find my daughter here. I'm Reverend John Covern. Of course you are. There's something you should know. The baby... There's someone here to see you.
