 Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Welcome to Franklin Town. You know, ever since I was a little girl, I have always loved a good old Western movie, and seeing the good guys shooting it out with the bad guys. And all those great old Western favorite heroes like John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Randolph Scott, Lord have mercy, they were so exciting. But I noticed something missing from these epic battles between good and evil, the women. They were always damsels in distress.

 And you rarely got to see the ones holding a gun. So, I thought there ought to be a story where the women are just as rough and tumble as the men. Now, we don't get to see that many Western movies anymore. So, I really hope you're gonna enjoy the story of J.J. Sneed. ♪ At last I have caught up with you And you're a sight to see ♪ ♪ Could this really be my outlaw lover J.J. Sneed? ♪ ♪ Could a woman with a pretty face In pretty sweet disguise ♪ ♪ Turn your cold heart against me With her evil cunning eyes? ♪ ♪ Her evil cunning eyes ♪ Please don't ask me to do this, Pa. For you own good, Maddie. And I'm not asking, I'm telling. I don't wanna be married off. Dilbert Sung's boy

 has his father's old homestead claim. North of Caldwell. He's looking for a wife. - You're the perfect catch. - I don't wanna be caught. I want a life that ain't bound by 160 acres and a sod house. I... I want adventures. I wanna be free as the wind. Damn it, girl. It's time you pulled your nose out of these dime books, and take ahold of the real world. How are you gonna survive alone out there in this dream world you got fixed in your head? I can take care of myself. I'll find a job somewhere. Is that so? And who's gonna hire a girl like you for anything out there but to being a sporting woman? That's enough! I just talkin' true. You ain't no Calamity Jane. And you'll do as I say. The life he's got planned ain't for me, Ma. There's so much more out there, but nobody around here seems to understand that. I do, Maddie. I surely do. But I can't help you. I made my choice long ago. It's up to you on how you make yours. Promised Dilbert that I'd be bring him my Jackson Brothers' hand-tooled saddle. Is that supposed to be my dowry? Caleb. It's time we left. You got chores, young lady. We'll be back by sundown with Dilbert's boy. I want you cleaned up and look presentable by the time we get back. Fire! There's a fire! Quick! Hey! Come over with your pans. Bring 'em quickly! Bring them over! Too bad it ain't this place. Y'all get down by the lake and start bringing it up! Hurry up! Go! Get some hands! I figure if a girl wants to be a legend, she should go ahead and be one. Instead of waiting around to get married off, Maddie Hawkins set out on her own to follow in the footsteps of her hero, Calamity Jane. But a mysterious man was watching Maddie from outside the livery. Could this be the outlaw J.J. Sneed? - Hey! - Get your hands off my horse. That's a damn fine hat. All right, point taken. I just... I just need a good horse, is all. - She's mine and not for sale. - I didn't intend to pay. Damn it, girl. Where did you learn to shoot like that? None of your business. What you looking at? Pretty girl with a Winchester. Of course not in that outfit, but I can still see it. - That so? - Yeah, truly. Well, I'm used to forking manure all day, so I ain't impressed. Fair enough. What are you gonna do with me now? Haven't decided. I watched you. Gathering your tack. You, uh... You heading somewhere? Gold country up north. Whoa. Planning on doing a little prospecting, are you? Maybe. You know, it's... it's kind of hard having a civilized conversation - looking down a rifle barrel. - Uh-uh. All right. Look, nobody needs to get hurt. I just wanna talk is all. Now. See, ain't that better? Look, I don't hold to killing folks neither. - Even horse thieves? - What do you care? Suppose you're right. I'm against hurting anybody anyways. There's enough pain in these parts without adding to it. Yeah. You know, I'm... I'm heading north as well, so... how about you let me accompany you for a spell? What for? Well, it's dangerous for a young woman riding the prairie alone. I can handle myself. I can see that. I can, but, you know... I'm good company. Even though Maddie wasn't letting on, J.J.'s charm was undeniable. Fine. But you take the roan. ♪ J.J. ♪ So, J.J. and Maddie set off together for the kind of adventure that Maddie had only read about in her books. What is it that you do for a living? Besides steal horses. You're an outlaw. Some say. What do you say? Stick 'em up. I never met a real outlaw before. You're famous. No. Now, Doc Holliday, for one, he's famous. Must be an exciting life. Yes, siree. It's, uh... You know, like riding a red bronco on Christmas Day. As long as nobody gets hurt. Yeah, you bet. It's why I like to use diversions. You know, I light a fire sometimes for that reason. Keep folks occupied while I go about by my business. Hmm. You know, I could, uh, use a new partner since my last one took sick. Someone with your skills, who, uh, who ain't afraid. Are you interested? Me? You want me to steal? Think about it. There's no hurry. River's just up yonder. It's a good place to camp for the night. On the surface, Maddie seemed really tough, but as you'll see, everybody's scared of something. Let's find a shallower run. - What for? - I'm gonna look upstream. Whoa, hold on there. We ain't gonna waste time tromping up and down this old riverbank - when here's a good as any damn place. - Not for me it ain't. What if I can't swim? Well, just stay on your horse and don't worry. We can do this. You gotta trust me. ♪ Water, water everywhere I'm drowning in my fears ♪ ♪ Reflecting on old memories Of pain and loss and tears ♪ ♪ Hanging on for dear life 'Til we reach safer ground ♪ ♪ Sink or swim, I'm with you J.J., don't let me drown ♪ ♪ J.J., don't let me down ♪ - Doing all right back there? - How much further? Not much. You gotta loosen your grip, girl. I ain't no squeeze box. Now, whoa. Now, see? What'd I tell you? That weren't so bad, was it? Guess not. We're on dry land now. You can unhook your arms. Oh, yeah. Maddie might have been planning to cook some supper, but things between her and J.J. were cooking, too. Hey, now. Plenty of room if you want. No, thank you. I got a jackrabbit to clean. So do I. Mr. Chadburn. I'm, uh, Deke Fletcher. I just came from the general store. It was robbed a couple days back. And I'm pretty sure it's from this man, J.J. Sneed. The way it was robbed, that's how he works. Likes to set a fire as a diversion, when he robs places. So? Well, they said that your daughter and a couple of horses went missing that same day. - Made me wonder maybe she was kidnapped. - Not likely. - We ain't got no ransom money. - Well, she's your daughter. Adopted. We took her in as a stripling, let her work for her keep. We got her schooled, churched her, taught her to hunt. Even tried to marry her off. But all, nothing doing. So, you think she went off voluntary with Sneed? Wouldn't surprise me a bit. She's got some pie-eyed notion of some storybook adventure rattling around that noggin of hers. Should've never taught her to read. Not much a reward, is it? Yeah, well, it's personal. Huh. Deke Fletcher was a big-time bounty hunter who was after J.J. for more than money. - There you go. - One second. I can tell you ain't used to being cooked for. I'm just coming to a good part. There's a big old train robbery. I think they got it figured out all wrong. Well, I just hope they've got a good diversion in place, all I can say. You wanna read it? No, I, uh, I read people, not books. Is that so? What is it that you read in me? A restless gal who, uh, shoots like a spitfire, itching for adventure, could have the world at her feet. You gotta learn to face your fears first. Talking about that river, aren't you? It's a start. What's going on with that? Suppose it's none of my business. My true parents both drowned. I was 12. We was... crossing to Arkansas. Our canoes, they overturned in a gully washer. My folks somehow got caught up in the rigging. Last thing I remember was reaching for my pa's outstretched hand. Then the current just grabbed me and took me under with such force. Tumbling, swirling, gulping down rainwater 'til I blacked out. The guide somehow managed to scoop me. Saved my brother and sister, twins half my age, brung us to Ox Yoke. Chadburns took me in... but they said the twins had to go. Couldn't handle all three of us. So, the guide put them on an orphan train headed further west. I don't know where they wound up. Lost all track. You ever thought of trying to find them? At first. What's the use? They could be anywheres. Besides, I wouldn't know where to start or how to go about it. Figured it'd take the kind of... the kind of money I don't have. You know, my, uh... My offer's still open. You mean outlawing? What do you know about prospecting? It ain't like any of your books. Now, are you looking for a surefire way to make money or not? You got something in mind? Yeah, I do. I've got a better diversion in mind if, uh... Well, if you ain't too afraid. Count me in. No reason to be goosey. We'll be just fine. Hey, girl. Let's get to it. Oh, hey. Oh, thank God in heaven. It's... It's my mare. Something's wrong. She just took to... to stumbling and then she keeled over like a sack of flour. I don't know what's wrong. I surely do. Mm. All right, let's put her out of her misery. Hold on now. There's gotta be something... Afraid not, miss. Step aside now. It's for her own good. All right. - I... - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on there, friend. Drop the 12-gauge. Drop it. And, pappy, you get yourself on down here and join us. We don't want no trouble, mister. Well, I'm glad to hear that, pap. But for a bit of insurance, I'm gonna need your boots, so... Let's see how quickly you can skedaddle into town barefoot. Go on now, Jane. Jane? Oh, is that? Yeah. Calamity Jane herself. Well, I'll be. What's she doing this far south? Well, the pickings is easier. Now, boots, friend. See, that's a bad move. You done trodden on my intentions. See, my partner... she didn't want anybody to get hurt. What am I gonna do with you now? Where the hell you been? I heard a gunshot. Well, the lookout was dawdling, so I fired a shot at his feet, then he took off like a scalded dog. And why'd you call me Jane back there? Take a deep breath, Maddie. You expect me to use your real name? You know what? You put me in a really tight spot back there, the way you handled that lookout, grabbing his shotgun like that. - He was gonna kill my... - Can't let emotion get the best of you in these circumstances. You gotta use your head. You understand? Okay. But don't call me Jane. Calamity ain't no outlaw, she's a mistress of her destiny. Well, now you are, too. Ha. The Reverend will sure make a lot of money selling these goods to the Indians. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now, this here is Reverend Riggs, but he's more a man of sin than a man of God. My, my, my. Look what the Lord dragged in. Shut up, boys. They're friendly. Always a pleasure doing business with you, J.J. Want a little snort? No, no, not right now. We got some business to attend to, so... - We'll be back before long. - All right. Nice meeting you, little lady. Hyah. Giddyup. Giddyup, boy. I've been dealing with the Reverend for some time now, but you can't trust anyone in this line of work. He always buys your goods? Uses government money and then turns around and resells it to the tribes. Everybody wins. Here you go. That ain't half. Well, you ain't a full partner yet. You're still learning. Now, come on, we got an hour's ride to the Beaver River. Another river? I don't know about this, J.J. River here's deeper than the other. I ain't ready yet. Relax, darling. We're just here to make a deposit in our savings account. See that beaver dam over there? There's only one way in and out. Hey, you wanna go get me your cut? Think I'd feel better keeping it in my saddlebag for now. I thought you trusted me. It ain't personal. I just wanna be able to touch it from time to time. All right. Well, it's your money. J.J.! J.J.! What was that for? I thought you drowned. That's for doubting me. Hey, hey. Ew! While Maddie and J.J. were getting to know each other, Deke Fletcher was closing in fast. Take a little bit more off her chin. This really gonna be in the newspaper? Among other things. Any sign of my lookout yet? No. You sure the man she was with was Sneed? Yes, sir. Drawing on your flyer's a dead ringer. You do this one, too? Yes, sir. Deke Fletcher had a few painful secrets of his own. Thank you, miss. Is that the Reverend's peacocks? They're sure ornery. Well, they're better suited than dogs to warn of intruders. Hmm. Clean up real nice. I got this from the Reverend. I think we can use that to our advantage sometime. - What you got in there? - Whoa, don't touch. It's a distraction from tomorrow. I see you've been busy. Ah, well, there've been never a dull moment. You gonna share that? Careful now. You mind me asking what you plan to do with all that money you've been saving up? When I get enough, I'm gonna buy back my father's farm back east. It was, uh, confiscated during the Great Rebellion, illegally, I might add. I was a young'un, saw my daddy beat raw and drug off by soldiers. He only tried to stop them from stealing his grain stores. Hey. Can I be honest with you? You're about as tempting as a body could stand. Smart... good-looking, awful distracting. Don't be fooled by me. I ain't a good person. No apologies, that's just who I am. We got a busy day tomorrow. I need you at your best. - We best get some sleep. - Yeah. Two cords of wood there waiting for us to pick up. Need that to be done. I'll grab a shovel. - It's okay. It's gonna be okay. - Get up. Get him out of here. Git. Thief! Stop him! Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Easy now, friend. - Take it easy, mister. You hear that? What was that? Come on, let's go! He's fleeing now! ♪ J.J., it's been you and me Right from the very start ♪ ♪ And every job we ever pulled I always done my part ♪ ♪ We agreed we'd stick together Until the bitter end ♪ ♪ And it was my understanding We were whole lots more than friends ♪ ♪ Just a whole lot more than friends ♪ Yeah, there's more here than I expected. And nobody got hurt. Yeah, no thanks to the guy shooting at me in the store. Team work and timing. That's what it's all about. Put my share in the beaver dam with yours. You proved yourself a body to reckon with today, Maddie. Learning's over. We're full partners now. In that case... Mm. You're not so bad as you think you are. This is better than anything I ever read in those dime books. Dreams come true. You cracked open my world, J.J. Like a thunderbolt that... that lit up my days. Filled 'em with excitement, adventure. If it weren't for you, I might still be in Ox Yoke getting hitched to a stranger and feeding his chickens. Truth be told... you done brightened my outlook as well. You know what? I think it's about time I took you out and showed you off. Buy you a hotel-cooked steak. I know the perfect place. You mean it? A real hotel? Mister. This fell when you paid. Much obliged. Save some room for the deep-dish apple pie. Better than in Kansas City. I never thought I'd be in a place such as this. They even iron their napkins. Wait 'til you see the room I've got for us. I'll just be a minute. You know me too well, Ludlow. I don't know how you do it. Well, you just turn them down once and it whets their appetite. You got the touch, all right. Mighty fine-looking. This one a keeper? Well, they all think so, Ludlow. That's the trick, ain't it? Thank you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, a little bit of business first. Tonight? Is that what this was all about? Just wanna get this one thing settled before we can truly enjoy ourselves. It won't take long. All right. Now, the, uh, Sheriff's Office is right next to the bank. So, if I draw him away while you're cleaning out the safe, then there's no way he can stop us. He ain't got no deputies. So, I'll set up the diversion, you get the cash and we're home free. How am I supposed to get the cash? Pull this Colt from your handbag, and you stick it in the manager's ribs. You don't have to shoot him, just scare him. Trust me, that's it. It's all in the timing. Then we'll make our getaway at four bells sharp. Nobody gets hurt. How'd that be? We'll have enough money to do whatever we want. My farm. And, uh, maybe you can track you kin. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I'm ready when you are, honey. How you doing, Sheriff? The livery's on fire. There's a fire at the livery. Shouldn't you be seeing to that, Sheriff? The livery don't pay me. - You just gonna sit there whittlin'? - Yep. - Hurry! - Yes, right there! Come on, Maddie. You're past four. Help! - Hurry up. - Hey, can I get another shot? - Help, she robbed the bank. - Let's git. Oh, my God, you shot him. J.J.! Finish him off, Maddie. Put down the rifle, young lady. I can't. Hey, she shot the sheriff! Don't let 'em get away! Hyah. Come on. Go. Come on. Hyah! Doc, over here. She hit the sheriff's shoulder. Help me. Well, I gotta say, things weren't looking so good for J.J. and Maddie. She lost the bank money, and he almost lost his life. Look like you could use a drink. How's he doing? Asleep for now. Shot bad, and it's all my fault. How so? Trouble in the bank. I was late getting out. When I finally got through that door... all hell broke loose. I lost all the money. I just... I couldn't. You know, looking back and blaming yourself is a waste of time. I can't let him die. This ain't no storybook tale. I need him. No, you don't. I ain't no saint... but I'm here to tell you J.J. Sneed makes me look like one with everything he's done. I know what we're doing wasn't how I was brought up, but I'm thinking in time I can change his ways. We are good together, Reverend. There's a goodness in J.J. that others don't see. We can have a fine life together. You best get some sleep, girl. ♪ And it was me that kept you warm When nights were dark and cold ♪ ♪ But I guess I didn't look like much In these old ragged clothes ♪ ♪ But you said it didn't matter 'Cause you love me any way ♪ ♪ And you said that no one else Could ever steal your heart away ♪ ♪ Steal your heart away Steal your heart away ♪ It's been a rough two weeks, but you're looking much better today. Am I? I know you're still upset about what happened with the bank money. But I got a plan how to make things right. How so? The Reverend says that there's an army payroll coming to Port Scott from Kansas City by train. - Planning a train robbery, are you? - Will you hear me out, please? You remember that story I was reading in the dime book about the train robbery? Well, I think the reason why their plan didn't work was because it was all about stopping the train. We don't have to stop a train. This train has to cross the Neosho River. A river? I will be on the train, you'll be on the river in a boat. I got it all figured out so as nobody, and I mean nobody, is gonna get hurt. This is a second chance for us to haul big enough to leave this life behind for good. Does your nursemaid know you're out and about? I ain't no invalid. I know that, but you sure as hell act like one every time she's around. Well, I'm partial to tender attentions, ain't you? It don't mean nothing. Well, it sure as hell means something to her. Even a blind man can see she's sweet on you. You think I don't know that, Reverend? Well, you better do something about it quick. Else she's liable to beguile you with more than tender attention, and ruin our whole operation hereabouts. What do you take me for? I already have a plan how to cool her off, keep things on track. Now, you keep your nose out of my business and go sell your goods. No offense. So, have you thought over my plan? Yeah, it might work all right. But in my condition, I think we need some help. What the hell for? We're a good team. We don't need to bring... Just calm yourself, be realistic. I ain't 100 percent. Who do you got in mind? The Reverend? No, not the Reverend. Besides, he's making his tribal rounds. I think I wanna bring on my first partner to help us. I'm not good enough for you anymore, is that it? Well, we've already had one big job go wrong. All right. What you got in mind? You think you could bust her out of jail? Her? Cimmaron Rose. She's all spit and gristle. She's a good one to have your back. I've seen her punch a bullwhacker with her bare fist just 'cause he insulted her. You told me your last partner took sick. Well, that's how she wound up in jail in Wichita. That and... she got careless. She, uh... She grew soft on the wrong guy. Come here, Maddie. Come here. This is a, uh, big job, Maddie. And I... I just don't want it to go haywire again. We need the backup. You've gotta trust me on this. You up to that? Good. Hey, Cimmaron. Cousin's here to visit. Cousin? Uncle Jubal sends his regards. Mind letting her out, Sheriff? We got some catching up to do. Now, where were we? You're making a big mistake, young lady. Hurry up. Hurry up. Why don't you take my place in there? Let's go. ♪ J.J., I'm really hoping You ain't played me for a fool ♪ ♪ Yet something in my gut Keeps saying you break all the rules ♪ ♪ When a woman's scorned Be forewarned, there will be hell to pay ♪ ♪ And before you're with that pretty bitch I'll see you in your grave ♪ ♪ And I'll put you there, J.J. ♪ I figure a little spell in that jail cell will slow that sheriff down plenty. J.J. should be well pleased. Have you and him been together long? Long enough. Has he taken you to the beaver dam? You know about that? Our savings account. Me and him plan to buy a saloon and brothel in San Francisco. I used to work the line in Denver. That's how we met. Oh, I bet he told you that money was to buy his daddy's farm back east. - Maybe you're who's got it wrong. - Not likely. I ain't no wide-eyed kid. I ain't no kid. Has he bedded you yet? Oh, I won't tell no one. Hope you don't catch anything though. You're purty. Least we got that in common. Still I can't figure why he'd take up with you. Supper. Hey, I knew you weren't gonna shoot me. What took you so long? I was waiting for the right opportunity. What did you do to rile her up so bad? Told the truth. What the hell'd you do that for? Lookie here, this is all just a big misunderstanding. How dumb do you think I am? If you leave now, then it's empty-handed. Your half is in beaver dam with mine. - You lied to me. - You ever think she was the one lying? - Why? Why would she lie? - You took her place. Settle down and think this through, Maddie. Life is tricky. It ain't like the tall tales in your dime books. - Get out. - All right, I'm going. Things will look different in the morning. Guaranteed. Cimmaron. Cimmaron Rose. Is that you? Wow. My, you're back. Where's J.J.? Inside with the little miss. I gotta grab my goods and get the hell out of here. All right, you little outfits. Get out of here. You're free. You're free. I don't need you no more. Hey. What's all the commotion? Some damn bounty hunter's tracked that freight goods that you stole back to me. Lone Owl's braves have been trading them for guns. Lone Owl says that feller's gonna be here soon enough. I don't want any part of it. I'd suggest y'all vamoose, too. Now that you had your little fling, I think it's time to get rid of your new partner. You'd rather split the take three-ways? Well, what do you propose we do with Maddie? What do you think? I say we lock her up. What? You going soft on me, J.J.? If this bounty hunter comes and he takes her prisoner, he's gotta deliver her into town. Buys us some more time. A dead body don't. I missed you, J.J. What the hell are you doing? After everything we've been through? I thought you loved me. That was a mistake. You don't believe me, but I'm doing you a favor. - You son of a... - There's been a change of plans, darling. Read yourself to sleep, hon. Be good and everything will be just fine. If you go to prison, well, at least you won't be dead. ♪ Hey, do you recall that Union Bank We robbed in Franklin Town? ♪ ♪ And as we made our getaway The sheriff gunned you down ♪ ♪ But I doctored up your bullet wounds And I nursed you while you're sick ♪ ♪ But now you have betrayed me ♪ ♪ Is that the thanks I get? Is that the thanks I get? ♪ Maddie Hawkins. What's going to happen to me? You're going to jail. You might even hang. You know... it's bad enough that he's a firebug and all, innocent people get hurt... or die. My wife, six months pregnant. What I can't figure is why all the killing besides? He got a freight lookout. And that feller at the tinware store. Now, he was killed, too. I didn't kill nobody. I couldn't do that. Yeah, well, it don't matter. Sooner or later, I'm gonna catch up to those other two. She's bad as he is. Peas in a pod. You don't happen to know where they are, do you? No. Well, I'll find 'em. Things for Maddie Hawkins had gone from bad to worse. But at this moment, she only had one thing on her mind. Settling the score with J.J. Sneed. Maddie got away, but Fletcher was hot on her tail. Oh, she came back here, all right. I'll be damned if I can figure out why. Think you can pick up her trail from here? From the looks of that packed mule, Maddie's train robbery paid off big time. Ha. For Cimmaron Rose and J.J... Whoa. There must be enough money in that army payroll to buy half of San Francisco. I'm thinking we should stop for a week in Denver before going over the Rockies. Whatever you say. For now you're gonna need a hand getting everything out of that beaver dam. Then we'll split it up. See, I don't think so. Best split is no split. You can't be serious. What about my brothel? Your saloon? I think you mean my brothel. My saloon. Goodbye, Cimmaron. Drop the rifle and get rid of your .45s real careful-like. - Listen, hon... - Shut up. Been a change of plans, darling. Get the hell out of here if you wanna live. This is between me and him. Got more grit than I figured. Leave the mule and the money. Get! Just stay calm, Maddie. I know you're confused. I ain't confused. I'm perfectly clear. You're a liar, J.J. Let's just talk this over like when we first met. Remember? There's nothing to talk about anymore. You betrayed me. You are a liar and a killer. Maddie. It's just us now. We got the money. You can go and get your brother and your sister. We can start a life together. We can do that now. See? I told you everything was gonna work out all right. And it will. You'll see. Have you lost your mind? Your share was in there, too. No, that was your share. This is my share, and I'm leaving it behind for the army. Except for $30. That's my reward money for J.J. Sneed. I can't let you do that, Maddie. You'll have to kill me, but you won't. You can't. You don't have it in you. You need me! You're wrong, J.J. I don't need you to lead my life or no dime books neither. When you look back on this day, you will regret that you ever betrayed me. When I look back... I will see this as the day that I became mistress of my own destiny. And by God, I will do just fine all by myself. ♪ Well, the good old days are over ♪ ♪ As we stand here in the rain ♪ ♪ J.J., I'm gonna shoot you now ♪ ♪ But I hope you feel no pain ♪ ♪ I hear hoofbeats of the horses ♪ ♪ 'Cause the posse's on my tail ♪ ♪ I guess I'll join you soon ♪ ♪ But for now, J.J., farewell ♪ ♪ For now, J.J., farewell ♪ ♪ For now, J.J., farewell ♪ Come on.
