 Huh? Agh! Thra, what has happened to you? Oh, unhand me! I do not need your help. Goodness! You are old. You were a childling when last I laid my eye upon you. - Your grandfather? - Mm-hmm. How long have I been gone this time? Uh... That long? Yet, still not long enough to see the entire Universe. I could tell you that. Ugh, sending my mind, projecting my awareness through the stars

 is no easy feat, not even for Aughra. These legs are asleep. Wake up! Wake up, legs! - Get help? I am help! - Uh... This pain, this awakening... can only mean some calamity has befallen Thra while I was away. Aughra must find out what has happened and set things right, if I'm not already too late. What are you waiting for? Get my scrolls! Now! Hello? Is someone there? Aw... Oh! I'm sorry. Good morning. This is my first time above ground. My name is Deet. Can you talk? I'll take that as a no. It's all right. See? Nothing to be afraid of. There you go. You like having your belly rubbed? I guess so. I'll rub your belly. Here. I'm all by myself too. Maybe you can come to Ha'rar with me. It would be nice to have some company. Uh... I guess you better go. Disaster! Disaster! Traitor. Must find traitor. Keep your eyes sharp! None may enter or exit the castle without your lords' blessing. We will not fail you, my lord. I do hope not... for the sake of all the good and loyal creatures of Thra. So hard to find good help these days. Escape is impossible. I have positioned guards at every exit. Even now, we are sweeping the castle, chamber by chamber. Rian will be found. The guards will ask questions. Those questions will grow louder when they notice another of their rank is missing. This Mira. Let us see them try to ask their questions through broken teeth. - Two questions answer one another. - Wait! Hm? Explain yourself, Chamberlain. Is no need for breaking teeth. Why do we search for Rian? Where is missing Mira? Is obvious. Rian murdered Mira. How tragic! Hm... The Gelfling will never believe one of them killed their own. Of course will believe. Gelfling have always believed Chamberlain's whispers, yes? This is what I do. I plant stories in ground, watch grow into truth. Keep Gelfling looking over shoulder, and they won't ever see what's right in front of them. Ugh, why waste our time with talk when we have talons? - The Chamberlain speaks true. - Mm... Let us utilize a light touch until the traitor Rian is back in our grasp. - But, Emperor... - You are excused, General. As you wish, Emperor. Hmm... - General. - Weakling. Oh! - Ah, Scientist, at last. - I arrive at your summons, Emperor! Give me some of that essence. - But there is no more. - What? - No more? - You, uh... - We consumed it all. - Lies! I saw you lock a vial away. A paltry amount for further study. Make more! That is impossible, Emperor! My machine was incapacitated during the initial draining. It will require repairs. I need time. Fix it! Of course, Emperor. With haste. With haste, yes. You seem distressed, Emperor. Perhaps some pleasant distraction would be good, yes? Yes. - Yes. - Musicians! Play for your Emperor! Quieter! Quieter! Ah... Better. Yes. Ahh... Drenchen! Drenchen? You know my name, Tolyn. How many cold patrols have we walked together? Since when am I just "Drenchen"? Since your best friend broke his oath and killed Mira. What? Rian? That can't be. Lord Chamberlain told us of the traitor's crime personally. But he loved Mira. He would... he would never... Tell us where Rian is! Easy, Tolyn. I don't know. Think carefully, Drenchen. Are you loyal to the traitor - or to your oath? - To my oath, same as you. - Be sure it stays that way. - Hmph. What a couple of... Rian! - What happened? I waited! - Be quiet. But everyone's gone mad. - They're saying that... - No, not here. Follow me. Quickly. Gurjin, this way! We should be safe here. - I need your help to escape the castle. - Rian, stop. What's going on? All the exits are guarded, but there must be another way out. - Where's Mira? - We can get to the catacombs... They're saying she's dead. They're saying you killed her. - Who's saying that? - The guards, the Skeksis, everyone. - That's a lie! You can't believe that I... - I don't know what to believe. Dreamfast with me. Trust me, Gurjin, you have to see the truth for yourself. - Be welcome, Gelfling. - Please. - My lords! Help me! - Give the Crystal everything. Give it your very essence! Enough! Poor Mira. She's gone. She loved you. And you. Mira deserves justice. They'll try to stop us. Us? I go where you go. - No. No, it is too dangerous. - Mira would do the same for us. She wouldn't take no for an answer, and neither will I. All right. Together, then. So... do you have a... a plan? Yes. But you're not gonna like it. Uh... Hi! My name's Deet. And you are? This way! Maybe? No! Maybe I lost it! Oh, no! I used to get along with animals! You don't have to eat me. We could be friends! Wouldn't that be nice? Huh? Wait! Be careful! Where'd he go? Disaster! Oh, no! Watch out! Let me help! I'm sorry! No! Dede! - Dede? - Again! Again! Are you all right? That was amazing! - Thank you. - Hup! - Hup. Is that your name? - Mm-hmm. Hup! Oh, let me help you. Thank you much, aminya. There. My name's Deet. - I'm a Gelfling. - Oh! Lady Deet. Ah! - Podling. - Oh, I've never met a Podling before. Oh! Nice to meet you, Podling Hup. I'm lucky you came along. Sorry, I don't understand. Oh... Oh! Ha... ah? Uh... You have a magic spoon? Mm? Uh... ha! - Oh, it's a sword! - Mm-mm. Sword, yeah. - You're a Paladin! - Oh... Not yet, Paladin. All-Maudra. Oh, I see! You're on your way to Ha'rar to see the All-Maudra to become a Paladin. - Hup! - Are there many Podling Paladins? Mm-mm. Hup. Paladin. First, yeah. Oh, how noble! I'm also on my way to Ha'rar to warn the All-Maudra of the Darkening. Perhaps we could travel together. I'll take that as a yes. - Mm-hm! - All right! Off we go! To Ha'rar! To Ha'rar! Hm? What this? Oh, it's for the suns. Grottans have sensitive eyes. Mm. - Mm? - I can see you. Ah, bom! What a mess! I should never have run away and left you all alone. - You're just a young Gelfling girl. - Stop. I don't need your terrible apology. I need answers. I'm looking for this symbol. - I couldn't find it in any of the lore. - Enough! I will not help you. Visions. Symbols. You sound like a Sifan. - Do I? - I didn't mean that. Of course! The Sifa know more about symbols than any of the clans. No! The docks are no place for a princess. And Elder Cadia is not to be trusted. A name and where to find him. Thank you for your help. There is always a price to pay with the Sifa. Please! - I'm not afraid of the Sifa. - You don't understand. The Sifa are not like the Vapra. I spent my early trine sailing the Silver Sea with them. I was a foolish boy searching for adventure. Did you find it? And more. Too much more. Well, I'll take my chances. With or without your help. Wait! I will help you. We shouldn't be here. Princess. Elder Cadia has been waiting. How can Elder Cadia be waiting if he didn't know we were coming? Because I am a soothsayer. Elder Cadia... it's an honor to meet you. I had the honor of an audience with your mother once. You were a mere child then. But a Sifan does not forget... or forgive. Either he goes, or you both go. - But I... - I... I'll be on my way. No tricks, Cadia. Hmm... So, what can an old Sifan do for you? A potion, perhaps, to make a Gelfling notice you or something to make your hair shine? My hair is fine. Do you know what this symbol means? Hm! The answer to your question, Princess, cannot be found in this world. Perhaps it hides in the dream space. What's that? Onica, bring the powdered nulroot. - But, Elder... - With speed! Yes. Hm. When Gelfling dreamfast, we share our memories with one another. It is the dream space that allows us to do this. The dream space binds us to Thra and to each other. It is the world within us all. How do I get there? Drink. Ah... You've forgotten something. Have I? Your payment. Sifa do nothing for free. Hmm... - Oh! - Ka! - I'm sorry. - For Ka's sake. No, fine, fine. Onica, lend me a hand here. Hm... There we are. Now... drink. - To the Crystal. - To the Crystal. Hm. You're lying. Am I? I've read all about nulroot. It doesn't make you dream. It makes you forget. Why do you want me to forget this symbol, Elder? Hm. When a child goes looking for trouble, they always, um... They always... What was I saying? You... You have a question for me? I want to know what this symbol means. Yes. That was it. No Gelfling can read your symbol. But when I see it, I sense... the end of all things. Did, um... Did you drink your tea yet? No. - You did. - Huh? You switched our drinks?! I guess soothsayers can't see everything. - Foolish child! - Let go of me! You must forget! I'll make you forget! You just... She told you to let go. Bugger. Why... - Why did you... - When Elder Cadia looks at your symbol, he only sees the end. But I see the chance for a new beginning. End - begin, death - life... it's all the same circle. - Death? - Mm... I've seen the dark signs: strange storms, sand where there used to be sea. Thra is dying. Then... you'll help me? Bring me the brightest jewel in your mother's chamber. Then you will get the answer you seek. - Very well, then. - Return tomorrow night, when the last sister kisses the horizon. Don't be late. I sail with the tide. Hello! - Hello? - Hello. What's your name? What's my name? Hello. Uh... It seems you've completely erased Elder Cadia's memory. Hello. - Hello. Hello. Hello! - I'm in so much trouble. Trouble? I'm not in trouble. Maybe I am in trouble. Rian! What if the Gelfling beef has escaped from the castle? Oh, then we are undone. - Best not to dwell on such dark thoughts. - Yes. - Come out, Rian. - Gelfling! We won't hurt you... for long. - Rian? - You were right about one thing. - I don't like this plan at all. - Mm... The only way Maudra Fara will believe us is if we bring proof. She has to believe you. She's the maudra of your clan. I mean, you could just dreamfast with her. No. I'm a wanted fugitive. If something happens to me, then... Then the truth dies with you. I can't pass on your memories. That's why we're going to bring Maudra Fara proof of the Skeksis' crimes: Mira's essence. - Is that... - The Crystal of Truth. But it's cracked. - And is it supposed to be that color? - No. The Skeksis have corrupted it. Poor Crystal. - So, what do we do now? - Now? We climb down. Climb... down. Oh. Impatient and ignorant, that's what they are. Genius cannot be rushed. Locksnake should keep inquisitive hands to themselves. It's clear. - Look at this place. - We have to be fast. The essence is in the cabinet over there. What do you think this thing does? Don't touch anything! Uh... - Problem. - What? Hide! Mm... Ah... Mm... Mm? Sneaky locksnake! Yes. Mmm... Yes. Sleepy... sleepy... Mmm... Ah! Mmm... And just a taste. Chamberlain! - Scientist. - Explain this nefarious intrusion. I... I came looking for you. - Hmm... Is that correct? - Yes! The Emperor sent me to retrieve update on broken machine, yes? - More essence yet? - Will be soon. Very soon. This is good, yes. Emperor will be most pleased. - I go now. Bye-bye. - Wait! Yes? I smell Gelfling. - Stonewood. - Ah, Rian. Drenchen. Yes, strong. Eh... Hm? - What's this? - Hmmm? - Thief! - Who is thief? You pilfered the vial! Not I. - Must have been Gelfling. - I might have believed you if not for the locksnake bits in your teeth. This is all a mistake, yes? Simple misunderstanding. Ah! - Explain yourself, skekSil! - No! - Villain! - Spineless jelly. I am not afraid of you! What if I slice off that forked tongue? Follow me! Don't stop now! - The vial! - They're absconding with the essence! - We must catch Gelfling! - Gelfling! I think we lost them. We'll celebrate when we're out of the castle. Come on! Vermin Gelfling! Mine! No! Gurjin! Easy, Gelfling. This is all misunderstanding. We are friends, Rian. No, don't listen, Rian. Please, already things go too far. It cannot end well. Give essence back, please. Please! Do not be foolish. Now! - Run, Rian! - Foul sneak! - It's escaping! - Don't stop! - Lamentable! - You'll never catch Rian now. Hmm... We shall see. The caves are deep underground, and that's why I have to wear a blindfold when the suns shine bright. Oh. I don't know how the other clans go about their lives with three suns hanging over their heads all the time. They're giant balls of fire. What if one falls? Oh... What? Hup? Hup! Where are you going? Ha'rar is this way. No, no, no, no. This way, yeah, go to Ha'rar. But Maudra Argot told me, “Follow the brightest star to Ha'rar.” Ah... - Yotsa. Bright moon. - Huh? Otsa. Bright star. I was going the wrong way. Little wrong. Thank you, wise Paladin. Oh! Oh... The Sifa tell me you drugged Elder Cadia. He tried to drug me first. He tried to erase my memory. Tavra, attend to the Sifan caravan. I will join you shortly. As you wish, Mother. Be strong. Brea, what will I do with you? It's Elder Cadia you should be talking to. We can't. He doesn't remember anything, - thanks to you. - Enough! The Sifa are not a forgiving clan. They will demand justice. But... But I'm your daughter. Even a princess is not above the law. Perhaps Brea may benefit from some time spent performing good deeds for the most downtrodden with the... Order of Lesser Service. Mother! Please, you can't send me away! There's something I have to do! Brea, you've done enough already. Sneaking out, wiping memories... stealing necklaces. - Mother, I... - Report to the Order of Lesser Service at first light. That is all. - No, but I can't... - That... is all. Yes, Mother. Hmph. - Ugh, waste of time. - Yes. I found the Gelflings' offerings sadly lacking. Several whined of a strange blight upon their lands. Gelfling are full of excuses. Bring the tithes to the Collector's chambers. Quickly now. Captain. - Is there a problem? - It's your son. Rian. Oh... You say that Gelflings stole the vial? It was all the Chamberlain's fault. Well, why am I not surprised? We must make a bloody example of these treacherous Gelfling. And of the Chamberlain. What else could possibly go wrong? Welcome, skekSil. Calamity has befallen. Rian has escaped with proof of our dark deeds. The Scientist has placed the blame upon your head. Hmm... Scientist speaks true. Chamberlain is to blame. I knew it! I knew it! Chamberlain must be punished. I deserve to be punished. Flog me. Scold me. I am riddled with shame. Such shame. If only I had arrived in lab sooner. By time I got there, too late! Filthy Gelfling stolen vial. Prevaricator! Liar! It was you who took the vial from my cabinet. - I tried to protect vial... - Bah! ...but Scientist attacked me! Knocked vial from my grasp. It was then that stinking Gelfling snatched it up. Is this true, Scientist? - Technically. - I tried to stop them. Caught the slimy Drenchen Gelfling. He stabbed me. Oh, the pain! But I held on. Put him in chains. - Unlike Scientist... - Huh? ...who allowed Rian to escape with essence. The vial was clearly the Scientist's responsibility. - But, Emperor... - He must be punished! Oh, dangle the tail! Dangle the tail! - Yes! Strap him to the Needler! - No! The Scientist's errors require a more permanent discipline. You speak truth, Emperor. But Scientist is still Skeksis, yes? Perhaps Scientist would most benefit seeing... peeper beetle. What an excellent suggestion. My most adored of the Five Ocular Castigation. It has been many a trine... ...since any saw the peeper beetle. Please, Emperor, not that! I beseech you! Prepare the Scientist. - Ah... - No! Please! - Come now. - No! - Come. - Please! No! Mmm... Shame. Such shame. Mm... Out of my spot. Yes! A fight! - My lords. - Huh? I request an audience. How dare you request anything of your Emperor? Mmm... Ah, sire. Ordon is traitor Rian's father. Ah... Let him speak. As you command, sire. I come to beg mercy for my son, Rian. No mercy for murderers! He is no murderer! The Drenchen has already confessed to everything. - Gurjin? - Yes! This Gurjin conspired with son Rian to steal from us. - Mm-hmm. - When Mira discovered plan, they killed her and tried to flee. Is lucky for all I was able to capture Gurjin. Mighty Emperor, give me leave to go after my son. Once I find him, - we can dreamfast. - No! No! You must not dreamfast with Rian. We believe his mind is infected. It might spread. He is sick, yes? Yes! That would explain his actions. He is not well. Can you heal him? Please, surely the Lords of the Crystal can make my son whole again. Mmm... - Sire... - Mm-hmm... Hmm... - Mm-hmm. - Mmm... Go. Find Rian. Bring him and the treasure he stole from us back to the castle. Then, by the power of the Crystal, we will heal your son. Thank you, Emperor. Thank you. Why do we play these ridiculous games? We are wasting precious time, Chamberlain. Nonsense. Who knows a son better than his own father? He will bring us the vial and the traitor. And we will drain them both! Then, essence for all! Essence for all! Essence! Essence! Essence! Essence! Essence! No help! No, no, no, no! Useless! This one. No! No, no, no. One trine, look... What? Aughra has no time to eat! Huh? Searched books of prophecy, scrolls of divination - nothing! Still have not found the reason Thra cried out! Up! Up! Stop squirming! I must find what has happened in my absence. I could... I could ask the Mystics. No, no, no, no. No time for riddles. Hm... The Skeksis promised to keep Crystal safe while I journeyed the stars. They must have the answers I seek. No! No! Fetch the cage. Oh, mercy! Cage! No! When we fail ourselves... ...we must be punished. When we fail each other... ...we must be punished. When we fail our Emperor... ...we must be punished. Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Mercy! Mmm... It will all be over soon.
