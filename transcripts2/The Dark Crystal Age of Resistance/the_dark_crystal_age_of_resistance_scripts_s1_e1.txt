 Another world. Another time. Another age. Thra... a wondrous planet circling three suns. And at its center, the Crystal of Truth, the heart of Thra and the source of all life. Since the land was young, Aughra protected the Crystal... for she knew that the Crystal... ...connected all the creatures of Thra. But closest to her heart were the Gelfling. Seven clans of Gelfling call Thra home.

 From the proud Vapra in the mountain city of Ha'rar... the most cultured of the Gelfling, who rule over the Seven Clans... to the fierce Stonewood, who dwell in the Endless Forest, renowned for their prowess in battle... and the gentle Grottan, who live deep beneath the ground... in perfect harmony with all of Thra, forgotten by the world above. For uncounted millennia, all of Thra existed in perfect balance. But then, new beings came, not of Thra. The Skeksis.

 They bewitched Aughra with stories of the Universe and built her an orrery... so that she might discover the mysteries of the Cosmos for herself. And so, Aughra turned her eye to the stars... and entrusted the Crystal of Truth... to the Skeksis. Almost a thousand trine have passed since the Skeksis declared themselves Lords of Thra. Now, once again, the Skeksis gather in secret as another day dawns... to steal life from the Crystal they have sworn to protect. Ahh! So they may replenish themselves. Cheat death... ...by harnessing the power of their treasure. Their prize. Their prisoner. The Dark Crystal. Hm? The Crystal fails us once again. Well, what did you expect? Nothing yesterday, nothing the day before. Why? Why does this happen? Just look at the Crystal! We've taken too much! Ha! It's gluttony! Pure gluttony! Oh... - Pathetic! - Huh? You sound like frightened Podlings. But, Emperor, if the Crystal will not give, we will die. Die! Die! Huh? Never! We have nothing to fear. Already a solution lies within the Scientist's very grasp. - Is that not so? - Uh.. uh... Our mighty Emperor speaks true. I am hard at work on this troublesome inconvenience, yes. Patience. We are Lords of the Crystal. We have ruled for an age and will rule for all ages yet to come. - We are eternal! - Yes. - Eternal. - Eternal. Mm-hmm. Now, go. The Emperor is wise. Emperor, Emperor... - Emperor! - Yes, what? I... I would not dare question your wisdom, but you know I have found no solution. Ah. The Crystal is the heart of Thra. They are one and the same. But the more we take, the less it gives. All our survival is at stake! So, find a solution. Of course, Emperor. Forgive me. I did not build an empire only to watch it turn to dust. I will find the answer, Emperor. You will see! I will not fail you! I will not fail you! Hmm... The Gelfling know nothing of the Skeksis' crimes. The truth must come to light. The fires of rebellion must be lit. And a new age must begin. The Crystal of Truth has been corrupted. That corruption spreads through Thra and into its creatures. Even the ones locked in the Skeksis' cages, captives... ...until today. Uh... - Rian! - So... hello again. Easy, friends. It's my sworn duty as a castle guard to keep the lords safe. How do I know these aren't poisoned? - Well, there's only one way to find out. - No! I'm sure the lords wouldn't mind if a few went missing. After all, the Skeksis are generous. And you have to admit, these do look tasty. Hm... Psst. Hey. I didn't take anything! See? - You don't have to be rude. - Mira, run! Thank you! - See you tomorrow! - Let's get out of here. - Did you see those Podlings' faces? - It's almost too easy. They never seem to learn. - Race you to the Spy Glass! - Last one there's a flat-footed Nebrie! Uh... Huh? Made it. Hello! There you are. I was afraid you got lost. - You cheated. - I win again. You won because you have wings. Course I do. I'm a girl. And you're a flat-footed Nebrie. Do you remember the first time we came up here? How could I forget? Show me. You mean... dreamfast? Yes! I mean... if you wanted to. - Well, uh... I do if you do. - Yes. - I want to dreamfast. - Oh, good. I do too. I remember everything about that night. I was so nervous. I could tell. I used every trick I had to try and impress you. You certainly did try. I was distracted. All I could think about was kissing you. And I got sick of waiting. So I kissed you. - Mira! - Wait, what... Must've snuck in. An Arathim soldier wouldn't risk entering the castle. Well, that one is! Then we have to tell the captain. Come on. Remember your oath. We protect the lords. The lords protect the Crystal. When one of us fails in our duty, we all fail! By the Crystal! Positions! Another trine, another wretched carriage ride to Ha'rar, another interminable tithing ceremony. I enjoy the Gelfling capital. I think it possesses a certain malodorous charm. Oh, that mountain air plays havoc with my pustules. Well, I have read of a Grottan potus that might offer some relief. - It's pointless. - Shoo! Shoo! They always come back. Always! Oh, dear. - Bring in the Armaligs! - That was a long one. Get a move on! Secure that Landstrider! - Load up the weapons! - Secure the harness! - Captain Ordon! - We need to talk to you. It can wait. Plans have changed. I will now escort the lords to Ha'rar personally. - Huh? - You're leaving? Mm-hm. Then you need a Gelfling to lead the guard while you're gone! Yes. A Gelfling who has excelled in all the drills. A Gelfling who has spent his whole life in the castle. A Gelfling who respects tradition. - That's why I chose Tolyn. - Huh? Tolyn? - Really? - Hm... But I'm ready! It's a job for a soldier, not childlings who steal treats when they should be on patrol. Tattletales. - That was just a bit of fun. - That's all it ever is with you. Perhaps one day you'll prove worthy of taking up my mantle. - But, Father... - Captain. Yes, Captain. What's the hold up? Ah... the second brother is in its zenith. Let us be gone! Yes. Saddle up! Captain Ordon, please. Before you go... So, we saw... What did you see? Make it quick. Uh... - Uh... - Go on. Tell him, Rian. It can wait. Safe travels, Captain. Remember your oath. Ready the captain's Landstrider! The lords are due in Ha'rar by sundown. We march! Hiyah! Come on! Come on! I'm sorry, Rian. That's all right. Why didn't you tell him about the Spitter? Since the day I was born, I've had to listen to stories of my father. Ordon, hero of Stone-in-the-Wood. Ordon the Spitter Slayer? I think it's past time my father had to listen to a few stories about his son. You want to go Spitter hunting? Well, how else can I prove myself to the Great Ordon, eh? Settle down. Care to join me? Of course. But we're going to need some help. Have you tried these? They're fantastic. Hm... Gurjin. Sure. - How's my best friend today? - What? What? What do you want? Where is that book? Agh. Mm, mm, must be around here somewhere. Ah! There it is! No, that's not it. Just a moment, Princess! Hm... Here's the rest of the materials you requested, Princess. Oh, thank you. Did... did, did you find Grillo's Lexicon of Lesser Astrography? I shall return. Thank you! What are you doing? No! Don't touch that! No, don't! Princess Tavra... Yes, you better run, creature. - There you are, little sister. - Oh, Tavra. Come look. It's Mother Aughra. And I discovered some facts about swamp roots. You're going to love this. Did you know that tug noot causes explosive belching? - I have news for you, Brea. - Hm? I convinced Mother to let you attend the tithing ceremony. - You're having fun with me. - You know I never have fun. Oh, this is fantastic! Will I get to talk to the Skeksis? - I have so many questions! - Oh, the lords don't like questions. Oh! Why don't they like questions? How else do we learn? Now I have more questions. Oh, Brea, don't embarrass me this time. I won't. I promise. You have so much ink on your face. Now, come. - We can't be late. - Ah. Maybe just one question. ♪ Far from the brothers' blinding light ♪ ♪ Beneath the blanket of the long night ♪ ♪ Grottans work in the dark and deep ♪ ♪ Where the glow moss grows ♪ ♪ And there crawlies creep ♪ Woo! Look! Deet! Oh, hi, family! Deet, Deet, Deet, Deet! Hello, Nurlocs! It's feeding time! I'll see you tomorrow! And remember to share! I hear you, baby! Hello. Hungry? Look, some delicious moss. There you go. Don't eat too fast. Chew your food. What's got into you? How about I return when you're feeling better? Oh, my wing! Excuse us. - Excuse us. Sorry. - Will you keep moving? We have to hurry. Mother wants us by her side... when the Skeksis arrive. They're here! We're going to be late. Unless we get to the... Brea? Brea! Excuse me. Pardon me, please. - Oh, they're coming! - Here they come! Please, pardon me. Mind where you're going, child! I beg your pardon. Excuse me. Pardon me. Thank you. If I could just... Excuse me. Oh, excuse me! Oh... Whoa! Why have we stopped? What is the meaning of... Oh... Watch yourself, Gelfling. Little things have a habit of being stepped on by... big things. My lord, no need to trouble yourself. I will see the girl safely home. - Hm. - There. Do you see? - The lords saved her. - Which princess? - Such chivalry! - It's Princess Brea. - The little one, Brea! - Our princess is safe! A princess? Yes, my lord. I am Brea, youngest daughter of the All-Maudra. You are a princess. Your mother has been of great service to us. You must allow us to escort you to the citadel. It would be our pleasure. Uh... Thank you, my lord, but... Uh-uh! I insist. Come! - Come. - Ooh! - Lucky child! - She's getting in the carriage. To ride with the lords! Look at that. - On our way, then! - Mm-hmm. Not a moment to lose! Look, skekLach. We have a princess in our carriage. Oh... I'm not much of a princess, my lord. - Hmm. - Not like my sisters. Tavra's a great warrior, and Seladon is the eldest, - so she'll be All-Maudra one day. - Blah, blah! Proceed! What's that on your cheek? Ink, my lord. I keep a journal where I record all that I learn. So you can read. Oh, how wonderful! Did you hear that, skekLach? She can read and write. I too am a connoisseur of the written word. I am the Scroll-Keeper. I've read all about you! You're in charge of the Great Library at the Castle of the Crystal! Hm... I see you've done your research. - Is it a big library? - Simple childling! It is endless. I have tomes that go back a thousand trine. Hm... Could I visit your library? No! That knowledge is forbidden. But... why? - Do you see this face? - Uh-huh. - Once, this was a beautiful face. - Um... But then came... knowledge. Oh, hush! Such rubbish. You were never beautiful. I remember. Never. - Where's Brea? - Well... The Keepers of the Crystal! Oh, look. There she is. The All-Maudra looks cross. Not to worry, I will speak with her on your behalf. Hm? What? Thank you. Run along now, Princess. Away, away. Mother... Hm. - What happened to not embarrassing me? - This time, it really wasn't my fault. Quiet. Honored lords... welcome to Ha'rar, home of the Vapra, seat of the All-Maudra who rules over all Gelfling. - As the Emperor wisely... - You'll definitely be sent to the Order of Lesser Service now, sister. - We are humbled by... - You're just jealous, Seladon. I got to ride in the lords' carriage. ...each trine, the Seven Clans, from the fiercest Stonewood to the lowliest Grottan, gift unto our generous lords a tithe. As is proper, the noble Vapra hold the honor of being the first to give. All hail the Lords of the Crystal! All hail the Skeksis! All hail the Skeksis! Cruel, pernicious Emperor, preeminent minds are never properly appreciated in their time. But every problem obfuscates a solution waiting to be discovered. If the Crystal cannot draw enough power from Thra, then I must provide it with another source. Hm... Wonderful! Yes! Ah! Yes, yes! How very interesting. That's enough. I said enough! Cease! I command you! Oh, my, my, my! Beloved Scientist! You must be careful. I may not always be here to save you. The Crystal, it took hold of me. I could not stop it. I felt it draw forth my life force, my very essence. Mmm... I failed again. You need a walk. Come, we walk. You and I, yes? Perhaps a walk would be agreeable. Yes. It's too much to bear. My every experiment ends in disaster. And now, I've accidentally reversed the Crystal's magnetostatic field. Please, small words. Chamberlain is not smart like Scientist. Instead of giving life, I made the Crystal take life. I will be punished grievously for this failure. No. You found answer. You are hero. Big reward. - Huge! - You mock me, skekSil? No, no! You make Crystal hungry. Crystal pulls out essence, but what if we take essence for Skeksis? What if we snatch it? - Collect the essence? - Yes! Instead of taking power we need from Crystal, Skeksis use Crystal to take power from essence. Hmm... Hypothetically sound, but I will need a creature to experiment upon. Hmm... Well, Crystal is Thra. Thra gave life. What creatures are closest to Thra, hm? Most full of essence, hmm? Hmm... Hm... Mm... - Mm? - Mm... The Sanctuary Tree? I haven't been here since I was small. You're still small. You... You can talk? Only to those who can hear, Deet. - You know my name? - I know much more. I know how you care for all the creatures of Grot and how much they care for you. Except the Nurloc that attacked me. It's not her fault. She has been consumed by the Darkening. What is the Darkening? An infectious contamination within the Crystal of Truth and within Thra. For they are one and the same. For a thousand trine, we, the Great Trees, have kept it contained beneath the ground. But we are losing our battle. Even now, it spreads to the world above. You must warn the Gelfling, rally them to our cause. The Darkening corrupts everything it touches. All Thra is at risk. All Thra? Behold... This happens every time. You say, "Let's have an adventure, Gurjin. It'll be great fun, Gurjin." But it never is. I should be at my post, not wandering the halls, looking for phantom Spitters. I know what I saw. Perhaps we should turn back. We can try again tomorrow. Just a bit further, please. A bit further. - Come on, Gurjin! - Don't think so, lovebirds. I'm done. You two have a great time. I'll entertain myself... right here. Let's go. Hm? - All these corridors look the same. - Mm. I think we're going in circles. We should split up. Where's the fun in that? Well, if it's fun you're looking for... How's that? Good. ♪ A loyal Gelfling serves his lords ♪ ♪ And always reaps his just rewards ♪ Spitter! Rian! Don't let it escape! Quickly! Through there! It's escaping. Come on! What's down there? Let's see. Ah! The catacombs. Gelfling are forbidden in the catacombs. Skeksis say... Mira, wait! We don't have wings. - There's no sign of the Spitter! - It could be anywhere! Wait for us! Hm? I'm going down after her! Is that a good idea? All right, new plan. You go, and I'll wait here. Hm... I thought I heard something creeping about. Naughty, naughty! Mira? MIra! Who is next to give? Hm... Your tithe is well received. Thank you, All-Maudra. And thanks be to the Lords of the Crystal. Next! Ooh... Your tithe is wanting. Yes, Your Grace. We beg the lords' forgiveness. Our land has suffered a strange blight. Nothing grows. Hmm. Lovely. What is, my lord? That piece... - Pretty! - ...about your neck. My lord is too kind. It was my mother's. Her final wisdom has been dream-etched into the stone. Now, this... this would make an honorable tithe! Oh! There's plenty of food in our stores. We could pay the tithe. His tithe is his to pay. But... farmers tithe crops. He has no crops. Please, anything but the pendant. Perhaps next harvest... Why? Why do Gelfling hurt us so? Skeksis give so much and ask so, so little! It breaks our hearts. Sad! So sad! - Boo! - He has to pay! He should've brought more! You should be ashamed! - We all have to pay! - The lords are benevolent! - Kind! - He has to pay! They never take that which is not given. I'm sorry. - This is wrong! - This is the law. It's the way of things. The tithe... is accepted! Thank you, my lords. Thank you. Next! You look troubled, child. I've been reading about the tithing. Hm? Hm... The Skeksis laws. Very good. - None of it makes sense. - What? If the Skeksis are all-powerful, and they have everything, then why do they require tithes from even the poorest Gelfling? Because all Gelfling benefit from Skeksis rule. So all Gelfling must contribute. Or perhaps... they want us fighting each other for the leftovers. Yes, well, I think that's enough reading for today. I was... I was still looking at that. I... Come back! I... I'm not done! Don't go down this path! - I'll go where I please. - Nothing good will come of this. I think the Skeksis are hiding something, and I want to know what! - I demand you stop! - I demand the truth! Princess, what have you done? What's happening? No! No, not my books! My manuscripts! Wait! Come back! Ow! Mother? Mother! - Mother, I had a vision! - You read too many stories. No, this was real! I heard a sound like... like singing, but louder. And there was a burning symbol in the air, and I... I can show you! - If we dreamfast, I... - Very well, but quickly. The tithing did not go smoothly, and I'm tired. What's wrong? That pendant belongs to the farmer's wife. No. They gave it to the Skeksis, who in turn gave it to me. - Well, then you can give it back. - Our position. This palace. - The food on our table. - I know. - Even the books in your precious library! - Mother, I know. All thanks to the Skeksis' generosity. - Would you give them all back as well? - Yes. That's a childling's answer! It's easier to have nothing when no one depends on you for anything. I only meant that... It's time you started to act like a princess. I want you in court in the morning. On time. And don't get lost on the way again. I will. I mean... I won't. The Skeksis can't save you every time you're in trouble. No. We have to save them! Deet, you're home. All's well. Father. - Where... - We're all here, Deet. So... she finally wakes. Ha! Maudra Argot? Ah! Let's see how bad it is. Not that I see much since my eyes went. Oh, a few bruises, bites. A torn wing. Nothing that can't be healed. You're perfectly safe now, Deet. No, none of us are safe. The Darkening is spreading throughout Thra. What? What Darkening? It's like... a sickness. Oh, I'd know if Thra was sick. Who told you this, Deet? The Sanctuary Tree. The Sanctuary Tree is a tree. - Trees can't talk. - Mm. Except when they can. Tell me. What did the Sanctuary Tree say to you, Deethra? It told me I had to stop the Darkening. It showed me creatures driven mad, a dying tree, and a one-eyed crone with horns. Not Gelfling. Old and sad. Mother Aughra. What does it mean? It means you must leave. - Absolutely not. - Where would she go? She must journey to the All-Maudra. Warn her of this threat. Deet. Why Deet go? Because the Sanctuary Tree chose me. It did. It chose well. No arguing with trees! Now... Ah! Take this. Rub it on your wing twice a day. Smells bad, heals good! Oh! There, for your eyes. They'll be sensitive at first. Follow the brightest star in the sky north, to Ha'rar. Oh, what's a star? Oh, you'll see soon enough, Deet. A whole new world waits for you. Huh? Mira? Mira? Ow! Contemptible contraption! SkekTek! It smells terrible in here. - I've never liked this infernal place. - Ah! Patience. I think you will be most impressed. This had better work. Of course, My Emperor, you will see. I have solved all our problems. Will snacks be served? No. Don't you ever think of anything but your next meal? I eat when I'm stressed. You must often be stressed, yes? All the time! Quiet! - Begin, skekTek. - Yes, Emperor. The Emperor will skin the Scientist alive if this fails. I have just the knife for such an occasion. Lords, as you well know, our mighty Emperor tasked this humble Skeksis - with an impossible... - Get on with it! Of course. Allow me, if you will, to introduce our honored guest. Come out! Don't be shy! Huh? What is that? What is that? - Mira! - A Gelfling? Here? Sacrilege! - Have you no sense of propriety? - Hush! Continue, skekTek. Be welcome, Gelfling. I require your assistance. Look. Do you know what this is? It's the Crystal of Truth. Yes. Isn't it lovely? No! What are you doing to it? Just a little experiment. Such an honor for you. No Gelfling has laid eyes upon the Crystal in a thousand trine. Look deep into it. I feel... It's pulling. - Don't, Mira! - Ah|! Don't fight. Give. Give the Crystal your fear, your love, your secrets. Please, my lords, help me. - Give the Crystal everything. - I... Give it your very essence! No! Mira! - No! What have you... - What have you done? No, wait! Behold! Here is the answer we seek! Here is life everlasting! Rian... Mira! Mira! My machine! No! - Where did she go? - What... - Where did she... - Where? Explain yourself, Scientist. I have drained the Gelfling's essence. - This is the solution to our problem. - What? A new source of life. Here, My Emperor, for you. Drink. You must drink. Ah! Ah! Agh! How do you feel, sire? I feel... I feel... ...strong! Ah! - My turn! My turn! - I want some! Move aside! - You're in my way! - Don't push. Don't push me! I want a taste! Don't drink it all, imbeciles. It must be saved. - Stop it! - Enough! - It's mine! - Bring it back. I want more! - Fools! - What a gorgeous feeling! What did I tell you? Tonight, we celebrate! Let us feast! Music! Revelry! For this day, the Skeksis conquered death! Arr! Mira... Huh? Gelfling! - Gelfling has seen! - Seize it! - Dirty lookie-loo! - You'll die for this! It saw! It knows! I know that Gelfling! It's the captain's son, Rian! - Oh, no! - It must not escape the castle. - Yes. - As you command! He will not escape us! No, no, go, go, go! Seal the exits. The Gelfling could not have gone far. Has the Gelfling learned what we have done? The Emperor must remember his own words. We are Lords of the Crystal, yes? Even if Rian talk, none will believe. They will shun him. Cast him out. How can they not? To believe him is not to believe themselves. Skeksis reign a thousand trine and will reign a thousand thousand more, until last star in sky goes dark. Gelfling will submit, head bowed, back bent as have always done. Gelfling want to be ruled. Gelfling need to be ruled. Bye! - Deet! - Because Gelfling are weak! Gelfling are small. And Skeksis are forever! We took the Crystal. Thra belongs to us now. And is nothing... nothing Gelfling can do!
