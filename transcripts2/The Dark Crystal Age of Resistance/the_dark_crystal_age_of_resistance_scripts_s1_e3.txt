 There is no higher calling than the Order of Lesser Service. So, no dawdling! There's good, hard work to be done. Keep up! That means you, Princess. Hm. Oh! No carriages in the Order of Lesser Service, Princess. You walk like the rest of us. Come along.

 The Order of Lesser Service is not a punishment, it's an opportunity to lift yourself up by performing the lowliest of deeds... Bet we're chewing snippit root again. - Why would we do that? - [Gelfling girl To feed all the Nebries. Well, they don't have teeth yet, so we have to chew it up for them - and spit it in their mouths. - That's repugnant. Go. One foot in front of the other. I have something very special planned for you all. You know, I too was once a wide-eyed... - Are you really a princess? - I am. I never met a princess before. I always imaged them having shinier hair. Is this your first time in the Order of Lesser Service? - It is. - Me too.

 I became friends with a Spriton boy. I made him sweet mini-katnies, and he made me laugh, but my parents didn't like that he wasn't Vapran, so... jingle-jangle, time to put on the hat! - It doesn't seem fair. - What's your name? - Juni. - Brea. It's a pleasure to meet you. I always thought I'd make a fantastic princess. I've got the hair for it. It's very shiny. So, why did you get sent to the Order of Lesser Service? I created a diplomatic incident by erasing a Sifan elder's memory. - Hm. - Uh... Ah, at last, we arrive at today's opportunity for service. A filthy Podling village. Ooh! The Deterge is upon us! Oh, no! Not the Deterge! The Deterge is an opportunity to cleanse ourselves of our mistakes by cleansing Podlings. Ah! There is no filthier creature in all of Thra than the Podling. The Podling takes to dirt like a Sifan takes to the sea. Which means every Podling, no matter how disgusting... - You forgot your pants! - ...is a gift. Come on! Would you hold still? ...wash away yesterday's misdeed by scouring away layer after layer, from rind to nails. Brea is the most selfish Gelfling in all Ha'rar. She never comes to court. She just spends all day in the library. She's a princess. She has responsibilities, not just to us, but to her fellow Gelfling. - Mm-hm. - It's Mother's fault. She spoils her. Brea's her favorite. The Order of Lesser Service is exactly what Brea needs. - You don't agree? - Hm? I didn't say anything. I know you. I know what your silence means. Come on, out with it. I don't think it's Brea you're angry with. No! It is. Pretend all you want, Seladon, but I see you. I see all the responsibilities you take on. The meetings, the ceremonies, the rituals. You work harder than all of us. Even harder than Mother. Then why doesn't Mother see that? Mother is toughest on you, because you have the hardest path ahead. You will be All-Maudra one day. Good thing you're also the strongest. I don't feel strong. I would have run away with the Sifa long trine past if I had to be at half the meetings you attend in a single day. They really are so boring. Pardon the interruption, Princesses. The All-Maudra needs to see Princess Tavra right away. How did you get so dirty? Calm down! Stop it! Podling! Podling! - You need to wear pants! - It's just a little water! I beg you to keep still! Expediency is the key, Princess, else it will be a long trine for you. Trine? I can't be here a full trine. I must return to Ha'rar before the winds change, or else it will be the end of all things. Or maybe the beginning. Hmph! You obviously have sun frenzy. Ugh! I don't have sun frenzy. I know all about sun frenzy. I read Durken's Deliriums, twice. Ow! Ow! Hey! Well, go get her. Dear... Podling! Podling! Get back here this minute! Podling! Where are you? Come finish your bath. Where did you go? I've got you now. No! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop! Ow! Stop, Podling! Stop! Calm. Shh... There we go. Okay, listen. You don't want to get clean, and I don't want to clean you, so let's make a deal. We both go our separate ways, and we trust that the other won't squeal. Sound good? I'll take that as a yes? Do you hear them? Arathim? No. All the creatures of Thra. I never imagined there'd be so much life topside. It's beautiful. Arathim ne beautiful. All creatures are part of Thra. What happens if we fail? The Darkening will destroy everything. Deet. Hup. All-Maudra. Win. You're right. Together, we unite the Gelfling and stop the Darkening. All Gelfling not help. Why wouldn't they all want to help? Hup knows. Gelfling clans not friends, ya. You Grottan Gelfling. Hup pretend to be Vapran Gelfling, ya. Don't like Grottan Gee. No good! Different Gee. Blech! You go away! Just because they're different? Ye. Hm. I don't accept that. Getting along may be hard at first. But like anything else in life... ...it just takes time to adjust. Hm... huh. - Look! - Yotubi Stonewood clan. That Stone-in-the-Wood. Where's your sense of adventure? Come on! - Use both hands! - I am. - What do you think I'm doing? - Don't twist it. Push! Lift it higher. - It's as high as I can get it. - Push. Here, let me help. Oh, thank you. There we are. Hush now, childling. All is well. - There, there. - Thank you, friend. We were on our way to Sami Thicket to trade our grains when a bump sent our wheel flying. Huh. Sami Thicket, huh? That's quite a journey. The blight on our land has left us no choice but to trade far outside our village. Oh, I'm sorry. Your bags. Thank you. He's a castle guard. He could be the one. What's his name? He can't be. He came to our aid. What was it? That's it. Rian! Do we know each other? Is something wrong? My apologies. The news about the murder at the castle has put the miss here on edge. It is all over Thra. A Gelfling murdered this Mira. Thank the harvest, we have the Skeksis to keep us safe. Yes. But the Skeksis killed Mira! - Heresy! - It is him! It's that Rian! I think it's time you were on your way. Yes, be gone! Safe travels. It's all right. We protect the lords. The lords protect the Crystal of Truth. All lies. The Podling squealed on me! Hi-yah! I know someone is there. Whoever you are, in the name of All-Maudra, reveal yourself! Tavra? Uh... I can explain! - Brea? - Yes, I ran away. And yes, I know I'm in trouble... again, but I could not spend an entire trine wearing silly hats and getting kicked in the face by muddy Podlings! - You ran away? - Yes. Good. Hey, easy now. Easy. Good riddance! So, then Mother didn't send you? Does this mean you're not here to take me back? Not at all. Brea... there's been a murder at the Castle of the Crystal. A murder? A Stonewood guard named Rian killed a Vapran and fled. Mother ordered me to find him. The clans have always been mistrustful of each other, but... murder? Another dark sign. I saw something. - A vision! - Oh? You get visions now? Yes. All right then. What did you see? A symbol. It looked like this... Um... This... sort of, and then... through here three times... and down. Hm... What does it mean? I don't know. But I made a deal with a Sifan soothsayer. - If I bring Onica the brightest... - Onica? Uh-huh. If anyone catches you... Mother's too busy to notice anything. It's Seladon that's the problem. Ugh, Brea, I know Seladon can be... ...colder than the Claw Mountains. - I don't like it when you do that. - Do what? Stay quiet when I know you have something to say. Out with it. Well, I was thinking that you and Seladon are more alike than you realize. That's a mean thing to say. - Well, you're both very stubborn... - She's the most stubborn! Hm. If she and I are so similar, then why is it so much easier to talk to you? That's simple. I'm fun. - Come here, little one. - Aw. Remember, the bonds of sisterhood can be tested... but never broken. I love you, Tavra. I love you, Brea. These houses are all so cute! Hello! Beautiful day we're having. Good day! How are you? I see. Well, all right then. Look at that ladder! I wonder where it goes. Oh! Oh, hi! - Hello! - Huh? Deet, Hup not welcome Yotubi. Blech! Stop it, Hup. They're just curious. Whoa! Look at that! I wonder what it’s for. And why is it full of swords? Let's ask them! Oh! Not safe here, Stone-in-the-Wood. Tintin go Ha'rar. Come on, Hup. Don't you want to enjoy a nice, refreshing Stonewood brew after a long day on the road? Hup... uchi uchi thirsty. And I said, "That's not my nebrie!" Oh, look at that filthy green Gelfling. Oh, she's disgusting! Oh... Ahh... Ah, there's a seat! Oh, oh! No, don't let her in. - What? - Yeah. Excuse me. Sorry. - Tight squeeze. - Oh! Hup? Oh! - Come sit with us! - Mm-mm! Excuse me. What's that statue over there mean? Huh? Do you hear something? No, but I smell something. It's her. - Smells like wet Fizzgig. - Yes. I'm not a Fizzgig. I'm Grottan. - Grottan! Didn't they die out? - Ha! No! Who told you that? Go crawl back in the nest you came from, you dirty Grottan! What? Huh? Hup, watch out! Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Get away! Ha! Ha! Ah, Hup! - Hey, stop that! - All right, enough! - Stop that right now! - I said enough. - The Podling started it! - That's a lie! Hup protect aminya Deet. Rude Gelfling! A couple of days in the rascal hole ought to teach you a lesson. - That's right. - Wait, let me explain! Explain it to Maudra Fara. Podling justista! That showed them. Don't worry, Hup! I'll get you out. I promise. Hmm... You're wasting your time. I won't tell you anything. Not talk. Just listen. This peeper beetle, found only in Crystal Desert. Is something, yes? I've seen uglier. We keep starved. Hungry beetle likes the soft meats. Favorite is round, wet eyes. Peeper beetle goes chomp, chomp, chomp! - Perfect for torturing Gelfling, huh? - No! Never use on Gelfling, only on Skeksis who misbehave. Did you hear screams last night? Friend Scientist was naughty, so saw peeper beetle. Think, Gelfling. If Skeksis do that to Skeksis, imagine what Skeksis do to Gelfling that will not talk. Hm? I am friend to Gelfling, so tell where Rian is, or other Skeksis will make Gurjin scream like Scientist. Tell Chamberlain where Rian is, please! Never. Think on what friend says! Elder Cadia, welcome. - Hello. - Yes, hello. Hello! It's even worse than I imagined. What a nice, shiny palace you've got. Oh, Brea. Hello. Guess I'm not getting in that way. This way! Where are you taking me? Oh, not again. What are you eating now? Hm. Is someone there? Huh? Brea? Princess, what's the rush? Princess, shouldn't you be with the Order of Lesser Service? - I ran away. - You what? But why? Princess? Because I have to fetch the brightest jewel from my mother's chamber! - Come back! - No time to talk. Princess, where are you going? I... I don't understand. Wait! Princess! Where'd she come from? Slow down! Slow down! What's her rush? Where's she flying off to? Excuse me. Be careful! Oh, Brea. The tithing was especially stressful this year, and I took it out on her. Cadia and his attendants are waiting in the throne room. I sent Tavra on a dangerous mission. There's also a line of Gelfling waiting to speak to you about the blight. Creatures going mad. The murder of one of our clan. My daughters... gone. I'm here. I'm always here. You know what I mean, dear. Yes, Mother. I'll grant them all an audience tomorrow. Mother... you have always told me you are the All-Maudra first, a mother second, just as I am a princess first, a daughter second. If we allow matters of the heart to distract us from our duties, then we have failed Thra. We have failed the Skeksis. You and I are better than that. You're right. You will be a great All-Maudra someday, Seladon. Duty calls. - Seladon? - Yes, Mother? Straighten your wings. You look like a lopsided unamoth. Yes, Mother. My journal. Now, let's see. The brightest jewel. Which one is the brightest jewel? The brightest jewel. Treacherous, perfidious Skeksis! Oh, soon... soon they will all see! How is friend skekTek? Good? Mm? Emperor is very displeased that machine is not yet fixed. I urge patience. Explain your loss of eye slows you. My eye is better than ever! I require no further assistance from you, skekSil. But if it wasn't for me, Emperor would have taken more than eye. I want your machine to succeed, skekTek. I want what is best for all Skeksis. You must see that, yes? I do not have time for your gormless distractions, you slippery... Huh? Uh... What are those? Gruenaks. - These are gifts. - But I thought we had eradicated them. These are survivors found by Sifan mariners. They are mechanically minded and surprisingly strong. You've sewn their mouths shut? Mmm... Perfect for keeping secrets, yes? So, we are friends? All is forgiven? - It's a start. - Mm... Step forward! What's your business with the Maudra? - My name's Deet, I'm a Grottan... - A Grottan? Aren't they all... No, we're very much alive, and we don't sleep upside down. - And we smell just fine, most of the time. - You what? I'm here to see Maudra Fara on behalf of my friend Hup, who was unjustly thrown into the rascal hole while defending my honor against two very rude Gelfling. - He knocked me out of my chair... - I need to speak to Maudra Fara. - Rian? - She'll want to see me. Now. Fara needs to hear the truth and release Hup immediately. No dirty Grottan's getting to see the Maudra on my watch. - But... - Follow me, Rian. He's much dirtier than me, just look. Why does he get to go in? Because Rian is one of us! Unlike you. Step forward! Step forward! - What's your business with the Maudra? - It's about Vivig. That's my Fizzgig. Something's wrong with her. Her eyes... - Huh? Huh? - Huh? Maudra Fara. Rian, guard to the Castle of the Crystal. Quiet, Baffi. - Maudra. - Rian. Your return to Stone-in-the-Wood puts our clan in a dangerous position. The Skeksis have declared you a traitor to Thra. The Skeksis are the real traitors. They lied to us about everything. I will not tolerate heresy from a murderer! I didn't murder Mira. The Skeksis did. This... this is all that remains of Mira. She was kind and brave. And her laugh... She was full of life. But the Skeksis took that life. I watched them drain and consume her very essence! You are my Maudra... and I've never seen you lose a fight. Dreamfast with me. Learn the truth, and together we can stop the Skeksis. You're right. Your son is not well. Father? His condition is worse than I feared. I must return him to the Castle of the Crystal at once. - No! Dreamfast with me and you'll see. - No. The Skeksis have warned us madness spreads this way. Rian... - you're very ill. - I know what I saw. - They have Gurjin. He confessed. - Gurjin? - He's alive? - He said you killed Mira. Did you see Gurjin for yourself, or is this what the Skeksis told you? The Skeksis have promised mercy. Come back with me. Let them help, then everything will go back to the way it was. Never! Listen to me, all of you. - The Skeksis are murderers! - Enough, Rian! As your captain, I'm ordering you to return with me to the castle. You are my father. Why don't you ever believe me? Enough! Escort Captain Ordon and his son back to the Castle of the Crystal. - No! - Rian! - Get back. - Don't! Calm down! Get back. Stop! Rian! - Rian, please! - Back. Nobody else needs to get hurt. You're not going anywhere. Watch out! Huh? Careful! He's getting away! - Move! - Rian! What do we do? No! No, Rian! Where did he go? After him! Hm. Bah! Ah... Such sweet pain. Harder right there. - More flowers! - Ah! Ah! Lovely. Oh, that's so marvelous upon the joints. Oh, totally. Glob... Mm... Ah... beautiful. Skeksis? What? Where are you hiding yourselves? Huh? I recognize that voice. - It sounds like... - Skeksis! It's her! It's her! Oh, no. It cannot be. - After so long? - Yeah, she's as ugly as ever. It is her. It's... Aughra. I'm not decent. Pah! It has been many a trine. Hundreds of them. I see you've been enjoying yourselves in my absence. Get out, Podlings. Out! Go! Go! Out, Podling! Hmm... No, get that out of there! Get it out! Pah! So little has changed. Oh, what are you doing? No! Stop it! - Stop it! - Keep still. There we are. You appear unwell, Mother Aughra. Noticed, did you? I'm unwell because Thra is unwell. I've come to see the Crystal, see what ails it. You are mistaken. The Crystal thrives, as does Thra. Aughra mistaken? You speak but know nothing. Or is it you know and speak nothing? If the Crystal thrives, why does my heart ache? Why does Thra call out in pain? Perhaps your interminable age has finally caught up with you. You're ones to talk! Look at you. These are not the Skeksis Aughra remembers. - Fat, shriveled, all at once! - Ow! Ow! Cease! Cease! No, no, no, no, no! Stop it! Stop it at once! Bah! Show me the Crystal. The Crystal of Truth never lies. Not to me. Not to Thra. It cannot. You have no right to make demands upon us. You abandoned the Crystal. We've protected it this last thousand trine. We gave the poor creatures of Thra order, innovation, and purpose. What have you done in all that time, Mother Aughra? I journeyed among the stars and planets... - Ha! - ...that I may someday bring - their knowledge to Thra! - So go back to your travels, then we can go back to caring for the many you left behind. I am Mother Aughra! I am Thra! No! Perhaps once, but no longer. Now we are Thra. I was a fool to entrust you with the Crystal of Truth. You were well compensated. You've got your precious orrery. - No! - Return to it. Guards! Throw this useless old crone out of our castle forever! Out of my way! Ha! Do you really think that's Mother Aughra? She's a lot shorter than I expected. My grandfather told me she cursed his village with ear mites because they forgot her birthday! I heard she sneezed and a whole mountain crumbled. - It's all true. - Hm? All and worse. So you'll stay where you are, or you'll suffer the wrath of all eight and a half fingers. Ninny wheelers. Ingrates. Huh? Skeksis think they can take Crystal from me? Hmph! I am Crystal. The Crystal is Aughra. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! This cannot be! Look at you! My beautiful Crystal of Truth. My heart! The Skeksis made you sick. Aughra must heal you. But how? What is this? It's me, but not me now. I am you when we last saw the Crystal, before our eyes turned to the stars. What have the Skeksis done to the Crystal? To us? The moment Skeksis possessed the Crystal, they abused it. Their corruption created the Darkening. Now, the Crystal has nothing left to give, so the Skeksis abuse grows. And the Skeksis can take that which is not given. Look. - No! - Give the Crystal everything! Give it your very essence! Here is the answer we seek! Here is life everlasting! No, no! Stop! Stop! Gelfling return to Thra when they die. That is the natural order. But when Skeksis consume essence, the Gelfling cannot return home. Thra is out of balance, thus the Darkening spreads faster. What do we do? How do I make this right? Tell me! I see many endings lain before us, diverging paths through an endless forest. Some good, most bad. You must guide destiny. Shape it. Why can I not see these paths? You have lost the song of Thra. Find the song. Change the future before it's too late. Hm! Don't worry, Hup. I'll get you out of that rascal hole. Maybe not this way. I don't know what you are, but you better not come any closer. Ooh! Hello. You're not so scary. I like your pretty neck. Are you hungry? Here. It's good. Trust me. Told you. Hm? Ah... You're all one. Curse you! Hm? Ah, for the love of Thra, light! Oh, come on, I just need a spark. - Light! - Excuse me. - Stay back! - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I thought you might need some help with your fire. Who sent you? Maudra Fara? Huh? - My father? - Maudra Argot. Although, technically, it was the Sanctuary Tree that gifted me with the vision of a coming disaster that's going to destroy us all. But it was Maudra Argot that said I needed to leave the caves. Oh. Hey! Aren't you that Gelfling from Stone-in-the-Wood who cut ahead of me in line to see the Maudra? Well, yes. - I'm sorry. - That's all right. I know how you can make it up to me. My friend, Hup, is locked up in the rascal hole. But if you can get me in to see the Stonewood Maudra... No. I can't help you. My clan has cast me out. - May I? - Hm? Uh... sure. But it won't light. The ground's too wet. We'll see about that. Hm... - Impressive. - Old Grottan trick. Huh. I'm Deet, by the way. I'm Rian. Nice to meet you, Rian. You're... not scared of me? I don't think so. Should I be? Seems like every other Gelfling is. They think that I'm a monster. They're all too scared to see the truth, even when it's right in front of them. Well, I don't think you're a monster. That's it! Monsters! - What? - I know exactly what to do now! You've been so helpful. Thanks so much! - Wait! - No time! I have to rescue my friend. - Good luck with everything. - Uh... Good luck to you! Oh... Hm... Oh... I'm too late. Hello. Elder Cadia! Do I know you? Princess Brea, just in time. We sail with the tide. Cadia, please make sure the last runes are packed and ready for transport. Of course, my Elder Onica. Where did I leave those runes? And what are runes? Elder Onica? I served as Cadia's apprentice for many trine. His recent... memory loss allowed me to give myself a long overdue promotion. Did you bring what I asked? Oh! Yes. The brightest jewel in my mother's chamber. Hm... clever. Now, you have your payment. Tell me more about my symbol. Payment? Of course. - Sifa never do anything for free. - Apparently not! Ugh! The chrysalis isn't payment. It's the answer! Oh... I don't understand. A great many things. You see another bauble hung high on a wall. This is the chrysalis of an imperial unamoth, - the totem animal of your clan. - Huh? Now, ask your question. Ask... the moth? How can one Gelfling know so much and so little all at once? Uh... Where are the answers I seek? It's beautiful. Onica, I'm in your debt. Time to run, Princess. Yes, I... Oh! Thank you. Goodbye. Hello?
