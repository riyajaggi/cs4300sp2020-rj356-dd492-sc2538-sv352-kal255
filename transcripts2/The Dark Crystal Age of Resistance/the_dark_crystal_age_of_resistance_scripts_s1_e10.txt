 - Mm-hm? - Have you been making bombs? No! Well, smoke bombs. So, yes? It's an old Grottan trick for clearing out hollerbat nests. Oh, it stings the eyes something fierce. My father accidentally got a face full of smoke one time, and he couldn't see straight for three days. You Grottan have a lot of tricks. I guess so. We'll need them if the other Gelfling don't show. They'll be here. What makes you so sure? Hope. Um...

 I... I was thinking. Hm? I never properly got to see the Caves of Grot. Maybe we could go back when this is all over. When everything is back like it was. I don't think anything will ever be like it was again, Rian. No. It will be better. Uh, I should get back to work. Oh. I'm sorry. The First Brother rises. It is time we march on Stone-in-the-Wood. Do you sleep? Of course, sire. Do you dream? - Dream? - Yes. No, Emperor. Neither did I, until I began my experiments upon the Darkening. Now, my slumber is riddled by nightmares. Do you remember what it was like... before we were rent asunder? - I don't think of such things. - And yet the thoughts come. - I remember suffering. - Yes. - Guilt. - Yes. And sorrow. But it's hard to recall, lik... A dream? A nightmare. Yes. We know the torment that lies behind us, but what torment waits beyond this existence? All the more reason to hold on to life with all claws... no matter the cost. Come... Yes... Emperor, what are you doing? What I must! Gathering the Darkening. No matter the cost! Mm. Ah... Gruenaks. Ha! Hm? What is this, hm? Out of lord's way. Why so sad, wretches? Chamberlain is pleased with Gruenaks. Plan worked to perfection. Chamberlain is back in Emperor's good graces, where Chamberlain belongs. Mm? Mm? Agh... Go? Leave? No, no, no! Still much to do, plan not yet done. Chamberlain will decide when Gruenak service is finished. Until then, Gruenaks will stay right where are. Hmm... Hm! Gather the Skeksis in the Crystal Chamber. Yes. As you command, sire. - Emperor! - Eh? I have completed the modifications to our armor. I look forward to putting it to marvelous use against the Gelfling. You will remain behind and build the soldiers Chamberlain promised me. But, Emperor, I wish to fight to prove my physical prowess in battle against nefarious forces. You? Fight? Out of the question. Your studious talents lie elsewhere. Of course, my Emperor. Come, General. Time to be on our way. We have nefarious forces to battle. Weakling! Ah! Huh... Rian! Huh? Brea! It's so good to see you. I'm so glad you're safe. I have something that belongs to you. - Here. - My journal! Thank you. Brea? Brea! - Brea! You're back! - Deet! Deet, I missed you. Where's Hup? The Heretic and Wanderer are nursing him back to health at the Circle of the Suns. Good. Are you alone? I brought a few friends. Rian... I ask your forgiveness. You came to me in your time of need, and I turned you away. I did not know better... but I should have. You were only trying to protect your clan. I'd expect no less of my Maudra. Hm. How did you escape the Hunter? I didn't. I was taken to the castle. We were all prisoners. Mother Aughra traded her life for ours. The Skeksis drained her. Mother Aughra? She's... Dead. We must prove ourselves worthy of her sacrifice. But how can we stand against the Skeksis? There are so few of us. More will come. And we have the Dual Glaive. I'm not afraid. Not anymore. I'm done with running. I'll die where I stand before I run again. And we still stand with you. All right, then. Let's get to work. War! Indeed, the Skeksis are bigger, stronger. But we have a few surprises. Now you. Mine's broken. Good. Mm... Ah... There. Good! I am incontrovertibly the most abused creature in all of Thra. Detestable Arathim. - Mm... - What are you looking at? Well? Turn the wheel, Gruenak. Let's see... Hm... Very, very interesting. The fibrous viscera continue to reject revivification. Hm... I will need to find a much stronger source of connective tissue to augment the fibroblasts. Hm... But from where? Ah! Ah! Enough! There is only so much callous disrespect a Lord of the Crystal can endure! I have earned a bit of genuine frivolity. How fortunate I tucked a few vials of essence away for just such a festal occasion. Mm... Ah... Now, clean up this mess, slaves. Ah... Hm? Archer... dead? Not... quite. But not alive either. A force binds urVa to Thra... even... now. Huh? Speaking Podling language... But what could be? - Aughra. - Hm? Hmm... Yes! Good! Play for your Emperor! Faster! Louder! Glorious. Podlings! Podlings! Your Emperor is hungry. Expediency is key. An Emperor must not be made to wait. What is this offal? This rubbish is not fit for an Emperor. When we fail our Emperor, we must be punished! Pugnacious Podling! Ah... ah! Get back here, Podling. Where are you scuttling off to? I'm not done with you malingerers! Huh? Hm... Meh... Hunter? SkekMal? Hm? Ahh! You're... You're alive! Where is Rian? Stone-in-the-Wood. The other Skeksis are there already. They've gone to extirpate the Gelfling uprising. Yet you remain behind? Useless coward! The Emperor commanded me to stay behind. I wanted to fight! I am not a coward! SkekMal! No... Archer? Speaking Podling language... Oh! Well. That was... exciting. Yes! Mm... Mm... Agh, peachberries! Hm... For Tavra. For Mother. They're here. Huh? This? This is the mighty rebellion I was promised? We'll be home in time for lunch. Ha! Look at their tiny little swords! Ha! That's adorable. Oh, I wanna squish the green one. The reign of the Skeksis is over. All Gelfling rise against you. Is that so? Where are they? They'll be here. Nobody coming, hopeless wretch. Gelfling will never rise. You will all die here! Die! Now... For nothing! Oh, the impudence! Then our sacrifice will inspire others. Just as my mother's did. If it's a fight you want, I'll give you one. Just you... and me. Hm... Is beneath mighty Emperor to face lowly Gelfling in combat. Hm? Best left to fearsome General, yes? Sire... it would be my honor to deliver you Rian's head. Very well. And fetch me the Dual Glaive while you're about it. With pleasure. Are you sure about this? - Make him bleed! - No. But I have hope. - Be careful, Rian. - Stuff him good! - Teach him a lesson! - Go on, Rian! Go on! Shall we? Let's have some fun! We have to help him. Pest! We stick to the plan. Pitiful. Teach that Gelfling a lesson! Where are you going, Gelfling? Wait. Rian! Any more tricks? You'll die! Yes. Rian. You filthy Gelfling! What are you doing? Be done with it. Kill me! I'm no killer! Huh? How could it... Huh... No... - Forgive me, Emperor. - Leave. - You failed me. - No! No! - For Shame! - Lousy skekVar! Mm... Stand ready. Next! Skeksis! They're coming! Get ready! Here! Take these! Attack! Now! For Thra! Yes! Take that! My eyes! Yes! Charge! - Swap left! - Right behind you! They're everywhere! I will not be bullied! Come back, you fool! Who wants more? Let's see how you like this. No! Seladon! Fara! I got one! Oh, did you see? Did you see? I got one! Where are you... bug? Eh? Oh, look. There you are! Huh? Ah! Let go of me! Fara! Here! Mangy fuzzball! Argh! Get off me! No, wait! That's mine! Bring it back so I can kill it! Here... How badly are you hurt? Had to protect the All-Maudra. I'm gonna get you out of here. Ow, get off... Get off me! Get off me! Do you hear? It's Thra... calling me home. It sounds... like music. No, you can't give up. You have to fight. We need you. Your mother... would be proud. She's home. Ah... Mmm. Good. What is this? Mutiny! No! No slave! How dare you threaten me! I am skekTek, the Scientist! I am a master of life and death. I am a genius! I am a Lord of the Crystal! I... am... Skeksis! Inbreads. Savages! You bad! No, help! Release me! Brutes! Marvelous cretin! Know your place. You must pay for this betrayal! Hm... Oh, what a waste. Or perhaps... not. Naughty princess! Oh! Hold still! Here! You're not going to dare! Get it off! Get it off! What is it? Get it off me! Help! Where is Rian? Here I am! Blasphemer! Huh? No! Get off! Mm... General. Huh? Hm? There you are. Cursed Gelfling... Good! Fought dirty. I'm not surprised. They have no honor. Friend... skekSil.. I'm badly wounded. Please, help me! Mm... No! You... took... my... seat. Huh? - Rian, watch out! - Ya! - Rian! - No! Rian! Rian! Ah... Greetings, Podling. Archer? Archer! Wait. Hup get help. No time. Help me up. Your friends are in danger. Enough! SkekMal lives! I had a dream that I was one that became two that became one again. I looked through my dark half's eyes and knew Aughra was right. Is this your trophy, Gelfling? This toy? No! No! Mm... The hunt must end. Mm. Rian! Let him go! Quiet, puny Gelfling! I have conquered death! I return more powerful than ever! More powerful than Thra itself! Nothing can stop the hunt! No! Now, we shall see what lies at the dream's end. Archer! What are... what... Archer! Mm... Ah! I am reborn! Oh, no! Not her again! Praise Thra! - The witch is back! - Does nothing stay dead anymore? Mother Aughra, are you all right? No. I just came back from the dead. - Not easy. Help me! - Oh, yes! Mother Aughra, - I suppose this was your plan all along. - It was, Emperor. - I wasn't sure it would work. - Huh? Oh. Now, drag your leathery tails back to your castle and pray I punish you no further! Hollow threats. Your hand trembles. You can barely stand! Yet I stand. Unlike the Hunter. This changes nothing! You few Gelfling... are no match for the Lords of the Crystal! Skeksis! Finish them! Huh? The Sifa stand with the heroes of Thra! Ah, yes! Ha! The Drenchen fight for Thra! The Spriton ride to battle! - The Grottan face the suns once again! - Ha! - Who are these? - The Dousan heed your call. The Vapra have come for Thra! They came! The Seven Clans! Oh! Oh! The Arathim fight by our side. Ah... ha! We are surrounded! They are everywhere! Emperor, no choice. Skeksis must retreat. Cannot win! I will not lose. No matter the cost! Behold the power of the Darkening! Oh, Gelfling, get back! Deet! No! Gentle Deet. What is she doing? Stop! You're killing her! What? Huh? Ha! - No! - How? She just... - Oh! - Impossible! Deet? Get away... from my friends! That wasn't so bad! Oh! - Retreat! - To the Castle! Quickly! Retreat! Retreat! Emperor! Emperor, we must go, yes? - Ye... Yes... - To the castle! - My most trusted advisor. - Yes! - To the castle! - To the castle! Good! Good! They're running away! Ha! Good! Yeah! Yes! - They're leaving! - Yes! Hello! Haha! - We did it! - Yes! - Kylan! - Gurjin! Yes! - Oh, Naia! - You did it. We did it. Stone-in-the-Wood shall rise again. - Thanks to Deet. - Were you scared? - Ah, Gurjin! You made it! - Brea! - Deet? - Good to see you my friend. Deet? Deet! Deet! Well done, my lad. Well done. Oh, thank you. Deet... Oh, sister! - Deet! - Hm. Oh, Mother Aughra! I guess you want a hug, all right. Ah, the heroes of Thra,  together again! Oh, Gurjin,  you've made us proud! - Gurjin! - Seladon! Seladon! I guess everyone  wants to hug a hero. Whoa! Uh... Ah, why not? Thank you. Who's next? - Yeah! Mother Aughra, come on! - What are you doing? Give me a moment. I may be newborn, but I'm still old. - Yes! - I'm moving as fast as I can. Ah... The lost shard of the Crystal of Truth... found at last. This is what the Heretic wanted us to find. Not the weapon... but the shard. The shard is the key to ending Skeksis power and uniting the Gelfling. Ah... Gelfling... the shard calls to you. You fought well. This day is ours. And tomorrow... Tomorrow, three suns rise on a new world. Nothing will ever be the same. We have made new enemies, and lost old friends. But the fallen are not truly gone. They have joined the song of Thra once more. Listen... And you will hear them in the wind. For the song has changed. Deet? Deet! It sounds like hope. Deet! But take care. Hope is fragile. Hope is delicate, like a crystal shard. Deet? Once lost... now found. And easily stolen. Huh? This day's victory does not belong to a single Gelfling or a single clan. It belongs to all of us! All of Thra, united! This day, the many become one! Sublime, yes, yes! Superb! I will show them! I will build their army, yes! The greatest army that Thra has ever seen! We will rule forever! Yes... This is a dark day. Look on bright side, yes? We still live. But for how much longer? The... the Gelfling... they are too many. We will be overwhelmed! They will have our heads. Our beautiful heads! Poor Collector. SkekLach never harmed anyone who did not deserve it. Where is the General? Friend General perished at Stone-in-Wood. I'm just glad I was with in... final moments. Sad. Yes. So sad. Ah... we are doomed! My lords, my lords... all is not lost. I have found a solution to all our problems: an ingenious combination of Gruenak and Arathim. I call it... Garthim! Marvelous!
