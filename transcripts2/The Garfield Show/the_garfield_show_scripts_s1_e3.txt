Garfield, don't eat all the ribs while I'm away. "Don't eat all the ribs while I'm away." Did he really think I'd eat all the ribs while he was away? What shall I do now? I think I'll eat all the ribs while he's away. Mmm. Yum, yum. Good.

 [Odie yips, sniffs] Oh, it's you. You hungry, Puppo? Yeah! Fine. I'll give you the part I can't eat. That's the best thing about dogs. They're happy with stuff that no one else would wanna eat. Huh? A bone! A juicy, delicious bone. Hey, Odie! Look at that mockingbird! He's mocking you! Hmm? Hmm? [Odie] I don't see anything. Hmm? Hmm? [gasps] Huh?! [howls]

 -[Odie whining] -Huh? Another bone? How could you have finished the first one? No, I'm not giving you another bone. [Odie whines] If you want a bone, dig up one that you've buried out in the garden over the years. [Odie muttering] [gasps] Wow! [straining] [humming happily] The best part of eating ribs? Licking your paws. [muttering] So you found a big bone. Big deal. Don't bother me. [yelping] So it's the biggest bone you ever saw? Don't, I repeat, bother me. [yelping] Oh, all right, all right, I'll look at it. Oh, if it only had meat on it. -Odie, do you know what this is? -[inquisitive yelp] But not just any big bone! Come on. That's a dinosaur bone! Those are worth a lot of money! This is the website for the town's natural history museum. Watch. Here at the museum, we are especially proud of our dinosaur skeletons. Recently, we located this one. It's a Tyrannosaurus Rex from the Cretaceous period. This skeleton is valued at more than a quarter of a million dollars. A quarter of a million dollars! Odie, I'm rich! Do you know how much lasagna you can buy for a quarter of a million dollars? Enough to feed me. Wow! I'm gonna take that bone down to the museum and find that lady. -You go dig up the rest of the skeleton. -Me? We found this skeleton in someone's backyard on the west side of town. We had to get a court order to have the people evicted and their home torn down but we did it, all in the name of science. [whimpering] Odie, get back to work. Have that skeleton dug up by the time I get back. [yelp] [chuckles] Oooh! [gasps] [panting] Whoo! [straining] "Brontosaurus, also known as Apatosaurus, lived 150 million years ago and weighed a minimum of 23 metric tons." Twenty-three metric tons? That's more than I weigh after a good Italian dinner. I gotta find that lady who'll pay a fortune for the bones Odie's digging up. [bones rattling] Oh, no! -[crash!] -[guard screams] Hey, cat! You're in a lot of trouble. And first, you put that bone down. That's museum property. Oh, no, no. I brought this bone with me. It's gonna make me rich! -[giggles] -[guard stammering] Oh, no. Whoa! [Tarzan yell from guard] [Garfield laughs] Yaaaa! Aaaah! Oh, no. I'm trapped. There's no way out of here. Okay, I've got him cornered in the Tyrannosaurus Rex exhibit. He can't possibly get away. -[bones rattle] -[guard screams] [screaming] Help! Let me outta here! Congratulations! You're now an exhibit. The first security guard to be swallowed by a Tyrannosaurus. Help! Myron! A cat stole a bone and is heading down corridor 11 with it. Where's that lady who pays the big bucks for dino bones? [guard] Sorry, cat. Our dinosaur bones are not "to go" orders. But I brought this with me! Odie found it in the garden! Hey, I recognize you. You live with that Arbuckle guy on my block. What seems to be the trouble, Myron? No trouble, Mrs. Brubaker. This cat tried to steal this dinosaur bone. I don't recognize this bone from any of our exhibits. It's... It's from a Brachiosaurus. A brachiwhozis? This is one of the rarest dinosaurs in the world. We don't have one in our collection. Cat, did you find this where you live? I'll take the money in small bills. Mostly hundreds. We must have an immediate excavation to find every possible bone on the property. We'll get a court order to tear down any buildings or dwellings. Tear down? You mean you'd just tear down this Arbuckle guy's home? Science is more important than anyone's individual life. Our house! I won't let you! The cat's getting away. Let him. You seem to know where the property is. Let's go. Myron? Myron, can you hear me? Could somebody come and get me out of this? Somebody? Anybody? I have to get rid of those bones or they'll tear down our house. Ohh! [panting] Help! [clang!] -[motorcycles buzz by] -[siren wailing] [Garfield sighing] [clang!] -Odie! You dug up an entire dinosaur. -Mm-hmm. You did as I asked, boy, and that's great. -There's just one more thing to do. -What? -Bury them all again. -No! [Garfield] No, there's no time. This is awful. I should have given you that second rib bone instead of sending you out to dig here. [Odie whines] What do you mean you never got the first one? -I gave it to you. -No! What? Hercules stole it? That little sawed-off Chihuahua down the block? [Odie] Mm-hmm. [Garfield] This could work out just fine. [snarling] Oh, yes! Hey, what's haps there, Hercules? If you've come to take the bone back, I'm not giving it to you. I stole it fair and squares! Oh no, you can keep it. Odie doesn't bother with those tiny bones anymore. This is not a tiny bone. It is a good size bone. Oh, you think so, huh? Come on. Look at the kind of bone Odie's been digging up at our place. You can keep any of those tiny bones. Who needs them? I have to take Odie for a walk. So I hope nobody steals his new bones while we're gone. Can it be? It's true, it's true. The largest, most beautiful bones I have ever seen. [straining] I don't care how many trips I make. These bones will be all mine! [siren wailing] [car doors open] [close] [doorbell rings] Hold on, I just got home this minute. What is it you wanna do? It's what we are going to do. We're having your home declared a site of vital scientific interest. We're going to tear down the whole house and dig for dinosaur bones. Dinosaur bones? There are no dinosaur bones here. There are. Your cat had one. -Wanna see where the dinosaur bones are? -You want us to follow you, cat? There are your dino bones, lady. My word! Those are Brachiosaurus bones. Forget about Mr. Arbuckle's property. Let's tear this house down and dig! I don't know how you do it, Garfield. I don't know how I do it, either. Come on, boy. Let's get home and see if there are any ribs left. You can have the bone, and I'll take all the meat stuff they stick on the outside. [slurps] Lunch will be ready in a few minutes. I made beef stew! -[toy squeaks] -Ooops! -[clang!] -[toy squeaks] Odie, you left one of your doggie toys out again. -[Odie whimpers] -[toy squeaks] This is not the first time, Odie. And if it isn't you leaving doggie toys around, it's Garfield and his supper dishes. Whoa! [crash!] Like that one. If you'd fill them more often, I wouldn't leave them out where you trip over them. -Guys, you have to pick up after yourself. -[doorbell rings] Oh, now, who could that be? I sometimes feel like I spend half my life picking up after my pets. Yes? Good day, sir. Do you feel like you spend half your life picking up after your pets? I just said that. Well, I have just the answer to your problem. Behold, the all-new, rechargeable, digital-drive, robotic, custodial marvel of the ages, the TI-D 7000! It's a robot. Not just a robot, sir. A robot that can keep your home sparkling clean, neat, and immaculate. [Garfield] Jon's right. I know it doesn't happen often, but Jon's right. We are getting the house messy. He shouldn't be the one to pick up all this stuff. Right! Let me know when you get done. I'm gonna make a sandwich. Huh? Let me give you a little demonstration. I'll set the robot to clean up after pets. [beeping, whirring] [sensors beeping] [vacuum roaring] [Odie whining] This is gonna be a sandwich of historic proportions. First, the bread. Now I need something good to put between the two slices of bread. Like maybe... everything. Here we go. That'll do for a start. Now, let's see, I just... Wait. That's funny. I thought I had some bread out. [gasps] Ahem. Huh? Hmm. All right, you overgrown toaster oven. Give me back my sandwich or else. [robot whirring rapidly] On second thought, keep the sandwich. I'm going out for a pizza. [Garfield screaming] [vacuum roaring] [sensors beeping] Hey! Hey! Put me down! Stop! Let me out of here! [banging sides] I don't wanna be in here! I can't stand being in here! Here's my sandwich. [crunch] -This is pretty good. -[Odie whining] [Garfield] Oh, hi, Odie. No, you can't have any of my sandwich. [both] Huh? Yeow! Do you have any idea what just happened to us? -Uh-uh. -No, me neither. Let's find out so we can make it never happen again. Just sign here, Mr. Arbuckle, and the TI-D 7000 will be yours for just 7,000 easy payments. First, I want to see how it worked. Very nice. Very nice. I can't recall my living room ever looking this good. So is it a deal, Mr. Arbuckle? Just sign here, and the robot will be cleaning your house every hour of every day. No! Please don't buy that robot. Please don't buy that robot. Please don't buy that robot. Did I say you shouldn't buy that robot? [Odie, yipping] Please don't buy that robot, don't buy that robot. No! Well, Mr. Arbuckle, you bought yourself a robot. Here's the instruction manual. It has a money-back guarantee. I'll check back with you later and see how it's working for you. You two won't be messing up the house any longer. -Yeah, because we won't survive. -[Odie whimpers] I never read instruction manuals. [robot whirring] [stomach rumbling] -Shh! -[vacuum whirring] Ptooey! Yum, yum! [steel "hands" clanking] [crunching] [cereal clangs] [alarm sounding] [whirring, buzzing] [gasps] [sensors beeping] I don't suppose I could convince you I was a jar of raspberry preserves? Aaaah! [vacuum whirring, "hand" clanking] Help! [screams] Whoa! [Garfield sighs] [Garfield] In here again! Well, maybe Odie will get me out. -[Odie whines] -So much for that "maybe." -[Odie yips] -Odie, old pal. -We have to do something about this robot. -[whirring resumes] [both screaming] The question is, what to do? Do you have any ideas? No, you never have any ideas. Why am I even asking? [Odie] I don't ever know. Odie! That's the instruction manual for the robot. Maybe you did have an idea and didn't know it. [Odie] I did? Okay, I think I have it. We just need someone to distract that bucket of bolts. Odie, old friend... [blows raspberry] [screaming] [steel "hands" clanking] [alarm whirring] [Garfield] Whoo-hoo! Yaaaa! Let's see, reprogramming sequence. [screaming] [Odie muttering] [panting] Okay, I changed the programming. Instead of cleaning up after pets, it's now going to clean up after pet owners. [chuckles] [thud!] [beeping] Ahh! [alarm sounding] Hey, not me, robot. You're supposed to clean up after the cat and dog, not me! You're not supposed to chase me. I own you! It's my house! -I'm allowed to get it dirty! -Let's see how Jon likes it. Not me! Them! Not me! Whoa! [crash!] -[vacuum whirring] -[thud!] Stop! It tickles! Don't! Somebody turn it off! So, what do you think, Odie? Shall we turn it off? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Help! Help! I'm clean! I'm clean! Honest, I'm clean! Okay? [robot powers down] I'm sorry, guys. I didn't realize what it would do. It's that salesman's fault. He should have warned me about that thing. Well... I have an idea about him. [doorbell rings] Mr. Arbuckle? I'm here to see how things are going with the TI-D 7000. Hey! Where's this mud coming from? This is awful. How am I going to get clean? Stop! No! No! I designed you! You can't turn on me! No. Help! Nice work, Garfield. -You reprogrammed it to... -Clean sleazy salespeople. There are a lot of them, you know. I'll get rid of that robot and get my money back and... My money back! I have to get Mr. Sellers to give me my money back! Oh, Mr. Sellers! Robot! Come back! Come on, Odie. Let's go in and dirty up the place. Right.
