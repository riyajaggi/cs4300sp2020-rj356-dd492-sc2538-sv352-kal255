 -[Garfield snoring] -[alarm rings] [upbeat theme song playing] -[Garfield] Hee-hee! -[remote clicks] [kids chatting, laughing] [boy] Hey, you guys, look at this. [doorbell rings] Oh, boy. Not more trick-or-treaters. There's something I don't like about Halloween. Maybe it's giving perfectly good candy away to total strangers, instead of me eating it. - Trick or treat! - Trick or treat!

 Here's one for you, and one for you, and one for you. Here's one for me, and one for me, and one for me. Peppermint. [door slams] Now make sure you don't eat all the candy, Garfield. Leave some for the trick-or-treaters. Hey, the bowl's empty. The candy is all gone. Gee, I wonder where it all went. [gulp] Oh, I'd better go out and buy some more. First, dinner. Then you go out and buy some more. [doorbell rings] [Jon] More trick-or-treaters! Garfield, get the door. - Trick or treat! - Or wash your feet! Sorry. All out of candy. Come back next year.

 Garfield, that's mean. Open the door and give them something we don't need. [Odie yips] Here. We don't need this. -[Odie] Huh? -Garfield, you can't give Odie away. The only candy we have left is this old taffy you didn't eat last Halloween. -[yipping] -Don't touch any of it. Don't worry. There are some things in the world even I won't eat, and stale taffy is most of them. Ah! This is the night for free goodies. All I need is a costume. Let's see now... Hey, Odie, what should I go as? [Odie yips] Besides an overweight pussycat. The scarier the costume, the more treats you get. Now let's see, what can I dress as that will be really scary? I'm coming to you live from the zoo where visitors are flocking to see what may well be the scariest creature... Scariest? He's Catzilla, a rare and near descendant of the prehistoric saber-toothed tiger. Everyone seems very afraid of him. Which might mean they'll give him lots and lots of candy. [wolf howls] Jon won't mind if I use his paint. And the reason he won't mind is, he won't know. Where's that toy walrus Jon won at the carnival ring toss game last year? Mind if I borrow these? Of course you don't. You're a toy. Now I need to capture that savage Catzilla look. [snarls] No, no good. If I'm gonna look really mean, I'll have to think of something to make me look really hostile. I'm sorry, kitty cat. We have no more pepperoni for your pizza. How about some nice raisins? No, more hostile than that. Come on, Garfield! Let's do some aerobic exercises, then we'll eat nothing but lettuce for a month. Not quite. It's got to be something to make me truly hostile. Hiya, Garfield! Yes, it's me, Nermal! I'm coming to live with you and I'm gonna sleep in your bed. Ohh! That's it! Now, to the treats! Let's see the news. Before we go, let's take one last look at Catzilla. We can't get too close to this fierce beast because... Where's the fierce beast? Where's Catzilla? He's gone! Catzilla has escaped! [crowd screaming] Aah! We'd better lock the doors! We're not far from the zoo! [Odie whimpering] [Garfield] Hope they have peanut brittle. Hope they have peanut brittle. Hope, hope... [woman] Oh, this is terrible! That beast is loose! Maybe I'd better warn the trick-or-treaters to get inside! Did you see the news? They said... -[snarls] -[shrieks] Pretty good. Hey, no peanut brittle. [woman] That's right, Catzilla! He's on this street! Send help at once! -[snarls] -[shrieks] Catzilla! Another good haul. But no peanut brittle. Of course I recognized him! It was Catzilla! Right here on my street! [screams] What is it with these people? Don't they know how popular peanut brittle is? It was Catzilla, I'm sure of it! I was just watching the TV news report of how he escaped from the zoo! [wolf howls] [Garfield] Let's see, 23 houses, 23 bowls of candy. Total amount of peanut brittle? Zero. Maybe I'll have better luck at the next 23 houses. -[man] There he is! Right there! -[sirens wailing] [helicopter hovering] We have you surrounded! He's making a break for it! After him! [Garfield gasping] He's hopping the fence! Get the light on him! Hey, do I tell everybody what you're up to? Hiding place, hiding place. - Let's just find him. - No sign of him back here. When they catch him, they're gonna ship him to a zoo in Siberia. Siberia? All I wanted was some peanut brittle. -I have to get home. I'll be safer there. -[Catzilla snarls] Almost there. Almost there. [teeth chattering] We have reports that Catzilla has been sighted on the west side. [Odie whimpering] He is extremely dangerous and everyone is warned to watch for him. [Odie] Yowp! "Yowp" is right! [Garfield] Uh... It's Catzilla! [banging on door] Police, this is Jon Arbuckle! Catzilla is on my front porch! Hurry! [man] Don't let him get away! Come on! I'm registered. You can't do that. Take your hands off me, I'm a registered cat. Good work. We'll get him back to the zoo right away. [door clangs] You guys have it all wrong. I'm not Catzilla! I live in there. [Catzilla snickers] There! There's Catzilla, see, there! He's sneaking into our house! Whew! That was close. [Odie] Mm-hmm! Imagine the terror and the danger of having Catzilla in our home. Let me out. Get me an attorney! Get me an attorney named Murray! I'm not Catzilla! He's in my house, about to chomp the puppy and that guy who cooks my lasagna! I gotta get out of here. It's open at the top. Maybe if I climb out... I can do it. I can do it. Yaaaah! I can't do it. Maybe I can pry the bars open. [straining] I give up. I'm not a superhero. I'm not a bodybuilder. I'm just a flabby, out-of-shape pussycat. Hey! I'm a flabby, out-of-shape pussycat. Yoo-hoo! Anybody! I shouldn't be in here! Hello? You shouldn't be in there! You're not Catzilla! - You're a flabby, out-of-shape pussycat! - You noticed. Where's Catzilla? I know where Catzilla is, and I've got to get home before he goes trick-or-treating, with Odie and Jon as the treats. Some fruit, Odie? [slurps] -Gee, you were hungry. -[Odie] Hmm? [Jon] I'll get some more snacks. Where is that light switch? Hey, how come the light switch is all furry? [Catzilla snarls] Aaaah! [snarling] - Catzilla! - Jon! Odie! Catzilla's in the house! Oh, you've noticed. Yaaaaaa! Help! [clang!] [snarling] -[Jon screams] -[Catzilla snickers] [Garfield] Help! Maybe we can give him something to eat, like Jon's car or something. [teeth chattering] Wait! I know! Quick, Odie. Open up these wrappers of taffy. [snarling] Here, fella. Trick or treat! Mmm! Having trouble chewing, fella? Well, I don't think you'll be biting anyone for a while. There he is! There's Catzilla! Be careful with him, men! [snarling] - [Jon] Bet you're glad to have him back. - We sure are. Say, it's feeding time. When I'm around, it's always feeding time. The Catzilla has quite an appetite. Each meal, he gets ten steaks, ten cans of salmon, a roast beef or two, a dozen lasagnas, and for dessert, and you might think this is odd, his favorite thing, peanut brittle. It's wonderful! Peanut brittle? What are we waiting for? It's feeding time! Mind if I join you for dinner, smiley? [snoring] [Odie yipping] [yipping continues] [Garfield] No, Odie, it's too late to play ball. Ahh! This dog never learns. Fine, let's play my favorite game. Go fetch. And sleep outside. [whines] [Jon snoring] [Garfield] Whew! [sighs] [Odie whimpering] [object whirring] [boom!] Ohh! Shake the house all you like, I ain't getting up to let you in, Odie. [metal creaking] [Odie yelps] Huh?! [console beeping] The Xantium Repulsor's missing! If I don't find it, I'll never make it before the Saturnian rush hour! [Odie barks] There it is! That curious quadruped life form has really saved the day. How could I possibly repay you, strange Earthling? [energy pulsing] [alien] Hmm. Seems like this selfish, lasagna-devouring orange creature has it pretty easy. It is time to turn the tables and make things right. The deed is done! [sawing, whirring, hammering] [engine starts] [spaceship revs] [whirring] [rooster crows] [snoring] -[slurping] -Odie, stop it! [panting, barking] Garfield? Very funny. You almost had me for a moment. [Garfield whimpering] Where is Odie anyway? [sighs, sniffs] [Garfield's voice] Where is that dreadful stench coming from? [sniffing] Ewww! Barf. What's with the doggy breath? I'd better go brush my teeth. How did I end up here? I must have been sleepwalking. Ah! There you are, Odie! Come on in! Breakfast is ready. Wow! He still can't get my name right. After all these years. [sniffing] Mmm! Lasagna, yummy. Hold it right there. If he's Garfield, then who am I? This can't be! Aaah! Odie and I have swapped bodies. Which means that Odie's eating my lasagna! There you go, Odie. Yikes! No wonder Odie's breath is so unpleasant. I'm not eating that. Back off, Odie. Those lasagnas are mine. [snarling] Right! Let's not panic now. Let's just... [screams] [thud!] Odie, are you trying to tell me something? Yes! Yes! Yes! Jon! Jon! It's me, Garfield! I'm trapped in Odie's body! Do something! Oh, I get it, Odie! You need some exercise! [gasps] [yelps] [yelping] [straining] What's the matter, Odie? Can't breathe. Must be a nightmare. That's it! Wake up, Garfield. Wake up. I don't believe this! Odie's watching my favorite TV show in my favorite seat. In my body! [wails] Come on, Odie. Let's run another couple of blocks. I've had enough sport for a lifetime. Arlene, it's me, Garfield! Yeah, right. And I'm the queen of England. Arlene, wait! I'm really Garfield and I can prove it. Last year, I accidentally ate all your birthday cake. And remember, I fell asleep in front of the TV on our first date. Thanks for bringing back such good memories. What on earth are you doing in Odie's body? Hey, you tell me. Maybe that's what you get for being mean to Odie. You're right. I always treated him like a dog, and now I am one. Oh, cheer up, Garfield. Think of all the things you can do now that you're a dog. Like what? Run after my tail all day and drink out of a toilet? Hey, Arlene. Hey, Odie. Isn't it an awesome day ? You know what, Arlene? You may have a point. -[snarling] -[Nermal screaming] Hey, this is fun. [sighs] [shrieks] [sniffing] Odie, are you insane? These dogs have a death wish on me! Odie, come back here. Garfield, this is your one and final mistake. -[snarls] -[yelp] -[barking] -Leave me... Leave him alone. Odie, what's your problem? You're protecting Garfield? Yeah, can you think of one nice thing that feline ever did for you? One nice thing? -[barking] -One nice thing which... No. [snarling] Wha...! [chomp!] My lucky bone! Odie! Bad dog... cat? [dogs barking] Now, hush. Stay where you are, okay? [barks] -[clang!] -[birds chirping] Which way did that cat go? Wait. How do we know you're telling the truth? I swear. Dog's honor! [barking] Wow. That was hairy. Come on, Odie, let's go home. Odie? Odie! Where are you, you miserable-- Odie, no! Yaaaaa! This could be my lucky day. Ugh! The day I finally get rid of that pesky vermin once and for all. Yeah, I'm sending you to Ougadougou. Help! Someone call the cops! That psycho postman stole my body! [shrieking] Odie, are you in there? [muffled barking] Dogs' claws are so dull. Hey! What do you think you're doing? Another example of cats' immense superiority over dogs. Dogs don't land gracefully on four feet. There he is! [car horn blares] Just hang in there, Odie! [clang!] A laptop? I just risked my life for a laptop? Where'd that stupid cat go? Come back here, you four-legged thief! Oh, boy. Buddy! Wait! This way! -[dogs snarling] -Not good. This way! Come back here, you orange nuisance! [Garfield's voice] Not that way, Odie! This way! -[dogs snarling] -No way out. This is it, Odie. For what it's worth, I'm sorry for being mean to you, old friend. Goodbye, Odie. [spaceship beeping] I'd better check how my quadruped friend is doing. [gasps] By Saturn's rings! -[dogs snarling] -[Garfield's voice] Help! [spaceship beeping] I guess I shouldn't have interfered in the first place. Let's fix this mess before it gets ugly. [gasping] -[ship hatch clangs open] -[energy pulsing] [Garfield's voice] My delicate whiskers. My wonderful orange fur. I'm me again! I'm Garfield! -At least things are back to normal. -[postman shrieks, dogs snarl] All things considered, the chair's big enough for two, isn't it, Odie? [Odie yips]
