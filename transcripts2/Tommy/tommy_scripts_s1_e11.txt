 Previously on "Tommy..." - Whose house is this? - A friend. How was the house? You had a good time last night? - You going there? - I'm just asking if you enjoyed the use of my residence. It's Lovell. You know what he knows. What he could do to us. I'd like you to move on to a different subject of investigation. Blake, right? I collect private intelligence.

 I wouldn't want you to get in any trouble, Blake. I was threatened last night. I'm having an affair with the mayor. And this man had pictures. - Is there more? - Yes. I have asked for an ethics inquiry as to whether or not Chief Thomas has violated the city's conflict of interest rules by providing information to sports agent Kiley Mills about the Jovani Perez case. According to a fire department spokesman, the fire spread quickly after starting earlier this evening. Firefighters say the blaze already covers

 over 100 acres in the hills above Hollywood, which is just five percent contained. Chief Thomas. How's it going? We've got every available unit up there. Haven't made a dent. Any idea how it started? Well, with the rain we've had, ground cover's still too wet for a natural cause. Maybe a cookfire in a homeless encampment. All right, we have all our people on, uh, traffic control, evacuations. You need anything else, you let us know. Thanks. You don't see that on Long Island. You don't. Thank you. Hey. Wait here. Mr. Mayor. - Not even a phone call? - Talk tomorrow, Tommy. There's a lot going on. Yes, I can see that. But unless you got a-a big hat and a fire hose, I think you can spare me a minute. What's up? I had to find out on the news that I'm under an ethics investigation? Whoa. Look... No. Whoa. I know you have a phone. I saw you just using it. Tommy, I didn't create this situation. You did. - I did? How? - By making it appear... and I emphasize "appear"... that you were using your office to help your friend, the sports agent. Now, everything's got to be transparent. No back channels. Back channel? How 'bout a phone call? You-you don't think I did anything wrong. You're making too much of this. It's an issue of perception. Okay? It looks like you did something wrong, so now a whole big show has to be made of looking into it. It's theater. Just go through the process. You're gonna be fine. No, feels like more than a show. Tommy, it's politics. All right? It's exactly what it appears to be, - no more, no less. - Ever since I got to L.A., nothing has been as it appears to be. What can I tell you? Welcome to our fair city. I heard you talked to the boss. How much did you tell her? Everything. The mayor? Yeah. Everything. Oh. Well, it got her attention, because she wants us in her office now. Really looking forward to that. Did you sleep here last night? Uh, yeah. I was, uh, too scared to go home. Go to a hotel. That feels less safe than my apartment. Then why don't you just come to my place? I have a spare bedroom. You can stay as long as you want. I offer this as a brother. That's really sweet of you, Ken. I appreciate it. Uh, quick question. When was the last time that you cleaned your bathroom? My... W-Well... See, if you have to think about it, it's too long. Thank you so much, but I'm good. Let's go. Okay. I want you all to hear some things that Blake told me about yesterday. And for the moment, what she says stays in this room. Is that clear? Okay. Blake? Um... some of you know Vincent Siano. Metro reporter. Kind of a friend. A little while ago, Vincent told me he was looking into the death of Arturo Lopez. That guy that got killed in jail. - Friend of the mayor. - Right. Vincent asked me to get some information related to the death, and I did. And then he disappeared. Disappeared how? He never showed up to collect the information. I haven't heard from him since. W-When I started looking for him, I-I felt like I was being followed. And I-I thought I was being paranoid. Then, um, two nights ago, this thug came to my apartment and threatened me. Threatened you with what? Personal information. The-the details don't matter. It-It's private. The point is that this man was trying to blackmail me. What information did Siano want? The autopsy report for Edward Wilson, the last victim of the Crenshaw Fireman. What did he have to do with Arturo Lopez? Who's the Crenshaw Fireman? He's a serial killer we locked up a little while ago. "Crenshaw" because most of the bodies were found along Crenshaw Boulevard. "Fireman" because he burned his victims. But what does he have to do with Arturo Lopez? Hold on. There's more. The evidence this guy was using to blackmail me, I think it came from Jonathan Lovell. - The developer? - Okay. So we got a dead friend of the mayor's, the most powerful developer in the city, a serial killer, and a missing reporter. Oh, as much fun as a cop could ask for, huh? I mean, there's a lot of holes in this. There's more holes than anything. I want you to look into Siano. What did he find out, what happened to him... anything you can learn. But keep it quiet. I don't want a formal investigation just yet. You got it. Answer any questions Diaz has and then walk away. I don't want you anywhere near this thing from now on. That's okay by me. Cooper, stay on the fires. Ken, I need some help, uh, getting ready for this, uh, ethics hearing. Terry Simmons from Legal Counsel is gonna help me prep. - I want you in on that. - Sure thing. And, remember, what you just heard stays in this room. Some advice? What? Don't do this on the down-low. Open up a missing persons file. Start a formal investigation. This is no time for secrets. Everything Blake just described, that didn't sound like a cover-up to you? Maybe. One that might even explain this ethics thing I'm suddenly having to deal with? Not impossible, I'll grant you. And the people behind this, you think they don't have contacts in the LAPD, ones that they would call the second they hear we've opened a case file? Maybe. But that's a few people. You can trust the department as a whole. You have to right now. Do I? Or you have to make them believe that you do. Someone has been following me. You've seen the pictures. Now they are threatening Blake. Who knows what they did to this journalist? This does not feel like a missing persons investigation. This feels like a war. This is about Vincent Siano? Yeah. We got a concerned friend who filed a report. Probably nothing. Since you're his, uh, editor, I was wondering if, uh, you knew where he might be. Either chasing a woman or chasing a story. Beyond that, no. You haven't seen him recently? Not for a couple of days. He doesn't spend much time at his desk. Did he tell you what he was working on? Uh, city corruption was what he said. That covers a lot of ground. Vincent is a tease. He doesn't like to offer too much detail when he's pitching a story. It's more annoying than anything else. But... he's done it before, so... Disappeared before? Vincent is a good reporter. He's just a little too fond of the drama. He's young yet. He'll mellow out. Look, Vincent will show up with a bombshell. Just you watch. Or at least something he'll try and convince me is a bombshell. I'm not worried, if that's what you're asking. I can now confirm that the Bantam Trail blaze is 35% contained. Firefighters are battling a second blaze that broke out south of it. No casualties have been reported. Questions? When will Chief Thomas address the pending ethics charges against her? Uh, the chief has issued a statement. I don't expect any further discussion - on her part. - So she denies using her office to curry favor with friends? There's nothing in the ethics committee investigation - to suggest that she... - Blake, there are several specific allegations that do point... I'm not getting into the weeds on this, Todd. Any questions about the investigation, I refer you to the chief's statement. In the meantime, there's a fire spanning 200 acres, threatening lives and homes in the Hollywood Hills. Does anyone have a question about that? Uh, how was the briefing? I felt like a piñata up there. This hearing can't come fast enough. Uh, you-you got a few minutes? I want to see if a sketch artist can help us I.D. the guy who threatened you. Uh, sure. Ken. Terry Simmons, Office of Legal Counsel. - Hey. - Hi. So, I was just explaining the commission granted our request for the expedited hearing. They're holding it 48 hours from now. - Okay. - So, what do we need to do? Well, they'll provide questions. You submit written responses. They investigate, and then they'll give a recommendation to the Police Commission. Do I have to answer in writing? Can't I just talk to them? It's not customary. So what? You could do it, but it's a risk. Why? This is not a legal proceeding. There's no judge overseeing it. No spectators, even, except for a few invited officials. - So? - So there are, effectively, no rules; I mean, the commission can ask anything it wants. And you have no legal rights, except to refuse to answer, which would defeat the purpose of being there. I don't care. I would rather speak to them in person. I have nothing to hide. All right. Let's find out. Mind a few questions? No. Shoot. So, you're accused of using your position here in the department to benefit your friend, Kylie Mills. Please tell us how long you've known Ms. Mills and the precise nature of your... friendship. Okay. He had, uh, darker eyes. More circles under them. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, like that. Any facial hair? No, he was clean-shaven. Piercings? Scars? Tattoos? No, nothing like that. Um, bushier eyebrows, maybe? Okay. That him? Yeah. That's pretty close. Uh... - Thanks, Lenny. - Yep. - Thank you. - Oh, you're welcome. - What? - Nothing. I'll, uh, run this through some programs, see if any matches come up. It's a start, anyway. Okay. It's Coop. We need to talk. What up?! So corny. What you doin'? Keeping tabs on the units that are supporting the fire department. Damn. In New York, you know your dangers... taxi drivers, subway rats. But here in L.A., it gets biblical. - Yeah. - Listen... can you do a dive on somebody without going through official channels? What kind of dive? Phone records, e-mails, credit card transactions, basic stuff. Is this for a case, or is it personal? It's for the boss. Missing person. Journalist named Vincent Siano. Get me a warrant, I'll look into it. That's the thing. It's kind of a no-warrant type of case. I can't do much without a warrant. Phone company won't release data, for one, so... There's no way around that? Let me think about it. - So you were intimate with Ms. Mills? - Yes. Did you discuss department matters then? Did I discuss cop business in bed? What kind of question is that? The kind you need to be ready to answer. You can always deflect with humor. - Or not. - Did you ever discuss official police business with Ms. Mills when you were intimate? No. There was the time I read aloud from the revised security manual by moonlight, though. - Does that count? - That's funny. We can soften it. Are you still in an intimate relationship with her? I don't think so. You don't "think so"? I mean no, I am not. - Why not? - What? Why are you and Ms. Mills no longer intimately involved? How is that pertinent to this case? Okay, maybe, um... So, just please, answer this question. What caused you two to break up? Was it the Jovani Perez case? Did that... figure into your decision? No. No? What was it, then? What was what? Why are you and Ms. Mills no longer intimately involved? There must be some specific reason. What is it? This is not about my personal life. This is about... Oh, so you don't want to answer the question? Do you know how that's gonna look? I don't care. And there is no way that these are the types of questions I'm gonna be asked - at-at an ethics hearing. - That's-that's enough for now. - We can pick this up later. - Fine. Just tell me when. We don't have much time. You okay, boss? No, I need a minute. Sure. Hey. What am I missing? Nothing. Let me see. Yo. It's nothing, I said. I could use a good laugh. Let me see. No. Show me the phone. I'm not showing you. Bro, show me the phone. No, I'm not showing you the phone. Ma'am? - Yeah? - Diaz asked me to look into a case, Vincent Siano, sort of unofficially. He said it was coming from you. - I just wanted to be sure. - Yeah, it is. Oh. Good. I was worried he was, you know, asking me to run his ex's new boyfriend or something. People ask for things like that sometimes. No. But, uh, it's good you checked. Of course. Um, could I say something? You thought I could run the IT department when I didn't even think I could do that. That was, like, everything. Thank you for that. I think it's crazy what they're doing to you. - I would do anything I can to help. - Thanks. And yes, help Diaz, but don't do anything - that'll get you into trouble, okay? - Okay. Chief. Excuse me. I think you need to step out here. Say it again! Say it again! Say it again! I want you to! Stay out of my face, man, I'm telling you. Telling me what?! What are you telling me? Whoa! What the hell's going on? Nobody has work to do? Get back to where you're supposed to be. Go. Diaz, with me. Explain yourself, and it better be good, 'cause I am in no mood for this crap today. - Are you texting? - I'm not. They were... they were looking at this thing. What thing? Is that supposed to be me? Yeah. They-they were goofing on it. I got mad. I'm sorry. There's no excuse. I know. Yeah, I talked about this. I miss something? Nope. See me later. I just heard from the FD about the fire. - They got it contained? - Well, they're getting there, but they found a body. First casualty that we know of. Well, I hate to hear that. Yeah, the thing is, they think it was doused with an accelerant, probably gasoline. They think that's what started it? That's what it looks like. Not just a fire anymore. Oh, could be a homicide. Ken, what is this? Hillary Clinton... at the Benghazi hearings in 2015. Dark jacket. Crisp lapels. Gold jewelry. Her hair is... nice and helmet-y. - It's called a blowout. - Oh. You are my speechwriter; you are not my stylist. Well, they're kind of one and the same. What you look like affects how people hear you. Did any of these women win? Hillary Clinton won the popular vote. Mm. How'd that work out? Here's the British prime minister, Theresa May, looking simple, sensible. And where is she these days? Look, Ken, I will be fine. I will wear what I always wear. It's just... what they are putting you through is so massively unfair. It's wrong, and it makes me mad. I just wanted to do something, and... this is what I came up with. Thank you, Ken. And stop worrying. I am a cop; I will wear my uniform. Uniform. Classic. What can you tell us about the fire victim? Uh, nothing yet. The medical examiner's office has scheduled an autopsy... that's all we know. - This is still a John or a Jane Doe? - That's right. There's a rumor that the victim is a white male in his 30s. - Can you confirm? - Uh, definitely not. I don't know where that would have come from. Um, guys, I got to go. Hey. Ashley Kim found something you should see. Since they think the fire was arson, we started checking nature cams in the hills to see if they got a shot of the person who started it. Nature cams? Remote cameras set up to study wildlife. They turn on whenever animals walk past. And... people. The people you see are mostly homeless or kids making out, but then I noticed this guy, not far from where the fire started. - What about him? - Diaz showed me a drawing of the guy you saw. Is that him? I think it is. Yeah... I think that might be the guy. This was before the fire started? According to the time code. That's a pretty fuzzy picture. No, it's him. He killed Vincent. Why would you say that? Uh, a reporter just told me that the body they found in the fire was a white male in his 30s. It's Vincent. I just know it. We don't know anything yet. No, it's him. I have to go. Len Egan. Coop. Good to see you. What's up? We've been, uh, tracking this guy who's been doing some sophisticated surveillance cop stuff. I got a drawing. He remind you of anybody? Should it? Knock it off. That's Howie Ford, who I know has been working for you since he got kicked off the force. Come to think of it, it does look a bit like Howie. Is he tailing the chief for you? Taking pictures of her, scaring the living daylights out of my comm director? 'Cause I got issues with that. Well, to be honest, it's a somewhat complicated situation. Answer the question. You trust me, Coop? Why do you ask? I was with the department 22 years. A lot of that time was spent with you. We worked together. - We made some collars, didn't we? - Sure. So you should trust me when I say this is a good day for you. In fact, I was gonna call you when you called me. What are you talking about, Len? You're a dealmaker, a diplomat. People see it. You have admirers you don't even know. You want to meet some of them? 'Cause they want to meet you. Come on. Ah, there he is. Hey, Donn. - Chief Leakey. - Hey. This is Jonathan Lovell. - He's... - I know who Mr. Lovell is. We're sorry to blindside you like this... so rude. Sit. - Scotch? - I'm good. What's, uh, this about? What's going on down at headquarters, Coop, is shameful. What part of it? Eh, she's a nice girl... not my cup of tea... but a nice girl. In over her head. That grant money she blew chasing that Arab... The Norah Fayed case? That resulted in a homicide collar. You bagged the kid. Blew $7 million. Is that good for the department? Money I got by going to D.C. and strapping my kneepads on. She threw it away. That's not leadership. She couldn't get a budget passed to get more cops. And that BS with that D... Dominican ballplayer. Giving a kid with an illegal weapon a walk? I almost had a heart attack. He's Mexican, that-that kid. I know how you feel about guns on the street. Would you have let that kid skate? I'm not the chief. And there we come to the point. She never understood the job, Coop. She can't relate to the guys, guys can't relate to her. She was bad for the department, bad for the city. She's going down. It's her own making. She's going down, or she's being taken down? I wish we had the power to be some kind of cabal, but we are just three men. Three concerned citizens who recognize an unsustainable situation. I see. After she's gone, someone's gonna take her place. As her deputy, you'll fill in temporarily, of course, but who's gonna be her permanent replacement? The department's gonna need someone with a strong hand to steady the ship. Someone with experience and gravitas. Someone who commands respect. If you couldn't tell, we're talking about you. So, how's that make you feel? You deserve the chair. We both know you've earned it. Hell, I would've... I would've told 'em to give it to you back then if anyone had asked. Does the mayor know about this? The mayor will not object. Oh, God. What? Oh, nothing. What are you doing? Are you reading the comments? Tomorrow morning, Blake has me calling in to a radio show, I guess to be proactive or something. I thought I should know what people are saying. Since when do you care what people think anyways? You know, it's not what people think. It's what I think. I mean... how could I let this happen? What do you mean? I know. I should have thought about this. I-I should have been ahead of it, 'cause if I'm not ahead of it, then I'm behind. I don't have a normal job. - To think that I compromised... - You didn't. - Well, I never should have... - What, dated someone? You can't have a private life because you're the chief of police? That's crazy. Every night, before I left your father, I would look in the mirror and say to myself, "Really? "You are gonna leave your family, break everything up because you feel something?" You wanted to be true to yourself. But people make sacrifices. That's just the way it works. And I should have known that in this job, I can't have a personal life. You shouldn't have to make sacrifices because people are homophobic and sexist. And racist, for that matter. Yeah, I would love to live in that world, honey, but I don't. I live in this one. Mom, I-I know you don't like to think of yourself as a pioneer. I'm just a cop. I'm just trying to be a cop. But you are a pioneer. My God, this investigation, the cartoon. My private life being all over the news. It's just so... - Just... - When I... when I was a kid, you used to tell me that lies are complicated, but the truth is simple. So just go into that hearing and tell them the truth. You remember that? Of course. Despite everything, I did decide to leave your father, so, I guess I wanted you to know I meant it. And that was embattled LAPD Chief Abigail Thomas. Chief, thanks for sharing with our listeners. Of course. You're welcome. And at KFBP Los Angeles, it's five before the hour. You were great on the air. Well, any opportunity to talk about my personal life with strangers. You projected total confidence and positivity. It couldn't have gone any better. Well, hopefully, the Ethics Commission was listening. No, this wasn't for them. This was to win the war of public opinion. You translate great to radio. I'm gonna book a few more. Okay. Chief? Yeah. We have a problem. Okay. Come on in. Mr. Taylor? Detective, I know I said that I wasn't worried about Vincent, but, uh, something's happened that I think you should know about. Why am I only now hearing about the Day Glow Spa? What about it? Did you make sure that your son-in-law wasn't prosecuted when he was identified as a john in a prostitution sting investigation? No, I did no such thing. Chief. I discovered my son-in-law was on a list of offenders. I did nothing to intervene. The case went on as it would have had I not known. Your son-in-law was being investigated for a sex crime, and you... And I did nothing. Despite my concerns for my daughter. Did it occur to you that one of your people might have taken matters into their own hands? Nobody knew it was my son-in-law. We have different names. I told one person... Donn Cooper... who also did nothing. Well, I'm hearing otherwise. - From who? - From the Ethics Commission. Who on the Ethics Commission? It doesn't matter. Could Cooper have talked to them? No. Nah, I... I don't think so. Santos, the head of Vice... he put this case together. He will confirm everything I've said. Be sure your story's straight on this. We're gonna have a lot to answer for. When did this happen? Just an hour ago. The Rwandan diplomat was sitting there for 30 minutes before someone finally figured that they were there to see Vincent. But Vincent never showed up. And it's unusual for Vincent to miss a meeting? Unheard of. Look, I know I said that Vincent was unreliable, and it's true, interpersonally, but as a reporter, Vincent would never blow off a meeting. Thank you. Please let me know if you hear anything else. You're not the only one worried about Siano. What do we do? When was the last time you're sure you got a message from him? A couple days ago, he texted me to meet him at a bar. Let's go check something out. Someone is saying that I pulled strings to get my son-in-law off the list of johns that you put together? I have no idea where that came from. When you brought that case to me, we didn't even discuss my son-in-law. That's right. Did you even know who he was, or that he was on the list? No. Where is this information coming from? Someone else in Vice? No one else dealt with it. Did you tell anyone? Yeah, one person. Maybe you should talk to him. Boss, got a minute? Yeah. All right. Thanks, Santos. What now? The editor wasn't worried, but now he is? - That's right. - And we think we have a picture of the guy who was following Blake near where the fire started. That's not much of a picture. You're sure that's him? That's him. That's the guy who threatened me. So that's what we got? Siano texted Blake to meet him at 9:00 a couple days ago. I asked Ashley to check the cameras around his apartment building. She found this. There's Vincent heading to his car right before he was supposed to meet Blake. He's talking to someone. Six minutes later, his phone shut off. It turned on again two hours later, briefly. That's when someone texted me in the apartment, pretending to be him. Then it turned off for good. We think he was grabbed, killed, and then the guy took the body up into the hills and burned it. Pretty elaborate way to get rid of a body. Did you talk to his family? They say the same thing as his editor... sometimes he just drops off the grid. I didn't say much because we're not trying to raise an alarm. This is enough for an investigation, boss. Coroner has the body. If the autopsy says that it's Vincent, then absolutely. If it doesn't, we got nothing. _ Excuse me. That is quite a lot to hear. I am trying to process that. I almost didn't tell you any of this. I almost thought I'd just ghost you. Vincent thought that someone had paid to have Arturo Lopez killed. What did Lopez know? Why-why would someone want him dead? Lopez was a player and a fixer. He did some favors for me that I'd prefer that nobody hear about, but it was nothing to kill over. Now, what he did for other people, I don't know. I did my best not to know. Edward Wilson? Never heard of him. What about Jonathan Lovell? Jonathan... is... complicated. He is a significant figure. He donated a lot of money. - To you? - Among others. Um, we are not on very good terms right now. The last time he was here, I threw him out of the office. Did, uh, Lopez have something on him? I don't know. Look, I'm the mayor. People don't tell me the kind of things that they want to keep hidden from federal prosecutors. That's it? People are dying, my friend is dead, and all you can say is that you don't know anything? From what you've told me, I'm not sure that your friend is dead, but if he is, then I am deeply sorry. - Don't... - And I didn't have anything to do with it. Lovell took pictures of us. What? That beautiful Malibu house Lovell owns that you took us to had a camera in the bedroom. It took photos of us in bed. That's what that creep showed me in the hallway of my building. He did? Yes. You don't owe Lovell anything. But what... what do you know about him? I don't... I can't help you. I'm sorry. I get it. - Blake, our relationship... - It's okay. You're the mayor. I never expected you to put me first. I will find out who took those pictures. I just told you who took the pictures! I am not a part of any conspiracy. You have no idea what you're involved in. But you are not involved with me anymore. Blake. How could I be with you? I don't trust you. I don't know who you are. I'm the same person I always have been. I am so... disappointed in you. You got this, Chief. Hello? I'm glad you picked up. Yeah, I wasn't sure I should. Uh, how are you? I've been better. Uh, but I'm gonna be fine. I just wanted to apologize. Again. It's okay. If anyone from the press asks anything... Don't speak to them. I won't say a word about anything. I wish I could... We can't talk. This is, uh, quite a lesbian scandal. It's beginning to rival my days in Catholic school. Yeah, I can only imagine. I looked cute in that uniform skirt. But hey, on the bright side, I also look pretty hot in that cartoon, am I right? All right, goodbye. Hey, you... you remember the boxing gloves I got you? Yeah. Use 'em today. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. It is 9:35. The hearing is called to order. These proceedings concern alleged conduct violations by Abigail Thomas, Chief of Police of the Los Angeles Police Department. Uh, at Chief Thomas's request, we have agreed to allow her to make an opening statement. Chief Thomas? Yes. Yes, thank you. I'm sorry, could you speak into the microphone? Oh. Yes, sure. Is that better? Um, I very much appreciate the opportunity to, um, speak to you directly. From the start of this... Uh, feels like months. Uh, from the beginning, I have only said two things. One: that I have done nothing wrong. And two: that my private life is my own. I repeat those words now. I have never given confidential information or contacts to anyone. I did not intervene in my daughter's arrest, and my, uh, son-in-law was treated exactly as anyone else would have been had the case gone forward. What I am accused of is... so far outside of who I am and, uh... what I do and how I operate that I can, um... I can barely wrap my mind around it. I have only ever in my life wanted to be one thing. I've wanted to be a cop. This is not something I chose. It's something that I knew about myself from a very early age. And then to be made chief of the LAPD? I-I... I would just never jeopardize that for anything. I have far too much respect and, uh, affection for the remarkable men and women that I lead to, uh... betray their trust. I hope they know that. And, uh, I hope that you know that now, too. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Chief Thomas. Uh, regarding Kiley Mills and the matter of your daughter's arrest, we'll come back to those issues in a moment. Uh, as for the Henry Jones issue, I want to ask, when you first became aware that your son-in-law was on a list of offenders, what did you do? Well, the report came out when I was at home. I, uh, read a bedtime story to my granddaughter, and then I went to sleep. No, uh, ethical issues there, I don't think. The next morning at work, what did you do? My job. With respect to the report, nothing. Nothing ever. Except worry. All right. We'll circle back to this. Thank you. Uh, Madam President, I believe there is a witness to call. Uh, yes. We'll hear from the commanding officer of the Detective Support and Vice Division. Will you state your name for the record? Vice Commander Rascal Santos. Commander Santos, you led an investigation into the Day Glow Spa, a front for prostitution and human trafficking. - Is that correct? - Correct. And when you learned that Chief Thomas's son-in-law was one of the spa's client offenders, did you notify the chief? I did. - No, he didn't. He didn't do that. - Shh. And what was the chief's reaction? She was concerned, as you can imagine. Upset. She asked me to remove his name from the list of people submitted for prosecution. - I-I did no such thing. - Shh. She specifically asked you to remove her son-in-law's name? Yes. Did you do so? No. I... That's entirely not true. Did Chief Thomas discuss this matter with you again? Yesterday. She came into my office and asked me not to testify here. Okay... This is... He's entirely making this up. Chief Thomas, you are out of order. Commander Santos, please finish. She said if I did, it would be bad for all of us. Thank you, Commander. Chief Thomas, would you like to respond? Yes. Yes, I would. Absolutely nothing that he just said is true. Not a single word. I would never and did not request him to remove my son-in-law's name. We spoke just yesterday to confirm that fact. You admit you spoke to Commander Santos to coordinate your testimony? No, not to coordinate. To confirm. Chief Thomas is confident the commission will find no cause for further action. Ken. Uh, c-can you repeat that, please? Got it. Thanks. The coroner's report is out. Um, the fire victim was a... an African-American male in his 60s. It's not Vincent. No. Huh. So where is he? Terry Simmons. Thank you. So? The Ethics Commission has recommended to the Police Commission you be dismissed. Police Commission agreed. Effective when? Immediately. I see. Thank you. Yeah. See you, Bobbie.
