 That's just how she is. What do you think of Miss Mina's quiz? - I can't stand her. - Well, she is from Alabama. Girl, you look sweet enough to put on my cornflakes. Mm! I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Today we're going to look at six main factors that caused the Industrial Revolution... The rail system, steam power, coal extraction, iron smelting... Can I sit here?

I mean, that was a smart play, coming back from the beach, huh? She'll be back in Iowa in 24 hours. Jay? - Jay, you there? - Yeah. Bring 'em in now, why don't you? You know, if they're good, that's a grand easy and see what the run ends up being. I mean, if I break a hundred, you'll see it, I promise. I, ah... I-I didn't get them. What? What did you say? Sorry, Jay, it sounded like you said you didn't get them. Uh, yeah, I did... I did... I didn't get them. I didn't get the shots. The, uh... The, uh... The camera got smashed. You stupid son of a bitch! You clown. You... You get a new camera, you go back there, idiot. You stupid son of a bitch! What have you done? Sal. Sal! Shut up! Shut up. Just shut up. Shut up. I got the pictures. I was kidding. I'm bringing them in. Here I come. I was kidding. Pat! Psst. Sorry for spottin' your floor. - That's all right. - Why'd you light out so quick? I would've walked with you. I didn't want to be late. You're gonna get us both fired. - Sister Sarah's watching. - Oh, poo Sister Sarah. You knockin' off at 7:00? I'll walk you home. Yeah. Don't let my mama see. Your mama is a whole different story. I'll see you at 7:00. My cousin's got a good job for me over at the auto shop on Centinela. Full time. You gonna drop out? Maybe. My cousin's paying me $37 a week. I could get my own place. I could live with you. Be your woman. Crazy. You're too young. Well, I could lie. Shoot. The preacher or the justice gon' want a birth certificate or something. Then I'll change it. You know, I just want to be with you and get married, be your woman. C'mon. You're dreaming. You're all I dream about. What do we got? Hey, are you okay? Has this colored boy been bothering you? No, sir. I'm colored, sir. You're colored? Yes, sir. I'm mixed race. My mother, she's Negro, and I live with her over in East Sparks. Uh-huh. Hey! She's colored. Get out of here. I said get going. Get! All right, let's go. All right, go on home. Don't be out here with these boys, messing around. You got school tomorrow. Go! Well... like Ben Hecht said, kid, and he was a great writer... There ain't a profession out there, not even soldiering, that makes a selfless hero like journalism. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. And Duffy said, "Socially, a journalist fits between a whore and a bartender, but spiritually, he stands beside Galileo. He knows the world is round." Yeah, eppur si muove. - Whores know that, too. - But... But... But the most important rule of journalism is this, kid... Never have a hangover on your own time. So, how you doing, Mister Singletary? You got to give me something, Pete. I can't... Oh, come on, Jay. You know how the Times works. I do what they tell me. Just get me something, otherwise, I'm gonna kill somebody. 'Cause I try, I put your name on the byline, and they shit-can it. They're elephants. Give me something, Peter, or I'm gonna kill myself. - All right. - I'll kill myself. All right, all right, all right. All right, I got something. I got something. Maybe I got something in here. Here. Tomorrow morning at the city morgue early, there's a press conference. Girl got hacked. Might be interesting. The cop said the body was, and I quote, "really something." Janice Brewster. Give me some photos. Write me something real. I'll see what I can do. Maybe a little more eloquent than "really something." Another stupid little murder about nothing that'll change nothing, and... nobody cares. You know what? That's the gig. You above it? No. I'm down in the gutter lookin' up at it. - Great. - Life Savers. - You mind? - You're welcome. I love you. Do you write for the L.A. Times? - Do I what? - You write for the L.A. Times? Ohhh, no. No, no. I'm a... I'm a... I'm a goddamn stringer for the Examiner. I'm a loser. Can you dig it? - You got a problem, hotshot? - Okay. No, no problem. No? 'Cause if you're feeling... If you're feeling froggy, we can do this dance. - You just make a jump. - It's okay. Pick a lily pad. - You want a Life Saver, kiddo? - No, thank you. Want me to drop you off at school? It's okay. Jesus. What's wrong with him? What's wrong with Jay Singletary? Shit, where do I even start? He was a Marine at the Chosin in Korea for one, but his problems are bigger than that, even. You know when he was 18, he was a full-time reporter for the L.A. Times? He was a damn good writer. But he messed up, you know? Some stories you can't tell. What's that mean? Well, it means... And you'll learn this... Some stories don't want to be told. Some stories will eat you alive. Well, look what the cat drug in. Hi, Mama. Where you been? Just at work. Came straight home. Is that right? Hold up. You was with that Lewis Ferguson, wasn't you? Hmm? Well, let me tell you something, baby girl. He ain't no good. You better than him. He a loser. He is no good! Lewis Ferguson's a good man, Mama. I love him, and he loves me. Oh, my goodness, you stupid girl. You stupid! Shit. Stupid girl. "Oh, I love him. Oh, my stars." Need to do better than this little Podunk town. Goddamn Lewis Ferguson? And how am I supposed to do better, Mama? This is where I belong. This is my home. Where you belong. You don't know nothing where you belong. Shit. You belong... shit. - Mama... I saw that white man again. The one I told you about. Yeah, I seen him again today. Why... Why you worrying about him, huh? Worrying about some white man looking at you. You need to be worrying about your life. That's what you need to be worrying about. Not worrying about somebody looking at you. Worry about doing something with your life! I'm trying. Shit. I was supposed to be Lena Horne, goddamn it. But I chose you. I tried to protect you. It is hard raising a mixed-race child, waiting on her skin to darken. It ain't never gonna darken! Ah, what you gonna do, gonna cry about it? Huh? You gon' cry about it, baby? Huh? What you got to cry about? Huh? What you crying about? You know nothing about... Mama, what is this? I don't understand. What are you saying? Nothing. Fauna Hodel? Tamar... Fauna. You better get dressed. Who is Fauna Hodel? What did you just say? What? Who's Fauna Hodel, Mama? You been sneaking in... In my stuff? Huh? You stealing from me? Hmm? You gonna respect me like that? Huh? Huh?! Don't lie to me. How dare you. How dare you come into my stuff after all I done. Okay, how dare you. Now come on. Gimme that back. That ain't yours. Give it to me. - Give it to me! - Goddamn it! Mama, I will go to the police. I will. Yeah, you would, too, huh? - Mama... - Stupid. You stupid. That's what you are. You stupid. Mama, please tell me. Fine, you want to know? You want to know? I'll tell you. I always hated that name. Fauna. It's like a stupid... Stupid fairy... fairy-tale name. What? You... You... you Fauna Hodel, stupid, you are. You're Fauna. I am? Yeah, you was given to me in a goddamn bathroom. White woman in the restroom at a casino. Lonely, talking my damn ear off, so, you know, I tell her about me and the good Reverend Greenwade. Yeah, I tell her we was married. You know, she was a big tipper, so I laid it on thick. Says "Lord didn't bless us with no children." She asked me if I would adopt her daughter's child. I thought she was drunk, crazy. I mean, who would've thought she wasn't? So... I says, uh, "Wonderful, ma'am." She tipped me $50. Her 15-year-old daughter, that's... Go on, open it now. That's the Tamar right there. Another stupid name. Pregnant by a Negro boy. Here I am... Childless, married to a preacher, decent Negro God-fearing woman. So, she asked me if I would take that baby. Shit, I said, "Praise Jesus," and she tipped me another $50. So, I get this... I get this... this telegram about six months on, and I didn't know what it was, what to make of it. So, I threw the damn thing in the trash. Shit. Now here comes this white lady, okay, you know, on the floor, hollering about keeping my word. You know? Making a scene, about to get me fired. And she bring that baby up here to Sisters. Well, then she meets Christopher. Now Christopher's seen the baby. Now Christopher says, "I... you know, we should keep the baby." He thinks it's gon'... Gon' settle me down, make us a damn family. Well, here we are. Here we are, without the good Reverend Greenwade, of course. Asshole. You know I did the best I could. You was always the best-dressed girl in school. You always had the best clothes. I'm gonna be late. But you know this... This is the important thing. Okay, you look at me. Your white family? They rich. Okay, your... your... Your grandfather, he a famous doctor in Los Angeles. You gonna be rich one day, okay? So, you keep that name. You keep that name legal. Fauna Hodel. That's why you don't need no Lewis Ferguson. Now go and get dressed for school. Don't be late. Hey. Oh, shoot. You know what? Um, you know what? The, uh... the pass is in the car, but I'm... I'm with the L.A. Times, - so... - Go get it. - Yeah, go get it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Better hurry up. They ain't gonna wait. Does he know I stand with Galileo? No, he does not. What, you gonna cry now? Little baby. Catherine, please come to Critical Care. Catherine, please come to Critical Care. Where did Nellie move the patient in 6C to? She better not have released him. Dr. Feldspar changed the diagnosis... This the one that came in yesterday. Is that what you're looking for over here? I think it's the one over there in the corner. That isn't it. So, the thing that really amazed me is the house hadn't been occupied in six months. What? And it smelled just like my mama's sweet potato pie. Man, I damn near looked in that lady oven. - I mean, I couldn't believe it. - I would've. How you doing, Janice? Not that great. - Let me tell you something. - Yeah? My feet have never felt better. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever had. Oh... That's a mess. Okay. This is it. Ah! Wow. I hate this place. Yeah. This is what it's come to. You stupid... Golly. What the hell is wrong with m... What the hell? I'm feeling a lot better, Doc. Come here! - Funny guy. - Come on. - Get up! - Get him out of here. Come on. I don't know who you work for, but that's illegal trespassing. Shit, I bet there's tampering. - Come on, that's... - And littering! - Yeah. - Jackass. - Yeah, littering. - Hey, genius. Ahh! Keep Calvin company. Hey, um, are you Calvin? Yeah. Yeah, they wanted me to... To see if you, uh, needed anything. - I'm good, man. - Yeah. - I'm great. - I'll get off your legs now. - Lewis. Lewis! - Yeah. You got any nickels, dimes, anything? Yeah, I think so. Why? Just give it to me. About an hour ago. Please, could you check downstairs? Thank you. Oh, Lewis? Yes, ma'am? Have you seen Pat anywhere? No, ma'am, not in a minute. Well, if you see her, tell her to see me at once, please. Yes, ma'am. What the hell is going on, Pat? Hello? Hello? - Mr. Hodel? - Who is this? Mr. Hodel, um... - It's Pat. - Pat, I'm sorry. I think you've got the wrong number, and it's Doctor. It's Fauna. Mr... Dr. Hodel... Tamar's daughter. Your granddaughter, sir. Fauna. Hello, Fauna. Nice to hear from you. Where are you? - I'm in Sparks, sir. - Of course. Sparks. Of course. And things are well there? Yes, I-I guess. Has Mrs. Greenwade been taking good care of you? Fine, I guess. Good. Good. Have you spoken to Tamar? N-No, I-I didn't. Good, good. That's for the best. Your mother, sadly, is not well. Not at all. I wouldn't talk to her if I were you. It would be very distressing and confusing. But it's lovely to hear your voice, Fauna. I'm so glad you've contacted me. In fact, you should come here and see me. Would you like that? - Yes, sir, I would. - Wonderful. Call me when you arrive. Goodbye now. Pat! Pat. Yes, Sister Sarah, I'm sorry. - I shouldn't have done that. - I am so sorry, child. I'm sorry you have to bear this burden. No, I should've asked. I'm sorry. Pat! Listen to me. - It's your mother. - My mother? - Mama? - I'm so sorry. Your mother's passed. She's been called. - What? - Your mother is dead, child. Jimmy Lee's gone to God. The police called. It's okay. Let us pray. Let's say the Lord's Prayer. Our Father, who art... Pat. Mama? Mama! Mama! Ma... That's why the car don't work. Everything I'm supposed to be doing. Jimmy Lee, look. She's more screwed up than that screwdriver. Look, damn it. Didn't I tell you I'd get her here lickety split? - Shit. - Can't believe you did that. See what you done did? I hope you're happy. You feel that? I wanted you to feel it... When God tears your heart out. That's what I live with. And everything can be snatched away from me at any moment. When you was a baby, you had them blond curls. We was at the supermarket. White woman said she was gonna call the cops. I had to tell them, "I'm just watching her." I was your nanny. I know, Mama. What the hell you think you're doing? - I'm leaving. - Leaving? Like... Like hell you are. - Like hell you ain't. - I am. Oh... Okay, this is about that Lewis boy, right? Huh? I'll call the police. I'll see him in jail! No, I ain't going with Lewis. I'm going to Los Angeles. What? What are you talking about? What for? I called him. You called who? My grandfather. - You hear that? - Yeah, I heard you. I heard you. Well, he's invited me to Los Angeles, and I'm going. Go on, then. I always... I always knew that you'd leave me, so go on and go. You had me thinking you were dead just now. You know how scared I was? I ran here from the hospital. What would I tell Sister Sarah? "Oh, yeah, my mama, she ain't dead. She's just crazy." You know, I am leaving, Mama. I'm going to find my real family. Watch out, man. Old Billis beat Reginald Hicks up so bad, he died at the 84th Street substation. Billis on the rough side. Now you tell me. - White boys surely do bleed. - Yeah. It's pathetic, I know. Why are you in here? - Why? - Yeah. I expect they'll tell me at some point. Why you in here, man? Why am I here? Uh... Trying too hard or... not trying hard enough. It's hard to tell, Calvin. That's a long way. I've never been to Los Angeles. It's only for a week. If you find out who you are and find your rich family, why would you want to come back here? 'Cause it doesn't matter who I am. I want to be with you. Load up! Take care of yourself now, you hear? You know I will. I got to go. Bye. Hey. I'll miss you. I'll miss you. Oh, what the hell? Jay... Come on, come on. Gentle. Easy, easy, easy. This is horse shit. - Oh, yeah, it is. - You want to press charges? Uhh... no. Just want to make sure I can still play the piano. What happened? - Nothing. - Was it Billis? If you want, I can take this to the captain. - No, no. Thank you, but no. - For Christ's sakes, - you're a reporter, Jay. - It's nothing. - It's nothing?! - It's not a big thing. I don't want to make a stink. Then next thing you know, I fly down a flight of stairs and hang myself in a cell. You know how it goes. Well, I talked to him about dropping the charges. He agreed, seeing as we served together and all. Thanks, pal. Ooh. What's that? Oh, 20 exposures that Billis did not find. Listen, Jay... Be careful. Billis, he's just a hand. You don't want to see what he's connected to. What are you talking about? I'm talking about if you're seeing Billis, you're in the wrong place. Story of my life. I'll see you around. 1 to 10, how great do I look? Don't answer that. You ought to come for dinner some time. Two up, one back, right? Take the higher ground. Take the high ground, and don't piss in the stream, boys. We'll be drinking that water tomorrow. We'll be drinking that water tomorrow. Thank you. Beautiful day. Yes, it is. - Smoke? - No, thank you. I don't smoke. That's good. - Are you traveling far? - No, sir. Just to Los Angeles. What brings you to Los Angeles? A Greyhound. I'm visiting my grandfather. Never met him. Well, that will be interesting. Yeah, I just want to know where I come from and who I am. That's a good thing to know. Well, that's my ride. - See ya. - Bye now. Yeah? Yeah, is this, um, Jay Singletary, the... the reporter? Yes, who... who is it? Yeah, y-you the one that wrote that, uh, article for the Los Angeles Examiner about Dr. George Hodel? In '49? You there? Uh, yeah, yeah. George Hodel, yes. Look... you were right about him. You got to keep looking. Y... Hello... What... Who... Hello? Hello? Hello? Dr. George Hodel. - Hello? - Yes, hello. This is Fauna Hodel again. I'm George's granddaughter. Mm-hmm. Listen, I know I already called twice, but is Dr. Hodel there? No, he's not here. I'll take a message. Thank you, yes. The message is from Fauna. - Mm-hmm. - And I'm in Los Angeles. I'm at the downtown Greyhound station. I'll let him know. Thank you, ma'am. Hello, um, is this, uh... Is this Corinna Hodel? - Who's calling? - Mrs. Hodel, this is Fauna. Fauna Hodel. I... I believe I'm your step-granddaughter. Please, ma'am, I-I-I'm sorry to bother you, but, you know, Dr. George Hodel, he invited me to Los Angeles to come visit, and... I can't seem to reach him, so maybe you... You listen to me now. Your grandfather... he's a very, very dangerous man. Stay away. Stay away from him. Far, far away. Your granddaughter called. I'll take care of it.
