 The Hodel thing, it's real. Nice night, huh? Are you friends with Dr. Hodel? He's a genius, right? Best doctor in the city. Maybe the country, right? Mate in four. I'm very disappointed you lost her. The city isn't safe, not for someone like that. Well, now it's mate in two. There's no way out, friend. Dr. Hodel? Ah, yes. 8:00.

 Sepp... find her. Find her. Sit. Well, I-I guess you'll have plenty of time to figure out your next move. No. I'm gonna spoil his game. Yeah? Hello? I know who you are. Do you know who I am? This is... Corinna Hodel. You... You wanna know something? I'll show you something. I'll tell you something. ♪ Teddy bear, teddy bear, turn around! ♪ ♪ Teddy bear, teddy bear, touch the... ♪ You didn't touch the ground! Hey, what's going on, Frank? - Oh, my goodness. - Yeah, how you doing? - How you guys doing? - Hey, man, I'm... I'm glad... Hey, I got it... I got it right here. This is good. Hey, man, maybe you can help me out. - Ah, really? - Yeah, that's all of it. - Yeah. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. N-No, ma'am. I'm in Los Angeles. Could you tell Lewis...? Can you please tell Lewis that I-I miss him? Thank you. Goodbye, ma'am. Good morning. You all right? Good morning. Yes, fine, thanks. Thank you. You sure work hard on that car. Didn't know you liked cars so much. No, I hate cars. I hate that car in particular, but... without that car, it's nearly three hours on the bus to work and school. Can't be done. I had a flat tire. 12 minutes late, and the manager lodged a complaint. Boy, was he happy to have a reason. All I want to think about is propulsion. Some white men take it personal, like me tryin' to succeed is taking something from them. Aren't they all like that? No. Some don't mind. It's Sunday. I got some errands. What do you need to do today? I'm... gonna keep looking, I guess. Can't let it go? What if he's wonderful? Or what if he needs my help? Would you stop before you knew? I guess not. I'll take you to the bus. But, uh, there's one thing we got to do first. So, you're back on the beat, huh? It is what it is. An hour and a half commute. I think about my life. I listen to the Beatles, try to figure out what makes the girls scream like that. Right? Look, Ohls, I'm, uh... I'm sorry. No, no, no, Jay, it is what it is. We're never gonna be square. I'm gonna take a shit. - That's nice. Yeah, it's the nicest toilet we'll see today. Talk to Miller. He's a four-fifteen. Mmm. So, what's, uh... What's a four-fifteen? Penal code, disturbing the peace. He's kiddin'. Why the hell aren't you retired? I've been in 32 years. Oldest living cop in captivity. I could retire, but I'd start drinking and never stop. I done it all, son. Robbery-homicide, juvenile, vice, aah... So, do you remember the Black Dahlia murder? Of course! Sure! Wouldn't be an LA cop if I didn't have my own Dahlia story. Yeah. I knocked on doors. We called it the "werewolf" until the Black Dahlia name hit. You ever hear of a copycat? - Copycat? - Yeah. Nah! Nothing sticks out. - No? - No. She was unique. Ohh, whew, aah, you seen the pictures, right? Uh-huh. I-I remember thinking, "He musta hated her to do what he did to her." You think so? Chop her in half? Her face? Ohh, well, he hated her pretty good, you ask me. Yeah, I don't, uh... It doesn't look like hate. It looks like something else. What are we doing here? Starts in laughter, ends in tears. What is that? We're tipping Nero. This is where they found him. It's actually an ancient Egyptian practice called "libation". Pre-dates Christianity. Were you friends with Nero? We ran a little as kids, had a little clique tied up with Slausons, but Nero didn't have no real friends. But look at this. It's... There's no crime scene. It's nothing. I'm sorry. Yeah. Not as sorry as Nero. There's no one to cry for Nero. So, how was he supposed to be any different? No pops, mom's on the street. She used to keep him locked in for days at a time. I came in on him once, and he had a busted foot, all swole. Been left alone in there for two days. He was eight years old. How was he supposed to end up any different than he was? Hey! What's wrong with you?! Why you throwing shit around my house? I'm sorry, man. I... All right, we're sorry. You see me throwing shit around your house? Hey, man. Hey, buddy. You live here? You see the fuzz come in here? Yeah, Brunos with their buzzers. You see anything else? I seen lots. I seen a man park his big, black, shiny Buick up there and get out, walk around like he own the place. I told the police, too. I seen One-Eye Mexican Carlos... He kick a dog to death. Man, that ain't right. He's a mean son of a bitch. Hey. Hey. Didn't you say something about a white man in a Buick? I don't know what's going on, Terrence. I don't. There's a man... a man who follows me around sometimes. I swear to God I don't know why. And, yeah, he drives a Buick, but I barely knew Nero. Yeah. Yeah, right. It's just Nero. Who cares? Terrence, please. I got nothing to do with this. You got nothing to do with it? You got something to do with it. Well, look what the cat drug in. Hi, Big Momma. I-I'm sorry I... What kinda place do you think I'm running here? Jimmy Lee called so angry, and now she's coming to Los Angeles tonight. Where you at Terrence's place last night? Nothing happened. It wasn't like that. Well, damn, girl, you move fast. You only been here a few days and already moving in on a boy like that? You a fast mover. Tina, I was just scared because of Nero. And... And what? You thought Terrence's big, strong arms was gonna keep you safe? Well, Terrence ain't much my type anyway. He have a little stick up his ass for me, but I can see it. This came for you today. Xander said a white man brung it, but I didn't see him. Thanks, Tina. You're welcome. A happening? Jesus, Jay. Peter. Peter. Just tell... tell Eddy it's never gonna happen. You know what, give Eddy a month, he'll forget all about it. Just, uh... uh, wait, Peter, listen. The... The Bloody Romeo thing... I'm going ass backwards on it 'cause the deeper I dig, the dumber I get. Yeah, you know what, I needed that like 16 hours ago. There's this copycat angle. There's this copycat angle. You know what, go for it, Jay, but I can't assign it. What about the Hodel thing? There's something there. I can taste it. The ex-wife... she's calling me. I can feel it. She's gonna talk. Damn it, Jay, no, God damn it. - I can feel it, Peter. Don't talk to me about this stuff. God damn it, enough. Hey. - Huh? You really think she wants to talk? Ohh, Peter. She's calling me in the middle of the night, she's crying. Look. That came across the Art Desk.

You lost, sweetheart? I'm looking for my grandmother. Corinna Huntington? Grandmother? What's your name, hon? Fauna Hodel. Oh, yeah? Whaddaya know? Hey, Jane! How's kicks? Screw off, Bob. Talk to me when I've had six drinks. I met your grandfather, too. I think Corinna's gonna be in Room Three. I hate that pretentious shit, myself. Did you know Tamar? I've heard of her. Did you know Tamar? What... What have you heard? Six drinks? C'mon, I'm so bored. Blow, Bob. I'm in the middle of something here. My socks fell off. Six drinks... It's gonna take 15 minutes for six drinks. Bob, blow. Beat it. - Come on. I'm bored! How many times do I have to say, "Beat it"? Go find someone else to drink with, Bob. Hon, honey. Wait one second. Mrs. Huntington would like to speak with you. Oh. Fauna. Come in. Have a seat. Ma'am, I-I wanted to apologize for what I said in the car. Yes, yes. I can't remember. I-It's all so... Ma'am, I need more. Can you please tell me my father's name? The ballet dancer? Did you like the piece? My "Happening"? N-No, ma'am. Avant-garde needs courage. Do you know what that word means... Avant-garde? No, ma'am. Think of it as a term for an advanced, profound conscience, based on a deeper understanding of history. It takes hard work and study. We have another word for art that is easy to enjoy... Kitsch. Like a television show. So, was it just me getting my clothes snipped off? Yes, ma'am. There is nothing worse in this world than a literalist thinker. Willful stupidity. I hate talking after these things. Do you even know what that word means? "Literalist". Yes, ma'am. It's like when the President said that, "America has tossed its cap over the wall into space." He wasn't talking about a real wall or a real cap. And for your show, I think you just wanted for us to be responsible for you. Joining in, or even just watching, doing nothing. Either way, you would have been the one getting hurt. Smarter than your mother ever was. Mrs. Hodel... Um, Mrs. Huntington, I need to talk to you about Tamar. I'm sorry. I can't stay here, child. Surely you understand that. Not Tamar. Not Hodel. Apate. But why? Aah! All right, now, quiet, quiet! Hey, Quiet now. Quiet. Oh, I'd like to slice off your calf and fry it up and eat it and puke it up in front of you. You think he has everything? He knows everything? I have something he doesn't know. I've been places he's afraid of. I'll show him a curse. I'm ready for the next step. That's what this is... My own little show, the real happening. Shit! Start screaming. You should. I'll gut... Gut you before they get down the stairs. Whoo! Whoo! Ohh! Ahhh! Reporter. Are you all right? I'm fine. Should we...? Yeah. What do we... - Whoop! Sorry! - Ohh! Oh, didn't realize anybody was down here. Hi, Fauna. Oh, what's... Is that guy okay? What's wrong with that guy? - Yeah, he's fine. He just had a little bit too much to drink is all. - A lot of things to drink. - Let's go find another room. - He got tired. - Come on, sweet pea. - All right. - Come on. They... They saw me. Come on. Let's go. They saw me. They saw me, too. She said my name! We got to... We got to clean this place up. Come on. Help me. We'll roll him up in this. Let's just go. Please. We can't! They saw me and she said my name, and she saw you, too. You... Can you help me? All right, let me think. Maybe we should drive. Ahh. I don't think that's how you make a gin and tonic. Do I look like a bartender? I know where we can take him. Great. All right, let's get this over with. You... Come on. Let's go. No, wait, wait, wait. Huh? We got to find out who he is. He knows my grandfather. Shit. You left your fingerprints all over the thing. Oh, shit! Yeah. Find his wallet. Got it. Wake up, buttercup. I'm gonna go take a piss. My partner's gonna ask you some questions. We've got a lot to talk about. Ohh! Time to get up. Where's the dog? What dog? The dog that shit in my mouth. I'm gonna make you some coffee. Yes. Excuse me. You saved my life. Thank you. Uh-huh. There's an address. Do you know who he is? Who? Ivanovich Victor Sepp. I know him now. Well, I-I don't know him, but I've been seeing him. He's been following me around a long time... years. Years? Yeah. You looking for Tamar, too? Yeah. You know where she is? Maybe. Maybe. I'll make you a deal. Find out why that guy was... And then you and I will go together and talk to Tamar. Yeah. Okay, sure. I can do that. I can, uh, check his place out, see what I can see. I'll go today. Why do you want to know? Why are you looking for Tamar so bad? Tamar's not the, uh... Not the story. It's George Hodel. She... She knows something or knew something. What thing? Uh, George Hodel was involved in criminal activity, and one of the thing... One of the many things he was doing was running an abortion clinic out of Hollywood, which is illegal. Abortion? That's what this is about? Well, it's about other things, too, but nothing I'm sure of. Look, I'm not gonna help you write a story that hurts my mother and my family. So, leave her out. And me. No, don't write about me. Don't ask about me, okay? Yeah, I got it. I just want the truth. That's all. I think maybe Tamar is in Hawaii. You get me a plane ticket to Hawaii, and we'll go talk to her together. I'll get you the complete address when we get there. Just promise me you'll take me with you. Hawaii, huh? Shake my hand? Yeah? Mr. Sepp? Message for you. ♪ Midnight ♪ ♪ You've got to get there ♪ ♪ At midnight ♪ ♪ And you'll be met there by others ♪ ♪ Like you ♪ ♪ Brothers, eyes blue ♪ ♪ Smiling on the street ♪ ♪ I'll dream ♪ Yeah! Let's hear it for the band! Come on. Give a hand for the band! It feels good to be back in Los Angeles. Be right back. You sounded real good up there, Momma. Like Lena Horne. Well, you know, singing's the one thing that always came easy for me. Don't matter what the song's about, I can sing it. You know, Sammy Davis heard me sing right there? Right there. Right here, back in the day. He came up to me, gave me his card. He said he was gonna take me to Capitol Records. Sammy Davis. So, where you been, huh? Shacked up? Momma, that man who used to follow me around in Sparks... Momma, I need to know some things about that man and about George Hodel. He said your name, Momma. I don't know nothing about it. - I really need to know... - You need to know some things? Yes, I do. You need to know how good you got it. Shoot. Compared to Mississippi? That's not what I'm talking about, Momma. Did you know Dr. Hodel? Did you? He called you Mrs. Greenwade. Come on. I see you dead before I let them at you. I can't protect nothing. I can't control nothing. But I can do that. Violence... It'll burn your heart, mark you forever if you don't let it go. Now you know something. You can't hide the truth forever, Momma. You need to come home with me, baby, 'fore you break my heart. I'm gonna find out everything, and I don't care what it breaks. - Hello, Mrs. Ellington. - Good to see you. Nice to see you. - Hello. - I'm so glad you could make it. Oh, yes. Particularly. Yeah. Thank you. Ms. Huntington? Hi. You called me. You remember? I'm a... I'm a reporter. Jay Singletary. I'd like to talk about, uh... About George Hodel. I have no idea who you are. If you could just take a moment and take a look at this picture, if that means anything to you. Excuse me. This man is bothering me. Yes, ma'am.
