 She destroyed our family. That trial was 10 lifetimes ago. She accused him of that murder. She took it back, Jay. It is the truth. I need to talk to you about my real mother. I used to call her "Apate"... The goddess of deceit. You saved my life. I just want the truth. Tamar is in Hawaii.

 You get me a plane ticket, and we can talk to her together. Well, I did take note that, uh, she exhibited delusions of grandeur and was given to the telling of fantastic tales, which had little or no basis in fact. We call this, uh, delirium's dementia, which is common in hysterics. Much of her, um, abnormal behavior has to do with, uh, her mania for sex. Um, even, um, at 14. Even as young as 11 years old, as her father and others have testified. And in your professional opinion, why would that happen?

 The Electra Complex is a young girl's psycho-sexual competition with her mother, or in this case, stepmother, to become the dominant female. In Tamar's fantasy life, she supplants the mother. We've seen how Tamar is obsessed with her father. And he is an impressive man, after all. But in her poor, deluded mind, the things that she dreamed and desired became real. Tamar even claimed that Dr. Hodel was the Black Dahlia Killer. Well, perhaps he's the Lindbergh baby, too. Synced & corrected by MaxPayne == https://subscene.com == What? What? Here I come bearing gifts, my liege. Oh, no. This makes me... That makes me very nervous. I apologized to King Eddy. I'm back in the fold. What are you... What... Do I even ask? You wanted to have Life Savers. Oh, God, what... You're my favorite life saver. 500 of the best words you've ever read on the framing of an innocent man. - Okay, what... what is this? - With my notes. Fact-check away. Why do I feel like there's some big, terrible "and"...looming here? I found her. Who? You f... You found who, Jay? Tamar Hodel. The daughter. I found her again, baby. That is not all. What? Hey, Shell-Shocked. Okay. All right. Here, why would I even care? That's not big enough, Jay. Peter, things are shaping up. Things are shaping up. It's like... It's coalescing. It's... It's... It's... It's feeling a lot more like proof, like a smoking gun. Oh, a lot like proof, he says. Imagine... Imagine every crazy thing she said was true. Just stop and think about it. Stop and think about it. She said that her dad was the Black Dahlia Killer. Mm. Mm. No one believed her. They laughed at her. But the cops always like the guy that had a medical background. No, Jay, listen to me. It would have to be the A-bomb, okay? Not "like," not "something like." You want the A-bomb? I'll give you the A-bomb. I found Tamar Hodel's daughter. Fauna Hodel. Her name's Fauna Hodel. I found her. And the dates... The dates, Peter. Wait. What? Th-They work out. They work out. Daughter? Tamar had a daughter. That's why they sent her away... The convent. They sent her away. She gave up the baby. She ran off to Hawaii. Daughter? Tamar's daughter? Oh, shit! Yes, yes! Are you telling me... Excuse me. That's exa... What?! What?! What do you want?! Okay. Okay. What do you want?! I can't give you what you want. I cannot fight you. All right, he didn't do anything. I can't fight you. It's enough. It's enough. It's enough. I want to. We did this already. Talk to me. Finish the thought. Sit down and finish the thought. Are you messing with me here? Huh? I'm not messing with you at all. Are you shooting me straight? I'm shooting you straight. The daughter... the granddaughter... the daughter. Yes, yes, that's exactly what I'm talking about. Because that is good. Exactly. It is good. That could be something. Yeah! Just leave the bogeyman shit out. Deal. Now I need... I need two tickets to Hawaii, because that's where she's at. No, no. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. This is real, Peter. Two tickets to Hawaii. I'm gonna take her daughter to Hawaii to get her talking. I'm gonna... If I give her her long, lost daughter, I've got the story. What is this, a game show? What's behind door number two, Jay? Look at me. Look at me in the eye and tell me you got the A-bomb. I got the A-bomb. That's what I'm telling you. I got the nuke, and it is primed and ready. You send me. You're a tremendous liar, and I'm gonna do it. So take enough rope to hang yourself. No per diem. No room and board. And I'm gonna have to tell somebody, so you have to show up with something. You've got to come up with something, okay? You're not gonna regret this, Peter. I regret it right now. Remember where you are. Remember Emperor Trajan? Love the guy. Miss him every day. Emperor Trajan was betrayed by his own men, okay? Buried up to his neck in sand. His counselor Vespasian said to him, "Memento quo nunc es." "Remember where you are." Can I go? Yeah, go. Go. You want a lei? I'm gonna send you a lei. Go. Fauna. Come on, now. We have just enough time to eat before the bus. Yeah, Mama. You all set to come home now, right? No more of that attitude. Yes, Mama. Okay. Somebody's at the door for you, Fauna. A white man. Knows who you are and everything. Who the hell are you? M-Mama, I know him. He's a friend. Oh, goodness. A friend? Fauna, I've got the tickets. Show me. What the hell is this? Those are mine. Tickets. - To Hawaii? - Mm-hmm. I don't know who the hell you think you are, but you're not taking that child nowhere. So take the damn tickets to Hawaii... Mama! ...and get the hell out this house! You better... Mama, I can't believe you just did that! You come around here again, I will call the law and have your ass arrested. She is 16 years old. Ma'am, t-this... This is absolutely not... not what it looks like. What's it look like, asshole? It looks bad. Yeah? But just... I'm... You think this is my first trip to L.A.? Huh? You think I'm as dumb as she is?! No. Mama. Shut up, Fauna! You know what, Mama? I'm looking for Tamar. I'm looking for my real mother. Ohh... How many times I've got to tell you that you have got to be careful? You know what, Mama? When are you gonna tell me the truth? I ain't dumb, like you keep saying! What do you know? You looking real dumb right now! Can you get more of those? Can you get more of those?! You don't know who that man is! You don't know who that man is! What the hell is wrong with you?! Can you get more? Yeah. I have the receipts. It's just paper. What time's the flight? It leaves in two hours. We have to go. Two hours? Mama, put the knife down, Mama. Mama, put that knife down! Shut up! Plane leaves in two hours! Get on out of here! And you! I will braid a switch and whip your fast ass! You... Ohh! I'm with you on this one, Jimmy. That girl gonna get herself into a whole lot of trouble. Shit. She's gone. Fauna! Fauna! Fauna! Fauna! Goddamn it. Lokelanai Road. Yeah. I think we're close. It really is something. I can see why... why my mother wanted to be here. Yeah, it's great, but we should, uh... We should get moving. Heaven must look like this. I didn't know you could see so far, so much. I didn't know the ocean was so big. What am I gonna say when I see her? It doesn't matter. She'll be happy to see you. Come on. Shoot. I've got so many questions. This is it? 12 Lokelanai Road? This is it. I don't know any Tamar, but look back there. Are you sure? Yeah, go ahead. I hold mail for all kinds of people around here. Sometimes letters sit there for a few months, sometimes forever. So how do you know who is who? Don't take what isn't yours, friend. Yep. Damn it. The most expensive sunglasses in Hawaii. Here. Cheer up. We'll find her. It's an island, right? She can't be too far away. She doesn't want to see me. Yes, she does. No, she doesn't. Come on. Fauna... Well, it's true. You know, she gave me away for a reason. Because she was... she was too young. That's the reason. Well, why is she hiding? She's not hiding from you, I can tell you that much. What do you mean? All I mean is, she could be hiding from anybody, from a bad boyfriend, from a relative. She doesn't want to answer questions from a reporter about what her father did. We're gonna find your mother. Don't worry. What did my grandfather do? He ran an illegal abortion clinic, like I told. You know what? Here. Trade. What do you think about this? What's that drink you ordered? An Arnold... Palmer? Great golfer. It's a hell of a drink. It's half, uh, iced-tea, half-lemonade. I think you'll like it. Kind of bitter, kind of sweet. Ha. Like you? Exactly like me. Grab him. Ohh! Hawaii. I haven't been here in... I came back... Well, I came here on my way back, uh, from not here, but... Hawaii, generally speaking. Back from where? From Korea. You a soldier? Mm. I remember walking through Honolulu thinking, "They should've trained us how to come back," you know? They teach us how to fight, then bury us in the shit, and they never show you how to come back. There she is. Two Arnold Palmers. Burger coming. Young lady, I got a question for you. Do you know a Tamar? Tamar Hodel? Naaw. Mnh-mnh. Where do, uh, the people live that get their mail from Tico? Well, Tico takes mail to all kind of people on boats, but there's a bunch living by the beach on Waikitea, just south. Waikitea? Mm-hmm. Living here must be wonderful. Aloha. What are these people? I'm just excited, I guess. I can't shake the feeling that she's gonna look in my eyes, and it's all gonna make sense. Yeah, I get that. Aloha. Aloha. I'm gonna go to the bathroom. You all right? Yeah. Hey, you, come on. Come on. Yeah? I'm the f... Don't do it. Go for it. That's it. You see that? She was looking at him. Go, go. That rascal left you all alone? What are you doing by yourself? You're the prettiest girl in the joint. Come on, dance with me. No, my... my friend is gonna be back. Come on, dance with me. No, I... I think I should stay. Come on. Come on, dance with me. I'm sorry. Come on. You're... You're a dancer. No. I'm a dancer. Listen, I-I d... Let's just dance. I don't think this is a good idea. My friend is gonna be back soon. No big deal, it's just one dance. Come on, don't be cruel. Don't be cruel. I really don't... Come on! Just one dance. That's all. You and me, yeah. Ooh. I think she's all right. Just got off six months in the Big Blue. It's all right, pal. I get it. Don't worry about it. Y'all guys better not start nothing in here. We're not gonna start anything. We're not gonna start anything. Jay, Jay, I think we got to go now. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? What are you doing? Jay. All right. Jay... will you listen to me? I'm just making sure we don't get in a fight. You're doing something. Huh? Jackass! You gonna take that? Yo, shitbird. If we're not dancing, we're fighting. All right. Hey! Hey! Put that down! Put it down. Put it down before I stick it up your ass. All right. You were looking to fight all those guys. No, not all of them. You were looking to get your ass kicked. Hello? Um... Um... Yeah, I'll sleep in the car. What? Yeah. I like sleeping in cars. Any service in this joint? Wake up. Hmm? What? What? What? Are you okay? Are you okay? Yeah. You were screaming. I was? Uh... You... you heard me... You heard me scream? What were you dreaming about? I don't remember. It wasn't your fault. What wasn't? That man... Sepp. You did what you had to do. Yeah, maybe. He would've killed us. God will forgive you. God, huh? Yeah. They never talked about how good it would feel. They would never tell you that. It's like... riding in the chariot of the sun god. One thing I never expect... ...to enjoy it. You know the one thing I learned in Korea? Good never wins. Right and wrong? I could barely make out dead from alive. Talked to a dead guy for 10 minutes. He was... He was... Uh, he was frozen. How are you supposed to make out right from wrong in a place like that? And you pay a price. They own you. You take a life... and they come with you. They come with you forever... ...like little... ...Splinters in the heart. I'm only breathing right now because of what you did. I don't care how it made you feel. Hey, do you have a sewing kit? Yes, sir. I just, uh... Do you mind doing me a favor? My stitches are itching the crap out of me. Can you take them out? Just hold still, all right? Hold still, or it'll hurt. Agh! There. All right, fine. Thanks. Five minutes. We could keep driving, but I'm not sure we'd make it out alive. Well, there's nothing here. Let go! Fauna! Give it to me! Come on! Fauna, let it go! Come on! Come on! Let go! Hey... Is your name Fauna? Hey, wait. Wait! It's gonna be all right. You don't know that. When you were born, they never let me hold you. The nurse let me see you. I'll never forget that face. You're still so beautiful. They told me that I'd never see you, so it would be best if I never even held you. Can I hold you now? Can I call you "mother"? Oh, no, all of my children call me Tamar. Tamar, uh... what happened? Oh, Fauna. What happened? Who is my father? Was he Negro? No. I'm sorry. You aren't. I wish you were. ...they despised all of us unwed mothers. There was no God in that place. I put Negro on your birth certificate as your father because I just wanted you to belong. I admire black people so much. Every white person I know was a liar. And black people were nice to me. In the news, they fought for justice, for equality, they know right and wrong. The name Fauna comes from a Robinson Jeffers poem that I just adored. I even used it again because I thought I'd never see you. So who's my father, then? Oh. I pushed his memory away because our understanding levels were so different. Please, Tamar, what is all this lying about? Don't do this, Fauna. You're ruining our perfect moment. Don't you see? It's selfish. Don't do that! Well, why did Corinna tell me you were dead? She hates me because of what I said at the trial. Trial? What trial? Oh. She didn't tell you? Tell me what? Right before you were born, there was a trial. It was terrible. What kind of trial? Oh, it was a "morals" trial with my father, George Hodel. Improper acts, improper relations. What does that mean? It means that we spent every day together, until they left me in juvenile detention for three weeks. And worse, they had a psychologist testify that I was crazy. Wh... what? He made love to me. Ow! What? Take me home. What is it? You know, screw you, Jay! Just get me out of here. How could you do that? How could you bring me here without telling me what's really going on? How could you? Listen, I-I... You're a liar, just like everybody else. I have to talk to her. We can go home tomorrow. Is it true? Is he my father? Sometimes you catch a bad one, Fauna. My whole life has been a bad one! All my life, I just wanted to be something, and... I'm just made of garbage and shit. It's all shit. Well, great. Most people, normal people... ...they don't know it. They've never seen it. They feel it, just once at the end. You found out the truth, Fauna. Death and evil, they're around us all the time. And the line between us is, um... it's thin as tissue paper. You got the bad news... and you got to know it for the rest of your life. I hate you. Listen, I wanna, uh, I wanna leave Fauna out of it. We got to have her. She's the key. She's the glue. I get it, Peter. That's the angle that makes it work, Jay. I want to leave her out of it. It'll ruin her. Jay, listen, I talked you up, showed your Brody Stiles piece around. If you can land this Hodel thing, they're gonna move me up, maybe, and, look, I want you as my foreign correspondent. I'll send you to Vietnam. We want you in the mix. I think you've got the goods, Jay, I always have. But this story has to work. Yeah. We need the girl. Right. Hi. Mind if I join you? What if I said yes? I'd keep asking, like a drip. You'd better sit down, then. Sorry, guys... Come on. Let's go. Right on. You like it here? Boring. Beautiful but boring. The men think they're daring. Talking about free love, walking around naked, thinking that they're pushing the boundaries. You know something about men pushing boundaries, don't you? Do I? Do you? I know something about that. Do you? I was there in '49, Tamar. I covered your trial. Oh, yeah? I believed you about everything. I need your help. What you started, you can finish. What happened to you does not have to happen again. We can stop him. Wh... who? You know who. You can't. You haven't learned yet? He's a big-wig for the city. It's not just the police, it's not just the movie people. The gangsters use him, they use his clinics. They keep him safe, too. The universe... protects George. He killed the Black Dahlia, didn't he? Elizabeth Short? You knew it. Nobody believed you, but you knew it. Everyone knew. We all knew it. Wait. "Everybody knew." Goddamn it. George makes these. He sends them to me, and I've saved them. But you can look at these. No one knows. No one. The police thought that they owned George. But if you own somebody... sometimes it turns out that they own you. You'll find out. He already owns you. Elizabeth Short... Janice Brewster... It was you, George. It was you. Hello? Peter, uh, I'm back. I just got back into town. Ah. Okay. Um... let's meet. Not here. I, uh... Ch... Chinatown, at Ludong's. And bring the girl. She doesn't want to do it. Just bring her, Jay. What is this? What the hell is going on? That's a good question. I thought you were taking me home. Yeah, we got to make one stop first. Wait here. I'll be back in 10 minutes. Wait for what? Just wait. There's another thing you got to know. I'm sorry. I think George Hodel is a murderer. And I think he killed the Black Dahlia. I'm sorry. Sometimes you catch a bad one, huh? 10 minutes. I got it, Peter. I got it all. Jay-bird. What the hell happened with the rental car, amigo? Jesus, our guy was screaming. I got notes, I got pictures. I couldn't get her to go on record, but... Where's the girl? ...I think I've got enough. Jay, where's the girl? I... Did... Did you hear what I just said? I can prove that Hodel killed the Dahlia. And more. He killed more women, Pete. Wait a minute. George Hodel? He was making art, just like his artist friends. It's all here, if you know where to look for it. He killed Janice Brewster, too. Wait a minute, Janice Brewster? What are you... what the hell are you talking about? Look at this, look at this. I got to develop the Hawaii pictures... Jay, hold up. No. ...obviously from Hawaii, but... but this one... No, hold up. Yeah? Hold up, we're off. I don't want to look at that. Just hear me out. I don't want to see that during my dinner. It'll just make me sick. Hear me out, Peter. No, no, you were supposed to bring the girl. Where's the girl? You said you had the daughter. A blood test was something that maybe might hold up. I want to leave her out of it. We can't, they can't. They? Wh-What are you... What are you talking about? Who? Wh... who can't? What's going on, you got... You got a rat in your soup? What? You know I was a baby reporter with the 45th when they liberated Dachau? Jay, it was so bad, the smell, evil of it. Evil is a live dog, brother. I always thought... I always thought I'd recognize it, you know, and fight. Of course I'd fight. I'm a good guy. But when it comes, sometimes... Sometimes when it comes, it's slippery. Real evil is tricky, Jay. What are we talking about, Peter? Huh? Just remember where you are. Hey, cupcake. Long time no see, buddy. How you doin'? Go on, make a run for it. You can make it. I'm sorry. Okay, come on. Get up. Hands where I can see 'em. Let's go. I'm sorry, Jay. Yeah, well, we're all pretty damn sorry. Hello? Hello? This Jimmy. Hi, Mama. I'm, uh... I-I'm sorry I had to go see her. I-I just had to. Well, then, I guess you got it all sorted out, huh? It was horrible, mama. It was just horrible. I love you, Mama. And, um... And I just... I wanted to say thank you for taking care of me all these years. I love you so much. And I-I won't leave you again. You can call me Pat if you want. Well... ...what you need to do is get yourself home, Patta. My Patta. Don't matter who your birth mother is. You're always gonna be Jimmy Lee's little girl. And always will be. You're all I got, you're all I ever... Mama, did you know about the trial? I don't know why you keep askin' me about that, you stupid girl? Why you keep askin' me that? Go on and stay there, then. Stay in Hawaii. Good riddance to bad rubbish! No Mama, I-I'm... I ain't in Hawaii anymore. I'm in Los Angeles. You ain't never got to come back here, as far as I'm concerned. No, no... Hey, Pretty Jimmy. What's got you so blue? Fauna's in Hawaii? It seems. I'll get you a drink. I brought wine. Well, bring it on in. I was just making myself a steak. You like yours... ...rare? Please. Terrible, Jimmy. You're only as good as your tools. Ah. Well, at least... I'm sorry I missed Fauna in Los Angeles, but it never seemed to be quite the right time. Oh, these knives are piss-poor, Jimmy. There's only so much I can do. I'm worried about you, Jimmy. Alone out here, Fauna running wild. And now she's hooked up with some cretin reporter, and my friend, my protégé is dead. It's confusing. You've always been good at keeping secrets, Pretty Jimmy. Hey, Jimmy Lee! Where you at, girl?! Help me! Help me! Hardly sporting, Jimmy. Stanley! Stanley! Oh, God! What the hell, man? Jimmy Lee, hold up.
