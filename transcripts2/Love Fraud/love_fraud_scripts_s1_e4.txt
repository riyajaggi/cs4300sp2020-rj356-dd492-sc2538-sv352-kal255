 [birds chirping] ominous music [Michele] It happened 12 years ago. My husband and I were having difficulties. So it was a really vulnerable time for me. And then I met Scott. But he said, "Oh, you should get out of that and make yourself happy and your kid should be happy," and all that stuff. Our wedding night, he just changed. He kept feeding me shots.

 Shots after shots after shots. He said to my friend, "Michele really needs to go outside. She's had a lot to drink." So he goes out the door. As soon as I get out there, he slams the glass door at me, and I fell backwards and I hit my head on the fire extinguisher and I blacked out. When I woke up, I had blood all over my white dress. It was all red, full of blood. And I ended up with five staples in my head on my wedding night. Yeah. [laughs softly] Yeah.

 And then, after that, it just got worse and worse. He told me, if I ever left him, that he would hurt my kids. Yep. In the morning, when he would leave the house... ...8:25, he'd pull out of the garage. 8:30, he was on the phone, wanting to know what I was doing. And if I didn't answer the phone... ...can't tell you how many times he would just sneak in the house, and all of a sudden, he'd be in the bathroom just looking at me in the shower. It was really scary. And just, this look on his face, you know... It's just, it was really scary. He didn't want me to talk to my mom, he didn't want me to talk to my kids. He would get the t... He would find out how long I was on the phone. "You talked to her for 12 minutes. What did you say?" I said, "12 minutes? How do you even know that?" Mm, he was checking the phone records. And he had a tracker on my phone. I didn't know that. And that's when I started to get stronger and stronger, and not answering the phone, not answering the text messages. And he would get mad and I would just say, "Go ahead, hit me. You're such a man. Go ahead." And then he would just kind of back up and look at me like, "What?" "Yeah, go ahead, try it." And I said, "That's the last time you'll ever do it. I'll take that knife and I will stick you." [chuckles] And I called my mom, she flew out. On the 11th, May 11th, I packed up everything I could pack up, filled the car... The dog, my son... And I left, Mother's Day. In the end, he didn't even take any money from me. Nothing. He just wanted to control me. "Part Time Love" by Bridget Everett Oh You tell me the truth And then you tell me lies First you say hello And then you say goodbye Oh I never know I never know just what you're thinking of But I don't want no No, I don't want no Part-time love [thunder crashes] No... Time's up, honey disorienting music [indistinct chatter] Falling in and out of love [man] Thank you. With you... [man] There you go. Sinister music [Jean] I am afraid that this gal's at risk. We need to stop him. It's as close as we've been in a very long time. [Jean] I want to go down there. - [Carla] When? - Tomorrow. I want to know that he's not hurting other women. He's got a warrant out for his arrest. I think we can get it done. [Carla] Guess who's going for her backup. You. Energetic music [mouse clicks] [Steven] So this is when we first laid eyes on him... ...pumping gas. I-I believe he was getting ready to go to work. [Carla] He just thinks he's footloose and fancy-free down here, don't he? Little does he know. I mean, at this point in time he was, you know, just a normal guy - going to a normal job. - Yeah, but how can you do that, knowing you're a fugitive? Man, I'd be stuck away somewhere [laughing] where no one would ever find me. [Steven] I think he-he feels like he's, - he's too good to get caught. - [Jean] Yep, he does. [Steven] This is Rick at the Honda dealership. So this is the first car dealership that we actually saw him at. And, uh, here's another one. And another. He stayed on the phone almost the entire time that he walked the lot, and he was there for a long period of time. He's got very distinct mannerisms. A lot of times when he's on the phone, he's got his arms crossed like that. You'll see that in-in several videos. He's always in that position when he's on the phone. Always. [Carla] He's gonna get brain cancer or some shit. [Steven chuckles] [Steven] So here he is at the boat. Oscar's vehicle's at the boat, Rick's vehicle's at the boat. And then, at some point... he starts cleaning. [Carla] God, he is a lame-ass worker. [Steven] So, this is Stephanie. She lives in Knoxville. When we first, you know, realized that they were in a relationship, when they were out at bars and restaurants, I mean, it-it seemed like, that she wanted to have a good time with him, and-and, you know, she would smile and laugh at the jokes, and, um, you know, it was, it was almost like a-a real relationship that we were watching unfold. And then one of the other investigators on the team, uh, followed him toward work, but noticed he got off at an exit that he'd never been on before... ...and came to this place. Eerie music This is Stephanie 2. She's new. [Carla] Jesus, what the fuck? [Steven] He's been with her for two or three days. And we noticed that, in order to juggle two women, he would quit going to work so much. And then that brings us to today. This is Lisa. She came into the picture yesterday. [Carla] Jesus Christ. How does he do this? [Steven] And they spent their day looking at houses together. [Carla] Seriously? What the fuck? [phone vibrating] [phone chimes] Oh, hang on. Oh, he's at another hotel right now. [Carla] What? What? He's at the Super 8, just up the road from the wing place. - [Carla] That's our... - [Jean] By himself? - [Carla] That's our place. - [Steven] Uh... that was my question. Who's he there with? So we need to have a plan to get him apprehended tomorrow. We'll have to call the dispatcher and say, "Hey, here's-here's what we got. Put us in touch with somebody." [Jean] Okay. [Carla] Let's do it. Slow, suspenseful music [Carla] So he's in this room right here? [Jason] Um, s-so you see the door that's open right here? - Yeah. - He's down a couple doors. - Oh, he's down there. Okay. - Yeah. [line ringing] [operator] Knoxville Police Communications... [speaks indistinctly] Hi, um, I would like to report a fugitive. Okay. And what's going on? Well... [clears throat] he has been evading... um, he's on probation and he left, uh, Kansas City and he's in Tennessee now. He's at a Super 8 motel and he's got a warrant. He's got two warrants, one with Iowa and one with Kansas. [Carla sighs] And is he white, black or Hispanic? Oh, my God. These cops are so slow. Yeah. His name is Richard Scott Smith. He goes by several other names as well. He's been going by Scott here in Tennessee, but he also goes by... Richard Scott what? Smith. All right, we've got it. [Jean] Okay, thank you. [Jason] Holy shit. He just popped his head out that door. [Steven] You on? [Jason] Yeah, I'm on. [Carla] So you're gonna block him in and pray for the cops? [line ringing] [operator 2] Knoxville Police Communications... [speaks indistinctly] [Jean] Hi, this is Jean Hansen. I called shortly ago and reported a fugitive, and he's getting ready to leave, and I haven't seen anybody show up. Okay. I'm-I'm having a hard time hearing you. Okay. Reported... what was it? I reported a fugitive. - Okay. - Who has two warrants, and he's about to leave the location. Okay. And can you give me an address? The address that you gave? Yeah, it's, uh, w... it's the Super 8 on Snyder Road. - [engine starts] - It's, um, 11748 Snyder Road. Okay. Did you talk to, did you talk to, um, somebody in the police? We're gonna follow him. I'll-I'll call you back. We're gonna follow him and see where he lands. I don't want you to follow him, but I want you to stay on the line so that you can give the information. [Carla] Oh, he's jumping right the fuck out there, too. Fuck me. Yeah, I got him. [indistinct radio chatter] [Jason] Negative. Uh, he's-he's just about to pull into... [speaks indistinctly] Just stand by for a second. [speaks indistinctly] All right, we're going towards the interstate. Looks like we're gonna take Interstate I-40 headed east. - Yeah, we're headed east. - [Carla] Where's he going? [indistinct radio chatter] [Jason] All right, be prepared for a possible exit. All right, he's gonna exit at West Hills. Where the hell is he going? [Jason] Who is he calling now? [Steven] West Town Mall, West Town Mall. [indistinct radio chatter] [Jean] Going shopping? At Sears? - [Jason] What's that? - [sirens wailing] It's for him. [Steven] This is them. It's gonna go down. He's at Dillard's. He's at Dillard's. They're right behind him. Disorienting music This is it. He's toast. [Jason] He's trying to get away from that cop. [Jean] Holy shit. Unbelievable. Whoa! Guns drawn. They've got him in custody. Yes! Fuck yeah. [gasps] [Jean] Oh, my God. Thank God we got him. [exhales] Oh, thank God. [line ringing] [whispers] Please pick up, please pick up. Hi, Stephanie. You don't know me, but this is Jean Hansen. I'm one of Ri... Uh, Scott as you know him... Scott Smith's ex-wives. You know Scott Smith? Well, we just had him arrested. He's been a fugitive, originally for domestic violence. And I'm sorry to say this, but while he was dating you, he's been dating two other people. He's been under surveillance. [Stephanie cries] Are you okay? I'm s... Knoxville. Eerie music Sinister music [birds chirping] - [ship horn blows] - [engine revs] [thunder crashes] [tires screech] atmospheric music [birds chirping] pulsing music I don't know. Aw, man. [indistinct chatter in background] Mm-hmm. [Rachel] I saw Scott here at your boat. Oh. No. I don't know. And, uh... You'd still sell it to him? Well, yeah. Well, I filmed him coming here, sir. - You what? - I filmed him coming here. - Yeah. - By himself. Really? He didn't know we were filming him. What do you think he was doing here on his own? Mm-hmm. [laughs] ambient music [Lee] He's a goddamn motherfucking piece of shit. And I could not believe he did that to my father's yacht. He tried to sink that so he could buy it and repo it, because he works at a place that does that. I mean, it's disgraceful. I'm so embarrassed. I feel so bad for my father because I let him come back here. It is my fault... ...and it makes me feel like I'm naive. But I understand now he's a sociopath. I mean, I don't even know. I don't know if there's anything that I believe now... about him. [geese honking] ominous music [gavel bangs] [judge] All right, record should reflect we are here in State v. Richard Scott Smith, SRCR288645. Uh, the matter before the court today is a, uh, probation violation. - The State ready to proceed? - [prosecutor] Yes, Your Honor. [judge] You have witnesses you'd like to call, or you gonna make argument? - We have witnesses. - Okay. [Sandi] Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Smith has been a relentless serial sociopath and a professional con artist. His actions are all calculated and premeditated. I have with me in the courtroom today others with whom he has committed fraud against since the probation sentencing over two years ago. I found out from a police officer, right after he assaulted me, that Mr. Smith had married a different woman in Las Vegas three days prior to him attacking me, and he was still legally married to two other women at the time. So you can add bigamist to the list. You were controlling, manipulative, verbally and physically abusive towards me. I live with what he did to me every day of my life, and my mind still drifts back to that night he had his hands covering my airway in which I thought that was it. You have not only affected my life but dozens and dozens of others of whom I had the chance to speak with personally. You are a monstrous human being. And I believe that the devil disguises himself in so many ways on this earth, of which you seemingly fit the bill. You are not sorry for what you did to me back then, and you're definitely not sorry for the poor choices you have made. The only thing you are sorry about is the fact that you have finally been caught. I respectfully ask the court to sentence Mr. Smith the maximum prison term allowed. Thank you, Your Honor, for your time and understanding. [judge] Thank you. You may step down. All right. Uh, Mr. Smith, you are not required to say anything regarding the issue of sentencing, but I am required to give you the opportunity to speak if you want to say anything regarding sentencing. Is there anything you wish to say? - No, ma'am... - All right. All right, um, so the question before the court today is: what's the appropriate sentence as far as incarceration is concerned? In this case, you are no longer a candidate for supervision in the community. So, based on that, I am going to sentence you to be incarcerated for 180 days. [bangs gavel] upbeat music [Carla] He's behind bars; that's what these women wanted to see. And I am thrilled to death he's where he's at. But... [sighs] unfortunately, he's really not gonna be there that long. No-Not at all what he deserves. The judicial system has got so much going on in it, from petty theft to murders, they don't have time for all this little bullshit. And this is little bullshit to them. This is peas. The system is fucked. It's totally fucked up. And it's gonna stay that way. Rick is a bad outcome no matter how you look at it. Some people say he's sick. I don't believe that. I think he knows exactly what he's doing. He enjoys doing what he's doing. Because he likes taking advantage of people. Stark, ambient music [birds singing] [phone line ringing] [geese honking] [phone line ringing] [automated voice] Hello. This is a free call from... [Richard] Scott Smith. [automated voice] ...an inmate at Polk County jail. You have the right to remain silent, and if you choose to speak beyond this point, anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. [lock buzzes] [latch clicks] [door shuts] [officer] Spread your legs right there at the table. - Right here? - Right here. - Spread your legs. - [sighs] Got your cup of water there next to you. [Richard] I agreed to talk to you today because I want to get my story out, and I want everybody in the world knowing that I'm not the person that they've claimed me to be. I'm just not that person. I wanted the serious, I wanted the long-term. I did not want anything short-term and nothing temporary. Anything that I went into, I went into it. I wanted to... some permanency of a relationship. I want the, the fairy tale romance. I want that. I-I want the forever. [Rachel] So it seems like, when you meet someone, things tend to move pretty quickly. Can you talk a little bit about why these relationships happen so fast? [sighs] I just get this, the anxiety, thinking... [clears throat] ...what if this person changes their mind about me? What if, all of a sudden, they meet somebody else, and... somebody else better? That's probably most of it, Rachel, is the fear of losing somebody else in my life would be why I-I would characterize why I would want it to move faster. I don't want to lose anybody else. Um, I have a big fear of people leaving me. And-and for good reason because it's happened to me a lot. More than anything, I just want to be loved. I want to be loved. I want to be wanted. I want to be needed. [Rachel] Do you want to be trusted? Yeah, absolutely. I don't want anybody not to ever trust me. I don't want that. That's not my life. That's not who I want to be. Nor is it... nor am I going to be that. [Rachel] So, you have been described as a con man. [chuckles] Yeah. What-what-what-what-what did I gain? Where's all this, where's all this money at? What did I gain? I didn't gain shit. Check out their pay stubs, their W-2s, their tax returns. Nobody's had any money. I-I-I ended up with the fixer-uppers, the ones that, that are not making a lot of money, that I've had to pay electricity bills, cell phone bills, car insurance, um... car payments. How does that make me a con man when I'm paying for somebody else? It doesn't make sense. [Heidi] But can someone, can-can someone be... can you con someone, uh, out of something besides money? Like, can somebody be conned... emotionally conned, for example? Well, yeah, it-it-it-it could be possible. And from my perspective, hell no. I don't believe that. Emotionally conned? Emotionally conned? Think about that, Heidi. You think it's bullshit? Yeah, absolutely I do. So, have you committed any crimes? No. You believe you've been wrongly accused of every, everything that these women have brought against you? Yeah. [Rachel] So, did you hear anything about this boat? About Oscar's boat? I heard that it sunk. Was I blamed for that one, too? I-I-I heard at first somebody had said that I did something to sink that 1960-something model boat. No, I... no, I don't know anything about it. I was shocked. The boat was in very poor condition. So... - It was in poor condition? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. A very poor condition, very old boat. So... let me just ask you a very plain question. What would you say to the women on the blog? Wow. Well, my life has been very, very difficult at every single turn, which you've created. I really hope that you're satisfied and I hope you're happy with your results, because you got the results that you wanted. But I'm gonna tell you real sure-surely: I'm a diamond. You're not gonna break me. Nobody's gonna break me. I will bounce back, 'cause I still have me. I still have, have my integrity. I'm a new me now. Thank you... thank you for your time, and I forgive you. I forgive you for what you've done to me. - [Rachel] Do you pray? - Yes, every day. Can you tell me about that a little bit? I pray every day. I pray for, uh... [clears throat] my safety, I pray for... as-as I told you, one of the things I pray for, Rachel, is for all these people to get what they want and-and be happy and fulfilled in their life and to move on. Do you, is there, do you have a favorite scripture - that you like to quote, or...? - [sighs] I really don't have a favorite scripture. Um... [clears throat] So why don't you tell me how many times you've been married and... - Five. - In a full sentence, - and please give me their names. - I've been married five times. And what are the names of the... - Angela was my first. - Who was your second? Jennifer was the second. Third? Third? Theresa. Fourth? Jennifer. Um... Does Jennifer go by a different name? No. Okay. Fifth? Jean. So, who is... who...? Uh, Jean. Weren't you married to Lisa? - Lisa? Yeah. - Okay. -Yeah. -Were you married to Lisa after Jean? [clearing throat] Okay. Before Jean. Yeah. Who were you married to between Theresa and Jean? - Lisa. - Lisa. Okay. Um, who's Catherine Pratts? Oh, God, that was very short... [sighs] short-lived. - I forgot all about that. - Mm-hmm. What about Rebecca Sobel? Yep, that was there, too. What number was she? Mm... She was before Jennifer. Who's Rebecca Marie Johnson? She was one, too. Crystal Renee... - ...Wyatt? - Oh, yeah. So that's ten. [Heidi] Have you ever been married to more than one woman at the same time? I think, u-uh, twice. -Can you say that in a complete sentence? -Huh? Can you say that in a complete sentence? Uh, two-two times in the same... two times married, same... [stammers] "I've been married twice to the same..." Twice to sa... yeah, at-at the same time. Can you just say it one time clean for me? [laughs] I've been married to the same... to, uh, two-two people twice. - "At..." - At a time. - "At the same time." - Yeah. You don't like saying it 'cause i-it bothers you, huh? It does bother me 'cause I didn't even realize that happened. [chuckles] You didn't know you were married to two people at the same... No, because I thought, I thought the divorces were done. [chuckles] I really did. - You know... - Is there anyone you're still married to right now that... No. Absolutely not. - You're sure? - I'm positive. [Rachel] So, I want to ask you what aliases you have, and why you were using them? Rick, Scott, Mickey. That's it. So, what... And why were you switching your names around? [inhales] Uh... You know, Rachel, I'm... I'm really glad you asked that question. It's because I have so much fear of somebody googling that name and that damn site coming up. Nothing malicious. I would do anything to avoid that damn site. It-It's very stressful. You know, when... people are getting together on a Friday night for martini night and thinking of ways to make my life-life worse, I think that's sick. I think it's a witch hunt. [clears throat, sniffles] I'm not the only one that's going through this. There's other people... [clears throat] that their lives have been hit on the Internet. You look at our president of our country. Somebody's always got to say something about him. And, you know, he's been accused, or falsely accused, of a lot of things. [stammers, clears throat] I'm human, too. I-I have been a victim, Rachel, to things that are not true. We live in the information superhighway right now. Okay? Everybody googles everybody now. Everybody goes to Facebook and checks-checks you out on Facebook. "Let's-let's look at your family. Let's look at your activities. Let's look at your pictures." All right? Everybody does that. Okay? I'm not on Facebook, and I will never be on Facebook again. I want to be normal. I want to be able to have my Facebook page and have my pictures of my life out there and downloaded off of my phone... [sniffles] ...so it can be... I can feel like I'm a normal person. Um... [clears throat] [Heidi] S-So why does this... why does your story matter? [clears throat] I wanted to help others that may be going through things that are something like this that may not be as strong as I am. 'Cause some people would just, like, maybe suicide would be their option, and maybe just completely check out. That's not what I want. [Heidi] So, is there any kernel of truth in any of this? 'Cause this is, like, I feel like this is your moment to... You want to tell the truth, you want to clear the slate. So I just want to give you every opportunity. If there's anything you want to acknowledge or explain. Look, I'm absolutely ashamed of some of the things and some of my actions, and not telling the truth. And things like... I'm ashamed. I'm embarrassed of myself. And the only thing that I can do is-is-is move forward and-and correct it and it-it never happen again. You know... [clears throat] I can tell you, to... [stammers] I'm-I'm going to work on me, Heidi. I'm going to be in counseling on a regular basis. I am going to do everything in my power to fix me. What do you think needs to be fixed, Scott? [clears throat] I-I-I need to learn that I can be... being myself is okay and be... I can be very content with myself, 'cause being me is okay, is just fine. [exhales, sniffles] I just, I want to move on. I want to heal now. How did you guys see-see this thing ending? How did you guys see this ending?
