 Slow, romantic guitar music... Tempo increases... [waves crashing] [man] Welcome to Belize, a land of great contrast and beauty. Rugged mountain peaks, verdant jungles, clear, impossibly blue waters, white sandy beaches, a tropical paradise where English is the official language and the people are warm and welcoming. This is where the Caribbean begins,

 a rare place that is easy to access. And yet, once you are here, under the warmth of the sun, sand at your feet, time seems to stand still, and you experience the beauty of Belize. Suspenseful music... Hmm. Dramatic, percussive music... [Ellen] We'd only been together about three weeks. I had moved in with him because he said he needed to see me every morning. He need to wake up to me every morning. I don't know. Maybe a couple of weeks later, he says, "This is as good a time as any."

 I said, "For what?" He goes, "Well, let's move to Belize and let's get married." Of course I was all excited, you know, new with him and stuff, and I thought, "Well, I'm-I'm kind of a free spirit. Let's just get up and go, let's do something fun." He found all these houses, he found the prices. The one he was looking up ended up being, like, $1.3 million. And then he ordered two Sea-Doos, six life jackets, a four-wheeler thing, because they said that's how they travel down there. But then he said, just out of the blue, "You know, you cannot be extradited if you go to Belize." I thought that was weird.

[click] [Sandi] Our accommodations stunk, so we went back down. [laughs] Rick griped, and we got the presidential suite. - It's bigger than our house. - Hi, Rick! - It's bigger than our house. - Hi, Rick. [laughs] [Richard] It's bigger than y'all's house! [Sandi] It is big. [Richard] We're moving in. [Sandi] Here's the bellhop right here, putting my clothes away. [Sandi] It started out wonderful. We got engaged. And that's when he just became a totally different person. So I said, "I'm leaving you." I went for the door, and he pushed me, and he pushed me down on the bed, and now he's kind of got me pinned down. I saw him grab something on the bed. It was the iPad. And he just took one swing as hard as he could on my head, and I just kept screaming, and I finally scream, "Please stop. You're going to kill me. You're going to kill me." Tense music... [Richard sighs] Suspenseful music... [woman] Is there a Richard Smith? [woman speaks indistinctly] Richard Smith? [indistinct chatter] Is there a Richard Smith? [door opens and closes] [in distance] Richard Smith? Richard Smith? Richard Smith. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hypnotic music... [Sandi] I'll never forget it. They got him that night, and they took him to the police station. And they said Jean, his wife, keeps calling the police station. Jean, his wife. And that's when I found out that he was already married. Haunting music... [Jean] I get this call. He told me that he had been jumped... and he's saying, "They picked me up, and they're blaming me for everything. They're putting me in jail, and you need to come and get me." I'm hearing what he was arrested for, which makes no sense to me because it was domestic abuse. And I said, "Well, that's not likely, since I'm his wife, and he didn't beat me up." Sandi found me, and she told me what really happened. And then I read the blog. And I realized that I was just part of a huge game. But I wasn't alone. [Sandi] Where did you guys first meet? - The first time? Uh... - Yes. Well, we met in Wichita, at a restaurant. He just kept saying, "You know what? You're everything. You're the package. You're the package. You're exactly what I've been looking for." Then he wanted me to quit my job because we were going to go to Belize. Oh, Belize? - Oh, brother. - [Ellen] Pictures, I had paperwork, we had signatures. He knew. [Tracy] He was going to Guatemala when he met me. [laughter] - Oh, my gosh. - He's full of shit. [Ellen] So, has there been people after me, I wonder? [Sandi] Oh, I'm sure. [Ellen] I mean, but we don't know that. [Sandi] We don't know that. [Sabrina] When did he disappear from Wichita? [Ellen] The last time I saw him was the 19th. - [Sabrina] Where did he go? - I have no idea. I left. [Sabrina] You mean, he just up and just disappeared? [Ellen] I don't know. I left. But you know, I thought it very strange, because when I found the blog, I went to confront him, and then he goes, "I want you to talk to somebody. A woman named Lee out of Knoxville, Tennessee." And she could not say enough nice things about him. Lee took up for him. So I still think he's with Lee. She's got money, and she liked him. Slow, suspenseful music... [Jean] Lee. I don't know what, totally, to make of her. Some of the other women have talked to her before. They told me that she had been engaged to him... ...and that she was very much in love with him. I think something's going on. She knows something. [line ringing] Hi, is this Lee? Hi, Lee. This is Jean Hansen. I've had a lot of people talking to me and asking questions and stuff. Um, they're trying to figure out where Rick is. Do you know where... anything about this? Scott. Sorry, that's right. I forg... I keep forgetting. You knew him as Scott. Well, how often do you even get the chance to talk to him? So... So, he's not in Knoxville? [Jean] I absolutely, without a doubt, think she knows where he is. There's not a doubt in my mind, because of the way she handled that phone call. Contemplative music... [Steven] So, we've been following Lee for about 48 hours... ...and there's no sign of Scott. You know, he may go underground for a short period of time, but I-I believe that he's got needs in life. Uh, he needs a place to stay, he needs a vehicle. Uh, he needs some money. So he'll stay on the grid, and, um, I think eventually everybody can be located. [radio chirps] I'm pulling in to Lee's house right now. Okay. We'll stay stationary here. This is... Richard Scott Smith background check. Let's see. One, two, three, four, eight, nine, ten different socials showing up. Looks like he's had about 43 different phone numbers. There's about 58 different addresses on here. He spends very little time in each one of them. [sighs] Yeah, he just moves with the wind. But if he is in the area, my gut instinct is telling me that we stay with Lee, and she'll eventually lead us to him. [insects chirping] Atmospheric music... [line ringing] [wind chimes jingling] [Lee] I had gotten divorced, and my life was just boring. I'd become very much of a recluse. Once he and I started dating, we went out all the time. I mean, I got to dress up again. Do you remember the show Melrose Place? Heather Locklear's character? That was me. Professional on top, hooker on the bottom. And it was not even a bad breakup. You know, I'm fortunate that we still are friends and we don't have anything bad to say about each other. So this blog, I was certainly upset about what he was being accused of doing, because I thought, "This cannot be the person I know." It seems like a witch hunt to me, because I think Scott is just looking for love. He wants to be part of a family. And I've always known that. He called my parents Mom and Dad. He's very close with my father, who's into boating, and so is Scott, and they have a loving relationship. As my father would say, "He's a son-in-law I wish I had," to this day. I actually do not know. I don't. [water bubbling] Intriguing music... [Lee] I mean, she's been a little pissed off today, except... been picking snails. There he is, there's one of 'em. - See, he... - He's sharp. There's... there he goes. There's two of them. [Lee] Which one is that? - You know, that's you. - Goldie. That's Snuggle Bug. What do we call them? Our aqua babies. I'll talk to you tomorrow. - [kiss] - [Lee] Bye. Love you. [Darryl] Love you, too, have a good time. - I will. - [chuckles] - I love you, too. - I'll see you. Eerie music... This is a really good picture of my mother and I. My mother was a walking pharmacy. There's the relationship you can see my mother and I had drinking. It's sad. And I have tried to deal with it as best I can. Scott used to say, "We're gonna have to get through it together." And I thank him every day for that. Because he has been through the same thing. [gates creaking] [slow footsteps] [wind chimes tinkling] [teakettle whistling] [bell clanging] [fly buzzing] [birds chirping] [thunder rumbling] [cow moos] [Toni] Scott is my brother. And there's about 20 years' difference between the two of us. When I was 12, our mother passed away, and I ended up moving in with Scott. It was the scariest time of my life. And Scott was the person I trusted the most. Scott was jumping from woman to woman. And he was telling them that I was his daughter. He used me as a tool to play at their heartstrings, to get them to feel sorry for him, maybe want to be with him more, because, oh, look, he's a single dad. He's trying hard. It's like a game of chess for him. Everything's a chip that can be moved and manipulated. I was just another pawn for him to put into play. He'd say, "You're awful. You're nothing. You're never going to amount to anything." Um, "You're trailer trash. I don't see why Mom kept you around." And then he became violent. He has no idea where I am other than the state of Texas. And I don't want to be found by him. Because I don't want to live with a monster in my life. Atmospheric music... [Katie] I hadn't seen Scott in 27 years. Maybe three years ago, I was on Facebook and got a message. And you know, immediately, I type back, "Scotty, you... you finally... you tracked me down." [Kemmy] Katie and I had thought, "My goodness. This is wonderful. He's back, and we can be a family again." [Katie] He told me it was his first chance at really having a family. I was never able to have children, and he'd say, "You're the closest thing I've got to a mom." Then he started introducing me, if we'd be out to dinner some place, "This is my mother." [Kemmy] He has this way of making people believe he is sincere. And I think that's why it was so easy to con me and everybody else. Katie's husband is my brother Wally. Wally was in the service during Vietnam, and he ended up with a brain condition from the different chemicals and all that. Wally had been in the hospital, and Scott jumps in to be a hero and takes Wally's medical power of attorney, everything, trying to sign Wally into a home and get his home, take his home. He sold off some of my brother's possessions. His own uncle. [bird squawking] And he tried to turn us all against each other. [sighs] It hurt me so emotionally. I didn't think I was that bad at reading, but as I said, I was an easy target. A-And he knew that. You know, I may hate him for all these things, but... I wouldn't have gotten in so deep if I hadn't thought I loved him. Atmospheric music... Suspenseful music... [woman] Oh, my God. [Jason] That's our guy. [Jason] All right, he came out, Steven, and he's wearing a polo, blue jeans. He's mobile. [Steven] All right. You guys got everything you need? - [woman 1] Yeah. - [woman 2] Yes. [woman 1] Okay, you just follow the car. Don't worry about us. [Steven] All right, so he's gonna go out on the Mercedes side? [Jason] Yeah. [Steven] Come on, dude. Okay... Oh. Okay, I got him. Absolutely not. The last thing that you want to do is tip the subject off and blow it. We need to gather intelligence about his everyday life. We're gonna make sure that we know his patterns, we know his behavior before we get the authorities involved. Because we're only gonna get one shot at getting him arrested. Disorienting music... Yeah, we're sitting in the parking lot. - -[dialogue inaudible] [Natalie] Yeah. I got three major pet peeves: liars, cheaters and thieves. So I can completely empathize with the women that this asshole is fucking with. - -[dialogue inaudible] Suspenseful music... [Heidi] Who's that in the white car? It also says that the vehicle that Richard Scott Smith is driving actually belonged to Oscar. Yeah. Dramatic music... [phone line ringing] Energetic music... [birds chirping] [Darryl] I've been dating Lee for three years. And today, all of a sudden, I get a text saying we're no longer a couple. We're done. [exhales sharply] I didn't have this problem till he showed up. It's just like, that's where she's focused at in her mind. Scott, Scott, Scott. Gentle music... I met Lee through a friend of a friend. I believe it was on Facebook. I thought she was very attractive. Very sweet person, very likable person, but she has a problem with alcohol. When she starts drinking, she's easy to take advantage of. So, a couple of weeks ago, Scott called, supposedly needing a place to stay and everything, and she okayed it for him to come there at their condo and stay for a couple of days, and had her dad go to the bus station and pick him up, and I was unaware of the whole thing. Oscar is a good man, but Oscar's getting some age on him, and sometimes he don't remember what he said that day to the next. All of a sudden, Scott's calling Oscar "Dad," saying "I love you" and all that stuff to him. That's very weird. The love part's a lie. A con man's a lie. That's... there's no truth in him. You don't go around doing people that way and s... and it's love. Love is for real. Love-love will stay with you forever, if it's love. I don't try to judge people or pass judgment on people. It's just, I-I see the facts of this thing. It's there, it... the writing's on the wall. I've told Lee that. I told her, I says, "You wake up and all your assets are gone and you're kicked out in the store and he's sitting there, holding the money bag?" I said, "I've told you before this ever happened. That's a con man." suspenseful music... [Steven] We're coming up on the roundabout to go to, probably, west on Northshore. [radio chirps] [Steven] He's gonna be, uh, taking a left into Weigel's. [Steven] There he is. See him, on the phone? He just got over in the number two. One thing that I've already noticed, his rearview mirror is positioned in such a way that the only thing that he can see is his hair and his sunglasses. So, as he drives down the road, I have never seen his rearview mirror positioned in a way that he can see out of his back window. Which is great for us, because, you know, he's not looking behind him to see if anybody's following him. You know, typically, with a sociopath, you definitely got some narcissism. They only care about themselves, the way that they look, what they can gain. They don't take into consideration the feelings of the person that they're hurting. And they typically do hurt a lot of people. Then, of course, nothing is ever their fault, you know? Even if they're the common denominator in a dozen or more scenarios, it's never their fault.
