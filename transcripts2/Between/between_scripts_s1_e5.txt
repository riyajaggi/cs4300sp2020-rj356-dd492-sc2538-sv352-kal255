Everything, including our kiss, was a mistake. I was feeling sorry for you. I didn't realize I was taking advantage of you. This is what happens when you steal. Hey, you okay?

 - Hanna? - You know her? Harrison, wake up! - What happened? - He went into insulin shock. I'm so sorry, I didn't know. You did this? Nobody made you judge and jury. I am looking after your baby. Trust me, you are not gonna have to deal with me anymore! - You can always stay at our place. - Why not? Don't touch it! Come on, Ronnie, people might need those drugs. Ronnie? Hey, do you mind driving me to town? I think I've overstayed my welcome here.

 I can't. There's something I need you to do for us first. Amy! I need intel on a kid named Adam Jones. Our cousin Annie needs help. What happened? She cut her leg and it went from bad to worse. Without antibiotics, she'll die. Why do you need me? At this point, any Creeker who tries to show his or her face in town is risking getting shot at. You're one of them. Okay. Try to get Rifampin. If you can't, I wrote down others. - I can take him now. - We don't think that's the best idea. You trying to go in and out of town with the baby. You know... - You're not asking, are you? - With what Ronnie tried to do to you, you have more reason to leave and never come back. So Jason is the insurance policy. You're holding my baby hostage. We're sorry. I thought you two were different. synced and corrected by Caio www.addic7ed.com I heard you came looking for me. Sort of. How's the baby? Jason's fine. You named him? Yeah. It was time to step up my mothering game. Hey, I'm sorry. Me, too. Okay. So, I have something I need to do right now, but maybe later, if you're not too busy... Definitely. I'll come by your place. I don't think I can handle too much more of Saint Melissa. Stay as long as you like. See you around. Sure, square. Room 14. C Block. You getting any texts? No, nothing. How do we have power but the phones still don't work? I don't know. I don't think the power going out was an accident. Not if they can turn it back on and keep cell service off. Yeah, you... you might be onto something. You okay? Vince, what's wrong? Vince. You seemed so mysterious back in school. - Yeah? - No, it's true. Don't take it the wrong way. It's just that the whole Mennonite thing... it just made all of you seem like foreigners. What? I know. I'm sorry that sounded kind of prejudiced, but... it's just that you all stayed so close together and no one saw you outside of school. Didn't you ever feel, I don't know, different? Not at first, no. Then... sure. I wondered what it would be like to ride in a car... wear clothes bought from the Gap, eat McDonald's, go to regular high school. So... what's your plan? Do you need a ride back to your... - Community? - Right, yeah. No. I guess I'm not getting more of an explanation than that, am I? Well, if you want... you can stay here. Gord? We have a problem. Well, obviously, the antibiotics aren't working. Every last one of them now has mastitis. How bad is it, Gord? If we can't get this under control, we lose our only source of milk inside the fence. When we had problems with the animals, my father used a liniment oil. Worked wonders. Even for something like this? Pretty much for everything. Worth a try. Who's that? Gord, we, uh... we need your help. I'm dealing with a few things here. It's Vince. He's in pretty bad shape. I can drive you to your farm. - You can drive? - Yeah, ever since the quarantine. That would help. Okay. Ronnie? Ronnie? - What are you doing? Stop. - Get out of here. I need that! No. Maybe some pain will do you some good. Remind you what you tried to do to Wiley. If Mom and Dad could see you now. Well, I guess it's a good thing that they're dead. What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you, Ronnie? When did you become a monster? You don't think it's the virus? - I hear Ms. Symonds, she... - Yeah, I know. I thought the government was just being paranoid. I thought we were done with all this virus shit. Apparently not. But Vince doesn't have it. If he did, he'd be dead already. Hey, Vin. How you doing, buddy? I feel like I'm dying. Tell me where it hurts, okay? Everywhere. My stomach. If you can't help me, then shoot me. Sorry. Sorry. Just breathe, breathe. Hey. Hey, buddy. It's his appendix. My guess, it's burst. How do you know? Mine ruptured two years ago. It's gonna kill him, isn't it? There's nothing we can do. Not without a hospital. Okay, a hospital. - What? - We get him to a hospital. - Oh, gee, why didn't I think of that? - I'm serious, Gord. We load him up in Ted Metz's plane and I fly him over the fence myself. Chuck, that's way too dangerous. It can't be that hard. It's suicide. I know how to fly. My grandfather, he, uh... he gave me a few lessons. I'll take him. Are you sure? Yeah. No shit. Come on. Shit! - We'll get you out of here soon. - You'll be okay, man. - Okay. - Okay. What the hell are you doing here? What happened? Please tell me it's not the virus again. No. No, we think his appendix burst. Where you been? Your sister's worried. Around. Taking a break from things. Oh, yeah? Rumor has it you're staying out at the Creekers'. Yeah, sort of, I guess. Seriously, Wiley? It's only temporary. I'm leaving as soon as I get them some medicine. Excuse me? Ever since you shot at Pat, they don't exactly feel welcome in town. So they sent me. I just need some antibiotics. Yeah, not from here. Come on. There's a little girl with a leg so swollen, she might die. Oh, yeah? And Ronnie has come in here and pretty much helped himself to whatever he pleased. The Creekers aren't getting another thing. - You don't know it was Ronnie. - It's true, Wiley. The other day, when I caught him stealing, his bag was full of pills. - Well, I swear this is not for him. - Vince needs Oxy. Oxy that Ronnie is pretty much baked on. So you tell him to come here and return what he stole, and then maybe we'll discuss it. All right. Come on. Come and get it, Jack! Jack? Jack! Come on, boy! Jack! Jack! Jack! Chuck, I know how you feel. He's like a... a brother to you. But even with the remote possibility that Kevin can fly the plane, which I seriously doubt, who's to say that they won't get shot out of the sky? Come on, what sort of conspiracy theories are you smoking, Gord? Besides, you have a better idea? Let Vince die? You know how much pain he's in. So what? We're just gonna stand there and watch him suffer? It's a death wish. No, it is actually doing something. What is your solution? Thought so. Go back to your farm, Gord. It was a mistake sending for you in the first place. No, it's okay. Oh, baby. It's okay. It's all right. Shit. There you go. It's okay, baby. Oh, there's a smile. Ronnie? It's okay. It's okay. Do you need any help? No, I'm fine. You should've stayed in the truck. I thought something happened to you. - You said you'd be right back. - Okay. - What's going on? - Get down. Morning, John! I got it. What happens if they catch us stealing? We're not stealing. This is mine. Okay, he's clear. Let's go. The Creekers? I could go down there again, talk to her. Maybe she'll come back. No. Either she'll get it or she won't. I should've just kept my mouth shut. I miss the baby. None of this is working. Hey, Mel. Easy. You're one of the good ones. You really think so? Definitely. Just look at all the things you're doing with the kids. I should go. You sure? Yeah. You okay in there? I need help. Please. Hey! That's my dog! - It's okay. Here. - Why do you have my dog? You know he's my dog, right? My address is on the tag. And it also says that his name is Jack and I live at the same address. - So that proves it. - Yeah, it certainly does. I was actually just heading to the address to see if anybody still lived there. I'm happy I found you 'cause I was worried he was a stray or something. No! No! He's definitely not a stray. Come on, Jack. - Jack escaped. - Really? He's not allowed to roam free, or else he'll be killed. I am supposed to be very careful. - Mmm-hmm. - But sometimes I'm not so careful. Like this morning, I left the front door open. You won't tell Chuck, will you? Chuck? Chuck's my brother. He says he's my father and mother, too, because they died. He makes me hamburgers whenever I want. I can't make them anymore. Do you have a brother? Yeah, I do. - What's his name? - Harrison. Was that the same Harrison who stole the car? Yeah. I remember you. Chuck says that was wrong. Very wrong. But he was more wrong to Harrison. - Chuck said that? - Yup. Time to feed Jack. Bye! I'll give Ronnie credit. Even when he's trying to do the right thing, he manages to screw it all up. You can't pin all this on him. For one, he's an addict. Secondly, I watched him do it. It never occurred to me that flushing the pills would be a problem. Or that Chuck would tell Wiley, "No Oxy, no meds for Annie." How's Annie? Her fever's getting higher. Wiley and I will go back into town tonight. Why not just sneak into town by yourself, get the drugs? Forget about Wiley altogether. You don't need her. Look, she's our insurance policy in case things go sideways. Rumor has it, Chuck has half the hockey team armed. Are you saying what I think you're saying? I doubt it'll come to that. If it does? If I get caught, you think anyone's gonna bother asking questions first? At least Wiley'll buy me some negotiating power. You okay, Kev? You sure about this? Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh... Just give me a second. You don't have to do this, you know. I'm fine, Chuck. This'll work. Yeah. When you make it across... remind the world about us. Okay, Vince... here we go. Just hang in there, buddy. Going somewhere? You scared me. You still didn't answer the question. I... I just wanted to get some fresh air. It doesn't look like that to me. Please, let me go. Here, take these. Annie still needs the drugs whether you stay or you go. They can't do that. Just shoot the plane down. It wasn't even close to the border. I warned you this would happen! - Not now, Gord. - So when, Chuck? Yesterday, you almost killed a guy by stringing him up. And today... These deaths are on your head. You go to hell! At least I make decisions around here instead of hiding at my farm at the first sign of trouble. Right. That's why I got shot at the Creekers', huh? Just because you show up once doesn't mean you're all in, Gord. I am trying to make it work... and you're just tearing it down! Maybe it's time for someone else to make the tough decisions around here. Not just the rich kid. Well, it's not gonna be the pig farmer. They're cows, junior. Same pile of shit. Time to leave, Chuck. Go back to the mansion. Make me. Go home, Gord. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it! Where's the car? Wiley took it. What? Why didn't you stop her? Because I knew she'd come back. She was never gonna let a little girl suffer. Frances said you were in here. That bad, huh? How's the other guy? Better than me. I, uh... was never much of a fighter. How did your parents die? Just like everybody else's, I suppose. It was quick. My father couldn't wait for that. He hung himself. Didn't leave a note. Didn't say goodbye. Sit down. You're the one that runs the orphanage, right? Uh, yeah. Kids are down for the night. - Can I get a beer? - You don't seem like the drinking type. It's been a long couple of weeks. Sure. It's on the house. Hey, Chuck. You want to play Crazy Eights? Amanda, not now. Okay. When? Later. - What time later? - I don't know. I don't know. Later, okay? 9:25 later? Sure. If that doesn't work, 9:30 or 9:45? Yeah, sure, whatever. Well? Which one? Amanda, honestly, it doesn't matter, okay? I don't care. Chuck! It's important to care of a time. Well, which one? Amanda, stop being a baby! You stop being a baby, too! Please, don't shoot! What are you doing here? Nothing. This is the last place you should be. Okay, then I'll just leave. You're not going anywhere, Adam. Open the knapsack. Slowly. - Another? - Uh, no. I gotta pick up some stuff for the kids at the pharmacy. Oh, come on. Have one more. - Nah, you should stay. - Hey. Whoa, whoa. I didn't mean anything. I'm sorry. I just... I really enjoyed talking to you. You're different in a good way. Uh, yeah. Just... I should go. There's no antibiotics. Yeah, I don't see any either. You think they knew we were coming? Bingo. Wiley. Hey, we got what we came for. Nothing else. It's stealing. A little girl's gonna die. Does that not matter to you? Everyone knows Ronnie stole the drugs. The Creekers don't need more. That was Ronnie, not the rest of us. We're not asking. You can stay, Wiley. You don't have to do this. Yes, I do. And not because I have to, but because I should. As if we don't have enough trouble without you stirring up more? Did you cut off her finger and steal that ring? Ronnie here thinks he can steal from people. Come on, Ronnie, people might need those drugs. What I have with Chuck is great... Take it easy, Ronnie. Use your head. Never touch my sister again! The only way you could get a girl is to rape her! - Stop it! Stop it! - You're not better than me! Shut up. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Jack! You think Melissa's gonna tell anyone? Uh, I don't know. - No. - Yeah, I hope not. It'll just stir the pot more. Jack! Ronnie's such an idiot. None of this would've happened - if it wasn't for... - Watch out! Amanda! Ugh! Help! Help me! She just ran into the road. I didn't see her. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Where'd she come from? She didn't see the car? I don't know! Amanda, come on! Amanda! So, I think we stay here from now on. Take care of the farm. Stay out of town. That sounds like a good idea. - What about milk deliveries? - They can come to us. - But, Gord... - I'm done, Franny. There's no talking any sense into Chuck. And the Creekers? They... Look, if they wanna kill each other, fine. But I don't want any of us hurt because of it. We have more than enough supplies to last. Let's eat. She's dead. What are we gonna do? We have to leave. No... No, we have to stay. We have to tell them the truth. Chuck's already shot at me once. We just killed his sister, all right? He's not gonna wait around to talk. Well, I'll talk to him, okay? He'll listen to me! No, he won't. All right, someone's bound to come any minute. There's nothing we can do for her right now. And trust me, if they find us here, we're dead. Damn it! Come on. I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. You know, you're the last person I expected to see. Yeah... I... I wanted to explain to you that... when I finally got Harrison to tell me exactly what happened, I figured out that things weren't quite as black and white as they seemed. And I can tell that things went downhill pretty quickly. I don't know. I... I guess what I'm trying to say is that it wasn't entirely your fault and... No, no, no. It... I was an idiot. I mean, you don't do that to a kid. But I'm... I'm sorry, I... It wasn't right. What? You passed the test. - Test? - Yeah. My mom always used to say that if a guy could admit that he was wrong, then... there's hope for him. Or something. Wanna come in? Yeah. Yeah, I... Okay. Okay. Wow. Must've been nice, growing up rich. I mean, not to sound like a jerk or anything, but... I never really thought about it. It just... seemed normal, you know? Hmm. I don't want to do this anymore. What do you mean? It's obvious, isn't it? I'm not a leader. Everything I do, I screw up. I almost got your brother killed, and Pat. And if I had listened to Gord, then... Kevin would still be alive. You know, maybe even Vince. Everything's going to shit. And it's pretty clear that I'm part of the problem. You know, I used to think that just because my father... owned so much of this town that... that I should be the one to take charge. And now... What is it? It's Amanda. Hello. Can I help you? I apologize for the late hour, but you have something that belongs to me. What are you talking about? The liniment oil? I'm not here for the oil. I'm here for my wife... Hanna. No, it's okay. Shut that baby up! Ronnie, what are you doing? I can't take this! Shut it up! He's not gonna calm down if you're yelling, okay? No, you're tricking me. It's a trick. Shut it up! What's a trick, Ronnie? Ronnie, you have to trust me. No, you hit me with a shovel! I'm sorry, okay? Don't apologize. What's wrong with me? Why did I do it? Just give me the knife, okay? No. No. Ronnie, no. I've done such awful things. Ronnie, don't! You said yourself, Mom and Dad would be ashamed of me. Right? I'm not. You're trying to make it right. That has to count for something. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm sorry. Amanda, I'm so sorry. Adam. I just want to ask you a few questions. What do you know about Art Carey? I found a canister on his body. I think it might be involved in the deaths. Whatever this is... I don't think it's natural. I think he made it. You're a smart kid. Did you tell anyone else about this? No. But if we do, it may point people in the right direction for a cure. We can expose what Carey was doing. And why would I want to do that? I'm on his side. Please. Adam. Dad. synced and corrected by Caio www.addic7ed.com
