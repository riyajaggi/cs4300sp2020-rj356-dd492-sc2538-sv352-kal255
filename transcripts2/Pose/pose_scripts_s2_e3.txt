 We're recording. It's Tuesday, May 1. I'm here with Angel, hometown the Bronx. Congratulations, Angel. We had hundreds of applicants, and only five made it through to this final round. That's quite the feat. Why do you deserve to be the Fresh Face of 1990? I don't know. 'Cause I'm a natural beauty. And you don't got to beat my mug for me to be camera ready.

 "Beat my mug"? Yeah. You know. - Oh, vogue. - Mm-hmm. - That's quite on trend. - Like that. That's all my clients are talking about. But what else can you offer as a Fresh Face? My heart. Um, when a friend is having a hard time, they call me. And I give pretty good advice. Well, that's all the questions I have. Thank you for your time. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

 You didn't even ask me why I want to be a Fresh Face of 1990. When was the last time you've seen somebody that looked like me be the face of a campaign? I know I'm not as polished as these other girls. But that don't mean that I want this any less. I grew up in a home where I was told that I would never amount to anything. For a long time... I believed it. Sometimes I still do. And I want to be an example to... to everybody... that's told that they're worthless. That they can make something of themselves. Help me prove them wrong, Ms. Ford. Pick me. Oh, hey, Angel. Where have you been, girl? Papi told me you went for that modeling campaign. - Good luck with that, girl. - Thank you. I'm rooting for you. The category is... Femme Queen Runway. I need to see you bitches stomping down this runway in your best 501s, honey. Hey, how'd it go? - I think I got it. - Ooh! Ain't nobody coming between you and your Calvins, honey. Aw... shoot. Come on, now, Miss Angel. Serving us them good genes, baby. And I'm talking about denim... and skin. Ah, y'all like that double entendre? Catch it, catch it, baby. Ooh... Yes. Judges, your scores. Ten, ten, ten, ten... ten! You know it don't get no better than that, baby. Come on, get this trophy. Just take it on home, honey. She branching out into the world, y'all. She makes her own decisions. Yeah, honey, it's your prerogative. ♪ Make my own decisions... ♪ The Evangelistas are turning it tonight. ♪ That's my prerogative. ♪ You want that... that arch? Hell, you look like one of them catalogue girls. Ain't nobody gonna be in no catalogue. - Why? They don't pay or something? - No. 'Cause I want to be in a magazine. I'm a magazine girl. Damon, get that phone. Oh, my goodness. Angel, it's for you. Oh, my God, it's Ms. Ford. Okay. Thank you. Bye. What'd they say? Just... Pap. Pap, Pap, stop. Oh. - Baby girl, I... - Angel. - I'm so sorry, Angel. - That lady must be blind or something. Nah, she is wrong. I'm-a give her - a piece of my mind. - Stop it. I'm tired of your scheming and your big plans and your stupid dreams. You always putting shit in our minds to make us think that we deserve more. Why don't you just focus on yourself? Just... leave me alone. - Don't worry, I got it. - Mm-hmm. You okay? Yeah. The category is... Live... Work...
