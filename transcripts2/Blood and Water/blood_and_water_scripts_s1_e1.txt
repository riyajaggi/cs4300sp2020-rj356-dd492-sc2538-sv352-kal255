 [IN ZULU] Yes, Mom. [IN ENGLISH] Listen, have you seen the matches? I'll get them. [EXHALES] [MUFFLED HEARTBEAT] [PHONE CHIMES] [PHONE CHIMES] - [LAUGHS SOFTLY] - [KEYBOARD CLACKING] - [PHONE CHIMES] - [CHUCKLES] [SCOFFS] Sis, he's here! Sis! ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ ♪ Happy birthday dear Phume ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - [WOMAN] Hip hip hip! - [ALL] Hooray! [IN ZULU] Welcome all. [IN ENGLISH] Thank you all for being here today. It really means a lot to us. Thank you, especially, to those of you who have been here on the 16th of August for every single year since our beautiful little baby girl was born. Seventeen years is a long time to look for someone. But we'll go another 17 if it means I get to hold my beautiful first-born girl in my arms again. So please, when you do pray... just ask God to bring her home. To make sure that those who took her are brought to justice. Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Puleng... [EXHALES] Don't forget to make a wish for your sister. Three... two... one. [BLOWS] [THEME SONG PLAYING] ♪ Blood ♪ ♪ Blood and water ♪ - [SIYA] Books again? - [DAD] Take a break from that Xbox. [SIYA] "There's nothing like looking if you want to find something." Love, Dad." [LAUGHS] At least this one has pictures. [BOTH LAUGH] And you, Makhu. If you want to achieve something in life, first you must... - Write it down, I know. - That's right. Now, open it. What does it say? "There is no greater agony than the untold story inside you. Maya Angelou. Keep hoping, love, Dad." Thanks, Baba. - Can I see yours? - Oh, my God. Yours is more boring than mine. Don't be stupid, Siya. It's supposed to be empty. - All right. All right. All right. - That's not a nice word. Are you staying over this time? Puleng, I think you need to be patient with us. We're gonna work something out. I promise you. [DAD] I'll be back just now. Hmm? [PHONE CHIMES] [PHONE CHIMING] [PULENG SCOFFS] This girl. Wow, Zama, wear less. Puleng, whatevs. So, I met this guy Chris, all right? He's 17, he's rich, he loves to travel, he loves to party, and he likes my ass. So basically everything you love? Yeah, exactly. Friend, can you please go with me to his party? Babe, I can't. The Khumalo National Day of Mourning forbids it. Okay, let me know if you change your mind. [ZAMA] W-w-w-wait, before you go, is this a yay or a nay? Puleng? It's a nay for me. Sorry, Zama, I... I'll call you back, okay? I have to go. Why is he leaving already? He'll be back soon, okay? Don't worry. Everything will be fine. [IN ZULU] Dad left. [IN ENGLISH] I know. - You told him to go, didn't you? - He said he had somewhere to go. - Why does Phume get such a big cake? - What? Siya went to Spur for his birthday, but Phume gets a three-tiered cake and she's not even here. Go and gather up the dishes... - Ma... - Go! I'm going to Zama's. You're not going anywhere. We've got guests. Puleng! Puleng! [KEYBOARD CLACKING] [PHONE CHIMES] ♪ Funny thing about love is One day it's here... ♪ [ZAMA WHISPERING] Come, come, come, come! ♪ One day it's gone ♪ ♪ Funny thing about you is You were the one ♪ [ZAMA] You can say it, you know. You'll feel better. [SIGHS] What? You're like, "Fuck!" - Zama. - What? [PULENG LAUGHS] [IN XHOSA] This girl. How did things go this year? - [SIGHS] - Do you want to talk about it? Nah. Same old. So, Chris, that guy's totally into me. I mean, why else am I on the VIP list? Wait, there's a VIP list for a house party? Yeah. Maybe that's how people do it in Llandudno. Llandudno? Zama, why are we going so far? Am I even on this guest list? I don't know. We'll see when we get there. Relax, it's going to be fine. So, how did you meet him? He DM'd me. [LAUGHS] Okay. I was stalking his Instagram profile, and I accidentally liked a picture he posted, like, 35 weeks ago. I wanted to die. Who's going to be at this party? I mean... [SIGHS] What if these people are dodgy? Definitely no one we know, and rich people can't be dodgy. You barely know this guy. Like, what's his surname? [IN ZULU] Drink. [IN ENGLISH] We'll ask questions later. [IN ZULU] Drink, girl, drink.

Zama can come in, but Puleng, you're not in the list. What? - [EXHALES] I knew it. I'll just go home. - No, no, no, friend, wait. Wait. Give me five seconds, I'll be back right now, okay? Give me five seconds. Trust me. You can't just leave me here. Stop there. Next, come. God. - [EXHALES] - [PHONE VIBRATES] [PHONE CHIMES] P! Uh, Addie. It's... It's fine. - You can let her in. - Come in. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Three, two, one, go. Ah. Yaas, bitch! Let's, uh, get out of here. Okay. Friend, I'll catch you later. Zama? - Ow! - Oh. - Ow. - Shit, oh, shit. I'm so sorry again. Oh, shit. Let me just... No, it's fine. It's fine. I see you made a new friend. Does she want kush? Seventy bucks. It's worth it. No, thank you. Try not to burn her clothes next time, and maybe she'll fuck you. [PULENG] Pardon me. [PULENG] Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me, sorry. [CROWD CHEERS] Hello? Can I please have a cider? Hello? - Can I please have a drink? - Wow. [GIRL SCOFFS] Mind if I try? [PULENG SCOFFS] Hey, Jono. Can I have a cider, please? Of course. What are you having? Me?

How much for the cider? [SOFTLY] Okay, no? Cute cardi, by the way. [DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [ZAMA MOANING] Ew. Shit. Puleng? Friend? Friend, wait. - She can join if she wants. - [ZAMA] I'm so sorry about that. Is everything okay? Yeah, I'm just trying to unsee what I just saw. Um... Wait, did... did he just say I could join in if I want? [LAUGHS] Well, what can I say? I know how to pick them. Lord. Uh, look, friend, I'm so sorry for leaving you hanging. I will find you around when I'm done. - Done? Ew. Ew, Zama. - Yes. - Give me a kiss. Give me... - Ew. Bye! Ugh! [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] [SIGHS] [FIKILE] I shouldn't even be here. There's too many people. [GUY] So then, tell me to leave. [FIKILE] Is this even real? 'Cause if it is, I'm all in. [GUY] This is real. [KISSING, MOANING] [GUY] Someone's here. [PHONE VIBRATING] [PHONE CONTINUES VIBRATING] Does this phone belong to anyone? [EXHALES] Hello? [WOMAN] Wade? Wade? Uh... Wade is not here. This is Puleng speaking. Just put Wade on. It's his mother. Please, it's urgent. Does anyone know where Wade is? He's by the photo booth. [HIP-HOP MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [PULENG] Wade? Uh, just one second. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING] Yes, who's looking for me? Oh. Hi. [SCOFFS] Not me. Mommy. Dude, she's waiting. Oh. Oh. Mo... Mommy. Hi, Mom. [STAMMERING] Where are you? You should've been home hours ago! Did you conveniently forget that you've got a curfew? - I'm sorry. - I want you home right now! - I'm sorry. - Do you hear me? - Yes, I will. - Right now! Bye-bye. So, um... Where did you find it? - [CHUCKLES] In the couch. - In the... [EXHALES] Of course. Um, please, can I get... Can I get you another drink? Another cider, maybe? [SIGHS] They're all out. I tried already. Okay, how is this? If I can get you a cider, will you help me pack up? Depends. How quickly can you get that cider? Voila. That's cheating. I didn't know there were rules. [LAUGHS] I... I'm Wade. You are? Puleng. Puleng. Okay. [PULENG] How do you know Chris? Um, we're at the same school, Parkhurst College. We're not friends or anything. He just asked me to do the photo booth thing. - Hmm. - And you? I'm a plus one. It's a long story. [CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS] Ah, no. - Please don't. I hate pictures of myself. - [CHUCKLES] Oh, wow. [SCOFFS] That's actually not bad. - You're really good at this. - [LAUGHS] Um, I have a great subject. Do you... know this girl? Um... You remind me of her. Like the shape of your faces and something about your eyes. [PULENG] What? She's way too pretty. [WADE] She's a'ight. - Yes, you're right, she's totally hideous. - Mm. [LAUGHS] [CHRIS] Yo, everyone. Move closer. Fiks, make your way up, please. Fiks? Fiks? Ladies and gentlemen, your birthday girl, Fikile Bhele. That's Fikile, the one I was just talking about. It's her birthday, of course, if you didn't know. [CHRIS] Happy 17th birthday, you old hag. I love you. Now, let's drink! Is it Fikile's birthday today or during the week? Uh, it's today. [PULENG] She shares the same birthday as my sister. Ah! That's cool. Where is she? Oh, uh, she's out with some friends, I think. [PHONE CHIMES] Shit. Um, I have to go. Puleng, it was awesome meeting you. I would love to stay in touch with you on Instagram or something. Yeah, just search "that Puleng." That Puleng. Okay. Okay, bye. [MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING] [FIREWORKS EXPLODING] [MUSIC FADES OUT] [EXHALES] [EXHALES] [LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS] Ma. [CLEARS THROAT] I'm sorry. I didn't wanna wake you. When we have a house full of guests I expect you to stay home. You could have at least responded to my texts, Puleng, I had to find out from Zama that you were fine. I just needed to clear my head. What's really going on, Puleng? Seems like all we do is fight. Hey. You know how much this day means to us... How much it means to you and Ubaba. Siya and I play along just to keep you and Ubaba happy. [IN ZULU] But we don't know Phume. [IN ENGLISH] And we never did. [SOBS] I just wish we could move past this, Ma. Not celebrate her birthday anymore. Not blow out these candles and make a wish year after year and invite these people to our house. [EXHALES] I just wish... you would love Siya and I as much as you love Phume. That's not fair. I love you and Siya with everything I have. [SIGHS] Can I sleep now? [SNIFFS] [MAN] Come on, Puleng! [INDISTINCT VOICES] [BLOWS] [MOM] Puleng! [COACH] Puleng! Pick it up! - [MAN 2] You got this. - [GIRL] Run! Come on! Get the ball! Come on, girls! Come on! [CROWD CHEERING] [MUFFLED] Friend, are you okay? Are you okay? Okay, cool. Focus. [PHONES CHIMING] [GIRL, NORMAL] Run! What are you doing? Come on, man! Come on, Puleng! Come on! [GIRL] What is that? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [TENSE MUSIC PLAYS] [EXHALES] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Why are people staring? I had a bad game. Jeez, so what? Hey. Puleng, what's this about? - What? - Look. Well done, P. You fucked up that game, didn't you? Keep going like that, we'll end up at the bottom of the league. Jeez, let it go, Nate. I'll lay off once you stop screwing us out of the season. - [NATE] Bitch. - You know what? Maybe if you laid off the steroids a little, I might be able to see past your fat head next time. Know what? Maybe your dad should've sold you into slavery instead of your si... Fuck off, Nate! No one cares what you think. Fuck you. Who are you even? Friend, I really think you need to see this. - What are you on about? - [ZAMA] Puleng... Watch your mouth, you fucking Neanderthal. [GIRLS SCREAMING] Fuck you and your entire family! Don't talk about my fucking family! - Get this bitch off of me! - Puleng! [PULENG] Did you know about this? [ZAMA] Honestly, I didn't, friend. I only saw it after the match. It's all bullshit, though. None of this is true. [WOMAN] Julius Khumalo, the father of one of the abducted babies in the related Point of Grace Adoption Agency scandal is suspected to be part of the child laundering scheme where he is now suspected to have sold his baby girl just before she was born. Come on, let's go. [EXHALES] - Sir... - [MAN] You don't have to explain. I've seen the news, and I've contacted your parents. They will be collecting you soon. I'm sure you guys have a lot to talk about. Having said that, Miss Khumalo... the news about your dad is no excuse for what you did. In addition, your grades have spiraled, your averages is dropping, and the coach says you're not focused. I mean, and now you're getting into fights? But, sir, Nate started it. You physically attacked her. I want you to understand, only you can choose how you react to different situations in life. In other words, don't blame Nate for your reaction. Your reaction is on you. As a result, there'll be a disciplinary hearing in your honor on Wednesday. You can go now. Your parents will be here soon. And please, be on time. I'd hate to suspend you. Can someone explain what's going on? I don't understand. - Why are they bringing this up again? - [JULIUS] Calm down. There's nothing to understand. It's just this journalist who's trying to make a story out of nothing. Some evidence from another kidnapping case has made them look at Phume's case again. What did they find? [JULIUS] Not much yet, except my name popped up in some documentation that's causing them to think that I did some horrible thing. But the police will soon realize that they were very wrong. Why didn't you tell me? I thought I had time to prepare you guys. But these journalists, you know, they wanna sell newspapers so they fight for an exclusive. We wanted to protect you guys. No, you decided that. Listen to me. You need to trust me. Don't believe everything you see in the news about me. Soon there'll be lots of lies that they'll publish. And Phume's case? What happens to it? It might be reopened. We're not sure yet. [VIDEO GAME SOUNDS] Okay, wrap it up. You're not supposed to play with that thing before you sleep. But that's what makes you the best sister a boy could ask for, eh? You let me do things that our ma won't. Ha ha, very charming, but flattery will get you nowhere. Give it here. [EXHALES] [PHONE CHIMES] [PHONE CHIMES] [PHONE CHIMES] [EXHALES] [SCOFFS] Crazy. [EXHALES] What are you getting at, Puleng? [EXHALES] [EXHALES] [AMBIENT MUSIC PLAYING] [EXHALES] [MUSIC STOPS] [ZAMA] Mm. Hot, hot, hot. These pictures don't do Chris's body any justice, right? Friend? What's up? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. - Don't wanna talk about it. - Oh, friend, I'm actually freaking out. So, like, Chris invited me over to his place this weekend, right? Oh! Did I tell you what happened the other night when we went to his? Mm-mm, mm-mm. Zama... [SCOFFS] I saw it all. Thanks. [ZAMA] What are you looking at? Fiksation much? Look, if you're into furburgers and stuff, I fully support you. Zama, no, it's not like that. I just... Her life seems pretty perfect; That's it. I know, right? I totally love her life. I mean, her dad's a millionaire. Academic honors. And her blazer is just ridiculous. Yeah, and Chris cannot stop talking about her swimming skills. - Jealous? - [SCOFFS] Me? - Mm-hmm. - No, I'm not. She's pretty. Sports Illustrated SA wants to profile her. They say she might go to the Olympics. There has to be something wrong with this girl. Maybe she has 13 toes, and maybe that's her secret to swimming. - [BOTH LAUGH] - Shh! [BOTH GIGGLING] But you need to be more concerned about Chris. I mean, what's he hiding? He's perfect, nè? Oh, look at this... Look at this picture, friend. The genetics of the man. [ZAMA SUCKS TEETH] Genetics. And then? Zama, I have to go. [EXHALES] "Parental consent if minor." [CLICKS TONGUE] Shit. "Payment of 2,500." Steep, not impossible. "Results are not always guaranteed." [EXHALES] It's worth a try.

[PANTING] What'd I miss? [MUFFLED] Puleng's acting as if nothing is going on; Meanwhile, she's about to be expelled. [VOICE ECHOING] [NORMAL] I'm talking to you. Puleng, your mother is talking to you. What is wrong with you? Answer her. Uh... Sorry. What was your question? Where were you, Puleng? I forgot. I was in the library doing some work. Makhu, you forgot? I don't buy that. They sent someone to look for you all around the premises. And I tried calling you a million times. Well, they must've missed me. I'm sorry. Well, that won't cut it this time. You're grounded until your suspension is over. Give me your phone. - Pa. - Give me your phone. [DOOR SLAMS OPEN] The stubbornness of this child, I can't believe it. Thandeka... [IN ZULU] take Puleng to the car. [IN ENGLISH] Let me handle this. [PULENG] For how long? - Mr. Khumalo? I'm Captain Manah. - Puleng... - I'm arresting you for human trafficking. - [STUDENTS GASP] - You have the right to remain silent. - Human trafficking? [MANAH] Anything you say'll be held against you in a court of law. - Ma? - You have the right to an attorney... - [IN ZULU] What's going on? - [CAMERAS CLICKING] [IN ENGLISH] ...one will be provided to you by the state. - [THANDEKA] It's okay. - Do you understand your rights? - Why are they taking him? - Everything's gonna be fine. I do, but... - Baba. - Puleng, wait. - Baba! - Wait. My daughter. - Everything's going to be fine. - Mama, do something! [CAMERAS CONTINUE CLICKING] Baba! What are you doing? [CRYING] It's okay. Shh. [SOBBING] It's okay. - [SOBBING] - It's okay. [JULIUS IN ZULU] I'm sorry. [IN ENGLISH] For all this. I know it's a mess. I suggest that we keep Puleng and Siya as far away from this as possible. [JULIUS CLEARS THROAT] Your mother's right about this. We'll have to keep our distance for now. I don't want you and Siya to get mixed up in this. What's happening, Baba? I thought you said it was nothing. Puleng, I need you to trust me. This is very complicated. Complicated? Puleng... I think Ubaba's had enough for today. Let's let him sort this out. The lawyer will be here shortly. Maybe then things will make sense. - [THANDEKA] Let's go. - [DOOR OPENS] See you later. Ma? We can't just leave him in there. Well, we don't have a choice, my love. Wait. You don't actually think he did this? He asked us to trust him. Let's start with that. But for now, Puleng... until all of this is sorted, we have to keep our distance. [SIYA] So when does he come home? ["SMA" BY NASTY C PLAYING] Honestly... I don't know. We'll have to wait and see. So, we just wait and see if Ubaba ever comes home? What can we do to help him? Siya, the lawyers are on it, okay? They know what they're doing. Seriously... what about us? Can't we do something to help even more? [EXHALES] Okay... I might have a plan. [SIYA] Might?
