 - The Royal Woods House of Terror just opened for the season and we're finally old enough to go. Check it out: Zombies, vampires, mutants, all waiting to pounce on you the minute you step inside. - Dude, don't bother telling them about it. They'll never go. Everyone knows they're the biggest chickens in our class. - Oh, yeah? Then how come we already got tickets to it, Chandler? - We did? Oh, right, we did. I totally forgot because I'm so excited and not at all terrified. [whimpers] [loud thud] [both scream] - Oh, really? When are you going? - Uh, tomorrow night. - Cool, then we'll get our tickets for tomorrow night too. That way, we can all go together. [chuckles] - Great, looking forward to it. - I'll bet you are. - Oh, man, what did we just do? How are we gonna get through the House of Terror? - I won't even get up to pee at night if my Blarney night light isn't on. I better call Dr. Lopez. [phone line ringing] Oh, no, it went to voicemail. [breathing heavily] - Wait, I've got an idea. Maybe we can toughen ourselves up before tomorrow night so we'll be able to handle the House of Terror, and I know who can help us. - [exhales] - So what do you say? Are you up for scaring the daylights out of us? - Yeah! - I'm in. - Lucy, you're our resident scream queen. What do you suggest? - I've got a few ideas. [thunder crashes] [knocks on door] We're ready, Lincoln. - We can do this. - Totally. both: Clincoln McCloud. [both gasp] [teeth chattering] - Uh, it doesn't look so bad. Thanks for the encouraging pat, buddy. - You too. both: That's not me. all: Boo! [both scream] both: Ugh. - Whoops. - Whoopsie. [teeth chattering] - This is my fault. I gave you too much fright too soon. - [chattering] It's okay. - [chattering] You m-m-m-meant well. - We'll dial the scares back a little for round two. - Okay, Luce, we're ready to try again. - What have you got for us? - Actually, I just ordered you guys a pizza. [doorbell rings] Oh, and there it is. - Pizza? Not afraid of that. - Me neither. both: P-p-p-pizza! [both laugh] [chainsaw whirs] [both scream] - Oof. - Oh. [eyeballs rattle] - Oh, too much? [teeth chattering] - Sorry, I'll dial it back some more. You guys better now? Okay, let's try this again. - Lincoln, Clyde, I'm glad you're here. I have a bone to pick with you. Or should I say 206 bones? [evil laugh] [both scream] [both groan] - Sorry. Here's an easy one. All you have to do is go down in the basement. - We can definitely do this. Though it sure is dark down there. [stair creaks] [both scream] - Sorry. All you have to do is go in my room and open the coffin. - Brightly lit empty room? We got this one. It's empty. - Phew, that wasn't so bad. - I knew you could do it. [both scream] both: Whoa! - Sorry. Okay, even less scary. Got it. - [howls] [both scream] - Lily, wrong time to break out your new wolf jammies. [teeth chattering] - Sigh. - Hey, guys. - What's the word? - Hello. - Hi. - Uh, why are you wrapped in blankets? And, Lincoln, why are you holding Bun Bun? - Lucy's been trying to prep us to go to the House of Terror tonight. - We told some classmates we'd meet them there, and we don't wanna look like chickens. - Dudes, I worked at the House of Terror a few seasons ago. I used to haul people to the first aid tent when they passed out. - Passed out? - Yeah, I'd just throw 'em in the wheelbarrow. - Wheelbarrow? - Tell you what, why don't I call and see if any of my friends still work there? I'm sure they'd let us take a tour of the place with all the lights on. Maybe that would help make you less scared. both: That'd be awesome! [thunder crashes] [creepy music] - This place doesn't look so bad, Clyde. - Yeah, we got this. Why, hello there, Mr. Squirrel. High five, boop. - You guys ready for the tour? [both scream] - We got to stop doing that. [bird caws] - You can do this, little dudes. There's nothing to be afraid of. [shoes squeak] - Ah! both: Spider webs! - Check it, they're just string. both: Huh. [both scream] - They're just paper-mache. Styrofoam. Food coloring. Toilet paper. Yogurt with fruit mixed in. See, it's all special effects. - I guess you're right. [both scream] - That's not! - No, it's just Mrs. Bernardo, my old drama teacher. Hey, Mrs. B. - Bobby, what a nice surprise. What brings you back to Royal Woods? - Just giving my friends a tour. - Hello. both: Hello. - Tell your mom we miss her at bingo. - Will do. - [snarling] [both scream] - Relax. That's just Mr. Wisniewski, the crossing guard. He likes jobs where he can be on his feet. - [blows whistle] - Oh, thank you, sir. - And, finally, this is what we in the haunted house biz call a bail out door. - Ooh. - Things get too scary tonight, you can just run outside here. - Thanks, Bobby, but I don't think we'll need it. - Yeah, this place is just special effects and friendly town folk. It's not scary at all. - You really saved our butts, Bobby. Can we treat you to a thank-you Flippee? - Oh, you bet. But before we leave, I want to go say hi to the flesh-eating mutant. He's my old T-ball coach. [thunder crashes] - We've totally got this, Clyde. - Totally. - Aw, an encouraging squirrel high five. Boop. [bird caws] - Miss Bernardo? - Aren't you supposed to be inside getting ready to scare people? - Not anymore. Management just let the entire staff go. - What? Why? - Word got back to them that you kids took a tour today and didn't find the place very scary. both: Oh. [chuckles] Ugh. - So they decided to do a complete overhaul. Apparently it's 100 times scarier now. - It's scarier and we got everyone fired? This is a double bagger. [breathing heavily] - [laughs] Don't worry about me, honey. This gives me more time to work on my ♪ one woman show - What are we gonna do? We'll never get through this. - Maybe we can get out of here before Chandler shows up. - What up, chumps? - Dang it. - You guys actually made it. I didn't think you would. [door creaks] After you. [both gulp] - Sure is dark in here. - [cackles] [both screaming] - [screams] - We'll go this way. You chumps go that way. See you chickens at the exit. - [screams] - [screams] [both scream] - [growls] [both scream] [both breathing heavily] - Brains. [both screaming] - We gotta find that bail out door. - My thoughts exactly. [all screaming] - That was the scariest experience of my life. - I need a hug. - Well, who's gonna hug me? - Bring it in, dude. [both screaming] [both breathing heavily] - Oh, man, the bail out door was much farther than I thought. - They really need to work on their signage. - Hey, guys, how'd you get out before us? - Oh, well, uh... - We took the bail out door. That place was way too scary. Ow. - Guess you guys made it all the way through. [both scream] - Yeah, I guess we did. - Are you gonna rat us out to everyone at school for being chickens? - No, that wouldn't be cool. - Oh, you guys are all right. I'm sorry for always messing with you. - Forget it. - Yeah, we're good. - Hey, you guys want to go to Gus' for some pizza? - Sure. - Sounds great. - Wow, friends with Chandler. Who would have thunk it? - Do you think we should tell him we only made it to the end because we couldn't find the bail out door? both: Nah. - That'll be our little secret. Aw, he's wearing a crow costume. - Are you trying to scare us too? You cute little-- [both scream] [dramatic music] ♪ - [gasps] [screams] - Lucy, I need you to show me how to do that cat eye again. I'm trying a "night on the town" look. - Give me one second. - [gasps] I didn't know you had a doll. She--she's breathtaking. Where did you get her? - I found her in one of Great-Grandma Harriet's trunks in the attic. - Well, you absolutely must allow me to throw her a "welcome to the family" tea party. - Oh, sorry, Lola, but no. She's really fragile. I have to take special care of her. I spent all day making this coffin to keep her safe. - A doll this beautiful deserves to be played with, not left in a creepy coffin. I can keep her safe, I swear. - It's not that I don't trust you, but I know things can get a little crazy in your room. - [scoffs] That is not true. - Yeah! Reel it in, you guys! [loud crash] Sorry, Lise. Sorry, Lols. Broke another teacup. Actually, make that the whole set. - Sorry, Lola. The answer is no. - [groans] I have to find a way to play with that doll. - Ahem, Lucy, may I present to you "Reasons Lola Loud Should be Trusted with Lucy's Doll." - Save your breath. Lucy's not here. She's at a poetry convention all day. Oh, that means there's an extra breakfast downstairs. Dibs on Lucy's bacon! - Gone all day? Hmm. You're even more beautiful than I remembered. Oh, and you look so bored in there, no one to gossip with over Earl Grey and crumpets. You know, we could have a really great tea party and I could get you back into this coffin before Lucy's home. Mr. Sprinkles, Eunice, you two, please welcome-- oh, we need a name for you. How about Lady Rosalind Cordelia Annabella Pembrookington, or Rosie for short. Tea? [humming] I'll make it extra sweet for you. [gasps] Oh, no. Oh, no, Lucy's gonna kill me. Maybe it's not that noticeable? Gaa, of course it is! [breathing heavily] Don't panic. You can fix this. [bell dings] I know! Come on, Mr. Sprinkles. I need emotional support. No offense, Eunice. You're a delight, but I just don't think we have that kind of relationship. Rosie, you just sit there and chat with Mr. Sprinkles while I wash your dress. [gasps] [screams] It soaked through! [groans] Well, I suppose your body can go in the wash but your delicate porcelain head can't. So I'll just... [groaning] [gasps] - Oh, Rosie, I'm so sorry. Mr. Sprinkles, what do I do? Hmm. There we go. That should hold. I don't know, what do you guys think? Ugh, I know it looks bad, Eunice, but as my friend, you aren't supposed to say that. I'm sorry. I'm having a day. Maybe I can just cover the crack with her hair? [gasps] Ah, could this possibly get any worse? [screams] How did this happen? Great, the one day of the year Lana washes her hat. [glass breaking] Well, this is beyond fixing so... [laughs] Hmm. I need a ride to the antique district now, no questions asked. - Wait, do you need to go tinkle before we leave? - What did I just say? But yes. Circle the block. [tires squeal] What do you think, Mr. Sprinkles? If I change the eyeliner, curl the hair, and file down the teeth, she just might pass for the original. I'll take her. And all of those. [thunder crashes] That should do it. [gasps] Lincoln, hello. Lovely weather we're having. - Uh, yeah, I guess. Hey, have you seen my glue? - Pfft, why would I have? What do you think, I go around swiping people's glue? - You don't have to get mad about it. - I'm not mad! You were once so beautiful, but now I have to get rid of you. Sorry, Rosie, but if Lucy finds you, I'm toast. Here, in case you get thirsty. [birds tweeting] Ah. Good morning, sweet princes and princesses. [gasps] [screams] Rosie, how did you get back up here? I put you in the crawl space. Maybe I just dreamed it. Yeah, it was probably that cheese I ate right before bed. Always gives me nightmares. [dog whines] You saw nothing. [dog whimpers] I know, and it's like just because you have a beautiful mane does not make you the fashion police, am I right? I'm right. [screams] What are you doing here? I buried you, and that was not a cheese dream. [gasps] You're haunted. [thunder crashes] [shudders] Of course you are. You belong to Lucy. Well, my little friend, you picked the wrong person to haunt. Sayonara, spooky. Good luck getting back from the dump. - Hey, Lols, how's it going? - Ugh, Lincoln, what's with the third degree? It's none of your business how it's going. - Why are you so mad? - I'm not mad! [screams] Seriously? Okay, that's it. I am taking care of this creepy doll once and for all! - Hey, Lols, where are you off to? - Ugh, why are you everywhere? Shouldn't you be playing with Clyde or something? - Clyde's at his weekly therapy appointment. He invited me, but... [tires squeal] - Ahh. - Flip, you old scoundrel, you still got that boat? - Well, depends who's asking. You with the taxman? - No, I'm six. - Ah, then yep. What can I do you for? - I need a ride to Tall Timbers Pond, midnight, on the side where the dock lights are burned out. - Ah, it's one of those kinds of trips. Well, I can do it, but it's gonna cost you. - Money's no object, Flip. I've lost a lot of baby teeth lately. - [groaning] How much farther? You know, I charge by the nautical mile. - This is fine right here. So long, sister. What are you lookin' at? - Nothing. Ah, I don't want any trouble. - Keep your yap shut and you won't get any. Now row. [bird caws] Hmm? [gasps] [thunder crashes] [gasps] [screams] [breathing heavily] Lucy! - Hey, Lola. Glad you're here. I just drew the ace of wands, which means you're going-- - Never mind that. We need to barricade the door. Help me move this dresser. - Uh, want to tell me what's going on? - [sighs] Okay. I took your creepy doll and then I broke her and now she's haunting me. I'm so sorry, Lucy. You told me not to touch her, and I should have listened to you. - You broke her? She looks fine to me. - Uh, that--yeah, that's not your doll. That is! [thunder crashes] - Whoa, how did you even do this? - Well, it began as a simple tea stain, and then things kind of progressed from there. [sighs] I'm a terrible sister. - No, you're not. I forgive you. It's not like you did this on purpose. - Thank you, Luce. You're really nice. So can you please get her to stop haunting me and stuff? - She was probably just haunting you because you took her away from her rightful owner. Now that you've given her back, I'm sure she'll leave you alone. - Phew. Well, that's a relief. And sorry again for wrecking your doll and stuff. - Wrecking her? Now that I know she can haunt people, I like her even better. - Of course she does. [mouse squeaks] [frog croaks] - Whoa, guys, wrong way! [frog croaks] Sorry, Lynn. I'm still training 'em. - No big. They probably smell the sandwich I left down there. [mouse squeaks] Whoop, looks like Lola's doll got out of our room again. - That's not Lola's. That's Lucy's. - It is? Oh, well, I feel like a dummy, 'cause I kept finding it in all these weird places and returning it to our room. First it was in the crawl space, then buried in the backyard, then at the dump. I even found it at the bottom of Tall Timbers Pond when I was visiting my fish friends. - Weird, how'd it get to all those places? - I don't know, Lynn. How do boogers get made? Some stuff is just unexplainable. - Yeah, true that. - Hey, you guys better share!
