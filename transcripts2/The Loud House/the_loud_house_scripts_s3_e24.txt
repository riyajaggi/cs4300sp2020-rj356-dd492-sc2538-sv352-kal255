 I don't know what I'm gonna do next year after you graduate. You have been the heart and soul of this team for four years. - [laughs softly] Thanks, Coach Hutch. - Speaking of next year, you still got your eyes on Fairway University? - Yes. It's literally my dream. I'm just not sure I have the grades to get in. - Well, I think you have the golf skills to get in. As a matter of fact, I've invited Coach Niblick from Fairway to come watch your next game. - [honks] - [laughs] I'll take that as a thumbs up. - Fairway University boasts a tradition of academic excellence, and a golf program as old as our great nation. At Fairway, we live and breathe golf 24/7. - And the cubed root of 64 is... - Four! [all gasp] - [sighs] Doesn't it look amazing? You know what the best part is? It's only a few miles outside the city, so I'll be close to Bobby. - Well, this calls for a celebration. I'll make a cake--no, wait. Par-faits. [laughs] Get it? - Good one, Dad, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. The coach is coming to watch my next game. If he offers me a spot, then we can celebrate. Can you imagine? My life is literally going to be perfect. First, I'll graduate from Fairway, then Bobby and I will get married, and he'll take care of our kids, all 11 of them, while I travel the world on the professional golf tour. [rousing music] crowd: [chanting] Lori! Lori! - Lori? Lori? - Huh? What? - Lori, I was just thinking. How about I be your caddy for the big tournament? - Aww, that's so nice of you, Lincoln. What's the catch? - No catch. I wanna learn to caddy. Rusty did it last summer and made a ton of money in tips. So, what do you say? - Sure, why not? Just be careful with the clubs. They used to be Pop Pop's. [crash] - [sheepish laugh] Oops. [grunting] - Okay, let's get this practice under way. Lori, you're up. - [grunts] - Lincoln, my driver, please. - I thought I was your caddy. - No, I mean the club called the driver. - Ah. - That's a putter. - You didn't tell me it was hiding. [crowd gasps] Take a mulligan. Try again. We'll call that a warm-up shot. - [yelps] [crowd gasps] [ball thunks] [man groans] - What is up with my game today? - Aww, don't worry about it, champ. Just keep a cool head. [upbeat music] ♪ - [inhales] [chomping sound] [screams] ♪ - [screams] - [screams] - [grunting] [angry grunting] [sighs heavily] [groans] Nice going, Lori. - Uh, everything okay, Lori? - No, it's literally terrible! My whole future is riding on this huge tournament tomorrow, and my game is falling apart! There's too much pressure! [hyperventilates] - I can help! - I can help! - [sniffs] Really? - Yeah, I'm used to dealing with pressure in sports. - Same with me and pageants. - And me with gigs. - Wow. That would be awesome, you guys. - Sweet. Let's hit the golf course right now. - [sighs] We can't. It's closed. - [loudly] I've got an idea! - Lincoln, you're shouting! - Ah, that's better. - [inhales, exhales] [club thonks] [man groans] See? I can't even hold the club. My hands are too sweaty. - I know that life. I remember the end of my last hoops tournament. It was a tied game with one second to go, and it was all up to me. The sweat was flowing like Niagara. Fortunately, I had my secret weapon. Talcum powder keeps your palms cool and dry. [epic music] [crowd cheering] I made the shot. We won the championship. I was a hero. - Wow, that really helped. Thanks, Lynn. Too bad it doesn't do anything for my shakes. - I got this one. Used to be, whenever I took the stage... [crowd clapping] There was a whole lot of shaking going on, but I got it under control with a mantra. Don't fret. Just play your set. [applause] [heavenly harp music] ♪ Whoo! [cheers and applause] [crowd gasps] - How about, "Don't overthink it. Relax and sink it." [inhales] Don't overthink it. Relax and sink it... [gasps] It's working. No more shakes! [heartbeat thudding] Now I just need to stop my heart from beating like crazy. - I can relate. There I was, about to perform at the Little Miss Cheese Curd Pageant. My heart was going a mile a minute, but I was able to calm myself down by using 4-7-8 breathing. Breathe in for four seconds, hold it in for seven, then breathe out for eight. [crowd cheering] - Cheese! Cheese! - Yes! - [inhales, exhales] Wow, that does help. You guys are the best. - Now, let's see you put it all together. - [inhales, exhales] Don't overthink it. Relax and sink it. [rousing music] - Whoo-hoo, Lori! - Yeah! - You did it! - Good job, Lori! [all chattering excitedly] I'll get the ball. Whoa--help! [crowd cheering] - This is Coach Niblick from Fairway University. - Uh... [honks] - I think that means she's excited to meet you. - Right back at you, Lori. Say, here's a little something from Fairway. Look forward to seeing you play today. This could be the start of a bright future. Future, future, future... - Babe, you still wearing that old visor? I thought it brought back bad memories. - [screams] Who are you? - [chuckles] Very funny, babe. We've only been married 28 years, I'll never forget the day we met-- right after you blew that golf tournament, didn't get into Fairway and broke up with that guy. What was his name? Bee-bop-bear? Ah! [whimpers] - Uh, Lori? You okay? - Oh, yeah. I'm fine. - Ooh, I got that. - [gasps] [heartbeat thudding] Stay focused. You can do this. Talcum powder. More. More! [coughs] Don't overthink it. Relax and sink it. Don't overthink it. Relax and sink it! Don't overthink it! Relax and sink it! It's not doing anything. - Breathe. - Right. Right. 2-3-4 breathing. [inhales, exhales] [inhales] Ugh, it's not working. Wait, was it 7-8-9? [inhales] [panting] Oh. [whimpering] - Eh, she'll be okay. Just a few jitters. [chuckles] You can do this, Lori! [uneasy music] [whimpers] - Come on, Lori! - Send it for a ride, Lori! ♪ [all yelp] [woman yelps] [cow moos] [car alarm trips] - Oww! [crash] [somber piano music] - [sobbing] - Aww, come on, Lori. It's not all bad. At least, uh, we're getting a nice walk in. - [bawls] - Sweetie, what's going on? - If I blow this match, my whole future is shot, so of course, now I'm blowing it! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't be so hard on yourself, honey. Look, life doesn't work like that. You get plenty of chances. - Yeah. And if you don't get into Fairway, something else will work out. You're a terrific person, and you're gonna have a terrific life. - [sighs] Do you really think so? [sniffs] Thanks, you guys. Lincoln, my 9 iron, please. I've got a tournament to finish. - You know what? I think a pitching wedge might be better for this hole. - Hey, you're getting good at this. - [yelps, grunts] [drum roll] - [inhales, exhales] [upbeat music] ♪ Yes! ♪ [crowd cheers] Yes! [crowd cheers] [disappointed sigh] - That was an amazing comeback. - Thanks, Mom. Too bad Coach Niblick didn't see it. But you guys were right. I'll be okay, even if I don't go to Fairway. - Who says you're not going to Fairway? - Coach Niblick? I thought you left because I was such a disaster. - Well, I was going to leave, but you broke my windshield. [truck beeping] But I'm glad I stayed. Lori, you're a great golfer who doesn't give up, just like George Washington! I am officially offering you a spot on Fairway's golf team. - [honks] - That means she'll take it. - And Mr. and Mrs. Loud, I'm officially offering you the bill for my windshield.
