 - Hey there! I'm Michelle.
- And I'm Doug.
 - And we're the producers
of "America's Next Hitmaker"!
 - Here's how it works.
 Submit your original song,
 and if you make the top five,
 you'll get to perform
before millions on live TV!
 - And if your song
gets the most viewer votes,
 you get a record deal.
 - So upload
your submission now,
 'cause maybe
you've got the song
 the whole world will love!
 - You know I do!
 Wait.
The whole world?
 I mean, I love my song,
but will everybody?
 Maybe I better think
about this.

- What song?
 - The one
you were just singing!
 - I don't know
what you're talking about.
 I wasn't singing.
 But this baby will be,
 once I've replaced
her trip lever.

 - Uh, Lis?
What were you just doing?
 - Uh, working, per uzh.
 - So you weren't just rapping?
 Get it together, dude!
You're wigging out!
 - Do I detect
some psychological distress?
 I've been known to dabble
in the soft sciences.
 Take a seat.
 - So I was about to hit send,
but then I wondered,
 is this the song
the whole world will love?
 And that's when
I started hearing things.
 Lola singing a show tune,
 Lana doing her toilet jam.
 - And me, spitting sick rhymes
about the periodic table.
 It's clear
these aural hallucinations
 are projections
of your inner uncertainty.
 Your subconscious
is flipping between stations,
 trying to find the right sound
for your song.
 - Dude!
That makes total sense!
 So what is the right sound?
 [smooth music]
 ♪
 - ♪ Is it a crush?
 ♪ Or maybe it's chemistry
 ♪ Maybe it's all in my head
 Lori, look at this thread!

of song people want to hear,
 something deep and soulful.

 - Well, it can't be that one.
 [gloomy music]
 ♪
 - The universe is empty.
 And there's nothing
to be sure of but darkness.
 There's no music in the void,
 so why bother anyway?
 Embrace the emptiness.
Own the futility.
 The only song worth singing
is silence.
 - Heavy, man.
 Maybe that's what people
will dig.
 Something dark and somber.
 - Lynn-sanity in da house!
 [techno music]
 ♪ Get pumped! What!
Get ready! Huh! ♪
 ♪ This beat's about to get
heavy, oh, yeah ♪

 All right! Up top!
 - Look what you did to Edwin,
 you monster.
 - What? You wanna go?
 [grunting, blows falling]
 - Okay, so maybe
people want a song
 that gets the blood pumping.
 Oh, I don't know.
 The more I hear,
the more confused I get!

in harmony ♪

 - ♪ I'll be out of time
 - ♪ Don't have much to lose
 - ♪ But we'll be fine
 both: ♪ We're gonna keep
singing loud and wrong ♪
 ♪ 'Cause that's our kind
of song ♪
 - Huh. Maybe a country song
is the answer.
 [electronic music]
 But of course,
 here comes another one.

 - [sighs]
Or...
 maybe that's the ticket,
something people can dance to.
 Unless
I should go with a slow jam,
 o-or show tunes...
 o-or maybe rap.
 No, country!

 Fingers crossed, Mick!
 Maybe someday
I'll be opening for you.
 [screams]
 I'm in, I'm in, I'm in!
 - In what, in what, in what?
 - "America's Next Hitmaker"!
 I just got an email saying my
song made it to the top five!
 [all cheering]
 - We knew you could do it!
 - Is it the song
you've been playing
 for the last couple of days?
 [together]
♪ Play it loud, play it loud
 ♪ I got no time
for turning it down ♪
 - Actually,
I submitted a different one.
 I really want to win
this contest,
 so I needed a song
the whole world would dig.
 - Well, looks like
you nailed it!
 - [grunts]
- Way to dominate!
 - Thanks, dude.
 But watch the diaphragm.
 I still got to sing.
 Whoa!
 Rad!
 - [clears throat]
- Excuse me.
 I think you might be
in the wrong theater.
 The auditions for "So You Think
You Can Head Bang"
 are down the street.
 - No, dudes. I'm here
for "America's Next Hitmaker."
 I'm Luna Loud,
one of the finalists.
 ♪ All we know is
la la la la la ♪
 - Ooh! Love it!
 But you're not exactly
what we expected.
 - Yeah, your look
is interesting,
 but it doesn't really fit
with your song.
 - Oh, I-I was just trying
to write something
 the whole world would love.
 - Great attitude.
That's what this is all about.
 - So now that you've got
the song covered,
 let's make you into a girl
the whole world will love.
 - Uh...
- Nothing crazy.
 Just a couple little tweaks.
 Sometimes in the music biz,
 you got to play the game
to get the fame.
 - You do want the fame,
don't you?
 - Well, sure.
- Then trust us!

 - Hey, Lola.
- Dude. It's me, Luna.
 [all gasp]
 - Learn to take a compliment,
sweetie.
 - Luna, what happened to you?
- Nothing.
 The producers
just made a few tweaks.
 [sneezes]
- A few tweaks?
 You are literally
unrecognizable.
 - [scoffs]
Give me a break, dude.
 - Oh, hi.
Rita Loud.
 You must be
one of Lori's friends.
 - Mom! It's Luna!
 [both gasp]
- Chill, guys!
 Sometimes
in the music industry,
 you got to play the game
to get the fame.
 They just don't get it,
Mick.
 - Don't worry, love.
I do.
 This is a tough business.
 Only one in a million makes it.
 You got to do
what you got to do.
 Besides, it's not like
you're selling your soul.
 - Right?
That's what I'm saying!
 - You're still you.
You're still Luna Loud.
 - Sorry,
you're no longer Luna Loud.
 - Excuse me, brah?
 - We did some pre-show testing,
 and the name Luna Loud
 just doesn't say
"girl the whole world loves."
 - But your new one does!
 - Lulu?
 - Yep! Just Lulu!
 Isn't it fabulous?
 - This doesn't even
have strings!
 How am I supposed to play it?
 - Oh, honey,
you don't need to play!
 Or sing.
You just have to lip-synch.
 - Almost showtime!
Break a leg, Lulu!
 - What?

 - Focus groups loved
the glitter cannons.
 - Um, Doug, Michelle,
 I've been doing some thinking.
 What if we made
a few more tweaks?
 - What do you have in mind?
 - Well, how about if I actually
perform the song?
 And I do it
in my regular clothes.
 And I keep my name.
 - Sweetie, those are a bit more
than tweaks.
 - I know, but--
- Let me break it down for you.
 You go on as Lulu,
or you don't go on at all.
 Are we clear?
 - [sighs]

from Royal Woods, Michigan.

 I've been calling her Luna
all these years!
 - Sorry,
I've made a huge mistake.
 This isn't me.
I'm not Lulu.
 I am Luna Loud!
