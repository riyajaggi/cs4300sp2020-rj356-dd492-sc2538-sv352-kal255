Well, so does my teacher. Our class assignment is to do a report on our families. With ten sisters, I can sum up mine in one word. Chaos. It took 3 weeks, 4 boxes of pasta, 2 tubes of glue, and 27 popsicle sticks,

 but the centerpiece of my project is finally finished. Pretty accurate representation of the Loud family, I'd say, but making this thing was the easy part. The real challenge is getting it to school on time and in one piece to give my report. Sounds easy, right? Not in my house. If you want to get all ten of your sisters out the door on time, you have to get up pretty early, and you have to have a plan. [loud thuds and indistinct chatter] The ten-headed beast has awoken. Wish me luck. [cat yowls] Ah! Not today, Luan. - Oh, we'll see about that. "Pailure" is not an option. [laughs] Get it? - I'll just take this to the car later, but first, Luna. A little "Man with the Plan" music? - You got it, man. [plays rock music] - It's my dollar! - No, it's mine! - Let go! - No, you let go. - Right on cue. - You let go! - Stop it! both: Hey! [cash register bell rings] - Half for Lola. Half for Lana. both: Thanks, Lincoln. - Good morning, Lincoln. - Ah! Good morning, Lucy. - For my new poem, I need a word that rhymes with choose. - Uh, how about lose? - That works. - Time to get dressed, Lily. - Hey, Lincoln! Think fast! [Lily giggles] - [chuckles] Nice catch, Lincoln. - Nice throw, Lynn. [Lily babbles] - O-M-G, Bobby, I literally had to call you right away. I am just so excited about the homecoming dance. I know, right? You're so sweet. - I'll get the drop on you yet. [laughs] Get it? - What do you want? - Lori, could you maybe hang up the phone and get ready for school? - Cool it, twerp. I'm quite capable of doing two things at once. - [gasps] - Leni? - Note to self. Never walk and chew gum at the same time. - Time's running out. - Lincoln, think fast! ♪ - Okay, let's get you downstairs. - Scatter, she's gonna blow! - Or not. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! [Erlenmeyer flask whistles] [whistling stops] Phew! Lisa, you're always forgetting the dinitrotoluene. - Silly me. Much appreciated. [explosion booms] I'm still alive! - Ayeee! Lucha libre! [screams] [clatter and cat yowls] Todo bien. - Lily, pants. [hamster chitters] [Lily babbles] - I was here first! - No, I was! - Nuh-uh! I was! - No way! I was! - You always say that! - You do! both: Hey, no cutting! Thanks, Lincoln. ♪ - Has anyone seen my zit cream? - I literally found the cutest dress to wear. - A word that rhymes with stuck. - Luck. - How do you stop a rhino from charging? - You take away his credit card. - [laughs] - Mom said no solving for X on the walls. Same. Blame. Game. Fame. - Where the heck are my roller skates? I've got field hockey today. - Wait. There's no roller skates in field hockey. - The way I play, there is. [Lily babbles] - Gotcha. Phase one of Operation Get Ready for School and Into the Car on Time is complete. Now comes phase two, breakfast. ♪ - Thank you! [sizzles] - Cooking is usually Dad's territory, but I gave him the day off 'cause I have to kick things into high gear. Egg whites for Leni. Sunny side up for Luna. Funny side up for Luan. - Great yolk. [laughs] - Scrambled for Lynn. Fried for Lisa. Deviled eggs for the twins, and... - Oh, and I picked out the perfect tux for you to wear, Bobby. - Hard-boiled for Lori. Extra goo-goo-gooey for Lily. - Goo goo goo. - And for Lucy, extra well-done. - If I had a heart, it would be swelling right now. - All righty, then. We are dressed and fed, and now we have our backpacks and lunches prepared to dietary needs. We're just waiting on Lori. - No, not puke, Bobby. Puce. It's like a reddish brownish. - [groans] Everyone, wait here while I grab my project. Time for phase three, getting you out the door in one piece. Whoa! Whoa! [grunting] Whoa! Phew! Okay then, we're all ready to go? Time for phase four, out the door. Like I said, if you want to get all your sisters out the door on time, you have to have a plan. - Fine. If you don't want to wear the tux, then I don't want to go to the dance! In fact, I don't even want to go to school! [screams] - So close. Wait! [indistinct chatter] No, no, no. Everyone, stay right where you are. Lori, wait. You're the only one who can drive us. - Get Mom to drive you! - But she's already left. - Ah! I'm blue! My skin's turned blue! - Technically it's a sallow shade of cerulean, but why split hairs? - Lisa, what did you do? - I secretly switched Leni's blemish cream for an experimental skin pigmentation ointment I've been working on. - Why would you do that? - Because she wouldn't let me try it on her if I had asked. - You go upstairs right now and get something to fix it. - Fine. Hairless apes one, science zero. - Can't something go my way for once? - You can't always get what you want, bro. - Lincoln, I've finished my poem. It's called "Failure." - Lucy, I really don't have time for-- - Failure. It is not an option, yet it's something you choose. The man with the plan is destined to lose. - Lily, where are your clothes? And where is your diaper? - Go poo-poo. [laughs] [diaper squishes] - I found the diaper. [upbeat music] - Failure. You know there is no one else to blame, for the choices you make are always the same. - Come on, Lori. Please? I have my report this morning. - Go away! - The peanut butter sandwich is mine! - No, the jelly sandwich is yours! - No! - Ugh! - You like the peanut butter and I like the jelly! - You like peanut butter and I like jelly! - No, I like jelly and you-- both: Hey! ♪ - Now you each have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Now, get to the car. both: Thanks, Lincoln. - Here's the antidote. - Thank you. Wait a second. [bird chirps] The real antidote? - Fine. Hairless apes two, science zero. - Here. - [gasps] - Failure. It's all your fault, this streak of bad luck. No escape from this cycle in which you are stuck. - Stop! I've got a poem for you now. It's called "Lucy." Dark as night, hair like tar. Take your spooky self to the car. - Sigh. Once again, your poetic brilliance has put me to shame. - Think fast! - Oh! Ow. - Where is my field hockey stick? I have roller derby today. - There's no field hockey sticks in roller derby. - The way I play, there is! Oh! - Finally. I look perfect and beautiful again. - Oh, come on. I thought we were pails. [laughs] Get it? Get it? - How am I gonna deal with Lori? Got it. [phone line trilling] - Hello? - Hey, babe. It's your boyfriend, Bobby. I just wanted to say that I'm sorry and that I will wear any tux you want. - [squeals] Oh, Bobby! [laughs] ♪ Would you hurry up, Lincoln? It's always such a hassle getting you out of the door in the morning. ♪ - What's all this? - It's my gear, dude. I have rehearsal. - And who is that? - This is my roadie, Chunk. - No, no, no. He was not part of the plan. You, out. I'll take care of this. - Thanks, bro. - [grunts] [grunts] [dramatic music] Operation complete, and with ten minutes to spare. A Loud house first, I might add. Let's roll. [engine turns] [Luan laughs] Stop! [tires screech] ♪ [sighs] Phew! That was close. Aah! [grunts] [in slow-motion] No! [thud and clatter] All of this work for nothing. How could I be so stupid? How? How? How? - If you're done with your pity party, maybe we could help? - Yeah. 11 heads are better than 1. - Try not to lose yours. [laughs] - Yeah, every little thing is gonna be all right. - Really? You'll help? both: It's what families do. - But I'm supposed to give this report in ten minutes and this thing is destroyed. What can you guys do? In conclusion, in my family, every day is a challenge, but you can be sure that when I need them, my sisters will always be there for me. All of them. And sure, life in the Loud house can be summed up in one word. Chaos. But I love that chaos, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. - That was a fantastic report, Lincoln. I'm giving you an A. Ah! - [gasps] - Make that an A-minus. - Pailed it! [laughs]
