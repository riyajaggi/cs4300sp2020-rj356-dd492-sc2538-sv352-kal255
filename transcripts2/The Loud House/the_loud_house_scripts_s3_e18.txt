- Hmm.
 These totes bring out
your nose.
 Here, don't want you
getting cold.
 - Hey, Leni.
- Who told you my name?
 Oh, I'm wearing a nametag.
 - Shift's over.
 Let's go get pretzels.
 - Oh, it's you guys.
- Nice window dressing.
 You made the 'kins
look like friends.
 - Thanks.
I modeled them after us.
 [ding]
 [all munching]
 That's him, right?
Burger guy?
 - Yeah.
I'm so nervous about tonight.
 I haven't been on a date
since things fizzled
 with smoothie guy.
 [mournful music]
 - We'll come over after work
and help you get ready.
 Right, Miguel?
- Oh, I am yours, girl.
 - [gasps]
Hey, Leni.
 [girls squeal]
 [all kissing]
 - What a fun surprise.
 These are my two best friends
at school,
 Jackie and Mandee,
and these are
 my two best friends at work,
Miguel and Fiona.
 girls: Hey.
- Oh, hi.
 - Leni, we bought
so many cute shoes.
 - With money to spare
for the pop-up sale
 this weekend.
- Yes!
 Pop-up sale!
[screams]
 - Sounds like you guys
have a lot to talk about.
 I should mosey.
- Yeah, me, too.
 But we'll see you tonight,
Leni.
 - See you at 7:00!
 [mournful music]
 - Wait, you're hanging out
with those guys tonight?
 - Well, yeah.
 Is that bad?
- It's fine.
 I mean, I can't remember
the last time we spent
 a Friday night together,
but it's fine.
 - No, no, it's not fine.
 If I'm not making enough time
for you guys,
 I need to fix that.
 I'll come over after I'm done
at Fiona's house, okay?
 - Sounds good.
- See you laters.
 [mellow music]
 - I hate first dates.
 What--what if we have nothing
to talk about?
 - Don't worry,
you can use this list
 of 25 first-date questions
I found.
 [phone vibrating]
 Oh, what time are you leaving
for your date, Fiona?
 I should let Jackie
and Mandee know
 when to expect me.
- Wait, you double-booked us?
 - No, I just made
two separate plans
 for the same night.
- I mean, that's legit
 what a double-book is,
but it's fine.
 - Yeah, go be with
your school friends.
 We have this covered.
 - But I'll see you guys
at the pop-up sale
 this weekend?
 - I mean, sure.
- Yeah, I guess.
 ♪
 - Hey, guys!
I'm so glad we can hang out.
 Tell me what's new with you.
- Oh, my gosh, so much.
 I'm not sure I want to be
a veterinarian anymore.
 - I'm thinking about
getting bangs.
 [phone vibrating]
 - Wow, that is big.
 Speaking of bangs,
I should go check mine.
 Make sure they're not too flat.
 BRB.
 [sneaky music]
 Sorry, really gotta
get in there.
 Fiona, what's the matter?
- Sorry to bother you guys,
 but I need help.
 We already got through
those 25 questions.
 His answer to every one was...
 [deep voice]
I guess.
 - There have to be other things
you can talk about.
 I know, tell him about the time
 you went to Canada.
 Guys love adventure!
 - Are you okay?
 I thought I heard you
talking to someone.
 - Oh, yeah, I was just
talking to...
 myself.
 It helps me pee.

 Uh, but it didn't work.
I should go again.
 This time I'll try singing.

 - Leni, guess who's seated
at the table next to mine?
 Smoothie guy!
 And he looks so cute
and sensitive.
 - Move to another table
immediately.

 It didn't work
with smoothie guy, remember?
 Don't get sucked back

and now burger guy
 is going over there
to confront him?
 [phone vibrating]
 Whoops, this isn't the kitchen.
 [dramatic music]
 - [groans]
 [whining]
- What?
 Now burger guy and smoothie guy
are hanging out
 without you?
- Leni?
 Are you in here again?
 My brother really needs to pee.
 - Sorry, I'll--
I'll be right out!
 Just washing my hands.
 I'm really sorry, guys,
I have to go.
 - Oh, I guess
your other friends
 are more important
than my life.
 - Fiona, it's not like that.
 - O-M-gosh, are you talking
 to your work friends right now?
 - [shrill scream]
 - Leni, are you okay?
 [faucet squeaks]
 - [yelps]
I'm so sorry!
 I--I'll clean it up.
- Don't bother.
 Mandee will help me.
 We won't take up
any more of your time.
 - Yeah, neither will we.
 [dial tone]
 [downtrodden music]
 [door opens]
 - [sighing repeatedly]
 - [scoffs]
Leni, your sighing
 is literally ruining
my texting.
 What's wrong?
- I don't know what to do.
 I feel torn between two groups
of friends.
 How do I make them both happy?
- [clears throat]
 - [scoffs]
Lincoln, what do you want?
 - I think I know how
to help Leni.
 When I started hanging out
with Rusty and Zach
 Clyde and Liam felt left out,
 so I invited everyone
to hang out together
 and now we're all BFFs.
 - So, you're saying my friends
should hang out
 with your friends?
- No.
 Bring your friends together.
 - Huh.
That is surprisingly
 mature advice
for an 11-year-old.
 - Thank you.
Now, if you'll excuse me,
 I have to go write my name
on my new Ace Savvy underwear.
 [underwear stretches, snaps]
 - I literally take that back.
 [bouncy music]
 - We're gonna have
so much fun tonight.
 I planned a bunch of stuff
for us to do.
 - Yogurt-covered pretzels?
 [gasps]
And "16 1/2 Magazine."
 My favorites.
- Ooh, sparkly water!
 Eww, who drinks
"pomelo" flavor?
 [doorbell rings]
 - Oh, good,
the other guests are here.
 And I got your favorite drink.:
 - Oh, I didn't realize
this was a "party" party.
 - It's just the five of us.
 I can't wait for you guys
to get to know each other.
 I thought we could play
a getting-to-know-you game.
 On each card is a fun fact
about someone in this room.
 Your job is to guess who.
 Miguel, you can go first.
 - "I like
pumpkin spice lattes."
 I'm gonna guess Mandee.
- [gasps]
 You're right.
How'd you know?
 - [disparaging laugh]
If your name's Mandee,
 liking pumpkin spice lattes
is pretty much
 your entire brand.
 - Wow, you guys know each other
so well already.
 Jackie, your turn.
 - "I have a winning smile."
 [giggles]
Well, that must be
 about Mandee.
- Actually,
 it was about Miguel.
 - Hmm, I don't see it.
 - I'm done with this game.
- Huh, which card says,
 "I'm a quitter"?
 - Uh, why don't we try
something else?
 Okay, I'll go first.
 Right foot apple.
 Mandee, why don't you go next?
 - Leni knows I'm good
at this game.
 Oh, left foot pineapple.
 - I'm pretty good at it, too.
 I'm a part-time
yoga instructor, so...
 Right foot grape.
 Leni, I didn't tell you.
 Yesterday, I had to deal with
a total Penny.
 - Oh, no, that's awful.
 A "Penny"
is what we call someone
 who tries using
an expired coupon.
 - You kind of have
to work with us to get it.
 - Leni, did you see
 Rashida's prom-posal
to Brandon?
 It was so addy-addy-bing-bang.
 - That's our friend word
for "adorable."
 - You kind of have
to go to school with us
 to get it.
 - Leni, I mean to thank you
for helping me get through
 that awful 12-hour sale.
 I was thinking about
how working together
 is pretty much
the deepest bond there is.
 - Really?
 'Cause I was thinking
that true friendship
 isn't something you can find
on a rack.
 [combative music]
 - [gasps]
My pomelo!
 - My bag!
- It was an accident.
 I'm sorry I'm not
a part-time yoga instructor.
 - Leni, this was
a terrible idea.
 Why did you want us
to hang out with them?
 - Well, believe me, we didn't
want to hang out with you.
 - [huffs]
We're leaving.
 - Don't bother, we're leaving.
 [all grunting]
 - Guys, wait!
 We didn't get to eat
 the "New Best Friends" cake
I baked.
 - Sorry, Leni.
 And by the way, Miguel,
 everyone likes pumpkin spice.
 Except maybe stuck-up
part-time yoga instructors.
 - [gasps]
 [tense music]
 - Wow, poor Leni.
 She's literally
bending over backwards
 for her friends.
- [groans]
 [yelps]
 - [groans]
These clothes will go out
 of style before I get
to try them on.
 - Oh, it's you.
 Ugh.
- Didn't Leni tell you
 that fuchsia
was last season's color?
 - Mm, guess she didn't tell you
 that you can't pull off
those jeans.
 - [horrified gasp]
- That's it.
 Leni, come out.
You have to choose.
 Either them or us.
 Oops.
[awkward laugh]
 My bad.
 Wait, isn't Leni
with you guys?
 - We thought she was with you.
 [gasps]
Is she blowing us all off?
 - On this week's episode
of "Best Friends Forever,"
 Kurt is torn
between suede fringe
 and classic pinstripe.
- Luckily, my best friends
 are here to help me choose
the perfect vest.
 - [weeping]
 [phone ringing]
 Hello?
- Leni, what the heck?
 Where are you?
- Oh, hey.
 How's the pop-up sale?
- Never mind that.
 You ditched us.
 Do you have another group
of friends we don't know about?
 - I'm sorry.
 I knew that no matter
who I went to the sale with
 I'd be upsetting someone,
so I decided to stay home.
 I'll let you guys go.
 I don't want to ruin your day.
 - Wow.
 Leni missed her favorite sale
because of us.
 - Ugh.
 We are the worst.
 - Leni, we need to talk to you.
- We overheard your phone call
 and we're worried about you.
 It's not your fault
if your friends
 can't get along.
- It's not?
 - No, and if they can't
hang out together,
 they'll just have to learn
to share you.
 - You know what? You're right.
 - Now you march over
to the store and tell hem
 that they're gonna have
to grow up.
 - Yeah, I will do that!
 [rousing music]
 Oh, you're here.
Well, good.
 There's something I have
to say to you.
 - Actually, there's something
we have to say to you.
 - No, me first.
 If you can't share the store,
then you're going to have
 to march over to the room
and grow me up.
 Wait, that's not right.
 Dang it, I was gonna
practice this on the bus.
 - Leni, never mind that.
 We came to apologize.
 - We've been acting
like total jerks.
 I'm sorry we got so jealous.
 - Even if the four of us
aren't gonna be besties,
 we can at least try
to get along.
 - 'Cause the last thing
any of us want is to lose you
 as a friend.
- Aww.
 That's supes sweet.
 Thanks, you guys.
 Hey, do you want to come in?
 I was just watching
"Best Friends Forever."
 both: I love that show!
 - [laughing]
R--right?
 I mean, how could you
go wrong?
 - That vest is so
addy-addy-bing-bang
 - Hey, this pomelo's
really tasty.
 Good call, Miguel.

 - [yells]
 [sniffs]
Do I smell cookies?
 - Yeah, but don't waste
your time.
 They're "not for family."
 [lighthearted music]
 - Hey, Stinkin', think fast.
 [munching]
- Lynn!
 - It's okay, we needed
a taste-tester.
 I'm worried the bottoms
are soggy.
 - Nope, nice crunch.
 What are they for?
- Clyde and I have
 middle-school orientation
tomorrow.
 - [splutters]
You guys are coming
 to my school?
- Yeah!
 We got assigned
an 8th grade buddy
 who's gonna take us around
and show us
 what the next three years
of our lives will be like.
 - And we want to make
a good impression,
 so we're coming prepared.
 Designed these ourselves.
 - "Clincoln McCloud- BFFs."
 Cookies and business cards?
 That's your plan?
- I'm also planning
 to use word association
to learn everyone's names.
 Like, "Lynn once bruised
 my shin."
 - Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, time out.
 This stuff might fly
in elementary school, okay?
 But middle school is different.
 It's the jungle.
 If you walk in there
looking like a couple
 of weak chumps,
you'll get eaten alive.
 [jaguar growls]
 both: Eaten alive?
 - Does that mean
we should reconsider
 wearing matching turtlenecks?
- Ugh.
 - Don't worry,
LJ's got your back.
 - [garbled voice]
- Yo, Principal Ramirez.
 Lynn Loud.
Hey, listen, who can I talk to
 about becoming
an orientation buddy?
 - Psst, don't throw out
those business cards.
 They might still work
for high school.
 [dramatic musical flourish]
 [peppy music]
 [indistinct chatter]
Lincoln!
 Check out those columns!
 Do you think they're
real marble?
 - Probably.
 This place is so much bigger
than our school.
 Good thing they gave us maps.
 - Huh?
 Guys, guys, guys,
ditch the maps.
 First rule of survival:
 Don't act like a total noob.
 - But we are noobs.
 - Yeah, and if some
upperclassman realizes that,
 you'll be a prime target
for pranks.
 Like the kid who asked
an eighth grader for directions
 on the first day of school.
 The poor fool got sent
on a wild-goose-chase
 down in the tunnels
under the school
 and didn't make it out
until the whole day was over.
 [ominous music]
 [both gasp]
 both: Don't... be... noobs.
 [bell rings]
 - Okay, homeroom.
 There are no assigned seats,
so it's time
 for rule number two:
Don't get stuck with
 a crummy desk.
 Move out!
 - Oh, sorry.
 Please, it's all yours.
 I'd pull out the chair
for you, but...
 [clears throat]
It's attached.
 - Wrong.
 Hey, back off, pigtails.
 My buddy saw this first.
 [grunts]
Boom, dominant.
 Nobody's messing with that.
 Hah.
- Uh, wasn't that
 a little aggressive?
- [grunts]
 Not if you don't want
to end up like the kid
 who got stuck with
the worst desk in the room.
 [ominous music]
 [cruel laughter]
 This one kid thought she had
the perfect desk,
 but ended up getting stuck
in it so tight
 that they had to call
the school cook.
 - Sorry, kid.
 We're gonna have to
grease you out.
 You got any nut allergies?
 [menacing laughter]
 both: Don't get stuck
with crummy desks.
 - Okay, next is Bio.
 Suit up.
- Cool!
 I've always wanted to wear
a lab coat.
 - Welcome, fifth graders.
 We are continuing our work
with live mealworms today,
 so everyone grab a case
from the back of the class.
 - [grunts]
 [all screaming]
 - Sorry, guys!
 That was my fault.
 I was up late making...
- [hollering]
 - Lynn, what the heck?
 - Rule number three:
Never own up
 to making a mistake.
- But I spilled the worms.
 - So?
Do you want to be like
 the sixth grader who--hang on,
Clyde needs to hear this, too.
 - [whimpering]
 - Do you want to be like
the sixth-grader who owned up
 to farting during
a standardized test?
 [ominous music]
 - Hey, look,
it's Farty McStink Pants!
 both: Own up to nothing.
 - [growling]
- [laughs]
 Loving the agro body language.
 Here you go.
 Double-meatball subs
with extra sriracha.
 - Thanks.
 I'm normally not
a hot sauce guy,
 but after this morning
I'm feeling dangerous.
 [munching]
 - Great, so my rules
are sinking in?
 - Yeah, some kid just came over
 to ask if she could borrow
a chair,
 and guess what Clyde said?
 - [deep voice]
I don't think so, pal.
 - Boom.
 McBride for the win.
 - So what are we doing
after lunch?
 - Well, actually,
we orientation buddies
 are supposed to let you guys
fly solo for the rest
 of the day.
 See how you do on your own.
- Really?
 - Already?
- Don't worry.
 You guys totally got this.
 Now, hands in.
 Three, two, one...
 all: Dominate!
- Wow, Clyde,
 your hands are so soft.
 - Oh, thank you.
- We'll work on that.
 - First class of the afternoon:
 "The Wonders of Watercolors."
 - To the Art department!
 Uh, which way is that again?
 - Maybe if we just take
a quick peek at the map...
 - No!
Lynn's first rule, remember?
 Don't look like a noob.
- Right.
 [bell ringing]
 - [both gasp]
 [doors slamming]
 - Oh, no,
we're gonna be tardy!
 - Hey, you guys lost?
 - Nice try, bucko!
 But we're not falling
for one of your
 upper classmen pranks.
 [hyperventilating]
- Way to dominate, Clyde.
 "Bucko" was a nice touch.
- Thanks.
 My dads were watching
a cop show last night.
 [ambient music]
 - This looks like
the Art department.
 Maybe this is
the watercolor room.
 [kids hollering]
 - Are you kidding me?
- Go away!
 - Is this "The Wonders
of Watercolors"?
 - No, this is
"Fun With Photography,"
 and you just ruined
a whole months' work.
 I'll see you jerks
after school.
 Meet me on the blacktop
at 3:00.
 - You think she's inviting us
to play a game of tetherball?
 - No, that's where we fight.
 [both swallow]
 - Okay, so we ticked off
one photo student,
 but I'm sure we can
smooth everything over
 after school.
- I'm already writing
 the apology letter in my head.
- Come on, let's grab a seat
 Remember rule number two!
 These look nice and sturdy.
- Plus, we can make
 great eye contact
with the teacher from here.
 - Oh.
Hey, dudes.
 Those are actually our seats.
 - [clears throat]
We saw them first, bud.
 - Um, okay.
 Well, seats are assigned,
 and those are
legitimately ours.
 - Pssh, a likely story.
 [bell ringing]
 - Come on, man!
- Byron, Cici,
 what are you doing

so many enemies?
 We don't even go here yet.
- Relax.
 This is our last class
of the day.
 Let's just keep a low profile
and try not to make
 anyone else hate us.
- Got it.
 - Okay, people,
I spent all morning
 buffing the dumb floor
for the PTA banquet
 so no dodgeball today.
 You're watching
a movie instead.
 [all cheering]
 - Perfect.
 There's no way
we can mess this up.
 [shoes squeaking]
 [both shout, grunt]
 - [gasps]
- [screams]
 [metal clattering]
 - Who's responsible for this?
 - Remember rule number three:
 never own up
to making a mistake.
 - Well, since no one's fessin'
to the messin',
 you can forget that movie.
 You're all cleaning up instead.

 but people didn't think
we're tough.
 - They just think we're jerks,
 and I'm not sure I disagree.
 - Yeah, so thanks
for the great advice.

 from what happened to me.
 both: Huh?

 Um, excuse me,
could you tell me
 how to get to the gym?

 Just head down

 was about you?
- Yep.

They were all me.

 all chanting:
Farty pants! Farty pants!
 - I finally figured out
that if I acted tough,
 people would stop
messing with me,
 and since it worked for me
I thought it could help
 protect you guys, too.
 - Wow, I had no idea
you went through all that.
 - Me neither,
and it was nice of you
 to try and help us,
even though it's gonna lead
 to a lot of pain.

- No, it's not,
 because I'm gonna take
the heat for you guys.
 both: No, no, no!
- We have to go.
 - Some of those kids
might still be here next year.
 They're gonna think we're wimps

be so bad?
 Okay, okay.
