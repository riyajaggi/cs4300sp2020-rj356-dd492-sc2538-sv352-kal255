 - Hey, there,
happy holidays to you.
 Make yourselves comfy,
 'cause Old Flip's got
a Thanksgiving tale to tell ya.
 [slurps]
Ah.
 'Twas the day before
Thanksgiving
 and the Loud and Casagrande
families
 were getting ready
for the big shebang.
 - OMG, Boo Boo Bear, I am
so excited for Turkey Day.
 - Me too. We haven't spent it
with the Casagrandes
 in like five years.
When we lived in Royal Woods,
 Mom always had to work the
Thanksgiving shift
 at the hospital.
 [spooky music]
 both: Ah!
- [moans]
 - Oh, this is just
cranberry sauce.
 I tripped on the way over.
 - It wasn't great,
 but I was always up
to date on my booster shots.
 - [laughs] Hey, Bobby,
check out all the cool stuff
 my family's doing
for Thanksgiving.
 [eyes squeak]
 - Hey, Lynn.
- What's up, Bobby?
 - Digging the new look.
 - [chuckles]
These are not for fashion.
 They are my pee pants.
 This way I don't have
to miss any of the meal
 or the football game by running
to the bathroom like a chump.
 Test run.
 - Is she gonna pee her pants?
 - Aw.
[pants slap]
 Mm.
Noice.
 Dry as a bone.
 - So much for my chicken stock.
 - How's the turkey coming, Dad?
- Hah.
 Turkey's are for amateurs,
Lori-lou.
 I'm making a tur-goose-on.
A pigeon
 stuffed inside a goose,
stuffed inside a turkey.
 Three times the bird,
three times the deliciousness.
 - Ooh.
- [squawks] Triple homicide.
 - Ooh, mashed potatoes.
both: Scram!
 - Nice try, sister, but as
officers of the Fest Force,
 it's our job to protect
this food till tomorrow.
 - I was just--
- We said scram!
 - Where were you two when Lynn
took my chicken stock?
 both: [growling]
 - Babe, we got a lot
cooking on our end too.
 - Oh, show me.
 - Oh, I wish you could smell
Abuela's famous tamales.
 [sniffs]
Ow.
 - No, Roberto, there are only
enough tamales for dinner.
 [horns blare]
 - Ah.
 Abuela doesn't need guards.
 She's her own
one-woman Feast Force.
 - [chuckles]
 - Here's your pass-out pillow,
Lincoln.
 - Oh, every year Lincoln
eats so much turkey
 he falls asleep at the table
and misses dessert.
 - But not this year.
I've got a plan.
 If I start to feel sleepy,
 I'll just dip my head
in this bucket of ice water,
 like so.
Ah! I need a new plan.
 - Carlos, put the book down.
I need to see your eyes.
 - [groans]
 - Tia Frida paints a family
portrait every year,
 and this year's theme is
"emotionally raw vegetables."
 Huh?
- How's the fit?
 - Uh, a little tight.
- I can make some alterations.
 - Ah.
 - Ooh, is someone
playing guitar?
 - That's Abuelo.
 He serenades the family
every year at Thanksgiving.
 - Let me just tune my guitar.
 Sergio, give me a G.
 - [squawks]
G.
 [string springs]
 - The Mercado does
a canned food drive every year.
 - I call it "Yes, we can."
- Very clever, CJ.
 - And now that I'm joining him,
we're gonna double
 last year's donations.
 CJ, look, it's Mr. Park.
He hasn't donated yet.
 - Get him.
 - Wait, come back, GravyBot.
 - Gravy?
- Excuse you?
 [gravy squirts]
Ah.
 - Apologies,
first-born sibling.
 Just doing a test run
with GravyBot,
 the robot I built to ensure
equal gravy distribution.
 I'll send in Clean-Up-Bot.
- No. No more bots.
 I got it.
 - Your Thanksgiving
looks awesome, babe.
 - So does yours.
[sighs]
 I just wish we could
spend it together.
 - Me too.
 - This ought to keep me awake
till dessert.
 - Wait,
why can't we be together?
 What if I came to the city
 to spend Thanksgiving
with your fam?
 - [gasps]
 - Or I could come to Royal
Woods to be with your family.
 - What?
- Both sound great.
 You decide.
- Aw, babe.
 I can't do decisions.
 You know how I get in
restaurants when they ask,
 "Booth or table?"
 [cans rattle, clank]
 Uh-oh,
I'll call you back tonight.
 I think something
fell in the bleach-cat food-
 guitar strings aisle.
 all: They're thinking
of doing what?
 - No one in our family has
ever missed a Thanksgiving.
 - But we're all
finally together.
 - What if Bobby likes it
so much at the Louds
 that he wants to spend
Christmas there too?
 - First it's Thanksgiving,
next thing you know,
 we lose her for every holiday.
 - Guys, we still have time.
 They haven't decided
where to go.
 - Maybe if we can show Bobby
how much he'd be missed--
 - He won't wanna leave.
 - Maybe we can
convince Lori that leaving
 would be a grave mistake.
 all: Let's do this.
 [door knocks]
 [door creaks]
 - Hmm, meet in the kitchen?
 [playful music]
 - You got our note.
 - Still hungry?
 [chains clank]
 - Ooh.
- Go ahead.
 Have a little taste.
We won't say anything.
 - Wait a minute,
is this a trap?
 This seems like a trap.
- No way.
 We would never trap
our favorite sister.
 Oldest and most important.
 - Yeah, I literally am.
 - Lori, there you are.
Come here for a sec.
 ♪
 I was just doing
the costume fittings
 for our turkey-pardoning skit.
 Quick,
bring Judge Lori her robe.
 - Here you go, Your Honor.
 - And here's our new turkey.
 Aren't you excited, Lily?
 We've all been
pardoned by Lori,
 and now it's your turn.
 - [babbling, gobbling]
 - Aw.
 - Can you dudes imagine
a Thanksgiving skit
 without our rad judge?
I sure can't.
 - Me neither.
She's our MVP.
 - Why are you guys
acting so weird?
 - Us? Weird? What?
 - Oh, Lori.
 I was just hanging all
the hand turkeys you kids have
 made over the years
and I came across the one
 that started it all.
 - Aw, my kindergarten turkey.
- Look at that.
 All 11 of my turkeys
up there together.
 One big, happy family,
the way it's always been,
 and hopefully always will be.
[fingers cracking]
 - Mom, you're hurting my hand.
 ♪
 - [sniffing]
 - Roberto, I didn't know
you were home.
 - Do I smell--[sniffing]
- My buñuelos?
 Why, yes.
 - They're my all-time favorite.
 - They are?
Huh, I didn't remember.
 Please, have one.
 - Wait,
didn't you tell me before
 I wasn't allowed
to taste anything?
 - Nonsense. I never said that.
It's been five long years
 since I've had the chance
 to cook a Thanksgiving meal
for you.
 [sobs]
You can have whatever you want.
 - [munching]
Mmm, mmm.
 - Here, have some more.
 - You made pozole too?
 Another one of my faves.
- Shh, shh, keep eating.
 - Mmm.
 - Hey, Bobby, come join us.
 We were just making our
traditional paper chain
 of all the things
we're thankful for.
 - I already wrote mine.
"I'm so glad the Santiagos
 "are back with us this year,
all three of them."
 - See, big brother?
Everyone's so happy
 that we're together again.
 - And hopefully
will be forever.
 [menacing music]
 - Guys, you're hurting my arms.
 - Hey, Lori, I'm workshopping
this year's Thanksgiving poem.
 Can I get your opinion?
 I call it
"Ode to an Empty Chair."
 [clears throat] Appetizers
have been vanquished,
 the meal has come to pass,
dessert is on the horizon,
 yet this space remains so vast.
 Where once sat a warm body,
now there is only cold wood.
 [knocks wood]
 All that remains is
a lock of blonde hair,
 a reminder of
what was once good.
 [turkey gobbles]
 - Ah, Lucy.
 - So, what do you think?
- [grunts]
 Okay, that's it.
 - I just heard
the most horrible thing.
 Saul from Saul's Sandwich Shop
heard from Street Meat Malik
 that Vito Filliponio's son
is spending Thanksgiving
 at his friend's house.
 [dramatic musical flourish]
both: [gasp]
 - Can you imagine the pain
he's causing his family?
 What a sin?
- Okay, that's it.
 both: Family meeting.
 - I literally know you guys
are up to something.
 Out with it.
- And be honest with me.
 - [groans]
- Fine.
 We know that you might
go to the Casagrandes
 for Thanksgiving.
- [gasps]
 You've been
eavesdropping on me?
 - Lincoln did it.
- Dad.
 - What? She forced it
out of me, son.
 - Look, honey, Thanksgiving
means so much to our family.
 - Thanksgiving means
so much to our family.
 - The thought of our first-born
not spending it with us--
 I don't wanna get too
emotional, but--
 - [thump, sobbing]
Please don't go.
 - Aw.
 - You were gone
for so many years,
 and now that
you're back with us--
 I'm an old man, Bobby.
[coughs]
 I don't know how much time
we have left together.
 - [sniffles]
Ah.
 - Boo Boo Bear.
I have something to tell you.
 - I have something to,
uh, tell you too.
 both: You first.
 I can't leave my family
for Thanksgiving.
 - Ah, babe,
what are we gonna do?
 - What if,
just for this one year,
 we all have
Thanksgiving together?
 - That's a great idea.
Our families haven't met.
 It'll be perfect.
- Just one problem.
 - How are we gonna decide
whose family should--
 all: Host.
 - Seriously? You guys
are eavesdropping again?
 Ah.
 - It would be an honor
for us to host your family
 here in the city.
- No, we insist.
 You should come to Royal Woods.
 [overlapping chatter]
 - Guys, guys,
let's just flip a coin
 and winner gets to host.
Bobby, you call it.
 - Heads, no, wait, uh, tails.
 Uh, uh, heads.
Yep, definitely heads.
 - It's tails.
[cheering]
 - Of course this one
would call heads.
 - We're not
out of the woods yet.
 What about next year,
and the year after that?
 We need to show Bobby and Lori
 that this is where they wanna
spend all future Thanksgivings.
 - [gasps] Your father's right.
We need to throw
 the greatest holiday ever.
 - Well, that's it.
It's over.
 - Nonsense. The Louds may have
won the battle,
 but we will win the war.
 We just need to bring
our Thanksgiving to them.
 - If we show Bobby and Lori
that we do Thanksgiving better
 then the Louds,
they'll wanna spend it
 with us next year.
- And every year after that.
 - Yeah, watch out,
Louds, 'cause--
 all: It's on.
 - Ah, ah--oh!
 Whoops.
Didn't realize you were back.
 Oh, so where was I?
 Ah, right. Turkey Day was here
and the Louds were getting
 ready for a showdown
with the Casa Gs.
 - Chop-chop with those
streamers, girls.
 We really have to dazzle
Lori and Bobby
 with these decorations.
 Leni, weren't you gonna
put a leaf in the table?
 - I did.
Hello?
 - Uh, honey,
 why don't you go help
your father in the kitchen?
 Lincoln, I need you
to polish these spoons.
 - Ow.
- What're you doing?
 - Ow. Trying to see if
pulling out my eyebrows
 will keep my awake for dessert.
- Spoons.
 Lola, you were supposed
to choose a photo
 of Bobby and Lori, not you.
- What're you talking about?
 - They're right there.
- Try again.
 [horn honks]
 - [gasps] It's the Casagrandes.
 [suspenseful jazz music]
 - Hi, I'm CJ.
Do you have any cans?
 - [chuckles] Also,
happy Thanksgiving.
 - Welcome.
[overlapping chatter]
 - Boo Boo Bear.
- Hey, babe.
 - Punk.
- Loser.
 - Now, I know you said
not to bring anything,
 but I didn't wanna be rude
and show up empty-handed.
 - Oh, please. I think we can
make room for one little dish.
 - All right, back it up, boys.
 [truck beeping]
 [truck door opens and closes]
 - Don't worry, honey.
 There's no way they're
gonna upstage your meal.
 - Hi, this is a pig on a spit.
Where would you like it?
 both: Kitchen.
 - Wow, look at this place.
It's so festive, Mrs. L.
 - [chuckles] Well, Bobby,
we Louds go all out
 for Thanksgiving.
 - These store-bought
decorations are nice, Rita.
 Though as
a professional artist,
 I prefer the handmade touch.
 - Aw, you made Bobby and me
two peas in a pod.
 That's so sweet.
 - And the room feels
more personal.
 - So much better,
- Much better.
 - Literally, it's love.
- So good, Tia.
 - Well played, Casagrandes,
but don't count the Louds out
 just yet.
 - If everyone would
please find a seat
 for our annual
Thanksgiving skit.
 - They have a skit?
- Huh?
 - [gasps]
We're on it.
 - Dah--no, Bobby.
 We saved you a seat right here
in the front row.
 - Excuse me.
Perdoname.
 [slurps]
 [beeps]
 [suspenseful trial music]
 - Welcome.
What you're about to see
 is a case of the bird's so cute
you can gobble her up.
 All rise for
the Honorable Lori Loud.
 ♪
 And now let's
meet the defendant,
 Turkey Lily.
 - [gobbles]
 - Aw, she's adorable.
 - Officially commence
the People vs. Lilly Loud.
 [gavel knocks]
 both: [eyes squeak]
 [ominous music]
 [gavel knocking]
 - Your verdict?
 - We the jury find
the defendant guilty.
 [dramatic bell rings]
- No, this is an outrage.
 - Guilty of being
the cutest turkey ever.
 - [giggles]
 - Ah, what a relief.
 - Babe, your performance
was amazing.
 - Hey, let's talk about finding
a role for you next year.
 [in a Southern accent]
Eh, I say, uh,
 how does juror number seven
sound?
 - [gasps]
- Dang it.
 They've sucked in Bobby
with his weakness for theater.
 Well played, Louds, but never
underestimate the Casagrandes.
 [dramatic musical flourish]
 - What's this?
 - Our annual turkey dance,
of course.
 Follow our lead.
Uno, dos, tres.
 - Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-hi.
 [upbeat music]
 all: [gobbling]
 - Ha-ha-ha-hi-yi-yi.

nothing to worry about.
 - Yeah, this is terrible.
- This is great.
 Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

 - Don't worry.
Dinner is the decisive battle.
 That's where we're gonna
Lynn-cinerate them.
 - Dinner.
 [overlapping chatter]
 There they are.
- [vocalizes horns]
 - Lori, Bobby.
We saved you a spot.
 - No, we saved you a spot.
 - Um, how about
we sit in the middle?
 - Uh, here, try my turkey
skin-infused stuffing.
 You're gonna love it.
- But first, try my tamales.
 I added an extra kick.
- [chuckles] An extra kick.
 That's cute.
They don't want heat.
 They want sweet.
Here kids,
 taste my
marshmallow-covered potatoes.
 - [snickers] How do you know
what they want?
 They're clearly craving my
homemade shredded turkey mole.

 both: [groaning]
 ♪
 [glass clinks]
 - I'd like to make a toast.
 Bobby, Lori, I just wanna
say how much it means
 to have you here with us.
 I don't know if
I can get through this.
 - Oh, Mom.
[glass clinks]
 - Uh, excuse me, if I might.
 I'm sure it means a lot to you,
Rita, but with all respect,
 it means more to us.
 - Well, Hector, that seems
really unlikely,
 because nothing means
more to us, okay?
 - Oh, really? Is that so?
- Yeah, yeah, that's right.
 - Forget the toast.
I can say it so much better
 with music.

 It is not safe to have
Thanksgiving in this house.
 - Well, if you don't like it,
you're welcome to leave.
 Not you, Bobby,
you can stay.
 - That's what you want,
isn't it?
 To steal our precious
Roberto away from us.
 - Oh, oh, oh, like you haven't
been trying
 to steal Lori from us.
Well, guess what, buck-o,
 it's not gonna happen.
- Guys, guys, please stop.
 all: Stay out of this.
 - Why would anybody wanna
spend Thanksgiving here
 gnawing on your dry bird?
- [whimpering]
 - The tur-goose-on
is delicious.
 Maybe the problem
is your lumpy gravy.
 - Did someone say gravy?
[gravy splashes]
 - Ah!
- No, they don't deserve it.
 - Ah. Malfunction.

That's enough.
 I know a way to settle this.
- Yeah. Arm wrestle.
 Let's go.
- No.
 Let's just ask Lori and Bobby
 where they would rather
spend Thanksgiving.
 - Huh, where'd they go?
 - And that's how
Bobby and Lori ended up
 at the only place in town
that's open 24/7, 365.
 Except during fishing season.
 - I'm sorry, Boo Boo Bear.
 I know you were looking forward
 to having a real
Thanksgiving this year.
 - It's not all bad.
 I found this
half-off turkey jerky.
 [horn honks]
 [tires screech]
 [overlapping chatter]
 - Jumping jerky.
Holy hotdogs.
 - Whoa, how did you guys
find us?
 - Tracking devices.
 - You left before trying
my twice-baked tart.
 - [scoffs] They would
prefer my flan.
 - Flan shman.
Tart, tart, tart.
 - Stop.
Don't you guys see?
 This is why we left.
We couldn't stand the fighting
 and competing.
 - We don't want
to choose sides.
 So maybe from now on,
 we should just spend
Thanksgiving by ourselves.
 [rousing music]
 - Well, nobody wants that.
- We certainly don't.
 - Lori, Bobby, I'm sorry we've
been acting so childlishly.
 - We're sorry too.
 It's just so hard
to let go of your kids.
 You know what?
You should get Lori and Bobby
 for Thanksgiving.
 - Well, goodness know
we haven't done anything
 to deserve that.
They should spend it with you.
 - Hey, I got an idea.
 Why don't you just
rotate every year, huh?
 Much like the juicy hotdogs I'm
selling at a mere 40% mark-up.
 Holiday discount.
- Works for us.
 - Great idea.
- Yeah.
 - I'm glad we figured out
future years,
 but what about right now?
I'm starving.
 - Well, we've got hotdogs
and sunflower seeds
 and twenty kinds
of artisanal jerky.
 Maybe we could throw
a dinner together here.
 - I'm game.
- Me too.
 - We could make this place
look festive.
 I think I have some leftover
decorations in the car.
 - I'll help you.
 - So that's the story of how
old Flip saved Thanksgiving.
 Both families coming together
to give thanks
 and celebrate the abundance
that is the old Food and Fuel.
 - Rosa, this chili-cheese-dog
stuffing is divine.
 The habanero sauce
was a nice touch.
 - I never leave home
without it.
 - It's the perfect combination
of store-bought and homemade.
 - I can't believe I finally
got dessert this year.
 And a whole aisle's worth.
 - And I can't believe
we hit our donation goal
 for the food drive.
- Thanks, Flip.
 - Eh, don't mention it.
 If word gets out that
Flip's a soft touch,
 it's all over.
- What do you think, babe?
 Best T-giving ever?
- Literally our best so far.
 Thanks, Boo Boo Bear.
 both: A toast.
- To Thanksgiving traditions.
 - Old and new.
 - Old and new.
- Salud.
 - You dudes are tugging
at my heartstrings,
 which means I gotta tug
at my guitar strings.
 - How about a duet?
