 And then there's me. [sighs] I've tried everything to get into this case. [triumphant music starts and stops] [crickets chirping] [crowd groans] [siren blips] - And the winner of the Little Miss Cutie Pie Pageant is Liiiiinnnn...dsey Sweetwater! [cheers and applause] - But now I finally have my chance. The fifth grade video contest. Whoever's video gets the most votes wins this beauty. [exhales] - You really think you're going to win, Lincoln? - With what I have planned, I'm a shoe-in. - You said the same thing about the Cutie Pie pageant. - I was robbed! Grab your camera. Are we rolling? Hey, fifth grade, Lincoln Loud here. Ever wonder what happens when 672 breath mints meet 88 gallons of diet soda? Well, you're about to find out! [upbeat rock music] [cat yowls] ♪ - That was amazing! You're right, everyone's gonna vote for this. - Why isn't anybody voting for this? - Maybe 'cause they're all voting for this HamstaCam video. [hamster wheel squeaks] - 50 votes? Pshh! What's so great about some dumb hamster? [Geo chitters] Not you, Geo. You're awesome. - Hey, we got a vote! No, wait, it's a comment. - "Nice try, but you should go "to your big sister's site for some tips. Her videos are sick." - Sick? Oh, no! Do you think they have a virus? - It means awesome, Clyde. Click the link. Luan Out Loud's Comedy Channel. Cute, but how many people want to watch Luan-- 50,000 followers? Clyde, do you know what this means? - People waste a lot of time on the Internet? - No, it means Luan can help us win the video contest. Come on! - Uh-huh. - Pretty sick, right? - That means awesome. - Yeah, not in this case. - What? - Sorry, Linc, stunts are so last year. If you want to win the contest, you have to make funny videos. - Well, how do I make those? - Easy, you just follow my one simple rule. Keep your camera on at all times because you never know when you'll strike comedy gold. Ooh, like this. - Ah, come on! Erase that. - Don't worry, Clyde, I would never post it without your permission. Besides, I said comedy gold, not digging for gold. - We've had the camera on all day. Where exactly is this comedy gold? Clyde, are you listening to me? - Sorry, Lincoln, I was just worried that Lynn was going to accidentally step on that rake, resulting in a series of escalating mishaps. - That's great, Clyde, but-- series of escalating mishaps? - 56, 57, 58, 59-- ouch! [screams] - That was hilarious! - Let's go upload it. This is gonna get a ton of votes. - I don't know, Clyde, enough votes to beat HamstaCam? - HamstaCam! - If we struck comedy gold with one sister, with ten we'll have comedy Fort Knox! [both laugh evilly] - Just like me idol, Mick Swagger. All right! [pants rip] Oh! Ooh, drafty. [both giggle] - Oh, Edwin, I know you're forbidden to love a mortal like me, but I can't resist your piercing gaze, your sparkly skin, your icy lips. Mmm! - Hm, maybe something like this is a little too personal. - HamstaCam just got ten more votes. - HamstaCam! Eh, it's not that personal. Keep rolling. ♪ [flatulence] - [snoring] ♪ [flatulence] ♪ - Oh! ♪ [flatulence] [window squeaks] - Ahh, Lori's toots. It's like music to my ears. - Now this is gonna beat HamstaCam. Let's go upload it. ♪ [overlapping excited chatter] - Lincoln, your video rocks. You've got my vote. - Man, Lucy and that sculpture? What a weirdo! - And how about Lori? - You mean Miss Toots-a-lot? She should see a doctor about that. [laughter] - So embarrassing. - Embarrassing? - Yeah, my sisters would pulverize me if I posted a video like that. - Pulverize? - You can't get pulverized, Lincoln. I'd never be able to find another best friend. - You won't have to. After I win the trophy on Friday, I'll just delete the video. - Just in case. We had a good run, buddy. - Don't worry, Clyde. My sisters will never know. [dramatic music] - They know. [overlapping angry chatter] - Wait, wait, wait! Let me explain. - You've got exactly three seconds before we pulverize you. - [pops knuckles] [stopwatch ticks] - There was this video contest at school and I really wanted to win. - You showed my sleep face for some stupid contest? - I just wanted to have a trophy to put in the case like you guys. - You think you deserve a trophy for that, bro? - No, I don't deserve it. Look, I'll delete the video! - Too late, Lincoln, the damage has already been done. - You made me look like a fool! - You made me look like a freak. - You made me look like I fart! And for the record, it was these shoes! See? [grunts] Of course it's not working now. - Lori, I'm sorry! Wait! Luna, let me explain. - [playing guitar] Can't hear you, bro! - Leni, Lori, I'm sorry! - You literally disgust me. - Yeah! Ugh! - Lola, Lana, please! - You're uninvited to my birthday party, forever! - [sighs] - I want to slam it, too! - Lisa! Lisa? "Vengeance shall be mine." Guys, come on, I'm your brother. - [growls] - I have no brother. I know I say that a lot, but this time I mean it. - Luan, you got to help me. I was only doing what you said. - You broke the unspoken rule. Never post a video without the person's permission. - Why didn't you tell me that? - Because it's unspoken. - [sighs] How am I going to fix this? Well, good-bye, trophy. - Deleted. - Well, HamstaCam, looks like you win. [hamster wheel squeaks] I guess it's hard for anyone to have the camera on you all the time. Camera on you all the time! That's it! Luan, you said your one simple rule is to always have your camera on, right? - That is correct, Captain Obvious. - Then I'm gonna need to borrow all your footage of me. - You mean Comedy Fort Knox? - Hey, fifth grade, Lincoln Loud here. Ever wonder what happens when one brother messes up and embarrasses all ten of his sisters? I didn't think you would. But this is how you fix it.

And still to lose out to a hamster? Ouch! - [sighs] [somber music] ♪ [sighs] I sure hope that worked. [dramatic music] It didn't work. - Lincoln... - I know I embarrassed you and I can't undo that, and I'm sorry, but the least I could do was embarrass myself right along with you. That way we'd all be even. - Even? You think this makes us even? - Well, I was trying to-- - Yours was way worse. - Yeah, that video was hysterical. [overlapping chatter] - So we're good? - We're good, brother. - Sorry you didn't win the trophy. - But we really appreciate what you did and thought you deserved something. - [gasps] Wow!
