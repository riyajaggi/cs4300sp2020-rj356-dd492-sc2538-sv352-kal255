A vacation vacation. But getting here wasn't easy. In a family this big, a vacation costs a lot of money. - Line up for lemonade. - So we all had to do our part. - Oh, no, thank you. - I said, line up for lemonade! - I'll take five.

Two with extra sauce. - Honey, please discourage special orders. I'm backed up in here. [cash register rings] [coins clink] Oops. That was a mushroom. - [snores] - Hey. - Ooh, sorry. I've been working a lot of overtime lately. [cash register rings] [coins clink] Whoops. That was a molar. - Cinch that with a belt. Live on the edge with a polka dot skirt. Ugh, no, no. What did I tell you about wearing socks with sandals? - Aw, only if they're colorful or ironic. [cash register rings] - All done, Mrs. Parker. [chiming] I also do furniture moving and jar opening. Keep it in mind. - Oh, it's my lucky day. I dropped a jar of pickles under the sofa. [cash register rings] [carnival music] ♪ [children cheer] [cash register rings] - Dearly beloved, we gather today to say good-bye to Dorothy. She lived life to the fullest, whether she was swimming around her castle, blowing bubbles, or eating rocks. Turns out that last part wasn't the best idea. [toilet flushes] - Thank you. That was a beautiful service.

I'll pay you again to knock off that racket. - We already have enough money. - Hello?

Something's gotta go back. - How about this humungo bag? - Absolutely not. That one's very important. [bag rattles open] - Puzzles? - The bag stays. [angry chatter] - [whistles] Enough. Stand back and let me work. - How did you do that? - Quite simple, really. I merely used the formula combining elements of spatial analysis, and the basic physics theorems stating that for every object-- [doors close] Don't ask if you don't really wanna know. - Sorry, kiddo, we should get a move on. According to the reviews, the hotel has a very strict check-in policy. If we're not there by 8:00, they could give away our rooms. [engine starts] - Wait!

Come on, Dad, let's get our dignity back. - I'm right there with you, L.J. - Pass, pass, pass. - Father, this is not advisable.

How'd you do that? - Eh, it was no biggie. There was a crack in the cylinder block, so I just rerouted the exhaust manifold past the carburetor, and then-- Don't ask if you don't really wanna know. - Wait. Okay, now we can go. [horn blares] both: Dang it. - Oh, it's so hot. Dad, can you turn on the AC before my hair totally frizzes? [AC flutters] - Huh, doesn't seem to be working. - Ugh, the coolant must have leaked when we crashed. Pull over, Pops, I'll check it out. - No can do. Remember, 8:00 check-in. - well, can someone just roll down a window? - Sorry, honey, but if we roll any of these windows down, they're not coming back up. - I know it's hot, but just pretend you're at the beach. - In this?

The bad news is, now we have no door. No way I can reattach this baby. But I may have a solution. [crow caws] - Nice fix, but we still have a grave situation. [laughs] Get it? [doors close] [engine starts] What? Don't set me up if you don't wanna hear a joke. - Wait. - Ah.

I made them weeks ago. - Leni! - What? - That can't be good. - Well, I was so excited for the trip I wanted to get a head start. all: [moaning and groaning] - Uh-oh, I think I'm gonna barf. - I second that. - Puke fest. - Pull over, Dad. - No time--use a bag. - Lynn! - Okay, okay. [jazz music] - Oh, my gosh. - Out of the way. [hurried chatter, toilets flushing] - Leni, you're off lunch duty until further notice. - Yeah, let's just round that up to "forever." [country music] - Ha-ha, check out farmer Speedy. Not doing much passing now, are you? - Lynn, that's not very kind. Honey, we should help him. - Okay, but only if it takes less than ten minutes. [dramatic musical flourish] [dramatic piano music] - Need a hand with that flat, buddy? - Oh, that'd be swell. The spare is buried under all these crates. - Not a problem. Louds, assemble.

We just need to find a way to get to the hotel. - Boom! There's a bus station right down the street. - All right. - We can still do this. - Oh, wait, I just remembered... your wallet and my purse are both in Vanzilla. [dramatic musical flourish] - Open mic contest? We'll just have to raise some cash. And Ol' Ding-a-Ling Loud has a plan. - Now, Father, don't be so hard on yourself. Anyone could've lost the van. - What I meant was "ding-a-ling" as in my cowbell.

He flew jets in the military. - Mom, that is so cool. - That's nothing. You should see me pop wheelies in a tank, baby. - [gasps] Is there anything else we don't know about you, honey? Honey? Rita? - Some parts were missing so I had to improvise. - With a diaper? - A nighttime diaper. For extra strength. I even found some paint to give ol' shakey a face lift. And I painted Lori on the crop-duster. - Hmph, it doesn't even look like me. [heroic music] - Uh, you sure you know what you're doing? Got our whole family in here. [tires screech] - Ah! Except Lily.
