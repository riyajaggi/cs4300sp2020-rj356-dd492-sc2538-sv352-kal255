 Previously on "Burden of Truth"... Nobody knows how to make us better. She's spazzing! We're the freaks now, the Twitching Girls of Millwood. I am trying to land a job with Billy Crawford - and the city lawyer. - If we're not onto something, then why is someone following me? The contamination's not coming from any of the four sites. - Then where is it coming from? - The field itself. Someone has buried toxic waste in this field. You need to tell us where that container

 is going after it's been excavated. Hang on! We filed an Access to Information request for the environmental records of Matheson Steel. It's been ignored. We would ask that the court compel Matheson Steel to comply with their statutory obligations. To exonerate Matheson Steel and its parents company, we're offering a detailed summary of our disposal policy. A carefully crafted corporate smokescreen. I've written dozens of them. If Matheson Steel has nothing to hide, then show us the files. There's no proof that the barrels taken from the athletic field belong to my client,

 and if Miss Hanley and Mr. Crawford would like access to my client's files, they can make their allegations in a statement of claim. Councillors, do you have sufficient evidence at present to file a lawsuit against Matheson Steel? The barrels were removed from the field by a company contracted to Matheson Steel at the direction of Ben Matheson. - I was doing my civic duty. - Soil samples taken from the field show traces of contaminants including benzene, chlorine and methyl mercury. Chemicals don't have fingerprints, Your Honour. There's no way to trace them back to my client. Perhaps not. But this particular grouping of chemicals is consistent with the ones used in the manufacturing - of steel. - My own daughter is one of the girls with this illness. - If I thought for one second... - I represent the Matheson family in this matter. Ben's father Henry regrets that he's not able to attend, but on my client's behalf, I request that the motion be denied. Sustainable waste management is very costly. I imagine one could save upwards of hundreds of thousands of dollars taking that waste and dumping it oneself. Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Matheson? I'm sorry. This court denies your request. If you want to get to discovery, you need to file suit. - You're killing our jobs! - Our kids are getting sick! You're taking money out of our pockets! - Matheson, I hope you rot in jail! - Hey, go to hell! - That's enough, Jack. - Our kids are being poisoned! They're not poisoned, they did it to themselves! Probably some kind of drug overdose! Georgia's sick! She can barely get herself out of bed in the morning! This has nothing to do with the mill! It's the mill keeping this town alive! - Wendy... - You made your own daughter sick. - Hey! Get your hands off him! - I did not do this! Come on. Let's do this the right way. OK? - Easy, easy. Come on. - He's threatening me?! - Back up. Come on. - That's enough. - Molly! - Oh, Molly! Hey, you OK? Yeah. I just... I couldn't get out of the way. It was like my brain stopped talking to my body. It's OK. Let's get you out of here. Where's Luna? She said she'd be here. She's not answering my texts. Do you really think we can beat them? - Yeah. - Then I'll do it. I'll be your named plaintiff. - Are you sure? - Yeah. I'm so sick of feeling powerless. Hiding the car keys? Real mature. There was a thing at the courthouse that you just made me miss! My car, my call. There's no way I'm missing Kookum's birthday too. What did I say, Luna?! I don't care! I'll find a ride. The whole family is gonna be there and we never get to see them. I don't want you hanging out with them! You don't know what it was like for me there. - How they treated me. - It's ancient history, Mom. They're different now. People don't change, Luna. My boss is gonna fire me! "Your boss"? She's not sticking around, you know. She's gonna leave you high and dry. But you don't even know her! Oh, I know her type. OK. Listen. Just come with me. I'm sure Kookum wants you there. If she'd have wanted me there, she would have asked me herself. Matheson's trying to bait us into filing suit. They're hiding something. No, they just know we don't have anything. Yet. Whoever ran us off the road clearly wants us to stop digging. Yeah, we made someone nervous. So we find who was driving the truck, we find that someone. Thank you for coming. What's he doing here? Millwood is my town, and I won't see it rip itself apart. We're capable of sorting out our differences on our own. Ben has something he'd like to say to the two of you. - Ben. - I'm gonna pay to clean up the athletic field. Not the company. Me, personally. Is that an admission of guilt? No. I can't have people thinking that I did this. This is my home. We all know how important the mill is. The city accepts. - What is the offer, exactly? - He's going to clean the field. In exchange for what? You're gonna drop all this nonsense. Drop the case? - That's right. - It's time to move on. Hey. That was pretty crazy today. You OK? Yeah, I can take a hit. What's good? Everything. I just wanted to see if you were all right. I'm good. Maybe you shouldn't be back at work already. Well, that's not how jobs work. I haven't been back here in forever. Not fancy enough for the Mathesons anymore? Are you mad at me? You were on the wrong side today. My dad didn't do this. I'm sick too! Dude, we stood there and watched them pull barrels out of the field! That doesn't prove anything. Whatever. Everyone knows he's guilty anyway. He's not! So tell your uncle to stop spreading lies. Hi, Miss Evans. I called for a pickup. Two orders of chicken fingers. One day, when all this is behind you, you'll both have kids and you'll both be too tired to do anything but bring home takeout chicken fingers. It's nice to see you back at work. No one else knows what you're going through. No matter what, you're in this together. - Hey. - Hey. I had a chat with Pat Collins. Still workin' off a cheat sheet, huh? - Just like high school. - Huh. Captain of the hockey team teasing the slightly chubby A.V. nerd, - exactly like high school. - Come on, you weren't that fat. Oh, watch it, Crawford. I grew into my chubbiness. What did Pat Collins have to say? Well, his alibi for the night you were run off the road checks out, and he has a receipt for the sale of the truck to this place. Let's see if it's legit. Hey. You the owner? Russ... You guys here about the truck? Wondered if we could take a look at your records, ensure that the vehicle in question was scrapped. Too good to get rid of. Figured I'd fix her up. She's out back. Quite the collection you've got. Aw, man! It was right here! When was the last time you saw the vehicle? Days... A week, maybe. You don't lock the yard up after hours? Never had to. Not 'til now. Now what? Apology pizza? Does it come with apology garlic fingers? I wish. Luna, you can't just disappear on me like that. I know. I'm sorry. Molly's pissed at me too. Where were you? My mom hid the car keys. Did she hide your cell phone too? Usually she has a freak out, I ride it out and it passes. You missed our motion hearing. I know. I wanted to be there. Did we win? No, we didn't. What was the fight about? It's my kookum's birthday tomorrow. My mom and her don't get along, so apparently we aren't going. Sounds like your family loves Mother's Day about as much as I do. Does she live in town? Long Grass First Nation. Why are we looking at partnerships from 20 years ago? Well, because our hydrologist thinks that's when the barrels were buried. We need to find evidence that links the barrels to the mill. - You just need a lift out there? - Yeah. I can drive you. Are you serious? Yeah. We can work in the car. Yeah. Of course. So... why partnerships? I want to find everybody that Matheson Steel has worked with. Ben Matheson's dad Henry was in charge then, so keep an eye out for that name also. On it. Why is my gut still telling me it was Pat Collins driving that truck? It could be the wings. Collins was home with his wife, Brandy. She confirmed it. Doesn't he have a record for domestic assault? So he threatens to get rough, she's gonna say whatever he wants her to say. She does have a part-time job at the mill. That guy's not gonna run somebody off the road to save his girl's part-time job. What about his brother? - Tim? - He's a foreman at the mill. And he's got three kids. You got a spare key to your car? - Yeah. - Me too. So you sell your truck to a place you know you'd have access to it afterward, give the spare key to your brother, he steals it. Nah. Collins doesn't strike me as the type to be smart enough to cook up a plan like that. Ben might be, though. I know you don't want to entertain it, but... He coached my high school hockey team. He was a master of intimidation on the ice. May be time to have a chat with Tim Collins. I'll talk to Ben. One-on-one. No lawyers. - Uh... - You know what I mean. Just don't go in with any bias, first rule of interrogation. I'm just gonna talk to the guy. Hey. I need your help. And a good morning to you too. Old barrels were found in the athletic field. Finger's pointing to Matheson Steel. The firm said "no" on this, Joanna. I'm not asking the firm. I'm asking you. How well did you know Henry Matheson? Not well. We golfed together a few times. Has the plant ever had a spill or an accident? That's not exactly the kind of thing you talk about in the clubhouse. But I'll tell you one thing. The Matheson family singlehandedly saved that town. You always say "I'll tell you one thing" when you're holding something back. You're reading my tells now? I might've taught you too well. So what aren't you saying? When everyone else was outsourcing to cut down on labour costs, the Matheson family was the one that poured everything they had - back into that mill. - Until there was nothing left and they had to sell to PNL Steel. They could've cut corners trying to make the deal more attractive. Are you into your savings on this thing? No. I'm worried about you, Joanna. The partners are talking. You need to come back home. Not until I have a win. Is everything OK? Yeah. Still need a lift to the reserve? You mind if we stop at my house first? I need to get something. Where have you been? I was working. I texted you. Guess this means you're going. - She's my grandmother. - Who's driving you? - Your boss? - What do you have against her? She's driving me to Kookum's birthday party. - It's not a big deal. - If you take her to that party, it's not gonna end well. She's not one of us. And I'm not gonna be responsible for the storm she brings! Oh, you wanna act like I'm not your mother? Go ahead. She can have the job. It's all hers. Damn it. So, basically what I'm saying is that it's a deadlock until we file our statement of claim against the company. They're either gonna... wanna settle or drown us in paperwork, but it's the only way for us to move forward. - Luna? - Yeah, sorry. What? You've obviously got something on your mind. I'm a good listener. Lawyer-client privilege and all that. It's exhausting. What is? Trying to take the high road all the time. Yeah, well, you're gonna have to stop doing that if you wanna be a lawyer. It was always the high road with my mom. She really liked rules. And she wasn't great with affection. Definitely not maternal. Maybe that's why she left. My dad left too. He left before the pee was even dry on the stick. My mom was so young, you know? It's just been hard. I bet. Yeah. What's your dad like? He's great... most of the time, you know, when he's... not trying to out-manoeuvre me. The problem is I know all his tells. - Tells? - These things he does that let me know when he's being less than honest. Like what? I don't know, like he... yawns before he says something. "What'd you get up to last night, Dad?" "Oh, you know, I just had a few drinks at the club." Or "I'll tell you one thing." - That's another classic. - Nice. I'm gonna start looking for Molly's tells. And yours. Oh, God. I've created a monster. So, what? Are you stalking me now? No. I wanted to say something. It just took me a while to figure it out. - I'm not apologizing. - Well, that was worth the wait. - Look, we're sick. - Yeah, thanks to your dad! We don't know that. But whatever this turns out to be, it doesn't change the fact that we both have it. And Miss Evans was right. At the end of the day, this is who we are. It doesn't matter how we got here. Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night. - Scared? - No. I had to pee. And so I got up, opened the bathroom door and twitched, whacked myself in the head and nearly knocked myself out. Put me back on the field, Coach! I think I'm ready! - Ugh, that's terrible. - Yeah. Let's go. Last week, I, um, I tried to make spaghetti sauce. I got it everywhere. It looked like Saw 3D in my kitchen. - Oh, my God. - If I hear my mom say "you're gonna be fine" just one more time... Yeah, I know. Or "get well soon." Like you can just sleep it off like it's some bad cold. - Wouldn't that be nice. - Yeah. Look, like me or not, we're in this together. I can't wait for them to meet you. - Kookum! - Luna! - Happy birthday! - Would you look who it is! Joanna, this is my cousin, Susan. Kookum. This is my boss. Joanna Hanley. Where's your mom? She had one of her migraines, but she sends her love. It's a really beautiful spot you guys have out here. Joanna's been teaching me all about environmental law. Yes, she is a very smart young woman. Um... I should probably get back to work. Stay... There's lots of food. Right, Kookum? You're too thin, Luna. Has your mother been feeding you? She still on those night shifts? She works hard and we take care of each other. Don't mind her. She's just getting old. I'm just gonna go wash my hands. - Kitchen's just inside the front door. - Thank you. My granddaughter seems quite taken with you. She's pretty special. An activist at heart, I think. Always had an opinion, just like her mother. Her first word was "no." Well, I look forward to meeting her. How is it that Luna came to work for you? She wanted to help out her friend, Molly. She's also been a big help on the case. Your idea? All Luna. We appreciate you bringing her out, but it may be best if you got going. Not everyone here takes to outsiders. Yeah... of course. Ben. Thank you for agreeing to meet me. I would've ordered a pitcher but I didn't know what the legal ramifications would be. - Look, I'm here as a friend. - Come on, man. What you're accusing me of? Friends don't do that. I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm just here to talk. So talk. Luna, I got a call. It's work. I've gotta go. Do you want me to come back and pick you up? We'll make sure she gets home. Thanks for bringing me. And call me if you need me. She can manage a day without you. - Bye. - Bye. I'm not saying you knew about the barrels. The Crawford I knew, the Crawford I coached, that guy's not sitting right across from me right now, slinging this bile. All I'm asking is, is it possible that this happened before your time? So you're blaming my dad now? I'm not blaming anyone. I'm asking. As a friend. Believe it or not, I am trying to protect you. Environmental laws back then, they weren't what they are today. You come after anyone in my family, you're coming after me. I paid for the barrel extraction, Billy. I did that. No one else. That doesn't preclude the fact that the chemicals line up with the mill. - Ugh! Come on! - Ben. Ben! You are talking about my daughter, here. And your niece! - That's why this is so hard. - Not to mention my crew. Do you think that I would knowingly hurt them? I would do anything for those guys! Anything? What's that supposed to mean, Billy? You hear about that truck that ran us off the road? So, what? You're accusing me of that now, too? You are. People are scared of losing their jobs. I get that. Tim Collins, he would do anything to support his family. What's Tim got to do with any of this? I hope nothing, but Beckbie is over there right now. Is it possible the barrels fell off a truck? That there was some kind of accident? You are way out of line. Something happened here, Ben. You cannot just bury your head in the sand. Screw you, Crawford. We're done. What are you doing here? So this is where you've been working, huh? I wrote the statement of claim. We're making a case against Matheson Steel. When you decide to do something, you go all the way. The problem is you don't know when to let go. Seriously, why are you here? Because you sounded crazy on the phone. A male partner does this and he's showing initiative. A female does the exact same thing and she's "crazy." Give me a break, Joanna. There were barrels in the ground! This is how I work. It's not as insane as it looks. Let me prove it to you. I get it. It's tragic, but it's not your job to fix it. These people are counting on me. You can't file a lawsuit on a hunch. You know that. I know that if I can figure out how they got in there, I can find a direct link to the mill. Sweetheart, emotions cloud your judgment. It affects your choices. Why did you lie to me about Mom? Ahem. Um... I was just trying to protect you. She was growing more and more withdrawn by the day. I was afraid of what that might do to you in the long run. She needed help. And I did my best, but... I failed her. Maybe I failed you too, so... No, Dad. You didn't fail me. I'm fine. Look, even if the mill did all this, it was decades ago. These cases are so difficult to prove. Sweetheart, you did everything right. Matheson offered to clean up. That's a win. A big one! I'm proud of you, and I want you back on my team. Let the Crawford kid write the wills for this... dying town. So when can I expect you back at the office? I have a few things I have to wrap up first. OK. Yes. OK. That's my girl. Kookum sent you a pie. Everybody asked about you. I told them you had a migraine. Mom? Do you want some pie? No, I don't want pie. But it doesn't seem to matter what I want. You're gonna go and do whatever you want. That's not true. What if I said I don't want you working for her anymore? Hmm? You wanna work? I'll get you a job at the mill. There's an opening for a night cleaner. I don't wanna work at the mill. That mill has put dinner on this table your whole life! Yeah, I'm not saying that it hasn't! Oh, so she comes to town and now you're too good for it? - She's messing with us, Luna! - How? You know what? Forget it. I'll take care of this myself. What are you talking about? Mom! Where are you going? Where've you been? I've been calling you. Yeah, my phone was off. I was with my dad. - Your dad? - Yeah. I'm going home. It's over, Billy. We might as well take Ben's offer. I wrote the statement of claim, in case you run out of toilet paper. I don't buy it. You were so sure. You convinced me. We both saw those barrels being pulled from the field. We can't link those barrels to the mill. We have the chemical profile! It's not enough. The guy who ran us off the road? He works for Ben. Beckbie arrested him. No. A threat isn't proof of anything. Joanna, the girls need you. - We can't with this without you. - But there's nothing to win. You heard the mayor. She wants to take Ben's offer. That's the best we're gonna get. This isn't over, - not by a long shot. - Billy... You must be her. Can't say I see the resemblance. I'm sorry. Do we know each other? No, but I know your dad. Gerrilyn. What're you doing here? You're Luna's mom. - Is she OK? - She's fine. Heard you took her to my mother's. Yeah... It seemed very important to her. So you met the whole family. They, uh, nice to you? 'Cause we're not on the best of terms. Gerrilyn, is there something we can do for you? I don't want Luna working for you anymore. You need to stay away from her! And you can tell him it's too little, too late. He can't get to her through you. Who are you talking about? My mom didn't tell you? Tell me what? That kid you were driving around? She's your sister. What are you talking about? I'm surprised he's never mentioned us. He talked about you all the time. OK. I think it's time for you to go. She's the one who should go! - Hey. Come on. That's enough. - Nobody wants you here. Luna is mine. You stay the hell away from us. Could it be true? No. He never mentioned Gerrilyn? - Or another woman? - No. Why would she make it up? I don't know. Could this have something to do with your mom being in the hospital? It's just he lied about that. Joanna... Whoa. Sweetheart, what's wrong? - Tell me it isn't true. - Tell you what's not true? What year was Mom hospitalized? I told you not to go waking up ghosts. Oh, my God. She's my age. Who's your age? Joanna, you're not making any sense. Gerrilyn Spence. Let's talk outside. OK. What have you heard? That I have a sister, apparently. That's ridiculous. So you're telling me it isn't true? It's a vicious rumour. And you've been working way too hard, and if you weren't so consumed by this case, you'd know better. Yeah? Of course. Honey, it's ludicrous. Surely you see that. Why would she lie to me? Because she's... she's looking for a quick payday. Gerrilyn Spence is a liar. She's crazy. "Crazy." Crazy like Mom was crazy? Hey... Sweetheart. Hey. I want you to come home with me. Right now. Come on. Come home with me. I can't. Yes, you can. No, I can't.
