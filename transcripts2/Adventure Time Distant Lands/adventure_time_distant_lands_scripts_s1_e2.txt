 - I was... - Reading. - Book-lovin' Glassboy. - Bibliophile! Doesn't everything you read just leak outta ya? That was a good one. Okay, lights! Back in the old days... the wasteland desert was struck with a bolt of magic lightning. Kra-kow! And thus was born our glorious Glass Kingdom. And for hundreds of years, things were cool. Until from deep within the ancient furnace rose the dragon Molto Larvo! Ohhhh! Larvo's fire gunked up our entire kingdom.

 It was real bad times all 'round. But the Lightning Lord above saw our trouble and sent us... - a hero. - Marceline! Yes. Brave St. Marceline came to our aid. With her silver shovel and a holy song, she cast Larvo back into the depths of the pit. And once a year, we gather to sing her holy song to keep the monster locked up in the furnace. But... what if Marceline slayed Larvo? He hasn't been seen since that day. We don't have to be afraid of the furnace anymore. - What? - What are you talking about? I read about it in this ancient book. The furnace used to fix people. Broken people... like me. Don't kid yourself, crack face. I like the way you are. Yeah, you have a great "personality." He does.

I guess I have been going for a new sound this time. I really wanna get it right. Can I hear it? Uhh... alright. ♪♪ Okay! Nope! No! It's not done yet. Hey, it's alright. I can't wait to hear it when it's ready. I can't believe it. Why would you release Glassboy?! We need St. Marceline. Glassboy knows more about her than anyone. Glassboy is a fool. He'll take one step outside and get his gross crack stuck in his own foot. He would! I know. That's why I said it. I just... It's my right, y'know. Perhaps you should step down? - No! - He'll find Marceline! Okay, but he's probably already dead. - Hmph! - Princess! - Princess! - Wait! We have more excellent advice! Marceline... ♪♪ Mm. Huh? Aah! Who are you? Good evening. And how you been? Are you the chump with dry skin? No. I'm looking for Marceline. Oh, quack! A boy with a head crack. Hey! Marceline, Marceline. The Vampire Queen!

I know. Hey, why are we going this way? Because it's the fastest route. Why do you ask? Nothing. It's just... I used to live around here. What?! Really? When was this?

It's just as beautiful as I remember it. The great ceremonial glass doorbell! I love ceremony. First, approach the bell quietly and give it a single strike. And now for the best part! The welcome bowl! Mmm! Sand. I was thinking, if we have some time left over after you defeat the dragon, then maybe... Hey, Peebs, can we get this over with? No visitors. We're in a state of emergency. Yes! And we're here to help... Do you have a royal invitation? Well, not officially, but... No invite, no entry. Get lost, pinky! Okay, that's it. Actually, someone probably remembers me. Aaahhh! The great bell! Vandals! When the other shards get here, they're gonna chiiiiiiip yoooouuuu uuupppppp. - How rude. - Oh. Where's the dragon? Be cool.

Into our perfect civilization. Shards! Take him back to the tower, you guys. It's Marceline! The real Marceline! Bah! This could be any run-of-the-mill cave hag. Why should we believe you even? Marceline... What?! Huh! Marcy! Heh heh. They're jellybeans. It's not gross. Rrrrrrgghhh! Alright, whoever you are. Let's play. Ahh! Dang. Hey! Get back here! Rrrahh! Why ya hidin', bro? Oh. Aah! Oh, no! St. Marceline! Whoa! Sound waves? Hey, Marceline! Turn up the reverb! Whew. Marceline! Marceline! Marceline! Marceline! Bleh-heh-heh-heh! Oh, yeah! Oh, my gosh, she is so dope. Marceline!

Listen, Bonnie... you know all that stuff I said... Oh, I get it now! That song's about her, isn't it? Of course. It's not even subtle. Why didn't it work? It's been like a million years since that song worked. Mind if I try? What? The Morrow was following us with that the whole time? Peebs, were you... expecting me to fail? We never did figure out why your song worked in the first place. My next-gen barrier will buy me time to figure out Larvo's true weakness. The outsider's song just made the dragon angrier and sassier. What's your plan now? - Alright, um... - Marceline can do it. Tell them, Princess. Princess! Tell them! Tell them, Princess! Tell them! Put a cork in it, Glassboy! Please! Just get out of my face for five seconds! Ah! I got this. I got this. I got this. No. It has to be me. I'll write a new angrier song. ♪ The other day! ♪ ♪ You used my brush! ♪ ♪ It was okay, I... didn't... mind ♪ I'm just not that angry young punk anymore. It's like I don't even remember what it's like to be hurt and sad. Mm-hmm. No. It's still in me somewhere. I just have to go find it. "Go"? I have to go back. Back to the place where I was hurt the most. Marcy! This is a bad idea! That's it! That's the hat panda! Look, Mom! You're a regular cartographer, Marcy. We'll be at the secret clubhouse party in no time. Mom, will they have food there? Every party has food. All the good parties, anyway. Hey, let's play a game. I see... something that starts with an "S." Huh. Is it that scorpion? No. Is it that skeleton under the scorpion? Maybe we should play something el... Ooh! I see something that starts with a "P." Puppy! This puppy's funny-looking. Whazzaaap? Uhh! W'zup?! Whoa, mama. Bad doggy! Huah! Marceline! Mommy? Why are you looking at me like that? Whazzaaap?! ♪♪ Mmmmm-hooah! You're so competent. Yeah, I'm a pretty good stabber. Thanks for volunteering. The giant baster seems excessive. Check, check. Is this what passes for music in Cotton Candy Land or whatever? Wha... Wha... What's this, now? Look out! Aah! Eugh! You've gone warped, Princess. First Glassboy, then that fakey Marceline. Now you're putting faith in a princess even more helpless than you, okay? So either grow up or step aside. ♪♪ Oh, geez, oh, geez, oh, geez, ahh, geez. Don't worry, good people! I've got this under control. Just need a sec. Yo, Peebs, listen to this. ♪♪ Why are you acting like this? Oh, come on. You love it. They'll all be killed if I don't figure out how to defeat the dragon. They're made of glass. They break. Who cares? I do. They need me. Uh-huh. - ♪ Ah ♪ - ♪ Aah ♪ ♪ Aah, that hurts ♪ Stop it. I don't have time for you right now. Ugh! why are you being such a bummer? Could you just get out of my face for five seconds, you jerk?! If you didn't want me here, then why did you ask me?! I didn't! They called for me, and you tagged along. Go home. I honestly can't focus with you here acting like monster trash. Well... as long as we're being really honest... Come on. Come on, come on. Mom? Am I... a scary monster? Marcy, come here. Mommy! Hey, sweetie. I'm gonna fix this motorcycle up for us, but it's gonna take a while. Here's a special VIP card to get into the secret clubhouse. - What? - You're... You're gonna be late for the party. Follow the map. But I wanna stay with you. Marceline! I don't have time for you right now! ♪♪ Secret clubhouse! Boop! Hello? I see you. Party! ♪♪ I've figured out a way to stop Larvo for good. It'll be risky. Risky? I'm on thin ice as it is. I wish I could read lips. You're a princess. Yeah. Which means protecting your people no matter what. Even when your vampire girlfriend bails on you. Oh! We need a system to convey a butt-ton of liquid. But I don't have the resources here. My people can help. Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! I have a plan to defeat Larvo. Based on my research! And it's going to require all of us. What's with the touchy-feely inspirational jazz? Can it! I'm over you thimbleheads always chipping my cups.

"That was great." "Yeah. You're so good at music, Marceline." "Why is your mom scared of you? Where is she?" She saw what I did to the mean dog. Then she found a scooter, and... "That was her ticket out of town." "You scare everybody away, Marceline. Just like your dad." "Hey, Marcy did that on purpose." Like a funny joke." Yeah. That's right. When people get scared and run away, it's because I want them to! What's up, Lemmy? "Hey, dude." This thing always got on my nerves. One new message. Marceline... you're there, aren't you? Brave girl. I'm sorry I had to trick you. But you're tough enough to handle this world on your own. And it's not gonna change you because you have a good heart. I love you, Marceline. I hope you can forgive me. End of messages. Ugh. Mom... Mom? It's me, Glassboy! Ha ha! I heard something weird, so I came in. I wanna be alone right now! Please don't send me away. I-I'm just like you. You don't say.

Egress! Egress! - Bonnie! - Marceline! Glassboy. - Princess. - Quick! Get out your bass and start singing. My bass is smashed. Aaah! You loved that bass. Well, um... then your new song must be extra angry and sad. No. It feels more like... a wave of acceptance has washed over me. Nooooooo! Hey. I wrote a hateful song. ♪ See-Thru! I see right through... ♪ Look out! This thing really hates me. ♪♪ 'Scuse me. Whoo! It's me you want! Leave my princess alone! Aah! This is the last place the beast will... Huh?

Someone turned my forcefield on full blast! Uh, I think someone broke this. Bail? PB? Is he breathing? No. But that's okay. I don't think he breathes. We gotta find a way out of here. Aah, stop! The forefield has destabilized the entire chamber. Why did I even create a "full blast" setting? Live and learn. Hmm... This is pretty bad, huh? Yeah, pretty bad. Probably should've tried singing anyway. I was sorta hoping your song wouldn't work so I could finally show the Glass Kingdom how much of a scientific genius I am. Well, mission accomplished? I'm so sorry I left you alone on this. It's just... being back here where all this bad stuff happened... My mom and I didn't talk about bad stuff. When she got really sick, she didn't even tell me. She meant well, but I think it messed me up about being honest about my feelings. You and me are in a good place now. Well, not right now, obviously!
