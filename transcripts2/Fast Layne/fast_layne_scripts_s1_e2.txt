I have no idea. -Layne: DNA recognized? -(car computer beeping) How does this thing know my DNA? VIN: Who cares? We're connected! We can do a ton of cool stuff together. Like go driving... or go faster driving! This makes no sense.

 I wish my hand worked. Look at all this stuff it can do! Monster truck tires? Layne: Zora, don't! VIN: Whoa! My feet are huge! Let's go crush stuff! This is too weird. VIN: Hey! I was havin' fun! Really? You're just gonna leave? This is kinda your car. My car? I didn't ask for my hand print to activate a crazy talking car. So you're just gonna leave because you have flyers to print.? Yes, I've got flyers to print. And a life to get back to! One that doesn't involve high-speed car chases. VIN: Layne, you can't leave! We're connected! You gotta stay! Sorry, VIN... I should probably go with her. Aw! Not you too, Zor-Zora! Uh-oh... I don't feel so good.

I'm not here because I want to be, I'm here because I have to be. I'm here 'cause I wanna be. Puzzles, podcasts, books... if I start 'em, I finish 'em. Once, I missed my own sixth birthday to finish a game of Monopoly. VIN: Ohh! We're gonna play a game? (sighs) You're not listening. I'm here to figure out why you have my DNA so I can get back to my life. Zora: That's it?! You won the super-car lottery, and you're just gonna throw the ticket away? Exactly. VIN, tell me everything you know about the people who built you. Uh, like I said, it was a couple of dudes wearing goggles, lab coats... (gasps) Hold on... they had noses! Yes! Definitely noses! Does that help? Oh, totally. We're looking for "two dudes with noses." -Yep! -VIN, it was a joke. I love jokes! Let me play it again. Layne:  We're looking for  "two dudes with noses." (laughs) I don't get it. You have microphones. Yeah! So, that must mean you have cameras, too? Bumper cam, side cams, dash cam, I got all the cams. I record everything. Hi, Zora! Then there must be a clue in your video log to whoever built you. On it. Pulling it up. (security tape rewinds) Noses... those must be the dudes. I'm glitching, losing tertiary functions. VIN's losing his tushie functions! VIN: It's my ECU. Under my bumper. Careful, my rear-end's kinda hot. -VIN: Layne, how's it look? -Ehh... -Not good. -Ouchie... This is bad. My ECU runs a security check every day at 5 o'clock. If it's damaged, my memory gets wiped. I'll lose everything! Including your video logs. I'll never get to figure out who made him. And I'll have to wait till I'm 16 to get a car. Okay, here's what we gotta do. Remember Cody? That cute boy at the auto shop? I bet he can get us the part. We'll go first thing tomorrow morning. (laughs) -What? -You said, "cute boy." No, I didn't. I do not think he's cute. -That's not what I heard! -(record scratching) Layne: (remixed)  Cute boy, cute boy  cute boy, cute boy. You're so obnoxious. Layne: (remixed)  At the auto shop?  Cute boy, cute boy, cute boy,  at the auto shop? ♪ ♪ Morning, Aunt Betty. Uh, have you heard from my parents? They texted, they're in a seminar all day. Everything okay? Uh, yep, off to the library to study! On a Sunday? Get it, girl. (chuckles) Get it, girl! Ooh, before you go, try a fancy cheese ball. I think I finally found my calling. It's good! -Yeah? -Yeah! Don't forget your backpack. I didn't look through it. So great having you here. So... when exactly will you get home? Mel... do not go into my room. Oh, I wouldn't think of it. Have a great time at the library. Which is closed... on... Sunday. Layne: I, Layne Reed, lied about going to the library. I feel like a fugitive. I know... isn't this fun?! We should have code names. I'll be "Scorpion." And you can be... "Lady Snow Eagle." (scoffs) "Lady Snow Eagle"? VIN: Hey, Lady Snow Eagle! Little reminder, I only have six hours before my entire brain gets wiped. We know, VIN. We're on our way to get you fixed. VIN: Good, 'cause this is kind of your fault. My fault?! You're the one that tricked us into going on that joyride. VIN: And did you not have joy on that ride? No! No joy was had. I just wanna figure out this mystery, and go our separate ways. Ha! That's funny. 'Cause I just wanna figure out this mystery, and go our separate ways. Guys, chill. You fight like brother and sister. VIN and Layne: No, we don't. Alonzo:  Schedule alert. Pass out  campaign flyers  at rec center. Campaign? So, what're you running for? School president. Cool... I'm vice president of my school. Zora, you're homeschooled. It's just you. Why not be president? Too much pressure. VIN: Okay, then! Zora: So, who's your competition? Uh, you don't know him. It's this eighth-grader named Jasper Marr. Jasper?

I have a question, Jocko, sir! -(Jocko sighs) -You said a good survivalist "always has his radar up." Well, I've identified a suspicious person. Mel, we've been over this. That's not really a part of the training. Or what your mom paid for. I saw the subject in a futuristic-looking car yesterday. And then this morning she lied about going to the library. Okay. -Who's this person? -Mel: My cousin. Everyone thinks she's perfect, but I can finally prove she's not. I searched her premises. Jocko: So you... trashed her room? -Mel, that's not a good idea. -Mel: No kidding. I found nothing. So now, I need to know how to track her. All you need to track somebody is your cell phone. But I really don't think-- Cell phone! Thank you, sir!

(speaks Spanish) (speaks Spanish) Your grandpa seems mad. Nah, that's just how we talk. So, what'd you need? Mm-hm...

And where would we get hot air balloons? With the money we make from our t-shirt company. We have five hours. I've got it! My uncle's a Scamper driver. He makes tons of cash. We could totally do that. Where would we get a car? We are not doing that. ♪ ♪ And we're doing that. VIN: I can get paid to drive? Why did no one tell me this?! Okay, here's the deal. We're only gonna pick up people we know. But, they can't know it's us. VIN: Uh, whatever makes you happy. But we've gotta hurry if we're gonna fix my ECU.

Everyone needs to think you're a regular car, and that we're old enough to drive. (tires squeal) (car doors open) -(car doors close) -Ooh, stylish car. Thanks, this is a, uh, Scamper Deluxe. Sit back, and enjoy the ride. Hot towel, Doris? Don't mind if I do. I'll be here if you need anything. Tips are always appreciated. You look a little young to be driving. Oh, Doris, aren't you sweet?

We're gonna have to sell our blood. (electronic beeping) VIN: Listen, before my memory gets wiped, I wanna tell you something. I'm really glad I met you guys. Hanging with you has been the most fun I've ever had. I'm bummed I'm gonna forget it all. We're not giving up! We just... need to go faster. VIN: Really?!

He's gonna give us a terrible rating, but totally worth it. (chuckles) You know, Zora, you were right. Having a super-car kind of has its perks. Thanks, VIN. Sorry, what was that? I shorted out. I said thanks, VIN! Oh, I actually heard you. I just wanted to hear it again. (money stacking) (cha-ching) $18 left! One more fare should do it! VIN: Great! I totally got one more ride in me.
