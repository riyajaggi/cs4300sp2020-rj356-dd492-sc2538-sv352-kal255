 Zora: This is why they want VIN. To turn him into a weapon. VIN: Layne! These are the bad guys! This isn't over, Layne Reed. How does she know my name? (tires squeal) Mom! Dad... Cheryl: Okay, I'm just gonna ask it... how many times did you take Project VIN out? Six. Layne Weatherford Reed, I... I'm flabbergasted. Rob: For the record, I am double flabbergasted.

 -You could've gotten hurt. -Zora put you up to this, didn't she? No, no! We heard a noise... then, VIN tricked me into taking him out... the hand scanner recognized my DNA... I had to fix him... just kinda spiraled from there. I'm sorry. Where was Aunt Betty during all this? Making cheese balls? Betty... Layne: She doesn't know anything. I promise. Honey... the reason we're so concerned is because Project VIN is-- Classified! I know. I saw your holograms. I know everything. And I get why you didn't tell me about VIN. You're top-secret government scientists! -Whoa, oh-- -Sh-sh-shh. Oh-- oh, sorry. (whispering) Top-secret government scientists! Layne, if anybody finds out what we do, it could be... dangerous. And that's why there's something I need to tell you. -Oh, no. -There's some bad people after VIN. Bad people? This scary lady, and this... big, ugly gentleman. Maybe we should call the FBI. -Whoa! -Layne, a lot of people would love to get their hands on Project VIN, okay? We'll handle it. So, uh, am I in trouble? Yes. No-- I-- -I mean, is she in trouble? -There were extenuating circumstances. Cheryl: And that hand scanner was only supposed to work for us. (sighs) I mean, thankfully, no one was hurt. I guess we should all feel lucky. Okay, um... I'm gonna go tell VIN. -He's probably really worried. -Sweetie, uh, Project VIN is our concern now. Yeah, Mom's right, we've got work to do. You know, tests, protocols to run. It's probably best if you stay away from him for a while. And you can refocus. Don't you have the big vote dance coming up? -Right. -Cheryl: Yeah! Hey, um... VIN's not in trouble, right? I mean, he's gonna be okay? Oh, of course. Cool. (dramatic music) -We don't know that. -I know.

It is five A.M. ♪ ♪ Rob:  Back to the old routine. -Isn't it nice? -Yeah. Oh, I had some thoughts for your dress. -Dress? -For the dance tomorrow. It's blue. Cute, but presidential Right. Thanks, Mom. Oh! I don't know if you've heard, but I'm Layne's best friend. So there's a good chance we'll be seeing a lot of each other. -Okay... -So, I brought you a gift. Oh... it's a pickle. Exactly! How very thoughtful. Bye, Mom, bye, Dad. -Bye, honey. -Bye. Have you been out to the shed? Your parents put a padlock on the door. Really? Yeah, it's a big old honker. Well... my parents said they want me to stop spending time with VIN and "refocus." I gotta practice my Russian vocab. Then, do a report. On something... So... I guess I'll see you around? Yeah... (door closes) Zora: They're wearing lab coats? This is too weird. Cheryl: Okay, Project VIN. Time to run your diagnostics. (sarcastically) Ooh, diagnostics. Great. I've been soooo looking forward to this. That's sarcasm. -Yeah. -We didn't program that. I learned it from Layne. She's taught me a lot of things. Layne's a pretty cool sister. -Sister? -Yeah! You made Layne, you made me. Boom! Makes you guys my 'rents. You know, 'rents. It's what kids call their parents. (whispering) Honey, I think Project VIN's developed some sort of symbiotic relationship with Layne. (whispering) He's evolving faster than we thought. (whispering): Oooh, look at us... we like to whisper... Can we un-program the sarcasm? I hope so. ♪ ♪ Mr. Morris: Squirrel? Belka. (chuckles) Nailed it. One point. ♪ ♪ -Penguin? -Pengven. Oh! Close. It's penj-VIN. You really gotta hit the "VIN." Right... -VIN. Oh! -Consolation grape! Z, come on, keep your head in the game. I'm sorry, Daddy-o. Just kinda had a freaky moment, like déjà vu? But way more "vu." You ever get those? Yeah. All the time, Z-bear. All the time. ♪ ♪ (car engine revs, tires squeal) -Mrs. Dunkle: Uh, Layne? -Yes? This is French class. Francais! Not math. -Sorry. -(students snicker) Got a lot on my mind. ♪ ♪ They locked up VIN? So you can't see him? Yeah. And... he's a car and I miss him. Weird, right? Well maybe just talk to your parents about it. You know, when I get into it with my abuelo , we just talk about things, and it solves a lot of problems. Yeah, well... my relationship with my parents isn't really like that. If you say so. Oh, hey! Uh, see you at the dance tonight. You know what I don't get? This. "No Surprises"? You're full of surprises! Vote Layne Reed. She's actually full of surprises. I'll take a couple of these. Cody: Yo, Reed! Talk to your parents. Vote Layne Reed! Full of surprises! Vote Layne Reed!

VIN: How 'bout this?! Yeah! (stammering) VIN: Puttin' on a show for my 'rents! -Whoa! -VIN: So, how'd I do? What in the world was that?! Pretty cool, huh? Layne taught it to me. VIN: (gasps) Oops. I shouldn't have said that, I wouldn't want her to get in trouble. Compassion... his ability to mimic human emotions is remarkable. -(cellphone ringing) -Rob: Oh. -It's Colonel Hardy. You take it, he likes you. -(stammering) Colonel Hardy. I-- yes, good afternoon, sir. Ye-- we were just about to send you more findings on Project VIN and I-- You're calling a Code Orange?! No, I-- Ah, hi, excuse me, Rob Reed here. Listen, I feel strongly that a Code Orange is premature-- (gasps quietly) Code Orange? What's that?! No need to yell, we will have him ready by tomorrow. -No! -He's yelling! Rob: So, explain this to me again. Is this a vote or a dance? Well, Layne's principal wanted to increase voter turnout, so he combined the election with a dance. -Oh, isn't that clever. -Cheryl: Yeah! It's a vote-dance. (chuckling) I would've went to way more dances. Guys... let's talk. Really talk. About VIN. Rob: Uh-- Betty's cheese balls... -sure are delish. -I-I think there's Gouda in there. They're gorgeous! I think she's really found her calling. I know what you're doing. You're changing the subject. But I would really like to see him. Sweetie, he's classified. -Not to me. -The truth is, Project VIN is off limits. "Off limits"?! -For how long? -Indefinitely. You were never supposed to find Project VIN in the first place. Well, guess what? I did. And! It's "VIN." (chuckles) Okay, honey. We were the ones who built him, so... we know who he is. Clearly, you don't. Layne, I don't like your tone. Fine. Then I'll take my tone, and my dinner, up to my room. You can't keep him from me. Forgot my napkin. (stomps away) That's different. (sighs) -Alonzo, call VIN. -Alonzo: (beeping) Calling VIN. -(car phone rings) -Layne, finally! I've been trying to get a hold of you, but the 'rents blocked my outgoing calls. -Are you okay? -No! I'm wigging out! I overheard our parents talking about -something called Code Orange. -What's "Code Orange"? I don't know, but it's happening tomorrow! We gotta find out what it is! (clears throat) Layne: Uh... yeah, Aunt Betty, you left your cheese scooper in the bathroom, -and... -VIN: (whispering) They're in your room, aren't they? Yes, we are.

Hold up! Now she's signaling someone. (gasps) Ohh, this is gettin' good! (struggling) Uh, Zora? Ouch! -It-- (grunts) -My toes are tinglin'. Layne: (gasps) She's writing something down!
