 And the pathologist's report. I requested it ten years ago. Well, I'm here to tell you he's very much alive. Some old video footage from the early '80s.

 Some didn't wear bras or shave their legs. Your mum thought she could teach them something, But they didn't want to learn. There's your dad. No, that's not dad. He was a foot taller than mum. There was a lot of partying in those days. The road to town was bad, sometimes impassable. There was a bit of mucking around. Whether you like it or not, this is where it all began for you. With my seed. It was all secret. There was a few tears from her, And then, lo and behold, all these years later, here you are. All grown up. Kind of puts a different light on things, doesn't it? No, it doesn't. I loved my father and he drowned. You're my seed, girl. My blood. I knew it. What the fuck did he say? What happened? You're my brother. My half-brother. No, he's lying. This is one of his fuckin' set-ups. He showed me video footage of him and my mother. He said they had an affair. Hello, brother. You're freezing. I'm gonna go get you a towel. (sighing) Do you think it's harder than being gay? I'm telling you, he's fuckin' lying. You don't know what he's like. He's a pathological fuck. He's a fuckin' liar. Just do a dna test.

Simone has said she'll testify against him. I'm guessing that's his drug operation. She'll bring others. Narelle, sara, possibly. Certainly that has to be enough to get a search warrant for a raid, -But this time... -Hang on a second, I'll just get officer joy to listen to this. Why? Well, we're going to have to get somebody to take over the investigation. Zena, Can you get officer joy to come in, please? -Zena: Mm-hmm. -Thanks. -Why do you need him? -Well, he's going to help. How? Robin, you're matt's daughter. Your investigation is impeded By the fact that you're related. I've already had his lawyer on the phone to me. Ah, joy, come in. You can take over from detective griffin, please? I want to do it, al. Joy: Al, I'm on holiday tomorrow, sir. I'm going to wales. Ginny's parents have their Golden wedding celebration. Okay, um, well we can get somebody to cover for you. How long you away for? -Three weeks. -Uh, pete, Can you come over here, please? You can take over from, um, joy. -Eh? -This isn't going to work, al. Just give joy the contact addresses for simone and her friends, Then pete can follow up. Al, I've got that franklin situation. I'm just working it over right now. Al: Yeah, well you can do that after... Just leave the information on my desk. I'll get some legwork on it. -Seriously? -Yeah, well, we can prioritise it.

Put on your own mask first. How do I help myself? Why should I tell you when you don't listen? -I'm listening. -No! All you hear are your own crazy thoughts, Like a river of shit, on and on. See your thoughts for what they are. Stop your helping. Stop your planning. Give up! There's no way out. Not for others, not for you. We are living out here at the end of the road, The end of the earth in a place called paradise. How it going? Perfect? No. You are madder than ever. You are tired? So lie down right here. Be like a cat. Heal yourself. There is no match for the tremendous intelligence of the body. Rest. (sobbing) When is the next flight to reykjavik? Melissa: Um, iceland. Any route preference or carrier? No. Just get away from these crazy bitches. Get fucked! (helicopter whirring) Man: (over radio) I have a guy here on a bike heading into chinaman. Matt: Don't bother with him. Man: We're looking for smoke, yeah? Tui is way too clever to show any smoke so don't waste time looking for any. Just keep an eye on the huts. If you see her, move on like it's routine. Come again. Understood? Man: Copy that. Matt: Okay. (dog barks) Wham! Mark: Luke, grab that one. Luke! Dad.

Where is she, then? Where's simone? -Fuck knows. -She blames me. I know she blames me. And where's delia? Where's sara? Where are they, huh? Well, let me tell you this.

Matt's gone in after her. So could you come? Johnno: It's cold. Must have been here a while. -Is matt armed? -Yeah. Putty: Doesn't speak. Doesn't speak. Doesn't say anything.

It's all right. (johnno moans) # drag me down to the water # hold me down until I'm full # until I struggle no longer # until I've drowned in my sinful will # bound my hands to the stake # set fire to the ground below... # Watch him. Zena called. I thought you were asleep. Have the results come in? -From both the labs. -And is there a match? (whimpers) Johnno: Al wants to tell you himself. He coming out now. Bunny? I know. What's up? (faint music heard from headphones) Al: How many do you want to order? Daniel: How many are we allowed? Al: I think three. Tegan: Three? (indistinct conversations) Kayla: Oh, hey, tui. Tui: Hi. Kayla: Oh, my gosh! Oh, so cute! So tiny. That's yours? (giggles) Is there, um, somewhere we can talk? Ah, here's matt. Don't know what you've got planned for him, but here he is. How's tui going? Robin: Through the day, you wouldn't know anything was wrong. But, at night, she... She has terrible nightmares. We, uh, crosschecked the results with two labs because, ah... Quite frankly, I'm surprised and I'm sickened. Here we are. I'm still shaking my head because I can't really believe it. Matt's the father of tui's baby. For all his faults, I thought he had more decency. (baby crying) Shut up. What about the baby? Is the baby okay? Mmm, as far as I can see, yeah. Chromosomes are all normal. Al, how are we going to put her in court? She so confused. She doesn't even seem to know she shot matt. She talks as if he's still alive. She won't see a court, I can promise you that. Matt was pointing a gun at her baby, right? Yeah. Seems like your mother had her own midwinter madness. Matt's not your father, mate. (baby continues crying) He won't shut up! He crying over nothing. Right-o, baristas. Grad night. -Come on. -Kayla: Are you coming? You decided on the pizzas yet? Can tui come too? We all want to hang out. Uh, yeah, it's fine by me. Um, maybe ask robin though. Is it all right if tui comes? I want to go. You sure? Kayla: She can share my sleeping bag. It quite big. It opens out. Let her go. You'll call me if you change your mind? Get your mobile. Phone. I'll come and get you, okay? Al: Okay. So, what's the decision? (indistinct conversations) Tui: Wait. Bye, noah. Have fun! (honks horn) Tui: Bye. What is it? She needs to be a kid again. Just needs to be able to hang out with her friends. Perfectly normal. And we need to be normal. Or try to be normal. Or pretend to be normal. Come on, let's get out of here. You gonna talk to me here? You gonna pay me some attention? She has her phone. She'd call if she needed us. I'll call her, okay? You're apart from tui again. It feels traumatic. It's not surprising. Here you go. Tui: (recorded voice) hey, this is tui. I can't speak to you right now. Can you text me? -No answer? -I'll send a message. Excuse me, have you got tegan's number? Sure. -Thank you. -(baby crying) (phone dialling) April stephens was a graduate. The girl who was run over. I didn't know that. Johnno: Could you get the formula, please? Hey! Where are you going? It's okay. (shushes) (phone dialling) Tui: (recorded voice) hey, this is tui. I can't speak to you right now. Can you text me? Shit. (knocking) (banging on the door) Al: Oh, angel. Oh, I thought you'd never fucking come. -Kiss? Eh? -Hey, hey. Oh, okay. No kiss. I'm a bad boy! Bad boy. What do you want me to do? Hit the ground, put my hands in the air? Just stop it, al. I'm sorry. This is my night off. -I'm a bit loaded, that's all. -Where are they? -Hey? Who? -The kids. Thought my dvds were shit so they've gone into town to see a movie. They said they were going to call. Didn't they call? They've probably turned their phones off. Yeah. -Just give it a try. -Who you ringing? (phone ringing) Looks like she left it. I'll just go and get it. What took you so long? You know, the waiting has been fucking killing me. Al, I want the kids. Where are they? I told you, they're not here. I think you're lying. Oh, fuck, that... -Move aside. -Ooh, that's sexy, isn't it? -Step aside, al. -Big gun for a little girl. Al, I'll shoot you. I'm warning you. (laughs) go on. Wanna shoot me, yeah? Wanna shoot me, do ya? There. Put it there. Fuck, that feels good. Oh, that feels good, doesn't it? What are you here for? Yeah? What are you really here for, anyway? (gun fires) Jesus! (al moaning) Fuck. (mobile phone rings) Emergency. We need an ambulance. There's been a shooting. 50 lake drive. This is detective robin griffin. Tui, are you all right? You okay? -Why didn't you answer your phone? -I was sleeping. Where are the others? Where's tegan? Did they go to a movie? Tui, it's very important you tell me. Maybe. I don't know. You stay here, okay? -Stay here! -Why? (door opening) Man: Yeah. The flowers or the stripes? I don't mind, you choose. (classical music playing) Robin: Turn around! Put your hands behind your head. Do it now! (sirens approaching) (shushing) Shhh. It's okay. Gj! No goodbyes, thanks. Where are you going? I don't want you to go. You've got a real teacher now. Make sure you pay attention to him. (noah crying) Listen.
