 You know, sometimes, maybe once in your career a case comes along that Fits so tightly that you can't let go. You know? That's when things start to go crazy. You dream about it, you can't stop thinking about it and Everything around starts to be a sign. Why do you say that? Well, because I think that, um, Tui's case is triggering history in your life. I didn't run away from home. We got those lads, you know. Fifteen years ago we brought those little hard-ons in. It was right after you left for sydney with your mother. Now, a few of us, All the guys, matt mitcham included, we, um, Brought them in and worked them around, we stripped them and Gave them a hiding on their skinny little arses. You know, mitcham figured out that sarge was the dirty little start-up So he made him lick the other guys' arseholes. So does Everyone know? Does officer joy know? yeah. The whole police station? It wasn't your fault, you know. What happened should never have happened. We only did what we did because Your father wasn't around to teach those dirty little shits a lesson. Hey... Are you okay? Hey, I know this can't be easy for you. So everyone knows I've been raped. And those... Those arses are just... They're just walking about. No, they were bloody well punished. Yeah... And I had a baby. Oh, jesus, I didn't know that. How old were you? Just 16. Mum was catholic. Didn't have a choice. My girl wrote to me A few months ago. She wrote on pink notepaper With two doves in one corner. She really wanted to know a few things about her Biological parents. You know, like, were we into sport or Books Like her. What the fuck could I say? 'cause if I was her... If I was her and I found out That my father Was one of four rapists and My mother, Their 15-year-old victim. I would want to kill myself.

I've got some words for you, eh? There you go. Fuck off. I know you from somewhere, don't I? You're not a sydney girl? Hmm? Too classy for you to be a sydney girl. I reckon it's like a picnic races or something. You don't remember me, do you? Probably the royal easter show, I'm thinking. -no. -Yeah? Did we fuck or something? We fucking did, didn't we? -you remember me now, arsehole? You remember me now, arsehole? Do you remember me now?

Looks a bit rough. Al, I'm sorry. I lost it. It won't happen again. No, 'cause you're stood down. And who'll take over tui's case? She's dead. You put your finger out of the window lately? No one can survive out there in this cold. Go and get some sleep. And, uh, think about getting back to australia. An aggressive cop, and I'm talking grievous bodily harm, It's just not on. Where are you? Are you dead or alive? Hey. I've blown it. Al sacked me. And I'm single. -You're single? -Yeah. I'm not a detective and I'm not engaged. I'm so angry for her. Just lie low, and you'll see a lot about how this place operates. While there's nothing going on we can get to know each other. No impediments. It's pretty threatening. What is it? Kid. Which kid? I've been keeping an eye on these kids' canoes. Checking how often they go out. This means he's been out. The boy with the hoodie? Yeah. Watch your footprints. Hey, you're in this. Look, school camp. Oh, yeah, look at that. Hey, it's your little brother. His arm's all bandaged up. What's that? Shit, that's us. You want milk? Can you talk to my boy? Jamie. What about? He's not normal, he doesn't... He doesn't talk. He collects bones. He told me there're 206 in the human body. I'll leave you to it. Your mum says you won't speak to anyone. Should she worry? Sometimes when people are silent it's because They're afraid of what they might say. People can make mistakes, you know. They can lose their temper and do things they regret. Is this yours? It's wet. Have you been out on a kayak? How'd it get wet? You know, when very young girls get pregnant, it's often innocent. They've been with a boy and it's... They do things, things happen... It's an accident, it's not a crime. Was tui your girlfriend? You two ever fool around? You are friends. Jamie, I know that. I found your messages on her phone. I called your number. You know, jamie... You ought to know the police won't give up on a case like this. They're not allowed to give up. Wishbones. What do you like about bones? Oh, you're a barista. That's cool. Congratulations. Do you really believe in all that shit? Hey. You know that kid who doesn't speak to adults? He doesn't speak to anyone. I hear he's speaking to you. We were speaking with him. Hey, have you done the barista course? Have you done it? I'm doing it. Hug me. They slave us. They don't actually, they just make them work. -hey, simone's son, he collects bones. There's hundreds of them. And guess what? He's got a pale blue hoodie. And it was really wet. What? I just don't remember this being taken. Do you? It's not a good time. Mum made that dress. your mum. I remember her face falling when she opened the door to me. No, it was when she heard your name, And she realised you were matt's son. She hates him. She thought you would be just as bad. I remember that kiss. I do remember that. Where'd you go off to? Just didn't want you to know I smoked weed. You didn't come back. I had a lot. I was pretty stoned. You up for this? Not really. I was so hurt. So I decided to walk home. Didn't you see me? I came right after you. I was waving. I thought you saw. Hey, robin! I don't remember you waving. Then that truck pulled up out of nowhere. I didn't notice how many men were in the truck. And I didn't see how drunk they were. I tried to talk my way into the cab. They threw me in the dog cage on the back. You came, too? There's something I need to tell you. Is it bad? What is it? yeah, I think it's bad. You're scaring me. Don't tell me. Don't tell me! -Hi! Me. -You're late. I brought you dinner. That's nice. Hi. This guy's been ringing for you for a couple of days now. Says it's important that he talks to you. He's at the lakeside motel and he's come up specially to see you. -Who is he? -He wouldn't say. Does he know I'm not a cop any more? Why did I have to hear that from other people? Who told you? Al rang to see how you were going. I had no idea you were sacked. What's happening to you? I don't understand the behaviour. You're not violent. You're lucky al stepped in for you. He could've stepped in 15 years ago. Then what? A court case? Why not? It happens all the time. And you know what, I don't give a shit If sarge is walking around with a grubby bandage on. I hope he's awake and in fucking pain! Always! Me, too. Always. Don't go back to laketop. There's too much history for you there. It's destructive. Robin griffin. You are? Ian fellows, pathologist in macau. You got identification? Well, good point. Uh, a good point. Huh. Oh, I hear you're on loan from the new south wales crime squad. Who told you that? Your old boss. What's your opinion of the police here? I don't work for them any more. That's a side step. No, actually, it's a step down. Detective parker stood me down. really. Well, I can tell you from my experience, they're fucking pathetic. That's like a lost and found office, With al parker as head clerk. I suggested three cases Go forward to coronial inquiry. He hasn't moved on one of them. Bob platt, drowned in a boating incident. They call "accident". Wolfgang zanic, suicide with lacerations and bruises I can't make any sense of. And April stephens, 13, Hit by a car on laketop road. Traces of cocaine in her vagina. -When was she hit? -Oh, uh... Late last year, let me see. Uh, yeah, November 15. Cocaine? Where'd she get that? It's not a kid's drug. That's right, far too expensive. Was there any evidence of sexual intercourse? Slight vaginal abrasions, And no sperm. Probably used a condom. What are you thinking? Ah, queenstown is a millionaire's playground. What they want, they get. Top grade cocaine, prostitutes And I'm adding underage sex. When I have someone on my slab, They all just become, uh, decaying matter, evidence. But when a kid's involved, it's different. I had a daughter who overdosed. So for me, it's emotional. Did April have a habit? I don't think so, no. Her arms were clean. Apparently, she walked out in front of the car as if she wanted to be hit. Hug me.
