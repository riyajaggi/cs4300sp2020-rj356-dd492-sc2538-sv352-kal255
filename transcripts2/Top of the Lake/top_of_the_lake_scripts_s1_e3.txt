 We've identified a suspect. Who? You
know Zanic, the Austrian fella?
 He's a convicted paedophile.
 That's Tui. Yeah. Tui.
 Someone said they heard crying.
I need to look through the house.
 HE ROARS, GUNSHOT
 There's more here, and there's more
here. And it's not going away.
 You don't remember me?
 What's the past? It's history?
Leave it there.
 She's not here, lady.
That's for free.
 Who's signature is this?
It wasn't possible, mate.
 Hey, if you want to use the toilet,
you can use my en suite.
 Wolfie's hung himself. He left
a suicide note. What about Tui, Al?
 This programme contains some
violent scenes, very strong language
 and scenes which some viewers may
find disturbing.
 # I don't know why she's leaving
Or where she's gonna go
 # I guess she's got her reasons
But I just don't want to know
 # Cos for 24 years, I've
been living next door
 HE GRUNTS
# To Alice. #
 Why did he put the panties
on his head?
 Let's go.
SIRENS APPROACH
 Hey! Hey!
What are you doing here?
 Get off the path. He was helping me,
Detective Sergeant.
 Right. It's Sarge, isn't it?
Yeah.
 Well, get off the path, now. I
fucking found him down on the tree.
 You what?
You found him, did you? Yeah.
 On the tree with the
fucking undies on his head.
 Is that right? Yeah. Well,
you're a suspect.
 You're in a lot of trouble, son.
Howe, take him back to the car.
 Oh, a suspect?
What are you, Einstein?
 Just going to pick the
first bloke who shows up?
 Brilliant police work, that is. Hey!
Come on, Paul. Come on.
 Fuckin' arsehole!
 Robin?
 "I am sorry for what I done.
 "I sorry to mother who must
know I die happily in sleep."
 Died in your sleep.
 Howe!
 When's the photographer coming?
He's on his way, sir.
 Any sign of that girl? No.
 Detective sergeant.
 He's got a pile of video
equipment, sir.
 Any tapes?
Yeah, boxes of them.
 Now, you're OCCS tonight,
OK?
 Sir, I'll have nightmares. No, you
won't, you'll be awake.
 Sausage on the Barbie,
if you want.
 There's no need for an ESR.
It's pretty clear it's a suicide.
 Put those in the car, mate.
 Al.
 Tell me
it's too small for her.
 Pete, make a new perimeter,
and call the ESR.
 I want them here
as soon as they can.
 Tell the others it's a negative
on removing the male body.
 Don't cut him down.
Leave him up there.
GUNSHOTS
 Oi!
 There's a grave.
 We have to wait for forensics.
 Have you got company?
 No, not now.
 DOGS BARKING
 Tea? Wrapping paper. Do we have any
wrapping paper?
 Hello?
Yep, right down the bottom.
 BELL RINGS, DOGS BARK
 Dad, the girls are here.
 Right. Well, I want them
to finish those trimmings.
 There's a lamp at the
back. Tell them It needs fixed.
 And get them to clean
those beakers out, OK?
 Dad, should I let them in?
 They'd better not
fuck me about.
 Haven't got time
for it this morning.
 Morning.
 Narelle,
do we have any sugar?
 Straight downstairs.
Morning.
 Morning, Delia.
 Yeah, she got hit
by a fucking car.
 She's in the hospital, mate.
Not doing too good, either.
 He completely lost it.
He spent all the money.
 The deal we had is if it's not
paid for, it doesn't leave here.
 Cos otherwise what you're
asking me is to trust you.
 And all I can say to that is
you must be fucking joking me.
 Get the fucking money.
 A GRASS STRIMMER WHIRS
 Hi.
I was wondering if you'd, uh,
 Like these? No! No! No, no, no, no.
 So you want to come
have dinner with me?
 Yeah, why not?
 GUITAR MUSIC PLAYS
What's that, band practise?
 Oh, we have these meetings.
 Everyone's welcome, you know.
You can come if you want to.
 Is she going to be there?
Maybe.
 SHE SOBS
 Why are these people
closing their eyes?
 They're meditating, GJ.
 Wake up!
 I've got a question.
Is there such a thing
 as the human mind?
Human mind, wow.
 Is someone speaking?
 What is the nature
of the human mind?
 Plotting and scheming.
Planning and calculating.
 That is the nature of mind.
Constant thought.
 Recent research tells us that
the Universe is not infinite.
 so what I want to know is...
Who's this guy?
 Matt Mitcham, the girl's father.
Matt Mitcham.
 What I want to know is,
when you get
 to the edge of the Universe,
 What's there, hmm?
 Don't know.
Not going there any time soon.
 What do you see?
 Ask something
a little bit more personal.
 THIS is personal.
My guess?
 You're not going
to like it, mister.
 So what is it?
 What's beyond the void
that's so frightening?
 What's so scary?
 A lost little girl.
 Your girl, Mr Matt.
Your kid.
 With a secret growing inside.
 Would you call the photographer,
please?
 Where the bloody
hell's Lee?
 HOWE: They headed off
towards the lake.
 What? Well, get him immediately.
Taking a piss, sir.
 I don't care what he's
doing. Get him here now.
 Robin?
 All right, everyone. Mic on?
 Peeling back
the bloodstained towel.
 What the bloody
hell is that?
 Looks like an animal.
It's a dog.
 CAMERA CLICKS
 Robin? Go get four of the guys and
 check the property for any further
burials.
 You can go, um, 100 metres
beyond this boundary.
 You still think
he's done something?
 Well, his note said
he's sorry for something
 And I'm sure it's not for
euthanizing his dog.
 Come on, Al. Someone's
obviously been harassing him.
 Look at his house.
 What do you expect?
He was exposed.
 No wonder he hung himself.
 You might want to look at this.
Zanic's video.
 FOLK MUSIC PLAYS ON THE TAPE
Hey. Up.
 Can I have it?
'Ja! Ja, that is so good.'
 Does Wolfie have
a blue hoodie?
 Whoever shot this did.
Doesn't everyone have one?
 # Well, darling,
haven't you changed? #
 TUI CONTINUES TO SING ON THE TAPE
 Have you got kids?
 Can I be left alone, please?
 # A memory... #
 SHE WHISTLES
 SHE LISTENS TO THE RECORDING OF

 TUI CONTINUES TO SING
 # A memory... #
 KNOCK ON THE DOOR
 Uh, I've brought my Canadian.
You want to go out on the lake?
 All right.
 You know,
Tui sings really well.
 We should have
brought the wine.
 Be nice to have
a glass out here.
 Yeah, I don't drink. What about the
other night at the bar?
 No, that was a soft drink.
So you've no excuses.
 So...
 Are we going to do it again?
It's complicated.
 Don't you think?
 No.
 Going to fish?
 Can't we do a bit more
of the wrong thing
 Before we do the right thing?
 I found a place. There's this old
teak opium house.
 It's up near the
Thai-Cambodian border.
 And the rivers there run right
down out of the mountains,
 and there are these
small poppy plantations
 Scattered out there
through the rainforest.
 People there were
really good to me.
 But, after a time, I just became an
addict. Just a fucking arsehole.
 I ran out of money.
I ran away.
 They caught me trying
to get across the border.
 I got processed.
Ended up in this...
 This hell hole.
 Just concrete wall and floors, and
a hole in the ground for the toilet.
 Dad,
He just said, "stuff you."
 How many years was it?
It was eight.
 The last few there were a lot
easier. My mum,
 she really stepped up. She helped me
pay for food, medicine.
 I was able to study law.
 Shocked?
 No.
 What do you think?
 You know,
you were my first kiss.
 Was I yours?
First long kiss.
 Can I do this properly?
Like in bed?
 I don't know. I don't want to fall
for you.
 We can make it the last
time.
 Do you have to work
in the morning?
 Why? I want to go for coffee.
 No. No coffee.
 I'm about to get married.
I don't want to fall in love.
 Wear it.
 BLUES MUSIC PLAYS IN THE BACKGROUND
 Here.
 LOUD MUSIC CONTINUES IN THE
BACKGROUND
 Hey, turn the music down.
 Sara.
 Turn the fucking
music down!
 What is it?
 Oh, yeah.
 Fertiliser.
Awesome. I want some of that, eh.
 It's mephedrone, bro.
 Here. There you go. "Gives
three to four hours' stimulus,
 "Mild euphoria, enhanced
appreciation of music,
 "Some erotic overtones."
Who's this old fucker?
 Mate, that's Dr Shulgin.
Berkeley, California legend, OK?
 He discovered and experimented
with over 230 psychoactive drugs.
 Living legend.
 Good man.
Yeah, that's nice.
 That's nice.
Where'd the shit come from?
 It's good.
 You reckon the old man'll
go for it, Marky?
 Hey, just do a halvie ya, bro.
We'll be peeling you off the walls.
 Oh! What'd I just say?
I'll be all right, mate.
 THEY LAUGH
No, you won't, bro.
 No, you won't, bro.
 This is really good.
 THEY LAUGH
 ALL: No!
 My first date in years.
Uh, this is not a date.
 It's an apology. If I wanted a date,
I would have asked Bunny.
 OK, I'm...
I'm kind of confused.
 So how did Bunny
get in with that, uh...?
 GJ? GJ. GJ, yeah.
 Oh, they met in rehab. Who was in
rehab? GJ was in rehab?
 No, no, no, she was visiting
someone. Hmm.
 And they got talking.
Bunny said, "you're the first person
 "who's ever really spoken the truth.
 "wherever you want to go,
wherever you want to be,
 "I'll pay for it."
 GJ said, "let's see
if you really mean it."
 And she put her finger
on the map...
 like that.
 And now here we are, Paradise.
 She put her finger on a map?
 Yeah. Yeah.
Here we are.
 How are you handling Paradise?
 Beautiful. Yeah.
 Got quite a history, you know.
 No, I didn't know.
 Adam and Eve,
Garden of Eden.
 Hmm.
The coming of the serpent.
 Serpent. Wow. Right.
No, not me.
 No, not you.
No, the first guy that moved in
 there killed his wife and kids.
 Burned the house down.
 Next family, the silence nearly
drove them mad.
 Thought they could hear the
kids wailing through the walls.
 One day,
they just got up and left.
 Is it really true?
You should tell Bunny.
 I bet you Bob Platt didn't.
 Why don't you
tell her yourself? OK.
 So how do I get
a date with Bunny?
 I think it's time to go home.
To your place.
 That's what I want to do.
 You have some of that, eh, you'll
be fucked for work tomorrow.
 OK, don't talk to me unless you're
 going to keep to the present tense,
OK?
 Don't want to hear about anything
else. Just pisses me off.
 Just say
what's happening now, OK?
 Right now.
Whatever's happening now.
 Anything else, just keep to
yourself.
 I don't want to hear about
it.
 Here's Dad.
 Yeah, see, that's good.
Hey? Yeah, that's good, see?
 He's coming. He's right here.
 Hey, Dad!
 Dad.
 It's Luke!
Wonder where the fuck he's been.
 Well, see, that's not
what I want to know about.
 I don't want to know
where he's fucking been.
 Hey, hey, it's here.
 Here!
 Hi.
 What's the matter with him?
He's high.
 Living in the present. It's a
problem for some people.
 Hi.
 Was that the chimp lady?
 IS that the chimp lady? "IS".
 Jesus, you came prepared.
 Oh, yeah.
 Listen, Anita, there's a
confession I have to make.
 I can get hard,
OK?
 I CAN get hard.
I've got the chemicals.
 It's just the thing is...
 I need warning, OK?
 OK.
 Well,
 we don't need to
make love tonight.
 You're not disappointed?
 No.
 You sure?
Yeah, come on.
 Come on. I won't bite.
 My last wife was Thai.
 Thai, right.
 She was a good woman,
 apart from the fact
that she didn't love me.
 Yeah. Which I didn't think mattered,
but obviously it did.
 "Oh, Matthew,
 "You take too long,
you got no power."
 "You take too long, you got
no power."
 THEY LAUGH
 It wasn't funny at the time.
 Sorry.
 Let's just play together.
 Get to know each other.
 Touch.
 Cuddle.
 I bet you've never
been here before, huh?
 The arse end of Paradise.
I've NEVER been here.
 Hey, Luke gave me an E.
 Oh, did he now?
Yeah. Well, actually,
 He gave me two Es.
Do you want one?
 I've... I've taken mine.
 Come on. Come here.
 Come on.
 Give me your tongue.
 Come on.
 Oh, you're really beautiful.
 You're really...
Oh, God, you're really real.
 You're so beautiful.
 THEY GIGGLE
 Want to meet Mum?
 Your mum?
 You're beautiful.
 Mum...
 This is Anita.
 Anita, Mum.
 Hi, Mrs Mitcham.
 Fuck. Poor Mum.
 Once again,
where she doesn't belong.
 No. No, Matt, look. She's...
She's so at peace.
 Not with you fucking
standing on her, she's not.
 What?
Get the fuck off her!
 Oh. Get off her. Sorry.
 What the fuck
is wrong with you?
 I promise you...
 I will fix this.
 Oh!
 I promise you,
 you will rest
 in my land.
 On the hilltop, Mum.
 Hello?
Al, it's Robin.
 I think I've got it. I think I
understand what Tui meant.
 Can I drive over now?
No. Not now.
 Hey, what are you doing tomorrow?
How about Sunday dinner?
 Did you find
anything else at Zanic's?
 Just two dead sheep.
 Are you able to make it 7:30?
 Bye. Good night.
 May I take your coat?
I'll keep it on, thanks.
 Oh, you won't be cold,
I just lit the fire.
 I'll take it off later.
 I'm not really dressed for this.
There you are.
 Cheers. Cheers.
 I don't have any salad dressing.
Can you whip one up?
 OK.
 Do you have garlic?
 Yeah, got a lot of garlic.
 Shall I tell you what
I came up with last night?
 Yeah, sure.
 I'll just get these
out of the way.
 I'll fill your glass.
Thanks.
 I think I know what
Tui was trying to tell me.
 Look, I think she meant
literally "no, one".
 As in three or four.
 Not one, I think she was
 multiple raped.
 When you think of Tui,
what do you see?
 SHE SIGHS
 A very lonely,
frightened little girl.
 Why?
 What do you see?
Well, yeah, I see that, but
 I'm looking at that frightened,
lonely little girl.
 You know, sometimes, maybe once in
your career a case comes along that
 fits so tightly that you
can't let go.
 You know? That's when things
start to go crazy.
 You dream about it, you can't stop
thinking about it and
 Everything around
starts to be a sign.
 Why do you say that?
 Well, because I
think that, um,
 Tui's case is triggering
history in your life.
 I didn't run away from home.
 We got those lads, you know.
 15 years ago we brought
those little hard-ons in.
 It was right after you left
for Sydney with your mother.
 Now, a few of us,
 older guys, Matt Mitcham included,
we, um,
 brought them in and whacked them
around, we stripped them and
 gave them a hiding
on their skinny little arses.
 You know, Mitcham figured out
 that Sarge was the dirty little
start-up
 So he made him lick
the other guys' arseholes.
 So does everyone know?
 Does Officer Joy know?
 (SOFTLY) Yeah.
 The whole police station?
 It wasn't your fault, you know. What
happened should never have happened.
 We only did
what we did because
 your father wasn't around to teach
those dirty little shits a lesson.
 Hey...
 Are you OK?
 Hey, I know this
can't be easy for you.
 So everyone knows
I've been raped.
 And those...
Those arses are just...
 They're just walking about.
 No, they were
bloody well punished.
 Yeah...
 And I had a baby.
 Oh, Jesus, I didn't know that.
How old were you?
 Just 16.
 Mum was Catholic.
 Didn't have a choice.
 My girl wrote to me
a few months ago.
 She wrote on pink notepaper
with two doves in one corner.
 She really wanted to know
a few things about her
 biological parents.
 You know, like,
were we into sport or
 books like her.
 What the fuck could I say?
 Cos if I was her...
 If I was her and I found out
 that my father
 was one of four rapists and
my mother,
 their 15-year-old victim...
 I would want to kill myself.
 I would want to blow
my fucking brains out.
 And that she doesn't know.
 Never has to know.
 That's it.
 That's all I have to give her.
 Every birthday,
 every Christmas...
 Her fucking right
to innocence.
 Fuck the truth, Al.
 SHE CHUCKLES
 Fuck the truth.
 Was Johnno involved?
 SHE LAUGHS
No.
 No.
 No, he was... He was my date.
 He was my date.
I need some more wine.
 And you?
 Most of those guys
have left now.
 They're not around any more.
 Not Sarge.
 Oh, so you recognised him, eh?
 I wondered if you would.
 Oh, yeah.
 Now that he's driving an old rust
bucket,
 you should pull him over and
book him. OK.
 And after that can I kill him?
 This is fucking stupid.
Hey, hey. Hey.
 My sense is that you're just working
this too hard.
 I think she just didn't
want to say.
 No. She's afraid to say.
 Hey, hey!
 I'm going home.
 This is stupid.
You don't get it.
 Are you OK?
I'm fine.
 You're not gonna drive home.
Where's your keys?
 I'm all right. I'm all right.
OK, you're not gonna drive.
 Come on, up you get.
SHE GROANS
 DRIER WHIRRS
 PHONE RINGING
 Yeah.
 Hello, there.
You feeling OK?
 Sure.
 Come in.
 You might want
to shut the door.
 What's up? I woke up in your shirt
in your bed.
 How did I get there?
 Well, you had blacked out,
 you threw up on your clothes,
so I washed them.
 Well, why didn't you put me
on the couch?
 It's completely inappropriate.
 Completely.
 What's the alcohol content of that
red? I never pass out.
 Oh, this is masterful.
Stop drinking, it works.
 Zanic's credit card statement.
 Look at March.
 There's five dental billings
in Auckland.
 He wasn't here
when Tui got pregnant.
 He was getting his teeth done.
 Why haven't you asked who wrote the
slogans on his hut?
 Yeah, OK, Miss Marple,
I know this, all right?
 We're on to it.
It's happening.
 So where did you sleep?
On the freaking couch.
 Robin, you passed out. It was my
obligation to look after you.
 Then why don't I feel like
saying thank you?
 Oh, my guess?
You embarrassed yourself.
 SLAMS DOOR
 HORN HONKING
 Excuse me! Excuse me.
 Can I speak to you?
 I'm looking for a Jamie, Tui's
friend. Who are you?
 Sorry. Detective Robin Griffin,
Southern Lakes Police.
 He doesn't have any friends.
He doesn't talk to anyone.
 He texts.
 30, 35 texts.
 I've got to go to work.
 OK. Where?
Mitcham's.
 ANITA SOBBING
 Tui?
 Tui?
 What are you doing here?
SOBBING
 This is Tui's room.
 She could come back any time.
Nobody comes in here. Nobody!
 Get out. Get out!
Matt, I'm... I'm so sorry.
 You must be...
You must be feeling terrible.
 Why would I feel terrible?
I've not done anything.
 You don't mention Tui and I won't
mention your boyfriend, Brad.
 Brad wasn't my boyfriend.
He was a pet, but he...
 That's enough, enough.
I've heard enough of this.
 Pack your things and go.
No, no.
 No, Matt. We can sort this
in the morning.
 You don't put
the cups back properly!
 The handles face out!
 Excuse me.
 I'll get it.
 HORN HONKING
 Hurry up, you stupid bitch.
 HORN HONKING
 There! Ahh!
 SHE CRIES OUT
Stupid bitch!
 See what you made
me fucking do.
 What are you looking at?
Where's Anita?
 Bunny! Bunny!
 Hello! Where's Anita?
 How long do you think
you're going to last here, eh?
 You fucking...
 You are talking
through your arsehole!
 You won't last in this land. Shit's
coming out of your mouth.
 What? What did you say? Yeah, you.
I'm talking to you, arsehole.
 Talk about arseholes...
Shit, just shit,
you have shit for brains.
 Excuse me. Where do you put your
piss and your shit?
 You put it in MY FUCKING LAND!
 That's where you fucking put it.
Oh, bullshit!
 Your fucking menstrual waste.
Excuse me!
 Your fucking... Your scum is going
right in there.
 Menstrual waste? We don't even get
our fucking periods!
 Of course you don't. You know why?
You're unfuckable.
 What's he say?
You're unfuckable.
 You're a dry,
useless, fucking bitch!
SHE SCREAMS
 You, you, unfuckable.
Yes!
 Unfuckable.
Oh, please!
 Unfuckable...
Utterly unfuckable!
 I'm calling the police.
 Oh, and you are so fuckable,
you shit-for-brains.
 Oh, my god! Anita!
Come back!
 Wait, fucker! Do not... Get out of
the car! I'll go!
 Anita, has he hurt you?
 Is she all right?
No, she's not all right.
 ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY
 Fucker! Just fuck you!
 Is she all right?
Get her in here.
 INDISTINCT TALKING CONTINUES
 I know I'm not supposed
to say it,
 but I want to meet
my granddaughter.
 She's got a family.
 This is what's killing me.
 You may not want to see her, but I
do and I'm going to look for her.
 MOBILE CHIMING
 Tui!
 Tui!
 Tui!
 I got lost.
 Left the path,
I couldn't find it again.
 We were just about to
call the police.
 I have to get home.
This is uncomfortable.
 I'm sorry about earlier.
 My emotion surprised me.
 It's the medications.
 Do you really have to go?
 Why didn't you call
if you got lost?
 I couldn't, I... When I tried, my
phone died.
 I'm sorry, Mum.
 OK.
 ENGINE STARTING
 MAN: Have you seen
Zanic's place?
 Guess what?
What?
 Not there?
Not there.
 Ah, she'll be dead, but.
Yeah...
 I'm not saying she's alive
or anything.
 They just didn't find her.
 Well, you didn't find any
bodies at Eel Creek, did you?
 Not playing tonight?
 HE CHUCKLES
 Hey!
 Do you know what the perfect murder
weapon is? No!
 Get fucked, that's what I do.
HE LAUGHS
 Go on, you tell her then,
Sarge.
 An icicle stalagmite.
Ta-da!
 Cos after you
stab them, it melts.
 It self destructs.
 OLD MAN: You're a good man, eh?
 You're buddy's mate.
You're buddy's mate.
 I've got some words
for you, eh?
 There you go.
 Fuck off.
 I know you
from somewhere, don't I?
 You're not a Sydney girl? Hmm?
 Too classy for you
to be a Sydney girl.
 I reckon it's like a
picnic races or something.
 You don't remember me, do you?
 BOTH CHUCKLING
 Probably the Royal
Easter Show, I'm thinking.
 No. Yeah?
 Did we fuck or something?
 We fucking did, didn't we?
 HE SCREAMS
You remember me now, arsehole?
 You remember me now, arsehole?
Do you remember me now?
 Do you remember me now,
you motherfucker?!
 Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you,
piece of fucking shit!
 HE GROANS
Fuck you!
 Piece of fucking shit!
 SHE SCREAMING
 SHOUTING: Fucking remember me now?
 Do you fucking remember me?
 You piece of shit!
 SHE CRIES
 What the fuck
is happening to me?
 SHE GASPS
What the fuck is happening?
 KNOCKING ON DOOR
 CONTINUES KNOCKING
 I want to know the bad thing you
were going to tell me.
 Sarge!
SHOUTING AND ROARING
 Things are going to change when
we find Tui and bring her back here.
 I lost it. It won't happen again.
No.
 Cos you're stood down.
 Can you talk to my boy Jamie?
 Lie low and we'll see
a lot about how this place operates.
