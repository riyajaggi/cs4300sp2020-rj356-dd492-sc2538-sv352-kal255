 Right. You know there's a, Maori legend about this lake that says there's a demon's heart at the bottom of it. It beats, it makes the lake rise and fall every five minutes. - Does it rise and fall? - Yeah. Yeah, it does. It was this, um, a warrior that rescued a maiden from a giant demon called Tipua. And he set fire to the demon's body while it slept and burnt everything but his heart. And the fat melting from the body formed a trough. And the snow from the mountains ran down to fill it to form this lake. My dad died in this lake.

 Yeah. I remember. Sorry. Matt on recording machine: Uh, this is the Mitcham's house. Nobody's here. Call again. (police siren blaring) (officers talking indistinctly) (dial tone) - Man 1: You didn't hear him fall in? - Man 2: No. Man 3: We were cruising along. - I was just going... (mimics engine) - He didn't call out, he just fell off the back. Man 2: I just swore I didn't hear anything. - Hey, Bobby, what's going on? - Coke and kettles, please. Salt. I didn't know Bob Platt, you see. But many people wanted to see him drown. Not me. Not me. Not me, no. Not me. Did I, uh, did I just say me? You drink on duty? Hey... Give these to someone else, will you, mate? The prefect's here. Excuse me. Are you Luke Mitcham? Is Tui at home? I've been trying to ring your dad, but no one's picked up. And... Is he at home? Oh, I don't know. I have an appointment to see Tui this afternoon. If he lets you in. If he's home. Yeah, if he's home. - (doorbell ringing) - (Dogs barking) Yeah? Detective Robin Griffin. Southern Lakes police. Matt: So? I'm wanting to chat with Tui, if I may? You could if she was here. Is she at school? I doubt she's at school. No. Do you mind if I come in and look around? Yeah, I do. Do you mind? You're Jude and Ivan's daughter, aren't you? Yes. And you're a Detective? Okay. Let's see who you look like. (buzzer sounding) Matt: Hey, girl. - You like dogs? - Yes. Would you like an orphaned one? No thanks. I'm in a dilemma. This is Bob Platt's dog. I was hoping she would settle in. She's already bit my dog and she's riled up the others. Why have you got Platt's dog? He drowned. Didn't you hear? She was hungry so I took her in. No dog should go hungry. It's not right. (dog whimpers) You're going to shoot her? If you don't want her. (dogs barking in the distance) Wasn't there anyone else who could have taken her? How about Platt's wife? Platt didn't have a wife. Truth is he was a dumb prick. Nobody liked him. Nobody liked his dog either, except me. Hey, Coco. Hey, come here, girl. Come here. One of my rescues. Said she was too aggressive. Bit some kids. So I taught her some manners and give her to Tui. So she's Tui's dog now. But Tui's not here? 'Cause I see her dog, - And her bike. - No. No, she's not here and if she is, doesn't want to talk to you. But you'd tell me. Right? You're the one doing the talking. Let me out. It's good what you're doing, you know? Helping out my daughter. She's in a tough spot. Just understand one thing. No one loves her more than me. No one. Robin: Whoa, boy. Whoa. Robin: Do you know whose horse this is? Woman 1: Yes, it belongs to a girl called Tui Mitcham. Robin: She's fallen off? Woman 2: Well, we don't know yet. Woman 1: Well, that's what I'm worried about. I can't figure it out. She, she stayed with us up at the camp last night. But she left early this morning to go back home again. - Robin: When was the last time you saw her? - Well, when she left this morning. Woman: She went up to feed her chihuahua this morning. Bunny: That was hours ago. We've got all the women looking out for her. Woman: Hey, someone to check the ditches. Oh, well, what about up the road? (police siren blaring) (people talking indistinctly) Man: Not good. (horn blaring) (country music playing) This is for a fuck. Seven minutes, not a minute more. I'll be in... Room 6. (door closing) (knocking) Woman: Come in. Take a shower. When you finish, the clock will start ticking. I like to be undressed, that should take two minutes. That leaves five for the fuck. Sarge: Why the seven minutes? Please undress me. - Um... - Sarge. Please undress me, sarge. Time's running out. Why the time limit? Do you really wanna know? Yeah. I have these compulsions, serious ones. That my teacher is helping me with. If I spend more than seven minutes with a man, with any kind of a man, I run the danger of growing a romantic attachment that could take seven weeks or seven months to get over. - Yeah, right. - Slower. The time thing's probably arbitrary, but it's a restriction... (gasps) ...That stops me feeling too much. (scoffs) Jesus, I don't feel much about anybody, really. Nothing? Not even angry? No. Oh, uh, pissed off maybe. Hmm. (sighs) Leave it be. How are we going for time? - Well... (sighs) - You want your tits done? Don't talk. Uh, just shove my hands and my head where you want them. Yeah, yeah. Here. (both grunting) (moaning) Robin: Right. Well, the most important is immigration. Good. Hospitals and homeless shelters? Right. Great. Thank you. Um, well, I'm off track somewhere near Lake Sylvan. Paula from the cafe thinks she saw smoke out here this morning. Okay. Thank you, Zena. (mobile phone beeps) (sighs) (breath trembling) (panting) Are you early? I hope so. Did you sleep there? I'll see you in an hour. It's a bit of a turn off, they're not gonna be gay. I don't know. For who? I don't have a boyfriend. - Hello. - Hey. Take a look at this, then. Name tags, mate. - That's me. That's my seat. - Yeah. - No, yours is over here, isn't it? - Use someone else's. (mumbling) Shh. Okay. Tui Angel Mitcham, 12 years of age. Matt Mitcham and Kimmie Wongsawat's only daughter. Eurasian appearance and she is at present five months pregnant. She was last seen at the paradise property. The new residents, eight females, said she arrived by horse and stayed one night. And according to Matt Mitcham, she never came home. But her dog did. And her horse was found here, on the race river bridge. - So, either she fell or... - Eh, how about we start with the current situation? I thought I was. Al: The clear facts. How long's she been missing for? Thirty-six hours. - Well, that's not a good sign already. - Correct. And let's also remember we are looking at a crime. Whoever did this to her might want to hide her, or even eliminate her to avoid the possibility of a DNA match. There was a case in Canada and another in Australia where young victims were found with their wombs removed. (groans) So, who are the suspects? So far, it's the usual family members. Matt Mitcham and his sons, Mark, Luke and Johnno. But there is one other possible suspect. A Wolfgang Zanic. He's on the sexual crimes register as a paedophile. He's 55, Austrian, resident of Eel Creek, Laketop. Two previous arrests and one conviction. And he did time at MT Eden. - Two years, reduced from five. - Hmm. Is anyone aware of him? Yeah, I know Wolfie. Does a couple of shifts at the Laketop pub. - Uh-huh. And? -Oh, you don't want to go up there interviewing him, bud... Yeah? Why not? He's a deer stalker, Al. He's got he's got a bunk bed piled high with rifles. Has he got a cellar? I suggest a search warrant for Wolfgang Zanic, Al. Um... Pete, can you review his weapons license? Yep. Right now, I want to search the river flats first. And then sections of the bush from the routeburn saddle down to greenstone. Robin. Hi. Uh, John. I'm coordinating search and rescue. - Hi. -Do you realize you've nominated an area of around 200,000 acres of bush land? No, I didn't know the acreage. John: No one will be found if they're hiding. It's going to be very difficult. John, I'm sorry it's difficult. No, what I mean is, even if we do find her. - Won't she just run off again? - Robin: No. Even if Tui manages to stay out in the bush and keep alive. What will happen when she has the baby? The overwhelming likelihood is that they'll both die. Don't mumble, Joy, speak up. (scoffs) What about in primitive societies where they get married early and just wander off lying in the bush to give birth. What about that? What? Well, I just think you're exaggerating. In any case though, more than likely she's already kicked. Could I speak to you in the hall? Now. Now? (indistinct chatter) What's this? About women giving birth in the bush? Oh, I saw it on a National Geographic documentary. Where did your wife give birth? - In hospital, right? - What I'm saying is that in Africa... We're talking about a 12-year-old, whose pelvis may not be developed enough to deliver a full-term baby. - Thanks. I got to go. Sorry for the... - Robin: What? Um... Excuse me... There's a couple more matters. I've set up a file. Wildbird. Please add to it whenever you have relevant information. And also, I've put in a c24 to DNA test every male in the Laketop area. Including teachers, coaches etcetera in Queenstown. What? Al. Now, has that gone through? Al: All right. Don't erupt mate. Or we'll start with your DNA sample. I don't want officer Joy on the team. - I think we got that. - Good. Why weren't they listening? It was like... Yeah, yeah. Day two, she's dead. Yeah. Maybe some of them. This is nice. Yeah, coffee's great. Local business community set it up. It's um... It's a youth support scheme, really. We teach, uh, struggling kids hospitality skills, they get a barista certificate. Then they can compete with the Gabby kids who've got manners. Uh, chase, the usual, thanks, and for you? Uh, skinny flat white. - Anything else with it? - There's a huh? Mate? Mate, open your mouth when you talk, okay? People need to hear you. - Anything else with it? - No, thanks. Oh, you could understand that? "Anything else with it." Yeah, these are some of the graduates. Hmm. Tui. - Yeah. She was headed for an old judge direction. - What was she doing? Shoplifting. Hair clips, chemist stuff. Hey, don't over-think it. You did well today. They're a bloody hard bunch to win over. Anyway, today did me good. It was, um... It was a good reminder. You know, when you spoke, you spoke with real heart. I like that. I, um... I didn't join the force for the right reasons. (smirks) No? - Does anyone? - Hmm. - Thank you. - When I was a teenager, there was a murder in our apartment block. A crime of passion. These two detectives arrived. Very, very smartly dressed. They were full of flare. My mother and her friends couldn't do enough for them. And my mother ended up dating one of those two detectives. When he cheated on her, she dated the other one. Look. So what's your story? An avenging angel? - Don't know about angel. - Oh, I do. So, uh... Who's getting you all to himself? What? Sparkler on your left hand. Oh. Steve. He's a cop, too, so... - He's a really good guy. - Oh, yeah. But? But what? Oh, that's the thing with good guys. Very boring. He sets the bar high. While I'm here, I'm gonna have a bit of a think. Oh, you're going to have a bit of a fling? - No. (chuckling) a bit of a think. - Oh? (chuckles) - A think. - Oh. Al, look. I need a budget. I need helicopters. I want to search the river banks and the lake and up into the bush. One helicopter a day. Two. We can cover the area quicker. All right. But, um, the lake's another thing, that's 77 kilometres long. And it's uh, almost a kilometre deep in some areas. Well, what if she's in there? Well, if she is, she's gone. - Well, what about Bob Platt? - I'm sorry, but if Tui was weighted, what with the water pressure, she might never come up. And Bob Platt wasn't weighted, his death was an accident. You know what my bet is? Tui's gonna come back into the house one night, curl up in bed, very grateful. Very grateful? No, I don't think so. (helicopter whirring) How the fuck could you leave her on her own when you knew she wasn't well? Melissa: Stop talking about me, dad! You arsehole! I had to fly back from Beijing. - I'm fine! I'm fucking fine! - The hospital wouldn't release her, right, without a parent to sign. Where the fuck were you? What are you doing here? - Are you out of your mind? - Shut up! You've got 15 minutes to pack a carry-on bag. That's all we can fit in the chopper. No. No, Jock. (sighs) Anita: You know, he had the softest, softest fur. Softer than, than, than anything you could imagine. And these, these really big eyes. You think it would be all gristly, but it was really... (clears throat) What's the problem, Jock? I don't have a problem. Actually, I'm getting married again. Quite a young woman. We're having a baby shortly and I... I know that's all a bit cliche, but... No, the problem is Bunny's daughter. Now, what sort of program do you run here? - No program. - Anita: No program. You must have some type of timetable, a structure? - No structure. - No structure. So what happens here? Nothing. We stop. We... We don't think. We don't do. (whispers) Don't do. And you're the teacher? No, no teacher. She won't talk to me. She swears at me. She wouldn't sit next to me on the plane. How long have you got? Oh, I have to get that helicopter back in an hour. - So I would say... - Mmm. - Five, 10 minutes. - Mmm-mmm. Mmm. Not enough, Jock. Shit, how long do you want? I don't know. But minimum, seven days. And no guarantees. Seven. Listen, I'm leaving Melissa with you in your care and if anything happens to her, I'll come back in full force. Big Mr Jock. Can't look after your own daughter, so you expect me to. No. Don't accept. Get him a chocolate. (Melissa strumming guitar) You all right? (vocalising) (mobile ringing) Hello? Can you take me over paradise? That's where Tui was last seen. Man 1 over radio: Delta echo Charlie. I'm in Laketop looking to go over the double barrel to paradise. Have you spotted any smoke? Man 2 over radio: No, nothing yet. Man 1 over radio: Welcome to paradise. See this clearing, they call it eden. Oh, look, there's Eve as well. Delta echo Charlie, heading north up the dart now. We'll go over the saddle and come back down the rees, over. (helicopter whirring) (people talking indistinctly) Why weren't you at the search? There's no point. There's no point looking for your sister? Here's her jacket. Where was it? Some kids found it down by the lake edge where she went in. Those kids didn't say anything to you? No. For five minutes? Nothing? (unzipping jacket) What would she be wishing for? You should never have taken her back to Matt's. I want to interview you. Okay, well, what's your number? Oh. Mine's 021-967-4114. You can call anytime. (upbeat music playing) (people talking indistinctly) (men laughing) I want to thank everyone for coming here today. You did the right thing. Course, most of us knew we weren't going to find anything, 'cause Tui's not stupid enough to go camping in the bottom of the riverbed. But the powers that be know better than us. So we had us a search picnic. Hope you all enjoyed yourselves. Let's hear it for the powers that be. I still think that Tui is out there. That's what I think. She's got the skills to survive and she knows, my little one knows that in her heart of hearts. She can come home whenever she feels like it. No matter what she's done, doesn't matter. She can come home. We're a small town and we all know no one can hide anything. Someone here knows something. I look at the mountains and the hills and I like to think of my little one shooting deer, hunting. Doing whatever she needs to do to survive. What I can't bear is the very idea that someone has her chained up against a wall holding my little one captive. So she can suck his cock whenever he feels like it... Okay, Matt, I think we get the picture. You've had your little party. So, if anyone wants to come forward. Not tomorrow, not next week, not next month, not next year. But right now, It's your last chance. If you are that person, and you're holding something back, then quite frankly, You deserve to fucking die. We'll fucking kill you. Huh, Lukey? Thanks, Matt. Al: I think, um... I think everybody here, uh, understands what you, er, must be going through at the moment. Okay, people, Matt's been kind enough to put some money behind the bar so everyone can have a drink. Mark: Yeah, but they're only actually for people that were there. Excuse me, the drinks are only for the people that were on the river flats between 12 and 4.30 P.M., okay? There's a few of you who weren't here, like Penguin. - Fuck, I was... -You weren't there, mate. Pay up. Boganville. (upbeat music playing) Putty: It is beautiful down there. Just beautiful... Tui should stay down there. I'll tell her. I must tell Tui all about this. Buy me a vodka. Could you, could you buy me a vodka? (Putty muttering indistinctly) You've got to leave her down there, you see, because it's so beautiful. It's also slo-mo. And just leave her down there. And you can get fucked. Yeah, go get fucked. Mike: Yeah, fuck off, Terry. You from Sydney? Not now. Oh, sounds like you are. Are you the Detective? - Sounds like you are. - All: Ooh! So, tell me, you a feminist? Penguin: Are you a lesbian? - You'd be better off being a lesbian. - Why's that? Well, it's pretty lonely up here. Because? Well, no one likes a feminist, except a lesbian. Well, that makes sense. So I get a lesbian. What do you get? Who would want you? About 10,000 sheep. They're up there in the cold and dark waiting for us. What? A sheep's vagina is the closest thing to a woman's vagina, So I can get it whenever I want. Anything with a pulse, eh? - (laughter) - Fuck you. Not as good as Thai pussy, though. I mean, they make all other women irrelevant. Not just talking about the sex, either. It's the little fruit salads they make you when you wake up. Bonuses. (man whistles) You be careful. Mitcham got himself a Thai lady. Yeah, and we've got Tui, our Thai poontang. Excuse me? Hey, what does it mean when a girl gets around town wearing tiny shorts? I don't know. What does it mean? It means she's hot. - Or a slut. - (Men laughing) (Penguin exclaims) Jesus Christ! (Penguin squeaking) The girl was 12. Yeah, she's a liar, okay? She tells a lot of lies. I don't care what she said. I'm going to collect the DNA of every man in this town. And when that baby is born, One of you gentlemen will go to jail. (men exclaim) Shotover: Well, I'm ready, love. You can collect mine now. Putty doesn't come in cups. No, no, no. - Ah, she's just a kid. - Putty: I don't come in cups. - You wouldn't catch me. - No, I don't serve you. - Mike: Come on. - No! - Fuck! - Terry: Good bloke, eh? Except he's your main suspect, according to that cop, Joy. - That's the gingerbread man, Zanic. - Robin: Zanic? - That's him? - Yeah. Shotover reckons he heard a girl crying at his place the other night. (dog barking in distance) (unchaining door) Who are you feeding? My old lady. May I come in? Why are you snooping around the house here? That's Tui. Ja. Tui. She's wearing lederhosen because never enough boys. I teach kids folk dancing. Tui was a good dancer. Pumpernickel? I saw your charge sheet. Ja, so... I'm not supposed to work with children. But you have been. I don't touch no one. What happened in Auckland? Long time ago now. Uh, I was working at hotel. Cook. Good job. Everything going okay. Then, one evening, The most beautiful person I ever saw in my life come into dining hall. - That was a young boy? - Yeah. At first, he sit alone. He ordered a hamburger. Then his family come to dinner. We get talking. I realize they don't understand him. They don't know him. And they don't love him. How old was he? Ja, so... I'm sick, old man who should be looking for love of equals. What you call real love. But you don't realize, something so pure, so powerful. You never have it. I chuck up on what people call real love. I do big shit on real love. I already sit in jail for him, thinking about him. I don't care if I tell you. I love him. And you can't do nothing. Where were you last Thursday? I am on medication. No harm to anybody. No danger to the people. Not dangerous. Someone said they heard crying. I need to look through the house. Is there a basement? Oh, ja. The basement. Zanic? (Wolfgang panting) I never hurt kid! - (gunshot) - (Robin grunts) (dogs howling) I never! Never hurt kid! - They said I hurt kids! - (Dogs barking) Robin: Tui! Tui! Tui, if you're here, call out! (gunshot) Fuck. (gunshot) (dialling) Hello, Johnno? It's Robin. I've done something a bit silly and I'm going to need your help pretty fast. - Where are you? - Do you know Wolfie Zanic? Yeah, yeah, Eel Creek. - I'll be there in 10 minutes. - No, no, no, wait. He's outside and he has a gun. Yeah, okay. Just lock the doors, front and back, Stay away from the windows. I'll be there. (Robin breathing heavily) (upbeat music playing on car stereo) Johnno: Wolfie, where are you? Wolfie, step out! Wolfie, can you hear me? (cocks gun) You're okay. (softly) It's okay. I'm alone. It's all right. It's okay. You're fine. Wolfie, Wolfie, it's fine. I didn't do nothing. I know. I know. I know. I didn't do nothing. I know. It's okay, it's okay. Put it down. (Wolfgang crying) Johnno: Robin! I never hurt kid! Do you want to come in for some tea? I'd like to, but I can't. I've got someone waiting. Okay. Thanks.
