 You and I have got something
in common, you know that? Yeah?
 A little girl.
 There's a favour I want.
 Don't see Johnno.
 We are looking for a hidden file.
Photographs, accounts.
 Look at this.
 What's that?
 SHE SCREAMS
GUNSHOT
 SHOUTING
Well, go on then, kill me!
Just leave it alone!
 This programme contains some violent
scenes, strong language and some
scenes of a sexual nature.
 Are you coming in?
 I want to
testify against Matt.
 When do you want to do it?
Now?
 No, mate. No, not right now.
I'm a little bit high.
 It's a promise
on my son's head.
 I'll go to the police station.
Wherever you want.
 And I can get some
other girls, too.
 Sara and Narelle.
We can do it
the day after tomorrow.
 Can you make some notes?
It will help you to remember.
 I want you to.
 Love you.
 Don't you give up.
 Hey, where's Al?
 Is he in?
Yeah, he wanted to see you.
 He's downstairs in the cellar room
tAlking to some chick
 who whacked
someone at the World Bar.
 Whoa!
 No, stand up, love.
Stand up. Come on, straight.
 We need to take a statement.
 Have you seen the detective sergeant?
No.
 We need to take
a statement here, mate.
 No, this is the part where
I have green cream.
 Green cream?
Green cream.
 What about, um...
 Getting a job organised there?
Yes, absolutely. Very good.
 OK. Well... Good seeing you.
Thank you.
 And, um...
 Tegan? A customer.
 Can I join you?
HE CLEARS THROAT
 Well, look at, look at the customer
when they are ordering.
 She'll tell you what she wants.
Flat white, thank you.
 OK, I'll see you
back there, Pete.
 Matt Mitcham wants
to make a confession
 And he wants to make it
to you alone.
 What about?
 I don't know.
He says it's personal.
 About Tui?
 Wow.
 Well, I don't want you
going up there alone,
 so I'll get Pete to drive you
and he can stay as backup.
 However, Matt said you can
record the interview,
you can even videotape it.
 So you can get the gear out of
the store room.
 What's your name?
Tegan.
 Thanks, Tegan.
 See you later.
 Matt wants to make a confession,
just to me.
 I'm going out there tomorrow.
He's up to something
 And you know what, Robin? You're
being naive. It'll be a setup.
 He said I can record it.
 I don't like it.
 Why don't you make him come into the
station like anybody else?
 Someone like Matt wants to
stage his own confession.
 It gives him a sense of control
when his world's falling apart.
 You know what's special
and scary about today?
 What's that?
 Tui's baby's due.
 How is she going to manage?
 You know,
when I was in Bang Kwang...
 ..I would lie awake at night,
thinking
 I was going to die in that place.
 I didn't care.
 But not loving anyone...
 ..not knowing a woman deeply,
that made me sad.
 Now I'm scared cos I do.
 Fuckin' scared.
 New batteries.
Should last four to six hours.
 Be careful you
don't switch it off.
 Yeah, I know that.
 Let's go, Elliott.
 What the distress code?
"That's unacceptable".
 If I say it twice,
it means get reinforcements.
 DOG BARKS
 BARKING CONTINUES
 SHE BUZZES
 GATES BEEP
 This isn't going to be easy.
Take your time.
 Is it on?
 OK.
 Best just get on
with it then, eh?
 Right.
 Your father's not dead.
 No, that's not possible.
 I've seen
the death certificate
 And the pathologist's report.
 I requested it ten years ago.
 Well, I'm here to tell you
he's very much alive.
 Some old video footage
from the early '80s.
 Just after your parents arrived,
Before you were born.
 Recognise anyone?
 Is that Mum?
 She was a goodlooking woman.
 Movie star material.
Take your breath away.
 It was
frustrating for her up here.
 Nowhere to strut her stuff,
doll up.
 The women at Laketop didn't
understand her, really.
 Some didn't wear bras
or shave their legs.
 Your mum thought she could
teach them something,
but they didn't want to learn.
 Here's your dad.
 No, that's not Dad.
 He was a foot taller than Mum.
 There was a lot of partying
in those days.
 The road to town was bad,
sometimes impassable.
 There was a bit
of mucking around.
 Whether you like it or not, this is
where it all began for you.
 With my seed.
 It was all secret.
 There was a few tears from her,
 and then, Lo and behold, all these
years later, here you are.
 All grown up.
 Kind of puts a different light
on things, doesn't it?
 No, it doesn't.
 I loved my father and he drowned.
 You're my seed, girl.
 My blood.
 I knew it.
 What the fuck did he say?
 What happened?
 You're my brother.
 My halfbrother.
 No, he's lying. This is one of his
fuckin' setups.
 He showed me video footage
of him and my mother.
 He said they had an affair.
 Hello, brother.
 You're freezing.
I'm going to go get you a towel.
 Do you think it's
harder than being gay?
 I'm telling you,
he's fuckin' lying.
 You don't know what he's like.
 He's a pathological fuck.
He's a fuckin' liar.
 Just do a DNA test.
 Come to bed with me.
 SHE SOBS
 I heard you
were on the way up.
 Come on in.
 Officer Pete tell you?
 Yeah.
 Do you want to sit down?
 Are you OK?
 How long have you known?
 Not long.
 That was the, that was the
purpose of the boat trip.
 I wanted you to hear it as soon as
possible, and it had to be from
Matt.
 Have you requested a DNA test? No.
 well, I'd definitely check.
I want to go after him. Hard.
 And it's gotta be soon, Al.
 Simone has said she'll
testify against him.
 I'm guessing that's
his drug operation.
 She'll bring others.
Narelle, Sara, possibly.
 Certainly that has to be enough to
get a search warrant for a raid,
 but this time...
Hang on a second,
 I'll just get officer Joy to listen
to this.
 Why? Well, we're going to have to get
somebody to take over the
investigation.
 Zena,
 Can you get officer Joy
to come in, please?
 Thanks.
 Why do you need him?
Well, he's going to help.
 How? Robin, you're Matt's daughter.
 Your investigation is impeded by the
fact that you're related.
 I've Already had his lawyer
on the phone to me.
 Joy, come in. You can take over from
Detective Griffin, please?
 I want to do it, Al.
Al, I'm on holiday tomorrow, Sir.
 I'm going to WAles. Ginny's parents
have their golden wedding
celebration.
 OK, um, well we can get somebody
to cover for you. How long you
away for?
 Three weeks. Pete, can you come over
here, please?
 You can take over from, um, Joy.
 Eh?
This isn't going to work, Al.
 Just give Joy the contact addresses
for Simone and her friends,
then Pete can follow up.
 Al, I've got that Franklin situation.
I'm working it over.
Well you can do that after.
 Just leave the information on my
desk. I'll get some legwork on it.
 Seriously? Yeah, well, we can
prioritise it.
 Or I'll get Elliott to do it
or something.
 Robin?
 Hi, how are you?
 GLASS SMASHES
 Hello? Who is it?
Can't see who's in it.
 Bunny?
My God, it's a girl.
 Turn the car off.
 OK. What's her name?
Shh!
 Annemarie!
Phewee! She's been drinking.
 I'll go get her.
Get Anne Marie, darling.
 Anne Marie!
 Anne Marie! Careful, careful.
We'll get her out.
 Not something you'd expect on
a Saturday morning.
 She's awake! Oi! She's awake.
 She's awake.
All right, all right.
 Her clothes aren't ready.
I'm soaking them.
 OK.
 Will you come? Soon.
 How are you?
 Yeah, pretty fucked.
 Here.
 Take a couple.
 You been fighting?
 I want to talk to GJ.
 OK. Sure, OK.
 What's Gold up to today?
 This one...
 I don't meditate.
 INDISTINCT CHATTER
 WOMAN CHUCKLES
 What are the Chinese doing?
 I don't know how to keep living.
 Who is she?
She's the, um, detective.
 I remember the detective.
 So, you're on your knees?
 Good. Now die to yourself.
 To your idea of yourself. Everything
you think you are, you're not.
 What's left? Find out.
 I've just realised
that who I thought I was,
 Who my father
and mother were...
 Stop!
 Stop thinking.
 (Stop thinking.)
 Coffee.
 What are these
crazy bitches doing?
 They're meditating.
 Have you people
paid your trailer rent?
 SEVERAL WOMEN: Yeah.
No freeloading.
 50 bucks a week.
You've gotta work.
 Noone will pay you for
closing your eyes.
 GJ, I need to help Tui.
 You people All
want to help someone.
 That one. That one
wants to help Africa.
 Help yourself first.
Like the aeroplane.
 Put on your own mask first.
 How do I help myself?
 Why should I tell you
when you don't listen?
 I'm listening.
No!
 All you hear are your own
crazy thoughts,
 Like a river of shit,
on and on.
 See your thoughts
for what they are.
 Stop your helping.
Stop your planning.
 Give up! There's no way out.
 Not for others, not for you.
 We are living out here
at the end of the road,
 the end of the earth,
in a place cAlled paradise.
 How's it going? Perfect?
 No.
 You are madder than ever.
 You are tired?
 So lie down right here.
 Be like a cat. Heal yourself.
 There is no match for the tremendous
intelligence of the body.
 Rest.
 SHE WHIMPERS
 When is the next
flight to Reykjavik?
 Um, Iceland. Any route preference
or carrier?
 No. Just get away from
these crazy bitches.
 Get fucked!
 I have a guy here on a bike heading
into Chinaman.
 MATT: Don't bother with him.
We're looking for smoke, yeah?
 Tui is way too clever to show
any smoke, so don't waste
time looking for any.
 Just keep an eye on the huts.
If you see her, move on
like it's routine.
 Come again. Understood?
 Copy that. OK.
 DOG BARKS
Wham!
 Luke, grab that one. Luke!
 Dad. Dad.
 What's this?
It's for the baby.
 Yeah, we were going to clean it up.
Whose baby?
 Tui. Tui can't have a baby.
What are you on, man?
 She's 12. There's no baby.
She's a kid.
 Kids don't have babies. They don't
have fuckin' babies.
 I did not push Simone's
boy over that cliff.
I wasn't even there.
 And if she saying that I was...
Dad, she didn't say you did.
 Where is she, then?
Where's Simone?
 Fuck knows. She blames me.
I know she blames me.
 And where's Delia? Where's Sara?
Where are they?
 Well, let me tell you this.
If they're not working,
and they're not working,
 Then they pay rent.
 Unless they're working,
you don't stay at Laketop.
 You either show respect,
or you get the fuck out! Yeah?
 Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah!
 You OK, Dad?
 My head hurts.
 My head really hurts.
 Luke, can you get
me something, please?
 Well, what sort of headache is it?
It's just banging, man.
It's just banging.
 I need to stay awake.
OK, methamphetamines aren't
going to help, Dad.
 When I get a location on Tui,
soon as I get a location on Tui,
I'm off.
 I'm out of here.
I'm going to get our girl,
 That's what I'm going to do.
 Luke! Yeah?
 Just take one of these.
 What is this?
It's a sedative.
 It'll help with your head
and you can get some rest.
 You don't fuckin' listen to me!
I need to stay alert!
 I need to stay focused!
Yeah, but you've got a headache.
 You know the thing with you two?
The thing with you two is
you never extended yourselves.
 You've never put yourself out
in your lives.
 You've never loved anyone.
 You're empty.
 You're nothing.
 Mum knows.
Mum knows best.
 Here we go. Whoops, steady, careful.
Careful, steady.
 Good boy, good boy.
Gotta get there.
 Gotta get there in time.
Hurry up, Putty! Hurry up!
 OK, OK, Mum.

 MAN GROANS
 # Drag me down to the water
 # Hold me down until I'm full
 # Until I struggle no longer
 # Until I've drowned
in my sinful will
 # Bound my hands to the stake
 # Set fire to the ground below...#
 Watch him.
 Zena called.
I thought you were asleep.
 Have the results come in?
 From both the labs.
And is there a match?
 BABY GURGLES
Al wants to tell you himself.
He's coming out now.
 Bunny?
 I know.
 What's up?
 How many do you want to order?
 How many are we allowed?
I think three. Three?
 Hey, Tui. Hi. My gosh!
 Oh! So cute!
 So tiny.
 That's yours?
 Hello, darling!
 Hi. Is there, um, somewhere
we can talk?
 Here's Matt.
 Don't know what you've got planned
for him, but here he is.
 How's Tui going?
 Through the day, you wouldn't
know anything was wrong.
 But, at night, she...
 She has terrible nightmares.
 We, cross-checked the results with
two labs because...
 Quite frankly, I'm surprised
and I'm sickened.
 Here we are.
 I'm still shaking my head because
I can't really believe it.
 Matt's the father of Tui's baby.
 For all his faults,
I thought he had more decency.
 BABY CRIES
 Shut up!
 What about the baby?
Is the baby OK?
 As far as I can see, yeah.
 Chromosomes are all normal.
 Al, how are we going to put her
in court?
 She so confused. She doesn't even
seem to know she shot Matt.
 She talks as if
he's still alive.
 She won't see a court,
I can promise you that.
 Matt was pointing a gun
at her baby, right?
 Yeah.
 Seems like your mother had
her own midwinter madness.
 Matt's not your father, mate.
 TUI: He won't shut up!
 He's crying over nothing.
 Righto, baristas. Grad night.
 Come on.
Are you coming?
 You decided on the pizzas yet?
 Can Tui come too?
We all want to hang out.
 Yeah, it's fine by me.
 Um, maybe ask Robin, though.
 Is it all right if Tui comes?
I want to go.
 You sure? She can share my sleeping
bag. It quite big. It opens out.
 Let her go.
 You'll call me if
you change your mind?
 Get your mobile. Phone.
 I'll come and get you, OK?
 OK. So, what's the decision?
 Wait.
 Bye, Noah.
 Have fun!
HE BEEPS HORN
 Bye!
 What is it?
 She needs to be a kid again.
Just needs to be able
to hang out with her friends.
 Perfectly normal. And we need to be
normal. Or try to be normal.
 Or pretend to be normal.
 Come on, let's get out of here.
 Have a coffee. What you want?
You want a flat white?
 You going to talk to me here?
You going to pay me some attention?
 She has her phone.
She'd call if she needed us.
 I'll call her, OK?
 You're apart from Tui again.
 It feels traumatic.
It's not surprising.
 Here you go.
 ANSWER SERVICE: 'Hey, this is Tui.
I can't speak to you right now.
 'Can you text me?'
 No answer?
I'll send a message.
 Excuse me, have you got Tegan's
number? Sure.
 Thank you.

 Bad boy. What do you want me to do?
Hit the ground, put my hands in the

 Just stop it, Al.
I'm sorry. This is my night off.
 I'm a bit loaded, that's all.
Where are they?
 Hey? Who? The kids.
 Thought my DVDs were shit so they've

 They said they were going to call.
Didn't they call?
 They've probably turned
their phones off. Yeah.
 Just give it a try.
Who you ringing?
 MOBILE PHONE RINGS INSIDE HOUSE
 Looks like she left it.
I'll just go and get it.
