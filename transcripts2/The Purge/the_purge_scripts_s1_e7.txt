 Previously, on The Purge. There! Right there! Get them! Stop. Hands in the air. You know, I thought by now you'd be in a position where you wouldn't have to work on a night like this. If you'd had just played the game a little... Oh, Mom, don't start. I just wanted to let you know that whatever happens, I love you. Now, Miss Barbour, I'd love to show you the rest of my collection. It's a living, breathing art gallery. Anya here learned how to play the game.

 You sick son of a bitch. No! No! - We're the Matron Saints. - Mmm-hmm. Protect the females of this fair nation against the gendercide of Purge. Hey, guys! Going out tonight? - Stay safe, Ross. - You too. Rick, open it! Do you still love her? I don't know. Let me in! Please! Let me in! Please help! Rick, Jenna, open up, please! Jenna. Jenna, wait. Wait. No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

 - Are you kidding me? - We have to be smart here. Think about the baby. - Lila could be killed. - So could we. Look. Look. Somebody's out there. Oh, my God. Help! - Rick. We have to. Let me go. - Please! - Go. - Okay, okay, okay. I'll open the gate, I'll close it the second she's inside, okay? Be careful. Please! Please! - Lila. - Jenna! Oh, my God, please! Lila! Rick, help! Lila! Lila, give me your hand! Lila! Let me reach her, go, go, go! Come on, come on! Come on! Oh, God. Oh, God. Come on, come on. Oh, shit. Piece of shit! Fuck you. - Get her arms tight. - Bastard. Get off of me. Where you going? You're going to walk away from me? You coward. Thank you for coming. I know getting here in the afternoon isn't easy. Mmm. I really just wanted to meet the mother of my favorite student. - She's not in trouble? - Oh, not at all. Oh, please. Jane is excelling in every subject, especially math. She's got a real knack for it. Your daughter is exceptional. You should be very proud. So, does this mean I got into the robotics lab? It was very close. Brad just edged you out. It wasn't up to me, but I am sure we can get you there next semester. Her grandma came from Barbados with $8 in her pocket. This right here... That's the reason why she did it. Well, let's make her grandma even happier by getting Jane into a great college. How much is that gonna cost? With Jane's grades and grit? She should qualify for scholarships. I'll make sure she does. Oh, I always knew you were smart. You get that from me, you know. I'm smart too. I know, Mom. You just keep studying and doing what you're doing, and who knows what could happen. Well, I will be the first in our family to go to college. Yes, you will. You know those pageants that Candice does? - You know, they pay scholarships. - It's not my thing, Mom. Hey. I'm gonna tell you something that no one else is going to tell you because they don't love you like I do. Your looks are an asset, and they can be just as powerful as that super-duper brain. - Put 'em together, and you're unstoppable. - Mom... If you wanna make it in their world, you gotta play their game. Jane, Jane, Jane. You're making this much worse than it needs to be. I am? There will be light touching, a little rubbing, but nothing too intrusive. Too intrusive? You piece of shit. You're gonna hurt yourself if you keep fighting. Fuck you. Who are they? Not your buddies, I recognize them from the floors. The girls. How'd you get them here? What did you do to them? I have no idea how they got here. I leave that to the Collectors. All your speeches and emails about diversity and equality, it was all bullshit. No, no, no. Not at all. I admire the female form. What do you think we're all doing here? We're celebrating women. We're celebrating you, Jane. You are disgusting. You are absolutely repulsive. A predator. Only on the night when it doesn't count. How many nights did you spend thinking about this one? About the same number you spent planning my murder. Hey, hang tight. Anya. Anya. Anya. You're not going to let this happen, are you? Anya? Anya? Yo, yo, yo, yo. Come on, come on. Get out. Let's go, let's go. There's a riot! - Let's go. - Quick, run. They're gone. Let's go. Come on. All right, we gotta hurry. Come on. No. We can fit. All right, come on, quick, let's go. Yeah, show him who's boss! Let's go back that way. Go. We just need to get to the woods. Get up, get up. Crazy. Go, go. You're okay. You're okay. You're safe here, okay? You're with me. Let's see. Oh, Jesus, your head. They started shooting. I didn't know if you made it. We did. We did. - That man... Is he? - No, he's gone. He's gone. Lila, Lila? Lila, he's gone. Okay? It's all clear, barricade's secure. My parents... It was... - Oh, my God. - Hey, you're okay now. You're alive. It's over. Look at me. You're okay. You're safe. - We need to get her cleaned up. - Yeah. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. It's okay. All right, gentlemen. Please welcome contestant number 19 to the stage. Jane Barbour. Jane is a high school junior, where she's captain of the math team and vice president of her student council. When she's not doing homework, she enjoys seeing movies with her friends and baking with hermom. Her favorite subjects include science and calculus, and she hopes to become an engineer or a biologist after college. Sparkle, baby, you got this. Give a warm round of applause for contestant 19, Jane Barbour. Please welcome to the stage contestant number 20, Shelby Young. Shelby is from... Don't ever drop that smile, baby. I don't want to do this anymore. What? All I said was to smile. I feel gross out there. We put too much in it to give up now. And you've been winning. We're real close to the big leagues. And state pageants have big scholarship money. If this is about scholarships, why am I in a bikini? Look, I don't make the rules. We just have to play by 'em. Mom, please. Coming up next, evening wear. Come on. Hurry up. We have to get ready for evening wear. What's the difference between your penis and your Christmas bonus? - What? - Your wife will blow your bonus. Get away from me. Jane here was an unexpected addition to tonight's collection. She works in equities, right? Yeah. - That a problem? - No, just asking. Same rules? Same rules. It is not so bad. They're all bark and no bite. I was taken here last year. They won't hurt you. - They did this to you? - Mmm-hmm. You should have done something. Told the board, emailed shareholders, or the press. - Something, anything. - It wouldn't have mattered. You know how many emails they get the next day? As long as the numbers hold, no one cares how David celebrates the Purge. I do. Anya, this is beyond awful. Jane, you are going to be fine. Look where I am. I played the game, and I got the corner office. Game? Yes. It's easier if you close your eyes. The time will go by really fast. And then you'll get the corner office too. Anya, don't walk away from... Anya. Anya. There's a card in my back pocket. I need you to get it. I just need you to make a phone call. Please. In my pocket. They're called the Matron Saints. Call them. Okay? Anya... I know a place. We can get there, we can stay the rest of the night. - You okay? - I'm fine. What do you want? A thank you would be nice. That or a Purple Heart. I didn't ask you to come here. What did you think would happen, Pen, when you sent that letter? I mean, seriously, what the hell is wrong with you? You don't get to say that. You don't know what I've been through. And you don't know what I've been through. How many people did you kill? I'm a marine. I just follow orders. I meant tonight. I did what I had to do. You didn't give me a choice. Oh, so this is all my fault? I'm not saying it's your fault, Pen. - I can handle myself, Miguel. - Yeah, how's that working out for you? Pen, wait. Wait, look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. I'm just... If I hadn't come, you know what would have happened? Yeah, I do. And I know you don't get it, but that's what I wanted. Pen, Jesus... Tavis has a message I believed in. - She brainwashed you. - She took care of me when no one else was there. She hustled you. - If Mom and Dad were listening to this... - Stop, just stop it, okay? I know that you hate me for it, but I was ready. I wanted to see them. I wanted to go home. Pen, you think I hate you? You're the most important person in the world to me. - I will do anything for you. - I'm not asking for that. - I know. But I can't help it. - Stop treating me like a kid. Pen! Lay him down, light him up. Come on, let's go. I don't think you're going to need stitches, so that's good. That's great. Let's just make sure this doesn't get infected. They must've been planning this for months. I can't believe Catalina was a part of it. I tried to find you, I knocked and knocked. How did you get out? That bedroom has a private library attached to it. That's where I used to go in high school when I had to get away from my parents. I felt the explosion. Thought I could hide. They started searching the upstairs bedrooms, shooting anyone they found. Lila, it's okay, you don't have to relive it. Maybe it'll help to get it out. If she wants. I ran out, there were so many bodies. They didn't see you? There were other guests. He was distracted. God, I must've gotten so lucky. I don't know. I... I never looked back. I came out through the basement and ran all the way here. Let's get you in the shower, it'll help. There you go, my friend. Bingo. You'll have her next. The perks of being the boss. It's one thing to see a painting in a museum. It's quite another to hold it in your hands. - Exquisite. - You're a rapist. Don't be so dramatic. - You're kidding me. - I'm putting on the heels. That's not what we decided on. I know, but this is what everyone wears in finance. Not you. Go on and take the blazer off. Mom, these people that I'm meeting with, they're from a different world. Where it's all about degrees. And recommendations. Internships. That's what gets their attention. Not... Not this. Let me guess, these people you're meeting with, they're all men? This right here? This is your life. Take it in. You need this job, baby. We both do. Don't even start. - That is a mistake. You need to stand out. - I'm going to stand out. For my achievements. - All the other stuff is bullshit. - Don't be naive. The world's not going to change just because you want it to. The world is changing. I want to be a part of that. Look, can you at least wait until we're secure before you go rocking the boat? No, Mom. I can't. Jane. Please. You're making this weird. You know I am never going to recover from this. Last summer I killed a deer out on the Cape, plowed right into it, went straight through the windshield. And what I still remember is not the glass shattering or the screeching or the blood everywhere. It was the eyes. I could see its eyes filled with fear, when it finally understood that its life would never, never ever be the same. Like yours, right now. Not even Caravaggio could capture your eyes. You know why? Because fear is alive. What the hell is going on? Guess it's about to get pretty kinky. Shut up, Spencer. That wasn't planned. Nick, check the breaker and make sure we're still on lockdown. Everybody, just relax. Nobody move. Oh, God. Oh, God. I said nobody move. I don't even know if my parents want to be buried or cremated. Oh, God. Lila. You don't need to worry about that right now. Okay? Just rest. That's all you need to do. Everything in the house, it's all... I can't go back there. You don't have to. Where am I gonna go? You can stay right here. As long as you need to. Okay? Thank you. Get some rest. Let us know if you need anything, okay? - What is it? - Come here. - What? - Something's not adding up. Okay. Lila said there were a bunch of men looking for her in her room, right? Yeah? But when she ran out, he was looking the other way. So? So she changed her story. She just went through hell, Rick. You really want to grill her on the pronouns? What does it matter? Because, what... What if... What if she's leaving something out on purpose. Like what? Like... Like maybe she made some kind of deal with them. With the people who tried to kill her? You know, she's very convincing when she needs to be. What if she'd led them straight to our house? You are being paranoid. Catalina let us go. I just think Lila's hiding something. - Oh, Jesus fuck! - All right. Ross, what the fuck? I told you not to park in front of my house. - Did I tell you that? - Jesus, Ross. All this over parking? No, it's not. This is about neighborly courtesy. Oh, is that what you call training your dog to shit on our lawn? That was after you cut down my maple tree. It was an accident. Ross, we talked about this. It was on the property line, and our gardener thought it was... Oh, there you go. Blame the gardener. Real classy. Ross, Ross, we'll re-do the garage, so that... That Jenna and I can both park inside there. It's problem... Problem solved. Well, no, no. It... You're saying that now. We should have done this a long time ago. You're absolutely right. But money... Money has been... Money has been very tight. Please, don't... Don't... Don't do this. We promise. We'll make a difference. But I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm not breaking any laws. What about human decency? Yeah, what about that? What about decency? Twenty-five years next to the O'Briens. They were good people. Stop it. Stop it, Ross. She's pregnant. I'm glad that you came back for me. And that you're alive. Look, I know I messed up. I don't mean to treat you like a kid. All right? Dad told me to protect you. That was the last thing that he said to me. Come on, let's go. Penelope! Hang on, hang on. Right here. Here, just grab my arm! Grab my arm! Run, Miguel, please. Save yourself. Relax. Stay calm. I can fix this. Shit. Hang tight. I can fix this. Miguel, they're getting closer. It's okay, right, here we go. Pull the rope. Grab it. Hang on. Let go, let go. Come on, let's go. Come on. This is my right. Ross, you're a good man. I've heard you in the yard with your... Your little nephews. This isn't you. Right? Yeah, yeah, because you know me so well? You've lived here a year, you've not invited us over once. We'll change that. We'll change that. You and Carol. - Pick a date. - Pick a date? No. I'm not picking a date. You shouldn't even be living here you... You self-centered, I don't know, yuppie assholes. Ross, please, I know you need to tell yourself that to go through with this, okay? But that's not true. Yes, we have made mistakes, but we will fix them. We promise. Please don't do this. Let us make this right. Hey, fuck you. Fuck you. No, because if it's not the parking, it's going to be a million other things. I know you. And in this country, you can't make your neighbor move. But you can Purge. - Hey! - Hey, Jenna! Jenna, Jenna, Jenna. No, no, no, no, please, please don't. Come here, come here. No, no, no, no. You shouldn't be lifting things. We're selling the house. - And... And give this prick what he wants? - We are selling the house. We're having a baby. Her nursery was supposed to be right there. And it can't be there now. Because every time I come in here to feed her or rock her or sing her to sleep, all I'll be thinking about is how we killed our neighbor. And her tiny little body will be able to sense it. Okay. Yeah. Whatever you want. We'll sell the house. Good. Get this out of my sight. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm here to help you. Come on. - We should hurry. - Anya, get off your ass. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. We'll take care of it tomorrow, all right? My dad... He's the one who saved me. He's the reason I'm here. I was in the library. They'd almost broken in, and then I heard my father's voice. He was yelling, just trying to get their attention. Screaming at them to kill him. That's what distracted them. And I... I crawled out of that room, and I saw him fighting all those men. Fighting them for me. And I didn't do anything. I didn't help him. I just ran. My whole life, he's been the villain and I've been the good one. I really thought that. Hell, I'm the one saving the world, right? But when it came to saving my own family, I... I didn't even try. Lila. You saved us. We owe you everything, Lila. It's going to be okay, right? Of course. We'll all be okay. Jane. Jane. Jane. There's nothing left to say, David. - I'm currently seeing... - All right. Double-checked all the rooms. No one else is inside. What happens now? There's only a few hours left. We'll ride this out. - Yeah. - Together. I mean after. We'll figure that out. For now just, um... Just rest. I'm just gonna close my eyes for a sec. You can, um... You can sleep in the guest room if you'd like. I'll stay up. Can I stay down here? I don't want to be alone right now. Yeah, sure. Thank you. The place I told you about, it's this way. They got pancakes. Okay, I don't actually know if they have pancakes. Not my problem. You promised. I didn't technically promise. Oh, I'm sorry, do you have to say I promise for it to be a promise? Touché. Where are we going? Somewhere safe. The Purge is your chance to rise up. To stand tall and reclaim your power. So rise. Slay your oppressors. On Purge Night, the exploited, the persecuted, the broken, will all rise up together and march hand-in-hand to victory.
