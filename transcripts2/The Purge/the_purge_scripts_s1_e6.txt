 Previously on The Purge. Bracka? I'm Jane from the email. No contact from this point on. You'll get a text when it's done. I've done something terrible and I can't be responsible for another person's death. I have to stop it. You need to leave this house. Open the door, Lila. Please. No. We need to hide, Jenna. We need to hide. No Stanton is safe tonight. Stop! Miguel, Stop!

 I loved you so much. Once I Purge, all this anger will be gone. Don't let him get away! Miguel? He's mine. If you see something, do something. Become the person tonight that you want to be tomorrow. Joey! Hey, Steve, I'm sorry. Ike, do you mind? - Hey, Joe. - Morning, Pops. - So? - This guy. How'd it go? You got another date coming up? Huh? Go on, just... You know, you call her up,

 you ask her to dinner, and you take her some place nice. Can we talk about this later? Ah, you're finally getting back out there, you know? Putting the bachelor life behind you. Enough, Pops. - What? - She didn't show. Okay. I had a burger and left. That's it. Eh, stop wallowing. Just... You get back out there, you try again. I mean, it's like this place, right? You put in your time, show your worth. Look, you're a provider, Joey. All right? Any girl worth a damn would be crazy to pass that up. Don't wallow. Let's see what you got, tough guy! Let's go. Let's go. I'm in so bad shape. What is that? What are those? Trick or treat! We're coming for you, pretty boy. Come on. Keep running. We're almost there. Marco! - Come on, work. Come on. - Polo! - Come on. - Rick, open it! I'm trying, I'm trying. Go! Go, go, go, go, go. You can run, but you can't hide! Oh, God. They can't get in. Don't worry. Hey. Hey, it's okay. We're safe. It's over. No, it isn't. We've got a real Vietnam War tent - straight out of Saigon. - Uh, tie him up right over there. With working rifles. Come on, let's go! - Give me the key. - Take it easy, buddy. Thank you. Oh, wow. This is... So, I'm guessing this wasn't, uh, the homecoming that you kind of expected, huh? Fuck you. Oh. Look at you. Do whatever you want to me, but she doesn't deserve this. No, no, no, no, no. She deserves a lot worse. - Don't hurt him, please. - Shut up. I will do whatever I goddamn want because it's my right to Purge. Hello? David, are you here? David? Jane? Is everything all right? What on Earth are you doing outside? I'm sorry. I know it's late. Well, no. I tried to call. I kept calling, and you never answered, David. Yes, well, after we closed our deal, I did a bit of celebrating. I must not have heard the phone, so... Come in. You, uh... You're all right? Sorry, I... I'm sorry. I didn't know what else to do. Do about what, Jane? I'm... I'm confused. I don't understand. - David, I made a decision about tonight... - Actually, you know, Jane. Please, allow me to apologize for making you work tonight. Clearly, a woman of your stature should have been at home with her family, so I'm sorry. Thank you. I appreciate that. Anyway, uh... What's on your mind? This place is secure, right? Of course. State-of-the-art Sandin Security. Why? Were you expecting someone? David, someone's coming to kill you. Lockdown initiated, Mr. Ryker. Sector One, secure. When did you know? What are you talking about? When did you know that they were going to attack? - I... - You looked right at me, and then you left and went to her. I wanted to make sure you were both safe. But you didn't, did you? You left, and you didn't come back. Jenna, where are you going? We're not done here. Please pick up. Please pick up. Hi, it's Lila. You know what to do. Do you still love her? Can we not... Can we not right now? No. Answer me. - It doesn't matter. - It does to me. I... No, I don't. - I don't know. - I can't believe you. Do you know why I went to that party tonight? Why I was sucking up to all those assholes? Because we need that deal. Not just me. You do too. - You really believe that? - Yes, you're goddamn right. Jenna, I know how important it is to you to start giving something back. To do some good for a change. And I want that too. I mean, we were 12 hours away from changing everything, so I closed my eyes and I started counting down. - And where the hell were you? - Where was I? - I was right there. - Bullshit. - You were upstairs trying to find... - Shut up! Just shut up, Rick. Just... Please, for one second and listen to me. I saw something tonight. Something I hoped wasn't true. And it's been building... I've watched it happen for a while. And then the moment you touched that gun... I saw your face. And I knew. Tonight wasn't about me. And it wasn't about us. Tonight was all you. Look what you were willing to do. I did what I had to do to provide for this family. Jesus Christ, Rick, you almost shot a man! Listen, I would've pulled the trigger if I had to, Jenna. I will do anything for this family. So that she doesn't have to eat shit the way I did. Hearing kids call her "white trash." Buying groceries with food stamps, or clothes at Goodwill. That shit is in my bones. And I won't go back, all right? I'll do whatever it takes. Don't act like I'm some spoiled brat. I didn't grow up like them. No, but you didn't grow up like me. That's it. That's it, isn't it? You got something to prove. But not to me. To yourself. Getting that deal done, it somehow means that you've... You've made it. I just don't like the person it makes you. Ever since we met Stanton, I've watched the man I fell in love with turn into something that scares me. Yeah? Is that why you left me there? To die? Because you were scared? It wasn't so you could just run off - with your girlfriend? - Rick! Rick, you are not listening to me. It's not about Lila. It's about you. I miss the person who would've done anything to protect his family from those people tonight. Not become one of them. That's the man I love. That's the man I miss. Jen... Whoo! You still with me? Whoa. Don't die on me yet, buddy. Okay. Hmm. What are you doing here? You wrote me. Yeah, to say goodbye. I can't keep fighting, Miguel. I can't... This night has taken everything. I just want to see Mom and Dad. They're not ready to see you yet, all right? They want you here with me. - Miguel... - Pen... Okay. All right. Enough. Shall we? You can have me. But let my brother go. - Pen. - I'm trying to save your life. If you give in, then I give up. And I'll be right behind you. That's really sweet. But sorry, no deal. I'm gonna Purge both of you. I should've killed you when I had the chance. You probably should have, but you know, hindsight being 20/20, that makes sense. More like 10/10. You know... For the longest time, all I did was... Was think about killing you both. I went over it, like, a thousand different times in my head. And I imagined what the world would feel like without you in it, and eventually, it just got... It just felt right. Don't fucking touch her. You know, we're not that different, you and me. Yeah? How's that? Well, we, uh, we both kill because the government says that it's okay. "Hoo-rah, motherfucker, hoo-rah!" All right, you ready? Man, I gotta know. Who are you? All that matters right now is that we get you inside. Man, I know you. - I don't think so. - Yeah, I do. You remember those little candies? Fruity and mint? Fruity? You know the ones I'm talking about? - Life Savers? - Exactly. That's what you are, man. Can you walk? A goddamn Life Saver, man. I got you. Hey, listen up! We get the Lost Horse shipment finished today, first round's on me! Next round's on you, right? Come on. I'll see you later. J.J., can I get one? Good day today. Tell me you don't think she's your friend. Are you drunk already? Now, you listen to me, all right? She's management. So, by definition, the enemy. I'm gonna get you a cab. She... She may smile at you, but she's the goddamn Grim Reaper. Hey, J.J., can you get him a ride? You got it. Hey... Did you call a doctor about that? I will. Next week. I will tomorrow. Come on, you have to have somebody take a look at that. I'm fine, Joey. Thirty years on the line breathing shit, what do you expect? We have good union insurance. That's what it's there for. I better hurry up and use it before we go under, right? We're not going anywhere. Saticoy's been there for 50 years. Grandpa helped build the place. We make stuff that lasts. Nothing lasts forever. I mean, sure, that wheel will keep turning - until they find a cheaper way to make it! - Okay. Hey, rise and shine. Say goodnight to John, everyone. We're dinosaurs, Joey. And that meteor... That meteor is coming. It's coming. Look, I see what this night has done to me. And I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I got lost trying to make sure that... That our baby's parents don't have to struggle the way that mine did. All right, but that's not an excuse, you're right. I don't need any of it. I just need you. You're my home, Jen. Everything else is just wallpaper. - Here, let me. Let me. - No, I got it. You're gorgeous. I'm going to bed. I had a dream the other night, we were holding her. She opened her eyes for the first time. And suddenly, she became a person. And she... She looked at me and it was the most incredible thing I've ever seen in my entire life. And you... You gave me her and I held her and I... I started crying. She just fit so perfectly. It was like... My arms were designed to hold her. And that's all I want. That's all I need. What if I don't believe you? Come here. I love you so much. I could stay right here and be happy. But you want to keep going. Until when? When is it enough? - I don't know. - I know you want to provide. And I do, too. But for me, that means knowing when you have more than enough to be happy. What I saw tonight, the excess, the privilege? Nothing is worth ending up like that. All that matters is who you are and who you're with. I don't want to lose you. Okay, I'll... I'll do whatever it takes. Then stop climbing, or you will. So first, I'm gonna take your eye. And then I'm gonna take your sister. But before you bleed out, you're gonna see all of that. Well... Or half of it, at least. Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho. - So then get on with it. - Okay. Oh. You know when the, uh... When the cornea bursts, you'll see the most spectacular colors. So enjoy that. Because after that, it's all black. You have any last words? Yeah. You missed a spot. The key. Your time is almost up. You can purchase more time at the ticket kiosk. Miguel? Your time is almost up. You can purchase more time at the ticket kiosk. Good job, there's a live one. I'm actually impressed, Miss Barbour. To be honest, I... I really didn't think you had it in you. You don't understand. This woman, she's still out there. She's on her way here. Oh, I understand. You paid for my murder. Which is your right under the law. And I have to live with that. But she not going to stop until it's done. Is... Is your family upstairs? My family's in Paris. Okay. We have to get ready. - Now. - I admire you. For coming here tonight, risking your life for mine. Hell, I even applaud the initiative. Though I'm not quite sure the board would approve your promotion even with me out of the picture. Which was your objective, right? Oh, I've watched you waste your potential year after year after year, wondering when you would reach out and start taking what was rightfully yours. How rewarding it must feel to finally do something about it, huh? It's not, believe me. It's a brutal fucking world out there, isn't it, Jane? Do you have a gun? Mmm. - Of course I do. - Get it. I'll stay here until she comes. I'll make sure she calls it off. She? You really hired a woman to do this, huh? Well, nobody's getting in here, Miss Barbour. They can't. Not without my permission. So what do you say? How about a tour? You've got nothing to worry about, I can assure you. It's totally safe. And as a fellow art history buff, I've got a few pieces that I think you're really gonna love. Come on. After you. Okay. Miguel! Miguel, hurry up! Stop hitting him. Stop, stop. It's wrong! No! It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's okay. He's not gonna hurt you anymore. He's not gonna hurt you. He's not gonna hurt you anymore. He's dead. Come on. You all right? We gotta move. Let's go. Grab his jacket. Quick. Quick. I... Okay. Quick, Pen, go. - Quick. - All right, all right. Time's up. Please exit the witch tent now. - Thank you. - Shut up. You're next. Please exit the witch tent now. Come on, we gotta go. Come on, let's go. Yeah, shoot him again! Come on, Lila. Pick up, pick up. Lila! Bring the dogs. Bring her upstairs. Lila! Lila! She's dead. This building originally housed one of the first daily papers here in the city. After it went defunct, it stood abandoned for nearly 30 years. It's right here, to the right. It was abandoned for nearly 30 years until I was able to pick it up in an auction. Right around the corner here is one of my favorite pieces. This right here, is an original LeMercier. One of only four he made before he was committed. What do you think? - It's lovely. - Better be. Cost me 600 grand. - David, shouldn't we be... - Yes, no, no, no. There's just one more thing I'd like to show you. It's on the floor below. It's the pièce de résistance. One of the finest collections in the city. And also, there's a full bath and private bedroom. It's all yours until the night is over. Consider it my apology to you for making you work on Purge Night, okay? Come. Don't touch me! Jane, please. Do you really want to spend the rest of the night out on the streets? Jane. Jane. I don't know. I don't know what's over here. Hey, Joe, what's up with this shit? Yeah! Yo, open it up! - Christ. - Eileen! They did it. I told you... The meteor came and they didn't even tell us to duck. Open the goddamn gate. There she comes. So that's it? We're getting the axe? No warning. What about severance? I know that you're all angry. I am too. This isn't easy for anyone. I saw the books. We were out-performing last quarter. What the hell happened? We were, but not at a steady enough rate. This just isn't sustainable. So you pull the plug and send us packing? Forget it, Joe, they got an offer they couldn't refuse. Where are you sending our jobs? Half to Mexico, the other half to the goddamn machines, right? Yeah! Now, I know that some of you have questions. Oh, we got questions. Why don't you question this? - I'm sorry, I... - Oh yeah, "I'm sorry." Sorry doesn't pay our bills. Or health insurance. We have families. What are we supposed to do? It's out of my hands. Bullshit! - I'm sorry. - This is not right. I'm sorry. I told you. The Grim fucking Reaper. Oh, no. Come on. Drama queen, man. Look at you, look. - Am I? - But, what... What is the $14,000 about? He didn't help me with anything. - This was 2015? - This was two thousand... Old Thompson man with no... Hey, you all right? You take your meds? I can't afford the good shit no more. String him up, boys, and go fetch me that little lady! You won't get away with this! Demonstrations erupted in Los Angeles today, as new restrictions were placed on water usage. Congress will convene a special session to resume debate... What is this shit? As we can see here, massive flooding along the coastline. Oh, give me a break. Thank you for joining us. Markets took a major hit today as U. S. Manufacturing continues to decline. Playing one is Zohan, Zohan... That ties it up at the top of the hour... Every day, you show up to your job on time, ready to work. You play by the rules, adhere to the social contract, because you know it's the only way to conduct yourself in a civilized society. And yet, all your hard work and dedication is meaningless. Society screws you over. You get laid off. Your boss won't promote you. Your wife left. Your date stood you up. Over and over, you give, they take. So, now what? It's simple. Don't wallow in disappointment. Embrace the healing powers of violence, and Purge. This year, every year, take charge of your future. I will be your guide. All right, head up. Act like you belong. We should torch this place. Shit. Come, quick! Let us out of here! All right, when I tell you, start running. - Miguel. - And don't stop. - No. - You have a better idea? Yeah. I do. - Pen. - Just trust me. Come on. Going once. Going twice. This woman is sold for 250. And now we have a gentleman who is lean, and of average height. A well-maintained beard. You wanted to blend in, right, so blend. Let's start the bidding at $50. Can I get 50? Thank you, very much. And 75. Right down in the front. How about 100? $100. - One hundred in the back. - Penny? - $200. - OMF Penny? Goddess Penny, what happened? - Let's go. - Penelope! Penelope! Split up and find them before they can get to an exit. They couldn't have gotten far. Move, goddamn it! Let's move. Shit. Come on. Come on! Oh! Oh. Bitch put up a hell of a fight, I'll give you that. But you should never, ever, ever hire a woman to do a man's job. Now, Miss Barbour, I'd love to show you the rest of my collection. Right this way. Looking good. Shh. Mmm, mmm, mmm. You're soft. It's a living, breathing art gallery. You can look and touch, but nothing more. The rules are very strict. There's no penetration, no nudity. And everything happens over the clothes. If all the ladies behave, and keep quiet, they all get to go home in the morning. Jane, when my father founded this company, times were simpler. Men were men and women were not. Then again, he lived by the motto, "no blacks, no broads," so I'm sure you can appreciate how far we've come. Thanks to a steady stream of PC bullshit, everything's become a federal crime. I tell a woman I can't stop thinking about her, she gets bent out of shape, she runs to the Times, I lose my company. I've done nothing wrong and my life is ruined. But not tonight, Jane, not tonight. Tonight... Tonight we don't have to fight it. We can give in and become the men that we once were. Ain't America great? Here, here. Anya here learned how to play the game. Oh, yeah. How do you think she got the corner office? You're pigs. Pigs. This is disgusting. Nobody's being killed here, Miss Barbour. We're not, uh, animals. - What are you then? - We're human beings. Purging, as is our right as Americans. - As men. - You sick son of a bitch. I should have never, ever tried to call it off. But you did, you see. You did. And that's what makes you weak. No! No! No! Get off of me! No! I've got an idea. Come on. Hey, you. Search over there. The cart's going to the tent. Let's go. There! Right there! Get them! Stop. Hands in the air. Penny, here. There they are! Throw this, now. Put your hands up! Hands in the air. Come on! Hey, go up that side, right there! Stop. Hands in the air. You're trapped, like an animal locked in a cage. So, what's the answer? Break free. That's right, "Give me your tired, your poor," "your huddled masses yearning to breathe free." That's on the Statue of Liberty for a reason. Because she's America's symbol of freedom. She holds a torch to help us find our way. That's what I'm offering you. The torch. Now come and take it. Because we're all products of our environment, our upbringing, our history. But the only way to understand who you are, is to recognize where you came from. That's how you'll know what you're capable of becoming. And now for your Purge accu-view weather report, brought to you by PSN, the Purge Home Shopping Network. Now we've got good news for those of you... Lila's dead. Oh, my God. Jenna. I'm so sorry. About everything. God, this night... This night is... She knows what night it is. - Jen, I... - The baby knows. And she hates it. She's just like her mom. You couldn't have saved Lila, you know that, right? You tried, but we barely got out ourselves. And I know how awful you must feel. But... But come on, we have to protect our family. No matter what. Come here. It's okay. I'm hungry. God. Jesus, how am I hungry again? You want me to make you some eggs? Okay. Do you mind if I ask her if she would like to place an order for carry out? Yeah? - One second. - Okay. Um... Mmm. Hey, uh, your mom and I were wondering if you would like some scrambled eggs. She says she would like them over-easy. Really? With bacon. Over-easy with bacon it is. You need anything else? I just want tonight to be over. I know. It almost is. Hmm. Let's go eat. Don't worry, they can't get inside. Help! Help me, please, somebody's coming. Please. Let me in, Rick! Please, help! Please!
