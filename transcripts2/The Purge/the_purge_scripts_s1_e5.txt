 Previously on The Purge. You must have a secret Purge list. I don't. Yeah, what about David? We all see the way you get passed over for partner. It's complete bullshit. You crazy? You pay me here, and we both go to jail. I've changed my mind. I have to cancel my order. Stop! Stop! Get off her.

 - We're the Matron Saints. - Mmm-hmm. We protect the females of this fair nation against the gendercide of Purge. I want you to go back in there and help your sister. Protect her, always. Do not come out until after you hear those sirens again. I found the bus. But she wasn't there. I think someone got her. Start the bidding at an even grand. - Anyone... - I'll double that! - That one's mine. - Sold, for $2,000. It's good to see you again, Penny. - Henry. - It's been a while. I don't think it would make sense for either of us to be alone with her. Rick. Oh, my God. What the fuck?

 We moved on. I'm so glad everything's back to the way it was before I came along. When you two could barely touch each other? You need to leave this house. Why? What's wrong? Get your husband and meet me in the cellar. I don't understand. It's not safe here. What was that about? I wasn't. I... I wasn't feeling great. Earlier. Catalina was just checking on me. I'm sorry to hear that. I take it this is your first time? It's strange... In the beginning. But you'll develop a knack for it. Just follow my lead. Come on, everyone. Time for dessert! Should've seen this guy... Rick. Excuse me, pardon me. Now it's time for your weather report. Hey! Quiet back there. God damn it. Where'd you find them? That's my landlady and her dickhead son. Year after year, they raise my rent. So now it's time for new management. What's gonna happen to them? Never been to the Carnival, kid? All kind of crazy shit. People dropping their savings to live out some fantasy. But, hey, if that's what they want, folks like me will come in and fill the void. Same kind of folks who got my sister. That's the game, kid. We don't make the rules. Maybe the rules need breaking. Take that, you sick predator. I like you. You got heart, I admire that. But that back there is my business. And when you threaten my business, you threaten my livelihood. And I can't have that, you got me? Yeah, I got you. We're good. I know what you're thinking, soldier. And I'm telling you to stand down. And I said we're good. Just take me to the Carnival. Yes, sir. You should see the other guy. That's not funny, dumb-ass. You can't keep doing this. Why not? He had it coming. Why not? Because we're running out of peas. These work better because they adjust to your face. Shit. I can't get grounded again. I need you to tell them that I was defending your honor or something. We already used that last time. I'll think of something else. You're my favorite sister. You're an idiot. Don't tell me that's Henry. Penelope, come on, really? You don't even know him. He sells dope from the towers. Well, I don't need your permission. You're not Dad. No. No! Help! Somebody help. - Please get me away from this monster. - You burn! Please, no. Please, no, stop. Let me go! Please, no. Please help me. Please. Henry, no. Please, no. Step right up, step right up. Take your pick. Seven hours left in this year's Carnival of Flesh, so hurry up and join the fun. I know this really isn't my old apartment. But you know, it'll do, right? I actually... I... I rented this out for the hour. I, uh, I was actually planning on somebody else. But I... I mean, look at this. The night, it... It brought us back together. Isn't... I found you. Bygone accepts cash, checks or Bitcoin. You know, I missed you. Did you miss me? No. No, Henry. I said, did you miss me? I'm not supposed to be here. I'm not supposed to be here. Really? Really? So where... Where should you be? There's so much that I didn't get to tell you. All martyrs must be Purged tonight. No exceptions. But now I can. Go to hell. Oh, look around. This is hell. It's okay. It's okay. I'm so sorry. Come on, David. Come on, come on. - The voicemail you... - Oh, God, this isn't happening. Everything okay? No, I really need to get going. My friend, he's... He's waiting for me. These things don't take long. - We're good at what we do. - Uh-huh. This friend you keep mentioning, is this a friend-friend or a boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. So it's a Purge Night booty call. No. It's not like that, he's... Did you know that Purge Night has the second highest conception rate of the year, after New Year's Eve? Lot of people out there with a screw loose I guess. Two of my kids were conceived on Purge Night. I... I didn't mean to offend you. I'm not offended. We rescued Marge three years ago. Jesus, I'm so sorry. Don't be. I've healed. I'm better. My ex-husband... Feel sorry for that sack of shit. Why, what happened? Let's just say, we adjusted his attitude. And his face. Marge can be a little intense. Her story is so awful. But now she's stronger for it. We're all survivors here. Including you. Don't forget that. Thank you. Thank you all for being here tonight. But really, where would you rather be? Seriously, as I look out at this remarkable crowd, I'm reminded how fortunate I am. Successes, I've had a few. But I'd like to take a moment to cast the spotlight on another wonderful achievement of my life. My wife, Eleanor. The real star of the evening. Yes. To Eleanor. She has worked tirelessly planning this party to perfection and tonight is a testament to her hard work and dedication to our cause, replenishing the New Founding Fathers' war chest. That's right. We hold the keys to success. Seriously, I have them. I'll show them to you later. We can make a difference. Because when the NFFA thrives, we thrive. Now, as tribute to a very successful year, we're spoiling you with not one, not two, but three offerings. Yes. We apologize, they have not been sanitized for your protection. Our staff will hand out your weapons. Each one has been handcrafted. Blessed be America, a nation reborn. Blessed be us, a future more prosperous. Blessed be America. A nation reborn. A future more prosperous. Hey, how'd you sleep? You dream about me? Don't touch me. Okay, that's... That's the Penny I know. Always fighting. Yeah, you know, Even... Even when I gave you a home. You gave me drugs. You ruined my life with that shit. I gave you what you wanted. I let you live. And what do you do? You break my heart so you can join a fucking cult. What do you want to listen to? Whatever you want. I don't know. Come on. Come on, I'm taking requests. Something fun? Yeah, okay, that narrows it down. You got this place to yourself? Yeah, yeah. It's pretty sweet, right? Yeah, it's sick. Um... Um, is it... Are you... Are you cool with this? Yeah, sure. Totally. Yeah? You want some? Nah, I'm good. Afraid your big brother is going to flip out on you or something? He knows I can handle myself. No, yeah, I know. Miguel's right about that. But, man, he's like, so wired. I feel like you look at him wrong for like two seconds, he wants to kill you. He's just angry. I get it. So am I. No, you're sad. There's a difference. You don't know what we've been through. No, yeah, you're right. Sorry. I... I don't. Yeah, I can't imagine. And, uh, I know it's not really the same thing, but, uh... But my parents are gone too. They're... No, they... I mean, they might as well be. They, uh, they got locked up trying to jack a grocery store. But, I mean, even if they do get out, I really don't want anything to do with them. I got my own life, you know? I got... Got big plans. Do you? Yeah, damn right. Like what plans? I don't know. Like, I got places to see. I got things to do. - That narrows it down. - Nice. Um, so, I got this book for Christmas when I was a kid. And it has all the national parks in the country. And so I'm gonna... I'm gonna go to all of them. You should come with me. Sorry, I don't mean like, right now. I don't. Um... Don't worry about it. Um, no, but I... I gotta save up a little bit and then, uh, I'm gonna go. I want to kind of get this big camper and just like, jam it full of food and just drive. You're really pretty. Thank you. What's it like? What, that? Uh, I don't... I don't like, do it that often. I... Just every once in a while to relax. Um, but, uh... I guess it just, uh, it just kind of... Makes the edges a little softer. It's okay. Once I Purge, all this anger will be gone. I won't have to see you in my head every night. And you can finally stop fighting. I hate you. I hope you die. You know, I never, uh, I never went on that road trip. To all those parks, I thought about it after you left, but... Maybe next year. I'll camp in Yosemite, and I can... I can sleep under the stars. And if it gets cold, I can build a fire. Yee-haw. We're here. Look alive back there. Time for your weather report, brought to you by PHM. Purge Home Shopping Network. We're expecting some light showers in the early morning hours, so don't... It's okay. I'm not going to hurt you. What the hell are you doing? I need him alive to get where I'm going. Well, what do we do now? Find a spot. Hole up till the morning. You're... You're just going to leave us? Hunker down and you'll make it. Give us the truck. - Joshie, what are you doing? - Just shut up, Ma. I know what I'm doing. We're taking the truck. Do not ever turn on someone who just saved your ass. What do we do now? Run. Find a triage van. Go! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Purge and purify! Lila? Lila, it's me. Lila, I know you can hear me. Look, what Rick said... It's not true. But none of that matters now. I think something's about to happen. We need to get out of here. Open the door, Lila. Please. In for a penny, in for a pound. That's a hell of a show you're putting on here. Where's that clever wife of yours? Well, uh, you know, she needed to take a... A little... Like, a little break from the excitement. - I like her. - Good. She's got this verve you need to watch out for. All right, well, go tell her to stop being such a grouch and come join the party. Because there are a few more surprises that you are not going to want to miss. - Okay. - All right? And then you and me, we still need to talk about you joining the New Founding Fathers, because there are plenty of other investors to meet. Yeah, great. To new partnerships. - Go get her. - Yeah. Give me your key card. Wait. This damn thing's been acting up all night. Go on. Leave your gun in the truck. Lying bitch! Go, go, move! We've got about 30 seconds before he's back up. You think you have the right to do whatever you want tonight, huh? It's the law. Oh, my God. The Purge is not the law. It's the absence of law. And when our government fails us, it's our mission to protect those who can't protect themselves. By any means necessary. Nice haul, kid. He looks robust. For the auction. Have fun! Maybe I messed up, okay? I loved you so much. I was nothing without you, Penny. I would have done anything to keep you. And what do you do? You just... You just walk away. You walk away and you never look back. - No, stop. Come on, stop. - Get away from me, Henry. I just want to talk to you. Okay? Just stop. Okay? I love you so much, please. Please, I'll never... I'll never do it again. - Please, just get back... - Fuck you. See, like, I love you and I don't want to do this to you! Stop, Miguel, you're gonna make it worse. You want to fuck with me? - Henry, stop! - Come on, bro! Stop it! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! My head! Stop! Miguel, stop! Stop, Miguel, you're going to kill him! Look at him. You're going to go to jail for this. You betrayed me. You broke me. And then you left me. You were already broken. I just didn't want to wait around for you to fix it. I'm done being scared. I won't let you hurt me anymore. You can't break me because I am stronger than you are. All you can do is kill me. Everyone thinks this night will solve all their problems. But it can't. It won't. It doesn't solve anything. It just makes everything worse. So kill me. That's what you want, right? Then your problems will go away? Go ahead. I surrender. But I'm not the victim. You are. We just need to clean you up. Oh, my God. Madelyn. You need to see this. It's nothing. Really. It... Uh-huh. Right. It's always nothing. Because even when we're the victims, we've been taught to conceal and protect men. You're only enabling him when you carry that shame alone. Let's get her out of here. Wait. Where are you taking me? Some place safe where he can't hurt you. Come on, let's go. - Shut up! - Thank you. I'll never let you hurt me again. And now, the cleanup. Uh, is this necessary? We don't enjoy this part, but, yeah, it's necessary. Once he's marked, all women will know he's a violent animal. And every time he looks in the mirror, he'll remember tonight. Okay, that doesn't make it right. You don't need to do this. - You don't think he deserves this? - No, Jesus. I'm saying that there's a better way. A legal way. Oh, God. Laws change and evolve based on the whims of men. Sometimes we move one step forward, sometimes, three steps back. We're ready. Join us. I couldn't live with myself. No. Funny. Because we sleep better at night knowing who our enemies are. - Madelyn, I am telling you, you're... - Stop it. Going to regret this. - You don't have to... - She misses? We'll have to do it again. Hold still. That's right, take it. Take it. I'm leaving. Oh! Oh, shit. What are you doing? You know it's not safe out there. I have to go. I've done something terrible and after everything, I... I can't be responsible for another person's death. I have to stop it. Then at least take this. Call the number. We'll come marching in. Thank you. Hold. Move. Hey. Move on. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. You got the wrong guy. Another word out of you and you get the stick. Listen to me, God damn it. - What's the problem here? - There's been a breach. Oh, shit. That's Rex. He's a Collector. Get him out of there. Move. This way. The show is about to begin. Miguel? Dale? What are you doing home? I'm on leave. What the hell are you doing? Purging one day a year keeps me on point the other 364. Try it out, brother. We're soldiers. We don't hurt civilians. No, this ain't for me, brother. All right. I can't talk right now, Ma. The nurses said you called while I was asleep. It was nothing, Ma. Go back to bed. Now look, I know you didn't call me to say nothing. Spit it out. What's the matter? Jane, I don't have time for this, baby. What's wrong? - I'm... - Hmm? Jane. I'm sorry, Mom. I... - I just wanted to let you know... - What? I just wanted to let you know that no matter what happens... Whatever happens... That I love you. Baby, what's wrong? Jane? What is this? Rick. Rick, listen to me. We need to leave, we need to get out... Wait, shh. You hear that? Those gunshots are really close. Come on. Oh, my God. It's fine. It's fine. The Stantons have the best security ever. Oh, Jesus. What? - Lila! Open the door! - Whoa, whoa! No, no, no, no. We need to hide, Jenna. We need to hide. The cellar. - What? - You have to trust me. Quick, come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Ahhh! Ahhh! You can't hide from us! David? It's me, Jane. Safety, compromised. Access nearest available panic room. This way. Safety, compromised. Access nearest available panic room. Go, go, go, go, go. - Okay. - We need to keep moving here. Which way? Okay, okay. - Which way, which way, which way? - Let's go this way. There, there, there, there. Come on. Come on. Come on! We need to go back. We need to go back. I wouldn't do that. Safety, compromised. Access nearest available panic room. You're one of them. Sometimes revolution is the only way to make the world a better place. Please. We're not with them. We're not NFFA. I know. We have roadblocks on Walnut and Spruce. Go across Franklin. You'll be safe on the other side. Thank you. Lila. She's not one of them either. - Please, help her. - Jenna, come on, baby, we gotta go. No Stanton is safe tonight. Come on. Go, go! Come with me! Let's get them! Death to the NFFA! Let's go! Get them! Don't let them get away! Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul. The giving is here. The Invisible awaits. - Purify my flesh... - Shut up. Shut up! - Prepare my soul. - Shut up! - The giving is here. - Shut up! It's him! Grab him! Penelope! - Come on. - Get up. - Penelope! Pen! - Surrender! Miguel? Penelope. Yo, he's mine. Pay before play. Carnival rules. No. No. Let him go. It's me you want, Henry. Yeah, no. I'll pay whatever it takes. Hey. Group therapy begins in five minutes. How're you feeling? Group therapy begins in five minutes. You were always telling me to stop fighting. But now I'm getting paid to do it. What are you doing here? Pen, I'm leaving. I know. I might not be coming back. You knew. One more strike and that would be it. They'd take you away and I would be all alone. - You're not alone. - I am now. - We can talk... - Miguel, you're going to war. I'll send you money for your own place. - I'll make this right, I promise. - How? By leaving? Or by never coming back? I love you. I'll be back real soon. Okay? - I can't miss my bus. - Just go. Goodbye, Pen. Penelope Guerro? Hi, my name is Tavis. I'm a social worker. I'm here to talk to you, if you want. Was that your brother? I can tell. He loves you more than anything in this world. And believe it or not, he's in more pain than you are. Sometimes it's hard to be strong for the people we love. But it's always the ones we love the most who can break our hearts the easiest. If you see something, do something. Because a storm is coming. When the rains come and sink this rock, will you sink or will you swim? Drown or fight your way to shore? What will you choose? I know what I think you should do. Be a hero. Step up. Put out that fire. Become the person tonight that you want to be tomorrow. I'll have your face! Oh, you guys want to see bad ass? Come on, get over here, Batman.
