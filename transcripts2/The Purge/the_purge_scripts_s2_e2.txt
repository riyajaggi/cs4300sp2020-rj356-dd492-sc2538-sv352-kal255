 No. Sirens. His foot's on private property after the siren, - so that makes it an off-Purge crime. - _ - I'll see you after. - Really hope so. Where'd he go? He was right here. What? What is it? He was targeting me. Should you be watching this? - Something's off. I can feel it. - _ _ _ Okay. - Shut up. - It's over.

 Purge is over. You can't hurt me anymore. You can't do shit! You want to see if that's true? - No. - Start running. Ladies. Ah, shit. Medical professionals are advising citizens not to touch any dead bodies, as they are a health hazard. Risk of disease and infection are a real threat, so please allow the proper authorities to dispose of all human remains. _ Oh! Shit. - Sorry. - There you go. Thank you. So who is this guy? Did you find anything about him yet? No, I don't know who he is. There's nothing on the phone. I'll ask the neighbors. Maybe they saw someone prowling around last week. No, do not talk to the neighbors. Well, we need to do something. We can't let him get away with this. Honey, there are people that we can hire. You know, the Cartwrights... they got someone after Nick got Purged. They found the attacker and returned the favor. But you would never Purge anyone. Okay, you are not that kind of person. Well, honey, maybe I'm changing. We almost died last night... and everything is different now. We need to know who did this. But whatever happens, I will keep you safe. I promise. All right? No! Morning. Just put out some fresh coffee. How much sleep did you get? Almost none. Estimates came in already. 30% uptick from last year in every district. Oh, thank you. - What now? - Are you okay? Uh, I'm just tired. What numbers are you talking about? Biggest Purge in city history. Way more finish line fuck-ups too, so it's gonna be a big day. I need you to close up all of last night's files ASAP, make room for new cases. Okay. You're the best. _ _ I need to see a doctor! My son needs to see a doctor! - Step back. - Okay. Excuse me. Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Somebody help her! Please, someone! - Nurse Alex. - Dr. Moore. We got way more Purge patients this year. My son would never do that! She isn't even bleeding anymore. I need you to get her in the room, stat. - Thank you. - Are you serious? Are you serious? Doctor, please! Doctor! Whoa, are you all right? - Why are you late? - I'm fine. Excuse me. No! No! Please! Please! Miss, clean-up crew is on the way. You don't want to see that. Can you tell me your name? You go to school here? Did you Purge anyone? Hey, what happens on Purge Night stays on Purge Night, but I did get pictures of the suicide bridge as proof. Turner. What happened? Are you all right? Yeah. Where is Ben? We got separated. Kelen, I don't think he made it. Oh, my God. - What happened? - Hey, babe. You need to go to the hospital. That's not my blood. Hey, man. I'm glad you're okay. Thanks for breakfast. Guys, what the hell happened last night? We got jumped. It was scary, but it turned out okay. God, I hate this holiday. You look exhausted. - You should get some sleep. - I'm fine. Let me get cleaned up and I'll... I'll meet you back here. I'm not gonna hurt you. Hello, Mr. Grant. I'm sorry this is late. Should take care of the rest of the year. - Something wrong? - I know how you got this.

From work. ♪ Yet should you find ♪ ♪ The honest kind ♪ - ♪ Rejoice ♪ - What's wrong? Uh, Tommy. It's always Tommy. He screwed up, and I had to let him go, and I'm wondering if that was the right move. What do you do when every choice you can make seems like the wrong one? No, no, not those. These are the good ones. Hmm? I'm sure that you did the best that you could. ♪ Songs are sung ♪ ♪ Of love without ♪ Tell me your name again. ♪ But should you find ♪ Ryan. ♪ Rejoice, give thanks ♪ My boy's named Ryan. I know, Mama. ♪ The honest kind ♪ ♪ Rejoice ♪ ♪ Give thanks by ♪ Why did this happen? It doesn't make sense. I thought we weren't pursuing this? Well, I may have found a reason to. This is where it started. They chased her out of her house. Look. - _ - So... what? That's the professor looking out the window. She saw them coming. And she ran out just in time. Just in time. What was she doing? It took over a minute to get out the back. Two armed men in masks breaking into your door on Purge Night? You don't take your time. Something else happened. This wasn't random. Okay, so is there a security camera inside of her house we could tap? No, but her cell phone was on... And she had a registered smart TV, so I'm gonna select the devices registered to that location, start downloading, and we wait. I need to know what happened in that house. - What we got? - Gunshot. Clean entry and exit. No major artery. That is some good luck. But we still have to clean it, but you're gonna be fine. Just breathe. Sir? Nurse, I need some pressure bandages. On it, Dr. Moore. - Don't worry, I got this one. - No. This is mine. Come on. Darren? What happened? Professor Adams was Purged last night out in the streets like an animal. I am so sorry. So, will there be a class this week? Really, man? Sorry, Darren. Bunch of us are meeting up at the memorial tonight for a candlelight vigil if you'd like to come. We'll be there. Right? Ben, are you all right? Hey. Whatever happened last night, it's okay if you're not ready to talk about it. But when you are, I'll be here. Okay? You don't have to worry about me. I don't think we can save him. We have to try. - Got it. - I'll get a surgeon. No, no, no, there's no time. Hold... hold the clamp. Hey, hey! Wake up, huh? Can you see me? - Shit! - No... hey, no! Clamp it! Hold still! Hey, hey, hey! - Got it. - Hey, who are you? Why did you want me dead? Don't kill me. - Don't kill me. - I'm not trying to kill you. I'm trying to save you! He's barely here. We need some blood. We ran out of type O already. He's not gonna make it. Hey, what's your blood type? Hey... give me the Narcan. What? It's too late. Give me the Narcan now! Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Dr. Moore. Hey! Why did you try to Purge me? Ivory Road. - What? - Ivory Road. Ivory Road. Tommy make it back yet? - Haven't heard from him. - Shit. I had to pay my mother's bills. - It'll come out of my cut. - How's she doing? Same. Doesn't look like much, does it? Not as much as last year or the year before. Why the hell do they have so little cash on hand? I was thinking about that on the walk over. They must be hiding it. How you feeling? She gave me some Codeine for the pain, so... - Shit. - What? Without Tommy's bag, that's 200. Well, that's workable. We'll plan a bigger haul next year. No, Ryan. 200 total. That's everything. We'll be fine. I have a mortgage. Doug has kids. Next year, we buckle down. It's not nothing. We almost died for this money. Trick or treat. No one followed me. What about the eyes in the sky? I crossed three dead zones to get here. That's why I'm late. Jesus. - Hey. - Hey. Can you shut the door, please? So who's Drew Adams? How do you know her? It was a long time ago. It doesn't really matter now. You know I can't have you tag and track someone from your private life. I just saw her on the monitor and I reacted. That's all... just a one-time thing. Then why is she on your personal computer? - Who told you that? - Esme, you are my best tagger. You are critical to how this department functions. You cannot have NFFA property on your laptop. I just need to figure out why she was out on Purge Night. There's something weird about her case. But she's not a case. She's just a woman who got Purged like thousands of others. Did you spot a crime? - No. - So what do you have to go on? I don't know. Feeling? You have to trust me on this one. I'm sorry. Breaking protocol could get us both fired. I'm sure my sister was part of my background check when I got this job, right? She was. After Sofia, Drew Adams was the only person who would even listen to me, so yeah, it is personal. But if you let me dig around and my hunch is wrong, I promise you I'll let it go. Esme, I know how hard it is to watch a loved one get Purged. Believe me. This job takes a toll on you. All we do every single day is look for the worst in people and that can... That can make you jump at shadows, so take some time off, grieve for your friend, then let it go. Okay. Okay. This should help. Fuck the money. I thought they picked you up. Longest walk of my life. How you feeling, Doug? Better that you're here. Who was gonna drink with me? Hey, brother. First round's on me. Bag it, bag it! Let's go! Let's go. New Orleans Police Department! Tommy Ortiz, come out with your hands up! Tommy! Here, take this. They tagged you. - Disappear. - Come on, Ryan... - Go out the back! - And then what? Purge is over. You'd be aiding and abetting. - Hey, I'm not turning you in... - No, this is my fault! I went back for the money. They want me and this money. It's gotta be where it ends. Tommy Ortiz, we know you're in there! That's my song, guys. Tommy. I'm coming out! And I'm unarmed! - Hands up. - I'm unarmed. Hands up. You hereby forfeit your rights as a United States citizen. Anything you say or do by action or inaction will be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney who will be provided for you at our earliest convenience. Do you understand these rights? Do you understand these rights? Shit, shit, shit! It could have been us. It was us. He's family. What's gonna happen to him? They'll hold him over till the next Purge. Then they kill him. Jesus. This'll tide you over. Lay low. I'll be in touch. Ryan. Yeah? Every year, the Purge gets worse... more chaos in the streets, more Jackals, and now Tommy? What are you saying? It's not worth the risk. Give me a moment to figure this out. Do not make a decision until you hear from me. - Okay. - All right. Hey. Oh. I was just taking him to the morgue. Hold for a second. I'll go talk to him. Marcus. Is it true? Yeah. He tried to Purge me last night, and I had to know why. Did he tell you anything? I mean, he... he was just rambling. Lauren, look, you know I would never endanger the life of a patient. I made a call, and he... he was gonna die anyway. I believe you. Go home to Michelle. I will take care of the paperwork. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you all for coming to honor Professor Adams tonight. I know all of us are still reeling from the news. I'm trying to get a clear idea in my head as to how or... why something like this would even happen. Until then, here's what I do know. Drew was a woman who loved fiercely. She loved her family. She was strong. She always took the time to help any stranger. She loved her country, even though she often hated what most of her country was doing, and she was never afraid to tell that to anyone who would ask, either... even if they didn't. You know, I don't know how she died, but I do know one thing for sure. Drew would never stop fighting... Even until the end. _ _ Open up! My God, it's them. Professor Adams, we're coming in. - No, no, no. - The files! This is your last warning! What were you doing? _ Darren. Hey. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Why are you here? I'm just coming to check up on my son after Purge. What's really going on, huh? Listen, somebody tried to Purge me. Son, I need your help. There's our money. Oh, shit. They're swapping trucks. Where is it going? What the? Oh. - Jeez. - I'm so sorry. Uh, we're just doing a first inspection. - Did you wanna look around? - Are you thinking of buying? The owner was just Purged and, uh, we think it's gonna go very fast. It's a historically-protected building. No. Help! Thank God you saved me. I don't know what I would've done if you... Oh, wait. No, please! No! _ Hey, man, come on. You've been in there forever. - My little brother's waiting. - Game over. _ This way, guys. Come on. Follow me. - Daphne, come on! - All right. Tommy's share. I want you to have it. Doug and Sara are okay with this? Wouldn't have it any other way. - How you holding up? - I'm not. Ryan, what the hell happened? There was less money in the vault than we expected. Tommy went back for more. He got tagged on the property when the sirens went off. He was trying to take care of us. You know, a lot of people thought he was a fuck-up, and maybe he was, but he was always trying. Lisa, I am this close to finding out where the banks hide their money, and next Purge... Ryan, you don't have to take care of me. I wanna make sure that you and the little guy are okay. I have some cousins in Arizona who are gonna take us in. I can't bear to stay here, Ryan. Thank you, you know, for this. And thank you for always looking out for him. Oh, God. This is creepy. I mean, the fact that somebody can even do this just shows you how messed up our system is. So how are things going here? You never ask me how school is. Well, I'm asking now. Look, I was working on my thesis, and the professor I was working with was murdered on Purge Night. Are you all right? I mean, were you involved? No, I wasn't there. Son, I'm... I'm sorry. How's Michelle handling all this? Well, she slept with the lights on last night. I don't want to scare her with all this stuff. You know, if I said "Ivory Road," what does that mean to you? It's a website. No, it's not. I checked. Dad, look, it's on the dark web, okay? It's a trading post for all sort of illegal activity. Wait, so how do you know about this? Dad, did this guy say something about Ivory Road? Here, let me see that phone again. It's no use. He wiped it clean. There's no contacts. Nothing in the calendar. The Ivory Road itself isn't necessarily illegal, okay, but it's untraceable, so you can pretty much do anything on it that the NFFA would come down on your head for. - And you use it? - No. But anybody can. Look, all you need is a Tor browser or some other kind of software or... here, like this. Bingo. Look. Have you checked the calculator yet? The calculator? No, why? The icon's different. Look. It's disguised as a calculator. Yeah, it's a hidden app to have direct access, okay? I'm in his Ivory Road account right now. Oh, shit. What? What did you find? Somebody put a bounty on your head. 75 grand to have you killed. But that's impossible. No, that guy never had a grudge against you, okay? He was just trying to get the money, but never got around to collecting it. So is... is the site still active? Yes, and that money's gonna stay in that account until somebody else tries to collect it next year. Whoever's trying to kill you is still out there, Dad. July 5th, 9:03 a.m. I am interviewing test subject 83. How are you sleeping? The same. The same dreams? No. They're different. How are they different? More violent. Do you still think about violence? All I think about is violence. Are you thinking about it now? Yes. Do you still think about violence? All I think about is violence.
