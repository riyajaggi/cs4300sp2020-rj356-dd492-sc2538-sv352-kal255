 Getting you into business with Rex, isn't exactly a favor. There! Right there! Get them! Come on! REX: Split up and find them before they can get to an exit. MIGUEL: The place I told you about, it's this way. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) WOMAN: Yes! Come on. MAN: Yeah, come on! We'll be safe here? Yeah. Trust me. Welcome back. (METAL DETECTOR WHIRRING) MAN: Hey, you better wait in line. We're all trying to get in. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DARK ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) MIGUEL: Just stay close, Penny. Whoa, whoa. Easy there. My name's Pete. Welcome. Penelope, right? Yeah, yeah. MIGUEL: Told you I'd be back. Glad to see you got this guy back here in one piece. MAN: Pete, get over here. - You gotta hear this. - Hold on. (MACHINE GUN FIRING) (DOG BARKING) How close do you think that was? Don't worry. Hey, you're safe. Where you going? JENNA: Bathroom. - Well, should I... - Think I can handle it. - She's on edge. - Yeah, no shit. Jesus, okay. No... (SIGHS) I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to snap. I... (SIGHS) This night has been a long one. Trust me. I know. Like I said, I'm... I'm sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through. - You did what you had to do. - I know. (SIGHS, SNIFFLES) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (WATER RUNNING) Well, tonight's almost over. Gotta be honest. Not feeling great about tomorrow either. I don't even know where to begin. Maybe you start with firing the help. (DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE) I think I'm... I'm gonna head upstairs. Hey, I, uh, was gonna make... I don't know, a sandwich or something for Jen. You want one? Sure. Why not. Cool. Thanks. (SIGHS) (EXHALES) (ELEGANT MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY) (FAINT LAUGHTER) You're gonna be there for me, right? Of course. I can't believe I'm doing this. Listen to your own voice and what's in your heart. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) ALBERT: There she is. How's my angel? You know what that is? I gave that to your mother on our 20th anniversary. Something old. Something borrowed. ALBERT: And something new. ELLIE: Something blue. (SIGHS) Sweetie, what's going on? Maybe this is... this is too fast. Maybe I should wait a few more years. A little cold feet is normal. This is a big day for you. For our whole family. No, no. (STUTTERS) I can't go through with this. Sweetie, you're just overthinking it. No, I'm not overthinking it. I'm not leaving this room. I don't care what they think of me. Honey, your father is right. - You are overthinking it. This... - No, stop. I made my decision. (SIGHS) Fine. (SIGHS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (MOANING SOFTLY) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (SNIFFLES) - (GUNSHOT) - (GASPS) (MUFFLED SCREAM) (SOBS) MAN: He hasn't come in yet! (METAL DETECTOR WHIRRING) I wish you would've told me about Rex, what he does. Yeah? And if I had, would you have gone with him? I guess not. Pete, do you serve food here? Like pancakes? (PETE CHUCKLES) I don't know what your brother promised, but, uh, we don't exactly have a brunch menu. We've got a few snacks in the back. Just stay put. I'll grab us something. So you were a cop before? The Purge put you out of business since there's so little crime? I don't know if that's really how people work. I saw people break the law for all sorts of reasons. Not usually the kind you can save up for one night. But crime is lower, right? That's what they say. Till you've seen it up close. I lost my brother on this night. A random Purger sliced his head clean off. Said he just wanted to watch it roll. That's awful. Miguel and I... We're OMF. When our parents died, they sent us to a counselor. She tried to explain how their sacrifice was going to help more people than it would ever hurt. And we were so little, I don't remember much of it. But I do remember her saying that part. And it made me feel a little better. MAN: Hey, Pete, check this out. Okay. - Excuse me. - Yeah. It must feel nice to believe in something. (RUBBER BAND SNAPS) (KNOCK ON DOOR) - Room service. - (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) A-ha. Wow, that actually smells amazing. Yeah, only took me four tries. (LAUGHS, SNIFFLES) Cheers. Here's to starting over. What do you mean by that? Well, no, I just... I think this night has... taken a toll on all of us. And there was a lot riding on that deal with your dad. And... I don't know. Well, he's gone. But the company's still here, and... I'm his only child, so I guess whatever happens is... up to me. - Lila, we don't need to... - I want to. I want to give you the deal. Look, uh... This really isn't easy. Uh... Part of me feels, like, Jenna and I should never have even started down this road. I mean, we were just trying to be something that we're not. The project isn't just your dream, Rick. It's hers, too. I want to repair something I had a hand in breaking. Please let me do that. That's very generous of you. So... (SNIFFLES, SIGHS) Are we partners? Is it a yes or no? Do you still want the deal? Honestly, Lila, I can't answer that. I need to talk it over with Jenna. Oh, hey. I was, uh... I was just gonna come check on you. I made you a grilled cheese special. Rick, can I have a moment alone with Lila? Rick. Yeah. Yeah, of course. I'll, um... I should probably check on the house again. Hey. Stop, please. What's wrong? I can't live in chaos. I can't do this anymore. We're not doing anything. Why did you offer Rick that deal without me there? Maybe because you knew I wouldn't take it? I wouldn't like it if he did? (SCOFFS) Jen... Listen. You... sparked something in me. You... knocked me off-balance. In a good way. And I was selfish for wanting more. But us, this, whatever thing this is, it can't go on. I'm tired of all the games. But you need someone who can protect you. No. No, I don't. I can protect myself. Did Rick put you up to this? (SCOFFS) He's manipulating you. When are you gonna stop living his life? Is that what you think of me? No, it's just... We can be happy. You know that. You've said that. Oh, I've said a lot of things that, yes, probably made this harder for you. I know. I'm... I was confused. Lila, I want to be clear with you. I know I haven't been in the past. We're done. No. That's bullshit. That's fucking bullshit. I'm sorry. Hey. Do you remember the first time we took you to the stable? - Yeah. - Yeah? You didn't want to get anywhere near those horses. You sat on the ground with your arms crossed. You were like, "No way, Daddy, I'm not going in there." You get that stubbornness from me. (CHUCKLES) I paid that trainer to cancel the rest of her appointments because I was just gonna wait you out for as long as it took. And it took a pretty long time. It must've been five hours before you finally agreed to saddle up. But you know what? I loved it. Still do. And you excelled at it. Joy, true joy, comes from courage. So does greatness. (SIGHS) There are some things that you can only learn through experience. And the strength that you are gonna gain from this today, there is literally nothing that I can say that will make you understand what you're about to feel. I want to be strong. You are. What was it like for you? - Honestly? - Yeah. I was scared as hell. - (CHUCKLES) No. - Of course! I agonized over it for weeks. I mean, what kind of person wouldn't. But, sweetie, that day came. And it was over, just like that. And as soon as I'd done it, truly, I knew it was right. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Coffee, please. Nothing stronger? So what happened? You wandered off the bus and got lost? - No. - You sure? 'Cause we could slip out back and do the deed right now, if you want. Excuse me. I Purged one of you cult kids last year. Didn't put up a fight at all. At least not until the very end. Oh, you're such a badass, what are you doing in here? Get out there, big man. Go out and slaughter some kids. Go! MIGUEL: Hey! Is there a problem? You wanna go? You get one warning. 'Cause I'm in a good mood. Don't bother my friends. Got it. Sorry. That robe is attracting the wrong kind of attention. I got a box full of clothes in the back, if you wanna see if something fits. Sure. Don't start shit in my bar. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Hey. (FAINT CLATTERING) - Rick. - No, hold on. Hold on. (FAINT CLATTERING) Stay... stay here till I get back. Okay? (FAINT CLATTERING) Lila? (FAINTLY) Lila. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Do you want me to take that outside and burn it? You gonna start on me now? Not a fan of your cult. Tavis prefers the term "new religion." (LAUGHS) I'm sure she does. I know you think it's bullshit. But you gotta understand, I was all alone, no place to live, worrying about Miguel halfway around the world. And Tavis was there for me when I needed something to believe in. (SIGHS) Did you meet Tavis in jail? Kantrow rehab. My ex-boyfriend, he, um... I just... I got hooked on some bad stuff. She was your social worker. That's her job. Come in, Penelope. Tavis, uh, chooses her members carefully, from what I gather. They have to be approved. - By who? - The NFFA. That's who's really funding her. That's why she's off-limits tonight. No. No, you've got it all wrong. It's not a political organization. Oh, sure, that's what she says. It's all part of the long con. Think about who she recruits. She trolls jails, hospitals, homeless shelters. To find people who need help, who are looking for a purpose. To find people the NFFA has deemed disposable. Filling up the gas tank on that blue bus is a hell of a lot cheaper than socialized medicine. You're lying. That's not possible. When I was on the force, we had proof: Wire transfers, documents, audition tapes. - What? - They held auditions to find Tavis. She's just playing a part. But I helped her recruit people. You didn't know. Why didn't you say anything? I tried. My partner and I were building a case, but the NFFA has cops in its pockets, too. The bosses squashed the investigation. They destroyed the evidence. Yeah, and now that bus is full of kids just like I was, lost and afraid. I need to find that bus. No, no. Not the bus again. I can't let my friends die for nothing. (GUN COCKING) - Jeez! Oh, my... - Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's just me. It's just me. Why were you banging? It wasn't, I swear. I heard it, too, okay? - (LOUD KNOCKING) - WOMAN: Richard, Jenna! - Are you home? - Shit. Someone's at the door. WOMAN: Are you in there? Oh, fuck! - (BANGING ON DOOR) - (DEVICE BEEPS) - CAROL: Have you seen Ross? - Oh, shit. Richard, please, I can't find Ross. - Please tell me he's in there with you. - Who is that? RICK: Neighbor's wife. Richard, Jenna! Where's Ross? Go home, Carol! What happened in there? Uh, look, we'll talk in the morning, okay? CAROL: No, no! Let me in! Why? So you can finish what Ross started? What? I... Carol, your husband is dead. Lila, shut up. - LILA: What? - What good is telling her that gonna do? - Oh, my God. - Carol, go home, please. God, I told him that you people were dangerous! He attacked us! Open the door! Your husband tried to shoot a pregnant woman. - He got what he deserved. - Carol. - Leave! - Carol! Listen to... Jesus, Carol. Someone's behind you. Carol, listen to me. You have to run now. Oh, fuck, please open the... She's gonna die. - It's her own fault. - Shut up. Carol, listen to me. You need to run, now! LILA: Oh, God. Oh, God. - Oh, sh... - (THWACK) (YELPING) LILA: Oh, my God. - (SQUELCHY THWACK) - (CAROL YELPING) (DEVICE BEEPING) What the hell was that? I told that woman what she deserved to know. Which you didn't have the balls to do. Yeah. And now she's dead. At least she died knowing the truth about her husband. A lot of women never get that chance. Is... Is that supposed to be a dig? Lila... I know you're upset, but Jenna made her decision. Just respect it, okay? My God, you... You're young. You have your whole life ahead of you. (SCOFFS SOFTLY) She talked about leaving you, you know. Did she tell you that? Yeah, of course. She tells me everything. So what'll it take to make you go away? Come on, Ricky. Give me a number. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Wow. You want to buy me. $5 million? $10 million. (LAUGHS) Wow. You're pathetic. But I'm getting closer, aren't I? $20 million. I'm not for sale. I built this life from nothing. I can do it again. (CHUCKLES) That's right. Hardscrabble Rick with his bootstrap stories. But at the end of the day, too chickenshit to pull the trigger. God, you know, the fact that you think that's a weakness speaks volumes. My father always knew you'd never be one of us. He used to joke that you reeked of trash. Poor white trash. Fuck you. (LAUGHS) Aw, I know that look. Same one you gave me on the first night. Now, do you need me to go fuck your wife again for you? - (GRUNTS) - (GASPS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (BREATHING SHAKILY) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Nice to see you. (ELEGANT CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING) ALBERT: Honey. WOMAN: Oh, so beautiful. MAN: Big day, Lila. WOMAN: Good luck. If I could just, for a second, have your attention. Hi! I'd like to thank you all for coming, for celebrating this occasion with us in our home... And with our daughter, our spectacular Lila. Look at you. You're just... (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) You're stunning. Your mother and I have always known that you were destined for magnificence. And we... we truly could not be prouder of you. - Tonight is momentous. - (GUESTS MURMUR IN AGREEMENT) But it's just the first commencement. To a lifetime of glorious participation. WOMAN: Yeah. Cheers. ALL: Cheers. MAN 1: Hear, hear. MAN 2: To Lila. MAN 3: Cheers, Lila. MAN 4: Mmm-hmm. And now, our gift on the eve of your 18th birthday. Gentlemen? (PEOPLE MURMURING) WOMAN 1: Should be fine, right? WOMAN 2: Yeah. (LAUGHS) WOMAN 3: Ah, it's a big decision. WOMAN 4: Choose your path. WOMAN 5: Whenever you're ready, love. (PEOPLE MURMURING) MAN 5: Oh! (EXCLAIMS) WOMAN 6: Oh, great choice. - WOMAN 7: Wonderful. - (LAUGHTER) (SCATTERED APPLAUSE) ALBERT: That's my girl. A toast to my daughter. ALL: Cheers. ALBERT: We're all here to celebrate her and to support her on her journey. To Lila. ALL: To Lila. (GUN COCKING) (GUNSHOT) (MUFFLED, ECHOING) Yes! (APPLAUSE) (MELLOW MUSIC PLAYING) WOMAN: (SINGING) Why you want to waste it? This thing down in your soul. It's taking our places. It's taking our soul. What do you have to show for it? Pete should've kicked that guy out. He seems a little off. Yeah. Maybe he's just having a bad night. (LAUGHS) What about you? Purging? It's a little personal tonight. I'm doing my own thing. Yeah. Had to find someone tonight. That's why I'm out here. Had to bring her somewhere safe. What's next? Next? Yeah, you know, this holiday feels like it lasts a whole lifetime when you're in it, but then the sun comes up. I think, first things first, I'm gonna get breakfast. Ah. (LAUGHS) Yeah, tomorrow can't come fast enough, you know? Huh. First day of the rest of my life. I'm Joe. Miguel. Cheers, Miguel. Cheers. Thank you for your service. (BREATHING HEAVILY) (INDISTINCT CHATTER ECHOING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (LOCK CLICKS) (WATER RUNNING) (VELCRO RIPPING) (FAUCET SQUEAKS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) That bus is full of kids just like me, lost and so sure they're doing the right thing. They deserve to know the truth about Tavis. Would they even believe you? I mean, they know me. Maybe they'd believe me. Pen, even if you could convince any of them, any of them, we almost died getting back here. More than once. PENELOPE: I know that, but they're all gonna die, and it's my fault they're out there. MIGUEL: They're not our problem. Albert Stanton is dead. MIGUEL: It's not your fault. (WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY) - Pete, gun! - Miguel! (PEOPLE CLAMORING) Rocco, move your ass! (BOTH GRUNTING) (KEYPADS BEEPING) (GRUNTING) You motherfucker, Pete! My brother's rotting in prison 'cause of you! Who the hell is this guy? Hey, Samuel, it's Penelope. I need to talk to Tavis. (GRUNTING) MAN: Rossito. Zeke Rossito. What? Brian's brother? That sick bastard deserves to be behind bars for life. Get him out of here! Come on, you shit bag. Get him up, Rocco. Get him. Get him. MAN: Take him outside! (GRUNTS) Move, move, move! Anybody else want to ruin a good thing tonight? (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) Good luck out there. (DISTANT EXPLOSION) (BREATHING HEAVILY) Pete. Hey, listen, Penelope told me something about... Where's Penelope? Shit. Probably shouldn't have told her about Tavis. Wait, you don't think she really... Check the bathrooms. I got the office. (SIGHS) (SIGHS) - (YELLS) - Oh! - (YELLING) - (RICK GROANING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) You did this. - You chose this. - Lila, stop! Jenna, Jenna, Jenna, go back upstairs. It's okay. I'm protecting us. He grabbed me. He tried to kill me. No, I don't want any more violence tonight. He's a violent man! What if he hurts you or the... or the baby? Would you risk that? Would you raise our child with this monster? She's not your child. Rick, no! No. I was there when it happened. You needed me to make her happen. But now you want to cut me out of your life? He's making you do this. I know he is. He hates what we have. Put the gun down. Put it down. You love me, right? Tell me I'm not crazy. Because I don't know what's real anymore. Yes. It was real. It was real when I said those things. I meant them when I said them. I'm so sorry I hurt you. Okay? Please, I'm sorry. Please. I know you love me. You'll understand one day, I did this for us. - No, no, no! - (KNIFE SLASHES) (GUNSHOT) (BREATHES SHAKILY) (DISTANT GUNSHOTS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (FAINT GUNSHOTS) (DOG BARKING) (GLASS SHATTERS) (DOG BARKING) (FAINT GUNSHOTS) - MAN 1: Get back here, you traitor! - (MAN 2 GRUNTING) MAN 3: Come here, you bitch! (ENGINE RUMBLING) (BRAKES SQUEALING) (BUS HISSES) Tavis. I need to talk to you. Sister Penny, you're alive. We came as fast as we could. Come. Don't listen to anything Tavis says. She's a liar who wants us to die. She gets paid for it. - Sister Penelope, please. - Stay away from me! Listen, get off the bus now and come inside, please. We'll be safe. You've gotten lost on your way to the Invisible. You're not the first. I saw the night for what it really is. A chance for us to heal those who are suffering and... No, your chance to line your pockets. You never told us that you were funded by the New Founding Fathers. The people I care for have no means. All of the money is used to support the mission, to support people like you, like all of you. Look, don't let her twist this. She picked us because the NFFA told her we were disposable. I didn't choose you. You chose me. I am trying to make the world a better place - by any means necessary. - Bullshit. You understood that once. Were you not happy under my care? I was, but it was based... You were. (SHUSHING) You were happy. And now, self-interest has clouded your judgment and made you weak. I should've known that you weren't ready. Not yet. Not this year. Not ever. - (GRUNTS) - (GIRLS SCREAMING) What the hell do you think you're doing? Come here! (SCREAMS) Let go of me! (GUN COCKING) JOE: Let her go. Hey, man, I just drive the bus. (GUNSHOTS) (PEOPLE SCREAMING) I don't want to die. How about I take you somewhere safe? The Cantina. It's safe. - No. - (WHIMPERING) Miguel! Pen! (PEOPLE WHIMPERING) Pen! Penelope! - (ENGINE STARTS) - Pen! Pen! I did this. You saved my life. Hey. (GRUNTS) Hey. We're gonna be okay. - I promise. - (ALARM CHIRPS) AUTOMATED VOICE: System disarmed. (GARAGE DOOR RUMBLING) What's going on? I have no idea. (MUFFLED WHIMPERING) (MUFFLED GRUNTING) (MUFFLED GRUNTING) (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (MUFFLED SCREAMING) (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (JENNA CRYING)
