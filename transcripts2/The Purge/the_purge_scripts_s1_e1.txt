 My Darlings. It's almost your commencement. You all look so beautiful, my angels. Miguel, I don't know if you will ever get this letter. I hope you know that I am okay and that I am loved, and that I am ready. Please don't worry. Don't be sad. I'm joining Mom and Dad on the anniversary of their Giving. I am stepping into the Invisible, where they are waiting for me. They miss me, and they love me, and I miss them so much.

 I'm sure you do too. I think about them every day. I love you, Miguel. I always will. Love, Penelope. - Mom, please! - Enough. I'm not gonna say it again. Excuse me. Sorry, very busy. Commencement is close. You guys don't count as a hospital, huh? The NFFA doesn't care about protecting drug addicts and alcoholics. We have to lock down like everyone else. What do you need? My name's Miguel. I called a few times this morning.

 I'm here to see my sister. No visitors are allowed today. Look, I've been away a while, and I... I need to know. Sorry, I can't help you. Look, can you just please promise me that you have a safe place for her tonight? Mom, I really want one. I'm not gonna say it again. Stop asking. He wants a gun. He's finally old enough to understand what this holiday is all about. He's terrified. I'm not scared! Hey, you wanna know something? I'm scared, too. I'm scared every Purge. But I learned a trick when I joined the Marines. One day, the bad guys had us surrounded. And our Sergeant, he noticed that we were all scared. And you know what he had us do? Hold hands. - What? - Yeah. He said that it was scientifically proven that if you hold hands with someone, - it lessens your fear. - Really? Yeah. Can you imagine how we looked? A bunch of tough Marines all holding hands together? Yeah, we felt silly. But then it worked. The fear went away. - Thank you. - Yeah. What's your sister's name? Penelope Guerro. Oh. I'm sorry. She checked out a few months ago. Checked out? Where did she go? I'm not permitted to give away patient information. - Ma'am, please, it's... - Federal law. It's the Purge. Just, please. But that doesn't mean I can stop you from finding what you need when I walk away. I hope you find her. Penelope's a really sweet person. Henry. Goddamn it. Okay. - My baby. Hi. - Hey. I brought your favorite flowers. Ugh. Good. It'll cover up the awful smell of this damn hospital food. Well, Rose says that you'll be home in a few days, that you're doing great, better than expected. - You going to or coming from work? - Going to. On Purge Night? You need to be staying here with me. This is the safest place in the city. The office is safe, Mom. I wouldn't be going if it wasn't. I'll be fine. They take care of us there. They do. You know, I thought by now you'd be in a position where you wouldn't have to work on a night like this. You and me both. If you'd had just played the game a little... Oh, Mom, don't start. Don't do that. I have to go, Mom. It's getting close to commencement. Take all of your meds and don't give everyone a hard time. I wouldn't be Lorraine Barbour if I didn't give everybody a hard time. - Be safe, okay? - Mmm-hmm. - Call me. - Love you. - Call me. - Love you. You okay, babe? What's on your mind? Oh, I was just wondering what it's gonna be like over there. I mean we really have no idea how these people celebrate the Purge. Oh, don't think about it. Find a corner, hide, and wait to be summoned. Jenna, does it look like a rental? No way. You look amazing. - Me? - Beautiful. As always. I can't lie. I am nervous as shit. Don't be. It'll be safer than any other place in the country over there. Not that. I just, I want it all to go well. You know, an opportunity like this comes around once in 12 lifetimes. It's gonna go great. This is just a formality. Only reason we're being invited is because he wants to do this with us. We're making a deal with the devil, babe. We're taking the devil's money, and we're gonna do great things with it. I hope there are no surprises tonight. She won't be there. No worries. Tonight's our night. This is a game changer. This is everything we ever wanted. For us. For our family. Only 84 minutes to go before the Purge sirens start blaring. If Box Store sales are any indication, this year may be bigger than ever, as guns, ammunition, and survival goods are flying off the shelves. It's an arms race in many neighborhoods as locals struggle to find better weaponry than their neighbors, and semi-automatic rifles are all but scarce at most outlets. 911 calls are spiking in record numbers as nervous citizens make last minute calls while police and fire prepare to go off duty. If you don't have a high-tech security system, do what you can before it's too late. Security experts warn that Purgers have grown increasingly bold, specifically targeting homes that have been secured with nothing more than plywood and nails. Purge mask? Need a Purge mask, sir? God! Are you nuts? I don't know where Henry is. I know you know where he is. Why you breaking my balls like this, man? I don't know where the fuck he is. It ain't the Purge yet, fella. Can't you wait another hour? Ah! Stay down. What did I do to deserve this? Aren't you supposed to be gone somewhere fighting some stupid war? Lucky for you, I just got back. Now, tell me where Henry is. No more bullshit, asshole. Please, please, please, I don't know. - Where? - I don't know. Maybe he's at the Row. Well, then, let's go visit the Row. Let me out of here! Hey! You're not working tonight, are you, Jane? Oh. Overseas markets don't care about the Purge. Ugh. Girl, good luck. Thanks. - Hey, Boss. - Hey, Employee. Chiho's landed in Tokyo. Should be at the office before we dive in. - Everything okay? - Fine, fine. Oh, how's your Mom? Doing well. Thanks for asking, Mark. Good, good. Oh. First time I've ever worked on Purge night. It's, uh... It's weird. There's no better place to be than here. It's 5:51 p.m., just 69 minutes until the Purge begins. If you're not locked down, you're almost out of time. Names? Mark Cantoff. Jane Barbour. You're good. Great. Now let me take you through the rules. Once the Purge begins, this 38th floor will be locked down as a safe zone. Security and all workers, including the both of you, have signed waivers, giving up their rights to Purge on this floor for the entire evening. Everyone on 38 except security will be unarmed. We can only guarantee your safety on this floor. Do you understand these rules? Thank you for your cooperation. Enjoy the evening. Hello, everyone. - Hi, Jane. - Hi. - Hello. Hello. - Hi, Jane. - Hi. - Hi. Jane. I spoke with Chiho. And she is... She's on the ground already. I heard. Did you guys come here together, or... Of course. Mark spent the afternoon with me reviewing everything for tonight. Relax, Alison. I'm joking. The two of you need to put aside your nonsense, and play nice tonight. There's lot to do. Now, get Chiho on the phone while I settle. Afterwards, I'll prep the troops on what we should expect, okay? Okay? We are the scarred, the beaten, the souls irreparably damaged. And it is that shared pain that allows us to understand each other so deeply. Tonight, that suffering ends, my darlings. I will be your guide into the Invisible, where there is no pain, only love. - Yes. - Yes. Come. The Giving Time is near. Let us ready. Hmm. Sit. Sit. Good girl. Hey, guys! - Going out tonight? - Oh, god. Yup. Stay safe, Ross. Oh, yeah. You too. Come on, come on. Stay. Sometimes I wish we purged, babe. Ross and his mutt would be gone for good, and we wouldn't have to navigate huge piles of dog shit on our lawn anymore. This could be a grand night. Well, we are going out during Purge for the first time ever. You're saying we should take advantage? Uh-huh. Okay. Sorry for making you work so close to Purge. Yeah, you're not... You're not working all night, are you? Ah, some guys do. Driving around crazies for that Purge surge money. Not me, though. You guys are my last trip. I go home and lock in. I know this place. It's the Stanton residence. What is it, some kind of fancy NFFA Purge party? We don't know. It's, uh, our first time being invited. Um... Purging's not our thing. Why the hell you going then? Uh, it's a kind of business deal. That's some New Founding Fathers shit, huh? No, it's not. It's nothing like that. We're trying to get an investment that will help us build housing for the poor, the less fortunate. I always wondered something about these big parties. How can you trust anyone? We had to sign a release that guarantees we can't Purge or be Purged. - Yeah, they even made us do background checks. - I get it. Rich people don't kill each other on Purge night. We're not rich. Far from it. Tonight, you are. First things first, team. Ryker Moore Equity is safer than our homes tonight. So let's put the Purge out of our minds so we can all focus on work. Nothing else. Now, I want to stress the following. Each of you brings something to this deal that is integral to its closure. Closure that must happen before our markets open in the morning. It's a lot of detailed work. Let's do it together, and we can all be rewarded. And if we close this deal early, which is possible if the Japanese markets turn in our favor, we can do some celebrating. I brought a case of Don Julio 1942 that we can all share. Okay? All right. So let's get to it... Sorry to interrupt. Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt. Good evening, everyone. - Good evening. - Evening, Jane. I just wanted to thank everyone. An all-nighter is one thing, but an all-nighter on Purge Night is another whole level of commitment, and I can't thank you enough for doing this. It's unfortunate, but we had no choice. Talk about bad timing. - No, David, please. - It's totally fine. As you all know, Jane is much smarter than me. That's why I hired her. She makes me look good. But sometimes, a little dumbing down can't hurt to clarify things, and I'm good at dumbing, so here goes. You'll all get larger bonuses if you close the Chiho deal tonight. All of you. We do what we do for money, and you'll make much more if you deliver. Great. I love it. Let's get to work. I'll touch base later. Jane. The room is yours. I'll get out of your way now. I forgot that you were the eavesdropping type, David. You know I'm always watching and listening, Jane. Talk later. Keep me posted. Okay, let's get to it. Come on. Where are you? I told you. She's not home, babe. She's still away in Africa. Just relax and focus on why we came here, okay? Yeah. - You're clear. - Thank you. Ma'am? Hands up. Turn around, ma'am? Thank you. You're clear. Sir. Hands up. Hey. It's our time, sweetie, our time to escape all the pain, to escape your father, that monster, forever. Remember Good Leader's words. They'll guide you into the Invisible. I don't see the Stantons anywhere. You think they'd be greeting all their guests. Why don't you go look for Mister Stanton, babe? The quicker you start the conversation, the sooner we can find a room and avoid any Purging that's gonna happen. The sooner I start the conversation? What about you? This is our company. Fifty-fifty. Oh, no, no, no. I'm creative. You're business. You would never mess with my designs. I don't mess with your negotiating. This is you, partner. Hey. I love you. Now go make that son of a bitch pay for making us come here, to the belly of the beast, on Purge night. - Hmm. - Oh, and don't forget, after you close the deal, he's probably gonna make a pitch for us to become NFFA party members. Oh, I know. I'm ready for it. I'll deflect my way out of it. Now, remember, Billy Sabian closed a huge deal for his startup here last year, and he didn't join, all right? So the deal's not predicated upon it. Cold hard money drives Stanton way more than politics. You wear that rented tux very well, Mr. Betancourt. That is a confidence builder, Mrs. Betancourt. Now go make our dreams come true. Yes, ma'am. Hi, seltzer with lime, please. Yeah. Ma'am? Hors d'oeuvres, ma'am? What? No! Come back here. Do you know what you did? Look at me when I talk to you. Look at me! Do you know how long it takes? What... Please go. What... Is Henry here? Speak. I feel like no matter what I say, you're gonna beat my ass. He's in there! Are you sure? Sometimes, he's there. Sometimes, he's not. - I don't know. Maybe? - All right. You're my escort. You hear me? - Whoa, whoa. - You're gonna get me inside. What? No, no, no. I don't think... That is not a good idea! No, this is... This is not a good idea. Who is it? Hey, hey, hey, T. It's me. Asshole. It's all good. I got a... I got a buddy. Who the hell is this? Uh, he's cool, Lenz. He's just a buddy. What's with Kaylee? Why is she cuffed? She been dipping into your stash? No, man. That's for her own good. We're having a little holiday soiree later, and sweet Kaylee's gonna be our Purge dessert. You boys should come too. It's Purge Night. Anything goes! I'll pass. I'm looking for Henry. I'm an old friend. I know all of Henry's friends, but I don't know your ass. My ass has been away awhile. Where's your ass been? My ass's been in the Marines. Hot shit. Yeah. Soldier Boy. G.I. Joe. So, Rambo, what you want with Henry? You know, I'd like to reconnect. - You know, it's been awhile. - Look out! Help. Please. These bastards are not your friends. Never come back here. I will check and make sure that you don't. You understand? Look at me. Look at me. It's almost commencement. Do you have a safe place to go tonight? My parents don't live far away, but they're pretty pissed off at me. But they'll let me in. Okay. The city's about to turn into Hell. You need to go there. Now. Thank you so much. Go with your family, Kaylee. Quick. There's an eerie and unsettling scene in this neighborhood. The streets are nearly empty as Purge commencement is now only 35 minutes away. In the last few minutes, we have seen a few vehicles crossing behind us, and some stragglers, now at this point, jogging or even running to get to what we assume is some sort of safe haven. Others have looked out from behind mostly closed curtains, but for the most part, this area is a ghost town. - Hey. - Oh, hey. Sorry. I just want everything to go smoothly with this deal. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So Mark and I were wondering if... About who's getting the VP position? This is not the time or the place to speak about it. That's actually not what I was going to talk about, Jane. One of the interns brought pastry. We were wondering if you wanted any. Alison, look... Where are you, Penelope? Hey. What are you still doing here? I didn't say it in there because I didn't want them to hear. What? Say what? I know who you're looking for. Your sister. And I know where you need to go, but you ain't gonna like it. Miss Barbour. It's minutes away from commencement. This is the only secure floor in the building. I'll be fine. Back in a few minutes. We can't guarantee your safety. Don't worry. Not for you. Oh, shit. Wait. I told you, no transactions until the Purge begins. Sorry. Oh! So sorry, Miss. Are you okay? Please, don't... Don't apologize. I wasn't looking where I was going. I don't want to bother you, but maybe you could help me? Do you have Tylenol? I'm not feeling too well. Yes, of course. Please, follow me. It's none of my business, but I saw what happened with Mrs. Stanton earlier. Is your wrist okay? I'm fine. Thanks for asking. She's probably just tense and uptight and wants everything to be perfect for this stupid Purge Party. That's not an excuse, but it's something. You don't like this night? No, I don't at all. I'm not even NFFA. May I ask, why are you here then? A business opportunity. Ah. Right. Mister Stanton likes doing business on Purge Night. I overhear a lot. Is there anything else you need, Miss, uh... Jenna. Call me Jenna. No, I don't... I don't need anything else. And your name is? - Catalina. - Catalina. It's nice to meet you. You too, Miss... - Sorry. Jenna. - That's okay. Thank you, you are a lifesaver. Lila. Prognosticators are predicting a record turnout tonight, so unless you want to release the beast, get home ASAP, as we are minutes away from the annual blood holiday. Purge Night, baby! Purge Night! Purify my flesh. Grief at my soul. The Giving is near. The Invisible awaits. Is anyone here? Is anyone here, goddammit? Are you here to join us? Become our brother? To serve her? The Good Leader accepts one, accepts all. What? What the hell? Please join us. We always have room for more. We were just about to lock-down for the night. Good Leader will be back... - Shut the hell up! - We didn't mean to agitate you. Agitation is never our intent. How can we help you? I'm looking for someone. Someone who might be here. My sister. Of course. Goddess Penny. Sister Penny. We know what happened to you and your sister on the very first Purge. - You're both so special. - Enough! Look, she wrote me this letter. "I'm joining them" "on their anniversary." "Stepping out of my flesh and into the Giving," "into the Invisible." She's talking about our parents that were killed on Purge Night years ago. So I know she's in deep shit tonight. What is "the Giving"? What is "the Invisible"? She's Giving. It's her time. We're not ready yet. None of us. We're just too young now. - What does it mean to "Give"? - To help them. Those in need, those who have anger and hatred in their flesh, those who must release it. - I don't understand. Is she Purging? - No. Never. She's being Purged upon. What? What is the goddamn "Invisible"? It's what you call Heaven, but it's different. It's where lucky OMF Goddess Penny is going tonight, where she will rejoin your parents. Where's my sister right now? - Come on, big boy. - Hey. Oh, god, I was just looking for you. You okay? You look pale. I'm fine. Just my stomach's upset. - Did you find him? - No, I saw him, but he was busy talking to someone else. I didn't want to interrupt. Everyone. Everyone. Can I have your attention? We are just minutes away from the start of this glorious holiday. But first, I wanted to thank all of you for coming. I am so proud to be, not only the host of our annual Party, but to be, along with my husband, co-chairs of the state's New Founding Fathers benefactor committee. - Hear, hear! - Hear, hear! Most of you are major donors to the NFFA, and those who are not will be convinced to open their wallets later tonight. We should all feel proud of what we've accomplished over these last few years. It's our private money, our generous donations to the New Founding Fathers, that have not only put them in the White House, but is what keeps them there. - Yes. - Yes. I like to call our donations "long-term ideological investments." Our support of the NFFA helps them implement policies and programs that we believe in, including the Purge. The great liquidator of our time. Liquidator? Tonight, on our holiday, we celebrate our accomplishments. We pat ourselves on the back because we made this country great. So thank you, and I hope this party's as good as last year's. Okay, okay. Enough political talk. Let's begin! Oh, wait. Uh, in case anyone forgot, once we lock down, we won't be opening the barricades until the Purge is over, for obvious safety reasons. So, uh, this is your last chance, folks. Anyone want out? You sure you want to do this? Well... Yeah. Lock down complete. Ladies, bring out the gifts. Everyone please take one. We have a Purge theme tonight. You'll understand when you see it. Don't be afraid. Go ahead. Take one. And our maids will tell you about the person who you'll be wearing tonight. David Berkowitz? Son of Sam? Are you kidding me? This is insane. Who the hell is this? Susan Denise Atkins was a member of the Charles Manson family, who committed nine murders in the summer of 1969. - Okay, let's just put them on. So we don't stick out. - Mmm-hmm. We wear these masks to commemorate those who paved the way and Purged before it was legal. They risked their freedom because they knew the incredible, life changing, healing power of violence, of killing. Okay... Wow. I think all of you have your masks on now. Great. We are just seconds away now, so if you'd please direct your attention toward these screens. This is not a test. This is your emergency broadcast system announcing the commencement of the Annual Purge sanctioned by the US Government. Weapons of Class Four and lower have been authorized for use during the Purge. All other weapons are restricted. Government officials of ranking 10 have been granted immunity from the Purge and shall not be harmed. Commencing at the siren, any and all crime, including murder, will be legal for 12 continuous hours. Police, fire, and emergency medical services will be unavailable until tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m. when the Purge concludes. Blessed be our New Founding Fathers and America, a nation reborn. May God be with you all. Okay. Let the fun begin! My god. Maybe we should've gotten the hell out of here. Let's Purge! Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Whoo! Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul. The Giving is near. The Invisible awaits. Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul. The Giving is near. The Invisible awaits. Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul. The Giving is near. The Invisible awaits. Purify my flesh. Prepare my soul. The Giving is near. The Invisible awaits. You need to go find Albert. Close that goddamn deal so we can... Lila, good to see you. How wonderful to see you! There's no turning back. You can follow my progress live on the app you downloaded. - Great. - You're third tonight. Depending on what I run into, it may not get filled for several hours. - Okay. - You got it? I got it. Whoo! Look at those crazy bastards. Don't worry. I know you will. Toward the lot. The Giving is here. Now... Now we must do our duty. We help the sinners release their hatred. We step out of our flesh and become vessels by which to carry their sins. The Earth's Children will reap the rewards of our selflessness, and we will exit righteously, escaping the darkness of our life and reaping the rewards of the Invisible, my children. This one last moment of suffering will lead to eternal love. Arthur, it is your time to Give. I've loved myself too much. And I have loved you all too little. Goodbye, Arthur. We love you, Arthur. Enter into peace. Purify his Flesh. Cleanse his soul. The Giving is here. The Invisible awaits. Purify his flesh. Cleanse his soul. The Giving is here. The Invisible awaits. Step into the Invisible. Step into the Invisible. Step into the Invisible. Take me into the Invisible. Take me into the invisible. Take me. It's my time to give. It's my time to give. It's my time to give.
