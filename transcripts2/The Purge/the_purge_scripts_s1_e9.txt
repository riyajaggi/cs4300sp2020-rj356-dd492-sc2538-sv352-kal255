You will consider the evidence I present. There will be... perhaps a dialogue. And then you'll confess. And if your confession is compelling, I will exercise mercy. But, if you decline to confess or your confession is insufficient, I will Purge. And I will be reborn. God bless America. - Joe! I understand that you're still angry, but I was just a messenger that day. There was nothing I could've done to help keep Saticoy afloat.

It's all right. - Next, let's talk about exam week. Winter, my sophomore year, the day it snowed.

Open up! - Are you serious? - Rachel, chill, he's all right. - Open it up. ♪ [engine turns over] - Stay safe. - Now, your confession. [camera beeps] Look in the camera. This way, I will be able to revisit this moment, anytime I choose. - I told you I don't know you. I-- - Charlie. I explained this. If you refuse, I'll assume your guilt. You'll be Purged. - [sighs] - Don't you wanna offer your side of all this? Hey, hey. - [gasps] - Come on, let me hear what you have to say. [taps] - [exhales] I remember you, okay? [soft music] ♪ You were Joey. The smart kid. Always did your homework. You were proud of it. Like, proud that being smart was easy. It wasn't like that for me, man. In my house, nothing was easy. ♪ I wish I hadn't treated you so bad. It wasn't right. But look at me. I've been on the street, like, ten years. Maybe I got what I deserved. ♪ I didn't think-- I didn't know that you were still hurting. But I know now. So... maybe you'll let me go? It's a miracle I've survived this long with The Purge. Maybe that's my punishment, being this. [soft sobbing] ♪ [beeps] ♪ - See? Don't you feel better? I do. Come on. Thank you. Thank you. - [sobbing] [blade stabs] [grunts] [groaning] [gasping] [wheezing] [dark music] ♪ - [screams] - [gasps] ♪ - It's okay. [blade whips] - [soft crying] - Oh, my God... - Hm. Like I said... mercy. - This is a goddamn nightmare. We know that man, right? I remember his face. He's one of our subs. - Yeah. He installed the security system on the Smith Street complex last year. - Does he have a reason for wanting to kill us? - No. - [soft crying] - His confession meant nothing. He won't listen to reason. Jane, what are we going to do? [rattling] [suspenseful music] ♪ - Listen up. We outnumber him. If we work together, we can take him. Rick and I will rush him. - He's got a taser and a gun. If we--if we can get it away from him-- - Good idea, good idea. When we tackle him, you take his weapon. - Okay. - We all need each other to survive. That's our mission, understand? [door opens] Oh, shit, Joe. [door shuts] - Eileen. Now it's your turn. [brooding music] Come on. - Eileen, wait! - Eileen! - [grunts] [panting] ♪ - [yelps] - Oh, my God! No... - [weeping] - What a waste. She denied herself a fair trial. - Oh, my God. - Do not mistake me for some animal, killing strangers in the street. I know what this night is really for. I am well-prepared. Charlie should not have lied to me, and Eileen should not have fled. I worked veryhard to get you all here in one piece, healthy, ready to stand trial. The building is rigged to keep others out and to keep all of you in. You cannot run from my justice! [dark music] ♪ - We can still fight our way out. Together. It's the only way. - I will lay her to rest with Charlie. Jane Barbour will be next. ♪ - So do you wanna explain why some ex-cop is more popular than The Pope in this town? What was she talking about back there--Blue Friday? Back when The Purge was new, a lot of guys with badges thought it was a quicker route to justice than the courtroom. And I didn't agree with that. - So you stopped a bunch of dirty cops from Purging. - Something like that. The department didn't appreciate it, but a lot of other people did. - Yeah, I bet. - Nowadays, it's, like, carving jack-o'-lanterns on Halloween. - What do you mean? - People like to make rules on this night. Traditions, routines. - Oh, so you're one of their traditions. - Don't mess with Pete the Cop. [lowers voice] He's off limits. Of course, not everybody agrees with that. - Yeah, like that asshole with the 3D printed gun, huh? - Mm-hmm. My special privileges in this town have an expiration date. Your generation-- you're too young to remember. But, until then... well, it's nice bar, right? - [whispering] Is he gonna listen to reason when we're up there? - He has to. - Whatever you're holding back, Rick, just tell me. - Jane, sit down. - He thinks we owe him money. But he's wrong. I paid him. - You remember me? - Oh, I remember you, Joe. - You like this place? - I do. It's... It's more relaxed than I was expecting but, yeah. - It's not, like, you dressed for a fancy place anyway. [chuckles] - I wasn't-- So... tell me about what you do. - I, uh, I specialize in Purge security systems. It's my second career. I was a foreman at Saticoy before. - You were there when they-- - They sent all our jobs [with an accent] to Mexico. Yeah, but, you know, I tried to make it work. I was good at math in school so I-- I retrained. - That's great. Good for you. - Uh, my, uh, dad isn't so impressed. He likes a job where you have to use your hands more than your head. - [laughing] Parents can be hard to impress. [lounge music playing] So how long have you been on the dating app? To be honest, I... I really-- I didn't know what to expect. - [chuckling] Yeah. I had my reservations too. - Mm-hmm. - But, it's how people meet each other now. [stammering] It always feels so tricky, you know. There's only so much you can tell from a profile and a picture. - Mm. - Like, with you, I was worried that you were gonna be, like, loud and sassy and-- You are very laid-back, which is great. - I was surprised, too, because you looked so much younger in your photo. [both chuckle] - It's the best photo of me. A guy has to use a good pic, otherwise a girl will swipe left. I-I'm not being dishonest. Did you go to college? - First one in my family. I got a scholarship to Wharton. - That is a good school. - [chuckles] I loved it. I mean, it really set my path. I work in finance. - You're very lucky... to be able to take advantage. - Advantage of what? - Well, you know, they need to have, uh, certain number of-- They need to make it easier for some people to get in. Right? - I worked very hard for my opportunities, Joe, so... what makes you assume otherwise? - Oh, whoa, hey, whoa. [nervous chuckle] I'm sorry you got offended. It wasn't a racial thing. - Okay, sure. - I mean, come on, I get nervous when I get pulled over by a cop, too, you know. [stammering] It's a universal thing. - I have to go to the ladies' room. Would you excuse me? - Sure. - Mm. - Uh, when you come back, I wanna hear about Wharton. [tense music] I'll see you in a minute. [clears throat] ♪ [chuckles] ♪ [indistinct chatter] - Can I get you something else? - Mm... Oh, you know what? when the time comes... make sure you put the whole tab on this. I don't want her to insist on splitting. I'm trying to treat this lady right. - Oh... sir, the woman you were with paid already... for both of you. She left. - Oh. - Uh, I-I'm happy to get you anything else you might need. ♪ - Are you for real with this shit? [gavel thuds] - I will finish my testimony, and then you will speak-- - No, you are finished. You tracked me down tonight over a date. Am I getting this correct? - It wasn't just that. You were judging me the whole time. Showing off. Paying the check. You didn't even give me a cha-- - Look me in the eye and tell me that it's worth ending my life over a bad date, and while we're at it, let's-- - I wasn't-- - Talk about how you treated me on that date. The things you said. I can't believe after what I've been through tonight... - You didn't give me a chance-- - I'm sitting here listening - You just made a bunch of... - To a man call me... - Classist assumptions... - That I didn't laugh hard enough at his racist jokes. [Taser clicking] [engine revving] [tire screech] [suspenseful music] ♪ [distant gunshots] - No truck. It's a dead end. - It's our best lead. I say we sweep it, fast. Go, brother. ♪ - Shit. It's rigged. - Let's try the side. ♪ - C4. I've seen stuff like this overseas. I'm not a bomb tech... but I think I can disable it. - Yeah? You sure? - Maybe step back. - [murmurs] Jesus. [tense music] ♪ - Joe? [coughing] [coughing] [coughing] What? [groans weakly] - Where's Joe? - [panting] - Tell us where he is, now. - [chuckles, coughing] You gonna-- you gonna interrogate me? [laughs] - I'm gonna keep looking around. Keep your cool. - All right, be careful. This place is-- - Rigged! Eyes peeled. - Time for you to confess. - I have nothing to confess. - Of course you do. [snickering] Look at you. How you use your advantage living a comfortable life at the expense of hard-working men like me. - Youhave no idea what I went through to get this life. What I'm stillgoing through. - Uh, you had a chance to tell me about it. - Joe, I've been on that date a thousand times before you, and it never ends well for me. Those not-so-subtle comments-- - This again. You know, you are so goddamn busy being victim, you can't see the harm your actions caused me. - Caused you? - Have you heard of Bobby Sheridan? - [whispers] Oh, my God. - The way he explains it, it's perfect. Ambition functions like a sail, carrying you through life-- - I can't believe this is happening. - You meet people who try to tear at your sail, like you. Like all of you. You tried to sink me! But tonight, I will patch each of those tears, carefully, thoroughly. The strong fix themselves... with action! - I really hurt your feelings, didn't I? - [sighs] - I get it. But, Joe... when that happens, you move on. You grow up, little boy. You swipe right for someone new. You don't go kill people. It's called being an adult. - Hmm. But... if it's so wrong... [soft suspenseful music] Why did you Purge your boss, David Ryker, just two hours ago? Was that your idea of moving on? Hmm? Being an adult? ♪ - Miguel! Get up here! Check this shit out. - Jesus. - He's been planning this for months. - This stuff. Military tech. Puts off a chemical signature you can track for miles. Lasts about three weeks. - That's how he tracked all these people. Sprayed them with that shit before Purge Night. ♪ - You see Penelope? - Shit. This is why that asshole took Penelope? I'm done with the games. Tell us where your crazy son is. - He's not crazy. - You seen his room lately? - Oh, you mean-- you mean his project? Yeah, impressive shit, right? - It's not the word I'd use. - Yeah, well, I'm impressed. It's about time he grabbed life by the balls. [groaning] Thank God for The Purge, giving him purpose. - What's any of this got to do with my sister? - Ohh. She's on his list. [grunts] She's done for. My Joey. [laughing] He thought of everything. You'll never get inside that school. - What school? - You talking about Thomas Paine, the high school that closed down? It's up on his wall. - [breathing weakly] - What do we about him? - Look around. This dude's on borrowed time. Let the old bastard rot. - [shouts] Fuck you! - When I'd found Jane, she was being subjected to terrible mistreatment at the hands of her boss. I intervened because Purging Jane, Purging any of you is my right. She wouldn't leave without punishing her tormentor... which is her right. I watched her execute an unarmed man. How can I be denied the same privilege, Jane? - You want me to confess? I confess I hate this night. It doesn't heal or fix anything. It just makes the worst of us worse and the best of us just a little less than. - You're wrong. The old Jane was not this feisty. She's feeling the power of The Purge tonight. - No, no. No, Joe, it was something else. I've tried to live my life with integrity and respect for myself, for others, for the rules. I earned my opportunities. Even when some people said that I should use other... attributes to sweeten the deal, I said no. Then I got into the real world and I found out that being a professional woman, the real job is to be a good sport, to work twice as hard for half the opportunity, letting men like you dangle advancement and promise me that the cost of success is enduring a few more harmless jokes about my nice ass. But The Purge is the equalizer, right? My chance to take the brass ring at gunpoint. It can't be immoral... if it's legal, right? [tense music] I'll give you a confession. I Purged. - [soft chuckle] - Killed a repugnant pig. Do you know what it made me feel? Nothing but shame. I compromised who I am and what I've worked a lifetime to be for a sexual predator. What a thing to live with. - You're not gonna have to live with it for very much longer. - You're so proud of all this? - Mm-hmm. - Digging up old bullies and tracking down bad dates, blaming us for all your problems? How much time and energy did you spend? You think you're on the path to freedom? You don't see how small this makes you? Purging fixes nothing. It fixes nothing, Joe. It just gives us people like you and now, people like me, and that's it. That's it! - You okay, brother? Miguel? She's either alive or she's not. This dude has no idea what's coming for him. We're two badass marines with an arsenal in our trunk. Let's focus and get it done. - I'm focused, Pete. I know we can win this. [whooshing] RPG! Get out! [explosion] [metal crashing] [suspenseful music] ♪ - I warned that kid. You don't mess with a man's livelihood. Drag whatever's left of them out of that car. We need proof, or we don't collect. ♪ - No bodies in here, Rex. [tense country music] - Come on, guys. - I mean, that's a lot of pretty words, but not the ones I asked for. I'm not gonna beg. I explained the rules. Bye, Jane. - Stop! You told us we'd all get a fair trial, but you didn't even listen to what she said. She did give you a confession. You should let her go. - Purging didn't fix me, Joe. It won't fix you either. - Enough! Both of you. - It won't. - And you sit down. It's not your turn to speak. Nobody's getting mercy. Everyone will answer for their sins. - What sins do I have? We've never met. What am I doing here? - You? You are everything that's wrong with this country. You're the reason we need The Purge. [bell chimes] - You know, we don't need to shop around anymore, babe. That one was perfect. - It was the most expensive one. No one should ever spend that amount on a baby crib. - [chuckles] Well, I think it's nothing but the best for the little guy, just saying. - Sheor he will be just fine without the Taj Mahal of baby cribs. - Okay, just think about it. - I'm the boss. [dramatic music] ♪ - I got the food. - You're welcome. I'm not your goddamn doorman. [scoffs] ♪ - You want to kill me for that? - Do you not understand what you did? Are you so self-absorbed that you can't grasp what your failure that day represents? You spoiled brat! There are two kinds of people in the world-- builders and takers. Workers and babies. I'm a builder. What have youever built? [groans] Your whole generation, you just take and take and take with no idea the sacrifices made, the workput into remolding our country! - My parents died for this country-- - Shut up! With a gun to your head, you can't follow a goddamn rule. You show respect! Common decency. You say "Thank you." I say "You're welcome." And you! You do not humiliate someone who's just trying to show you a good time. Ugh! - [screams] - Yes, Jane! - Go-go-go-go! - No! - [grunts] - Yes! - Come on, Jane! [both grunting] [indistinct shouting] - Get out of here! [both grunting] - Kill him! - [grunts] - No, no, no-no-no... [both straining] - Purge you. Purge you... bitch! [groaning] - [choking] - [weak gurgle] - Jane. - Come on, Jane. No. - [exhales] I'll take out the trash. And the Betancourts will be next. - We're all gonna die. - No, we're not. We're gonna figure something out. - [sobbing]
