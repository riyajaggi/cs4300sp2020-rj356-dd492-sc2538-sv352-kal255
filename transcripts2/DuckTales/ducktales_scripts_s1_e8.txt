 And that's why you don't scream while sinking in quicksand. Webby, please don't tell me how to die. Don't worry. I've read all about the ancient pyramids. I'll show you the ins and outs. Would love to focus on the outs. I was right! The tomb of Toth-Ra, Bringer of the Sun. I've been searching for decades and... Launchpad!

 Mm. Did you want a bite? This is the last of the lost pyramids. Show some respect. Sorry, Mr. McD. Oh, man! What if there's a whole army of mummies down here? Unlikely. Mummification was an expensive process meant for royalty. It'd be rare for more than one mummy... Toth-Ra was pretty rich. I bet there's at least six. Rich? What are we talking? Jewels, antiquities, what? Pharaohs from this period were typically entombed

 with treasure, servants, jars full of vital organs. Ignoring the bad parts. See you in the treasure room. Wee! Careful! That was pretty anti-climactic. Whoa! Oh, ow! What? Mummies! Behind me.

Hey, if those are mummies I'd hate to see daddies, - am I right? - Greetings, minions of Toth-Ra! We are Scrooge McDuck and family. Hey, if you guys are mummies, - then I'd hate to see... - And associates from the outside. Outsiders. We mean you no harm. If you could just show us where your - sacred treasure room is? - Oh, shh, shh, shh. You'll forgive the lad. We're just used to the mummies in pyramids being, well, eh, dead. We are not mummies. We merely dress in this manner to honor our powerful and fashion-forward leader. I am Amunet, leader of the descendants of the servants of Pharaoh Toth-Ra. For thousands of years, our families have served the pharaoh. And our society has thrived. I give you good deal. Buy my sand. Buy my sand. Buy from me! Aah! "Thrived" isn't the word I'd use. Living mummies. There's something you don't see every day, eh, Webbigail? Webby? Louie?! They must've gone down the other chute. Into the pharaoh's forbidden chamber! - Forbidden? - Oh, no! Lucky! The poor bairns must be scared out of their wits! Wee! Are we dead? Oh, is this heaven? The ruby ankh of Neferhotep! The ushabti army of Xerxes the third! A prophecy! "To those who serve the Pharaoh Toth-Ra, he brings golden reward, but beware all those who cross him." And then something I can't quite translate. Something about a curse? Being stuck here for all eternity? Fine by me! Mm, best not to touch anything until we find Mr. McDuck. - Let's go. - Or maybe we stay here. It's a room full of treasure. Scroogey's gonna find it. Good thinking. Still, don't touch... Well, hello. Anything. And that's my hut, and that's a public waste hole. They're awful close to each other. It does not smell great, but Almighty Toth-Ra decreed this is where I am to live. Oh, and here's the Temple of Toth-Ra. See here, Amunet. My kids are trapped. Now you take me to the pharaoh this instant. No need. The pharaoh will be here soon. Bless me bagpipes. Your pharaoh is... pleased. He has accepted our offering. It is time for our golden reward. I give you the Sun! Aah! - That's it? - Wait! Get back here! Great day, everyone. If we skip meals and start harvesting right now, maybe he'll bring us a full hour of sun tomorrow. You know a mummy doesn't actually bring you the sun, right? The Earth spins on its axis, creating... Aww, not the sharpest sickle in the shed, are you, kid? I got a Junior Woodchuck badge in sickle sharpening that says otherwise. - You should really leave that alone. Basic rule of treasure hunting: If it might be cursed, don't touch it. You said you weren't sure what the prophecy meant. No, but I am sure it said the golden reward is for those who serve Toth-Ra. I am serving him... by cleaning up. This place is a mess of treasure. I don't know. - Maybe we better... - Ooh! What's in this weird jar, huh? Do not look in those jars. Ooh, a kidney! Intruders! We brought that kidney from home, I swear! Let me in, you decomposing degenerate! Those who enter the pharaoh's chamber never return! - What? - Oh, no! Louie! Webby! Sorry. Too much? Isn't there some way you can help us? I suppose we could just rise up against the all-powerful Toth-Ra, bringer of the golden Sun. Yes, that! Do that! Why? We've got food, water, fresh bandages in lieu of pay, a kind and merciful god-king. What's the outside got that we don't? Toth-Ra has got you working night and day, but you barely got enough to scrape by. He doesn't bring you the sun. He keeps it from you! Sorry, it's just not our way. Don't you want to feel the sun on your face? Meh. The wind in your hair? Not really. Don't you want freedom, or glory? Launchpad! Oh, sorry. I didn't want my belly to grumble and interrupt your big speech. Like I am right now. It's bad enough you goof around during the greatest archaeological find of our time. But, eh... Oh, what is that? Oh, this burrito? Just rice, beans, cheese, your choice of meat wrapped in a delicious tortilla. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Delicious! Oh, where do we get this bo-rrito? Outside where freedom is. Bo-rritos are outside? We must have bo-rritos! Rise up against the mighty Toth-Ra! Seriously, that's what... Oh, never mind. Let's break into the temple! Yeah, burritos! Never should've ignored a prophecy. We crossed the pharaoh and now we're doomed! Silence! -Aah! But we didn't cross the pharaoh. It was just some lowly guard. Feels like a technicality. As long as you could talk, you could talk your way out. Trademark: Louie Duck. I don't know, this whole thing is a silly mistake. You were stealing treasure. I would never! I'm a new pharaoh in town. Maybe you've heard of me? Lou-Rai, master of all pharaohs. Basically, your boss' boss. You should just let us go before I get angry. He'll never buy that. Pharaoh of pharaohs, huh? There shall be none above Toth-Ra! Into the pit of eternal screams. I never thought I'd die in a pit of spikes. I mean, I always hoped. Prepare to scream eternally! Or until you hit the bottom. Wait a second! You can't do that because because I have a really good reason... and my reason is this... Because you've got to perform the proper ceremony first. I don't see any mummification tools, no book of the dead. Are you even a certified high priest? Well, no, but I... There has to be a high priest in attendance. Everyone knows that. Wh... I definitely knew that. Just check the scroll if you don't believe us. - Bye! - Hey! Wow, that was quick thinking on that phony sacrifice stuff. Oh, that was all real. Wait, you were trying to help him kill us? If I'm gonna be sacrificed I'm gonna do it right. Pretenders, get back here! At least my thing helped. Every time you ignore the rules and "pull a Louie", we end up in more trouble. Because the rules of this place are nonsense like this. Bird, bird, different bird, snake, leaf. Nonsense! Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it's... Huh. Actually, this doesn't make sense. This bird is facing the wrong way. Secret passage! Yes! All right, troops. It won't be easy, but we'll whip you into shape. Defeat that gauze-wrapped reprobate Toth-Ra, and save Louie and Webby. Show 'em what we got, boys! Good, good. Work on that shamble, Horus. Nice groan, Seth. - What is this? - What's more terrifying than an army of mummies limping towards you? You realize Toth-Ra is a mummy. Ugh. All right, back to one, people. New strategy. What do you know about Frankensteins? And then we come at Toth-Ra from both sides. But... what about his laser beam eyes? You've seen these laser eyes? No, but he is all-powerful. Fine, we cause a diversion and sneak around back. But his scarab spies will tell him we're coming. Since when does he have scarab spies? Since whenever he wants for he is Toth-Ra, the almighty, all-powerful... Uh, yeah, yeah, I get it. One, two, three, and four, - again. - That's a boy, Launchpad. Good to see you're finally taking things seriously. Fill, fold, roll, and tuck. Real burrito fillings are a lot messier than these practice ones. If you can't tuck those ends, how are you ever gonna make it through the combination menu? We're going to die down here. Now we just follow this trail and we are... - back where we started? - Louie's on it! How was your day, darling? I missed you. Stop touching everything! I'm trying to get out the way we came in. Plus, we get this sweet souvenir. Hey, I think I saw a skeleton over there. Really?! Uh, no, no. No time. The prophecy says we'll be cursed if... If we cross Toth-Ra, but that can mean anything. Besides, the dumb pharaoh isn't even here. Who dares disturb my chamber? Uh, ba... I'm Webby. Come on, let's go! Where are we going? The Pharaoh's throne room! And what are we going to do? Anything he asks! No! You're gonna stand up for yourselves while I rescue my kids. Right, but if we attack Toth-Ra, and he tells us to surrender, we should do that, right? We've spent our lives blindly serving Toth-Ra. Now we're trying to change our whole way of life for the promise of a simple bo-rrito. This is not just about - a simple burrito. - Huh? It's about all kinds of burritos. Wet burritos. - Yeah! - Breakfast burritos. Yeah! Some people even put french fries in their burritos. This is the dumbest rebellion I've ever been part of. Great, we crossed Toth-Ra by messing with his stuff and now we're done for. Oh, why do you always have to work an angle? - Good idea! - No, wait! Toth-Ra, Pharaoh Lou-Rai from next door. Hey! I am Toth-Ra, commander of the sun. Dooh, hate to pull rank, Chief, but, uh, I'm commander of the whole universe, which kind of includes the sun, so... Impossible. Uh, come forth so that I may smite you, vile pretender! No, you come over here so I can smite you. Never! You come over here because I'm going to smite you... so hard. Get away from there! Uh, I am ordering that guard to control me with my awesome pharaoh powers. Ah, fine, you got me. How is this part of the prophecy? Webby, it's not a prophecy. It's a con. How long you been running this pyramid scheme? My ancestor was Toth-Ra's personal guard. He was supposed to protect him till he awakened in here. But he never woke up. So to give everyone hope, he set up this rig so the pharaoh could fulfill his promise to bring the people their golden reward. Wait, the golden reward is just the sun? That's lame. And your family decided to keep tricking the people so they'd worship you and do your bidding. Ugh, but the prophecy! - The mummy. - All fake. I'd really appreciate it if you didn't tell anyone. Aww, don't worry, Webbs. You'll get ripped apart by a real mummy some day. Pharaoh, Toth-Ra! Your people demand freedom! To eat barbacoa! But mostly the freedom part. Now release my family! Hey, how did you... I... I mean, you dare intrude upon the pharaoh?! Loyal followers, the guard has crossed me. Take him away! Whoa! Hey-a, Mr. McDuck. Webby! Where's Louie? Be free, my people! Ooh, and pack up the treasure. It is prophesied that you will one day give it to a young, handsome duck dressed all in green. Never mind. I found him. Or just give it to me. And I shall give it to the charming, young man myself. A prophecy! I know! I just couldn't translate this last glyph. It says, "Beware all those who cross Toth-Ra... past this point." Yes! The mummy's real! Aah! Oh, great. Yeah, that's a bad thing. Louie! I'll teach you to pick on my family, you bandaged bampot! Attack! - Aah! - Aah! Mummy squad, show him what you got! Yah! Hmm. Right, this was a bad plan. I see that now. Attack plan foxtrot! - Told ya! - A coincidence. That beetle could've said anything. Enough flapping about, you towering tattie bogle! Let my children go... aah! Mr. McD! Aah! Help! I'm coming, Louie! Hmm. Huey, Dewey, stay here. Launchpad, Launchpad? No, Launchpad. Is he okay? Don't lose hope. Remember the burritos. When a burrito falls apart you got to put it in a bowl and eat it with a fork. Or, uh, grab some tortilla chips and make nachos, I guess. Uh, is any of this making sense? This was never about burritos. It wasn't? -It's about freedom to make a choice. A choice bigger than beef or veggies. We've lived our whole lives toiling in the service of the pharaoh. Now we get to choose for ourselves. And what do we want? Burritos! Wow. Okay, then. Charge! I think we got off on the wrong foot here. I could help you, you know, with a little buzz and some facetime at the right crypts I could make you bigger than Tut, man! Aah! Would you believe that this is all a dream? Fine! Look, I'm just a scared kid who talked himself into a problem that he can't get out of, okay? No more rule bending. Let's just do this your way. I am your humble servant. What can I do for you, almighty Toth-Ra? Die. - Oh, man. - Louie! If we can get him back across the seal maybe he'll stop trying to destroy everyone. How are we gonna get a ten-foot mummy back across the seal? By offering him a golden reward! Huh? Just like Launchpad taught you. Fill, fold, roll, and tuck! That's the biggest burrito I've ever seen. Aah! The sun god is angry! Everyone back inside! Oh... Never mind. So, what are you gonna do now you're free? We'll take 100 quesadillas, 55 tostadas, and 200 burrito especiales, please. Oh, well, this is embarrassing. This one's on me. That will be $9,000. - My money. - Aww, thanks, Mr. McD. I'll get you back. Then we found a secret tunnel. Then we awoke the cursed mummy. And then we almost died again. Hey, Webby, thanks for saving my life a bunch back there. I'll try to listen to you next time and not, you know, "pull a Louie." Seriously, that's a thing now? It's all about branding. Launchpad, bringer of the bo-rrito, as thanks we bestow upon ye the golden khopesh of Toth-Ra. Hey, thanks! And Scrooge, mighty warrior, as thanks for helping us see the light... pun intended, we give you this! Mm, you know, this is actually not bad at all. Delicious bo-rrito!
