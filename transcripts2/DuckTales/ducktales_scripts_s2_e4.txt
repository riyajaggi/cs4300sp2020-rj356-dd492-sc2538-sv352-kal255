 The Town Where Everyone Was Nice! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! The Feast of the Flower! A festival of food, dancing, and music that celebrates the once-a-year bloom of the the legendary Drosera Occidendum, a one-of-a-kind flower! - Never heard of it. - Me neither! A cultural tradition I know nothing about. You know how rare that is? What are you doing?

 Documenting my adventures. The people will want to feel like they were here with me. This place is going to look guh-reat on my profile. It already looks great! But now it's in sepia! Eh? Eeeehh? Oh, boy! I can't wait to see my pals! Sorry, who are these friends of yours? And why haven't we ever heard of them? And why did you all stop speaking? - And... - Please, not everything is a dark family secret. Kids, I've got a dark family secret.

 I... - Yeah? - Yeah? - Yeah? - Yeah? Was one of the Three Caballeros. - Oh! Good for you! - Yeah, Three Caba-Waba... I don't know what that is. The Three Caballeros. Donald's old college band. They practiced their polyphonic pandemonium in my garage for hours on end. Ah, the next time you complain about bagpipes, just imagine trying to sleep while your uncle saws away at an accordion. - Huh? - Huh? I was so awesome. Awk, you're find as is. A family man. A boat owner. You're more impressive than those two warbling wastrels are. Huh? A-ha! Ha ha! Oh, they are much more impressive than you. ♪ Life is like a hurricane ♪ ♪ Here in Duckburg ♪ ♪ Race cars, lasers, airplanes ♪ ♪ It's a duck-blur ♪ ♪ We might solve a mystery ♪ ♪ Or rewrite history ♪ ♪ Ducktales, whoo-ooh ♪ ♪ Every day they're out there making Ducktales ♪ ♪ Whoo-ooh ♪ ♪ Tales of derring-do ♪ ♪ Bad and good-luck tales ♪ ♪ Whoo-ooh ♪ *DUCKTALES (2017)* Season 02 Episode 04 Title: "The Town Where Everyone Was Nice!" - Ah! Ha ha! - Donald! A-ha! Squawk, crow, quack, I got your back! Secret handshake! Cool! - Mm. - Ha ha! - Saludos, amigos! Surely you remember old Panchito and José! Os patinhos! Oh, last time we saw you, you were just little eggs! Hey, remember when you insisted you could juggle the eggs? And you dropped one! Now, just who is paying for this little vacation? Ha! Scrooge. The same old miser, eh? I've taken care of everyone's stay! As a travel consultant and global tastemaker, I'm always being asked to sample the best places, the best food, the best everything! With all my jet setting, it will be nice to spend a night on solid ground. It's my agent. Hm. Again. When you are an international pop sensation, you are but a slave to fame. "Panchito, sign my baby." "Panchito, present at this awards show, and also win most of the awards." It is non-stop, my friends! But this weekend, the Three Caballeros ride again! Just like old times, eh, amigos?  Tell us everything embarrassing about Uncle Donald! Embarrassing? Your uncle was the cool one! Always off on globetrotting adventures. What are you now? A superspy? A... A world-famous DJ? Some insane combination of the two? Surely, you are super successful and impressive. Breathe. Just breathe. I've done nothing with my life! I'm a failure! Aw, that never bothered you before. Uncle Donald, you're very successful! You raised three boys and are rich in love! Isn't that the true measure of success? No! Huey, you gotta help me! Help you? Well, I have been looking to earn my Improv Theatre merit badge. How about you play the part of someone successful? Lie? Perfect! Nonsense! You do what you want, but I will not help you lie to impress that band of braggadocios. If you blow our cover, José will probably get mad and you'll have to pay for this trip yourself. Donald, we have to lie to your friends, do y'hear? Just keep it small and simple. Sorry, everyone! Uncle Donald had, uh, a very important business call! From McDuck Enterprises! My company! I'm a billionaire! The same Donald who searched our couch cushions for corn chips now owns McDuck Enterprises? Yes! And he's taking over the family business so Scrooge can retire. 'Cause he's so old! Very, very old! Because I'm so...! So old! So very, very old. Oh, Donald, is that you? Oh! My eyes are as clouded as my mind! Ow! Taking care of his uncle's legacy. A man of great wealth and kindness. Oof! "Long ago, an invading force led a bloody massacre that left the town empty. From the wreckage, a single flower grew, proving that no matter how terrible a tragedy, life will always find a way to bloom anew. Now, the town celebrates this triumph every year." Or something like that. My Portuguese is a little enferrujado. Webby, get out of the way! You're ruining my shot with your story! My story provides context for your photo! Of course! This is a moment of cultural significance. Louie, get a full body shot. Hit it! OK, look thoughtful. No, not confused. OK, don't move. That's the stuff! I know it's not on the menu, but can I get some deep-fried cassava? Oh, you have to try it. It melts right in your mouth. Please. The adventurous billionaire must have a refined palette. I'll have the kids macaroni and cheese! Eh, thanks for ordering for me, Uncle Donald. He will have the Moqueca Baiana. And more steak sticks! Aye, I'm so sorry! Here, let Panchito wipe your troubles away, which, coincidentally, is the title of my new album. A keepsake. To remember me by. Thank you. Classic Brazilian hospitality. OK, now show me how much you want that bite! Mmm, you're so hungry! Ooh, you're like a hungry bear about to go into hibernation! You need all the sustenance you can get! Perfect, yeah, no, I think I really captured the flavor. They make this pastel once a year in honor of the bloom, and you're not even going to eat it?! It's cold now. Fine! More cultural experience for me! OK, we cannot all whistle inconspicuously. Let's settle this like adults. Donald should pay, because he's the billionaire! Uh-huh. Right. Excuse me. And a nice big tip, too! Come, come, Uncle Scrooge. Let's get you some rest. Have a great day. Sorry, what was that? Have a great day. Man, everyone here is so nice! Huh? Huh! Who's excited for a tour of fascinating historical sights on the back of this noble burro? Webby is! The Brazilian dust in your eyes, the authentic smell of donkey, the saddle sores that remind you of your experience for weeks to come! You can't get that in a photo! Yeah. That's why photos are better. Oof. One more! Eeh, one more! Have a great day. OK, we'll just crop her out later. You know, just forget it. Onto the adventure of learning! Where'd they go? We missed the tour! But we got a picture. How is a picture better than a tour with Sir Reginald von Hoofy the Third? Webbigail, a wise old man once gave me this advice: "Pics, or it didn't happen." It didn't happen! But, according to this pic, it did. So wise. Remember that show we played down in Acapulco over Spring Break? The crowd! Oh, right! The crowd hated you! You hit your solo, and they hit you with a chair! He got a concussion! I did? Yeah! And you made us finish our set as we fought our way to the exit! Yes! I broke my guitar over someone's head! It was Donald's head! Ha! You did? Why don't I remember that? But, like a true musician, I kept playing, because... the show must go on! Ay caramba. What a bunch of knuckleheads we used to be. But look at us now, eh? Grown up, successful, responsible. We're not those carefree, fun-loving guys anymore. Mm? Oh! Ha! Hey! Man, I can't wait to watch this when we get home! You could watch it now! It's happening right in front of you! OK, well, I'm gonna go take a walk to soak up the real local culture. Send us pictures of anything good! Look how happy Uncle Donald is. You can't put a price on that smile. That lunch cost me $351.47. Oh, just let him have this. It's only for one weekend. What do you mean, you're getting the band back together?! Oh, people love a comeback! Think of the headlines: "Panchito Reunites with Old Friends, Rockets to a Number Somehow Higher Than Number One!" I'll talk to some of my people. Perhaps we can play na Fiesta da flor! Why stop with the festival? Donald, you can pay for a tour, right? Absolutely! No broken-down station wagons like the old days! Only the top-of-the-line! The Three Caballeros opening for Panchito Pistoles! Eh, we can work out who opens for who later. Hey, what's the big idea? Waste my money on a tour! No-good spendthrift! And you owe me for lunch! Huh? I think you've lost yourself in the role here. Maybe it's time to stop acting and tell the truth. No way! I need this! I gotta go tune my instrument. And buy an instrument. Can I...? Ha! Excuse me, señora, I am thirsty - for knowledge! Can I ask you some questions about the festival? Of course. So, how do you celebrate the bloom? Have a great day. Huh. Well, that makes sense. OK, what year was the festival established? Thank you. No, when was the first bloom? Of course. - Huh? - Have a great day. Thank you. Of course. Have a great day. Thank you. Of course. Have a great day.  Thank you. Of course. Huh? Thank you. Of course. Have a great day. Thank you. Of course. Guys, something is wrong here! Hey! You don't just take a photographer's camera... phone. You've taken 100 photos today. Why don't you have any pictures of people's feet? Because that would be weird? I... I don't...? Aha! Because they don't have any feet! Huh? Huh? - Thank you. - Have a great day. Of course. Perfect! This has to stop! No way! I'm a star. You want to stand out like your friends, I get it. But what's going to happen when you have to pay for a plane? Or a stadium. Or literally anything and you have no money! Uncle Scrooge is rich. I'll pay him back. What was that, sonny? I'm just a doddering old man who can't help you out of this mess that you've made. Aw, phooey! I'm going out there if you like it or not! Forget everything! We have to get out of here now! The festival is a trap! - The bloom - it's a giant carnivorous plant! You mean... we are the Feast of the Flower?! Oh! I just put that together. Clever. But my band! Band? Man, we do our own thing for, like, 15 minutes... The fountain wasn't a legend. It was a warning! We have to get out of here before the flower eats us all! But the show must go on? Ugh! Are you willing to risk your life to look cool for your friends? Ugh! OK! Go. I'll get the guys. We gotta get outta here! And onto the stage! Ole! The crowd is gonna eat us alive! Eh, we've played rough crowds before. Last month, a few of my more ravenous fans found me backstage and... Donald! I pulled major strings - to get us this gig! - I never cancel a performance! The audience needs Panchito! Have a great day! "Just another day in the exciting life of Dewey Duck! #Adventure #Derring-Dewey." Hashtag... Aah! Aw, that's a good one. I'm usin' it! No! Nooooo! Oh, ho, ho, hoh! I feel like the first "No" shoulda been bigger. Hang on, kids! I'm coming... Aah! You can drop the old man act now! I can't! Oh! All that pretending threw out my back! You think you're so rich, you don't need us anymore! That's not true! Do you hear the audience out there? They're screaming for us! Don't give up on our dream! Don't you want the fame, the fans? The European tour! There isn't going to be a tour. I'm not a billionaire. I'm broke! I lied to impress you. Donald, I am so disappointed in you. To lie to such successful and famous individuals... I... lied as well. I'm not jetsetter. I'm just a humble flight attendant. I cashed in all my airline points to pay for this trip. How dare you both betray me like this! I needed this tour! Because obviously, I am lying, too! I'm no superstar. I'm supposed to be performing at a child's birthday party right now. I just... I really needed something to relaunch my career. We're not so different from those college knuckleheads after all, huh? Woulda been nice to play again, one more time. - [all scream] - [plant roars Donald! Giant plant! Help! You know, this does explain why the place was so cheap. And why the brochure was printed on a leaf. I'm comin', kids! Uh-uh-uh. We have a gig to play. Are you kidding?
