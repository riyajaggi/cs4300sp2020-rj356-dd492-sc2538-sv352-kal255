 Dr. Atmozphere, It's time I... rain on your parade. Huh. You're not even trying anymore. I'm sorry. You're my third weather-based villain this month, and between the crime sprees and the public service and the... ...everything, I haven't had the chance to re-up my puns. One second. Hello? Oh, hi, Huey! No, no, don't reschedule. I need a break!

Sooo, where is this friend? Oh, Fenton is... very busy. Working... on robotics! Sorry I'm late! Fenton! There ya are! Ya just missed a Gizmoduck fly-by! You're Gizmoduck! - Huey! - I didn't say anything! Hi, I'm Webby! Nice to see you! Does your suit have a toilet?! No matter. Heroing is well and good, but today is about science! About Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera peeling back the veil of the unknown to make a discovery so revolutionary that I'll be remembered as more than just... - Gizmoduck is in the news... - And so, once again, the day is saved, thanks to Gizmoduck. Poor Fenton's worn out from saving the day every day. The tragic hero that cares for everyone... but himself. Excuse me, I'm looking for your latest birefringent beam splitters. Beam splitters, huh? Cubic or dichroic mirror? Huh? You know about dichroic mirror splitters? Yes. Because I'm a scientist. High energy physics can be challenging for a rookie. Oh, I'm no rookie. I... I'm a scientist for McDuck Enterprises, actually. Ohh, sell-out science. Pushing pencils. Wearing a suit. Brainstorming that next Gizmoduck, like we need more of that show off. W-w-wait, I... uh... W-what is it you do? Uhh, shatter expectations. Ugh. I have no rules, no limits. I don't kiss up to zillionaires. I work for myself. Actually, I'm working on my own project that's pretty neat. I haven't quite cracked the equation, but it's still very dangerous. The most dangerous kind of neat. All right, Suit. You're doing hard science? Show me your lab. Uh, yes. Uh... my lab! Th-that is mine. I'll pick you up at seven for some severe science-ing. Are they... fighting? Oh, Webby. This is the standard romantic courting of adults. Commonly known as a "meet cute." Are you sure? Fenton looks awfully sweaty. Anxious perspiration. Intense eye contact. Coy body language. Only thing we haven't seen is the awkward-yet-adorable accident. Do you want my name or address or any means of contact? Uh, yes, of course, all of it! Uh... Love is in the air! It's Gandra. Gandra Dee. Customers lining up for the new WaddleWatch got an even more exciting surprise as Gizmoduck... So, the yellow or the... yellow? You need something more formal. Like a tux. Ooh! Or a fancy cloak! I have a lab coat! You have to dress to impress! Guys, this is just a professional meeting of the minds. That could turn into a flirtation that could then blossom into a loving relationship for as long as we both shall live! But I don't want to come on too strong. So, not a date. A night of romance is just the break you need. And, if things don't go well, you can always reveal that you're Gizmoduck. No Gizmo! Just Fenton. We'll take care of everything. The lab will be perfect for your daaaate. - Not a date! - What's this about a date? - It's a little lab session with a peer. I should just be myself, right, M'ma? Oh, no. Never be yourself on a first date. Or a second. Or any dates. You have to be the best version of yourself. Here. This was your dad's. I've been saving it for a special occasion. Have a nice time, pollito. Oh and if that girl breaks your heart, I will personally hunt her down and dismantle her life. Piece by piece. So-o-o, what's this big date? - It's not a date. - Right, of course. But if it was, I'd say it's good to see you find that special someone. And that someone can be many things: a friend, a confidant, a deadly ninja, a forbidden mermaid, a were-duck, a clone of yourself... A Viking Shield-maiden, a talking cloud of energy that one time... Greetings! Nice upgrade, Suit. Yeah, you're definitely the "bad boy of science." Let's take your limo. Mine's in the shop. Get comfy! I'll have ya at your date in no time! - You know, there's no pressure. This doesn't have to be a date. You don't want this to be a date? No, it can be! I mean, I... I want it to be what you want it to be! We're just... two minds melding! Woof. ♪ It's a date! ♪ ♪ Don't let him trick ya, no ♪ My interns should be prepping the lab right now. It's a very professional work environment. Benvenuti. Welcome to Giroscopio's, a place for romance. Prego, prego, prego! Please, follow me. This is your lab? How do you get anything done with all this moody Italian decor? Yeah, this is not... Bonjourno, can I a-tell you about tonight's a-special? - It's spaghetti! - Please order it. It's the only thing we made. Where is Dr. Gearloose? Oh, we took good care of him. You will rue the day! What was that? The, uh, Crackshell-Cabrera Talk-In Closet! Will you excuse me a second? This a disaster! She's not into romantic accoutrement. She's into science! According to the JWG, mood is essential. Without it, how will you two develop chemistry? With actual chemistry! Ugh! What do you want? Hey, so, I don't like you not answering my calls. It makes me feel like I'm not the only person in the world, which is weird for me. I'm inside the lab, OK? I want results, Agent D. You imbeciles! It's a trap! They're trapping u... A real scientist always gets results. We need to get rid of this stuff. Is this spaghetti tied together? You're supposed to eat it, then meet in the middle for a kiss! And I'll be ready to capture the tender moment! End of the night, we hand out souvenir photos! Just science and me and her and... the moonlight. Beaks, stop calling! The serum I made won't work unless we can get a recording of Fenton saying the passcode: "blathering blatherskite." Those are not everyday words. But I can't wait! I'm sick of Gizmoduck always getting all the attention! Ugh! He thinks he's so noble! Just be patient! Beaks... eh duh-nuh do patient. Sorry about my interns' odd behavior. They're still under the effects of a toxic gas leak. That I assure you has now been vented. Been there. Once, I accidentally unleashed a nanobot infestation on my apartment building. Holy Marconi! I tried to explain a protonic reversal could negate the receptors. But people don't want to listen to science. They called me... - A kook. - A menace. - A crack... pot. - A crack... pot. Ms. Dee, shall we science? Tasty Spray! Just spritz any food with this and it tastes just like glazed donuts! Like so... Mmm... glazy! Mmm mm-hm? What if you don't like glazed donuts? What kind of monster doesn't like glazed donuts? You really wanna see something? Look into my eyes. - Yes. It's happening. - Mm! Eye Buds. Upgrades the eye into a wireless camera. Well, set those Eye Buds on this! The Universal Solvent! The future of terraforming as we know it. This liquid eats through anything. Only the strongest diamonds are resistant. So, Rich Boss McDuck gets to gobble up all of the Earth's precious gems for himself. What's next, some kinda gold magnet? Here. Take my hand. Do you feel that spark? Aaah! - What was that?! - Nanites. Microscopic robots. They channel my body's electricity into usable external power. You experimented on yourself? That's incredibly dangerous! I know! Most of these pencil-pushers just theorize and talk... Uh, what's the word? Yada yada? Blah blah blah? Mm, babbling? Blathering? Ugh, just one word? Uhh, this is taking forever! OK, clearly, Papa needs to take matters into his own hands. Uh, drop a beaks! ♪ Don't let him trick ya ♪ ♪ No, no ♪ ♪ It's a date ♪ ♪ Don't let him trick ya No, no ♪ ♪ It's a date ♪ ♪ Don't let him trick ya No, no ♪ - ♪ Don't, don't, don't ♪ - Access denied. What, no signal? Boo! OK, you want punk science? You want ripping the fabric of the universe and bending the elements to your very will? My top secret personal project. Behold! Fentonium! A frictionless synthetic crystal of my own design! Instead of slowing down after an initial bounce, it actually speeds up and gains energy! Ada Dovelace, that's amazing. Imagine that potential unleashed! And incredibly unstable! Heh. I still need to crack the equation or it could tear the lab apart. An innovative energy generator from a mild-mannered source. Like I said. Neat, right? Yeah. You kinda are. Hungry, Suit? OK, OK, they're hungry. Let's move, people! Webby: camera. Manny, Bulb: music. Me, Huey: food. Order up! Mwah! It's really working! The spaghetti got untied! Fenton's perfect date! I need a distraction! Gandra's a spy for Mark Beaks! This was all about her trying to get some passcode from Fenton. What?! There's nothing in the romance chapter about spies! Ohh, this is gonna shatter Fenton's self-esteem! Also, he could be captured by spies! Two bad things could happen! Scusi, you have a phone call. Guys, it's going really well! Gandra's brilliant and charming and a little critical, just like my mother and Gyro and pretty much everyone else in my life. Most of all, Gandra doesn't care about Gizmoduck, she likes me! And you guys are just staring. Why are you staring? Um... You're... lookin' good out there, tiger! Huey! We have some bad news. You know, I wasn't so sure about you. But I like this. You sure you wouldn't like anything else? I spy the server right there. I can Waddle over and get his attention. Oh! Uh... no, no, no, no, no. Uh... But hey! How about a second date? We could do a picnic or get some fresh air. Go fly a... oh, what are those things called? The toy that Ben Frankloon tied to a key? I know what you're here for! Gizmoduck. Just like everyone else. There's a feeling man with feelings under that synthetic alloy shell! Whaat? You're Gizmoduck? You know I am! Who doesn't? Blathering Blatherskite. Is this what you want?! That's exactly what I want. You may have the suit, but I have something better. A full body upgrade! That's right. I drank Dee's nanite serum and linked it up with stolen Gizmotech. I just needed your passcode to boot it up. Blathering Blatherskite. Oh, this feels gross! Ugh! This is normal, right? Right? Did you drink more than one of the serum vials? Yes, I told you I was bored! Yaah! Aaand boom! Bigger than Gizmoduck! It's Mega-Beaks! Oh, and you're all incredibly dead. All right. Which huge muscle should I use to destroy what first? You've always been a monster, but now you are a literal monster. Huh? Mmm... Mm! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aaah! Wait, did I just eat the pie tins? Huh! Aah! Aah! Yaah! Yuck! Glazed donut! Whoa! Go. Find cover. This date is a disaster. Fenton's gonna be crushed. Fenton's going to be crushed! Ha-ha-ha! Hi, amigo. Ehh! Bye, Beaksy. I'm sorry, Suit. I've got your kids! Maybe. I'm not sure how this family works. But don't even think about following me! Ugh! That idiot! So I'm the Suit? You're the one working for Beaks! I work for myself. I just used him for funding and resources. For what? Was any of this real? What are you? A scientist! Free of responsibility. And look, for what it's worth... You're a good scientist. And you're a crook. Come on, come on, come on! OK, you don't have the suit. What can you do? Think, Fenton, think! #MakeltRain! How is this a part of your plan? I wanted to up my visibility. You don't get more visible than being a giant monster! You ruined Fenton's date! Where is your heart, man? In here somewhere, under all these righteous pecs! Pla-plow! Heh, huh... Ow! Ow. Who's doing that?! Call me Fenton! Wow. I never actually caught a ball before. Well, who's the loser now, Coach Dad?! Yaah! - Gandra?! - Hurting puny, helpless heroes was not part of our deal, Beaks. Gonna focus on the hero part. - Are you OK? - I... I can't shock him anymore. His nanite-enhanced skin is too tough! Yeah, but what matters is inside. Under all that, he's still the same weak, ego-fueled dweeb. Ugh, heroes. Always with the morals. No, I mean inside, he's weak! You can stop, Beaks! Look! You're trending worldwide! I wanna see! I wanna see! Huh... huh? Aah! I can't use a phone. I can't use a phone! No-o-o-o! Huh? Uhh! - Yes! Wha...! - Yahoo! Fenton did it! And without the Gizmoduck armor! Webby, there is no Gizmoduck without the noble Fenton underneath... I want to come down! Help! Oh, no, the kids! Gandra, we gotta... Huh? Wait. She did it. Ready to come down anytime now! Stabilization up 53%! You. What do you think you're doing here? Shouldn't you be Gizmoducking around out there? Not today. I'm needed here. Scientist at work. Hm.
