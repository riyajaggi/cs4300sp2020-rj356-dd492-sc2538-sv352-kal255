Uncle Scrooge, remember how great you felt when I came back from the moon after all those years? All the unconditional love? More than you'll ever know, lass. I'll remember that feeling always. Great. I need you to really hold on to that feeling.

 Curse me kilts! Is that the Spear of Selene?! You promised you wouldn't be mad. The rockets touched down just minutes ago. It's still not clear what they want, but authorities urge everyone to remain calm... Come on, Carl. All of Duckburg watches as authorities send in their top man. Okay, Fenton, it's just first contact with life from beyond the stars. Momentous. Cosmically historic. Totally manageable. Uh, hi! We're Earth. And you are? Mm-mm! Mmm... Oof! Maybe I misheard Penny's invasion warning. Lot of static in space. Gizmoduck, watch out! Ha-ha! We are the mighty! We are the Moon! Aw, phooey. Huh? Run! Run! Look out! Faster, Beakley! The Bin is the most secure place in town. Dewey, this is it. Saving Earth is my dew-stiny. Come face the chosen one! Nerp. Why are they doing this?! They liked me so much! Enough! I have a plan. Gyro! It's time. Unleash... the Unstoppa-Bomb. The Moonlanders, um, already found that and stopped it. What? Uh, alright, then... Activate the Doomsday Ray. That was like, the first thing they took out. Okay. I swore I'd never have to initiate our worst weapon... And you never will, because they destroyed that too. This was a very well-planned invasion. Greetings, puny Earthers, I am General Lunaris of the vastly superior Planet Moon. The moon's not a planet... Yeah, it's a whole thing with them. For too long, my people have lived in fear of your Earth hanging in the sky. The time has come for the Earth to fear us. I now wish to speak to Scrooge McDuck. "Smarter than the smarties," eh? Heh. Perhaps on Earth. You scurrilous space scoundrel! You've probably just realized that I've taken out your defenses. And you've retreated to the strength of your impenetrable "Money Bin". What you don't know is that family... But as we all know, your family is the greatest strength of all. Which is why I'm coming for them next. Lunaris... has arrived. We need to call for help. Unless Lunaris took down our communication satellites too. Uh, no. Louie did. That was last week! I didn't know there'd be an alien invasion this week. I may have a solution. Lil' Bulb's Bulb-Tech operates on its own network. They can talk to each other like walkie-talkies. Find our allies! Go, children. Like the wind! Uncle Scrooge, Lunaris is coming for our family. We have to do something. Kids! Great news. We're gonna heroically face-off against the enemy? Better! While Gyro's Bulbs search the town for fighters, we're gonna search the globe! I need Webby's skills, Dewey's gusto, Huey's know-how, and Louie? I need you to see the angles I can't. I won't let you down, Mom. To the Cloudslayer! C'mon! Mr. McDee needs me! Why won't this start? Oh, right... fire. I am the terror that flaps in the night! I am the scream you can hear in space! I am... Anything dangerous in there? Nah. Just some purple weirdo. Move out! Whaddyamean, purple weirdo?! Darkwing! You saved me! This is Scrooge McDuck, calling all forces to the Bin! Ah, a call to action. The city needs a savior and... Repeat, all forces to the Bin. Good idea. You be my ears so I can focus on defending the people. This is Scrooge McDuck, calling all forces to the Bin! This is Scrooge McDuck, calling all forces to the... What the craters is this? Huey to Uncle Scrooge. Our top secret mission is underway. Good thing this is a secure line or the Moonlanders would know we're in... I repeat, we are approaching Egypt. And our first stop: the Temple of Toth Ra! Ugh! We'll bring Amunet's army of living mummies back to Duckburg. My sources tell me our pal Djinn is in the area too. A regular ol' twofer. Good thinking. All part of the plan. Huey, got those bulb phones ready? Mm, yeah... Working on it! There's the pyramid! Perfect. We swoop down, pick up our forces, and get back to Duckburg... before the invasion can... ..spread. - H'boy. - H'boy. - H'boy. - H'boy. - H'boy. No. No. Djinn, Amunet, it's Huey Duck. You guys okay down there? We'll be fine! Moon, Sun, or the North Star itself, nothing will prevent me from upholding my... Ooh! My haunches! Don't worry, we're coming for you! Where are the rest of your people? Safe in the pyramid. Dewey, Webby, watch for lasers. Mom, take us down! No, Ma, lower. Go down. No, the pyramid's the other way. There's no place to land. There's a spot. There's another spot. In fact, it is mostly flat desert out there. Djinn and Amunet can't hold back them much longer. The Moonlanders will invade the pyramid! But... what about the plan? Reinforcements and...? We'll find them some place... safer. I can't believe we defeated a sun god only to be attacked by moon people. If only there was some kinda, I don't know, moon god. Or goddess! To Ithaquack! We could sternly ask them to leave. Buddy, you are a waste of magic. Simple solution: clone army. Why are we even still talking? I'll get the clone spray. Meantime, we throw Gizmoduck out there as a decoy. You hurt him, I hurt you. Ha-ha! Thank you for your concern, random citizen! Fenton, I'm a detective and your mother. I know you're Gizmoduck. M'Ma! Secret identity. What we need is a symbol to strike fear in their hearts. Smoke bomb. An unknown figure appears. Who's that? Lightning! Chaos! Drama! They surrender immediately to Darkwing Duck! I'm sorry, who is that? Hi, I'm Gizmoduck. When there's trouble, you call me. What's your name? Guys, guys, I got it! What we need... is a plan. And that plan is Darkwing. No one ever won a battle by squabbling. We need to stand united under one foolproof plan. Ahem. Lunaris did defeat your first three foolproof plans. Aye. And he thinks we're running scared. The last thing he expects is for us to run at him. Yeah, cause it's crazy. I know every inch of that mansion. If I can get up there, I can sneak onto Lunaris' ship and take him down. But we need a distraction: our army will attack his army head-on. I'm sorry, what army? My great-grandfather used to say, "Give me 12 highlanders and a bagpiper and I'll give you a rebellion." We may be a ragtag gang of underdogs, but we'll survive like we always do. Because we're smarter. We're tougher. We're sharper. Follow my lead, and we'll win this battle square! Ah, no... Stop... I am man, you are machine. Ow! Get off me! Hello? Selene? Goddess of the Moon? Open the ding-dang-door, ya pantheon of palookas! We'd love to help you, but we're kinda grounded. Father, please! What of the Earth? What of my Donald?! No! We are not helping Scrooge McDuck. If the mortals jumped off a bridge, would you jump too? Yes, Father, for I am immortal! Please, let us in! So we can figure out a plan to stop the Moonlanders. We need to hide! ...our plan from spies so maybe we can talk it over on the plane back to Duckburg? We can't ever go back to Duckburg! Without you! I think? Sorry, Mom, I'm a little lost here. Trust me, it's the plan. You don't need to know every part of the plan, but it's a great plan. Is part of the plan saying "plan" a lot? Look, what's going on here, Mom? Sorry! Call me later, we'll hang out if we're not all conquered? Sir, we've secured the only path to the mansion. No one's getting through. Very good. It's all falling into place. Ugh. He's launching some kind of horrible sonic warfare! Stick to the plan. Everyone hold, until I give word. Hold. Hol-lllld... Oh, no. Sorry, everyone! Oh, no. Oh. Oh, okay... There we go. Oh, fine! Just go! Launchpad and, uh, purple guy... Actually, it's Darkwing... No time! Drive! Yow! - M'Ma! - I got him! You're embarrassing me in front of the rebellion. These aren't some bank robbers. It's an invasion! What are you gonna do, pollito? Cream them. Mmm! What is this delicious flavor? Lemon merengue. Harpies love it. Not bad, Gizmopollito. Yeah! Ah! Dr. Gearloose! Don't worry. That was a clone. Okay. That might have been me. None of us really know anymore. Chaaarrge! Mr. McDuck, I don't know how much longer we can hold them! Trust me, Beakley, it's going just as planned! I am the black hole that... I am the supernova that... Can you slow down please? Nonsense! I have to get to Lunaris before he realizes I'm missing from the battlefield. But if no one knows we're coming, well, how can they be terrified of me? For the last time, you ignominious egomaniac, they're not scared of you. Oh. They barely even notice you. Okay. We can get to the Dawson Mines. Ooh! Or the caves of Mt. Neverrest! But those places are abandoned. I thought we were looking for recruits to fight Lunaris! I'm sure Mom's just, ya know, looking to set up a second base to attack from? Huey! Don't worry. The hero of Earth's here to save you. And Webby is here to save me. Dewey-Ex Machina! Oof. We have to go back to Duckburg. The plan's not working. We had a chance to get Amunet and Djinn, but we ran away. And back at Ithaquack you were more worried about getting us in than getting reinforcements out. It's almost like... The plan isn't about finding help. It's about running away. We're being scammed! Lunaris is targeting us. If I told the truth, you wouldn't have come. So we don't fight back? We leave our friends and family? You're my family. I can't lose you again! Almost... there and... There's Scrooge McDuck! Forget him! Get Scrooge! Halt, Earther! Who's this? I am sharper than the sharpies. I am tougher than the toughies. I am Scrooge McDuck! Ooh, impressive entrance! Huh? And now prepare your... Where did he...? How did he...? Oh! DW, are you okay? They finally paid attention to me. I am a hero! I am... Who am I? Darkwing Duck! Alright. I'm about to show you who's really smarter than the smarties. There you are. Took long enough. You see, Scrooge, my father taught me that fear is a powerful weapon. Fear can motivate the Moonlanders to invade your planet. Fear can make the ridiculous people of Earth put their faith in a foolish old man's foolhardy plan. Fear can drive away Della, the one Earther with any knowledge of my people. Fear can even distract the great Scrooge McDuck as I landed this planetary engine! Uh, behind you. It's time your pathetic Earth revolved around the moon! You'll never get away with this. I just did. No visible sign of life. We're heading back to Duckburg. Uh, we made it. We're safe! And stuck. You'd have to be pretty unlucky to be stranded here. What? Donald? Della! Hot dog! We've got company! - Where have you been? - Where have you been? If you were home when I got back, you'd know I was stuck on the moon... Which, by the way, is invading us! I know! I warned you! We didn't get a warning! Stop yelling at each other! I could've been named Turbo! You owe me 11 years of Turbo! Don't change the subject! Just because I missed you doesn't mean I'm not mad at you! I missed you too, ya big dummy! Aw, boy, I love a reunion! Has the melon been a thing the whole time I've been gone or...? No, that's new. Maybe if I... Oh, no, he'll take us out here... Okay, what if I...? There you are! I thought we were meeting at Thumbs, not Chums, because I wrote the name of the emergency meeting place, Chums, on my thumbs. You can understand the mix-up. Also everyone's been captured by Moon guys. Grrrrr... Blasted tartar sauce! Uh, is he okay? He's... strategizing. Everything's fine. Sure, we had an army before and now there's only an elite squad of five. Four. I've decided you're doomed. My time would be better be served preparing your places in the afterlife. Cheerio! Not reassuring that he went down instead of up. Well, wherever Della and the kids are, at least they're together. Thank goodness you found us! After Penumbra helped Donald escape those evil Moonlanders, why, he crash landed on this island. Where I met my best friend! You met Penny on the moon? Is she okay? I miss her constantly trying to impale me. We've been having a real good time. Sharing sandwiches, drinking sea water smoothies to drown our sorrows... You've been surviving on sea water and sand this whole time? But now I'm saved! You must have been searching for him for months! Yes. We totally knew you were missing and not on a cruise. - Did we? - Yes. - Just like the melon said. - That's why we're here. I told you your family would never forget about you! Which is why you have to go back, my friend. Lunaris is a monster. We have to go help Uncle Scrooge. And now that we found you, we can all fight Lunaris together! No way. The plan is to keep you as far away from danger as possible. Besides, Scrooge knows exactly what he's doing. Ugh, I have no idea what I'm doing! I cannae see how to beat Lunaris. Every plan I come up with, he's one step ahead! I'm afraid there's no sane way to stop him. Screech! You all know me. Know how I make my living. You don't need a plan. You need a scheme. A cockamamie one. What the blazes are you doing here? Didn't your last scheme backfire so badly you lost your fortune to a child and turned literally every villain in town against you? And I survived! Like a Scottish cockroach! And you can survive too, if you listen to ole Flinty. Well, we are all out of good ideas. Yes! Ta-daaaaa! Welcome home! We can live here as long as we need! Look, kids, you have your own rooms! So let's see, we've got this tree, sand and water. Whole lot of both. How can this get us home? Oh! Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh! Keeping in mind Dewey can't surf us to safety because he does not know how to surf. We don't know that until I try! Welcome back! Who's up for beach volleyball?! Melon, I'm looking at you! 'Cuz we're gonna need a ball. - No! - We don't have time for games. We need to get back to Duckburg. It's too dangerous. We don't know what's waiting for us back there. But the Earth needs our help. Scrooge will handle it! And how are we supposed to survive? It's fine! Everything's fine! We got a bunch of sand, zero contact with the outside world, a crashed plane we can use as a house, and... Hey! Shoo! Monster taking my stuff! Ah! Heh. Living here is great! No offense, Mom, but we might as well be living on the moon. What? You must be delirious from hunger. Here, have some delicious Oxy... chew... Oh, no. No-no-no. This is the moon all over again! See ya real soon! Noooo! A Glomgold Industries Scheme, a subsidiary of McDuck Enterprises. Things are bad. Lunaris is manning a rocket full of lasers in the bay pushing the Earth out of orbit. That's causing the Earth to freeze. Our army is being held captive. But Earth still has its heroes. Some bigger than others, I see... Sorry, do you not want to survive? Are we honestly going to trust this maniacal knock-off? Lunaris has a counter for every one of my plans. What else are we to do? Surrender and freeze to death? Well, it does seem less painful than this. This is our last hope, people. If you all blindly follow my plan, we may have a chance. Thanks to my ultimate weapon! Is that shark wearing a parka? I call it a Sharka! Because Papa doesn't want his precious babies getting sick. No, I don't. Ah! I'm going to miss being a planet. Hey, Mom. I drew this back when I had to imagine what you boys looked like. I think you really nailed Dewey. On the moon, all I could think about was being your mom. The adventures! The fun! I wasn't prepared for all this. Look, I hate surprises. I like seeing every angle of a situation so that I can take control of it. But you can't plan for everything. Sometimes a robot boy uses you as a piñata. I think I'm losing the thread here. But sometimes the mom you thought you lost comes back. And that's a surprise too. So you deal with the bad surprises because they may lead to a good one. But what if Lunaris succeeds? What if I lose you again? What if...? You know, when I'm terrified, which is often, I try to remember this old song. ♪ Face each new sun with eyes clear and true ♪ ♪ Unafraid of the unknown... ♪ ♪ Because I'll face it all with you ♪ I wrote that song before I got lost. How did you hear it? Well, Uncle Donald used to sing it to us when we were little. That's true. I read that. That's a pretty good surprise. Let's go face the unknown together. So any ideas on how to get back or...? Ahoy there! Mitzi? Cousin Gladstone?! Cousin Fethry?! Della? Donald? Huey? Dewey? Green kid? Girl kid? Airplane? Palm tree? Mmm... Hey, fam! Want some melon? ...luckily my blimp was blown clear of the invasion and out to sea. That's where Fethry and the lovely Mitzi found me. And just as I was getting peckish, we saw these melons floating in the ocean, which led us here. Crazy, huh? This is delicious! You want some, Donaldo? You guys need a lift? Aw, man, am I the Uncle Donald? Go, my babies! Eh, let me get this straight. The "Sharkas" eat through - the tower supports under the ice. - Obviously. And Beakley is dressed like this why? How else would we convince Lunaris that this giant slingshot is normal sized? Ever heard of an optical illusion?! Ugh. It's gettin' real hot in here. Ooh! Ah! Right, because Lunaris will think she's just a... little boy, allowing her to fire Launchpad, who is a rock, up to the tower's control room and shut it down. Now you're gettin' it, Scroogey. And, uh, what's my part in this? You'll distract Lunaris by pretending to be the one person no one would ever suspect of deceiving them. A man who everyone lets into their home, without question. No. No! You're only doing this because you know I'll hate it. Glomgold, you've gone too far! You animal! The thing he hates the most! Right. And how many of your plans worked? I can't believe my father feared these Earthers. They're pathetic. What the moon devil is this? Water beasts in winter clothing? Surely it would only weigh them down? Preposterous. Is that Scrooge's housekeeper holding a man dressed as a rock? This is sad, even for Scrooge. Unless... he wants me to think that. An idiotic cover for a secretly brilliant strategy. Oh, what am I not seeing? Ho. Ho. Ho. Merry invasion. Scrooge, please. Whatever this "plan" you have is, it's embarrassing us both. Oh, it's not my plan. "You have to talk to the greatest, "most handsome, tenacious, honest, and noble boy on the tippity top of the Nice List..." Flintheart Glomgold! I'm sorry, who is this? Nice try, Moonman... Pretending not to know Earth's greatest mastermind! "Glomgold, my boy! "Santa has a special present just for you! Takes out present." Oh. "I'm giving you your company back!" Wait, what?! Of all the... Was this whole thing a scheme to get me to give up your company?! Ha! No take backs on Christmas! It's not Christmas! Then why is Santa here?! Enough! No more tricks. What is your plan?! Is this part of it?! Bless me bagpipes. Flinty, I think it's working. Of course it is! What is working?! What did you just do with your hand? I was a guy this whole time! What?! No! You were prepared for our best. But not our dumbest. And I'm the dumbest there's ever been! Wait... How is this possible? I will not be stopped! Earth shall bow to my will! Oh, go, Glom! Go! Ah! Phew. No! You will live in fear of me! I am the mighty! I am the Moon! Greatest of the planets... Oof! The moon's not a planet! Stop. Saying. That! Any last words, Earther? Hi, kids. Huh? - Hi, Uncle Scrooge! - Hi, Uncle Scrooge! - Hi, Uncle Scrooge! - Hi, Uncle Scrooge! None of this makes any sense! Uh, no! Pull, Mitzi! Pull! Looks like we're out of luck. Buh? Oh! Oh! Hey! No! No! My plan is crushed! About time you came home! I hope you had a relaxing vacation while the rest of us were defending the planet! Oh, was he not on a cruise then? If the Earthers won't live in fear of the moon, then they'll die in fear of it! So, you guys got it from here, right? After I blow up the Earth, then you won't be a planet! He wouldn't blow us up, right?! Sorry, he's gonna blow up where now? Wait, are we the bad guys? Don't I owe you kids a trip into space? What? Who would dare?! Alright, we have to take out that engine before he hits Earth. Yes, sir. Ow! Grr... Ugh! But I can't near that engine while his laser turrets are on! Kids, knock out those lasers! Dewey, you aim, I'll fire! Yeah! Move over! This is a ship. I am a sailor. This is a rocket ship, genius. I'm a pilot! Oh, bless me bagpipes, have I missed this. Dewey! Give me a turn. One more round and we can knock out that engine! Ah, there's that indomitable Earth spirit. Can't wait to crush it like I'll crush your planet! Ha-ha! There's no escape this time! What are you doing?! I can't find an angle out. Farewell, Della Duck. Penumbra?! Hello, General. Hiya, roomie! Penny! Didn't see that one comin'! Anyway, this is my family, you know Donald... Let me in! Oh, right. No! I will not be defeated. I've planned for every eventuality. Back up engines, activate! I said activate! That's an order! Why won't you...? What the...? Hey, Selene here, Goddess of the Moon. Probably heard of me. So, my brother Storkules is setting the Earth back into orbit as we speak. Ah-ha! Bad news... your ship is stuck orbiting the Earth. Oh, no. Not that. Not... But good news: Congratulations! You're the Earth's newest moon! Aw, phoooeeeeeey! Huh? So, um, cool crash. I don't suppose you'd like to grab a coffee or something... I could destroy you easily. So, yes? Glomgold! Glomgold! Glomgold! Glomgold! Glomgold! Glomgold! I did it! I defeated Scrooge McDuck! We were on the same team! Well, we survived that, so what do we do now? I dunno. But we'll do it together. This has gone too far. The Ducks almost cost us the world today. And without the world, who would we larceny against? The pieces are finally in place. Time to come out of the shadows, take control, and end Clan McDuck. If the McDuck family wants an adventure... we'll give them their last.
