 Legacy. Passing the torch to a new generation. The knowledge of the old mixes with the discoveries of the new into that flavorful gumbo called tomorrow. You are that gumbo. Welcome to the Calisota Junior Woodchuck Graduation! The legacy is alive! Why isn't Donald wearing his Junior Woodchuck uniform? Oh, he was kicked out because he's got a... ...bad attitude about nature. Ow.

 These Woodchucks... gesture to stage... are a part of a tradition of Woodchuck excellence: like legendary explorer Isabella Finch. Point to paintings. Note: Launchpad, do not read these parts. Grape jelly stain. Mmm. Today, Junior Junior Woodchucks become Junior Woodchucks. Junior Woodchucks become Senior Junior Woodchucks. And of course, a Woodchuck's proudest achievement is making the rank of Senior Woodchuck. A Senior Woodchuck goes above and beyond to make themselves and everything around them better.

 This is my moment. This year, I am pleased to announce our star candidate! Congratulations to my close personal friend... - Violet Sabrewing! - Oh, uh... Sorry I'm late... I was helping an elderly woman cross the street. Whoo! That's my sister from a couple misters! Thank you. You're a Junior Woodchuck? But I haven't seen you at any Jamborees or Fun- Time Functions. I prefer to focus my time on the real work of Woodchucking. And this year we have a second candidate for Senior Woodchuck. Dewey's brother! - That's my kid! - Second is the best! As is our solemn custom, in the event of two candidates, our competitors will go head- to- head in the most intense physical and mental trial of their skills: The Junior Woodchuck Wilderness Challenge! There can only be one Senior Woodchuck! Huh, neat! Violet! Violet! Violet! Violet! Violet! Violet! Violet! ♪ Life is like a hurricane here in Duckburg ♪ ♪ Race cars, lasers, airplanes, it's a duck- blur ♪ ♪ Might solve a mystery or rewrite history ♪ ♪ DuckTales, whoo ♪ ♪ Everyday they're out there making DuckTales, whoo ♪ ♪ Tales of derring- do, bad and good luck tales, whoo ♪ *DUCKTALES * Season 03 Episode 01 Episode Title: "Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!" Aired on: April 03, 2020 - Ow! - How'd this happen? If I'm not the best Junior Woodchuck, who am I? You're still a great Junior Woodchuck! You're also great. You're gonna win this easy! He just needs more encouragement right now. Ya know what, nothing can stop me with my trusty Junior Woodchuck Guidebook in my... Uh- uh. No Guidebooks allowed during the challenge. Eh, who needs a big book of rules, am I right? Huey! Huey needs a book of rules! I think what Dewey is trying to say is that you were born for this! Now get out there and show the other nerds that you are king nerd! Come on, Hubert, a Woodchuck mustn't be late. Violet, Violet, Violet, Violet! Ooh, who's this lady? Isabella Finch! Adventurer? Chief of Woodchuck Exploration? Chronicler of the Unknown?! She was a legend to me growing up. Cue story about Scrooge as a lad in three, two, and... When I was a lad, I only had money for a single pulp adventure book, but boy did it count: The Collected Adventures of Isabella Finch. I spent many a late night reading about how she bested the Fever Beast of Tibet or swatted the Swiss Swarmy of Microbeesia! Wow! This woman made history and deserves the utmost respect. What? She hid this map here for future adventurers to find! Ooh. Twist! And here on Woodchuck Island, Finch hid her greatest treasure, surrounded by the deadliest obstacles she found on her journeys. Her greatest adventure will become our greatest adventure. Who knows what the treasure could be? The Ruby of Rangoon? The Golden Bullion of Gorrión? The... Oy! Do you mind?! I'm speechifying! That's better. Where was I? Ah, yes. Listen to the song of adventure calling you! What? It's so catchy. This course will test every aspect of your Junior Woodchuck knowledge. You will place these flags on designated trail markers like so. As you make your way north, to the highest point on the island. At the mountain's peak, whoever plants their final flag first will become the next Senior... uh... Senior Woodchuck! Ready? I was born ready. If you are as prepared as a helpless baby then I will beat you easily. Apologies. Lena told me that friendly "smack talk" is expected in competitions such as these. Call him a clown! Clown! Hey! May the best Woodchuck win. Likewise. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! When you don't have a compass... make one! Now I just have to find north and... ahh... place the first trail marker! Good job, Huey! Already in the lead! Oh? "Hubert: Who is in second place and holding this letter? You are! Best wishes, Violet." - What the...? - Was that good smack? Do you feel appropriately razzed? We're on the exact path Finch took in her very last adventure! Now let's stick to her... What is this bird doing here? Giving me the irresistible urge to bust several moves! Aw, they're both so cute! All right, don't get distracted. Back to the real adven... oof! This is sacred, hallowed history. Not at all funny. - Ugh! Stupid nature! - It's just a mosquito! You should give it some of your blood! Hey, we were just getting a flow going! Come back! Where are you going? That's not Finch's path! Junior Woodchuck Rule 38: When you hear thunder, it's time to get under... cover? Hmm. But stopping would put me behind. No problem! A little rain never hurt any... ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Lightning rain! Oh! Oh! Rubber plant! Yeah! Ow! Stupid stretchy leaf! Ow! Ow! You need to sever the rubber leaf at the base. Yes. Thank you very... ow... much. I knew that. Ow! Very well. Now eat my dust! That was the smack talking. Ow! Easy, Hue. The Guidebook says every setback is an opportunity for... aah!... growth. Ugh! Why would rain ever be made of lightning?! This is the Lightning Rain of Chimpopo. Ol' Isabella braved a 183- day lightning rain with only grit, determination, and the hat on her head! She had a hat?! Come now. We are walking in the footsteps of a giant! - Aw. - Not a literal giant. Yup... blang it! See, Donald? Aah! Nature's not so... blaaah! That's it, rain! Aah! Quiet, everyone! I think my quirky new sidekick is trying to tell me something. Of course. Huh? What's that? You want us to follow you on a brand- new adventure? Well, let's go! But, but, but we're already on a perfectly good adventure! ♪ Put aloe on your ouchies ♪ ♪ Prevents the mean and grouchies ♪ Ahh. See? I don't need the most badges to prove I'm the best Woodchuck. All I need is my wits, a little know- how and... I am lost. OK. "When lost, a Woodchuck retraces their steps." But then I'll fall even farther behind. And then I'll lose. No Guidebook, no map, no clue, no Guidebook, no hopes, no chance, no Guidebook! I'll just go to the Guidebook in my mind! Manic Episodes, Mass Hallucinations, Mental Breakdowns, Moss... I reckon you're searchin' for "Navigational Techniques." This is new. My name is J. W. Guidebook, the Junior Woodchuck Guidebook in your mind! I'm here to help you out, teach ya a thing or two about nature... and yourself. Uh- huh. Yeah. I reckon you want to track your direction by the sun. Hey. That's right! Just set down a stick and follow the shadow. Ha! I'd like to see Violet conjure a talking book from her psyche. You're gonna do it, Huey. Just you and nature and... Well, that is a pickle of a different color. Stay calm, remember your trainin'. Make yourself big and intimidatin'. Skedaddle, boy! That bear don't care for book learnin'! Come on, Huey! You know what to do. Book, what do I do? Me Rule 8 Number 43: If a bear you spy, string your food up high. I don't have any food, except... That's it! I'm the food! Attaboy! That's some real Senior Woodchuck thinkin'. Ha ha! There's the next marker! Let's see Violet pull... this... off. Hubert. Violet?! No! If it makes you feel better, Lena says that first is the worst, and second is the best. Though factually that's wrong by any metric! Violet! No! No more climbing points. I appear to be stuck. Me Rule 17: A Woodchuck looks out for their fellow Woodchucks, whatever the cost. You could toss down a rope. Ooh! Or, uh, weave a cushy net out of peat moss! - Or... - Y'know. I bet if I make it to the final checkpoint first, there'll be someone there who can help. I could win the challenge and look out for my competitor. I suppose there's no rule against it, but... Be right back! Hey, where ya goin'? Hubert! Wait! Was it because of my razzing? Curse my flawless slams! Junior Woodchuck Rule 732: Respect nature and nature will respect you. Once again, nature provides! All right. If we turn back now, we can still brave the Devil's Teeth and the Eternal Quicksand, slay the Unfathomable Phoenix guarding the treasure, and be back before Huey finishes his challenge. Unless that bird ruins our adventure again. Hey, that bird led us to safety! From what? A bit of electrified rain?! Yes. Out of my way, you pesky poultry! Is that... the Nandi Bear from Finch's "Cave of the Bear Clan"?! Oh- ho- ho! Don't you want to fight a massive and ferocious bear with claws the size of a man? No. But Finch herself fought this beastie and... Oh, no ya don't, you avian agitator! Not this again! What in blazes?! The map! Everyone follow that bird! Ha! Soon- to- be- Senior- Woodchuck summits the insurmountable mount... Of course. OK, Huey. No pressure. Sure, you just abandoned a fellow Woodchuck, but, hey, you're about to win, and that's all that matters, right? Not helping, book! Whoa! What're you doin'? Rule 726: Always check every bridge for stability. I don't have time for rules! Are you coming or not? No. Where you go now, I cannot follow. Fine. I don't need your help. I'm gonna be a Senior Woodchu... - Just go! - Hubert? Hubert?! Junior Woodchuck Rule Number 726: - Check every bridge for... - Yes, I know! OK. OK... uh... When you're between a rock and a hard place... I don't know! I'm gonna throw this rock! She might have more badges, but ol' Huey's put in the time. Huey's gonna be the Senior Woodchuck! Huey has to be the Senior Woodchuck! Vexatious bird! Stupid bird! Oh, I'm so mad I can't even alliterate. Which way did the bird go? Fantastic. We followed that bird brain through an uncharted cave and now we are missing out on the adventure! I'm cold and terrified. Sure feels like an adventure to me. Or maybe it's just a different adventure. Well, it's not the right one! We're supposed to be following in the footsteps of greatness! Following the map! Adventure isn't about following the same old path. It's about discovering new things and going off the map! Poppycock. Who ever told you that? You. But... but it's history. So let's rewrite history. Oh... What do you think, family? Should we follow this crazy bird to some unknown adventure? Yeah! Ouch! You never failed a Woodchuck test before. Be better! Almost there. You're going to be a Senior Woodchuck. Oh, come on! I deduced the most effective use of this rising heat is a hang glider. See you at the finish line! Chump! What do I do?! J.W., I need your help! Well, Huey, the only person who can help you is you. See, the true lesson... What is happening?! I don't know! Why are you imagining this?! Huh? Violet? But you could've... Junior Woodchuck Rule 162: A Junior Woodchuck looks out for their fellow Woodchucks, whatever the cost. You really are a better Woodchuck than me. I broke the rules. I left you behind. I didn't just fail the challenge. I failed my oath. I don't deserve these. I too have failed before. Wait. There's a failure badge? I tried to qualify for Senior Woodchuck three times before I was accepted this year. Yes. Failure is a logical and natural conclusion of trying something new. Junior Woodchuck Rule Number 7: Work harder, make yourself better, and try again. Come. Let us finish together. Perhaps we can both be Senior Woodchucks. No. You earned it. I haven't. Yet. Hm. I thought this would be more climactic. What do we do?! You're the Senior Woodchuck! I respond to authority! Launchpad?! Launchpad?! Hey, I'm Launchpad! You guys are just in time to see the winner! Yes! That's my boy! Actually, I lost. That can't be right. The challenge was rigged! My boy deserves to win! No, Mom. I didn't. And that's OK. Yeah, you lost! 'Cause you're a... Lena. Shh! Launchpad, I will take my Failure Badge, please. Here. Take one of mine. And now, welcome the newest Senior Woodchuck, Violet Apollonia Sabrewing. Yeah! Go Violet! Whoo! We learned an important lesson today: The adventure is not always about the treasure that awaits us at the end, but the journey that... Would you knock it off with the song?! Wait, that song. Is that the Tittertwill Bird of Knowledge?! The whobada bird of what now? The legendary mascot of the Woodchucks! Descended from the personal pet of Isabella Finch herself. It wasn't distracting us. It was guiding us to Finch's treasure! I cannae believe it. The last treasure of Isabella Finch! It was under our noses this whole time! It's more precious than I ever could've imagined. The treasure is a book?! Boo! It's Finch's Lost Adventure Journal! It contains all the adventures she had, advice she left for future generations. She really did have the answer to everything. Or almost everything... The Missing Mysteries? This is a list of legends Finch never found! The Stone of What Was! The Lost Harp of Mervana! The Third Eye Diamond! This could help us find the greatest lost mysteries of all time! Now that is an adventure. What do ya say, family? Yeah! My name is Dewey! The Ducks found the journal. Access to the most mysterious relics lost to time. Then the race is on.
