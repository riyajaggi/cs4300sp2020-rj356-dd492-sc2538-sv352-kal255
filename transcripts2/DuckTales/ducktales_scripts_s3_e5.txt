 We wanted to give you a taste of our... - As yet unpaid for... - Global tour! Now, we know how busy you are. But we also know how devastated you would be if you missed out on the chance to sponsor us! We don't need money... All we need is equipment, a tour bus, a plane with our faces on it... Grrrr. That's ridiculous! Scrooge is far too busy and important to go plane shopping. You're right. We'll take the money instead. Fifty million. Tops.

The fastest way to fame is Emma Glamour's IT List. Ooh! I know everything about the IT List. Whatever Emma Glamour posts on her annual online list becomes instantly popular. How do you think I found my favorite band? And my signature hairstyle. If I'm following the trends right, I think next year's big thing is gonna be sick yo-yo tricks. Ow. I'll get it by the time the IT List comes out. Yeah? Sure, Dew. We just get on this blog! - But how?! - Why will no one tell us?! Okay. Okay, just... Look, Glamour is a famous tastemaker who only emerges once a year to post her IT List at... an exclusive party at the Duckburg Museum. A night of famous people celebrating how great they are. These are my people. We're going?! I get you into that party... We perform for Glamour... We get on the IT List before it's posted online... Then we'll be famous around the planet! Internet fame. The most important fame of all. I don't know. How will we get in? Hmm. This is an exclusive party. If only someone had a super-elaborate scheme to get in... Ka-boom! I give you Louie's Eleven. A multi-part, multi-person plan guaranteed to get us in. The perfect scheme. Ah, cool. Maybe if we... Please don't touch the perfect scheme. But I know all about this party. And I know all about schemes, dear Dewford. All you have to do is listen to me. And sign this legally binding contract giving me half of any money you make after you get famous. What?! We can't... I already signed for you, Donald! Gimme the pen! Ahhhh. All eleven have an important role. I'm the team leader, obviously. Caballeros, you're the talent. And I'm the inside man, because I know this party inside and out. What?! No. But don't worry, I have a very special job just for you. Oh-ho, ho-ho-ho! Special! This party is invite only, so we're gonna need... Ha! And you said calligraphy camp was a waste of time. Mwah! Hubert, it is perfect! Welcome to the scheme. - What scheme? - Nothing. Tell no one! Next we're gonna need a way to communicate all sneaky-like. All right. These earpieces are definitely not experimental. I'm definitely not testing them on you. And they definitely won't explode in your head if you wear them too long. Hmm. Have fun at your party! And lastly, we need o figure out the party layout inside the museum, which we are doing now. Aaah! - Aah! - Wha...! There's Glamour's seat, and there's the stage. Let's go, everyone! We want to start fashionably late, not late late. And remember, nobody gets onstage without a stage pass. - Who's that?! - Guh. Daisy Duck. Glamour's personal assistant. If we want to get to Glamour, we have to go through her. Whatever. Nice placement on the banners, Rosa. Those shrimp puffs could be puffier, Shaun. Are these rhododendrons?! We've gotta get 'em out of here before... she shows up. Are those rhododendrons? Run. I'll handle it. You know I'm allergic to bad taste. Of course, Ms. Glamour. I mean, who would bring rhododendrons to your party? A rhodo-dumb-dumb? - Hmm. - Mn-hmm. You have narrowly avoided ruining this party. For now. Oh, thank you, Ms. Glamour. I promise, everything's going to be... - Perfect. - It already is. I'm gonna dance on the red carpet! No! Stick to the plan! This is Louie's Eleven. As long as there are no surprises, we'll be fine. I swear! I left my invitation in the limo. It's parked right around the side. I'll go get it! Unhh! No party crashers. Wait a minute. Was that... Hmph. Why is Falcon Graves working security here? He's gonna recognize me and know we're not invited to the party! - Maybe he won't remember you. - The last time I saw him I cost him millions of dollars and threw him off a building. [gasps Hey, that does make this harder. New plan. Dewey's not going to the party. Uh, what?! You need me in there. This the Dewey-est party in town! Ohh! Why was I cursed to be so flashy and unforgettable? Hmm. Okay, Dewey. Play it cool. The c-c-coolest, baby. There's something familiar about you. Hey, pal. This is DJ Daft Duck, Duckburg's most electrifying funkatronic DJ, and his entourage, as you can see from our very official invitation. Fun times! Graves, keep the line moving! Welcome to the party, pal. - That's mine. - We did it! No thanks to Dewey showing off. We almost got busted! What?! This whole party is for showing off. I know how it works. No more improvising, no more showboating. Everyone listens to my plan. The plan to wow Glamour with our haunting melodies. You mean our sick dance beats. Hey! Hey! Guys, stop it! Look, Uncle Donald's right. Earpieces in. All right, split up. José, Panchito, head to the stage by the guard. Grrr. Ha ha ha ha! I will charm my way onstage with my golden voice. Unhh! Ohh! What are you going to do, dance your way past her? Easy, grownups. You won't be able to get past the guard without Daisy's stage pass. We've gotta distract Daisy so Uncle Donald can steal it. So I'll dazzle Daisy with my hip and stylish yo-yo tricks. - Wha! Ow! - Oh, that would be great, Dewey, but it's just not part of the plan. Your very important job is coming up. Jane, you're a go. Yes sir, Mr. Duck. Everything is on schedule and under control. Time to party. I'm very excited for you to see my outfit. Ohh! I am so sorry. Aaah! Why, you no-good... Daisy, please. You're embarrassing us both. Mostly yourself, though. I'm so sorry. I-I'll go clean up. Excellent work, Jane. As always. Uncle Donald, get that stage pass. And now that Glamour is unguarded, I'll lay on the Louie charm. Time to get her excited for the Three Caballeros' big perform... Ohhh, phooey! No photographs. Graves is gonna sniff out our plan. - How do we get rid of him? - This is your moment. The job that only you can do. Aaaah! This is my job?! Holding a monster?! Not monster. "Team member." I could be doing more! How is this the perfect job for me? Because everyone else already had a job. Man! Oww! An intruder. Not tonight! Rassafrassin' party! Rassafrassin' IT List! Mmm, gahh! Oh... This is your shot to prove yourself to Ms. Glamour. Take it! Ahh. Remember, you've got to grab the stage pass and get off. Then our tenth member stops the elevator, keeping Daisy on lockdown and out of the way. This party is the coolest! Beautiful night, isn't it? Kind of a terrible night, actually. - What floor? - Oh... uh... whoops! Great. Not like I was in a hurry or anything. Oh, sorry. I'm in your space. - I got it... - All right, he's got it. Webby, cut the elevator power. Unh! - Hey! - Let me just... You're making it worse! Wheee! Oh, no. Oh no, oh no, oh no! - Let us out of here! - I've got to get back to the party! This is all your fault! My fault?! It's, uh, it's your bag! Whoa! Okay! Uncle Donald, meet José and Panchito at the stage with the pass, for your performance. I'm going radio silent. - If I could only... - I'm gonna miss my big break! What do you mean, big break? My band is sort of, uh, crashing the party? I'm back. What do I do now? Network with the rich and famous? Or I could walk the dog, yeah? What do you think? I am going to talk to to Emma Glamour to convince her how great the Caballeros are. You do nothing. Come on! Let me talk to Glamour! We like all the same things because she tells me what to like! Why won't you listen to me? Because your plan is ridiculous! Come on, man, we're so close. Let's just do it my way. Yeah... okay. Man, thought this place was supposed to be cool, but the Three Caballeros aren't even playing. Oh, hi. Louie Duck, Louie's List. It's like your blog, but only younger, cooler, and list-ier. - You know. - What is your plan here, exactly? I'm sorry, what? Oh, let me guess. You have this whole elaborate scheme to get on the IT List and make yourself rich and famous. What do you do, manage a band or something? Happens every year. You're nothing new. You're not original. There is nothing "IT" about you. So tell me, why would I ever listen to you? Disappear now. Goodbye. Well, I've tried everything. Where is Donald with that stage pass? Oye, this is impossible! Can no one get past this guard?! Unhh! I'm using the money for college. I don't want to be at Funso's forever. Why not? Ladies and gentlemen, your attention! This is a robbery. Everybody stay calm. Once my team has secured the museum, we can finally get what we came here for. I had it all planned out. How was I supposed to know Louie's Eleven wasn't the only scheme tonight? Wait, Louie's Eleven. Who's number eleven? That's it! I knew the plan was perfect! The Enforcer. The guy you call in when everything goes bad. I'll show her who's not "IT." Number Eleven, you're our last hope. Ahh! No! That was odd. Now Ms. Glamour, give me your phone. Almost. Almooooost... Oh, just sit still! Oh, this darn stain! Seeping through my coat and onto my dress. Wow! Nice dress! Oh! You like it? I mean, of course you do. I made it myself. I was hoping Glamour would see it and put me on her IT List. Then I could be a real designer. But that's not gonna happen since you got us stuck in here with your band's dumb plan! Not that she ever listens to me anyway. Nobody listens to me, either. They don't understand me! Well, that's weird. I understand you perfectly. Well, we've got time.

Ms. Glamour's gonna hear us both! Whether she wants to or not! What happened while we were in that elevator? - My kids! - Where's Mr. Glamour? Wait. Your kids? Give that back! I need to post a very negative review of your work on my blog! You, sir, are not "IT." I don't take orders from you anymore. I've stolen your precious phone, the key to your whole company, and sold it to the highest bidder. And here he... Oh no! Not again! Not Mark Beaks! Ho ho! Gravesy! Long time no crime! You're the buyer?! Um, a phone that can make me the most buzzworthy person on the internet? - Shyeah, boyyy! - Ohh. Marcus. Ha! Look who's gonna make the IT List now, Mom! Pyew! Pyew-pyew-pyew-pyew! Mom?! Huh. That actually makes a lot of sense. Okay, Lou, you're in charge. What do we do now? I don't know! I thought I had it all planned out, but I have no idea what I'm talking about here! But I Dew-ey! Stop! They'll grab you too! Nope, because I know exactly what these people want. Just listen to me for once. - He-ey! - Hmm? Aha! Oh, my gosh, he's the worst. But... fascinating somehow? I want to look away, but I can't. It's grotesque. But amazing. Good plan, Dewey... is a thing I never thought I'd say. The failure of it all is ridiculous... and beautiful! That is IT. What? No way. Gimme that phone! That's it! I'm going to take you both out and end this infuriating family once and for all!

This party is boring! Can we go? Well, Louie's Eleven wasn't exactly the perfect scheme. Hey, we got into the party and survived a hostage situation. Thanks to you.
