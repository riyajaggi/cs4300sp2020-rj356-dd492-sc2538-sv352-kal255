I'M DEAD. I'LL GO WITH YOU. PARENTS ARE LESS INCLINED TO FLIP OUT IF THERE'S AN EYEWITNESS. YOU HAVE SOME EXPLAINING TO DO, DOUGLAS. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS? MY GOD, IT'S GOT YOUR NAME ON IT. HELLO, ANA. OH, DAVID, SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL. HOLDING THIS BABY MAKES ME THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER ONE. KATHERINE, PLEASE, I AM 54 YEARS OLD. I JUST TALKED TO MRS. POLLACK. I'M GONNA MEET HER AT THE HOSPITAL IN ABOUT AN HOUR. I STILL THINK YOU SHOULD NOTIFY THE POLICE. DAD, SHE'S JUST ASKING FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS TO THINK. SHE'S 17. SHE'S UNMARRIED. HER PARENTS HAVE TURNED THEIR BACKS ON HER. I DON'T WANNA DO THE SAME. DOUGLAS, SHE ABANDONED HER CHILD. THAT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD GO UNREPORTED. DAD, IF I CALL THE POLICE, THEY MAY TAKE THE BABY AWAY FROM HER. HOW WOULD SHE EVER GET OVER THAT? LOOK, LET ME TALK TO MRS. POLLACK. SHE'S A SOCIAL WORKER. SHE HANDLES THIS KIND OF THING ALL THE TIME. IF THERE'S ANY WAY I CAN HELP THIS GIRL, I WANT TO. I THINK SHE'S ENTITLED TO OUR COMPASSION, DAVID. OKAY, DOUGLAS. TRY IT YOUR WAY. DON'T YOU GUYS HAVE A BANQUET TO GO TO? I CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS. YOU DON'T WANNA BE LATE, DO YOU? - ARE YOU SURE? - DAD, I'M A PHYSICIAN, FOR PETE'S SAKE. - KATHERINE? - I THINK IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. GREAT! NOW GO, GO, HAVE A GOOD TIME! - HER DIAPER NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. - WHOA. SURELY YOU CAN HANDLE CHANGING A DIAPER, DR. HOWSER. - OH, HI. - HELLO, WANDA. YOU LOOK VERY... EXTRAVAGANT. WHAT WERE YOU AND DOOGIE PLANNING ON DOING TONIGHT? BOWLING. YEAH, YEAH, BOWLING. ALL RIGHT, LET'S BEGIN. I'M DETACHING THE DIAPER. All: WHOA! OH MY GOD, THIS IS DISGUSTING! SUCH A LITTLE BABY MADE ALL THIS? THIS CANNOT BE NORMAL. IT'S NOT PRETTY, BUT IT'S NORMAL. WHERE'S THE CAN? - GOT IT! - ALL RIGHT, WE'RE HALFWAY THERE. WHO'S GONNA WIPE THE BABY OFF? THE CARD HAD YOUR NAME ON IT, DOOG. TRUE LOVE GOES JUST SO FAR. IS SHE OKAY? YEAH, SHE'S ASLEEP. IT FEELS KIND OF NICE TO HOLD HER. I'M SORRY ABOUT TONIGHT. I MEAN, THAT OUR PLANS GOT CANCELED. IT'S OKAY, I DON'T MIND. - YOU DON'T? - I MEAN, I MIND, - I'M REALLY AGGRAVATED... - OKAY. BUT I UNDERSTAND. I MEAN, WE HAD TO TAKE HER TO THE HOSPITAL. YOU LOOK REALLY BEAUTIFUL. I MEAN, YOU LOOKED EXACTLY RIGHT FOR THE OCCASION. THANK YOU. I-I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO WEAR. - ARE YOU SURE IT WASN'T TOO DRESSY? - NO, IT'S PERFECT. GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE NOT GONNA DO IT. I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED. YEAH, ME TOO. GOD, I LOVE THE SMELL OF UNDERWEAR IN THE MORNING! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? DIVE IN. VINNIE, I CAN'T GET WANDA ANYTHING LIKE THAT. IT'S EMBARRASSING! DOOG, LAST NIGHT WAS A BUST. THE DANGER HERE IS WANDA'S GONNA BACK OUT. YOU GOTTA KEEP THE MOMENTUM GOING WITH A LITTLE BLACK-LACE INSPIRATION. - VINNIE. - YOU WANNA DO IT, DON'T YOU? - OF COURSE. - THEN WORK WITH ME, DOOG. WHOA, YOU BUY THIS AND YOU ALMOST DON'T NEED A WOMAN. CHIC! PARDON ME, MADAM. WOULD YOU MIND HOLDING THIS UP AGAINST YOURSELF JUST SO I CAN GET AN IDEA? I'M BUYING A GIFT FOR MY MOTHER. I THINK MOM WOULD LOOK GOOD IN THAT, DON'T YOU, DOOG? - YEAH, I DO. VERY GOOD. - I'M SURE SHE'LL LIKE IT. THANKS, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL SALESWOMAN. AND NOW, ANA, I'D LIKE TO SING SOMETHING TO YOU THAT MY MAMA USED TO SING TO ME. I USED TO TAKE GREAT COMFORT IN IT. ♪ ANA ANA BOBANA BANANA FANA FOFANA ♪ ♪ FEE FIE MOMANA, ANA. ♪ - LET'S DO DOOGIE! - Nurse: I'M SORRY. VISITORS AREN'T ALOUD IN HERE. NO, NO, IT'S OKAY, NURSE. SHE'S WITH ME. ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR. WHAT'S SHE DOING IN HERE? I CHECKED HER IN FOR DEHYDRATION, BUT THERE'S REALLY NOTHING WRONG WITH HER. I WAS JUST WANTING TO BUY A LITTLE TIME. WELL, IF THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH HER, I WANNA TAKE HER HOME. MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THAT FIRST. I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT IT. I ASKED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF HER. I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D END UP IN HERE. WHOA, WHOA, WAIT A SECOND. YOU SCREWED UP. YOU SCREWED UP IN A BIG WAY. WHY, BECAUSE I NEEDED A COUPLE OF DAYS TO THINK? YOU ABANDONED THE BABY! NOW, I WANNA HELP YOU, BUT I HAVE TO HELP ANA, TOO. AT THE HOSPITAL, IT SEEMED LIKE EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE OKAY. BUT I WAS NEVER ALONE WITH HER. SHE ALWAYS NEEDED SOMETHING. SHE WAS CRYING, OR HUNGRY, OR HAD TO BE CHANGED. I WAS SO TIRED, I NEVER EVEN MADE IT TO SCHOOL. AND MY FRIENDS, THEY WOULD PLAY WITH HER FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, AND THEN THEY ALWAYS HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO DO. I DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE SO LONELY. I'M STILL A KID, DR. HOWSER. YOU CAN'T BE A KID WITH A BABY. I KNOW. I SAW A PROGRAM ON TELEVISION WHERE THIS GIRL, THEY CALLED HER "THE BIRTH MOTHER" GOT TO PICK OUT THE COUPLE WHO ADOPTED HER BABY. AND IT MADE HER FEEL BETTER. SHE KNEW THEY WERE GOOD PEOPLE. THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE WHO CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT. IF YOU'D LIKE, I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE OFFICE AND STAY WITH YOU AWHILE. OKAY. I GUESS THAT WOULD BE THE RIGHT THING. DO YOU WANNA SPEND A MINUTE WITH HER... BY YOURSELF? I BETTER NOT. OKAY. - DID YOU HAVE SOME DIP? - NO. BUT IT WAS NICE OF YOU TO MAKE REFRESHMENTS. DOOGIE, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? - I DON'T KNOW. - OKAY. WAIT A MINUTE. MAYBE WE SHOULD KISS FIRST. I READ A WHOLE CHAPTER ON FOREPLAY. THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING IT. ARE YOU SURE YOUR PARENTS WON'T COME HOME? THEY'RE IN SANTA BARBARA. VINNIE'S NOT GONNA COME JUMPING THROUGH THE WINDOW, IS HE? I LOANED HIM MY VOLVO, GAVE HIM MONEY FOR A MOVIE, AND THREATENED HIM WITH A SEVERE PUMMELING. COULD YOU TURN THEM AROUND? OKAY? I CAN'T DO IT. I WANNA HAVE SEX WITH YOU, WANDA. I THINK YOU'RE REALLY SEXY. I'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF SEXUAL FANTASIES ABOUT YOU, BUT I JUST DON'T THINK I'M READY TO HAVE SEX. DOOGIE, I DON'T... OH GREAT, NOW I'VE HURT YOUR FEELINGS. I DIDN'T WANNA DO THAT. DO YOU WANNA DO IT? JUST WAIT A MINUTE, I'M SURE I CAN WORK SOMETHING OUT. I DON'T THINK I'M READY TO DO IT EITHER. WHY? I JUST WANTED TO GET IT OVER WITH. I'M SO TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT IT AND WORRYING ABOUT IT. I THOUGHT WE SHOULD JUST DO IT AND GET IT OVER WITH, AND THEN WE COULD HAVE FUN AGAIN. ARE WE LIKE NERDS? - YEAH. - YEAH. OH NO. OH NO, I'M A NERD, YOU'RE A NERD. COME HERE, NERD GIRL. COME ON! - NO. - COME HERE. I'M GLAD WE CHANGED OUR MINDS, WANDA. I MEAN, WHAT IF SEX CHANGES EVERYTHING BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE? AND NOT JUST HAVING A BABY. WHAT IF JUST HAVING SEX PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON YOU? IF YOU'RE NOT READY FOR IT, MAYBE IT CAN BREAK YOU UP. SEE... I LIKE THE WAY WE ARE TOGETHER. I... I DON'T WANNA RISK MESSING THAT UP. ME NEITHER. I WONDER IF WE'LL EVER DO IT. I DON'T KNOW, BUT IF WE DO, IT WON'T BE BECAUSE VINNIE AND JANINE WANT US TO. IT'LL BE JUST FOR US. COME HERE, I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING. THIS IS MY PERSONAL JOURNAL. EVERY NIGHT I PUT IN MY MOST PRIVATE THOUGHTS. I'VE NEVER SHOWN IT TO ANYONE. THAT'S FOUR LITTLE WORDS. "DOIT"? I LOVE YOU TOO, DOOGIE HOWSER. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
