THEY'RE NEVER GONNA GIVE YOU ANY OF THAT STUFF, AND THIS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE YOU FAMOUS. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET SHOT. HEY, MAN, WE ALL GOTTA GO SOMEDAY. BESIDES, YOU THINK I'M AFRAID OF DYING? HELL, NO. WHEN YOU'RE A GANGBANGER YOU EXPECT TO DIE. IT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS. YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT. NO? LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. HOW MANY OF YOUR FRIENDS YOU EVER SEEN DIE? NONE. I SEEN FOUR OF MY HOMEBOYS DIE THIS YEAR ALONE. OLDEST ONE WAS 19. SEE WHERE I LIVE, THERE'S SOMEBODY DYING EVERY DAY. BUT HEY, MAN, THAT'S LIFE ON THE STREET. MYSELF? I'LL BE SURPRISED IF I SEE THE AGE OF 21. Lucas: OUR LAST COMMUNICATION WAS OVER AN HOUR AGO. WE'VE BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE CONTACT SINCE THEN. LOOK, I KNOW THIS KID. HE'S NOT STUPID. HE DOESN'T WANT TO HURT YOUR SON. Officer: DR. AND MRS. HOWSER, I KNOW HOW YOU'RE FEELING, BUT THE LONGER THIS GOES THE BETTER OUR CHANCES OF ENDING THIS THING WITHOUT INCIDENT. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY DEMANDS? YES, BUT WE'VE CHOSEN NOT TO GIVE IN TO THEM AT THIS TIME. MY GOD, WHY NOT? MY SON AND HIS FRIEND ARE IN THERE. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? PLEASE, MRS. HOWSER, YOU'VE GOT TO TRUST US. - WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. - THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH! HOW CAN YOU LET THIS HAPPEN? WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SAFE HERE. IF HE HURTS MY SON... KATHERINE... - NO! - KATHERINE! THE LAST INCIDENT OF THIS TYPE IN AN AFFLUENT WESTSIDE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS THE GANG-RELATED SHOOTING IN WESTWOOD IN NOVEMBER OF '88. Again, the standoff here in a West Los Angeles convenience store heads into its third hour. At this time police are still withholding the names of both the gunman and his hostages... WHAT? WITHHOLDING OUR NAMES? I DON'T BELIEVE THIS! THEY'RE MESSING WITH MY AIRTIME! THEY CAN'T GET AWAY WITH THIS. PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. I'M CALLING THE STATION. LOOK, Z-MAN, YOU GOTTA FACE THE FACTS. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE IN TO YOUR DEMANDS. THE BEST THING FOR YOU TO DO RIGHT NOW IS TO WALK OUT OF HERE. YOU'RE STILL YOUNG. THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO CHARGE YOU AS A JUVENILE. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND NOTHING, MAN. UNLESS YOU HAVE PRIOR CONVICTIONS... WHAT ARE YOU, A LAWYER? ACTUALLY, I'M A DOCTOR. WHO DO YOU THINK I AM, MAN, SOME KIND OF CHUMP? NO IT'S TRUE. I AM A DOCTOR. I GRADUATED FROM MEDICAL SCHOOL WHEN I WAS 14. - THAT'S D-E-L-P... - HERE. NOT T, P! AS IN PACINO. I-N-O, DELPINO. WELL, WELL, WELL. WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO COME UP WITH NEXT? BLACK MAN CAN'T EVEN GET A JOB MOST PLACES, NOW THEY MAKING RICH WHITE BOYS DOCTORS SOON AS THEY LEARN HOW TO DRIVE! HEY, THEY DIDN'T MAKE ME A DOCTOR. I WORKED HARD FOR THAT. - NOBODY GAVE ME ANYTHING. - MAN, OPEN YOUR EYES! YOU LIVE IN A HOUSE THAT DON'T NEED BARS ON THE WINDOWS. YOU GOT FOOD ON THE TABLE EVERY NIGHT! YOU LIVE ON A STREET WHERE THERE AIN'T A DRUG DEAL ON EVERY CORNER. YOU GOT PLENTY, "DOC." THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO LIVE WITH EVERY DAY. NOT MUCH CHANCE OF ME BECOMING A DOCTOR ANYTIME SOON. WHY NOT? YOU GO TO SCHOOL. YOU CAN WORK HARD, GO TO COLLEGE. YEAH RIGHT. I JOINED THE REAPERS WHEN I WAS 11, JUST SO I COULD GET TO SCHOOL WITHOUT GETTING BEAT UP. WHEN I GET THERE, TEACHER'S TOO BUSY BEING SCARED TO TEACH. WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR ME GOING TO COLLEGE, YOUR OLD MAN? THERE ARE REGULAR JOBS. PEOPLE HAVE THEM, YOU KNOW. YEAH, WELL THEY AIN'T ME. LOOK, COZ, DON'T THINK YOU KNOW ME OR HOW I GOTTA LIVE, BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW ME AT ALL! YOU THINK WE'RE ALL THE SAME. WE WALK DOWN YOUR STREET, YOU'RE MOVING TO THE OTHER SIDE, CHECKING YOUR WALLET. POLICE PULLING US OVER, NO OTHER REASON THAN 'CAUSE WE BLACK. I WATCH TV, I SEE ALL KINDS OF WHITE PEOPLE... BUSINESSMEN, LAWYERS... DOCTORS! ONLY TIME YOU SEE ME IS ON THE 6:00 NEWS BEING DRAGGED OFF TO JAIL! SEE, I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. YOU'RE SCARED TO DEATH OF ME. WHY SHOULDN'T I BE? YOU COME IN HERE HIDING BEHIND A PAIR OF SHADES, WAVING A GUN IN OUR FACES, HOW THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO FEEL? THERE. I LET YOU SEE ME NOW. - VIN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, DOOG. Doogie: HEY, BE CAREFUL WITH THAT THING! LOOK, Z-MAN, WE'RE LEAVING NOW, OKAY? IS THAT RIGHT? HOW YOU GONNA DO THAT? JUST DON'T... DON'T COME NEAR ME. VIN, THIS IS CRAZY. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, MAN, SHOOT ME? HERE I AM. The standoff here in Brentwood - continues into its fifth hour with little change. Unconfirmed sources have told us the suspect's name is Raymond Alexander, age 16, from Compton. His hostages are two Brentwood teenagers, Douglas Howser and Vincent Del Florio. DEL FLORIO? DEL FLORIO? I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS! - I EVEN SPELLED IT FOR THEM! - RELAX, VINNIE. OH SURE, RELAX. EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. THEY DIDN'T GET YOUR NAME WRONG. THEY DIDN'T GET HIS NAME WRONG. IT'S ALWAYS ME! IT'S LIKE THEY GOT A THING AGAINST SHORT ITALIAN GUYS! IS HE ALWAYS LIKE THIS? YEAH, PRETTY MUCH. YOU MAY BE CRAZIER THAN ME, MAN. YEAH? Vinnie: THAT'LL BE A BUCK 49. KEEP THE CHANGE.
