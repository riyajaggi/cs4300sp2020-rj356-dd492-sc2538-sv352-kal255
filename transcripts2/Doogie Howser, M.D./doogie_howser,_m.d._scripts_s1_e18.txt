I'M SURE YOU'LL GET MANY HOURS OF SPRING PLEASURE TOO. BY THE WAY, HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU YOU'RE A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, MRS. HOWSER? Howser: SO, HOW IS THE SHOWERHEAD BUSINESS? EH, JUST LIKE THE FUNERAL BUSINESS: PEOPLE GOTTA DIE, PEOPLE GOTTA BATHE. THOSE THAT DON'T BELIEVE THAT, YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW. RIGHT. THE DELPINO X9000, IT EMITS THE PERFECT STREAM, NOT TOO SOFT, NOT TOO HARD. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THE DANGERS OF TOO HARD A SPRAY. BEING A DOCTOR, I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN PERSONAL INJURIES OF THAT ECHELON. NO, NO, I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE. NOW, I'M LOOKING AT YOU AND I'M SEEING A CONSERVATIONIST. THIS IS A TURBO-SAVER HEAD WITH A 2 1/2 GALLON-PER-MINUTE WATER FLOW. THIS SHOWER WILL PAY FOR ITSELF IN HOT WATER SAVINGS IN THE FIRST YEAR. SOUNDS EXCITING... AND FRUGAL. HERE'S A FINGERTIP CONTROL THAT OFFERS A FULL PULSATING ROTARY... - ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? - HMM, MM. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAW A PHYSICIAN? I'M GOING TO DR. MELBOURNE. HE'S GIVING ME SOME PILLS. IT'S NOTHING REALLY. I'LL BE OKAY. WHEW! ANYWAY, THIS BABY HAS A 10-SPEED SHOWER MASSAGE. MY PERSONAL FAVORITE IS NUMBER SIX. DO YOU AND THE MISSUS LIKE TO CLEANSE TOGETHER? - WELL... - I RECOMMEND IT. IT'S VERY THERAPEUTIC. I RECEIVED SOME FAVORABLE MAIL TO THAT EFFECT. NOW BELIEVE ME, IF EVERYBODY HAD ONE OF THESE, THE DIVORCE RATE WOULD BE A LOT LOWER. WHAT AM I GONNA DO, DOOG? I MEAN, I WANNA GO TO COLLEGE. I WANNA BE A FILMMAKER! THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT, MR. HOLLYWOOD. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. IT'S THE SCRIPT FOR OUR COMMERCIAL. TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK. I DON'T KNOW. HEY, IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE UP THE BATON, YOU'LL HAVE TO BE PART OF EVERYTHING. DAD, YOU KNOW, I WANNA GO TO COLLEGE. FORGET THAT. WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE LIKE DOOGIE HERE? HE HAS THE RESPECT TO GO INTO HIS FATHER'S BUSINESS. ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT EXACTLY MY FATHER'S BUSINESS. YOU'RE A DOCTOR, HE'S A DOCTOR. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. COME ON, VINCENT. WE GOTTA REHEARSE THIS THING. - DAD, I DON'T WANNA. - YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS, VINCENT! - YOU CAN'T MAKE ME. - VINCENT?! AH... I'M... THROUGH KNOCKING HEADS WITH YOU ABOUT THIS. - YOU'LL GO INTO THE BUSINESS, YOU'LL LOVE IT. - I WON'T! YES, YOU WILL! YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT AND LIKE IT. - NO WAY! - VINCENT! I MEAN, THIS ISN'T THE OLD COUNTRY WHERE A COBBLER IS THE SON OF A COBBLER OR A BLACKSMITH'S THE SON OF A BLACKSMITH. YOU'D THINK THAT MR. DELPINO WOULD BE PROUD THAT HE BUILT UP A BUSINESS WHERE HE HAS ENOUGH MONEY TO SEND HIS SON TO COLLEGE. SOME FAMILIES ARE JUST MORE STEEPED IN TRADITION THAN OTHERS. YEAH, WELL, IF YOU ASK ME, THE DELPINOS ARE WAY TOO STEEPED. I THINK IN THIS CASE THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN JUST FAMILY TRADITION. LIKE WHAT? I CALLED FRANK MELBOURNE. HE'S CARMINE DELPINO'S CARDIOLOGIST. IT SEEMS THAT CARMINE HAS A SIGNIFICANT CORONARY INSUFFICIENCY. - WHOA. - ANGINA. HE'S HAD AN ANGIOGRAM WHICH SHOWS MULTIPLE-VESSEL STENOSIS, AND MELBOURNE IS RECOMMENDING BYPASS SURGERY. THAT EXPLAINS A LOT OT THINGS. HMM. I WONDER WHY VINNIE DIDN'T TELL ME. MY GUESS IS THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IN THE FAMILY KNOWS. DAD, YOU GOTTA TALK TO MR. DELPINO. UH, CARMINE DELPINO. - THROUGH THAT DOOR. - OH... - Man on P.A.: Shipping to the service counter. - THANK YOU. Man #2: BRING THAT OVER HERE, WILL YOU, ART? HI, DR. H! I JUST BUY IT FOR THE ARTICLES. SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I HOPE THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH THE DELPINO X9000. NO, NO, IT'S... IT'S JUST FINE. PERFECT. IT'S A GREAT PIECE OF HARDWARE. - HOW'S THE MISSUS LIKE IT? - FINE. ACTUALLY, MR. DELPINO, I'VE COME HERE AS A FRIEND AND A NEIGHBOR. UH, IT'S PROBABLY NONE OF MY BUSINESS, AND I'M NOT YOUR DOCTOR BUT... YOU HAVE A SERIOUS HEART PROBLEM THAT NEEDS ATTENTION. - YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO MELBOURNE. - HMM. YOU'RE A WALKING TIME BOMB. YOU NEED SURGERY RIGHT AWAY. YOU GUYS... ALL THE TIME "CUT, CUT, CUT." IF YOU DON'T HAVE BYPASS SURGERY, YOU COULD DIE. HEY, I COULD DIE ON THE OPERATING TABLE JUST AS EASY, AND THEN WHAT? WHO'S GONNA RUN THIS PLACE? HUH-UH, I AM NOT GOING UNDER THE KNIFE UNTIL MY SON LEARNS THIS BUSINESS. VINNIE IS 16 YEARS OLD. HE'S A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. - COME HERE A MINUTE. - Philly, pick up line 2. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PLACE! MY DAD DIED AT 53. I TOOK OVER HIS BUSINESS AND TURNED IT INTO THIS. AND I NEVER FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL. YOU KNOW, TIMES HAVE CHANGED. KIDS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY FOLLOW IN THEIR FATHERS' FOOTSTEPS. KIDS DO WHAT THEIR FATHERS TELL THEM TO DO. YOU MADE YOUR BOY INTO A DOCTOR, DIDN'T YOU? - I DIDN'T FORCE HIM. - LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION, DAVID. - CAN I CALL YOU DAVID? - SURE. OKAY, DAVE, WHAT DO YOU NET? I'M TALKING TAKE HOME IN YOUR BACK POCKET, JANUARY 1. WELL, I DON'T... MAYBE YOU'RE TOO EMBARRASSED TO SAY IT OUT LOUD, BUT I AIN'T. I'M PROUD OF IT. 210 BIG ONES LAST YEAR, NET NET. THAT'S AFTER TAXES. IS THIS THE AMERICAN DREAM OR WHAT? THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DOING BETTER THAN OUR FATHERS DID SO OUR SONS CAN DO BETTER THAN US. ABSOLUTELY! THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M TRYING TO TEACH THE LITTLE SNOT, BUT INSTEAD HE WANTS TO BECOME SOME TWINKLE-TOES FILMMAKER. LISTEN, CARMINE, I HAVE GOT TO GO. LET'S GET YOUR BUTT INTO EASTMAN MEDICAL SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THIS SAME ARGUMENT FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS. I'LL THINK ABOUT IT, DAVE. DON'T THINK TOO LONG. HERE! TAKE THIS NEW EXTENSION HOSE FOR THE DELPINO X9000, FREE OF CHARGE. IT'S FOR THOSE HARD-TO-REACH SPOTS. Director: ACTION. HELLO, I'M CARMINE DELPINO FOR DELPINO SHOWERHEADS, THE FINEST NAME IN QUALITY SPRAYWARE. YOU KNOW, THERE IS ONE CREATURE THAT GOD PUT ON THIS EARTH WHO ENJOYS AND SAVORS THEIR SHOWER MORE THAN ANY OTHER, AND THAT CREATURE IS THE DUCK. NOW THESE ARE THE TWO BEST SHOWERHEADS IN THE BUSINESS: THE CORONA 850 AND THE DELPINO X9000. LET'S SEE WHICH PASSES THE DUCK TEST. FIRST, THE CORONA. A NEGATIVE FEATHERY STATEMENT IF EVER I SAW ONE. NOW LET'S TRY THE DELPINO X9000. JUST LIKE A GENTLE SPRING RAIN. YOU CAN'T SEE IT AT HOME, BUT THIS LITTLE GUY IS ACTUALLY SMILING. SO GO TO YOUR FAVORITE BATHROOM FIXTURE STORE AND TELL THE DEALER YOU WANT TO PURCHASE THE DELPINO X9000. AND LIKE THE DUCK HERE SAYS, "JUST PUT IT ON MY BILL." Director: AND CUT. THAT'S A TAKE. - SO? - YEAH, THAT WAS GREAT, MR. DELPINO. NEXT ONE WITH YOU AND ME IS GONNA BE EVEN BETTER. DAD, I JUST CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS. NOT AGAIN. YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA DO IT, YOU'RE GONNA DO IT! BUT MY HEART ISN'T IN IT. IT'LL LOOK FAKE! DO YOU HEAR THIS? HE'S KILLING ME! VINCENT, I'M ORDERING YOU. PICK UP THAT SCRIPT, - LEARN THOSE LINES NOW! - MR. DELPINO, TAKE IT EASY. I'M NOT DOING THIS STUPID COMMERCIAL. IT STINKS! IT'S EMBARRASSING! I COULD DO A BETTER ONE THAN THIS IN MY SLEEP! - COME ON, VINNIE. - DON'T YOU GIVE ME ANY LIP, YOUNG MAN! I'VE BEEN MAKING THESE HERE COMMERCIALS FOR YEARS. NOW YOU HEARD ME! PICK UP THAT SCRIPT! I'M WARNING... DAD, DAD, DAD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?! DAD! STAY CALM, STAY CALM. OKAY, OKAY, DON'T TALK. I'M GONNA UNDO YOUR SHIRT. OKAY, TAKE DEEP BREATHS, SLOW, SLOW AND EASY. - Woman: Can we help? - GET THE PARAMEDICS, HURRY! Man: GARY, CALL SECURITY. Doogie: YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY. WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME ABOUT THIS? DO YOU THINK I'D BE YELLING AT HIM? GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE I ALMOST KILLED MY POP! VINNIE, YOU DIDN'T. HE KNEW HE HAD A PROBLEM AND HE DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF IT. DOOG, YOU GIVE IT TO ME STRAIGHT. IS HE GONNA DIE? THE MORTALITY RATE'S VERY LOW. IF THERE ARE NO COMPLICATIONS, THEY SHOULD HAVE HIM UP ON HIS FEET IN 24 HOURS. BUT THERE COULD BE COMPLICATIONS? WELL, SURE, I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU IT'S RISK-FREE. - WHAT IF HE DIES? - HE WON'T. I JUST CAN'T STAND THE IDEA OF HIM GOING UNDER THE KNIFE TOMORROW MORNING THINKING HIS ONLY SON HATES HIM. HE DOESN'T THINK THAT. YOU HEARD HIM, DOOG, HE SAID I'M KILLING HIM. LOOK, YOUR DAD WILL PROBABLY SAIL THROUGH THIS BYPASS. FOR BOTH YOUR SAKES, WHY DON'T YOU GO TALK TO HIM BEFORE THE OPERATION? YOU KNOW, MAKE YOUR PEACE WITH HIM. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. THIS IS GOOD ADVICE. SO, SO YOU REALLY THINK IT'S NOT THAT BIG A DEAL, HUH? IT'S BIG, BUT IT'S NOT THAT BIG. SO-SO WHAT ARE THEY ACTUALLY GONNA DO? WELL, THEY TAKE KIND OF LIKE A SAW, AND THEY CUT RIGHT THROUGH THE STERNUM... THAT'S THE BREASTBONE... THEN THEY SPREAD APART THE RIBS, EXPOSING THE HEART... POP? POP, YOU IN HERE? ALL RIGHT, IT'S GOOD YOU'RE IN THERE AND I'M OUT HERE, 'CAUSE I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME AND I DON'T WANT YOU INTERRUPTING ME LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO. SO-SO STAY IN THERE TILL I SAY WHAT I GOTTA SAY. UH... I KNOW YOU'VE NEVER UNDERSTOOD ME, AND I KNOW WE GOT A REAL TOUGH TIME COMMUNICATIN', AND WE FACE OFF A LOT ABOUT... WELL, JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. I ALSO KNOW YOU NEVER LOVED ME AS MUCH AS YOU LOVED MY SISTER. I'LL NEVER LIVE UP TO HER, BUT I NEED YOU TO PULL THROUGH THIS THING 'CAUSE NOTHING I DO IS GONNA MEAN A THING UNLESS YOU'RE THERE WITH ME. I GUESS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS... BOTTOM LINE, DAD... IF YOU REALLY WANT ME IN THE BUSINESS, THEN... THEN THAT'S IT, I'M IN THE BUSINESS. I LOVE YOU, POP! YOU'RE A FINE BOY. EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE A SON LIKE YOU. - WHERE'S MY FATHER? - DOWNSTAIRS HAVING SOME TESTS. OH. MA, POP'S A HANG-TOUGH GUY, A SURVIVOR. HE'S GONNA BE OKAY. I KNOW, I KNOW. IT'S JUST HE'S NEVER HAD A SICK DAY IN HIS LIFE. HOW ARE YOU DOIN', VINNIE? UH, OKAY, BUT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH MY DAD? IT'S BEEN THREE HOURS. RELAX, I'VE SEEN LOTS OF THESE OPERATIONS. IT SHOULDN'T BE MORE THAN ANOTHER HOUR OR SO. Maintenance, second floor nurse's station... SO, IS THIS HANDSOME YOUNG SINGLE MAN A DOCTOR? UH, MA, THIS IS DR. JACK McGUIRE. HE'S A FRIEND OF DOOGIE'S. MY DAUGHTER, 19 1/2, SINGLE, FLYING BACK THIS AFTERNOON FROM NEW JERSEY. - SHE'S... VERY NICE. - AND COOKS! I TAUGHT HER EVERYTHING I KNOW. OH MY... I WANT YOU TO SAMPLE A CENTURIES-OLD RECIPE, PASSED ON FROM MOTHER TO DAUGHTER. HMM, HERE, EAT. DON'T BE ASHAMED. I... I WILL. THANKS, MRS. DELPINO. NICE BOY! TALL TOO! COULD USE A HAIRCUT. Ms. Ann Lloyd to pediatrics. Ms. Ann Lloyd to pediatrics. Dr. Sing to O.R. HI, I JUST CHECKED IN. IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING'S GOING SMOOTHLY. NO PROBLEMS, NO SURPRISES. HE SHOULD BE IN INTENSIVE CARE IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES. DOOGIE, THANK YOU. YOUR FATHER MUST BE VERY PROUD OF YOU. TALK SOME SENSE INTO THIS BOY, WILL YOU? - COME ON, MA. - I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. I'M GONNA GO CALL YOUR GRANDMOTHER. - HOW ARE YOU HOLDING UP? - OKAY. NOT REALLY. I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM, DOOG. NO DELPINO MAN HAS LIVED PAST THE AGE OF 60. NONE OF THEM HAD THE BENEFIT OF A SURGERY LIKE THIS. THEY'LL GET HIM INTO CARDIAC REHAB. HE'LL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF LIVING A LONG TIME. COOL. I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO BE LIKE BEFORE, THE ARGUING AND ALL. HEY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE. YEAH. ALL I GOTTA DO IS TAKE OVER THE BUSINESS. Hi, I'm Vincent Delpino speaking for Delpino Showerheads, the finest name in sprayware. My father, Carmine Delpino, has served this community for over 10 years. We have the widest selection of nozzles in Southern California and the Delpino name means quality. I'M SO MOVED BY THIS. VINCENT, THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL! Hey, I know what you're saying, "He's the son of the owner, he has to believe in Delpino Showerheads." Well, let's see what you the public think about Delpino Showerheads. When Martha and I got divorced, she got the kids, the house... everything! But I got the Delpino. I have a Delpino in all 14 of my bathrooms, even the bathroom in the limousine. Man: Ow! You lousy... When I'm doin' bad, the manager comes out to the mound, pats my butt and says, "Kid, hit the Delpino." You know, I've never taken a shower, but if I did, I'd use a Delpino. See? You don't have to be a Delpino to appreciate one. Delpino Showerheads, the finest name in sprayware. NOT AS GOOD AS MY DUCKS, BUT A CLOSE SECOND. - I'M VERY TOUCHED. - GOOD. YOU, UH... YOU FEELIN' ALL RIGHT? YEAH, FINE. I WAS PRETTY SCARED. ME TOO. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS LAYING THERE ON THE FLOOR ON MY BACK... I WAS AFRAID TO CLOSE MY EYES BECAUSE I WASN'T SURE THEY WOULD OPEN AGAIN. I'M GLAD THEY STAYED OPEN, BELIEVE ME. AND WHEN I LOOKED UP AND SAW YOU, WHILE I WAS TRYING TO CATCH MY BREATH THROUGH THE PAIN, THERE YOU WERE, 16 YEARS OLD, AND I SAID, "HEY, IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO WHEN I WAS YOU." I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. SUDDENLY I'M 51, AND THIS IS IT? YOU'RE THE TOUGHEST GUY I KNOW. YOU'RE GONNA LIVE TO SEE 10 GRANDCHILDREN AT LEAST. I DIDN'T THINK I WAS SO TOUGH WHEN IT WAS HURTING SO BAD. "ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONGER," FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE. WHO THE HELL IS FRED NIETZSCHE? JUST A GUY. I LEARNED ABOUT HIM IN SCHOOL. SCHOOL, HUH? YEAH, SCHOOL. YOU GOTTA GO TO SCHOOL TO LEARN THIS FILMMAKING STUFF. - UH-HUH. - FILMMAKING. FILMMAKING. YOUR FIRST FILM BETTER NET MORE THAN MY SHOWERHEADS, LITTLE MISTER. - YOU MEAN I CAN? - YEAH. WHO NEEDS YOU ANYWAY NOW THAT I GOT SOME NEW WALL FRAMES FOR MY HEART? THANKS, DAD! VINCENT? I'M DR. CANFIELD, MR. DELPINO. - YOU'RE THE GUY THAT RUNS THIS PLACE. - YES. YOU INSISTED ON SEEING ME? IT'S THESE SHOWERS, THEY STINK. I BEG YOUR PARDON? THE HEADS ARE 1973 SINGLE-SPRAY NOZZLES. STEP INTO THE '90s. BROWSE THROUGH THAT BABY. CHOOSE ONE, AND I'LL OUTFIT THE ENTIRE JOINT. AND SINCE YOU TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF MY TICKER, YOU COULD HAVE 'EM AT WHOLESALE. EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE. TIME FOR YOUR SPONGE BATH, MR. DELPINO. - CALL ME CARMINE. - DAD, YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY MAN. OpenSubtitles recommends to be fit Reshape Weight Loss App: osdb.link/fit
