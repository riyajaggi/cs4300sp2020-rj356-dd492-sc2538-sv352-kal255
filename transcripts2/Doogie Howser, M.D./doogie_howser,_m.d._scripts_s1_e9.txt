 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? - TELL YOU WHAT? - THAT YOUR COUSIN IS A PLANET. SHE'S NOT THAT BIG. SHE'S JUST BIG-BONED. OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT I DIDN'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T SEEN HER SINCE WE WERE 10 YEARS OLD. WHEN WE STARTED OUT THIS EVENING, VINNY OWED ME A FAVOR. NOW I OWE HIM FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. HE LOOKS HAPPY. HE'S HAPPY BECAUSE HE KNOWS I OWE HIM FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. SO HOW ABOUT ANOTHER GAME? - YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. - WHAT? YOU HUNG OUT WITH ME FOR AN HOUR. YOU DID YOUR PART. WANDA WILL BE HAPPY. WE CAN ALL GO HOME. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I NEVER HAD A DATE THAT LASTED LONGER THAN AN HOUR. HA. CONSIDER YOURSELF LUCKY. SOME OF MY DATES END AFTER "HI, I'M VINNY DELPINO. I'M HERE TO PICK YOU UP." COME ON. LET'S RACK THEM UP. I'M HAVING A GOOD TIME. NOW HOW COME YOU MOVED TO L.A. FROM MIAMI? MY FATHER CHANGED JOBS. I'VE NEVER BEEN TO FLORIDA, BUT I'VE SEEN PICTURES OF THE BEACHES. THEY LOOK REALLY NICE. I WOULDN'T KNOW. THE LAST TIME I SHOWED UP AT THE BEACH THEY DECLARED ME AN ENDANGERED SPECIES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU SAY STUFF LIKE THAT. LAUGH! IT'S A JOKE. THANKS A LOT. WHOA. MAJOR WIDE BODY. HOW MANY TOILET SEATS HAVE YOU BROKEN, TOOTS? I HEARD THAT. VERY FUNNY, MALLET HEAD. - VINNY, IT'S OKAY. - NO, IT'S NOT OKAY. YOU'RE MY DATE. SHE'S YOUR DATE? YOU LOOK MORE LIKE HER DINNER. BYE. LOOK, BUDDY, LEAVE HIM ALONE. HE'S JUST A LITTLE GUY. BACK OFF, OR I'LL RIP YOUR HEAD OFF FIRST. COME ON. HOW'S HE GOING TO HURT YOU? WELL, THERE'S YOUR ANSWER. MUST BE TOUGH ON WANDA DATING A DOCTOR. OH YEAH. HIS BEEPER GOES OFF LIKE THAT ALL THE TIME. RUINS A LOT OF GOOD TIMES. WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT? YOU NAILED THAT GUY PRETTY GOOD. I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY'S EYES ROLL THAT FAR BACK INTO THEIR HEAD. I THINK THE FOUR OF US SET A NEW LAND-SPEED RECORD GETTING OUT OF THERE. WE WERE LUCKY HE DIDN'T COME AFTER US. IT'S HARD TO CHASE SOMEONE WHEN YOUR ZIPPER'S BEEN DISLOCATED. ANYWAY, THANKS A LOT. IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING, DEFENDING ME LIKE THAT. HEY, GO ON. IT WAS NOTHING. NOT TO ME. NOBODY'S EVER DONE THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I GUESS I WAS OVERCOME BY CHIVALRY. HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THIS IS ON ME. CHIVALRY'S EXPENSIVE. LOOK, I... HOPE I CAN SEE YOU AGAIN. UH, SURE. WHEN? I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. I HAVE TO CHECK MY SCHEDULE. - IF YOU DON'T WANT TO... - NO. I WANT TO. I MEAN, IT'S OKAY. MOST GUYS DON'T. - I'M USED TO IT. - HEY. IT'S NOT OKAY, OKAY? JUST BECAUSE MOST GUYS ARE CUE-BALLS DOESN'T MEAN I AM. SO HOW ABOUT, LIKE, TOMORROW NIGHT? I'LL HAVE TO CHECK MY SCHEDULE. - OKAY. - OKAY. Man: THERE'S NEW SPLINT MATERIAL I'D LIKE TO TRY NEXT TIME. I LIKE TO USE PLASTER ON THE TOP OF THE NOSE. - IT SEEMS TO HOLD BETTER. - THE DIFFERENCE IS IMPRESSIVE, - LIKE A NEW PERSON. - THAT'S THE REWARD, DR. HOWSER, SEEING THE LOOK ON THEIR FACE WHEN YOU TAKE THE BANDAGES OFF. AND, McGUIRE, MAKE SURE THE PACKING'S OFF BEFORE HE GOES HOME. YES, DOCTOR. THE NEXT PATIENT IS RUTH FABRE. LOOKS LIKE SHE'S HAD A NUMBER OF PRIOR SURGERIES. YES, BREAST AUGMENTATION, MALAR IMPLANTS, RHINOPLASTY, ABDOMINOPLASTY, MENTOPLASTY, FACE LIFTS. - WHAT'S SHE IN FOR NOW? - LIPOSUCTION. WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE HER SADDLEBAGS. HI, DOCTOR. RUTH, THIS IS DR. HOWSER, DR. McGUIRE AND DR. KLEIN. DO YOU MIND LIFTING YOUR GOWN? I'M A DOCTOR. SCOUT'S HONOR. THIS IS THE AREA WHERE SHE HAS SOME EXCESS SUBCUTANEOUS FAT. SOME? I'VE GOT GOBS OF IT. WE'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF SMALL INCISIONS RIGHT... THE SCARS WON'T BE BELOW MY PANTY LINE? THEY'LL BE RIGHT IN THE CREASE SO YOU WON'T SEE THEM. HALF-INCH INCISIONS HERE AND HERE. THIS IS WHERE THE CANNULA GOES. I CAN THIN IT OUT AND CONTOUR THE HIP. YOU CAN LOWER YOUR GOWN NOW. IS HER LAB WORK BACK YET? YES, EVERYTHING'S ON THE CHART. IT WAS ALL NORMAL. YOU'LL GET YOUR SEDATIVE IN A HALF AN HOUR AND THEN I'LL SEE YOU IN SURGERY. THANK YOU, DOCTOR. DOCTORS. SO, DR. HOWSER, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN RECOGNIZE A FAT EMBOLISM NOW? ABSOLUTELY. NO PROBLEM THERE. OF COURSE, IF SHE DEVELOPS A SEROMA WHERE WE SUCTION, IT CAN EASILY BE DRAWN OFF LATER. THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU STOP SUCTION WHEN MORE BLOOD IS COMING OUT THAN FAT. DR. MICHAELS, NO DISRESPECT INTENDED, BUT I QUESTION THE WISDOM OF ALL THESE PROCEDURES. I MEAN, I LOOKED AT HER BEFORE SHOTS ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE IN THAT FILE. WHY IS SHE DOING THIS? IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO RUTH FABRE TO LOOK AS GOOD AS SHE POSSIBLY CAN. SHE ALREADY LOOKED GOOD. SOME PEOPLE'S STANDARDS ARE MORE STRINGENT THAN OTHERS. BESIDES, EVERYBODY WANTS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR APPEARANCE. WHY SHOULDN'T THEY? THEY'RE LUCKY WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO HELP THEM. - HI, CURLY. - HI, DOOGIE. - HI, DR. MICHAELS. - HI. OOH, APPLE? PEACH. WANT IT? NAH. I'VE GOT TO LOSE THREE LBS. OH, GO AHEAD, SPAULDING. YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE. EAT IT NOW. YOU CAN ALWAYS GET IT SUCKED OUT LATER. OH, LOOK. YOU'RE BACK JUST IN TIME. HE'S GONNA PULL OFF THAT SCARF. WAIT TILL YOU SEE HIS FLY HEAD. WHOA! LOOK AT THAT NOGGIN. THAT'S ABOUT A 28 HAT SIZE. YOU MEAN YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO WATCH THE MOVIE? SURE. OF COURSE. THIS IS "THE FLY." THE ORIGINAL. A CLASSIC IN HORROR HISTORY. THIS IS A DRIVE-IN. YOU BRING SOMEONE TO A DRIVE-IN TO LOOK AT THAT. WELL, THE NACHOS LOOK REALLY GOOD. WANT SOME? NOT RIGHT NOW. I CAN RUN AND GET SOME POPCORN. YOU COULD JUST RELAX. NOT WHEN THE FLY IS HAVING LUNCH. FORGET THAT. HEY, HEY, HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON? YOU'RE CRAMPING MY LUNGS. I CAN'T BREATHE. OH, RIGHT. MAKE A FAT JOKE. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I JUST LIKE TO EASE INTO THESE THINGS. - OH SURE. - HEY, I'M ITALIAN. I'M NOT USED TO AGGRESSIVE WOMEN. AGGRESSIVE? IS THAT WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT NOW? YVETTE, WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. - NO, I DON'T. - YOU DIDN'T WANT TO HURT MY FEELINGS, SO YOU TOOK ME TO A DRIVE-IN MOVIE WHERE NOBODY WOULD SEE YOU WITH ME. - THAT'S NUTS. - OH YEAH? HEY, LOOK, EVERYBODY! VINNY'S WITH A BLIMP! CUT THAT OUT. I CAME HERE BECAUSE THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE SHOWING "THE FLY." I THOUGHT YOU WERE DIFFERENT. BUT YOU'RE NOT. YOU'RE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE. I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE. I DON'T NEED ANYMORE OF THIS. YVETTE! HEY, YVETTE! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? Dr. Michaels: LOOKS GREAT. HARDLY ANY DISCOLORATION. WHAT ABOUT MY RIGHT THIGH? THERE WAS A LUMP THERE. RUTH, THE SWELLING HASN'T EVEN GONE DOWN. I PAID $3,000 FOR PERFECT THIGHS, NOT ONE PERFECT THIGH AND ONE LUMPY ONE! GIVE IT SOME TIME. IF IT'S STILL THERE, WE'LL SO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE IT OUT FOR FREE. THAT LUMP SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN MY INITIAL $3,000. DON'T WORRY, IT WILL. YOU CAN LEAVE TOMORROW AND... I'LL GET THOSE STITCHES OUT FRIDAY. WELL, THERE'S JUST ONE MORE THING WORRYING ME. WITH MY NEW HIPS, DO YOU THINK I NEED MORE WORK UP HERE? YOU'RE LUCKY. IF YOU HAD BROKEN YOUR KNEE, I GUARANTEE IT WOULD HURT A LOT WORSE. SO WHAT SHAPE'S YOUR BIKE IN? WELL, RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE TWO UNICYCLES. OKAY, LAST STITCH. SOMEONE'S HERE TO SEE YOU, DR. HOWSER. WHOA. SHE'S BIGGER THAN THE TRUCK THAT RAN ME OFF THE ROAD. OUCH! SORRY. THE NOVOCAINE MUST BE WEARING OFF. PUT A DRESSING ON THAT WILL YOU, CURLY? YVETTE. HI. HI, DOOGIE. CAN WE GO SOMEWHERE AND TALK? UH, SURE. IT'S A LITTLE BUSY AROUND HERE TODAY, BUT I THINK WE CAN GRAB A FEW MINUTES. LET'S TRY IN HERE. I GUESS YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. YEAH, VINNY TOLD ME. HE DIDN'T TELL YOU THE WORST OF IT. AFTER I GOT BACK TO WANDA'S, I STARTED EATING... A LOT. - BINGING. - YOU COULD CALL IT THAT. ALL THEY HAVE LEFT IS A COUPLE OF CANS OF LENTIL SOUP. I HATE LENTILS. I HATE MYSELF. DOOGIE, I'M SCARED. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. HAVE YOU TRIED TO LOSE WEIGHT? ONCE WHEN I WAS 12. I LOST A LITTLE, BUT THEN I BLEW IT. I NEVER TRIED AGAIN. SOMETIMES IT'S EASIER TO STAY FAT THAN RISK BEING REJECTED. I GET REJECTED PLENTY. BELIEVE ME. JUST ASK YOUR PAL VINNY. FROM WHAT HE SAYS HE DIDN'T REJECT YOU. YOU SCARED HIM OFF. - HE HATES ME. - HE DOESN'T HATE YOU. YOU HATE YOU. I'M FAT. I'M UGLY. I'M ASHAMED TO LOOK AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR. WHAT'S NOT TO HATE? WHAT IF I FOUND YOU A GOOD DOCTOR WHO COULD GET YOU INTO A PROGRAM? - WOULD YOU TRY IT? - WHAT'S THE POINT? I'D SCREW IT UP! YOU WON'T KNOW IF YOU DON'T TRY. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE A COMMITMENT. A BIG ONE. HEY, BIG IS MY MIDDLE NAME. WILL YOU DO IT? OKAY. I'LL GIVE IT A TRY. OKAY. COOL. Doogie: I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, MOM. THIS WOMAN DOESN'T NEED ALL THAT SURGERY. IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT SOCIETY VALUES MEN AND WOMEN DIFFERENTLY. - IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR. - IT ISN'T. AS MEN GET OLDER THEY ARE CONSIDERED DISTINGUISHED, STATELY. AND WOMEN ARE JUST CONSIDERED OLDER. BUT SHE'S REALLY ATTRACTIVE. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT A LOT OF OLDER MEN DUMP THEIR WIVES - FOR YOUNGER WOMEN. - WELL, ALL I KNOW IS IT'S A SCREWY WORLD WHEN SOMEONE LIKE YVETTE IS SCARED TO LOSE WEIGHT AND CURLY SPAULDING WHO HAS A GREAT BODY IS EATING RABBIT FOOD JUST LOSE THREE LBS. I GUESS WOMEN ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO SOME INNER PEACE WITH WHO AND WHAT THEY ARE. I KNOW ONE THING, MOM. YOU LOOK MAHVELOUS, MY DARLING. YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT 'CAUSE I'M YOUR MOTHER. - NO, YOU REALLY DO. - WELL, THANK YOU, DOOGIE. HERE. YOU WANT ONE OF THESE? OH, NO. THOSE ARE 35 CALORIES. THESE ARE ONLY 18. EVERYTHING'S HEALING NICELY. THERE ARE NO INFECTIONS IN THE INCISIONS. - NO ADVERSE SWELLING. - YES, I'M VERY PLEASED. AND THAT PESKY LITTLE LUMP IS GONE. SO YOU'RE CLEAR TO GO HOME. WELL, THANK YOU, DR. HOWSER. AND I'LL SEE YOU NEXT MONTH. I'VE DECIDED TO HAVE MY ANKLES LIPOSUCTIONED. MRS. FABRE, IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT YOU HAVE GREAT ANKLES. - WORLD-CLASS ANKLES. - I WANT THEM TO BE PERFECT. NOBODY'S PERFECT. WHAT'S PERFECT ANYWAY? PERFECT IS WHEN PHIL FABRE SAYS, "HONEY, YOU'RE PERFECT." DOESN'T IT BOTHER YOU THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET? WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN? IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE ALREADY A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. ALL THIS SURGERY IS NOT GOING TO MAKE A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE. WELL, IT MAKES A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE TO ME. AND MAKES A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE TO MY PHIL! HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE COULD IT MAKE WHEN YOU'RE NEVER SATISFIED WITH THE WAY YOU LOOK? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME FEEL THIS WAY? - I JUST THINK... - GET OUT OF HERE! - MRS. FABRE. - PLEASE, JUST GO AWAY! I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU. LOOK, HOWSER. I'M NOT TAKING THIS TO CANFIELD. I'M GOING TO GIVE IT YOU MAN TO MAN, COLLEAGUE TO COLLEAGUE. IF YOU EVER, EVER, DISRUPT MY RELATIONSHIP WITH A PATIENT AGAIN, I'LL HAVE YOU UP ON CHARGES SO FAST YOUR HEAD WILL SPIN! - I DIDN'T THINK... - I GUESS YOU DIDN'T. WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, PRESUMING TO TELL MY PATIENT ANYTHING ABOUT HER EMOTIONAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS? SOMEONE'S GOT TO. SHE'S GOT A LOUSY SELF-IMAGE, AND ALL THE SURGERY IN THE WORLD'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE HER PROBLEMS, - AND YOU KNOW THAT. - I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SOLVE HER PROBLEMS, BUT AT LEAST I'M NOT CREATING NEW ONES FOR HER. - THIS WOMAN NEEDS HELP. - YOU'RE RIGHT. AND, GIVEN THE FACT THAT SHE WON'T SEE A PSYCHIATRIST, I'M THE NEXT BEST THING. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE NOT QUALIFIED TO DO WHAT I DO. WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? ABANDON HER TO THEM? YOU'RE A DAMNED GOOD DOCTOR, KID. BUT YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WIRE UP. AH! HEY. I WASN'T SCREAMING BECAUSE IT WAS YOU. YOU CAME AT A REALLY TENSE TIME. IT'S OKAY. - HOW DID YOU GET HERE? - DOOGIE AND WANDA DROPPED ME OFF. THEY TOLD ME YOU'D BE HERE. THE FINAL NIGHT OF "THE FLY." I DIDN'T MEAN TO RUIN IT FOR YOU THE LAST TIME. HEY, FORGET ABOUT IT. THESE THING HAPPEN AMONG FRIENDS. - ARE WE? - YEAH. I REALLY LIKE YOU, YVETTE. - WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. - US? WHAT? - WELL, YOU'RE, YOU KNOW... - FAT. YOU COULD CALL IT THAT, OKAY. AND ME, I'M SHORT. - VERY SHORT. - I NEVER NOTICED. OH YEAH. I'VE BEEN ON HOLD AT 5'3" FOR TWO YEARS. EVERY DAY IT'S, "HI, VIN. WANT TO BE DROPPED OFF AT SNOW WHITE'S HOUSE?" "HEY, WE'LL SPRAY YOUR HEAD WITH LEMON PLEDGE. YOU CAN WALK UNDER MY MOM'S COFFEE TABLE AND DUST IT." "VINNY, IF IT STARTS RAINING YOU'LL BE THE LAST GUY TO PUT ON A HAT." I'VE HEARD THEM ALL. EXCEPT YOU'VE GOT ONE BIG ADVANTAGE OVER ME. - WHAT? - WELL, I CAN'T MAKE MYSELF TALLER, BUT YOU CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT BEING FAT. I'M GOING TO. IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME YOU SEE ME I'LL BE SLIM ENOUGH TO OOZE THROUGH CHER'S BODYSTOCKING. I LIKE THOSE WORDS. AND I'M GONNA COME BACK TO SEE YOU. - I'M LIKING THAT EVEN BETTER. - AND YOU'RE GONNA WANT ME. DEFINITELY. AND YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA TURN ME DOWN. - WHY? - BECAUSE YOU'LL BE ALL SLIM AND GREAT, AND I'LL STILL BE SHORT AND WEIRD. MAYBE I LIKE SHORT AND WEIRD. YEAH? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. OOH. GET READY. THIS IS THE BEST PART. SHE'S ABOUT TO USE THAT IRON PRESS TO TURN HIS HEAD INTO PUDDING. - EWW! - EWW! GROSS. DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU TURNED IN? I CAN'T SLEEP. I FEEL AWFUL ABOUT WHAT I DID TO THAT WOMAN, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT RIGHT. WELL, YOU CAN'T. SO, LET THAT GO. WHAT YOU CAN DO IS LEARN SOMETHING FROM THE EXPERIENCE SO YOU DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE. BUT WHEN YOU SEE A PROBLEM DON'T YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO IDENTIFY IT? - SHE WASN'T YOUR PATIENT. - YVETTE WASN'T EITHER, NOT TECHNICALLY. SHE CAME TO YOU, THOUGH. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? THE DIFFERENCE IS SHE WANTED YOUR HELP. MRS. FABRE DIDN'T. I JUST FEEL SO SORRY FOR HER. YOU CAN'T ALWAYS FIX WHAT'S BROKEN. AND YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE AN ANSWER THAT SOMEBODY WANTS TO HEAR. HMM. I GUESS. HMM. GET SOME SLEEP, SON. THANKS, DAD.
