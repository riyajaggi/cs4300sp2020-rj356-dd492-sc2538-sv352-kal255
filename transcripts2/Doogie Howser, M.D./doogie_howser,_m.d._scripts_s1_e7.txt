 MY VIDEO CLASS TEACHER SAID, "PICK A SUBJECT YOU FIND FASCINATING," SO I PICKED YOU. I FIND YOU FASCINATING, TOO, IN A VERY DEMENTED, BIZARRE SORT OF WAY. BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE IN YOUR VIDEO. BESIDES, CANFIELD WILL NEVER GIVE YOU PERMISSION. - I ALREADY GOT IT. - WHAT? HEY, DOOG. THIS IS NOT HOLLYWOOD PHONY BALONEY. THIS IS NITTY-GRITTY-DOWN-AND-DIRTY DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKING. ANY CHANCE YOU'VE GOT TO USE THE JOHN? - GO! GET LOST. - OOH, I LIKE THAT. TELL ME TO GET LOST, ONLY THIS TIME HAVE FUN WITH IT. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE LISTENING TO ME. NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME WHAT I WANT TO HEAR. IT'S A TECHNIQUE I USE WITH MY MOTHER. I FIND IT VERY EFFECTIVE. I WONDER IF SPIELBERG HAD THESE PROBLEMS. IN SHORT, DR. HOWSER, I'M HOLDING YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF VINNY DELPINO WHILE HE'S IN THIS HOSPITAL MAKING HIS STUDENT VIDEO. THAT'S NOT FAIR. I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE IN VINNY'S VIDEO. DR. HOWSER, I'M NOT ANY HAPPIER ABOUT THIS THAN YOU ARE. HOWEVER, I WAS ASKED TO GIVE PERMISSION TO MR. DELPINO AS A PERSONAL FAVOR TO ANTHONY J. CASTALDO. THE SAME MR. CASTALDO THAT DONATED $2 MILLION TO EASTMAN MEDICAL AND WHO HAS PLEDGED TO MATCH THAT SUM THIS YEAR. DR. CANFIELD, SURELY OUR PRIVACY AND THE DIGNITY OF THIS HOSPITAL IS WORTH MORE THAN $4 MILLION. THIS IS GOING TO BE SO COOL. HEY, LOOK! ANTHONY J. CASTALDO. THAT'S THE GUY WHO GOT ME PERMISSION TO MAKE MY VIDEO IN THE HOSPITAL. MY MENTOR. MY PATRON. MY GOOMBAH. FORTUNATE THAT YOUR GOOMBAH HAS GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS IN YOUR VIDEO CLASS - WHO'S IN LOVE WITH YOU. - IT'S EVEN MORE FORTUNATE I NEVER DATED HER. YOU'RE NOT GONNA REGRET LETTING ME MAKE THIS VIDEO. I'M TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY. I HAVE A TOUGH ENOUGH TIME BEING A DOCTOR WITHOUT SOMEONE FOLLOWING ME WITH A CAMERA. I DON'T WANT THIS TO INTRUDE ON MY WORK. INTRUDE? WELL, THERE'S THE MISUNDERSTANDING. THE POINT OF MAKING THE DOCUMENTARY IS FOR THE DOCUMENTARIAN, THAT'S ME, TO STAND BACK AND OBSERVE. I'LL BE LIKE A FLY ON THE WALL. NOBODY WILL EVEN KNOW I'M HERE. WELL, HELLO, LADIES. I'M VINCENT DELPINO, FILMMAKER. THIS IS MY ESTEEMED SUBJECT, DR. DOUGLAS HOWSER. - VINNY, COULD YOU COOL IT? - I'M MAKING A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT DR. HOWSER. THAT'S IT. DON'T BE AFRAID OF INTIMACY. COULD YOU GIRLS CROWD AROUND HIM AND LOOK LIKE YOU'RE CONFERRING WITH HIM? NO, YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. ANGELS OF MERCY WITH THE DEDICATED YOUNG PHYSICIAN. A LITTLE MORE ADMIRATION, PLEASE, LADIES. LADIES, WET YOUR LIPS. THEY'LL LOOK BETTER ON CAMERA. VINNY. AGAIN, PLEASE. HOLY MACKEREL. WE HAVE AN ABDOMINAL WOUND HERE. - HELLO, DOCTOR. - IT HURTS. - OH GOD. I HATE THIS. - JUST BREATHE. I KNOW. I'LL STAY WITH YOU. I SIGNED ALL THE WAIVERS. NO WONDER GIRLS DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX. Vinny: HELLO THERE. I'M VINCENT DELPINO. DO YOU MIND IF I TAPE YOU FOR MY DOCUMENTARY? WHOA. NO PROBLEM. I UNDERSTAND. SOME GUYS JUST AIN'T THAT PHOTOGENIC. Hasta luego. - WHAT'S GOING ON? - CONSTRUCTION ACCIDENT. YOU BETTER NOT COME IN HERE. THIS COULD BE PRETTY MESSY. I CAN HANDLE IT. I'M A FILMMAKER. THIS IS ALL IN A DAY'S WORK TO ME. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE THE BOSS. I'M DR. HOWSER. - WHAT HAPPENED, BUD? - WAIT A MINUTE. - YOU'RE A KID. - TRUE, BUT I'M ALSO A GENIUS. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT, I CAN GET AN OLDER DOCTOR WHO'S NOT A SMART AS ME. SO DOC, I'M USING THE POWER SAW, THIS KILLER REDHEAD WALKS BY. NEXT THING I KNOW I'VE ONLY GOT NINE FINGERS. YEAH, I LIKE REDHEADS TOO. DO WE HAVE HIS THUMB? RIGHT HERE, DOCTOR. I HEARD YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO KEEP IT COLD, - BUT ALL I COULD FIND WAS A CUP OF ITALIAN ICE. - Vinny: OH, GROSS. Doogie: JUST A SEC, BUD. YOU OKAY, VINNY? - YOU FAINTED. YOU'LL BE FINE. - I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM. TAKE DEEP BREATHS. ARE YOU TRYING TO LOOK UP MY SKIRT? YES, MA'AM. HI, MEGAN. I'M DR. HOWSER. IT SAYS HERE YOU HURT YOUR ARM. - BRUCE PUSHED ME. - Woman: BRUCE IS THE DOG. THE TWO OF THEM WERE PLAYING ON THE BED AND SHE ROLLED OFF ON THE FLOOR. IT WAS THE KIND OF FALL KIDS TAKE ALL THE TIME. I WAS EXPECTING HER TO JUMP RIGHT UP, BUT INSTEAD SHE STARTED SCREAMING. - IS IT OKAY IF LOOK AT YOUR ARM, MEGAN? - UH-UH. I UNDERSTAND IT HURTS PRETTY BAD, HUH? - DOOG. - COME ON IN, VINNY. MEGAN, THIS IS MY FRIEND VINNY. HE'S MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT ME BEING A DOCTOR. VINNY, DO YOU THINK THERE'S A PART FOR MEGAN IN THE MOVIE? ARE YOU KIDDING? THOSE LIPS, THOSE EYES. SHE'S A YOUNG MOLLY RINGWALD. DO YOU WANT TO BE MY CO-STAR? GO AHEAD, HONEY. GREAT. LET'S SEE... WHAT CAN WE BE DOING THAT'S DOCTOR-LIKE? YOU COULD LOOK AT MY ARM. THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. VINNY. OKAY. ACTION. I'LL BE VERY CAREFUL. PUSH AGAINST MY HAND AS HARD AS YOU CAN. IS IT BROKEN? I WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY OFFICIALLY TILL WE GET AN X-RAY, BUT IT SURE LOOKS THAT WAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. ALL SHE DID WAS ROLL OFF THE BED. I WOULDN'T WORRY SO MUCH. SOMETIMES KIDS JUST FALL IN FUNNY WAYS. IS THERE KISSING IN THIS MOVIE? ANYTHING VINNY'S INVOLVED IN GETS TO THAT EVENTUALLY. OKAY. HOW OLD IS THE CHILD? - SIX. - THAT FRACTURE IS NOT THROUGH NORMAL BONE. THERE'S A BONY LESION AROUND THE FRACTURE SITE. - THAT'S WHY THE ARM BROKE SO EASILY. - EXACTLY. BUT THERE ARE BENIGN POSSIBILITIES. IT COULD BE... OSTEOMYELITIS. WE WON'T KNOW UNTIL AFTER A BIOPSY. LOOK, DR. HOWSER, WE'RE ALL HOPING FOR THE BEST, BUT YOU CAN'T BE EVASIVE WITH THIS GIRL'S PARENTS. YOU'VE GOT TO PREPARE THEM FOR WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE. EWING SARCOMA. YOU BETTER HANG BACK ON THIS ONE, VINNY. NOW WAY, MAN. THE DEAL WE MADE IS TOTAL ACCESS. - I GET TO GO ANYWHERE. - NOT THIS TIME. - BUT THAT'S OUR DEAL! - VINNY, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'VE GOT TO GO IN THERE AND TELL THAT WOMAN HER DAUGHTER MAY HAVE CANCER. Miss Anne Lloyd to pediatrics. Miss Anne Lloyd to pediatrics. HI, MAN. ALL RIGHT, BACK FROM VACATION. Dr. Murray, call your service. Dr. Murray, call your service. DON'T FORGET WE'RE HAVING DINNER AT THE LEWIS'S TONIGHT. OH YES. SOMETHING FROM THE SEA. POACHED, NO BUTTER. TOP OF THE MORNING TO YOU, DR. H., MRS. H.! DOOGIE TOLD ME TO WAIT FOR HIM DOWN HERE. WE'RE RIDING TO THE HOSPITAL TOGETHER. GOOD MORNING, VINNY. SO, DR. HOWSER... HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING A SON WHO'S LIKE 10 TIMES SMARTER THAN YOU? I THINK YOU'RE EXAGGERATING, VINCENT. - NO. NO WAY. - I THINK YOU ARE. BUT OF COURSE, HAVING A SON LIKE DOOGIE MAKES ME VERY PROUD. DID YOU EVER NOTICE WHEN YOU GET MAD THIS VEIN IN YOUR FOREHEAD TURNS PURPLE AND STARTS TO BULGE? YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT. MAYBE IT'S TIME TO PUT THE CAMERA DOWN AND EAT SOME BREAKFAST. OH THANKS, BUT I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY. - VINNY! - YES, MA'AM. MY VIDEO'S GOING GREAT. I'VE BEEN WITH DOOGIE DAY AND NIGHT FOR THREE DAYS NOW. I THINK I'M REALLY GETTING INSIDE HIS SKIN. I CAN IMAGINE. OH, BY THE WAY, MRS. H., ABOUT YESTERDAY MORNING, BELIEVE ME, IF I KNEW THAT YOU WERE PARADING AROUND IN THE HALLWAY LIKE THAT, I WOULD'VE NEVER COME UPSTAIRS UNANNOUNCED. WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT, KATHERINE? JUST A BRIEF, UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER, DEAR. YOU'RE A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, MRS. HOWSER. - VINCENT? - NOT TO WORRY, DR. H. I ALREADY ERASED THE TAPE. SCOUT'S HONOR. AND I NEVER ONCE USED MY ZOOM. KATHERINE? HEY. HEY, HOWSER, WAIT UP! CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? HE FORGOT ME. WHAT AN ECCENTRIC GENIUS. - HI, MEGAN. - HI. I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING FOR YOUR SPLINT. WHAT? HEY! THAT'S PRETTY. TODAY IS THE DAY OF MY OPERATION, RIGHT? YEAH, IT'S CALLED A BIOPSY, REMEMBER? IS IT GOING TO HURT? - YES. - UH-OH. LOOK. MEGAN. WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE, I WAS SICK. AND THE DOCTOR TOLD ME SOMETHING WASN'T GOING TO HURT, AND THEN IT DID. AND FROM THEN ON I DIDN'T TRUST HIM. AND EVERY TIME HE DID SOMETHING TO ME AFTER THAT, I WAS MORE AFRAID THAN I HAD TO BE, SO, I PROMISED MYSELF WHEN I BECAME A DOCTOR, I WOULD NEVER LIE TO A KID. OKAY, AND I'M NEVER GOING TO LIE TO YOU EITHER. PERFECT. SO, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WHEN YOU WAKE UP FROM YOUR OPERATION, YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL ICKY, YOUR THROAT'S GOING TO HURT, YOUR ARM'S GOING TO HURT, AND YOU MIGHT EVEN THROW UP. - UGH. - YEAH. IT'S A DRAG. BUT I PROMISE, THE FIRST PERSON YOU SEE WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES IS ME. AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING, ANYTHING AT ALL, JUST ASK... AND I'LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH. 'CAUSE YOU'LL NEVER LIE TO A KID, RIGHT? YEAH. - Woman: GET OUT OF HERE! - Vinny: DON'T BE ALARMED. I'M A FILMMAKER. THIS ISN'T A GRATUITOUS SPONGE BATH. IT'S AN ORGANIC PART OF MY VIDEO. GET OUT OF HERE! - YO, DOOG! - HI, VINNY. - WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - IN SURGERY. MEGAN HAD HER BIOPSY. - HOW DID IT GO? - VINNY, IT WOULD BE A BREACH OF ETHICS TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU BEFORE I DISCUSS IT WITH HER PARENTS. NO PROBLEM. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BREACH ANYTHING. BUT COULD YOU DO ME A FAVOR? COULD YOU COME OFF THE ELEVATOR AGAIN? WHAT? AND PUT THE MASK ON. IT'S A VERY MEDICAL LOOK. VINNY, GET THAT CAMERA OUT OF MY FACE. YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T HAD A PRIVATE MOMENT FOR THREE DAYS. I'M ON MY WAY TO TALK TO THESE PARENTS ABOUT THEIR KID'S OPERATION, AND YOU STICK A CAMERA IN MY FACE. - I'M A FILMMAKER. - WOULD YOU STOP WITH THIS FILMMAKER CRAP? THIS IS LIKE 50,000 OF THOSE OTHER THINGS YOU'RE GONNA BE! WHEN YOU WERE SIX YEARS OLD AND YOU TURNED TO ME IN THE SANDBOX AND SAID TO ME, "I'M GONNA BE A DOCTOR," I DIDN'T LAUGH AT YOU! AND BELIEVE ME, DOOG, THERE WERE PLENTY OF GUYS THAT WOULD HAVE! - VINNY. - I'M ALMOST DONE! NO, YOU'RE NOT ALMOST DONE. YOU'RE COMPLETELY DONE. FADE OUT. THE END. GOODBYE. - YEAH? - THE STRANGEST THING JUST HAPPENED. THE DOORBELL RANG. I ANSWERED IT. AND VINCENT DELPINO WALKED IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR. IS YOUR WINDOW STUCK? WHAT'S THAT? THE GREAT VIDEO? YEAH. HE ASKED ME TO GIVE IT YOU. I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT. WHY NOT? IT'S PROBABLY TOTALLY EMBARRASSING. - MAYBE NOT. - DAD, HE ACTS LIKE A KID. HE'S TOTALLY INSENSITIVE, AND HALF THE TIME HE'S OUT OF CONTROL. HE IS IMPULSIVE. REMEMBER YOUR MEDICAL SCHOOL COMMENCEMENT? HE STOOD UP ON HIS CHAIR AND SCREAMED, "YO, WAY TO GO, HOWSER!" HE WAS NEXT TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER. I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO FAINT. AND REMEMBER WHEN ALL YOUR HAIR FELL OUT FROM THE CHEMOTHERAPY? VINNY MARCHED RIGHT INTO THE BATHROOM AND SHAVED HIS HEAD AS A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY. JUST IN CASE. - WELL, GOOD NIGHT, SON. - GOOD NIGHT, DAD. ♪ Clean shirt, new shoes ♪ ♪ And I don't know what I am gonna do ♪ ♪ Silk suit, black tie ♪ ♪ I'll don't need a reason why... ♪ Hello. I'll be there in a second. ♪ 'Cause every girl crazy about a sharp dressed man. ♪ Dr. Howser, I'd like you to meet some colleagues from Japan. They're here to study our trauma center. These are Doctors Nakayama, Tanaka, Masuda and Shimizu. Ah, you're the man! Katherine: He picked it up from the gardener. As soon as I realized he had such a facility for languages, we started taking a Spanish class together. And by the end of the week, he was helping me with my homework. That's how it started. Vinny: Thank God for mothers, because in the early years there were those who had their doubts. To tell you the truth, I never saw anything special in the boy. He constantly questioned my authority. He was never neat and tidy. He refused to color inside the lines. He ate paste. I've never had a three-year-old call me a bureaucrat before. - Vinny! - Vinny: Come on, Wanda. I want to know about Doogie Howser the lover. You better talk to him now, or he'll be bugging us all night. Okay, Vinny. Doogie Howser is the gentlest, sweetest guy I've ever gone out with. When I first heard about him, I thought he would be some kind of brainy conehead. But he's not like that at all. When it comes to girls, he's really kind of dumb. - Hey. - No. I like that. I like it a lot. Doogie Howser, he's one of the better residents in the hospital. The best. Vinny: But being the best almost wasn't enough. I'll be honest. My initial reaction was to reject Douglas Howser for residency at this hospital. I quite frankly didn't feel that a 16-year-old could handle the physical or emotional demands. Whatever else you learn about Dr. Howser - you should know that he is under... - Come on! Incredible pressure. Doogie: No, come on! Come on! Canfield: Incredible pressure. And if he blows once in awhile, well, we all do. - Vinny. - Vinny: I'm almost done! No, you're not almost done. You're completely done. Fade out. The end. Goodbye. That a 16-year-old boy can acquit himself as well as he does is a testament to his abilities. I guess for me the hardest part about being a doctor is learning to keep an emotional distance, so I don't get bummed out by the terrible things I see. But at the same time, I don't want to protect myself so much emotionally that I'm not affected as a human being. - Hi. - I'm in this because I like people, right? We've totally ruled out Ewing sarcoma. It was a benign lesion. It's a rare condition called histiocytosis. Are you saying it's not cancer? That's exactly what I'm saying. The surgery removed all traces of the lesion, and there's no concern about a reoccurrence. Megan's absolutely fine. Thank God! Thank you. So, that's my friend Doogie Howser. Even though he's a genius and a doctor and mostly perfect, he can be as big a jerk as the next guy. And I appreciate that. It makes us more like equals. Otherwise, how could we be best friends, right? I guess that's it. Except for one other thing... I've known Doogie since we were five years old. He's like a permanent fixture in my life. If something is going to be there permanently like your mother, your sister or something, you would be pretty lucky to get Doogie Howser. At least, that's how I feel. This is Vincent Delpino. Good night.
