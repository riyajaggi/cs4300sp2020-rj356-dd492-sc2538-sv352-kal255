A MATURE PERSON DOESN'T WEAR AN EARRING, CUT HOLES IN A BRAND NEW PAIR OF JEANS AND CALL HIS FATHER "MUNGO DUDE." - RIGHT, DEAR? - I LIKE THE EARRING. I THINK IT'S SEXY. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME... I HAVE TO GET MY BEEPER. I'M ON CALL TONIGHT. I THINK WE SHOULD BE GOING, DEAR. WAIT. DAD, WHAT IF I PROMISE THAT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOUR CAR? I AM SORRY, SON. BESIDES, I'M NOT EVEN SURE THAT YOU ARE COVERED ON MY INSURANCE TO DRIVE IT. JUST HAVE TO GET A RIDE WITH ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS, OR YOU COULD TAKE YOUR OWN CAR. YOU ARE DESTROYING MY REPUTATION. IF YOUR REPUTATION HINGES ON IMPRESSING A BUNCH OF KIDS WITH YOUR FATHER'S CAR, I'D SAY THEY WEREN'T VERY GOOD FRIENDS. YOU BOUGHT THE CAR TO IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS. DON'T BE SMART. I CAN'T HELP IT. PLEASE, JUST THIS ONCE? DOUGLAS, I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND. NO, YOU'VE CLOSED YOUR MIND. THAT'S ENOUGH, DOUGLAS. THE MOVIE GETS OUT AT 10:30. WE'LL BE HOME BY 11:00. MOM, THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ME. DOOGIE, TRY TO UNDERSTAND... YOUR FATHER LOVES HIS CAR VERY MUCH. HE HAS A SPECIAL... RELATIONSHIP WITH IT. - IT'S SICK. - HE'S JUST VERY PARTICULAR ABOUT IT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE TAKING MY CAR TONIGHT. HE DOESN'T WANNA PARK HIS ON THE STREET. I JUST WANNA USE IT ONCE. MAYBE I CAN CHANGE HIS MIND. Howser: DON'T EVEN TRY. SO WHAT'RE YOU DOING, EINSTEIN? MY DAD HAS A SPARE SET OF KEYS TO THE BMW IN A WALL SAFE AND HE'S GOT A PRIVATE FILE ON HIS COMPUTER WITH IMPORTANT STUFF ON IT, LIKE THE COMBINATION TO THE SAFE. NOW, I'VE COPIED HIS PROGRAM, IF I CAN JUST FIND THE PASSWORD, THEN I CAN GET IN. I'VE GOT IT, IGOR. WHEN YOU POKED A HOLE IN YOUR EAR, I THINK YOU WENT ALL THE WAY INTO YOUR BRAIN. VINNIE, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? YOU SPIT WHEN YOU GET EXCITED, DOOG. THIS MEANS I CAN TAKE MY FATHER'S CAR TO THE PARTY. YOU GONNA TAKE YOUR FATHER'S CAR? - YEAH. - WITHOUT YOUR FATHER'S PERMISSION? EXACTLY. WE HAVE LIFTOFF. I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA STEAL YOUR DAD'S MOST PRIZED POSSESSION IN THE WORLD? EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW THAT IF HE EVER FOUND OUT HE WOULD KILL YOU AND MAKE YOU PAY AND SUFFER FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE? AHA... BUT HE WON'T FIND OUT. RIGHT. DON'T YOU HAVE TO SANDPAPER YOUR FINGERS OR SOMETHING? THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE RIGHT COMBINATION. OKAY, LET'S TRY HER. I'M SWEATING IN PLACES I DON'T WANNA TALK ABOUT. Doogie: WAIT TILL GRIFFIN SEES THIS. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. OH, VIN... GRIFFIN INVITED ME. SO I DON'T THINK I CAN BRING ANYONE ELSE. I GUESS IT'S NOT AN OPEN PARTY. - OH, RIGHT. - LOOK, VINNIE, I... NO, FORGET IT, DOOG. IF I'M NOT COOL ENOUGH, I DON'T WANNA GO. - VINNIE... - NO, IT'S OKAY. - YOU'RE IN WITH THE POPULAR GUYS. - IT'S JUST ONE PARTY. LOOK, DOOG, I GET THE MESSAGE. YOU DON'T NEED ME ANYMORE. WOW! THIS CAR HAS SEVERE SPEAKERS. - WICKED. - YOU'RE A VICIOUS DUDE, DOC. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR FATHER LET YOU USE HIS CAR. HE MUST REALLY TRUST YOU. YEAH... WATCH YOUR STEP, SUSAN. YOU DON'T WANNA RUIN THOSE SPIKED HEELS ON THE UPHOLSTERY. THANKS, DOC. WHAT'S WRONG, DOOGIE? I'M NOT SO SURE THIS IS THE BEST PLACE TO PARK THE CAR. HEY, DOUG. DON'T SPAZZ OUT ON ME, THE CAR WILL BE FINE. AND SO WILL WE, ONCE WE GO INSIDE AND PARTY. YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M CHARGED UP, IT'S PARTY TIME. IT IS JUST THAT I HAVE TO BE AT THE HOSPITAL BY 11:00, AND I'M ON THE LATE SHIFT. OTHERWISE I'D STAY. HEY, IT'S COOL. YOU CAN DROP US OFF AT ELLEN'S. SHE'S HAVING A PARTY TO CELEBRATE THIS PARTY. OH MY GOD. IT'S STOLEN. OH MY GOD. OH MY GOD, I'M DEAD. MY FATHER IS GOING TO KILL ME. HEY, DOC, DON'T WIG OUT HERE. THIS WASN'T YOUR FAULT. YOUR DAD LET YOU USE THE CAR. CAN'T HELP IT IF IT GOT STOLEN. YEAH, HEY, NOW YOU GOT AN EXCUSE TO STAY AND PARTY, MAN. YOU JUST TELL YOUR DAD, "HEY, HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO GET HOME? THE CAR WAS STOLEN." NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THIS WAS MY FAULT. I TOOK THE CAR WITHOUT MY FATHER'S PERMISSION. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME? LOOK, WE GOTTA CALL THE POLICE. IT'S NOT STOLEN, IT'S BEEN TOWED. I'M GONNA LIVE. - WHAT TIME IS IT? - IT'S 10:00. I'M GONNA DIE. LOOK, I'M VERY SORRY. I KNOW IF THAT WERE ME, MY DAD'S CAR GOT TOWED... I'D BE SWEATING BULLETS. BUT IT'S NOT! HEY, DUDE, ALL RIGHT. HEY, JESSIE, CAN YOU GIVE US A RIDE OVER TO ELLEN'S? Jessie: YEAH, SURE, COME ON. Doogie: IF I DON'T GET THE CAR BACK INTO THE GARAGE BY 11:00, MY PARENTS ARE GONNA KILL ME. JUST LET ME TAKE THE CAR AND I PROMISE TOMORROW I WILL GO TO THE BANK AND GET YOUR MONEY. YOU WANT THE CAR, YOU CAN PAY THE FINE. $127. BUT I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY WITH ME. THEN YOU DON'T GET THE CAR. THIS IS INFANTILE. LEGALLY YOU HAVE NO BASIS TO HOLD MY CAR WHEN I CAN OFFER SUFFICIENT AND PROPORTIONATE COLLATERAL AS COMPENSATION. TAKE MY WATCH, TAKE MY GIRLFRIEND. MY FATHER IS GONNA PULVERIZE ME INTO DEAD MEAT IF I DON'T HAVE THAT CAR BACK IN 10 MINUTES. - OH, THANK GOD. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SHOW A LITTLE GRATITUDE, I'M ABOUT TO SAVE YOUR SNOTTY BUTT. I CALLED HIM, DOOGIE. YOU'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. STEP ASIDE. YOU GOTTA KNOW HOW TO TALK TO THESE PEOPLE. - YO! - YO! - SEE? HOW MUCH? - $127. TOOK ME THREE YEARS TO SAVE THIS. I'LL TAKE YOU HOME, WANDA. VINNIE, I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS. YOU'RE A GREAT FRIEND. - WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOU. - DOOGIE, GO. - DON'T BE MAD AT HIM, VINNIE. - WHY NOT? GRIFFIN JUST SUCKED HIM IN. WE ALL THOUGHT HE WAS SO COOL... HE TURNED OUT TO BE SUCH A JERK. YEAH, A JERK THAT MY BEST FRIEND DUMPED ME FOR. HE DIDN'T MEAN TO. HE KNOWS WHAT A GOOD FRIEND YOU ARE. YEAH? WELL, HE SHOULD KNOW HOW HARD IT IS FOR ME TO BE HIS FRIEND. I MEAN, HOW MANY GUYS WOULD HANG OUT WITH SOMEONE WHO WORKS WEEKENDS AND GETS JAZZED OVER STUFF LIKE BLOOD, KIDNEYS AND MUCUS? I THINK DOOGIE IS REALLY LUCKY TO HAVE YOU AS A BEST FRIEND. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. I AM HIS BEST FRIEND. I MEAN, WHO ELSE IS GONNA DELIVER THE EULOGY? - WHAT EULOGY? - THE ONE HE'S GONNA NEED WHEN HIS FATHER KILLS HIM. Howser: NOW THAT WAS A GREAT MOVIE. HI, HONEY. HOW WAS YOUR EVENING? NOTHING SPECIAL. I'M JUST KIND OF ENGROSSED IN THIS SHOW. Man on TV: just take a little of the... oh my gosh, take a little of a spray-on mousse, something that's very, very light. Okay... YOU'LL NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU'LL NEED ME TO GIVE YOU A HAIRCUT, MOM. YES, WELL... I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS. Man on TV: just gonna take the dryer... - GOOD NIGHT, DOOGIE. - GOOD NIGHT, MOM. DOUGLAS, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU. YEAH, DAD? I BELIEVE I WAS UNFAIR TO YOU TONIGHT. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT AND I WAS WRONG. I SHOULD HAVE LET YOU BORROW MY CAR. OH NO, IT'S OKAY, REALLY. NO, IT ISN'T. YOU HAVE PROVEN YOURSELF TO BE TRUSTWORTHY AND RESPONSIBLE AND I REALIZE THAT YOU WOULD NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE OF DRIVING MY CAR. NO, SON, I AM AFRAID THAT I JUDGED A BOOK BY ITS COVER. AND IF THERE WAS EVER ANYBODY IN THIS WORLD WHO SHOULDN'T BE JUDGED BY APPEARANCES, IT'S YOU. NOW, THIS IS ONLY A SYMBOLIC GESTURE, BUT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HAVE THE SPARE SET OF KEYS TO THE CAR. Mother: I'LL GET IT. NO, DON'T, DAD, THAT ISN'T NECESSARY. - YES, IT IS. - Katherine: DAVID, IT'S THE HOSPITAL. OH. Howser: HELLO? START AN I.V. WITH DEXTROSE AND SALINE AND KEEP HIM N.P.O. PUT AN NG2 BY THE BEDSIDE, I'LL BE THERE IN 15 MINUTES. SON, YOU HAVE EARNED THESE. BECAUSE YOU'VE EARNED MY FAITH AND MY TRUST. I ADMIT I'M A LITTLE EMBARRASSED... THAT I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS BEFORE AND I HOPE THIS WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU. TELL YOUR MOTHER I HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. YOU CALLED ME. WHAT DO YOU WANT? - DO YOU WANNA COME IN? - I'M NOT SURE. I'M GONNA GO TO THE BANK FIRST THING TOMORROW AND GET YOUR MONEY. YEAH, YOU'RE GOOD FOR IT. I DON'T SEE ANY BRUISES. I GUESS YOU GOT AWAY WITH IT. YEAH. MY FATHER EVEN GAVE ME THE SPARE SET OF KEYS TO THE BMW. OH, THAT'S GREAT. GRIFFIN DESERTED ME... IN A SECOND. AND EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T BRING YOU TO THE PARTY, YOU SAVED MY BUTT TONIGHT. I AM A GREAT GUY. LET'S TAKE YOUR DAD'S CAR FOR A SPIN TOMORROW. - I CAN'T. - YOU CAN. NO, I FEEL TOO GUILTY. I'M NOT SURE I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO DRIVE IT AGAIN. Both: NAH. I GOTTA GO. - WELCOME BACK. - IT'S NICE TO BE BACK. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
