 FINE. YOU? PIECE OF CAKE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS. I SHOWERED TWO MINUTES AGO AND I'M DRENCHED ALREADY. WHEN ARE THEY GONNA FIX THE DAMN A.C.? HEY, DOOG. I JUST HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. UNBELIEVABLE. ARE YOU OKAY? YEAH, I GUESS. - YOU GOT A DATE? - UH-HUH. MAYBE YOU OUGHT TO JUST GO HOME, CHILL OUT. NO WAY. CHECK IT OUT... MY TICKET TO THE STONES CONCERT. 16th ROW. I'VE HAD IT FOR THREE MONTHS. WELL, I'VE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS AND BAD NEWS. - THEN HURRY. - THE GOOD NEWS IS THE CONCERT WAS GREAT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WAS? THAT'S THE BAD NEWS. IT WAS LAST NIGHT. HECTOR GONZALES, AGE 13. BROUGHT TO EASTMAN THREE DAYS AGO FROM GUATEMALA BY THE ST. PETER'S HOLY CROSS MISSION. OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS HE HAD EXHIBITED PROGRESSIVE MOTOR DEFICITS IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES, INCLUDING LOSS OF BLADDER AND BOWEL FUNCTION EVENTUALLY LEADING TO TOTAL PARALYSIS. DR. GORING FELT IT UNNECESSARY TO DO AN M.R.I. OR ANY SKIN TESTS FOR POSSIBLE INFECTION. YESTERDAY HE ORDERED A CAT SCAN. AND AS I SUSPECTED WE HAVE A SPACE-OCCUPYING LESION IN THE LEFT TEMPORAL LOBE WITH BRAINSTEM PRESSURE. IT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD. A STANDARD CRANIOTOMY. I'VE SCHEDULED SURGERY FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON. - ANY QUESTIONS? - Doogie: YES, SIR. HOW CAN WE BE SURE IT'S NOT AN INFLAMMATORY MASS? WE NEVER DID A COMPLETE WORK-UP. THERE WAS NO TIME. THIS KID'S CONDITION IS DETERIORATING RAPIDLY. THE PICTURES TELL THE STORY. THAT TUMOR COMES OUT OR HE'S GOING TO DIE. - GOOD MORNING. - Buenos días, DR. HOWSER. Buenos días, MR. GONZALES. HOW IS EVERYONE TODAY? - FINE. - HOW ARE YOU FEELING, YOUNG MAN? DOOGIE. WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? HECTOR'S FAMILY. THEY ARRIVED YESTERDAY. WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN HOSPITAL GOWNS? SOCIAL SERVICES SAID IT WOULD TAKE TWO WEEKS TO FIND THEM A PLACE TO STAY. THEY HAVE NO MONEY, SO I ADMITTED THEM. ARE YOU CRAZY? IF CANFIELD FINDS OUT, HE'LL KILL YOU. HE'LL NEVER KNOW. THEY'RE IN THE COMPUTER UNDER A BUNCH OF ALIASES. COME ON. I'VE HEARD OF SOME PRETTY DUMB IDEAS, BUT THIS IS... WHO IS THAT? Doogie: MARIA. HECTOR'S SISTER. SHE'S INCREDIBLE. HOWSER, YOU'RE A GENIUS! THANK YOU FOR THE BASEBALL CARDS, DOCTOR. BUT HECTOR HAS HAD MANY SORES IN HIS MOUTH. CHEWING GUM IS A PROBLEM. HERPES ENCEPHALITIS? COME ON, DR. HOWSER, YOU'RE REACHING. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE HERPES SORES IN THEIR MOUTH AND DON'T GET ENCEPHALITIS. HE'S HAD A FEVER SINCE HE GOT HERE. HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? THE TUMOR'S NECROTIC. THE EXPANSION'S CAUSING PRESSURE. JUST LOOK AT HIS EYE GROUNDS. MAYBE, BUT CAN YOU TELL ME YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE? DR. GORING, ALL I ASK IS WE HOLD OFF SURGERY FOR A DAY. I KNOW A SPINAL TAP IS OUT, BUT IF I DO A CISTERNA MAGNA TAP THEN WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE. - I AM SURE, DOCTOR. - COME ON. LOOK. ALL MY INSTINCTS TELL ME I'M RIGHT, BUT JUST TO SATISFY YOUR CURIOSITY, GO PERFORM YOUR TEST. HOWEVER, HIS SURGERY STAYS SCHEDULED FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON. NOW LET'S MOVE ON. EXCUSE ME. DR. HOWSER? MY NAME IS GARRET PRICE. - AND THIS IS MY PARTNER DR. ALLEN BRADY. - HI. - NICE TO MEET YOU. - WE COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR YOUR DEBATE WITH DR. GORING. WE WERE VERY IMPRESSED. - WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT YOU. - ALLEN AND I OWN THE BRENTWOOD PEDIATRIC GROUP, AND WE WERE WONDERING IF WE COULD TAKE YOU TO LUNCH TODAY. - SURE. - GREAT. "OPIE TAYLOR." "LORI PARTRIDGE." "THURSTON HOWELL III." - I OWN A TELEVISION. - I CAN EXPLAIN. YOU MADE AN UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY INTO THE COMPUTER IN TOTAL DISREGARD OF HOSPITAL PROCEDURE. THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR THEM TO GO. WE HAVE SOCIAL SERVICES TO HANDLE THESE MATTERS. THEY HANDLED IT. THEY TOLD THEM TO FILL OUT THE PAPERWORK AND WAIT. - WAIT WHERE? - HOW ABOUT THE WAITING ROOM? THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR. I WISH WE COULD ACCOMMODATE THEM, BUT WE'RE NOT RUNNING A HOTEL. THOSE BEDS ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM. BOTTOM LINE, YOU USED BAD JUDGMENT, AND I'M GROWING TIRED OF IT. - IS THAT ALL? - YES! THAT'S ALL! IT'S A JOKE. CANFIELD'S SO CAUGHT UP IN HOSPITAL RED TAPE, HE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S IMPORTANT. IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR HECTOR'S FAMILY, I MIGHT NEVER HAVE MADE THAT DIAGNOSIS. - YOU STILL COULD BE WRONG. - UH-UH. IF HE'S GOT A TUMOR, I'LL EAT YOUR NAME TAG. LET IT GO, GUY. YOU'RE BENT OUT OF SHAPE BECAUSE OF THE HEAT. - WE ALL ARE. - IT'S NOT JUST THE HEAT, IT'S EVERYTHING. SOMEONE I'M TRYING TO SAVE ALMOST KILLS ME, I'VE WORKED 40 OUT OF THE LAST 48 HOURS, WANDA'S NOT SPEAKING TO ME BECAUSE I NEVER SHOWED UP AT THE STONES CONCERT, AND I HAVE TO DO A DANCE TO GET ANYONE TO LISTEN TO ME HERE. SUCH IS THE LIFE OF A SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT. YOU'LL JUST GET USED TO IT. YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE. WHY NOT? WHO WOULD CARE IF I WAS GONE? - I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER. - HEY, DOOGIE. I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW I WOULD CARE. THINGS WOULDN'T BE THE SAME WITHOUT YOU. - THANKS, JACK. - I MEAN, YOU'RE A GREAT DOCTOR. - I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD REALIZE THAT. - WHAT DO YOU WANT, JACK? - THE KID'S SISTER, MARIA. - NO WAY. I'VE GOT TO MEET HER. SHE'S AN ANGEL. YOU KNOW SPANISH BETTER THAN I DO. JUST TELL HER WHAT A GREAT GUY I AM AND THAT I'D BE INTERESTED IN TAKING HER TO DINNER. MUY INTERESTED. FORGET IT. MARIA IS A SWEET, INNOCENT CATHOLIC GIRL. - I KNOW. - I WOULDN'T FEED HER TO A SHARK LIKE YOU. - DOOGIE. - JACK, I'VE GOTTA GO. I'M GONNA DO THIS WITH OR WITHOUT YOUR HELP. COME ON, DOOGIE. PLEASE? KEITH RICHARDS WAS GREAT, AND JAGGER'S VOICE SOUNDED AS GOOD AS EVER. - TOO BAD YOU MISSED IT. - YOU'RE TELLING ME. LOOK. IF YOU EVER NEED TICKETS FOR ANYTHING, LET US KNOW. A GUY FROM CAPITOL RECORDS BRING HIS KIDS TO SEE US. ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH OF THE ROLLING STONES. LET ME TELL HIM WHY WE ASKED HIM TO LUNCH. DOOGIE, STOP ME IF I'M WRONG. YOU WORK 24-HOUR SHIFTS, YOU SLEEP ON A COT, YOU SHOWER WITH YOUR BEEPER AND IF YOU DIVIDE YOUR PAY BY THE HOURS YOU WORK, YOU BARELY TOP MINIMUM WAGE. - YOU GOT IT. - Brady: YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? I THINK SO. - YOU JUST BREAK ANOTHER DATE? - YEAH. WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHAT IF YOU COULD WORK AT A FIRST-RATE FACILITY WITH MINIMUM ON-CALL TIME? A PLACE THAT OFFERED A PENSION AND PROFIT-SHARING PLAN SECOND TO NONE, AND IT COVERED ALL MALPRACTICE INSURANCE. - WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED? - SURE, BUT I STILL HAVE ANOTHER YEAR TO GO ON MY RESIDENCY. EASTMAN IS AN OUTSTANDING TEACHING HOSPITAL, AND THEIR RESIDENCY PROGRAM IS TOP-NOTCH. BUT WE'LL BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU. ONE OF THE REASONS WE WANT YOU NOW IS THAT YOU'RE ONE OF A KIND. A 16-YEAR-OLD IN A PEDIATRIC PRACTICE IS LIKE GOLD. AND IF YOU WANT TO BECOME A CARDIOLOGIST OR WHATEVER, IN FOUR YEARS YOU WOULD STILL BE THE YOUNGEST RESIDENT IN THE COUNTRY. WE'RE PREPARED TO OFFER YOU $100,000 A YEAR TO START... WITH AN OPTION TO BECOME A FULL PARTNER AT THE CONCLUSION OF THAT YEAR. PLUS, OF COURSE, THE USE OF OUR BEACH HOUSE IN MALIBU AND SIX WEEKS VACATION. DID YOU GET TO GO - TO EUROPE AFTER COLLEGE? - I WAS 10. OH. RIGHT. WELL, NOW YOU'LL GET A CHANCE. LOOK. WE DON'T WANT TO HARD SELL YOU HERE. WE JUST WANT YOU TO COME SEE OUR PLACE. WE THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT. HI, DR. PRICE. HI, DR. BRADY. - HI, KELLY. - HELLO. - WHO WAS THAT? - Brady: KELLY... ONE OF OUR NURSES. IT'S HER DAY OFF. SHE'S A TWIN. DAD, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $100,000 PLUS A PARTNERSHIP AFTER ONE YEAR. THIS IS NOT ABOUT MONEY, THIS ABOUT YOUR EDUCATION. YOU HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO EASTMAN, AND I THINK YOU ARE BETTER SERVED KEEPING IT. BUT THIS IS A CHANCE FOR ME TO HAVE A NORMAL LIFE. I MAY EVEN GET TO SEE WANDA MORE THAN ONCE A MONTH. YOU DON'T BECOME A TOP PHYSICIAN BY TAKING SHORTCUTS, YOUNG MAN. THIS IS NOT A SHORTCUT. THESE ARE TWO WELL-RESPECTED DOCTORS WITH A GREAT PRACTICE. IF YOU ASK ME, I THINK THEY HAVE TENDERED THIS OFFER AS A MEANS OF EXPLOITING YOUR AGE. THAT'S NOT TRUE. THEY WERE TOTALLY UP-FRONT ABOUT THAT. - AND THAT MAKES IT BETTER? - I KNOW WHAT I'M GETTING MYSELF INTO. I'M NOT SURE YOU DO. LOOK. THIS CHOICE IS YOURS TO MAKE. IT IS NOT LEGITIMATELY A PARENTAL DECISION. BUT, I'D BE LYING IF I DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT I'D BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF YOU ACCEPTED THEIR OFFER. RIGHT. IN OTHER WORDS, IF I ACCEPT, YOU'LL NEVER FORGIVE ME. AND IF I DON'T ACCEPT, I'LL FEEL YOU BULLIED ME. SO I'M DAMNED IF I DO AND DAMNED IF I DON'T. THANKS A LOT. WHAT DID I SAY? DID I SAY NO? I DIDN'T SAY NO. TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I FIND A LOT OF VALIDITY IN WHAT HE WAS SAYING. WHAT WOULD BE SO TERRIBLE ABOUT DOOGIE GOING INTO PRIVATE PRACTICE? FOR ONE THING, HE HAS A COMMITMENT TO EASTMAN. HE'S ALSO OVERWORKED, OVERSTRESSED AND EXHAUSTED ALL THE TIME. HE'S 16 YEARS OLD, AND HE'S BURNING OUT. MY GOD, DAVID. WHEN HE TOLD US ABOUT BEING HELD AT KNIFE POINT, I HAD TO FIGHT OFF EVERY IMPULSE TO STOP HIM FROM GOING BACK THERE. ALL RIGHT, I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK HIS ARM, BUT I FEEL WHAT I FEEL. I'LL TALK WITH HIM. DOOGIE? SON? - BRANDON? - Child: HERE! HERE! HERE! HERE! BRANDON TARTIKOFF? AIR CONDITIONING. - HI, KELLY. - NO, I'M KATIE. OH. I'M HERE TO SEE DOCTORS BRADY AND PRICE. ARE YOU A NEW PATIENT? ACTUALLY, I'M DOCTOR HOWSER. OH, RIGHT, I'M SORRY. FOLLOW ME. DR. HOWSER, WELCOME. - SEE YOU LATER. - BYE. I SEE YOU MET KATIE. - HOW DO YOU LIKE OUR PLACE? - IT'S GREAT. - BYE, TIFFANY. HELLO, DOCTOR. - BYE. - GETTING THE TOUR? - YEAH. LET'S SEE. WE HAVE EIGHT EXAMINATION ROOMS. LAB, X-RAY, NEO-NATAL, AND, OF COURSE, YOUR OWN OFFICE. NOT A BAD WAY TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. KELLY? DOCTOR, THE IGER BOY IS REFUSING TO TAKE HIS ALLERGY SHOT AGAIN. - Boy: NO, I DON'T WANT A SHOT. - COME ON. - YOU CAN DO IT. - NO. - UH, I'M SORRY. - IT'S OKAY. - DO YOU MIND? - NO, GO RIGHT AHEAD. WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT'S GOING ON HERE? IT'S ALL RIGHT, MRS. IGER. THIS IS OUR COLLEAGUE DR. HOWSER. HI, I'M DR. HOWSER. MY FRIENDS CALL ME DOOGIE. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - BOBBY. BOBBY, I THINK YOU LOST THIS. Mrs. Iger: OOH. HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED A VIDEO GAME CALLED ZELDA, BOBBY? YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GET TO THE FINAL DOOR AND THE PRINCESS IS RIGHT INSIDE, BUT ALL YOU HAVE LEFT IS YOUR SILVER ARROW? - YEAH. - YOU'RE A LITTLE AFRAID, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO DECIDE. DO YOU GO BACK AND GET MORE HEARTS OR DO YOU GO FORWARD - WITH JUST YOUR SILVER ARROW? - YOU GO FORWARD. - YOU GOTTA WIN THE PRINCESS. - THAT'S RIGHT. WELL, THIS IS YOUR SILVER ARROW, BOBBY. NOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO WIN THE PRINCESS, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS SHOT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO? TAKE THE SHOT. ALL RIGHT. JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES. THAT'S IT. YOU DID IT. BOBBY, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU. - THANK YOU. - WILL YOU BE HERE NEXT TIME? I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE. DOOGIE, I HAVE ONE PIECE OF ADVICE: REAL ESTATE. MY BROTHER JUST MADE A KILLING ON HIS CONDO IN SANTA MONICA. SLOW DOWN. HE HASN'T EVEN TAKEN THE JOB YET. SAVE IT, McGUIRE. WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. - YOU WENT OUT WITH HER. - YEAH, I TOOK HER TO DINNER. - IT WAS NICE. - OH RIGHT. SURE. COME ON. I WAS A PERFECT GENTLEMEN. WHAT? YOU DON'T THINK I CAN HAVE AN HONEST RELATIONSHIP? McGUIRE, YOUR IDEA OF AN HONEST RELATIONSHIP IS SLEEPING WITH THE SAME SPECIES FOR AN ENTIRE WEEKEND. Jack: YOU KNOW, I'M INSULTED. WITH MARIA IT'S DIFFERENT. IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT WE DON'T SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE. I DIDN'T TOUCH HER. OF COURSE, TONIGHT I'M GOING TO TOUCH HER, AND I'M GOING TO LET HER TOUCH ME. YOU ARE A SLIMEBALL, McGUIRE. THAT GUY GETS AWAY WITH MURDER. Dr. Howser, please report to Dr. Canfield's office. UH-OH. COME IN. - YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? - YES. LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THE GONZALES BOY. YES! - I KNEW IT. - CONGRATULATIONS, DOCTOR. WE STARTED HIM ON ACYCLOVIR THIS MORNING. WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH HOW HE RESPONDS TO THE MEDICATION. YOU MAY HAVE JUST SAVED THAT BOY'S LIFE. HOPEFULLY, HE'LL WALK AGAIN. DOUGLAS, YOU'LL HAVE TO FORGIVE OUR SOMETIMES INAPPROPRIATE SKEPTICISM. YOU HAVE ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN THE WORLD IN YOUR GENIUS. BUT FOR US, IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO FORGET YOU'RE JUST A BOY. I'M NOT ASKING FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT, DR. CANFIELD. AND I'M NOT OFFERING ANY, DR. HOWSER. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS WE MAY OCCASIONALLY STEP IN IT, BUT WE HOLD YOU IN VERY HIGH REGARD. THANKS. BY THE WAY, I SPOKE WITH YOUR FATHER. HE TOLD ME YOU'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY THE BRENTWOOD PEDIATRIC GROUP. - HAVE YOU MET WITH THESE PEOPLE? - YEAH, I HAVE. THEN I SUPPOSE YOU'RE CONSIDERING THEIR OFFER. ACTUALLY, I'VE PRETTY MUCH MADE UP MY MIND. I'M GOING TO ACCEPT. UH-HUH. IF I MAY, I'D LIKE TO MAKE ONE OBSERVATION. YOU HAVE A MIND LIKE A SPONGE, DOUGLAS. YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ABSORB MORE IN A WEEK THAN MOST OF US DO IN A YEAR. A MIND LIKE YOURS NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGED. EASTMAN MAY NOT BE THE MOST LUXURIOUS PLACE TO WORK, BUT I GUARANTEE YOU THE QUALITY AND COMPLEXITY OF WHAT YOU'LL LEARN HERE CANNOT BE MATCHED. IT'S HIGHLY UNLIKELY YOU'LL COME ACROSS A HECTOR GONZALES AT THE BRENTWOOD PEDIATRIC GROUP. SO YOU'RE REALLY LEAVING, HUH? WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU AROUND HERE. YOU STILL NOT TALKING TO ME? HEY SPORT, LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, IT'S MY DUTY TO GO OUT WITH MARIA. IT'S LIKE A HANGING CURVE BALL. YOU GOTTA GO DEEP. HE IS. - WHAT? WHAT? - WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE. DEAD? WHAT'S THIS ABOUT DEAD? HE'S MARIA'S FIANCE. HE SAID YOU SOILED HER. YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE. WE'RE JUST AMIGOS. DOOGIE, TELL HIM. WHAT DID HE SAY? BAD NEWS, JACK. HE WANTS TO CUT OUT YOUR HEART. PLEASE, MAN! DON'T HURT ME! I NEVER TOUCHED HER. I SWEAR. I'M INNOCENT! FOR GOD'S SAKE, I'M A DOCTOR! HEY, JACK, MEET TONY. HE'S A NEW ORDERLY UPSTAIRS. NICE TO MEET YOU, JACK. - EXCELLENT. - "FOR GOD'S SAKE, I'M A DOCTOR!" - MR. GONZALES, YOU WANTED TO SEE ME? - NO. HMM. SOMEBODY BEEPED ME. MR. GONZALES, DR. HOWSER, COULD YOU ALL FOLLOW ME PLEASE? WAIT. YOU SET THIS UP, DIDN'T YOU? Canfield: WHO? ME? IT'S PRETTY MANIPULATIVE. ALL RIGHT, LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU PASSED UP $100,000 PLUS SIX MONTHS VACATION AND A BEACH HOUSE WITH TWINS? - YEAH. - YOU'RE SICKER THAN I THOUGHT, HOWSER. - I MEAN, TWINS. - SOME THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT, VINNY. - LIKE WHAT? - LIKE HELPING PEOPLE THAT REALLY NEED HELP. - I BET. - MY DAD WAS RIGHT. MONEY'S NOT EVERYTHING. SINCE WHEN HAVE YOU LISTENED TO YOUR OLD MAN? HE'S NOT ALWAYS A REKNOB. OH! OH! - IS DOOGIE HOME? - YEAH. AND GUESS WHAT, DEAR? I AM NOT ALWAYS A REKNOB. CONGRATULATIONS, DAVID. CATHERINE, WHAT'S A REKNOB? YOU SURE I CAN'T CHANGE YOUR MIND? - I'M SURE, VIN. - IT'S YOUR LIFE. YOU WANT TO MISS OUT ON THE FINER THINGS, BE MY GUEST. I'M OUT OF HERE. GOOD NIGHT, VINNY. TWINS. I'M NEVER GONNA SLEEP TONIGHT. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
