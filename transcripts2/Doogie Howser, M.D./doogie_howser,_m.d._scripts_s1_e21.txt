 - CAN I READ IT? - MM! IT WOULD BE AN HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE. - WELL? - IT'S TERRIFIC, DAD. THE RESEARCH IS VERY COMPREHENSIVE. IT REALLY SUPPORTS YOUR THEORIES. THERE'S JUST ONE THING. JUNE, JUNE, JUNE... HERE IT IS. JUNE, 1987. LET'S SEE, I THINK IT WAS PAGE 146. - "THE NEW JERSEY HEALTH NEWS." - THE WHAT? THIS IS EXACTLY MY STUDY. ACTUALLY, HE RESEARCHED IMPOTENCY... IN MALES OF ALL AGES. WELL, I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. IN HERE, MY... STUDY WOULD BE REDUCED TO A MERE FOOTNOTE. WELL, HE HAD A RICH RESEARCH GRANT BEHIND HIM. AT LEAST HE VALIDATED YOUR WORK. NICE TRY, SON. I REMEMBER IT LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY. 1962. A 20-HOUR BUS RIDE FROM MEXICO CITY. 18-HOUR DAYS, NO ELECTRICITY. CLEAN WATER? HUMPH... NOT A CHANCE. - Curly: SOUNDS AWFUL. - AWFUL? IT WAS GREAT! SIGN UP FOR THIS PROGRAM AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT MEDICINE IS ALL ABOUT: CLUB FEET, LEPROSY, GANGRENE. DIDN'T DR. GILBERT COME BACK FROM THERE WITH THAT LINGERING SIX-MONTH SLEEPING SICKNESS? THAT'S THE EXCITING PART OF THIS: EXPERIENCING HARDCORE COMBAT-LIKE MEDICINE. IF I'M TAKING A TRIP TO MEXICO, IT'S GONNA BE THE BEACH. THE POINT IS TO GO TO THE POOR, RURAL AREAS AND EAT, DRINK, AND SLEEP MEDICINE FOR TWO WEEKS. HOW OFTEN ARE ANY OF YOU GONNA SEE A FOUR-FOOT TAPEWORM? I PULLED TWO OUT OF A TEENAGE BOY. - UGH. Code Blue, emergency room. - Code Blue, Emergency room. - Nurse: WE HAVE NO PULSE. Doogie: LET'S GET AN AIRWAY IN AND PUT IN ANOTHER LINE. HE'D BEEN HIT IN THE HEART. LOOKS LIKE A TAMPONADE. - I'M OPENING HIM UP. - THERE'S STILL NO PULSE. HE'LL GUSH. LET'S MOVE HIM TO THE O.R. THERE'S NO TIME. I HAVE TO OPEN HIM UP HERE. SCALPEL. - RETRACTION. - Jack: RETRACTOR. Nurse: RIGHT HERE. CLAMP. THERE'S TOO MUCH BLOOD. LET'S GET SOME SUCTION IN HERE, STAT. - WHERE'S THE BASIN? - BASIN'S HERE. - IT'S OUT. - Doogie: WHEW. - CAN YOU GET CONTROL? - YEAH. I'VE PLUGGED IT WITH MY FINGER. I'M MASSAGING THE HEART. - HOW'S HIS PRESSURE? - Curly: WE'VE GOT A PULSE. - PRESSURE'S 8O OVER 40 AND COMING UP. - GREAT WORK, DOOG. ALERT O.R. TELL 'EM WE'RE COMING IN. WE GOT TO MOVE HIM. LET'S GO. WE'RE MOVING. Medic: WATCH THAT CABLE. - WHOA. - OW! HELLO, DOUGLAS. OH HI, DOOGIE. HI, MRS. LEONARD. YOU OKAY? OKAY? I'M ALIVE THANKS TO YOUR FATHER. I WAS TENDING MY CHAMPION ROSES WHEN A YELLOWJACKET UP AND STUNG ME... RIGHT IN THE RUMP. AND THIS WONDERFUL MAN OF MEDICINE PERFORMED AN EMERGENCY SURGERY. GREAT! ALL IN A DAY'S WORK. HOW WAS YOUR DAY? OH, NOTHING SPECIAL. JUST THE SAME OLD JUNK. THESE ARE FOR A "DR. HOWSER." - WHAT A NICE SURPRISE. - Mrs. Leonard: BEAUTIFUL. I WONDER WHO THESE ARE FROM. "DR. HOWSER, I WANTED TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR MY HUSBAND. PULLING THAT BULLET FROM HIS HEART AND PUMPING LIFE BACK INTO HIS BODY WAS TRULY A MIRACLE. Courier: WOW, A REAL HERO-TYPE DUDE, HUH? David: THANK YOU. THANKS, GOOD DOCTOR. AND I THOUGHT MY LITTLE BUG-BITE WAS IMPORTANT. THESE ARE FOR YOU. David: I WONDER WHAT MIRACLE I MAY HAVE TO PERFORM NEXT. POISON IVY? HANGNAIL? DAD, I GET ACCIDENT VICTIMS EVERY DAY THAT REQUIRE NO MORE THAN A BAND-AID. THANK YOU, SON, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO COMPARE NOTES WITH ME. YOU PERFORM MEANINGFUL LIFESAVING MEDICINE ON A DAILY BASIS. I DON'T. DAVID, YOU'VE BEEN MOPING ABOUT YOUR RESEARCH STUDY FOR THREE DAYS. SORRY, DEAR, BUT I PUT SIX YEARS OF MY LIFE INTO THAT THING. HOW WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT WAS ALREADY PUBLISHED? YEAH, AND IT WAS IN A TOTALLY OBSCURE MEDICAL JOURNAL. I MEAN, WHO READS "THE NEW JERSEY HEALTH NEWS"? YOU DO... AND I SHOULD HAVE. OBSCURE OR NOT, I DIDN'T DO MY HOMEWORK. SO DO ANOTHER STUDY. I'M TAPPED OUT. AT MY AGE, YOU DON'T COME UP WITH NEW STUDIES. NO, WE'LL DO ONE TOGETHER. LET'S COME UP WITH AN IDEA. THANK YOU FOR BEING SO CHARITABLE, SON. YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE TWO DOZEN PAPERS PUBLISHED BY THE TIME YOU HIT 30. YOU DON'T NEED ME HOLDING YOU BACK. IT WAS A WONDERFUL DINNER, KATHERINE. I THINK I'LL RETIRE FOR THE EVENING. A YEAR AGO, I COULD DO TWO SETS OF THESE. A YEAR AGO, I DIDN'T HAVE HAIR GROWING IN MY EARS. YOU TOO. RECENTLY, I'VE BEEN A LITTLE BORED WITH WORK. GOING TO THE OFFICE HAS BECOME A STRUGGLE. AT LEAST YOU GET TO PRACTICE MEDICINE. I SPECIALIZE... IN MEMO WRITING AND BUDGET ALLOCATION MEETINGS. WAS THE HUMAN BODY MEANT TO DO THIS? YES... BUT OUR BODIES HAVEN'T BEEN HUMAN FOR 20-30 YEARS. THE EXERCISE BIKE'S PRETTY SAFE. GOOD IDEA. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ALL THOSE BIG DREAMS WE HAD? I GUESS WE REALIZED SOME. AND THE OTHERS... WELL, THEY STILL MAKE PRETTY GOOD DREAMS. HOW COME IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU? IT DOES... BUT THIS IS WHAT I AM. I MAKE THE BEST OF IT. VERY FEW OF US CAN BE STARS. I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PEDALING. WHY RUIN A COMFORTABLE SEAT? David: I THINK I NEED A NAP. - Doogie: WOW, THOSE ARE NICE. - MMM. I THOUGHT WE COULD USE A LITTLE CHEER AROUND THIS HOUSE. YOUR FATHER'S ON HIS FOURTH DAY IN A ROW. THE GIRLS IN THE OFFICE ARE ASKING QUESTIONS. HE'S JUST TAKING SOME TIME. I'M SURE HE'LL BE BACK TO WORK ON MONDAY. GLORIOUS DAY. - HI, HONEY. - HI. WHAT'D YOU DO? I DROVE UP THE COAST HIGHWAY. STOPPED AT A LITTLE SEAFOOD PLACE AND HAD A BOWL OF CLAM CHOWDER AND WATCHED THE WAVES. - IT WAS DELIGHTFUL. - SOUNDS NICE. IT GAVE ME A LITTLE TIME TO THINK. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN IN A MOOD THE PAST FEW DAYS AND... IT'S HIGH TIME I DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I'M GONNA SELL MY PRACTICE AND RETIRE. WHAT?! WHERE WAS I WHEN THIS WAS DECIDED? IT'LL WORK OUT FINE. WE HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY AND THE SALE OF THE PRACTICE WILL ONLY ENHANCE OUR POSITION. OUR LIFESTYLE WILL NOT CHANGE. FORGET THE MONEY. WHAT ABOUT MEDICINE? - IT'S YOUR LIFE! - WAS MY LIFE. NOW, WE'LL LEAVE THE MEDICINE TO THE REAL DOCTOR IN THIS FAMILY. AND WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING? WELL, YOU KNOW, THINGS. GOLF, FISHING, OR THIS... MY NEW TOOLBOX. THERE'RE A LOT OF PROJECTS THAT I PLAN ON TACKLING AROUND HERE. - I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. - IT'LL ALL WORK OUT. TRUST ME. I'M GONNA GO OUT IN THE GARAGE... AND SET UP OUR WORKSHOP. THIS IS NOT HAPPENING. DOOGIE, ANSWER THIS FOR ME. HAS HE FLIPPED? NO, I STILL THINK HE'S IN A MOOD. IT'S GOTTEN MORE INTENSE, BUT I BELIEVE IT'S TEMPORARY. CAN YOU IMAGINE HIM AROUND THIS HOUSE EVERY DAY, SAWING AND BANGING AWAY? THAT THOUGHT IS FRIGHTENING. WELL THEN, WHAT DO WE DO? IS THERE SOME SORT OF THERAPY? MAYBE A DRUG? WELL, IF I WERE DAD'S PHYSICIAN, I'D TAKE SOME BLOOD TESTS IN ORDER TO RULE OUT AN ORGANIC DEPRESSION. AFTER THOSE PRECAUTIONS, I THINK WE COULD NARROW IT DOWN TO A FUNCTIONAL DEPRESSION, IN WHICH CASE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PSYCHOTHERAPY AND MAYBE BIOLOGICAL THERAPY IN THE FORM OF ANTI-DEPRESSANTS LIKE TOFRANIL AND PROZAC. BUT IF THAT DOESN'T HELP, WE'LL HAVE TO GO TO A LAST RESORT. E.C.T. E.C.T.? WE'LL ZAP HIM. - SHOCK THERAPY. - DOOGIE! DON'T WORRY, MOM. I'M SURE WE'LL FIND A SIMPLER SOLUTION. I THINK DAD JUST NEEDS AN ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M THROWING ALL THESE OLD MEDICAL JOURNALS OUT. - WHY? - WELL, I'VE MEMORIZED MOST OF THEM. I GOT MY FAVORITE EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL MEMORIZED TOO. - WHICH ONE? - "PLAYBOY." IT'S LIKE WEIRD. I HAVE ALL KINDS OF TROUBLE IN HISTORY CLASS, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT MISS JULY, 1987's FAVORITE PASTIMES ARE SNOW SKIING, RIDING HORSES AND BAKING. IS THERE SOME SORT OF MEDICAL TERM FOR WHAT I GOT? I THINK YOU'D BE DIAGNOSED AS A HORN-DOG. David: OW! THAT'S MY DAD. IF I HADN'T HAVE REMEMBERED THAT ARTICLE, OR IF I JUST KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT, MAYBE NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED. WRONG, DOOG. YOUR DAD'S STUFF STILL WOULD'VE BEEN REJECTED BY THE MAGAZINE THEN HE'D BE EMBARRASSED IN FRONT OF ALL TYPES OF MEDICAL BIG SHOTS. IT'S JUST A BIG MESS. HE'S JUST GIVING UP. LIKE GEORGE BAILEY. - WHO? - GEORGE BAILEY. YOU KNOW, JIMMY STEWART'S CHARACTER IN "IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE?" HE THOUGHT HIS LIFE WAS A WASTE UNTIL THIS ANGEL CAME ALONG AND SHOWED HIM ALL THE GOOD STUFF HE DID FOR OTHER PEOPLE. OH YEAH. I SAW THAT AGAIN LAST CHRISTMAS. VINNIE... YOU'RE A GENIUS. Woman on P.A.: Dr. Peterson, please check your beeper. THANKS. HOW ARE WE FEELING, MR. MOORE? I'M ALIVE. YOU THE WONDER KID THAT SAVED MY LIFE? ACTUALLY, IT WAS NO BIG DEAL. ANY DOCTOR COULD HAVE DONE IT. WHAT A CRAZY WORLD. SOME NUTCASE STICKS A GUN IN MY RIBS, DEMANDS MY HARD-EARNED MONEY... I TOLD HIM HE'D HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST. TECHNICALLY, HE DID. WHAT IS MANKIND COMING TO? CRIMINAL ELEMENT IS EVERYWHERE. WELL, IT'S NOT HERE. JUST REST AND RECOVERY. YOU'RE QUITE A YOUNG MAN. YOU KNOW, IN THE RECOVERY ROOM, I MADE A DECISION. I'M RETIRING. MY LIFE HAS BEEN STAGNANT... BORING. I FIGURE, "WHAT'S THE POINT?" WELL, I DON'T ACCEPT THAT, MR. MOORE. WELL, I DO. SAME OLD JOBS, ONE AFTER ANOTHER. OH... IT BECOMES TIRESOME. WE LIVE IN A YOUNG MAN'S WORLD. THAT'S NOT TRUE. YOU'VE GOT PLENTY OF PRODUCTIVE YEARS. NOW IS THE TIME FOR YOU TO GET OUT THERE AND DO BIGGER, DO BETTER, PASS ON YOUR VALUABLE EXPERIENCE, REACH FOR THE GOLD! YOU THINK? NO ONE'S EVER TAKEN THE TIME TO TALK TO ME... OR CARE ABOUT ME. THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN. HELLO, ARCHIE. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU - IN A COURT OF LAW... - HEY, HEY, HEY. - THIS IS MY PATIENT DAVID MOORE. - ALIAS "ARCHIE AGGLEHOFF." FBI. ARCHIE'S WANTED FOR 16 BANK ROBBERIES IN SEVEN STATES. WELL, SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRODUCTIVE YEARS.

WHEN... - HI, DR. HOWSER. - STANLEY, HOW ARE YOU? AND MRS. W. - HI. - SURPRISE! David: RUTH, ROCKY. AWW, YOU...! - KATHERINE... - DR. HOWSER. - WILLIAM CRAIG. - MARINES. AIRBORNE. YOU RESET MY LEG IN THREE PLACES WHEN I WAS 16. I DON'T THINK I'D BE JUMPING OUT OF PLANES IF YOU DIDN'T. Man: HEY, DOC. - IS THAT CHARLIE WILSON? - HA, IT SURE IS. CHARLIE, HOW ARE YOU? WHEN I GOT THE PHONE CALL FROM YOUR FINE SON AND LOVELY WIFE, I SAID, "AH, THE HECK WITH IT," SO I DROVE ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE FROM BAKERSFIELD. - THANK YOU, CHARLIE. - I WOULDN'T MISS THAT FOR THE WORLD. I BELIEVE IT WAS 1970 AT MY GAS STATION ON WILSHIRE WHEN THAT ENGINE BLEW UP. I HAD THEM BURNING FLUIDS ALL OVER ME. BUT YOU WERE THERE, DOC, FLUSHING MY EYES CLEAN. SAVED MY EYESIGHT, I DO RECALL. WHAT A BLESSING. EXCUSE ME, DOCTOR? DARLENE CUNNINGHAM. AUGUST THE FIFTH, 1979? A FOUR-CAR ACCIDENT ON SUNSET? YES, YES, YES, BUT I DIDN'T OPERATE ON YOU. THE PARAMEDICS GOT A SPECIALIST AT EASTMAN TO PERFORM THE OPERATION. OH, I KNOW. BUT YOU HELD MY HAND FOR THREE HOURS THROUGH IT ALL. GOD BLESS YOU, DR. HOWSER. I NEVER REALIZED. WE ALWAYS HAVE. I... THOUGHT I MIGHT EMULSIFY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE MAN WE HAVE ASSEMBLED TO PAY TRIBUTE. OH NO. DR. HOWSER'S A GREAT GUY, AND FROM THE WAY THIS ROOM SOUNDS, A HELL OF A DOCTOR. HE SAVED A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM A WHOLE MESS OF NASTY STUFF. I SHOULD KNOW. WHEN I WAS SIX, HE PULLED ME FROM A DRAINAGE DITCH. I HAD RIPS AND TEARS EVERYWHERE. BUT THE GOOD DOCTOR SEWN THEM UP. AT 12, PLAYING TOY SOLDIERS, I GOT A HOWITZER STUCK IN MY THROAT! I WAS DOWN TO MY LAST BREATH - TILL THE GOOD DOCTOR DISLODGED IT. - VINNIE, I... HE SAVED MY LIFE SO MANY TIMES. I LOVE THIS MAN. OH... VINNIE. - WHEN I WAS 15, I HAD A RASH... - ♪ FOR... ♪ All: ♪ ...HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ ♪ FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW ♪ ♪ WHICH NOBODY CAN DENY. ♪ YOU KNOW... I NEEDED A SLAP IN THE FACE, AND IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY, YOU AND YOUR MOM DID THAT FOR ME. HEY, IT WAS EASY FINDING PEOPLE YOU HELPED. A LITTLE MORE TIME, WE COULD HAVE FILLED THE FORUM. THANK YOU, SON. OH... I'M GONNA TAKE A TRIP. - FISHING? - NO. BEN CANFIELD AND I ARE GOING TO SPEND TWO WEEKS IN THE HILLS OF ARRIAGA, MEXICO PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED MEDICAL ATTENTION. AND WHEN I RETURN, IT'S BACK TO MY MEDICAL PRACTICE. THAT SOUNDS GREAT, DAD. YEAH, IT DOES. GOOD NIGHT, SON. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
