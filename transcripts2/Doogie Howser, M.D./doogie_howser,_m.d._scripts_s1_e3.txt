HEY, YOU'VE GOT SOME WELL-HUNG TONSILS, LADY. STAY OUT OF MY MEDICAL BAG. THOSE AREN'T TOYS. JUST EXAMINING MY DATE. I WANNA MAKE SURE ALL HER ORAL CAVITIES - ARE IN WORKING ORDER. VINNIE! HEY! HEY, JANINE! HERE WE ARE. ALONE. YEAH, JUST YOU AND ME. BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND. THIS IS REALLY THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. YOU'RE REALLY A GOOD KISSER, DOOGIE. - I AM? - YEAH, YOU'RE REALLY CHARMING. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE REALLY THE FIRST GIRL I EVER KISSED. LIKE THAT. I LIKE IT THAT YOU'RE SHY. I HATE IT WHEN GUYS GET GRABBY AND STUFF. WHAT, DID I BITE YOU? NO, MY STOMACH REALLY HURTS BAD. - WHERE? - HERE. IT'S PROBABLY JUST A CRAMP OR SOMETHING. - RIGHT HERE? - HUH-UH. - OW! - HERE? THAT'S REBOUND TENDERNESS. - LIE BACK AND TAKE DEEP BREATHS. - IT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING I ATE. - I KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT IS. - IF THAT'S IT, YOU ATE YOUR APPENDIX. VINNIE, WE GOTTA GO!

WE GOTTA GET WANDA TO THE HOSPITAL NOW. GET A WHEELCHAIR. 16-YEAR-OLD, PROBABLY APPENDICITIS. - LET'S ADMIT HER, GET SOME BLOOD WORK. - SHE'S A MINOR. WE NEED PARENTAL CONSENT... HER PARENTS ARE UNREACHABLE, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. - PUT HER IN 1-B AND GET SOMEONE TO EXAMINE HER. - EVERYBODY'S TIED UP, DOCTOR... - BAD BUS ACCIDENT. - TRY AND GET A BED ON 6-C AND CALL AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST. START UP AN I.V. WITH DEXTROSE AND SALINE. - CLIMB UP HERE, WANDA. - YOU CAN'T ADMIT HER BY YOURSELF! - YOU NEED THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN'S OKAY! - THIS IS AN EMERGENCY! I CAN ADMIT HER AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'M DOING! IS ANYONE FREE? NO, FOWLER'S IN SURGERY AND EVERYONE ELSE HAS RED BLANKETS. - HOW ARE YOU DOING? - NOT SO GOOD. - 90 OVER 60. - OKAY, THIS MAY BE A LITTLE TIGHT, SO JUST RELAX. LET'S TRY AND GET FOWLER ON THE HORN FOR ME. OKAY, WANDA. THERE'S GONNA BE A LITTLE NEEDLE PRICK HERE, OKAY? OW. I NEED TO TALK TO DR. FOWLER. OKAY, LET'S GET THIS TO THE LAB FOR A C.B.C. LET'S GET A SPECIMEN BOTTLE. WE'RE GONNA NEED A URINALYSIS. I'M COLD. - I'VE GOT DR. FOWLER. - GOOD. LET'S GET A BLANKET. HI. YES, I'M SURE IT'S ACUTE APPENDICITIS. BLOOD PRESSURE'S 90 OVER 60. SHE'S GOT CHILLS. MY GUESS IS SHE'S BECOMING SEPTIC. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO OPERATE RIGHT AWAY. - Maintenance to second floor nurses' station. - NO, I DIDN'T. NO, I DIDN'T. I CAN'T DO THAT. SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND. 16. UH-HUH. UH-HUH. UH-HUH. OKAY. UM... IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GONNA HAVE TO BE THE DOCTOR HERE, WHICH MEANS I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS. WHAT? ARE YOU PREGNANT? NO. GOOD, VERY GOOD. OKAY. ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE? - DOOGIE! - I'M SORRY, WANDA, I HAVE TO ASK. ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE? NO! OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. WELL, NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT, I HAVE TO DO A PELVIC. NO, PLEASE. WANDA, I'M SORRY, BUT THERE'S NO TIME FOR AN ULTRASOUND. THIS IS THE ONLY OTHER WAY WE CAN TELL IF YOU'VE GOT APPENDICITIS... IN WHICH CASE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE IMMEDIATE SURGERY... OR WHETHER IT'S A RUPTURED OVARIAN CYST, IN WHICH CASE YOU WON'T. I DON'T WANT YOU TO OPERATE ON ME. FOWLER WILL BE DOING THE ACTUAL OPERATION. I'LL JUST BE ASSISTING. I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE THERE. I HAVE TO BE THERE. I'M THE ONLY OTHER SURGEON. WE CAN'T EXACTLY GO SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER DOCTOR AT MIDNIGHT ON A SATURDAY. BESIDES, I'M THE BEST. I KNOW THIS WON'T BE PLEASANT FOR YOU, BUT IT'LL BE MUCH EASIER IF YOU TRY TO RELAX. PLEASE, DOOGIE. HEY, TRUST ME. YOU KNOW I WON'T LET ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU. Dr. Shapiro to the dialysis unit, stat. Fowler: MORE SUCTION. KELLY CLAMP. THERE ARE SOME ADHESIONS HERE. LOOKS LIKE SHE'S HAD IT BEFORE. METZENBAUM. - Nurse: AILEEN, I NEED MORE LAP SPONGES, PLEASE. - Aileen: SURE. Fowler: BABCOCK. OKAY, I'M BRINGING IT UP NOW. EVERYTHING'S GOING GREAT, WANDA. Nurse: DR. FOWLER? - WE HAVE A RED BLANKET, STAB WOUND TO THE HEART. - HAVE YOU DONE THIS BEFORE? - Doogie: YES, BUT... - THEN YOU'RE FINISHING. GET YOUR HANDS ON THAT RETRACTOR, NURSE. DR. HOWSER, TAKE OVER. KELLY. SCALPEL. I KNEW WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE GONE WITHOUT GETTING A PHONE NUMBER TO GIVE HER. ARE YOU SURE HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING? MRS. PLENN, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL. HAVE YOU GOT DAUGHTERS? - NO. - THEN BELIEVE ME, YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE HOW WE'RE FEELING. DOUGLAS IS A FIRST-RATE DOCTOR! MRS. PLENN, WANDA IS IN VERY GOOD HANDS. SHOULDN'T HE BE DONE BY NOW? ONCE THE APPENDIX PERFORATES, IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO IRRIGATE THE AFFECTED AREA. - WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? - SHE'S FINE. THE APPENDIX PERFORATED. WE REMOVED IT. EVERYTHING WENT GREAT. SHE'S GONNA BE PERFECT. - OH, THANK GOD. - HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN? - AND WHY ARE YOU OPERATING? - MICHAEL. HE'S A KID, FOR GOD'S SAKE! THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE GOING TO THE MOVIES. MR. PLENN, APPENDICITIS IS NOT THAT UNCOMMON FOR TEENAGERS. - IT CAN HAPPEN VERY SUDDENLY. - DID ANOTHER DOCTOR LOOK AT HER? DID SOMEBODY ELSE DIAGNOSE THIS? DID YOU OPERATE ALL BY YOURSELF? NO, THE DIAGNOSIS WAS CONFIRMED. DR. FOWLER ALSO PERFORMED THE PROCEDURE. WANDA'S IN RECOVERY. SHE'S AWAKE AND YOU CAN SEE HER IF YOU WANT. THANK YOU, DOOGIE. COME ON, HONEY. YOU OKAY? - TIRED. - COME ON, LET'S GO HOME. - ABDOMEN CLEAN? - YEP. - WHY DIDN'T YOU USE A GENERAL? - TIME. - PLUS SHE'D EATEN A LOT OF STUFF AT THE MOVIES. - HMM. - WHAT'D YOU SEE? - "BATMAN." - AGAIN? - IT'S GOOD, DAD. - YOU OUGHT TO TAKE MOM. - "BATMAN." COME ON, ROBIN. DR. HOWSER. ONCE AGAIN, YOU HAVE MANAGED TO CAUSE AN UPROAR. HOW? - YOU ADMITTED A MINOR PATIENT WITHOUT HER PARENTS' CONSENT. - THERE WAS NO TIME. AND THEN, INSULT TO INJURY, YOU DIDN'T GET THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORIZATION - TO PERFORM EMERGENCY SURGERY. - FOWLER SIGNED IT AND I SIGNED IT. DON'T KID A KIDDER, YOUNG MAN. YOU BOTH DID THE SURGERY. YOU NEEDED TWO OTHER SIGNATURES. IT WAS AN EMERGENCY. THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE THERE. - IF ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG... - IT DIDN'T. IF IT HAD... THINGS DO! WE COULD HAVE BEEN SUED FOR MILLIONS. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT IN AN EMERGENCY I SHOULD SIT ON MY HANDS, MAYBE RISK A PATIENT'S LIFE, JUST TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF A LAWSUIT? THIS WASN'T JUST ANY PATIENT. - THIS WAS YOUR GIRLFRIEND. - HER PARENTS WERE UNREACHABLE. THERE WERE NO OTHER SURGEONS AVAILABLE. UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES I'D DO IT AGAIN! DR. CANFIELD, WHAT'S THE DEAL AROUND HERE? ARE WE A BUNCH OF NERVOUS BUREAUCRATS OR ARE WE DOCTORS? LIKE IT OR NOT, DOUGLAS, AND NONE OF US DO, PRACTICING MEDICINE IN 1989 REQUIRES US TO BE BOTH. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THIS HOSPITAL PAYS OUT IN LEGAL FEES AND MALPRACTICE CLAIMS? NO, SIR. OVER $1,000,000 ANNUALLY... UNFORTUNATELY. AND IT'S NOT ONLY MY JOB TO TEACH YOU ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, BUT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF PRACTICING MEDICINE. DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER? YES, SIR. GO ON. BEAT IT. GO GIVE SOMEONE ELSE A HARD TIME. HI! HOW'S THE PATIENT? - OKAY. - ANY PAIN? - NOT MUCH. - GOOD. - UH, I NEED TO CHECK YOUR DRESSING. - DON'T. I HAVE TO. SEND SOMEBODY ELSE TO DO IT. WANDA, WHAT'S THE MATTER? I HATE IT THAT YOU EXAMINED ME THE WAY YOU DID... THAT YOU SAW ME THAT WAY. HEY, I WASN'T CRAZY ABOUT IT EITHER. BUT I HAD NO CHOICE. BESIDES, I'VE SEEN A MILLION PATIENTS. YOU NEVER SAW ME. WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? DROP YOU OFF AT THE HOSPITAL AND GO HOME? JUST GO AWAY. I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU ANYMORE. WANDA, I... Recreational therapist to outpatient therapy. Recreational therapist to outpatient therapy. YOU LOOK LIKE YOUR BEST FRIEND DIED. WORSE. FIRST CANFIELD READS ME THE RIOT ACT FOR ADMITTING WANDA INTO EMERGENCY, THEN WANDA TELLS ME SHE NEVER WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN. WHY? SHE SAYS IT'S TOO EMBARRASSING. DOOGIE HAD TO DIAGNOSE HER APPENDICITIS. YOU MEAN SHE'S NEVER BEEN CHECKED OUT BY A DOCTOR OF THE OPPOSITE SEX? I GUESS NOT ON A SECOND DATE, NO. EXCUSE ME, MR. SENSITIVE. - DR. SENSITIVE. - Curly: WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE GIVEN A PERSONAL, INTIMATE EXAMINATION BY A DOCTOR OF THE OPPOSITE SEX? ARE YOU KIDDING? GIVE HER A LITTLE TIME, SPORT. SHE'LL GET OVER IT. GOTTA FLY. SEE YOU GUYS. BOY... WOMEN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THEM AT ALL. Dr. Charlotte to emergency. HI, HOW ARE YOU FEELING? OKAY, I GUESS. I SEE DR. HOWSER DID YOUR SURGERY. - UH-HUH. - NOT TOO MANY GIRLS CAN BRAG THAT THEY'VE HAD THEIR APPENDIX REMOVED BY A 16-YEAR-OLD DOCTOR. THAT'S THE MOST HUMILIATING THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME. WHY? HE SAVED YOUR LIFE. HE WAS ALSO MY BOYFRIEND. AH. EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT WHAT HE DID... IT WAS JUST SO INTIMATE. YOU KNOW, I'VE ASSISTED IN LOTS OF SURGERIES, AND WHEN A DOCTOR'S OPERATING, HE HAS TO DETACH HIMSELF FROM HIS FEELINGS. THAT'S ESPECIALLY HARD TO DO WHEN THE DOCTOR CARES AS MUCH ABOUT THE PATIENT AS... I KNOW DOOGIE DOES ABOUT YOU. I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, WANDA, BUT I THINK YOU'RE CONFUSING EMBARRASSMENT WITH ANGER. I ALSO THINK YOU'RE PRETTY LUCKY TO HAVE DOOGIE FOR A BOYFRIEND. HOWSER, YOU STUD! - DID YOU BRING IT HOME? - BRING WHAT HOME? HER APPENDIX, PEA-BRAIN! YOU KNOW THAT SHAKESPEARE THING. "ALAS, POOR YORICK, I KNEW HIM WELL." YOU COULD LIKE, TALK TO HER APPENDIX IN A JAR, SAME THING. - I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. - COME ON, - TELL UNCLE VINNIE ALL ABOUT IT. - THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL. OH, EXCUSE ME. SEEING WANDA PLENN TOTALLY NAKED, HAVING YOUR HANDS ALL OVER HER, EYEBALLING HER INTERNALS, THAT'S NOTHING?! LOOK, I DIDN'T SEE HER TOTALLY NAKED. I DIDN'T HAVE MY HANDS ALL OVER HER. I REMOVED HER APPENDIX, THAT'S ALL. - HOW'D YOU FIND OUT ANYWAY? - WANDA'S PARENTS TOLD RITCHIE FOGLE'S PARENTS. FOGLE TOLD ME. HOWSER, YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST GUY IN THE WORLD! - THIS IS A SEX PERVERT'S DREAM COME TRUE! - RIGHT. "EXCUSE ME, WANDA, I JUST YANKED YOUR APPENDIX. SHOULD WE CLOSE UP OR DO YOU JUST WANNA NECK?" TRUST ME, VINNIE, YOU'RE OPENING AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. YOU'RE EXPOSING DISEASED INTERNAL ORGANS. THERE'S NOTHING SEXY ABOUT IT. WOULD YOU GET OUTTA HERE? I GOTTA EAT DINNER AND GO BACK TO THE HOSPITAL. COULD YOU TELL ME ONE THING? DID YOU HAVE TO SHAVE HER? I MEAN IT! GET OUTTA HERE! OKAY! OKAY! IT'S LIKE I'M BEING PUNISHED FOR SOMETHING THAT ISN'T MY FAULT. IT'S NOT FAIR. THIS ISN'T ABOUT FAIR, IT'S ABOUT FEELINGS. WHAT ABOUT MY FEELINGS? DOOGIE... FOR ANY WOMAN, LET ALONE A 16-YEAR-OLD, HAVING A PELVIC EXAMINATION CAN BE... A HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE. IT ROBS YOU OF YOUR DIGNITY... OF CONTROL OVER YOUR OWN BODY. INTELLECTUALLY YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DO BUT, EMOTIONALLY, IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET PAST THE FEELING THAT... WELL, THAT YOU'VE BEEN VIOLATED. YEAH, BUT SHE SAID SHE NEVER WANTS TO SEE ME AGAIN. OH, I DOUBT SHE MEANT THAT. WELL, SHE SAID IT. PEOPLE SAY LOTS OF THINGS WHEN THEY'RE UPSET. SO WHAT DO I DO IN THE MEANTIME? BACK OFF. GIVE IT SOME TIME. LET HER COME TO YOU. HI. HOW YA FEELING? - BETTER. - IS THAT A PATIENT SPEAKING OR A GIRL SPEAKING? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? WELL, IF IT'S A PATIENT SPEAKING, I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO BILL YOU 40 BUCKS. - DOOGIE? - WANDA? YOU GO FIRST. ABOUT THE STUFF I SAID... ABOUT NOT EVER WANTING TO SEE YOU AGAIN? I DIDN'T MEAN IT. I WAS JUST... YOU KNOW, EMBARRASSED. HEY, IT'S OKAY. - I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY. FORGET ABOUT IT. - I MEAN, IT HAD TO BE PRETTY EMBARRASSING FOR YOU TOO, HUH? YEAH, WELL... I GUESS IT WAS, SORT OF. CAN I ASK YOU ONE THING THOUGH? SURE. DID YOU... YOU KNOW, SEE ME NAKED? - GEE, WANDA. - DID YOU? WELL, NOT REALLY. JUST FROM... HERE TO HERE. - OH MY GOD. - BUT I DIDN'T PAY MUCH ATTENTION, I SWEAR. NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT GREAT. YOU'RE GREAT! IT'S JUST THAT... WELL, I WAS... TOO BUSY TRYING TO BE A DOCTOR. COME HERE. THANKS FOR TAKING CARE OF ME, DOOGIE. HEY... NO BIG DEAL. IT'S GETTING KIND OF LATE, SON. I KNOW, I'M ALMOST DONE. IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT WITH YOU AND WANDA? I GUESS. UNLESS SHE CHANGES HER MIND AGAIN. UH, PERMIT A... A LITTLE WISDOM FROM YOUR OLD MAN. NO MATTER HOW PRODIGIOUS YOUR INTELLECT, THE CONUNDRUM OF WOMANHOOD IS... SELDOM GRASPED AND NEVER FULLY UNDERSTOOD. DR. HOWSER? WHAT'S THIS STUFF ABOUT GRASPING WANDA'S CONUNDRUM? VINCENT, ISN'T IT PAST YOUR BEDTIME? NO, SIR. HMM. WELL IT'S PAST MINE. GOOD NIGHT, SON. - GOOD NIGHT, DAD. - NIGHT, DR. HOWSER! VINCENT. HOWSER, YOU SCHNAUZER. YOU NEVER TOLD ME YOU GRABBED HER CONUNDRUM! WELL, I DON'T TELL YOU A LOT OF THINGS. AND?! AND WHAT? WAS IT... YOU KNOW, GOOD? IT WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS. NOW WOULD YOU GET OUTTA HERE? I GOTTA GO TO BED. OKAY, OKAY. OH, DR. HOWSER, I LOVE YOU!
