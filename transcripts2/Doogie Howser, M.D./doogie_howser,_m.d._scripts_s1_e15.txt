 Doogie Howser, M.D. (1989–1993): Season 1, Episode 15 - Attack of the Green-Eyed Monster - full transcript 
 Doogie while out with Wanda runs into a former patient, an attractive young girl, who came on to Doogie, at least that's how Wanda saw it. So she puts him in the dog house. Doogie talks to his mom about it and says that it's normal for people to flirt with other people. She says some men have flirted with her, which her husband overhears and is upset. And she doesn't think it's a big deal.

 Sometimes I know exactly what you're going to say... most of the time. The other times... the other times, you're just a stinker. - What did you do that for? - I've been wondering whether I'd like it. - What's the decision? - I don't know yet.

This belongs to me and so do my lips. - I don't see any difference. - Oh, I do. Okay. You know you don't have to act with me, Steve.

 You don't have to say anything and you don't have to do anything. Not a thing. Oh, maybe just whistle. You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and... blow. I DON'T SEE WHAT THE FASCINATION IS WITH BOGART. I MEAN, HE IS NO MEL GIBSON. IT WAS ALL IN HIS ATTITUDE, JANINE. HE WAS A TOUGH GUY WITH A HEART OF GOLD. - WOMEN LOVED HIM. - YEAH, BUT HE DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE ABOUT ANY OF THEM. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE HE WAS TOO COOL TO SHOW HOW HE FELT. THAT'S THE POINT. THE MORE HE ACTED LIKE HE DIDN'T CARE, THE MORE DAMES FELL AT HIS FEET. - DAMES, VINNIE? - YEAH.

 LAUREN BACALL WAS A DAME. MARY ASTOR WAS A DAME. SUZY BERLUTTI IS A DAME. YOU KNOW, IF I HEAR THE WORD SUZY OR BERLUTTI FROM YOU ONE MORE TIME... WHY, JANINE, I NEVER KNEW YOU CARED. Girl: DOOGIE? CHRISTA?! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S YOU! - I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S YOU EITHER. - GOSH, LOOK HOW TALL YOU GOT! - YOU LOOK GREAT! - THANKS, HOW'S YOUR KNEE? PHYSICAL THERAPY WAS REALLY TOUGH, BUT YOU WERE RIGHT. I'VE GOT FULL MOVEMENT BACK. YOU DID A WONDERFUL JOB, DOCTOR. YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE THE SCAR. - YEAH, THAT'S TERRIFIC. - IT SURE IS. LOOK, I'M A FRESHMAN AT U.C.L.A. THIS YEAR, AND WE'RE ALWAYS HAVING SORORITY PARTIES. - SO, WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME? - WELL, I... - ARE YOU STILL AT THE HOSPITAL? - YEAH, I AM. GREAT, WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL. OR YOU COULD ALWAYS GIVE ME A WHISTLE. YOU KNOW HOW TO WHISTLE, DON'T YOU? YOU JUST PUT YOUR LIPS TOGETHER AND BLOW. WHAT? - YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT? - NO. I MEAN, I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW WOMEN CAN MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF NOTHING. ALL I DID WAS TRY TO BE POLITE. THE NEXT THING I KNOW, WANDA'S HYSTERICAL. SHE WAS JUST AN OLD PATIENT. I MEAN, IS NOT INTRODUCING SOMEONE GROUNDS FOR NOT SPEAKING TO THEM FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING? DOOGIE, I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU, BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. OH, SORRY. ALL RIGHT, THE MOVIE HAD JUST ENDED. WE WERE ALL COMING OUT OF THE THEATER, IT WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT. DR. HOWSER? OH, HI, MISS... MISS...? BENSON. IT'S A PLEASURE SEEING YOU AGAIN, DOCTOR. THE NEXT THING I KNOW, WANDA'S GIVING ME THE SILENT TREATMENT. WELL, IT SOUNDS FAIRLY TAME TO ME. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT YOU FELT NO ATTRACTION TO THIS GIRL. HARDLY ANY. YOU KNOW, DOOGIE, WE ALL GET FLIRTED WITH NOW AND THEN. IT MAKES US FEEL GOOD ABOUT OURSELVES. ATTRACTIVE. IT'S A PERFECTLY NATURAL REACTION. WHAT? I'LL TELL YOU A LITTLE SECRET I HAVEN'T EVEN TOLD YOUR FATHER. WE WERE AT A PARTY NEW YEAR'S EVE AND YOUR FATHER WAS OFF TALKING WITH SOME FRIENDS, WHEN ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES, NOT TOO SUBTLY, MADE A PASS AT ME. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. I DIDN'T ENCOURAGE IT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DIDN'T DISCOURAGE IT. AND OF COURSE NOTHING HAPPENED. BUT I WAS FLATTERED. IT WAS KIND OF... EXCITING. AND YOU MAY HAVE REACTED THE SAME WAY AND THAT'S WHAT WANDA PICKED UP ON. Howser: ALAN WALLACE. AM I RIGHT? IT WAS ALAN WALLACE. NO, DAVID, IT WASN'T ALAN WALLACE. MARK SCHWARTZ. WRONG. STEVE GOODMAN. STEVEN GOODMAN. THE MAN'S A CHIROPRACTOR, FOR GOD'S SAKES. OH PLEASE, DAVID, DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF THIS. WHO'S MAKING A BIG DEAL? YOU'RE THE ONE WHO FELT THE NEED TO KEEP THIS A SECRET. THIS IS EXACTLY THE REASON WHY I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING. - I KNEW YOU'D OVERREACT. - OVERREACT? WELL, EXCUSE ME IF I'M A TAD UPSET THAT MY WIFE IS PAWED AT A PARTY AND DOESN'T BOTHER TO TELL ME. THAT IS NOT WHAT HAPPENED! GEE, LOOK AT THE TIME. I... I GOTTA GO. DAVID, THE MAN MADE A PASS AT ME. AND YES, I WAS FLATTERED. AND MAYBE IT WOULDN'T HAVE MEANT ANYTHING IF YOU'D SHOWED EVEN A PASSING INTEREST IN ME LATELY. DO YOU KNOW I SPENT TWO WEEKS LOOKING FOR THE PERFECT DRESS FOR THAT EVENING? TOTAL STRANGERS SAID I LOOKED FANTASTIC, AND YET MY OWN HUSBAND NEVER SAID A WORD. OH NO, OH NO. DON'T TRY TO MAKE THIS MY FAULT. I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DO THAT. THIS ISN'T A QUESTION OF FAULT. IT'S A QUESTION OF FEELING APPRECIATED. WELL, THAT'S NONSENSE. - YOU KNOW YOU'RE APPRECIATED. - DO I? WELL, LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. HOW MANY TIMES SINCE WE'VE BEEN MARRIED HAS A WOMAN MADE A PASS AT YOU? - KATHERINE, PLEASE... - YOU'RE A HANDSOME DOCTOR. YOU CAN'T STAND HERE AND HONESTLY TELL ME A PATIENT NEVER CAME ON TO YOU. WHAT IS YOUR POINT, KATHERINE? MY POINT IS THAT UNLIKE ME, YOU GET VALIDATED. WOMEN LET YOU KNOW YOU'RE SEXY AND ATTRACTIVE ALL THE TIME. WHEN THEY SAY IT, YOU FEEL IT. SO WHEN SOMEONE FLIRTS WITH ME AT A PARTY AND TELLS ME I'M ATTRACTIVE, I FEEL SPECIAL, SOMETHING I RARELY FEEL AROUND HERE ANYMORE! KATHERINE, COME BACK HERE. KATHERINE? WANDA, I THINK... WANDA. HELLO? WANDA, THIS IS CRAZY. OH, GOD. WANDA, CAN'T WE TALK? Girls: MORNING, DOOGIE. MORNING. YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG. - I DON'T CARE ABOUT CHRISTA. - WHO'S CHRISTA? DOOGIE, I'M NOT BLIND. AND I MAY NOT BE AS SMART AS YOU, BUT I SAW WHAT HAPPENED. DOOGIE. - CHRISTA. - I DREAMT ABOUT SEEING YOU AGAIN... DOOGIE MONSTER. YOUR TONGUE WAS PRACTICALLY HANGING ON THE GROUND! DRIVE, JANINE. NO, I'M NOT LETTING YOU GO, WANDA. - MOVE! - NO! YOU ARE BEING RIDICULOUS! WELL, FINE, BUT I'M NOT MOVING UNTIL YOU TALK TO ME. DO YOU REMEMBER HOW ROTTEN YOU FELT WHEN I TOLD YOU I WENT OUT WITH BRIAN JOHNSON? THAT WAS DIFFERENT. YOU TRIED TO MAKE ME JEALOUS. IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT! YOU REALLY HURT MY FEELINGS. WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN TO. SO DO YOU FORGIVE ME? Girls: WE'RE GONNA BE LATE! Girl: I CAN'T BELIEVE... AGAIN! YOU KNOW, WANDA, NO WOMAN IN THE WORLD CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE, NO MATTER HOW PRETTY SHE IS. - NO MATTER HOW PRETTY WHO IS? - HMM? CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT YOU SAID MISS U.C.L.A.'S PRETTIER THAN ME. - THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID! - THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID! AND IF THAT'S HOW YOU FEEL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST RUN OFF TO ONE OF HER STUPID SORORITY PARTIES?! - WANDA, WHAT... - HIT IT, JANINE. IF HE LIES DOWN AGAIN, RUN OVER HIM. Girls: BYE, DR. HOWSER! Fremont: "O, BEWARE, MY LORD, OF JEALOUSY; IT IS THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER WHICH DOTH MOCK THE MEAT IT FEEDS ON." DOUBLE MAJOR, PSYCHOLOGY AND LITERATURE. I COULDN'T SPELL SO HERE I AM. I JUST DON'T GET IT, DR. FREMONT. ONE MINUTE WANDA AND I ARE CRAZY ABOUT EACH OTHER, AND THE NEXT SHE'S SLAMMING THE CAR DOOR IN MY FACE. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT JEALOUSY IS ONE OF OUR MOST POWERFUL EMOTIONS. IT CAN MAKE US FEEL HORRIBLY VULNERABLE AND OUT OF CONTROL. WE EVEN EXPERIENCE A STRONG BIOLOGICAL REACTION. ADRENALINE IS PUMPED INTO OUR BLOOD, OUR BREATHING BECOMES RAPID, OUR MUSCLES CONTRACT... OUR GIRLFRIENDS BECOME TOTALLY IRRATIONAL. WELL, OTHELLO DID KILL DESDEMONA IN A JEALOUS RAGE. BUT I THINK WANDA'S IRRATIONALITY MAY JUST BE HER INABILITY TO PUT INTO WORDS HOW SHE'S REALLY FEELING, THE FEAR THAT SHE'S LOSING SOMEONE SHE CARES A GREAT DEAL ABOUT. BUT SHE'S NOT LOSING ME. WHEN I TRIED TO TELL HER THAT, SHE JUST GOT ANGRIER. ANGER IS ONLY HER WAY OF ATTEMPTING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION. JUST REMEMBER, DR. HOWSER, COMMUNICATING HONESTLY ABOUT ONE'S FEELINGS IS JEALOUSY'S GREATEST FOE. O.R.3, Dr. Gordon you're wanted in O.R.3. MOM, DAD, THIS IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS, DON'T YOU THINK? WELL, IT IS AND WHAT I THINK MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA IS FOR YOU TWO TO TALK TO EACH OTHER. BE HONEST, HONEST ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE REALLY FEELING, JUST LET IT ALL OUT, OKAY? SO WHO'S GONNA GO FIRST? - DAD? - DOUGLAS, MIND YOUR OWN DAMN BUSINESS. DON'T TALK TO MY SON LIKE THAT. YOUR SON? I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM? CERTAINLY NOTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT. WHY DON'T YOU SAVE YOUR RAZOR WIT FOR SOMEONE WHO MIGHT APPRECIATE IT, KATHERINE? LIKE PERHAPS YOUR FRIEND THE CHIROPRACTOR. OH DAVID, PLEASE, YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A CHILD. I'M THE CHILD? WELL, EXCUSE ME, MISS I-NEED-FIREWORKS- ALL-THE-TIME. NOT ALL THE TIME, DAVID. JUST NOT EVERY FOURTH OF JULY. WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY WARMING UP SOMETIME BEFORE JUNE. Howser's voice: THE MAN'S A CHIROPRACTOR, FOR GOD'S SAKES. Christa's voice: YOU KNOW HOW TO WHISTLE, DON'T YOU? YOU JUST PUT YOUR LIPS TOGETHER AND BLOW. Fremont: WELL, OTHELLO DID KILL DESDEMONA IN A JEALOUS RAGE. Wanda's voice: AND IF HE LIES DOWN AGAIN, RUN HIM OVER, RUN HIM OVER... SO YOU THINK YOUR WIFE'S MAKING TIME WITH ANOTHER JOE? I'M SURE OF IT. I FOUND THIS IN HER HANDBAG. "STEVEN GOODMAN, CHIROPRACTOR." MAYBE SHE'S GOT A BAD BACK. YOU GOT ANY PICTURES OF YOUR WIFE? WHAT A DAME! I WOULDN'T MIND GIVING HER AN ADJUSTMENT. I THINK WE CAN HELP YOU OUT. WE'LL BE IN TOUCH. I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT. DOOGIE. WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU, DOLL? I THINK SOMEONE'S FOLLOWING ME. A SHORT ITALIAN GUY? - YEAH. - I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT. DRINK? WHOA, GO EASY ON THAT STUFF, DOLL. NOW WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I CAME TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT'S... IT'S... SORORITY RUSH WEEK. I KNEW IT, YOU LOUSY TWO-TIMER. YOU GOT IT ALL WRONG, SLIM, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. - YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO REASON! - SORRY, DOCTOR. IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE TAKING THE FALL. Call your office. Dr. Buffum, call your office. SO, HOW GOES IT WITH WANDA AND THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER? OH, NOT GREAT. AND YOUR FOLKS, THEY STILL JOUSTING? MORE LIKE BATTLING TO THE DEATH. MY MOM WAS REALLY UPSET THIS MORNING. I'M GONNA GO HOME EARLY AND CHECK UP ON HER. DOUGLAS, KEEP IN MIND THAT JEALOUSY CAN BE KIND OF A HEDGE AGAINST COMPLACENCY - IN A LONG RELATIONSHIP. - HI. A FORM OF LOVE INSURANCE. REMEMBER, WHERE THERE'S JEALOUSY, - THERE'S PASSION. - YEAH. "GIVE ME THE MAN THAT IS NOT PASSION'S SLAVE, AND I WILL WEAR HIM IN MY HEART OF HEARTS AS I DO THEE." SHAKESPEARE. DAMN, THAT GUY WAS GOOD. MOM? MOM? ARE YOU HOME? MOM, ARE YOU... - Howser: DOUGLAS! - OH... SORRY. - HI. - MOM, I AM REALLY... DOOGIE, THERE'S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE. IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE. WE SHOULD HAVE LOCKED THE DOOR. HOW COULD I HAVE MISSED THE FLOWERS? I DON'T GET IT. YOU GUYS WEREN'T EVEN SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER LAST NIGHT. WELL, YOUR FATHER CAME HOME THIS AFTERNOON AND WE TALKED, REALLY TALKED. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE BOTH UNDERSTOOD ONE ANOTHER. I SAW HOW AFRAID HE WAS ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF GETTING OLDER AND LOSING ME TO A YOUNGER MAN. IN A STRANGE WAY, HIS CRAZY JEALOUSY MADE ME REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT I STILL WAS TO HIM. AND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, IT MADE ME FEEL... TERRIFIC. SOMETIMES, JUST THAT LITTLE SPARK CAN DO WONDERS FOR A RELATIONSHIP. YES, IT CAN. DOOGIE. DAD. UH... KATHERINE. DOOGIE... WHY DON'T YOU... RUN OUT AND PLAY? Doogie on P.A.: Wanda Plenn? This is your boyfriend. I know you're in there. And I want you to know just how important you are to me. So, Vinnie... now. ♪ Wild thing ♪ ♪ You make my heart sing ♪ ♪ You make everything groovy ♪ ♪ Wild thing ♪ - ♪ Wild thing, I think I love you... ♪ - OKAY, DOOGIE. ♪ But I wanna know for sure... ♪ - THAT'S ENOUGH. - ♪ Come on and hold me tight ♪ ♪ I love you. ♪ WHAT'S HE DOING? THAT'S ENOUGH! PLEASE! Girl: I REALLY THINK IT'S COOL. Woman: THAT WAS GREAT! ARE YOU CRAZY? YES, I'M TOTALLY INSANE. YOU CAN HAVE ME COMMITTED. I'D DO ANYTHING FOR YOU. SO ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME? I WAS NEVER REALLY MAD. I WAS JUST WORRIED. - ABOUT WHAT? - DOOGIE, YOU LEAD A MUCH MORE GROWN-UP LIFE THAN I DO, AND YOU'RE ALWAYS AROUND ADULTS. SOMETIMES I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA LOSE YOU TO AN OLDER WOMAN. WANDA, I DON'T WANT AN OLDER WOMAN. I WANT YOU. Wanda on P.A.: Oh, Doogie. Doogie: I feel great when I'm with you. I feel great when I just think about you. You're my little Wanda bear. And you're my little Doogie bear. Come here, come here. Doogie, Doogie! Wanda: What was that? Doogie: Hello? Hello? Oh God. Vinnie? Vinnie? Vinnie! - PROMISE, SAY IT. - OKAY, OKAY, I PROMISE NEVER TO REPEAT TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING THAT YOU CALL HER YOUR LITTLE WANDA BEAR. Katherine: BOYS, IT'S LATE! GOOD NIGHT, VINNIE. GOOD NIGHT, MRS. H. I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU ACTUALLY WALKED IN ON THEM. I ONLY GOT ONE QUESTION: WERE THEY UNDER THE SHEETS OR ON TOP OF THE SHEETS? VINNIE, EITHER YOU'RE GOING OUT THAT WINDOW OR YOU'RE GOING OUT THAT WINDOW. GOOD NIGHT, MY LITTLE DOOGIE BEAR!
