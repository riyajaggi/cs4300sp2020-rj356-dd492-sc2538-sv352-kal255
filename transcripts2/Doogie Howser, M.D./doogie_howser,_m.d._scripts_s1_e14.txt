I WAS ANALYZING THE PATTERN OF THE QUESTIONS THEY'VE BEEN ASKING AND I THINK I'VE BROKEN THE SYSTEM. IF I'M RIGHT, TOMORROW THEY SHOULD ASK ABOUT 16th-CENTURY MATH. ARE YOU GONNA READ ALL OF THIS? I COULD RECITE IT. SON, THIS IS ALL SUPPOSED TO BE A LOT OF FUN, NOTHING MORE. YOU KNOW, THE TRUTH IS WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE, IT'S IRRELEVANT. I KNOW, I JUST... - I WANT THAT BOAT. - I WANT THAT CAR. - WIN THAT GAME, SON. - I WILL, DAD. FREEMAN'S SICK! WHICH MEANS I'M ON DUTY TILL 6:00 AND I'VE GOT TO BE AT THE STUDIO BY 3:00.

YOU MAY HAVE THE AFTERNOON OFF. - THANKS FOR BAILING ME OUT. - OF COURSE, DOUGLAS. I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE WAY THEY WERE ALL ACTING. HUMAN NATURE BEING WHAT IT IS, IT WAS PREDICTABLE. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THEM TO DO ANYTHING. WELL, THEY'RE OVERWORKED, EXHAUSTED, IN DESPERATE NEED OF A VACATION. I GUESS I UNDERSTAND THAT. I SUPPOSE IT'S BECAUSE I, TOO, HAVEN'T BEEN ON A VACATION IN SUCH A VERY LONG... LONG TIME. I GUESS WHAT I NEED IS TO GET AWAY SOMEPLACE... TROPICAL. Dr. Bletham, call your office. Dr. Bletham, call your office. SO TELL ME SOMETHING GOOD, SON. Doogie: I WISH I COULD. BUT I JUST FINISHED DISCUSSING YOUR CASE WITH THE OPHTHALMOLOGIST. I'M AFRAID THE TREATMENT ISN'T WORKING. THAT CAN'T BE THE GOOD PART. WE'LL HAVE TO DISCUSS OTHER ALTERNATIVES. LET'S TALK REAL. WHAT ARE MY CHANCES OF SEEING A LITTLE BETTER? THAT'S ALL I WANT. JUST A LITTLE BETTER. I'M AFRAID YOUR VISION WON'T GET ANY BETTER. THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT A DIFFERENT TREATMENT COULD ARREST THE CONDITION. LOOK, I'LL MAKE SURE WE EXHAUST EVERY POSSIBILITY. I NEVER LOST A FIGHT I DIDN'T TRY TO WIN. AND I EVEN LOST A FEW I KNEW I WON. YEAH, CANFIELD SAID THEY CHEATED YOU OUT OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP IN '57. I BELIEVE THEY DID. I COULDN'T HAVE HANDLED THAT. DIDN'T YOU JUST WANT TO KILL SOMEBODY? LIFE IS WHAT IT IS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT I DIDN'T PUT MY FIST THROUGH THE WALL WHEN IT HAPPENED. BUT I KNEW IN MY HEART WHEN I LEFT THAT RING THAT I HAD WON. BUT AFTER THE FAME IS GONE AND THE MONEY, THE ONLY THING YOU'VE GOT, THE ONLY THING THAT COUNTS, IS WHAT YOU KNOW IN YOUR HEART. HMM. Stage manager: ONE MINUTE, EVERYONE. I GUESS THIS IS IT. A BRILLIANT DEDUCTION. OH, I DON'T THINK YOU'RE ALLOWED TO SMOKE IN HERE. I ALWAYS LIKE A CIGARETTE BEFORE A VICTORY. - HEY, I MIGHT WIN. - YEAH, RIGHT. LOOK, KID, I'VE SEEN YOUR SO-CALLED FRIENDS AND EVERY ONE OF THEM HAS GOT THEIR HAND OUT. BY THE TIME THEY'RE FINISHED DIVVYING UP THE SPOILS ALL YOU'RE GONNA SEE OUT OF THIS IS A BIG FAT TAX BILL. AM I RIGHT? WHAT IF YOU WIN? AREN'T YOU GOING TO HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM? - I DON'T HAVE FRIENDS. - 30 SECONDS, PEOPLE, PLACES. LET'S GO, OKAY? TAKE IT FROM ME, KID, PEOPLE SUCK. - Mark: SEAN. - JAMES WATSON AND FRANCIS CRICK. THEY FIRST DISCOVERED THE DOUBLE HELIX OF D.N.A. CORRECT. NOW THE SCORE IS EVEN. FROM THE CATEGORY OF LATIN. WHAT IS THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION FOR ABSILIO? - SEAN? - TO LEAP OR FLY AWAY FROM. CORRECT. AND THAT MEANS, SEAN, YOU'RE IN THE LEAD. THAT BELL MEANS THIS IS OUR LAST QUESTION. SEAN, BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE LEAD YOU WILL HAVE THE FIRST CHANCE. IF YOU ARE CORRECT YOU WILL BE OUR CHAMPION. IF YOU GET IT WRONG DOUGLAS WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO ANSWER IT. I'LL READ A QUESTION FROM THE CATEGORY OF MATHEMATICS. IN 1945 CARDAN PUBLISHED HIS FORMULA FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE CUBIC EQUATION. IN REALITY HE STOLE THIS FORMULA FROM WHAT 16th-CENTURY MATHEMATICIAN? DESCARTES? I'M SORRY. THAT'S INCORRECT. - YES! - Mark: ALL RIGHT, DOUGLAS, IF YOU ANSWER INCORRECTLY SEAN WILL BE OUR CHAMPION. BUT IF YOU ANSWER CORRECTLY YOU WILL WIN THE C.D. PLAYER FOR THE HOUSE AND ONE FOR THE CAR, A DOUBLE STRAND OF FINE PEARLS, A SET OF SKIS, BOOTS, POLES, AND A COMPLETE SKIING WARDROBE, THE WASHER/DRYER, A COMPLETELY NEW KITCHEN, A HAWAIIAN VACATION FOR TWO, A CRUISE AROUND THE WORLD WITH $10,000 SPENDING MONEY, A BRAND NEW B.M.W. CONVERTIBLE AND A BERMUDA 40 SAILING YACHT. DOUGLAS, FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP. IN 1945 CARDAN PUBLISHED HIS FORMULA FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE CUBIC EQUATION. IN REALITY, HE STOLE THIS FORMULA FROM WHAT 16th-CENTURY MATHEMATICIAN? MENDELSOHN. I'M SORRY, THAT'S INCORRECT. THE CORRECT ANSWER IS TARTAGLIA. WHICH MEANS SEAN IS OUR CHAMPION. AND YOU HAVE WON OVER $100,000 IN CASH AND PRIZES. YEAH! CONSOLATION PRIZE. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, SON. BUT YOU KNEW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION, DIDN'T YOU? YEAH. THEN I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHY YOU LOST. I DIDN'T LOSE. SEE, IN MY HEART I KNOW I WON. WHEN EVERYBODY HAD THEIR HAND OUT, I... I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DEAL WITH IT. WELL, I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT BUT I SUPPOSE I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE GREED. IT DOES TERRIBLE THINGS TO YOU. I HATED THE FEELINGS I WAS HAVING. I'M SORRY. I KNOW YOU WANTED THAT BOAT. EHH, WHEN YOU GRADUATED COLLEGE AT 10 AND THEY HAD YOU STAND ON THE PHONE BOOK BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO SHORT FOR THE PODIUM, I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD IMPRESS ME MORE UNTIL NOW. WHY? YOU HAVE HANDLED YOURSELF WITH SUCH RARE DISTINCTION. THAT IS A FAR, FAR BETTER PRIZE THAN ANY BOAT YOU COULD GIVE ME. GOOD NIGHT, SON. GOOD NIGHT. IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL BOAT. - IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL CAR. - OH, YOU HEARD. YOU BLEW $100,000 IN PRIZES AND CASH! VINNIE, WE WERE ALL GETTING GREEDY. GREED IS GOOD. MICHAEL DOUGLAS SAID SO IN "WALL STREET." WELL, IT DIDN'T MAKE ME FEEL SO GOOD. LOOK, I ADMIT I GOT CAUGHT UP IN IT. BUT WHEN YOU WERE WINNING I FELT LIKE A WINNER TOO. THAT WAS NICE. IT WAS, BUT IT WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND. I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT. WE WERE ALL GETTING GREEDY. BUT COULDN'T WE HAVE LAMENTED WITH THE TOP DOWN IN YOUR NEW B.M.W.? VINNIE. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT. AND IF YOU'RE MAN ENOUGH TO FACE THIS, SO AM I. THIS IS THE SORT OF THING WE'LL LOOK BACK ON ONE DAY WHEN WE'RE OLD MEN, 30, AND WE'LL LAUGH. A CONVERTIBLE! - A SKI TRIP, A BOAT. - GOOD NIGHT, VINNIE.
