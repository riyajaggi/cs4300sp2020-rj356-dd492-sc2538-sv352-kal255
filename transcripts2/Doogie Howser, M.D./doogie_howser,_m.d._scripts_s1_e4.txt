IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK. COME ON, HOWSER, READ BETWEEN THE SHEETS. IF SHE TOLD YOU SHE DON'T HAVE TO BE HOME, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT MEANS? NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT SLEEPING TOGETHER.

DOOGIE, YOU OKAY TO DRIVE? I HAD ONE BEER, VINNIE. I'M FINE. IS THERE A PROBLEM, OFFICER? YOU WERE CLOCKED DOING 50 IN A 35-MILE-AN-HOUR ZONE, SON. I'M REALLY SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO GET TO THE EASTMAN MEDICAL CENTER. IT'S AN EMERGENCY. MY NAME IS DOUGLAS HOWSER AND I'M A DOCTOR. I'M AN INDIAN PRINCESS. LICENSE AND REGISTRATION, PLEASE. IS THERE A PROBLEM? MY WALLET. I MUST HAVE LEFT IT AT HOME. I RACED OUT IN A HURRY. RIGHT. STEP OUT OF THE CAR, PLEASE. WAIT. HERE, HERE... MY PRESCRIPTION PAD. I DON'T THINK YOUR FATHER WOULD APPRECIATE THIS, SON. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'M DR. HOWSER. I MEAN WE ARE BOTH DR. HOWSER, BUT HE'S DAVID, I'M DOUGLAS. LOOK, THIS REALLY IS ME. I'M A RESIDENT AT EASTMAN. YOU CAN CALL THEM. NOW, PLEASE, I'VE GOT TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL. HOW MUCH ALCOHOL HAVE YOU HAD TONIGHT? ALCOHOL?! I HAD ONE BEER. ONE? AND YOU'RE STANDING HERE TRYING TO CONVINCE ME YOU'RE A DOCTOR? YOU DON'T EVEN LOOK OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE, KID. I SWEAR I'M 16 YEARS OLD, I JUST GOT MY LICENSE. ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO A LITTLE TEST. SPREAD YOUR ARMS... I'M NOT DRUNK, DAMN IT! I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO MY PATIENT, IT WILL BE YOUR BUTT. Officer: I'VE GOT A 22-3-50... DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE, A POSSIBLE D.U.I. Dispatcher: We'll notify. Doogie: WHAT WERE THE RESULTS OF HIS CARDIAC ISO ENZYMES? GOOD. NO, THEY GAVE ME A BREATHALYZER, BUT IT CAME UP .03. THEY'RE DROPPING THE D.U.I. CHARGE. LOOK, CURLY, MY FOLKS ARE AT THE RITZ CARLTON LAGUNA. CAN YOU CALL 'EM? THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PICK ME UP. THANKS. UH-OH. - CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING? - NO. HOW YOU COULD DO SOMETHING AS CONTEMPTIBLE AS DRINKING AND DRIVING IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION. AND I WILL NOT TOLERATE IT. BUT, DAD, I WASN'T DRUNK. YOU PUT YOUR LIFE AND THE LIVES OF OTHERS IN DANGER, PLAIN AND SIMPLE. AND YOU WERE ON CALL. THAT, MY FRIEND, IS INEXCUSABLE. Katherine: BESIDES, THE LAST TIME WE CHECKED, DOUGLAS, THE DRINKING AGE IN THIS STATE WAS 21, NOT 16. YOU WANT US TO TREAT YOU LIKE A RESPONSIBLE ADULT AND YOU BEHAVED LIKE AN IMMATURE ADOLESCENT. YOU TAKE OUR TRUST AND THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW. DOOGIE, CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW WE FELT WHEN THE HOSPITAL CALLED? WE WERE TERRIFIED. HOW DO WE KNOW YOU WEREN'T SERIOUSLY HURT, OR... OR GOD FORBID. I HAVE NEVER BEEN AS DISAPPOINTED IN YOU AS I AM RIGHT NOW, DOUGLAS. UH, DAD, THERE'S ONE OTHER THING. THIS CONVERSATION IS OVER, DOUGLAS. Vinnie: HEADS UP, COMING THROUGH. COMING THROUGH. MY PERSIAN CARPET! SO THAT'S WHERE ALL THE PRETZELS WENT. Miss Ann Lloyd to pediatrics. Miss Ann Lloyd to pediatrics. LOOK WHO'S HERE... DR. NO-SHOW. CY, CAN I TALK TO YOU? SURE, WHY NOT? DO I LOOK LIKE I'M BUSY? ABOUT LAST NIGHT, I... I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I'M... I'M REALLY SORRY. - MEH. - NO, I SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE. WHY? SO YOU COULD'VE BEEN DOCTOR 150? THERE WERE A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN WHITE COATS HERE LAST NIGHT. EVERY ONE POKING AND STICKING AND DOING AND LOOKING. THEY ALMOST KILLED ME. WELL, I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE OKAY. AND I PROMISE IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. LOOK, DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF. I'M HERE, I'M FINE, AND LISTEN... IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU, I WOULDN'T HAVE MADE IT THIS LONG. YOU'RE WELL AWARE, DR. HOWSER, THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS HOSPITAL WHO FEEL YOU SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE EMOTIONAL MATURITY TO BE A DOCTOR. ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION, I'VE HAD TO DEFEND YOUR RIGHT TO BE HERE, SOMETIMES AT THE EXPENSE OF MY OWN REPUTATION. BUT NOT THIS TIME. LAST NIGHT... YOU COMPROMISED YOURSELF, THIS HOSPITAL AND THE LIFE OF YOUR PATIENT. THINK FOR A MOMENT OF OUR LIABILITY IF YOU HAD ARRIVED AND ADMINISTERED AID IN AN IMPAIRED CONDITION. OR WORSE... IF THE PATIENT HAD DIED. DOUGLAS, WE'RE ALL GUILTY OF MAKING MISTAKES. BUT THIS IS ONE A DOCTOR CANNOT MAKE AT ANY AGE. YES? WHAT IS THIS REGARDING? OH, ALL RIGHT, YES. TELL THEM I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. LET ME TELL YOU A STORY, DOUGLAS. IN MEDICAL SCHOOL, I KNEW A STUDENT WHO WAS TALKED INTO PARTICIPATING IN A FRATERNITY PRANK. HIS ROLE WAS TO PROCURE A FRESH CADAVER FROM THE BIO LAB. WHICH HE DID, WITHOUT HESITATION. THE CADAVER WAS SURREPTITIOUSLY DELIVERED TO THE LOCAL TRI-DELTA SORORITY DURING A FORMAL DANCE, DRESSED IN A TUXEDO. YES... IT WAS FUNNY. UNTIL THE SORORITY DECIDED TO PRESS CHARGES AGAINST THE MEDICAL SCHOOL... AND THE STUDENT. THE INCIDENT COULD HAVE COST HIM HIS CAREER. HOWEVER, AFTER A GREAT DEAL OF HUMILIATION, THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED. HE'S SINCE GONE ON TO BECOME A VERY... DISTINGUISHED DOCTOR. THE POINT I'M MAKING, DOUGLAS, IS THAT ONE MISTAKE DOES NOT HAVE TO RUIN YOUR CAREER. BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO DECIDE WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. ENOUGH SAID. DR. CANFIELD, I NEVER WOULD HAVE GUESSED YOU WERE THE KIND OF GUY WHO'D STEAL A CADAVER. I DIDN'T. I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR FATHER. HEY. WHAT? I TRIED CALLING YOU AT THE HOSPITAL. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? I WAS THERE. YOU EVER THINK MAYBE I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU? IT CROSSED MY MIND. SO WHAT DID THE COPS DO? THEY CUFF YOU? TAKE MUG SHOTS? YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU? THIS WASN'T A JOKE. YOU KNOW THE KIND OF TROUBLE I'M IN? I GOT NAILED AT WORK. I'M GROUNDED FOR MONTHS. I TOTALLY LOST MY PARENT'S RESPECT. - YEAH, SO? - VINNIE! I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVER LISTEN TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHY I LET YOU IN MY WINDOW. I DON'T KNOW WHY I LET YOU INTO MY LIFE. WHY DO I DO THAT, VINNIE, HUH? CAN YOU TELL ME WHY? 'CAUSE WE'RE BEST FRIENDS. AND I'M THE BITCHINGEST GUY YOU KNOW. UH, I GUESS NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF I DIDN'T INVITE THOSE GUYS, HUH? NO, FORGET IT, IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT, IT WAS MINE. I KNEW I WAS ON CALL. IT WAS STUPID. YEAH, YEAH, IT KIND OF WAS, WASN'T IT? LOOK, I BETTER GET GOING. YOUR DAD CATCHES ME HERE, I'M A MEMORY. LATER. HEY, DOOG, YOU AND ME... WE OKAY? YEAH, SURE, VIN.
