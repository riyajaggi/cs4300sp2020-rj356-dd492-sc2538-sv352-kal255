 Doogie: THE MEDIUS IS AN IMPORTANT HIP STABILIZER AND POSTURAL MUSCLE BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE HIPS LEVEL WHEN WALKING. - Vinnie: UH-HUH. - AND NOTICE THE GLUTEAL LINE. I'M TELLING YOU, DOOG, DECEMBER IS A VERY GOOD MONTH. I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, VIN, BUT LOOK AT JULY. AMAZING LATERAL ROTATORS. DON'T TRY AND GET MINE ON A TECHNICALITY. IF THIS CAN LOOK THAT GOOD IN DECEMBER, COULD YOU IMAGINE WHAT JUNE WILL BRING? I THINK YOU'RE GETTING THROWN BY THE SNOW EFFECT. EITHER THAT OR THE FACT SHE'S ONLY WEARING A PAIR OF EARMUFFS.

 YOUR FOLKS REALLY SAID IT WAS OKAY? THAT'S INCREDIBLE! YEAH, YEAH, I'M SURE IT'S OKAY. UH-HUH, SO I'LL CALL YOU LATER. AND THANKS. BYE. YES! - SCORE! - WHAT, WHAT? I'VE JUST BEEN INVITED TO SPEND THREE DAYS IN THE SPRINGS WITH WANDA AND HER FAMILY. HOWSER, YOU'RE THE LUCKIEST GUY ON THE PLANET! THREE DAYS IN PALM SPRINGS, THAT MEANS TWO NIGHTS IN THE CITY THAT INVENTED THE JACUZZI. WAIT A MINUTE. - OH NO, THAT'S THE FIRST, SECOND AND THIRD. - SO? THAT'S WHEN MY DAD SCHEDULES OUR ANNUAL WEEKEND TOGETHER. IT'S ALWAYS THE FIRST WEEKEND IN DECEMBER. HE'S ONLY YOUR DAD. HE SEES YOU EVERY DAY. JUST BLOW HIM OFF. AS A GUY, HE OUGHT TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW, HE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT IT FOR MONTHS. HE'S USUALLY REALLY INTO IT. MAYBE HE FORGOT. HI, SON. - SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH YOUR THREE-DAY WEEKEND? - I DON'T KNOW YET. I'VE BEEN INVITED TO GO TO PALM SPRINGS WITH WANDA AND HER FOLKS. - SOUNDS PROMISING. - IT'S ALSO THE SAME WEEKEND AS OUR ANNUAL FISHING TRIP WITH MY DAD. WE'VE BEEN GOING CAMPING SINCE I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. - HE LIVES FOR THESE TRIPS. - I SEE YOUR PROBLEM. WE GO OUT THERE AND HE ENDS UP TEACHING ME THE SAME THINGS HE'S TAUGHT ME EVERY YEAR, CONSTANTLY POINTING OUT EVERY BIRD, TREE, AND PLANT. COME ON, DOOG. THAT'S WHAT DADS DO. YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT. THIS IS A MAN WHO TALKS TO THE FISH. - WHO TALKS TO FISH? - DOOGIE'S DAD. IS HE SEEING SOMEBODY ABOUT IT? I WISH MY FATHER TOOK ME FISHING EVERY YEAR. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? THAT I SHOULDN'T GO TO PALM SPRINGS WITH WANDA? LOOK, DOOGIE, ONE OF THESE DAYS YOUR FATHER IS GOING TO END UP LIKE... MR. MARTINI, HERE. AND YOU'LL REGRET NOT HAVING SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS YOU COULD HAVE WITH HIM. I NEVER WENT FISHING WITH MY FATHER. I WAS ALWAYS HIS LITTLE GIRL. I USED TO BEG HIM TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE ALONE. THEN ONE DAY, HE TOOK ME TO A DODGER GAME. I THREW UP IN THE THIRD INNING. HE SPENT THE NEXT FOUR INNINGS TRYING TO COAX ME INTO THE MEN'S ROOM SO THAT HE COULD CLEAN ME UP. HE NEVER TOOK ME ANYWHERE ALONE AFTER THAT. I JUST DON'T THINK I CAN DO IT ANYMORE. HE NEVER STOPS TELLING HIS SAME OLD STORIES. IF I HEAR THE ONE ABOUT THE 15-LB. STEELHEAD HE CAUGHT WITH A PIECE OF SALAMI ONE MORE TIME... LOOK, DOOGIE, GO WITH YOUR DAD. HAVE A GOOD TIME... FOR ME. WHO CAUGHT A STEELHEAD WITH A PIECE OF SALAMI? - TRUST ME, IT'S A LONG STORY. - HIS POP. HE WANTS TO TAKE HIM FISHING, BUT THE KID WANTS TO GO TO PALM SPRINGS WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND WENDY. - WANDA. - RIGHT. HE TAKES HIM EVERY YEAR. THE PROBLEM IS, THE MAN RAPS WITH THE FISH. WELL, DOUGLAS, THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR TRADITION. I FOR MY PART HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT OUR PRIORITY LIES WITH OUR FAMILIES FIRST. MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO GO WITH YOUR FATHER. HE'LL CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT AND I THINK, IN THE LONG RUN, SO WILL YOU. YO, DOUG. TAKE THE WOMAN TO THE DESERT. YOU CAN ALWAYS GO FISHING. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA GRAB A PIZZA SOMEWHERE? NO, I CAN'T. MY MOM MADE DINNER. MAN, I HATE EATING AT HOME WHEN MY GRANDPA COMES OVER. HE'S GOT THIS PROBLEM WITH PHLEGM. OH, DOOGIE! - HI, DAD. - HI, DR. H! SON, I STOPPED OFF AT EDDIE BAUER'S THIS AFTERNOON AND PICKED US UP A FEW THINGS FOR THE TRIP. TRY IT ON AND SEE IF THEY FIT. GREAT DAD. SO, VINCENT, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ONE OF THESE BEFORE? IT'S AN ANTIQUE FENWICK, SPLIT BAMBOO. THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THIS ANYMORE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S QUITE A ROD YOU GOT THERE, DR. HOWSER. Doogie: I'M TELLING YOU, VINNIE, THERE COMES A TIME IN EVERY KID'S LIFE, WHEN YOU REALIZE YOUR FATHER'S NOT THIS SUPERHERO, THAT HE'S JUST ANOTHER GUY. NICE ENSEMBLE, HOWSER. - WOULD YOU TAKE THOSE OFF? - A PIECE OF ADVICE: I WOULDN'T WEAR ANY OF THIS STUFF IN PUBLIC IF I WERE YOU. THIS IS SERIOUS. I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME. ALL RIGHT, OKAY, HERE'S WHAT YOU DO: YOU FIND ONE OF YOUR DAD'S PATIENTS, AND YOU RUN OVER HIM IN THE CAR. - VINNIE. - ONLY ENOUGH SO THAT YOUR DAD HAS TO WORK ON HIM FOR THE WEEKEND. OKAY, OKAY, I GOT IT. I GOT IT, IT'S PERFECT. THIS BETTER BE GOOD. IT'S BETTER THAN GOOD. ARE YOU READY? YOU CON YOUR MOTHER INTO GOING. IT'LL NEVER WORK. ARE YOU KIDDING? IT'S A SURE THING. REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE 10 AND YOU BROKE YOUR LIVING ROOM WINDOW? YOU BROKE OUR LIVING ROOM WINDOW. WHATEVER. WE TOLD YOUR MOM THAT WE FOUND AN INJURED ROBIN THAT MUST HAVE SMACKED ITS HEAD INTO THE GLASS AND THAT WE FIXED ITS WING AND IT FLEW AWAY BEFORE SHE SHOWED UP. THERE WERE TEARS IN HER EYES. SHE ATE IT UP! YEAH, SHE DID, DIDN'T SHE? SO TELL ME, YOU THINK SHE GOT A WHOLE LOT SMARTER SINCE THEN? YOU KNOW, MOM, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE CRYSTAL LAKE IN DECEMBER. THE AIR IS SO FRESH AND CLEAN, IT'S SO INVIGORATING JUST BEING THERE. I BET YOU'D REALLY LOVE IT. WELL, HEY! THAT'S AN IDEA. YOU COULD PROBABLY USE THE TIME AWAY FROM ALL THIS HOUSEWORK. WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH DAD AND TAKE MY PLACE? I-I WOULDN'T MIND. - JUST-JUST THIS ONCE. - NOT ON YOUR LIFE. Howser: ANYWAY, I SUGGESTED WE USE THE LEFTOVER SALAMI AS BAIT. GRANDPA GEORGE SAID I WAS CRAZY. BUT NO SOONER HAD THAT SALAMI, THAT LITTLE PIECE OF SALAMI HIT THE WATER AND WE GOT THE LARGEST STRIKE WE'D EVER HAD. I MEAN, THAT BABY WAS JUMPING TWO, THREE FEET OUT OF THE WATER! WE'D NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT. DAD THOUGHT IT WAS A RAINBOW TROUT, BUT I SAID, "NOT A CHANCE. All: ONLY A WALLEYED PIKE JUMPS LIKE THAT." MOM, PLEASE! DOUGLAS, THERE IS NO WAY I'M GOING FISHING WITH YOUR FATHER. I WAS NOT MADE FOR CAMPING. THIS BODY DOES NOT SLEEP ON THE GROUND. IT'S DIRTY, IT'S COLD AND... AND IT'S DIRTY. AND BESIDES, THERE ARE BUGS AND WHO KNOWS WHAT CRAWLING AROUND OUT THERE. SO WHY DO I HAVE TO GO? BECAUSE YOU HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING BORN A SON. I'M JUST... NOT HIS LITTLE BOY ANYMORE. I'M JUST GONNA... TELL HIM I DON'T WANNA GO. - DAD? - HMM? I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. IT'S ABOUT THE TRIP. UH, THEY'VE BEEN A LOT OF FUN. REALLY... REALLY GREAT. - AND WE'VE BEEN GOING A LONG TIME, HUH? - 10 YEARS. I'M 16 YEARS OLD NOW, DAD. - I KNOW, AND I GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU. - WAIT. - CAN IT JUST WAIT A SECOND? - IT'LL TAKE A MINUTE. DAD, NO, DAD... I WAS GONNA WAIT TO DO THIS UP AT THE LAKE, BUT NOW IS AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY. GRANDPA GEORGE GAVE ME THIS HAT WHEN I TURNED 16. AND I'D ALWAYS HOPED I WOULD HAVE A BOY TO PASS IT DOWN TO. HERE. TRY IT ON. YOU'RE A GREAT FISHING COMPANION, SON. Howser: COME ON, MR. FISH! DOESN'T THAT LOOK LIKE A DELICIOUS LITTLE WORM? DAD, DO YOU REALLY THINK TALKING TO THE FISH IS GONNA WORK? THEY'RE PROBABLY DOWN THERE LAUGHING AT US. IT'S AN OLD TECHNIQUE THAT I PICKED UP FROM YOUR GRANDFATHER. HE WAS CONVINCED IT WORKED. HE WAS QUITE PARTIAL TO USING HEMINGWAY'S SHORT STORIES. I REMEMBER ONE INCIDENT WHERE THE... THE FISH PRACTICALLY JUMPED INTO THE BOAT. DAD, I'M KIND OF GETTING HUNGRY. ISN'T IT ABOUT TIME WE HEAD ON IN? WHOA. WHOA! OKAY! OKAY! - OKAY, OKAY. - HERE WE GO! - COME ON, DOOGIE, GET THE NET. - OKAY, COME ON. - GET THE NET... WHOA! - A LITTLE MORE. - HEE HEE HEE! HERE COMES DINNER! - I... GOT IT! WHOA. ALL... RIGHT. GREAT, DAD, JUST GREAT. - HERMIT THRUSH. - CORRECT. CATHARUS GUTTATUS, SOMETIMES KNOWN AS A SWAMP ANGEL. SOME CONSIDER IT THE FINEST SONGSTER IN NORTH AMERICA. HERE... HERE'S ONE. RED-BREASTED NUTHATCH, A SMALL, ACTIVE BIRD WHOSE MIGRATION IS IRREGULAR AND DEPENDS ON CORN-FED SEEDS. VERY GOOD, DOUGLAS! YOU GOT 'EM ALL THIS YEAR! SO... UH... HOW ARE THINGS WITH YOU AND WANDA? FINE. WELL, SHE'S A VERY SWEET GIRL. VERY... GROWN-UP. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THIS... COOKING OUR OWN DINNER, ENJOYING THE FRESH AIR, AND HAVING OUR LITTLE TALKS. I CAN'T THINK OF ANYWHERE I'D RATHER BE RIGHT NOW. CAN YOU, DOOGIE? OIL ME. ALL RIGHT, GANG, IT MAY NOT BE EGGS BENEDICT, BUT WOULDN'T A JUICY WORM MAKE A NICE WAY TO START YOUR DAY, HUH? DAD, IT'S ALMOST 1:00. YOU MIGHT WANNA TRY THE LUNCH MENU. THEY OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T WANT BREAKFAST. DOOGIE? WHY DON'T YOU TRY OL' FENWICK HERE, HUH? YOU MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE BETTER LUCK WITH THIS, HUH? - I DOUBT IT. - OH, COME ON. OKAY? YOU'VE EARNED THE RIGHT TO HANDLE THIS BEAUTY. NOW, OKAY, NOW REMEMBER WHAT I SHOWED YOU. NICE AND EASY, IT'S ALL IN THE WRIST. - YOU JUST CAST OFF YOUR NOSE... - I KNOW, DAD. AND YOUR RELEASE POINT IS RIGHT OVER THE HORIZON, ALL RIGHT? WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, I GOT ONE! HA HA! - SET THE HOOK, SET THE HOOK. - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. OKAY, GO EASY, GO EASY. NOT TOO MUCH TENSION. I GOT IT, I GOT IT! VERY GOOD! HEY, YOU'RE DOING FINE! NOW LET HIM HAVE A LITTLE LINE IF HE WANTS. LOOSEN UP THE GRIP. HERE. - I CAN DO IT MYSELF! - YEAH, LET ME HELP YOU. NO! - DOOGIE! - WHOA, WHOA! DOOGIE! DOUGLAS, I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE SO ANGRY. WE CAUGHT THE FISH! IT'S A GOOD-SIZED CRITTER, I MIGHT ADD. YOU DON'T GET IT, DAD. YOU JUST DON'T GET IT. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT! I NEVER WANTED TO COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE! - WHAT? - I COULD BE IN PALM SPRINGS WITH WANDA RIGHT NOW, BUT OH NO, INSTEAD I'M STUCK OUT HERE FREEZING MY BUTT OFF, LISTENING TO YOU TALK TO THE FISH! I THOUGHT YOU LIKED THESE TRIPS. WELL, I DON'T. I-I'M TIRED OF SLEEPING ON THE GROUND. I'M TIRED OF GUESSING YOUR BIRD-CALLS, I'M TIRED OF YOU GIVING ME INSTRUCTIONS LIKE I'M STILL A LITTLE BOY. I NEVER REALIZED YOU FELT LIKE THIS, DOUGLAS. I'M SURPRISED YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BEFORE THIS. WELL, I TRIED, BUT YOU MADE ME FEEL SO GUILTY WHEN YOU GAVE ME GRANDPA GEORGE'S HAT. WELL, BELIEVE ME, DOUGLAS, THAT WAS NEVER MY INTENTION. I KNOW, DAD. LOOK, I'VE... I'VE JUST GROWN OUT OF THESE TRIPS. I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T WANT TO BE THE GREAT WHITE HUNTER. MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST KEEP GRANDPA GEORGE'S HAT. Teen: OH PLEASE, CAN YOU HELP US? WE WERE HIKING AND... MY DAD FELL OFF THE EMBANKMENT AND HIT IS HEAD ON A ROCK. COME ON, THAT'S IT. ALL RIGHT. - GOOD, GREAT. - LET'S LAY HIM DOWN. - MIND HIS HEAD. - I GOT HIM. YOU ALL RIGHT? HE MAY HAVE A C-SPINE FRACTURE. BRACE HIS NECK. GO INTO THE TENT AND GET A TOWEL. - WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - FRANK. FRANK, MY NAME IS DAVID HOWSER. I'M A DOCTOR. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED? THE PATH... FELL... - MY HEAD... - AH, AH, AH, EASY. AL-ALAN? I'M RIGHT HERE, DAD. FRANK, WHERE ARE YOU FROM? - ST. LOUIS, ST. LOUIS. - DAD, DAD, DAD. WE'RE FROM SAN DIEGO. THEY'RE BOTH EQUAL. Doogie: FRANK, I WANT YOU TO SQUEEZE MY FINGERS AS HARD AS YOU CAN. YOU UNDERSTAND? HE'S VERY WEAK ON THE LEFT SIDE. HE MAY HAVE A SUBDURAL HEMATOMA. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIM IN THE WAGON. THERE'S A RANGER'S STATION A FEW MILES BACK. USE THE... BLANKET. EASY, EASY, EASY. HELP ME, SON. Man on radio: That's a negative on the helicopter. There's another storm moving in and the winds are too dangerous. - We're dispatching an ambulance. - WE'LL AWAIT THEIR ARRIVAL. THIS IS RANGER STATION CAMMY 22, OUT. THE ROADS ARE ALREADY A MESS UP HERE. IT'S GONNA TAKE AT LEAST TWO HOURS. WE MAY NOT HAVE THAT LONG. HE HAS SIGNS OF INCREASED INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE. HE COULD HERNIATE HIS BRAINSTEM. YOU'RE RIGHT. WE'D BETTER BE PREPARED. EXCUSE ME, FELLAS. COULD YOU BRING ME UP TO SPEED HERE? SURE, HE'S BLEEDING IN HIS HEAD. WE MAY NEED TO DRILL A HOLE IN HIS SKULL TO EVACUATE THE BLOOD. - YOU'RE KIDDING... HERE? - YEAH, DO YOU HAVE A DRILL OR A BRACE AND BIT AROUND HERE? YEAH, WE HAVE A POWER DRILL IN OUR TOOL-SHED. GOOD, WE'LL NEED IT. ALSO GET A HALF-INCH DRILL BIT. WE NEED TO BOIL THEM TO STERILIZE IT. WE NEED A RAZOR TO SHAVE HIS HEAD, SOAP, WATER AND CLEAN TOWELS. DO YOU HAVE TWO DINNER FORKS WE CAN BEND? WE'LL NEED TO STERILIZE THEM TO USE AS RETRACTORS. Teen: DOCTOR HOWSER. HE WAS JUST LYING HERE TALKING TO ME, WHEN HE JUST PASSED OUT. HIS RIGHT PUPIL'S BLOWN. HIS BREATHING'S GETTING SHALLOW. - WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER? - HE WENT TO THE CAR. SON, YOUR FATHER HAS GOT BLOOD CAUSING PRESSURE ON HIS BRAIN, AND WE HAVE GOT TO DO A LITTLE SURGERY RIGHT AWAY, JUST TO RELEASE THAT PRESSURE. Doogie: HURRY UP WITH THAT STUFF. OH GOD. SHOULDN'T WE WAIT TILL WE GET HIM TO THE HOSPITAL? IF WE COULD, WE WOULD. NOW WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS WAIT IN THE CAR WITH YOUR BROTHER, OKAY? DR. HOWSER? IS MY FATHER GONNA DIE? NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT, SON. NOT IF WE CAN HELP IT. THIS IS THE BEST I'VE GOT. - THAT LOOKS HEAVY. - IT IS. I'VE GOT SOME LIDOCAINE IN MY BAG WHY DON'T YOU PREP HIS SCALP? LET ME HANDLE THE DRILL. YEAH, OKAY. WE WENT IN RIGHT HERE. UGH, GROSS! STOP! THAT'S DISGUSTING! YOU REALLY DRILLED THE GUY'S HEAD? WE HAD TO. I'M TELLING YOU, VIN, IT WAS INCREDIBLE! YOU KNOW, YOU GOT A WEIRD IDEA ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES A GOOD TIME! DID YOU SEE WANDA YET? I BET SHE'S GOT SOME MEAN TAN LINES. ACTUALLY, I JUST TALKED TO HER. AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TAN LINES. NO TAN LINES?! HEY, DUDE. PROMISE ME YOU WON'T TELL ANYONE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME WITH YOUR DAD. EVER SINCE MY OLD MAN HEARD YOU WERE GOING AWAY, HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT TAKING ME SOMEPLACE. THE LAST TIME WE WENT AWAY TOGETHER WE STAYED AT THE DISNEYLAND HOTEL. THE WHOLE WEEKEND HE WORE THOSE EARS WITH HIS NAME ACROSS THE FRONT, CARMINE, SINGING "IT'S A SMALL WORLD." - I GET THE SWEATS JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. - I PROMISE. - DADS CAN BE WEIRD DUDES, HUH? - YEAH. SEE YA, DOOG. GOOD NIGHT, VIN. - HI, DAD. - I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH FRANK WEBSTER'S BOYS. THEIR FATHER'S DOING FINE, NO COMPLICATIONS. - THAT'S GREAT. - IT SURE IS. WELL... GOOD NIGHT, SON. DAD? - YOU WERE GREAT OUT THERE. - WE WERE GREAT. NO, I COULDN'T HAVE DONE WHAT YOU DID. I MEAN, I KNOW HOW TO DO IT, BUT I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT. YOU'RE A GREAT DOCTOR, DAD. I SEE YOU'VE FOUND YOUR GRANDFATHER'S HAT. - OH. - I WAS AFRAID I'D LOST IT. IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO HANG ONTO IT FOR A WHILE, AT LEAST TILL I HAVE A SON TO PASS IT DOWN TO. GOOD NIGHT, DOUGLAS. GOOD NIGHT, DAD. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
