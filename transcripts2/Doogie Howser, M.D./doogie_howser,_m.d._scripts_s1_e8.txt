THAT'S NOT IT, VINNIE. I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE GOING OUT. RIGHT. LOOK, HOWSER, WHY DON'T YOU CALL HER? HUMILIATE YOURSELF AND WE'LL ALL BE HAPPY. SHE STARTED THIS. IT DOESN'T MATTER. SHE'S WAITING FOR YOU TO CALL. TRUST ME. I KNOW WOMEN. I STUDY THEM. WHAT DO YOU THINK, DR. HOWSER? YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WOMEN. I THINK WHO STARTED THE FIGHT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS FORGIVING ONE ANOTHER. MAN TO MAN, HE'S GOT TO CALL HER, RIGHT? EVERY TIME MY MOM GETS MAD AT MY DAD, HE HAS TO APOLOGIZE AND TURN ON THE DELPINO CHARM. LOOK. WANDA KNOWS IT'S HER RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE APOLOGY. HE DOESN'T GET IT.

LET HIS SECRETARY GIVE IT TO HIM. SHE HAS BEEN ALL ALONG. - Canfield: MRS. AARON. - DON'T "MRS. AARON" ME! - I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A DIVORCE. - AND I HAVE A JOB TO DO! WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD GET OUT OF YOUR WAY, DOCTOR. WAIT! I HOPE YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS ILLEGAL. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW, ALL PERSONAL BODILY FLUIDS ARE COMMUNITY PROPERTY, NOT LIMITED TO AND INCLUDING BLOOD. A BREACH OF THESE DUTIES WOULD RESULT IN A SUIT AGAINST YOU, NOT FOR ONLY SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE TO DRAIN FROM YOU MR. AARON'S STATUTORY SHARE OF BLOOD BUT ALSO FOR PAIN, SUFFERING AND INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, NOT TO MENTION THE CRIMINAL STATUTES APPLICABLE SHOULD HE DIE... MA'AM. ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH. - 45. GET MRS. AARON TO THE BLOOD BANK. WE'LL NEED ANOTHER PINT IN 24 HOURS AND SCHEDULE MR. AARON FOR A LAPAROTOMY. A MOMENT, DR. HOWSER.

I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE TO APOLOGIZE. OKAY, YOU FORCE ME INTO THIS. SIX GENERATIONS OF DELPINO MEN KNOW THE SECRET TO END ANY PROBLEM WITH A WOMAN. - YEAH? WHAT? - ROSES. BUT THE SECRET IS THE LOVE POEM YOU SEND WITH THEM. - I CAN'T WRITE POETRY. - YOU NEED INSPIRATION. BRIAN JOHNSON IS SIX FEET OF HAIRY INSPIRATION. NO WAY. IF SHE CARED, SHE'D CALL. DOES BRIAN JOHNSON SHAVE YET? RUMOR IS BY FIFTH PERIOD HE HAS A SHADOW. HEY, WANT A FEW LAUGHS? WE CAN GO LOOK THROUGH MY SISTER'S UNDERWEAR DRAWER. NAH. I WAS PAGED. WHO WANTS TO SEE ME?

YOU FORGET THAT'S THE PERSON YOU SPENT 15 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE WITH. THAT'S GREAT. AND IT... IT MADE US REALIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN AVOIDING GETTING DIVORCED. I MEAN, WE MAY NOT BE A GOOD COUPLE BUT IF WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS MAYBE IT'LL BE EASIER IF WE DO IT AS GOOD FRIENDS. YOU'RE STILL GETTING DIVORCED? I COULD'VE HAVE TWO LIKE YOU BY NOW. - Wanda's mother: WANDA? - YES, I TOOK A JACKET! - HI. - HI. - YOU LOOK UPSET. - YOU KNOW THAT COUPLE I TOLD YOU ABOUT?

I GUESS, BUT THEY SAY THEY STILL LOVE EACH OTHER. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS 10 MY MOTHER LEFT MY FATHER. - REALLY? - YEAH. IT WAS AWFUL. WE LIVED IN AN APARTMENT IN CULVER CITY AND MY PARENTS WERE ALWAYS SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER. WHAT HAPPENED? AFTER SIX MONTHS OF MARRIAGE COUNSELING THEY GOT BACK TOGETHER. I'M GLAD. BUT EVER SINCE THEY'VE BEEN TOTALLY SICKENING WITH EACH OTHER... KISSING, FOOLING AROUND, LOCKING THEIR DOOR EVEN IN THE AFTERNOON. GERIATRIC SEX PERVERTS FROM MARS.

I DON'T WANT IT TO. BUT I MEAN, STATISTICALLY... - I DON'T CARE ABOUT STATISTICS. - THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE. BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE YOU, WANDA.
