WHEREAS THE HUMAN FEMALE REACHES HER SEXUAL PEAK BETWEEN THE AGES OF 35 AND 45. WHOA, WHOA! BACK UP A SECOND.

HOW CAN A WOMAN SO BEAUTIFUL BE SO COLD? MAYBE SHE'S JUST ONE OF THOSE VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN WHO FEEL THAT IN ORDER TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AS A DOCTOR, SHE HAS TO SUPPRESS HER SEXUALITY. OR...

OH, IT DIDN'T SHOW. YOU WERE REAL COOL. I DON'T FEEL SO COOL NOW. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF ADRENALINE PUMPING. I KNOW. YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SLEEP FOR HOURS. I'M GONNA GO HOME, MAKE SOMETHING TO EAT, LIFT SOME WEIGHTS. I'LL PROBABLY BE JUMPING OUT OF MY SKIN TILL 4:00 IN THE MORNING. - ISN'T BEING A DOCTOR GREAT? - I LIKE YOU, DR. HOWSER. THANKS.

YOU MUST BE CURIOUS WHY I ASKED YOU OUT TO DINNER TONIGHT. ME? OH NO. WELL, MAYBE A LITTLE. OKAY, WHY? DOOGIE, I FIND YOU VERY, VERY APPEALING. - IS THIS A JOKE? - NO. YOU HAVE EVERY QUALITY I ADMIRE IN A MAN... A BRILLIANT MIND, DEDICATION TO YOUR WORK, SINCERITY, GOOD LOOKS. THANK YOU. THERE'S A LOT I LIKE ABOUT YOU TOO. ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING. THERE IS SOMETHING I WANNA ASK YOU. SOMETHING... I'M FINDING THIS VERY DIFFICULT. NO, YOU'RE DOING GOOD. YOU'RE DOING GOOD. A FEW MONTHS AGO MY DOORBELL RANG. I OPENED THE DOOR AND OUT IN THE HALLWAY WAS A MAN FROM A DIAPER DELIVERY SERVICE. HE HAD A STACK OF DIAPERS, IT MUST HAVE BEEN FOUR FEET HIGH. I TOLD HIM HE WAS AT THE WRONG DOOR, THEY WEREN'T FOR ME. AND THEN I STARTED TO CRY. I'M APPROACHING 40. MY BIOLOGICAL CLOCK IS TICKING. I'M NOT MARRIED, BUT I DO WANT TO RAISE A CHILD. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT I'M SAYING? YOU WANT TO ADOPT ME? I WAS WONDERING IF YOU'D CONSIDER FATHERING MY CHILD. SIR, ARE YOU READY TO ORDER? WHAT, NOW? - COULD YOU GIVE US A FEW MORE MOMENTS? - CERTAINLY. I KNOW THIS IS AN UNUSUAL REQUEST. ESPECIALLY ON A FIRST DATE. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND I'M NOT ASKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP. I WILL BE TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS CHILD, BOTH EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY. ALL I NEED FROM YOU IS... WELL, YOU KNOW. WOW. THIS IS... WOW. YOU SEE, SINCE I'M APPROACHING MOTHERHOOD SCIENTIFICALLY, I MIGHT AS WELL CHOOSE THE MAN WITH THE BEST GENES AVAILABLE. GEE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I KNOW THIS IS A BIG DECISION. PLEASE TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT SOME MORE, JUST LET ME KNOW. NOW... WHY DON'T WE JUST LEAVE IT ALONE, AND... - ENJOY THE REST OF THE NIGHT? - OKAY, GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. WOW. SO WHAT'S THE QUESTION? THIS IS THE GREATEST THING TO HAPPEN TO A 16-YEAR-OLD GUY IN THE HISTORY OF HORMONES. YOU WON THE LIBIDO LOTTERY, HOWSER! SHE'S A MATURE WOMAN. CHANCES ARE SHE'S BEEN WITH OTHER GUYS. - SHE'S GONNA COMPARE! - SO? IF SHE BUSTS OUT LAUGHING, YOU PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON AND GO HOME! - I WISH SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED ME! - WILL YOU STOP?! YOU'RE GETTING HYSTERICAL! THE WOMAN WANTS YOU! - DON'T FIGHT IT! - TECHNICALLY SHE DOESN'T WANT ME, - SHE WANTS MY GENES. - WHO CARES?! THE POINT IS SHE'S LETTING YOU DELIVER THEM PERSONALLY. I DON'T KNOW. THIS IS GONNA TAKE SOME VERY SERIOUS THOUGHT. FORGET YOUR MIND FOR ONCE. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. WHAT'S YOUR BODY SAYING TO YOU? IT'S SAYING... - "WAMPA-WAMPA." - YES! TESTOSTERONE LIVES! HERE'S THE PHONE. CALL HER NOW, SHE MIGHT CHANGE HER MIND. IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT TELLING ME? IS THIS WOMAN A BLOOD BEAST? NO, SHE'S BEAUTIFUL. I CAN'T BELIEVE A WOMAN THAT BEAUTIFUL WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME. - I'LL DIAL FOR YOU. - WHAT IF IT'S NOT RIGHT? NOT RIGHT? IT'S PERFECT! WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN OLDER WOMAN HERE. SHE'S PEAKING! YOU'RE PEAKING! WHAT COULD BE MORE BEAUTIFUL? YEAH, IT DOES SEEM LIKE DESTINY, DOESN'T IT? AND THE THING IS, IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK THE FIRST TIME. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO DO IT LIKE... 10 OR 15 TIMES. - Dr. Miller call... - HEY! - MORNING, DOOGS. - HI. - YOU WORK LAST NIGHT? - NO, I JUST DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP. - PROBLEM? - YEAH. BUT IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. IT'S A FRIEND'S PROBLEM. WE WERE UP ALL NIGHT BATTING IT AROUND. - CAN I ASK YOU GUYS A QUESTION? - SURE. SEE, THIS GUY, THIS FRIEND OF MINE, HE'S GOTTEN HIMSELF INTO KIND OF A... SEXUAL DILEMMA. SEE, THERE'S THIS WOMAN. SHE'S TWICE HIS AGE. ACTUALLY SHE'S 2.3 TIMES HIS AGE. AND WELL, SHE WANTS TO SLEEP WITH HIM. WHAT? SO YOUR FRIEND'S PROBLEM IS THIS WOMAN WANTS TO SLEEP WITH HIM? NO, IF IT WERE JUST THAT, HE COULD STUMBLE THROUGH IT HIMSELF. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS SHE WANTS TO HAVE HIS BABY. WHAT? YEAH, SHE THINKS HE'S KIND OF HER IDEAL MAN, YOU KNOW? SO WHAT DOES YOUR FRIEND THINK HE SHOULD DO? WELL, HE THINKS SHE DESERVES TO HAVE A BABY IF SHE WANTS TO. AND SHE'S INTELLIGENT. AND HE IS VERY INTELLIGENT. SO, GIVEN THE LAWS OF GENETICS, I MEAN, WHO KNOWS? THIS KID COULD GROW UP TO CURE CANCER SOMEDAY. SO, IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR FRIEND WOULD BE DOING THIS FOR THE GOOD OF MANKIND? YOU COULD SAY IT'S A PHILANTHROPIC KIND OF THING. IT COULDN'T BE JUST BECAUSE HE WANTS TO HAVE SEX? YOU COULD GO THAT WAY, TOO. I DON'T KNOW. A CHILD IS A BIG RESPONSIBILITY. BUT THE WOMAN SAID SHE'D TAKE ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY. WELL, BUT IT WOULD STILL BE HIS BABY. HOW IS YOUR FRIEND GONNA FEEL KNOWING THERE'S A CHILD OUT THERE HE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH? DOES YOUR FRIEND HAVE A GIRLFRIEND? - YEAH. - Curly: DO THEY HAVE SEX? NO. I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE. BUT HE'S VERY POLITE, SO PROBABLY NOT. WHAT'S HE GONNA TELL HER ABOUT ALL THIS? HE THOUGHT MAYBE HE COULD JUST... SKIP OVER THAT PART OF HIS LIFE. YOU MEAN LIE TO HER. WELL, HE DIDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY. Curly: BOY, DOOGIE. I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD MAKE A DECISION LIKE THAT NOW, NEVER MIND AT 16. WISH YOUR FRIEND LUCK FOR ME. YEAH, I WILL. THANKS. - I GOT ROUNDS. - Mrs. Harvey, 6920. - THANKS. I'LL BE IN THE RADIOLOGY ROOM. - MM-HM. DR. BURKE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU FOR A MINUTE. I'M AWFULLY BUSY. CAN IT WAIT? IT'S ABOUT DOOGIE HOWSER. AFTER YOU. Dr. Miller, call the nurses' station. Dr. Miller. I FOUND OUT ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL TO DOOGIE. I FEEL A LITTLE AWKWARD BRINGING IT UP. MAYBE YOU SHOULD. IT'S REALLY NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. I THINK IT IS MY BUSINESS. DOOGIE'S MY FRIEND. AND WHILE INTELLECTUALLY HE'S A GIANT, EMOTIONALLY HE'S A 16-YEAR-OLD BOY. THERE'S NO WAY HE CAN COME OUT OF AN AFFAIR WITH YOU - WITHOUT GETTING HURT. - AFFAIR?! I HAVE NO INTENTION OF HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH HIM. CALL IT WHAT YOU WANT! I MAY ONLY BE A RESIDENT, BUT I DO KNOW HOW BABIES ARE CONCEIVED. THEN, DOCTOR, YOU MUST ALSO KNOW ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION. THEN YOU DIDN'T ASK DOOGIE TO, UM... - YOU KNOW. - NO. I SPECIFICALLY SAID TO HIM I WAS INTERESTED IN HIS GENES. I THOUGHT HE UNDERSTOOD I WAS TALKING ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION. WELL YOU THOUGHT WRONG. DOOGIE'S THINKING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED NATURAL INSEMINATION. I DIDN'T INTENTIONALLY MEAN TO BE VAGUE. DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO BE VERY HURT? HE'S 16. HE THINKS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD WANTS TO MAKE LOVE WITH HIM. WHAT DO YOU THINK? Doogie: DR. BURKE? I GOT YOUR MESSAGE. I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME BY. YOU LOOK PRETTY IN THIS LIGHT. THAT'S WHY I BECAME A RADIOLOGIST. DOOGIE, WE NEED TO TALK. YEAH, WE DO. WE REALLY DO. HEY, IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A SMALL BOWEL OBSTRUCTION. THERE'S SOME AIR IN THE BILIARY TREE. DOOGIE, ABOUT LAST NIGHT. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. SEE, I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK I DON'T THINK YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. BECAUSE I DO. I MEAN YOU ARE. THE WHOLE IDEA THAT SOMEONE AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU ACTUALLY WANTS ME IS GONNA MAKE ME FEEL FANTASTIC FOR I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG, MAYBE THE REST OF MY LIFE. BUT I CAN'T DO IT. I JUST CAN'T. SEE, I WANNA HAVE CHILDREN SOMEDAY. AND I WANT TO SHARE IT WITH MY WIFE. AND IF WE DO THIS, I'M AFRAID IT JUST... IT MIGHT... SPOIL THAT. I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY. I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE A CHILD SOMEDAY. AND I HOPE YOU FALL IN LOVE. THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PICK ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU. YOU ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN... AND SUCH A SWEET BOY. MAYBE WE SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK. YEAH. I'M GONNA REMEMBER THIS FOR A LONG TIME. YOU CAN TELL YOUR GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT IT. NO. I THINK I'LL SAVE THIS FOR MYSELF. Dr. Wilgate to obstetrics, Dr. Wilgate to obstetrics. Dr. Murray, call third floor nurses' station. Dr. Murray call third... VINNIE, YOU'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR 15 MINUTES. YOU HAD IT IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. AND POOF! NOW IT'S GONE. YOU'RE A TOTAL WUSS. IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT. I'D EVEN HAVE TO LIE TO WANDA. I'LL GET ANOTHER CHANCE. DON'T YOU READ THE PAPER? THERE COULD BE A NUCLEAR WAR TOMORROW AND WE COULD ALL BE DEAD. AND YOU DIDN'T GET TO DO IT! AND I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR ABOUT IT! WELL, VINNIE. I GUESS THE THING TO DO IS WORK FOR WORLD PEACE. HEY, THIS ISN'T FUNNY, HOWSER. YOU BLEW IT. YOU SHATTERED MY DREAM. DON'T EVER SHOW YOUR FACE AROUND HERE AGAIN. VINNIE, THIS IS MY ROOM. OKAY, ALL RIGHT. SO I'M LEAVING. YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU. WE NO LONGER HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON! I NEVER WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU AGAIN. YOU'RE OUT OF MY LIFE! I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW, OKAY? OKAY. WHAT A WUSS!
