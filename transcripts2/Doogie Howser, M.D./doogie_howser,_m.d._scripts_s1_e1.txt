WE DID A CHEST X-RAY, EKG, AND AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM. HE HAS A MURMUR OF MITRAL INSUFFICIENCY. I GAVE HIM DIGOXIN .125 MILLIGRAMS; LASIX 20 MILLIGRAMS, B.I.D.; AND ALDACTA 12.5 MILLIGRAMS B.I.D. ALSO, I'D LIKE TO SEND HIM TO NUCLEAR MEDICINE - FOR A CARDIAC SCAN AT 9:30. - THANK YOU, DR. HOWSER. ALL RIGHT PEOPLE, LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK. Cardiology intern, report to o.R.3.

BUT STATISTICALLY, HE'S GOT A BETTER CHANCE IF WE JUST REPAIR THE VALVE. DR. CANFIELD, THIS KID'S BEEN IN FAILURE A LONG TIME. LET'S GET HIM OUT OF FAILURE, BUILD HIM UP, THEN DO THE TRANSPLANT. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MY LEARNED COLLEAGUE HERE, I HAVE SPENT MORE YEARS FIXING HEARTS - THAN HE'S BEEN ALIVE. - HENRY... AND I DO NOT NEED SOME 16-YEAR-OLD, SNOT-NOSED GENIUS TELLING ME HOW TO DO MY JOB! MY CALL IS TO DO THE TRANSPLANT. DOES MY CALL STAND OR NOT? GIVEN THE VERY REAL POSSIBILITY THIS BOY MIGHT NOT SURVIVE EITHER PROCEDURE... YES, YOUR CALL STANDS. YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM! AND YOU DON'T GIVE A CRAP! DOUGLAS. DR. HOWSER! - YOU WILL BEHAVE. - DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE YOU'RE MY FATHER! YOU'RE NOT! Doogie's voice: "SEPTEMBER 21st, 1989. TODAY IS MY 16th BIRTHDAY.

'CAUSE I'M GONNA GET SEX AND YOU'VE NEVER EVEN KISSED A GIRL. - I'VE KISSED PLENTY. - NAME ONE. - WANDA PLENN, TOMORROW NIGHT. - OH YEAH, RIGHT. I'M GONNA DO IT DURING A SLOW DANCE. IT'S ALL FIGURED OUT. I'M GONNA TELL HER HER HAIR SMELLS GREAT. THEN I'M GONNA LEAN IN AND SNIFF HER SHAMPOO. GIRLS LOVE GETTING SNIFFED. THEN... I GIVE HER A LICK ON HER LOBULAE AURICULORAE. YOU'RE GONNA DO IT IN PUBLIC? IT'S HER EARLOBE, STUPID. AND IF SHE DOESN'T PULL BACK, THEN I KNOW IT'S OKAY FOR ME TO GIVE WANDA THE BIG WET ONE. Howser: THE BIG WHAT? - OH HI, DAD. - HIYA, DR.

YOU'RE NOT EXCUSED FROM THIS TABLE, YOUNG MAN. SIT DOWN! EMOTIONALLY MATURITY IS NOT A FUNCTION OF GENIUS, MY FRIEND. IT IS A FUNCTION OF EXPERIENCE. AND YOU HAVE AMPLY DEMONSTRATED BY YOUR BEHAVIOR HERE THAT YOU ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY. YEAH, YEAH, DAD. - WHAT? - NOTHING. Man: I COME IN HERE, AN EMERGENCY, EXPECTING A QUALIFIED PHYSICIAN AND I GET A 16-YEAR-OLD KID. THAT'S NEGLIGENCE, - PURE AND SIMPLE. - IF YOU COULD JUST HOLD STILL, MR. FINKELSTEIN. YOU'LL BE HOLDING STILL FOR A BIG FAT LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT! 16 YEARS OLD. I'LL ADD A COUNT FOR INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS. WELL I'M SORRY YOU FEEL THIS WAY, SIR. BUT AS AN ATTORNEY, YOU MUST KNOW THERE'S NO DUTY OWED BY THE HOSPITAL WITH RESPECT TO THE AGE OF ITS DOCTORS. NOR IS THERE ANY PROXIMATE CAUSE CONNECTING ME TO THE HARM SUFFERED. AND EVEN IF YOU COULD MAKE OUT A PRIMA FACIE CASE OF NEGLIGENCE, YOU DON'T HAVE DIVERSITY JURISDICTION TO GET THIS INTO FEDERAL COURT. BESIDES WHICH, I'M DONE. - YOU'RE DONE? - YEP.
