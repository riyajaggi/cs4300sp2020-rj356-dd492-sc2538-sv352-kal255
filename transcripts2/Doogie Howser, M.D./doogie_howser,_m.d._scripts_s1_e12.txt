 LOOK AT HIM. HIS SKIN, HIS EYES, HE'S JAUNDICED. IT COULD BE HEPATITIS, A STONE, HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA, CANCER, SEPSIS, ANYTHING. WE'VE GOT TO ADMIT HIM AND RUN SOME TESTS. I'M SORRY, DR. HOWSER. HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ADDRESS, NO SOCIAL SECURITY, NO INSURANCE AND HE ONLY GOES BY THE NAME OF JUPITER. NOW COME ON. - HE'S A HUMAN BEING. ISN'T THAT ENOUGH? - NOT IN THIS HOSPITAL. Dr. Ohada to C.C.U., code blue. Dr. Ohada to C.C.U., code blue. GO TO THE COUNTY HEALTH CARE CENTER. THIS IS THE ADDRESS. ASK FOR DR. BENNETT. HE'S A GOOD BUDDY. AND... UH...

 All new interns report to O.R. 3 for observation. - JUST DOING MY JOB. - MISS McCORMACK, YOU KNOW THAT PINK ORGAN DONOR CARD AT THE BACK OF YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE? - YES, I HAVE ONE. - SCRATCH OFF HEART. DR. HOWSER? CAN I SEE YOU IN THERE FOR A MINUTE? I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION, BUT DON'T KILL THE MESSENGER. SHE'S JUST DOING HER JOB. THIS IS THE FOURTH HOMELESS PERSON I'VE TURNED AWAY TODAY. WE'RE NOT TALKING CUTS AND BRUISES HERE. THERE'S A FLU EPIDEMIC OUT THERE. THESE PEOPLE COULD DIE. THERE ARE COUNTY FACILITIES, DOUGLAS. HOW ARE THEY GONNA GET THERE? THEY HAVE NO MONEY. I'M ON YOUR SIDE, EMOTIONALLY.

 BUT ECONOMICALLY, I HAVE A BUDGET TO ANSWER TO. HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY SPENDING A MILLION DOLLARS ON A BILIARY LITHOTRIPTER, WHEN WE'RE TURNING AWAY PEOPLE TO DIE IN A DOORWAY? I WISH WE COULD DO BOTH, DOCTOR. BUT THE REALITY IS, WHEN PEOPLE DONATE A MILLION DOLLARS, THEY WANT THEIR NAMES ON A SHINY GOLD PLAQUE NAILED TO A WALL. AND UNFORTUNATELY, MONEY TALKS. Dr. Canfield, please report to the boardroom. AND WHEN MONEY TALKS, I HAVE TO LISTEN. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn HOW IS IT, DR. CANFIELD, THAT YOU'RE RUNNING AN AVERAGE OCCUPANCY OF 90% WITH A GROSS INCOME OF OVER $200 MILLION, AND YET YOUR BOTTOM LINE IS BARELY 1/10 OF 1% IN THE BLACK? MARGERIE, THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS ARE CUTTING BACK ON WHAT THEY'RE PAYING, LEAVING US WITH A LOT OF BAD DEBTS. ADDITIONALLY, MEDICARE PATIENTS MAKE UP OVER 50% OF OUR ADMISSIONS. AND RIGHT NOW, MEDICARE IS PAYING LESS THAN COST. WE ALL KNOW ABOUT MEDICARE, BUT YOU STILL HAVE A HUGE GROSS INCOME. WE ALSO HAVE HUGE EXPENSES. WHY AREN'T WE MORE AGGRESSIVE? WE NEED MORE FUNDRAISERS, SOMETHING TO GET OUR CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS UP. YOU'LL NOTE THAT ON PAGE 11, ANTHONY J. COSTALDO GAVE US TWO MILLION, MICHAEL FINETTI GAVE US 500,000. OVERALL OUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE UP 4%. BARELY INFLATION, BEN. WE SHOULD BE DOING MUCH BETTER. I, FOR ONE, WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHERE THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING. THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE EAST WING, AMONG OTHER THINGS. IT'S NOW ONE OF THE MOST TECHNICALLY ADVANCED... - SHOW US. - VERY WELL. WE'LL SET UP AN APPOINTMENT FOR, LET'S SAY... - 8:00 TOMORROW MORNING? - 8:00 TOMORROW MORNING. BERNICE, CANCEL MY 3:00 PROCTOLOGY APPOINTMENT. I THINK I JUST HAD IT. - Boy: PLEASE, IT'S JUST A DOG. - Nurse: I'M SORRY. HE'S MY FRIEND. HE'S MY ONLY FRIEND. HONEY, I'M SORRY, WE CAN'T HAVE HIM HERE. YOU HAVE TO TAKE THE DOG OUTSIDE. Boy: THERE'S NO ONE ELSE OUT THERE TO HELP ME. Nurse: WE DON'T HAVE THE MEANS TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR DOG. - THIS IS A HOSPITAL, ISN'T IT? - I'LL HANDLE THIS. - BUT... - DON'T EVEN SAY IT. - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? - HE'S GONNA DIE. TAKE IT EASY, JUST TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED. I WAS ON MY BIKE, RUSS WAS RUNNING ALONGSIDE, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE WAS GONE. HE MUST HAVE GOTTEN TOO FAR BEHIND ME. I HEARD THE BRAKES, AND THEN I SAW THIS CAR HIT HIM AND KEEP ON GOING. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM TO THE VET? I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY. PLEASE, YOU GOTTA HELP HIM. Doogie: DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD. CLEAN FRACTURE LINE RIGHT ACROSS THE NECK OF THE FEMUR. Jack: NEEDS A LITTLE REDUCTION, BUT THE FRAGMENTS ARE IN GOOD POSITION. YEAH, NO JOINT REPLACEMENT NECESSARY. IT COULD EASILY BE PINNED. HOW DID YOU GET THIS MUTT THROUGH X-RAY? HEAVY SEDATION. PLUS, CASMIR WAS ON DUTY. I HAD TO THROW IN A PAIR OF MY DAD'S LAKER TICKETS. - SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, DOOG? - RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT TO STABILIZE HIM, GET HIM OUT OF SHOCK. BUT IT'S A CLEAN BREAK, SHOULD BE EASY TO REPAIR. - WHO'S GONNA DO IT? - WE ARE. - WE? NOW HOLD IT. - WHAT ABOUT A VET? ARE YOU KIDDING? DO YOU KNOW WHAT A VET WOULD COST? SURGERY, BOARDING THE ANIMAL. WE'RE TALKING OVER $1,000. HOW ARE YOU GONNA GET A DOG INTO THE O.R.? NUMBER FOUR. THE WORKERS HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED THE OBSERVATION GALLERY, BUT THE ROOM IS TOTALLY FUNCTIONAL AND READY. WE'LL PROBABLY NEED SOME LIGHTS. AND MEYERS IS A DOG FREAK, I'M SURE WE CAN GET HIM TO DO THE ANESTHESIA. WITH YOU TWO ON BOARD, WE CAN BE IN AND OUT, HALF HOUR MAX. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DO THIS, DOOGIE. SHE'S RIGHT. DON'T EVEN ASK. FORGET IT. I'M NOT GOING TO SEND SIX YEARS OF WORK DOWN THE DRAIN FOR A MUTT WITH A BUSTED HIP. - WHAT? - SHH. JACK, CURLY, MEET RUSSELL. RUSSELL, THIS IS JACK, THIS IS CURLY. OHH. HI, BOY. I REALLY HATE YOU, DOOGIE. WHO CAN SAY NO TO THIS? Jack: THIS IS DIRTY POOL. I KNOW, BUT IT HAD TO BE DONE. YOU'RE GONNA OWE ME TILL GUAM LANDS A MAN ON THE MOON. I KNOW... OH. - UGH. - HONEY, YOU'RE A WONDERFUL SURGEON, BUT I'M GLAD NONE OF YOUR PATIENTS ARE FREE-RANGE CHICKENS. THEIR LITTLE JOINTS ARE PRETTY ORNERY. DAD, HAVE YOU EVER PERFORMED SURGERY ON AN ANIMAL? NO, SON, I HAVEN'T. - DID YOU EVER KNOW ANYBODY WHO DID? - CAN'T SAY I HAVE. WHAT ABOUT TED RAINEY? OH YES, TED RAINEY. TED RAINEY WAS A RADIOLOGIST I WENT TO MED SCHOOL WITH. - HE'S THE CHEAPEST S.O.B. I EVER MET. - DAVID. AND ARROGANT, TOO. ANYWAY... IT HAS TO BE AT LEAST 10 YEARS AGO, EASY, HIS LITTLE GIRL WANTED A PET CAT AND TED WAS TOO CHEAP TO BUY ONE. AND HER MOTHER TOOK HER DOWN TO THE POUND AND THEY PICKED OUT AN EIGHT-WEEK-OLD KITTY. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE LITTLE GIRL FALLS IN LOVE WITH THE KITTY, AND ALSO NEEDLESS TO SAY, 10 MONTHS LATER THE KITTY TURNS INTO A CAT AND GOES INTO HEAT. SHE HAD EVERY TOM IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WALKING A LITTLE SILLY, NOT TO MENTION THE HOWLINGS, KEEPING THE NEIGHBORS UP ALL NIGHT. SO, RATHER THAN SPEND THE 50 BUCKS TO GET THE CAT SPAYED, RAINEY DECIDES TO DO IT HIMSELF, AND HE GETS MARTY BEAMAN, WHO WAS AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST, TO HELP HIM OUT. AND ON SATURDAY MORNING, THEY GO INTO THE GARAGE AND THEY DO IT. - WHAT HAPPENED? - BEAMAN ODs THE CAT WITH TOO MUCH PENETHOL, KILLS IT. AND RAINEY'S KID STARTS TO CRY, DOESN'T STOP FOR TWO YEARS. COST HIM A FORTUNE IN SHRINK BILLS AND HIS WIFE DIVORCED HIM. LIGHT MEAT OR DARK, DEAR? - HOW'S THE PATIENT? - FINE. HOW YOU GUYS DOING? - FINE. - LOOKS GOOD. READY FOR THE KNOWLES PINS? HAND ME THE DRILL AND THE PIN. - HERE YOU ARE, DOCTOR. - STEADY HIM AND RETRACT A LITTLE BIT MORE. GOOD SHOT, IT CAME TOGETHER PERFECTLY. CAN YOU HAND ME THAT WRENCH, THE ONE WITH THE T-SHAPED HANDLE? HERE YOU GO. PERFECT, LIKE IT'D NEVER BEEN BROKEN. ONE MORE, AND WE CLOSE. ONCE COMPLETED, THE OPERATING ROOM WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH LAMINAR FLOW AIR CIRCULATION TO DECREASE THE CHANCE OF INFECTION. THE OPERATING ROOM LIGHTS WILL HAVE REMOTE CONTROL MOVEMENT AND FOCUSING RIGHT FROM THE FIELD. EVERYTHING, FROM PLANNING THROUGH FINAL CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT, COSTS ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS. WHAT'S THIS ALLOCATION OF $150,000 FOR AN O.R. GALLERY? UH, YES, SOMETHING I'M VERY PROUD OF. AND I KNOW YOU WILL BE, TOO. WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS. RIGHT THIS WAY. Mr. Kaya, please call security. Mr. Kaya, please call security. THIS PARTICULAR ROOM IS DESIGNED WITH AN OBSERVATION GALLERY, SO THAT IT CAN BE USED FOR TEACHING. WATCH YOUR STEP. THERE IS AN INTERCOM SYSTEM THAT ENABLES US TO COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY... DR. CANFIELD, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE'S A SURGERY GOING ON RIGHT NOW. I WASN'T AWARE THAT ANY SURGERIES WERE SCHEDULED IN HERE YET. HELLO DOWN THERE. THIS IS DR. CANFIELD. WHO ARE YOU, AND WHAT KIND OF SURGERY ARE YOU DOING? IT'S ME, DR. HOWSER, SIR. WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP A LITTLE MINOR SURGERY. WE HAD TO USE THIS FACILITY. EVERYTHING ELSE IS BACKED UP. OH, BY THE WAY, IT'S A BEAUTY. IT'S REALLY, REALLY VERY NICE. DR. HOWSER... IS THAT A DOG? OH. YES. YES, I BELIEVE IT IS, SIR. HOWSER... THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE WORST VIOLATION OF HOSPITAL POLICY THAT I'VE EVER SEEN HERE AT EASTMAN. NOT ONLY DID YOU PERFORM SURGERY ON A CANINE IN AN OPERATING ROOM, BUT YOU COERCED OTHER DOCTORS INTO ASSISTING YOU. I TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. I WANT THE NAMES OF YOUR CO-CONSPIRATORS, DOUGLAS. NO WAY, I CAN'T DO THAT. YOU CAN FIRE ME BEFORE I DO THAT. FIRING YOU ISN'T EVEN AN ISSUE HERE. I TRIED TO TALK THEM OUT OF IT BECAUSE OF MY FONDNESS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. BUT THE BOARD HAS OFFICIALLY SUSPENDED YOU. AS OF THIS MOMENT, YOU ARE OUT OF HERE. BUT... I... I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP THIS KID OUT. I WAS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING HUMANE, SOMETHING I SEE FAR TOO LITTLE OF AROUND HERE. WE'RE TURNING AWAY PEOPLE WHO NEED MEDICAL HELP JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE HOMELESS. SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT THAT. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THAT. BUT THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM DOESN'T LIE IN PERFORMING COVERT SURGERY ON A CANINE. WHERE'S THE DOG NOW? IN RECOVERY. I WANT IT OUT OF HERE WITHIN 24 HOURS. DOUGLAS. I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET YOU REINSTATED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. BUT DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. THANKS. THIS IS A HUMONGOUS ZIT. MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN A ZIT. IT COULD BE A VOLCANO. I THINK I GOT IT. THERE, LOOKS LIKE I GOT IT ALL. - YOU ARE DEPRESSED. - VINNIE, I WAS FIRED. THIS IS MY LIFE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, MY CAREER. - I LOVE MY WORK. - THERE ARE PLENTY OF HOSPITALS OUT THERE. NONE THAT ARE GONNA WANT A DOCTOR WHO GOT FIRED AT THE AGE OF 16 FOR OPERATING ON A DOG. DON'T WORRY. THEY'LL ASK YOU BACK. THESE PEOPLE I'M DEALING WITH ARE A PRETTY HEARTLESS GROUP. YOU GOTTA APPEAL TO THEIR COMPASSION. THIS IS A DOG. MAN'S BEST FRIEND. PART OF AMERICANA. I MEAN, WHO BARKS AT OUR BURGLARS? WHO BRINGS US OUR NEWSPAPERS? WHO TREES OUR CATS? THE DOG. CANINE AMERICANUS. VINNIE, I'M NOT EVEN GONNA GET A CHANCE TO APPEAL. MAYBE YOU CAN TELL THEM IT WAS A MISTAKE. YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A MIDGET WITH A HORMONE PROBLEM. YOU'RE DEAD, AREN'T YOU? NO, RIGHT NOW I'M JUST FIRED. BUT WHEN MY FATHER GETS HOME, THEN I'M GONNA BE DEAD. YOUR MOTHER TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED, DOUGLAS. DAD, I'M SORRY. I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU'VE SACRIFICED FOR ME... AND I KNOW HOW MUCH MY SUCCESS MEANS TO YOU BOTH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. DOUGLAS, YOUR MOTHER AND I SOMETIMES TAKE ISSUE WITH YOUR IMPETUOUSNESS, BUT WE SUPPORT YOUR HUMANITY AND YOUR INSTINCTS TO DO GOOD. YOU CAN TEACH SOMEBODY MEDICINE. BUT YOU CAN'T TEACH SOMEBODY COMPASSION. AND YOU'VE GOT THAT IN SPADES, DOOGIE. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF YOU. THANKS, MOM. THANKS, DAD. IF EASTMAN MEDICAL DOESN'T TAKE YOU BACK, I WOULDN'T WORRY. THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM ON THE SHINGLE FOR HOWSER & SON. YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT. AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK OUT, YOU CAN ALWAYS BE A VETERINARIAN. PUT ONE OF THESE IN HIS FOOD THREE TIMES A DAY. KEEP HIM RESTED FOR ANOTHER WEEK, HE SHOULD BE UP AND MOVING SOON. AND HE CAN'T CHASE CARS FOR ANOTHER 27 YEARS. - THANKS, DR. HOWSER. - HEY, IT'S DOOGIE TO YOU. - AND YOU BETTER THANK THESE PEOPLE TOO. - THANKS. FROM RUSSELL TOO. - NO PROBLEM. - LOOK AT THAT. - WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU. - OKAY. HANG IN THERE, GUY. THIS WILL BLOW OVER, YOU'LL BE BACK REAL SOON. DOOGIE, NOW WHO'S GONNA FINISH MY DESSERTS? KEEP IN TOUCH. I MEAN IT. COME ON, BILLY, I'LL WALK YOU OUT. - SEE YOU. - BYE. SO LONG. Vinnie: I'M TELLING YOU, HE SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE. THERE'S HOWSER. THERE'S THE KID, THERE'S THE DOG AND THERE'S YOUR PULITZER PRIZE. Man #1: Let's do this. Man #2: Yeah. DR. HOWSER. JANET FELDER, K.T.D.E. NEWS. - VINNIE, WHAT IS THIS? - DON'T WORRY, JUST BE YOURSELF. WE'D LIKE TO INTERVIEW YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU DID FOR THIS BOY AND HIS DOG. - I DON'T KNOW, I... - GO ON. I GUESS IT'S ALL RIGHT. - LET'S ROLL, STU. - AND... GO. THIS IS JANET FELDER OUTSIDE EASTMAN MEDICAL. WE'RE STANDING HERE WITH 16-YEAR-OLD DR. DOUGLAS HOWSER. YOU MAY REMEMBER HIM FROM A FEATURE STORY WE DID WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO THIS FACILITY IN SEPTEMBER OF 1988. IS IT TRUE, DR. HOWSER, THAT YOU'VE JUST BEEN RELIEVED OF YOUR DUTIES? - YES. - TELL US WHY. I PERFORMED A SURGICAL PROCEDURE ON BILLY'S DOG IN VIOLATION OF HOSPITAL POLICY. - WHAT'S THE DOG'S NAME, SON? - RUSSELL. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM, BILLY? HE GOT CRUNCHED BY A CAR. DOOGIE FIXED HIS LEG. WHY DID YOU BRING HIM TO EASTMAN MEDICAL CENTER? 'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY TO TAKE HIM TO THE VET. - HOW'S RUSSELL NOW? - GOOD. DOOGIE SAYS HE'LL BE WALKING IN A WEEK. I JUST HOPE DOOGIE GETS HIS JOB BACK. THERE YOU HAVE IT. A BOY AND HIS DOG, A YOUNG DOCTOR WITH A BIG HEART. WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY UNFOLD. THAT'S IT. KIDS AND DOGS, DOCTOR HOWSER, THEY'RE IRRESISTIBLE. WHEN THIS HITS THE EVENING NEWS, TAKE MY WORD FOR IT, YOU'RE GONNA BE A HERO. THANKS, BILLY. - VINNIE, WHAT WAS ALL THIS? - SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE, MAN. THE MESSAGE IS THE MEDIA. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY ATTENDANT TO THIS LITTLE ESCAPADE OF YOURS HAS GOTTEN OUT OF HAND, DR. HOWSER. THE SWITCHBOARDS ARE JAMMED. SOME OF OUR LARGER CONTRIBUTORS HAVE THREATENED TO TAKE THEIR FUNDS ELSEWHERE. SO... NOTWITHSTANDING OUR COMPLETE DISAPPROVAL OF YOUR BEHAVIOR, WE'RE PREPARED TO OFFER YOU A SECOND CHANCE. - THANK YOU. - THERE ARE CONDITIONS. ABSOLUTE COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES AND POLICIES OF THIS HOSPITAL. NO MORE INTERVIEWS WITH THE PRESS. WE WILL ISSUE A JOINT STATEMENT ABOUT THE CONCLUSION OF THIS INCIDENT. JUST SIGN THIS. HAVE AN END TO THE MATTER. DO YOU HAVE A PEN? I DON'T THINK SO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU DON'T THINK SO? I'M NOT SURE I WANT TO WORK IN A HOSPITAL THAT HAS NO COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE UNLESS THEY CAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR IT. THIS HOSPITAL CANNOT BE IN THE BUSINESS OF EXTENDING COMPASSION TO EVERY STRAY DOG AND KID. YES, BUT IT DOESN'T EXTEND ITS COMPASSION TO THE SICK, HOMELESS PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN TURNING AWAY EITHER. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WE'VE GOT TO DRAW THE LINE SOMEWHERE. WE'RE NOT A FREE CLINIC. WE'RE BARELY IN THE BLACK AS IT IS. YOUNG MAN, ARE YOU GOING TO SIGN THIS OR NOT? - NO. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'VE GOT TO RETURN TED KOPPEL'S PHONE CALL. WAIT A MOMENT. WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO KEEP YOU HERE? GEE, I DON'T KNOW. - A MILLION DOLLARS. - ARE YOU JOKING? NO, SIR. I THINK WITH A MILLION DOLLARS WE CAN PROBABLY SET UP A PRETTY GOOD TREATMENT FUND FOR THE HOMELESS. ALL RIGHT. Woman: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? WE'LL FIND THE MONEY SOMEWHERE. BUT REMEMBER, IT'S FOR CREATURES THAT WALK UPRIGHT. ARE WE AGREED? YES, SIR. YES, SIR. WELCOME BACK, DR. HOWSER. THANK YOU, SIR. - HI, VINNIE. - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? TURN THAT OFF. - AND TURN THIS ON. - WHY? I'M ON THE NEWS, MAN. THEY INTERVIEWED ME, AND I WAS TERRIFIC. IT'S GONNA DO WONDERS FOR MY LOVE LIFE. - I OWE IT ALL TO YOU, PAL. - NO, I OWE IT ALL TO YOU. IF YOU HADN'T DONE WHAT YOU DID, I WOULDN'T BE AT EASTMAN NOW. YOU'RE THE BEST FRIEND A GUY COULD EVER HAVE. LET'S FORGET FRIENDS AND WHO OWES WHAT TO WHO. HERE IT IS. Reporter: At 7:00 p.m. this evening, a joint statement was issued by Eastman Medical Center stating that Dr. Douglas Howser has been reinstated and that a new fund has been set up, establishing emergency medical care for the homeless. Standing next to me is Vincent Delpino, the young man who brought Dr. Howser's plight to our attention. Thank you, Janet. And thank you for calling me a man. Reporter: Vincent, you must feel very proud of what you did - and what the final outcome was. - That I do, Janet. I did not want this community to lose the genius qualities of my best friend. He's brilliant and also very passionate about medicine. That's something for a 16-year-old. Usually they're just passionate. Believe me, I know. I'm sure this community owes you a debt of gratitude. This is Janet Felder, reporting from Eastman Medical Center... You're a very beautiful woman, Miss Felder. Well... thank... Sorry, back to you, Don and Ed. A GUY'S GOTTA DO WHAT A GUY'S GOTTA DO. - AND YOU DID IT. - I'D LOVE TO STAY AND CHAT, BUT I CAN HEAR MY PHONE RINGING OFF THE HOOK EVEN AS WE SPEAK. NOW THAT I'M A MEDIA PERSONALITY, WOMEN ARE BREAKING THEIR FINGERNAILS DIALING THE PHONE. THIS IS VINNIE DELPINO. GOOD NIGHT.
