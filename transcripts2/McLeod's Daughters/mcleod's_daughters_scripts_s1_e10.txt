 - Made the place look good. (laughs) Now, that looks familiar. (laughs) (soft music) - Jeez. (glass shattering) - Handling better, eh? - Yeah. Those tires must have cost a fortune. The bill gonna scare me a bit? - No, I picked them up last night from a bloke who owes me. - Hmm.

 Well now. Wonder how we missed that. - Dead awhile. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. That must be the orphan. (sheep baaing) (laughs) - Tough little bugger. Last without his mom for a couple of days. - Poddy lamb worth the trouble? - It's all money. But a hand feeding is good for the soul. - Yeah? - At least they've got good sense to be cute. (sheep baas) (soft music) - Yeah yeah, it's coming. You like it mutton temperature. (sheep baas) Couldn't you go outside and do that? (soft music) Oh, I know.

Track around for the rest of my stuff. And Mom's stuff, too. - Just the one truck, was it? - I believe that Indian wooden couch thing used to be over there in its day. - It's back home then. (sneezes) Hey, look at this. Mom bought this in Bali. Jodi, I was with her. (sneezes) - What are these? - Ah, they're Mom's tarot cards. Yep, she was into those for awhile. - It's funny seeing all this stuff around the place again. - This is so gross. (laughs) - It's Taffy. I can't believe she had it stuffed. - Yep, Mom was funny about that cat. She had to have him around, even after he died. - I remember Taffy. Always sleeping around the place. - Always making my life misery. That animal knew that I was aller-- (sneezes) - Bless you. - Okay Tess, that cat goes. - Hey, Tess. What's this? - Oh. That's Mom. It's no big deal, guys, it's just ashes. Where shall I put her? Ah, mantelpiece. - Actually. - Maybe the study then. She can commune with Jack. - Maybe we should get some work done. - [Tess] Great gadget. Little merry-go-round for lambs, is it? - Becky puts them in the cradle. Then round to Meg for vaccination. (sheep baaing) Then round to me for docking. - How cruel is that? - It's more cruel to leave the tails on. There's a full blown corpse out there I can show you. - Yeah I know, maggots and stuff. It's still mutilation. You know, English lambs get to keep their tails. - They don't have 20 billion blowies keeping them company. - Tess, gonna give us a hand? - That's a story. - Becky's doing the castration. I'm in the mood. - You know, the septic tank's still blocked. I think I might climb up there and get that fixed up this afternoon. Okay, I'll see you later. - You have all the fun. We'll manage. - [Meg] Can we all stop rummaging through junk and concentrate on dinner now? - What about this lettuce centrifuge? You get very dry, very crisp lettuce. - Thank you, but no thanks. - Is this box to keep or go to the op shop? - Ah yep, op shop. - This one? - Yep. Oh Becky, full length mirror. It's yours if you want it. - Oh, that's good. - [Meg] Come on, Jodi, clear a space. - The Empress. Does that mean anything to you, Tess? - I'm not sure, they were Mom's. Only the owner's supposed to touch them. - Oh, sorry. - Oh, it's okay. Mom's gone, cards chose you. That's the way they work. - Hmm, thanks. - You know, we could take all this junk into town tomorrow because I've still gotta get some vaccines for the lambs. - Well, if you want, we can chop it all up with an ax right now. - No no, tomorrow's fine. - And I assume that cat is in the first box out of here? - Meg, waffle maker. I reckon you'd be really good at making waffles. - You're not eating with us, Becky? - No, I'm not hungry, ta. (soft music) - Thought you might like this. Be an extra light. You feeling all right? - Yeah, never better. - Notice you're off your food. And you didn't have a beer after work. - Ah, better watch my weight, beer's fattening. - Yeah, you wouldn't want to get a tummy. - I was thinking I might turn in now. - Becky, if you're pregnant-- - Thanks for the lamp. - At least test yourself. Then you know. (soft music) I'm assuming Taffy's on board. I haven't seen him go in. - Yep, he's around somewhere. - We should be back by lunchtime. If you could do the oil change on the tractor would be good. - Do you want to muster the rest of the ewes this afternoon? - No no, just keep up the work of the first lot, okay? - Okay. Hey Tess, can you grab me something in town today? - Sure, more chocolate? Oh. What makes you think you're pregnant? - Usual signs. Can't seem to get away from Brian, can I? - I'm sorry, Becky, it shouldn't be this way. - It's not the kid's fault the father's a bastard. - Yeah and what about you? - I have work to do. Between you and I, okay? - Yep. - [Becky] Oh, would you just get lost? (sheep baas) (sneezes) - It still can't be the cat, Mom. Nobody's that allergic. - Ruth knew what that animal did to me. I think she encouraged her to drop fur all over the place. - Yeah, but Taffy's stuffed, okay? His molting days are over. (sneezes) And he's on his way to Gungellan now, okay? It's just the dust setting you off. - Well, there's plenty of that around with Ruth's stuff everywhere. It's like she's moved back in. - [Jodi] Oh death, gross. - That is a whole lot of nonsense. Now would you just eat your breakfast? (sneezes) (upbeat music) - The op shop will freak. Not every day they get a load of Gamelan drumsticks and genuine Turkish pewter pots. - Hmm. - Must be hard letting go of all that stuff. Lots of memories. - What do you think about abortion, Claire? - Sorry? - Yep, it's complicated. (eerie music) - You okay? - Yep. (eerie music) Should we get them out? (intense music) - It's okay, it's okay. - I don't know if he's still breathing. - First aid kit, Tess, from the ute. - First aid, look at these people. (intense music) - He's alive. Gashed his leg. - There's a lot of blood, okay, what do we do? Tourniquet? - No, no, no, pressure. Hold a bandage, push it down. - [Cassie] Help me. - It's all right, it's all right. (groans) It's okay, we'll get help. - Jodi, you've had an hour. Have you found the problem, or is the answer in the cards? - I don't know. It was pretty filthy, I couldn't work it out. - You've been fixing pumps for years. - And loving it. - Look, the impeller's worn. You could try replacing it. - Yeah, sure. - Stop playing patience and get on with it. - Where's the pain? - Chest. Geoffrey. - He's okay, Geoffrey's okay. Just try to stay calm. (groans) - We're gonna have to move him. - I don't think we're supposed to. - Claire, I'm standing in petrol here. There is a lot of petrol. - Okay, we're just gonna help Geoffrey now, but we're still here. You're in first, eh? - Yeah. - Come here. Okay, one, two, three. - Three. All right, go slow, go slow. Okay, down here. On his back? - Yeah, I suppose. That's good. Good mate, you okay? - Should we put something under his head? - No, I don't think so. - What about the driver? - She's jammed under the steering wheel. We're gonna need help. - Okay, I'll call an ambulance. I'll get Meg and I'll be straight back. - [Claire] It's okay, mate. We're gonna get you some help. - Come on. Claire, something's wrong. - [Claire] What is it? - It's not moving, we did something. - It's the tail shaft, I felt it go. What are we gonna do now? - Well, we passed the Killarney turnoff not far back. - It's our best chance. - I'll do it. - It's a fair run, Tess. - I'll try it. I'll cut across the paddock, yep? (eerie music) - Geoffrey? Geoffrey. Geoffrey. - He's all right, he's all right. We just got him out of the car. Help's on its way. (eerie music) - Ow! - What happened? - You had a car accident. No, no, stay still, stay still. I'm here, I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here. (eerie music) - My car. Have I wrecked my car? - Yeah, you have. But you're gonna be fine. - Need the car. Going to Sydney. So stupid. Gotta see my sister. She'll think I'm not coming. - She'll understand, don't you worry about that. (soft music) (knocking) - Help, someone please. Hello? - What are you doing? - I need an ambulance. There's been a car accident, it's urgent. - Wait there, I'll get Harry. - Gungellan Road. No, no, no, 20 kilometers south about. - Haven't seen my sis for years. - You'll get to Sydney, just be a bit late. - She's getting married. Have to go. Three days. Do you think I'll make it? - You'll see her soon and she'll be so happy. - My little sis. I won't be there. Don't, don't, don't stuff her wedding day. - No, she'll want to know that you're all right. - You can say I love her. - She knows that, she does. - We have bandages to soak up the blood, but that's about it. And the woman, she was crying but, well, there was no way we could get her out. - We've got bolt cutters in the back. We might be lucky. - I've called an ambulance, they're on their way. Those jaws of life things, they have those, don't they? - Yeah, the ambulance is two hours away. I've got Alex taking the chopper. - We moved him, we couldn't tell, but we had to move him. - Tess! You're out on your feet, just stay here. - They're still out there, I have to go. - Get some water or she'll be in hospital soon. - All right, yeah. (soft music) - Our neighbors are coming and they have helicopter. Geoffrey's doing okay. Hey, there'll be an ambulance too. You just hang in there. - What if something happens? My sister. - Sorry, you said? (soft music) No, no, you stay with me. (groans) Bugger these things. No, please God. Come on, come on.

(muffled chatting) - You guys okay? - [Tess] We're fine. - You did a great job, Claire. - I know. - [Nick] So come away now, sit down for awhile. - I promised her I'd stay with her. - Yep, Alex, we need to immobilize his neck just to be safe. - Use a towel to wrap around his neck? - Sounds good. - I don't remember-- - He's conscious now. - It's all right, mate, just relax. It's okay, relax. - [Harry] They want him in, Alex. Let's get him in now. - My wife, my wife, my wife. My wife, my wife. - It's all right, mate.

Go and bugger up Meg's veggie patch or something. - You're stuck with it. He thinks you're mom. - Great, just what I need. - That's the thing. They're always hungry, always yelling for something. It's a full time job. - Jodi turned out okay. - Jodi won't mix sheep dip because it stains her fingernails. Yeah, she's great. - I mean, it must've been hard on your own. - Yes. I had help, you would too. - Yeah but it'd be me up all night with the kid hanging off my head. It'd be me trying to work and raise a baby at the same time. - [Meg] Yeah, but you wouldn't be the first to have to do that. - Take a look around, Meg. Crap parents have crap kids. - Nice positive start. Put that motto in your baby book. - Would you go away? (sheep baas) (sneezes) - I finished fixing the pumps. Do you want to make some sandwiches now? - Yep, might as well. - Okay, can you pick a card, any card? This is absolutely the last time, I promise. Okay, is it a skeleton guy in a cloak holding a scythe thing? - No. The Hanged Man. Charming, might need to work on that trick. (sneezes) Won't be able to set foot in here soon. Just the way Ruth would've wanted it. - You hated Ruth's guts, didn't you? - Well, hate is a very strong word. But there was a personality clash. - That's okay if you didn't get on, it happens. - Ruth didn't even try. She disliked the bush. Never understood it, never fitted in. - Well at least Tess is trying. - Oh, gosh yes. Tess is light years ahead of her mother. The little bitch. - Tess or Ruth? - Right now, I can't tell the difference. She promised me. (soft music) What happened? - Man and a woman hit a tree. It was pretty bad. We skidded. Hey Beck, those new tires saved us. - Are you both okay? - Yeah, Claire was amazing. Stayed with them the whole time. But the woman died. - I knew something was gonna happen, Tess. I think I saw it. - Come on, I'll put the kettle on. - Hey, Tess. You should get those feet in some ice water. Helps with the swelling. - I'm okay. Maybe I'll have something to eat. While I'm having a bath. That's always good for stress. - You know, I think I saw it, Tess. In the tarot. - Don't start that again. - Well, I turned over the card like, twice. It must've been a warning. - Actually, I used to play with those cards quite a lot. I'd build houses with them when it was raining. - I'm not gonna look at them again. If I turn up the death card again, I'm just gonna freak. - Maybe I'll check the web later, Jod. There's probably a first aid course we could do online. - Well, we're done. You can put your feet up for awhile. - Not me. Still got ewes to muster. - I can give you a hand with that. - Tess'll do it with me. Meg can go get the vaccine. She can use Jack's merch. Becky will fix the ute, think we're set. - Okay, if you're set. - Here I'm kicking you out. You want some lunch? - No, no, better get back to Dad. Ambulance will be there any minute. - Right, thanks. - Hey, look. You probably saved that guy's life. And the woman, well-- - I know, nothing we could do. (groans) (soft music) Can you do a run into town, Meg? - Of course, this afternoon? - As soon as. If you can help Becky with the ute, Jodi. Think that's a priority. - Sure. - Tess, when you're ready, we'll muster. - Are you sure, Claire? It's been a tough day already. - Oh, I'm fine. - I thought I'd have a bath first. - Just make it a shower. See you out there. - Will she put some clothes on first? (soft music) - Mom? I miss you. (sheep baaing) (dog barking) (soft music) (sheep baas) - Can I get you anything in town? - No. - You can buy me a magazine. - How's the ute? - Pretty stuffed. - I can put a weld on it. It'll hold until we get it to a mechanic. You okay? - Oh, I lost it there for a minute, but I am off to do some work. - Never stops. (sheep baaing) - Let them out, boy. (sheep baaing) - How you doing? - Yeah, fine. Just make sure they stay out of the creek, okay? - Yep. (soft music) - Well, that makes more sense. The death card doesn't mean death. - Can you pass me the other wrench? Oh, I'm sick of this animal. I'm gonna put you in the laundry. You realize you get fed so you taste better? Do you understand that? Come on. - The death card's about completing a chapter. Closing a door on something or accepting the inevitable. Huh, maybe that's me, stuck here. (soft music) - Young Jodi, isn't it? - Can I help you with something? - I've got a bit of a problem with some tires. Wheels, actually. Some brand new wheels off a brand new ute. - I don't know anything about it. - Well, look at these. Brand new wheels on your ute. You don't know where these came from? - That's bull. - You didn't help her, did you? Didn't help her steal them? I mean, your mom would really love that joke. - What are you talking about? - Look, I've come all the way out here. I'm not going back without them. You got a jack? - You can't just take our tires. Look, I don't know what this is about, but you have to wait for Claire. - Is she off somewhere? - They all are. So come back another time, all right? - No, I think I'll wait. Have a look around. See if something else of mine turns up. - No! I think you'd better leave. - What's the problem? - Brian? She said leave. I think you should listen. (eerie music) (yelling) (sheep baaing) (eerie music) (yells) - You all right, Claire? - Yeah. - Come on. - Becky, this is so not worth it, okay? It's over a few tires. - Jodi, he raped me. Anything I do to him won't be enough. - What, him? This guy? - You're a bloody thief. Where's my stuff? You've been ripping me off blind. - You dropped me behind a bar and pushed my head into a fridge. - Bullshit. - Don't, Beck. - Go inside, Jodi. - It's not worth it, you'll go to jail. - Should've stayed away, I was doing all right. - You don't know one end of a gun from another. (gunshot) Jesus. - I'll muddle through. - All right, Becky, put the gun down now. Please, okay-- - No way. - Look, he'll go, he won't come back, will you? - He'll come back with the police. - I bloody well should. - Bring them and I'll tell them what you did to me that night. - You wanted it. - I said no, you've heard the word before, Brian. - But you're always looking for it. - Look at yourself. You're old and you're ugly. Why would I bother? - You little bitch. You share it around with everybody else. What's wrong with me? - Jodi, you're my witness. Now get the cops out here now. - What, with a pointed gun at me? You think that's gonna stand up in court? Jesus, Becky. People know what you are. You're gonna make a bigger fool of yourself over a harmless little grope behind the bar? - No, Becky! (gunshot) - Jesus Christ. You little bitch. - [Jodi] Here. - Get away from me, both of you. You tried to kill me. - If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead. - Well, let's get cops out here. - Sure, what will you tell the cops? About the rape? Your wife and children will find out about it. - Who's gonna believe you? - We'll see. You still got off lighter than me. - We could've been digging his grave by now and dumping his body and telling crappy lies and we still would've gone to jail anyway. - He won't tell. - You're gonna be in heaps of trouble, Becky. He's gonna sack you. (soft music) Why didn't you tell me, Beck? - Because I couldn't, Jod. It's okay. - There's some blood here. If I wash it away-- - I should clean the rifle. Claire will smell if it's been fired. - So, clean the rifle. (soft music) - It'll be all right. Time of the month, sorry. A snake, I shot it. Round near the back then. - Good. - I'll just put it away then. - Help. (soft music) - Come on, Jodi, everyone's back. Work to do. Now, please. - Can I just have a minute? - Is something wrong? - No. I'm coming. Mom. Do you know who attacked Becky? Because I think it was Brian. From the hotel. - Is that what Becky said? Look, I've known Brian for years. He's a good bloke. It couldn't have been Brian. (soft music) So how you feeling? - Pretty good. Dealing with it, you know? - Right, you have to let go, don't you? - That's exactly right. You sound just like my mom. - I was wondering then about Taffy. Come on, Tess, you have to let go. - Yeah, but he belonged to Mom. - Yeah look, I can live with Ruth's damn Indian couch thing, but I can't live with her damn cat. (sheep baaing) They're talking about the accident in town, by the way. Same bit of road Fergusons rolled on last year. And that bloke you helped? - Geoffrey. - He's doing okay in the hospital. He's got a broken arm, punctured lung, spleen damage-- - Thanks, Meg. (eerie music) - You okay, Claire? - We can knock this over in the morning, couldn't we? I'll help too. - No, we're set now. - You've been pushing yourself too hard. You should stop. - It's how you get the work done. - Cassie, that was her name. The woman that died. Cassie Trinder. (eerie music) - Damn it. - Here, let me see, is it deep? - I didn't ask her name. I didn't think to ask. - [Tess] It's okay. (soft music) - The more you walk, the thinner you stay, the longer you live, you understand that? Come on. - Becky. Got you a present in town. I was bold as you like, I just, they'll get the rumors started. - Like there aren't enough already, Meg. - You have to know. - I do know, thanks. Better late than never? - Oh, thank God for that. - Come on. - Awful, in front of everyone like that. I think I've lost it completely. - Right, bosses don't cry, is that it? - I should be able to handle this stuff. - So handle it in a healthy way. Don't bottle things up. Works for me. Mostly. Ruth loved you, Taffy. And that made you a very lucky cat. (sneezes) And I'm sorry I dusted the side board with your face that time after you were stuffed. (soft music) - [Everyone] Bye, Taffy. - Yeah, bye Taffy. - Remember, Meg. Nine lives, still eight to go. (soft music) - Way too weird.
