 'Ian, are you there?' Having a domestic? He arranged her birthday party, had a proposal all lined up, the ring twinkling on a velvet cushion, and she stood him up. What do you think? I need to tell you something. Hey, you're going to get flattened. What on earth are you doing here? She died. I gave her all we had. I couldn't bear the thought of dying before her. 'I'm doing it all on my own, and it's my own free will.' Did you pull?

 No! She so did! Paula got wasted at my party. You told me it was someone I didn't know. You absolute bastard! You give me my key, give me my key. Give me my key! You engineered her death. No. And don't think this is the end of it. But if the CPS are not prosecuting... For you. Don't think it's the end of it for you. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. I think that's it, actually. No, there's a police uniform. The protons bombard the tumour

 and the surrounding tissue is unaffected. This treatment is targeted and precise. And unavailable in the UK? We are getting the machines but Robbie needs treatment now. He'll complete his course of chemotherapy and then head to the States for the proton therapy. I nursed a little girl with the same thing last year. She's doing well. Real little live wire. Like our Robbie. He's a comedian, always in trouble. I saw him on the ward, driving everyone nuts. He couldn't eat his breakfast this morning, he's desperate to leave. Quite right. You get him home, I'll soon break his spirit. Nursing, is it a popularity contest? Discuss. I'm sorry, I know you and I have a different approach to care. Mine being to protect and preserve life. This is Liana Corden again, isn't it? A woman is dead who should be alive. And it's down to you. Charm your way out of that one, if you can. Oh, Hope! Good luck in the maths test. It's not a test, um, it's an experiment in probability. How's that going to get you to a good university? Bye! You all right? Hope! Hope! Do you remember what we said? Don't hang around with just anyone. OK. Bye. Richie, wait. OT's arranged for handles in the bathroom. So when did she have the stroke? Two weeks ago so I doubt they've been yet. Who's in the disabled parking? The new bloke will be here any minute. Is that you, Paula? No! I never park in... Yeah, you do. And you use disabled loos, shameless. We should put a note on the windscreen, because we want to make Matthew feel welcome. Look, I've brought him this. In case he gets hungry? Well, he's stuck inside four walls all day. I just thought he'd appreciate it. You all right? You're going to assess your new stroke patient, yes? Yeah. She's only been in hospital a fortnight, they've managed to give her a sore arse already. Modern nurses. They're a joke. Spat out of university with no more of an idea of what a nurse is than that awful triffid-looking thing. Morning, Matt. This is Matthew Seren, everyone. Our new administrator, co-ordinator and receptionist. Some bastard is parked in my space. I'll sodding do 'em. 'Hello?' Oh. Hello. Well, no need to sound so surprised. It's you ringing me. Yeah, I know. You've not been answering. I thought I was going to have to leave another message. I'm at work, Ian. If you could just say whatever it is you want. Well, it's my things. You've got my stuff. By the back door. Any problems, pick up the phone. Some things in here you don't need to worry about, we'll give them if they are needed. There's just so much to take in. It's only been a couple of weeks since the diagnosis. Give yourselves some time. Here you go. The best recovery rate is for children under the age of ten. That's Robbie. And where there's no metastases, that's another tick. And you got it early. Tick number three. A lorra, lorra ticks. The drug box. All yours. I'll get it! Hold on. Hi. Sorry. It's my housework. Twinned with Beirut, disaster zone. I'm Andy Peat. Your district nurse. Blimey. Yeah, um, right, come on in, come on in. Just, er, kick some of that stuff out the... How many pairs of shoes do two children need? What's this? We made them. What's in them? Lime, blackcurrant and soda. If this doesn't make you miss hospital tea, then nothing will. Dad! It's nice, it's like... District nurse, love. Hiya, I'm Andy. Well, suddenly things are looking up! Zoom! So, this proton machine... They'll shoot me with the protons. Zap, zap, zap! That's so scary. There's this laser thing, you get a red spot, you're the target, see. Ah, right. That's my lump. They'll shine this laser on it and it'll go, "Oh, no!" And phut! Zapped. I'm your tumour, aargh, you've got me! Richie! Oh, hi, Hope! Hey, Frankie. Do you fancy a lift home? I've got the car, going right past your house. Um, no, thanks. Hey, do you fancy bowling again next week, I'll set it up with your mum? That's all I need. If she says I was with you lot. So, Hope, fancy going bowling? Shut up. She's OK. She's a laugh. How much information do we need on the Black Death, anyway? You don't have to, you know. What? We all know how hard it is being the new kid on the block. You don't have to try so hard. For that, I am going to make you a Matt Seren special cup of coffee. Hi. Is Frankie around? It's only Dr Evans who's complaining, not her partners. But I haven't done anything wrong. She's concerned, and she has a responsibility to her patients. Hang on, hang on, I have a responsibility to my patients, too. And as your manager, I can't ignore this. OK. You enabled Liana Corden to stay at home rather than go into a hospice, which in turn enabled her husband to assist in his wife's suicide. I can understand why she wants someone to look at what happened. So you need to look at your notes, from day one when you met the patient, and you need to write them up, in report form. Frankie? We need to knock this on the head before it goes any further. I can't believe Zoe Evans is getting other people involved. You know, I'm going to... I'm going to talk to her. Not a great idea. Just get your head down and write the report. You, um, really like that colour? It's all right. What's wrong with it? Nursing-home green. Hmm, lovely. What's this? Don't touch it. It's wet. There's wine in the fridge. Is that shirt Ian's? You'll mess it up. Idiot. Write the damn report. What do you think you're playing at? Lawn tennis? My stuff, left out in all weathers for anyone to take. You got it, then? Not my laptop. Perhaps it was there. Perhaps it was nicked. Well, was it? No. It's in the house. Oh, at least you've got a conscience about something. Excuse me! You are in no position to talk to me about conscience, all right? Oh, change the song. It happened. Forgive me or don't. Up to you. Oh, so you can shag for England and I, I have to make allowances for this. No, no, no, no-one's making you. It's your choice but either way, I can't just keep on and on apologising. I'm not asking you to! I'm not asking you to! I'm just, you know, stay away from me, that's all I ask. Don't worry, just give me my stuff back and I'll leave you in peace. Yeah, of course you will, because you'll be too busy playing happy-ever-after with bloody Paula. Who are you waiting for? None of your business. If it's Dr Evans, you just missed her. Right, thanks for saying. I don't think he needs any encouragement. You do know that you're breaking the law? The no mayonnaise law? I think you'll find that's chips related. Paula. You're ten minutes late, but I forgive you. We have to talk, don't we? We can't avoid everything for ever. We've done... Well, yeah, you could say we've done something wrong. You know we have. Well, what are you drinking? Um, I'll have a pint, please. Of course, sir. Mum and Dad are in Spain so... I'm all alone. Bit spooky. Burglars and that. Still, being a policeman, bet nothing frightens you, does it? Only Frankie. Ange. Hi. You know how good you are at writing reports? Yeah, you are. How about a sort of tutorial down at the Dancing Ferret? ♪ Why do you build me up ♪ Buttercup baby ♪ Just to let me down... ♪ She's got a report to write. Shall we get her home? Us and whose army? ♪ You never call, baby ♪ When you say you will ♪ I love you still... ♪ Sorry, mate, can I just move you in a bit? Oh, might have known. Watch your backs there, mate. Is that...? Aye, the new bloke. Right, who's drinking what? It's my round. Matt, this is Angie. Hi. How's the job? Bottle it and you could do away with Valium. Here we go... "District nurses, talk about disorganised." Truth hurts, see? Your schedules are rubbish. No, they're worked out to cut down on travelling time and mileage. You're joking? Let me loose with a map and I'll soon have you organised. It's not astrophysics, is it? ♪ Baby, baby... ♪ Bottle for Andy and wine for...? Angie. Angie. 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me! Would someone like to move their arse, please? Another great addition to the team. ♪ Why do you build me up? ♪ Buttercup baby ♪ Just to let me down? ♪ And mess me around... ♪ The end of another exciting night. Cold, tired, fed up. Where've they got to? Stick your optics, then, you ugly, fat gits. In Afghanistan, it's considered a compliment. "One-eyed camel's backside." What's wrong with that, anyway? He's going to be completely useless tomorrow. What a... And I was relying on her to help me with my notes. I could do that. Well, you've got other things to do. Like what? Seeing those two home. Hey! Yeah, ha, ha, you got me! Late start. But I've done a whole page of that report thing so... What? Skin gets dry when you're lying in bed all day. Not that you will be, for long. You'll be back in the real world by tomorrow. Oh, will I? Who says so? The boss. And no lying still for hours on end. We want you changing position and wiggling that bum as much as possible, please. OK? OK. All right, I'm just going to wash my hands. He likes the sound of his own voice. Ah, he's lovely. I'm not allowed to treat any patients?! Dr Evans insisted and her partners agreed, reluctantly. But I haven't put MY side of the story yet. MY report. I'll make sure it gets to the practice manager. I haven't done anything wrong! Do you know how long I've been a nurse? About half as long as Zoe's been a doctor. Hackles down, Frankie. It's all part of the job. My team. You'll have to tell them. But no big drama. Just stay cool, calm and professional. Yes? You cow, Zoe Evans. You, you... Yes, you, you... ..patronising, smug... Yes, smug... ..vindictive... ..bloody... ..ice queen. 'Olly Murs, of course, and women all over the country in a swoon. 'A swoon. Smelling salts, whatever...' I'm not in the mood, Kenneth. No... No. So that's where we are just now. I'm sorry, Frankie. You don't deserve this. It means you'll all have to absorb my patients into your lists. Sorry. 12 between four? That's no problem. It's very unfortunate and our sympathy is with you, of course it is, but, you know, there are ways of going about... But this, too, shall pass. I'll start with working out the new schedules, then. We've never liked that Dr Evans, have we? Never mind, you should make the most of it. You and Ian could head off for a couple of days. What? Right then, parent-teachers meeting this afternoon. Joys of parenthood. Have I put my foot in it? What's wrong? Nothing. Yeah, there is. What's happened? You and Frankie. I've done something. It's not my fault. I had a skinful. When? The... Her birthday thing. Tell me you didn't. You and Ian? Andy knows, too. He's being very, you know... cold. What did you expect? A round of applause? Not you, too. I like Frankie. I like Ian. They're made for each other. If you've broken them up... Good. I've caught you. I'm just going. Frankie's asked if someone can look in on Robbie Preston. I've emailed you all the details. He needs a mouth care kit. Yeah, but I've got clinic. It's on the way. It will take you five minutes. No! No! I don't want it. Look, it's to make your lips better. No! How about if I do it? Hey? No! It's horrible. Right, OK, I'll put it here and when you feel like it, you can put some on. Yeah? I want Richie. Remember, the best way to stop your mouth hurting is to keep your teeth really, really, clean. I don't like her. Robbie! Sorry. Sometimes using a salt mouthwash helps. I can't see him doing that. Look, it's parents' meeting, darling. I've got to go. No! I don't want you to go. I thought you were going to the school. Look, it's a bit late now. I'll go, then. By the time you get there it'll be finished. I'll text Richard. I'll have another go later. I've got to be off. Are you not going to check his central line? Right. OK. If he'll let me. You going to be a good boy, or what? Five minutes, they said. How long have I been here? Your laptop. Andy said you were a bit down. Well, he had no damn right. Something to do with work, Dr Evans? Do me a favour, Ian, don't talk about me to my colleagues. Don't ask them about me, and do not... Do not... talk about me when you're in bed with Paula. I'm not sleeping with Paula. Hello. I don't know what to do. He's so ill. He won't stop crying. He keeps being sick but there's nothing left to bring up. I can't come, Diane, I'm sorry. I've tried the oncology team but it just goes to voice mail. 'They must be out on a call. Er, Dr Evans, then.' It's a locum service. Please. 'Paula.' No. 'He knows you, and he trusts you.' I'm not supposed to be... Please, he trusts you. This is normal. Remember we did say he'd probably be sick? But it just keeps going on and on. You said that if it gets too bad that there's an injection. Did you leave a message for the oncology team? Yeah. They just got back to us and we said you were on your way. I'm not even your nurse any more. That other one, she couldn't be bothered and we've called her but there's no answer and we don't like her. Robbie doesn't like her. OK. He's written up for metoclopramide. We'll sort him out, yes? Yes? OK. You make us all a nice cup of tea and I'm going to make a magic potion for Robbie. Thanks for this. No problem. I'm just going to use your bathroom. You all right? Tough time, isn't it? You were with Hope, weren't you? We're not mates or anything. It's all right. I get the message. Her mum doesn't like her hanging round with other kids. Most of the time her mum doesn't approve of me, either. Do you think Robbie's going to be OK? Every day that passes on his medications and with the treatment he's getting from hospital, his outlook should improve. If he died, it would be horrible. I mean, he'll be gone and I'll be left with Mum and Dad. I just keep trying to imagine. No, waste of time. Because you and Robbie are a team, and your mum and dad. You may not feel like it, but you are. And this year, your job is to be the home side crowd, cheering everybody on. You know, lifting their spirits when they're feeling down and tired. You reckon? Yeah. And the only way you can do that is just... ..just getting on with your life, you know, just having a laugh with your mates and doing OK at school. Like, not getting in the way. I didn't mean that. Yeah, well. I am, aren't I? I am in the way. Try and think of a bright future, instead of a bleak one. Yes? And try and get someone to talk to. How about Hope? She's a nice kid. OK. You know Josie? Yes. She's our practice educator. We've met. I'm here to talk you through the safeguarding issues in Liana Corden's case. Really? I didn't think there were any. Mrs Corden was paralysed and totally dependent on her husband? Yes. Then I really don't think you can say that there are no safeguarding issues. It won't help if you're defensive before we even start. Sorry. You get on with Joseph Corden? Would you say you were friendly? We weren't enemies. Was there ever anything in any way inappropriate between you? Good God. I believe you have, very recently, split up with your long-term partner? Dr Evans saw you having a slanging match with your ex-boyfriend in the car park. According to her, in full view of the patients. Hello, can I come in? Yes, of course. Hello?! Anyone at home? Yes. Come in. We're decent. Worse luck. Right, can you take your bowls out, please, then go upstairs and clean your teeth, nice and fast. Hey, look at you! I know, I scrub up well, don't I? I'm dazzled. Too late to see you at work, Dan? Well, I'm doing everything you told me to. Good. Not quite as expertly as you, but... Thank you. No, but you did all right, love. Right, I am going to direct operations from in here now. Brilliant. Ideal patient, you are. Seeing as I'm here for the grand transfer, I may as well give you a hand. I can manage. No, there's ways of doing it. Passed down through the centuries from Florrie Nightingale all the way to me. You know what your back's like. Fine! Have it your own way. You can do it with Billy Connolly. Oi, Mr Grumpy! Get back here. I've things to do! He's not usually like this. Lots of changes to get used to. It'll be fine. Is Zoe Evans saying I was having an affair with Joseph and helped him bump off his wife? I think you're the only one that's putting that into words. She must really hate me. She finds you combative and overemotional. So, what happens now? We've scheduled a meeting for tomorrow. For you to put your case, and Dr Evans to put hers. Try to think of it as mediation. No-one wants this to go to the Nursing and Midwifery Council... ..unless it has to. Straight feet! Listen, you're going to have to get used to this, all right? Don't drop me! Right, come on, you've got to help, too, you know! Stop laughing, you two, you're putting her off! You watching, Dan? Yeah, do you want me to help? No, no, I'm going to show you the one-man method, OK, so you just watch. Right, I'm going to start rocking, I'm going to count to three, and on three, I want you to push down on your good foot. I'll heave you up and you'll be transported, all right? Yeah, if you say so. All right, I'm starting. One, two, three. Push, push, push, push, push! Right, she'll get better at it. It'll help if she's not laughing as much. That's not a problem. She doesn't laugh for me. Yes, well, I'll be doing it on my own soon enough. Course you will. Right, I'm off. Right, you two, go and get your school bags. So, um, when will I see you again? Couple of days? See how you get on. But we can call you, yeah, if there's any problems? Aye. There won't be any. See ya. Bye. Oh, and you know that, do you? We don't need him. You're getting your physio, you've got me. Hang on, just because I've had a stroke, it doesn't mean that you get to tell me who I can have in this house and who I can't. I know, but it doesn't mean we turn the place into the flippin' high street, with all people coming in, left and right. One nurse. One MALE nurse. I knew it was that! I knew it. I'm not blind, Kel, I'm not deaf. Your neighbour's outside, waiting to give the kids a lift to school. Thanks. See ya. See ya. No fighting, no fighting. Hi, you all right? Right, belts on, belt on. Right, listen, extra polite today? Yeah, Dad. Yeah, seriously. Give us a kiss. Love you, see you later. Bye, bye, cheers. Bye, bye, bye, bye. You do realise she's going to get better? There may be some residual weakness but... Yeah, they told me that. I haven't got amnesia. Have I done something to upset you? What? Like flirting with my wife? I'm sorry? Am I not supposed to notice? Tell you what, maybe I'll just take the kids off and I'll leave you both to it? Dan... What, big, super nurse with your big strong arms? Do you work out? Here's the thing. When a young person has a stroke, they feel very vulnerable. A man feels less masculine, a woman feels less feminine. She's just trying to reassure herself... And that's what she's got me for. I'm sorry. I'll be more careful. No, you won't. Because... I don't want you coming back. I don't want you near my wife, I don't want you in my house, so... ..bugger off. No-one woke me! You're 13, you're old enough to get yourself up and off to school. Yes. Because you're too busy with him, aren't you? Oh, thanks for all your help, Richard, you spoilt little... Leave it, Tony, leave it. Where does he get off being so rude? You off to the hospital? Yeah, chemo. Yeah, I got your message. Finally. Sorry? We left those messages last night. Yeah, and I only picked them up this morning. You should have called the oncology team, anyway. They came, did they? Frankie came. You're joking! Yeah, we're having a right laugh! Paula! Can you come in here and close the door, please! I've just come back for syringes. Matt's given me five diabetics. Have you seen Robbie? Just now. He's off for chemo. Did you apologise? But they shouldn't have called me, anyway. The oncology team were supposed... Can you imagine, can you imagine what it's like to have a small child vomiting for hours on end? Knowing he's got weeks of this to go through and you just... You sorted it, didn't you? Yes. Yes, I did. And if anyone finds out I'm in serious shit. Then you shouldn't have gone. No-one was holding a gun to your head. Just like no-one forced you to interfere with Mr and Mrs Corden. And now we're up to our necks in your work, and you have the nerve to tell me off for nothing! Nothing? Totally nothing. I'm sorry your boyfriend's attracted to me, but maybe if you hadn't stood him up... You'd better leave now. OK, but you're making a mess of everything, you do know that? Yeah, yeah, with a little help from my friends. Hi. Saw your car. That camouflage net's useless. I need your advice. Same again, please. I'm not fit to give anyone advice. You're my team leader. Now it's your job to pour your wisdom down upon me. Frankie, what's happened? Is it Ian? I'm useless. I've let the team down. Useless. Everyone's doing my work and I've got this big bloody meeting tomorrow and I know I'm going to get sacked. I just know it. Don't be daft. The one thing I could always tell myself, no matter how shitty my life was, I did my job properly. And now... Here. Thanks. What? I havenae done anything. It's not him, Kat. Honest. Look, you cannae do this by yourself. Do you want me there? I'm not a child. Sorry, you see, there I go again. I've already shouted at Paula. That won't do her any harm. And I've only gone and employed some mad man who attacks cars and thinks he's it. I like him. Well, you like Tony Soprano and Phil Mitchell. Oh, it's all just... It's just falling apart, Andy. You think so? Well, I just got thrown out a patient's house. So, my card trumps your card. Cheers. Oh, that's hideous. What is that? Lovely. Richie! We're back. He's still at footie, darling. Can I go and watch? No, not tonight. I won't run round. Please? Pleeeese? Go on, then. Just for half an hour, mind. Hey, what if one of them have got colds? Out in the open air, he'll be fine. Let the lad be a lad. Well, wait a minute then. There we are. OK. Tony! The drug box! It was full. We'd had all the prescriptions when he came back from hospital. Can I see the medication regime? The lock's not been forced or anything. Paracetamol, codeine. That'll be what they were really after. Frankie Maddox! What was she doing? Oh, well, there you are, then. What? Wherever she pokes her nose in, trouble wherever she goes. The last person to access the drugs, one district nurse, Frankie Maddox. Thanks for coming. I don't understand why thieves would take the drugs and leave everything else? Have you had a break in? No. Nothing's been broken or forced or anything. Including the box. So, you must have left it open. No, I'm sure I wouldn't have done that. Where's Richard? He didn't turn up. The coach says he's going the right way to be dropped from the team. I knew we should have sorted him out this morning, cheeky little sod. I'm going to borrow his MP3. I've called the police. Good. Better safe than sorry. What were you doing here, anyway? You've no business with any of my patients. They asked me to come. She's our nurse. He's run away. Look. He left this. It says, "Don't come after me. "You'll be too late anyhow. "I'm sorry. Love Richie." What sort of damage would these drugs do, if he did decide to take them? The antiemetics, not much, but the analgesics... Pain killers. So if he were to take them all... It could be fatal. Robbie's in bed. I said you'd go up. Excuse me. Let me make you a cup of tea. You're not attending my patients, remember? Grow up, Zoe. You don't think that he would take them, do you? Well, he wouldn't, would he? No, there's no reason to think that. Yeah, but he was angry and he's been so... Look, I mean, if he does take them... Hi, Emma, it's Frankie. Er, the thing is... The thing is... You know when you sometimes do things automatically and then... Sometimes you do things really automatically and then... you just... I suppose I'm actually having a bit of a wobble. Hi, Emma, it's Frankie. Thought I'd, er... thought I'd call you before the brown stuff hits the fan. It's a bit of a problem. The truth is... er... The truth is... that, erm... I couldn't bear to face you either, so... The thing is... The thing is I've... I've handed my head on a plate to Dr Evans, because I can't be sure, if I... positive, positive... if I... if I did lock that drugs cabinet... box... thing. Um, do you know what? I'm going to start this again. Maybe he's been at school all the time. Maybe he's locked in the lavatory. Like the three old ladies. From Monday to Saturday. And nobody knew they were there. Oh, there she is. What's happened? I thought I'd missed you. Richard Preston's missing. Who? You know Richard, don't you? He's year 9. Oh, they don't really mix, the years. Or the boys and the girls. But you've seen who he hangs out with? Well, not the children she does. Will you shut up for one minute, please? Oh, that's lovely! Hope, you're going to miss registration. Go on! Quickly, go on. If you've got any ideas just give me a little... She hasn't. He may have taken a load of drugs with him, all his brother's drug regime. What for? We just hope he's not going to do anything with them. Oh, what, you mean like top himself? Do you want me to nip home and get you a megaphone? Sorry. Haven't you got this disciplinary meeting to go to? Ah, too much? Not enough? What do you think? Hello? Hi, Hope. 'I don't want Mum to know about this.' About what? Promise. 'Well, I can't unless I know what I'm promising.' Or the police or anyone. Promise. The police? Is this about Richard? 'Promise. I said I wouldn't tell anyone. OK, look, you know that I won't land you in any trouble if I can help it. I think I might know where he is. Right. 'His best mate lives up Manor Drive. Alfie Marshall.' OK. 'Well, the police are here talking to everyone,' but Alfie says he's sworn to secrecy. 'OK, OK, look, I get it. What number Manor Drive?' All I know is they've got a tree house. A tree house. OK, I owe you a pizza. Don't tell Mum about this, will you? I'm no grass. Thanks, darling. No show. I could wring her neck sometimes. You're aware of the latest? Putting a child at risk? What child? I know all about this. Well, I don't. Good morning, everybody. Morning. Morning. Nice to see you all here. Richard? Richard! Oh, you silly boy, what have you taken? How many did you take? What? Look at me. Look at me. How many did you take? These? None. What are you doing here? Get your trainers on. You're going home. Diane? Yeah, I've got him. He's fine. Kill the fatted calf. This is your brother's medication. I left him loads, enough for a day. And you're the expert all of a sudden? How did you get into the cabinet? Erm, the key? Oh! And the key was in the lock, was it? No. It was where they hide it. No big secret. Dunno what the fuss is, they don't want me anyway. You say that again and I will give you such a slap. You're not allowed to. Think so? Matt! Just the man. Who've we got kicking around with nothing to do? I don't know why District Nurse Maddox isn't here. I haven't been able to contact her on her mobile but I'm sure there's a good explanation. Yeah. I wonder if I could have a word at the outset? You should all be aware that in addition to the incident on the agenda, Frankie Maddox has administered drugs to one of my patients, following which, a substantial amount of various drugs have gone missing. I got a message this morning. Frankie was called out to Robbie Preston just after I'd spoken to her about Dr Evans' concerns. And she went? And apparently, yes, there are some drugs missing. I was hoping the incident would be resolved by now, but... We all do daft things, don't we? That's what life's about. You're no different. I wasn't going to take them anyway. Shouldn't have left that note then, mate. You don't know what it's like. Oh, no. Never a teenager, me. I went straight from 11 to 20 overnight. We've all been there. My dad's going to kill me. I bet you 20,000 quid he doesn't. Now look in there. Why? Chocolate. Can't be scared with a gob full of chocolate. Can ya? Fact. What a mess. How much do you eat? Never more than a kilo in half an hour. Now shut up and pass it over. This isn't just about District Nurse Maddox. If Richard Preston's taken those drugs, he could be dying somewhere. Frankie's not the only person that has access to that drugs case. The oncology team don't make that kind of stupid mistake, and neither do I. And neither does Frankie. Normally, no. But she's going through some very upsetting changes in her personal life. I'm sure we all feel sympathy. Should we be discussing personal lives? If they mean we make unwise professional decisions. She knew full well she shouldn't have attended that patient, but she did so anyway. Guilty as charged. Where the hell have you been? Liberating these. Sorry I'm late. Thank you. Sorry, are we inviting patients to pass judgement on us now? I'm not judging anyone. I just want to give my side of the story. I invited him. Please. Thanks. On the day that I had my heart attack, I knew that I'd been very lucky. That it could have been much worse. I was frightened, but not witless. I promised my wife that she could be at home, right up until the end, and I knew that if I went into hospital overnight, Dr Evans would have admitted her immediately. For a few days. She might have only had a few days left. She had weeks. No. I'm sorry. That is just plain wrong. Look, I don't know why you're doing this but... You both believed, you and your wife, that she might have only days? She was weak. She rallied when we had people round but... Anyway, we couldn't bear the thought of being separated, of her dying alone. And Frankie saved the day. We were both very grateful. You were in pain, you were under stress, she did not give you good clinical advice. She didn't give me any advice. I'd promised my wife that she could die at home, with me by her side. And it was always going to be on that day. Our anniversary. We decided weeks before that... That that would be the right day, to celebrate finding each other, for the years that we'd had, and for saying goodbye. As for any relationship between Nurse Maddox and me... ..you obviously don't know her very well. Hello. I'm on duty. You have to be quick. She's being a right cow. She's complaining about my work, she's ignoring me. I mean, she's meant to be my team leader. Oh, God, don't cry, not here. It's all right for you, no-one's talking to me, not properly. I'm getting a load of extra work that she's supposed to be doing and it's not fair. I haven't got anyone to talk to. Well... Yeah, and what does she care? Really? She doesn't, does she? She's off with Andy, isn't she? Like you never existed. Andy? Of course. They're always in the pub and he went round to hers the other night. They were dead rough the next morning. There are now two incidents to be taken into consideration. The first is the possible undermining of Dr Evans with Liana Corden. And whether she made this assisted suicide possible. And your decision to attend Robbie Preston, despite being asked not to. Can we note that was in response to a frantic phone call from the parents, please? Well, we all know the circumstances. The question is, can Frankie can be trusted to do her job? Thank you. I only told the truth. You know, I hadn't realised it was your anniversary the day Liana died. Well, possibly not the whole truth. They've got surgeries this afternoon so we're reconvening this evening. Oh, I thought I'd know by now. It's not that clear cut. But hopefully we'll reach a decision today, get our findings typed up. And my fate will be sealed. I'll call you as soon as there's any news. Take the rest of the day off, won't you? I've got a little problem that I have to sort out first. Just take a few bloody hours off, will you? You'll like Mary. I like Andy. This isn't just about you and Dan. It's about my nurse too. I have to safeguard him. "Safeguard"? After a stroke, you feel emotions more acutely and this... Well, she certainly does. ..coupled with all the problems you and Dan have to get used to... It's not about him. No, it's not about me. It's all about you. I have to protect my nurse from any situation that might... You have got a crush on the bloke. Oh, shut up! You're an idiot. OK, stop lashing out, the both of you. OK? OK? I just find it hard. It's, you know... Trying to keep the kids occupied, I'm trying to keep the house tidy, and I'm failing. I can't even look after you the way that Andy Scots git can. Well, Andy Scots git sails in here, bright and breezy, does his stuff and sails back out again. Yeah, leaving her with a contented smile on her face. Thank God for that! I mean, at least we've got one satisfied client. I mean, it's easy for him because she's just another patient. Look, he's just doing his job the best way he knows how. And everything that you two are going through is absolutely normal. OK, it's just a side effect of a stroke in the family. Honestly. Honestly. I could kill you sometimes. Not with your floppy arm. You'll have a job. Right, I'll ask Mary to call over tomorrow. OK? So this Mary, is she quite fit? Oh! Oi! I'm joking! Anyway, I'm on earlies tomorrow. I'd better... You don't have to. I won't bite. Not unless you want me to. Two singles. Fed up. Bored. Come on, Emma. 'This is Ian Hargrave, I'm sitting here by the phone 'but screening my messages, 'because chances are, you're my boss, my bank, or my mum. 'Just joking, Mum! 'Leave a message whoever you are.' What are you still doing here? It's nearly seven o'clock. He's had this brilliant idea. Disneyworld. We're all going to the Enchanted Kingdom? The NHS is paying for Robbie and one parent to go to America, aren't they? Yes, and his mum. So, we're going to send Richard and his dad too. And fit in a week in Florida at the same time. Just like that. No, with genius, focus, discipline and the fundraising skills of a master. I hope he's on a trial period? There she is. We thought you shouldn't be alone tonight. Even if you want to be. This is the team you've let down so badly. See how unsupported you are. Shut it. Any news yet? Not yet. What about a sponsored danceathon? Bit boring. Letters to celebs and articles in the newspaper. Oh, hell. What? No case to answer. Kicked out of court.

It's not my fault you don't feel the same way about yours. Hey, how's it going? I'm not a child. I love him. I'm not getting involved in this. Jake, where's Beatrice? I don't know. I left her behind. What?! It's over. You have completely blown this. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
