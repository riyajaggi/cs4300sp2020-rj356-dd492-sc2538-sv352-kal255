 Frankie (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 Frankie Maddox,head of a team of district nurses at a Bristol doctors practice,is concerned that sixty-year old Jean Winters is running herself ragged,caring for a terminally ill husband and crossing town to look in on Walter,her father,who has Alzheimers. Jean is resistant to outside intervention,fearing Walter will be institutionalized but Dr Zoe Evans tells Frankie she sees no alternative. However,when Walter,not knowing who she is,attacks Frankie,her colleague Andy insists she report it and ultimately she is unable to prevent the old man being taken away. She does however save the life of a permanently ill child whose mother,an army wife,is heavily pregnant but her obsession with her work wrecks the birthday surprise her partner Ian had for her and drives him to going off with another woman.

 Is that your birthday list? Sorry? Is that your birthday list? Continence pads and insulin. I don't half spoil you. Ian, don't make me late for work. Baz must've had a good send off - you stink of beer. You love it! Nice one, Baz. Love, I'm not on till tonight. Fags. Fags in my sitting room.

 Oh, yeah... Curry on my carpet. Sweaty plod in my bath. What the hell did you get up to? Nothing. Look, I'll clean it up. All of it. Yeah, well, I'm bursting for the loo, you idiot. If I have an accident on the way in, you're dead! We didn't wake you, did we, love? That was good, eh? Frankie! Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.

 ♪ Frankie, them bullets hurt me so... ♪ All clear again, Mr Thomas, so where's it going to be? Thigh, tummy, bum? Like the song says, ♪ Roll me over on my left side, Frankie! ♪ I was your man, but I done you wrong... ♪ Sorry if my hands are cold. Ooh, it's a funny sort of job. Well, I'm a funny sort of woman. Yeah... Jeanie left me a meat pie. Fancy a bite? Steak and kidney for breakfast? No, thank you. Breakfast? Why, what time is it? Oh, the bloody thing's stopped. No, no, it's half eight. How long have you been up? "My day or night myself I make "whene'er I wake or play, "and could I always stay awake... it would always be day!" Ha-ha! OK, well, remember to eat regularly. Little and often, yes? I know, I know, I know. No sugar, no booze, nothing that makes life worth living. Just Jean's meat pie, is it? I'll see you tomorrow. Be good. Now bloody what? Hey, look... It helps to turn it on. Who made it, then? What? What? The meat pie, what else? That's what we were talking about, wasn't it? Oh. Right. I thought you said Jean made it. Did she? Ah, that was good of her. Good morning, what's this - my friendly early morning call? I'm here now, Andy. Walking through the door. Peel your ears back and you'll hear my dainty footsteps. Bye-bye. Don't get at Paula, it's not her fault. We cannae visit her if we don't even know her name. She wrote it down. On a haematology specimen bag! What use is that? Then she threw it away! Don't go on. You know how rude Dr Evans is, I get flustered. What's this? There you go! Yay! I told you I didn't chuck it. And you're not supposed to staple these things. Mrs Hales, 27, 36 weeks gone, raised BP... I remember, she just moved from an army place. Her husband's in Iran. Afghanistan. Yeah, and her midwife's off sick. "Well, this isnae Tannochbrae." There's got to be more than one midwife in the city. She said the team's stretched to breaking point. Dr Evans cocking up our lives again. Poor attempt at the accent, by the way. Hey, I hope you didn't say we'd take her on? Paula? You know what she's like. You can't say anything to her. She looks down her snotty nose at you and you just die. Oaktree Estate. Which I think you'll find is in your part of town. Oh, it just had to be, didn't it? Yeah, 12 visits today. 12! One, two, three... Give us the address. 'Another great Tuesday morning, only four days 'to the weekend, and we're all just raring to go, are we not?' Well, a little late, a little stressed, but on the whole, Kenneth, yes! 'And to get us all in the mood... 'to take the world by its scruff...' Oh, yeah, now you're talking, my man! The tracks of my youth... Royal Engineers. Bomb disposal. Well, IEDs. Brave man. Army barmy. Hello! No school today? I'm poorly. Every virus going, Ruby comes down with it. I really appreciate this, Nurse. Oh, Frankie. It's not a problem. It's only taken a few minutes. Are you going to look after your mum for me? We look after each other. And she's very good - she's, er, she's too good, sometimes. Every time I take a nap she does the same. Old before her time. Hello. Oh, hello... again! Do you want to come in? Thank you. I've got the right flat, haven't I? Mr Winters? Jack, yeah. You're Mr Winters's wife! Yeah. He's, he's in the bedroom, he's ready. Oh, thank you. So, you're caring for your dad and a sick husband - I didn't realise. Why would you? Go on in. Look at the colour of it. It's lurid pink. It cannae be natural. It is. It's healthy. 120 calories. And most of that is sugar and fat. And fruit. See? On the lid. Raspberry. Oh, look, Cheryl Cole's got a handbag just like mine. Obscene, the money people spend on nonsense like handbags. Right, problem-solving team. We've got a woman who's not young herself, looking after a terminally ill husband and a frail and forgetful father, the other side of town. How best to help? Who's this? Jean Winters. Her husband's terminal CA, and her dad's Walter Thomas. Old Mr Thomas? He's lovely. Yes, and demanding and needs care... So... I mean, I'll get an assessment, but that'll take a month, so, any bright ideas until then? Howzat! Oh, no, it's not mine. I've got a gold padlock and a zip on both sides. Well, thanks for listening and for all your advice! Don't ask a question for which there is no known answer. What, how can we help Jean Winters? What can we do? Short of sticking her dad in a home. They don't want that. Can they pay for help? I doubt it. There you go, then. Hey, have we not got a GP meeting this afternoon? Damn. And it had to be Dr Evans, didn't it? Come on... You're such a terrible passenger. Only when I'm sitting next to a boy racer. Don't. I may be speaking out of turn but you do know he's organising another surprise birthday party? Oh, yeah, every year. Yes, this'll be the fourth surprise. So, you're not going to answer because..? Because I know why he's ringing. To say, "Sorry, babe. Honest." You know, and then he'll make me laugh, and then I'll find myself telling him, you know, don't worry about clearing up, so... I'm so glad I'm not a woman. It must be exhausting. Yeah, but remember, us girlies can manage two things at once. Like? Like being really, really, pissed off with him, and really, really, laughing at him and really, really... ..no, really, fancying the pants off him. That's three things. Four. Yee-ha! Hurrah! At last. Let's get started, shall we? Mr Banswell. Mm-hm, fine, nicely stable on the new insulin regime. Er, Mrs Isadora Harker. Referred to the community psychiatric nurse, but we're carrying on with... Psych nurse? How long is that going to take? Months. If not years. Er, have you seen Heather Hales? Yeah, she's fine. Elevated BP but nothing alarming. Can we talk about Jack Winters and Walter Thomas? Winters. Terminal CA, isn't he? Yeah, and his wife is nursing him at home, but I've just discovered her dad is Walter Thomas and she's trying to look after both of them - impossible. Thomas is pernicious anaemia, isn't he? And diabetes. Mild dementia. What's the problem? Well, his daughter can't look after both of them. Well, what can I do about that? Precious little, and the sooner his daughter realises that, the better. I'm sorry. How many times do I have to apologise? I've spent the whole day doing the house - you haven't even said thank you. You've just pushed the hoover round. I bet you've not done the loo and you've not... What? I just heard myself. Sorry. Frustrating day. I shouldn't take it out on you. I'm used to it. Am I that bad? No, you're just... What? If you were a pie chart, work would be 90%, and I'd be the little, sad crumb of boring pastry. No, no, you'd be a big fat mouthful of stuffed crust with a hint of smelly old anchovy. I love you. When I'm angry? No. No punch line. I love you. I'm not getting middle-aged and crabby, am I? Oh, my God. I've just realised. You will be, won't you? What? You'll be 40 minus four. Also known as 36. Yeah, old enough to be a granny! You keep digging. No, think about it, how sad is that? Shagging a middle-aged woman! Desperate or wh...? It was a joke, honest... Fine. It's special duty, traffic control at Colston Hall tonight. I'll be back when I'm stood down. About one. I'll try not to wake you. Put your ear plugs in. And turn that music down! Make me! Ian? You don't miss your pals at school? She's only just started there, so she doesn't feel like she's missing much. OK. All done. Right, Ruby, next... Mid stream, if you please. If I can. You must get a bit bored stuck inside all day. A bit. Are you still feeling poorly? Not all the time. Come here, come on. So what is it, hmm? Your tummy, your head, everything? No. Just a tingly thing in my fingers and toes, and then I get woozy. But then I get a bit sick to my stomach. I get the tingle first, then the wooze and then the sick. And when does this happen? If I laugh a lot. Or run. And when I go upstairs. And in the shower. You want to have a go? OK, bring your hair back. Frankie Maddox. Hi, Jean... Right, OK. I told you, Dad! I told you and I told you and I told you! I want a pie. You never make me a pie. I said don't use the oven, and you had a pie yesterday! Hi. You just missed the bloody fire brigade. I didn't call them. No, Dad, your poor neighbours did. Again. I was worried about him taking a chest full of smoke. I'm all right. He was coughing and I panicked. I'll have a listen to his chest. You will not. You'll do as you're told, Dad. Not that you ever do. He knows not to use that oven! Oh, that may be my fault. I turned it on yesterday. At the wall. He had a pie. Yes, and it was already cooked. Yes, and he put it in the oven. I thought he wanted it warm. I just turned it on, Jean. Oh, great. Thanks. Fabulous! I leave that up so he can't... Oh, what's the use? And it's an oven, Dad, it's not a washing machine! OK, why don't we just have a sit down? OK? Come on, Mr Thomas... Come on, come and have a sit down. I'm 60. I can't spread myself this thin any longer. What's all this smoke? I can't be doing with this carry-on every bloody day. Cuppa? Yeah. I'm at breaking point. I can't go on like this much longer. No one could. I'm just so tired. Yeah, I can see. Listen, I'm going to request a case conference, to get him assessed. No. Thanks, but no. Well, it's the only way we're going to get any help for you. Maybe a carer once a day, someone to help him up in the morning or maybe settle him down at night? I don't want anyone to... What, Jean? I don't want anyone to know we need help. Why not? Because they'll take him away. They'll put him in a home. No, they wouldn't. They will. The social workers and all that lot. It's what they did with my mum. Your mum needed full-time nursing. Your dad's just a bit frail. I'm not having him... I'm not having him going in one of them places. Neither is anybody else. That's why we've got to get the assessment done, Jean. OK? If you don't get any help, you'll get ill. Then what will happen to him? And Jack? So, please, just, please, just trust me. OK? I will get you the help that you need. By hook or by crook. Right. What sort of help are we going to get with these cutbacks? Pah! I laugh at cutbacks. I sneer at them. So, I can start the wheels rolling? If you're sure they're not going to drag him away, kicking and screaming. I'm sure. I'm positive. OK... Thanks. When you've finished gassing, I've had bugger all to eat all day. Charming! He was a lovely dad, you know. Oh, he still is. Yeah, yeah. He tries to be. Are you all right? Yeah, yeah. Well, I'd best get myself sorted. I've got another man waiting for me on the other side of town. Now you're just boasting! Bye. Bye-bye. "You Don't Have To Say You Love Me" by Dusty Springfield 'Oh, for heaven's sakes, woman, pull yourself together. 'Cheer up and get a grip. Move on, move on!' Oh, Kenneth The Bruce. It's not often you're wrong but you're right again. I am ready for a beer. Are you coming? No, got to go home and face the music. Happy music or Leonard Cohen? Probably John Cage. Three hours of silence. I locked him out. When? Last night. I mean, it was a joke, I didn't mean to... It's kinda hard to explain. What did he do? Slept in the car. It's not that funny. Yeah, it is. Like the time you threw his car keys in the river. I gaily tossed them to him. If he's got all the catching skills of a house brick that's not my fault. The man is a saint. See ya. See ya. Hello, little girl. Prick! I really wanted to get a Doctor Who mask. In bed with Doctor Who... Well, I suppose it would depend on which one. No, one of the monsters. The Ancient One. Yeah? Cos you and him... Ah, go on. Well, you and him... you'd have a lot in common. Yes! All right? What? Nothing. All right? Yeah. Good. 'The Liberal Democrats today warned more political pain lies ahead 'as the Coalition takes difficult decisions to secure 'economic recovery. Amid dire poll ratings, 'the Deputy Prime Minister will close his party's annual conference 'by insisting that choices made...' ♪ If I stay there will be trouble ♪ If I stay there will be double... ♪ 'One area where there seems to be a clear difference...' ♪ Come o-n-n-n and let me know... ♪ Mr Thomas wants to stay where he is. That's what his family wants too. But if his daughter's exhausted, and the neighbours have called the fire brigade out twice already... One was just the toaster setting off the alarm and we've all done that. They just need a bit of help, a few hours a day. You just told me the care agency couldn't give you any hours. So, we'll just kick up a stink. You could request an assessment from occupational therapy. I could, but there are more pressing cases, people with no relatives at all. Well, there's got to be something we can do. Why do you always insist there is something we can do? Sometimes there isn't. Apart from putting the old guy into a care home. Then we're back where we started. He won't go. She doesn't want that. You do realise, the longer you indulge this old man, the more pressure you put on his daughter? Well, his wife went into care, and it wasn't a good experience. This isn't a good experience. Sitting in there, listening to aches and pains and people with bad back insurance claims all day isn't a good experience. Life's full of it. Hello. Hello. Ah, no school again? She went in, but they called to say she wasn't feeling well. Not more wooze, is it? It's just going on and on this time. Usually she's poorly for a few days, but this time... Ever had a diagnosis? We've been to three different GPs and they all say the same. "It's a virus," "It'll go when it goes," etc, etc. The old virus cop-out, eh? She's not her usual, happy self, either. I am! OK, um, how about I get you an appointment with a consultant? Do you think it's that serious? Probably not, but it's beginning to worry you, isn't it? So may as well find out once and for all. Right then, I'm going to order myself a big fat cream cake and you are not to tell anyone, OK? Paediatrics, please. Hi, could I talk to Mr Lasco? Frankie Maddox. Morning, sir. What the hell do you want? It's me, Frankie. Get out of my bloody house! It's me, Mr Thomas, the district nurse. Bugger off, I don't want you here! Look, I've got to give you your insulin, OK? Get out! Get out! Get out! OK... That'll teach you. I was in the Army, you know. OK, OK, I'm going! I'm not one of your poor old codgers that you can rob. HE SOBS Life's never dull, is it? Oh, I'm so sorry. It's all right. It's not your fault. No, I stopped to talk to Dr Evans, and I'm later than usual. Maybe... Maybe his blood sugar's low? It's not your fault. Look, he gets like this. Oh, Jean. That is awful. It's only just started. Well, a few weeks ago. Well, I wish you'd told us. I meant to, but he's my dad. How could I? He doesn't even know he's doing it. This can't go on, Jean. Look, I can manage. No, I'm going to have to speak to Social Services. No, that's why I didn't tell you. I don't want them barging in. I have no choice! You know, what if he hits a child, or somebody hits him back? He never goes out! He wouldn't get the chance. Well, that's it. They'll just lock him up now. No, it won't come to that. Look, he hates those places. It broke his heart when he couldn't manage my mum anymore and we'd go to visit her every day, and it was terrible. She was never in her own clothes, they'd say hers were in the wash or lost... And she was just so sad, like all the life went out of her. She lost loads of weight, and we knew she wasn't eating and nobody cared, and he'll go downhill just like she did. Butter wouldn't melt. He nursed my mum for years. And now, when he needs looking after... You're doing a great job, and he thinks the world of you. I couldn't bear to see him go into a home. Please, don't tell anybody about this. Please. OK, but he needs to be assessed. No, because once they get their foot in the door... Please, just... Just leave things as they are. Please? What? It's a veg. It's hot. Stop looking at me like that! If she'd got into good habits when she was younger... Too late now. 36, start checking for osteoporosis soon. Chubby people don't usually get it. Er, hello! What is this? Good morning? Great, thanks, why? I've had a hell of a time. If I'd known it was all leg ulcers and ingrown toenails... Sometimes I wonder why I didn't go into midwifery. All those screaming women? No thanks. How did you do it? What? You know fine well what. What, this? It's nothing. So how did you do it? Walked into a door. No, really, I did. OK. Which door? In confidence? If that's what it takes. I'm a bit shaken, actually. I did walk into a door. But I was sort of knocked into it. He didn't mean to. Please, tell me it wasn't Ian. Ian? Good God, no. Mr Thomas. If it was Ian he'd be in ITU by now. Mr Thomas. Yes, he was probably a bit light-headed, needed insulin, gets a bit confused. Whoa, whoa, hang on, what's all this "in confidence" stuff? You have filed an incident report? No, there's no need. It's nothing. And have you told anyone at all? No! Franks! You cannae pretend this hasn't happened. He's old and confused and I startled him. Then make a note of it. Make sure everyone else knows. There's no need. He's a big softie, really. Sit down. What? Oh, come on, I'm not concussed. So something happens tomorrow. Right? You're ill, one of the others goes to visit him... Talk about overkill. Don't you think you owe it to them to warn them? I won't be ill, I'm never ill. Or if he hurts someone else and you've done nothing to stop him?! He won't. Or hurts himself? Lashes out at someone not quite as understanding? I've gone through this with Jean, OK? He doesn't go anywhere, he doesn't see anyone. This is great! Everyone else knows where to draw the line, but Frankie Maddox, oh, no. I don't want to make things worse. You have to protect the team, Frankie, and you have to protect yourself. OK, if it happens again... Hopeless. Bloody hopeless. Get him assessed. It's the least you should do. Hey, Ruby Red Shoes, I've just made a very special appointment for you. Mum's crying. She's been trying to get you. Something's gone wrong. I'm bleeding. OK. That might be nothing to worry about. How much? Um, it looks like a lot. OK. No big panic, OK? Deep breaths. Deep breaths. It's going to be all right. I'm sorry to be a nuisance. No, you're not. That's why I'm here. There you go. Hello, Molly. I thought you said you didn't know if it was a boy or a girl. We don't. The minute they told me, I just knew. Don't say a word. OK? Hey, Andy. Any problems? No, none at all. We've split your calls up between us. How's the mum? Dying for a cup of tea. You're driving a patient? No. Yes. Off duty. Don't go on... So, I've got Ruby an appointment with paediatrics tomorrow, and, do you know, she waved to the new baby today, and I think that new baby might just have waved back! And how's your head? Fine, thanks, how's yours? Ruby? She's asleep. Ruby... Ruby... Ruby... Ruby! Andy, hold on, don't hang up. She's not breathing. Oh, my God! Andy, can you hear this? Yeah, where are you? I'll call the paramedics. We've hit some traffic... Hello? Frankie, speak to me. Oh, damn it. Oh, God! Help us. Undo the belt. Is she dead? Oh, God! Please, no. Please no, no... Hey there, Ruby Tuesday! Hey, she's back with us. Thank God, thank God. No, no, no, lie still, Ruby, it's all right, just lie still. Oh, no, she's gone again - Ruby, wake up. Ruby, wake up! 'Emergency, which emergency service do you require?' Ambulance. 'Emergency ambulance, tell me exactly what happened.' This is a cardiac arrest call. I'm Lead District Nurse Frankie Maddox, I'm on the Colton Dual Carriageway with an eight-year-old child in cardiac arrest. Request paramedics or police escort. Please advise. 'One moment, please.' I'm a first aider. Can I help? Chest compressions, I'll do mouth to mouth. You're on six. 24 more, please. 'This is ambulance despatch, we have a paramedic on the way to you. 'Which side of the dual carriageway are you on?' Eastbound. We're stuck in traffic. 'We're doing everything we can to get through.' 30 more, please. Nelly The Elephant. Can you look out for the ambulance for me, please? OK, we've got respiration and heartbeat. OK. We're going to come in under our own steam. 'A police car and an ambulance are on the way.' Sorry. We can't wait. OK, sweetheart, we're going to get you back into the car. You get in. One, two, three - help. Can you clear a lane for me? Cheers. Come on, pull over. Over here. Come on, move. Come on - move! Move over! Come on, move! In there, in there... In there. Go. Come on, move! How far's the hospital? At this rate, three minutes off the next roundabout. Heather! I've got you. 'Hi, you're through to Andy. Please leave a message.' Hey, Andy. We made it. They've got her all wired up... but they're 90% sure it's super ventricular tachycardia. They're going to give her a pacemaker tomorrow. I am bloody starving. Shall we go out for a steak? All right. 'Fess up. What you done? What? You never cook. Oh, I do so. No, not dinner, dinner. Pasta and crap, but not, not proper dinner. Well, maybe I've turned over a new leaf. No, seriously, Franks, what you done? Well, it's my birthday tomorrow. And I know you'll have arranged a lovely surprise for me. Who told you? I don't know what the surprise is, but... there's always a surprise... usually a party. Bit predictable, eh? No, nothing wrong with that. I just want to make a fuss of you, before you make a fuss of me... because I love you. Ah, babe. "Frankie, you are the wind beneath my wings. "You make everything possible and even the grey days bright. "Now get up and get rid of that curry stain. "All my love, for ever and a day, Ian." I don't think you should tell me off in front of everyone, Mary. I'm not telling you off, I'm trying to explain to you why it matters. I thought there was a system for official warnings and things. Get over yourselves, girls. Who's on about any sort of warning? I thought you'd all be out on the road by now. We've got to make home visits to five clinic patients from yesterday. She forgot to take the specimens to the labs. Why did you say "forgot" like that? Like "forgot"? Oh, happy birthday, chick. Happy birthday. Yeah, happy birthday, Frankie. Thank you. Here you go, here's a big silly card and a pressie. Oh, thank you. Can I save it for tonight? Yeah. Thank you. Where could they be? Are you still here? No, I'm on the by-pass, getting a speeding ticket. I've lost them. How could I lose them? If it's the mileage claims, they're all done. What? Entered and everything? Mm-hm. Timesheets and monthly reports too, while you were being heroic on the by-pass. I love you, Nurse Peat. I know. So are you going to manage to have a couple of hours off and enjoy your birthday? Oh, yeah, later. I said I'd call in on Heather. Take her a nightie and stuff. And they're starting Mr Thomas's assessment today, so... Miracles and wonders! What? I do listen to you sometimes, you know. So you filled in an incident report form? No need. It was an accident. No, it wasn't. Shut up. You want them to assess him with half the information! I refer the honourable member to my earlier response. Could you, er, could you call the Army? Aye. I'll ring Whitehall right away. It's one-two one-two, isn't it? He's in Afghanistan, Stephen Hales. How hard can it be? Do you even know which regiment he's in? Yes. He disarms bombs and IEDs. But you, you, don't go putting yourself out for him! They're going on half-hour BP checks. That's good. Yeah, thanks for telling them. And Ruby will soon be a bionic super-woman. Right, from now on I don't want you to budge from this bed. And Ruby? You can take it in turns. They won't mind? Are you kidding? Two people in one bed? If the bosses find out, it'll be an NHS directive this time next week. Are you sure you can give us all this time? Mm-hm. Positive. And, er, it might make up a tiddly bit for being so slow to get Ruby to a consultant. Like I said, she wasn't your patient. The world is my patient. Come on, Ruby - you're on! She'll be out before you know it. Here you go. You can relax now. She's on the mend. Go on. Go home. We're fine. OK. You've got my number? Yeah. Go on. It's all done. I'll pop back in the morning. We'll be home by then. Good night, goodbye, and thank you. Hi Andy, she's back in the ward and looking good. What a relief! 'Where have you been, Franks? We've been trying to get you.' Had my phone off, didn't I? 'We've had a call from Mr Thomas's daughter. 'She's in a real state, Frankie. They started the assessment.' What, already? That's annoying, I promised that I'd... '..Be there. Yes. Jean said. 'Just get a move on. The old guy's kicking off.' OK. Stop them - don't let them. What are you doing? Please keep calm. They're locking him up. We're taking him into care under Section 4 of the Mental Health Act. Don't make it any harder. Where are you taking him? St Joseph's. You promised me this wouldn't happen. He's very disoriented. He didn't know his daughter. He picked a knife up and threatened us. Yes, but he was confused! He didn't mean it. Very confused, yes. We can't leave him here. OK, look, this is just an emergency, not the full 28 days - just let him go for now and we'll sort it out, OK? Why are they taking me away? I'm sorry, Mr Thomas. We can't leave you in the house alone. But Jeanie's here. My Jeanie. Aren't you, lovely? Tell them. Jean's got to go home. Liar! She wouldn't leave me all alone. Well, her husband needs her. I need her. Stuff him. He can make his own tea. Jeanie! I don't want to go! Let him get settled in. Seeing you like this is only going to upset him. Oh, God... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. This is the only thing we can do. Stop them. You promised... You cow. You right royal cow. That is the last message I run for you. You look... sweet. Wolf whistled, from one end of the town to the other. No more than a sex object. On my way, sweet thing. Get ready to be completely knocked out by my fabulousness. If I'm late, it'll be because my taxi driver's ploughed into a shop front, dazzled by all my bling... I love you. Hi... I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to call, um... Here we go... I knew it. How often? Every seven minutes. I'm not leaving Ruby. She's well away. No, she'll wake up. Heather, you need to be in maternity. They're waiting for us. Look at you. Been Gok Wanned! Oh, wow. 'You really have tracked him down?' Yeah, he's already on his way home. Soon as they heard there was a concern about her BP. That's great. But where is he now? Somewhere between Afghanistan and Brize Norton and here. Not good enough. Does he know about Ruby's pacemaker? 'No, how could he?' Do they not have phones? He's been on an Army transport plane. She's been in hospital. 'Well, I'm not leaving until Stephen gets here.' I don't know what you want me to do about it. See if there's any way you can speed things up, you know - get someone to meet him when he lands. I don't know! The plan is he'll get a train. That means he could be here by the morning. This is my fault. 'I mean it, I'm not leaving her alone.' Going to give it a rest with the guilt thing? It's getting a wee bit wearing. I've done my best, and so have you, all right? Good, good. You're doing really well. The baby's head is well down now, but we really need to examine you. Come on, we need to get you to the delivery room. Ruby? Fast asleep. Come on... We'll tell you the minute Ruby wakes up. Oh, God, it's strong... Oh, God. Oh, I need Stephen. I need Stephen. Oh... That's it. Well, how long? An hour? Two, tops. But it's 8.30 now. Place doesn't close till one, does it? Yeah, but... I know... but just a bit longer. "Just a bit." Her husband will be here any minute now, probably. And Ian... 'What?' 'It will be worth the wait, I promise.' Off, please. Yes, sorry. That's a contraction, come on, that's it, good girl. Good, right, now I'm going to give you this. Now you grab hold of this. Come on, now, that's it, come on, grip on and do some breathing with me... come on. You're doing really well. You're doing it, that's it. That's it, let it out, let it out. Stephen! 'Message number, I dunno, 47? 53? 'Anyway, it's me...' Er, I've got this ring here. Diamond. And that's what tonight was all about. Stupid me, eh? You don't care about anyone or anything, but you, and your wonderful job. You know what? I wouldn't bloody marry you if you were the last bloody woman in the world. Well done! You fabulous woman. Congratulations, Mum, you have a little girl. She's gorgeous. Hello, darling. Oh, look at you. Oh, darling. And that's from your daddy. Your lovely daddy. Afghanistan. He wanted to be here, he so wanted to be here... Oh, I'm sorry, Frankie. No, you go ahead. Cry and blow, cry and blow. Find a rhythm. It's a girl. Oh, God. Oh, God. How was your birthday, then? Wonderful. Sorry you got stuck working. It was fabulous. Amazing and perfect. Is that vomit down your dress? Is this the best job in the world, or what? Thumped one day, puked on the next? Do you think they might name the baby after me? Why would they do that? Well, why not? You're drunk on emotion. Have you spoken to Ian? Not for a bit. Is he a bit pissed off? Make the call. He is, isn't he? And here's me practising how to say "Yes, please" all week. What? He was going to propose. I found the ring. Oh, bloody hell. No, seriously, Franks, make the call. Nah, better face to face. He'll shout a bit and then he'll see the funny side. It'll be fine. I know you're upset... I know you're disappointed, and I'm really sorry. I mean, I'm really, really, really, sorry. I can't say it enough. But it's like you said, isn't it? We understand each other's work. Don't we? Ian? Are you there? Ian? You, er... You haven't listened to your messages yet? What? No. It's all been mad and a bit... ..bloody marvellous this end. Why? 'Ian? Sweetheart? Ian?' Where the hell have you been? Didn't see how slaughtered she got on your birthday, did you? Every cloud... She was wasted, oh, yeah! Shut your mouth, Karen. I need to tell you something. Hey, hey, hey. You're going to get flattened. Who's the woman? No-one you know. What's happened? I'll be fine. I'm feeling better. Can you make him understand he needs to be in cardiac care? If she'd gone into a hospice a week ago, maybe he wouldn't have had a heart attack. And don't think this is the end of it. If the CPS are not prosecuting, the primary cause of death... Don't think it's the end of it for you. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
