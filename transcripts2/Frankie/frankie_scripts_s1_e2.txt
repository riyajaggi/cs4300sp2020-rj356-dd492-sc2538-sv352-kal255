 Sorry if my hands are cold. Funny sort of job. Well, I'm a funny sort of woman. Yes! Come on! You're such a terrible passenger. Only when I'm sitting next to a boy racer. 'I love you.' When I'm angry. No, no punch line. It's my birthday tomorrow. I know you will have arranged a lovely surprise for me.

 Who told you? But I don't know what the surprise is. There's always a surprise. Oh, I thought you'd all be out on the road by now. Sorry, I didn't know who else to call. Everyone else knows where to draw the line, but Frankie Maddox... You don't care about anyone or anything but you and your wonderful job. 'I know you're disappointed and I'm really sorry. 'I mean I'm really, really, really sorry...I can't say it enough. 'Ian, are you there?' DOORBELL RINGS Just the once will do actually. I just passed your car. It's still down by the pub. Are you not coming into work?

 I'm not putting this uniform on for the fun of it. You're going to be so late! You haven't left your car in town all weekend? It's not clamped, is it? Not yet but soon as the warden gets started... Do me a favour, hang on a minute, give me a lift to it, hey? Just a minute - promise. Where the hell have you been? It was work. A child collapsed. It was work. Don't scrunch that up! Two days! I was worried sick. So you can go missing but I can't? I didn't. You knew where I was. What is this about? You. You. Treating me like a...like a nobody. A nothing. Like I'm a sideshow to your great and exciting life. Well, we're going to have to talk about this later. So, you didn't need your car all weekend? Obviously not. Is it a bloke? Lippy. Slow down. Karen! Tell me who he is! No-one you know. Yeah, but...! Come on. Details! Drop me off here. See you there. RADIO: 'If you look at the renewables roadmap, which is the way we're... 'I'm not looking at the roadmap, I'm looking at the facts...' Bloody politicians! Just answer the damn question, you idiot! Come on, John Humphrys. Have a cup of tea and calm down. I bet that's what his producer says to him every morning. Now then, my darling. HOOVER WHIRRS Leave it. It stinks, and it's full. Leave...it. I'm sick of this. DOOR BANGS 'Andy, I have a new client for you - Max Hall.' 11 visits, Franks, I don't need any more. It'll only take ten minutes, and you go right past Cromwell House. Oh, go on! Go on! I've got 11 too! You see, this is why we need an admin person. Which is why we've appointed one. I cannae see her. Who said it's a her? I said, I've got 11 too. Aye, quickie insulin jabs and sweet old dears giving you cake and that. See, me, I get all the scabby stuff. Oh, for a minute there I thought Florence Nightingale had walked in. You go right past his door. Bloody hell. All right. Where's his notes? You could try under his name. He was an oil worker, injured last year, lower leg amputation. Dressing clinic, no show. Dressing clinic, no show. Oh, look, dressing clinic... No show. He won't feel like coming in, will he? With an infection in his amputation scar. That's because he keeps missing dressing clinics! ♪ There's a hole in my bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza ♪ There's a hole in my bucket, dear Liza, a hole! ♪ You see, a no-show, won't-do-as-he's-told patient and who gets him? Muggins. That's right. It's a compliment, really. It's cos you're so good with the bad 'uns. Oh, no, no, not again. Who have you got? Mrs Khan. Mrs Khan who doesn't believe in diabetes. Great(!) Thanks, again. It's a compliment really. All I really want is a shower... If we could just get me into the shower somehow... Mmm, I know. We'll see what we can do. And this pain... I think it's time we asked the palliative team to start calling. So we won't see you anymore? Oh, yes. You're not getting rid of us. We'll even up our visits. But they're the experts in pain control and all the things you're beginning to need now. How long? Sorry. I didn't mean... No, it's all right. If I had that answer, I would tell you, but motor neurone disease has its own timetable. We were told two to five years from the onset of symptoms. Yes, this particular MND, yes. So we've done well. Mm-hmm. Four years. Mm-hmm. Promise me I won't be taken into hospital? Yes, I promise. And Andy said you're beginning to find swallowing difficult? Yeah, when she's tired. I've got an aspirator coming. I'll show you how to use it. Drowning. Will I drown? When the time comes, you'll be in a lovely sleep. Better get that champagne ready. Oh, you're going out with champagne? In style. Strawberries and champagne. And John Martyn playing. "May You Never". ♪ May you never lay your head down ♪ Without a hand to hold ♪ May you never make your bed out in the cold... ♪ RADIO: 'What a good Popmaster that was! Well done to both players.' Bum! Missed it again. MUSIC: "I'll Get Along" by Michael Kiwanuka ♪ I know I didn't call ♪ But I'll be alone in a little while ♪ You know sometimes when I don't call ♪ I'll still get along in a little while ♪ I know sometimes I wonder ♪ Sometimes I take too long ♪ But I know where I'm headed... ♪ Are you getting out on your crutches? Yeah, with my staffie and a tin can for coins. Oh, you got a dog? Joke. Have you made any plans for the future yet? Grow another leg. Or get a job? Join a sports team. I've never done sports in my life so now I've lost a bloody leg I'm going to turn into Mo Farah? I run a basketball team down at the gym, Thursday afternoons. Bully for you. You not finished yet? DOOR OPENS You know, if you came to clinic twice a week, it wouldn't get into this state. It's not forever, Max. It's just until it's healed and you get used to the prosthetic. That'll be never then. He never wears it. I've got a bloody infection! He sits on that sofa, stuffing his face, watching the box. The only thing he's managed to achieve in the past three months is bloody piles. Yeah, but they are world-beating piles. If you're not happy, you know where the door is. Oh, no. I've put as much into this place as you. I sunk all my savings into this deposit. There you go, then. You're as stuck as me. Remember what I said to you last week? So much. And I can remember so little. Hmm. You remember what you want to remember. No sugar, no jalebi, no... the other things, the sweets. A little...moderation. No! No, not even a little. You get all the sugar you need in your starchy food. Oh, come on, shall we just get this done? Sit down. If you could just lose some weight! I don't smoke, I don't take drugs. That doesn't actually help. Here, give us your finger. You could be doing this yourself. I do it myself. When you feel in the mood isn't enough. Every day. Every morning, every evening. Routine. I've done it myself for two years. Yes, and your sugar's been all over the place, hasn't it? OK, today... Has the chiropodist been to check your feet? You don't need to talk to me as if I'm a child. I'm a grandmother five times. Give me your feet. I can't give you my feet - feet are dirty, on dirty floor. Is that why you've not seen the chiropodist? You do realise, don't you, that if you get a foot injury, you could end up with gangrene? Then I won't get an injury. Problem solved. My brother-in-law and his brother-in-law. Please. Please. If you could just give us a bit of privacy? They lead a charmed life, don't they? I suppose all of this is for them? Not only, but yes, if they are hungry. Well, do they realise that you've got cardiac failure, a chest infection and diabetes? Do you have a family? Yes, I've got a husband and a daughter, but I don't really see what that's got to do with it. One day your daughter will be grown up. Come back then. Sorry, what? Let me take you to the bathroom. You will need to wash your hands. You were on the phone, so... Thanks, cheers. How much do I owe you? Egg? They didn't have anything else. £1.80. Anyone want a second-hand sarnie? Get it down your neck and stop moaning. KNOCK AT DOOR Come back at two! Andy. Yeah, well. Have you got a minute? And they say romance is dead. Be nice. Shut it. Back at two. Be nice! They having a domestic? He arranged her birthday party, had a proposal all lined up, the ring twinkling on a velvet cushion, and she stood him up. What do you think? Not the ideal place, but hey. I'm on lates, start in an hour. Erm...so if we don't talk now... Anyway. SHE GASPS Ahhhhhhhh! Is there something you'd like to ask me? You could at least open the box. It's lovely. It's lovely. I found it. Not the greatest hiding place. You knew? Well, I suppose it could have been for someone else but I was hoping... You knew I was going to propose, and it didn't mean anything? It meant everything. Obviously not, as you couldn't be arsed to turn up. Ian, lovey, you know what my job is like and I know what yours is like. I couldn't leave Heather to have a baby on her own. Stop, stop talking! Just stop talking. And stop looking so bloody smiley. Can I try it on, please? No. I, er... I need to tell you something. Hey, hey, you're going to get flattened. Come on. Listen, I was upset, I was angry. I was a bit drunk. What? Hang on. What?! You've ruined everything. No, I haven't. Come on! There was a girl. At the pub? And after. Is that why you stayed away? You were with her? Not the whole... not the whole weekend. That...that night? If you'd have just turned up, Franks. Take me back to the office. I'm sorry. Why did you tell me? I don't know. I just thought... You wanted to hurt me, is that it? No! I wanted you to understand. What? About me, coming first. About US coming first. Right. Let's, erm... ..give ourselves a few days, eh? Give ourselves some time. OK. Thanks. We haven't got any forms. Oh, thank you for nothing(!) They're useless. Oh, Frankie, do you know anything about these, erm, interpreter request forms? Frankie? Frankie? I think she's crying. Franks? Love? You have to go onto the council website and print them off. What? If you want an interpreter. Right, I'm off to the clinic. Paula! Stop skiving and get out on your calls. 36, and nothing. Takes some doing, that. Job, house, car, career, friends. Can you stop doing that? No. I'll cool down, I'll never get started again. What's happened? Nothing. Just, you know, just thinking. Am I being bonkers? A-ha. What's madder? Marrying or not marrying? Look at people we work with - kids with multiple step-dads. Women with kids by different blokes, all of which buggered off. And even if they do get married, what does it last? A year? Two? Not all marriages break up. Is it even such a great thing, marriage? Even when it works, is it better than just, you know, just being? Pass. And in some ways, without even knowing it, it's like we're already married. I mean, he hates pierced ears, makes him go all funny. You haven't got pierced ears. I have. They've just closed up. Oh. And he hates nail varnish so it's been ages since I've worn anything like that. He never struck me as a control freak. Exactly! Exactly. That's my point. But he has, hasn't he? He's just controlled my life. Just being together... Where are you going? I'm done. You win. Is that what marriage is? Just one long compromise? He makes me laugh, but is that enough? I know he's a good bloke but the world's full of good blokes, and most of them are on wife number three. I don't want to go all bitter and twisted, you know? And I want to be able... If I can, I want to be able to try and forgive him. But is that stupid? I don't want to be one more stupid gullible woman, do I? No. I know that you're single too, but you don't even want to get married, do you? But I've always thought, you know, that one day, no rush, but one day that I would probably... What has he done? Please, just tell me. I'm such a fool. For five minutes there, I thought he was the one. The one true one, or the one you don't mind living with until something better comes along? He was just funny, daft, really annoying, get-on-your-tits Ian, but then I saw that ring and... Love. Big love. It sort of took my breath away love. So... What's changed? What has he done? Oh, for God's sake, Andy. What do you think he's done? So sorry. So sorry. I'm being stupid. Let's go for a drink. No, no, I'm fine. No, you're not. No, no, I'm absolutely fine. No, you're not. No, I just, you know, I just want to be sad and calm and think this through, but I just feel churned up and off my head. Anyway, I'm fine. Got a microwave...microwave meal to ping. See you tomorrow. Franks! Please! Sorry. Frankie! Frankie... Tell them, tell them I can't go anywhere. What's happened? I'll be fine. I'm feeling better. Is it a heart attack? Can you make him understand? He needs to be in cardiac care. Why? What will they do there that you can't do here? This isn't helping, Joseph. No, you have to calm down. You're in charge here. Yeah, well, it doesn't feel like it. Liana... She'll be wondering what the hell's going on. Can you make yourselves a cup of tea? Give him a chance to calm down, and speak to his wife. He doesn't need to worry. I've told her what's happening. I bet you have! OK, this isn't helping, Joe. Try to calm down. OK? There's no rush. Look at me. There's no rush, I'll take you in to see her. You can take my arm, just stop fretting, OK? Ready? Oh, for God's sake! Take him in, then. I'll call ahead to the hospital. Say, what, 20 minutes? OK? Thanks for this, Angie. I was coming anyway. How bad was the heart attack? Not too terrible, I think, but Evans wants to get him into hospital quick-quick. She's being her usual sniffy self. You're doing well. It's going down. My wife's a very good doctor. Hello, Liana, Joseph. We met at your case conference. All we need is a surgeon now and we've involved every NHS department. A psychiatrist - sort your brain out. I am not leaving you. I'll be fine. Where am I going to go? Wherever that ghastly woman sends you. Thanks, Joe, for making me feel like a parcel! You're meant to be keeping calm. He won't do as he's told, Frankie. Never has. Joseph, would you go into cardiac care if it was just for the day? Yes, he would. Hang on! The problem is Dr Evans. Yes. She's wanted Liana in a hospice for the past few weeks. She genuinely thinks it would be for the best. Look, if you agree to go in for the day, we'll find someone to sit with Liana, and if there's a problem, I can do a spell. So can I. And I'll try to get some more Home Care hours. The fearsome Mandy? That's how brave I am. Oh, who am I to argue with so many Amazons? But I'll be back tonight? Yeah, you will. OK. SHE CLEARS HER THROAT So, yeah, he'll be back by this evening but we were just wondering if there was any way maybe you, or your team... Maybe, um... ..any ideas? You could try ripping a hole in the space-time continuum. Or you could shove some rockets up our arses. Light the fuse and stand back. Not even a couple of hours? My ladies were begging the local authority for a couple of hours last week but it couldn't be done. I know. 15 minutes we get for Mr Tucker. 15 minutes for a bed bath and him 20 stone! I'm sorry, yes. Yeah, sorry we can't run in and save your arse. It's just one miserable day! But you don't know that. This mister's had a heart attack, she can't even clear her own throat and you've gone in and promised that we'll look after her at home. Not exactly promised. Yes, you have. I didn't know Joseph was going to have a heart attack. Look, I'm sorry Mandy, I can see you're up to your eyeballs. Sorry. Yeah, I am. You know, Mandy, if I could give all your ladies a 38-hour week and double all your pay... I wish I could. I'll be there this afternoon, when I've done my other calls. I can do till seven, but then I have to be away. Thanks, Mandy. "Thanks for saving my arse, Mandy." Thanks for saving my arse, Mandy. How'd it go? I think we're covered for today. Pulling in every favour and grovelling. You could win over anyone. How does she do it? Mostly bribes. District nursing. Oh, hang on, hang on, love. What do you mean, "mad"? He won't let me in. The door's bolted and they won't do anything. He's not breaking any law. He's wrecking all his furniture. I called my sergeant. It's not an offence. He's shoving all his CDs into black rubbish bags. They're his CDs. It's not an offence. He's pulled the phone out of the wall. Let me guess - it's not an offence. Something must have happened to kick this off. I didn't want to watch Judge Judy. LOUD CRASH My new plasma! Come on. She shouldn't have bothered you lot. Do you think they'll do me? I don't know. God, I'm an idiot. Franks, I've got to go. Dressings clinic. Everything all right? Yeah, we'll be fine, thanks. There's another police car. It's Ian. Sorry. What's this? I've got the shower all rigged up. You'll have to sit on one of your garden chairs, but... Really? We'll have you all spruced up and looking beautiful for when that husband of yours gets back, shall we? He'll think he's come to the wrong house. I warn you now - I'm not great with hair. Nice sort of pairing, isn't it? Nurse and police? Socially responsible. Yeah, you'd think so, wouldn't you? Grown up and boring. We never were. Always doing something - plenty of money, no ties, lots of holidays. And then this happens and suddenly, whoa, it's like... hospital wards and physio and... It's like we'd never really sat down and talked until then. Hmm. Should have broken up months ago. She knows it and so do I. But she's stuck here. Like me. Handicapped. Me by this and her by... I don't know, pity? Do you love her? Sorry? Because it's hard enough when you do. It's impossible when you don't. I mean, you could always just get your window fixed and buy a new telly, stumble on, unhappily ever after. Pretending. I mean, next time, who knows, you might throw her out the window. I would never... No, we stumble along, don't we, you know, doing the washing, and filling the car, and making the best hash of it we can. We never get to that moment, do we, where we go, "Right, decision time. Telly's flying through the air, dreams are trashed, "people are falling off pedestals like skittles. "This is where I take control of my freefall life." Cos no-one's going to do it for us, are they? Right, Mr Hall, I'll have to report it but your partner doesn't want to take it any further. Right. If that thing had hit someone... I know. Or the glass. Yeah. It was... I'm really sorry. You'll have to make a statement. Can I have a word first? Have you tested your sugar? Wait, wait. I forgot the daal. Because I can bet my last penny that you've tasted all of that as you've cooked it. A good chef tastes everything. MasterChef! SHE SPEAKS URDU Cooking doesn't get tougher than this! THEY CHUCKLE Mrs Khan is not well. She's not well. Heart. And, um...and sugar. Do they speak any English at all? They have sons who speak for them. They understand some. Well, they can understand this, then. She's ill. And you can't expect her to wait on you hand and foot. Tell them. They've got to stop treating you like a servant. Thank you. What's he thanking me for? He likes you. You see? You're exhausted. Right. We'll do your test now, shall we? One thing you said that you'd never forgive was unfaithfulness. I said I could forgive it, I couldn't live with it. Right, so where does that leave us? I don't know. Who was the woman? It's no-one you know. I'd got myself so nervous about asking you. I had this perfect night planned in my head. You'd got in some sausage rolls and some balloons. Sorry? You hadn't planned anything wonderful and I didn't do anything terrible. It was nothing! This tiny, miniscule... But that's all it took for you to see this other woman - because any woman will do, apparently - go to bed with her... ..stay the night with her. One mistake, Franks. The first! The only time I've ever not been there for you. There's going to be lots of times like that. Maybe I'll be ill. Or on a course. Or on a hen weekend. What happens if you catch a woman's eye and I'm away for the night, the week? I need a man I can trust. I need a man as strong as me. Where the hell are you going to find that? All right? Ready to give your statement? Yeah. Fine. She dumped me. He dumped me. Either way. We've both been dumped. Good for you. No more freefall, eh? DOG BARKS William! Hi, good to see you. It's good to be home. I bet it is! Yeah. DOG BARKS Hard day at the office? Just the usual. You? Oh, never stopped. HE CHUCKLES Mm, you smell nice. We used everything, didn't we?

Great. See, if we had our admin assistant now, this would all be sorted and we'd just grab it and go. That's you, dancing after one Baileys. Shut up, Karen. Look at me. I'm so cool. Call from Max whatshisface. He won't need a home call today because he's on his way in. Hooray! You didn't see how slaughtered she got on your birthday, did ya? Every cloud. She was wasted. Oh, yeah. Shut your mouth, Karen. What?! Nothing. Just shut up. Andy, can you do the morning meeting, please? Yeah, sure. I don't want her to go to the undertakers. As soon as we get the death certificate, you can arrange her funeral. They'll help with everything. It was very happy, strangely. DOOR OPENS Not at all strange. She had you by her side. What on earth are you doing here? Doctor. I live here. But I sent you to the cardiac unit yesterday. Doctor, please. What happened? He had all the tests and he came home. No, not him. She died. Leave her. What? Leave her. I mean it. Don't touch her again. You can't... This woman was eating, talking, laughing, only yesterday. Can we go into the kitchen? She had weeks in her. Yeah, we thought so. I'll write the death certificate... place and estimated time of death, but I won't do the pink form. What? You need the pink form to arrange the funeral. I'm sorry. I'll be referring this death to the coroner. Why? You've seen her three or four times a week. We know what she's died of. I'm afraid I don't. And the police, of course. I've had to shunt the visits round a bit. Who've I got? All the ones you don't want? I've shared out Frankie's, so we've all got a few extra. Great. Ta. So, look at your lists, and if there are any access problems, like door codes et cetera, make sure you know them before you leave, all right? Power mad. Lead district nurse? I can do it in my sleep. Hello. You wanted an interpreter. Oh, yes! Yes, I do. I can't understand a word these three are saying. She speaks 1950 and they speak "whatevah". You're not seriously suggesting he killed her? They were completely devoted. That much is obvious. Who gave her the last dose of morphine? Angie Rascoe. 8pm. Yeah, another was due at midnight. Joseph would have given her that. We should do an audit. I'm sure he wouldn't have given her... No. You're not. And neither am I. Can't we just...? No. Sorry, of course we can't. I gave her all we had. I couldn't bear the thought of dying before her. Having another coronary and... Joseph, don't say any more. She asked me to do it and I was glad. Stop it, you mustn't talk to us about it. It's all right. You do what you have to do. People are decent. I'm not afraid. If that man had been kept in the cardiac unit, as I suggested, none of this would've happened. He's not sectioned. He was free to walk out, and he did. I've spoken to the consultant. He went home in spite of their best advice. That was his choice. Which he wouldn't have made but for you and all your "support", undermining me. But for us he wouldn't have gone into hospital at all. We had to promise we wouldn't let you bully her into a hospice while he was away. Bully? Thanks. You don't leave two people like that alone. If she'd gone into a hospice a week ago, maybe he wouldn't have had a heart attack! Zoe, don't be a prat. If she'd been taken away a week ago, he'd probably have had his heart attack right then and there. If you're going to phone the coroner, go ahead and do it. You, inside. THEY SPEAK IN URDU She says you... I've done my homework. I know all about the cultural thing. It's the brother-in-laws I need to speak to, but I can't get through to her. You need to explain, those men have no business exploiting her. And who will take out the rubbish? And how is she going to see her grandchildren if they don't take her? Sorry? And do her shopping, clean the windows? Who's going to take her to the day centre? All right, all right. Don't go on. EXASPERATED SIGH SIREN BLARES CAR DOORS SHUT DOORBELL RINGS Excuse me. Sir, can you come into the kitchen, please. Shall I start here? INDISTINCT SPEECH INDISTINCT SPEECH OVER POLICE RADIO Why can't he go upstairs and get some clothes on? I mean, why does he have to sit there in that stupid paper suit like some condemned man? Procedure. This man is grieving. He's just lost his wife. He can get dressed. We've finished upstairs. Right. Good. What happens now? We do our job. You go home and put your feet up. Pretty please. Come on, let's see it, Oran. Here! Come on. That's good, boys. Dave, in the space there. Right, Gary... This way, this way. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Push forward, push forward. He's there, he's there. Come on. Track back! Come on, come on. Heads up. That's it, boys. He's got it, he's got it. Dave, he's there. Give it to him. BUZZER You still here? I've done my bit. I'm just waiting to drive Mr Corden home. We'd do that. No, I'd rather do it. You just going the extra mile again? It's about three, but... I spoke to the DI. They're keeping it low-key. Hm! They came into their house like... Like...what? Like it was a crime scene? Zoe Evans gave a statement. I bet she did. I bet she's loving this. What did the coroner say? Special postmortem. Then it's all over, bar the shouting. And if the morphine overdose is the primary cause of death? Then he's looking at murder or manslaughter. He knew what would happen. He's OK about it. What good is any of this going to do, you know? Well, it's life, and if we don't care enough to protect it... I know. I know. Just...ignore me. BUZZER Miss Maddox, can you join us upstairs, please. Yes. 'I'm doing it all on my own. 'It's taken me an hour to pour the medicine, hasn't it? 'But you did well. 'And it's my own free will. He didn't suggest it, I did. 'I want it. I want champagne, my darling, and my dog. 'I don't want him in one hospital... '..and me in another, and all that... 'Are you all right? Mmm. 'Dr Evans means well, but... 'Shall we have a little rest? 'No, no. I want to do it now, while I still can. 'HE SOBS 'You promised. No tears. 'Where's that bubbly?' DOG BARKS Come on, William. Finished? Come on. Good boy. Good boy. I felt like a fool. She could have told me they were helping her. Did you ask her? It was like banging my head against a brick wall. And the old men just speak Pakistani. God's sake, Mary, Hindustani. They're from Delhi, in India. The same thing. Barely a word of English between all three of them. She teaches it. What? She teaches English as a foreign language. I thought you knew. Mrs Khan? Mrs Khan in a little terraced house? Jeez, try reading the notes. I've not had the chance. I looked at her clinic records. You're a right snob, Mary McCloud. You just see a foreign name and the shutters come down. That's more racist than snob, isn't it? Oh, send me off to a Gulag. Re-educate me. Sue me! Honestly! So, what's she going to do if she doesn't cook? Sit at home and watch the box? What good'll that do? Fine. Mrs Khan knows best. Ethnics are wonderful. Diversity's everything. They're saints! They are, they're total saints! And the poor idiot, hard-working Englishwoman's in the wrong. Again. Did you coach them? What? I just had a call from DI Kennedy. The medicine bottle was wiped clean of every fingerprint and then her prints went on. The medicine glass likewise. Wiped clean of every print and then hers went on it. Right. How did she manage that? I don't know. Because we both know she wasn't up to it, don't we? Not without help. Her husband wiped everything clean and put everything ready, and made sure she could reach. He may not have lifted it to her lips, but we know. What do the police say? It still has to go to the coroner, but the primary cause of death is natural causes, so he's unlikely to face any charges. The CPS won't see any point. Right. Well, if no-one killed her, and she didn't kill herself... He tried to kill her! No, she asked the man she loved to help her and he did. There's a difference. SHE SIGHS It must be so comfortable in your head... where you're so sure of everything. I know my patients. I know what she wanted and why he did what he did. You engineered her death. You encouraged him not to go into cardiac care and she knew he'd never get the treatment he needed if it meant leaving her. She left first. She sacrificed herself for him. And you helped her. No. Don't think this is the end of it. But if the CPS are not prosecuting... For you. Don't think it's the end of it for you. I'm going to make sure it isn't. 'They are little kids. Don't tell me about kids. 'Oh, come on, you two...give them something they want, and not nits.' You tell 'em, B. Attagirl. Ow, ow, ow! Ah! Ow! Hello. Hey, Angie. You slumming it? Looks like it. Got you your usual, Franks. Angie... Oh, no, I'll get it. Oh, a white wine. Thanks, Paula. I've got to get off. Family to feed and all that. Doesn't that sound lovely? In a Stepford Wives sort of way. Don't set her off again. We've had the "political correctness gone mad" tirade for the last hour. Yes, all right, thank you. I know I'm a dinosaur and my views aren't welcome here. Don't be like that, come on. Oh, let her go. There's only so much Mary I can take at the end of a long day. Do you realise, she's the only one of us with someone waiting at home? You'll kiss and make up soon enough. You reckon? Mm. Hey. Nice nails. Not too much? Very subtle. Classy. And your ears... OK, OK, no big deal. Thanks, love. Come on, then. We're going to head off too, aren't we? Yeah. Yeah. Indian and then the clubs. Skulking off before she shames herself again. You weren't even here. I heard all about it, though. What, my birthday party? Did you pull? No. She so did! She's blushing! Come on! Who did you get off with? No-one! Yeah, right. She got off with someone. Mystery man. Oh, I hope it was worth it. There wasn't anyone. I went home. Question is, with who? Right, enough chat. Get those down you and I'll get some more in. Or are we going to go on to cocktails? Ooh, please. Franks? Slippery nipple, or is it just the way you're sitting? If you're begging me for another try, the answer's yes. Paula got wasted at my party. She was late in on Monday and she won't look me in the eye. HE SIGHS You-you told me it was someone I didn't know. Oh, my God! I'm right, aren't I? Aren't I? Yeah? You and her, of all people. You absolute bastard. I was drunk and I was angry and...and she was... Available, yeah. That's reason enough, isn't it? She's 22. I'm her line manager. No! You're a bastard, you. You give me my key. Give me my key. Frankie, please, listen. Don't touch me, right! Listen. Listen. I told her. I told her and she understood. Give me my key. TEARFULLY: Give me my key. Give me my key! SHE SINGS ALONG TO TRACK: ♪..Love, love, love ♪ It must be love ♪ Love... ♪ Nothing more, nothing less ♪ Love is the best... ♪ Nothing's the best ♪ Love is the best... ♪ DOOR BUZZER ♪..How can it be that we can say so much without... ♪ Emergency pack. Guaranteed to put bad men back in their boxes where they belong. I didn't know. But then tonight, the penny dropped. So sorry, mate. Nobody else knows. Promise. Let them all know. Come on, then. You letting us in? Who's for some naan? ♪ And may you ♪ Never lay your head down ♪ Without a hand to hold ♪ And may you never make your bed ♪ Out in the cold ♪ You're just like a great, strong brother of mine ♪ And you know that I love you true. ♪ I'm not allowed to treat any patients? It's only Dr Evans who's complaining, not her partners. I'm sorry, Frankie. You don't deserve this. This is, er, Matthew Seren, everyone, the new administrator, co-ordinator and receptionist. Some bastard is parked in my space. I'll sodding do 'em. HORN BLARES Why?! Frankie Maddox has administered drugs to one of my patients. Richard? He could be dying somewhere. What have you taken? What? How many did you take? I'm just falling apart, Andy. Should we be discussing personal lives? If they mean we make unwise professional decisions. You're making a mess of everything. You do you know that? Yeah, with a little help from my friends.
