 Frankie (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 4 - Episode #1.4 - full transcript 
 Andy's patient Cheryl Fripp is worried when her daughter Bea,who has Downs Syndrome,announces that she and her disabled boyfriend Jake Gibson plan to move in together and the stress brings on an asthma attack which hospitalizes her. Andy manages to get Dr Evans on side to work out a compromise agreeable to all parties whilst cash-strapped Karen has trouble getting through to grumpy old Clive,who refuses to let people in his house though she succeeds by flattery. Frankie visits pregnant ex-hippie Rachel Ellis,desperate for a child after several miscarriages. Fear of another drives her husband Toby away but he ultimately returns to hear his wife's good news. Frankie deigns to listen to Ian but any reconciliation is blown away when Paula announces that she is carrying Ian's baby. Furthermore Frankie appears to have a stalker.

 A woman is dead and it's down to you. I'm not allowed to treat patients? It's only Dr Evans who is complaining. Not her partners. I like Frankie, I like Ian. They're made for each other. If you've broken them up... This is Matthew Seren everyone, our new administrator, co-ordinator, and receptionist. I don't think he needs any encouragement. No-one wants this to go to the Nursing and Midwifery Council unless it has to. I am sorry your boyfriend is attracted to me but...

 You'd better leave now. OK, you're making a mess of everything. No case to answer! Kicked out of court! You're back on the treadmill, missus! RADIO: "Wake Up Boo!" by The Boo Radleys. ♪ Wake up it's a beautiful morning ♪ The sun is shining before your eyes ♪ Wake up, it's a beautiful... ♪ Never fear. Nurse Frankie is here! You're not ill? No, I'm on top of the world, me. But what about that stuff that you found at the back of the cupboard? Evil, evil stuff. Yeah, the orange, fermented liqueur? Yeah, yeah, I brought that back from Greece... Poisoned by holiday schnapps. Fancy a fry up?

 That's it. You'll feel much better after a trip to Chuggington. I was nearly sick in the taxi going home. I'm surrounded by lightweights. Orange juice and lemonade. Sugar to stop the shakes and fizz to settle the stomach. I swear by eggs. He needs carbohydrates. OK, eggs and super noodles. And peppermint tea. Where's Karen? What you looking at me for? I'll call her. The community midwife just called. Rachel Ellis, six weeks pregnant, got taken into hospital last night. Her ovarian hyperstimulation symptoms got worse. That's not good. Is that your IVF case? Yeah, I was hoping to treat her symptoms at home. She's got a six week scan on Friday and could do without the stress. Karen's car has broken down and she's on the bus. Hey, Karen, where are you? OK, get off on Church Road and visit Clive Harvey. 67. Chronic renal failure, possible leg ulcer. It's a five minute walk from the bus stop. Bye-bye, thank you. Bye-bye. How are you going to manage without your car? I'll be fine. Hey, Ravey Rach! I hope you're not listening to anything too raucous. Nothing with a repetitive beat. Whale music. Meant to be calming. Is it working? I feel like a bloody whale. It's just fluid retention. Keep up the peeing. The nurses get very excited whenever I do. They take it away and measure it. Well, we've got to get our thrills somehow. The good news is your symptoms are easing and your swollen tummy is coming down. Final round of IVF so they put me on a ward full of newborn babies. I just want to go home. Let's break you out of here. If only. Already arranged. Just had a chat with your consultant. Said we need you in tiptop condition for that scan on Friday, so swing them legs out, girl. Oh, lovely! < Who is it? Mr Harvey? I'm Karen, a community nurse. Your GP's asked me to visit. What do you want? Just to see if you're OK. It would be good if you could open the door. I've had enough of you busybodies. Mr Harvey... Bugger off. I'll come back later. Hi. Hello, gorgeous. How are you? Working. I'd love to see you in your uniform again. 'We could go somewhere quiet in your squad car.' Listen, I'm snowed under today with paperwork at the station. Well, I'll come to you then. You can introduce me to your colleagues. No. Why not? Oh, listen. I've got to go. Sorry. I don't know what the consultant is on about. CID or whatever he said. COPD. Never heard of it. Unfortunately that does'nae mean you have'nae got it. It's Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. I'm just a bit chesty. You sound terrible. And you look terrible. Thanks very much. Right, where's your inhaler? It was on the settee. You're always losing it. You need to look after yourself better, love. You're not a spring chicken any more. Hello, Andy. Hey, Bea. He's got a hangover. I have not. I'm going out, Mum. Where? To see Jake. I don't want you seeing him. Who's Jake? She thinks she's got a boyfriend. Bloody ridiculous. Is this your telly remote? That's where it went! Aha! Ventolin. Bea's got this new key worker. Katie or Carly or something. Carly... Only known her five minutes and she's filling her head with all kinds of rubbish. She never cared about boyfriends before. You're getting yourself worked up about this aren't you? No-one listens to me, Andy. Show me you know how to use this. Look, we have to continue working together so let's try and be professional, yes? If only you could. Oh, I could but it's so boring. It's just a joke. What's your problem? I don't have a problem. I love my job. It's not my fault if you don't feel the same way about yours. What? Hi, come in. Hi, you all right? Where is she? She's upstairs in bed. That's what I like to hear. Have you got a day off work? I'm supposed to be working from home but I've spent the day cleaning instead. I thought she might like it. Bathroom? Oven. Sounds serious. I don't think I've ever cleaned my oven. Oh, it's, erm, it's stupid really. I didn't know what else to do. I'll show you up. I didn't look after myself for years. She was a wild child. And you had a lot of fun too? Yeah, yeah, we did. They said I was pregnant both times before and there was no heartbeat at the six week scan. There's no connection between that and partying. Really? How do you know? Believe me, I've seen women do worse to their bodies than you and it hasn't made a bit of difference to whether they carry a baby or not. So, you mustn't beat yourself up. OK? What about...? It's just fluid build up. A side effect of the IVF. OHSS is no risk to your pregnancy, I promise you. I've been trying to do all the right things, haven't I? Yeah. No wine, no sugar. Nothing fun at all for ages. She lives entirely on organic vegetables. I'm so boring. Oh, come on. I didn't say that. Hey, at least you've got a very clean kitchen, which is more than I can say. I've, erm, I've just done a bit of cleaning downstairs, that's all. Why? I thought it might help. How? I want you to make sure you come straight home from school today. A cup of tea might be nice! No excuses this time. I've only walked about 25 miles this morning. You are not staying out until all hours again. Don't put yourselves out. Will your car be fixed by tomorrow? Do I look like a mechanic? Hope? I'll make my own tea, then. Coffee, two sugars. I'll have a camomile. Thanks for the lift. It's not for your benefit. I've a schedule to maintain. Are you allowed in the bus lane? Yeah, I'm disabled. Yeah, does that mean you're allowed in the bus lane? Well, it bloody well should do! So what's up with this car, anyway? It's the engine. Which bit of the engine? The bit that makes it go. Is it the crankshaft, is it the bearings, the gasket, the spark plugs, loss of suction? The last one. That is vacuum cleaners. What is this? A test? I'm just trying to help. You can drop me here. What? I'll walk the last bit. But we're miles away. Are you all right? Fine. A delicious combination of milk chocolate and caramel on an oaty biscuit base. I can't eat them all on my own. You're not coming in. I need you to do me a little wee in this. I'm not doing that. Pass it back to me and I'll test it on the doorstep. I know she's been worrying since your dad died but she's just trying to keep you safe. Your mum's really not well. You know? Her lungs are very weak so you've got to try and not to stress her out when you're at home. It's not my fault. She doesn't trust anyone. She doesn't trust me. So tell us about this boyfriend then? I want to move in with him. I know, but that's a big step. Come and meet him. He's lovely. All right then, you lead the way. Mr Harvey? Thank you! You've got protein in your wee. I really need to come in and see you. No. Why don't you just come out here for five minutes? And then will you get out of my property? I absolutely will. Hi, Jake. Hey. Hey, Bea. Hey, how's it going? All right. Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Nice to see you. Yeah, you too. This is Andy. He used to look after my dad when he was dying. How's it going? Nice to meet you, Jake. So how long have you two been together? Since Valentine's Day. I gave her the biggest card in the shop. Nice work. I'm worth it! What would you like to do this evening? Shall we go to the cinema? Yeah, I think we can do that. Go and see a comedy or something. Bea, I'm just going to go and have a wee word with Carly. See you later. Nice meeting you, Jake. See ya. The problem is that the urine is keeping it infected. You just want to wrap me up in nappies do you? No, I want to help you. I think you have a bladder infection and that's probably adding to your incontinence. You need antibiotics to sort this out but because of your kidney problems we have to administer them very carefully. What's the point? I'm falling to bits anyway. Do you know what you are? A miserable old bugger. Apart from that. What? You're the stuff every district nurse's dreams are made of. You're a complete project. Am I? We fight over patients like you. A project, eh? I like a project. Do you? Why's that? Because I was an engineer. What did that involve? Making things. Aeroplanes mostly. You can make aeroplanes? I can make anything out of anything. When I come back will you let me in? I haven't had a woman in the house since 1977. What happened to her? She's buried under the floorboards. I'll take my chances! Jake lives in sheltered accommodation. There's a room free for Beatrice. Has this been discussed with her mother? Yes, of course, but she won't talk to any of us. How hard have you tried? Andy, she's a different generation. Come on Carly, isn't that a wee bit patronising? I'm not the one being patronising! What about what Beatrice wants? Are we just going to ignore that because she's got Down's Syndrome? Listen, there's no reason why she can't lead a very independent life, given the right support. So, how are things with Ian? I'm over him. Right. What's that mean? All I said was "right". Well, maybe I'm not. One minute I am over him and next minute I'm not over him and then... I can see why you drink. I know! All this thinking about it is doing my bloody head in. How are you? I met this great couple today. Love's young dream. What's their secret? No idea. They do buy giant Valentine's cards. You see, that's where I've been going wrong all these years! But the mother and daughter are at loggerheads and I just really don't want to get involved. More emotional women and their problems? Exactly. You see, my life is very tough. Women are just drawn to confide in me. You see, that's your fault, you remind us of our dads! What are you going to do? I'm just going to be very clear. You know, medical problems? Fine. Happy to help. Family arguments? Not my remit. I'm glad we've cleared that up. Now I can drink you under the table again. You did not drink me under the table. Did. Not. I did. Shut it. I'm so cool! Karen! What do you want? Thought you might like a lift in. Are you all right? It's really hard at the moment with my parents away. It's a massive house and I'm all alone in it. Must be awful. And I haven't really made any friends at work. Well, sleeping with the boss's boyfriend will do that. You don't understand how hard my life is, Karen. What the hell have you got to moan about? I'm sorry. It's just, I've got money problems... I'm pregnant. What? I just found out. Ian's? It'll be all right. It happened to me once when I wasn't being careful. Everything will be all right. I'm not getting a termination. What are you going to do then? Me and Ian are going to have the baby. Is that what he said? Well, he doesn't know yet. I'm going to see him today. Don't do it to yourself. You were a one-night stand. You're going to mess up your whole life. Do you want a lift or not? If you're not coping financially I can lend you some money. I don't want your money. Any nausea or vomiting? I just keep crying. OHSS is horrible. Your hormones are in overdrive. The scan's tomorrow. If I'm not going to be a mother, then what am I going to be? You're still going to be you. Ha! I've done everything I can to have a baby. Moved area, lost all my old friends. You know, I'm not Ravey Rach any more... I don't know who I am now. It will be devastating if it doesn't work out, I know, but you and Toby, you'll still have each other. But I have to have this child. He's a good bloke. Plus, he loves you. Bonus! Yeah, Rach? OHSS is a good sign though isn't it? It means I'm still pregnant. It doesn't necessarily mean that. I think this baby is growing. Yeah, I really do. Right, come on, cup of tea. Kettle's on! How are you doing? Yeah. Stressful time. Where are your tea bags? I don't know what scares me most any more - what life will be like if we fail again or what it will be like if we don't. Spike Island. 1990. Stone Roses gig. Those were good times Well, there's good times still to come. Not the same, but still good. You reckon? Yeah. You've just got to show her, that's all. How? RADIO: "I Want to Know What Love Is by Foreigner Yes? Oh, hello. Thanks for answering. What do you want? Just wanted to see how you were. Fine. Will you come and have lunch with me? No. You're telling me you don't want a change from sarnies and crisps? Something exotic? I don't, no. A revolution in gastronomy? That chemical fusion place. ICI? Oh, um, Heston...oh, you know, er... Blumenthal. Heston Services. Is that it? Cos I'm working. I love you, Frankie. Bye-Bye. All right, stop going on. I'm quite happy to tell you what it is. Go on, then. Love is a "one year out" Ken Bruce T-shirt. Everyone knows that. Hey Bea, how's things? She won't stop doing housework. Yeah? Hey, you. You're supposed to be taking things easy. I need to keep things the same. You're not well enough. That will be Jake. Hey Bea. You got your suitcase all set up? Yes. Cool. What's he doing here? He's come to help me pack my stuff. He is not. She is moving in to our spare room so you can have a break. We're going to share a bedroom. We agreed. That's not up to you. Tell her, Andy. Oh, no. I'm not getting involved in this. I'll sleep with him if I want to, Mum. We're careful, Mrs Fripps. We know all about contraception. I forbid you from seeing him. I'm not a child. I'm not an idiot. I love him. You're all right. I want you to sit down and lean forward over this. Take deep breaths, try and slow your breathing down. Bea, can you find your mum's inhaler for me, please? Yeah, ambulance. Hi Carly, it's Andy Peat here. Listen, Beatrice Fripp's mother's had to go into hospital. Beatrice and Jake are at home. Can you come round ASAP, please? Thanks. She's going to be all right. She just got herself a wee bit worked up. I'm going to stay with you until Carly gets here. You don't have to wait. I'll look after her, mate. We'll be fine. I've got Jake. We'll phone you if we need to. Promise? Yeah, we promise. Promise. Mr Harvey, it's Karen. It's, erm, it's a bit of a mess. Don't worry about that. You should see my place. I share with students. I have been meaning to clear it up... Is there anywhere I can sit? You can't keep yourself healthy, living like this. I don't know where to start. Start today. If we're going to sort you out, you have to meet me halfway. Nitrous Oxide. You told me you bunked off chemistry lessons... I had to look it up. OK. I'll...I'll meet you for ten minutes in the park. No longer. And bring a sandwich. I brought all your favourites. What's happening between you and Paula? Nothing. I'm trying to extricate myself. Extricate? I don't want to be a shit. Well, it's a bit late for that. I know. But I'm not interested in her. It was a massive mistake. Then stop being a coward and just end it. I love you. Prove it. Man up. Lovely view. What's happened to the radio? Have you fallen out with Ken Bruce? Do you know nothing? He finished an hour ago. I've had a hellish morning. See, women are a total nightmare. Oh, here's another. Can't a woman have a minute's peace? What's going on here? A secret meeting? I've lost about two stone with all this walking. Are you eating all of those? Help yourself. Saw Hope in town. What? When was this? Just now. Window shopping in the city centre. Has she got a day off school? Oh, dear. Carly, it's Andy again. Will you call me back, please? You can't just walk into my work. Well you're ignoring all my texts and calls, what am I supposed to do? This has to stop. What do you mean? I should never have slept with you. I promise that I won't come to your work again. No, no, it's not going anywhere. It is going somewhere. Look, you're a really lovely girl but I'm still in love with Frankie. This is over. It was never going anywhere to begin with. I'm really sorry. I'm pregnant. What? It's yours. How? How do you think? But you said it was safe. Yeah, well, I'm sorry. You're a bloody nurse, for Christ's sake! How did you get pregnant by accident? Hope, if I have to call you again I'm going to be very angry. Right, who's nicked them? What? My biscuits. There was a packet in there. Maybe I left them at my desk. Hello? Yeah, I'll hold. Taking the biscuits, Karen? That is just downright wrong. They were for a patient. Don't tell him. What is the story with your car? What? Tell me the truth and I'll let you run away before he comes back. Cheryl? What is it? Have I got a treat for you! Support stockings! Whoo-hoo-whoo! What is it? He's gone. I can't believe he walked out the day before the scan. We had a big row. Yeah, I bet you did. You won't believe what he's done. Try me. He went and bought tickets for a bloody festival. What? Can you believe that? I mean, what was he thinking of? He's knows I'm not that person any more. He says he wants us to be like we used to be. What the hell does that mean? I don't think he even likes me any more. I don't even know if he wants this baby. So it's over. I'm so sorry. He won't come with me tomorrow and there's no-one else I can take. No-one who can handle it if it's... bad news. You want me to come with you? Thank you. It will be OK. Carly, it's Andy again. Beatrice and Jake are not at the house. Where are you? Andy! Call me back. Jake, Jake, where's Beatrice? We had a row. I know. She called her mum at the hospital. She wanted us to go to bed. I wanted to watch telly, she got upset. Said I didn't love her, which I do. And then we went into town and had another row at the bus stop. You went all the way into town? I made a mistake, all right. I thought it might cheer her up. OK. Where is she now? I don't know. I left her behind. What? Jake? She told me to eff off. Right. Have you got her mobile number? Yeah, of course. Find her, please. Hello? Hi, Bea, it's Andy. Where are you, darling? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Don't be scared, Bea. Can you see any street names? No. I want my mum. Yeah, and I'm going to take you to her. So I want you to look around. What can you see? Boats. Water. Great. Anything else? There's a big bridge and railings. Right. I know where you are so don't move. Jake and I are coming to get you, OK? I'm looking to refer Clive Harvey to Social Services. Living conditions indicate senile squalor syndrome and he's generally not coping. Thanks. We've a problem. Karen's car's been repossessed. I told you that in confidence. Well, she needs to know. Yeah, I do. What's going on, Ka? I got behind on my repayments. Ridiculous. Excuse me? I've run a whole family on my salary. You need to learn to budget. I'm sorry. I got lost, Mum. Don't worry, love, you're safe now. Are you all right, Jake? Bea's not talking to me. I let her down. The thing is, women, right, they need to feel loved. I just wanted to watch the footie. I just needed a break. I know. I just don't understand them. Have you got any condoms? Not on me, no. I keep running out. I'll be back in a minute. OK. Can I have a word? Yeah, sure. It was lucky I found her. Oh, come on, she had a panic attack, that's all. If she gets away from her mother her confidence will increase. Where were you? I have a lot of clients. I was busy. Just because you want them to be capable of living independently doesn't mean they are. Andy, I know what I'm doing. I wasn't going to get involved in this but... I think I need to. And why's that? Because I'm the only person working with this family that actually seems to know them. I'm going to arrange a professionals' meeting. Fine. And by the way, Jake's run out of johnnies. Bath and a beer for me. Manana, ladies. How bad? What? Your finances. I've messed up. I can ask Emma for some extra hours. Thanks. You going home? I promised I'd call in on Mr Harvey first. You're a good nurse, Karen. Don't blow it. What do you want? I tried to get her to understand that there was more to our life than just wanting a baby. But she doesn't want to know. There seems a lot more to your life. Please, don't say anything to her. It was just a fling. I didn't plan it. She really needs you with her. I can't do it. I can't sit in that room again while they look for a baby that isn't there. I'm just not strong enough. I told her that if there was no baby then at least she had you. I told her you were a good man. I am a good man. Good night, Toby. Just making sure you eat properly. Chips? And a battered sausage. You got a problem with that? What do you think? £16, please. How much? It's, er, rush-hour traffic, love. Look, that's all I've got left. You said you were going to tidy up. I can't be expected to work my fingers to the bone. All you had to do was clear one room. One bit! I work bloody hard. I turn up day in and day out to look after people like you. I bring you biscuits, I wash you and you can't even be bothered to clear a chair so I can sit down. I've had my car taken off me because I'm broke. And I've spent the last of my money on a taxi trying to get out here. What for? You don't even want to get better. I need to check your dressing. Sit down. He's having an affair and not only that, he's not going to turn up for this scan tomorrow. Yes, definitely a bad man. Well, I'm going to have to tell her. Never mind what happens with the pregnancy. Really? What if there's no heartbeat? He's cheating on her. So at what point are you going to break this news? I mean, how many minutes afterwards exactly? Are you going to wait for her to stop sobbing about never becoming a mother first...? Oh, it could be tricky. You going to get that? Otherwise engaged. 'It's me. 'I really need to talk to you, Frankie. 'Please? Call me back, any time.' Hello, is that Lakeisha's mother? Hi, this is Hope's mum. Yeah, I got a text saying that she was having a sleepover at yours? Could I talk to her, please? Well, could you get her to call me as soon as she gets in, please? Thanks. No, no, no, it doesn't matter how late it is. It's my mum. Hope, who's that? It was nobody. See you in a bit. You not coming in? I've just got to go and meet someone. Are you all right? Please could you lend me some money, to get a cheap second-hand car? This has to be brief. We need to sort things out. Yeah, yeah. What would you rather have, a girl or a boy? This changes everything between us. No, no, it doesn't. You can't make me get rid of it. I know. I never said that. But if it was Frankie's baby you'd want it, wouldn't you? I thought I was going to die. Oh, you're not going anywhere yet. I'm going to go before she does, though, aren't I? Yes, you probably are. What am I going to do? What do you want for her? Do you want her to be alone when you're gone? Hey. Let's get a cuppa. Come on. We've got lots of time. What do you fancy? Hot chocolate? Frappo-appo-ccino? Maybe we'll get lucky and the machine will do rum and coke. So, high-functioning young woman with Down's syndrome wishes to live in sheltered housing with her boyfriend. Mother's diagnosis means that she's no longer able to care for her. It's an open-and-shut case surely? I agree. So, what's the issue? I've known the family for a number of years and the situation is just much more complicated than that. Mr Harvey, I'm really, really sorry about yesterday. I don't know what happened. I've never spoken to a patient like that before. I'm really sorry. Call me Clive. So you can sit. It's a work in progress. I should shout at men more often. I made you a present. You made that? Hmm, to apologise. It's beautiful. We've always done everything together. You look really happy there. Yeah. I'd like to be happy again. Rachel Ellis? I feel sick. Not on this uniform. It's the only clean one I've got. You've blindly taken the mother's side. This isn't about taking sides. We need to think about the future for both of them. I'm not compromising on my client's human rights. You need to get off your high horse and start working with me on this. I entirely agree. You do? Well, don't look so surprised. I do occasionally agree with my colleagues. OK, what do you suggest then? Right. Beatrice stays at Jake's two days of the week and we see how it goes. In the meantime, we get Cheryl help at home so she feels fully involved in her daughter's care because if you take Beatrice away her health will definitely decline. Why will it? She can spend more time on herself, she could develop a hobby. Because she lives for her daughter. That sounds like a good compromise. Everyone agreed? Carly? Yeah. Thanks, Carly. Oh, well done! Oh! Oh! Go on! Hey, Ian. What you doing later? Do you like him? Is he going to look after you? Of course he will. All right, take him a piece of cake. There you are. Don't eat too much. I won't. She doesn't half boss him around. I cannae imagine who she gets that from(!) Cheeky! Me and Carly are going to make it work for you both. She was my beautiful little fat baby. They said she'd never grow up. ♪ Happy birthday to me! ♪ I didn't tell her. Of course you didn't. You never would have. Hey, fancy going out tonight? Got other plans, sorry. Oh, well, your loss. You'd have probably cramped my style anyway. Style?! Sorry, didn't know you had any. Hey! Night. Night. What is it? I'm pregnant. What? Ian doesn't want it. Ian? It was an accident. Was it? I promise. I only slept with him twice. You are a selfish, silly cow. I'm sorry, I didn't... It's going to be OK. It's going to be all right. What are you doing? You invited me around. I've just spent the last hour being cried on by your 22-year-old pregnant girlfriend. Strange you didn't mention that. Please... It's over. You have completely blown this. And there is no coming back. He's in here every day, looking for you, and at the same time someone is sending you these videos and texts. If you're that concerned, you can stay the night. There is something I need to tell you. If you want my advice don't sound so keen when he calls. Shane, I'm not racing you. How I treat my MS is my choice. But you're not treating it. Shouting at patients, breaking confidentiality, and managing to walk away from the wreckage, looking like a hero. We can fix this, together. Well, I'm not giving up on you yet. I'll see you next week? As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.
