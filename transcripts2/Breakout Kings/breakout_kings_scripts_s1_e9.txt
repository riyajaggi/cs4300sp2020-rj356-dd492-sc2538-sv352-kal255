Yeah, well, there's three of them and one of me. Yeah, well, you go in hard, you surprise them, huh? You could take these humps.

 You'd do the same for me, huh? GUARD [OVER PA]: Last call for p.m. school. Last call for p.m. school. [GUARDS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] GUARD: The commissary will be closing in 10 minutes. [ALARM RINGS] ANDRE: I got your back. [ALL GRUNTING] OFFICER: Backup. Someone call for backup. [ALARM RINGING] OFFICER: Lock it down. Lock it down. REV: Andre. Agh! [MEN SHOUTING] REV: Andre. Unh!

 Andre. Agh! You bastard. - Let's go, let's go. - "Snitch" is with a "T," by the way. OFFICER: Convicts, on the ground. Hands in the air. Convicts, on the ground. Hands in the air. If that door ain't open in two seconds, you're on your own. Let's go. Let's go. ANDRE: Are you sure you brought everything? [ALARM RINGING] FUENTES: Come on. Move your ass. ANDRE: This.... This better hold. [TIRES SCREECHING] - Baby, I am so proud of you. - Heh. Helping out the U.S. Marshals, not in a million years-- Hey, you're getting out early because of it. That's all I care about. No, you're right. You're right. So the people you're working with, they're nice? I guess they're all right, for cops. Heh. And the other informants? Hey, hey, hey, I ain't no informant. I didn't mean it like that. I haven't given them dick on anyone I used to run with. They just bounce stuff off me, that's all. Shea, you're the same man that I've always known. Nothing has changed. If anything, I love you more now, because you're doing what is right by us. Baby, when we're together again... ...we're gonna be free and clear, no more running. We can't go back to that. [BELL RINGING] [SIGHS] Hey, you smell good. I wish we could be alone. You don't even wanna know what you go through... ...to get into one of them conjugal trailers. No way I'm having any CO take a rubber glove to you. OFFICER: Daniels, no excessive contact. Daniels. [SCOFFS] I want you, baby. - Let me figure something out. - My man. OFFICER: Daniels, transpo van is here. Andre Brennan. Escaped while his cellie basically started a riot. - Started it as a distraction? - We'll never know. His cellie's dead. - How'd he escape? - Warden's doing an investigation. He was in for tax evasion... ...but has been a suspected associate of the Bad Elvises. Anyone? A ring of international jewelry thieves. - Never caught. - Correct. They're known for sophisticated methods, advanced materials... ...coded communications, and they are violent. Jewelry store in Brussels two years ago, heist gone wrong. Guards never stood a chance. Interpol never pinned it on him, but we know he was the mastermind. Wait, can we go back? Bad Elvises. Could they do no better for a name? They were given the name by the press... ...after a heist where they all wore ridiculous pompadour wigs. - That's no excuse. - Now, Breakout Kings... ...that's a name that got ring. - Is that what they're calling us? - I love it. - We're not called Breakout Kings. - Why not? Because we're not breaking out of anything. You know what? Don't worry about it. Hello, blue eyes. Come to Mama. He's got a Park Avenue address, a boat... ...a Bentley flyer, whoa, he was living the high life. Must've been thieving for a long time before they caught him. RAY: Want time with the files, or are you ready to do work? I don't know, Ray. Have you seen the folder on this guy's conjugal visitors? It's amazing. Shea, would I be correct in referring to this gentleman... ...as a player with mad game, yo? Yeah, back in the '80s. Check this out. This just came from the warden's office. A tip of a copied key found inside the lock on the visitors' area. - What the hell's that made out of? ERICA: Plastic. Melted-down toothbrush, most likely. SHEA: He got that copy from somebody. I'd be talking to trustees and guards, see who knew him. Take a trip to the prison. SHEA: Charlie. Uh.... - Yeah. Think we could talk about me getting some alone time with my girl? Anything else you need? Uh, candlelight, bubble bath? I'm just looking for a little time. You are getting time. Time off your sentence. Other than that, you get nothing. Do your job. On our way there, run every trustee. Anybody that's had contact with him. Also pull his visitation log. Andre's up to something. I wanna know what. [MEN CHATTERING] That's some bad luck, huh? The key breaks off in the lock, we would've never looked into you. Lots of trustees like me are around keys, boss. Hate to break it to you, but you're gonna have to keep looking. How many trustees have wives... ...that make 9 dollars an hour folding laundry... ...and go out and buy a brand-new Escalade, cash? She got taken on the upholstery and leather insurance. You never get that. I told her two days ago to sit on the money for a year... ...and she goes out and buys an Escalade? Fuentes, just tell us everything you know. We don't go after your wife for aiding and abetting... ...and as a conspirator. I'm gonna kill her. I'm seriously gonna kill her. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] Now. Andre gave me 25 grand to make a copy of a key. Come on. The rig cost more than 25k. I told Andre I needed another week, and he just about blew a gasket. He said he needed to be out by this morning... ...and he'd double my price. - Why the hurry? FUENTES: I don't know. His wheels were always turning, you know? Where is he headed? Where is he going? FUENTES: Probably female-related. You should have saw some of the tomatoes that would come to visit him. It was like a Victoria's Secret catalog. I mean, I'd say, "Andre, who's that knockout?" I don't know how he did it. He is well-endowed. I guarantee it. JULIANNE: How can you tell? [STAMMERS] I mean, I don't care. It's just, you know, you said that.... Ray. Yes. I'm here. He's confident yet calm. He doesn't need to resort to all the nonsense... ...guys do that need to compensate. He knows what he's got. Look at that expression. It's like, "Whatever. I don't need to make a big deal out of it. You know why? Hmm? Because I'm packing." - All that from a mug shot? - Yes. Not because you haven't had a conjugal in years... ...and you're starting to hallucinate? Maybe a little. I thought it was, ahem, not the size of the liner, but the motion of the ocean. Who told you that, Lloyd? And please, don't say your mother. - I read an article in Psychology Today. - Uh-huh. Will do. Right away. Ahem. Andre paid a lot of money to be out today. So Charlie and Ray want us looking into anything time-sensitive... ...and who were his most recent female contacts. Kate Lavin. Andre is a man who lives for instant gratification... ...his vanity, his trappings of wealth... ...his self-satisfaction... ...derived from theorized physical attributes. He's a walking id. And he clearly suffers from Persistent Ego-Aggrandizing Disorder. So his first order of business getting out of jail will follow that suit. Meaning what? - He needs to get laid. LLOYD: Correct. And of all his lady callers, Kate visited him the most in jail... ...including one conjugal. Of course I know Andre. Obviously, you know that or you wouldn't be here. - How'd you meet? - He used to date a friend of mine. He took her on trips around the world. They lived like royalty. Then she moved to Seattle, and then Andre asked me out for sushi... ...and I fell under his spell, I suppose. You know about his criminal background? Oh, the jewelry thing? Yeah, I--I heard the rumors. CHARLIE: Heard the rumors, huh? But if you're asking me... ...if I personally witnessed him stealing valuables... ...the answer's no. We just had a good time. You visited him three times in prison. What was that about? Well, I felt sorry for him. Plus, I'd never had a conjugal visit in prison... ...so I thought I'd check that off my list. We're not here to listen to your sexual shenanigans. Save that for your girlfriends over a martini. This guy just escaped from prison. We wanna know where the hell he is and what he's up to. Unless you're helping him evade arrest. - No. No, I'm not. RAY: Good. Then give us something we could use. [SIGHS] A month ago, Andre asked me to wait for him... ...and run away to New Mexico. His uncle has a spread out there, apparently. But I felt it was all a bit desperate, so I declined. That's the last time I saw him. That's the truth. Nice luggage. Going somewhere? Just returned. - I'm seeing someone else now. - Right. KATE: Good luck. In case he asks you out to sushi again. Thanks. Anything on New Mexico? His uncle? Still looking. The uncle must be his mother's brother. - So Kate was just one of his lovers? CHARLIE: Apparently. Why do you have that dazed look? She's mungry. Man hungry. CHARLIE: Snap out of it. Hey, real quick. Ahem. Did this Kate happen to make any comments about Andre's...? [WHISTLES] RAY: His what? [PHONE RINGS] JULIANNE: Fugitive Task Force. - Never mind. JULIANNE: Charlie, it's Director Knox. Yo, Damani. What's up, brother? Yeah, you know, scheming and dreaming. Listen, do you still have access to those uniforms? I need a favor. We're working this case from every angle... ...but what we know is that Andre needed to get out today. Well, that indicates that he's after one hell of a score. Uh, yes. We're in agreement. Yes, I am aware that he has a history of armed robbery as well. [SIGHS] Yes, correct. We're on it, sir. Yes, sir. [SIGHS] All right, listen up. I just got my ass handed to me by Knox. I'm in there spinning a web of bullshit and we've come up with nothing... ...a plastic key, a conjugal. This guy's got a score lined up... ...and he's killed people before to pull these things off. So if we wanna catch Andre, then we gotta figure out what he's up to next. Now, what do you got? Ahem, okay, I'm still not getting the New Mexico of it all. Guy had a lot of waivers in prison. He had nail buffers, soft shoes, skin tonics. He's a four-star hotel kind of guy. Why an uncle's farm in New Mexico? Especially since his only uncle died eight months ago. Never even owned a farm. Here's the death certificate. - Andre was lying to her? RAY: Why, if she was just a piece of ass? She was lying to us. I knew that chick was bad news. Fellas. [DOOR CLOSES] Really good to see you, Andre. We weren't, uh, expecting you back so soon. Tell me you've figured out what we're doing about these marshals. [CELL PHONE RINGS] One moment. - My love. - What's going on? ANDRE: All will be made clear, I promise. Just be ready. For what? For us to be together forever. Andre, how? You're a fugitive now. Just be ready. I have to take care of a few things first. I'll call you back. I love you. Just please believe in me. Andre, here's the deal. There's too much heat from your breakout. If we're gonna do this job... ...you need to disappear and wait to hear from us. That's just the way it's gotta be. Well, I have two questions. - Number one, is everything on schedule? - It's under control. DENNIS: Holy shit. - Second question.... [GRUNTS] DENNIS: What the hell's wrong with you? Who's in charge? You are. That's what I thought. I knew it. Her bags are gone. She snowed us. CHARLIE [OVER PHONE]: Erica and I will keep an eye on the street. - See what you can get in there. - Copy that. Chick lived like a monk. There's nothing about this nightie that indicates monastic celibacy. - Give it to me. SHEA: Feels better with booty inside. LLOYD: Yeah, totally. Will you put that damn thing down? This is why we all need conjugal time, Ray. At a certain point, you can't think about anything else. - Can't you talk to Charlie? - You are unbelievable. You get a chance to get out early, and that's still not good enough? Okay, here we go. I haven't smoked a Cohiba since I ran my corner of Miami. These are not for blunts, homeslice. These are a gentleman's cigar. You're gonna tell me? When I was rolling, I used to hand these out like Chiclets. She seems like the kind of girl that smokes cigars. Pretentious. Or she's got an oral fixation. Oh, well, that's a perfectly pedestrian assessment, Shea. Like Freud stated so simply: "Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar." And this is not a cigar, this is a turd. - Those cigars were sent over this morning. - Well, they overpaid. Maybe it's not about the cigars. One of the traits of the Bad Elvises was coded communication... ...if I'm not mistaken. Sometimes a box is just a box, Ray. It's a drop box. Page out of the CIA manual. Hotel Deveaux. More of this, less of this. Now move your ass. SHEA: We're finally going to Manhattan, baby. Hey. Twerp with the French accent says he hasn't seen Andre or Kate... ...and neither registered for a room in their name. Time to break out español. How much money you got? How much am I willing to give you? - Same thing. - Forty bucks. All right, get Erica and lock down the lobby. [SPEAKING IN SPANISH] - Sorry, I don't speak Spanish. - All right, my bad. - I'm from Philly. - Got it, got it. Listen. Have you seen this guy around here? Oh, yeah, heh. You don't forget a man like that. Very handsome, very charismatic. I don't know how to describe it. You just can't take your eyes off him. So I hear. Where's he staying? Presidential suite. - You ready for a quick Spanish lesson? - Sure. [SPEAKS IN SPANISH] I need a big favor. [DOOR CLOSES] Balling. This is the kind of suite I used to stay in. - Oh, 1998 Domaine Ruisseau Des Pres. - Whatever that means. It means it's a $1500 bottle of champagne, Charles. More of a Cristal man, myself. Yeah, I've seen the Poof Daddy videos. You know, Erica, with her genital endowment ramblings... ...Andre just buys his women like so much merchandise. That's how he became such a prolific panty-dropper. Okay? Oniomania. Greek for oneomai, meaning "to buy." It's an impulse control disorder. A symptom of immediate gratification... ...wherein Andre gets high from vicious cycles of spending. And he spends because he's a walking id, and he steals because he can't not spend. He's incapable of laying low, which is good news for us. Uh, there is a dead man on the floor. - I bet Andre killed him. CHARLIE: No shit. Ray, I'm gonna need you and Erica to go check out a car. Ray. These are safecracking tools. Andre and his boys are planning a job, soon. This is great. We should just tie some tin cans onto the bumper... ...and bring more attention to ourselves. What do they know? Hmm? - That we're planning to do a job? - Ugh. It's a big city, Kate. We're fine. Anyone wanna bail, now's the time to do so... ...but your cut will be zero percent... ...which I'll assume would be my share had I not returned. PETE: I've been waiting my whole life for a score this big. [CELL PHONE RINGS] What's her name? You don't know her. Let me guess. She's young and pretty and naive, and believes everything you tell her. I'm sorry, Kate. I thought I'd said it enough times, but apparently I haven't. Now, get your damn head in the game. This is the last job. I'm done after this. Agreed. This isn't some smash-and-grab outfit. These guys are looking to take out some high-tech alarms. Yeah, okay. I'll wait for you to get here. Erica, come here. Stand in front of me, act like you're talking to me. Do it. - What do you want me to talk about? - Anything. Just do it. Shea mentioned how it wouldn't hurt if we got a little conjugal time. Mm-hm. ERICA: I think it would help clear everyone's head. I know it would mine. - Damn, you are mungry. - I'm mamished. - Take it up with Charlie. - I'd rather take it up with you. - I got him. - He made us. [ENGINE STARTS THEN TIRES SCREECH] Jules, put an alarm out on a black SUV... ...heading up Eighth Ave with limo tints. I only got half the plate. Son of a bitch. DOA was Douglas Acadia. No priors. Unmarried. - You cross-match him with Andre? - Yes, and Kate Lavin. No connections. Contact Major Case Squad at N.Y.P.D. Have them send over the MO files on the Bad Elvises. Uh, clerk said they would send it over as soon as they got approval. Call Bill Clark there, tell him that Ray said to send it over already. If Kate was a Bad Elvis, then maybe his other conjugals were? Find out. I wanna know everything about every woman... ...who went to go see him in prison. [PHONE RINGS] Fugitive Task Force. May I ask who's calling? Uh, hold on a second. - Charlie? - Yeah. Andre Brennan for you. - What does his voice sound like? - Crème de menthe. - Charlie DuChamp. - Andre Brennan. Good to meet you. - We'll meet in person soon. ANDRE: I'd love that. Especially if it was to work out a deal. - What are you offering? - My cohorts. I'll assume you'll know what I'm talking about. Minus a dead guy we found. - How many does that leave? - Three others. Not to sound too trite... ...but, uh, I'm ready for a change that doesn't, uh, involve incarceration... ...or being a fugitive. Okay. Where can we meet? No, no, no. See, I'd need the deal upfront. I walk for my testimony. Witness protection. I'm not with the DA's office. I catch fugitives. But once you're in our custody... ...I can introduce you to a very helpful-- I don't like hanging up on people abruptly... ...so I'm telling you right now that I'm hanging up. Some girls may find that act charming. I wanna knock this guy's teeth out. I need Andre's location, Jules. - Have they started the trace? - Yeah. What's taking so long? The call was terminated from your line. - Why can't they isolate it? - Not that easy. There are several outlets in the office, rerouted through headquarters. - What's the ETA? - Ahem, minutes. - How many? - Uh, five to 10. But that was five minutes ago, so five. Have one dead body, I'd prefer not to have another. I am completely with you on that. Who are you on the line with? If you're with a tech... ...then put me on the line with the ESU chief inspector himself. Charlie, can you please relax? I can do my job. Fine. That Andre guy, he's such a smug bastard. He's gonna call me at my office and run game on me? I'll see what song he's singing when I slap the bracelets on. Okay. Thank you very much. All right, he called from a pay phone at Mercer and Grand. Okay. Have Lloyd meet me at the car. This guy's real slick. Calls us from a pay phone? Doesn't expect us to trace it? Come on. Can we get, like, traffic photos or some kind of satellite imagery? Some kind of technology? Just stick to head-shrinking, Lloyd. Leave the electronic surveillance to the ESU. I'm just saying. Maybe he was picking up more cigars? He wouldn't call us from a traceable phone right outside of one of his hangouts. He's not that stupid. Trust me. Lloyd, when you, a known problem gambler... - ...were finally apprehended... - Yeah? ...where did we find you? - A casino. All right. - Exactly. CHARLIE: This is Andre's stash. The Bad Elvises communicate through cigar boxes. We're looking for the box with the skunk cigars. Get to it. Not this one. It's silky smooth. Ahem. Oh, my God, yes. You are full-bodied. And how about you? No, you are way too earthy to be a dud, aren't you? You got a bit of cedar, don't you, you little scamp? - Lloyd. - Okay. How about...? Okay, grandpa slippers, right there. "Friday at 9." We got three hours to figure this thing out. Do you recognize that? It's modern expressionism. The subject matter can range from celestial to bestial to excretional. Okay, I'm gonna close my eyes... - ...and count to five. - Hmm? Maybe that lovely cedar-smelling cigar fell on the ground... ...and you could find it and put it back in the box? One, two... ...three, four, five. - Wow, look at that. - Yeah, it's weird. CHARLIE: Let's go, convict. It's an alligator eating a bird. Looks like floating puke to me. CHARLIE: All right, Jules, thanks. Yeah, as soon as they can. Yup. She sent an image of the painting over to the Major Case Squad. They're trying to ID it. Could hit up the gallery party scene in the Meatpacking District. - Someone might recognize it. - Maybe Andre will be there... - ...so you can throw yourself at him. - Ha, ha. Withdrawn. Here's what we need to do, you guys. We need to just close our eyes like this... ...and imagine what the picture could be. Because Josef Albers, abstract painter... ...he said, "You only see truth through closed eyes." I think he was right. Does anybody else have their eyes closed right now? No. One more of Andre's girls we should be talking to. Heather Storrow. Says she visited Andre three times in prison... - ...but didn't stay for the conjugal. - Why would she concern us? All that schooling and the chairman of psychiatry doesn't know jack about women. Maybe all of these women are Bad Elvises, maybe none of them are... ...and maybe Andre and lovely little Heather were a couple on the outside. Okay, now I'm following you. The Madonna whore of it all. Wherein a man courts a woman with the qualities of his mother... ...hoping to fulfill unmet intimacy needs from childhood. But then soon, that woman is viewed as a mother, a Madonna figure... ...and thus, is not sexually attractive. Hey, Shell? I feel like we ordered that pizza 30 minutes ago. Thanks. So this guy reserves his sexuality for these dirty women, a.k.a. whores... ...and is thus in the quandary of not being able to love a woman... ...who satisfies him sexually... ...and not being able to sexually satisfy a woman who he loves. - Roughly. RAY: Been there. Okay, so then, boom, this Heather chick is his Madonna. More reason he would spare her the humiliation of the glove treatment... ...from a state employee. Look, she lives like two minutes away. It's worth a shot. Shea might be onto something. I'll call her in. - Bring me up a couple of slices. - Yeah, I'll come with. Seriously, interviews? Ten years' experience. You? Zero. What the hell, man. It was my idea. I'm just trying to help you out, bro. I mean, you want me in the game, right, Charlie? Go. - Heather, right? - Yes. Ray Zancanelli. You know what? Go ahead and start. I'll just, um.... I'll just listen in. This way. Oh, damn. I left the file downstairs. Be right back. [MOANING] Oh, baby, you're so bad. SHEA: Shea Daniels, baby. - Oh, yeah. CHARLIE: Do a search for famous shipwreck paintings. [KEYBOARD CLICKING] It's called Storm on the Sea by Mauro Iacobelli. It's a painting at the Geller Museum in midtown. Let's go. ANDRE: Thirty-five seconds. Mark. PETE: Light sensors. Clear. DENNIS: Heat detectors disabled. Check the vault keypad. PETE: Got it. I loved Andre before I knew he was... ...a criminal, I guess. When he got arrested, my world got turned upside down. RAY: So your visits to the prison...? Was to make sure I didn't love him anymore. He is not a bad man. I mean, not paying your taxes doesn't make you a monster. You're right. But what if I told you he was a suspect in a murder? - No. - I'm afraid so. KATE: Tapping into their system. You're all set. PETE: Bar secured. Decoupling the magnets. [DRILL WHIRRING] What's going on? I had to take the stairs. The damn thing got stuck. There's two things I don't like, Charlie, snakes and claustrophobic places. Hey, man, get that joint fixed, man, or you got nothing coming from me. CHARLIE: I got nothing--? - Bismarck jewelry collection. It arrived from Germany yesterday, and it's at the Geller Museum. Okay, I'll go get Ray. Get the others downstairs. Didn't even get a chance to get that file downstairs. [SCOFFS] Fly's open. [ZIPPER ZIPPING] I miss my girl, okay? I can't believe it. That's not the man I know. All I can say is, you're better off. This guy's bad news. I know. Well, now I do, anyway. It's a wrap. We figured out the thing. Well, thank you for coming in. You can let yourself out, but don't beat yourself up. You deserve better than that scumbag. [SIREN WAILING] [ALARM RINGING] - The Bismarck collection. - Put your guns away. It's only the primary alarm. We've already confirmed there's been no breach. - I'm telling you, the jewels. - I don't think so. Look. Security has been with it round the clock since it landed. CHARLIE: What the hell? Magnetic fields intact. We're good to go. [METALLIC CLANKING] ANDRE: We're in. We have a sophisticated alarm system. It's obviously working well. All it took was the primary alarm to scare them off. - What really happened? - It was preprogrammed. The alarm could have been set months ago. Let me get this straight. They set off the primary alarm system. And they don't rob the place. This thing was a diversion. Half the cops in Manhattan are distracted right now. I want information on every alarm that went off in the city tonight. JULIANNE [OVER PHONE]: Looking. Okay, Erickson Menswear in Little Tokyo. ABC Liquor on Bleecker Street. High-end places, Jules. Here we go. Schulman and Sons diamond wholesalers. It's on 47th Street. They got into everything. - How much did they get? - Between 9 and 10 million. That's just from the vault. For what I paid for that system... ...when it goes off, you should have been here in minutes. Whoever you expected, they were at the Geller. - I could care less about the Geller. - You said what you had to say, we get it. They targeted something else over here. What's, uh, missing from this case? GREER: A pearl necklace. Not worth much compared to the diamonds in there. These guys are so bad-ass, they got more than they can carry. Leaving behind diamonds. Hell of a score, man. Hell of a score. Glad you're impressed. Who is this guy? Shall I reiterate my walking id theory? Andre will not, in fact, be skipping town alone... ...he'll be taking a girl with him for whom he can buy things and impress. And in this case, one who likes pearls. - Oh, man. CHARLIE: What? RAY: Heather. He's a murderer and a thief... ...and he's gonna keep doing both because he's good at it. You know something, Heather. You're not the kind of person who's gonna let somebody like Andre get away. Are you? [SNIFFLES] He just called. Begging me to meet him and run away together. Meet him where? He's really a murderer? Crime scene photos are in the car, what do you wanna see? The bullet hole in the guy's chest, or the exit wound? No, no. CHARLIE: Where is he? He told me to meet him at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in a half hour... ...and wait for him there. [CRYING] There you go. - God. - Keep the pack. [SIRENS WAILING] ANDRE: They bought it. Great job. - Andre, this is craziness. - Not for much longer. Were you followed? No, I took a cab, and then the subway... ...and I walked around the block, like you said. Sweetheart, that's the last time I'm gonna ask you to lie. Andre, they said horrible things about you. Of course they did. Who are you gonna believe, me or them? - You. Ha, ha. - Of course you are. You ready? Oh, wow. Heh. Aw. For your faith in me, baby. - What now? - Buenos Aires. You're gonna love it. It's like Paris. We'll leave tomorrow. I just gotta buy us a little time. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Charlie DuChamp. How are you, Charlie? How do you think? I wanna take your offer. I'm done running. Good. Where are you? I have to take care of a couple things first. I'll meet you at the Viand Coffee Shop, 61st and Park... ...tomorrow morning, 9 a.m. This means a lot to me... ...so much so that I'm getting misty-eyed just thinking about it. Can you ask your girlfriend, Heather, if I could borrow a tissue from her purse? Tissues. Did they give you tissues? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? What's up, Andre? [TIRES SCREECH] [SIREN WAILS] You got two seconds to lower the window. I told you we'd meet again. Step out of the car for me. This is what we call a bird dog, a tracking device. Get out of the car. [OFFICER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO] RAY: Put your hands on the hood. [HEATHER CRYING] Take a seat. LLOYD: See, what did I tell you girls? You pull back the curtain a little bit, and the wizard... ...not so wizardly, right? Seriously, though, how do you do it with all the women? He is so much better-looking in his photos. Don't you think so, Jules? Yeah, oh, yeah, better in the photos. They'll be coming by to pick you up in a half hour, Andre. - They're not Cohibas. - Ooh. The champagne's only 10 bucks... ...but we know how to celebrate as much as the next guy. Bus terminal? Really, Andre, a guy like you? Not a guy like you. That's where you blew it. Self-persistent-- What do you call it, Lloyd? Oh, Persistent Ego-Aggrandizing Disorder. - Douchebag-itis, basically. - Heh. CHARLIE: Cheers. - Cheers. [CORK POPS] CHARLIE: Who's first? [SIGHS] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Yeah. JULIANNE: May I come in? - Sure. What's up? I don't appreciate the situation that I'm in because of you. I am putting my job on the line by not telling Charlie. - Well, did he ask if you saw anything? - No, no, no, that's not-- That's not the point. Look, I know that everyone here kind of knows about my personal issues. Maybe because of that, you think I'm some kind of pushover-- Look, look, look, it ain't even like that. Listen, I just needed some time with my girl. - I've been locked up for a long time. - So have I. After I washed out of the academy... ...I lived with my mom for three years... ...doing telemarketing. I never left the house. I thought that was gonna be the rest of my life... ...until Ray called me for this job. You wanna get out of prison? So do I. This is my chance to get my life back as much as it is yours. So do not mistake my illness for weakness. And don't put me in that position again... ...because if you do... ...I will tell Charlie. I don't care who you are. SHEA: I can't wait six years. Maybe next time you're on work release-- There's another way. But, baby, we'd be fugitives again. We'd be together. That's all that matters. This is for you.
