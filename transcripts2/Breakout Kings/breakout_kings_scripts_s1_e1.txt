 Breakout Kings (2011–2012): Season 1, Episode 1 - Pilot - full transcript 
 Hard-core robber and murderer August Tillman escapes from maximum security prison to recuperate the $500,000 loot from his last bank robbery, which requires finding and torturing his high-school cahoots. He becomes the test case for U.S. Marshals Charlie DuChamp and Ray Zancanelli's daring new program, recruiting escape artists from US prison nationwide to earn early release by helping them chase and capture escaped fiends.

 I got this. All right, hold up. On the gate! Let 'em go! Gate's clear! What the hell was that? So we get to Boscoe's mom's place, sweetest old lady. I'm there with this other Marshal, Katie Beal. Very fit young lady. Ray Zancanelli? Yeah. Deputy Charlie DuChamp. Be right with you.

 So anyway, I'm going on, telling this woman how her son could be looking at jail time. Katie stands to fetch her some tissues. I clock this old broad staring at Katie's ass like it's a Christmas ham. I grab this perv by her blue hair. The wig comes right off in my hand. It's Boscoe. His mother's been dead for ten years. The point is... sooner or later, I get hip to what's going on. I know you've been dealing drugs here, Jimmy. There's a school on the corner. If it happens again... It won't. Get outta here. What do you want? Tillman bashed the driver's head in with a tire iron, another employee, female, got knocked senseless. So... I've decided to revisit your proposal, Ray. I believe these were your candidates. Agent DuChamp's come over from Criminal Program Analysis. You'll be reporting to him. CPA? Seriously? Yes. Seriously. No one else wanted to work with you, Ray. Fine. I'll be in the field, Charlie here can send me reports and analysis, and if I ever run out of toilet paper on the road... This is your chance to put Tillman back in prison. If you don't like the arrangement... Yeah, no. It'd be great. Good. Gunderson! You're being transferred! See, all the shortcuts and ins and outs I perfected to make working here the most desired slot. Those tidbits are what they call "intellectual property," you with me? So if you job-up here, I need compensation. But three dollars a week? That's more than half what I make. Okay, now it's $3.50. Shea! I'm conducting business here. You're being transferred. Where are they sending you? I... I don't know. Perfume. The one I risked my job sneaking in for you. Right. I want you to keep that. Philly... Today, already. He's bluffing, go all in. Shut it, Lloyd. Lowery. You're shipping out. Shipping out as in transfer? Yep. Who's gonna be our cabana boy, then? Hey! Ciao, bitches. After 72 hours, the odds of finding an escaped convict drop to less than five percent. That's why I agreed to set up this task force. Because there's nothing more dangerous than a convict on the run. They have absolutely no... They know. They know. Look. You were four of the toughest runners I ever caught. And necessity being the mother of all evil... Invention. Whatever. We decided to use fugitives to help catch a fugitive. Except this time, you'll be in the field with me. Us. Right. Charlie here's from CPA. Criminal Process... What's it called again? Deal's simple. You agree to do this, you'll be permanently transferred to Maybelle Minimum Security Prison. Much nicer than your current accommodations. We catch Tillman, you get time shaved off your bids. Now you all know Ray, but you don't know me. In the Marine Corps, my nickname was Virgin: 'cause I don't (bleep) around. Any one of you tries to escape, you'll all get sent back to where we found you, sentences doubled. This offer expires in five seconds. Who's in? Sync and corrections by GeirDM for www.addic7ed.com. Tillman was six months into a 25-year bid for killing a biker in a bar who called his wife a bitch. He called his own wife a bitch, or he called Tillman's wife a bitch? Yeah, Tillman went around the country killing guys who insulted their own wives. That seems weird. It was Tillman's wife, you idiot. Oh, okay. Look, he bolted county lockup while awaiting trial. I caught him three weeks later, after he killed a deli cashier, and a woman he carjacked. Acute emotional deregulation, elevated rage distortion, no... So Tillman is dangerous. Okay, that's some insight. He's stretching his legs. Don't worry about it. Yeah. Where's Tillman's wife now? She got a restraining order the day after the murder. She divorced him when he was sentenced, and has since remarried. Yo, if this Tillman's a psycho, we gonna get strapped, right? Yeah. Why not? What do you want, Glocks or Berettas? Oh, no, I'd really prefer a non-lethal weapon, like a baton, or maybe a taser. No cons get weapons. You get cell phones when you're in the field. That's it. I don't need a gun. That's why the good Lord gave us these. Yeah, okay, but what are we going to do about clothes? We can't run around in these prison blues. I might have a hit. Like her. How come she's got new gear? Because she's a civilian. And she'll be treated with respect. Julianne Simms, meet the animals. What do you got? John Phelps. Tillman ran with him in high school. They got popped for a D&D; when they were 18. He was found at his home in Baltimore an hour ago... beaten to death. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Crime scene, fellas. U.S. Marshals. Don't tell me they're Marshals. They're Special Deputies. Let's go. Neighbor lady heard some yelling. She also noticed a black pickup truck parked out front. We'll catch the perp crossing into Mexico, though. What makes you think he's going to Mexico? The dead guy told us. Puerto Vallarta... a haven for fugitives. Why not write the assailant's name? Well, I'm going out on a limb here, but maybe he didn't know it. No, he knew it. They went to school together. Oh, who cares why he wrote it? We got the lead, we're following up. You're wasting your time. The target didn't write it because survival is the most primal instinct. Hmm, allow me to translate for our Cro-Magnon friend here. There is a direct correlation between mental acuity and physical strength. If Phelps was able to make it from there to that fridge and then process and write "P. Vallarta," it would indicate he had enough energy to crawl ten feet to that phone and call 911. Special Deputy Lloyd Lowery. How are you? So it's a shade. Tillman wrote it, hoping he'd throw us off. He's smart. Convicts, baby, nothing but time to plan it out. Well... we've got an alarm out on his plate number, regardless. This is a hustler's place... run-down warehouse on the outside, top-of-the-line toys on the inside. Are they still stretching their legs? 'Cause the con-woman says DOA is a hustler and has no idea what he's into, the professor can't find squat on the computer, and the mountain man... he's in the corner looking for a cat to gut. And look at your gangbanger... he's looting the joint. What you got there, Shea, CDs? Nail polish remover. Unless Phelps was a cross-dresser, he was using this for the acetone to take off the ink from the dye pack they put in the cash when you rob a bank. You're welcome. What the hell is that? Tasty goodness. That's evidence; put it back. All the times I got raided and cops stole from me... cash, jewelry, product. Please, I can have a couple of this dead fool's cookies. He earned a cookie. I said put the cookie back. Hold on, I'm gonna put you on speaker. Tillman used his debit card to buy gas in Shirley, New York six months before he was arrested for that bar fight. This was a year and a half ago, right around the time of an unsolved bank robbery in Shirley for $100,000. Three suspects... never caught. Three suspects in the robbery. We know two are high school buddies. We need a yearbook. You get all of that, Jules? Okay. These are pretty good cookies. We archive all of our yearbooks, Ms. Simms. We could mail you one. Oh, no, I need it immediately. Well, from Brooklyn, you can be here in 30 minutes if you take the tunnels. Ms. Simms? Oh, my Lord, there's been another shooting at the Hip-Hop Awards. It's strange that there always seems to be a firearms mishap at this particular awards ceremony, don't you think, Shea? I mean, Hip Hop Awards... shootings. Country Music Awards... no shootings. What's the variable? Keep it up, white shoes, and you'll see what the variable is. Here you go. Thank you. Soup and salad, Philly? Ah! Miss? I'm sorry. There's someone else's hair in my soup. I'll take it off the bill, ma'am. Thank you so much. How do you feel about dessert, Charlie? Save it for the 80-year-old millionaires in Boca, Philly. Okay. Jules, what's taking so long? I, um, had them scan the yearbook and e-mail it to me. The clock's ticking, Jules. Why didn't you go get it? The file's sent. Have Charlie check his in-box. The only activity listed is Auto Club. There, Auto Club. There's Tillman, Phelps. Is that our guy? James "Jimbo" Cantrall? Team delinquents to adult bank robbers. Gunderson, where's the knife? What knife? There are four of you here, two knives are on the table and one's in Lowery's glass 'cause he stirred his ice tea with it. That leaves one knife missing. So again I ask, where's the knife? You're a lefty. I'm guessing your left sock. It was for the team. In case any of us got in a scrape. Yeah. What are you doing? Take care, Gunderson. Ma'am. Nice team you put together. Zancanelli! You know me. Not anymore, Hoss. Where's the money, Jimbo? I don't know. I swear to God. I don't know. You do know. I don't. I don't. I don't. Shh... Okay, okay. What are you...? No! No! No! No! Can you leave the keys so we can listen to the radio? We're not gonna run, okay, Charlie? I know you won't. We're five blocks away from the casinos, Lloyd, and I sent everyone a photo of your ugly kisser. You wouldn't make it past the first slot machine. You see anything? TV's on. Really? You sure he's not friends with Pat Sajak? I'll call in for a warrant. - $600. - "R." Yes, three "R"s. Hey. What? Door was open when we got here. Back up. James Cantrall! U.S. Marshals! Yeah, you can pick up that gift tag. That's a Detour Deluxe bicycle with accessories from Raleigh valued at a thousand dollars. You got that, $1,550 in cash. Can I buy an "O"? Absolutely. Three "O"s. Oh, man. Slot machines? What kind of dollar-buffet rube does Ray take me for? Before he popped me, I would be comped in any suite in Vegas, five-grand-a-hand on blackjack, ten on a roll in craps, and I wouldn't even think twice about... Philomena Rotchliffer? Oh, my goodness. How creative did the kids get on the schoolyard? No, no, let me guess. Philomena Rottweiler? Fill-Me-Uppa Scotch-Snifter? Feel-My-Weiner Crotch-Sniffer. That's the one. Okay? You happy now, you little creep? I won't tell anybody if you let me see them. Hello? Yes. Yes. Well, I'm working. I don't know what time I'll be done. I gave you this number for emergencies only, Mother. Are you drinking? I heard ice cubes tinkling. And we talked about this... Got the FBI file on the bank robbery. $500,000 was taken. They told the media it was just $100,000. Thanks, Jules. Does a first-time bank robber and his high school pals pull off a perfect, one-time heist for half a mil without some inside help? Nope. What the hell is he doing? Look, his cell phone is in his back pocket. I need to check his call history. Can't wait for the M.E. I didn't tell you to stop. He's listening. Hey, Tillman, you remember me, you son of a bitch? I'm gonna get you! Not this time, Ray. This is Deputy Charlie DuChamp, U.S. Marshals. I give you my word that if you just co... What the hell are you doing? I'm getting in his head. I know this guy. Now he's scrambling. Did it ever occur to you that maybe we could just give this guy some misinformation instead of you acting like some cowboy nobody wants to work with? Get your ass in the car. Let's go look into this bank robbery. Deputy Charlie DuChamp, U.S. Marshals. We'd here to speak to Carmen Menjavar. About? The Shirley bank robbery. We're speaking to everybody involved. She was a teller there. Yeah, and she's already been questioned. Not by us. By all means. Hey, Carmen! The cops got more questions. So, uh, what do you need to know? Maybe I can help. Were you present for the robbery? No. Then you can't help. Deputy, huh? That's kinda High Noon. Who are you, the sheriff? Look, why don't you stop asking stupid questions and go get your girl? It's 'cause she's leaving! Hey, get off! Oh! Who are we rooting for? Shea! Go, go, go! Going too fast. Watch out for that thing. Oh-oh! Where you going now?! You're gonna kill her! Or she'll stop! Her choice! Oh! Hit the brakes! (tires screech I hate you cops! We ain't cops. I didn't rob any bank. Of course you didn't. That's why you NASCAR'd your way across Queens and your boyfriend Bigfoot's locked up in County right now, right? I ran because I'm not legal, okay? Visa expired about a year ago. I thought that's why you Feds were coming back. - I don't buy it. - Kiss my ass! It's the truth! No, no, no. The truth is when Tillman went to prison, you all screwed him out of his cut. Now he wants all of it. He killed Jimbo. He killed Phelps. Hey! If you don't help us find him, he's gonna find you. I already told you, I don't know who the hell Tillman is. Lowery. What are you calling him for? Ma'am. How's your afternoon going? What did you have for breakfast on the morning of the robbery? A bagel. Mm-hmm. And what did you see when the gun was produced? A gun pointed at me. Behind the gun? A man. Behind him? I was looking at the gun. Scary stuff, huh? Yeah. So that morning, after you woke up, you got dressed, you ate your cereal, you brushed your teeth, you left for work, you never thought anything like this would happen, did you? No. And I had a bagel. My mistake. What was the first thing to go through your mind when you saw the... Who farted? What? I'm sorry. Charlie, was that you? Because somebody cut the flounder and it's coming from your general direction. No. I did not cut no flounder. Just do your job. All right? Well, it's hard for me to do my job in what's basically now a hostile work environment. Th crack the damn door. Let's just get this over with because I didn't help rob any bank! Come on! Hey. Enough. Okay. You think this is a game? Huh? You having fun? I'm sending you back to the joint! Explain yourself, Lowery. A guilty person loves when the attention shifts away from them to someone else. If she was involved in this crime, she'd be happy to sit there all day, talking about who dealt it, but she wanted to get back to convincing you that she's not a criminal. So... so much for your inside man theory. Actually... we just have the wrong bank employee. Check this out. Kyle Ferro, the teller whcame to Carmen's aid. He quit the bank a week after the robbery, saying he was too scared to work there. But it seems he was too scared to even stay in New York. Tell them what you found. He sold his home and didn't buy a new one, nothing in his name. He just vanished. He's our inside man. Then we got to find this guy before Tillman does. Jimbo gave up Kyle's address, but U.S. Marshals are starting to put it together. You just get your ass to Richmond. Press pound twice to detonate. The minimal interaction. No eye contact. Cluttered workspace to make you feel cocooned and safe. How long have you had social anxiety and panic disorder with, I'm guessing, just a twist of depression? Let me guess. Family history. Uh... you were diagnosed 18, 19, and it really reared its ugly head about five years ago. Don't deny it. I can tell by your body language that you can't wait for me to get out of here. Yeah, that's because you've been staring down my blouse this whole time. That's true, but that's because I suffer from matriarch dependency with tangential memory fixation. So... See? I know what's wrong with me. Did you get all you need? 'Cause if so, you can leave now. Group therapy and shrink visits are hogwash. It's in their financial interest to keep you afflicted, so just walk one block outside of your safe zone, sit on a park bench and ask a stranger for the time. Next week, ask two people. You should stop waiting for a wrecking ball to knock this thing down. A crack in the dike will do. What are you doing, Lowery? I was giving a little advice, pro bono. You know, for a guy who was a child prodigy, you're not too bright sometimes. Don't talk to her. You are very protective. Do you want to talk about it? No. Leave. You okay? Fine. Kyle Ferro couldn't have just disappeared. Three clubs in high school, trainer for the football team. That's probably how they lured him into the heist. The desire to be part of something. Dependent personality disorder. Very common in Latinos, FYI. Does that sound about right, Charlie? You got some Puerto Rican in the mix? Cuban. - I was way off. I'm sorry. - Kyle tried to bury his name under an LLC, but he cosigned the papers for a bar in Richmond, Virginia. The other owner... his brother Frank Ferro. Bar was opened six months after the heist. A perfect place to launder money. We can be in Richmond in an hour. Hold on a second. That's not your call to make. I need a little more information if I'm going to drag everybody 350 miles. Everywhere the money's been, bodies are piled up. Sitting around waiting for tips, doing more analysis... this team was put together to avoid that. Use them. I could try Kyle on his cell. And you could talk to him. No. Let's wait for him to come home. Handle this in-house. Thanks for the milk. Let me tell you about a study I did when I was teaching at the university. I gave five-year-olds a choice between a nickel today and a dime tomorrow, and they all took the nickel. And my point is, that children have a hard time delaying gratification. And if we're being intellectually honest, so do your people. What's that now? Come on, brother. Just got my government check. Now I'm going to get some new bling and a brand-new set of rims. You're a straight-up racist. No, I'm a fact-ist. And the fact is that I can see in your eyes that you're thinking about jumping on that truck and making a run for it. Don't take the nickel, dummy. Let's just ride this out. We'll get some time knocked off our sentences and we'll finish our bids in a much easier environment. I'm just enjoying the view, bro. Hey! I want the dime. I got 25 years, and it's a hell of lot different inside a max shack for a guy like me than it is for you. - I'm not going back. - Neither am I. You weren't even part of this conversation. What are you saying? All I'm saying is if one of you is going to run, you'd better let me know so I can do the same. Nobody's going anywhere. Hold it. I want to know what the hell you did to get 25 years. That is none of your business. And there goes your ride. Yeah, well, the kids thought the nickel was worth more 'cause it's bigger than a dime. Your study was garbage. All right, chill. Here comes Zancanelli. Is Ferro there? Yeah, this is Ferro. Hey, Kyle. No, this is Frank. Kyle's not here. You want to leave a message? Nah, that's all right. What's up? No bead on Kyle. I thought you said if we follow the money, right? Settle down. His brother Frank's at the bar. So? He's laundering money for his brother. You think Frank's gonna talk to us? Take me shopping. I'll make him talk. Mmm, that tastes like melted jelly beans. We should probably be showing some affection if we want to effectively convey that we're a couple. So... You can put your hand on my thigh for five seconds. Okay. Any further north, you'll be pulling back a stump. Okay. Unpleasant childhood. Maybe some... some daddy issues. Other than that, I can't figure you out, Philly. You never will. Another? Mm-hmm. You know your husband's staring at us. I know. He likes to watch. Last call. You really think Philly's game's gonna work? Some dude's gonna watch his old lady get tagged by another dude? I mean, that actually goes down? Apparently. I said it before and I say it again... white people are crazy. All right, check this one out. Every crew needs a name, right? Breakout Kings? Doesn't make any sense. We're not breaking out. No, Breakout Apprehension Kings, maybe? See, this is why I was clearing seven figures while you fools was clipping coupons. I got vision. Doesn't make any sense. I don't like it. Breakout Kings. Upstairs. Let's wait. Yeah. Oh. Wow, this place is great. So is the owner coming by, or do we have all night? Sweetheart, I am the owner. Get out. This place is yours? Yeah. Me and my brother. Well, where's he at? 'Cause I like to party, but not like that. Don't worry your pretty little legs about him. He only comes by once a week, and tonight ain't his night. It sure as hell looks like it's gonna be mine. Once a week? Gosh, how far is his commute that he pulls off a sweet deal like that? Honey, I can get a pair of blues back at home. Now I saw what you did with that ice cube. Let's see if it translates. Where are my manners. ♪ 'Cause now you've got to fly ♪ ♪ Right to the angels ♪ ♪ Heavens await your heart ♪ ♪ And flowers bloom in your name ♪ ♪ Whoa, whoa... ♪ I am locked and loaded. ♪ Fly right to the angels ♪ ♪ All the stars at night ♪ ♪ Shine in your name. ♪ Morty's snake charmer pills should be working by now. I'll let him know we're ready. That is one lucky piece of electronics. What are you doing? I can't find Kyle Ferro's number in here. Are we gonna do this or what? Yeah. Be right up, handsome. Who the hell are you? Hey, man! Don't be stupid, or I will jam that down your throat. Start talking. - I said start talking. - I work for the government. You're a Fed like I'm a ballerina. No, look, I'm a con. They hired me. Okay, the con part I believe. Keep talking, or you both leave here in zip-ups. U.S. Marshals are after a guy named Tillman. They wanted to see if you two had been in touch. I don't know the guy. Feds think your brother Kyle does. And I've got some info that involves him. I spill it, you let me go. You want to blow this for us? You want to get killed? Katrina. Kyle. Hey, text from Lloyd. Seven? That's craps. They're in trouble. Stay here. I don't know how legitimate it is, bro, but just keep your head in a swivel and call me ASAP. On your knees! Back off! Or I will snap her neck! I said get on your knees and put your hands behind your head. Let her go or I'll split the freakin' unibrow in five seconds. Ray, I got this. Three seconds! Ray, stand down! You're making this worse! Time's up, Frank. Cuff him, Lowery. Put him on his knees. I told you not to fire. He was choking the girl out. Besides, I didn't hurt him. You hurt, Frank? I gave you a clear directive. And I handled the situation. This isn't CPA. Sometimes you have to fire your weapon you desk jockey. Look, I don't know how you see things, but I'm about to clear your vision for you. I head up this task... Look at me. I head up this task force. I waited six years for this opportunity and I'm not going to let you screw it up for me. The next time I tell you to stand the hell down, you... Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm fine. Take it easy. I'm fine! I'm sorry. Just take it easy. When I tell you to stand the hell down, you stand down. When you guys are done with the junk-measuring contest... by the way, my money's on Charlie... if you hit redial on the cell, that'll be Kyle's number. You can get an address off it. Okay, Charlie? Are you okay? He took my daughter! Did you see what car they were driving? I-I don't know. They got picked up ten minutes ago. Go ahead. Hello? How you doing, Zancanelli? Back off, or I'll make her kid suffer. Listen, there's no need to. You hear me? I'll make her suffer. And that'll be on you. Any other distinctive physical characteristics? No. Did Kyle get any recent tattoos? No. Um, ma'am, if it's any consolation, there's absolutely nothing in Tillman's pathology to suggest he'd do anything sexual with your daughter. He's strictly a killer. Miss... uh, m... miss, hair length? Unbelievable. Ask her if he wore boxers or briefs. Medium length. Just enough to cover the scar above his ear, from when they hit him in the bank robbery. Kyle has a little... gray in his beard when he grows it. Hold on. Kyle's hospital intake photo. It looks serious, but it isn't. And it's the exact same injury suffered by Amy Flynn, the food service employee. Tillman attacked when he escaped. They were working together. He just had to give her a love tap to make it look like she wasn't in on it. Criminal Program Analysis, Ray. Suck it. I'm sorry, ma'am. Julianne, you got anything? Amy Flynn quit her job, citing stress from the attack. Same excuse Kyle used. Another misdirect. They use a pretty girl to distract the guards, and he slides into the truck. Julianne, do a search on Amy Flynn, any cars she might have. Two weeks ago she bought a 1996 silver sedan. Most popular make and model in the U.S. Also, ATM hits the past few months... all around Quebec. You ran product to Canada. Damn straight. North Troy, Vermont, sleepy-ass border check. Weigh station deals mostly with trucks. Cars barely get a second glance. That's a reach. This guy did time, upstate New York. I guarantee you he asked around the yard about the best way to cross undetected, and this is it. Fine. I'll call border patrol. Hey, hold on, if Tillman sees a blockade, he will kill that girl without even thinking twice. We could get a plane from the Richmond field office. Let's get in front of him. Lloyd, is that them? Tillman's in the backseat; The girl's next to him. Shea, do your thing. Everything will be all right, Alyssa. Oh, yeah, listen to Kyle. If you can't trust him, who can you trust? One of the reasons... You know what? You know what? I don't even know why we're going! You know what? Then don't go! That way I won't have to hear you piss and moan about it the whole time! Fine, you jerk! You can just hitchhike, all right?! Just hitchhike! Go ahead! Go ahead! Whoa! Hey, you know what? Hey, you know, that's beautiful, pumpkin! No, no, no. Are you happy now? No! Why would I be happy? Look what you made me do! Dang. Man, miss, I'm so sorry, miss. Just tell him no problem. Let's go. It's no problem. Come on, get him out of the car. At least let me give you some money for this. No! No! Do you understand English? Oh, fine... narrow-assed bitch. Smart, Shea. What did you say to her? Baby, no, just let it go. August! I warned you, Ray. Now someone's gonna get hurt. You are, if you don't lower your weapon. Shea, get them out of the car. If he moves, I'll... You'll what, huh? Split my unibrow? You still using that one? Sometimes! No, no. You're gonna be all right. Don't touch her! Whoa! Bomb! I'm leaving now. If you follow me, I'll just pull over, run ten feet from the car and blow this kid to hell. I can't let you get in there, Tillman. Ray, stand down! Zancanelli, that's an order! Did you hear me? Doesn't seem like you have much of a choice. Oh-oh, Zanc the tank, huh? The crazy man? Come on. I'm not gonna say it again. Stand down and back away from the car. Stand down and back away! Now! I think your boss wants you to do something. If you hurt that girl, Tillman, I swear to God... You take care, Ray. Cell phone! Come on, babe. Excuse me. Do you have the time? Yeah. Five past 7:00. Thank you. You're welcome. It's not as crowded, there's no gangs, I can call you more often, and, I mean, it's still a prison, but it's-it's better. And, uh, get this, they want to make it a permanent arrangement, so... when they need us we help, and every... every fugitive we catch is a month off our sentence. And I, uh... I have to tell you, Mom... I actually helped someone other than myself today. You could've been so much more, Lloyd, so much more. So, what version did you hear? I know there are a couple floating around out there. I heard you stole some money. Your daughter turns 16 once, and when her stepdad tells her he'll get her a car because I can't afford it... Do you know how many times I've seen cops five-fingering their way through a perp's spot? But I never stuck my hand in the cookie jar. Never. Then a bust goes down, over a million in cash. I take exactly $8,250, not a penny more than what that car cost. Now I'm a scumbag con like the rest of them. Well, at least you're in a halfway house. You could be stuck in Maybelle. Or chained to a desk, like you were. I guess everybody's running from something, right? I guess so. Hey, Ray? No cons get weapons. See you soon, Charlie. Take care, Ray. Yeah, baby? I'm coming home.
