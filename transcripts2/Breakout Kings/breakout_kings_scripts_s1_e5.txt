 Hell yes. Don't go anywhere. I wouldn't dream of it. I could barely sleep last night. I like the sound of that. Boy, was I looking forward to coming to work today. Almost ready... I think I'm gonna need a ruler. Hmm. Where the hell did you get that from? Another friend. That's my son. Yeah. And if you want to see him outside of a pine box, I need to be in town in a half hour.

 Try me, Eddie. Even if I wanted to, how in the hell... Well, I've already thought of that. There's a scared straight program over at the visiting block. It ends in ten minutes. Let's go. Move your ass. Eventually you're going to get caught, Lilah. I am going to have a drink in my hand and my toes in the sand, that's what's going to happen. Don't worry, I'll send you a postcard. Now, go keep those other guards busy, or your kid's toast. Excuse me, and you are...? Get me into town. Any problems, and I'll stick you like a pig. Smile. Okay? Everything's gonna be fine. She's with me. Fire it up, let's go. Sync by GeirDM for www.addic7ed.com The women had their right breasts cut off. It's from Greek mythology. Am-a-zos, "without breast." They had it removed to better facilitate shooting a bow and arrow. That is how the female warriors got their name, not because they lived in the Amazon jungle. You child. Call. Three queens. What a dick. Lloyd. Yes. Let's go. Our work release van is leaving. Just pop it into neutral, there, slick. Daddy needs to fill his pockets. Full house. Threes and twos. Jinx. You are a jinx, man! Van's leaving. Come on. All right, gentlemen. You heard the man. I will see you around the gaming tables. I have to go. Hey. I want my money. Amen to that, brother. And I will absolutely pay you. You been serving that horseradish for two weeks now. I want it tonight, in my prison account. Or I'm going to kill you. Whoa. Whoa, man, that... Sounds an awful lot like a maximum security threat, and last I checked, we were in a decidedly minimum security establishment. I will drive myself back to a Max house before I let a mouthy-ass white boy disrespect me. How the hell did you get into maybelle, man? I found Jesus. Oh. Oh! Well, was it not Luke who said, "but love thy enemy, be good to him, and lend him without expecting..." Luke don't owe me 800 bucks. Dead. Lilah tompkins was five years into a 25-year mandatory minimum for killing her second husband. She stabbed him 48 times. First husband got killed in a house fire which she was a suspect in, but never convicted of. This woman is extremely dangerous. Jules, pull up her visitation log. Already put in a request. Our only lifeline's her 14-year-old son, who's currently in foster care in new Jersey. The FBI's at the family's house just in case Lilah tries to reach out to him. Says here Lilah was, uh, raised in foster care herself from age 12 on. How'd she get out of bixell? Threatened a guard's son. Turned out to be a bluff... she never even had the kid. Guard's on his way in. Lloyd. Pay attention? I am. Okay. How old's the runner's daughter? She is three. It's a son, and he's 14. Pay attention! Noted. My old cellie finished her time at bixell. She's out now, but, uh, she'd give me whatever scoop she's got on this Lilah chick. Would you call her for us, please? Eddie Vaughn? Yeah. Lilah's property. Could you step over here, please? Ray? Yeah. It's Teresa. Tell her I'll call her back. Who's Teresa? Don't worry about it. Okay, listen up. This convicted killer has four hours on us. Can we step it up? Hey, you-you, uh, saw that card game, right? There were some world-class cheaters at that table, man. What do you want? I got zoomed. Okay, I got taken. The born-again thug, who is apparently a complete fraud, he said that if I don't pay him $800, he's going to cap my ass. Mm... mm... So I was... I was wondering if maybe you could, like... Jack him up, or... You know, I don't know, like... Get him to recognize... Okay. This is what I'm going to do for you. Okay. Zero. You're on your own. Thanks. You weren't banging Lilah. Nope. I'm telling you, I brought that outfit in because she threatened my family. I don't know, Eddie, it's just... "Sexy teacher outfit" - seems like an odd request. - Yeah. The answer is no, okay? Look, I'm a married man. I take my job serious, so how 'bout you stop asking me that question? All right, relax. So, uh... Any nicknames that the female inmates at bixell called you? None that I know of. "Ponytail holder"? Doesn't ring a bell? Guards get called names, that's all part of the job. Right. All right, well, we're not investigating possible sexual misconduct between guards and inmates at bixell penitentiary. Yet. So why don't you get straight with us about Lilah, and if you do, guess what? You never have to talk to us again, dummy. My wife has been going through some health things. We haven't been intimate... Look. The teacher's outfit. You brought that in voluntarily, true or false? Yeah, but I sure as hell didn't know she was going to use it to escape. Did you give her the cell phone? No, another "friend" gave it to her, that's what she said. And how did she get a photo of your son? I swear to God I don't know. Who else was in her life? I don't... Maybe this one guy... I... There were a lot of lawyers visiting her, trying to get her conviction overturned, or that's who Lilah said they were. Then, one day, I seen her kiss this guy on the mouth. So I look into him. Name is Lucas Harold. Some loser who manages a go-cart track out in hempstead. Any pillow talk about what she'd want to do if she ever got out? No. She never mentioned going to see her kid? No, she never talked about it. When I walked her out, she said that she was going to be on a beach real soon, drinking a cocktail. And that she'd send me a postcard. Lilah subscribed to two travel magazines, and had a travel guide to the Caribbean. Let's go, let's go. Okay, port authority, train stations, airports, cruise ships, make sure you send her mug shot to ever single one of them. Also send it out to every U.S. embassy in every country that has a beach on it. And, uh... Go through the travel mags. See if there are any pages that have been dog-eared, torn out... just go through all of 'em. Hey, those kids up there on the track. There's something off with their body language. Two teen males? Yeah, yeah. They're hiding something. I should probably go poke around a skosh, huh? Yeah. Erica, go with him. Lucas Harold? Yeah. Us marshals. When's the last time you heard from Lilah tompkins? Why? Something happen to Lilah? I-I mean you wouldn't be here unless... She escaped from bixell six hours ago. Holy crow. Well, is she okay? Relax, we're looking for her now. Holy crow. How do you know her? Well... We met through this prison pen pal program. We're in love. In love?! My bad. What is up, young bloods? Hey. About to take a couple lap-arooskis around the old track? Yeah. You want to put a little wager on it, man? How much? 800 bucks. Dude, what? 700 bucks. What? Are you trying to screw this up? I owe money back at maybelle, and if I don't come up with it I'm dead. And this is your problem, too, because remember, if any one of us screws up, we all go back, sentences doubled. No, I'm pretty sure it's if one of us tries to escape, we all get sent back. There's nothing about getting killed over prison debts. Mother. Where have you been? Did you buy her a car? No. A house? No. Vacation spot? No. Look, I-I manage a go-cart track, sir. It's not like I have, you know, vacation property. You give money to one of her relatives? No. Did you share a bank account? Yes or no? Yes. Can you access that bank account from here? Of course. Really, I think it makes perfect sense. You have money. You're aged. You don't need it. I don't have money. I'm young. I freakin' need it, mom. Why don't you sell your comic book collection? Oh, you're obviously soused now. I'm not. Really? Then prove it. Count backwards from a hundred. Take responsibility in life, Lloyd. Just do it. Mm... Ouch! Eight grand! I really thought she loved me. Okay, julianne, thanks. Can you text me the address? So Lilah drained this guy's bank account from a branch at a mall up in valley stream about 20 minutes from here. Anything with the kids out there? Goose egg. All right, let's go. Thank you. Marry me. Baby! Oh, you just made me the happiest girl in the world. That's so sweet. We've got to call my mom. She's gonna be so happy and surprised. She never thought it was gonna happen. She's gonna be so happy for us. Thank you. Congratulations! May I help you? Yeah. This woman withdrew some money from the bank at the other end of the mall. Have you seen her? No, I haven't, sorry. How much if I run a game of eight-ball on that table? How much money? No, jockstraps. Yes, how much money? I'll do it twice. I will do it twice in a row. Sir, this is a store. There's no gambling allowed in the store. Whatever man. May I help you? Hey, how you doing? Um... Did you see this woman here today? I mean, did this woman happen to come... Sir? Sir? Hmm? She was here. We should give a heads up to local motels 'cause, judging from the gear she bought, they're about to get to it. Anything on the guy she was with? Oh, heavyset. Other than that, she didn't really notice him. You guys, I'm now convinced that Lilah has narcissistic personality disorder, subtype manipulative narcissist. Grandiose, expects deference from others, usually rooted in their defense as a child against a cold and unsympathetic parent. It's textbook. Okay, somebody say it, please. You just described yourself, Lloyd. Thank you. You're welcome. You guys done playing grab ass, or do you want to get your heads in the game? Thanks. Charlie, it's tough for me to pin down what her actual plan is. It could be a quick tryst at a motel, 'cause I doubt she'd be settling down with another dupe unless that dupe is the guy that's gonna get her to the beach for that cocktail. Time of purchase on the receipt said 45 minutes ago. She could be anywhere by now. You know, maybe they hung around a bit after they bought that stuff. I tell you what, I'll just go back and ask. Maybe not, shea. Lilah and the guy she was with shopped at a couple stores down. They bought 250 bucks in merchandise. All clothing for a teen male. For her son. U.S. marshals. Must be happy hour. What are you doing here, dingus? We own this fugitive. Not if she crosses state lines to see her kid. In which case, we'll take the collar. The question is, what the hell are you doing here, ray? Working. What do you think I'm doing, genius? Right. It's the "use a fugitive to catch a fugitive" deal. I thought that was a bad rumor. We're here to talk to her son Taylor. Lilah was recently buying clothes for a teenage boy. Yeah, well... Ah-ah. The kid has not been in contact with Lilah, if that's what you're here for. You could have called and found out. No offense, but we're gonna ask ourselves. And you might want to lower that hand or I can lower it for you. Foster parents' names are Derek and kitty. Thank you. Wow. What a crew. That's a whole lot of bluster there, buddy. You sure you're not overcompensating for something? You want to find out? Mm, mm, mm. How often do you see your mom, Taylor? Once a year, on her birthday. Phone calls? Once a year, on my birthday. We've told Lilah she's welcome to call as much as she wants, but... Have either of you been in contact with her recently? No. But we recently moved to terminate Lilah's parental rights and officially adopt Taylor. You're thinking that could've been the trigger to make her want to escape? It's hard to say. Are you daft? Of course it's the trigger. It's all about winning and losing with this woman. And I guarantee you... we get it, really. Taylor, your mom might try to contact you. If she does, I'll let you know. Just as long as you don't hurt her. We promise. We'll try our best. Folks, if it's okay, I'd like to talk to Taylor in private. Sorry. There's a phenomenon known as the attachment theory, which is basically what it sounds like. In fact, I can't believe the guy got published coining a term that self-evident. But the point is that children can forgive and look past a lot when it comes to their parent. Even if that parent is a very, very imbalanced mother. How old are you? Fourteen. Okay, when I was your age, my mother used to duct tape oven mitts to my hands at night to keep me from masturbating. Which was such a violation, and it didn't work, by the way, and I started to harbor a lot of resentment, yet here I am still making excuses for her. Why are you telling me this? Because I don't believe you when you say you'll notify us if your mom contacts you. Hey, I empathize. But Taylor, you have to know there's a price you pay for covering for an unfit mom: It's your own self-worth. You seem like a well-adjusted young man with good moral development. Don't let your mom wring that out of you 'cause of her mistakes, okay? Here's my cell number, if you want to talk. The original sandman. Nice. I've been there, okay? Oh, my God, it's so good to finally see you, Jeff. Mm... Dreams really do come true. I got a call from someone with the U.S. marshals. They want me to come in to talk. Well, we expected that, right? Just tell them you visited me in prison and that's it. Do you have everything, baby? I just, I just don't understand why you need all this when you could just stay with me. Well, I am going to stay with you, baby, for the rest of my life. First, I need to take care of a few things. I'm gonna need the car back tomorrow. Well, I'm gonna need it longer than that. I really need it back tomorrow, sweetheart. Do you want me to get caught, Jeff? It's just... Do you?! Of course not. Well, it sure as hell sounds like it. When I do, maybe I'll have to tell the cops that you provided these things to me. Do you want that? No. Well, quit trying to ruin everything. You'll see me when you see me. I'm just warning you that I will not lie to the police, so when they do talk to me... wrong answer. Please, no... no... Good afternoon. Afternoon? Uh, these were five of Lilah's repeat visitors in prison the last two months. Uh, I have calls in to four others, but no word back yet. Turns out Lilah was an active pen pal-er. Uh, another trait of the manipulative narcissist? They love getting things over on people. Did we get the mug shot out? We missing anything? Yes. Uh, yes, it-it is out. No word on missing anything. Milt Langley? Yeah. Follow us. What do we have here? A little rebel fetish, you guys, huh? Bunch of dream lovers using fantasy projection to wish away reality, huh? Grabbing on the only chance to control a relationship because the inmate needs you more than you need them? Sound about right, maybe? Leave 'em alone. Oh, they're fine. It's not just pen pal-ers. Same dynamic and attributes apply to all the millions of losers in chat rooms around the world. It's very common. She should never have been in prison to begin with. Her jerk of a husband was abusive, and Lilah was a battered woman who got out the only way she knew how. By stabbing him 48 times? Looks like she's good for the body we found in the park. Another one of the schmucks that loved her. Or how about her first husband, who she turned into a crispy critter one night? Come on, man. Wake up! When was the last time you saw her? Two weeks ago. She broke up with me. For no reason. She didn't try to contact you today? No. I really thought we were in love. So, we'll be in touch, Milton. Okay. All right. Help you? Gabe Prescott. I got a call to report here. That's right. This way, Gabe. Gabe? Let's go. Rebel fetish isn't the only fetish that draws men to female inmates. I think I need to listen to this interview. So, Gabe, how'd you know...? I'm not telling you anything. This guy don't want to talk. I guess he's free to go, right? Sit your ass down. Were you with her at the valley stream mall today? Perhaps I was. That's not a crime. Did you take a photo of that guard's kid and text it to her in prison? I took a photo of a kid. I didn't know what she wanted it for. And again, not a crime. Okay, look, Gabe, all we need is either Lilah's location, or the phone number to the cell she has on her. That's it. You give us that, and you can leave right now. Go back to your mother's basement where you can go play air guitar, or whatever else you play with. I don't know where she is, and you're never gonna find her. We want the cell phone number. I can't remember it. Okay, he's defending Lilah out of some version of Stockholm syndrome, which indicates that she threatened his life at some point. Wrong. Jules, I may need to borrow a few things. Listen, Gabe, do you really want to play prince Valiant right now? Aiding and abetting the escape of a convicted felon carries ten years mandatory. She told me that she was released on her own recognizance. I had no reason not to believe her. Naive? Maybe. But not a crime. You see those other guys out there staring at the floor, Gabe? They pen pal-ed with her, too. You got played. I have nothing else to say to you. Where is she? Take a walk. Excuse me? Go. I'll tell you the same thing... Did I give you permission to speak? No. Then apologize. Not going to ask you again. What?! I'm sorry. We both know that one of the foundations of a slave-mistress relationship is trust. And discretion. Lilah's prison jacket has her listed at five foot two, 115 pounds? There is no reason she would be buying extra large underwear at that lingerie store, is there? No. So, I am going to show discretion and earn your trust by not announcing to my coworkers and yours that you are currently wearing a pair of pink lace panties under your jeans. Do I get a thank you for that? Thank you. Thank you, what? Thank you... mistress. Get your hands out of your pockets, Lloyd. They're dirty. I detest dirty boots. Oh. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. First things first. Nice work... Mistress. That is Lilah's cell number. Thanks for the loaner. Oh, you can keep 'em. Keep 'em. A half hour. Half hour? How long does it take CPA to trace phone activity? Half hour? Okay, look, she's already got ten hours on us. We're losing time. Uh, what haven't we thought of? Think outside the box. We need a lead, Jules. We need a lead! We need a lead! Hey, Teresa. Aw, thank you, baby. Here now? Tell me you have something, ray. Um, actually, that was my daughter. She's downstairs. Everything okay? Yeah. Yeah, fine. I just don't get to see her as much as I'd like. You know, her mom is a bit of a pill when it comes to that. So, um... I guess I gotta ask if I could go down there for five minutes. Of course, ray. No sweat, man. Mother, I am sorry, okay? Just... There's a bunch of kisses for you. Just call me back, okay? Hey. Um, hey, how did you read that Prescott guy like that? And just don't be coy, just tell me. The pink undies peeking out of his pants was a good start. Oh, yeah. But I can usually tell what a guy's into, regardless. It's all in the eyes. Really? What, what what am I into then? Mm. Whatever you can get. You're desperate. Yeah, you're good. You're really good. So that guy in there... he's kind of like your-your "bee-yotch," right? I guess. Okay, so how about you get your classy chassis in there and you command him to give me 800 bucks? Your prison debt is not my problem. Erica, he is going to kill me. Oh, stop being so dramatic. What did he actually say? I am going to kill you. That ain't good. Hey. Tough man to get a hold of today. Ah, how you doing, angel? Good. Good to see you. You, too. Happy Birthday. Oh, thank you. Look at that. Is your office doing anything special for you today? Yeah, they're blowing up balloons as we speak. But it's going okay? Yeah, I'm actually working a case right now. That's why I can't stay too long. So you're on track to be a marshal again? Maybe. If the stars line up. How long do you think you'll be at the halfway house? Hopefully, not too much longer. Why can't I visit you there? Too many lowlifes. Well, why can't I at least see your office? Too many lowlifes. Hey, hey, listen. It's okay, really. I'm just trying to get it all back. But sometimes I don't feel like I... I deserve to get it back, with taking the money and all, you know? But you do deserve it, dad. No, all I know for sure is... I got you. And believe me when I tell you, that's all I give a damn about. Charlie? Call history came in on Lilah's phone. Anything? Uh, yeah. You're not gonna believe who she's been in contact with. Oh, man. Don't worry about that stuff. What do you want? Feedback came in on Lilah's cell phone. We're heading there now. How's it going? Hi, I'm Teresa, Ray's daughter. Got to go, ray. Yeah, hold up a sec. Thank you for the cake. Okay. So, I'll talk to you soon? Definitely. Come here. Don't ever do that. I don't want cons around my family. Hey, you left your cell phone on your desk, and Charlie told me to... Did you hear what I said? Did you hear what I said? Whatever, boss. Where's the kid? He's upstairs taking a nap. He's not feeling too well. What the hell's going on? He's been in communication with his mom. Great. Good job, stoltz. She got what she wanted. Now there's no move to anticipate. Our job just got ten times harder. We didn't have the kid under house arrest. We're just here to protect him. This is protecting him?! You better take it down a peg, zancanelli. I only take heat from a real marshal. Enough! When was the last time you saw him? Half hour ago. Let's go. Thank you, Jules. No signal on either phone. She must have pulled out the batteries. All right, what do we already know? Lilah used three guys to get to where she is now. If I had unlimited women on the outside, I wouldn't stop using them, especially now. She's got her son, she needs to build a nest somewhere. Why not get some sucker to pay for it? Is the kid in there, Lloyd? Just browsing. What you got, Jules? Lucas Harold, the go-kart guy... um, nothing from him. Gabe Prescott, the guy who licked my boots... uh, nothing, really, in terms of property. Hold on. Okay, the first guy you interviewed, milt Langley... he owns rental properties throughout Jersey. - Maybe him? - No, we talked to him. He says she broke it off with him. He seemed believable. Maybe we were wrong. Hey, baby. My son, Taylor. Taylor, say hi. Shake the man's hand. Hi. Hi. There you go. Say, did the police contact you? Uh, yeah, U.S. marshals did. And? Well, I told them I didn't know where you were. Beautiful. Now, baby, I need a huge favor. We need to stay in one of your houses for a few weeks. You know, some place real quiet. Lilah, you broke up with me. I know. I needed you to be convincing if the cops reached out. Baby, I love you. I would never want to be away from you. Didn't I, didn't I say to you that you you had to trust me? Didn't you swear to me that you would? Look, I'll make it up to you, okay? We'll do all those things we talked about. Lilah, I saw the other guys. The pen pals. Oh... Did the marshals tell you that? They were lying. No. You lied to me. Mom, let's just go. Shut up. Baby, I would never lie to you. I'm sorry. You're gonna have to leave. We've got nowhere else to go, milt. Hey, I'm asking you to leave. Okay? Just go. Or I'll call the cops. Mom? Please. Mom! You're gonna do what, milt? Mom, please. Just put the gun down. You're gonna do what? Please, mom, no! No! Anything? No, just a flier for the wnba. Are you joking? The wnba is still around? You can't be serious. They've been around for the last 12 years. You don't get the sports page in prison? Hey, guff it up. I love the Washington mystics. Yeah. You would. I do. Hey, guys. Yeah? Another trait of the manipulative narcissist is the inability to lose gracefully. Her fantasy's collapsed, so she's lost. She's coming unhinged. Looks like a small caliber pistol. Entry wound, no exit wound. This is empty. Is this the Professor guy? Taylor? My mom shot someone. She's got a gun and she's talking a lot of crazy stuff. I think her plan fell apart. Where are you now? Some trailer park the guy she shot owns. I don't know. I'm just worried about her and I don't know what to do because she won't listen to me. Uh, what is she saying? Stuff like it's over. Taylor? I need you. Don't leave me alone. - I got to go. - Taylor, listen to me. You need to get out of that house. Your mother might be suicidal and if you stay, you might get hurt, as well. Taylor! Taylor! Taylor, what are you doing? Taylor... Taylor! I can't just leave her. Taylor! Let's go. All right. Langley owns 85. All right, we got to be real careful about this, guys. The key is to get Lilah away from her son, so she doesn't have a chance to take him out, too. When I did bounty work with my dad, we did plenty of extractions in trailer parks. I mean, I've got some ideas. We can go in first and... Listen. If it comes down to a negotiation, do not let her see you lying. A person with her disorder can't stand being manipulated. Did you just say "bounty work"? Please just put the gun down. It's over. They're going to find his body. There's no other way out. There's always another way out. Lilah tompkins, this is the U.S. marshals. I don't want to be separated from you again. Do you want to be separated from me? No... Then I have a plan. Where we can both... 805 00:35othtogether forever. I have some good news. Milt Langley survived the shooting. He will not press charges. Talk about the guard thing. Eddie Vaughan admitted that he helped you escape. In exchange for your testimony against him, you will not face charges. What do they think? I'm some dumb skank? Mom, just turn yourself in. You're lying to me! Mom! Please! It's over. There's no other way out. You're lying to me. That is correct. Gun! Put the gun down, lady. Lilah, you don't have to do this. Put the gun down. Put the gun down. Don't be stupid. Put the gun down. Lilah, don't do this. Mom! Lilah, no! Put the gun down! Mom! Mom. She's gonna be alright Taylor. Next time, call for back-up. From you? We wanted to prevent the situation from going bad. Did you help yourself to anything inside, ray? What? I mean, you know, check under the mattress. You never know. Ray. Not now. You're having a lot of fun, knowing he can't hit you, right? But I can. In the van. I accept responsibility. Good. Good for you. What? I accept responsibility for my gambling problem. But will you do me one favor? When they find my body shanked in a cell, will you please tell my mom that I hate her? Will you do that for me? Sure. No. Don't tell her that. Don't say that to her. Tell her... tell her I'm disappointed. Yeah. Tell her that I'm disappointed in her choices. Okay? Hey. I'm, uh, I'm Erica Reed. I may have been a little rude to you the first time we met, and I apologize. - Okay. - Erica. You should take some charm lessons from her, Charlie. We need you, Lloyd. But if you ever get in debt again and jeopardize my gig here, I will harvest one of your organs with my thumbnail. This is worth, like, $400, Max. Oh, my God. It'll be enough. Yes, sir.  I'll do that. Thank you. Good night. Sir, that was knox. For once, the man's happy. Happy, ray? I'm happy. Package for ray... Zancarelli? Zancanelli. Over here. It's from my daughter. Open it. I'll wait for you in the car, man. Do you remember what you told me when I got kicked out of the academy? You said if I didn't give up, I could find my way back one day. How about we do it together, okay? Yeah. Just remember, he has a lot of tattoos and things, so be careful. Okay? It's all up here, baby. There. My boy's debt with you? It's off the books. Your boy, huh? Well, tell your boy this covers half of it. There's an inconvenience fee applied. That's all of it, Tyler. Watch. 124 Mercer street, brownsville, Brooklyn. Yeah... I got your card, bitch. You ever come around him again, you'll be winding th with your tonsils. And this will be the last time you look me in the eye around here. That's what I thought.
