 OFFICER [OVER PA]: All inmates going to Chivalry Castle, line up at the bus. All inmates going to Chivalry Castle, line up at the bus. Hey, who wants to tell me why we're going on this trip today? - Kenny. - Because we listen and... - ...we have good behavior. PAULA: That's right. And why aren't Todd and Phillip... ...going with us today? Kenny. Because they didn't listen and they had bad behavior. That's right. And field trips can be taken away. So follow the rules. Come on. VICTOR: Bennett, you can't take your stuffed animal with you.

 Please? It's all right, Victor, let him go. Go ahead. PAULA: Any misbehavior, you lose all privileges. And you don't wanna end up in the isolation room. Hi, good morning. Paula Berry. Thank you for opening up early for us. Not a problem at all. Glad to help. [CHIRPS] You like that? Grandpa. Grandpa what? Grandpa painted. PAULA: Grandpa painted birds.

 Is that a nice memory? Yes. [CROWD APPLAUDING] MAN: Ohh! Where's Bennett? Bennett? Bennett, you come here right now. You are in big trouble if you don't. All right, Bennett. [YELLS] RAY: Bennett Ballester, inmate at a hospital for the criminally insane up in the Hudson. Killed an orderly, escaped while on an outing... ...to some jousting joint called Chivalry Castle. - A day trip? - Integrating the mentally ill... ...with the outside world is an often successful practice... ...when you're working towards rehabilitation. In this case, clearly very unsuccessful. Jesus, damn near took the guy's head off. Bennett gained access to a secured room. Got the sword, did his thing to the orderly... ...took one of those goofy outfits the knights wear and walked out. CCTV system at the castle only tracks him leaving the facility. Orderly's wallet was missing. What the hell's he doing in there? He's killed before, this guy? Correct. Jules? Um, Bennett was in 10 years for killing a local newscaster he was obsessed with. She was engaged to be married. They never found her body, but her DNA was pulled from skin under his fingernails. Erotomania. Ahem. It's a common trait in stalkers. They, uh, believe the object of their affection... ...usually somebody famous, is in love with them... ...even though the victim, uh, in most cases, doesn't even know they exist. Continue. - Uh.... JULIANNE: Um.... Bennett should be in maximum security prison for life... ...but his lawyer proved that he was unfit to stand trial... ...due to a history of something called comorbidity. LLOYD: Are you okay, Charlie, or...? - Finish. Roger that. Uh.... Ahem, yeah, comorbidity basically means that Bennett is a whole cocktail of crazy. You know? Uh, think of him as trail mix, except you replace the nuts... ...and the pretzels and those delicious little yogurt droplets... ...with paranoid schizophrenia, auditory hallucinations... ...and, uh, delusional psychosis. There's a reference here to a diary that his lawyer had suppressed... - ...during the competency hearing. - I need to see that diary. RAY: Jules, look into that. - On it. Only family is his brother. We should talk to him. Dude, what? You know, I'm more pissed at myself... ...for actually thinking that I could trust a bunch of no-good convicts. But be that as it may, I just want my watch back. Okay. That watch belonged to my father. It was given to him by the Chief Justice for his service as a U.S. Marshal. Even if it was made out of bubble gum wrapper... ...somebody went into my desk and took something of mine. At the end of this tour, I want that watch back on my desk... ...or heads are gonna roll. It wasn't me, so.... What? No. - I didn't take shit. - Look, I don't care who took the watch. I just want it back. Go ahead, Ray. Lloyd, you and I are heading to the loony bin... - ...see what they have. - Okay. Jules, call in the brother for Charlie to interview. CHARLIE: Let's get to work. [SCREAMS] - I don't like these places. - Nobody does. Nobody does. I figure this would be a smorgasbord for your egghead. Absolutely it is. I find it undeniably fascinating. I did a three month rotation at a place like this once. I'll never forget it as long as I live. But I didn't like it. - You take Charlie's watch? - Hells no. - Look me in the eye, you gambling addict. - You belong in a place like this... ...if you think I'd jeopardize my chance to get out of prison early. Um, I'm Paula. You must be Ray? Ray. This is my colleague, Lloyd Lowery. - Thanks for taking the time. - Of course. Anything I could do to help. - I'm sorry, I-- - We understand. Victor worked here for seven years. - I just had to notify his wife. - Any help that you could give us... ...in trying to track down Bennett would be appreciated. Um.... Please. PAULA: Nothing like this ever happened. Ain't about that. We need to know about Bennett... ...to get to him quickly before he hurts somebody else. I just.... I don't know. He was an ideal patient. - He was on a good combination of meds-- LLOYD: Hmm. Based on his actions, that suggests... ...uh, he's been off the cocktail for a while, without your knowledge. - How do you know so much about this? - I have a PhD in Behavioral Psychology. Hmm. Heh. You're here to show me what a horrible job I'm doing, huh? No. - It's okay. I'm an easy target. - We need see his room... ...get a copy of your session notes, things of that nature. You know, I saw in, uh, Bennett's file he has a history of fixation. Chiefly, the newscaster that he stalked and killed 10 years ago. Is he fixating on anything now? If he's off his meds, might be where he's going. I just don't know. He had us completely fooled. Was he close with any other patients here? [LLOYD CLEARS THROAT] Teddy? I'm Lloyd. I have some questions about your buddy Bennett. [LLOYD CLEARS THROAT] Yeah, I want you to know that, uh, I have nothing... ...but the greatest admiration for your courage and conduct. I've heard nothing but really great things about you. Normally, I'd take my time and we could play word association games. Uh, I'd use positive reinforcement, and you'd talk to me... ...when you're comfortable, but I don't have time. So... ...I'm going to do something completely unethical, and bribe you with candy. What do you think about those? You like chocolate, don't you? No. I'm allergic to that. Okay. No problem, no problem. Let's go on over to pocket number two. And what do we have? Are those suckers? They sure are. - Sour apple? - Got one right here. Bennett. What's he really, really into lately? Anything? Anyone? - Meow time. - Meow time. The television? - A TV show? - Meow time! - Good, good. Great. - Meow time! - Meow time! Meow time! - Thank you. Jesus. [FIREBALL MINISTRY'S "END OF STORY" PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] A little winter camping? That's the spirit. There was a man who changed it all Find everything you're looking for? What? The 19-inch stainless bolo? That's a nice one. Good weight. You, uh, need a GPS? Got one special, 79.99, fully waterproof. Hey, uh, you want your change, pal? - Calvin Ballester? - Yes. CHARLIE: Any movement on getting Bennett's diary? I'm on hold with the lawyer's assistant. - Charlie DuChamp. - Hey. CHARLIE: This way, please. When I come back, you all better have a lead. This way. I bet you Lloyd took it. Yeah. Or you. All I know is I didn't take it. Yeah, okay. Says the gangbanger. First of all, I wasn't a gangbanger, shorty. Gangbangers worked for me. That's like calling Bill Gates a computer geek. Second of all, I don't think Lloyd's got the sack... ...to steal something like that. Which leaves you over there, batting your baby blues. I got a kid, Shea. What do you have to protect, your rep? - Watch your mouth. - Don't accuse me. Mr. Kincaid, your client is a fugitive of the law. Sir, getting a warrant could take days. We don't have that kind of time, and-- Mr. Kincaid? Oh, he is messing with the wrong chick. Shea? I may need a favor. I'd apologize for what he did today if I meant it. But I've been doing it for so long... ...I'm just embarrassed we share the same last name. I knew where he was, I'd tell you. Anybody in your family who might not feel the same? - Somebody who might harbor him? - Nope. - So why'd you come today, Calvin? - Because you called and asked me to. When your brother killed the newscaster... ...nobody in your family cooperated. It was on the advice of my family's attorney. - You didn't know anything. - Did Bennett confess to me... - ...and I suppressed it? No. - That's not what I'm asking. You didn't say one word 10 years ago... ...when you didn't mind sharing the same name. But yet today, you run over here from midtown. Do you know something that can help us? Look, six hours ago your brother basically decapitated somebody. - I don't have time to waste. Where is he? - Okay, I don't know. I mean, I swear to God. But, and I guess I should have told this to the cops back then... ...my brother Bennett... ...he lived up in the Adirondacks behind our house, growing up. I mean, he'd disappear for days, weeks. I mean, he'd come home with a backpack filled with dead birds. - Meow time. - I'm searching. Nothing yet. LLOYD: Something about television. - Yeah. You told me. Maybe cross-reference "meow time" with television. Really, Lloyd? There's no "meow time," or feline references... - ...not even the initials M.T. - Session notes are useless. Bennett was spitting out pills for who knows how long. Lunatic was running game on the facility. Get me a map of the southern Adirondacks, above Northville. His brother said Bennett's a known survivalist... ...right after he watched Rambo at the age of 13. He's obsessed with trails. Gonna show us where the family lived. Adirondacks are about the size of a small country. Which would make them the haystack, Bennett the needle. - You know who we need? Gunderson. - No way. Who's Gunderson? Gunderson, where's the knife? It was for the team, huh? In case any of us got in a scrape. Take care, Gunderson. One of the first Breakout Kings. Until Charlie caught him stealing, uh, an eating utensil. He's a survivalist who grew up in the Adirondacks. In other words, he's made for this case. Can't trust these cons with a watch. I'm gonna trust this guy... - ...who copped a knife on us? - "Meow time." "The signature greeting used by the host of Good Night Kitten." Hosted by Debbie Myers. Bennett's first victim, ten years ago. Erin Colfax. Um, I would feel way more comfortable... ...if we let Ms. Myers know what's going on here. Like, as soon as possible. [DOORBELL RINGING] Okay. Wow. Patience. I'm coming. Heh. Are those for me? Hello, kitten. Christ. [BOTH GRUNTING AND DEBBIE SCREAMING] No. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER DISPATCHER] You said her car's gone? OFFICER: Yeah. We put the word out on the car statewide. - Family's been notified? - Making the calls right now. All right. Anything? A very organized closet. She hung everything by season. There's a chunky hanger with a pair of ski pants... ...and a clear plastic shoe box with dirt inside. My bet is Bennett went upstairs and took the ski jacket and hiking boots. Heading to the Adirondacks. Erica? You have something to say? No. No, nothing. - Man. ERICA: What? CHARLIE: Wedding invitations. She's supposed to be getting married on Saturday. Thank you, Amber. SHEA: Damn. - Mr. Crawford? Phillip Kincaid. My assistant tells me you need some help with some criminal issues. Yeah. I heard you're one of the top criminal defense attorneys around. - I know a lot of guys who have used you. - Well, I'm glad to hear that. Just so you know, it's a $5000 retainer up front. - And you are? - Julianne Simms. We spoke on the phone. Okay. Cute. Look, my client's diary... ...as you are choosing to call it, has the words "dear counselor"... ...on the first page, and "sincerely, your client" written on the last page. Now, that makes it not evidence... ...but privileged attorney-client correspondence. So you two can now leave until you have a subpoena. I don't think so. - I'm sorry? - Julianne pulled up your court records. And I personally know 10 guys who've used you. Six worked for me, one's my second cousin. They all owe me. - And who the hell are you? - I'm a shot caller, slick. And I'm gonna pick three of their names out of a hat. And then I'm gonna have those three cut a deal saying... ...you recommended they perjure themselves for lighter sentences. The reason I'm picking three is because one guy saying it... ...is just some convict running his mouth. Two? Now, that gets suspicious. Three? You get your ticket punched, lose your license... ...get convicted for criminal conspiracy and end up in Sing Sing... ...where I'd make sure the right booty bandits in there run a train on your ass. Or... ...you can just give us the damn diary, Phillip. [DEBBIE WHIMPERING] You can come up front. Who are you? What do you want? No. Be careful. You'll crush it. [ENGINE STARTS] Is that my wedding dress? We've got something. - Gunderson? You gotta be kidding, Ray. - Bennett's hometown... ...the location of the house he grew up in what the brother said, all that. Gunderson helped us narrow down a location. LLOYD: It was quite impressive. RAY: High Peaks trailhead. But we're not equipped for this pursuit. We're talking boondocks in winter. He grew up in those mountains. - We need him. CHARLIE: We can do it. With recon overflights from Defense Mapping Agency... ...thermal imaging, K-9 units-- If we wanna find this chick's remains in two weeks. You know we don't have that time. If this whack job is a true survivalist... ...he'll take the abandoned trails which are dense, hard to find... ...and, uh, they ain't on your little, uh, hiking map. - We got the diary. - Good luck trying to read it. It looks like a mouse on mushrooms wrote it. - What up, Gomer? - Ooh. Hypergraphics. Synthesis of text and other media. There is a keen intelligence underneath this psychosis. What deal did you make? All the ribs he can eat and a 12-pack of beer. - And a Hustler. - Yeah, and that too. He can take us to the trailhead, but that's it. If it looks promising, we call the fire team from Special Operations. - Fine. - Jules, contact the ranger on duty... ...and make sure he meets us. Lloyd, stay here and go through the diary. We'll have satellite phones, so we'll always be in communication. I can look at it as I'm with you. I can hike. I can climb. This is not a Dungeons & Dragons game, Lloyd. - And I'm staying here, right? - Wrong. Dude, I'm from Washington Heights. I barely been on grass in my life. You're going. We're gonna be humping these mountains blind... ...and we need all the eyes to keep it tight and in sight. One wrong move, one stupid move, and I bury you up there. - I just want my ribs and beer, boss. CHARLIE: Let's move out. You be a good kitten, all right? Road's closed. You wanna hike up here, your need to get a permit... ...and leave your car at the park entrance. Rangers don't come up here this time of year, I thought. I saw your car pull off the road. Get yourself a permit so I don't have to cite you. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Help! Help me! Help me! RANGER: What the hell is going on here? Rangers don't come here this time of year. RANGER: No! GUNDERSON: Right here. ERICA: If it's so abandoned, then what's a park ranger truck doing here? SHEA: Seriously, Ray? Sinatra the whole ride up? CHARLIE: Damn. The keys are still in the ignition. SHEA: Blood. Over here. RAY: Debbie's car. Still warm. We gotta move. Let's gear up. I'll call in for that fire team. That could take two hours, easy. You see those old tire tracks? That's not a logging road. This is prime crop area for pot growers. Not for a long time, Captain Caveman. Feds cleaned it up. Product delays cost me a fleet of Benzes. But a lot of the traps they set in this part of the mountains... ...to protect their fields are still primed. No need to wait for backup. Take me with you. I'll get you where you need to go. Trust me. How about we don't take the cuffs off this hillbilly who you booted... ...once before already? You don't think he'd like to stick it back to you? We go up in these mountains, and he's the only one coming back. With a full belly. Don't worry, that's not happening. RAY: We can't wait, Charlie. We do, this girl's dead. I'll watch Gunderson. Come on, Charlie, you really want a dead girl on your conscience? You can trust me. ERICA: We don't need him. I know these woods like the back of my hand. How? - Chased a bail jumper who dumped a body. - You're telling us this now? Wanna keep asking questions or do you wanna find this girl? You can trust me. CHARLIE: I don't trust anybody today. We split up. Me and Shea, you and Erica. Stay in contact. Are you really gonna bet on that split-tail over me? - Looks like it. - Then you're gonna die up there. And I'm gonna laugh my ass off. Better know what the hell you're doing. Charlie. - You ready? - Let's go. DEBBIE: What is a grown man doing watching a children's show? BENNETT: What? - Good Night Kitten, my show. It's not a children's show. Sing it. Sing the song. [SINGING] Meow, meow, kitten Time to rest Don't you know I love you best? Now it's time to go away Yeah. Before we go I'll say.... That's right. Good night, Caitlin... ...and, um, Jacob and.... What's your name, sweetie? You know. - Bennett. - Right. Good night, Bennett. I love you. I can't make heads or tails of this. Sorry. [CLEARS THROAT] Do you want some coffee? - I'll leave you alone. - Schizophrenics who take their fixation... ...to the next level often latch on to symbolic elements. "R-B-F." "R-B-F." "R-B-F." It's all over this diary. What's it mean? LLOYD: R-B-F. It's a bird. Pull up everything there is on the red-bellied falcon. SHEA: Unh, we're in the middle of nowhere. Yo. I don't snitch, okay? So this isn't me pointing the finger at the other two. It's just me saying, man to man. I didn't take your watch. Look, as long as it's back on my desk by the end of the tour... ...I'm not asking any questions. Yeah, well, there's no use in you telling me that since I just told you I didn't take it. You heard what I said, Shea. Yeah, well, it doesn't make any sense, because.... [RATTLING] What the--? Homemade alarm system. Who knows what else they planted? This is why black people don't go camping. Let's go. We're losing daylight. [PHONE RINGS] Yeah? His obsessions graduated as he got older... ...from the violin to the taillights on trucks to survivalism to unrequited romance. - I don't need a dissertation, Lloyd. - The red-bellied falcon. That's what he was looking for in those mountains. It nests at 5000 feet, and there's only a quarter-mile section at that elevation. All right, I'll notify Ray on his phone. Keep me updated. It's gonna take all night to get through. Maybe I'll order some pizza. Is there any...? Yeah, okay. [ANIMAL SCREECHES] It's a fisher cat. Basically, a big weasel. Sure did study these mountains chasing that bail jumper. Sure did. Thanks. Nothing to do with the five guys who killed your father? The ones you allegedly made disappear? Allegedly. Call Charlie. We're on the right trail. There. See that nest? That's the nest of the red-bellied falcon. Probably out hunting now. You know, when they mate... ...they mate for life. That's beautiful. You remember their eggs? Those pretty eggs? We climbed that tree. You didn't think I could do it. No, you didn't. But I made it, all the way to the nest, on those thin little branches. You wouldn't think they'd hold your weight. Who are you talking to? There's nobody there. [CRYING] You sang to me... ...on your show. You said my name. You looked right in the camera, and you said: "Good night, Bennett." And then you went off to marry him! Please, Bennett. There's lots of other little boys out there named Bennett. If I've said your name before, it didn't mean anything. I'm sorry. We're gonna be together forever. Now, move. - Oh, my God. - Move! [SOBBING] DEBBIE: What are you gonna do with me? Why don't you just let me go? Please? Why don't you just kill yourself, you sick, crazy bastard? No. No, no, no. Oh, no, no, no. [SCREAMS THEN CRYING] Now your blood is the same as mine. We belong together, Debbie. Me and you. Don't talk about her like that! It's not true! She just doesn't understand yet! JULIANNE: Why is he obsessed with birds? LLOYD: Getting close to birds... ...while they mate in order to consummate some twisted marriage. His avian obsession had to symbolize something. - He's gonna marry her? LLOYD: Yeah. Then rape and kill her. In his mind, this woman he loves betrayed him... ...so he's gonna try to possess Debbie with the exact same ritual. He's very specific. He's obsessively detailed. There's an intricate ceremony he has laid out... ...and so he's gonna try to do it at a specific time. The power of two. Over here, the power of two again. Then these Escher-like drawings of cubes. - Hold on. Two cubed. - Eight. Eight o'clock. What time is it? Seven-thirty. [SHEA GRUNTS] SHEA: I don't even need a watch. What would I need a watch for? CHARLIE: Will you shut up already? [PHONE RINGS] - Yeah. LLOYD [OVER PHONE]: Charlie. Bennett's ceremony is at 8. You have a half hour. Shit. We don't have much time. Come on, Shea. You're amazing. Hmm? - What? - Nothing. [JULIANNE CLEARS THROAT] [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] BENNETT: The choppers don't see you. Now, stop crying. You're disgusting. Look at you. Clean yourself up, kitten. Today's your wedding day. Oh, my God, oh, my God. Help me. God, please help me. [PHONE RINGS] Hey, Charlie. What? Well, how does he know? ERICA: You took my father from me. MAN: Please, I wasn't the only one. ERICA: I know. Now it's four down, two to go. Please, I didn't pull the trigger. Like this, you mean? RAY: Erica. Erica. Erica. - Come on, we don't have much time. - Right. - You okay? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Let's go. [SCREAMS] Get this thing off! [HELICOPTER WHIRRING] DEBBIE: Please, please, please. RAY: Son of a bitch! - It's gonna be okay. Take deep breaths. Give me your knife. I think I see something. I think somebody's trying to signal. Go check it out. Go! Thank God, thank God. He's over there, but he's coming right back. - It's okay. We're gonna get you out of here. - Hurry, hurry. - Oh, my God. - Leave kitten alone! ERICA: Run, go, go, go, run! Go! - It's over, Bennett. - No. Drop the knife! DEBBIE [CRYING]: Oh, my God. SHEA: What the hell was that? [DEBBIE SCREAMS] Debbie, Debbie, I'm a U.S. Marshal. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - I'm a U.S. Marshal. You're safe now. - Help me. Oh, my God. Help me, please. Oh, my God, he's got her. - He's got who? - I don't know. Oh, my God. Damn it. Erica. Do you remember which way you came? - Remember? I don't know. CHARLIE: I need you to think, please. I don't know, five minutes back that way. Shea, stay with her, cut her loose. DEBBIE: Please help me. BENNETT: What are you doing? Got anything you wanna say? There's one thing I swore I'd never do... ...and that is beg for my life. You ruined everything. LLOYD: It's 8:00. I hope they got to her. The most painless way to kill an animal is to chop off the head in one quick swoop... ...but if the knife isn't sharp enough... ...the next thing is to cut the throat at the carotid artery... ...then press firmly on the neck so that the blood drains quickly. Sometimes... ...the bottom part of the body continues to move. That's what happens with birds. That's what's gonna happen with you. CHARLIE: Bennett! I just wanna talk. This woman took away what's mine. Bennett, your brother Calvin, he wants you to come back home. I am home. Put it down, Bennett. Last warning. - Say good night. - Charlie! [BENNETT GRUNTS] You okay? Jules, will you get this stubborn bastard to a hospital, please? The rest of you, get changed up so I can take you back to Maybelle. - Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine. Uh, Debbie's with her fiancé, she's doing fine. And, uh, Gunderson wants to know when he can get his ribs... - ...and beer and the Hustler. CHARLIE: All right. Charles, I hear congratulations are in order for your marksmanship. Unh, all right, Jules, I'll be back in a sec. [GRUNTING] What the hell are you still doing here? - Who took it? - The paper towel holder in the bathroom. Oh, man. That's on me. I took it off and left it there to clean my shirt. - They're gonna light me up. RAY: You're right. And you'll lose credibility. - So don't tell them. - What? You found it on your desk. Someone returned it. Simple. I gotta run. I'll see you later. You ready, Jules? My father's watch. I misplaced it. No one took it. There you have it. Good job on this caper. Let's go. Did I just hear what I think I heard? I think so. Let's go. LLOYD: Pretty sure I didn't hear an apology in there. [English - US -SDH]
