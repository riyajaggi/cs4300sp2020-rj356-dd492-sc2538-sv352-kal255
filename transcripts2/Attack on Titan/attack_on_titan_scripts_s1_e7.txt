   [NARRATOR] They first appeared over a hundred years ago. [NARRATOR] Giant, humanoid creatures [NARRATOR] with a taste for our blood. [NARRATOR] The brute strength of these aberrations trumped [NARRATOR] an average person's many times over. [NARRATOR] We were shoved to the brink [NARRATOR] of extinction almost overnight. [NARRATOR] The survivors erected Walls Maria, Rose, and Sina; [NARRATOR] withdrawing behind them in frightened huddles [NARRATOR] for what was to be a century of uneasy peace. [NARRATOR] In the year 845, two terrifying new breeds [NARRATOR] of Titan appeared: the Colossal and the Armored, [NARRATOR] barreling through the outer walls as if [NARRATOR] wholesale destruction was child's play. [NARRATOR] The territory couched within the circle [NARRATOR] of Wall Maria was abandoned. [NARRATOR] Twenty percent of the human race perished. [NARRATOR] As the Titan onslaught advanced, [NARRATOR] our only choice was to withdrawal behind Wall Rose. [NARRATOR] In the year 850, the Colossal appeared once again, [NARRATOR] breaching the wall bordering Trost [NARRATOR] before disappearing. [NARRATOR] The Titans flooded in through the broken gate. Eren! No! [Armin screaming] [NARRATOR] Two hours later, the evacuation of [NARRATOR] the entire populace was complete. [NARRATOR] As a result, [NARRATOR] no civilians were lost to the Titans. [NARRATOR] The same cannot be said for the countless soldiers [NARRATOR] who perished, buying the people time. [MIKASA] Eren. As long as you're part of my life, [MIKASA] I can fight to the bitter end. [MALE SOLDIER] Captain, please wait! [MALE SOLDIER] There's only a handful of us left, sir. [MALE SOLDIER] If the Titans were to attack here in force, [MALE SOLDIER] we wouldn't have a chance in hell [MALE SOLDIER] of holding them off! [FEMALE SOLDIER] Please, sir. We need you here! Out of my way, soldier. We have to get going. My expertise is needed to help direct the reinforcements. Behind the safety of the inner gate. Am I right? Just what the hell are you implying? They need my help reorganizing. Or would you rather us be overwhelmed due to a logistical nightmare! But-- But sir! If we lose those supplies-- That's enough! Question my orders again, or delay me in my duties, and I'll run your treasonous hide straight through! Why isn't anyone going over the wall? They must have heard the withdrawal signal. It's over. All over. We're doomed. [weeping] [Titan growling] [whimpering] There! [FEMALE SOLDIER] C'mon now. That musket's [FEMALE SOLDIER] not enough to stop them. [FEMALE SOLDIER] Huh? [gun shot] [screaming] [CONNY] Hey, Jean. What're we gonna do? We can't do anything. They finally gave us the order to withdraw. And we were all out of gas, of course. I can't believe this is how it's going to end. Because of those damned cowards! Y'mean the supply depot? What is going on? Where are they? They all lost their will to fight. And I can understand why. [JEAN] But they abandoned their duty to supply us, [JEAN] barricading themselves inside HQ. [JEAN] And of course, Titans have swarmed the place, [JEAN] which means we can't get the gas ourselves. Then why're we waitin'? We gotta go. Start thinning their numbers so we have a chance! [CONNY] Sitting here on this roof is totally pointless! [CONNY] Eventually the Titans are gonna come for us. We don't have much gas left. We'll just waste what little we've got if we try to run. And without our mobility, [CONNY] we're completely screwed! You're using your head for once, Conny. Nice going. But I'm just not sure if we've got the numbers needed to pull this thing off. The veterans in the Vanguard force have all been killed. [JEAN] How, exactly, do a bunch of rookies pull off [JEAN] a suicide mission like this? [JEAN] I mean, let's assume half of our force [JEAN] even survives the initial assault. [JEAN] Then what? The supply room is probably crawling with [JEAN] Titans in the three or four meter range. [JEAN] I don't see us accomplishing much in there. It's hopeless. God, what a dull life this turned out to be. I never even got to tell her just how I feel. [SASHA] C'mon guys, we can do it! Right? Let's go. If we all work together, we can make this happen, [SASHA] I know we can! All right? I'll take the lead. Armin! It's time to go. [ANNIE] Reiner. Do we move out? Not yet. We have to let them gather up first. [MARCO] It's no use. There's too many of them. I don't think any of us are going to survive this. I've come to accept my pending demise. [MARCO] I just... wanted my death to mean something. [CADET] Mikasa! Weren't you with the rearguard? [MIKASA] Annie! I know how bad things have gotten. It's selfish. Putting personal matters in the forefront, but have you seen Eren's squad? Some squads made it back. But I don't know about Eren's. We found Armin, he's over there. [MIKASA] Armin! Mikasa! I can't. How do I tell her what happened to Eren? I survived, and it means nothing. I'm so useless! [ARMIN] I wish I had died with him instead! Armin. Are you okay? You're not hurt, are you? Where is Eren? [MIKASA] Armin? [Armin crying] [ARMIN] They were-- The cadets of Squad 34. Thomas Wagner. [ARMIN] Nack Tierce. Milieus Zeremski. Mina Carolina. [ARMIN] Eren Jaeger! [ARMIN] These brave five upheld their duties. [ARMIN] They died valiantly on the field of battle! [Armin weeping] Please, no. [CADET 1] His whole squad was wiped out? [CADET 2] The same will happen to us [CADET 2] if we try to take on those Titans. [weeping] I'm so sorry, Mikasa! It should have been me that died, not Eren! I-- I couldn't do a thing! I'm worthless. [MIKASA] Armin. Calm yourself. We haven't got time for you to get emotional right now. Huh? [MIKASA] On your feet. [MIKASA] Marco. If we eliminate or bypass the Titans at HQ, we can there refuel our gear, allowing us to get back over the wall. Is that assessment correct? Well-- Uh yeah I guess so, sure. But there's just too many of them out there. Even with you on point. I can do it. What? I'm strong. Real strong. [MIKASA] None of you come close. You hear me? [MIKASA] I am a warrior. Know this. I have the power to slay all of the Titans that block our path! Even if I have to do it alone. [MIKASA] As far as I'm concerned, I am surrounded by [MIKASA] a bunch of unskilled, cowardly worms. [MIKASA] You dissappoint me. You can just sit here [MIKASA] and twiddle your thumbs, and watch how it's done! Wait, Mikasa. Are you out of your mind? That's crazy! You can't be serious! Trying to take them out by yourself? There's no way you can hope to beat them! If I can't beat them, then I die. But, if I win, I live. And the only way to win is to fight! [MARCO] Hey! You know, I was expecting something more motivational. Your way with words was kind of a let down. I blame everything about this on you, Eren! Hey! Don't just stand there! We weren't taught to [JEAN] let our comrades fight alone! [JEAN] 'Less you are a coward, in which case [JEAN] stay out of my way! Never expected that from him. ♪ Hey! Seriously? C'mon, you bunch of chickens! [CADET] They're nuts! Damn it. All right, let's go! [rally cry] [JEAN] Hurry up! Follow Mikasa! Avoid fighting, if you can. [JEAN] And get to HQ before you run out of gas! Whoa, Mikasa is a badass! [CONNY] How is she going so fast? No! Mikasa's using too much gas! [ARMIN] She could run out at any second! [ARMIN] It doesn't matter how skilled she is. [ARMIN] Once we lose mobility, we're as good as dead! ♪ [ARMIN] I see through the veil of her composure. She's letting adrenaline distract her from grief! [ARMIN] At any time, she could... Mikasa! Damn! Jean! You lead the rest to HQ! I'm going after Armin! [JEAN] I'll go with you! [CONNY] Don't be stupid! There are still Titans everywhere! You've gotta help the others! It happened. Why this again? [MIKASA] I've lost my family. [MIKASA] Why? Wasn't the first time enough? It's all over. Nothing left for them to take from me. [Titan footsteps] [JEAN] It's no use. We're not getting [JEAN] anywhere near Headquarters. [JEAN] Unless, of course, we don't mind dying. [Cadet wimpering] Shit! He's out of gas! Stay back! [MOBB] Tom! I'll save you! No, wait! [CADET] I'm comin'! [crying] Stop it! [crying] [screaming] Why couldn't I stop them? Why didn't I stop them? If I'd kept us all together, this never would have happened! [screaming] [JEAN] I wasn't meant to lead. I'm the last person that should've been given the reigns! [FEMALE CADET] No! [screaming] [MALE CADET] I hope you choke on me, you bastard! [Female Cadet screaming] [FEMALE CADET] No! No! [Female Cadet screaming] ♪ [MIKASA] This world is cruel. But it's also-- It's also beautiful. [Titan footsteps] It was a good life. [Titan footsteps] ♪ Why? [MIKASA] I'd already given up. [MIKASA] So why-- Why am I struggling? [MIKASA] Why do I keep getting up? [MIKASA] Why am I still fighting? [MIKASA] I mean, I've lost any reason to live. [MIKASA] What keeps pushing me? [EREN] Fight! Fight! Fight! Eren. [EREN] Kill or be killed! [EREN] The only way to live is to fight! I'm so sorry, Eren. I'm through giving up. I'll never give up again. [MIKASA] Because if I die, these memories of you die with me. [MIKASA] That's why I'll do whatever it takes to win! [MIKASA] Whatever it takes to live! [war cry] What was that? [growling] [howling] [growling] [MIKASA] That Titan. He's... killing-- [MIKASA] He's killing the other one. ♪ Please be all right. I'm coming for you! [ARMIN] There she is! Mikasa! Are you okay? Are you guys all right? Yeah. Then we better get outta here! [CONNY] Crap. Two fifteen-meter Titans! No. That one's different. How? [roar] [roar] Huh? [growl] [ARMIN] It-- It just finished it off. [ARMIN] He knew exactly where the weak spot was! [CONNY] C'mon guys, time to split! [CONNY] Last thing we need is him coming our way! No. He has no reaction to us. Any other Titan would've been on top of us by now! It seemed to understand the skill of hand-to-hand combat. What is that thing? Just chalk it up as another Abnormal! Hell, they're always an unpleasant surprise, right? Forget about it. Let's just get outta here! [ARMIN] Wait a minute, hold on. Mikasa's tanks are empty! [CONNY] Huh? What are we gonna do? [CONNY] We can't clear HQ without your help! There's only one thing to do. I know there isn't very much left in them, [ARMIN] but it's better than your empty ones. Armin! This is our only choice! [ARMIN] It'll be a complete waste if I keep them. But-- Use this gas more sparingly. Everyone's lives are riding on you. What have I done? I led the attack [MIKASA] without any regard for their lives at all. [MIKASA] I was even reckless with my own life. [MIKASA] I lost track of what you taught me. [MIKASA] Oh, Eren. I'm so ashamed. [MIKASA] Eren. [ARMIN] There! Got it! The ODM gear's functional. [ARMIN] And I restocked your blades. [ARMIN] Just-- Just leave me this one, okay? [ARMIN] It's just that, I would rather this be my end, [ARMIN] not being eaten alive. Why'd you--? [MIKASA] Armin. I will not leave you behind. [MIKASA] What was he? [MIKASA] Are there any more like him? [MIKASA] I've never heard of a Titan killing another Titan. [MIKASA] No one has. [MIKASA] But it struck a chord in me. [MIKASA] Something so familiar. So primal. [roar] [MIKASA] I bore witness to [MIKASA] the manifestation of humanity's rage. [growl] [NARRATOR] A Titan killing a Titan. [NARRATOR] The very sight of it in action leaves [NARRATOR] the 104th Cadet Corps Class completely speechless. [NARRATOR] However, the cadets have [NARRATOR] much more in store for them.
