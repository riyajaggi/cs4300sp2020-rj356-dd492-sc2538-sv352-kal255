   Will we abandon the tactics that cost tens of thousands of lives to develop,
 and let the Titans eat us without a fight?
 I know we have to fight...
 But not everyone is as eager to die as you.
 I hope you won't get mad when I say this...
 But you aren't a strong person.
 So you can relate to how the weak feel.
 In addition, you excel in sizing up any situation.
 Isn't that why you immediately know what should be done?
 What should be done...

 Have you decided which one you're joining?
 I have.
 I...
 I...
 I'm joining the Survey Corps!
 Damn it.
 Hey, Annie, what did you think?
 Even Jean said he's joining the Survey Corps.

 You're joining the Military Police right?
 Maybe I should, too.

 I see... You've made your choice.
 Yeah.
