   Attention! [PYXIS] The blueprint of the [PYXIS] Trost Recovery Operation is this. That's where this fellow comes in. Allow me to introduce Cadet Eren Jager. [PYXIS] Don't let appearances deceive you. [PYXIS] This young man is in fact [PYXIS] the successful product of cutting-edge science. [PYXIS] Recall the massive boulder [PYXIS] roughly a league from the gate. [PYXIS] Having assumed Titan form, Cadet Jaeger will [PYXIS] hoist said boulder on his back, [PYXIS] schlep it to the hole, and voila! [PYXIS] And this is where you all come in. [PYXIS] Your job will be to defend him. Yes. [PYXIS] Defend a Titan against his own kind. Should we succeed, we'll make history! [PYXIS] Today is the day! [PYXIS] Lands taken by our greatest enemy [PYXIS] will be reclaimed! [PYXIS] Now, it may seem an insignificant plot of land [PYXIS] compared to the vast tracts of [PYXIS] former glory long abandoned. [PYXIS] But as a symbol. As an idea. [PYXIS] Trost regained shall stand as a reclamation of [PYXIS] pride and hope beyond measure! [PYXIS] A leap greater than we have ever taken! [MIKASA] Eren! I know you're in there! Snap out it! Come on! We need you! Get out of there! [MITABI] What the hell? [MITABI] You tellin' me the kid was a regular Titan all along? [IAN] Our job now is to keep the others off him until he can be recovered. Whether we like it or not he's still our last best chance. [IAN] We're not about to abandon him. [IAN] We're expendable. He isn't. [EREN] Wait. [EREN] That's right, of course. [CONNY] Jean! [CONNY] And why the hell isn't he using his gear? Hang on! [CONNY] Don't tell me it's not working! I am not going to die today! [ARMIN] Mikasa! Why'd the plan go belly-up? [MIKASA] We've had to shift tac. [MIKASA] Right now all we can do is protect him. [MIKASA] He's defenseless. [MIKASA] And there's-- There's just so many. [MIKASA] I don't know how much longer we can keep this up! [ARMIN] From the back of the head to the nape of the neck. [ARMIN] One meter high and ten centimeters across! Tell me, honestly. [ARMIN] Even though your first step beyond the wall meant [ARMIN] the difference between a warm hearth and hell on earth. [ARMIN] Why? Why throw caution to the wind [ARMIN] and venture outside? What kind of question is that? [EREN] Because the world beyond the wall is my birthright! [roar] Eren! [roar] Way to go. Draggin' everybody down. Great job. [JEAN] Maybe I won't die today. What are we going to do, Captain? [FEMALE SQUAD] We're all that's left! We fall back to the boulder! [IAN] Status report! [MALE SQUAD] Five Titans approaching from the gate, sir! If I wait for the all-clear I'll never make it out alive! I've got to do something! Jean! [CONNY] His gear is busted! What's happening? [JEAN] Damn it! Ugh. Come on! Work with me here! [CONNY] Jean! Look out! [JEAN] Marco! What the hell are you doing? Crap. Why you gotta go be the hero? What? You've got to be kidding me. Why is the trigger so stiff? [CONNY] Jean! [CONNY] Ow! Are you insane? What are you waiting for? Get out of there! ♪ ♪ ♪ You idiots got a death wish? Don't even start, man. Yeah! You scared the hell outta me! I'll be damned. [Titan footsteps] [Titan footsteps] ♪ Eren. [ARMIN] Mikasa! [MIKASA] Armin! He came out of it somehow! We're set! He's determined to see the mission through to the end! [ARMIN] As long as we've got his back [ARMIN] while he heads for the wall, victory will be ours! [IAN] Defend him! [IAN] To the last man if that's what it comes to! [IAN] Eren must reach the gate! [IAN] I don't want a single Titan anywhere near him! It looks like we're back on! Focus on keeping Eren safe! The both of you, go! I want you with Eren immediately! Hop to, soldiers! That's an order! [BOTH] Sir, yes sir! [IAN] Team Mitabi! What are you doing? The ugly sons-a-bitches have lost all interest in us! We need to get close enough to grab their attention! Hey big guy, over here! You walkin' away? Maybe you want us to shove our blades right up your smelly asses? [SQUAD 1] It worked! [SQUAD 2] We've got two of 'em! Alright! Make a B-line for the buildings! [ARMIN] They're insane! [ARMIN] Setting foot down there is suicide! If they get cornered somewhere there'll be nothing they can do! [IAN] Yeah. I know. Let's move out. Everyone, follow Team Mitabi! Come on. We need to go. [IAN] Over here! Come get me! [EREN TITAN] I feel like-- Like I'm about to [EREN TITAN] buckle under the weight. [EREN TITAN] Mikasa. Armin. [EREN TITAN] What are you doing? [EREN TITAN] Get to the rooftops! You'll be killed! Hey! What's the matter? Can't catch me? [MALE SQUAD] You never will with that attitude-- [screaming] No! Damn it! [MALE SQUAD] Mitabi! Why? Why throw caution to the wind and venture outside? [EREN TITAN] We're born free. All of us. [screaming] [EREN TITAN] Free. [EREN TITAN] Some don't believe it. [EREN TITAN] Some try to take it away. [EREN TITAN] To hell with them! [EREN TITAN] Water like fire. [EREN TITAN] Mountains of ice. The whole bit. [EREN TITAN] Lay your eyes on that, [EREN TITAN] and you'll know what freedom is. [EREN TITAN] That it's worth fighting for! [EREN TITAN] Fight to live! Risk it all for even [EREN TITAN] a glimmer of real freedom! [screaming] [EREN TITAN] It doesn't matter what's waiting outside the gate, [EREN TITAN] or what comes in. [EREN TITAN] It doesn't matter how cruel the world can be! [EREN TITAN] Or how unjust! [EREN TITAN] Fight! Fight! Fight! [EREN TITAN] Fight! [ARMIN] There's still one ahead of us! [MIKASA] I'll take care of it! Out of the way! [small roar] [battle cry] Go! [EREN TITAN] Fight! ♪ ♪ Comrades. Your sacrifices weren't in vain. [gun fire] We have made history. This day belongs to humanity! [ANKA] Definitely yellow smoke, sir. Oh my god. The mission was a success! Deploy all reinforcements. [PYXIS] Bring the Elite Squad home. [RICO] Mind the stragglers! Ackerman! Pull back! With all due respect, I'm not withdrawing until I recover Eren! [MIKASA] Armin! How is he? [ARMIN] Unconscious and scorching to the touch! There we go. [ARMIN] We have to get him up the wall! Uh oh, damn it. He's fused to the carcass! I can't work him free! [RICO] Then we cut. Wait! We don't know what that might do! Eren! Armin! ♪ ♪ Mikasa! Who's that? [EREN] The wings... of freedom. Pay attention, kiddos. [LEVI] This is the part where you explain to me [LEVI] exactly what it is I'm looking at. [NARRATOR] Afterward, thanks to the coordinated efforts of [NARRATOR] the Scout Regiment and [NARRATOR] the Garrison Regiment's Corps of Engineers, [NARRATOR] Wall Rose once against stood as [NARRATOR] a bulwark against the Titan hordes. [NARRATOR] It was a full day's work dispatching the Titans [NARRATOR] who remained corralled within [NARRATOR] Trost's perimeter, during which [NARRATOR] the wall-mounted cannons fired ceaselessly. [NARRATOR] Most of the Titans nearest the wall [NARRATOR] were wiped out by explosive shells. [NARRATOR] The few that remained once the smoked cleared were [NARRATOR] summarily cut down by the Scout Regiment. [NARRATOR] During the so-called cleanup operation, two Titans, [NARRATOR] a 4-meter and a 7-meter, were captured [NARRATOR] alive and successfully restrained. [NARRATOR] However... [NARRATOR] All told, 207 people were either dead or missing. [NARRATOR] 897 were counted among the injured. [NARRATOR] So while the reclamation of Trost [NARRATOR] represented the first true victory for humanity [NARRATOR] in its fight against the Titans, [NARRATOR] too many soldiers had fallen [NARRATOR] for celebration to be in order. [JEAN] I-Is-- [JEAN] Is that... Marco? [DOCTOR] If you have a name for this one, [DOCTOR] it'd be helpful to pass it along. [JEAN] I wondered where he was. But he's-- He's not the sort of guy... who, you know-- Marco. What happened? [JEAN] No. Somebody saw it. Had to've. [JEAN] Somebody knows how he went out. [DOCTOR] I need his name. We don't have time for this. Please, son. You understand? It's been two days since we bored up the hole in Wall Rose. That's too long. We're nowhere near accounting for all the dead. Unless these poor souls are dealt with soon, an epidemic is likely to break out. [DOCTOR] We're the first line of defense [DOCTOR] against secondary disaster. [DOCTOR] We'll lament the fallen after we've done our jobs. Is that understood? [JEAN] He was a member of the 104th Cadet Corps, [JEAN] captain of Squad 19. Marco Bodt. Bodt. Duly noted, then. Thank you, cadet. I appreciate the help. Continue. [SASHA] Wha-- What is this thing? Leftover Titan vomit. [ELITE A] Apparently they don't have a digestive tract, [ELITE A] so once they've had their fill of people, [ELITE A] they upchuck them like hairballs. That's sick. Ugh. So gross. Can't even make out a face. [ANNIE] I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I... Contrition does them no good. What they need is a proper burial. [MAN] Any questions? [EREN] That's Commander Erwin, [EREN] head of the Scout Regiment's Task Force. [EREN] What's he doing here? And Captain Levi? Uh... I, uh-- [EREN] Where... [EREN] Where am I? [ERWIN] I think it's obvious. Let's just call it a dungeon. [ERWIN] You're currently in the custody of the Military Police. [ERWIN] We were granted permission to [ERWIN] see you only just now. [chains rattling] Where'd you get that? [ERWIN] Off of you. Don't worry, you'll get it back. Let's talk home. Specifically the good doctor's cellar back in Shiganshina. Pretty big secret in there, right? [ERWIN] About the Titans? Yeah. I think so. That's what Dad said anyway. Must suck having your dad and your memory MIA at the same time. Unless, of course, that's just a cover story. Enough. We've been over this already. We know he has no reason to lie. And that's all we know. How 'bout you shed a little light on things for me by telling us your intentions. M-- My what? What do you mean? [ERWIN] Here's the lay of the land, my friend. [ERWIN] If we want to pay your dad's cellar a visit, [ERWIN] we have to venture back into Shiganshina. [ERWIN] Sealing the breach there as we did in Trost would be [ERWIN] the smart way to go about it, don't you think? [ERWIN] Naturally, we'll need your special powers. [ERWIN] Any way you slice it, a Titan's deciding our fate. [ERWIN] It's been conjectured that the Colossal [ERWN] and the Armored Titan [ERWIN] are more or less the same as you. It's why I ask your intentions. They could be the key to turning the tide forever. [ERWIN] You could save us. I don't know what I am. [EREN TITAN] No. This is over. [EREN TITAN] I'm going to put a stop to this! [EREN] I'll kill them with my bare hands! [LEVI] C'mon. It's an easy question. So answer it. What the hell is it you wanna do? I want to become a member of the Scouts and slaughter every Titan that crosses my path! Huh. Well played. [LEVI] Alright, then. I'll take responsibility for him. [LEVI] Let the higher-ups know what's going on. Not that I implicitly trust him, of course. It's more a matter of me trusting myself to deal with him. Kill him, if I have to. The big wigs aren't likely to raise a stink. My record more than speaks for itself, I'm pretty sure. [LEVI] Good news, Jaeger. [LEVI] You're now officially a member of the Scouts. [NARRATOR] A special court marshal. [NARRATOR] Eren is released from his underground cell [NARRATOR] only to be dragged before a tribunal of [NARRATOR] the military's highest ranking officials. [NARRATOR] The issue being decided? [NARRATOR] Whether he lives or dies.
