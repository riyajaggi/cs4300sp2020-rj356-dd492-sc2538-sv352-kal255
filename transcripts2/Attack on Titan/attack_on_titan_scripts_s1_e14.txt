   [LEVI] C'mon. It's an easy question. So answer it. What the hell is it you want to do? I want to become a member of the Scouts, and slaughter every Titan that crosses my path. Huh. Well played. [LEVI] Alright, then. I'll take responsibility for him. [LEVI] Let the higher-ups know what's going on. Not that I implicitly trust him, of course. It's more a matter of me trusting myself to deal with him. Kill him, if I have to. The big wigs aren't likely to raise a stink. My record more than speaks for itself, I'm pretty sure. [LEVI] Good news, Jaeger. [LEVI] You're now officially a member of the Scouts. [MAN 1] Hey. You think it's true? [MAN 1] There's a Titan fighting on our side now? [MAN 2] When did you start believing everything you heard? [MAN 2] More likely the recapture plan failed. [MAN 2] And now refugees from Wall Rose [MAN 2] are going to start flooding in here. [MAN 3] And once those people swarm us, [MAN 3] our supplies'll run out in a matter of days. [MAN 1] Wait. So if the Wall Rose people really do [MAN 1] have a Titan with them, [MAN 1] you don't think they'd be crazy enough to [MAN 1] bring him in here, do you? [MAN 4] Hey. Have you heard the good news? [MAN 4] The military has a Titan on the team! [MAN 4] Can you believe it? Who knows? [MAN 4] We might even be able to retake Wall Maria! [MAN 4] Finally, humanity has a Savior! [various joy] [MAN] Saviour, huh? Since the dawn of history, commoners have always been a rash lot. These rumors get any more out of control, we'll have a revolt on our hands. Not today. This so-called "Savior"? We'll make an example out of him. [MAN] I'll be damned if he's allowed to join the Survey Corp. Form ranks! All hail to the Premier! Damn, hot day. [ERWIN] Commander Pyxis. You're the C.O. of the Garrison Regiment. And I'm the Commanding Officer of the Survey Corp and the Scouts. [ERWIN] Some people might disapprove of [ERWIN] our meeting like this. [PYXIS] Ha! You're as straight- laced as your reputation. [PYXIS] Nothing untoward here. We just coincidentally [PYXIS] bumped into one another while out for a morning stroll. [PYXIS] Protocol doesn't prevent us from [PYXIS] chatting under the circumstances. You are aware the Military Police plan to take custody of Eren Jaeger, I presume. [ERWIN] Yes. I received word yesterday. [ERWIN] They plan to hold a deliberation on the matter. [PYXIS] Hm. The decision has been left to Premier Zachary. [PYXIS] Whether Cadet Jaeger's future lies with the Scouts, [PYXIS] or in the hands of the Military Police. [ERWIN] Zachary? You mean Premier Dhalis Zachary? [PYXIS] The Military Police. The Garrison Regiment. [PYXIS] And the Scouts. [PYXIS] All three fall under his jurisdiction. [PYXIS] His decision will be based entirely on one factor: [PYXIS] Is Eren Jaeger's existence a benefit [PYXIS] or a handicap to our survival? [PYXIS] If deemed detrimental, Jaeger will be [PYXIS] executed without a thought. [PYXIS] Right then and there, if need be. [PYXIS] I, for one, do not want to see him die. [PYXIS] However, many in the Garrison Regiment, [PYXIS] I'm sad to say, are fearful of Eren's unique ability. My hands are tied. The most I can do is avoid agreeing with the M.P.'s. [PYXIS] Do the odds favor you? No, they don't. And yet, we do have a proposal prepared. [ERWIN] Whether it will work or not, [ERWIN] all depends on how the debate unfolds. You mean, you're going to play it by ear? Our job is reconnaissance beyond the walls. Playing things by ear is all we ever do. Ha! [laughing] [PYXIS] You're not so uptight after all, it would seem. [PYXIS] Thank you for the pleasant conversation. [PYXIS] And good luck, Commander! [MIKASA] A debate over Eren? What for? [ARMIN] I'm not really sure, but, it might be about what they plan to do with him. And what does that mean? It means... they may not let him live. Cadet Mikasa Ackerman. And Cadet Armin Arlelt. Hop to! [MIKASA] Sir! [OFFICER] You're ordered to attend and act as witnesses at today's deliberation. [EREN] 'Scuse me. I gotta pee. No, you just went. Then can I have some water? [GUARD] Hey! You're not getting a thing, got it? Damn monster. [EREN] Monster. I guess he's not too far off the mark there. [EREN] Frightened of me or not, though, [EREN] I don't deserve this. [EREN] Except how can I blame him? [EREN] I don't even understand what's going on. [EREN] On the bright side, at least these guards [EREN] haven't tried to kill me yet. [EREN] When I think back, they weren't afraid of me. [EREN] Even after everything they'd seen. [EREN] I wonder what they're doing now. [EREN] And all the others. I wonder what happened to them. [ERWIN] Just hang on a little longer, Eren. [ERWIN] We'll keep trying to sort all this out. [EREN] I've been in here so long. [EREN] What's been happening outside of these bars? [EREN] I'm-- I'm not going to spend [EREN] the rest of my life like this, am I? So then, you're Eren? [HANGE] Are you well? How're things? [HANGE] I'm really sorry you've been waiting so long. [HANGE] But here's your chance to finally get out. Uh. One thing. You'll have to put these on for me, okay? [HANGE] My name is Zoe Hange. I'm a section commander for the Scouts. This is a fellow commander in the Scouts, [HANGE] Miche Zacharius. Uh... [HANGE] Oh. Don't mind him. He makes a habit of [HANGE] giving new people a thorough sniff. [HANGE] Tends to laugh through his nose a bit. [HANGE] But I don't think he intends it to be derisive. [HANGE] Quirks aside, he is a skilled section commander. Oh, poo! Sorry. I've just been prattling on [HANGE] with the small talk, and now we're here! [HANGE] Well, I'm sure it's fine. [HANGE] It's probably better if I don't explain, anyway. Hey! Hold on! [HANGE] It might seem callous, but remember... we've all put our faith in you, Eren. Best of luck! [EREN] Wait! [EREN] A courthouse? [EREN] I was in the basement of a courthouse this whole time? [GUARD] All right. Move it! On your knees. Now! [EREN] Why're all of these people here, just staring at me? [EREN] Somebody gonna explain what the hell's going on? [EREN] My friends. [door opening, then closing] All right. Shall we begin? Your name is Eren Jaeger. And as a soldier, you have sworn to give up your life when called to, [ZACHARY] for the good of the people. Is that correct? Yes. [ZACHARY] As an enlisted soldier during a time of war, [ZACHARY] military doctrine demands your tribunal be held as a court-martial. As Commander of our armed forces, this matter is left to my discretion. Thus, I will decide whether you live or you die. [ARMIN] I knew it! [ZACHARY] Any objections? No, sir. [ZACHARY] Your astuteness is appreciated. Let us proceed. As expected, covering up your existence has proven quite fruitless. [ZACHARY] And unless we publicly disclose your existence [ZACHARY] one way or another, we risk the outbreak [ZACHARY] of widespread civil unrest. [ZACHARY] A choice must be made. [ZACHARY] And the regiment that takes custody of you [ZACHARY] will determine your fate. [ZACHARY] The Military Police... [ZACHARY] or the Scout Regiment? [ZACHARY] To begin. The Military Police [ZACHARY] will now present their case. [MAN] Thank you. My name is Nile Dawk. [NILE] I am Commander of the Military Police. Our recommendation, following a thorough examination of his physiology, subject Eren Jaeger should be disposed of immediately. [NILE] We acknowledge that Jaeger's ability played a part in turning back the latest Titan incursion. [NILE] However, as has been stated, his mere existence [NILE] is creating a swell of rebellious sentiment. For the greater good, after we have gathered all the information that we can from him, we would see him made a fallen warrior of humanity. [MAN] Unacceptable! This verminous fiend has defiled the mighty Wall... [EREN] Another deranged Wall Cultist. [EREN] Five years ago, everyone ignored them. [EREN] Now they've actually got some clout. And now I'd like to hear the Scout Regiment's proposed plan. [ERWIN] Yes, sir. As the commander of the Survey Corp, I, Erwin Smith, propose the following: Let Eren join our ranks. Reinstate him as a full member of the Scouts, and we will utilize [ERWIN] his Titan ability to retake Wall Maria. That is all. [ZACHARY] Hm? Is that it? [ERWIN] Yes. With his assistance, sir, [ERWIN] I'm certain we can reclaim Wall Maria. [ERWIN] Ergo, I believe our top priority is perfectly clear. Quite bold. Assuming you were given clearance, where do you plan to launch this operation from? Commander Pyxis. The wall in Trost District has been completely sealed, is that correct? [PYXIS] Yes. I doubt its gate will ever open again. [ERWIN] We'll depart from Calaneth District, to the east. From there, we'll make for Shiganshina. A new route can be establish as we proceed. But that's ridiculous! Our time and money would be better spent sealing up all the gates! They're the only parts of the Wall that the Colossal Titan can break, right? Let's reinforce the blasted things and wash our hands of the entire affair! [SCOUT 14] Shut your mouth, you spineless merchant dog! [SCOUT 14] With a Titan on our side, [SCOUT 14] we can finally return to Wall Maria! [MERCHANT] We can't afford any more of your childish antics, [MERCHANT] or your delusions of grandeur! Squealing louder won't help your case, pig. [LEVI] While we're bolstering our defenses, do you think the Titans are going to stand idly by? And when you say "we can't afford," do you speak for anyone other than your fat merchant friends? [LEVI] Do you pigs even realize that most of our people [LEVI] are struggling just to survive off [LEVI] what little land we have left? I'm simply saying that sealing the gates is the only guaranteed protection we've got! Hold your tongue, you vile, belligerent heretic! Are you really suggesting that we lowly humans meddle with Wall Rose, a gift to us from on high? [MAN] The Wall is a miracle. [MAN] And its divinity transcends human comprehension. [MAN] Don't you understand? It's that cult's fault. They're the ones who delayed the garrison's arming of the Walls. That shows you the sick amount of support and power they've got. I don't trust them at all. [MERCHANT] ...to pieces! [MAN] Such sacrilege! [MERCHANT] Oh, you're insane. Shut yer trap! [MAN] How dare you! [ZACHARY] Order! I ask that you save your personal [ZACHARY] sentiments for a more appropriate venue. [ZACHARY] Now then Mr. Jaeger, I have a question for you. [ZACHARY] As a soldier, you have made a solemn pledge [ZACHARY] to answer humanity's call. [ZACHARY] Can you still serve by controlling your ability? Yes! I will, sir! [ZACHARY] Oh? Is that so? But this report from the Battle for Trost contradicts that statement. Just after transforming, [ZACHARY] it seems you made an attempt to [ZACHARY] crush Mikasa Ackerman. [ARMIN] He doesn't even remember. [ARMIN] He completely lost control. What'd you expect? You want me to lie in the report? Glossing over that important fact could potentially spell disaster for us all. [ZACHARY] And who is this Mikasa Ackerman? Me! That would be me, sir. Alright, then. Is it true that Eren Jaeger assaulted you while he was in Titan form? Answer the Premier honestly. Eren's future depends on it. Yes. All of that's true. [whispers and gasps] [MERCHANT] I knew it! He's a wolf in sheep's clothing! [EREN] I-- I tried to kill Mikasa? [EREN] What's happening to me? [MIKASA] However, he also saved my life twice before. And in each circumstance he was using his Titan ability. The first: shortly after Trost fell. [MIKASA] I was nearly killed by a Titan. [MIKASA] But then Eren came. [MIKASA] He stepped in and protected me. [MIKASA] The second time: he transformed to [MIKASA] shield Armin and me from cannon fire. I implore you to take these facts into consideration. [NILE] Objection! I have reason to believe that personal feelings play a large part in her testimony. Let the record show that Mikasa Ackerman was orphaned at a young age and was subsequently taken in by the Jaeger family. [NILE] What's more, our own internal [NILE] investigation into this matter led to a most shocking discovery. Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackerman, at the tender age of nine, dealt with three adult [NILE] kidnappers by stabbing all of them to death. [NILE] Granted, this was done in self-defense. [NILE] All the same, one cannot help but question [NILE] the violent nature of the act. [Nile] Knowing all of this, should we really invest in him? [NILE] Money, manpower. Perhaps the very fate of us all? [MAN] Maybe he's a Titan that snuck in here [MAN] after taking the form of some little child he ate? Maybe she's one! I bet she's not human either! [MAN] Yeah, you're right! [MAN] Dissect her too, just to be safe! Now hold on a second! Maybe I'm a monster that you want dead, but you leave her out of this! [EREN] She's innocent! [MAN 1] Like we'd trust you! It's the truth! [MAN 2] She must be one if you protect her! Stop it! [EREN] You're wrong. About it all. [EREN] But you're so intent on pushing selfish agendas, [EREN] you're blind to what's in front of you. Wait. What do you mean? What does it even matter? [EREN] What am I saying? None of you have even seen a Titan, so why're you so afraid, huh? [EREN] Maybe I should just keep quiet. [EREN] No. If they wanna kill me, [EREN] I'll let them know exactly what I think. There's no sense in having power if you're not going to use it to fight! [EREN] If you're too scared to fight for your lives, fine. [EREN] Let me do it! You-- You're all cowards! [MAN] What? Just shut up. And put all your faith in me! Take aim, dammit! Right! Yes, sir! [EREN] Huh? [Eren wheezing] [gasp and growling] Mikasa, wait! [LEVI] You know, personally, [LEVI] I think nothing instills discipline like pain. You don't need a good "talking-to". What you're in need of, boy, is to be taught a lesson. [LEVI] And you happen to be in perfect kicking position. [Eren gasping] N-Now hold on, Levi! What is it? It's dangerous. [NILE] What if he gets angry? Turns into a Titan? Don't be silly. After all, you guys just want to dissect him, don't you? During the time that he was transformed, they say that Jaeger was able to kill twenty Titans before he finally ran out of strength. As an enemy, his intelligence makes him all the more dangerous. [LEVI] But I could still take him down without a problem. [LEVI] How many of you can say the same? [LEVI] Before you torment the beast, you'd better think. [LEVI] Can you actually kill him? [ERWIN] Sir. I have a proposition. Proceed. There's still too much we don't know. And no doubt, his danger will be ever present. As such, I suggest this: [ERWIN] Eren Jaeger will be placed under [ERWIN] Captain Levi's supervision. [ERWIN] And we'll conduct a recon mission [ERWIN] outside of the wall. [ZACHARY] Jaeger will join you in this excursion? [ERWIN] Yes, sir. Then you can [ERWIN] look upon the mission's results yourself. And if he successfully controls his ability... Eren will have proven his value to mankind. Eren Jaeger will be closely supervised? And if he should lose control? [ERWIN] I can definitely kill him, if it comes to that. [ERWIN] The only downside is, [ERWIN] there's absolutely no middle ground. Hm. Then I have made my choice. [HANGE] Well that went better than I expected. Does it hurt? Yeah. Yeah? Describe it to me! Huh? [ERWIN] Sorry for all that. [ERWIN] But the theatrics did get you [ERWIN] placed in our custody. [EREN] No, I understand. [ERWIN] I can assure you the pain was worth it. [ERWIN] We played our trump card at the perfect time. You have my utmost respect. Eren, I'm glad that you're on our team. Uh? Me, too! Glad to be here, sir! So, Eren. [EREN] Sir? You don't resent me now, do you? N-- No. I can see that what you did was necessary, sir. Good. Then you understand. [HANGE] Still, don't you think you went too far? [HANGE] I mean, you knocked his tooth out! Neat, huh? [LEVI] You picked it up? How disgusting. [HANGE] This is a precious sample I'll have you know! Hey, just be glad people like that aren't dissecting you. [HANGE] Don't you dare to compare me with them. [HANGE] I would never even dream of killing him. Hey, Eren. Let me take a look inside that mouth of yours! [HANGE] Your tooth... [HANGE] it grew back. [NARRATOR] After achieving his long-held dream [NARRATOR] of joining the elite Scout Regiment, [NARRATOR] Eren finds the vaunted Scouts are [NARRATOR] an eccentric band of soldiers and searchers. [NARRATOR] A haven for oddballs, misfits and iconoclasts.
