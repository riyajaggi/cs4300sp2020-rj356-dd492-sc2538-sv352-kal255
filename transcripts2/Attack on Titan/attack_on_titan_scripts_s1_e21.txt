 Attack on Titan (2013–…): Season 1, Episode 21 - Iron Hammer: The 57th Expedition Beyond the Walls, Part 5 - full transcript 
 Erwin tells Hange that it was a mistake to think all humans who can transform into Titans are like Eren when the Female has unique abilities that are far beyond a novices, while elsewhere the mole transforms into the Female Titan and chases after Levi's squad. Armin theorizes the mole is someone who had seen Eren transform during the invasion of Trost. Eren wants to transform into his Titan form, but the squad tells him to trust in their skills and keep moving forward. Petra, Erd, and Auruo manage to blind the Female Titan and attempt to cut off her arms and kill her. However, the Female Titan manages to quickly regenerate her right eye and kills Erd, Petra, and Auruo. Seeing his comrades dead, a grieving Eren transforms into his Titan form which gets Mikasa and Levi's attention. Believing his comrades and squad's death could have been avoided if he had transformed in the first place, Eren fights the Female Titan in a long battle. The Female Titan defeats Eren by taking off his head and swallowing Eren. Mikasa attempts to stop the Female Titan but to no avail. She is later joined by Levi who tells her to keep their distance, as the Female Titan is getting tired.

   [ERWIN] It's officially begun. The 57th Recon Mission! [ERWIN] Scouts, move out! [NARRATOR] After setting forth to establish [NARRATOR] a route to Shiganshina, [NARRATOR] the Scout Regiment encountered a Female Titan [NARRATOR] seemingly possessed of sharp, [NARRATOR] cold-hearted intelligence. [ARMIN] We're not dealing with an Abnormal, [ARMIN] this thing's showing intelligence! [ARMIN] It's a human being wrapped in a Titan body! [NARRATOR] As soldier upon soldier fell to this new foe, [NARRATOR] the regiment retreated into [NARRATOR] a forest of massive trees. [NARRATOR] Though to what purpose, [NARRATOR] no one appeared to know. [EREN] If the Levi Squad can't stop this thing, then who can? [EREN] Those men need us! [LEVI] The choice is yours. [LEVI] You can trust yourself, [LEVI] or you can trust the people willing to [LEVI] put their lives on the line for you. I'm with you! Fire! [LEVI] Oh, that's right. [LEVI] While we're on that subject, let me ask. You're okay with me cuttin' your limbs off at the joints, right? [LEVI] I'm mean, they'll grow back? [LEVI] I'm talking about your actual body. [LEVI] Don't want you dead just yet. [LEVI] Timing wouldn't work. [Female Titan roaring] [ERWIN] Think about it. The enemy was prepared [ERWIN] to make sacrifices. Enormous ones. [ERWIN] So committed to maintaining her secret, [ERWIN] she would rather let herself be [ERWIN] cannibalized than exposed. [ERWIN] All hands, withdraw! [ERWIN] Redeploy the formation! [ERWIN] Return to Calaneth District! [HANGE] Erwin. Why bother having him replenish? [HANGE] There's no time. [ERWIN] We saw the Female Titan get eaten. [ERWIN] Did we actually see the person inside [ERWIN] suffer the same fate? I didn't. [gasp] You mean? [ERWIN] Yes. Your hypothesis is correct. This isn't over. We're dealing with someone like Eren. [ERWIN] Someone who regenerates in and out of Titan form. [ERWIN] Suppose that person equipped themselves [ERWIN] with ODM gear in advance. [ERWIN] Suppose further that they're also disguised [ERWIN] in one of our uniforms? [ERWIN] What would their next move be? [GUNTHER] Captain Levi? Wait, that-- That's not-- Oh shit! [EREN] Gunther! [gasp] [ERWIN] How do you ferret out the enemy... [ERWIN] when they're one of your own? [ERWIN] When the Colossal Titan breached the wall [ERWIN] and disappeared, theoretically, whoever was inside had with ODM gear. They would have used it in escape before the steam cleared. It's possible the same thing happened here. I don't see how, sir. Based on Eren's condition when he emerged from Titan form, I think it's safe to assume that something like that is highly unlikely. [HANGE] His equipment was broken. [HANGE] Parts of his uniform were missing. [HANGE] More importantly, Eren was so spent he couldn't even [HANGE] stand on his own two feet without assistance. The Female Titan's ability to summon reinforcements was unlike anything we've encountered before. Our failure to anticipate that factor cost us the operation. [ERWIN] Evidently, there are different levels of mastery [ERWIN] to the Titan ability. [ERWIN] We were naive to think that a mere novice [ERWIN] like Eren would set the standard. If we're to stop this enemy, it's clear now that we'll need to broaden our way of thinking. [JEAN] So if we're goin' home, that means the operation's a success, right? Hopefully so. If that is the case, then that might mean they've already discovered the Female Titan's identity. [JEAN] I wouldn't mind knowin' that myself. [JEAN] Still, I'm impressed with the commander. [JEAN] How'd he know she'd come after us [JEAN] once we took Eren beyond the Wall? [ARMIN] Think about it. During the Trost invasion, [ARMIN] did it strike you as odd the way the Titans [ARMIN] suddenly halted their advance midway through? [JEAN] Huh? They must have intended some purpose when they destroyed the front gate, [ARMIN] but they never made a move on the inner gate. [ARMIN] Nor did they interfere with Eren [ARMIN] when he sealed the breach. [ARMIN] Perhaps, something happened which made them [ARMIN] re-evaluate their plan entirely. And what would that be? Something drew their focus away from the Wall's destruction. Something that forced them to call off the attack. You mean Eren's transformation? [ARMIN] That's the most logical conclusion. Wait, but then that would mean-- It means they were there. [ARMIN] Whoever called off the attack saw Eren transform. [ARMIN] It means the enemy is one of us! Gunther! [ORUO] Go kid! C'mon! Keep moving! [EREN] We-- We're just leaving him? Who is that? [ELD] Keep 'em away from Eren! Damn it! Hey, Eld. What're we doin', huh? There isn't time to get the horses. Make for HQ at full speed! Is that the Female Titan? Or did she have an accomplice? Damn! Whoever it is, they're gonna pay! Even if it's the last thing I do! [EREN] The Female Titan? No. That can't be right! [EREN] I thought we caught her! [ERWIN] We have to consider that if the enemy was still able-bodied when they escaped, then it's entirely possible they can make the Titan reappear as well. [ORUO] I hate being right! No time to lose! Move it! [ELD] She's coming for us! [EREN] Damn you! Not again! I'll kill you! I swear I will! No! Don't! We've got this! The three of us can handle her! You get back to base! Go! Now! [ERWIN] This enemy forces us to rethink [ERWIN] everything we've learned. What seems the most logical strategy might prove to be the worst course of action. Mark my words. The time will come when risking everything is the only choice left to us. [EREN] I can fight her, too! [ELD] Just go! This is our best course of action! We can not afford to put you at risk! Have you learned nothing? After all this, you still doubt our skills? Is that true, Eren? I thought you had faith in us. That you trusted us! And unless we can take that risk, humanity can never win. [EREN] I have faith in the Levi Squad! [EREN] Good luck! [warcry] [gasp] [ELD] We've blinded her! That should give us at least [ELD] a minute before she can regenerate! [PETRA] We'll finish her well before then! [ORUO] To hell with capturing you! [ELD] We're gonna kill you! [PETRA] We're gonna carve you up! [ORUO] We'll make you pay, bitch! [ELD] Covering your neck isn't gonna save you! [ELD] We'll just keep slicing those shoulders [ELD] 'til your arms are worthless. T[ELD] rust me, we know what we're doing. No mercy! [PETRA] We'll cut you to ribbons! [ORUO] Lop off your arms! [ELD] Send you to hell! [ORUO] They're down! Now go for the neck! [ORUO] Take out the muscles supporting her head! Let's chop our way to the nape! [EREN] They-- They've got her totally overwhelmed! [EREN] They're so good. They pulled off [EREN] a coordinated attack without even saying a word! [EREN] It must be the trust they have [EREN] in each other as teammates. [EREN] That's how they've survived this long. [EREN] It's how they're able to stay strong [EREN] even after losing Gunther. [EREN] Gotta keep going! [EREN] I have to have faith that the right choice [EREN] is to keep moving without looking back! [EREN] I've got to trust in them. I understand that, now! [LEVI] Truth is, I don't know which is better. I never have. Should I go out on my own? Or should I put myself in the hands of my comrades? Either way, there's no guarantee. [gasp] [ELD] Say goodbye to your nape--! [PETRA] Eld! How? She can see again? That's impossible! [PETRA] It hasn't even been thirty seconds. Only one eye? She channeled her energy into one eye [PETRA] to grow it back quicker? How can she do that? [ORUO] Petra! Pull yourself together! [ORUO] Petra! [Petra screaming] [screaming] Now... die! What the hell? My blades weren't able to-- ♪ [EREN] I'm gonna... I'm gonna... kill you! [roaring] That's Eren! Hang on a second! Mikasa! [LEVI] That roaring. This isn't good. [Eren Titan roar] [Eren Titan roaring] [Eren Titan roar] [Eren Titan panting] [Erenn Titan growling] [distant Titan fighting] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Eren Titan growl] [roar] [EREN TITAN] I made the wrong decision when you came after us. [EREN TITAN] I made the choice to trust my teammates. [EREN TITAN] And it got them all killed! [howling] [EREN TITAN] I should never have left it to them. [EREN TITAN] I should have fought her from the very start! [EREN TITAN] I-It's all my fault. [EREN TITAN] I should have killed her! [roaring] [EREN TITAN] I should've-- [EREN TITAN] I should've changed into a Titan then. [EREN TITAN] No. Even earlier than that. [EREN TITAN] I should've fought back! [EREN TITAN] And with Captain Levi there. [EREN TITAN] We would've beaten her. [EREN TITAN] We could've captured this monster! [LEVI] I wouldn't blame you. [LEVI] Do as your conscience dictates. [EREN TITAN] It was-- It was my choice. [EREN TITAN] And because of that choice, [EREN TITAN] my squad-mates are dead. [EREN TITAN] All of them, gone. And I'm to blame. [EREN TITAN] No. More than anything, this is your fault! [growling] [EREN TITAN] I'm going to rip you to shreds. [EREN TITAN] Once my hands heal. [EREN TITAN] I'll tear you apart. Piece by piece. [EREN TITAN] Then I'll devour you! [roar] [Eren Titan heavy breathing] [Female Titan sigh] [worried breaths] [EREN] A-- ♪ Eren, no! [MIKASA] N-No. Wait, I-- Eren. [gasp] Please, you can't leave me. Give him back. [MIKASA] Do you hear me? Give him back! [Mikasa warcry] Give him back! [Mikasa power yell] [MIKASA] My blades didn't even break the skin. He's still alive. He's still alive. And I'm coming for him. Just hang on, Eren! [MIKASA] I know you're in there. And after I kill her, I'll carve out her insides, and pull you out again. I swear I will. Just hang on a little longer. Don't give up, Eren. Never give up! Get back here! [MIKASA] What? We'll stay back for now. Maintain current distance. [LEVI] She's slowed down a bit. [LEVI] That fight wore her out, too. It looked like she may have bitten the entire nape off. It's unlikely Eren survived. [NARRATOR] "He's still alive. Give him back." [NARRATOR] After watching helplessly [NARRATOR] as Eren was taken away, [NARRATOR] Mikasa fights alongside Levi, [NARRATOR] humanity's greatest soldier, [NARRATOR] in a battle against the Female Titan.
