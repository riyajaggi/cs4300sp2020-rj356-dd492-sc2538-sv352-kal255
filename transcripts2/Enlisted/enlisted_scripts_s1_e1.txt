Yeah, well, it felt like you didn't need us, you dick. You know, I mean, we're all we've got, so... Okay, this is way too heavy for randy to hear, but, uh... You want to know how much I needed you guys? You see these? I put these on here. And whenever I felt like I wasn't gonna make it, I'd look at them. So you guys would be the last thing that I see.
