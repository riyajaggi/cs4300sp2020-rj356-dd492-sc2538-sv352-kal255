 What did Kingsley say? I'm seeing him again this afternoon. What does that mean for me? I always figured you for more than an errand boy. They'll wait for him to be sworn in and then they'll come for you. You give us your contact who supplied the arms. KMPH is selling service contracts to its rival, Seracom. - Seracom paid Miller's ransom, right? - Right. Unpack those boxes. This isn't over. Sir, sir. Colonel Russell, how many have we lost? Twenty-two.

 - Jesus. - This is just the beginning. Now these guys have something to shoot at, it's gonna get a whole lot worse. Al Moctar? Fled before the battle. - What about Clarke and Toumi? - You were right. He was protecting them. Gave them a vehicle. Last seen, they were headed southwest. Thank you. Hey, man, thanks. Brandon? What are you doing here? Miller sent me. Since when do you report to him? He didn't tell you I was coming? Wait here. - Are you shutting me out? - I thought you could - use the support. - He's Agency, Nate. You go through me. Should I be worried? Amanda, I'm just trying to help you out. Don't get paranoid on me. I got to go. ♪ We tell ourselves ♪ ♪ We're on the side of the angels ♪ ♪ And we tell ourselves ♪ ♪ We're the good guys ♪ ♪ But we know ♪ ♪ Our heads are in the sand ♪ ♪ We know ♪ ♪ Nothing ever changes ♪ ♪ The same people win ♪ ♪ The same people lose ♪ ♪ We know the fight is fixed ♪ ♪ The wars go on and on ♪ ♪ And we know. ♪ You don't have to do this, you know. What? Hitch your wagon to mine, hurtling toward the precipice. Don't be so dramatic. I hear Senator Garcia is hiring. Will you stop? Why are KMPH dumping assets? They just won a whole bunch of military contracts, now they're selling them to Seracom? Maybe the two companies are connected. 2003, KMPH won a whole bunch of no-bid contracts in Iraq. Hospitals, water plants, oil infrastructure. Man on the ground in Baghdad was William Kingsley. Wait. Um... um... Nathan Miller was a case officer in Baghdad, same time. You think they met? Possible. 2006, the Feds investigated KMPH over the Iraq contracts. Ah, nothing came of it. The lawyer who represented them was Nicole Auster. Auster was her maiden name. She married... Nathan Miller. You got everything? Daddy, you already asked me that, like, a thousand times. - You got everything? - You got everything? You're being so annoying right now. - Hey, sweetie. - We watched Charlie Chaplin. The Kid. I bet her five dollars that she couldn't sit through a silent movie. - She cried. - I did not. - Yes, you did. You cried. - Maybe I did. Hey, it's good you're running bets, I like that. Some things never change. I love you. I love you, too, Daddy. There you go. - Thanks. - Mm. - Oh, her, uh, school bag. - Oh. Uh, we finished her homework. Look at you, Mr. Organized. - Yeah. - Hey. You never did her homework. - That's not true. - Um... Okay, yeah. Yeah, that's... that is true. You're so like her. She's like you, I don't know. Yeah. Hey, what if, um... What if I got out? If I retired? - Nate. - Nic, I don't want to be a weekend dad. I don't. I want to come home. Look, I know that I need to do better. I know that. I'm not asking you for an answer right now. I'm just asking for your permission to try. I need some time, Nate. But you're not saying no? - No. - You are, you're saying no. No. No, I'm not saying no. Ah. No, you're not saying no. Yeah. I'm gonna shut up now. This is me shutting up. Shutting it. Where are we going? I'm gonna find the contact. Look, you don't have to come with me. Either of you. I can get you across the border, you'll be safe, but... I'm-I'm doing this. Somewhere down there is Al Moctar's contact? Yeah. How will you find him? I've got a number. Give it a call, see who answers. Except you're too far away to see anything. Are you gonna help? I'm still here, aren't I? I'll do it. I can get closer. What? It's not like you two can blend in. As-salaam alaikum. That's him there, in the compound. He's got security. How do we get to him? Thank you. Meaghan. Hello, Aaron. How's Karen? Missing those day trips with her godmother, but her godmother's a workaholic, so... Well, you should've thought of that before you asked me to beher godmother. How can I help? You know I'm retiring - next month? - I'm not asking you to prosecute. Just need an opinion. You're familiar with Nicole Miller? Mm, crossed paths. Thought she quit practicing to run her NGO. She did. Her client list included a company called KMPH. - I know them. - The SEC hit them with a subpoena in 2004 under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. They were paying off Iraqi officials to procure contracts. Except it never went to court. KMPH attorneys shrugged the lawsuit, claiming they were, uh, grease payments, not bribes. - Nicole Miller represented them? - Not that time. Conflict of interest. Her firm were caught red-handed setting up a shell company to route bribe money. Miller was implicated as a defendant. - Ouch. Still, they managed to keep it out of court. - So... what if I brought a new lawsuit? I'm scratching my head why you're so worked up over a mid-ranking ex D.C. lawyer and a bunch of Baghdadi bribes from ancient history. You run out of fights to pick? Trust me, this one's worth it. Everyone was paying kickbacks in the post-Iraq gold rush. Even so, the technicality KMPH used to dodge the subpoena was bogus. An offshore shell company with Iraqi officials as direct beneficiaries predating any business transaction? There's no way that qualifies as grease payments. Right, just-just go with me here. If you were to prosecute this case, where'd that leave Nicole Miller? In the dock, sweating bullets, guilty as sin. So I have a case? She'd do time? I'd say you want her, you got her. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Drive. Who the fuck are you? Fucking drive! Keep your hands on the wheel. Okay, check in the back. See if there's any rope or cables or something. Will this do? Yeah, perfect. You're making a huge mistake, bro. Huge. Aicha, you wait here. Is this about cutting off Al Moctar? You're with the translator. - I figured... - Move. It's nothing to do with me, mate. I'm just a grunt following orders. Yeah, whose orders? Who were you getting the arms from? Now, why did you have to go and ask a silly question like that? Fuck me. Sit. You're doing this all wrong. Hmm? How's that? You should put a nail in me first and then ask questions. Shortens the process. Then we don't have to stretch out this whole, "I'm not going to talk, you're gonna make me talk" torture bullshit thing. Just get it over with. It's worth a fucking try. Put down your fucking gun! Or boyfriend Clyde here is going to get a nail in his fucking head! - Drop it! - Okay. Okay. Now how we supposed to fucking talk to him? Senator. This way, please. Here. Thank you for seeing me, Ms. Miller. Nicole, please. Take a seat. Burkina Faso. We've been creating protected water basins, reducing the number of infant deaths from waterborne diseases by as much as 40%. Impressive. Thank you. Why did you quit law? Oh. I see you've been doing your research. Just curious. No, I wasn't satisfied. I wanted to do - something more... - Worthwhile? Right. Well, I-I wanted to try, at least. Does it ease the conscience? I'm sorry, Senator. I assumed you were here to lend us your support. I'm here about Tikrit. Excuse me? Akram Muhssan. The district governor you bought out there. The deal you cut. We were building a hospital. Basra. Karbala. Lot of deals. Lot of bribes. And they all seem to have one common denominator. You. Do I need to call my attorney? You should know. - Hey. - Hey. - Thanks for coming. - Course. - You okay? - Yeah. Uh, no. Do you know Senator Meaghan Sullivan? Um, I-I'm sorry. - When you asked me to come over, I... - Nate. - Do you know her? - Yes, I know her. - Yes, I've come across her. - Recently? Yes, I... Why? Wh-What... Why is this so important? She came in to see me today. She wanted to talk about Iraq. Look at me. Tell me exactly what she said to you. Senator Sullivan just threatened my wife. Maybe we should talk about this in person. Hey. Everything all right? Jessica popped by. She left you this. Did you tell her about the complaint? Of course not. Then why was she so concerned about me? She knew something was up is all. She let it slip. You're still working on it. What-Whatever it was that threatened my career... You are still working on it. - You lied. - I didn't lie. Oh, okay, so, you didn't tell me the truth. You told me not to cave. You told me not to back down. You put my career first, for once. Is that what this is about? Fuck you, Meg! Don't you dare patronize me. How do you know they won't come after me again? - They won't. - How do you know? You don't. Look, I should've told you. I'm-I'm sorry. Did you ever stop? Of course I did! How can you ask me that? Honey... You know, you could have said thank you. Or did you just forget that he had a gun to your head? Yeah, you're right. Thank you. I know you didn't have to come with me. Yeah, I did. Hey. Look. Musa. That was Al Moctar's code name for the shipments. "Pierre Falcon. Meet him. "Pier 2. 9:00 p.m. Koulikoro." Koulikoro's a port on the Niger, just downstream from Bamako. That's probably where the weapons came in. Yeah. Pierre Falcon? Name of his contact. I'm not getting anything on him. So let's go down there and take a look. Hey, I mean it. Thank you. For not leaving you alone to die out here in the dirt? - Yeah. - Say it. Really? Yeah. For not leaving me alone to die out here. In the dirt. In the dirt. You're not forgiven. Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Weaver. Show him in. You hungry? Um, no, sir. Cornflakes at night. My mother used to give it to me and my brother when I was a kid. I don't know why. Cheap, I guess. Never broke the habit. Senator Sullivan, sir... Family. You don't go near that. No. No, you do not. And you want my help. I do. She's a senator, sir. Amanda Jones. She didn't find Clarke and Toumi yet? No. Not yet. This tape is gonna cost us an awful lot of money. We're stripping assets. We're taking a hit. Kingsley. I know the man. He won't sing. I can't say the same for Amanda Jones. Can you? Well, I know that she believes in this... If we need her to take a fall for us... will you stake your life upon her silence? You want me to help you. More than happy to do that. But I want you to take care of Jones. We need her, sir. What we need is someone at Langley. We had you. We had her. We'll find someone else. What's the name of her second-in-command? Brandon Napier. Didn't you just send him over there? You think I'm not informed, son? Why did you send him? Because she needed help. Really? That's it? Not because, somewhere in the back of your mind, you knew you might need someone else to take the reins? Excuse me. I need to take this. - Go ahead. - Dan? They got my delivery boy, Nate. Slow down. Who are we talking about? Clarke and Toumi. They took out Morten Nielsen a few hours ago. He was my bridge to Al Moctar. Well, that's inconvenient. It's a little more than inconvenient. His body was found outside of Dianke. I thought you should know. I appreciate it, Dan. Yeah. I, uh... I need to go call Amanda Jones. Do it here, son. What? You do the call here, Nathan. Yes, sir. Hey. Hey, it's me. I just got a call from Dan Lotz. Clarke and Toumi are in Dianke. Or they were, as of two hours ago. Th... Hello? Hello? Yeah. Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm-I'm here. They got to one of his, uh... h-his guys. Morten Nielsen. Did they get anything from him? I don't know. Well, can you ask Lotz? You're the one on the ground, Amanda. - Okay. I'll ask him. - Whatever he gave them, that's where they'll go next. Nate. Kingsley? The tape? I'm still working on it. Christ, Nate! Do not brush me off. I-I'm not doing anything else until you tell me what the fuck is going on over there. I-I went to Hal Weaver. You did what? He cut a deal with Kingsley, insurance, if the, uh... - if the tape comes out. - Which is? That he'll stand down and... if there is an investigation... he'll take the fall for it. Maybe he does some time. But, uh, he'll be looked after. They're offering the same thing to you, Amanda. You'd be done at the Agency. Jesus. They'll find you a-a... a-a job on the... on the board of one of these Fortune 500s. Seven figures. You and Evie won't worry about a thing. I'm sorry, Amanda. Yeah, well... I'm sure you did your best. The deal is contingent upon you finding Clarke and Toumi. And if I don't? Then it gets complicated. Napier's in position, right? Mali's a dangerous place. I want the order to come from you, Nate. Shit. Evening. Do you, uh... do you speak English? Engine off. - Papers. - Uh, we're working on the highway up at Bamba. We left our papers in the trailer. - Where are you going? - Uh, Bamako. Got to pick up some, uh, radios, phones, batteries. What is your name? What... Tell me your name. What is your name? Hey, um, for your trouble. Out. I didn't mean to offend you. Get out of the truck now! Okay, I'm getting out. I'm getting out. Americans are looking for you, my friend. Hands where I can see them. - You too. - Okay, easy. Easy. I'm complying. - I'm complying. - Tahirou. Tahirou, get out... Tahirou, get out here now! Tahirou! Get out here now! - Put the gun down. - Who are you?! Put it down! Listen to her. Where you from? What? Answer me. Where are you from? Bamako. Sokoni. Missira. We're practically neighbors. I have a brother and sister there. Just kids. You have any brothers? Sisters? Yes, he does. How many? How old? Just one. She's seven. Maybe they know each other. I want to see them again. Don't you want to see your sister again? I don't want to die here. Do you? No one here wants to die over this. Not today. Right. Down. On the ground. The other one. Step aside. Wow. Get you. I don't even know how to shoot. Evening, Senator. You're a long way from your neighborhood. Home doesn't have quite the same welcoming feel as it used to. Nothing to do with me, I hope. Who was she? The student who made the complaint. I mean, uh... how do you find these people? Pretty low... - coming after my family. - Says the woman - threatening to send my wife to jail. - Difference is she's guilty. Well, I guess we're both dedicated to our cause. And what is your cause, Mr. Miller? Same as yours, Senator. - America. - Except I serve the American people. Who do you serve... beyond yourself? I put my life... on the line for this country. Can you say the same? "Serving the American people." That's the most overused phrase in the history of the republic. What does that even fucking mean, Senator? Seems like you've lost faith in our democratic process. I've lost faith in a lot of things. But you haven't lost faith in William Kingsley. Do you think he should run America? The government outsourced the security of this country to make their boardroom friends a few billion dollars. You're a mercenary, Mr. Miller. Nothing more. Okay, let me tell you something, Senator. I've seen bureaucrats here in D.C. protect their turf at the expense of men and women on the battlefield. I've seen towers come down because of inflated egos and agency rivalries. I've seen friends die... Good people... Because of the slow-footed incompetence of politicians who are only interested in hanging on to their fucking careers. So, yes, I'll work for whoever gets the job done. There are other ways of doing it. Who's to say that your way is better than mine? Who paid your ransom? I want names, details. How the whole thing works. Everything you have on the deep state. There is no deep state, Senator. Just a bunch of old white guys clinging to power, doing everything they can to protect their interests before they become extinct. They will be held to account, Mr. Miller, by our Congress, by our press, if not by our spineless government, and you are going to help me do that. Knowing me like you do, you really think - that that's gonna happen? - If you don't want little Katie spending her 12th birthday visiting her mom in prison... yeah, actually, I do. I'm gonna go to bed. You sleep well, Senator. Nate? Amanda Jones. Consider it done. And I will put your wife beyond reach. Mm. - Yeah? - Adam. Amanda Jones. An unexpected pleasure. I can't hear you. Hold on, I'm just moving. Are you sober? Well... depends what for. Do you want another crack at Clarke and Toumi? You're a fucking beautiful woman, did I ever tell you that? They should be in room six. Are they here? Yes, of course. Come. Come, come, come. Oh, I missed you. I missed you. I missed you. Thank you, for bringing them here. You're welcome. And where did you find the body? One of my men found him - in an old mining hut in Dianke. - Fuck. What did this guy do for you? He was my main contact for shipment. And what did Morten know, exactly? Well, he knew everything. Okay. Thank you. If Morten spilled, Clarke and Toumi will be on to Pierre Falcon. They'll be heading for the port. So we get a jump on them. I want to use McKay. Keep it low-profile. Stay here. Until we call you. I'll do that. Thank you. Both of you. - We're not out of it yet. - Oh... can't you accept just a little bit of gratitude? He can't, no. It's one of his many gifts. I'm not supposed to be talking to you. Sir, I... Don't call me that. You don't work for me anymore. Hell... you don't even work for them. Did Miller tell you that? Miller didn't tell me a goddamn thing. Miller didn't talk to you? He told you he was coming to see me, didn't he? He went straight to Hal, right over my head. I almost admire the bastard. They will fuck you, Amanda. Don't you be under any illusion about that one. - Hey. - Hey. You want to come in? No. No, I've got to... I got to get some sleep. Okay. I just want you to know that you don't have to worry about Sullivan. You could've called. Yeah. I could have. She's okay, right? Sullivan? She's fine. What did you think I would do to her, Nic? Sorry, it's-it's been a long day. I... Thank you. I've got your back. Always. And that's why he's known as the king of the outfield. Bottom of the fourth, one ball... - he's having problems with his pitching elbow... There we go, Aaron. - Thanks. See you tomorrow. - Here's the windup. Foul ball. What's going on? I'm going to stay at my sister's. We can talk about this. You know, I don't even mind that everything about you comes before everything about me. I got used to that. I got used to that a long time ago. I got used to your crusades and the price that I have to pay for them. But then you lie to me? And then I start thinking that maybe you've lied about other things. Oh, God, I'm sor... No. Don't. How's Tessa? Small talk? Not really your style. Anything? No. Nothing. Right, there's pier two. Maybe Pierre Falcon has an office in there. Pierre Falcon. It's a ship, not a person. And that's how they bring the arms in. Well, there's no way we're getting on that thing. They're here. Leyla, it's here. Pierre Falcon. Leased by a company called Ecomaritime. Oh, shit. Go. Fucking Christ. This way. Brandon. Colonel Russell, it's Amanda Jones. Clarke and Toumi are on their way to a company called Ecomaritime. I'm sending you the address now. I'll send a team. I'll meet you there. This is it. Clean energy. - Solar panels, wind farms... - Desalination plants, water purification kits. It's a perfect cover if you want to ship arms. There has to be a link to KMPH in here. Wheels up in five minutes. Take me off the manifest. No one... knows I am on this flight. Harry. I've seen this man. Moussa Diarra. CEO. No, the man with him. Two years ago, after we came back from Mali, George White and I went to see Yambo Kanté, the puppet they installed as president... he was there. Who is he? No idea. Shit. Let's go. Don't you fucking move! Hands in the air! Hands where I can see 'em! Get on the fucking floor! Do not move! Captioned by Media Access Group at WGBH
