 It's not the CIA that's supplying the arms, - it's a corporation. - This is about the wars we're gonna be fighting in ten, 20 years' time. Do you have any idea how much that's worth? So we find a link between KMPH and Al Moctar. A lot of deals... A lot of bribes. And they all seem to have one common denominator: you. I'd say you want her, you got her. Senator Sullivan just threatened my wife!

 - Pretty low, coming after my family! - Says the woman threatening to send my wife to jail. Who paid your ransom? I want names! Details! Everything you have on the Deep State. - I went to Hal Weaver. - You did what? He cut a deal with Kingsley... They're offering the same thing to you, Amanda. You'd be done at the Agency. Brandon? I want the order to come from you, Nate. Amanda Jones... Consider it done. There is no Deep State, Senator. Just a bunch of old white guys clinging to power.

 Doing everything they can to protect their interests before they become extinct. Okay, pick it up. Pull the big one! That was amazing. You're in goal now. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Come on, go! - Oh! - Yay! - That was pretty good. - Oh, Daddy... Yeah... hello? - So they have him. - Who? Harry Clarke. Our military picked him up in Bamako. Why do I get the distinct feeling this is news to you? - Um... uh, no, uh... - Get over here. This is Brandon Napier. Please leave a message. I'll get back to you. Brandon, it's Nate. You want to tell me what the fuck is going on? This is Amanda Jones. Please leave me a message. You came back. Come here. I'm so sorry! It's okay. I love... Did I wake you? It's 4:00 in the morning, what do you think? We're coming to you live from Washington, where federal prosecutor Aaron Roth was killed tonight. Sources within the police department are saying it was a mugging gone horribly wrong. ...around 10:00 p.m. last night. Meaghan? Meaghan, are you there? This is Amanda Jones. Please leave me a message. Thank you. Why are you thanking her? You should be thanking me. Still breathing, aren't you? Tell me you know where they've taken Harry Clarke. I don't. What about Napier? - I can't get ahold of him. - Do you think, at this crucial moment, he's decided to make himself unavailable? No, sir. No. Then his silence does not bode well for us, does it, Nate? - No, it does not. - No. And what about Jones? Let me take a wild guess here. You have no idea where she is. I do not. Well, ain't this just a fucking day? Now you understand one thing here, Nathan. You're not dealing with Kingsley anymore. I don't have his... how shall I put it? ...restraint. You don't fix this, I'm gonna take this fork, and I'm gonna stick it in your fucking eyeballs myself. Pass the salt. Now fuck off. ♪ We tell ourselves ♪ ♪ We're on the side of the angels ♪ ♪ And we tell ourselves ♪ ♪ We're the good guys ♪ ♪ But we know ♪ ♪ Our heads are in the sand ♪ ♪ We know ♪ ♪ Nothing ever changes ♪ ♪ The same people win ♪ ♪ The same people lose ♪ ♪ We know the fight is fixed ♪ ♪ The wars go on and on ♪ ♪ And we know. ♪ Leyla? Are you okay? What happened? I'd kill for some water. Thank you. - Where's Harry? - They have him. I'm so sorry. There were soldiers everywhere. I took a different turn. I shouldn't have left him. Do you know this man? It's Dan Lotz. South African businessman. He's long been suspected of dealing in illegal arms, but nothing's ever been proven. I think he's supplying Al Moctar. We connect him to KMPH, we have a link. You sound like Harry. Wouldn't he love that? We find the link, we have leverage. Maybe we get him released. Gina? Sorry. Only me. Have you heard from her? No. His daughter's graduating this year. It's okay. It's not okay, Jess. One thing it's fucking not, and that is okay. Hey. Hey, listen to me. Okay? You're not gonna let these fuckers win. You hear what I said? Now go get dressed. - Amanda. - Thank you for agreeing to meet with me. Nathan Miller's office. Colonel Russell on the line. Colonel. What's the latest on Leyla Toumi? We're still out there looking. Well, you may want to get eyes on Aminata Sissoko. My bet is she's helping Toumi. Thank you, we'll do that. Uh, did-did your boys oversee Clarke's transport? We escorted him to the airport. That's it. Well, I'm-I'm trying to find the flight manifest here. Uh, they-they took him to, um... You better ask Amanda Jones that one, because she didn't tell me. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, I'll just... I'll just do that. Thank you. Get me Brigadier General Ramirez. Carlos. How's Christine? Listen, I am, uh, I am trying to track down a detainee by the name of, uh, of Harry Clarke. He was picked up in Bamako, Mali last night by a platoon from 75th. Nothing. Huh. Of course, Eric. No, I c... I-I totally understand. No, I appreciate it. Of course. Yeah. Not a problem. Bye-bye. I-I mean, I've-I've asked-I've asked, uh, eight... eight fucking people this question. If there is anything... anything that you can find out for me, Cole, that would be dinner on me at the Oak Room. Listen, I have to go. I appreciate your time. - Is he in there? - Ma'am, you can't just go in there. Karen Roth. Aaron Roth's daughter. It's okay, Sienna, I got this. When he asked me to be her godmother, I said no. I was too busy. I thought I'd be a terrible godmother. But he kept asking. That was Aaron. - Nothing if not persistent. - Senator, I'm sorry for your loss, but this has nothing to do with me. How do you lie so easily? Again, Senator, I am very sorry for your loss, but this has nothing to do with me. You're a fucking monster, Mr. Miller. And I know you know it. I'm hungry. What are you hungry for? I don't know. You know what I'm hungry for? Beghrir. - You know what that is? - No. They're little pancakes. My dad... used to make them for me when I was little. I loved them so much. Dan Lotz's company records, tax returns. Most of them aren't digitized, I'm afraid. Okay... Okay, we're in for a long day. So-so Harry Clarke hasn't popped up on your radar? Is there nothing that you can give me, man? Nothing, Oliver? Come on, man. A plane has to land. It doesn't just fucking disappear. Okay. All right, that's fine. No, I... I-I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you very... Thank you. Fuck! Fuck! - Nic? - Katie has a fever. - They sent her home. - Is she okay? Yeah, no, I think she's gonna be fine. Thing is, I have the board at 11:00. - Uh, did you try Maria? - No, I tried Maria, I tried Natasha, Kirsten... I've tried everybody. It's an hour. Two, tops. Uh, Nic, I'm-I'm really very sorry. I-I have a-a lot going on today. Well, I thought you didn't want to be a weekend dad. I'm asking you to take care of your daughter for a couple of hours. Shouldn't be so hard. Okay. How was the flight? Comfortable? Long, right? Can we get you anything? Water? Soda? Coffee? Cigarette? I want to speak to Amanda Jones. - Hey. - Hey. Is she okay? Yeah, she's sleeping. I'll see if I can hurry them along. - Good luck. - Thank you. Okay, we know Seracom paid Miller's ransom, but we don't know why. Seracom bought the Mali contracts from KMPH. But that's the only link we have between them. Which gives us absolutely nothing. I'm aware of that, thank you. Hi. I need some papers. Uh, Jess, could you give us a moment? Yeah, of course. I'm not staying. No. I heard about Aaron. Sorry. I know that you two were close. Let me help. Was it you? Aaron's death? I know that you went to see him. Was it... was it this? I figured they'd come after me. Yeah, what wouldn't they do? But you still can't leave it alone, can you? Even now. Especially now. I'm trying to do the right thing, Gina. Yeah, and it blinds you until you end up hurting everyone around you. - Everyone? - Okay. Me. Shouldn't that be enough? Yeah. Senator Sullivan, this is Amanda Jones. This whole "meeting in parking structures..." it's in the CIA handbook, right? I like to control my environment. And how's that working out for you? - Meaning? - Meaning you're clearly on the back foot or you wouldn't be hiding down here. The interpreter was the target... because she knew who paid Miller's ransom. That's why you had her silenced. Am I warm? I'm not gonna answer that question, Senator. - Then what the fuck am I doing here? - Because I'm gonna give you someone who will. We know you were involved in the attack on the bar. We know that you were working with Al Moctar. Who did you report to? Straight to Al Moctar? You and Toumi must have been quite a catch for him. Two former intelligence officers. You turned on your own people, Harry. - Did you convert? - Where is she? Where is Leyla Toumi? Amanda Jones. You can keep up with this Amanda Jones shit all day. For the 14th fucking time, she is not available. So either you talk to us, or... Amanda Jones. Okay. How's she doing? She's good. She didn't wake up once. You're a lifesaver. How did it go? Oh, yeah. We got our final slice of funding. Should see us through the next six months. Congratulations. Yeah. Well, um... - Cole. - Hartwood. That is un-fucking-believable news, man. Thank you. Thank you so much. I know where Clarke is. - Where is he? - He's at a black site outside Hartwood. Well, get inside and pick him up. It's an Agency site, sir. I can't just waltz in there. You've got contacts inside Langley. I did. Amanda Jones and Brandon Napier. Jones is running, but she won't run without one thing. What's that? Her daughter. Get him up. Let's go, come on. I've asked you all the questions that I'm gonna ask you. You choose to answer them at any point during this, I will stop. - Understood? - Amanda Jones. Have it your way. "Enhanced interrogation," what a crock of shit. You're drowning, right? Answer our questions, Clarke, and we will stop. Amanda Jones. Okay. Okay, everyone, time for cake. Mommy, Mommy! Oh, sweetie. Come on, we got to go. - But we haven't had cake yet. - Okay. Amanda. What are you doing here? I had some downtime. I flew in this morning. Didn't think to call? It was last-minute. I thought I would take Evie out for a bite to eat. Okay, well, it's her sister's party. Half sister. Yeah. Forgot how petty you were. - Come on, we're going. - No. She's not. She can go when the party's over. You're welcome to stay. I do not have time for this. Shit. What is he doing here? I... I'm gonna need a minute alone, please. Sweetie, you go with Daddy. I'll be a moment, okay? - Nate. - Ed. Nice party. I can see why you'd come back for it. - I was gonna tell you... - I understand. Family first. Always. Shall we go? Where? Hartwood. You're going to get Harry Clarke for me. I mean, that is... why you are here, isn't it? Of course. Unless you would like to... stay for cake? No. No, I'm good. Okay. Then let's go. Can I say goodbye to Evie first? Of course you can, Amanda. You want to take my car? No, that's okay. We'll take mine. It's right up here. How's this gonna work for me once the tape comes out? It's everything I promised. The deal will kick in. We'll take care of you, Amanda. I made sure of that. I'll bring him out. Paperwork should take about ten minutes. Hey, I'm here to get Harry Clarke. ID. Fingers. You're clear. Get him down from there. Did you hear me? Get him down from there! That didn't come from me. The waterboarding... I didn't order it. But you ordered me dead in Tehran, right? Is that why you wanted to see me... to dredge up the past? In Tehran, you were a threat. I decided - to have you removed. - But I'm still a threat, so why spare me now? Who said I was sparing you? Why didn't you get on that plane in Mali? You were free. Yeah, well, maybe if I had that moment again, I wouldn't play it the same way. Yes, you would. I heard you at Sissoko's house. You believe in the power of truth. You're an idealist. - Am I? - Haven't you heard? Truth isn't truth anymore. You can pick any version of it you want. - Yeah, that's how you justify what you do. - Yes, it is. That is how I live with myself. You're absolutely fucking right about that. You didn't talk. You had your chance. You didn't talk about me, about Kingsley, about any of it. Why? Leyla. She's still out there. You're gonna call off your dogs, you're gonna let her go. That's your price? It is. Doing a deal. Just like your father... saving your skin. Not mine. Hers. No deal, I'm afraid. - What? - Go on. Get up. Now. Jones, listen to me. Please. Get up. Put it on. Come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Signing out Harry Clarke. Okay. I left something. I'll be right back. Fuck are you going? Can I help you, sir? Sir, get back in the car. Yeah, I will in a second. Get back in the car, sir. Gonna have to ask you to show me your hands, sir. Sir? Show me your hands! Go back down the tunnel. You'll see a set of stairs. Take them to the rear exit. Take a left. Head due south for about five minutes. Run. That's him. That's got to be Clarke. All right, let's go. Go get him. We got him. We got him. We've got you, man, we got you. Clear! Go! Get inside! Upstairs! Fletcher here. Go ahead, Fletch. Tell Colonel Russell we have eyes on Aminata Sissoko. Hey. - Hey, Amanda. - Natalie, thank you so much for doing this. Yeah, yeah, no problem at all. Evie, your mommy's here. Do you want to come in? - Another time. - Okay. Thank you. Hey, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Thank you. Where are we going? Here, look at this. Dan Lotz founded a company importing solar panels three weeks after we left Mali. Do you think that's how he was bringing in the arms? There's a silent partner here. Funded the start-up costs. Lila Lotz. Well, that's got to be a relation. His granddaughter. - 12 years old. - Wow. That's a little bit young for an investor. Wait, I saw something... in his tax returns. He set up a trust for her education. Already made a down payment for... the fees for a school in Washington, D.C.... Georgetown International. Ooh, very fancy. Set up ten years ago with an endowment from a charity called American United Resources. Which is a charitable arm of Kingsley, Merchant, Proctor and Hall... KMPH. We have our link. Get down! Get down! - I'm complying. I'm complying! - Hands where I can see them! I'm gonna answer this, okay? - Ma'am, I will shoot you. - It's just... - it's just my phone! - Do not move! - Do not fucking move! - I'm complying, it's just my phone! I need to answer this, I'm gonna answer my phone, I'm gonna fucking answer my phone! It's a phone, okay? It's just a fucking phone! - Do not fucking move! I will shoot you! - It's just a phone! Leyla. Leyla! Hello? This is Senator Meghan Sullivan of the United States Congress. Who am I speaking to? Hello? This is Colonel John Russell, 75th - Ranger Regiment. - Colonel. I need you to listen to me very carefully. Come on, kiddo. Natalia. Amanda. This way. My name is Amanda Jones. I work for the CIA. And I wish to apply for political asylum to the Russian government. I thought I lost you. Plenty of time for that later. Right now I think we need to talk. It's Senator Sullivan. I'm alone. Were you expecting someone else? I bet you're wondering why you haven't been picked up. I know what you were doing in Mali two years ago, Mr. Miller. I know why Seracom paid your ransom, and I know how and why KMPH armed Issouf Al Moctar. What you're going to do for me is fill in the missing pieces. How it works here in D.C.... you're going to bring the whole damn thing crashing down. And in return, the Feds are going to offer you a deal. You'll do time, but not as much as you deserve. I'm being reinstated to the Intelligence Committee. Turns out facts still hold some sway in this town. First thing I'm gonna do is hold open hearings. You will be subpoenaed. It's over, Mr. Miller. There's no shame. Everybody flips in the end. What did she offer you... immunity? You think I'm not having you watched? And I know you're calling me now to see what I can offer you. You're playing me off against her. You're my most valuable player, Nathan. You don't think I'm done with you? So here it is: you disappear. No one hears from you. Not your wife, not your daughter. Ever. You become a non-person, Nate. You cease to exist. If, however, you decide to take Sullivan's offer... My brother lost his little girl. Stella. Seven years old. That was 41 years ago. He's as much of a wreck now as he was then. You never get over it, Nate. That's not something you want to find out for yourself. - Hey. - Hey. You okay? You mind if I-if I... if I-if I come in? Can I come in? Sure. Daddy? Hey, sweetheart. I got a merit for my bird project. Oh, honey, that is so great. Did you know the California Condor is one of the world's longest-living birds? I did not know that, no. Is that right? There are 137 of them living in the wild. 137? - 137... in the wild? - Yeah. Yeah. Not in, like, a living room? - Not in a living room. - No? Okay. Hey, before I forget... I love you. But why would you forget? Well, you know, sometimes, people forget to say the things that they mean. And I mean it. I love you. I love you, too. Thank you. What is it, Nate? Come on. Talk to me. I wanted to matter... Nicole. What are you talking about, Nathan? You-you matter. You matter to me. You matter to Katie. But that wasn't enough, was it? If I'm being honest with myself, I wasn't here. Which means what? It means that... ...that the other thing that I did with my life... ...was more important to me. You know, I, um... My whole life... My whole life, I wanted to see what it was like on the inside of that velvet rope. And once you... you get that invitation... ...to the party... ...and you're there, and you're... you're drinking... ...you realize that you don't have anything in common with the people there. And you realize... And you left the people that you love... ...the most... in this whole... world... on the other side of that rope. I am sorry. I am... I am so... ...so... ...sorry. Nate. I know. And with Yambo Kanté being implicated in the Al Moctar - arms scandal, Aminata Sissoko - Thank you. is expected to become interim president after she was cleared yesterday at the high court. You should come with me. Work for you? I can't think of anyone else I'd rather have by my side. I'd love to. Thank you. - See her? - Yeah, I see her. I'm going to run again. For reelection. As an independent. You think you stand a chance? Thanks for the vote of confidence. Hey. I didn't know you were going to come. Oh, you think I'd miss your moment in the sun? You deserve this, Meaghan. Thank you. I should, uh... Yeah. Go. I call this hearing to order. I call on our first witness, Nathan Shane Miller. We don't want to deal with the Americans on this. Completely understand. Our company is wholly Australian-owned, and we would take every care to ensure that the Malian people and the Malian government share equally in the wealth generated by our mining operations. Okay. Because we need a change. Thank you. Let it be recorded that the witness, Nathan Miller, has not shown. I have been advised that a warrant will be issued for his arrest. He will not defy the will of the American people. This committee is adjourned. Son of a bitch. Gentlemen, the Middle East is fucked. We should know. We fucked it. Six of the ten fastest-growing economies are in Sub-Saharan Africa. Countries rich in mineral wealth. Coltan for our computers, cobalt for our batteries, phosphates for our agriculture, nuclear ore for our power. These are the things, gentlemen, that the wars of the next 20, 30 years will be fought over. A huge deposit of cobalt was discovered in Mali just over two years ago. Back then, we approached the Malian government about mining rights. They told us... that those rights were going to the Chinese. So we set about to create the conditions to make sure that wouldn't happen. And just last week, uh... one of our Australian subsidiaries... thank you, Lachlan... secured those rights. Our pilot project in Mali hit a few bumps, but I'm delighted to report that it worked. And if it can work there, there's no reason it can't work in other mineral-rich countries across Africa. We create the chaos... and then we move in and capitalize on that chaos. We're looking at the long-term here, gentlemen. Rates of return that'll make Iraq and Afghanistan look like chicken feed.
