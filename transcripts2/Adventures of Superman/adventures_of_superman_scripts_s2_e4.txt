 bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.

The boy's been flying too much lately. I can never get that nephew of mine to take a vacation. Jeepers, what a life.

 Can you imagine getting paid to fly jets? Any time you want to quit the newspaper business and take up flying, you have my permission. With or without wings. Oh, I mean, it would be... [SIGHS] No, sir. I mean... I intend to keep my feet on the ground. Yes, sir. You better leave the flying business to Chris White and Superman, Jim. CHRIS [ON RADIO]: Eight-six calling Pico Tower. Going up to 50,000 now to make the level run. Over. CONTROLLER [ON RADIO]: Pico Tower. Go ahead, Eight-six. Ready for the level run now. Altitude 50,000 feet. Visibility is perfect. Out. Hang on. Here we go. Eight-six calling Pico Tower. She's a wildcat. I thought the plane would run away from me. I'm going to try her in a dive now. CONTROLLER: Tower to 86. Just stick to level runs as scheduled. Nothing fancy. Sorry, tower, I can't hear you. I'm coming down. General, can't you stop him? He's a civilian, Mr. White. [JET SOARING] You don't think you can see him through the ceiling, do you, Clark? Hm? Oh. Just an unconscious reaction, I guess. Eight-six to tower. I'm diving. Okay so far. Speed is Mach point-6. Mach point-7... Point-8... Relax, chief, he's okay. Point-9. All smooth. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Point-9-5. She's really a smooth one, general. Wait a minute. I think I'm feeling... Feeling a little woozy there. I can't seem to... To get my breath. CONTROLLER: Eight-six. Eight-six. Over. Over. He is in trouble. I-I-I can't stand it. I've got to get outta here. [♪♪♪] [ENGINES STRAINING] CHRIS: Eight-six to tower. There he is. The plane's a gem. I'm sorry I am the one who... CONTROLLER: Come in, Chris. Keep fighting it, Chris. You can make it. No. Not this trip, son. This is awful. Jeepers, he really is in a spot. CONTROLLER: Chris. Come in. Come in, Chris. Chris, can you hear me? Come in. Come in, Chris. Keep fighting it, Chris. You can make it. Chris, come in. [ENGINES RUNNING NORMALLY] Yes. I can breathe now. Somehow, something seems to be leveling the ship. Thank heavens. CONTROLLER: Slow her gradually, Chris. Come on in. Eight-six to tower. Roger. Coming downstairs now. The easy way. LOIS: Well, Mr. Kent, while you weren't feeling very well, it may interest you to know, Chris made it. Well, I'm very glad. It's a good thing he didn't have to depend on you to help him. Yes, sir. Now, just a little statement for the press, captain. Well done. What about the new jet? Break any records? I can't tell you anything. Are you okay? Sure. SUMMERS: I said no interviews. How did you get on the field? It's a trade secret, general. But if you really wanna know, I stabbed two guards, bribed the lieutenant colonel, and then flew over the fence. Too bad you're not in uniform. You're from the Blade, aren't you? That's right. Steve Martin. You're Kent, huh? That's right. I suppose you have to work on the Planet to get special privileges. These people aren't here as reporters, Mr. Martin. They're personal friends of Captain White. And he arranged the visit. You'll get any official information just as soon as soon as the Planet does, Martin. Yeah. I'll bet. [SIGHS] You had us worried for a minute, son. Oh, I had myself worried, sir. You know, a pilot has a cracking point just like a plane, Chris. Now, you've been pushing too hard. Need a rest. Yes, why don't you run up to my lodge in the mountains. Relax for a few days. Unc, you're acting like I was... I could talk your boss into ordering you to take a rest. Now, why not make it easy and just go? What about my flight report? We don't need you to check the instruments and film. You can write up your own reactions and send them in. How, sir? By carrier pigeon? There's a helicopter mail service. Flies to all the hunting lodges. Looks like they've got you trapped, Chris. All right. But it will cost you one 20-gauge shotgun. If I'm going out to pasture, I wanna have some fun. That's a deal. [BOTH CHUCKLE] [♪♪♪] [CAR RUMBLING] [CAR DOOR OPENS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] Hi. How about taking a little ride with us, buddy, huh? Oh, you fellas must have the wrong cabin. Frenchy, you don't think we got the wrong cabin? Mm-mm. Let's go. Somebody wants to talk to you. Talk to me? Who? Never mind. Just let's go, huh? I'm not going anyplace. Or do I have to start my hunting a little early? You can't fire a gun with no bolt in it, captain. What kind of a gag...? Whoa, wait a minute. Let's not argue about this, huh? You gotta lose. I wouldn't be too sure of that. Frenchy, it looks like this man needs a little convincing. [GRUNTS] Maybe you ought to go back to the gym, huh? Lucky punch. He caught me with a lucky punch... Lucky punch. You're lucky he didn't knock your brains out. Now, let's pick him up and get him outta here. Hey, wasn't we supposed to look for some kind of report? We're supposed to deliver the captain. If the guy wants to pay us more money, we come back and deliver the report. Gee, you should have been a businessman. Yeah, I am. Now, come on, let's get moving. Leave that alone, nitwit. It'll be hard to explain someday where you got it. Carry the guy to the car. Yes. That's it, eh? Okay, thank you. [SIGHS] Something wrong, chief? Well... I finally managed to contact that helicopter pilot. He stopped at the cabin. Chris wasn't there. That's nothing to get alarmed about. He's probably out hunting. Without his rifle? The pilot found it outside lying on the ground. Chris wouldn't be that careless with a gun. What about that flight report? Any word on that? Not a word. Nothing. And that isn't like him. Chief, what do you say I take a run to that cabin and just have a look around. PERRY: I'd appreciate it, Kent. CLARK: Fine. I'll leave right away. Good. Can I go along with you, Mr. Kent? Olsen, if you barge into this office, I'll... I'm sorry, chief, sir. I mean, I just happened to hear that... Oh, you just happened to hear? Yes, sir. The door was open, and I couldn't help it. Kent, will you do me a favor? Take him with you. Get him out of my hair. But, chief... No buts. That's an order! Take him with you, and if you can, lose him along the way! I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. Kent. Thanks, chief. Don't call me chief! [♪♪♪] Hey, what's this doing out here? I don't know, Jim. We'll have to ask Chris. [JIGGLES DOORKNOB] Maybe there's a door open around back. Go look. What is it, Jimmy? How'd you get in there? Oh. Well, the door wasn't locked after all, Jim. It was just stuck. I don't see how you could have... Shh! Someone's coming. I don't hear any... Oh, yes, I do. We'd better hide until we find out who it is. Hey, Nate, look at that. Yeah, I'm looking. Maybe the wind, huh? You ever hear of the wind busting a lock off? Whoever came must have went already. Okay, get busy and find that report. What do we do now, Mr. Kent? Sit tight. When they leave, I'll try and follow them. Hey, you know what? I think we're looking for something that ain't here. If it ain't here, we can't find it. But he said not to come back without it. What do you want me to do? Write one? Come on. You stay here, Jim. And keep your eyes open. [♪♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH] What did you stop the car for? I didn't do nothing. It stopped by itself. What did you do with Captain White? I said, what did you do with Captain White? Tell him, Nate. Tell him what we done. Shut your big mouth. I'll talk. I'll tell you. Shut up. Tell me, Frenchy. We got hired to kidnap him. Who hired you? We don't know. We got our orders over the phone. We left him tied in the alley. You left him in an alley. And then what? We got another call. The guy told us to come back and look for some kind of report. Where did you get these calls? Excelsior Hotel, room 20. He's gonna call again at 5. That's it, honest. Hey, Nate. That cape. I know. It's Superman. All right, boys, end of the line. What are you gonna do with us? I'll leave that to the police. What was your air speed? Altitude? Where's your flight report? Your air speed, altitude. What kind of fuel did you use? No comment. You'll comment. You're wasting your time. Now, look, captain. Look. What does it matter to you, huh? The information is top military secret. That's what it matters. And nobody's gonna talk it out of me or beat it out of me. Oh, so that's it? Well, okay, cap. I know the right people who will pay the right price. So there's enough in it for both of us. How much will you take? Let's say 5 million. Five million. Are you nuts? Then it's no deal. Well, I'm tired of playing around with you, kid. Excelsior Hotel? Give me room 20. Hello, Nate? Yeah. Yeah, I know. But did you get...? Just a minute. Just a minute, you're not Nate. Well, looks like somebody's playing games, captain. We'll have to get outta here. Come on. Come on. Get up. Get up. Martin? That just cost you your life... captain. Great Caesar's ghost! We just can't sit here like bumps on a log. There's not much we can do, chief. Henderson's got that man staked out in the hotel room waiting for the call. So until we hear... [PHONE RINGS] You take it, Kent. I'm too upset. All right, chief. Kent speaking. What's that? Oh, I see. All right. Who was it? Inspector Henderson. Well, what did he say? What did he say? Well, a call came through, all right. But whoever it was got suspicious and hung up before they could trace it. [SIGHS] Well... there goes our last hope. Heaven only knows what's happened to Chris now. Don't your boys ever clean up after themselves? Looks like a thorough job. If the report had been here, they'd have found it. So? So I expect the cops to come nosing around here later, looking for clues. But that's not all they're going to find. Unless you changed your mind about talking. What do you think, Martin? Sit down. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Who's that? The United States Marines, I hope. Look, answer it. Whoever it is, get rid of them fast. But don't forget this gun. One phony move, and you've had it. Along with whoever's out there. Come on. Get over there. Howdy. You Chris White? Yeah. I'm Tim Mallory. I fly the whirlybird around here with the mails. Mind if I step in? Well, the place is kind of a mess. Oh, I don't mind that. You ought to see where I live, huh? My wife... Now, look, Tim, really, you caught me at a bad time. Oh, okay, Mr. White, if you got no mail you want to go out. No. Nothing. Except that letter to Perry White at the Daily Planet I left for you the other day. Letter? But I... It was very urgent. I wanted to make sure he got it. Come to think of it, maybe I slipped up on that. Maybe I put the letter in the other sack. I-I'll take care of it. Thanks. Sure thing. Oh, Tim. Yeah? I, uh, was wondering when you'd be coming by again. Oh, day after tomorrow. See you then. Sure. Thanks again. So that's what happened to that report, huh? Sent it on to your dear uncle. Well, it's too late for that anyway. Come on. Sit down. Put your hands behind you. You have to tie up a man to shoot him? Who said I'm gonna shoot you? I'm just gonna get rid of you and this cabin all in one big, bad accident. [♪♪♪] [KEROSENE CAN RUSTLING] You got one last chance. Now, tell me what I want to know. I'll leave you here alive. I'll make sure that they find you, after I'm safely out of the country. Have a good trip, traitor. Okay, hero. When that flame reaches that gas tank, you'll think a blockbuster went off. Golly, Mr. Kent, can't you get ahold of Superman and have him do something? Look, Jim, maybe Superman can find a needle in a haystack. But he has to know which haystack. That's just fine. Even if Superman is helpless in a case like this, what chance do we have? [BUZZER SOUNDS] Ahem. Yes? SECRETARY: Someone to see you, Mr. White. Says it's important. It better be. Send him in. Howdy. I'm looking for Mr. White. This is Mr. White. I'm a busy man. What is it? Well, I hate to bother you, but something happened, and I got to thinking... You got to thinking what? Well, about the young man up in the cabin. You mean Chris? Uh, that's him. Yeah. What about him? Well, if you folks are busy... No, no, no. Please. Please. Well, you see, I-I-I'm positive that he didn't leave no urgent letter like he told me when I went by the cabin a couple of hours ago. So I figured... You mean, you actually saw Chris in that cabin two hours ago? That's what I said, yeah. Well, that's impossible! You couldn't have. But I did, ma'am. Yeah. How did he get back there? Kent. Kent! Get me the police and make it quick. Yes. [♪♪♪] [COUGHING] Superman. Boy, am I glad to see you. I'm glad to see you, too. Alive. Can you make it? I think so. Come on, boy. The gun. I gotta have the gun. Are you all right? Yeah. Can you drive? I think so. I happen to know Clark Kent will be along this way any minute. You can meet him on the road. Kent, good. He's a pretty swell guy, in spite of what Lois thinks of him. Well, he'll be glad to hear this. CLARK: I still don't know what happened to that report. Magic. I just rolled it up and made it disappear. Hm. Just like that, huh? Almost. That's why I asked Superman to go back in after the rifle. Well... that's what I call using your head. [PHONE RINGS] Excuse me, will you? Mm-hm. Mr. White's office. MR. WHITE: I know it's my office, you idiot. Hello, chief. I'm at the sheriff's office. The cabin's been burned to the ground. And Chris must have been in it. No, chief. Chris was in the cabin, but he's here right now. Hold on. Hello, Unc. You know, I've been worried about you. You've been worried about me? Now, you listen, young man. Stay right there. Don't move. Do you hear? Okay. This is Kent, Chief. Now, listen. I want you to have the sheriff announce that Chris died in that fire. I'll explain later. Somebody better explain. Now, get right over here. Okay, chief. Why keep it under his hat? Well, we don't have any proof against Martin, do we? No, I guess not. How do we get it? Just put me in touch with General Summers. Give me metropolitan 6-2343, please. How long is it going to be, general? We should get our first report in a few minutes. Well, how does it feel now, Kent? Now that the other newspapers in town have been invited to the test? No one ever tried to keep you out, Martin. Not much, you didn't! SUMMERS: If men are gonna argue, I'll have to clear the room. I'm very sorry, general. CHRIS [ON RADIO]: Eight-six calling Pico Tower. CONTROLLER [ON RADIO]: Pico Tower. Over. CHRIS: Going up to 50,000 now to make the level run. Over. CONTROLLER: Go ahead. But take it easy, Chris. Something wrong, Martin? No. No, nothing's wrong. Say, that's not the same pilot that flew the test last week, is it? CHRIS [ON RADIO]: It's the same pilot all right, Martin. Are you sure there's nothing wrong, Martin? But you're... You're... He's what? Stand back. All of you. [♪♪♪] I should have killed you the first time. You're scared, Martin. You're shaking. That's bad for the aim. [GUN CLICKING] No! Clark, do something! Help him! Let the boy have a good time, Lois. Ugh! Ooh! [PANTING HEAVILY] Well, for a while there, I could have used a little more help from Superman again. Well, that's more than you got from Clark. From where I stood, you put on a pretty good Superman performance yourself, Chris. [♪♪♪] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
