 The Daily Planet plans to give Dan Grayson an award for being citizen of the year. Grayson is a dedicated family man, active in community groups and a loyal employee of a fur company. He also a former convict, something he's managed to keep hidden in his new life. That all changes when a criminal from Grayson's past blackmails him, wanting Grayson's help on a robbery of the fur company. Unsittingly, Grayson has already provided one boost. Grayson accidentally locked himself in fur company's vault, which requires Superman to get him out. The vault can't be repaired for days, something that will help the criminals. Clark Kent attempts to help Grayson but the former convict is implicated when the criminals rob the fur company without his help. Grayson tracks down the criminals but is at their mercy.

 bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way. And now, another exciting episode in the Adventures of Superman! [♪♪♪] There it is, Mr. Foster... the Daily Planet's Citizen of the Year award. As much as I'd like to have it, I'm sure it's not for me. But it may be for one of your employees, Dan Grayson.

 Dan? He's been in charge of my fur storage department for ten years. You couldn't find a better man. That's what the Planet thinks too. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? MAN: Grayson? Yeah. MAN: Dan Grayson? Yeah. Who's this? [SHELLS CRACKING] Just an old friend of yours, Dan. A real old friend. Look, uh, either say who you are, or... Don't bother to hang up. I'll do it. I've got all I want to know. [PHONE CLICKS OFF] Well, your recommendation, on top of everything else I've been able to learn about Dan sounds good enough for me, Mr. Foster. Could I arrange to meet him personally? Oh, of course. [ALARM BLARING] That's the emergency signal from the vault. Dan! Dan! I finally did it, Mr. Foster... Locked myself in. Well, take it easy, Dan. Uh, we'll get you out. How? The combination's set, and the time lock's on. Nobody's gonna open this tin can till 9:00 in the morning. Oh, that place is filled with gas... a special moth preventative. No human can take it for very long. What do you mean by "very long"? Well, one hour, maybe. What about the people that made the vault? Oh, they're a thousand miles from here. What we need's a Jimmy Valentine. Maybe I can get one for you. Sit tight, Dan. Uh, we'll think of something. Well, no use freezing, Mr. Foster. What do you think I'll look best in? Mink or ermine? Miss Dale... get me the police rescue unit. Tell them that... Superman! Thanks heavens! Over there, hurry! Next time, you'd better wear a gas mask. I... Well, thanks. That's all I can say. And that goes for me too. I... I had my mind on something else, I... I wasn't thinking, and the coat caught on something. I gave it a little yank and pulled the door closed. Mr. Foster, I tried to... Thanks, Kent, but you needn't have bothered. Superman was here. Superman, huh? Well, it looks like you're a pretty lucky fellow, Dan. Oh, I'm Clark Kent. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet anybody, in fact. Gee, I can't tell you how sorry I am, Mr. Foster. Oh, forget it, son. It'll only take a few days to repair the vault. I'll hire a special watchman in the meantime. What kind of fur do you call this, Dan? Oh, I'm building that for my son. It's a birthday surprise. I think you'd better forget the coats and the boats for now. Take the rest of the afternoon off. How about a good, hot cup of coffee, Dan? Sounds swell. Thanks a lot, Mr. Foster. All right. Oh, home so early? Since when did you start keeping bankers' hours, Mr. Grayson? I pulled a real dandy today. I locked myself in the vault. Oh, Dan. Are you all right? Sure, I'm fine. But the vault came off second best. Where's Tim? Oh, he's upstairs. Wait'll he hears who saved me today. Oh, Dan, tell me. Who? [DOORBELL RINGS] Wait a minute. I'll get it. Well, Danny boy. Luke Maynard. In the flesh. So you were the one, the man on the telephone. One and the same, Danny boy. [SHELLS CRACKING] Have some walnuts. No thanks. What do you want? You know, when a guy's in prison, he... he thinks of a lot of things. Some guys it's horses, others it's golf. Me, it was walnuts. What was it with you, Danny boy? That was 15 years ago. I've put it out of my mind. And out of a lot of other people's minds too, huh? Get to the point. You remember Blackie Harris? Blackie Harris? Sure, he was one of your old cellmates. He's been going straight a long time. Sends me 20 bucks a week. And uh, Tom-Tom Riley, the embezzler. He sends me 15. Why should they pay you anything? Why should they pay me anything? The same reason you're gonna pay. I wouldn't pay you in wooden nickels. It's a kind of insurance against people learning you're an ex-con. Because if they do... Listen, Luke! Get out of here and stay out. You'll see it my way. Maybe I'll have to open your eyes a little, but you'll see. I admit it's a rather unorthodox way to make the Citizen of the Year, but for my money, Dan's it. He seems to be the model community man. PTA, BSA and YRC. Parent Teachers Association, Boy Scout work... and what? Youth Recreation Center, Jimmy. It's his own special project. He made it himself, raised the money and practically built it with his own hands. The finest in the city. Well, now let's dispense with the two choruses of "He's a Jolly Good Fellow" and go to work. Lois, you take care of the background stuff, history of the award, etcetera. Kent, you take care of the pictures, interviews, etcetera. Yes, sir. What about me, chief? You take care of the etcetera. Yes, sir! What am I so happy about? Who was at the door? What's wrong, dear? Um... nothing, nothing, Peg. It was, uh, just an old friend. Hi, Tim! Hey, what's the matter? You been fighting with that Baxter kid again? What is this? Both of you. What's happened today? Uh, nothing, Peg, nothing, uh... Come here, son. [FOOTSTEPS] Who let you in here? Your boss. He said I should come right up, so I come right up. Nice guy. Too bad if he found out. Okay, Luke. You win. But I can't pay you anything for a couple of weeks. I said if you'll give me a couple of weeks, I... I'm gonna give you a break, Dan. You don't have to pay like the other guys. All you have to do is a little favor. There's no such thing as a little favor for you. That's all. All you have to do is help me heist some of these skins. The furs? Are you crazy? There's a little café around the corner. Meet me there tomorrow. Lunch. We'll talk. How 'bout it? Well, I... I'll think it over. That's a good boy. Think hard. And fast. Come on, Tim. Bet I can beat you in a game of checkers. No, thank you. [DOORBELL RINGS] Hiya, Dan. Oh, uh, this is Lois Lane. We both work at the same paper. BOTH: How do you do? Aren't you going to ask them in, Dan? Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Thanks. Come in. CLARK: Thank you. Um, this is my wife, Peg, uh... Ms. Lane and Mr. Kent. How do you do? How do you do? And this is our boy, Tim. Hiya, Tim. Well, Dan, we've got some great news for you. I'm afraid I don't understand. We'll need pictures, interviews. In other words, Mr. Grayson, the story of your whole life. What for? Well, Dan, the Daily Planet has picked you for the Citizen of the Year award. Oh, Dan, how wonderful! I'm, uh... I'm sorry, Mr. Kent. You better get yourself another boy. Oh, don't be modest, Dan. Besides, it's too late. The first editions are already on the street with the news. You can't do a thing like that without asking me. And my answer is no. I'm sorry, but... Now, if you don't mind, I... Of course, Dan. Some other time. We better go, Clark. Uh, yes, I... I guess we'd better. Well, good night. Chief, it just doesn't figure. That's the trouble with these gimmicks. You're always coming up with someone who wants to play hard to get. [INTERCOM BUZZES] Yes? WOMAN: There's someone waiting in Mr. Kent's office, a Mr. Grayson. Hiya, Tim. I guess you're Mr. Grayson too, aren't you? Well, what do you want to talk about? I came to ask you not to... Please, Mr. Kent, all those things you're gonna print about my daddy... Please don't tell everybody that he was in jail. Your daddy was in... Now, Tim, you know I wouldn't do anything to hurt your daddy. You believe that, don't you? I... I guess so. So we'll just keep it a secret between the two of us. Okay? Okay. That's my boy. Come on. All right, Mr. Kent, now you've uncovered the skeleton in my closet. Where do we go from here? Well, maybe we better start by your telling me more about it. It's the usual story. Wrong bunch of kids. Borrowed a car one night, supposed to belong to one of the kids' brothers... It didn't. I thought it was just for a joy ride. It wasn't. Turned out to be for armed burglary. I got three years. Three years. Now I gotta pay for it the rest of my life. How do you mean? Blackmail. Guy named Luke Maynard. He wants me to help him get at these furs. So now I gotta go to the police. And then everything comes out, right? No. All comes out wrong. Maybe you won't have to go to the police. I've got no choice. Listen, Dan, the next time this Luke calls you, tell him you're willing to do anything he says. Pretend you'll follow any orders he may give you. Then you get in touch with me right away. Well, we'd still have to ring in the police, wouldn't we? Not if we can ring in Superman. Thanks, Danny boy. With this I can turn off the burglar alarm and breeze right through the front door. Is that all? One more little thing. The watchman. I figured you wouldn't let me off that easy. Here's how it happens. Instead of leaving after work, you hide in the vault room. At 12:00, exactly 12, you take care of the copper. How you do it, that's your worry. Just do it. And then? You're through with it. And Danny boy... no double-cross. It wouldn't be healthy for your wife and kid. Now, let's see... You take care of the watchman at 12, and at 12:15 Luke arrives, right? That's the setup, Mr. Kent. Mm-hm. Well, of course you won't go through with it. You go right home after work and you stay there. Do you understand? Yeah. Yeah, I understand. A-and thanks, Mr. Kent. Operator, this is an emergency call. Will you please send an ambulance to the Metropolis Fur Company? 3-2-4 Cooper Street. A watchman. Concussion. [DOORBELL RINGS] [DOORBELL RINGS] Grayson? Yeah. Police officer. Like to have a little talk with you downtown. A fine man you chose for the Citizen of the Year award, Kent. Our own headline says, "Ex-con questioned in fur robbery." I know, chief. I've seen it. I'm sure he had nothing to do with that robbery. Ha. Well, for your information, Mr. Kent, the law isn't going to be interested in what you're sure of. Look, chief. The man made a mistake, years ago. But he's paid his debt to society. And now he's got a fine family, a good reputation and a fine circle of admiring friends. And now he's being held on suspicion of robbery. Great! But he's innocent. What are we gonna do? Just walk away from him? Kent, you know as well as I do, if an editor takes his finger off the public pulse, he's dead. All right, chief, but will you hold off just a little while longer? I think Lois and I will pay the Graysons another visit. All right, a little longer. And that means "little." Hiya, Dan. Hello. Your wife told us we could wait for you. Sorry you had to wait. I was looking for a job. Any luck? What do you think? Oh, everybody was very nice. But they all had some excuse. Any excuse except the real one. Dan... where were you last night? That's what the police want to know. They don't like my answer. Why not? Because they don't wanna believe I was out just wandering the streets most of the night. I have to admit, I am the likeliest suspect in town. I could have done it. They think I, uh, locked myself in the vault on purpose, just to make sure the door would be broken for a few days. Ah. There's only one thing to do, and that's to find the guilty man. What good will it do? Everybody knows I'm a con. Ex-con. Look, Mr. Kent, let's face it. The way most people feel, once a con, always a con. I just spoke to Inspector Henderson. They've got Luke Maynard at headquarters for questioning. We'd better get over there. Sit tight, Dan. I'm getting tired of sitting tight. Very tired. Hi Tim. How come you're not out playing with the other boys? The other kids won't play with me anymore. Come here, son. I, uh... I got a surprise for you. You remember that boat that you wanted so bad, the one I promised you for your birthday? Well, how'd you like to have it right now? Here. How do you like it? Go head, take it. It's yours. Thanks. I've been here all day like you said, Mr. Kent, but I haven't found out anything. Neither have we, yet. That's okay, inspector, always glad to cooperate with the police. Oh, Kent. It's about time I heard your part in all this. Later, inspector, I've got something else I have to do right now... I hope you do have something. And not later. But now. You heard the man, Lois. We're being held for questioning. See you back at the office, Jim. Let's go. Yeah... back to the office. Turnoff to the cave's a couple hundred yards ahead. Once we get there, we'll be in the clear. And Danny boy'll be holding the sack. DAN: Hold it. Well, if it ain't Danny boy. Kinda young to be playing with guns, ain't you? I've got nothing to lose now, Luke. If this rap gets pinned on me, I'm through. You're gonna show me where the furs are now. Then we're gonna go back and have a little talk with the law. Better show him, Luke. I ain't showing him nothin'. That's far enough. Is it? Don't make me shoot, Luke. Shoot? Go ahead. Hide the car and meet me in the cave. You're a sucker, Danny boy. You shoulda shot me. There's your furs. Never recognize 'em, would you? How do you like our place? Right in the middle of a mountain. A guy get killed here and nobody'd ever know the difference. Luke, we was followed. That kid reporter. I saw him pull away. Sort of changes your schedule, doesn't it, Luke? Jimmy calls Kent, Kent calls Superman. So what? I know about Superman. One thing his x-ray vision can't see through is lead. So guess what I got this cave lined with. [PHONE RINGS] Kent speaking. What? Oh, they disappeared into a secret entrance, huh? Can you give the exact location of that mountain? Good work, Jim. Now, look, you get hold of Inspector Henderson. I'm gonna try something else. We passed a ranger station a couple of miles back. Jimmy could call Kent from there. Superman could have the message by now. In fact, he could be here by now. When I want information, I'll ask for it. Oh, sure, Luke, sure. It's nothing to get nervous about, is it? That's right. Nothing. Stop staring at me. Take it easy, Luke. This is a bad time to blow a gasket. Even if Superman can't see you, he might hear you. Shut him up, Al. You know how I can tell you're nervous? Because if you weren't nervous, you'd be picking at those... Picking at what? These? Thanks for reminding me. [WALNUT SHELLS CRACKING] You won't need that anymore. It was Luke's idea, the whole thing. Honest. I know. You just came along for the ride. Well, next time don't team up with anyone with such a noisy appetite. What do you mean? How'd you find us? Maybe he can't see through lead, but that doesn't mean he can't hear through it. I tried to warn you, Luke. Luke is gonna hear from a judge. KENT [ON TV]: And now it gives me great pleasure to present the Daily Planet's Citizen of the Year award to you, Dan Grayson. Well, I... I don't know what to say, uh... I never thought anything like this could happen to me, and... Well, thank you. Thank you all very much. Just a minute, Dan. I'd like to speak to you for a moment. All of you out there in the audience. And especially to a little boy, Tim Grayson. To me, Mom. Tim, I hope you're as proud of your dad today as the rest of us are. Because we feel that we have a right to be proud. But there's more to it than that. Dan has certain rights too. Dan and other men like him who have paid their debt to society and now only ask a chance, a chance to prove themselves. The chance of a lifetime. Let's not make them spend that lifetime in the shadow. Because Dan and other men like him feel that they only want an opportunity to take their place in life, to make their homes, raise their children, make their community a better place to live in. Well, Dan has done all these things. Just because he was a convict once doesn't mean he's any different now. In fact, we think he's... something kind of special. How about you, Tim? He's the best, huh, Mom? The very best, Tim. I'll be right home, Tim. [♪♪♪] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
