 bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way. [♪♪♪] Oh, I'm sorry. Clark! Oh, Lois. Well, see you later. Oh, no you don't! You were taking me to lunch today. There's plenty of time. It's only quarter of 12. I'll see you later. Uh, Having lunch with you doesn't really matter, Mr. Kent.

 But knowing what you're up to does. [SIGHS] All right. Remember him? Happy King? Of course I do. Wrote as many stories on him as you did. That was years ago. Yeah, stories about everything but his arrest. So the police couldn't get anything on him. But Superman did. At least that's why he left the country. Mm-hm. If he'd stuck around, Superman would have gotten him. Clark, what's this all about? Crook's still in Europe, isn't he? No. But this is for S... Yeah, I know. Mm. It came to me care of the paper for Superman. He wants to see him tomorrow at noon sharp. "Have a little talk about settling our difficulties." Don't tell me he came back to make friends with Superman? Clark, I just don't believe it. It's probably a joke or a fake. May even be a trap of some kind. Though I don't know how there could be a trap for Superman. That's why I am going to be there today, at noon sharp. Why are you going? Oh. Well, I thought I might go and look the ground over, this place he's picked out. And if it's a hoax, I'll save Superman from going on a fool's errand. Uh, not if the noon part is important. Why? It's two minutes of. You're a little late. Bye! OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn [♪♪♪] One minute of. So? So why be nervous? He's not coming here. 360 Warehouse Street. I picked a good place all right. It's deserted. Wonderful. Wonderful. But maybe he did not get your message, Mr. King. No, he'll get it, all right. There's a guy on the Daily Planet who'll give it to him. A nosy reporter by the name of Clark Kent. He's a friend of Superman's, I think. I don't know why though. Heh, heh. You... You Americans. You never make sense. You send a message, you say noon tomorrow, and yet you expect... It's like playing a game of checkers, see? Checkers? I say tomorrow, so Superman figures he'll jump me. He'll go there and look around today. And what do I do? Today, I am ready with a double jump. Today, the trap is set. Pretty smart, huh? Mm-hm. Why, I would rather play gin rummy. I didn't bring you all the way from Europe to hear you make wisecracks. All you've got to do is learn what this guy is made of! All right. All right, Mr. King! All right. But I, uh... I did make progress, have I not? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, if my theory is correct... If Superman is really from some other planet, say, from the now-extinct planet Krypton, for example, why, soon we may be able to destroy him by using... [HORN SOUNDS] It's noon. [♪♪♪] [TRAIN BELL RINGS] No, uh... No, I ain't seen nobody around. Are you positive? Of course I am. Except, uh, well, uh, I have been asleep, you understand. Surely. Never mind. Oh say, uh... I heard some shooting just a couple of seconds ago. I mean, if that's any help. No. Someone tried a very stupid trick, and it didn't work. [CAR HORN HONKS] [SIGHS] But Clark, how do you know this happened to Superman? Oh, Superman told me, Lois. Did you get there right afterwards? Well, I was there, Jimmy. We've all known what kind of a man this Happy King is and how much he hated Superman. Yes, but he and Superman have tangled before, Lois. He knows that bullets can't hurt him. I don't know what he's up to. Well, what did Superman think? Why did he think Happy King would set a booby trap that wouldn't work? [SIGHS] Well, Superman didn't tell me. Oh, Clark. There you are at the scene of a terrific story, and what do you do about it? Is something the matter with your shoulder, Mr. Kent? Hmm? Oh. Um, just a bee sting I think, Jimmy. [SIGHS] I wonder what he is up to. Beautiful. Beautiful. He ripped the Tommy gun, but he never thought of the camera. Ah! Now, this is the one. Meldini, you've done it! How about me, Mr. King? Pretty good picture, ain't it? Number 14. Bullet number 14. Is that the one? See how the camera synchronized with the gun? We were just... I said, is that the one that caused the reaction? Aah! Who is scientist here? You or...? All right, all right. Take a look for yourself. Thank you, Mr. King. But I already knew it anyway. I could tell from the slug. See? See the difference? Yes. Here it is. I noticed something funny when I picked it up. Wasn't smashed like the others. More like it bounced off him. [LAUGHS] Yes. A thing has to give a little, to, like you say, to bounce, eh? Oh, yeah. It shows. It shows here. Kryptonite. From the planet Krypton, where Superman was born. The only bullet he could feel contained elements of Kryptonite. [LAUGHS] Amazing, isn't it. The Delphinian theory. It proves the Delphinian theory of reverse effects. Materials which would be harmless to him in their own environment, when they are transposed to our Earth, they... They have the reverse. The dangerous effect on him. Yeah, that's great. That's great. What do we do next? But... But the theory. That proves the theory. And that's the important thing. Superman is vulnerable to Kryptonite. So... if we had enough pure Kryptonite... Only we don't. You made that bullet out of the stuff from the meteor, and that's all there is of it. Ah, correction please. That is all the pure Kryptonite we have. But suppose I were to... To... Ha! [LAUGHS] [♪♪♪] [CLOCK ALARM RINGS] Gentlemen... I've done it. No other scientist in the world could have created that. The only substance that can destroy Superman. Synthetic Kryptonite. [LAUGHS] Here, let me show you. Now. So... Ah... Here it is. Well, let's put it into the lead box. [LAUGHS] Oh, it will not bite you. Gentlemen, I've assured you that to us, people of the Earth, the radiation of Kryptonite is harmless. But it ain't shaped like a bullet. Ah... Who needs bullets? Mr. King, I assure you, if any man from Krypton were to come as close to this, [STAMMERS] Well... Go on, go on, go on! What if Superman should... Should touch it? Oh. Before he could even come that close, he would go... Pfft. [LAUGHS] Ah, but... But we must keep this at even temperature, until just before Superman arrives. So... Hey, what's the rush? I got a note from Mr. Kent. Hey! Give me that! Clark's on a story. It's from Happy King. A guy just left it at the switchboard. Well, don't get excited. Clark will be right back. I don't think you ought to read that. It's addressed to Superman, in care of Mr. Kent. I'll put it on his desk. Well, what did you get so steamed up about? I told you I'd leave it for Clark. Well, I guess it'll be okay. Anyway, there's plenty of time. Uh-oh. So you read it too. Well, you don't blame me, do you? Here's this King guy trying to set up another meeting with Superman... and you remember what happened the last time. I know. A certain reporter got a story they wouldn't even believe. But Mr. Kent said Superman gave him that story. I know, Jimmy. I just mean I'd like to get the real story. Golly, this King's a brazen character. Well, that's what I thinking. Inviting Superman to his house on the coast. He must be trying to set up a trap for him. Oh, now Jimmy, don't you start getting ridiculous. There just isn't any kind of a trap that can hurt Superman. Then why would a guy like King keep trying? I don't know. I think I'll get a sandwich. Uh, just don't mention to Mr. Kent that I left, will you? No, of course not. Oh, no, you don't! Jimmy! Well. I mean, uh... the only way I couldn't mention it to him was if I went with you. Okay. Come on along. [♪♪♪] He's got that message by now. I know he has! To meet him downtown tomorrow. Uh. Everybody here is crazy but me. It's a game of checkers, see. I moved first, then he moved. Only this time he's gonna move faster, because I let him know where we are. I let everybody know. Heh-heh. But you see, I never play checkers. Oh, shut up! Hurry up with that stuff, will you? It's almost time. Okay, Mr. King. Look out, now. That's hot. Well... what do I do with the stuff? Do I hold it in front of me or what? I've already told you. He couldn't get within yards of that Kryptonite. You better show more respect then. Because when that rock of yours gets rid of Superman, you'll be looking at the big boy in this town. I tell you, there isn't a racket that I won't be able to control. [KNOCK ON DOOR] Must be him. Laugh at checkers, will you? Right on schedule. I'd better hold this close to me. Just so he won't try anything. [KNOCK ON DOOR] All right, Superman. Come in. Uh, Mr. King, I'm Lois Lane from the Daily Planet. Everyone knows you're here, but nobody's tried to get a plain, straight interview. Now, is there any reason why you'd object to being interviewed? Of course not. It's a pleasure. I have nothing to hide. You know, people always think I'm up to something. But really I'm only here on a friendly visit. However, if you don't mind leaving, I'll see you in town later. Well, I'd like to get your story now, Mr. King. Uh, maybe later would be better, Miss Lane. Well, of course, if, uh, you're busy... Uh, just a second! Boss, this dame is practically Superman's girlfriend. I am not. When I get through with Superman, he'll be nobody's boyfriend! Well... Jump and double jump, eh? Ha! You play a strange game of checkers, Mr. King. [♪♪♪] Hello? Kent speaking. Didn't you tell me that there was a note here for me? I see. Thank you. [THUMPING ON DOOR] Well, do you think they can do it? Do you suppose that little hunk of metal could really kill Superman, like they said? Of course not. Nothing can destroy Superman. But, suppose it could kill him. Then Mr. Kent finds that note, gets in touch with Superman... Jim, I've got news for you. And when Superman comes here, if it could kill him... Jim! Superman won't be here. Huh? You'll hate me for this. I tore up that note. Hate you? I think it's wonderful. Now, even if it is a trap, Superman won't fall into it. Golly. It doesn't look so good for us, does it? Hm. "Dear Mr. Kent, "If you can contact Superman, please ask him to come to my home at 3420 Ocean Drive at once." "Signed, Happy J. King." Not a chance, Jim. It's solid steel. Yeah, I guess you're right. [SIGHS] Well... anyway, Superman's safe. And that's the important thing. Well, isn't it? Yes. Oh. Of course it is. [♪♪♪] Get the Kryptonite out of the oven. Right, Mr. King. Superman ought to be here in... I got your message, King, and... Oh, so that's it. No, Superman, stop! Wait! Wait! They're... They're both okay. Honest. They'd better be. As soon as I'm sure they're safe, I'm coming back here and have a little talk with you two! Yes, Of course we will, but... you've made a terrible mistake! Miss Lane, Jim, come on! No! Get out of here! Stay out of this house... What? What's that for? King must be crazy. He knows I can tear this house apart. Superman, listen to me. That other man up there is a scientist, and he's developed some sort of metal that... That what? Superman fell into the trap. Now, it's my turn to jump. Drop the Kryptonite down the chute. Don't worry, Miss Lane. There's no metal that can harm me. [OBJECT STRIKES FLOOR] JIMMY: That must be the metal they were talking about. They call it Kryptonite. Well, I don't care what they call it. Did you say Kryptonite?! Yeah. Well, it couldn't hurt you just to touch it. Oh, it's heavy. No, Jimmy! See? Jimmy, get it out of here! Yeah. Yeah. Superman! I'll get rid of it. He'll be all right. Oh. Oh, Jimmy get that thing out of here! I'll get rid of it. It'll be a lead-pipe cinch. [CLANK] [CLANK] Hurry! He can hardly breathe! LOIS: Oh, Jimmy, do something! Get rid of it! [CLAPS] [LAUGHS] The window. [BANGING] Oh. There's wire in the glass. It's stuck up on the ledge! JIMMY: Come over here. Help me. Superman! Gentlemen, it's time we thought of alibis. Shall we drive back to town? My town? [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS MANIACALLY] Jimmy, his heart. He can hardly breathe. Do something. What am I gonna do? How am I gonna get rid of it? The sink! Take it over there! Down the drain, Jimmy. Oh. Here. Jimmy, it's too big. It won't go down. I tell you that nobody will believe that we killed Superman. So we don't tell them. I know, checkers. Just like checkers. Why don't you shut up? That way I'll have Metropolis in my hand within a week. The other boys will be scared. But not me, see? Sure. Only what about the kid and that girl? Ah, they'll starve to death before they get out of that place. Incidentally, we'll throw their car down there... with them in it. After all, it's a rough road, and accidents will happen. You see? Everything is perfect, and checkers win out. [LAUGHS] Don't move. Don't try to move. Oh, Jimmy. [SOBS] Pipe... lead. Don't say it, Superman. I thought I could get rid of that metal. I did everything I could. I'm sorry. Sink... lead pipe. That's it, Miss Lane. Lead! What is it, Jimmy? Lead. They kept it in a lead box. Like this pipe. It's lead. Give me the metal. Here. Jimmy, I can't do it. You're better. You're gonna be all right, Superman. Sure I am, Jimmy. Thanks, both of you. Don't worry, Miss Lane. The lead protects me from its radiations. I'm all right now, see? Oh, boy. Now, get up there and take care of those guys. No Jimmy, I'm gonna let the police do that. I have something far more important to do. Kryptonite is the only thing in the world that can hurt me. Therefore, this sample is going to disappear forever. What are you gonna do now? I'll show you, Jimmy. Stand back, both of you, please. [PIPE WHISTLING] What is it? Don't know. Clear out over the ocean. Keep your eye on the road! But, look, it's clear out of sight! What was it? [TIRES SCREECH] Look out! [SIGH] Well, Clark, I told you if I got half lead I'd get the real story. Lois, I'm glad you got the story. And I'm glad you didn't write anything in it about the effect of Kryptonite on Superman. That's one thing I'm never gonna tell anybody. That's too dangerous a thing for anyone else to know. Even if there isn't any more Kryptonite in the world. Isn't it funny...? To think Superman actually has a weakness. It makes him seem almost human. For once, we had to save him. Yes. We're all pretty lucky, I guess. We? Now, don't tell me you're going to take credit for it. Oh, I'm not Lois. I'm definitely not. In fact, I'm not even human. [♪♪♪]
