 Clark Kent and Lois Lane enlist circus clown Rollo to participate in a telethon sponsored by the Daily Planet. Another clown, Crackers, is present when Rollo agrees.

Crackers, indeed, steals proceeds from the telethon but doesn't count on Rollo getting free. Superman will have to make a split decision.

 bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.

 since we was partners 10 years ago. Yeah, that's funny. We had an argument and split up. Now I can't remember what we argued about. About the same thing that brings me back. Money. I need some. Well, I haven't very much, but you can have a few dollars. A few rotten bucks, huh? I'm getting sick of having nothin' but a few rotten bucks. Well, I'm sorry Crackers, but I don't happen to have very much right now. [KNOCKING] Come in. Hello. Hello. Hello, are you Rollo? Yeah. I'm Clark Kent. This is Miss Lane. We're from the Planet. Yeah, I know. You're the tallest midget in the world, and you're the smallest giant. Well, not exactly. We've come to ask you a tremendous favor. Favor? Sure, why not? Oh, uh, this is a friend of mine, Crackers. Glad to know ya. How do you do, Crackers? Now, about this, uh, favor. What can I do for you? Well, it's quite a big favor, Rollo. We want you to help us raise a half a million dollars. Half a million dollars? You see, Rollo, in two hours from now, the Daily Planet is starting a telethon. It's a 24-hour television show to raise money for the Children's Fresh Air Camp Fund. Oh, of course, of course. Say, I'd be honored and delighted. I've got just the bit for it, too. A new act I thought up. Would you like to see it? Love it. Did ya hear that, Crackers? I'm gonna help raise half a million dollars. Yeah, I heard. I thought of this just for Metropolis, because this is where Superman lives. Is that right, Mr. Kent? That's right. You might even get to meet him. Wonderful, wonderful. Here. Now, you be the villain, and I'll be Superclown. Now, instead of taking the gun away and crushing the barrel to bits I take the gun away and... eat it. [LAUGHING] I certainly wish Superman could see that. He'd sure get a kick out of it. It's awfully nice of you to help us though, to be serious for a minute. Not at all. That's my business, my life: making children happy. All right, then. We'll see you tomorrow night on Stage Three. That's at Colossal Studios. Good, good. We'd better hurry if we're going to contact some of the other circus people. You go on in a couple of hours. Ooh, that's right. Thanks again, Rollo. Good, good. Nice to have met you, Crackers. Think of that, Crackers. Half a million dollars for the children. How does this money come in? Oh, different people send it in. By pledge, by check, by cash. Cash, huh? Yeah. Say, I got a wonderful idea, Crackers. Why don't you get back in the act? You know something, Rollo? I think I will. Good, good. [THUD] [♪♪♪] Hi. I'm looking for Mr. Kent. He said he was coming over to talk to you. Yeah. He left here a few minutes ago. You might find him somewhere else on the grounds. Jeepers. A real clown's tent. Hey, what do you use these for? For cutting off neckties, what else? All right, son. Look for Mr. Kent somewhere else. Rollo, what's that? Oh, those... Uh, those are my extra legs. I-I strap those on behind me. Oh, do they laugh at that one. Ha-ha. Yeah, that must be a riot. Yeah, come on, let's go. I want you to meet a friend mine. Hercules, the strong man. No, I'd rather not. Let's go. Well, why not? After all, I guess an opportunity like this only comes once in a lifetime. I hope. You'll like Hercules. Wait till you meet him. He's a real nice guy. Maybe... maybe we shouldn't disturb him. After all, he's probably been slavin' over a hot dumbbell all day. He loves company. Come on in. MAN: Get him away. Get him away. Get him away. Get him away. Get him away. Boo! Boy, that was close. I hate those mouses. Herky, I want you to meet a friend of mine. Jim Olsen. How are you? I'm fine. I'm fine. That's all right. I don't need this hand anyway. Sit down on that chair a minute, kid. I want a couple of words with my friend. Herky, how'd you like to make a hundred bucks? Sure, I need a new suit. These are getting shiny in the pants. Listen. Take this kid, tie him up and gag him and keep him here until midnight tomorrow. Sure, Rollo. Leave it to me. I got no conscience. This is a free trick, kid. Sit down! I just sat down. This is the trick where I put the chains around my chest... expand it until they break. Hey. Just one thing here. Aren't you putting these chains... around the wrong chest? The lock. There. Try that. Well, now, there's only one thing the matter with this trick. It doesn't work. Now, will you kindly make with the key? Why, that's a shame. Looks like he must have lost the key. Let me see what I can do. Too bad, kid. You shouldn't have seen those legs. I can't take any chances. Don't forget. Keep him here till midnight tomorrow. Sure, Rollo. Then you pay me the 100 bucks, huh? Sure, Herky. I gotta get back. Gee, that Rollo. He's the funniest clown in the world. Clark, we've really gotta hurry. Yeah, I know. Well, Jimmy's probably there already... Clark, what's the matter? Uh, nothing. Nothing, Lois. Look, you'd better go on without me. I want to see someone else. No. I'm gonna see that you get there on time. Lois, will you please... No, and that is final. All right. Please let me... get the dust off my glasses, at least. Oh. Oh, now see what you've done? You're not supposed to find them with your feet. I know, Lois, I'm very sorry. I have another pair in my office. Well, I'd better get them for you. I'll meet you at the studio. Oh, would you, please? Thanks. Thanks a lot. What you need is a full-time nursemaid. [SNORING] Superman! Hercules, why don't you learn to pick on someone your own size? You're my size, Superman. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] Jeepers, it was worth being chained to get to see that. But how did you know I was here? Did Mr. Kent tell you? Something like that, Jimmy. I'll see you later. Hey, but Superman... Wait. Aah! You'll never get away with this, Crackers. Keep your voice down if you want to live. I've killed men for less than I'm gonna make outta this. I know what you're gonna do. You're planning to take my place at the telethon and somehow steal that money. Smart boy, Rollo. I'll take it there ought to be a couple of 100,000 in cash. Not bad for one night's work, is it? Don't forget Mr. Kent. I understand he's pretty smart. I understand he's supposed to be a friend of Superman's too, but I'll still get away with it. Crackers, you're going to ruin the whole clown profession. What are the children going to think? Don't do it, Crackers. For them. [GROANS] Jimmy, where have you been? I've been looking all over for you. I'll explain later, Mr. Kent. Right now, I think there's a body in there. CLARK: A body? JIMMY: That's what I said. There, see? Rollo! Rollo, are you all right? Oh... oh. What happened? Oh, it was Crackers. Oh, you mean that fellow who was here when I met you? Yeah. You mean there are two of you? I mean, one of you and one of him? Oh, then he was made up to look like me, eh? It was you. Oh, I thought so. Well, what's this all about? Do you know? I do now. You see, Crackers came in here and wanted some money. I told him I had a month's salary coming tonight and I'd let him have $10. Oh, I see. Then he just impersonated you and got all the money. Which he must have done by now. Well, there's no use crying over spilt milk, is there? Do you feel all right? Oh, sure, sure. Fine. Ya can't keep a good clown down. Especially when he has to be on telethon, eh? Eh! [LAUGHS] Folks, this is the 22nd hour of our telethon. And we haven't even reached the halfway mark yet. Please, folks, let's not let the kids down. And now, the next guest on our program... is Sung Lo Too, the magician. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] Ladies and gentlemen, Sung Lo Too. [ORIENTAL MELODY PLAYING] [APPLAUSE] Well, everyone holding up okay? When this is over, I'm going to pull a Rip Van Winkle. Kent, we've got to go over the top. We've just got to. And right now, it looks like it will take more magic than he has up his sleeve. Well, Chief, they can't say the Planet isn't trying. This woman was hoping to talk to Superman. I don't understand it. Is there such a big difference between Superman and me? I guess I do understand it. [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] [APPLAUSE] Thank you, Sung Lo Too, for being with us tonight. Well, Mr. Kent, it's the folks out there who can really be the real magicians. You know, every contribution is the magic wand to send some underprivileged youngster to camp. Thank you, and good night. Thank you very much. And he's so right, folks. Please send your contributions in... to Stage Three, Colossal Television Studios. Or the Metropolis Daily Planet. [PHONE RINGS] We're not making any progress. The thermometer hasn't gotten past 200,000. Clark, that must have been the hundredth request. Everyone will send in big chunks of money if Superman will only make a personal appearance. I know, Lois. I thought he'd be able to be here before now. He's got to. That's all there is to it. And I'm going to hold you personally responsible, Kent. Now wait a minute, Chief. There are certain difficulties involved here... Just what should be so difficult about Superman appearing on a telethon? Especially when he knows you're Master of Ceremonies. Isn't there any way you can get him here, Clark? Well, I, I hope so, Lo... Well, I'm not going to worry about it now. I'm starving to death. I'm going out to get a sandwich. Do you mind taking over for me? Of course, Clark. Go ahead. Thank you, very much. It's just not like Superman to let us down. [APPLAUSE] Ladies and gentlemen, I know you've all been expecting Superman to make a personal appearance here, but... Superman! Now I know we'll make it. I'm sorry to be late, Miss Lane. Where did you come from? Never mind. It's all yours. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen... as you know, I have made Metropolis my headquarters. And I've done my best to give you a clean, healthy city. Now, I'm asking you to do your best. Your best for many thousands of children. Children who will grow up to be the citizens of this city. And that's just about all there is to say. So now I'm going to ask you to give. As much as you can and as soon as you can. Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE] You saved the day, Superman. Now with some help from Rollo the clown, we're sure to make it. I hope so, Miss Lane. Sincerely, I hope so. [APPLAUSE] [RINGS] Yes? Yes, it really was Superman. Hello? Two dollars? Thank you very much. Yes. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Ten dollars? Thank you. Hello? Listen to this! A thousand dollars in the name of Superman. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Thank you very much. Hello? Yes. LOIS: Thank you. There you go. Sure nice of you to take over, Mr. Kent, while I grabbed a bite to eat. Glad to do it. Still can't figure out why you insisted on wearing my cap. I don't feel comfortable without it. Well, uh... I couldn't watch properly without it, now, could I? I hadn't thought of that. Well, thanks again. You bet. Rollo, I was scared to death you weren't going to show. Me, not show? You couldn't keep me away with a team of horses. Good. Let's go. PERRY: $500? Thank you very much. JIMMY: Five dollars? [APPLAUSE] Clark, he was here. Superman was here. I know, Lois. Why didn't you come out from behind that sandwich and say hello? Well, you seemed to be doing all right. Besides, I didn't feel very necessary. Superman was a big help, but we still couldn't have done it without you, Mr. Kent. Thanks, Jimmy. Most of the cash has been coming in envelopes. I thought you folks would like to see how this contribution came. From the employees of the aquarium. Give these pledges to the tabulator, Tim. Yes, ma'am. And keep counting that money as fast as it comes in. Oh, people are bringing money from every organization in town. [LAUGHTER] [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [PHONES RINGING] Thank you, very much. [INAUDIBLE] We made it. The counters say we did it. Whoopee! Clark, how wonderful. Now this is a proud day... I mean night... for the Planet. We'll announce it. Just as soon as Rollo finishes his act. [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] Are you through, Rollo? We've got a pretty important announcement to make. Not yet, Kent, I'm just starting. What do you mean? Just this. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] Rollo, that isn't very funny. That's right. But if you know what's good for you, keep right on laughing. Make like it's part of the act. Better do as he says, Lois. Everybody will think this is a comic exit. And that's the way I want it, understand? Get that money in the bag. Come on, Lois. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] Hey, what is this? This is a heist, buddy. Keep quiet. Just behave yourself and nobody gets hurt. Rollo, I'd never have believed this of you. Gotta surprise for ya. This isn't Rollo. TIM: Hey! Don't be a hero, Clark, you're not the type. Call the police. PERRY: Great Caesar's ghost! What's happening around here? Hello? Get me Inspector Henderson. This is Clark Kent, at the telethon. Oh, sure. I've been watching the program here at the station. Say, that clown was sure funny. Well, that clown just stole all of our cash! He's armed and he's dangerous. You'd better send out an alarm. What? Alert all cars. [ALARM SOUNDING] [GUNSHOT] You better give up, Crackers. They'll kill you or they'll kill me by mistake. You used my name and my reputation to steal money from the children. I'll get you for that, Crackers. Then come and get me! [♪♪♪] Don't shoot, I'm Rollo! He is not, I'm Rollo! Hold your fire till we make sure which is which. You take care of the money. [♪♪♪] [SCREAMS] You are Rollo, aren't you? Yes, I'm Rollo. Good boy. Come on. You could only catch one of us, Superman. How did you know which one? The kind of man that you are is what gave you away, Crackers. I couldn't imagine Rollo pushing anyone off a roof. Not even you. I guess I had it coming to me. Anyway, I never was half the clown you were, Rollo. [APPLAUSE] And now, ladies and gentlemen, before we go off the air, I'd like to bring back once more, Rollo, the clown. [LAUGHTER] From what the police said, Superman saved more than the telethon tonight. But let's give Clark and Rollo a little credit, too, Lois. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS] [♪♪♪]
