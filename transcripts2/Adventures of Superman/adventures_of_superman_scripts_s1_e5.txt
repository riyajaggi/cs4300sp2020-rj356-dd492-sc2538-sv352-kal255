 It is no use, I tell you. They'll catch us. They'll torture me and kill you. You must try to escape alone. No. Please try, Father. I will help you. Listen to me, Maria. I can run from them no longer. I'm too old, too weak. But you are young. You may be able to escape. Mother's locket! Take this. Take it to America, to the President of the United States. Give it to him alone. To no other. [DOGS BARKING] I will not leave you. You must, Maria. Say to the President to open the locket. That which is inside will mean new hope for humanity. Yes, but... Listen to me, my child. The fruit of my life's work is in your hands. It must be used for the good of mankind. If those godless devils secure it, it will mean the end of freedom on earth. Take this and go to America. Do exactly as I said. And trust no one but the President. [MAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] Go! There's no more time. [DOGS BARKING] Good... Goodbye, Father. [BARKING] [MAN YELLING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [RINGS] Ja? MAN: We have traced Maria Moleska to Lisbon. She boarded a plane there for the United States. One moment. Listen carefully. There is a man named Harold Crane in Metropolis, in the United States. You will find his contact number in the secret file. Tell him I will pay him $200,000 if he secures Moleska's formula. Und tell him I am leaving for Metropolis tonight by plane. [♪♪♪] [CHILDREN SQUEALING] [CHIRPING] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Give me these. Give me these. Go over there now. [CHIRPING] That's right. Come on. Yes! [SQUEALING] Look, Clark. Supermonkey. Yeah. Now, Pepi, you give these nice little boys and girls their fortune, hey? That's right. Come on! Cute, isn't he? Uh-huh. Come on. Help the lady. That's nice! He's a cute monkey. He's smart too. Can he tell my fortune? Sure, lady, sure. Pepi, you give this nice pretty lady her fortune, huh? Come on. That's right. Thank you, Pepi. There you are, little fella. Thank you, lady. Thank you, mister. Good luck, good luck. [BARREL ORGAN PLAYING] Well, what's it say? Don't rush me. No fair, Clark. Even a reporter's entitled to a little private life. Uh-huh. Must be good. Today is the 24th, isn't it? Sure, all day. Why? Well, I'm going to marry a handsome oil millionaire by the name of Harvey. Bye, Clark. Where do you think you're going? Well, to meet Harvey. Where else? Have you forgotten we're supposed to cover the Petersen trial? You cover it. I can't keep Harvey waiting. Bye-bye. Lady! Wait, lady, wait! [MONKEY CHIRPING] Come back, lady, come back! You get in bad trouble! Here's those Moleska news clippings you wanted, Miss Lane. Thanks, Jim. And what about my plane reservation? I wangled you a seat on the 12:30 flight. You'll have to pick up your ticket at the field. 12:30. I can make it. Better get me a cab, though. I got one standing by. Good boy. You get to Baltimore at 1:50. But you got about a 1-hour layover for the Washington Limited. Miss Lane, why are you flying to Baltimore then taking a train to Washington? The chief will want to know. I hope to get an exclusive interview with Jan Moleska's daughter. No kidding? She's on that Washington train. Golly! According to the news clips, her dad's been killed. I know I'm following a wild tip, but it's worth a gamble. So long, Jim. Wait a minute! Where'd you get the tip? The chief's going to ask me. From a monkey. Huh? [PEPI CHIRPING] Hey, Pepi. Go up there. MAN: Hello, Pepi. [CHIRPS] Blast you and that stupid organ grinder! I'll show you what I'm going to do to... [PEPI CHIRPING] There, there, Pepi. I wouldn't hurt you. [SCREECHES] There you are, Pepi. There you are. Okay, on your way, Pepi. Hey, Max! [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] Yeah? That stupid organ grinder lost a message for me about Moleska's daughter. Oh, that dumb jerk. Yeah. Fortunately, he read it and remembered enough to pass it on. Say, a guy like that could be dangerous. That's what I was thinking. I could be traced through that organ grinder. He's waiting in the alley downstairs. Get rid of him. Okay, boss. You sure we won't need him no more? Frisch is on his way over here by plane. I'll have that Moleska formula tonight. Yeah, but... Get going. Okay. Well, go on. What did she tell you? Well, uh, she said she had a tip. She said it was pretty wild, but... Wild, eh? But she goes off to Baltimore just the same. On the paper's money. Doesn't even bother to consult me. Great Caesar's ghost! Now, wait a minute, chief. Lois is pretty solid. She may be a little impulsive at times... Impulsive, eh? Well, she's been impulsive around here for the last time. And that goes for you too, Kent. From here on in, nobody goes out on a story until they've checked with me. You paste that in your hat too. Yes, sir. But I think I know why Miss Lane went. I mean, I think I know where she got her tip. I... I found this on her desk. Let's see that, Jim. Lois got this from the monkey. [CLARK READS ALOUD] New schedule being followed." What is that? Where did it come from? I told you. She got it from the monkey. Are you crazy? Golly! She said something about a monkey. I better get out there. Where? The Washington Limited. If this is on the level, it's a whale of a story! I'll see you later, chief. Kent! Come back here! Kent! Kent, that train's halfway to Washington by now. Come back here. How are you going to... Great Caesar's ghost! Has everybody around here gone crazy? Good heavens! [SCREAMS] [THUMP] [♪♪♪] Porter. See if there's a doctor on this train, and hurry! MAN: Miss Lane will be all right, Superman. That's fine, doctor. What about Miss Moleska? Well, her condition is critical. Her skull has been fractured. I'd like to find the man that did it. Will she regain consciousness? She should. [WHIMPERS] There. She's coming to now. May I question her, doctor? Briefly. Miss Moleska. Who are you? Superman. I'm your friend. I have heard of you. You are good. The locket! It is gone! We'll find it for you later. But right now, I want... Father's formula was in the locket. Formula? Yes. He was sure I... Oh, no. I must not talk. Only to the President. The locket was around your neck? You must find it, Superman. It is our only defense. Defense? Against what? You... You must find it. You must... Must... She'll be all right. But she can't be questioned anymore. May I take her to a hospital? She can't be moved right now. I'll take care of Miss Moleska and Miss Lane. You find that locket. I'll certainly try. You say Superman couldn't find the fellow on the train? No. I'm going to look around some more, but... You are?! I mean, Superman is. Meanwhile, call Inspector Henderson. Tell him to try and pick up that organ grinder. Better get our own staff working on it too. Don't tell me what to do. Stop that, stop that. Wait a minute, Kent. "Tony Urmenti, organ grinder. "Body found Metropolis River, foot of 24th Street. Knife wound in heart." Hmm. What is it, chief? You'd better get over to the city morgue as quick as you can, Kent. I have a hunch the story's blown up in our face. [DOOR OPENS] Well? Joe got the locket. The formula? In the locket. Good. Swell. Getaway okay? Duck soup. Joe's on the plane now. Ought to be here in an hour, hour and a half. Well, as soon as the organ grinder brings it... Oh, I forgot. No more organ grinder. Well, you'll have to meet Joe for the pickup, then. I hate to do it. The cops know that mug of yours. Well, you've got to do it anyway. I better get started. Call Frisch. You know the number. Tell him to be here at 9:00 with the money. All of it. Every nickel. [DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING] Well? It was our organ grinder, all right. I thought so. Now what? I don't know, chief. Well, how about his family? Maybe one of them might know something. Apparently he hasn't any family. Lived all alone in a basement apartment on the West Side. Oh, fine. I wonder what's in that formula. She said it was a defense against something. Atomic bombs! If it is... Kent, we've got to get it. The monkey. What? The organ grinder's monkey. It's probably at the bottom of the river. I wonder. Anyhow, the monkey can't talk. What's the difference? It might give us a lead. Chief, it was a cute little animal. It had a Superman's costume on. Superman? That's right. A lot of people must have noticed it. Look, chief. Let's put a special bulletin in our news broadcast asking anyone who saw the monkey to please call in. I doubt that anything will come of it. But what can we lose? Go ahead. Yes, sir. Microfilm, huh? For this, we get... Look out, dummy. For this we get $200,000. Oh, not bad. [CLARK SPEAKING OVER RADIO] This kind of work pays better than the rackets! CLARK [OVER RADIO]: Anyone seeing a brown monkey dressed in a Superman costume and answering to the name "Pepi," please communicate with Clark Kent at the Daily Planet or the police at once. Or anyone having any special knowledge of this monkey or its owner, the late Tony Urmenti, an organ grinder, please contact this paper or the police without delay. And now, the news. Today, the United Nations... [RADIO CLICKS OFF] What's the idea? I kinda like the news. What did you do with the monkey? Nothing. It got away. Got away how? When I caught up with Tony, see, I walked him down the alley a-ways to where the car was before I let him have it. While I was loading him into the car, the monk scrammed. Scrammed where? I told you! Up the alley. It went over a fence. I wasn't going to chase it with a stiff in the car. What for? "What for?" "What for"! Yeah. Find that monkey. Find it and get rid of it. WHITE: I certainly will if I see him. I don't know where he is any more than you do. Right. Goodbye. Listen, chief. Those fellas must think Superman works for the Daily Planet. What? Who? Washington. The Atomic Energy Commission. They want that Moleska formula. Oh. So do I. Have you seen Jim around? Ferguson sent him out on a story about an hour ago. Why? The rest of the staff's gone home. I wanted Jim to stand by in case anyone called about that monkey. I just made the news broadcast. There isn't a chance in a million anything will come of that. [RINGS] Perry White speaking. Hello, chief. I mean, Mr. White. Is Mr. Kent there? Just a minute. Speak of the devil. Jim? Yeah. Hello, Jim. Listen, Mr. Kent. Here's a funny thing. A kid phoned the office about an hour ago. He has one of our paper routes. He said there's a monkey in his alley. What! Where was this? Out in the Maywood section. Ferguson thought it might make a nice feature for the nature page so he sent me out on it. Where, Jim? And get this! The monkey's wearing a Superman costume. Listen to me, Jim. Exactly where is that monkey? Behind the 1300 block on Maywood Boulevard, in an alley. CLARK: Where are you now? In a drugstore, corner of 13th Place and Maywood. You get back to that monkey and hang onto him. Don't let him get away whatever you do, do you understand? Yeah, sure. Okay, I'll be there in a few minutes. Jim found the monkey. Great Caesar's ghost! I better get over there. I'll go with you. Have the girl on the switchboard call police headquarters. Trying to steal my monkey, huh? I ought to turn you kids out to the cops. Go on, now. Scram! Scram, I said! Hey! Where are you going with that monkey? What's it to you? It belongs to an organ grinder who got killed. You made a mistake, bud. Wait a minute. I'm from the Daily Planet. I got orders to watch that monkey. Give it here. Lookit, buster. Get smart and shove off. I will not! A wise guy, huh? [PEPI CHIRPING] [VEHICLE APPROACHING] Look at those cops down there. Yeah. MAX: Think they're looking for us? I don't know. But you should never have brought him in here. If you'd just had brains enough to get rid of that monkey. I told you. He got away... Oh, idiot. You sure nobody saw you lug him in? There was some kids around but I chased them. Frisch said he'd be late, huh? He said about 10:00. He has to wait for some guy. Well, maybe the cops will be gone by then. You stay here and watch him. But keep clear of the window. MAN: Murphy, you and Jones take the building on the corner. Rosen and Fry, take the one to the north. Healy, you come with me. I wonder where Jim is. Probably at a phone trying to reach us. I hope so. I told him to wait right here for me. MAN: Okay, Mr. Kent. We're all set. Thank you, sergeant. Okay, Pepi. Here's where you go to work. Kent, what the deuce are you up to? Watch. Up we go. Go on! It's working. Keep an eye on him. I'll be back. Hey, boss! Look. It's a plant. He's showing the cops where we are. Finish him. I'll take care of the reporter. [♪♪♪] You didn't get here a minute too soon. Are you all right? Weak but willing. The guy with the mustache has the Moleska formula. There it is. Golly! Now, Perry White and Inspector Henderson are down the street. You give this to them. And you'd better make a beeline for your office if you want to get a scoop on that story. Oh, gee, thanks! Just a minute. Miss Lane and Miss Moleska are both all right. Oh, swell. Hey, what happened to Pepi? [PEPI CHIRPING] [♪♪♪]
