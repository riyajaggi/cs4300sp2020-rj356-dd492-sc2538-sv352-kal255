 Adventures of Superman (1952–1958): Season 2, Episode 12 - Panic in the Sky - full transcript 
 Superman rams a giant asteroid on a collision course with Earth. The impact causes the asteroid to now orbit the planet. However, Superman is staggered as he returns to Earth. He manages to change back to Clark Kent (apparently a reflex action) but doesn't remember who he is. Meanwhile, the orbiting asteroid still presents hazards for Earth. Only Superman can place an explosive device that will demolish the asteroid -- and no one, including Clark, knows where Superman is.

MAN 3: It's Superman! NARRATOR: Yes, it's Superman, strange visitor from another planet, who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men.

 bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way.

It's just a meteor, that's all. Would you like to look through these night glasses, Miss Lane? No, thanks, Jim.

 It doesn't do any good. You can't see anything, anyway. You didn't find Mr. Kent, did you? No, sir. I'm sorry. Oh, that's all right. Clark probably found a nice deep cellar someplace to hide in. I'm sorry, I didn't really mean that. Nobody said that meteor's gonna hit Metropolis. Maybe it won't even hit the Earth. "Asteroid" is what the scientists are calling it. That's a meteor, king-size. Did you talk to the observatory? Mm. I wish we could see the blasted thing. At least last night we could see where it was. It's only flamed up like that when it's passed other planets. That's exactly what I meant before. It zoomed right past Venus and Mars, didn't it? Just because a big thing runs wild and gallops all over the solar system doesn't mean it's gonna hit us. I know, Jimmy. I know. Still... it does seem funny we can't see it anymore. That's because it's so close, it's in the shadow of the Earth. Chief, what did the observatory say? Measurements, just measurements. It's 5 miles and a quarter in diameter, they figure. Oh. Chief, do you wanna get out an extra on its size? With maybe an artist's drawing of it? Why bother? What do you mean, "why bother"? We might as well wait and print it with the morning wind-up story. If there is one. Gosh, but there's... Golly, that isn't daylight, is it? [♪♪♪] Any change, professor...? Out of the way. Superman! But the sky is getting... There isn't time. Where is Superman? Superman? Superman! Over here, professor. I'm just watching it. Well, your eyes probably do a better job of it than the telescope. It's stopped moving now. Well, it's turned from its course. And it's starting to burn again. You can't see it move because now it's coming straight toward us. Straight... Straight toward Metropolis? Yeah. Well, excuse me, professor. I've got a date in outer space. No, don't try it, Superman. Maybe I can knock it off its course. Now, listen, they've got spectroscopic photos in there, and we can't even identify the minerals and gases in that asteroid. So? Your powers may have no control over them. Here on Earth, yes. But suppose that's made of Kryptonite or some other unknown element from cosmic space, which even you can't handle. That's just a chance we'll have to take. Look. It's starting to fall now. It's picking up speed. Goodbye, professor. [SUPERMAN BLASTING OFF] Chance. That's all it is. Just a chance. And it may cost the world a terrible price... Superman. [♪♪♪] He did it. He did it! Its motion stopped entirely. It's just floating in space. Now it'll never hit the earth. It'll just float out there in its own orbit, like a second moon. It can't reach our atmosphere. Isn't that... right, professor? Isn't that what it means? I don't know. I don't know what it means, yet. Except that every single one of us owes his life to Superman. Hey, it's not so bright anymore. And it's changed direction. Hey, Mary! Quick! Look. Ah, it's gone. Hooray! [ALL CHEERING] [♪♪♪] [CAR MOTOR RUNNING] Hi. Whoa! Whoa, Nelly! Hey, stranger, you want a lift? Huh? I said do you want a lift? I guess so. Well, come on. Get in, then. Boy, oh, boy. D'you see that thing? Wow! "Zooooom," like this. Then "whap," she goes! What... did... you say? That planet thing up in the sky. I thought we was goners for sure. Superman done it. The radio said so. Superman? Yeah, yeah. Superman done it. All right, get in. Don't mean nothing to you. World gets saved. "Ha! Happens every day." Ha. Here's the front page, chief. Yes, that's right, from the White House. I could have told them Superman would come through. All right, professor. Yes, we'll be cautious, sure. The mayor, this is White again. Yes, I'll hang on. Huh? We're taking pictures on the roof. The asteroid's just circling the Earth. We've got to get it before it's out of sight. All right, sure. Yes, that's much better. I'll call you the minute we get in touch with him. Boy, what excitement. The mayor's planning a big reception for Superman. Yes, but... London observers wouldn't believe it was Superman who stopped it. What did Professor... In Rome, people are going crazy on the streets. Huh? Oh, the astronomer? He's a Gloomy Gus, that's all. Wondering about the effect of that thing after... But does he know what happened to Superman? No. They couldn't see what happened to him. After that terrific collision, do you think he could be dead? Mabel, is Clark Kent out there yet? I want him to get on the ball and find out what happened to Superman... Chief. He isn't back yet, either. Clark's still missing too. [♪♪♪] [FOOTSTEPS] [DOORKNOB RATTLES] Mr. Kent! Excuse me, please, I... Jeepers, where'd you go? I've been worried sick, what with you not coming to the office since last night and the chief yelling for you all the time, and all that stuff about Superman going on. I had these keys... It seemed like the right place to come to. I don't know. You're not mad at me for coming to your place, are you? No. The guy downstairs let me in, and I figured you wouldn't mind. [SIGHS] I don't know. What's the matter, Mr. Kent? Gee, you look tired. Tired. Yes... Yes, I'm tired. Well, it's no wonder, with all this excitement going on. I'll tell you what. Why don't you go and take a good hot shower. I'll run out and get some sandwiches and coffee. Shower? That's a good idea. I'll be back right away. [♪♪♪] [SHOWER RUNNING] I'm back, Mr. Kent. I got some coffee and sandwiches. I'll put them on the table in the bedroom. [GLASS SHATTERING] Mr. Kent. Here we are. [DOORBELL BUZZES] Wait a minute! [DOORBELL BUZZES] All right, where is he? What's this all about? He's in the bedroom. I finally got him in bed. He must weigh a ton. I guess he cracked his head pretty hard when he hit the floor. Jimmy, all that glass! I know. He must be the luckiest guy that ever lived. Not a scratch! Probably slipped on a piece of soap. Only why didn't you send for a doctor instead of us? Well, I... Please, I... I'm all right. What happened to me? Don't you know? Well, no. Not since I opened my eyes. I'm sorry. Are you all right, Mr. Kent? What? What did you call me? Mr. Kent. Who? What... What's the matter? Don't any of you know me? Please answer me. Who am I? Amnesia! He's lost his memory. Oh, nonsense! Kent, wake up. You're a reporter. You work for me! Now come on, stop this! Am I? A-are you sure? Who are you? Well, I'm Lois Lane, reporter at the Planet... Kent, I want you to stop this! Now, you can't lose your memory. It's not possible! You know us! I'm White. This is Jimmy. That's Lois. This is just a joke, isn't it, Clark? Of course that's all it is. But let me tell you one thing, young man: I'm in no mood for jokes. I've had all the headaches I want from all this asteroid business, Superman missing... Please. Just a minute. You said Superman? I seem to have heard of him before, somewhere. Who is Superman? Great Caesar's ghost! [♪♪♪] Professor. What are they gonna name it? Superman's Moon? Don't be stupid. What's eating you? It's settled down in its own orbit, hasn't it? Circling the earth twice a day, nice and steady. It's cooled off too. Oh, I developed those pictures for you, from the big lens. It's got a lot of little bumps on its surface. Looks just like it oughta look. Perfectly normal. I know, I know. Well, then what's wrong, professor? We're gonna find out soon enough. There's some government research men, a scientist and the Weather Bureau flying in this afternoon for a conference. If I'm not back, meet them, will you? Weather Bureau? Well, where are you going? To see Perry White at the Daily Planet. I think we should have Superman here at the conference. I'm afraid we'll need him. The Earth is still in deadly danger from that asteroid. [♪♪♪] [CAR HORN HONKS] You say this is where I work? Are you sure? Well, of course, Mr. Kent. Don't you remember anything? It's a big city, isn't it? Lots of big buildings. Guess the chief had the right idea. When you get behind your own desk and start pounding your old typewriter, you'll snap out of it. [♪♪♪] They say it's gonna cross the sun like that nearly every day? [CHUCKLING] Hm? What are you talking about? That's always been up there, hasn't it? It's what you call the moon, isn't it? That does it. In here! [CAR HORN HONKS] Doesn't anything come back to you, Mr. Kent? Look. There's the desk I fell against. Remember the day the chief was trying to find out who spilled the ink on his rug? No, I'm sorry, Jimmy. That is your name, isn't it? Kent! Kent! I wanna see you! Oh, that's me. Yes, sir? Oh, wait. Chief, it's hopeless. All you can do is get him a good doctor. I have no time for that! See there? Home again. Everything's gonna be all right. Nothing to worry about. Only this, Kent. I want you to find Superman for me. I don't care how you do it. You've done it for me before, so I want you to find him. Well, do you know what he looks like, sir? Now, see here, Kent. I told you, chief, it's useless. I'll help him, Mr. White. I was supposed to cover the flower show... Be quiet! Be quiet! Kent, the whole world needs him, don't you understand? They need him in a hurry! Why? What is it? You're the only one who's ever been able to contact him. You've got to find him! Well, sir, I'll do my best. I'll study up on him real hard, look all through the files downstairs, and uh... I'll ask everybody I meet and... How about putting an ad in the paper? That... No, no, no. I'm sorry. You just, uh... You just rest for a few days. You cover the flower show with Jimmy, while the world's coming to an end. Chief, what did you mean by the world coming to an end? Read this. Just came in on the wire. Tidal wave, down in Brazil. Oh, that's terrible. I'll get right on the story. Just a minute, Miss Lane. This tidal wave, I'm afraid, is just the beginning. Well, I don't understand. Does it have something to do with the asteroid that Superman stopped? Well, Superman just sidetracked it. That's the trouble. It should have been destroyed. Its gravitational influence is upsetting the Earth's rotation. I just had a call from our bureau in Cairo. North Africa is having the worst wind and sandstorm it's ever had. Well, the seismograph out at the observatory shows an earthquake. But we haven't determined its origin yet. You mean all these disturbances were caused by the asteroid? What other explanation can there be? That thing up there might disturb the balance of the entire solar system! I don't know. Just find Superman, do you understand? Find him. Where's Kent? He went home. I'm pretty worried about him, chief. You're worried about him? I'm worried about Superman. I guess we're all pretty worried about Superman. Well, we better be. If he doesn't turn up, we're finished, that's all. You're right. Oh, I sent Jimmy up to Clark's apartment to make sure he's all right. [♪♪♪] [DOOR OPENING] Okay to come in? Sure, Jimmy. Come on in. Are you feeling better? Hm? Oh, yes, thanks, Jimmy. I'm feeling much better, thanks. You look worried, Mr. Kent. Is something bothering you? Well, Jimmy, I've been thinking about Superman. Do you suppose it's his costume that gives him his peculiar power? I, uh... I don't follow you. You know what I mean. They haven't been able to find him, and they've got to. The world might not last another day. But suppose... Suppose someone else found his costume. No. No, wait, Mr. Kent That's not right. Superman explained it to me once. That costume doesn't have any particular powers. Only Superman can do super things. Nobody else. Nobody. Well, someone has gotta try and save this world of ours. Huh? Jimmy, you came over to see if I was all right. Well, I am. Thank you very much. Now if you don't mind running along, I've got some things to do. [♪♪♪] Professor Roberts. The observatory! [♪♪♪] Just this. It could save the world. But without Superman, it's useless. Couldn't the Army or the Navy or somebody put it in a guided missile and shoot it towards the asteroid? I'm afraid they haven't developed a guided missile yet that can go that far out into space. So the only answer is still Superman. Yeah, and nobody knows where he... Look! [♪♪♪] What can I do for you, professor? This box. Do you think you can carry this out to the asteroid? Yes, sir. Now, nothing can happen until you set the controls. After you reach the asteroid, throw the first switch. This one here? That's right. That'll start the chain reaction. Then 5 seconds later, throw the main switch. That does it. That's right. Now the atomic energy people are positive there's enough explosive in that to destroy the entire... [♪♪♪] Goodbye, professor. Miss Lane, everyone. You sound as though you don't expect to come back. I may not. You had a pretty rough time of it before. The asteroid was burning then. But since you changed its orbit, it's cooled. Now, perhaps the elements that almost destroyed you, were altered in the cooling process. I don't know. It's just a chance, nothing more. I understand, sir. [♪♪♪] Well... No matter who I am... Here goes. [♪♪♪] "Thus, the asteroid was completely disintegrated "and the world saved from possible destruction "due to its influence. "Superman, who was slightly injured "by his first collision in space, seemed to be "completely recovered when he returned to Earth. Probably it was the second blow that"... Wait a minute! How do you know all of that. Oh, didn't I tell you? I've my memory back again, now. Really, Clark. Just because you got hit on the head is no sign that's what happened to Superman. Why not? I think we have something in common. As a matter of fact, I know we do. You see, I know who he is now too. Oh, you do. Mm-hm. Well, come on, who? Oh, just knock me on the head sometime, you'll find out. Mr. Kent, I'm really very glad you're well again. But I'm not so sure it's much of an improvement. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
