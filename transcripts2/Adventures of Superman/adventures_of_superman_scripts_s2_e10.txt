 Adventures of Superman (1952–1958): Season 2, Episode 10 - The Face and the Voice - full transcript 
 Boulder, a thug, is recruited to participate in a scheme. Bouler undergoes plastic surgery to look like Superman and then is trained by a voice coach to sound like him. Wearing a Superman costume with a bullet-proof vest underneath, he intimidates merchants and others into giving up money. Yet, Boulder's boss has the bogus Superman donate the stolen money to charity. All of this causes great concern to Clark Kent, who's unsure whether he might be sleepwalking or not. Clark gets reassurance when he finds out the phony Superman makes an appearance while the reporter was elsewhere. Now, the real Superman intends to put an end to this caper.

 bend steel in his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a never-ending battle for truth, justice and the American way. And now, another exciting episode in the Adventures of Superman! [♪♪♪] I ain't gonna do it! But, Boulder, you just promised you would do it. Well, all right, so I changed my mind already. How do I know it ain't gonna hurt? Yeah, that's right. How do I know it ain't gonna hurt? Twenty-five thousand dollars. And don't be silly.

 You heard the doctor promise he wouldn't hurt you. Yeah, now, what if it don't work though? I'm the guy who takes all the risk, and that put in all the time. That doctor's gonna take knives and hurt me and everything. It's all yours, Boulder. Keep it. And when we get ready for the big deal, I'll give you 10 percent of everything we get. You'll get millions. Gee, boss, how's your plan gonna work? Come on, tell us about it. Be quiet, Scratchy. Mr. Fairchild, you just bought yourself a boy. Ain't much of a face, anyway. I'll do it. I knew I could count on you. [♪♪♪] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn Hi. Are you looking for someone? Huh? Oh, uh, sure. This editor guy. This Mr. White, that's all. Oh, I think he's gone home. But you might ask the night watchman. No, no, no. He told me to wait. Gotta pick up a pair of shoes. See, he's got a hole in one of his shoes. I fix things like that, see. Told me to wait. Oh, sure. Hey, boss! Boss, look. I got it! See, it says, "Speech by..." Hey, Boulder. Hiya, Scratchy-boy. Hey, kick the doc, will you? Make him hurry up. The suspense is killing me. And your speech is killing me, Boulder. That comes next, you know. We're not ready for the big deal until we do something about that awful voice of yours. Ah, you and your big deals. Dry up, already. I've hired the best voice coach I could find. He's got real class too, even though he did spend a stretch in San Quentin. Will you shut up? Hurry up, doc, will you? I want to hurry up and see my new kisser! What's the matter, Boulder? Haven't you any faith in plastic surgery? Oh, wait. I've got a T-shirt here for you. I'll get it. There you are. Hold this up in front of you. Gee. Dig me, will you? Just like Superman. How about that? [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] I just thought I'd mention it, chief. Well, then, why didn't you take more notice of him? And don't call me chief! I don't even know if it's the right one. Well, then why bring it up at all? It's not that important. Oh, wait a minute. W-what's the matter? Somebody robbed my personal files last night, that's all. This young genius here says he knows who the thief was, but he doesn't know who it was. I see. Well, what was taken? Remember that speech Superman made last 4th of July? Mm-hmm. Well, somebody stole the recording of it. Nothing else. That's peculiar. Jimmy, um... did you see someone that might have taken it? Oh, I don't even know if it's the right man, Mr. Kent. I couldn't even describe him. Just a funny little guy, that's all. Well, you let me know if you see him again. Yes, sir. If I do. Why would anyone want a recording of Superman's voice? I don't get it. Neither do I, junior. Neither do I. [RECORD HISSES] SUPERMAN: Ladies and gentlemen of Metropolis, Um... Ladies and gentlemen, uh... No, no, no, Boulder. "Gentlemen." You're not being very cooperative. Ah. Come on, now. Give me your vocal exercises. All right. Um... Roll on, thou deep And dark blue ocean Ah, that's Shakespeare? Around and round the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran. Now, repeat it after me. You're kidding. No, repeat. Around and around the rugged rocks the ragged rascal ran. [TALKS WITH METRONOME] I look like Superman. Why don't I sound like Superman? I look like Superman. Why don't I sound like Superman? I look like Superman. Why don't I [YELLS] sound like Superman?! I look like Superman. Why don't I sound like Superman? I look like Superman. Why don't I... That's it, Boulder, it's coming along fine. I look like Superman... Ladies and gentlemen of Metropolis. Good evening, Inspector Henderson. Madam, may I help you across the street? Young man, I would not play with those matches if I were you. Little lady, may I ask you... Never mind, that's enough! Hamlet, you're a genius. You've done it. Yeah! Dig that diction. My own brother wouldn't recognize me. I mean, uh... Boulder, you embarrass me. Ha-ha, that's all right, Boulder. You've done beautifully. Now, I think it's finally time for the big deal. And all them millions, huh? No. First we have to run a little test, just to get the ball rolling. Don't worry, boss. I'm ready for anything. I got the build and the voice, and... There's one thing that bothers me, though. About them bullets that is supposed to bounce off me. Ah, don't give it another thought, Boulder. I've got that figured out too. I should hope so. [♪♪♪] Superman. Yes. May I have all your money, please. What? Yeah. I-I mean, yes. I must have all the money in your cash register. Well... Well... sure. I-if you need it. Only... could you give me a receipt? I mean... Thank you. I know that you'll bring it back. Only... [DOOR SLAMS] Superman. Holy cow. "Superman turns supercrook. Robs store of $165." Oh, chief, it just can't be true. It must be a hoax of some kind. Must be some new type of publicity. Jeepers, you don't think Superman would actually go out and steal from somebody. I know it's not true. But look, every paper in town has published it, except us. And where there's smoke, there's some kind of fire. Well, I'm going down and talk to that clerk myself. I think he just made it up. I'll bet he stole that money himself! Well, what are you waiting for? I want to print the truth! All right! But you say you didn't see him fly. That's right, Mr. Kent. I didn't see him fly. But it was Superman. I recognized his face and his voice. And he had muscles. I was standing here, and he came in and demanded the money. Naturally, I gave it to him. I see. Thank you very much. Hey, what did you find out, Mr. Kent? Well, I talked to the man, I talked to his wife. In fact, I talked to everybody. It happened, all right. He was there. I don't understand. But there's one thing that bothers me. He didn't see Superman fly. He saw him walk away with the money. Then that guy last night must have been a fake. I know he was a fake. Probably some small-time crook that was using a costume instead of a gun. I found something interesting right here in the society column of our own paper. Look, read where I marked it. Oh, yeah. That is interesting, Jimmy. "Allied Women's Charities also announced the receipt "of $165 from an anonymous donor this morning." That was the same amount that was taken from the store. Yes, sir. Maybe a coincidence. But if it's not, that makes it all the more confusing. What do you mean? Well... to rob a place, and then give the money to charity. Why would a crook do that? Sounds more to me like the real Superman might have. Oh, just a minute, Jimmy. That's ridiculous! I happen to know that Superman was home in bed last night. [♪♪♪] Did he hit you? Did he hit me? That bulletproof vest? It worked out, huh? It worked out in a pig's eye. Uh, you're okay, ain't you, Boulder? No, I ain't, "okay, ain't you, Boulder." And will you shut up. Get lost. Okay, Boulder. Well, as quick as that, huh? Yes, "as quick as that, huh." Look here, where I stopped a slug in the back. Well, I got news for you. I ain't no Superman. And it hurts. Didn't that bulletproof vest I bought you... No, it did not. Furthermore, suppose somebody should slip me a slug in the head. I got news for you. As of now, I am resigning. I've had enough. Nobody's gonna shoot at you again, Boulder. You and your big, fat ideas! I mean it. We'll arrange it so they won't. Here, let me see those. Oh, no. There's rocks here that are worth over a thousand clams. Boulder, you're giving it all to charity again. Hah! That's the next step. You'll see how well it all works out tomorrow. I just told you: I am through. Of course. And you wouldn't be interested that tomorrow, the Metropolis Reserve Bank is handling a gold bullion shipment worth, uh, 2 million dollars. No, I would not. Did you say 2 million dollars? And I promise you, you don't have to give a nickel to charity. Well, in that case, boss, I am very sorry. Here. Two million dollars. You know, boss, there's just one thing that worries me. It's about this Superman. The real one, I mean, uh... You know, he's not a punk like me. He's a very tough character. And I'm worried about what he might decide to do about all this. Who knows? However, I think we've put him in a spot where he'll be pretty busy with his own problems. In fact, I think the real Superman... will soon be convinced that he's going crazy. [LAUGHS] The watchman, who said he was confused by being thrown to the floor, actually fired his gun at Superman, but, of course, it had no effect on the man of steel. Why Superman should have taken the jewelry is a complete mystery. But why did he take money from a store, and then, as some people are guessing, turn it over to charity? [CONTINUING ON RADIO] The police have no explanation. But they ask everyone to remain calm in the face of his strange, inexplicable behavior until... [TURNS RADIO OFF] [KNOCKING] Did you see the morning papers? Yes, Jimmy. In fact, I was just on my way down to Inspector Henderson's right now. But they got pictures and even an eyewitness this time. One guy even saw him leap into the air after it was over. A street photographer, he saw him fly. What's that? You say they took a picture? Honest, he saw Superman. It must have been the real one. I'm on my way to interview the guy right now. Oh, now, Jimmy. It's impossible. Other man can't do things like that. And Superman just doesn't run around in his sleep. At least I don't think he does. See what I mean? It's him, isn't it? I don't think he walks in his sleep. What's the matter, Mr. Kent? Don't you feel well this morning? Mr. Kent? Huh? Oh, I-I'm sorry, Jimmy. Maybe you'd better roll along without me, huh. Okay. [RINGS DOORBELL] Yeah, buddy? Hello. I'm a reporter for the Daily Planet. I came to interview you about that, uh... Oh, say no more, sonny. Don't I know you? I was the eyewitness, see. You want to hear the story, huh? Well... by trade, I'm a street photographer, see. And last night it just so happens I'm over near that jewelry store and, uh... The phonograph record. Huh? Oh, never mind. Go on. Well, do you want to hear this story or not? Everybody else in town does. Yeah, sure I do. Okay. Well, I was over by the... Hey, just a minute. You're that kid I saw... Yeah, boss. But what will I do with him? Oh, I told you it was crazy, me coming right out in public claiming I saw Boulder fly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But how soon will you pick him up? [SIGHS] Sometimes, you and your big deals, I get scared. Boulder what? Where? You mean he is right now? Ah. Then you can ditch the kid pretty quick, huh? Good. Yeah. It's almost over. [♪♪♪] Now, you're certain you understand, Mr. White? Yes, I understand. I'm to give them to the Metropolis charity for the homeless. And you're not to worry. Everything will go to charity. Yes. I'll... I'll print just what you said. Goodbye, Mr. White. Wait a minute, Superman. You know, this doesn't seem like you. It doesn't sound like you. What do you mean? Now, don't take offense, but the idea of you playing Robin Hood, stealing from one person, giving to another... Are you insinuating that everything I "borrow" will not be given to charity? No, of course not. Of course not. But don't you see how wrong that is? You've always worked with the police, upheld law and order. You've never taken anything from anyone, but... Well, you should hear what people are saying about you now. Listen to me, please, Superman. You haven't considered what the consequences will be. Mr. White... have you ever considered what the consequences would be if I were to get angry at Metropolis? Great Caesar's ghost. Come on, let's get outta here. I'm shaking like a leaf. It was fine, Boulder. I listened at the door. Everything was great. Great, was it? I sure cooked that Superman's goose. Come on, let's get out of here. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. It's perfectly ridiculous, Clark. You're as healthy as... Well, as Superman. That's not funny, Tom. Ah, now, don't be touchy. All I meant is that you're in great shape. I wish I was half as sure of it as you seem to be. Look... I'm a doctor, right? Right. And I'm also a very good friend of yours, correct? Of course you're a good friend of mine, Tom. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come here in the first place. Well, that's exactly the point. I'm your doctor and your friend. And yet you won't take my word for it that nothing on earth is the matter with you. Nothing on Earth? Hmm. Tom, is it possible... I mean, do you think something could have affected my mind? Your mind? [LAUGHS] Not a chance. Why, your reflexes are magnificent. You've got a superb mind. Yes, but is it possible? I mean, could I have done something without knowing that I'd done it? What sort of thing? Well, like stealing, for instance. Clark, what are you talking about? You know you're not capable of doing any such thing. But... What I'm trying to say is... suppose, for example... I went to sleep. And then I... I walked in my sleep. And I awoke without knowing anything about it. Well, I think it's very unlikely that you would do anything walking in your sleep that you wouldn't do under ordinary circumstances. But it is possible, isn't it? Well... it's possible, but... [SCOFFS] Look, Clark... why don't you take a vacation? Maybe you've been working too hard. So, there is something wrong with me? Well, why didn't you tell me about it? Now, wait a minute. I still say... there's nothing wrong with you physically or mentally, except that... well, you've got some crazy idea that... Crazy idea? I heard you say that, Doc. All right, so I used the wrong word. What I mean is you're talking yourself into a condition that just doesn't exist. [SIGHS] Well, I hope so. I sincerely hope so. And thanks, doc, for putting up with me. Chief, what's going on? I just passed the mayor out in the hall. Kent, there's nothing we can do. Any of us. We've issued orders not to arrest him or cross him in any way. Who? Who are you talking about? Superman, of course. Oh, come on. Kent, it's horrible. He's losing his mind. That's the only explanation. Chief, you know that's not possible. Kent, don't talk nonsense. Can you prove he's not crazy? Are you Superman? But, chief, you know him. How could you believe such a thing? Because I saw him here with my own eyes, not a half an hour ago. That's all. Kent, where are you going? Never mind. I've wasted too much time already. [♪♪♪] You comfortable? Won't be much longer. Time's just about up. Your time too. Such a beautiful plan. Two million dollars is the prize. [♪♪♪] Look, Inspector... Superman. Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I'm not going to bite you. We've got work to do, and fast. Of course you wouldn't bite anyone. Now, just sit down and relax. Look, you don't seem to understand. I'm the real Superman! Here, look. Convince you? Of course you're the real Superman. I'd lock anybody up that said different. And I've always admired you too. Bill, there's a crook loose in this city. He looks exactly like me. There's a phonograph record of my voice stolen. There may even have been plastic work done on him. Please, hold it, will you? There's nothing to get excited about. This may be building up to some huge crime. Now, now, now. Now, we know all about it. Now, Perry White talked to you. I've known him for years. I believe him. We have some very nice doctors coming to see you... Look, Bill, we've been pals for years. I'd hate to use you for a volleyball in your own office, but... [PHONE RINGS] Henderson. What?! He was... No. I mean, yes! Right away. The Metropolis Bank. Two million dollars in gold bullion was just... And they just stood there because it was Superman. Ah! I mean, it was... Holy cow. You see what I mean? Well... what did you actually see? Only the getaway, sir. It was the most thrilling thing you ever saw. I saw Superman, all by himself, and the truck. And he went driving down towards the Planet building. I suppose, to give the money back. It was wonderful. But he wasn't just driving, you know. I saw him pick up the truck in his hand, and he went leaping through the air. Like... Like... Like what? [MOANS] That man's just a stooge, inspector. What? That's right. His job is to send you in the wrong direction. I'll see you later. Come with me. [♪♪♪] Good. You made it, Boulder. Sure. Well, let's get it. Give me one. Here. [♪♪♪] All right, Boulder, get in with him. Okay, boss. Boulder, I told you to stay in the back, keep an eye on the boy. You did? I didn't think we'd get rid of him till we get across the border. It's just a short ways. So you're the big boss? You're not complaining, are you, Boulder? We've left Scratchy and Hamlet behind. So maybe we'll forget to send them their share too, huh? You seem to have things pretty well worked out, don't you? What's the matter, Boulder? You afraid I'm gonna give you the shake too? Well, you're right. And this looks like as good a place as any. You've always been worried about somebody missing that steel vest of yours, haven't you? Well, here's one for that phony face of yours, Boulder. [GUN FIRES REPEATEDLY] The real one! No! [BLOWS] Go on, get out of here, will you? Leave me alone. [CHUCKLES] Oh, no. You'll have policemen around you for quite some time. Also, around Fairchild and the rest of your gang. Yeah, I should have known. [SCOFFS] I seen prison walls the minute I took this job. Say, inspector, do me a favor, will you? What is it? Well, will you get me a doc and tell him to make with the plastic surgery. Only this time, I want my own face back. I was happy with that. I was living with it. Be glad to. Yeah. I should have known. Takes more than a face and a voice. There's only one real Superman. He can say that again. Right, Mr. Kent? Right, Mr. Olsen. [♪♪♪]
