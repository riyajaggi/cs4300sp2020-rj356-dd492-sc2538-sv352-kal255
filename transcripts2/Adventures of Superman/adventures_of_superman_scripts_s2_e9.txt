 we'll never get your dog out. A simple thing I ask you. Stop the car and take the dog for a walk. So where does he walk? Right smack into the bottom of a well. Can I help it if you got a stupid dog? Ooh... You should mention stupid. And you know something else? I don't think he walked in. I think you pushed him. Aah, chicken, how can you say anything like that? Because it's true. That's why I say it. Didn't you? Didn't you push him? Didn't you. All right, all right. So I give him a little shove, maybe. I think maybe he's thirsty. Ooh. How could I marry such a hammerhead? [FAINT BARKING] Corky. Corky! WOMAN: Corky. Corky! Can't you do something? Corky. Corky. Corky. Corky. [DOG BARKING] Ooh! Can't you do something? He'll drown down there. MAN: Lady, we're trying to save your dog, but there just ain't no way. WOMAN: Corky. Corky. Corky. Corky? Poor Corky. Just wait'll I get you home. Home, you call it. I'd be better off in a kennel. That mangy mutt gets more attention than I do. I hope he drowns. [♪♪♪] If I've told you once, I've told you a hundred...

Corky, baby. That dress cost me 200 clams. I oughta send Superman a bill for helping you ruin it. Oh, shut up and put his leash on. [GRUMBLES] Come on, Corky, baby. You just stay here with me. [BARKING] Quiet, Corky! Just a minute, baby. That's a good boy. He doesn't like you anymore, either. Orders, orders. That's all we got to do. WOMAN: Oh, shut up and let's go. What's the matter with you, you crazy mutt? Stop picking on him! Think I never seen a glove before? Oh, throw that dirty thing away and let's go. MAN: Oh, gosh. You're always telling me what to do. [WIND HOWLING] [LOCK RATTLING] Hey, boss, where you been? He's been out trying to drown a dog. That's where he's been. You mean Corky? Boss, you shouldn't have done a thing like that. Don't tell me what I shouldn't have done. Oh, lay off. Real big guy, you. You're afraid to pick on anybody but Louie and Corky here. Who's afraid? You're afraid. Yeah? How did I get control of the biggest bookie syndicate in Metropolis? Want me to tell ya? Well, uh... I'll tell ya, anyway. Before he died, my old man used to run the syndicate. You married the boss's daughter. That's how you got control. Gee, just like in the movies. Shut up, stupid. I didn't marry the boss's daughter. I married the boss's daughter's dog. Leave him alone, you big brute. Someday Corky's gonna bite you. Only he's afraid of getting hydrophobia. Did he hurt you, baby? Come on, lie down for a minute. You come on. Get in your bed, Corky. Now, lie down. Mommy's gonna get you a nice, big bone. You stay right there. Louie, open the door. And let all the flies in? Open the door. [QUIETLY] Go on, beat it! [BARKING] You know, boss, sometimes I don't think you like the little pup dog. Not sometimes. All the times I don't like him. Now, here we are, Corky... Hey! Where's Corky? Baby, this time it ain't my fault. You left the door open when you come in. You mean to say you let him get away again? Corky! Why didn't you watch him? Why didn't you watch him? I can't watch him all the time. You get one more chance, see? Just one. I want you to go put an ad in the "Lost and Found." I want it in every paper in town. In the Planet. In the Blade. Every paper in town! But, baby, it's gonna cost money for me to do that. Move. And if I don't see that ad in the paper by tomorrow... Yeah, I know, I know. This wouldn't have happened if the dog was a canary. [♪♪♪] [BARKS] [LAUGHING] Take it easy, Corky. Take it easy. I like you, too, but this could be very hard to explain. It certainly could. Maybe the animals are starting a "Be Kind to Human Beings" week. Uh, yes. That could be. Get down, boy. Get down. Oh, Clark, how can you be so mean? Do you suppose he thinks you're somebody else? Oh, could be. Go on home, boy. Now, go on. Go home. [BARKS] Clark, he took one of your gloves. He's welcome to it, if he just leaves peaceably. I lost the other one, anyway. Clark, how can you be so utterly heartless? Lois, you don't understand. You wanna know something, Mr. Kent? At this point, no. I don't think you're rid of that little dog by a long shot. Corky! Come here, Corky. Nice Corky. Come on, Corky. Nobody's gonna hurt ya. [BARKING] Well, did you do it? Did you put the ad in? Not yet, baby. Not yet? Hey, what's the matter with you? I got a better idea, honey. Well, it better be a lot better, honey. I'm gonna offer a reward. Five thousand dollars. Five thousand bucks? What is this? Dogs have sure gone up. Hank, you're up to something. If it's gonna hurt Corky... You want the dog back or don't you? Sure, I want my dog back! Okay. Louie... Yeah. You got yourself a job. Go out and spread the word around. Five thousand bucks for the mutt. Tell all the boys, everybody. Spread it around, understand? Sure, boss. Five thousand bucks for the dog. I think I got it. I got it. You know, honey. Sometimes I think maybe I got you all wrong. You sure have, chicken. And I'm gonna prove it. [♪♪♪] [RINGS] Kent speaking. Mr. Kent, this is Louie. Louie? Yeah. You don't know me, but I know all about you. You do people favors. That's why I'm calling. Got something to tell you about a dog. A dog? Well, what is it, Louie? Well, my boss told me to spread the word around. And I figured the best way to do it was for you to write a story. What, uh, kind of a story? About the $5000 reward. That's what he'll pay to get the dog back. Uh, Louie, who is this boss of yours, and, uh, what kind of a dog was it? Well, he's a little, furry dog. He almost got drowned in a well, except he was saved by Superman. Uh, Louie, I'll tell you what. You better come over here to the office. Tell me the story, and we'll see what we can do about it. Maybe I better. I get confused on telephones, and sometimes I run out of dimes. I'll come right over. Well, fine, Louie. I'll be waiting for you. Lois, what would you say if I told you that little dog is worth $5000? I'd say you were crazy. So would I, but that's the story. [CORKY BARKING] Hello, boy. Quick, Mr. Kent, go have him turned into traveler's checks. Well, where did you come from? [BARKS] Well, that clears that up. Well, what'd you do, boy? Swallow the crown jewels? Just what I thought. What are you gonna do with him, Clark? I don't know, Lois. But I'm not gonna give him to anyone till I find out what this is all about. Maybe I could take him home with me for a couple days. No, Jimmy. I'm afraid that's too obvious. They might connect us with him. Better take him to a private kennel. Maybe you're right. Come on, fella. We gotta find a hideout for you. You know, Clark. I've got a feeling you're frightened about something. Don't be silly, Lois. What possible harm could a little dog do to me? Excuse me. Sure, pardon me. Hey, you! Drop that dog. [DOGS WHINING] HANK: What did you guys do, steal every mutt in town? And you, this is your third time around, and you ain't brung the right dog yet. Go on, beat it. All of ya. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Hey, boss. Boss. Well, did you find the dog? Yeah. I found him. So where is he? I lost him again. You what? Now, wait, boss. I was in front of the Daily Planet, when this kid comes out carrying Corky. I chased him, but he got away. What was you doin' in front of the Daily Planet? Just like you told me. I was spreading the word. And Mr. Kent was gonna write me up a big story. Kent? The reporter? Yeah. That was using my head. Huh, boss? Yeah. It was using it. But I don't know for what. Come on. We gotta work fast. Got a few minutes, son? Yes, sir. I've got all the minutes you want. Then turn around and walk over to that car. It's a little large, isn't it? Okay, Move it. LOUIE: That's sure smart of the boss, hooking the kid to that lie-detector machine. [HUMS] Where do you live? JIMMY: North side. What's your name? Herman Glockenspiegel. That's a lie! You're right. My name's Archie Glockenspiegel. Where did you take the dog? To Bermuda. Did you take him home? No. How long you been working for the Planet? Forty-seven years next Tuesday. Did you take the dog to a private kennel? JIMMY: No. Was it on the south side? No. Was it on the... north side? No. The one on Melrose? No. Was it the one on Willow Street? No. The one on Harper? No. Louie. One of the canine kennels on Harper Street. Corky's there. Get him. Sure, boss. But ain't you gonna tell us why you want him so bad? Yeah, why? Because that dog is gonna lead me right to Superman. Superman. You're nuts. Listen, remember how crazy he was about Superman? Yeah. Remember that glove I found by the well? I guess so. Just take a good look at this one. Looks like the mate. Still think I'm crazy, huh? Well, I'm betting 5000 bucks that this belongs to Superman. And Corky knows where to find him. WOMAN: What if he does? What good's that gonna do you? LOUIE: I'll tell you what good. As soon as I find out who Superman really is, his real identity, I make him a deal. I keep it a secret. He promises to lay off my syndicate. Get it? You know, honey, even my old man would be proud of you today. Well, get going. What's holding you back? Nothing. Nothing, boss. I'll get the little pup dog. Yeah, and be sure you bring him back. What about him? Don't worry, chicken. I got plans. Boss? Yeah, I got the pup dog. Right here in a bag. Okay, okay. Sure, boss. I'm sorry, little dog, but I gotta do it. [PHONE RINGS] Kent speaking. Oh, Louie? Sure, send him right in. Oh, hello. You must be the man that phoned that dog story in. Yeah, but you don't have to worry about that no more. I took care of it. Oh, you took care of it? Sure, I'm not so smart, but I ain't dumb enough to get mixed up with Superman. Sup... Superman, huh? What's he got to do with it? My boss was gonna use the dog to lead him to Superman. Oh, and that's what you took care of? Sure. I know you're a friend of Superman's. But you can tell him he's got nothing to worry about anymore. The little dog is never gonna help the boss find out who Superman really is. And just who is this boss of yours? Oh, I couldn't tell you that. I'll be in enough trouble as it is, if he ever finds me. Mm-hm. What'd you do with the dog? Uh, he won't know nothing, Mr. Kent. They'll just put him to sleep, and then nobody will ever know the secret of Superman. I said, what'd you do with that dog? You ain't gonna double-cross Superman, are you? Just tell me what you did with that dog! I... I put him in the dog catcher's wagon about 20 minutes ago. It was down on Center Street. [DOGS BARKING] Superman! What are you doing here? Well, that brown dog, that little one right there, doesn't belong in there. Why don't you leave dog catching to the dogcatchers. But you didn't catch this one. Someone must have put him in there. Besides, he's got a license. Eh! Yeah, you're right. He has. So you can give him to me without breaking any rules. Well, I guess I can. You know, you can't even run a peaceful dog-catching business anymore. [BARKING AND SHOUTING] Doggy, doggy, doggy! Doggy! Well, Corky. Hello. You know, for a little dog, you certainly caused a lot of trouble for one day. Clark, I thought Jimmy took him to a kennel. Oh, he was supposed to. Incidentally, where is Jimmy? Well, I don't know. Don't you? Clark Kent, what are you up to? Nothing, Lois. Nothing at all. What's wrong with a man owning a dog? For some very mysterious reason, this dog happens to be worth $5000. And I think you know why. Oh, Lois. Will you do me a favor? Watch the dog for me. I'll be back in an hour. Where are you going? Out. I've got some things to attend to. I wanna get some dog food too. With that kind of a price on your head, you should at least be able to speak. What gives with you and Clark? Ah, so you won't talk, eh? Mr. Kent, I... This dog must be twins. And where have you been? That's what I wanna talk to Mr. Kent about. Oh, he just left. Didn't you see him? Oh! I must've passed him on the elevator! He'll be gone for over an hour. What happened, Jim? Tell me. Well, I don't know everything. But after I took the pooch here to a kennel, I was kidnapped. Kidnapped? By whom? I don't know. I was blindfolded all the time. But they took me someplace, asked me a lot of questions, and somehow they found out what they wanted to know. But how did you get back here? Well, they figured I couldn't identify them or didn't know where I was, so they dumped me out in the country. If you only knew where they took you. I think I do. But you said you were blindfolded. I was. But if my hunch is right... Come here, fella. Here's his license number. Phone the police. Trace the owner of this dog. Find out where he lives. I'll bet the guy that owns this dog is the same guy that kidnapped me. Jim, you have just been elected for the Genius of the Month Club. Police? JIMMY: This must be the place. Somewhere on the second floor. Hey, I bet the pooch here could show us the exact apartment. Well, you stay in the car 'cause they'd recognize you. So, what do you do? So I merely return a lost dog. Any news I pick up in the process, pure gravy. Uh, pardon me, but... Corky boy! Oh, boy, Corky. How glad... Oh, uh, excuse me, miss. But, uh... It's just that I'm so glad to see him again. You know how it is. Uh, not exactly, but I'd like to find out. I'm Lois Lane of the Daily Planet. How'd you know where to bring him? Oh, I heard about the reward. I ran across the dog and just took a chance. Actually, he led me to the door. Okay. I'll send you a check to the office. I'd much rather have the story, on why you want the dog back so much. Okay, go ahead in. Thanks. There you are, miss. [BARKS] Everything's ready for his homecoming. Nothing but the best. Does that answer your question? Frankly, no. Look, lady. I'm fond of this mutt. I love him. It's as simple as that. He's just like my own canine brother. You can buy an awful lot of canine brothers for $5000. Look. You wanted a story, lady. That's it. I'd advise you to get back to your office and write it. But I... I said beat it. Now that you put it that way, perhaps I'd better leave. [WHINING] What'd you find out? Just a name and a bad feeling. Anyway, we've got something to bargain with Mr. Kent for what he knows. Me, I might as well still be blindfolded. Come on, now, Corky, boy. Do your stuff. You're gonna lead me right to Superman. Only this time, we're gonna find out who Superman is in real life. Now, go on, bloodhound. [BARKS] What do you see, Corky? Where is he? Where is he, Corky? Go on! Are we getting close, Corky? Are we getting close? There's nobody here. What are you trying to do, you stupid mutt? Find Superman. Go on. [CORKY BARKING] What's the matter? You wanted to find Superman, didn't you? Now you have. Yes, but I... I didn't wanna find him this way. I... It might have worked at that, if it hadn't been for Corky. He warned me by barking. I knew I couldn't trust you, you stupid mutt. Ugh! [CORKY BARKING FIERCELY] Let go, will ya? Get her off of me! Anything you say, my friend. [SCREAMS] HANK: Aah! Somebody help! Come here. Come on, boy. Looks like he's gonna be hung up for a while. I... You can't leave me up here! Get me down from here! Don't worry. There'll be a couple of policemen along. And they'll let you down real soon. Come on, Corky. Shall we go? CLARK: You know, Corky. Hank's gonna be in jail a long time for trying to kidnap Jimmy. So he won't be around to bother you. Joyce loves you. She'll take good care of you. But I can't keep you, pal, because you're the only one in the whole world that knows Superman's true identity. And that's a secret we have to keep between the two of us. Don't we? [BARKS] So be a pal, will you, and go on home. Much as I'll hate to lose you. We'll just keep it between us, huh, Corky? Go on home, boy. [WHINES] What's the matter, Clark? You look as though you lost your best friend. Maybe I have, Lois. Maybe I have. [♪♪♪]
