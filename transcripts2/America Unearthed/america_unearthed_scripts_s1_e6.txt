 - ALL RIGHT, FOLKS, HERE'S SOME PRETTY BIG NEWS FOR A TINY TOWN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. TURNS OUT THE STE STRUCTURES ON MALCOLM PEARSON'S PROPERTY DOWN IN SALEM MIGHT BE OLDER THAN PEOPLE THINK. SOME ARE SAYING THEY COULD BE OLDER THAN CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS HIMSELF. NOW, THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING. BUT I GUESS WE NEED TO WAIT AND SEE. IN SPORTS,

 THE RED SOX FACED THE YANKEES LAST NIGHT AT FENWAY IN THE FIRST OF A THREE-GAME SERIES. - THE HISTORY THAT WE WERE ALL TAUGHT GROWING UP IS WRONG. MY NAME IS SCOTT WOLTER, AND I'M A FORENSIC GEOLOGIST. THERE'S A HIDDEN HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY THAT NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT. THERE ARE PYRAMIDS HERE... CHAMBERS, TOMBS, INSCRIPTIONS. THEY'RE ALL OVER THIS COUNTRY. WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE THESE ARTIFACTS AND SITES, AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE TRUTH. SOMETIMES HISTORY

 ISN'T WHAT WE'VE BEEN TOLD. AMERICA UNEARTHED - SEASON 1 EP - 6 - Stonehenge in America STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND IS ONE OF THE MOST AWE-INSPIRING ANCIENT SITES ON EARTH. EVEN TODAY, ITS ORIGIN AND PURPOSE REMAIN SHROUDED IN MYSTERY. ONE THING ARCHAEOLOGISTS KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT ITS CONSTRUCTION TOOK OVER 2,000 YEARS. ONE THING THEY DON'T KNOW IS WHO BUILT IT. THERE'S NO DOUBT THE SITE, ORIGINALLY COMPRISED OF SOME 150 STONES, WAS THE WORK OF SOME ADVANCED CIVILIZATION THAT KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT THE SUN, MOON, AND STARS TO ALIGN THESE STONES WITH THE HEAVENS IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY. BUT WHAT IF I TOLD YOU WE HAVE OUR VERY OWN STONEHENGE IN THE UNITED STATES? AND THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THE TWO SITES WERE BUILT BY THE SAME PEOPLE. I'M ON MY WAY TO INVESTIGATE IT RIGHT NOW. AMERICA'S STONEHENGE IS A PREHISTORIC SITE IN SALEM, NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE OWNER SAYS THE STONE STRUCTURES HERE DATE BACK 4,000 YEARS. I GOT A CALL FROM HIS SON, KELSEY. HE'S DISCOVERED A SOLAR ALIGNMENT, AN EXAMPLE OF ARCHAEOASTRONOMY THAT HE WANTS ME TO SEE. - SO THIS IS THE CENTRAL OBSERVATORY. THIS IS WHAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT, WHY WE CALL IT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE. - JUST LIKE AT STONEHENGE, SOMEONE PLACED STANDING STONES, LARGE, VERTICAL ROCKS, IN A CIRCLE. THE PLACEMENT IS KEY. WHEN VIEWED FROM THE CENTER OF THE SITE, EACH STANDING STONE LINES UP WITH THE SUN ON IMPORTANT DAYS OF THE YEAR. THE SOLSTICES, THE LONGEST AND SHORTEST DAYS, THE EQUINOXES, WHEN THE SUN IS ON A LEVEL PLANE WITH THE EARTH'S EQUATOR, AND THE CROSS-QUARTER DAYS, WHICH FALL MID-WAY BETWEEN THEM. - THIS IS THE SUMMER SOLSTICE SUNRISE STONE. SO ON SUMMER SOLSTICE, THE SUN BASICALLY JUST RISES RIGHT OVER THERE, RIGHT OVER THE STONE, JUST KIND OF C AND THEN JUST KIND OF TRACKS ACROSS THE S. AND THEN ON THE SUNSET, IT JUST COMES RIGHT OVER TO... - RIGHT OVER HERE? - SUMMER SOLSTICE SUNSET STONE THERE. - YOU REALIZE THIS SAYS AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT YOUR SITE. WHOEVER WAS HERE IS MARKING THESE IMPORTANT DATES OF THE YEAR, LIKE MANY ANCIENT CULTURES ALL OVER THE WORLD DID. I'VE BEEN SEEING THIS A LOT LATELY. IT'S CALLED ARCHAEOASTRONOMY. IT'S HOW ANCIENT CULTURES USED THE SUN, MOON, STARS AND PLANETS IN THEIR ARCHITECTURE AND DESIGN. I SAW ARCHAEOASTRONOMY IN GEORGIA, WHERE IT CONNECTED NATIVE AMERICANS TO THE ANCIENT MAYANS. AND I SAW IT IN A CAVE IN OKLAHOMA WHERE MARKINGS THAT ARE PART OF AN EQUINOX ILLUMINATION MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT BY THE CELTS. THE ANCIENT PRACTICE OF ARCHAEOASTRONOMY SEEMS TO TIE MANY HIGHLY ADVANCED CULTURES TOGETHER, AND IT ALSO SEEMS TO TIE THEM TO AMERICA. YOU KNOW, I'M LOOKING AT THAT STONE, AND IT LOOKS VERY INTERESTING. IS THERE ANY CHANCE WE COULD GO DOWN AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT CLOSER? - SURE. - OKAY. WELL, THAT'S PRETTY INTERESTING. CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT, SPECIFICALLY, WHAT HAPPENS WITH OUR ALIGNMENT HERE? - SURE, YEAH, WELL, BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IS, ON SUMMER SOLSTICE, THE SUN WILL RISE RIGHT ABOUT... RIGHT ABOUT IN THE MIDDLE HERE, AND JUST KIND OF GO AT... ALMOST LIKE A PERPENDICULAR TO WHERE THE STONE IS. AND JUST GO RIGHT ACROSS AND JUST KIND OF RISE UP DIAGONALLY... - UP IN THE SKY. - WELL, WE THINK, ACTUALLY, ORIGINALLY, IT PROBABLY WAS GONNA BE UP HERE. AND, YOU KNOW, OVER THE COURSE OF TIME, IT PROBABLY MOVED. - WELL, IF IT MOVED, THAT'S VERY INTERESTING, BECAUSE, OVER TIME, THE EARTH'S AXIS DOES SHIFT, - RIGHT. - YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER THE EARTHQUAKE IN JAPAN RECENTLY. IT WAS DOCUMENTED THAT THE AXIS OF THE EARTH ACTUALLY MOVED ABOUT 8 CENTIMETERS. NOW, THAT MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT, BUT OVER TIME, OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS, IT ADDS UP. SO, ACTUALLY, TO HAVE THE ALIGNMENT MOVE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT, BECAUSE WE CAN ACTUALLY USE THAT FOR DATING, AND SO AS, YOU KNOW, THE EARTH'S AXIS SHIFTS, THESE ALIGNMENTS DO SHIFT, AND THAT COULD INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT LENGTH OF TIME. - WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEONE COME UP AND CHECK THAT OUT. - REALLY? - AND THEY, UH... FROM HOW FAR IT'S MOVED. THEY ACTUALLY DATED THE SITE BACK TO ABOUT 3,800 YEARS AGO. 800 YEARS. OKAY, WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT. THAT'S REALLY AN IMPORTANT THING, BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT, BY USING ARCHAEOASTRONOMY, THAT'S ACTUALLY A MORE ACCURATE WAY OF DATING THEN CARBON 14. SO IF THAT'S THE CASE, YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY ANCIENT SITE HERE. CLEARLY, THIS ISN'T NATURAL... A NATURAL POSITION. THIS WAS PLACED IN THE GROUND. IT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN QUARRIED. IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN WORKED TTLE BIT. AND ALL THE SURFACES ARE DEFINITELY WEATHERED, SIGNIFICANTLY WEATHERED AND DEFINITELY INDICATES TIME. THIS HAS BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME. - WELL, YOU KNOW, ALSO WE CALL THIS PLACE AMERICA'S STONEHENGE, OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE OF THE STANDING STONES, BUT THERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT I'VE FOUND THAT I THINK REALLY DIRECTLY TIES THE SITE INTO STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND. - REALLY? - YEAH. - WELL, IF YOU'VE GOT TIME, I'D LOVE TO SEE IT. - SURE, LET'S GO. - ALL RIGHT. KELSEY, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT HERE. - ALL RIGHT, WELL, A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS ONOOGLE EARTH. AND I WAS KIND OF DRAWING ALL THE LINES OUT ON THE ALIGNMENTS, JUST BASICALLY TO SEE WHERE THEY GO. AS I WAS DRAWING ONE OUT ON THE SUMMER SOLSTICE SUNRISE ALIGNMENT... YEAH, I KEPT TAKING IT OUT FURTHER AND FURTHER, AND, YOU KNOW, I NOTICED IT WENT OVER NOVA SCOTIA AND NEW FOUNDLAND. - AND NORTH... KIND OF A NORTHEAST DIRECTION. OKAY. - RIGHT. YEAH. AND THEN AS I TOOK IT OVER, I NOTICED IT WENT RIGHT OVER ENGLAND, AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS KIND OF INTERESTING, SO I KEPT ZOOMING IN FURTHER AND FURTHER. AND I NOTICED IT WENT THROUGH STONEHENGE. - WAIT A MINUTE. WHAT? - IT'S GOING ALL THE WAY OVER THROUGH STONEHENGE. NOT ONLY DOES IT GO JUST THROUGH STONEHENGE, IT ACTUALLY GOES RIGHT THROUGH ONE OF THE TRILITHONS AT STONEHENGE. - WAIT A MINUTE, THROUGH ONE THE TRILITHONS AT STONEHENGE... - RIGHT. - FROM AMERICA'S STONEHENGE? STONEHENGE IS THE MOST WELL-KNOWN MEGALITHIC SITE OF ALL TIME. IT'S A SACRED SITE, BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHO BUILT IT OR EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS USED FOR. BUT MAYBE WHOEVER BUILT IT BUILT THIS TOO. IT'S AMAZING, BUT I SEE THIS LINE CONTINUES OFF TO THE EAST. WHERE DOES THAT GO? - YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BELIEVE WHERE THAT GOES. - LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT... WE'RE STARTING AT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THIS SUMMER SOLSTICE LINE EXTENDS TO STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND. - IT ACTUALLY GOES RIGHT THROUGH ONE OF THE TRILITHONS. - THAT'S AMAZING. BUT I SEE THIS LINE CONTINUES OFF TO THE EAST. WHERE DOES THAT GO? - YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BELIEVE WHERE THAT GOES. - OKAY, I'M READY. ALL RIGHT. - SO THEN IT STARTS GOING OVER TOWARDS THE MEDITERRANEAN. - YEAH. YOU'RE KIDDING ME. - YUP, IT GOES RIGHT THROUGH BEIRUT. - ARE YOU SURE THAT'S RIGHT? - I DOUBLE-CHECKED IT. - BEIRUT, LEBANON? WELL, THAT'S THE ANCIENT HOME OF THE PHOENICIANS. OKAY, YOU REALIZE WHAT THIS MEANS? DO YOU THINK THERE IS A CONNECTION HERE BETWEEN THE PHOENICIANS AND AMERICA'S STONEHENGE? - I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE. - WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT. IF YOU'VE GOT A CONNECTION HERE, THIS REWRITES A HUGE CHAPTER OF AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS ISN'T KIDDING AROUND. THE PHOENICIANS WERE BASED ALONG THE COASTLINE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN IN MODERN DAY LEBANON. THEY WERE AN ANCIENT SEAFARING CULTURE THAT EMERGED AROUND 1,200 B.C. THEY WERE KNOWN FOR TRADING WITH DISTANT LANDS. MAYBE THEY EVEN MADE IT TO AMERICA. THEY'RE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR INVENTING THE ALPHABET WE USE TODAY. SO, KELSEY, HOW DID YOUR FAMILY FIND OUT ABOUT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE? - WELL, MY GRANDFATHER ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT IT ON THE RADIO WHEN HE WAS GETTING HIS HAIR CUT BACK IN 1955. YEAH, AFTERWARDS, HE WENT UP AND CHECKED THE SITE OUT. HE WAS SO INTRIGUED BY IT, HE JUST HAD TO BUY IT. IT WASN'T ALWAYS CALLED AMERICA'S STONEHENGE. AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY A BOOK WRITTEN BACK AROUND 1907. IT REFERRED TO IT AS PATTEE'CAVES. - WHO'S PATTEE - HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE THAT WAS ON THE SITE AND LIVED THERE FOR THE 1700s AND INTO THE 1800s. - OH, REALLY? - YEAH. - WELL, I KNOW YOU GUYS THINK THIS IS AN OLD SITE, BUT WHY COULDN'T HE HAVE BUILT IT? - WELL, I CAN SHOW YOU. THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHERE PATTEE'S HOUSE WAS. - RIGHT IN THIS AREA RIGHT HERE? - YEAH. - THERE'S NO WAY THAT PATTEE BUILT THIS. IT JUST REEKS OF BEING REALLY OLD. AND IF IT'S OLD, IT'S IMPORTANT. - SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT HE USED THE EXISTING STONE STRUCTURES UP IN THAT AREA FOR ANIMAL PENS. - HE BUILT THOSE HUGE, MASSIVE WALLS FOR ANIMALS WHEN HE'S GOT ALL THESE TREES AND HE COULD HAVE USED WOOD? - THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK. YEAH. WELL, I DON'T BUY THAT ONE. I MEAN, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THESE ROCKS. - I WOULDN'T WANT TO MOVE THEM. - WHAT'S THAT BIG SLAB THERE? WAS THAT LIKE A ROOF? - WE THINK THAT WAS MOST LIKELY A ROOF SLAB FOR A CHAMBER RIGHT THERE, AND IT COLLAPSED. - YOU KNOW WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ROCKS LIKE THAT? THOSE ACTUALLY SERVE AS CLOCKS AS WELL AND INDICATE SOMETHING ABOUT THE AGE OF A STRUCTURE. THIS HAS A GENUINE FEEL TO IT. AND IT'S... IT'S AMAZING. I MEAN, LOOK AT ALL THIS. - WE DO HAVE ONE MORE THING THAT TIES THIS SITE INTO THE PHOENICIANS. - IT TURNS OUT KELSEY'S DAD HAS A STONE FROM THE SITE. IT HAS A CARVING ON IT, MAYBE SOME KIND OF ANCIENT MESSAGE. - SCOTT, THIS IS THE BAAL STONE. IT WAS FOUND IN 1964. - WHAT DOES IT SAY? - WELL, IT SAYS, "TO BAAL, ON BEHALF OF THE CANAANITES, THIS IS DEDICATED." - THE CANAANITES? FROM THE LAND OF CANAAN. - THAT'S RIGHT. - THAT'S WHAT THEY USED TO CALL THEMSELVES, BUT EVERYBODY IN THE REGION CALLED THEM THE PHOENICIANS. THEY GOT ALL OVER THE KNOWN WORLD AT THAT TIME, AND MANY PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THEY MADE IT OVER HERE TO NORTH AMERICA. - AND THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF POSSIBLE PHOENICIAN WRITINGS ALL THE WAY FROM MAINE DOWN TO BRAZIL. - WELL, I TELL YOU WHAT. IF THIS IS INDEED A PHOENICIAN INSCRIPTION, YOU'VE REALLY GOT SOMETHING IMPORTANT HERE. - ABSOLUTELY. - I MEAN, TOGETHER WITH THE ALIGNMENT THAT YOU FOUND, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INCREDIBLE SITE, AN INCREDIBLE DISCOVERY. AND IT REALLY JUST BLASTS APART THE HISTORY BOOKS AND PLACES EUROPEANS HERE IN NORTH AMERICA AROUND 3,500 YEARS AGO. BEFORE I MAKE ANY CONCLUSIONS, I NEED TO MAKE SURE THIS INSCRIPTION IS OLD AND THAT THE LINES ARE MAN-MADE, NOT NATURAL. BY USING A 3-D MICROSCOPE, I CAN SEE HOW DEEP THE GROOVES GO AND IF THE INSCRIPTION HAS BEEN WEATHERING FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT I WANT TO DO IS, I WANT TO FOCUS ON THIS GROOVE RIGHT HERE, WHICH I NUMBERED AS NUMBER THREE. GROOVE NUMBER THREE, AND THAT CORRESPONDS TO THIS GROOVE RIGHT HERE. THIS IS ABOUT 4,000 MICRONS FROM THE HIGHEST POINT DOWN TO THE DEEPEST POINT. THIS ONE CLEARLY IS A MAN-MADE GROOVE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE IT HERE. I CAN ALREADY TELL MANY OF THESE MARKS THAT MAKE UP THE INSCRIPTION COULD BE CENTURIES OLD, AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THEY WERE DELIBERATELY MADE. BECAUSE IT REFERENCES THE CANAANITES, I HAVE TO CONSIDER THE PHOENICIANS, BUT I NEED TO KNOW MORE. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE HERE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THAT POSSIBLY COULD TIE THIS SITE TO THE PHOENICIANS? - WELL, THERE IS ONE MORE THING. IT'S ACTUALLY UP ON THE SITE. WE CALL IT THE SACRIFICIAL TABLE. - SACRIFICIAL TABLE? - YES. - WELL, I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE TILL I SEE THAT. - AND THIS IS THE SACRIFICIAL TABLE. - THIS? DO YOU THINK THERE WAS REALLY HUMAN SACRIFICES HERE? - WE BELIEVE THE SACRIFICIAL TABLE COULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR HUMAN OR ANIMAL SACRIFICE. THE STONE'S ABOUT 9 FEET BY 6 FEET. IT SITS ON FOUR LEGS. IT WEIGHS ABOUT 4 1/2 TONS. AND ON TOP IS A RECTANGULAR-SHAPED GROOVE THAT'S ABOUT 6 FEET BY 4 FEET. AND THE TABLE'S TILTED TOWARDS ME. SO IF THERE WAS A FLUID, SUCH AS BLOOD, ON IT, IT WOULD GO INTO THE GROOVE, AND THEN IT WOULD CONTINUE IN THE GROOVE TOWARDS THIS LITTLE RUNNEL RIGHT HERE. AND IT WOULD GO INTO POSSIBLY A LITTLE VASE. THERE IS A CUTOUT IN THE BEDROCK WHERE A VASE COULD SIT. - WELL, I SEE THE GROOVE. AND YOU THINK THIS WAS FOR CHANNELING BLOOD? THAT'S AMAZING. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT I SEE. AND YOU SEE ALL THIS CRACKING AND THIS LAYERING HERE ALONG THE ENTIRE SURFACE? THAT'S WHAT WE CALL EXFOLIATION WEATHERING. IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN DEAD SKIN PEELS OFF YOUR BODY. THAT'S INTERESTING FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS. FIRST OFF, THAT INDICATES A LOT OF WEATHERING HAS GONE ON HERE. THIS IS WETTING AND DRYING, FREEZING AND THAWING. AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LOSS OF MATERIAL ON THE SURFACE, WHICH INDICATES SIGNIFICANT AGE. AND I THINK THIS COULD PROBABLY BE USED AS A WEATHERING CLOCK. I SEE SIGNIFICANT WEATHERING HERE THAT APPEARS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ASTRONOMICAL ALIGNMENTS THAT WE SAW, WITH THE STRUCTURES THAT ARE HERE, ICH INDICATE THAT THIS IS A VERY OLD PLACE. - THERE'S ONE MORE SECRET TO THE TABLE I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU. - OH. HELLO, SCOTT WOLTER. - WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT? HELLO, SCOTT WOLTER. SO YOU'RE THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN? - THAT'S RIGHT - THAT'S FUNNY SFF. SO WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE? - WELL, SCOTT, YOU'RE STANDING IN THE ORACLE CHAMBER. AND WE CALL IT THE ORACLE CHAMBER BECAUSE OF THIS TUBE HERE THAT GOES THROUGH THE WALL ABOUT 6 FEET, FROM THE ORACLE CHAMBER WHERE WE'RE STANDING OUT TO THE SACRIFICIAL TABLE. AND WE THINK DURING A CEREMONY, PERHAPS PEOPLE WATCHING ABOVE WOULD HEAR THIS VOICE COMING OUT. AND IT WOULD BE LIKE A GOD OR A SPIRIT TALKING TO THEM. AND IT WAS PROBABLY A PRIEST OR SHAMAN ACTUALLY SHOUTING THROUGH THE TUBE. - INTERESTING. SO REALLY WHAT WE HAVE IS AN EXAMPLE OF ARCHAEOACOUSTICS, THE SCIENCE OF WHERE THE ANCIENTS WOULD MANIPULATE SOUND, TYPICALLY IN RITUALS, BY USING SOMETHING LIKE THIS TUBE HERE TO CREATE A PRETTY SCARY SOUND. AND IN THIS CASE, CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMEBODY SITTING ON THAT TABLE ABOUT TO BE SACRIFICED AND HEAR THAT VOICE? I MEAN, IT MUST HAVE BEEN REALLY SCARY. I CAN'T HELP MYSELF. DO YOU MIND IF I GIVE IT A TRY? - BE OUR GUEST, SCOTT. - OKAY. ALL RIGHT. THIS IS BAAL. GET OFF MY LAWN. I'M GLAD I CAME TO INVESTIGATE THIS SITE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S MORE INTERESTING: THE SACRIFICIAL TABLE, THE BAAL STONE, OR THE SUMMER SOLSTICE LINE THAT CONNECTS AMERICA'S STONEHENGE TO THE ONE IN ENGLAND AND, FURTHER EAST, TO BEIRUT, LEBANON, HOME OF THE ANCIENT PHOENICIANS. I PLAN ON COMING BACK FOR THE SOLSTICE, BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M HEADED TO MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE TO TALK TO AN EXPERT ON PHOENICIAN CULTURE. - HEY, SCOTT. MARK MCMENAMIN. - HEY, SCOTT WOLTER. MARK, I JUST CAME BACK FROM A VERY INTERESTING PLACE CALLED AMERICA'S STONEHENGE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I SAW THAT WAS DISCOVERED BY KELSEY STONE, THE SON OF THE OWNERS, WAS A LONG-RANGE ALIGNMENT THAT STARTS AT THEIR SITE THAT GOES FROM THEIR SITE TO STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND AND THEN EXTENDS TO BEIRUT, LEBANON, WHICH IS THE ANCESTRAL HOME OF THE PHOENICIANS. WHO WERE THE PHOENICIANS? - THE PHOENICIANS WERE A GROUP OF MIDDLE EASTERN PEOPLE. AND THEIR CENTER WAS IN MODERN LEBANON. AND THEY DEVELOPED COLONIES WESTWARD FROM THERE, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH WAS CARTHAGE. THE CARTHAGINIANS WERE PHOENICIANS ON STEROIDS, BECAUSE THEY WERE THE MOST POWERFUL PHOENICIAN CULTURE THAT EVER DEVELOPED. ALSO, THEY TENDED TO BE VERY SECRETIVE, SO IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE PHOENICIANS KNEW, WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO. AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM. AND IT'S A DIFFICULT TASK, BECAUSE THERE'S NOT MUCH EVIDENCE. THE PHOENICIANS REALLY SORT OF APPEAR AROUND 1,200 B.C. THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD TRADING CENTERS AND COLONIZATION CENTERS. AND THEY BEGAN TO MOVE BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST. PART OF THE REASON FOR PHOENICIAN SUCCESS AS NAVIGATORS WAS THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO NAVIGATE AT NIGHT. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THEY KNEW ABOUT POLARIS, THE POLE STAR. - POLARIS IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE NORTH STAR. AND IF THE PHOENICIANS KNEW ABOUT IT, CHANCES ARE THEY KNEW ABOUT THE REST OF THE SKY TOO: THE SUN, THE STARS, THE MOON, THE PLANETS. AND THAT MEANS THEY WOULD HAVE HAD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF ARCHAEOASTRONOMY TO CREATE THE SUMMER SOLSTICE ALIGNMENT FROM AMERICA'S STONEHENGE TO STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND. - THIS PROPOSED ALIGNMENT AT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE IS VERY INTRIGUING. AND THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT IT WILL CONNECT TO SOME RESEARCH THAT I DID, IN PARTICULAR, A STUDY THAT I MADE OF A GROUP OF PHOENICIAN COINS THAT HAD BEEN MINTED IN CARTHAGE IN 350 B.C. AND THAT I INTERPRETED AS HAVING A MAP ON THE REVERSE OF THE COIN. - YOU HAVE A PICTURE OF THE COIN? - YES. - THIS IS... THIS IS GOOD. - HERE'S A PICTURE OF THE COIN RIGHT HERE. OKAY, HERE ARE TWO IMAGES FROM THE BRITISH MUSEUM. YOU CAN PICK OUT THE ISLANDS PRETTY CLEARLY. SARDINIA IN THE CENTER, WHICH IS THE CENTRAL POINT IN THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN. AND WE'VE GOT SICILY THERE, THE TRIANGULAR ISLAND, THE BOOT OF ITALY COMING DOWN. IBERIAN PENINSULA HERE. THIS STRAIGHT LINE HERE IS PROBABLY THE NORTH COAST OF AFRIC INDIA HERE, AND THIS IS AMERICA. AND THIS ALMOST LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY ARE GIVING US THE GULF OF MEXICO THERE IN FLORIDA. BUT THAT COULD BE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION. - WELL, THAT'S FASCINATING. COUPLE OF THOUGHTS HERE. - SURE. - IF THEY'RE HERE, THEY WERE PUT THERE FOR A REASON. AND, I GUESS, UNTIL A BETTER THESIS COMES ALONG, I LIKE YOURS... I LOVE YOURS, BUT... - WELL, THANK YOU. I THINK THAT THIS GIVES US AN INSIGHT INTO THE PHOENICIAN PSYCHE. - ABSOLUTELY. - AND, REMEMBER, THEY'RE EXTREMELY SECRETIVE, YOU KNOW, AND SO THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE GIVING AWAY THE STORY, SO TO SPEAK. HOWEVER, THERE WAS... TO WANT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF RECORD TO WHAT THEY HAD DONE. SO HERE ON THESE COINS, IN THESE TINY LITTLE IMAGES, THEY WERE GIVING US AN EXTREMELY CONDENSED PHOENICIAN GEOGRAPHY, YOU KNOW, TELLING A HUGE STORY IN A COUPLE OF MILLIMETER SPACE HERE. - THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT. IT'S THIS SACRIFICIAL TABLE. DID THE PHOENICIANS PRACTICE HUMAN SACRIFICE? - YES, THEY DID. AND I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT THEY DID PRACTICE HUMAN SACRIFICE. AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF SOURCES, BIBLICAL AND OTHERWISE, SUGGESTING THAT THIS WAS THE CASE. - DO YOU THINK THE PHOENICIANS MADE IT TO NORTH AMERICA, OR NOT? - THEY PROBABLY WENT FARTHER THAN ANYONE IS WILLING TO ADMIT TODAY. THEY HAD THE SHIPS TO DO SO. I THINK THE PHOENICIANS COULD EASILY HAVE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC. THEIR WHOLE HISTORY SUGGESTS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TRIED TO DO THIS. DIODORUS, A GREEK HISTORIAN, REPORTS THAT PHOENICIANS KNEW ABOUT THIS GIGANTIC ISLAND OUT IN THE ATLANTIC WITH NAVIGABLE RIVERS. THE ONLY PLACE WITH NAVIGABLE RIVERS ONCE YOU GET PAST SPAIN IS AMERICA. - WHEN I WENT TO AMERICA'S STONEHENGE, I WAS AMAZED TO LEARN ABOUT A POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT SITE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND. BOB STONE PURCHASED AMERICA'S STONEHENGE IN 1955, BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THIS ANCIENT PLACE NEEDED TO BE PRESERVED. YEARS LATER, WHEN HIS GRANDSON KELSEY MAPPED THE SITE'S SUNRISE SOLSTICE LINE, HE DISCOVERED THAT LINE STARTED AT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE AND WENT STRAIGHT TO STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND. AND NOW I'M HEADING THERE TO SEE IF THESE TWO ANCIENT SITES WITH MASSIVE STANDING STONES ARE CONNECTED. SO, HENRY, I'M HERE BECAUSE I'M INVESTIGATING A MEGALITHIC SITE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE CALLED AMERICA'S STONEHENGE. AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A CONNECTION TO STONEHENGE HERE. AND I'D JUST LIKE TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STONEHENGE. - WELL, STONEHENGE, I MEAN, IS... IT IS ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS PREHISTORIC MONUMENTS, BUT, I THINK, A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE ABOUT IT IS THAT IT TOOK OVER 1,000 YEARS TO MAKE WHAT YOU CAN SEE NOW. - TO CONSTRUCT? - YEAH, YEAH. THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT PHASES. AND IT GETS REINVENTED THROUGH TIME. - WELL, YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE THINK ABOUT STONEHENGE, THEY THINK ABOUT WHAT'S RIGHT HERE, BUT YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT GOES ALL AROUND US, EVEN BEYOND WHERE WE ARE? - YES, YEAH, I MEAN, GOING BACK FOR A COUPLE OF THOUSAND YEARS BEFORE, YEAH, YOU'VE GOT VARIOUS MONUMENTS IN ALL SORT OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. THE FOCUS OVER TIME BECOMES STONEHENGE. - THESE STONES. - YEAH. - STONEHENGE IS THE MOST WELL-KNOWN MEGALITHIC SITE IN THE WORLD. IT CONSISTS OF 150 ENORMOUS STONES, THE TALLEST OF WHICH RISES 22 FEET FROM THE GROUND. BUT IN THE BEGINNING, AROUND 3,100 B.C., IT WAS JUST A "HENGE," A DITCH, A BANK, AND SEVERAL ROUND PITS, BUT EVEN THEN, IT WAS A POPULAR GATHERING PLACE. BEING A GEOLOGIST, I'M VERY INTERESTED IN THE ROCKS, THE STONES. TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE STONES. THERE'S A VARIATION IN THE GEOLOGY, IS THAT RIGHT? - YEAH, THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT TYPES: THE VERY BIG STONES ARE SARSEN, AND THEY COME FROM SORT OF THE LOCAL AREA, YOU KNOW, WITHIN 20 MILES OR SO. THE BLUESTONES, WHICH ARE THE SMALLER ONES... THEY'RE STILL VERY BIG. - YEAH. - THEY COME FROM SOUTH WALES, SO, YOU KNOW... - SO HOW FAR AWAY IS THAT? - WELL, IT'S ABOUT 150 MILES, BUT IF YOU THINK, ACTUALLY, HOW THEY WOULD HAVE TRANSPORTED THEM. - YEAH. - AND THAT'S NOT STRAIGHT. - THAT'S A HECK OF A TASK. 240 MILES MAYBE. I MEAN, THAT'S AT THE HEART OF IT. - THAT REALLY SUGGESTS SOPHISTICATION AND COORDINATION AND SOMETHING AT A PRETTY COMPLICATED LEVEL. - I THINK THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF SOPHISTICATION. PEOPLE DO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. I MEAN, THE FACT THAT THEY CAN BUILD STONEHENGE, THE AMOUNT OF LABOR WHICH GOES INTO BUILDING SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS INCREDIBLE. I MEAN, PEOPLE HAVE ESTIMATED SOMETHING LIKE 30 MILLION HOURS. - 30 MILLION HOURS? - OF WORK, YEAH. - AND HOW MANY PEOPLE, SAY, TO MOVE ONE OF THOSE STONES? - THERE'S NO REAL WAY OF TELLING. IT'S SOMETHING WHICH WE CONTINUE TO SORT OF THINK ABOUT. BUT THE FACT THAT THEY DID IT, I MEAN, IT'S A MASSIVE FEAT OF ENGINEERING. WE KEEP ON FINDING THEY'RE MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN WE THOUGHT. SO IT MIGHT SAY 600 PEOPLE, BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN JUST COUPLE. - THE BLUESTONES MAY NOT BE THE BIGGEST STONES HERE, BUT FOR ME, THEY'RE THE MOST INTERESTING. THEY'RE SAID TO HAVE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND I THINK AMERICA'S STONEHENGE HAS THAT TOO. THE BLUESTONES CAME FROM A LAND THAT WAS BELIEVED TO HAVE HEALING POWERS. ARCHAEOLOGISTS THINK STONEHENGE MAY HAVE BEEN A FRANCHISE OF SORTS, A CLOSER VERSION OF A FARAWAY, SACRED PLACE. THERE'S NO DOUBT THESE STONES WERE PLACED HERE FOR A REASON. AND IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE SUN AND THE SOLSTICE, JUST LIKE IT DOES AT STONEHENGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. IF WE THINK BACK TO ANCIENT TIMES, WERE THERE RITUALS GOING ON? WHAT WERE THE PEOPLE DOING AT THIS SITE? - WE CAN SEE SOMEBODY'S FOLLOWING, ON THE SUMMER SOLS... YOU KNOW, THE DAY OF THE SOLSTICE, PEOPLE STARTING THEIR DAY AT THE EASTERN PITS, AS FROM HERE, YOU CAN OBSERVE SUN RISING ON THE SOLSTICE. AND THEN THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE SUN ROUND. SO, BASICALLY, THE ACTUAL... THIS LONG RECTANGULAR ENCLOSURE IS BASICALLY JUST A WALKWAY. SO YOU FOLLOW ROUND THE PERIMETER, FOLLOWING THE SUN IN FRONT OF YOU ALL THE TIME, BUT IT'S A BIT LIKE A CHURCH OR A CATHEDRAL NOW. YOU HAVE MULPLE FUNCTIONS. AND I THINK ALL OF THOSE WOULD BE HAPPENING HERE. - WHY DO YOU THINK IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR THESE ANCIENT PEOPLE TO TRACK THE MOVEMENTS OF THE CELESTIAL BODIES? - THE PEOPLE ARE FARMERS. THEY RELY ON SEASONS. THEY RELY ON UNDERSTANDING. THEY KNOW WHEN TO PLANT CROPS AND WHEN TO HARVEST THEM, BUT ACTUALLY HAVING A SENSE OF HOW THAT TIME DEVELOPS, I THINK, IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YEAH, THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE BODIES, I THINK, IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO BEING HUMAN AND BEING FARMERS, BUT ALSO SOMETHING WHICH THEY CELEBRATE. ABOUT THE ARCHAEOASTRONOMY HERE. ME A LI - WELL, THERE'S BEEN, AGAIN, A HUGE AMOUNTF WORK. YOU'LL SEE THERE ARE SORT OF STONES DOTTED AROUND THE SITE. - I SAW A BIG ONE... WELL, I CAN SEE IT RIGHT HERE... THAT BIG STANDING STONE OVER THERE OFF TO THE SIDE. - THAT ONE'S KNOWN AS THE HEEL STONE. NOW, THE WEIRD THING ABOUT THAT STONE IS, IT'S UNDRESSED. IT HASN'T BEEN WORKED LIKE ALL THE OTHER STONES ON SITE. BUT WHAT SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT IS THAT STONE, WHENEVER YOU LOOK AT THE CENTER OF STONEHENGE AND LINE THINGS UP, AND PEOPLE HAVE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THAT'S THE STONE WHICH LEADS YOU TOWARDS THE SUMMER SOLSTICE SUNRISE. IF YOU LINE UP THE HEEL STONE WITH EACH OF THOSE PITS, ON ONE SIDE, IT MARKS SUNRISE ON THE SUMMER SOLSTICE, SUNSET ON THE SUMMER SOLSTICE. THE OTHER I DON'T KNOW; IS THAT MORE THAN COINCIDENCE, THAT THEY ACTUALLY ARE LINING UP WITH TWO VERY SORT OF SIGNIFICANT SET OF EVENTS? - I DON'T THINK IT'S A COINCIDENCE. NO, I DON'T. I HAVE SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU. IT'S A NEW DISCOVERY OF ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE. IT'S A SUMMER SOLSTICE LINE RUNNING FROM THE SITE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE DIRECTLY TO RIGHT HERE. THAT'S BEYOND POSSIBLE. - WHEN I WAS AT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE, A MEGALITHIC SITE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, I LEARNED ABOUT A NEW DISCOVERY BY THE OWNER'S SON, A CONNECTION BETWEEN THAT SITE AND STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND. FROM THERE, THE LINE EXTENDS EVEN FURTHER, TO MODERN DAY LEBANON, WHICH WAS THE HOME BASE OF THE PHOENICIANS. I WANT TO FIND OUT IF A STONEHENGE EXPERT THINKS ALL THREE SITES COULD BE CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER AND TO THAT SPECIFIC ANCIENT CULTURE. SO HERE WE HAVE THE ALIGNMENT THAT STARTS AT AMERICA'S STONEHENGE AT THE CENTER OF THE OBSERVATORY. AND THEN AS YOU EXTEND A LINE THROUGH AND CONTINUE THAT LINE, IT COMES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC AND COMES RIGHT HERE TO STONEHENGE. WHEN YOU LOOK HERE AT A CLOSE-UP, YOU CAN SEE THAT IT GOES RIGHT THROUGH THAT CENTRAL TRILITHON. THEN, IF YOU EXTEND THAT LINE, IT GOES TO BEIRUT, LEBANON, THE HOME OF THE PHOENICIANS. AS INCREDIBLE AS IT IS, IT APPEARS TO BE THERE. WHAT'S YOUR REACTION? - I THINK IT'S INCREDIBLE. I CAN'T IMAGINE THERE'S A LINK, OTHER THAN THE POSSIBILITY THAT PEOPLE ARE MARKING THE SAME SORT OF ALIGNMENTS. AND, I THINK, ALSO, WHEN YOU EXTEND IT ONTO THE PHOENICIAN WORLD, THEIR WORLD STARTS AROUND ABOUT 1,200 B.C., AND THIS SITE'S SORT OF FINISHED, REALLY, BY ABOUT 2,000 B.C., SO THERE'S A GOOD 800 YEARS OR SO DIFFERENCE. INTERESTINGLY, I THINK STONEHENGE HAS ATTRACTED PEOPLE IN PREHISTORY FROM QUITE FAR, FAR AWAY. THERE'S A BURIAL JUST OVER THERE. THERE'S A COUPLE OF BURIALS FROM OVER THERE, ONE FROM ABOUT 1,400 B.C. SO IF PEOPLE ARE MOVING HERE, IT'S FEASIBLE THAT THE PHOENICIANS MIGHT HAVE BEEN. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT BEYOND POSSIBILITY, BUT THEY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF STONEHENGE, BECAUSE IT'S TOO EARLY. - I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THAT THIS SITE WAS AN OBSERVATORY, AND IT WAS SACRED. WHEN WE HAD THESE ANCIENT PEOPLE GOING TO OTHER PLACES, LIKE NORTH AMERICA AND OTHER CONTINENTS, SOMETHING THAT WAS SACRED, THAT WAS VITAL TO THEIR EXISTENCE AND THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM, THEY WOULD BUILD THOSE IN OTHER PLACES. AND COULD PERHAPS THESE SACRED SITES BE CONNECTED OR CONNECT THESE PEOPLE ACROSS THE CONTINENTS? - I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I THINK THESE SITES ARE SACRED IN THAT WAY, AND I THINK POSSIBLY PEOPLE MOVE, BUT ALSO, EQUALLY MAYBE, JUST PEOPLE ARE SO SIMILAR IN WHEREVER THEY LIVE ON THE PLANET, THAT THEY ALL OBSERVE THE SAME SORTS OF THINGS. WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE ACTUALLY MOVE OR DON'T MOVE BETWEEN THESE PLACES, THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE SIMILAR SORTS OF SITES ALL OVER THE PLANET, ALL RESPECTING THE HEAVENLY BODIES AND SO ON, I THINK IT'S JUST A REALLY NICE THING. YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING ABOUT HUMANITY AND BEING HUMAN. - WELL, I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE CAN DEFINITELY AGREE ON, IF NOTHING ELSE, PLACES LIKE STONEHENGE AND AMERICA'S STONEHENGE PROVE HOW IMPORTANT TRACKING THE CELESTIAL BODIES WERE TO THESE ANCIENT PEOPLE. THE PHOENICIANS COULDN'T HAVE BUILT STONEHENGE, BUT THE SITE STILL MIGHT HAVE BEEN A SACRED SANCTUARY FOR THEM. I THINK THE FACT THAT THIS PLACE DIRECTLY ALIGNS WITH AMERICA'S STONEHENGE ON THE SUMMER SOLSTICE IS NO MISTAKE. ARCHAEOASTRONOMY LINKS MANY CULTURES TOGETHER, LIKE THE MAYANS IN GEORGIA AND THE CELTS IN OKLAHOMA, AND I THINK IT'S ALSO WHAT LINKS THE PHOENICIANS TO OUR VERY OWN STONEHENGE, PROOF OF WHICH I'M ABOUT TO SEE WITH MY OWN EYES. THEY COULD BE THE ONES WHO MARKED AN IMPORTANT DAY, THE SUMMER SOLSTICE, WITH A STANDING STONE AT THE SITE OVER WHICH THE SUNRISE TAKES PLACE. HEY, GUYS. - GOOD MORNING, SCOTT. - HI, DENNIS. HI, KELSEY, HOW YOU DOING? - GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? - GOOD. - HOW DID THE TRIP GO? - I HAD A GREAT TRIP. I'VE GOT SOME REALLY GOOD STUFF TO SHARE WITH YOU, BUT I'M EXCITED TO SEE THAT ALIGNMENT, SO... THE SUN'S COMING UP. SHOULD WE HEAD OUT? - I'M READY. - SOUNDS GOOD. - LET'S GO. WE'RE ABOUT TO SEE THE SUN RISE OVER THE SOLSTICE STONE, TO SEE THE ALIGNMENT KELSEY STONE DISCOVERED THAT LINKS THIS SITE TO STONEHENGE IN ENGLAND. IF YOU WERE TO DRAW A LINE DIRECTLY THROUGH THE SUN AS IT RISES OVER THIS STONE, IT WOULD RUN RIGHT THROUGH THE CENTER TRILITHON AT STONEHENGE AND THEN CONTINUE ON TO LEBANON, ONCE THE CENTER OF THE PHOENICIAN EMPIRE. TO ME, IT'S PROOF OF AN ADVANCED UNDERSTANDING OF ARCHAEOASTRONOMY AND OF AN ANCIENT CONNECTION TO THE UNITED STATES. WHAT ELSE CAN YOU SAY BUT, "WOW, THAT'S AMAZING?" - IT NEVER GETS OLD. - TELL YOU WHAT, WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS AN AMAZINGLY ACCURATE ASTRONOMICAL CALENDAR, IS NO ACCIDENT. I SAW THE EXACT SAME THING AT STONEHENGE. THEY USE STANDING STONES JUST LIKE THIS TO TRACK THE SEASONS. THEY USED IT FOR WORSHIP. I THINK THEY ALSO USED IT FOR NAVIGATION TO COME TO THE NEW WORLD, AMONGST OTHER PLACES. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. THE BEGINNING OF STONEHENGE PREDATES YOUR SITE HERE. THE LATER STAGES DO CORRESPOND, ESPECIALLY WITH THE STONE-ERECTING PERIOD, SO THERE MIGHT BE A CONNECTION THERE. THE PHOENICIAN CONNECTION IS A LITTLE BIT TENUOUS, BECAUSE THIS ACTUALLY PREDATES THE PHOENICIANS BY A LITTLE BIT, MAYBE IT WAS A PROTO-PHOENICIAN GROUP. WE'RE NOT SURE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT IS, YOU'VE GOT A SACRED SITE IN ENGLAND. YOU'VE GOT A SACRED SITE HERE. AND THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THEY'RE CONNECTED, WHETHER IT WAS THE PHOENICIANS OR NOT. WHAT IT TELLS US IS THAT SOME HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED CULTURE, PROBABLY THE ELITE IN THAT CULTURE, CAME OVER HERE AND ESTABLISHED THIS INCREDIBLE SITE. AND IT'S SITES LIKE THIS THAT CONNECT THE NEW WORLD TO THE OLD WORLD. THE STONE FAMILY WANTED TO KNOW IF THE PHOENICIANS MADE THEIR SITE. IT'S A QUESTION THE FAMILY HAS BEEN TRYING TO ANSWER SINCE BOB STONE BOUGHT THIS MYSTERIOUS SITE BACK IN 1955. I BELIEVE THEY COULD EASILY HAVE MADE IT TO THE AMERICAS. SOMEBODY HAD TO ASSEMBLE THOSE HUGE STONES. SOMEONE WITH A VAST KNOWLEDGE OF ARCHAEOASTRONOMY. I BELIEVE ARCHAEOASTRONOMY IS WHAT LINKS TOGETHER MANY ADVANCED CIVILIZATIONS AND IS WHAT LINKS SOME OF THEM TO AMERICA. I BELIEVE THERE WAS CONTACT BETWEEN ANCIENT CULTURES. IT MAY BE WHY AMERICA'S STONEHENGE WAS BUILT WHERE IT WAS, TO CREATE A PLACE IN THE NEW WORLD THAT LINED UP WITH A SACRED SITE IN THE OLDLD. PEOPLE WERE CONNECTED. AND WE'RE JUST STARTING TO FIND OUT HOW. Subtitles Diego Moraes www.oakisland.tk
