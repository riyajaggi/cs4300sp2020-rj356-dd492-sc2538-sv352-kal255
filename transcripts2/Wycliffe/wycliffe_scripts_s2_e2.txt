 Yes, fine. Drive carefully. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Love you. He's got some heat in his near foreleg. Nah. He was stepping out sweetly, not feeling it. He could win the Open with a decent jockey up. Like you, you mean. Yeah. I qualified him. Alison's no blooming idea. Couldn't kick a donkey off.

 [music playing] [crash] [music playing] Yeah, well if you're watching, if anyone saw her, or knows where she is-- please just call and tell us that she's all right. Whoever's holding my wife, please just call. Crocodile tears, ma'am? Convinced me at the time. WYCLIFFE: What do we know about him? Alex Keir. 45, runs a stableyard. PNC threw up a spent drunk driving charge a couple of years back. Apart from that he's clean. And the wife? Alison Keir. Been missing a couple of days before the local boys brought us in, sir. She's 35, otherwise unknown to us. Oh, and, uh-- her car disappeared, too. All right. Anything else? Yeah. Potter's chasing up the woman's medical background, see if there's any, you know, psycho problems. That's worth a look. But it doesn't strike me she's gone walk about. No, sir. I've got this nasty feeling we're going to find her tied up in a ditch somewhere. Ever the optimist, Dixon. Good morning. Morning. You booked a ride? No, no. It would be cruelty to animals if I sat on a horse. Detective Inspector Kersey. CID. Penryn. Dave Penryn. So. You found her, then? Mrs. Keir? I take it you work here, Mr. Penryn, do you? Yep. [inaudible] I'm officially the gardener, but I ride out, school the chasers, get them shipshape. Ah, racehorses, are they? Some are. Some aren't. Now this one'll never make it in. Walking tin of dog food, he is. Jumps like a crab. DOUG: So how long have you known the Keirs? Since they first come down here. Governor bought the place off my father. The old bugger ran it into the ground. DOUG: Are they good people to work for? There's worse jobs. Here. Don't get too close to his back end. He [inaudible] kicks. - Oh. Cheers. Hold the doors, will you? Who's, uh-- who's the young lady? Diana. Is that the Keirs' daughter, is it? You might think so, way she goes on. She's just a stablehand. Mucking out, that sort of thing. Mrs. Keir took her in, a couple of years back. How do you mean, took her in? She's one of them female horse nuts. Started hanging about the place, working voluntary. Spun some sob story about her parents being dead. So in the end, Alison gave her a job. Do you know, um-- are there any problems between them that you're aware of? Who? Mr. and Mrs. Keir. I wouldn't know. Don't move in my circles, do they? However, a married couple, middle-aged, no kids-- speaks for itself, don't it? Why do they call it point to point racing? It's a circuit that the horses jump around, from one point to another. All amateur riders, you know? I see. So you spent that night in a hotel? Yes. I gave your local chaps the details. How long have you had the stables? Been here about eight years. We were up north. Alison adores horses. She lives and breathes for them. I'm sorry. I appreciate this must be very difficult for you. Um. How did your wife seem when you left her? She was fine. I mean, she was looking forward to the Hunt Open. She was going to ride our horse, Greek Warrior, in the race. She ever gone missing before? No, never. No. She's not wandered off for a few days, or-- there's no friends, relatives, she might have spent time with? Absolutely not. She would have told me if she was planning a trip or anything like that. She wouldn't just go off without me telling. Oh. Sorry. Is it all right if I work down in the office now? Yes. It's been checked. I'll need a list of anyone, everyone you can think of, who your wife might try and contact. Yes. I'll-- I'll do that. Oh, god, superintendent, what's happened to her? I don't know, Mr. Keir. She was so happy. She was so happy here. We'll do everything we can to find her, Mr. Keir. I promise you. [music playing] Help! Help! DOUG: Hi. Anything down the stables? Well, there's a chap, Penryn. He's a stablehand. He lives over in the cottage in the back there. He says he heard nothing the night she went missing. He's definitely worth a closer look. Yep. What do you recommend? All signs it was a break in. Mrs. Keir could have stumbled across her intruder. He's panicked and abducted her in her own car. The burglar thought she recognized him, then. Yeah, it struck me that way, too. Shivering shaggers, don't tell me we're in agreement, Lucy, are we? Don't worry, Doug. It won't last. Him? Hotel alibi. Could have gone back in the night and done it, but-- no motive as yet. Hm. Seems pretty cut up though, doesn't he? Yeah. So it appears. Oh, god. What? We stable hacks for people and hire them out to other riders. So there was money taken from here the night Mrs. Keir went missing? Yep. About 80 pounds. They took the lot. Live at the house, do you, Diana? No. Dave lives up here. I rent a place over Delverton way. You're not from around these parts, are you? Pardon? Your accent. Touch of Yorkshire in there somewhere? I lived in the north for a bit, yeah. I thought so. I'm from Leeds myself. Well, just outside, actually. How well did you know Mrs. Keir? For the past two, three years, she's been like a mother to me. And Mr. Keir? I don't have much dealings with him. Why is that? I just don't. Where were you on Tuesday night? At home. Ah. That's Alison. Mrs. Keir with Greek Warrior. Beautiful horse. Oh, yeah. He's super. Jumps like a stag. Alison's dream was to win the Hunt Open race on him. You know horses? A little. I used to ride quite a lot. All right. Thank you, uh, Ms. Byrne. We may need to talk to you again. Sure. Any time. I'm always here. Just call if you want to book a ride. We've got some nice, gentle mares. Oh. OK. Thanks. [music playing] What kind of a feel did you get down there in the stables? Well, strained, but hardly surprising under the circumstances. Visit them again and try and dig a bit deeper if you can, Lucy. Maybe book that ride. Oh, yeah. That'd be good. It'll have to be on your own time, though. Budget's tight. Great. Thanks. My brother-in-law's in the Terriers. Army Barmy, is he? Nah. It's more of a drinking club, really. Boy Scouts and booze. Morning, sir. Yeah. Morning. Our glorious dead. You have a problem with that, Potter? Uh. No sir. I-- I was-- Excuse me. I'm looking for Superintendent Wycliffe. - It's Mr. Keir, isn't it? - Yeah. Is he here? I must see him. Yeah. This way, please. ALEX KEIR: Superintendent. Mr. Keir. Have you brought the list of names? No. This came this morning. It's demanding money for Alison. Yeah. Um-- just put it down on the desk, would you please? This maniac has kidnapped her. They-- they want money. You've got to find her. He's thre-- he's threatening to kill her. Just take it easy. It's typewritten. Good English, sir. It's demanding 50,000 pounds to be put in a numbered bank account within three days. It's an odd place to want ransom money lodged, isn't it? Just check the account with the bank, would you? Mr. Keir, has anyone else touched that letter? This? No, no. Only me. I brought it straight here. Oh-- the envelope, please. Yeah, I've got that here. Um. Look. I can't get that sort of money. No way can I get that money. Let's not panic. Here, sit down. Panic? My wife's life is being threatened. How would you feel? - Yes, yes. I understand. Look. Can the police put the money up? I doubt very much we could do that, sir. You said you would do everything to help. We are doing everything. It's just that, uh-- such things are not in our hands, Mr. Keir. But I'll look into it. I promise you. God. He said he's going to kill her. I mean, what-- what can I do? Oh, please. You've just got to help me. [music playing] What are you doing? Please don't do this. Let me go. I won't tell anyone it was you. Please. LUCY: Is he difficult to hold, the Warrior? DIANA: Yeah. Full of himself at the moment. When's his big race? The Hunt Open? It's next Saturday. So who will be riding Mrs. Keir's horse? Well, Alison, I hope. If she's back. Dave Penryn will want the leg up otherwise, if Mr. Keir decides to run the Warrior. Is there big money involved? Only small race prizes. And the betting? The bookies are there, yeah. Sometimes big money's laid on. Dave likes a good gamble. Does he? Mainly it's the kudos. Big rivalry. Open's the top race of everybody's season. Ah, I get it. So Dave Penryn wants to ride so he can grab the glory. Oh, yeah. He's always looking for it. Big opinion of himself, Dave has. Did Alison ever talk to you about her personal life? Sometimes. Do you think and her husband were happy with each other? On and off. Why is that? Did she tell you something? Diana? Alison got jealous sometimes. Oh, he played around a bit then, did he, Mr. Keir? Well, he's not what he seems. Put it that way. There's a woman-- Mrs. Tregelles-- Major Tregelles's wife. She's on the Hunt committee with Mr. Keir. And Mr. Keir and she have a relationship, you mean? Well, there's lots of gossip. You know how it is. Yeah. The Tregelleses have a horse, Paladin-- the only thing that would beat Warrior in the Open. So the Tregelleses and the Keirs are big rivals. Major Tregelles is. He's the win at all costs sort. [music playing] You must try to keep a grip on yourself. Yes. It will soon be over. One way or the other. [music playing] MRS. TREGELLES: Good morning. Morning, Mrs. Tregelles. How's Paladin? He's fit and ready to run his heart out. You won't run Greek Warrior in the Open? No. But maybe I should. Morning, Mrs. Tregelles. I must get on. Alex, I hope you get some good news soon. Yes, and thanks for everything, OK? This came. So we do nothing. Well, can you not at least raise the issue with the Chief Constable? I'd appreciate that. Yes, I would. Thank you. Right, Doug. Doug. Sorry, sir. Any joy with the money? The wheels of HQ grind slowly. Yes Potter? Forensic report on the ransom note and the envelope. Uh-- no fingerprints or indentations. Uh-- the envelope was posted in Truro. They're running checks on the typewriter format. It apparently was electronic. And a DNA check on the glue-- it was a lickable type of envelope seal. - All right. Well, keep me posted. - Ha. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. Any thoughts, Doug? Oh-- not worth wasting any breath on, sir. Suppose it was a burglary. Yeah. Yeah. Someone abducts her. Panics and then decides to go the whole hog and sends a ransom note. Yeah, it's possible. But the bank account that he wants the money put into was opened a year ago, with a false ID under the name of, uh-- Baker. And the address given doesn't trace. I'd say there's been some planning put into this. WYCLIFFE: Yeah, but-- it's very odd, though. Any joy down at the stables? I spoke to Diana Byrne, the stable secretary. She mentioned a Major and Mrs. Tregelles. She also gave me the impression that Alex Keir may well have been playing around with this Mrs. Tregelles. And that might just be local tittle-tattle, but-- We've got precious little else to go on [inaudible] There's also something about this big race coming up. Now, the Tregelleses and the Keirs both have horses running against each other. You're not suggesting, surely, that someone's abducted Alison Keir to stop her riding a horse? You can say, sir. I do know passions run deep in the horse world. Mm. Have you got an address for these Tregelles people? Yes. Well, you'd better get down there with Doug. Have a chat with them. Yes, sir. [phone ring] How was the horse ride? Oh. It was great. Now I know why the Queen rides side saddle. Ah, yes. Yes, put him on. Mr. Keir. Superintendent Wycliffe. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just keep the letter there. Yeah. And don't let anybody else touch it. [music playing] Now remember, Paladin rushes his fences, so find the stride. Go on. Gregory, our son. He'll ride Paladin in the Open. About Mr. Keir-- Oh, yes. Well, as I said, we've been close friends for, oh, five years or so. When did you last see him? Alex? This morning, up at the stables. And before that? Oh, I think it was last Monday I was up there. Why was that? Hunt business. Is that the only basis for your close friendship? Who have you been talking to? I'm sorry? Some people around these parts have little to do with their lives but gossip, Inspector. Some of them have in the past seen fit to repeat their innuendos in my husband's presence. Mrs. Tregelles, I can assure you I-- Alex Keir and I are friends. Good friends. Nothing more. Despite his wife's ridiculous accusations. And no doubt what you've heard from other people's wagging tongues. Too close in! Get hold of him! [inaudible] - Is that a guard's tie, sir? - Yes. I thought so. I was two Para myself, sir. Ah. The Danglers, eh. Falklands? Yes, sir. My swansong. MAJOR TREGELLES: A good few others too. Yes, sir. What about the Keir woman? Yes, um-- we've been given to believe that you and the Keirs had a bit of a healthy rivalry. Oh? Oh, with the horses, sir. Well, we both have animals running in the Hunt Open race, yeah. So best man wins sort of thing is it, sir? No. It's best horse. No, if ours wins the Open Race, he'll go to stud. That'll put a bit of value on the horse winning sir, wouldn't it? Oh, yes. Plenty. No, we'll sell Paladin on for breeding. It's a very expensive bloodline. Actually, it was Mr. Keir I wanted to talk to you about, sir. I don't know the man. Oh, I thought you and your wife were-- My wife is better acquainted with Mr. Keir. There's a mutual passion-- they-- they ride with each other. And that's all I know or want to know about Alex Keir, so. I'm sorry. I can't help you. Over here! Useless. When did the second letter arrive? This morning's post. I phoned your office straightaway. I'd like to go through with you exactly what the letter says. Well it's obvious, isn't it? This is a nightmare I'm going through-- can't you people understand that? Yes, I can, sir. If it was my wife, I'd feel just as you do, but-- He's going to kill her if we don't get the money. Yes. I've spoken to my superiors about that. And? We are unable to provide the ransom money. I'm sorry. Why? You know I can't raise it. This place is mortgaged to the hilt. Do you hold any insurance cover on Mrs. Keir? No. Why do you ask? Well, in the circumstances, you might have been able to negotiate for the insurers to put the money up. Oh. Because she's going to die anyway? Is that what you mean? Mr. Keir-- can we talk about the letter, please? Now. Here, at the end of the letter, it says-- don't ride the horse. What does that mean to you? Why would anyone demand that? I don't know. Is this is about a race? Who wouldn't want you to run the horse? Mr. Keir, think, please. This may be the key to what's happening here. I have no idea. I mean, it's plain as day, isn't it? We're dealing with some sort of maniac? Perhaps. And you're still standing here asking questions when you can at least be out searching for Alison. Mr. Keir, Cornwall is a very big place. It's not possible. At the moment, we have no indication at all where your wife might be being held. So we just sit and wait, until she turns up dead? Is that it? Ugh. It's a nasty business. Are we looking at accidental death? Possibly. She stinks of booze. Really? Um. Any idea when she died? Well, the dashboard clock is stopped at 1:26 AM. But the loss of heat from the body doesn't seem to fit. So she wasn't necessarily killed by the crash. Um. What's happened? WYCLIFFE: It's all right. It's all right. Let him go. What's happened? Let me see! WYCLIFFE: Now I'm sorry, Mr. Keir, I'm sorry, but-- apparently your wife's been involved in some kind of accident. Oh-- oh my god. Oh my god. You said that you'd do everything. You did nothing. If you'd have got the money, she would have been alive. [music playing] Why didn't you tell me, Simon? Because the job just came up. Look, their reporter-- the local reporter's ill. Reporting dog shows and garden parties is one thing. Look, I can't turn down the opportunity. I can't do it. This could seriously compromise my situation. No, no, it won't. I promise you it won't. Um. White, no sugar, ma'am. Thank you. Can, uh-- we help you, sir? No. Flash customer. Spot the designer labels, did you? So that's Simon. Ah, lover's tiff, eh? Yeah. The course of true love never runs smooth, eh, sarge? How would you know, Potter? There's two things that don't fit. No attempt to wait for the ransom money. Don't ride the horse. Why? Well, what if Alison Keir staged her own disappearance? Little development, sir. Forensics have gone over Mrs. Keir's car. Apparently the accelerator cable has been jammed wide open. Full throttle. Deliberately. She weren't driving the car. It was driving her. They also found this-- an address of some sort of holiday cottage. Where did they find this? On the back of the seat in the car. [inaudible] clue, eh? Check it out, [inaudible] Yes, ma'am. It may be a clue. It's maybe a message. Message? Whoever's behind this is clouding the issue right, left, and center. It's something to do with them bloody stables. Why don't we turn them over? All right, Doug. Get a warrant. DOUG: Come on, Potter. Now we're looking at murder. Let's dig. You're going to run him in the Open then, boss? Yes. Are you sure he's fit, Mr. Keir? Oh, yes. But what about the warning in the ransom note? We run. It's what Alison would have wanted. We'll do it for her. We'll do it and nobody's going to stop me. And I ride. Oh, no. I'll be riding him. That's ridiculous. No way. I've ridden in the final before. I think I have to do this. You're in no state, boss. It's Alison's horse. Nobody else rides him, understand? The Warrior needs strong handling. Don't you do this to me. I qualified him. It's my right. Eight years I've mucked out in this place and I still get treated like dirt. It would be really great if you could help us, sir. I appreciate, uh-- it's-- it's uh, tragic-- Yes, fine. Yeah. Could-- just take what you want. Um. Paperwork, books, that sort of thing. Is that OK? - Yes. Certainly. Just-- just take it, yeah. - OK. Thanks. Potter, start over there. Inspector, uh? Yeah? I think there's something I should tell you. DOUG: Fire away. When Superintendent Wycliffe asked me about life insurance cover on my wife, well, I told him there was none. Yeah? Well, in conversation with my solicitor, after I'd heard about Alison, you know-- being-- being found-- he mentioned something to me which I hadn't realized. But apparently, our mortgages include a mortgage protection scheme. So what does that mean exactly then? Well, it seems on the demise of either myself or my wife, the mortgage outstanding is cleared. So, uh, how much is it worth to you, then? Well, uh, probably upwards of something like 200,000 pounds. And you say you were unaware of this benefit, yes? Well, yes. I swear to you. Alison handled that side of things. I had no idea, you know. I had no idea at all. Well, it does put a different complexion on things, sir, doesn't it? Well, yes, I suppose it does, yes. Will you excuse me please. Sir. Take it. Definitely not your straightforward road crash, Charles. Yeah, we were aware of that. The deceased has abrasions to both wrists consistent with being tied up, blue fibers under the fingernails and some interesting contusions in the mouth area. - Interesting. Oh, they're consistent with the introduction of a foreign object into the mouth-- a gag or a weapon of some sort. But more interesting yet, we've had the vital organs and fluids report back. How's your toxicology? Try me. Well, you know the old Cornish Navy tradition of the press gangs-- how they'd pay an innkeeper to put knockout drops in a man's drink. In no time at all, he'd be three sheets to the wind-- then the press gangs would whisk him away to a life on the ocean waves. Knockout drops? Chloral hydrate. It's a highly soluble liquid. Odorless. Matched with alcohol in sufficient quantities, a lethal little cocktail. She was given that? Brain swollen. Lungs congested. According to the report, she was swimming in the stuff. I should have said drowning. So she was dead before the car crash. Oh, if the tree hadn't got her, the poison most certainly would have. And-- and-- and-- and the contusions to the dead woman's mouth, but could they be caused by a bottle? Um-- in other words, uh, could she have been force fed this mixture? Mm. It's possible. It's a bizarre way to kill someone. Keir's typewriter had to ribbon cassette in it like this one. Now, if I pull that out, you can see that each letter has been punched out of the tape by the keystroke. Reads like a book. What we have here-- is a photocopy of the ribbon in Keir's machine. Blown it up twofold, cut it into line length strips-- clear as day. The ransom notes were definitely written on Mr. Keir's typewriter. Thank you. RACE ANNOUNCER: With two fences to go, it's Dee's Delight, just in the lead [inaudible] from the railing. [inaudible] third. Over second last, but there's a fall [inaudible] Dee's Delight, [inaudible] coming over the finish now, Captain [inaudible] crossing the line third with [inaudible] second and [inaudible] Revenge in third. First, number 12-- second, number seven. Third, number two. First, number 12-- Dee's Delight. Second, number seven, [inaudible] [crowd chatter] RACE ANNOUNCER: And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to look forward to the most important race [inaudible] the [inaudible] of this year's Southwest Cornwall [inaudible] MAJOR TREGELLES: David, where the hell have you been? RACE ANNOUNCER: The winner will receive the prestigious-- MAJOR TREGELLES: Now remember. Hold Paladin up til the last two furlongs. Then kick for home. David Penryn here? DIANA: No. They took Greek Warrior to the point to point. I'm heading down there now. You say they? DIANA: Him and Mr. Keir. - Point to point? DIANA: Yeah. - Would you get in please? Show us how to get there? DIANA: OK. [music playing] What are we looking for sir? Oh, we'll find-- Watch out! You all right? Yeah. [music playing] RACE ANNOUNCER: In the parade ring, the jockeys are now mounting their horses for the time of this year's Southwest Cornwall Hunt Open. In the brown and gold collars-- Are you expecting trouble in this race? I'm not sure. We need to talk to David Penryn, though. He's over there. Sir, the Tregelleses. WYCLIFFE: Have you spoken to him? LUCY: No, but-- I wouldn't rule Major Tregelles out. There's obviously no love lost between him and Alex Keir. WYCLIFFE: Somebody's been settling old scores, but who or what, I don't know. So, uh, who last booked the cottage? A family-- Mr. and Mrs. Baker. They took it for the whole of this month. - Uh, Baker, did you say? - Yes. They paid by check. So do you, uh, see them down here much? No, no. Our company's based in Camborn. They picked up the key themselves. From here. Not very good security, madam. We find it quite a good system, actually. Saves me running all over Cornwall on changeover days. RACE ANNOUNCER: The runners are on their way up to the start for the final of the Southwest Cornwall Hunt Open. Number 25, Greek Warrior, 4 to 1 second and favorite-- was an impressive winner last time down there in the qualifiers [inaudible] Gregory Tregelles on the 5 to 2 favorite, Paladin, will be attempting to bring the [inaudible] Trophy home to his father's stables for a third time. Will you be much longer? RACE ANNOUNCER: They're under starter's orders. They're off. First show is number three, [inaudible].. Then six, [inaudible]. Nine, Mara's Mixture. 10, [inaudible].

[music playing] It's got Keir's name in it. Wasn't it blue fibers they found underneath her fingernails at the postmortem? Yep. RACE ANNOUNCER: Making the final turn towards home, it's Paladin by two lengths from Greek Warrior, with [inaudible] and Mara's Mixture fighting it out in third, and-- Yeah? RACE ANNOUNCER: Greek Warrior now into the lead. [inaudible] - Yeah. Cheers, Lucy. RACE ANNOUNCER: --the second last. [inaudible] five furlongs to go. It's Greek Warrior, holding on Paladin-- Keir's coat? What's the boss playing at? [music playing] Warrior! RACE ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] They're over the last now.

RACE ANNOUNCER: [inaudible] as ridden by Gregory Tregelles. The winning distances are four lengths and-- DOUG: Ivy Cottage, Mr. Keir, is a holiday let 40 miles north of Delverton. You booked it in the name of Baker, didn't you? I've never heard of the place. Now your coat was found there. I've told you I lost that coat. It was stolen from my car. Did you report it stolen? No, I mean, it was an old thing. What was the point? The police never find anything. Well, we have now. In this cellar where your wife was held. I'll put it to you again, Mr. Keir. Did you kidnap Alison Keir and keep her in that cellar? No. Well, somebody did. You typed the ransom letters on your typewriter, and you posted them to yourself, didn't you? No. This is ridiculous. You rigged the death of your wife to make it look like a car crash, didn't you, Mr. Keir? I loved Alison. I couldn't have harmed her, not in a million years. Somebody killed Alison and then they tried to kill me in the race. My stirrup leather had been cut through. I'd do that myself, is that what you think? I think we should stop here. Take a break. Interview suspended, 20:02. [music playing] DOUG: What's happening, sir? WYCLIFFE: Get in the car, Doug. Let's go. The car crash, Doug. Why was Alison Keir killed in that way? DOUG: I don't know, sir. It's a bit odd though, isn't it? Remember, Alex Keir had a spent conviction for drunk driving eight years ago? Yeah? Well, I got a collator up north to look up his card. Apparently, he and Alison Keir were involved in a crash. Two people in the other car were killed-- Mr. and Mrs. Sykes. Keir got off death by dangerous driving on the grounds that-- Yeah, that he was too drunk to be deliberately dangerous. WYCLIFFE: Usual loophole. Yeah. But there was a third passenger in Mr. and Mrs. Sykes' car-- their daughter, Angela. She survived. And? She would have been 14 at the time. 22 now. [music playing] A young woman. Go easy him. He had a hard race yesterday. [music playing] Angela! DAVE PENRYN: Hey, what's going on? Where's that track go? Over at [inaudible] [music playing] There she is. Angela Sykes-- you are Angela Sykes, aren't you? [music playing] My name is Diana Byrne. Angela, we have your real passport. My name is Diana Byrne. You kidnapped Alison Keir, didn't you? Typed the letters. Stole Mr. Keir's coat. When did you first get involved with horses, Diana? I have a daughter. She's nearly your age. She was horse mad when she was a kid. Was it-- was it the same with you? Yes. You were very close to your parents. How old were you? 14. We ran off the road. WYCLIFFE: Go on. Then-- my mother died in my arms. And he-- Keir-- he lied. He stood in front of the jury and he lied. And they let him go. Yes, I know. Him and Alison. They had their lives. Everybody forgot about me. I had nothing. And that hurt. I swore then. I swore they wouldn't get away with it. And so you killed Alison Keir, didn't you, Angela? And then you tried to kill her husband by, uh-- cutting the stirrup straps. That's right, isn't it? Yes. It was here inside, all the time. It never went away. [music playing] I hated them. Greek Warrior. I'm sorry? You know, the Trojan horse? Oh, yeah. They took it in. They didn't know. Inside, just waiting to destroy them, like they did to me. Alison deserved to die.
