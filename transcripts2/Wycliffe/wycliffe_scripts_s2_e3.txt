 Wycliffe (1994–…): Season 2, Episode 3 - Charades - full transcript 
 David and Angela Miller are shocked to find the corpse of Ezra, a local villain, nailed to the back door of their holiday home. Suspicion falls on another local boy Gary Penhale, whose family once lived in the Millers' house and has been sending them peculiar threatening notes. Overly helpful Colin Drake, who has the hots for Lucy Lane, also contributes damning evidence against Penhale. But the knowledge that Angela was the recent victim of a hit-and-run, and that she is the moneyed half of the couple, whilst her husband's business is floundering, causes Wycliffe to look elsewhere.

 [car door closing] BOB: Hi, officer. DETECTIVE WYCLIFFE: Bob. BOB: Bit of an odd one, eh? Never seen anything like it. He's been nailed up. Gave me the creeps when I first saw it. It's like it's religious or something. Yes. I see what you mean. DETECTIVE INSPECTOR LANE: Well, we know who he is, local man, Ezra Treglowen. Gunshot wound to the chest, close range. There's also this head wound.

 MAN 1: We've got some, uh, trainer prints, sir. Pretty fresh. Bit of a shock to find him like this. We'll miss him. He was always worth a couple of convictions a year. What for? Usual. He was breaking and entering before he was out of short trousers. In fact, I've known him off and on since he was at Boston. Any particular enemies? Not that I know of. He wasn't a type. INTERVIEWER: We can talk about this another time if, uh, that's better for you. No, let's get it over with. This all work for you Ms. Miller? Yes. Yes, whatever you like. Right. So um-- so what time did you get here? Oh, I'd say about two. We always set out early to avoid the worst of the Friday traffic. INTERVIEWER: From? Somebury, and four and five straight down. It's not a bad trip. I'm Detective Superintendent Wycliffe. DAVID MILLER: David Miller. My wife, Angela. Don't mind me. Just carry on. INTERVIEWER: So uh-- so you got here about 2:00. And when did you discover the body? Soon after. We were just unpacking a few things, Angela went into the kitchen, and there he was. Oh. You found the body, Mrs. Miller? Do either of you know who he is? DAVID MILLER: No. No idea. Well we haven't, uh, formally identified the body yet, but, uh, we think his name is Ezra Treglowen. Does that mean anything to either of you? No. So you never heard of him or seen him before? DAVID MILLER: No. - Yeah. Well, that takes care of that. Um-- It's a lovely house. Must have taken a lot of work. Yeah, over the years. I'm an architect, so-- Yes. Well, it's a good advertisement then. Um, you got a good view of the place from the road. Have it been broken into? No, but the securities-- well, I built it all in myself obviously. Now, our neighbor's, the house, I don't know how many times-- which is funny really because that place is such a tip. If I was a burglar-- Yeah, I'm morphling. I'm sorry. This is all a bit-- No, no, no. That's-- that's all right. - Yes, yes. Not much more. How often do you come down here? As often as possible. Sometimes two or three times a month. INTERVIEWER: And the last time was? About five weeks ago in the middle of last month. Did anything out of the ordinary happen then? DAVID MILLER: What do you mean? You mean, did we find a body at the kitchen door? We got more of those notes. TRANSCRIBER: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Notes. Bits of paper pushed through the door. Well, I don't think that's got anything to do with it. What sort of notes? It's a lot of fuss over nothing. Signs all the same. Have you still got them? One. Could we, uh-- I'd asked her to throw them away. It's so ridiculous. Will you put it on the table please? It's obviously the work of a crank. And this wasn't the only one you say? Yes. One just the same and others saying we're watching you. There are people that don't like outsiders. That's all it is. Frankly, I can't see they'd be stupid enough to murder somebody. What about the time I was nearly run over? That was deliberate. Oh no. Not again, please. It was nothing. MAN 2: Excuse me, sir. You're wanted downstairs. If you're asking me, this could be interpreted as some kind of threat. I'm not being pushed out of my home by anyone. Well, until we know a little more I would suggest that you both move somewhere else. That's ridiculous. No, I'd like to. I don't want to stay here. Oh. We're, uh, staying at the local hotel. Um, I'm sure they could put you up until you find something more suitable. Darling? All right. All right. If that's what you want just till this is sorted out. [music playing] Thanks. Grace, tell me about Ezra. GRACE: Ask your law. They saw more of him than than I ever did. We just want to find who did it. He was all right. He got into trouble, fights and that, but he was good. Do you know what I'm saying? Yes. No, you don't. He got a record, he was marked out. Every time he tried to do anything with his life it was like he had it stamped on his forehead, criminal. He was treated like a criminal, so that's what it turned into. No one give him a chance. Did he have a job? He applied for high Sheriff of Cormor, but he didn't get it. What I meant was, did he have any income? Not that I saw. He liked the horses and the cards, spent his life in the bamboo. No income, only outcome. Did he owe money to anyone? Course he did. But he never said how much and he never said who to. DETECTIVE INSPECTOR LANE: Why? Because they billed him. That's why. BARTENDER: Weren't just this pub. Treglowan used to drink all over the place. Yeah. But when he was in here, did he drink with anyone in particular? Can't say he did. Was he ever involved in any trouble? BARTENDER: No. Right. Thanks for your time. BARTENDER: No problem. COLLIN: Hello. I haven't seen you here before. That's because I haven't been here before. Can I buy you a drink? No, thank you. My names' Collin. Really? How nice for you. Excuse me. [car going fast over pavement] DONALD WAINWRIGHT: Good evening, madam. Good evening. Uh, Detective Inspector. Ah, yes um, Ms. Lane. I'm the hotel manager, Donald Wainwright. May I say what a pleasure it is to have you here at the Hydro? Your colleagues are all on the same floor, the first, all with a sea view. Dinner commences at 6:30. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Thank you. DONALD WAINWRIGHT: Enjoy your stay. It's all right, love. Don't get your poor mother out of the bath. Just give her this number, and tell her I'll ring her again tomorrow. So how are you? Truro? I don't know. I might be. Well I'll see. You're developing very expensive tastes, young lady. Come on. [inaudible] [beep] Hi, it's Lucy. Just thought I'd give you the number of the hotel in case you wanted to phone me or leave a message. It's 01-872-572-101. And I'm in room 29. OK. Bye. [music playing] I think it's lovely. Let's make the most of it. Please? What's the future for a place like this, hey? If it's not full even in high season? Everyone's in their holiday homes. MAN: Could you just-- where is the head waiter? Please [inaudible]. Excuse me, could you come here, please? I'm simply not having this plate of food given to my wife. It is freezing. Well don't just stand there. Just please, could you take it away? What do you make of them? Well they're pretty typical I'd say. Do you think so? Hmm. We were lucky. The bullet was lodged in his spine. So you're looking for a 303 rifle. And some very old cartridges. Well, like an old Lee Enfield? Looks like it. He was shot at close range, under two feet. So your killer was taking no chances. What about the head wound? A lump hammer. Two inch radius. I'd hazard he was already unconscious when he was shot. What makes you say that? Well the victim was lying on his back. So the killer stood over him, and then shot him. Well it looks like it. Where did he die? It appears that Treglowan was killed about four days ago, then he was taken to the farmhouse, and nailed up there the day before he was discovered. That sounds as though whoever did it knew when the Millers were going to arrive. Could be a coincidence. Yes, sir, but if he was nailed up-- Yes, yes. It does look like a threat. Which brings me to this. Has anyone seen one of these before? I've never set eyes on one. [snorts] Well I know it's not [inaudible].. They're legit, and it's not their style. Could be a local with a grudge against newcomers. Hm. I'll check that than. [phone ringing] Right. Thank you. I'll take the Millers. There's a link there. We just haven't seen it. That's all. OK, that's it. It's a new one on me. You got any local activists? I don't know. You could try-- what's that bloke called, Henry? You mean Thorne, sir? That's the fella. Donald Thorne. Usually catch him in the miners' arms. Catch him doing what? Just holding fort, that sort of thing. Seems harmless enough to me. Matter of fact, some of the lads thinks he talks a lot of sense, especially when the road starts jamming up. Maybe it's not working, sir. [knocking] CHILDREN: Who is it? Who is it? It's [inaudible] MAN: [inaudible] I'll see Hang on. Just [inaudible]. CHILDREN: [inaudible] Oh, hi. [inaudible] [inaudible]. No, it's not Uncle David. Now go on, scram, the lot of you. Sorry. What can I do? - Mr. Howell? - Yeah. I'm Detective Superintendent Wycliffe. This is Detective Sergeant Dixon. Can we come in, please? Yeah. Oh, no, it's not Uncle David. MAN: Darling? Oh, watch where you put your feet. Oh, don't worry. It's only chocolate mousse. My wife, Georgina. Georgie, it's the police. Something awful has happened to David and Angela's. They found a body. Hey, wait for me. Outside. Come on. Outside, now. CHILDREN: Oh, Dad. Yes, when Mr. and Mrs. Miller arrived yesterday, they found the body at the back of the house. Well that explains why he hasn't been over. Was it an accident, or-- No, it's a murder investigation. Has nothing to do with David and Angela, obviously. Well that's what we're trying to establish. How long have you known them? Since he first moved here. Yeah, it must be 10 years now, at least. I'm sorry, it's a bit of a shock. I mean, you don't really expect murder around here. That's the whole point. Who was it? He's a local man called Ezra Treglowan. No. So tell me about the Millers. Well, everyone will tell you the same thing. David's just great. He adores the kids, and-- well, he's like an uncle to them. They love him. He never misses their birthdays. It was Toby's yesterday. That's why they were expecting him. And Angela. She's wonderful. Very kind. What about Mr. Miller's company? I don't know much about that. Doing well, though. Must be. I mean, those two rake it in. Marcus. Well, it's true. Actually, I think Angela's the one with the money from her father. What's Mr. Miller's company called? - Oh god, what is it? - Miller Project Consultants. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. They were going to come up with some work, but we-- we never got around to it. [knocking] Down flow drying up. CHILDREN: I'll get it. Have you seen anyone suspicious hanging around the area? CHILDREN: It's Uncle David. Nay, sir. UNCLE DAVID: Yes! [inaudible] Not me. CHILDREN: Uncle David! I'm sorry, I didn't realize-- That's all right. No. We'll go into the other room. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. You stay here. It's funny. We were just talking about um-- UNCLE DAVID: All right. It's all right. It's all right. CHILDREN: Uncle David! Now, look. This one's for Toby. Now you've all got something. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That one's for-- for you. It's nice to see such enthusiasm, isn't it? It's good psychology, though. It's a big lad's birthday, but give them all a present. David's very thorough. Must've set him back a few bob. It's only money. Doesn't make people happy. Try telling that to my two. Do you love them? CHILDREN: That's not his. [inaudible] Yes, I do. Well, that's all that matters. CHILDREN: Sir. [inaudible] present for them? [inaudible] What is it? Sorry, sir. Where'd this come from? Toby did it. Why? Toby? Yup. Where'd you find this? On the doormat. I thought you'd drawn it. Just a bit around the outside. Now this red bit, here. Did you do this? No, that was there already. Yahoo! What is it? DETECTIVE WYCLIFFE: Looks like blood to me. It's no good saying that tourism is in an industry. What does it produce? Chaos. We used to produce things. We used to produce tin. We used to produce copper. We used to build ships once upon a time. Now that's industry. Not selling ice cream to a lot of foreigners who don't give a damn about our future. Well they bring money in. My next door neighbor sold his property for loads more than it's worth. That's fine if he wants to give up and move out. But what about our future? What about his children, or your children? Can they afford property anymore? No. Our local youngsters born and bred in Cornwall will be driven out by yuppies buying holiday homes. Do you think that's fair? Anyway. Who's for another drink? Excuse me, Donald Thorne? Who wants to know? Detective Inspector Kersey. What can I do for you? Yeah. Um, I wondered if you'd help us with this. Do you know what that is, [inaudible]?? Does it mean anything to you? No, but I know somebody who might. [inaudible] The police officer here wants to know if-- uh-- if we've seen one of these before. They're being delivered to holiday homes. We believe it could be some sort of threat. Wow. Can't be anything to do with us, then. Don't get me wrong. I want Cornwall for the Cornish, but only by legal and legitimate means. Sure. I can't say fairer than that now, can I? [music playing] Are you sure you haven't seen this man? I haven't, I'm afraid, no. Thanks very much for your help. Thank you. Hello there. You're a police officer. I didn't realize. I left my uniform at the dry cleaners. You investigating this Treglowan business? Yeah. Well maybe I can help you. I'm a bit of a detective myself on the sly. Are you saying you have information? Maybe, maybe not. How about discussing it over a cup of tea? Ian? Oh, I don't think it'll need the three of us. Gary Penhale. That's your man. Why do you say that? Because I know. That's why. He's Treglowan's brother-in-law. Treglowan made his sister's life a misery. That's what Gary's told me, many a time. Did he ever say he wanted to kill Treglowan? Can't really recall. Maybe. This is just hearsay. For all I know, you might have a grudge against Penhale. What? He's a mate. I'm only telling you what I've heard with my own ears. What other evidence is there? That's for you to find out. Treglowan was shot, wasn't he? Well Gary's got a rifle. He keeps it under his bed. How's that? I think we need a little more than that. No. My treat. If you have anything more concrete-- Oh, I'll find something I'm sure. Young, willing, and able. That's my motto. So when are you off duty then? Do you know the reason why CID officers wear plain clothes? It's because we're never off duty. I'll see you around. [phone ringing] Animal blood, not human. Matched the fingerprints. All from small children. Not much help there, I'm afraid. I've just found a contact at the MET. He had a bit of a dig around, and according to him Miller Project Consultants are a small loft conversion firm. [phone ringing] And they're in big financial trouble, which is not the picture I've been getting at this end. MAN: Excuse me, sir. There's a call for you. What about this Penhale business? Depends on how much you trust your contract. Looked to me like he wanted to develop a close working relationship. Yeah, but what's Penhale's link with the Millers? Yeah, you're right, Doug. Murdering your brother-in-law's one thing, but nailing him up at the door of a complete stranger is quite another. That was Mr. Howell. Come on Doug. We'd better get down there. Yeah, he was in those bushes looking up at of the house. I went out to challenge him, but he disappeared, thankfully. Georgie thought she saw him again later on. If you don't mind, I think we should stay here tonight. See what happens. Doug. Hey? You take him. [inaudible] Ah, Ms. Lane. This arrived for you. Obviously have an admirer. And may I say, this comes as no great surprise to me. From Simon, is it? No. My informant. Oh. Quite the local Romeo, your Mr. Drake, isn't he? What's he want now? He has more information for me. Over dinner is this? Doug, shut up. Thanks for agreeing to all this, Mr. Miller. Anything to help. How is business? How do you mean? Well I just wondered, you know. I've got a friend who's a surveyor, and things have been a bit tight for him recently. Luckily I'm not a surveyor. No. So um, what sort of work do you do, architecturally speaking? Oh, anything that comes up. Hotels, office blocks, houses. Depends what people want. Sounds interesting. It's a pity the conversion fell through at the Howell's place. Looks like they needed the extra bedroom, all those kids running about. They seemed very pleased to see you. Before you ask, we couldn't have any. I wasn't going to ask. Well everyone else does. So there you are. Now you know. Here you are. Cup of coffee. Thanks very much, Mrs. [inaudible].. OK. Sir, somebody's just had a look at this place. They're cutting through the field at the back and heading in your direction. [music playing] [glass breaking] Go. Go. What's your name, young man? I wasn't doing anything. Your name. Gary Penhale. Good old Thorne's young friend, aye? Get up. Here you go, sir. Thank you. All right, Mr. Penhale, I want you to come with us, ask you some questions. You can't make me. I know the law. Very well. If you insist. Gary Penhale, I'm arresting you for criminal damage. You do not have to say anything. But what you do say, will be taken down and used in evidence. I'm just a delivery boy for Mr. Thorne. That's all. And not a very good one, Gary. You see, we checked around the area, and most of the weekenders don't seem to have been visited by you. But the Millers-- well you just can't keep away, can you? Why is that then? What happened there has nothing to do with me. You really want them out, don't you Gary? In view of the time I think my client could do with some food and a rest. He broke a window for god's sake. You can't hold him on a charge of criminal damage. Bail him. Listen, all I'm saying, it could be a lot more serious than it looks. So go ahead and make it more serious if you've got the evidence. I'll see you later. Well, well, well. What an unexpected pleasure. I got your message. If you have any more information-- First things first. It's nearly closing time. What are you having? I can't stay. All work and no play. What do you do for fun? I arrest people. What about Penhale? You arrested him? You said you have more information. Yeah. Well I've been having a think. When did Treglowan die? If you can tell me that, then I can probably tell you what Penhale was doing that night. And have you checked his rifle yet? We'd like to. The thing is, we're only holding him on criminal damage, so we can't search for a murder weapon. You need more evidence, right? Well how's this? I've got his motive. Apart from hating Treglowan, it's all to do with that house. Go on. Penhale and his sister grew up there when it was a farm. Old man Penhale sold it off dirt cheap, just before the boom, because he was in debt. Now Miller came along and spent a load of money on it, changed everything. Gary's been bitter about it ever since. He reckons it ought to be his. Well he's got to be the killer. It's got to be Penhale. So your informant is claiming that Penhale killed Treglowan because he was making his life a misery. Mhm. And then nailed him up at the farmhouse to scare off the Millers. Yes, sir. Two birds with one stone. I can understand his obsession with the building, but is the lad really a killer? But if we arrested him for murder-- We could test the gun, I know. There's something wrong here. The Millers are involved somewhere. I can feel it. I still think we should go with Penhale. At the moment, he's all we've got. Well OK. You win. Give it a try. Sarge? We've tested your client's rifle, and it's the same gun that killed Ezra Treglowan. The rifle was lying under the bed for anyone to use. Unlicensed and contravening firearms regulations, I know. But you have no proof that Gary fired the shot that killed Treglowan. We have the trainer print. His trainer print. Gary doesn't deny that he's been to the Miller's farmhouse delivering those notes. The print was fresh, though. If you'd been more specific about the time the murder took place, I'm sure we could account for Gary's whereabouts and clear this up once and for all. He's right. Gary, we need to know what you were up to last week, Monday to Thursday. Now that's every hour of the day and night. Easy. I was at work all day. I got witnesses for that. And I was out drinking every night until I was unconscious. I couldn't have fired a water pistol. Ask anyone. Who were you drinking with? Bloke called Collin Drake. Did you talk to Drake about Treglowan? Yeah. Did Drake ask you about him? He seemed interested that we didn't get on. Did Mr. Drake know where you kept the rifle? Yeah, he did. Interview terminated by Detective Superintendent Wycliffe at 15:11. Thank you, Gary. I'm going to release you on police bail. You'll be charged with causing criminal damage, and you will also be charged with offenses under the Firearms Act. You will not be charged with murder. [thud] Don't. You think I'm wrong about them, Ellis? I never said a word, sir. It's just a feeling, that's all. Something's not right. Yeah. Well I can see they're not happy. But then what couples are? It's just a matter of time. Did you enjoy your meal? Yes, thank you. I'm delighted to hear it. I'm also delighted to say that last night at the [inaudible] entertainments night. It's one of the hotel's longstanding traditions. We find it helps to-- to bring people together. I have a prior engagement. Doesn't surprise me at all, Ms. Lane. Have a good evening. Um, what sort of entertainments exactly? Parlor games, that sort of thing. The older guests loved it. They'd be so disappointed if you didn't join in. And so would I. I'm very persistent, Mr. Wycliffe. I won't take no for an answer. Are the Millers interested? Oh, I believe so. Then so are we. [applause] Film, and it's one word. One word, did he say? Swing? Sway? MAN: Patrick Swayze. MAN: That's not a film. Well, swing isn't a film either, is it? Wobble. Wobble? What sort of films do you go to then? Yeah, but that's what she's doing. She's-- she's wobbling. I give up. It's very good, but I give up. No stamina. Um, rigid. [clanging] Looks like it's my lucky night. You know, you've got beautiful hair. So I'm told. In fact, you're not bad looking all around. Shame you don't make more of yourself. [laughing] You seem to spend your life in this place. No, not all my life. I do other things. Like what? That'd be telling. What do you do for a living? This and that. Meaning? This and that. You wouldn't have to tell anybody you're a police officer, would you? Always asking questions. Still, I suppose that's what you do for a living. I thought about it myself once. I like the idea of tracking someone down, having them in your power. [inaudible] like that when you know they've done it. All you've got to do is prove it. Make it stick. That's just what it's like. I'd be good at that. I was right about Penhale, wasn't I? Actually, he's been released on a technicality. What technicality? That he didn't do it. What? I do all the work, I serve him up to you on a plate. I don't believe it. He did it. There wasn't enough. Have you checked the rifle? Yep. And? It was the murder weapon. Well there you are. What more do you need? He had motive, opportunity-- What do you mean, opportunity? Didn't you check up? He was at work all day, and drinking all night with you. At least that's what he said. Yeah, that's right. That's why I know he did it. How do you know? It's too late now, isn't it? You've let him go. We can always re-arrest him if we get the evidence. Yeah, sure. How about coming in and making a statement? What? Down the nick? It's voluntary, of course, but if you've got hard evidence that would convict Penhale, then we'd like to hear it. And if you haven't, we're still looking. It's like you were saying, it can be very satisfying tracking someone down, especially when you know they've done it. All we have to do is prove it. [phone ringing] Yes? Right. Was that the phone? No. That's him. [car starting] [music playing] DETECTIVE INSPECTOR LANE: Morning, Collin. [knocking] I thought you might like to know we've arrested our prime suspect. Yes. Come in. Thank you. Who is it? He's called Colin Drake. Does that name mean anything to you? No, can't say it does. Well perhaps if I showed you this photograph. It's very recent. No, I don't recognize him. Are you sure? Positive. What if I showed you this? It's not what you think. David Miller, I'm arresting you for conspiracy to commit murder. You do not have to say anything-- Darling? These magazines were hidden in the tubes. But apart from that, nothing much yet. "Singles?" That's a bit premature, isn't it? Look. It was self-defense. Treglowan attacked me first. - Why did he do that? - Oh, I don't know. He was a drunken nutter. he just went for me, and I picked up the nearest thing, a hammer. I only meant to knock him out. It was an accident. But when you found out he was dead you had to pin the blame on someone else, like Gary Penhale? What would you expect? I panicked. I knew Treglowan and Penhale didn't get on. It was easy enough to pin the blame on Penhale. So you got him drunk, took him back to his place, borrowed his rifle, and then shot Treglowan through the chest. Yeah. That's it. It was never murder. I'm sure it'll turn out to be a huge mistake. My husband isn't a murderer. You only have to look at him. Look at how he loves those children. Yeah. He's a bit tough on you though, sometimes, isn't he? That's just his way. It's nothing. I thought you looked a little upset the other night. He didn't mean it. Is there anything else you want to tell me? OK, I'll let you go on with your packing then. Yes. Packing. Tidying up. That's what I'm best at. I seem to have spent my life tidying up after him, lying for him, covering for him, pretending everything was all right. Look at these. Bank statements. Look at the money I give him. I'm not supposed to ask where it goes. But I know. I heard him on the phone one night. It was some-- it was nothing. He was talking about getting rid of a CD or something. But he sounded really urgent, secretive. Then he asked me for even more money. After he went out, I pushed the redial button on the phone, and I knew. The phone was answered by a woman called Ruth. He's-- he's having an affair. Um, I think it might be a little bit more complicated than that. Is this the phone number? Yup. Yup. It's Ruth Treglowan. And I think we know about the CD. There's a patent here. Now we're getting somewhere. Mr. Miller, was Collin Drake blackmailing you? Yes, he was. What about? He found out that I was planning to have an affair. That's why I had those magazines hidden away. Mr. Miller is referring to a selection of "Singles" magazines, IP one though IP nine, which were found this morning during a search of Penhale's farm, carried out in Mr. Miller's presence. Hardly the stuff of blackmail, though, is it? I didn't want anything to happen to my marriage. You mean you don't want a divorce? That's right. Why do you want the affair? It was just a whim. Things had gone a bit flat, you know. How did Collin Drake find out about all this? We met in a pub. We got talking. But what proof did he have that-- that-- that-- I mean, why should your wife believe him and not you? He tape recorded a conversation. DETECTIVE WYCLIFFE: In the pub? Over the phone. So you continued discussing the matter over the phone? Yes. Yes. Did you hire Ezra Treglowan to scare Drake off? Yes. And throughout these negotiations, you referred to Collin Drake by his initials, CD. That's right, isn't it? Yes. But I just wanted him to rough Drake up a bit. It all went wrong. Drake's mad and dangerous. I'm glad you've arrested him. Was this plan for an affair anything to do with your desire to have children? No. I would have liked kids, it's no secret. That we can't. I accept that. Do you? Let me read you one of the Lonely Hearts ads that you've marked. Exhibit IP four, page 68. Attractive, fit, blonde woman, 29, seeks single, healthy man for a committed relationship with a view to marriage. Now she's not after an affair, is she? Well you never know. All the ads that you've marked, are the women around the age of 30, or even younger. Women who could still have children. It's got nothing to do with it. Now you asked your wife for 10,000 pounds in cash. And just over a week later, someone tried to run her over. So? So you don't deny that someone tried to run her over, then? No, sir. Collin Drake was blackmailing you. You wanted him stopped. The matter was serious enough for you to want him beaten up. You don't do that over an affair. I told you, I can't lose my wife. DETECTIVE WYCLIFFE: Why? All right, I needed her money. Without her money, you're sunk aren't you? Yes. That's a horrible position to be in for a man who prides himself on his status, for a man who lied to me rather than admit that his businesses is in trouble. Yes. So-- so-- so-- so-- so Angela controls the purse strings. How does that make you feel? It's frustrating. Does it make you angry? Sometimes. If you could divorce her and just hang on to the money, you'd do that, wouldn't you? - Yes I would. But I wouldn't get any money, would I? So you had another idea. You met Collin Drake in the pub. You discussed getting rid of her. You paid him 10,000 pounds in cash, and just over a week later he tried to run over. It wasn't like that. But that didn't work out, did it? And so Mr. Drake soon found out there was an easier way to make money out of your blackmail, so he turned the screw. It wasn't like that. Well you tell me how it was, then. God I made a mistake. I was drunk. When I suggested it, it was a drunken-- it was a joke. I didn't think he'd do it. After I'd spoken to him again, he told me he taped a conversation when I talked about it. I was up to my neck. All I wanted to do was to stop the whole stupid business. So I hired Treglowan And the next thing I know, he's nailed to my door. Angela's in for a bit of a shock when she finds out what you've been planning. I didn't want it to go this far. It's a bit late now. [music playing] You're leaving now? Yes. I just tidied the house, and then-- Would you like a walk before you go? [music playing] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
