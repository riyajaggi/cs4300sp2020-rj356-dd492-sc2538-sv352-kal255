JULIAN: Idiot. All right, your first viewing. Allow me to be your sensei. I think the main thing to do once we're inside is to sell the property. Make it sound nice. So, for instance if there's a bedroom and it's a little bit too small, you can say, "Oh, this bedroom's really nice and it's not small." - Not small. - Yeah. Sneaky, but that's the game. Do we have to do this viewing? I wanna go college. No, no, no, I think it's good, learning the ropes... Al, imagine the car was coming out of my bum. - You can't say that in the viewing. - Sorry. Oh, shit! Hi, I'm Jean. I'm here for the flat viewing. Exactly, thank you ever so much. Sorry. I'm Al and this is Sophie. Sophie's training with me today. She's a keen bee. (HISSES) - What's that? - A bee. Julian? Erm, sorry... Should I be doing something, like letting a flat or something? What? Don't strike me! - Free punch when you let a flat. - What? Can I get you a drink or something? Sparkling water? Why's everyone trying to give me drinks? I can get my own drink. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) Sorry, can I help you, sir? - Julian... - No, Stath. Erm, do you want to come in? I can show you a wonderful, modern property with, like, a cream door. - Fucking getJulian, mate. - Oh, dear. Nice and subtle, Carl, yeah. Next time, round the back, yeah? Yeah, nice one, man. (WHISTLES) Erm, guys? So, Jean, I see you as a bit of a chef? Not really, no. (STAMMERS) Well, this is a dream for you because, look, here you could... You could cook a... A sort of, erm, a family pasta. Or carrots? Yes, or family carrots. Have you seen the oven? It's an absolute dream... -(CLATTERING) - Christ. Jean? Have you seen this bed? Do you like it? The chopping board's the pillow. - Sorry I... - I'm sorry, Sophie you can't say that... Basically she's saying that the work surface is a bed. It's very surreal. I suppose that would make the knife a hot water bottle! (CHUCKLES) Oh, wow, what an amazing room. That's nice. I'd love to see a big candle stretching up to the ceiling. Might be a nice idea. Oh, Sophie has a tissue on her head. Very cheeky. Would you like to feel the bed, Jean? It's very comfy. Rarr! (LAUGHING) Did that surprise you? I saw her get in. We were in here. Sixty-one Waltbury Close. Yes, Henrietta! You're ripping the cock off this week. That's what I'm talking about. A little line, that's all it takes. - Line? - Yeah, little bump of coke. Yes, true, true, true. Julian,just while I've got you, erm, how am I doing? OK? 'Cause I left my family and everything and I'm like... Ahhh! Mate, you're smashing it. Trust me. I've been blown away. Robbie, you too, mate. You're smashing it, trust me, I've been blown away. OK. That's lovely to hear. Anything you need. Yeah? Bit of support. Sparkling water. In fact, let's do it. Guys, Mum's away. Afternoon off! Chinese on Smethwicks. ALL: Yes! Does it have to be Chinese? We could go and have something nice? Robbie! Come on, get involved. Oh. Come on, lads! Stath, get involved. Christ... JULIAN: Come on! I didn't say I was gonna do it in a suit... When do we go off to the lunch because, yeah... I mean, I'm just kneeling, really. AL: So, shall we talk about the viewing? What, like what we thought of Jean? Er, no, no. Wait, what did you think of Jean? I loved her. She's so funny. God, yeah, such a vibrant spirit. No, what I was going to say was, I mean, the laughs in there were absolutely insania, but this is a really big opportunity for you. I don't want you to mess it up. I don't care about doin' this. I was supposed to do my clicks and claps class today at college. I know that everyone wants to do singin' and dancin' as a job, but I do as well. Wow! I mean, that is so true. It's just like all these rules and regulations... "Do this," says Papa. "Do this," says Mama. Just shut up everyone! I just want to mosh out and just... (CAR HORN HONKS) I thought that was gonna be a bit louder. JULIAN: And this... Is this really fishy and spicy is it? Yeah? Good. I like that. I'll have that for everyone. And a couple of coffees for me. Do you have anything that isn't Chinese food? You don't want food? - Chinese food. I don't think I like it. - You want drink? Is it all Chinese drinks? Oh, you want a Chinese drink? Like a hot tea? No. I want a cold drink. With ice. You want Chinese cold drink with ice? With ice, yeah. No Chinese cold drink. - So just ice. - Yes, thank you. I'll have ice. I always keep a Banksy in my car, so when I'm showing these hipster pricks around... Hippies, I hate hippies. ...I just put it on the wall. They love it. And it's sort of like the Pope, with a camera for a face. Ah, the Pope. So religion, the Pope. I actually let a flat to Banksy back in the day. Yeah, I rumbled him straightaway. He was like "Nah, nah, nah." I was like, "Yeah, come on, it's obvious." Ah, yeah, Banky, I love Banky, amazing, what a story. Yeah, well, you're welcome, for fuck's sake. Have you got a story? Yeah, erm, now? Erm, I... Yeah. OK, when I was a kid in Cyprus, erm, my dad used to make me go and get a DailyEx*press from, like, a special shop, but to get to there we had to go through like a small farm. So, on my way back from the shop I was holding the newspaper, I stopped to look at a pig, and the pig, yeah, ate the DailyEx*press. Can you imagine a thing like that? So dry to eat the DailyEx*press. - Why are you telling us that? - I dunno. Idiot. (MOBILE RINGING) Is that Tomoko? Er, yeah, it's like 12:00 in Tokyo, so shejust tells me how dinner was before bed. (SPEAKINGJAPANESE) (TOMOKO SPEAKINGJAPANESE) (CONTINUES SPEAKINGJAPANESE) - Hello. -(TOMOKO SPEAKINGJAPANESE) (SPEAKINGJAPANESE) (CONTINUES SPEAKINGJAPANESE) - Sorry about that. - It's OK. If you hit the door, it does this... (THUMPING) Amazing. (ALL CHEERING) Just give it a go. (ALL CHEERING) Are you gonna be sick? What is wrong with you? Al, the trouble trouble maker!

Bye, lads. What do you mean "bye"? Work's till 9:00 mate. Nah, nah, nah. I got a viewing, you got to drive me there. A letting? Now? Aren't you a bit squiggly? Yeah, that's the best time, though, innit? Come on, chips and dips. - Oi! - Ah, that's a shame. JULIAN: Yes, Henrietta! -(KNOCKS ON WINDOW) - Smethwicks? We're here for the viewing. - Go on. You do the tour. I'm fucked. - That's the tour? - Go on. You do it. - No, I can't do it. - Come on. - All right, all right, I'm getting out! Hello, I'm Stath. Sorry, it's fiddly. Argh... No. - Julian, do we have another key? - You broke the key? We can't get inside? Yeah. What do you wanna do? - We're gonna go home. - No. Yes. No, no, no. No, the... Basically the thing is it's a very simple flat inside. So I canjust do you like a description from outside here anyway. - A what? - Of inside, yeah. So reallyyoujust open the door and it's literallyjust a hallway, erm, with a picture on the wall like a Tudor one of an old bag with oranges and bread and all the delights of the kitchen just spilling out of it. Er, obviously it's up to you whether or not you keep that. - Would you want to keep that? - Erm, I don't know... Right, yeah. Then directly ahead of you is just some stairs. You go up them. Not too quickly, mind you, you don't want to trip and scratch your back! And then you get to the top of the stairs to the landing and it's really just a case of, er, rooms. Would that be of interest at all to any of you? It's very exciting. Or... Lads, lads, lads. I'm sorry about him. Listen, I'm sure we can show you something else, yeah... - We're gonna take it. - Yeah? We liked it online and, yeah, we can't be arsed to see another eight flats? So... OK, cool, well, what we'll do is get Henrietta -to pop over the details. - Yeah, we'll do that. Yeah, sound good? We'll get it all sorted out for you. Nice one, lads. Off you go, see you later. All right, yeah, we'll sort out all the details in the... Soon. We need to get a painting with oranges and bread from Tudor times coming out a bag. The key breaks in the door, they don't even see inside. - But they still took it. - They took it from outside. - Who's that with him? - I just chatted them into letting it. It's like, use your imagination, you can do anything. - I just talked shit about... - Julian... - What's inside for like 5 minutes. - Julian, Julian, what? They just snapped it up. Hmm? Can I have a word in privacies with you -forjust a second,just a second... - Yeah, yeah. Oi, cut the cake, celebrate the letting. Is there a cake? Get a cake.
