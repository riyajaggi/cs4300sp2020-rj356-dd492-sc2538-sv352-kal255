Look, if Stath can't make it, I'd happily take you. No. He is coming. Do you keep running ahead of me 'cause I stink? It's such a shame I wasn't allowed to have a shower at yours. You don't have to shower every day. It's a waste of time. What do you do to wash? Stand-up wash or hairspray my body and just let it crisp. - Right... -(COUGHS) I'm gonna... Oh. Right, OK. I'm going in. You wait out here, OK, so that we're staggered. I don't want them to see us, like, going in together. Look, last night it was giggles. But for me, it's like, there's work and then there's play. - Do you know what I mean? - I do know what you mean, yeah. So, yeah, you got it, chick. Oh, I forgot to ask. Did we use protection last night? Condoms? Yeah, why? Argh. Nothing. #Come overmyplace tonight #Igotthered wine on ice #I'mgonna treatyounice # Is that you getting hyped for work? - Yeah. - What are you doing out here? Yeah, I had sex with Carole last night, so I'm waiting out here 'cause we're not keeping it in the workplace. Shut up! Why? He's been there four weeks? (TUTS) I'll go in and whack him out. AL: Oh, no, you can't strike them, even if they strike you. It's tenancy law. I was actually struck by one, repeatedly. I had to just let it happen. It's PC gone M. Oh. I'll go and ask Vas what to do. I've been callin' and callin', where have you been? What you been callin' me about? - College, for my results? - Oh, is that today? You're gonna get 100 As, innit! That's howyou get a kebab from your brother. Right, well, the email said they're serving bubbly till 12:00, -so we have to go. - All right, let's go. What's bubbly? - I dunno, chocolates? - Yeah. - What? - Marcus don't believe me. Tell him. Oh! Right, yeah, go start the car, I'll be out in a second. Let's go. - Can I have the keys? - No. Are you mad? Come on. Al, come in the kitchen. STATH: I just rocked her world. Sorry, but that's the truth of the situation. At one point, yeah, I was stood just with my hands over on, like, she's got like a desk. I'm over like that just for ages, waiting and waiting and waiting. And then, we just went back to her room and had sex. How did it feel, out of 100? Oh, God! Is there such number as 200? -(LAUGHS) - Yeah. I'm just so happy for you. Thank you. Yeah, it feels... Thank you. Bloody hell! That's nice, innit? - Ah, it's great. - Him. Him! What's Carole's saying about it? Oh, last night? Well, she said quite a lot. Serious, man. She like, did this thing with my, er, willy where she was like rubbing it for ages. I was really, really loving it. Such fun. Such fun, that. At one point, we were just in bed and it was so quiet 'cause she kept telling me to shut up. And I was, like, rolling around with excitement 'cause she was asleep and I was loving every second of it. And then shejust woke up and said, "Get out!" And it's mad as well 'cause, like, obviously, I hated her and whatever, but last night when we were doin' it, I was just lookin' at her and just, like, "wife, wife, wife, wife." Nah, man, you're brave. I can't bring that side of me into the office. I'm different with girls, though, innit? I'm trouble... Oh, God. Yes, I am too. Trouble. Are you trouble, Al? Er, I don't think I am, actually. Right, Al, come on. I need to go and deal with that guy. Oh, I don't know, my hand is... I don't need your manky hand. Just can you get his info? What are you all chatting about? No, I'm just tellin' them about us having... We had sex last night. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. - Are you mad? - No. Why do you think I told you to wait outside? I thought we were doin' something weird. Are you annoyed? - Oh, my crump, man! - Mucky. - That's mucky. - It's very mucky. Where's she going? Cornelius Manor, the squatter. On her own? Alastair! Think, man! She got to go with a parkner! Remember when I couldn't be bothered to come with you to the squatter? What happened? He was bloody striking you all day, bless you! Crumbs! Parkner? - Aren't you taking Sophie, though? - STATH: Yeah, I am, yeah. Stath, I can't see your car anywhere, I've looked a day away, man. - Where is it? - I didn't drive in. Where's Carole, have you seen her? She was in her car, swearing. What about college? My results? Can you make your own way? Kebab! You all right? Don't talk. Shh! Oh, great, what are you stalking me? Great. No, I came to say sorry for tellin' people the news. I didn't know that it was a very special information to you. Shh! (WHISPERS) 'Cause he's gonna hear! - You have to go in with a parkner. - Shh! You have to go in with a parkner if it's a squatter. OK, what if he has a pole? He could bash you with the pole, bless you. I don't need help. I can look after myself, OK? My brother tried to wrestle me once and I kicked him in the head and now, he's tired all the time. - What? - I need to get him out of there, OK? And that's not gonna happen if you go in raving around like a dog, is it? OK! If I manage to get him out, OK, you lock the door behind him and then we will deal with him out here. - Yeah? - Right. - That's the plan. OK. - All right. Thank you for letting me come on this. - Brilliant, brilliant day. - That's fine. -(KNOCKS ON DOOR) - Don't knock! Why are you knocking? Because it's polite and you said I had to be calm. Right, I'm just gonna... - No, you fucking don't! - Oh, shit! - How are you swearing at my Carole, man? - We're from Michael & Eagle lettings. - Are you mad? I'll biff you out. - We just want to come in and chat. Get your body off the door or I'm gonna take it to the church, to the graves part! What are you doing? Crumbing hell! It stinks in here. Oh, God! Oh, crap! Sorry, sorry. I just got scared by the doors. Sorry, sorry. Need any help with... OK, fine... Right. Jesus Christ! Is Stath with you? Er, no, no. He got caught up in some nasty... Nasty shit, man. Er, so, yeah. - I thought I might come instead? - KATIA: There's my girl! Oh, Katia. - What did you get? - Guess! Guess! CCF! Oh, my God. I'd never have guessed that. That is what you wanted, though, innit? Er, not F, but whatever. I said to teacher CCF is like, "Cool, cool and fuck it, man". - Oh. - What did you get? Oh, my God. Three As times a million? Well done, girl, you earned it. No. I wish. I haven't even opened it yet. I was just gonna open it now. Good luck, I'm sure it'll be... - Terrifico. - Oh. (CHUCKLES) Is Stath here? - No, no, he isn't. - I don't care. - What did you get? - I don't know. It's just a lot of writing. There're no ticks or scores. OK. Well, erm... OK, it looks like there might be a clerical error. It says you haven't handed in any coursework. The writing? No, I think that was like a option. Like, if you wanted to do the writing you could or... - You didn't do it? - No. I just did the dancing. Oh, my God, did I fail? Don't worry, you can still live life, dance life. You are legally required to give me fair warning before you let yourself in that door, OK? You know what, totally agree with you, 110. Also, lovely to talk to you face-to-face, innit? Without this thing in the way! That was like something out of Blind Date that, wasn't it? Also I'm really sorry about him. - Sorry about me? - You should be. Are you mad? He was blockin' the door, girl! And by the way, it's illegal for your flat to stink so dreadfully. - Why do you even want to squat here? - Right, well, if you... What are you doing? - I want that noted, kicked! - OK, brainwave. Why don't we pop to the cafe around the corner for a giggle and a biscuit. Let the flat air out a little bit? What do you think? I don't wanna go to a cafe. I don't want a giggle and a biscuit. All that needs saying is that we had an agreed rate for this flat. And it has doubled. And now I'm confronted with a madman -letting himself in, unannounced... - What the hell? Kicking my cupboards! STATH: What the hell are you talking about? Get out the flat, you smelly boy! - Smelly boy? - No, it's rude, isn't it? No, that's not how we do things, is it Mr Roon? - Is it Roon or Rone? - Roon! Room? That should be my surname, shouldn't it? Room? I'm the one letting flats, for goodness' sake, -with rooms! - Coo, that's funny. I don't think that's funny. - Shut it! Shut the door! - Oh, yeah, yeah. - Right, yeah. - What's he doing? It's the stink of the century! I'm still in the flat. Can I come out? (SNIFFLES) I didn't get nothing, not even a score. I never have anything to tell anyone about. (SNIFFLES) I wanted to get CCC, so I can go on Britain's Got Talent and Royal Variety. (SOBS AND SNIFFLES) Stath doesn't even give a shit. He's not even gonna take me kebabs. Oh, erm... (SNIFFLING) What is it, chicken? Yeah... Actually, I don't know what it is. Everyone was speaking Greek. I think it might be something to do with a haddock or... Yuck. We could go and get another one. - OK. (CHUCKLES) -(CHUCKLES) Yeah. STATH: All right, it really stinks in here. Can I come out? Stath, can you just wait in there a minute, please? 'Cause I'm getting somewhere here. Look, Mr Roon. I'm prepared to show you some other properties within your price range. Shove 'em up your arse. All right, I swear to God I'm gonna punch you in the tongue. No, no, I meant to close it behind... Don't... Oh, my God! Do you know what? It's a relief, the smell in there... - I told you to wait in there. - I could hear the smell. I told you... Give me my keys. Just give me the keys, I have to go back in now. Wha... Key... I am... I left the keys on the floor in there. No, don't put your head and hands on the wall. Why do you keep acting like this? Being rude to me? Like we're nothing? What is wrong with you? Why are you even here? We flippin' burned last night, man! We were on flame! Together! I was like... "This is it, this is real. That's my lady for life." I wanna watch you, forever. OK? If anyone gets in the way of my eyes, I'm gonna, "move please." I know you and you felt that way, too, as well. OK, let's just... Let's just chill a little bit, mate. Erm... Oh, look, you know, yeah, last night, it was... Yeah, it was interesting. I'm not gonna deny that. But, look, my head'sjust kinda like... You know, and... Look, you know, I think you're like... Thick... And it's just quite hard to, sort of, separate myself from that. So... Look, I think it's best that you just, well, just stay away from me, erm... for the foreseeable future, I think. Well, good luck getting me back, innit? Seems like a such a shame not letting you do what you do. You've got this incredible spark. Your contribution to the arts in the UK could be so huge. Yeah. (CHUCKLES) But it's OK if nothing happens. That's just normal, innit. (MOBILE RINGING) Do you want kebab? Yeah, I ordered lamb chichi. - I think it should be here. - Lamb shish? Let me check. Stagi, man, it's done! It's not gonna bejuicy if you leave it on the hot. (SPEAKING GREEK) You want garlic sauce, chilli sauce? Er, yeah. Just as much chilli sauce as you can. You like it spicy, innit? Yeah, I've got a slightly numb tongue. It was only when I went toJapan and discovered wasabi that I could actually taste anything. So, I'm a late taster. - I'm late to the taste game. -(MOBILE RINGS) You already got a kebab? I come here to meet you, man! I'm sorry, I've got to get this. Al, today's been... Charming. Well, I'm not getting you another one. Girls, man! Always "Take, take, take", "shoulda, woulda, coulda!" I was hungry from getting my results. You already got your results? I was well lookin' forward to that. We could have gone tomorrow. No, we couldn't go tomorrow. It was only today. - I told you that. - As if! I'm family! So selfish, man! I've had a very painful day. Are you havin' a joke? How am I the selfish one? That's you! You never done one nice thing for me, never. Not in 2016, 2015, 2014. You just go 'round with me, shouting at me all day and just make me clean your earring. And you know what, yeah, you don't even know this, yeah, but you always ask me if I think you're an idiot and I say no. But I do think you're an idiot. Wow. (CLEARS THROAT) OK... I've thought about all that deep... That down stuff you said earlier... (CLEARS THROAT) I've had time to think about it. - No, it's OK. - Let me speak, Sophie! All those things you said about me, yeah, are totally wrong. I'm not like that. - Oh, my God, man. - I'm not! You said I'm never nice to you. The other day I gave you directions to the bus stop. I wanted you to give me a lift. It was pissing down with rain! I'm saying... I'm not sorry, but... It crushes me up inside to think that I'm upset you. 'Cause you're like my best friend in my life! Like, the girl of my bloody dreams, man. But I'm just saying... You got, er, good college results scores? - I failed at it. - Ah, crumbs. You sad about that then, yeah? - Sorry. - Yeah. I wanted to get a CCC at least, so I could get a job on telly. It's OK, though. Al was very supportive to me. Oh, God. I love that boy. Christ. Why'd you wanna get bloody CCC anyway? You could get anyjob you bloody want. You could do anything. A song, a acting, a joke. You got the best comedy in London, man. You could do... You could crack up the whole of Wembley, you know what I mean? Come on, tell me onejoke now, I swear to God I'll laugh. Nah, I haven't got a joke. I just had two kebabs. Onejoke now, come on. OK, actually... - I came up with this one the other day. - OK. - So, you know mirrors, yeah? - Very well, yeah. - So, imagine there was one on the floor. - Yeah. Then anyone who trod on it, is gonna look down and see up their own knickers. (LAUGHS) Oh, my days, man! That is treacherous, Sophie! What an image! To think of something... I couldn't think of something like that. Right, OK, look, you've earned a kebab. I'm getting you a treat, come on. No, I already had two kebabs and dolmades, I told you. Well, I don't know what else to get you, do I? Wait, hang on. Did you bring your swimming knickers with you? (DUCKS QUACKING) Aren't they supposed to give us like a stick or something? Yeah, that's what I thought. - Ones you push the water with. - Actually, yeah. Don't put your hands in the water. There's ants in there. I always imagined Al on a thing like this. - Like, luxury style. - Yeah. Relaxed out. (LAUGHS) - I always think of Al as luxury. - Very much. - The way he speaks is so cool. - Yeah. Like, "Hello, everyone. I'm Al". Yeah, I mean, for me, he's like the top person in London. - We're very lucky to know him. - Mmm-hmm. I love him. You fancy Al, innit? Nah, I clocked you. I got you! (LAUGHS) You fancy him. No, it's all right, I'm not... It's OK to fancy someone. Look, I actually fancied Carole earlier, but only 'cause it's polite to fancy someone if you have sex with them. Who had sex? Me and Carole, last night. Why didn't you tell me? Oh, my God, man! That is a lovely gossip! Don't! It's dangerous on the ship! (WHISTLES) BOTH: #Don'ttake themick #Justgiverespect #And one dayyou'llbe # TheKing oflovein the club # I'll meet you inside, yeah? I think I know what I have to say to her. Mmm, yeah. Oh, my God! So, are you gonna have sex with her again? I hope not. (CHUCKLES) See you in there. Tricky, OK. Carole, it's Stath. Yeah, you know that. Erm... I've had some very needed space. - I think I know what we need to do. - Yeah, it's not gonna happen. I think I just lost my head or something. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. - It might happen, though... - No. - Charming. -(CAR ENGINE STARTS) And that... Sophie, I'm tired, man. I'm going home. Tired? I passed you in my car, you were just walking around drinking water. Do you wanna come with me? We can have crisps in the living room. Stath, this is Tomoko. She come as a surprise for Al... You a customer? No, this is my girlfriend, Tomoko. Oh. You OK, Sophie? Don't say that. You... Are you nice? (THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
