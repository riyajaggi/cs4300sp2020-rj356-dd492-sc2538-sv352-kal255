 THAT'S THIS HUGE FERRIS WHEEL. HERE'S TO THE BEST YEAR EVER. I'M GONNA TURN BACK THE CLOCK  TO WHERE THE ADVENTURE BEGAN. IT WAS A COLD NIGHT  IN EAST HAMPTON. JEFFREY WAS HANGING OUT  AND READING, AND I THOUGHT  I'D MAKE HIM A COZY MEAL. IT'S WHAT THE ENGLISH CALL  BANGERS AND MASH. IT'S AN ENGLISH DINNER THAT'S BASICALLY SAUSAGES  AND MASHED POTATOES, BUT I'M GONNA DO IT MY WAY,  REALLY TURN UP THE FLAVOR. SO THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA DO  IS COOK THE SAUSAGES. I'M GONNA ROAST THEM AT 425  FOR ABOUT 18 TO 20 MINUTES, JUST UNTIL  THEY'RE COOKED THROUGH. WELL, YOU CAN'T HAVE  BANGERS AND MASH WITHOUT MASHED POTATOES, SO I'VE GOT  2 POUNDS OF POTATOES. I PEELED THEM AND DICED THEM. THEY'RE YUKON GOLD.  I THINK THEY'RE THE BEST. AND I'M JUST GONNA DRAIN THEM, ABOUT 20 TO 25 MINUTES  UNTIL THEY'RE REALLY TENDER. OKAY. AND THEN WHAT I DO IS I JUST PUT  THEM RIGHT BACK IN THE PAN. NOW HOW EASY IS THAT? OOH, THOSE SMELL SO GOOD. I LOVE THE TEXTURE  OF YUKON GOLD POTATOES. I THINK THEY REALLY WORK. SO NOW I'M GONNA ADD  ALL KINDS OF GOOD STUFF. I'M MAKING MUSTARD MASHED  POTATOES WITH LOTS OF MUSTARD. SO I'M GONNA ADD  HALF A STICK OF BUTTER, 4 TABLESPOONS... 4 OUNCES OF CRèME FRAîCHE, WHICH GIVES IT THAT SORT OF NICE SORT OF  SOUR CREAM KIND OF FLAVOR, A LITTLE SORT OF  TANGINESS I LIKE... AND SOME MILK,  ABOUT 1/2 A CUP. OKAY, THEN I'M GONNA ADD  LOTS OF FLAVOR-- MUSTARD, LOTS OF IT,  AND DIFFERENT KINDS. SO FIRST I'M GONNA ADD  2 TEASPOONS OF DIJON MUSTARD. THAT'S REALLY SPICY. 2 TEASPOONS OF COARSE MUSTARD--  IT'S GOT LOTS OF FLAVOR, AND ALSO I LOVE  THE TEXTURE OF IT. I LOVE WHEN YOU LOOK  AT SOMETHING, AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS. AND 1 TEASPOON  OF GROUND MUSTARD. THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT RIGHT. SALT AND PEPPER-- TABLESPOON OF SALT, 1 TEASPOON  OF FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER. OKAY. AND NOW INSTEAD OF  TRANSFERRING IT TO A BOWL, I'M JUST GONNA MASH IT  RIGHT IN THE PAN. SO JUST ON A LOW SPEED. WHOA. TRY AND KEEP IT IN THE PAN. THIS LOOKS PERFECT.  IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD. OKAY, TIME TO PLATE IT UP. I THINK THE SAUSAGES  SHOULD BE READY. I CAN SMELL THEM. MMM. THAT'S GONNA BE  ONE GOOD DINNER. JEFFREY, DINNER'S READY! I THINK I'LL DO THIS  RESTAURANT-STYLE, BIG DOLLOP OF MASHED POTATOES  IN THE MIDDLE... JUST LIKE THAT, A LITTLE STYLE. AND I'M GONNA CUT  EACH SAUSAGE IN HALF. JUST DO IT. I LOVE WHEN SOMETHING REALLY  EARTHY HAS A LOT OF STYLE, SO IT'S NOT JUST SAUSAGE  AND MASHED POTATOES. IT'S SOMETHING SPECIAL. AND I THINK THIS NEEDS  A LITTLE FRESH PARSLEY. WHEN SOMETHING  LOOKS LOOKS BROWN, YOU ALWAYS WANT TO GIVE IT  A LITTLE COLOR-- AND SOME KIND OF FRESH HERB,  WHATEVER YOU HAVE, CHIVES OR PARSLEY, SCALLIONS, JUST SOMETHING. JUST GIVE IT  A REALLY QUICK CHOP. JUST SPRINKLE IT ON TOP  AND ALSO THE PLATE. I THINK IT LOOKS GOOD. NOW HOW MUCH BETTER  DOES THAT LOOK? AND WE HAVE A NICE COZY DINNER  BY THE FIRE. THAT LOOKS GOOD. SO FOR DINNER I MADE YOU  BANGERS AND MASH. I LOVE THE NAME OF THAT. ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU HAD AT A WEDDING IN LONDON? I DID. AND IT WAS SO DELICIOUS.  I THOUGHT YOU'D LOVE IT. IT'S MASHED POTATOES  AND SAUSAGES. HOW ENGLISH IS THAT? IT LOOKS WONDERFUL. SO THERE WE WERE,  HAVING A LOVELY DINNER. I THOUGHT JEFFREY  WAS A LITTLE QUIET, BUT THEN HE DROPPED  A BOMBSHELL. I HAVE AN IDEA. I'D LIKE TO GET YOU SOMETHING  FOR THE HOLIDAYS, SO WHAT DO YOU SAY  WE GO TO LONDON, AND WE GO TO ALL THE PLACES  YOU'VE BEEN YAPPING ABOUT FOR THE LAST MONTH? THAT WOULD BE MY HOLIDAY PRESENT TO YOU. REALLY? YEAH. WHO WOULD SAY NO TO THAT? THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC. I'D LOVE TO DO THAT.  ARE YOU COMING? CONSIDER IT DONE. YEAH! AND THAT'S HOW WE CAME TO HAVE AN ADVENTURE IN LONDON. LET THE GAMES BEGIN. SO HERE WE ARE IN LONDON  AT LA FROMAGERIE ON OUR FIRST MORNING, EATING BACON SANDWICHES  FOR BREAKFAST. WHAT A FABULOUS START  TO OUR TRIP. IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD. YEAH, BUT DOES IT COME WITH  A HEART DEFIBRILLATOR? I'M GONNA TAKE A BITE.  YOU'RE GONNA TAKE  A BITE. OKAY. MMM. THAT'S DELICIOUS.

NOW I JUST NEED A VERY LARGE FORK, PLEASE, SO I CAN WORK MY WAY DOWN  THE COUNTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I LOVED BEING HERE.  THANK YOU. I'M DEFINITELY MAKING THE POTATOES, BUT I THINK I'M GONNA MAKE  A MIDDLE EASTERN SALAD WITH ALL OF THESE FLAVORS. I'M SO INSPIRED.  AND JEFFREY'S OUTSIDE. I KNOW SOMEBODY IS GONNA WANT  THIS CHEESE STRAW. HI, SWEETIE. HI. HOW WAS YOUR BUS TOUR? OH, IT WAS GREAT. I BROUGHT YOU  SOMETHING FABULOUS FROM THIS INCREDIBLE STORE  I WENT TO. WHAT'D YOU GET?

YEP. AND WHAT'S IN IT? IT'S GONNA BE  A WONDERFUL HEARTY SALAD PACKED WITH FLAVOR. SO FIRST I'M GONNA PLACE  TEN SCALLIONS, THINLY SLICED, WHITE AND GREEN PARTS,  IN A LARGE BOWL. THEN I ADD A POUND  OF RIPE TOMATOES, SEEDED AND 1/2-INCH DICED, HALF OF A HOTHOUSE CUCUMBER, SEEDED AND 1/2-INCH DICED, TOO. THEN I'LL ADD ONE CAN OR JAR  OF CHICKPEAS, DRAINED AND RINSED.

AND THEN I'LL JUST  TOSS IT TO COMBINE. WELL, THAT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT. AND THIS IS HOW  I'M GONNA MAKE THE DRESSING. IN A SMALL BOWL  OR MEASURING CUP, WHISK TOGETHER 1/2 A CUP OF  FRESHLY SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE, 1 TABLESPOON OF MINCED GARLIC, 2 TEASPOONS OF KOSHER SALT, AND 1 TEASPOON OF FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER. SLOWLY WHISK IN  1/2 A CUP OF OLIVE OIL, JUST TO MAKE AN EMULSION. POUR THE DRESSING  OVER THE SALAD AND TOSS THEM ALL GENTLY  TO COAT THE VEGETABLES. AND LASTLY, ADD 8 OUNCES  OF GOOD FETA CHEESE. I LIKE IT DICED 1/2-INCH,  NOT CRUMBLED. SPRINKLE IT  WITH SALT AND PEPPER AND TOSS IT GENTLY. I'M THINKING THAT'S GONNA BE  ONE GREAT SALAD, JUST LIKE THE ONES  AT I SAW AT OTTOLENGHI. WELL, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.  AND I HAVE  ANOTHER SURPRISE FOR YOU. WHAT'S THAT?  WILLIAM CURLEY AND I  MADE CHOCOLATES TOGETHER. THAT'S FOR YOU AFTER LUNCH. OOH, THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS.

OBVIOUSLY EVERY PLOUGHMAN WHO  WAS OUT PLOUGHING THE FIELDS...  OH. FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS  HAS EATEN LUNCH. SO I'M SURE THAT THEY ATE  WHAT WAS IN THE REGION, WHAT THEY HAD...  OH, THAT'S INTERESTING. AND SO CHEESE AND HAM AND BREAD  AND VEGETABLES AND EGGS WERE CERTAINLY SOMETHING--  A CLASSIC LUNCH,  ENGLISH LUNCH. IT WOULD JUST BE THERE.

BEST OF LUCK.  THIS IS REALLY HEAVY. CAN'T WAIT TO TASTE THIS.  THANK YOU. BYE, EDMUND.  THANK YOU. SEEING THOSE CHELSEA BUNS  REALLY GAVE ME A GOOD IDEA. I COULD MAKE A HOLIDAY VERSION  OF STICKY BUNS THAT WOULD SO DELICIOUS  AND RIDICULOUSLY EASY. YOU START BY COMBINING 12 TABLESPOONS  OF ROOM-TEMPERATURE BUTTER AND 1/3 OF A CUP  OF BROWN SUGAR. INTO A 12-CUP MUFFIN PAN PLACE 1 ROUNDED TABLESPOON  OF THE MIXTURE INTO EACH OF THE MUFFIN CUPS. THEN SPRINKLE  1/2 A CUP OF CHOPPED PECANS EVENLY ON TOP OF THE BUTTER  AND SUGAR MIXTURE. NOW FOR THE PASTRY-- LIGHTLY FLOUR A WOODEN BOARD  OR A STONE SURFACE. UNFOLD ONE SHEET OF PUFF PASTRY WITH THE FOLDS  GOING LEFT TO RIGHT. BRUSH THE ENTIRE SHEET WITH  1 TABLESPOON OF MELTED BUTTER. SPRINKLE OVER 1/3 OF A CUP  OF LIGHT BROWN SUGAR, 1 1/2 TEASPOONS  OF GROUND CINNAMON-- IT'S REALLY SEASONAL FLAVORS-- 1/4 OF A CUP  OF DRIED CRANBERRIES-- THEY'RE PERFECT  FOR THE HOLIDAYS-- 1/4 OF A CUP OF WHITE RAISINS, JUST TO BALANCE THE TARTNESS  OF THE CRANBERRIES. NOW STARTING WITH  THE END NEAREST TO YOU, ROLL THE PASTRY UP SNUGLY,  JUST LIKE A JELLY ROLL, RIGHT AROUND THE FILLING. FINISH ROLLING IT  WITH THE SEAM SIDE DOWN. TRIM JUST A LITTLE BIT  OFF THE ENDS OF THE ROLL, JUST TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT. SLICE THE ROLL  IN SIX EQUAL PIECES-- EACH ONE'S ABOUT 1 1/2 INCHES-- AND PLACE EACH PIECE  SPIRAL SIDE UP IN SIX OF THE MUFFIN CUPS. REPEAT WITH THE SECOND SHEET  OF PUFF PASTRY TO MAKE 12 STICKY BUNS. OKAY, SO THEN BAKE  THE STICKY BUNS FOR 30 MINUTES AT 400 DEGREES UNTIL THEY'RE GOLDEN  TO DARK BROWN ON TOP AND FIRM TO THE TOUCH. BE CAREFUL. THEY'RE REALLY HOT. ALLOW TO COOL  FOR FIVE MINUTES ONLY. INVERT THE BUNS  ONTO A PARCHMENT PAPER. YOU CAN JUST EASE THE FILLING  AND THE PECANS OUT WITH A SPOON  AND COOL THEM COMPLETELY. THAT'S MY HOLIDAY TAKE  ON CHELSEA BUNS. OKAY, BACK TO BOROUGH MARKET.  THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO SEE. THIS IS DEBBIE.  HELLO, DEBBIE. NICE TO MEET YOU. SO NICE TO MEET YOU. HI, DEBBIE.

SO TEN YEARS AGO, I THINK, IN BRITAIN-- WE LOVE CURRIES AND STUFF.  WE LIKE CHILIES-- WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS ARRAY. EVERYONE IN BRITAIN'S  GONE CHILI MAD. ALL OF THESE CONTAINERS ARE ALL ENGLISH PRODUCE. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN FOOD IN LONDON.  IT IS. IT'S REALLY UNBELIEVABLE.  CAN I TRY ONE? BY ALL MEANS.  I'M TRYING ONE, TOO. OH, NO,  YOU'RE NOT, JEFFREY. HE'S GOING FOR  THE SERIOUSLY HOT. I'M GONNA GO  FOR THE MILD. IS IT SERIOUSLY HOT?  OH! THANK YOU SO MUCH, DEBBIE. THANKS, DEBBIE. BYE.  NICE CHILI. TAKE CARE. BYE NOW.

OH, MY GOD,  IT'S GOT SO MUCH FLAVOR. IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF HEAT  BUT NOT SO MUCH. YEAH, THERE'S SOME PEPPER. IN THE MIX OF THE MEAT,  WE PUT SOME PEPPER AND HAVE THAT TASTE,  BUT IT'S NOT REALLY AS STRONG. THIS LOOKS LIKE  A PROSCIUTTO. THIS REALLY IS LIKE  A PROSCIUTTO. IT'S A CURED,  VERY THINLY SLICED-- IT'D BE GREAT WITH MELON,  WOULDN'T IT? MMM. THIS IS DELICIOUS. SO THIS IS A LITTLE MORE  LIKE A SALAMI. SOME KIND OF... THAT'S MUCH MORE MILD. YEAH.

ARE WE HAVING FUN? MM-HMM. GOOD. ME, TOO. SPANISH FUN. I THINK I'M DEFINITELY  DOING THIS AT HOME. COMING UP, IT'S THE TASTE OF LONDON  HOLIDAY LUNCH PARTY-- MY TAKE ON A TAPAS APPETIZER, A HAMPTONS' TAKE  ON A PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH, A FANTASTIC  MIDDLE EASTERN SALAD, SEASONAL SWEET TREATS GALORE, AND A GREAT SURPRISE  FOR JEFFREY. THIS IS GONNA BE  A REALLY FUN PARTY, AND YOU'RE INVITED. SO HERE I AM  BACK IN EAST HAMPTON. I'VE INVITED MY FRIENDS  FOR A HOLIDAY LUNCH. I WAS SO INSPIRED  BY MY TRIP TO LONDON, I THOUGHT, I'M GONNA DO  A TASTE OF LONDON, INTERNATIONAL TASTE OF LONDON. TOO BAD JEFFREY HAS TO WORK  SO HE CAN'T COME, BUT THIS WAY AT LEAST I GET  TO SHARE MY HOLIDAY GIFT WITH ALL MY FRIENDS. FIRST I'M STARTING  WITH THE TABLE SETTING. I WENT TO SEE MY FRIEND  WILLIAM YEOWARD. HE HAS THE MOST AMAZING SHOP  IN LONDON. HE GAVE ME SOME GREAT IDEAS. WILLIAM.  WELL, IT'S A LOVELY SURPRISE. SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU.  OH. WHAT A TREAT. AND YOU'RE OFF YOUR TURF. I AM. I'M HANGING OUT IN LONDON THESE DAYS. YOU LUCKY GIRL. SO I'M LOOKING FOR INSPIRATION. I WANT TO DO A HOLIDAY TABLE THAT'S GOT, LIKE, A TASTE OF LONDON ON IT. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?  NO, YOU KNOW,  I'M ALWAYS FRESH OUT OF THEM. NEVER.  OF COURSE I HAVE AN IDEA. YOU KNOW, INTERESTINGLY, I WAS JUST THINKING  ABOUT AMETHYSTS THIS MORNING. OH. AND I'M ALWAYS WEARING PURPLE, SO...  HELLO. SHALL WE TRY THAT? THAT'S PERFECT. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. OKAY, GREAT. I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE  WHAT HE'S GONNA DO. I LIKE AMETHYST  BECAUSE IT'S THE SORT OF COLOR THAT'S VERY EASY. IT DOESN'T SAY BOY.  IT DOESN'T SAY GIRL. BEAUTIFUL. IT JUST SAYS LOVELY.  IT'S LOVELY. IT'S MY FAVORITE COLOR, TOO. AND THEN HOLIDAY-WISE... YEAH. WHY NOT JUST DUMP A LITTLE BIT  OF SPARKLE ON THE TOP? ARE YOU DOING TWO? HOW GREAT ARE THESE?  I LOVE THESE. LOOK HOW NICE AND SPARKLY  THEY ARE. AND I LIKE BIG,  HAND-PAINTED, BEAUTIFUL... THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL. AND ALSO, ACTUALLY, I THINK  IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THERE'S A SOLID COLOR PLATE...  YES. 'CAUSE PEOPLE DO THESE GORGEOUS DECORATIVE PLATES, AND THEN EVERYTHING--YOU CAN'T FIND THE DINNER ON IT, RIGHT? IT CAN BE CONFUSING, ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE  SHORT OF SIGHT. AND THEN WHAT ABOUT--  YOU SEE HERE, WE GOT A CHOICE. SO WE CAN EITHER HAVE  THE KITCHEN LOOK OR SLIGHTLY MORE CLASSY  DINING ROOM. WHICH DO YOU PREFER?  I WOULD DO ONE OF EACH. AND THE SILVERWARE'S ALL WRAPPED UP IN THE NAPKIN, SO YOU'VE GOT THE WHOLE THING...  EVERYTHING'S INSIDE. THE WHOLE THING--FANTA-- THAT'S SO FUNNY. I WOULD THINK  OF DOING THIS FOR A PICNIC. BUT IT'S GREAT ON THE TABLE. YOU UNWRAP YOUR NAPKIN, AND THE SILVERWARE'S  RIGHT THERE.  HOW PRETTY CAN IT BE? HOW FABULOUS,  THESE WONDERFUL PURPLE GLASSES. WILLIAM, THIS IS SO GORGEOUS. DO I HAVE MY INSTRUCTIONS NOW? YEAH. DO WE THINK I CAN DO IT? JUST GO COOK. OKAY. KEEP IT SIMPLE,  KEEP IT LOVELY, KEEP IT HOLIDAY,  AND KEEP IT PRETTY. AND KEEP IT FUN.  EXACTLY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  OH, BLESS YOU.  WHAT A PLEASURE. IT'S REALLY FABULOUS TO SEE YOU.  OKAY, I'M READY TO GO. OKAY, SO TO FANCY NAPKIN RINGS, I JUST TIED EVERY NAPKIN  WITH A LITTLE LENGTH OF IVY. IT'S VERY FESTIVE. SO I THINK I'M GONNA KEEP  THIS PARTY REALLY SIMPLE. I'M GONNA DO THE TAPAS  RIGHT ON THE COUNTER, A LITTLE GLASS OF SHERRY,  SOMETHING TO EAT, AND THEN I'M GONNA PUT THE FOOD  RIGHT ON THE TABLE. I THINK IT MAKES A GREAT PARTY.  BUT NOW I'M GOING SHOPPING. I JUST LOVED THAT  PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH IN LONDON. I THINK I CAN RE-CREATE IT  FOR MY FRIENDS. THEY'RE GONNA LOVE THIS. HI, MICHAEL. HI, INA. HOW ARE YOU? SO YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED  IS SOME ENGLISH CHEDDAR... OKAY. GOOD ENGLISH CHEDDAR. I GOT A GREAT KEEN'S CHEDDAR,  SOMERSET HERE. OH, THAT LOOKS GORGEOUS. IT'S 18 MONTHS OLD. FANTASTIC.  IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN GET FOR YOU TODAY? YOU KNOW, I NEED SOME CHUTNEY  TO GO WITH IT. OH, THERE'S SOME GREAT CHUTNEYS  OVER ON THE CORNER THERE.  FABULOUS. I'LL GET IT WHILE YOU CUT.  I LOVE CHUTNEY. SHALLOTS. I THINK FIGS AND SPICES.  THAT SOUNDS GOOD. THIS IS GONNA BE GREAT AS A BASIS FOR  THE PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH. OKAY, MICHAEL, I HAVE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT  THING TO TALK ABOUT. OKAY. I NEED SPANISH HAM. OH, GREAT. WHAT DO YOU HAVE? WE HAVE THE IBERICO HAM, OR WE HAVE THE LOMO,  WHICH IS THE LOIN.  THAT'S THE ONE I LIKE. OKAY.  OKAY, FABULOUS. THANKS. I BETTER GO HOME  AND START COOKING. OOPS. THERE'S NO COOKING.  I'M JUST ASSEMBLING. FOR MY HOLIDAY LUNCH,  I'M DOING A TASTE OF LONDON. AND WHAT'S MORE BRITISH  THAN A PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH? BUT WHAT I'M GONNA DO  IS AN UPDATED VERSION. THE GOOD NEWS  ABOUT A PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH IS IT'S ALL  ASSEMBLED INGREDIENTS, NO COOKING AT ALL--  MY IDEA OF A GOOD TIME. IN ENGLAND, THEY ALWAYS DO  SOMETHING LIKE PORK PIE. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT IS. IT'S LIKE SAUSAGE  AND PASTRY OR HAM-- SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SO I'M  DOING A GOOD VIRGINIA HAM. THIS IS THE AMERICAN VERSION. I ALWAYS THINK YOU NEED  SOMETHING GREEN ON THE PLATE, SO I HAVE THESE FLAT FIG LEAVES, OR YOU CAN USE LEMON LEAVES OR WHATEVER YOU CAN GET  AT THE FLORIST. IT JUST SORT OF SETS  EVERYTHING OFF. GREEN'S REALLY IMPORTANT.  OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT? CRISP APPLES--  GREAT WITH THE CHEDDAR. SO I'M JUST GONNA PILE THEM UP  REALLY CASUAL. I SAY HAM AND CHUTNEY  GO TOGETHER, SO I'M GONNA PUT THE CHUTNEY  RIGHT NEAR THE HAM. YOU CAN USE ANY KIND OF CHUTNEY, BUT MOST OF THEM  ARE, LIKE, MANGO CHUTNEY. THEY HAVE LOTS OF SPICE  IN THEM, GREAT WITH HAM. OKAY, NEXT IS HARD-BOILED EGGS. I JUST HAVE THEM  EVER-SO-SLIGHTLY SOFTLY BOILED. IT'S REALLY A CLASSIC THING  ON A PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH. JUST CUT THEM IN HALF. THIS IS A REALLY CASUAL THING. SO NOTHING'S PRESCRIBED  WHERE IT GOES. I'VE GOT RADISHES. THESE ARE BIG, SO I'M GONNA  CUT THEM IN HALF. I THINK THEY'LL BE GREAT. I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY  INTERESTING SEEING THE WAY A PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH  IS PUT TOGETHER, THAT IT'S REALLY  JUST FRESH VEGETABLES AND SOME MEATS AND CHEESES. I'D ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT IT BUT DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY  HOW IT WAS PUT TOGETHER. I THOUGHT THAT WAS WONDERFUL.  OKAY, SO... NOW WE'VE GOT--  I'VE GOT THESE BABY CARROTS. THAT LOOKS GREAT THERE. IT'S GOT LOTS OF COLOR  AND TEXTURE. AND SOME CELERY--  WHERE ARE WE GONNA PUT THIS? IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT ARRANGING  GREAT COLORS AND FLAVORS. SO WE NEED BREAD. OKAY. I THINK PROBABLY RIGHT NEXT  TO THE CHEESE. THAT WILL BE GREAT... JUST LIKE THAT. AND GOOD BUTTER. AND THEN EVERYBODY'S  JUST GONNA HELP THEMSELVES. HOW BAD CAN THAT BE? RIGHT IN THE CORNER. MAYBE A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER,  ESPECIALLY ON THE EGGS. THEY REALLY NEED  A LITTLE FLAVOR. NOW THAT WAS PRETTY EASY. AND LOOK AT THAT.  IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, TOO. SO I'M REALLY READY  FOR MY HOLIDAY LUNCH. I CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE TASTES  OF LONDON WITH MY FRIENDS. THERE'S A BACON SANDWICH. HMM, COULD BE A MIDNIGHT SNACK  FOR JEFFERY. THEN IT'S THE FINAL INSTALLMENT OF MY FOOD ADVENTURE IN LONDON, AND, BOY, DID IT END  ON A SURPRISINGLY HIGH NOTE. DURING THE HOLIDAYS, PEOPLE HAVE  ALL THESE BIG, FANCY DINNERS. I LIKE THINGS MUCH MORE CASUAL,  SO I'M GONNA DO A LUNCH, AND I'M GONNA LET IT BE INSPIRED  BY A TASTE OF LONDON, ALL THE THINGS I SAW IN LONDON  THAT WERE JUST FANTASTIC. SO THE FIRST THING I'M DOING IS THIS WONDERFUL  MIDDLE EASTERN SALAD. IT'S GOT CUCUMBERS  AND TOMATOES AND FETA, ALL KINDS OF FRESH HERBS. I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT RIGHT  IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS PLATTER. AND THEN I TOASTED  SOME PITA CHIPS JUST TO GO AROUND  THE OUTSIDE OF IT. JUST PUT THEM IN THE OVEN-- 375 FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES  UNTIL THEY'RE NICE AND CRISP-- A LITTLE OLIVE OIL,  SALT, AND PEPPER. OKAY, THAT LOOKS GREAT. THESE ARE  THE ROSEMARY ROASTED POTATOES THAT THEY MADE AT OTTOLENGHI, AND THEY TOLD ME  HOW TO MAKE THEM. SO SLICE A LITTLE SLICE  OFF THE BOTTOM OF THEM, AND THEN YOU CUT THEM  ALMOST ALL THE WAY THROUGH KEEPING THEM TOGETHER IN LITTLE SLICES JUST LIKE THAT. AND THEN I DID OLIVE OIL,  SALT, AND PEPPER AND LOTS OF FRESH ROSEMARY. I ROASTED THEM  AT A HIGH TEMPERATURE-- 425--FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES  UNTIL THEY'RE JUST DONE. I USED YUKON GOLD POTATOES.  I THINK THEY WORK BEST. THIS IS BEGINNING TO LOOK  LIKE A LOT FOR FIVE PEOPLE, BUT I LOVE WHEN A BUFFET  LOOKS REALLY FILLED UP, SO I CAN'T HELP MYSELF. NEXT IS THE GOOD PART--DESSERT. THESE ARE HOLIDAY STICKY BUNS. THEY'RE INSPIRED BY  THOSE FABULOUS CHELSEA BUNS THAT I SAW AT BOROUGH MARKET,  AND THESE ARE MY VERSION OF WILLIAM CURLEY'S  FABULOUS CHOCOLATE LOLLIPOPS. I THINK MY FRIENDS  ARE GONNA LOVE THOSE. WHEN I WENT TO BRINDISA, THEY HAD THIS INCREDIBLE PLATTER OF ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF MEATS, BUT WHAT I REALLY LOVED  IS WHAT'S CALLED LOMO, WHICH IS A SPANISH HAM. IT'S ACTUALLY LOIN, AND IT HAS  SPICES ON THE OUTSIDE. IT'S DELICIOUS. SO I THOUGHT,  I'M GONNA DO THAT PLATTER JUST WITH THAT ONE KIND OF MEAT  AND FRESH FIGS, AND THEN EVERYBODY  CAN HELP THEMSELVES, AND CERTAINLY EASIER FOR ME. THAT'LL BE OUR SECRET. YOU WANT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET FIGS  THAT ARE REALLY RIPE, BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY'RE NOT, SO I ALWAYS BUY THEM IN ADVANCE. AND I'M JUST GONNA PUT THEM RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE  OF THE PLATTER. THESE ARE BIG, SO I'M CUTTING THEM IN QUARTERS, BUT IF THEY'RE SMALLER,  YOU CAN JUST CUT THEM IN HALF. OKAY, RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. WELL, THAT LOOKS GREAT, AND IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD  WITH A LITTLE GLASS OF SHERRY. I ACTUALLY GOT  THE SAME MANZANILLA SHERRY THAT THEY SERVED IN LONDON. IT'S SORT OF LIGHT,  AND IT'S DELICIOUS. MMM. I LOVE A GOOD SHERRY. IT'S VERY OLD-FASHIONED,  BUT IT'S REALLY DELICIOUS. THAT'S PERFECT. ALL I NEED TO DO  IS GET THE FOOD ON THE TABLE, AND LUNCH IS READY. THESE LOOK FANTASTIC.  CAN WE START? CAN WE DIG IN?  YEAH, YOU CAN START. YEAH, ARE YOU GONNA--  THEY'RE FIGS  AND SPANISH HAM. OOH.  ACTUALLY, DO THE HAM AND FIGS  TOGETHER. THEY'RE REALLY GOOD. - CHEERS. - CHEERS. INA, WELCOME BACK  FROM LONDON.  HAPPY HOLIDAYS. IT'S DELICIOUS. CHEERS.  IS IT GOOD? IS IT  THE BEST FIG YOU EVER HAD? IT'S THE BEST FIG  I'VE EVER HAD. IT'S SO GOOD  WITH THE SHERRY. OKAY, WHO'S READY  FOR LUNCH? - I AM. - I AM. SO, LAURA, DO YOU WANT TO PASS  THE ROSEMARY ROASTED POTATOES OR SERVE WINE?  ABSOLUTELY. CAN YOU PASS  THE PLOUGHMAN'S LUNCH? I DON'T THINK ANY PLOUGHMAN EVER HAD A LUNCH  LIKE THAT, THOUGH. OH, INA, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL! THANK YOU.  OH, I WANT SOME OF THIS. IT'S ENGLISH... THERE'S A MIDDLE EASTERN SALAD.  OOH. THIS IS  A VERY INTERNATIONAL MEAL.  WOW. MY GOODNESS. ACTUALLY, SOMETIMES  THE PITA'S ALL MIXED IN. SO GREAT TO HAVE A MEAL  THAT'S SO DIFFERENT FROM OUR NORMAL TURKEY. BUT THIS  IS SO FESTIVE. OKAY, WHO'S READY  FOR DESSERT?  I AM. LAURA, ARE YOU IN CHARGE  OF THE PLATES?  YES, I AM. AND, BOBBY, YOU'RE IN CHARGE  OF THE HOLIDAY BUNS? OKAY.  THEY'RE LIKE CHELSEA BUNS. DOES ANYBODY KNOW  WHO CHELSEA IS?  I THINK THAT CHELSEA  IS A BOROUGH OF LONDON. OH.  THAT'LL DO IT. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING  ABOUT LONDON. SO THESE ARE MADE  WITH PECANS-- UH, PEA-CONS, AS THEY SAY-- - PECANS AND DRIED CRANBERRIES. - DELICIOUS! AND THE LOLLIPOPS?  THE LOLLIPOPS ARE MADE WITH CASHEWS AND DRIED CHERRIES.  I'LL TRADE YOU. VERY HOLIDAY-ISH.  YES. MMM! I LOVE THE IDEA  OF A HOLIDAY LUNCH.  YEAH? CAN WE DO IT AGAIN  NEXT YEAR?  I'M UP. I'M GAME. HAPPY HOLIDAYS.  HAPPY HOLIDAYS. JEFFREY'S COME HOME LATE. I THOUGHT I'D MAKE HIM  A LITTLE MIDNIGHT SNACK. I'M GONNA MAKE A BACON SANDWICH.  IT'S VERY ENGLISH. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A B.L.T. BUT WITHOUT THE "L" AND THE "T." SO I'VE GOT TOAST. PUT A LITTLE BUTTER ON IT  SO IT'S NICE AND DELICIOUS. WHEN I AS IN LONDON,  I HAD BACON SANDWICHES, AND I JUST THOUGHT  THEY WERE SO DELICIOUS, SURPRISINGLY, BECAUSE I WOULD  NEVER THINK OF DOING THEM WITHOUT THE LETTUCE AND TOMATO. FOR BACON, I USE  THE APPLEWOOD SMOKED BACON. IT'S REALLY SORT OF THICK-CUT.  IT'S GOOD. AND I ROAST IT ON AN OVEN RACK  IN THE OVEN-- 400 DEGREES FOR ABOUT 25 MINUTES JUST UNTIL IT'S REALLY NICE  AND CRISP. THIS IS SUCH AN EASY WAY  TO COOK BACON, INSTEAD OF HAVING BACON FAT SPLATTERING ALL OVER THE KITCHEN IN A PAN. IT KEEPS IT NICE AND FLAT, AND IT DRAINS ALL THE FAT AWAY,  SO IT KEEPS IT REALLY CRISP. OKAY, PUT ITS LITTLE LID ON. CUT THEM IN HALF. HE'S GONNA LOVE THIS. I MADE YOU  A LITTLE MIDNIGHT SNACK. I THOUGHT  I'D SURPRISE YOU. OH, I LOVE SURPRISES.  I DO KNOW  YOU LOVE SURPRISES, LIKE THE ONE I HAD FOR YOU  IN LONDON. THAT WAS A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.  WASN'T THAT AMAZING? HERE'S THE STORY. REMEMBER BACK IN LONDON  WHEN I WENT TO LUNCH AND JEFFREY HAD A MEETING AND I TOLD HIM  I'D MEET HIM LATER? WELL, I WAS SECRETLY PLANNING  ONE MORE SURPRISE FOR WHEN HE TURNED UP  ON THE BUS. HI, SWEETIE.  HI, BABY. MWAH.  MWAH. SO I'VE GOT ANOTHER SURPRISE  FOR YOU.  YOU DO?! AND IT INVOLVES A FLIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF LONDON.  YOU'RE KIDDING. NO. COME WITH ME.  OKAY. ISN'T THIS INCREDIBLE?  LOOK OVER THERE. OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH,  TOM. THANK YOU.  I LOVE DRINKING CHAMPAGNE  ON THE EYE. NOW I KNOW WHY THEY CALL IT  A FLIGHT ON THE LONDON EYE. IT REALLY FEELS LIKE FLYING,  DOESN'T IT? IT'S FANTASTIC. WONDERFUL. HOW IS THAT FOR A FOOD TOUR  OF LONDON? COULDN'T HAVE BEEN BETTER. HERE'S TO THE BEST YEAR  EVER. I LOVE YOU. MWAH.
