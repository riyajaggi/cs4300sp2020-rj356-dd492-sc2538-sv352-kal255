 LAST-MINUTE GUESTS? NO PROBLEM.  I ACTUALLY PRIDE MYSELF, WITH A FEW THINGS  FROM THE PANTRY AND SOME VEGETABLES  FROM THE FREEZER, I CAN PULL TOGETHER DINNER  IN NO TIME AT ALL. WITH A QUICK RAID OF MY PANTRY  AND THE FREEZER, I'VE GOT A PERFECT  ONE-POT MEAL... WITH ASPARAGUS  AND PEAS FROM THE FREEZER, FOLLOWED BY... AND I'M SERVING IT  WITH SHORTBREAD COOKIES DIPPED IN CHOCOLATE. I GUARANTEE YOU'LL HAVE ALL  THE INGREDIENTS IN YOUR PANTRY.

 THIS IS BACK TO BASICS  ON LAST-MINUTE DINNER GUESTS, AND I'M COOKING WITH  WHATEVER I HAVE ON HAND. MY FRIEND MIGUEL CALLED EARLIER.  HE SAID HE'S IN TOWN RESEARCHING HISTORIC HOUSES  FOR A PHOTO SHOOT, AND, OF COURSE,  I HAD TO INVITE HIM FOR DINNER. SO I THOUGHT, I'M GONNA  CHALLENGE MYSELF, SEE IF I CAN MAKE HIM DINNER FROM THINGS I ALREADY HAVE  IN THE HOUSE. THE RISOTTO HAS  TO BE MADE BEFORE DINNER, BUT I'M GONNA START  WITH DESSERT, OF COURSE, CARAMEL PECAN SUNDAES  AND SHORTBREAD. I'VE ALREADY GOT  THE SHORTBREAD DOUGH CHILLED. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I MADE IT. THIS IS A REALLY  EASY DOUGH TO MAKE.

 I MAKE IT IN AN ELECTRIC MIXER FITTED WITH A PADDLE ATTACHMENT. FIRST I PUT IN 3/4 OF A POUND  OF ROOM-TEMPERATURE BUTTER... THEN I ADD 1 CUP OF SUGAR... AND A TEASPOON OF GOOD VANILLA. ADD 3 1/2 CUPS  OF ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR... AND FINALLY, 1/4 OF A TEASPOON  OF KOSHER SALT. TURN THE MIXER ON LOW AND JUST MIX THE INGREDIENTS  TILL THEY JUST COME TOGETHER. TURN THE DOUGH OUT  ONTO A FLOURED BOARD AND SHAPE IT UNTIL IT COMES  INTO A FLAT DISK. WRAP THE DISK IN PLASTIC WRAP AND CHILL IN THE REFRIGERATOR  FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. SO THIS IS THE SHORTBREAD DOUGH. IT'S BEEN CHILLED, AND NOW I'M GONNA ROLL IT OUT  AND MAKE COOKIES. THIS IS A REALLY GREAT DOUGH, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE  IT'S SO FLEXIBLE. I CAN MAKE ALL DIFFERENT KINDS  OF STAR SHAPES AND... THIS TIME, I THINK  I'M GONNA CUT IT IN HALF. IT'S A LOT OF COOKIES  FOR JUST MIGUEL AND ME. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,  I CAN FREEZE THE OTHER HALF FOR THE NEXT TIME HE SHOWS UP. AND ACTUALLY, I EVEN FLOUR  THE ROLLING PIN. THERE'S NO POINT  IN MAKING COOKIES IF THEY'RE GONNA STICK  TO THE BOARD. SO I'M JUST GONNA ROLL THIS OUT,  ABOUT 1/2 AN INCH THICK. YOU DON'T WANT  THE DOUGH TOO COLD, 'CAUSE IF IT DOES,  IT STARTS TO CRACK. IT'S REALLY HARD TO DEAL WITH. IF IT GETS TOO THIN,  YOU CAN PUSH IT BACK TOGETHER. JUST KEEP MOVING IT AROUND UNTIL YOU GET  THE RIGHT THICKNESS. I MAKE ALL KINDS OF COOKIES  FROM THIS SHORTBREAD DOUGH-- IT'S JUST WONDERFUL--  LIKE LINZER COOKIES AND PECAN SHORTBREAD  BY PUTTING PECANS IN. BUT THIS TIME I'M GONNA MAKE  LITTLE FINGER-SHAPED COOKIES. I'M GONNA DIP 'EM IN CHOCOLATE. IT'S GONNA BE GREAT  WITH THE SUNDAES. SO I NEED THIS ABOUT  1/2 AN INCH THICK. I ACTUALLY USE MY FINGER  TO SEE HOW THICK IT IS. THAT'S PERFECT. OKAY, READY FOR THE CUTTER. SO THIS IS THE SORT OF FINGER  SHAPE THAT I WANT TO MAKE. JUST CUT EACH COOKIE. SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO  COME OUT OF THE CUTTER, BUT YOU JUST TAP THE EDGE  ON THE BOARD AND IT'LL JUST COME RIGHT OUT. SO I'M USING HALF-SHEET PAN,  PARCHMENT PAPER. KEEPS THE PAN CLEAN,  THE COOKIES BAKE BETTER. I LOVE PARCHMENT PAPER. THESE ARE GONNA BE  DELICIOUS COOKIES. SO I CAN GET BETWEEN  10 AND 16 COOKIES OUT OF THIS, DEPENDING ON IF I REROLL  THE SCRAPS, BUT I THINK I'LL JUST FREEZE  THE SCRAPS FOR LATER. MY FRIEND MIGUEL'S IN TOWN.  I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM. HE'S HERE PHOTOGRAPHING HISTORIC HOUSES IN EAST HAMPTON. I SET HIM UP  WITH RICHARD BARONS, THE WONDERFUL DIRECTOR OF  THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY. HI, HOW ARE YOU?  NICE TO SEE YOU. HI. HOW ARE YOU DOING? NICE TO SEE YOU. WHY DON'T YOU COME IN? JUST A LITTLE BIT  OF SUGAR ON THE TOP. JUST GIVES THEM  A LITTLE BIT OF SPARKLE WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE OVEN. THE OSBORN JACKSON HOUSE  IS NAMED FOR THE FIRST FAMILY AND THE LAST FAMILY  WHO LIVED HERE. THE OSBORNS WERE HERE  FOR SIX GENERATION. NOW I'M GONNA BAKE THEM, 350 DEGREES  FOR 20 TO 25 MINUTES UNTIL THEY JUST START  TO BROWN ON THE EDGES. THE EARLIEST PORTION  OF THE HOUSE WAS BUILT AROUND 1740. THE ROOM THAT  WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW IS IN THE COLONIAL STYLE. I LOVE THE WAY SHORTBREAD SMELLS  IN THE OVEN. HERE WE ARE  IN THE KITCHEN WITH AN ARRAY OF ANCIENT TOOLS. I THINK INA WOULD FIND THEM  VERY, VERY INTERESTING. SHORTBREAD COOKIES DIPPED  IN CHOCOLATE, NOW WHO WOULD HAVE  A PROBLEM WITH THAT? SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS  I'M GONNA SHAVE SOME CHOCOLATE. I'M USING SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE, JUST ENOUGH FOR TEN COOKIES. IF I DO IT IN CHUNKS,  IT'S NOT GONNA MELT RIGHT. SO IT'S IMPORTANT  TO JUST TAKE YOUR KNIFE AND JUST SHAVE IT OFF. I CAN MAKE GANACHE, WHICH IS  CHOCOLATE AND CREAM TOGETHER, BUT IT'LL NEVER REALLY HARDEN, AND I LOVE WHEN IT'S SORT OF  A HARD CHOCOLATE COATING. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS  IS YOU HAVE TO TEMPER IT, AND I HATE THAT WHOLE THING  WITH THE THERMOMETERS, SO I HAVE A REALLY  QUICK METHOD FOR TEMPERING. OKAY. FIRST, I'M GONNA PUT HALF  THE CHOCOLATE IN A BOWL AND MICROWAVE IT. 30 SECONDS. THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF TEMPERING IS TO MAKE SURE  THE CHOCOLATE STAYS SHINY, WHICH YOU CERTAINLY  WANT IT TO DO. AND USUALLY IT INVOLVES  THERMOMETERS-- IT'S A WHOLE PROCESS. THIS IS LIKE TEMPERING  FOR IDIOTS, LIKE ME. SO I'M JUST GONNA MELT IT  FOR 30 SECONDS, GIVE IT A STIR. IT'S ALL ABOUT KEEPING  THE TEMPERATURE LOW. AND YOU WANT TO  JUST BARELY MELT IT. SO JUST GIVE IT A STIR. IT'S NOT QUITE MELTED SO I'M  GONNA DO ANOTHER 30 SECONDS. AND JUST KEEP DOING THAT UNTIL  THE CHOCOLATE'S JUST MELTED. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD  THE REST OF THE CHOCOLATE. I ACTUALLY USE THE METHOD  FOR CHOCOLATE BARK, WHITE CHOCOLATE  AND DARK CHOCOLATE, AND I USE IT  FOR DIPPING STRAWBERRIES. ANYTIME YOU USE CHOCOLATE  FOR A GARNISH, THIS IS PERFECT. NOW LET'S SEE HOW IT'S DOING. SO THE FIRST BIT  OF CHOCOLATE'S MELTED, AND NOW WHAT I WANT TO DO  IS ADD THE REST OF IT AND JUST MELT IT RIGHT IN,  AND WHAT THIS DOES IS KEEP THE TEMPERATURE  FROM GETTING TOO HOT. WHEN CHOCOLATE'S MELTED  AND NOT TEMPERED, IT GETS THAT SORT OF BLOOM  WHERE IT'S SORT OF GRAY-- NOT VERY PRETTY.  YOU WANT REALLY GLOSSY, DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE. SO THAT'S JUST  GONNA MELT RIGHT IN. OKAY, TIME TO DIP THE COOKIES. SO THE COOKIES  ARE BAKED AND COOLED. I'M JUST GONNA DRIZZLE CHOCOLATE  ACROSS THE TOP OF EACH ONE. JUST HALF--I LIKE THE WAY IT  LOOKS WHEN IT'S BOTH. NOW HOW GOOD DOES THAT LOOK? THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD. I LIKE WHEN IT'S ROUGH-LOOKING.  IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT, LIKE IT JUST CAME OUT OF  A BOX OF COOKIES. I WANT IT TO LOOK VERY HOMEMADE. MMM. AFTER A NICE DINNER  OF RISOTTO PRIMAVERA, I WOULD SAY  CARAMEL PECAN SUNDAES AND SHORTBREAD DIPPED  IN CHOCOLATE, I THINK MIGUEL  WILL BE VERY HAPPY. THINK THEY'LL MISS JUST ONE? OHH, THESE LOOK TOO GOOD. NOTHING LIKE BEING COVERED IN CHOCOLATE. IT'S SO DELICIOUS. MY FRIEND MIGUEL IS IN TOWN. HE'S PHOTOGRAPHING  HISTORIC HOUSES. I'VE INVITED HIM FOR DINNER,  AND I JUST DECIDED I'M GONNA MAKE HIM DINNER FROM THINGS  I ALREADY HAVE IN THE HOUSE. I'M GONNA MAKE RISOTTO  JUST BEFORE DINNER, BUT FIRST, I'M GONNA MAKE  CARAMEL PECAN SUNDAES. FIRST, THE CARAMEL.  1/3 OF A CUP OF WATER, 1 1/2 CUPS OF SUGAR. AND WHO DOESN'T LIKE  CARAMEL SAUCE? JUST TURN IT ON LOW HEAT  UNTIL THE SUGAR DISSOLVES. IN THE MEANTIME,  I'VE GOT SOME PECANS WHICH ARE PERFECTLY FINE  THE WAY THEY ARE, BUT THEY'RE SO MUCH BETTER  WHEN THEY'RE TOASTED. SO I'M JUST GONNA  PUT SOME IN A DRY PAN... JUST TURN ON THE HEAT AND JUST TOAST THEM  FOR A FEW MINUTES. AND REALLY, YOU CAN SMELL THEM.  YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE. THAT WILL BE GREAT WHEN I MAKE  THE CARAMEL PECAN SUNDAES-- ICE CREAM, CARAMEL SAUCE,  TOASTED PECANS. HOW BAD CAN THAT BE? OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA  PUT THEM ASIDE IN A DISH. MMM, LOVE THE SMELL  WHEN THEY'RE WARM. OKAY, SO I'VE GOT MELTED SUGAR. I'M JUST GONNA TURN  THE HEAT WAY UP, LET IT BOIL AWAY. I WANT IT TO BE 350 DEGREES  ON THE CANDY THERMOMETER. IT'S GONNA TAKE PROBABLY  FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES, BUT YOU REALLY WANT  TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT. AND DON'T STIR IT,  JUST SWIRL IT. OTHERWISE, YOU CAN END UP  WITH A SOLID MESS. OKAY, WHILE THAT BOILS, I NEED 1 1/4 CUPS  OF HEAVY CREAM. YOU CAN ALWAYS GET  CARAMEL SAUCE IN A JAR, BUT IT'S SO MUCH BETTER  WHEN YOU MAKE IT YOURSELF, AND IT LASTS FOREVER. OKAY, THE CARAMEL--ACTUALLY,  YOU CAN REALLY SMELL IT. IT'S JUST STARTING  TO CHANGE COLOR. JUST GET IT  SO IT'S A REALLY WARM SORT OF CHESTNUT COLOR. PERFECT-- THE RIGHT COLOR,  IT'S 350 DEGREES. I'M JUST GONNA POUR  THE CREAM IN. THIS IS CRITICAL TIME. JUST STAND BACK, 'CAUSE  IT'S GONNA BUBBLE UP VIOLENTLY. FANTASTIC. THAT'S THE CREAM AND THE VANILLA. AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN  IS THERE'S GONNA BE SORT OF A MASS  IN THE BOTTOM OF IT, BUT IF YOU JUST LET IT  SETTLE DOWN IT WILL ALL COME INTO A NICE, SMOOTH CARAMEL SAUCE. MMM, THIS LOOKS GORGEOUS. AND JUST TURN IT  ON VERY LOW HEAT UNTIL IT ALL BECOMES  A REALLY NICE, SMOOTH SAUCE. THE NEXT PLACE  I SET MIGUEL UP WITH IS ONE OF THE OLDEST  PRIVATE HOUSES IN EAST HAMPTON. IT'S SO LOVELY.  I HOPE HE LIKES IT. OH, WOW, THIS IS  REALLY GREAT. ISN'T IT? AS YOU CAN SEE, THE HOUSE HAS A LOT OF PRE-REVOLUTIONARY WAR CHARM. THAT'S THE ORIGINAL FIREPLACE  WHICH WAS USED FOR COOKING.  UH-HUH. THERE'S A BEEHIVE OVEN...  OH, YEAH,  I SEE IT. YEAH. AND NOW THE PANTRY RIGHT OVER THERE.  THAT'S GREAT. I LOVE THE WALLS.  I LOVE THE COLOR. YEAH, IT'S STRIPPED DOWN TO  THE ORIGINAL GREEN MILK PAINT. REALLY, REALLY,  REALLY NICE. HERE IS WHERE THE CURRENT OWNERS STRIPPED DOWN TO THE ORIGINAL WALLPAPER.  OH, IT'S WONDERFUL. ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?  YEAH,  REALLY INTERESTING. WELL, YOU CAN'T HAVE ICE CREAM  SUNDAES WITHOUT ICE CREAM. EVERYBODY'S GOT SOME KIND OF  ICE CREAM IN THE FREEZER. SO I'VE GOT VANILLA  AND BUTTER PECAN. THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA DO-- WHAT I LOVE TO DO IS SCOOP  THE ICE CREAM IN ADVANCE AND PUT IT IN A LITTLE GLASS AND THEN FREEZE THE WHOLE THING. AND THEN THE GLASS GETS  REALLY FROSTY, AND THEN I CAN POUR THE CARAMEL AND PECANS ON AFTERWARDS,  AND THE COOKIES. SO ONE SCOOP OF EACH. IT'S REALLY EASY TO TAKE  STORE-BOUGHT ICE CREAM AND DRESS IT UP FOR COMPANY.  HERE'S SOME OTHER WAYS I DO IT. HOMEMADE RASPBERRY SAUCE  IS REALLY ELEGANT, AND IT'S SO EASY TO MAKE. HEAT UP 1/2 A PINT OF RASPBERRIES AND 1/2 A CUP SUGAR, AND PUT THEM IN A FOOD PROCESSOR WITH A CUP OF  SEEDLESS RASPBERRY JAM AND A SPLASH OF FRAMBOISE, AND YOU'VE GOT A FABULOUS TRIPLE  RASPBERRY SAUCE. AND HERE'S ANOTHER IDEA  THAT'S REALLY DELICIOUS AND SO FAST. AFFOGATO IS A GREAT  ITALIAN DESSERT. IT JUST TAKES A FEW STEPS  AND YOU'RE READY. FIRST, BREW SOME  ESPRESSO COFFEE. THEN SCOOP SOME VANILLA ICE  CREAM INTO A PRETTY BOWL. POUR OVER THE ESPRESSO, AND GARNISH IT WITH SOME CHOCOLATE-COVERED  ESPRESSO BEANS. YOU'VE GOT DESSERT, AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SERVE COFFEE. SO THAT'S TWO GOOD  ICE CREAM DESSERTS, BUT THESE ARE DESTINED  FOR CARAMEL AND PECANS. I'M JUST GONNA STORE THEM  IN THE FREEZER, AND THE GLASS WILL GET  NICE AND FROSTED, AND WE CAN HAVE THEM  FOR DESSERT ANYTIME. NEXT, I'M GONNA MAKE RISOTTO.  THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT RISOTTO IS THAT IT'S A BASIC RECIPE  YOU CAN ADD ALMOST ANYTHING TO. AND I'VE GOT SOME VEGETABLES  IN THE FREEZER THAT ARE GONNA BE PERFECT. ONE THING I REALLY BELIEVE  IS COOKING'S HARD. IT'S NOT SO EASY,  AND ONE OF THE THINGS I DO TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MYSELF IS I HAVE A FEW  REALLY BASIC RECIPES. I CAN CHANGE THE INGREDIENTS AND HAVE COMPLETELY  DIFFERENT DISHES, AND RISOTTO IS  ONE OF THOSE DISHES. I MEAN, IF I HAVE LEEKS  AND FENNEL IN THE FRIDGE AND ASPARAGUS, I CAN MAKE  ONE KIND OF RISOTTO. IF I HAVE BUTTERNUT SQUASH  IN THE FRIDGE, I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENT ONE. BUT ONCE I'VE GOT  THE BASIC PROCESS MASTERED, I FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE  MAKING ANY KIND OF RISOTTO. SO I'M GONNA START  WITH LEEKS AND FENNEL. I'VE GOT FENNEL ALL CHOPPED UP, AND THE LEEKS  I'M JUST GONNA WASH. I'M GONNA MAKE  RISOTTO PRIMAVERA WITH ALL KINDS OF  SPRING VEGETABLES. I'M JUST GONNA HEAT UP  SOME OIL AND BUTTER, ABOUT 1 1/2 TABLESPOON OF EACH. OKAY, LET THAT GET HOT. I'M GONNA CHOP UP THE LEEKS. I LOVE LEEKS. I THINK THEY HAVE  A REALLY DELICATE ONION FLAVOR, AND THEY'RE FANTASTIC  IN RISOTTO. SO RIGHT INTO THE PAN-- 3 CUPS OF LEEKS AND ABOUT A CUP OF FENNEL. SO JUST SAUTé THE FENNEL  AND LEEKS UNTIL THEY'RE TENDER AND JUST BEFORE  THEY START TO BROWN. IT SHOULD TAKE ABOUT  FIVE TO SEVEN MINUTES. ANOTHER THING THAT I KEEP  IN THE FREEZER ALL THE TIME-- I HAVE TO SAY  IT'S MY ONE WEAKNESS-- IS HOMEMADE CHICKEN STOCK. I THINK IT MAKES ALL  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT,  USE CANNED CHICKEN STOCK, BUT IT REALLY MAKES  A DIFFERENCE. I JUST THINK IT ADDS GREAT DEPTH OF FLAVOR TO THINGS, TO SOUPS, STEWS. I'M GONNA HEAT UP ABOUT 6 CUPS. SO THE FIRST THING I NEED  IS ARBORIO RICE. THIS IS A SPECIAL  KIND OF ITALIAN RICE THAT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT  OF STARCH IN IT. SO I NEED 1 1/2 CUPS. I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT RIGHT  INTO THE VEGETABLES. AND IT'S IMPORTANT  TO COOK IT FOR A MINUTE. YOU WANT TO COAT EACH GRAIN  WITH BUTTER AND OIL. JUST MAKE SURE  IT'S REALLY WELL-COATED, BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE RISOTTO  WILL GET ALL STICKY. YOU DON'T WANT STICKY RISOTTO. AND I'M GONNA ADD  LOTS OF DRY WHITE WINE-- ABOUT 2/3 OF A CUP  OF WHITE WINE. FANTASTIC. JUST LET THE WINE GET ABSORBED.  IT'LL JUST TAKE A MINUTE. SO THE CHICKEN STOCK  IS SIMMERING AWAY. I'M JUST GONNA ADD JUST ENOUGH,  ABOUT TWO LADLEFULS, AND COOK THE RISOTTO UNTIL  IT'S JUST ABOUT ABSORBED... AND THEN ADD MORE CHICKEN STOCK. THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS GONNA TAKE  ABOUT 20 MINUTES. ACTUALLY I FIND MAKING RISOTTO  KINDA THERAPEUTIC. AT THE END OF A LONG DAY, ALL I HAVE TO DO  IS STAND HERE AND STIR. IT JUST GETS A LITTLE BIT DRY, AND THEN YOU PUT TWO MORE  LADLES OF STOCK IN AND JUST LET IT SIMMER AWAY. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MIGUEL. HE'S COME TO PHOTOGRAPH HISTORIC HOUSES OF EAST HAMPTON, AND IT'S BEEN A WHILE, SO I HAVE TO CATCH UP WITH HIS ADVENTURES. NOW HERE'S A REAL GREAT FIND. IN THE MASTER BEDROOM THEY UNCOVERED A FIREPLACE THAT WAS HIDDEN BEHIND  THE PLASTER. I LOVE IT. THIS HOUSE  IS REALLY GONNA MAKE A GREAT, GREAT LOCATION  FOR THE PHOTO SHOOT. AND NOW FOR THE VEGETABLES. I HAVE TO ADMIT,  I DON'T LOVE FROZEN VEGETABLES. THEY'RE A FEW THAT  ARE ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD, AND ASPARAGUS AND PEAS  ARE TWO OF THEM. SO I'VE GOT A POUND OF ASPARAGUS  AND 10 OUNCES OF PEAS. GOOD NEW ABOUT  FROZEN VEGETABLES... IS THEY'VE ALREADY  BEEN BLANCHED. WHEN I PUT FRESH VEGETABLES  INTO RISOTTO, I LIKE TO BLANCH THEM FIRST,  BUT, WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT  WITH FROZEN VEGETABLE. I'M JUST GONNA CUT THEM IN HALF, AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA TOSS 'EM  RIGHT INTO THE RISOTTO AND LET THE HEAT OF THE RISOTTO  DEFROST THEM AND COOK THEM. AND 10 OUNCES OF FROZEN PEAS. YOU DON'T WANT  THOSE TINY LITTLE PEAS. YOU WANT THE BIGGER PEAS. RIGHT IN,  AND JUST GIVE IT A STIR. I MEAN, THIS IS A REALLY  GOOD DINNER, ISN'T IT? RICE AND VEGETABLES. NEEDS A LITTLE MORE  CHICKEN STOCK. SO IN THE SAME WAY THAT I LIKE SORT OF AN ACIDITY  TO SOME THINGS, I THINK LEMON ZEST WOULD REALLY  BRING OUT THE FLAVORS OF THIS. SO I'M JUST GONNA TAKE  THE ZEST OF A LEMON, ABOUT A TABLESPOON  OF FRESH LEMON ZEST, AND JUST PUT IT RIGHT IN. SALT AND PEPPER, ABOUT 2 TEASPOONS OF SALT-- IT REALLY NEEDS QUITE A BIT 'CAUSE IT'S  A BIG POT OF RISOTTO-- ABOUT 1 TEASPOON OF PEPPER. AND THEN JUST BEFORE DINNER,  I'M GONNA FINISH IT OFF. JUST A FEW MORE THINGS TO ADD TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY THE MOST  FABULOUS RISOTTO PRIMAVERA. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE MIGUEL.  THIS IS GONNA BE REALLY FUN. MY FRIEND MIGUEL FLORES-VIANNA  IS COMING FOR DINNER, AND I'M MAKING A BIG POT  OF RISOTTO PRIMAVERA. I JUST THINK IT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT YOU CAN PULL TOGETHER FROM INGREDIENTS I HAVE IN  THE HOUSE, NO GROCERY SHOPPING. BUT ALSO, HE'S BEEN SCHLEPPING  AROUND HISTORIC SITES ALL DAY. IT'S GONNA BE NICE TO HAVE  SOMETHING WARM IN HIS TUMMY. SO I'M JUST GONNA FINISH  THE RISOTTO WITH A FEW MORE INGREDIENTS  TO MAKE IT FANTASTIC-- A LITTLE RICHNESS  WITH MASCARPONE, ABOUT 1/3 OF A CUP... SOME FRESH LEMON JUICE, JUST A BIG SQUEEZE,  COUPLE OF TABLESPOONS, AND, OF COURSE,  PARMESAN CHEESE-- YOU CAN'T HAVE RISOTTO  WITHOUT PARMESAN-- ABOUT 1/4 OF A CUP  OF PARMESAN CHEESE. I ALREADY HAVE IT GRATED. I GRATED IT IN  THE FOOD PROCESSOR. JUST STIR IT ALL IN, AND VOILà, DINNER'S READY. MMM, THIS LOOKS FANTASTIC. I'M JUST GONNA TASTE IT, JUST  TO MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY GREAT. JUST A LITTLE. THAT'S GOOD RISOTTO. I CAN REALLY TASTE  THE VEGETABLES, AND THE LEMON REALLY GIVES IT  A WONDERFUL FLAVOR, PARMESAN, A LITTLE BIT  OF MASCARPONE. SO THAT'S DINNER READY. JUST A FEW MORE THINGS  TO DO BEFORE MIGUEL GETS HERE. LET ME JUST TALK YOU THROUGH IT. FOR THE RISOTTO, I'LL JUST HEAP A GENEROUS  SERVING INTO TWO BOWLS... THEN TOP EACH ONE  WITH MORE PARMESAN AND A SPRINKLING OF CHIVES. IT'S GONNA LOOK FABULOUS,  AND IT'S GONNA TASTE DELICIOUS. I REALLY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY  ABOUT UNEXPECTED GUESTS WHEN I HAVE SIMPLE RECIPES  LIKE THIS ONE UP MY SLEEVE. AND BELIEVE ME,  DESSERT IS JUST AS EASY. AFTER DINNER, I'M JUST GONNA POUR THAT GORGEOUS CARAMEL SAUCE OVER THE SCOOPS OF VANILLA  AND PECAN ICE CREAM. THEN SPRINKLE OVER  THE TOASTED PECANS, AND THE SUNDAES WILL BE READY. THEY'LL BE DELICIOUS WITH A TRAY OF SHORTBREADS  DIPPED IN CHOCOLATE. DINNER JUST DOESN'T GET ANY SIMPLER OR BETTER THAN THIS. MIGUEL'S HERE.  I'M COOL. I'M CALM. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING  UNDER CONTROL. MIGUEL. SO NICE TO SEE YOU. I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU.  COME ON IN. IT'S SO KIND OF YOU TO INVITE ME  ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. WELL, I CAN DEFINITELY WHIP  SOMETHING UP FOR DINNER. THANK YOU.  I'M SURE  I CAN DO IT. Closed Captions provided by  Scripps Networks, LLC. Captioned by Closed Captioning  Services, Inc.
