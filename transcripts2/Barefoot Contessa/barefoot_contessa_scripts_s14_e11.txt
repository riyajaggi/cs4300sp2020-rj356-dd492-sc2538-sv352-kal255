 SHRIMP WITH RUSSIAN DRESSING AND SPICY SALAMI  WITH COOL CUCUMBER. THEN ON TO DRINKS --  HOW I SET UP A COCKTAIL BAR, AND A GREAT, NEW COCKTAIL IDEA FROM MY FRIEND GLENN AT RED BAR. IT'S ONE OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS IN THE HAMPTONS. DON'T TELL INA  I'M MIXING AN INA-TINI. AND WHETHER IT'S A COCKTAIL PARTY FOR THE HOLIDAYS OR FOR ANYTIME, I'M READY TO ANSWER  ALL YOUR COCKTAIL QUESTIONS  IN "ASK INA." SO MANY PEOPLE  HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH ASKING FOR HELP  WITH COCKTAIL PARTIES. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN GETTING. HI INA.  HI. HOW DO YOU CHOOSE A SELECTION OF HORS D'OEUVRES THAT SUITS A VARIETY OF TASTES? SO JULIA WANTS TO KNOW  WHAT TO SERVE, 
  subslikescript square adaptive  
 
 BUT ALSO HOW MANY OF  EACH THING TO SERVE. IT'S SOMETHING  EVERYBODY WANTS ADVICE ON. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY, EVERYBODY SEEMS TO WANT  EASY IDEAS. PEOPLE WANT TO  TURN UP THE VOLUME. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE  OUR GUESTS SAY "WOW"  AT OUR NEXT COCKTAIL PARTY? CHEERS. I'M GONNA SHOW YOU HOW TO DO  A STRESS FREE AND FUN-FILLED  COCKTAIL PARTY. LET'S GET STARTED. WELL YOU CAN'T HAVE  A COCKTAIL PARTY  WITHOUT THE FOOD AND THIS IS MY FORMULA  FOR AN EASY COCKTAIL PARTY. I SERVE SIX HORS D'OEUVRES,  BUT I ONLY MAKE TWO OF THEM AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE. IT'S TURKEY TEA SANDWICHES. THE FIRST THING I'M DOING IS TAKING A RAISIN AND NUT BREAD AND SLICING IT PRETTY THIN. I'M GONNA GET MAYBE  ABOUT 20 SLICES OUT OF IT. NEXT THING'S CREAM CHEESE,  I NEED 12 OUNCES OF  CREAM CHEESE. IF YOUR CREAM CHEESE  ISN'T ROOM TEMPERATURE IT'S GOING TO BE  VERY HARD TO SPREAD AND THE SANDWICHES  WON'T STICK TOGETHER,  WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU DON'T WANT  A MESS ON THE PLATE, YOU WANT BEAUTIFUL  TEA SANDWICHES. OKAY, THAT'S 12 OUNCES OF  CREAM CHEESE. JUST GIVE IT  A LITTLE BIT OF A STIR. I NEED 1/2 CUP  OF CHOPPED SCALLIONS,  THAT'S ABOUT FOUR SCALLIONS. JUST RIGHT INTO  THE CREAM CHEESE. A LITTLE SALT AND PEPPER  TO GIVE IT MORE FLAVOR. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT  NOT TO WHIP IT, YOU JUST WANT IT TO BE REALLY SMOOTH, BUT NOT WHIPPED. SO I'M GONNA TAKE THE BREAD  AND LAY THEM OUT. I TEND TO DO THINGS  ASSEMBLY LINE. JUST LAY THEM RIGHT OUT  LIKE THAT. THE IMPORTANT THING'S  TO PUT THE CREAM CHEESE  ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BREAD SO WHEN YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER,  THEY STICK TOGETHER. AND JUST SPREAD CREAM CHEESE  ON ALL THE PIECES OF BREAD, JUST A THIN LAYER. DON'T NEGLECT THE CORNERS. AND PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME  ABOUT COCKTAIL PARTIES -- HOW MANY THINGS TO SERVE,  WHAT TO SERVE, AND THIS IS THE WAY  I THINK ABOUT IT. I THINK ABOUT A COCKTAIL PARTY  THE WAY I THINK ABOUT  A DINNER PARTY. YOU WANT A BALANCE OF FLAVORS  AND FOODS SO I'LL MAKE ONE HORS D'OEUVRE  THAT'S VEGETARIAN, SOMETHING THAT HAS MEAT IN IT,  LIKE THIS HAS TURKEY IN IT. I DO SOMETHING THAT'S SEAFOOD. YOU REALLY WANT IT TO HAVE  A NICE BALANCE THE WAY A MEAL HAS A BALANCE. AND FOR THE QUANTITIES,  THREE OR FOUR PIECES  PER PERSON AND YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE ENOUGH. NEXT IS THE TURKEY. SO WHAT I'VE GOT  IS SMOKED TURKEY. SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO  IS COVER EACH SANDWICH WITH ONE LAYER OF  SMOKED TURKEY. AND YOU ONLY WANT TO PUT IT ON  HALF THE SANDWICHES BECAUSE, OR COURSE,  THE OTHER ONES ARE  GONNA BE THE TOPS. OKAY, NEXT IS THE BASIL. I'M JUST PUTTING ONE LEAF  ON EACH SANDWICH. BASIL'S REALLY GREAT  BECAUSE IT'S REALLY PEPPERY, WHICH GIVES GREAT FLAVOR  TO THIS. THEN THE TOPS GO ON. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE  THEY LINE UP. AND PRESS THEM A LITTLE  SO THEY STICK. OKAY, ONTO A BAKING SHEET  LINED WITH PARCHMENT PAPER. SO I'M GONNA REFRIGERATE THESE  UNTIL THE CREAM CHEESE  IS REALLY COLD AND THEN IT STAYS TOGETHER  VERY WELL. OKAY, AND THIS IS THE TRICK  FOR KEEPING THEM REALLY MOIST. DAMP PAPER TOWELS. JUST TAKE TWO PAPER TOWELS, YOU WANT THEM  JUST SLIGHTLY DAMP -- ONLY SLIGHTLY, JUST DAMPEN IT  AND THEN SQUEEZE IT OUT. AND HOPEFULLY  THEY STAY TOGETHER. I'M GONNA STORE THIS  JUST LIKE THIS IN THE REFRIGERATOR  FOR ABOUT AN HOUR 'TIL THEY GET NICE AND FIRM. IF I'M GONNA STORE THEM  FOR LONGER THAN THAT I'LL WRAP THE WHOLE THING  IN PLASTIC WRAP AND THEY'LL STAY JUST DELICIOUS FOR LIKE, SIX HOURS. SO GET THESE NICE AND COLD AND THEN CUT THEM  JUST BEFORE THE PARTY. WHEN THE SANDWICHES ARE COLD  PUT THEM ON A BOARD, CUT THE CRUSTS OFF  WITH A VERY SHARP KNIFE. THEN CUT EACH SANDWICH IN HALF. I DO IT DIAGONALLY,  I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT. PUT THE LITTLE  TRIANGULAR SANDWICHES  ONTO A SQUARE PLATTER WITH THE POINTS UP. I ARRANGE THEM IN TWO ROWS. THEN BECAUSE  I LIKE TO GARNISH IT WITH SOMETHING  THAT'S IN THE SANDWICH I PUT A BUNCH OF BASIL  ON THE PLATTER. SO THAT'S ONE DOWN,  FIVE TO GO. YOU KNOW,  I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME, BUT YOUR FRIENDS DON'T HAVE MORE FUN IF YOU MAKE EVERYTHING YOURSELF. SO INSTEAD OF COOKING  I'M GONNA ASSEMBLE  TWO APPETIZERS AND THE FIRST ONE  IS ENDIVE LEAVES  WITH CREAMY GORGONZOLA. IT'S DELICIOUS. FIRST PEEL THE ENDIVE LEAVES  CAREFULLY OFF THE STALK. PUT SOME LEAVES OF PARSLEY  ON EACH ENDIVE LEAF. IT'S THE PERFECT BACKDROP  FOR THE GORGONZOLA. AND PLACE ABOUT A TABLESPOON  OF REALLY GOOD GORGONZOLA ONTO THE BASE  OF THE ENDIVE LEAF. YOU'LL BE SURPRISED  WHAT A GREAT TASTE COMBINATION  IT IS. NOW THAT WAS PRETTY EASY. SO MY SECOND  ASSEMBLED HORS D'OEUVRES IS SMOKED SALMON ON BLINIS  WITH A LITTLE CREME FRAICHE. AND MY SECRET IS  I BOUGHT THE BLINIS  AT THE STORE. ALL I HAVE TO DO  IS HEAT THEM UP FOR A SECOND. WARM THE BLINIS IN THE OVEN  AT 350 DEGREES JUST FOR  ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. THEN LET THEM  COOL DOWN A LITTLE. YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO HEAT UP  THE SMOKED SALMON. AND TOP EACH ONE  WITH A LITTLE PIECE  OF SMOKED SALMON. I LIKE NORWEGIAN SALMON. IT'S A LITTLE DRIER  AND NOT QUITE AS SALTY  AS OTHER SALMON. THEN A GENEROUS DOLLOP  OF CREME FRAICHE AND GARNISH EACH ONE  WITH A LITTLE SPRIG OF DILL. THAT'S BLINIS  WITH CREME FRAICHE  AND SMOKED SALMON. SO THAT'S  THREE HORS D'OEUVRES DOWN, THREE TO GO, AND HEY,  I HAVEN'T EVEN BROKEN A SWEAT. NEXT UP,  MORE EASY HORS D'OEUVRES. PARMESAN THYME CRACKERS, SHRIMP WITH RUSSIAN DRESSING, AND SALAMI WITH CUCUMBERS. THEN IT'S SETTING UP  A COCKTAIL BAR SHAKING UP A SURPRISE COCKTAIL, AND "ASK INA" ON --  YOU GUESSED IT, COCKTAILS. THROWING A COCKTAIL PARTY  DOES SEEM DAUNTING, BUT THIS IS MY SECRET. I ONLY MAKE TWO APPETIZERS  AND I ASSEMBLE THE REST. AND THEN I DON'T HAVE TO SPEND  A WEEK GETTING READY FOR IT. SO I'VE MADE  ONE OTHER APPETIZER AND NOW I'M MAKING  PARMESAN THYME CRACKERS. THEY SOUND COMPLICATED  'CAUSE WHO MAKES CRACKERS, BUT THEY'RE SO EASY  AND DELICIOUS. I'M GONNA START  WITH 1/4 POUND OF BUTTER. IT HAS TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE,  IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT  ON LOW SPEED TO MIX IT UP. AND THEN THE NEXT THING  IS PARMESAN. SO A CHUNK OF PARMESAN -- I NEED FOUR OUNCES,  ABOUT ONE CUP OF  GRATED PARMESAN. I USE REALLY GOOD  REGGIANO CHEESE. IT'S GOT THAT SORT OF PEPPERY,  WONDERFUL EDGY FLAVOR. I DO THE GRATING  IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR. I'LL SHOW YOU. THIS IS NO-STRESS PARMESAN. NOISY, BUT NO STRESS. YOU WANT TO BE SURE  IT'S VERY FINELY GROUND SO YOU DON'T HAVE BIG PIECES  OF PARMESAN IN THE CRACKERS. SO THAT'S PERFECT,  FINELY GROUND. SO I NEED FOUR OUNCES  OF PARMESAN CHEESE. JUST BE SURE YOU BUY  A BIGGER PIECE BECAUSE YOU END UP  WITH THE RIND. AND IT'S ABOUT ONE CUP,  SO I'M JUST GONNA MEASURE IT. OOH... NOBODY EVER SAID  I WAS A NEAT COOK. JUST PUT IT IN WITH THE BUTTER  AND LET THAT MIX UP. IN THE MEANTIME,  I'M GONNA GET THE THYME READY. SO I NEED ONE TEASPOON  OF THYME LEAVES. PEEL THEM RIGHT OFF THE STEMS. THIS IS THE TIME  FOR FRESH HERBS. IT REALLY MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD. DRY HERBS JUST DON'T HAVE  THE SAME KIND OF FLAVOR OR SORT OF FRESHNESS  ABOUT THEM. OKAY, SO JUST GIVE THIS  A BIG, ROUGH CHOP. OKAY, THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT  A TEASPOON. JUST RIGHT INTO THE MIX. SALT AND PEPPER,  ALWAYS IMPORTANT. SO 1/2 TEASPOON OF SALT,  I USE KOSHER SALT. I CAN SMELL THE PARMESAN,  IT'S GREAT. AND 1/2 TEASPOON OF PEPPER. AND THEN FLOUR. I NEED 1 1/4 CUPS OF FLOUR. JUST ADD IT SLOWLY. THIS IS WHY  IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE BUTTER  TO BE ROOM TEMPERATURE. IF IT'S TOO COLD  IT'LL NEVER MIX IN PROPERLY. SO THIS IS MIXING UP,  IT'S A LITTLE CRUMBLY. AND ACTUALLY  IF THE WATER CONTENT  OF THE BUTTER IS LOW I ADD A LITTLE BIT  OF EXTRA WATER AND THEN IT WILL  ALL COME TOGETHER NICELY. THAT'S ACTUALLY ALWAYS TRUE  ABOUT SHORTBREAD, I FIND, WHETHER IT'S SWEET OR SAVORY. IF THE BUTTER  IS A LITTLE BIT DRY IT WON'T ACTUALLY PULL TOGETHER. YOU WANT TO MAKE A NICE DOUGH  SO THAT'S JUST PERFECT. OKAY, I LOVE THIS KIND OF  HORS D'OEUVRES BECAUSE I CAN MAKE THE ROLL  IN ADVANCE, LEAVE IT IN  THE REFRIGERATOR, AND THEN JUST SLICE IT  AND BAKE IT BEFORE COCKTAILS. FLOURED BOARD. SO I WANT TO MAKE  A NINE-INCH ROLL. PULL THE DOUGH TOGETHER AND JUST ROLL IT OUT  UNTIL IT'S NINE INCHES LONG AND THEN IT WILL BE EXACTLY  THE RIGHT DIAMETER. OKAY, SO THAT SHOULD BE PERFECT. I'M JUST GONNA WRAP IT UP  IN PLASTIC WRAP. I'M GONNA REFRIGERATE IT  UNTIL IT'S REALLY FIRM AND THEN  JUST BEFORE SERVING THEM I'M GONNA BAKE THEM  AND THEY'RE GONNA BE SO GOOD. INTO THE FRIDGE UNTIL  THEY'RE NICE AND CHILLED  SO THEY'RE REALLY FIRM. THEN SLICE THEM 3/8 THICK, PUT THEM ON A SHEET PAN  WITH PARCHMENT PAPER, INTO THE OVEN AT 350 DEGREES  FOR 22 MINUTES EXACTLY AND THEY'RE GONNA BE PERFECT. SO THIS IS THE FOURTH  HORS D'OEUVRE OUT OF SIX -- PARMESAN AND THYME CRACKERS. I JUST LET THEM COOL A LITTLE  ON THE TRAY. A PRETTY PLATTER AND I'M DONE. THE LAST TWO,  WE'RE TALKING STORE-BOUGHT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN  THEY'RE NOT DELICIOUS. I'M GONNA START WITH SHRIMP  AND RUSSIAN DRESSING. IT'S A GREAT COMBINATION. NOW PAY ATTENTION,  THIS IS REALLY EASY. RUSSIAN DRESSING  IS JUST TWO INGREDIENTS, WHICH ARE 1/2 CUP OF KETCHUP --  USE GOOD KETCHUP, AND 1/2 CUP OF MAYONNAISE. JUST STIR IT TOGETHER. YOU CAN BUY IT ALREADY MIXED  BUT THIS IS HARDLY A RECIPE. PUT THE RUSSIAN DRESSING  IN THE MIDDLE OF A PLATTER AND ARRANGE STORE-BOUGHT,  COOKED SHRIMP AROUND IT,  AND THAT'S IT. YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS FAST  AND DELICIOUS, WATCH THIS. THESE ARE  TWO GREAT INGREDIENTS TOGETHER, HOT HOUSE CUCUMBERS AND SALAMI. SLICE A HOT HOUSE CUCUMBER  JUST ABOUT 1/4 INCH THICK. I LIKE THIS KIND  BECAUSE THE SKIN IS THINNER  THAN REGULAR CUCUMBERS AND IT'S LESS BITTER. AND THEN SLICE A SMALL SALAMI  EXACTLY THE SAME THICKNESS  AS THE CUCUMBER. I LIKE TO ARRANGE THEM  ON A RECTANGULAR PLATTER, SALAMI DOWN ONE SIDE  AND CUCUMBER DOWN THE OTHER. IT LOOKS GREAT, IT'S DELICIOUS,  AND IT'S DONE. SO THAT'S SIX HORS D'OEUVRES,  AN ENTIRE COCKTAIL PARTY, HOMEMADE, STORE-BOUGHT,  AND ASSEMBLED. AND WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M GONNA SAY, HOW EASY IS THAT? NEXT IT'S SETTING UP A BAR AND A SURPRISE COCKTAIL THAT A LOCAL BARTENDER  IS CREATING JUST FOR ME. THEN I'M MEETING YOU ALL  FOR COCKTAILS IN "ASK INA." SO NOW THAT I'VE GOT  THE FOOD COVERED I'M GONNA TURN MY ATTENTION  TO WHAT, COCKTAILS. I'M GONNA SET UP A BAR AND AFTER YEARS OF CATERING  I'VE GOT THIS DOWN TO  A SCIENCE. I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I DO IT. I USE A SIMPLE,  WHITE CATERING CLOTH  OVER A SIX-FOOT CATERING TABLE. IT LOOKS SO ELEGANT  NOT TO HAVE EXCESS FABRIC  AT THE CORNERS, SO THIS IS WHAT CATERERS DO. TO GET A BOXED EDGE  TAKE THE CORNER AT THE BACK, PULL IT OVER THE TABLE, SMOOTH IT OUT GENTLY... AND THEN TAKE THE WHOLE THING  AND FOLD IT BACK AND WHAT YOU END UP WITH  IS A COMPLETELY BOXED EDGE. IT'S VERY FLAT  AND IT'S VERY ELEGANT. NOW PAY ATTENTION -- SO MANY PEOPLE  HAVE ASKED ME HOW DO TO THIS, I'M GONNA DO IT ONE MORE TIME. TAKE THE CORNER AT THE BACK, PULL IT OVER THE TABLE, SMOOTH IT OUT NEATLY, THEN TAKE THE WHOLE THING  AND FOLD IT BACK. AND VOILA,  A COMPLETELY BOXED TABLECLOTH. AND ON WE GO. AND IF YOU WANT  SOMETHING MORE SPECIAL  THAN JUST A PLAIN, WHITE CLOTH YOU CAN TAKE A STRIPED CLOTH  AND FOLD IT DIAGONALLY  OVER THE TABLE WITH THE POINT FACING DOWN  RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. THIS IS THE WAY  I ARRANGE THE WINE GLASSES. I TAKE A ROW OF  STEMMED WINE GLASSES AND MAKE A ROW RIGHT DOWN  THE MIDDLE OF THE TABLE. THEN I MAKE A SECOND ROW  STARTING ONE GLASS IN  ON THE EDGE. AND THEN A THIRD ROW  ONE GLASS IN FROM THAT. FOR DECORATION, JUST  A SIMPLE ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS  RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. THEN THE DRINKS GO ON. FIRST THE SOFT DRINKS AND MIXERS LIKE WATER, COLA, GINGER ALE. AND A SELECTION OF ALCOHOL -- SCOTCH, VODKA, BOURBON, RUM,  WHATEVER YOU LIKE. ALL IT PLACED  AT THE BACK OF THE TABLE. AND THAT'S THE BAR. WHEN IT COMES TO COCKTAILS  I LIKE THE CLASSICS, BUT EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE  IT'S FUN TO SHAKE THINGS UP. SO I'VE ASKED MY FRIEND  GLENN LAUGHTON FROM RED BAR TO COME OVER  AND SHAKE UP A COCKTAIL FOR ME. HI, WELCOME TO RED BAR. WHEN INA CALLED I WAS THRILLED,  I WAS VERY EXCITED. I DECIDED TO CREATE A COCKTAIL  IN HER HONOR. IT'S CALLED THE INA-TINI. THIS IS MY LAST TEST  AND THEN I'M GONNA  HEAD ON OVER TO INA'S SO LET'S GO. THE FIRST THING YOU'LL NEED NICE, DELICIOUS,  PLUMP RASPBERRIES. ON TOP OF THAT  YOU WOULD PUT IN THE FRESHLY SQUEEZED JUICE  OF ONE LIME, FOLLOWED BY ROUGHLY  THREE OUNCES OF WATER,  ICE-COLD WATER. THEN YOU WOULD TOP IT OFF  WITH JUST ENOUGH SIMPLE SYRUP  TO TASTE. BASICALLY IT'S EQUAL RATIONS  OF SUGAR AND WATER. PULSE IT UNTIL YOU GET  THE CONSISTENCY OF  A NICE PUREE. SEE HOW EASY? AND THERE YOU ARE, THIS IS OUR FIRST INGREDIENT  FOR THE COCKTAIL. NOW WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD  AND MIX THE FINAL COCKTAIL. BEGIN WITH A SHAKER,  FILL IT UP WITH ICE. THEN ON TOP OF THE ICE I WOULD DO TWO OUNCES OF  A REALLY NICE ORANGE VODKA. THE SECOND INGREDIENT WOULD BE  THE LOVELY PUREE THAT WE  JUST MADE. FINALLY TOPPED BY 1/2 OUNCE OF  TRIPLE SEC. GIVE IT A GOOD SHAKE. AND NOW YOU TAKE  YOUR ALREADY CHILLED  MARTINI GLASS, A FINAL SHAKE, AND SIMPLY POUR, WITH A NICE SLICE  OF A FRESH LIME. INA, I'M ON MY WAY. IT'S 6:00 SOMEWHERE IN THE WORLD AND IT'S COCKTAIL TIME. AND I BROUGHT YOU A LITTLE SURPRISE. WHAT'D YOU BRING? IT IS SOMETHING NICE, COLD, AND REFRESHING THAT WE'RE GONNA SHAKE OVER ICE... I THINK IT'S REALLY COLD, WE LIKE NICE COLD COCKTAILS. LET'S GIVE IT A GO. SO WHAT'S IN THIS? IT'S ACTUALLY MADE WITH FRESH RASPBERRIES, THE JUICE OF A LIME, ORANGE LIQUEUR, AND A REALLY NICE ORANGE VODKA. OOH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD  AND IT LOOKS GORGEOUS. IT SMELLS DELICIOUS. YOU NEED A LIME. THANK YOU. DO WE GET TO TRY THESE? OF COURSE. CHEERS.  CHEERS,  AND WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM? IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED  AN INA-TINI. DID YOU REALLY  NAME THAT AFTER ME? I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE HAVE  SHIPS NAMED AFTER THEM. I LIKE HAVING A COCKTAIL  NAMED AFTER ME. THESE ARE DELICIOUS. HERE'S TO THE INA-TINIS.  THANK YOU, GLENN. HOW FUN IS THAT,  IT'S SO GOOD, I WANT MORE. NEXT IT'S "ASK INA," ALL YOUR COCKTAIL PARTY  QUESTIONS ANSWERED. WELL IT SEEMS THE SUBJECT OF  COCKTAIL PARTIES HAS GOTTEN  EVERYBODY FIRED UP. I'VE GOTTEN SO MANY QUESTIONS  TO "ASK INA." SO LET'S JUST SAY  THE BAR'S OPEN AND I'M ANSWERING  YOUR QUESTIONS. WHAT'S FIRST? THE FIRST ONE'S JENNIFER NEGRON. "DEAR INA, I WAS WONDERING  IF YOU HAVE A ALCOHOLIC DRINK "THAT'S FRUITY  OR NOT TOO STRONG." NOT TOO STRONG, WHY? "WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND?" JENNIFER, I HAVE  THE PERFECT DRINK FOR YOU. IT'S CALLED  JUICE OF A FEW FLOWERS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE IT  WITH OR WITHOUT ALCOHOL AND IT'S DELICIOUS BOTH WAYS. HERE'S HOW YOU MAKE IT. OKAY, FIRST YOU START WITH 1/2 CUP OF FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE. POUR IT INTO A PITCHER. THEN 1/2 CUP  OF PINK GRAPEFRUIT JUICE AND 1/4 CUP OF  FRESHLY SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE AND 1/4 CUP OF  FRESHLY SQUEEZED LIME JUICE AND ONE CUP OF GOOD VODKA. JUST STIR IT ALL TOGETHER. PUT SOME ICE CUBES  INTO A COCKTAIL SHAKER AND FILL THE SHAKER 3/4 FULL  WITH THE DRINK MIX. SHAKE IT FOR 30 SECONDS,  NOT LESS. MAKE SURE IT'S REALLY COLD. THEN POUR IT  INTO MARTINI GLASSES THAT HAVE THE RIMS  DIPPED IN SUGAR. I LIKE TO GARNISH IT  WITH A SPRIG OF FRESH MINT. IT'S SO DELICIOUS. THOSE DRINKS ARE ACTUALLY GREAT FOR BRUNCHES TOO. PEOPLE ARE SO SURPRISED  AT HOW DELICIOUS THEY ARE. OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT? HI INA, I KNOW YOU'RE A BIG FAN OF EASY APPETIZERS WHEN HOSTING A PARTY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS  FOR SKEWERED APPETIZERS THAT INCORPORATE  A VARIETY OF FLAVORS, BUT ARE SIMPLE TO MAKE  AND EAT? THANKS FOR YOUR HELP. SKEWERS ARE ACTUALLY GREAT  FOR COCKTAIL PARTIES. A DRINK IN ONE HAND  AND SKEWERS IN THE OTHER AND YOU'RE SET. I'VE GOT SOME GREAT IDEAS  FOR SKEWERED APPETIZERS. HERE THEY ARE. FIRST, SHRIMP SKEWERS. YOU MARINATE THE SHRIMP  IN BOTH DIJON MUSTARD  AND DRY MUSTARD, OLIVE OIL,  FRESH LEMON JUICE, SALT AND PEPPER, AND I LIKE CHOPPED BASIL  AND PARSLEY. THEN I JUST SKEWER THEM UP, GRILL THEM INDOORS OUR OUTDOORS, WHICHEVER YOU LIKE AND SERVE THEM WARM  OR AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. THEN CHICKEN SKEWERS  WITH SATAY DIP. PEOPLE GO CRAZY FOR THEM. IT'S JUST GRILLED CHICKEN  ON SKEWERS AND A DELICIOUS  PEANUT-Y SATAY DIP. THE DIP AND THE CHICKEN  CAN BE MADE AHEAD SO THERE'S NO STRESSING  AT THE PARTY. THE LAST QUESTION'S  FROM IRENE HENDERSON. "HI INA, I WORK 50 HOURS A WEEK "AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE  A SMALL COCKTAIL PARTY  FOR FRIENDS." "ANYTHING YOU CAN SUGGEST  ON A SMALL SCALE  THAT'S EASY..." EASY IS MY MIDDLE NAME. "AND CAN DO SOME PREP  THE NIGHT BEFORE?" "THANK YOU." ACTUALLY THERE ARE  LOTS OF IDEAS I HAVE AND YOU KNOW  WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST, IF YOU'RE WORKING ALL THE TIME  JUST GO BUY SOME THINGS, SOME NUTS, SOME NIBBLES,  SOME CHIPS, MAYBE SOME  SHARDS OF PARMESAN. AND I HAVE  A REALLY GREAT COCKTAIL THAT'S SO EASY TO MAKE  WITH CHAMPAGNE. PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT. COME WITH ME, I'LL SHOW YOU. THE FIRST ONE'S  ACTUALLY CALLED  A KIR ROYALE. IT'S MY SIGNATURE DRINK. IT'S CASSIS, WHICH IS BLACK CURRENT LIQUEUR  AND CHAMPAGNE. AND IT IS AS DELICIOUS  AS IT IS GORGEOUS. THE SECOND ONE  IS A RASPBERRY ROYALE, WHICH IS RASPBERRY LIQUEUR. YOU DON'T WANT THE EAU DE VIE, YOU ACTUALLY WANT  THE RASPBERRY LIQUEUR. I LIKE TO PUT  A FRESH RASPBERRY IN TOO. A THIRD ONE'S A MIMOSA. IS THERE ANYBODY  WHO DOESN'T KNOW  WHAT A MIMOSA IS? IT'S FRESH ORANGE JUICE  AND CHAMPAGNE. WHOO, AND LOTS OF BUBBLES. AND THE NEXT ONE  IS VERY MUCH LIKE A MIMOSA, BUT IT'S BLOOD ORANGE JUICE. SO IT'S IN SEASON  JUST IN THE FALL AND IT'S REALLY WORTH FINDING. IT'S A LITTLE MORE BITTER  THAN ORANGE JUICE AND LOOK HOW GORGEOUS IT LOOKS. IF YOU DON'T WANT  TO USE CHAMPAGNE YOU CAN ALWAYS USE  ITALIAN PROSECCO, WHICH IS LESS EXPENSIVE,  BUT ALSO DELICIOUS. AND TALKING ABOUT ITALIAN  THE LAST ONE IS RIGHT  FROM VENICE, IT'S A BELLINI IT'S FRESH PEACH JUICE  AND CHAMPAGNE AND IT'S A REAL  SPRINGTIME COCKTAIL. YOU CAN MAKE IT  WITH FRESH PEACHES, BUT WHY BOTHER. SO THAT'S MY RECIPE, IRENE, FOR THE EASIEST COCKTAIL PARTY EVER. I HOPE THAT HELPS. AND NOW I'M GONNA HAVE A COCKTAIL PARTY. I'M STARTING WITH  MY SIGNATURE DRINK AND WORKING MY WAY THROUGH. CHEERS.
