 I'M THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA, AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT  COOKING WITH HERBS. IT'S AN EASY WAY  TO GET GREAT FLAVOR. ROSEMARY'S FIRST, IN FABULOUS, JUICY  GREEK RACK OF LAMB, WHICH I SERVE OVER A COOL,  CREAMY YOGURT AND MINT SAUCE WITH THE EASIEST  FETA AND TOMATO SALAD, WITH AN OREGANO VINAIGRETTE. THIS IS THE PERFECT MENU  FOR FAMILY DINNER. THEN, MY FRIEND ELI ZABAR  IS GIVING ME A TOUR OF HIS MANHATTAN  ROOFTOP GREENHOUSES.

 HE'S MAKING  A SURPRISE HERB SALAD. THEN PARSLEY, THYME, BASIL-- WHATEVER YOUR HERB QUESTION,  I'LL TRY TO HELP, IN "ASK INA." ONE OF THE GREAT LUXURIES  OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY IS I CAN HAVE A GARDEN,  WHICH I LOVE, AND I'VE GOT LOTS OF HERBS. OF COURSE, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS  OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY IS THE DEER LIKE THE HERBS  AS MUCH AS I DO, SO I'VE GOT A SOLUTION.  I'LL SHOW YOU. THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE SURE  YOU CAN GROW HERBS AND THE DEER DON'T GET THEM  IS ENCLOSE IT. YOU CAN DO A FENCE. YOU CAN DO  ANY KIND OF ENCLOSURE, BUT YOU GOTTA KEEP THEM OUT

 SO THAT EVERYTHING ELSE  STAYS IN. SO I HAVE, LIKE, CHIVES.  THEY LOOK GORGEOUS IN THE SPRING, WHEN THEY HAVE  WONDERFUL BLUE FLOWERS. I HAVE ROSEMARY-- ACTUALLY, HERE, YOU HAVE TO  REPLANT EVERY YEAR, SADLY, BUT IT'S REALLY WORTH HAVING. I PLANT BORDERS OF THYME, AND I REPLANT THEM MAYBE  EVERY FIVE OR SIX YEARS. LOTS OF FRESH BASIL. THEY GROW WITH THE TOMATOES. WHAT GROWS TOGETHER  GOES TOGETHER. MORE BASIL. LOTS OF FRESH PARSLEY. I LOVE PARSLEY. MINT I ALWAYS GROW IN POTS, BECAUSE OTHERWISE, IT TAKES OVER THE ENTIRE GARDEN, AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE  ANYTHING ELSE BUT MINT. BUT RIGHT NOW,  I NEED LOTS OF ROSEMARY FOR THE MARINADE  FOR THE GREEK LAMB. YOU KNOW, WHEN I THINK ABOUT  MAKING A MARINADE FOR LAMB, OR ANYTHING, ACTUALLY,  I THINK ABOUT WHAT-- WHAT'S COMMONLY USED WITH IT. I DON'T NEED TO, LIKE,  REINVENT THE WHEEL EVERY TIME. AND WHEN I THINK OF LAMB,  I THINK OF GARLIC, ROSEMARY, AND MAYBE SOME LEMON. ALL KINDS OF GREEK  MEDITERRANEAN FLAVORS. SO I'M GONNA START WITH  FOUR BIG CLOVES OF GARLIC, AND INSTEAD OF USING  THE BIG FOOD PROCESSOR, I LOVE THIS LITTLE MINI CHOP.  IT'S JUST SO CONVENIENT. I NEED 3 TABLESPOONS  OF FRESH ROSEMARY, AND FORTUNATELY, I HAVE  A LOT OF IT IN MY GARDEN. JUST PEEL IT OFF THE STEMS. GIVE IT A BIG CHOP. THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT  THE COMBINATION OF LAMB AND ROSEMARY. THEY JUST GO TOGETHER,  SO WHY FIGHT IT? I MEAN, IF YOU WANTED  TO DO LAMB AND TARRAGON, THE LAMB WOULD REALLY SORT OF  OVERPOWER THE TARRAGON, BUT ROSEMARY HAS THAT SAME KIND  OF REALLY, LIKE, STRONG FLAVOR THAT WOULD STAND UP TO IT  AND COMPLEMENT IT. MY FRIEND FRANK'S COMING OVER. I KNOW HE LOVES LAMB,  SO THAT'S GOOD. SO THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT  3 GOOD TABLESPOONS OF ROSEMARY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO  CUT IT UP SO FINELY, BECAUSE I'M GONNA CHOP IT UP  IN THE MINI CHOP. I NEED A LITTLE OREGANO, 1 1/2 TEASPOONS. 1 1/2 TEASPOONS OF SALT. 3/4 OF A TEASPOON OF PEPPER. AND JUST GIVE IT A CHOP. LOOK HOW CONVENIENT THIS IS.  I LOVE THIS. SURE BEATS CHOPPING IT UP  BY HAND. SO I'M JUST GONNA MIX  THE MARINADE RIGHT IN THE DISH THAT I'M GONNA  MARINATE THE LAMB IN, SO ALL THIS JUST GOES RIGHT IN. AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA ADD  CLASSIC MARINADE INGREDIENTS. SO FIRST I HAVE FRESHLY SQUEEZED  LEMON JUICE, ABOUT 1/2 A CUP. REALLY IMPORTANT  FOR IT TO BE FRESH. 1/2 A CUP OF OLIVE OIL. IT'S LIKE MAKING  A VINAIGRETTE, ACTUALLY. LEMON JUICE, OLIVE OIL. JUST POUR IT IN. AND THEN TO ADD TO THE FLAVOR,  I'M GONNA ADD RED WINE TO IT, BUT YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY  WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S A REALLY GOOD RED WINE.  THIS IS A GOOD CôTES DU RHôNE. 1/2 A CUP OF RED WINE. I'M JUST GONNA  STIR THESE GUYS TOGETHER, JUST FOR ALL THE HERBS AND THE LEMON JUICE. SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS  I'VE TAKEN A RACK OF LAMB AND I'VE ASKED THE BUTCHER TO CUT IT INTO INDIVIDUAL CHOPS. I'M JUST GONNA PUT EACH ONE  RIGHT IN THE MARINADE. SO THIS IS GONNA MARINATE  FOR ABOUT--AT LEAST TWO HOURS. IF I HAVE TIME TO MARINATE IT  OVERNIGHT, THAT'S WHAT I DO. SO THIS IS TWO RACKS OF LAMB, WHICH MAKES 16 INDIVIDUAL CHOPS. THINK THAT'S ENOUGH  FOR FRANK AND ME? OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA  WRAP THESE UP, PUT IT IN THE FRIDGE, AND THEN I'M GONNA GET  THE GRILL ALL SET UP. READY TO GRILL THE LAMB.  IT'S BEEN MARINATING IN THE GARLIC  AND ROSEMARY, OREGANO. I'M JUST GONNA SPRINKLE IT  WITH SALT AND PEPPER JUST BEFORE I PUT IT  ON THE GRILL, OKAY, THESE ARE GONNA COOK  REALLY FAST, LIKE FOUR MINUTES ON EACH SIDE. I'VE GOT A GRILL  THAT HAS PRETTY HOT COALS, BUT IT'S JUST ONE LAYER. YOU DON'T WANT TO OVERCOOK  THESE GUYS. WHOA! SO THIS IS RACK OF LAMB,  AND IF YOU CAN ONLY BUY RACK OF LAMB WHOLE  AND YOU DON'T HAVE A BUTCHER, YOU CAN JUST CUT IT INTO CHOPS  YOURSELF. IT'S QUITE EASY. IT'S FRENCHED, WHICH MEANS THAT  THE BONES ARE CLEANED OFF. WHERE'S JEFFREY WHEN I NEED HIM? OKAY. HOT MITT. HOT FIRE. OH, I CAN REALLY SMELL  THE GARLIC AND ROSEMARY, AND THE LAMB'S GONNA BE  JUST DELICIOUS. IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD  WITH THE YOGURT AND MINT SAUCE. YUM. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH  OIL IN THE MARINADE, I ACTUALLY WOULDN'T POUR  MORE MARINADE ON IT. OTHERWISE, YOU'LL HAVE,  LIKE, AN INFERNO. I MEAN, DO THESE LOOK  DELICIOUS, OR WHAT? I THINK THE THINNER ONES  ARE DONE. I'M JUST GONNA  PUT THEM ON A PLATTER AND THEN LET THEM REST. I'M GONNA COVER THEM WITH FOIL, LET THEM REST  FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES, AND THEN ALL THE JUICES  GET BACK INTO THE LAMB. OOH, THESE LOOK SO DELICIOUS. YOU KNOW, BY THE TIME  YOU GET THE SMALL ONES OFF, THE BIGGER ONES ARE READY,  SO IT'S A GOOD SYSTEM. BOY, THAT IS  ONE GORGEOUS PLATTER OF RACK OF LAMB. COVER IT WITH FOIL, AND JUST LET ALL THE JUICES  GET BACK INTO IT. WHAT YOU WANT TO BE SURE IS DON'T EVER PUT IT  BACK IN THE MARINADE, AND DON'T USE THE MARINADE  AS A SAUCE, BECAUSE IT HAD RAW MEAT IN IT. COVER IT LIKE THAT. COVER IT REALLY SECURELY  SO IT STAYS HOT. AND WHILE THAT RESTS, I'M GONNA GET  THE REST OF THE MEAL READY. SO NEXT UP, IT'S MINT AND DILL IN A COOL, CUCUMBER  YOGURT SAUCE AND A FETA AND TOMATO SALAD WITH A WONDERFUL  OREGANO VINAIGRETTE. THEN IT'S OFF  TO MY FRIEND ELI ZABAR'S MANHATTAN ROOFTOP GARDEN, AND THEN, ALL ABOUT HERBS  IN "ASK INA." DON'T GO ANYWHERE. OKAY, I'M ON A MISSION. I NEED MINT, AND I NEED DILL FOR MY GREEK LAMB  WITH YOGURT MINT SAUCE. MY FRIEND FRANK IS COMING.  I'M GONNA MAKE IT FOR HIM. OKAY, LOTS OF MINT.  I LOVE THAT. AND DILL I JUST GROW IN POTS. I DON'T USE MUCH DILL, BUT IT'S NICE TO HAVE IT  WHEN I HAVE. WHEN I WAS THINKING  WHAT KIND OF SAUCE WOULD BE GOOD WITH THE LAMB,  I THOUGHT CLASSIC GREEK FLAVORS AGAIN,  SO YOGURT, MINT. THIS IS GONNA BE DELICIOUS. I'M MAKING  A MINT AND YOGURT SAUCE FOR IT. FIRST, I NEED A 1/2 A CUP  OF CHOPPED MINT LEAVES. YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA  CHOP UP THE LEAVES-- I COULD CERTAINLY MEASURE  A 1/2 A CUP OF LEAVES, BUT IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT  MEASUREMENT WHEN THEY'RE CHOPPED LEAVES, AND I THINK IT'S  MUCH MORE ACCURATE, AND I WANT THE FLAVORS TO BE  EXACTLY THE RIGHT PROPORTION. OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA GIVE IT  A BIG ROUGH CHOP AND THEN MEASURE IT. SO THE BASE OF THE SAUCE  IS YOGURT, AND THEN IT'S GOT  ALL KINDS OF THINGS-- MINT, DILL, SCALLIONS  TO GIVE IT A LITTLE HEAT. IT'S GONNA HAVE LOTS OF FLAVOR. SO THAT SHOULD BE  ABOUT 1/2 A CUP, RIGHT INTO THE FOOD PROCESSOR. 2 TABLESPOONS OF DILL. DILL, JUST RUN YOUR KNIFE  ALONG THE STEMS. THE STEMS OF DILL ARE TENDER,  SO IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. SO I'D SAY THAT'S ABOUT  2 TABLESPOONS CHOPPED DILL. AND SIX SCALLIONS. I'M JUST GONNA GIVE 'EM  A ROUGH CHOP, 'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA GET CUT UP  IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE  FOR DRIED HERBS. YOU WANT, REALLY, THAT FRESH  SORT OF ZING OF FRESH HERBS. PUT IT RIGHT IN. NOW FOR A LITTLE HEAT, JUST A LITTLE PINCH  OF RED PEPPER FLAKES. JUST GIVE IT A LITTLE PUNCH. A TABLESPOON OF OLIVE OIL. I'M GONNA MAKE A PASTE, WHICH I'M GONNA  ADD THE YOGURT TO. A LITTLE BIT OF LEMON JUICE,  ABOUT A TABLESPOON. JUST SQUEEZE IT RIGHT IN. OKAY, A NICE SQUEEZE OF LEMON, JUST TO GIVE IT  THAT FRESH LEMON HIT. AND JUST GRIND IT UP  INTO A COARSE PASTE, AND THAT REALLY RELEASES  ALL THE FRESH HERB FLAVOR. SO I'M JUST GONNA ADD  7 OUNCES OF YOGURT. THIS IS GREEK YOGURT, OF COURSE,  SINCE WE'RE MAKING GREEK LAMB, WHICH IS REALLY THICK YOGURT. A TEASPOON OF SALT, 1/2 A TEASPOON OF PEPPER. THINK FRANK'S GONNA  LIKE THIS FOR LUNCH? AND JUST GIVE IT A WHIRR. SO THAT'S ABOUT AS EASY  AS A SAUCE GETS, DOESN'T IT? I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE  IT TASTES GREAT. I LOVE ALL THE GREEN HERBS  IN THIS. IT'S FANTASTIC. MMM. IT'S REALLY TANGY  FROM THE YOGURT, AND THE MINT IS SO CLEAR, AND ALL THE HERBS--  OH, THIS IS JUST DELICIOUS. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY GOOD  WITH THE LAMB. SO BECAUSE IT'S  A REALLY THICK SAUCE, INSTEAD OF POURING IT  OVER THE LAMB, I'M GONNA PUT IT UNDER  THE LAMB. I'LL SHOW YOU. I'M GONNA PUT IT RIGHT DOWN  THE MIDDLE OF THIS PLATE AND THEN PUT THE LAMB  RIGHT ON TOP OF IT. THE LAMB'S RESTING.  WHEN IT'S DONE, IT'S GONNA GO RIGHT DOWN  THE MIDDLE OF THIS PLATTER. FRANK'S GONNA BE HERE  ANY MINUTE. I'M GONNA MAKE  THE QUICKEST, EASIEST TOMATO AND FETA SALAD,  WITH AN OREGANO VINAIGRETTE. THIS SALAD JUST COULDN'T  BE SIMPLER OR MORE DELICIOUS. IT'S JUST TOMATOES,  CORES REMOVED, CUT INTO BIG, THICK WEDGES. AND SOME THICK SLICES OF FETA RIGHT IN THE CENTER  OF THE PLATE. THEN DRIZZLE OVER  A GOOD OLIVE OIL... AND SOME RED WINE VINEGAR... THEN WHAT I DO IS  I TAKE THE OREGANO AND CRUSH IT BETWEEN MY HANDS. IT REALLY RELEASES THE OIL  AND THE FLAVOR OF THE OREGANO. A BIG SPRINKLING OF SALT, FRESHLY GROUND BLACK PEPPER, AND FINALLY, BECAUSE IT NEEDS  A LITTLE GREEN, I PUT SOME ARUGULA  AROUND THE OUTSIDE. THE PEPPERINESS IS GOOD WITH IT. AND THE SALAD'S DONE. WELL, HOW GOOD DOES THIS LOOK? SALAD'S DONE.  THE SAUCE IS DONE. ALL I HAVE TO DO IS  PLATE UP THE LAMB. SO I'M GONNA PUT THE LAMB ON WITH THEIR LITTLE LEGS CROSSING. LET'S SEE HOW THIS GOES.  JUST LIKE THAT. AND JUST REST THEM  RIGHT ON THE SAUCE. OH, THEY'RE SO JUICY. OH! GRILL SOME LAMB,  AND A MAN SHOWS UP. WORKS EVERY TIME. THAT'S FANTASTIC. SO IT'S GRILLED  GREEK LAMB-- WITH SOME FABULOUS SAUCE.  IT'S GOT A YOGURT  AND MINT SAUCE. IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.  SO YOU--YOU READY  FOR A LITTLE DINNER? I AM, INDEED.  YEAH? OUTSIDE IN THE GARDEN?  WHAT DO YOU THINK? SURE. AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING  ABOUT THE GARDEN. THAT SOUNDS GREAT.  CAN I--  HOW ABOUT ONE MORE? ONE MORE?  YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT. JUST ONE MORE.  AND MAYBE A LITTLE  LEMON ON THE END. JUST IN CASE.  DOES THAT LOOK GOOD? PERFECT. IT IS BEAUTIFUL. OKAY, YOU TAKE THE LAMB... I GOT IT. I'LL TAKE THE TOMATO SALAD. PERFECT. WE CAN IMAGINE OURSELVES  IN MYKONOS. DON'T TELL JEFFREY. NEXT UP, I'M HEADING  TO NEW YORK TO CHECK OUT MY FRIEND  ELI ZABAR'S GREENHOUSES, AND HE'S RUSTLING UP  A MYSTERY HERB SALAD. THEN, IF YOU HAVE  AN HERB QUESTION, I HAVE AN ANSWER,  IN "ASK INA." MY FRIEND ELI ZABAR  JUST KNOCKS ME OUT. HE HAS A SPECIALTY FOOD STORE  IN THE MIDDLE OF MANHATTAN CALLED THE VINEGAR FACTORY,  AND HE THOUGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW, IF I GOT A GREENHOUSE,  I COULD GROW TOMATOES. AND LOOK WHAT HE BUILT.  IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ELI'S GONNA SHOW ME HOW TO MAKE  AN HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD WITH FRESH HERBS,  AND I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT. LOOK AT THESE TOMATOES.  THEY'RE, LIKE, EVERYWHERE. IT'S INCREDIBLE. THESE ARE THE HEIRLOOMS,  UH, INA. OH, THAT'S--  YOU KNOW, ALL THESE ARE HEIRLOOM TOMATOES. AND ELI HAS INCREDIBLE, LIKE,  GREEN ONES AND ORANGE ONES, AND--AND THEY HAVE  SO MUCH FLAVOR. RIGHT. YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE  THAT TOMATOES WERE GROWN FOR SHIPPABILITY, BUT HERE,  THEY'RE GROWN FOR FLAVOR. SO CAN YOU KEEP  THE WHOLE--THE RESTAURANT AND THE SPECIALTY  FOOD STORES GOING, OR IS THIS LIKE ALL OF  MANHATTAN YOU KEEP GOING? WELL, WE--WE WOULD HAVE BEEN  ABLE TO DO ALL OF MANHATTAN IF WE HAD PLANTED AT THE RIGHT  TIME AND THE RIGHT VARIETIES. EVERY GARDENER SAYS THAT. RIGHT, BUT IT'S THE FISH THAT GOT AWAY, RIGHT?  THAT'S WHAT IT IS.  EXACTLY, IF ONLY. HEY! LOOK AT--  OH, MY GOD. INA, LOOK WHAT I'VE GOT FOR YOU.  LOOK AT THIS.  OH, MY GOD. DO YOU THINK I CAN EAT  ALL THESE TOMATOES? LOOK AT-- OH, THESE ARE  THE GREEN ZEBRAS I LIKE. THAT'S RIGHT, RIGHT. THOSE ARE FANTASTIC.  LOVE THEM. RIGHT. THOSE ARE  REALLY NICE. AND I LOVE THESE  PINK ONES, AND-- I THINK THAT'S CALLED ANNA PURPLE, THIS PURPLE ONE.  THE PURPLE ONE? YOU SEE THIS PURPLE ONE HERE?  OOH, HOW GORGEOUS IS THAT? IT'S PURPLE. ISN'T THAT NICE?  OOH, THAT'S SO GORGEOUS. RIGHT.  SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE  A TOMATO SALAD FROM THIS? ABSOLUTELY.  OH, FANTASTIC.  COME WITH ME. OKAY, LET'S GET SOME HERBS AND GO DOWN THERE AND DO IT. THIS IS GONNA BE  THE BEST TOMATO SALAD EVER. NOBODY IN THE WORLD HAS INSPIRED ME MORE THAN ELI ZABAR, AND IT'S BECAUSE YOU TAKE REALLY  SIMPLE, DELICIOUS INGREDIENTS AND MAKE SOMETHING  FABULOUS OUT OF THEM. SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE  A TOMATO SALAD. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT  YOU ALWAYS DO THAT AMAZES ME IS YOU TAKE, LIKE,  BIG SLICES OF BIG TOMATOES AND THEN YOU PUT WEDGES  OF TOMATOES ON TOP AND CHERRY TOMATOES.  SO SHALL WE DO THAT? YEP, LET'S DO IT. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA MAKE  TOMATOES WITH TARRAGON. SO WHAT ARE THESE  GORGEOUS BIG TOMATOES? ALL RIGHT, LET ME-- LET ME SHOW YOU THIS GUY HERE.  OKAY. OH, I LOVE THAT. NOW THAT'S THE--OKAY.  SO YOU'RE GONNA SLICE IT IN BIG, THICK SLICES? YEAH, LET'S DO-- LET'S DO NICE, BIG, FAT SLICES  ON THESE GUYS, YOU KNOW?  THIS IS FANTASTIC. AND TARRAGON HAS THIS  VERY DELICATE FLAVOR, SORT OF LIKE  AN ANISE FLAVOR. RIGHT. IT JUST GOES SO WELL  WITH TOMATOES. SO SHALL I PUT THESE ON?  PLEASE, WOULD YOU HELP ME THERE, INA? OKAY, I HELP--I'M HELPING.  I LOVE THIS. HOW FABULOUS. GREAT. RIGHT. LET'S GET SOME COLOR IN IT.  OKAY, GREAT. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GET THIS GUY IN HERE, TOO.  GREEN ONES. GET SOME GREEN ONES.

ACTUALLY, I'M AMAZED HOW MUCH  SALT TOMATOES NEED... OKAY. TO HAVE FLAVOR, AND EVERYBODY'S  ALWAYS NERVOUS ABOUT IT. AND ELI HAS THIS INCREDIBLE  COARSE SEA SALT. LOOK AT THIS.  IT'S FABULOUS. IT REALLY JUST NEEDS  A LOT OF SALT ON IT, RIGHT? YEAH. WE'RE GONNA SURPRISE EVERYBODY  AND ONLY USE VINEGAR...  REALLY? IN THIS SALAD.  NO OLIVE OIL? NO OLIVE OIL.  OKAY. AND--AND THE REASON, INA, IS THAT A TOMATO IS A FRUIT...  YEAH. AND THERE'S A LOT OF SUGAR  IN THAT--IN THAT FRUIT.  YEAH. AND WHEN WE PUT THE VINEGAR  AND THE SALT, WE'RE GONNA SUCK OUT--WE'RE GONNA DRAW OUT THAT SWEET SUGAR, AND THEN WE'RE--THAT'S GONNA  BE THE ACTUAL DRESSING. OH, SO ACTUALLY THE JUICE OF  THE TOMATO MAKES THE DRESSING. EXACTLY, EXACTLY.  HOW FABULOUS IS THAT? OKAY, SO WE--WE'RE GONNA  GIVE IT A-A HEAVY DOSE BECAUSE WE WANT EVERYTHING TO...  AND ELI USES... KIND OF MARINATE.  REALLY GOOD  RED WINE VINEGAR. OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT? OH, THE TARRAGON, INA. THE TARRAGON, GREAT. YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS  THINK OF BASIL AND TOMATOES, BUT ELI THINKS OF TARRAGON  AND TOMATOES. SO HOW ARE-- OH, I LOVE THIS. YOU'RE GONNA  JUST DO IT WITH THE SCISSORS? YEAH, WE'LL JUST DO IT, UH, THE QUICK WAY.  I MEAN, FORGET PEELING OFF  LEAF BY LEAF. YEAH.  HOW GORGEOUS IS THAT? GIVE IT A LITTLE HAIRCUT.  OH, AND THE TARRAGON  SMELLS AMAZING. GIVE IT A HAIRCUT.

ARE YOU--AM I IN CHARGE  OF PEPPER? YOU'RE THE PEPPER  GIRL, YEAH.  OKAY, GREAT.  I LOVE PEPPER. A LITTLE PEPPER ON TOP. YEP, I THINK THAT WAS REALLY GOOD. I THINK WE SALTED IT  ENOUGH, THOUGH.  YOU CAN NEVER TOO-- SALT IT TOO MUCH. BUT WE'LL GIVE IT  A LITTLE-- A LITTLE MORE VINEGAR?  A LITTLE SHAMPOO WITH THE VINEGAR HERE. OKAY, ALL RIGHT.  SO CAN I TASTE IT? DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY.  WELL, I THINK YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LET IT SET  FOR ABOUT TEN MINUTES--  I CAN'T WAIT. OKAY, ALL RIGHT.  HOW'S THAT? ARE YOU GONNA TASTE IT?  OH, YEAH. THIS IS FOR ME? OOH, I LOVE IT.  THAT'S FOR YOU. OKAY. MMM. OH, MY GOD, IT'S SO GOOD. I ALWAYS THINK OF BASIL  WITH TOMATOES. FORGET BASIL.  TARRAGON'S AMAZING. THAT IS SO DELICIOUS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I LOVE YOUR TOMATO SALADS. UP NEXT, IT'S TIME FOR ME  TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS ALL ABOUT HERBS, IN "ASK INA." DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I LOVE THIS PART. IT'S "ASK INA,"  AND IT'S ALL ABOUT HERBS. I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I'M ON A GAME  SHOW. DO I GET A LIFELINE? OKAY, THE FIRST QUESTION  IS FROM BILL BANKS. Hi, Ina. HI, BILL. I watch your show all the time, and I have a question  about herbs. When you're cooking  and you say, use, uh, 2 tablespoons  of fresh thyme, what would that equate to using ground spice? YOU KNOW, BILL, I ACTUALLY DON'T USE DRIED HERBS THAT MUCH. I LOVE FRESH HERBS. I THINK THE ESSENTIAL OILS  ARE IN THE LEAVES. I LIKE THE SPRINKLING  OF SOMETHING GREEN. I LIKE THE TEXTURE. DRIED HERBS, THE CONVERSION--  I HAVE NO IDEA. IT DEPENDS ON HOW LONG IT'S BEEN  SITTING IN YOUR DRAWER. SOMETIMES IT'S  BEEN THERE AWHILE. IN THE GROCERY STORE, IT COULD  HAVE BEEN THERE FOR A YEAR, YOU HAVE NO IDEA,  SO FRESH HERBS ARE GOOD FOR ME, AND I'M GONNA PROVE IT TO YOU  BY SHOWING MY SPICE DRAWER. THE ONLY TWO HERBS I USE DRIED  ARE OREGANO-- I JUST FIND FRESH OREGANO  WAY TOO STRONG. IT OVERPOWERS EVERYTHING--  AND BAY LEAVES. I DON'T KNOW WHY.  I JUST USE DRIED BAY LEAVES. I THINK THEY'RE PERFECTLY FINE. THE REST OF THIS DRAWER--  IT'S ALL SPICES. I THINK GROCERY STORES  ACROSS AMERICA-- EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM  HAS FRESH HERBS NOW. IT'S REALLY WORTH USING THEM. I THINK THEY MAKE  A BIG DIFFERENCE. WELL, THAT WAS FUN. OKAY, THE SECOND QUESTION  IS FROM DEBORAH WILEY. "INA, LOVE YOUR SHOW.  YOU COOK WITH FRESH HERBS, "SO FOR A NEWBIE COOK,  WHAT TWO TO THREE HERBS "WOULD YOU SUGGEST  I GROW IN MY KITCHEN? WHAT DO YOU ALWAYS GO TO?  THANKS." I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S PERSONAL. I THINK YOU SHOULD GROW  WHATEVER THREE HERBS YOU LOVE. I MEAN, FOR ME,  IT'S PROVENçAL HERBS. ROSEMARY, THYME, BASIL. I USE THEM ALL THE TIME. BUT IF YOU LIKE PARSLEY, IF YOU LIKE CHIVES--  SOME GOOD ONION FLAVOR-- OR EVEN SOMETHING  A LITTLE MORE ESOTERIC, LIKE FRENCH TARRAGON,  I'D GROW THOSE. OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT?  Hi, Ina. I like to cook with fresh basil  whenever I get a chance to, and I was thinking of starting  to grow it at home, but I noticed there's  a lot of varieties out there to choose from,  so I wanted to see if maybe you had  some advice for me. MIKE, I THINK THERE MUST BE  A MILLION KINDS OF BASIL, BUT THE MOST COMMON ONE  IS AN ITALIAN VARIETY CALLED GENOVESE, AND I HOPE  I'M PRONOUNCING THAT RIGHT. BUT IT'S THE BIG  GREEN LEAF BASIL, AND IT'S THE ONE I USE  ALL THE TIME. GENOVESE HAS LOTS OF FLAVOR, AND IT KEEPS  REPLENISHING ITSELF. THE MORE YOU PICK IT  FROM THE SAME PLANT, THE MORE IT GROWS, AND IT JUST  KEEPS GOING ALL SUMMER LONG. OKAY, I HOPE THAT HELPS, MIKE. Hi, Ina. This is Kim  from Philadelphia. HI, KIM.  I love your show. I've bought some fresh herbs  from the farm stand, and I can't keep them fresh  longer than two days. Do you have any ideas? Thanks. THAT'S AN EASY ONE, KIM. I STORE CUT HERBS  IN THE REFRIGERATOR, AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I DO IT. IF I PICK THEM IN THE GARDEN OR BRING THEM HOME  FROM THE STORE, I WASH THEM,  DRY THEM REALLY CAREFULLY, AND THEN PUT THEM  IN SEALED PLASTIC BAGS, AND THEN I PUT THEM  IN THE REFRIGERATOR. THAT WAY, THEY'LL REALLY LAST. KIM WAS ASKING ME  ABOUT FRESH HERBS. WHEN I HAVE A LOT,  I SOMETIMES FREEZE THEM. I JUST MINCE THEM UP  WITH A SHARP KNIFE. I DON'T USE A FOOD PROCESSOR, 'CAUSE OTHERWISE,  THEY GET REALLY WATERY. AND THEN I SPOON THEM INTO  ICE CUBE TRAYS AND FREEZE THEM, AND THEN, WHEN I WANT  SOME FRESH HERBS, I JUST POP THEM STRAIGHT INTO  A SOUP OR A STEW RIGHT FROM THE ICE CUBE TRAY. THAT WAY, I HAVE DELICIOUS  FRESH HERBS ALL YEAR ROUND. WHO KNEW THERE WAS SO MUCH TO  SAY ABOUT HERBS? HAVE FUN.
