 I'M THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA,  AND THIS IS ALL ABOUT COOKIES. YOU'VE GOT IT--JUST COOKIES. WHO DOESN'T LOVE  MOIST AND CHEWY CHOCOLATE CHUNK BLONDIES AND CRISP, THIN  CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES? AMAZINGLY, THEY'RE MADE  FROM THE SAME BATTER. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE  IS HOW YOU BAKE THEM, AND I'D CALL THAT  DOUBLE DELICIOUS. THEN I'M LEARNING HOW TO MAKE  ADORABLE ICED ANIMAL COOKIES FROM PATTI PAIGE, WHO'S  THE MOST CREATIVE BAKER I KNOW, AND SINCE I THINK THE ANSWER  TO MOST OF LIFE'S PROBLEMS

 IS A GOOD COOKIE, I'M LOOKING  FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU IN "ASK INA." I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED  HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAN MAKE THE MOISTEST  CHOCOLATE CHUNK BLONDIES FROM EXACTLY THE SAME  BATTER THAT YOU MAKE THE THINNEST, CRISPEST  CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES? BUT IT'S TRUE.  I'LL SHOW YOU HOW. SO FIRST I'M GONNA MAKE  THE BLONDIES. FIRST THING I NEED IS  1/2 A POUND OF BUTTER. IT'S UNSALTED BUTTER  AND IT'S AT ROOM TEMPERATURE, AND NOT JUST SOFTENED,  BUT REALLY ROOM TEMPERATURE. IT'S THE BEST WAY  TO CREAM BUTTER. ONE CUP OF BROWN SUGAR--  I USE LIGHT BROWN SUGAR. IF YOU HAVE DARK BROWN SUGAR,  I'M SURE IT'S NOT A PROBLEM-- 
  subslikescript square adaptive  
 
 LIGHTLY PACKED, AND 1/2 A CUP  OF GRANULATED SUGAR... AND JUST CREAM THAT  FOR A FEW MINUTES UNTIL IT'S REALLY  LIGHT AND FLUFFY. OKAY, WHILE THAT'S ON, I'M GONNA GET  THE DRY INGREDIENTS TOGETHER, SO THE FIRST THING I NEED IS 2 CUPS OF ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. I ALWAYS LIKE TO SIFT  THE DRY INGREDIENTS TOGETHER. IT COMBINES THEM, AND ALSO MAKES  SURE THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE THAT YOU DON'T WANT  IN YOUR BLONDIES. 1 TEASPOON OF BAKING SODA AND 1 TEASPOON OF KOSHER SALT. JUST SIFT THAT TOGETHER. PERFECT. NOW THE BUTTER AND SUGAR SHOULD  BE JUST PERFECTLY CREAMED, AND IT IS. OKAY, NEXT IS VANILLA. VANILLA'S REALLY  IMPORTANT IN BLONDIES 'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY FLAVORS THE BATTER, AND OF COURSE, VANILLA AND  CHOCOLATE ALWAYS GO TOGETHER. THAT'S 1 TEASPOON  AND 2, AND THEN TWO EGGS AT ROOM  TEMPERATURE, ONE AT A TIME. JUST LET THEM  MIX INTO THE BATTER. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, ALSO, THAT THE EGGS ARE AT  ROOM TEMPERATURE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE  THEY'LL MAKE THE BUTTER COLD, AND YOU'VE JUST  WASTED ALL YOUR TIME. OKAY, LOW SPEED--NOW I'M GONNA  ADD THE DRY INGREDIENTS. AND JUST ADD THEM SLOWLY. THIS IS WHERE YOU DON'T--DON'T  WANT TO OVERBEAT THE BATTER. YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO ADD IT  IN ONE CLUMP, OTHERWISE YOU'LL HAVE  BITS OF FLOUR IN THE DOUGH. OKAY, THAT'S THE DOUGH. SO I'M JUST--  JUST SCRAPE THIS DOWN. MAKE SURE I GET ALL THE BATTER  IN THE BLONDIES. YOU CAN ACTUALLY JUST DO IT  WITH YOUR HANDS. IT'S THE--CLEAN HANDS ARE  A COOK'S BEST TOOLS, RIGHT? MUCH FASTER. OKAY, NOW I NEED LOTS OF CHOCOLATE CHUNKS AND WALNUTS, AND I'M JUST GONNA  FOLD THEM IN BY HAND. FIRST I HAVE 1 1/2 CUPS  OF CHOPPED WALNUTS AND 1 1/4 POUNDS  OF CHOCOLATE CHUNKS. THAT'S LIKE ABOUT  ONE AND A QUARTER PACKAGES. AND JUST FOLD THEM IN BY HAND. OH, THAT LOOKS LIKE  A LOT OF CHOCOLATE CHUNKS. THAT JUST MEANS THEY'RE GONNA BE  REALLY GOOD BLONDIES. SO THESE ARE  SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE CHUNKS. YOU CAN USE CHOCOLATE CHIPS  IF YOU PREFER, BUT THESE HAVE MORE, LIKE,  REALLY GREAT CHOCOLATE FLAVOR. OKAY, INTO THE PAN. SO THIS BATTER CAN EITHER BE  VERY THIN, CRISP COOKIES, BUT RIGHT NOW I'M GONNA  MAKE BLONDIES WITH 'EM. SO THIS IS  AN 8 1/2x12x2-INCH PAN. I'M JUST GONNA DUMP  THE WHOLE THING IN-- I MEAN, TELL ME  THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD-- AND JUST SPREAD IT ALL OUT. YOU CAN SOMETIMES ACTUALLY  DO THIS WITH WET FINGERS, BUT I'LL USE A SPATULA. OKAY, THIS IS GONNA  GO INTO THE OVEN, 350 DEGREES  FOR EXACTLY 30 MINUTES, AND THAT'LL GIVE ME  JUST ENOUGH TIME TO SHOW YOU HOW  THE EXACT SAME BATTER WILL MAKE THIN, CRISP  CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES, AND THEY'RE JUST AS GOOD. YOU MAKE AN IDENTICAL DOUGH,  CHANGE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, THEN DROP SCOOPS OF BATTER  ONTO A BAKING SHEET LINED WITH PARCHMENT PAPER WITH A 1 3/4-INCH  ROUND ICE CREAM SCOOP-- IT'S A SMALL SCOOP--  OR YOU CAN USE A TABLESPOON. I KNOW SOME PEOPLE LIKE  THEIR COOKIES THICK AND CHEWY. I LIKE MINE  CRISP ON THE OUTSIDE AND CREAMY ON THE INSIDE, AND THE CHOCOLATE CHUNKS  MAKE THEM REALLY GOOEY. THEN JUST DAMPEN YOUR HANDS  A LITTLE BIT AND FLATTEN THE DOUGH SLIGHTLY. OKAY, INTO THE OVEN, 350  DEGREES FOR EXACTLY 15 MINUTES. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT  TO UNDERBAKE THE COOKIES, JUST LIKE UNDERBAKING  THE BLONDIES, TO GET THE RIGHT TEXTURE. WHEN THE TIME'S UP,  TAKE THEM OUT. THEY WILL SEEM UNDERDONE,  BUT THEY WON'T BE, TRUST ME. JUST LET THEM COOL SLIGHTLY. TRANSFER THEM TO A WIRE RACK  TO COOL COMPLETELY. SO THAT'S HOW  THE COOKIES TURNED OUT. LET'S SEE HOW THE BLONDIES DO. SO THE KEY TO THE BLONDIES IS  IF YOU PUT A TOOTHPICK IN, IT WON'T QUITE COME OUT CLEAN,  AND THAT MEANS THEY'RE DONE. YOU WANT THEM REALLY UNDERDONE. PERFECT, JUST A LITTLE WET. OKAY, WHILE THESE COOL,  COME WITH ME TO THE PANTRY. I WANT TO SHOW YOU  THE CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES. NOW AREN'T THOSE GORGEOUS? MMM, MY GOD,  I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT ONE. I'M GONNA PUT THEM SIDE BY SIDE  WITH THE BLONDIES, AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE  THE SAME, BUT SO DIFFERENT. SO THAT'S ONE BATTER, TWO WAYS. COULD THEY POSSIBLY  LOOK MORE DIFFERENT? NOW WHICH ONE AM I GONNA TRY?  HMM... I THINK I MIGHT  TRY BOTH OF THEM. SO GOOD. IT'S ALL COOKIES ALL THE TIME. NEXT I'M GETTING A CLASS  IN ANIMAL COOKIES FROM MY FRIEND PATTI PAIGE. THEN IT'S "ASK INA," AND IF  YOUR COOKIES ARE CRUMBLING, I'M HERE TO HELP. THE THING ABOUT COOKING IS  YOU NEVER STOP LEARNING. MY FRIEND PATTI PAIGE  IS HERE TO SHOW ME HOW TO MAKE THESE UNBELIEVABLE DOG COOKIES. AREN'T THEY ADORABLE? PATTI OWNS A BUSINESS IN NEW YORK CALLED BAKED IDEAS, AND SHE'S MADE CAKES AND COOKIES  AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS. WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU USED TO MAKE FOR US AT BAREFOOT CONTESSA?  WELL, ONE OF THE COOKIES  WE MADE WAS A BEACH BLANKET COOKIE... OH. WITH A SUNBATHER LYING ON IT  WITH SUNGLASSES-- AND SUN--IT HAD SUNGLASSES... SUNTAN LOTION, NEWSPAPER-- SUNTAN LOTION ON THE COOKIE. IT WAS REALLY UNBELIEVABLE. THOSE WERE FUN, YEAH. THEY WERE GREAT. A FEW MONTHS AGO, PATTI MADE THE MOST AMAZING CAKE FOR ME, AND IT WAS FOR A BENEFIT.  WAIT TILL YOU SEE THIS. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. THE GALA WAS AT  THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY IN THE WHALE ROOM,  FOR THE 100th ANNIVERSARY OF THE ANIMAL MEDICAL CENTER  IN NEW YORK. PATTI USED ONE OF MY CHOCOLATE  CAKE RECIPES FOR THE CAKE, AND THEN SHE SCULPTED IT  INTO THE SHAPE OF NOAH'S ARK, AND THEN SHE  DECORATED IT WITH PAIRS OF THE MOST ADORABLE ANIMAL  COOKIES YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THE ANIMAL MEDICAL CENTER  TREATS ANY ANIMALS YOU CAN FIT IN  A NEW YORK CITY TAXI, SO PATTI MADE TAXIS  OUT OF COOKIES THAT WERE PULLING UP  TO THE ARK. IT WAS SO ADORABLE. PATTI, THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.  THANKS. THE CAKE IS DELICIOUS, THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS, AND THE COOKIES ARE AMAZING. ARE YOU GONNA COME TO EAST HAMPTON?  I'D LOVE TO. I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW  HOW TO DO THAT, AND SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK  THAT'S EASY, BUT I'M HOPING YOU CAN  TEACH ME.  DEFINITELY. THAT'S REALLY FUN. NOT ONLY DID PATTI MAKE THE CAKE AND THE COOKIES ON IT, BUT SHE MADE  AN INDIVIDUAL COOKIE FOR EVERYBODY AT THE PARTY,  SO THESE ARE LITTLE DOGS. AREN'T THEY--IS THAT  THE MOST ADORABLE? I THINK THIS MIGHT BE  MY FAVORITE, THOUGH. IS THAT THE SWEETEST DOG  YOU EVER SAW? EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET A SWEET PET TO TAKE HOME FROM THE EVENT. THE GALA WAS A DAZZLING AFFAIR AND EVERYONE  ADORED THE ARK CAKE. IT WAS A REAL SHOWSTOPPER, AND MY FRIEND BOBBY LIBERMAN,  WHO'S CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, - ADORED IT. - WELL, I WANT TO THANK THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA,  INA GARTEN... AND, INA, YOU'RE  THE MOST GENEROUS FRIEND, ESPECIALLY FOR  A PERSON WHOSE ANIMALS ONLY COME OUT  OF YOUR PASTRY KITCHEN. THEN WITH THE SPEECHES OVER,  IT WAS ALL DOWN TO THE EATING. PATTI'S BROUGHT EVERYTHING WE NEED TO DECORATE THESE COOKIES, BUT FIRST I NEED TO KNOW HOW YOU MADE THESE ADORABLE SHORTBREAD DOGS. WELL, THEN LET ME TELL YOU. FOR THE DOUGH,  I MIX 3/4 OF A POUND OF ROOM TEMPERATURE BUTTER WITH 2 1/4 CUPS OF SUGAR. WHEN THEY'RE CREAMED TOGETHER, I ADD THREE LARGE EGGS AND A TABLESPOON  OF VANILLA EXTRACT, AND THEN IT'S TIME  TO ADD THE DRY INGREDIENTS. THIS IS A MIXTURE OF 24 OUNCES  OF ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR, 1 1/4 TEASPOONS  OF BAKING POWDER, AND 3/4 TEASPOON OF SALT. WHEN EVERYTHING'S COMBINED, I TURN THE DOUGH OUT, WRAP IT IN PLASTIC, AND CHILL IT UNTIL IT'S FIRM. THEN I ROLL IT OUT  TO ABOUT 1/8 OF AN INCH THICK AND GET TO WORK  WITH THE CUTTER. THIS DOUGH MAKES  ABOUT 30 TO 45 COOKIES. PUT THEM ON A BAKING SHEET, AND BAKE THEM AT 350 DEGREES  FOR 8 TO 12 MINUTES, DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE. SO THE NEXT THING IS ICING THE COOKIES. WHAT DO YOU HAVE?  RIGHT. WELL, THE FIRST STEP  IS TO OUTLINE THE COOKIE, SO WE'RE GONNA  DO THAT IN WHITE, BECAUSE THAT'S THE COLOR  WE'RE GONNA USE FOR THE-- WHAT KIND OF ICING  DO YOU USE? THIS IS ROYAL ICING.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW I MAKE IT. IT'S JUST A POUND  OF CONFECTIONERS' SUGAR... THREE LARGE EGG WHITES, 1/2 A TEASPOON OF LEMON JUICE, AND YOU JUST BEAT IT TOGETHER  ON MEDIUM SPEED IN A MIXER FITTED  WITH A PADDLE ATTACHMENT UNTIL IT'S COMPLETELY MIXED AND THE ICING  IS THICK AND WHITE. THIS IS THE FUN PART. OKAY, HOW DO WE DO THIS? YOU JUST LET IT FALL  INTO THE BAG. IT CAN GET A LITTLE MESSY.  A LITTLE MESSY? IT'S GONNA BE REALLY MESSY. YOUR IS GONNA BE A LITTLE MESSY.  MINE'S GONNA BE VERY MESSY. WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO FIRST?  FIRST WE'RE GONNA  OUTLINE THE COOKIE. IT HELPS TO KEEP  THE ICING IN LATER WHEN YOU'RE PAINTING  THE LOOSER STUFF ON. YEAH. I TEND TO FOLD THIS OVER... OH, OKAY. SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE SQUEEZING,  IT DOESN'T LEAK OUT THE TOP, SO YOU--YEAH.  THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. MINE ALWAYS LEAKS OUT THE TOP. OKAY, GOOD.  GET ALL THE PRESSURE ON THE ICING HERE, SO... OH, LOOK AT THAT. JUST THE THINNEST LINE. ALL RIGHT, SO WE'LL  TAKE A COOKIE. ON MOST COOKIES, I TEND  TO START ON THE LEFT BECAUSE I LIKE TO BE  DRAGGING MY ICING... OH. BEHIND ME. AND THAT'S IF YOU'RE RIGHT-HANDED, RIGHT? EXACTLY. OKAY, SO-- SO AGAIN, WHEN YOU START,  YOU TOUCH DOWN, ATTACH THE ICING  TO THE COOKIE, AND THEN LET IT  FALL FROM THE TIP. BECAUSE THAT WAY YOU GET A REALLY NICE,  SMOOTH, FLUID LINE. OH, ISN'T THAT  INTERESTING? MM-HMM. WELL, YOU GET A NICE,  SMOOTH, FLUID LINE. I GET A MORE CHARMING  JAGGED LINE. WELL, THAT'S GOOD, TOO,  BECAUSE THE DOG HAS FUR, SO YOU CAN MAKE IT  A LITTLE JAGGED.  OH, YEAH. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. YEAH, SO THEN YOU-- OH, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. IF YOU LET IT JUST FALL ONTO THE COOKIE...  EXACTLY. RATHER THAN TRY AND--  YOU ACTUALLY PULL OUT SOME ICING AND THEN JUST LET IT...  EXACTLY. FALL DOWN.  AND THEN, LIKE, RIGHT HERE,  THERE'S A LITTLE TINY DETAIL WHICH BECOMES THE EAR LATER,  SO I'M GONNA CATCH THAT. OH, LOOK AT THAT.  AND THEN I'M GONNA-- OOPS, I MISSED THAT.  IT DOESN'T MATTER. AND THEN YOU END BY-- OKAY, HERS LOOKS PERFECT. MINE'S NOT TERRIBLE, RIGHT?  THAT LOOKS GREAT. NO, THAT'S GONNA BE GREAT. MINE LOOKS LIKE  A LOT OF FUR. OKAY, GOOD. OH, THIS IS FABULOUS.  SO THAT JUST TAKES  A MINUTE TO SET, AND THEN WE'LL FILL IT IN  WITH MORE ICING. OH, GREAT. I CAN'T WAIT. COMING UP,  IT'S COOKIE ART AS WE PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES  TO OUR ANIMAL COOKIES. THEN IT'S "ASK INA,"  AND I'M HERE TO HELP WITH YOUR  TOUGH COOKIE QUESTIONS. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I'M GETTING A COOKIE CLASS FROM MY FRIEND PATTI PAIGE. SHE'S MADE THESE ADORABLE COOKIES. THEY'RE DOG COOKIES.  THEY'RE SO GREAT. AND SHE'S GONNA SHOW ME HOW  TO ICE THEM. WHAT'S NEXT?  ALL RIGHT, WELL,  WE'RE GONNA TAKE ABOUT 1/4 OF A CUP  OF THE THICKER ROYAL ICING. THIS IS REALLY THICK ICING.  SO NOW I'M JUST GONNA ADD  A TEASPOON OF EGG WHITE TO THIN THE ICING OUT. IF YOU WANTED TO USE WATER,  YOU COULD DO THAT AS WELL. WE'RE GONNA START  WITH 1/4 TEASPOON... OF EGG WHITES? OF EGG WHITES. OH, I LIKE THIS. SHE HAS IT  IN A SQUEEZE THING. THAT'S EASIER TO CONTROL, ISN'T IT?  EXACTLY. THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S REALLY SMART.  SO THE CONSISTENCY  I'M LOOKING FOR HERE IS LIKE THE CONSISTENCY  OF MAPLE SYRUP. OH, SO IT REALLY JUST DRIPS BACK.  IT DRIPS BACK IN AND IT KINDA DISAPPEARS INTO  WHAT WAS ALREADY IN THE BOWL, THEN YOU PRETTY MUCH  KNOW YOU'RE READY. PERFECT. SO WE'RE GONNA  TAKE THE COOKIE... I'M WATCHING, FIRST.  AND YOUR BRUSH. OKAY, THIS IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE TRICKY FOR SOME PEOPLE. YOU WANT TO GET A BUNCH OF ICING  ON YOUR BRUSH AND DO A TWIRL SO THAT IT DOESN'T DRIP  ONTO THE EDGE OF THE COOKIE, AND YOU WANT TO GET  A FEW DOLLOPS OF ICING ONTO YOUR COOKIE, AND THEN YOU START  PUSHING THE ICING AROUND. IT'S REALLY NOT PAINTING, IN THAT YOU'RE NOT HITTING  THE SURFACE OF THE COOKIE. YOU'RE JUST GENTLY  PUSHING THE ICING AROUND. OKAY, SEE,  YOU KEEP FILLING IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS  OF THE COOKIE, BUT YOU DON'T EVER LET  THE ICING GET THIN, AND I ALSO TRY TO COVER  THE EDGE WHILE I'M PAINTING. IT HAPPENS KIND OF  AUTOMATICALLY. OH, YOU COVER THE EDGE. THAT'S VERY INTERESTING.  I COVER THE EDGE SO THEN IT  BECOMES ALL OF ONE PIECE. YEAH, YOU CAN'T  SEE THE EDGE.  YOU DON'T SEE  HOW IT WAS PUT TOGETHER. I REALLY DON'T  LIKE THAT. MM-HMM. YEAH, AND THE EDGE--BUT THE EDGE  ACTUALLY MAKES IT A SHARP EDGE. EXACTLY. WHAT KIND OF BRUSH IS THIS? THIS IS A REAL ARTIST BRUSH.  IT'S A NUMBER 12... YEAH. AND, UM, IT'S KIND OF  THE PERFECT SIZE FOR MOST COOKIES,  'CAUSE IT'S GOT A NICE POINT. YOU CAN GET INTO  DETAIL SPOTS. HOW'S THAT?  YOU MISSED A LITTLE  SPOT RIGHT THERE. I MISSED A LITTLE SPOT?  A LITTLE SPOT. THERE YOU GO. PERFECT.  SO HOW LONG DO THESE HAVE TO SIT? WELL, FOR THEM TO BE  PERFECTLY HARD, I WOULD LET THEM  SIT OVERNIGHT. WELL, FORTUNATELY I'M IMPATIENT, SO PATTI'S BROUGHT SOME COOKIES THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING  OVERNIGHT...  EXACTLY. SO WE CAN DECORATE THEM, RIGHT? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS PART. OKAY, THIS PART  IS GONNA SCARE ME. SOMETHING TELLS ME MINE'S GONNA  LOOK LIKE A DOG'S DINNER, AND YOURS IS GONNA  LOOK LIKE ART. OH, NO, NO.  OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT? OKAY, WE'RE GONNA MAKE THE BLACK ICING...  BLACK ICING--THAT'S  QUITE A CONCEPT. FOR OUTLINING THE--  OKAY. SO WE START WITH THE WHITE...  YEAH. AND WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT  A LITTLE STIR, AND THEN WE'RE GONNA ADD THE BLACK FOOD COLORING. OH, THIS IS TO OUTLINE  THE COOKIE SO IT GIVES IT MORE POP  WHEN YOU SEE IT. OH, THAT'S-- EXACTLY. IT'LL REALLY POP... THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING. AND BE CRISP AND FUN. STIR IT UP.  WOW, LOOK AT THIS.  IT LOOKS LIKE HALLOWEEN. SO THIS IS  THE CONSISTENCY OF THE OUTLINE, NOT THE FLOODING. EXACTLY... OKAY, GREAT.  AND I THINK THIS IS PERFECT, SO LET'S FILL OUR TUBES  WITH THE BLACK ICING.  OKAY. WOW. CLOSE THE TOP UP AGAIN AND...  OKAY, I KNOW  HOW TO DO THIS. GET THAT BLACK DOWN THERE.  MM-HMM. OKAY. I'M JUST GONNA TEST MINE OUT HERE. PERFECT. PERFECT. OKAY, WE'RE READY  TO OUTLINE. WE'RE READY TO GO? YEP. OKAY. I'M GONNA START WITH THIS ONE... AND YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA GIVE IT A LITTLE BIT OF A JAGGEDY  LINE TO MAKE IT MORE--  OH, SO IT LOOKS LIKE FUR. EXACTLY, AND JUST--  OH, GOOD. WELL, THAT'S  SAFER FOR ME, TOO. OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC.  SO YOU JUST WANT TO STAY, YOU KNOW, AS CLOSE TO THE EDGE  AS YOU CAN. SO ONCE YOU GET IT  ALL OUTLINED... YEAH. YOU'RE GONNA GET INTO  THE FUN DETAILS.  OKAY. I'M GONNA START  WITH THE EAR, AND I KIND OF CAN SEE  WHERE IT'S GONNA BE BECAUSE THE CUTTER SORT OF TELLS YOU, AND I'M GONNA PUT THE EYE AND A LITTLE BLACK NOSE, AND I THINK I'LL GIVE HIM  A LITTLE TINY SMILE, SO HE'S A LITTLE HAPPY.  OHH, I LOVE YOURS. OKAY, THE EAR-- THE EAR ANYWHERE  AROUND THERE.  OKAY. AND YOU CAN MAKE ANY SIZED EAR YOU WANT. IT CAN BE A--  OH! IT'S A VERY BIG EYE. BUT IT'S WORKING OUT.  I LIKE THE SHAPE.  IT IS? OKAY. YES.  AND HE HAS A NICE SMILE, 'CAUSE WE LIKE  DOGS THAT SMILE. YEAH. YEAH, YOURS IS HAPPIER THAN MINE. MINE'S--MINE'S REALLY HAPPY. AND IF YOU WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE SPOT SOMEWHERE, YOU COULD JUST GO LIKE THAT AND KIND OF--  AND JUST FILL IT IN? YEP.  OH, I LIKE THAT. OKAY. I'M GONNA GIVE HIM ANOTHER LITTLE SPOT HERE. OKAY, THAT LOOKS GREAT.  WHAT'S NEXT?  I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THEM EACH COLLARS. OH, I THINK SO, TOO. OH,  IS THAT WHAT THE RED IS FOR? YES. OKAY, GOOD.  I'M GONNA-- I'M GONNA DO BLUE... OKAY. YOU'LL DO RED. OKAY. SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA START  AT THE EDGE OF THE BLACK AND MAKE A SLIGHTLY  CURVED LINE, AND I'M GONNA ACTUALLY  DOUBLE MY LINE SO HIS COLLAR'S A LITTLE THICKER, AND THERE YOU GO. CUTE.  OH, CAN IT HAVE  A LITTLE HANG TAG ON IT? YEAH, I THOUGHT WE COULD  SWITCH COLORS AND--  OH, GREAT.  OH, FABULOUS. OHH.  IS THAT OKAY? IT'S GREAT.  OH, GREAT! THANK YOU SO MUCH.  I LOVE MY DOG. LOVED YOURS BETTER. THANK YOU, PATTI.  THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN.  THANK YOU. THAT WAS SUCH FUN. PATTI'S LOOKS LIKE A PEDIGREE.  MINE LOOKS LIKE A MUTT... BUT A LOVABLE MUTT. I LOVE MUTTS. I PROMISED  COOKIES ALL THE TIME, AND I'M STICKING TO MY PLEDGE WITH ALL YOUR SMART COOKIE  QUESTIONS IN "ASK INA." SO IT'S MY FAVORITE TIME OF DAY.  IT'S "ASK INA," AND IT'S MY FAVORITE  SUBJECT--COOKIES. OKAY, WHO'S FIRST? Hi, Ina.  I really love your show. I noticed that when  you're baking cookies, that you'll put two  cookie sheets in the oven at the same time, and I was  wondering if you had good luck with them coming out evenly.  Thanks for your help. THAT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD  QUESTION. THIS IS WHAT I DO. THE IDEAL PLACE  TO BAKE COOKIES IN THE OVEN IS RIGHT IN THE CENTER, SO THE AIR CAN CIRCULATE  REALLY WELL. ABOUT HALFWAY  THROUGH THE COOKING TIME, I'LL ROTATE THE PAN,  BECAUSE THE BACK OF THE OVEN IS VERY OFTEN  HOTTER THAN THE FRONT, AND THIS WAY  THEY'LL COOK EVENLY. BUT IF YOU'RE COOKING  MORE THAN ONE PAN OF COOKIES-- AND I DO IT A LOT--  I'LL ADJUST THE RACKS SO THEY'RE REALLY  EVENLY SPACED IN THE OVEN, AND DON'T OVERCROWD IT. YOU WANT TO BE SURE  THAT THE HEAT CAN CIRCULATE. AND THEN I'LL NOT ONLY ROTATE  THE PANS FROM FRONT TO BACK, BUT I'LL SWITCH THE TOP ONE  AND THE BOTTOM ONE, AND THAT WAY YOU'LL GET EVENLY  BAKED COOKIES EVERY TIME. IF YOU'RE OVEN'S REALLY FULL, IT MAY TAKE A FEW MORE MINUTES  TO BAKE THE COOKIES. ALL THIS TALK ABOUT COOKIES  IS MAKING ME HUNGRY. OKAY, WHAT'S NEXT?  THIS IS FROM BARBARA MILLER. "DEAR INA, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE  THE SHORTBREAD HEART COOKIES "FROM YOUR BOOK. WHAT'S  THE RECIPE FOR THE CHOCOLATE THE COOKIES ARE DIPPED IN,  AND HOW DO YOU MAKE IT?" THIS I'M GONNA HAVE TO SHOW YOU.  COME WITH ME. SO THIS IS CHOCOLATE GANACHE, AND WHAT I'VE DONE IS  I'VE MELTED TOGETHER 1/2 A POUND  OF SEMISWEET CHOCOLATE, 1/2 A CUP OF HEAVY CREAM, AND A TEASPOON  OF INSTANT COFFEE-- IT'S ACTUALLY  NOT COFFEE GRANULES, IT'S ACTUALLY INSTANT COFFEE-- JUST UNTIL IT'S JUST MELTED,  AND THEN TURN THE HEAT OFF. IT'S OVER A PAN  OF SIMMERING WATER. JUST SO IT'S JUST SORT OF  FLOWING LIKE THAT, AND THEN I'LL TAKE COOKIES--  THESE ARE THE HEART-SHAPED COOKIES  THAT YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT-- AND ACTUALLY WHAT I DO IS,  INSTEAD OF DIPPING IT, I JUST DRIZZLE IT  RIGHT DOWN THE FRONT OF IT. THE THING ABOUT THIS GANACHE  IS IT NEVER REALLY GETS HARD, AND SO WHAT I DO IS I LET IT  GET A LITTLE FIRMER. I PUT IT ON A MUFFIN CUP  AND LET IT JUST SIT THERE, AND I JUST SERVE IT  RIGHT ON THAT MUFFIN CUP. NOW IF YOU WANT HARD CHOCOLATE  ON A COOKIE, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO  IS TEMPER IT, WHICH IS A HUGE, LONG PROCESS,  AND IT'S VERY DELICATE, SO THAT'S WHY  I ACTUALLY DO GANACHE. IT'S SO MUCH EASIER, AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS... AND I THINK IT'S  THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. OKAY, TIME FOR  ONE MORE QUESTION. THIS IS AN E-MAIL  FROM RORY ROSS. "HI, INA. I LOVE YOUR SHOW."  THANK YOU, RORY. "I WAS WONDERING HOW TO MAKE  ICE CREAM SANDWICHES." WELL, YOU KNOW, COMMERCIALLY  MADE ICE CREAM SANDWICHES CAN BE REALLY BORING, BUT WHEN YOU MAKE THEM YOURSELF, THEY CAN BE AMAZING.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW I DO IT. TAKE TWO COOKIES--I'M USING  MY CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES, BUT YOU CAN USE ANY HOMEMADE OR STORE-BOUGHT COOKIES  THAT YOU LOVE-- PUT A SCOOP OF SOFTENED ICE  CREAM ON ONE OF THE COOKIES-- I LIKE TO USE COFFEE ICE CREAM-- THEN PUT THE OTHER COOKIE ON TOP  AND SMUSH IT TOGETHER, AND VOILà, YOU'VE GOT  AN ICE CREAM SANDWICH. IT JUST NEEDS TO GO INTO  THE FREEZER FOR A FEW MINUTES FOR IT TO HARDEN UP. NOW HOW EASY WAS THAT? TWO MINUTES, AND YOU'VE GOT A DELICIOUS ICE CREAM SANDWICH. HMM. I THINK THIS ONE  MIGHT HAVE MY NAME ON IT. HAVE FUN. Closed Captions provided by  Scripps Networks, LLC.
