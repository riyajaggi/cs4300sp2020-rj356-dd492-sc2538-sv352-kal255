IT'S JUST TOO EXHAUSTING. I'VE INVITED FRIENDS FOR DINNER  TWO NIGHTS IN A ROW, SO I'M MAKING A PLAN. I'M GONNA MAKE  THE FIRST DINNER IN ADVANCE. I'M MAKING A LOIN OF PORK  WITH FENNEL STUFFING-- IT'S SO DELICIOUS-- AND FOR EVERYONE WHO THINKS  THEY DON'T LIKE VEGETABLES,

 A CAULIFLOWER GRATIN THAT'S  SURPRISINGLY OUT OF THIS WORLD, AND CRISP  GREEN GREEN VEGETABLES SAUTéED WITH LOTS OF SHALLOTS, AND FOR A DECADENT FINISH,  PUMPKIN MOUSSE PARFAITS-- CREAMY LAYERS OF PUMPKIN  AND WHIPPED CREAM WITH SPICY GINGER COOKIES  IN BETWEEN. IT'S A PARTY  THAT'S A HOLIDAY CELEBRATION, BUT IT'S GREAT FOR A CELEBRATION  ANYTIME OF THE YEAR. WHEN I'M ENTERTAINING, I HAVE  A FEW REALLY IMPORTANT RULES. ONE OF THEM IS  ALWAYS SERVE COCKTAILS. BUT THE SECOND ONE IS... I ALWAYS TRY AND MAKE THINGS  THAT I CAN MAKE IN ADVANCE, SO I CAN PREPARE THEM,  REFRIGERATE THEM AND THEN JUST THROW THEM  IN THE OVEN BEFORE DINNER.

 IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND VEGETABLES  THAT YOU CAN MAKE IN ADVANCE, BUT GRATINS ARE TERRIFIC...  POTATO GRATIN. I LIKE TO MAKE ZUCCHINI GRATIN. BUT FOR THIS DINNER, I'M GONNA  MAKE CAULIFLOWER GRATIN. SO I'VE GOT  A 3-POUND CAULIFLOWER. I'M JUST GONNA CUT IT UP  INTO FLORETS. OKAY... A BIG POT  OF BOILING, SALTED WATER... THAT'S JUST GONNA BOIL  FOR ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MINUTES UNTIL THE CAULIFLOWER  IS JUST TENDER. IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GONNA MAKE  A DELICIOUS WHITE SAUCE. AND THE FIRST THING I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO HEAT UP  2 CUPS OF MILK. IN THE MEANTIME,  I'M GONNA GRATE SOME CHEESE. I NEED ABOUT 3/4 CUP OF GRUYèRE. ABOUT 1/2 OF THE CUP  IS GONNA GO INTO THE SAUCE, AND THEN I'M GONNA  PUT SOME ON TOP. IT'S GET ALL BROWN  AND DELICIOUS. OKAY... SO ABOUT 2 TABLESPOONS  OF BUTTER... OKAY, 3 TABLESPOONS OF FLOUR ALL AT ONCE. SO I'M JUST GONNA COOK THE FLOUR  AND THE BUTTER TOGETHER. IT ACTUALLY BECOMES  LIKE A PASTE. I'M JUST GONNA  POUR THE MILK RIGHT IN. WHOA... REALLY HOT. AND THEN JUST STIR THIS,  AND YOU'LL SEE IT REALLY THICKENS UP, SO IT'S A REALLY GOOD  WHITE SAUCE. OH, IT'S REALLY  NICE AND SMOOTH NOW. ACTUALLY, YOU CAN SEE  IT REALLY COATS THE BACK OF THE SPOON NICELY.  OKAY, IT'S THICK ENOUGH. I'M JUST GONNA TURN OFF THE HEAT  AND ADD SOME GREAT FLAVOR. FIRST IS SALT. I NEED A TEASPOON  OF KOSHER SALT... 1/2 TEASPOON OF PEPPER. AND THE NEXT THING IS  A REALLY CLASSIC FRENCH SPICE, SO 1/4 TEASPOON  OF GROUND NUTMEG, AND THEN LOTS  OF DELICIOUS GRUYèRE CHEESE-- ABOUT 1/2 CUP.  AND I ADD PARMESAN. IT'S NOT SO CLASSIC  FOR FRENCH GRATINS, BUT IT GIVES IT  A NICE NUTTY FLAVOR. ABOUT 1/2 CUP  OF GRATED PARMESAN. AND THEN JUST STIR IT TOGETHER.  OH, IT SMELLS SO GOOD. YOU CAN REALLY SMELL  THE NUTTINESS OF THE GRUYèRE AND THE SPICY PARMESAN  AND EVEN THE NUTMEG. OKAY, THAT'S DONE. I THINK  THE CAULIFLOWER IS READY. A NICE STEAM BATH. AND THIS IS THE GRATIN DISH  I'M GONNA USE. IT'S ABOUT 8x11, BUT IT  DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACT. SO THE FIRST THING I'M GONNA DO IS PUT ABOUT A THIRD  OF THE SAUCE IN THE BOTTOM... IT EVEN LOOKS LIKE IT HAS A LOT  OF FLAVOR, DOESN'T IT? AND THEN THE CAULIFLOWER... AND THEN THE REST OF THE SAUCE. THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS  GOOD ALREADY, BUT I'M GONNA MAKE  A NICE CRUMB TOPPING, SO IT GETS BROWN AND CRUSTY.  IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD. OKAY, SO I NEED  A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER. SO IT'S 1/4 CUP OF BREADCRUMBS, 1/4 CUP OF GRUYèRE. I'M JUST GONNA  MIX THIS TOGETHER, AND I'M JUST GONNA  SPRINKLE IT OVER THE TOP... AND THEN JUST DRIZZLE IT  WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BUTTER. IT NEVER HURT ANYTHING. I'M JUST GONNA LEAVE THAT  TO ROOM TEMPERATURE, THEN I'M GONNA  REFRIGERATE IT AND BAKE IT JUST BEFORE THE PARTY. THAT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. OKAY, SO THE NEXT VEGETABLE  I'M GONNA MAKE-- IT'S ALSO GREAT  TO MAKE IN ADVANCE. I CALL IT  GREEN GREEN SPRING VEGETABLES. SO THE FIRST THING  I'M GONNA DO IS CUT OFF THE ENDS OF THE ASPARAGUS AND JUST CUT THEM ON A DIAGONAL. THE ENDS ARE PRETTY HARD,  SO YOU DON'T WANT TO EAT THOSE. THEN I'M GONNA PUT IT  IN THE BOILING WATER AND BLANCH THEM REALLY QUICKLY.  YOU WANT THEM CRISP-TENDER. THE NEXT THING I'M GONNA DO IS  FRENCH STRING BEANS. THESE ARE CALLED HARICOTS VERTS. I'M GONNA DO  MAYBE 1/4 OR 1/2 POUND OF EACH VEGETABLE. IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER. THEN JUST CUT OFF THE ENDS  OF THE STRING BEANS. AND BY NOW, THE ASPARAGUS  SHOULD BE DONE. THIS IS A GREAT THING.  IT'S A CHINESE STRAINER, AND IT'S GREAT  FOR LIFTING VEGETABLES OUT OF HOT WATER. I'M JUST GONNA PUT THEM  IN ICE WATER TO SET THE COLOR AND STOP THE COOKING. YOU WANT THEM A LITTLE TENDER  BUT NOT COMPLETELY DONE. OKAY, THEN THE STRING BEANS  GO IN THE SAME WATER. AND THE NEXT THING  I HAVE IS BROCCOLINI. NOW I FIND IT  REALLY TENDER AND DELICIOUS. OKAY, STRING BEANS ARE DONE. IT HAPPENS FAST. RIGHT INTO THE SAME ICE WATER... AND THEN THE BROCCOLINI. AND THE LAST VEGETABLE  IS SUGAR SNAP PEAS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THEY ALREADY  COME WITH THE END SNAPPED, SO YOU DON'T HAVE  TO DO IT YOURSELF. OKAY, BROCCOLINI IS REALLY FAST. IT'S DONE. RIGHT INTO THE SAME ICE WATER... AND IN GO THE SUGAR SNAP PEAS. JUST ABOUT 60 SECONDS... PERFECT. I'M GONNA DRAIN THESE. I'M GONNA PUT THEM  IN THE REFRIGERATOR, AND THEY'LL BE READY  TO SAUTé WITH SHALLOTS. BUT ENOUGH WITH THE VEGETABLES. IT'S TIME  FOR PUMPKIN MOUSSE PARFAIT. THIS IS SO WONDERFUL. IT'S A PARFAIT IN A TALL GLASS. AND IT'S GOT PUMPKIN MOUSSE  AND LAYERS OF WHIPPED CREAM AND CRUMBLED COOKIES.  IT'S JUST DELICIOUS. BUT THE FIRST THING  YOU NEED, THOUGH, IS 1/4 CUP OF GOOD DARK RUM. I LOVE THIS. IT JUST SMELLS  LIKE THE CARIBBEAN TO ME. AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS DISSOLVE ONE PACKET OF GELATIN RIGHT INTO THE RUM. I'M JUST GONNA  LET THAT SOAK FOR A MINUTE, AND THEN I'M GONNA HEAT IT UP  AND ADD IT BACK IN. SO THE FIRST THING I NEED  IS ONE CAN OF PUMPKIN. YOU CAN MAKE IT  FROM A REAL PUMPKIN, OR YOU CAN USE THIS.  THIS ACTUALLY TASTES BETTER. PUMPKIN CAN BE REALLY STRINGY. AND RIGHT OUT OF THE CAN,  IT'S JUST DELICIOUS. SO IT'S A 15-OUNCE CAN  OF PUMPKIN PURéE. AND I NEED 1/2 CUP  OF REGULAR SUGAR... 1/2 CUP OF LIGHT BROWN SUGAR. JUST LIGHTLY PACKED  IS THE WAY IT'S MEASURED. OKAY, THAT'S IT, 1/2 CUP OF LIGHT BROWN SUGAR. I NEED TWO EGG YOLKS. AND NOW TO GET  LOTS OF GOOD FLAVOR, I'M GONNA PUT IN  2 TEASPOONS OF ORANGE ZEST. PUT THAT RIGHT IN. I NEED 1/2 TEASPOON OF CINNAMON, 1/2 TEASPOON OF SALT, 1/4 TEASPOON OF NUTMEG. I'M JUST GONNA  STIR IT ALL TOGETHER. MMM. THIS ALREADY SMELLS GOOD. I LOVE THE ORANGE  AND CINNAMON TOGETHER. AND IT LOOKS--A GORGEOUS COLOR. OKAY, NOW TO MAKE  A MOUSSE OUT OF IT, I'M GONNA TAKE THE GELATIN,  AND I'M GONNA HEAT IT UP AND THEN ADD IT BACK IN. SO YOU'LL SEE  THAT IT'S A LITTLE LUMPY WHEN IT'S SOFTENED, BUT WHEN IT'S DISSOLVED  WITH HEAT, IT'S REALLY LIQUID-Y,  SO THAT'S PERFECT. OKAY, SO I'M  JUST GONNA POUR THIS RIGHT INTO THE PUMPKIN MIXTURE. IT'S SUCH A GREAT--I CAN SMELL  THE RUM WHEN IT GETS HOT. AND WHAT THIS IS GONNA DO IS  WHEN IT'S REFRIGERATED, THE PUMPKIN MOUSSE IS GONNA SET. JUST MIX IT IN. PERFECT. OKAY, SO I NEED 1 1/2 CUPS  OF HEAVY CREAM-- YOU WANT IT TO BE COLD  BEFORE YOU START, 'CAUSE IT'LL WHIP BETTER-- A SPLASH OF VANILLA. JUST WHIP IT ON HIGH  UNTIL IT'S REALLY LIGHT. IF YOU OVERWHIP IT, THOUGH,  YOU'LL END UP WITH BUTTER, SO BE CAREFUL AT THE END. PERFECT. SO I'M JUST GONNA TAKE  THIS WHIPPED CREAM AND FOLD IT  INTO THE PUMPKIN MIXTURE. AND THAT'S GONNA  REALLY LIGHTEN IT AND MAKE IT SORT OF,  LIKE, MOUSSE-Y. OKAY. NOW THE BEST WAY  TO FOLD SOMETHING IN IS TO PUT YOUR SPATULA  THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND THEN FOLD IT OVER AND THEN TURN THE BOWL  AND FOLD IT OVER. AND THAT WAY YOU DON'T  DEFLATE THE CREAM, AND YOU GET REALLY LIGHT MOUSSE. SO THEN WHAT I WANT TO DO  IS I WANT TO LAYER THE PUMPKIN MOUSSE,  WHIPPED CREAM AND COOKIES, GINGER COOKIES. SO THE NEXT THING I NEED TO DO  IS MAKE MORE WHIPPED CREAM, BUT THIS TIME I WANT TO MAKE  SWEETENED WHIPPED CREAM. SO I'M GONNA HAVE  1 CUP OF CREAM-- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACT-- 1 TABLESPOON OF SUGAR  AND 1 TEASPOON OF VANILLA. I LOVE GOOD VANILLA. I'M JUST GONNA WHIP THAT UP. OKAY, AND THEN I HAVE GLASSES. SO THIS IS WHAT  I'M GONNA PUT THE MOUSSE IN. SO, AGAIN, I DON'T WANT  TO OVERWHIP IT. OTHERWISE,  I'LL END UP WITH BUTTER. I'VE ACTUALLY FOUND  IF YOU USE A PASTRY BAG, IT'S CLEANER. IT'S NEATER. SO I WANT TO PUT  THE MOUSSE IN THE BAG. IF YOU HAVE A PASTRY BAG  WITH A ROUND TIP, JUST A PLAIN ROUND TIP,  OR EVEN ANY KIND OF A BIG TIP, I'LL SHOW YOU  HOW QUICKLY IT GOES. JUST PUT ABOUT A THIRD  IN THE BOTTOM. OKAY, SO THAT'S  THE FIRST LAYER OF MOUSSE... THEN A LITTLE LAYER  OF WHIPPED CREAM. NOW BECAUSE I LOVE THINGS THAT HAVE DIFFERENT TEXTURES-- SO THE MOUSSE IS CREAMY.  THE WHIPPED CREAM IS SWEET. I'M GONNA HAVE  SOME CRUMBLED GINGER COOKIES. SO WHEN YOU BITE INTO IT, YOU GET SOMETHING THAT'S CREAMY, SOMETHING THAT'S SMOOTH  AND SOMETHING THAT'S CRUNCHY. AND IT LOOKS GREAT, TOO,  DOESN'T IT? NOW ANOTHER LAYER OF PUMPKIN... NOW ANOTHER LAYER  OF WHIPPED CREAM, JUST A LITTLE BIT  ON TOP OF EACH ONE... A LITTLE MORE GINGER COOKIE... THE LAST LAYER OF PUMPKIN-- WELL, THAT WORKED OUT  PERFECTLY... OKAY, A LITTLE DOLLOP  OF WHIPPED CREAM... AND JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS  EXACTLY WHAT'S IN IT, A LITTLE GINGER COOKIE  DECORATION ON THE TOP. AND DOESN'T THAT  LOOK LIKE A PARTY? I'M JUST GONNA REFRIGERATE THAT. THEN I'M GONNA MAKE LOIN OF PORK  WITH FENNEL STUFFING. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY GOOD. SO I WANT TO MAKE  A SPECIAL MEAL, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN  IT HAS TO BE COMPLICATED. SO FOR THE MAIN COURSE,  I'M GONNA MAKE LOIN OF PORK AND STUFF IT WITH FENNEL.  I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO MAKE IT. SO I'VE CUT UP  ABOUT 2 CUPS OF ONIONS, JUST A ROUGH CHOP. OKAY, NOW I NEED  2 CUPS OF SLICED FENNEL. I'M JUST GONNA  TAKE OUT THE CORE. MMM. I LOVE  THE ANISE FLAVOR OF THIS. I CAN ALREADY SMELL IT.  IT'S WONDERFUL. AND THEN JUST SLICE IT THINLY. SO THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT 2 CUPS. I'M JUST GONNA LET THIS COOK  FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES UNTIL THE ONIONS  AND FENNEL ARE TENDER, AND THEN THE FENNEL  GETS REALLY SWEET. IT'S A WONDERFUL FLAVOR. IN THE MEANTIME,  I'M GONNA GET SOME GARLIC READY AND FRESH THYME, GIVE IT LOTS OF FLAVOR.  SO I'M GONNA CHOP THE GARLIC. NOW THE THING ABOUT GARLIC  IS I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT IN TOO EARLY,  'CAUSE IT BURNS REALLY QUICKLY. SO JUST LET THE ONIONS  AND FENNEL COOK AND THEN PUT THE GARLIC IN AT THE LAST MINUTE. JUST A ROUGH CHOP. AND THEN FRESH THYME. I REALLY PREFER TO USE  FRESH HERBS WHEN YOU CAN. ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE HOW THE ONIONS AND FENNEL ARE DOING. JUST TOSS THEM. YOU DON'T WANT THEM  TO BROWN TOO MUCH. OH, THIS IS BEGINNING  TO LOOK GOOD. I JUST WANT TO ADD THE GARLIC. ADD THE FRESH THYME, AND JUST CHOP IT UP A SMIDGE. JUST RELEASE ALL THE OIL  FROM THE THYME. A TEASPOON OF SALT... 1/2 TEASPOON OF PEPPER. OKAY, NOW I'M JUST GONNA ADD  A LITTLE BIT OF WINE. AND WHAT THAT'S GONNA DO  IS DEGLAZE THE PAN. IT'S GONNA SCRAPE UP  ALL THOSE BROWNED BITS THAT HAVE LOTS OF FLAVOR. MMM. THIS LOOKS GREAT.  IT SMELLS EVEN BETTER. OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA TURN  THE HEAT OFF AND LET THAT SIT. IT'LL COOL OFF WHILE I MAKE  FRESH BREADCRUMBS. SO FRESH BREADCRUMBS-- I'M JUST GONNA TAKE WHITE BREAD, CUT OFF THE CRUSTS, AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA DICE IT. IT'S GONNA BE NICE, FLUFFY. BREADCRUMBS. I NEED ABOUT 3 CUPS  OF FRESH BREADCRUMBS. OKAY, NOW I'M GONNA  UNROLL THE PORK. SO WHAT I'VE ASKED THE BUTCHER  TO DO IS TO BUTTERFLY IT LIKE A LETTER  SO IT'S IN THREE PARTS, AND IT'S GONNA OPEN LIKE THAT. SO JUST SEE... LET'S SEE.  YEAH, THAT'S PERFECT. OKAY, I'M GONNA SALT  AND PEPPER IT. SEASON IT WELL, BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE  IT HAS LOTS OF FLAVOR. NOW FRESH PEPPER. SO NOW I WANT TO PUT  THE BREADCRUMBS INTO THE STUFFING, SO ABOUT 3 CUPS  OF FRESH BREADCRUMBS INTO THE COOLED FENNEL  AND ONIONS. AND THAT'S GONNA REALLY BIND IT  AND HOLD IT TOGETHER, SO WHEN THE LOIN OF PORK  IS SLICED, THE STUFFING WON'T FALL OUT. OKAY, SO IT'S NICE AND COOL NOW. I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT  RIGHT ON TOP OF THE LOIN OF PORK. IF I'M GONNA  BAKE THIS RIGHT AWAY, IT DOESN'T MATTER  WHETHER THE FILLING IS COOLED. BUT SINCE I'M GONNA PUT IT  IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND BAKE IT ANOTHER DAY,  I WANT TO BE SURE, KIND OF LIKE  THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY, THAT THE STUFFING  IS REALLY COOL. AND I'M GONNA ROLL IT UP  LIKE A JELLY ROLL... JUST LIKE THAT. AND YOU WANT TO END FAT SIDE UP LIKE THAT. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT. OKAY, NOW I'M JUST GONNA  TIE IT UP WITH BUTCHER STRING. YOU CAN FIND THIS  IN ANY COOKWARE STORE. THERE ARE ALL KINDS  OF FANCY WAYS TO TIE THIS, BUT JUST A KNOT AT THE TOP  IS TOTALLY FINE, 'CAUSE I'M GONNA TAKE IT OFF  BEFORE I SERVE IT ANYWAY. AND WHAT THIS IS GONNA DO IS KEEP THE LOIN OF PORK  IN A REALLY NICE SHAPE. IT'LL KEEP IT NICE AND ROUND  AND KEEP THE STUFFING IN. AND THAT WAY,  ALSO, IT COOKS EVENLY. OKAY, NOW I'M JUST GONNA  RUB THE TOP OF THIS WITH A LITTLE OLIVE OIL. OOPS. HOW ABOUT  A LOT OF OLIVE OIL? SPRINKLE IT  WITH SALT AND PEPPER. NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE  IT'S GONNA BE DELICIOUS. PUT IT ON A SHEET PAN. OKAY, INTO THE FRIDGE, AND IT'S GONNA BE ALL READY  TO GO INTO THE OVEN FOR MY DINNER PARTY  TOMORROW NIGHT. WHAT A DAY... LOTS OF SHOPPING. THE GOOD NEWS IS DINNER'S READY.  IT'S IN THE FRIDGE. I'M GONNA PUT IT IN THE OVEN, SAUTé A FEW VEGETABLES  AND DINNER IS DONE. OKAY, THAT'S GONNA ROAST  425 DEGREES FOR ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES, AND THEN I'M GONNA  LOWER THE TEMPERATURE TO 350, AND IT'S GONNA GO  FOR ABOUT 20 TO 30 MINUTES UNTIL IT'S EXACTLY 137 DEGREES. THE CAULIFLOWER GRATIN...  I'M GONNA BAKE AT 375 FOR ABOUT 25 TO 30 MINUTES. AND YOU KNOW, GRATINS  AREN'T THAT SENSITIVE. IF YOU ONLY HAVE ONE OVEN, PUT IT IN WITH THE LOIN OF PORK. SAME TIME EVERY YEAR,  HOW'S THAT? FOR 38 YEARS. AND I GOT TO SAY, THAT'S HARDER  THAN DOING A DINNER PARTY. OKAY, YOU GUYS DRINK  MORE CHAMPAGNE. FRANK, WANT TO HELP ME  WITH DINNER? YES, INDEED. OKAY, WE'LL  BE RIGHT BACK. SO I'M JUST GONNA CHOP UP  THREE SHALLOTS. HOW YOU DOING OVER THERE? THE STRING IS DONE, BUT I NEED YOU TO SHOW ME  HOW YOU WANT IT CARVED. YEAH.  OH, I CAN DO THAT.  SO I'LL SHOW YOU-- I'LL DO ONE OR TWO,  HOW'S THAT? THAT'S PERFECT. SO THE KNIFE  SHOULD BE PRETTY SHARP. WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS USE  THE BLADE BACK AND FORTH. SEE THE FENNEL FILLING?  HOW'S THAT? YEAH. I PROBABLY WOULDN'T  DO IT TOO THIN, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT  THE FILLING TO FALL OUT. THAT WORK FOR YOU? THAT LOOKS VERY EASY. THAT'S JUST THE WAY I WAS GONNA DO IT. OKAY, BACK  TO THE VEGETABLES. SO I HAVE THE OIL  AND THE BUTTER ALL MELTED. I'M GONNA PUT IN THREE SHALLOTS  THAT I'VE CHOPPED UP. THIS IS A GREAT WAY  TO MAKE VEGETABLES WHEN YOU HAVE COMPANY  BECAUSE ALL I'M DOING IS GONNA REHEAT THEM  WITH THE SHALLOTS. IT'S REALLY FAST. OKAY, I'M DONE.  HOW ARE YOU DOING OVER THERE? I AM DONE. IT LOOKS PERFECT.  YOU'RE DONE? YES.  OKAY, I'M PUTTING  THE VEGETABLES IN THE DISH. HOW'S THAT LOOK  WITH ALL THE SHALLOTS? IS THAT THYME?  IT SMELLS SO GOOD,  DOESN'T IT? IT SMELLS DELICIOUS.  IT SURE DOES.  IT SMELLS GREAT. YOU CAN REALLY SMELL  THE FENNEL, CAN'T YOU? IT LOOKS GREAT. A LITTLE PARSLEY  ALWAYS HELPS, RIGHT? IT LOOKS GOOD.
