  I'M THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA, AND I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE  ABOUT THE PERFECT BRUNCH. (Ina) HERE'S THE MENU--  ROASTED HAZELNUT GRANOLA, A FRUIT PLATTER WITH  RIPE MELONS AND FRESH BERRIES, A BASKET OF CROISSANTS WITH MY HOMEMADE  APRICOT BUTTER, AND THE EASIEST BAKED BLINTZES  YOU EVER MADE WITH FRESH BLUEBERRY SAUCE. BUT I'M NOT DOING THIS ALONE.  I'VE CALLED IN THE "A" TEAM. MY FRIEND MIGUEL FLORES-VIANNA  IS DOING THE TABLE SETTING AND TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS,

 AND MY FRIEND MICHAEL GRIM  IS ON THE FLOWERS. THIS IS THE PERFECT BRUNCH  MADE EASY. ♪♪ I'M DOING AN ARTICLE  ABOUT BRUNCH. IT'S NO SECRET THAT I LOVE  ENTERTAINING DURING THE DAY. I LOVE BREAKFAST, LUNCH,  BRUNCH--ANY OF THEM. PEOPLE COME FOR A FEW HOURS,  WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD TIME, THEY HAVE LOTS OF ENERGY, AND THEN THEY GO OFF  TO THE REST OF THEIR DAY. IT'S A WONDERFUL WAY TO ENTERTAIN, AND I LOVE THE FOOD. I'M STARTING WITH  ROASTED HAZELNUT GRANOLA. I LOVE MAKING GRANOLA. YOU CAN MAKE IT WAY IN ADVANCE. IT'S DELICIOUS  FOR BREAKFAST OR BRUNCH, AND YOU CAN MAKE SO MANY  DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF IT.

 SO I'M STARTING WITH 1 CUP  OF ROASTED HAZELNUTS, JUST REALLY COARSELY CHOPPED. NEXT IS 1 CUP  OF ROASTED CASHEWS. ACTUALLY, EVEN THOUGH  I'M ROASTING THESE, I START WITH ROASTED NUTS. THE WONDERFUL THING IS,  WHEN YOU ROAST THEM, THE FLAVOR OF THE NUTS  REALLY COMES OUT. AND JUST ALSO GIVE IT  A BIG ROUGH CHOP. YOU DON'T WANT LITTLE PIECES.  YOU WANT BIG PIECES. OKAY, INTO THE BOWL. NEXT IS 1 CUP OF OATMEAL. CAN'T MAKE GRANOLA  WITHOUT OATMEAL. I LIKE THE CRUNCH  OF THE OLD-FASHIONED ONES. NEXT IS 1/2 A CUP  OF SLIVERED ALMONDS. YOU COULD ALSO USE SLICED ALMONDS, BUT THESE ARE SLIVERED. 1/2 A CUP OF SWEETENED  SHREDDED COCONUT. ALL OF THESE MEASUREMENTS  AREN'T EXACT. IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING  MORE THAN SOMETHING ELSE, JUST ADD A LITTLE MORE. 3 TABLESPOONS OF VEGETABLE OIL. THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA  BROWN EVERYTHING AND MAKE IT TASTE SO DELICIOUS. YOU WANT A FLAVORLESS OIL. 2 TABLESPOONS OF HONEY, AND IF YOU DO THE OIL FIRST, THE HONEY COMES OUT  OF THE TABLESPOON EASILY. THAT'S A NEAT LITTLE TRICK. AGAIN, PUT AS MUCH HONEY IN  AS YOU LIKE. GIVE IT ALL A BIG STIR. THIS LOOKS GOOD AND HEALTHY. THE NICE THING ABOUT GRANOLA IS YOU CAN REALLY MAKE IT  WELL IN ADVANCE, ROAST THE WHOLE THING, AND JUST KEEP IT  IN AN AIRTIGHT CONTAINER. I'M NOT DOING THIS BRUNCH ALONE. I'VE GOT PARTNERS IN CRIME. MY FRIEND MIGUEL  IS DOING THE TABLE AND I GAVE HIM BLUE AND WHITE  CLOTHS TO WORK WITH, AND MY FRIEND MICHAEL  IS DOING THE FLOWERS. I'M SURE  IT'S GONNA BE FANTASTIC. ♪♪ SO THE ONLY REAL INSPIRATION  I HAVE FOR INA'S TABLE IS BLUE. SO MAYBE I SHOULD DO  THE BLUE MUSCARI. YES. THEY'RE LOW, THEY'RE BLUE,  AND THEY'RE NOT SO FORMAL, WHICH I THINK IS PERFECT  FOR BRUNCH. INA ASKED ME TO USE  THESE TWO TABLECLOTHS, A WHITE AND A BLUE ONE. I DECIDED TO USE THE WHITE  AS THE BASE AND THEN, AS AN ACCENT, PUT THE BLUE ONE AS A RUNNER. FOR TEXTURES,  I'M USING THESE RUSH MATS. THEY'RE VERY NICE AND CHUNKY. AND THEY SORT OF CONTRAST WITH THE SOFTNESS OF THE LINEN. GREAT, I HAVE THE FLOWERS. NOW I NEED A VASE. HMM. (clicks tongue) EGGS. WE GOT A PLAN. FOOD LOOKS SO NICE  ON WHITE PLATES, SO I JUST USED  THESE VERY SIMPLE ONES. TO ADD A TOUCH OF WHIMSY, I DECIDED TO USE THESE OVERSIZED TEACUPS INSTEAD OF BOWLS. INA REALLY LIKES IT WHEN WE ADD A TOUCH  OF DIFFERENCE TO HER TABLES. AND AGAIN,  FOR THE COFFEE MUGS, JUST THESE VERY SIMPLE ONES-- WHITE AND CLASSIC. HMM. THIS IS BEGINNING  TO TAKE SHAPE. OKAY, LAST BIG STIR. ONTO A PAN. LOOKS GOOD ALREADY.  IT'S NOT EVEN BAKED. JUST SPREAD IT OUT EVENLY. INTO THE OVEN--350 DEGREES FOR 20 MINUTES. I'M JUST GONNA TOSS IT  A FEW TIMES WHILE IT'S BAKING TO MAKE SURE IT BAKES EVENLY,  AND THAT'S GONNA BE REALLY DELICIOUS  ROASTED HAZELNUT GRANOLA. IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE, MIGUEL'S  AN AMAZING PHOTOGRAPHER, AND HE'S TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS  OF THE TABLE SETTING. IT'S GONNA BE FABULOUS  IN THE ARTICLE. TO ADD HEIGHT, I DECIDED TO USE THESE PITCHERS  FOR THE JUICES. PLUS, THE COLOR OF THE JUICES WILL ADD A LOT OF COLOR  AND SPARK TO THE TABLE. I'VE ALSO CHOSEN TO USE THESE  STRAIGHT-SIDED MODERN GLASSES TO CONTRAST WITH THE ANTIQUE  OF THE OVERSIZED TEACUPS. ♪♪ MMM. THIS GRANOLA  SMELLS SO GOOD. WOW. IT'S REALLY TOASTED AND PERFECT. JUST GIVE IT A TOSS, MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T GET  ALL CLUMPED TOGETHER. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE  GUYS ARE DOING WITH THE TABLE. I'M SURE IT'S FANTASTIC. AND WHEN THE GRANOLA COOLS, I'M GONNA PUT IT IN A BIG BOWL, AND EVERYBODY  CAN HELP THEMSELVES. NEXT, I'M CONJURING UP  A GORGEOUS FRUIT PLATTER, CROISSANT WITH  HOMEMADE APRICOT BUTTER, THEN DELICIOUS BAKED BLINTZES  WITH FRESH BLUEBERRY SAUCE. MY FRIENDS ARE SETTING  THE TABLE AND ARRANGING THE FLOWERS,  AND BRUNCH IS SERVED. MY FRIENDS MICHAEL, MIGUEL,  AND I ARE WORKING TOGETHER-- IT'S ALWAYS NICE  TO WORK WITH FRIENDS-- ON AN ARTICLE  ON THE PERFECT BRUNCH. THEY'RE DOING THE TABLE SETTING,  AND I'M DOING THE FOOD. I'M STARTING  WITH A GOLDEN PINEAPPLE. I THINK THEY'RE REALLY SWEET  AND DELICIOUS. SO I'VE PEELED THE WHOLE THING. I THINK THERE'S AN IDEA  WITH A PINEAPPLE THAT IF YOU CAN PULL OUT  THE LEAF IN THE MIDDLE, THEN IT'S RIPE, BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE. IT MIGHT ACTUALLY MEAN  THAT IT'S ROTTEN, WHICH YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANT. WHEN YOU PICK UP A PINEAPPLE,  SMELL IT. IF IT SMELLS LIKE PINEAPPLE,  IT'S RIPE. SO I THINK I'M JUST GONNA CUT THIS IN HALF AND THEN CUT IT IN QUARTERS. THE ONLY PART OF THIS I DON'T  LIKE TO EAT IS THE CORE. SO I'M JUST GONNA  CUT THE CORE OUT, AND THEN I'LL SLICE IT  RIGHT ON THE PLATTER. SO I'VE GOT PINEAPPLE. I FOUND A RIPE CANTALOUPE  IN THE MARKET. I'VE GOT BERRIES. IT'S GONNA  MAKE A REALLY NICE PLATTER. JUST CUT THE CORE OUT LIKE THIS. THE WHOLE THING ABOUT THIS IS MAKING SURE  IT LOOKS REALLY BOUNTIFUL. OKAY, TIME TO START BUILDING  THE PLATTER. SO I ALWAYS LIKE TO DO  SOMETHING GREEN ON THE PLATE, SO I HAVE SOME FIG LEAVES  OR ANY KIND OF LEAVES. YOU CAN USE LEMON LEAVES OR IF YOU HAVE HYDRANGEAS  IN THE SUMMER-- JUST SOME KIND OF A FLAT LEAF. IT JUST REALLY SETS OFF  THE FRUIT. OKAY. AND THEN THE PINEAPPLE. I THINK I'LL DO THREE PIECES  OF PINEAPPLE AND THEN I'M JUST GONNA CUT IT  RIGHT ON THE PLATE. JUST CUT IT RIGHT ACROSS. AND THEN EVERYBODY  CAN, LIKE, HELP THEMSELVES. CUT IT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE. YOU WANT BIG BLOCKS  OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF FRUIT, BUT YOU DON'T WANT THEM  SCATTERED ALL OVER THE PLATE. YOU WANT THEM ALL TOGETHER,  EACH IN A BLOCK. IT'S MUCH EASIER  TO CUT THIS ON THE PLATE THAN IT IS TO CUT IT  ON THE BOARD AND THEN MOVE  ALL THESE LITTLE PIECES OVER. OKAY, NEXT, CANTALOUPE. AND THEN FOR THE CANTALOUPE, I THINK I'LL JUST DO BIG SLICES. YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE  THERE ARE BIG PIECES OF THINGS SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE  JUST A BOWL OF FRUIT SALAD. AND JUST MOVE ALL THE SLICES OVER AND SPREAD THEM OUT NICELY. AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE. IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO JUST PICK  REALLY RIPE FRUIT. AND THEN ANOTHER ROW. OKAY, JUST FIT ALL THE PIECES  TOGETHER SO IT LOOKS NICE. THAT'S GOOD.  OKAY, NOW SOME FRESH BERRIES. SO THIS, I LIKE TO DO VERY SORT OF "SPILLY,"  VERY ARTISTIC. JUST HAVE IT HAPPEN. JUST PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER. AND THEN THE STRAWBERRIES. YOU WANT BIG BLOCKS OF COLOR. AND LAST, FRESH RASPBERRIES. SO IT LOOKS REALLY COMPLICATED, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY EASY  TO DO. IT'S GONNA LOOK FANTASTIC  ON THE BRUNCH TABLE. SO THAT'S IT  FOR THE FRUIT PLATTER. NEXT, I'M GONNA DO  A BASKET OF CROISSANT. YOU GOTTA HAVE CROISSANT  FOR BRUNCH. SO I'M GONNA SHOW YOU  HOW I LINE A BASKET. THESE ARE ACTUALLY BASKETS  THAT BREAD IS MADE IN, AND I USE THEM  FOR BREAD BASKETS. AND I'M GONNA LINE IT  WITH A LINEN NAPKIN, AND THIS IS HOW I DO IT. I PULL THE CENTER TOGETHER  LIKE THAT AND THEN TURN IT AROUND AND PULL  THE CENTER TOGETHER AGAIN. AND WE END UP WITH THIS-- THE POINTS STICK RIGHT UP. I THINK THAT LOOKS REALLY NICE  FOR A BREAD BASKET. OKAY, AND YOU KNOW THE THING  ABOUT CROISSANT-- YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE THEM  YOURSELF. THEY ARE REALLY GOOD BAKERIES  THAT CAN MAKE THEM. AND WHAT I LOVE TO DO  IS JUST BUY THEM AND HEAT THEM UP  SO THEY'RE NICE AND CRISP. OF COURSE CROISSANT  ARE DELICIOUS WITH BUTTER, BUT THEY'RE EVEN BETTER  WITH APRICOT BUTTER. FLAVORED BUTTERS  ARE SO EASY TO MAKE, AND THEY'RE REALLY DELICIOUS. LET ME TALK YOU THROUGH HOW I MADE THIS APRICOT BUTTER. MAKING FLAVORED BUTTER  IS SO SIMPLE. YOU JUST PUT 1/4 POUND  OF UNSALTED BUTTER AT ROOM TEMPERATURE INTO  THE BOWL OF AN ELECTRIC MIXER, THEN ADD 1/2 A CUP  OF GOOD APRICOT PRESERVES, 1/8 OF A TEASPOON  OF KOSHER SALT-- I KNOW  IT'S AN UNUSUAL INGREDIENT, BUT IT REALLY MAKES  A DIFFERENCE-- AND MIX IT ON LOW SPEED. I MAKE MARMALADE BUTTER,  RASPBERRY BUTTER, HONEY BUTTER. IT'S SO DELICIOUS. THAT'S THE CROISSANT,  GORGEOUS FRUIT PLATTER, APRICOT BUTTER. NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO  IS MAKE THE BLINTZES. MIGUEL AND MICHAEL ARE DOING  THE TABLE SETTING FOR THIS. THEY'RE KEEPING IT A SECRET. ISN'T THAT PRETTY? THIS IS GONNA BE PERFECT  FOR INA'S BRUNCH. THEY'RE REALLY EASY TO DO. YOU JUST TAKE AN EGG,  BREAK THE TOP OFF, FILL IT WITH WATER, ARRANGE THE MUSCARI. AND THEN I WAS WONDERING, WHAT AM I GONNA PUT THESE  LITTLE EGGS IN ON THE TABLE? AND I THOUGHT THE NATURAL THING  IS AN EGG CUP. AREN'T THEY PERFECT? IT'S ALWAYS NICE FOR BRUNCH  TO HAVE SOMETHING HOT, AND I THOUGHT I'D MAKE BLINTZES, WHICH ARE THESE WONDERFUL CREPES THAT ARE FILLED  WITH RICOTTA CHEESE FILLING, AND I'M GONNA MAKE  A BLUEBERRY SAUCE. BUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU--  I DON'T WANT TO STAND AT THE STOVE  MAKING CREPES ONE AT A TIME. I FIGURED OUT A WAY  TO MAKE IT ALL IN ONE PAN AND THEN CUT IT UP. FIRST, I'M GONNA START  WITH THE BATTER. I MAKE IT IN THE FOOD PROCESSOR. IT'S 1 1/4 CUPS OF MILK WITH 2 TABLESPOONS OF SOUR CREAM AND 4 TABLESPOONS  OF MELTED UNSALTED BUTTER, THEN 1 TEASPOON  OF PURE VANILLA EXTRACT, FOUR EXTRA LARGE EGGS, AND NEXT IS 1 1/3 CUPS  OF ALL-PURPOSE FLOUR. AND TO SWEETEN IT,  2 TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR. AND THE LAST INGREDIENT--  1 TABLESPOON OF BAKING POWDER. AND THAT JUST GETS BLENDED  TOGETHER UNTIL IT'S SMOOTH. IT'S FOOLPROOF. SO I HAVE A 9x13 PAN  THAT I'VE GREASED, AND I'M GONNA POUR  HALF THE BATTER IN, AND THAT BECOMES THE BOTTOM  OF THE PANCAKE. IT'S ONE BIG PANCAKE. JUST HALF THE BATTER. YOU CAN MAKE IT IN ADVANCE, OR YOU CAN JUST USE IT  RIGHT AWAY. AND JUST MAKE SURE IT'S EVEN. THIS IS GONNA GO INTO THE OVEN  FOR 10 MINUTES AT 350 DEGREES UNTIL IT'S JUST SET,  AND THAT'S STAGE ONE. NEXT, I'M GOING TO MAKE THE DELICIOUS FILLING  FOR THE BLINTZES AND FRESH BLUEBERRY SAUCE  TO GO ON TOP. AND THEN THE BRUNCH BUNCH  IS MEETING UP IN THE GARDEN ROOM  FOR THE PERFECT BRUNCH. I'M WRITING AN ARTICLE  ABOUT BRUNCH. IT'S A REAL TEAM EFFORT. I'VE GOT MY FRIEND MICHAEL  WORKING ON THE FLOWERS. MY FRIEND MIGUEL IS DOING  THE TABLE SETTING. AND I'M MAKING  BLUEBERRY BLINTZES. THEY'RE SO DELICIOUS.  I'VE GOT THE PANCAKES STARTED, AND NOW WHAT I'M MAKING  IS THE FILLING. AND THE BASIS OF IT  IS RICOTTA CHEESE. I NEED 24 OUNCES. INSTEAD OF MAKING THE CREPES  FOR THE BLINTZES ONE AT A TIME, I'M DOING THEM ALL IN ONE DISH. SO THAT'S 24 OUNCES  OF RICOTTA CHEESE. I NEED 8 OUNCES  OF MASCARPONE. THIS CONTAINER'S 8 3/4 OUNCES,  SO THAT'S FINE. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXACT. TWO EXTRA LARGE EGGS,  JUST LIGHTLY BEATEN. 1/3 OF A CUP OF SUGAR-- IT'S NICE  IF IT'S A LITTLE SWEETER. THIS IS A CLASSIC  EASTERN EUROPEAN DISH. 1 TABLESPOON  OF GRATED LEMON ZEST-- THE FLAVOR IN THIS IS LEMON,  A LITTLE VANILLA. WITH THE RICOTTA  AND THE MASCARPONE, IT'S REALLY CREAMY  AND DELICIOUS, AND THEN THE PANCAKE  ON THE OUTSIDE. AND THEN TO TOP IT ALL OFF, A WARM FRESH BLUEBERRY SAUCE. I MEAN, HOW BAD CAN THAT BE? MIGUEL AND MICHAEL ARE DOING  A TABLE SETTING FOR THIS. THEY'RE KEEPING IT A SECRET. I GAVE THEM A STARTING POINT  OF A BLUE AND WHITE CLOTH. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE  WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO. MIGUEL WAS JUST HERE GETTING COFFEE, MILK, AND SUGAR. GOTTA HAVE THAT FOR BRUNCH. AND HE SAID HE'S ALMOST DONE. OKAY, 1 TABLESPOON  OF GRATED LEMON ZEST... 2 TABLESPOONS OF FRESHLY SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE. THERE'S NOTHING  LIKE FRESH LEMON JUICE. WHATEVER COMES IN A BOTTLE  DOESN'T APPROXIMATE IT. I ALSO THINK IT ACTUALLY  HAS A VERY SHORT SHELF LIFE. SOMETIMES I'LL SQUEEZE  THE LEMONS IN ADVANCE, AND IT NEVER TASTES THE SAME  AS FRESH. OKAY, 1/2 A TEASPOON  OF GOOD VANILLA... 1 TEASPOON OF SALT. I'M JUST GONNA MIX IT  ALL TOGETHER UNTIL EVERYTHING'S  PERFECTLY COMBINED. BECAUSE INA LIKES PEOPLE  TO HELP THEMSELVES, I HAVE CHOSEN THIS THERMOS  OF COFFEE. THERE'S MILK, SUGAR, AND I ALSO CHOSE  THIS APRICOT NAPKIN. BY CHANCE,  WHEN I WENT TO THE KITCHEN, I REALIZED THAT INA'S MAKING  APRICOT BUTTER, SO IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER. SO NOW WE NEED THE FLOWERS  FROM MICHAEL, AND I'LL GO GET MY CAMERA. ♪♪ WHEW! I CAN HARDLY WAIT  TO SEE WHAT BRUNCH IS. ♪♪ SO THE BOTTOM PANCAKE'S DONE, AND NOW I'M GONNA POUR  THE FILLING RIGHT OVER IT. INSTEAD OF MAKING  LOTS OF SMALL PANCAKES AND FILLING EACH ONE, WHAT I'M DOING  IS MAKING ONE HUGE PANCAKE AND THEN I'M GONNA  CUT IT IN SQUARES AFTER IT'S ALL BAKED TOGETHER. IT'S JUST AS DELICIOUS AND SO MUCH LESS TROUBLE. SO I'M JUST GONNA SPREAD  THE FILLING OUT EVENLY. THIS LOOKS GOOD, DOESN'T IT? AND NOW I'M JUST GONNA POUR THE PANCAKE BATTER THAT'S LEFT, THE OTHER HALF,  RIGHT ON TOP. SO I'M JUST USING THIS SPOON SO I CAN DISTRIBUTE IT  REALLY EVENLY, AND IT DOESN'T GET MIXED IN  TO THE CHEESE LAYER. AND IT REALLY WORKS. SO IT'S BASICALLY A PANCAKE  ON THE BOTTOM, CHEESE FILLING, AND A PANCAKE ON THE TOP, AND THE WHOLE THING  JUST BAKES TOGETHER. IT'S KIND OF SURPRISING  THAT IT WORKS, ISN'T IT? OKAY. PERFECT.  SO BACK INTO THE OVEN, 350 DEGREES  FOR 35 TO 40 MINUTES, AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE MOST  DELICIOUS BAKED BLINTZES. NEXT, IT'S FRESH BLUEBERRY  SAUCE TO GO WITH THE BLINTZES AND THEN THE MOMENT OF TRUTH-- MIGUEL'S TABLE SETTING,  MICHAEL'S FLOWERS, AND MY FOOD. IT'S TIME  TO PULL EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND SEE IF WE'VE PULLED OFF  THE PERFECT BRUNCH. I'M DOING AN ARTICLE ON BRUNCH,  BUT IT'S A TEAM EFFORT. MY FRIEND MIGUEL IS DOING  THE TABLE SETTING. MICHAEL IS DOING THE FLOWERS. AND, OF COURSE, HELLO,  I'M DOING THE FOOD. FOR THE MAIN COURSE,  I'M MAKING BAKED BLINTZES. THEY'RE IN THE OVEN. AND I'M MAKING FRESH  BLUEBERRY SAUCE TO GO WITH IT. IT'S FANTASTIC.  I'LL SHOW YOU HOW I MAKE IT. THERE ARE  JUST A HANDFUL OF INGREDIENTS. FIRST INTO THE PAN IS 3/4 OF A CUP OF FRESHLY SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE WITH 2/3 OF A CUP OF SUGAR AND 1 TABLESPOON OF CORNSTARCH. EVERYTHING GETS MIXED TOGETHER. BRING IT TO A BOIL,  STIRRING IT OCCASIONALLY. WHEN IT'S TRANSLUCENT  AND THICKENED A LITTLE BIT, YOU STIR IN 4 1/2 PINTS  OF FRESH BLUEBERRIES, THEN SIMMER THE SAUCE  FOR FOUR TO FIVE MINUTES JUST UNTIL A FEW BERRIES  HAVE BURST BUT MOST ARE STILL WHOLE. AND THEN I ADD 1 TEASPOON  OF GRATED LEMON ZEST AND 1 TABLESPOON OF FRESHLY SQUEEZED LEMON JUICE. BLUEBERRY SAUCE IS DONE.  IT SMELLS FANTASTIC. SO I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT  IN A PITCHER SO WE CAN SERVE IT  AT THE TABLE. YEAH. AND THE BLINTZES ARE DONE. HOW GREAT IS THAT? WOW.  OH, THEY SMELL FANTASTIC. YOU CAN SMELL THE CHEESE  AND THE LEMON. SO I'M GONNA CUT THEM  IN SQUARES. LET'S SEE.  HOW BIG ARE THESE SQUARES? I THINK I'LL CUT IT  IN EIGHT SQUARES. THAT'S ONE. AND TWO. THESE ARE BIG SQUARES,  BUT IT'S THE MAIN COURSE. WELL, THAT'S THE FOOD DONE. IT'S TIME  TO PULL EVERYTHING TOGETHER AND SEE IF WE'VE PULLED OFF  THE PERFECT BRUNCH. ♪♪ WOW! WHAT HAVE YOU TWO  COOKED UP HERE? THIS IS GORGEOUS.  THANK YOU. MWAH.  THANKS. HELLO.  DOESN'T IT LOOK GREAT? I LOVE THE BLUE AND WHITE  AND THAT SORT OF APRICOT. HOW FABULOUS. I WOULD SAY THEY'RE READY  FOR THEIR CLOSE-UP. CAN I? MAY I?  ABSOLUTELY. PERFECT. I'LL START SHOOTING.  HOW BEAUTIFUL. OKAY. I'LL GO--I'LL BE FAST SO YOU CAN EAT SOON.  (laughs) YEAH.  THAT'S RIGHT. WE WANT YOU  TO BE REALLY FAST. (Ina) I LIKE THAT  SORT OF GROUP SPIRIT THING. (Michael) YES. EVERYBODY DOES  THEIR THING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE REALLY GOOD PEOPLE TO WORK WITH. AND HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.  YEAH. AMAZING.  EVERYTHING LOOKS GREAT--  THE FLOWERS, THE FOOD. DO WE GET TO EAT THIS? (Miguel) YES, I HOPE SO. OR ARE WE JUST SUPPOSED  TO PHOTOGRAPH IT? I HOPE SO. I HOPE SO.  I THINK I'M HERE JUST TO PHOTOGRAPH. I LOVE THAT YOU USED  THESE LITTLE EGGS AND EGG CUPS  FOR MY FAVORITE FLOWER. THEY'RE JUST FANTASTIC. I GOT IT.  EXCELLENT. LET'S EAT. PERFECT. PERFECT. YOU GUYS SIT THERE.  HOW FABULOUS. MMM.  OKAY. MIGUEL, WILL YOU HELP  YOURSELF TO... YES. GRANOLA. I'D LOVE A CROISSANT.  THANK YOU.  OH, PERFECT.  PERFECT, MIGUEL. AND I'M GONNA HAVE THE BLINTZES. HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE  BLINTZES?  BLINTZES.  YOU DID VERY WELL... OH, GOOD.  FOR YOUR FIRST BLINTZ.  (laughs) OOH, THIS GRANOLA  LOOKS WONDERFUL. MMM. IT'S GOT HAZELNUTS  AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS IN IT. AND DO YOU WANT SOME BLUEBERRY  SAUCE FOR YOUR BLINTZES? YES, I LOVE THAT. THAT GOES RIGHT ON TOP. OOH! THAT LOOKS SO GOOD.  OH, MY GOD, IT LOOKS DELICIOUS. DOES THAT LOOK GOOD?  CHEERS, EVERYBODY.  CHEERS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.  I HOPE YOU LOVE IT. I LIKE OUR PLAN,  SHARING A MEAL LIKE THIS. (both) IT'S PERFECT. I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT  FOR DINNER, HOW'S THAT? WHY NOT? YEAH, LET'S DO IT.  EXCEPT I'M NOT DOING  THE FOOD. AND I'M NOT DOING FLOWERS. AND I'M NOT GONNA  DECORATE IT. OKAY, YOU DO THE FOOD.  I'LL DO THE FLOWERS. AND YOU DECORATE.  I'LL SET THE TABLE. SET THE TABLE. DEAL.
