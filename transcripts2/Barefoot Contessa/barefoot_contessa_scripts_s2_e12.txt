  WHEN I TOLD MY FRIENDS I WAS  THINKING ABOUT MAKING HAM FOR THANKSGIVING,  THEY WENT CRAZY. "NO TURKEY?" THEY CRIED. SO I DECIDED TO CAVE IN, AND I'M  MAKING EVERYONE'S FAVORITE -- TURKEY WITH HERB  AND APPLE STUFFING. PUMPKIN BANANA MOUSSE TART, AND NO HAM. SO FOR THANKSGIVING, EVERYBODY  HAS TO HAVE PUMPKIN PIE. BUT AT MY HOUSE MOTHER  USED TO MAKE A PUMPKIN BANANA MOUSSE TART, WHICH WAS ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.

 SO I'M DOING A VERSION OF THAT. IT'S KIND OF LIKE PUMPKIN PIE  WITH THE VOLUME TURNED UP. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS, IT STARTS  WITH A GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST. SO 14 GRAHAM CRACKERS  ALL GROUND UP. IT'S GOT 2 CUPS OF  GRAHAM CRACKER CRUMBS. A THIRD OF A CUP OF SUGAR. AND I PUT A LITTLE BIT OF  CINNAMON IN. I JUST THINK IT GIVES IT  NICE PUMPKIN PIE SPICE, LOTS OF FLAVOR. BIG ON FLAVOR. AND THEN LAST THING, OF COURSE,  IS BUTTER. SO IT'S ONE STICK  OF MELTED BUTTER. I'M JUST GOING  TO MIX IT ALL TOGETHER. SO LATER I'M GOING TO FILL THIS  WITH A PUMPKIN MOUSSE

 THAT'S FLAVORED WITH A LITTLE  BIT OF BANANA, WHICH MAKES IT  WONDERFULLY SWEET, AND SOME ORANGE ZEST. AND LOTS OF SPICES...  IT'S REALLY GOOD. INTO AN 11-INCH TART SHELL. CLEAN HANDS, ALWAYS  A COOK'S BEST TOOL. SO JUST PAT IT OUT SO IT'S EVEN. AND THEN I TAKE A CUP MEASURE,  METAL CUP MEASURE, AND DO THE EDGE JUST LIKE THAT. THEN YOU DON'T END UP WITH THAT  THICK CRUST RIGHT AT THE EDGE. IT'S SO MUCH EASIER  THAN TRADITIONAL PIE CRUST. SO INTO THE OVEN,  350° FOR ABOUT 10 MINUTES, UNTIL IT'S JUST A LITTLE FIRMER  THAN IT IS NOW. AND NOW WE GET TO MAKE  THE GOOD PART -- THE PUMPKIN BANANA  MOUSSE FILLING. SO THE FIRST THING IS  1/2 CUP OF HALF AND HALF. AND I'M GOING TO PUT IT  INTO A DOUBLE BOILER. I KNOW EVERY STARTER SET OF POTS COMES WITH A DOUBLE BOILER, WHICH IS TWO POTS,  ONE ON TOP OF THE OTHER. BUT YOU CAN REALLY MAKE  YOUR OWN DOUBLE BOILER BY PUTTING A HEAT-PROOF BOWL  DIRECTLY OVER A POT. THE NEXT THING IS ONE 15-OUNCE  CAN OF PUMPKIN PUREE. I'VE DONE THIS WITH COOKING  A PUMPKIN AND PUREEING IT OR A CAN OF PUMPKIN PUREE. AND BELIEVE ME, YOU CAN'T  TELL THE DIFFERENCE. AND I CAN TELL YOU  WHICH ONE'S EASIER. OKAY, SO THAT'S IN. NEXT INGREDIENT IS  1 CUP OF BROWN SUGAR. AND YOU WANT THIS SORT OF  LIGHTLY PACKED. IT'S HOW BROWN SUGAR IS  GENERALLY MEASURED. RIGHT INTO THE PUMPKIN. 3/4 TEASPOON OF SALT. 1/2 TEASPOON OF CINNAMON. AND 1/4 TEASPOON OF NUTMEG. I THINK THE TART SHELL'S  READY TO COME OUT OF THE OVEN. PERFECT. IT'S JUST A LITTLE BROWN  AROUND THE EDGES, AND IT'S JUST GOING TO COOL  AND GET FIRM. SO NOW I'M GOING  TO MAKE THE CUSTARD. SO I'VE GOT TWO EGG YOLKS. AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS, I WANT TO WARM UP  THE EGG YOLKS A LITTLE BIT WITH THE PUMPKIN MIXTURE SO I DON'T END UP  WITH SCRAMBLED EGGS. JUST LIKE MAKING  A TRADITIONAL CUSTARD. AND THEN POUR THE WHOLE THING BACK INTO THE HOT PUMPKIN  MIXTURE. MY SCRAPER. I JUST WANT TO GET ALL OF IT. THEN JUST MIX THAT UP. AND JUST COOK THAT  FOR ABOUT 4 OR 5 MINUTES. SO IT'S GOING TO GO  INTO THAT TART SHELL. IT'S GOING TO COOL OVERNIGHT  IF YOU WANT TO. YOU CAN MAKE IT THE DAY BEFORE. AND THEN I'M GOING TO DECORATE  IT WITH WHIPPED CREAM. SO IT'S NOT ONLY DELICIOUS,  BUT IT'S REALLY GORGEOUS. SO I WANT TO TAKE  ONE PACKAGE OF GELATIN. AND JUST SOFTEN IT  IN 1/4 CUP OF COLD WATER. WHEN IT'S CHILLED, THE EGG YOLKS ARE GOING  TO HELP THE MOUSSE TO SET. BUT THE GELATIN'S GOING  TO HELP IT, TOO. OKAY, OFF THE HEAT. I'M JUST GOING TO ADD THESE  OTHER INGREDIENTS, MASHED BANANAS. AND THE SOFTENED GELATIN. AND THE LAST THING  IS ORANGE ZEST. OKAY, I'M JUST GOING  TO STIR THIS UP. SO WHILE THAT COOLS,  I'M GOING TO WHIP THE CREAM. I NEED ABOUT 1/2 CUP  OF HEAVY CREAM. AND 2 TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR. OKAY, THAT SHOULD DO IT. YOU CAN DO THIS WITH A HAND  MIXER IF YOU WANT TO ALSO. OKAY, THAT'S PERFECT. WITH WHIPPED CREAM, YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY FIRM, LIKE THAT, THAT IT STANDS UP. BUT IF YOU GET IT TOO FAR,  YOU END UP WITH BUTTER. YOU DON'T WANT THAT. ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO FOLD  THIS INTO THE PUMPKIN MIXTURE. SO PUT THE WHIPPED CREAM  RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. AND THEN WITH A SPATULA --  I USE A RUBBER SPATULA -- JUST GO STRAIGHT DOWN  THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND THEN FOLD IT OVER THAT WAY. STRAIGHT DOWN  THROUGH THE MIDDLE, AND THEN RIGHT  TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BOWL, AND THEN FOLD IT OVER --  JUST KEEP DOING THAT UNTIL IT'S REALLY WELL MIXED. MM, THIS IS LOOKING GORGEOUS. PERFECT. POUR IT RIGHT  INTO THE GRAHAM CRACKER CRUST. IT SMELLS GREAT, AND  THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THIS IS YOU CAN MAKE IT IN ADVANCE, LEAVE IT IN THE FRIDGE  FOR A DAY, AND THEN DECORATE IT JUST BEFORE  YOU'RE GOING TO SERVE IT. DOESN'T LOOK HALF BAD, DOES IT? SO I POLLED ALL MY FRIENDS TO FIND OUT WHAT THEIR FAVORITE  THING FOR THANKSGIVING IS. BUT THE TRUTH IS,  I CAN'T HAVE THANKSGIVING WITHOUT THIS CRANBERRY  FRUIT CONSERVE. SO I'M GOING TO ADD  A CUP OF WATER. AND 1 3/4 CUPS OF SUGAR. SO I'M GOING  TO COOK THIS TOGETHER FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES... UNTIL THE CRANBERRIES  SORT OF POP OPEN. WHEN IT GETS REALLY HOT,  THE SKINS BURST OPEN. AND THEN YOU GET ALL OF  THE CRANBERRY FRUIT IN THIS CONSERVE. THE NEXT THING I'M GOING  TO PUT IN IS APPLE. AND, ACTUALLY,  GRANNY SMITH APPLES ARE GREAT BECAUSE THE GREEN APPLES  HAVE A LOT OF PECTIN IN IT. AND IT'S THE PECTIN  THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THE CRANBERRY FRUIT  CONSERVE SET. SO YOU WANT TO PICK  A REALLY TART APPLE. THE TARTER THE APPLE,  THE MORE PECTIN IT HAS. I'M JUST GOING TO PEEL  THIS LITTLE GUY. AND THEN JUST CHOP IT UP. YOU WANT IT TO SORT OF DISAPPEAR WHEN IT COOKS INTO THE CONSERVE. SO I'M GOING TO CHOP IT UP FINE. THIS APPLE'S NICELY CHOPPED UP. IT'S GOING TO GO INTO A BOWL. AND THEN I'M GOING TO HAVE  THE ZEST OF AN ORANGE AND THE ZEST OF A LEMON. I CAN HEAR THE CRANBERRIES  POPPING. OKAY, ONE ORANGE  AND THE ZEST OF A LEMON. I JUST THINK THIS REALLY  TAKES AWAY FROM THE SWEETNESS OF THE FRUIT CONSERVE. OKAY, THAT'S THE ZEST. I'M JUST GOING TO CHECK AND SEE  HOW THE CRANBERRIES ARE DOING. AND I'D SAY THEY'RE POPPING. OKAY, THAT'S GOING TO COOK FOR  ANOTHER FEW MINUTES WHILE I JUICE THE FRUIT. OKAY, SO THE JUICE  OF ONE ORANGE AND THE JUICE OF A LEMON. OKAY, SO ALL THIS IS  GOING TO GO IN. THE APPLES AND THE ORANGE ZEST  AND LEMON ZEST. AND THEN I'M GOING TO COOK THEM  ALL TOGETHER FOR ABOUT 15 MINUTES. GREAT, SO WHILE THAT'S COOKING, I'M GOING TO START  THE HERB AND APPLE STUFFING. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD STUFFING  FOR THE TURKEY. IT'S VERY TRADITIONAL, BUT IT'S GOT A MUCH MORE  MODERN ZING TO IT. AND NOW I JUST NEED TO GET  SOME OTHER INGREDIENTS. 2 CUPS OF ONIONS. AND 2 CUPS OF CHOPPED CELERY. ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE THEM  DONE IN ADVANCE. THE NEXT THING  IS TWO CHOPPED APPLES INTO THE SAUTE PAN  WITH THE CELERY AND ONIONS. YOU NEED A BIG PAN FOR THIS. OKAY, SO THAT'S GOING TO COOK  ON SORT OF MEDIUM LOW HEAT. SO I'M GOING TO HAVE ABOUT  2 TABLESPOONS OF FRESH PARSLEY. IT DOESN'T HAVE  TO BE PERFECTLY MINCED, JUST SORT OF ROUGH CHOPPED. AND THEN I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT 1 1/2 TEASPOONS  OF FRESH ROSEMARY. AND WE JUST NEED  SALT AND PEPPER. THE ONIONS WILL JUST  START TO BROWN. AND I THINK IT REALLY  BRINGS OUT ALL THE FLAVOR IN THE VEGETABLES. IN THE MEANTIME, I'M GOING  TO FINISH THE CRANBERRY SAUCE. SO FOR THE TRADITIONALISTS,  I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT PLAIN. AND FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME  THAT WANT A LITTLE MORE FLAVOR, I'M GOING TO ADD  WALNUTS AND RAISINS. SO THESE ARE TWO DISHES I'M GOING TO SERVE THEM IN. AND I CAN JUST CHILL THEM  RIGHT IN THE DISH. SO THAT'S THE CRANBERRY  FRUIT CONSERVE. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WANTS THANKSGIVING EXACTLY THE WAY  THEY REMEMBER IT WHEN THEY WERE KIDS,  SO I REALLY TRY AND DO IT FOR EACH PERSON  THE WAY THEY REMEMBER IT. AND STEVEN DOESN'T LIKE NUTS, SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE HE HAS  EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS. SO I'M JUST GOING  TO ADD RAISINS AND CHOPPED WALNUTS  TO THE REST. JUST MIX THEM IN. AND IT'S GOT GREAT FLAVOR  AND TEXTURE. SO WE'VE GOT CRANBERRY  FRUIT CONSERVE FOR THE TRADITIONALISTS AND THE WILD AND CRAZY ONES. SO I HAVE BREAD CUBES  THAT I'VE TOASTED, SOURDOUGH BREAD, WHICH I LIKE. AND, UM, I TOASTED THEM JUST SO THEY GET  SOME OF THE MOISTURE OUT. AND THEN IT'LL REALLY ABSORB  THE FLAVORS OF THE TURKEY AND THE STOCK  AND EVERYTHING ELSE. SO I'M JUST GOING  TO TAKE ALL THE VEGETABLES I JUST COOKED  AND POUR IT RIGHT OVER. I'M GOING TO ADD ABOUT A CUP  OF CHICKEN STOCK. HM, I LOVE THE WAY THAT SMELLS,  THE COOKED APPLES AND CELERY. AND TOSS IT ALL TOGETHER. MM. AND THAT'S READY  TO GO INSIDE A BIG BIRD. THIS YEAR I TRIED  SUGGESTING TO MY FRIENDS THAT WE MAKE A BAKED VIRGINIA  HAM FOR THANKSGIVING, AND THEY WENT NUTS. THEY SAID,  "WE HAVE TO HAVE TURKEY." SO WE'RE HAVING TURKEY. SO I'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD  FRESH 12-POUND TURKEY. AND I'M GOING TO STUFF IT  AND TRUSS IT. AND IT'S SO EASY,  YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT. YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS YOUNG,  MY MOTHER USED TO GET UP AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING  TO MAKE TURKEY. I THINK I HAD THIS FEELING THEY HAD TO COOK FOR,  LIKE, 15 HOURS. BUT THE TRUTH IS, A TURKEY REALLY ONLY NEEDS  ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS TO COOK, AND IT'LL BE REALLY MOIST  AND DELICIOUS. SO I'M JUST GOING  TO STUFF THE CAVITY FULL BUT NOT REALLY PACKED. YOU WANT THE HEAT  TO BE ABLE TO GET AROUND SO IT CAN COOK PROPERLY. OKAY, THAT LOOKS GOOD. SO I'M JUST GOING TO TIE ITS  LITTLE LEGS TOGETHER. AND THEN TIE AROUND THE TAIL SO THAT'S NOT FLAPPING AROUND. JUST CUT IT OFF. AND THE ONLY OTHER THING TO DO  JTA THE WING TIPS, JUST LIKE DOING A CHICKEN, JUST TUCK THEM  RIGHT UNDERNEATH THE BODY SO IT KEEPS THEM  FROM FLAPPING AROUND. OKAY, AND THEN THE LAST THING  IS I'M JUST GOING TO BRUSH IT WITH BUTTER. SALT AND PEPPER. SO THIS TURKEY, I'M GOING  TO ROAST AT 350° FOR ABOUT 2 1/2 HOURS. AND IT'S GOING TO BE  MOIST AND DELICIOUS. NOW COMES THE FUN PART -- DECORATING THE PUMPKIN  BANANA MOUSSE TART. IT SAT IN THE REFRIGERATOR  UNTIL IT JUST SET. AND THEN I'M GOING TO DECORATE  IT WITH WHIPPED CREAM. LOOKS PRETTY GOOD SO FAR. SO I NEED A CUP OF HEAVY CREAM. 1/4 CUP OF SUGAR. AND A SPLASH OF VANILLA. WHEN I SAY A SPLASH OF VANILLA, I MEAN MAYBE  1/4 OR 1/2 TEASPOON. I'M JUST GOING TO WHIP IT  UNTIL IT'S FIRM. THAT LOOKS GOOD... I WANT IT  REALLY NICE AND FIRM BUT NOT TURNED INTO BUTTER. AND THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT...  GREAT SO THE EASIEST WAY  TO DECORATE THIS -- AND IT'S PERFECTLY GREAT -- IS TO DO WHIPPED CREAM  AROUND THE MIDDLE, LEAVING A LITTLE BORDER  OF PUMPKIN, SORT OF LIKE MERINGUE,  ON THE TOP. BUT I LOVE TO PIPE IT, SO I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO THAT. SO TAKE A PASTRY BAG  WITH A BIG STAR TIP ON IT. I THINK THAT'S THE NICEST ONE  AND THE EASIEST. YOU KNOW, PIPING  LOOKS REALLY MYSTERIOUS, BUT THE WAY I LEARNED HOW TO DO  IT IS I JUST SPENT A DAY PIPING BUTTER CREAM OR WHIPPED CREAM. JUST PRACTICE,  AND YOU'LL GET IT. AND THE BEST WAY TO PRACTICE  IS JUST ON A BOARD OR ON THE MARBLE. SO -- BECAUSE YOU CAN KEEP USING  IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO I'LL SHOW YOU... IF YOU  WANTED TO DO A SHELL PATTERN, WHICH IS WHAT I LIKE TO DO, JUST A LITTLE BIT LIKE THAT,  JUST LIKE THAT. AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT  THE PRESSURE IN THE BAG AND REALLY GETTING A FEEL  FOR IT -- IT'S NOT THAT HARD. IF YOU WANT TO DO SOMETHING EVEN  SIMPLER, IT'S JUST STARS. BUT I THINK FOR THIS ONE, I'M GONNA DO THE SHELL PATTERN. SO JUST ALL THE WAY AROUND. JUST DO LIKE A RIBBON PATTERN. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS,  IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, YOU CAN JUST SCOOP IT BACK  INTO THE BAG AND DO IT AGAIN. HOW HARD IS THAT? OKAY, AND THEN MAYBE A LITTLE  SWIRL IN THE MIDDLE. GREAT. AND THEN BECAUSE  I LIKE THE DECORATION TO BE THE FLAVORS  THAT ARE IN THE TART, I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE REALLY  NICE TO DECORATE IT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ORANGE,  MAYBE SOME ORANGE ZEST. THE TRADITIONAL THING THAT I USE  FOR ORANGE ZEST IS THIS ZESTER. BUT YOU'LL SEE IT ENDS UP  VERY FINE. AND I THINK I HAVE  A BETTER WAY TO DECORATE. YOU SEE, IT'S REALLY TOO FINE. BUT THEN THE OTHER ZESTER IS THIS LITTLE WONDERFUL TOOL THAT  JUST HAS LITTLE SHARP EDGES. AND I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT IT DOES  WITH THE ORANGE. IT HAS LONG STRIPS OF ZEST. AND I THINK THAT WOULD  BE REALLY PRETTY TO DECORATE THE TART WITH. AND THEN JUST TAKE IT AND PUT IT AROUND  THE EDGE, JUST SORT OF LIGHTLY. SO NOW SOMEBODY KNOWS  IT'S PUMPKIN AND ORANGE AND CREAM AND DELICIOUS. AND IT'S READY FOR DESSERT...  I'M JUST GOING TO KEEP IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR UNTIL  WE'RE READY TO SERVE IT. I THINK IT LOOKS NOT BAD. [ CORK POPS ] [ LAUGHTER ] FUN CHECK, WHO'S HAVING FUN? I NEED SOME OF THAT CHAMPAGNE. I THINK WE LOST HALF OF IT. CHEERS. OKAY, I'M OFF  TO CARVE THE TURKEY. I HAVE TO SAY,  CARVING IS NOT SOMETHING I GENERALLY DO  WITH COMPANY AROUND BECAUSE I CAN MAKE A REAL MESS. JUST CUT OFF THE LEG. NICE BIG LEG FOR SOMEBODY  THAT LIKES THAT. WHAT I DO IS, I LET THE TURKEY  SIT FOR ABOUT 20 MINUTES. AND ALL THE JUICES GET RIGHT  BACK INTO THE TURKEY. IT REALLY MAKES IT  FLAVORFUL AND MOIST. MMM. AND THE TRICK  FOR THE WHITE MEAT IS, INSTEAD OF SLICING IT THE WAY  IT'S TRADITIONALLY DONE, I'M GOING TO RUN  MY KNIFE AROUND THE -- CUT OFF THE ENTIRE BREAST IN ONE PIECE AND THEN SLICE IT. THAT'S EXACTLY THE WAY  I LIKE TO DO A CHICKEN. AND THEN JUST SLICE IT  RIGHT ACROSS. I THINK IT'S SO MUCH EASIER  THAN WRESTLING WITH IT. OH, THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD. SET IT ON ONE SIDE. AND I WOULD SAY THAT  LOOKS LIKE THANKSGIVING. AND I HAVE PARMESAN  SMASHED POTATOES. EVERY FAMILY HAS  THEIR FAVORITE RECIPE, SO THIS IS MINE. AND I KEEP IT WARM ON THE TOP  OF A DOUBLE BOILER. AND THEN FRANK  WANTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS, SO I'VE ROASTED  BRUSSELS SPROUTS. I ROASTED THEM  AT A REALLY HIGH TEMPERATURE WITH OLIVE OIL, SALT AND PEPPER. IT COULDN'T BE EASIER. AND THAT'S WHAT FRANK  WANTED FOR THANKSGIVING. AND PLAIN CRANBERRY  FRUIT CONSERVE AND CRANBERRY FRUIT CONSERVE  WITH RAISINS AND NUTS. OH, FABULOUS. LOOK AT THIS,  IT'S FANTASTIC. ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THE TURKEY. AND I'LL BE IN CHARGE  OF THE VEGETABLES. I HAVE YOUR FAVORITE  BRUSSELS SPROUTS. OH, THEY LOOK DELICIOUS. ARE WE READY TO ROCK?  YES, INDEED. COME, EVERYBODY,  HELP YOURSELF. Woman: OH, THIS LOOKS  SO WONDERFUL. Frank: BOY, I'M HUNGRY. I'M REALLY HUNGRY. I HAVEN'T EATEN FOR WEEKS. Ina: DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH  CRANBERRY SAUCE? THAT'S CHEESE ON THE POTATOES, PARMESAN? PARMESAN, MAYBE  A LITTLE SOUR CREAM. HERE'S TO THE ABSENT  JEFFREY. JEFFREY.  JEFFREY.  JEFFREY. HE'LL BE MISSED.  HE HAS NO IDEA  WHAT HE'S MISSING. MY EXPERIENCE IS NOBODY  REMEMBERS WHAT THEY HAD  FOR DINNER BUT THEY ALWAYS  REMEMBER DESSERT. ALL RIGHT, WHO WANTS  PUMPKIN BANANA MOUSSE TART? I KNOW NYRIE NEEDS A PIECE. Nyrie: THANK YOU. Ina: EVERYBODY COOL? SO IT TURNS OUT YOU KNOW  HOW TO COOK AFTER ALL. SOMETIMES I EVEN  SURPRISE MYSELF. HAPPY THANKSGIVING. NOW WE CAN GO  CHRISTMAS SHOPPING.
