 Welcome to Last Resort
 [People chattering]
 They didn't have plain mint,
so I got you raspberry mint
 and a mystery
meat sandwich.
 Yum.
 So, did you get
mom and dad a card yet,
 or do you wanna just
sign this one?
 I was gonna
get them a card.
 Right.
 Give me that.
 Beautiful, huh?
 Huh?
 Countryside.
 Oh, uh...
 Just sign the card.
 Excuse me for looking out
for my little sister.
 You never know. He could be
a serial killer or something.
 Shh.
 [Whispering]
Keep your voice down.
 When you talk low
like this,
 it's actually harder to hear
than a whisper.
 You're making that up.
 Tell that to the Taliban.
 Jeez, Cali, you wrote them
a novel here.
 Another hour till
we get there.
 You'll think of something.
 [Phone ringing]
 Announcer: All passengers connecting to bus lines at Hartford station,
  please use platform 2.
 [Passengers chatting]
 What are you doing?
 I need you to do
exactly as I say.
 No time for questions.
Just listen.
 When I start
walking down this car,
 I want you to grab
that backpack there. See?
 Bryan, what's going on?
 Do you see it?
Yeah.
 When the...Tells you it's his,
you argue with him.
 You keep it going till
i either come back, or
i shout out your name.
 And if i
shout out your name,
you get down
 You crawl into a space
between those seats.
 You're really scaring me.
 Just do as I say.
 Everything is gonna
be fine.
 Man: Hey, excuse me.
 That belongs to me.
 What? No.
I don't think so.
 Man: Yes, it does.
Just give it back.
 You don't need to talk to me
like that.
 Check the name,
this is my bag.
 What the hell
is your problem, miss?
 I don't care
what you're saying.
This is my bag.
 It's mine, all right?
Just let go of the bag.
 I'm not gonna
let go!
 Cali!
 Woman 1: What are you doing?
 Woman 2: Get down!
 [Passengers screaming]
 [Woman screaming]
 Okay, listen up.
I'm a cop.
 No one move, all right?
 Everyone stay
where you are.
 You got cuffs?
 Cali?
 [Cell phone ringing]
 Yeah.
 No, I'm not near a TV.
Just give me the headlines.
 Bryan. Bryan.
Bryan.
 Bryan, can you tell us
what happened?
 It's a very difficult time
for my family,
 as you can see.
 A little respect for that
right now will be
much appreciated.
 Reporter:
Bryan, what tipped you off?
 Have you eaten
anything, Bryan?
 I fixed you something.
 [Sobbing]
 [Wailing]
 What's local
law enforcement saying?
 Still waiting
for a statement.
 Christina: No outburst, no delusional rant?
 Total silence,
from what we're hearing.
 Okay. Now I'm interested.
 And there's this.
 Ex-military, green beret,
three tours in Afghanistan.
 I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say this isn't
middle east related.
 Puerto berrio, Colombia,
January 2015.
 Mills' last active
service posting
 as liaison to Colombian
special forces
 for operation snow Joe,
 to capture Carlos meija,
 aka "El carnicero",
"the butcher". Whatever.
 Last seen seven years ago.
 CIA based on source
and asset reports
 believes his cartel
is now running
 terrorists and weapons
as well as drugs into the us.
 Puerto where?
Berrio.
 Thing is meija
wasn't even there.
 But his son Miguel was.
 Christina: Our friend
on the train did this?
 Yep. While saving the life
of an undercover DEA agent,
 Mike hall.
 If this is meija avenging
the death of his son,
 he's probably not
gonna stop until it's done.
 Good.
 Good.
 So, starting right now,
 we control the story.
 Write state and local
law enforcement, FBI, CIA,
 I want everyone
on the same sheet of music.
 This was
two delusional maniacs.
Investigation ongoing.
 Okay? You guys
know the rest.
 You call the national
security advisor.
 Tell him I'm on my way.
 [Gate buzzing]
 Who are you?
 Okay. Good.
 Unlock him, please.
 [Gate buzzing open]
 My associate Becca.
 What did you tell
the police?
 Nothing.
 We have to ask.
 And now you know.
 And tomorrow.
What about it?
 And the next day,
and the next day.
 I don't buy it.
 Excuse me?
 What's she's saying is
she doesn't believe
it's possible
 for you to
say nothing forever.
 But the type of people we
believe are gonna be
coming at you next...
 I have to agree.
 Not sure
I'd buy it either.
 What the hell is this?
 What were you expecting?
 They'd send someone
to spring you?
 Really?
 Our client has instructed us
to tell you that your family
 will be generously
compensated
 for your sacrifice.
 This wasn't the deal!
 The hit was...
Was what?
 It was a good hit.
How do you figure that?
 We got her, didn't we?
 What about him?
No, no.
 We were told
to leave him for...
 [Coughing]
 Didn't she just tell you
it'd be impossible
 for you to say
nothing forever?
 Are you cops?
 Please.
 John: In case you hadn't
figured it out already,
 your life is
in our hands now.
 So if I were you,
 I'd start trying to
live in the moment.
 Who's that woman sitting
next to Henry masters?
 Priest: We'll begin by
standing for eternal father,
 which you will find on
page 352 of your hymn book.
 [Church organ playing]
  ¶ Eternal father strong to save
  ¶ whose arms restrained the restless wave
  ¶ who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep
  ¶ its own appointed bounds to keep
  ¶ we cry, o father, majesty
  ¶ for those in peril on the sea ¶
 Cali was my best friend.
 My roommate.
 My inspiration.
 If ever someone was put
on this planet for
 the sole purpose of
caring for others,
 it was Cali mills.
 We got us some
tourist in town.
 Where?
A block from the house.
 Black panel Van.
 How many?
Couldn't see. Tinted windows.
 Okay.
 Hi.
Hi.
 Asha.
Right.
 Sorry. Um...
 I just wanted to tell you
 that Cali never stopped
talking about you.
 Her war hero brother.
 She probably made
a lot more of that
than it actually was.
 You realize what you
said in the service there
makes you family now?
 It was okay.
 Are you kidding?
 I don't know how to
thank you, dear.
 Please know it was
my honor.
 Hey, mom, whose Van
is that out there?
 I don't know I've
never seen it before.
 Why?
Excuse me.
 Hey!
 Looking for me?
Here I am.
 Anything you
wanna tell me?
 This is my fault.
 Cali's dead
because of me.
 Your fault how?
 They weren't random psychos
on that train, dad.
 They were professionals.
Hired killers.
 So, cops, FBI,
they're all wrong?
 They're hiding
the truth.
 Why would they lie?
I don't know, dad.
 All I do know is I'm not gonna
risk you and mom
getting caught up in this, too.
 Dad: Let's just take
  Talk to Gerald Roberts. Have him post a police detail outside this house.
 Front and back,
24 hours a day.
 And tell him what?
 Tell him what
i just told you.
  And tell him to keep it to himself.
  Make something up.
  A couple of days at least.
 Where are you going?
 This is for
you and mom.
 I didn't know when would
be a good time
to give it to you.
 But now...
 Tell mom bye.
 Tell her I'm sorry,
and I'm gonna...
 You're gonna what?
 Your mother can't
lose you, too, son.
 I understand that, dad.
 Phone tracker's active.
 On the move.
 Devil's advocate.
 Make it quick.
 Why can't we tell him
what we're doing?
 Operational security.
 We don't know anything
about him.
 Vlasik: We know a little.
 Christina: Not enough.
Don't we have a moral duty?
 Okay, now you're boring me.
 Moral duty to what?
 To tell him we're using him
as bait to flush out
"El carnicero"?
 This is mills' life
we're playing with.
 Knowing what we now know
from the surviving gunman...
 Which is?
 I already covered that.
 One more time,
just for me.
 Carlos meija contracted a hit
on Brian mills' sister
  so mills can feel the same pain
  meija felt after his son was killed.
 Now he's hired mercenaries
to bring mills to him alive.
 See what you did there?
You left out
the most important part.
 Using mills gives us
our best opportunity
in ten years
 to take meija alive.
 Our only opportunity.
 And if he's working
with terrorists now,
 the only moral duty we have
is to find out who they are,
 where they are
and stop them.
 [Man speaking indistinctly]
 Let him go. Now!
 Man: We got him.
 He's home.

 What's up?
 When are you shooting this shot?
 Bryan: Excuse me for looking out for my little sister.
 All grown up now, thanks.
 [Boys chatting]
 John: Mama, this is papa. Comm check.
 Got you.
Just turn the cam comm up.
 John: I'm in now. Wait up.
 Christina: Roger, standing by.
 John: Same Van that did
a drive by minutes ago.
 We got us two tourists.
 Man and a woman.
  Looks like we have a ball game.
 Weapon.
 Weapons. Two.
 Plus silencer,
so I'm thinking
heckler & koch.
 Christina: Papa, this is mama.
Hold position. Do not engage.
 Say again. Do not engage.
 [Doorbell rings]
 John: He just took two down.
 Damn, he got out.
 Who are you?
 Who sent you?
 Come on.
 John: Tourists heading home.
 I'm moving in.
  Mills' still in the house, moving around the back.
  Wait out.
 I'll tell you this.
Dude's got some skills.
 [Tap running]
 Bryan: Let him go!
 I got you, Mike.
 I got you.
 [Upbeat music playing]
 Daddy, you're sweating
like a pig.
 [Grunting]
 Someone's calling you.
 Oh.
 Oh, there is a god
after all.
 Sorry, sweetheart,
it's work.
 Bryan?
Where are you right now?
 I'm at home. Why?
 Lianne with you?
 You need to get out
of there, both of you.
  Right now.
 DEA agent Mike hall.
 Bryan: You there?
Mike: Yeah.
 If they're coming at me,
it's only a matter of time
  before they come for you, too,
  if they are not already.
 Who... who's coming at you?
 So, the shooters on the train,
they were...
 And they just tried again,
this time at my house.
  Yeah, one in the leg. I'll be okay.
 It went straight through.
 Where are you?
 Some motel in Jersey.
 I'm coming to get you.
 No. Just get
lianne to safety.
 I can make a call,
send a team.
  No team. This is on me.
 Mike: That's insane.
 Just tell me you're putting
your daughter in a car
right now.
 Okay, fine. No buts. Go.
 Bye.
 [Cell phone vibrating]
 He's getting a call.
 Not according to this
he's not.
 It's not his phone.
Must be another one.
 [Cell phone vibrates]
 [Cell phone ringing]
 That's his phone.
 Incoming call.
703 area code.
 You and lianne on the road yet?
 You know, I can't just leave
you hanging out there.
 Bryan: I told you. Don't worry about me.
 Mike: It's not happening, buddy.
 No can do.
  Four years undercover with these bastards.
  I know how they think.
 All right. Motel biscayne.
 Route 202,
junction 7.
 Okay. Give me five hours.
 I'll call you when I'm
30 minutes out.
 [Cell phone vibrates]
 We think out loud here.
 You're not
at Langley anymore.
 Mills just told him his
daughter's life is in danger,
 and he's more worried about
mills than he's about her?
 Rescue team 3. Rescue team 3.
  They got you calling in.
 Stand by.
 He's on the move again.
 "K"?
 How long have you
been their bitch?
 I don't expect you
to understand.
 Bet you already switched
sides back when you
were undercover.
 Understand?
Is that what you just said?
 Look, I'm sorry
about your sister.
  But they threatened to kill my daughter.
 My daughter, Bryan.
Lianne.
 You really wanna know when
my cover was blown?
 When you and the Colombians
screwed pooch on that raid.
 Where is he?
 Are you serious?
 You honestly think I know
where Carlos meija is?
 I think you can do
better than that.
 My only contact with
the cartel is a lawyer.
  Where? New York.
 You'll get us there, then.
 Who's that?
 You didn't think they'd
be all over my ass, too?
 Who do you think you're
dealing with here, Bryan?
 The exit is that way.
 We're not getting out of here
alive, you know that, right?
 I need your tie.
What?
 Your tie.
 How long do you think
you can keep running, Bryan?
 A day, two? A week?
 One man against the resources
of the entire cartel?
 Interesting.
What?
 They're not shooting.
 [Indistinct dispatch chatter]
 Hey, hey.
Where are you going?
 You can't go down there.
 [Train chugging]
 You never met my sister,
did you?
 She was something,
let me tell you.
 Beautiful.
 Kind.
 Smart.
 I pray you never have to
make the kind of choice
i had to make.
 I mean that, Bryan.
 My advice,
don't ever have kids.
 Especially not a daughter.
 On the third rail.
 Don't want to hear it.
  I just want you gone.
 Pretty sure you've been told
I'm paying a debt.
 To take me alive.
 Or I'd be dead by now.
 I'm not spending the rest
of my life running from
you people.
 I'm throwing down
my weapon now.
 Not good.
 You mean, the phone?
 Bad news.
 Do I know you?
 They took your daughter.
 The cartel.
 How do you know?
 You really wanna stand
here wasting time
 talking about
everything we know?
 Get your phone out,
numbnuts.
 Your phone.
Get it out now.
 That was her school
calling you.
 Seven times.
 Patch in Echelon action NSA
and FBI.
 Langley, info only.
 Done. Done.
 And almost done.
 Okay. Make the call.
 This is your one shot
to get her back.
 Do you understand?
 Yeah.
 [Phone ringing]
 Here we go.
 Agent hall. To what do i
owe the pleasure?
 They took my daughter.
 Excuse me?
 You heard.
 I did everything that
was asked of me.
 Hold on, hold on.
This is not a secure line.
 You're gonna call your client
and get my daughter back.
 Right now.
 Or I hand myself in and
you're in a rikers' jumpsuit
by tonight.
 Now what?
 We're the ones who
took your daughter.
 You on the other hand,
we could stick a fork in.
 [Phone ringing]
 Yeah?
 I need to talk to my client.
 He's not here yet.
 What's his eta?
  Imminent.
 Meaning? Soon.
 Thank you. I meant...
 He's in the air.
 Okay.
 Don't hang up.
Just a couple more seconds.
  Are you on radio contact?
 Strict radio silence.
He contacts me first.
 Why? There a problem?
 Potentially.
 Will you break radio silence
if I say yes?
 Well, this wouldn't turn on
the lights on the runway.
 Is that what you're saying
I should do?
 Got it.
 Just have him call me
when he lands.
 Eyes and ears on the lawyer.
Re-route all calls.
 You killed my son.
 And you killed my sister.
 Yes.
 Yes, I did.
 Give me the 22 blade.
 Your son died
 holding a gun to the head
of a DEA agent.
 My sister died defenseless.
 And innocent.
 So what kind of a man,
i wonder,
 does that make you?
 Just as I figured.
 But I had to see it
for myself.
 The eyes of a coward.
 [Helicopter whirring]
 Man: Take him down, now.
 Man: Hurry up!
 Back off!
 Back off!
 Back off, or he dies.
 I'm already dead.
Take him down.
 He can't.
 Can you?
 I'm no use to them dead.
 Do it now.
Let him go.
 He killed my son!
 For my sister.
 John: Mama, this is papa. Target secured.
  Alive and kicking. Over.
 Christina: Mama, Roger. What about mills?
  Over.
 Christina: Those are ice chips
in that blue cup.
 You were at
my sister's funeral.
 Yes. I was.
 Who are you?
 The man who shot you
works for me.
 Where am I?
 Buffalo presbyterian
trauma wing.
 Do you understand why
you were shot?
 He killed my sister.
 My name
is Christina hart.
 I'm a deputy director
with special portfolio
 at the office of
the director of
national intelligence.
 You used me.
 I report to the director
of national intelligence,
 the national security council
and the president.
 And now you're gonna tell me
none of this ever happened.
 My portfolio
 is an emergency covert
action team.
 Who shot me?
 Who saved your life?
 Tell me what you
believe in, Bryan.
 Because what I see
is a man who is wired
to protect others.
 It's how you're built.
 It's who you are.
 It's why you tackled those
gunmen on the train
in the first place,
 to protect those
93 other passengers
 in that car.
 I just did what I did.
 But when you failed to
protect your own sister...
 Who the hell are you to...
 Tell me that's not
how you felt.
 It's how I still feel.
 Listen, taking
Carlos meija alive
 is vital
to national security.
 But acting on the intelligence
that he will share with us,
 make no mistake,
is where we're really
gonna earn our money.
 You're recruiting me.
 And if I say no?
 Yeah, you're right.
None of this ever happened.
 And Cali died
for nothing.
