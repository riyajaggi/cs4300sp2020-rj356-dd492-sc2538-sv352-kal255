 Asha Flynn. 29 years old. Junior associate at an environmental law firm here in D.C. Only child of Marcus and Esme Flynn. And, apparently, reading between the lines on the emails we got from her personal computer, - now in a relationship with Bryan. - Police believe she was taken about 6:30 last night in this van caught here by an external security camera, part of a recently installed state-of-the-art alarm system. Still no word from Bryan. Radio silence. All he's gonna care about now is getting her back.

 So we have to stop him. For his own good. There's some people say I should go on one of them singing shows. - You should. - Maybe I will. Who knows? What about you? Any hidden talents? I can cook. If you don't mind me asking, you in some kind of trouble? Someone took my girlfriend. To Texas? Maybe. This is one of my favorites. Hey. I hope you find her.

 I will. Two minutes. Talk to you boyfriend. We need to keep him motivated. Bryan, help me. Asha... Help me, Bryan. I know that he's there with you. I know that he can hear me. I need you to listen very carefully. I am coming. I will find you, I will find him, and there is nothing he or anyone else can do to stop me now. Nothing. - What'll it be? - Looking for Mick Lester. - He ain't here. - I heard he hangs out back. You heard wrong. I heard right. You wanna know how I know that? 'Cause Carlos Mejia told me. Carlos Mejia told you what? - Put that thing down. - Have a seat. You make him a boatload of cash moving his product. What do you want? Who would he contact to get over the border into Mexico? - He has people. - Who he's not gonna go to - because he gave them all up. - You saying he's a rat? - Then he's a dead man. - Not if he gets across the border. He runs all of his southwestern shipment through you. So who else does he know down here in Texas? This image is from an FBI surveillance camera - almost an hour ago. - What's he doing in Texas? He's trying to stop Mejia from crossing the border. You sent him down there? We've been watching that place ever since Mejia gave up Lester last month. Rein him in before he ruins any more of our operations. What's the priority here? Finding Mejia and the hostage or busting some mid-level dealer? Not the point. Our interests are the same as yours. If Bryan can bring us any closer to Mejia... He's a loose canon and he's done, so tie him down before I do. You people are finished with Mejia. This is an FBI operation now. That's not your decision to make. It's a direct order. From the White House. He runs all of his southwestern shipment through you. So who else does he know down here in Texas? Friends? Relatives? His ex-wife. But she doesn't... Alicia Mejia? She's dead. - Isn't she? - Come on, man, give me a break. You said they're watching me. Roll it back. His ex-wife. - But she doesn't... - Alicia Mejia? She's dead. Isn't she? Mejia's wife is alive. - The guy just admitted as much. - That's impossible. She killed herself after Bryan shot their son. We have it all on file. El Paso PD autopsy report, huge funeral. Totally credible narrative with no questions asked. Just another casualty of the war on drugs. Smart. Simple. Bryan's on his way to El Paso. He's gotta be. - Where is he now? - Angleton, Texas. - How far to El Paso? - It's about a five-hour drive. Standby with the jet. Find the wife. Mr. Mills? You killed my son, Mr. Mills. Yes, I did. What can you possibly have to say to me? - Your husband... - Ex-husband. I know what he is. Who he is. And just how long did it take you to see that? What do you want? Your husband is on the run. He's trying to get across to Mexico, but his network's broken. He can no longer trust his own people. And you think I still want to help him? I think you might not have a choice. What can he do to me? Without you, these children have no hope. I see. You are the lesser of two evil. Is that it? If you can smuggle children across the border, then you can send him back the same way. Does he know how you do it? You want me to help you? The man who murdered my son? Because he has a hostage. And she is innocent. Like the children. I'll pray for her. If praying were the answer, you would be doing what you do. You have to understand. This country is the only chance these children have for a life. Found him. - Damn it. - Bryan. Bryan, this is an FBI operation now. - We need to go home. - Home? - I'm not going home. - I'm not gonna sanction a suicide mission. You going down there on your own is not gonna save Asha Flynn, and it's not gonna be an end to Mejia. It's just going to be the loss of one good man for nothing. And no one here is going to standby and let that happen. Like it or not, you are too important to us all now and to what we do, and I'm not going to debate this with you. Come on. Come on, the car is out front. Damn it, Bryan. I'm on it, try to cut him off. What the hell? You okay? - You just ran in front of my car. - Sorry, man. Hey. Hey! You son of a... What do you think he will do now? Your Bryan Mills? I'll tell you what he's going to do. He's going to play directly into my hands in Mexico where I have the advantage because I control everybody from the army to the police. He will come for you. Let him come. Please. Esta bien. - Hola. - Hola. Senor. Muy bien? Bueno. Go ahead. Do it. Pull the trigger. Then what? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on. Come on. No. No. Go! Go! Put your weapons down. You stay behind. Make sure nobody else comes through. Okay. Welcome to Mexico. Hey, hey, hey. We come in peace. - I'm not going back. - Who's that? We never met. - Did you hear what I just said? - About going back? Yeah. Funny. - Easy now. - I can't. You don't have a choice. They're right there on the other side of that tunnel. Every minute we wait, we waste. - So let me go. - We can't do that. So another innocent person will die, and Mejia wins again. Is that really who we are? 'Cause if so, I quit. You're... You're damn right I don't have a choice. Look, I know this all started because of me, so I won't think less of anyone of you if you choose not to come do this, but you are not stopping me, and you know it. So you go ahead. Make your choice. You're some pain in the ass, you know that? - Stop! - They're taking her. She's alive. Think. - We're outgunned and outnumbered. - Buddy, if she's alive now, he doesn't want her dead. Yet. Hart. We're with him now. - You're on the way back? - We went the other way. - Excuse me? - We need your help. Your mission was to bring him in, - not to go to Mexico. - Give me the phone. Thanks John. That day when you recruited me, - you remember that? - Bryan... You gave me that whole speech about what I was born to do. - This is different. - How? Yeah, that's what I thought. I'll quit if I have to quit. You can order the others back, but not me. Put John back on the phone. - Yeah? - Are you with him on this? We all are. - Send Dave back. - We're all committed full... I want him to meet me in Juarez. I'm coming down. Come on, come on, guys. Got anything yet? We've got coverage of the six known properties owned by Carlos Mejia. One of them is showing significant activity. Let's go with that one. Call Hart. Hey, Carlos! - Look at you. - And you. This is Roderigo Acosta, my right-hand man, who I have trusted with everything while I've been away. I think you'll be pleased. Business is booming. Gracias a Dios. It's good to be among family again. Look after our guest. Make her comfortable. Make sure you position her in plain sight. I think it's going to be an eventful night. Special Agent Salt. Can we make this quick, please? Thanks for coming. I know Martello's running a couple undercover ops in Mexico. Wait, no, sorry. I can't discuss any of that. Let me put it this way. Bryan Mills needs help, you owe him. - Where is he? - Juarez. He needs firepower. There's a machine shop on Calle Colombia. You did not get this from me, and I need your word on that. I understand the drill. That won't be necessary. - Easy, easy now. - Whoa. If you'll allow him. Lower your gun, please. Tell them to leave. We've got business. - What's going on? Why are you here? - Need a favor. Listen, lady, I don't know who told you what, but this... Is an FBI undercover operation. Yes, we're aware. And we know FBI has no authority to be here. So what do you want? Everything. Pleasure doing business with you. Hey, amigo! Sierra, this is Alpha. Moving to the back entrance. Entering the house. We have a problem. We're picking up movement of a Mexican military unit on the move to Mejia's compound. I need you to get the ambassador on the phone. Make sure they know we've got agents in the house. We need rules of engagement. - Boy. - Got it. Keep an eye on the road around the compound. The second you see any movement, I need to know. You will. We have eyes. We have eyes on Mejia... And Asha. I see you're taken with our lovely guest. You want your friends to think you kept her safe from me. Tell me you're not working with the Americans. - What're you talking about? - You think I'm a fool? They just penetrated the compound a little too easily. Two men are dead. I've heard the rumors. They're saying I'm un chivato. That I don't have the right to take my place at the head of my business again. That I betrayed my friends. I would never... And then you get to keep all the profits for yourself. You said it. You want to retire. Well, tonight, my friend, is a night of reckoning where I take care of all my enemies. What are you saying? Carlo... Carlos! Carlos! Get the picture now? Your Bryan Mills created all of this. It is because of him that all these people here have become liars and traitors. This is what happens when you betray me. Get out! Get out of my house now! Asha. - We're gonna need back up. - On our way. Stop. I got him, go! No, no. The Mexican military are coming. - How long? - Maybe five minutes. - The ambassador is aware. - I'm on the southwest corner of the compound. - Now I need access. - To the compound? The ambassador has to make sure that I've got a military escort. - I've gotta protect my men. - Copy. - Make it happen. - Copy that. And make it clear I want the team out of there alive. Once they are out, there is no turning back. Be sure they know that that's an order. Mejia! It's over. Let her go. Me or her. Make a choice. - You're all right. No, quiet. - Bry... - Kill him. Go. - Shh, I got you. Got a text from the boss. We're out of here. Now. We're moving out. You first. Cover the exfil. Quickest route. Single shots only. Standby. On my signal. No. No, no, no. No, you don't give up. Whatever happens, you have to fight. You have to live. He will never hurt you again, I promise you that. - Don't you let her go. - Come with us. - Mejia can wait. - No. This ends now. Move now. Back way. We're clear. Copy. I'm on my way. They need a medevac helo now. On it. There's an entire regiment of Mexican soldiers - surrounding the place. - Are they out of there? Not yet. Not all of 'em. Guess who's still in there? Put your weapon down. Bryan, drop your weapon. That is a direct order. Medevac's inbound. We're two minutes out. Focus on me. Help is on the way. Just stay with us. Here comes a bird. I'm gonna be with you all the way, okay? Easy now. Put your weapon down and raise your hands up or you will be shot! Bryan, this is your last chance. They will take you down. There is nothing I can do about it. Bryan! I surrender. Good-bye. No! Secure the area. Stand down. Move. Move back! Move back! - Let me through. - Stay back. - Let me through. - Stay back. Let me pass. He's a U.S. government agent. Stand down. Move back. Move back! Stand down. Stand down. He's ours now. I'm sorry about Bryan Mills. Okay. You want the truth? Your people got in the way of a Mexican government operation. That you called in when you thought we'd succeeded - where you had failed. - It was the right move. And I happen to know the Security Council will see it that way. Your man made a mockery of international law. To save a hostage. To rid the world of a monster. So you approve of what he did? I admire it. And so should you. You know that operation you had going on in Juarez? Setting up an agent to sell arms to a cartel rival of Mejia's? You have no proof of that. Let's see what that excuse gets you when I bring it up to the Security Council. Talk about breaking international law. What do you want from me? I want you to beat every bush - and turn over every stone in Mexico. - For Mills? You think he's still alive. If not, I want his body back. What do we hear? Boss talked to the Mexican ambassador. Said he doesn't know anything. Yeah, nobody knows nothing. - Figures. - What about their military? Our military? They got nothing to say? Radio silence. He's just... What happened at the SSC? Are they looking for Bryan? They don't wanna even acknowledge him. They just want the whole thing to go away. So what, - didn't happen? - It wouldn't be the first time. - You all know that. - He could be alive. We should have gone back right then. - We made the wrong call. - I made the call. It's on me. We all know how this works. I could have lost all of you, and that would have been unacceptable. You weren't going back in there. Bryan would have gone. Yes. Yes, he would have. - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com -
