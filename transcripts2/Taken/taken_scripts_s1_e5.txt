 Vegetarian or carnivore? Vegetarian. Thank you. Shall we? A weekend meeting off book? What do you need, Tracy? What if I were to tell you a conglomerate of bankers are about to take down the economy. That the Dow, NASDAQ, long bonds are all about to drop 80% in the blink of an eye? Total collapse. Panic on the streets. Law and order in flames.

 And by the way, almost certainly the end of this President. What if I told you the person who wrote the code for that has, at the last second, decided to sell to the highest bidder? Well, then my guess would be that someone in the Attorney General's office made that bid. You? For the code plus the full list of conspirators. I need it to brief the President. No. Not yet. Just you and I on this until I announce the indictments. Tracy, I can't not brief her. It's my job. Let me stop you there for a second. Pretty sure there's some details of what you and your people do

 that you don't disclose to the President. You're the Associate Attorney General of the United States. What the hell are you doing? What possible reason could you have - to force my hand on this? - That was the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense who, if I'm not mistaken, you left dead on a Park Bench with a bullet in his chest. Come judgment day, who pays for all your sins, Christina? This guy? Bryan Mills. Seller's code name is Midas. Of course it is. - _ - 48 hours from now in Zurich, at 5:00 P.M. local time, Midas will hand your man Mills a package. - What kind of package? - Portable. That's all I know. Per Midas' instructions, Mills will be at the Brungasi drinking fountain unarmed, no phone, nothing. He will wear a white t-shirt, blue shorts, red running shoes. Midas will know who he is. He will not know who Midas is. - What does he look like? - No idea. Our communications have only ever been via encrypted email. Midas will approach if and when he feels it's safe. If he does not feel safe in any way, the deal is off. So Mills needs to be alone. This has a bad smell to it, Tracy. I really hope, for your sake, you know what you're doing blackmailing my team to do your dirty work. The package will be sealed, and it cannot, under any circumstances, be opened by anyone but me. My best to Gabby and the kids. Anything? Nothing so far. Stand by. That could be Midas on the approach now. The cab! Somebody call an ambulance. Now. Take this. Tell him I'm sorry. Tell him good-bye. Package is gone. Package is gone. And Midas is dead. Sending now. - You okay? - Fine. Boss there? In a meeting. - Fix it. - Believe it or not, I don't just snap my fingers and make things happen... It all happened, what, less than an hour ago? Yeah, and your guy Midas brought fleas. I'm not leaving my people in that mess for another second. You'll do whatever it takes. All Bryan Mills has ever - done is serve his country. - Which is all I'm asking him to do now. Or what, you'll blow his cover? Compromise me and my whole team? Really? What are you not telling me, Tracy? Just get it done. Thank you. She is back. Hey. Hi, Elena. I'm making salad. - You want any? - Sounds lovely. Let me just... Yeah, yeah. Whenever you're ready. No hurry. New locks. Locks, alarm, everything. Know a guy who knows a guy? Who is the guy, I think. - Handy. - Right? Yeah. My god, what happened? Nothing, it's just a scratch. Let me see. It looks a little more than that. - What are you, a doctor? - I used to room with one. Come... come on. Sorry, hold on. He's not taking any chances, is he? Let's take care of that. Thank you. The key card that Midas gave Bryan is registered to a private bank. 907 Lowengasse, Zurich. Bixel and Fangor Bank. Bravo team is already in position. Sierra, I need you to move to the southeast corner of the bank. Alpha's on the ground. What are the hours? Closed at 5:00. They reopen at 10:00 A.M. tomorrow by appointment only. There a diplomatic way in? You mean like "Guten Abend, Herr Fangor or Bixel"? You done? Diplomatic approach won't fly with the Swiss. Take all the chocolate and cheese you like, but don't mess with our banks. Now I'm done. Here comes Pablo. I need a picture. Get me a picture. Come on, darlin', no more selfies. Darlin'? Delta on the switch. Target is 20 yards away. You want to take him, now's the time. Zero. Wait out. Observe only. He just entered an apartment building. 53 Ellingasse. How long we been sitting here? Four minutes. That's two minutes too long. Let's roll. - What? - Who? It can't be. - He's supposed to be... - What? Byron Caine. Killed in '08, working ground force for Langley during the Taliban attack on the Serena hotel. So we have a ghost. Info Langley, see if they can't shed some light. Action is ours until further notice. Do not disclose where. Thoughts. Ideas. When they killed Midas, they must have got something connected to this bank, like say, a safe deposit box key. So we wait until morning. Caine and company go in the bank, get whatever it is they're after, we hit 'em on the way out. And risk it going away? Or better still, we move in now. Move in where? Inside the bank. Tonight? That's nuts. Nuts? I've got a sister and nephew that lost everything in 2008. House, marriage, truck. They're just getting on their feet again now, and there's no way I'm gonna let that happen again. So you're damn right that's what I'm saying. Nuts? What, you never robbed a bank before? Bank was built in 1882 by Hans Bixel the something with Italian granite 3 feet walls. Local S-Bahn train passes by 20 yards away every six minutes. - We use the train noise as cover. - You done this before? We don't talk about that. Now, the vault's in the basement. We're gonna go through this west foundation wall here. Built by the folks next door in 1804, therefore not Italian granite and 15 inches thinner. How do you know all that? 'Cause it's on the schematic right here. I mean, how do you know it's not granite? 'Cause Italian granite wasn't used this far north till they built the Fréjus tunnel through the Alps in 1871. You're making that up. No, he's not. - I looked it up and told him. - Thanks, Riley. How we gonna do that? - Do what? - Get through the wall. Hold that thought. What you got for us on the vault there, Faaron? Built in 2014, Swiss Engineered, 6 feet of steel on every side. Bomb proof. Wired to the hilt. Only way in is through the door, which you can't do without the bank's co-owner Otto Fangor. Ja? Guten Abend, Herr Fangor. Now all we need is a cherry on top. You're enjoying this, aren't you? We can't just walk into that bank after hours, - us and Mr. Wanger. - Fangor. Without arousing the suspicion of our tourist friends. - Correct. - Thought we were punching through the non-Italian granite wall. That's gonna be our way out after we exit the vault. Come on. Try to stay with me here, boys. Now, where's that cherry at? Stephan Yusic, former Bosnian Serb army officer. Now a crime boss and one of the bank's biggest clients, with after-hours privileges. Got a 20 on him? We've located his phone at a high-end spa on Kuttelgasse. Who you are? You have any idea who I am? Yeah, we know exactly who you are. How you like that for a happy ending? Just nod. So has he done it before? What? Rem. Rob banks? Why, you got a problem with that? No. - Are you... - Hey. He's also an amateur magician, and he grew up riding rodeo. What makes you tick, Bryan? Excuse me? What gets your blood flowing? I don't know. The ocean, I guess. The ocean? In the boat with my old man. Whatever. I just figured it was time someone tried to pry you open a little. Pry me open? Yeah, like it or not, you're family now. Me, I think it helps to know a thing or two about the guys who are meant to have my back. Here he is, the bank manager. Herr Yusic. Needs to make a deposit. Put your seatbelt on. What'd I tell you? Not granite. Stephan Yusic, and one of the owners of the bank. We have the safe deposit box key. We should move in now. No. We wait till they come out. I need the box number that goes with this. Box 518. Come on. No phones or weapons. If the machine detects either, it automatically disables the vault entry system for four hours and alerts the police. Please. Now, you have ten minutes. After that, the vault closes and relocks. Sit down. I must also tell you that because the system knows we are here and every box transmits a signal to the master control panel, a box must be opened within 90 seconds. Do it. Now. Down. Down! You must wondering how I got this in, right? You're a very important client... With a tiny little light switch. Box 518. Herr Fangor, bitte master key. I don't have it. Herr Bixel has it. So what is the plan? Okay. Fire in the hole. All call signs, this is X-ray. Hand me the gun and fall on the floor. Now. On the floor! Alpha, stand by. We have a situation. Roger. Standing by. I assume you're here to open box 518? Move. - Zero, this is Alpha. - Zero send. I'm moving to the bank via the bakery now. Go ahead. Let's go. Move. They've been in there for 15 minutes. Maybe we should move in. Something is going on in the bakery behind the bank. Drill bit's getting too hot. It's gonna break right off. Move. Okay, I'm feeling it. Just about there. Whoa. Leave it. Leave it! On the floor. Go. Go on the floor! Easy. Easy. Hands where I can see them. What... what is this? What is this? Come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh. You there? - Yeah. - Hold on. There better be an alarm override. Yes. Tell him. There's... there's a keypad on the wall in my office. Otto Fangor. It's behind the painting of a fountain on the wall. You have two minutes to cancel the alarm. - What's the code? - It's 11007♪. I'm hit. I'm in the office. Don't move. Stay where you are. We're coming. Get me out of here quick. Alpha's hit. Moving now. Let's see what we got. This is Sierra. Vehicle in position. Move now. You can do this? I'm good. Let's move. Halt! Halt! - Alles ist klar. - Komm. Here they come. I need to get them away from the police, and then you take them. - What happened? - John took one in the side! Let's go! No pain. That's good. I don't think so. - How's the Alpha? - Not good. - How bad? - We're losing him. Can you get him to the X field plane? I don't know. His pulse is erratic. Get to the X field. No, we need to get him to a hospital. Do what she says. We got a tail. Stay with me, John. Turn it around. He's bleeding out. Stop! Let me out. You take care of John. I'll take care of the package. - Zero, this is Bravo. - Zero send. I have an idea. New plan. Wait out. Move! - We have friends in Zurich, right? - Right. Time to call a friend. There they are! And we're in business. - Sierra, this is Zero. - Sierra send. Take your next left onto Regauerstrasse, then four blocks later turn right on Alpenstrasse. Got it. Then left on Bederstrasse and left again on Pulaystrasse. - You get me that number. - +141. Stay with us. Come on, John. 904 Koeningstrasse. 3/4 of the way down on the right. Back it up. Back it... You owe me one, Christina. Shalom to you too, Avi. How are you feeling? Like some punk just shot me. Yeah. I know how that feels. You ready? Take me home, boys. The ocean? Really? You still on that? Yeah. Still on that. If I told you, you'd think I'm... Pretty sure that ship already sailed. Honestly... Nothing's ever gotten my blood flowing quite like combat. What part? Being a part of something. Fighting for something. You tell anyone I said that... Too late. Why'd you quit the army then? My sister. I quit for her. I know you hate me for what I did, and. I don't blame you. These are some dangerous people who were gonna kill me if I didn't cooperate. I was weak. And I just got in way over my head. But these people will stop at nothing to stop your case against them. Including blackmail. And after you ended our relationship for the sake of your wife and children, I fell apart. I admit it. I became angry, bitter, and vulnerable. And I want you to know that if you hate me for making this tape without you knowing, I hate myself more. But you have to, have to believe me on my mother's life that this is the only tape. There are no copies. And now that I've had time to think about it, I decided that the right thing to do is to give you and not them this tape. Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin. Bye, Tracy. Good luck. Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin. Bye, Tracy. Good luck. You told us we were gonna recover vital data that could save the economy. Yes. Did you know about this? You mean, did I lie to you? We nearly lost John for a sex tape? This work we do takes a special kind of person, a unique sense of teamwork, and complete trust in each other. I would never, ever send any of you into a situation without giving you all the information you need. Did this mission come from the President? You do report to the President, right? Does she even know about this? No. What are you not telling me? I did not lie to you, Bryan. You were lied to. If I was, then that's my problem. Tracy. Christina. Is that how you found it? I believe it was originally in an envelope. I expressly told you not... Your personal life is of no interest to me. Does the President know? No. Add it to the list, I guess. Thank you. What, for saving you or the economy and the President? Please tell me it's the latter, because I nearly lost a man in Zurich. - You have to understand... - No, I understand perfectly. You're a cheat and a liar, among other things... Weaknesses these bankers hijacking our economy were hoping to exploit to blackmail you, to force you to drop your case against them. The Associate Attorney General of the United States, the third most powerful law enforcement officer in the country. And the sad part is... You know what the sad part is. But now because you lack the courage to be true to yourself, a young man is dead. - Wait. - No. I am not finished. I also understand that if any of this were to come out, you're in the scrap heap and your entire case against these bankers and their financial coup is over. So here's what you're gonna do. In a moment, you are going to inform this Security Council of your plans to immediately move forward on these indictments and you are going to make damn sure that the blood spilled in Switzerland was not in vain. And then you're gonna tell Gabby the truth. Gabby? Gabby. Penny for your thoughts? Hey. Let me get that. How was your trip? You know. Work. Right. How are you? Were you in Switzerland? There was a video online. I think it was you helping some guy who'd just been... Are you serious? But then they took it down really fast like it was never there. How did you see it? You're barely recognizable. How did you see it? Guy at work, news junkie. Kind of his job to troll the Internet. You okay? Do you have any idea what you're getting into here, Asha? You make me feel safe. I can't talk about my trip. I know. Hey. Could you turn that up, please? - Sure. - Do you mind? Good evening. Thanks for coming, everybody. Today's action is the culmination of two years' worth of work that are leading to the indictments that we're announcing... Please. Found him. - Synced and corrected by medvidecek007 - - www.addic7ed.com -
