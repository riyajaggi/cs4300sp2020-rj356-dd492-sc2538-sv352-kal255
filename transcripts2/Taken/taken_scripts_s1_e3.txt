Confused. Oh. It's about that. Carlos Mejia. Actually, it's more about you, and why you even have the live feed to his cell. His cell at a government black site, by the way.

[Sighs] Where are you heading after this? - What? - Office? Court? Where? - Office. - How? - [Stammers] Bus? Train? - Train. No, not today. Today you stay away from public transport. We got a major terrorist alert in progress, and city's going into lock down. Even better, you call your office and you tell them you're not coming to work. - You stay here. - Like an attack? - You'll be safe here. - What kind of an attack? Look. I-I have to go. Asha, I...

According to FBI Deputy Director Martello, the static surveillance cameras in Gwynn Oa... You all right there, boss? The cameras were hacked. Yeah, I'm fine. Riley, go ahead. Ismat Zahad. He's 44 years old. Originally from Abbas, Iraq. Came to America with his wife, Yasmin, and son, Amir, in 2011. Over there, he was an electrical engineer. Here he fixes cars. He on the FBI watch list for a real reason? Or is he just another name they added to cover their asses? May, 2014, his cousin, Tala Zahad, blew himself up outside a Baghdad police station. - 17 Iraqis killed. - Last December, Zahad buys two semi-automatic weapons, legally. How close was he to this cousin? Abbas is a small town. They were both born and raised there. A year apart in age, according to the FBI.

Try to understand what it's like... The abuse, the insults, the threat of violence that we suffer every day on the street, the train. - I understand how hard that must be. - Do you? And how angry that must make you feel. [Sighs] Angry, yes, sometimes. Afraid, always. I know what you're thinking, but you're wrong. Ismat is not like that. He is a good man. Hard-working. A man of... - God? - And peace. Alhamdulillah. He owns two guns. It is our right to protect ourselves, yes? May I see them? - He bought them. - Legally. I know.

[Computer beeps] They don't look like Jihadis to me. [Tense music] [Muttering indistinct prayer] ♪ ♪ 2002 Crown Vic, Police Interceptor model. Car was reported stolen last week. And it's probably been compacted, or chopped beyond recognition by now. What's that? [Tense music] - A follow car? - Could be. ♪ ♪ It's got a rental QR code. Probably got some kinda tracking software on it, right? - That was my line. - Track it down, and find it fast. It's our only lead to Zahad.

But you see these edges? Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign. Usually. Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it. But now I do.

Who's now serving life without parole in maximum security. That's the special Agent Gilroy? Former Special Agent. You see that scar on his forehead? That's Reynolds' handiwork. Had him trapped in a barn outside of Baltimore, only Gilroy played him. Turned the tables. He's a master profiler, manipulator of the ego. When Gilroy gets out of the hospital, first thing he does is quit the FBI, where they still regard him as a hero. Ismat Zahad. We know you took him, so where is he? You made a serious mistake here.

[Grunts] [Growling] [Panting] ♪ ♪ - [Muffled shouting] - Get his chair! ♪ ♪ Mike Gilroy, the profiler? Is framing a man on the FBI watch list? - Ismat... - Zahad. To look like a terrorist? To commit a terrorist atrocity on American soil. Why would he do that? To force United States foreign policy back on war footing. - Mike... Mike Gilroy? - That's absurd. No disrespect, Christina, but it's just not possible. It's not. Can you be more specific about this attack? We believe it's a suicide bomb. Where and when? I don't know that part. I don't know that part. It was my job only to get him to the safe house. The others took him from there. - What others? - Again, I don't know. We worked in compartmentalized teams with separate responsibilities. It's called operational security. - And you believe him? - I'm afraid I do. So now my people are all over that safe house as we speak. ♪ ♪ Has anyone advised the President to raise the threat level? ♪ ♪ I just told you, this is not an Islamic terrorist attack, so we need to tread very carefully here.

We don't negotiate with terrorists. Another word from you, and he dies. 38.762844 North, 77.258686 East. - Fail to deliver Gilroy... - Northern Virginia. And the Muslim dies.

You're not gonna detonate that thing. ♪ ♪ You wanna know why I know that? - Get out of here! - The Quran forbids suicide. - Go now! Stay back! - And you are a man of God. - Stay back! - Say it. I'm warning you. [Screams and sobs] - Say it. - [Sobs and stammers] [Tense music] Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. [Sobs and sighs] I got a question. Do you believe in God? Yeah, me neither, for the same reason. See, to believe in God is not to believe in yourself, right? Come on. [Tense music] ♪ ♪ I mean, let's face it, if God created half of the crap - that you and I have seen... - You don't know what I believe. I know that you head up some kind of off-book government agency... That you operate, live, and breathe in the shadows, where there's no place for anything but self-belief. Do you believe it's right to frame Muslims - for terrorist acts? - We both know that the best way to fight terrorists is to act like one. ♪ ♪ Where are we going? Where there's no cell phone signal.

Tell me. ♪ ♪ When I was about your son's age, my dad was lost at sea for six days. I thought I'd never see him again. So I prayed for a miracle. - What happened? - Air Force Para Jumpers pulled him out of the ocean half-dead. Never forgotten those guys. Never will. Now hug the building and head for the basement. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Dramatic music] ♪ ♪ I know what the 90-second rule is. It's the time you need to run away - if you cannot defuse the bomb. - Come on. ♪ ♪ - Zero, this is Bravo. - Zero, sent. We're in the parking structure.

[Laughs] [Both laugh] I've been through Gilroy's financial records for the past two years. The last Saturday of every month since April 2015, he's had a 9:00 tee time at Annandale Golf Cub. I thought he lived in Baltimore. When you're the guest of the Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Defense... Keagy? Bert Keagy? He's been calling the shots on all of this? Never trust a man in a bowtie. What if this doesn't end with Keagy? What if it goes further, higher up? He's not gonna tell you that. This is a man who frames Muslims to force the President into another war. He's a fanatic. In which case, we need to send a message. A message? Coerce the President at your own peril. Post office on Northeast Cromwell, second floor... It's one of the corner offices we own around town. For what? If Keagy leaves us no other choice, the signal will be when I remove my ring. I can get someone else if you prefer. Let me know. [Ominous music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ [Tense music] ♪ ♪ Christina. This is all very cloak and dagger. "Has anyone advised the President to raise the threat level?" [Scoffs] That was bold, and a little reckless. - Are we alone? - You tell me. ♪ ♪ Why, Bert? Explain to me why. I work for the Secretary of Defense, a vapid puppet of the spineless President, who refuses to confront the increasing threat. Of Islam. Minneapolis is already another Kabul. Baltimore, Baghdad. Dearborn, Lebanon. Which American city is next? Ismat Zahad is an American citizen. What are we doing here, Christina? ♪ ♪ Do you honestly believe that you could stop us? That you could get in our way? Am I that weak to you? ♪ ♪ You see, people like you can't even begin to imagine what America really wants. The thousands of young men and women in this country who have no other future, because they actually don't want any other future than to go over there and lay down their lives for their country. Of course we're not alone. You are now standing directly in the crosshairs. - [Gunshot] - [Grunts] ♪ ♪ [Gunshot] [Casing clinks on floor] ♪ ♪ [Dramatic music] ♪ ♪ [Exhales] - Wanna talk about it? - No. What about Gilroy? FBI's problem now. Which means federal prison. With any luck, he'll get a cell next to Jim Reynolds. I'll take that hug now. [Sighs] What happened? Turned out to be nothing. - False alarm? - Yeah. Well, thanks anyway for letting me hang. It was sweet of you. I've been thinking about what you said. About Carlos Mejia. You're right. I'm finding it hard to let go. I understand. More than you know. Can I... Would you mind if I... - I'd like to help. - It's okay. I can get through it. Because this much I'm certain of. Cali wouldn't want you to do anything... - Dumb? - That would ruin your life. Right. It wasn't a false alarm, was it? I can't tell you what it was. What I can tell you is it's over, and you're safe now. Is that your way of saying I should go home? That's not what I meant. [Whispers] I'm teasing. Long day. I see you like to cook. [Sighs] When I get the time. Your fridge doesn't look like it's seen a grocery for a while. Busy few months. You got time now? 'Cause I'm starving. Let's do it. [Crickets chirping] [Sighs] How are you holding up? Uh, you know, one day at a time, and all the other sports metaphors. Plants could use some watering. We could use a drink. Yes, we could. [Sighs] Thank you. I, um... I have a favor I want to ask you, but... you're gonna think it's silly. Well, I-I could use a little silly just about now. Okay, well, more boring than silly. I'll take it. - I went to a doctor. - Are you all right? No... well, I-I don't know. Wait... no, I'm fine. Is that why you've been sitting out there for the last five minutes, debating whether or not to even come in and ask for whatever it is you're struggling with now? - I was on a call. - Okay. - No, I was. - All right, I said okay. I mean, if you don't wanna tell me... it was just a check up. - And? - [Sighs] - You're gonna think I'm... - Yeah, you said that already. Would you be my emergency contact? That's it? That's it. I, um... I didn't know who else to ask. Whatever you need... No questions asked. [Soft dramatic music] Because honestly, I don't... I don't think I could bear losing you too. ♪ ♪ - Amir. - [Both playfully grunting] Come on, get it. Watch out. [Laughs] Here, pass it back. ♪ ♪ Bryan! Come. ♪ ♪ Hi. Come meet my son. Amir. It's okay.
