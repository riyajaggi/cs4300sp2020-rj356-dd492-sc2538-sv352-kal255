 It just keeps coming down until it doesn't. Well, at least the secret caverns keep us safe from red claw. Which is good, since I promised your mom and dad I'd keep us safe from red claw. Yeah, and tonight they're keeping us dry, too. - Huh? - Look! The stone teeth are dripping. Let's see. Huh. Oh, dear. Now your tail is dripping. I gotta make it stop! Wait, chomper. ♪♪ Uh! Oh, no!

Ruby and me are really happy our families let us stay in the secret caverns. Mm-hmm. Especially with red claw and his fast biters scaring everyone in the mysterious beyond. Okay, so what's wrong with your cave this time? It's leaky. It's a cave. How bad can it be? Come on. I'll show you. The water started coming in during the big sky water last night.

If I could talk big, everyone would listen to me, too. That would be good. Oh. As long as the big isn't so big that you scare everyone. Like red claw? Yeah. Like red claw. This cave is too small. And this cave floor is too bumpy. This cave smell funny. Don't give up yet. I'm sure we can find a good cave. Good cave? I don't think there is such a thing. Hey, guys. You have to see this. This is what we have to see? I think we can all fit. Follow me. What is this place? It's a cave of many voices. Listen. Hello! Wow, a talk back. A big talk back. Howooga! Oh, no! What was that? Wow. That was some roar, ducky. Yeah. Even I'm impressed. Oh, I sound big now. Yes, yes, yes. If I can talk big in here, ruby, can you show me how to talk big in the great valley. You just think I talk big because I'm bigger than you. But if you were bigger than you, you'd talk bigger, too. Hmm? But then, it wouldn't be big to you. Then, can you try to help me talk big? Please? I guess I can try. Me great flyer! Wahoo! Tree stars! You know, all of this shouting is making me thirsty. And hungry, too. Don't look at me. Chomper. Out in great valley, me saw nest full of stinkily buzzing things you might like. Gee, that sounds great. Then let's go. Thanks, petrie. Those stinky buzzy things were spicy but good. Not sure me want to hear details, but you welcome. So, who's ready to go explore the cavern some more? Uh-uh. We're still eating, chomper. You flat teeth sure take a long time to eat. Say, chomper. Why don't you go on ahead and we'll catch up with you? Great idea, littlefoot. Where ruby and ducky? Ducky, I've thought about it and here's what I think. To talk big, you need to feel big inside. So if you can think big, you can talk big, too. I can think of big things. Like that tree. It is big. Good. Now, be the tree. I cannot be a tree. No, no, no. But you can pretend to be as big as the tree, right? Oh, pretend. I am a tree! Okay. Not that you're feeling big, let's talk big.

Hello, my friends. My friends, hello. Hi, ruby. Er ducky? May I have some tree stars? Oh, yeah, sure. Here. Hey. Are you trying to talk differently, ducky? Oh, yes I am. Oh, yes, yes I mean, yes, cera. Since I feel big now, I am going to talk big, too. Well, it might be more convincing if you were a little taller. She'll be taller one day. Guys. Guys! Guess what? I found a new cave to live in. Come on. You gotta see it. Gee, chomper. It's pretty nice. Yeah, for a cave. Don't you just love it? And best of all, no stone teeth! Sounds like someone else is in the secret caverns. Well, there's only one way to find out who it is. That hole spike made seems a lot bigger. That's the mysterious beyond out there. Oh, no. It's red claw. And f-f-fast biters. Let's go. We don't want them to see us up here. We can not lat those sharp teeth stay in here. No, no, no. Don't talk big now, ducky. - Whoa! - Cera! Hurry! This way! Hurry! H-how are we gonna get the sharp teeth out of the secret caverns? Well, we cannot lead them into the great valley, so we have to get them to leave the way they came. Right, spike. Then we can use the vines to pull rocks down and seal off the opening. Follow me. Whoa! Ow! Uh. N-now what? Maybe ruby and I could hold of red claw while you guys get help. Hold him off? Like an appetizer? Listen. We've gotta stick together. If only the cave of many voices could make our bodies as big as it makes our voices. Ducky, that's it! Remember how your big talk back scared petrie? Oh. M-m-me remember that. If we lead red claw and his fast biters toward the cave of many voices, we can go inside and make it sound like there are more of us. And bigger of us. We roar like we big and angry? No problem. Not problem for you. This way! Don't move. Red claw cannot see you if you're still. Yeah, but he can still smell us. Look! We are very close to the cave of many voices. We are! But the sharp teeth will see us if we go over there. They might not see me. I am small. Howooga! Howooga! That's ducky. She did it. Sharp teeth all confused. Now's our chance. Howooga! Howooga! Ducky, your big roars are scaring the sharp teeth. I may be little, but I can pretend big. Now we can all work together. It working. Fast biters run away! Chomper, you can speak sharp tooth. Tell red claw to leave, because a big and angry herd is on its way. Okay. We are big and we are angry! Yup. Yup. Yuuuup! Red claw run away! Red claw run away! Come on. We still have to close up that hole. Okay, everybody. Grab a vine and pull! Now that red claw's not here, this will make a great cave. Thanks for being so brave, ducky. Yeah. We never make it into cave without you sneaking in first. Sometimes being little is better than talking big. But I know I will always be big, in here. Yup, yup, yup.
