 BUT IT'S JUST THAT THE LAST TIME WE VISITED ONE OF MY RELATIVES... NOT THE COUSIN MILDRED THING AGAIN! AFTER ALL, SHE IS A WARTHOG. I WAS JUST POINTING THEM OUT. JUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL BE NICE. PUMBAA, IT'S ME! I EXUDE NICENESS. IT'S JUST THAT I WANT TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION, TIMON. UNCLE BOARIS IS A BIG DEAL HERE IN RUSSIA. HE'S THE PRINCIPAL DANCER AT THE ROYAL (indistinct) BALLET. OOPS! HE JUST MIGHT BE THE BESTEST BALLET DANCER IN THE WHOLE WORLD! WELL, PUMBAA, IF YOU WANNA MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON YOUR UNCLE, YOU'RE IN GOOD COMPANY! -I AM? -PUMBAA, HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN? I AM A MUSICIAN AND A TRUE MUSICIAN, SUCH AS I, ALWAYS KEEPS HIS CHERISHED INSTRUMENTS NEARBY. NOW WHERE DID I PUT IT? IT'S SOMEWHERE HERE UNDER YOUR BARBELLS AND MY LAWN MOWER AND YOUR BALL OF BARBED WIRE, MY BANANA PEEL COLLECTION, YOUR MELTING STICK OF BUTTER... (continues indistinctly)... MY TRICYCLE... (panting) YOUR ROLLER-SKATES. TIMON, EVEN IF YOU DON'T PLAY A SINGLE NOTE, MY UNCLE'S GOING TO BE THE KINDEST, SWEETEST, MOST GENTLEST WARTHOG YOU'VE EVER MET! PUMBAA-LA! I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU OUT HERE. ENTER, PLEASE. NEPHEW PUMBAA, YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT ME GIFT. BUT, A NEW MUFFLER I CAN USE. I VERY MUCH LIKE TO TIGHTEN IT AROUND MY HOOF. SO VERY, VERY TIGHT LIKE THIS, YOU SEE. IN ORDER TO KEEP MY DANCING HOOFS FROM GETTING CHIPPED. (chuckles) THAT'S NOT A MUFFLER, UNCLE BOARIS. THAT'S MY FRIEND, TIMON! FRIEND TIMON, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO BE MEETING YOU. OH, NO. THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE. OH, HOW GOOD IT IS TO SEE FAMILY. COME, GIVE YOUR UNCLE A HUG! YOU, TOO, FRIEND TIMON! YOU KNOW, HUGS REALLY AREN'T MY THING. DON'T BE SO SHY, FRIEND TIMON! (sighs) WHO CAN RESIST A DOUBLE HUG CLINCHER? (groaning) (enunciating) CA-VIAR. (scoffs) MUST BE RUSSIAN FOR BUG-LARVAE. MMM. (sighs) MY HOOVES ARE NOT WHAT THEY USED TO BE, PUMBAA. YOU'RE RETIRING? BUT ONE FINAL AND GLORIOUS BALLET SHALL I DANCE TOMORROW NIGHT! ROYAL DIGNITARIES AND DEVOTED FANS OF FAR AWAY COUNTRIES WILL COME. AS MY COUNTRY HAS DECLARED IT NATIONAL HOLIDAY FOR MY HONOR. ALL OF RUSSIA WILL BE WATCHING ME, PAY-PER-VIEW, OF COURSE. AND AFTER MY ENCORE, WE CELEBRATE! I MAYBE OPEN ONE PRECIOUS JAR FROM MY PRIZED COLLECTION OF CAVIAR. WOW! DO YOU ACTUALLY TASTE THOSE DELICATELY SALTED AND SEASONED FISH EGGS? FISH EGGS? (exclaims in disgust) YES, NEPHEW PUMBAA! TOMORROW NIGHT IS SO MUCH THAT SPECIAL! HOW GRACEFUL WILL I DANCE? I WILL BE KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AS FINEST BALLET DANCER IN HISTORY! (yelping) UNCLE BOARIS! (exclaiming) (thudding) (crashing) (woman screaming) (cat yelping) (tires screeching) (glass shattering) LOOKS LIKE HIS ENGLISH ISN'T THE ONLY THING THAT'S BROKEN. EVERYTHING IS BROKEN, INCLUDING MY DREAMS. MY FINAL PERFORMANCE WILL NEVER BE. OH, BOY! YOU MUST REALLY FEEL ROTTEN KNOWING YOU'RE GOING TO LET DOWN ALL THOSE DIGNITARIES -AND CZARS AND PRESIDENTS AND KINGS AND AMBASSADORS AND... -TIMON! BUT THINK ABOUT IT! ALL THE RUBLES THOSE BIG MUCKETY-MUCKS SHELLED OUT TO SEE THIS GUY, I MEAN, HE PUT THE "BOAR" IN BORISHNIKOV. BUT... WHAT TO DO? I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO. PUT MY STAR QUALITY, UNDENIABLE TALENT AND CROWD-PLEASING STAGE ACT TO GOOD USE. FREE OF CHARGE! -YOU? -OF COURSE! I STUDIED AT JULIAN! YOU MEAN JUILLIARD? NO, JULIAN. JUILLIARD'S COUSIN. (groans) WE MUST FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO PERFORM IN MY PLACE! BUT NOBODY CAN REPLACE YOU. PUMBAA-LA, YOU COULD DANCE FOR ME! ME? WAIT! ONE MINUTE, UNCLE BOARIS, I GOT IT! PUMBAA COULD DANCE FOR YOU! YOU LOOK LIKE HIM AND HE LOOKS LIKE YOU. NO ONE WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE! BUT I CAN'T DANCE! (scoffs) YOU ARE WARTHOG! BALLET IS IN YOUR BLOOD! DON'T YOU WORRY, UNCLE BOARIS. THIS PIG'S BEEN IN WORSE POKES THAN THIS. I'LL HAVE HIM ON HIS TOES BY TOMORROW NIGHT. UH, I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THIS, TIMON! PIPE DOWN, PUMBAA, I'M READING! LET'S SEE. FIRST POSITION, SECOND... AH! WE DON'T NEED THIS! HOW HARD CAN BALLET BE? JUST DO A LOT OF FANCY HOPPING AND PRANCING AROUND. GO ON, TRY IT! THAT'S IT! EXPRESS YOURSELF WITH A LOT OF... TWIRLY, SWIRLY, SPINNY THINGS. OOH! FEEL THE MUSIC. (crashing) UH, TRY TO FEEL THE MUSIC A LITTLE LESS. 1, 2, 3, 4... NOW FLY PUMBAA, FLY! 5, 6, 7... (screaming) (snarling) KEEP DANCING, PUMBAA! DOUBLE-TIME! THIS IS IT, PUMBAA! AND THANKS TO MY HARD WORK, DEDICATION AND EXPERT INSTRUCTION, YOU ARE LACED UP AND READY TO PERFORM! HOW ABOUT ONE LAST PRACTICE PIROUETTE FOR GOOD LUCK? (exclaiming) PUMBAA, PAL? SPEAK TO ME! I THINK MY LEGS FEEL KIND OF...BROKEN. WHAT? BUT PUMBAA, THE STAGE IS SET. CELEBRITIES ARE POSING, ROOT BEER IS CHILLING, CAMERAS ARE ROLLING. THE WORLD IS WAITING TO MAKE YOU A STAR! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? (audience speaking in Russian) Fan: BOARIS, WHERE'S BOARIS? (clearing throat) COME ON EVERYONE, PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER NOW! (playing off-key) (snoring) (crickets chirping) YOU KNOW, A FUNNY THING HAPPENED TO ME ON THE WAY TO THE KREMLIN. (continues snoring) HEY, QUIT "RUSSIAN" ME! (scattered laugh) I CAN'T BLAME YA! I'M JUST "STALIN" FOR TIME. AH! "STALIN" FOR TIME! WELL, DON'T BE A BUNCH OF RED SQUARES NOW. (chuckles nervously) (clears throat) (crowd cheering) HEY, THAT'S MORE LIKE IT! LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE BACK ON YOUR FEET, PUMBAA. Both: WOW! (groaning) THANKS, FRIEND. DON'T MENTION IT. (crowd cheering) THAT WAS INCREDIBLE. AND THOSE QUACK DOCTORS SAID IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO HEAL YOUR FRACTURED BONES, TORN LIGAMENTS, AND RIPPED TENDONS. SAY, HOW DID YOUR INJURIES HEAL SO QUICKLY, UNCLE? (chuckling maniacally) THEY DIDN'T. GET ME BACK TO HOSPITAL. (sighs) PUMBAA, THIS IS PERFECTION! THE MOST PERFECT SPOT TO RELAX. AND DO YOU KNOW WHY THIS IS THE MOST PERFECT SPOT TO RELAX? UH, COULD IT BE THE COOLING SHADE OF THE SHADY TREE? THE HAIR-TICKLING PLEASANTNESS OF THE SONG BIRDS AND THE REFRESHINGLY COOLIFIED SKY BLUE POND? EXACTLY, MY PORCINE PAL.
