 IT'S BESTEST BEST FRIEND DAY. COME AGAIN? BESTEST BEST FRIEND DAY, YOU KNOW, IT'S THE SPECIALIST DAY OF THE YEAR, SET ASIDE FOR BESTEST BEST FRIENDS LIKE US. HERE, OPEN YOUR PRESENT. OKAY, IF YOU INSIST. [GASPS] A MR. BUG JUICER! YOU LIKE IT? I LOVE IT, PUMBAA! YOU KNEW I WANTED ONE OF THESE! ALL THE VITAMINS WITHOUT THE EXOSKELETON. THIS IS GREAT! THANKS. ANYTHING FOR MY BESTEST BEST FRIEND! NOW WHERE'S MY PRESENT, TIMON? I CAN'T WAIT TO OPEN MY PRESENT! I'VE BEEN WAITED ALL MORNING. YOUR PRESENT. RIGHT. WELL... YOU DIDN'T FORGET BESTEST BEST FRIEND DAY, DID YOU? NO, NO, NO. OF COURSE NOT, PUMBAA! ABSOLUTELY NOT! HOW DARE YOU EVEN THINK SUCH A THING! SO WHERE'S MY PRESENT? YOUR PRESENT. RIGHT. WELL... I GOT YOU A VERY SPECIAL PRESENT, SOMETHING MUCH MORE SPECIALER THAN ANY NORMAL PRESENT. I GOT YOU UH...A...UH... THE HOLLOW ROTTING LOG! A HOLLOW ROTTING LOG? BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT ME LAST YEAR. RIGHT. LAST YEAR. SORRY. I... I MEAN, I GOT YOU A, ER, UH... A FUNGUS-COVERED BOULDER! BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU GOT ME THE YEAR BEFORE THE HOLLOW LOG. HOW ABOUT SOME DRIED GRASS? THAT WAS THE YEAR BEFORE THAT. -TREE BARK? -YEAR BEFORE THAT. -DIRT? -TIMON! YES? YOU DID GET ME SOMETHING, DIDN'T YOU? OF COURSE I DID, PUMBAA. IT'S JUST THAT, YOU KNOW, RATHER THAN SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND MONEY, I DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING REALLY, REALLY SPECIAL. WHAT'D YOU DO? WHAT'D YOU DO? I, UH, ER... WROTE YOU A POEM. OH, BOY, A POEM! WOW! WRITTEN JUST FOR ME BY MY BESTEST PAL TIMON! I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR IT! CAN'T WAIT, CAN'T WAIT! OKAY UH... HERE IT IS. MY BESTEST BEST FRIEND PUMBAA, BY ME, TIMON. AHEM. UH...THERE'S NO WARTHOG QUITE LIKE YOU, PUMBAA. I COULD NEVER FIND AS GOOD A FRIEND. YOU HAVE GOT TUSKS AND YOU SMELL. YOU ARE ONE-IN-A-MILLION. THE END. THAT POEM DIDN'T RHYME, TIMON. IT'S FREE VERSE. I DON'T THINK SO, TIMON! I THINK YOU JUST WROTE THAT POEM JUST NOW! I THINK YOU FORGOT BESTEST BEST FRIEND DAY! NO, I DIDN'T. YES, YOU DID. -NO, I DIDN'T. -YES, YOU DID. WELL, IT'S A DUMB HOLIDAY ANYWAY, AND YOU MADE IT UP! OH, ARE YOU SAYING YOU THINK IT'S DUMB TO BE MY BESTEST BEST FRIEND? AND WHAT IF I AM? THEN I DON'T THINK YOU'RE MY BESTEST BEST FRIEND AFTER ALL. WELL, FINE. THERE'S A WHOLE HERD OF WARTHOGS OUT THERE, PUMBAA AND I CAN EASILY FIND ANOTHER FRIEND AS GOOD AS YOU. YOU'RE ONE OF A MILLION. OH! IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU'RE GOING TO BE, THEN I'M GOING TO FIND ANOTHER MEERKAT THAT APPRECIATES BESTEST BEST FRIENDS. AND I'M GOING TO FIND ANOTHER WARTHOG EVEN BETTERER THAN YOU! HMPH! HAH! OH, WHAT MAKES TIMON SO SPECIAL, ANYWAY? ALL HE DOES IS SLEEP. HE JUST SLEEPS AND RIDES AROUND ON MY HEAD AND TUGS ON MY EARS WHEN HE WANTS ME TO GO FAST. WELL, I BET I CAN EASILY FIND ANOTHER BESTEST BEST FRIEND IF I JUST PUT MY MIND TO IT. PARDON ME. SORRY. DIDN'T SEE YOU. PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT. SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN CROUCHED THERE, ANYWAYS. YOU SEE, I COULDN'T SLEEP IN THIS MORNING. I'M RARELY ABLE TO SLEEP IN MUCH, SO I DECIDED TO TAKE A WALK. SURE, LOCALS ALWAYS OFFER ME RIDES, ELEPHANTS AND SUCH, BUT I JUST CAN'T STAND RIDING AROUND ON OTHER ANIMALS. I ENJOY WALKING, NOT HOLDING ON TO SOME STRANGE ANIMAL'S EARS AND TUGGING WHEN I WANT TO GO FAST. IS THAT SO? MM-HMM. ANYWAYS, I WAS WALKING ALONG HERE, AND I GOT A PRICKLY PIECE OF SOMETHING STUCK ON MY FOOT AND WAS TRYING TO GET IT OFF WHEN YOU CAME ALONG, AND... SAY, IT'S GONE! FANTASTIC! OH, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, MISTER... PUMBAA. MR. PUMBAA. YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME, UH... MONTY. SO, MONTY, HOW COME YOU DIDN'T ASK YOUR BESTEST BEST FRIEND TO HELP YOU GET THE PRICKLY PIECE OF SOMETHING OFF YOUR FOOT? TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, PUMBAA, I DON'T HAVE A BESTEST BEST FRIEND. IS THAT SO? TOO LARGE. TOO TALL. TOO STRIPEY. [SNORT] HMM. POTENTIAL. CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING? ACTUALLY, MY FRIEND, OR RATHER, POTENTIAL FRIEND, DO YOU MIND IF I ASK YOU THREE PERSONAL QUESTIONS? NOT AT ALL. FIRST QUESTION. WHAT IS YOUR NAME? BAMPU. SECOND QUESTION. IF SOMETHING WANTS TO EAT YOU, WHAT DO YOU DO? I RUN AWAY VERY FAST. GOOD ANSWER! NOW, THIRD QUESTION. DO YOU, OR ANYONE ASSOCIATED WITH YOU, CELEBRATE BESTEST BEST FRIEND DAY? NEVER HEARD OF IT. PERFECT. YOU'LL DO NICELY. MONTY! MONTY, WHERE ARE YOU? GET OVER HERE! YOU GOT TO SEE THIS! YES, YES, WHAT IS IT, PUMBAA? TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT I CAUGHT! ISN'T IT THE FATTEST, JUICIEST GRUB YOU'VE EVER SEEN? EEW! TAKE IT AWAY! TAKE IT AWAY! IT'S FILTHY AND REVOLTING! WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I MEAN IT'S OFFENSIVE! AREN'T YOU GOING TO EAT IT? EAT IT! YOU WANT ME TO EAT THAT THING? IT'S NOT EVEN COOKED! BUT IT TASTES LIKE CHICKEN. YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT? YOU MEAN... YOU DON'T EAT BUGS? NO, NO, NO, NO! I EAT FRESH FRUITS, NUTS, AND SOYBEAN PRODUCTS. EATING INSECTS GIVES YOU GAS. YOU DON'T HAVE GAS, DO YOU? WHAT'S WRONG WITH HAVING GAS? [PASSING GAS] WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT? TIMON. YEAH? EVER WONDER WHAT THOSE SPARKLING DOTS ARE UP THERE? BAMPU, I DON'T WONDER. I KNOW. WHAT ARE THEY? THEY'RE FIREFLIES... FIREFLIES THAT GOT STUCK UP IN THAT BIG, BLUISH BLACK THING. OH. OKAY. UH, BAMPU. WHAT? AREN'T YOU NOW GOING TO SUGGEST, IN A DROLL AND SIMPLE SORT OF WAY, THAT YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE BALLS OF GAS BURNING BILLIONS OF MILES AWAY? NO. WHY? SHOULD I? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? [SIGHS] ISN'T THERE ANOTHER WATERING HOLE, BAMPU MY FRIEND? I DON'T THINK I LIKE THE COMPANY. I'M THIRSTY ANYMORE, MONTY... MY NEW BESTEST BEST FRIEND. MONTY? BAMPU? MONTY, IS THAT YOU? BAMPU, IT'S BEEN YEARS! [CHANTING] HUGA-CHUCKA-HUG HUG, PIL, PONT, POO. WALLA-WALLA, WOMP WOMP, WILLA, WOP, WOO! HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA HA! SO WHADDAYA BEEN UP TO, MONTY? OH, YOU KNOW, THE USUAL STUFF, BAMPU. YOU STILL AN EXPERT AT MAKING THOSE FRUIT-NUT-SOYBEAN PANCAKES I LIKE SO MUCH? YOU STILL AN EXPERT AT EATING THEM? -AH HA HA HA HA HA! -HA HA HA HA HA! SAY, BAMPU, I'VE JUST GOTTEN AN IDEA. WHY DON'T I FIX YOU UP A BATCH RIGHT NOW! THAT SOUNDS GREAT, MONTY. LET'S GO. YOU KNOW WHAT, TIMON? WHAT'S THAT, PUMBAA? I DISLIKED MY NEW BESTEST BEST FRIEND. WELL, IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER, I DISLIKED MY NEW BESTEST BEST FRIEND, TOO. SAY, TIMON, DID YOU OR DIDN'T YOU FORGET BESTEST BEST FRIEND DAY? WELL, PUMBAA, THE TRUTH IS... OF COURSE I DIDN'T. OH, BOY, I KNEW YOU DIDN'T! I KNEW YOU DIDN'T, TIMON! THAT'S WHY YOU ARE MY TRUE BESTEST BEST FRIEND. SO WHERE'S MY PRESENT? UH...CLOSE YOUR EYES. THE EYES ARE NOW CLOSED! YOU CAN OPEN THEM NOW. A MR. BUG JUICER? YOU LIKE IT? I LOVE IT, TIMON! HOW POETICALLY IRONIC IT IS THAT YOU GOT ME THE EXACTEST SAME THING I GOT YOU. WELL, LIFE'S A CRAZY THING, PUMBAA. SO WHAT ARE YA GONNA DO WITH THE MR. BUG JUICER I GOT YOU? WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING, BESTEST BEST FRIEND. WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING. [SNORING] [RUMBLING] HUH? OH, NOT AGAIN. AAH! HA HA HA HA!

THERE'S THREE OF US, PEANUT-BREATH. WE COULD PLAY ONE-ON-ONE-ON ONE. ZIP IT. YOU'RE CATCHING. EINSTEIN, YOU'RE PITCHING, BECAUSE THE NAME OF THE GAME TODAY IS BASEBALL. OKAY, EINSTEIN, HOW'S ABOUT GIVIN' ME ONE OF YOUR FAMOUS FAST BALLS? IS THAT THE SLOW KIND? NO... A FAST BALL WOULD BE A SLOW BALL, ONLY FASTER! NOW JUST THROW THE BALL!

AND I AIN'T NO GREAT NOTHIN'! THAT'S THE PROBLEM. PROBLEM? YEAH. I JUST SPENT THE MORNING SERVIN' AS A MAJOR-LEAGUE SCREWBALL TO THREE BAGGY-SKINNED BRUTES! I JUST FEEL SO... DEMORALIZED BY THE CROSSING OF YOUR PERSONAL BOUNDARY? NO. AIRSICK AND TIRED. YOU SEE, WHEN YOU'RE SMALL LIKE ME, YOU GET PUSHED AROUND BIG-TIME. PLUS, I CAN'T DO ANYTHING. I CAN'T FLY. I CAN'T SWIM. I WANT RESPECT. I WANT STATUS. I WANT... YOU WANT YOUR RAFIKI WISH, NO? EXACTLY. YEAH! WHAT'S A RAFIKI WISH? ALL THE CREATURES IN THE FOLD CARRY DREAMS WITHIN THEIR SOUL. RAFIKI GRANT THE WISH YOU TELL, BUT ONLY ONE... SO CHOOSE IT WELL. YOU GOT IT, HANDSOME. I WISH I WAS... SUCH A BIG HURRY FOR SUCH A LITTLE ONE. ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO TINK ABOUT IT? LET IT STIR WITHIN YOUR SPIRIT. MY SPIRIT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY STIRRED THIS MORNING, THANK YOU. AND I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I WANT. I WISH I COULD BE TALL LIKE THE GIRAFFE, SWIM LIKE THE FISH, AND FLY LIKE THE BIRD. WITH ALL OF THAT, I'LL GET RESPECT. YOU'LL GET STARED AT IS WHAT YOU'LL GET. RESPECT, MY FRIEND, DOES NOT COME FROM SIZE OF BODY OR CLEVERNESS OF SKILL. RESPECT COMES FROM BEING NOBLE WITHIN. PLEASE. COME ON. YOU SAID ANY ONE WISH. VERY WELL. GREAT KINGS AND WARRIORS PAST AND CURRENT, THIS FELLOW IS A SIZE THAT HE WISHES HE... WERE-ENT. [WHISPERING VOICES] GRANT HIM STEALTH OF A BIRD AND THE MOVES OF A FISHY, THE STATURE OF A GIRAFFE, FOR IT IS HIS ONE WISHY. IT WORKED! LOOK... IT WORKED! YES. IT'S DEFINITELY A PIECE OF WORK. ALL RIGHT, COME WITH ME YOU CRAZY-LOOKING TING. READY? READY. DEN OFF YOU GO! HA HA HA! NOW, GO, GO, GO, YOU SILLY TING! FIND YOUR DREAM. FIND YOUR HAPPINESS. FIND YOUR RESPECT! HA HA HA HA HA! [SCREECHING TO A STOP] HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA! SEE? I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T CLOUD COVER! I SAY, WHO HIT YOU WITH THE UGLY STICK? I SUGGEST YOUSE TWO PAY ME A LITTLE MORE RESPECT! WHY SHOULD WE PAY YOU RESPECT WHEN WE CAN GIVE YOU GRIEF FOR FREE? YOU KNOW, COME TO THINK OF IT, HE IS PRETTY... IMPRESSIVE. I JUST THOUGHT A CREATURE WITH HIS OBVIOUS SKILLS WOULD BE PUTTING THE MANEUVERS ON AMATEURS LIKE US. INDEED! WHY, I WOULD ASSUME HE WOULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS. HA HA! YES. OH! OR YOU MEAN LIKE THIS. I COULD DO THAT. THAT'S NO PROBLEM. OH... YEAH, YEAH! SEE? HA! GEE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE WERE WRONG ABOUT YOU. OH, YES, INDEED. WHY, I WAGER YOU COULD PROBABLY EVEN DO THIS. OR EVEN THIS. UH, ME? UH, SURE. I COULD DO ALL THAT. JUST TRY THIS ONE. [SOUND OF PLANE BEING SHOT DOWN] EEEIIII! WELL, I'D TRY IT, BUT I DON'T THINK I'D LIKE IT. HA HA HA HA HA! HA HA HA! NOW THIS IS MORE LIKE IT. HAARRRH! HA HA HA HA! FINALLY, A PLACE WHERE I GET THE RESPECT I DESERVE. WHOOOAAH! A PLACE WHERE I CAN DO THE GAME PLAYIN'. OH...OH...OH... PLEASE, SIR, DON'T HURT ME. AND WHY NOT? YOU CHALLENGED ME WITH A DIRECT ASSAULT ON MY EMINENCE. NO, NO. I DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR YOUR EMINENCE. YOU KNOW WHAT GUYS LIKE ME DO WITH GUYS LIKE YOU? WE...PLAY...BASEBALL. AH! HOME RUN. WHOA! THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR POWERS... PLAY BALL? SEEMS TO ME YOU NEED A STRIKE IN THE FISH TAIL, I TINK. OH, NO, I'M JUST... JUST ABOUT TO BECOME WHAT YOU SOUGHT TO CONQUER. LET THE BASEBALL GO. SO, NOBI, FRIEND, HOW DO YOU FIND YOUR JOURNEY TOWARD RESPECT? AW, IT'S GREAT. YOU KIDDING? IT'S A LITTLE LONELY, BUT, UH... I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. NOBODY PUSHES ME AROUND ANYMORE. THAT'S FOR SURE. IT IS EVERYTING YOU WANTED... SIZE AND POWER? ARE YOU KIDDIN' ME? IT'S GREAT! WELL, GOOD! BECAUSE HERE YOU ARE. WHAT? WHADDAYA MEAN, HERE I ARE? COME OUT, COME OUT, WHEREVER YOU ARE. MAYBE HE'S AT LUNCH? MAYBE THAT WOULD BE YOU? PUT...DOWN...MY... HOUSE! WHAT IS IT? IT'S OUR BASEBALL, AND HE'S GOTTEN BIGGER.

YAKATOI! SABU! EH! EROH! THANKS, RAFIKI. YOU SHOULD SEE MY HALF-TIME SHOW. WHAT IS THE MATTER NOW, MY FRIEND? INSIDE, I... I WAS STILL JUST AS SCARED AS I WAS WHEN I WAS A MOUSE. I'M NOTHING BUT A BIG, UGLY NOTHIN'. UGLY? NO. WISER? YES. AND IF YOU PREFER, YOU CAN RETURN TO YOUR OLD SELF. BUT I ONLY GET ONE WISH, HUH? I WOULDN'T BE GRANTING ANOTHER, JUST TAKING BACK THE FIRST. I CAN DO DAT. IT'S IN THE HANDBOOK. RAFIKI, I'D LIKE TO BE THE WAY I WAS. WRONG, NOBI, FRIEND. NOW YOU WILL KNOW THAT NEITHER SIZE NOR SKILL ALONE CAN BRING YOU RESPECT. IT MUST COME FROM WITHIN. THANK YOU, RAFIKI. WELL, NOW THAT YOUR MONKEY FRIEND IS GONE, WE CAN GET BACK TO THE TASK AT HAND. AND I THINK I'M IN THE MOOD FOR A LITTLE BASKETBALL PRACTICE! NOW, LISTEN HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUSE WENT TO SCHOOL, BUT I AM NONE OF THE THINGS YOU THINK I AM. I AM NOT A BASEBALL, BASKETBALL, OR FOOTBALL, SO YOU CAN JUST FIND YOURSELF SOMEBODY ELSE TO PUSH AROUND! ON SECOND THOUGHT, DON'T DO THAT EITHER! GOT IT? UH...UH...UH... THIS ISN'T FUN ANYMORE. AND YOU MAKE A LOUSY BASEBALL! [TRUMPETS] TANKS, RAFIKI. YOU'RE WELCOME, MY FRIEND. YOU'RE WELCOME.
