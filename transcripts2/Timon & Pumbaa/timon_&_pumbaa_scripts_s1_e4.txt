I'M GONNA BE A MOMMY! PUMBAA, ONLY CHICKENS LAY EGGS. AND WHATEVER KIND OF CHICKEN IS IN THAT EGG, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY NOT... I REPEAT, NOT ITS MOMMY. MOMMY! SON! BROTHER.

THAT'S NOT YOUR FOOD, JUNIOR. THAT'S YOUR UNCLE TIMON. PUMBAA: ISN'T HE THE HANDSOMEST WARTHOG YOU'VE EVER SEEN, TIMON? AND HE LOOKS JUST LIKE ME. PUMBAA, NOTICE THE BROAD, FLAT HEAD? PUMBAA: YEAH. -LONG SCALY BODY? -PUMBAA: UH-HUH. CLAWED HANDS AND FEET? PUMBAA: YEP. -AND SERRATED TAIL? -PUMBAA: RIGHT. AND WHAT DOES THIS ALL ADD UP TO? PUMBAA JR.! NO! HE'S NOT PUMBAA JR. HE'S NOT EVEN A WARTHOG. HE'S A CHICKEN! AND AN UGLY CHICKEN AT THAT. AAH! GET THE UGLY CHICKEN OFF ME! GET THAT UGLY CHICKEN OFF ME! AW, WOULD YA LOOK AT THAT? PUMBAA JR.'s HUNGRY. OH-HO. OHH! ARE YOU GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO HUNT, MOMMY? ARE YOU GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO CATCH MY OWN SUPPER SO I CAN BE BIG AND STRONG AND BIG LIKE YOU? THAT'S RIGHT, PUMBAA JR., AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE. ALL YOU GOTTA TO DO IS WEDGE YOUR SNOUT UNDER A LOG LIKE SO, ROLL IT OVER. UNH UNH UHH, AND BREAKFAST IS SERVED. PUMBAA: NOW YOU TRY. AH. OH, FINALLY SOME PEACE AND QUIET... AH. WITHOUT THAT CHATTERBOX UNDERFOOT. AAH! MOMMY, I FOUND A BIG JUICY GRUB. BUT HOW COME HE LOOKS JUST LIKE UNCLE TIMON? HOW COME THIS GRUB I JUST GRABBED RESEMBLES UNCLE TIMON, MOMMY? I'LL TELL YA WHY, YA LITTLE CHICKEN-LIVERED DIRTY LITTLE... TIMON, WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE! YOU DON'T WANNA SET A BAD EXAMPLE. MOMMY, HOW COME UNCLE TIMON WON'T JOIN US FOR DINNER? HOW COME HE WON'T BE A PART OF THE FAMILY? HUH? HUH? HUH? HOW COME? HOW COME? HUH? HUH? HUH, MOMMY? HOW COME? [PUMBAA] YOU'RE UPSETTING PUMBAA JR., TIMON. COME ON. JOIN US FOR DINNER.

OH, OF COURSE. UH, YUBBA DUB DUBS, THANKS FOR THE GRUBS. YEAH, BOY! [PUMBAA] AH-AH-AHEM. TIMON, I DIDN'T PUT A FORK ON THE TABLE FOR NO REASON. YOU'RE SETTING A BAD EXAMPLE. [MUMBLING] SORRY. [PUMBAA] AND YOU SHOULDN'T TALK WITH YOUR MOUTH FULL EITHER AND DON'T PUT YOUR ELBOWS ON THE TABLE AND MAKE SURE AND CHEW YOUR FOOD 43 TIMES AND DON'T GO EATING YOUR DESSERT FIRST. YOU DON'T WANNA SET A BAD EXAMPLE. YEAH. [BURP] TIMON, WAS THAT YOU? YES. IS THERE A PROBLEM? I'M JUST GLAD PUMBAA JR. WASN'T AROUND TO HEAR THAT. WHOA. WHOA. WHOA. EXCUSE ME, MS. MANNERS. ARE YOU SAYING YOU HAVEN'T BELCHED IN FRONT OF PUMBAA JR.? OF COURSE NOT. BUT YOU'RE THE CROWN PRINCE OF BELCHING. YOU MAJORED IN GAS. NOT ANYMORE. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW THAT WE HAVE A KID. BY THE WAY, WHERE IS HE? WE'RE PLAYING HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK. WITHOUT THE GO SEEK PART. THAT'S NOT VERY NICE, TIMON. THERE YOU ARE, UNCLE TIMON. HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LOOKIN' FOR ME? DID YOU FORGET HOW TO PLAY HIDE-AND-GO-SEEK? DID YOUR BRAIN CLEAN FORGET HOW TO PLAY? LET'S PLAY US A DIFFERENT GAME. HOW 'BOUT TAG? OW! YOU'RE IT. WHY, YOU... [LAUGHS] FAMILY PICTURE. FAMILY PICTURE! LET'S JUST GET IT OVER WITH. [JR.] MOMMY, HOW COME UNCLE TIMON IS STANDING SO FAR AWAY FROM ME? HOW COME HE DOESN'T WANNA GET CLOSE TO ME? PART OF THE FAMILY. SCOOT IN CLOSER, TIMON. YOU'RE SETTIN' A BAD EXAMPLE. [PUMBAA] THAT'S IT. LITTLE CLOSER. OH, VERY GOOD. LITTLE CLOSER. OOH, WE'RE GETTIN' THERE. LITTLE CLOSER. A LITTLE CLOSER! THERE. PERFECT. [PUMBAA] OKAY, HERE WE GO. ON THE COUNT OF THREE. ONE, TWO, THREE. AAH! HE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU HAD A SMILE ON YOUR FACE. YEAH, SURE. THE OMEN'S NOT AROUND, IS HE? NO. HE'S BRUSHING LITTLE TEETH AND FLOSSING, TOO. DID YOU BRUSH AND FLOSS YOUR TEETH, TIMON? NO, I DIDN'T, PUMBAA. OOH-OOH, WHY NOT? BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NO WORRIES DAYS? HAKUNA MATATA? NOW WITH THIS KID AROUND, WE CAN'T BE OURSELVES ANYMORE. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T CARE FOR THE KID, IT'S JUST THAT WE USED TO GO HUNTIN' FOR BUGS IN ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT. NOW WE STAY HOME WITH JUNIOR. HE'S CRAMPIN' OUR LIFESTYLE. BUT THE TIME YOU AND ME AND JUNIOR SPEND TOGETHER IS AS GOOD AS ANY WE'VE EVER HAD. BUT HE'S NOT OUR KID, PUMBAA. AND AS MUCH AS YOU WISH YOU WERE, YOU ARE NOT HIS MOMMY. HE'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT KIND ANIMAL. HE CAME FROM AN EGG. HE'S AN UGLY CHICKEN. AND AS MUCH AS WE LOVE HIM, WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO RAISE HIM. HE NEEDS TO BE WITH HIS OWN SPECIES. WHAT'S THAT? NOTHIN'. IT LOOKED TO ME LIKE A THIN, FLEXIBLE SHEET OF MATERIAL MADE OF FINELY DIVIDED, COMPRESSED FIBERS AND USED FOR WRITING ON. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? IT'S JUST A PIECE OF PAPER. SEE? WAIT! [TIMON] DON'T READ IT! IT'S A LETTER FROM PUMBAA JR. "DEAR MOMMY, "HOW COME UNCLE TIMON IS SO RIGHT? "HOW COME I'M NOT LIKE YOU "AND I DON'T BELONG WITH YOU? "I'M GOING TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME "BECAUSE OF WHAT UNCLE TIMON SAID." [CRYING] SIGNED, "PUMBAA JR., THE UGLY CHICKEN." TIMON, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? [CRYING] I KNOW, AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT. HE CAN'T SURVIVE OUT THERE, PUMBAA. IT'S A RUGGED, DANGEROUS, CRUEL WORLD, AND HE'S JUST A LITTLE UGLY CHICKEN. HE'LL BE EATEN ALIVE. WE'VE GOTTA FIND HIM. [SQUAWKS] WELL, ACCORDING TO MY CALCULATIONS, WE'VE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE EXCEPT FOR RIGHT OVER THERE. -AW! -CAN YA BELIEVE IT? HE'S FOUND ANOTHER CHICKEN AS UGLY AS HE IS. AND LOOK HOW HAPPY IT'S MADE HIM. YOU KNOW, TIMON, YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT ALL ALONG. [PUMBAA] JUNIOR'S NOT A WARTHOG. HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE ANY TUSKS. HE SHOULD BE WITH HIS OWN KIND. ME AND MY TAIL ARE GLAD TO HEAR IT. BUT WE JUST CAN'T LEAVE HIM AND HIS LADY FRIEND OUT THERE ALL ALONE. I'D GET KINDA WORRIED ABOUT THEM. WELL, PUMBAA, DON'T YOU WORRY. I'VE GOT AN IDEA THAT'LL SET YOUR MIND AT EASE AND GIVE PUMBAA JR. AND HIS GIRL THE UPBRINGING THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MOMMY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT ME AND SHOWED ME AND LEARNED ME. YOU'RE QUITE WELCOME, PUMBAA JR. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH, UNCLE TIMON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU TAUGHT ME AND SHOWED ME AND... YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. SWITCH TO DECAF. I'LL MISS YOU, TOO. GO ON. YOUR PARENTS ARE WAITING FOR YOU. GOODBYE. -GOODBYE. -GOODBYE. SO LONG. HAVE A NICE LIFE, KID. THERE. DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER, PUMBAA? NOW JUNIOR AND HIS GIRL CAN BE RAISED AND NURTURED AND TAKEN CARE OF BY THE OTHER CHICKENS!

WHY THEY'RE... THEY'RE SKINNY, THEY'RE SMELLY. THEY'RE... WELL, JUST LOOK AT THEM. THEY'RE HYENAS. YES. I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN. STILL IT DOES SEEM PRUDENT THAT WE DISPOSE OF THEM IN SOME EXPEDIENT MANNER BEFORE WE SUFFER SEVERE STOMACH UPSET. PERHAPS AN ELABORATELY CONSTRUCTED RUSE, IN THE INTEREST OF OCCUPYING THEIR MICROSCOPIC MINDS. [BOTH] AGREED. [YELLING] WHOA-HA HA HA HA! -AAH! -AAH! AAH! WE HATE TO INTERRUPT AN INTELLECTUAL DEBATE. WH-WH-WH-WHO ARE YOU? AND WHADDAYA WANT FROM US, YA BIG... BIG, BOLD, BRAVE CHEETAHS? CHEETAHS? HOW KIND OF YOU TO ASK. WELL, HEY. WE'RE JUST HERE TO MAKE YOU HAPPY.
