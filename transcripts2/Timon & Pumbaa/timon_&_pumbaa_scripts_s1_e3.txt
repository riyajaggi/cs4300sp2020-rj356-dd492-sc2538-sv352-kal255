THERE IS NOTHING IN LIFE MORE SATISFACTIFYIN' THAN GORGING ONE'S SELF INTO A GLUTTONOUS STUPOR, RIGHT, PUMBAA? OHH! PUMBAA, ARE YOU OK? I'M JUST FINE, TIMON. UNH! PUMBAA, PUMBAA, PUMBAA, OLD BUDDY. SPEAK TO ME! [FARTING] HOLD THAT THOUGHT. WHUH! WUH! SAY, PUMBAA, YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD. AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU LOOK GREEN. I THINK MAYBE YOU'RE SICK. BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN SICK A DAY IN MY LIFE, TIMON. [SNORT] MAYBE I JUST ATE A BAD BUG. MAYBE YOU JUST ATE A BAD BUG? MAYBE YOU JUST ATE A BAD BUG? HEY, MAYBE YOU JUST ATE A BAD BUG. LET'S LOOK IT UP. OK, LET'S SEE HERE. OOH, HERE'S THAT PINK GRUBBY KIND THAT WAS LIKE EATING BOILED HAIRBALL LUMPS. ECH! OH! REMEMBER THIS ONE, PUMBAA? IT WAS LIKE EATING STALE, DECAYING MAGGOTS IN CLUMPY SLUDGE SAUCE. BLEH... OH, AND HERE WAS THE KING STOMACH-TURNER OF ALL. THIS ONE WAS DEFINITELY LIKE EATING STICKY, SLIMY, GLOPPY GLOOPS OF RAW, CRUSTY WHARF SCRAPINGS... REMEMBER? WHOA, PUMBAA, WHAT'S HAPPENING? YOU'RE GETTING WORSE! I THINK MAYBE I AM SICK, TIMON. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY, REALLY, TRUTHFULLY, GETTING SICK? THAT'S WHAT I SAID. YES. THIS IS GREAT! IT IS? DON'T YOU SEE? IF YOU'RE SICK, THAT MEANS SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AND CURE YOU AND MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER. SO? AND THE SOMEBODY WHO DOES THAT SHOULD BE SOMEBODY VERY CLOSE TO YOU, SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS YOU AND YOUR UGLY PERSONAL HABITS BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. YOU MEAN MY MOMMY? NO. NOT YOUR MOMMY. ME! YOU? FINALLY, A CHANCE TO REPAY MY BESTEST BEST PAL FOR ALL THE YEARS OF SELFLESS DEVOTION AND KINDNESS THAT HE'S SHOWN ME. THIS IS THE MOMENT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR, PUMBAA. I... TIMON... AM GOING TO CURE YOU! WHU... [BURP] ARE YOU SURE WE NEED ALL THIS STUFF, TIMON? MAYBE I JUST NEED TO BURP. MAYBE YOU JUST NEED TO BURP. HA! PUMBAA, LEAVE THE CURING TO YOURS TRULY, AND THE FIRST STEP TO CURING IS KNOWING WHAT IT IS WE NEED TO CURE, AND WE FIND OUT WHAT THAT IS BY MEANS OF EXECUTION. DON'T YOU MEAN A EXA-EXA-EXA-AH... EXAMINATION? AH-CHOO! NASAL PASSAGES CLEAR. BONES OK. AH! REFLEXES FUNCTIONING. OOF! STOOL FINE. ARGH! UGH! EH! [BOOM] BLOOD PRESSURE NORMAL. OOH! WELL, PUMBAA, I HAVE COME TO THE END OF MY EXAMINATION, AND AFTER MUCH HYPOTHESIZING AND CONTEMPLATING AND, UH, CONJUGATING, I'VE ARRIVED AT A DIAGNOSIS! SO, WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME? YOU'RE SICK. WUH! NOW ALL THAT'S LEFT TO DO IS CURE YOU, AND THEN YOU'LL BE ALL BETTER. SAY, PUMBAA, AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU GOT SICK SO I COULD TAKE CARE OF YOU SO WELL? OF COURSE YOU ARE! NOW, LET'S SEE. LET'S SEE. LET'S SEE. HOW AM I GOING TO CURE MY BESTEST BEST PAL? I KNOW, TIMON. MAYBE I SHOULD GO TO A LICENSED AND PRACTICING PHYSICIAN WHO IS A TRAINED AND EDUCATED EXPERT IN THE FIELD OF MEDICAL TREATMENT. WHAT? YOU MEAN A DOCTOR? NONSENSE! EVERYONE'S AFRAID OF DOCTORS, BUT, MY PEAKED PAL, I AM CLEARLY NOT A DOCTOR, SO, THEREFORE, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT... UNDERSTAND? NO. LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY, PUMBAA. MODERN MEDICINE IS ALL FINE AND GOOD AND WELL, BUT I SAY, OUT WITH THE NEW AND IN WITH THE OLD: MY GRANDMOTHER'S CURE-ALL BOOK, FILLED WITH THE CENTURIES' OLD TRADITION OF SUPERSTITION AND HOME REMEDIES. NOW, IT CLEARLY SAYS HERE "TO CHECK ALL THE WATERTIGHT COMPARTMENTS, MAKING SURE THE WELDS ARE SOLID AND WITHOUT DEFECT." CAN'T ARGUE WITH TRADITION. SAY, UH, TIMON, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE EXACT TITLE OF THAT BOOK?! OOPS! WRONG BOOK. AH, HERE WE GO! YES! HERE IT IS ON PAGE 3,324. GRANNY TIMONA'S ULTIMATE CURE-ALL. THIS SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

YOU KNOW, PUMBAA, I JUST GOTTA SAY HAVIN' THE CHANCE TO CURE YOU IS THE MOST WONDERFUL AND FULFILLING THING EVER TO HAPPEN TO ME. IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL ALL WARM AND GLOWY AND FUZZY INSIDE, KNOWING THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP MY BESTEST BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD GET BETTER. I MEAN, LOOK AT YA. WAIT. LOOK AT YA. WHAT HAPPENED, PUMBAA? YOU DIDN'T JUST BURP OR SOMETHING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN GET BETTER, DID YOU? WELL, ACTUALLY, UH... I MEAN, YOU DO STILL FEEL SICK, RIGHT? BECAUSE IF YOU AREN'T STILL FEELING SICK, IT WILL CRUSH ME EMOTIONALLY! OH...WELL... I MUST JUST LOOK BETTER. THAT'S ALL. BURP! YEAH. I STILL FEEL REALLY AWFUL INSIDE, SO YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND CURE ME IF YOU WANT. GOOD! NOW, OPEN THE HATCH. [GULP] THERE. FEEL BETTER, DON'T YOU? AHH, WHAT DID I TELL YA?
