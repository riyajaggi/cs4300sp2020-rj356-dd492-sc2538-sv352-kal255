GEE, I DON'T KNOW, TIMON. MAYBE THESE PEOPLE HAVE IMPORTANT JOBS WHICH CARRY RESPONSIBILITIES THAT AFFECTING LIVES OTHER THAN THEIR OWN. RESPONSIBILITIES? PUMBAA, THERE YOU GO MISCONSTROODLING EVERYTHING AGAIN. THESE PEOPLE CLEARLY DON'T KNOW HOW TO RELAX. TIMON, HAKUNA MATATA MIGHT NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE. PUMBAA, I SAY I CAN MAKE HAKUNA MATATA WORK FOR ANYONE, BUT WHY SHOULD I? THESE STRESS-HAPPY LOCALS HAVE NOT DIRECTLY AFFECTED ME, BUT THE MOMENT ONE DOES, I'LL GLADLY PROVE MY HAKUNA MATATA THEORY. OOF! MY TRUFFLE! TIME TO CHECK THE CLOCK. TIMON, I THINK HE DIRECTLY AFFECTED YOU BY MAKING YOU SMASH YOUR FAVORITE TRUFFLE. YOUR POWERS OF OBSERVATION ASTONISH ME, PUMBAA.

YO, HANS, YOU THINK YOU COULD SPARE A MINUTE? YOU GOT 60 OF THEM. [SIGH] I AM FRONK FIGNEWGON, KEEPER OF THE CLOCK. PLEASE DO NOT ASK ME TO SPARE A SECOND. MY TIME IS DEVOTED TO THIS CLOCK, WHICH IS THE PRIDE OF MY CITY, AND JOY OF MY LIFE. WHOA, FRONK, RELAX. YOU DON'T SEEM TO REALIZE HOW MY JOB CARRIES A RESPONSIBILITY THAT AFFECTS LIVES OTHER THAN MY OWN. WHAT DID HE SAY, TIMON? NOTHIN', NOTHIN'. SOMETHIN' ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. I WAS SELECTED BY MY FELLOW TOWNSPEOPLE TO CARE FOR THIS CHERISHED CLOCK, THAT HAS NOT ONLY KEPT THE TRAINS AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION RUNNING ON TIME FOR A CENTURY BUT HAS ALSO SURVIVED EIGHT FIRES, TWO FLOODS, AND THREE WARS. THE TOWNSPEOPLE RELY ON ME TO PRESERVE THIS LIVING MEMORIAL OF WHICH I AM THE PROUD TIMEKEEPER. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. WE GET THE IDEA! AND ALL IT TELLS ME IS THAT THERE'S ONE HUGE GAPING VOID IN YOUR LIFE. BUT I HAVE THE CLOCK. WHAT MORE DO I NEED? WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED? HAKUNA MATATA! WHAT A WONDERFUL... YOU'RE NOT GOING TO PERFORM AN ENTIRE MUSICAL NUMBER, ARE YOU? BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE TIME. I STILL HAVE TO RECALIBRATE THE MAIN SUSPENSION SPRING. WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT HERE IS... HAKUNA MATATA! IT MEANS LOOSEN THOSE LEDERHOSEN, LET DOWN YOUR HAIR, AND SEE THE WORLD THROUGH CARE-FREE COLORED LENSES! FORGET YOUR WORRIES! HAVE SOME FUN. TAKE A VACATION. EAT BUGS. KISS A GIRL! IT'S TRUE. I'VE NEVER TAKEN THE TIME TO KISS A GIRL. NEVER EVEN KISSED A GIRL. TSK TSK TSK! TIMON, YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M GOING TO KICK BACK, CUT LOOSE, AND KISS A GIRL! [PUMBAA] WHAT ABOUT THE CLOCK? BUT WHAT ABOUT THE CLOCK? WHAT? WHAT ABOUT THE CLOCK? YOU THINK THE MINUTE YOU WALK AWAY, THE CLOCK WILL BREAK AND MEAN OLD MISTER CLOCK INSPECTOR WILL DRIVE UP IN A BIG, BLACK CAR AND DEMAND IT BE FIXED BY NOON OR YOU'RE FIRED? [CHUCKLES] YOU'RE RIGHT!

ALLOW CLOCKWORK QUINT TO SAVOR THE MOMENT. EVER SINCE THIS MISGUIDED TOWN CHOSE FRONK TO BE TIMEKEEPER INSTEAD OF ME, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SWEET REVENGE. UNLESS THE CLOCK IS FIXED AND CUCKOOING BY NOON, FRONK FIGNEWGON IS FIRED. FIRED? HE'LL NEVER WORK ON CLOCKS AGAIN. HIS SONS WILL NEVER WORK ON CLOCKS. OR THEIR SONS NEITHER! HA HA HA! GEE, TIMON, I GUESS FRONK HAD MORE TO WORRY ABOUT THAN HE REALIZED. HAKUNA MATATA, PUMBAA. THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. WE CAN FIX IT. [CREAKING] UH, LET'S GET OUTTA HERE. WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG? TIMON, DON'T YOU THINK WE SHOULD FIND FRONK AND TELL HIM ABOUT THE CLOCK? BECAUSE IF WE DON'T TELL HIM ABOUT THE CLOCK, AND HE DOESN'T FIX IT, HE'LL GET FIRED. UGH! DOESN'T ANYONE AROUND HERE WEAR A WATCH? I THINK THEY ALL RELY ON THE CLOCK, TIMON! -YOU KNOW WHAT, PUMBAA? -WHAT?

FRIDA. I'M SO HONORED TO BE ENGAGED TO OUR TOWN'S TIMEKEEPER. I'VE CHERISHED THAT BIG CLOCK EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL. THE CUCKOO BIRD SANG ME TO SLEEP EVERY NIGHT, BUT I NEVER DREAMED I'D MEET SOMEONE WHO LOVED THAT CLOCK AS MUCH AS I DO. [FRONK] WITH YOUR LOVE, I'LL FINALLY PROVE TO CLOCKWORK QUINT THAT I AM NOT A FAILURE. WE'LL GET MARRIED AT THE CLOCK. OUR CHILDREN WILL GROW UP TO BE TIMEKEEPERS AS WILL OUR GRANDCHILDREN UND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN. [FRIDA] THAT CLOCK WILL KEEP PERFECT TIME FOR GENERATIONS OF CLOCK LOVERS LIKE US! WELL...AHEM! TELL HIM WHAT YOU WERE GOING TO TELL HIM, PUMBAA. BUT I THOUGHT YOU, THE BRAINS OF THE OUTFIT, WERE GOING TO TELL HIM THAT THE CLOCK BROKE. THE CLOCK IS BROKEN? BUT HOW? IT'S NOT EXACTLY BROKEN. IT COULD BE YOUR BASIC WEAR AND TEAR. THEN AGAIN, IT MIGHT JUST BE A SPRUNG SPIRO SPRING OR, UH, JUST A GLITCH IN THE GLOCKENSPIEL MAJIG. AND, UH, BIG DEAL IF YOU'RE FIRED IF THE CLOCK ISN'T FIXED BY NOON. IS THAT GONNA BE THE END YOUR TIMEKEEPING CAREER? YES! AND IT'S ONLY FIVE MINUTES BEFORE NOON. FOLLOW ME. [BOTH] WHOA! [BOTH] WHOA!

WHAT MOOK NEGLECTS A TEMPERAMENTAL PIECE OF MACHINERY LIKE THIS TO PICK UP ON SKI BUNNIES? THIS CLOCK HAS A HISTORY. DOESN'T THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU? WAIT ONE MINUTE! WHICH IS ABOUT HOW LONG WE HAVE TO LIVE. I'VE GOT AN IDEA. [QUINT] CONSTERNATION! COULD IT BE FRONK FIGNEWGON AND HIS BELOVED CLOCK WILL SOON PART COMPANY? MAYBE NOW THIS TOWN WILL PICK THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB, SOMEONE LIKE ME, CLOCKWORK QUINT! [CUCKOO] THE MOST PUNCTUAL TIMEKEEPING TIMEKEEPER IN THE ALPS. I'VE BEEN PREDICTING YOUR FAILURE FOR YEARS, AND TODAY... WHAT? CUCKOO. VEXATION! CLOCKWORK QUINT WILL GET REVENGE. CLOCKWORK QUINT IS... [CUCKOO] GRRR! CUCKOO.
