 IT'S LIKE A BUILT-IN SHOWER ON YOUR FACE. AND THE BIRDS RIDE AROUND ON NED ALL DAY LONG LIKE HE'S A BUS. AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE MAGNIFICENT YET STYLISH TUSKS. I'VE GOT TUSKS. QUIET, PUMBAA. I'M TALKING ABOUT NED. DID YOU SEE THAT? NED MOVED THAT GIANT LOG. CAN YOU DO THAT WITH YOUR TUSKS? NO. PRECISELY. NO WONDER EVERYONE LOVES NED AND HE'S THE MOST POPULAR GUY IN THE JUNGLE. WHY CAN'T WE ALL BE LIKE HIM? YOU THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BE LIKE AN ELEPHANT? PUMBAA, IS THERE SOME KIND OF THOUGHT BUZZING AROUND IN THAT WARTHOG SKULL OF YOURS? [BUZZING] [SLAP] I DON'T THINK SO. DON'T PLAY COY. I KNOW YOU, PUMBAA. TOMORROW AT THE CRACK OF DAWN, YOU'LL COME BOUNCING UP, ALL EXCITED ABOUT BECOMING AN ELEPHANT. NO, TIMON, I DON'T WANT TO BE AN ELEPHANT. I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY BEING A WARTHOG AND WOULD NEVER WANT TO BE ANYTHING ELSE. [PUMBAA] TIMON, TIMON, GUESS WHAT! I'VE JUST REACHED AN AMAZING DECISION ABOUT MY LIFE. OH? I DECIDED TO BE AN ELEPHANT. DID YOU KNOW THAT ELEPHANTS ARE NATURE'S MOST PERFECT CREATION? BLECCH! YES. I RECALL HEARING THAT SOMEWHERE BEFORE. OH, THEY'RE SO BIG AND LARGE, AND THEY GOT THOSE LONG NOSES. I BELIEVE IT'S CALLED A TRUNK? YEAH, YEAH. AND ON HOT DAYS I COULD SPRITZ MYSELF WITH REFRESHINGLY COOLIFIED WATER, AS I HANG OUT WITH ALL THE OTHER ELEPHANTS. I COULD MOVE BIG LOGS OUT OF EVERYONE'S WAY. PUMBAA. EVERYONE WOULD LOVE ME. I'D BE AS POPULAR AS NED. PUMBAA! SINCE WHEN IS BEING POPULAR A GOOD REASON TO DO ANYTHING? WAIT A MINUTE! POPULAR! I THINK YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING. I AM? BEING POPULAR IS THE BEST REASON TO DO ANYTHING. IF YOU BECOME AN ELEPHANT, EVERYONE WOULD LOVE YOU. THEN WE CAN BE PART OF NED'S CLIQUE. THE IN-CROWD, THE MOVERS, THE SHAKERS. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. DON'T STRAIN YOURSELF. ALL THAT'S IMPORTANT IS YOU WANT TO BE AN ELEPHANT, AND I'M GOING TO HELP YOU. GREAT! WHAT DO YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU THINK OF AN ELEPHANT? DON'T ANSWER. I'LL TELL YOU. SIZE, PUMBAA. SIZE! AS YOU ARE NOW, YOU ARE TOO SMALL TO BE AN ELEPHANT. DARN. BUT NO WORRIES. I'VE GOT IT ALL WORKED OUT. WE INCREASE YOUR DIET, BY THIS I MEAN THAT YOU EAT A LOT MORE, SO MUCH MORE THAT YOU YOU BECOME BIG AND FAT LIKE A BIG FAT ELEPHANT. TIMON, YOU ARE SO SMART. THANK YOU. NOW, OPEN WIDE. AHH. [MUNCH MUNCH SNORT] HEY, THAT WAS PRETTY GOOD. I THINK I'M GOING TO LIKE BEING AN ELEPHANT. YOU'RE NOT DONE YET. OPEN. AHH... [MUNCH MUNCH] AND AGAIN. TIMON! YES, PUMBAA? I'M GETTING FULL. PUMBAA, WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN. LOOK! GEE, TIMON... [BELCH] MAYBE BEING AN ELEPHANT ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL. MAYBE I SHOULD JUST BE HAPPY BEING MYSELF. POPPYCOCK. WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT, PUMBAA, BEING YOURSELF OR BEING POPULAR? THAT'S RIGHT. BEING POPULAR. IF YOU SAY SO. NOW, PAY ATTENTION. BEING AN ELEPHANT, OR PACHYDERM, ISN'T JUST ABOUT SIZE. IT'S ALSO A STATE OF MIND. AND ELEPHANTS HAVE THE GREATEST MINDS IN THE WORLD. AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW, ELEPHANTS NEVER FORGET. SO WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A REMEMBERY THAT WILL MAKE EVERY ELEPHANT, ESPECIALLY NED, SIT UP AND TAKE NOTICE. ARE YOU FOLLOWING THIS? I SURE AM. O.K., GOOD. NOW, WHAT DID I JUST SAY? YOU SAID, "O.K., GOOD." BEFORE "O.K., GOOD." I DON'T REMEMBER. WEREN'T YOU LISTENING? I HEARD EVERY WORD. BUT YOU DON'T REMEMBER. -NO. -THAT'S O.K. I SHOULDN'T EXPECT MIRACLES RIGHT OFF THE BAT. DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHAT REMEMBERING IS? SURE I DO. IT'S NOT FORGETTING. NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE. DO YOU THINK YOU COULD NOT FORGET WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY NEXT? -I DON'T KNOW. -WHY NOT? BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SAID IT YET. HOW CAN I NOT FORGET SOMETHING YOU HAVEN'T EVEN SAID YET? THAT WOULD BE LIKE BACKWARDS NOT FORGETTING. I DON'T THINK I COULD BACKWARDS NOT FORGET. OH, PLEASE, JUST TRY. O.K. I'M BACKWARDS NOT FORGETTING THAT YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY, "GOOD JOB, PUMBAA." -NO! -WHAT? I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO SAY, "GOOD JOB, PUMBAA." YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WAIT UNTIL I SAY THE THING I'M GOING TO SAY AND THEN REMEMBER IT. RECALL IT IN YOUR BRAIN. RETAIN IT IN YOUR MEMORY. THIS IS MAKING MY HEAD HURT. NOT AS MUCH AS MINE. SEE IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THIS. "MY NAME IS PUMBAA. I AM AN ELEPHANT." O.K. YOUR NAME IS PUMBAA, AND YOU ARE AN ELEPHANT. RRR! THAT TIME YOU SAID, "RRR!" -NO! -YES, YOU DID. I REMEMBER. PUMBAA, WORK WITH ME. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER SOMETHING ELSE. O.K. WHAT? AHH... REPEAT AFTER ME. "AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS." -SHOULD I REPEAT IT NOW? -YES. UH... WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN? AN ELEPHANT NEVER FORGETS! YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT. I DO IF I WANT ANYTHING TO SINK INTO THAT THICK SKULL OF YOURS. I'M BEGINNING TO I SEE WHY YOU'RE NOT VERY POPULAR. YOU'RE A GROUCH. AAH! AND YOU SCREAM LIKE A BABY. UHH! LET'S JUST COME BACK TO THE MEMORY THING LATER, O.K.? WHAT MEMORY THING WOULD THAT BE? GOOD JOB, PUMBAA. NOW WE COME TO THE FINAL SEGMENT OF YOUR TRAINING. SOON YOU WILL BE A FULL-FLEDGED PACHYDERMIS AFRICANIS, WITH ALL THE BENEFITS AND PRIVILEGES INHERENT TO THE SPECIES. AND WHO WILL YOU SHARE THOSE BENEFITS AND PRIVILEGES WITH? YOU, TIMON! GOOD. STEP UP AND RECEIVE YOUR OFFICIAL ELEPHANTLIKE TRUNK. O.K., UH, HOW'S THIS? AM I ALL SET? PERFECT. HOLD STILL. 1, 2, 3, GO! [STRETCHING] WOW. THAT HURT. HURT, SHMURT. PUMBAA, WE'VE DONE IT. WE'VE SUCCEEDED. YOU ARE NOT A WARTHOG, YOU'RE AN ELEPHANT... MAN? I DON'T THINK I LIKE THIS. WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? I'LL BE THE RIGHT-HAND MEERKAT TO THE JUNGLE'S NEWEST ELEPHANT. NO... PUMBAAPHANT. EVEN BETTER AND MORE POPULAR THAN AN ELEPHANT. LET'S GO SHOW NED. THIS WILL BE GREAT. HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE GLUM LOOK? I DON'T WANT TO DO IT. WHAT? PUMBAA, NO! LISTEN, YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS. EVERYONE'S NERVOUS THEIR FIRST DAY AS AN ELEPHANT. DON'T WORRY. WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO, MAKE FUN OF YOU? RIDICULE YOU TO TEARS? LAUGH AND POINT? I'LL BE RIGHT THERE WITH YOU. I'LL HELP YOU. YOU'LL DO FINE. WELL, O.K., IF YOU SAY SO. [TIMON] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! STEP RIGHT UP AND MEET THE NEW KING OF THE JUNGLE! THAT SOPHISTICATE OF SOPHISTRY, THE MOST POPULAR OF THE POPULAR CROWD, THE...PUMBAAPHANT! PRETTY GOOD, HUH? THE TRUNK, THE BULK. A MEMORY, TOO... OF SORTS. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SUCH AN OBVIOUSLY POPULAR AND VALUABLE ADDITION TO YOUR NED THE ELEPHANT CLIQUE? HMM. THAT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. THOSE AREN'T EARS. THEY'RE PALM FRONDS. AND YOU CALL THAT A TRUNK? HA! AND THE SUGGESTION THAT THIS OVERFED HOG EVEN COMES CLOSE TO APPROXIMATING MY MAJESTIC BULK IS NOT ONLY ABSURD, IT'S INSULTING. COME, MY COMRADES. LET US ENJOY A SHORT MOMENT OF LAUGHING AND POINTING AT THIS COMICALLY PITIFUL DISPLAY OF LOW SELF-ESTEEM. -HA HA HA HA! -HA HA HA HA! -AH HA HA HA HA... -HA HA HA HA... WELL, ISN'T THIS A PLEASANT TWIST? OUT OF THE WAY, TIMON! WE GOT TO SAVE 'EM! PUMBAA, HAVE YOU GONE HAYWIRE? LET HIM FALL. HE'LL LAND ON THE HIPPOS. QUIET, TIMON. NED, GRAB ONTO MY TUSKS. OH, I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU'RE... YOU'RE SO UNPOPULAR. HURRY, NED! THE BRANCH IS BREAKING! UH... WELL, UH... WHAT DO YOU FELLOWS THINK? GRAB THE TUSK. THE TUSK. HEY! [TIRES SCREECHING] [ENGINE RACING] WELL, I, AHEM... UM, HOW UTTERLY CLUMSY OF ME. I SAY, GOOD SHOW, WARTHOG. OH, YOU'RE WELCOME. IN FACT, NOW THAT YOU'VE PROVEN YOURSELF WORTHY, YOU CAN JOIN OUR GROUP AS AN HONORARY ELEPHANT. WHAT DO YOU SAY? [CLOCK TICKING] -[DING] -NO, THANKS. -NO? -GOOD THINKING, PUMBAA. HOLD OUT FOR BETTER BENEFITS. MAKE THEM MAKE YOU KING, AND ME VICE-KING, WITH A WINDOW OFFICE. NOPE. I'M HAPPY BEING EXACTLY WHO I AM... A NORMAL OLD WARTHOG. OH... OH, WAIT! PUMBAA, WAIT! LET'S THINK THIS OVER. WHAT ABOUT ME? WHAT ABOUT ALL OUR HARD WORK? COME ON! PUMBAA! [SLURP] AHH! YOU ARE TRULY AMAZING, TIMON. I COULDN'T FIND ANY GRUBS ON THIS MOUNTAIN ANYWHERE, NOWHERE, AND YET YOU FOUND A WHOLE BUCKETFUL OF THEM. MMM! MMM! AHH! YES. I AM TRULY AMAZING. YOU ARE UNMISTAKABLY THE MOST AWESOME AND BESTEST BEST GRUB CATCHER IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT. OH, I'VE GOT MY WAYS. SO! YOU STOLE MY BABY'S BREAKFAST, YOU BREAKFAST-STEALING WEASEL! HEY, LADY, RELAX. I WAS GIVING MY BABY EARL HIS FLYING LESSONS. THE POOR KID STILL DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FLY. BUT ANYWAY! WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE NEST, ALL OF HIS GRUBS WERE GONE! BUT, MA'AM, TIMON WOULD NEVER, EVER, NEVER TAKE GRUBS FROM A BABY. AND WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE? BECAUSE HE'S THE BESTEST BEST GRUB CATCHER IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. -RIGHT, TIMON? -THAT'S RIGHT. AND FRANKLY, I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR SLANDEROUS REMARKS AND UNFOUNDED ACCUSATIONS. I MEAN, YOU JUST CAN'T GO AROUND ACCUSING PEOPLE OF STEALING FOOD FROM A BABY. YOU NEED PROOF. I HAVE HAIR SAMPLES, A PLASTER FOOT IMPRESSION, FINGERPRINTS FROM BABY EARL'S BOWL, AND A LIST OF WITNESSES WILLING TO TESTIFY. THIS STUFF DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. PLUS YOU DROPPED YOUR WALLET. YEAH? SO? AND I HAVE THIS TIME-CODED PHOTO OF YOU TAKEN BY A SECURITY CAMERA. YEE... CRUD. TIMON! I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STOLE THOSE GRUBS FROM A BABY. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO GATHER FOOD WAY UP HERE? EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. ABSOLUTELY ASHAMED. IT'LL TAKE ME ALL DAY TO FLY TO THE LOWLANDS AND GATHER MORE FOOD. ALL DAY LONG. AND WHO'S GONNA BABYSIT BABY EARL WHILE I'M AWAY? YEAH, WHO'S GONNA BABYSIT EARL? OHH, DOUBLE CRUD. SWEET LITTLE EARL HERE STILL HASN'T LEARNED HOW TO FLY. SO DON'T LET HIM LEAP OVER THE EDGE OF THE NEST! YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. NO LEAPING. AND IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HIM... ONE...SINGLE... SCRATCH... I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN LIKE THE GRUB-STEALING WEASEL YOU ARE AND CRUSH YOU! NOW, DARLING, MOMMY WILL BE BACK AS QUICK AS SHE CAN. YOU BE A REAL GOOD BOY FOR THE GRUB THIEF. NOW WATCH HIM! [TIMON] GOODBYE! DON'T WORRY, MAMA. BABY EARL WILL BE FINE. BYE-BYE. SO LONG. AUF WIEDERSEHEN. FAREWELL. COME ON. LET'S GO. WHAT! LET'S SKIDDELEY-DADDLE BEFORE MOMMY GETS BACK. BUT, TIMON, YOU PROMISED TO BABYSIT BABY EARL, AND THAT MEANS YOU NEED TO PLAY A GAME WITH HIM, READ A BOOK TO HIM, AND TUCK HIM INTO BED FOR HIS AFTERNOON NAP. YEAH, O.K. IF I DO ALL THOSE THINGS, THEN CAN WE LEAVE WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE? UH...I GUESS SO. GREAT. WAIT RIGHT HERE. ALL RIGHT, BABY EARL, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT. YOU LOSE. "ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WERE THREE BEARS, "A PAPA BEAR, A MAMA BEAR, "AND A WEE LITTLE BABY BEAR. THE END." ♪ ROCKABYE, EARLIE, IN THE TREETOP ♪ ♪ WHEN THE WIND BLOWS, ET CETERA AND SO ON ♪ O.K., LET'S HIT THE ROAD. COME ON, LET'S GO. WHAT ARE YOU WAITIN' FOR, AN INVITATION? I DON'T THINK THAT WAS A VERY GOOD JOB OF BABYSITTING, TIMON. I DID EVERYTHING YOU SAID, PUMBAA. BESIDES, BABY EARL WILL BE JUST FINE. HE'S FAST ASLEEP. SEE? -BABY EARL! -BABY EARL! DON'T YOU NEVER, EVER DO THAT AGAIN, BABY EARL. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? AAH! BABY EARL! I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO NEVER, EVER DO THAT AGAIN. DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME? BABY EARL! YII! TIMON! [TIMON] WHEW! IF THE BABY FALLS OUT OF THE NEST, HE'LL GET SCRATCHED, AND IF HE GETS SCRATCHED, YOU'RE GOING TO GET CRUSHED. I KNOW, I KNOW. SO, I THINK MAYBE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY AND WATCH HIM AND BABYSIT HIM, JUST LIKE WE PROMISED. NO, WE'RE NOT, PUMBAA. I'VE GOT A LITTLE TRICK UP MY SLEEVE. "REVERSE PSY-CHOLOGY." WHAT'S THAT? IT JUST HAPPENS TO BE A WAY OF GETTING SOMEONE TO DO WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO BY ASKING THEM TO DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO. GOOD LUCK. OH, BABY EARL. [CHEEP CHEEP] I REALLY, REALLY WANT YOU TO LEAP OUT OF THE NEST. [CHEEP] SEE? IT WORKED. -BABY EARL! -BABY EARL! WE'D BETTER SAVE HIM BEFORE HE GETS A SCRATCH. AND I GET CRUSHED. OOH! THERE HE IS. BABY EARL'S HEADING TOWARD THAT GAP. WHAT DO WE DO? QUICK, MAKE LIKE A BRIDGE. YI... YI... YI... -AAH! -AAH! THERE HE IS! [PUMBAA] BABY EARL, STOP! WHEW! [GULP] BABY EAR-L-L-L-L! [THUMP THUMP THUMP] [CRASH] OHH! -AAH! -AAH! -AAH! -AAH! [CHEEP] WELL, AT LEAST THERE'S NOT A SCRATCH ON HIM. [SNORT] -BABY EARL! -BABY EARL! TIMON, WHAT DO WE DO THIS TIME? WE'RE NOT DOING NOTHING. BUT, TIMON! TIMON! DON'T YOU FRET, PUMBAA. HE'S A BIRD, RIGHT? ANY SECOND, HIS NATURAL BIRDLIKE INSTINCTS WILL KICK INTO ACTION, AND BABY EARL WILL FLY. YES, ANY SECOND NOW, THE BREEZE WILL CATCH BABY EARL'S WINGS, AND HE WILL SOAR INTO THE CLOUDS. YES, ANY SECOND NOW, THE FLYING AND THE SOARING. ANY...SECOND... [WHISTLING SOUND OF EARL FALLING] WAS HE SUPPOSED TO FLY STRAIGHT INTO THE GROUND, TIMON? NO, PUMBAA, HE WASN'T. SO WHAT WILL YOU TELL MOMMY? PUMBAA, BY THE TIME THAT LOUDMOUTHED BIRD IS BACK, WE'LL HAVE FLOWN THE COOP. WHERE'S MY BABY EARL? UH...OOH... OH, YOU, UH... I SAID, WHERE'S MY BABY EARL! UH...TELL HER, PUMBAA. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO TELL HER? ANYTHING. TELL HER ANYTHING. UH...YOUR BABY EARL LEAPT OUT OF THE NEST, FELL THOUSANDS OF FEET, AND HIT THE GROUND WITH A MUFFLED THUMP SOUND. WHAT! ANYTHING BUT THAT, PUMBAA. I WARNED YOU WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF MY BABY EARL GOT SCRATCHED! BABY EARL, YOU'RE FLYING! -HUH? -HUH? YOU TWO TAUGHT MY BABY EARL HOW TO FLY. THIS IS THE MOST WONDERFUL DAY OF MY FINE-FEATHERED LIFE. HOW CAN I EVER REPAY YOU? UH, WELL, ACTUALLY... THAT ONE'S FOR YOU... AND ONE FOR YOU... AND ONE FOR YOU. [SNORT] MMM! MMM! AIN'T THIS THE LIFE, PUMBAA? MMM! MMM!
