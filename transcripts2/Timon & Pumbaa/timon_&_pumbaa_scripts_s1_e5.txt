I KNOW YOU'RE MY BESTEST BEST FRIEND IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. AND YOU'D NEVER... SHUT UP! (sobbing) BUT I DID, PUMBAA! I DID STEAL YOUR GOLD! I WAS BLINDED BY JEALOUSLY AND I WANTED TO BE MR.

CUSCO SAYS, SO LONG SUCKERS! DON'T FEEL TOO BAD! (laughing) IT'S ALL MY FAULT, PUMBAA. ME AND MY BIG FAT GREEDY HEAD! I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE SENT ADRIFT ON A VAST SHEET OF COLD WHITE STUFF. WHO WOULD EXPECT THAT? NOT MANY I SUPPOSE. MAYBE A COUPLE... BUT NOT MANY, BUT I DIGRESS. OH, TIMON! I... I KNOW A RUSTED OLD CARIBOU COLA BOTTLE CAP ISN'T MUCH, PUMBAA, BUT... IT'S ALL I HAVE. TAKE IT! PLEASE! -IT'S YOURS! -YOU REALLY GOT A HEART OF GOLD! COME HERE, YOU KNUCKLEHEAD MEERKAT. OH, PUMBAA, DON'T EVER NEVER EVER LET THE LURE OF MATERIAL WEALTH COME BETWEEN US! NEVER EVER EVER AGAIN. PARDON ME, BUT DID YOU SAY THAT'S A CARIBOU COLA BOTTLE CAP? -UH, YEAH. -SURE IS. HOORAH! HOORAH! 17 YEARS, I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR A CARIBOU COLA BOTTLE CAP. I ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE IT FOR MY COLLECTION! AND MONEY IS NO OBJECT! NOW, WHO DO I MAKE THE CHECK OUT TO? -ME! ME! NO! -ME! NO, ME! -(arguing) -IT'S MINE! I FOUND THE BOTTLE CAP. (indistinct) -TIMON, WHAT A GREAT GUY. -I'M SUCH A GREAT GUY. SUCH A GREAT GUY. (snoring) -TIMON, WHAT A GREAT GUY. WHAT A GREAT GUY. -I'M SUCH A GREAT GUY. -OH, WHAT A GREAT GUY. -I'M SUCH A GREAT GUY. TIMON, WHAT A GREAT GUY. WHAT A GREAT GUY. -I'M SUCH A GREAT GUY. SUCH A GREAT GUY. -OH, WHAT A GREAT GUY. (snarling) (sneezes) -GESUNDHEIT. -THANK YOU. TIGER! (sneezes) FAST! MAKE WITH THE SPEEDINESS. UH, TIMON, WE'RE RUNNING AWAY, BUT WE'RE NOT BEING CHASED. WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT? MAKES IT MUCH LESS LIKELY WE'LL BE CAUGHT. UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP. STOPPING IS THE LAST THING WE SHOULD DO! GOING IS A MUCH BETTER FORM OF RUNNING AWAY THAN STOPPING. PUMBAA, WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T STOP! (mumbles) (sneezes) MY GOODNESS! THAT'S QUITE A COLD YOU'VE GOT THERE. HERE, HAVE A TISSUE. TISSUE? I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU! (laughs) GET IT? (laughing) I GET IT. I GET IT. PUMBAA, PRECISELY WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING EXACTLY? ADMINISTERING MEDICAL AID. IT'S IMPORTANT TO HELP OTHERS WHO ARE IN NEED. (mimics buzzer) WRONG! PUMBAA, SHE'S A TIGRESS! A GIRL TIGER, i.e., A PREDATOR. SAY IT WITH ME, PRE-DA-TOR. -SO? -LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT A LITTLE THING WE CALL THE FOOD CHAIN. SEE, IN THE NATURAL WORLD, THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANIMALS WHEREBY THE BIGGER ONES EAT THE SMALLER ONES. EXHIBIT A, A FISH, SEEMINGLY HAPPY AS IT SWIMS ABOUT ON ITS DAILY ROUTINE. UNTIL PRESTO, A BIGGER FISH COMES ALONG AND EATS IT! THIS FISH IN TURN, IS THEN EATEN BY AN EVEN BIGGER FISH! AM I MAKING MYSELF CLEAR HERE? PSST, TIMON, SHE'S NOT A FISH. WHY? LOOK, SHE IS A CARNIVORE, A PREDATOR. HELPING HER IS COUNTER REPRODUCTIVE. SHE HUNTS AND CATCHES GUYS LIKE US! ACTUALLY, THE ONLY THING I'VE EVER CAUGHT IS THIS COLD. (laughs) YOU MEAN YOU'VE NEVER EVER CAUGHT ANYTHING EVER, IN YOUR WHOLE LIFE? NEVER? NOT EVEN ONCE? DEAR RALPH, MY HUSBAND, WAS THE HUNTER. HE WAS THE ONE WHO USED TO BRING HOME THE BACON! (laughing) BUT NOW WITH HIM GONE, IT'S UP TO ME TO FEED THE FAMILY. WOW! YOU'VE BEEN BUSY! I SUPPOSE I AM GOOD AT ONE THING. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO HUNTING, STALKING AND POUNCING, I'M A THREE-PEATING TRIPLE CROWN WASHOUT. OH TIMON, WE CAN'T LET THE LITTLE TIGERS GO HUNGRY. WE JUST GOT TO HELP HER! WE JUST GOTTA! WE GOTTA! WE GOTTA! WE GOTTA! WE GOTTA! WE GOTTA! WE? OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. NOT "WE", PUMBAA. I'M NOT HELPING ANYBODY, ANYWAY, ANYHOW. NO, THANK YOU, CHECK PLEASE, I'M OUTTA HERE! JUST TO SATISFY MY CURIOSITY, WHY DID YOU THINK I WOULD TEACH THIS TIGRESS HOW TO HUNT? BECAUSE YOU OWE ME ONE! I OWE YOU ONE? -SINCE WHEN? -SINCE YESTERDAY! (laughing) PUMBAA, YOU JUST SAVED MY LIFE! THANK YOU, I OWE YOU ONE! AW, SHUCKS, TIMON. IT WAS NOTHING. OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! I OWE YOU ONE, PAL. AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT! NO ARGUMENTS! OKAY, IF YOU INSIST. YOU OWE ME ONE. OKAY, I'LL HELP. (grunting) FIRST RULE OF HUNTING IS YOU'VE GOT TO FIND WHERE YOU CAN EAT THE FOOD, AND THIS IS WHERE YOU FIND THE FOOD. I'M GOING TO HELP YOU NOW. SEE ANYTHING? YEAH, THE UNDERSIDE OF A TWO TON BOULDER! (laughs) YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME! SHE'S A TIGER! SHE DOESN'T EAT UNDER THE ROCK BUGS LIKE WE DO, SHE EATS THOSE BIG, MEATY, NON-MEERKAT TYPE THINGS WHICH FROLIC ACROSS THE GRASSLANDS. -YOU DO? -WELL, YEAH. IT'S A TIGER THANG! (laughs) THEN WHY ARE WE LOOKING UNDER THIS BIG ROCK? THANKS, TIMON! GLAD I COULD HELP. ONCE YOU'VE LOCATED YOUR PREY, OR FOOD AS WE CALL IT, YOU'VE GOT TO SNEAK UP ON HIM! WATCH ME! (burping) I HEAR SOMEONE SNEAKING! I HATE THAT! GO AWAY! GO AWAY! GO AWAY! (groaning) TO AVOID ANY MORE UNPLEASANT ENCOUNTERS, WHEREIN SOLID OBJECTS IMPACT WITH MY SKULL, I HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE OVER THE LESSONS! SORRY, TIMON. NOW, LISTEN TO ME. ALL YOU REALLY NEED FOR HUNTING IS A GOOD POUNCE. AND FOR A GOOD POUNCE, YOU NEED ALTITUDE, WHICH IS WHY I'VE PUT TOGETHER THIS! I CALL IT, TIMON THE HANDSOME AND SMART MEERKAT'S INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS PULTZY THING. Both: LOOKS LIKE A SEE-SAW. NEW RULE, FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS LESSON, I AM THE ONLY ONE ALLOWED TO SPEAK. FIRST PUMBAA, YOU'LL BE IN THE IGNITION POSITION HERE. THEN WE PUT THE LAUNCHEE ONTO THE PRE-POUNCE LOCATION HERE. AND LAST, WE PLACE THE DESIRED MEATY THING HERE. WHEN THAT LANDS THERE, YOU WILL POUNCE. HEY! OKAY PUMBAA, BLAST OFF! CAREFUL! GET READY, GET READY! POUNCE! (gasps) THAT'S IT! THAT DOES IT, I QUIT! KAPUT! FINIT . NO MORE HELPING FROM ME. LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU, PUMBAA. YOU ONLY HELP SOMEONE IF YOU GET SOMETHING IN RETURN. IDEALLY, WHAT YOU GET IN RETURN SHOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN THE EFFORT YOU EXPENDED IN HELPING! BUT THERE IS NO BETTER THING TO BE GOTTEN FROM HELPING THIS... THIS... THIS... THREE-PEATING, TRIPLE CROWN WASHOUT. THREE-PEATING, TRIPLE CROWN WASHOUT. EXACTLY! I MEAN, WHY DON'T WE FIND A LION CUB WE CAN RAISE? NOW THAT'S AN IDEA! HE COULD BE ON OUR SIDE. BUT WHO WANTS HER ON OUR SIDE? -SHE'S USELESS! -I KNOW WHEN I'M NOT WANTED. GUESS I WON'T BE MAKING HIS CHRISTMAS CARD LIST! (laughs) SORRY WE COULDN'T BE MUCH HELP. OH, YOU HELPED LOTS, KIDDO. DON'T FRET. I'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT. -GOODBYE! -BYE! GOOD RIDDANCE. COME ON, PUMBAA. LET'S AMSCRAY. (screaming) SAY PUMBAA, WHY DON'T WE GO BACK AND TEACH THIS GUY HOW TO HUNT? (laughs) TIMON, HELP! I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING! I NEED HELP! I NEED... HOW IRONIC. -WHAT DO YOU WANT? -NOTHING... HELP! -NOTHING? -WELL, THAT'S NOTHING. I MEAN, IT'S A JACKAL AND IT'S GOING TO EAT MY BESTEST BEST FRIEND, BUT... ARE YOU ASKING ME FOR HELP? YES! YES! YES! YES! NO! WELL, MAYBE I AM. SORT OF. YOU ONLY HELP SOMEONE IF YOU GET SOMETHING IN RETURN. IDEALLY WHAT YOU GET IN RETURN SHOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN THE EFFORT YOU EXPENDED IN HELPING. BESIDES, I'M USELESS, REMEMBER? WELL, THAT'S JUST FINE, I MEAN... WHAT IF EVERYBODY HAD YOUR ATTITUDE, HM? THEN THE WHOLE WORLD WOULD BE FILLED WITH NOTHING BUT A BUNCH OF NON-HELPING HELPLESS UNHELPERS. TIMON! I'M SORRY! BELIEVE ME IF I HAD ANY IDEA I'D HAVE TO EAT MY OWN WORDS, I NEVER WOULD HAVE SAID SO MANY. HONEST. IF YOU'RE ASKING ME FOR HELP, ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS ASK. (exclaiming) -HELP. -THERE, NOW THAT WASN'T SO BAD, WAS IT? LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO. (sneezes) (screeching) (sneezes) (sneezes) KEEP AWAY! KEEP AWAY! (yelping) LOOKS LIKE MY BAD COLD GOT ME A HOT MEAL! (laughs) YOU SEE, TIMON, WE DID GET SOMETHING IN RETURN FOR HELPING HER. MORE THAN YOU KNOW, PUMBAA. MORE THAN YOU KNOW. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN? -I GOT HER COLD! (sneezes)
