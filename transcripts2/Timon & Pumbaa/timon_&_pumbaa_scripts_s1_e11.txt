 (gasping) -PUMBAA! -WAIT! WHAT? WAIT! WHO? OH! YOUR CRIMINAL PAST HAS CAUGHT UP WITH YOU! YOU GOTTA RUN OR THEY'LL HANG YOUR HIDE. PUMBAA, NEXT TIME TRY RUNNING AWAY! DO YOU MIND? MY NAME IS MR. BUTTONS. I HAVE NO INTENTIONS OF HANGING ANYONE'S HIDE. AND QUITE FRANKLY, I RESENT THE ACCUSATION. OH, YEAH? WELL, BUTTONS, RIDDLE ME THIS. WHAT WERE YOU DOING SIZING THIS HERE HOG NECK FOR A NOOSE? WELL, I WAS TAKING MEASUREMENTS FOR HIS TUXEDO AND BOW-TIE. MR. PUMBAA IS NOT GETTING EXECUTED, HE'S GETTING MARRIED. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE? UH, NO OFFENSE, BUT I DON'T WANNA MARRY YOU. OH, NOT ME! I AM ONLY HERE TO MAKE CERTAIN THIS WEDDING IS CARRIED OUT IN STRICT ACCORDANCE WITH THE REVERED WARTHOG TRADITIONS AND BYLAWS AS STIPULATED IN THIS BOOK. OH, SO YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED? AND WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING TO TELL ME? BUT I DIDN'T KNOW I WAS GETTING MARRIED. IT IS A PRE-ARRANGED MARRIAGE, DECIDED AND SET IN STONE YEARS BEFORE MR. PUMBAA WAS EVEN BORN. AND NOW, IT IS MY DUTY AND DISTINCT PLEASURE TO PRESENT MR. PUMBAA'S BRIDE TO BE... (mimicking fanfare) COME OUT NOW, MISS ROSEBUD. IT'S ALL RIGHT. ROSEBUD, THIS IS MR. PUMBAA, THE WARTHOG YOU'RE GOING TO MARRY. AND THAT'S MR. PUMBAA'S FRIEND. IT'S A... (clears throat) PLEASURE TO MEET... ALL RIGHT NOW, YOU CAN GET TO KNOW MR. PUMBAA LATER. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY AND YOU NEED TO REST. THE CEREMONY IS AT 12:00 NOON, TOMORROW. DON'T YOU DARE BE ONE SECOND LATE! WE'LL BE THERE! OH, YEAH, BYE-BYE. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. WE CAN BE MILES AWAY BY NOON TOMORROW. GEE, TIMON, I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD DEFY WARTHOG TRADITIONS. THEY'RE IMPORTANT FOR THE CULTURAL IDENTITY THAT CONNECTS ONE GENERATION OF WARTHOGS TO THE NEXT. OH, STOP IT, PUMBAA! YOU'RE CREEPING ME OUT. WELL, GETTING MARRIED IS A TRADITION. PUMBAA, FORGET THE LOUSY TRADITION. IF YOU GET MARRIED, YOU WILL NEVER HUNT BUGS, SING SONGS OR GO ON WACKY, HIGH JINKS-FILLED ADVENTURES WITH YOUR LOYAL AND DEVOTED PAL, TIMON, EVER AGAIN! GEE, I WOULDN'T LIKE THAT. DON'T WORRY, PUMBAA. I'LL FIND YOU A WAY OUT OF THIS WEDDING. FOR YOU BENEFIT, AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL FREEDOM-LOVING, ARMPIT-SCRATCHING, BUG-EATING BROTHERS EVERYWHERE! HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT, TIMON? THERE'S ALWAYS A LOOPHOLE, PUMBAA. THE CHALLENGE IS KNOWING WHERE TO FIND IT. MAYBE IT'S IN MR. BUTTON'S BIG BOOK OF WARTHOG TRADITIONS AND BYLAWS. SAVE YOUR STRENGTH, PUMBAA AND LEAVE THE CHALLENGES TO ME. I MEAN, IT TAKES A SUPERIOR INTELLECT LIKE MYSELF TO KNOW THERE'S ONLY ONE PLACE WE'LL FIND THE AFOREMENTIONED LOOPHOLE. THERE, IN MR. BUTTON'S BIG BOOK OF WARTHOG TRADITIONS AND BYLAWS. I'LL ASK IF WE CAN BORROW IT. PUMBAA, WHEN YOU GO LOOKING FOR A LOOPHOLE, YOU HAVE TO BE DECEITFUL AND UNDERHANDED, OR ELSE IT DOESN'T COUNT. (snoring) HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET THAT BOOK WITHOUT WAKING UP MR. BUTTONS? WE'LL HAVE TO REPLACE IT WITH A SIMILAR TYPE OBJECT, OF EQUAL OR SAME SIZE. I KNOW! WE'LL USE YOUR COPY OF THE WARTHOG TRADITIONS AND BYLAWS. "HOLIDAY HOG TRADITIONS, SUMMER SWINE SOCIALS... "JUNGLE TEA PARTIES, HOOF CLAPPING." HERE WE GO! "WARTHOG WEDDINGS!" "TRADITION ALLOWS THE GROOM ABSOLUTELY NO SAY IN WHO HE MARRIES, WHEN HE MARRIES "OR WHETHER HE EVEN WANTS TO MARRY." "IT IS THE BRIDE'S SPECIAL DAY AND THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN GET OUT OF IT, BUDDY." WHOA! PUMBAA, I FOUND IT! I FOUND THE LOOPHOLE! "IF THE BRIDE DECIDES, WITH JUSTIFIABLE CAUSE "THAT SHE CANNOT LOVE HER DESIGNATED HUSBAND "DUE TO ILL-MANNERED BEHAVIOR, "UNACCEPTABLE PERSONAL APPEARANCE, OR FOUL BODY ODOR, "SHE CAN CALL THE WEDDING OFF!" WELL, THAT SETTLES IT. IT DOES? OKAY, PUMBAA, YOUR MOTIVATION IS A COMPULSIVE DESIRE TO BE ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING. I WANT RUDE, I WANT CRUDE, I WANT BAD MANNERS...GO! (burping) NO, NO, NO, SORRY, PUMBAA. I'M NOT FEELING THE WRETCHEDNESS, THE SQUALOR. FROM THE TOP AGAIN, PLEASE! OH, BUT TIMON, THOSE ARE THE WORST MANNERS I'VE GOT! THEY'RE AWFUL! AWFUL IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. WE'RE GOING FOR ATROCIOUS! TIMON, CAN I COME OUT NOW? ALL RIGHT, COME ON OUT! (sniffing) KEEP SOAKING. BUT TIMON, I'VE BEEN SOAKING IN THIS SMELLY MUDHOLE EATING STINKBUG BURRITOS FOR AN HOUR! I SMELL TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE WON'T CUT IT, PUMBAA. WE'RE GOING FOR HORRENDOUS! BUT IT'S ALMOST NOON AND MR. BUTTONS WARNED US NOT TO BE ONE SECOND LATE! (grunting) YOU ARE TWO HOURS LATE! GO ON. YEAH! WELL, THAT'S THE KIND OF PIG I AM! HE DON'T PLAY BY THE RULES. I'M MY OWN HOG AND NOTHING'S GOING TO CRAMP MY STYLE. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT, SISTER? WHAT IS THAT SMELL? WHY, THAT'D BE ME! WELL, NOW THEN, SHALL WE BEGIN? "DEARLY BELOVED, WE ARE GATHERED HERE TO WITNESS "THE SACRED UNION OF THESE TWO WARTHOGS IN WEDDED MATRIMONY... "IF ANYONE HAS REASON TO BELIEVE THEY SHOULD NOT BE MARRIED, "SPEAK NOW OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR... " (burping) EXCUSE ME. NO! THERE IS NO EXCUSE! THE WARTHOG WEDDING IS A TIME-HONORED TRADITION AND YOU'VE MADE A MOCKERY OF IT. YOUR MANNERS ARE ATROCIOUS -AND... -AND HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE? REPULSIVE! ATTABOY, PUMBAA! THIS IS AN OUTRAGE! WHAT CAN YOU DO? THIS PREARRANGED WEDDING IS PART OF A RESPECTED WARTHOG TRADITION. I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S SOME BIG LOOPHOLE ON PAGE 346 OF THAT BIG BOOK OF YOURS. OH, BUT THERE IS! THERE IS? THE WEDDING CAN BE CALLED OFF ENTIRELY IF THE BRIDE DOESN'T LOVE THE GROOM. AND HOW ON EARTH COULD ROSEBUD LOVE THAT SLOPPY, SMELLY, ILL-MANNERED PIG? Rosebud: WITH ALL MY HEART. -WHO SAID THAT? -I DID! I AM THE BRIDE. SHOULDN'T I DECIDE IF I'M IN LOVE WITH MR. PUMBAA OR NOT? WELL, TECHNICALLY. BUT THERE MUST BE A WAY AROUND THAT! OH, WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS A LOOPHOLE... BUT I'M CRAZY IN LOVE WITH PUMBAA. All: YOU ARE? PUMBAA DOES EVERYTHING I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO. DRESS WEIRD, TALK BACK, SMELL BAD, AND LIVE WILD! BUT THAT'S NOT ME! EXCEPT FOR THE SMELLING BAD PART. I'M NOTHING BUT A FRAUD! HE PUT THE PHONY IN BALONEY! I'M NOT A WILD BIKER HOG! I'M KIND, SINCERE AND DOWN TO EARTH! HE'S SENSITIVE AND CARING, AND NOT AFRAID TO CRY. I LIKE SMELLING THE FLOWERS, CATCHING RAIN DROPS ON MY TONGUE. OH, WEDDING'S OFF. IT IS? I NEED ME A HOG WHO LIVES ON THE EDGE. THE WILDER, THE BETTER! OH, SO NOW HE'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YA, HUH? WELL, YOU'LL NEVER FIND A HUSBAND THAT'S HALF THE HOG THAT PUMBAA IS! LOOK NO FURTHER, ROSEBUD! I'M YOUR MAN! RUGGED AND UNTAMED! (burps) I BEG YOUR PARDON. I'M AN ANIMAL! I STINK! I LOVE... RUN, PUMBAA! WE MAY BE COWARDS, BUT WE'RE FAST COWARDS. RETENTION, RETREAT, THESE ACTIONS ARE FUTILE AGAINST I, CONGO QUINT, THE BRAVEST, STRONGEST, MOST ADVENTUROUS ADVENTURER WEST OF THE GREAT RIFT VALLEY. (scatting) PPST, TIMON, I THINK I'M WEARING DIAPERS. SHUSH. BUT I HAVEN'T WORN DIAPERS SINCE I WAS A WEE, LITTLE, TINY BABY. WILL YOU SHUSH? HEY, AND I'M WEARING A DRESS, TOO! -SHUSH! -BUT I LOOK LIKE A LITTLE GIRL! PUMBAA, BE QUIET! YOU WANT TO GET US CAUGHT? HI, THERE. ATTAINMENT, TROPHY, WORTHY ACHIEVEMENT! (groaning) PUMBAA, THERE'S A GORILLA IN OUR MIDST. OH! OH! WHAT PRECIOUS LITTLE BABYKINS! I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED MY OWN LITTLE SUGAR PLUM DUMPLINGS AND NOW I'VE GOT YOU, I COULD DIE! BIG HUG! BIG HUG! LOVING YOU! OH, YOU BUTTER CUP, SWEETIE PIES! LOOK AT YOU. LOOK AT YOU! OH! YOU MUST BE SO TIRED AND HUNGRY AND COLD. FORGET ABOUT IT. YOU JUST LIE DOWN. I'LL FORAGE SOME BANANAS THAT'LL PUT HAIR ON YOUR LITTLE CHESTS AND YOUR ARMS AND YOUR LEGS, AND YOUR LITTLE TOOTSIES, LOOK AT YOU! I CAN'T STAND IT! AH! YOU'LL BE JUST LIKE MOMMY! UH, TIMON... QUIET PUMBAA! I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THIS GORILLA IS TREATING US LIKE BABIES? HEY... PUMBAA! THE REASON THIS GORILLA IS TREATING US LIKE BABIES IS BECAUSE SHE THINKS WE'RE BABIES! NO! YES! AND THIS GIVES ME A GREAT IDEA. DON'T YOU SEE? DON'T YOU GET IT? DON'T YOU REALIZE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE? YEAH! WE'VE GOT ME IN A DRESS! PUMBAA, PUMBAA, PUMBAA! WE HAVE GOT OURSELVES AN 800 POUND GORILLA BODYGUARD, WHO IS GOING TO KEEP US, HER LITTLE BUTTER CUP SWEETIE PIES, SAFE FROM TRIGGER HAPPY BUNGALOW BILL OUT THERE! TIMON! AH, DON'T GIVE ME THE SHOCKED WARTHOG LOOK. THIS IS PERFECT! WE MAKE LIKE BABY APES AND WE'RE SAFE AS HOUSES! IT'LL BE A PIECE OF, YOU KNOW, LAYERS... WITH FROSTING... -CAKE? -NO THANKS, I ALREADY ATE. (laughing) I ALREADY ATE! THIS IS A TOUGH ROOM. JUST RELAX. THIS IS FOOL PROOF. WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG? (yelps) CLUTCH THE PURSE, MY GRACIOUS, FOR ME? CORRECTIMO. I, AN ABSOLUTELY NORMAL APE, HAVE ADORED YOU FROM AFAR FOR COUNTLESS YEARS AND NOW I HAVE COME TO ASK FOR YOUR HAND, IN MARRIAGE! OH, MY! THIS IS ALL SO SUDDEN, I COULDN'T POSSIBLY... LET ME FIX MY FACE, WE'LL LEAVE IMMEDIATELY! OH, WOULD YOU KEEP AN EYE ON MY LITTLE BAMBINO INFANT-TOTS FOR A TEENIE-TINY MOMENT? UH-OH! A RIVAL FOR MOM'S AFFECTIONS. MAKE LIKE A BABY. (babbling) (laughs) AT LAST! CONGO QUINT HAS YOU! MR. LUCKY, TA-DA! OH! OH! OH! I CAN'T STAND IT! THIS IS SO SWEET! LOOK AT THEIR LITTLE PUNUMS. THEY LIKE YOU, TOO. AND I LIKE THEM. BRAINSTORM! HOW ABOUT I TAKE THE BABIES FOR A LONG WALK? JUST ME AND THEM, WE'LL GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER BETTER. BIG APE TO LITTLE APE AND APE-ETTE. (exclaiming in shock) (roaring) SO, THAT BIG MISTER MAN THINKS HE CAN MESS WITH MY LITTLE BUTTONS, SWEETUMS, DOES HIMS? (scoffing) WELL, I WON'T LET ANYTHING GET MY LITTLE BABY SPOTS. NO, NO, NO. YOU'LL BE SAFE AND SOUND RIGHT HERE, WHERE I CAN PROTECT YOU. SEE, WHAT'D I TELL 'YA? I DON'T KNOW, TIMON. I FEEL LIKE THE BIGGEST LIAR IN THE WHOLE WORLD. IT'S NOT NICE TO LIE. NICE? OH, EXCUSE ME, PUMBAA OF SUNNYBROOK FARM. YOU THINK THAT HUNTER IS CONCERNED WITH "NICE"? THE ONLY "NICE" THING HE'S THINKING IS HOW "NICE" WE'LL TASTE WITH A SIDE OF COLESLAW AND A ROOT BEER. BESIDES, NICE GUYS FINISH LAST. (humming) OOH, AND THERE'S BIG SMILE. OH, OH, PERFECT! -(doorbell rings) -AND JUST IN TIME! I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR MY PRECIOUS LITTLE BABIES WHO LOVE ME! AND MAMA LOVES THEM, TOO, YES I DO! -OH! -TIMON... I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS. PUMBAA, OBVIOUSLY THIS IS SOME TYPE OF SPECIAL OCCASION. OH, LOOK AT THOSE LITTLE ANGELS! THEY'RE SO CUTE!

JUST A FEW PRIVATE WORDS WITH MY SIBLING HERE. PUMBAA, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? I CAN'T GO THROUGH WITH IT, TIMON. WE'RE NOT HER BABIES! WHAT WE'RE DOING IS DISHONEST AND IT'S GOING TO GET US KILLED! I'VE GOT TO TELL HER THE TRUTH. PUMBAA, OLD BUDDY, NO! THE TRUTH IS A DANGEROUS, DEADLY THING. BELIEVE ME, SOMETIMES IT'S BETTER TO TELL A LIE. IN FACT, MOST TIMES IT'S BETTER TO LIE. WELL, THAT'S FOR ME TO DECIDE! AND I'VE DECIDED TO TELL THE TRUTH. (sighs) FINE, GO TELL. MISSUS GORILLA LADY... UH, I... YOU SEE, THE THING IS, WE'RE NOT BABIES. WE WERE JUST ACTING LIKE BABIES. THAT WAY WE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR MATERNAL INSTINCTS FOR OUR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY AND COMFORT. (roaring) YOU SEE, TIMON, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY. (roaring) (squealing) (yelps) AH-HA! JUBILATION! CONGO QUINT HAS DONE IT! THERE'S NO ONE TO STOP ME THIS TIME. (laughing evilly) HAPPY, PUMBAA? THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR TELLING THE TRUTH. (camera clicks) CONGO QUINT HAS DONE IT!
