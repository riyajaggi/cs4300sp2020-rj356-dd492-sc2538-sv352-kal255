WHAT BACON BITS FOR BRAINS THERE DON'T KNOW WON'T HURT HIM. LIE! WELL, TIMON, HAVE YOU SEEN MY BUG PAL, OR HAVEN'T YOU? NO. (burps) WELL, IT SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH TO SPOT HIM! OR AT LEAST SMELL HIM.

(both screaming) DON'T EVER DO THAT AGAIN! OH, I HAD THE MOST HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE, PUMBAA. ALL THESE BUGS! IT MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING I ATE! OR, UH, RATHER DIDN'T EAT. DIDN'T EAT. AS LONG AS YOU'RE OKAY, THAT'S WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT, RIGHT? UH, PUMBAA, LOOK. THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING I NEED TO TELL YOU. I ALWAYS WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY, TIMON. YOU'RE MY VERY BEST FRIEND! GREAT! IT'S, UM, ABOUT YOUR STINKY LITTLE FRIEND. THE ONE YOU SAY WAS OVER THERE. YEAH, STINKY! WHAT ABOUT HIM? WELL, IT'S LIKE THIS... UH, A FEROCIOUS GRIZZLE BEAR BROKE INTO THE CABIN AND KIDNAPPED HIM. WOW! WE'VE GOT TO GO SAVE HIM! HE COULD STILL BE ALIVE! COME ON, TIMON! AYE! (sighs) PUMBAA, THIS IS LIKE LOOKING FOR A BEETLE IN A HAYSTACK. MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST FORGET IT. FORGET IT? NO TIMON. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP SEARCHING. LONG AND HARD, NIGHT AND DAY, LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED. COME ON! UM, NO GRIZZLE BEAR, NO PROBLEM. PUMBAA, OVER HERE. OVER HERE! WHAT, TIMON? IS THE GRIZZLE BEAR INSIDE THERE? YES, THAT'S RIGHT. JUST INSIDE. NOW YOU WAIT HERE WHILE I GO IN THERE AND RESCUE YOUR BUG FRIEND. WHAT A PAL! ALL RIGHT, YOU... FEROCIOUS GRIZZLE BEAR, YOU. HAND OVER THE BUG, OR YOU'LL HAVE ME TO CONTEND WITH! (mimics growling) ALL RIGHT, YOU ASKED FOR IT! (grunting) HEY, PUMBAA! I'M REALLY SMASHING AND CRASHING THAT BAD OLD GRIZZLE BEAR! WHAT A PAL, WHAT A PAL, WHAT A PAL, WHAT A PAL! GO TIMON! AND THAT! AND THAT! WELL, PUMBAA, I GUESS THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT BAD OLD GRIZZLE... BEAR. (screaming) HEY, TIMON, WHAT ABOUT THE BUG? (roaring) GIVE IT THE GAS, PUMBAA! NO PROBLEM WITH ME! GOOD JOB, PUMBAA! YOUR WIND TOOK THE WIND OUT OF HIS SAILS. -THANKS! -(both screaming) EH, PUMBAA, I THINK WE'RE IN TROUBLE. GET OUT! YOU STINK! WE'LL FIND US ANOTHER DRUMMER. (laughing) WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, TIMON? TASTE GOOD, I SUPPOSE. I'VE GOT TO HELP THEM! BUT HOW CAN I? (sneezing) (screaming) SAY, LOOK WHO IT IS! -WHO IS IT? -THE BUG! WHAT BUG? -MY BUG! -YOUR BUG? BUG PAL! THANKS FOR SAVING US, PAL! OH, WELL, IT'S THE LEAST I COULD DO. BUT, IF THAT'S WHO I THINK IT IS, THEN, WHO DID I... WHAT'S WRONG, TIMON? OH, PUMBAA, I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE. I THOUGHT I HAD EATEN YOUR FRIEND AND WHEN YOU ASKED ME IF I KNEW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM... (sobbing) I LIED! YOU MEAN YOU MADE EVERYTHING UP? EVERYTHING! I'M SORRY! WILL YOU EVER FORGIVE ME? OH, TIMON... APOLOGY ACCEPTED. THANKS PUMBAA. COME ON, LET'S GET BACK TO THE CABIN. SAY, IF YOU TWO LADS ARE REALLY HUNGRY, I DO HAVE A FEW FORMER BEETLE CHUMS I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO. All: HELP! (screaming) RUN, PUMBAA! AH, WE'RE GOING TO DIE, WE'RE GOING TO DIE! (roaring) (whimpers) (flushing) (laughing) HEY, HERE'S A TIP BIG BOY, NEXT TIME YOU GO RIVER RAFTING, BRING YOUR RAFT! (laughs) PHEW! THAT WAS A CLOSE CALL! WHAT? OH, THAT MOOK DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE! HAVEN'T YOU EVER NOTICED, PUMBAA? THAT WHILE WE ARE FREQUENTLY CHASED, WE ARE NEVER EATEN. TRUE, SOMETIMES WE CUT IT CLOSE, BUT WE NEVER ACTUALLY GET CAUGHT! AND WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE CHARMED IN A LUCKY FORTUNATE TYPE WAY! BUT OUR LUCK CAN'T LAST FOREVER, TIMON. WHAT? YOU THINK SOMEHOW THAT BIG OLD CAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT BACK UP THE RIVER, SLYLY STALK US AND POUNCE WITH A GREAT BIG ROAR? (roaring) (screaming) OH, NO! NICE KITTY! (screaming) PUMBAA, IF YOU LIKE MY FACE YOU BETTER PICK UP THE PACE! WHERE DO I GO? OH, WE'RE GOING TO DIE, WE'RE GOING TO DIE! AH, EXCUSE ME A MOMENT, I'M NEEDED UP IN NAVIGATION. COME IN WARTHOG, WE'VE GOT UNFRIENDLY FANGS BEARING 1-5-9ER. PROCEED A.S.A.P. TO THE NEAREST HOLLOW TREE. OVER. WARTHOG TO MEERKAT, WARTHOG TO MEERKAT, AFFIRMATIVE, MEERKAT. I GOT ONE IN MY SIGHT, BUT I AIN'T GONNA FIT. TIMON, THE HOLE IS TOO SMALL! WARTHOG, YOU'RE BREAKING UP, BUT IN CASE YOU CAN STILL READ ME, I THINK THE HOLE IS TOO SMALL! (yelps) (panting) OH, ARE WE STILL IN ONE PIECE? HEAD, BODY, TAIL, SNOUT. SNOUT? SNOUT! AH! MY SNOUT IS GONE, PUMBAA! WAIT A MINUTE! I DON'T HAVE A SNOUT! PHEW! OKAY, WE'RE FINE. BUT WHAT IF HE'S STILL OUT THERE? FRANKLY, I CAN'T SEE MUCH OF ANYTHING OUT HERE. BOY, NIGHT SURE FALLS FAST IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS. I DON'T REMEMBER IT BEING THIS DARK! AH! THEN AGAIN, I DON'T REMEMBER BEING SURROUNDED BY FEROCIOUS TEETH AND HEALTHY GUMS EITHER! SO IF I HAD TO HAZARD A GUESS, I'D SAY... HE'S STILL THERE. WE'RE GOING TO DIE, TIMON! HE'S GOT US UP A TREE. CORRECTION, PUMBAA, OLD PAL! HE'S GOT US IN A TREE! BUT IF WE GO UP THE TREE, WE CAN JUMP ONTO ANY ONE OF ABOUT TEN BAJILLION OTHERS! AND BY THE TIME WE'RE FINISHED TRAVERSING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH, OLD FANG BOY OUT THERE WILL BE JUST A MEMORY! I HOPE IT WORKS, TIMON. CONFIDENCE, PUMBAA. ALL WE GOTTA DO IS MAKE LIKE A TREE AND LEAF! HA! (gasping) (laughing) WELL, PUMBAA, IT APPEARS OUR PLAN HAS BEEN CUT SHORT. OH, NO, HE CHOPPED DOWN ALL THE TREES AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET CHEWED UP LIKE TOOTHPICKS! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO? GEE, I DON'T KNOW PUMBAA, I'M STUMPED! (laughs) OH, MAN! ANYWAY, IT'S SIMPLE. I'LL JUST THINK OF ANOTHER PLAN. WE CAN ASSEMBLE A SUBTERRANEAN ARMORED VEHICLE, CAPABLE OF DRILLING BENEATH THE EARTH'S CRUST, THEREBY TRANSPORTING US AWAY FROM THE PREDATOR. UH-UH. WE'LL LAUNCH A THREE-STAGE ORBITAL SPACE POD, TRAVEL THROUGH THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE, THEN TOUCH DOWN ON A SPOT, PREDETERMINED TO BE SAFE FROM ALL PREDATORS. NAH! -CALL A TREE SURGEON? -NAH! -PRETEND WE'RE INVISIBLE? -NO! GO TO FUNKY TOWN? -MAKE GELATIN. -NAH! -SING SONGS? -NO! -SCREAM! -NOPE! -CRY! -NO! -BELCH. -UH-UH. (burps) WELL, THEN, I HAVE ONE LAST BRILLIANT IDEA! REALLY? WHAT? TELL ME! RUN! (roaring) (screaming) WHAT ARE YOU? A PIG OR A PROTRACTOR? YOU RAN US RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED! UH, BUT TIMON, WE WERE GOING TO DIE! SO WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO DO NOW? WAIT HIM OUT? AH, YOU'RE IN NO STATE TO MAKE DECISIONS, PUMBAA. I SAY WE JUST... WAIT HIM OUT. BUT IF WE'RE STUCK HERE IN THIS TREE, AREN'T WE GOING TO GET HUNGRY? HUNGRY, PUMBAA? OH, WE'RE GOING TO BE STARVING! RAVENOUS AND HALLUCINATING THAT WE WANT TO EAT EACH OTHER! UNLESS, WE KEEP BUSY. (laughing) (thuds) (squeaks) (burps) (burping) I WONDER IF HE'S STILL OUT THERE. SAY, PUMBAA, YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS WONDERING? WHAT'S THAT, TIMON? COULD I HAVE THAT APPLE IN YOUR MOUTH? APPLE? WHAT APPLE? THE ONE THAT I'D LIKE FOR DESSERT! DESSERT? BUT WHAT'S FOR DINNER? YOU! (munching) HOLD IT RIGHT THERE, TIMON. WE'RE PALS, REMEMBER? NOW PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER! (chuckles) WHAT? OH. CAN'T YOU TAKE A LITTLE JOKE? A JOKE? ALONG WITH A LITTLE STEAK? OH, LET ME GUESS, A T-BONE? NO, BUT TIMON! WAIT A MINUTE! PUMBAA, LOOK WHAT'S BECOME OF US! 95 SHORT YEARS! WE'RE NOT ONLY BORED, WE'RE SMORGASBORD. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS? THAT OUR LUCK HAS FINALLY RUN OUT? NO, IT MEANS WE'RE GONNA DIE! BE BRAVE, MY POOR-SEEING PAL, BECAUSE AFTER ALL, WE STARTED AS FRIENDS AND WE'LL END AS FRIENDS. (both sobbing) GOOD SIR, WE ARE PREPARED TO MEET OUR FATE. FOR PROUDLY, WE HAVE LIVED. AND BRAVELY WE WILL DIE. JUST. IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU GUYS CAME OUT OF THERE. WELL, AREN'T YOU GOING TO EAT US? I CAN'T EAT MEAT! WELL, ANYMORE... Both: HUH? IT'S THE DOCTOR'S ORDERS. ALL I CAN EAT IS BRAN MUSH AND PRUNE JUICE. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I STILL CAN'T CHASE YOU! (coughing) (coughing) COME BACK HERE, YOU GUYS! (coughing and choking)
