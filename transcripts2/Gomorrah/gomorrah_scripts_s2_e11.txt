 Isn't anyone in here? Sasà! Things okay? Hurry! We don't see how they got so far. Maybe you shouldn't stay here. They move forward every day. Everyone knows where you are. Dad! Can we finish our game? Coming, wait for me in there. I'm not going anywhere. Don Pietro sends his compliments. Okay, but we want a spot.

 One thing at a time. First we get rid of Raffaele, but quietly. Cops are everywhere. Or we won't sell shit. Cops come and go. Sure, but people don't eat when they're around, and we gotta get people on our side. I heard you had a baby boy. Congratulations. Let's go. He was born yesterday and these guys already know his name! How should I take that? Take it as a sign. We made the right choice, relax. Mulatto's own men killed him, we can't trust anyone. - We gotta raise hell! - Cool it, Raffaele! The fuck I will! We wait 'til they kill another of us? We gotta find Savastano, he's our problem. Think we're not trying, Gypsy? You all gotta stay calm. We're buying information. We get killed if we're not careful, or if we don't know who's around us. You know what I see? Two guys shitting their pants. We're the strongest, we have an army. We mustn't be afraid. Fear is the only thing that can screw us. What a mess! I can't do all the work myself. Anyway, we'll have to leave here sooner or later. - We're safe here. - Who says? You? C'mon, give me a hand, let's clean up. Who the fuck are you to tell us what to do? See the fucking mess you got us into? Guys... I've been thinkin'. It's time to go back home. My father's home, ours, where you lived before this mess with the Savastanos. We gotta step back. Now, that we still have something to offer. Hello, Don Pietro. Hi, Patrizia. I still haven't thanked you for the new house. Do you feel safer? My brothers and sisters can't stand me anymore. And maybe they're right. They'll have no more problems for the rest of their lives, I give you my word. Thank you, Don Pietro. Enough of calling me "Don Pietro", what do you say? Your stuff has arrived. Should I see to it? Why don't you. We made a huge mistake, Don Pietro. - But we had no choice. - A man always has a choice. And you, like Scianel, made the wrong one. You took up with your father's killers. You sold your soul. Now, what do you want from me? Your forgiveness. Forgiveness and protection. - My spot... - It's never been yours. I'll give it back, Don Pietro. Explain something: in exchange for forgiveness you offer what's already mine? I'd have taken it myself, sooner or later. You have to earn forgiveness and protection, Gypsy. You gotta bring me that shit Ciro di Marzio. What's Avitabile want from me? Don't worry, sir, Mr. Avitabile just wants a chat. Move it! Are you sure Avitabile's here? He's inside. Where the fuck are you goin', you shit? You were supposed to scare him, but you fucked up. Leave, I'll take care of Avitabile. Venezuela? Alfredo, you killed a Councilman. Thank God Giuseppe didn't have us both killed. Now take that fucking plane and come back only when I say so, hear me? Okay. We won all the lots: piers, wharfs, accomodation facilities, the works! Nice work, Councilman! We ass-fucked them. Now I'll leave you with your family. You'll get a token of my gratitude. Thank you, see you soon. Goodbye. It's construction work for more than 200 million euros. Obviously we'll find a pretext to renegotiate and double it. Everything through a clean, immaculate company. Gennaro, without you and the money we make with your stuff, this would never have gone through. Together you and me are a powerhouse. Are you joking, Giuseppe? I'm the one who thanks you. You taught me to use my head. Don Giuseppe! It's okay, we got rid of him. And my brother's leaving right away. Tommaso... if he wasn't your brother, he'd be dead, know that? Yeah. Don Giuseppe, I've been with you for 20 years, my word: Alfredo will disappear, like the Councilman. It's all right, don't worry. Get out. Go! Everything's okay. - Anything we can take care of? - Just your wedding. I'm so pleased, for the contract, for the wedding... for the baby... and that I kept you from that slaughterhouse in Naples. You saved your life! Take it easy... Take care. - Bye, Giuseppe. - Bye, Dad. Ciro, all set. We doubled everything. We took on more lookouts. We give more money for information. A thousand euros if they hit a Savastano's man or anyone from the alley. Two thousand for a bigshot, ten thousand for a boss. Ciro, Gypsy might know where Savastano's hiding and he wants to meet you. Where? In the garage, like last time. Fine. Think, if we could find Don Pietro... It would all end. - Are they on foot or what? - Who knows where they are! They just got there, seems okay. - How many cars? - Two. He was too fuckin' scared to bring just two cars and a few men. So? What do we do? We pray for his soul. Well? Are they coming? The guys called me, they went back. Get in your cars, c'mon! Fast! What is it, little guy? - Hi, guys. - Hi, Bomber. Honey, I have a few things to do, I'll see you later. Get inside! Don't move from here! Come on! Don't worry. I did what I could, but that asshole's too careful. We tried and we'll try again. Relax, it doesn't change a fuck for you. We put the guys of the building commission closer to Dad's table. We move these two and the two journalists... Journalists too? Your father pays them! He's right, power must be shown. It's odd how we don't know a soul at our own wedding. But that's how it is. - I'm having a shower. - Gennaro... You just look at me, that's all, and even in the middle of all those people, it will be our wedding. You're so beautiful! Time is running out. You know my baby's on the way or do you mean the wedding? Your father's breaking up everything. It's just another way to say you're losing, Ciro. We're all losing, Gennaro, but you most of all. It's a fucking mess down South, cops everywhere, dead bodies all over, we're not selling anything. Do you think I'll have trouble selling my stuff? It's a big world, and I don't give a fuck about Secondigliano. That's crap, because you know whatever happens, it's not good for you. If your father loses, they'll say it's your fault, you destroyed everything. But if he wins, it means Dad had to come back to set things right. You have just one chance, that chance is me. There's not much time. Give me your best wishes, Ciro. I know you, you're like me. This thing's eating your gut, like poison. It's consuming you. Thanks just the same, Ciro. Gennaro, you're like me. - Hello. - Hello. Where's the bride? Will we be on time? Yes, don't worry. You look so good, Dad! Today I feel there's a crown on my head. The seating is perfect. - Really? Are you happy? - Yes. Now close your eyes. Close them! Open. They're so beautiful, Dad. Thank you. I should be thanking you, you know what this wedding means to me. I do. Get ready, don't keep the groom waiting! Okay, bye. Thank you. Good, Genny. Thank you so much, Don Aniello. - Best wishes. - Thank you. I'm entrusting you with what's most precious to me. I know. - Hi. - Hi. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Stop! Down! Hit the ground! Down! Don't move! Join hands and express your consent before God and His Church. I Gennaro, take you Azzurra, to be my wedded wife. In Jesus' grace I promise to be true to you, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. I will love you and honor you all the days of my life. I Azzurra, take you Gennaro, to be my wedded husband. In Jesus' grace I promise to be true to you, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health. I will love you and honor you all the days of my life. Is this all right? Looks like I've always been here. Like nothing's changed. Don Pietro, my task is finished now, you don't need a messenger any longer. But it's not true that nothing's changed. It seems like that. Instead everything's changed and we're not at the end of it. What do you mean? That I still need you. To do what? It's not over yet. Don Pietro, I'm not a soldier. This is a big house, I'd be pleased if you stayed here. Besides, it's even safer. So you don't have to go back and forth. It's more than 15 million cubic meters. - We have enough work for an army. - Good! Giuseppe, listen, they have been gone for that photo shoot for an hour, do I call them? Go ahead. Aniello, now I'd like to introduce the Councilman and another couple of people who count, all my people. Councilman! He'll never forgive me. Azzurra, today I'm the most important man in your life. And we even promised... to love and support each other all the days of our lives. In fact, I'm here. To us, my love. To the life awaiting us. Still nothing? No, nothing. They don't answer, should I worry? I'll call, invite the guests in, and check they're all sitting in the right places. Tommaso, we have to find those two jerks! Find the driver and photographers. I want to know where they are! You decide. I'm hungry, shall we order? Here I am! The kids are coming, they were stuck in traffic. Then let's have a toast! A toast! Cheers! - Cheers! - To the newlyweds! Those two assholes don't answer, I sent Tommaso. It's odd, something must have happened. - Are you Giuseppe Avitabile? - I am. Come with us please. - Why, what's wrong? - Our daughter? Your daughter has nothing to do with this. Come with us. Now? At my daughter's wedding? We have a warrant for your arrest. Please... Excuse me, I'm sure it's nothing. - No, wait... - Quiet! Talk to the lawyer! Let's go! Excuse me. Don't get up. Relax, it's nothing. It's a serious accusation, Luisa. Alfredo Natale pleaded manslaughter for the murder of the Councilman, meaning, involuntary, but he said Giuseppe was the instigator of the intimidation. I see, but how did they connect it? Hadn't that jerk left? I don't know, he was arrested this morning. Who? Who knew? We couldn't care less, because now it's just Natale's word against Giuseppe's. Without further proof, they have to release him, and fast. I'll leave. Bye, Luisa. Bye, Azzurra. I'm sorry about your wedding. Don't worry, just get him out. Don't worry Gennaro, Alfredo Natale knows nothing about the business and his brother isn't the type to talk. At least the companies are safe. Meantime, I'll set up a meeting fast, so you'll know what to do to run things. - Thank you, counselor. - Don't mention it. I'll be in touch.
