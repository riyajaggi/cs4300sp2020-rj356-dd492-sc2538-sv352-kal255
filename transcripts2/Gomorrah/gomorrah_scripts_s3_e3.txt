 Dad, the truck's here. OK. Yes, Dad. All right, got it. I'll call you when I'm done. Is this 22,500 euros? 1,500 a head. I want an extra 500 a head. - They don't have it. - I don't care. If they don't pay, they stay in the container, tell them. - All good? - Seems to be.

 What the fuck are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? What did I tell you? Italian piece of shit. - They already paid. - Ah, they already paid... I say who's paid and who hasn't. Got it? Now fix this mess. My son, wake up! Speak to me, my son! Come on, come on. Down. Stop. Go up.

 A bit higher. A bit more... that's it. Come on, I want you to play, to fight... Like that, take him down! Bravo! Again, from the top. Fight! Try again, come on! That's no good. Start again. Hi, Ciro. Get up! My son complained about you. - From the beginning. - I'm sorry. Men without any passions frighten me. You never seem to like anything. What I liked doesn't exist anymore, Valentin. I'm just fine with you, I do what you say and I don't have time to think about anything else. My son would like you to take care of the houses in Lyulin. Is that a problem for you? No, no problem. Don't ever go against him. All right. Move it. Keep going, guys. I wanna see a nice attack. That's it. C'mon. Clear out 7 and 15. Good morning. You gotta leave. Please, my husband is sick, he came home from the hospital yesterday, he's dying. Get your things and go. - Take it, please. - Get out. - Take it. - You don't understand. You don't understand! We haven't got anywhere to go. You don't understand. Don't you understand? You have to leave! Get out of here, or I'll kill you! I'll give you five minutes. Five minutes! C'mon, show your passports. Get out. - Faster! - Passports. - Quickly! - Get your passports ready. - Passports! - Come on, quicker! Move it! Quickly! Passport! Quick. Move it. You can put your things here. This is the kitchen. We'll bring you food to cook. You can't go out shopping and you can't leave. Understood? Is that clear? You can't go out. I'm in charge here! Will you let me call home? To Albania. Please. I don't understand your language. Phone call. - A phone call, please. - No. - Please. - I don't understand you. - No phone calls. - Please. - Please, be kind to me. - No phone calls! - Please! - No phone calls! - No phone calls! - Please... I don't understand! Keep her locked in there! Yes, Mladen. Of course. Italians? All right. - Hi, Ciro. - Is Mladen upstairs? A vodka, please. How are things? Good. And a whiskey. Ah, you're here. Have they arrived? Why, are you in a hurry? They're on their way. How much are they buying? - 100,000 euros. - Payment? Immediately, on the nail. Do you know them? Yeah. Fellow countrymen of yours. Take them into the VIP room and I'll watch them from here. Who are you? Big Brother? The agreement was clear. I won't deal with Neapolitans. I won't deal... You're very weird. You don't drink, you don't fuck... You live in a hotel that would disgust even an Albanian whore. You're scared of your fellow countrymen. I don't know what the fuck my father sees in you. Now piss off. Enzo! Enzo's here. Hi, Ciro. Let me see the money. Move it, Tatiana. Hurry up. What's the matter with the money? Is there a problem? Is something wrong? I'll change it into leva for you. Get back to work. Mladen? Their money's no good. Are you calling me a fool? You asked for my opinion and I gave it to you. Do what you want. This fuckin' wop thinks he can order me around. You're going against me, huh? They're friends of mine, their money's good. If it's good for you, it's good for everyone. Don't turn your back on me, fuck! Come back here! Listen up, moron. Now you'll go back to my office, you'll count the takings like you always have. And cut out all the bullshit, OK? Now piss off! Shitbag. Get in. Brother! What are you doing in this shithole? I'm not your brother. What do we call you, Uncle? - What the fuck are you doing here? - What? Are you kidding me? Mladen said to wait for you here. We've got the money in a car parked at the airport, to be safe. If you have problems, call him and sort them out. There are no problems. Let's bounce. Let's go. How can you live here? It's a place like any other. I couldn't live away from Naples. - Where's this parking structure? - Wait a moment. Holy mother... Hurry up. Turn left a bit further up, where that sign is. So you really learned their language? Of course, he works here. You've got a good head on your shoulders. I don't understand them when they talk, they yap like dogs. Let's hurry it up, I didn't come to chat. Tell him where to go and I'll follow. I'm coming with you. I'm glad. Gimme the keys, I'll drive. You know the way. What the fuck's this one doing? Move! Where's the money? - What are you doing? - It's fake. The Saint said that only someone who's worthless kills for money, real men don't do it. You have to figure out which is which. Do you think there's a difference? My family's done what no one's ever done for Naples. My grandfather performed miracles like San Gennaro. We created the System. You understand my pedigree? Say what you like, but if you're not respectful, you're not a man. If you want to screw someone, first you gotta know them. But you didn't consider who I am, you underestimated me. And now you've got a problem. Your grandfather would never have ended up in a shitty situation like this. If you're gonna shoot, shoot. I won't kill you, but you gotta tell me the truth. Call your friends, get them to pick you up and go back to Naples. I don't want to see you ever again. If you get homesick one day, remember, in Forcella we make the best pizza in Naples. Are the five kilos of heroin ready for our Neapolitan clients? Quick! Put it in. Put it in. Hi, Ciro. There's a car outside full of money, it's the Neapolitans'. Did they buy the stuff? I didn't give it to them because their cash was fake, but that's not the biggest problem. They made a deal with Mladen. A deal? For what? I don't understand. Mladen called them, he asked them to bring fake bills. He said if they brought 100,000 in fake euros, he'd give them the stuff for free. Why? To frame me, to make it seem like I was in on it with them and to screw me. Do you think you're worth 100,000 euros to my son? I'm not worth that. You're worth that for your son. He's convinced I want to take his place. If I didn't have a son, I'd want one like you, but I've already got a son, Ciro. I'm sorry. Me too. If I had a son I'd tell him to his face when he's being an arsehole. Out. Out! - Hi, Ciro. - Hello. The fuck are you waiting for? Get in. Quick! Get down. I don't understand. It's the same thing. MACEDONIA-ALBANIA BORDER Be good. COMING UP
