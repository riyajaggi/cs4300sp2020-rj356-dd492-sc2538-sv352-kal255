 ONE YEAR LATER During a financial crisis like this one, the banks ought to help. I went through the paperwork. Your checking account was 80,000 euros overdrawn last month. Can't be helped, I play it by ear. Well, I think you can choose an easier way. Besides, this is a prestige property. I have a client who's interested in investing. I think we can come to a solution. Gennaro. Hi, Gegè.

 Well? He gave in immediately, it's ours. Good job. This time we can't pay for the goods right after the sale. Why, is there a problem? A friend of mine's having a tough time, he needs cash. - How's our liquidity? - About 700,000. - I'll need it all. - That would clean us out. Don't worry, you gotta invest money to make money, you taught me that. - When do you want it? - My friend gets in tonight. See you, Gegè. See you, Gennaro. Good to see you, bro'.

 Bro'... I missed you, bro'! Let's go. Joaquin, this is Gegè. Pleasure. All good? He's a friend, the best accountant in the world. Genny likes to exaggerate. If it wasn't for his family, I'd be an unemployed guy from the South. Now, tell me about your issue. It's cool, he can be trusted. The sons of bitches are already in Rome. Who are they? They belong to a gang that's at war with me. If they go back to Honduras with a deal, I'll be in deep shit. Like I wrote, I got lots of Calabrian friends. I'll make a couple of calls to see what's up, OK? All right. Let's go, Gegè. You need to relax. They're taking everyone out. You're with me tonight. I can't get away, I'm still waiting. Tell Giulia, I'll speak to her later. Yes. Bye. I know it's not your thing, but it's an emergency. What's going on? I spoke to my friend, if we wanna sort this out we gotta do it tonight and I'll need a hand. - Is there a problem? - No, not at all. I'm always available, you know that. I know, I just wanted to hear you say it. And them? What do they want in exchange? Our stuff at 23 a kilo. Your friends were selling it at 29. Friends... that six grand difference will cost those scumbags dearly. Let's go. Wait here. Darling, I can't right now. I need you inside. We gotta hurry, the cleaners get here in two hours. - You ready? - Yeah. There's a rag in the bathroom. Move it, Gegè! Onto the next one, brother. OK. Gegè, are you OK? Come. Make a video of Joaquin. Hurry up. Arseholes, sons of bitches! Wherever you go, wherever you are, this is how you'll end up, you shitbags! The devil has arrived, faggots! We'll cut off all your heads, motherfuckers! Now stop, my friend. Get the torch from the backpack. Sons of bitches are heavy! OK, this is it. - Pass it on to me. - This one? Yeah. The other one, bro'. Untie the rope, Gegè. Here's good. Give me the torch. Fuck you, cowards. Go, Gegè. I'm really sorry about Giulia. What you're doing's not good for you. It's giving me opportunities I never would have had. What happened tonight? Can you tell me? I had to go to dinner with him with an important client. I never ask questions, I'm on your side in any case. But you can always pull out, you just have to want to. When you get back we'll do a nice dinner together. I'll be back in two days. Bye. Patrizia, playing hard to get. What can I do for you? Lady Scianel wants you to take a message to Marinella. Saying what? That Lady Scianel was pissed off, she didn't like seeing her son in a casket. - I know. - Now there's the trial. Your friend can give us a nice present, if she behaves. I don't know where she is. I'm sure you can find out. I don't think Marinella can do something like that. Talk to her. We all need a second chance. I'll see what I can do. Do what you want, but if Lady Scianel is convicted, it's on you. Take care of it. He looks like a prince. Your father still isn't king. - You upset? - No. There. Azzurra, you need to relax. With the money your father made off me, he should make a statue of me. You don't know him well. Do you trust me? Hello? Gegè. You remember about today? My father-in-law's coming home. Yes. We'll let him spend a couple of hours with the family, then you come at two. He's a son of a bitch. Keep me out of it, he needs to think it's all his. Perfect. - Did you prepare those papers? - Yes. See you later. Want to come meet Grandpa, Pietro? Let's go. With the fucking house arrest, the only thing I'll have is time to spend with my grandson. Hi, Giuseppe. Come here, Grandpa's boy! He's so beautiful! You're so cute, you little rascal! Are these my figureheads? Yes, the companies you own are in their names, sir. If I was a sir, I wouldn't have done a year in jail. Is all this mine? Exactly, I'll show you the shares you have in each. Why, Gennaro? Why what? With all the people we could have used to manage this stuff for us, you had to go and get a kid from where you're from who thinks learning proper Italian is enough to shed the stench of poverty. I needed someone clean who nobody knew. The magistrate knew all your guys. You know what they say? Dogs only respond to the voice of one master, and he's yours. There are no dogs here, and now you're the only master in your house. Gegè, explain the situation to him. Before going to prison, you were worth 60 million euros. The judicial seizures reduced that to 1.5 million euros. I already knew that. Contained in a single secret limited liability company. You now own 17 companies, either fully or as a partner. A total value of 97 million euros. You have no idea, but to be locked up in there is hell, then, when you get home you see that life has gone on, but you don't fit in, you feel like a stranger even with your own family. And everyone you loved, you see them as strangers. You're not in jail anymore. You want your consultants? Tomorrow, Gegè will step aside. Do you want some new figureheads? We'll go to the notary and sort it out. We can do whatever you want, as far as I'm concerned. But never tell me I'm a stranger. I'm your daughter's husband and the father of your grandson. Don't ever forget that. If there's something I don't want to forget, it's precisely that. Hello? It's Patrizia. I'm glad you're well. I'm not calling to say hi. A mutual friend's got it into her head to make trouble. I need to see you as soon as possible to explain. I'll see you tonight. Where? I'll text you. Hi, Gennaro. Come in. Want a coffee? Thanks. What's wrong? Don't you like where I am? You chose it. They're over there, my brothers and sisters. When they see me, they walk the other way, I can only see them from here. Soon, not even that. Why? My brother left school to get custody of our sisters. Now I heard he's lost his job. The social workers have already been there once. Next time they'll take them away. They'll put them in a foster home and I won't be able to see them. What do you want from me? A job for my brother. Honest. But not in Naples. My family needs to get out of this hell. Your brother's got a job tomorrow. He can't find out who got him the job. All right, so now tell me what our friend wants. Scianel sent a message, she's got an offer for Marinella. She wants me to find her. What do I do? What she told you to. I'd feel better if you were close to her. Good evening, can I help you? I'm looking for Irene. - Irene? - Coming! I don't regret it, I'd do it again, a hundred times over. Tell that to that bitch Scianel. And what did you solve, Marinella? I got justice. There's fuck all the dead can do with justice. And you're telling me this? Have you forgotten what you made me do to Lelluccio? I don't understand you. Marinella... she can find you the same way I did, only the next one won't come with this. As for me, I work for myself, I mind my own business. You working for the Savastanos? I said what I came to say. Sooner or later, you gotta make her eat dirt. You gotta promise me. 30 now and 30 later. It's a not a present from me. You'd have liked to give it, so it is from you. Yeah, but it's not my money. Half my life I heard my father pissed about money that wasn't there, the second half, I tried to figure out how the fuck it works. I'm telling you, money's not worth shit and it doesn't matter where you get it. What matters is that nobody can take this day away from your daughter. - Silvano? - Yes? - Silvano Romini? - Yes. - She must be Giulia? - Who are you? A guy who can't sleep anymore. Let go of her! Why? She needs to know too, that everyone in my house, everyone who was close to me seems different and it's driving me crazy! - That's also your friend's fault. - Dad, what does he mean? Explain it to your daughter, for her own good. And explain it to me too! I don't know anything. I don't believe it, I want the truth. And tell that to that other faggot Gegè. - Didn't you go to London? - Giulia's in danger. What are you talking about? - He stopped us on the way. - Who? Your client's father-in-law. - What does he want? - His son-in-law's head. - Why? - How the fuck should I know? Because he hates him? Because you tried to rip him off? When you get mixed up with these people you don't come out clean. I'm afraid for Giulia. What do we do? What do you want from me? Gennaro's screwing me. I can feel it, I know it. Isn't that right? I want to know how. If I tell you, Gennaro will kill me. And if you don't, I'll kill you and your friend. Gegè, you're very capable. Or else Gennaro wouldn't have taken you on, and I would have found out immediately how he's screwing me. You need to decide now who your master is. This hotel is very beautiful. It shows. - How long did you talk to him? - He was open to it. - Did he give you any trouble? - No, not at all. See how amazing? The best view is this one, bro'. Show us the photos, Gegè. What a classy hotel. Pure quality. It's the most incredible deal of my life. That right? Don't speak, with your mouth you either eat or you speak. Shut up. Ladies... Cheers! Tomorrow we'll sign over 25% of the resort to you and after the shipment arrives, the other 25%. For a total value of... Gegè! Are you asleep? Sorry, you were saying? How much do we get with this hotel? Ten million euros. More than what I owed you. And you're left with a piece of real estate that we both own. Cool, bro'. I've never invested in Europe, but I think it's a good idea. 'Til death, bro'. Always. Always. Captain! Everything OK, Gegè? All good. See you tomorrow. - Azzurra, where have you been? - Hi, baby. Mum woke up and Dad wasn't in bed. He went out. Where did he go? He didn't want to tell me. Gennaro, do you think something's wrong? No, it's all good. Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday to Pietrino. Happy Birthday to you! Blow! Wait here, I'll go get your present. Come with me, it's a heavy present. Hurry up. He named it after his son. What? The shell corporation that Gennaro created when I was in jail to screw me. And there's a shipment of stuff that he wants to sell all by his fuckin' self. It's not business for our people in Rome or even for the clans in Naples. Son of a bitch! He's doing it to all of us. What are you going to do now? We'll wait till the shipment gets in and then I'll get him off my arse for good. COMING UP
