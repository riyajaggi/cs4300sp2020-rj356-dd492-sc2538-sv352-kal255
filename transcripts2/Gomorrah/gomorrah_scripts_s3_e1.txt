 Is it done?
 I'll handle it now.
 Come to daddy.
 It must be him.
We gotta find that shit Ciro Di Marzio...
 ...and each one of his men, before Genny
asks us why his father died and we're still alive.
 Go get the bicycles, the big ones.
 One for my 9 years old son and
one for my 7 and a half.
 Hurry up.
 Let's go.
 It's been 24 hours now!
- It's alright.
 Bullshit!
- I said it's alright!
 It's not, I need to know!
 What happened to Pietro?
 What's important is that you stay calm.
 Pietro has been shot,
but he's alright.
 Now it's all in my hands and I need your help
to avoid a war.
 I wanna see him!
- Not now!
 I'll be here when you get out.
 What you mean "when you get out"?
 I need to talk to my father,
he's nowhere to be found.
 Be good.
 Let's go.
 Guys, have you seen Fernando?
 Come here.
 Have you seen Fernando?
 Ciro Di Marzio disappeared.
- Those shits ran away.
 Lello left with his whole family.
 Pitbull collected an old debt
and left last night.
 Fernando is at his sister's
but he's about to leave.
 Guys... we gotta get them right away.
 Uncle Fernà, I'm hungry!
- Wait a second.
 Where the fuck is it...
 I'm gonna kill you and your kids!
Move!
 Wait here.
 More pasta?
- Ok.
 Move.
 Careful what you do.
 Fernà, run!
 You piece of shit!
- Where's your fucking boss?
 I don't know,
we split the money and parted ways!
 You're gonna get him, I don't care how!
- But how...
 How?? I'll throw your whole family
off this roof right now!
 You shit!
 I'm supposed to bring him a passport.
 Good.
 Patrì.
 What the fuck did you say?
 Where do we meet?
 Ok.
 Get out, Patrì.
 I wanna know where my father is.
 Is he wounded?
 Is he wounded or dead?!
 What??
 Either he lived or you would've died too.
 That's what a good soldier does!
 I shouldn't have listened to him.
 If he'd let me in the graveyard with him,
he might be still alive.
 I would die for my family.
 I'll find the bastard who killed him
and blow his head off.
 Ciro Di Marzio.
 How did Ciro Di Marzio know?
- He got him followed, like he did with Patrizia.
 Patrizia was smart enough to know,
while you didn't see shit.
 Maybe they were already inside waiting,
 'cause someone told 'em you and Pietro had to talk.
 You know what they say, Malammore?
 The King's deputy can become the King's worst enemy.
 They also say the only one not weeping
at the King's funeral is the son.
 Because this son is weeping on the inside.
 Anyway, the son's in command now.
 And the first thing he's gotta do is
tell friends from enemies.
 This one.
 I got my things ready,
I'll pick everything up after the funeral.
 No one's throwing you out.
 If you wanna stay, we'll find you a job.
- I wasn't working for the System.
 I was with Pietro, that's it.
 Do what you want.
- You need to get away from here.
 You have a wife and a newborn baby.
 This is not a place to live... it's a place to die.
 It wasn't Ciro Di Marzio who killed my father.
 It was the poison we all have inside.
 We know it's there... but we can't spit it out.
 What's got into your head?
- I just want peace in your neighborhood.
 You lied when you said Don Pietro was fine
and you're lying now.
 I've been 30 years with them,
obeying good orders and bad orders.
 I bought me a house in hell for them,
by killing a young kid.
 I'm sick of that,
I can't be under them anymore.
 You're wrong... what happened here
taught us one thing:
 You don't touch the Savastanos.
 We're ready.
 My mother was 16 when I was born.
My father, I never knew him.
 I'm a mistake, son of "malammore"*
(*wrong love)
 Me and Don Pietro were like brothers
when we were kids.
 But then he became a father to me.
He always said:
 "No one will give you anything, you gotta take it".
And so we did, together.
 Now we gotta start to behave, because he's here, watching us!
 All the time!
 Fernando called,
we need to go.
 I know where he is.
 Hey, I'll be home tonight.
 Kiss the baby for me.
 I'll see you later.
 The door must be open
but it must look like it's closed, got it?
 I must kill that rat myself.
 You stay here,
in case those motherfuckers show up.
 Where will you go now?
- I don't know.
 I also killed my own daughter.
 I'm gonna have to pay for that.
 Ciro...
 Good morning, Don Aniello.
- My condolences, Genny.
 Thank you.
 Our condolences.
 Sorry to disturb you in such a bad time.
 He is Elia Capaccio
and this is his brother, Ferdinando.
 Do they belong to you, Don Aniello?
- They're my nephews.
 And this is Don Eduardo Arenella.
- Nice meeting you.
 My pleasure, Don Gennaro.
 We called this meeting
'cause we're a bit worried.
 With your father dead and you living in Rome,
Secondigliano and Scampia are like a ticking bomb.
 It may go off at any moment.
 North Naples could fall into anarchy.
 Another war would be bad for everyone.
 We've always been quiet
in our own house.
 Dad always said Sanità and Maddalena
are the richest districts, is that true?
 We can't complain.
 But he loved the Spanish District and Forcella.
 He said only there you could feel the true Naples.
 Your father was right.
 But the port is the real heart of this city,
 it can open us the doors to the whole world.
 Now... the war in my house is over
and I'm left in charge.
 We never looked into your business, we've always
been respectful... now you gotta do the same.
 That's what we wanted to know.
- There's one more thing actually.
 The "white"... who'll get it?
- My stuff?
 From Rome down, it's just for me and for you, ok?
 I'll take your word for it.
 Gennà, you're here.
- I'm here.
 Daddy's boy...
let's go.
 All good?
- Yes.
 When do you have to go back?
- Tomorow.
 Come.
 We're home.
- Why are we here?
 You made me a Prince,
I have to treat him like such.
 Come on.
 Gennà... it's beautiful!
 How did you do it?
 I met an old friend, Gegè.
 He studied in England
but he's from Secondigliano.
 He's No.1 for real estate deals.
 Is there a little room for Pietro?
 He's too little,
he needs to stay by his father.
 My brother killed himself in prison.
 He'd just recanted the accusations against Don Giuseppe.
- I'm sorry.
 Without him, all charges will drop.
 Don Giuseppe could already be home if...
- If what?
 The judge is not buying the suicide.
- What then?
 More investigations.
- He can't hold him this long.
 He can hold him with charges
of belonging to a criminal organization.
 At least until the Finance Police has finished the inquiry.
- Gennà, can they do it?
 Yes, because of the evidence tempering.
- How long will it take?
 The lawyer said about one year.
 Does Don Giuseppe know about all this?
- Yes.
 How did he take it?
- Bad... but he knows he can count on you.
 My father didn't leave Naples.
 My father is dead.
 I had him killed.
 He wanted me under him in Secondigliano,
he'd never accepted otherwise.
 He was going insane, dead people everywhere.
 We were in danger ourselves.
 I did the only thing I could do:
 protect my family.
 I paid the price,
as you did yourself.
 Now it's just us, Gennà... that's what counts.
