I thought this free trip might be a scam. Do I have to buy something from you? No, just talk about our supermarkets. Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

 That's all of it. We didn't even lose one gram. That's why Don Giuseppe loves you. C'mon, move it! Give that kid the Ninja Turtles! The ball! Hey kid, you don't have anything? They ran out of balls and I don't like dolls. See this? It's real crocodile. You're invincible when you wear it. Really? See how far I've gotten? It's not because I'm good! - It's this talisman. - And you? I don't need it anymore.

 Thanks a lot. Wait. This protects you only if you behave, if you start thinking you're a big shot, it won't work, okay? - What's the bracelet? - Let's see it! Lift your arm, show me. Hello? On my way. What's all this ruckus? Prince gave the kids presents. He comes up with a new one every week. He used to scrape by on Conte's paycheck and now he's got money to burn? Didn't I tell you? It's the best! A guy like you can get six kilos out of one. I charge you 20% less than I do the Alliance. And you don't have to split it. I don't get this system of yours... What's to get? You buy all together and then split the take in equal parts, right? So? I think it's crap, because you're letting the others make money. I say, the one who sells the most, earns the most. Gennaro, what do you want from me? I told you, Gabriele, I want a friend in that snake pit. Besides, no one's got a head like yours. Prince, you gotta be number one in that Alliance. I carry just one flag, it's not Ciro's or yours. It's mine. And I want to see it wave when the wind blows. Okay? I have to work on this stuff first, we'll make it three, maybe even four. It's good. Tell Malamore not to worry, Ciro's time will come. We can hurt him and the Alliance without killing him. Prince, the guy making the most money, has no protection. We'll start with him. I'll tell him, Don Pietro. Can I say something? After you kill Prince, what happens? If anything happens to any Alliance guy, it carries your name, you'll declare war. - I think... - You're not paid to think. - I say this for you. - Get out. From the Seven Buildings, 2,872,000 which brings this month's take to 7,427,200. Net of the managing expenses and 5% for petty cash for contingencies, makes... 1,175,973 for the 15% shares and 371,370 for the alley's 5%. Prince, you're the best! How much longer do we keep getting just 5%? I piss on their faces! Let's go. Pieces of shit, they should kiss where we walk. You made more than anybody this week. You're getting better than us this way. Oh, yeah? Then I'll keep some cash for myself next week! If you haven't already! What's that mean? If you have a problem, say it. He means you're good, Gabriele. You and me have to talk business. Me and Rosario want to invest, to launder the money. We could do it together. Ciro, this proposal is an honor for me. But I manage my money alone. Okay, but think about it. The more we launder, the better. Bye, Gabriele! Bye, Ciro! - Like it? - You bought another one? It was a steal. You're hungry for cars? I went hungry as a kid. I have a surprise for you too. Step up. - Ready? - Yes. You're crazy! - I'm crazy about you. She's yours. - Mine? What do I do with her? Will she fetch a ball? She's beautiful like you, a creature from another world. I'll show her to you. - Come on, come on! - Don't, no! You say we're alike? - You think I'm unhappy? - Why? Because she's unhappy, she'd like to run, instead of being chained up. She's much better off than in the circus. She doesn't have to be a clown, because I respect her. Know what you are? A good soul dropped into a screwy head. We want him in with us? Why? Because he has a good head. Isn't our head enough? Are you jealous? I don't like him. You don't like him, but you pocketed 1,750,000 thanks to him. His dealing spot's the biggest one. No, from one kilo he can make three. Or maybe four, but he tells us three and keeps the rest, that's how he can act like a millionaire with that black whore. We want him in with us, with our money? I don't like these things. I don't care if he skims, he's better than you and all of us. Never utter those words again. That's how trouble starts, and I want no trouble. Got that? It's settled. - Someone's here! - No way. I swear! Sorry, man. Your dick's gone soft? Seeing your face! Son of a bitch! It's not looking good. - Dwarf's busted your balls? - Not only him. You're busting too many balls, you spend too much. - Is it a sin? - No! But you know how it is... The house, the cars, the parties for the neighborhood kids... Now even a panther! They think you're making money outside the system. I make the same money as the others, but theirs is stuck to their hands. Gabriele, listen to me... I care for you, and I say if you grow too tall in this world, someone's always there to cut you down. No one will touch me, I make money for everyone. They'd just hurt their wallets. You'd better get yourself some protection! You tell him too! Take my advice, sell a few cars... And that animal too... what's it to you? I don't want to mourn you. Neither does she. Isn't that right? Don't listen to him. The money's my protection. Money won't stop a bullet. - What's going on? - I'm done! - What? - You heard me, I'm done. I only serve my family. - You knew the terms. - It's not for me! You can't walk out on this job. - Get back there and stop this. - Or you'll shoot me? Patrizia, he gave you his trust, you know where he lives, what he wants to do... If he feels betrayed, he'll find someone else to kill you! I know they're worth more, but this is all I can give you. There isn't a line like before. The keys are in the ignition. See you. You're feeling better now? Now I feel like her, chained up. Chains kill her, but they save you. We were better off when Conte was here, less money but no fear. I'm not afraid, you know that. I'll take a shower and go to work, will you take me? There's nothing to be afraid of, Azmera. I'd like you to take me. Good morning, Lady Azmera. Lady Azmera... The meal's here for the little one, will you take care of it? Careful! I want you to handle this. There's a place she won't bother anyone, take her there. I can't stand seeing her all chained up. - When do you finish? - Late, at closing. What? You're the boss! Right, I set the example! Put someone outside here, ok? We're ready, we have men and arms. But it's not easy like before, Prince took on protection. Why now? We decide to rub him out and he gets protection, isn't that strange? I don't know. Maybe he's pissed someone off... Or one of us warned him. What the fuck happened to Patrizia? Why didn't she come? She's not well, don't think bad. Cut the bullshit, Malamore! I have to talk to her, look her in the eyes. - What the fuck...? Why? - Get out of here. No, my family's here. Why should I? You didn't want to go back to him, now he doesn't trust you anymore. Patrizia, I won't leave you here! But why? He thinks I'm a rat? The thought is enough. He says he wants to see you, but how will it end up? I'll take care of your family. Patrizia, come here! It's me! - You wanted to see me? - Where were you? - I was busy. - Respect me. I do, I'm risking my life for you. I deserve a little respect too, even if I'm a nobody. What do you want from me? I want you to really understand what I'm doing. Sit down. I may lose this war, but I have to fight it, because this is my home. Everything I've done in a lifetime is here. I have nothing to lose, all I've got is my dignity and I won't see it flushed down this toilet. Now do you see? So, when you think, think about this too. If you're my eyes and ears, you gotta think like me. - Need anything? - Go back to your duty. It really pisses me off we gotta pay Gennaro! What should piss you off is when Prince cuts Genny's stuff, he fucks us, you know? - Forget it. - No, go on! If this gets out, I'll wring your neck. He says he cuts it to three, you believe that? See how he has all that money, jewels, the cars, the house and the shop for that whore? With our money. We'd better wake up before fuckin' Prince screws us all. This is an aggression, like I told you. They're ex Savastano, they're not like us, we can't trust 'em. We gotta respond. These shits need to see they can't shoot or offend us. - How? - We get revenge. We shove the gunfire and bad-mouthin' up Dwarf's ass. Can't let them think we're takin' it. Dwarf wants to screw me, he's waiting for some bullshit. But I'm doin' no bullshit, I'll fuck him first. I can't swallow this thing. A member of the Alliance accused me of stealing, he offended my woman, then someone shot up her shop. We don't know who did the shooting. It's your man who says Dwarf said something. I've had it, it's too much, he didn't say those things just in front of my man. This time Dwarf talked in front of Trak. For the sake of this Alliance I can't lie. It's true. Hear that, Ciro? It's all true. We have a code of respect and he broke it. If it weren't for me, Dwarf would be dead now. I don't want blood, but you have to make amends. Or else that means all of you in here think like Dwarf. So there's no alliance here, just a place to spit shit on others. I want no part. I'm gettin' out. Why are you looking at me? He's my brother, if he goes, I go too, we're the same thing. Ciro, if they go, we'll lose the best money-making spots. This fuck up can really cost us. She left the shop keys, she's not back and doesn't answer her phone. - You have to find her, Luciano. - We will, Prince. Don Ciro's here. Go look there! It's all okay! What the fuck are they doin' here? It's all okay, don't worry. - You gotta go. - Huh? I'm sorry, we can't do a thing. What is it, don't you know me? That's from the Alliance, Manolo will handle your spot from now on. You know why. You've got a great head, Prince, that's why I like you. Others would have taken revenge, but not you. You asked them to make amends in front of everyone. Then they saw they could get to Dwarf, that's why Trak ratted. You had others get your revenge for you. But now you gotta show me you were in good faith, and this thing ends here. Call back the dogs you unleashed, or this will end bad for everyone. What do you say? You're beautiful. Tell the truth, some kid's got his eye on you? - Dad will kill him. - No, no one. I'm kidding. Like this one? Put it on. Wait... - What's this? - It's Mom's. Do you mind? Ciro... In my house... - In front of everyone. - It's your fault, you didn't listen. - Whose fuckin' side are you on? - They were all against you. We wanted a democracy? My vote's worth one. But I'm not like all the others, have you forgotten what I did for you? Are you threatening me? Don't you dare do that again. I wasn't threatening you, I wanted to remind you, because you're leaving me alone, and I never left you alone, ever! My blood's on your hands. They dragged me into this and maybe Prince and Trak did the shooting to fuck me, but I have to save face, I have to kill them. - No. - They gotta pay. - I have to kill them. - I've wrapped it up. You have to do what I say. This thing ends here. I didn't shoot up the shop. I swear on my daughter's life. I was wrong, I have to apologize... to Prince and his girlfriend and I hope you accept my apologies. This thing's over and I propose Dwarf take his dealing spot back. Anyone disagree? That's enough. They're all pissed off, even if Dwarf got his spot back, he's lost face. The others are pissed off, they hoped to take his spot and Ciro's fighting to keep them together. With all due respect, if anything happens to one of them now, it doesn't bear your name. See? When you think in the right direction, you think good. With this it makes 70,200. Okay. Hi, guys. Hello, Don Rosario. - We're happy it's all resolved. - Me too. I want you all to get a bonus, each and every one, 10% extra. I'm payin'. Will you do it? - Okay! - For everyone! And Manolo's share goes to his wife. Why? Now it's all resolved. Get rid of this shit. Hello, Prince. I can't stand seeing you like this, you gotta get up. I'm going to feed the animal, want to come? It's like flying! - Like it? - Wow! I'll give it to you. Get the meat. Forgive me, Prince. They threatened Susy, I had no choice, we're expecting a baby. Forgive me. It's okay, don't worry. - Hello, Prince. - Don Pietro. Nothing personal, but I have to start somewhere to straighten things out. You're wrong, you'll just complicate them. I have dealings with Genny. It's the truth. He passes his stuff to me to help me grow and turn the tables when the time's right. Call him if you like. He's leaving for Honduras today. - You're one of Genny's cards? - If you prefer... I thought my son didn't give a shit. Know what? You're worth more for my game.
