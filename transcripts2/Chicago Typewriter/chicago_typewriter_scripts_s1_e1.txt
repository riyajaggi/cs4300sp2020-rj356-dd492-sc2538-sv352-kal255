 Quickly. Let's take a look. Hey, show me your face. You look familiar. Take off your glasses. -My goodness. -My apologies. I can't show my face. Are you out of your mind, punk? What's this? -I make my living with it. -You rat. Hey!

 Hey. I also use my hand to make a living. -You piece of-- -I found him! How dare you run away after blowing my boss' two billion? -Please don't kill me! -Today's your lucky day, okay? Hey! -Please don't hit me. -You punk. Hey. Hey! Get him! I'm sorry, but you can't hit my head. This is the real source of my livelihood. Who are you, you jerk? Ignorance is not a virtue.

 If you have time to fight, you should read some books. You're back, sir. Did you get some good news material? Yes, I did, Ms. Kang. Should we get you food? -Let me organize the material first. -Yes, sir. A writer writes not only with his brain, but also with his hands, his feet, and his butt. Sometimes, he even disguises himself to become a character in his own work. What do I do when I get stuck? I don't know. Perhaps the idea of getting stuck was created by whiners as an excuse to drink. These aren't my words. I'm simply quoting the actor and writer Steve Martin. I agree with him entirely. MR. KIM, THE HOMELESS MAN It's five minutes before Mr. Han finishes work. Writing is a test of your strength. I am trying to stay fit by controlling my diet and exercising regularly. But I couldn't give up strawberry shortcakes and cocoa with lots of sugar and milk. But I only eat them after submitting my work. It's like a reward for myself. Cigarettes? Are there still old-fashioned writers who smoke cigarettes? I quit smoking two years ago. Cinnamon sticks are an excellent alternative. Sir. I sent the script. The copyright lawyer is scheduled at 1:30 p.m. At 2:30 p.m., your doctor will visit for your regular health check-up. Then, you have to finish a short story for a new magazine-- Ms. Kang. Yes, sir. The garden... looks too dreary. Should we raise a deer? The English translation of writer Han Se-ju's novel, Unfair Game, has been listed on The New York Times bestseller section. According to KGL Management, who manages Mr. Han's international copyrights, the book entered the chart just five days after its official release and is recently in its fifth printing. In response to the book's enthusiastic reception abroad, the writer will tour seven American cities and five European cities. Thank you. I liked it. May I have a photo? -Hello. -Hello. I really liked his writing. I want him to sign my book. Oh, my God. Thank you. BACKSPACE Do you know this gun's nickname? What? What are you saying? Do you know this gun's nickname? No, I don't. What is it? They say that the sound of its gunshot is similar to a typewriter, so it got the nickname Chicago Typewriter. That's cool. So? A pen is stronger than a knife. A typewriter is stronger than a gun. So? You should write something good. Don't write to gain fame and women. Write something magnificent. Hey, buddy. PLEASE SEND ME TO HAN SE-JU STALKER BESTSELLER UNFAIR GAME UNFAIR GAME, SOON TO BE A MOVIE I love the smell of new books. Are you getting more copies? The one I have is for reading. This is for display, and this is for keeps. You don't own an apartment. Are you planning on building a castle with all those books by Han Se-ju? Enthusiastic fans change the world, you know. The world needs more of them. Stop with that nonsense. In addition to being an awesome writer, he's so handsome too. His handsome face could even save a country. That's why he's accused of writing his books with his abs and selling them with his face. What kind of jerk said that? Unfairly, I mean. He's unfairly accused of that. I left out the unfairly part. I made a terrible mistake. Just hit me. Go ahead. Can you let go of me? Hello. This is Do Anything, the errand service agency where anything is possible. You need something picked up from Incheon International Airport? Yes, I'm on my way. If you ever run into that jerk, tell them that I might squeeze all the juices out of them if I ever catch them. I hope that person isn't you. She's definitely not normal. She's so crazy about that writer. Is she the one who buys every edition of every book that Han Se-ju writes? That's right. Who is she? -Is she an editor? -No. Jeon Seol. She's legendary with fans, like her name. She's a legendary fan fiction writer too. Back in high school, all the other kids wrote fan fictions for singers. No one had ever dared to before, but she wrote fan fiction for a writer. She was a daredevil among fans of writers. She was a real pioneer who did things that no one had ever done before. Even as a child, she was incredibly persistent. I'm going to marry a writer. -Why? -Why? I don't know. I've always wanted to, for as long as I can remember. Thanks to her father, who used to be a mountain climber, she's amazing at rock climbing. She's also a master of various martial arts and can beat even the strongest young men. During her teenage years, she even dreamed of becoming an Olympian, but gave up for personal reasons. Despite the prejudice that athletes aren't very smart, she got into veterinary school after only a year of preparation. That's incredible. Everyone expected her to become a successful vet after graduating. Did she give up again? Why would she do that? Again, for personal reasons. A sad story, really. What a waste. Her parents must have been so disappointed. If she had parents, the story wouldn't have ended so sadly. -Is she an orphan? -You could say that. Anyway, she's had all kinds of part-time jobs in order to make a living. That's how she earned her nickname, the legendary part-timer. She seems to become a legend every time she starts something. That's amazing. It's not amazing at all. More like she's lost her clever mind. Now, she's nothing more than a clever girl who's a crazy about a writer. No one can ever be a match for him. He must have saved a country in his past life. -Please say something. -Look at the camera. Is it a celebrity? It's Han Se-ju. -No pictures! -Please say something. WHERE ARE YOU? Where are you? Please come to Area G. I'm scared. Is she a kid? Why would she be scared in an airport? Does she have a phobia? Gosh, what a shame I have to work instead of going after Han Se-ju. Excuse me. Are you Hanna Kim? Why are you so late? I'm sorry. But actually, I'm 48 seconds early. Cut the nonsense. This is it. Tell him it's a gift from the cafe owner in Chicago. Make sure you deliver it in person. Thanks in advance. Wait, what's the name of the sender? Let's see. "To Han Se-ju"? TO HAN SE-JU No way. That Han Se-ju? Gosh, I should really be going with you and taking care of you. What can I do though? I have things to take care of here. I told you. The Han Se-ju 100 billion-dollar project. You mean the Gal Ji-seok 100 billion-dollar project. Gosh, can you take a break? Being a workaholic is a disease. Who do you think made me a workaholic? I'm not sure. I have a ton of writing that I have to finish. How can I take a break? It looks like I need a diaper and to keep writing nonstop. Stop giving me work if you have any conscience. You must be hungry. Ms. Kang. You made a reservation at the restaurant, right? Fire! One steak, two pasta dishes, and one special for table seven! Hurry up. Faster! Does he cook with his mouth or what? Listen up. Let's publish your serial novel through an app and make it a hit-- Beautiful. Beautiful. Gosh, seriously. Why is he so loud? Anyway, we'll revise the story line a little bit afterward and turn it into a movie, game, musical, webtoon, and so on. A one-source multi-use business that effectively utilizes your content-- Ms. Kang, I'd like to take today off even if my schedule is full. I knew you'd say that, so I left your schedule empty. The starting point is your idea-- The staff are still on vacation. Will you be going to a hotel? No, I'd like to go home. The staff don't need to come back early from their vacation for me. You should leave early today too. So the earlier you come up with an idea, the faster we can prepare-- There was that stalker incident recently. Will you be okay alone? I'll be fine. Don't just say you'll get some rest. Please make sure you do today. Why don't you give your mouth some rest first? Am I talking to myself or what? I'm the CEO of Golden Bear Publishing! Excuse me. Mr. Han, did you enjoy the food? Yes, it was delicious. -Could I possibly get your autograph? -Well-- A friend of mine is an avid fan of Mr. Han. -Sure, give it to me. -Thank you. -What's the name? -Jeon Seol. It means legend. TO JEON SEOL -It's a very unique name. -It'd be amazing if I could get another one to hang up in my restaurant. -What's your restaurant called? -It's Riccardo. TO RICA It's cca. There are two Cs. Please do it again. How fussy. Good. TO RICCARDO Thank you. Thank you very much. That's right. Please open this fortune cookie for a bit of fun. It's pretty accurate. I'll open it later. My gosh. Is this a castle or what? So I'm actually... in front of the writer Han Se-ju's house right now. My heart is beating so fast. A fortune cookie. "The muses are ghosts, and sometimes they come uninvited." By Stephen King. A package. There's a package for you. A package for you! Was that weird? A package has arrived! A package for you. -Who is it? -There's a package for you! I'm sorry, but could you please just leave it at the door? My client told me to make sure that I give it to you in person. I'm working at the moment. Please leave it there. Wait, Mr. Han. Just a second, Mr. Han! Mr. Han. I must've been the biggest traitor to my country in my past life. I can't believe I blew this amazing chance because of a squeaky voice. Who are you? Do you live in this house? You are adorable. I'm jealous that you live in this house. I wanted to go in there too. I wanted to see his writing room too. Are you telling me to follow you? I have a package for you, Mr. Han. Please open the door. You have a package. You have a package. How did you get in here? Sorry? Well... You opened the door. Did you say I opened the door? Me? Who are you? Are you a stalker? I should've introduced myself. I'm sorry. I'm... Wait. I'm a black belt. I'm a 17th degree martial arts expert. Whatever you are trying to take out, you'd better think carefully. You will take full responsibility for your hasty decision. I won't go easy even if you are a girl. I thought about it carefully just now. I'm from Do Anything, the errand service agency where-- The chosen one, Fairy Wang Bang-ul? I'm sorry. That was a mistake. That's my friend's mom's fortune-teller business card. I'm from the errand service agency, Do Anything. DO ANYTHING I will check your identity later. Now, I will put your package inside your house. Stop. If you will put it in front of the door, I'll check it later. Since I'm here... It's okay. -But I will-- -I said no! My goodness, you are hot-tempered. No. I don't take packages into the house before they've been checked. Why is that? In this world, there are many people who get blinded by jealousy and end up wasting their lives. Those people include... stalkers, or people who suffer from a persecution complex and insist that I stole their scripts. -I'm not a stalker. I'm a big fan-- -Blackmail letters are only the beginning. From photographs with my eyes carved out to razor blades, animal corpses, and handmade explosives, I get all sorts of things delivered. Really? Someone once sneaked into my house and installed a hidden camera. Someone tried to steal my manuscript. Someone even got caught while secretly lying in my bed. Therefore, I don't bring anything in carelessly, whether it's a person, a thing, or whatever it might be. Didn't something just go past us? Your dog. Dog? My dog? I'm allergic to dog hair, I don't own a dog. Get it! Get it right now! What? Then I have to go inside your house. Go in! Go inside and get it! Okay. I'll go. It's not my dog, but I will go and get it. No! Not that one! -Here's a good boy. -What? What is it? Come here. No. No. Not that one. Is that a USB flash drive? Does that look like any old USB flash drive? That's my hard work. It's the valuable material I collected while sacrificing my sleep and meals. The piece that I worked on until my back broke, until calluses formed on my butt, until my eyes became ulcerated. That's what it means to me. If that dog eats that, you will die too. But it's not my dog. But it followed you in when you sneaked in here! I'm telling you, the door just opened. Don't you dare eat that! I'll pluck out all your fur. Don't provoke him. He's getting agitated. Good boy. Come here. I'll give you a delicious snack. Come here. Are you crazy? He reacted to snack. No. No, please don't eat that. -That's not food. Please. -Oh, dear. No. Good boy. Don't eat that. You'll get a stomachache. Don't eat it. Good boy. You darn dog! Don't you dare eat that! I'll cut you open if you eat that! What are you doing? Go and get him! Why should I? I just entered your house. You said anything is possible! I'll pay you double. Quadruple. Double that! I'll catch him. You go home. You'll only provoke him more. You won't be of any help. Do you think I'm crazy? What if you're out to get my material? You have so many doubts. I used to be a vet. I wouldn't get a dog involved in some scam. That makes you even more suspicious! You probably trained the dog. You probably locked him in a cage, fed him only dumplings, and raised him as an attack dog. "Bite the enemy's neck." You could have done that for all I know! You have such a great imagination. No wonder you're a writer. I'll do it. Don't provoke him. -That darn-- -Stop it. Did you just cover my mouth? We need to be careful. We have to treat him carefully with love and patience. Copy me. Good boy. Come here. He's not good at all. Good boy. Come here. Good boy. Come here. Good boy. -Good boy. Come here. -Good boy. What a good boy! -Come here. -Come here. Help! Hey, Seol. It's been a while. It's an emergency. -What's wrong? -He swallowed something valuable. He swallowed a USB flash drive. We need it out right away. Otherwise, a dog and a person will die. -Come this way. -This way. Luckily, he didn't need an operation because he pooped before we even took the X-ray. Pooped? He got it all out without an enema. It was painless. Got it all out? The memory stick seems to be working fine. This can only be called a miracle. It was locked, so I couldn't see what was on it. Don't worry. -Get it away. -I cleaned it thoroughly. Look. I have another request. Is it done? As you said, I e-mailed you everything that was on the USB flash drive. Right now, I'm formatting the USB flash drive and the laptop. The laptop is new. It won't take long. Have some coffee. Thank you. I appreciate it. Do you have something you want to say to me? Don't you remember me? We've met once before. Why are you laughing? Because that was so predictable. "Don't you remember me? We've met before." -It's true. -It's true. It's so boring. It's like a chorus of a song. So? When did we meet? -It was-- -About 100 years ago? Or 1,000 years ago? When I ask them why they're obsessed with me, they usually say this. "Don't try to make sense of it. All I can say is that it's destiny. It might have something to do with our past lives." What do you say? Is that what you were going to say? Or has it given you new ideas? I'm not obsessed with you. I'm just your first-ever fan-- In the movie, Misery, the woman says, "I am your number one fan." I think the laptop is formatted. Please throw away this memory stick on your way out. I can give you my laptop as a gift. Wait. I mean... Thank you for your work. I'll make sure to pay you generously. Can I at least finish my coffee? -Do you want me to open this for you? -No. It's fine. Careful! I already have someone who goes through my packages for me. I have no other intentions. The sender said it's important that this package is delivered personally. -So in order to fulfill my duty-- -Do you know the sender? I guess I forgot to mention it. I can explain inside... It's okay. Tell me right here who sent this to me. -Chicago. -Chicago? She said you'd know if I told you it's a gift from a cafe owner in Chicago. No. I am a huge fan, but to me, she's priceless. I'll open this myself inside. -Goodbye. -Wait. Look. Wait. Mr. Han. -Why does she like him so much? -Mr. Han. She's always been a bookworm. She said that books help her through her hardships. She's had many hardships in her life. What I don't get is, from Baek Tae-min to Kim Young-ha, Cheon Myeong-kwan, and Kim Yeon-su, there are countless other writers. Why Han Se-ju, of all writers? "Don't try to make sense of it. All I can say is that it's destiny." That's what he said. He said that it might have something to do with our past lives. But he didn't recognize me. Hey, young lady. Stop speaking Italian. You sound so cheesy. Young lady, I have something amazing for you. TO JEON SEOL It's Han Se-ju's autograph. "It's Han Se-ju's autograph?" Open it and take a look. You're not saying this is Han Se-ju's, are you? I went to deliver a package for him, and he gave it to me. I helped him with something. Unbelievable. Let me get some energy from a best-seller writer. Will it help me win the writing competition? See? This is what you call a successful enthusiastic fan. -Let me see. -I want to see it too. SEONGSUCHEONG -That was hilarious. -That was so funny. Wait. Lower your voice. That was so funny. Gosh. Seol. Stand right there. I know. It's late and I'm drunk. I won't do it again. Just worry about your daughter, Bang-jin. You don't have to care of someone like me. You. Did you deliver something weird today? Something weird? Like what? Ashes, for example. No. Why do you ask? What could it be then? I sense a dark energy around you. Wait. You're not seeing strange things again, are you? Gosh, there you go again. Do you see them or not? Don't worry. I don't. That was so long ago. That's a relief. I'll kill myself if I start seeing them again. They're the reason my mom abandoned me and I gave up on the Olympics. Will you stop? How many times do I have to tell you that your mom ran away with a guy? Oh, my. That really cheers me up. Is this what you thought I'd say? -I mean-- -I know. Just go to bed. Ms. Wang, your shoes are getting worn out. I should get going. How strange. I feel something strange. What on earth did she deliver? IN FRUSTRATION, HE... Hey. Don't you think she'd be useful if we trained her? She's a fast learner. I'm done. It took 20 seconds. Did you see that? Well done. You shouldn't teach such things to a kid. What? What are you trying to say? Do you know this gun's nickname? I don't know. What is it? They say that the sound of its gunshot is similar to a typewriter, so it got the nickname Chicago Typewriter. That's cool. So? A pen is stronger than a knife. A typewriter is stronger than a gun. So? You should write something good. Don't write to gain fame and women. Write something magnificent. Stop nagging me. It's too early in the morning for this. What do you mean, morning? It's already past 3 p.m. It's not like you to oversleep. Have you let go of yourself because all your staff have gone on vacation? Come on. I always deliver the golden eggs on time. Have I ever missed a deadline? Just bleed me dry, why don't you? Gosh, listen to this guy. I was just joking. Did I sound so serious to you? I just wanted to tell you that we might have to tell the investors about your idea by tomorrow. In the 1930s. In Gyeongseong. PRESIDENT GAL JI-SEOK So you have an idea. Gyeongseong in the 1930s? Is it a period piece? It's a love story of an independence fighter and a writer. Korea's Stephen King, Han Se-ju writes a love story. That in itself will be a selling point. Are you happy now? Bye then. Maybe I worked too long. Just bleed me dry... Hi, Ms. Kang. Excuse me? A dog? What dog? Yes. Really? All right. Bye. Hi. -Here's the paper you asked for. -Seol. What do we do with the dog? What about the dog? Is he sick? I just talked to Han Se-ju's secretary, but he said he can't take him. He isn't his dog? No, he isn't. How strange. This dog was running around as if he owned the place. He even opened the door for him. He seems like an abandoned dog. But he's fully grown, so he won't be adopted. Seol, you can't take him, can you? I'd love to, but I'm living at my friend's place. I guess you aren't so different from him. I'll go and ask the writer tonight after I finish work. There won't be any point. Apparently, he's allergic to dogs. It seemed like he had a large garden and a large staff. Maybe someone else can take care of the dog. Maybe we were meant to meet each other. US SUBMACHINE GUNS THOMPSON SUBMACHINE GUN M1928 FATE Mr. Han? It is you, Se-ju. Are you busy? How about a cup of tea? Why would I? -It's Han Se-ju. -He's so handsome! My gosh. Why would I mind? My father recently finished the novel he's been writing for ten years. It's going to be published as a series soon. He said he'll never do it again. He even gave himself a hernia. My mother is still into painting. Right. You know Se-ra went to France to study, don't you? Why are you telling me all this? Excuse me? I'm sure it isn't because that's all you can brag about in front of a lonely orphan. Se-ju. You used to live with us under the same roof. It's been a long time since I moved out from under that roof. Why do I need to know what's going on there? It's as bad as telling me to read a boring novel to the end. Even if I was forced to buy the book, I still have the right to stop reading it. I stopped reading it a long time ago. Don't open it again. It's boring. Did you feel like you were forced? I once thought it was a gift. All of my family feels sorry that we couldn't be nice to you until the end. -But-- -Does it make you feel better if you talk like that? Stop being so negative. I just wanted to catch up personally with-- Why would I want to see you personally? Mr. Han. In public, I'm wearing a so-called business mask. It's the smile of capitalism. If I make an effort as a professional, it's doable. That's not the case in personal situations. So let's not do this. My father is very worried about you. It seems to bother him that you write dangerous things. Dangerous things? He's old-fashioned. Because of the books you write, he thinks you're at risk of potential crimes-- Dangerous things... were already written ten years ago. It ruined... both your life and mine. Could there be anything more dangerous than that? Stop wasting your valuable time. Go and write. Write madly like me. Write madly... like me. UNFAIR GAME CHALLENGES AMAZON "THE MUSES ARE GHOSTS, AND SOMETIMES THEY COME UNINVITED." BY STEPHEN KING Who's there? You can't walk into my writing room without permission-- Hello, Mr. Han. How did you get in here again? Sorry? After ringing the bell, I realized the door was already open. I made sure to close it on my way in. You'd better lock up. Well... I already heard everything from the veterinarian, but I feel really bad for the dog. So I wanted to ask you one last time. I suggest that you be more creative. Pardon me? You're using the same trick. I've never let you in here myself, but the door is open or miraculously opens whenever you come. -I'm telling the truth. -Why would you bring a dog here just to lie to me? You always blame the dog. Though I guess that using a dog is indeed a good way to let the other person's guard down when committing a crime. What do you mean, a crime? Who are you? Mr. Han. Were you the one who was in my writing room? Were you the peeping person? No, I'm not. Why would I do that? I'm just... Did a stalker break in? Don't ask me. You should know. Are you... accusing me? I told you. I'm your first-ever fan-- I know people like you very well. After claiming that you're a huge fan, that you like me, and that you admire me, you idealize me in your own illusion and become obsessed with me. Once the illusion is shattered, you turn your back on me and attack and blackmail me. Get lost. Otherwise, I'll call the police. I don't need a fan like you. Let's go. I don't think he's going to accept you as a family member. I can't force him to take you if he doesn't want to. Let's go. Your sandwich and coffee are ready. Enjoy. He's here again. He comes every day at the same time. Then he orders the cheapest sandwich and a cup of coffee and stays here the whole day. It's already been a month. He sometimes eats the leftover sandwiches or cookies that other people leave behind. Maybe he's homeless. He looks like an ordinary person though. It seemed like he was writing a novel. Of course, he doesn't remember. It was so long ago. Where are you going? It's dangerous! Oh, gosh. You should write something good. Don't write to gain fame and women. Write something magnificent. Who's there? Are you still here? I told you I'll call the police. Mr. Han. Don't you remember me? For three years now, I've been sending you emails and letters every day. Please... put that gun down so that we can talk. I was disappointed. You never replied. You sent me a message through your serial novel that I should take revenge against the world. Put your gun down first. I knew right away that you were speaking to me. I thought, "This is my story. Mr. Han is sending me a message through his novel." So I've eliminated everyone like you told me to. What? Eliminated? Who? The jerks making my life difficult. Are you saying... that you killed people after reading my novel? That's what you told me to do. Are you insane? Why did you end the story like that? Why do I have to die? I just wiped out those pieces of trash like you said. That novel isn't about you! Don't lie to my face. I told you that story! All I did was do as you say. Why do I have to die? Why? You ruined me. Your novel destroyed my life! Don't be ridiculous. No idiot would let a novel ruin his life. You're the one who ruined your life. You said she used to dream of becoming an Olympian. For which event? Didn't I tell you? -Shooting. -"Shooting"? Why did she quit? An injury? No. She has hallucinations every time she holds a gun. What does she see? Her past life. She sees herself shooting someone dead in her past life. Before she started having hallucinations, she really was known as a legend. A legendary sniper. -When did you learn how to shoot? -A very long time ago. I'll tell you about it when we become close. It reminds me of Misery. It's creepy! Reporter Son just dropped a bomb. I told you we must make sure she doesn't talk! Do think you're so perfect? You'll hit a dead end one day too! I told you I'd write it! That ghost writer I told you about... What is this? Have I gone crazy? Am I going insane? I can't die like this. Subtitle translation by Leon Elalouf
