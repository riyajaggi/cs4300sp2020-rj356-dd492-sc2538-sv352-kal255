 There you go. Did you have a girlfriend in Sudan? -No. Do you have a boyfriend? -Not really. Can you pass me my shoes. Are you jealous? -No. You are lying. You are jealous. How can you know that? -I hear it from your voice. What is it? I can see you. There is such a creature in the stairwell. - Go get the rest. They found us. We have to get out of here.

 Wait here. Man that was intense, nerve-racking and bizarre. How did you do that? I don't know. The compass is not pointing to the north. There is a magnetic field here. It must be the spaceship. It works as a magnetic monopole. What is that? -A field with one magnetic pole. That is why the compass does not work. In theory they can exist, but none has ever been found. My mother says that we are going to England. It looks that way. You think you can protect us? At least I can try.

 Noah thought that he  could protect us too. What happened to him? He was shot. He was bleeding,  there was so much blood. I tried to stop it, but it did not help. Take what you want. We go. If the signal came from here ... it must have crashed once we had the location. Do you think there is a connection? -No idea. Do you disapprove? They have to die, but we don't  have to enjoy it. It is their earned wage. And if the roles were reversed? If we had found them first, had we done the same? I hope not. We leave. What happened? -No idea. I don't see any colors. Everything is black and white. It's like everything is formed before my eyes. It only happens when you hear the sound? It happened in the hospital too. Do you hear the sound now? They know where we are. We are going to the university where Bill works. And dad? We have to go home. Yes, but for the time being we stay with the others. What is that? -The time when the attack started. There are other survivors. What now? Everyone's dead. There is a back-up generator. Are there any other entries? There is a back door and there are emergency exits in the stairwell. This way. Pretty Gruesome, is it? That is completely Darwinism. The law of the strongest. Is that why they kill us? -No, there's probably more to it. Maybe they are just evil and get off on it. They want to stay alive. They are afraid of dying. Why do you say that? I feel it. muscular dystrophy What are you thinking? About what? About what happened. That thing. No idea. - You had sex with a freak. You are not a freak. -Then what? You are beautiful. Shut up. -I mean it. I thought you were pretty when you pissed on me in that store. Are you joking now? -I just want to cheer you up. What happened to your family? Government soldiers arrived to our village. They killed them. -Why? They are Dinka we are Nuer. We have always  fought each other. I can not imagine what that does to a person. I joined the White Army. The militia. I wanted to avenge my family. Did you kill people? Maybe you will  think I'm a freak... Or worse. If my family was killed, I would like revenge too. Then you have already lost everything and you also lose yourself. Whatever is happening to you it has saved our lives. Let us be grateful for that. You haven't lost your way. Is that what's making Emily see again? She thinks so. It is a kind of sensor. Maybe a processor too. - Isn't she blind anymore? There is such a thing as blind sight. It means that a blind person knows where there is something without seeing it. They pick up a cup without thinking. Because they remember where it is? -Not always. We too fill in the gaps on top of what we see. That is our consciousness. A blind person has less information ... Because their eyes are fucked. I wouldn't put it like that, but they have an enhanced consciousness. Something is on it. -What is it? It looks like a binary code. What about it? with your sweetheart and those creatures? It doesn't seem normal to me. -We don't know what it is. Is right. Maybe that's the problem. - She saved us. Is that right? Are you sure? I'm just saying. - Maybe you talk too much. I hear that often. People are still walking around. Sorry about Noah. How's Sacha? Is he ok? What do you mean? Well, they seemed close to me. Were they close? Why do you ask that? I just wonder. Did he say anything? What are you talking about? - About nothing. Do you want something to eat? -Yes, I like some cheese. We will be back tomorrow in the observatory. Keep your boots on, just in case we have to flee. Thanks. I used to have nothing but a boring life. I drank too much wine, didn't exercise enough ... Those were my biggest concerns. I wanted to leave the army. -How so? I had seen too much. What people do to each other ... You will find it normal. You have to. What did you do in addition to your work? -I worked a lot. And besides I cared about Sophia. She was addicted. To what? -Pills, drink, anything. I tried to help her, but to no avail. And after that... I collapsed. I couldn't take it anymore. I put her out on the street. If I hadn't done that, if we had kept in touch ... she put the phone on record when I called. Then she was on time been to the observatory. She needed me. I abandoned her. Sounds like you've done what you could. Try to rest a bit. I could not sleep. -You ok? Do you think there's a reason that we survived? I think we were lucky. Maybe there is more to it. Such as? I don't know. What are you doing? - Nice stuff. Don't do that. They don't need it They are dead. What do you think about it? - Put it back. You don't tell me what to do. I'm sure your mom doesn't want you to steal. - Those people are dead anyway. What were you and mom talking about? Did you talk about me? -Yes, your mother was upset. She was talking about Noah. - Do you think she cared about him? He knew nothing. What are you doing here anyway? We are not family. -It's just the way things have worked out. That is just the situation. Maybe it will change. Try to get some sleep. Nobody wants to see that. Is there water? Shall I get you some? -I have to pee. Nobody wants to hear that. Why is this happening to her? I think because of the gene mutation which made her sick. I have that gene too. I am not bothered by anything. And your husband? -Only I am a carrier. Jonathan is not her biological father. He loves her just as much. He only looks at me differently. Sorry. Emily doesn't know. Of course. Do you still have space in your bag? Eat something. We're leaving soon. Did you sleep well? You look very fit. Come eat something. Is that your daughter? -Yes. Can I have him back? Give him the photo. Is everything alright? I'm going to relieve Ash. Come on with that sermon. I'm worried about you. -We're being careful. I'm not worried about you getting pregnant. Well, I'm not used to that. I can see again. Do you know how great that is? -We don't know why. So what? - What did you do with that creature? Just be happy. I'm scared to death. I'm trying to keep us alive. Really. What did you do, Mom? Well? -I'm trying my best. Hats off. Good job. Like some company? Sometimes I think: It's better to give up. We're dying anyway. You don't mean that. -Don't I? After Dan'a death I found some sleeping pills. I wanted to use them. Why did you change your mind? I couldn't do it to Bill. Your children are still alive. You are together. Maybe that's as good as it gets. Tom's birthday today. He turned fifteen. I don't think he even realizes it. We always celebrated it big. Emily always claimed our attention, so that day really revolved around him. Come on, we'll have a party. I mean it. We are still alive.  Fuck em...You know. There are shops nearby. Maybe we could all use a party. Next one. Next one. Hold still. Good Lord. What is it? -It's a map of our DNA. They're scanning our DNA. It all seemed so important. Now nobody cares anymore. Have you seen Helen? -A while ago. She's with my mother. Help! Help me!! This way. Come on. It'll be fine. Push. Push!! Helen, where have you been? What happened? -We wanted to celebrate Tom's birthday. I was worried to death. - I'm unharmed. Happy Birthday. Make a wish. You get this from me. -Thank you. I love you. - I love you too. There you go. How did you ... - This is from Bill and me. Thanks. -Happy birthday, Tom. Here, I have something for you too. -It's not my birthday. Sorry. -It's ok. Those shoes are really cool. - Yes, the cake too. Not nice  (I don't think that what's said). I want you to teach me to shoot. How far are you? I think they know much more about us then we about them. I think they're scanning our DNA. Why? Ash said they took babies from the hospital. There may be a connection. What is it? -The woman who was dragged ... was pregnant. What the interest in babies? -No idea. You figure it out. I have to keep watch. Shall I keep you company? -Yes please. Where are the waiting posts? Hands up. Where are my men? Where are my soldiers? -There was nobody here. Who are you? That is my sister.
