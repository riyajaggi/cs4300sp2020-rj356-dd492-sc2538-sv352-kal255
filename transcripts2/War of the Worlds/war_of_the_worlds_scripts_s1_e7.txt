 Thomas and Emma are going things  get. They have not returned. We can not stay here. Before the attack, my sister said that  soldiers were in the observatory. I can get help. Is there anyone? Hands up. Where are my men? Where are the soldiers?  -There was no one here. Who are you?  -That is my sister. They're in a basement. The seriously injured can not go anywhere.  The food and water are running low. These beings walk around the resort. The army can help them.  -There is no army. These are just a few soldiers. There are probably more.  Which still have bunkers and stuff? We have no  reach. To our knowledge, there are  no government and no army anymore. They have given us  almost all killed. Want to talk to the Colonel?  -I can try it. They saved us. I promised them  that I would get help. Day, sleepyhead. Everthing allright? Look, this is my sister, Catherine.  I told you about her. I'm thirsty. You were hard to snoring.  -Nietes. Welles. Sophia farts in her sleep. Yes, I remember.  -Small vice. Their belongings are gone.  Their ration ditto. Where would they have gone?  -To their families likely. Your sister is still alive. How nice for you. What is it? She talked about a ski resort. There are survivors there.  They can not go anywhere. The food and get water. Then we must help them. Easier said than done.  -What else we need? Your sister should point us be the way. But my men have to  rest for a day. Thanks. The fighting closer.  We have to go. Where to?  -You still have seen a soldier? Expect protection? It's  war. No one looks at us. Maybe.  -My equipment is here. That no one cares, Bill.  -Well, that's stupid. We have more  to learn about these creatures. We need to stay alive. Your family is not safe here.  -Where is it? How close are the fights? We still have some time.  -Let's wait and see. If necessary, we leave. Have you seen Theo?  -No. What can you bad lie. I saw you.  -You found me. He asks if you want to join.  -I have to work. Go your book already hold.  I'll be right there, okay? In? I can not identify the signal. Science is never really  your thing been. It's strange  to see you with a child. I just do something. You're doing great. Better than me.  I had the patience. That's true. I was therefore really a troublemaker. That is also true. They should remain in Africa. Who knows where they're going. How are you? Are you clean? The end of time  was a good reason to kick off. The need is always there.  Constantly. Every day, but ... I must be strong for Theo. I have to stay clean. Nice to hear.  I'm really happy for you. Yes. Now we just have to  see to stay alive. Plays something  between you and the Colonel? Come on. I've seen it.  I see the way you look at him. I would want to. If you again  want to have sex, you should go for it. I have read a book  about a talking dog. Everthing allright? We have decent food  you get. You never talk about your husband. Sorry to bring it up.  -He is... He's probably dead. We do not talk about.  It is as if we lie to each other. I miss his presence. As we had no great marriage.  -That does not make it easier. It goes well with you and Bill. I know, I'm crazy.  No, it is touching. How's Emily? She is thrilled that she can see again.  How can that it does not matter. Maybe Bill finds out.  He always wants to know everything. He has quite  a high opinion of himself. Stop. Hood still agree with that. Your father never yelled at you?  Maybe that's the problem. Sorry. I take that back. Erik clumsy I am.  -My father is dead, huh? We do not know that.  We still live. He also fixed. You always say  that you need proof look. Prove this than once.  -That's not. But I'm sure your father  will do everything to come here. He comes to you  because he loves you. Not exactly scientific.  -The science jerk. Some things you can not explain.  Who are just as they are. You still love Helen, huh? I'll give you some advice. Do not mean  to the people you love. Science is jerk? I exaggerated a bit. Sometimes you do  nothing about it. In certain cases. Do you want... we will be a game of football? If you feel like it.  -Not really. It was just a suggestion.  You may want to join Ash. Why did they murder any animals,  but only humans? Maybe those are not a threat.  -Or are vegans ... and they disapprove  deal with how other species. Do not be crazy.  -Do you have a better explanation? Have you lost something?  -The picture of my family. When you last had him?  -In the castle. He was in my backpack. Damn. Maybe he's fallen out. I get so many belongings. You got him, huh?  -What? You were looking at it this morning and  hid something for me. I hid nothing.  -Give here that photo. I did not see him.  Why would he have that picture? He caught him. Sure. What nonsense.  Look in my pockets. This is ridiculous.  I'm not that stupid picture. Take it easy.  -Find you this good? Why would he have your photo?  -He steals. He does it for them. He's a thief. Watch.  How do you think he does this? You're crazy.  -How did you get that? Put on your party for him?  -No. How do you get it? Say it. From the castle.  -Did you steal? Yes. You stole food there.  That's not the same. That is different.  -That people are dead anyway. I have this picture  of his family not stupid. Tell her  what really happened with Noah. How do you mean?  -Go. I saw it myself. Sacha has  left him to his fate. He's lying. Really, Mom.  -He begged you to open the door. His death is your fault.  -What nonsense. I want my picture. That's the  only thing I have left of them. Give up. I did not see him.  -Enough. He knows what he has done. He's lost it.  Why he starts talking about Noah? No idea. Did something happen? No not at all. Do not you believe me? No idea. You think I killed him? No. I think that a DNA scanner.  They study us. Therefore they take babies with?  Yes, and fetuses. Why?  -No idea. This creature ... This is not, huh? There is something else.  -I think so. What are beings?  -No idea. What do they want? What are they doing?  -I do not know. You said they want in life  remain. What do you mean? Everything would still survive?  -Your knowledge can help me. To kill them?  -They want to exterminate us. There are billions of people dead.  My son also. You think we better? Ask Kareem but to his family.  We also murders. You let them live. Why?  -I do not know. You said you feel what they feel.  What did you mean? No idea.  I'm not here to ask. What is it? Calm down. When they wanted to bark  like dogs do that so often ... happened something miraculous. Hello, she said.  Bubba did not look particularly out ... but it was great  to listen to her. Bubba the Bulldog was in fact talking. And she had another  broad vocabulary. Want one?  -No, I have to keep watch. Drink mine it.  -I will do. Then I forget a little  that I so damn me ... feel ignorant. Incredibly,  the attack was only eight days ago. Still thank  you for saving my life. You're welcome. I had  a choice and I chose you. What do you mean, you chose me? I had to save you. You said you had to choose. I had to decide where I was going  to go when the attack was imminent. What now? Chris've seen yet, huh?  -No. We have already discussed.  -You are lying. You met him.  -Not true. Tell me the truth.  Otherwise you lost me. Say it. I wanted to warn him.  He did not listen. I just had to save you. He stopped me.  -What have you done? He grabbed me. I was in a hurry,  so I pushed him off me. Then he fell. Have you left him to his fate?  -I had to save you. Why he would lie under in the hallway? I moved him. Otherwise I had to explain.  You give me all -Lieg all the time? I did it for you.  No, for yourself. What I want to let you cold. You think  always just yourself. You do not understand. I love you.  Come on, Helen. Val broken. Maybe they resemble birds. Their spaceship crashed  when we ran the plates. Perhaps that is the cause. Where they look like birds? Birds use the  quantum properties of their cells. They can in perfect formation  flying. They navigate. Those beings perhaps. What does that have  to do with the dishes? Radio waves can function  have disrupted their cells. Maybe they're against the mountain  flown because they did not see him. They were suddenly blind. I think  that's why they crashed. The ship is of organic material. The ship. The creatures. Whatever  was in that charred capsule. Maybe they are connected  with the ship. So they functioned not  as the ship went down? No. Suppose their cells connected  on the quantum level ... they can feel each other. At all times. Even when they  are apart. The low frequency we  picked up ... that connects them. So it was no communication?  -Daardoor see them. If we disturb the frequency,  see and they can no more. Are you sure? It is a hypothesis.  I must first test. Would you looking for them? It could be a major breakthrough. You do not believe me. I believe you. Why do we go to England? Perhaps there is better than here. Or worse. Maybe it's terrible there.  -I do not wanna hear it. We do not need him.  We have each other. Is that not enough? You always want more. Slain by a fox, I think. You took the picture, huh? Why?  Do you think everything is predestined? You met my mother,  for example. I just want him back. Only if you tell Mom  that you lied about Noah. Do you think they believe?  -Overtuig her but. Otherwise I put the picture on fire.  -Do not you dare. Shoot your me down? No, I thought not. we have a deal? You did Noah die.  Maybe it was justified. How long do you think the truth  even to conceal? She loves me.  -She finds out. She will say  that she still loves you ... but everything will change.  -You tell us something. You'll see it in her eyes.  -Shut up. You'll see  that she does not love you. Shut up. Out of the way. Where's Emily?  -She was suddenly gone. Stay with Ash. Do not. It's all right, Helen. What happened? Translation: BTI Studios
