 If I can move my fingers ... Last night you took the stairs or the elevator? Stairs. You must have seen Chris. Why ? He went to check the meter after the cut. You would have crossed. I have not seen it. Open up, damn! It's over ? What do you see ?

 There are dead bodies in the street. There is Chris? I do not think so. That risk anything? Get me out of there. Sorry. It was what ? Nothing. A man. Mum... you think dad died? He's fine, I'm sure. When do we go back? When we get out of danger. Where you were before? I was looking for a rope.

 - I did not find one. - Let me out. He probably wanted to help. Honey... Honey... It is out of danger? I think, otherwise we would see people down. Stay behind me. You're sure that it will not start? Do not look. - Whore... - What? What's the matter ? Come on! Everyone is dead, right? Tom, come! Tom, get in the car. What are we going to do ? We told Dad we came in, we go. And so it begins again? What do we do ? Let's walk. Take your bags. Not French. English? You are fine ? You've seen people? Alive? No and you ? Not a lot. There was what? It's like that everywhere? I know. Over the phone, Internet, radio ... It's total crap. - You need anything? - No. Thank you. You know where to go? You can stay with us. I have to find my family. They are in France? In London. I'll go through the tunnel. It is perhaps less serious there. Take care. You want to bury him? The buried where? In the park. You think Dan died? You know nothing. He was in the bunker ... It will definitely good. Helen? What are you doing ? I have to find Dan. - I am coming with you. - I do not want. He's my son too. You think I do not love? Helen, I beg you! What are you doing here ? You'll need something to eat. Your shoes, it will not work. They are new. Chris wanted jogging, he never found the time. I do not want to hear you whine because of blisters. I'm waiting downstairs. Let's go. The dog. - The pulse did not kill the dog. - So what ? It's interesting. Sorry. Why are you doing this ? So the dog can get out if hungry. What are you doing ? Sorry, I just wanted to eat ... This is a gun? It looks like they set us. Do not look at them. What do we do now ? We could go see the police... army someone who will tell us what to do. Perhaps, they all died. I'm hungry. We'll find room. What's the matter ? - Do not you hear? - What? Yet this sound. I hear nothing, come. There is someone ? - We must still pay? - I think we can use. Do not take anything. What healthy things. Mum ? What's the matter ? Are two dead. They had to pull over. We use and we're leaving. Help me. Please... Help me... What is happening ? I need a doctor. Mum ? People they could help. Tom, wait. Emily, come. Are injured, help! Tom, wait! They not stop. They take care of themselves, we should too. You want to give up. I do not want to abandon it. He will die. Even if there were a doctor, you really believe... at least try. I care about him. You and Emily, that's all that matters to me. Why are you like this? It's okay ? You want something ? Some water. Tell me where they are. In front of you... Lower. You are too far. Thank you. What happened ? I wanted food and water... He stabbed me, I wanted to kill him ... It's nothing. We will find help. It's serious ? I bled a lot. It will be fine. My mother will find help. All those deaths ... What happened ? There was an attack. It's like that everywhere? I do not know. I think yes. I can talk to you ? What's the matter ? Let's go outside. Why ? She wants to leave me. What? We did not give up. Please do not leave me. We can not help you, sorry. - Emily, we're leaving. - We need to find a doctor. There are no doctors. You do not know! - You're welcome ! - We can not do anything. You're welcome ! No ! All that I want, it's a doctor. You're welcome. I'll find a doctor, release. Go ahead, it remains! Please... I promise you, I'll get help. Please, leave. - What's the matter ? - Classes ! What are you doing ? Nothing, I ... I'm wondering. How they know as much on us ? Looks like they know more that ourselves. The question, that's why they give us that. If I find out how, I understand probably why. There must be a link between means and intentions. It's not a scientific experiment. Let's move on. It's over there. - You're lost, right? - Not at all. But I'm not sure to know where we are. It's the same. I hear the sound again. You're making films. Go. It will not happen at home before the night. We will stay in this hotel. Its good. We all slept in this bed? - Are larger rooms. - It's okay. This is serious at this point? Crisps and chocolate? We made an exception today. The guy at the store ... you think he died? Surely. One can avoid the subject? Eat a little, sweetheart. I'm not hungry. You saw when Dan? Shortly before the attack. How he was going? Not too bad. Jack had to drop him the rest of its business. He told you why they separated? Jack had an affair. I never liked that Jack is a con. Dan deserves better. We find it, Helen. I'm sure. There is someone ? I found it in the cellar. We should go for Chris. One would be dead, too. It was a good person. Did you see it ? I already told you. I never would have let him die. Excuse me. I must get some sleep. Adaptation: Emmanuel Menouna Subtitling TITRAFILM
