 Minister? -Do you have anything? We have nothing yet heard from Northwood and Whitehall. Someone has to take a look. Do I have to ask for volunteers? - An order is better. What did I say? Don't run through the corridors. The walls are coming towards them. What did you say to them? -Nothing yet. What should I say? That their family and friends probably be dead. Sorry. I did not mean it like that. How are you doing?

 It is so unreal. Maybe it's not too bad. Helen? What is it? I thought you left. -I was in the shed. Why should I leave? Come on, it's a long way. Mom, what's up? -Nothing. Pack your bags. We go. Why are we going out here? -Therefore. Come. Have you been able to sleep? -A little. And you? -Not really. You will not notice it here. Do you have any family besides your sister?

 Our parents have been killed when she was twelve. What to. -It has been a long time ago. Did you raise her? Not easy. - Especially for her. She never processed it. Can I have a moment? Is it the same everywhere? There are probably remote places where they have not landed. Maybe they don't know anything about it and life just goes on. I hope so. What is that? Where is it from? - It's the same frequency again. Is that music? - Really strange. Still from the northwest? -Yes. I try to clean up the signal. What is it? That number. We have sent that into space. I chose it. That's how they found us. It is our fault. What are we going to do at home? - Find out what's going on. How? -No idea. Mom? -What's back now? Who is that? -A physician. Are you injured? -No. Great, because I can't help you. -Are you not a doctor? No, I am a porter. I was covered in poop and puke. I just put this on. As a mother you are stuck understanding of babies. I can really use your help. We are on our way home. - She doesn't like helping people. Please? Do I have to beg? This way. I'm Ash. It was really here a madhouse in recent days. I cleaned up all the bodies. Horrible. Just stay there. Where's the staff? The surgeon and nurses out there went looking for their family. Feel free to take something to eat and drink. Where are we going? -The basement is the safest. Our generator is still working. We are almost the only ones with light. Some people hope here to find help. We only have some medication and medical books. We make the best of it. This way. End of the hallway. Our big boy is there. Do you care for them? -I moved as many as possible. There were eleven, but some parents have come to get their child. But the rest ... I'm sure their parents won't come anymore. I have my hands full with them. There must always be one changed, fed or comforted. I can not anymore. Would you like to help me? Just one day. Half a day. Then I can sleep for a few hours. -We are sorry. We have to go home. I would like to help ... - But you don't do it. I get it. You think of yourself. - I'm thinking about my children. Let's go. -What does that half a day matter now? I know that, but ... -What is it? This is not for you. Damn. They're coming. Hide yourself. -What? Get under the car. Come. What was that? - It'll be back soon. Hurry up. Dear help. What happened here? Than? Damn. What is that? -No idea. Hey? I heard shots. -Do not be afraid. That thing is dead. Whatever it was. What happened? Those creatures ... have everyone in the bunker murdered. My children too. How terrible. I was in a locked room. I could not help them. They were under the bed constipated. They must have been terrified. I should have been with them. We are looking for our son. Daniel Ward. He works for you. - Are you Dance parents? Then a group fled. Where to? -No idea. I thought they were safe here. I have to bury them. I can not do it. We will help you. He is still alive. -God thanks. Where can he be? -No idea. Maybe he's looking for us. He is still alive. We will find him. What would go through her? I'll dig. You keep watch. What is it? I thought I'd been there. It's done, Rachel. Do you believe in God? Maybe it makes a difference if you believe in something. Do you want to do something for me? -Yes, say it. Bury me with my children. -No, please ... Just look away. - Put that gun away. Not so. What would you do? I hope you find Dan. I always liked him. I made up my mind. I sympathize with you. Via the rabbit hole she came in a straight tunnel ... which suddenly went down steeply. So suddenly Alice didn't realize. Out of the blue she fell into something what looked like a very deep well. Or the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly. At least she had enough time to look around ... and wonder what would happen. What would Dad do? Would he go home? That takes a while, from France. I remember that I fed you at night. It was like nobody else on earth. Only the two of us. You had a thick bunch of dark hair. You looked like a boy. What is it? I do not know if I make the right choices. It does not matter. I always put you first, but now everything is different. Nobody knows what to do. Everyone does something. That's not for me. Write everything down. Then you can check it off. Survived, succeeded. Funny jacket. - Thanks to you we are underground. This little one ... will never know her parents. What is it? -I hear it again. I saw light. Just leave me. You are kidding me. Really, I saw light. I don't think that's possible. -I'm sure. The injured man in the store ... He is here. Are you sure? -Yes, he's in the hallway. Did he see you? -Yes. What are you up to? Lie down again. You need to rest. What is it? He kept my daughter at gunpoint. Is that true? You are kidding me. Whatever happened leave it for what it is. We already have enough problems here. -Stay away from us. What are you going to do? -Here's more light. It is tissue. A kind of nervous system. I don't know well what I expected from them. Maybe they are not this. -How do you mean? Their technology is much more advanced then ours ... but then again this is quite primitive. Would there be any other beings? -Could be. I see here ... a cerebral cortex. Shall I remove that? What did you do? if Dan had been dead? No idea. I do not sleep with that thing in one room. You are a natural talent. - You learn by doing. This guy loves music. Then he is so quiet. Where's your family? How terrible. -I stay strong for these little ones. You shouldn't be pulling anyone ... but this man just has something. Come. Light up. What's your name? Well? Jonathan. - I'm Chloe. I had the same when I first saw one. What happened? We wanted to go with a group of people Fleeing Paris ... and we came against a couple of those creatures. They killed the rest. The children too. Good Lord. Where are you going? -London. To my family. And you? I'm going to my parents. They live close to Amiens. My son is staying with them. Are we safe here? We are not safe anywhere. We take turns watching. I'll go first. Then you can sleep. Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. What is it? I'm not blind anymore. I can see again. Tom, where is Emily? What is it? -I can't find my daughter. It is not the same as before. It is different. How strange. Do my eyes look normal? I think so. Leave her alone. -Calm down. What are you doing? -Listen. I can see. I see you. I can see again. Why are they shooting? -Come down. Come now. What is it? I saw a woman last night. She ran. As if something was after her. -What then? I do not know. I don't think it was human. Now you really scare me. - Were those beings? Where are those weapons that I had with me? Are you a soldier? You're not leaving us, are you? -Where do I have to go? Happy. I'm just asking for certainty. Good Lord. I thought you were gone. -Do you want something? Is it useful to us? It's better than nothing. You screamed in your sleep. I was scared to death. -For real? What did I say then? It was French. Are you leaving? -Yes. Best. -You too. We can walk together for a while. We're both going north. If you want. Yes of course. I didn't dare ask. Pack your bags. We go. You look dull. Go and rest. I'll stay here. Why do you think so? that they want to kill us? Maybe because we are different. Only for that reason? - For some, that's reason enough. Can you shoot? - I know the balls. That means that I have no idea. Then get some sense. You don't say that. Does not matter. Teach me. The nearest bunker is in Whitehall. I think too that he would go home. If he's not there, we go to that bunker. What is it? Nothing. - Let's just go. What's up? I found Dan. What's the matter, Em? What is it? I don't see anything anymore. I woke up and was blind again. You may have imagined it. Do not you believe me? -Of course it is. Do you think it was fantasy? -No definitely not. What is happening to me? I do not know. Open the door. Open up. Why was he locked? You think you can make anything in a lab. Also biological weapons. In theory it is. And those robots exist inside from tissue? Yes, I think so. I want you to finish them all. Translation:BTI Studios
