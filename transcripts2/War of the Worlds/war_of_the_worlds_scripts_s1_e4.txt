 Do not worry about it. Maybe we can track them down. Based on the sounds. What do you need? We need the positioning system to locate the transmission. We have to position the dishes and link them to the generator. Can they detect it then? Yes. The potentiometer is working. The dish is intercepting something. With a different algorithm we can clean up the sound.

 I have found the source. It moves. - How? - I'm trying to follow. The signal becomes weaker. Is it flying? - The signal drops out. - Do something. We are losing it. - It's gone. - What are the last coordinates? 44.7472 degrees North latitude. 5.7691 degrees East longitude. It's nearby. In this valley. The signal is constant for 24 hours and now it suddenly disappears. Maybe they have detected us. We're going to take a look. Nathan, call the men together. What about me? I leave some men here they can protect you. Good?

 I should stay here, but... You want answers. We leave in an hour. What do you have there? It is a gift from Johannes. My birthday is soon. There are so many people that I will never see again... I can barely fathom it - Are you not going to open it? - Yes, but not now. Here, let me help. It is normal that you are scared. - Are you never afraid? - Yes. But in the long run you learn to hide your fear. Not too tight? Who are you? Put that weapon down. How did you get that? He doesn't speak French. Shasha! I was worried to death. Is everthing all right? - Are you injured? - No, I'm unharmed. I knew you were coming back. Where are grandma and grandpa? Sorry. I will never abandon you again. I thought you were... That was a long time ago. Are you all right, Mom? You look shocked. - Oh, this is my partner. - Hello. - Who is that? - Jonathan. We walked together. We were on our way home, looking for a hiding place. It was like grandma and grandpa had a stroke. I tried to help them. The people around me fell down dead. I could do nothing. Really, he stayed calm. It was very brave of him. Where are mom and dad now? - We buried them in the garden. - We can go and see. Gladly. Don't stay outside too long. - Alexi, Go with them. - That's not necessary. That's better. - Are you hungry? - Yes. - What is it? - It's suspiciously quiet. Take cover. Get out of here. Try to get some sleep. I will never abandon you again. I promise. Go to sleep. Sorry. I didn't know you were sleeping. What are you doing? Seeing how you are doing. - Where's Sacha? - He's asleep. Then leave him. Am I disturbing you? When they attacked... everyone who was outside fell dead down. Except for him. Isn't that crazy? Any idea why? That Jonathan seems sympathetic to me. - Just a bit of a cotton ball. - No idea. I barely know him. Is something going on between you two? - Did you do it? - He is married. You normally don't care. I haven't seen you in ages. It was really a long time ago. Your hair is nice. I like it. You can take this room. I can go sleep with Sacha. Sacha spoke often of you. He really loves you. It was good to be with him. We never discussed it There is nothing to say. - How long have you known? - I'm tired. - I want to go to sleep. - For how long? I want to go to sleep. When did you find out? As soon as I looked into his eyes. I wanted to give him up for adoption, but I couldn't. I don't know what you think happened... I know exactly what happened. - We had sex. - Not true. - I know it was wrong. - You raped me. Think what you want. I know very well what you did to me. You are lying. Why would you lie? Mom knew it. She knew what had happened. When she looked at Sacha, she saw you. That's why she made sure that we never visited together. So you and Sacha would never meet. Did you think that was a coincidence? When she looked at Sacha, she saw you. Not true. She died knowing that her son had raped his sister. You always walked around in your underwear. You went to bed with all those boys. You wanted me to hear it. You did that continuously. You provoked me all the time. What do you think that did to me? Don't play games with me. You knew very well what you were doing. I love my son dearly. But I think it's terrible that he looks like you. Do you want to protect him? Don't you want something to happen to him? I can protect him. I can protect you both. you take the bed. I'm sleeping downstairs. And? - Yanis and Lucas? - They are dead. Is everthing all right? Are you hurt? - I'm not hungry. - Come on, eat something. Shh. I know it hurts, but you have to be quiet.
