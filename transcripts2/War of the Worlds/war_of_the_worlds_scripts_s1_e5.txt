 Where the fuck is it? I do not see it. It's coming...it's coming...it's coming. Where the fuck is it! Let's get the fuck outta here. He wanted to play soccer at a big club.

 What should we do there? This was your idea. You wanted to trace the signal. You wanted to come. Pack your things. What is it? Do not shoot. -What is that? It's dead. My wife shot it. You better get inside. -Come on. Get in! Where are you going? -To my lab at the university. I trying to find a way to kill those things. - Well, best of luck with it. It's gone. -We are in an apartment nearby. You should come with us. There is coffee in the kitchen. Noah loves you. How do you know that? -After the attack, he was determined ...

 to find you and Sacha. I actually stopped. Are you still scared? to get cancer? I am pregnant. How far are you? Sixteen weeks. Bad timing. Where's the father? What are you going to do? -Can I do something then? What is it? Tom? Oh MY GOD! -It's OK. It's dead. What's it doing here? - Just ask them. I have to go. You are safe with your brother. You think? I hope you find your family. Say hello to Sacha, do you want? Good Luck. I have some blankets for you. -Thank you. There is also a double bed. -He's my ex. We'll be fine here. Have you seen other people? - One. Where happened to them? -She... is with her children. I'm glad you're here. I'll let you settle in. Is that the brain? See how close are the neural networks? There is a correlation between the density and level of intelligence. What does that mean? Larger animals, such as an elephant, have a bigger brain ... but less dense neural networks. A bird has a smaller brain, but denser neural networks. In short, you are more intelligent when you are dense. Is that meant funny? -A little. Do they have the same brain? like birds? No, the neural structures are very different. It's a killing machine. It is not capable of advanced technology. And what does that mean? This is the monkey, not the organ grinder. It doesn't hang like that. A mirror. Maybe a scanner. -Is it an eye? There is no optic nerve to the brain. How the hell can that thing see? -Is it blind? What is the mirror for? My sister is blind. At least she was. Since the attack, she can see again. How do you mean? She can see again, but not like back in the days. It is different, she says. How different? You'd better ask her that. Could it use sonar? Just like a bat. That could be. Good question. You know what the most important discovery is? Ignorance. Then it became clear how little we knew, we started looking for answers. I didn't want to disturb you. I'll let you get on with it. Is she okay? Our son... was a little older than you. Did those creatures kill him? What are you reading? -A book. What is it about? -About a man who harms people. Why? I do not know. I think he enjoys it. Do you like it to read such things? Not really. I don't like to read. How do you feel? Everthing allright? You tell me. Do you want breakfast? -No. Maybe later. What's up with Sacha? He acted strangely to me. Maybe he doesn't like you. He liked me before you came. He is probably puberty. Did you not make coffee? You have always been lazy. You also came to your bed in the morning not matter if you had to go to school. Horrible. Mom went crazy. So your boyfriend will volunteer have it finished? What a dork. His family is dead. -You do not know. Have you considered to go with him? That would not have been smart. Only stupid people dig their own grave. He can only hope on a quick death. We also. Don't say that. Don't let me hear that again. You are back. I have something for you. -What then? Your stick was still in the hospital. -Thank you. We will search the other houses for food. Do you want something special? Spaghetti hoops. I'll see what we can find. Are you still coming, casanova? Hi, honey. Are you hungry? There are muesli bars ... and Ash has found a gas set. I can make beans and eggs. What is it? There is something there. It is such a creature. It's dead. How do you know it's there? -I can feel it. What is it doing here? Ash and Kariem are Encountered Bill and Helen. He wants to figure out how you like them kills. Don't do that. Just stay away from it. You must be Emily. How did it die? It attacked me. My wife shot it. What is it? I felt it. How it died. I don't know what's happening to her? Tom says she started to see again since the attack. It comes and goes, she says. - Don't you believe her? According to the doctors she would remain blind. At the age of 13 she got it Stargardt's disease. Has she had this before? Hallucinations. That is possible according to the doctors. But this is different. She also hears everything. What then? "A pulsating sound," she says. Only she hears it. It stinks so bad! Someone has already been here. Are you planning on making a move soon? -Make a move? Emily, I mean. Does she like me? If you don't see that, are you blinder than she? Do you see a can of macaroni somewhere? -No, decent people lived here. They ate fresh and organic. They are just as dead now. He must have hidden there during the attack. - Poor drunk. Go talk to Bill. He knows everything about neurology. Leave me alone. Will you please just fuck off! What are those pills for? Your hand is shaking. What is wrong with you? Answer. I have muscular dystrophy. Is it hereditary? Can Sacha get it too? Sorry. We have to get out of here. We go. That sound. Don't you hear it? -Come with me. Hurry up. Where did you see them? -300 meters away. How much? -To one now. Do what I say. And Alexis? -Do you want to wait? Come. Get out of here. Fast. Come on, Noah. Run. Hurry up. Come on, walk on. You never save that. Walk around. See you at the factory. Go now. The door is locked. Open up. - You shouldn't have done that to Mom. Open the door. Open it, damn it. What are you doing? You shouldn't have done that to Mom. This is probably where the signal came from. Give me the map, Nathan. Look. Here the signal dropped out. Has it been knocked down? If there were soldiers here, we would have known. Where's Noah I tried to help him. For real. It's not your fault. You came back. We have to get off the road. Come. What is that? -It's a kind of tissue. Everthing allright? What is it? A creature like that passed by. It's like they don't see us. Maybe they are damaged due to the crash. They don't look damaged. No movement. What lies there? -No idea. Would they be this? Would they look like this? It is charred. You hardly see what it is. How far are you? -I just started. They took some babies from the hospital. What do you mean? They killed everyone, but the babies were gone. Why would they do that? It's me. Karim. Can I come in? I have something for you. I don't want surprises. -You probably like it. Please. You said you missed it. Single beds. Just like in the old days, at your parents' home. Do you remember? They'd be in every couple of minutes. They didn't want their good catholic daughter to burn in hell. That ship had sailed. What did you play there? I do not know. I don't know how I it. Give me your hand. So embarrassing. What? In the shop where we met ... I peed on you. The world is in ruins. And you are worried you pissed on me? I pointed a gun at you. I was scared. Sorry. -We are even. Do you think it's too soon, considering the events? Too soon for what? -To have sex. Would you like to? What does it mean? No idea. A friend has chosen it. Is it the symbol of your people? Something like that. Translation:BTI Studios...MrGoogle...BigDickus
