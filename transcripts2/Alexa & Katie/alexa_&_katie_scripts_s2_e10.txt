 Hannah, that looks incredible! This ain't my first craft table, ladies. Masks in the gift bags is such a fun idea. Oh, that's just the beginning. I'm telling you. My birthday party is going to be so amazing other parties are gonna try to crash it. Wait till you see my dress. It's stunning. Well, not so stunning that I'll upstage you, but like right up to that line. Speaking of right up to that line...

 I thought for sure Katie was gonna tell Ryan how she felt last night. Ugh, I know. She was so close! Stupid exploding coffee machine that makes delicious lattes. I hope she's able to get it fixed. She's at Wired right now. Leave it to Katie to find someone to repair it on New Year's Day. I'm not surprised. We're talking about the same girl who figured out how to make $2,000 and pay for London herself. - She's incredible. - Way better than us. I feel like Katie and I are on the same level. Okay, fine. She's better. These things are complicated. You've gotta take care of them the right way.

 You should have just told this Ryan guy how you felt. Yeah, you're right. So, how's it looking? All fixed. Really? Oh, thank you! Who's paying for this? I broke it, so I am paying. I'm just so relieved that it's fixed. That'll be $2,100. Good one! Oh. You're going back to school tomorrow, and I can't find your backpack anywhere. Oh well, I guess I can't go. Come on, bud. We had a nice, long break. We celebrated the holidays, we got to hang out and watch movies. Ordering pizza. Stay in our pajamas as long as we wanted. Oh, remember when we went out for pizza in our pajamas? Oh God, that was fun. But... tomorrow it's time to go back to the real world. Hmm? Hey, it's gonna be great! I don't want to go back to work. Uh-oh. You couldn't find someone to fix the espresso machine? No, I did, but... it cost a lot more than I thought. Oh, maybe I can help. Grandma just sent me 50 bucks to buy a skimpy dress to catch a man. I was just gonna buy more sweats at Costco, so it's all yours. - It cost $2,100. - What? That's all your money. You can't pay that. I already did. It was my fault. I had to. Well, there's gotta be something we can do. No, there's no time. The money is due this week. Everything I've worked for is gone. No acting program, no London. Honey. Honey, I'm so, so sorry. I guess I'm... ... not the kind of person who throws parties on rooftops. Or tells boys that she likes them, or... ... or goes on big trips. No, no, you are that person. You made a mistake, and you took responsibility for it, and you will take amazing trips one day, I promise. I hate coffee. Oh, Alexa's coming over. I don't want her to know yet. Why? After everything she's been through... Her birthday, it has to be great, okay? Woo-hoo! Ha-ha! Birthday girl! Oh, birthday girl! Woo-hoo. So, what happened to the coffee machine? Dot fifty bucks. Boom! Machine fixed. That's great! I know! Aren't we supposed to take your decorations to the ballroom? Yes, we are! When I say "ball," you say "room." Ball! - What? - Yeah! I'm so happy, I can't stop smiling. Man, we are on fire. We updated our Instagram. Nailed down our rules on sideburns. No longer than a pinkie. No wider than a thumb. Nothing can stop this band. Guess who's back from St. Lucia? Gwenny! - Wow! You got so much sun! - Sun? Ugh! This is a spray tan. That's why I let myself in. The lady said knocking could smudge my finish. I've missed you. I missed you... and American Froyo. Let's go. Are you gonna let her interrupt us? Oh, I didn't know I was interrupting something 'cause this looks like nothing. Let's go tomorrow. Umm, no. Umm, why? Because I'm back! We should leave. - After we make a sandwich? - Totally. I give you Alexa Mendoza's sweet 16 party space! I love it! I can't wait to majorly party. - Majorly! - Wait till you see the fountain. So these New Year's decorations will come down, and your Mardi Gras will be up. The DJ will be there, photo booth, and I want the dessert part there, so... The foot traffic doesn't back up by the dance floor. Exactly. - Are you in event planning? - Life planning, Brian. And the place settings, I want those set out last. So the silverware doesn't get jostled. - I hate a crooked fork. - Hmm. Maybe we can set the guest book by the door, so people see it when they come in. Oh, that's a very unique idea. I'll just... rearrange everything, so that we can have a guest book by the door. I'm so sorry. You're embarrassing me in front of Brian. Anyone can place a guest book. Let's see Brian fly a plane. You're going all out for this party! Alexa, come see! Oh, yeah, go see! Are you okay? Uh, yeah! No. I, uh... I only have the energy to fake it in front of one person. I used all my London money to fix the coffee machine. - Oh no! - Are you serious? Don't say anything to Alexa, okay? I'm going to tell her after her birthday. No hugs, okay? Hugs bring it up, and I've gotta smush it down. We have to earn the money back. I can stand in the lobby and scream... with a sign that says, "Pay me to stop screaming." I'd pay her to stop screaming. Thanks, guys. Oh, here she comes! Okay, get this. So last night's party didn't use their confetti cannons, so we got them! Try to say "confetti cannon" without smiling. You can't! When I think about your party, I can't say anything without smiling. Global warming! Honey, how are you doing? Is there anything I can do for you? Oh, thanks, Mom. Don't worry about me. It will only make me feel worse. Well, I made your favorite sandwich. Ham and cheese. That is not your favorite, but that's what we had. Listen, call me if you want to talk today, okay? - Okay. Bye. - Bye. Jack, you're going to be late for school! Molly, hey, it's Jennifer. Listen, I woke up with a horrible sore throat today, and also, like, a rash. And, um, the last thing I want to do is, you know, like, make anyone else itchier. Yeah. You take care, too. You're great. You're great at your job. Okay. Yeah, bye. Oh, yes! - Hey! - Oh, morning. So, the caterers gave us cake samples, and I wanna get your opinion. Try the chocolate. Mmm. This is the one. No, I vote for red velvet. So you're pretty much voting for whatever's in your mouth. Stand by. Yeah, vanilla. - I thought you'd be back to work today. - Oh, yeah. No, I'm sick. You're faking because you don't wanna go back? Oh, you get me! The holidays were such a whirlwind. I just need one more day. I have a bad headache and a very sore throat, and my stomach hurts. Ow. Looks like you've got a sick buddy. Jack, are you sure you're not pretending to be sick just so you can stay home? Of course not. That's lying, and lying is wrong. Sounds like somebody's a pretty good mom. Ooh. - Sorry, I wasn't looking. - No, it was my fault. How was your break? - It was good. - Good. I mean, my break... was good. Not that your break was good. Not that I'm not good with your break being good. Good. That's how I feel about your break... being good. Uh, so my birthday's coming up... and I was thinking if you want to come to the party, you can! But if you don't want to come then I don't want you to. No, I mean, I... I, um, I don't want you to if you don't want to. Yeah. I mean, I don't want to not come. Yeah. - You know what I mean? - Yeah. So... I've been avoiding Ryan, all day. It's just I haven't had the heart to tell him I'm not going to London. I've never been so miserable. Hey, birthday girl! Look at you with your french fries. You're as excited about my birthday as I am! More! I was thinking... I forgot something. I've gotta go. Okay, well... I was gonna tell Katie that there's a meeting about London for us and our parents next week. Because she is going on that trip. Yes, she is. Yeah, she's not really answering my texts, or staying in the same hallway as I'm in. At least they have the drama trip. There's no way that Katie won't tell him she likes him while they're in London together for a week. Yep. Why are you crying? Why am I crying? Tell me. Now. Katy spent all her London money fixing the espresso machine. What? Don't tell Katie Reagan told you. See, nobody expects Ell to be able to handle law school because she's blonde. But she's showing them. She has a little dog in her purse. Oh, this cold seems to come in waves. Yeah, I'm... I'm getting the chills. I think I need a little more hot chocolate. Oh, um, top me up. I get to pick the next movie. I got one where stuff blows up. Oh, really? I watched a movie about law college. Hi! I made you chicken soup. Aww! Why are you playing into this? I can't help myself. Even when people are faking sick, I have to take care of them. This is a scam. Nobody in this house needs a soup or blankets or... Legally Blonde! Wait, no, no. This is wrong. I know, but what can I do? Jack will lose all respect for me if I stop lying to him now. Oh, you brought soup! Um, uh, any more cake samples? Um, uh, you know, to cool down my stomach after the soup. To cool your stomach. Really? No one is buying... She's getting cake, isn't she? Excuse me. - Yeah? - My latte's cold. My dreams are shattered. Can I get another latte? My pleasure. This baby hums! Awesome. I can't believe that you broke this, paid to fix it, and still told me about it. Your honesty makes me uncomfortable. I'm a good person, Barry. The good, sad person. Happiness is for morons. I gave it up years ago. - Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey! How are you? Great! Why wouldn't I be? Not for any reason I know. Me neither. Oh! Be right back. Ooh! Too hot. It's fine. Barry, you have to give Katie a bonus or an advance on her paycheck. Just, like, $2,000. If I had $2,000, I'd buy my car back. Wait, no. Barry, I'm serious! You have to help Katie! - Katie! - Alexa! - Everything okay? - Great. Why wouldn't it be? Not for any reason I know. Well, I should go. Have a good day! I'm going to have a great day! Oh, yeah. How did I get stuck in the storm? What the heck? Oh, you have to make sure you're in the bubble, but you'll get the hang of it. I'm thinking we'll be sick all week. - All week? - Mhm-mhm. Jack, I need to tell you something. I'm not really sick. What! And neither are you. You're going to school tomorrow, so you go do some homework. I'll return some work e-mails. Okay. - After ice cream? - That's my boy. I can't write any lyrics on this napkin. It keeps ripping. - You want my notebook? - No. Everyone knows all the best songs started on a napkin. I'm learning so much in this band. - Gwenny! - Gwenny. I brought over your souvenir from my trip! "My girlfriend bought this in St. Lucia." Cool! It's a shirt, and it tells a story! Yeah. I was texting you all afternoon. I thought you lost your phone in your pocket again. No, I had it turned off 'cause I was working on lyrics with the band. Aww! That's adorable. If you wanna play band with your friends, I won't interrupt your jam session. The guitar sounds great. No one's playing anything. I'm being supportive. Does everyone think we're a joke? Don't listen to her, guys. I believe in this band. Nobody underestimates The Snickerdoodles. Are we set on that name? See, I told you. If we sit perfectly still, they don't see us. The Snickerdoodles? Hey. Sorry, I'm late. It's okay. We're just going over the last few details for your party. Wanna make sure you're okay with the seating arrangement. Yeah. Great. Oh, honey, you still thinking about Katie missing London? I know it's heartbreaking. She worked so hard to make it happen. She deserves to go. Sometimes life can be really unfair. You know that better than anyone. Yeah, but when life was unfair to me, Katie did everything that she could. But she'd want your birthday to be special. I know. I'm gonna go get the sad sweater. I'll call the caterer tomorrow. I'll make the final payment to the hotel on the vendors. Okay. I just realized what will make my birthday perfect. You look incredible! You look beautiful. Are you ready for your fabulous, unstoppable sweet 16? Not yet. I've to tell you something first. I know about London. What? How... It doesn't matter. Exactly. Yeah, I'm fine, and we've got an awesome party to go to. Katie. I don't want to ruin your night. You're not. I know how much that trip meant to you. So, I thought about what you would do if something like this happened to me. Alexa, what did you do? What you would have done. I made some changes to my party... so there would be money for your London trip. What? - No, no, you can't... - I already did. The money is handed in. So you're kinda stuck. But your big party. I don't need a fancy ballroom or a DJ or a confetti cannon. Helping you follow your dreams... is better than any party. I can't believe you did this for me. Yeah, of course I did. I would do anything for you. You're my best friend. Katie, you're going to London! I'm going to London! Thank you. This... This means everything to me. They're incredible. Were we ever this good of friends to each other? Not even close. Thank you. All right. We need to pull ourselves together. Because there's still a party happening. - Yes! - Yeah! Megan! You threw me with that last-minute change of venue, but I like it. There's still a dessert bar, right? What do you think? I think your first ex-boyfriend just walked in. Hey! Happy birthday. I'm glad that you're here. Hey, it's my friend's birthday. Friend. I like that. Friends. Excuse me! Uh, I just want to thank all of you for being here. This party is more than just a birthday. It's a celebration of how far I've come. If the past couple years have taught me anything, it's that... I can't take things for granted. Especially all of you. So let's party! Am I the only one that doesn't know what happened to you? I don't know what you're talking about. I never know what you're talking about. - Happy birthday. - Oh, thank you. Uh, Ryan? I like you... a lot, and... ... I want you to know. I like you, too. A lot. - I feel good about this. - I definitely feel good about this. Me too! I wasn't watching. Can I have your attention? - Mom? - We needed free entertainment. Whatever happens, it'll be entertaining. Lex, I hope one day I'm half as brave as you. Happy Birthday. This one's for you. ♪ I used to be completely invincible ♪ ♪ Remember how I was so unbeatable... ♪ Whoa, he's really good. I knew he would be. - I am so relieved. - Me too. ♪ Nothing can hold me back ♪ ♪ From being next to you... ♪ - That's my boyfriend. - That's my best friend! ♪ ... back ♪ ♪ I'll never be stopped ♪ ♪ Nothing can hold me back ♪ Now, this is a sweet 16. This is the best birthday ever. I had a lot to celebrate that birthday. But I didn't need a big fancy party to do it. Just the people I loved. And most of all... Katie. 'Cause your best friend doesn't just enjoy the great moments of your life with you. They help create them. ♪ Never will surrender ♪ ♪ Never will take me down ♪ SDH created by: Chiranjib Sahoo
