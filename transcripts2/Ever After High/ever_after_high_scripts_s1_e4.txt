 all the voting is going to be on the MirrorNet. Me and Humphrey Dumpty. Are in charge of it. Let me save you some time, little bro. I'm quite certain I'll be named. Thronecoming King. After all, I am handsome. Hey, Raven. I already voted online for Thronecoming Queen. And I voted for you. Really? Why did you vote for me? I always win these things, and, well, You technically come. From a long line of queens. Thanks. I'm really glad you're turning the page. I mean, I'm the daughter of the Evil Queen and a Rebel, but that doesn't mean I'm trouble. Raven Queen, please report. To the headmaster's office at once. Can we get you something? Dragon-egg omelet? No, I'm good. Miss Trollworth! One dragon-egg omelet. So, Miss Queen, how is your Thronecoming float. Going, hmm? It's going good. Delightful, my dear. Oh! Can I ask you something? Of course. Why are you being nice to me? Ever since I didn't sign the Storybook of Legends on Legacy Day, I always thought that you, well, that you saw me. As trouble. You? A troublemaker? Of course not! But funny you should mention. Legacy Day. As you know, Thronecoming is one of the few days a year the Storybook of Legends. Is removed. From its protective case and displayed for the public. And a perfect time for you to reconsider and sign in front of the whole world. I'm sorry, headmaster, but I made my choice on Legacy Day. I want to write my own destiny, not follow in the footsteps. Of my mother. Now if there's nothing else, I'll be going. Would you like this boiled? Or fried? She doesn't understand. We must stay true to the stories. Last one to touch the heart tree is a dodo egg. Come on, little brother! We're always going to be best friends, right, Milton? Yeah, always. Thronecoming at last. The key! The door is open. You ready? I can't wait to finish my float. And I did it all without harming a single flower. Harming a flower? Hey, plants have feelings too, you know. You go ahead. I just need. To sew up this skirt. Okay, see you there. Ow, my finger! Oh! Who wants pizza? I sampled a slice and it is just right! Ooh, meatlovers' pizza. Look, our fairytale princes are talking strategy for the big game. Don't you just love it when they act all heroic? We're never going to beat. Beanstalk High at bookball. Oh, little brother! Don't be such a worrier. How tough can it be to beat a bunch of little beans, huh? Beanstalk High is filled with giants, Daring, not beans. Well, then we are in a lot of trouble, aren't we? ♪ They're gonna kick our tails, yeah! ♪ Hey, guys. You know, I was thinking. Maybe I'd try out for the bookball team. I'm wicked fast. Oh, well, that sounds good... ♪ But you're a girl, oh! ♪ So what does that. Have to do with it? Sorry, Cerise, damsels are for saving, not playing fairytale-back. Boys! Hi, Tiny. Guys, I think I know a way we can win against the giants. Huddle up! Nice float, Apple! It's totally off the page. Thanks, Raven. It's got the apple tree that you poison me from... Or, um, might poison me from. Apple. Oh, it's okay, Raven. You'll come around. I just know it. Come around? I've tried to explain this to you every way I know how. I want to write my own destiny. And to be honest, when it comes to this, I think you're being selfish. You... you think I'm being selfish? All you care about is your own happily ever after. You know, because you didn't sign the book, all of our stories could go poof. We could all go poof! Yeah, but we didn't. Yet. Raven, I don't want you to sign the book for me. I want you to sign it so that nothing bad happens to the people that I love, including you. If you ask me, you're the one who's being selfish. Briar? Briar? Get up! Oh, no! How long have I been asleep? Well, you missed float building. But that's one. Of the best parties of the year. It's okay. It's not like... No, it's not okay! Is this what. It's going to be like. When I sleep for 100 years? I'm going to miss out. On all the fun and... And my friends. You always knew. This was going to happen... That you were going to be the next Sleeping Beauty. I know, but now... it just feels real. Well, you haven't signed the Storybook of Legends yet. Ashlynn! Look, Briar, you wouldn't be the first person to question your destiny. I mean, I already signed and I kind of wish I hadn't. Who knows what's going to happen. To Hunter and me? So you're saying I shouldn't sign? I should rebel? I'm saying that you have choices. Did I make the wrong choice? Hey, who threw that?! Very good. That's far enough. Now you're about to discover a most unique building here at school. It's called Heritage Hall! Madame Yaga? Where is it? Well, you see... Heritage Hall is a magical structure! It only appears during Thronecoming. Wow. Wow! Whoa! Whoa! Heritage Hall is dedicated to those who came before you... Your parents, the alumni of Ever After High. Now if everyone will gather around the Storybook of Legends, I'd like to tell you about your Thronecoming treasures. When your parents were students, they were given the chance to leave gifts for any of their children who might attend this school. Yes, well, let's get to it. Yay! Oh, running shoes! Those bears will never catch me now. Thanks, Mom. Sweet! A picnic basket with an electronic mirror lock. Hairbrushes? We already have, like, a million of... Wicked! Oh, a super-soft neck-supporting pillow. Great. Glasses? I don't get it. Why would my dad... Wait a splinter! Oh, I can't tell a lie, and neither can these glasses. They're revealer rays! Whatever After. They probably don't even work. Well, they're telling me. The truth about your dress... ...which is not a real Hans Christian Dior like you've been. Telling everyone it is. I... I... What did you get, Raven? It's a coin. The wishing well? What am I supposed to wish for? Wait. I know. I wish to know what happens to my friends if I don't sign the Storybook of Legends. The stepsisters! Run! No! Giles, check it out. The ogre's cave. Whoa. We'd better get out of here. Are you scared? Uh, yeah. Don't you remember the story. Father told us? No one has ever gone into that cave and come out alive. Oh, please! That's just a story. They don't all come true, you know. Milton, no! Okay, Tiny, so what's the secret to beating the giants from Beanstalk High? All giants have a weakness. Our little toes are really ticklish. So, like, this is enough. Right here? Ooh ooh! Uh-oh! Guys? Hey, guys? Have you seen Apple? Nope. But, hey, wouldn't you rather hang out with the coolest dudes at Ever After? Good luck on your adventure, fair maiden. Lizzie, do you have any fairy fives? No! Off with your... Wait a spell. Are those your revealer rays? I wish I could. Just tell a lie. Hey, have you seen Apple?! No. Not me. Where is she?! I'm just saying, we have vegetarian days in the castleteria. Why not meat days? Apple! There you are. Finally! Raven, you'll have to wait your turn. I'm... I want to sign. The Storybook of Legends. Whoa! No way. No way! Um, meeting adjourned. Headmaster Grimm? You're never going to believe it. The best thing ever after has happened! Really? And what is that? I want to sign the Storybook of Legends. Isn't that spelltastic? It certainly is. Whatever changed your mind? Apple was right. I was being selfish. I don't want anything to happen to our friends. Well! I'm glad you finally see the story from our point of view. I shall make the arrangements! The Thronecoming parade will be seen by millions in the magical world. It'll be the perfect time for you to sign your destiny. Uh, millions? Can you believe it, fairytale fanatics? Raven Queen is going to sign the Storybook of Legends. Why, this is the most epic thing to happen since... Since she didn't sign the Storybook. First up, Huntlynn... That's my cute name for Hunter and Ashlynn. It's just when Raven decided not to sign, we thought there was hope for us. Yeah. Wait! Raven's gonna sign? Honey, you really need to read the MirrorBlogs. Well, Raven convinced me. - She doesn't want anything. To happen. - To her best friends. Ever after. - And what's the hatter. With that? Ah! This changes everything! Uh, this doesn't change anything. Oh! Well, all I have to say is only two more days to vote for Thronecoming Queen and King! So get online and vote! Me? Well, Raven signing the Storybook of Legends means we'll each play our part. And I'll sleep for 100 years. And so as Thronecoming approached, the girls were getting their dresses fairest at the fitting forum. Can you believe it? Raven is going to sign! Ha. It's like my birthday and New Chapter Day and True Hearts Day all wrapped into one... Ow! Ooh, a little tight, don't you think? Anyway, all wrapped into one beautiful present. Argh! We get it! Whoa. What's ruffled your feathers? It's just... It's not as easy as you make it sound, Apple. What's not? Following our destinies. I mean, you really think I want to sleep for 100 years? Well, you are going to miss out. On all the great parties. Is that how you guys see me? Just a party girl? I don't want to sleep because I'm going to lose all my friends. I'm gonna be alone. How do you think that feels? I never thought about that. Well, I have. And now. That you're gonna sign, Well, it changes everything. But, Briar, we all have our part to play. Easy for you to say, Apple. You get poisoned for, what, like a week? Oooh! Briar, I'm sorry you're upset, but... I'm happy for you, Apple. I'm happy that Raven is going to sign, but now I don't think I want to. Whoa. Milton? Milton, what if the ogre catches us? It's just a story! There's no such thing... Ha! Giles? Giles! Ahh! Lance Charming here with Ever Action News! The first floats are coming down the street, and don't they look spellbinding? Now don't forget, folks, Headmaster Milton Grimm has promised a very special surprise at the end of the parade route. Remember to tune in later today and find out what it is. Reporting at the scene in Bookend, I'm Lance Charming. That's a wrap. And so as many of you remember, there was a minor, ahem, chapter break at Legacy Day. But I'm happy to report that has now been resolved. Raven Queen is going to sign the Storybook of Legends! Oh. That can't be! Somebody is not telling the truth! My name is Raven Queen. Raven! Raven! And I... Raven! Raven! Miss Wood, split! Raven! That's not the real. Storybook of Legends! That's a fake! Uh, calm down. Thronecoming pranks are a traditional occurrence. This isn't a prank! My revealer rays only tell the truth. And that is not the real. Storybook of Legends! Calm down. This has gone far enough. Miss Queen, it is time for you to sign the book and seal your destiny. I'm sorry, but if Cedar says the book is fake, then it is. Raven, no! I guess I should have known better than to trust you, Raven Queen. You probably did all this just to make me look foolish! No, I want to sign! I really do, but... This isn't the end. They know. They know you switched them! I ask you again, where did you hide the real Storybook of Legends?! Okay, Thronecoming? Totally off on the wrong slipper. Well, since the book is a fake, at least Raven can't sign and I don't have to decide. What I'm going to do. Unless... Unless what? Unless Raven decides to go looking for the real. Storybook of Legends. She wouldn't do that. Would she? Maddie! You have to help us find the real book. Meow. Hey, um, maybe we should talk outside so Kitty doesn't hear. Don't worry. When she's taking a cat nap, nothing wakes her up. So you'll help? Of course! Raven's totally got me seeing the Royal side of things, and I can't say no. To her. Or a good cup of tea! If there's one person who knows everything that goes on at this school, it's the person. That lives under the school. So who exactly are we looking for? From the nest to the sea comes the bird made of three to seek truth, beauty and me. It's hat-tastic to see you too, Giles! Giles Grimm? The one and only. I... I knew the headmaster. Had a brother, but... Feathers and friends, together, alone. He says hi. What's he doing down here? Well, he only speaks Riddlish, so we don't really know. But if the real Storybook of Legends is near, he can absotively point us in the right direction. Pages and chapters and bookmarks abound, but where can freedom truly be found? He's talking about the book. I'd better write this down. Hold, please. I know there's some parchment in here somewhere. Father! Father! Milton, what is it? It's Giles! I dared him to go into the ogre's cave. But I told you the story. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Found it! And so the big day finally arrived. The Thronecoming bookball championship! Big day? No. The big day is the Thronecoming dance. Uh, football game. Thronecoming dance. Cool it, you two-de-doo! The game is about to start. I forgot she could hear us. Okay, now these giants from Beanstalk High? They are tough. However... Um, Coach Gingerbread Man? Sorry to interrupt, but it's all good. We've got a plan. Hex, yeah, we do! Tiny told us that all giants. Have a weak spot. On their little toes. True, but that's why the other team is wearing toe protectors. I'll stay on the bench! ♪ Yeah yeah yeah! ♪ Okay, now is the perfect time to go looking for the book. Wait a spell. Let's grab Cedar. Those truth-telling glasses will let us know if we find the real dealio. Huh? Where are they going? I don't know. Oh! Major fairy fail. Giants, giants, giants! So you think the real Storybook of Legends is hidden in here? This is where the clue leads! "Where the stories of the past come alive, revive and thrive." See anything, Cedar? Hmm. No, just a... Wait a splinter. I think the Storybook of Legends is in the Storybook of Legends. Whoa! Ugh! Oh, come on! But they're so fast! Why aren't you doing. What I told you? Go go go! Wait a spell! I know a damsel who might just be able to rescue us. Cerise? Um, if you're not doing anything, you know, maybe you could... I'll get my shoes. It just won't budge. So what do we do? How about I give it a try? Blondie! Were you spying on us? A good reporter always knows where the story is. And if it is a lock you need to get past, well... ...that is kind of my thing. Wicked. I wonder if we're supposed to... Raven! Okay, did everyone and their fairy godmother follow us here? Well, I didn't follow you, but I got bored at the game, so I thought I'd come. Check this place out. What are you all doing here? We're trying to find the real Storybook of Legends so Raven can sign. I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that. Briar? If you find the real book, that means I'm going to lose you all. Briar, maybe we can find another... Raven, no! I'm sorry, Briar. Whoa! Whoa. What is this place? Look at all the writing. I think we're inside the book. Maddie, are there any more clues left? "A chapter for all to live and survive with a page of the answer and come out alive." The books! There are eight books. And there are eight of us. It sounds like a page from the real Storybook of Legends is hidden in each of these books. But how do we know which story is ours? We don't. I guess there's no going back. One... Two... Three! Three bowls of porridge? Well, I'm in Blondie's story. Uh-oh, bears! Oh, no, I'm in Apple's story! Eat, my dear. Eat. Ah! It's your destiny! Why do I feel... I'm in Cedar's story! Wait a spell! I'm in Ashlynn's story. Huh? It's midnight! Um, okay. This is... Off with your head! ...mad! I'm Cupid! Terrific! Ooh, I bet I'm supposed to make those bunnies fall in love! Or not. Am I... It worked, my queen. The poison worked. Now you are the fairest in the land. I did that? Oh no! A spinning wheel. Castle Tower? That must mean I'm in Briar's story. Well, as long as I don't... No. No! The pages! For ages, the pages. Yes, Cerise! Run! Run! - Yes, Cerise! Get it, girl! Whoo! We're going to get those gia... ah. Go go go! Run! Run as fast as you can! Go go go go! And the game is over! Cerise Hood scores the winning touchcrown! Ever After High wins! The page! Huh? Maddie, are you okay? Oh, yeah, but whew! I mean, Cupid's job is not all just hearts and kisses. Not my head! Oh, I don't ever want to go home with you on break. Whoo! Ah! So that's what it feels like when the slipper's on the other foot. You must eat! It's your destiny. No! You cannot escape your story! Raven, you made it! Briar! Are you okay? Oh, Raven. I had no idea. Wait a spell. Where's Apple? Briar's is the only book left! So if Apple has my story, and she fell asleep, she won't be able to find her page! I have to help her! Briar, wait! It's too dangerous. I have to! She's my best friend! Ah! Ah! I'm ending this chapter! Apple! Briar did it! Apple? Apple? Wake up. Wake up! You... you saved me. Of course. We're best friends. Forever after. That doesn't look like the Storybook of Legends. Well, what does it say? "Speech return! Words you say. Break this curse for our new day!" Nothing happened. But it did! You retrieved the pages so you could break my curse! He says we retrieved the pages... Giles, you can talk! Like, everyone- can-understand-you talk! Yes, Madeline. And for that, I thank you... All of you. It took extraordinary courage for you to face those challenges. You are all a credit to your stories. But, Mr. Grimm, if we weren't searching. For the Storybook of Legends, Do you know where it is? No. But I know who took it. Who?! The Evil Queen. My mother? My mother stole the Storybook of Legends! Why? I do not know, but I can tell you this. Years ago, your mother tried to expand beyond her story and bring evil to all the tales. And my brother and I... We stopped her. But why are you down here? Oddly enough, because of my brother. What? Why? Let me tell you a tale. A long time ago, when my brother and I were just boys... Giles? I'm so sorry! I will never go against the stories again! Ever. While I always respected our fairy-tale past, I also thought that each of us should be able to write our own destiny. And the headmaster didn't like that? Indeed he did not. He cursed me with that babble spell and imprisoned me here. But your curse is lifted now. Yes! Thanks to you extraordinary girls. Now come! Thronecoming is almost upon us. Are you coming with us? Well, now, I haven't been to a party in ages. I wouldn't know what to wear. We'll help. Help! Enough already! Enough! Ahem. Hey, Briar? Can you come help me with my hair? Uh, yeah. Um, coming. Huzzah! Yeah! Welcome, everyone... Ah! ...to Ever After High's. Thronecoming Dance! The school tradition where we spellabrate our stories and those who came before us. We'll get. To the big announcement, Thronecoming Queen and King, soon! But now let's get this party started! Follow me! Cerise? Oh, hey, Daring. I... I just want to say that, um, well, I am sorry I ever thought you were a damsel in distress, and you really saved us out there. So yeah. Oh, thanks. So how about a dance? Um, aren't there a few other girls ahead of me? But I... I'd rather. Dance with you. Madame Yaga? Yes, my dear? That picture... That looks like my dorm room, but who are those people? Why, that's Little Red Riding Hood and, uh, the Evil Queen. Miss Beauty? Cedar, do you have your revealer rays? I need to borrow them. The Storybook of Legends! Ahem. Hello, Apple. Uh, Miss Queen. Look, Headmaster, I know you're angry with me... To say the least. ...and I'm sorry. I really do want to sign the Storybook of Legends. You do? Yes. If I don't, that terrible vision. That I saw in the mirror. Will come true. Wishing well. You saw the vision in the wishing well, dear. I never told anyone I saw a vision in the well. Which means the only way you know about it is if you put it there. Headmaster Grimm, that was wrong. Well, I... uh... ahem! I did it to protect our stories. Raven needs to make up her own mind. She doesn't need to be tricked into doing what you think is right. We can be good and evil, happy and sad, Royal and Rebel, many things all at once. Giles? Bu... but that's impossible. Hello, brother. I missed you. And I forgive you. I missed you, too. Can we turn the page and start a new chapter? She's not really going. To throw the book down the well, is she? She doesn't want to lose - Her friends forever after. But it's a mistake. Oh, she'll realize that. For Briar's story is far from over. In fact, in the next chapter... Hey, zip it. What did I tell you about spoilers? And now it's time to announce the Thronecoming Queen. And King! Let's ask our MirrorNet experts to give us the results! - And the candidates - Are Apple White... Go on, tell 'em, Humphrey! Me? I thought you. Were going to count 'em up. That was your job! I had to put the web site. Back together again. After you broke it. Me? Oh, man! Looks like you've got more time to get your votes in. So jump on the MirrorNet, log into MyChapter and make it happen. We'll announce the winners soon. Stay tuned! Meanwhile, here's a real page-ripper! Happy Thronecoming, everyone! Happy Thronecoming indeed. And if there's one thing - We've learned, It's that you can't judge a book by its cover. Especially a fairytale book. That's what I just said. Must you clarify every little thing? There's nothing wrong with clarification. I mean, come on, we've been through this. It's what good storytelling's - All about. You don't always have to - Have the last word. Of course, you do. Yes, I do.
