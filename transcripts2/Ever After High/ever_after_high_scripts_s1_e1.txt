Not anymore. Since you're such an important part of my story... You poison me. I fall asleep. The prince wakes you. With a kiss, blah blah blah. Yada yada, I know. So? So I asked Headmaster Grimm if we could live together. And he said yes. Isn't that enchanting? Uh, but... but... Oh, oh, oh. You are going to love rooming with me. I'm thoughtful. And beautiful. And I sing the most. Wonderful songs. About woodland creatures. ♪ Oh the doves love to fly. And the hares love to burrow. ♪ Move along. Move along. Nothing to see here. And I already decorated your half of the room. Apple: Isn't it just the evilest? I knew you'd love it. This is gonna be a long year. Male Narrator: Which brings us to the rehearsals for the Legacy Day ceremony. So when your magical. Key appears, You insert it gently into the Storybook of Legends, then stand shoulders back and declare your destiny to the world. Have I made myself clear? Headmaster Grimm, but what if... No questions? Good. Now, we're going to practice with this tiny manual of entirely reasonable school rules. Milton Grimm: Who will go first? I, Madeline Hatter, pledge to follow the destiny of dear old Dad, the Mad Hatter of Wonderland. When do I drink the tea? Milton Grimm: Next! I'm Hunter Huntsman and I pledge to follow my destiny as the next Huntsman. I'll swing my axe bravely and... Really, Pesky? You want to play that way? Milton Grimm: Next. I'm... I'm Cedar Wood and I pledge to follow my destiny and. Be the next Pinocchio. Well, I mean, not the next Pinocchio. I mean, actually, I can only tell the truth while I'm in school, but then one day... One day, I'm gonna lie. Uh, but does that mean that I'm gonna be like my dad or not like my dad? Milton Grimm: Next. I'm Raven Queen and I pledge to follow my destiny as... Um, I have a question. What is it? I was just wondering, I mean, What if I don't want to take the pledge? What? It's just a question. And here's your answer. If you don't pledge your destiny, your story ceases to exist. Ceases to exist? So then what happens to me? You will cease to exist. Poof. Now, Raven, continue. But, Mr. Grimm... Poof, poof! Um... I have to go. What about her destiny? Milton Grimm: Now, settle down, everyone. Male Narrator: In the Vault of Lost Tales, Deep beneath the school, another was listening. Male Narrator: Giles Grimm, the brother of the school's headmaster. The Raven flies. The clouds, they sing. But what should happen when the tide roles in? Male Narrator: What will happen, indeed? Female Narrator: Are you done? Can I tell my side of the story now? Male Narrator: If you must. Go on.. Female Narrator: In a faraway land, all eyes were on Apple as she made the most important declaration of her life. I am Apple White, daughter of Snow White. And I am ready to pledge my destiny. Male Narrator: - Of course you'd start. With Apple, Always playing favorites. Start at the beginning of the school year. Female Narrator: Oh, fine. Gather 'round, friends, and let us tell you a story, the story of. Ever After High. A high school. For the teenage sons. And daughters... Hmph. Of the most famous. Fairy-tale characters. Who ever lived. Female Narrator: - But this year. Was like no other. For the students. Of Ever After High. For it is the year of Legacy Day, a momentous event where the students pledge to all the magical world to follow the same paths as their fairy-tale parents. I can't believe it. Legacy happens this year and there is just ever so much to do. Totally, right? I mean, this year's after-party is gonna be a page ripper. I heard D.J. N-Chant is... Briar. It's not just. About the party. This is destiny. Future queen! We can't let anyone post embarrassing pictures of us on MyChapter. Hey, daughter of Sleeping Beauty. If I'm gonna be catching "z's" for a hundred years, I got to live it up now. And come on. No one would post. Anything bad about you. Everybody loves you. It's Apple White. Gorgeous. Tiny: Can I carry your books? Why, Tiny, aren't you the sweetest little thing? Thank you. See? They love you. Oh, oh. I don't want to miss a minute. Of our first day. Hi, everybody. Briar: - Hey, what's up? Howdy. Hey, Prince Daring. Um, why are you holding your hand over your mouth? Well, you see, I just got my teeth whitened. And Headmaster Grimm said I can't show people, 'cause... But your smile is so charming. Well, you know... Ah! My eyes! I can't see! Ah! Tiny: I'm okay. Apple, Daring... So any juicy dating details for my mirror-cast show? Talk to the mirror. Blondie, Daring and I are still not a couple. This is high school. We've got "forever after" to be together. But you two are the perfect couple... Not too this, not too that. You're just right. Come on, Apple. Let's go get some lunch. Charm you later. Oh, oh. Female Narrator: And so that night, Back in the Ever After dorms, Apple had a surprise waiting for her new roommate. You think Raven's. Gonna like this? Of course. What future evil queen. Wouldn't love... An evil throne, an evil crown, and an evil haunted mirror? True, but why are you doing this for Raven? Because she's such an important part of my story. When she poisons me, it changes everything. Then the Prince can wake me and I become queen. That's when I get. My "happily ever after." I need her. Raven: - Hey, Maddie? Uh, quick, hide. I don't want Raven to know. You helped me. I'll go out the window. I've never done that before. Whee! Welcome home, roomie. Huh, good one, Apple. I'm rooming with Maddie. This year. Not anymore. Huh? Man! I am good-looking. Whee! Daring, how'd you know I was gonna be here? Catching damsels. In distress... It's kind of my thing. Well, that was a total rush! Stay here. I'm going again! Hey, you want to get a Hocus Latte? Uh, that sounds magical. I love mine with nutmeg. How do you like yours? Oh, I like a lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta, lotta cream. Hey. Hi, Ashlynn. Want to go on a nature hike later? I haven't been. In the woods in days? And it just feels so good to get back to what really matters. I got a shipment here of 300 new shoes for the Glass Slipper. New shoes?! Where? It's a shoe thing. Well, she is. Cinderella's daughter. Ooh, time for our. Legacy Day rehearsal. I can't wait for everyone to get a glimpse of the queen I am going to become. Female Narrator: But what Apple didn't know. Was that Raven Queen had other plans... Male Narrator: - That would change. The world. For the better. For the worse. So when your magical key. Appears, You insert it gently into the Storybook of Legends, then stand shoulders back and declare your destiny to the world. Have I made myself clear? But what if... No questions? Good. Who will go first? Ooh, me, me, me. Mm, ah, ooh, ooh. Step right this way, my future queen. I am Apple White. And I pledge to follow my destiny as the next Snow White. Perfect. I know. I am Briar Beauty. And I pledge to follow in my mom's footsteps and sleep for a hundred years. But before I do, I'm gonna live every minute! Ooh, speaking of which, my dorm room Friday night, we're gonna blow the roof off the place. Milton Grimm: Next. Hey, there. Charming, Daring Charming. I pledge to be just like my old man, King Charming. Brave, good-looking, kind, good-looking, thoughtful, and good-looking. Next. I'm Raven Queen. And I pledge to follow my destiny as... Um, I have a question. What is it? I was just wondering, I mean, What if I don't want to take the pledge? She has to do it. I mean, if she never poisons me, then I'll never fall asleep. And I'll never be kissed. By my Prince. And I'll never become queen. And I'll never have my "happily ever after." Now, Raven, erase that dangerous idea from your head. Continue. I have to go. What? Hey, what about her destiny? The rules... I mean, the rules! Female Narrator: And so Apple took refuge that night in the enchanted forest, Wondering what would become of her destiny should Raven not follow hers. Headmaster Grimm? Forgive me for startling you, my dear. I need you to keep an eye on your roommate, Raven. We must follow the paths set out before us. It's the only way to keep our world safe. Please, watch Raven and convince her of this. I know you'll do whatever it takes. I'll... Female Narrator: And so... on the grave portent about to befall Ever After High... Male Narrator: Must you always be so dramatic? Female Narrator: Must you always ruin my ominous endings? Male Narrator: You're always taking the Royals' side. Female Narrator: I mean, I'm known. For my endings. Female Narrator: And so here we are... Legacy Day, where the students of Ever After High signed the Storybook of Legends, pledging to follow the paths of their fairy-tale parents. Male Narrator: Or not. Female Narrator: Seriously? I'm narrating here. Maddie, you have to help me. I don't feel like I can sign the Storybook of Legends, but I don't want. To let everyone down, either. And do not forget the whole, "If you don't sign, your story disappears. Poof! And you may vanish. Into oblivion." That's a thing, you know, And it's gotta hurt. But we don't know. If that's true. But what if it is? But what if it's not? But what if it is? You're not helping. Wait a tick. - ♪ I think I know. Who can help! ♪ No, but see... I am totally a Royal. Raven! There you are. We have to talk. Come back! Apple, where are you going? I have to convince Raven to sign the book. My destiny depends on it. Raven? If anyone knows the truth. About the Storybook of Legends, It's Giles Grimm. Feathers and friends, together, alone. He's speaking Riddlish. He was cursed. With a babble spell. Makes him sound. You know, bru-ru-ru, cuckoo. He says it's nice to have us here. Ask him about the book. If I don't sign, am I really gonna... disappear? Mm-hmm. Can a musical chair change its tone when the tablet of granite is inscribed with a bone? Hmm. The king who sings with pages of sky fears too much the dawn that rises with lies. He says there's. Something wrong with the book, And that if you don't sign, your story... will... What? What?! Oh, sorry. If you don't sign, your story will continue. Ah, really? Oh, that's great. I think. Uhh! You think? Hey! Riddlish is not an exact language. Female Narrator: At last it was Legacy Day. Next we have. Apple White. I am Apple White, daughter of Snow White, and I am ready to pledge my destiny. And next, Raven Queen. I am Raven Queen, daughter of the evil queen, and... I pledge... uh... I... Come on, do it! Ohh! I am Raven Queen, and I'm going to write my own destiny. My "happily ever after" starts now. Oh, no! Yay! Raven did it! I'm still here. I didn't disappear. How could you be so... so selfish? All: Boo! All: Yay! I'm sorry, Apple, but I... oh! Ahh! Hold everything! Raven: Ohh... I didn't know I could do that. I'm sorry, Apple, but I don't want anyone to tell me who to be. I want to figure that out. On my own. And don't you understand? I'm not the only one who gets to choose their own destiny now. We all do... even you. But I don't want to choose a new destiny. I liked the one I had, and because of you it might not happen. But it might. I don't know. I... I just don't know. Wow! You're still here. No poof, poof, poof. Yay! I know. It feels good. Male Narrator: - Life between the Royals. And the Rebels. At Ever After High would never be the same after Raven stood up for what she believed. Female Narrator: What she believed was wrong. She didn't honor her destiny. She tempted fate. Listen, narrators, we are trying to have a nice moment here. Raven does not know the forces she has released. This must be contained before her dangerous idea. Spreads.
