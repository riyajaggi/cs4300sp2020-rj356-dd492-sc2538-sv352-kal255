That holiday is dangerous. But... but... Some students might see it. As a sign. To break from their destinies. Maybe True Hearts Day is... Ahem. You are not to talk about this to anyone. Do you understand me? Yes, sir. I won't say a thing. True Hearts Day? I don't get it. Charades! 48 words. A holiday that used to be "spellabrated" in the fairytale world. That encourages us. To follow. Our true heart's desire. But Headmaster Grimm doesn't want anyone to know about it, but you think. We should "spellabrate" it Anyway. And throw a secret underground. True Hearts Day dance? Why didn't you just say that? 'Cause Headmaster Grimm told me not to say anything. Secret dance? What if Grimm catches us? He won't. Come on! It'll be happily ever awesome!

True Hearts Day! Aren't you just totally "hexcited"? It used to be such an important holiday on the royal calendar. Ah, love! Finding. Our predetermined princes. I'm sure, yeah. Oh, sweetie, what's wrong? You can tell me. I mean, we are friends forever after. I'm not sure you'd understand. What? Is it boy trouble? Oh, wow, hey! I am thirsty.

Daring? I had no idea he felt this way. 'Sup, brother? Oh, gort. Male narrator: Love is very... Female: Complicated. Male: Yes, complicated. Male narrator: The path of love is never straight. Female narrator: Well, it was until people. Started choosing. Their own stories. Male narrator: You must admit, this is much more interesting. Female narrator: Mmm, well, let's see what happens. Hey, Ashlynn. What's up with. The urgent text message? Is every... Shh! Sorry, Cedar, but I need help. We need help. Uh, Hunter? Shh! I'm not Hunter. I'm, uh, Gunter. Gunter Guntsman. Is this about your guys' secret relationsh... Shh! Yes, it is about... that. Duchess knows, and she's going to spell it out. For the whole school. We don't know what to do. Well, I always find it's best to tell the truth. You're right, Cedar. Gunter Guntsman! I got a triple mint. Hocus latte for Gunter Guntsman! Over here! I got party supplies! C.A. Cupid! I'm Cupid! That's me. Just sign here. Party supplies? Why, yes, party supplies um, for... Our play. And what exactly is the name of this play? It's, uh... All: Um... uh... It's called. "The Play That Almost Was. And Then Wasn't. But Then Was." Mmm. Very well. I don't know, Duchess. It is a bombspell, but Ash and Hunter are my friends. If you don't report on it, someone else will. No, they can't own it! Now I'll never get my happily ever after! Oh, hey, Duchess. Apple White: Ashlynn? You and Hunter are... are dating? But you're a Royal. And he's a Rebel. ♪ Totally awkward, oh! ♪ Female narrator: A Royal dating a Rebel? That's just not how the tale is told. Male narrator: She followed her true heart, Which is kind of what True Heart's Day is all about. So, fellow fairy tales, Blondie Lockes here to give you reaction to the royally rebellious romance. I think it's "hexcellent." Ashlynn and Hunter decided to rewrite their destinies. What's wrong with that? Oh! I feel for them. I mean, keeping secrets is hard. Ahh! A Royal and a Rebel? Ha! They're from. Two different worlds. I am trying to do an interview here. I'm worried. About Ashlynn and Hunter. If they don't. Follow their destinies, Their books could close... forever. Remember our quiz. Tomorrow. On tiara size and future neck problems. Apple, we have to talk. Ash, this is hard for me, which is a first because I usually handle everything so very well. I know. I'm just so surprised. You didn't trust me enough. To tell me. I didn't think. You'd understand. I guess I don't. It just. Doesn't make sense to me. I don't want to see anything bad happen to someone I care so much about. And so you're telling me all these heartshaped cakes are for your play? Yeah, the play! Yep! You know it! They're for. The really funny scene. Where Briar throws them at Hopper! Excuse me? Oh, yeah. It's such a funny scene. I just wind up and ugh! Very well. Hi, Ashlynn. Duchess! What do you want? What do I want? My own happily ever after, of course. And now that everyone knows that you're dating a Rebel, it looks like. There's one available. No glass slipper for you! Hmm! So you're happy about Hunter and I dating while my best friends aren't? Maybe I did make a mistake. What? No! You're totally doing the right thing. Follow your heart and all that sappy stuff. Sorry, I'm saving this for Ashlynn. Hey, Ashlynn! Ahem. Hunter, we need to talk. Uh, Ashlynn? I just... I thought this would be a good thing, showing everyone we were dating. I thought it would. Take the pressure off. But now everything is worse. What are you saying? My friends are upset. I don't know what's going. To happen to our stories. Yeah, but... Hunter, I don't want anything bad to happen to us... to you. I think... I think we should break up. I'm sorry. Male narrator: And so as the sun set on Ever After High... Female narrator: The students. Were getting fairest. For the big dance. Meow! Ooh! Sparrow? I need you to help me ruin the True Hearts dance tonight. What? Why? Briar is planning it. And if I can get her in trouble. With Headmaster Grimm, Then there'll be a new opening in the royal ranks. You know what? I am done with you. What's ruffled your feathers? I, Sparrow Hood, the rockingest, handsomest guy in this school, Can't find out where the dance is. No one will tell me. 'cause I'm friends with you. Well, someone around here must know something. You really think anyone's going to tell you the truth? There's one person at this school who's cursed to. Raven, over here. Wow, Briar, you really know how to throw. The most "hexcellent" parties. I had some help. Ha ha! I, uh... ...appreciate your kind kudos, fair maiden. We got the daughter of the Pied Piper. Melody Piper?! What up, Ever After? Ready for me to drop some True Hearts tunes? All: Yay! Then follow me. This Next Chapter Day saw a 30% rise in our semimagical creature attendance... Duchess: Psst! Rates, which, when you compare that to... Psst! Excuse me. Duchess Swan, I'm addressing the entire magical community on the MirrorNet at this very moment. I know. And I'm so sorry to disturb you. But there's something I just thought you had to know about. Which is? I hate to tell on my friends, but some students are having a secret. True Hearts Day dance. Show me where. Ahh! So 300 autographs later, my quill finally gives out. But there are 100 more girls in line... Daring? Daring? Uh, can we talk for a minute? Of course, yes. I wanted to thank you. For that poem you left on my locker. Um, I never wrote you a poem. You didn't? But it says right here... "D. Charming." Dexter! Hi, Dex! So... not exactly a happy True Hearts Day, huh? Why does my brother always get the girl? It's not fair. Maybe you should stop thinking so much about your brother and, um, concentrate on someone else. Uh, who? You. You spend so much time comparing yourself to Daring, you forget you're great just the way you are. Really. Cross my heart. Thanks, Cupid. It was Dexter! Can you believe it? Dex, he's so sweet and cute. And I'm gonna tell him that I... I'm too late. Where is this party? Not much further. Give it up for Melody Piper! Now since True Hearts Day hasn't been "spellabrated" in such a long time, I wanted to tell everyone what it's all about. Once upon a time, there grew a very special tree... The Heart Tree. And even if the winter. Was harsh. And the other trees failed to bloom, the Heart Tree blossomed no matter what. And so our fairytale ancestors gave the blossoms to each other on True Hearts Day to show that even though it's not always easy, true love will always find a way. And so to encourage all of us to follow our true heart... Make sure to give yours to someone special to you. Can I... Hunter? When I listen to my true heart, it tells me that you're my Prince Charming. Aw! But how can you be a Royal and date Hunter? I don't know. But if writing our own happily ever after means I can't be a Royal, then call me Ashlynn Ella, the Rebel! I'd like to give this to you, Hunter, if you'll have it. Of course. Apple! I'm so sorry. I just had to do what... Why are you giving this. To me? I might be worried about you, and I might think. You're doing the wrong thing, But I want you to know that we'll always be friends, no matter what. That's what's in my true heart. Thanks, Apple. You're the best. I know. This is literally the best day ever. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Don't be a worry flurry. Let's party! Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine. Hmm. Hey, Cupid, have you seen Cedar? I can't find her anywhere. Oh, Cedar had something royally important to do tonight. There it is. Humph! Hyah! Dudes, trying to practice here. Miss Swan! Detention! What? Where are they? ♪ You totally got what you deserved! ♪ Yeah. Cerise: You told Cedar the wrong spot 'cause you knew Duchess. Would try to get it out of her. Yep. Then she left me a note back in the dorm telling me the real party. Was here. Male narrator: Now that is a happy ending. Female narrator: I have to say, My true heart agrees.
