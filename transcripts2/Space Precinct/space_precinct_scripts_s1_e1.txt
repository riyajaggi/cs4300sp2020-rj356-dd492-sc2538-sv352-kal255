 The name's Brogan... Lieutenant Brogan. For 20 years, I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now? Well, let's just say, I've "transferred" to another precinct. I'm telling you, Brogan. We're wasting our time. They're not comin'. They're not comin' tonight. They're not comin' ever. Our little buddy here has just been wasting our time. Say it ain't so, slik. No, Mr. Brogan, sir.

 What have we got, officer haldane? Well, let's see... I've got looks, I've got charm... The most annoying mannerisms of any man I've ever known. Punctured again, officer haldane... All right, all right. We've got four xyronites, block 27, zone 3. They just landed. Illegals? Yeah, check. You pick them up, we're gonna follow the courier. He's made us. Gotta go, love. Hey, Brogan! Let slik go, you promised! Later, pal! Watch... Hey-hey! Thanks, Brogan. Yeah, don't mention it, haldane. Brogan and haldane's informant came through. We've got a fix on four illegal immigrants. Let's hit it. Hey... Show off. Watch! Slik whole life just passed before his eyes. That's good... 'Cause there's no movie on this flight. You, stay here! Hey. You take the back. Why do I... I always get the back? Slik don't like being left. Slik got scared. Yeah, well, slik will be more than scared, if he does that, again. Brogan! Hey! Thanks, Jack. Yeah, it's all right, man. Are you okay? Yeah, I'll live. What about it? How do you tell with these things? He dead okay. It's enough to make you sick. That's funny. You like eating it in cruiser. Come on, come on, the contact! Who were your contacts? We have told you. The courier in the transit was the only one. No others. I don't accept that. Who set up the deal? Who did you pay? Payment was made by coded computer transfer. It's untraceable. What about him? Have you ever met him? How about him? Or him? No. Does the name tylan gershom sound familiar? Well? They're telling the truth... I think. You think? Tooky, I thought you could read xyronite minds. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine. Maybe you should take a break. Yeah. One more time. Who were your contacts? Hey, orrin! How'd you like tickets for the slam ball final, front row, center aisle, right on team grid? Dream on, beezle. They've been sold out for weeks. Who said anything about buying tickets? "Reach level 12 in the great slam ball bid game competition "and win two pair free." Forget it, we're lousy at computer games. But tooky is the opposite of lousy. Tooky has powers. Hey, tooky! Could you just... Hey! Took! Took, you okay? Keep your distance! Slomo, full body scan! What was took working on? She was interviewing some illegals gershom smuggled in. Xyronites? Yes, sir. My readings indicate xyron fever, captain. Thanks, slomo. Place her in full quarantine. Same goes for the xyronites... And immunize every officer in this station! I want gershom stopped before he spreads xyron fever across half the planet! I never thought I'd have to say this... But you two have let me down badly. I needed that courier alive, remember... So he could give evidence against gershom! I didn't intend to kill him, captain. I meant to disable him. Some disabling! You hit a vital organ! How was I supposed to know his brain was in his armpit? Isn't it about time you learned? Gershom's bringing sickness to altor and now I can't stop him, thanks to you two! Why you do this to slik, Mr. Gershom? What I ever do to you? Nothing, that's what. One of my best couriers is dead, slik. Not me. Slik have nothing to do with that. You were seen with an officer Brogan. Brogan? No, you make big mistake, for sure. Mr. Gershom doesn't make mistakes, slik. You like to drive, slik? For sure, slik like to drive. You like to drive this car? For sure. Anything you say, Mr. Gershom. How about you go for a little drive right now? You untie slik? I got no way to steer. For sure. For sure. No! Please? Mr. Gershom! All right. Well done. You have saved half your team. Prepare to enter level eight, if you dare! Matt... Dinner's ready! There you go, sweetie... Thank you, whoops! Watch that curve. Matt, Matt... Dinner! Later, mom... I'm doing homework! He's playing that slam ball thing, again. Matt, come in here now! Please? Thank you. What happened to your face? Nothing. Nothing? I walked into a cruiser door, okay? Nice one, dad. So... What are we having for dinner? Surprise. It's called sempter-squab. I-I think I'll pass on the meat. Liz, wanna give me your plate? I don't want any, either. It's fine. Then why isn't daddy having any? I'm trying to cut down on fats and stuff. Okay, well, at least eat your veggies. There's nothing wrong with 'em. Matt? Sure, I'll try anything... once. I'm glad somebody's gonna eat it. You, sure I can't get you any of this? No, I'm fine. Mom, dad! That thing, it screamed when I cut it. Don't be silly, veggies can't scream. It did. Eat! See? Great, talking vegetables. That's all I need. What's so funny? You are, zit-head. Look. Pretty neat? Listen... Let me see that. I haven't seen one of these things in years. Where'd you get it? Downtown. The guys at school know the best places. Downtown? Yeah, there's this awesome store in Ripley mall. I don't want you down there, Matt. What? You heard what I said. Dad, I'm 14... I know what I'm doing. You'll do what I tell you. Yeah, so you can quit that slam ball competition, 'cause he won't let you go. Will you, daddy? I don't need to take this. I'll do what I want. And you can forget dinner! Matt! Can't you just leave him... No, I know what it's like down there. It's, it's a whole new world. He just wants to explore it. Maybe if you spent a little time with him. Yeah, I know. Brogan, sorry to bother you. It's all right. What do you got? Your pal, slik? Dead. Gershom? He's the best bet. Okay, I'm coming in. Patrick! Honey, it's important. I gotta go. We got lucky! We have a witness saw gershom kill slik in the car park. Gave us a positive I.D. Will he testify? If we can keep him alive. Sergeant Fredo's bringing in gershom in now. We have a prelim at 6:00 tomorrow evening. Get ready for level three of the great slam ball competition. What exactly do you two think you're doing? A case of computer fraud, sir. Yeah. Vital data is encoded in this disc. We're trying to crack it, sir. I see. Well, keep up the good work, then. We'll do our best, sir. As I said, we have a hearing tomorrow at 6:00. I want you to give our witness round the clock security until then. Never leave his side. Understood? Understood... What's his name? His name is Armand loyster, business exec from metazoid one. He's... He's different. Two hits, three misses? Ever consider optical enhancement, castle? Ever consider keeping your opinions to yourself, haldane? Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's not an opinion... That's a fact. You missed the target more times than you hit it. You know, maybe I could recommend a course in remedial marksmanship under the tutelage of yours truly. Your partner depends on you. Wait, wait. Look, I'm sorry. I... I should've thought about took. Sometimes, I open my mouth and... The stupidest things come out. I've noticed. Hey... We got nursemaid duty. Who is it? Lieutenant Brogan and officer haldane, d.C.P.D. You have identification? Okay. Gentlemen... Thank you for coming. It's such a relief. Armand loyster. A pleasure to meet you, officer Brogan. The feeling is mutual, Mr. Loyster. Of course... Handshaking. I've heard of your human customs. Most eccentric. Yeah. And you must be officer... Haldane, sir. We're here to protect you. Outstanding! Please make yourselves at home. I hear you have instructions not to leave my side. How is she? Not well, I'm afraid. Fever's down, but... Her pulse is still unstable... And she's not responding to antio-therapy. Will she make it? With xyron fever, who knows? All we can do is wait and hope. Um... May I sit with her? Excuse me, Mr. Gershom. Can I have a few words with you? Come on, back off, guys. May I remind you, sergeant, that by law, you must release my client unless you can produce a witness within 24 hours. We got a witness. You'll meet him in court tomorrow. Court? This should never have gone to court. My client is an honest, law-abiding citizen. Well, then tell him to put the cigar out. It's no smoking in here. My apologies. Charming. I blame the parents. Yeah, they should've drowned him at birth. Hey, slomo, how's it going? Level eight already! I told you this was a great idea. Yes, yes, yes, yes... I feel good, feel good. Yes, yes, yes! I'm sorry, I must've dosed off. I couldn't sleep at all. Officer Brogan has been keeping me company. Yeah. We're having a hell of a game here. Jeez! That damn mosquito! Probably a swamp fly. A swamp fly, in the city? I seem to attract them. Don't worry... They're harmless. Yeah, to you maybe. There he is. You see him, up there? Yeah, let me get him. Don't bother. He's mine. Actually, they're quite delicious. I'm as sober as a judge! Lock him up! We'll handle the paperwork later. We gotta get on with our, other case. Take your hands off me. I can stand on my own. Level nine! Great work, slomo... Keep it up. We're nearly there. Come on, slomo! Hit level 12. Then it's hello, slam ball tickets. Come on, boy. Excellent. Come on. Keep on coming. Come on, slomo. Don't slow down, slomo... You're doing well. Come on. The charred remains of a human body were discovered in a car park last night. Tylan gershom, self-described entrepreneur, has been arrested in connection with the incident. Now, over to nantor with the latest slam ball results. Sorry, boys, I... I need to visit the flusher. Great. But I thought... Weren't you told never to leave my side? Tooky! Tooky. Show off. Hey, took's all right. Hey, guys... Took's come around! Dive left, slomo... Left! To the left, you tin-headed dummy! She's come around! Come on, slomo! Hit level 12 and it's home free. Excuse me... Will you both... Shut up, please? Thank you. Orrin, where's Brogan? He's with the witness. How do I reach him? I want to tell him about took. Took, what about took? She's come around, like I just said! Great, you ought to let Brogan and haldane know. They're at hotel nirvana, suite 302. Ooh, wee, ooh. Well, yes... We've done it! Yes! I wish to speak with my lawyer. Say "please?" Suite 302, hotel nirvana. He must not testify. No problem... And the two cops? We don't want any witnesses. You understand? Loud and clear. Want one? No. Thank you. How about Brogan? I think Brogan's busy. So, when will you be home? Not till the hearing. Come on, sal, I have to be there. Hi, daddy. Hi, honey, how's it going? Okay, I suppose. Where's your brother? Downtown. What? I told you not to tell him. To get his hair done the slam ball way, you know, like real weird. Thank you. Sal, I told him downtown is off limits. I know what it's like down there. Well, you only know the bad parts. That's all you ever see. Look, I don't want him going down there and that's final! Lock him in his room, if you have to. It's not a lock on his door he needs. It's a father who comes home once in a while. You know what to do. Stupid woman. Stupid kid. You have a family, officer? No. I love my family. Got four children. I can't bear to be away from them. Here, I got a picture of them somewhere. Aren't they beautiful? Yeah. The little one's just out of diapers. I gotta get some air. Come on, Brogan, we're out of here in ten minutes. Yeah, I'll be back in five. Credit limit exceeded. Please contact your credit bank. Move, move, it's a hit! A hit? I said move! Don't try it. Up against the wall. It's all right, guys. Looks like this just ain't your day. That's good, just do the little ones there. Hi, honey. Why don't you come over here and give me a kiss? Dad's full of it. It's fun downtown. Yeah-well, it's also dangerous. Dangerous? We live in a steel box that orbits a planet in space. What could be more dangerous than that? Matt... Can I call charla, mom? Sure, honey. Matt, please, stay away from downtown. I mean, at least until your father's cooled off. Fat chance, he never gets off my case. Mom, mom! It's simple, see? No cops, no witnesses, no trial. Easy. Dad! Patrick... What the hell is going on there? Are you all right? I'm fine, honey, I gotta go. I love you. Come on, let's go, let's go. God... You are never, ever going downtown again. Get him in there. Get in, come on, come on! Go, go, go! Come on, come on! Jack, Jack! You okay? F-F-Fine. Communications are out. Terrific. We're on our own. Brogan's wife saw it all on the screen, sir. She says they left the hotel. They must be on their way. Damned! Find them! Hey, loyster, when this is over, just think what you can tell your kids. Yes. "Don't ever help the police." Time to head to court, Mr. Gershom. This is a complete waste of time. I intend to file an official complaint. Good idea, you do that. Don't worry. Everything's under control. It better be. Move it. Come on, Brogan. Can't you get any more out of this bucket? No, he clipped our stabilizers. 150 is the best we can do. What the hell is that? Whatever it is, it ain't friendly. Man, I don't believe this. Come on, Brogan. Brogan, we're locked onto that tower. Yeah, game's over. Lower my window. What? Lower it! Now what? Come on, loyster. Come on, you can do it! Yes! Loyster... Loyster, come on. Loyster, my friend, that was great tongue work. Hey, loyster. Loyster, you all right? Loyster? No, not now, loyster! Get him the mask, get him the mask! Come on! Come on, loyster, come on. Jack, Jack, take the controls. Take the controls. Come on! How do you know you're pumping his heart? I don't. Good question. Brogan, that's beyond the call of duty. Captain podly... You may escort your witness, Mr. Armand loyster, to the stand. See if you can find out what's going on. Your honor... If I might ask that the court would wait but a few moments longer, I'm sure that... Captain, the law is quite clear. If prosecution cannot present satisfactory evidence within the required period, no charges may be upheld. Yes, sir, I know, but I'm sure Mr. Loyster will be here any minute now. D.c.p.d. Beezle, any word from Brogan and haldane? We're running out of time here. Negative. I can't believe this. Tylan gershom is just going to walk free because Brogan and haldane can't produce our star witness. Hold it. Something's just come in. I demand that all charges be dropped and that my client be released immediately. I'm sorry, captain. The court will rise. Your honor. Our witness, Armand loyster, is receiving emergency medical treatment. I object! This is nothing but a delaying tactic. However, if it pleases the court, Mr. Loyster wishes to make a statement via satellite. The court would be most willing, officer castle. Mr. Loyster... If you see the person who killed slik ostrasky, please point them out. He did it! He did it! He killed that poor human. He was the one! Sergeant Fredo! I will not have fighting in my court! Order! Take him down. Gotcha. Take him down! Order! Well done. Well done. How about a rematch, officer haldane? Why, sure. Why don't you just mosey on up here, little lady, and plink away at that little target? Would you think any less of me if... I just conceded? I don't see how I could possibly think less of you than I already do. Hey! I hear took's gonna make a full recovery. Yes, she will. Great. So, what do you say you and I get a drink and celebrate? No, not tonight... But, um... Maybe some other time. All right? Gotcha. I hear we nailed gershom, sir. Indeed, we did. He's looking at a life sentence. By the way... How is that case of yours doing? Sir? The computer fraud case. The one you've been working on for the last two days. What have you got for me? Well, loads of data, sir. Yeah, loads of it. Figures... Figures... Numbers... Yeah. Tons of... Stuff. Pity. I was hoping for tickets for the slam ball final. That, too, sir. Good! Actually... There's someone else who'd appreciate them a great deal more than me. No! I am so glad you're home.
