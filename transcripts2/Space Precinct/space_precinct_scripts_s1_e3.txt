 The name's Brogan. Lieutenant Brogan. For 20 years, I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now... well, let's just say, I've "transferred" to another precinct. Nothin' like a father-son adventure. Doing what men have done since the dawn of time: Getting away from women... Heading off on their own. To see an asteroid... How exciting. Dad, if I wanted to see a ball of ice, I could've gone to the fridge. Look, Merlin's asteroid only comes close to altor once every 20 years. Trust me. It's really something up close.

 So you go into hoc to beef up the hopper, so we can make the jump? Well, what else is money for? I don't know. Maybe, someday, I could see some. Yeah. Well, try lookin' at that. Still wanna go back to the fridge? All right... let's head in for a closer look. Dad? Dad, what's happening? I don't know. Try switchin' to manual. You knew the hopper was gonna go screwy. Well, the berkoff radiation surrounding the asteroid disrupts computer functions. You could warn a guy.

 What, spoil our fun? Okay, let's take a look at the side you can't see from altor. Smooth as space. Who needs an auto-pilot? I guess they did. Come in, unidentified ship. Repeat, do you copy? I told you. It's a wreck. Come on, dad, the bay doors are open. Let's go take a look. I don't think that's such a hot idea, Matt. But we came all this way. It'll be fun. Okay. All right! What do ya know? We got air. Okay, Matt, you stay here while I check this out. Dad! Dad. Matt, we play by my rules, or we don't play. Hey! Easy, dad! I thought I told you to stay put. I, um, I have some questions on those rules. Matt, get back to the hopper. Throttle down, dad. This isn't a crime scene. It's just an old ship that's been here, since the dawn of time. All right, but don't touch anything. All right. Okay, what do we got here? Man. We got enough stored energy here for a round trip to earth. Think your mother'd mind? Nah. Come on! Come on! You're okay, you're okay! I'll never disobey again, I promise. I promise! Well, your mom's gonna be glad to hear that. I mean, it's not like I've never seen a dead body before. I've seen lots... On TV. Don't touch it! It's all right, Matt. He's dead. He's been dead a long time. So what do we do? Well, I don't know. I guess we oughta see if there's any way we can fire up this ship and get it back to altor. All right, dad! Taking off's one thing. You think you can land it? Well, that's okay, Matt. As soon as we get out of this radiation field, we'll call for assistance. It looks like a homicide. Blaster burn on the chest. No sign of a gun anywhere. Can we ID him? The face is pretty well decomposed. That's an understatement. Yeah, the old ones are always a bear to solve. Yeah, well, hopefully we can pass this one on. Traffic's sending out a pilot to meet us. They'll probably roll it straight over to forensics. Hey, dad, get a load of this. H.i.? Humes interspace. Well, what do ya know? We're on board a humes interspace prototype number sk90. Better give 'em a call... See what they got to say. Yeah, you got it. Later. Humes interspace. Maybe you should try calling Alden humes himself. Yeah, he takes a lot of calls from street cops. He hasn't always been a recluse, you know. Once upon a time, he used to be a playboy jet-setter, darling of the tabloids. Totally irresistible to women? Yeah, I guess we do have a lot in common. In your dreams, haldane. These specks look great. Tell the crew, "good work," and, take them all out for a big dinner... On me. Thank you, sir. Hang on a minute. Yes, Linda? There's an officer haldane calling. He wants to speak with Mr. Humes. Pipe him through. Hello, officer, I'm dag jomore, Mr. Humes' right hand. What can I do for you? We found one of your ships on Merlin's asteroid. We thought somebody there might know something about it. Really, officer, do you have any idea how many ships humes interspace has manufactured? We supply every sentient race in the galaxy. Well, this is one of your prototypes, sk90. Well, that is a different matter. Yes, we'd have a record of that. I'll look into it. You might want to look into one other thing. We found a body on board. I'm, I'm not sure I follow what you're saying, officer. Was it one of our employees or something? Well, it was one of your prototypes. We thought maybe somebody there could shed some light on it. Well... Naturally, I'll help any way I can. Thanks. We'll get back to you. Incredible. Should we inform Mr. Humes? Well, he's not gonna like it. Bad publicity for the company. I'll tell him. Man, wouldn't you love to see anansi's face if I cruised by school in this baby? Well, if nobody claims it after 60 days. What's that? I don't know. Some kind of signal comin' in, but I can't unscramble it. Must have the wrong number. Warning! Warning! This ship will auto-destruct in t minus 60 seconds and counting! 59... 58... 55... 54... 53... 52... Computer, override! Computer, override self-destruct! 51... 50... Computer! Matt, get to the hopper! Dad... Do it! 49... 48... 47... 46... The door won't open! Come here. Come here! 44... 43... 42... 41... 40... Go, go, go! Come on, Matt, move it! 36... 35... 34... 33... Get back, Matt. Come here. 32... 31... 30... 29... 28... 27... 26... 25... Matt, get back! 22... 21... 20... Go, go! 19... 18... 17... 16... Go! 15... 14... 13... 12... 11... 10... 9... 8... 7... Go, dad, go! 3... It's okay. We're okay. No ship. No body. Great. Yeah, well, physical evidence tends to be overrated. Yeah, well, somebody didn't think so. The signal that triggered the auto-destruct was no accident. All right, recording. Now, Matt, I want you to remember everything. I just saw what my dad saw. I know, but I want to hear it in your own words. You ever been shot? Once or twice. Let me see the scars. Um... Maybe later. First I have to make a report on everything you saw on that ship. You know, whoever did this, I'm gonna nail him to the wall. Yeah, but first you gotta have a case. All right. All right, step one... Who knew you found the ship? It had to be you, haldane. You never did like me. Don't give me any ideas. And you say you clawed the body away when it fell on you? Yeah, I was freaked. I had to get the horrid body off me. Brogan, we may have something. Matt, have you washed your hands since you touched that body? No. I guess I should've. No, you shouldn't. Hold still, please. You must hold still. Matt told me he clawed at the dead man's face. I'm hoping that some of the DNA's still there. Yes! What does that mean? It means that when you pushed him away, some of the skin from his face got under your nails. Whoever blew up the ship didn't destroy all the evidence. You mean I've been walkin' around with pieces of a dead guy? Every cell has a template of the entire body. We can run a DNA sequence of the sample and get some idea of what the guy might have looked like. How long will that take? About five or six hours... Say 9:00, tonight. Okay, I'm gonna drop you off at home, pal, and, you and I are gonna go visiting. 120th floor. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'm your humes interspace elevator. If you'd like to have a conversation or listen to music, please state a selection. How 'bout silence? Excellent choice, sir. Samuel Johnson said, "silence propagates itself, "and the longer talk has been suspended, "the more difficult it is to find anything to say." While George Elliot said, "speech may be barren..." Talked to death by an elevator. Next time, music. Officer haldane. And you are? Brogan. Yes. You were on the ship. Officer haldane told me what happened. Please, come this way. You were right. The sk90 was one of our ships, a prototype for deep space missions. It was launched 20 years ago. We were supposed to recover it soon after to study its data, but we lost its signal, assumed that it had gone off course, drifted out of the core systems. Who was the pilot? It had none. It was on auto-program. Did you tell anybody about the discovery? Other than my assistant, no. I don't think so. Did you tell your boss? Mr. Humes? Yes, yes, I did. Then we're gonna need to speak to him. No, not possible. He's a very private man. Look, pal, whoever did this didn't just try to kill me, they tried to kill my son. Now we can do this easy, or we can do it hard. I'll ask if he'll see you. Thank you. Well, I think you just blew any chance for employment at this company. Mr. Humes. Whoever killed our John Doe most likely cut the ship's signal so it'd never be found, but they didn't count on the asteroid to bring it back to altor. So why didn't they just send an auto-destruct signal 20 years ago? Well, they probably did, but the berkoff radiation shut down the ship's computer before the signal got through. Okay. Until Matt and I manually flew the sk90 out of the asteroid's radiation field, it couldn't see the code. Right. Gentlemen. Lieutenant Brogan and officer haldane. This is a pleasure. Sorry, but I never shake hands. That way I avoid getting your germs and you mine. I believe it keeps old age at bay. Well, I'm gonna have to give that a try. You look great for a guy pushin' 60. How long you been doin' that? You know, I... I don't remember. Please, um, gentlemen, sit down. Jomore, refreshments. Nothing for me. I'm on duty. It's just cave mountain water, lieutenant. It's nothing intoxicating or poisonous. Come now, gentlemen, we wouldn't be having this conversation unless you suspected me of some terrible crime. But I was horrified to learn of the narrow escape you and your son had. For someone to try to destroy one's family. I... I always wanted a family, but... Somehow, I never had one. Seems as though it's been nothing but business for years... Years. What would you like to know? Did you send the signal to destroy the sk90 or order it to be sent? Mr. Humes! It's all right, jomore. No. Did you kill the man onboard the ship? I've never killed anybody. Did you know who he was? No. And i'm sincerely sorry that all of your evidence was obliterated. Well, luckily for us, it wasn't. Our forensics team has a DNA sample that's gonna give us a picture of the victim's face within the next few hours. That's remarkable what science is capable of. Isn't it, jomore? Yes, sir. Yes. Is there anything else? No, that'll do it, but we'll get back to you if there is. Yes, of course. Any time, gentlemen. Jomore, show them to the elevator. We know the way. Now that we've bated the hook, let's get back to the station and see if we get a bite. Now, here's what I want you to do. You ever been shot? Once or twice. Let me see the scars. Um... maybe later. What are you doing, haldane? Just thinking. Thinking? I'm shocked. You're shocked? Don't be redundant. Seriously, castle. Earlier when you were talkin' to Matt, questioning him, you mentioned bullet wounds... Was that one or two? That's none of your business! You show me yours... I can't believe you met Alden humes! Orbital, dad! What'd he say? He said he'd like to have a family. Where do I go to sign up? Hi. Hey. Are you hung up at work? Yeah, something came up. Who would've guessed? Say, dad, think you could front me five credits for new slamball wheels? I'm a little short this month. It's okay. I'll just drag the gutters for loose change. We've instilled some fine values in that boy. Yeah, well, he takes after his father, don't you think? Anyway, listen, I'm on early shift tonight. Liz is at charla's, and, you and Matt'll just have to fend for yourselves. No problem. Okay. Alert! Alert! Fire in the medical room! Alert! Alert! Fire in the medical room! Over there! Here! Where'd he go? Where'd who go? Humes, he was right there! Well, there's nobody here now. And nobody could've got past me. Well, then how'd he get outta here? I'm telling you what I saw. So we're in there in breathers and this guy is... Standin' there like he didn't have to breathe. Do you know what you're sayin'? Yeah, I know what it sounds like, but I know what I saw. Lieutenant, we've managed to save the sample. We're now ready to make a rendering of the victim's face. Boy, now i'm startin' to see it. Make it three. So if the body that was found on the ship was Alden humes, who the hell did we meet this afternoon? Like the man says, "it's remarkable what science is capable of these days." You work long hours, gentlemen. Seems you do, as well. You have a question for me? Yeah. What'd you have for breakfast? Lieutenant Brogan, this is ridiculous! It's a simple question. What'd ya have? Well... What'd ya eat yesterday or the day before, or for the last 20 years? It's so odd, I... I can't recall. What have you done over the last 20 years, except work? Tell me about one friend, one conversation. Have you ever been to a slamball game, walked in the rain? I simply can't explain this. No, but I think I can. Jomore, what is the meaning of this? It means you're a projection, a computer simulation of the real Alden humes. No, no, it... It can't be true. You killed humes all those years ago, then you hid his body on the spacecraft, but you didn't count on the asteroid bringin' it back to haunt you. Alden humes is an eccentric. Everyone knows it. He programmed the simulation himself and is living a reclusive life on danai. That's your story? It's as good as yours. I just... I don't understand what's happening. Jomore, who am I? You're all that Alden humes was and knew. Jomore needed that expertise to run the company, keep it on the cutting edge... And do other errands. You don't remember starting the fire in our medical room, do you? No. Jomore programmed you to do that and then, uploaded you into the station system. You're nothing but his slave. Whatever the relationship between myself and my employer, I don't have to listen to any more of this. I'm asking you to leave. Let's go, haldane. Um... Once word gets out there's no humes, what do ya think's gonna happen to this company's stock? See ya on the late show, boys. Well, that oughta make 'em sweat. Yeah, in the meantime, we make a case against them that sticks like a valerian blue dog. Ground floor. Good evening, gentlemen. I'm your humes interspace elevator. If you'd like a... Music! Certainly, sir. What would you like to hear? How 'bout sweet mystery? You did what they said, jomore. Don't deny it... Just tell me why. Alden, I think you need to rest. No, jomore! You've known me for years. I'm a forgiving soul. Why? You were running the business into the ground with your partying, your wild times. What was I supposed to do? There were alternatives. You needed to be controlled. You didn't have to kill me! You turned me into this! You tore me from my life... From what I might've had! Ground floor! Ground floor! Good evening. I'm your humes interspace elevator. Shut up! What would you like to hear, jomore? How 'bout the funeral march? Humes, we can work this out! Yes, that's just what I'm doing. By the way, you're fired! No! No! No! No! I'm free. Free! Guess the bottom sort of dropped out of jomore's life. Maintenance says the elevator was serviced yesterday, but you don't think this was just a malfunction? No. Humes did this. Humes is dead. He's been dead for 20 years. A computer program did this. I've run diagnostics on every computer in this place. If there was a simulation of Alden humes, he ain't here now. Well, he's on the loose, and we don't know where. You had a break lately, Brogan? I'm okay. Go home, lieutenant. Get some rest. Matt? We're in here, dad. Hey, how ya doin'? Lieutenant Brogan, I was just telling Matt how much I owed his father. He wants me to make a list of everything I've ever wanted! Orbital, dad? Go to the hopper, Matt. Why? Where are we going? Do what I say. Go on, Matt. We'll be seeing a lot of each other. Sometimes, you can be massively mental. Nice kid. How'd you get here? With the proper programming, I can appear anywhere. And, lieutenant, I can program anything. Let's not talk of trifles. You liberated me, and I'm grateful. All the things I've... I've longed for, I can now have... Friends... A family. I'd like to be part of your family. You killed jomore, didn't you? No, no, he killed himself when he disposed of my organic form 20 years ago. I merely dispensed justice, and that's just the beginning. Do... do you have any enemies, lieutenant, some criminals you can't convict? 'Cause I can seek them out, delete them. You're gonna have to start with me. Please, there's no need for that. Anyway, we both know it would have no effect. I'm as insubstantial as... As a cloud. I'm... I'm invulnerable. I'm immortal. I'm... I'm god. You're not god! You're not even Alden humes. You're some out of control computer image. I was wrong about you. Both you and... and jomore, you wanna put me in a cage... Like frightened little men. And I thought you had more humanity, more imagination. Don't worry, lieutenant... I'll look after Matt. Forgive the sudden appearance, Matthew. I neglected to tell you, I'm somewhat more than meets the eye. Let's talk as we drive, shall we? Where's my dad? Matt. No. Haldane! Yeah, Brogan? Get over here! Humes has Matt! What? Unfortunately, your father couldn't be with us, Matthew. You see, he's... He's not like you and I. No, he... he doesn't have our sense of adventure. They've had one hell of a head start. Damn! I should've seen it comin'! Got it! You can be rich, have anything you desire. What if I just wanna go home? You don't wanna disappoint me, Matthew. See, I... I haven't been dealing very well with disappointments. Humes, come in! You talk to me! Dad! Matt! Matt, are you all right? Excuse me. Go home, Brogan. No! Give me my son! This is your doing! Dad! We're through with him now, Matthew. But my dad! He knocked out our servos. Get me something! Anything! Secondaries are responding. Come on! Come on! We belong only to each other. Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just you and me. We can go anywhere, do anything. Tell me about something you've always wanted to do, some dream. You know, I never did get a good look at that asteroid. Well, that got the old heart started. Where are they goin'? He's headed towards the asteroid. Smart, Matt. Very smart. It's... It's truly spectacular. Yeah. Can't wait to get closer? Yeah. What's... what's happening to me? It's working. The asteroid's radiation is shuttin' him down. I'm losing control. Slamball done! Matt, can you get control of the ship? I won't let you. No, dad! They're goin' in. Matt, activate the passenger escape system. How do I do that? Open the ejector panel and press the release button. Come on, hurry! It won't open. It... it's stuck. Pull, Matt! Pull hard! It won't open! Go. Go home, Matt. All right, he's okay. Yeah, he's safe. Hang on, Matt. We're comin' to get ya. Man, that's one ice cube I'll never forget. Yeah, that's kinda funny to think that's humes' graveyard, not once but twice. It's a brave thing you did by goin' up there. Yeah, well, when in doubt, think. Who said that? Gee, dad, I just did. So you did. You know that stuff I wanted... When he asked me, all I really wanted was to be here. Come here, kid. You know, I wonder how much it'd cost to keep mom from finding out what happened. Can't blame a guy for tryin'. Sleep well, Matt, with no bad dreams, while others walk alone.
