 The name's Brogan, lieutenant Brogan. For 20 years, I was with the n.Y.P.D. Now, well, let's just say, I've "transferred" to another precinct. We've scored big this time, babe! That old tarn junk dealer bought every rsa unit I had. Another couple of deals like this, and it's nuhuwaii, here we come. Skeevan, that's marvelous! I'll stow my tools and be home before you can say, "rub some moon screen on my back." Shouldn't be out this late, Mr. S.

 No telling who might Rob you. How about you hydras ease up a little? It's the fourth time this month. Well, we could make it the last. Excuse me. I, wonder if you know what time it is. Yeah. It's time you took a hike! Well, we don't think so. We don't think so at all. Do we? I can never remember how fast a human heart beats. A hundred beats a minute? Two?

 Three? Maybe not. I'm sorry, but I don't know what time it is, either. You don't have to, friend. I'll tell you. It's time skall street had a protector. Seventy three-five, code six. Some neighborhoods are like a dying uncle. They just look worse and worse. Captain, we ID'd our friend here as one Nick Roberts, 23, young punk that used to run with the hydra gang. Yeah, not the kind to sit at home knittin' shawls for grandma. So, what punched his ticket? Any visible wound... Signs of drugs? Preliminary scan indicates cause of death was a heart attack. Heart attack? At 23? That's one hell of a fatty diet. Scan suggests that, it was some kind of violent trauma to the heart, but we're not gonna know for sure until we get an autopsy report. Well, get the team onto it. Hydras run skall street. Lots of rival gangs would like to move in on them. I got a feeling this fella didn't blow out while jogging. I know this street. It's got eyes and ears. Fan out... Get me something! Home sweet home. You sit right there, sweetheart, and I'll rustle us up some grub. Replicate food for two. It's no banquet but, it'll chew. Been in lots of places like this. But this time, it's gonna be different. Have you ever seen a snowball? It starts real small, but once it gets rolling, it grows and grows. We've made a good start here. I, I talked to your parents, vala. They're on a nice, green planet, rolling hills, big house, with a room just for you. I know. You miss them. But you'll be with 'em soon, I promise. But you remember what I told you... It's hard to reach them. It's gonna take money, lots of money. So... So you've gotta help me. Autopsy report on Nick Roberts. You're gonna love this. Turns out his heart literally exploded. Offhand, I can't think of any natural cause that could do that. Yeah, unless he had one hell of a spicy meal. Anything in the system? Drugs demolition germs? All we know, right now, is someone unknown external factor seems to have caused it. Lieutenant, your wife. Excuse me. You know, you ask me, I think it was a woman. All the ones I've known have been heartbreakers. Why, haldane, you surprise me. I never knew you had a heart. Lieutenant, we got that human you wanted to question. Good honey, I gotta go. Look, don't worry about Liz and Matt. Thanks. Okay, bye-bye. Haldane! You're gonna wanna be in on this. Andy sturgeon, leader of the hydra gang. Figured he might know something about his dead little club member, so I had him yanked off the street. Suspicion of mayhem suspicion of murder. Yeah, the only thing he's not suspected of is taste. You can't just bring me in off the streets, man. I got rights, too, you know! I wanna launch a complaint. I had an appointment with my accountant. Well, your friend Nick's got an appointment with the undertaker. Yeah, a shame about that, isn't it? Who'd have figured he had a bum ticker? You know, his ticker was fine until somebody blew it up. What are you talking about? His heart was shredded like he'd swallowed a blender. What could do that? We figured maybe you'd know. Microwave weapons can fry somebody's insides. Know anybody who might've adapted one to do somethin' like this? No. Anybody who might've wanted to whack him? Yeah, about a billion, but I don't know anyone who'd have the guts to. Well, maybe he's got a new dance partner. Maybe. You sure like tight places. I haven't been in here since I was a kid. You were a nice kid, Andy, until the street got you. It didn't get me. I got it. I own the street. The street owns you. You trying to reform me, skeevan? Only thing needs reforming is the bug that ripped out Nicky's heart, right back of your store! I don't know nothin'! No? Well, maybe this will jog your memory. Ii tell you I didn't see a thing! No please! I quite like that, emblem of yours, a two headed dragon. Ha! Like you and your dead pal. Two heads without a single thought. There's a condition called "empathy." It's where you can feel the pain in others, but you can't feel anything. You won't get... Okay, he gets the message. Enough enough! Make him stop it. Please, make him stop it! Go on get out of here. And don't come back! That's twice now. How can I thank you? Here, please... No. I couldn't, really. Please, let me do something. You haven't even told me your name. Trask. And, this here is vala. Well, vala... This is for you. She's a quiet one. So, we've been shakin' skall street 'til it rattles. Nobody's talkin'. Yeah, there's more. Since Nicky's little coronary, there have been no crimes reported. No disturbance of any kind. When skall street's quiet, it's bad quiet. I should know. I was born there. You fellas are from New York. You don't know really bad neighborhoods. There was a feller on the street when I grew up, skeevan. One time, I wrecked a cruiser i'd, borrowed. He fixed it up. Talked the owner into not pressing charges. Then, he set about fixing me. He persuaded me I could make something of my life. So, you became a cop. Yeah, only I found out that reality takes a hammer to your dreams and busts the hell out of them. Nice of the old creon to give you that. I've got a feeling he's gonna be very generous. What? You can run, Tom, but you can't hide. All right, then. How is this for empathy? Seventeen o-one in progress. Gunshots fired, 1100 block of skall street. Right. We're on it. Wait! Where the hell do you think you're going? Get back in there. Avi? Fred! Willow! You killed them! You killed my boys. All right all right! You want the street? You can have it. Anything, it's yours. It's over! Come on, sweetheart. So, if deja vu is when you get the feeling something's happening again, what do you call it when it happens four times? Don't tell me! Same as with Nick, massive heart problems. Right. Will you fellas finish off here? Where are you going? To find some answers! You have to reach down someone's throat and pull! Hello, skeevan. It's been a long time, podly, since before third shedding. We can wax nostalgic later. Right now, I have five stiffs, with no one putting a claim in. Five? Somebody decided to make the hydras extinct. And I figured, if anyone knows what goes down on this street, it's you. Leave it alone. No one will miss them. That's not the point. It's murder! Or maybe it's balance for all the life they bled out of the street. But then, you weren't around to see that. Bet you've got a nice place in the suburbs. Yeah, I do! Do you think I should feel guilty for that? My wife and kids can walk out the door without having to worry that some crystal head is gonna drop a brick on them or stick a glow ship up their spine! All right. Maybe when I got out, I didn't want to look back. You didn't protect your own, podly. What did you want me to do? Just wave my arms and sweep the street clean of everything that makes life around here a nightmare? It doesn't work like that. Maybe not for you. Tell me what you know. I gotta close up. There's a meeting down the street. What kind of meeting? One for people that live here. My good, new friends, there is a tide sweeping the cosmos, swallowing neighborhoods, countries, whole worlds... The tide of violence. Now, I'm happy to have been part of pushing that tide back. Yeah! But sadly, like all tides, it both ebbs and flows. You'll need a lifeguard to stand vigilant for its return. Yeah. Yeah. Now, some of you, I'm sure, would be willing to, pay for that service. No pay, no play. That's our motto. Isn't that right, girls? I should say so. Well put. Yeah. Times have been tough, but I can change that, if that's what you want. Yeah. Yeah. And all I'm asking for is half of what you earn. Half? You're kidding! Yeah, but we couldn't make enough to keep going. It's impossible. Just think of it as an investment in your personal safety. Why you... no, skeevan! Skeevan, no. We'll do, what you ask. Fine. I'll leave you to work out the details. You just bought yourselves a haven. This is crazy! We can't do it! We have to. We have no choice. He called us his friends! Sometimes, it's good to know who your real friends are. Excuse me. Skeevan! Podly, he'll know what to do. I'm looking for captain podly. He's not here, right now. I'm lieutenant Brogan. Where has he gone? It's urgent! Um, I'm sorry I don't know. But if you'll tell me, I'll... No... no. I might be heard. It's about skall street. So, tell us where and when. Look, I know this is difficult for you. But the sooner you can talk to us, the sooner we can get you some protection. Protection? Waterfront, by the antigraph processor, half an hour. You got it. You know, Brogan, I think I have spent more time in cop cars, waiting for somebody, than I have spent eating or bathing or in bed. Yeah, but I'll bet it's been a lot more rewarding experience. Yeah, well, speak for yourself. Now, vala. I... I know he gave you that, when he was pretending to be nice. But he wants to stop us from getting to your folks, so we have to stop him, if you wanna see them, again. What the hell is he doing? Do you really wanna wait to find out? That's my girl. I love this job. There is no way skeevan would ever have tried to kill two cops. So, the perps got to him before he could do his civic duty. They knew he was one of the good guys. Wish I'd had the chance to tell him that I knew it, too. We were going on vacation, our first ever. But somebody stopped him because he wanted to cue me in on what's been going down around here. There's a stranger in the neighborhood. We can't talk to you. Okay, that's your choice. Only, the last time I saw skeevan, he tried to tell me something. You can run, close your eyes, try to stay safe. But in the end, you have to turn back and make a stand. Now, you can let this go on, hand the fear down to your kids and their kids, or we can stop it. Number 13. That's where trask lives. Freeze! Close it. You're outnumbered. Someone take this, and I'll put up my hands. Check his place out. Haldane. It's okay. Nobody's gonna hurt you. Quite a place you have, floating above it all in stationary calm. We're not here to talk about real estate. The subject on the table is murder. Yeah, just like stone's. I never saw anything like it. What, are you telling me you didn't cause it? I've been telling you. There's nothin' special about me. Hey, you wanna see what I can do with my finely honed tarn mind? There, that's the entire show. I didn't give anyone a heart attack, not with my mind. He's holding something back, but what he's saying is the truth. So, what's the story on the little girl? I've never seen an alien like her. She got, separated from her folks during an ion storm. I found her escape pod. You know where they are? Haven't the slightest. You never tried to find them? Nope, never even heard from them. But, I've been looking after the girl. Saint trask? Yeah, I do what I can. Is there anything you'd like to tell me about Mr. Trask, maybe? Right back. So, what's the word? There are no words that's the problem. Maybe she's traumatized. I don't know. Could be anything. So, what's gonna happen to her now? Juvenile hall, if no one claims her. I hate to think of her in that awful place. Well, slomo ran her through records. So far, there's nothing. She doesn't belong to trask. That's for certain. She resembles a race on one of the rim worlds, but we don't know that much about them. It's gonna take some digging. Well, we can't hold him. Anybody who saw anything is dead. Except possibly the little girl, and she won't say anything. Well, as one would say, lovely. Listen to me, you piece of sludge! I'm from skall street. That's right. It was my pond you messed in! I have friends on several worlds, and I'm going to make it my hobby to see that, wherever you go, cops will be breathing down your neck! That's how you want it? That's how it is! All right, then. You're free to go. Tail him. You don't wanna do this, Sally. When Jane told me about that poor little girl, I... I'm telling ya. You don't wanna do it. Really? So, what do you wanna do then, Brogan? Send her to juvie hall? No, but... No, but what? Say something. Set another place at dinner. Now, I'm not sure what you're used to, vala. But why don't you just try a little bit of that, and we'll see what you like? Okay, sweetheart? You'd have eaten better at juvie. Don't mind him he's 14. You might learn a thing or two from vala, like how not to talk. Don't let him fool you, vala. He adores his baby sister. I'm eating, mom. Patrick: Yeah, right. So, let's not mention the time you came home with a bruise the size of a horde's eggs because some kid had made a crack about Liz you didn't like. Hey, I was little. Besides, my brain hadn't fully developed. You'd do the same tomorrow. The Brogan men are knights in shining armor. They just don't like to admit it. Okay, everybody go ahead and eat. Azul says howdy. She says you can go and pet her. I hope you sleep well. I'll be there in a minute. Okay. You warm enough? Good. Hey, I know that. When I was a kid, if there was a storm, my mother would sing it to me so I'd feel safe. Look, I know you're feeling really far from home, but we're gonna get you back there real soon. In the meantime, we're glad you're here. Sleep tight. He's been talking to my mom and daddy. Who has? Mr. Trask. They'll be getting all ready for us, Mr. Trask says. Tell me about it. They got lost from me. But they're safe now on a nice planet. I'm going there, soon as we get enough money. How are you gonna get it? From the people we protect. You get some sleep. We'll talk later. Haldane, I want you to reel trask back in. He flew the Coop, Brogan. What? Yeah, Fredo lost him at the space port. We think that he hopped a freighter out of the system. Great. We've been trying to raise them, but there's been sun spot interference. Well, call me when you get through. Yeah. I thought you'd jumped the planet. Nope. I've got some, business to finish. Evening, honey bunch. Time to go. Trask! Drop him, vala. I don't want to! Very nice. You've got her to talk. Vala. No! No! Stop it! No! Hahahaha! Good girl. Now, let me get this straight. You want to turn yourself in. Let's call it protective custody. In exchange for which? I'll tell you who really killed those hydras. Well, why don't you just tell me now? Not until I'm safely at the station, or we just could... Well, okay. It's a deal. The docking bay will stand ready. I'll be there. I'm the only one who cares, vala. The rest of them just want it so you'll never get home. Patrick! Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. She pulled her punch. Who... who did? Vala. Trask isn't the one with the power. Come in to bay six. Hands on the hopper horn and spread 'em! Don't move! Now, vala! Well, captain, who's breathing down whose neck now? Vala! How'd you like to see a control room? Initiate emergency thrusters. What? The thrusters, fire them. And send the station out of orbit? It'll tear itself to pieces. Yes, indeed. So, what's the deal? You go out in a Blaze of glory? No. Vala and I escape in a hopper, while the rest of you become molecules in altor's atmosphere. Ha! You must be crazy, if you think I'd lift a finger to do that! You don't have to. Drop him. Need palm print verification. Podly, captain, d.C.P.D. You got it. No! Verified. The door won't open! It's jammed! Haldane! What the hell is going on? We don't know. The station computer is registering a siege situation. It is sealing all doors and firing emergency thrusters. Can you override these locks? Negative. Ease up on him, darling. I want you to see this. Trask, don't do this. You got nothin' to trade, podly. I get skall street, damana city, too, while you and your station will be dust and memories. We put out a distress call, but we're running out of time. What are we talking about here? We're talking about five minutes, we're gonna be deep fried. No look! I'll punch it up in control five. Podly's down. Trask and your little friend are running the show. Can you get to 'em? Negative. They've locked the door and swallowed the key. Jane, punch up the schematics for all the emergency airlocks. I'm on it. Slomo? Okay, hold it hold it. Zoom in on that middle part. Bingo! Emergency airlock four at the back of the bays. It leads to a shaft right by the control room. Yeah, we see it. It's on a separate circuit. Jane, blow the bolts I'm coming in. Brogan, how ya doin'? Yeah, great. Real glad I didn't have that extra helping of ice cream. Yeah, I hear ya. Listen, haldane. There's a video I want you to cue up, okay? We'll be leaving you now. Trask! You don't have time for this, trask. You gotta make your getaway. Get vala back to her parents. Isn't that right? In time, yes. He's lying to you, vala. He's not gonna do it. Vala, honey, you've gotta trust me. I'm your friend. Don't believe him. He'd say anything, at this point. That's right, honey just listen to trask. Now, haldane! So, what's the story on the little girl? I've never seen an alien like her. She got, separated from her folks during an ion storm. I found her escape pod. You know where they are? Haven't the slightest. You never tried to find them? Nope, never even heard from them. Ha! Weasel your way out of that one. No! No, vala it's not true. Yes. Yes. No! Don't, kid! No one means what they say. I'll never get home... never! Vala, vala, stop. We'll all die. I want to die. Trask lied to you, but not everyone's like that. Honey, please, don't let him do this to you. Honey, you gotta t-trust me. Please? It's okay. It's okay. Brogan, we're on our way! Yeah, yeah. You all right? No permanent injuries except to my pride. This one's gonna be all right. Good... i want him to have a long life. Come on, kiddo. Let's get you home. Get him out of here! Brogan, kid all squared away? I.d.m.p. Managed to track down her folks. They'll be taking her there real soon. What's the word on skall street? Quiet, good quiet. They're having a shindig tonight. Thought I'd take the family. I guess the girl is not the only one going home. Patrick, vala is leaving. Have a good time, chief. You can't believe how many sandwiches I packed for her flight. It's the overprotective mother in me. You okay? Yeah. We did make a difference. Goodbyes make me sick. I wish I could take you all with me. Well, we'll come visit soon. I promise. Better get going, honey. Don't wanna miss our flight. You take good care. See ya, kid. Bye. I forgot something. It's for you, so you won't be scared of storms. Bye. Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Azul says she really liked her. You tell azul she's not alone.
