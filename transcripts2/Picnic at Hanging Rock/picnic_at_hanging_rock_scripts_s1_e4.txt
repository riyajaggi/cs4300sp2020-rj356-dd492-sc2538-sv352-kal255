 [ Laughter ] [ Platform clinking ] Bertie? Bertie! Where are you?! It's okay, Sprout. I've got ya. YOUNG WOMAN: I didn't mean to hurt her. [ Indistinct talking ] - Shh. - Mademoiselle, I'm so sorry. Oh, they were out of control. Just wait until I tell Mrs. Appleyard. You will not. I don't think that you are fit to be in charge of young ladies. Perhaps. Perhaps I watch out for them in other ways.

 [ Moans ] - I forgot she was there. - God. Oh, Sara. I want to see... Irma. Irma has come. WOMAN: Girls. Girls, get over here. Get over here. Cook's made your favorite breakfast. Porridge with treacle. Come on. Tom'll be fatter than me if he keeps scoffing all these meals you won't touch. Porridge with treacle is my brother's favorite. - Your brother Bertie? - Yeah. He's coming for me, Minnie. I know it. Of course he is. And he'd want you to eat. To stay strong. Bertie's the best rider. He loves horses. We'll join a circus. Is that so? Well, eat up, then. Miranda says there are pretty circus ladies who ride horses, and they stand on one leg. Ah! [ Gasps ] We really should pack up Miranda Reid's things. For safekeeping. Yes, ma'am. Your shoulders are the bane of Miss Lumley's life. You know, if you didn't slouch... ...well, you wouldn't need the posture board, would you? I've come to understand what a clever little spy you are. You must have a great collection of special secrets. I was your age once. I know all about collecting secrets. You don't know anything. [ Footsteps departing ] Hysteria is an unattractive malady which must be extinguished. The remedy shall be fresh air... and organ music. It is the Sabbath. This morning, we shall return to church. - [ Gasps ] - Please collect your hats, gloves, and capes. Blanche, make sure that the girls proceed to the drag in an orderly fashion. Yes, Mrs. Appleyard. - Off you go. - [ Indistinct conversations ] Miss Lumley. Take Sara to her room. She appears to have a rash. Keep an eye on her. But... you mean stay here? But I'll miss the sermon. I'm sure your faith is strong enough to be tested. Indeed, it is. [ Indistinct conversations ] [ Bell tolling ] Well, well, well. Hello, Esther, love. [ Tolling continues ] [ Eerie music plays ] [ Indistinct whispering ] [ Whispering continues ] Give it back. Give it back. Give it back! Drive on, Mr. Hussey. We're going home. Drive on! Hyah! Heel. [ Horse neighs ] Some dark souls people have behind their smiling faces. Could never have imagined. Those young ladies have been defiled. And tossed into the ravine a dozen times a day since they've disappeared. Well, that shows how ignorant people are. Outrages occur behind innocent front doors, not out in nature. I'm starting to wonder if there could've been foul play. MRS. BUMPHER: If they're at the bottom of a ravine, that's because they held hands and jumped. Don't look at me like that. Have you any idea what goes on inside the minds of girls that age? What they get up to when they're not supervised? It must have seemed like such a grand adventure. At first. [ Animal screeching ] [ Wings flapping ] [ Gasps, mumbles ] [ Gasps, grunts ] [ Grunts ] [ Snores ] [ Door closes ] [ Suspenseful music plays ] [ Knock on door, door opens ] [ Drawer opens ] NOLAN: [ Straining ] [ Grunting ] [ Sighs ] [ Laughs ] So, are you gonna marry me? I already said yes. [ Gunshot ] [ Dog barking in distance ] Stay here. [ Breathing heavily ] You're all maniacs. WILKINS: Steady, there. Easy, now. Put the gun down. Miss Sara. - [ Gasps ] - Are you all right? MADEMOISELLE: Girls. Look away. - Why are the police here? - Inside. Quickly. - [ Speaking French ] - Why are the police here? YOUNG WOMAN: What is it, Mademoiselle? SERGEANT BUMPHER: Sorry to do this in front of the girls. NOLAN: Lying bitch! I see you two are acquainted? There was an incident with one of the girls. - Which girl? - Miranda Reid. He showed an unwelcome interest. It was at the government cottage fête. It was unimportant. He was drunk then, too. Trodden on by his horse. - Bullshit! - Language! Sluice him down before you put him in the wagon. Yes, boss. - Why do you own a gun? - It belonged to my late husband. Why did you station an officer on my property without asking my permission? I heard you were having some trouble with a possum. Sergeant, I have told you before. This is a ladies' college, and I am charged with their reputations. That is an Enfield. It's a highwayman's gun. What are you doing with a highwayman's gun? Speaking of highwaymen. Any news on the two riders? I believe they were shearers. Since when do shearers ride valuable horses? You will remove yourself and the young pup you've sent to guard us. Immediately. I am more than capable of looking after my own girls. If I had been on that picnic, none of this would have happened. Why didn't you go on the picnic? I dislike the Australian landscape. It is insubordinate. YOUNG WOMAN: Where did she find the gun? YOUNG WOMAN #2: I don't know, but I don't trust her. She's dangerous. YOUNG WOMAN #1: Lucky she didn't shoot us. YOUNG WOMAN #3: It's clear that Sara Waybourne is evil. SARA: How many days on the train? Five. Just you and me. Then two days' drive from Mackay. [ Both chuckle ] Oh, Reg, Reg, Reg, Reg! Oh! Surely these girls should be more modest. Well, if you change your mind, I'll be at the Menzies. I've ordered marrons glacés, so it should still feel like Christmas, - even in this horrid heat. - [ Laughs ] I love Christmas here. It's peaceful. I get to read all day. [ Both chuckle ] Penelope! We must go. [ Indistinct conversations ] Your mum must be very busy wrapping all your presents. We will take you to your house on our way to the station. [ Chuckles ] Thank you. MIRANDA: Blanche, in the back. [ Indistinct conversations ] I'm so excited. They're cleaning. Everything's covered in dust sheets. It's nice and cool in here. Not for long. I'm boiling these buggers. Off you go! [ Humming "Good King Wenceslas" ] I just did the floors in there, Miss Marion. So shoo! Christmas spirit everywhere we turn. - [ Chuckles ] - [ Humming continues ] My father sent me a crate of books. So I heard. You can borrow any you like. [ Chuckles ] Our room bakes in the afternoon. I know a nook. What are you reading? "The Turn of the Screw." Sounds dull. Is it about carpentry? [ Laughs ] I don't think so. I can go back to the beginning, if you like. "The story had held us, 'round the fire, sufficiently breathless, but for the obvious remark that it was gruesome, as, on Christmas Eve in an old house"... "Gruesome." Go on. "I remember no comment uttered till somebody happened to say that it was the only case he had met in which such a visitation had fallen on a child." A visitation! [ Both laugh ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Indistinct conversation ] [ Notes play ] "The apparition had reached the landing halfway up and was therefore on the spot nearest the window, where at the sight of me, it stopped short and fixed me exactly as it had fixed me from the tower and from the garden." Oh, my Lord. Go on. "He knew me as well as I knew him; and so, in the cold, faint twilight, with a glimmer in the high glass and another on the polish of the oak stair below, we faced each other in our common intensity. He was absolutely, on this occasion, a living, detestable, dangerous presence." [ Bell ringing ] We should go. Cook will skin us alive. We could continue after dinner. In the dark? I'll have night terrors. Well, that would be the fun of it. [ Thunder crashing ] No one can sleep tonight. I think Mrs. Appleyard has gone up to the tower. That's odd. Shall I go on? Oh, I wish we'd never started this terrible story. Don't stop. Do you believe in ghosts? I don't know. "'She isn't there, little lady. Nobody's there. How can poor Miss Jessel be there when poor Miss Jessel's dead and buried?'" It's interesting to me that you chose to remain here for Christmas, despite the luxuries offered by Miss Leopold. Yes, I did. Have you considered what you'll do when you finish your senior year? Not really. Unfortunately, Marion, the sort of husband you deserve is unlikely to propose. I would like to offer you work. What sort of work? Teaching history. You would have your own room, you would eat meals with the staff. Obviously you wouldn't interact with the parents directly. But you may come to view that as a privilege, not a punishment. Naturally you will receive the same wage as the other teachers... with holiday entitlements. How generous. Thank you, Mrs. Appleyard. Hello, ladies. I'm back. [ Chuckles ] Where's Marion? [ Marion laughing ] History's so dull. Will you accept? Yes. For one reason only. Shall we find out how it ends? I don't want it to end. Everything ends. Unless you stay in between. It's easier there. In between? What does that mean? YOUNG WOMAN: Welcome back! How was your Christmas? YOUNG WOMAN #2: Did you have a nice holiday? - Irma's cross with me. - Why? I don't know. Blanche is her favorite now. She's invited her to sleep in our room. How was your holiday? - It was sublimely stupendous. - [ Laughs ] - I rescued a baby wallaby. - Ooh. A joey. [ Chuckles ] And my horse was called Beatle. He taught me how to ride him. Yeah, Beatle's quite chatty for a horse. I had a sublimely stupendous time, too. ALBERT: Well, well, well. - How 'bout this? - [ Laughs ] Didn't expect you. Thought you'd be on the run after what happened. I needed to get away. Get my head straight. Make some decisions. I can understand that. I'm gonna go traveling. Up north. Queensland, for starters. Meant to be beautiful country up there. Thought I'd visit Miss Reid's family. Pay my respects. And... ...Albert, I... ...I want you to come with me. ALBERT: Wouldn't be right. Eh. Couldn't leave your uncle in the lurch. [ Chuckles ] Well, I'm sure he could replace you easily enough. [ Both chuckle ] You told me you like traveling. I do. But I'm, um... I'm a working man. I wouldn't be able to pay my way. We wouldn't be equals. No. Not in that way. But... ...we would be equals in every other sense. That's the way that matters to me. Yes. Of course. As you know, a number of girls have been withdrawn by their parents. I expect there will be others who will not return after the Easter holiday. I will rename the college, then advertise. From today, the missing are not to be spoken of, or referred to by the girls. I have given it a great deal of thought. I have their best interests at heart. Miss Lumley, our daily prayers will no longer remember them. Yes, a great misadventure has befallen us. But we must lay down this burden. From this moment on... ...it will be as though they never existed. I'd like to box your ears! You're old enough to know better, that's for damn sure. You won't improve on her. Money and beauty. What on earth are you thinking? I'm thinking a man's measure is an honest day's work. - What the deuce? - And I've never done a day of work in my entire life. Now, listen to me, Michael. We Fitzhuberts... It's Mike. Not Michael. Mike. [ Door opens, closes ] MINNIE: I don't know who did it, ma'am. We both know who's responsible. Get them down immediately. [ Knock on door ] - Fetch help. - [ Knocking continues ] Mrs. Appleyard. Good morning. - Where's my daughter? - Blanche is asleep. - As are the other girls. - We've come to take her home. We've ridden through the night. So if you don't mind waking her. Well, let's take a turn around the garden whilst I have some breakfast prepared. Decisions shouldn't be made on an empty stomach. I'll get her myself. [ Door closes ] What in blazes?! Blanche?! Blanche! [ Young women shouting "Blanche!" mockingly ] [ Laughter, shouting continues ] [ Birds chirping ] [ Indistinct conversation ] MRS. FITZHUBERT: Yes. All right. Uh, you wanted to see me? Crundall, yes. You've received a letter. I assumed it was for us. As it's from Mr. Leopold. Mr. Leopold? Miss Irma's father. Who writes to thank you. For finding his daughter. It wasn't me, sir. - It was... - Michael. Yes. Who has returned to Melbourne. On some tomfool plan to travel. The boy hasn't been right in the head since that wretched picnic. Very honorable of you, Crundall, to constantly refuse the glory. But it was you who rescued her, for all practical purposes. Wait, man. There's more. A check. For £1,000. MRS. FITZHUBERT: Someone of your standing will have little experience of such a ludicrous sum. You would do well to seek the advice of my husband. Can I have the afternoon off, sir? I'll make it up on my Friday. Of course. [ Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" plays ] [ Music stops, resumes ] - [ Music stops ] - Stop moving the paper! I can't read when you are moving the paper. [ Sighs ] Now. [ Music resumes ] [ Music stops, resumes, door opens ] - [ Music stops ] - MRS. VALANGE: Sara. Class started 10 minutes ago. I'm not allowed art anymore. She's to help me prepare for the annual Woodend concert. [ Music resumes ] MRS. VALANGE: I know she misbehaves. But you must concede she's more talented than any of the others. What does talent have to do with bad behavior? It's... It's cruel to deny her what she loves. What does cruelty have to do with teaching good behavior? Am I answerable to you, Mrs. Valange? No, but you are answerable to the parents. Sara's lessons have been paid for. Sara's guardian hasn't paid her fees since before Christmas. [ Scoffs ] You know him to be a man of excellent character. He travels. To places mail can't get through. And then he bowls up out of thin air with bequests for the college. And gifts for Sara. You can't question his commitment to her. I run this establishment as I see fit. And I think you run it abominably. The girls are confused. The only thing they learn here is how to be afraid. The staff, as well. The only person who respects you is a simpleton. Worse! Dora Lumley has been mistreated since the day she was born. She's like some poor mad dog. Be careful she doesn't turn around and bite you one day. I gather this is your resignation? It most certainly is. [ Door opens ] Oh! No, leave it, Tom. I've been such a fool. Thank you. [ Down-tempo music plays ] MRS. APPLEYARD: I'm sorry to say your guardian Mr. Cosgrove has abandoned you, as well. Sara. Your behavior concerns me. Deeply. Either you will allow me to guide you. Or I will be forced to return you to the orphanage. [ Exhales sharply ] [ Indistinct conversations, child crying ] [ Child coughing ] MRS. McCREADY: Waybourne, you say? ALBERT: Sara. Last time I came here they told me she'd been adopted out to a fella with a fortune. Figured she'd be better off with him. But now I've got the money myself... - I... - Ah, yes. Mr. Cosgrove. Now, if I could just have his address... MRS. McCREADY: All we have is one in London. Which I'm not at liberty to disclose. Like I said, I've... I've got the money. Maybe she's forgotten about me by now. I don't know. But I told her I'd be back. I tried once. Now I'm trying twice. I'm gonna keep trying until I find her. If you like, I can write and tell him of your recent good fortune and your wish to be reunited with Sara. Mr. Cosgrove would appear to be the very best of men. This Cosgrove is fine if you say so. But I'm her brother. Whoa. [ Bell clanging ] [ Sighs ] Tom. You're to give to this to Sara Waybourne as soon as possible. Without alerting Mrs. Appleyard. Yes, ma'am. Good luck, Tom. Say goodbye to Minnie for me. [ Train whistle blows ] - ALBERT: G'day, Tom. - [ Chuckles ] Didn't think I'd see you again. Just wanted to say goodbye. Goodbye? Where are you going? Minnie and I are getting married. - About time. - [ Laughs ] Thought I might make a go of it in the city. They reckon they got jobs there for blokes like me. Doing all sorts. Future beckons. - [ Bell clangs ] - That's right. [ Bell clangs, train whistle blows ] Hey. You know anyone who could give me a hand with a letter? Come down to the college. There's a French lady there... Madem'selle. She writes all of ours. Likes to practice English. Okay. Thanks. [ Clicks tongue ] [ Clicks tongue ] Come on. MRS. LEOPOLD: "On behalf of the parents of the missing, I've arranged for a detective from Scotland Yard - to investigate." - [ Gasps ] [ Knock on door ] Dr. Mackenzie is here for Edith's toothache. [ Door closes ] Miss Leopold's father has taken it upon himself to help us. A senior detective from Scotland Yard is bound for these fair shores. - As we speak. - A muckety-muck from London. Ah, you'll be out in the bush looking for him next. I'm bloody sick of everyone's bullshit. Something's not right about that college. What if those girls got lost on purpose? We've been looking for girls who want to be found. Oh, my word. And you are? Mr. Tomasetti. Tomasetti Marble. - Mrs., uh... - Appleyard. TOMASETTI: Mrs. Appleyard. Commiserations, madam. The whole country is praying for them young ladies to be found. Safe and well. So, are these the, uh... the wenches in need of my attention? Yes, I wish to replace them. Well, why not make them respectable instead? I mean, there's stone to work with. Now, let's see. I would, uh... I would find the clothes beneath the flesh. What I suggest is, you just slice off the breasts and release the inner garments. Thank you for coming out. But I'm sure you understand that now is not a convenient time. All eyes are upon you. This college mystery is all anyone talks about these days. It is the perfect time for concealment. Scandal is to be avoided. So, I'm your man, if you want something covered up. So, I'm just south of Bendigo, down on main road. [ Door opens ] So sorry. Doctor, Edith's right upstairs, and she's making quite a fuss. SERGEANT BUMPHER: Might be all right for "Mad Dog" Morgan. I can't imagine a young lady would much like it. Three wouldn't even fit. [ Sighs ] If you're running away, where would you go? Now ride to Bendigo. - [ Mid-tempo music plays ] - MADEMOISELLE: [ Speaks French ] Very good. [ Speaking French ] Good. Just imagine there is a string, a little string attached to your head. Remember to stand straight, girls. Very good. [ Speaking French ] Don't forget to smile. [ Speaking French ] That's right, good posture. No, Edith. You're not supposed to spin around. But I wanna be the girl. [ Sighs, speaks French ] Merci beaucoup. [ Music stops, indistinct conversations ] SARA: Mademoiselle? Oui? Can she really send me back to the orphanage? Sara. Your pocket. It bulges like the toad. It's Miranda. She's always with me. Si belle. MIRANDA: Sara? Are you asleep? No. I'm too excited about the picnic. Me too. [ Match strikes ] I've got a present for you. It's from our holiday. Happy St. Valentine's Day. - For tomorrow. - Sisters. That's right. You must learn to love people other than me. Hmm? MADEMOISELLE: Sara? Why does Irma hate Miranda? Because she's free. But free where? She's always been free. [ Knock on door ] - Hello. - G'day, Els. Uh, Tom said I should see a... Madem'selle? About a letter. After a French letter, are you? Wait here. [ Down-tempo music plays ] [ Woman vocalizing ] I know who you are, you know. You saved our Irma. To whom is the letter? Mike Fitzhubert. MADEMOISELLE: Michael Fitzhubert? But put, uh, Mike, or he won't know it's from me. All right. So, "Dear Mike..." "I've come into some money. And I've given in my notice at Lake View." Just put, um... "Meet me any afternoon at the Post Office Hotel on Bourke Street. We can have a beer and fix a date for Queensland." You are friends? Yeah. Can I leave this with you? Post's been collected from Lake View. Yes, of course. Thank you. Who shall it be from? - ALBERT: Albert. - [ Gasps ] Bertie? [ Hoofbeats departing ] Bertie? Bertie! Bertie! Did you see him? Is he real? The coachman from Lake View? - Of course. - The coachman from Lake View. MADEMOISELLE: Well, for not much longer. He is leaving. Like everyone else. ARTHUR: I challenge you! I challenge ya! You! [ Train chugging ] [ Train whistle blows ] [ Whispering ] Nobody's home. We're all alone. Mousey, you and I. [ Train chugging ] MRS. APPLEYARD: Nobody's home. We're all alone. Mousey, you and I. [ Train whistle blows ] [ Train chugging ] [ Train whistle blows ] [ Bell clangs ] [ Stair creaking ] [ Suspenseful music plays ] [ Door closes ] [ Panting ] [ Gasps ] [ Animal screeching ] [ Creaking ] MIRANDA: Sara.
