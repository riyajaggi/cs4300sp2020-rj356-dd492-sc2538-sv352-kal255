 Picnic at Hanging Rock (2018): Season 1, Episode 5 - Episode #1.5 - full transcript 
 French governess, Mademoiselle, is growing increasingly suspicious of Mrs Appleyard's erratic behavior, and fears the worst when she is told that Sara was unexpectedly collected by her guardian, unseen by any other staff. As Mademoiselle searches for answers, the Sergeant travels to Melbourne to seek a last interview with Irma, and a secret vow made by the missing girls is revealed.

 You're in love. One day you will be, too, Greta. And when you and I have children, we will never send them away. Everything ends, unless you stay in between. It's easier there. In between? What does that mean? Mademoiselle? Mademoiselle? We must think about leaving. What time is it?

 Ah, it's still as dead as a doornail. Stopped right on 12:00, same as Miss McCraw's. Something to do with magnets, she reckons. You don't have the time, do you? Oh, mine is being repaired. Madam wanted us back by 8:00. It's about half past 3:00, going by the shadow. I'll harness the horses. Merci. How can time stop at the Rock? It can't. Time is a never-ending explosion. It's you who sends me mad. When will you respond to my proposal?

 Why do you never answer my question? What happened at Hanging Rock was my fault. I cannot leave the college. I do not speak to you in French because we live in the present, not in the past. What's done is done. I must go. People will talk. Thank you. Au revoir, Mademoiselle. Au revoir, Myrtle. Come along here, love. Chin up. It's for the best, darling. You're back. Yes. I saw Myrtle leaving. Going home for Easter? She won't be returning to us. An unpromising child. No great loss. Oh. I brought a little treat for Sara. I must hide it from Cook. Sara's appetite is no longer our concern. Her guardian came to collect her this morning. - No. - No? What do you mean no? But she was in no state to travel. I agree with you, but her guardian would not be persuaded. - Mr. Cosgrove? - Yes, Mr. Cosgrove. Whom else would I be speaking of? If you'd be kind enough to pack up Sara's things. There wasn't time this morning, and I said I'd send them on. Oh! Oh, you made me jump! I just came for the sheets. Madam has had me stuck in the laundry all morning. - In the laundry? - Yeah. Madam got it into her head to bleach all the linen. So, you did not see Sara? No. Didn't get to say goodbye. Poor lamb. That's Sara's Valentine. From Miss Miranda. Yes. She carried it with her always. Yeah. She must've been in a rush, like me. No. She would never have left it. Me and Tom are leaving tomorrow. We're getting hitched. Oh, Minnie! That's... Lucky he asked. Couple more weeks, he wouldn't have had a choice in the matter. I am so happy for you. Miss Lumley. Have we no dance class today? Uh, this is music appreciation. The girls are appreciating my music. You were here all morning? Yes, the holidays haven't started yet. Dora, did you say au revoir to Sara? Did you see Mr. Cosgrove? No. Unlike some, I have been very busy. Now, you'll notice the mood changes here. Do you know if Sara had breakfast before she left this morning? Her tray was untouched, as usual. Picky little eater. Yes. I was just wondering if perhaps you had seen her guardian's carriage while you were in the vegetable garden. No. I wasn't here this morning. The missus gave me the morning off to visit my sister. All very nice, but you can bet she still expects her supper at the same time. Good afternoon, Tom. Were you around this morning? Running errands in Woodend. Has Minnie told you our news? Yes. Congratulations. For Miss Sara. I almost forgot. From Miss Valange. Can you send it to her? Of course. I-I must just find the address of Mr. Cosgrove. Mrs. Valange said to make sure the boss lady doesn't see it. Tom, is Mr. Whitehead still busy in the greenhouse? Far as I know, Missus. Bye. Dear Sara, I'm sorry not to have had a chance to say goodbye. I was given no choice in the matter. My concerns for you are compounded by the events of this morning. This is to say that you will always have a home with me in East Melbourne. Give this letter to Mademoiselle, and she will arrange it. Do not deal directly with the head. She is not to be trusted. Dianne? Oh, mon dieu! You frightened me. And yet I am not the intruder. I was just looking for Mr. Cosgrove's address... to send on Sara's things. His plans were not yet fixed. Unconventional, as always. But he made it clear... ...that Sara would not be returning. But her name is still there in the ledger. Hester, is it? You're a clever little girl. You'll run 'em 'round the houses without even having to lift your pinafore. In or out, Dora. This way, you're only letting the heat out. That French flibbertigibbet is asking everyone about Mr. Cosgrove. Whether they saw him or his carriage. And she's going on and on about the photograph. What photograph? Of Miranda. She keeps saying Sara would never have left it behind. I think I recall that photograph. It was in a valuable frame. Surely that didn't belong to Sara. It was her Valentine. Miss Leopold donated the frame. Shall I fetch Mamsell? No. Dora, tell me. Do you ever suffer from... memories? How do you keep them at bay? Prayer. Of course. I see. Would you like to pray together, Hester? Good night, Dora. Fucked up, didn't you, mad bitch? Now, tell me. Why are you in Australia? Well, I came here to be a governess to a young lady, Cecile. But she died, unfortunately. She was already very sick when I arrived. And now I must find work. We're very isolated here. Won't you miss your family? No. My family is gone. An epidemic. Unfortunately, many people were taken in the village where I am from. I'm so sorry. So... you are a woman alone. Yes. Your mother had a saying? Yes, she used to say, "A woman alone is like a broken egg." A broken egg? Yes. Well We're not alone anymore, are we? Welcome to Appleyard College, Mademoiselle de Poitiers. Merci beaucoup! I'm scared. Ah. You're buying time. Distract them with details. Stick to the story. It's not a lie if you believe it. And... And if I need to bolt, don't let anyone get in my way. That's my girl. What happened... to the orphan? C-Could she have run away? But she had nowhere to go. There is an invitation to stay with Mrs. Valange, but... It is perhaps too late. And Mrs. Appleyard says the girl's guardian came to collect her. Why would she lie? I don't know. You said the orphan was too weak to travel. Sara will not eat. She was in adoration with Miranda, so now her heart is broken. And she is full of melancholy, punished very often. Punished how? Kept in the tower, like Rapunzel. I feel like a terrible shadow has fallen. Have you telegraphed her guardian? So you have no evidence that anything happened to anyone. I am sorry to disturb you. You haven't drunk your tea. Thank you. I must go. He's been looking for the girls everywhere. All over Bendigo. He's at his wits' end. I understand. - I'll go to Melbourne. - Melbourne? Miss Leopold's ship has docked. She'll be off any minute. Girls, don't worry. Everything is fine. They are coming back. Just, please, Myrtle. Just stay here. Lily and Rose, you come here, please. - Come here. - Where's Miss McCraw? Come. Rosamund, Blanche. You must stay together, please. I need to go to the privy. That's where Miss McCraw went, and she's disappeared, too. Girls! Miss McCraw is most certainly searching for your classmates. It's Miranda's fault. We should go look for them. No. Stay together. Girls! Shh. You stay together. You shh. Any sign of them? What's wrong? I am a bad teacher. I have been a friend to the girls. But they do not need a friend. They need a protector. They are children. I have been blind and weak. Everyone's gone mad since that picnic. I must borrow your bicycle. Stay here. Stay here. Stay here until the morning. I have to go. Now you. Do you believe me? I believe that you should not go back there. I am safe. She will not harm me. The remaining girls will soon return home for Easter. Until then, I must protect them. My clothes are downstairs. I'll go and get them. Wait. Not yet. I will go when it's busy outside. People will see you. - Yes. - Mm. She must not know that I have spoken to the Sergeant. Better to cause a scandal. Have you decided whether to employ that stonemason? He didn't impress me. There was something disreputable about him. I suppose that's the thing about Australia being so far away. We... attract all sorts. What do you mean? I don't know the first thing about you. Don't know who you were before you opened this place. And I don't care. How about a fresh start... ...with a different name? As a doctor's wife? Anywhere you like, city or country. There's opportunities out here. A respectable couple's an asset to any community. A respectable couple? You could hold your own soiree. I could have a baby. Hester, what... Hester, wait! Hester! - You'll be all right. - I'll miss you. You'll be okay. All right. Take care of each other, all right? Appreciate it. All right. Halt! Who are you? What do you want? - Don't you recognize me? - Should I? I am Reg Lumley, the brother of your deportment mistress. Why have we never met? Madam, we have met on several occasions. She knows me. Yeah. How can we help you, Mr. Lumley? I have come to collect my sister. The Easter holiday doesn't begin until tomorrow. Well, she won't be coming back. Dora! Mademoiselle, find Dora. Help her pack. Don't you want to know why? Nope. Reg. You're coming home, sister mine. - No. - It is my opinion... I agree with your brother. You should go. No. No! - It is my opinion... - No. No, I am the good girl, and I do everything that you say! I do everything right! No, no, no. You can't be on his side! It's not fair! It's not fair. What is she still doing here? You did not sleep in your bed last night, Miss. You slut! She's a slut! I'll tell you where she lay last night. With the watchmaker. Is this true? Did you stay with Monsieur Montpelier last night? Oui. Hm! Well, the drag will be here soon. You should disentangle the intermediates, help them pack. Get your things, Dora. This place is a madhouse! But... Go on, get your things. Let me help you. Au revoir, Mademoiselle. Bye. Bye. Au revoir, Rosamund. Don't forget to write letters. I hope I will see you again. Au revoir. Bye, Lily. Hyah! Go on. Giddap. Come on, Edith. Your mum will be here soon. Why do you think my mother is always late? Do you think she forgets all about me? You must be strong, Edith. Do not wait for others to approve. Do not try to make them happy. Dance your own steps. So, I can be the lady for a change? Yes. Yes. You can be the lady. Why are you wearing the same dress as yesterday? A lady does not remark on a gentleman's outfit, Edith. Just the two of us. Shall we? Regent's Park Ladies Academy. What do you think? Very elegant. Were Sara and Mr. Cosgrove stopping in Melbourne? I blame the orphanage. You can never recover from a bad start in life, no matter how your fortunes might change. Where did you grow up? Have you ever been in love, Dianne? Yes. Head or the heart. Whichever you choose, the other will haunt you. You never talk about your husband. I've given Cook her notice. Clean sweep. What's necessary above all else is to attract the right sort of girl. The sort that can be relied upon. No orphans or bastards and certainly no tomboys. And experienced teachers whose behavior is above reproach. Well... ...Monsieur Montpelier has asked me to marry him. Do you think I care about that? You lost my girls! Your services are no longer required. You may leave first thing in the morning. Clean sweep. Children, we have a visitor. Let us show him what good Christians you are. Hester! Hester, is it? How do you do? Come on, then, Arthur. I'm ready. Show yourself. Ooh, you're a clever little girl. You'll run 'em 'round the houses without even having to lift your pinafore. Now, we need an hour. No more. It was the schooner Hesperus that sailed the wintry seas. And the skipper had taken his little daughter to bear him company. Blue were her eyes as the fairy-flax, her cheeks like the dawn of day, and her bosom white as the hawthorn buds that ope in the month of May. The skipper, he stood beside the helm. His pipe was in his mouth. And he watched how the veering flaw did blow. The smoke now West, now South. Dianne, is that you? And he watched how the veering flaw did blow. The smoke now West, now South. Thank you. - Is there any news? - No. If you're here to ask if my memory has improved, it hasn't. I'm not interested in what happened at the Rock. I'm interested in before. The picnic? No. I know everything about the picnic. Edith had seconds. Before. At Appleyard College. That ludicrous name. A finishing school in the middle of nowhere. No hint of society, just a tin-pot town. So you weren't happy there? What excellent powers of deduction. Your missing friends, what did they feel about the place? None of us was there voluntarily. Miss McCraw. How did you get on with her? Fine. Miss Lumley was the only one we didn't like. Her and her brother. My goodness. Sorry. I hope they're not relatives of yours. - Mrs. Appleyard. - What about her? You tell me. She's a fraud. What do you mean? Well, our bread was put on the right instead of the left. Potatoes were served with fish. I saw her offer brandy at afternoon tea. What's wrong with that? Punch or lemonade but not wine. She clearly didn't come from real society. She was a climber. Well, here's what I know. I've been told a lot of nonsense by a lot of people. I reckon you girls decided to take off, and something went wrong. That's good. Good. It's almost perfect, Miranda. It's just Oh, okay. Very good, Marion. - Mamsell? - Oui? What does "salope" mean? Where did you hear this word? It's what Irma's mother calls her. - "Une vraie petite salope." - Liar. This is not a word to be repeated. I'm very surprised to hear it from your mouth. - You of all people, Rosamund. - I'm sorry. I-I thought if a Rothschild could say it... Liar! Liar! Liar! She told me her mother said it... on her wedding day, when Irma kissed her new father with her tongue! Immediately apologize! Sorry. Asseyez-vous! She knows it's true, Mademoiselle. You must be ashamed. Our headmistress will soon clear those smug looks from your faces. What does "salope" mean? Slut. Irmlette. Go away. Don't be silly. I don't want you. You don't care about me. That's not true. Oh, stop pretending. I know about you and Miss McCraw. I love her. Since when? We've never held hands. We've never kissed the way you kiss. My stepfather... kissed me. I didn't kiss him. Well, then he's the scallop, not you. It's not a "scallop." Oh, honestly. You're such a bumpkin. - I hate Blanche. - I've always hated Blanche. I should never have told her anything. It's your fault, though. You know what I did this Christmas? Nothing. I got a telegraph from Papa and nothing from Mama. Even the chambermaids had each other! I had no one. You're lucky. You can buy anything. A hotel room. A hotel. And you can lock the doors. My parents expect me to marry as soon as I get out of here. I don't want to be with anyone. I do. Mrs. Appleyard has asked me to stay and teach history. It's a generous offer for a girl like me, as long as I hide around the parents. Of course I'll see Miss McCraw. But she says we have to remain in between. Pretending and hiding. Pretending for the rest of my life. I hate them all. What spell did you cast in the roses? Was there a plan to run away? There was no plan. Do you know Sara Waybourne? Of course. Heard from her lately? No. She may have disappeared, as well. - Sara? - This is not a game, Irma. I know that! You know something. Oh, yes I do. Never surrender.
