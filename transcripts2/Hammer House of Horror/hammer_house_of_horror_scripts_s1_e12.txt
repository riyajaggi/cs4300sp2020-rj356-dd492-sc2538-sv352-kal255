 A hitch-hiker dressed in yellow oil skins attacks the driver of a car who has stopped to give him a lift. The car crashes and the driver fights with the insane hitch-hiker. It appears like the driver, though badly injured, has prevailed and is taken to hospital. The drivers wife subsequently learns that her husband has damaged his throat in the struggle and is unable to talk, she is also asked to identify the body of the madman. The body looks exactly like her husband and doubts begin to enter her mind as to which of the two is the killer. The only differences appear to be that the killer has rotten teeth and a claw-like finger nail. Who survived the fight her husband or the madman?

 - You didn't hit him. - Was he hitchhiking? I can see him. Want a lift? He's standing still. He can get in the back. No! David, hop in the back. Not going very far, I'm afraid. Where are you heading? Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Martin! David, David... David! Darling. She's awake! My mother's awake! Martin... Martin! Darling. How are you feeling? - My husband... - He's all right. Where is he? Oh. You're not wearing a dressing gown. Wait here, David, would you? Come along. Your husband had to have an emergency operation last night. - For what? - Sit down. There's absolutely nothing to be alarmed about. What sort of operation? He had glass from the windscreen in his throat. The w... The windscreen? He was very, very lucky. So were you. Nothing worse than a bad bump on the head. And some bruising. The most fortunate thing was that Mr Roberts went out looking for you in the storm. How is the... We had a... another passenger. Martin? Darling? You mustn't try to talk. Oh, my poor sweetheart. Well, you had a piece of glass this long. Missed the carotid by a hair's breadth. Otherwise, apart from severe bruising, no structural damage to the throat. He can come off the drip. Now, can you swallow? Hmm. Hurts a bit, eh? Well, don't worry, old chap. We'll have you out of here in a jiffy. He should rest more. Ah, now, it's very important that he doesn't talk for a few days. - Doctor... - Mr Cummings. Mr Cummings, you must realise the cause of those injuries. - He was attacked. - Oh, I am sorry... - Please. - I thought a car crash. If you don't mind, Mrs Lewis. We picked up a maniac. - Mrs Lewis! - He made us crash. Where is he? - I'm afraid I... - Sorry, sir. - I want to know what happened to him. - Mr Cummings operated on your husband. He is not acquainted with the circumstances of the accident. - But the cause of those bruises? - And he's extremely busy. Look, Sister, is it really necessary that...? Absolutely not. I apologise. Thank you very much for what you've done for my husband. JANET. Where are... our things? Our suitcases. They're here. In a storeroom. The police asked us. The police? They want to talk to you. I'll lock after David. Now, don't worry. They're waiting for you. Well, we've already spoken to your son. There's not very much he can tell us about the crash. He may have been knocked out for awhile. Anyway, his memory seems to be a complete blank from just before it happened. - But he's all right? - Yes. Don't worry. It's not unusual. Now... - Your husband was driving the car? - Yes. And you ran into the storm last night? We picked up a hitchhiker who attacked my husband, causing us to crash. Can you describe this person? There wasn't time. It was dark, it was raining. He attacked my husband as soon as he got in the car. - How soon before this did you pick him up? - No distance. A few hundred yards, a quarter of a mile. What was he wearing? A raincoat. A sort of oilskin. Th-the kind that fishermen wear. And a hat, the same material. After the crash, do you have any recollection at all of what happened? I was unconscious. 1 woke up in the hospital. You remember nothing at all? No. What happened? Who...? Why? Oh, how could... What does it mean? Oh...! Ahh! Ahh! David's favourite toy. Everything was scattered over a wide area. Everything. The hospital will lend you some things to wear. It would appear that there'd been a... terrible struggle between your husband and the other man. - But Martin... - Your husband was fighting for your lives against a madman. What kind of creature?! He must be found. You'll have to catch him. That won't be necessary. What? We think we already have him. You think? We found a body. - Dead? - Yes. It was some distance from the accident. We need you to identify it. - No. - We have to be sure. Unless you can identify it as the hitchhiker, we don't know if it isn't another innocent... person. Where is it, this body? Here. In the hospital mortuary. If you get dressed, I'll take you down. I'm sorry. I can't. I can't do it. Why don't you sit down? I'm sorry. If you'd rather wait? Oh, no. No. It's all right. I can do it. There's all the time in the worid. - I never saw his face. - You might have blanked it out. One look might bring it back. It's a formality. Never... saw him before. Never! But he was the hitchhiker? I... don't know. His hand. 1 could identify his hand. He had along fingernail. On which hand? The right. Are you sure? Yes. It was the right, without question. - Uncover it. - We can't. What? We don't have the right hand. What do you mean? It was severed in the crash. We still haven't found it. It may have been taken by an animal. A fox or a badger. Loss of blood at the wrist. That was the cause of death. Aaargh! Please. Don't touch me, please. David, where's the ward sister? What? David... we must see your father. What? What? What is it? I've nearly finished my jigsaw puzzle. - We're still going on our holiday, you know. - I know. What did the policeman want? Can I have my aeroplane back? Mum? Come along. I'm going to get you out of here. - Can [ finish my jigsaw? - No. Watt there. I don't want any help! No! I'm doing it myself. It's a lovely house. And it's got a thatched roof. David. Anything else you need, the short cut to the farm's up that path there. - I'll try not to bother you. - Oh, no. It never happened, David. It never ever happened. Ah! Feeling better? Good. Come on. Back to bed and let's have a look at you. Thank you, Sister. That's right. Now, down you go. Good. Mmm. Excellent. Excellent, excellent, excellent. Swallow all right? Excellent. Hello? Yes. Wonderful. And tomorrow morning, the district nurse will visit to change his dressing. Nurse Davies. Thank you. Daddy! - Ah! - David, no! It's even better than I imagined. Mrs Roberts has put flowers in every room. Look, it's got French windows. And my room's straight through here. 1 like our car much better than the old one. Yes. Didn't you notice it? David. Show him what else we found. Oh, yes. {Bell tinkles) - So, whenever you need something, just use this and save your voice. You rang, sir? Come along, darling. You must be exhausted. Shall I leave the light on? It's too big for you. - Have you cleaned your teeth? - You still haven't bought any. We'll get some toothpaste tomorrow. Martin. Good night, darling. Argh! Hiii... Mummy, why have you got that knife? Shh! (Hushed} We must get dressed as quickly as possible. {Rattling) There's some things I forgot to get. Everything was damaged in the accident, you know. We need... some toothbrushes, toothpaste. So we'll take the car. The clothes I borrowed from the hospital will have to be returned. Cr I shall have to get them cleaned. There may be a place in the village I can get them cleaned. And your hospital pyjamas and dressing gown. And some toys for David. Because he must have toys. I saw some toys yesterday in the toy shop. May I have some breakfast? Yoo-hoot! Anyone in? Ah, well, well, well. Here we all are, then. What 3 business, eh? Now, that's what I've come to look at. Face, throat, and hands. I'll just get rid of this. Now... Hang this up. There we are. And we'll get on with it, won't we? There we are. Now, let's just take a peek, shall we? Ah... That's it. There we are. Now... let's have a look. That's it. Ch. Oh, it's a little bit damp. If's a little bit wet, in fact. Air, air, air. That's what I always go on about, lots and lots of air. I think we'll take this right off. That's it. Off it comes. That's it. There we are. Done, done, done. Do you burn your rubbish? You should, you know, especially in this part of the worid. Lots of foxes. Foxes and badgers. Now, all you've got to do is keep that dry. Keep your head back as much as possible. Otherwise you get perspiration, you know. Now your hand. Oh, before I forget, you've got some clothes from the hospital. I promised to collect them. - I was going to get them cleaned. - I shouldn't worry about that. The hospital has its own laundry. Anyway, there isn't one round here. They must be laundered. Can you fetch them? Yes, of course. Your poor hands. It looks so painful. 1 hear you weren't wearing your safety belt. You really should be more careful. Ah, my dear. All he needs now is God's clean air. Air... and lots and lots of rest. Thank you, my dear. They get so frustrated, you know, when they can't talk. They can get awfully hot and bothered. On top of the shock, it all gets 50 tiring for them. He's... He's still very weak. Well, goodbye. David. Wee... going shopping. We won't be long. There she is. Mrs Lewis! Wait a second. - What's the matter? - I want to see the body. - Yes. - I have to identify it. Just wait there. Mrs Lewis! Are you all right? Doctor! Dr Hargreaves! It's all right. It's all right. - Mrs...? - Lewis. Just relax, Mrs Lewis. It's going to be all right. - That's my husband. - Your husband? Mrs Lewis... I'm sorry. But we were given to understand... Mrs Lewis? Hargreaves. Yes. Yes. Double-check that, will you, please? Thank you. Mrs Lewis, I've been informed that your husband underwent a minor operation. Mr Cummings was the surgeon. They say that your husband was discharged and delivered to your home. It wasn't Martin. Mrs Lewis, are you saying the man in your house is not your husband? That... That this is your husband here? Yes. No! - Then what? - Doctor. Mrs Lewis. He's been taken over. What? Like a doppelganger, you mean? What's that? Well, that's a being from another plane. Like one's own other self, which replaces or duplicates one's own body. An evil being? Mrs Lewis, that's the theory. They're not real. Doppelgangers, pods, creatures from other worids? They only exist in fiction. Are you sure? Well... When you've been in this business as long as me, you learn not to be sure of anything. But in this particular case, I'm as sure as I possibly can be. Now, you remember, you've had a very nasty experience. You've suffered a terrible shock. Well, I'm not a shrink. But I am a doctor. And I know the strange results that can come from the after-effects of shock. But he... Now, doesn't your husband have any unusual distinguishing marks? - I don't think so. - Ahem! Now, what about his teeth? Martin had beautiful teeth. White, strong, clean. In that case, this is certainly not your husband. - What? - They can't be his teeth. If the forces of evil did try to replace him, they must have failed. Let me see. What's the matter? Ch, I'm such a silly-billy. I thought your daddy was dead. Martin! Oh, darling. Off you go. I'm going to pour us a good drink. It may take some time... ...but I can explain everything. I've been so silly. Cheers. No... No. No, no... no! Mummy! Who are you? What are you? David, get out your window. Into the car. David, into the car! Oh, my God! The keys. I've left them in the house. The window. You've left it open. Aaaargh! David, listen to me. You must run up to the farm and get Mr Roberts. - No. - Yes, it's our only chance. - No! - Do as I say! Aaargh! Help! Help! Help! Please! Help me! Aaargh! David! Where are you? Thank God. Oh, David. Thank God I found you. Everything's going to be fine. Everything's going to be all right. I'll lock after you. Argh! Aaargh! No! Help! Please, please. - Help me. - What is it? What's the matter, my dear? Don't let them near me. - Good girl, brave girl. - Poor, dear child. No! No, don't let them near me. It's all right, my dear. You're quite safe now. Oh, you... - You will stay with me, won't you? - Of course, my dear. I'll stay with you. No. Oh, no. No...
