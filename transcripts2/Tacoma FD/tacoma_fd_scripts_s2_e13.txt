 - So what's this called? - Let me guess... Burnt figgy pudding left in the oven. - 1970s Christmas-era lights short-circuited and burst into flames. Call 'em Ho-Ho-Homewreckers. - Guy tries to climb down the chimney, gets stuck. - I bet that's the most common one. - It's a classic. - Take it out of your mouth! Take it out! - Whoa. - Be cool! Hey, how's... Season's greetings. - How are ya?

 Everything okay? - Did you call the fire d... - I called, I called, yeah. - Mrs. Santa called. - Is there's an emergency? - There's an emergency. - What happened? - Yuletide stuff... you know. - Yuletide? - You know, celebrating the season. - You want us to come in, sir? - Please come in. Welcome to Santa's workshop. - All righty. What do we got here? - Having a little party, huh? - Welcome to our humble Christmas cottage... The land of magic and dreams. - Got an emergency call. What's the problem? - That would be about Norman. - Is that Norman? - No, that's J.P. He's just chillaxin'. - Then... where's Norman?

 - Ho ho! Wasted! - He had too much fondue. We think he... O.D.ed. - What was in the fondue? - Oh, Swiss cheese, white wine, garlic, uh... 25 hits of ecstasy. - That is a molly jolly Christmas right there! Let me catch... Norman. - Thanks, Granny. - Hey, man, come here. Come here! - What kinda party is this? - It's a Santa-themed swinger's party. - This is a Christmas orgy? - We drink eggnog and have sex. Okay. - Do you like my wreath? My mom made it. - You know what? Norman's fine. You know, just, uh, make sure he's not dehydrated and no more fondue! - Well, you're all welcome to stick around for a while. - Why don't we mingle our ho-ho-hos with your hose, hose, hose? - No, no, no. Dash away, all! - Everybody's welcome, you guys. - I'll stuff your stockings! - I think you came on a little too strong. - Hey! - Ho ho ho, huh? Another year and it still fits. - It's a Christmas miracle! - Merry Christmas, everybody. - Merry Christmas! - Ho ho ho ho! - Oh... whoa! - Hey! - God's sakes, will you people give this Christmas bullshit a rest? I'm trying to do your year-end evaluations, and I can't hear myself think! - Okay. - Ho ho ho, boy, huh? Who pissed in his Cheerios? Noice! - I'm in favor of the music, guys, just so you know. - Hey, Chief, you ever consider giving him this week off? He's always a wet blanket on the holidays. - Yeah. He's always in a bad mood, and it's always when he does our year-end reviews. Every December, we get Scrooged on the write-up. - We gotta do something about it. Eddie! Hey, Eddie, come here. You get a present yet for the Yankee Swap? - Yeah. I found a half-empty bottle of dandruff shampoo in my locker... I'm gonna pop an ugly green bow on it. - Okay. Well, you know what? I'm gonna at lunchtime and get a gift. I can get two and say one's from you. - Oh, cool... you can wrap mine and hand it out for me too. - Ha ha. You don't hand out a gift at the Yankee Swap. Each person picks a number, then they pick a gift. So let's say I go first and you go second. I open my gift, then you open yours. You have the option of deciding to keep your gift or stealing mine, but look out... Anyone who hasn't picked behind us can pick a gift of the person in front of them. So interestingly, the last pick is often the best pick, and the first pick is the worst pick. Are you listening to me? - You're especially humbuggy this year. What's wrong? - Look at these Christmas cards from my ex-girlfriends. Look how happy they are with their happy husbands and their happy kids. - Oh, yeah, Carla, the comptroller's office... I like her. Oh... Jasmine. She was too good for you. I don't know why you're getting so worked up. Half these kids aren't even yours. - That's very funny, Terry. The fact is, all these women asked me to marry them, but I turned them all down. - Yeah, sure you did. - I did. And every year on Christmas, they send me these cards to remind me of what I don't have. - You know what? You have a bad case of the holiday blues. - Maybe I do have the holiday blues, Terry. Or maybe it's that the more obnoxiously jolly you become, the more obnoxiously crusty I have to be to create balance in the universe. - Like Batman and the Joker. - Exactly. Wait... which one am I? - The Joker, of course. - But he's the jolly one. - No, he's the bad guy... Like you. - You think Batman is jollier than the Joker? When's the last time you saw Batman smile? - I don't hang out with Batman, so I can't tell you. - Maybe it was at The Super Friends Yankee Swap because he had the last pick! - Okay, great. Go do your evaluations, and go easy on my crew. - They're my crew too. - Merry Christmas, Eddie! - Eh! Oh! - Look at all this stuff. The kids're gonna go nuts! - And we might just beat our Toy Drive record. - Whoa! Let me see that. - Oh, I forgot. Andy likes dolls. - No! I mean, yes, but... look at this one. - "Public defender Darla." So what? - Look closer. It's supposed to say Public Defender Darla, but thanks to a disgruntled print shop employee, a handful of these babies made it out with the box misspelled. - Oh, pubic defender Darla! Ha ha ha! That's awesome! - It also makes her tag line especially naughty. - Oh, dude... "She'll get you off!" - Whoever dropped that off had no idea how valuable it was. - Why, how valuable is it? - We're talking this valuable, baby. - $15,000? - Wait... what? - 15 grand? We're selling it, right? - No, you guys. It's not ours to sell. Someone gave this as a donation for a child. - Are you kidding me? We're gonna give it to some drooling kid so he can give it a dumb haircut? - Hey, we can just take that money and replace that one. - Ooh! - That is not happening. - How 'bout this... We put it with the other toys. If no kid picks it up, then we sell it, and the proceeds go towards upgrading the station. Like with a Christmas party. - Hey, sounds good! - I don't know, guys. - I'll take that, Luce. - Give me the doll, Andy! - We'll sell it! - It's worth 15 grand! - Give it back! - It's for the... - Give me the doll! - Just look at yourselves. You are everything that's wrong with Christmas. Fighting over a doll. Who's not even that hot. I'll remember this when I fill out your evaluations. Hope you all enjoy getting lumps of coal in your stockings. - Whew! Tell you what, if we don't inject some comfort and joy into Cap, we're all gonna take it up the chimney this year. - We need a Christmas miracle. - You said it. - Things were lookin' mighty grim for our firefighters. They needed to lift Captain Penisi's holiday spirits... and fast. And what about that valuable doll? I mean, shit, talk about an ethnical conundrum. Ha. I don't envy Andy, Lucy, Ike, or Granny. I wonder how it'll all work out. - You know, guys, $15,000 split three ways is a lotta money! It's like 4 grand a guy. - No, it's exactly $5,000. - Whatever. - Can you not do math? - Yes, I can do math. I just can't do math and wink at the same time. - What are you winkin' for? - Just sayin'... It's a lotta money, boys, it's almost like between 4 and 5 grand apiece. - It's not between that. - It's $5,000 exactly. - Spilt three ways, evenly. We'll figure out the exact numbers later. Hey! - What are we gonna do about Cap? How do you inject the Christmas spirit into someone who hates Christmas? - We need to remind him what Christmas is really all about. - Hey, how we lookin'? Are we gonna break the Toy Drive record this year? - I bet we get 300 families this year. - That's why we do it. Spreading the Christmas spirit, right? Yeah! - Speaking of which, we got a family coming over here. Their Christmas tree caught on fire. Burnt down half their house. - Oh... - Burnt up all the presents for their kid. So we're gonna let the little fellow come over here and pick out some toys. It's gonna be a beautiful moment. - That sounds really Christmassy. - Are you guys thinking what I'm thinking? - I think... so? - Oh, shh, here he is. - Okay. What do you want? - We know you're busy, but we wanted you to witness this beautiful display of Yuletide generosity. - And goodwill to the less fortunate. - And tidings of great joy. - And tidings... Shepherds flocked to... - Okay. - Here we go, guys. - Ooh! - Oh, for the less fortunate, you said. - Maybe it's a rental. - Oh, boy. The kid from the well. It's Hunter. - What's up, losers? No such things as Santa, tubby. Sorry about the fire. - Oh, thank you. You know, it's been so hard on Hunter commuting to the lake house these last few days. - Lake house. Do they know how the fire started? - Oh, it was Hunter. Yeah, he put an M-80 in a decorative angel. - Whew! Kids! - It's gonna get hard. - Yeah. - 'Sup, troll doll? You wanna fight? - I... don't wanna fight a child. - These toys suck. - Well, I didn't make 'em. - I guess I could wrap this in tinfoil and throw it in the microwave. - No, no, no, no. - Look how stupid it is. It's worthless on the collectible circuit. - Don't crush the box! Please don't crush the box! - Hey, this baby cries, so you could take it and you could set it on fire or throw it off a roof or eat it. - Whatevs. I'm out. Peace! Come on, Mom! I'm hungry! Now! - Okay, honey! Thank you for your generosity! - Hey. - You're welcome, ma'am. - Wow, you guys, that was beautiful. Warms the cockles of my heart. Don't bother me again. - Knock, knock. Hey, I need your finger. - Why, you gonna try and make me fart? - Ha ha, good one. Come on, let's go. - Oh, I see. I have to stop what I'm doing to help you wrap a gag gift for your dumb Yankee Swap? - It's not a gag gift. It's an awesome gift. And don't ask me to tell you what it is, 'cause I'm not gonna do it. It's a bidet. - It shoots water up your butt? - Yeah. It's a Sunny Tunnel Bidet. Vicky got me one last month... Changed my life. There is nothing more soothing that shooting warm water up your hoo-hoo. And my toilet paper bills? Never been lower. This baby pays for itself. - What are you, in the pocket of Big Bidet? - I started out at 85 degrees and then I lowered it to a nice 82 degrees. Mmm. That's the sweet spot. - That's absurd... the human rectum cannot differentiate between 85 and 82 degrees. - My rectum can tell the different. - No, it can't! Assholes don't have feelings. Get out of my office. - Merry Christmas, Edward Penisi. - There's glitter everywhere from your Goddamn ribbon! - We have to find a way to help Cap. - Hey, how 'bout this? 20 years ago at Christmas, Cap delivered a baby when a woman was stuck in traffic. What if we found that kid, brought him to the station, then we have a heartwarming Christmas reunion. - That's a really good idea. - I bet you anything Granny's trying to cut Lucy in on a two-way deal to get that Darla doll. - You're being paranoid, man. That's not what they're... - Wait a sec. Are you teaming up with them? Are you trying to cut me outta the score? - You need to calm down. - No, you need to calm down. - You're jumpier than a Pepper Jack's whore right now. You need to reel it in! - Hey, guys. Granny has a great idea. - Does it involve waiting until I fall asleep and then smothering me with a pillow to take that Darla doll? - Damn it, Andy, no! - Granny thinks that if we can find the baby that Cap delivered 20 years ago, it might just warm his icy little heart. - That's a great idea! - It was a good idea. Turns out the kid got nailed on various narcotic charges and then fled to Sweden to join a doomsday cult. - Look at that... in Sweden they call it a "duumsdoy kolt." - Cap wouldn't know what the kid looked like 20 years from now... We could just get any dude to come in here and pretend to be that baby. - Lucy McConky. That's a good idea. - Lucy McConky's biggest fault is her refusal to show proper respect when addressing her captain. - Uncle Eddie! Get your ass down here. It's a Christmas miracle! - Here he is. - Who? Who he? - Him! He who you delivered as a baby when his mom was stuck in traffic, remember? - Captain Penisi, great to see you again. Mark Budmartin. - You're the... little Budmartin baby? Well, look at you. You're all grown up! My God! What are you doin' here? - Well, sometimes I... get into a real bad funk during the holidays. - I do too. - This morning, I found myself standing on the edge of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge looking down, thinking about cashing in. - Oh... - But then I thought, "Firefighter Penisi risked his life "in the middle of traffic to bring me into this world. I can't let him down!" So I got off that bridge, and the first thing I did was buy a scratch-off lottery ticket, and guess what. - What? - I won $100,000, which I'm going to use to go to astronaut school and be the first man on Mars! - Oh! - I wrote that part. - Yeah, no shit. - Seeing you here today makes me truly believe that you made a huge mistake. - A... what's that now? - Yeah. You really should have jumped. - Wha... - Get lost... loser. - Son of a bitch, Cap. - How could you do that? - That was the boy you brought into this world, as far as you know! - Do you really think I wouldn't know that the baby I delivered fled to Sweden and joined a "duumsdoy kolt"? - Oops. - I was gonna let you off easy on those evaluations. But after that, I'm cranking it up full blast. - No! - Cap... Astronaut school, dude? - Who knew that he would keep such close tabs on the baby he delivered? - Huh. Hey, guys. Where's the Darla doll? - What do you mean? - What? - We put it right here, and now it's gone. So which one of you took it? - Don't look at me. I'm the one that wanted to give it away. - So that means one of you took the doll. - That's exactly what the real doll thief would say, Granny. - Which is precisely what the actual doll thief would say, Andy! - What? - Which is undoubtedly what the true doll thief would say, Ike. - Me?! - Yeah, you. - Obviously! - No, it ain't! - You guys! What happened to the Christmas spirit? - The deal was we were gonna split that doll three ways! That's over 4 grand each! - 5 grand. - I want that doll on the table in three minutes. - I want it in 30 seconds. - Damn it, I didn't take it! - I didn't take it either! - Liar! - Well, if that ain't a heapin' pile of humbug stew, I don't know what is. What are the odds that the Eddie and the Darla doll situations would hit their lowest points at the exact same time? Ah, what a world. I sure hope they can still fix this. - Hey, guys. Time for the Yankee Swap. - But what about Uncle Eddie? - Look, I have been trying to shove Christmas cheer down that guy's throat for 25 years... He's too far gone. Come on, it's Christmas Eve! How 'bout I read "'Twas the Night Before Christmas"? You love when I do that. - It just doesn't feel right without Uncle Eddie here. - You're right. But what else can we do? - Yeah. Ohh. - Cap, we know you hate Christmas, but we want you to join us for the Gift Swap. - You think that'll get you a good evaluation? Bah! - Eddie, the Yankee Swap is a station event, and you're gonna join us. And that's an order! - Let the swap begin! - I got number one. - Ah! - Oh! - Yeah! - You know what, sometimes that's good. - He briefed me. First is worst. - Ah... - Not all the time. - Uh... whoa. Two tickets to Seattle/ Arizona, 50-yard line. - Whoa! - Wow. - Whose gift is this? Who did this? - I danced this corporate gig and I hit it off with the owner's wife, so... - I can't wait for one of you guys to snag these away from me. - Hey, you never know, though... I'm next! Yoink! Cool! Chubby's Exotic Dance Emporium... One VIP lap dance. Not sure I need this, but... No, no, it's good for research. - I know how this works, Ike. - No, I'm keepin' it. - Okay. - Oh, look, I'm next. This one looks fun. "One free depilation at Alohair Beauty Salon." - Get it over with, then. That's your family business. - What're you talking about? Merry Christmas. Who's next? - Let me show you dum-dums how to pick a real gift. - That's a good one. - A Nightmare Manor Annual Pass. I was banned from the premises for two years, but it's still a good gift. - Okay, okay. - I'm gonna go with this red box. Sweet... moustache wax. This'll be great for when I have a boyfriend with a moustache. - Okay, thank you, guys. I know what you're doin' here. Thank you. - Yay! - Hold on. Santa has not yet had his turn. If I were to survey the other gifts that were available to me, I'm... going to take... this one. - You kidding me? - 50-hard line! Hee hee hee hee! - Chief. - Dad. - Well, Merry Christmas, buddy. - Okay, well... - Wait, wait, Cap. Shouldn't you open your gift? - I know what it is. It's a bidet... because Christmas is all about taking it in the pooper. Some Santa you are. - Cap, I'm sorry. - Dad, why did you do that? - 50-yard line! I mean, really, it's a Yankee Swap... get over it. - Man... - The nicest thing I can say about Granfield Smith is that he wraps hose with the grace and speed of a pregnant water buffalo. And that... finishes it. "Clean in comfort." Sunny Tunnel Bidet. Hmm. Eh, why not? Here goes nothing. Ooh! Ooh hoo hoo hoo ooh! Ha ha ha ha ha! - And in that moment, feeling the soothing rush of 82-degree toilet water on his bitter and hardened anus, Eddie Penisi's heart grew 20 sizes that night. I love it! - I'm too old for this shit. - What was I thinking? These people are my family. But there's no time to do those evaluations over again. Is there? You there, boy, what time is it? Almost 5:00 in the morning! - 5:00? There might just be enough time! What are you doing running around at 5:00 on Christmas morning? - Stealing packages off people's doorsteps! - Wait... Hunter, is that you? - Ah, fuck off! - Ha ha ha. Merry Christmas, Hunter. Merry Christmas. - Whatever. - Oh, something smells good. - It smells like Christmas. - It is Christmas, dummy. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, guys. - Whoa! - It looks amazing! - Holy... - Merry Christmas, everyone. - Whoa! What happened here? - A Christmas miracle. And here's the cherry on top of the yule log. Check out your stockings. - Oh! - Aw, man! - Did you do all this? - I did. - Our evaluations! - "Granfield Smith wraps hose with the speed and grace of a gazelle"? - "Andy Myawani... more like dandy guy with two Mommies"? - It was 5:00 in the morning. - Ike Crystal. "Satisfactory. Satisfactory..." Satisfactory on every one! Thanks, Cap! - What caused the change of heart, Cap? - Well, Lucy, I realized it was selfish of me to tarnish your records because I had the holiday blues. - Or maybe somebody used his new Christmas gift. - You're right, Chief. Your gift taught me a lot last night. Turns out, assholes do have feelings. I know this asshole does. - Aw... - Aw ha ha ha. - Wait a minute. Did you know the bidet was gonna have this effect on Cap? - It looks like there's a new Santa Claus around here. Or should I say... Old Taint Nick? - Man, the only thing that'd make this day better is if one of you admitted to stealing that Darla doll. - I didn't take it, Andy! - No worries, gentlemen. 'Cause I know who did it. - What? Who? Seriously? - Follow me. - Why can't you just tell us now? Go... boom. - Whoa! So this whole time it's been Mark Budmartin? - The actor who played Mark Budmartin. - I knew that guy was a phony! - I'm sorry for accusing you. - Aw, man, it's okay. - I'm sorry too, fellas. - Take it in. - Are you guys ready for the genuine Christmas miracle? That is not the real Darla doll. - I think it is. - This is the real Pubic Defender Darla. When I saw how weird you guys were being about it, I swapped her out for another Darla. Merry $15,000 Christmas to us! - You're kidding, right? - What? I saved Christmas. - Why don't you read this? - Right here. - What does it say? "Pubic Defender Darla doll. M-I-P." What's MIP mean? - Mint In Package. It means it's an untouched doll in the original package. That doll right there is without original package. - How much is it worth W-O-O-P? - $122. - Well, then we're gonna spend that $122 on sugar plums and peppermint bark. - Yay! - Good for you, Cap! - Merry Christmas, Cap. And God bless us... every one. - Yeah! - Yeah! - Merry Christmas, ho ho ho. - Who's been good this year? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. I like you guys. Happy holidays. Merry Christmas. Hey... 314 families. That's a new record! - Awesome! - Hey guys, come on over. Chief's gonna read his poem. - Yay! - Yeah ha ha ha! Okay, guys. "'Twas the night before Christmas at Tacoma FD. "What a year it has been, filled with whimsy and glee. Chief Terry banned gambling, but it went on, however." - No it did not, no it did not. - Not really. - "While a fire in Dildo Town brought enemies together. "Eddie's dad paid a visit and was nice only to Lucy. "The guys on the C team turned out to be douchey. - Big time. - "Cap joined the Fire Choir by using his lips, and Nightmare Manor "gave Granny a case of the yips. - Ha, that was so funny! - Man, I had to lawyer up. - "Low voice Lucy sounded like Barry White. "And Ike's brother needed help "'cause his sperm count was light. - He was havin' a tough time. - "Cap grew his hair an incredible length "while a stray bolt of lightning gave Andy super strength." - Wait, wait, wait... When did that happen? - I'm just making sure you're awake. - Ha ha, that didn't happen! - "At the Firemen's Ball the elevator was stuck." - I don't remember that. - "And this holiday season, Eddie learned to give a fuck." - Thanks to you guys. - That's right. - So as we wrap up our tale and we ride out of sight... - Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Ain't that right, Darla? - You said it, Snowman! - Station 24, man stuck in chimney. Please respond. - All right, here we go guys!
