 Jane by Design (2012): Season 1, Episode 2 - The Runway - full transcript 
 Jane is thrown for a loop when Gray assigns her the last-minute task of getting the new accessories line ready for the Spring Preview Party. Jane is pretty sure she has bit off more than she can chew, but with Jeremy looking to make amends, the two team-up to guarantee the line is one that critics and buyers won't soon forget. Meanwhile, Nick leverages his knowledge of Billy's secret relationship with Lulu to get advice on approaching Jane. When Nick asks her to the Winter Formal, Jane thinks life couldn't get any better. But when she realizes the Winter Formal is the same night as the Spring Preview Party, her two perfect nights become her worst nightmare.

 That me, Jane, my life is a little complected right now. I'm ledding the way for my fashion dream working for her, Gary Cherry-Marry. The only problem? They think that i'm an adult. Now i'm jeggling two secret lifes, One in high-school, and one in high fashion. Previously on Jane by Design... Ben, the job search, it's... Your big brother has it handled. I don't know, Jane. You'd have to sign up for the career internship program. You'd be sacrificing a huge part of your high school experience. it's not like I'm at the center of the social universe around here as it is.

 What is this? Sneaking around for the past three months. I don't get it. You've forbidden me from telling a soul. I like you, Billy. I have to do something. They're going to take our house. Gray will be with you in a minute. And good luck. I average an assistant or two a month. You make it a week, I'll be shocked. And that is India Jourdain, Associate Designer. Directly beneath Gray. That weasel is after my job. And I am not going out without a fight. Starting salary is 34,000. I'll take it.

 JANFamed fashion icon Yves Saint Laurent once said that elegance is forgetting what one is wearing. Considering the week I'm about to have, I sure hope he was right. Have a good day! I was gonna eat that. I need you to drive. It's not even 8:00 and I already have six e-mails from Gray. Not to mention a lost earring shipment from a country that I can't pronounce. Seriously? What? You're really gonna keep up this whole double life thing? Oh, I don't know, Billy. I mean, do I continue to work at my fashion dream job, or do I return to a life of high school obscurity? What should I do? Come on, Jane. Obscurity? Little dramatic, don't you think? We're just misunderstood. Besides, aren't you a little burnt out on that whole work thing? Are you kidding? I love this. This job? It's the first thing I think about when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I think about every night. Do you have any idea what that's like? Sometimes. When Ms. Dean wears that scholastically inappropriate sweater on Fridays, for instance. I mean, I guess that feeling might be a little different, though. Yeah. Charming. We're still not driving. And for the record, that sweater is age inappropriate. That woman should be teaching Ill-fitting Attire 101. I'd take that class. I'm sure you would. What do you say, Janey? This Saturday? A night out in the city? Come on. It'll be magical. Well, I definitely in a tux. So... ee you I'm in. You found it? Thank you so, so much! You totally saved my... No, of course. I'll be there soon. I'm... I'm on my way! Hey, Jane. Oh! Hi. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you! We have a situation, Janet. Turns out no one liked your little presentation last week after all. Turns out they loved it. Congratulations. You're kidding me! I don't kid. She doesn't kid. No, I know. Thank you, Gray. But really, it was all you. Of course it was me. Of course. Problem is, they loved it so much they've decided to launch it at the fashion preview. The what? Preview party. This Saturday. Behind you. It's where we show our upcoming line to potential investors and publishers. This is great! No. It's terrible. Terrible. Right. I can't get back in time to get that line ready for that preview party. She cannot get back. And if that line is not beyond perfection... Perfection. Well, with India after my job, I certainly can't expect her to handle things. Definitively not. If only there were someone... Someone that I could depend on. Someone like... You. Me? Is that a problem? No. It's just... You know, I sort of have plans this Saturday night and... Never mind. No, no, no. Um, I'll cancel. Are you sure you can do it? Yes. I'm sure. I can do it. Do you think she can do it, Stefano? I do. Excellent. I think. I am so in over my head. I've never even been to a fashion preview, let alone prepped a line for one. You'll be fine, Jane. Look, it's a huge opportunity. But one you can totally handle. One that many of us would've jumped at the chance to have. Look, you can't pass this up. And you're gonna do great. You really think so? Absolutely! Okay. I can do this. I can do this, right? You can't not do it. Of course you can. Thanks, guys. She's toast. Bye-bye, Jane. Are you even listening to me? Pay close attention. Or I will kill you in your sleep. I said obsidian beads! She's so scary! She's hideous! I've been looking for you all day. That's nice. I had a good time the other night with you, getting to know you, Jane. I was thinking you and I should go on a proper date though, yeah? Mmm, I don't think so. Are you all right? I'm great. I just... I gotta go. Whoa, whoa, back up a sec. You actually like this guy? No. Yeah. A little, I guess. I don't know. But that was before I saw him all up in India Jourdain's business the other night. Just how up in her business was he? Billy, please. Don't perv out on me. This is about my job. Yeah. The job that's leaving me flying solo at the dance Saturday. I know. I'm sorry. I just... I'll call you back. Hey. I'm golf. Not tennis. Yeah, I know, I just... I want to talk to you about something. Sorry. No, I can't help you there, man. I'm not into that stuff. No. Not... What? That was my brother, Tommy. He got fired last summer. I don't want any trouble, okay? That's not what I want to talk to you about. I was wondering about Jane. You guys are close, right? Yeah? So? So, I, uh... Look, man, you're not making this easy. I was just... Are you guys... You know. She's my best friend. And I'm not gonna let her get screwed over by some meathead jock who hasn't given her the time of day since middle school. Okay? Um, if you'll excuse me, some of us have to earn a living around here. "Meathead jock. " Hmm. This one is interesting. I know. It's terrible. That's not what I said. You didn't have to. I wish I could help you out, but Jeremy's got me prepping the line. Honestly, Carter. I am completely inexperienced. I have no idea why Gray would give me something this important to do. Um, maybe because she trusts you? Hmm? Thanks? You'll be fine, Jane. Awesome. Hello, Jane. Go on. You can say it. You're overthinking things a bit. What do you mean? This event, it's just a little preview for the money people. And the money people want to feel like their money is safe. And while the work you've done here is all very, very good, it's certainly not safe. Well, I'm not quite finished yet. I just... Oh, oh. Of course not. I'm sure you'll do just fine. Good luck. Afternoon, Judge. You're late. Sorry about that, sir. Hey, Lulu. You two know each other? Not really. He goes to my school. Daddy, if it's okay, I think I'It wait inside. I'm not really in the mood for golf today. That's not like you. Quitting before we even tee off. I'm not quitting. I just... I don't feel like playing today, okay? Okay. You gave me the wrong club. Uh, I'm pretty sure I... I know you, don't I? Nutter, isn't it? Yeah, you've been in my courtroom a few times. My brother. Not me. That's... That's not me. Uh-huh. Not yet. Lucky shot. Is that what you want? To be in design? Because that has potential. Thanks. Did I do something to offend you, Jane? Because if I did... No. Of course not. I just, um... I really should get back to work now. Hey. Can you explain American women to me? I wish I could, dude. Forget it. I can see you, Jeremy. India! What a nice surprise! Are you avoiding me, Jeremy? No! No, of course not. Good. Because I was thinking tonight after work we could get together and... Look. India. You and I? The past few months... It's not... Well, it's not really... Look, you're... Yeah? Is it me or is it hot in here? Just, uh... What were you saying, Jeremy? Your place, or mine? It's classic and simple and... Safe and expected. Exactly. This is sad. This is my fault. I put way too much on you. I just thought... I thought I could call in and do a simple top edit. I thought you were ready, but... No, no. I am ready. I am. "Safe and simple. " The preview party is in less than two days, Janet. Oh, it's Jane. And this collection needs to be perfect. It needs to be fresh. It needs to turn heads. And this is not that collection. You know what? It's all right. I'll call in India and have her redo it in the morning and then... Wait. Um... Just let me take another shot. Please. Are you sure? Yes. I can do it. All right. Start over. Thank you, Gray. You better not let me down, Janet. Now I have to go. I'm gonna be late for dinner. Right, Patricia? Absolutely. The cocktails are waiting. Mmm! Hi, Janet. Hi. Bye, Janet. Bye. See you at the preview party. Back to the drawing board. Hi. What do you want? I want to talk to you. Really? 'Cause I thought we didn't even know each other. I was just trying to throw him off. Well, you threw me off. Come on, Billy. You know my dad would freak out if he thought there was something going on between us. You know how he is. Yeah. He's an ass. He's tough. And overprotective. But that's only because he wants what's best for me. And what is it that you want, Lu? You. Yeah... I want you. And they thinks i have dentiondho, which is flattering, yeah, but... What's with you this morning? Billy? What? What's going on with you? Nothing. Jane, it's nothing, okay? I just... I'll see you later. What? You're really gonna make me say it? Come on, man. Now you wanna talk, huh? Did you tell anyone? Tell 'em what? What you saw. With me and Lulu. Look, I don't care what or who you do, all right? I just... I don't get it. Guy like you with a girl like Lulu Pope? I'm surprised you haven't told everyone in town. It's her. She's the one who doesn't want everyone to know. Why would you agree to something like ththat? Look, are you gonna tell anyone, or not? Not. But I do want a favor in return. He seems like an okay guy. I hate these things. Focus, Jane. Nick Fadden. Crap. It's Gray. Again. I'm telling you, Billy. If I don't get this line ready in time for Saturday's show, it's over. Can you please focus on the conversation at hand? You mean the conversation about the high school Adonis that I've been drooling over for the past five years? That conversation? Yes. Thank you. Remember the time that Lulu invited me to a sleepover in fourth grade? She gave me the wrong address! I showed up to a Cluck Shack with my sleeping bag and my Malibu Barbie, ready to go, and there wasn't a soul in sight. It was humiliating. All because I allowed myself to believe, for one minute, that they could ever treat us like one of them. And this? This feels a little bit like that. You think I'm pranking you? Of course not. It's... It sounds too good to be true, okay? Nick is gorgeous and popular and I can barely complete sentences around him. Besides, you hate those guys. Why do you even care? I don't. And why would he talk to you about it, of all people? I don't know. Maybe he's, like, nervous or something? In a town full of rich jocks, Nick is the richest and jockiest of them all. And I am Little Orphan Annie who gawks at him every day in AP English. Why would he be nervous about me? What? Nothing. Look, as much as I would love to talk about Nick Fadden all day, every day, for the rest of time, I have a fashion line to prep for in less than four days. I have to go! Where are you, Gray? Hmm. This is what she does. Hangs you out there. All alone. Succeed or die. You aren't the first. Or the last. The faces are different, but the stories are all the same. Megan. Oh, poor Megan. One ill-timed layover for Gray in Morocco and Megan was gone. Then there was Alexander. He lasted three whole days. Until he made the huge mistake of confusing burgundy with magenta. You think Gray's having you put together this line because she wants you to succeed? Sweetie, think again. Why would I listen to you? You want me to fail. True. But don't say I didn't warn you. Then what did he say? We've gone over it 50 times. He asked about Jane. That's it. Why? Lulu. I told you Jane is off-limits, okay? Fine. Whatever. As long as Nick promised he wouldn't tell. He promised, right? Yes. Are you sure? I guess. You guess? This is serious, Billy! Nobody can know about this. Ever. You're right. And you don't have to worry about it anymore because there's nothing left to tell. It's over. Looks like you could use a hand. I'm fine, thanks. Okay, you're right. I could definitely use some help. And I have help to give. What are the chances? All right. Let's have it. What've you got so far? Well, I think I've figured out the first five combinations. And this one? I know. I just... You know, I keep going back and forth on the necklace. I like it. It's just a bit expected. But we'll get there. It's perfect. You did it. We did it. I mean, from "I like you" to "I can hardly look at you" in less than a week? I demand an explanation. I guess I'm in a buy American sort of mood. Jane Quimby, you are breaking my heart. Hardly. Whoa. Uh... You have a girlfriend. A what? You're with somebody. No. Oh, come on. I saw you. And India the other night. That? No, no, no. India and I are absolutely 100% over. Right. You know, it didn't look very over from where I was standing. Which was right over there, just in case you were curious. It was... You know what? I'd actually rather not talk about it. It wasn't what it looked like. All right, it was exactly what it looked like, but you and I, Jane, we could have something special. Are you laughing? "We could have something special. " That bad, was it? It was kind of corny. Corny? Mmm-hmm. You know, this could seriously damage my reputation as a ladies' man? A ladies' man? I also like "chick magnet. " That's a nice one. Because I'm a magnet for chicks. Hello? What? Billy, slow down, I can't hear you. I'll be ready in two minutes. Great. Ben. I have school. Jane. I have an interview. Best of three? Fine. That's what I'm talking about. Right there. Very mature, Ben. What can I say? I try. You know. You got a letter. It's by the couch. Yo. Why aren't you dressed yet? We're gonna be late for school. Jane? Janey? What's wrong? Talk to me. It's my first paycheck. We're rich! Hey. Hey, Ben. Good shower? Yeah, it was. It was a real nice shower. Thanks. You two are getting weirder. Ben Quimby? Did we have another meeting scheduled for today? Nope, but it's nice to see you, Rita Shaw. Notice I remembered your name this time. You do realize you're not allowed to just show up and hang out whenever you want on school grounds, right? I have an interview. An interview? For what? A job. A job here? Yeah, assistant athletic director. Perfect, right? You know, if this works out, we'll end up being colleagues. How great is that? Great. Mr. Quimby. Okay, that's me. Here goes nothing. Wish me luck, Rita Shaw. Good luck? Man, I don't get it. I mean, she used to look at me like I was God's gift or something And now, it's like... I'm a leper. Maybe her taste has evolved. Look, I know you don't want to see Jane get hurt, but I'm not this... What was it again? Meathead jock. Right. I'm not that guy. The guy you think I am. What do you care what I think, man? Yeah, I don't know. I'm not gonna say anything about what I saw, you and Lulu. I mean, no matter what happens with Jane, I wouldn't do that. Here's the thing about Jane. She's smart and she's beautiful and she's amazing. And she has no idea. Just talk to her. That's it. That's all it takes. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. So, I was wondering if you were gonna be there Saturday. Uh, yeah, totally. Saturday. What's Saturday again? Oh, the, uh... The dance. Oh, right. Magical night. I was thinking maybe we could meet there? You want to meet me? Yeah. You. Oh. Great. It's a date! I mean, you know, metaphorically speaking. Not like a real date. Just like, you know, you're gonna be there and I'll be there. So we'll meet there together. I'll see you Saturday, Jane. Yes, yes, you will! Or you won't. What exactly is the problem? The problem, Billy, is that Winter Formal is the same night as the fashion preview. And I already told you. I cannot miss that party. Gray is counting on me and I refuse to give India Jourdain the satisfaction of watching me fail. Then skip the dance. You already bailed on me once this week. What's the big deal? Are you kidding? Nick Fadden said, "Meet you there. " He wants to meet me there. At the dance. So, you know, I have to go. So? What do you think? That you can't be in two places at once, Janey. That's what I think. Oh, no, no. I know that look. I have a plan. Yep. That's the look. Look, Winter Formal here. Preview party here. I'm really not following. Oh, come on, Billy. I couldn't have planned it better if I tried. I'll just take a spin around the dance floor, quick change in the bathroom, and then race over in time to prep for the fashion preview. Back and forth a few times... Win the guy. Impress the boss. What could possibly go wrong? Exactly. It's all going to work out. And I'm going to be awesome. Where'd you get that thing? Oh, wow, that was... Mom's. She was wearing it in that old picture, right? The one dad had in his wallet. Mmm-hmm. He would be really proud of you, you know? Yeah. He would. Come on, let's see it! You look... Incredible. Rocking the fauxhawk formal style, are we? Hey, if you got it, flaunt it. What... Okay, can we go now? Please. Bye. What? I'm nervous. Don't be. I've got your back, kid. Showtime. Maybe this is a mistake. Trust me, Janey. This isn't some grade school sleepover prank. Not tonight. He wanted to see you. You know where to find me. I'm glad you're here, Jane. Me, too. You know, I am so lucky. I get to dance with the prettiest girl here. That's nice. It's just... Why now? I mean, you've barely said more than the occasional "hey, Jane" since Bobby Connor's seventh grade pool party. You know, the incide. You. Me. Seven minutes in heaven. That was you? I mean, that was you. Of course. And it was very memorable. Obviously a high point for you. Well, I have been reliving those... Seven minutes. Over and over throughout the years. You don't remember a thing, do you? Nope. Look, I'm sorry. It's okay. I was 13 and there wasn't much to remember. It's... It's because you seem different. You asked why now, and that's why. You just seem... I don't know, just different lately. I don't know. I've just been racivg back and forth between... Shoot. You okay? Um, yeah. I just... Um, I have to go. To the bathroom. But I'll be right back! I thought you'd never show. Wait. Wait up! There you are. We've got less than an hour. All right, let's get to work. Hi. Hey! I've been looking all over for you. Where've you been? Oh, just mingling around. Hi, Nick. Hey. You guys know Jane, right? Of course we do. We do? They're just jealous. Can we dance or something? I'd like that. Explain that to me. Maybe he got hit in the head with a baseball or something? Let's go! Hold still. Do it. Do what? Zip me! The line goes on the runway in less than five minutes. I have to get back. What would I do without you? Jane! You're in the wrong... Dress. Gray? India. You're back. For now. I know what you're up to. You best take your eyes off my job. I don't know what your assistant told you, but... Oh, please. You're about as subtle as Galliano's fall collection. Little word of advice. I wouldn't bite off more than I can chew. Are we clear? Mmm-hmm. Good. Now, where's Janet? Janet? Who's... Oh, please. I'll find her. Where've you been? They're going on now and you're... What is that? What? That! This? This is an outfit change. It's cute, right? It's quite gorgeous. Whose is it? It's mine. Yeah, who designed it? Oh. Me, I guess. I designed it. I need you two! Pronto! We've got some serious fashion fallout happening back here! It's ruined. Oh! Now what? I'm one dress short. We cannot send this line out incomplete. Guys? Seriously, what are you looking at? The nerve it takes. Putting your own design on the runway. Actually, I... You know what I think? I think I was wrong about you. I think you might be cut out for the fashion business after all. See you in the office, Jane. She knows my name. She actually knows my name. Congratulations. You pulled it off. Amazing! I have to go! Synced By YesCool www.addic7ed.com
