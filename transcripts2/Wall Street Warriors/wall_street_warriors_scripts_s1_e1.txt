wall street brought is a New York Stock Exchange for what is wall street in the water heaters science its the biggest financial market in the world the silence on the morning and yet shown Lord highly competitive waste extraordinarily intelligent people there's a lot of competition and you need to do everything stay ahead of the pack how to 21 months we've had one down one and we would like to not

grail how do you say Lois risk and highs for coming out it do smoke during the final live right here years American Stock Exchange were in 1987 as everyone knows market crash on a Monday afternoon as I was standing doing my job in morning trading that you see below me or brokers who was trying to get attention another broker actually bit me on the shoulder because I was in his wife I stood there stunned it's a true story dusts supply to the heart this book is for me to explore it what i do. represent on one side some the richest investors on the planet and on the other side we try to find undiscovered managers so we hope could be the next superstar it's an art discovering somebody's managers because for the most part they like remain below the radar I would say nine out of 10 gonna fail his only go so far we've gone over a short sale love though I did the service go sit down with my trainer and we we go through what we have in the book and what do we think sworn in any city today do you want to add to positions do you want to cut positions want to wait on the ship life we want to wait for them to open and stabilize something hard I'm even bernsen Bali on those it was horrible also it is a no go from now here on the other hand check our struggle on that and see whether can't no have to sometimes for that's why I'm show is something is saltwater risk in the market right now so we're going to be very very careful about what he do if I could talk to trading a fair trade and guide it was on to it as well the way to do it I want to open stabilize we've got two minutes you gonna be here for the time being weekend user with all that markets open what's gonna happen is you have a flood warning anybody was short yesterday and brother and follow through my being honest so what you end up with his a very funky moving the very beginning today you should I reprise Rhino it's all over the place you wanna getting at those positions on supply line right now when he is working on a traitor you'll never get his attention and he's just has a laser focus and he'll remain in these positions until he takes his pound of flesh and the market home okay problem all retiring means is that you don't happen to work hundred-point and the secret shoe that is creating enough assets for you to support yourself non I work at a consumer sector focus has fun I loved you

fun there's a lot of things that have to happen yeah a strategy and you basically have to build the team before your business day one investor giving you money they expect you to start performing they too another guy was on for us is the primary CEO the last time some ass I'm sure right now we are closing on acting because we're worried about the new guys resignation count him at the picky I think when you are a company and you're trying so hard to that play in making making a product and you see how all the analysts are betting on whether or not the company is going to be right around I'd rather be the company's action making something and being the Weasley analyst whose actually predicting with an upcoming think maybe and I don't see we think it may be that way but yes sometimes I feel that it more honest to be the on this is not a great party but scratch all that scratch scratch I rugby the person's actually making it happen verses you betting what that means gonna go up or down the nefarious image that short sellers are betting on destruction and lawsuits well said and we don't want to have people profiting from other peoples lost there some countries the don't allow shorts on France you can short sell it for us I think that's really short-sighted short-selling serves a really important Kabul purpose short sellers are often ferreting out information other companies are trying to hide what's the deal with the possible a file on this is too slow who cofo there and you think he's confident a healthy market is one where information is broadly disseminated
