 [NARRATOR] In search of their sixth Dragon Ball, our three adventurers, Bulma, Goku and Oolong, now make their way toward Fire Mountain, the legendary home of a terrible giant: the Ox-King. How much longer until we get there? Not long enough! [BULMA] Are you still scared of that silly, old legend? [BULMA] It's not real, you know. I mean, listen to yourself! [BULMA] Seriously, how could a whole mountain really be on fire? [OOLONG] Great! I'm stuck with a couple of non-believers.

 Well, you just wait until you see it for yourselves! [BULMA] I gotta admit it is getting hotter all of a sudden! [panting] Look at the sunset! Is it ever bright! Oh, wow! Eww. I gotta brush my teeth... [OOLONG] That isn't the sun, you idiots, that's Fire Mountain! No way! I can't believe it! Better ease back, my friend. We don't want to be spotted just yet. [PUAR] Right! [SHU] In a way, I'm glad we're almost there, but in a way, I'm not. [MAI] How're we going to tell Pilaf we didn't get the Dragon Balls?

 [SHU] I don't know. I'm scared. Yeah, just once I'd like to hear that little mutant encourage us with words of appreciation. You mean like "Shu, Mai, just relax! Some failures are to be expected in the spy business!" You are too kind, oh wise Emperor! Let's face it, Shu, our goose is cooked! Guess I'd better update my will. [MAI] I just hope he hasn't installed his new "Do-It-Yourself Torture Chamber" yet. So, in other words, you have failed me once again! You could put it that way, sire. Yes, I guess you could say that. Well, this is the spy business. Some failures are to be expected. So relax! Eat! Good work! You fools! You know I don't greet failure with a pat on the back! [squealing] [PILAF] You must pay for this! [giggling] [crying] [SHU] We're toast! [PILAF] Why, you imbeciles! Do you think I enjoy doing this? [giggling] [thunder] [screaming] That was a shocking experience, don't you think? Yeah, a real charge. Let's hope you two morons have learned your lesson! Well, there's Fire Mountain! [BULMA] Wow! I've never seen anything like it! [GOKU] Oohh... [BULMA] Uh-huh... [OOLONG] I don't know about you guys, but I've seen enough. [OOLONG] I'm ready to go! We have to get the Dragon Ball first, Oolong. No silly bonfire's gonna scare me away! A towering mountain engulfed in eternal flames doesn't scare you, huh? Well it scares the sausage out of me! Besides, the evil Ox-King lives there and he'll have our heads! [BULMA] I bet he's got the ball! [OOLONG] Yeah, I'm sure it's up there, probably in his castle. [OOLONG] And it's all yours. Just get past the fiercest giant in the world and pass through that wall of flames there, and then you can have it! [BULMA] Does he live up there in the castle? [OOLONG] He did, but they say even he can't pass through those flames. So then, why did he start the fire? No, no! He didn't start it, kid. He paid some magical wizard to create a fire to protect his castle from thieves, right? And then it raged out of control, and he's been stuck on the outside ever since! You sure know a lot about it! [OOLONG] I was a tour guide for the local Chamber of Commerce, okay? And I just remembered, I forgot to clock out, so, see you later, ha ha! You're the biggest coward I know! [OOLONG] Well, I know why you're not scared, you think Goku's gonna protect you! But he's no match for the Ox-King! My Grandpa taught me how to be fearless, so I'm not scared. [OOLONG] Yeah? Well I'll show you what my grandpa taught me, squirt! Hey! Let's let him get a head start! [BULMA] You get back here, you... [growling] [BULMA] Piggy! [BULMAR] Piggy! [intense diarrhea] [BULMA and GOKU] Piggy! Piggy! --[BULMA] Piggy! --[GOKU laughing] [GOKU] Piggy! Look, Yamcha! They're on the move again. You're right, Puar, and they're heading straight for Fire Mountain. I bet that means the sixth Dragon Ball is up there in the Ox-King's castle. What?! Oh, well that Dragon Ball's definitely lost! So you don't think they have a chance? [PUAR] Actually, they have two chances: slim and none! That Dragon Ball's as good as gone. Well, I suppose you're probably right, but let's stick around for the show. And just what show is that, Master? [YAMCHA] Come on, that kid Goku is so confident I imagine he'll try and take on the Ox-King. Don't you agree? Mm-hmm. I suppose so. And there you have it, my furry, little friend! We finally get a chance to watch poor, little Goku get torn limb from limb! [screaming] Huh? What?! [screaming] Oh no! Somebody help! [fleash slicing] [screaming] Gross, look what I've done! I chopped his head right off! Now I've seen everything! I don't think she even had her eyes open, do you? [crying] Hey, nice work. I was told to never talk to strangers! Hey, watch out! [GIRL screams] That girl's dangerous! All right, Puar, we've wasted enough time here already. We'd better get back on the road. That girl was real cute, Yamcha. So why didn't you get scared of her and run away? It's only girls my age that scare me. [flames roaring] I just can't stand this heat! Whoa, be quiet! If the Ox-King hears us we're dead meat, you know?! Boy, that sure is a massive fire! Well, the Dragon Ball's definitely up in the castle, but how do we get it out of there? What do you say, Goku? Do you think you can fly up there and get the Dragon Ball? [GOKU] I tried that once, and look what happened! Goku, you're crazy! [giggling] I know. Flying Nimbus! Now you've done it! The Ox-King heard that for sure! Get that Dragon Ball, Goku! Hurry back here, okay?! [flames roaring] [GOKU] Wow, it's hotter than I thought up here. Oh well, here it goes. [GOKU screaming] [whimpering] [splash] Great! The kid's just giving up! And we should do the same before we get ourselves killed! You alright there, tail? [BULMA squealing] [screaming] What're you two doing here? Who... us? We-We weren't doing anything? Don't tell me you've come to steal the treasures from my castle, huh? Have you?! [BULMA] Uh-uh! I swear we didn't even know there was a castle up there! Right Oolong? Oolong! [OOLONG] Uh-Huh! Are you lying?! [screaming] [BULMA] Goku! Power Pole, extend! It looks like it's going to be tougher than we thought getting into that castle. [OX-KING] Ah-ha! You dummy! I knew it! You're just stinking treasure hunters! [GOKU] That's not true, sir. What do you know about truth, you little thief?! [BULMA] Atta boy, Goku, keep him off balance! [BULMA] Whoo! [chuckling] It's time to get serious! Flying Nimbus! [OX-KING] Whoa! Hey! Stop that! [OX-KING] Cut it out! Urgh, this guy's a rock! Are you crazy, kid?! Get outta there! You can't beat the Ox-King! You're the Ox-King?? [OX-KING] Mm-hmm. So you're the great Ox-King everyone's been talking about. No wonder you're so strong! I know about that cloud, and you couldn't ride it if you stole it! So who gave it to you? I got it from a man who said he was a Turtle Hermit. Turtle Hermit? His name's Master Roshi. He was my old teacher! Do you know where I can find him? Hey, Bulma! Do you think we could find the place where that Turtle Hermit lives? The Ox-King wants to know. Probably. It's gotta be close to that beach we were on. Ooh, eee! I can finally go back to my castle! Oh boy, oh boy! Where did you get this little toothpick that you carry on your back, here? Oh, that's no toothpick. That's my Power Pole! Cool huh? My Grandpa gave it to me before he died. [OX-KING] Hmm. That's interesting. Was his name Gohan? [GOKU] Mm-hmm. [OX-KING] Ah-ha! Your grandpa Gohan once tried to break that toothpick on my head! You mean you and my Grandpa used to fight each other? It seems our little friend knows the Ox-King! I can't believe it, Puar! This kid is starting to bug me. Why were you and Grandpa fighting? [OX-KING] Because we were like brothers! Your grandpa was the first pupil chosen by Master Roshi, and I had the honor of being the second! Ahh, so you're Gohan's boy. Yeah! My name is Goku! That's a fine name! "Goku!" That explains why Goku is so strong! I should have been nicer to him. I hope he still wants to go find the Dragon Balls with me. All right, that's enough talk about the good old days. There's something important I want to ask of you, Goku. [GOKU] Yeah? Old Master Roshi has in his possession a very powerful fan made out of a palm leaf, called the Bansho Fan. [OX-KING] It's the only thing that will extinguish Fire Mountain. Will you use the Flying Nimbus to go to him and borrow the fan for me? Yeah, sure. And could you do something for me? Hm! Yes! Anything you ask. We're collecting these, and I think you have one. Hey! I think I've seen one in my castle! Yes, of course you can have it my new, little friend. Aw, thanks! [BULMA] Atta boy, Goku! The kid saved my bacon! I see! So that's what those Dragon Balls really look like! [PUAR] I was expecting them to be bigger. I'll be back just as soon as I can! Wait! There's something you should know! Why, just yesterday I sent my only daughter ChiChi to retrieve the Bansho Fan for me. But now I'm worried, 'cause I feel something awful has happened to her. Please, Goku. Find my ChiChi, and bring her back safely to me. ChiChi? Yes. She's a bit of a coward but--Ahh... Say Goku, how would you like to marry her? Uh... marry? [snickering] Here's a picture of ChiChi. I'll do my best to find her. Wow! All things considered, she's quite a looker! This isn't good! Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Yamcha?! Yeah, I'm dead meat if that girl's not okay! Don't you worry Mister Ox-King, I'll bring her back! Good luck, son! And be careful, Goku! [YAMCHA] Puar, the next time I try to smack the daughter of some huge giant, please, stop me! Hey, there she is! [PUAR] Uh-oh! She hasn't moved a muscle! [YAMCHA] Come on, Puar! Hey kid! Wake up! You can't be dead, please! [YAMCHA] Ahh, she's breathing Puar! She's alive! Don't shoot, ChiChi! I'm a friend! Huh? How do you know my name is ChiChi? Uh, well let's just say I'm a secret admirer of yours. I didn't want to hurt you earlier, but you left me no choice. Oh! [YAMCHA] If you really want to know the truth, my darling, I'm in love with you. Ever since I first set eyes on you. Truly. Wow! You're in love with me? Oooh! With me?! Of course! I really am! [CHICHI] Are you telling the truth? Just look into my face. Can't you see it for yourself? See? Oh my, you look funny! Is that, uh, tooth gonna grow back in? Remember the Ox-King, Yamcha! We don't want to blow this little charade! You know, you're the first boy to say that he loves me, hehe! Why does that not surprise me? Oh, boy! I wonder if papa will approve of him? I wonder if I'm even old enough to have a boyfriend?! [YAMCHA] Let's get outta here! [PUAR] Right! Oh my! This is all happening so fast! I just don't know what to think! [crying] What the... Hey, I wonder where he's going? I thought he loved me... [CHICHI] I know! He must be the shy type. [CHICHI] How romantic... Hey, are you ChiChi?? Yes I am, but I don't think I know who you are. You're the second boy today who knows my name is ChiChi. [screaming] [CHICHI] You must love me too! Well, you seem like a pretty nice person to me. [CHICHI] But I'm not even sure my papa will let me have a boyfriend yet! Well, don't worry about that, you're dad sent me here! I'm supposed to help you find Master Roshi so we can borrow the Bansho Fan! Really? That's so sweet of you. Well, hop on to my Flying Nimbus, 'cause we really should get going. You mean, I can actually ride on this thing without falling? Well, sure, but you do have to have a pure heart. Oh, that's okay! When your dad's the Ox-King you always behave well. [grunting] Need some help there? Nope. [squealing] Well, I'm up! Hey, what happened to you? Well, you grabbed my tail and I lose all my power when somebody does that. It's the only thing I just can't stand! [CHICHI] Sorry. I didn't know. Well, it seems like our amazing little friend has a weak point after all. [GOKU] Here we go! [screaming] Try to relax and stand up. Here! Take my hand! Well, what are you thinking Yamcha? Should we follow them? Don't worry about it, Puar. He's gonna have to come back to get the sixth Dragon Ball from that castle. And we'll be waiting right here for those fools. And after they get the seventh ball for us, then we'll make our move. And I'll grab that little monkey tail of his with my Wolf Fang Fist! Oh, so you are a girl! I really wasn't sure at first. You jerk! [screaming] Do you think Goku's going to find my little ChiChi? He'd better, if he knows what's good for him! Gee whiz, you didn't have to knock me off the cloud you know! Well with your manners, you'd think you just crawled out of the woods! [GOKU] Well I did! [giggling] We might never find that Turtle Hermit out in the middle of nowhere. Maybe we should stop and ask somebody for directions. Whatever you say. [giggling] Uh, what are you giggling about? Oh, about some hunk I just met. [GOKU] Is that all girls ever think about? Excuse me, can you tell me where Master Roshi lives? Master Roshi? Yeah! You just keep going in that direction and you can't miss his little island! Thank you! Bye-bye now! I've never seen a fish like that. Wow! That must be it Goku! I think you're right. Let's go see. [GOKU] Hey! Master Roshi! [ROSHI] Hello there! Hi. Hop on down, kid! I had a feeling I'd be seeing you again some day. Uh, this is the great Master Roshi? Yep. that's him. How you doin'? Good! For an old coot! [NARRATOR] Our hero has found Master Roshi, but will he be able to fan out the flames of Fire Mountain? [NARRATOR] Join us next time for Dragon Ball.
