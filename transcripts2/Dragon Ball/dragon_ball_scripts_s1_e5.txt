 [splashing] [engine humming] [NARRATOR] With only two more Dragon Balls left to find, our heroes, Goku and Bulma are heading into very dangerous territory as they continue their search. Joining them in their quest is Oolong, the perverse pig who can change his appearance at will. [engine humming] [BULMA] It was a good idea to travel down this river. We're making awesome time! That's great!

 But why is Oolong coming with us? I think she's got a thing for me, kid! I thought Oolong's special powers might come in handy. That's why he's coming along. Hey, what do you mean?! Are you tryin' to say I'm not your type? Exactly! I'm looking for tall, dark, and handsome! Just give it time, honey! You'll see, "I'm the man"! [OOLONG squealing] Hey, back off kid! I ain't that kinda pig! You were right! You are a man! Of course I'm a man, you imbecile! What more do you want? I'll take a polygraph,

 give a blood sample, just don't ever do that again! [growling] [engine humming] Hey Bulma, how much further? Well, we should almost be there by now. This map will tell us exactly. We've been driving forever already! Where in the world are we going?? We're going to a place called "Fire Mountain". Fire Mountain?! Are you crazy?! There's no way you're draggin' me anywhere near that place! [squealing] [GOKU] What's so scary about a mountain? For starters, the place is always on fire, and it's the home of the terrible Ox-King! Do you understand now? That bad, huh? [OOLONG] Mm-hmm. [BULMA] Relax, Oolong. Goku's strong enough to take care of some old "ox". [OOLONG] I don't know about that. I've heard the Ox-King is the strongest guy in the whole world! They say he's over ten feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. And he's always on the prowl for anyone who might try to climb up the mountain to get to his castle. He carries a giant battle axe, and let me tell you, he knows how to use it too! He's been terrorizing the countryside for years, and they say that if you meet the Ox-King, there's only one thing you can do: Run! 'Cause if he catches you, you'll get a really "close shave"! You really heard that? [OOLONG] Uh-huh! [GOKU] Sounds like the guy's not very happy. [OOLONG] Exactly! He's radically unhappy! Well, I'm outta here! [BULMA] Hey! [GOKU] Don't worry Bulma. I'll get him! Careful! Ah, Sassa-fras'n school of fish! Never did like school! This kid's crazy! I don't see him anywhere. Where'd he go? I lost him, Bulma! Well, if you want to catch a fish, you gotta use the right kind of bait. [BULMA] Like this! Do you think he'll bite? If I know Oolong, he will! [BULMA] I think I've got a nibble. Yeah! Grab him, Goku! Hey, whaddaya know, he bit your shorts! Hey, why is all the food gone? Did you make a pig of yourself? Unfortunate choice of words, but the great outdoors do make me hungry. [BULMA] Here, take this special vitamin. It'll fill you up, and give you strength! It doesn't look like much, but I'll try it. [BULMA] It's made from all natural ingredients. It's very good for you. I just hope you health nuts don't eat pork. [BULMA giggling] [GOKU] Hey, Bulma! What about me? I'm hungry too! Uh, that was the last one. See, kid? It's my hoggish allure. I'm not your average porker! [engine sputtering] [ALL] Huh?! That's great! We're outta gas! Is that sorta like being out of food? Very good, that's exactly what it's like Goku. Then let's just feed the boat. Hey, Oolong, can you change into a tank of gas? Against union rules, honey! Besides, I'd get all used up. [BULMA] Then how about a paddle just to help us get to shore? [OOLONG] I'd be honored to be "handled" by a girl like you, Bulma. Showtime! Just go like this in the water, and we'll move. Wow, that's really neat! [GOKU] Ha ha ha, yeah! [OOLONG sputtering] [OOLONG] Hey! Watch the water in the mouth, you muscle-bound midget! [GOKU laughing] I gotta go, Bulma! [BULMA] Don't be gone long! [BULMA] Goku! Really, that kid... Well, it's too bad we couldn't make it to Fire Mountain! I hate to disappoint you, Oolong, but we're practically there already. But it's crazy to go there! It's way too dangerous! My... my Dyno Caps! They're missing! No! Aah! We're trapped in a wasteland with no way to get out! I think you took our Dyno Caps, just like you stole our lunch, you little porker! Hey! I resent being called little! [BULMA screaming] What's the matter? Why are you so upset? You don't understand! Without the Dyno-Caps we're stuck here! No boats! No bikes! Nothing! Nada! But... Why can't you just walk, Bulma? That's easy for you to say! You can ride the Flying Nimbus! [OOLONG chuckling] So long, suckers! Well, why don't you just have Oolong change into a motorbike, and then ride him outta here? [BULMA] Oh! That's a great idea, Goku. I'm glad I thought of it! Hey! Oolong, dear? Huh? Ahh! He ditched us! [GOKU] Don't worry, Bulma. I'll go get him! [GOKU] Hey, Oolong where are you? Come out, come out wherever you are! You can't hide forever! Hey, oh, Oolong! If you come out I'll give you a nice juicy pail of slop! [OOLONG] If he thinks I'm dumb enough to fall for the old 'juicy pail of slop' routine, then he's even dumber than I thought! There's no sign of him anywhere, Bulma. Oh! I knew I couldn't trust him! Piggy Piggy Piggy Piggy! Piggy Piggy Piggy! [BULMA] Piggy Piggy! [intense rumbling] [OOLONG] What's wrong with my poor stomach?! Woah! Oh, oh, I'm gonna blow! [intense diarrhea] Hey! Hey, Oolong! What's the matter, little piggy? You know that vitamin I gave you? It's really a pill that makes you have to go "squatty potty" anytime someone makes the "Piggy" sound! [BULMA] You're not going anywhere! Oh, that's perfect! Huh, guess I've got you under my power now, little piggy! [BULMA] What's with you? You're a witch! You cast a spell on Oolong, admit it! Oh Goku, don't be so naive! If I were a witch I wouldn't need the Dragon Balls to grant my wishes. That pill was just a little bit of science to control cowards like-- [OOLONG] Cheap shot! Lucky for me I brought some toilet paper along. So, I trust my little pill will keep you in line? Yeah... Yeah, I'll be "in line" to get in the bathroom, that's for sure! I'll bet this kind of stuff wouldn't happen if you acted nicer! I can still take ya, kid! Oh? Piggy piggy piggy! Piggy! [grunting] [intense diarrhea] I'll get you for this! [GOKU laughing] Well, I need my motorcycle now, Oolong! You lazy... Huh? Hey, this isn't exactly what I had in mind, Oolong! Me either, toots. Oh well. Let's go. Can't you do anything right?! What do we do now, pork chop? Look, you amazon! Do you think it's fun being squashed to the ground by a horse like you?! So that's the thanks I get. What's the use anyway? I can only hold a new shape for five minutes, then--poof! Everyone thinks shape-changing makes you stronger that you really are, but it don't. I couldn't even carry you outta here, if I wanted to. But, I've got another idea. [screaming] Here, how's this, Bulma? [OOLONG] Put me on and then only one of us has to walk! You pervert! Take that! Next time, maybe you should try being her hat! [NARRATOR ] Continuing their journey on foot, Bulma, Oolong, and Goku press on into the uncharted, unexplored. and uncool. [panting] I gave up riding my cloud to walk with you two, now try and keep up! [BULMA] Just remember: you're not a city kid, Goku. You're used to the wilderness, but I'm not! I should be pampered! My gosh, look at this place! [OOLONG] Yeah, something's not right. I keep getting the feeling we're being watched. It's giving me the creeps! I can't stand it! I'm going crazy! Are you giving up? [BULMA] No! Yes... Maybe? I don't know! I want a bath! I need air-conditioning! I don't want to be stranded in the desert without a boyfriend or my Dyno-Caps anymore! Her passion for self-centeredness inspires even me. You sure are strange, Oolong. [BULMA] Ahh, shade. Nap-time... I say we just let her rest for a while. Suits me! I sure am hungry. Uhh. [CAT] Victims. [CAT] Yamcha! Yamcha! Victims! Woo hoo! Well. it's about time. [laughing] [YAMCHA] We've had quite a dry spell since we hijacked that caravan, haven't we, Puar? They're right down there, Yamcha. Can you see them? Can you see them? [YAMCHA] Only two? No problem. [OOLONG] I'm starving over here! I'm gonna go find us some food. Do you like bacon? What are you, brain dead?! [OOLONG] I think I hear something. [humming] [GOKU] What is it? It ain't no camel! [engine roaring] [giggling] Greetings. I am Yamcha. I am master of the land you trespass upon. It's my land, too! You needn't fear me. Just hand over your money and any Dyno-Caps you may have and I will let you pass in peace. You're Puar! We went to shape-shifting acadamy together. [PUAR] I remember! And you were a loud-mouthed bully! He always picked on me and stole my lunch money, because I was smaller than him! I'd say the tables have turned, my friend. How does it feel to face someone bigger than yourself, little piglet? This guy looks pretty tough, kid. Think you can take him? It's just like in the old days. The swine still hides behind someone whenever he's afraid! Not much courage, huh? That's right! Not an ounce of courage on that porker! Puar, if I ever get my hands on you... Sounds like you haven't changed much over the years, Oolong. Okay boys, enough talk. Either hand over your goods or prepare to fight me. Just how strong are you Goku? I'm super strong. All right, big shot! The bigger you are the harder you fall! You may think you're looking at an easy haul here, but my man will slap you two silly before it's all said and done! [YAMCHA] Prepare to defend yourself. [PUAR] Make pork chops out of him, Yamcha! He can't talk to you like that! [OOLONG] Just a second. All right! Destroy 'em little buddy! Oolong, why should I want to destroy this guy? Did he hurt somebody? [OOLONG] Haven't you been listening, kid? That sword isn't made outta rubber you know. He plans to kill us! [GOKU] I don't want to fight you, but if I have to defend my friends, I will! I admire your bravery, kid. Is it bravery or stupidity? [snoring] Geez, I thought it was an earthquake! [snoring] Hyaah! Hi-ya! Hyaah! [clank] Power Pole, extend! Unbelievable! Believe it! The kid's winning this one, isn't he?! You have great power for a little one, don't you? [GOKU] Thank you. My Grandpa trained me. [YAMCHA] Ahh. The pole. the extending Power Pole. Only one man could have given that to you. Who is this grandfather of yours? His name was Gohan. And he died a long time ago. I knew of him. But even with your magic pole and all that he may have taught you, I'm afraid you are still no match for me. [YAMCHA] I will have that pole's power. Give it to me or prepare to fight to the death! Uh-oh. We're lunch meat now! I'm starving! You're not the only one with special powers, kid. Watch this! Wolf Fang Fist! [wolf howling] --[wolf howling] --[YAMCHA yelling] [YAMCHA yelling] [blow landing] [blows landing] [crashing] [OOLONG] Guess we won't need a headstone. Why do I always back the loser? Why does it always have to happen this way?? Now he'll come for me! [OOLONG] Gee, I'd love to stay and fight with you, but I gotta fly! Now's your chance, Puar! Get him! Right. With pleasure! You mangy mongrel! What'dya go and do that for? I owed you one, Oolong! [YAMCHA] Now, my worthless adversary, either hand over what you have or join your friend. That's a choice, huh? There's absolutely nothing worse than getting ripped off. [YAMCHA] Make it snappy, pig. My patience with you is wearing thin. [rumbling] Gotta get some food... [YAMCHA] Thank you! [GOKU] Hold It! Right now, I've had just about enough of you! If you've truly had enough, kid. go back to sleep amongst the rubble and don't provoke me again. Come on. I'm just getting warmed up, you know. [blows landing] [crash] That's it, kid! [shouting] Oh boy, I think I'm gonna die if I don't get something to eat. Why're you just standing there Goku? Do something! [screaming] Gee whiz, you guys. What's all the screaming about? [YAMCHA] She's gorgeous! [tea kettle whistling] Master, you okay? Puar, you know I have trouble around beautiful women! I know. Well, I guess we put them on the run, didn't we? Hey, you guys, who was that hunk? He looked absolutely dreamy! Oh, wow! Can we eat now? [NARRATOR] Meanwhile, back in Yamcha's hideout. [YAMCHA] A warrior toppled by a girl is humiliating! Yamcha, she had nothing to do with it. You just tripped! That's a lie, Puar! I froze when I saw her. But I will overcome my fear of women. Those fools have not heard the last of Yamcha! [NARRATOR] It would seem that our heroes haven't seen the last of Yamcha, the desert bandit. Join us again for the next episode of Dragon Ball!
