 Having left Bulma and the others behind, Goku rides on Kinto Un towards the Turtle Hermit in order to further his training. This area is near my house, ain't it? This is the first time I've ever seen it from the sky. I'm going to be staying at Old Timer Turtle Hermit's place now. I'd better take a futon and stuff. I'm so hungry. I know, I'll have the Old-timer give me something to eat! "Goku's Rival? Appears" O-o-ou-ouch! O-ouch! That was close! If we'd been just a little slower bailing out... We would have all gone over to the Other Side.

 Ow! Help me! Just let go. Huh? Really? Ouch! Are you all right? Here... Our airplane's been destroyed! We were over on the weight. Now what should we do? We're screwed. There aren't any more Hoi Poi Capsules, for one... At any rate, let's get out of here. It's creepy! Right, let's do that! Let's get going, now! Wasn't that a human voice just now?

 That doesn't matter right now! Hey! Just a sec, Bulma! Hold up! Yamucha-sama! Yahoo! Whoa, that's cold! Yay! Ah, there it is, there it is! Hey, Old-Timer, I'm here! Huh? Maybe he ain't here. One, two, one, two... Huh? One, two, one, two... And stretch out nice and wide, a one, two, one, two... A-one, two... one-two... What's this, you are here! One, two, one, two, there we go, a little more... Old-timer! And a-one, two, one, two... Nice, nice, nice! Way to go! A-one, two, one, two... A-one, two, one, two... Old-timer! Oh, it's you, is it? Old-timer, I've come to train... Wait a second. Wait just a second. ...Here we go, one, two, one, two... ...One, two, one, two! Old-timer, I'm kind of hungry... Huh? There's a refrigerator in the kitchen over there. You can eat whatever. One, two, one, two! Hmm? Could that be it? He sure puts his food in a weird box. Whoa, it's so cold! It's like winter inside here! Go! One, two, one, two! There we are! One, two, one, two! Hmm, what's this? If it ain't ice! Well, see you again next week. Bu-hy-hye! That was great! And, ups-a-daisy... Oh! l- It's empty! Did you eat all of that? Yeah. Even the butter! That was a week's worth of food for me. What on earth are you here for? I'm done hunting for the Dragonballs for now, see? I've come for you to train me, like you promised. What, training? I see, I see. I brought my futon and everything! Say, is that pafu-pafu girl here? You mean Bulma? She went back to her house in the city. What a shame. Aren't we to the city yet? It's strange. We should just about be there by now. Which direction was the city supposed to be in? North... We just have to go directly north. Pu-Erh, compass! Right. Transform! South! We're walking south! T- That's the exact opposite way! I wonder when we got mixed up. I sure am thirsty. My stomach's empty... Ow... We can't let you get that infected. Let's replace the dressing. Thanks, Yamucha. What nonsense! What's that? Has to be a sandstorm. I'm going to get much, much stronger! My training is very strict. I don't mind. I'm going to become stronger than you, Old-timer Turtle Hermit. Oh, I see! You want to become stronger than me, do you? Well, I won't train you for nothing. Huh? Bring me a Pichi-pichi gal here. Do that, and I can train you! What's a bitchy bitchy gag? A Pichi-pichi gal! That's a cute, lively young woman! A Pichi-pichi gal, huh? I bring one of those here, and then you'll train me, right? Yeess! Oh, that'll be easy! Off I go! Ah, j- Just a second... Hum? I'm just asking to make sure, but you do know what "Pichi pichi young woman" means, right? It's a guy with no winkie and lots of spunk, right? Well, I suppose, so, but... They've got to have more than just lots of energy. They can't be too child-like, and not too old. They must be cute, and if possible, a "Mutchiri," voluptuous girl is "best." This is getting confusing. When you say, "Mitchiri" is "besto," what does that mean? We're going to have to start out from common knowledge with you. No matter! I'll bring one here in any case. I'm counting on it! Huh? Didn't you have a tail? Yeah. I had one, but it went off somewhere. Well, I'm off! What a strange boy... Turtle, turtle, lookie, lookie, Turtle Hermit... Pichi-pichi, gal, gal, la la la... So, which shell should I go with? Oh, boy, oh, goody, oh, boy, oh, goody... Oh, boy, oh goody... Hey! Old-timer, I brought one! Come right in! She's got lots of energy! You need something with me? I am astounded at how little an eye you have for gals. You think so? All right then, let's test you. Which one of these is the attractive gal? That's a hard one... Don't struggle over something so easy! This is the kind you have to bring here! This is the kind! I don't quite get it, but I just have to bring someone like that, right? All right! I'm off! I'm not too sure about him. It'll be unpleasant if he brings back another weird one... Oh, he's back! Hey, Old-timer! I brought one! Let's see, let's see... Huh? Where'd he go? Say, what is this? ALL RIGHT!! Goku! Goku! Oh! I see, Old-timer, you're over here! Nicely done! You did all right, you little devil! Then you'll give me my training? All right, very well. So then, we will begin the training immediately. All right! G- Go get that gal's p- Panties and bring them here. This will be your very first discipline. "Pan-chee? " What's a pan-chee? She'll know when you tell her. Right! Hey, hey! You know... Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Old-timer! That rat! He isn't bringing anything, is he? Old-timer, do you know what a "shirt" is? Why do you ask? She said she's wearing just a shirt. She ain't wearing any pan-chee. Yikes! I just imagined it and all of a sudden... Now what do I do, Old-timer? There's nothing you can do. I'll have to teach you by example... l- I'll just pretend like it's nothing, and s- Start talking to her, while I h- Have a nice l- Long look! Luckily, I'm wearing sunglasses. She won't be able to follow where I'm looking! H- Hi! Hi... Such good weather we're having, isn't it? Say... Something I can do for you? A mermaid-san, are you? Damn, I thought it sounded too good to be true. Wait a minute! A mermaid has Pai-pai too! Um, it pains me to ask, but... Would you allow me to pinch at your Pai-pai for a little bit? I get it! By pan-chee, you meant "punch," huh!? You could say... To defeat your opponent, you must first be able to withstand his blows. We take punches to toughen ourselves. Indeed! Goku, bring me another Pichi-pichi gal. This time, one that doesn't have the bottom half of a mermaid. Bring yet another one? I thought I told you my training was strict. Right! Got it! Luckily, that pesky turtle is out travelling, and I can't let a rare chance like this get away from me! Huh? Old-timer, what's that? It's coming this way. l- Is it the turtle? Huh? No, I don't think so. It's a boat. There's a strange guy riding it. What have we here? Goku, get him out of there. Here! Thanks... You are Muten Roshi-sama, are you not? I certainly am. I have come from a village far to the east. My name is Kuririn. Please, allow me to train under you, Muten Roshi-sama! How good of you to come all this way. Unfortunately, I do not accept pupils quite so easily. Give up! Hum?? Please accept this book by way of salutation. W- What's this... ? Let me think about it. Then you have found it to your liking? Yeah, I like it. So then, who are you? Are you his pupil? Yeah. I'm Son Goku. I wouldn't think you were involved in the Budo arts. I like budo (grapes). Was that an attempt at a joke? Your head is just like a Pachinko ball, huh? What did you say!? Those who presume to undertake Budo would do well to shave their heads and sturdy their minds! Look! Don't you see Muten Roshi-sama? No, I'm just normally bald. So then... Kuririn, wasn't it? Yes! You must bring me a Pichi-pich gal as a condition of your training. I suppose you know my preferences? Am I correct? Not too shabby! You've got it down! You are too kind with your praise. All right. Then go together with Goku on the Kinto Un and find one right away! Kinto Un? Hop on, Kuririn! I'm supposed to ride on a cloud? Feels great! I see... W- What? I went right through it! You can only ride on that cloud if you have a pure heart. And so, you... ...you've come to train here with an impure motive, haven't you!? l- It isn't so! I came here to become stronger through Budo, so I could get girls. And that there is where you are impure. I beg of you, Muten Roshi-sama! Please accept me as your pupil! Here... Ooh?! Wow! Oh. And this one, and this one! These are all for you! Kuririn, newly-arrived, seeks to become a pupil. What lies ahead for those two?
