 [NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma have their five Dragon Balls, and are crossing the desert in search of the sixth. [NARRATOR] But a treacherous plan is being hatched to spoil their mission. [liquid pouring] Let's get going, Puar. We can't let those three slip through our fingers. Huh? But what about the girl, Yamcha? Remember? [chuckling] Leave that to me. I've got a plan.

 So, why didn't you tell us before that you had this camper Dyno-Cap, Oolong? Hmm? Well you didn't exactly ask me, now did you? Besides, I didn't want those bandits to steal it. [chomping] [OOLONG] Kid, watch yourself, you're gonna choke. Mmm...This is good. I hope I see Yamcha again. He was so shy and so handsome... [BULMA] Does this place have a tub? [OOLONG] Yeah, right in there. [BULMA] Huh. To tell you the truth, I'm used to much nicer accommodations. [OOLONG] Then why don't you try a luxury hotel down the road?

 I'm sure there are lots of 'em out here in the desert! It's just that it's so small. Well it ain't no palace, but I don't see any royalty around either, get it? Now what are you looking for? [BULMA] Peepholes. Hey! What kind of place you think I'm runnin'?! Well, I wouldn't put it past you. What? [BULMA] You little perv. [chuckling] [OOLONG] I'll let you win the battle, sister, but I'm gonna win the war. [crickets chirping] [mechanical springing] [beeping] [MAI] Emperor. Spy pods are now in position. We are ready to put operation "Desert Dragon Bomb" into effect. Over. Good. Proceed as planned, Agent Mai. Base out. [MAI] Let's go! [MAI] Come on! [beeping] [SHU] It's set to go off in four minutes. [MAI] Huh? [running footsteps] Shu, somebody's out there! [SHU] Hm? Let's get out of here. [SHU] Mai, I think we have a problem. The bomb is stuck to my hand. [squealing] This isn't good, Shu! What should I do?! [running footsteps] You better wait here. I'll go get help. [SHU] Hey, wait for me! [YAMCHA] Mm-hmm...a double-decker camper. I'll bet we can get a decent price for a rig like that. But what about the girl? [chuckling] Easy. All we have to do is find a way to lure her out of there for a few minutes. Then we sneak in and rob them blind! Ha ha ha! [PUAR] You're starting to scare me. You think we're safe out here? Don't worry! The worst thing that could happen to us is they take our stuff. That's it, huh? Well I don't know if you've noticed, but I've got some very serious cargo here. You're not worried, 'cause you don't have anything worth stealing. Yeah-huh. My Dragon Ball. Huh? Dragon Ball? What's that? [GOKU] Well, Bulma asked me not to show you, but...I guess it's okay. Neat, huh? --[water running] --[BULMA humming] [BULMA humming] Okay, she's right above us. [PUAR] Master, can you see if the other two are with her? Hang on. [YAMCHA stuttering] [YAMCHA screaming] [YAMCHA whimpering] Yamcha?! What happened?! Are you all right?! [BULMA] Hmm?  Is something out there? Hm? Oh well. I hate turning into a bowl of mush everytime I see a girl! It's not your fault... [PUAR and YAMCHA] Hmm? I think I hear something. [OOLONG] Are you sure it's true? It's the pig and the kid. Hmph. [OOLONG] So, when you get all seven Dragon Balls together, the Dragon appears and grants a wish? [GOKU] Uh-huh. Yep, that's right. [OOLONG] Any wish you can think of? Guess so. That's what Bulma said. So, how many more Dragon Balls do you need? Just two. [OOLONG] Heh! We're on to something really big here, Goku old pal! --Come on. --Right! Well, it seems we hit the jackpot! Yeah? Puar, you know what this means, don't you?! What Yamcha? I will never be shy around women again! Never! But Yamcha, if you could have any wish, then you could rule the world and have all the riches in it. Come on! How long have you been with me? [PUAR] It's been two years, one month, and three days. After all this time, I thought you really would have known me by now. [PUAR] I thought so too... Well, my furry friend, you don't. I have no aspirations to rule the world. Understand? I think I do... [YAMCHA] No... I want what no riches in the world can buy... Don't you see that one day I'd like to get married? Or at least be able to ask a girl out on one single, lousy date! See what happens when you don't have an afternoon nap, Master? From now on, we have only those Dragon Balls in our sights! We'll get them. Mark my words. You know, kid? We need to cut Bulma out. That's all there is to it. But Bulma and I are partners. Why would you want to cut her out? Look, kid, she's a girl and we're guys. And we're going to want to wish for some guy things. Like, a harem with three-hundred girls! Golly, why would you wanna have three-hundred girls? Huh? How's that, kid? Well, can you imagine what it would be like having three-hundred Bulmas to listen to? How dare you talk behind my back, Goku?! I was just, uh... Oh, nevermind. Oolong, do you have any extra pajamas? Oh, like mine would fit you. [BULMA] So what am I supposed to wear to bed, then? What am I, your butler?! Well, with that hat you look like one. [BULMA] Or a limo driver, or something. [OOLONG] Here you go. This cold juice will calm your nerves. You can be a sweet swine, can't you? More than you'll ever know. Aw, thank you. [snickering] [sniffing] Eww, this stuff's gross! [OOLONG] It's for, uh, health nuts. It's, uh, supposed to make you strong. Oh well. Down the hatch. [snickering] I do feel stronger! You want some, Oolong? Oh, for me? I, uh, had mine already. So where do I sleep? I'm tired... Just go right up those stairs there. [BULMA] Good night. And you better not come up here! Or I'll just have to make the 'piggy' sound again, and you'll be going "Wee, wee wee! All the way home"! Get it? Gotcha. [BULMA] And since you're not doing anything, I want my clothes cleaned by morning. Right. [OOLONG grumbling] Boy, the way she was nagging me, you would think we were married or something. I'll never understand women. Huh? [snoring] [OOLONG] That sleeping powder works faster than I thought! [OOLONG] Stealing the Dragon Balls is gonna be a cinch with these kids knocked out! [SHU] Uh-oh! [MAI] Hurry, Shu! Something's wrong! It won't stop! It's gonna blow in less than a minute! [MAI screaming] Oh, what am I gonna do? I'm too young to blow up... What happened? Tell me, Shu! Nothing to worry about, Mai. I reset it for eight o'clock tomorrow morning. Then: boom. [GOKU snoring] [chuckling] [OOLONG] I bet the Dragon Balls are upstairs... and I know the first place I'm gonna look. It's all clear, Yamcha. All right, Puar. This is it. You know what to do? Uh-huh! [lock clicking] [chuckling] What's that?! This kid is really zonked out! I wonder where the other two have gone? I guess they're upstairs. Puar, I want you to change into this kid here and lure the others outside, okay? Okay! How could Goku be awake after that dose I gave him?! [OOLONG] I don't get it! I put enough in his drink to knock out a horse! [OOLONG] If that little imp catches me up here, he's sure to squeal to Bulma and she'll fry my bacon good! I gotta think of something fast! Oh, I know! Oh, hi, Goku! You scared me! [PUAR] Hey. Where's Oolong? Oolong? I thought he went for a walk? I thought he was back! [PUAR] Hey, I know! Let's go outside and look for him! There's something I wanna show you out there, anyway. Well, um, all right. [OOLONG muttering] [PUAR] Looks like Oolong hasn't come back yet! [giggling] [OOLONG] I have a feeling he's pretty close by! With her out of the way, nothing can stop me! Strange, though. In the daylight she seemed much prettier... [GOKU snoring] [YAMCHA] Ah-ha! I betcha I know what's under here: Dragon Balls! Odd. They seem... kinda flimsy... I'm freezing! What do you want to show me?! It's right up here. Now, watch real close! What in the world?! Tricked you good, huh? You wanna make a bet?! Oolong?! But--! [screaming] Master! Come back here! [whimpering] Are you okay?! Not... Dragon Balls... Not... Dragon Balls... My poor master! [OOLONG] Hey! Where are you?! [PUAR] Come on, Yamcha! Let's go! Come on, come on! [YAMCHA] Not... Dragon Balls... Not... Dragon Balls... It's like a thieves convention here! [birds cawing] [GOKU yawning] It's about time. Oh, good morning. Yeah, for you, maybe. Nice sleep? Huh? Oh... I have a terrible headache... Hey, Oolong, did you get my clothes clean yet? Sorry, I've been a little busy. What?! What do you mean 'busy'?! This is serious! I don't have any clothes to wear! I mean busy saving your hides from Yamcha. Yamcha? [BULMA] Wow, he came back! Were you nice to him? Yamcha's real shy, you know? I think I'm gonna puke. What did you say?! Nothing. And if you really need clothes, there's one outfit in the drawer upstairs. Why didn't you just say so in the first place?! Hmph! Yeah. come to think of it, maybe three-hundred girls is a few too many, little buddy. [GOKU] So, does that mean you're changing your mind about the harem thing? [OOLONG] Yup! Gee, you sure are one smart pig, Oolong. [stomach growling] I'm hungry. You are always hungry, kid. [beeping] [PILAF] What?! You two failed me again?! Next time I'll know better than to get my spies from the want ads! Sorry, sir. But we've already reprogrammed the bomb. It's set to blow at eight. What? At eight? [PILAF] Why, that's just an hour away. All right, but no more mistakes! [MAI] Yes, sir. Agent Mai out. [chomping] A month's supply of food gone! Hey, what's this? Easter?! This is no outfit, it's a costume! And I look ridiculous in it, Oolong! Well, tough luck! That's all I've got. My stock of women's clothes is down this month. Hmph. You know, there's something not quite right about you, Oolong, but I just can't quite figure it out. I'm a pig? Whew, me too! Ha ha, that was great! [engine humming] [OOLONG] So why am I driving? I just hate driving! [BULMA] Oh, quit your complaining. I'm putting on my make-up. Kid, this girl's a pain in the neck. Tell me if you see Yamcha. [tires squealing] Yeah, we'll keep our fingers crossed, Bulma. Oh, can't wait to see him. Is that him? [YAMCHA laughing] Wow! That Yamcha's such a hunk! [YAMCHA] Steady Puar. That's it! Oh! He's looking right at me! Uh-oh. [BULMA screaming] What's the big idea?! Are you two nuts?! [PUAR] Don't worry about the girl, master. I bet she got knocked out in the crash. Okay. Game's up. Listen. Now give me the Dragon Balls or you will die! Goku, how does that goon know about the Dragon Balls?! Stop your gawking and hand them over, now! I'll hand over this! Goku, he's got a gun! I couldn't possibly turn down a fight with Gohan's grandson, Puar. So, you little runt, you want another spanking from my Wolf's Fang Fist?! I was hungry last time, but now my stomach's full! [blows landing] Atta boy! Have you had enough yet? Yamcha, let's get out--Oh no! Look at your teeth! [YAMCHA screaming] [YAMCHA] Oh no, look at me! Now I'll never get a date! [YAMCHA] I won't forget this, kid! I'll be back! [engine revving] That was strange. Wow, Goku! You were phenomenal! You really showed him! Thanks, Oolong. I think we'd better go check on Bulma. [OOLONG] Hope she's in better shape than our ride... I guess we underestimated that kid. He knows his stuff. But we can use that to our advantage, Puar. We'll just let them find all of the Dragon Balls. Then, when they have all seven, we'll make our strike. Yamcha, you are the greatest! You are! [YAMCHA screaming] Looks like that bomb did the trick. Those poor shmucks never knew what hit 'em. That's strange. It blew before eight o'clock. Don't worry about it. Pilaf probably got those bombs on sale. [MAI] I'm going to check inside for the Dragon Balls. [beeping] I wonder how Bulma stayed out of trouble before she met me. Hey, why don't you let me carry her little buddy? I'd be happy to give her - er, you a hand. [chuckling] [YAMCHA] Hey, you guys! Over here! Ah! Look, kid! It's him! [YAMCHA] Wait, wait, wait, wait! Hello there! We were talking and, uh, oh well, we really don't want to have any hard feelings between us. Ha, it was a fair fight, so, here you go! What's the catch? There is no catch, my friends. Goodbye! Have a good day! Man. What's up with him? I guess deep down, he's really a good guy. Yeah, bologna. I don't buy it. I better check this thing for bombs. Sometimes you have to trust in people. [OOLONG] Yeah, right. [beeping] [PUAR] There they go, Yamcha. Your homing device is working! [explosion] Shu... are we still alive...? I think so... [NARRATOR] Even with the odds stacked against them, our heroes continue their trek across the desert in search of the elusive Dragon Balls. What perils await them? [NARRATOR] Will they survive? Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball.
