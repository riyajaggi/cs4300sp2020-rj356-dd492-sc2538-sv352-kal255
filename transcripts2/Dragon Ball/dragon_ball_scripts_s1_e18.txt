 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, the morning came ridiculously early for Goku and Krillin who hope to enter the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament... Even before the rooster's first call, the boys had begun their intensive physical training under Master Roshi's expert gaze. [NARRATOR] Their first task-- Deliver the 4:30 AM shipment of milk around the island! Normally this is done by helicopter, but as the boys soon learned, convenience is not the M.O. of Turtle Hermit Training!

 They zigzagged through orchards to test agility... They struggled up mountain steps to test endurance-- which Krillin didn't have much of-- and they teetered over dangerous canyons to test their balance. [NARRATOR] The training was hard and will only get harder, but as any warrior knows, it's important to keep moving. [NARRATOR] Especially when there's a T-Rex on your heels! [DOJO MASTER] You live--fighting...! You breathe--fighting...! You eat--fighting! [DOJO MASTER] Drink... Fight...! Sleep...! Fight! [NARRATOR] Across the land, fighters train themselves for the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament. [AX MAN roars]

 [growls] Raaargh! [NARRATOR] In but a few short months, the world's fiercest warriors will gather together-- all sharing a single desire... That tournament belt will be mine!!! [chuckles] Two hundred... and twelve...! Thirteen!! Fourteen...! Two hundred fifteen...! Sixteen! Lie down now and you'll be kicked out of the tournament in the preliminary round! Now get yourself up!! [panting] I just barely made it... I'm glad we're done... What's that you say? He's glad we're done... With today's training, I mean... Oh please...! That run was only early morning exercise!! Uh? Eh? [groaning] Now it's time for mid-morning exercises! [gasps] You're gonna try your hands at agriculture! [ROSHI] For that man over there! Agri--what? [ROSHI] Excuse me, sir! [KRILLIN] Agriculture... It's a big word that means "playing with dirt"... [GOKU] Oh... [FARMER] Of course Master Roshi! Sure, that's fine. Thanks. They'll be so happy... Come on boys...! Time to get dirty!! First we're the milk men and now we're stinkin' farmers... We never did this at Orin Temple! Think I'll just supervise... Hold on there...! Don't use the tool! [GOKU and KRILLIN] Huh? This exercise is for the strength and dexterity of your hands, so of course it won't work unless it's done bare-handed! Like with our fingers?!! You betcha. [ROSHI] Beautiful day, isn't it? [FARMER] Yes, it is! Oh...! My fingernails are gone! So, ready to quit, Krillin? Huh? No. I gotta say... Those boys work like tractors! [GOKU] Master Roshi... [KRILLIN] Stop with the tingling! We finished it... That's excellent work boys...! But you must learn to move faster... The amount of land you till will increase every day. Now, who wants breakfast? Ooh... Hunger... Give me a chicken and I'll eat it raw... [LAUNCH] Perfect! Well it's about time...! Hurry up so it doesn't get cold, you guys! [ROSHI] Wait for Roshi!!! [LAUNCH] Let's say our grace first then we'll eat all this food, okay? [LAUNCH and KRILLIN and ROSHI] Thanks very much! Wait...! Not the pepper...! She's a land mine! [KRILLIN] What?! Who is?? I-- Uh-oh... [sneezes] [sinister laughter] Alright... Dessert... is... on... me! You cowards! Let's go out to eat! More rice please! Me too! Each day we'll be hitting the books from now until lunchtime... A strong body is pointless unless you know how to use it... And that takes brain-power! Oh... But I don't have that! So the wonder-boy has a weakness... First off... literature...! Goku, please read from page fourteen. [GOKU groans] "Ooh... Susie that tickles... What if they find us here?" ...said Bill. But Susie did not stop, holding his foot lightly in her hand... [KRILLIN] And that means, X would equal... Well, wait... How do you spell X...? Maybe it's time we had lunch... [GOKU cheers] How silly...! I forgot the soup! Lunch isn't right without it! Yes... We'll spend this hour on good old napping! Work hard, study well, and eat and sleep plenty...! That's the Turtle Hermit way to learn! Hey... Master... What's up? Are there gonna be a lot of really strong fighters at this tournament we're in? Oh, you bet...! This tournament is like a big magnet for all the greatest fighters across the globe! I can't wait... Some people spend their whole lives training just to make it through the qualifying round! So... what if while we're lying in our hammocks, someone else out there is training and getting stronger than us? How do we know? [ROSHI] The truth, Goku, is that we can't know... But I think you'll find that everyone, even the strongest warriors, need their shuteye... And this will be your mid-afternoon training... Construction work helps with balance and muscle-size, and could earn you boys some extra dollars on the side! [FOREMAN] You sure these kiddos can work? They look a little small for a pickax! Oh, just wait...! Once you see these two work you'll want to pay them five times the typical salary! [FOREMAN] Five times...?! You must think I'm a fool!! Well let's wait until you see them before we decide that... Start diggin' boys! Do... we... still have to use bare hands? Hmm... Not this time, Krillin. Just no power-tools, okay? Work force keeps gettin' younger... What... are they?? Turn up the motor boys or you'll never make it to the tournament! [KRILLIN thinking] Stay with it, old buddy...! Stay with it until you can beat them! Okay, you win... You are such a miserable runt...! I can't believe the Master wastes his time on you! Come on, little Krillin! Don't you want to fight? Oh look...! He almost dodged it! Don't worry...! There's always the circus! So that's why the Master kept him...! He makes such an excellent punching bag! [laughter] All right! All right! I'll pay whatever wage you want for them!!! After the sweat you boys worked up at that last site I'm having you jump in the lake! You mean there's more! Of course! Isn't the sun still up? Master...! When are you gonna start teaching us fighting moves? Now don't get jumpy...! There are certain basics you need before learning Martial Arts and you boys aren't there yet! I will be delighted to teach you the secrets of Martial Arts just as soon as you're strong enough to move this rock! What...? Move that thing...? Well I don't mean any disrespect Master, but that's impossible!! Oh really? Impossible, is it...? Well if you two stop complaining and stick with my program... One day you'll be able to do this too! [KRILLIN] Yes, master! [GOKU grunting] Now why do I get the feeling that you missed the entire point of my lecture, Goku? Hey look...! You can teach us now! Krillin wants everybody to know that he's speechless right now... [chuckles] Oh yeah...? Well that's my mistake...! Guess I was in such a hurry that I pushed the wrong rock...! I mean anyone and his great-grandmother could push a rock of that size! [ROSHI] There! That's the rock I meant...! Once you move that then you're ready for Martial Arts...! Yup! Whoa...! That one's giant!! Master Roshi, it just won't move! Naturally, son...! That all comes with dedicated training! [GOKU] Can you move it then? [ROSHI] Of course! Really...?! Come on Master let us see! [ROSHI] What do you say we go do some training...? The clock is ticking you know...! [ROSHI] Now I want you to swim ten laps, okay...? And try not to splash each other in the eyes! Well that's quite a relief... Some easy stuff at last! Ready! Set! Swim! I guess Master Roshi is rewarding us for good behavior. Yeah it's kinda like taking a bath! You better watch out boys, there're some big fish in there! [KRILLIN] What kind of big fish? [ROSHI] Sharks, mostly...! [GOKU] Did you feel that? [KRILLIN] Feel what? That's not a lap Krillin...! You forgot to touch the other side of the shore! Are you kidding me? At least we're safe... Hey...! You haven't finished swimming! Now that's what I call motivation! [ROSHI] Good job, boys! Are you ready for the next lesson? This exercise will test your reflexes and dodging speed! Why'd you tie us up with rope Master Roshi? Sometimes when fighting we get cornered and must dodge the enemy in a limited space...! You see? [ROSHI] Good luck men! Hold on... What are we dodging from? Concentrate hard and you won't get stung! Don't just run! Dodge! Dodge! [ROSHI] Concentrate boys! Obviously we'll have to work on your dodging ability... But on the bright side, you've completed your first full day of training! Master... Please say our training isn't going to be this difficult every single day... Of course not Krillin. It will be much more difficult! For the next few months you'll be doing the exact same training schedule as today... But you'll be wearing these stylish fifty-pound turtle shells! [NARRATOR] Guess that's why they call him the Turtle Hermit...! [NARRATOR] Goku and Krillin have their hands full, but it should all pay off ...! Because the World Martial Arts Tournament is coming soon!
