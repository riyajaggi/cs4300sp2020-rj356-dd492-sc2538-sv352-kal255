 Ladies and gentlemen, I give you... Goku and Giran!! Oh yeah, that's our boy! Do it, Goku!! Giran...? I wonder who that is... Come on, Goku! You can beat him! [GIRAN chuckles] [roars] Oh, good... He's just a monster. And to think I was worried... Hi everyone...! My name's Goku! Yeah! Hey! We know your name, you big ham! [GIRAN snickers] Now, fighters ready? Beeeegin! Hm? [thunder rumbles] [BULMA and CROWD cheer] [panicked cries] [ANNOUNCER] So what do you think? [DIRECTOR] Woof... [ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen, the Director has not postponed the fight as of yet! The match is still in progress! [ANNOUNCER] Wait a minute! I have a new ruling from the Director. The match has been postponed and will resume when there's a break in the weather! [ANNOUNCER] Apparently the fighters didn't hear the announcement over the storm! Ahem! Goku! Giran! Your match has been postponed until a later time! [raining] [YAMCHA] Well, I'm glad it started raining! I've got a bad feeling about that Giran guy, Goku! I don't think he deals from a straight deck! I'd keep my eye on him! [GOKU] Hm? You mean he cheats! [YAMCHA] Mm, hm! That's what I heard some guys saying during the elimination round! Just don't let your guard down! I would expect the unexpected if I were you! You're real strong! But it's not always the strongest one who wins! Save your breath, buck-o. My kid's taking that ugly monster down! Aren't you, kid?! I'm definitely gonna try! Hey, you know what, I just realized?! Master Roshi's not here! Where the heck did he run off to?! For a second I thought that was him there! [YAMCHA] Hm? There is a resemblance, isn't there?! [OOLONG] Yeah!, they're both old geezers! [YAMCHA thinking] No, it's more than that! It's him alright! Jackie Chun and Master Roshi are one and the same-- I know it! [stomping feet] Yikes! It's him! [GIRAN quietly snickers] [scared murmuring from diners] [GIRAN] Hey, got milk? Huh? Milk, fool! Uh?! Milk?! Yes, of course! We've got milk! Coming right up! Here you go, milk. Big monster want milk! [FIGHTER 2] What a whimp... Hey, you guys! You started without me! [FIGHTER 1] Hm?! Hey you rhinoceros or whatever you are! Watch that stupid tail of yours! [GIRAN] Hmm? Don't act like you didn't hear me! You creep! Cool your jets! This is one of the guys trying to fight in the semi-finals! It's hard to believe just by looking at him! That's for sure! Yeah, No kidding! He must have gotten all the easy guys in the draw! Krillin! Aren't those some of the guys you used to train with? Uh, huh! It's a shame that the tournament has come down to two kids, a guy old enough to be their grandfather, a peasant, and a monster who likes milk! Yeah! This championship's a sham! I could beat them...! Easy... [FIGHTER 3] Alright, you big goon! You're asking for it! [FIGHTER 4] Watch that tail, guys! It's lightning fast! [FIGHTER 1] There's only one tail, and there's four of us! I like these odds! [GIRAN] That's pretty good. You know I kinda like you. I think I'm gonna kill you last... What? [GIRAN] You! Bartender... Huh? [GIRAN] Fill me up! Pour the milk! Now! Aaaah! Yes, sir! One glass of cold, Vitamin D milk coming right up! Did you see that?! Yeah! He's strong! I know! I get to fight him! [GIRAN snickers quietly] Knock it off! [GIRAN] Hmm? I think they got the message! Now back off! Enough is enough! Who the heck are you?! Whoa! Yamcha! [GIRAN] Uh, oh! It's happening! The rash. Huh?! Oooh! Man, that itches! This darn rash never fails! Fake heros! Pretenders! They make me break out! Ouch! Ooh! Stop it! Please! You're killing me! Very funny! [GIRAN] Wait! Don't go! [YAMCHA] Hm? [YAMCHA] Hey! What's the deal, pal?! My rash is very rare! The only cure is to stomp out the pretender causing it! [GIRAN] Come here, mister handsome hero! Take care of the big bad monster! Hey! What's going on?! We're supposed to fight in the match! Shut up! We're busy here, kid! Man! This guy's built like a mountain! Haaa! He means, pebble! I'm gonna squish you like a pancake! Ahhhh! Ahh!! Hey! How did you do that?! Not bad! This is going to be fun! Fun, huh?! We'll see! Haaaaaaa! [JACKIE CHUN] Stop it!! Don't you realize this is against the rules?! Fighting outside the arena is a serious infraction that will get you both kicked out of the tournament! I don't care about the stinking rules, gramps! [JACKIE CHUN] I guess you don't care about the prize money either! Huh?! [JACKI CHUN] If you beat the kid now you get nothing! If you beat him in the arena, you're well on your way to becoming rich! It's your choice, friend! Uhhh, yeah! Money is good! I'm going to beat you in the arena instead of here! You got lucky! Fat chance! I won't lose! [GIRAN chuckles] Dream on, kid! [GOKU] Are you okay, Yamcha? I'm fine... I guess I didn't know what I was getting myself into... [WOMAN] I can't believe they let monsters like that in the tournament! Be careful of him, Goku! Right! [FIGHTER 1] Uhhh! Remind me never to attack any ten-foot monsters again! [FIGHTER 2] Yeah, me too! [ANNOUNCER] Alright, alright, alright, alright! Yeah! And now, introducing for the second time the last two quarter-finalists: Goku and Giran!!! [roars] [ANNOUNCER] Wait a second! Where's Goku?! Maybe he high-tailed it out of here! No! Goku would never run! [ANNOUNCER] Goku... Hey Goku...! If you're back there, we uh, we need you to come on out now... He chickened out! Come on! Call the match, I won! Goku! Hey! Where are you?! Come on! You're gonna have to forfeit if you don't hurry! What's going on?! I just saw him a few minutes ago! I don't think he's here... Darn! What's that kooky little nut doing this time?! [ANNOUNCER ] Attention! Goku! Report to the arena in two minutes or your match will be forfeited! Hahaha! Come on! Give me the match! He ran away! Well, I guess I can't really blame him... Huh? I already told you! Goku wouldn't run away! He's not scared of anything! [RANFAN] Hey, guys! I found him! He's over here! Huh?! Yamcha! Come on! [YAMCHA] Goku! [KRILLIN] Hey, Goku! [snores] What are you doing, Goku?! Wake up, you idiot! Oh... hi, guys! Are you crazy? Oops, I'm sorry! I was sitting in the sunshine with that cool breeze and I just conked out! Goku! What are you doing?! Come on! Well! He's back! Certain circumstances prevented him from hearing the announcement! I was taking a nap! [GIRAN thinking] He's mocking me... Let the last quarter-final match begin! [CROWD ecstatically cheering] I'm going to pound you into the dirt, you no good little brat! Alright! Yeah, Goku! Look at that itty-bitty guy warm up!. He's not even scared! Hey! Look what I have! Huh?! It's a secret! Wow! A secret! Really? What is it?! Come on! Aren't you going to show me?! Uh, huh! Here! Check it out! [ANNOUNCER] What an awesome attack! I hope Goku's alright! It's hard to compete against a powerful blow like that! Let's give him credit for making it this far! What a fighter! Don't worry, folks! The tournament doctor is on the way! Here comes the doctor now. Please let him through! I hope Goku isn't hurt! Me too! This is terrible! What?! [ANNOUNCER] I-it's unbelievable! Goku is back on his feet and back in the match! And he's acting as if he didn't even feel that blow! I don't know what you were going to show me, but I don't even want to see it now! I knew he was okay! How could a concrete wall get the best of that thick head?! Whoop! [ANNOUNCER] Incredible! Young Goku has thrown Giran out of the ring and practically into the next town! It looks like he's won! What an incredible feat of strength! [CROWD gasps] Too bad, kid... Guess I forgot to mention I could fly... Aw, man... [ANNOUNCER] This is too fantastic to believe! After being thrown a hundred yards out of the arena, Giran is flying back in! And since no part of his body actually touched the ground, the match is still on! Well! If I can't throw you out, I'll have to take you down! [EVERYONE] Ahh!! What's this?! I... can't move! How do you like Giran's Merry-go-round Gum?! Oh, no! Rrrgh! ]That's right... Go ahead and struggle, kid. The harder you try, the tighter it gets...! Face it--you are stuck, right where I want you. Hey! What are you doing?! What do you think...? I'm throwing you out of the ring, just like you did to me. Hey! That's no fair...! You weren't all tied up when I threw you! [ANNOUNCER] Uh, oh! It doesn't look good for Goku! Giran has ejected some sort of rubbery substance form his mouth that has Goku hog-tied! There's no way he can avoid hitting the ground if he's thrown out! Sayonara, kid! Goku!! Darn! It's all over! Aaaaaahh! Wait! The Flying Nimbus! Flying Nimbus!! Come to me!! That was close... Thanks, Flying Nimbus...! I wasn't sure if you were going to be able to get to me in time! What?! You've gotta be kidding... [YAMCHA and KRILLIN] Alright, Goku! Yeah! Goodness! Your little friend is very resourceful! [GOKU] Did you miss me?! [ANNOUNCER] The fighters can't seem to stay out of the ring today, folks!! Hey! Look! That's cheating isn't it? Using any kind of outside tool is against the rules, right?! Look who's talking! What do you call this stuff you tied me up with?! Isn't that a tool...?! That's not classified as an outside tool! The Merry-go-round Gum is from inside my body, so it's fair! [ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen, the match has come under protest! Giran has objected to Goku's use of the mysterious cloud but the judge has ruled in Goku's favor! Huh?! The judge has declared that the cloud was part of the natural setting of the arena since his feet never touched the ground! However, Goku is forbidden to use the cloud again! Heh! Sounds good! I can live with that! Uh, oh!! Yeah, the next time he throws Goku out of the ring, he's done for! [JACKIE CHUN] Mmm! I'm gonna knock the living hoo-haa out of you, you little nuisance of a kid! Time's up! Just close your eyes, this is only going to hurt for a second! Bomb's away! What?! He's gone! But how?! This just isn't possible! Where'd he go?! [CROWD] He's right there, you doe-doe bird! [CROWD] No, not there! Hanging from your arm! There! [GIRAN] Huh?! Mm?! [ANNOUNCER] Unreal! Goku seems to be hanging by a... by a tail? Yay! My tail grew back, alright! Oh, no! It's back! After all this time, it finally grew back! Anyone for a moonlight stroll tonight?! No. thanks, I think I'll pass! Saved by the tail! But, I still can't beat him with this stuff on me! Fool! That gum can't be broken! Aaaaaah! Huh?! He did it!! [laughs] Alright! I'm free! Yay! Wow! I always feel so much stronger when I have my tail! Hmm! I better give it a quick test run... [GOKU] Yeah! With a little work it'll be even better than the old one! Mmm! Now! Let's finish this thing! Wait! I give up!! [ANNOUNCER] Amazing! Giran's throwing in the towel! He's quitting the match! Which makes Goku the winner! Goku is going to the semi-finals! Spectacular! Whoa! How does he do it? Man! He's too much! [NARRATOR] With a lot of courage and determination-- and a little help from a very special cloud, Goku has won his match and advanced to the semi-finals! Join us next time, for Dragon Ball!
