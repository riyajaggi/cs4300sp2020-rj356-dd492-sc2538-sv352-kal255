 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, Emperor Pilaf succeeded in uniting the seven magic Dragon Balls, and now prepares to summon the Eternal Dragon to grant his wish to rule the world. Come forth, Dragon! I call upon you to grant my wish! [NARRATOR] Little does the Emperor know, two of our heroes have taken flight in an attempt to thwart his diabolical plans. [PUAR] Come on, Oolong! We have to hurry! [OOLONG] How fast do you think a pig can fly? [NARRATOR] Meanwhile, the rest of the team watches helplessly

 from above, trapped within the confines of their prison cell. C'mon, Puar! You're our only hope now! You can do it, Oolong! [GOKU] What's going on, you guys?! I can't see! Eternal Dragon! Arise! [NARRATOR] At last, the Eternal Dragon has risen from its slumber within the fiery core of the Earth. And It seems nothing can prevent Emperor Pilaf from fulfilling his desire for world domination! [NARRATOR] Hurry, Oolong! Hurry, Puar! The fate of the world is in your hands! We're too late, Oolong. The dragon's already here!

 Now what are we going to do?! We can't just stand here and watch! Oh, we have no choice! Hey, let me see! I can't believe it... It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen! [PILAF] At last, my greatest dreams are finally coming true! Soon the whole world will be at my beck and call! [laughing] [cheering] [laughing] [laughing] [laughing] [whimpering] [GOKU] Wow, he's huge! [DRAGON] Who has summoned me? Uh, that would be me. I did. Tell me your wish. [DRAGON] But beware, for it will come true. We've got to do something! We can't just let the whole world go to ruin! [DRAGON] Speak! Do something, you stupid pig! I hope he ate already! Alright, then. I'm ready. Whoa, this is it guys! He's about to make his wish! [YAMCHA] Now I'll never get a date! [BULMA] My boyfriend! [PILAF] Uh, I wish for, uh... Ka-me-ha-me-ha! [GOKU] Darn, that didn't work! Kamehamehas make me hungry... But, I'm not gonna give up yet! Ka-me-ha--! [DRAGON] You try my patience! I'm sorry! It just that I've never done this before... [DRAGON] Make a wish! [DRAGON] Now! [PILAF] Yes, of course! [PILAF] My wish... how silly of me... my wish! I'm a coward! I don't want to be a hero! I don't want to save the day! This stinks! And these boxers are chafing! Uh... I would like to have supreme... ...me-ha! I want to have the world-- [OOLONG] The world's most comfortable pair of ultra-soft-- underwear! Huh? [snickering] I think that little pervert just saved the world! Maybe he's not such a coward after all! You dolt! [DRAGON] Your wish has been granted. [whimpering] All of the Dragon Balls just flew away! That's what happens when the dragon grants a wish. The balls are spread all over the earth again. What? That means the Dragon Ball Grandpa gave me to remember him by is gone! [snickering] [PILAF] Seize him! I want that pig for dinner! [PILAF] The others have escaped too! I want them all! Exterminate! Exterminate! [OOLONG] Hey, let's go, Puar! We can take those two! [guns firing] Or not! Goku?! [BULMA] What are you doing? I'm too hungry to go anywhere. [BULMA] You're too hungry?! You're gonna be too dead to go anywhere if you don't move it! C'mon! Shu, they're heading toward the north face! I'll call my dog police! We've gotta find Yamcha and the others. You wanna find those whiney goofballs, go right ahead. I've already saved the world once today. I feel like I've done my civic duty. You mean you're just going to leave your two friends behind?! Let's get outta here! Try thinking positive for a change! And run faster, you're falling behind! Think positive, huh?! Fine, it doesn't work. Snap out of it, Goku! I'm too hungry... Here they come! [YAMCHA] Dinner time, Goku! Yum-yum! Looks like I'm on clean-up duty. Wolf Fang Fist! C'mon! Let's get out of this stinkin' dog kennel! Power Pole, extend! They're... they're... they're gaining on us! Don't worry, I'm an expert at running away! Power Pole, extend! All right, so maybe it wasn't graceful, but at least I got us away from the dogs. You know, we could just change into birds and fly out of here. This is just great, Goku! So how do you think we're going to get over to that window, huh? I dunno. Now he tells us! You ready, Puar? Okay, let's go! [screaming] Ow, now that smarts! Oh, great, more dogs! I need some food, bad. [MAI and SHU] Attack! [SHU] Alright, drop that mutt! [BULMA] Yamcha? [growling] [maniacal laughter] I bet even Goku can't blast a hole this time! It's made of some weird metal. No big deal. Look! There's no ceiling! Yes there is. It's probably made of glass. It can't be harder than my head. Just watch this! And from the looks of it--tempered glass. Well, I'm not giving up. First, we're gonna get out of here, then we're gonna find all seven Dragon Balls again. There won't be any Dragon Balls for a year. What do you mean?! Yeah, what gives? It's all part of the legend. Once the Eternal Dragon grants a wish and the Dragon Balls are scattered across the earth again, they become inert for a full year. In other words, you won't even be able to tell they're Dragon Balls. They'll just look like round stones... Are... are you... serious? Yikes, that's harsh. I can't believe it... Now I have to be shy around women for another year! [BULMA] And I have to wait another year for a boyfriend... [PILAF] Is this on? I wouldn't worry your pretty, little heads over what's going to happen a year from now! You're all going to be terminated tomorrow! I hope you're enjoying your accommodations because I personally designed the cell you're in! I call it my Easy Bake Office! [PILAF] I wanted to see how hot I could make a room by absorbing all of the sun's rays! It's pleasant in there now, but just wait until the sun comes up! Then, get ready to broil! I'm going to roast you alive and enjoy every minute of it! That fiend! We've got to get out of here! Oh, now my skin's gonna dry up, and I'm gonna get premature wrinkles! At least you'll die with a tan! Oh, yeah, that's right. I'll be dead! I don't wanna die, I'm too young! I am, too! [wailing] I can't die now! Oh no, oh no, oh no! I'm hungry. [PILAF] They kind of remind me of those little goldfish I used to have. And they'll die just as quickly. [blows landing] [GOKU] Ka-me-ha-me-ha! [GOKU] Ha! --Come on you guys! --You can do it! That's right, struggle! Do you two idiots really think you can break through three solid feet of my super-special steel?! He's right, it's not gonna work. We're stuck here. Sleep well, and I'll wake you up early for toast! [laughing] [SHU] Carefully, sire. [PILAF] Ahh, there. That's it, see? Sometimes it's the small accomplishments in life that --have to suffice. --[SHU] So true. Of course, if it wasn't for those kids, I'd be ruling the world right now! But come sunrise, they'll all be french-fried! Uh? You think he'd at least give us a last request... Well, I have a last request! Oolong, will you please shut up?! Request denied, glamour girl! [PUAR] Ohh... [OOLONG] Hey, Puar, what are you doing up there? Nothing, just watching the moon. How can you watch the moon? Aren't you worried about tomorrow?! Yeah, but that's why I'm looking at the moon: It's soothing. Look how full it is tonight. Doesn't it make you feel all warm and fuzzy? I'm a pig, I am warm and fuzzy! A full moon? Did you guys know that a terrible monster comes out when the moon is full? Oh, come on Goku, you're making that up! There's no such thing. You should put that imagination to better use and figure out a way to get us out of here! But I'm not making it up, Bulma! My Grandpa was trampled to death by that monster! What? Gohan, the supreme martial arts master? That's gotta be one big, savage monster. Yeah. It destroyed our house and crushed all of our trees. [OOLONG] What did it look like, Goku? I'm not really sure, I slept through the whole thing. [OOLONG] What? How could you sleep if a huge monster was fighting your grandpa and wrecking your house? [GOKU] I don't know. The last thing I remember was Grandpa warning me about the full moon and how I should never, ever look at it. Of course, that didn't have anything to do with the monster. Grandpa was always saying these really strange things, and every-- [GOKU] Hey, what are you guys doing? Oh, nothing. Hey, Goku? Can I ask you a little something? Sure. [BULMA] The night your grandfather was killed, did you happen to look at the full moon? [GOKU] Well. I think I did. Just before I fell asleep. Why? I'm getting a little nervous... You're not the only one... I had a feeling that Goku wasn't just an ordinary kid, I think I was right. I'm at a loss here, Yamcha. How do we find out for sure? How do you find out what for sure? I guess we could make him look at the moon, then there wouldn't be any doubts at all! That's true... But what if he... What if he does turn into a monster? We'd end up just like his grandpa! Yeah, that'd be a lot of fun. Let's not chance it. It's far too dangerous. I'm with you! Goku, be very careful not to look at the moon! [BULMA] It's right above you! [GOKU] Huh? Huh. [GOKU] I don't see what the big deal is? Are you okay, Goku? Of course I am! You had us scared there, kid! Phew! I knew it was just a coincidence. I'd suggest we run, but I wouldn't know where! Goku, stop it, this isn't funny! [YAMCHA] I don't think he's joking! [growling] [screaming] [roaring] [screaming] [rumbling] [roaring] [SHU] Oh, I hate it when Pilaf starts snoring like this. [MAI] It feels like an earthquake. [SHU] That's ridiculous! [APE GOKU roaring] [NARRATOR] Will Goku return to his normal self? Or will he unknowingly be responsible for the destruction of Bulma, Yamcha, and the others? Find out next time, on Dragon Ball! [roaring]
