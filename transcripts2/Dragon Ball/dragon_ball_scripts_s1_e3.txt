 [NARRATOR] The adventure continues as Goku and Bulma have decided to put the hunt for the remaining Dragon Balls on hold, so that they can help a lost turtle find its way back to the sea. I hope we get there soon, I'm really getting hungry! You know, this is probably the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. Aw, hey. It's no big deal really! Well, I just wanted to thank you. Gosh. I think I'm going to cry.

 Spare me, please. Just concentrate on where you're going so we can get there while we're still young. Why are you always complaining? Why don't you try thinking happy thoughts, Bulma?! [BULMA] Hold on. Let's see if there's anything to be happy about. Hey. Not too bad. Just two more miles. Hm! Wow! We're close. That's great. Huh? I can't wait to get back in the water. [BEAR] Hm. [chuckles]

 Looks like dinner's on the way. [BEAR] Hold it right there! [BULMA screams] [laughs] Oh, yeah. Humans give me heartburn but I love turtles. So look. [BEAR] Hand it over or you're dead. Goku! You heard him! Give him the turtle, quick. Pppft! [BULMA] Eh?! Huh?! Ha! I guess a little heartburn never hurt anybody. All right. Have it your way. Die if you want. You idiot! You're going to get us killed! Give it to him. I don't care what this guy says. No. Are you out of your freakin' mind, kid? [GOKU] He's my friend, Bulma. [chuckles] Not for long. [yells] [screams] [GOKU] I think you better hop down. --[TURTLE wails] --[GOKU] Huh? [grunts] [GOKU] It's just you and me now! Ha-ha! You think you're real cute. [BEAR] Don't you, monkey boy?! You should have saved your skin, [BEAR] while you had the chance. [yells] --[BEAR grunts] --[GOKU laughs] [GOKU] You missed me. [GOKU] Over here, bear breath! [BEAR] Huh?! Forget about him, Turtle. Let's get out of here. [laughs] I like you, kid. Too bad you have to die. [growls] [GOKU] Yoo hoo! [laughs] [BEAR] Huh?! [GOKU] One. Two. Three. [BEAR] Huh? [groans] [GOKU] Yay! [GOKU] Well. That's that! [BULMA] Yeah... sure. Whatever you say, kid. [GOKU] Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine, thanks to you. So some creatures think you're good to eat, huh? What?! Oh, my! No, no! How disgusting. Turtle meat is tough and poisonous. You'd puke. [laughs nervously] [GOKU] That's what I thought! Some people will eat anything. Not me, though. [sighs] [BULMA] Ready, guys?! Let's go. [GOKU] Onward to the sea. [BULMA] Hey, wait up. [cooing] [BULMA] There it is, Goku. I found it. Huh?! No way. Wow. [GOKU] Look! Look! We're really here! It's huge. And blue! And beautiful! [laughing] Whoa. The sea! [BULMA] Isn't it beautiful, Goku?! [GOKU] Yeah! It's incredible. I never dreamed that a place like this really existed! [TURTLE] I was starting to wonder myself. It's been so long. Thanks for bringing me back. [GOKU] Hey! Sure! No problem. It was a lot of fun. [TURTLE] Well, I'd better get going. You sure do have a great home, Turtle! Well, I never would have made if it wasn't for you! Thank you. [GOKU] Hey, anytime. [TURTLE] Would you mind waiting here? I have a gift I'd like to bring you to repay you for all you've done for me. A gift?! What kind of gift could a Turtle have, huh? You'll see. I'll be back soon! Mm, hm. It's not a stupid shell, is it?! Hey, hold on. Ah... He's gone. Hey. Watcha doing there, kid?! I wouldn't do that if I were you. Ew! Yucky. This water's salty. [PILAF] Whoa! [PEOPLE] Hail, Pilaf. Hail, the Emperor. Hail, Pilaf. [ATTENDANT] Make way for Emperor Pilaf, the supreme ruler of the world! [PILAF chuckles] Thank you! Thank you! --[SHU] Emperor Pilaf! --[PILAF] Huh? [SHU] Emperor Pilaf! What?! Spit it out. Did you get the Dragon Ball?! [SHU] Not exactly. It's like this. There was a slight problem with the information, Sire. And?! It was bogus. Yeah. We were nearly killed by a huge pack of wolves. And then we crashed, Sire. Some crazy kid... he kicked our plane. --[PILAF] Silence. --[SHU] It was horrible. [SHU and MAI] Aah! I'm sick of your lame-brained excuses! Now get out of here and get that Dragon Ball, if it's the last thing you do! Understand?! [SHU and MAI] Sir! [phone ringing] [ALL] Huh?! [PILAF] The hotline. Hello?! What's that you say?! [PILAF] You're kidding?! And where is it?! I see. Well done. Another Dragon Ball. We're in luck. An old hermit named Roshi has it. No one's even guarding it! But... does he have any wolves?! [PILAF] No, you dunder-head. He lives on an island in the middle of the sea. Wolves don't go there. We'd better be careful. Could be another bum-steer! Never mind that! Go get me that Dragon Ball! [SHU and MAI] Yes, sir. --[SHU] Huh? --[MAI] Sire! [MAI] You've never come with us on a mission before. You keep screwing up. I can't trust you two on your own anymore. [aircraft noise] [SHU] Engaging thrusters. [SHU] Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Please fasten your seatbelts and remain seated at all times. Forget the seatbelts. It's too narrow in here. Yeah, it's a little stuffy. That's cause there's one too many in here. What did you say?! I said "I read you loud and clear." [BULMA] Ahh! I get so relaxed when I'm on the beach. [GOKU] Yeah! You're not talking nearly as much. [BULMA] Huh? Hey, what's that?! Whatever it is, it's moving toward us. [GOKU] It's the turtle! And he's got someone on his back. [BULMA] Wow. It's like you've got super-vision or something! Pretty cool, Goku. [GOKU] Hey, Turtle. Over here. [OLD MAN] Doesn't he realize that they're the only one's on the beach? [TURTLE] Ahoy, there. Heh, heh. Sorry I kept you waiting. [TURTLE] I had to go get my Master. [BULMA] Man! Check that guy out. [sighs] Well, hello there, kids. [BULMA] Hi. How's it going?! Welcome ashore. What a cool outfit. [OLD MAN] Kids, I want to thank you for helping my turtle! It was our pleasure, Mister. I'm Roshi! The turtle hermit. Uh... A turtle hermit? Which one of these kids helped you? It's that little boy, there. You're a very brave boy. I have a gift I want to give you as a token of my gratitude. Hear that, Goku? Come, Magic Carpet. [gasps] Magic carpet?! [GOKU] What in the world is a magic carpet? [BULMA] What's a magic carpet? It's a carpet you can sit on and fly anywhere you want. [BULMA] They're not real, though. At least, I don't think they are. [TURTLE] Hey! Uhh, Master. Hold on. You took the Magic Carpet to the cleaners. Hey, that's right. You've got a good point there, Turtle. Hmm. I knew it. They're not real. The other option is the Flying Nimbus, but am I really ready to part with it?! Why not?! If you can ride it, it's yours. Come to me, Flying Nimbus! He's odd. He's not odd. He's nuts. [ROSHI] Now where is that cloud?! [ROSHI] Oh, there it is. It's about time. See! [ROSHI] She's a beauty, isn't she?! --[BULMA] Hm?! --[GOKU] Whoa! [GOKU] Look, Bulma! Isn't it neat-o?! [BULMA] Yeah! How strange! Wow. Don't be afraid! She's as sweet as candy. --[BULMA] Hm. --[GOKU] Gosh. [GOKU] It's so light and puffy. Do you mind if I have a taste?! You don't eat it, you little baboon. What does this thing do?! If you can manage to sit on this cloud it can fly you wherever you want. There's got to be some kind of hitch. You wouldn't be giving it away. Something's wrong with it, right?! Hm?! There's nothing wrong with this cloud. Hey. Can I try to ride it now? Sure, why not?! But... I must warn you. You have to be pure of heart to ride this cloud. [GOKU] Hm? Yep, otherwise it won't let you get on it. It's picky that way. Wow. Here. Let an old man show you how it's done! [ROSHI grunts] [laughs] [laughs] [TURTLE] Are you okay, Master?! You must have done something naughty. Be quiet. Now let me try it. [BOTH] Huh?! [GOKU] Wow. Yeah! Alright. I did it! I did it! --[GOKU] I really did it! --[TURTLE] He did it, Master. I'll be darned. There goes my cloud. I did it! Woo hoo! [SHU humming] [PILAF] Shut up, Shu! Pay attention. [SHU] Sorry, Sire. Is there any sign of the island yet? [MAI] Negative. Hey. There it is. Take her down. [SHU] Right away, Sire! [ALL] Huh? [MAI, SHU, and PILAF scream] [MAI] Wow. Nice house for a turtle-hermit. [SHU] Yeah, I wonder if he's hiring? You imbecile! Let's get on with it! Get the Dragon Ball and don't you dare screw up! [SHU and MAI] Sir! [PILAF] Now follow me. [running breaths] [laughs] Telegram. Hello?! [PILAF] Special delivery. Telegram! Hello?! Is anybody home?! Good. The place is empty. [chuckles] [SHU] I got a great idea. Let's just break in. "Break in"?! I like your style, Shu. But when in the presence of a brilliant mind, there is seldom need for brute force. Now. Where did I put that thing?! Oh, yeah. Here it is. [PILAF] My Universal Key is just the thing for this job. We could smash right in, but hey! That's not the way I operate. [PILAF] There. That's it. Hey. What's the deal?! [grunting] Look Emperor! This window was open the whole time! Huh? I'll open the door... Wait. Ah! Eh... [GOKU laughing] Yeah, whoa! [laughs] Wee! All right! Yeah. [chuckles] Whoa! [laughing continues] Whoa! Whoopie! Whoopie! Hey, down there. Whoa! Wow. It's great. Thanks. I love it. [ROSHI] You fly that thing like you've had it your whole life. [chuckles] [GOKU] See ya. Hey, yo. What about me?! Hm? Aren't you going to give me a gift, too?! Whatd'ya say?! Did this young lady help you as well?! Oh, no. Just the boy. [BULMA] Hey! What about the seawater I gave you?! [ROSHI] Hmm... I think I have to side with Turtle on this one... But I could be persuaded to change my mind... [ROSHI] For instance... if, uh, you were to let me see your underwear... You wanna see my... Master. What are you doing?! [BULMA] You can't be serious! Eh huh! Have you forgotten your code, Master. Please. That's wrong. Dead wrong. Oh hush up, will ya? Can't a master take a break from training and have a little fun? Now I understand why you couldn't ride your cloud... Bite your tongue. [BULMA] This is so embarrassing... I can't believe I'm... doing this... [ROSHI and TURTLE] Aah! [yells] Ta da! [grunts] There. Done.  That's it. Oh, my eyes... I think I'm blind... I'm gonna faint... It serves you right! All right. So, where's my gift at?! Oh, right! Sure! The gift! Well... I have one in mind! [ROSHI] Let's see, I could give her the... No, not that, the wheels fell off... Well, what about the... [BULMA] Huh? Nevermind. Nevermind! I know what I want! Mm. Yeah? You do? What? That! I want that! That thing right there that's hanging around your neck! What? This?! You sure you want this old thing? I found it washed up on my island a long time ago. Oh, it's beautiful... [BULMA] The three-star ball. I can't believe it. [BULMA] Hey! Goku! [GOKU] Huh? [BULMA] Come here! I've got something to show you. [GOKU] Okay! What? Look. It's another Dragon Ball! Ah...! It sure is, isn't it! Our fourth Dragon Ball. A Dragon... What'd you call it? So aren't you glad that we decided to help the turtle now?! It paid off. I sure am. You were so right. And now just three more then, wish time! [GOKU] Yeah. What?! That thing grants wishes?! [GOKU] What a great day. Thank you. We really love our gifts. You're a kind-hearted and generous man. Thanks so much. I never said you could have the ball. [BULMA] But you said you were going to give me a gift. Can I have it? Please?! Aw, come on. There! Huh? [laughs] Ehhh...! [ROSHI] I give up. It's yours. Take it. Yay! [laughs] Woo-hoo-hoo! Oh-ho! [engine revs] [GOKU] Goodbye, Turtle Hermit. --[BULMA] So long.  --[GOKU] Thanks a lot. --[BULMA] Bye, bye. --[GOKU] See ya later. [ROSHI] Boy! I tell ya, these kids nowadays. They're like little piranhas. I was lucky to get out of there with my staff and sandals. [tires screech] [BULMA] Man! I never thought things would be going this well! We only need three more Dragon Balls. I guess it was meant to be, kiddo. Ahh! Wow! I wish Grandpa could see me now. [BULMA screams] [GOKU] Hold on Bulma, I'm coming! What's going on in here? What's wrong?! M-M-My underwear was here on the floor... Uh... I'm afraid to look. Awe... They're not there! [BULMA] Oh, that means on the beach... that old man... oh boy... Oh, is that all? Well that's okay, Bulma. That's right where I put 'em! What are you talking about? After I took 'em off this morning. Are you saying that you took my underwear off while I was sleeping this morning?! Huh?! [GOKU] I sure did. These underwear?! Yep! They're the ones. Huh? [BULMA grunting] [GOKU] What are you doing, Bulma?! [BULMA yells] [GOKU] Ow, ow! Owie! Ow! [GAY-TOR humming] Huh? Hmm. Mm. [MAI] This is disgusting. Ugh! [PILAF] Darn it. Where is that Dragon Ball?! [SHU] It's not up here, Sire. Or down here. [MAI] It's not in the kitchen either, Emperor. It's possible that someone tipped him off. [PILAF] I wonder... Wait here! [PILAF] Huh? [exhales loudly] [PILAF] Hey, there. Nice day, isn't it?! Huh? [yells] You'd better tell me what I want to know, or I'll make a green handbag out of you! Okay... Where did this "Roshi the Turtle Hermit" go? Master Roshi? He's right there, buddy. Right where?! Aaah! [PILAF] Shu! Mai! [MAI] What is it?! [PILAF] Keep me covered. I don't think we've met. Hi. Hi. Now hand it over. The Dragon Ball. What ball?! [SHU] Yeah! That's right, needle-nose. [MAI] You heard the man. Now cough it up. Dragon...? Oh, I remember. I just gave it to that pretty girl on the beach. [PILAF] Are you kidding?! [ROSHI] Seriously. She wouldn't leave me alone until I gave it to her. She was nuts about that ball because of some crazy wish. [SHU] Huh?! --[MAI] Huh?! --[SHU] Doesn't sound good. I want to know where that girl is at. [ROSHI] I don't know. But I just said goodbye to her --[ROSHI] by the sh--shore... --[PILAF] She couldn't have gotten too far! Come on! Let's go. [SHU and MAI] Right. Engaging amphibious transformation. [PILAF] Uh, hello there! Yoo, hoo. Would you mind giving us a little push?! [ROSHI] Anything to get you off my island, you blue-faced dwarf! [PILAF] Hurry up! [ROSHI] Yeah, yeah! Keep your hat on. [ROSHI grunts] Oopsie, Daisy! [chuckles] [ROSHI] Bon voyage. [ROSHI] Goodbye! Enjoy the bottom of the sea. [PILAF] Thank you. Those three deserve the hole I put in their side. Too bad. It was a nice plane. [PILAF] Shu! Step on it. We're going too slow. [SHU] Eye, eye, skipper. [BULMA] Ready and presto. [GOKU yells] [BULMA] Now that's what I call house-cleaning. [chuckles] [GOKU] Don't scare me like that, Bulma. [BULMA] Okay! I'll warn you next time. I guess we'll both take the Flying Nimbus. It'll be faster. [GOKU] But didn't Master Roshi say you have to be pure of heart to ride the Flying Nimbus? What's that supposed to mean?! I'm probably the purest person you know. [GOKU] All right. [GOKU] Go ahead! Give it a try. [BULMA] Uh...! Uh! Pure, huh?! [chuckles] Ooh! Now my clothes are dirty. Darn it. I didn't want to ride that stupid cloud anyway. [GOKU] Kind of slow, huh?! [BULMA] Oh, just hush up. Nobody likes a show-off, you know. [SHU] There's that smell again... [MAI] Man! That's toxic. [PILAF] Oh, yeah. Well, whoever smelt it dealt it. Right, Shu?! [SHU] Yes, Sire. Huh?! [NARRATOR] As the villains sink with the setting sun, our heroes' adventure continues. Join us again next time as Goku and Bulma once again further their quest to unite the seven magic Dragon Balls.
