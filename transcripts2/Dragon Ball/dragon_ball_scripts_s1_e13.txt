Ahhh! Boo! Boo! [APE GOKU roaring] [ALL screaming] All right, come on, let's go! There's no time to lose! [BULMA] Well, then give me a hand here, you big lummox! Uh... What? Do you mean me? [BULMA] Who do you think I mean? Waah! [SHU] Wait up, Mai! [PILAF] Hurry, Shu! [SHU] I am! [MAI] Come on... What's wrong with this thing? Why won't it start?! Maybe because you're not yelling loud enough? Come on! Come on! Go! Go! I'm doing my best, Emperor! She's just being stubborn! [APE GOKU roaring] [PILAF screaming] It's all over! We're doomed! I did it! [SHU] Come on, Mai! [PILAF] Faster! [MAI] Here we go! [ALL laughing] [ALL screaming] Oh, Bulma! Are you okay?! What's the matter, kid? It's my leg! [OOLONG] Don't worry, I'll get you! Hey, Don Juan! Can't you see I need a hand here? I-I'm sorry, I just... can't. [PUAR] Come on, Yamcha. You can do it! What are you waiting for?! [PUAR] Yamcha! Come on! [YAMCHA growling] Oh boy! [APE GOKU roaring] [YAMCHA screaming] [roaring] [roaring] I just can't bear to watch my castle being destroyed like this! My insurance premiums are gonna go through the roof... Turn around! [MAI and SHU] Huh?! You heard me! Go back! We're going to beat that big monkey even if we have to ram this plane up its nose! Oh, but, Emperor! Don't you want to reconsider, sir? [PILAF] Where's the eject button?! You're getting out! [MAI] Sorry, sir! Sorry! [panting] I did it! I... I did it! I can't... believe... I... did it Well, I can... Thanks for playing my knight in shining armor... I can't believe I actually touched a girl... And I'm still all right! Die! Die! Goku! Oh no! So he's a big hairy ape! That's no reason to shoot him! Eat lead, you big baboon! [BULMA whimpering] [APE GOKU roaring] [roaring] [roaring continues] Why, our puny gun is totally useless! Now I just think we made him really mad! All right then, it's time we played our trump card... Fire the heat-seeking missile! Right! [MAI] Easy, big boy... That's it! Locked on target... Firing! Oh no! [SHU] Bulls-eye! [PILAF laughing] [screaming] [BULMA gasps] Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! I did it! It worked! I killed him! Is... Is Goku dead? Oh, Goku... [PILAF] Like I always say: 'The bigger they are, the harder they fall'! That'll teach him not to monkey with me! Wow, he sure is huge! and smelly... More importantly, why did he have to go and wreck my castle? Just my luck! It took me ten years to build that castle... and now it's gone! Gone! [PILAF] I hate you, you... You overgrown ape! It's gone! Gone! Gone! Gone! [screaming] It's moving! [screaming] [PILAF screaming] [APE GOKU roaring] He's alive! Hurry! It's coming right for us! [SHU whimpering] [PILAF whimpering] Well at least my head doesn't hurt... [YAMCHA panting] Wow, that was close... No kidding! Too close! And it doesn't look like Goku's finished yet! [APE GOKU roaring] I guess we'd better hide out 'til morning when the moon goes down... Uhh, let's go that way! [YAMCHA] Yeah... [BULMA] Hey! Aren't you guys forgetting something...? Bulma! Are you okay?! [YAMCHA grunting] [YAMCHA] No, it won't budge! Oh no... [distant crashing] [APE GOKU roaring] [OOLONG screaming] Here he comes! Quick! [grunting] [roaring] [OOLONG] Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! [YAMCHA grunting] Thanks, Yamcha! [YAMCHA] No problem! [OOLONG] Come on! [BULMA screaming] Bulma! [BULMA] Goku! Look! It's me! Put me down! [BULMA screaming] [roaring] [screaming] I guess it's up to me now to save her... Yamcha, didn't you say that Goku's weak point is his tail? Yeah! That's it, Puar! [YAMCHA] It's time... For my Wolf Fang Fist! Hyaah! Ha, ha, ha! [slurping] [YAMCHA shouting] Huh?! [YAMCHA screaming] [roaring] [YAMCHA screaming] [roaring] [BULMA screaming] Hold on, Yamcha! We're coming! [roaring] [growling] [ALL] Huh?! Quick, Puar! Now's our chance! Turn into a giant pair of scissors and snip off his tail! Right! [APE GOKU roaring] [BULMA] Catch me! [growling] [growling] Well he's back to himself! Uh... Well almost... [GOKU snoring] [PILAF] So that little kid caused all of this? Why didn't one of you morons kill him when you had the chance? [SHU] You wanted to let them bake, sire! [PILAF] Oh yeah... But this is still all your fault! Is that clear? [MAI and SHU] Yes, sire... [PILAF] My poor castle! [hysterical whimpering] [PILAF wailing] My castle! [PILAF sobbing] [PILAF laughing] It's not over yet! [PILAF] Here... and here. Now, listen carefully, you two. My Great-Granddaddy Pilaf used to say there's no sense crying over your losses until you've gotten your revenge. So, let's get our revenge and let the crying begin! Wow, what a guy! Yeah, he must've been quite an inspiration. [PILAF] All right! Now let's get those trouble makers! [MAI] Yeah! [SHU] Let's do it! [MAI and SHU] Huh?! Hey, Emperor Pilaf! Where are you going, sire? Never mind me, you fools! Just get those pesky kids! And remember the ageless words of my dear Great-Granddaddy Pilaf! [MAI and SHU] Wait up! [GOKU snoring] That was quite a predicament that Goku managed to get us into, huh? Yeah, but if he hadn't changed into that monster we would have all been barbecued in Pilaf's cell! We'd better not tell him that he stomped his grandpa to death... It would just break his little heart. Did you guys know a terrible monster comes out when the moon is full? But I'm not making it up, Bulma! My Grandpa was trampled to death by that horrible monster. Oh... It's just so hard to believe... So what's the deal? Is Goku some kind of alien? He looks normal enough... I have a feeling he'll be quite normal now that his tail's been cut off. [BULMA] I sure hope so. I've got enough friends with weird hang-ups already! Not mentioning any names, of course... Oh boy, he's waking up! [GOKU yawning] Goodness! Good morning, kid. Hi! So, feeling light-hearted this morning, are we? Yeah! [GOKU] My-My clothes are gone! You don't remember anything, do you, Goku? Huh? How about sharing some of your clothes with Goku, Oolong? Anything but my undies, made of the finest cotton in the universe, and supremely comfortable! Oolong! Well, all right then, he can borrow my pants. [PUAR snoring] [OOLONG] Check him out! Now that's a definite improvement! That's style! Your legs are a lot shorter than mine are. Hey! What's with the wise-crack, huh?! Uh? W-Wuh--? Uh, didn't mean to frighten you there, kid. You didn't. I just can't seem to stand up! That's not too surprising. You probably just need to spend a little time learning how to balance without your tail. Why would I wanna do that? Wha--? Oh, no way! My tail's gone you guys! [GOKU] Oh, where could it have gone? I can't believe it! It's really gone you guys! I'm sure it was there last night! It's just disappeared! Vanished! I don't know! Guess I should wait for it to come back... You are one strange, little kid, Goku. [GOKU] Where's my... uh... Power Pole? Oh, it's that way... Where the castle used to be. [GOKU] It's demolished! I sure hope... my Power Pole's still out here! Wah! Ow... Wah! What are we gonna do now? We can't look for the Dragon Balls for a whole year, so... I guess we should just go our separate ways, huh? Well, yeah, that seems like the thing to do. Hey, it's time to wake up, my furry, little friend. [BULMA] Oh well. I guess it's going to be a whole year before I can have my wish granted for a new boyfriend... [YAMCHA] So, I've got to spend another year acting like a lunk-head everytime a pretty girl comes around... [YAMCHA] I'll never get a girlfriend! [BULMA sighs] [YAMCHA] Hmm! --Hm? --Huh? [GOKU laughing] Ugh! [GOKU] Hey Oolong, I found it! Is there something bugging you, Oolong? Yeah, get a load of Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee! [laughing] It looks like they're hearing music... Boy, that's sure weird... Ooh! Uh! Oh no! Did I hurt you, Bulma? Let me see... [BULMA] Yeah, a little, but it's okay... I feel fine now... [BULMA] You saved my life, remember? Uhm, ahem! I don't mean to interrupt you guys, but um... [YAMCHA laughing] I think Yamcha and I've decided that we'd like to spend a little more time together... [YAMCHA laughing] So, why don't we all go back to the city? Pretty cool idea, huh? That sounds good. But I think I'm gonna go to Master Roshi's and train like my Grandpa did. I wanna get strong! But Goku, you're the strongest kid I know... Yeah, but when I hit that castle it didn't even shake! So if someone else can come along and tear the whole thing down, I really need to go and train! What are you talking about, Goku? You're the one who destr-mmmph! We'll miss you, Goku... And what about you, Oolong? Well, I dunno. Do you think I look like a big city pig? Are you kidding? You'll be the talk of the town! Especially with that underwear on your head! You're just jealous 'coz I got these from the dragon! [laughing] Oh well, I guess I'll go... You guys need me! I know! When a year goes by, let's go look for the Dragon Balls again! [BULMA] We don't need the Dragon Balls anymore, Goku! [laughter] [OOLONG spitting] Despicable! Hey, how will I ever be able to find my Grandpa's Dragon Ball if you're not there with your radar, Bulma? Well, I'll tell you what, kid. How about I just give you this radar as a going away present, to remind you of all the good times that we had together. Oh wow, thank you. Well, here goes. [YAMCHA] I guess this is goodbye, Goku... I want you to become just as strong as Master Roshi, okay? Okay. You know I'll never forget you, Goku. Aww. Flying Nimbus! Hey-hey! All right, Nimbus, to Master Roshi's, and step on it! You go get 'em, kid! You too, Oolong! [YAMCHA] Hold on, everyone! [GOKU laughing] [GOKU] Yeah! [GOKU laughing] [ALL] Buh-bye! [GOKU] Bye! See ya! I never thought that life could be such a neat adventure! [GOKU laughing] Go! [NARRATOR] Soon, Goku's skills will be put to the test when he joins Master Roshi and begins the rigors of Turtle Hermit Training! But what other challenges await our young hero? [NARRATOR] A new day dawns, and a new adventure begins, next time on Dragon Ball!
