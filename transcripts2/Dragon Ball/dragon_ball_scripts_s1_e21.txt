 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, the World Martial Arts Tournament began with its super intense elimination round! Over one hundred fighters entered the foot-flying fray, and Goku and Krillin plowed through them one by one! But hold on! Krillin and Goku aren't the only ones advancing to the finals...! Yamcha will be there too! [GOKU chuckles] [GOKU and KRILLIN chuckle] [GOKU] Excuse us please!

 [KRILLIN] Coming through!! [GOKU] Sorry about that! Oops! [KRILLIN] Oh! Watch your toes! I don't think we'll find Master Roshi any time soon when all we can see are people's pants legs! [GOKU] Hello, sir! Hm? Huh? Hmm... Can you help? Eh? Uhh... Huh... Hey, I found 'em, Krillin! [GOKU chuckles] Roshi! Where've you been all this time? Oh, uh, this place is like a cattle herd...

 I just went to the restroom and the toilet line was a mile long. Well, while you were out on your bathroom adventures, Krillin and Goku really kicked tail! Yeah and Yamcha made it too! Yes, from what I heard they just breezed through their matches. But I suspect the finals will be different. I got you something, Bulma. Huh? Why? [ROSHI] I saw this shirt in the gift shop, and it just screamed your name. You... bought me that? [ROSHI] It's a token of friendship! Wow! That's so sweet! [BULMA and ROSHI chuckle] And I got you this golden souvenir key chain, too! Oh, wow! Thank you...! I didn't know you could be so nice! [ROSHI] Now could you do a nice man a favor? As a friend? [BULMA groans] [ROSHI] Could you squeeze into that tight little shirt I got you and show off your curves a bit more...? You think? Yeah...? Yeah? [ROSHI giggles] [BULMA] Pervert!! [punch] [ROSHI yells] [ROSHI whimpers] Maybe you should have entered the tournament yourself, Bulma! [GOKU] Oolong! Huh? [GOKU and KRILLIN chuckle] [OOLONG] Goku...! Wowzas! You were incredible in there! For real! We were cheering the entire time! And I turned into a ladder! [GOKU] That's great! Huh? Well done, boys. Well done. Thank you! It was just like a dream.. But I knew we were going to win the whole time, of course. [BULLHORN GUY] The World Martial Arts Tournament will soon begin! If you're one of the eight finalists, please meet in the main hall immediately...! Thank you! Well you boys had better run along then. [GOKU] Yeah! Guess so. [GOKU] I'll look for you in the audience! [OOLONG] Do it for the glory, kid! Hmm. Now... [BULMA] That boy never ceases to amaze me... [OOLONG] Huh? Hey... The old man... went AWOL again! I swear there's something wrong with his head... [crowd cheering] [YAMCHA] So you saw Bulma and Puar? [GOKU] Yeah... Oh, and Bulma said, "Hi." Huh? [JACKIE CHUN] Hmm. So you're one of the fighters, huh? Well, that means we have something in common! Hehehe... [FIGHTER] Hmph. [JACKIE CHUN] Hmmm... [JACKIE CHUN chuckles] Hm? [GOKU sniffs] [KRILLIN] Who's the stink-bucket? [YAMCHA] That's Bacterian. [YAMCHA] He's got Herculean strength, but that comes second to his offensive odor! They say he's never taken a bath since the day he was born! [YAMCHA] His opponents can only fight with one hand because the other one has to hold their nose! He takes advantage of this to win! [KRILLIN] That's a dirty trick. [GOKU] I think I'm gonna pass out! Now can I have your attention, please...? I need you all here at the front! [GOKU and KRILLIN laugh] [ANNOUNCER] On second thought, mister, why don't you stay in the back? You'll be drawing lots to determine your opponents and the order of the fights, so come up when you're called. Let's keep this orderly and civilized, people. [JACKIE CHUN] Ehh... Sonny? [ANNOUNCER] Yes? --[RANFAN] Hey! --Why don't you be a pal and put me in the ring with her? --[ANNOUNCER] Eh? Huh? --[RANFAN] Oh... I don't take requests! [JACKIE CHUN thinking] Young people are so unreasonable... So, your name is... uh... Nem? Nam. A five. [ANNOUNCER] Let's see... I guess that puts you in fight number three... Now... Monster Beast Giran? [GIRAN] Ah. [ANNOUNCER] You drew number eight, that means the fourth fight. [ANNOUNCER] Bacterian? [ANNOUNCER] Number one... First fight. [ANNOUNCER] Yamcha? Yeah. [ANNOUNCER] Number four... That's fight two. Where's Krillin? Oh...! Here! Can you reach it... sir? I got one! [groans and shudders] [KRILLIN] Hu... Huh? [ANNOUNCER] Number two... That puts you in fight one against Bacterian! Now... Gaw-what? Gaw... Kay... Uh...? [GOKU] Uh... Uh... Come on now...! Gaw-kay-uh! [GOKU] Uh... Uh... Huh? Hmm... Six, seven, eight... We're not missing anybody... Uh... Sorry to butt in, but that spells Goku. Huh?! Heh... Oh... yeah... How silly of me... All right, people... Is there anyone in the house named Goku? Me! [ANNOUNCER] You've drawn number seven... That's the final fight. [ANNOUNCER] Ranfan? Mhmmm? [ANNOUNCER] Number six. Jackie Chun? Yo! Mm, mm... [ANNOUNCER] Number three! This will be single elimination... In a full, regulation-sized arena... You lose... if you fall outside of the ring, stay down for ten counts, or give up... But poking in the eyes or hitting in the private parts is not allowed! What parts are private? You know what I mean... It's the... things that make us boys! But what... aaaabout my parts? Gaaah! Okay everyone, I think that's enough questions for now! So just stay here and I'll come back when it's time. [GOKU] One more thing! Where's our lunch? [ANNOUNCER] Huh? Don't you think it's a bad idea to eat a meal right before your fight? You might get cramps that way! I will eat! Uhhh... Well, I'm sure we can round up something, don'tcha think? But of course... Come with me. Are you coming too? Uh... I think I'll pass... I'm too nervous to swallow. I finished it. Is there more? Now, ladies and gentlemen! Are you ready? That's right, people! It's time for the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament! Okay, and here are the big match-ups for the tournament's first round. First match: Bacterian versus Krillin! Second match: Jackie Chun versus Yamcha! Fight three: Ranfan versus Nam! And match four: Gaw-ku--no, uh-- Goku versus Giren!! The first match between Bacterian and Krillin will begin momentarily, so don't go to the lemonade stand! Before we get things fired up, let me remind you that this year's winner will receive a prize of five hundred thousand zeni! With that said, let's welcome the esteemed director of the Tournament, who has a few words of wisdom to start this baby off! Please go ahead, sir. [silence] [silence] [clears throat] Ruff! [ANNOUNCER] Isn't that profound?! And now, the first match of the tournament! Would the contestants please come down?! [crowd cheers] Just keep punching, Krillin. I'm positive you'll win! [ANNOUNCER] Fighting in the bright red uniform is Krillin! He's one of the youngest competitors we have this year! And fighting in the soiled brown briefs is Bacterian, who as you probably noticed, has a very distinctive odor about him! Smells like we got here just in time! It smells like we should have been late! Hope that boy beats Bacterian quick so we can get him off the stage! --[GOKU] Psst! Hey! --[KRILLIN] Hmm? [KRILLIN laughs] I'll be cheering for you from up here! [GOKU laughs] Okay, guys! Let's try to keep this nice and clean... [ANNOUNCER] All right, scratch that. It's clearly not possible. So, uh, just try not to get anything on the audience, okay? Let's get those punches... flying! [BACTERIAN] Hello, boy! You come closer! Yes? [BACTERIAN] Huh...? I miss you... Tricky! [BACTERIAN] Now... I've got some trickies too! [BACTERIAN] And here... Try this! [BULMA] Oh... Vomit! [BACTERIAN] Smelly finger!!! [ANNOUNCER] And Krillin goes down after he's hit by the smelly finger attack! [MONK] One...! Two...! Three...! [ANNOUNCER] It seems the horrid smell is too much for the little warrior! [ANNOUNCER] It's an assault on his senses! [BULMA] I think I've been traumatized... [OOLONG] Get up Krillin! [various cheers for KRILLIN] [BACTERIAN] You say good-bye! [ANNOUNCER] Bacterian has caught his opponent in a terrible choke-hold! Krillin's smoothly-shaved head is looking like a cherry! [KRILLIN groans] [ANNOUNCER] No, wait! A blueberry! Quick, Krillin...! Hit his arms away from you! [KRILLIN struggles] [MONK] One...! Two...! [BACTERIAN] You made... me hurt! [ANNOUNCER] Krillin made a strong counter assault! But now he's dangerously close to a ring-out! [BACTERIAN] Up and down! And up and down! Up and down! Up and down! Up and down!... [ANNOUNCER] What's this?! Krillin seems to have Bacterian by the pant-seat! [BACTERIAN] Here's a surprise! [BACTERIAN grunts] [ANNOUNCER] Oh! What cruelty...! Bacterian has resorted to chemical warfare...! This could be the end! Oh, my goodness! How can one person do so many disgusting things? [ANNOUNCER] Bacterian just keeps on stomping! [ANNOUNCER] Wow, folks...! I've never seen a beating so ruthless! And Krillin is too stunned from the body odor to defend himself! [BULMA] It's so awful! [BACTERIAN] I am tricky!! [BACTERIAN guffaws] [MONK] One...! Two...! [BULMA] Go...! Go...! [PUAR] Please! [ALL THREE] Krillin! Krillin! Krillin! Krillin...! [CROWD] Krillin! Krillin! Krillin! Krillin!... [MONK] Five...! Six...! Come on...! It's not over yet! Uh... Uh...! Krillin! Hey! Focus your mind and you won't smell him...! Just think about it! You don't have a nose, remember?! [KRILLIN shudders] Hey...! He's right! [MONK] Nine...! [ANNOUNCER] Hold on, folks! Krillin has stood up! It seems he's caught his second wind after Bacterian's breaking wind! How does this boy do it? Thanks for the tip, Goku! Now... My turn! Okay, stinky not enough for you? Then here's super-special tricky! [ANNOUNCER] Oh, my...! Could it be...? Bacterian is now preparing for his most notorious attack move...! It's the deep-throated, mucous-filled loogie of death...! No opponent has ever withstood it! [BACTERIAN] I'm done... for! [ANNOUNCER] What a roller coaster, folks! Krillin has won the round with a come-from-behind knockout! Yeah!! [crowd cheers] [GOKU & KRILLIN] We made it! We made it! We made it! Awesome job, Krillin! Thank you, Goku! [GOKU & KRILLIN laugh and cheer] [ANNOUNCER] Well! If we learned anything from this match, it's that no matter how used you are to your own stench, you'll always be stunned by someone else's! Now, I just hope they can clean up the arena! [cheering continues] [NARRATOR] So, after an exciting--and unusual-- round of fighting, Krillin has advanced from the first round of Tournament play! But with the strangeness of this match, one can only wonder what the next fights will have in store! Don't miss the next Dragon Ball!
