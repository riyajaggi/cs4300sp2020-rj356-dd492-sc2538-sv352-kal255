 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, the long awaited World Martial Arts Tournament finally started up! From all across the globe, fighters and fans gathered to take part in the earth's craziest display of Martial Arts know-how. [BULLHORN GUY] No pushing! It makes me nervous! I'm sorry but the audience is not allowed inside the elimination round area! It would be a major fire hazard and-- Well then how are we supposed

 to see our friends and boyfriends fighting?!! Just close your eyes and pretend you're there! [CHAIRMAN] Hello? Hello? Testing, one... two... okay... Well... first we'd like to thank each one of you fighters for coming all this way to the Tournament because of course if you didn't come there wouldn't be much of a show to watch... If anyone here is of the counting nature, you may have noticed that there are one hundred and thirty seven fighters packed into this hall, representing countries and species from all over the world... [KRILLIN] One hundred and thirty seven??

 And half of them have kneecaps taller than I am! [CHAIRMAN] Unfortunately... Out of all you guys here only eight will get a chance to fight in front of the crowds in the Tournament finals! So fight hard in the elimination round and let's try to not have any whining! Gee, what's the point of windows when you can't reach them? Change into a stool or something! [OOLONG] Whoa Bulma! I don't just change on command! Get Puar to do it! Don't be a baby Oolong! I changed the last four times! It's your turn! Now get down there! Come on...! Why me?! I'll yell piggy! [OOLONG thinking] Some things never change... the wicked mistress and her poor pig slave... Okay...! But I ain't changing into a stool! [BULMA] Fine. What ever. [OOLONG thinking] Guess that's why mountain climbers don't wear skirts... [BULMA] I still can't see! Lift me higher! Hey...! Move it! [grunting] [BULMA] I can see! I can see inside! [OOLONG] Great, Bulma. That's the important thing... I mean... who cares if my spine's cracking... [CHAIRMAN] Now listen to the rules carefully because I can't stand repeating myself... You will be divided into four tournament blocks and the top two from each block will advance to the finals. [CHAIRMAN] We'll be playing single elimination... A person loses when they land outside the ring, lose consciousness, or says "I give up." But killing your opponent is strictly forbidden. Anyone who does so will be disqualified! And no weapons, either! Claws may be used but only if they're natural! Fights that aren't finished in under one minute will be decided by points! Now, please move to the boxes and take a number... You can look on the boards to find your place. And please, no trading... [KRILLIN] Ninety three for me... What did you get? A... seven and a zero... [YAMCHA] Looks like you're both in block three. Huh? Oh no...! That's bad...! I don't want to go up against Goku! But we're on opposite ends so you don't have to fight me! [KRILLIN] Oh! Too bad... [GOKU] What's your number Yamcha? I'm thirty five... That's block two. [GOKU] Is that good? [YAMCHA] Actually it's just perfect 'cause I didn't want to be put in the same tournament block as you. [GOKU] But why not? Ah... So you were scared just like me! That's not it... I just want to wait for the real tournament... That's where the ring is bigger and there's no time limit to stop us... I've been waiting for this Goku, so you better make it through... Oh, I'll make it! Well then, I'll see you in the ring! [KRILLIN] How in the world can you and that Yamcha guy be so confident... ...when we're surrounded by like, twenty thousand pounds of muscle? 'Cause none of these guys were trained by Master Roshi like we were! But Goku, the old man never taught us to fight! He just gave us dirt to move around! Don't worry Krillin I bet if we try hard enough we'll be okay! Right... Dandy... Hello everyone, I'm going to be your ref today so if I could get fighters number 69 and 70 into the ring now that'd be super... Hey... Seventy's my number... Good luck, Goku! Oh... Watch out... We got a top competitor from the diaper brigade! I just hope he doesn't make a mess on the fighting ring floor... Goku's already up... Now I'll finally have the chance to see what fighting tricks he learned from that crazy old man. Look, it's Goku's turn! [grunting] Aaaah... [OOLONG thinking] Well that's an interesting angle... Oolong, just stay put! It's too bad I'm not a pervert! Eh. Where's my fighter? [GOKU] Right here! [MR. MUSTACHE] What is this, a joke fight? I've fallen on my rump and squished bugs bigger than you are! Is that so? You have one minute to fight... Hah! I just need one second to crush this pest between my thumb and forefinger! Begin. Huh? Oh, I really crushed him! No, I'm okay! Huh? [surprised murmuring] Unreal!! Mhmm!! Awesome...! Goku knocked him flat!! [OOLONG] Careful! Don't... look...! Huh? Hey... is there a reason you keep acting like a weirdo down there? Number seventy advances... Uh... Guys, what just happened there? The big oaf got carried away and lost his balance! That's what I call embarrassing...! Beat by a baby! [YAMCHA thinking] That was no accident... Goku knocked him down with one touch...! Master Roshi's technique, no doubt... Wow...! It sure was lucky how he fell out of the ring! Not really... What do you mean? Krillin... I'm thinking we shouldn't use our full strength, at least not yet... Hold on... Why not? It could be bad! [ORIN PUPIL 1] What do we have here? It's our old punching bag! H-Hello... It's been a long time since I've seen you Krillin, when you ran crying out of the Orin Temple! [KRILLIN chuckles weakly] But look...! His new clothes are sooo pretty! Now surely you're not trying to fight in the World Martial Arts Tournament! [KRILLIN] Well yeah, um, I was thinking about it... How horrible...! Making all these real fighters waste their time on you! [ORIN PUPIL 1] Have you forgotten what we taught you? That runts are always runts? No... I remember... [ORIN PUPIL 2] Oh look! His number's 93! Would you like to know who your opponent's gonna be? Uhhh... You're lookin' at him! Ehhh? Just like old times... huh? Just try not to be too hard on me, Krillin! Why'd you let them talk to you like that? Cause... Cause everything they say about me is right, Goku! They've known me longer than anyone. They know the truth... Maybe... I should drop out... No, you won't...! You're going to give that guy all you've got! But I thought you said it'd be bad if we used our full strength here. We'll take a time-out from that rule because those guys need to know what you're made of...! So you show 'em! Hey...! There he is! There's Yamcha! Where...? Show me! He's there by the number 2 sign...! You see him? [BULMA] Oh I found him! Yamcha!!! [BULMA] Hey sweetie! Can you hear me! Yamcha!! [BULMA] Come on Yamcha! Don't you want to wave? [OOLONG] Whoa there!!! [OOLONG] Abandon ship! Pig going down! My poor behind! [BULMA] Aahh! I've gone blind!! Aaa! Help me! There's something on my face! [MAN 1] Would ya look at that...? [MAN 2] I am! I am! [BULMA] Somebody give me hand...! I can't see anything! Hey!!! What is this, Peeping Tom day?! It's you...! Why wouldn't you just let go of my face?! I'm sorry... I grab when I'm scared! I just love... fighting! Thanks... I am not speaking to you Oolong. [OOLONG] What? After I defended you from that drooling army of perverts? Yeah, somehow I can't see it as honorable when you're getting free looks of your own! [OOLONG] Come on! Just think of it as payment for my services! Well then I'm not buying the ice cream! Fine... Take checks? So I wonder where Master Roshi went, you guys. He's been gone for quite a while. [BULMA] Humph! That old creep's probably hiding out in the ladies' rest room. I'm more concerned about getting to see that elimination round! My shoulders are officially off limits! Oh, that's too bad. I was gonna take you to the candy store if you turned into a ladder. Oooh baby! [REFEREE] Gee we're really making progress here aren't we? Well let's get fighters number 93 and 94 in the ring please! Oh gosh, that's me! You can do it Krillin! Right... I have to admit that I'm kind of jealous you get to be in the ring with him. Don't worry. I'll give 'em a good slap for you! I bet you'll be surprised at what you can do! Just give him a good tap! I think my body went numb. You didn't run away this time... I can't say that's a healthy move, but at least your less of a chicken! Beeeegin! Which bone should I break first? [screaming] Huh? Well, I'd say 93 is the winner... You see? Delivering milk and moving dirt must be good training after all! And I bet those guys won't call you runt from now on! Guess not... Well Bulma, I hope you're ready to visit the candy store...! Change now! [OOLONG] To the windows, men!! Hey look, there's a hole in the wall! Alright...! So we don't need you after all, Oolong! [OOLONG thinking] Who likes candy, anyway? [BULMA] Look! Yamcha's about to fight! Yay! Go get him Yamcha!!! Ha ha! I'll give you a freebie! Just try and hurt me! [chuckles] How's that...? [BALD REFEREE] Knock out...! 35 advances! [GOKU] Yamcha's really doing well! We've gotta' make it to the finals now! You bet! [NARRATOR] And so it is! After months of sharks and wasp bites, Goku and Krillin are finally putting Master Roshi's training to the test! And they're kicking some serious butt! Number 70 wins! Yay Goku! [REFEREE] Begin! [GOKU] Say...! Nice posture! Thanks! Krillin? What are the chances he'll live through that? Not too likely... Ha! Nice try...! Sucker! Hahahaha. Now let's see, what sort of counterattack should I use... Hmmm... How did you... That was my famous Dragon Stomp! Right! Here I come!! Okay, I give up! I give up now! Well that... was easy... [NARRATOR] And while the boys plowed through the fighters in Ring 3, Yamcha continued to take victories of his own! And their path to the final Tournament became more and more secure. [NARRATOR] On and on, knockout after knockout, until the eliminations came down to the final, deciding bouts! Whoever wins this fight will be the first from Ring Two to advance to the finals! Fighters 35 and 40, please take your positions! [GOKU] Do your best, Yamcha! It's Wolf Fang Fist time! You humans come up with the wildest names to make your moves sound tough... But I'll show you how a real wolf attacks! Oh my Yamcha! Oh gosh...! Is he hurt?! [BALD REFEREE] And that's a win! 35 has just earned a spot in the big show! Whoa...! Yamcha's full of surprises! That fight gave me indigestion... He won! I just knew he would! Way to go! Thank you...! Cool move, right? Yeah! [REFEREE] We're into the final stretch, you guys...! Fighters number 70 and 83 please come to the ring! Winner of this match will go on to the Tournament...! How exciting! That's my number! Go get 'em! You know it! Goku! Throw him from the ring! That sounds fun! [LION FIST thinking] And now for the sacred stance of the Lion Fang Fist! Begin! [LION FIST thinking] What strange fighting posture! He's unguarded on all sides! Just come and hit me if you want to, mister! Where'd he go! Head's up!! Get ready! Where's your technique? [REFEREE] Out of the ring! 70 advances! You'll be in the tournament for sure! Those were some nice moves! It was so much fun! [YAMCHA thinking] I always knew Goku was strong, but there's something different now... [REFEREE] Now for the last match in the Ring 3 Bracket...! Numbers 93 and 97 please report! Okay...! Just take care of this guy and we'll go to the finals together! Right! Begin! [BEAR] Make the pain stop... [REFEREE] Fighter 97 surrenders! That means 90 is on to the finals! [KRILLIN] I did it! I did it! [GOKU and KRILLIN] Going to the tournament! We're going to the tournament! [YAMCHA] And Krillin is a good fighter, too... This is gonna be a long day! So all of them advanced...! Neat-o! I'm so happy! [ROSHI] So am I...! Well... About time you showed up! [NARRATOR] So the elimination round has ended with quite favorable results...! Goku, Krillin, and Yamcha have all advanced to the finals...! Soon they'll be fighting against the toughest warriors in the world...! The ring will be bigger, the time limit will be gone, and there'll be thousands of fans cheering them on! There's no doubt about it... The best is yet to come, on Dragon Ball!
