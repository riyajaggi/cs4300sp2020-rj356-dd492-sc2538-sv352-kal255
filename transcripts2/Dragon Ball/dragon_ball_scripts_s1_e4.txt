 [GOKU] Weeeee! Ho ho ho! Woah, ha ha ha! [BULMA] Hm? Waaah! [BULMA] Goku, wait for me! [NARRATOR] Goku and Bulma have already collected four of the seven magic Dragon Balls. Now, with only three more to find before they can make their wish, our heroes race towards the location of the fifth Dragon Ball, which, according to Bulma's radar, isn't far off.

 [engine roaring] [GOKU] Whoo, hooo! Ha ha ha! Hey, Squirt! Pay attention to where you're going! You're not invincible, you know! [BULMA screaming] [crash] [GOKU] Wow! Are you okay, Bulma? Ugh. Does it look like I'm okay, you twerp? [whimpering] [GOKU] I guess not. Bulma, look, the Dragon Ball is glowing!  You know what this means, don't you? The fifth ball must be really close. This is great! Hey, look over there! Do you see what I see?

 [BULMA] A village! Good eye, kid. Do you think it's there? Well, there's only one way to find out. [engine whirring] [BULMA] I wonder where everybody is. [GOKU] Huh? [BULMA] Let's see what the radar says. Yep, the fifth Dragon Ball's here alright. Something's weird. [BULMA] It's too quiet. Maybe this village has been deserted. [GOKU] No, people are here. I can feel it. [BULMA] Are you sure, Goku? It seems like an old ghost town to me. Yeah, I'm positive. [BULMA] If you say so. [GOKU] Hello, in there! Come on out! [BULMA] Hello? Is anybody home? Hello? [GOKU] I think I just saw someone peeking at us from that window over there. [BULMA] This is getting freaky. There must be some reason why they won't come out here, and I'm gonna find out! [GOKU] Hello? I know you're in there. Hello? I hope they're not in some sort of trouble. [GOKU] Oh, yeah. That did the trick. Ever consider using the handle? [BULMA and GOKU] Hmm? [GOKU] Huh? Aah, oww! Ow, ow, ow, ow! [screams] Ahh. Oh, no. It's just as I feared... Oh, I should have known... [GIRL] Huh? [GOKU] What'd you do that for?! That didn't tickle, you know! Oh, please forgive me, Mister Oolong! I know it was foolish of me to try and attack you, but I'd rather die than lose my daughter! Oh, please don't take her! I'll do anything! --[GOKU] Huh? --[BULMA] Oolong? Hey, I think you've got me mixed up with someone. [GOKU] My name's Goku. [GIRL] It's not him, Dad. [crowd murmuring] [GIRL] Here we go, this'll help. [GOKU] Careful! Ow! What a thick head! Yeah, ha ha! He could've been killed! Shame on you! Hmph! I thought he was Oolong! [MAN] I was only trying to protect my daughter. [GOKU] Daughter? Does that mean that you're a girl? [giggles] [screaming] Yep! Thought so! You're a girl alright. [GOKU laughing] What'd you do that for?! Guess, Einstein! [GOKU] Hm? So what does this Oolong fellow do that makes everybody so afraid of him? [GIRL crying] He's our worst nightmare. He's a blackness that has descended on our village. A monster who treats us like his toys. That bad? [MAN] Much worse. How so? Well, somehow this terrible creature has the power to change into any shape it wants to. [growling] [screaming] [GOBLIN chuckles] Instead of one nightmare, we're cursed by many. No one knows his real identity, we just know [MAN] he wants our daughters. That monster's kidnapped three girls from the village already. [BULMA] Huh? [MAN] And yesterday my darkest fears came true. He wants my daughter, Pocowatha. Today's your lucky day, Sherman Priest! I've decided to honor your house by taking your daughter's hand in marriage tomorrow! [POCOWATHA crying] [GOBLIN] Pack your bag, Pocowatha! And don't worry about the dowry, Dad! [GOBLIN laughing] Bully! Maybe we can trap him when he comes back again. How will you do that? He's bigger than this house! My word. You don't get it, do you? Oolong would squish you like a little bug! There's no way to stop this monster! [whimpering] [SHERMAN] So tell us: why have you two come here anyway? I'll show you. [SHERMAN] Hmm? [BULMA] Let's see... there it is! We came to find a ball that matches this one. Hm. Strange. Yes, it's very beautiful. But I've never seen anything like it. --[OLD WOMAN] Well, I have. --[SHERMAN] Huh? Young lady, I have the matching one. I knew there was one here! What do you know? How 'bout that. [BULMA] Can I see it, please? [OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm. Here it is. Yeah! The six-star ball! [GOKU] Wow. --Cool! --Would you give it to us? I'm not going to give this ball away. It's been in my family for generations. [BULMA] Would you give us your Dragon Ball if we could get rid of that Oolong creep, get the girls back, and return your village to a peaceful place again? [SHERMAN] A-Ah, by yourselves? Now, listen, I may be old but I'm not gullible. How could the two of you defeat Oolong? Well, Goku and I are quite a team, ma'am. Right? Huh? [crowd murmuring] [BULMA yells] So you're a girl, aren't you? Huh?! What a randy boy! Are you crazy?! Please stop doing that! [BULMA] Ugh! [MAN] Do you think that you and that boy really have a chance to beat Oolong, Miss? [BULMA] Yeah, I think we have a good chance. Goku's a little on the puny side, but he packs a wallop. Don'tcha kid? [GOKU] Hmm. [BULMA] I'm Bulma. I'm the brains of the outfit. Would you forgive me for hitting you? We'd appreciate your help. [GOKU] Sure. There's a legend that speaks of a boy who would come to liberate our people, but we always thought it was just folklore. [OLD WOMAN] Mm-hmm. Bulma, it would be the answer to all my prayers if you brought my baby back! [MAN 2] You have my blessing young warrior. Your courage stands like a great monument before my people. [giggles] I just thought of a great way to trap Oolong. [BULMA] All right! You look great, kid! You'd be totally charming if you smiled a bit more. There's not much to smile about. Can we come up with a different plan, Bulma? Sorry, no time, kid! Gosh, Goku. You make a real pretty girl. [BULMA] Now remember Goku, don't blow your cover. He has to think you're Pocowatha. The important thing is to find out where he's keeping the girls. After that you can handle it any way you want to. All right, all right. I'll do it. But I'm not going to like this one little bit! [distant crash] Huh? [SHERMAN] It's Oolong! He's coming! [BULMA screaming] [OOLONG growling] [VILLAGERS screaming] [MAN] He's coming! Oolong's in the village and he's on his way here! [BULMA] Good job! Now try to make sure everyone gets into their houses safely! [MAN] I'll do it! Okay, it's up to you. Good luck. Well, since you're the brains of this outfit, you're going to help me, right? [BULMA] I'll be right here rooting for you, Goku. [GOKU] Mmm. [BULMA] Alright, kid, it's showtime. Don't let him get a good look at your face. And remember: smile. [GOKU] Next time, I'm making the plan. [OOLONG] I've come for you, my little buttercup! I brought you some flowers. I hope you like them, sweetheart. [GOKU] Oh, y-yeah, uh, I love flowers. [OOLONG] Huh? Packed your rolling pin? [whimpering] [OOLONG] And I see you've put on a little weight! [GOKU] Yeah, well, uh, l-look who's talking. You scamp! [OOLONG] A little feisty today, aren't we? Goku! Where did you learn how to act?! If you don't shape up, you're gonna blow this thing big-time! Mmm. That's good, I like 'em fiesty. I wouldn't change anything on you, except maybe that ugly scarf. [GOKU] Hm? Uh-oh... Oh my. You're trembling. [GOKU] That's because I need to use the bathroom real bad. You're scared! Well, I get my feelings hurt when girls are scared of me. [OOLONG] No more! That's it! [growls] [whimpering] [GOKU] Huh? What do you think of this? Suave, debonair, handsome. If you don't like it I can always change into something else. [GOKU chuckles] [BULMA] Aah! --[OOLONG] Hmm? --[GOKU] Huh? Well, hello there, stranger! My name's Bulma. I don't think we've met. [GOKU] Aah! My. Can such beauty be real? You must be a dream. Nope, I'm all... woman. [OOLONG] Imagine, if I had a woman like that... Oohhh... Yes. She's a delicious catch if I ever saw one. Oh, but what about Pocowatha? So, uh, when are you gonna kidnap me and take me away? [OOLONG] Ooh, I can't just leave Pocowatha, but I'd be crazy to refuse a girl like that. Pocowatha or the new girl? Pocowatha or the new girl? Pocowatha or the--huh? Where'd she go? [OOLONG] What?! Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing?! This must be some mistake! It can't be! Hmm? Uurgh! [screaming] I've been deceived! You're not Pocowatha! Huh? What gave me away? It was my tail, wasn't it? If there is one thing I cannot tolerate, it is deception! [grunts] [GOKU] Huh? [OOLONG laughing] [GOKU] Man, that's one big cow! I'm am not a cow, I am a bull! Can't you tell the difference?! And I'm a pretty mean one, too! Huh? Whoa! What happened to my polite, handsome, debonair man with the really expensive trench coat? Excuse me. This is just too weird! That monstrous beast has deceived you, too. He fools you by changing into the one thing that you want most. And in your case, that's a man. You should be ashamed of yourself! Uh... The good thing is I don't think he wants to marry Pocowatha any more, he wants to marry you instead. You'll make a nice bride, Bulma. What kind of a girl do you think I am?! I'm not getting married to a bull! And that's that! [OOLONG chuckles intensely] Goku, the plan's off, kiddo! It's time to take the bull by the horns! [GOKU yelling] Ha! Now we'll see just how tough you really are. Don't forget to find out where the girls are! And stay alive, okay?! Say your prayers, chico, your time has come! [OOLONG laughing] You've reached the end of the road there, muchacho! [laughing] Eh. Smile. Pfft. [OOLONG yells] What are you, loco, kid?! There's still a way you can save yourself! Get the seÃ±orita! Forget it, bully! Come on, let's go! [OOLONG] Alright, then! So be it! A little monkey-boy burrito might hit the spot anyway! Sounds yummy! Look, you can't scare me like you've scared everyone else. I'm not buying it! [OOLONG] Haven't you noticed?! You're a little cucaracha with a stick, and I am a gigantic bull! I don't care what you are, give those girls back now! [grunts] [clock chiming] Uh...I will be back! [GOKU] Huh? [GOKU] Hey! Come back here and fight! Where are you going?! [GOKU] Hey, come back! [GOKU] Huh? [whistling] Hey, excuse me. A giant bull just came barreling through here. Did you see where it went? There. [GOKU] Ha-ha! Hi. This is the bonafide one hundred percent original me. Believe it or not, a good-looking guy like myself has trouble scoring chicks. That's why I transform. [OOLONG] The art of transformation is a very powerful technique and should only be used responsibly to solve serious problems. In my case, I was being dogged by girls left and right, despite my natural cute and cuddly appearance. But now that I've gone to shape-shifting school, all that's changed. But the problem is I can only hold a shape for five minutes, and then, poof! That's why I had to run away from that kid. [SHERMAN] You say Oolong ran away? [BULMA] Yeah, I saw him take off, and Goku went after him. [SHERMAN] Hmm. Remarkable. What an extraordinary boy. Yeah. Goku will chase him a hundred miles if he has to. Wow. Maybe it's the legend after all. Hey, yo, Oolong. I know you're out there, you can't hide forever. Couldn't find him, huh? [GOKU] Uh-uh. [chuckles] [GOKU] Hey, everybody, he ran away! He might just be hiding though, so look out! [OOLONG] All right, here we go again. But I'd better watch it, or this kid could ruin a good thing. If I wanna keep these simpletons in line, I'd better come up with something really fierce. Wait, I know a good one... Yeah. [GOKU] Hmm. I guess he is gone. [yells] Uh...! [OOLONG] Looking for me, kid? [laughs] Did you really think I would run away?! [GOKU stammers] [OOLONG] You seem a little timid this time. Well you're lucky, tiny tot, because I'm feeling generous. I was going to dunk you in this hot soup and eat you like a dumpling, but if you leave town now, I will spare you. I think I'll stay. So go ahead and eat me... if you can! [OOLONG] If I can?! How dare you-- [crying] [OOLONG] Look what you made me do! [GOKU] What are you talking about? I didn't make you do anything! [OOLONG] Alright, that does it! Your luck's run out, little runt! I was going to let you go because you're not like all the other cowards, but now I have no choice but to destroy-- [wailing] [WOMAN] Johnny, do you wanna get yourself killed?! Ah! You know you've got a real little monster on your hands there, lady! [OOLONG] Kids these days... Now, where were we? [GOKU] You were just saying that you were going to destroy me. [OOLONG] Oh, yeah, yeah, right! Thanks, kid! You know what though? I don't think you're as strong as you say you are. [OOLONG] Rrrrgh! Listen here: I'm the fiercest, most impolite warrior on the face of the Earth! [GOKU] Yeah? I doubt it. [OOLONG] What makes you think that you're any match for me?! I learned karate from my Grandpa. [OOLONG] Karate, huh?! Well, if you're any good at karate, you could break these bricks with one hand! [GOKU] Oh yeah? Well, I can break them apart with one finger! Watch this! [OOLONG] Huh?! [GOKU laughing] [OOLONG] Do you know what I do to people who can do that?! [shrill laughter] [OOLONG] Nothing! Later, sucker! Hey, where're ya going?! Hey, don't just stand there! Go after him, kid! If he gets away, we'll never find out where the girls are! Oh, you're right. Hmm. Nimbus! Good luck! Amazing! It's our legend that an evil monster would be-- toppled over by a mere boy who could dance on the clouds. That kid was a royal pain in the kiester! Too bad he doesn't know how to fly! [chuckles] [GOKU] Hey, Oolong! [screams] Where do you think you're going?! [OOLONG] So long, sucker! [GOKU] Oh, no you don't! [panting] [GOKU] Here I come! [GOKU] I'm gaining on you, Oolong! [GOKU] I won't let you get away, you know. [OOLONG] Oh no! My five minutes... are up! [yells] [OOLONG yelling] [OOLONG] I'm not ready to die! That's because you haven't been being good. And who the heck are you? My psychiatrist?! Well, now, porky, what do you have to say for yourself? An apology would be nice. All right, then! I'm sorry. I can't believe I's scared of that pig... Now where's my grandaughter and the rest of the girls? They're... home. What home?! Look, pal. Your reign of terror is over, capiche?! Now tell us! Bulma, you're really brave now that Oolong's tied up. â™ª Doot doo-doo... â™ª â™ª Hey! If you're planning on turning into a bug, forget it! I'll squash ya! [OOLONG groans] Where exactly is this shack of yours? Is it far? Here's my little shack. [gong crash] Awesome! You don't see houses like that every day, do you? What a palace! [GOKU] How'd you get such a big place? Well, it wasn't easy, kiddo. I had to rip off a lot of people. And you're proud of that? [MAN] Little Flower, it's me! Your Poo-Paw is here! [MAN 2] Alexi! [WOMAN] Mother's here, Sarah! [MAN] You're safe now, sweetheart! Don't worry, girls! We're coming! [WOMAN] Huh?! Sarah! Is that you?! [MAN 2] Alexi! What are you doing?! Oh, hi, Daddy. What's happening? Sorry, I didn't write, Mommy. I've been super busy. Me, too. Man, time has just been flying by. [BULMA] Did you find them? --[GOKU] Huh? --[OOLONG] Hi, girls. [ALEXI] Oh, hi snookums! Oh, before I forget, I'm totally out of pink lipstick and red nail polish. [SARAH] And I need a new hair-dryer. [LITTLE FLOWER] Did you bring the diet drinks I asked you for? I was hoping these girls would cook and take care of my house, but they won't. All they wanna do is lay around. Take them off my hands. Pretty please? [gasping] Well, this belongs to you and Goku now. Wow, you made our day! [BULMA] Just two more to go and then I can call the Dragon to make my wish!
