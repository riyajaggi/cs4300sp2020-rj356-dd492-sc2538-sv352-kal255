 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, Goku and Krillin continued their training under the watchful eye of Master Roshi... [NARRATOR] A new day dawns on this tranquil island... A new day, full of new challenges... [NARRATOR] Now, before the morning dew has left the ground, Goku and Krillin resume their rigorous training schedule... With an added fifty pounds of turtle shell strapped to their backs! [NARRATOR] Each day, Master Roshi keeps the boys sweating by boosting their workload even more!

 The fields they run get longer... [NARRATOR] The mountains they climb get taller and taller... [NARRATOR] And yet, the two half-pint warriors endure... Because the World Martial Arts Tournament is fast approaching, and these boys are determined to fight...! At any cost! [GOKU] Krillin, I was wondering... [KRILLIN] Oh yeah? [GOKU] Yeah... [KRILLIN] What... about? [GOKU] Why... ...does that big mean dinosaur chase us everywhere we go? [NARRATOR] And so, months on the island passed with relative calmness...

 And the strength of the boys increased... [NARRATOR] Fortunately, so did their speed... [NARRATOR] Before long, it seems Goku and Krillin will complete their basic training and be ready to learn Master Roshi's martial arts! [KRILLIN] Almost... [GOKU] Yeah... Darn... That means I'll have to work! [GOKU and KRILLIN] More please! [LAUNCH] Uh, okay... [GOKU and KRILLIN] More please! [LAUNCH] Yes, of course! [GOKU and KRILLIN] More please! [LAUNCH] Oh my! You boys gobbled it all up! But don't you worry! [LAUNCH] There's more where that came from! Something wrong, Master? You stuck? I betcha' can't eat all this! [LAUNCH] Watch your fingers! [ROSHI] Here we go! [LAUNCH] Roshi?? [KRILLIN] Now he's really stuck! [GOKU] Wait don't move I need some rice! [NARRATOR] On and on the training days passed... until the Tournament was only one month away. [GOKU] Master Roshi!! Come on...! Hey...! It's an emergency! Uh...? What kind? No time to talk! Just come with me! Hey! Can't we take it easy?! [GOKU] This is it! Look! [ROSHI] Yeah, it's a rock... What's your point? You said if we moved it you'd teach us fighting! You remember? I... said that? See! I moved it too...! Almost as much as Goku did! There...! You get to teach us about fighting now! Oh... yes... How nice... [ROSHI] That rock thing was just a joke to keep them working... Guess I should have pointed to a mountain... [KRILLIN] Real Martial Arts! Finally! [ROSHI] Uh, Well boys... I have almost nothing left to teach you about... ...the Martial Arts. [GOKU] What?? [KRILLIN] Master?! The whole secret behind the Turtle Hermit fighting style is the training schedule... ...which you've done every day! You boys don't seem to realize but just by repeating these basic exercises over and over again, you've pushed your arms and legs and hearts and even your brains past their built-in limitations! That right there is the whole art behind Martial Arts! But how are we s'posed to win if we can't fight? Well... You boys didn't come here to win... you came to learn. But don't sweat it! You know how to fight! It's just the outer expression of your strength! It's natural! Uh, but aren't there special moves, or tricks to win? What, is there an echo in here Krillin? I just said winning wasn't the real point! This tournament is only another step in your training! It's an introduction! And that's the low-down. There's no point teaching you special moves until you get the fighting experience, so keep training the same. But... ...we're going to make it a little harder... Now you'll be wearing heavier turtle shells... They're twice the weight! [KRILLIN] So what do you think, Goku? You think there's even a chance we won't get creamed at the Tournament? Who knows? Maybe all we have to do is pretend our opponents are like another day of construction work. [wolf howls] [YAMCHA] Wolf Fang Fist! [wolf howls] [YAMCHA] It's been over a month now... ...and yeah I'm... strong... But it's too quiet... Perhaps I should return. [BULMA] I have just about had it! [PUAR] Oh Bulma, please don't say that! Why... not?! Because it's always been Yamcha's dream to fight in the Tournament... and it doesn't mean he stopped liking you! Four whole weeks and he doesn't even call!! He didn't send me a letter or flowers or even a stinking postcard!!! Face it baby... By now... he's forgotten your name... Well I would not be surprised! You saved me! Who are you?! Hm? Come on...! It's me...! Look! What...? Me who? Yamcha!! [PUAR] Yay!! Hello Puar! I missed you! How's it been here? Oh... Like a beach without sunshine! Oh fine! You ignored me all month long! Why wouldn't you ignore me now? Uh... I... [BULMA] Yamcha... I was worried about you! For all I knew you were dead in a ditch in a country you can't pronounce! You'll have to make this up to me... And you're going to enjoy it! [BULMA] Now let's go clean you up! [YAMCHA] O-kay... [NARRATOR] And so the last month counted down, until the Tournament was only one day away! Okay boys...! Did you remember to pack your toothbrushes? [KRILLIN] Yes sir! [GOKU] Tooth what? Okay... You can take off your shells now. Oh good...! I was scared we'd look silly at the Tournament! My body's so light now...! I feel like paper! [ROSHI] See how high you can jump. Hey Goku... Notice something different? [GOKU] Wow! Look how fast we can run!! [KRILLIN] We're unstoppable!! Hey boys, I've got something for you! [BOTH] Huh? Well... Since you're going to your first big tournament... [LAUNCH] I thought you should wear something nice! Launch did you make these yourself? I've never worn one of these before! Oh...! You look... adorable!! [KRILLIN chuckles] What's so funny? You in a suit. Hey... Let's get this baby moving or we're gonna miss our plane! Do your best! Thanks! See you soon! Hahaha! Enjoy yourself Launch...! And try not to sneeze! [LAUNCH] Bon Voyage, boys! Oh wow...! It's like a flying house...! What do they call this thing again? Airplane. [GOKU] How neat... Would anybody care for some coffee or orange juice? Can I help you sir? [mumbling] Eh... no... I'm fine... Oh, no...! Look Master...! There's stars on the ground! [ROSHI] Oh, don't worry! Those are city lights! We've arrived! Wow...! So they make stars in the city?! You think they'll give me one, Master? Caveman... It's so big...! Oooh...! And bright! Why don't we play the quiet game... You start. Hey, Taxi! Can you take us to the Colliseum? [TAXI DRIVER] Yeah, sure... [ROSHI] Thanks for the ride! [BULLHORN GUY] Anyone who hasn't registered please come to the front tables at once! You have until midnight! [GOKU] Gosh! The world's just full of people... isn't it? [ROSHI] This where we sign up? Yes... Just need your name. No... it's not me... It's those two. [RECEPTIONIST 1] Oh, you mean you want seats! No, no... They're entering the Tournament! Uh? You mean those kids there?! [ROSHI] Naturally! Do you see any others? [YAMCHA] Hey...! Hey Goku! [YAMCHA] Goku! Did you say my name? [YAMCHA] Hey Goku! How's it going? [GOKU] Who's... He? Ha...! Wolf Fang Fist! Yamcha!!! I thought you'd like that... Oh...! Wow...! I guess I didn't recognize you because your hair fell off your head! Bulma said long hair is out this year... Who's the tall guy? [GOKU] He's Yamcha...! He's friends with me! This guy's named Krillin and he's my new friend and training partner! Krillin... Hello! Well... It's done...! You're signed up! Huh? Goku?? Bulma...! Oolong...! Puar! And lookin' sharp! You think so?! So how've you guys been? Great! Goku...! How in the world did you wind up at the Tournament? [ROSHI] Hello! Oh gosh it's you...! Hey thanks for telling me that you were moving...! I stopped by the island to see how Goku was doing and your whole house was gone! Well... that pad is more for loving than training Martial Arts... Bulma... I keep thinking 'bout the last time I saw you... Remember? You wore that bunny suit... Remember...? Remember?! Why don't you put it on and we-- Shut up!!! Old Man... Filthy as dirt. Well Goku, I guess tonight we better hang out together while we still can! Because we're all gonna be rivals at the Tournament tomorrow! [GOKU] Hold on... I thought the Tournament started tonight! Afraid not, kid... Everyone gets checked in tonight but it all starts in the morning! Oh man... But I want to start! [NARRATOR] Happy as they were to be reunited with old friends, the time for catching up was short. Goku and the others needed to get plenty of rest for the big day, when the curtain for the World Martial Arts Tournament would at last be drawn. Oh, I hate crowds... Do you think they're all fighting? Well... Punch one and... see... Okay... Just stay close to me boys... Don't get lost staring... [BULLHORN GUY] Would all the athletes who are registered for the World Martial Arts Tournament please gather in the Contest Hall? Loud-mouth... Now are you absolutely sure you want to enter? Oh of course! We're gonna win it! We promise we'll be good! [ROSHI] This is as far as I can escort you... So do your best! [GOKU and KRILLIN] Right! Now one... More thing... You obviously can't fight in suits, so... Here! Wow...! This outfit's awesome! It's so bright...! I hope we don't stand out... Looks good Goku...! Yeah! The first roadblock will be the elimination round, and only eight top fighters from there will move to the actual Tournament, so take it seriously... I'll be watching from the crowd, so you won't see me, okay...? We'll work hard Master! Put your gut into it! Yeah... I've been training way too hard not to...! And I'll try not to get hurt! [GOKU] Wow... so all these people can fight? I'm starting... to feel a little queezy... Attention...! The World Martial Arts Tournament Elimination Round begins! [NARRATOR] Finally, months of intense preparation will be put to the test...! Will Goku and Krillin's training get them through the narrow elimination round...? And what about Yamcha...? You have to watch to find out! Next time, on Dragon Ball!
