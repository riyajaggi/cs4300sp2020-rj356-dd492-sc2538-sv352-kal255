 [GOKU] Boy, this place is really strange. [BULMA] Isn't there supposed to be a town around here somewhere, Oolong? I don't know. I've never been in this neck of the woods before! [beeping] Oh no! We're just about on empty, guys! [BULMA] Oh great! We should've filled up at that last town! [OOLONG] We were going to, but some 'dumb bunny' insisted we were almost there. Hey, don't blame me!

What a bunch of clowns, huh? They're gonna lead us right to that last Dragon Ball! Yeah!

 [BULMA] Keep your hands on the wheel! [OOLONG] Keep your hands on your mouth! [BULMA] You were picking your snout again! What a pretty voice. Did I say pretty voice? I, uh meant to say she has a pretty face. No, no, I mean, I said she has a pretty--No, I didn't mean to say pretty at all. I don't know what I meant. [PUAR] Here! I think you need to cool off, Yamcha. [gulping] That hit the spot! [OOLONG] Was not! [BULMA] I saw you! [OOLONG] Was not! See, I was right after all, Oolong! "See, I was right after all." [gasps] [GOKU] Hello there! [screaming] Golly! [OOLONG] That's the way it happens sometimes, kid. [BULMA] Maybe for you it does. [OOLONG] Who asked you? Hello, can I-- [OOLONG] Fill her up, please. [GOKU] Hey, Bulma! These people all seem scared of you for some reason. [BULMA] It's not every day they get to see a beautiful stranger. [BULMA] Ha, I'm going shopping! I wonder if they sell Dyno Caps in this town. [BULMA] Goku was right. [BULMA] These people here really are scared of me. Creepy! [BULMA] Ah-ha! Here we go! Dyno Caps! There you go, it's full to the brim! Can you wait just a minute? Our friend's gonna be right back with some cash. Oh no, no, no, that's okay! It is on my house! [giggling] [BULMA] You certainly have a wide selection here. Well, do you have any XB6's? Yes, and sevens. Alright then... I'll take two of those there... [BULMA] And three XB7's please. [SHOP KEEP] Yes, whatever you wish. Here you are, please take them! Well, I guess that's all I'll be needing today. So, how much? No! Nothing! Please, just take them! Oh? [screaming] Talk about a bargain! There are some expensive Dyno Caps, and I managed to get them all for free! You know, I sure am glad some people know how to treat a beautiful stranger like me! [YAMCHA] It sure is taking them a long time to get gas! [screaming] [brakes squealing] [RABBIT A] Bah! This town is so boring. [RABBIT B] Why don't we stir things up around here? [RABBIT A] Sounds good to me. [BULMA They're not really my style, but they're comfortable. I guess they'll have to do. Anything's better than that dumb bunny outfit I was wearing. Whoa, I almost forgot about these. [BULMA] Here! That's a good look for you. What? You mean you're not a member of the Rabbits, young lady? The Rabbits? What's that? [MAN] Get out of here! --Man! --And stay out! How dare you play such a dirty trick?! Now, for some reason, nobody's even looking at me. And they're definitely don't look scared anymore. Hey, Puar, here comes that girl. Hey guys! I got some really great stuff here. [GOKU] I hope you got some food in there. I'm starving! [OOLONG] Food? Are you kiddin'? Those bags are full of make-up and clothes, buddy. [RABBIT A] Yuck! These apples are rotten! Hey! We've been ripped off! You heard him! We want our money back! But you got them free! [RABBIT A] You don't hear so good! He said we want our money back! [MAN] Here, here! Please, forgive! [BOY] Mama! [RABBIT B] Hey! Don't you know that no one's supposed to cross the path of a Rabbit?! Yes! I'm sorry, but he's just a boy, he doesn't know any better! [RABBIT B] Here's a lesson he'll remember! Holy cow! These goons are serious! So they're the Rabbits! Look, buddy. There's a new chick in town! [RABBIT A] How do you like them apples? [RABBIT B] My, my, my. Hey there, pretty lady, how'd you like to spend some time with a couple of real men? Yes, maybe? Why? Have you seen any? You must be new in town if you're dumb enough to talk to the Rabbits like that! [RABBIT B] Maybe we should teach her some manners? [BULMA] If anyone has anything to learn, it's you two Cro-Magnon morons! [BULLMA] Grown men in rabbit ears! Ha! Can you believe these two idiots? [BULMA] Come on, you guys. We're leaving. [RABBIT B] Hold it. What's the big hurry, toots? The party's just starting! [RABBIT B] Yes, maybe. Goku, these bad men need to be taken care of or they might hurt us. Oh, okay. Wait! Goku's no match for a pistol! Yeah! He's gonna "take care" of us. Frightening, isn't he? Little pipsqueak. [RABBIT B] Oh my, I hope he doesn't hurt us too bad! [RABBIT A] Yeah! [RABBIT B] What the--? [shots firing] [blows landing] [BULMA] One down and one to go! Hey, kid! [screaming] I don't think those guys are gonna hurt anyone now, Bulma. You're right! Thanks to you! [OOLONG] Hmph! I coulda done that. Ha! Those guys didn't know what they were getting themselves into. Now you've done it! You've insulted the Rabbits, and you're gonna pay big time for this, kid! No, he didn't insult the Rabbits. He just beat them up! Boss, this is Rabbit One! Come to town, pronto! [gasping] We got ourselves a troublemaker down here. [screaming] A curse on you! Thanks to you, the boss is coming! [doors slamming] [GOKU] Whoa? [OOLONG] I got a nose for trouble, guys, and this place stinks! I tell ya something bad is gonna happen! I knew we never should have stopped here. I wanted to keep going! [BULMA] Oolong, you did not! We came here for gas, remember?! [OOLONG] Fine, we got our gas, let's go! Well, nothing's happening. [OOLONG] Listen, I say we get out of here before something does happen. Well, I'm not going to let a couple of goons wearing rabbit ears scare me away! [groaning] Hey, get up! You're okay. [RABBIT B] Oh, but it hurts... [RABBIT A] Don't worry. The boss is coming, and he'll do his special thing to those intruders! "Special thing"? Hey, what's this "special thing"? [RABBIT A] Just a little trick our boss does to entertain. So stick around and enjoy the show. [RABBIT B] Don't worry, he's not going to turn you into a carrot, or anything! I don't like carrots. Hey! Let's get out of here, Goku! I wanna stay and see what everyone around here is so scared of. Yeah, me too. [horn honking] [RABBIT A] Here comes the boss! Hey, boss over here! [RABBIT B] Are my ears on straight? Yes, yes, maybe. [OOLONG] Whoa! Looks like the circus has come to town! [RABBIT A and RABBIT B] Oh, Boss, help us! Knock it off, you mugs! Just point me out the sap that thinks he's tough enough to take on the mighty Rabbits! [RABBIT A and RABBIT B] That's him, over there! [BULMA] You mean that old furball is their leader? [OOLONG] Yeah, look at him! He looks like a reject from an Easter parade! [RABBIT A] We heard that, pig! [OOLONG] Oh yeah? What are you gonna do? Wiggle your nose and tickle me?! [RABBIT B] Awfully big words for a bacon bit! [RABBIT A] Good one! I know I've seen that rabbit before... [BOSS RABBIT] You call yourself "Rabbits" and you got beaten up by a kid? [RABBIT A and RABBIT B] Uh, sorry Boss... [BOSS RABBIT] Quit groveling! Watch this! [howling] [BOSS RABBIT] Let's shake hands, baby! I wouldn't trust him, Bulma. Hey, did you want to be friends with us? [BOSS RABBIT] Certainly! Now I remember! His touch is his weapon! If they shake his hand they're goners for sure! There! Now make like a nice bunny and hop out of here, would ya? You touched me! [GOKU] You turned Bulma into a carrot! [BOSS RABBIT] Want a bite, maybe? [RABBIT A] Serves you right for messin' with da boss! His name is Monster Carrot, and his touch is lethal! [GOKU] You bully! Change her back! Sure, kid, if you want to end up like your friend. Why don't you come and get me? [MONSTER CARROT] But you gotta like vegetables, 'cause if you touch me, you're gonna be one! Come on, Goku, use your Power Pole! That way you won't have to touch him! Yeah, that's right! Ha! [MONSTER CARROT] Stop! Don't forget about your friend here! [laughing] Kid! You take one more step and I'll have this delicious carrot for my lunch! [laughing] Alright, you win! I give up! Oolong! What do you think I should do now? [OOLONG] Run for it! [RABBIT A] Man, that pig is flying! Oolong, you're not a pig! You're a big chicken! Tough break! You're on your own, kid! It's just you and the Rabbits now! Boys! Go get 'em! [RABBIT A and RABBIT B] Sure thing, Boss! Yes! I'm gonna pound him flat like a postage stamp! [blows landing] Puar! Come on! That kid needs our help! It's up to us to get him out of this mess! Otherwise we'll never see those Dragon Balls! [YAMCHA] Change into a bird and snatch that carrot! [PUAR] Right! Come on, pick it up a little, boys. I don't have all day, you know. [blows landing] [screaming] We've got the carrot, Goku! Now you can finish him off with your Power Pole! Hey! You're helping us! That's real nice of you! Never mind that! Get Monster Carrot! Right. [MONSTER CARROT] Come back here, thief! I! Want! My! Carrot! [MONSTER CARROT] Gotcha! Uh-oh! [YAMCHA] Yeah, here she comes! [MONSTER CARROT] Ah, I want that carrot, you dumb bird! Gimme, gimme, gimme! Good work, Puar, now bring that carrot over here! And hurry! [MONSTER CARROT] Touch me! [GOKU and YAMCHA] Ow... [screaming] Hey! If we smash into him, we'll touch and turn into carrots! Are you looking for this, Mister Rabbit? [MONSTER CARROT] Stop! What about your little friend?! That's right. You don't want anything to happen to her, do ya? [screaming] [MASTER CARROT] Whoa! Who are you? Where did you come from? [PUAR] Touch me! All I want is a little touch. Just one, little touch! No! Stay back! Stay back! Goku, time to use your Power Pole! [GOKU] Power Pole! Extend! [screaming] Hey! You better change her back! Or else I'm gonna whack you again! Whack me again? Yeah, whack you again. Okay, I guess you win! Bulma! Oh man, I feel like a vegetable. You were until Yamcha and Puar helped us! Yamcha! Where is he? I guess he took off already. She likes you. You know, it was a lot easier for me to be around her when she was just produce! [RABBIT A] Try not to touch us, boss! So, Oolong! Where were you, huh? Some friend you are, running away like that! I, uh, made sure no one took the car! Yeah right! You might as well have coward stamped on that big forehead of yours! Boy, you were a lot nicer when you were a carrot, ya know. [BULMA] I heard that! [shouting] That should do it! Now to finish the job with my Power Pole! He's gonna whack us! [GOKU] Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you. Power Pole, extend! How can we ever repay you? Hey, don't sweat it! This one's on my house! [BULMA] So, what did you do with the Rabbit gang? I took 'em to the moon! [GOKU] I told them that if they made enough rabbit treats for all the kids on Earth, I might let them come back down. It should keep them busy for awhile. [BULMA] Rabbit treats? [GOKU] What, don't you like marshmallows?
