 If you don't wanna gross people out, you're gonna have to stop eating frogs and snakes and things. [GOKU] Really? [BULMA] Mm-hm. How about lizards? [BULMA] Nope, eating lizards is nasty too, kid. You're just going to have to toughen up. [GOKU] Yeah! This looks like a good place to camp! [BULMA] There's no need to live outside like savages. I have my Dyno-caps, remember? [GOKU] Huh? Don't tell me you have a tent in one of those things, Bulma? Well, no, not exactly.

 [GOKU] I don't like those magic witch-bombs. Grandpa said never to use magic unless it's to help someone. [BULMA] Oh, well I am going to help someone, silly. She's pretty and has blue hair. [BULMA] What's the matter? You're not afraid, are you? [BULMA] Here it goes! [GOKU] Huh? [BULMA] There we go! Now doesn't that look cozy? Come on, Goku. What are you waiting for? [GOKU] Uhhh... [GOKU] Get away from its mouth, Bulma! I'll protect you from this monster! [BULMA] Thanks, that's noble of you, but it's just a house. See? [GOKU] Bulma! You made it light, but it's still dark outside! [BULMA] Chill out. It's a little something we call "electricity". Were you transported from the stone age or what? [GOKU] Huh? Oh, wow! This is amazing! [guitar playing] Goku... Oh, no, that guy's trapped and he's trying to break the glass by playing that horrible music! [MAN] Lilah, I love you. [LILAH] Kiss me, you fool. [LILAH] Oh, Chad! I've waited so long for this! [CHAD] I'll love you forever, my darling! [GOKU] What's this thing? [BULMA] One little kiss... One kiss... [BULMA] Yes! Almost there! [monster screeching] [BULMA screaming] [GOKU laughing] [BULMA] You shut up! [GOKU] Hey, are you getting hungry, Bulma? [BULMA] Huh? [GOKU] Well, you're drooling. [BULMA] Now I'm embarrassed! Hey, what's that horrible smell? Ugh, Goku, you need a bath! [GOKU] Uhhh... what's a bath? [BULMA] Oh, kid! I can't believe you're asking! I guess I gotta show you... [BULMA] We civilized people call that a "towel"! Now let's get this over with! Hop in! [GOKU] Hmm... So this is a bath? [BULMA] Look at you! You're supposed to cover up the front! [GOKU] Hm? Like this? [GOKU] Why are you putting this fluffy stuff in my hair? [BULMA] It's called shampoo. And I'm putting it in your hair to clean it. I don't do this very often, you know. You should consider yourself lucky! [BULMA] No wonder your hair stands up, it's never been washed. There, that's better. Yeah! What in the world?! Whoa! How does this thing stay on, kid? I thought it was attached to your pants! What do you do, super-glue it to your butt? [GOKU] Ow! What are you doing?! That hurts! [BULMA] I'm trying to take this thing off so I can wash your back properly. [GOKU] Here, that's okay. I can wash my own back. Huh? [GOKU] See? It's easy! [whimpering] [BULMA screaming] No way! It moves! [BULMA] That means it's... it's real! Goku, uh, why do you have a tail growing? Well, I don't really know why. I just know that all boys have 'em. It's no big deal, it's just the way we are. Huh? [BULMA] Maybe he's right. I've never actually seen a boy take a bath before so I guess I can't be sure. Maybe they just keep them tucked in their pants or something. How bizarre! I can't believe I'm a teenager and I'm just now finding out. Well, I guess I shoudn't say all boys, because my Grandpa didn't have a tail. See? See? Normal men don't have tails or your grandpa would've had one! But my Grandpa was a very odd fellow, you know! You're the real odd ball! So that was a bath, huh? A bath sounds so wonderful. [BULMA] Aah, there's nothing like a long hot bath to melt a woman's cares away, that's for sure! [BULMA] Mmm! Hm? [screaming] What are you doing?! Can't you see that I'm taking a bath, kid?! Yeah. I was going to help you scrub your back. You know, since you don't have a tail. No way, I can scrub my own back! Now beat it! Shoo, shoo! Gosh, I don't get it, Bulma. You were going to help me scrub my back. [BULMA] Goku, you're a little kid and I'm practically a full-grown woman! There's a big difference! There is? [BULMA] Yes, there certainly is! But we're not going to get into that right now... Hey, you don't have to be ashamed, no way. What in the world are you talking about? I happen to be one of the most beautiful girls that you'll ever see! So what do I have to be ashamed of, buster? [GOKU] Not having a tail? That's it, get out of my face. But I want to help. Beat it! Oh, come on. [BULMA] I can't take it anymore! Get out of my bathroom and stay out! And for the last time, I don't want a stupid tail! Uhhh! It's about time I got a little bit of privacy. [GOKU] Bulma. I'm hungry. [BULMA] Goku! [PILAF] Well, did you bring me a Dragon Ball, Shu? [SHU] No, sire. I-I got real hungry so I came back. [PILAF] Imbecile! You won't get so much as a bone until you bring me another Dragon Ball! [SHU] But, sire! I'm so hungry that I can't even think! [PILAF] That's a good thing, Shu. You'll have to trust me on that. [burps] [PILAF] Ahh, look how it sparkles so brilliantly! And yet it's only one piece to the puzzle! I have to have those other six Dragon Balls! [SHU] But why, sire? Isn't one enough? Of course one isn't enough! If I pulled out all of your teeth except one, would that one be enough to chew with?! No! [PILAF] If I cut off all of your paws except one, would that one be enough to run with?! No! Do you see my point now, Shu? I can't rule the world with one ball! Can you understand that?! Yes, I think so! But isn't the world an awfully big place? How can one person rule the whole thing? Well, you have to be able to delegate, Shu, and I've always been good at telling other people what to do. Bossing people around is one of my strong points. Right! That's true, sire! [PILAF] There are other requirements, Shu! You have to be able to think big! Not small, big! And though small in stature, I think very big! I have all the qualities needed to rule the world! What I don't have are those other six Dragon Balls! You dolt! [PILAF wailing] [PILAF farts] [SHU] Uh, oh! [chuckles] Heh, heh! Did you hear that? Huh?! I think you did... No, Sire! It wasn't me! I swear! [PILAF] We'll see about that! [SHU] Huh? [PILAF] Ha-Ha! Ha ha ha! Note to me: I must remember to move that button to a closer spot! Please let me go, sire! I didn't do anything! Are you saying that I would be capable of such a gross emission? [SHU] Oh, no! Please, sire! I'll not tolerate this kind of outburst from one of my agents! I'm afraid the time has come to trim the staff a bit! Don't chop me up! I admit it, sire! I did it! I tooted, I farted, I passed gas! Guilty as charged, woo-hoo! Let out a stinker! That's better. I'll let this one go because you were honest. Just make sure it doesn't happen again! Is that clear, Shu?! [SHU] Yes, sire! I'll try to contain myself! [WOMAN] Emperor Pilaf! That sounded like Agent Mai. Sire, Agent Mai reporting as ordered. [PILAF] Hmm, well, what's the news? Did you bring me back another Dragon Ball? [MAI] No, Sire, But I do have some valuable information. Is it about the Dragon Balls? Well?! Yes. [MAI] A deep-cover agent of ours landed in a place known as Skull Valley. Just before he left his spy-plane, he reported seeing a mysterious light with a bright glow. [PILAF] Was the light a Dragon Ball? [MAI] We don't know, sire. He disappeared! We never heard from him again! Hmm, take Shu with you and see if there's a Dragon Ball over there. Sire! I have obedience school today! Nevermind that! We need a disposable agent like you on this mission, Shu! Now go get me a Dragon Ball! --Yes, sir! --Yes, sire... So this is it, huh? Eww, yuck! This bread stuff doesn't have any flavor! And my soup's bitter too! [BULMA] That's not soup, it's coffee! And how do you expect to grow big and strong if you don't eat right! You know you're right! Thanks for the advice, Bulma! Huh?! Where do you think you're going? [GOKU] I'm going to go get some food that will make me big and strong! I'll bring some back! [BULMA] You might wind up being food yourself if you're not careful out there! I wouldn't do it! [wolf howling] Wow. Slim pickings so far. Bulma can probably eat this whole centipede by herself! I'm going to have to do better than that. [GOKU] Hm? A bird! Wow! [MAI] There's Skull Valley. It's right below us. Can we go back now and just say that we went? [MAI] Nah, we better check it out. [SHU] Geronimo! [MAI] Shu! Be quiet. [SHU] Sorry. [MAI] Come on. [MAI squealing] [SHU] I want to chew on one of these bones, but I'm too scared! [MAI] Let's just make sure we leave with our own bones. [SHU] Yeah. [MAI and SHU] Huh?! What is that?! I don't know. It could be a Dragon Ball. Let's check it out. [SHU whimpering] [MAI and SHU] Huh? The kid likes to jump! He's a hopper alright! Beat it, kid, before you get hurt! You beat it! Look, I'm not going anywhere! That's my big birdy! I saw it first, so you two just stay away! What in the world is he talking about? Beats me. Kid, I think I hear your mommy calling. [MAI and SHU] Huh?! [SHU] Those lights weren't Dragon Balls! [MAI] No kidding! [GOKU] This is great! Now there's enough for all of us! Ahh! Alright! Yum! [wolves snarling] [screaming] [blows landing] [GOKU laughing] [blows landing] [screaming] [SHU] This is it, Mai! [blows landing] That was close! [GOKU] Hm?! Hey, my bird! It's getting away! Power Pole, extend! Dog-gone it. This bird's rock hard. [whimpering] [GOKU] Bulma, I'm back! [BULMA] Huh, he's alive after all. Well, I'll be darned. Hm? If you think this appetizer looks good, take a look at the main course! [whimpering] [screaming] [GOKU] Huh? Bulma? Bulma, are you serious about not eating? This is looking pretty good! [BULMA] You're grossing me out, Goku! I can't believe you're gonna eat that! [chomping] [GOKU burping] [BULMA] Oh, my gosh! That is so disgusting! You need to brush your teeth, kid! [GOKU] Huh? [BULMA] I don't want to smell your nasty ol' wolf-breath! Wow! What a soft bed! I could bounce like this all night! Come on, Bulma, there's room for both of us! Room? What are you talking about, kid? We're not sleeping together. You're sleeping on the floor. Are you serious? [BULMA] Yes! You're used to roughing it, aren't you? A guy who eats centipedes shouldn't mind sleeping on the floor. I don't mind, but I hope it's not because you're still mad about not having a tail. Get it through your thick head: I don't want a tail! [BULMA] There we go. [BULMA] Hey...Goku... why did you live with your grandpa anyway? I mean, what happened to your parents? I'm not sure what happened. My Grandpa found me on a mountainside on a little bed of moss when I was just a baby so he picked me up and took me home. [BULMA] Did you know that you don't have to keep a tail just because you're born with one? Some dogs actually get their tails cut off while they're still small. You shouldn't have let them do that to you, Bulma. You're no dog. I'm not talking about me, lame-brain! I never had a tail! Hm?! [GOKU snoring] I don't know what planet this kid's from, but it's not Earth! [wolves howling] [birds chirping] I'm up... [yawning] [GOKU] I guess it's not time to get up yet... Ha! See! I told her there was enough room for both of us! [smacking] [GOKU] Hm? Strange...It feels like there's nothing ther-- [GOKU screaming] Huh?! Wha--Wha--?! I-It's your balls, Bulma! They're gone! What?! You're kidding me?! How?! --[GOKU] U-uh, I don't know! --[BULMA] Please, no! Thank goodness! They're all here, Goku. You must have been dreaming. Man, you really had me scared. [moaning] My gosh, Bulma. Wow, how long is this going to take? Look, nobody asked for your commentary! Besides, you didn't have to wake us up at this insane hour! Early birds! You can have your nasty, old worm. [GOKU] Well, you're moving so slow I wouldn't be surprised if you turned into a turtle. [BULMA] Goku, you can go out in public with your hair sticking out in every direction if you want to, but not me. Would you like to have coffee with me? Nah, it doesn't taste good and it makes me feel funny! [GOKU] I'm gonna go exercise! [GOKU] Mm! [growling] [grunting] [crashing] [GOKU] Hmm! [growling] [grunting] Whoa! [GOKU] What in the world?! Ow, that's a new pain... Bulma, wow! You really did turn into a turtle! Boy, I guess this kinda changes our plans a bit, huh? [TORTOISE] Hmm? [BULMA] Goku? Who were you talking to out there, kiddo? What?! [BULMA] Hm? Who are you? [GOKU] I thought he was you! [BULMA] Wha-? Strange... A tortoise shouldn't be living around here! Aren't you supposed to be living by the sea? Yeah. And I'm very concerned about being so far from home. By the way, do you have any salt water? Sure, we'll fix you right up. [slurping] [burps] Good seawater. Aromatic, yet full bodied. [BULMA] Yeah, I think it's an eighty-seven. Nope, eighty-six! [BULMA] Really? Are you sure about that? Mm-hm. I know my water. So, what are you doing here? Well to make a long story incredibly short: I'm lost! It's that simple. I'm lost! I've been trying to find my way back to the sea for over a year now. That's so sad! And you're still not anywhere near the sea. Hold on, let me go check my map. Wait here a second. Bad news: you're still a hundred miles away! Great, that'll take me twenty years! Gosh! That sounds like a long time. Hmm, I wish there was a way that we could help you. Yeah. Hey, I know! Would you like me to carry you to the sea, Mister Turtle? [TORTOISE] Why, yes! Thank you! Are you nuts?! But you just said that you wished we could help! So why don't we just take him to the sea? I didn't mean that for real, Goku. We're on an adventure. We don't have time to transport a beached turtle, okay? You're impossible! [BULMA] I'm impossible?! What do you mean by that?! [GOKU] Well, if we're so pressed for time, why did you just spend the whole morning in front of the mirror worrying about your hair?! Fine, help the stupid turtle if you want! I can find the Dragon Balls by myself! Hmph! Gosh, are women like this where you come from? No, most have tails. [BULMA] Sure, be that way! I hope you get a backache, you little twerp! Hmph! Man! What a geek! I don't need his stupid help, anyway! I can handle whatever comes my way on my own! [roaring] Hm?! [BULMA] Stop! Stop, or I'll run you down! I mean it, Goku! [TORTOISE] Oh, we better stop. That girl scares me. Careful! You could mess up your hair riding on that thing! [BULMA] Knock it off. I decided to forgive you. [GOKU] Huh? What's the matter? Scared? [BULMA] Me? Scared? Give me a break! Let's just go find those Dragon Balls. [NARRATOR] Join us again next time for another exciting episode of Dragon Ball!
