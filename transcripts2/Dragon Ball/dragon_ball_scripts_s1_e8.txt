 Dragon Ball (1995–2003): Season 1, Episode 8 - The Kamehameha Wave - full transcript 
 Once they land on Roshi's island, Goku and Chi-Chi explain to him their dilemma--Chi-Chi and the Ox King can't get into their castle until the flames on Fire Mountain are extinguished. Roshi agrees to give them the Bansho fan if Goku can convince Bulma to get him a date with an older woman. Unfortunately he realizes that he used the fan as a place mat, then threw it away when it became sticky. He then accompanies them to Fire Mountain to extinguish the flame himself with his Kamehameha Wave. He succeeds, but he accidentally destroys the castle and the mountain too. Afterward, he agrees to train Goku. Bulma finds the 6th dragon ball, and the group sets out to find the 7th and final one.

 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, Goku and Chi-Chi searched for the island home of Master Roshi, who possesses a magic fan capable of putting out the flames of Fire Mountain. [GOKU] I see it down there, ChiChi! [GOKU] Hold on. [GOKU] Hello!! [ROSHI] Hmm?  Hi! What the... Well, I'll be darned! It's my young friend with the Flying Nimbus! [GOKU laughing]

 [GOKU] Here we come! You're clear for landing! That old guy is Master Roshi? [ROSHI laughing] [ROSHI] I had a feeling I'd see you again. I still have the Flying Nimbus! It's great! [ROSHI] Still have it? [GOKU] Uh-huh. [ROSHI] I'm not surprised. Why, if I didn't know better, I'd say that cloud was made for you! Yeah, we get along great! We're friends now! Hey Goku? What happened to your friend here? Last time I saw her she was taller, and, uh, prettier, and,

 well, you know, she bigger too... heh... Now she's, uh, not! Oh, yeah. Well, that was Bulma, but this girl's ChiChi. [GOKU] Her dad's the Ox-King! [CHICHI] Mm-hmm! [ROSHI] Really? [GOKU] He's the one who asked us to come here. [CHICHI] Mm-hmm. [ROSHI] Hmm. Well, the Ox-King, huh? [ROSHI] Why, I haven't heard from him in years. [ROSHI] You know, I used to train that little guy! --[ROSHI rambling] --Psst! Hey, Goku! Are you sure this guy's Roshi? That's him! Well, we'll just see about that! Before I believe that he's a Martial Arts Master. He's gonna have to prove it! Huh? [ROSHI rambling] If he can avoid it, then he's Roshi! [crack] [whimpering] [screaming] Boy, that's gotta hurt. The real Master Roshi would have dodged it! Why you--Nobody could have ducked that in time! Not even me! That's 'cause you're not Master Roshi! Now tell us who you really are! [ROSHI] Look! It's me! I am Roshi! [CHICHI] Oh no! Papa's going to kill me! I'm sorry. Here, I'll get it. Crazy kids! The Bansho Fan? Yes, I have that. It's a magic fan. Wave it once and it causes a heavy wind. The second time it's waved a rain cloud appears. And the third time? It rains. A lot. Perfect! [ROSHI] Now hold on! The fan is very dangerous. [ROSHI] I'm not sure you kids could handle it. But we have to put out the flames on Fire Mountain! [CHICHI] They're so hot that me and my Papa can't get back into our castle. Please help us, Master Roshi. Well, the Bansho Fan definitely could put out that fire. And since one good turn deserves another... [ROSHI] Hmm...  [ROSHI] Now, let's get this straight. I'm going to help you with the Bansho Fan, but I'm going to need you to help me with something, all right? [ROSHI] Remember that other girl you were with? You mean Bulma? Yeah! I was hoping you could convince her to pay an old man a visit. Perhaps take a romantic moonlight stroll around the island? But Master! You know that dating is against your code! Shhh! Shhh! And it's not a date, it's a walk. Do-gooder... Oh, hopeless... Who asked you, you goodie-goodie?! Besides, can't a fragile old man near the end of his end have a little fun before he goes? But Master, you drank from the Fountain of Youth, so you know you're not anywhere near your end! Why you rotten, little traitor! A walk's no big deal. I'm sure Bulma won't mind. There, heh, you see? [ROSHI] Now listen, kid. Don't say anything to ChiChi, 'cause I don't want her dad to know. Right. It's a secret! [GOKU] Hey ChiChi, we get to borrow the Bansho Fan! [CHICHI] Yaay! [ROSHI] Hey, Turtle? [ROSHI] Do you remember what I did with that blasted fan? [ROSHI] I can't find it anymore! You were using it as a place mat the last time I saw it. A place mat?! Dear me! That was the Bansho Fan? Oh, I spilt some juice on it, so I threw it away 'cause it was all sticky. [GOKU] No... Here come the tears. [wailing] We can't put out the fire! [GOKU] No Dragon Ball, either. [ROSHI] Enough! It looks like I'll just have to go to Fire Mountain and put out those flames myself. You mean, you can really do that? Well, of course! There's nothing Master Roshi can't do. [ROSHI] All right. Let's go. [GOKU] Why'd you change your clothes? Gotta look sharp. There's no telling what the day might bring! Wait a second. You can't ride the Flying Nimbus, can you? Don't worry about that, son. I think I can find another ride. [ROSHI] Come to me, Baby Gamela! At your service. I need to take an express spin over to Fire Mountain. Sure! Okay, behave yourself. Hey, I don't find that the least bit funny. Now don't forget: promise me we'll have our little talk with Bulma as soon as we get there. Okay, I promise. [GOKU] We'll go on ahead and meet you there. Okay? [ROSHI] Okay, kids! I'll be along shortly! [grunting] [CHICHI] Do you think he can really put out Fire Mountain, Goku? [GOKU] I'll bet he can. He said he could do anything. [ROSHI] ♪ Buffalo gals won't ya come out tonight, ♪ ♪ come out tonight... ♪ I'm getting' dizzy... What?! The Bansho Fan is ruined?! [GOKU] Yes, but it's okay! He told us he could put the fire out himself! That's funny, kid. You actually fell for that? I don't believe it. [GOKU] There he is now!! [gasping] [ROSHI yelling] Oh, Master Roshi! It's really you! Ahh. Master? Are you... Are you okay? [CHICHI] I'm sorry, Papa. He wasn't like this when we found him. [ROSHI] That's the one drawback to riding Gamela. He makes you so darn dizzy it's hard to adjust. Are you going to put out the fire now? Wait! First thing's first! [ROSHI] I've heard about you, you big, old ox, hurting people over a silly treasure! Is that how you show respect to the master who taught you?! [OX KING] I'm so sorry, Master! Please forgive me! I guess I'm not worthy. And here I thought I'd seen it all. [OX KING] I beg of you, please forgive me Master! [ROSHI] Oh, stop your blubbering, you big oaf! I forgive you. [ROSHI] Now, you mean to tell me that you can't put out that fire yourself? What's wrong, too old? [OX-KING] Oh, ha ha. Yes, Master Roshi. Psst! Hey, kid. The promise. Oh. [BULMA] Okay, okay. Now what's all this hush-hush about? [ROSHI] Well, uh. I-I can, uh, explain. [GOKU] He wants to go on a walk with you. [BULMA] What? [ROSHI] Well, a moonlight stroll, really. [BULMA] You mean like a date?! [ROSHI] Well, something like that. Now listen! I don't where you got the idea that I'd wanna go on a date with you, but I don't! [ROSHI] I must confess, our young friend here had something to do with it. [ROSHI] He said you'd walk around my island with me if I put out the fire. What's the big deal? It's just a little walk. You be quiet! [ROSHI] 'Course, I s'pose I could just go home... Fine. A walk. But, that's as far as it goes, mister! And don't get the wrong idea! I'm only agreeing because I need those flames put out! If you do that, I'll go on a walk with you. A short one. [ROSHI] You got it! It's a deal! Now promise! [ROSHI] Earth, water, sea air, I declare a pinky swear! How do I get myself into these things? [CHICHI] Hey, here they come! [OOLONG] It's about time! [ROSHI] It's time to cool this mountain down! Sounds like he's ready for action, doesn't it? Yeah! I gotta see this! [BULMA] I almost hope he can't pull this thing off! [clattering] Well, here goes! [groaning] Get ready for that walk! Yeah, yeah. [ROSHI] Hey kid, could you give me a boost? [OOLONG] Oh boy! So he can really do this, huh? Don't underestimate the Master! Okay. Ready. [grunting] [whimpering] [squealing] Now watch this! It's the Master's Kamehameha Wave! [grunting] What's he doing?! Oh, I think we should get out of here! [YAMCHA] Wait. I've heard of this technique. Right now he's gathering all of the latent energy in his body. Then he's going to release it all at once! But I've... I've never seen it in action before! Ka... me... ha... me.... haa! [explosion] Oh, I'm pooped. Wowee. M-M-Master, look the fire, it's out. But you kinda... Spit it out! Well, the mountain, and my castle... [ROSHI] Hey, not bad for an old man. [ROSHI] I'm not as rusty as I thought... [BULMA, CHICHI, GOKU, OOLONG] But...it's gone! Whoops. Sorry about that. [OOLONG] Just look at this rubble heap! How on Earth are we going to find that Dragon Ball? [BULMA] Don't worry. My trusty radar will find it for us. I'll just adjust the scale here. and voila! [BULMA] See, I've already got a reading. It should be fifty yards in that direction over there. [OX-KING] Thank you so much for putting the fire out, Master. It feels better here already. [ROSHI] Oh, don't thank me. I feel bad about wrecking your castle. [CHICHI] Don't feel bad, we can always build ourselves a new one. [YAMCHA] So that little, old man really is the great Master Roshi! Extraordinary! That was incredible! Can you teach me how to do that? Sure, but it'll probably take you 50 years to learn the Kamehameha Wave. Aww, Fifty years. [OOLONG] Are we there yet? [BULMA] Almost. We're really close now. [OX-KING] Master, won't you stay here and live with us? Thanks, but I really do enjoy living by myself. Ka... me...ha...me... ha! Aww, but it wasn't even close to what the Turtle Hermit did. Excellent! Well, that's Gohan's grandson! What? Goku is Gohan's grandson?! Yes. But I thought you knew that already. No, I didn't. [ROSHI] Ohh, I remember Gohan speaking of a child with a tail. [ROSHI] So that's him, huh? [ROSHI] Gohan must be training the boy himself. So tell me, kid. How is your Grandpa doing? Grandpa died a long time ago. He did! Oh, I see. I'm very sorry to hear that. Hey. I've got a great idea. Why don't you come to stay with me on my island and I'll train you personally! Ooh, it would be a great honor to have the same teacher my Grandpa had! [YAMCHA] What's this? Master Roshi doesn't take on students easily. And there he is, asking little monkey boy. [PUAR] Maybe we should just forget about the Dragon Balls. Hey, no wait. All we have to do is grab that stupid little tail of his and he'll be like putty in our hands. But what if we're not able to get to his tail, Yamcha? Just leave that to me and my Wolf Fang Fist. [OOLONG] This is ridiculous, Bulma. I'm calling it quits. [BULMA] Well, it's got to be here somewhere. I found it! [BULMA] Yeah! Check it out! Now there's only one more to go! Fabulous! [BULMA] Woo-hoo! Yippee! [GOKU] Sounds like Bulma found it. Hey, who did this? I did! You blew up our car, you dummy! Please, take one of my cars. [BULMA] Oh my gosh. [OX-KING] The boy has done so well today. I think he deserves a little reward, don't you? Oh my. Thank you! Thanks Ox-King! I really like it! That last ball's pretty far... Wow. [BULMA] I'm going to have to switch my radar over to long range. [BULMA] Ah, there it is. All right you guys. C'mon, let's go! --Goodbye! You've been great! --Goodbye! Thanks for the ride! [BULMA] And thank you so much for the Dragon Ball! Hold it!! Have you forgotten something? Your promise! Yeah, I remember. The promise. Right. [BULMA] Oolong! [BULMA] Quiet! Listen! I promised that old goat I'd take some stupid walk with him around his island. Well, I just don't have the time for that. I need you to change shape and take my place. No arguing! You do it or I'll say the "P" word! Now you listen here, sister! Go ahead and do your worst, because I will not stoop that low! I do have some semblance of dignity left. Okay, have it your way, piggy. Alright, alright, I'll do it! [ROSHI] ♪ Buffalo girls won't you come out tonight. ♪  [ROSHI] ♪ Doot doo doo... ♪ How's this?? That looks nothing like me you moron! Well, excuse me. There, how's this? You satisfied? Great! That's perfect! Now, you just disguise your voice make sure that old geezer doesn't know the difference! Dumb bunny. [OOLONG] Master Roshi! [OOLONG] All right. Let's see how Bulma likes this! Now I know we only planned on a moonlight stroll, but as long as you're coming to the island-- Master Roshi... Yes, what is it, my sweet? You are so incredibly sexy. I just loved the way you blew up that mountain! Well you know, just one of the things I do. Even now, my heart's still beating like a drum! --Boom-boom! --Boom-boom! Boom-boom! What does that stupid pig think he's doing?! Just look... [OOLONG] can't you tell? [ROSHI] Boom-boom! [ROSHI] Boom-boom! [ROSHI] Boom-boom! Roshi, you are truly the luckiest man alive. [BULMA] What were you thinking, Oolong?! I'm so mad at you right now I could just--ooh! What's up? Oh, nothing. I was just wondering if you're ever going to think about me again. Yeah, I think so. Oh my, you're so funny. Do you think you're ever going to think about me again, ChiChi? Oh my gosh! --[BULMA] Bye-bye! --[OOLONG] See you later! --Thanks again! --We'll miss you! [GOKU] Thanks for the Dragon Ball! Looks like it's time to be on our way, Puar. We've got to follow those three to the last of the Dragon Balls. Okay! [PUAR] Ready for takeoff! [BULMA] Whoa! Flying's definitely the way to go! This is great! It's incredible! [NARRATOR] Yamcha will be keeping a close eye on our heroes as they embark on their journey towards the seventh, and final, Dragon Ball. Tune in next time, as the adventure continues!
