 [NARRATOR] Last time on Dragon Ball: the Dragon Balls were stolen from the hands of our heroes by Emperor Pilaf's bumbling henchmen, Mai and Shu. Goku led a brave trek into Emperor Pilaf's palace to retrieve the stolen balls. Once inside, everyone followed the writing on the ground. [YAMCHA] It's a trap. Don't you think? [NARRATOR] Carefully, the team crept through the caverns, trying to avoid any unforeseen dangers. [crash] [NARRATOR] But when the wall came crashing down, our heroes found themselves trapped in the cold corridor.

 And now they wait, wondering what the evil Emperor Pilaf has in store for them next! Nope, I don't think it's in here. [SHU] Me, neither. C'mon, let's rip the seats open. We've got to find that Dragon Ball. Well, looks like we're stuck here. [OOLONG] Wonderful! Now I get to die today, too! Hey, what's wrong? Why're you so upset? Because we're prisoners. [GOKU] Oh, don't worry about that. If there's a way in. there's gotta be a way out. Goku, they're going to try to kill us! Ha! Scary!

 [BULMA] Don't you take anything seriously?! [PILAF] Those ignorant buffoons! Yes, I really do have to hand it to myself, though. The old "Follow the Pink Arrow" trap gets 'em every time! [laughing] [SHU] Sire! [PILAF] Speak to me. Sir, we searched the aircar that they came here in, but the last Dragon Ball definitely isn't in it. [PILAF] No?! That means one of them must be carrying it! [MAI] You know, you can never trust a short person. Surely one of those little runts is hiding the Dragon Ball from us! [PILAF] That will be the last time you run down short people in my presence, Agent Mai. And stop calling me 'Shirley'. Do I make myself clear? Oh, yes, sir. I don't know what I was thinking... You ready? Let's do it! Wolf Fang Fist! Haah! [blows landing] [blows landing] [YAMCHA] I... I didn't even put a dent in it! The wall is too strong. [GOKU] Why don't we give it another try? Don't hurt yourself. [laughing] What's wrong, fools? Can't break my triple-butted double-reinforced steel-lined walls, can you? [BULMA] Who are you? I am the all-powerful Emperor Pilaf! So you're the jerk that stole my Dragon Balls! Yes, this is true, but I didn't get all of them now, did I? [GOKU] Yamcha, I think I can get him if I dive through that window. That's a TV set, you dummy. I know that one of you is carrying the four-star ball. Hand it over to me and things will go much easier for you. [BULMA] Maybe in the next millennium, pal! Check this: bleh! So, that's how you want to play it, little girl? All right, then. Time for the "Treatment"! [screaming] Oh, no! He's got her! Hey, uh, what did he mean by the "Treatment"? I... think I know... Get me out of this thing! Right now, you freak! [PILAF] You insolent brat! I am the great Emperor Pilaf and I will be the only one giving orders here today! Tell me where the last Dragon Ball is! Now! My magic finger says it's somewhere in the ceiling! I see, you actually want the "Treatment", don't you? Oh, you'll wish I would have killed you. [maniacal laughter] [YAMCHA] He better not lay a hand on her! [OOLONG] Serves her right. Not the "Treatment"! Have a heart! No, please, Emperor! There! Now, you'll tell me exactly what I want to hear! That's it? A kiss? Uh, yes. Pretty scary, don't you think? [whimpering] [shy chuckling] Is that the best you can do? Boy, she's pushing it! She'd better clam up or he may think of something really horrible to do to her! Man, I thought you guys were tough! That was easy! A first-grader could think of better torture than the "Treatment"! What?! Did you hear what she just said?! [MAI and SHU] Yes, Emperor! [PILAF] I'll have you know I got my degree in torture! I am a certified master of torture! Ooh, that does it! [YAMCHA] You okay? [BULMA] Nice catch, you guys. [PILAF] This'll take time. Time to devise the ultimate torture. [SHU] I say we go right for the Dragon Ball! [PILAF] Quiet, Shu! I'm devising! But, sire. We could gas them and then conduct a search. Gas! Yes, great idea! Let's give them some Yellow #3. [coughing] [OOLONG] Sleeping gas! [coughing] [OOLONG] They're trying to knock us all out... [BULMA] Goku... I can't stay awake much longer... [snoring] [PILAF] Emperor Pilaf will always prevail, kiddies! Yes, you think you can outsmart me? Well, I'll tell you, ah... I... uh... I tell you... quite the... [SHU] Oh, Emperor! [MAI] How fitting. A victim of his own vapors. Shu, you take the Emperor back to his chambers. I'll look for the ball. [SHU] Alrighty. [MAI] Let's see here... Nope... Nothing here... What do we have here? Ahh, that's the one! Now we can summon the Eternal Dragon! [WOMAN] Pilaf! Did you steal those Dragon Balls?! [PILAF] Mommy? [MAI] Emperor Pilaf... Emperoror Pilaf... Emperoror Pilaf! I have great news! [MAI] We got it! We've recovered the four-star Dragon Ball, sir. [PILAF] You did?! [MAI] Finally. The boy with the tail had it, but here they all are. Take a look. [SHU] They're beautiful, sire! They're all mine! [snoring] [BULMA screaming] The Dragon Ball! It's gone! It's gone! Goku, you gotta wake up! They took it! The four-star ball is gone! Gone! They've got all seven of them, now! Good, you're awake! I'm exhausted. Then wake up, 'cause your Dragon Ball is gone! No way! I hid that! Oh, what if that crazy little troll already used the balls to summon the dragon?! Great! Hey, look, the cell door's open. [BULMA] Do you think they forgot to close it? [GOKU] It could be another trap. [YAMCHA] Yeah, but why would they set another trap for us if we were already trapped? [BULMA] Hey, Yamcha's right. I say we go for it! [YAMCHA] All right, then! Very soon, the world will be mine! Have you made your wish? [PILAF] Uh-uh... Give me back my Grandpa! [screaming] Quick, get 'em! [BULMA] Now which way?! [YAMCHA] What do you think, Goku? Gee, I-I don't know! How did they escape from such a well-designed trap? You forgot to close the wall, didn't you? I don't know, I thought you were the last one out! Exactly how stupid are you guys?! [MAI and SHU] Very stupid, sir. Well. don't expect to see any allowances this week. And yes, you can forget about desert as well. [MAI and SHU] But sire--! [PILAF] Silence! Now, let's see here... Pinball! That's the penalty! [piano note] [rumbling] [screaming] [bells dinging] [piano playing] [bells dinging] [discordant piano playing] [screaming] [crash] C'mon, Goku, we're leaving! [GOKU] Ow, ow, ow, ow... [disocrdant piano playing] [screaming] [discordant piano playing] [screaming] Take that, you oversized ball bearing! You lose! [screaming] You just had to open your mouth, didn't you?! Like I knew the ball had an IQ! [crashing] [discordant piano playing] [crashing] [discordant piano playing] [screaming] I don't wanna die like this! I'm not wearing clean underwear! --[crashing] --[screaming] --[crashing] --[screaming] [YAMCHA] It looks like there's a tunnel behind that curtain! It could be a way out of here, or a trap. [BULMA] What should we do? [YAMCHA] I don't know. I want my mommy... [screaming] [discordant piano playing] [gasping] [screaming] [YAMCHA] No! We're trapped! [screaming] [whimpering] [GOKU] It stopped!  That's weird. Are we alive? [crash] [GOKU] You know, there's something familiar about this room. [BULMA] No! It's the same room we started in! [laughter] Excellent. You're all safe. That's nice. I was worried you wouldn't be able to see me crowned supreme ruler of the world! Well, I've got to go make my wish. I'll see you at my inauguration, okay? Bye. My hour of glory is finally at hand! Its time to summon the dragon! [maniacal laughter] Oh no! There's got to be a way out of this tomb! Goku! You have to use the Kamehameha Wave! I'm afraid it's our only hope right now! I can try. [GOKU] But how do you know about the Kamehameha Wave? Never mind that, Goku! We need every second we can get! Now hurry! Right. I'll do it! Yes! It is time to call the Eternal Dragon! Ka... me... ha... me... Ha! Oops! I guess I need a little more practice. Look at that hole. It's pretty small, huh? [YAMCHA] Thanks, Goku. Move it! Look! There they are right there! It looks like they're about to call the dragon. We've got to stop them! [YAMCHA] Wait, I've got it! Puar, you think you can turn into a bat, fly down there, and try and steal one of those Dragon Balls? Sure! Great idea! Oolong, go help her, now! Huh? Why should I? 'Cause I'll yell 'piggy' every ten seconds until you do! Easy now, Bulma, just settle down! Alright! Hurry up, Oolong! [OOLONG] I am hurrying! Rise Eternal Dragon! And hear the wish of he who summons you! [screaming] [whimpering] [NARRATOR] Will Emperor Pilaf's wish be granted? Or will Puar and Oolong be able to save our heroes and the world? Find out next time on Dragon Ball! [roaring]
