 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, a mysterious girl named Launch joined Goku and Krillin on Master Roshi's island. And now the friendly foursome is packing up for a new adventure. How're we gonna get there? [GOKU] It'll be a tight squeeze on the Nimbus Cloud. This will cut it! [NARRATOR] The old teacher has finally agreed to train Goku and Krillin, and so they're moving to a larger island. [ROSHI] Master Roshi's rule number one: Travel in style! [ROSHI] Can you do me a favor, Launch?

 [LAUNCH] Huh? Well, uh, try not to sneeze, kay? Yes, I'll try! [NARRATOR] Master Roshi's request has nothing to do with hygiene. As he and the boys learned the hard way, Launch goes through an amazing transformation every time she sneezes. Changing from a gentle girl to a vengeful vixen with an itchy trigger-finger! And she won't be pushed around! [LAUNCH] Wanna dress me like a doll? Then please, don't forget... [LAUNCH] the accessory machine gun! [screaming] [NARRATOR] Needless to say, Master Roshi, Goku, and Krillin

 will be staying on their toes. But hey, there's plenty of reason to smile! Now that Master Roshi has a girl to keep him company, the boys will learn the ways of martial arts! Training starts today on Dragon Ball! [ROSHI] Anyone up for a short martial arts lesson before dinner? [KRILLIN] Of course, Master! [ROSHI] Yes, I find it helps digestion. Hey, where's Goku?! [LAUNCH] Oh, I know! He said he'd have a look around the island, and then he went off on that funny cloud. Wooaah... [GOKU] Yeah! [laughing] [GOKU] Wa-hoo! [laughing] Master Roshi, I think someone beat us to the island. [ROSHI] About three hundred someones to be exact. But don't worry, they just live here. They're not competition. Now, let's have a lesson! You mean it?! Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah! Yeah-yeah! [KRILLIN] Hmph, what a child! Just wait 'til he sees what a real fighter can do. Should I be training too? [ROSHI] Uh? That's up to you, as long as we can hide the machine gun... Well, I guess I'll train if you guys are. Ah... ah... ah...! [screaming] [yawning] [ROSHI] Eh? [LAUNCH] Actually, fighting puts me to sleep! I'll go make some food! Guess she was just yawning... That was scary! Krillin, how dare you be scared! A martial arts expert must never be afraid! [KRILLIN] Sorry. I'll try to be more like you. Now, let's continue with our fearless training. [ROSHI] Krillin, do you have any fighting experience? Yes, I studied for eight years at the Magic Orin Temple! [ROSHI] Alright, then, very good. I suppose I can skip the lesson on what a punch and a kick are. [ROSHI] Now, before I teach you boys anything new, I'll need to test your current ability. [ROSHI] Let's see... We'll start from over here... and finish at that tree. That's about a hundred meters, right? [ROSHI] Where's my stopwatch?! You want us to race? [ROSHI] Running is a good test of speed and strength, though of course if you're an expert fighter, you shouldn't be the one who has to run away. [chuckling] I'll run first, Master Roshi. [ROSHI] Ooh, confident, are ya? Well, you'll both see why. I could probably make the Olympics... if I wanted to. On your mark! [KRILLIN] Hmm... [ROSHI] Get set! [GOKU laughing] Hit it! [panting] My, my! You ran it in ten-point-four seconds! Well, that's... pretty darn good. Yeah, yeah... It's an okay run... I usually make it around ten-point-one. I don't know what happened, but I guess the wind was against me! [GOKU] Yoo-hoo! Master Roshi! [GOKU] Can I take a turn at it now?! [ROSHI] Well, let's not get antsy! [ROSHI] Now, on your mark. [ROSHI] Get set! What an amateur. Go! [GOKU] Uh? Maybe he's a bit faster than I thought... Let's see, now... looks like eleven seconds even. That's a good finish, but Krillin, I'd say you still beat him hands down. Oh, it's really not fair to compare him to me. [KRILLIN] I set the bar pretty high, you know. Yes, well, for rookies, you both have good potential. [GOKU] Master Roshi, can I try again with different shoes? Don't be a sore loser and try blame your shoes, Goku. Look at mine. They're not exactly meant for running either, now are they? But at least yours aren't all torn up. [GOKU] I can see my toes! [GOKU laughing] Ha! Much Better! Okay! I'm ready! [ROSHI] Alright! Get on your mark! [ROSHI] Get set! [ROSHI] Go! [KRILLIN whimpering] Wow. Eight seconds flat. Was I fast? Who... taught you how to-to run like that? What do you mean? No one taught me. That'd be silly! Well, for two young men, you're at the top of your league. [chuckling] [ROSHI] But that's not good enough! [ROSHI] See boys, to be truly great fighters, you must learn to go beyond the limits of normal people. And that's no cakewalk. [ROSHI] I'll let you be the timekeeper. And whose time am I keeping? Mine, of course. I just hope I'm still in shape. [grunting] [GOKU] Okay, Master Roshi, are you ready?! [ROSHI] That's a good question... [ROSHI] Oh yeah! I think I'm ready! [KRILLIN] Okay! Then, on your mark! Get set...! Go! That's moving! What's my time? Five-point-six seconds! Five-and-six tenths, huh? Not too bad. Can you teach us to do that?! [ROSHI] What, throw a purple turtle shell? [ROSHI] Oh, right, the running. Of course! It's just a matter of surpassing normal human limitations. Gee, all that running made my tongue dry. [ROSHI] Goku, grab me a brewsky! Okay... What's a brewsky? Don't worry, Master, I gotcha! Ugh, Goku, I have many things to teach you besides fighting. Now, are you sure you weren't raised in a bubble? [laughing] Oh, wow! Master Roshi really is strong! He's not just a dirty, old man after all! [KRILLIN] Launch! Which way is the refrigerator? [LAUNCH] Careful! You're blowing up dust! [KRILLIN] What? [LAUNCH] Ah... Ah... Ah-choo! That's no yawn! [LAUNCH] Slow down, you little pig! [KRILLIN screaming] [LAUNCH] How's about I cook you for dinner?! Oh, look at that! Krillin just ran the hundred-meter in just eight-point-eight seconds! That's much better than before! [LAUNCH] You can't run forever, you little porker! [LAUNCH] Ah-choo! Oh, that's funny, I thought for sure I was in the kitchen! [LAUNCH] Oh, look, I dropped my knife! [KRILLIN whimpering] [ROSHI] And that's a brief explanation of how to go beyond your limits. Am I making any sense? [GOKU] Mm-hmm! [ROSHI] Good. Then we'll work on applying it tomorrow morning. Now, you boys have one more task to perform before we go inside to that wonderful smelling supper! Are we running? [ROSHI] No, it's a different kind of test. [ROSHI] Take a good look at this stone. [ROSHI] Have you memorized it? I think so. Are you going to eat it? [ROSHI] What? No, Goku! Oh, yeah! Still got the old arm. The test is to throw stones? Master Roshi, your training sure is kind of weird. Throwing stones is not the test here. [GOKU and KRILLIN] Huh The test is to find mine. Wha--? You mean the one you just threw? [ROSHI] Anyone can throw a stone, just like anyone can throw a punch. But to find a stone takes a focused mind and a calm spirit. This is what will separate you from the others. [ROSHI] And so, the person who finds it can keep the stone, and the one who doesn't can keep their appetite. [GOKU and KRILLIN] You mean... no supper?! [ROSHI] That's right! And if no one brings the stone back in thirty minutes, then neither of you gets to eat! Now, hurry up, boys! Time's already started! [ROSHI] Watch out for snakes! [shouting] [KRILLIN] Darn it! There's no way down! We'd better find a detour, quick! [GOKU laughing] Are you crazy?! Don't worry! I did this all the time back in the mountains! Haah! [GOKU screaming] Ooh, that one really hurt! [GOKU] But I've got to get my supper! [GOKU] Hello, stone! Where are you?! [KRILLIN] That guy can't be human! And now he's way ahead of me! [panicked wailing] Hmm... [KRILLIN] Hold up, there's no way I can find that stone in half an hour, especially with Goku taking leaps like that. [KRILLIN] Maybe there's a... [snickering] [KRILLIN] Ooh, you sly, sly dog. [snickering] [sniffing] Ahh, fortune smiles on Krillin. [KRILLIN] Hello! Hello! Man at the door! Hmm... where's the man? [KRILLIN] I'm the man, ma'am, and I need to borrow a pen! It's an emergency! A pen? [KRILLIN] Yes, please. [sniffing] Smells like sweat and turtle shell. I'm closer. Perfect-o! Thank you! [KRILLIN laughing] [WOMAN] Tiny, little thing... Now, all I have to do is act like I had a really hard time finding it! [chuckling] [LAUNCH humming] [ROSHI] Now, this is a magic moment... [LAUNCH humming] So, Launch, whatcha shaking up for dinner? [LAUNCH] Stew! I got a really good deal from a man at the fish market. Ohh... great... sounds tasty... [LAUNCH humming] [excited grunting] Master Roshi! [LAUNCH] Huh? [panting] [LAUNCH] Hey, Krillin! [ROSHI squealing] [panting] Huh? What... were you doing? [ROSHI laughing] [ROSHI] G-Gotta go! [panting] [KRILLIN] It was hard, but I found it. Good job. Very quick! Nice try, lame-o, but that's not my handwriting! [ROSHI] Now get out! [KRILLIN] Sorry! Man, I'll never find, anything in this jungle. --[roaring] --[screaming] Whoah! That was close! Huh? [deep growling] What kind of a jungle am I in?! [GOKU laughing] [GOKU] I found it! Oh! It's Goku! Stay right where you are, Goku! I'm coming your way! Please don't go anywhere! I found it! Mmm... Now, I can have my supper! How in the world did you find that, Goku?! It smells like Master Roshi! What are you, a dog?! Wait. I think that stone might be a decoy. What do you mean? It has his handwriting on it and everything! Lots of stuff has his writing on it! He owns this place! Oh, really? I'll check it for you. [KRILLIN] Hmm.... [KRILLIN laughing] [screaming] [GOKU] You're cheating! Give me back that stone! I'm sorry, Goku! But I stole it fair and square! [shouting] [panting] [shouting] Uh? Uwah? [screaming] [snickering] What a well-earned meal! [GOKU shouting] Huh? Huhh?! [shouting] Boy, he's persistent! Well, here I go! Let's brawl! I'd love to! But first, you have to promise you won't cry to Master Roshi if I cause you death or permanent injury Sure! If you swear to fight once without cheating! [growling] [blows landing] [shouting] [whimpering] You give up? Oh yeah! Then you have to give the stone back. Well, I can't argue with you. The rock is rightfully yours. So... take it! [GOKU screaming] [GOKU] Wait up, stone! [KRILLIN guffawing] And that's what I call... smooth! [ROSHI] Hmm... [softly chuckling] [ROSHI] I know I shouldn't, but... [ROSHI grunting] [ROSHI] So... close... I've got it! Do you time this?! But now I've got the real one! What do you know? This one is real. Good job, Krillin. [ROSHI] You've redeemed yourself! Yes, thank you. [laughing] [ROSHI] Dig in, Krillin! [LAUNCH] Do you like it? You bet! Would you like more to drink, Master Roshi? Oh-ho, you read my mind! Well, I didn't know you were such a gourmet cook, Launch! Thank you very much! Just thank the fish! [laughing] [KRILLIN] Oh, thank you, fish! [GOKU moaning] Yummy! What's in this tasty stew? [LAUNCH] Let's see... what did that man call it? Oh! It's a puffer fish! [KRILLIN] Hmm?! Puf...fer fish? [ROSHI] But that's... poisonous! Oh, I... feel ill. So do I! Oh, I didn't know! [moaning] [coughing, retching] [rooster crowing] [GOKU laughing] [GOKU] What a beautiful day! Come on, Master Roshi! Let's train now! I... think we'll take the day off... [ROSHI groaning] [NARRATOR] Martial Arts training will continue on the island. Just as soon as Krillin and Master Roshi can pick themselves up off the floor! On the next Dragon Ball!
