 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball, Goku and his new acquaintance Krillin set out on the Nimbus Cloud with a mission: find a girl for Master Roshi to date! And until the boys complete this task, Master Roshi won't teach them martial arts! [GOKU] I wonder where we should look...? How about not so high in the air? [KRILLIN screaming] Slow down! You know if I lose my grip on you, I'll fall through this cloud! Well, if you would stop thinking bad thoughts,

 then it wouldn't be a problem! [KRILLIN] Fat chance. Hey, Krillin, look, do you think Master Roshi would like that lady over there? [KRILLIN] You mean I have to look down? [KRILLIN] Goku! That's a man! [GOKU] Really?! How can you tell? Gosh, they all look pretty much the same to me! [KRILLIN] You're joking, right? I mean you really can't tell the difference? Well, usually I can figure it out. I just have to touch them first! In case you can't tell, I'm a boy. [piano music playing]

 [patrons chatting] [MAN] You sure Launch will come here? You just leave them plans to me, Tall Man! I know she's a-comin'! [whimpering] You think we'll be alright? Heard she didn't leave a blade of cattle-grass standin' last time! Tubbs, you're an idiot. The day I get bested by a lone woman is the day I sell my horse and go home. Gosh! It's so dusty today and I just washed my hair! It ain't her. [WOMAN] Phew, what a mess! I don't know where I am... Barman, I'll pay for whatever drink the lady wants. Huh? [TALL MAN] Hmm. Don't ask me why, ma'am, but, something about you reminds me of a girl I once loved. [MAN 2] Listen, partner, we're on the look out! We don't got no time to be flirtin' with harmless ladies! [TALL MAN] Mind your own, hear me?! Mind your own! [TALL MAN] Sorry about that. Now what can I get you? There are so many things I like! How about a fresh glass of orange juice over ice? [BARTENDER] Comin' up! [BARTENDER] There you go, sweetheart! [sniffing] Ah... A-Achoo! [WOMAN chuckling] [TALL MAN] Uwaah! [WOMAN chuckling] [whimpering] [WOMAN] Anyone else wanna call me their "sweetheart"?! [groaning] Haven't you finished yet, Krillin? Hey-hey-hey! What are you doing here?! Go away and mind your own business! [GOKU] You're right, Krillin! You are a boy. [KRILLIN] Goku! [train whistle blowing] [distant train chugging] [engine idling] [WOMAN] It's showtime. [brakes squealing] [WOMAN] Thank you, sweetie! I'll just be taking this! That's right, Sheriff, she derailed the train! I am positive it was Launch! [engine revving] [KRILLIN] Where are you taking us, Goku? I doubt we'll find anyone in the middle of the desert! Hey, why does Master Roshi want to meet a girl so bad anyway? Well, I guess that he likes going on dates just as much as you like food! You mean he's going to eat her?! [KRILLIN] No, Goku, he's not... [police sirens] [LAUNCH chuckling] [POLICEMAN] Pull over, Launch, or we're going to shoot! [POLICEMAN] Look out! [POLICEMAN 2] You're going to pay for that, you vandal! [POLICEMAN 2] How'd she do that?! [POLICEMAN 2] There she is! [LAUNCH] These boys with their pitiful aim. [LAUNCH] Guess I'll show 'em how it's done. [screaming] [LAUNCH laughing] [sniffing] Oh no, not now! Ah... Ah... Achoo! [LAUNCH] Help me! [GOKU] Did you hear that? I thought I heard someone say "help"... Then let's keep going! "Help" only means something dangerous is about to happen! [GOKU] Let's find it! Just stay where you are, Launch! Your crime spree is finally over! Move and we'll shoot! [LAUNCH] I-I-I don't understand... Who are you? E-Enough with the games, Launch! We're police officers and we-I mean-you are under arrest! [LAUNCH] Oh, that's awful! What have I done? Well, just about every crime that we punish in these parts! [POLICEMAN 3] And I assure you, it's enough to put you away for a long time! [whimpering] [screaming] Someone help! Huh? Oh? It was probably just a bird or something... [GOKU] Hey! Right there! But that girl's being attacked! Shouldn't we do something to help her out, Krillin? Yes, well, that would be the heroic thing to do. [KRILLIN] Except for, we haven't even had our first lesson! [KRILLIN] And they've got guns, and handcuffs, and- Oh, I'd say our odds are pretty lousy... Well in that case, we should move in quick! [KRILLIN] Wait! --Oh, no! --A monster! What are you?! I'm here to save that girl! He's a kid! I'd like to point out that this is all his idea and I am not involved. I fully respect you guys. You must be crazy if you think I'm gonna give up catching Launch 'coz some child stood in my way! Hah! [grunting] Scoundrel! [GOKU] That wasn't very hard. Oh, thank you very much! I get so frightened when I look at guns! [KRILLIN] Oh, it was nothing for us pros! Krillin! You think that Master Roshi would like this girl? Huh? Mm-hmm. What? We really appreciate you coming home with us... [LAUNCH] And where is home? We're staying with the Turtle Hermit! Turtle Hermit? [GOKU] Yup! [GOKU] He lives on a little island in the ocean! [GOKU] He's kind of silly, but we like him! [LAUNCH] How nice! Look, Launch! [GOKU] There it is! [LAUNCH] Ooh! It's a very pretty house! [KRILLIN] Yeah, I'm still getting used to the pink. Hey, Master Roshi, we're back! There's a girl here who wants to meet you! How come he never answers his door? It is possible he's just using the bathroom, Goku. Why's he taking a bath? It's the nice way of saying "toilet"! You mean he's taking a poo? Oh, I'll go tell him to hurry up, okay? That Goku's not one for manners, is he? Now, Krillin, you still haven't told me the reason that I'm here. Yes, well, I'm not really sure myself. Master Roshi is a lonely guy who likes to think he's a stud. So we just need someone to play along and feed his ego. Oh, does that mean I can hide here while I'm running away? Running a...? You mean from those guys who were attacking you and pretending to be police officers? So, who were they really? They were real policemen! U-Uh? [GOKU] Uh, Master Roshi! Get off the toilet! There's a girl downstairs! [ROSHI] Darn it, Goku! I said hold on! [toilet flushing] Do you have to scream it all over the house?! It's plain embarrassing! [GOKU] You're stinky! And why exactly would the police be after you? I can't say for sure, but judging from all the money in my bag, I probably held up a bank or two. [ROSHI] I sure hope you brought me a nice one this time... [GOKU] I guess so? Whenever Krillin sees her, he smiles a whole lot. Something about a train...? [KRILLIN laughing] Oh, right, you're a train-robber. You expect me to believe that? [KRILLIN] You're so silly, Launch. [KRILLIN] Robbing trains and stuff is a job for big strong guys, and you're a pretty girl! [LAUNCH] You might want to watch what you say, Krillin. When I sneeze, I change, and terrible things can happen! [KRILLIN] You mean like a runny nose? [ROSHI] Hi! I think I'm in love! That's good, right? Oh my goodness, you frightened me! So, Master Roshi, what do you think of her? She's been making up some silly stories about robbing trains, but other than that, she totally fits the bill. [ROSHI] Mm-hmm! I'm making you both my students from this day forward! [GOKU and KRILLIN] Yeah! Hey! I'm Master Roshi, and this is my pad! Nice to meet you, sir. My name is Launch. Your grandsons saved me from a whole lot of trouble today. Oh, is that really true, boys? [chuckling] Yes, I can't thank them enough. All in a day's work. I'm glad you're safe, but to be honest they're not my grandsons. Oh. They're my younger brothers! [ROSHI] It was worth a try. [laughing] Funny joke, wasn't it? [LAUNCH laughing] Oh, yes! Actually, I'm the Turtle Hermit Master Roshi, the world's greatest expert at martial arts, and these boys have come to train under me. Martial arts, huh? Well, that explains why Goku's so strong. Yes, I'm happy to hear my lessons made a difference. But, Master Roshi, you haven't taught me anything yet. So, anyway, Launch, since you're my special guest and all, how would you like to take a romantic walk with me around my island paradise? Well... it doesn't look like a very long walk. [LAUNCH] But yeah, that sounds pleasant to me. [ROSHI] Y-You mean it?! Oh boy! [ROSHI laughing] [KRILLIN] I think he liked that answer. And while you're here, you might as well study martial arts with us too. I... don't know... I have soft hands, and I've never been very interested in fighting. Well, there are many benefits of martial arts besides being able to beat the tar out of people, you know. [ROSHI] It increases your physical stamina, it's good for the noggin', and... it... uh, it's good on your oily pores. I wouldn't pass up this opportunity, Launch! Master Roshi is a legend in the martial arts world! [KRILLIN] Lots of people would do anything for a lesson from him. It's like a collector's item. Wow! Then of course I will. Yeah... I guess there's no point in denying my greatness. Can we please start now? Thanks for the plug, kid. You know I aim to please. [GOKU] Where's he going now? First, let's put our uniforms on! Right! [GOKU] Uniforms? Woah, you can change in the house, if you want! Okay. Yes, that's a good idea. Now why in the world did you have to bring that up?! I panicked... [ROSHI] Hurry up and change into these! [GOKU] Eww! I'm not wearing that! [ROSHI] You will if you want lessons! This is the only way my plan will work! [LAUNCH] I'm back! This looks like underwear... Oh, no, it's... uh.... "Turtle Hermit Fighting Armor"! Clever name... [LAUNCH] Okay, but it doesn't seem to protect much... [ROSHI] I knew these outfits would come in handy. Now we'll start off with aerobics! Would ya leave me alone! [sniffing] Ah... ah...! Oh, it's coming! Ah... ah... ahchoo! [LAUNCH growling] Okay, boys, whose idea was this?! [LAUNCH] Wanna dress me like a doll?! Well, then, please don't forget... [LAUNCH] the accessory machine gun! Oh dear! S-Sorry! You see? My other half comes out when I sneeze, and she doesn't like pigheaded boys! Did she do anything bad to you? Not... too... bad... [screaming] Oh... ow! [NARRATOR] With the mysterious Launch moving in, maybe the boys will learn to behave themselves. At least, if they want to hold on to their skin.
