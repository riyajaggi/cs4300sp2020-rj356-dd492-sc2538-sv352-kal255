 [NARRATOR] Our heroes, Goku and Bulma, along with Oolong the  shape-changing pig, are unaware that they're still being tailed by Yamcha and Puar as they follow their radar to the seventh, and final, Dragon Ball! [BULMA] It won't be long now, you guys! [BULMA] Wow! I can't believe I'm so close to having my wish fulfilled! I wonder what he's going to look like? [OOLONG] Hey, I've been meaning to ask. So this big wish-- there's gonna be enough for all of us, right?

 I was thinking along the lines of all the gold in the world! [BULMA] Oh, I forgot to tell you didn't I? A boyfriend! That's what I'll wish for! [OOLONG] What?! A boyfriend?! [BULMA] What's wrong? [OOLONG] So you're gonna waste our wish so you can get yourself a boyfriend? What a rip off! [BULMA] What?! You take that back! I think that you're just jealous! [OOLONG] I knew I should have stayed at home! [BULMA] Whoa! Slow down! [GOKU] Look out! [OOLONG] Huh? --[BULMA screaming] --[brakes screeching]

 [BULMA] Learn how to drive! [cawing] [PUAR] Hey Yamcha , I'm beginning to think they're lost. I can't believe the last Dragon Ball is way out here! [YAMCHA] Be patient. Puar, It's out there, I know it is! I can feel it--we're close! Real close! Soon I will wish away my fear of women! --[gasping] --[running footsteps] [SHU] I'm gonna be toast if I don't get to that meeting with Emperor PIlaf! [PILAF] Mai, if you don't fix that Dragon Ball detector by the time I count to ten, then you will be joining my hungry friends here for lunch! [roaring] One... Two... Three... Four... Five... [MAI] Uh, Emperor Pilaf! Speaking of lunch, you... you must be hungry right? [PILAF] Well, yes. I am hungry! Starving, really. You know, a hamburger would be nice right now. Hold it! What number was I on, Mai? [MAI] Huh? [PILAF] Nevermind. I'll start over. One, two, three Four. Five. Six. [screams] [MAI] Emperor Pilaf! [PILAF] What now? [MAI] Oh nothing, it's just... well, sometimes, when you take command like this, it's invigorating to be around you. [PILAF] Oh! I see! [roaring] Oh, right. Now where was I? [MAI] Huh? [PILAF] Okay, maybe I should start at... Six! [roaring] [SHU] I made it sire! I made it! [PILAF] Excellent, Shu, you're right on time. Now, have you located the balls? Report! [SHU] Well, I ordered pizza. [MAI] Sire, I fixed it! [MAI] The Dragon Ball detector is working and we're already receiving a signal on one of the balls. Attempting to isolate signal and increase magnification to level five. [MAI] Level six, seven, eight. Signal isolated at magnification level nine, sir! Oh my! This can't be! There's a ball just ten steps south of this location! And a couple of steps east. No, wait... it's south. By about... oh... I'd say seven paces. Then, six steps straight ahead and you're there! [SHU] I found it! [PILAF] Argh! Oh, what do we have here? Look, it's a Dragon Ball! The one we already have! That monkey-boy and his friends have the Dragon Balls we want, so where is he?! We have a spy bird tracking him. [MAI] Mecha number seven. There it is now, Emperor. [MAI] Once we download the visuals from Mecha 7, we'll know exactly where they are going. Ringleader, they just passed out of the northern quadrant and they're heading southwest! Over! [PILAF] Excellent! Tell big brother to engage! Roger! [MAI] Come in, big brother, do you copy? Over! [SHU] 10-4, baby sister! I got my ears on! The subject is approaching. [SHU] Okie-dokie! Over! Bulma, I'm going to ask you nicely this time. Would you please, please change your wish! There must be something you want that the three of us can split between us? Remember, Oolong, just one word from me and you'll have to go to the bathroom thanks to that pill! [growling] --[brakes squealing] --[screaming] Oolong, you're making me mad! [OOLONG] This is a protest, Bulma! I'm not moving another inch until you change your wish to something reasonable! Sure! I wish you'd just shut your face and drive! [SHU giggling] Now I've got 'em! This could take all day, Puar. [growling] Look, we've come all this way! Let's just shut up and go for it! Not this pig! Piggy! Piggy! Piggy! That's not fair! [explosive diarrhea] [SHU] They're sitting ducks! [giggling] I hope your new boyfriend comes with diapers. [grumbling] [screaming] What happened? Ow! Uh? We got blown up! Think we should help them?! In a minute, Puar! [OOLONG] Oh no! Wow! What is that? [SHU] I've come to repossess your Dragon Balls! Thank you! And so long, suckers! [SHU] The balls are mine now! [laughing] [mechanical springing] That thing just stole our Dragon Balls! 'Reposessed' them. It stole them! Goku, you're our only hope! Hurry! Call the Flying Nimbus! Flying Nimbus! [GOKU] Hurry up, Nimbus! [BULMA] Get those Dragon Balls, Goku! We're counting on you! [engine sputtering] I think we actually did it, Shu! [SHU] Emperor Pilaf will be very happy! [SHU] Maybe he'll even stop yelling at us! [GOKU] There it is! Okay, monster! Don't you know it's not nice to steal stuff?! What's wrong with him? Hey, you, monster! Give me back those Dragon Balls or else! Maybe he's playing dead. Hello? Come on, wake up! Hey! That's it! Hand 'em over! [muttering] Hey, you! [crash] Stiff as board. Yup, he's dead. [BULMA] Oh, it sure is taking Goku a long time... Hey, kid, I got an idea! Forget that wish, okay? What? No way! Hey, I could be your boyfriend! Whatta ya say? Huh? I say thanks, but no thanks! Got it?! Yeah I got it. It's your loss. Yeah, right! Oh, now I see what you're after. You don't want a real hunk, do ya? You want some conjured up whipping boy from that dragon. What do you mean by that, huh?! [GOKU] Hey guys! [BULMA] Goku! That monster's dead! [BULMA] Uh, Goku? Who's got the Dragon Balls?! [GOKU] Uh, I don't know. It's all over! [sobbing] [BULMA] My boyfriend! It's not fair! They've probably summoned the Dragon already... But, I've still got one. Of course! They thought they could outsmart us! No way, mister! You did it! You're the best! Yay! I knew I could count on you! It was easy Bulma, honest! You don't have to thank me. You can thank me! Now! Let's get 'em! Let's get out there and find those Dragon Balls! They won't get far! Get in the car, you two! We can track them with my radar! [OOLONG] Hey, fearless leader! You forget? Our car got blown up! Ah-ah-ah! That's okay, Oolong. I still have my Dyno Caps! Oh, I forgot! They were in there with the Dragon Balls! [sobbing] [PUAR] What should we do, Yamcha? I think they need a lift. I know, and she scares me... Now what? No choice. We've gotta give them a ride. But Yamcha, what about your fear of girls?! I don't have a choice. If we don't help them now, we're never gonna get those Dragon Balls! [sobbing] Stop crying, we'll think of something, you'll see. You're just saying that. You're right. He is just saying that. Oh, would you keep quiet?! [YAMCHA] Hey, look who it is! [GOKU] Hey, Yamcha! Hi, Yamcha! What a coincidence! Are you guys stuck out here? Yeah! We were until you showed up. Could you give us a ride, Yamcha? Pretty please! Sure... we'd be... we'd be happy to... Yamcha, I know this might sound a little weird, but there's something I'd like you to do for me. Would you mind closing your eyes for a second? Please? Close my eyes? Yeah, just for a second. Pretty please? Well, what for? [BULMA] You'll see. Aw, come on. [YAMCHA] Oh no! Is she really gonna kiss me? I think I'm gonna die! You too, Puar! [BULMA] No peeking, you two! [BULMA] Hey, not too bad! [BULMA] They're only about twenty-five miles away! [YAMCHA] Can I open my eyes now? Sure, go ahead. Hey, nothing happened! Nothing happened... Nothing at all! Hey, something happened, I just can't say what. Us girls, we have to keep our secrets you know? Don't. Be. Mad. [YAMCHA screaming] That was weird. At last, I have all seven Dragon Balls! Uh, sire? [MAI] Uh... [PILAF] ♪ No more Dragon Ball blues da-da! ♪ But, uh, Emperor... We... uh? Uh, we need... one more! [PILAF] ♪ La-la-la ♪ There's only six! You counted wrong. [PILAF] Did I just hear you say we're missing a Dragon Ball? [MAI and SHU] Yes, sir! There's only six! [PILAF] That can't be! [PILAF] Seven, six, five... Uh? There's three, and the two ball and, uh, hmm, let's see, I-I have the one-star ball. And- Oh no! There's one missing! [PILAF] Is it there?! Nope! Sorry, boss! Fools! [PILAF screaming] And you call yourselves agents! We're very sorry, sir! Uh, I think six is pretty good, sire. We have to be better than 'pretty good' to win this game! This is the world we're talking about! [beeping] You did say you fixed this thing, didn't you? Yes, I did sire. [PILAF] Oh, goody! That means those kids with the last Dragon Ball are headed this way! Isn't that sweet? They're delivering it to us! Let's go set the traps for our guests! [BULMA] Look at the size of that place! [GOKU] It's huge! [OOLONG] Not bad for a summer home. [PUAR] Are you okay? I'm alright. I just need to make my wish. Then I'll be cured of this. [MAI] Everything is ready, sire. [PILAF] Excellent! Amateurs... They have no idea what they're getting into! Soon, they will feel the wrath of Pilaf. [GOKU] Looks like no one's home. [BULMA] See if it's open, Goku. [OOLONG] Um... I don't think that's a good idea. [BULMA] That's it! You got it Goku! Keep pushing! [gasping] [GOKU] Let's go! [BULMA] It's as dark as night in there! [OOLONG] Yeah! And twice as scary! [squeaking] Do you guys hear something? [BULMA] Shh! Quiet, Oolong! [YAMCHA] Oh no, bats! [screaming] What'd you do that for?! Uh, I thought you were a bat! [OOLONG] My piggy senses are tingling! We're in definite danger here! [BULMA] Oolong, less talking and more walking! [wind howling] [GOKU] It looks clear down this way, guys. [OOLONG] Goku, don't walk so fast! [BULMA] Shh! Perfect! [rumbling] --[crashing] --[screaming] Help me! [screaming] [crash] Got ya! [crashing] [crash] [crash] [crashing] [YAMCHA] A... little help? [GOKU] You guys okay? Alright! That does it! Let's go get 'em! Oh, thank you! You saved me! [YAMCHA screaming] Take a breath! Golly! [PILAF] That trap didn't work! Who designed that trap anyway? Uh, it wasn't me, sire. [PILAF] I want the name of the ninny who designed it! It was you. [BULMA] What's that sound? [OOLONG] It's just my teeth chattering! [YAMCHA] Be careful! There could be traps everywhere! [BULMA] Okay... [OOLONG] Puar, quit pushing, would ya! [PUAR] Then get moving, Oolong! [GOKU] Hey, what's that? It's a trap, isn't it? I don't know. It's too obvious. [GOKU] Hey there's another arrow over here! [YAMCHA] Let's check it out! [OOLONG] Excuse me, but where are we going, huh? [GOKU] It's a dead end! [OOLONG] Oh, did you have to say that, Goku? [YAMCHA] Oh no! [BULMA] We're trapped! So, Emperor, what do you want to do now? I think maybe I'll have some fun with them! Ah, yes. But first, I'll take their Dragon Ball!
