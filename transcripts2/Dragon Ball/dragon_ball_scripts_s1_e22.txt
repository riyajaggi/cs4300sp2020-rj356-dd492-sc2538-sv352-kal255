 [NARRATOR] Previously on Dragon Ball... The World Martial Arts Tournament opened with Krillin versus Bacterian -- owner of the nastiest finger that ever existed! [NARRATOR] Smell after raunchy smell, this king of funk hit Krillin with every foul odor the human body has to offer! And poor Krillin was stunned. [NARRATOR] Thanks to Goku's constant encouragement, Krillin was able to catch his second wind! Bacterian, however, had saved his deadliest attack for last-- the deep-throated,

 mucous-filled luggi of death! [NARRATOR] But Krillin prevailed, and put the big oaf to rest, with a whiff of his own medicine! [BACTERIAN] I'm done. [NARRATOR] Krillin has scored a victory over poor hygiene and advanced to the next round. But the celebration can't last long! It's time for another big match, today, on Dragon Ball! [CROWD cheering] [KRILLIN giggling] You did it! You beat him! Goku it was awesome! I don't know about you guys, but I loved that fight!

 I'd say that Krillin boy is goin' places! [WOMAN 1] Oh, but he's so little! I bet Master Roshi's going crazy! [KRILLIN chuckles] Hey... W-Where is he, anyway? [GOKU] Hey Bulma, do you know where Master Roshi is sitting? [BULMA] Sorry Goku, we lost track of him in the crowd. [PUAR] He keeps leaving us and we think it's to go look at girls... Well gee, that's not very nice. Then he didn't watch my fight? Oh hold on Krillin, maybe he did. [GOKU sniffing] I smell him! [CHUN laughs] May I ask what the lipstick is for, sweetie? Let's say it's for guys like you. Oh, well my name's Jackie Chun! Perhaps you and I can have some coffee? Sorry, but my attention is on someone else. [CHUN] Hm... Hey! I think she likes ya, son! [NAM] Brothers and sisters, keep your strength. I have not forgotten you. [BOY VILLAGER panting] Big brother I am so thirsty. Not a single drop is left for us. Even the carrots are too thirsty to survive. The sun takes us all. The rain season will come in two months. We'll buy water from the city to last us until then. Nam, this drought has lasted long and we have spent all the savings we have. The crops have failed and there is nothing to buy the water with. Then I must enter the upcoming Tournament. There is a reward and with it I can buy enough water for us all to live. It is the only choice we have. [NAM] The only choice... [NAM grunting] Ahh. This man has spirit. Now everybody get ready! It's time for the next great match! [GOKU] Master? [KRILLIN] Hello? Come on boys, I'm in the middle of my speech here. [CROWD cheering] [ANNOUNCER] I've got to admit I've been waiting for this one, folks! It's young against old! Yamcha vs Jackie Chun! Well, here I go! Good luck, Yamcha! That was a super kick, Krillin. Oh! Thank you very much, mister! [CHUN giggles] There's something funny about that guy... He's so wasteful. [GOKU] I'm so hungry! [KRILLIN] But you just ate! Gosh! [GOKU] Oh wow! [GIRAN] Huh? [GOKU] Now this is more like it! Well, dig in! [GOKU] Oh yeah! I was really starving! Nam, the last of our valuables have been gathered in this bag, so you can sell them in the city to pay for your trip. [stomach growls] Huh? [stomach growling] [NAM] Uh... [GOKU giggles] [GIRAN gasps growls] I know that you're hungry! Eat up! No... I can't. [GOKU yelps] What was that for? You took my food! No one does that! [KRILLIN yelps] Stop your wasting! I'd like to see you try and stop me Mister Skin-and-Bones! [ANNOUNCER] And here are the fighters! In the orange and green uniform, the young and fearless, Yamcha! Bring it home, Wolf-boy! It's what you've always wanted, Yamcha! Enjoy it! I wonder what this mysterious Jackie Chun guy looks like. What's it to you, Bulma? I thought Yamcha was your boyfriend! He is! But I can still keep my eyes open for an upgrade! And in the black and white outfit-- Jackie Chun! Peace, dude! Dude? Has that guy been stuck on a desert island? Well, so much for intrigue! That guy's just a crusty old geezer! Go Yamcha! Hurray! [YAMCHA] Jackie Chun... I've never heard of a fighter by that name. But if he's made it this far, I bet he's got some good moves. Gentlemen, take your positions! Let's go! [YAMCHA] He doesn't even put up his guard. And I can't sense his fighting energy. That means he's either foolish, or extremely confident. [YAMCHA] Wait, I remember now. [CHUN yells] [CHUN laughing] [YAMCHA] But what was his technique? I'll attack him quickly and watch him move. [YAMCHA yells] [YAMCHA grunting] [YAMCHA gasps] That time you almost touched me! Huh? But he's a geezer! Your fighting moves are big and fun to look at, but I'm afraid most of them are just a waste of energy. I'll show you! [YAMCHA yells] [YAMCHA grunting] You have to see this, Krillin! That old man is dodging every punch like it's nothing! [KRILLIN] Hm? [ANNOUNCER] Unbelievable! Yamcha has launched an aggressive attack, but can't even lay a finger on Jackie Chun! Who knew the elderly could move so fast? The old man's just having fun with me! But let's see him laugh at my Wolf Fang Fist! Goku, you know Yamcha, right? Would you say he's a pretty decent fighter? [GOKU] Yeah, he's really good! I fought him once and he used some crazy attack move on me! [KRILLIN] Then if he can't touch this Jackie Chun guy, I think we're in trouble. To be honest, I don't feel too good about this. There's no need to worry. Yamcha still hasn't used his Wolf Fang Fist. I'm still worried. Wolf Fang Fist Attack! [YAMCHA grunting] [CHUN grunts] [YAMCHA] [CHUN grunts] [KRILLIN, GOKU gasp] [GROUP gasps] [YAMCHA] Huh? [YAMCHA screams] Allow me to present you with this refreshing winter breeze. [CHUN grunts] [YAMCHA screams] [BULMA screams] [GOKU screams] [KRILLIN gasps] [CHUN chuckling] How did you like it? Wasn't it cool? That was a joke. [ANNOUNCER] Why-Why that's a ring out! Jackie Chun is the winner! [CROWD cheers] [ANNOUNCER] What an amazing fighter! Jackie Chun seemed to have that victory under his belt from the first hit of the gong! Am I right? I don't get it! How did he--? But he never even touched me! Ah! Yamcha lost! Yeah. And who's gonna have to fight against the old man in the second round? It's me, isn't it? Uh, Uh-huh. Don't worry Krillin, maybe that old guy just got lucky when he beat Yamcha. First it was that sewer-face and now I'm up against a super-hero... [GOKU giggles] Yam-- [KRILLIN] Hey. He might not be in the mood to talk right now, Goku. Oh... That last move... I couldn't... even see it. It's energy from within. Maybe someday I'll teach you how to do it. Say, don't I know you from some-- [ANNOUNCER] This next match should be a doozy, folks! Both these challengers are new to the fighting scene, and I really have no idea what to expect-- It's Nam versus Ranfan! [RANFAN chuckles] [CHUN moans] Excuse me, boys. Oh, Ranfan! Did you see me win? I was very studly! [YAMCHA] Hm... Goku, where's Master Roshi? Have you seen him? He's in the crowd. Puar told us that he's looking at girls. So he's not watching you fight? Guess not. But Puar could be wrong. Goku smelled him! Oh, really? Interesting... [YAMCHA] Something fishy is going on. Man, I wish I were smarter! [CHUN] Hm? [CHUN] This young man's brain is just sweating out seriousness! All this time, and he hasn't smiled once! [CHUN] Everyone else here is fighting for fun, or for the title at most, but not this guy. There's something more to him. Meh. [BOY VILLAGER panting] Nam... So you can sell them in the city. [BOY VILLAGER] Goodbye big brother. Goodbye... [CHUN] Hm... [CHUN] Perhaps my plans will have to change, after all. [YAMCHA] I've got it! Jackie Chun and Master Roshi must be related! [CROWD cheers] [ANNOUNCER] Fighting in the orange and fuscia robe, the ever-silent, Nam! [ANNOUNCER] And to my left, wearing the blue tank top and green pants, is Ranfan! Be gentle! [ANNOUNCER] Let the third match of the tournament... ...begin! [NAM] Oh-- hm. [RANFAN grunting] [NAM groaning] [RANFAN, NAM grunting] [NAM growls] [NAM yells] [RANFAN screams] Hm? [RANFAN whimpers] [RANFAN screams] It hurts! [ANNOUNCER] What's this? It seems Ranfan has collapsed in pain! [RANFAN sobbing] Oh! You hit too hard! Uh... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to! Good one Nam! Go on and make the nice girl cry why don't you! [YAMCHA] He could be his brother... [NAM] Uh, oh, I-I'm so sorry-- [RANFAN sobbing] [NAM stammering] [RANFAN cackles] [RANFAN yells] [NAM groans] [NAM screams] [RANFAN chuckles] [NAM panting, groaning] [RANFAN grunting] [NAM grunts] Huh? I was warned that people in the city would try to trick me from my goal. [RANFAN gulps] But I swore that I wouldn't let anything stand in the way from saving the lives of my people! [ANNOUNCER] Uh-oh! Nam's temper is rising! I'd say he's preparing for a big attack! Ooooh... You're so brave! Don't you make a mockery of me! [RANFAN yelps] [RANFAN grunting] [NAM grunts] [RANFAN growls] [NAM grunts] [RANFAN panting] Just one question... Oh? [NAM gasps] [CHUN yells] [NAM whimpers] You think pink's a good color on me? [NAM whimpers] [RANFAN chuckles] You tough boys are all alike. Oh baby! How fresh! How beautiful! How scantily clad! Uh?! It's that vulgar laughter! I'd recognize it anywhere! [CHUN] Go on Ranfan! Give him the full treatment! [YAMCHA] Jackie Chun isn't Master Roshi's friend, or student, or even his brother! He can only be... Master Roshi himself! It's no wonder I was beaten! [CHUN] Now let's see a good high-kick! Oh yeah! Nam! [NAM whimpers] [CHUN laughs] [RANFAN giggling] [NAM whimpering] [CHUN laughing] I guess it's a good thing I didn't get matched up with her after all! [NAM whimpers] [GOKU] Why does he keep backing away from her, Krillin? It's like when you're tired but you can't sleep. [RANFAN] What's the matter, Nam? Don't you like what you see? [NAM yelping] [ANNOUNCER] What a development! Ranfan's undressing has just been a ploy to force Nam out of the ring! And I do believe it's going to work! [RANFAN] Hm? Ee... Hey! Why aren't you fighting? The village... How much longer can we hold on? Nam, you mustn't hold anything back, because if your mission fails this village will have nothing left. [BOY VILLAGER panting] Big brother, I'm so thirsty! [NAM] I promised I would not let them down! [RANFAN] This act is getting old. [ANNOUNCER] Here it is people! Ranfan is making her final move! [NAM] Wait! All I must do is close my eyes... ...and fight her with my other senses! [RANFAN grunting] [NAM grunts] Huh? [NAM yells] [RANFAN yelps] No way! Huh? [CROWD cheering] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10! And that's an official knock out, people! Nam brings home the win! [RANFAN whimpers] I only meant to stun her. [CROWD gasping] [CHUN] Please step back everyone! I'm a doctor! Okay, let me just... ...check for a heartbeat. [ANNOUNCER] Excuse me, sir,? I think you should go wait inside. [ANNOUNCER coughs] Sir? Oh yeah, that is definitely Master Roshi. [NARRATOR] The World Martial Arts Tournament continues to heat up! And next on the list-- the monster beast, Giran vs Goku! On Dragon Ball!
