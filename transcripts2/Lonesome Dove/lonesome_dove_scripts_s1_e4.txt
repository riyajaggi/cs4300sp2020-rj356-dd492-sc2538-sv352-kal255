 Still on the trail, the men face ever increasing danger. They have an 80 mile stretch without water and the weather has turned with the onset of winter. Joshua Deets' encounter with a group of young Indians leads to tragedy. Similarly, Gus is severely wounded in an encounter with Indian warriors. He is rescued by mountain man but has to have his right leg amputated. By the time Call catches up with him, it's too late as Gus refused to let the doctor amputate his other infected leg. His dying wish is to be buried in Texas and Call promises to take him home. Newt knows that Call is his father but that's something Call has never acknowledged. He does began to test the boy and leaves him in charge after he proves his mettle. In the spring, Call begins his 3,000 mile journey home, keeping his promise to his friend.

 I THINK OLD DEETS KNOWED HIS TIME WAS UP. HE STOOD THERE AND LET THAT BOY KILL HIM. WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE? HE WAS JUST HOLDING THAT BABY. HE COULD'VE DROPPED IT BUT DIDN'T. HE JUST STOOD THERE. I'VE SEEN YOUR FATHER BURY MANY A MAN, BUT I'VE NEVER KNOWN HIM TO CARVE A SIGN BEFORE. LET'S SEE WHAT HE WROTE. WHAT'S IT READ, GUS? IT SAYS, "JOSH DEETS...

 "SERVED WITH ME 30 YEARS, "FOUGHT IN 21 ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE COMANCHE AND THE KIOWA." "CHEERFUL IN ALL WEATHERS... " "NEVER SHIRKED A TASK." "SPLENDID BEHAVIOR." THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS. MY LORD... OLD DEETS IS GONE. MY LORD. WE OUGHT TO LET THEM PIGS RIDE IN THE WAGON. PIGS RIDE IN THE WAGON? I NEVER HEARD SUCH A THING. THEY MADE HISTORY, THE FIRST PIGS TO WALK

 FROM TEXAS TO MONTANA. THAT'S QUITE A FEAT. WHAT'S IT GOT THEM? A BEAR WILL PROBABLY EAT THEM, OR WE WILL THIS WINTERTIME. THEM RABBITS AND DUCKS YOU GOT THERE WILL MAKE A FINE MEAL, PEA EYE. SEEN SOME ELK, TOO. YOU SEEN ANY INDIANS? NARY A ONE. YOU PROBABLY WON'T, NEITHER. NOT UNTIL THEY- LIFT YOUR SCALP. OLD JAKE WAS RIGHT. I NEVER SEEN A PRETTIER COUNTRY THAN THIS. GUS, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE SO FAR. THERE AIN'T NOTHING BETTER THAN RIDING A FINE HORSE INTO A NEW COUNTRY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT ME AND WOODROW WAS MEANT FOR, THOUGH DON'T TELL YOUR PA I SAID THAT. I KEEP HIM THINKING HE'S A PECK OF TROUBLE, SO HE DON'T GET SASSY. HE AIN'T MENTIONED IT. WHAT? THAT HE'S MY PA. IT WOULDN'T BE HIS WAY TO MENTION IT. SEE, WOODROW AIN'T MUCH OF A MENTIONER. GUS, IS IT THAT HE DON'T LIKE ME? NO, HE JUST DON'T WANT TO ADMIT HE'S HUMAN LIKE THE REST OF US, THAT'S ALL. HE AIN'T HUMAN LIKE THE REST OF US. HE HAD A CHANCE ONCE WITH YOUR MAMA, BUT HE TURNED HIS BACK AND HE WON'T ADMIT HIS MISTAKE. THAT'S WHY HE'S NEVER ADMITTED HE'S YOUR PA, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE ADMITTING THAT HE'S HUMAN, AND HE AIN'T NEVER GOING TO ADMIT THAT, NOT TO YOU, ME, NOT EVEN TO HIMSELF. I'M GLAD YOU TOLD ME. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THE INFORMATION, BUT THERE IT IS. WELL, JUST KNOWING MEANS SOMETHING, I GUESS. SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE GRAVE DIGGING IS ALL WE DO AROUND HERE, DON'T IT, CHOLO? WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN WE DIE? HMM, NOT TOO MUCH. YOU ARE JUST DEAD. MAYBE IT'S NOT AS BIG A CHANGE AS WE THINK. MAYBE YOU JUST GO BACK TO WHERE YOU LIVED OR NEAR YOUR FAMILY OR WHEREVER YOU WAS HAPPIEST. ONLY YOU'RE JUST A SPIRIT NOW, AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE TROUBLES THAT THE LIVING HAVE. I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE SO. WELL... WHAT YOU DOING WITH THOSE LARD CANS, JASPER? MAKING FLOATS FOR WHEN WE HIT THAT YELLOWSTONE. FLOATS? I AIN'T GOING TO DROWN IN THAT LAST RIVER. WHO SAYS THE YELLOWSTONE IS LAST? THE MISSOURI'S UP THERE AND THEN THE MILK. I'M ONLY CROSSING ONE MORE RIVER. YOU'LL CROSS 40 IF CAPTAIN SAYS. WHY DO WE KEEP GOING? AIN'T WE TRAVELED ENOUGH? I'D LIKE A TOWN, MYSELF. IT DON'T HAVE TO BE ST. LOUIS, LONG AS IT HAS A SALOON. I'D LIKE TO SEE MY HOME AGAIN WHILE THE FOLKS ARE STILL ALIVE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE HIRED FOR LIFE. WE'LL PROBABLY ALL BE BEAR CRAP IN A WEEK ANYHOW. WELL, I DON'T THINK THAT'S FUNNY. READY? GUS, HOW LONG YOU FIGURE IT'LL TAKE YOU TO SCOUT YELLOWSTONE? A COUPLE OF DAYS, PROBABLY, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO LONG, GIRLS. DON'T LET THE INDIANS GET YOU WHILE WE'RE GONE. YOU ALWAYS GOT TO JOKE, DON'T YOU? WHO'S JOKING? PRETTY, AIN'T THEY? I RECKON. LET'S CHASE THEM. YOU WANT TO? SHOOT US ONE FOR OUR SUPPER? NO, I MEAN CHASE THEM JUST FOR THE SPORT OF IT. WHAT, TO RUN THEM OFF? YOU DON'T GET THE POINT. CHASE THEM, BECAUSE BEFORE LONG, THERE WON'T BE ANY BUFFALO LEFT TO CHASE. THEM BULLS WILL HOOK YOU. YEAH. DO YOU REMEMBER OLD MAN BARLOW? THAT BUFFALO HOOKED HIM BAD. OLD MAN BARLOW WAS A SLOW THINKER, KIND OF LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE I COULD NAME. WELL, HE WAS A SLOW WALKER, TOO, WHEN THAT BUFFALO GOT THROUGH WITH HIM. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO HIM? HE MARRIED A FAT WIDOW AND HAD A PASSEL OF KIDS. YOU COULD'VE DONE THAT, SINCE YOU DON'T WANT TO CHASE BUFFALO. I WOULDN'T WANT TO CHASE BUFFALO EVEN IF I WAS MARRIED. FORGET I EVEN MENTIONED IT. WELL, I LIKE BEING A BACHELOR, GUS. THAT'S GOOD, PEA EYE. I'M SURE IT'S ALL PART OF GOD'S PLAN THAT YOU ARE ONE. HA HA HA! YOU ALL RIGHT? HELL, NO, I AIN'T ALL RIGHT! UGH! I'M HIT! HEAD FOR THAT CREEK DOWN THERE! AAH! HOW MANY MORE YOU KILL? NOT BUT ONE. TWO. THEY'RE GOING TO SURROUND US. I GUESS WE WON'T HEAR FROM THEM TILL DARK NOW. HOW IS YOUR SHOULDER? WELL, IT WENT CLEAN THROUGH. I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF WAITING AROUND TILL DARK. PEA... PULL THEM OUT FOR ME, WOULD YOU? OH, WAIT, PEA. JEEZ! JESUS! WHEW. ALL RIGHT, THE OTHER ONE. IT'S IN THERE DEEP. WELL, PULL HARDER. 'I GOD! OH, LORD! IT WON'T BUDGE NARY AN INCH, GUS. WELL... PUSH IT ON THROUGH THEN. GO AHEAD, PEA, DO IT NOW. GO ON. UH-HUH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH. WHEW. WHEW. IT WON'T GO THROUGH. HERE... CUT IT. CUT THE SKIN. COME ON. OH, LORD. AAH! THEY'RE KILLING OUR HORSES. THIS WILL HAVE TO DO FOR NOW, PEA. WHAT INDIANS IS IT WE'RE FIGHTING ANYHOW? WELL, THEY DIDN'T INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. MAYBE THEY GIVE UP. YEAH? THEY'RE TRYING TO GET LUCKY. WHEW. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DIDN'T STAY IN TEXAS. WE PRETTY NEAR HAD THE INDIANS WHIPPED DOWN THERE. THIS IS A BAD PIECE OF LUCK WE'RE HAVING, RUNNING INTO THIS LITTLE BUNCH OF FIGHTERS. DO YOU RECKON WE CAN HOLD THEM OFF TILL THE CAPTAIN COMES? WELL, HE WON'T MISS US FOR A WEEK. I DON'T FANCY SQUATTING IN THE DIRT THAT LONG. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO FOR HELP ONCE IT GETS DARK. GO FOR HELP? WELL, THEY MIGHT CATCH ME. THEN WHAT? WELL... THEY'LL PROBABLY START BY CUTTING YOUR COJONES OFF. SHH, LISTEN. AAH! AAH! AAH-AAH-AAH! AAH-AAH! AAH! AAH-AAH-AAH! AAH-AAH! MAYBE I SPOOKED THEM A LITTLE BIT. THEY PROBABLY NEVER HEARD COMANCHE BEFORE. YOU, TOO. OH... JEEZ. IT'S GOING TO BE NIGHT SHORTLY. YEAH. THEY'RE GOING TO TRY SNEAKING UP ON US IN THE DARK, AIN'T THEY, GUS? BE TAKING A CHANCE IF THEY DO, A COUPLE OF SHARPSHOOTERS LIKE US. I AIN'T NO SHARPSHOOTER. I USUALLY MISS IF I AIN'T GOT TIME TO TAKE CAREFUL AIM. 'I GOD, BUT IT'S... DEPRESSING TO TALK TO YOU, PEA. YOU SMELL SOMETHING? YEAH... RAIN. YOU FEELING POORLY, GUS? YEAH. I'M-I'M STARTING TO GET THE CHILLS, I AM. FOUR HOURS AGO, A FROG COULD HAVE WADED ACROSS THAT CREEK. NOW LOOK AT IT. IT MIGHT GIVE US THE CHANCE WE NEED. FLOAT RIGHT BY THEM. GET ON BACK TO THE HERD FOR HELP. I AIN'T GOING TO LEAVE YOU. OH... WELL... NOT LIKE THIS. I CAN'T WALK, AND YOU CAN'T CARRY ME. IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE. OHH... YOU RECKON... YOU CAN HOLD OUT A SPELL? WELL, I'VE GOT A DAY OR TWO LEFT IN ME, I BELIEVE. NOW, YOU BETTER GET STARTED. NOW... TELL WOODROW... TO COME A- RUNNIN'. I WILL.

I FEAR YOU'VE A FEW FRACTUOSITIES YET TO ENDURE. A FEW WHAT? GOT TO TAKE THAT OTHER LEG OFF. SHOULD HAVE DONE IT WHILE YOU WERE UNCONSCIOUS. BUT THE FACT IS, THIS ONE EXHAUSTED ME. IF YOU'D HACKED THEM BOTH OFF, I'D HAVE SHOT YOU DEAD. WELL, I CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR ATTACHMENT TO YOUR OWN APPENDAGES, SIR. BUT THE FACT OF IT IS, YOU'LL DIE IF WE DON'T TAKE IT OFF.

HE WANTS TO LAY IN THAT LITTLE PICNIC SPOT YOU AND HIM HAD IN TEXAS. I REMEMBER THAT SPOT. WE QUARRELED THERE. HE WANTED WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE, AND I WANTED WHAT HE DIDN'T HAVE. WELL, HE FELT TENDER ABOUT THE PLACE, AND I GAVE HIM MY WORD. NOW, HE WROTE YOU A LETTER. HE WROTE YOU EACH A LETTER. HE LEFT YOU HIS HALF OF THE HERD, TOO.

FOR THAT GIRL'S SAKE, I WISH YOU'D BURY HIM HERE. GUS MEANT THE WORLD TO HER. I AGREE IT'S FOOLISH. I TOLD HIM SO MYSELF, BUT I GIVE HIM MY WORD. GIVE HIM YOUR WORD? YOU GIVE THAT BOY YOUR NAME BEFORE YOU LEFT MONTANA? GIVE HIM MY HORSE. YOU GAVE HIM YOUR HORSE AND NOT YOUR NAME. I PUT A LOT MORE VALUE ON THE ANIMAL THAN I DO MY NAME. LOOK AT ME, CAPTAIN CALL. I'M SORRY YOU AND GUS McCRAE EVER MET. YOU RUINED EACH OTHER AND THOSE CLOSEST TO YOU. I LOVED GUS, BUT I WOULDN'T FIGHT YOU FOR HIM EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE.

YOU'RE CAPTAIN CALL. THIS HERE IS YOUR FRIEND. YOU STILL GOT A LONG WAY TO GO, HUH? CAN YOU FIX THE WAGON? WHY, SURE. LET ME LOOK AT IT. LOOKS LIKE WE MAY HAVE TO REPLACE THE WHEEL. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TOWN... TO WATCH A HANGING. YEAH... EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THIS ONE HANG. HE MUY MALO- BAD. WHO IS IT, SOME POLITICIAN? NO, IT'S A MAN CAUGHT BUTCHERING A FAMILY DOWN IN BOSQUE REDONDO. THEY GOT HIM UP THERE. HIS NAME IS BLUE DUCK. I HEAR HE CAUSED CONSIDERABLE TROUBLE DOWN IN YOUR COUNTRY, CAPTAIN. THAT'S TRUE, HE DID. WELL... THEM DAYS IS OVER FOR HIM NOW. WHAT'S HE BEEN DOING? NOTHING, JUST SITTING THERE. I HEAR YOU'RE BRINGING YOUR STINKIN' OLD FRIEND TO MY HANGIN'. HE'D ENJOY SEEING IT, ALL RIGHT. I SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT HIM AND COOKED HIM. I'D A KILLED YOU FOR IT IF YOU HAD. I RAPED WOMEN, STOLE CHILDREN, AND BURNED HOUSES, SHOT MEN, RUN OFF HORSES, AND KILLED CATTLE, AND ROBBED WHO I PLEASED ALL OVER YOUR TERRITORY, AND YOU NEVER EVEN HAD A GOOD LOOK AT ME UNTIL TODAY. YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED ME. IT DON'T MATTER MUCH NOW, THOUGH... DOES IT? YOU RANGERS! I EXPECT I'LL KILL A PASSEL OF YOU YET. I DOUBT IT. NOT UNLESS YOU CAN SPROUT WINGS AND FLY THROUGH THE HANGMAN'S NOOSE. I CAN FLY. AN OLD WOMAN TAUGHT ME. IF YOU CARE TO WAIT... YOU'LL SEE ME. I'LL WAIT. I GIVE YOU MY WORD ON IT. YOUR HANGMAN'S WAITING. ARE YOU READY? UGH. AAH! AAH! AAH! AAH! WELL... I GUESS THAT OLD WOMAN DIDN'T TEACH YOU HOW TO FLY AFTER ALL. HHHYAH! YAH! YAH! AAH! WELL, THERE YOU ARE... AUGUSTUS. I GUESS THIS WILL TEACH ME TO BE MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT I PROMISE IN THE FUTURE. BOL. CAPITAN? HOW ARE YOU, BOL? CAPITAN... CAPITAN! I'M SURPRISED TO SEE YOU HERE. THOUGHT YOU WENT BACK TO MEXICO TO BE WITH YOUR FAMILY. I DID GO, BUT MY DAUGHTERS, THEY WERE ALL MARRIED AND GONE... AND MY WIFE... SHE WAS HARDER TO GET ALONG WITH THAN EVER... SO I CAME BACK. WHERE ARE ALL THE OTHERS? JAKE'S BURIED UP IN KANSAS... DEETS... IN MONTANA... GUS IS IN A LITTLE STAND OF PECAN TREES ALONGSIDE A CREEK WHERE HE USED TO PICNIC WITH A WOMAN. THE REST OF THE BOYS ARE UP IN NORTH COUNTRY... BUILDING A RANCH. THEY SAY IT BURNED DOWN ABOUT A YEAR AGO. ARE YOU CAPTAIN CALL... CAPTAIN WOODROW F. CALL? WHAT STARTED THE FIRE? I HEARD THAT THE OWNER- A MAN NAMED WANZ, I BELIEVE... XAVIER WANZ. HE WAS APPARENTLY IN LOVE WITH SOME WHORE, BUT SHE LEFT HIM, SO HE LOCKED HIMSELF IN HER ROOM AND BURNED THE PLACE DOWN. THEY SAY HE MISSED HER. I SWEAR. YOU ARE CAPTAIN CALL, AREN'T YOU? WHAT DO YOU WANT? I WORK FOR THE NEWSPAPER UP IN SAN ANTONIO. I WONDER IF I COULD TALK TO YOU FOR A FEW MINUTES? NO.
