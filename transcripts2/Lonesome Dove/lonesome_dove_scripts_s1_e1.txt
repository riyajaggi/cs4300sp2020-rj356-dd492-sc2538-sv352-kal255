THERE AIN'T NO INDIANS ANYMORE. WE CLEANED THEM OUT. HOW ABOUT BLUE DUCK? YOU NEVER GOT HIM. NO, WE NEVER GOT THAT HALF-BREED. BLUE DUCK AIN'T AROUND HERE NOWHERE. HIS RANGE IS FURTHER NORTH. HOW COME THE CAPTAIN GOES TO THE RIVER? HE JUST MISSES THE WILD OLD DAYS WHEN HE HAD SOMEBODY TO OUTWIT, THAT'S ALL. I'LL WHACK THAT BELL IF I WANT TO. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THAT KNIFE, BOL?

THE ONLY EDUCATION HE'S GOT IS LISTENING TO ME. WHAT KIND OF EDUCATION IS THAT? YOU THINK HE'LL LEARN MORE SHOVELING HORSE POOP FOR YOU? I SHOVEL MY SHARE. IT AIN'T HURT ME. FINE, IF THAT'S HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR FORTUNE. I THINK I'LL STRAGGLE DOWN TO THAT GIN PALACE AND SEE IF I CAN'T SCARE UP A CARD GAME. NOW, YOU PIGS... YOU DON'T WAIT UP FOR ME, NOW.

IT'LL TAKE A HACKSAW TO CUT THEM EGGS, THE WAY YOU'RE FRYING THEM IN COFFEE GROUNDS, BOL. I DON'T CARE. PEA EYE, IT'S BAD MANNERS TO GO RELIEVING YOURSELF WHERE PEOPLE ARE EATING BREAKFAST. WHAT WOULD YOUR MAMA THINK? GOOD MORNING. MORNING, DISH. HAVE SOME BACON. THANKS, CAPTAIN. YOU CAN WORK IT OFF. WORK IT OFF? HEY, COME LOOK WHO'S RIDING UP THE ROAD. IT OUGHT TO BE DEETS. HE'S DUE BACK FROM SAN ANTONE. IT'S DEETS, BUT NOT ALONE. THAT'S DEETS ALL RIGHT. WHO'S THE OTHER ONE? 'I GOD, WOODROW, THAT'S JAKE SPOON! DANGED IF YOU AIN'T RIGHT. LORD, HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN? 10 YEARS. WELL, HOWDY, BOYS. WHAT'S FOR BREAKFAST? YOU'RE TOO LATE. WE ATE. YOU ALWAYS WAS A HOG, GUS. CAPTAIN. GOOD TO SEE YOU. WHERE YOU BEEN ALL THESE YEARS? ARKANSAS MOST RECENTLY. YOUR HORSE LOOKS LIKE YOU LEFT IN A HURRY. YEAH, THAT'S TRUE ENOUGH. WHAT'S YOU THINK, CAPTAIN? DIDN'T I FIND THE PRODIGAL? YOU DID, BUT I BET IT WASN'T IN NO CHURCH. PEA, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME. THANK YOU, JAKE. THIS IS DISH BOGGETT. HE JUST SIGNED ON. I DID? AND WHO'S THIS? DON'T YOU REMEMBER ME, JAKE? YOU USED TO BUY ME HARD CANDY. YOU GAVE ME MY FIRST RIDE ON HORSEBACK. MY GOD! WELL, IF IT AIN'T NEWT! LITTLE NEWT! I GROWED UP, HUH? YOU GROWED UP GOOD, NEWT. THANK YOU, JAKE. WOODROW MAKES SURE HE SLEEPS PLENTY. DEETS, GIVE HIS HORSE A GOOD FEED. I JUDGE BEEN A WHILE SINCE HE'S HAD ONE. DIDN'T DEETS HAVE THAT SAME CAP BEFORE I LEFT? DEETS WOULDN'T QUIT A GARMENT 'CAUSE OF A LITTLE AGE. WE CAN'T ALL BE FINE DRESSERS LIKE YOU. PEA, YOU BEST GET THESE TWO BOYS TO WORK DIGGING THAT WELL. WELL, NOW, CAPTAIN, I- YOU DON'T MIND DOING A LITTLE WELL DIGGING TO PAY FOR BREAKFAST, DO YOU, DISH? I DON'T GUESS SO. THAT OLD PISTOLERO YOU GOT FOR A COOK HAS BEEN CLEANING HIS GUN ON THIS TOWEL. THERE'S WORSE HE WIPES ON IT. WHERE YOU BEEN ALL THESE YEARS, JAKE? SEEING THE COUNTRY. I WAS UP IN MONTANA TWO YEARS AGO. PRETTIER LAND THERE NEVER WAS, 'SPECIALLY ON MILK RIVER. YOU CAN SMELL CANADY FROM THERE. BET YOU CAN SMELL INDIANS, TOO. YEAH, BUT IT'S WORTH IT SEEING ALL THE GRASS. GRASS EVERYWHERE. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT. PLENTY OF WATER, TOO. I'D GO TODAY, IF I COULD SPROUT WINGS AND FLY. BE SAFER TO WALK. GIVE SOMEBODY ELSE TIME TO LICK THE INDIANS. THE MINUTE THEY ARE LICKED, THERE'S GOING TO BE FORTUNES MADE IN MONTANA. WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, JAKE? I'M SAYING LET'S US GET TO IT FIRST. ROUND UP FREE CATTLE HERE, DRIVE THEM UP. WE'D BE RICH. LAND LIKE YOU NEVER SEEN. WE AIN'T SEEN YOU IN 10 YEARS. NOW YOU WANT US TO PACK UP, GO NORTH, AND GET SCALPED. YOU WERE NEVER AFRAID OF A FEW INDIANS. WE WHUPPED THEM DOWN HERE, AND THEY WAS COMANCHES. YOU WERE NEVER A LOVER OF COWS, NEITHER. PRETTY WHORES, CARDS, AND CLEAN SHIRTS WAS MORE YOUR LINE. YEAH, BUT I CAN SMELL AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN IT'S UNDER MY NOSE. WHAT ABOUT THAT TROUBLE IN ARKANSAS? MULE SKINNER THREW DOWN ON ME IN A SALOON. SHOT BACK AT HIM AND KILLED A DENTIST. WAS A PURE ACCIDENT, BUT I KILLED HIM. HE STOOD IN THE WRONG PLACE? ACTUALLY, HE WAS OUTSIDE WALKING DOWN THE STREET. THE PLANK WALL WON'T STOP NO.50-CALIBER BULLET. BUT A DENTIST WILL. DROPPED HIM DEAD. IT WAS BAD LUCK ALL AROUND. NOBODY LIKES A DENTIST ANYWAY. THIS ONE WAS THE MAYOR. WORSE YET, HIS BROTHER'S THE SHERIFF. YOUNG FELLOW NAMED JULY JOHNSON. HE WAS AWAY AT THE TIME. THEY WOULDN'T HANG YOU FOR AN ACCIDENT, NOT EVEN IN ARKANSAS. SINCE THEY DON'T TAKE MUCH SHINE TO GAMBLERS, I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE THEM THE OPTION. GOOD TO SEE YOU BOYS. I HARDLY THOUGHT TO FIND YOU STILL HERE. AIN'T NOTHING CHANGED MUCH AROUND HERE SINCE YOU LEFT, JAKE. LITTLE NEWT SURE SURPRISED ME. GUESS I THOUGHT HE WAS STILL JUST A SPUD. WHAT ABOUT MAGGIE? MAGGIE'S BEEN DEAD NINE YEARS, JAKE. NINE YEARS. I SWEAR... YOU'VE HAD LITTLE NEWT ALL THIS TIME. WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE SCRAMBLING TO ADOPT A DEAD WHORE'S CHILD. AIN'T THAT RIGHT, WOODROW? WELL, IT AIN'T A HOLIDAY. LET'S HELP THEM BOYS OUT THERE. I SWEAR. IT WAS ONLY THE CHRISTIAN THING TO DO- TAKING HIM IN, I MEAN. ONE OF YOU BOYS IS MOST LIKELY HIS DAD. JULY, GET OUT HERE. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU. HELLO, PEACH. WHERE DID YOU GET THE ROOSTER, PEACH? IT'S MY ROOSTER. JULY, WHEN DO YOU AIM TO START AFTER JAKE SPOON? WELL- HE'LL GET OVER TO MEXICO OR SOMEWHERE YOU SIT AROUND HERE MUCH LONGER... LIKE YOU BEEN DOING. THE THING IS, PEACH... I MEAN EVERYBODY PRETTY MUCH AGREES IT WAS AN ACCIDENT. STOP THAT, ROOSTER! BENNY WAS MY HUSBAND AND YOUR BROTHER AND THE MAYOR OF THIS TOWN. NOW THAT OUGHT TO STAND FOR SOMETHING, JULY. IT DOES- YOU'RE THE SHERIFF, AIN'T YOU? IT'S WHAT YOU'RE PAID FOR. WELL, THAT'S TRUE, BUT YOU CAN'T- YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE MARRIED THAT WOMAN, JULY. REMEMBER I WARNED YOU ABOUT THAT? WELL, WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO WITH THIS, PEACH? I THINK YOU'D RATHER STAY HOME THAN DO YOUR DUTY. THAT'S WHAT I THINK. I NEVER SAID I WASN'T GOING AFTER HIM. OH, ROOSTER! GUESS THAT WILL TEACH HIM TO PECK ME. WELL, JULY... WHAT ABOUT JAKE SPOON? I EXPECT TO FIND HIM DOWN AROUND SAN ANTONIO SOMEWHERE, PEACH. I HEAR HE HAS FRIENDS THERE. YOU CATCH HIM, YOU HEAR ME? I WILL, PEACH. DON'T WORRY. NOW LET'S SEE HOW YOU LIKE THE COOK POT. THEM FRIENDS OF JAKE SPOON'S- THEY'RE TWO OF THE MOST FAMOUS TEXAS RANGERS THAT EVER LIVED. YOU KNOW THAT? I DON'T SUPPOSE THERE'S A SPORTING WOMAN AROUND. ARE YOU SO RICH THAT'S ALL YOU THINK ABOUT? I THINK ABOUT IT, RICH OR POOR. GET FROM HERE, YOU PIGS. GO HUNT YOU UP ANOTHER SNAKE OR SOMETHING. GET! SIT DOWN, JAKE. LET'S TALK. FOLKS THAT KEEP PIGS AIN'T NO BETTER THAN FARMERS. I'M SURPRISED AT YOU AND CALL. I FIGURED YOU'D AT LEAST STAY CATTLEMEN AFTER WE QUIT RANGERING. I THOUGHT YOU'D OWN A RAILROAD BY NOW OR AT LEAST A WHOREHOUSE. I GUESS LIFE'S DISAPPOINTED US BOTH. I MAY NOT HAVE MADE NO FORTUNE, BUT I NEVER SPOKE TO A PIG, NEITHER. IN ALL YOUR WORLD TRAVELS, JAKE, YOU DIDN'T RUN ACROSS CLARA NOWHERE DID YOU? SHE'S STILL MARRIED TO THAT HORSE TRADER BOB ALLEN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. YOU SAW HER THEN? JUST FOR A MINUTE OUTSIDE A STORE IN OGALLALA. BOB WAS WITH HER, SO I WASN'T ASKED FOR SUPPER. ANY YOUNG'UNS? TWO GIRLS, I BELIEVE. I HEARD HER BOYS DIED. HOW DID SHE LOOK? NOT AS PRETTY AS SHE ONCE WAS. BUT IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE WE COURTED HER. NEBRASKA, HUH? I WENT BY THERE ON MY WAY TO MONTANA. BOB'S CLOSE TO RICH, DID YOU KNOW THAT? ARMY GETS MOST OF ITS HORSES FROM HIM. FIRST HE GETS CLARA, THEN HE GETS RICH. 'I GOD, IMAGINE THAT. HIM SO DUMB HE COULD HARDLY WALK THROUGH A DOOR WITHOUT BUMPING HIS HEAD. DON'T SEEM FAIR, DOES IT? STOP DIGGING WHEN YOU GET TO CHINA. YOU'LL KNOW WHEN YOU'RE THERE. ALL THE MEN WEAR PIGTAILS. IF YOU HADN'T LOANED ME THAT $2.00, I'D BE HALFWAY TO MATAGORDA BY NOW. NO NEED TO THANK ME. EASY, THERE. WANT SOME HELP? NOT FROM YOU, I DON'T. WHERE'S JAKE? CATCHING A NAP. OH, MAN. HE AIN'T CHANGED A BIT, HAS HE? LOOK WHO'S TALKING. WHEN DID YOU CHANGE LAST? STILL BREAKING HORSES WHEN THERE'S PLENTY OF GENTLE ONES. I NEVER SEEN A MORE INTELLIGENT FILLY. LOOK HOW SHE'S WATCHING. SHE AIN'T WATCHING YOU 'CAUSE SHE LOVES YOU. GUS. WHAT? WHY NOT GO UP TO MONTANA? THE CATTLEMAN'S PARADISE, TO HEAR JAKE TELL IT. SOUNDS LIKE A DAMN WILDERNESS TO ME. AREN'T WE A SHADE OLD TO START FIGHTING INDIANS AGAIN? I MEAN IT, GUS. WHY NOT JUST... GO NORTH WITH THE HERD? I TELL YOU WHAT. YOU RIDE ON UP THERE, CLEAR OUT THE INDIANS, BUILD A LITTLE CABIN, GET A NICE FIRE GOING IN THE FIREPLACE, ME AND JAKE'LL COME UP WITH A HERD. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE HERD YOU TWO COULD GET. HERD OF WHORES, MAYBE. YOU AIN'T NO MORE A CATTLEMAN THAN I AM. YOU KNOW IT, TOO. I WANT TO DO IT, GUS. I WANT TO SEE THAT COUNTRY BEFORE THE BANKERS AND LAWYERS ALL GET IT. HEY, YOU BOYS GOT ANY WATER FLOWING YET? IT'S FLOWING OUT OF ME. I LOST TWO GALLONS ALREADY. WELL, QUIT WORK. CATCH A LITTLE REST. WE'RE GOING TO MEXICO TONIGHT. 'I GOD, WOODROW. WHERE YOU OFF TO, LOOKING SO PRETTY? JUST TAKING A STROLL, SINCE WE GOT THE AFTERNOON OFF. WHAT DO YOU DO IN MEXICO? WE RIDE AROUND IN THE DARK, STRIKE ON SOME HORSES AND COWS, THEN WE STEAL THEM. LIKE THE MEXICANS STOLE THEM FROM OVER HERE. HOORAY. COME ON IN HERE, SON. ANYBODY DIGGING A WELL IN ALL THIS HEAT DESERVES A DRINK. WELL, THAT'S- THANKS, ANYWAY. WELL, LORD, LOOK AT THE CAPTAIN. WHOA HEE HEE! GOING TO RUN HER OUT NOW. GOING TO SHOW WHOSE HORSE SHE IS. EEEE! YOU THINK THE CAPTAIN WILL LET ME GO TONIGHT? YOU'RE SURE IN A HURRY TO GET SHOT AT. ANY MORE HORSE BITES?

I WANT TO GO BY MYSELF, JAKE. DISH? OH, HELLO, CAPTAIN. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? I WISH I COULD SAY. WELL, WHY CAN'T YOU SAY? DON'T BELIEVE I CAN REMEMBER. JAKE, YOU PUT HIM UP TO THIS? NO. I FOUND HIM TRYING TO SEE HOW FAST HE COULD DRAIN A BOTTLE. I'LL NOT HAVE MEN CAN'T DO THEIR JOB. I CAN RIDE, CAPTAIN. AIN'T NOTHING TO SETTING ON A HORSE. BETTER NOT FALL OFF, OR THE MEXICANS WILL GET YOU. YOU MEN WANT SUPPER, BEST GO GET IT. WE'RE LEAVING AT SUNDOWN. NEWT, BEST GO SADDLE YOUR PONY, TOO, I RECKON. IF THAT OLD MEXICAN THINKS IT'S THE 4th OF JULY, I'LL GIVE HIM FIRECRACKERS! THAT WAS A FOOLISH THING TO DO, JAKE. YOU MIGHT HAVE HIT THE HOUSE INSTEAD OF OLD BOLIVAR. NO WONDER YOU'RE ON THE RUN. EVENING, JOE. EVENING. HOW'S YOUR MAMA BEEN TODAY? SHE WAS SICK AGAIN THIS MORNING. DON'T YOU SLOSH THAT MILK, JOE. I'M HOME. SUPPER'S ON THE TABLE. JOE SAID YOU WERE FEELING POORLY AGAIN THIS MORNING. IT'S LIVING IN THIS TOWN THAT DOES IT. YOU WANT SOME BUTTERMILK? NO, SIR. IF HE WANTS BUTTERMILK, HE CAN GET IT HIMSELF. DON'T WAIT ON HIM HAND AND FOOT. I BEEN THINKING. I BETTER GO CATCH JAKE SPOON. DO WHAT? CATCH JAKE SPOON FOR KILLING BENNY. NOW WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT? IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, AS EVERYBODY WITH ANY SENSE KNOWS. I KNOW- PEACH BEEN BULLYING YOU AGAIN, IS THAT IT? WIPE YOUR LIP, JULY. JOE, RUN FETCH A BUCKET OF WATER. WE BEEN MARRIED FIVE MONTHS.

WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD AT THAT, JULY. I THINK I SHOULD. TAKE JOE WITH YOU. TAKE JOE? WELL, HE'S JUST A BOY. THERE COULD BE A FIGHT. I DOUBT ANYBODY'D SHOOT A BOY, EVEN IN TEXAS. I WAS THINKING MAYBE I'D TAKE ROSCOE. TAKE JOE. HE'S GOT TO GROW UP SOMETIME. IT WON'T HURT HIM. I DON'T KNOW, ELLIE. I KNOW. I'LL GO TELL HIM. HERE. BETTER TO HAVE THAT IF IT'S NOT NEEDED THAN TO NEED IT AND NOT HAVE IT. YOU PIGS GUARD THE PLACE WHILE WE'RE GONE. THEY PUT A GUN ON YOU, AIN'T THEY? WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY MAKE YOU BOSS OF THIS OUTFIT. BETTER HOPE NOT, DEETS. I'D CUT YOUR WAGES FOR ALWAYS JOSHING ME. BIG CAMP'S JUST A COUPLE OF MILES OVER THAT RIDGE.

MOST OF THIS CROWD CAN'T NEITHER. DISH IS STILL HALF DRUNK. NEWT AIN'T EVER SPILLED BLOOD. I SWEAR, GUS. YOU'D ARGUE WITH A POSSUM. BE EASIER THAN ARGUING WITH YOU, WOODROW. How many you figure?

IF I'M WRONG, YOU CAN HIT ME BACK. WE CUT CARDS FOR IT. I CAN'T PROVE IT, BUT I KNOW HE CHEATED. SHOULD HAVE WARNED YOU ABOUT CUTTING CARDS WITH THAT OLD CUD. IF IT HAD BEEN ANYBODY BUT HIM, I'D HAVE SHOT YOU. YOU GOING WITH THE HERD? I AIN'T DECIDED. THEY DON'T LEAVE TILL MONDAY. YOU AIN'T PLANNING ON LEAVING ME HERE IF YOU DO GO, ARE YOU, JAKE? ALL OF THEM COWBOYS IN LOVE WITH YOU? I'D HAVE TO KILL HALF OF THEM BEFORE WE GOT TO RED RIVER. THEY WON'T BOTHER ME. GUS IS THE ONLY ONE WITH ENOUGH GUTS TO TRY. YEAH. HE'D WANT TO CUT THE CARDS TWICE A DAY. I'M GOING WITH YOU, JAKE, WHETHER YOU GO ON THE DRIVE OR NOT. I'M GOING WHEN YOU LEAVE. MAYBE WE'LL GO TO SAN ANTONE AND GAMBLE A SPELL. I'VE BEEN. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK. AIN'T YOU THE HARD ONE TO PLEASE? WELL, NO, I AIN'T. I JUST WANT TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO, LIKE YOU PROMISED ME. THAT WOULD PLEASE ME JUST FINE. I AIN'T GOING TO RUN OFF AND LEAVE YOU, LORIE, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK. I KNOW YOU AIN'T, JAKE. MORNING. MORNING. YOU'RE UP AWFUL EARLY. JAKE, LET'S LEAVE TODAY. TODAY?

SEE YOU BOYS ON THE TRAIL SOMEWHERE. LORIE. WOODROW... LET'S GO IF WE'RE GOING. I WAS THINKING OF MAKING ANOTHER RUN TO MEXICO. WE GOT ENOUGH CATTLE TO STOCK FIVE RANCHES. LET'S GO. BOYS, CHECK YOUR GEAR. WE'LL BE LEAVING FIRST LIGHT IN THE MORNING. CAPTAIN, HOW FAR IS IT UP NORTH? UP NORTH AIN'T A PLACE, NEWT. IT'S A DIRECTION. WHERE WE'RE GOING IS ABOUT 2,500 MILES THATAWAY. 2,500 MILES? NOW WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO? I FORGOT SOMETHING. NOW, IF I AIN'T BACK IN A MONTH, YOU GIRLS START WITHOUT ME. YA! YOU PIGS TAKE CARE OF THE PLACE. IT'S ALL YOURS NOW. NOBODY ELSE'S. I SEE THE MORNING RUSH AIN'T STARTED YET. IT WILL NEVER START AGAIN. NOT EVER AGAIN. DON'T TAKE IT SO HARD, XAVIER. THEY'S PLENTY OF WHORES. RIDE UP TO SAN ANTONE AND RECRUIT YOU ANOTHER. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN HER MONEY, BOUGHT HER CLOTHES. I LOVE HER. AW, HELL, WE ALL LOVE HER, EVERY DERN ONE OF US. YOU KNOW THAT. YES... BUT I WOULD HAVE MARRIED HER. IF IT HELPS ANY, IT'S MY OPINION SHE MADE A POOR BARGAIN, GOING WITH JAKE SPOON. THANK YOU. WELL... GOODBYE, MY FINE FRIEND. GOODBYE TO YOU, MY GOOD FRIEND. GOODBYE. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY WAGON? JUMPED OFF THE ROOF. HERE'S WHERE I LANDED. THIS WAGON'S GOING TO MONTANA. YES, SIR, AND I AM, TOO. PIANO PLAYING'S FINISHED AROUND HERE.

RUN THEM OUT, NOW! FUNNY, AIN'T IT? ALL THEM CATTLE AND 9/10ths OF THE HORSES ARE STOLEN, AND YET WE WAS ONCE RESPECTED LAWMEN. HOW MANY HEADS YOU THINK WE'RE STARTING OUT WITH? OH, ABOUT 2,600 CATTLE AND TWO PIGS. THAT WAS DANG STUPID, BRINGING THAT SIGN ALONG. YOU'LL HAVE US THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THIS COUNTRY WITH THAT "WE DON'T RENT PIGS" PART. I FIGURE IT'S BETTER TO SAY IT UP FRONT. THE MAN THAT DOES LIKE TO RENT PIGS, HE'S HARD TO STOP. IF THAT AIN'T BAD ENOUGH, YOU GOT THEM GREEK WORDS. I TOLD YOU IT AIN'T GREEK, IT'S LATIN. WHAT DOES IT SAY, THAT LATIN? WELL, IT'S A MOTTO. IT JUST SAYS ITSELF. YO VARUM, YO VARA-FEET. YO VARUM DOUBLE FEET- YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT SAYS. YOU FOUND THAT IN SOME BOOK OR SOMETHING. MAYBE IT INVITES PEOPLE TO ROB US. ANYONE COMES ALONG THAT READS LATIN IS WELCOME TO ROB US. I'D LIKE THE CHANCE TO SHOOT AN EDUCATED MAN ONCE IN MY LIFE. JAKE! JAKE, STOP THAT! I DIDN'T HIT YOU, DID I? I WAS SHOOTING AT THE TURTLE. LUCKY YOU HIT THE RIVER, DRUNK AS YOU ARE. HOW'S YOUR THUMB? ALL THAT SORE FROM A LITTLE OLD MESQUITE THORN. AIN'T THAT SOMETHING-OW! IT'S MADE YOU SICK, JAKE. WHERE'D I GET SUCH A FANCY FOR YOU? COME ON DOWN HERE WITH ME. COME ON. WHY DON'T I MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE INSTEAD? HOW DO, MISS. I'M DEETS. CAPTAIN SENT ME AHEAD TO SCOUT A GOOD PLACE TO CROSS THE HERD. OH... MR. JAKE NAPPING, HUH? HE'S CAUGHT A MESQUITE THORN IN HIS HAND. BETTER TAKE A LOOK. MESQUITE THORNS- BAD POISON. DEETS?

YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR HAND. I MIGHT NEED YOU TO SHOOT A BANDIT IF ONE'S AFTER ME. OW! YOU BEST CROSS THE RIVER AND MAKE A CAMP. GOING TO COME A STORM TONIGHT. BE HARDER TO CROSS TOMORROW. OW! A STORM, YOU SAY? MM. THE WIND WILL HIT ABOUT SUNDOWN, BLOWING SAND, AND THEN LIGHTNING. DON'T TIE YOUR HORSES TO NO TREES. OOH! JAKE'S GOING TO WANT TO REST HERE A WHILE. HE CAN REST ON THE OTHER SIDE. GET... DERN LITTLE THORN. NOW YOU BE SHUFFLING CARDS AGAIN. ALL RIGHT, MISS. LET'S GET YOU PACKED AND ACROSS THE RIVER. I GOT TO GET BACK TO THAT HERD BEFORE THAT STORM COME HERE. ALL RIGHT. YOU SORRY YOU ON THIS TRIP, MISS? IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT. WELL, I BELIEVE YOU UP TO IT, AIN'T YOU?

DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR DERN HORSE! LORIE, NO! COME BACK HERE! HEAVE! HEAVE! HEAVE! HEAVE! IT WOULD BE EASIER IF YOU GOT DOWN FROM THERE. MAYBE HE'S STUCK, TOO. IF I HAD MY GUN, I'D UNSTICK HIM. AIN'T YOU BOYS GOT THAT WAGON UNSTUCK YET? NOT YET. WE LOSE ANYBODY? EVERYBODY'S FINE. EXCEPT I AIN'T SEEN MR. GUS NOWHERE. I SEEN HIM RIDE OFF YONDERWAYS RIGHT AFTER SUNUP. PROBABLY HUNTING FOR HIS JUG. HOW ABOUT THE CATTLE? I FIGURE WE LOST 20, 25. COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. AIN'T NO POINT IN GETTING CLEAN. YOU'LL CROSS THE NUECES RIVER BEFORE DARK. THAT'S FINE WITH YOU, RIGHT, LIPPY? YOU COULD USE A GOOD WASH. HOW MANY RIVERS ARE THERE BETWEEN HERE AND WHERE WE'RE GOING? OH, I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S A BUNCH, I BET, THOUGH. ME, I BE WISHING WE'D GO AROUND THEM. YEAH, THAT WOULD SUIT ME ALL RIGHT, TOO. I CROSSED AN OCEAN. I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M FEELING AFRAID TO BE CROSSING A RIVER. GUS. I FOUND YOUR HORSE. HE GOT AWAY LAST NIGHT IN THE STORM. SO I SEE. HERE YOU GO, DARLING. WHOA. I DON'T SEE YOUNG JAKE AROUND NOWHERE. HE RODE OFF A MINUTE AGO TO TRACK MY HORSE. TRACK YOUR HORSE? HE COULDN'T TRACK AN ELEPHANT IF HE WAS ONTO ITS TAIL. I BEST CALL HIM BACK BEFORE HE GETS LOST HIMSELF. WHAT WE GOT HERE? I'LL BET YOU GOT COFFEE BOILING IN THERE. I DO. I SWEAR, LORIE, YOU'RE AS PRETTY AS THE MORNING. I GUESS TRAVELING AGREES WITH YOU. YOU GET ANY PRETTIER, AND I MAY BE FORCED TO CUT THE CARDS WITH YOU AGAIN. I'LL SHUFFLE NEXT TIME. I DON'T TRUST YOU. WHO INVITED YOU TO BREAKFAST? UH-OH. JAKE, YOU NEVER WAS GRATEFUL FOR NOTHING. I RETURN A $50 HORSE, AND ALL YOU DO IS GRIPE ABOUT MY COMPANY. THERE'S TOO MUCH OF YOUR COMPANY. JAKE. I SWEAR, JAKE, ARE YOU JEALOUS? SURE, AFTER YOU TRIED POKING EVERY WOMAN I EVER LOOKED AT? WELL, MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO STAY AND DISCUSS THE LOVES I WON, I BEST BE GETTING BACK TO THE HERD. THANKS FOR THE COFFEE, LORIE. TRY TO KEEP THAT MARE HOBBLED AT NIGHT. SHE WAS ON HER WAY TO LONESOME DOVE. I CAN HOBBLE HORSES WITHOUT YOU TELLING ME. WELL, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW, JAKE. PACK UP. WE'RE GOING TO SAN ANTONE FOR A WHILE. SAN ANTONE? GOOD GAMBLING TOWN. WON'T HURT TO STOP A WEEK. WE'LL CATCH UP LATER. I AIN'T GOING TO SAN ANTONE. I BEEN THERE. DON'T BUCK ME! I GUESS YOU'LL GO WHERE I SAY GO. NOT TO SAN ANTONIO, I AIN'T. DERN IT! I WANTED TO GAMBLE A LITTLE BIT BETWEEN HERE AND DENVER. GO ON AND GAMBLE, IF YOU WANT TO GAMBLE. I NEVER SAID YOU COULDN'T. I JUST AIN'T GOING ALONG. WHAT? JUST LEAVE YOU HERE? SURE. WHY NOT? BECAUSE GUS'LL BE HERE EVERY MORNING WANTING TO TEACH YOU CARD TRICKS. WELL, THAT'S TRUE. HE MIGHT. SO, WHAT WAS JAKE UP TO? JAKE'S JUST UP TO BEING JAKE. IT'S A FULL-TIME JOB, YOU KNOW. IT TAKES A WOMAN TO HELP HIM, DON'T IT? I'LL GET SOME OF THE BOYS DOWNSTREAM TO KEEP THE CATTLE FROM SCATTERING. EASE OLD DOG IN. I BELIEVE THE CATTLE WILL FOLLOW. OLD DOG WON'T BE TROUBLE. HE'S LIKE ME. LAZY? MATURE. HE DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT CROSSING RIVERS NO MORE THAN I DO. YOU DON'T GET EXCITED ABOUT NOTHING EXCEPT BISCUITS, MAYBE, AND WHORES. MM-HMM. YOU WAS OVER AT THEIR CAMP, HUH? YEAH, ME AND MISS LORENA ALWAYS TAKE OUR MORNING COFFEE TOGETHER. I HOPE THE WEATHER DIDN'T TREAT HER TOO BAD. SHE'S FINE, JUST FINE. GOOD. THAT'S GOOD. YEAH, WE VISITED THE BETTER PART OF AN HOUR ABOUT VARIOUS THINGS... AND PEOPLE. YEAH?
