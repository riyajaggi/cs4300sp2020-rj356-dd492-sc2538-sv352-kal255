 NIKITA: Six years ago, I was taken from prison... ...and forced to become an assassin for a secret unit of the government: Black-ops program called Division that has now gone rogue. They destroyed my identity and they destroyed the man I loved. I escaped and now the man that trained me... ...someone I trusted, is hunting me. What Division doesn't know is that I have a partner on the inside: Alex, e new recruit with a dark past... ...who I've trained in secret to resist their control. Toge-then we 're going to take Division apart, one mission at a time. And the last word they'll breathe before the end will be my name.

 NIKITA: Hope you don't mind me dropping in unannounced. No. You were always one of my favorite customers. Thank you. I gotta hand it to you, Trevor. These are gorgeous. If something jumps out, I have any number of accessories to match. NIKITA: Hmm. That's nice. That's mine. NIKITA: Oh. Love. It's very you. I'm gonna need a mag of Lokken 2-12... ...a tomographic scope, and no questions asked. I assume the price is still the same.

 Afraid it's gone up. -Trevor. -Supply and demand, Nikita. Ever since you went rogue, your friends are in short supply... ...and there's great demand for your corpse. [CLICKS] I know. New deal, Trev. I keep the gun, you keep breathing, and never tell anyone I was here. You... You're not gonna kill me? Don't flatter yourself. I've got a much bigger target in mind. CROWD [CHANTING]: We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! We want justice! MAN: You're gonna pay, Dadich! The people gathered behind me are protesting... ...Mirko Dadich's overturned conviction due to prosecutorial misconduct. The government is deciding... ...whether to initiate deportation proceedings against him. But as of today, he walks free. Two years, and all my belongings are still here. America. Ready when you are, Mr. Dadich. [SIREN WAILING] [WHISTLE BLOWING] [PROTESTERS YELLING] MAN: Get him! Hold on. That's not Dadich. Someone's playing a diversion. He's hired protection. DADICH: Percy. Not bad. I feel safer already. Protection is just the beginning. In six months, you won't be hiding from your enemies. Trust me... ...they'll be hiding from you. Okay, kiddies, 30 seconds left. Come on, penetrate the system. Penetrate! [TYPING] BIRKHOFF: Ten seconds left before they dump you. Five, four... ...three, two... ...one. Fail. Alex, you never launched your exploit. -Why? ALEX: I don't know. -This hacker stuff is really complicated. -Actually, it's not, it's simple. Because, you see, I do all the hacker stuff. I write the exploit. I even make it look like a video game so your tween minds can understand it! [CHUCKLES] -You think that's funny? -Must be the drugs, sir. -You know how it is with junkies. -I thought our files were secret. Failure was on me, sir. Alex was having trouble finding the shell code and I gave her the wrong one. -Shouldn't be giving it in the first place. BIRKHOFF: You know what? This is pathetic. All of you, get out of here. The bunch of you. Get out! Up and out of your seats now. Not you. You stay. You two, get out of here. Left foot in front of the right one. You can handle that, right? All right. You stay here and you work this until you get it right. I'm gonna check back with you in half an hour. And it better be right. Because scrubs who can't pass the basics... ...don't survive very long in here. DADICH: Wonderful. He is no fun. Let's drink. What will you have? -Oh, whatever you're having. -Mm. You're not making our guest feel very welcome. Should've used the Astoria safe house. This place isn't secure. -What are you worried about? -Communist rebels. Hit men from the old country. Nikita. She is a wild card, she knows our security procedures... ...and she said herself that she's coming after us. She can't counter us without intel. Your mission was to find out who is controlling her. Nikita wouldn't allow anyone to control her. If she was getting help, it'd be a quid pro quo deal. And what, pray tell, are you basing your intel on? It's just a feeling. [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [DADICH CHUCKLES] Let me make sure I understand what we are toasting to. Your plan is to assassinate my successor... ...create a coup in the labor party... ...and return me to my seat of power in six months? PERCY: it's something we've accomplished before. Small nations don't present much of a problem. My accounts are frozen. I can't afford a down payment on your services. -Division would do this on contingency? -No. We don't have to. We know you stashed something more valuable than money... ...when you fled your country. What are you talking about? About 25 kilos of enriched uranium. Enough raw material for a low-yield nuclear bomb. What we don't know is where you stashed it. -And what would you want with... '? -A little uranium? Always comes in handy. Relax, Mirko. You're talking to me right now, not the United States government. You should think of this as a business transaction. I'm going to need some more time to think it over. Of course you are. And I'm going to need some other things as well. Anything you can think of, we can provide. DADICH: Good. [DADICH CHUCKLES] What does he want? Man just got out of prison. What do you think he wants? Five years ago, we'd probably be taking this guy out. We pimping for him now? Don't think of Mirko as an assignment, think of him as a client. If I don't address budget outs, I'm gonna have to make cuts of my own... ...starting with the permanent elimination of the young recruits. I'll call an escort service. No. As you would say, it's not secure. Get one of the new girls. Number 13. Alex. She'll remind Mirko of his homeland. AUTOMATED VOICE: Or they'll cancel me. I get it. You get me a name yet? No. How are you sure it's a protection mission? NIKITA: You said they activated Peters, Heilbrun, and Chang. Michael called them Huey, Dewey and Louie. Only used them for VIP security. I need to know who the VIP is, and their location. Not going to be easy. Still at bottom-level access here. Copy that. Lay low, I'll find another way. No. I can do it. I repeat, lay low. Do not blow your cover. You don't have to protect me anymore. I have everything under control. YOUNG WOMAN: Ronnie? Ronnie? Ronnie? Ronnie? ALEX: I got it. RONNIE: Alex, Alex, Alex. Always strung out. Always late. ALEX: I got it. Where is it? Where is it? Where's the rest of my money? -I gave you a 50. -You calling me a liar? Stop playing, Ronnie. I just need a hit. -No! -You bitch! ALEX: Stop! You make us feel good, we'll make you feel good. -No! -Oh, yeah. -Yeah. -Do this piece, Ronnie. -Let the girl go. MAN 1: What? -Who the hell are you? -Her fairy godmother. [ALEX 5055] Whoa. It's okay. it's okay. Hi. I'm Nikita. Nice to meet you. Begin. Just because you used a gun to kill, or steal... ...or whatever you did to land here, does not mean you know weapons. But you will learn. Dismantle and assembly will be second nature. Like breathing. -And you don't need to see to breathe. -Done. Alex. Excellent. -You handled sub machine guns before? -Not really. Must be the drugs. Alex, come with me. -Uh-oh. -What's wrong? You've been activated for an op. She's been activated? I've been down here two months and she's been activated. Stow it, Jaden. Bet you Michael's tapping that. INSTRUCTOR: Shut up and field strip these weapons now. You have five minutes. I'm gonna get that bitch. You keep moving around like that, you're going to look like a panda. Thom said he was in training for, like, a year before they used him. In the short time you've been with us, I've seen your attitude improve greatly. Especially considering you tried to escape your second day here. Michael must have seen the same improvement. He wouldn't be using you if he didn't think you were ready. And you are. Ch. Ready for what? Why won't anyone tell me the mission? We're told what we need to know. it's safer that way. So you don't even know? -You shouldn't be nervous, Alex. -Yeah? -What should I be? -Grateful. To be activated this early is a gift. And it's very rude to question a gift. [GASPS] -Help! Help! NIKITA: Just relax, Alex. Breathe in and out. Let me out of here! I will, I promise. For now, just breathe. Who are you? Where am I? You're at my place. I'm a friend. But if you're a friend, then you'd let me out of this closet. It's not a closet, it's a portable sauna. I built it myself. it's gonna help you get clean. -Why are you doing this? -Let's call it a gift. I know how to get clean, okay? I know how. I just need to come down easy, okay? There is no easy way down. I don't need a sauna! I need a hit! Very rude to question a gift, you know. Please. I'm gonna die in here. Look, I know it hurts, okay? Your nose won't stop running. Stomach's cramping. You feel like your head's gonna fall off. Believe me, I know. I can only promise you one thing. It's going to get worse before it gets better. As long as you're here, you're safe. No!No!No! [SCREAMS] -So where's the party? -In here. Hmm? That'd be great. Is there some place I could freshen up? Through there. [IN FRENCH] [CALL WAITING BEEPING] [IN ENGLISH] Hello. VIP is Mirko Dadich. The war criminal? South Shore Tower. Penthouse. Alex? Where are you? DADICH: Alex. I'm with him. -Get out of there. -I can't. Alex, champagne is ready. Be right there. That is one of the most amazing stories I've ever heard. I mean, to come from nothing. -Milking cows. -One cow. -One cow. -Ha-ha-ha. Now, let's not talk about me anymore. -More champagne? -I think we had enough, don't you? Nice view. Yes, it is. -Stop. -Stop? [DEVICE WHIRRING] DADICH: Come on! You're gonna party! ALEX: Uhn! Uhn! [OBJECTS CLATTERING] [BOTH GRUNT] [TIRES SQUEALING] [HORN HONKING] NIKITA: Who the hell are these guys? Oh, you gotta be kidding me. DADICH: Come on. Come on. ALEX: Please! [OBJECTS SHATTERING] ALEX: Let go of me. -Hold this. ALEX: Get off of me! DADICH: Yeah. ALEX: Stop! DADICH: Come on. Hey! [GUNSHOTS] Mirko Dadich? Get up. NIKITA: Get out of the way, Michael. MAN 1: Come on. Come on. Go, go, go. MAN 2: Andre is still in there. WOMAN: Leave him. -You okay? -Hell, no! [TIRES SQUEALING] Damn. PERCY: Think. Try to remember. It just... ...happened so fast. You're trained to think faster. You said one of their masks came off. You don't remember seeing a face? -I...  -She had two bottles of champagne... ...and Dadich was slapping the hell out of her. She was not ready. I want answers, not excuses. Who attacked us? How did they find us? And where is Mirko Dadich? Probably dead by now. Let's hope not. For your sake. [DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES] If you remember any more, please let me know. [DOOR Buzzing] Status? How's our friend from the safe house doing? Just keeps repeating the same word: osveta. PERCY: Did he say anything about Nikita? -We won't get any more out of him. -Yes, we are. Get Inquisitor down here. You're gonna love talking to the Inquisitor. Osveta, it's "vengeance" They were freedom fighters. Group trying to bring Mirko to justice for his crimes. Explains Nikita's involvement. She had a bleeding heart for the oppressed. The question is whether she approached them... ...or they hired her. Gr if she was working with them at all. Why provide sniper support for the team? It wasn't good support. She did kill one of them. She missed. She was targeting you. Find Nikita and you'll find Mirko. You might start by tracking the bullet we dug out of his friend. You called? [LINE RINGING] Come on, Alex. [COMPUTER CHIIRPING] NIKITA: Hey. How are you feeling? Did you eat yet? That's cool. I like it cold. Cold and spicy. So, as promised, I got you a few things. I know it's not Prada, but cute, right? Come on, the first step to feeling good is looking good. And I want my clothes back. What are you gonna do to me? You don't know me. You don't know anything about me. So, what do you want? I know you like smack. For me it was ketamine. K all the way. What am I gonna do to you? I'm gonna do what I wish somebody had done for me. You got me here. Trapped. So why are you lying? When I was high, I did something. Something I went to prison for. Something I'm gonna be paying for for the rest of my life. When I saw you, I saw a chance to stop it from happening again. -Where? -Where what? -Where did you see me? -I saw you walk into that crack house. Why were you there? Somebody like you... -...doesn't go by a place like that. -Alex. -Were you following me? -No. -How do you know my name? -I heard your dealer say it. What's your name? It's not a trap. When you're back to full health, you're free to go. Forget you ever met me. Core is tungsten carbide. -Hyper velocity, self-sharpening. -it's a Lokken 2-12 slap round. I could trace the tungsten to the production batch. Forget it. Nikita wouldn't buy from a manufacturer. She goes to the black market, face to face with the dealer. Those guys have their own signature. -That's how they modify the rounds. -I'll ID the specs... -...run them through ShadowNet. -Fine. Can you please stop saying ShadowNet? When you create your own software that owns access to every government... ...and law enforcement agency in the world... ...you can call it whatever the hell you want. ShadowNet. Taste the rainbow. MICHAEL: How'd you do? I got him talking. We had an interesting conversation. -Great. -Not exactly. Why? What do they want with Dadich? Same thing we did. They know about the nuclear material. Let's try this again, Trevor. -What did Nikita tell you? -I don't know. It was the other dealer who modifies Lokken 2-12 with an RDX compound. You think I'm stupid enough to lie to you? Let's find out. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING OVER PHONE] Answer it. Hello. NIKITA [OVER PHONE]: Hi, it's Nikita. ls Michael there yet? It's for you. How'd you know I'd be here? Wow. Good timing. Tracked that round fast. Thought it'd take you all night. -Feeling pretty smart, aren't we? TREVOR: Uhn! Always. I should have put you down in that alley. Oh, come on. ls that any way to thank me? MICHAEL: So you're not with them? -I don't even know who they are. -Though I do like their style. -Allow me to enlighten you. They are a group of freelance mercenaries. They're after the nuclear material... ...Mirko Dadich stashed away before he fled his country. -What? -Apparently he has a GPS device... ...that shows its location in Eastern Europe. We're 24 hours away from weapons-grade uranium hitting the open market. So how do you like their style now? You should have taken out Mirko when you had the shot. And let you die? Don't blame me. You work for Division and Division got in bed with this guy. Think Percy will admit that? He assumes you're with the mercenaries. If this comes back to bite us... ...then you are gonna be terrorist number one on every official list. Aw, oh. So Percy will have to officially admit... ...he's running a mercenary unit on the Pentagon's dime? You didn't hear me before. They already know what Percy is up to. But as long as he has his little black boxes everywhere... -...they can't touch him. -That what he calls them? Little black boxes? Nikita, they're real. Every dirty job, every cover-up... ...every little secret on the last five administrations. Now, you can quit or you can die... ...but you can't stop Division. No one can. You know what, Michael? You're right. I should have taken out Nlirko when I had the shot. [SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] ALEX: Papa. Papa. [SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN] [SCREAMS] Shh. Shh. You're safe now. You're safe. [OVER TV] The people gathered behind me are protesting... .. . . Mirko Dadich 's overturned conviction. [TYPING] AUTOMATED VOICE: Sorry I'm late. It got crazy. I know. Are you okay? I will be. Been playing dumb over here. So you saw something? One of the kidnappers is a woman. -Long blond heir, green eyes. -Good. That helps. -What are you doing? -What do you think? I'm kicking your ass, you little teacher's pet! Come here! You little bitch! [GRUNTING] [ALARM BLARING] MAN 1: Break it up! MAN 2: Okay, that's it. Break it up! [COMPUTER CHIHRPS] Not bad, Michael. Gotcha, blondie. AMANDA: Her name is Hanna Cushko. Ukrainian, 25 years old, grew up under Mirko Dadich's regime. Her father was a scientist in his nuclear program. So that's how she knows about the uranium. Tap airport surveillance, run facial recognition... -...we grab her on her way out. MICHAEL: it'll be too late by then. The second she gets her hand on Mirko's GPS... ...she'll call a teammate in Europe and give them the coordinates. She wants what we want. We need to get ahead of her. We need to find that GPS. [PROTESTERS YELLING OVER COMPUTER] [LINE RINGING] MAN [OVER PHONE]: 911. -Emergency? Yeah, I need to report a stolen vehicle. -Do you have the plate number? -Uh-huh. Yeah, I have it right here. it's A6876-44. -ls it your vehicle, ma 'am? -Yes, that's right. It's a blue paint van. My husband's. I'll give that information to an officer. Okay. [BLOW LANDS] [DADICH GRUNTS] Please. I swear. I don't know what is this GPS you're talking about. Wait. You really don't remember me, do you? My name is Hanna Cushko. My father was Ivan Cushko. He ran your secret nuclear program, but he kept no secrets from me. Cushko? Your father was a brilliant man. He was a close friend of mine. A dear friend. I know. That's why he was executed after the takeover... ...while you fled the country. I'm going back, Hanna. I'm going to take our country back... ...and I promise you, you will have your revenge. We both will. I want my family taken care of. The uranium my father enriched for you is his only legacy... ...and I'm going to sell it to support us. I can get you money. [GRUNTING] I assume you hid the GPS in a safe place before they took you to prison. You will take us there. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] MAN [OVER RADIO]: ... by the liquor store. Dispatch... ...Delta 17 reporting location of stolen vehicle. A6876-44. Van is at 34th Street, across from the subway terminal. Vehicle appears abandoned. Try matching prints we got at the safe house to visa applications on file. Cancel that. Move, I got this. -Got what? -Move. Okay. We assume... ...that Mirko stashed the GPS before his arrest two years ago. I dug up surveillance of the arrest. FBI caught him coming out of 34th Street station. They assumed... ...he was switching transport on his way to the airport. Check it out. AMANDA: He knew they were coming. He must have stashed the GPS beforehand. We need a time line of his last day. Every place he went, person he met, called, looked at. Yeah. We could do that... ...or I could just rewind this to 15 minutes beforehand. Hmm. He wasn't coming out of the station. -No, he was dropping something off. BIRKHOFF: Hmm. -Say it. MICHAEL: No. ShadowNet. Mm. [SIREN CHIRPING] [SIREN WAILING] -Very clever. -I thought so. [GRUNTING] Whoever you are, we don't want to shoot you. Clearly, you robbed the wrong people. No, honey, you did. You wanna get out alive... ...drop your weapons and hop on the first train. -I figure you got about five minutes. -You have less than that. [GUNS COCKING] -No, you do. -Weapons down! Don't hit me. -Michael. Thank God. -Where is it? -What are you talking about? -Where? Nikita! Nikita! Is that the GPS? -We gotta stop meeting like this. -What are you doing with it? That depends. What's the going rate for loose nuclear material? I'm kidding. You can have it. Oops. Michael, give me a gun so I can finish this whore. [LINE RINGING] This better be good news. Good news. We got Dadich back in one piece. Also, no one's getting their hands on the uranium. That stays buried. Nikita destroyed the GPS. And the bad news is she escaped. MICHAEL: No, the bad news is she started a gunfight. The police and FBI will be here any second. How do you suggest I explain this? [sighs] You're the heroic agent who foiled the terrorist plot... ...to deliver nuclear material into the hands of our enemies. And what about Mirko? The police are gonna be all over him in a minute. We have no way of controlling what he says. [SNIFFS] He was the one behind it. Now we can get back to business, yes? Listen, I forgive you for getting in between that silly girl and me. Perhaps I can get back to her as well. I'll tell her you said hi. WOMAN [OVER TV]: Former dictator and alleged war criminal Mirko Dadich... ...was killed in an attempt to commit an act of terrorism... ...on a New York subway platform. Authorities believe Dadich's attack was in retaliation... ...for his being imprisoned two years ago... ...on charges of conspiracy to assassinate his successor on U.S. soil. Good save, Percy. [GRUNTING] Alex. ALEX: Hey. I'm glad you're here. We didn't get to talk after the safe-house thing. I don't know. I wanted to...  I think you should hear what I have to say first. -Okay. -Percy is disappointed in your behavior. Your lack of discipline, destruction of property. He's given you two weeks to show visible improvement or it's over. What? -Jaden started it. She came in...  -Jaden is in the same boat. I just wanted to give you a heads up. I'm sorry, what did you wanna say? I just wanted to say thank you... ...for saving my life. Alex? [COUGHING] -Breathe. Just breathe. -No! -Stop. -No, let me go! Let me go! Go where? Just let me die! [sobbing] -I can't. -I have nothing to live for. Nothing. They're all dead. Everyone I love is dead. I know. I was following you, Alex. I've been searching for you for over two years. I know how you got here. Where you came from. I know who killed your parents. Trust me... ...you have something to live for.
