 Six years ago, I was taken from prison and forced to become an assassin for a secret unit of the governament... a black ops program called Division that has now gone rogue. They destroyed my identity, and they destroyed the man I loved. I escaped. And now the man that trained me... someone I trusted... is hunting me. What Division doesn't know is that I have a partner on the inside, Alex. A new recruit with a dark past who I've trained in secret to resist their control.

 Together, we're going to take Division apart one mission at a time. And the last word they'll breathe before the end will be my name. You're supposed to be in demolitions. After breakfast. Got busy work to finish. Don't be late. Yes, sir, sergeant sir. Sorry I'm late. They keep changing scheduling in here. They do that. I'll be quick. I need you on sentry duty for the next 3 days. I'm about to raise a little hell out there, and I need you to tell me when Division responds. Got it. What are you gonna do?

 Something I should have done a long time ago. Be ready. - Sorry. - No worries. You're pretty good at that. Thanks. You look just like your dad. You knew my dad? Sophie. Soph. Thank you. Lisa, don't move. Oh, God. Please don't hurt us. That would be a mistake. Since when do you own a gun? Since you killed my husband. Relax your hand. If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead. Your husband, Victor, he was a good man. What did he tell you about his work with homeland security? His work was classified. He never told any... He was trying to take down the Red Circle Triad. They deal in slave labor for some of the major fashion houses. Six years after his death, their business is booming. That's why I'm here, Lisa. I'm going after the triad. But you work for the triad. No... but I believe they hired the people I used to work for. They used me to get close to your family, to gain your trust. Well, that worked, didn't it? I didn't have a choice 6 years ago. I do now. I'm going to bring down the bosses who called the hit, but I can't do that until I know you're safe. You're going to take that car. You and Sophie. You're gonna drive it upstate to a lake house. You're gonna stay there till you get my call. No. No way. Listen to me. Once I go after these people, they are going to come looking for you. The only way to be safe is to take that car and drive to the address on the navigation system. Lisa, I'm not asking for your forgiveness. I'm asking you to protect your daughter. Well, that's not the mockup that we've agreed on. You know, I don't care. Talk them down, or I'm pulling the line. Sandy, call wholesale and make sure they get that price. Ms. Wiles? Roxanne Barnes. I'm the buyer from Midland. Midland. I thought you were coming next week. I know. Our schedule got shifted. I hope it's okay. And I just want to get it out of the way... personally, I'm a huge fan. Ah, so, you're here to put all my clothes beside lawn mowers and shotguns all across America. The world, actually. We have 3,600 stores. Beautiful. The quality's amazing, considering where it's made. Excuse me? Oh, Ms. Wiles, Midland has no problem keeping costs down. Your secret is safe with us. I'm sorry. I'm not following you. Oh, well, I've got samples. Maybe this will help. Here we are. What is this? It's just 63 people who were going to be your employees. Port authority found them last week, suffocated. A tragic accident of human smuggling. Your clothes are all made in sweatshops. The Red Circle Triad? They provide your slave labor, don't they? Who are you? Somebody who would never buy your crap. Tell me where the sweatshop is. You've had your lawyers running interference on this, so I know you know where it is. Tell me. Get out of my... ohh! You scream, and I will snap your neck. Not so glamorous, is it, feeling powerless? Now be a good slave and give me the address. Good morning. As you are called upon for field work, you can count on one thing... you'll be asked to perform highly involved tasks in exigent situations. What we like to call grace under fire. You've all been schooled in basic IED interdiction, but can you do it in a pinch? There's a bomb under this car. You have 30 seconds. Who wants to go first? Alex, you're up. And begin. I can't move. Get me out of here. Stop! Get me out of here! It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. - I got this. - It doesn't look like it. What, are you checking up on me? Not at all. You're wanted in operations. She ID'd herself as Roxanne Barnes. That's the name of an actual fashion buyer from one of those chain retailers, Midland. Apparently Nikita broke this lady's wrist. She's pissed off about something. So what does Tonya Wiles do? You mean besides provide stylish ready-to-wear fashion for the everyday woman? Here's a flag. She was questioned last year by customs about a forced labor scam run by the Red Circle Triad. Everybody lawyered up. It went nowhere. She's going back to her first mission. Her first kill. Got a bead on her yet? Well, she took on Tonya in Manhattan. Uh, 27th Street fashion district. Am I missing something here? Why would Nikita follow up on a kill she made 6 years ago? The case is way closed. Maybe she's re-opening it. # Whoo-hoo # # Whoo-hoo # Nikita, have a moment? I've been down here a year. I got nothing but moments. Good, 'cause I'm on a schedule. What have you got behind your back? Nothing. I may just have to fight you for it. You scared? - Terrified. - Well, okay. One arm behind my back? It's your funeral. Ohh! Michael. Want to even the odds? That was pretty good. That's the big secret? A key card? It's your ticket to the outside world. You've been activated for your first op. I get to leave? No, the activation's provisional. You have to come right back here after you complete the assignment. Like a learner's permit. But you have to see Amanda first. Such a tease. Don't attack so hard. I thought that was the point. Kobudo's about defense. If all you do is thrash at your opponent, you're gonna get nailed. You still haven't let go of what happened this morning, huh? Hey, where you going? I gotta go to the computer lab. Right now? 2 out of 3 after lunch? Yeah, I'm there. Amanda would like to see you. Yeah, I gotta go... now. What do I always say about preparation? It's the key to success. Your first provisional assignment. It's a big step. Please don't say, "You're a woman now." Well, you have grown up over the last year. I take some measure of pride in that. The truth is, you've earned our trust. What is my first assignment? Just remember. Trust is not something you win. It's something you build. And that's your assignment... to build a trust so powerful that it would make someone welcome you into their family. Family? Congratulations, Nikita. Your references are stellar. I can see why my wife wants to hire you. Oh, it's not just that, Victor. It's Sophie. She likes Nikita. I can tell already. Honey. Oh, sorry. No one said this thing was going to take over my life. Sentry 1 to Sentry 2, front yard is clear. What is it you do, Mr. Han? I work for this new agency called homeland security. Bush just created a new, uh, cabinet post for it. You work for the government? Yes. And I've got a few enemies already. Stop asking him questions. You're supposed to be gaining their confidence, not blowing it. If you feel uncomfortable, Nikita... No, I just... I didn't know this is what I'd signed up for. Complete the mission. Ok, then... It's fine. I was an au pair for an expat family in Shanghai. They had all kinds of armed guards around. Then we're good. You'll be safe, and so will my little girl, as long as we keep her away from peanut products. No, that's your thing, honey. We don't know that princess is gonna have the same little peanut allergy as daddy, do we? Welcome to the family, Nikita. I gotta go. Protect the homeland or whatever. I was hoping not to use that. This is pointless. I had a freak-out. So what? You had a panic attack, Alex. An involuntary reaction. To what, I'm not sure. Let's talk about it. I'm fine. I've seen this a thousand times, Alex, especially with new arrivals. We take you in, turn you into something new, even better than you were before. But there's always something you can't let go of. What triggered the attack, Alex? What was going through your mind? You really want to know? It's this place. It reminds me of how I used to live. How I was forced to live. When you were held by the Russians. Why don't we just say it? When I was a sex slave. They locked me in a hole and woke me when it was time to perform. At least they had the decency to keep me high the whole time. You make a good point. And you're obviously suffering from post-traumatic stress. Here. Let me help you. - There. Happy? - I feel better already. We still need to work on your manners. Sorry to ruin the whole day-spa vibe you've got going in here, but I don't need your help. Alex, you don't have a choice. Ok, so what is this place? Headquarters for the Red Circle Triad in New York. Nothing much going on right now, but at night it turns into a pretty happenin' spot. Lady Gaga was there last Friday. That's great. Where's the boss? Name is Chen Lo, according to the intel group. He runs the business from a back room in the northeast corner. Give me a second. Ok, I got eyes inside. See for yourself. The guy in the suit is Chen Lo. You catching that? Real-time subtitles. How cool is that? Yeah, congratulations. Looks like Nikita hit the sweatshop, but she let the sweatshop boss get away. Let him get away? That's not in her DNA. Exactly. Run a scan. See if you can snag any wideband RF transmissions. Got a signal coming from that room. She put a tracker on the sweatshop boss so she could follow him to Chen Lo. Crafty. She have to be nearby to track it? No. Military-grade transmitter. She could be anywhere in the city. Man, Nikki's all hard-core about this, huh? Kinda crazy how she's going back to her greatest hits, no pun. Just have the team on standby, all right? Nikita, I'm gonna head out to the farmer's market. I want to get some stuff for dinner. You good? Yes, we are, mama. Yes, we are! We're very, very good. I thought so. I'll be back. Bye-bye. We'll be here. Bye-bye, mama. Nikita. Nikita. Take the baby for a walk. Of course, my husband can't come. Just had to work on Sunday. Hey, I'm trying to protect an entire nation. It's gorgeous out. I think I'm gonna take her for a walk. Good idea. Don't want the hubby home alone with the young nanny. Oh, all right. You just may have to pay for that. Just make sure to take one of the guys with you, Nikita. That's good. Keep walking. Give me the baby. What do you want with a baby? Give me the baby now. I'm not giving her to you. Or to him. We're not going to hurt her, Nikita. This is Roan. Standby for abort and clean. Do not get ahead of yourself, do you hear me? Control your asset, or I will. Sophie will be returned to her mother. We have orders to not hurt them. So Victor Han is the target. Why does he have to die? Look, if you don't do this, Division will call a clean. That means they clean everything and everyone, including you and that child. And there's not a damned thing I can do about it. You got that? We don't have a choice. Give me the child. Put the device in the crib, arm it and leave. Hey, hey, hey. She asleep? Out like a light. I'm gonna go enjoy some more of the day. Go for it. Nikita. Thank you. I don't know what we'd do without you. Clear. Alex, where are you? Do you like it? It's part of our spring collection. Get this off of me. It's not up to me. It's up to you. Aah! Aah! The jacket has an electronic lock which is synchronized with the heart rate monitor around your chest. If you can bring your pulse down to 51 beats per minute, the lock will release. Aah! You panicked during a simple exercise, Alex. Division won't tolerate that kind of physical liability in a recruit. You have to prove you can pass this test, or it may be your last. Aah! Aah! # I know you want it # # I know you want to # # I know you want it # # I know you want to # I got nothing. Birkhoff, anything? No, but I like this channel. Keep your eyes on the models. You know how she likes to dress up. # Baby # # I know you want it # # I know you want to # # I know you want it # # I know you want to # # I know you want it # # I know you want to # # I know you want it # # I know you want to # # Baby # # Talk to me, tell me how you feel # # Baby girl, talk to me # # Talk to me, tell me how you feel # # Talk to me, tell me how you feel # Smile! Aah! Aah! Victor? Nikita. I should have known. Nikita. When they told me some crazy bitch burned down my factory, I wasn't sure. All these years, I thought I killed you. You were triad. Well, like they say... No, you couldn't have pulled this off on your own. And homeland wouldn't have stood for it. You made a deal with Percy. That's why we faked your death. Percy. He's gonna get an earful from me after today. # Hold my lovin' # # Hey, hey, hey # # Hold my lovin' # How could you? You had a wife and a daughter. The insurance took care of them, Nikita. Everyone came out a winner... except you. In a matter of seconds, you're going to be surrounded. What do you think you're doing? I hate chatting online. Let's do this face-to-face. It's bulletproof. So you gonna take down the triads now? Is that it? It was just gonna be their man in New York. Then I found out Victor Han is their boss. What? You don't know. Victor Han is alive, Michael. Of course you don't know. You never asked. You probably don't even know why he was a targeted. He had to be dirty. Oh, he was. He was a double Agent for the triads. He got a big fat promotion thanks to Percy's bait-and-switch. Not for long. I need a location on Victor Han in Hong Kong. Who've you been talking to? No, let me guess. Nikita. What'd she say? How could Percy do such a thing, Michael? Make a deal with a criminal? You want to know how? I assume you had your reasons. And you knew never to ask. I always loved that about you. Did the right thing, Michael. The government came to me with a serious situation. A triad double agent had worked his way so high up into homeland security, he was attending NSC briefings at the west wing. Now, maybe you don't recall, but this was 2 years after 9/11. Homeland was brand new. Do you have any idea what would have happened if that information had gone public? It would destroy their agency. The government came to us with a problem, and we solved it. Making him into a martyr was my idea. Yeah, but to keep him alive. Why? Wouldn't want any blowback from the triads. Of course, you didn't take any money from them, either. You better get going. I'll text you Han's address. Nikita's probably on her way to Hong Kong as we speak. Madam, don't you think you should have declared these before returning to Hong Kong? Hmm. Yes, I was. I was going to. I'm sorry. Is this the part where you tie me up? Listen, I will pay the fine. It's fine. It's totally fine. I just... I don't want to go back in that line out there because it's a little long, and isn't there a side door or something I could go through? Certainly. There you go. Something wrong? No, I just didn't know we had company. 51 beats per minute. Then you'll be free. Ohh! Face the flame. Breathe in through the nose, exhale through the mouth. Without blowing it out. Tell me about your pain, Alex. It's the only way to let it go. Maybe I like my pain. There was a girl who used to say the same thing. Turned out to be one of our best. But she didn't become great until she set herself free... by confronting her deepest, deepest fears. I was 13. I was with my parents. We were driving. There was an accident, and we fell into the river. We were sinking. And there was so much... water. My papa lost control. I tried to scream, but I couldn't. My parents died in that car accident. And you people put me under that car. It's all right, Alex. You can let go. I'm proud of you, Alex. You really do remind me of Nikita. You flew all the way out here for me. That is just simply stupid. I just had to see you again. I spoke with Percy. It's funny. He didn't want to get into it. Percy's not really a talker. That's okay, I worked it out. So you went and grew a conscience, Nikita? Now you're a thorn in Percy's side 'cause you think you can, what, make a difference in the world? You in prison being man-raped. That'd be different. You're going to tell me who knows about this. Did you tell Lisa and Sophie? Oh, you remember their names. Don't get sanctimonious. You know all about living a lie, Nikita. Victor Han was a name I created to infiltrate homeland. As for the wife and kid, they were just my cover. They were your family. I have a family, here. A wife and two children, and I want to keep it that way. Who else knows I'm alive? I'm not really a talker, either. That's okay. My boys here got a few power tools to help bring you out of your shell. You think you're gonna break me? Nobody likes a crusader, Nikita. I tried it for a few months. I got blown up. I can't believe I ever thought you were cute. I can't believe I never had my way with you. You couldn't handle me. Not then, not now. The nice thing about the slave business is that I can handle anything I want. Honestly, I think we would clash. Sort of like lipstick and peanut oil. Please... please. Shut up before I change my mind. Victor Han, a former high-ranking official in the United States department of homeland security, a man thought to be dead, found on the steps of the police department, bound and gagged. Apparently left there by an unknown crusader. No, it's not going to be a problem. It's going to be an opportunity. - For who? - For you. Yeah. No, no. Easy, easy. Look, we both agree Victor was sloppy. But you... you could take over the operation, couldn't you? No, you're right. No... no commission. For the time being. When they returned her to me... the people you used to work for... they threatened me. Told me not to talk. Who knew her own father was behind it? He'll pay for what he did. I decided I'm not going to tell her. As far as I'm concerned, Victor died that day. You said you didn't want forgiveness, but you deserve it, Nikita. At least from me. Thank you. The people who made you do this, can you ever stop them? It's going to take some time. What else you got? Pulse never broke 60. Damn, girl. What'd Amanda do to you? I don't know. We just, uh, talked. Guess it worked. Yeah, well, wait till I get under there. Thanks for pulling me out the first time. You would have worked it out eventually. I mean it, Thom. So, uh, didn't you say 2 out of 3 with the BO staff? I did, didn't I? You really want to get your ass kicked by a girl? Girls get no mercy. That's the first rule of kobudo. Yeah? What's the second? So how'd you do it? I'm not done. What do you mean? She's hiding something. Sorry I missed you earlier. Got caught up. How'd it go on your end? You're supposed to be in logistics. Just tell me, straight. Why did we have to kill an innocent man? One that works for our own government? We don't ask questions. You'd follow him over a cliff, wouldn't you? Just like that. Percy gave you a gift. He gave you a second chance. He can have it back. You don't have a choice. What about you, Michael? Do you have a choice? Grow up. Why are you so loyal to Percy? Why? Because I owe him my life. # Ooh # # I can hear you talking # # For doing all the working # Michael? # I can hear you talking # # Just can't hold on # # To what I believe #
