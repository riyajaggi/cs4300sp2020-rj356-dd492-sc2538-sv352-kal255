 Nikita (2010â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 11 - All the Way - full transcript 
 Alex informs Nikita that Division is sending her on her first mission to kill the leader of a crime syndicate. Alex is uneasy about taking someone's life but is reassured by Nikita who insists on helping her with the kill order. Birkhoff informs Percy and Michael when he discovers the shell program that a Division mole has been using to connect to Nikita in the outside world. When the mission doesn't go as planned, Nikita makes a quick decision in an effort to clear Alex's name. Inside Division, Jayden attempts to reveal Alex as the mole but Thom steps in and a shocking accident clears her name.

 NIKITA: Six years ago, I was taken from prison... ...and forced to become an assassin for a secret unit of the government: Black-ops program called Division that has now gone rogue. They destroyed my identity and they destroyed the man I loved. I escaped and now the man that trained me... ...someone I trusted, is hunting me. What Division doesn't know is that I have a partner on the inside: Alex, a new recruit with a dark past... ...who I've trained in secret to resist their control. Together, we're going to take Division apart, one mission at a time. And the last word they'll breathe before the end will be my name.

 Too much. Let's try the next one. [sighs] -This one? -Maybe. What do you think, Michael? It's beautiful. Although, I think I prefer the sapphire. It's better for concealing the weapon. We haven't talked about the mission yet. Slash pocket in the seam. You may be right. One of our agents fell out of an active op... ...and this mission requires a young woman. AMANDA: it's been months of planning, and we only have one shot at success. Now, completing this op will move you from recruit to field agent. This would serve as your graduation.

 AMANDA: Do you know what that means? -Sure. It's a kill job. I have to waste someone or I get wasted myself. Everyone knows that. I like the sapphire dress too. [GASPING] This is ahead of schedule. COMPUTER: Way ahead. I'm going out on a surveillance scout tomorrow. It's gonna be okay, Alex. We handle this like any other mission. You set them up, I knock them down. COMPUTER: But if I fail to kill, the penalty is death. Not if I'm your reason for failure. Otherwise, half of Division would he dead by now. Don't worry. You won't have to kill anyone. [SCOFFS] I was on the way to the hotel. -What? -Don't bother. MAN [ON MONITOR]: We are live at the scene... ...where the motorcade was ambushed. According to witnesses, several gunman opened fire... -...instantly killing the ambassador. -They got him at the airport. We started tracking their advance team three weeks ago. I was sure they were gonna take him at the hotel. -You would have stopped them. -This isn't working. [NIKITA SIGHS] Picking up on their trail, predicting their moves. We're behind Percy. -We need to be ahead of him. -What if we hack their network? -No one gets past Birkhoff. -I thought you already did. -Said you installed a back door. -The shell box? I made that when I was a recruit. It's not sophisticated enough to access the network. -But it's a window into Division. -it's not a window. It's a paper cup phone. it's a two-way chat. And we have no one to chat with. What if We did? You're talking about turning a Division agent? I'm talking about making one. You said yourself this isn't working... ...two of us on the outside trying to predict their moves. But if I was on the inside... ...I could tell you what they were planning before they do it. -That would be very dangerous. -No risk, no reward. Isn't that what you taught me? MAN [OVER INTERCOM]: Call l help you? MARY: Hi. I'm Mary from Miracle Wedding Concepts, just running a little late. MAN: One minute while we scan your vehicle. Sure. Scan away. Yeah, I am so screwed. Miss Miracle, relax. I'm here to take pictures. You do what you normally do. I don't normally do this undercover stuff, okay? I'm a wedding planner and a businesswoman... ...and I'm not a criminal, no matter what the IRS says. The government appreciates your cooperation. Yeah. Like I have a choice, right? [GATE OPENS] Here are the yellow billy balls that we combine with the succulents. ROSALEE: Hmm. -Modern, elegant. Ooh, and here, your more traditional hydrangeas. ROSALEE: Oh. Gorgeous. MARY: Mm. ROSALEE: Your reputation precedes you. MARY: Oh. Ha, ha. ROSALEE: Bria, aren't they gorgeous? I don't know. I can't see it. -Dad? -Hold if. What is if? BRIA: Dad, what do you like, modern or traditional? Whatever you like. It all looks good to me. -Good, because we bought it all. -I can't deal with her. This is your wedding and it's gonna be beautiful. Now, Bria, you say that you can't see it. Well, that's what my assistant, Jillian, is here to help you with. We call it Picture This. What I do is take pictures of the party space... ...to show you all of the possibilities. The cocktail area, the grounds for the reception. Then we use photo-imaging software... ...to show you exactly what your wedding will look like. [clicking] ALEX: Hey. What have they told you about the target? Uh, nothing. I'm supposed to recon security and take pictures. I know. Here. Use these. They're better. Five guards total. Four satellite, one personal. There may be more at the wedding. -You already took the pictures? -Yeah. I know what angles Michael likes. He'll like those. Nikita, why are you here? Look, the owner of this house is Gaddiel Zaman. East Coast head of an Armenian crime syndicate. We have an opportunity here. You mean we're gonna complete their mission? No, I'm gonna complete the mission. You are gonna take the credit... ...and graduate to a higher level of clearance within Division. No. I don't need you to fight for me and I don't need you to do my homework. I can do this. We both know you can't. GUARD: Miss McMillan? Nikita, Division killed my family. Becoming an agent is gonna help me bring them down... ...and this is the only way I become an agent. I can do this. GUARD: Miss McMillan? ALEX: Here. Let's go back inside. ALEX: Sorry. I lost my way. [BOTH GRUNTING] Thom. THOM: Go ahead. I'll catch up with you. JADEN: Hey. Can I talk to you? In private? I don't think this is a good idea. I'm an agent now. We can't...  Just chill, okay? I'm not looking to hook up again. Though, we can talk about that later. -Jaden. -Here. What's this? It's a makeshift print pad. She used alight for the depression, eye shadow to transfer the thumbprint. -Slow down. Who exactly are you... ? -Who do you think? Alex. I bet she used it to break into Percy's office. Remember when jerk-off tried to pin that on me? -Where'd you get this? -From her room. She had it stashed pretty good. -And why bring this to me? -Because you're an agent now. And because I trust you. THOM: Nervous? I was too before my final test. Why? Should I be nervous? You're gonna be there, right? I'm just running interference. You're the one who has to carry the ball. Or I get benched and other metaphors. Yeah, I didn't come here to give you a pep talk. I just wanted to warn you to watch your back. Jaden's coming after you. Why? Did she say something? She's always had it in for me. She thinks you and I are, you know, together. She's mistaken. Anyway, I thought you should know. Thom. What's it like? To pull the trigger? Well, I can tell you what it's not like. It's not like the person's there one minute and gone the next. They stay. It's been over a month... ...and the girl I killed, the spy... ...I still see her face... ...every day. Thanks for the pep talk. You'll be okay, Alex. You're strong. Stronger than me. I knew it the day I met you. So Henry came through this time. Cost us a pretty penny, let me tell you... ...hut the intel is solid. ALEX: Who is he? NIKITA: His name is Kyle Lenkov. He's a drug smuggler who managed to infiltrate a pharmaceutical corporation. Anyway, company's onto him... ...so they've hired Percy to take him out quietly. Division will move in two weeks, so we need to move now. So you wanna be the bunny or the piggy? Wait a minute. You're coming with me? Yeah, in case anything goes wrong. We're not gonna get a chance like this again. Taking out a Division target will get their attention. You fit the profile of someone they'd recruit. There can't be any mistakes. After all this time, after all of this training, you're still worried about me? Look, I've thought about this too. A lot. And I knew we couldn't move until you found the right target. But this .... This is the right target. A drug smuggler, a poisoner, and he's marked by Division. Even if we do nothing, he's dead. He may be marked, but you're the one who has to pull the trigger. -I know. -And you've never taken a life. I know. You don't know. Believe me, you don't. Takes away a part of you you can never get back. Nikita, are you trying to scare me? Do you want me to back out of this? I want you to know with absolute clarity what you're getting into... ...because this is the moment when you ask yourself: "How far am I willing to go?" How far are you willing to go? I'll take the bunny. Seems like the target has a lot of security. You don't have to worry. This is a surgical strike. No one's gonna know what's happened until you're gone. I will personally be on hand to provide support... ...and make sure everything runs smoothly. [BEEPS] [BEEPS] MICHAEL: We'll be able to redirect security by using our B team. I'll be in communication with you, watching over you at every moment. ALEX: You sound like you're my guardian angel. During this op, that's exactly what I will be. After you get the target alone, as discussed, you will close range. This is your primary. Two-cc hypodermic needle that will be filled with potassium chloride. If you hit the skin, you hit the plunger, job's done. Try it. That's good, but aim for here, the larynx. Paralyze the vocal cords with one blow. Now he's dead and he's quiet. Hush. Hush. Uh, hey, Michael. Can I get your eyes? I want to show you something. All right. Keep working on this. Remember, the larynx. Okay, everybody, out. Come on. Let's go. Out. Out. Out. Where's the fire, Birkhoff? I can't believe it got past me. I can't believe I didn't see it. See what? -What's the emergency? BIRKHOFF: Ahem. We have a breach. Tiny, but huge. PERCY: Do tell. BIRKHOFF: Well, I was running a system diagnostic... ...rerouting network traffic, using a new technique I picked up... ...from, uh... Ahem. From the engineer. Truth is, if I hadn't met him, I don't know if I ever would've spotted it. Spotted what? [chuckles] A shell program. Planted behind the firewall... ...like a back door that leads from the Division subnet out into the real world. Somebody hacked into our server? I thought that was impossible. No, no, it is impossible. Look. It's like a private chat room, okay? It's two ways, none of the chats are logged... ...so there's no way to tell how much it's been used or what's been said. -Nikita. -That'd be my bet. Question is Nikita and who? The shell can be accessed from any terminal inside Division. Anyone with the code can bring up the shell. Uh... Uh, whoa. Wait. [COMPUTER BEEPING] So this is how she's been getting ahead of us. She does have someone on the inside. MICHAEL: Someone who knows our current operation. Sir, I suggest that we delay the Zaman op. No. We proceed as planned. Birkhoff will monitor the shell and we tell no one about this. We've gotten ahead of Nikita. I want it that way until she's dead or captured. If we proceed, we're putting our own people at risk. That's why you're gonna be there with backup teams. One stone, two birds. [PAUL ANKA'S "EYE OF THE TIGER" PLAYING ON SPEAKER] ANKA [SINGING ON SPEAKER]: You gotta fight to keep them alive [BEEPS] It's the eye of the tiger The dream of the fight. Rising up to challenge a rival. The last known survivor Stalks prey in the night. Watching us all with the eye .... MICHAEL: This is a good spot. Any closer, we'll spook the guards. Alex, do you have visual on target? Cocktail area. Three minders. COPY... MICHAEL [OVER RADIO]: Have our wedding planner move the bride. ALEX [OVER RADIO]: En route. Miss Miracle. ANKA [SINGING]: They stack the odds Till we take 'em to the street. Excuse me. ANKA [SINGING]: We kill with the skill to survive. Been up on their cameras. No sign of her yet. Maybe Nikki couldn't wrangle an invitation. She's in there somewhere. Have grab team B take position at the south entrance. Bria, hi. Philip is ready for you and your pictures by the fountain. I thought we were doing pictures after. The ones with the family, yes. These are just you. The ones your dad requested. And the light is absolutely perfect, magical. Hmm. Well, we all have to do our duty, right? [MARY & BRIA CHUCKLE] ALEX [OVER RADIO]: Bride is clear. -Copy that. MICHAEL [OVER RADIO]: Retrieve the weapon. [ALL CHATTERING] Thank you. -Can I have a glass of water, please? -Absolutely. Hey. I'll be right here. Mr. Zaman, hi. Bria's requesting to see you. Well, we can't deny the bride, can we? THOM: Target's on the move. MICHAEL [OVER RADIO]: Copy that. Create a spill. [CROWD MURMURING] MAN: What was that? Hey, take care of this, okay? A fuse just blew? THOM [OVER RADIO]: Affirmative. Keep your eyes peeled. She could be anywhere. She's there. They just haven't found her yet. I'm not gonna wait for her to interfere with the hit. Flush her out. [KEYS CLICKING] [BEEPING] Marco, wait there. Bria. Bria. -Huh. Where is she? -She was just here. Hey. Marco. [ALL GRUNTING] [MARCO Yells] Don't move. Don't move. On your knees. Get down. Now. GADDIEL: Please. -Alex, what's going on? Syringe is broken. There's a guard down. I have his gun. -Where's the target? -He's here. -Please, I'm begging you. -Shut up. Take the target. There's no Silencer. MICHAEL [OVER RADIO]: Take the target. Please think about what you're doing. Please. [GUNSHOT] [SIRENS WAILING] Nikita's on-site. I repeat, Nikita is on-site. Please, I understand. You have a job. [Door OPENS] Mr. Zaman. [Gunfire] GUARD: Run, sir. Get the gun. [ALL GRUNTING] Michael, crash the party. PERCY: Kill Nikita and the target. -All right. Let's go. [GUESTS SCREAMING] I'll get him to the car. [Gunfire] Oh, God. We're dead. AGENT 1 [OVER RADIO]: Careful. It's Nikita. Use caution. She has our agent. There's no way out. It's over. I couldn't do it. I couldn't pull the trigger. You were right, and now we're both dead. No, we're not. Hey, you're gonna give them something more important than Zoman. You're gonna give them me. -What? -it's the only way. Listen to me. -They'll kill you. -Percy wants his black box. They'll take me and you'll get me out. AGENT 2: Team B, prepare to enter. The crawl space to the silo, the back door, it's still secure, right? .l.. -Right? -Yes. -Okay. That's how we get out, Alex, you and me. -Now hit me. -Uh .... Make it good. AGENT 3: Michael, over here. [ALEX Grunts] MICHAEL: Hold your fire. [ALEX GRUNTING] Prepare to exfil. We're bringing her in. [ZAPPING] Listen, about the target...  The target was taken care of. I know. -it's just if Nikita wasn't there...  -We'll deal with it later. Let's just focus on the positive for now, hmm? Relax, Alex. Don't be nervous. Nikita, meet Alex... ...the young recruit you tried to save from serving her own country. Tried and failed. Her loss. Don't listen to her. She's just jealous of the new model. Tell me, recruit, how does it feel to have brought down Division's greatest traitor? She's not so tough. Little girl... ...your 15 minutes of fame starts right now. Enjoy. I think it's gonna be a little longer than that. Fine. Twenty minutes. All right, give me a minute. [ALEX Grunts] Sorry. You know, I have to admit, despite all the trouble you've caused... ...still feels good to see you back where you belong. I never belonged here. You were born here. This is where your new life began and where it was always meant to end. It's not over yet. Almost. But before you go... ...you will tell me where you've been getting your intel from. I think the question is, where haven't I been getting it from? Division's got more leaks than BP, and I have friends everywhere. See, and I think you have one here, and when I find out who that person is... ...either you or they will tell me where my black box is. Or you'll do what? I'm not gonna do anything. Now, her, I can't speak for. Alex. Michael's requesting to see you, in medical. How are you feeling? I'm fine. It's through and through. I got lucky. Listen, have they debriefed you yet? No. When they do, tell them your gun jammed. -But they heard...  -They didn't hear anything. Tell them your gun jammed. Do you understand me? Good. Alex... ...how did you get away after she grabbed you in the house? I didn't. She heard you coming towards the shed. She dropped me to grab a gun. That's when I made my move. NIKITA: The inquisitor, huh? This is gonna hurt. You have no idea. So, what's it gonna be? Knives, needles, electroshock? -You have a preference? -Not really. None of them are gonna make me talk. Good. I don't want you to talk. A young recruit of ours has done enough talking. I just want you to listen. AMANDA [ON TV]: Describe your feelings... ...being back here. It's been two months. NIKITA [ON TV]: Has it been that long? Wow. AMANDA: Extended cover has been treating you well. You look lovely. Thanks. Can 't say I miss the pajamas, though. AMANDA: Tell me about him. NIKITA: He's nobody. He's just a guy. AMANDA: What's his name? NIKITA: Daniel. Daniel Monroe. AMANDA: And he's your lover? Heh. My lover? Is this the '30s? AMANDA: Your boyfriend? Amanda, he's .... Look, I know what you're getting at. A boyfriend or whatever you wanna call it... ...it's just part of the cover. No one would believe the girl that we created is single. Now, what you need to understand is that everything I do... ...is in service to Division. [BEEPS] We were always truthful with you, Nikita... ...about the rules here. Were you truthful with us? I can tell you something true right now. Why don't you hold that thought? We're about to get to the best part. [LOCK BEEPS THEN CLICKS] DANIEL: Okay, so, what kind of trouble? NIKITA [ON TV]: Daniel, the less you know, the better. [DANIEL SIGHS ON TV] Okay, so let me get this straight. You expect me to quit my job... ...move, what, halfway around the world with you... ...start a family, never look back, and never ask why? NIKITA: Yes. DANIEL: Sounds great. When do we start? NIKITA: Just like that? Just like that. [TV BEEPS] I can't believe you. That was his home. You're right. We should have trusted you. We were the only real family you had, Nikita... ...and you betrayed us. Nice work. RECRUIT: Good job, Alex. -Thanks. Hey, I'm proud of you. Hey. -I heard you did good out there. -Thanks. JADEN: I heard different. I heard you choked, couldn't pull the trigger. At least that's what everyone else is saying. My gun jammed. I'd he happy to demonstrate it for you sometime. Hmm, how about right here after everyone's cleared out? -Lunch is almost over. -We could do that. Or we could meet on the mat down on the training level... ...settle this in front of everyone who likes to talk. It's a date. [BEEPING] [BEEPING] AMANDA: This is really just the first of many interesting moments... ...spent in service of Division. -Let's look at another. -Stop. Oh, we're just getting started. I never lied to you. That was just my identity. You were never my family. We clothed you. We fed you. We taught you how to protect yourself. You taught me how to kill and you forced me to do it. Nikita, if it's a question of who sinned first... ...we can always go back to the girl on death row. You were a killer before you came to us. THOM: Alex. [ALEX GASPS] Don't move. Thom, I can explain. That's okay. I worked it out. -I just don't believe it. -Okay. -I was just down here to...  -Don't. Don't. I wanted to tell you someday. -I was hoping to. -Shut up. Turn around. I said, turn around. If you truly want to end the killing... ...you'll give up your source and surrender the black box. I know you think you're fighting fire with fire... ...hut if you keep down that path, everyone will burn... ...including innocents like Daniel. You know what will happen if our secrets get out in the open. You will do more harm than good. Give up the black box. It's too late to save yourself... ...hut there may be time to save others. Right now... ...I'd be wondering about who's gonna save you. [grunting] She's loose! [Yells] [BOTH GRUNTING] [ALARM BLARING] Nikita's on five, moving to the central elevator. [over PHONE] Lock it down. BIRKHOFF: Nikita's taking the elevator to the surface. Shut it down. Done. it's stopped. Where? Nikita. [grunting] [Gunfire] [ALARM BLARING] [BOTH GRUNTING] -No! -Was everything a lie, huh? Was everything just a lie? [GUNSHOT] NIKITA: Alex? Alex. [THOM GASPS] We have to go. I shot him. [GASPS] I'm sorry. There's nothing you can do. -The guards will be here any minute. -I'm not leaving him. [THOM GASPING] Go. I can handle it. -They're looking for the mole. -I know. I can handle this. We'll make them pay. The shell's gone. Call me when you're on the outside. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You're gonna see me. [SOBS] [GUARD SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY IN DISTORTED VOICE] GUARD [IN DISTORTED VOICE]: Don't move. PERCY: After a very meticulous search of the facility... ...we've discovered that Nikita has indeed escaped... ...through a hairline fracture in our perimeter's defense... ...which has now been sealed. She has learned the art of deception. I'll give her that. You worked very closely with Thom, didn't you? Did you see anything during the time that you spent with him... ...that led you to believe he might be the mole, the breach? No. From where I stood, he was loyal to Division. I was convinced he was loyal too... ...hut then I discovered he used this to access my office. Stole a key card to frame security for the theft of a bomb. If you're feeling sorry for him, don't. If he deceived you, then you were justified in taking him down. I need to know you believe that before I can move you to another level. I know why he had to die. I know why I had to kill him. It hasn't weakened my belief as to why I'm here... ...or my commitment to my mission. It's made it stronger. Good. Well, then congratulations. You're an agent now.
