 NIKITA: Six years ago, I was taken from prison... ...and forced to become an assassin for a secret unit of the government: Black ops program called Division that has now gone rogue. They destroyed my identity and they destroyed the man I loved. I escaped and now the man that trained me... ...someone I trusted, is hunting me. What Division doesn't know is that I have a partner on the inside: Alex, a new recruit with a dark past... ...who I have trained in secret to resist their control. Together, we're going to take Division apart, one mission at a time. And the last word they'll breathe before the end will be my name.

 WOMAN: In here, sir. Take your time. I'll be right outside if you need me. [whirring] [Gunfire] MAN: Everybody down! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] Get down. Everybody down. Get down. Get down, get down. You stay down. [LEADER SPEAKS IN FRENCH] [SIREN WAILING] [IN FRENCH] [IN ENGLISH] Damn it. -Aah! -Shut up. We're going for a walk.

 Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Take me. I'm a better shield. Get your ass on the floor. Now. MICHAEL: We've isolated the Wahhabst terrorist cell from Pakistan. All strike teams have entered the theater. We got five heartbeats grouped in the northwest corner. Snipers have visual confirmation on Hasan and four bodyguards. Bring us to green. [CELL PHONE RINGING] Switching to three. -Percy. -Guardian Canada One, unsecured. [CELL PHONE BEEPS] Go. Secure. The package is out in the open. Has it been compromised? No. The data update was interrupted. I've taken a wound from local authorities. They're looking for me. How did this happen? What did... ? Don't answer that. Just find cover and go quiet. I'm coming to you. Re-dial this number at precisely 1600. Alpha and Bravo teams in position. I need to be in Montreal in two hours. -What? -First available flight. -Got a commercial jet leaving JFK at 11. -Not good enough. We're in the middle of an operation in Pakistan. Only thing is a military cargo transport taking off from McGuire in half an hour. -Get me on it. -All right. But don't expect Bloody Marys and peanuts. What the hell is in Montreal? Hey. So, what the hell is in Montreal? Keep your voice down. Three weeks. That's how long it took to plan this. -it's too important to screw up. -Good thing I'm leaving you in charge. -What's in Montreal? -Something I need to take care of. Something more important than Division? I am Division. [COMPUTER BEEPING] AUTOMATED VOICE: Percy's on the move to Montreal. Percy never goes into the field. I'm sure he takes his vacations in Logistics. Well, he's gone. He and Michael went at it, then he bolted. The grown-ups are fighting? Right in front of the kids. So something got his attention in Montreal. Percy is rattled. That's not like him. Unless it's Nikita. He wouldn't go alone if it was her. Why hide it? It's gotta be something else. Is there any flash traffic from Canada? Nope. Zilcho. -Does the CIA have a station there? -In Montreal, yeah. They're monitoring the world's most polite terrorists. Give me the news feeds. You sure you wanna get in Percy's business? Montreal. There's a labor strike at an oil refinery. The Canadians wanna trade for a defense man. Some bystander went all Robocop at a bank robbery this morning. No, no, stop. Pull up the last one up. Laid down suppressing fire. Definitely a professional, possibly military-trained. We were extremely fortunate to just come away with injuries. The suspects who robbed the bank weren't so lucky. He created chokepoints here and here. There's no chance of pursuit. That's our SOP. He's Division. I was about to thank the man for saving my daughter's life. And then he just marches out the door and starts firing. That bugger moved so fast... ...it was like he was a superhero or something. Bank officials say the man in question who had come to check... ...a safety deposit box is a landscaper from Saint-Henri. Authorities are already searching his apartment. He has been identified as Owen Elliot. He is still at large and considered extremely dangerous. No Owen Elliot on personnel or NOC lists. It's because he's off-hook. The only reason he surfaced is because something went wrong. I go rogue, Percy sics Michael on me. You get his personal attention. [DOGS BARKING] [Tinkling] I'm sorry, miss, this area's an active crime scene. Chill, CSI, I'm not a reporter. Gonna see my friend. Is that legal? Thank you. No, no, no. Wednesday's not gonna work. I sent the schedule and I specifically said... Hang on. Hi, how much for the glass pieces? -Sorry? -The stained glass in the window? It's handmade, right? My boss saw them and has to have them for this lobby we're redesigning. Do you have a contractor discount? Sorry, they're not for sale. Please, hang on. Let me call you back, okay? Listen, I'm really sorry but if I go back empty-handed... ...my boss is gonna kill me. Please, please, please. Let me see what I can part with. Thanks. You're saving my life. I really just make them for myself but I think I've got a few I can spare. -So you're a designer? -Uh-huh. Well, no, my boss is. What's all the commotion next door? Oh, um, I just got home. Is that the guy from the news? I recognized this neighborhood. -Did you know him? -Not really. He kept to himself. -Wow, those are beautiful. -Oh. Heh. These really aren't my best but .... They're perfect. Thank you. -How much? -Oh, it's okay. Consider them professional samples. Really? You rock. He's gonna love them. Thank you. [POLICE RADIO CHATTER] [whistles] WOMAN [OVER PHONE]: How can I help you? Hi. My husband, the idiot, he lost his phone... ...and he can't remember where he put it, of course. And I was talking to a friend of mine and he said... ...that you guys can find cell phones now using GPS... ...or cell towers or something computery like that. Account holder's name? Owen Elliot. Account number? JMK3185 triple 9. Password ? Uh .... I can't release the information without the password. Right. Listen, I'm not actually looking for the cell phone. I'm looking for the cheating bastard attached to the cell phone. The password is probably the slut's name. Bambi or Chloe or Jennee with two Es. He couldn't keep it in his pants if it was tied to his zipper. DO you know what I'm saying? Girl, you're preaching to the choir. Just hold on a minute. NIKITA: Hands. Put them up slowly. Good place to hide. A school gone to hell. Remind you of Division any? Is that what you got from the bank? Percy send you? Hello, gun? Means question time's for me. Though I am here because of Percy. That's one of his black boxes, isn't it? See for yourself. Where did you get that butterfly? Listen. What did you do to her? She didn't compromise the mission. The box is secure. What did you do with Emily? I'm not Division. Who are you? [CELL PHONE RINGS] You're early. What went wrong? My position was blown. An operative made a play for the package. It's still secure, but you may wanna move up your timetable. Female, 5'6"? -Who is she? -Nikita, a rogue agent. How come I wasn't briefed? Briefed? Owen, what did she say to you? Nothing. She wanted to know who I was, I was able to get the drop on her. -But you let her live. -I had a choice. Either pursue her or protect the package. -My mission is...  -Tc protect the box. You made the right choice. Location Alpha, one hour. I'll meet you there myself. And if you see Nikita again, you're to terminate on sight, all right? -I'll take care of her. -No. For once, she's not the priority. Take your men and secure the rendezvous point. And Roan, once delivery has been made, I want complete containment. -You want me to cancel the courier? -He's had advanced training, so be ready. MAN: All right, recruits. Right this way. Keep it moving. Bluetooth devices. Use 128-hit link keys to encrypt communication. Crack the key and holy Watergate, Batman. Any cell phone within range becomes an instant hug. JADEN: Thom. Call me. -I don't have your number. -I think you do. Wow. Snappy banter. You should write for reality TV. Has it really been that long since you've had sex? At least some of us have had sex. What did you say? JADEN: Nothing, sir. Sorry, how do I put this into pairing mode again? Ah. Thanks. Can't stand that guy. Yeah, me neither. Just don't let him know that. Owen called you, didn't he? What are you doing here? Told you to leave work early, that he'd talk to you when he saw you. I'm calling the police. They're gonna kill him, Emily. Not the police. The people he works for. People I used to work for. Owen's a landscaper. You still believe that? He told me not to believe the news. He's not the man they're describing, he's .... He's shy. He didn't even talk to me the first year he was here. Why would anyone wanna kill him? Because he made a mistake. Several, actually, starting with you. What? Most people wanna make a connection. They wanna feel safe. And they wanna feel loved. In Owen's line of work, those feelings get you killed. They're what got my fiancé killed. I don't wanna see it happen again. Are you criminals? It's a little more complicated than that. He lied to protect you. But he can't do it anymore. Why should I believe you? Because I've been through it. I am the only one who can save Owen. All positions, do you see the target? FOUR: This is Four. Target acquired. I repeat, target acquired. Six hundred meters. [CELL PHONE RINGS] -Emily? -We need to talk. What's he doing? -Where's Emily? NIKITA: She's safe. Where is she? We're at her place, she's fine. But she won't he if you give Percy that box. I'm gonna kill you. PERCY: What is he doing? Stop him. All positions, green light. Take him down. FOUR: He's out of range. What happened? He's on his way. [sighs] [LOCK BEEPING] BIRKHOFF: This isn't cool, man. MICHAEL: You punched in a clean code, right? BIRKHOFF: Yeah, but what are we doing here? MICHAEL: We can't close hooks on Backhoe without command level sign-off. We need Percy for that but I need details on his current mission... ...before contacting him. Okay, cool. What are we really doing here? Put it this way, Birkhoff. You can help me or I can tell Percy what you've been doing... ...after hours in the video conference room. With the girls of Amsterdam. -Owen Elliot? -Owen Elliot. Got a hit. Percy's got him under a privileged NOC file. Well, what's his assignment? BIRKHOFF: Landscaper. Dude's a freaking gardener. MICHAEL: it's nowhere near standard-issue cover. Doesn't give him excuses to travel. Check this out. His designation: Guardian. Never heard of that. Have you? No. And he's got cleaner-level training. Dude's a had-ass. He's also checked out on some hardware I've never heard of. Serial number BB-4905. BB .... [MOUTHING WORDS] So that's what you're there for. What's what you're there for? Ahem. Michael? What's what you're there for? [DOOR CLOSES] [EXHALES] [GAS PS] We need to talk. She's safe, Owen. -Where is she? -I'm not your enemy. Where is she? Owen. Hey, come here. Wait. -What do you want? -I want the black box. And I wanna help you escape from Division with Emily. Why? Why did you save that little girl? At the bank? You could've waited out the crisis, figured out an exit. That's what your training tells you to do but you didn't. You acted differently because it was the right thing to do. Thanks to Emily, you know how that feels. -Leave her out of this. -She's in this, we all are. Do you even know what that black box is? That hard drive contains evidence of every job Division's done. All the nation's dirty laundry and more. As long as Percy has it, he is untouchable. It's been his leverage against the people who put him in power. That is why I need to destroy it, because it is the right thing to do. Is what she's saying true? I don't know. Because Percy doesn't want you to know. There's only one way to be sure. Where's the black box? What the hell were you doing? Nothing. Just having some fun. Having some fun? By breaking into Percy's office? You wanna put a gun to your head, fine. It was nice knowing you. I thought I could find my file. Your file? Don't you ever wonder, Thom, why we're here? You know why were here, Alex. I don't mean what they're training us for. I mean, why us? Why me? What is it that they saw? What made them say she's not a waste of space? That she's someone worth saving? I have questions too. We all do. But what you did was reckless and you put me in a had position. You pull something like that again and I'll be forced to turn you in. You buried it? Like in the ground? -Where? OWEN: You first. How did you escape Division? How did you remove your tracker? I will tell you. Not now. We don't have...  [GUNSHOT] Owen. No, no, no. [GUNSHOTS] No. Hey. Emily. Emily, look at me. Look at me. Hey, Emily. She's gone, Owen. We gotta go. Owen, no. Owen, no. Where is it, Owen? You took something of mine, something I entrusted you with... ...and I want it back. You know how this is gonna turn out. Eventually, your brain will cease to be able to distinguish... ...between reality and hallucination and you will cough up the location. It's inevitable. I'm just curious. What did she tell you? That Division is the evil empire and I'm the big bad wolf? Whoa, whoa. She had a problem with her kidneys. One day, she collapsed... ...in the hallway. So I picked her up. I brought her to dialysis. And the next week and the week after. Her name was Emily. Robinson. You took something of mine too. I'm telling you, man, this isn't good. Not good. -I thought you said we got in clean. -We did. But I don't know. I must have missed something. These security logs have me entering Percy's office. Okay, we'll explain it to him. I can make the case it was Division business. Easy for you to say, teachers pet. Me? Whipping boy. What do you want me to do? Sir? You've got a call. -Percy? -Nikita. Thanks again for helping with that phone back. What? Whatever. No, the workaround you figured out is genius. Yeah, yeah, I'm very brilliant. Now, move. MICHAEL: Birkhoff, get a trace on this. -This is Michael. NIKITA: Hello, Michael. Oh, Nikita, where are you? Fiji. I needed some R and R. North America. Yeah, I hear Nadi is lovely this time of year. It's a hit humid. I wish I could chat but this is isn't a social call. I need to speak with Percy. MICHAEL: He's indisposed. NIKITA: Find him. Damn, she spoofed the tower pings. Switching to satellite tracking. MICHAEL: Okay, go ahead and patch her through to Percy. PERCY: Percy. NIKITA: Hello, Percy. PERCY: Nikita. Your ears must've been burning. I was talking about you with your boyfriend here. NIKITA: How is he? -He's been better. -What do you want? -What do I want? What I want is to empty a clip into your face. Yeah, well, we both know that's not gonna happen, right? I mean, unless you plan to do irreparable damage to the country. Yeah, yeah, you're protected. For now. What I want today is a trade. You give me Owen, I give you back your black box. I know what you did. What? You need to work on your sneaky-sneak, Nancy Drew. You went where you ain't supposed to be. I don't know what you're talking about. Thom's room? I saw you coming out of there. He was just helping me out with a problem. [STATIC OVER EARPIECE] You doubling down on that? Look, Jaden, you want Thom? He's yours. Just get out of my face. She's got to be in Montreal. Yup, northeast quad rant. Trace Percy's location. She may he trying to close in on his position. On it. What the hell is she doing? PERCY: I miss you, Nikita. No, I really do. You had the most natural trade craft instincts of anyone I've ever seen. No matter what the situation, no matter how desperate... ...you always had some gambit, some bluff you could play. -You think I'm bluffing? -l think you're bluffing. Black box serial number BB-4905? Tell me you weren't stupid enough to give the box to Nikita. You didn't give it to her, did you? Did you? Was that a bad thing? Shoot him. Do that and you'll never get your box back. What do you think, I don't have backups? Losing one means nothing to me. All right. I'll take a peek inside this. I'm sure there's tons of useful information. Maybe even some secrets about you. You're messing with the wrong weapon. No. You made that mistake a long time ago. Circle gets the square. She is 3.5 miles from Percy's position. Where's Percy? BIRKHOFF: Freighter down by the old docks. You've got a yourself a deal. Tomorrow morning, 0700, Olympic Stadium, north side. Bring Owen, no one else. Agreed. You sure this is what you want? He's a blip, a rounding error. I could kill him and no one would notice. That's the difference between you and me, Percy. You'll kill anyone at any time. I don't waste life. MICHAEL: Percy, we found her location. She's not far. I can call the local...  Don't bother. I've got men. I'll send them but she'll be long gone now. We'll be ready for her tomorrow. Thanks. Earlier today, we had a security breach. Someone entered Percy's office without permission. We're gonna find that person. You step forward now, take responsibility... ...and I will personally put in a word for you. Okay. -Where were you at 1500? -In my room. Funny. There's no log of that. In fact, ahem, you were completely off the grid at that point. Not my fault. BIRKHOFF: Anyone here that can vouch for her? -I didn't think so. -Oh, this is bull. I didn't do anything. You're trying to set me up. -You think I don't know that? -Hey, what the hell's going on in here? Michael, Michael, Michael, listen. I got us covered here, man, okay? Better one of them than us. But we can fix it so it's only a slap on the wrist. A meal penalty, solitary maximum. -Everybody get out. Go. -Uh...  This has nothing to do with the recruits. I was in Percy's office. I'll take responsibility. If there's any blowback, it Will be on me and me alone, got that? [BODY THUDS] All positions, check in. MAN: Port side clear. [GRUNTS] She's here. Clever. We need to get you off-site, now. I'll take care of things down here. [BODY THUDS] Drop the weapon. Was it worth it? No. Drop the gun, Owen. I can't let you kill him. I want him dead just as much as you do. OWEN: You just let me do this. NIKITA: I can't. You kill him now, those black boxes get out to the world. Innocent people will be hurt. Innocent people like Emily? Yes, like Emily. She told me about you... -...how you cared for her. -Aww. Shut up. You cared about someone, Owen. Remember that. I will help you get through this. We will destroy the black boxes then kill this smug son of a hitch. Do this now, people will die. There's just one problem. I don't care. [GRUNTS] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Hey. Hey. Still working on that BIOS hack, huh? You kind of sucked at it in class. -I had it under control. -Right. So the CPU was supposed to start smoking? Well, I was still thinking about the demolitions lesson. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Listen. Um .... I wanted to .... I didn't get the chance .... -I could have dealt...  -You're welcome. Look, I know what you're going through, all right? You ask yourself, "Did they make a mistake? Do I really belong here?" But you gotta forget all that. This is your second chance at life. I mean, how often do you get a gift like that? Thanks. Don't. I got it. I'm not .... Forget about it. Thom. I'll see you later. Hey, chief. You wanted to see me? Operation Backhoe went well. Strike teams took out Hasan and his men cleanly. No losses for us. Computer breach? Yeah. Um .... Yeah, that was part of, um .... Ahem. That is, there was a legitimate .... [CLEARS THROAT] You should talk to Michael. It was his call.
