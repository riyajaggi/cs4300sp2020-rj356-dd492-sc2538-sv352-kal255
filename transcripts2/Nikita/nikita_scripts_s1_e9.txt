 Nikita (2010â€“2013): Season 1, Episode 9 - One Way - full transcript 
 Nikita and Michael temporarily team-up to kill a terrorist who murdered Michael's family many years ago. When Percy learns this information, he sends Division agents to kill Nikita, who ultimately compromises the mission, leading to Michael's capture by the terrorist group. Alex is caught going through medical files inside Division so she creates a lie that involves Jaden and almost blows her cover.

 Are you in Uzbekistan for business or pleasure? Pleasure. - Hello, Michael. - What the hell are you doing here? Thanks, my flight was lovely. Yours? - If you think you can stop... - That taxi driver ripped me off. You picked the wrong mission to mess with. Relax. I'm not here to stop you. - Ah, Nikita, right on time. - Hello, Henry. What'd you do? Rewire the navigation system so it can accept a closed-circuit feed? - Satellite. Harder to track. - You said you had something for me. Yeah, a keyword flag you had me set was tripped.

 - Where's the report? - Look under the seat. The person you're interested in is coming out of hiding for a meeting. Kasim Tariq. Personal for you? You could say that. Though it's going to mean more to... To a friend. Intel came via the CIA, who's been keeping tabs... ...on an Uzbek money launderer named Timur Ahmedov. He has a meeting next week with al Qaeda's main bagman. Kasim Tariq. - Kasim. - Yes, Kasim. Where's the meet? Ahmedov arrives in Tashkent on Tuesday.

 He's booked an outbound flight 48 hours later. We can assume Kasim has the same window. - I'll prepare the ConOps. - Michael... ...Uzbekistan's a touchy subject for the State Department. I would have to go to Oversight to get sign-off on an op. - That takes time. - We don't have any time, in 48 hours... Officially, I cannot assign any mission into Uzbekistan. - You know what this means. - Moreover... ...given your personal interest in Kasim, I recommend an administrative leave. Forty-eight hours ought to cover it, don't you think? Thank you. I know you're uncomfortable sometimes... ...when I conduct business outside the lines, but there's a reason for it. You understand that now, don't you? Michael's on the move. I know roughly where he's going, but I don't know the exact destination. - So find the frequency of his tracker. - The one in his body? - Yes. - How am I supposed to get that? Trackers are implanted by the doctors in Medical. Their computers have a database of everyone's frequency, ID code... ...which changes every week. Normally, Medical's a fortress, but you still have yourself a free pass. There you go. - Are these the receipts? - Yes. The craft used... ...in the USS Cole bombing could only have been from a few vendors. These are their ledgers. Somewhere in those numbers... ...are the people who killed your soldiers. Look, how did you talk them into giving you these? Oh, a few bribes, some connections. They trust me. What are they gonna say when they find out you handed them... ...to a U.S. Naval intelligence officer? - I will be fine. - No. When word gets out, your life's not gonna be worth squat. That's why I'm arranging protection for you back at the base. So please, go there. Okay. As long as you don't make me eat that... What was it called again? Meat loaf? Oh, please. I can still taste that goat stew from the other night. Get out of here. - Goodbye, Michael. - Straight to the base. - Daddy. - Hey. Did I get in the wrong car? Who is this huggy monster and what'd you do to my daughter, Hayley? - Hey, you. - Hey. Why are you not in your car seat? I tried, but she screamed bloody murder. - You know her. - Yeah, I know. Strong-willed, like her dad. The pain is keeping me up. Maybe some inflammation. Some discomfort's to be expected. Let me give you some codeine for the pain. No, I can't have narcotics. Staying clean, you know. As long as you're not taking them recreationally, should be fine. Amanda says even the slightest taste and it'll bring me back to junkie town. Look, I could give you non-narcotic painkillers... ...but I'd have to dig them up. Wait here. All right. Take two of these when you feel you need them. Thanks. You're a lifesaver. Michael's digits. Frequency, 134 kilohertz. ID code, 3835. Rock 'n' roll. You picked the wrong mission to mess with. Relax. I'm not here to stop you. I'm here to help you kill Kasim. @ http://thepiratebay.sx/user/Zen_Bud  Gun on the ground. And the baby. The knife in your boot. - Michael... - The knife. Michael, I'm not going to hurt you. Really? You know, my shoulder's still sore from when you shot me. - Then I saved your life. - And then I saved yours. Great. Codependent relationship. I'm gonna ask you again, what are you doing here? I told you, I'm here to help. I know what Kasim took from you. And what makes you think I need help? What ma...? Well, let's see, uh... You're flying solo in a hostile environment. Trying to take out one of the world's most elusive terrorists with nothing... ...but the name of a shady money launderer. At the very least, I think that might be a two-man op. Am I at least one of the men? - Still doesn't mean I can work with you. - Why not? Because I am still Division and you're still... - Nikita. - Right. Look around, Michael. We're in Uzbekistan. - No Percy, no Division, no rules. - It's not that simple. - Because you make it complicated. - That's not it. - Then why don't you believe that I wa... - Because I don't trust you. Fine. You wanna know what I want? After we kill Kasim, I want you to take a look at your loyalties. I mean a good look. You're not blind to what Division's become. Hits for hire, mop-up duty for thugs. - Is that what you signed up for? - Percy has his reasons. Percy's out of control. And you've ignored that in the hopes that they'll be able to help you find Kasim. If we do this, you're free and clear. To do what? Leave Division and join you? Baby steps. You wanted to see me? You thought you closed it, but you pressed minimize by mistake. I did what? What is that? Now, I should probably tell Percy. Relax, Alex, I'm not gonna turn you in. A lot of things go on here that are under the radar. I'm late for class. Get me Security. This is Hanson in Medical... Ah! If we do this, we do this on my terms and I call the shots. That's fine. What kind of intel do you have? Not much. I have no read on Kasim's location... ...but he has a meeting with Timur Ahmedov. - The money launderer. - That's right, I figured... We follow Ahmedov, he leads us to Kasim. Where's Ahmedov staying? About five floors above us. Ahmedov travels light. He only has one guard. - What were you thinking? - Shoot and scoot. Take out the guard, grab Ahmedov and pump him for info. We could do that. Or we could get what we need without him even knowing we took it. Okay. So, what weapons were you thinking of? I have the perfect ones in mind. American. Your Russian is excellent. As is your English. - And you are? - Also a fan of soccer. And beautiful women. Oh! Excuse me. Oh, jeez. - I'm sorry. - So sorry. Just going to go freshen up. Do you mind watching my drink? - Of course. - Thank you. Package incoming. Starting my sweep of the room. Cloning the SIM card for Ahmedov's phone. SIM card is cloned. Heading back to the bar. Oh, no, no, no. I'm done, I'm done. Enough. Oh, no, no. Nonsense. Where I come from, this is like mother's milk. Oh, I'd hate to meet your mother. She was an icy bitch. Oh, jeez. Is that your phone? - Oh, yes. Thank you. Ha-ha-ha. One more. Oh, I, really, I... - Where did your friend go? - Oh, he went up to the room. Up to the room. Yes, the room. Perhaps you'd like to finish this party up there? You mean it's time to leave? All clear. I know something that would make this party complete. She can meet us upstairs. Your partner? Is she pretty like you? Tall, smoky voice. Very sexy. You won't be disappointed. I'll go find her. Frame grabs from Michael's hotel in Tashkent. - Is that? - Nikita. What is he thinking? Does he realize the pain he's about to bring on himself? He's cut off, alone. He's being resourceful. Nikita's not a resource, she's a target. One he's been able to draw out. You realize any action you take will compromise Michael's op. Yeah. He's already done that. This is Percy. I wanna task a strike team to Uzbekistan. Earliest possible deployment. Target is Nikita. Pair up, people. Surveillance works better with a partner. - Looks like it's just me and you, stumpy. - What? We knock this assignment out together, instructor's gotta cut us a little slack. - I can't do this. - Okay. - Decaf Red Bull today? - Shut up, Jaden. You're gonna get your bitch on no matter what? - For you, anytime. - Alex. Conflicts with Jaden again? That's not why I'm here. We found Dr. Hanson unconscious in Medical. What? When? This morning. The logs have you as the last to visit. Did you see anything? No. He gave me something for my wrist and then I left. He seemed fine. He'll be awake in a few hours. We'll know everything then. Now, according to Ahmedov's itinerary, the meet's gonna take place... ...in this abandoned farmhouse just outside town. Isolated, single-access road. Smart. Now, we know Ahmedov's security situation... ...but Kasim's a different story. He's always heavily protected, a minimum of four guards. - So a close-quarters kill would be... - Suicide. That's why we go long. Do you have the hardware? H-S Precision with a match-grade, 7.6, two-barrel. - Gemtech suppressor? - No, I didn't wanna sacrifice the range. I still have to be within 600 meters. You? And what makes you think you're getting this bad boy? - I'm the better shot. - Oh. I knew you'd gone rogue, I didn't know you'd gone delusional. I'm sorry, I remember somebody... ...who set the distance-shoot record at Division in her first year of eligibility. Who was that? No respect for the man whose mark you broke, huh? - Sucks to be you. - Yeah. Nikita, you know I need to take this shot. I know. Ahmedov's here. And I got him. It's Kasim. Target acquired. No shot. There's a propane tank out back. It goes boom, they run out, you tag Kasim. No, it's too dangerous. I can't let you go down there alone. Can't wait it out. We have to control the play, Michael. - You'll have to take out his car. - I know. All right, take this. I have. Mine is better and I don't need it up here. - As long as you bring it back... - This mission's over. I know, Michael. I'm a big girl now. I don't need a good-luck charm. Take it anyway, big girl. Attagirl. Car's down. He's not going anywhere. - Going for the tank. - Copy that. Lost your earpiece? Damn. No. No, no, no. Nikita, Nikita, Division agents are here. I repeat, Division agents are... Son of a... I'm Division. Damn. Kasim, wait. - You set us up? - No. - Pull up right there. - This heat. - I know, it's just... - Yemen. It's just for a few more months, a year at the most. Michael, I'm fine. Really. Look, this is important. An investigation of this scope? If I do well at this, you and I can have our pick of assignments. How do you feel about being stationed in... ...oh, I don't know, Hawaii? Remember that honeymoon we didn't have? Well, Hawaii would make up for that, right? Sun, surf. Tanned women in bikinis running around, grass skirts, hula dancing. Listen to me. There'll never be another woman for me. You know that, right? Unless, of course, she's really hot. - All right, I'll be quick. - Okay. I'm sorry, pumpkin. I'll be right back, okay? Okay. All right. - Hello? - Are you at the base? - Kasim? - Are you at the base? - Yeah, why? - Goodbye, Michael. Kasim, what are you...? Briefcase. Hello, Michael. What a surprise. Are you on assignment in Uzbekistan? No, of course not. You were looking for me. You may not believe this, but I'm glad you found me. I've often wondered how you have fared. You probably don't realize... ...but you changed my life as much as I changed yours. What happened in Yemen convinced my brothers that I was worthy. I was true jihadi. All the while, you thought you were using me. In reality, I ended up using you. But what I did, I did for my faith. What is it that drives you, Michael? The thought that one day, I'd finally be able to kill you. That is why you are destined to fail. I fight in God's cause, you do not. But do not commit aggression. You forget that part of the Koran? If you're gonna twist its meaning, at least quote the whole passage. - Your family was never the tar... - Do not talk about my family. - You were to take the case to the base... - I trusted you. - Where the Semtex should've detonated. Elizabeth and your... Do not say her name. - Collateral damage, that's all they were. - Son of a... We are warriors, Michael, and this is war. Now, tell me, how did you find me? Who are your sources? I swear... ...on the soul of my family... ...you will die today. Damn it. Vehicle recovery. Someone's up past her bedtime. So, what kind of goodies you got stashed up in here? Holy crap. Homegirl made a break for it. Smile. Shoot. You're blinking in that one. - What the hell...? - Oh, don't worry, Percy won't notice. He'll be interested in why you're trying to escape... ...through your secret little passageway. - My secret pa...? I was following you. Except you don't have one of these. Stop. I'm not gonna turn you in. If I did, it would mean instant cancellation. - I don't want that. - You set me up. Because I need your help. Talk? Fine. Water finished, now fire, huh? We have to hurry. I don't know where Kasim's other men are. Gun. Where's Kasim? - Ugh... - Where did Kasim go? Michael, don't. Answer him. Where did he go? Airport. Airport. We need comms. Give me the ear bud. - Michael. - We might be able to intercept... ...before he clears security. - Listen. - How many rounds do you have left? - Michael. You've seen the airport. There is no cover. It's crawling with armed soldiers and there are civilians everywhere. If we go in hot, we'll be dead before you know it. - We've handled worse. - Not without support and you're injured. I'm not letting him go. Not when he's this close. He's gone. For now. I swear I will help you find him again. We will get him. I think I should drive. Fine. Michael! Michael, don't do this. It's suicide. That's why I have to do it alone. Michael? Michael! - What's the last thing you remember? - I told you. I came in, Alex was snooping around on my computer. I called security. That's when she stuck me. - Nothing else? - No. It's just we've heard a different version of events. Alex? Tell us again. I came in to get my wrist checked and he... He grabbed me and he said that no one had to know. And I couldn't do anything because of my wrist. You can't possibly believe her. - She has a witness. - Who? I heard noises. - When I came, he was on top of her. - What is this? - I hit him with the tranq. - He said if I said anything... ...I'd get in trouble. Jaden finally convinced me to speak up. Oh, come on. Percy... If these two are on the same page, it has to be true. This is absurd. She's lying, I didn't do anything. Percy. Percy, I swear. I'm telling the truth... Percy. Sorry. - Destination? - Yemen. The next flight departs in a half hour. Okay, I'll take that. Round trip or one way? Sir, round trip or one way? One way. Michael, don't do this. The way those soldiers are stacked, you will not get within 10 yards... ...before they cut you down. Who'd have thought you'd be the voice of reason? Revenge is not the answer. - Excuse me, is this Nikita talking? - That's different. - I'm not throwing my life away. - That's your choice, this is mine. I hope you find what you're looking for. Shut up. You don't get to say your goodbyes. Goodbye, Nikita. Michael, Michael. Listen, listen to me, Michael. You think you don't have anything to live for? You do. You have me. Michael. No! No! Every man has a choice. His life and his character are determined by the choices he makes. You have options. - Do I know you? - No, but I know you. Young, smart, ambitious, which is why I'd like you to come work for me. No, thanks. Really? You don't wanna get Kasim? Do you know where he is? We can find him. What are you, the CIA? No, nothing that obvious. We don't have to deal with the red tape the other agencies are burdened with. Nor do we have their restrictions. Get even. Get justice. For yourself and your country. Come work for me at Division. - Thank you for the extraction. - It wasn't easy. You did make a bit of a mess of things. I know you sent in the strike team and I know you couldn't tell me about it. I don't blame you because you were right about Nikita. I never should've trusted her. She probably said she was doing it for your own good. I bet she even believes that. - I almost had him. - You'll get him. And when you do, I will be the one who helps you. At least one good thing came out of all this. Now you know who your real friends are. Yes, sir. @ http://thepiratebay.sx/user/Zen_Bud
