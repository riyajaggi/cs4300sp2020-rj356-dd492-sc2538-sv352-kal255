 ANNA: Hey, Yoshi. [BARKS] All right, all right. I'll be there in a second. Hey, Yosh. Hm? You miss him too, huh? [whimpers] You wanna go outside? Go outsidey. Come on. [whimpering] In a minute, Yosh. [YOSHI BARKING]

 ANNA: Calm down. I'm almost ready. [YOSHI WHIMPERING] [TIRES SCREECHING] And how did you leave the scene? I tossed the room. I took the money from the purse. THOM: It will look like a robbery. MICHAEL: That's good. You eliminated a security threat to our country. And you successfully completed your training. [YOSHI WHIMPERS] Thom... ...you're an agent now. COMPUTER: Intel on target was solid. -I know. I wasn't fast enough.

 It doesn't make sense. They made it look like a home invasion. No questions asked. Call the police. Have them ask. No. Division doesn't know I'm involved yet. I wanna use that against them. -Thom? -Hey. Yeah, I was just, uh .... I was just waiting for you. I just wanted to say goodbye. What do you mean? I mean I'm moving out of here. Moving up. I graduated. I'm a field agent as of tonight. Well, don't get too excited. So that means you had to .... -Tonight? -Yeah. Cool. -"Cool"? That's all you're gonna say? -What do you want me to say? -I don't know. Congratulations? -Congratulations. [Door SLAMS] Hey, Yoshi. Where's Mario? Oh, thank you. Hey, is there anything you wanna tell me about your owner that I don't know? Hm? All I got is Anna Harcourt... ...twenty-five years old... ...born in Bethesda... ...graduated George Washington University, 2009... ...bachelor's degree in Baltic-Slavic languages. Mm. [IN POLISH] [IN RUSSIAN] [IN CZECH] [whimpers] [IN ENGLISH] I thought so. Let's see what was on your camera. Young intern in Washington gets to meet a lot of people. Low-level intern with no access. Why did they kill you? Hey, Yoshi? You recognize this guy? [YOSHI BARKS] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] You make a mojito? Tough order for a dive. Lucky you found a star bartender. It will take a sec. Good. We can talk while you work. Justice Department? Doing background checks on our employees. Your girlfriend, Anna. Ex-girlfriend. She in trouble? Like I said, just doing background checks. Standard for anyone applying for this level of clearance. Well, you probably know more than me. Don't know much about her background. -Broke up before I could meet her folks. -How long were you together? -Five months, two weeks, three days. -How many hours and seconds? [OLIVER LAUGHS] Actually, it was probably around 11 p.m. Right when my shift started. She teased me about my tats, I teased her about her power suit. -We just hit it off. -So why'd you guys break up? Her job. She was always stressed about it. The last time I saw her was about a week ago. She came by, I could tell she'd been crying. Said she had something she needed to tell me. I said, "Anna, you've had something you've needed to tell me since we met. Just say it already." But she couldn't. Uh, said that I wouldn't understand. And then I said something back... ...and she just left. That's it? Really? She was upset, so I followed her. Figured she'd head home... ...but she went downtown instead. I watched her walk into one of those private clubs near Capitol Hill. Way above her paygrade. So there was someone else. You ever confront her about it? She wants someone more connected... ...someone from the same world as her, that's fine. I just wish she would've told the truth. Do you remember the address of the club? [CAR APPROACHING] [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Is anyone here? Hello? Relax, Jack. Regal House is as private as it gets. You should know that better than anyone. JACK: I don't know why it's necessary to come back here. You had solved the problem. PERCY: This isn't me and you... ...sneaking sorority girls into the dorm anymore, Jack. You're a U.S. senator now. We have to get rid of all the evidence. That's what my friend here does. You tell him which rooms you did the dirty things in... ...and he'll clean them up. We, uh .... We usually had drinks down here, then we would move upstairs. The guest bedroom. First door on the left. So the conference room and the bedroom. No debriefings in the executive office? Percy, please. I just want this to go away. PERCY: Any connection between you and Anna Harcourt will be erased. In two days, D.C. police will find the body... ...a victim of a senseless home invasion. End of story. Hate to be the guy that does a favor then asks for one in return... ...but that new intelligence hill... ...the one with 55 million in black-budget earmarks? I need that to pass. It's five votes short. That's why we got you the chairmanship. I want you to call a meeting, all the Senators in your committee. Tomorrow night. Turn on the beltway charm and convince them to vote yes. JACK: Well, I suppose it's the least I can do. The very least. [CLATTERING] [NIKITA GRUNTS] -What? BIRKHOFF: Uh, the target from yesterday? -She's still dead, right? -What? Because she just clocked into work. Key card for Anna Harcourt... ...has her getting off on the fourth floor right now. Did the police find the girl's body? Got nothing from 911, so .... How the hell did she know? How does she know anything? She knows our protocol. And that we would have flagged that key card. I want the laptop from Harccurt's apartment scanned... ...and I want a strike team sent out to D.C. now. MAN 1: Hey. You're not Anna. -I know. -Am I gonna have to call Security? I'm three floors up. Anna is sick. I'm just getting her files. She never mentioned you. That is probably because she doesn't like talking to you. Ha, ha. Whoa, hey, hey. Play nice or I'm not gonna take your number when you give it to me. MAN 2: Chip, doughnuts are here. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone. Just sent Nikita's face to building security. Michael is en route with the strike team, ETA two minutes. Initial sweep of Anna's laptop. Techs were going over her calendar and, uh .... Whoa. Surprise. [LINE RINGING] WOMAN: Dr. Reed's office. Hi, it's Anna Harcourt. Did I owe you guys a call? Oh, hi, Anna. Let me get the doctor. DOCTOR: Hi. How are you feeling? -Fine. I think? -Nausea subsided? -No. -Well, look, it's nothing to worry about. Completely normal for the beginning of the first trimester. -Uh, Anna? Are you all right? -Yeah. The father is gonna be surprised. Oh, well, the results of the paternity test aren't in yet. MAN 1: Excuse me, folks. MAN 2: Down on the left. NIKITA: Hey, Chip. -Whoa, hey, easy. You gonna buy me a drink first? MAN 3: The other hall. Notify Control. -Hey, wait, is that permanent marker? -It is if you're lucky. [ELEVATOR DINGS] Location. Sixth floor. [LINE RINGING] OPERATOR: 911, what's your emergency? I heard my neighbor screaming. 926 Arbor Street. Please send someone. [MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] MAN 1: Wait up. MAN 2: Down the stairs. She just moved down to Floor 3. Huh. 911 just dispatched cops to check in on a disturbance at Anna's apartment. -Nikita called it in. -Why? She's doing our job for us. It was before we knew the girl was pregnant. Cops find the body, run an autopsy. Linking the baby's DNA to Senator Kerrigan. Smart, Nikki. Not smart enough. Always have a back-up plan. Got her. Conference room, first floor. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] All right. Nobody move. Who was the last one in here? Who? I was. -Where's your key card? -In my pocket. COP 1: Hello? Hello? [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Hello? COP 2: Hello? Hello? Anybody here? -I'm all clear. -Yeah, I got nothing back here. Excuse me, sir. You heard any screams in the past five minutes? Haven't heard a thing. Thank you, sir. [grunting] [KNOCK ON DOOR] Yeah? All that training and they never taught you a Windsor? I knew how to do this before without even looking. [sighs] Before Division. First, jacket off. -I'm sorry about before. -it's okay. They said she was a security threat. They wouldn't have put a hit on someone if they weren't sure. [THOM SIGHS] But you're not sure. She saw me. Right before I pulled the trigger, she turned and saw me. She saw my gun and she didn't even scream. [sighs] I just don't know why she didn't scream. MRS. HARCOURT: How do you know Anna? Well .... -You work with her? -No. -Then you're friends? -Not exactly. I don't understand. It's hard to explain. Well, maybe you should explain why you're here? Otherwise I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. Anna's dead. -We haven't heard from anyone. -I'm calling Anna now. [LINE RINGING] The police haven't called. Nobody. Honey, she's not answering. You won't hear from the police. The people who did this are above the law. -What does that mean, "above the law"? -When did this happen? Anna was pregnant... ...by a man she knew, a U.S. senator. His name is Jack Kerrigan. He didn't want the affair to go public, so he had her killed. What... ? Listen, I want to help you get justice for Anna... ...but I need your help. She may have had a prenatal paternity test done. If She did... ...DNA from the test would prove the affair. The doctors might allow you... ...her parents, access to those results. But we need to hurry, okay? The people who did this are thinking the same thing and they're probably...  [IN RUSSIAN] [IN RUSSIAN] [ALL GRUNTING] [MRS. HARCOURT YELLS] [MR. HARCOURT SPEAKING IN RUSSIAN] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [IN ENGLISH] I thought she was FBI, but the way she fights .... Look what she did to Irena. You made a mess. Ask me. -Ask you what? -Who I work for. You're wondering. Oh, when I get started on you, I won't have to ask you anything. Because you're just gonna tell me everything I want to know. You guys should consider using more than one photo. So Anna was spying on Senator Kerrigan. Her parents were her handlers and you work for Gogol. "Gogol"? You mean like the search engine? No, like the Russian mercenary company... ...of which you are a highly ranked member, Ari Tasarov. Former KGB, drafted by the GRU in '95... ...went private with Gogol in '97 after the Russian economy boomed. -You buy one of my trading cards? -You were my target once. '06. -Division tried to kill me in '06? -Ankara. Basketball game. Kayseri Stadium, up at the catwalks. Why didn't you take the shot? Because your 8-year-old son was sitting next to you. A killer with a conscience. [whispers] it's no wonder they cut you loose. You should know two things. First... ...if your handler used a non-secure line, Division already knows you're in town. [IN NORMAL VOICE] He's already been chastised. Second thing? Before you pull the trigger, you should know my name. MR. HARCOURT [IN RUSSIAN]: All right. This is the handler whose data we intercepted. This is the one being handled: An agent known as Anna Harcourt... ...assigned to seduce and spy on a United States senator. Fortunately, we were able to take her out of the equation two nights ago. This is her boss, Ari Tasarov... ...a high-ranking member of Gogol. I suspect his retaliation will be to terminate Gogol's original target... ...Senator Jack Kerrigan. We cannot let that happen. You have your orders. Kerrigan's our strongest ally in the Senate and someone I trust. -it's a rare combination. -Why not call off the meeting tonight? Because $55 million in funding is at stake. He's getting us the votes we need. We're not gonna disturb that meeting. And Ari is gonna take out the senator? That's what I would do if I were him. It's the rules of the game. So you're Nikita? You should've said so to begin with. Percy sent you to kill me four years ago? I gotta tell you, that's a bit of an ego boost. Then allow me to humble you. Your info tap on Senator Kerrigan died with Anna. You know, I think Division did us a favor there. Anna got sloppy, fell in love with a civilian. Bartender. Same as you, if the rumors are true. What is it with female operatives that draws them to weak... ...easily manipulated men? You're very lucky that I am tied up right now. I don't doubt it. It's that rage that makes you perfect for this. -Perfect for what? -Rules of the game. Percy destroyed our asset, so now I'm going to destroy his. Senator Kerrigan dies tonight. You kill a U.S. senator, you start a war. That's why we're going to outsource the job. To who? To a rogue American spy... ...seeking revenge against the government that created her. Kalitrol-226. Nasty little toxin. Developed by Division, we reverse-engineered it. In 12 hours, a chemical will start a chain reaction... ...that will liquefy your stomach. You get the antitoxin when the senators dead. Go to hell. That could be salt water for all I know. Oh. Go ahead. Have it tested. I'm not working for you. You don't have a choice, Nikita. Because you can't just walk into Division... ...and grab the antitoxin. You don't have enough time to get it manufactured. So the only way you go on living is to play nice and obey. Because if we walk out that door, you will never see us again. Hm? Oh, well. Wait. My tools, my way. Corner of 6th and Radcliff. Eight o'clock. Vladamir will meet you there. COMPUTER: You have to do what Gogol says. -No, I don't. -Then you'll die. Not if you get the antitoxin. it's in Medical. Somewhere. it's a pill. If the toxin is in a red bottle, the antitoxin will be green. If the toxin is black, the antitoxin...  Not possible. Medical lockdown, 24/7. Alex, there is no other way. Michael will be activated on the op. Plant the pill on him. If you don't do this, I'm dead. I won't let you down. [BOTH GRUNTING] Damn. No. I want in. [BOTH GRUNTING] [ALEX PANTING] Is that all you got? Chill. [ALEX Yells] [GROANS] DOCTOR: I still think it's just bruising. I'll get some anti-inflammatory cream. That should do it. It's more than just a bruise. I'm telling you, look at it again. How'S that? [GROANS] Well, it might be a fracture. Might be? Can't you be more thorough? It hurts. I'm not faking this. Fine. I'll go set up the x-ray. Wait here. Just don't move. [Grunts] Damn it. THOM: Hey. I heard you broke your wrist. No, I'm fine. Did Michael leave already? Uh, he's heading up a protection detail. We're guarding a U.S. senator. ....We..? -Yeah. I was guarding the senator too. I just didn't know about it. Hey. The girl I killed was a Russian spy. So she wasn't innocent. This is real, huh? You're gonna be going out there on missions from now on. Yeah, that's the plan. Um .... Be careful. I will. [Door OPENS] [PHONE BEEPS] Now I'm your handler. Get in. This is how I monitor you. Check, check. Big Russian bear has a Boo Boo. You gonna wear that? Be easier if you went in wearing next to nothing. Vladamir... ...if I need mission advice, I'll ask a real agent. Okay. Perimeter protection only. We've got men guarding the entrances. The rooftops are secure. If you see anything suspicious... ...call it in first. [CROWD CHATTERING] Clear. Clear. [grunting] NIKITA: You wanna live? Do what I say. AGENT 1 [OVER RADIO]: Station three. [STATIC CRACKLING] -Go ahead. -I've got an SUV, someone inside. Looks like monitoring equipment. Thought I saw movement. -Possible armed agents. -Keep your eyes on it. Ari's men are already outside. Bring the senator in here discreetly. Let's go. AGENT 2 [OVER RADIO]: South perimeter clear. THOM: We've extracted the senator and are moving him to the kitchen. What the hell is going on? This is just a precaution, senator. I'm sure it's nothing. [BOTH GRUNTING] Oh, hey. I remember you. Bathroom at the Wyckland Hotel. Yeah. I owe you one. -Feeling cocky in that suit? -We're gonna stand here. And when I don't check in, backup will come. You know what? You're right. [ALL GRUNTING] Now you owe me twice. Congratulations, by the way. NIKITA [OVER RADIO]: Your turn. Get up. Please, I'm begging you. You killed someone and that someone had friends. Forward agents down. There may he one more out there. Be on the lookout. -Hey, listen to this. -What is it? NIKITA: You're gonna listen. JACK: Please don't. -Please. Please, don't. -Turn around. The senator. Who else? -Turn around! -No, please. Nikita's inside. She's got him. Move. Move! Listen, I didn't know they were gonna kill her. You lie! I know how far you and Percy go back. NIKITA: You knew. How many other girls were there? JACK: They were grown-ups. They knew what they were getting into. Except this one was a Russian spy and you finally got bitten in the ass. I didn't know she was a spy and she was pregnant. -Would that have made a difference? -Please, don't. -Turn around. Turn around! -Please, don't. Please, don't. [JACK SOBBING] Please, don't. Perimeter, check in. Now. AGENT 1: North and east side secure. AGENT 2: South and west side secure. Then she's still here. [WOMAN LAUGHING] [Door OPENS] MAN: But there is true evil in the world. Moral authority demands...  Moral authority? Based on what? Where you happened to be born or what you happen to be born with? You're not trying to understand society... ...from your perch here at the Regal House? Seems a larger perspective may be in order. -Well, we're trying to do that. -Everyone thinks of changing the world... ...but no one thinks of changing himself. This must be the protection detail you told me about. Protection detail? To make sure we're not disturbed this evening. Senator, may I speak with you? Can it wait? Not really. -Is this the bodyguard you mentioned? -Bodyguard? The one who served his country. A true patriot. -Oh, where'd you serve, son? -Uh, all over. Um, Middle East, mostly. Korea. That was my war. You should swap stories. Should we get some air? -I really need to speak...  -Army or Marines? MICHAEL: Navy, actually. MAN: Oh. -Are you going to let me go? -I'm thinking about it. Excuse me. JACK: Oh, my God. NIKITA: Stay right there. JACK: Please! -Do we take her? She's got a senator as a body shield... ...and four more within earshot who have no idea what's going on. [ENGINE STARTS AND REVS] So, what do we do? We keep it that way. Get off! [TIRES SCREECHING] We know the audio file was leaked at around midnight last night. Voice analysts have confirmed that it is indeed Senator Kerrigan... ...admitting to an affair with a now-missing intern. He's expected to announce his resignation in the next few days. [MUTES AUDIO] That doesn't match up with what you said. Right now Kerrigan's people are doing damage control. But once the audio file comes out...  Everyone will know Anna the intern was Anna the spy. Won't be enough to save Kerrigan, though. He's done. You don't work for the Justice Department, do you? [Dog BARKS] Yoshi! Custody of the innocent bystander goes to you. Yeah. Just tell me one thing. Was there anything real about her or was I just, like, part of her cover? Oliver, you were the only thing that was real to her. Look, we all wear masks... ...everyone, every day... ...and sometimes we wear them so much... ...we forget who we really are. And sometimes, if we're lucky... ...someone comes along and shows us who we really wanna be. Who we should be. You were that for her. ARI: I'll call you back. We're not nervous? You wouldn't take me out here. it's not your style. See, that's what I love about you. Your instinct. You love me? I took out your agents and didn't let you get back at Percy. And you neutralized the toxin. How? Trade secret. Well, in the grand scheme of everything, you and me, it doesn't really matter. -There is no you and me. -Don't be so sure. We know about the black boxes. And you know Gogol would provide you with unlimited cash, weapons... ...safe houses all around the world. it's what you need to take them on. You tried to kill me. Oh, ancient history. It was last night. Rules of the game. Fighting this war on your own must be exhausting. All right, let's play this forward. I join you... ...we coordinate strikes, we find all the black boxes... ...we take down Division, then we put a bullet in Percy's head. -Then what? -You win. No, you take over. The bastard stepchild kills his father and then takes his place. Remember, I know where Gogol came from. Well... ...let's play forward another way. Division goes down, from you, from us... ...Gogol will come to power. It's inevitable. What's your play then? If it doesn't end with Division, when does it end? I'll let you know when I get there.
