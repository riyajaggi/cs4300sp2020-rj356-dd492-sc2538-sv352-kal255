 NIKITA: Six years ago, I was taken from prison... ...and forced to become an assassin for a black-ops program called Division... ...that has now gone rogue. With the help of Alex, my partner on the inside... ...we discovered the location of a black box. A hard drive that holds our government's secrets... ...and makes Percy and his Division untouchable. It was guarded by one of Division's deadliest. An assassin who killed my fiancé. I captured him, but he escaped. Now, on the run from Division, he has the black box.

 I'm going to get it back, and then I will take Percy and Division down. And the last word they'll breathe before the end will be my name. [BOTH GRUNTING] [MAN GRUNTS] Wait, wait, wait! - Wait, wait. - Owen? - What the hell are you doing here? - Had to make sure you weren't armed. - Who was I kidding? - What do you want? I started something. I need your help to finish it. Owen... ...what did you do? This is the situation in Chile right now. Widespread anti-American protests over the release of shocking video.

 You're about to see footage from a traffic camera. This car accident was thought to have killed Andrés Quintana... ...a candidate in Chile's recent presidential election. But this was no accident. BIRKHOFF: Brakes disengaged by hacking onboard system. We have visual. Please confirm target is down. Watch and listen as covert American operatives... ...reach into the car and asphyxiate Quintana... ...who had not died from his injuries. AGENT: We need to restrict his airway. [QUINTANA GRUNTING] Stand by. He's fighting it. [QUINTANA CHOKES] We're good. Tango down. WOMAN [ON TV]: "We're good," he says... ...and the world bears witness to the sanctioned murder... ...of a foreign political figure by the United States. FIEDLER: We just don't do this kind of blunt work anymore. Put it this way, I am not Ollie North and this is not 1986. We have no official word on who pulled this off... ...but cover your desks and stay vigilant. There will be retaliation against us. Who could have done this? A private contractor? - DOD? FIEDLER: There's no way to tell. Maybe it's Fletcher's ghost unit. FIEDLER: Excuse me? Fletcher? You got something? I have been tracking... ...off-book counterintel activity for three months. It started with the Mirko Dadich incident in New York. Subversion, infiltration. It all points to a single black-budget organization... ...funded and sanctioned from within our government. [MEN CHUCKLING] Right. I've been on desk rotation for almost a year. If I could get to Chile, I could find some trace of them. Someone they turned in Quintana's camp... ...local hires they made... - Who made? RYAN: I'm not sure. But these guys are everywhere and nowhere. Like... Like the dark matter of the universe. They fill all the empty spaces. Dark matter, heh. You know, we deal in facts, not science fiction. Better get back to work. NIKITA: Where the hell is it? The black box is in a safe place. Don't look at me like I'm some recruit. I'm in this fight as much as you are. - I shot across Percy's... - That's not all. There's a reason why I don't release operations to the press. First, there's chaos, then a cover-up. Someone will get framed for this. - Or did you not consider that? - I have a plan. Oh, I've heard that before. The video didn't come from the black box. The video came from this. Percy sends these to the Guardians and we use them to update the boxes. - Still not hearing a plan. - There is a Division scientist. Designation: Engineer. He built the boxes, he encrypted them, he set up the entire system. I released the video because if the system is compromised... - The engineer will come in and fix it. - Exactly. And when he does, it's our chance to locate the other six boxes. We do that, we take them out, and then we take out Percy. How did you think you were gonna get close to this engineer? That's why I came to you. He's gonna report to Division. You've got someone on the inside. [CELL PHONE RINGS] Hello, John, how is your day going? Don't you start with me. Oversight is not happy about this. Are you calling on behalf of them or that agency that writes your checks? Look, you exist because the group allows it. You and your Division are a tool of Oversight, you got that? It was a data breach. It's being dealt with. Division will remain invisible. Well, don't be so sure. I have a junior analyst... ...who's started a file. He's found your fingerprints all over the world. Lucky for you, I denied his request to go to Santiago. - Hey, are you listening to me? - Send him. Send him down there now. - Why would I do that? - He's not your problem. He's your patsy. Excuse me? Your patsy. Your Lee Harvey Oswald. Your Scooter Libby. Who's the guy that said he fathered John Edwards' kid? What are you suggesting? I'm not suggesting anything. I'm telling you. We're gonna control the narrative on this. Division will create an electronic paper trail... ...that will paint your junior analyst as a political zealot... ...an anti-Quintana firebrand... ...determined to prevent a radical shift to the left in Latin America. What's his name again? Ryan Fletcher. You're gonna frame him for the assassination? No, John. You are. Remember? I'm just a tool. [BLEEPING] BIRKHOFF: Your assignment for today is to create an electronic paper trail. I want you all to pose as a political zealot online. Someone opposed to the policies of this man. Anybody know who this guy is? I didn't think so. Letting you kids watch cable news would only make you dumber. Browsers open! You made first strike alone... ...knowing you'd need my asset for follow-through. Why? You think I was gonna go along with your plan? I didn't think you'd help, all right? Not after what I did. Back at the pool when you saw it was me... ...part of you wanted to kill me. I don't blame you, Nikita. Stop. Division made me what I am and Percy put me in a cage... ...to guard his secrets. I had no idea what I was helping him do. - Until you came along. - Stop it. Stop. Help me. We can do this. If I do this... ...there's no "we." My operation, my rules. Say it. Your rules. [COMPUTER BEEPING] [COMPUTER KEYS CLACKING] Division is creating a paper trail... ...trying to paint someone as anti-Quintana. You were right. I never considered this kind of collateral damage. Actions have consequences that Division teaches you to ignore. First thing you have to learn is forget everything they taught you. - Do we know who they're framing? - I'll find out. All right. This engineer... ...what's he look like? He's like 40, 45, weird... ...glasses, kind of eccentric. - Weird... - I got it. Engineer? You're supposed to work on the assignment. I got a new one. Burying you. Isn't that the old one? I have a picture of you trying to escape Division. Remember? Nothing lasts forever. Not even a picture. I got something. Division is linking this trail to the same I.P. Address every time. Pinged at a home Wi-Fi, belongs to Ryan Fletcher of Alexandria. Oh, here we go. He consults for an import-export company. Madrazo lmports. Offices in Virginia and Santiago, Chile. OWEN: Lmport-export? That seems a little like a little CIA front. Framing a company man. A bold stroke. [MAN SPEAKING IN SPANISH ON MONITOR] [DOOR BUZZING] [COMPUTER TURNS OFF] Fletcher. They told me you were coming. This place is blowing up. What did you do to get this gig? - Must have been something I said. - Times like this... ...I'm glad to be down here keeping watch. - Why is that? - After it hits the fan... ...it keeps going. Right past me to you. That's beautiful, Gil. It's deep. Your desk is just the way you left it. [PHONE RINGING] GIL: Cleary. Fletcher, there's already a call for you. On two. - Ryan Fletcher. - Listen to me very carefully. Who is this? You're being framed for murder. - What? - I have credible intelligence... ...from an active mission to compromise you. Who is this? I'm a friend. Ryan, listen to me... ...sever ties and go to ground immediately. Wait, I'm not doing anything until you tell me who you are... ...and how you know who I am. [GUNSHOTS] Ryan? [CROWD SCREAMING] Ryan, can you hear me? Ryan? [IN SPANISH] Navaja! Navaja! All right. The hell are you doing? What does it look like? I'm going with you. WOMAN [OVER TV]: As the world reacts to the assassination... ...of a political figure by the United States... ...the protests in Chile have escalated... ...to full-scale geopolitical chaos. I thought we taught Nikita better than this. MICHAEL: I'm not sure putting us on the news was her play. I paid a visit to the owner of the leaked site who posted the video. - He talked? - After some persuasion... ...he gave up his sources. I was right. - Owen? - Mm-hm. So he is alive. And now Nikita has a partner. Any mention of the black box? No. Apparently he uploaded the video from a thumb drive. Can't believe Nikita is getting involved in all this chaos it's causing. I suppose if it serves her mission to bring down Division. She's all about herself, Michael. You should know better than anybody after what happened in Tashkent. WOMAN [OVER TV]: And we are just getting this. Ryan Fletcher, CIA operations officer... ...has been linked to the Quintana assassination in Chile. Fletcher is not under covert status with the agency... ...and therefore can be named publicly. - You framed a CIA agent? - Well, he wasn't under covert status. He was a punk analyst... ...who stepped out of line and needed to be put in place. The rebels will squeeze a confession out... ...post it, and by the time it's been re-tweeted around the world... ...he will have assumed room temperature... ...and the scandal will have blown over. - If she's involved, she's seen this. She'll try to save the agent. Bring your best team. If those two are working together, they're gonna be hard to stop. Whoa, whoa! Close the door. Wait here. I've got credentials. I'll tell them Langley sent me to follow up. All I have to do is cross-reference his alias... ...find the location and an ID number. - Is there a problem? - You lost me at "Wait here." I have credentials, you don't. That makes you backup. Got it? You're used to working on your own, huh? Kind of just get right in there... ...direct offense. Solo, right? - Do you know what I'm not used to? Sitting outside a building and talking about how I'm gonna infiltrate it. When I do something, I just get in there... Yeah. - Wait here. - Yeah. Welcome to Santiago, Miss Jordan. Thank you. Ryan was using that desk there. We're all cleared out. - You looking for anything in particular? - Rebels. You must have intel on their local camps. Hola, Navaja. Thanks. That's funny. Langley didn't say anything about you coming down. That's because they didn't know. The director asked me personally. Really? Because you know what I think? I think that you... Somebody call for backup? [POUNDING] Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. NAVAJA: Quiet! - I... Tell the world what you did for your country. I swear to you, the CIA did not sanction this. Look, why me? You could've taken anyone. All of us. But you came for me? Why? Please, wait. I want the same thing as you do. I wanna find out who did this. [IN SPANISH] JADEN: Where are you going? - We're supposed to be sparring. - I didn't sign up with you. I signed up with you. We're besties now, remember? BIRKHOFF: Just "Engineer"? ENGINEER: It's too cold in here. You're hoarding gear, not sides of beef. BIRKHOFF: Yeah, that's how I roll. Hey, don't touch that. Look, what's this about? Percy told me I was gonna fix a data breach. Okay, If you won't tell me your name, tell me what you're engineer of. Apparently, your future. [DOOR OPENS] Gentlemen. I brought you here... ...because I was promised a secure... ...self-contained storage system. And now I find there's a hole in Pandora's box. ENGINEER: First off, it ain't Pandora's box, it's mine. Second, my system is flawless... ...and my encryption is exquisitely impervious. The only failure is the human element. Those Guardians, which you brought into the mix... The Guardians are fine. The breach was caused by the update drives... ...which last time I checked were part of your system. Why do you even need that? This thing's got onboard wireless. PERCY: Exactly. See, Birkhoff here is a signals expert. Now, I want the two of you to take this out of the equation. Update the black boxes wirelessly... ...without hurting the encryption. - I love a challenge. - I've never seen one of these before. - What clearance level is this? - My level. Today's the day you reach your full potential, Birkhoff. Don't let me down. Amazing. You already look lost. Put that away. This isn't a cleaner job. Sorry. It's okay. I'm new at this hero stuff. - You've been doing it a lot longer. - I'm not a hero, Owen. If we go in hot, we put Fletcher in the crossfire. - Nonlethal whenever possible. Got it? - Yeah. [IN SPANISH] Good evening. I have a statement from the president. There will be no questions afterward. [MAN 1 GRUNTS] MAN 2: Miguel? [GRUNTS] - Is that quiet enough? - Yeah. This administration vowed to uncover the truth about the events in Chile. So it is with a heavy heart that we confirm tonight... ...that one of our own... ...a CIA officer named Ryan Fletcher... ...has squandered his promise as our best and brightest. His zealotry... ...has led to the senseless death of Andrés Quintana. And this office will use everything in its power... ...to see him brought to justice. - Your President stole my thunder. - I... Oh, well. [GASPING] [GRUNTS] [MEN SHOUTING IN SPANISH] [IN SPANISH] [GASPS] OWEN: I'm out! - Who are you? - Nikita. You hung up on me. - Let's go. - Where? - Ryan... - I just watched myself get framed... ...and now you two show up? - I warned you. Who did this? You know about the black-ops group? Let's just get you out of here. We'll talk later. [GUNFIRE] There's more of them. Those aren't rebel guns. - Who's out there? - Wanted black-ops? You got it. Nikita, you're surrounded! It's over. Nikita! There's no way out. He's right. The only way out is through the forest. We'd be totally exposed and running for days. We could blow up that truck, create a diversion, and flank them. Or we can be smarter. Hide in the forest, pop them off one by one. We tried quiet. - It didn't work. - Who are you again? Forest. They're on the move. Let's go! Go! Go! [SIGHS] [COMPUTER SWITCHES OFF] What a mess. It's a sign of genius. Not this. This. I got a lot on my mind. It's not every day Lord Sauron steps down from Mt. Doom... ...and asks you to forge the One Ring. Damn it. No way this codec is ever gonna fit the satellite bandwidth. Quantum key distribution is too sophisticated. You sure you wrote this? Are you sure you're not someone else? Percy says he plucked you from obscurity... ...that you're a diamond in the rough. BIRKHOFF: Well, that's very cute... ...but I am not a Spice Girl. And I was never, ever, obscure. I was elusive. And a little dangerous. - I was a legend. ENGINEER: Ah, yeah. ShadowWalker. Caused a little craziness at the Pentagon back in the day. - I was making a statement. - But Sauron captured you. And... ...now what? Well, are you still a legend? [GUNFIRE] GIL: Freeze! United States Army. Drop your weapons. Hands up! You too, Ryan. - Gil. - Now! I don't think escape is an option. Not at 30,000 feet. If this was a Division job... ...they'd be sending me in right now with a couple of briefcases full of acid. I'm pretty sure that's what's waiting for us on the ground. OWEN: Even if I could slip these cuffs, I don't see a way out of here. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I do. My rules, remember? Say it. Your rules. RYAN: The rebels could've taken anyone. - They took me. - You don't know that. Oh, come on, Gil. The White House spokesman called me out on TV... ...a few hours after I was grabbed. This was a coordinated campaign... ...that was to end with me in the grave. What do you want? I wanna talk to them. - Absolutely not. You're a prisoner. - How long have you known me, Gil? You really think that I would betray my country? I am trying to find the group behind the assassination. Those two represent the only concrete evidence... ...I have ever come close to finding. They're also the only shot I got at clearing my name. - Situation is being contained, John. FIELDER: How? There are two operatives and Ryan Fletcher on that plane. That kid is squeaky-clean and practiced in the art of pain-in-the-ass. He will go public. I'll handle it. Well, Oversight does not share your confidence, Percy. The group is weighing options as we speak. If that plane lands, that is game over for Division... ...and for you. You remind Oversight that I'm still in possession of all their dirty laundry. I'll decide when it's game over. ANNOUNCER: Finish him! SCORPION: Get over here! Aahh! ANNOUNCER: Scorpion wins. How is that even possible? ENGINEER: Killer instinct. You can't survive without it in this place. Present the problem again. Quickly. Uh... I... I got rid of the flash drive... ...but your encryption is too robust... ...for the bandwidth. - Why? I don't know. This thing's got a white-fi emitter not even in the real world yet. But it is an emitter... ...so that means it's designed to broadcast. So if I shut off that functionality... ...during download... Whoo! Yes! Ha, ha, ha! It frees the mind. It's switching back to broadcast mode. These thing is programmed to upload... ...to news servers all over the world. - Yes. But only after the Guardians receive the order to broadcast. - Percy has the only trigger, right? - No. [WHISPERS] Percy is the trigger. ENGINEER: Ah-ha! Ladies and gentlemen... ...ShadowWalker. [BOTH LAUGHING] BIRKHOFF: Thanks, by the way. For your help with everything. Problem solved? I hope so. I need one thing to work out today. ENGINEER: Excellent. BIRKHOFF: Yeah. Uh, gangbusters. You satisfied? ENGINEER: Yeah. The kid was his own worst enemy, but he gets it. PERCY: You've given him all the encryptions? - He knows them better than me. PERCY: Good. First box I wanna test is in London. - Let's uplink from operations. ENGINEER: That should really be easy... ...because this kid is... [BONES SNAP AND ENGINEER YELLS] Oh, my God. My God, what did you do? I promoted you. Now go. Be brilliant. Go on, I'll take care of this. [GASPING] Jaden. Who do you work for? I'm an independent contractor. The strike team that chased us. - Who were they? - Trained operatives. Most, assassins. RYAN: You're not answering my question. What organization? You've gone rogue from them, haven't you? Where are you from? - What? - Where were you born? St. Louis. Why? - Why'd you join the CIA? - I'm asking the questions. Did they recruit you? Signed up in college. Watched a bunch of James Bond movies? Wanted free dental? I had an older brother. Died in Afghanistan in '03. All right. This little exercise is over. Come on, kid. NIKITA: No. I'll talk. But only to you. Nikita, don't do this. We can't trust him. We're 30,000 feet in the air, nothing to look forward to on the ground. I have to trust someone. Let's talk. You really wanna go above your pay grade on this one, Gil? Because it's about to hit the fan. Five minutes. Bitch, I know it's in here somewhere. At least I got something. JADEN: Alex... Alex isn't in her room. I just think that she's up to something. Hey. I just had to get out of my room, you know? Couldn't sleep. RYAN: Division? Just Division. Pretentious, I know. How can they be allowed to exist? Well, they have secrets. Operation details on covert missions going back five administrations. Most of it the Oval Office never knew about. If this program is threatened in any way... ...the man who runs it will release those secrets. How much could he really have? Enough... ...to turn the world against us. Our own people against us. This program... ...it's a cancer, Ryan. We need to get rid of it without killing the patient. You can help. - How? - Help me find their co-conspirators. There is a group. I just... I don't know who they are, but they sanction Division. - What's in this for you? - What do you mean? What's your angle? There is no angle. Why did you and your partner go rogue? - We're not partners. - We are. We're trying to bring them down. Why? When I was there... ...I did a lot of things under orders. I engaged. On the black. Do you understand? Sins I can never repay. I don't know how to come back from that. Maybe bringing Division down... ...gets me one step closer. RYAN: Okay. If I do this... ...I'm gonna need proof. This is all the proof you'll need. We need one thing in return. Name it. Get us off this plane. I'll make sure that Cleary gets you protection on the ground. He means now. Before we land. Gil, something's wrong. He's not breathing. [OWEN GASPING] Wait! Don't move! - Drop it! Don't move! - Hey, hey, easy! [GRUNTING] Don't move! [ALARM BUZZING] Arm! Arm! We're good! You should've listened to me! I have no comment at this time. But trust me, I will. I should've blown that plane out of the sky when I had the chance. If you did that, we'd have no hope of finding the box. That was not an option. Now our problem is Fletcher. He's out in the open. Nothing we can do about that. We can ignore him... ...then control the narrative. [COMPUTER BEEPING] [KEYBOARD CLACKING] COMPUTER: All I got was the name of one city: London. Got it. See anything else? Yes. I saw what Percy is capable of. WOMAN [OVER TV]: John Fiedler, deputy CIA director... ...and a career officer of the agency... ...has been implicated as the mastermind of the assassination. Internal documents have surfaced... ...that show Fiedler tried to create a web history for Fletcher... ...to paint him as an anti-Quintana Zealot. Now, our producers have placed a call... [NIKITA SIGHS] This is me standing in the light. Ha, ha, good plan. OWEN: What did we get from the Engineer? There's a new one. Percy replaced the old one. Permanently. OWEN: Did we get anything? NIKITA: London. - When do we leave? - I have a few things to take care of. It's getting worse inside for my contact. If there's a Guardian in London, I'll know what to look for. I can advance it. Then call me. No more surprises. Oh. Told you it was safe. Shouldn't we talk to Ryan? There might be some secret we can use on that. Or not. One down, six to go. Seventh one is for Percy. Oh, uh... You were wrong, by the way. - Back at the camp, what you said. - About going in quiet? About you not being a hero. [English - US - SDH]
