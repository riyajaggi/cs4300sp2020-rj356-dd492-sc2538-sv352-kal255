SEE WHAT'S DOWN IN THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAN HERE. Paul: WE'VE PROBABLY GOT MORE GOLD THAN WE THOUGHT WE'D HAVE. PROBABLY SO. ANY GOLD AT ALL IS BETTER THAN NO GOLD AT ALL. MAN, THAT'S SOME NICE PICKERS IN THERE. LOOK AT THAT ONE. THAT'S GORGEOUS. YOU KNOW, A FEW OF THOSE AREN'T SMASHED VERY FLAT, YOU KNOW? NO, THEY'RE NOT, SO THAT JUST MEANS WE'RE REALLY CLOSE TO THE SOURCE. I THINK WE GOT A LOT MORE GOLD THAN WE THOUGHT WE DID. EVERYBODY SAYS, "OH, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GOLD." THE HELL IT AIN'T. WHEN YOU SEE THAT GOLD, YOU'LL GET EXCITED ABOUT IT. IT'S NICE. ALRIGHT. UP THE HILL WE GO. IS THAT GOLD READY YET? I'M GETTING AWFUL HUNGRY. HEY, FRED. WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN? THAT'S OUR FIRST CLEANUP, FRED. WOW. THAT'S ALL WE GOT. -OH, MAN. -IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD. Carlos: THAT'S REAL GOOD. YEAH. THAT'S IT. THAT'S SOME GOOD, CHUNKY GOLD. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. THAT IS IT. I WAS HOPING TO GET DOWN INTO A POCKET, AND FIND MAYBE 2 OR 3 OUNCES OUT OF IT. LOOK. WE GOT TWO DIVERS NOW. WE'RE RUNNING TWO MACHINES IN A GIANT PLUNGE POOL. COME ON. YOU'RE NOT COMPARING THE SAME THING. THAT'S A LOT BETTER THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA DO, FRED. WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT THIS WEIGHS. I'M CURIOUS. THIS IS JUST IN THE OVERBURDEN AND OFF THE TOP. -ALRIGHT. -LOOKS GOOD, MAN. Carlos: THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD. ALRIGHT, MAN. WE GOT ALMOST AN OUNCE. Narrator: DUSTIN AND HIS CREW HAVE BANKED NEARLY $1,400 WORTH OF GOLD -- A GOOD SIGN THAT THERE'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT DEEPER DOWN ON THE BEDROCK. LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM AND I BET THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE. -YEP. Wes: THAT'S A BETTER START THAN WE'VE EVER HAD. I MEAN... Fred: I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS GOT THAT. WE'RE GETTING BETTER AT THIS. WE'RE LEARNING. EVERY YEAR HOPEFULLY. SLOWLY. THAT FIRST CLEANOUT IS GETTING BIGGER AND BIGGER. THAT'S A GREAT FIRST CLEANUP. -AWESOME START. -HELL YEAH. -WE'RE WORKING ON IT. -ALRIGHT. Wes: WE'LL HIT IT HARD TOMORROW, BOYS. Fred: DUSTIN HAD A FABULOUS CLEANOUT. I'VE SEEN IN WHOLE SEASONS THAT WE JUST DIDN'T GET THAT MUCH GOLD. THEY'RE HITTING GOLD SOUNDS LIKE EVERY DAY, SO I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR THEM. ALMOST AN OUNCE ON OUR FIRST CLEANUP. YOU GOT TO REMEMBER. WE GOT THAT GOLD ON THE TOP LEVEL, SO WE'VE STILL GOT MANY, MANY, MANY FEET TO GO UNTIL WE HIT FRICKING BEDROCK. WHEN IT HITS BEDROCK, THAT'S WHERE OUR GOLD IS GONNA LOOK BEAUTIFUL, MAN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT JUST FLAKES LIKE WHAT WE GOT RIGHT NOW. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NUGGETS. Dustin: IT'S THE BEST WE'VE EVER DONE EVER. IT'S INCREDIBLE. A FULL...ALMOST A FULL OUNCE, AND WE'RE ON OUR WAY. THAT MEANS THERE'S GOLD IN THIS HOLE. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DIG IT. WE'RE GONNA HIT THE BOTTOM, AND HOPEFULLY WITH ANY LUCK, THERE'S GONNA BE HUNDREDS OF OUNCES INSTEAD OF AN OUNCE OR 10 OUNCES OR 20 OUNCES. HUNDREDS IS WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S DOWN THERE. ♪ -YOU READY? -GO. Dustin: WOO-HOO-HOO. Narrator: ON THE NEXT "GOLD RUSH: WHITE WATER"... HOW BAD DO YOU WANT TO BE HERE? I GET TO GO DIVING ON MY BIRTHDAY. [ LAUGHING ] Fred: JACKPOT! I HIT THE BOTTOM. Dustin: WE MUST BE CRAZY. -DIVER UP. DIVER UP. -WARMING UP. STEAM. Wes: COULD HAVE KILLED ANY ONE OF US. MINERS NOTHING. ALASKA ONE. COME LOOK IN THE BOX. -RAINING GOLD. -[ LAUGHS ] HELL YEAH! I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS LIKE THIS. Ryan: THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED.
