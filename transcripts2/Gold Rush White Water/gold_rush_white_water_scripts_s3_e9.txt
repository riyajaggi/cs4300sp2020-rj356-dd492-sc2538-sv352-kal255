 WE CAN'T LEAVE UNTIL WE GOT ALL THE GOLD. -[ LAUGHS ] -WE BROKE THE SCALE, DUDE. IT DOESN'T FEEL REAL. [ LAUGHS ] THANK YOU, WATERFALL! CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪♪ Narrator: AT RAINBOW'S END... Dustin: ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET IN THE WATER. ...2/3 OF THE WAY THROUGH THE SEASON, DUSTIN HURT HAS REACHED THE BOTTOM OF ONE OF THE MOST GOLD-RICH PLUNGE POOLS HE HAS EVER MINED. CARLOS. Carlos: YEAH? SUIT UP, BRO. WITH WINTER FAST APPROACHING, IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE FINAL PUSH. I WANT THIS HOLE TO BE DONE SO I CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PLACE, BUT I WANT TO GET ALL THE GOLD OUT OF IT. NOW, THIS IS THE TREASURE-HUNT PART. ♪♪ Narrator: 18 FEET DOWN, THEY'VE DREDGED BEDROCK ON ALL SIDES. NOW CARLOS CLEANS OUT THE LAST OF THE GRAVEL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOLE. Carlos: WHOA. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. I GOT A COLD. [ COUGHS ] THAT IS GONNA BE REAL WEIRD INSIDE OF A MASK. Carlos: AH. COME ON, GOLD. WHERE YOU AT, BROTHER? Narrator: DUSTIN WILL FOLLOW BEHIND TO MAKE SURE HE HAS EVERY LAST FLAKE OF GOLD. ARE YOU CLEARING THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING OR WHAT? AM I AT THE BOTTOM? YEAH. NO, MAN, I'M TRYING TO CLEAR OUT THIS WALL. Wes: WANT TO FINISH THAT HOLE UP SO WE CAN GET ALL THE GOLD OUT OF HERE? FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CAN'T FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHERE I'M AT RIGHT NOW. [ LAUGHS ] YOU'RE DOWNSTREAM. THIS BEDROCK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND. OH, WOW. THAT'S A ROCK. SO I NEED A HAMMER, A 1/2-INCH BOLT, A HAMMER DRILL, AND A CHAIN ON THAT BOLT. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ WHAT I THOUGHT WAS BEDROCK WAS NOT. IT WAS A BIG ROCK. -I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. -HOLY [BLEEP] ♪♪ Dustin: WHERE ARE THESE ROCKS COMING FROM? Carlos: [ LAUGHS ] JUST KEEPS GOING DOWN. I KEEP PULLING ROCKS OUT DOWN HERE. THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM -- RIGHT THERE. Carlos: OH. THERE'S A WHOLE NOTHER HOLE RIGHT DOWN THERE. YEAH, THAT'S COOL, MAN. IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER DIG SITE. YEAH, YEAH. WAY, WAY DOWN THERE. Narrator: 18 FEET DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PLUNGE POOL, DUSTIN HAS REMOVED A LARGE, FLAT BOULDER, REVEALING AN UNEXPECTED PIT IN THE BEDROCK. FULL OF BOULDERS AND GOLD-RICH MATERIAL, IT COULD HOLD A LIFE-CHANGING PAYOUT. THERE'S JUST ONE LITTLE SECTION, MAN. LIKE A HIDDEN BASEMENT. BUT IT'S JUST GOING DOWN. AND THAT PIT JUST KEEPS GOING DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. THAT MIGHT BE THE DEEPEST PART OF THIS HOLE. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE VERY LOWEST POINT OF THE HOLE COULD BE CHOCK-FULL OF GOLD. AWESOME. CAN'T ASK FOR TOO MUCH MORE THAN THAT. ♪♪ ♪♪ Man: GOT IT! -THERE YOU GO. YOU GOT IT. -THAT'S ONE BIG ROCK. Man #2: THAT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN I WAS EXPECTING. Man #3: YEAH. Narrator: A 1/4-MILE DOWN CREEK, DUSTIN'S FATHER, FRED HURT, HAS SO FAR MINED LESS THAN AN OUNCE OF GOLD. Fred: WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO DOWN HERE. A LOT. WE'RE REALLY COUNTING ON THIS WATERFALL. Narrator: BARELY A MONTH LEFT, HE'S FACING THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF THE SEASON -- THUNDER FALLS. Fred: WE GOT A LOT MOVED AND A LOT DONE. WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S IN THERE. Narrator: AFTER 3 MONTHS MINING SMALLER POOLS DOWNSTREAM, NOW AT THUNDER FALLS, FRED'S GAMBLED ON HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO GET DOWN TO WHAT COULD BE OVER 20 FEET TO BEDROCK, WHERE HE BELIEVES THERE'S A PILE OF GOLD NUGGETS WORTH MILLIONS. OH, ONCE IT'S IN THE BOTTOM OF SOMETHING, IT DOESN'T WANT TO COME BACK UP. WELL, ANYTIME ANYTHING HEAVY COMES DOWN THAT WATERFALL, IT CAN'T CLIMB. IF YOU CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GOLD, THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT. YOU LOOK FOR A PLACE THAT IT COULDN'T GET OUT OF. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DIVE UNDER A WATERFALL. THIS IS GONNA BE... IT'S GONNA BE REALLY EXCITING. I MEAN, IT MAKES THE PERFECT GOLD CATCH. THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY IS LOOKING FOR. YOU'RE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THAT PLUNGE POOL. I MEAN, IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THAT. Fred: ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET THIS EQUIPMENT RUNNING HERE. ♪♪ [ ENGINE STARTS ] THIS MOTOR'S STARTED. WHAT IN THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? IT DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT TO GO. YOU KNOW, WHOEVER IT IS OUT THERE STARTING IT HAS A HELL OF A TIME. Narrator: THE TWO MOTORS POWER THE DREDGE AND TWO VITAL LIFELINES FOR THE DIVER -- HOT WATER TO KEEP HIM WARM AND AIR TO BREATHE. [ ENGINE STARTS ] HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH THIS ENGINE FOR SOME REASON EVERY MORNING LATELY. [ ENGINE STOPS ] USUALLY, THESE MOTORS FIRE RIGHT UP FIRST PULL, BUT SOMETHING'S GOING ON WITH THAT SUCKER, AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS TO BE USING THEM LIKE THAT 'CAUSE IF IT DIES WHILE WE GOT A DIVER IN THE WATER, THAT DIVER'S IN TROUBLE. HEY, RYAN, I CAN'T GET IT GOING. [ ENGINE STARTS ] COME ON, BABY. SO, WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT? A PAIN IN THE BUTT, FOR SURE. YEAH. I'M FREEZING OUT HERE. DO WHAT YOU CAN DO. IT JUST DROPS OFF ABOUT A FOOT AND A HALF RIGHT THERE. Narrator: TO GET TO THE GOLD-RICH GRAVEL ON BEDROCK... ...THE CREW MUST REMOVE HUNDREDS OF TONS OF MASSIVE BOULDERS. THE DEEPER THEY GO, THE HEAVIER THEY GET. HOW'S THAT CURRENT TREATING YOU DOWN THERE, PAUL? YOU MUST BE DOWN PRETTY DEEP. IT'S NICE DOWN HERE ON THE BOTTOM. ALL RIGHT. STAY UP CLOSE TO THE WALL. DON'T GET TOO FAR AWAY RIGHT THERE. YEP. THERE'S A LOT OF BOULDERS, SO I'M JUST GETTING IN BETWEEN ALL THE BOULDERS THAT I CAN. ALL RIGHTY. I'M SITTING OVER HERE RIGHT ABOVE YOU RIGHT NOW. YEAH. AND IT SOUNDS LIKE THUNDER UP HERE. HA! HEY, FRED, I'VE GOT SOME ROCKS DOWN HERE THAT I MIGHT HAVE TO DRILL THESE THINGS. PUT SOME HANDLES ON THOSE THINGS, WE CAN GET THOSE THINGS OUT OF THERE. I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO USE A 10-FOOTER. LET ME FIND A GOOD ANGLE. CLEAR? YEAH. ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GIVE IT A LITTLE SHOT. GO FOR IT. WELL... ♪♪ AH. IT'S WALKING. YEAH. ♪♪ THE FACT IS, THE BOTTOM OF THAT WATERFALL IS FULL OF BOULDERS. SO LUCKILY, WE'VE GOT THAT 10-FOOT DRILL BIT. FRED CAME IN THERE, AND NOW HE'S DRILLING. PRETTY SOON, WE'LL BE PULLING THEM BOULDERS OUT OF THERE. ♪♪ ♪♪ UH-OH. IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU FINISHED. THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING, TOO. OH. -BROKE THE WELD ALREADY. -YEP. WE GOT ANOTHER BIT, THE OTHER 10-FOOTER? WE ONLY GOT ONE 10-FOOT, FRED. Narrator: THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE 10-FOOT EXTENSIONS AND THE 3/8 SHAFT THAT GOES IN THE DRILL CHUCK HAS FAILED. SO, WHAT HAPPENED WITH OUR DRILL BIT IS, OUR WELDING KIND OF BROKE. THESE DRILL BITS ARE HANDMADE, SO THEY USUALLY DON'T LAST THAT LONG. IS THERE SOMETHING STURDIER WE CAN MAKE THEM OUT OF? I'M NOT SURE. WE'RE OUT OF THE DRILLING BUSINESS. ♪♪ ♪♪ DUSTIN THOUGHT IT WAS FULL OF BEDROCK, BUT HE GOT AHOLD OF ANOTHER BIG, LARGE ROCK. SO IF WE'VE GOT A HOLE DOWN THERE THAT'S FULL OF GOLD, WE'RE HAPPY. Narrator: DEEP IN THE ALASKAN BACKCOUNTRY, DUSTIN HURT HAS ALREADY BANKED OVER 12 OUNCES OF GOLD FROM THE PLUNGE POOL AT RAINBOW'S END. NOW THE DISCOVERY OF A PIT IN THE BEDROCK COULD RESULT IN A WHOLE LOT MORE. WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP GOING AT IT, YOU KNOW? Narrator: THEY NEED TO REMOVE ANOTHER LAYER OF ROCKS TO GET TO THE GOLD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT. ♪♪ Dustin: BASKET COMING UP. ♪♪ ♪♪ [BLEEP] DAMN, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS, MAN! Wes: THAT'S FREAKING AMAZING, MAN! SO, WHAT'S THE BOTTOM OF THAT HOLE LOOKING LIKE? WELL, MAN, IT'S ALMOST POLISHED OFF HERE, MAN. Narrator: BOULDERS REMOVED, THEY CAN DREDGE THE GOLD-RICH GRAVEL. IT'S GETTING PRETTY CLOSE. I'M LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT NOW. YEAH, OKAY, YOU'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE DEEPEST AREA STILL. Carlos: IT LOOKS LIKE THERE'S GOLD. LIKE, LITTLE CRACKS, AND THERE'S GOLD. ♪♪ AND THIS THING IS STILL GOING DOWN IN THIS HOLE RIGHT HERE. IT'S STILL GOING DOWN.WHERE AT? THIS? RIGHT HERE. YEAH. THIS GOLD IS, LIKE, REALLY EMBEDDED IN THESE FREAKING CRACKS, MAN! I CAN SEE THAT THERE'S GOLD DOWN IN THIS CRACK, BUT I CAN'T GET TO IT. IT SEEMS LIKE THE GOLD'S STUCK DOWN IN THERE, AND WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THIS OUT OF HERE. WE CAN'T LEAVE ANY GOLD BEHIND. Narrator: NARROW CRACKS LINE THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT -- PERFECT GOLD CATCHES. BUT THE CRACKS ARE TOO NARROW AND TOO DEEP FOR THE DREDGE HOSE TO REACH THE HEAVY GOLD IN THE CREVICES. AFTER A 4-HOUR DIVE, DREDGING A PIT BELOW THE BEDROCK FLOOR, DUSTIN CHECKS THE SLUICE BOX. ONE BIG GOLD NUGGET. THAT'S IT. Wes: THAT'S IT, HUH? OKAY, TWOBIG GOLD NU-- THREE,OKAY. THERE'S A COUPLE. THAT'S THE BIGGEST ONE, THOUGH. FOR SURE. THAT'S PRETTY. AND IN THE DEEPEST CREVICES, THERE'S THE PROMISE OF EVEN MORE GOLD. Wes: THAT'S A REALLY NICE PIECE. AS LONG AS THEY CAN SPOT SOME CRACKS OR FISSURES IN THE BOTTOM, THEY'RE GONNA HAVE GOLD IN THEM. I COULDN'T GET THE GOLD TO COME OUT OF THE CRACKS AND THE CREVICES BECAUSE IT GOES DOWN INTO A DEEP POINT, RIGHT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. ANYBODY GOT ANY IDEAS? I THINK I CAN MAKE A LITTLE PIECE THAT WILL SUCK ON THERE WITH A 2-INCH HOSE COMING OFF OF IT AND PUT, LIKE, A PIPE ON THE END OF THAT, WHERE I CAN FLATTEN IT. VACUUM ATTACHMENTS. YEAH, YEAH, LIKE A NARROW VACUUM ATTACHMENT SO YOU CAN GET DOWN IN THE SIDE OF YOUR SEATS. YEAH.WE'LL USE EVERYTHING WE CAN BECAUSE THERE'S A WHOLE SECTION THAT I CAN'T GET INTO. WE GOT A LOT MORE WORK TO GO. YEAH. ♪♪ Narrator: 2 MILES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN AT McKINLEY CAMP... ...DUSTIN'S FATHER, FRED, ALSO NEEDS A BUSH FIX TO GET DOWN TO THE GOLD. THE WELDS HAVE BEEN BREAKING, SO WE PUT LONGER SHAFTS IN THERE THIS TIME USING A LONGER, OLD DRILL BIT. WE NEED THESE DRILL BITS. THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR JOB. VERY IMPORTANT WE GET THESE THINGS, AND GET THEM RIGHT. Narrator: THE CREW USES 10-FOOT DRILL EXTENSIONS TO BORE INTO ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DIVE PIT, BUT ON THE LAST DIVE, THE TIP GOT STUCK WHILE THE DRILL CONTINUED TO SPIN, BREAKING THE WELDS HOLDING THE DRILL BIT. FRED'S SOLUTION -- SWAP OUT THE SHORT BITS FOR LONGER BITS ND INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SUPPORTING WELDS. ♪♪ Fred: YEP, THAT'LL WORK. ♪♪ ♪♪ ALL RIGHT. OFF TO WORK. ♪♪ SUCCESS. HA HA! WHOO-HOO! ♪♪ WE'RE GONNA GET RYAN IN THE WATER. WE'VE GOT OUR 10-FOOT DRILL BITS READY, SO ONCE WE GET THEM DRILLED, GET SOME BOLTS IN THEM, GET THEM OUT, HE SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF MATERIAL DOWN THERE TO DREDGE, AND HOPEFULLY, HE'S GOT SOME GOLD IN THE BOX, TOO. YOU ALL READY, MAN? I'M READY. [ ENGINE SPUTTERING ] I DON'T WHY IT WOULD BE DOING THAT. [ ENGINE STARTS, SPUTTERS ] COME ON, BABY. IT JUST TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET IT GOING. [ ENGINE STARTS ] ♪♪ HOW YOU FEELING TODAY? FEELING GREAT. READY TO GET IN THERE AND MOVE SOME ROCKS. HOPEFULLY, OUR BIG DRILL BITS WORK OUT JUST FINE THIS TIME. I THINK THEY WILL BE. LET'S TRY TO CONCENTRATE ON GETTING THOSE BIGGEST ROCKS OUT OF THERE. GET SOME GOLD NOW, MAN.ALL RIGHT. YOU READY? YEP. YOU'RE THE MAN THERE, RYAN! I PUT YOUR LOOP ON THE BACK, SO EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OUT OF THE WAY, AND IT WON'T DRIFT IN FRONT OF YOU. ♪♪ GOOD LUCK, RYAN. THANK YOU.GOOD LUCK, RYAN. ♪♪ Narrator: FINALLY, THEY CAN GET BACK TO DRILLING THE MASSIVE ROCKS BLOCKING THEIR WAY TO BEDROCK GOLD. ♪♪ OKAY, RYAN, I'VE GOT THE DRILL BIT ABOVE THE WATER. I'LL LET YOU GUIDE IT WHERE YOU NEED IT. PUT IT DOWN TO HIS HAND. ♪♪ FEELS LIKE IT.YEP, SHE'S GOING. ♪♪ ♪♪ THAT'S GOT TO BE ABOUT 4 INCHES. THAT'S WAY DOWN IN THERE. IT IS WORKING. [ LAUGHS ] MAN, PAUL IS OUT THERE. HE'S DRILLING AWAY RIGHT NOW. WE'RE HOPING IT HOLDS UP. WE'VE PUT A LOT MORE WELD ONTO IT. Narrator: THE NEW WELDS HOLD. FRED'S CREW IS BACK IN BUSINESS. HEY, HAVE I GOT ENOUGH SLACK TO PULL THE HOOK? I'LL GIVE YOU ENOUGH SLACK TO PULL IT OUT. WE'VE GOT A BIG ROCK ON THE HOOK. WE'RE 5 TO 6 FEET. WHOO! ♪♪ BIG ROCK. THERE WE GO! ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT! THAT ROCK WAS HIDING SOME GOLD. I KNOW IT! [ BOTH LAUGH ] Paul: WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY GOOD SUCCESS WITH IT. WE GOT A BUNCH OF ROCKS DRILLED. THREE OR FOUR OF THEM DOWN THERE THAT WE WEREN'T ABLE TO GET LOOSE YET. SO RYAN'S TRYING TO DREDGE AROUND THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN GET THEM FREED UP. AND IF WE CAN GET THEM FREED UP, WE CAN GET THOSE PULLED OUT. I'LL NEED TO DRILL ANOTHER ROCK IF YOU CAN REACH IT. Ryan: OKAY.YEAH, WILL YOU LINK IT? GOOD MAN. LET ME FIND OUT WHERE MY HOSE IS HERE. ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: JUST AS THE CREW GAINS MOMENTUM, THEY HIT A MONSTER BOULDER. ♪♪ ONCE I LIFT IT STRAIGHT UP, AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. NOTHING?

WHAT THE HELL?WOW. SOMETHING IS WRONG. COME ON. COME ON THERE, ROCK. [BLEEP] DAMN. HEY, RYAN. COME ON UP. I'LL FINISH THIS BIG ROCK OFF. PULL THAT DUDE OUT OF THERE. UNFORTUNATELY, THEM ROCKS HAVE BEEN THERE SO LONG THAT THE SUCTION AND JUST THE CLAY AROUND THEM AND EVERYTHING'S HOLDING THEM IN THERE. SO WHILE THE DRILL BIT WORKS FANTASTIC, IT TAKES A LOT, A LOT OF WINCH TO PULL THEM THINGS FREE. TWO STEPS FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK. ♪♪ ♪♪ I'M SURE I'VE GOT ENOUGH STUFF TO MAKE THIS VACUUM-CLEANER ATTACHMENT. Narrator: EARLY MORNING AT McKINLEY CAMP. WES RICHARDSON FABRICATES A DEVICE TO SUCK UP THE LAST OF THE GOLD IN THE CRACKS OF THE BASEMENT AT RAINBOW'S END. I HAD TO GO DOWN TO PORCUPINE CREEK AND SCROUNGE AROUND. WE'VE GOT JUNK ALL OVER THE PLACE DOWN THERE. AND I FOUND MOST OF THE PIECES, I THINK, TO MAKE THIS APPARATUS. THEY'LL JUST GRAB THIS AND STICK IT RIGHT OVER THE END OF THE DREDGE MUZZLE, AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE THOSE SMALLER PIPES COMING OUT OF HERE NARROWED DOWN INTO, LIKE, A SQUARE SECTION LIKE THAT. SO IT CAN'T SUCK UP LARGE STUFF, BUT THEY CAN GET IT ON THOSE NUGGETS, AND IT'LL PICK THEM UP OUT OF THE BOTTOM. ♪♪ LOOK AT THIS THING.I'M JUST FINISHING IT UP.

DUSTIN'S FOUND MORE NUGGETS FROM RAINBOW'S END THAN ANY OTHER SEASON. AND A BASEMENT IN THE BEDROCK HAS REVEALED MORE PAY GRAVEL. SO BEFORE MOVING HIS OPERATION, HE WANTS TO GET EVERY LAST OUNCE OF GOLD. Dustin: WE'RE IN THE BASEMENT NOW. WE FOUND ANOTHER LAYER DOWN THAT WE THOUGHT WE HIT THE BOTTOM, BUT IT KEEPS GOING DOWN. CARLOS IS CALLING IT THE "BASEMENT" BECAUSE IT JUST KEEPS GOING COMPLETELY DOWN BELOW WHERE WE THOUGHT. WE'RE GONNA TRY OUT WES' NEW CREVICE TOOL, AND HOPEFULLY, IT'LL BE ABLE TO GET IN THERE AND JUST PULL EVERYTHING OUT OF THE CREVICE IN THERE.
