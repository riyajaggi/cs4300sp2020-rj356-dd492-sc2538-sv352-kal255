 MOST REMOTE  AND DANGEROUS CREEKS. HEY, GUYS!  RIGHT HERE. THIS IS OUR ENTIRE REASON  FOR BEING HERE, RIGHT HERE. SO YOU KNOW HOW THE CRACK  GOES ALL THE WAY DOWN, IF YOU WERE TRYING  TO BUILD A NUGGET TRAP, THIS IS WHAT  IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. I JUST BELIEVE IT'S GOING TO BE  CHOCK FULL OF GOLD, AND NOW WE NEED  TO CLEAN IT OUT. SO THE HOLE HAS TO GO FORWARD  IN ORDER TO DO THIS. WELL, I CAN'T WAIT  TO GET INTO THIS. MAN, THIS IS -- IT LOOKS LIKE  A GOOD DAY TO DIVE. Narrator:  LAST WEEK... ...DUSTIN DISCOVERED A CRACK  IN THE CREEK WALL... YEAH!  YES, IT IS! ...THAT GAVE THEM  THEIR BIGGEST CLEANUP YET. NOW WE'RE GETTING  INTO GOLD, BABY. NOW DUSTIN NEEDS HIS CREW TO DREDGE DOWN THROUGH THE ROCKS AND GRAVEL  TO THE PILE OF GOLD AT THE BOTTOM  OF THE BEDROCK CRACK. WE'RE THROWING THE DICE. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING FOR. THIS IS OUR FOCUS.  ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET TO WORK, GUYS. SO, TODAY, WE HAVE TO OPEN  THE HOLE UP MORE SO WE CAN GET DOWN  TO THE CRACK. THAT PROMISE OF THE POT OF GOLD  AT THE END OF THE RAINBOW, I THINK,  IS IN EVERY MAN'S HEART. THAT'S WHAT DRIVES YOU ON. SOME MEN HAVE MORE OF THAT DRIVE  THAN OTHERS. DUSTIN AND I HAVE GOT IT. Narrator: DUSTIN HAS INVESTED  $75,000 IN THIS SEASON. HE NEEDS IT TO PAY OFF,  OR HE'LL LOSE IT ALL, AND NONE OF HIS CREW  WILL GET PAID. Dustin:  I'M GOING TO GET THE GOLD  OUT OF THIS HOLE. Narrator:  DIVING ALONGSIDE HIM  IS RICH WEBSTER. I'M READY TO ROCK AND ROLL.  START GETTING BACK TO DIGGING, SEE IF WE CAN GET DOWN  TO SOME GOOD OLE YELLOW GOLD. Narrator:  AFTER 4 HOURS, DUSTIN AND RICH  ARE 12 FEET DOWN, JUST 3 FEET FROM BEDROCK. WHOA.  [BLEEP] WAS SCARY. I WAS [BLEEP] OUT OF AIR, DUDE. [BLEEP] THAT'S THE MOST SCARIEST THING  THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME DIVING.  -YEAH, I BET. Rich: THANK GOD YOU WERE  PULLING ME, DUDE, BECAUSE I COULDN'T  GET UP FAST ENOUGH. I WAS YANKING AS HARD  AS I COULD. THAT WAS GOOD BECAUSE I  WOULDN'T HAVE GOT OUT IN TIME. THAT THING SMASHED  AGAINST MY FACE SO HARD WHEN I WENT  TO TAKE A BREATH. PANICKED? I STARTED TO. I KNOW. CASEY SAVED MY ASS. HE SAVED MY ASS. YEAH, THAT WAS BAD.  -SORRY, MAN. GLAD I GOT YOU OUT.  -THANK YOU. THANK YOU. -I KNOW.  -I OWE YOU ONE. YOU'RE  ALL RIGHT, DUDE. Casey: THAT'S PROBABLY ONE OF  THE SCARIEST RESCUES WE'VE EVER HAD TO DO. HE STARTED TO PANIC DOWN THERE. THAT'S HOW DANGEROUS  THIS [BLEEP] IS. WE GOT TO CHECK  THAT POP-OFF VALVE. Narrator:  THE HOSE CLIP CONNECTING  THE AIR LINES TO THE COMPRESSOR HAS BLOWN. BEFORE ANYONE CAN DIVE AGAIN, WES SWITCHES IT OUT  FOR A THREADED BRASS COUPLING. Wes: YEAH. THIS IS THE LIFELINE  TO THE DIVER RIGHT NOW. WE CAN'T AFFORD FOR THIS HOSE  TO COME OFF OF THERE LIKE THAT. I'M GOING TO GIVE IT A SHOT  AND SQUEEZE IT DOWN SOME MORE. WE'LL RUN IT FOR A LITTLE BIT  AND SEE IF WE CAN GET IT TO CONTINUALLY RUN  WITHOUT POPPING UP. LUCKILY, WE JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE A TOOL HERE TO CRIMP THIS STUFF. SO I THINK I GOT THAT CRIMPED  TIGHT ENOUGH THAT MAYBE IT WILL STAY  ON HERE THIS TIME. I'M HOPING, ANYWAY. LET'S SEE IF THAT DOES THE TRICK  RIGHT THERE, A QUICK FIX. HOPEFULLY, THAT'S GOING  TO TAKE CARE OF IT. Rich: SO, FRED, IS IT BACK  WORKING AGAIN? Fred: IT'S  WORKING FINE. THE PRESSURE-RELIEF VALVE IS WORKING PERFECTLY. DID WE  DOUBLE-HOSE CLAMP THAT? YES.  I DID. AWESOME.  YOU'RE THE MAN. SORRY TO ASK. IT HAPPENED TO ME IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AT 80 FEET. I MADE IT TO WITHIN 5 FEET OF THE SURFACE BEFORE THE GUY SAYS, "OH, OKAY. HERE'S WHAT THE PROBLEM IS." ONE BREATH, AND THERE WAS NOTHING. BELIEVE ME.  I WAS COMING UP. I THINK THEY CALL THEM  NEAR-MISSES. SO I'M GOING  TO GO BACK DOWN. I'M GOING TO GET BACK  IN THE SADDLE. I DON'T  THINK YOU SHOULD. YOU NEED TO GET YOUR HEAD RIGHT FOR THIS SITUATION. YOU HAD AN EVENT TODAY. I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO BE BACK IN THE WATER NO MORE TODAY. COME ON OUT. YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN? WHEN I HEARD, "DIVER UP!  DIVER UP!" I JUST TURNED AND STARTED TO COME UP THE WALL, AND IT WAS LIKE [BLEEP] THAT MASK WENT  TO MY FACE SO HARD, AND IT'S THE FIRST TIME  THAT I SERIOUSLY [BLEEP] STARTED  TO PANIC. IT IS TERRIFYING. THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET  BACK IN THAT DAMN WATER. [BLEEP] Narrator:  UP NEXT... -NUGGET!  -THAT'S GOLD, BUDDY. WE'RE  GETTING CLOSER. ♪ THE BEST MEDICINE IS TO GET  BACK IN THAT DAMN WATER. [BLEEP] ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING. I'M GOING. Narrator:  ON HIS LAST DIVE, RICH PANICKED  WHEN HIS AIR SUPPLY FAILED. NOW HE'S BUCKING HIS FEARS, GETTING BACK IN THE RAGING CREEK AND DOWN TO THE NUGGET TRAP. Rich: I'D BE LYING IF I SAID  I WASN'T A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT I'M GOING TO GO BACK DOWN. I'M GOING TO GET BACK IN SADDLE. I JUST GOT TO GET THROUGH TODAY. RICHARD, YOU'RE CLEAR  TO GO DOWN. Narrator: DUSTIN HEADS BACK INTO THE CREEK  WITH RICH. Narrator:  OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS, GRAVITY COMPRESSES GRAVEL  ON THE CREEK BED INTO A DENSE LAYER  KNOWN AS HARDPACK. THIS IS NOW ALL THAT STANDS  BETWEEN THEM AND THE GOLD. Narrator:  THE HARDPACK IS TOO TOUGH  FOR THE SUCTION HOSE. WE'RE COMING UP. WE GOT THE AIR CHISEL. WE HAVE IT.  IT'S READY. WE SHOULD STICK IT DOWN THERE  TODAY, ACTUALLY, BUT TOMORROW WE'RE GOING  TO HIT THIS REALLY HARD. Dustin:  GOOD JOB TODAY, FELLOWS. ALL RIGHT.  LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. TOMORROW, WE'LL BE DIGGING  THROUGH HARDPACK. Fred: I DON'T THINK THAT THAT HARDPACK  IS MORE THAN 2 OR 3 FEET DEEP  AT THE MOST. WE'RE THAT CLOSE TO THE GOLD. ♪ ♪ Dustin: THEY MINED IN THIS AREA  ABOUT 100 YEARS AGO, AND IT TAKES OVER 100 YEARS  TO MAKE THIS ROCK LIKE IT IS, SO WE KNOW THAT NO ONE  HAS MINED HERE BEFORE. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS ROCK  THIS WAY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF YEARS,  AND THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK. A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL THIS  FALSE BEDROCK. RIGHT BELOW THIS IS WHERE  THE GOLD IS SITTING. WE JUST GOT TO GET THROUGH IT. THAT HARDPACK HAS GOT  THAT PREHISTORIC CEMENT. CAVEMAN CONCRETE, BROTHER. Narrator:  TO BREAK THROUGH THE HARDPACK,  THE CREW WILL USE A PNEUMATIC HAMMER  POWERED BY AN AIR COMPRESSOR. EACH STRIKE DELIVERS  150 POUNDS OF PRESSURE TO THE HARDENED STEEL CHISEL  3,000 TIMES A MINUTE. ♪ SO WHEN HE GETS DOWN THERE,  UNDERNEATH THE WATER, HE'S GOING TO ESSENTIALLY  GET ALL THIS HARDPACK, AND HE'S JUST GOING  TO TRY TO BREAK IT UP, PULVERIZE IT WHERE HE CAN  SUCK IT INTO THE DREDGE. THERE'S A LOT OF GOLF  MIXED INTO THAT HARDPACK, AND THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF GOLD  UNDERNEATH THE HARDPACK, WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE AFTER. Narrator:  DIVING WITH CARLOS TODAY  IS 74-YEAR-OLD FRED. HE'S GOING TO USE  THE AIR CHIPPER. AS HE CHIPS, I'LL BE SUCKING UP  THE DEBRIS ON THE BOTTOM, AND WE'RE GOING TO  GET AFTER THAT THING. -READY?  -LET'S DIVE! WE'RE IN BUSINESS, KIDS. RIGHT THERE.  YEP. OKAY. HERE IT COMES,  BROTHER. LET'S DO THIS. BRIGHT ORANGE HOSE.  [INDISTINCT] Paul: PERFECT.  ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE HOW HE DOES. WOW. WE'RE GETTING  DESPERATE FOR FUEL. Dustin:  I THINK WE NEED TO CHECK  ALL THESE FUEL BARRELS. Dustin: OH, MY [BLEEP].  WE RAN OUT OF FUEL. I HAVE NO IDEA  WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO. AH!  [BLEEP] OH, DUSTIN, MAN.  IT WAS A ROOKIE MISTAKE. Dustin: WE'RE IN TROUBLE. WE DON'T HAVE A SINGLE BARREL  LEFT OF FUEL, AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I MISSED  THIS, BUT I MISSED IT. I THINK I'M GOING THROUGH  ABOUT A BARREL AND A HALF PER WEEK RIGHT NOW,  MAYBE TWO BARRELS. Narrator: BETWEEN THE ENGINES  ON EACH DREDGE, GENERATORS, AND THE COMPRESSOR  FOR THE AIR HAMMER, FUEL COSTS DUSTIN $1,500 A WEEK. Dustin: WITHOUT ANY FUEL,  THESE THINGS DON'T RUN. -IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.  -WE NEED FUEL, OTHERWISE EVERYBODY  TAKE A BIG LONG VACATION. NO FUEL, NO GOLD. ♪ ♪ Narrator: IN THE BACK COUNTRY, 35 MILES NORTH OF  HAINES, ALASKA, THE DAKOTA  BOYS ARE SHUT DOWN. NO FUEL MEANS NO GOLD MINING. GETTING FUEL TO WHERE I NEED  IT IS REALLY HARD. THE HELICOPTERS KIND OF JACKED  UP THEIR PRICE A LITTLE BIT ON US, WHICH I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY  TO START THROWING AT FUEL LIKE I USED TO. Narrator:  TO AVOID A $2,000 HELI LIFT,  DUSTIN RISKS A BUSH RESUPPLY. HOW ABOUT WE HOOK IT UP AND THEN RUN A ZIPPER ACROSS IT? WE CAN DO THAT. WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO  IS GET THIS 55-GALLON DRUM 400 FEET ACROSS THIS RAVINE  THAT'S ABOUT 300-FEET DEEP, AND WE DON'T WANT TO DROP IT. WATCH YOUR FINGERS. THAT'S GOING TO HAVE  TO BE ENOUGH. ALL RIGHT. IF THAT ROPE GETS  STUCK, IT WILL UNTIE ITSELF, SO I DIDN'T THINK THAT THROUGH. ♪ COME ON, BABY. IS THAT WHERE YOU WANT IT  RIGHT THERE? ♪ Narrator:  DUSTIN HELIED IN THE ATV  AT THE START OF THE SEASON... BUT WHEN THE DIRT  ROAD DEAD-ENDS, THERE'S NO WAY TO LOWER  THE 380-POUND BARRELS SAFELY DOWN THE CANYON  TO THE MINE SITE. Dustin:  NOW, WE WANT TO BUILD  THIS LONG, LONG PIPE DOWN TO ANOTHER BARREL. SUPER SIMPLE, RIGHT? Narrator: THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN THE BARREL OVER THE ZIP WIRE FROM THE CAMP, ALONG THE ATV TRAIL  TO THE TOP OF THE CANYON. NOW, THEY'LL CONNECT  45 10-FOOT STEEL PIPES TO GET THE FUEL DOWN THE  450-FOOT DROP TO McKINLEY CREEK AND DIRECTLY INTO AN  EMPTY BARREL AT THE BOTTOM. ♪ YEAH, I'VE GOT TO PUT SEALANT ON  THIS -- THESE, BEFORE I PUT THEM TOGETHER. I CAN'T HAVE GAS LEAKING OUT  OF ANY OF IT BECAUSE IT'S GONNA HAVE  A LOT OF PRESSURE BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE BOTTOM,  SO ALL THESE JOINTS HAVE GOT TO HAVE SOME KIND OF COMPOUND  ON THEM SO THEY WON'T LEAK. NOW THE TRICK IS GOING TO BE, "CAN WE PUT THEM TOGETHER  GOING DOWN THE HILL?" YEAH.  WE DEFINITELY CAN. READY? ♪ OKAY.  RIGHT THERE, IT'S GOOD. Paul: WE DECIDED TO GO  WITH THE METAL PIPE BECAUSE OF THE BEARS  AND ALL THE PORCUPINES. THEY LOVE TO CHEW UP ANYTHING  THAT'S PLASTIC, SO THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP THEM  FROM POKING HOLES IN OUR PIPE, WE HAD TO GO WITH METAL. ALL RIGHT.  READY TO GO AGAIN. STANDBY. COPY. ♪ ♪ -HERE IT COMES, PAUL.  -COPY THAT. Carlos:  SO FAR, SO GOOD. WE'RE ABOUT A FOOT  FROM THE EDGE. Dustin: PAUL!  CAN YOU SEND ME DOWN A PIECE? ♪ IT'S GOING.  WE GOT THIS. WE'RE ON A ROLL. TALK ABOUT RELAXING TODAY. IT WAS A PRETTY CHILL DAY,  THOUGH, RIGHT? COME ON.  -NOT BAD. NOT BAD AT ALL.  -PRETTY CHILL. HANGING FROM THE SIDE  OF A MOUNTAIN. Paul: THE CRAZY [BLEEP]  THAT WE DO TO MINE IN ALASKA. ♪ ♪ ♪ Paul:  WE GOT OUR PIPE IN. WELL, THIS IS THE LAST  CONNECTION THAT I'VE GOT TO DO, AND WE'RE GOING TO DO OUR FIRST  FUEL DROP DOWN THE MOUNTAIN. SO LIKE THIS, NOW WE HAVE  A BARREL AT THE TOP. WE'LL HAVE A BARREL DOWN  AT THE BOTTOM. ALL WE'VE GOT TO DO  IS OPEN OUR VALVE, AND IT SHOULD FILL OUR BARREL  DOWN UP HERE WITH FUEL. ONCE WE HAVE THIS BARREL  WITH FUEL, THEN WE CAN CARRY IT BACK AND FORTH  TO THE DREDGE SITE REAL EASY. THIS IS GOING TO BE  A LIFESAVER RIGHT HERE. -DUSTIN, YOU HAVE A COPY?  -YEAH, I GOT YOU, MAN. WHAT'S UP? OKAY.  I'M READY ON MY END. ARE YOU READY TO RECEIVE  A LITTLE BIT OF FUEL? YEAH.  GIVE ME A LITTLE TRICKLE. JUST LET ME KNOW  WHEN YOU SEE A LITTLE BIT OF FUEL  OUT OF THE BOTTOM. I AM NOT GOING TO LET  VERY MUCH THROUGH TO START. COPY THAT. I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN SOMETHING  HAPPENS, BUT NOTHING YET. YOU SHOULD HAVE A GOOD  FLOW COMING DOWN. STILL NOTHING, MAN.  STILL NOTHING. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, MAN? I GOT MY VALVE ALL THE WAY OPEN,  AND THERE'S NOTHING HAPPENING. I HAVE ALL OF MY VALVES  OPEN, TOO. THAT [BLEEP]  DON'T MAKE SENSE. LET'S TRY SOMETHING ELSE  THEN, HUH? WE DO HAVE THAT GAS-POWERED  COMPRESSOR DOWN THERE THAT WILL PUT  OUT 120 POUNDS IF WE CAN  HOOK A LINE TO IT AND JUST BLOW THIS  [BLEEP] RIGHT OUT. Narrator:  THE COMPRESSOR WILL FIRE A JET  OF AIR DOWN THE 450-FOOT LINE. WHATEVER IS IN THE LINE,  WE'RE GOING TO PUSH IT OUT. ALL RIGHT. I'M GOING  TO FIRE THIS THING UP, AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET  A FLOW THROUGH HERE. ♪ ♪ OKAY, I'M GOING TO  SEND YOU SOME AIR. I HAVE ABOUT 90 POUNDS OF  PRESSURE ON THE COMPRESSOR. LET'S SEE  WHAT THAT WILL DO. ♪ ♪ Dustin:  WELL, I'LL FIND OUT SHORTLY. OKAY. KEEP  YOUR FINGERS CROSSED THAT THIS IS GOING  TO COME DOWN THIS TIME. I'VE GOT EVERYTHING HOOKED UP, AND I'M GOING TO TRY  TO SEND YOU FUEL AGAIN. COPY THAT.  HERE WE GO. Dustin: YEAH, GOT FUEL.  I GOT FUEL. THAT IS AMAZING. THIS WILL SAVE US  A LOT OF MONEY. IT'S A GREAT AFTERNOON. WE GOT IT CLEARED,  GOT FUEL GOING DOWN. NOW WE CAN JUST CONCENTRATE  ON GETTING PAST THE HARDPACK. IT'S ALL ABOUT FINDING  THE GOLD NOW. I LIKE IT WHEN A PLAN  COMES TOGETHER. Narrator:  DUSTIN'S NEW SYSTEM WILL SAVE  $500 ON EVERY BARREL OF FUEL. NOW WE CAN GET FUEL,  GET IT UP THERE. THIS IS SO MUCH CHEAPER,  AND WE'RE DONE WITH IT. WE GOT IT. ♪ Narrator:  AND IT'S GOT THE DAKOTA BOYS  BACK SMASHING THROUGH HARDPACK  TO THE BEDROCK GOLD. WE'RE GETTING DEEP FINALLY,  FINALLY. THE CREW IS JUST 2 1/2 FEET  FROM BEDROCK. WE'RE FINALLY GETTING OUR DEPTH  THAT WE NEED. ONCE WE GET THROUGH  THAT HARDPACK, IT SHOULD BE  GOLD CITY FROM THERE. TOMORROW SHOULD BE THE DAY. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET  THROUGH THAT HARDPACK. HELL, YEAH. ♪ ♪ ♪ IT RAINED LIKE HELL LAST NIGHT.  I DIDN'T SLEEP A WINK, SO I'VE BEEN  THINKING ABOUT IT ALL NIGHT. SO THE GUYS MADE IT DOWN THERE, AND I WANTED TO KNOW  WHAT HAPPENED. ♪ THAT RAIN  IS SOMETHING ELSE. Narrator:  OVERNIGHT RAINFALL HIGH  IN THE CHILKAT MOUNTAINS HAS RAISED THE WATER LEVEL  IN McKINLEY CREEK BY 3 FEET. Fred: GETTING PRETTY SERIOUS  DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW, BUT MOTHER NATURE NEVER COUNTED  ON GUYS LIKE DUSTIN AND I. IT COULD PICK UP  EVEN MORE TODAY. THAT'S WHAT I THINK  IT'S GOING TO DO BECAUSE THAT BIG ROCK  IS OUR MARKER. THAT MARKER RIGHT THERE ALWAYS TELLS ME WHERE WE'RE AT. Dustin: ANOTHER FOOT HIGH, THE BOULDERS ARE GOING TO START  ROLLING INTO MY HOLE. AS SOON AS YOU START HEARING  BIG BOULDERS, I'M OUT. THAT'S IT.  WE'RE DONE. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.  I MEAN, YOU GET CRUSHED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING.  -RIGHT. Narrator:  CONDITIONS HAVE GONE  FROM DANGEROUS TO POTENTIALLY LETHAL DOWN  IN THE DIVE HOLE DUSTIN AND CASEY  ARE ABOUT TO ENTER. CASEY, HOW ABOUT YOU  DON'T GO DOWN? I'LL GO DOWN. I HAVE SO MUCH EXPERIENCE  IN THIS STUFF RIGHT HERE. I JUST DON'T WANT YOU  TO GET HURT.
