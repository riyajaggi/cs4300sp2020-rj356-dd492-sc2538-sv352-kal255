 Narrator: THE DAKOTA BOYS ARE  ALMOST THREE MONTHS INTO THEIR ALASKAN  HUNT FOR GOLD. OH, [BLEEP]. OH, MY [BLEEP]. THIS IS NOT GOOD. Narrator:  THEY'VE INVESTED $75,000 BUT ARE NOWHERE NEAR A PAYDAY. WE HAD A 12-FOOT-DEEP HOLE. NOW IT'S LESS THAN TWO FEET  DEEP RIGHT THERE. TWO MONTHS WORTH OF WORK  [BLEEP] GONE DOWN THE DRAIN! WHAT THE [BLEEP]? WE DON'T HAVE A HOLE ANYWHERE,  NOWHERE. YOU SERIOUS, MAN?  YOU'RE NOT PLAYING AROUND? Narrator: NOW A FLASH FLOOD  AND LANDSLIDE HAVE WIPED OUT ALL THEIR BACKBREAKING WORK.

ALL THAT HARD WORK  OVERNIGHT IS GONE, BUT WE'RE RIGHT BACK  TO GROUND ZERO AGAIN, RIGHT BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED. I'VE WORKED MONTHS AND MONTHS  AND MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS AT THIS AND ONLY TO HAVE IT  ALL WIPED OUT IN SECONDS. THERE COULD BE MILLIONS OF OUNCES RIGHT BELOW US RIGHT NOW, BUT IS IT GONNA TAKE  A MILLION DIVES TO GET IT? Carlos:  WHEN DO YOU SAY, "ENOUGH"? WHEN DO YOU GO BACK  TO YOUR FAMILY AND SAY, "HEY, I GOT BEATEN UP. I NEED ANOTHER JOB"? MY CREW RIGHT NOW IS BROKEN. I CAN SEE IT ALL IN THEIR EYES. THEY ALL WANT TO QUIT.
