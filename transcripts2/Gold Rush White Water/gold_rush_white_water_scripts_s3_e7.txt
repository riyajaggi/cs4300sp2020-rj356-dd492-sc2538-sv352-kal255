 ♪ ♪ Fred: How's it looking down there, Paul? Paul: I think this little waterfall is done. If there was anything in it, we got it. Narrator: DEEP IN THE ALASKAN WILDERNESS, VETERAN MINER FRED HURT AND HIS CREW WORK THE RAGING WHITE WATERS OF CAHOON CREEK ON THE HUNT FOR GOLD. I THINK WE FINALLY CLEARED OUT EVERY LITTLE BIT OF THIS LITTLE WATERFALL.

 IT'S TIME TO MOVE UP, HIT THAT BIG ONE. Fred: GOOD JOB, PAUL. I HAD TO COME UP BECAUSE THERE'S... THERE WAS NOTHING MORE FOR ME TO DREDGE ON THAT BANK UP THERE. DEFINITELY TIME TO CHECK THE SLUICE. Narrator: AFTER A 4-HOUR DIVE, PAUL RICHARDSON HAS MINED THE LAST OF THE GRAVEL FROM FRED'S SECOND DIVE SPOT, THE MINI WATERFALL. WELL, I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S MORE MATERIAL IN THIS BACK BOX. Paul: OH, WOW. IT DEFINITELY CAUGHT LOTS OF MATERIAL. YEAH. OH, LOOK RIGHT THERE. WHAT? HOLY [BLEEP]

 WE'VE GOT GOLD. WHERE? THERE, THERE, THERE. AT LEAST THREE PICKERS I CAN SEE. WOW. AND THERE'S ONE RIGHT UP THERE. THERE. VERY NICE. THAT WATERFALL PROVIDED JUST A LITTLE BIT, DIDN'T IT? YEAH, IT DID. GOOD DIVE, MAN. GOOD DIVE. [ LAUGHS ] Fred: THIS IS THE MOST WE'VE SEEN IN THE SLUICE AT ONE TIME. THOSE ARE NICE. YEAH, IT MAKES THE FUTURE LOOK PRETTY EXCITING. THAT IS PRETTY. YEAH. THAT IS. THAT IS REALLY PRETTY. I'M EXCITED TO KEEP MOVING UPSTREAM BECAUSE IF WE'VE GOT THIS HERE IN THE LITTLE WATERFALL, THERE'S BOUND TO BE SOME MORE GOLD, AND IT MIGHT EVEN BE EVEN BIGGER. IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO BAD AT ALL. YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT BRINGS SMILES, SO I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT. WHEN YOU SEE THAT GOLD, YOU GET EXCITED. YEAH, IT'S ABOUT THE GOLD. WHAT KEEPS YOU OUT HERE IS THE HUNT FOR GOLD, THE HUNT. Narrator: ON THIS "GOLD RUSH: WHITE WATER"... Fred: DUSTIN HAS GOT HIS TWO DREDGES. NOW WE GOT OUR TWO DREDGES. [ LAUGHS ] LOVE YOU GUYS, MAN. Carlos: CAN YOU HEAR JAMES ON THE RADIO? Dustin: Get him out of there! AH! AH, AH, AH! WE'RE ALL LUCKY THAT WE'RE STANDING HERE RIGHT NOW. Dustin: Seeing gold go into your nozzle, that's something I've dreamed of for 5 years. Wes: THAT WAS SITTING ON TOP OF THE ROCK THAT I JUST PULLED OUT. THERE'S, LIKE, NUGGETS EVERYWHERE. OUR FORTUNE IS WAITING RIGHT THERE. IT'S EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A GOLD CATCH, SO WHERE'S THE DAMN GOLD? CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS ♪ Dustin: THIS IS GONNA BE CRAZY. WE'RE ONLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON RIGHT NOW, AND THIS HOLE IS A LOT BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE. Narrator: IT'S A BIG DAY AT DUSTIN'S RAINBOW'S END SITE. AFTER 3 MONTHS OF HARD WORK, THE CREW HAS HIT HARDPACK, THE LAST LAYER OF COMPRESSED DIRT BETWEEN THE MINERS AND THE GOLD ON THE BEDROCK. Dustin: WE'RE GONNA USE A PRESSURE WASHER. WE'RE GONNA DIG STRAIGHT DOWN, BLAST THROUGH THE HARDPACK, STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE BEDROCK. I'LL BE DIVING JUST BENEATH JAMES, 16 FEET DOWN. IF ANYTHING COMES DOWN, IT'S LANDING RIGHT ON ME. THIS IS SUPER DANGEROUS, BUT WE NEED TO GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING. Narrator: OVER THE LAST 120 YEARS, THE CREEKS AROUND THE CHILKAT MOUNTAINS HAVE PRODUCED MORE THAN $100 MILLION WORTH OF GOLD. THE CREWS SUSPECT THEY COULD NOW BE JUST FEET AWAY FROM A LIFE-CHANGING BONANZA. All right. You're good to go. How's my lines look? Everything... You're looking good, man. You're looking great. Oh, you all right? I'm great. Narrator: DUSTIN IS THE FIRST TO DIVE, DETERMINED TO BREAK THROUGH THE HARDPACK. You're clear. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Dustin: I can't believe how long this [bleep] hole is taking. Let's get going. ♪ All right, James. Just jump in, man. I got you. Let's do this thing. Find us some gold, amigo. Narrator: WHILE JAMES DREDGES THE STEEP SIDES OF THE PLUNGE POOL, DUSTIN WILL GO DEEP AND BLAST HIS WAY THROUGH THE HARDPACK TO GET TO BEDROCK GOLD. -James, can you hear me? -Yeah, I'm right here. Dustin: All right. So here's what's gonna happen. I'm going to use this sprayer over here. Okay. Just stay on your side and fill the basket, man. Okay, yeah. Okay, let me know when you need that basket up. ♪ ♪ This basket is ready. -All right. -Going up. ♪ NICE BASKET, GENTLEMAN, A NICE BASKET. Hey, dusty. How's it going with the pressure washer down there? I'm digging a 3-foot layer out of the hardpack. I THINK THAT BEDROCK IS ABOUT 18 FEET, JUST GUESSING, LOOKING AT THE SLOPE OF THIS, KIND OF FIGURING THE ANGLES. I'VE GOT A FEELING IT'S A LOT DEEPER THAN WE THINK IT IS, BUT ON THE BOTTOM IS GONNA BE A BIG PAYDAY. Dustin: Oh, man, more of these Green, slick rocks. It just keeps going up. Okay, clear. COPY THAT, COMING UP ON THE BASKET. Wes: THE GREEN ROCKS ARE HEAVIER THAN ALL THE REST OF THE ROCKS, AND WE'VE ALWAYS FOUND GOOD GOLD AROUND THESE GREEN ROCKS, SO WE'RE GETTING CLOSER TO THE BOTTOM. ♪ Dustin: Oh, no [bleep] way. I found bedrock in the bottom. Really? Yes! Whoo! That is the bottom right here. James: Holy [bleep] That is exciting. What we thought was a big-ass boulder sitting here, it is bedrock. Wow. Dug a hole straight down. There's huge cracks that go way down. There's everything you want in a gold-catching bedrock. It's the perfect hiding spot. Oh, this just made your day, didn't it, getting down to this? Yeah, dude. This is pretty incredible right here where we're at. James, I'm gonna change up a few things. All right? Okay. You see that hole on your right? Yeah. I want you to clean off as much of it as you can. Okay. Watch your feet because I'm right below you. All right? Okay. If any rock comes down, it's gonna land right on me. Narrator: AFTER MONTHS OF DIGGING, DUSTIN AND JAMES ARE FINALLY DREDGING THE BOTTOM OF THE PLUNGE POOL, THE SETTLING POINT, FOR HEAVY NUGGETS OF GOLD. Wes: I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY DARK MATERIAL COME OUT TODAY LIKE THIS, SO THAT'S A GOOD SIGN. Dustin: Oh, look at all these anomalies. You know, I've never been on a bottom when it felt like this. Oh, every time I get down somewhere and it's disappointing as hell. Right now, it doesn't feel that way. Right now, it feels like this [bleep] is made to catch gold. DUSTIN IS LIKING THE WAY THE BOTTOM LOOKS. HE'S FELT PART OF THE BEDROCK AND WHAT HE'S LIKING IS IT'S NOT SMOOTH, IT'S GOT ALL THESE ANOMALIES AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF THAT'LL CATCH THE GOLD. Dustin: This is [bleep] cool. It's just so much fun. HOW ARE YOU DOING, JAMES? JAMES, YOU STILL THERE? JAMES? JAMES? JAMES? HEY, ANYBODY HEAR JAMES ON THE RADIO? JAMES? NO, I CAN'T HEAR HIM. CAN YOU HEAR HIM? NO. James? James, you okay? [ SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY ] CAN YOU HEAR JAMES? Dustin: Get him out of there! Bring him out! ♪ I CAN'T HEAR YOU, LOST YOU. [BLEEP] EVERYBODY JUST LOOKS AT ME LIKE I'VE GOT TWO HEADS, MAN. James' plug, did you step on it? What's going on? Okay, I got you now. Now I can hear him. You stepped on it. You guys go ahead and take care of him And I'll come out after he's done. GOOD JOB, JAMES. I want to see what's in the sluice box. Yeah, copy that. Narrator: AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF DREDGING THE BEDROCK, DUSTIN CALLS TIME TO SEE IF THE PLUNGE POOL HAS FINALLY PAID OUT. What a fun day, man. Awesome. Ah, it was fun. AH, IT WAS A HELL OF A DAY. WHAT THE HELL, MAN? BEDROCK, MAN! THAT'S FREAKING AWESOME. [ LAUGHS ] OH, THAT WAS FUN. I FOUND THE BOTTOM OF THIS THING. IT'S JUST EXCITING. WE'VE BEEN WORKING OUR ASSES OFF TO GET TO THE BOTTOM, AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM. Dustin: SWEET. IT'S PRETTY CRAZY WHAT'S DOWN THERE. SO YOU'VE GOT A HOLE IN A HOLE NOW OR WHAT? Dustin: DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT WE HAD? YEAH. 9 FEET ACROSS, IT'S NOW... I JUST SHOT STRAIGHT DOWN. HOLY [BLEEP] THAT'S AWESOME. WELL. NAH. WE'RE STILL NOT TO THE DEEP AREA. YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S NO GOLD IN THE BEDROCK? THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING, MAN. IT'S EMPTY. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS [BLEEP] I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT. THAT BEDROCK IS PERFECT. I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S POSSIBLE. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A GOLD CATCH. Wes: YEAH. SO WHERE'S THE DAMN GOLD? THAT'S PRETTY WEIRD, DUDE. THIS IS BULL[BLEEP] Narrator: DUSTIN HAS GAMBLED HIS WHOLE SUMMER DIGGING THE SINGLE PLUNGE POOL. STRIKING OUT ON BEDROCK IS A DISASTER. I JUST CLEANED OFF THE BEST SECTION OF BEDROCK I'VE EVER CLEANED OFF AT THE BOTTOM OF A WATERFALL, AND I CAME UP WITH NO GOLD. THERE WAS GOLD ALL THE WAY DOWN, NOW THERE'S NOTHING. THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME. THERE'S NO WAY THERE'S NO [BLEEP] GOLD DOWN THERE. THERE HAS TO BE GOLD. ♪ ♪ HEY, Y'ALL, COME ON UP HERE FOR A MINUTE. Narrator: AT TWO FISH, UNLIKE DUSTIN'S PLAN TO MINE A SINGLE WATERFALL, FRED IS DETERMINED TO DREDGE EVERY GOLD CATCH IN A 150-FOOT STRETCH OF CREEK. THE MINI WATERFALL NOW CLEANED OUT, THE CREW MUST DECIDE THEIR NEXT MOVE. I THINK WE JUST JUMP RIGHT UP AHEAD AND JUST KEEP MOVING AHEAD. I DON'T KNOW, FRED. I THINK WE JUST NEED TO GO STRAIGHT FOR THAT BIG WATERFALL. WE ARE LIMITED ON TIME AND WE CAN GET RIGHT IN THERE. WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. I KNOW EVERYBODY IS EAGER TO JUMP UP IN THAT BIG WATERFALL. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THAT LITTLE AREA BETWEEN HERE AND THAT WATERFALL. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF GOLD-CATCHING AREAS IN THERE, NATURAL RIPPLES. I'D SAY JUST KEEP PROGRESSING JUST LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING. LET'S FIND OUT WHAT'S IN HERE AND ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE HAD SKIPPED OVER A BUNCH OF GOLD. ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET TO WORK. ALL RIGHT. Narrator: BEFORE HITTING THE BIG WATERFALL, THE CREW MUST WORK A 50-FOOT STRETCH OF SHALLOW CREVICES WHICH FRED BELIEVES COULD BE THE PERFECT HIDING PLACE FOR RICH DEPOSITS OF GOLD. BEFORE I GO JUST HOPPING ON TO THE BIG WATERFALL, WE MAY LEAVE SOMETHING IMPORTANT BEHIND. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU COME ACROSS. TIME, RIGHT NOW, IS WORKING AGAINST US. FRED HAS GOT IT WRONG. PERSONALLY, I THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR THE WATERFALL. Narrator: TOO SHALLOW TO FLOAT THE DREDGE IN THE ROCKY CREVICES, FRED'S PLAN, EXTEND THE 30-FOOT HOSE FROM ITS CURRENT POSITION. OH, THAT'S NOT GONNA REACH. IT'S NOT GONNA REACH. WE NEED ABOUT 8 MORE FEET AND THAT DOESN'T HAVE IT. WHAT THE HELL ARE WE GONNA DO HERE? I WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF INVESTIGATE THIS AREA A LITTLE BIT HERE. WELL, I'VE GOT THAT LITTLE 2-INCH DREDGE DOWN IN PORCUPINE. YEAH, THAT THING WILL FLOAT THERE. IF NOT, WE'LL GO UNDERWATER. WE WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THAT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR THAT. Narrator: SO FAR, FRED'S CREW HAS MINED 100 FEET OF CREEK LEADING UP TO THE MINI WATERFALL. ALL THAT REMAINS BETWEEN THEM AND THE BIG WATERFALL, A NARROW 50-FOOT STRETCH OF ROCKY CREVICES. PAUL'S NEW 2-INCH DREDGE COULD BE THE PERFECT TOOL TO CLEAN THESE NATURAL GOLD CATCHES. Paul: WE FOUND SOME NICE, CHUNKY GOLD. SO SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE, IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY GOOD. HOPEFULLY THIS IS THE KEY TO FINDING THAT RIGHT SPOT. Narrator: A FEW HOURS LATER, PAUL RETURNS WITH THE MINI DREDGE. PAUL, WHENEVER YOU GET READY, GIVE ME A HOLLER ON THE RADIO. COPY THAT. WITH THIS TERRAIN HERE THAT YOU CAN'T MOVE THE BIG ONE WHERE YOU WANT TO GO, THAT LITTLE DREDGE MIGHT HAVE SOME BENEFITS. SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE IT A TRY. ALL RIGHT. I'M SENDING THE LITTLE DREDGE DOWN. COPY THAT. WE'RE READY. IT'S COMING. THERE SHE COMES. YEE-HOO, GOT IT. GOT IT, GOT IT, GOT IT! SUCCESS. HEY, HEY. [ LAUGHS ] THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIZE LITTLE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT TO BRING DOWN HERE. THIS JUST MIGHT HELP US OUT IN FINDING NEW AREAS HERE. MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOME OLD-FASHIONED PROSPECTING. COOL LITTLE DREDGE, MAN, DOESN'T WEIGH MUCH AT ALL EITHER. COOL LITTLE THING, HUH? YEAH. Narrator: THE MINI DREDGE TAKES JUST MINUTES TO SET UP. LET'S FIND SOME GOLD. THE DREDGE, THE LITTLE TWO-INCH DREDGE, CAN DREDGE IN WATER ABOUT THAT DEEP. Narrator: PAUL SUBMERGES THE INTAKE HOSE, WHICH CREATES A VACUUM IN THE SUCTION HOSE. -WHOO! -TOWARDS THE EDGES. Paul: ALL RIGHT. LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. KAYLA USES THE SUCTION HOSE TO PULL GRAVEL FROM THE ROCKY CREVICES. Kayla: I KNEW I HAD SOME EXPERIENCE COMING IN, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW VACUUMING WOULD BE ONE OF THEM. Narrator: WHILE RYAN TENDS THE DREDGE AND WATCHES OVER THE SLUICE BOX. HOWS IT GOING BACK THERE? GOING GREAT, SLUICE BOX LOOKS LIKE IT'S RUNNING WELL. HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE A LITTLE COLOR IN THE BOX. Fred: IF THERE'S ANY GOLD IN HERE AND THEY CAN FIND SOME LITTLE SPOTS LIKE THIS TO SUCK UP, THAT'LL WORK. Paul: THERE MIGHT BE A WHOLE LOT OF GOLD IN SOME OF THESE PLACES. IT'S DEFINITELY DIFFERENT GOING FROM A 6-INCH DOWN TO A 2-INCH. NO SUCTION. NO SUCTION? Fred: IT QUIT PUMPING, BY THE WAY. HOLD UP. SOMEHOW WE GOT A LITTLE PLUG UP. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GETTING THE WATER PRESSURE WE SHOULD BE GETTING. YOU KNOW, WE MIGHT HAVE SUCKED UP SOME ROCKS IN THE IMPELLER A MINUTE AGO. IT'S PROBABLY CLOGGED UP UP HERE. THAT'S THE ONLY THING I CAN THINK. Narrator: PAUL'S 2-INCH PROSPECTING DREDGE IS A SCALED-DOWN VERSION OF THEIR 6-INCH DREDGE AND WORKS BY THE SAME METHOD. THE PUMP IMPELLER SUCKS WATER INTO THE INTAKE HOSE AND SENDS IT INTO THE SUCTION HOSE, CREATING A VACUUM, WHICH PULLS WATER AND GOLD-RICH GRAVEL UP INTO THE SLUICE BOX. YEAH, THERE'S ALL KINDS OF ROCKS IN THAT IMPELLER. OKAY, THAT WILL DO IT. WE HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE DREDGE IS. WE SUCKED UP A ROCK INTO THE INTAKE, AND IT WASN'T DELIVERING ENOUGH WATER TO DO ANY GOOD, AND WE WENT AHEAD AND PULLED THE ROCKS ALL OUT, AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE A LITTLE PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE TO KEEP THE ROCKS OUT OF THE INTAKE. HOPEFULLY BY PUTTING THIS BUCKET HERE, SETTING A BIG ROCK ON TOP OF IT, IT SHOULDN'T ALLOW THE SUCTION HOSE TO GET DOWN IN THE SMALL GRAVEL AND SUCK IT UP LIKE IT DID LAST TIME. AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT WATER FLOWING INTO IT, WE SHOULD BE FINE. Narrator: PAUL'S ON-THE-FLY REPAIRS HAS THE TEAM UP AND RUNNING AGAIN, DREDGING FOR GOLD. THE SLUICE BOX HAS GOT ABOUT THREE TIMES MORE WATER COMING OUT IN IT. SO I SEE SOME GRAVEL ROLLING THROUGH NOW. Fred: ALL RIGHT. KEEP DREDGING. THIS IS LIKE USING A TOY. IT'S ABOUT THE SMALLEST THING I'VE EVER USED FOR SUCKING UP ANYTHING. IT'S WORKING GREAT, THOUGH. WE GOT A LITTLE BUCKET, PUT THE SUCTION DOWN IN IT, WEIGHTED IT DOWN. WORKING PERFECT. ALL SYSTEMS GO. SO WE JUST GO AHEAD AND JUST KEEP PROSPECTING, GET OUR AREAS THAT WE WANT TO INVESTIGATE. THE HUNT IS STILL ON. DUSTIN HAS GOT HIS TWO DREDGES. NOW WE GOT OUR TWO DREDGES. [ LAUGHS ] ♪ WE HIT BEDROCK YESTERDAY. RATHER, I HIT BEDROCK YESTERDAY. James: IT TOOK ALL OF US. YOU WERE RIGHT THE FIRST TIME. YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. WE HIT BEDROCK YESTERDAY. IT'S PROBABLY THE BEST DAY OF DREDGING I'VE EVER HAD. I THOUGHT FOR SURE, THERE WOULD BE A TON OF GOLD, AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY. IF YOU WERE MAKING SOMETHING TO CATCH GOLD, IT WOULD LOOK JUST LIKE WHAT I UNCOVERED, AND THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT. IT'S FREAKING US ALL OUT A LITTLE BIT. NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO WORK TODAY. WE STILL HAVE HALF OF THE WATERFALL TO CLEAN OUT ON THE BOTTOM, BUT I DON'T KNOW. THAT'S A LOT OF DAMN WORK FOR NOTHING. THERE BETTER BE SOME GOLD ON ONE SIDE. Narrator: AFTER 3 MONTHS OF DIGGING AT RAINBOW'S END, DUSTIN'S FAILURE TO FIND GOLD ON THE BEDROCK HAS THROWN HIS WHOLE OPERATION INTO DOUBT. GOLD HAS GOT TO BE THERE, MAN. IT'S A HUGE FREAKING HOLE. WE WAS FINDING IT IN THE BEGINNING. IT'S A HUGE HOLE. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF HIDING SPACES FOR THAT GOLD. THE BOTTOM OF THAT COULD BE 20-FOOT AROUND... SURE. ABSOLUTELY. ...IN DIAMETER. AND ALL OF YOUR GOLD CAN BE IN THE SIZE OF A JAR SITTING IN ONE LITTLE POCKET. UNTIL WE FIND THE VERY DEEPEST AREA OF THAT HOLE, WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND THE BIG POCKET OF GOLD. SO WITH THAT IN MIND, WE'RE GONNA GO GET THE GOLD, MAN. ♪ I'M GOING DOWN TODAY. Narrator: YESTERDAY, DUSTIN AND JAMES FINALLY HIT BEDROCK, BUT AFTER SEVERAL HOURS DREDGING, CAME UP EMPTY HANDED. BEFORE THEY CAN CONTINUE THE HUNT FOR GOLD, SEASONED DIVER CARLOS MINOR HAS WORK TO DO. Carlos: I'VE GOT TO MAKE THINGS SAFE. IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE FREAKING DIGGING A HOLE WITHIN A HOLE. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT THAT MEANS. A HOLE WITHIN A HOLE, THAT'S POTENTIAL TO FILL IN IF A DIVER IS IN THERE SO I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT HOLE IS NON-DANGEROUS. Narrator: ON HIS LAST DIVE, DUSTIN BLASTED STRAIGHT DOWN THROUGH HARDPACK TO EXPOSE THE BEDROCK. THIS CREATED A HOLE WITHIN A HOLE WITH DANGEROUS OVERHANGING BOULDERS. CARLOS MUST REMOVE THESE WIDOW-MAKERS BEFORE HE AND JAMES CAN SAFELY GET BACK TO DREDGING FOR THE POCKET OF GOLD ON THE BEDROCK. EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THE HOLE DOWN THERE BECAUSE IT'S EXCITING AND FUN, AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR GOLD. IT'S CARLOS AND JAMES' TIME TO GO DOWN. I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THEY DIDN'T FINISH THIS DAMN HOLE TODAY. THERE SHOULD BE POUNDS AND POUNDS AND POUNDS OF GOLD. IF THERE'S NOT, A BIG CHECK MARK ON THE [BLEEP] FAILURE BOX. ♪ Hole within a hole, man. Ugh, I've never even heard of such a thing. Yeah, well, you knew what I was gonna do. Carlos: Yeah, I know. It just sounds scary, dude, a hole within a hole. What the hell does that mean? Well, it means I got impatient. That's exactly what that means. We've been here too long, man. I'm just saying. Be safe down there, man. How's your mask feel? Good, it feels good. Let's see what you've got. All right. Okay. All right. Thank you. ♪ WE HAD THIS BIG, GIGANTIC DEEP HOLE, AND I JUST TUNNELED ONE STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM BECAUSE I GOT IMPATIENT. CARLOS AND I BUILT THIS RELATIONSHIP. I GO DOWN AND I MAKE IT DANGEROUS, AND HE COMES BEHIND ME AND MAKES IT SAFE. IT'S A GOOD BALANCE. IF YOU'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT HOLE AND ANYTHING FALLS FROM ANY SIDE, IT'S GONNA LAND ON YOU, NO MATTER WHAT, AND THERE'S SOME BIG DAMN ROCKS WAITING ON THE TOP EDGE TO COME AND CRUSH YOU. SO CARLOS IS GONNA GO AND GET MOST OF THOSE BIG ROCKS AND PULL THEM BEFORE THEY START DIVING TODAY. YESTERDAY, WHAT JAMES AND I WERE DOING WAS DANGEROUS. WE KNEW IT. I KNEW IT. I JUST... CHASING THE GOLD, MOBY-DICK. -How is it down there, man? -All right, man. Carlos: Everything is pretty much good to go. Dustin: We're about to send James down there. CAN'T WAIT TO GET IN THERE WITH CARLOS TODAY AND WORK ALONGSIDE WITH HIM DOWN THERE ON THE BEDROCK AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DISCOVER. READY FOR THIS? READY. Ready to rock and roll in here, man? Yes, sir. Have a good, safe dive. Yeah? We got a super claw inbound. Narrator: CARLOS NEEDS WES' SUPER CLAW TO REMOVE A MASSIVE BOULDER FROM THE BEDROCK. Is that you want, against the wall? Copy that. Wes: WE'VE GOT OUR SUPER CLAW GOING TODAY. ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP US GET THESE ROCKS OUT FASTER IS GREAT. CAME UP WITH THIS SUPER CLAW, AND SO FAR, IT'S BEEN WORKING EXACTLY THE WAY WE WANT IT TO. ♪ James: Clear, clear. ♪ -Claw is up. -All right. I can't believe I can see. Carlos: What's up, dude? I said I can't believe how well I can see. This is good, man. Right now I'm seeing gold. I'm seeing gold. That's what I like to hear, man! Narrator: REMOVING THE BOULDER HAS REVEALED THE GOLD POCKET THEY'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR. Dustin: So you're seeing gold? Where are you digging exactly? Carlos: It's on the bedrock, right on the bedrock. That sounds amazing, man. So we're finding gold? Oh, find some more, man. IF HE'S SEEING PICKERS, THAT'S A REALLY, REALLY GOOD SIGN. Oh, my God. You're getting it, man. IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING. AH, IT'S KILLING ME THAT JAMES IS DOWN THERE, AND I'M NOT RIGHT NOW. AH! Carlos: Guys, this is amazing. Dustin: I can't believe it. AH! WHOO! FINDING GOLD, THAT IS EXCITING. WHOO-HOO! NOW I NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH. GET IT! ♪ Paul: YEAH, WE'VE GOT THIS LITTLE BIT OF A ROCK THAT'S STICKING UP A LITTLE. THERE'S A POCKET BEHIND IT, SO THERE'S A PLACE THAT GOLD COULD GET TRAPPED. Narrator: AT TWO FISH, FRED'S CREW IS DREDGING A SMALL GOLD CATCH ON THE SIDE OF THE CREEK. Paul: YEAH, THE SMALL DREDGE WORKS JUST LIKE THE BIG DREDGE. IT'S JUST YOU CAN'T MOVE AS MUCH MATERIAL AS QUICKLY. BUT IF THERE'S GOLD HERE, IT'LL CATCH IT. Fred: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER USED ANY DREDGE LIKE THAT. YEAH, THERE'S A NICE LITTLE POCKET RIGHT THERE, SO... GOD, I'D HATE TO PASS THIS AREA UP WITHOUT REALLY CHECKING IT OUT REALLY GOOD. YEAH. KAYLA, DO YOU WANT SOME GLOVES? NO, I'M FINE. ALL RIGHT. AH, ROCKS! -WHOA! -ROCKS! [BLEEP] ROCKS, ROCKS, ROCKS, ROCKS! LOOK OUT. OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. ♪ GOD, I'D HATE TO PASS THIS AREA UP WITHOUT REALLY CHECKING IT OUT. Narrator: AT TWO FISH, FRED'S CREW IS DREDGING A GOLD TRAP. Fred: AH, ROCKS, ROCKS, ROCKS. [BLEEP] ROCKS, ROCKS, ROCKS! GET OUT. [BLEEP] HOLY CRAP. TURN THAT THING OFF. TURN THAT THING OFF. TURNED OFF. -WE ARE NOT IN A GOOD SPOT. -WHOA, WHOA. WHAT IN THE HELL IS THAT ALL ABOUT? BACK UP AWAY FROM THIS THING. Kayla: THAT WAS REALLY SCARY. NO, THEY'RE STILL COMING DOWN. WHAT THE HELL? DID WE HAVE A TREMOR OR SOMETHING? I DON'T LIKE THAT AT ALL. I SEE SOME HANGERS UP THERE THAT LOOK BAD. Narrator: ALASKA HAS OVER 30,000 EARTHQUAKES A YEAR. EVEN A MINOR TREMOR COULD TURN THE SHATTERED OVERHANGING CLIFF FACE INTO A KILL ZONE. Fred: WHAT THE HELL WE GONNA DO ABOUT THAT? I MEAN, WE WANT TO STILL DREDGE IN HERE. WELL, THE ONLY THING TO DO IS JUST TO REPEL DOWN AND SEE IF WE CAN KNOCK SOME OF THEM LOOSE. IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WANT TO DO IT, IT'S UP TO YOU. I THINK IT WOULD BE SAFER IF WE DID DO THAT. THAT'S JUST... IT'S SAVING SOMEBODY'S LIFE BECAUSE THAT'S ONE LESS ROCK THAT'S GONNA HIT SOMEBODY. LOOK, I'M JUST GLAD EVERYBODY IS OKAY. GEEZ. THAT'S THAT 800-POUND GORILLA THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT. THAT WAS REALLY CLOSE, LANDED WITHIN FEET OF PAUL AND KAYLA. WE WERE WORKING RIGHT STRAIGHT-UP UNDERNEATH TWO WALLS LIKE THAT. SOMETIMES YOU'RE GONNA GET A LITTLE TREMOR OR SOMETHING, A LITTLE EARTHQUAKE. SMALL ONES HERE, YOU DON'T EVEN HARDLY NOTICE THEM BUT ROCKS NOTICE IT AND IF THEY'RE TEETERING OFF-BALANCE, THEY FALL. JUST GLAD THAT NOBODY GOT HURT. ♪ THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO ANCHOR A ROPE, CLIMB DOWN THE SIDE OF THE HILL, KNOCK SOME OF THESE LOOSE ROCKS OUT, MAKE IT SAFER FOR US TO GET BACK AND FINISH DREDGING. LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS GET ANYBODY HURT OR KILLED. WHAT YOU DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT IS THE ONES THAT ARE ON TOP OF THE HILL THAT COULD COME DOWN ANYTIME, THE SILENT KILLERS, BECAUSE THEY COME DOWN AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT. ♪ WOW, LOOK AT THE STUFF COMING DOWN. Kayla: THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION ALL AROUND. THE SHELL ROCKS MAKES IT VERY DANGEROUS FOR PAUL. HE COULD SLIP, FALL, AND DIE. Fred: THERE'S A LOT MORE LOOSE MATERIAL UP THERE THAN I THOUGHT.

ANOTHER GOOD RAINSTORM OR EARTHQUAKE AND THAT'S... IT'S ALL COMING DOWN. I'D STILL LIKE TO MINE THIS. WELL, FRED, I MEAN, HE KEEPS SAYING BAD, BAD, BAD.
