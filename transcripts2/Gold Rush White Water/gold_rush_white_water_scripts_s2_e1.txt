I'D LOVE TO PULL UP ABOUT  A BUCKET OF GOLD, JUST A BIG,  BIG BUCKET OF GOLD. THAT WOULD MAKE MY YEAR. THAT WOULD MAKE MY 10 YEARS. Narrator: FIVE THOUSAND FEET UP  IN THE CHILKAT MOUNTAINS, A SERIES OF GLACIERS  ERODED GOLD FROM THE MOTHER LODE  OVER MILLIONS OF YEARS. MELTWATER CARRIED IT DOWNSTREAM AND DEPOSITED POCKETS OF GOLD  IN THE BENDS AND PLUNGE POOLS  OF THESE REMOTE, RUGGED CREEKS. A HUNDRED YEARS AGO, OLD-TIMERS HAULED NEARLY  80,000 OUNCES OF GOLD FROM THESE CREEKS WORTH TODAY ALMOST $100 MILLION. THE OLD-TIME MINERS COULDN'T  GET TO WHERE I'M DIGGING NOW. IT'S JUST TOO DAMN HARD. THIS YEAR, I'VE GOT MORE  EQUIPMENT AND MORE PEOPLE. WE'RE DEFINITELY GOING TO GET  DOWN TO THE JACKPOT.

ALL RIGHT? THIS IS DANGEROUS STUFF HERE.  -GOT YOU. IF YOU KNOCK A ROCK LOOSE,  YELL, "ROCK." OKAY.  ROCKS! ROCKS!

I'M ALL RIGHT. -WHOA.  -HOLY MOLY, THAT WAS CLOSE! HELL, THIS IS WHERE I WANTED  TO GO IN THE FIRST PLACE. WATCHING FRED WALK THIS HILL,  HE'S ALMOST 75 NOW, AND I'M JUST STARTING TO WONDER  HOW LONG HE CAN DO THIS STUFF, SO HOPEFULLY THIS YEAR  IS OUR YEAR TO HIT IT BIG. I'M $75,000 IN DEBT, AND IF I DON'T GET DOWN THERE  IN THE GOLD, I'M SCREWED. THE SOONER WE CAN GET STARTED,  THE BETTER. HOLY [BLEEP]. BRIDGE IS DOWN! Carlos:  OH, THAT DON'T LOOK GOOD. Man: WHAT THE HELL? -AW, IT SPLIT IN HALF, MAN!  -WHOA! -YEAH.  -THEY GOT OUR BRIDGE. WELL, WE GOT A LITTLE BUMP  IN THE ROAD, BUT HELL, THAT AIN'T  GOING TO STOP US. THAT IS NOTHING.

LAST SEASON, HOW MUCH GOLD  DID YOU GUYS GET? -WE GOT A COUPLE OUNCES.  -YEAH. I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO  COME BACK TO THIS PLACE, I MEAN, THE EXACT SAME SPOT  WHEN YOU GOT VERY LITTLE GOLD? WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE KNOW  THERE'S GOLD DOWN THERE. I'VE SEEN GOLD 15 FEET DOWN  IN THAT HOLE RIGHT UNDERNEATH THAT BRIDGE  AND A LITTLE BIT BACK. SOON AS WE GOT TO THE BOTTOM  OF THIS HOLE, WE STARTED FINDING  GOLD IMMEDIATELY. LIKE, IT JUST STARTED HAPPENING  JUST IMMEDIATELY. Narrator: LAST SEASON... LOOK AT THAT RIGHT THERE! ...AFTER 20 WEEKS  OF DREDGING... WOW. ...THE DAKOTA BOYS  HIT A PAY STREAK THAT PRODUCED HALF THEIR SEASON  TOTAL IN JUST 2 DAYS. -THAT'S INCREDIBLE.  -WHOA! -CLEAN THAT SUCKER OUT!  -WHOO!

Wes: MOTHER NATURE  KICKED OUR ASS LAST SEASON BUT NOT THIS SEASON. THAT'S MY DAUGHTER'S FRICKING  COLLEGE EDUCATION RIGHT THERE. THAT'S MY NEW HOME. I'M ITCHING TO GET IN THIS  [BLEEP] DAMN WATER.

Fred: I'M GOING TO HIT 75 THIS SUMMER. THIS IS GOING TO BE MY SUMMER. WE'RE GOING TO GET SOME GOLD. Narrator: UP AHEAD... WELCOME TO THE DEATH ZONE. YEAH, DUDE!

WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT  HOW TO GET ACROSS HERE. THAT'S THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. Narrator:  HIGH IN THE CHILKAT MOUNTAINS, THE DAKOTA BOYS RETURN  TO THEIR MINE SITE. Dustin: WE CAN MAKE  A WORKSTATION OFF OF THAT. Man: YEAH. IT LOOKS  PRETTY DANGEROUS TO ME. Narrator: THEY CAN'T DIVE  FOR GOLD UNTIL THEY REPAIR THE WINTER STORM DAMAGE. TO FIX THIS BRIDGE,  I NEED TO GET THE LINE ACROSS WHERE IT HANGS DOWN, AND WE CAN WORK OFF OF THAT  AND JACK UP THAT OTHER SIDE. WE'RE GOING TO USE THIS LINE AS A FRICKING ANCHOR TO... TO PICK UP ON IT  WITH COME-ALONGS AND THEN BOLT IT TOGETHER. Narrator: DUSTIN'S PLAN -- USE THE EXISTING CABLE  ACROSS THE CREEK TO ATTACH A LINE TO A RATCHET, THEN HOIST THE BRIDGE UP  SO IT'S LEVEL. NEXT, PULL THE SHORT BROKEN END  OF THE BEAM BACK INTO PLACE AND SECURE THE REPAIR  WITH FOUR WOODEN BRACES. WELCOME TO THE DEATH ZONE. THIS IS VERY EXTREME. WHOO. Carlos:  TAKE YOUR TIME, BROTHER. ALL RIGHT.  [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] UGLIEST KNOT I EVER DID TIE. WELL, I SET MY LINE, AND I THINK  I'M ZIP-LINING BACK DOWN. [ EXHALES SHARPLY ] A-FRICKING-MAZING, MAN. Narrator:  TO ATTACH DUSTIN'S ROPE, SOMEONE NEEDS TO CROSS  THE BROKEN BRIDGE. PAUL IS FIRST TO VOLUNTEER. -PAUL!  -NO MISTAKES! IF YOU FALL IN THAT WATER,  YOU'RE [BLEEP], MAN. THAT CURRENT AIN'T NO JOKE. IT'LL SPIN AROUND AND JUST BITE  [BLEEP] OUT OF YOU. ♪♪ WHOO! -IS THIS YOU?  -YEAH! -RIGHT HERE, RIGHT?  -YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT. Narrator:  NEXT, CARLOS MUST ATTACH THE  RATCHET LINE TO THE BRIDGE JUST INCHES ABOVE THE DEADLY  38-DEGREE MELTWATER. CAN YOU SEE WHAT'S BELOW ME? AND I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE,  BROTHER. LOOK AT ME,  [BLEEP] GETTING READY TO DIE. Dustin:  THAT'S A REALLY BAD SPOT  TO FALL, SO DON'T FALL. LIFT UP ON THAT THING. CAN YOU LIFT ON IT? ♪♪ -AH!  -AH! [BLEEP] YEAH!

GOT IT.  -CARLOS TIES A ROPE TOURNIQUET TO PULL THE TWO PARTS  OF THE BEAM TOGETHER. WHAT ARE YOU GOING  TO TWIST THAT WITH? A PIPE OR SOMETHING. YEAH, DUDE! THAT'LL HOLD IT. Dustin: GOING TO BRACE IT UP  WITH SOME BOARDS. WE'RE GOING TO PUT SOME BOARDS ON THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE. -THAT SHOULD BE IT, HUH?  -I THINK THAT'LL DO US. AH! TWO MORE BOARDS,  WE'LL BE DONE! THAT'S IT! ALL RIGHT!  WELL, WE GOT IT DONE. -GOOD JOB, GUYS.  -GOOD JOB, MAN. HELL YEAH! WE PUT IT RIGHT BACK TOGETHER  WITH BUBBLE GUM AND DUCT TAPE, BUT IT'S TOGETHER, AND IT'S  CROSSABLE, SO THAT'S A BRIDGE. I MEAN, THE REAL WORLD,  THIS IS A PIECE OF TRASH, BUT [BLEEP]  THIS IS BEAUTIFUL HERE, MAN. Narrator:  NEXT DAY, DOWN AT THEIR  BASE CAMP ON PORCUPINE CREEK... -SO DUCT TAPE IT.  -ALL RIGHT. -THAT SOUNDS...  -IT'LL GET US BY. Narrator:  ...FRED AND NEW GUY  RICH ARE REASSEMBLING THE DREDGE THEY USED  LAST SEASON. THIS IS THE OLD DREDGE THAT WE WERE USING, NICE AND COMPACT. BASICALLY, ALL THIS THING IS IS  A GIANT WATER VACUUM CLEANER. Narrator:  THIS SEASON, DUSTIN HAS  A SECRET WEAPON... OH, GET OUT OF TOWN, DUDE! ...A BRAND-NEW $17,000 DREDGE  CAPABLE OF PROCESSING 12 YARDS OF PAY DIRT AN HOUR, TWICE AS MUCH AS FRED'S OLD ONE. Carlos: THIS FRICKING SLUICE  IS FRICKING HUGE, MAN! FROM POINT A TO POINT B,  IT HAS ITS OWN ZIP CODE. NO GOLD IS EVER GOING  TO ESCAPE THIS. NO. HOW MUCH DIRT ARE WE GOING TO MOVE WITH [BLEEP]? I'M HOPING AT LEAST  TWICE AS MUCH. -GAH!  -THE DREDGE IS... IT'S BEAUTIFUL. IT'S ABOUT...  -GOD. ...THREE TIMES THE SIZE,  SURFACE SIZE. THIS FIXES ALL OUR PROBLEMS. WHAT THE HELL YOU GOT  OVER HERE ANYWAY? Dustin:  A GIANT-SIZED DREDGE. YEP.  STEP IT RIGHT IN. OUR SLUICE BOX IS JUST ABOUT THE  SAME SIZE AS YOUR FULL DREDGE. BIGGER ISN'T NECESSARILY BETTER. Dustin:  FRED WON'T ADMIT IT, BUT HE WANTS TO WORK  OFF OF THIS MACHINE. HE'S LOOKING AT HIS LITTLE,  BITTY TOY OVER THERE, AND HE'S FEELING  A LITTLE INADEQUATE. THERE IT IS. AND WE'RE READY TO GO. IT'S GOING TO MAKE ME  SOME GOLD NOW. ALL WE GOT TO DO IS GET  IT UP THERE AND GET STARTED. Narrator:  WITH TWO DREDGES THIS SEASON,  FATHER AND SON WILL BE WORKING  TOGETHER SIDE BY SIDE. THESE ARE DUSTIN'S CLAIMS. TECHNICALLY, I'M WORKING FOR HIM  BUT BASICALLY AS A... MAYBE I'LL BE AN OLD SAGE, AN ADVISOR OR SOMETHING  OF THAT NATURE. Dustin: A LITTLE BIT  OF LUMBER COMING. Wes: EVENTUALLY,  WE'RE GOING TO NEED IT. FRED, THAT'S NOT JUST A LITTLE BIT OF LUMBER, MAN. WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS, THAT I DIDN'T WANT YOU BUILDING A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF. I DON'T UNDERSTAND.  -I JUST SAID... NO, NO.  I'M NOT... SO IF YOU NEED PIECES OF LUMBER,  HOW DO YOU GET THEM OUT THERE...  -WHAT DO I NEED... -...CARRY THEM?  -...LUMBER FOR, FRED? THERE'S NOTHING ON THE OTHER  SIDE OF THE CREEK TO EVEN WALK ON. EVERYTHING IS...  -WE'RE NOT BUILDING... -...LIKE THIS.  -...THIS YEAR. WE'RE NOT BUILDING. HOW ABOUT IF I JUST LEAVE ALL OF  THAT SITTING RIGHT THERE, AND YOU PAY  THE HELICOPTER BILL WHEN WE HAVE TO HAVE IT  OUT THERE? WATCH YOURSELF DOWN THERE. WELL, I'M JUST PLANNING AHEAD. Dustin: FRED IS GOING TO DECK  THE ENTIRE CREEK IF I LET HIM, AND WE'RE NOT BUILDING  A WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF. IT'S NOT HAPPENING THIS YEAR, AND WE'VE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS, AND HE DECIDED  HE WAS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BUY THE LUMBER ANYWAY. OKAY.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HE'S GOT NO RIGHT TO DO  ANY OF THIS STUFF. YES, SIR.  YOU TOO. HE DON'T OWN ANYTHING.  HIS NAME IS ON NOTHING. IT'S JUST, SOMEHOW,  HE THINKS HE'S IN CHARGE, AND THIS IS WHERE WE GET INTO  TROUBLE, BUT I'M IN CONTROL. IT'S NOT GOING UP THERE. ♪♪ SO TODAY WE'VE GOT A HELICOPTER  COMING SO WE CAN... WE'RE GOING TO LIFT ALL OF  OUR STUFF INTO THE DIVE SITE. I SPENT EVERY DIME  I COULD ON THIS STUFF, AND I'M JUST WORRIED THAT THE  HELICOPTER LIFT MAY GO WRONG, AND MY DREDGE  MIGHT GET DESTROYED, AND THAT'LL BE THE END  OF EVERYTHING HERE BECAUSE I CAN'T BUY ANOTHER ONE. I JUST NEED IT TO GO OKAY.  WHO KNOWS? HOPEFULLY, FRED DOESN'T  MESS THIS UP FOR ME. ♪♪ I'LL TAKE THESE THINGS OFF  SO THEY DON'T GET HUNG UP ON ANYTHING. WE WOULD BE IN SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE IF WE SMASH THIS. YOU BETTER NOT SMASH IT. THIS IS OUR $17,000 DREDGE. YOU DROP THIS THING OUT OF THE  SKY, AND WE'RE JUST GOING HOME. OH, LORD. BIG DAY. WE GOT HELICOPTER FLIGHTS TODAY. WE'VE GOT PROBABLY ABOUT A HALF  A DOZEN OR SO LOADS TO HAUL OUT OF HERE. WE GOT TWO DREDGES. WE GOT FUEL TO TAKE OUT THERE. WE HAVE BASKETS. WE HAVE MATERIALS. WES, DON'T LET HIM BRING UP THAT LUMBER, MAN. WE DON'T NEED IT UP THERE. PLEASE.  -OKAY. I'LL DO MY BEST. THE LUMBER NEEDS  TO STAY DOWN HERE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPACE  FOR IT UP THERE. Wes: ALL RIGHT.  SEE Y'ALL IN A FEW. Narrator:  DUSTIN, CARLOS, AND PAUL  HEAD TO THE DIVE SITE, LEAVING FRED  IN CHARGE OF LOADING. ♪♪ Fred: IT'S MARY!  HOW YOU DOING? HEY, FRED.  HOW'S IT GOING? LONG TIME, NO SEE.  -THAT'S IT! IT'S BEEN ABOUT A YEAR  OR TWO AT LEAST... -YEAH, NO KIDDING.  -...SINCE THE LAST TIME. WE HAVE PROBABLY A HALF  A DOZEN DIFFERENT THINGS. -OKAY.  -WE'VE GOT THAT DREDGE. -OKAY.  -WE HAVE A BIG ONE OVER HERE. OH, OKAY. THAT PARTICULAR UNIT IS GOING  TO LAND IN THE WATER, AND DUSTIN WILL DIRECT YOU WHERE  HE WANTS TO LAND THAT THING. YOU GUYS HAVE TAG LINES ON THAT  SO THE GUYS CAN... THERE'S GOING TO BE A TAG LINE  ON IT TO GRAB IT. -YES.  -YOU HAVE NETS? I DO HAVE NETS.  I BROUGHT TWO NETS. OKAY, TWO NETS, GREAT. Mary: I LIKE SLINGING  BECAUSE I LIKE THE CHALLENGE, BUT IT DOES REQUIRE  PRACTICE AND PATIENCE. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD. THERE'S OUR FIRST LIFT. -THERE YOU GO!  -ALL RIGHT. Fred: CLEAR! WHOO-WEE! GOOD, SMOOTH LIFT. THAT IS BADASS. Narrator:  THE ONLY WAY TO GET EQUIPMENT  TO THE REMOTE MINE SITE IS A 2-MILE FLIGHT THROUGH NARROW MOUNTAIN CANYONS. Man: HERE WE GO! WHOO-HOO! Man: THINGS ARE GETTING REAL, BROTHER! Mary:  DUSTIN, I GOT ONE MORE NET LOAD  FIRST AND THEN THE DREDGES. Dustin: COPY THAT. ON THE WAY!  OVER THERE! OVER THERE! YEAH! WATCH YOURSELF! -I GOT IT!  -YEP. -OH, THAT WENT BEAUTIFULLY.  -THAT WAS A GOOD LIFT. Man:  THAT WAS PERFECT! Dustin:  JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IS HERE. NOW IT'S TIME  TO GET THE DREDGES.

RIGHT NOW, OF COURSE,  THE DREDGES ARE OUR MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS. -HERE SHE COMES.  -ALL RIGHT! GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!  GO, GO, GO!

Fred: [ Over radio ]  THE EAGLE HAS LANDED. YES.  -THAT'S PERFECT, MAN! ALL RIGHT, GUYS! PARKER TIME! Man: BIG DREDGE NEXT! Fred: BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. MOVE IT FORWARD! MOVE IT FORWARD! Narrator:  DUSTIN'S NEW DREDGE WEIGHS  1,800 POUNDS. LOOSEN IT UP. HE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO LAND IT DIRECTLY IN THE RAGING WATER OF THE CREEK BECAUSE IT IS TOO HEAVY  TO LIFT BY HAND. IDEALLY, I WANT IT RIGHT  THERE AGAINST THAT WALL. I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.  I AIN'T GOING TO LIE. YEP!  THAT LOOKS GOOD! Fred: ALL RIGHT!  LET'S GO. WHOO, COME ON! WHERE'S YOUR TAG LINE? Wes:  THEY DIDN'T WANT A TAG LINE. THEY WANT TO HOOK IT UP. I WANTED TO PUT A TAG LINE.  THEY DIDN'T... WHERE THE HELL IS THE TAG LINE? THEY DIDN'T WANT ME  TO PUT A TAG LINE. BULL[BLEEP]. THAT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO. THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING  OF THEIR OWN PLANNED. SO HOW ARE THEY GOING TO  HOOK UP A THING OUT THE MIDDLE OF THE WATER?  -I DON'T KNOW. I THINK THEY HAD PLANNED  TO HAVE THEIR ROPES TIED OFF ON THE SIDES, AND AS SOON AS IT SAT DOWN, THEY WERE GOING TO GO OVER THERE AND JUST CLIP IT  WITH CARABINERS. WELL, THAT'S THE WRONG  THING TO DO. THAT'S THE WRONG THING TO DO. Dustin: YEAH, MARY, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU  TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT  THAN WE PLANNED. I'M STANDING OVER ON LAND  WITH TWO LINES, AND I'M GOING TO HOOK INTO IT  UPSTREAM ACROSS THE CREEK. Mary:  COPY THAT. I WILL HOLD IT WHILE YOU  ATTACH A LINE AND THEN SET IT  UPSTREAM FROM YOU. THAT'S CORRECT. Narrator:  WHEN THE DREDGE ARRIVES, DUSTIN WILL ATTACH  TWO TAG LINES. THE LINES ARE ANCHORED  TO PULLEYS ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE CREEK  TO PREVENT THE RAGING CURRENT FROM RIPPING THE $17,000  DREDGE DOWNSTREAM. WE'VE NEVER LANDED A DREDGE  IN THE WATER OUT THERE BEFORE. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS  THAT COULD GO WRONG. PAUL, I NEED YOU BACK  OVER HERE NOW, NOW! GO OVER HERE!

WHAT A [BLEEP] RUSH! WHOO. Dustin:  SO DID YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED? WHEN I CLIPPED, IT MISSED  AND WENT INTO THE WATER, AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO. THERE'S ONLY ONE ROPE  ON THIS THING, AND AND I'VE LOST  MY FRICKING MIND. SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS GOING TO WASH DOWN  THE DAMN CREEK." OH, MY GOD. PAUL HAD TO TAKE UP  ALL THE SLACK.

LOOK AT IT!  -YEP. Paul:  IT'S NEVER BEEN THIS CLEAR. THAT IS THE BEST THAT'S EVER GOING TO LOOK RIGHT THERE. Dustin: MAKE NO MISTAKE,  I AM IN A HURRY, BUT THAT IS THE ONE ROCK,  I THINK, THAT IS DANGEROUS. GOT TO MOVE THE DEATH ROCK  BEFORE WE GET IN THE WATER. WE'RE GOING TO PUT  THIS WINCH UP HERE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING  TO MOVE A ROCK. HOLD ON.  HOLD ON. -ALL RIGHT.  -JUST HOLD ON. THE KILLER ROCK DOWN THERE,  THE SECOND ONE FROM THE WALL, IF THE CURRENT COMES UP  WHILE YOU'RE DOWN IN THE HOLE AND WE LEAVE IT THERE  AND IT MOVES JUST A LITTLE BIT AND DECIDES TO JUST ROLL  INTO THE HOLE WHERE YOU'RE AT, YOU'RE DEAD. YOU'LL NEVER KNOW YOU WERE DEAD. Narrator:  DUSTIN'S PLAN -- DRILL ANCHOR  BOLTS INTO THE 3-TON BOULDER AND ATTACH A LINE SO THEY CAN WINCH  THE KILLER ROCK SAFELY OUT OF THEIR DIVE SITE. WHOO!

Dustin:  HEY, JUST SMILE AND SAY, "HEY, LOOK HOW [BLEEP]  GOOD THAT LOOKS." Fred: NOT LONG ENOUGH! NOT LONG [BLEEP]  ENOUGH, THAT LONG! Dustin: DOESN'T MATTER! WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE. Fred: I JUST SAW HIM PUT IN A  SHORT ANCHOR BOLT THERE, BUT WHAT WE REALLY NEED  IS ABOUT A 12-INCH-LONG ANCHOR INSTEAD OF ABOUT A COUPLE  OF 8-INCH ONES, MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE  ON THE STRENGTH OF THOSE BOLTS.
