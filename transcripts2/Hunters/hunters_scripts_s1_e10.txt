 But these are six for 49 cents. These are five for one dollar. - I know, that's cucumber. - That's too much. Yeah, you'd think that'd be cheaper, wouldn't you? It wouldn't be five for a dollar. You'd think you'd get, like, ten for a dollar. - I'm gonna maybe make a pie. - Mm. I'm gonna try this. - I'm going to get a, um... - (bell tolling in distance) ♪ ♪ Let's go, Jonah.

 We need to go. (classical music playing quietly) Buying cantaloupes... at the market... as if he belonged in this world. Well, I'll make any calls I need to make. My contacts will be made aware. I'll get the mayor himself involved. You say his office didn't take your calls. No. Well, you'll be assured that when I ring they will take mine. I wouldn't have come if I had anywhere else to go. I am delighted that you're here.

 30 years and here you are. It's bashert. I read about you in the papers over the years. Yeah. Hmm. And now actually being here in this... in this big room... Well, it's a bit bigger than our flat on Boston Street. Yes? It's bigger, but... but it's emptier, too. You know, it's one of the horrors of war, the way you remember people. For me, I lost all the-all the photographs of my father and my mother. They're reduced to little memories now. Just his chin and her eyelashes. A freckle... my mother. I can see just her freckle. But you... you, I thought, I thought I could never forget. And somehow you look... you look different than I remember. We got old, Ruth. We did. Mm. We got tired. That's true. We've changed. What a thing. What a thing. I've been seeing this, look. My awful handiwork, yeah? Mm. Yes, your awful handiwork. It extends beyond the ink and deeper than the skin, Meyer. I often thought about this day, because I had so many things I wanted to say to you. So many things. And I take the bus. I traveled all these blocks, all these years. And now I'm here. And it's so hard for me to... I felt such sadness when you left because of what you thought that creature made you do. But just a letter and a necklace? Why couldn't you share your grief with me? I wanted to, but, uh... If we shared the weight... I don't know. It would somehow feel heavier. When Naomi was born, our beautiful daughter, um, all this sadness that I was feeling, it turned to anger. She was yours. How could you have left? I lived through the war, too, Meyer. Why was I left to raise her alone? Ruth, please. Please. When she died, all of the light left my world. And soon I felt nothing. And why should I? What was there to feel? Oh, did you know that she died, our daughter? Did you know? I did. Ah. And why didn't you come for me? Because you know the things I've done. Yes, I know the things that you've done for me. To save my life, I know the things you've done. When our daughter died, a new light came into my life, her boy, Jonah. And I felt again. I felt that, with this little boy, I felt everything would be all right. This is your grandson I'm talking about. And, unfortunately, he looks like you. Not the hair or the eyes, but he has the light. He has the light that you once had. And I won't let them extinguish it. Not the man in the market, not anybody. Not like they did to you, Meyer. I'll protect him forever. I... I don't know why I told you any of these things. I... I won't say any more. Then, uh, perhaps we can just sit here, Ruth, quiet. In the silence, and just... What do you think? What a big room this is. What a big, empty room. What a thing, Meyer. What a thing. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ (wind whistling) ♪ ♪ (engine rumbling) (engine stops) (car door closes) (water rushing) Meyer! (panting) ♪ ♪ (panting) (coughing) I'm here, Meyer. I've got you. Meyer.

And you single-handedly burned down a factory filled with Nazis before they could put out a virus in... corn syrup. That's right. All because you old, white assholes brought these Nazis here, Linda Lovelace-ing their Wiener schnitzels across the sea. That's quite a silver tongue you got in that mouth - of yours, Morris. - Thank you. It's not as big as the silver spoons in yours, gentlemen. The thing is, sweetheart, it all comes down to proof. And all you've got is a burned-down factory and the murder of a neighborhood kid at a comic shop. The rest is hearsay. Like little green men at Area 51. Agent Grimsby will vouch for it all. Well, Agent Grimsby retired this morning, dear. Seems to have packed up and left town. And, gee, try as we may, we can't, for the life of us, locate him. NSA OFFICIAL: Thank you for coming in, Agent Morris. We appreciate your... your view on the events. Oh, and, uh... (clears throat) You will keep this quiet.

I'll just leave. - I'll go, that's fine. - That's... - Eh... - (chuckles) What? I thought... it was you. What are you talking about? Harriet's too... uh, impulsive. And Lonny is too daft. And...

To lead The Hunt. To lead it. I-I-I don't understand. Did I do something wrong? What did I do wrong? I don't get it. You should've killed him, Jonah. You had the chance. Killed him? Killed him. Millie was right there. She was right there. - She was five feet away from me. - Excuses. He's-He's in... He's in prison now. He's behind bars... So was The Wolf... behind bars. But wait. He's going to fester in there and he will be out again before you know it. Jonah. Such a beautiful boy. I thought you were like me. (inhales sharply) But I see clearly. You are a boy. Just a boy. - No. No, you're wrong. - Yes. I can, I can do what is necessary. I... I can lead The Hunt. I can be whatever the fuck I need to be. - I can do that. - But you weren't. - When it counted most, you weren't. - How was I supposed to know? How am I supposed to know that? - This whole time, I was... - Words are small. Deeds are giant. Meyer, if you just listen to me. Just hear me out. My perspective on this. Words are small. Deeds... are giants. Can you just... can you...? - I wish to be alone now. - But can you just...? I need to be alone now. Go. Let... me rest. ♪ ♪ CHEEKS: Boom. (The Velvet Underground's "Oh!

Crunchy autumn leaves. The Golden Gate Bridge, pumpkin pie. For Buddhists, the color of illumination. The highest state of perfection. For Hindus, the shade of the holy wanderers. And in Elizabethan England, it was reserved only for nobles. Part red, part yellow. Neither fully kings nor fully peasants. How odd. Mm. So... black jester, what are you doing here at my throne? I'm here to make you an offer. Leniency for the murder of the young man at the comic book shop if you agree to testify about the Fourth Reich. They're silencing you, aren't they? So... I'm your last chance. To prove your story. And so you wish to make a trade. Gosh. If only the Jew boy could hear you pledging to reduce my sentence. (laughing) He would be oh so disappointed. Thing is... ...I'm not gonna tell some black, mongoloid bitch anything at all. Well, I guess it's your loss. Oh, Millie? (chains jangle) I am so glad that I let you live outside that toy shop. Because one day, when I'm covered in your girlfriend Maria's blood, and I have a knife... the same knife I used to slice her into pieces... pressed against your throat, you're gonna look back and realize you should've let the kid kill me the other day. Boy, I hope I remember to bring my Polaroid camera, because the look on your face is one I'm gonna want to put in my memory book.

The Wolf. RUTH: We heard stories that the Allies were close. - (wind whistling) - (man shouting in Russian) And then they came, the angels in green. And for the first time in years, - we tasted freedom. - (fly buzzing) (woman crying) (indistinct chatter) RUTH: And there, since that night he sacrificed his world for mine, I saw him again. Meyer. (laughs) (crying): Meyer. What? ♪ ♪ Oh. Oh. RUTH: My Meyer. Oh. A bag of bones and flesh. (indistinct chatter) (woman crying) And then we saw him. Our monster, our golem, The Wolf finally arrested by the Soviets. We spent months recuperating in the Displaced Persons camp, while the Nazis rotted in the cells across the camp. And here he was... my love, this man of light... now darkened. - He suffered the same nightmare, - (whimpering) night after night. What is it? What is it? - (groans) - (quietly speaks Polish) Ah. (sighs) The same dream... I march to his cell, across camp. I pull him into the woods, I set The Wolf on his knees and... and... I say the Kaddish prayer for him... Why? Why waste your breath saying the prayer for this man? Why show the monster mercy at all? I must pray for him... before I kill him. It's the monsters among us... who deserve prayer most of all... And then I kill him... I take him from this world... so he is nothing... so he is shum da-var... (mumbles) RUTH: The Wolf forever wished to be Meyer. He learned everything there was to know about him. Except the things that couldn't be taught. And because he couldn't become him, he tried to kill what made Meyer so special: his soul, his light. RUTH: Oh. (speaks Polish) And in that moment I realized The Wolf had succeeded. (cries) And so I made myself a pledge that I carry to this day, years after Meyer left me and ran off that fateful November 4: I will find The Wolf and I will deliver justice until he is nothing. For this is a duty of the past. This is a matter of the soul. Matter of the soul. Matter of the soul. A matter of the soul. RUTH: Go on. Eat some of this. It heals all aches of the body and all matters of the soul. Mmm. You should write that down in one of your cookbooks. Matter... You should write that down in one of your cookbooks.

Even my office is bigger than this shoebox. Manhattan is just not what it was, huh? You should really come on over to Brooklyn. MORRIS: I'm sorry, what are you doing here? I heard about your testimony today about these so-called Nazis running among us. Look, if you're here to tell me to keep quiet, - I think you wasted a trip. - I am here to tell you I heard you, Agent Morris. I know all about Operation Paperclip. I know about Agent Grimsby. I know about Nazis living in the States. I'm one of a few Jews in Congress, an institution built for white skin and blue blood. A long time I've been searching for a way to bring these people to justice. I think my search is over. Well, listen, I didn't set out to hunt fuckin' Nazis. I was following a case, tracking a murderer, and there are men in the halls of these institutions who are complicit, who have aided and abetted war criminals. That is the fight that I need to take. That's a fight you'll lose. I'm offering you another path. To hunt the monsters themselves. To create a task force to locate and prosecute Nazis in the U.S. and abroad. I'll wrangle funding. It'll be under the radar. No one will know about it except you and me and a team of your choosing. It would be fitting, wouldn't it? A black woman and a Jewish broad being the stuff of Nazis' nightmares. So... what do you say? - ♪ ♪ - (quiet, indistinct chatter (quietly): Oh. - (door opens) - NURSE: Hunter Smith for Dr. Mann?

You had the same nightmare every night. You told my safta. It was in her letters. When you found him, you must pray for him before you-you kill him. You said that. - Well, of course, but... - Well, what? How... What, you don't remember? Jonah... You had the same nightmare every night. How do you not remember that? But it was a long time ago, kindeleh. The... You know, when you're older... ...harder to remember. No. The prayer. Why didn't he know the prayer?

We needed more time. How? How? How is it... What the fuck did you do? Tell me. Tell me. What the fuck did you do? The Soviets had taken over the camp, and they were gonna hang me. I found a way to get out of the cell. But I needed the papers to escape, so I... I snuck into the tent where... where the man I came to know better than anyone was, uh... And you k... you-you killed him? Is that... is that what you're gonna say? You killed him, right? Say it. Say it. I killed him. Right where he slept. I took him outside to the woods. And then, uh... I buried him there. And, what, what, what, you just walked out of there? You just took his papers? You took his name? You just walked right out of there? I left your safta his necklace. Then wrote her a note, um, as Meyer that I couldn't be with her anymore because she was there when I had killed the 11 men. And I c... No, no. You... - What? - You have the tattoo. The-the... the scar. I did them myself. With, um, one of them... penknives and ink. You did that yourself? And I managed to escape to Berlin. But, on the streets, a survivor recognized me. Started to scream. I, um, got away, but... I knew I... The name of Meyer was not gonna be enough. I had to do something else. I had to become... him. I went to an SS surgeon, who happens to be... this man who sits dead before us. I transferred to this man my entire savings, and he gave me a mask, which... - is what you see today. - And you... and, what, you just... You came to America as Meyer Offerman. Everything that you told me. You told me all this... Everything that you said... every-every story, - every-every blessing. - All true, Jonah. No, no, but they're his. They're his to tell. They're-they're his to give. They're not yours. Well, I was... They're not yours. They don't belong to you. I was there. I saw. It wasn't enough for you to f... Get the fuck away from me! Wasn't enough for you to torture him? To force him to kill, then kill him. You take his heart, his soul, his fucking blood. Me, my safta. You had to... Was this a fucking game for you? It wasn't a game, Jonah. It was... 30 years I lived as a Jew, I saw as a Jew, I thought as a Jew. You know, I finally woke from the coma of hatred, and I saw the evil I had done to your grandparents... ...and realized that I was the villain of my own story. You don't recover from that. Want me to take fucking pity on you? I don't give a shit what the fuck you went through. You're a fucking Nazi. I'm not a Nazi. Of course you're a fucking Nazi. I was never a Nazi. No matter what. The Reich was nothing to me. You think I cared for the ideology? Then why? Why the fuck did you do it? No, I was a surgeon. And they gave me power. To run their laboratory. And with the power they gave me... Power breeds evil, and the evil consumed me. You saw the evil that you did. You saw it, and you kept going. You kept playing that fucking part. - You loved it. - I didn't love it. You loved all this shit, didn't you? You can't know what a hell it was to be Meyer. Hell? Hell? I had a mother. I had a father. I was a person, too. I had to kill the person I was and be Meyer. Hell... living like a fucking king. It was hell for you. Yeah, building all this on his fucking name, - on his grave. - I didn't plan it, you know, all this. I came to America. The Jewish organization got me here, got me a, uh... a job at a factory. A factory. You're a surgeon working at a fucking factory. I couldn't be a surgeon, Jonah. I couldn't tell 'em what I really was. That would contradict all the lies I've told. I had to commit to the whole Jewish faith. I studied Hebrew. I went to... temple. Read the Torah. I did it all, you know? I became a Jew. No, you're not a fucking Jew. No. A little over a year ago... ...there was a knock at my door. It was your safta. And she came into the room. She, of course, th-thought I was Meyer. She showed me the light. And she inspired The Hunt. And from that moment, she became my savior, because she gave me the opportunity to finally do something that was right, to-to finally grow a little bit closer to the light. And, what, what, you thought it your redemption or some shit? - What? No. No. - Huh? You thought y-y... - No? No? Good. - Please, Jonah. No, I don't look for redemption! - You'll never get redemption. You'll never get absolution. - I don't want redemption! - You'll never get forgiveness. - I don't seek it! I don't deserve it! The Hunt is my penance, because it gives me purpose, finally. In The Hunt, I find myself. I'd kill for The Hunt. I will die for The Hunt. The Hunt isn't yours. It doesn't belong to you. Who does it belong to, then? It belongs to the 11 million who cry out from their graves for justice, that's who. It belongs... to Ruth. It belongs to Meyer. It belongs to me. - You? Hmm? - Yeah. By what right? - Birthright. - Birthright? Yeah. Birthright. You turned away from The Hunt the first time you heard about it. You took the easy way out. Who was it that got you back? Me. How could you be trusted to do what is necessary? 'Cause my grandfather did. 'Cause my safta did. And they're part of me. They are me. Do you want to kill me? You want to become the leader of The Hunt? You'll have to do what is necessary, and you can't, can you? Because you need me. No, I don't fucking need you. - Yes, you do. You do. - I don't fucking need you. - Who am I? If I don't do this, - Hmm? If I don't do this, who am I? Who? You're a boy. That's who you are. You didn't even bring me The Wolf. You brought me a goddamn surgeon. I fucking found you. I found you. - Jonah, don't let this man destroy your life, too. - You. What are you gonna do? You destroyed my fucking world. Oh, I destroyed your world? You were a schvantz kid running around the streets. I gave you the world. What are you doing? You're gonna do something with that? Jonah, he wants you to kill.

See that you do, Rebekah. Your intel helped net quite a feast, dear. The new dossier should have just arrived to you. I should go. How is he... the boy? He's... Well, you'll see for yourself soon enough. ROXY: Joe's place was all packed up. I thought he would've told me, but I guess he, uh... ...found a way out. Mindy, too.

They're in boardrooms, they're in politics. Seeping in. This is why we have to do what we do. This is why we have to do what is wrong. Because if not us, then who? (sighs) This can't happen again. Never again. Agent Morris... she's gonna be on us, on us every step of the way. She will hunt us while we hunt them. Then perhaps we don't hunt them in America. My contact sent a dossier. Die Spinne, they called it. A highly covert operation in which eight of Hitler's highest-ranked lieutenants... the leaders of the Nazi regime... were shuttled out of Nazi Germany and disappeared into Europe. So, you twats, perhaps it's time we take our expertise across the pond... ...and kill these fucking shites of the Round Table. Yeah, I could definitely use a getaway. Let's find these fascist fucks.
