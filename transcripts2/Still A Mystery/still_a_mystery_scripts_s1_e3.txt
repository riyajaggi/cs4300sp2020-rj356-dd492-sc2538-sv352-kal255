 SHE ENJOYED THAT TRIP VERY MUCH. SHE WAS HAVING A GOOD TIME AND I WAS GLAD. Narrator: NO ONE COULD FORESEE THAT IT WOULD BE THE LAST TIME ANYONE WOULD EVER HEAR FROM HER. I THINK ABOUT HER ALMOST EVERY DAY. I CAN STILL HEAR HER LAUGH AND THAT SMILE. Narrator: THE MYSTERY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO FLORIDA INSURANCE AGENT CARLA STEFANIAK BEGINS WITH HER BIRTHDAY IN NOVEMBER 2018. LIKE, SHE CELEBRATED HER BIRTHDAY ALL MONTH LONG. SHE WANTED TO HAVE A BIRTHDAY TRIP EVERY YEAR. TRAVELLING WAS HER PASSION, SO THAT WAS ONE THING SHE MOST ENJOYED, AND HER DREAM WAS TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD. Narrator: FOR HER 36th BIRTHDAY, CARLA HEADS TO COSTA RICA, A PICTURE-PERFECT PLACE WITH EXOTIC JUNGLES AND VOLCANOES, NIGHTLIFE, BREATHTAKING BEACHES. SHE WAS VERY -- I WOULD SAY, EVEN ADDICTED TO HER CELLPHONE, TO HER SOCIAL MEDIA, SO SHE HAS FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, AND SHE LOVED PICTURES AND VIDEOS AS WELL. - YOU GOT IT? - [ SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] WE WOULD TRAVEL TOGETHER, AND SHE WOULD RECORD EVERYTHING. I'M LIKE, "ARE YOU, LIKE, RECORDING A MOVIE RIGHT NOW?" BECAUSE, LIKE, SHE WOULD, LIKE, MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD FOOTAGE, YOU KNOW, FOR INSTAGRAM, FOR LIFE, FOR, LIKE, LAUGHING LATER ON. Narrator: JOINING CARLA IS HER SISTER-IN-LAW APRIL. THEIR ADVENTURE UNFOLDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA MOMENT BY MOMENT. SHE WAS HAVING SUCH A GREAT TIME THERE. CARLA TOOK A SURFING CLASS IN COSTA RICA. SHE LOVED IT. SHE WENT TO, LIKE, LITTLE TOWNS BY THE OCEAN. EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE WORKING OUT GREAT. WE KEPT PERMANENT COMMUNICATION, SENDING ME PICTURES, SOME VIDEOS. SECOND DAY, THE HOT SPRINGS. Carlos: EVERYDAY IN THE MORNING, THE AFTERNOON. Narrator: CARLA AND APRIL FLY HOME SEPARATELY, AND CARLA SPENDS THE LAST DAY IN COSTA RICA ALONE. APRIL LEFT COSTA RICA ON THE 27th AND CARLA'S SCHEDULE IS THE NEXT DAY, SO DIFFERENT SCHEDULE. ALSO, DIFFERENT AIRLINES. Narrator: NOVEMBER 27th, CARLA'S LAST DAY, IS JUST AS ANYONE WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE. SHE DROPS APRIL AND THE RENTAL CAR OFF AT THE SAN JOSE AIRPORT, THEN SHE GETS A TOUR OF DOWNTOWN SAN JOSE FROM AN UBER DRIVER. SHE ARRANGES FOR THE SAME DRIVER TO PICK HER UP AT 8:30 THE NEXT MORNING FOR HER RETURN FLIGHT TO FORT LAUDERDALE. BY 5:00 PM, SHE CHECKS INTO HER ROOM CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT. IT'S IN A GATED COMPLEX THAT USES AIRBNB TO RENT OUT ITS ROOMS. IT HAS GREAT REVIEWS, A GORGEOUS VIEW, AND GUARDS, SO CARLA BELIEVES IT'S SAFE. SHE WAS FEARLESS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, SHE TOOK HER PRECAUTIONS. IT'S NOT LIKE, YOU KNOW, SHE JUST VENTURED AND STAYED, YOU KNOW... - WHEREVER. - YEAH, WHATEVER. SHE WAS GONNA STAY THERE FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY. THAT'S IT. AND THEN JUST GO TO THE AIRPORT THE NEXT DAY AND CATCH HER FLIGHT BACK HOME. Narrator: AT FIRST, CARLA SEEMS HAPPY WITH THE VILLA. SHE SENT PICTURES OF THE PLACE, AND THEN SHE WAS TELLING SOME OF HER FRIENDS THAT IT WAS RAINING, BUT THE PLACE WAS STILL BEAUTIFUL. Narrator: BUT THEN, THE POWER GOES OUT. SHE TEXTED APRIL AROUND 7:00, 7:30 P.M. THAT THE POWER WENT OUT. SHE EVEN SENT PICTURES OF THAT WHEN THE POWER WENT OUT AND THEN THE POWER CAME BACK ON. SHE SAID THE PLACE WAS SKETCHY. Narrator: IN THE PITCH-BLACK DARKNESS, CARLA SEEMS RATTLED. SHE TELLS HER FRIEND KEITH THAT SHE NEEDS A BOTTLE OF WATER. KEITH TOLD HER "NO MOVE FROM THE PLACE. STAY HERE. TRY TO FIND WATER IN THE SAME PLACE." SHE TOLD HER FRIEND LAURA THAT SHE WOULD COME OUTSIDE AND ASK THE GUARD WHERE SHE COULD GET SOME WATER. THAT WAS AROUND 8:58 P.M. OF THAT NIGHT. Narrator: THEN CARLA'S COMMUNICATIONS ABRUPTLY STOP. HER FRIENDS ASSUME SOMETHING'S HAPPENED TO HER PHONE. IT WAS EITHER TURNED OFF OR DIED OR THE ELECTRICITY WENT OUT. SOMETHING HAPPENED, BUT SHE LOST CONNECTION. Narrator: IT SOUNDS LIKE A SCENE FROM A SCARY MOVIE -- STRANGE PLACE, FLICKERING LIGHTS, POWER GOING OUT AT NIGHT, NO COMMUNICATION. BUT BECAUSE SHE'S DUE HOME IN LESS THAN A DAY, CARLA'S FAMILY TRIES TO REMAIN CALM. IT WAS RAINING STRONG, AND THE POWER, YOU KNOW, SHE WAS VERY SCARED. BUT WE THOUGHT THAT SHE GOT OUT THE BEDROOM, MAYBE LOOKING FOR THE GUARD OR WHATEVER, TO DRINK WATER. ♪ Narrator: THE NEXT MORNING IS CARLA'S ACTUAL BIRTHDAY -- NOVEMBER 28th -- BUT SHE'S UNCHARACTERISTICALLY SILENT, AND THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY, HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY SENSE SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT. WE STARTED SENDING HER MESSAGES -- "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" -- TEXTING HER, CALLING HER, AND SHE WOULDN'T ANSWER. AND THAT'S NOT HER BECAUSE SHE'S THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT GOES TO SLEEP, THAT CHECKS HER PHONE BEFORE SHE CLOSES HER EYES, AND THE MINUTE THAT SHE OPENS HER EYES, THE FIRST THING THAT SHE CHECKS IS HER PHONE. I SAW THAT HER LAST LOG-IN IN WhatsApp WAS LIKE AT 8:40 OR 9:00 P.M. YOU KNOW, I WENT TO INSTAGRAM TO SEE THE LAST TIME THAT SHE HAD SEEN ALL THE POSTS, AND THEN I CHECKED FACEBOOK AND SAME, AND I'M LIKE "THIS IS VERY WEIRD." I TEXTED HER, "HI. "HOW ARE YOU? "CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY. "GOD BLESS YOU. PLEASE TALK TO ME." SHE NEVER ANSWERED ME. Narrator: CARLA'S LONGTIME FRIEND LAURA IS SUPPOSED TO PICK HER UP FROM THE FORT LAUDERDALE AIRPORT, BUT SHE'S ANXIOUS. WILL CARLA SHOW UP OR NOT? SO, I GOT TO THE AIRPORT, AND I'M JUST THERE, LIKE, WAITING, AND EVERYBODY CAME FROM THAT FLIGHT WAS OUT ALREADY, AND I ASKED A LADY THAT WORKED AT THE AIRPORT -- I'M LIKE, "I NEED TO UNDERSTAND IF THIS PERSON WAS IN THAT FLIGHT." AND SHE'S LIKE, "WELL, NO, SHE NEVER BOARDED THE PLANE." Narrator: AT THIS POINT, NO ONE HAS HEARD FROM CARLA IN 21 HOURS. HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE PANICKED. CARLA ISN'T THE TYPE TO GO DARK. AND EVERYBODY STARTED FREAKING OUT AND "SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?" Narrator: WITHIN HOURS, CARLA'S FAMILY CALLS THE COSTA RICAN AND U.S. POLICE, BUT SINCE CARLA IS OVER 18 YEARS OLD, SHE MUST BE MISSING FOR 48 HOURS BEFORE AUTHORITIES CAN OFFICIALLY CALL HER DISAPPEARANCE A MISSING PERSONS CASE. AT THAT POINT, THEN WE JUST STARTED, LIKE, YOU KNOW, LOOKING FOR HER EVERYWHERE POSSIBLE. Narrator: CARLA'S FRIENDS AND FAMILY IMMEDIATELY MOBILIZE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE JUST SPREAD OUT THE WORD THAT SHE WAS MISSING, SPREAD OUT PICTURES OF HER, AND, YOU KNOW, JUST HOPE THAT SOMEBODY SEES HER AND SAYS SOMETHING. Narrator: WITHIN DAYS, CARLA'S DAD, ONE OF HER BROTHERS, AND A FRIEND ARE ON THE GROUND IN COSTA RICA. THE FAMILY DECIDED THAT MY BROTHER, CARLOS, WOULD GO TO COSTA RICA ALONG WITH GREG, WHICH IS A FAMILY FRIEND. Narrator: ON SATURDAY, DECEMBER 1st, FOUR DAYS AFTER CARLA GOES MISSING, CARLA'S BROTHER VISITS THE VILLA WHERE SHE STAYED. Mario: THE OWNERS WERE RECEPTIVE, AND THEY JUST SHOWED MY BROTHER THE ROOM WHERE SHE WAS STAYING AT. EVERYTHING WAS JUST NICE AND NEAT. Narrator: THE STAFF INFORMS THEM THAT A GUARD SAW CARLA LEAVE VERY EARLY ON THE MORNING OF HER BIRTHDAY. IT'S THE FIRST SIGN OF HOPE. THAT SHE LEFT ABOUT 5:00, 5:15 IN THE MORNING IN A DARK GRAY OR BLACK CAR. SHE PUT INSIDE THE LUGGAGE ON THE TRUNK, AND THEY LEFT. Narrator: THE NEXT STEP FOR CARLA'S FAMILY IS TO LOCATE THE UBER DRIVER CARLA BOOKED TO TAKE HER TO THE AIRPORT. THROUGH HER E-MAIL, WE GOT THE DRIVER'S INFORMATION, SO THE POLICE CONTACTED THIS GUY. Narrator: WHAT POLICE DISCOVER IS SHOCKING. THE UBER DRIVER TELLS THEM THAT HE NEVER PICKED CARLA UP BECAUSE SHE WASN'T THERE. UBER RECORDS CONFIRM HIS ACCOUNT. HE ARRIVED AS PLANNED AT 8:30 A.M., WAITED, BUT LEFT WHEN A GUARD TOLD HIM THAT CARLA WAS PICKED UP AT 5:00 A.M. SOMETHING DOESN'T ADD UP. SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANY REASONS TO WAKE UP AT 5:00 AND THEN LEAVE AT 5:10, 5:20 A.M. THAT'S JUST NONSENSE AND SHE'S NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT WAKES UP EARLY. SO THAT'S WHEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED TO HER. Narrator: COSTA RICAN POLICE DON'T CONSIDER THE UBER DRIVER A SUSPECT, SO CARLA'S FAMILY PLEADS WITH AUTHORITIES TO HELP THEM GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS. THE PRESSURE WAS VERY STRONG, AND WE TALKED WITH SENATOR MARCO RUBIO'S OFFICES IN ORLANDO, AND FINALLY, THE FBI HELPS COSTA RICA POLICE ON THIS CASE. SHE NEVER LEFT THE PLACE. SHE NEVER LEFT THE PLACE. Narrator: BUT IF CARLA NEVER LEFT THE VILLA, THEN WHY IS THE ROOM WHERE SHE STAYED COMPLETELY CLEAN, AS IF IT'S BARELY BEEN USED? ACCORDING TO THE OWNERS, CLEANING LADY THAT WENT TO CLEAN THE ROOM THE NEXT DAY SAID THAT THE ROOM WAS TOTALLY NORMAL, NOTHING WRONG. SO, THE ROOM WAS CLEAN AND THEY RENTED IT THE NEXT DAY. Narrator: CARLA HAS TRULY VANISHED. HER FRIENDS AND FAMILY BEGIN TO FEAR THE WORST. WE REALLY THOUGHT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND CRAZY STUFF IN CENTRAL AMERICA. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT HAPPENED? MY GOD. DESPERATE. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHAT FAMILIES AND RELATIVES GO THROUGH WHEN SOMEONE GOES MISSING, NOT KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED, OR EVEN IF SHE'S STILL ALIVE AND SHE NEEDS YOU AND SHE NEEDS HELP. Narrator: WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO CARLA? SECOND DAY. THE HOT SPRINGS. Narrator: WORLD TRAVELLER CARLA STEFANIAK CELEBRATES HER 36th BIRTHDAY WITH A TRIP TO COSTA RICA, A COUNTRY KNOWN FOR ITS ECO-TOURISM AND BEAUTIFUL JUNGLES. BUT WHEN SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT HOME TO FLORIDA, HER FAMILY FEARS SHE'S BEEN KIDNAPPED. ON SOCIAL MEDIA, THEY LAUNCH A DESPERATE SEARCH WITH THE HASHTAG #FINDINGCARLA. Laura: WE PUT ALL OUR TIME, RESOURCES, WE STOPPED DOING LIFE AND JUST FOCUSED ON LOOKING FOR HER. THERE WAS NOT, LIKE, SLEEPING, NO EATING. WE JUST FOCUSED, FOCUSED, FOCUSED. Narrator: FINALLY ON DECEMBER 3rd, 2018, SIX DAYS AFTER CARLA GOES MISSING, INVESTIGATORS STEP THINGS UP. THEY INSPECT CARLA'S ROOM MORE CAREFULLY, WITH CHEMICALS AND SCENT-DETECTING DOGS. WHAT THEY FIND IS DISTURBING. THERE WERE TRACES OF BLOOD EVERYWHERE IN THIS ROOM. THE DOGS, THEY SMELL THE BLOOD, AND SO THAT MEANS SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THIS PLACE. Narrator: EVEN MORE TROUBLING, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WENT TO GREAT LENGTHS TO COVER IT ALL UP. THEY SAID THAT THIS ROOM WAS CLEANED WITH BLEACH AND VINEGAR SEVERAL TIMES TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE IT AS IT WAS. Narrator: CARLA'S FAMILY IS FORCED TO FACE THEIR WORST NIGHTMARE. MAYBE SHE WAS MURDERED. Narrator: A FEW HOURS LATER, THEY GET DEVASTATING NEWS. THERE IS STILL NO OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION THE BODY FOUND IN COSTA RICA IS THAT OF STEFANIAK. Narrator: COSTA RICAN POLICE DOGS DISCOVER A HALF-NAKED BODY PARTIALLY WRAPPED IN PLASTIC. THEY FOUND A BODY, 1,000 FEET AWAY FROM THE AIRBNB WHERE SHE WAS STAYING AT, BUT WE HAD TO WAIT FOR FORENSIC TESTS TO HAVE CONFIRMATION THAT IT WAS HER. Narrator: AUTHORITIES SUSPECT IT'S CARLA, BUT THEY NEED A POSITIVE I.D., SO HER FATHER AND BROTHER ARE FACED WITH THE HEARTBREAKING TASK OF GOING TO THE MORGUE TO MAKE THE OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION. AND... I DIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT IT, THEN I CRIED SO MUCH. I WAS JUST... I WAS IN SHOCK. I WAS VERY, VERY DEVASTATED. ♪ Narrator: CARLA'S BODY INDICATES A VIOLENT END. SHE SUFFERED BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA TO HER HEAD AND WAS SLASHED NUMEROUS TIMES WITH A KNIFE. KNIFE CUTS ON THE FACE, TOO, AND THE NECK. TOO MANY CUTS WITH KNIFE. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW HARD THAT WAS. Narrator: BUT WHO WOULD DO THIS TO HER AND WHY? SHE FOUGHT VERY HARD, VERY HARD. Narrator: POLICE THEORIZE THAT CARLA WAS MURDERED IN HER ROOM, THEN HER BODY WAS TAKEN TO THE WOODS AND DISCARDED. THEY SUSPECT SHE WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. AND WITH HER LAPTOP, PHONE, WATCH, AND PASSPORT ALL FOUND SCATTERED ON THE GROUND, ROBBERY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A MOTIVE. HER BELONGINGS WERE FOUND, AND SHE WAS FOUND HALF-NAKED. SO, THEY TOLD US THAT SHE HAD BEEN KILLED BECAUSE OF SEXUAL REASONS. Narrator: WHATEVER THE MOTIVE FOR HER MURDER, CARLA'S FAMILY IS DISTRAUGHT. I THINK THESE COWARDS, WHOEVER ATTEMPTED AGAINST MY SISTER, WENT AFTER HER BECAUSE SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL AND SHE WAS ALONE, AND OBVIOUSLY THESE PEOPLE ARE SICK MINDS AND CRIMINALS. SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BRING ME TO THE CEMETERY, NOT ME HER TO THE CEMETERY, NO. Narrator: ON THE SAME DAY CARLA'S BODY IS DISCOVERED, INVESTIGATORS ARREST A SECURITY GUARD AT THE VILLA, A 32-YEAR-OLD IMMIGRANT FROM NICARAGUA. THIS GUARD LIVED AT THE PLACE, WORKED AT THE PLACE, AND HIS ROOM WAS ROOM NUMBER 7. MY SISTER'S ROOM WAS NUMBER 8. Narrator: HE'S IN COSTA RICA ILLEGALLY, AND HIS STORY ISN'T ADDING UP. HE WAS THE ONE WHO LIED ABOUT MY SISTER LEAVING AT 5:00 A.M. ON THE 28th, AND HE WAS AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FROM NICARAGUA. SO, THEY CALL THIS A FLIGHT RISK, THAT THIS GUY CAN JUST ESCAPE BACK TO NICARAGUA. SO, THAT'S WHY THEY ARRESTED THIS PERSON. Narrator: SOMEONE IS BEHIND BARS, BUT CARLA'S FAMILY IS CONVINCED THAT HER MURDER WAS NOT THE WORK OF ONE PERSON. WHOEVER KILLED MY SISTER COULD NOT HAVE ACTED ALONE. PERSON-TO-PERSON. IMPOSSIBLE. DOMINATE CARLA. IMPOSSIBLE. I AM SURE THERE WAS MORE THAN ONE PEOPLE. Narrator: AND CARLA'S FAMILY AREN'T THE ONLY ONES WHO BELIEVE THIS THEORY. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] Narrator: CARLA'S FAMILY INSISTS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ONLY ONE PERSON TO DRAG HER MUSCULAR, 200-POUND BODY 1,000 FEET INTO THE WOODS. IT'S A BIG JOB, MOVE THE BODY 1,000 FEET AWAY. IMAGINE 200 POUNDS IN THE HILL WITH A LOT OF TREES, STUFF LIKE THAT. ONE PERSON? NO. TWO? NO. AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR. Narrator: AND WHAT ABOUT THE CLEANLINESS OF THE CRIME SCENE? BUT THE GUARD THE POLICE HAVE ARRESTED ISN'T TALKING, AND CARLA'S FRUSTRATED LOVED ONES ARE LEFT WITH MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS. WHAT KIND OF EVIL HAS TAKEN THE LIFE OF THEIR VIVACIOUS WORLD TRAVELER? - YOU GOT IT? - [ SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE ] Narrator: CARLA STEFANIAK, WHO WAS KNOWN FOR HER SPIRITED ENERGY AND DETAILED TRAVEL BLOG, IS FOUND MURDERED IN COSTA RICA. POLICE BELIEVE SHE WAS BRUTALLY ATTACKED AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN HER ROOM, AND THEN THE KILLER TRIED TO COVER IT ALL UP. THAT WAS HORRIBLE. THIS CRIME WAS TERRIBLE, HORRIBLE. Narrator: POLICE ARREST A GUARD, BUT HE CLAIMS THAT ALTHOUGH HE KNEW ABOUT THE MURDER, HE DIDN'T PARTICIPATE IN IT, AND WHAT HE REVEALS NEXT IS DISTURBING. [ SPEAKING SPANISH ] SO, DID SOMEONE TRY TO LURE CARLA INTO PARTICIPATING IN SOMETHING SHE WANTED NO PART OF? THEY TRIED TO CONVINCE CARLA TO SEX, STUFF LIKE THAT. "YOU HAVE TO." MAYBE SHE SAID, "NO, NO." BECAUSE SHE WAS AN INNOCENT PERSON. SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL, YES, ALWAYS. Narrator: POLICE DID RECOVER DNA FROM CARLA'S BODY, BUT THEY HAVEN'T REVEALED ANYTHING ELSE. CARLA'S FAMILY IS NOT ONLY SAD, THEY'RE FRUSTRATED. THE GUARD REMAINS IN CUSTODY, BUT HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER. CARLA'S FAMILY BELIEVES HER KILLERS ARE STILL OUT THERE. Mario: WE WILL FIND YOU. DOESN'T MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES. BUT WE WILL FIND THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE, AND YOU WILL PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO MY SISTER. Narrator: CARLA'S FAMILY HAS FILED A WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT AGAINST BOTH AIRBNB IN THE U.S. AND THE VILLA WHERE SHE STAYED IN COSTA RICA, ARGUING THAT BOTH COMPANIES COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO PROTECT GUESTS. AS THE MURDER INVESTIGATION CONTINUES, CARLA'S FRIENDS STRUGGLE WITH THE PAINFUL REALITY THAT THEIR BELOVED DIVA IS GONE. Laura: HER LOVE FOR LIFE WAS SO CONTAGIOUS. YOU KNOW, SINGING CARDI B, LIKE, IN THE LIVING ROOM AND JUST, LIKE, WEARING ALL HER BIG HOOPS LIKE THIS ONE AND, LIKE, BRIGHT SMILE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, RED LIPS. YEAH. SHE WAS REALLY AMAZING. SHE REALLY WAS SPECIAL. SHE REALLY WAS SOMETHING ELSE. CARLITA. WE'RE HERE TO CELEBRATE YOU. Narrator: AND WHAT HURTS HER LOVED ONES THE MOST IS THAT CARLA DIED SO YOUNG AND SO VIOLENTLY ON HER BIRTHDAY, AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME TIME SHE WAS BORN. SHE WAS BORN ABOUT 1:10 A.M. ON NOVEMBER 28th, 1982. SO, SHE WAS MURDERED THAT NIGHT ABOUT MIDNIGHT. WE ALL FEEL, LIKE, THIS EMPTINESS IN OUR HEARTS. WE FEEL LIKE SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT IS MISSING, AND IT'S JUST DEVASTATING. SECOND DAY. THE HOT SPRINGS. Narrator: WILL THERE EVER BE JUSTICE FOR CARLA? ♪ WHILE CARLA'S FAMILY WAITS FOR ANSWERS, ANOTHER FAMILY IN ILLINOIS HAS BEEN FIGHTING TO SOLVE A TRAGIC MYSTERY SINCE 2014. ♪ LATE ONE NIGHT, 19-YEAR-OLD STUDENT PRAVIN VARUGHESE MAKES A STRANGE PHONE CALL TO HIS FRIEND. HE TOLD HER, "ANITA, DON'T HANG UP." AND SHE HEARD SOME ARGUMENT, SOME SCUFFLE, AND SHE THOUGHT SOMEBODY WAS RUNNING. Narrator: IT'S THE LAST TIME ANYONE EVER HEARS FROM HIM. ♪ PRAVIN IS A POPULAR COLLEGE SOPHOMORE AT SOUTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY. HE'S THE KIND OF OUTGOING PERSON EVERYONE LOVES. HE WAS THE MOST GIVING PERSON THAT YOU WANT TO MEET. HE WANTED PEOPLE AROUND HIM TO BE HAPPY, SO HE WOULD DO ANYTHING TO MAKE EVERYONE LAUGH. Narrator: PRAVIN HAS BIG GOALS FOR HIS FUTURE. HE WANTS TO BE A POLICE OFFICER. HE'D ALWAYS JOKE AROUND WITH MY MOM, SAYING THAT WHEN HE BECOMES A POLICE OFFICER THAT SHE'S GONNA BE THE FIRST ONE HE'S GONNA ARREST. Narrator: AND HE LIVES BY THE MOTTO "YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE." HE ALWAYS SAID "YOLO." YOLO! YOLO! Narrator: PRAVIN'S MYSTERY BEGINS ON THE NIGHT OF WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 2014. HE PLANS TO ATTEND A PARTY OFF-CAMPUS AND THEN MEET UP WITH HIS ROOMMATES LATER AT A LOCAL BAR. BUT THINGS DON'T GO AS PLANNED. PRAVIN NEVER ARRIVES AT THE BAR. HE MAKES THE TROUBLING CALL TO HIS FRIEND AT 12:29 A.M., AND THEN THE LINE ABRUPTLY GOES SILENT. THE NEXT NIGHT, PRAVIN'S PARENTS GET A DISTURBING CALL FROM THE POLICE IN CARBONDALE, ILLINOIS. Lovely: AND I SAID, "IS EVERYTHING OKAY, SIR?" AND THAT'S WHEN HE SAID, "YOUR SON HAS BEEN REPORTED MISSING." ♪ AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT PHONE CALL IN MY LIFE. THAT CHANGED EVERYTHING. Narrator: THEY IMMEDIATELY JUMP IN THEIR CAR TO MAKE THE SIX-HOUR DRIVE FROM CHICAGO TO SIU. HE'S NOT THE KIND OF PERSON THAT WOULD JUST GET UP AND DISAPPEAR. THAT'S NOT HIS CHARACTER. I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. I KNEW SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY BABY. Narrator: ON FEBRUARY 12, 2014, 19-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE STUDENT PRAVIN VARUGHESE NEVER SHOWS UP TO MEET HIS ROOMMATES AT A BAR OFF-CAMPUS. HE IS MISSING. HIS DISTRESSED PARENTS DRIVE SIX HOURS FROM CHICAGO TO CARBONDALE, ILLINOIS, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, HOPING TO GET SOME ANSWERS. BUT WHEN THEY GET THERE, POLICE DON'T SEEM CONCERNED. I STILL REMEMBER ONE OF THEM SAYING, "DON'T WORRY. ALL COLLEGE KIDS DO THIS." I SAID, "NO, NOT OUR SON." Narrator: PRAVIN'S FAMILY'S FRUSTRATIONS QUICKLY MOUNT. SIU DID NOT SEND OUT A MASS TEXT TO ITS STUDENTS TO ALERT EVERYONE, "HEY, WE'VE GOT A MISSING STUDENT. EVERYBODY START TALKING." IF THIS WAS A WHITE MALE, THERE WOULD BE HELICOPTERS FLYING 24/7 UNTIL THEY FOUND HIM. Narrator: ON FEBRUARY 16th, FOUR DAYS AFTER PRAVIN GOES MISSING, HIS FAMILY RECEIVES MORE TERRIBLE NEWS. THE POLICE TAKE A DAY OFF FROM SEARCHING, STATING THAT IT'S A SUNDAY AND THEY'RE SHORT-STAFFED. HOW CAN THEY IGNORE A WHOLE DAY? STILL HURTS ME. STILL HURTS ME TO THINK THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN HAVE A SEARCH ON SUNDAY. Narrator: FEELING HELPLESS, PRAVIN'S FAMILY POSTS A $15,000 REWARD FOR INFORMATION. THEN, ON FEBRUARY 18th, SIX DAYS AFTER HE GOES MISSING, THEIR WORST FEAR IS CONFIRMED. PRAVIN WAS FOUND DECEASED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:45 A.M. THIS MORNING. I HAD HOPE THAT HE WOULD BE FOUND ALIVE. Narrator: A TIPSTER COMES FORWARD AND TELLS POLICE WHERE TO FIND PRAVIN'S BODY -- DEEP IN A WOODED AREA 300 YARDS FROM THE NEAREST ROAD. THAT DID IT TO ME. THAT MOMENT DID IT TO ME. I JUST STARTED SCREAMING. Narrator: BUT WHEN PRAVIN'S MOM ASKS TO SEE THE SPOT WHERE HER SON'S BODY WAS FOUND, POLICE WON'T TAKE HER THERE. THEN, THE RESULTS OF THE AUTOPSY COME IN. THE CORONER CONCLUDES THAT PRAVIN DIED OF HYPOTHERMIA. HE FROZE TO DEATH. AS SHOCKING AS THAT NEWS IS, WHAT HURTS THE MOST IS THAT PRAVIN'S FAMILY ISN'T ALLOWED TO SEE HIS BODY, SOMETHING THAT STUNS MONICA ZUKAS, A LOCAL RADIO HOST AND VICTIMS ADVOCATE. THEY HAD TO FIGHT AND SCREAM AND CAUSE A SCENE TO GET TO VIEW THEIR SON'S DECEASED BODY. WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT PRAVIN'S MOM IS A NURSE, AND WHEN SHE IS FINALLY ALLOWED TO SEE HER SON, SHE'S HORRIFIED. I SAID, "SOMEBODY BEAT MY BABY. WHO BEAT HIM?" Narrator: AND THE INCONSISTENCIES DON'T STOP THERE. THEY SAID, "HE WAS FOUND FACE-DOWN. IT'S FROSTBITE." BUT THE NEXT DAY, THEY SAID HE WAS ON HIS BACK. Narrator: THE FAMILY QUESTIONS THE ACCURACY OF THE AUTOPSY REPORT, AND WHEN PRAVIN'S BODY ARRIVES IN CHICAGO, THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR HAS CONCERNS AS WELL. A 30-YEAR VETERAN OF THE FUNERAL HOME INDUSTRY SAID, "THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHERMIC BODY. HE HAS INJURIES." SO, THEY COMMISSIONED A SECOND PATHOLOGIST. Narrator: THE SECOND AUTOPSY CONCLUDES THAT THE CAUSE OF PRAVIN'S DEATH ISN'T HYPOTHERMIA, IT'S BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD. TWO DIFFERENT AUTOPSIES, TWO DIFFERENT STORIES. ANGRY AND CONFUSED, PRAVIN'S MOTHER IS DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO HER SON. A WOUNDED MOM IS THE BEST INVESTIGATOR. SOMETHING IN ME WOKE UP. I SAID, "MY ENGLISH IS BROKEN, MY ACCENT IS BAD, BUT I AM GOING TO TALK." Narrator: THE POLICE REVEAL THAT THE TIPSTER GOT HIS INFORMATION FROM A MAN NAMED GAEGE BETHUNE. GAEGE IS THE TIPSTER'S COUSIN, AND HE ATTENDED THE SAME PARTY AS PRAVIN THE NIGHT HE DIED. BUT GAEGE ISN'T AN SIU STUDENT. AS SOON AS I HEARD THE NAME, I STARTED ASKING MY SON'S FRIENDS. NOBODY KNEW HIM. Narrator: IT TURNS OUT THAT GAEGE HAS LIVED IN CARBONDALE ALL HIS LIFE AND HAS DEEP ROOTS IN THE TOWN. GAEGE BETHUNE COMES FROM A GOOD FAMILY. HE'S A YOUNG MAN WHO CONDUCTS HIMSELF WITH A MATURITY FAR BEYOND HIS YEARS. HE WAS ALSO A 19-YEAR-OLD KID. ACTUALLY, HE AND PRAVIN'S BIRTHDAYS ARE THREE DAYS APART. Narrator: POLICE BRING GAEGE BETHUNE IN FOR QUESTIONING. HE REVEALS THAT ON THE NIGHT OF THE PARTY, HE GAVE PRAVIN A RIDE BECAUSE PRAVIN WAS SO DRUNK, HE COULDN'T FIND HIS OWN WAY HOME. GAEGE CLAIMS THEY GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT GAS MONEY, WHICH TURNED VIOLENT. DURING THE SCUFFLE, HE SAYS THEY ROLLED DOWN A HILL THAT LEADS TO A DENSELY WOODED AREA. GAEGE SAYS THE FIGHT ENDED WHEN PRAVIN RAN OFF INTO THE DARK WOODS, AND THAT AFTERWARDS, HE MUST HAVE FROZEN TO DEATH IN THE COLD. UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS A STORY AS OLD AS TIME. SOMETIMES YOUNGSTERS, THEY DON'T REALLY APPRECIATE THE DANGERS OF THE OUTDOORS. ♪ Narrator: LOVELY ATTEMPTS TO SPEAK TO THE STATE'S ATTORNEY, BUT DOESN'T GET THE ANSWERS SHE'S HOPING FOR. 80, 85 MINUTES THAT HE TALKED TO ME, HE BASICALLY ATTACKED PRAVIN. HE SAID, "YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD A MODEL SON. "HE'S NOT THE MODEL SON YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD. HE WAS INVOLVED IN MANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES." Narrator: LOVELY IS TOLD HER SON MUST'VE BEEN TOO INTOXICATED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. ON TOP OF THAT, AT A PRESS CONFERENCE, INVESTIGATORS SAY THERE'S NO SUSPICION OF FOUL PLAY. BUT MONICA ZUKAS EXPRESSES HER CONCERN. I HEARD SEVERAL STATEMENTS THAT I KNEW WERE INACCURATE. Narrator: THINGS JUST AREN'T ADDING UP. PRAVIN'S FRIENDS TELL HIS FAMILY THAT THE BAR WHERE HE WAS GOING TO MEET THEM WAS JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM THE PARTY. HE WAS PLANNING TO WALK. HE DIDN'T NEED A RIDE. Lovely: PRAVIN WALKED EVERYWHERE. PRAVIN NEVER GETS A RIDE, LET ALONE TALK TO A STRANGER FOR A LONG TIME AT THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND ASK HIM FOR A RIDE AND GET INTO THE CAR AND GO SOMEWHERE. THAT WASN'T HAPPENING. WE KNEW IT. Narrator: WHAT'S MORE, PRAVIN WAS FOUND BAREFOOT. IF HE RAN INTO THE WOODS, AS GAEGE BETHUNE CLAIMED, WHERE WERE HIS SHOES? HIS FEET AREN'T SCRAPED, THEY'RE NOT SCRATCHED, THEY'RE NOT BRUISED. HOW WOULD HE HAVE TRAVELED HIMSELF THAT FAR INTO THE WOODS WITH NO SHOES ON WITHOUT HURTING HIS FEET? Narrator: EVEN MORE TROUBLING IS THAT WHEN PRAVIN'S TOXICOLOGY REPORT COMES BACK, IT'S NEGATIVE. WHEN PRAVIN'S TOX CAME BACK CLEAR WITH ZERO DRUGS AND ZERO ALCOHOL, THAT INFURIATED ME. Narrator: MONICA REACHES OUT TO PRAVIN'S FAMILY. SHE'S A MOM, TOO, AND SHE WANTS TO HELP PRAVIN'S MOM UNCOVER THE TRUTH. I KIND OF TOOK THE MENTALITY OF "IF YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO MESS WITH HER, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH ME FIRST." THERE IS NOTHING A MOTHER WOULDN'T DO FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THERE WAS NO WAY ANYBODY WAS EVER GONNA TALK ME OUT OF FINDING OUT ANSWERS. NOBODY. Narrator: IN FEBRUARY 2014, AFTER HE GOES MISSING FOR SIX DAYS, 19-YEAR-OLD PRAVIN VARUGHESE IS FOUND DEAD IN THE WOODS IN THE SMALL COLLEGE TOWN OF CARBONDALE, ILLINOIS. THE OFFICIAL CAUSE OF DEATH IS HYPOTHERMIA, BUT HIS FAMILY DOESN'T BUY IT, ESPECIALLY AFTER THEY GET A SECOND AUTOPSY, WHICH DETERMINES PRAVIN DIED FROM BLUNT-FORCE TRAUMA TO THE HEAD. I KNEW SOMETHING HAPPENED TO MY BABY. Narrator: POLICE QUESTION GAEGE BETHUNE, WHO ATTENDED THE SAME PARTY AS PRAVIN THE NIGHT HE DIED AND SAYS HE GAVE HIM A RIDE. HE ADMITS TO HITTING PRAVIN IN THE FACE AFTER THEY ARGUED ABOUT GAS MONEY AND THEN GOT IN A FIGHT. BUT THE ILLINOIS STATE'S ATTORNEY DOESN'T FILE ANY CHARGES AGAINST BETHUNE, AND HIS ATTORNEY MAINTAINS THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH PRAVIN'S DEATH. ABSOLUTELY A TRAGEDY, BUT AN ACCIDENT. Narrator: THEN, LESS THAN 48 HOURS AFTER PRAVIN'S BODY IS FOUND, MONICA ZUKAS RECEIVES A SHOCKING TIP ON SOCIAL MEDIA. A YOUNG LADY ON FACEBOOK MADE A POST THAT SHE KNEW A STATE TROOPER WAS ON THE "SCENE" THAT NIGHT. Narrator: IT TURNS OUT THAT ON THE NIGHT OF PRAVIN'S DEATH, AN ILLINOIS STATE TROOPER SAW GAEGE BETHUNE. HE PULLED OVER AND SPOKE TO GAEGE, WHO WAS STANDING NEXT TO THE WOODS WHERE PRAVIN'S BODY WAS LATER DISCOVERED. NO ONE TOLD US ABOUT THE STATE TROOPER. Narrator: PRAVIN'S FAMILY IS FURIOUS. THE TROOPER EVEN HAS VIDEO FROM HIS DASHBOARD CAMERA SHOWING GAEGE COMING OUT OF THE WOODS. THE TROOPER BRIEFLY SHINES HIS FLASHLIGHT INTO THE WOODS, BUT THAT'S IT. HE LEAVES THE SCENE, AND SO DOES GAEGE BETHUNE. ♪ THEN, ANOTHER TWIST -- GAEGE CONFESSES TO LYING ABOUT WHAT HE TOLD THE STATE TROOPER THAT NIGHT, THAT A BLACK MAN HAD JUST TRIED TO ROB HIM. EVEN THOUGH HE ADMITS TO LYING TO THE STATE TROOPER, GAEGE IS NEVER ARRESTED OR NAMED AS A SUSPECT. INSTEAD, HE PRESENTS HIMSELF AS SOMEONE WHO WAS ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP PRAVIN THE NIGHT HE DIED. Man: GAEGE BETHUNE DESCRIBED HIMSELF TO POLICE AS A GOOD SAMARITAN. GAEGE VIRTUALLY BEGGED THIS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO GO SEARCH FOR THE PASSENGER OF HIS VEHICLE THAT RAN INTO THE WOODS. Narrator: BUT NOT EVERYONE BELIEVES THE IDEA THAT GAEGE IS A GOOD SAMARITAN. THERE'S EVEN SPECULATION THAT BECAUSE GAEGE BETHUNE KNOWS SO MANY PEOPLE IN CARBONDALE, MAYBE HE'S GETTING SPECIAL TREATMENT. THERE'S A VERY BIG CHANCE THAT STATE TROOPER KNEW MR. BETHUNE OR HIS DAD. Narrator: GAEGE'S ATTORNEY SAYS HE'S BEING UNFAIRLY ATTACKED. THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID ABOUT GAEGE IN THE MEDIA HAVE ZERO BASIS IN FACT. Narrator: BUT PRAVIN'S FAMILY IS CONVINCED THAT SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT, AND WITH MONICA'S HELP, THEY BEGIN STAGING PROTESTS. THEY ALSO PETITION FOR THE RELEASE OF THE CASE FILES THROUGH THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT. WE FILED FOIA MULTIPLE TIMES. EVERY TIME WE FILED FOIA, IT WAS BEING DENIED BY THE STATE'S ATTORNEY. HE SAYS THERE'S AN OPEN INVESTIGATION. Narrator: THEN, IN MARCH 2015, MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER PRAVIN'S DEATH, THE STATE'S ATTORNEY SUDDENLY RECUSES HIMSELF AND ASSIGNS A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO THE CASE. AND THE NEW SPECIAL PROSECUTOR GRANTS PRAVIN'S FAMILY ACCESS TO THE FILES THEY'VE BEEN PLEADING TO SEE. IT WAS A HUGE, HUGE TURNING POINT FOR US. Narrator: WHEN THEY OPEN THE FILES, SOMETHING INSTANTLY CATCHES THE ATTENTION OF PRAVIN'S FAMILY. THEY HAVE A PIECE OF SURVEILLANCE CAUGHT ON A MOTION SENSOR OF A BUILDING, A WHITE MALE, WHAT LOOKS TO BE A LOT LIKE MR. BETHUNE, CARRYING ANOTHER PERSON ACROSS THE STREET. Narrator: ALARMED, LOVELY AND MONICA IMMEDIATELY BRING THE VIDEO TO THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR'S ATTENTION. WE'RE TWO MOMS THAT SAID, "NO. NOT TODAY. YOU'RE NOT SWEEPING HER BABY'S CASE UNDER THE RUG." Narrator: BUT THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE IS GRAINY, AND THE TWO MOMS ARE TOLD IT'S INCONCLUSIVE. ♪ ♪ FOR TWO YEARS AFTERWARDS, THINGS REMAIN AT A STANDSTILL. THEN, IN JULY OF 2017, THERE'S AN UNEXPECTED, STUNNING DEVELOPMENT. GAEGE BETHUNE IS CHARGED WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEATH OF PRAVIN VARUGHESE. Narrator: A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR ANNOUNCES THAT THERE'S ENOUGH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE TO CHARGE GAEGE WITH PRAVIN'S MURDER. THEY INTERVIEWED MORE PEOPLE, THEY GOT MORE EVIDENCE, AND THAT BROUGHT THE CHARGE. Narrator: IN JUNE 2018, MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AFTER PRAVIN'S DEATH, GAEGE BETHUNE GOES ON TRIAL. THE PROSECUTION ARGUES THAT GAEGE BEAT PRAVIN SO BADLY THAT HE BECAME DISORIENTED AND THEN DIED IN THE WOODS, BUT THE DEFENSE MAINTAINS THAT GAEGE DID NO SERIOUS HARM TO PRAVIN. GAEGE WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF, THE VERY LIMITED MARKINGS AND BRUISINGS ON PRAVIN'S BODY WERE NOT SEVERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE HIM TO BE INCAPACITATED IN ANY WAY. Narrator: THEN, TO EVERYONE'S SURPRISE, GAEGE TAKES THE WITNESS STAND. THE FACT THAT GAEGE BETHUNE TESTIFIED WAS THE SHOCK OF THE CENTURY. Narrator: UNDER OATH, GAEGE ADMITS THAT HE DIDN'T JUST HIT PRAVIN IN THE FACE, HE HIT HIM IN THE HEAD. Monica: PEOPLE WERE DROPPING LIKE FLIES IN THE COURTROOM. HE TOOK THE STAND. HE SAID IT. ANY NORMAL PERSON WHO IS HEARING ALL THIS EVIDENCE WOULD SEE THAT HE DID IT. Narrator: ON JUNE 14th, AFTER A WEEK-LONG TRIAL, THE JURY FINDS BETHUNE GUILTY OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. PRAVIN'S FAMILY IS ELATED, BUT THAT FEELING DOESN'T LAST LONG. THREE MONTHS LATER, ON SEPTEMBER 17th, THE MORNING OF GAEGE BETHUNE'S SENTENCING, THEY NOTICE SOMETHING STRANGE WHEN HE WALKS INTO THE COURTROOM. I SEE GAEGE WALK IN IN STREET CLOTHES AND NO HANDCUFFS. I THOUGHT, "WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE?" Narrator: WHAT COMES NEXT IS SHOCKING. THE MAN CONVICTED OF KILLING PRAVIN VARUGHESE WILL HAVE THAT CONVICTION THROWN OUT. Narrator: THE JUDGE SAYS THERE'S BEEN AN ERROR IN THE WORDING OF THE INDICTMENT, AND THE USE OF THE WORD "KNOWINGLY" MAY HAVE CONFUSED THE JURY. WE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THIS INDICTMENT AND SAID, "OH, MY GOSH. THIS KID NEVER HAD A CHANCE." THE PROSECUTORS NEVER COULD HAVE PROVEN SOMETHING CALLED "INTENTIONAL, KNOWING MURDER." Narrator: PRAVIN'S FAMILY IS ASTOUNDED. I HAVE READ SO MANY INDICTMENTS, AND THAT IS A WORD IN ALMOST ALL OF THE INDICTMENTS. "KNOWINGLY." THE JUDGE SAW IT. THE PROSECUTORS, THE DEFENSE -- NOBODY EVER OPPOSED IT. NOBODY EVER OBJECTED TO IT. Narrator: JUST WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE HE WOULD BE SENTENCED FOR MURDER, THE JUDGE ORDERS A NEW TRIAL, AND BETHUNE GOES FREE. WHAT IS GOING ON? WHAT'S GOING ON? Lovely: THE JUDGE LET HIM WALK FREE. THAT'S WHAT I'M DISGUSTED ABOUT. WE ALWAYS TRUSTED AUTHORITY, TRUSTED LAW ENFORCEMENT, BUT NOW I DON'T. Narrator: THE PROSECUTOR INTENDS TO PUSH FOR A NEW TRIAL, BUT FOR NOW, GAEGE REMAINS FREE. Liam: GAEGE IS AN INNOCENT MAN. HE DID NOTHING WRONG. Narrator: WILL WE EVER FIND OUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED? WILL THERE BE JUSTICE FOR PRAVIN? BOTH PRAVIN'S FAMILY AND MONICA ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THEIR SEARCH FOR THE TRUTH. THIS IS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO GET UP AND FIGHT. WE ARE NOT SPECIAL, WE ARE NOT DIFFERENT. WE ARE EVERY MOM IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ANYBODY COULD STAND UP TO INJUSTICE. Narrator: AND FOR LOVELY, THE MISSION TO GET ANSWERS IS DEEPLY PERSONAL. Lovely: WE DID NOT HAVE CHILDREN FOR FIVE YEARS AFTER WE GOT MARRIED. SO THE WHOLE TIME WE WERE PRAYING FOR A BABY, I PROMISED TO GOD, "IF YOU GIVE ME A CHILD, "I PROMISE YOU I'LL DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TAKE CARE OF THAT BABY AND DO EVERYTHING THAT I CAN." SO, WHEN I LOST PRAVIN, I THOUGHT OF THAT PROMISE. I HAD TO DO IT.
