 IT'S KNOWN FOR RAFTING AND FLY FISHING, NOT FOR LITTLE CHILDREN TO GO MISSING. WE JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS, AND THAT WAS HORRIFYING. Narrator: THE RUGGED TERRAIN IS UNLIKELY TO BLAME. Mark: FOR ANYBODY TO TELL ME THAT A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD COULDN'T NAVIGATE THE TERRAIN WAS ABSURD. Narrator: TWO DISTURBING CASES WITH MULTIPLE THEORIES. THE KILLER MAY BE IN THIS ROOM. I'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT UNTIL I'M NO LONGER ABLE TO. Narrator: WHAT REALLY HAPPENED TO ABBY, LIBBY, AND DYLAN? 14-YEAR-OLD LIBBY GERMAN AND 13-YEAR-OLD ABBY WILLIAMS ARE BEST FRIENDS.

 ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 13, 2017, LIBBY POSTS THIS PHOTO OF ABBY ON SNAPCHAT WHILE THEY'RE OUT HIKING. IT'S ACTUALLY A REALLY GOOD PICTURE. LIBBY DID A GOOD JOB. THAT'S THE LAST TIME I SAW THEM. Narrator: IT'S A MYSTERY THAT HAS ROCKED THE TOWN OF DELPHI, INDIANA, AND THE GIRLS' FAMILIES SINCE 2017. THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN TOWNS LIKE DELPHI. THIS HAPPENS IN THE CITY. THIS HAPPENS IN OTHER PLACES, BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE. Narrator: ABBY IS A KIND AND JOYFUL 13-YEAR-OLD WITH A PASSION FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. LOVED PEOPLE, LOVED PETS, LOVED ART, LOVED MUSIC. TRIED EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN AT LEAST ONCE. Narrator: 14-YEAR-OLD LIBBY IS ADVENTUROUS AND FULL OF LIFE. SHE LOVES SPORTS AND EXCELS AT MATH AND SCIENCE. LIBBY WAS A VERY INVESTIGATIVE PERSON. SHE ALWAYS HAD TO ASK QUESTIONS AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT SOMETHING. Narrator: THE TWO TEENS ARE EIGHTH GRADERS AT DELPHI COMMUNITY MIDDLE SCHOOL IN DELPHI, INDIANA. ON THE MORNING OF FEBRUARY 13th, THE BEST FRIENDS WAKE UP AT LIBBY'S GRANDPARENTS HOUSE AFTER A SLEEPOVER. LIBBY HAS LIVED WITH HER GRANDPARENTS SINCE SHE WAS 3 YEARS OLD. THEY'RE EXCITED ABOUT A RARE DAY OFF FROM SCHOOL. IT WAS UNSEASONABLY WARM THAT DAY, AND THEY LIKED TO BE OUTSIDE. SO THEY SAID, "HEY, LET'S GO OUT TO THE TRAILS AND WALK AROUND." DID WHAT I WOULD HOPED THEY WOULD DO... GO OUTSIDE. GO FIND SOMETHING TO DO. DON'T STARE AT A SCREEN ALL DAY. IT WAS KIND OF A SPUR OF THE MOMENT THAT THEY WANTED TO GO OUT TO THE TRAILS. Narrator: LIBBY'S OLDER SISTER, KELSI, DRIVES THE GIRLS TO A POPULAR HIKING PATH NOT FAR AWAY, DROPPING THEM OFF AROUND 1:30 P.M. THEY WERE NOT WEARING SWEATSHIRTS LIKE MY GRANDMA TOLD THEM TO, SO I MADE SURE THEY GOT THE SWEATSHIRTS THEY HAD PUT IN THE CAR, AND THEN I TOLD LIBBY I LOVED HER. Narrator: LIBBY'S DAD DERRICK, WHO ALSO LIVES WITH HER GRANDPARENTS, IS SET TO PICK THEM UP AT 3:00 P.M., SO THEY GIRLS HAVE ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF TO WALK THE TRAILS. GO OUT THERE, SPEND A COUPLE HOURS OUT THERE, TAKING PICTURES AND GOOFING OFF AND BEING KIDS. SO... [ SIGHS ] THAT WAS THEIR... THAT WAS THEIR GOAL. THEY WENT TO TAKE SOME PICTURES AND BE OUTDOORS. Narrator: AT 2:07 P.M., 32 MINUTES AFTER BEING DROPPED OFF, LIBBY POSTS THIS PICTURE ON SNAPCHAT OF ABBY CROSSING THE OLD RAILROAD BRIDGE. IT'S KIND OF NICE TO KNOW THAT AT LEAST IN THOSE... BEFORE, THEY HAD A PRETTY GOOD AFTERNOON. Narrator: JUST OVER AN HOUR LATER, AT 3:11 P.M., LIBBY'S DAD CALLS HER PHONE TO SAY HE'S ABOUT TO ARRIVE AT THE PICKUP POINT. THERE'S NO ANSWER, SO HE WALKS OUT ON THE TRAIL AND TRIES LIBBY AGAIN. WHEN HE STILL DOESN'T GET AN ANSWER, HE CALLS LIBBY'S GRANDMOTHER, BECKY, TO TELL HER THAT HE'S HAVING TROUBLE LOCATING THE GIRLS. SO BECKY CALLED ME, I THINK, JUST A LITTLE BIT BEFORE 4:00. I WAS AT WORK. I SAID, ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA HEAD THAT WAY, 'CAUSE THEY SAID THAT THEY'RE GONNA HEAD OUT TO THE TRAILS, AND START TO LOOK. Narrator: AT FIRST, THEY THINK THE GIRLS PROBABLY JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME, BUT THEY QUICKLY BECOME WORRIED. IT GOT TO BE, I DON'T KNOW, CLOSE TO 5:00 AT THIS TIME, AND THE WIFE SAYS, "HEY, I'M GONNA NEED TO CALL THE POLICE. IT'S GONNA BE GETTING DARK HERE 'FORE TOO LONG." Narrator: AT AROUND 5:30 P.M., MIKE DIALS THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. THEY WERE QUICK ON THE SCENE, COME OUT THERE, AND THEY WERE WALKING TRAILS WITH US. Narrator: ABBY'S MOM GETS A CALL AT WORK FROM LIBBY'S GRANDMOTHER. I COULD HEAR IN BECKY'S VOICE SHE WAS STRESSED. SHE WAS WORRIED. SOMETHING WAS UP. AND I WAS, LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY." I CALLED A FRIEND OF MINE. I WAS, LIKE, "HEY, CAN YOU HEAD OVER TO THE PARK "AND JUST HOLLER FOR EITHER ONE OF THOSE GIRLS? 'CAUSE THEY'RE IN BIG TROUBLE." Narrator: IT COULD JUST BE NOTHING. WE'RE JUST HOPING SOMEBODY GET A PHONE CALL AND SAY, "OH, HEY, YOU KNOW, WE GOT LOST, "AND FINALLY GOT, YOU KNOW, MY PHONE, WE GOT A SIGNAL," WHATEVER. Narrator: AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKELY THEY WOULD JUST TAKE OFF. Kelsi: LIBBY WASN'T REALLY ONE TO RUN AWAY. I KNOW HER PRETTY WELL. AND ABBY WAS THE SAME WAY. Narrator: OR MAYBE THEY'VE MADE SECRET PLANS. POLICE SCAN THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS. WERE THEY MEETING SOMEBODY THAT WASN'T WHO THEY SAID THEY WERE? WHEN WE DIDN'T FIND ANY OF THOSE THINGS, THEN IT WAS, LIKE, "WELL, NOW WHAT?" Narrator: IN THE SMALL TOWN OF DELPHI, WHICH HAS A POPULATION OF LESS THAN 3,000, WORD OF THE MISSING GIRLS SPREADS QUICKLY. SOCIAL MEDIA GOT AHOLD OF IT, AND PEOPLE POST OUT THERE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR 'EM, AND THE WHOLE TOWN KINDA CAME OUT. FLASHLIGHTS WERE ALL OVER THE PLACE AS IT GOT DARK. I WAS AMAZED BY THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY THAT WERE HELPING US LOOK FOR THE GIRLS. THEY WERE SENT OUT IN GROUPS WITH SOMEBODY EITHER FROM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT OR POLICE DEPARTMENT. Narrator: BUT THE LATER IT GETS, PANIC SETS IN. LIBBY HATES THE DARK. THAT WORRIED ME BECAUSE I KNEW THEN THE ODDS OF THEM BEING OUT, SCREWING AROUND WERE NOT PROBABLY... THAT WASN'T IT. EITHER THEY GOT LOST, MAYBE THEY HIKED OFF, YOU KNOW, THE COMMON TRAIL, THEY FELL DOWN A RAVINE, OR, YOU KNOW, FELL OFF THE BRIDGE JUST, YOU KNOW, COME TO MIND. Narrator: BY MIDNIGHT, THERE'S STILL NO SIGN OF THE GIRLS, BUT POLICE SUSPEND THEIR SEARCH UNTIL THE MORNING, SAYING THERE'S PROBABLY NO REASON TO WORRY. Anna: I REMEMBER THE OFFICER SAYING, "LOOK, LATE MOVIE GETS OUT IN, LIKE, A HALF-HOUR. "I MEAN, IF YOU'RE GONNA BE GROUNDED "FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE FOR TAKING OFF WITH SOME BOYS OR TAKING OFF WITH YOUR FRIENDS, YOU MIGHT AS WELL..." AND THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT COMING FROM THAT. Narrator: STILL, THE GIRLS' FAMILIES ARE FAR TOO ANXIOUS TO JUST SIT AND WAIT. LOCALS AND A LOT OF OUR FRIENDS SAID, "NO, WE'RE HERE ALL NIGHT LONG. LET'S GO BACK OUT." OUT THERE 'ROUND 2:00 IN THE MORNING MYSELF TO THE CANAL. IT WAS DARK AND IT WAS COLD AND USING FLASHLIGHTS. AND THEY KEPT SCANNING THE WATER AND THE GRASS. AND I WAS, LIKE, "NO, I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A BODY. "I'M NOT DOING THIS. I'M NOT. THOSE GIRLS ARE JUST REALLY GROUNDED." AND I MARCHED MYSELF RIGHT BACK TO THE TRUCK, AND I SAID, "I CANNOT DO THIS." Narrator: BY THE TIME LIBBY'S GRANDFATHER FINALLY GETS INTO HIS CAR, SOME TIME AFTER 3:00 A.M., HE KNOWS SOMETHING ISN'T ADDING UP. SHE WOULD HAVE WALKED... YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD HAVE WALKED IN TOWN AND CALLED. LIBBY WAS RESILIENT ENOUGH TO DO, YOU KNOW, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE JUST WAITED OUT THERE TILL SOMEBODY SHOWED UP. THAT JUST WASN'T HER. THE WHOLE THING WAS SUCH A WHIRLWIND. [ BLOWS AIR ] THAT WAS A LONG NIGHT. [ EXHALES SLOWLY ] Narrator: WHEREVER THE TEENS ARE, THEIR FAMILIES ARE CERTAIN THAT THE BEST FRIENDS ARE TOGETHER. THEY WERE SO CLOSE. NEITHER OF THEM WOULD HAVE LEFT THE OTHER ONE. Narrator: BY THE NEXT MORNING, THE SEARCH FOR ABBY AND LIBBY TAKES ON ADDED URGENCY. IT'S ORGANIZED AND WELL-COORDINATED. POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS, AND VOLUNTEERS ARE ALL HUNTING FOR THE GIRLS. YOU GOTTA REMAIN HOPEFUL. BUT EVERYBODY, I'M SURE, IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND HAD SOME FEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, IT HAD BEEN OVERNIGHT. AND AS THE HOURS WANED ON, YOU KNOW, THE WORRY GOT MORE. Narrator: AT AROUND NOON, KELSI IS OUT WITH A SMALL GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS WHO'VE BEEN SEARCHING UNDER THE RAILROAD BRIDGE WHEN SHE HEARS SOMEONE YELL OUT. WE HEARD SOMEBODY YELL A QUESTION ABOUT SOMETHING THAT THE GIRLS WERE WEARING. THEY HAD FOUND ONE OF THE SHOES. Narrator: FOR A MOMENT, IT FEELS LIKE A SIGN OF HOPE. BUT WITHIN MINUTES, THERE'S ANOTHER DISCOVERY. ABBY'S MOTHER IS IN TOWN AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WHEN HER FORMER PASTOR APPROACHES. HE SAYS, "HAS ANYBODY TALKED TO YOU OR ANYTHING?" AND I SAID, "NO." HE GOES, "OKAY, WE NEED YOU TO COME UPSTAIRS." HE TOLD ME THAT THE GIRLS HAD BEEN FOUND AND THAT THEY WERE DECEASED. # THE FIRST THING I REMEMBER... SAYING AFTER HE TOLD ME THAT, I SAID, "SHE DIDN'T GET BAPTIZED." HE PUT HIS HANDS ON HIS SHOULDERS AND HE SAID, "YOUR DAUGHTER GAVE HER HEART TO THE LORD, AND I PROMISE YOU, SHE IS WITH HIM TODAY." # [ Voice breaks ] AND IMMEDIATELY, AS BAD AS EVERYTHING WAS, IT WAS BETTER. Narrator: THE GIRLS' BODIES ARE DISCOVERED LESS THAN A MILE FROM WHERE THEY BEGAN THEIR HIKE 24 HOURS EARLIER. AND IN THIS TIGHT-KNIT TOWN, THIS FEELS PERSONAL. WHY LIBBY? WHY ABBY? AS THE LEADER OF THE INDIANA STATE POLICE, I SAY, "I AM SO VERY SORRY." Narrator: CHILLING CLUES ARE ABOUT TO PAINT A TERRIFYING PICTURE OF THE GIRLS' LAST MOMENTS ALIVE. THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING, NOT TODAY'S WORLD. WHO DOES SOMETHING LIKE THIS? Narrator: BEST FRIENDS ABBY WILLIAMS AND LIBBY GERMAN GO FOR A HIKE ON A BEAUTIFUL FEBRUARY AFTERNOON AND NEVER COME BACK. THEY'RE FOUND MURDERED. AUTOPSIES ARE CONDUCTED AND DNA IS COLLECTED, BUT THE POLICE RELEASE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION. THEY DIDN'T SHARE WITH US A WHOLE LOT, INCLUDING THEIR INJURIES OR ANY OF THAT FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CASE. I LET THE DETECTIVES DO THEIR JOB, AND I DON'T... I DON'T LIKE THINKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED OUT THERE. Narrator: INSTANTLY, THE TRAGEDY MAKES NATIONAL NEWS... THEY'RE STILL PROCESSING THE CRIME SCENE. ...AND MEDIA FLOODS INTO DELPHI. THEN ON FEBRUARY 15th, ONE DAY AFTER THE GIRLS' BODIES ARE FOUND, POLICE RELEASE THEIR FIRST PIECE OF INFORMATION... A GRAINY PHOTO OF AN UNIDENTIFIED MAN WALKING ON THE BRIDGE. THE IMAGE WAS CAPTURED BY LIBBY ON HER CELLPHONE. I BELIEVED THAT SHE JUST SENSED SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT. WHAT WAS THIS GUY DOING, YOU KNOW, OUT THERE, COMING TOWARDS THEM? Narrator: WHO IS THE STRANGE MAN? THE IMAGE IS TAKEN FROM THE FAR END OF THE RAILROAD BRIDGE, AND THE MAN IS ABOUT 40 FEET AWAY. THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO THE SPOT WHERE LIBBY'S DAD WAS SUPPOSED TO PICK THEM UP IS TO CROSS THE NARROW BRIDGE, SO THERE'S NO WAY TO AVOID THIS MAN. THEY COULDN'T PASS EACH OTHER. THEY WERE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIM TO COME TO THE SIDE BEFORE THEY COULD GO. AND I DON'T BELIEVE THERE IS ANY RUNNING WHEN IT COMES TO A BRIDGE LIKE THAT. Narrator: THEN, A WEEK LATER, POLICE REVEAL ANOTHER TROUBLING CLUE. IT'S AN EERIE, MUFFLED AUDIO RECORDING OF A MAN'S VOICE DELIVERING A 3-WORD COMMAND. COULD IT BE THE VOICE OF THE SAME MAN WHO IS IN LIBBY'S PHOTO? WHAT DOES IT MEAN? GOING "DOWN THE HILL" WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE TEENS AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE AND TOWARDS THE CREEK, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE THEIR BODIES WERE FOUND. FOR THEIR FAMILIES, THE HAUNTING AUDIO AND THE HAUNTING PHOTO ARE TORMENTING. GOD, I HOPE WE KNOW WHO THIS IS. ON THE OTHER HAND, I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW. I DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS WOULD BE SOMEBODY THAT WE KNEW. THAT'S A TERRIFYING THOUGHT. Narrator: THE PHOTO AND RECORDING ARE CRUCIAL EVIDENCE CAPTURED BY A QUICK-THINKING AND EXTREMELY BRAVE 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS THAT THAT YOUNG LADY IS A HERO. Anna: WHAT SHE DID IS MIRACULOUS BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT WE EVEN KNEW... I MEAN, OUTSIDE OF FINDING THEM DECEASED... THAT THERE WAS SOMEBODY OUT THERE OR WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE LOOKED LIKE. Narrator: BUT THE IDENTITY OF THE STRANGE MAN REMAINS A MYSTERY. AND AFTER A MONTH GOES BY, LIBBY'S HEARTBROKEN GRANDFATHER SPEAKS PUBLICLY FOR THE FIRST TIME. I IMAGINE THERE WAS PROBABLY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ONE OR BOTH TO SEPARATE AND TRY TO MAKE A BREAK DIFFERENT WAYS. THOSE GIRLS LOVED EACH OTHER. THEY WERE GOOD FRIENDS. NEITHER ONE OF THEM LEFT EACH OTHER'S SIDE. BOTH THOSE GIRLS ARE HEROES IN MY BOOK. Narrator: HE PLEADS FOR ANYONE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING TO COME FORWARD. Mike: WE REALLY NEED THE HELP. ONE SMALL TIP, YOU KNOW, AS INSIGNIFICANT AS IT MAY SEEM, MAY BE THE ONE THAT THEY NEED TO TIE THIS THING UP AND GET IT DONE. Narrator: LOCAL, STATE, AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS SET UP A COMMAND CENTER IN DELPHI. THEY ARE DESPERATE TO FIND THE MYSTERY MAN, AND THEY ALERT THE PUBLIC WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR. DID THIS INDIVIDUAL TRAVEL UNEXPECTEDLY? DID THEY CHANGE THEIR APPEARANCE? DID THEY SHAVE THEIR BEARD, CUT THEIR HAIR? Narrator: POLICE CONFIRMED THAT LIBBY MANAGED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL AUDIO AND VIDEO, BUT THEY DON'T RELEASE IT TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT CONTAINS INFORMATION THAT WOULD ONLY BE KNOWN TO THEIR KILLER. ABBY'S MOTHER IS ALLOWED TO SEE SOME OF THEM, BUT SAYS THEY DON'T REVEAL MUCH. LIBBY SAYS SOMETHING, LIKE, "WELL, THE PATH ENDS HERE, SO WE CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER." YOU'RE JUST KIND OF GOING BY, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEIR... WHAT THEIR ACTUAL FEELINGS ARE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY HEAR ANYTHING OR SEE ANYTHING. Narrator: A $200,000 REWARD IS OFFERED, BUT MONTHS PASS WITH NO LEADS. THEN, FIVE MONTHS AFTER ABBY AND LIBBY ARE MURDERED, POLICE RELEASE THIS SKETCH. IT'S BASED ON ACCOUNTS FROM OTHER WITNESSES WHO SAW THE MAN LIBBY PHOTOGRAPHED ON THE TRAIL THAT DAY. THE POLICE THOUGHT, WITHIN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS WITH THE SKETCH AND THE PICTURE, THIS WAS GONNA BE A DONE DEAL. THIS WAS NOT GONNA TAKE LONG AFTER THAT, THAT THIS WHOLE THING WAS GONNA UNFOLD FAST, AND IT DIDN'T. THE ENTIRE TOWN OF DELPHI IS DEVASTATED AND WANTS ANSWERS. SOMEBODY TOOK OUR GIRLS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN, AND MURDERED 'EM, AND IT WAS PART OF THIS COMMUNITY'S FAMILY AS WELL. WE'VE BEEN... WE'VE BEEN, YOU KNOW, VIOLATED. IT'S MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE ANGRY, A LOT OF PEOPLE MAD A LITTLE. WE WANT TO CATCH THIS GUY. Narrator: TWO MONTHS LATER, IN SEPTEMBER 2017, INVESTIGATORS SEEM TO CATCH THEIR FIRST BREAK. INDIANA STATE POLICE ARE LOOKING INTO A POSSIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN AN INDIANA MAN ARRESTED IN COLORADO AND THE MURDERS OF ABBY WILLIAMS AND LIBBY GERMAN IN DELPHI SEVEN MONTHS AGO. Narrator: THE MAN IS ARRESTED AFTER THREATENING PEOPLE WITH A HATCHET NEAR A HIKING TRAIL. HIS MUG SHOT GEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE SKETCH THE POLICE RELEASED, AND HE HAS FAILED TO REGISTER IN INDIANA AS A SEX OFFENDER. I TELL MY MOM, "SO THEY THINK THEY HAVE A GUY." AND SHE BOLTS. I WAS, LIKE, "CALM DOWN. NOW WE HAVE TO WAIT." Narrator: THERE ARE ENOUGH SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE CASES THAT THE INDIANA POLICE CONSIDER THE MAN TO BE A PERSON OF INTEREST. THEY TRAVEL TO COLORADO TO TALK TO HIM. IT'S THE FIRST REAL GLIMMER OF HOPE ABBY AND LIBBY'S FAMILIES HAVE. I WANT JUSTICE FOR THE GIRLS. I WANT... I WANT JUSTICE FOR OUR FAMILY AND OUR COMMUNITY. AND I REALLY WANT THIS GUY CAUGHT BEFORE HE DOES IT TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAMILY. Narrator: BUT DO THE POLICE HAVE THE RIGHT PERSON? Narrator: SEVEN MONTHS AFTER 13-YEAR-OLD ABBY WILLIAMS AND HER BEST FRIEND, 14-YEAR-OLD LIBBY GERMAN, ARE FOUND MURDERED ON A HIKING TRAIL, INDIANA AUTHORITIES THINK THEY FINALLY HAVE A SOLID LEAD. Man: INVESTIGATORS FROM INDIANA ARE MORE THAN 1,000 MILES AWAY TONIGHT, TALKING TO THIS MAN. YOU CAN PUT THE PICTURE AND LOOK AT IT AND SAY, "OKAY, THAT DEFINITELY COULD BE THE GUY." Narrator: BUT THAT HOPE IS QUICKLY CRUSHED. Man: WE WENT OUT TO COLORADO AND WE SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME WITH HIM, AND HE'S NOT A PERSON THAT WE CARE A WHOLE LOT ABOUT AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. THAT ENDED UP BEING THE FIRST ON THIS ROLLER COASTER RIDE OF SOMEBODY'S MENTIONED, AND EVERYBODY CALLS, AND EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW, AND THEN NOPE. SO YOU JUST TRY TO STAY RIGHT ABOUT LEVEL. Narrator: ONE YEAR GOES BY AND THE POLICE ARE STILL STUMPED. THEN IN JANUARY 2019, THE CASE HEATS UP AGAIN. ANOTHER SEX OFFENDER IS ARRESTED IN A TOWN 100 MILES FROM WHERE THE GIRLS' BODIES WERE FOUND. Woman: NOW INVESTIGATORS SAY THEY'RE LOOKING INTO THIS MAN. Narrator: THE NEWS SPREADS LIKE WILDFIRE. Man: LOOK, HIS POLICE MUG SHOT BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THIS FBI SKETCH OF THE KILLER. Narrator: BIZARRELY, THIS MAN'S SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS ARE FULL OF POSTS RELATING TO SEX CRIMES AND MISSING CHILDREN, INCLUDING THE MURDERS OF ABBY AND LIBBY. HE HAS EVEN POSTED THE SKETCH THE POLICE CIRCULATED OF THEIR POSSIBLE KILLER WITH THE TAG LINE "PASS IT AROUND. COULD BE ANYWHERE." BUT THREE MONTHS LATER, POLICE ANNOUNCE THAT THEIR INVESTIGATION IS HEADED IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THEY HAVE NEW INFORMATION ABOUT THE KILLER. WE BELIEVE THIS PERSON IS CURRENTLY BETWEEN THE AGE RANGE OF 18 AND 40. WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS PERSON IS FROM DELPHI. Narrator: THEY RELEASE A NEW SKETCH, ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL PORTIONS OF THE AUDIO AND VIDEO CAPTURED ON LIBBY'S PHONE. AFTER 26 MONTHS OF TIRELESS INVESTIGATING, WITH MORE THAN 1,000 INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED AND 40,000 TIPS LOOKED INTO, THE POLICE SUPERINTENDENT CAN'T HIDE HIS ANGER AS HE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO THE KILLER. TO THE MURDERER, WHO MAY BE IN THIS ROOM, WHAT WILL THOSE CLOSEST TO YOU THINK OF WHEN THEY FIND OUT THAT YOU BRUTALLY MURDERED TWO LITTLE GIRLS? GOSH, I'LL NEVER FORGET IT. Anna: IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS, BUT THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR THE GUY THAT KILLED OUR GIRLS. I CAN BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. Narrator: FOR KELSI, LOSING HER LITTLE SISTER IS HARD TO ACCEPT. I WOULD COME UP THE DRIVEWAY AND STILL CHECK HER ROOM... [ Voice breaks ] TO SEE IF HER LIGHT WAS ON. UM... I JUST DIDN'T WANT HER TO BE GONE. [ Crying ] Narrator: FOR ABBY'S MOTHER, EMOTIONS REMAIN RAW. [ Voice breaks ] IT'S NOT EVEN SO MUCH ABOUT... WHAT I'M MISSING RIGHT NOW. IT'S WHAT I'M GONNA MISS THE REST OF HER LIFE. Narrator: THE AGONY IS THE SAME FOR BOTH FAMILIES. ABBY AND LIBBY WERE MURDERED. THE KILLER IS STILL OUT THERE, AND THEY WANT JUSTICE. I'LL CONTINUE TO FIGHT UNTIL I'M NO LONGER ABLE TO, WHICH MEANS I'M NO LONGER ON THIS EARTH. MY MOTHER SAID IT BEST. IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE OPEN-HEART SURGERY, BUT THERE WILL BE NO ANESTHETIC. WE CAN'T FIX THIS, AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO LIVE THIS WAY THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE. Narrator: WILL WE EVER KNOW WHO KILLED ABBY AND LIBBY? # IN COLORADO, THE MYSTERY OF WHAT HAPPENED TO A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY HAS BEEN HAUNTING HIS FAMILY SINCE 2012. DYLAN REDWINE'S STORY BEGINS DYLAN REDWINE'S STORY BEGINS ON SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 18th, WHEN HIS MOM DRIVES HIM TO THE COLORADO SPRINGS AIRPORT. HE'S GOING TO VISIT HIS DAD. I SAID, "OH, YOU'RE NOT TOO BIG TO GIVE YOUR MOM A HUG." AND SO HE GAVE ME A HUG, AND... [ INHALES SHARPLY ] I TOLD HIM I LOVED HIM. Narrator: DYLAN'S DAD LIVES IN VALLECITO, A SMALL TOWN NESTLED IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, JUST OUTSIDE DURANGO. HIS MOM HAS RECENTLY BEEN AWARDED FULL CUSTODY OF DYLAN, BUT HIS DAD RETAINS VISITATION RIGHTS. Mark: DYLAN WAS, IN MANY WAYS, MY BEST FRIEND FROM THE TIME THAT HE WAS BORN. YOU KNOW, I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS A BABY. HE WAS A JOY TO BE AROUND. HE WAS ALWAYS HAPPY. Narrator: DYLAN'S DAD PICKS HIM UP JUST BEFORE 6:00 P.M. SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS CAPTURE THIS IMAGE OF HIM SHORTLY AFTER HE LANDS, AND THIS ONE AT 7:05 P.M. AT A WALMART, WHERE THEY STOP ON THE WAY HOME. THAT NIGHT, THEY GRAB DINNER AND WATCH A MOVIE. THERE WAS NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY ABOUT THAT NIGHT. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, DYLAN HAS PLANS TO MEET UP WITH A FRIEND. MARK GETS UP AT AROUND 7:00 A.M. AND TRIES TO WAKE HIM. I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GONNA GET UP WITH ME WHEN I LEFT TO GO INTO TOWN THAT MORNING, BUT HE WASN'T HAVING NO PART OF THAT. SO WHEN I LEFT THE HOUSE, HE WAS STILL ON THE COUCH, SLEEPING. Narrator: AFTER RUNNING SOME ERRANDS, MARK RETURNS HOME AROUND FOUR HOURS LATER, AROUND 11:30 A.M. HE FINDS THE DOOR OPEN, THE TV ON, AND A CEREAL BOWL ON THE TABLE. SO I'M THINKING, WELL, GREAT, HE'S UP. HE'S EATING BREAKFAST. Narrator: THERE'S NO SIGN OF DYLAN, BUT MARK THINKS NOTHING OF IT. I JUST ASSUMED THAT HE WAS OFF WITH ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AND HAD LOST TRACK OF TIME AND WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION. IT'S NOT LIKE HE WORE A WATCH. Elaine: WHEN HE WOULD GO VISIT HIS DAD, HE REALLY ENJOYED THAT TIME TO SPEND WITH HIS FRIENDS, AND HE DID SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM. IT WASN'T UNTIL A FEW HOURS HAD PASSED, AND HE HADN'T POKED HIS HEAD IN THE DOOR TO SAY HI OR ANYTHING THAT, YOU KNOW, I STARTED TO BECOME CONCERNED. Narrator: MARK JUMPS INTO HIS CAR AND STARTS KNOCKING ON THE DOORS OF DYLAN'S FRIENDS. THEY IMMEDIATELY SAID, "NO, WE HAVEN'T SEEN DYLAN ALL DAY AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM." Narrator: NOW MARK IS ALARMED. IT'S BEEN MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS SINCE HE'S SEEN DYLAN, AND NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHERE HE IS. HIS BACKPACK AND CELLPHONE ARE GONE AND HE'S NOT RESPONDING TO CALLS. Elaine: MARK HAD CONTACTED ME VIA TEXT AT ABOUT 5:00 IN THE AFTERNOON, ASKING ME IF I'D HEARD FROM DYLAN, BECAUSE DYLAN WAS MISSING. THAT WAS HORRIFYING. Narrator: JUST WHERE COULD DYLAN BE? Narrator: AFTER MAKING THE TRIP OUT TO VISIT HIS DAD IN COLORADO, 13-YEAR-OLD DYLAN REDWINE HAS VANISHED. LATE ON THE AFTERNOON OF MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19th, HIS DAD REPORTS HIS SON MISSING. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO COMPREHEND WHAT WAS GOING ON. I MEAN, I THINK I WAS IN A STATE OF SHOCK OF SOME KIND. Narrator: MARK ALSO TEXTS DYLAN'S MOM, WHO LIVES 300 MILES AWAY. SHE HASN'T HEARD FROM DYLAN SINCE SUNDAY NIGHT. SHE IMMEDIATELY TELLS HIS OLDER BROTHER THAT SHE HAS A BAD FEELING. Cory: AT FIRST, I DIDN'T TAKE HER SERIOUSLY. AND SHE WAS, LIKE, "WELL, I'M GOING DOWN TO DURANGO." SOON AS SHE SAID THAT, I KNEW IT WAS A LOT MORE SERIOUS. Narrator: ON MONDAY NIGHT, DYLAN'S MOTHER AND BROTHER MAKE THE 6-HOUR DRIVE FROM COLORADO SPRINGS TO DURANGO AND GO STRAIGHT TO THE POLICE STATION. ALL YOU HAVE IS HOPE. YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE. Narrator: NOBODY KNOWS WHERE DYLAN IS. THE LAST TIME HE USES HIS PHONE IS AT 9:37 SUNDAY NIGHT. HE MAKES PLANS TO MEET A FRIEND BRIGHT AND EARLY AT 6:30 MONDAY MORNING. BUT DYLAN DOESN'T SHOW UP, AND AT 6:46 A.M., HIS FRIEND SENDS A TEXT SAYING, "WHERE ARE YOU?" DYLAN NEVER RESPONDS, AND NOW HE ISN'T REPLYING TO HIS FAMILY EITHER, WHICH ISN'T LIKE HIM. HE JUST CARED DEEPLY FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS. HE DIDN'T WANT TO HURT ANYBODY. Narrator: AT FIRST, POLICE SUSPECT DYLAN RAN AWAY. THEY WERE HOPING THAT HE WAS JUST HIDING AWAY IN A HOUSE OF A FRIEND. Narrator: THE THEORY MAKES SENSE BECAUSE AFTER HIS PARENTS' BITTER DIVORCE, TENSIONS ARE HIGH, AND DYLAN WASN'T THRILLED ABOUT SPENDING THANKSGIVING WITH HIS DAD. "DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH FUN," KIND OF SAYING IT SARCASTICALLY. AND HE LOOKS AT ME AND GOES, "OH, I NEVER DO." Narrator: BUT ELAINE IS WORRIED. SHE SAYS DYLAN WOULD NEVER RUN OFF WITHOUT CONTACTING HER. HE WOULD HAVE CALLED ME WITHIN THE FIRST TWO HOURS IF HE DID. Narrator: BY THE TIME DYLAN'S MOM ARRIVES IN DURANGO, A DESPERATE HUNT TO FIND DYLAN IS UNDERWAY. SEARCH AND RESCUE TEAMS COMB THE AREA NEAR HIS DAD'S HOUSE, LOOKING FOR ANY SIGN OF THE 13-YEAR-OLD. THEY HAD CANINES. THEY HAD SEARCH CREWS. THEY HAD ATVs, MOBILE COMMAND CENTERS ON THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, MAPS. THEY WERE USING DRONES. Narrator: IT QUICKLY TURNS INTO ONE OF THE LARGEST SEARCHES ANYONE IN THE AREA HAS EVER SEEN. THE CASE OF DYLAN REDWINE, A 13-YEAR-OLD BOY WHO VANISHED. THERE WASN'T AN ABANDONED SHED, A CREEK, A CULVERT. THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT WE HADN'T LOOKED THROUGH. WE WENT SO FAR AS, YOU KNOW, BRINGING IN PSYCHICS. Narrator: COULD DYLAN JUST HAVE WANDERED OFF SOMEWHERE AND THEN GOT LOST OR DISORIENTED? Elaine: YOU JUST KEEP PLUGGING AWAY DAY AFTER DAY AND HOPING LIKE HELL YOU WILL FIND HIM. IT'S MY LITTLE BROTHER. IF ANYBODY COULD MAKE IT OUT, IT'D BE HIM. Narrator: THERE'S GOOD REASON TO STAY POSITIVE. A LOCAL LETTER CARRIER THINKS SHE SAW DYLAN THE AFTERNOON HE DISAPPEARED, WALKING DOWN A ROAD NEAR HIS DAD'S HOUSE. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR ANYONE TO SUSPECT THAT SOMETHING AWFUL HAD HAPPENED TO DYLAN. Narrator: BUT FOUR DAYS LATER, THINGS TAKE AN OMINOUS TURN. DOGS PICK UP THE SCENT OF HUMAN REMAINS IN VALLECITO LAKE, WHICH IS ABOUT 20 MILES FROM MARK'S HOUSE. DIVE TEAMS ARE SENT IN, BUT THERE'S NO TRACE OF DYLAN. IT WAS TRULY A MYSTERY. All: WHERE IS DYLAN? WHERE IS DYLAN? Narrator: FOR DYLAN'S FAMILY, IT'S THEIR WORST NIGHTMARE, BUT THEY REFUSE TO LOSE FAITH. NOT ONE DAY DID I EVER QUESTION OR DOUBT THAT DYLAN WAS ALIVE. YOU NEVER WANT TO THINK ABOUT YOUR CHILD GOING MISSING. AND THEN AFTER THAT, YOU NEVER WANT TO THINK ABOUT THEM NEVER COMING BACK. Narrator: IN THE TIGHT-KNIT COMMUNITY IN VALLECITO, NO ONE CAN BELIEVE SUCH A HORRIFYING EVENT IS PLAYING OUT IN THEIR MOUNTAIN PARADISE. Matt: THESE THINGS DON'T HAPPEN IN RURAL SOUTHWESTERN COLORADO. IT'S KNOWN FOR RAFTING AND FLY FISHING, NOT FOR LITTLE CHILDREN TO GO MISSING WITHOUT ANY IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM. Narrator: THERE ARE PLENTY OF THEORIES. WAS DYLAN INVOLVED IN A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT? WHAT IF HE WAS ABDUCTED? THIS WAS NOT JUST ONE OR TWO INVESTIGATORS. THIS WAS AN ENTIRE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT, THE STATE CRIME LAB, ALL OF THOSE ENTITIES WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND ANSWERS. Narrator: HUNDREDS OF VOLUNTEERS JOIN THE SEARCH, BUT A WEEK INTO IT, THE STRESS BEGINS TO WEAR ON DYLAN'S FAMILY. ELAINE AND CORY ACCUSE HIS FATHER OF NOT DOING ENOUGH TO HELP FIND HIM. HE ISN'T GETTING OUT AND LOOKING. HE'S JUST PLAYING IT COOL. MARK WAS SITTING IN HIS LA-Z-BOY RECLINER, WATCHING TV. HE DID NOTHING. Narrator: BUT IN THIS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH INVESTIGATION DISCOVERY, MARK SAYS HE WANTS DYLAN HOME AS MUCH AS EVERYONE ELSE DOES. Mark: AS A PARENT, CAN YOU EVER DO ENOUGH TO FIND A MISSING CHILD? AND UNTIL THAT CHILD IS FOUND, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS DONE ENOUGH. Narrator: THEN NINE DAYS AFTER DYLAN GOES MISSING, INVESTIGATORS MAKE A SOBERING ANNOUNCEMENT. GIVE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT HAS PASSED, THEY RULE OUT ONE THEORY. INVESTIGATORS NO LONGER BELIEVE DYLAN REDWINE IS A RUNAWAY. Narrator: AND THEN POLICE OBTAIN A SEARCH WARRANT FOR MARK REDWINE'S HOUSE. THEY SAY DYLAN'S FATHER IS NOT A SUSPECT AND CALL THE SEARCH STANDARD PROCEDURE, BUT HE'S TAKEN IN FOR QUESTIONING. I BELIEVE THEY THOUGHT THAT I WAS INVOLVED WITH KIDNAPPING MY SON. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS TAKE PART OF AN AREA RUG FROM MARK'S LIVING ROOM FOR PROCESSING, AND THEY SEIZE HIS TRUCK. LAW ENFORCEMENT DIDN'T HAVE TO WAIT 10 DAYS TO SEARCH MY HOUSE. I WOULD HAVE GLADLY ALLOWED THEM TO SEARCH MY HOUSE WITHOUT THE SEARCH WARRANT. MEANWHILE, THE SEARCH FOR DYLAN CONTINUES, BUT THE TERRAIN SURROUNDING HIS DAD'S HOUSE IS DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE SLOPES OF A 10,000-FOOT PEAK CALLED MIDDLE MOUNTAIN, WHICH IS ABOUT A MILE AWAY. IT'S RUGGED, ROCKY, AND REMOTE. Matt: NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK IS WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS MOUNTAIN. YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE HOW MANY HOURS THEY WERE OUT THERE LOOKING, TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING IN AN ENVIRONMENT LIKE THAT. Narrator: WITH NO SIGN OF DYLAN ANYWHERE, POLICE ARE STUMPED. AND TWO WEEKS AFTER HE DISAPPEARS, THEY BRING HIS PARENTS IN FOR POLYGRAPH TESTS. I PASSED WITH FLYING COLORS. ALL I HAVE IS LAW ENFORCEMENT'S WORD THAT I FAILED IT MISERABLY. Narrator: COULD DYLAN'S DAD BE HIDING SOMETHING? EVEN THOUGH THE COURT DOESN'T PUT A LOT OF WEIGHT BEHIND POLYGRAPHS... YOU CAN'T USE THOSE IN COURT... INVESTIGATORS DO. THAT HELPS THEM FOCUS THEIR ENERGY TOWARDS THE PERSON THEY BELIEVE TO BE DECEPTIVE. Narrator: DOES DYLAN'S FATHER KNOW MORE THAN HE IS REVEALING? OR ARE POLICE LOOKING IN THE WRONG PLACE? Narrator: 13-YEAR-OLD DYLAN REDWINE DISAPPEARS WITHOUT A TRACE. AND AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE HUNT FOR THE TEEN TURNS UP NOTHING, AND HIS DAD MARK FAILS A POLYGRAPH TEST, RUMORS QUICKLY CIRCULATE. THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT SAID BECAUSE MARK WAS THE LAST PERSON KNOWN TO SEE DYLAN, HE MUST HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS, WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED. PRETTY MUCH WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK OF DYLAN WENT MISSING, I THOUGHT MARK HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT. Narrator: THEN DYLAN'S MOTHER MAKES AN ALARMING CLAIM ABOUT HER EX-HUSBAND. A FEW MONTHS BEFORE DYLAN DISAPPEARED, SHE SAYS HE FOUND DISTURBING PHOTOS ON HIS DAD'S CAMERA. THEY SHOW MARK WEARING WOMEN'S CLOTHING WITH A SOILED DIAPER IN HIS MOUTH. WHEN DYLAN FOUND THOSE, IT DEVASTATED DYLAN. Narrator: DYLAN'S OLDER BROTHER CORY SAYS HE WAS WITH HIM WHEN HE DISCOVERED THE GRAPHIC PHOTOS. DYLAN'S SITTING ON THE BED, AND HE'S LIKE, "CORY, CORY, LOOK AT THESE PICTURES." AND IT HORRIFIED ME AND DYLAN. Narrator: MARK CALLS THE PHOTOS FAKES AND DENIES THAT IT'S HIM, THEN ACCUSES HIS EX-WIFE OF FABRICATING THEM TO HUMILIATE HIM. THE IMAGES THAT I HAVE SEEN HAVE BEEN PHOTOSHOPPED. NO, IT'S NOT ME IN THE PHOTOS. ABSOLUTELY NOT. Narrator: FOUR MONTHS AFTER DYLAN'S DISAPPEARANCE, IN FEBRUARY 2013, HIS FEUDING PARENTS ATTEMPT TO PUT ASIDE THEIR DIFFERENCES TO APPEAR TOGETHER ON A TALK SHOW. BUT IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG BEFORE THEY TURN ON EACH OTHER. DID YOU HURT HIM? NO, ELAINE, I WOULDN'T HURT HIM. WHAT WAS A PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD MISSING PERSONS CASE THEN TURNED INTO A MADE-FOR-TV MOVIE... [ SNAPS FINGERS ] IN AN INSTANT. HOW DO YOU FIND THE TRUTH IN TWO PEOPLE WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT POINTS, ONE PLACING BLAME ON THE OTHER FOR THE DEATH OF A CHILD? Narrator: IN JUNE OF 2013, WHEN THE LONG, COLORADO WINTER IS FINALLY OVER, INVESTIGATORS RESUME THEIR SEARCH FOR DYLAN ON MIDDLE MOUNTAIN. Elaine: THE MINUTE THE MOUNTAIN OPENED, THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE BIG SEARCH STARTED, IS UP ON THAT MOUNTAIN. Narrator: FIVE DAYS INTO THE SEARCH, THERE IS A TRIM DISCOVERY. A 6-MONTH-LONG SEARCH HAS ENDED IN THE WORST POSSIBLE WAY. Narrator: HUMAN REMAINS ARE FOUND JUST OFF THE MAIN ROAD THAT WINDS UP MIDDLE MOUNTAIN... SOME BONE FRAGMENTS AND PART OF A SHIRT AND A SOCK. THE LOCATION IS ABOUT AN 8-MILE DRIVE FROM DYLAN'S DAD'S HOUSE, AND DNA TESTS CONFIRM HIS FAMILY'S WORST FEAR. THE REMAINS BELONGED TO DYLAN. I LOST A PIECE OF MYSELF. I WAS ANGRY. I WAS CONFUSED. I WAS UPSET. MY HEART BROKE. I POUNDED MY FIST ON THE DESK AND I SCREAMED AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS AT 'EM. AND I STILL HAVE A HARD TIME WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND IT. Narrator: IT'S A DEVASTATING DISCOVERY, BUT IT MEANS INVESTIGATORS NOW HAVE SOMETHING TO WORK WITH. THAT WAS A TURNING POINT. NOW WE HAVE HUMAN REMAINS. EITHER HE WAS MURDERED, OR, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING ELSE HAS HAPPENED HERE. AS HARD AS IT IS TO COME TO THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND, WE STILL FOUND HIM. Narrator: IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW DYLAN DIED. BEARS AND MOUNTAIN LIONS ROAM THE WILDERNESS HERE. IS IT POSSIBLE THERE WAS SOME KIND OF TRAGIC ENCOUNTER WITH A DANGEROUS ANIMAL? INVESTIGATORS DON'T REVEAL ANY THEORIES, BUT THEY DO CONDUCT ANOTHER SEARCH OF MARK REDWINE'S HOUSE. THEN, IN AUGUST OF 2015, TWO LONG YEARS AFTER DYLAN'S REMAINS ARE FOUND, THEY MAKE A SHOCKING ANNOUNCEMENT. INVESTIGATORS SAYING THE 13-YEAR-OLD WAS MURDERED. Narrator: IT'S CRUSHING NEWS FOR DYLAN'S FAMILY. WE WERE NOT GONNA STOP UNTIL WE FOUND THE SICK BASTARD THAT DID THAT TO MY LITTLE BROTHER. Narrator: BUT THERE'S A TWIST. ON THE SAME DAY POLICE ANNOUNCE DYLAN WAS MURDERED, THEY ALSO IDENTIFY A PERSON OF INTEREST... DYLAN'S FATHER. POLICE SAY HIS BEHAVIOR AND INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS RAISE RED FLAGS. WHAT EXACTLY IS A PERSON OF INTEREST? NOBODY CAN GIVE ME THAT ANSWER. BUT DYLAN'S MOTHER SAYS SHE WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF HER EX-HUSBAND IS LYING. EVERY TIME I PIECE EVERYTHING TOGETHER, IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO MARK. ALWAYS. Narrator: THEN COMES ANOTHER SHOCKING REVEAL. IN ADDITION TO DYLAN'S MOM, MARK HAS ANOTHER EX-WIFE WHO HE ALSO HAD CHILDREN WITH. SHE SAYS THAT DURING THEIR DIVORCE, MARK TOLD HER HE WOULD KILL THEIR KIDS BEFORE HE LET HER HAVE THEM. AND DYLAN'S MOM ADDS THAT MARK USED TO MAKE STRANGE COMMENTS ABOUT DISPOSING OF BODIES. HE USED TO SAY, WHEN WE LIVED IN NORTH CAROLINA... AND NORTH CAROLINA'S A VERY GREEN, WOODY AREA... "IF I EVER KILLED ANYBODY, I WOULD NEVER LET ANYBODY KNOW, "AND I WOULD DUMP 'EM HERE, BECAUSE NO ONE WOULD EVER FIND THE BODY HERE." DYLAN'S OLDER BROTHER CORY ALSO CLAIMS THAT HIS FATHER IS CAPABLE OF BOTH ABUSE AND VIOLENCE. HE USED FEAR, AND THEN AS SOON AS YOU BACKTALKED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT'D BE VIOLENCE. BUT MARK FORCEFULLY DENIES THE ACCUSATIONS. I'VE NEVER BEEN ABUSIVE OR VIOLENT TO ANYBODY. Narrator: HE INSISTS HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIS SON'S DEATH. I DID NOT MURDER MY SON, ABSOLUTELY NOT. Narrator: MARK SAYS FINDING A FEW BONES PROVES NOTHING. THEY TAKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT, AND THEY TWIST IT AROUND, AND THEY TRY TO MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT IT'S NOT. IT DOESN'T CONFIRM THE HOMICIDE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE. IT CERTAIN DOESN'T CONFIRM THAT DYLAN IS A MURDER VICTIM. AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T PROVE THAT I MURDERED HIM. Narrator: HE ALSO SUGGESTS THAT HE'S BEING SET UP. EITHER DYLAN WAS ON THAT MOUNTAIN AND IS STILL ON THAT MOUNTAIN, OR DYLAN WAS NEVER ON THAT MOUNTAIN, AND THE PARTS OF HIM THAT WERE FOUND WERE PUT THERE TO INCRIMINATE ME OR TO MAKE ME LOOK GUILTY. MARK PRESENTS ANOTHER THEORY. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IF HE WAS, GETTING AWAY FROM THINGS OR WHATEVER, AND WANDERED OFF INTO THE WOODS FAR ENOUGH THAT SOMEBODY MISTAKED HIM FOR AN ANIMAL AND SHOT HIM? Narrator: TO SUPPORT HIS THEORY, MARK POSTS FACEBOOK VIDEOS DEMONSTRATING HOW EASY IT IS TO CLIMB UP THE MOUNTAIN TO THE SPOT WHERE DYLAN WAS FOUND. Mark: I CAN BARELY MAKE OUT THE ROOF ON MY HOUSE. FOR ANYBODY TO TELL ME THAT A 13-YEAR-OLD CHILD COULDN'T NAVIGATE THE TERRAIN WAS ABSURD. IT WAS VERY EASILY NAVIGATED BY A 13-YEAR-OLD. A 6-YEAR-OLD COULD HAVE NAVIGATED THE TERRAIN. WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS BECAUSE AT THAT TIME, MIDDLE MOUNTAIN WAS GETTING READY TO CLOSE. SO YOU COULDN'T EVEN REALLY GO UP THAT MOUNTAIN. Narrator: THEN, IN NOVEMBER 2015, THERE'S ANOTHER HEARTBREAKING DISCOVERY. HIKERS FIND DYLAN'S SKULL A MILE AND A HALF AWAY FROM WHERE THE REST OF HIS REMAINS WERE FOUND. HIS SKULL HAS INJURIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA. DYLAN'S MOTHER BECOMES CONVINCED THAT MARK HURT HIS OWN SON. I THINK THAT HE HARMED DYLAN IN THAT HOUSE AND DROVE DYLAN UP THE MOUNTAIN THAT NIGHT. # Narrator: FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS, NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS UNTIL JULY 2017, WHEN THERE'S A STUNNING DEVELOPMENT. A GRAND JURY HANDS DOWN AN INDICTMENT AGAINST MARK REDWINE. POLICE HUNT HIM DOWN IN WASHINGTON STATE WHERE HE'S ON THE ROAD FOR HIS JOB AS A TRUCK DRIVER. Narrator: MARK IS CHARGED WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER, AND CHILD ABUSE RESULTING IN DEATH. THE INDICTMENT REVEALS THAT DYLAN'S BLOOD WAS FOUND IN HIS DAD'S HOUSE. THEY FIND BLOOD ON A COUCH, UNDER A RUG IN THE LIVING ROOM, AND ON A COFFEE TABLE, SO IT LEADS THEM TO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE UNCOVERED A GRISLY SCENE. Narrator: DOGS ALSO PICKED UP A CADAVER SCENT IN THE HOUSE, IN THE BED OF MARK'S PICKUP TRUCK, AND ON HIS CLOTHES. BUT IN THE INTERVIEW MARK DID WITH INVESTIGATION DISCOVERY PRIOR TO HIS ARREST, HE INSISTS THAT HE WOULD NEVER HURT DYLAN. I CHERISHED EVERY MINUTE THAT I SPENT WITH THAT CHILD. HE WAS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE. THERE'S NOT ONE WORD THAT COMES FROM THAT MAN'S MOUTH THAT I BELIEVE. DYLAN'S MOM BELIEVES HIS DAD WENT AFTER DYLAN AS A WAY OF HURTING HER. I THINK HE HURT DYLAN BECAUSE IF HE COULDN'T HAVE HIM, NO ONE ELSE WAS GOING TO. HE WAS ALL ABOUT ULTIMATE REVENGE. THAT'S HIS MANTRA. THAT'S HOW HE LIVES HIS LIFE. IF I WANTED TO HURT HER, I WOULDN'T HURT DYLAN TO DO IT. I WOULD HURT HER. Narrator: MARK REDWINE HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY ON ALL CHARGES AND REMAINS BEHIND BARS IN COLORADO. HIS TRIAL IS SCHEDULED FOR LATE SUMMER 2019. DYLAN'S MOTHER HOPES IT FINALLY BRINGS HER SON JUSTICE. Elaine: MY BABY WAS SILENCED THAT NIGHT. I WANT THE RIGHT PERSON TO PAY FOR MURDERING MY CHILD. Narrator: WILL DYLAN'S FATHER GO TO JAIL FOR HIS SON'S MURDER? WILL HIS MOTHER EVER GET THE ANSWERS SHE NEEDS?
