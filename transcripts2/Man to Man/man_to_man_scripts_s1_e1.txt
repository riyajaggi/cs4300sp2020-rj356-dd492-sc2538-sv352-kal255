 White, which operates publicly with their own names. Black, which operates nameless and in the dark. Then there's Ghost, which are planted more deeply with fake identities and operate discreetly. I want you to be a Ghost operating internationally. What do you say? -Sure. -I like how quick you are. Let me give you a piece of advice for the first and last time. Don't trust anyone. -I don't even trust myself. -Good.

 LOCATION: FRANCE, CITIZENSHIP: U.S.A., NAME: JAMIE LUCAS EPISODE 1 If you were in charge of marketing for the Relief Organization, which picture would you use? The picture that shows despair and reality? Or the picture with hope and dreams? Your choice. Well, I think the picture with the sad child would get more donations. So you think we need to use a strong image to get people to open up their wallets. Then what about next time? Do the images have to get stronger and stronger? -Well, if it's for marketing... -Do you think that's morally right? Would you still make the same decision if you were the family of that child? Miss. Anna Liebert? Helping someone is more complicated than you think. When you're out there, dilemma never ends. Have we met? No. Then how do you know my real name? No one is supposed to know. Not even the professors. There is always a woman behind every case. Love is a useful deception and tactic to a secret agent. However, whereas I am with someone who is high on the romance, I feel loneliness and indifference. Anna Maria. Real name, Anna Liebert. The only daughter of the mafia boss. He adores his daughter and was in the secret police during the dictatorship. Inferior races have their special physical abilities. Just like a secret police officer would say. He won't let me interfere, since I know his secret. Do you think so? He'll remove me from his daughter for sure. He was with the secret police after all. I wonder if he'll move as we hope. People don't change that easily. I have a guest. I'll call you when I'm back. I'm willing to go quietly, but you probably won't be that nice. You're the cop. Who must I be, if I'm facing off against you? That's right. You guessed right. I'm a villain. The worst there is. CAPTAIN IRON 2, THE RETURN OF DARK DEATH You're a villain, but you aren't evil. So are you really the antagonist? Hollywood contracts are strict regarding spoilers. I understand. We can't leave out how you rose to international stardom. In the Chinese 3D movie in which you played Wu-jing Sha... There it is. When The Magical Journey to the West became a box office hit, you rose to stardom. Many are saying it was an unexpected stroke of luck. To be clear, I rose to stardom because I did well. It was possible because of our agency, Do-ha Cha's imaginative planning too. Okay. I understand. Let's move onto Dark Death, which was released yesterday. I would like to know why you chose a superhero movie. It was the pay. Would you like to walk the Cannes' red carpet? The movies I liked as a child had characters who could do a 540-degree spin kick. My goodness. Yes. Shooting a gun from each hand with a matchstick in his mouth... If you're ever in Russia, contact me. Okay. -Bye. -Bye. Petrov has been broken out of prison. MARCH 15 SQUARE Lieutenant Eun-oh Ko met with Major Petrov of the Russian Army and came to an agreement to share military technologies. The two armies plan to discuss the development of weapons as well as training methods. When working undercover, how you end it is more important than how you start it. I'm going to check that we're not being followed. Meet me at the back entrance in 20 minutes. I love you. The sympathy of a woman in love is safer than a bulletproof vest, but the wrath of a woman betrayed by her love is deadlier than a time bomb. The best way to end a relationship that has served its use is death. November 7th, 11:00 a.m. Greenwich time. Agent K. Budapest mission complete. Please wake up. I can't move. I can't move. I just can't move. You need to get up. It's past seven. No. I know the time. Your watch is fast. No. We have to be in Yangsu-ri by nine. We'll be late even if we leave now. Hey. If I'm late, you can just drive faster. You can go 100km per hour. Even if I do, we'll be 20 minutes late. Then go 150km. That means I can sleep for ten more minutes. See how quickly I calculated that? I'm a genius. I hate the gong. Croissants from Itaewon Bakery. A salad with baby greens and organic apples from Apgujeong Cafe. Fresh drip Jongro Coffee made three minutes ago. Also, here is your dessert. -What's the dressing? -I got you oriental dressing. Jongro Coffee is the best at waking me up. The cup design looks different. A branch opened in Hannam. All the better, now that it's close by. -Get me Jongro Coffee. -It is Jongro Coffee. I want Jongro Coffee from Jongro, not Jongro Coffee from Hannam. We don't have time. You have many scenes to shoot today. If you're any later... Are you planning to make your actor skip breakfast? What if my blood sugar level drops and I faint? Also, what if I have to get surgery? Then the shoot will be delayed even more. No... the movie will be canceled. Well, you just got the movie canceled just because you didn't get Jongro Coffee from Jongro. It's just a different color. Go. Go! Hello. Why are you so late? I'm sorry. We tried to rush, but... Sheesh. -Hello. -Hello. GREAT ACTOR, UN-GWANG YEO What a nice day. -Hey. -Hello. We had to take a detour because Mr. Yang got lost. Everyone makes mistakes once in a while, but he makes them often. Mr. Yang. Apologize sincerely. I'm sorry. In exchange, I'll make sure not to make any mistakes, so that we can do it all in one take, okay? I'm counting on you. -I'll have to work really hard. -Good luck. I'll repay you for your faith in me. -Good luck. -Seriously... -How's your debut preparation going? -Great, of course. What you showed me last time was awesome. Jongro coffee from Jongro. BIG STAR, UN-GWANG YEO Come at me! DELINQUENT BROTHERS Here. Organic Cheongdam Lemonade. -Hello. -Hello. Is it from Cheongdam? It's not from Yeouido or Gwanghwamun, right? -What are you babbling about? -I don't know. Maybe it's because he is an action star. He's so fit and doesn't he have a great figure? He's more beautiful than a flower. Hey. -I'm sorry. -Get your act together! Hey. It's okay. It's okay. I'm good at that. I'm awesome at blocking hits. Don't let it get you down. Okay, let's go. Let's take it from the top. -From the top. -Okay. Here. How can someone be so perfect? -A perfect fake. -He's human. He is humanity's enemy. He may be an alien. My Love From The Star? -Soo-hyun Kim or Un-gwang? -Un-gwang, obviously. -Un-gwang or ten million dollars? -Definitely the latter. At least you're not in critical condition yet. Un-gwang likes money. Here he comes. Why did you skip the Top Ten Corporations Luncheon at the Blue House and come here instead? My promise to my son comes first. Why did you send your son to a public school rather than private school? I want to raise a child who gets almost everything regarding education. I will raise him to be a child who knows how much the bus fare costs and knows how to share with others. Some question if you're doing this because you want to enter politics. Let me make it clear that politics is not for me. I'm here as a dad. There she is. Hello. Honey. -Hi. -Good job. Don't smile too much. When Jae-young comes out, pick him up naturally. Okay. Here he comes. -Honey. -Mom! -Come here. -Did you have fun? What? Are you really going to stand against me and Songsan, Congressman Kim? You don't belong in the political world. You took a box home from this room frequently when my grandfather was around. Just because he passed away, did you bury those memories as well? You make it sound like I took bribes or something. Do you have evidence to back that up? All I did in this room was eat a few hot meals that your grandfather had prepared for me. Then you should accept mine, too. It's more satisfying than the Seoul mayoral elections in which you would come in third at best anyway. Your sweet granddaughter is studying in Chicago, is she not? -Is that a threat? -It's a gift. Goodness. I don't know about this. In consideration of my long relationship with your grandfather, I will withdraw from the election. You have no spirit, you filthy pig. You know people take pictures at the dining table nowadays, right? There is a new king, so there are new rules too. We've lost touch with Ghost Agent Y. I think he's been taken out. Are you saying his cover was blown? His cover was perfect. He was able to go deep and gain the trust of those involved with Songsan's chairman, Mr. Mo's slush fund. But they still got him. That means we have a traitor on the inside. Was it Congressman In-soo Baek's secret organization, the Baek Infantry? We can't trust anyone on the inside. I'll call in an international agent. Do you have someone in mind? Yes, sir. Hello. Thank you. Room service. What now? What? What is it now? What are you up to now? What's with the mustache? -Is it obvious? -Yes. Very. Darn it. Just go back to being an agent then. Quit being a prosecutor. I can't. My wife will kill me. Then why did you follow me here? To give you your mission. My mission is to follow you and manage you. I'm your commanding officer. -Me? -Yes. -Goodness. I'm on vacation. -It's urgent, that's why. Okay. Look. You know the code, right? Your birthday, 0906. Half the hotel staff must know. That's right. Goodness. What is it? I think Agent Yoon's been taken out. He disappeared after sending a text message. Container 8675 to Incheon October 4th. Look for three wood carvings. Y. "Look for three wood carvings." Yes. We're tracking the container with the clue he sent. -What's my new identity? -We're looking. Where is the mission? Somewhere nobody knows you. Okay. Look here. -Would you like some? -I'm fine. This is the last one. You must really want some. -Here. -There is a way. Cut. Okay. -Was that okay? -Yes, it was good. -The emotions were good. -Thank you. You looked good together. Next is the kissing scene. We'll be zooming in, -so make it hot. -Okay. -Stunt team. Get ready. -Yes, sir. Let's use a stunt double. A stunt double? You said it's a kiss scene. We should use a stunt double then. You did all the action scenes yourself without using a stunt double. So why do you... I can hit things with my head or a car, but not my lips. I don't do that. Okay? I'm speechless. -It must be true. -What is? That he can't kiss actresses. That feels nice. Good job for today. Sure. I was a bit pissed off earlier, but it's okay. I understand. -What? -Not being able to kiss a woman. -Me? -I won't tell anyone, so don't worry. -What are you doing? -Teaching you the facts. I don't do kissing scenes, but I'm a good kisser. My phone. Who is it? What? The agency. The agency. -Hi, Ms. Cha. -Where are you? I'm talking to Director Hong about the movie. -It's running longer than expected. -Okay. You should continue talking, I'll call you later. -This isn't right. -Why? Is something wrong? I feel like something will happen. I feel like something big and ominous is approaching. What are you talking about? What is that? Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! -What's going on? -Stop! Hold on. Stop! -Stop! Hey! -What's wrong with her? Stay still. Hey, Ms. Cha! What do you think you're doing? Who is she? She must be crazy. Hello, Director Hong. You got a whole bunch of plastic surgery within those few hours. She really must be crazy. Hey, Ms. Cha. First, calm down. We should talk about it and resolve it rationally. You shouldn't resort to violence! -Whatever. -What? I promised you the last time you got caught, didn't I? That if I catch you again, you and I will both die. But I realized it wouldn't be fair for me to die, so I'll just kill you. Hey. Ms. Cha. Calm down, will you? Hey. Hey, calm down. Hey. Hold on. Hold on. Is she your manager? -She wouldn't really drop us, would she? -She could. She used to be in my fan club. She's totally capable. A fangirl? Ms. Cha! I never made a promise or anything. -Goodness. Hold on! -Can't you let me off... -Please? -That self-centered witch. -Please? -I ought to just... Hey! Hey! Where are we going? Hey. Hey! Ms. Cha! I mean it. We were only talking about the movie. I said it was Director Hong in case you got it wrong... Do-ha. We're not late to a shoot. Why are you speeding? You'll blind the drivers on the other side if you keep the high beam on, Do-ha. Please calm down. Please. Fine, I did it. I did. I kissed her. This old man wasn't thinking. It's my lips' fault. These wretched lips. Why are you so extreme? I know you're in your prime. A man in his 40s is perfect financially, physically and professionally. Love isn't a sin. Is it? I guess not. But a star like you dating is a sin. You shouldn't have gotten caught. Do-ha. Do-ha! Ever since you went to Jae-young's kindergarten, the media has been very favorable. You have such a good sense. I've lived my entire life in politics, but I'm learning from you. It's thanks to my wife. She used to be a celebrity, so she knows what the public wants. May I have her join my campaign staff for the mayoral election? Congressman Kim won't be greedy any longer. Thanks to you, I think this election will go smoothly. This is the land on Jeju Island. It should be the amount you mentioned. If you add it to your campaign fund, you can write up a receipt, right? Just kidding. Go ahead and use it. But no matter how wealthy I am, I won't keep having money that I can't get receipts for. I'll do whatever it takes to find the missing wood carvings. They are the details of the slush fund my grandfather saved for 40 years. Without them, I have to keep bribing people like Congressman Kim. My connections from the NIS are working on it. Discreet operations like these are my specialty. Please give it your all. INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS ARRIVED Ghost Agent K has begun tracking it based on the text message the missing agent sent. How interesting. -A ghost agent. A nameless shadow. -Right. -What a great concept. -It totally is. But what did K do before? DOUBLE LIFE (WORKING TITLE) He couldn't have taken a test to join the NIS. I don't know. He's coming, so ask him yourself. The nameless shadow agent whom no one has ever seen -is coming here? -Yes. How did you contact the shadow? I texted him. I'll call him if it's urgent. If he doesn't answer, I'll go to him. You're terrible. The aim of this movie is to show the real world of secret agents. What I'm telling you is real. -Were you really with NIS? -I was. I can't pay you for the scenario consultation if you keep this up. Why don't you believe me? Look. See? He texted me to meet at 3:00 p.m. Goodness. -That's him contacting you? -Yes. There he is. Over here. Introduce yourselves. He is Suk-yoo Kwon, a director who consults scenarios with me. This is whom I told you about. Mr. K. Goodness. Mr. K. I've heard so much about you. He's a fraud, so watch yourself. Okay, then. I'll leave now and let you two talk. -Why? -I'm busy. Mr. Kwon. Hey. Mr. Kwon. Damn it. -Can't you please... -Have a seat. Hey. He won't believe me even if I told him the truth anyway. I can tell him many times. He'll say I made it up. -Where's the first wood carving? -Yes. The location of the first wood carving that we found by tracking the container is in Russia. The oil tycoon, Chairman Victor. The arms dealer Chairman Victor's secret safe. But he's so strict about security, that everything's hidden, including the location of his house. What? You're wondering about the plan? Of course, we have one. The fan meeting of Korean star, Un-gwang Yeo. A fan meeting? UN-GWANG YEO UN-GWANG YEO'S PROFILE "Name, Un-gwang Yeo. Age 43. Started as a stunt man and is now an actor. He debuted in 2011 in A Detective's Enemy." UN-GWANG YEO'S PROFILE JONGRO COFFEE, JONGRO BRANCH "Jongro Coffee, Jongro branch"? JONGRO COFFEE Is this in English? He's a foreigner. It's Chairman Victor's secret birthday party. Secret, my ass. What am I supposed to do at an old man's birthday party? What are you thinking? He isn't just any old man. Victor is a chairman. He's one of Forbes' top 30 richest men alive. That's right. Someone like that is your fan. If you go and shake his hand a few times and take a few pictures with him, he's going to invest in some Hollywood movies. Then will I be the sole lead in Dark Death? Yes, if you go and wish Chairman Victor a happy birthday. Come on. If an old man asks for a favor, of course, I should pay my respects. I haven't lost my humility. Every single fan is precious. Look at this. My goodness. This is very expensive and precious. It's so warm. Okay. Then I'll set it up. -Good boy. -Yes. Seriously, I love how simple you are. As the lead character in Hollywood... Of course, you should go. We'll go with this. What a nice camera. I'll only delete Un-gwang's photos. -Who are you? -Who are you? I know every reporter. Whom are you with? You don't want to say who you are, but you're working hard taking pictures. You're a paparazzi, aren't you? Even if he is a celebrity, you can't take his pictures like this. That's the law. What is this? What is this? You looked pretty. I'm dumb, so I want to remember. If I catch you again, I'll press charges. No negotiations or settlements. FORMAT CARD DELETE ALL FILES? DELETING Use a lighter camera. NOLBOO RESTAURANT The youth unemployment issue certainly is a problem. Young people are making a living by being a paparazzi. So you let him go? You know I hate the authorities. What's the point in sending him to jail? He'll just meet bad people and become an even worse person. Hey. With a face like this, you should've gotten his number and see how things play out. Even when a man says, "You looked pretty" to someone he just met? Exactly. How many men who look like that would tell you that you look pretty? Tell me. NO IMAGES I'll delete only Un-gwang's photos. NO IMAGES RESTORING DELETED FILES DELETED FILES RESTORED RESTORED FILES RESTORED FILES, PICTURES Do-ha Cha. What are you doing? Are you working? I thought you were taking the day off. Something was nagging at me, so I was examining the plan. What was? -Who's that? -Un-gwang Yeo's manager. There's always a beautiful woman where there's a plan. -So what's nagging at you? -Nothing much. What is all that? Manual for Going Undercover and the movies he was in. He did these too? WE DID IT IN SECRET That one is awesome. Would you like to walk the Cannes' red carpet? Cannes' red carpet? Well, let's see. The movies I liked as a child had characters who could do a 540-degree spin kick. Or they could send the evil villains straight to hell. I liked such spectacular martial arts movies. Also, shooting a gun from each hand with a matchstick in his mouth and giving his life, his youth, for justice. Extreme action romance noir! Those are the kinds of movies I liked. I see. You seem very excited when you talk about movies that you like. Someone said that before. Pardon? I must have wanted to prove that I could become a Hollywood superhero. Because I... am an action actor. I see. Thank you. Your passion for action is incredible. According to next year's lineup of Hero Comics movies, there is a movie in which Dark Death Scorpion... Hello, madam. Should I ring up everything from here to there? I don't need a lot of clothes. My body looks better the less I have on. I see. You know, right? You're my friend, but you're quite annoying. -I haven't seen this before. -It's this season's main item. I'm going to make it the main item in the photo spread with Un-gwang. A black jacket on Un-gwang. -You should reconsider. -Why? -Don't you think he'll wear it? -It'll be hard to get him to. I would like to get fitted for the evening gown I saw last time. It's been waiting for you in the fitting room. Come with me, madam. I'm sorry I'm late. I know you're a busy man. I'm sure you called because it was urgent. I had a request to make too. Why don't you go first? -Any pictures of the wood carving? -None. Is the information on the secret safe in? Obviously, I have nothing. How about the floor plan of Chairman Victor's house? You must know where the house is, right? Agent Yoon was very thorough. He hid it so well that no one would ever find it. I'm out. That's why you need to make sure his fan meeting works out. -But look... -Grab Un-gwang Yeo's hand and go. That's the only way. If this falls through, we have no way in. CHAIRMAN VICTOR CHAIRMAN OF VIC ENERGY KOREAN STAR INVITATION REQUIRED FOR ENTRY. GUEST LIST Tug. -Done. -Stop that. Do I look good? Let's go. How does your skin look better with time? I was born this way. What should I wear? -Come with me. -Sure. Mr. Jang! Let's grab a drink. Maybe I should've stayed with the NIS. You're looking good, now that you are a senior manager. Why do you keep coming? You should've just stayed then. I can't. My wife hates hospitals and the NIS office the most. Everyone thinks you retired and became a prosecutor. It's suspicious if you keep coming. This is the safest place. They can't bug this place either. Did you find anyone on the list I gave you that seemed suspicious? Here. Take a look. I looked as much as I could through my prosecutor connections, but none of them killed Agent Yoon. We'll have to find Songsan's chairman's ledger that he hid and look at the names. By the way, I took care of what you asked. Okay. Then we'll proceed with the fan meeting as planned. My money. I'll pay you back double the amount if there's a problem, so don't worry. Look. There is definitely a hole. But... -Awesome. -It's fine, right? -Incredible. -That's a real pen. How did he do that? There was definitely a hole. I'll use a coin this time. It's gone. It's back. It's gone again. Over here. -What happened? -My bad. -You're so cute. -Right? You're definitely not a magician. You're so super cool. Isn't that the paparazzi? -What is this? -You looked pretty. He's so persistent. Did you really come all the way here? I practiced that so much. That's so cool. What's his deal? What is he doing? Maybe it's a fake bill. What the... No, it's real. Is he a pickpocket? Why that... -Amazing. So cool. -I know. Hey. Where did that pale, whatever-looking man go to? -Did you see him too? -Isn't he so dreamy? Isn't he breathtakingly gorgeous? What the hell? -He's so cool. -He's so cool. Seriously. That looks great on you. The bright color looks good. Red is my color. You never have to worry about what color to dress me in. A strong red is always the answer for Mr. Yeo. Right? It looks good to you too, right? Why is that woman here? Me? I'm the client. Songsan took over this brand. You look good in red as always. -I won't wear this. I refuse! -Sweetie, that's not it. Switch the main item or I won't do the shoot. Should I just leave? I'll pay the penalty. How much is it? Good. Okay. Good. Bravo. Looking great. It was exactly as you said. I wondered what you meant by dressing him in red first, if I wanted him to wear black. He'll probably never wear red ever again. Hey! Are you okay? Yes. -Okay, then. -Okay. I've got you. I saw everything. Well, well. See? Look at this. My wallet. What's going on? You were a paparazzi last time and now you're a pickpocket? -Jung-hye, call the guards. -Okay. What's going on? He stole our staff's wallet. He's a pickpocket. That's not all. Earlier, I saw him taking this. Yes, this. This is an entry card he stole from our stylist. Also, this passport, he stole from Mr. Yang. Let's see. Everything is in here. This passport belongs to Un-gwang? Who are you? Are you his fanboy? Ms. Cha! What are you doing? Take your hands off of him! Sir, he stole Un-gwang's... It hurts! Let me go. Let me go. Hey. Let... Damn it. As you had guessed, Mr. Yeo's security is terrible. Yes, well... I am your head of security as of today. Okay. He's the type that Un-gwang hates. When the VIP is about to be late, his bodyguard should take care of it. A bodyguard's top priorities are the VIP's life and safety. What kind of a bodyguard makes a bomb? I'll die and disappear once this mission is completed anyway. He acts strange. What did you misunderstand? "You looked pretty"? What he says is strange. I've got you. Fire him. Right away. You're fired. Subtitle translation by Jeong
