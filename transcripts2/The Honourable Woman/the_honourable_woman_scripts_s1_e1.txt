 The Honourable Woman (2014): Season 1, Episode 1 - The Empty Chair - full transcript 
 As a child Nessa Stein and her younger brother Ephra witnessed the murder in public of their father Eli, an Israeli arms dealer. Twenty-nine years later Nessa, her father's heiress, has turned the firm around, specializing in promoting communications between Israel and Palestine and establishing a charitable foundation for which she has been made a peeress in the English House of Lords. Nessa is about to deal with Palestinian businessman Samir Meshal, to the annoyance of family friend Shlomo, a deal which attracts the attention of Hugh Hayden-Hoyle, an MI6 operative on the verge of retirement, and Monica Chatwin, his rival and designated successor. Meshal kills himself, a death Nessa finds suspicious and she is reminded of a successful attempt to kidnap her in the Gaza Strip eight years before. Sadly there is another abduction in the present, when Kasim, the little son of Ephra's nanny Atika, is kidnapped . Nessa gives chase and the abductor draws a gun on her. He is killed by Nathaniel Bloom, Nessa's minder, but he too is shot and the abductor gets away with Kasim.

 Who do you trust?
 How do you know?
 By how they appear?
 Or what they say...
 ...what they do?
 How?
 We all have secrets.
 We all tell lies,
just to keep them...
 from each other...
 ...and from ourselves.
 But sometimes...
 ...rarely...
 ...something can happen
that leaves you no choice...
 ...but to reveal it.
 To let the world see who you really are.
 Your secret self.
 But mostly, we tell lies.
 We hide our secrets
from each other,
 from ourselves.
 And the easiest way to do this
is not to even know that you are.
 So, when you think about it like that...
 ...it's a wonder we trust anyone at all.
 Modeh ani I'faneykha.
 Don't be afraid.
 I'm safe.
 I can't do this.
 If it's the price...for a nation.
 I, Nessa, Baroness Stein of Tilbury,
 in the county of Essex,
 do solemnly, sincerely,
 and truly declare...
 Wait here.
 ...that I will be faithful...
 ...and bear true allegiance
 to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth...
 ...her heirs and successors...
 ...according to law.
 So help me God.
 Well, the girls won't manage any of this.
 Atika, the girls won't eat any of this.
Would you be a sweetheart
 and ask them if they could have
something simpler?
 Of course, Mrs Stein.
 Stay still, Kasim.
 Why does she always do that?
 Use my surname. It makes me look bad.
 There you are, my lovely Rachel.
 You look wonderful!
 I wonder why you still keep him!
 Eh, my boy.
 All good?
 Your sister. Ah, a Lady.
 Who'd have thought?
 Come here. Give old Shlomo a hug!
 Are you all right?
 So, have I got it?
 I don't know.
 Even if I did, I couldn't tell you,
could I?
 Well, you could give me a hint cos
I've seen the shit in your nappies.
 Nessa runs the business, Shlomo.
 Now, yes. But there was a time...
 I just run the Foundation.
 If you're looking for a job as a professor
or something,
 then maybe I could help you out.
 Professor! I've got three ways
I spell my own name.
 Do I need to find a new job?
 Shlomo, I don't know, honestly. All you
have to do is wait a couple of minutes.
 She's going to announce it in her speech.
 Why so theatrical?
 You can't leak these things.
It wouldn't be fair, would it?
 And you've always got to be fair, right?
 It's how we survive, Shlomo.
 Is that why that Palestinian bastard
Samir Meshal has been invited?
 Everyone who's put in a tender
has been invited.
 Hasn't turned up yet, I see.
 Well...
 Waiting to make some big fucking
entrance on some big fucking camel
 just to prove he's such
a big fucking Arab, huh?
 I tell you, he wins that contract
and I get my hands on his neck...
 fuck the Six-Day War,
it'll be over in seconds.
 - Best of luck.
 So now I need luck, eh?
 Shlomo!
 Hello...what a day!
 I can't tell you how heavy that robe is!
 I do have an announcement to make,
 but first I'd just like to say
a couple of things.
 The violinist here today is
Mustapha Shamar.
 He's a virtuoso,
 he's a graduate of
the Stein Music Centre in Ramallah
 and this Saturday night,
he's going to be playing
 at the Royal College of Music.
 I can't think of a better example of
what we're trying to achieve here.
 And I'm certain that
he would not be here today
 if it weren't for one man...
 my brother, Ephra Stein.
 Unlike his sister, he doesn't court
the limelight,
 probably because
he's an awful lot cleverer than me.
 But as President of the Stein Foundation,
it's his educational programmes
 that make sense of everything else
I try to do.
 So make no mistake,
as this is my hand, that is his!
 Thank you, Ephra.
 Where is Kasim?
 Have you seen Kasim?
 OK. I'm looking.
 So, these aliens decide to invade Earth,
and to show they mean business,
 what they do is, first,
they destroy London, then New York,
 and then they land,
right on the Green Line
 between Israel and the West Bank.
 And they decide to call a meeting
 between the Palestinian Authority
and the Israeli Government.
 And their message is simple.
 "Resistance is useless!
Lay down your arms!"
 I can't really tell you
the detail of what happened next,
 but basically by the end of it
your sympathy was with the aliens.
 29 years ago,
 my father, Eli Stein,
 was murdered here in this room.
 He was a wonderful father
to my brother and me.
 But first and foremost,
I think it's fair to say,
 he was a great son of Israel.
 He arrived here in Britain in 1939,
 a refugee and an orphan.
 This country took him in,
and the protection it offered
 became the defining experience
of his life.
 Eli Stein believed
that no home could thrive
 unless it was surrounded by strong walls.
 And so, yes, it's true.
 His company name, my family name,
 was stamped on the side of mortar shells
and rifles and tanks...
 because that's what my father
offered Israel.
 Strong walls for a fledgling nation.
 And that's what cost him his life,
here in this room...
 ...29 years ago.
 Kasim?
 Last year,
Israel's gross domestic product
 exceeded 220 billion dollars.
 I know my father would be
very proud of that figure.
 A fledgling state no more,
I think you'll agree,
 but one that's thriving
within strong walls.
 Last year, the combined domestic product
 of the Palestinian territories
barely touched four billion dollars.
 Four.
 What a difference a wall makes.
 I believe in Israel and I believe
I can say this with heartfelt intent,
 because like her, I am also an orphan.
 I lost most of my extended family
to the Holocaust,
 my father here in this room,
 and my mother to childbirth,
delivering me.
 My brother and I know what it means
 to have to forge an existence alone,
without family.
 Kasim?
 And how precious it is, no...
 It's Mummy!
 ...how necessary it is to feel
 secure after such a loss.
 But when Ephra and I
took over this company,
 almost a decade ago now,
we decided on a fundamental change.
 In our view,
amongst the greatest threats to Israel
 is Palestinian poverty.
 Terror thrives in poverty,
 it dies in wealth.
 And so we decided that instead of mines,
we would lay cables.
 Millions of miles of cables,
for telephones, for the internet,
 millions of miles of communication.
 Because we believe that the strongest wall
 we can help Israel to maintain,
 is the one through which
equality of opportunity can pass.
 Kasim?
 And so today,
after months of negotiation with both
 the Palestinian Authority
and the Israeli Government,
 I am finally in a position to announce
 that the Phase Three roll-out
of broadband internet
 throughout the West Bank has been agreed.
 Fibre optic...
 linking every university, every hospital,
 every school to high-speed internet.
 Universities we helped fund
 to give hospitals we helped to build
the graduates they need.
 Are you lost?
 As you know, the Stein Group is
always looking to make partnerships
 and I know the competition for
this particular contract has been fierce.
 But I am now in a position
to say that the winner
 of the Phase Three contract...
 ...is Samir Meshal
of Qassim Communications.
 Is he here?
 Kasim!
 He was nice.
 He was a stranger!
And what do strangers do?
 They steal little boys
who don't tell their mother
 where they're going, OK?
 Great. Come on.
 What the fuck you think you've done?
 - I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're sorry?
 I rolled out Phase One and Phase Two
just for you and now you're sorry?
 Samir fucking Meshal.
 That guy is so mired
in Palestinian politics,
 he opens his eyes,
they're still covered in shit.
 He's clean, Shlomo. We checked.
 - Oh, you checked.
- Just like we have to check on
 everyone who wants to work with us.
 Just like we had to check on you.
 Well, what's that?
 In October 2009, you received
a contract for $287 million
 from a Lebanese French private bank
to supply computer systems,
 which were then shipped
to a West African state.
 The proceeds of their resale were then
returned to a Lebanese holding account,
 where they were then layered through
a number of further shell companies
 until the laundered funds finally arrived
back to their original source.
 Hezbollah.
 This is bullshit.
 I'm sure the original sale
was perfectly legal
 and you were unaware of what followed.
 But, unfortunately, we had to be.
 What the fuck...?
 Where'd you get this?
 All right, it's not true.
 You listening to me? It's not true.
 We cannot carry secrets, Shlomo. Ever.
 But it isn't one of them.
Whoever gave you this is lying.
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
 Sorry! You're sorry, for Christ's sakes!
Ness, I...
 Ephra, pull your sister in line!
 Like I said, Shlomo,
she runs the business.
 Oh, she runs the business.
 Are you...are you mad?
Are you fucking mad?
 You're getting rid of me?
 I've been loyal to your family
longer than you've been alive.
 - I know that.
- You know, you know.
 You keep picking and choosing
and dropping and fucking up,
 pretty soon you end up on your own.
 And out there...
 trust me, you can't be alone.
 I'm not alone.
 Oh, you think a red robe
is going to protect you, huh?
 Is that what this is,
some massive father thing?
 You think that place is going to
protect you? Because it can't.
 All they want to do is keep you
so close you can't escape
 when they decide to knife you.
 Nessa, my daughter,
you have enemies enough already.
 It's the Middle East, Shlomo.
Enemies is what you make.
 So all the more reason
to keep your friends.
 I'm sorry.
 So what does it feel
like to be in the House of Lords?
 - A great honour.
- But why you?
 I hope it's a reflection of
the UK's continuing commitment
 to the Middle East and to progressive ways
of thinking about it.
 It's a controversial appointment, though.
 No, no controversy.
 I was interviewed extensively.
 I'll serve as an independent cross-bencher
 with no party affiliation whatsoever.
None.
 But you're an Israeli.
 Well, I was born and raised in the UK,
my companies are based here,
 the Stein Group is here,
we employ over 3,000 people here
 with annual exports of over 350 million
on which we pay UK tax,
 both personal and corporate...
 So, I think that makes me a UK citizen,
don't you?
 Well, you do hold an Israeli passport.
 Anyone with direct Jewish ancestry
holds that right.
 Well, you certainly have the ancestry.
 Eli Stein, The Sword Of Israel,
your father.
 That's quite an inheritance.
 Well, I hope you'll recognise
that it's precisely
 because of what we've chosen
to do with it that I'm here today.
 Do you have close protection, Lady Stein?
 Yes, I do.
 Why?
 It's an unfortunate necessity.
 But you're meant to be
everyone's friend, aren't you?
 There are militant factions on both sides,
so realistically...
 Sorry, but are you a realist?
 Because as an idealist,
 I'd completely understand
why you'd need a bodyguard.
 After all, when it comes to
the history of the Middle East
 it never ends well for idealists,
does it?
 - Hello.
- Hi.
 It was so good to see you!
Thank you for coming...
 - Hello.
- Hello!
 Wonderful speech.
 It's been ages since I've seen
both of you. Hope you're happy.
 Thank you.
 Thank you so much for coming.
 - Hello.
- Monica Chatwin. Foreign Office.
 Washington bureau.
 - Although I'm due to return here soon.
 I have a particular interest
in the Middle East.
 I see.
 And I just wanted to say hello
so you can put a face to the name.
 Well, now you have. Thank you.
 Don't worry about it.
 Hello. I can't tell you how much...
 Run along and find Mummy,
I'll come down soon.
 So nice to see you all here.
Thank you.
 I hope from now on you'll feel
you have all the support you deserve.
 - From whom?
- The British Government.
 - The support, but not influence.
- Of course not.
 It's simply recognition of the UK's
historic responsibility
 - to the Middle East.
- I hope so.
 Oh, I know so.
I heard it from the Prime Minister's lips.
 Excuse me, what job exactly
are you about to take on, Mrs...
 - Monica...
- ...Chatwin?
 Oh, sh...
 But I'm sure you'll be asking
your security
 the moment I've turned my back.
 - Congratulations!
- Thank you very much.
 - It really is a wonderful day.
- Thank you.
 MI6.
 Julia Walsh is bringing her back
to run the Middle East desk.
 - I thought Hayden-Hoyle was doing that?
- So does he.
 Why are you here?
 To congratulate your sister.
 Leave her alone.
 I just offered her my help.
 She doesn't need your help.
 She has before,
and I think she might again.
 Stay away from my sister.
 It's my job, Ephra, keeping secrets.
 So what are you worrying about?
 Yours is perfectly safe.
 OK, just a couple more minutes.
 What have you been
doing with your hands?
 Sorry.
 Where have you been?
 Just someone I haven't seen in years.
 All right? All right.
 Oh, Nessa. What they do to our bodies,
you would never believe.
 Hello.
 Hello.
 That's a very big watch.
 Are you lost?
 Well, let's hope not.
 We're ready.
 They're all good names.
 And who might be your choice
for successor?
 Julia knows my choice.
He's been my deputy for three years.
 And if it wasn't him?
 Then it wouldn't be my choice.
 The next one, please.
 It's not my choice.
 When?
 Well, obviously, we'd like you
to finish up on whatever's outstanding.
 And then you'll be free.
 You haven't asked me who it's going to be.
 Is it you?
 Oh, no, no.
 I'm not a... Actually, what are you?
 Oh, a son of a...Lord?
 Baronet.
 Baronet. From Ireland.
 Now there's a conflict.
 Maybe that's why they gave me
the Middle East.
 It's a dangerous kind of spy,
 Sir Hugh, who even lies to himself.
 Wait.
 You really want these so much?
 And this is just so perfect.
 Because we all know
that's how you really got the job...
 Well, I don't suppose
you fucked Dame Julia with them on.
 Sir Hugh.
 Lady Hoyle.
 I tore up that name with our credit cards,
Hugh.
 Just one of the many things
I've left behind.
 I like your hair.
 Is that the line you always use?
 Because I'm surprised it's ever worked.
 What do you want?
 If I'd told you the truth,
would you have stayed?
 I'm too tired.
 I only lied because
I didn't want to hurt you.
 Hugh, most people get fucked
by their job, not for it.
 Still...at least you got a nice car.
 Not sure for how long.
 Is that sulphur I can smell?
 I'm not a devil, Angie.
 Didn't say you were.
 But I'm sure you've made a deal with one.
 Samir Meshal.
 Palestinian. Multimillionaire.
Telecommunications.
 I know him.
 He's dead.
 Suicide. Approximately two o'clock
this afternoon.
 How?
 Hung himself from a flagpole
wrapped in his national flag.
 How very patriotic.
 Are you sure it's suicide?
 From what I can gather, he left a note.
 This...
 Definitely from him?
 Well, those are his fingerprints.
It's addressed to his wife.
 Do you think if I'd learnt to read Arabic,
 it would have made my job
a whole lot easier?
 Sir.
 Why'd it come to us?
 This.
 We need to speak to the Israelis.
 I'll set up a meeting.
 For a formal response, go right ahead,
 but for a truthful one, or at least
the chance of it, leave it with me.
 Sir.
 Someone about to win
a multimillion contract
 just goes and puts a rope round his neck?
 Maybe he couldn't stand the wait.
 You think he's been killed?
 You don't?
 It's odd, I agree.
 Someone gets cancer,
I think they've been given it.
 I'll look into it.
 I was so happy this morning.
 Didn't even make the day.
 I won't be going out again tonight.
 We'll be here, sir.
 You can go home.
 Just in case.
 And that's supposed
to make me feel better?
 Good night, sir.
 Good night.
 I'm going out.
 Hello.
 Hey, good to see you.
 - Lovely to see you.
- OK.
 - Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.
 Knight to B6.
 Interesting.
 It's OK. It's OK. It's OK, it's OK.
 Can I get you something to drink?
 Go away.
 I can't do this.
 I can't...
 Yes, you can.
 We're strong, you and I.
 What if they find out?
 They won't.
 They might...
 They will never find out. I promise.
 Never. Never.
 It's OK. It's OK.
 I wanted to celebrate.
 Everything will be fine.
 Nessa.
 OK? Trust me. Trust me.
 OK? OK?
 OK?
 The Israeli Government
has had no hand in this.
 Yes, Judah, I understand.
 From what I hear, it was a suicide.
 Because of the note?
 Is what I hear.
 They found fingerprints on the letter.
 Is what I hear.
 But not on the envelope, Judah.
 And yet that's where we found
the letter...
 ...inside the envelope.
 Now how is that possible?
 The last time I saw that trick,
it was David Nixon and Ali Baba.
 I don't know them.
 It wasn't us.
 - The Mossad?
- No.
 - Kidron?
- No.
 Was he on your graph?
 I'm about to be retired.
 So this will probably be my last case.
 And like every good spy,
when I leave a case...
 ...I like to leave it...
 ...empty.
 Are you all right?
 She needed to see me.
 Is she OK?
 She'll be fine.
 What's wrong?
 She'll be fine, Ephra.
 Trust me.
 Good night.
 Are you lost?
 We think the Israelis killed him.
 And who is it exactly
that's thinking that?
 The entire Palestinian Authority
or just you?
 I speak on behalf of my country,
Baroness Stein,
 for whom Samir Meshal
has become a martyr.
 We don't know that.
 They don't want you to choose
a Palestinian. They want an Israeli.
 It doesn't matter what anyone wants,
Mr Muraji.
 We want you to choose a Palestinian.
 I will choose whoever best protects
the aims and ideals of this company
 and nothing you or anyone else wants
will affect that decision.
 You cannot choose an Israeli...
 not after this.
 I'll choose exactly who I want.
 Then you will have made a mistake.
 And if I do, at least it will be mine.
 Don't be afraid?
 Everything is going to be all right.
 OK?
 It's going to be more than that,
it'll be great.
 So, once we're inside,
we've agreed to a short interview about
 the Academy and what we're trying
to do in Ramallah, but obviously
 they'll probably want a comment
on whatever's going on outside.
 I don't want to be drawn.
 Then don't be. The message is music.
 So it's, um...it's vocal but contained.
 You're set up to go in the main entrance,
 - but there is an alternative.
- Which is?
 The rear loading bay.
It's an easy drive in.
 No. Main entrance.
 It's meant to be a celebration,
not a run for a bunker.
 All right, straight in, OK?
 Tonight is really about
celebrating this music
 and celebrating
this extraordinary musician.
 But everywhere you go,
you bring this with you.
 I'm sorry, we really have to go now.
 Do you know what? Can I say...?
 I don't pretend to have
an all-encompassing solution,
 clearly we don't, but with
what we're trying to do here,
 at least we're no longer
part of the problem.
 - You all right?
- Yeah.
 Hey.
 - Hi.
- Are you all right?
 - Yeah.
- Sure?
 Yeah.
 Where's Rachel?
 Her ankles are a bit swollen,
it's a late-pregnancy thing.
 Where's Atika?
 Well, she thought it best
if she stayed at home as well, it's fine.
 It's fine, it's fine.
 I'm quite capable of looking after
my own kids...
 - aren't I?
- Are you OK?
 They need you backstage.
 Who's looking after them?
 This gentleman's going to take us in.
 Are you cleared?
 Yes, of course he's cleared.
 Are you cleared? Is he cleared?
 Yeah, he's cleared, it's fine.
 - Come on, glasses, drink up.
- It's fine.
 Mazel, this one.
 Come on, darling, do you want
to take this, this last one?
 Fingers crossed for the Star Wars theme.
 Hello.
 Welcome to this unique and historic event.
 I've been asked to say a few words
 and do you know what?
That's literally all I'm going to do
 because tonight I really think
the music should speak for itself.
 So enjoy.
 What?
 It's all right, everything's fine.
Just stay where you are.
 - Take us to the rear loading bay now.
- OK.
 Kasim. It's just a fire alarm,
but follow me.
 Quick as you can.
 Possible fire, meet us
at the rear loading bay. Over.
 - Kasim!
- Kasim?
 Come back. Wait, wait, wait, wait...
 Kasim?
 Kasim?!
 - Wait!
- What?
 Hello?
 Kasim!
 Excuse me!
 I'll wait there.
 Kasim!
 What do you want?!
 Kasim!
