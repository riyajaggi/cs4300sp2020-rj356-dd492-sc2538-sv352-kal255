 The Honourable Woman (2014): Season 1, Episode 8 - The Paring Knife - full transcript 
 Believing that Nessa was killed by an Israeli-backed terrorist group the American government prepares to accept Palestine as a sovereign state and Julia Walsh accuses Palestinian sympathizer Monica of helping to engineer this, using Nessa as a pawn. Nessa comes to in a house with Kasim and rings Shlomo to announce that she is alive. Acting on the call Hayden-Hoyle persuades Atika, who was aware of, and part of, the plot that she owes it to Nessa to rescue her, which she does, killing the father of Al-Zahid, who ordered her rape and her family's murders. Though mortally wounded Atika helps Nessa and Kasim escape to Israel and back to England, where they visit Rachel and her new-born baby.

 'Who do you trust? How do you know? By how they appear? 'What they do?' We've just had activity on Monica Chatwin's phone. The closest we can place it is Ephra Stein's holiday home. Put the gun down! Claim it. We've just had a claim posted on the internet for the assassination of both Nessa Stein and Ephra Stein. League of Samaria. Israelis! His name's Enad Geffen. He's Israeli. Oh, he's not Israeli.

 He's Palestinian? Monica Chatwin is working for the Palestinians. Why is she doing that? She's up again. Washington, Exeter Road, Moorland Lane. Kate Larsson, special advisor... To the Secretary of State. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 'If what looks to have happened actually has, 'you can expect a very strong response from this department. 'And from the Secretary of State herself? 'Yes. She has agreed.' 'So when you think about it like that...' 'Yes. She has agreed.' '..it's a wonder we trust anyone at all.'

 It's the Secretary of State. She's the one who's agreed. To what? I don't know. But I think Samir Meshal was a go-between for the Palestinians and the US. This is a grab of him meeting Kate Larsson in his hotel lobby two days before he died. 25 minutes later, he'd made his fatal mistake - a phone call into the Palestinian territories. And when he said, "She has agreed," the Americans heard him say it. And, because they were secretly piggybacking on an Israeli wiretap, they knew the Israelis had heard it, too. So they had to take him out before the Israelis could get to him and find out what it was she'd agreed to. The murder of Nessa Stein? Maybe, but I don't think so. Come on, this is realpolitik. Whatever it is, it has to make the US look good. Nessa Stein's murder... actually, I think it's Monica Chatwin who's holding the sticky end of that. But she's only doing it to give the US the chance to step forward and do something "incredible". Huh! There was me thinking she's gunning for my job, when, all along, she just wants yours. Ouch. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru. Modeh Anee Lefanecha. Don't be afraid. I'm safe. I can't do this. If it's the price... for a nation. Ladies and gentlemen, the Secretary of State. 'Good morning. 'As many of you are aware, 'we have had to draw the tragic conclusion that, two days ago, 'Nessa Stein, 'an unending campaigner for reconciliation in the Middle East, 'was killed by a terrorist outrage perpetrated by a group functioning, 'apparently unencumbered, within the State of Israel. 'As the shock waves continue across the region and the world, 'this administration has decided 'that it cannot let this appalling act go unanswered. 'Throughout the length of Israel's existence, 'America has stood full square beside her. 'Our belief and loyalty cannot be called into question 'and we do not bring it into question here today. 'However, as a sister might her sibling, 'there can come a time 'when the conduct of one must be called into question by the other. 'This is such a time. 'Nessa Stein was not a politician, she was a businesswoman - 'a businesswoman who recognised with pragmatic, economic conviction 'that a balance needs to be brought between Israel and Palestine. 'It was a bold and charismatic stance in a region that has become 'mired in stalemate and distrust, and for which, tragically, 'she paid with her life. 'I am not a businesswoman, I am a politician. 'And a politician recognises that a state without a cohesive identity 'is a state that cannot function - 'a state that will fail - 'and a failed state is a danger to the world. 'A balance needs to be brought to bear 'and not only one that is economic, 'to which Nessa Stein's life must surely attest, 'but one that is also political... 'to which cause this administration has decided 'to take a bold and certain stance. 'Should the Palestinian Authority 'resubmit its application to the UN for full state recognition, 'it is the intent of this administration 'not to exercise its veto. 'We, the American people, 'will not stand in the way of Palestine's quest for statehood. 'Thank you.' 'No questions.' Wow! You had that planned all along? I heard it might be coming. I hear you want my job. I'll take Hoyle's to start with. I wouldn't push him. I thought you were going to do that for me. Today's a different world. A better one. Worth the life of Nessa Stein? Stop! I believed in Nessa Stein. I believed in what she stood for. And I believe that, today, what she stood for has come to pass. Thanks to her. She made it happen. With a little help from you. Actually, she ignored any of my advice. Oh, well... that is certainly very sad. Cos if she could smell a rat in you, she certainly was someone to believe in. What's this? Should I know? Should I start talking to IA? I don't believe we have an IA in the Secret Service... We will after this. What is all this, HH? Claw marks on your desk top? It's not worth it, just stand up and walk away. Don't touch my wife. Ex-wife. And from what I understand, someone else is touching her already. See? Even that's over. It's all over. So say goodbye to the view, Hugh. 'You have one new message.' 'Shlomo... 'It's me. 'It's Nessa. 'I'm alive.' 'Please leave a message after the tone.' No, no. Shlomo... ..it's me. It's Nessa. I'm alive. It's all right. It's a pay-as-you-go located in the H1 area of Hebron. That's Palestinian responsibility - your responsibility. We've checked. She's not there. Well, of course not. She will have been moved. We don't think so. We think this is an Israeli ploy to discredit the brave stand America has taken against them. Nessa Stein is dead. A martyr to our cause. You want us to go in and get her out? I'm surprised we're even having this conversation. Really? Even if she is alive, we find out where she is, we go in and then she dies. Think about that - then we really will have killed Nessa Stein. This is your chance to save her - to save your face. We can't take that risk. I think you're going to have to. You're not listening to me. We can't take that risk. WE cannot. But we can. We would not stand in your way. Oh, and remember, the airspace above the Palestinian territories, it is Israeli. Hm. When you hear that, it makes you think, doesn't it? There is no way that I'm suggesting UK boots on Palestinian soil. You won't have to. The one person I think could get her out belongs there already. What do you think's going to happen, Atika? I don't know. Take a guess. You see, right now, I think your group's confused, otherwise they would've killed her already. So this is our one opportunity. But I'm sure it's... very narrow. I understand. What do you understand? You believe in a cause. Actually, I rather admire it. One you can give your whole life to... ..kill for... ..and die. Because he was... You know, he would've killed you - one of your own. His name was Enad Geffen, he was an Israeli. Yeah, yeah, we've been through all that. Atika, you're as much of a pawn in this as Nessa Stein. But then I can even understand you justifying in your mind why he would do that. As long as it's for the cause. Anything for the cause. And what is that? Palestinian statehood? And here we are, this close to your goal. Nothing must stop it from happening. Nothing. And that is why you have to help us get Nessa Stein out. Because if the world finds out that she wasn't killed by that bomb but by your own people, while she was incarcerated God knows where... ..imagine what that's going to do. Imagine how far back that will set your cause. Maybe they know. Maybe that's why she's still alive. Maybe they let her go. Maybe. Maybe. It's just that we also have another problem. You have the problem. We. There's a wiretap listening to everything that comes out of the territories. Ha! The Jews. And someone else. Someone who will also have heard that call and who now knows that she's still alive. And these people, they've worked very hard to see her dead and, now the world thinks she is, they'll want her to stay that way. So let them. Except that we know she's not, Atika. So I'm giving you this chance to go back in there and explain exactly what it would mean for your cause, for your people... ..if Nessa Stein doesn't come out of Palestine alive. Chatwin still thinks you're free. But you'd better hurry... ..cos we ain't got long. I didn't know what that man would do to you. I tried to stop him. But I did know they would take you in Gaza. And you knew they'd taken Kasim. Yes. All we did was return him to his family. And, after all, you had not claimed him for yourself. You claimed him for me. You let me, Nessa. Where is he now? Here. He's in no danger. He never was. Oh, Atika... Why? Just talk to me. When I was 12... ..I lost all my family. All my family. Your family. Take it! No, no, no, no. Keep it with you. I tried. You tried? With what? With what, Nessa? Cables? We need a nation. I always thought I had. Have you seen the hills? What they're building? Every day and every day? What you try don't change anything for my people. We need so much more. What else can I do? Do you need me to die? Me? Oh, no. No. But if it's the price... for a nation... ..I'm sorry to tell you, yes. But you survived. You're here now. And now we have to save you. For exactly the same reason. Do you know who I am? I am Kasim's grandfather. My son raped you. On my orders. Mine. One of my soldiers, also... ..he killed your father. On my orders. What I have ordered goes beyond all imagining. So I must ask you... if there was a knife on the table between us here... ..what would you do? Your brother... ..is dead. My orders. The hatred you feel for me right now... ..only matches what I have felt for your people... ..all my life. I know you won't take it... ..because you think you are better than me. More cultured, more sophisticated. More human. And I hate you all the more... ..because you have never stopped to think why that is. No, I have. I have. And I know the answer. And I've known it since I first asked... ..and after every dreadful thing that's happened since... ..and the answer's always the same. I deserve it. All of it. No matter what I do. Then I can let you go. When? Now. I want my boy. No, he stays. I want him. He has a mother already. You gave him to her. I want him back. Too late. Live with it. I'll come back for him. I don't think so. I do. Ah! Oh! This is Dagon. Yes? You must take the child. 'Why?' He's a witness. You must take him, too. OK. 'Tell me where to go.' She is already on her way. Tell your person to wait. I will bring the boy. Then you'd better put your foot on it. It's all right, baby, it's me. Ma'am? I'm from the American embassy, my name is Robert Hardy. Nessa Stein? Miss Stein? I'm here to take you out. Please. Ma'am? You have to help me! Ma'am... That's what I'm here for, ma'am. There's a child... I know. ..and we have to go back for him. It's all right, they're bringing him to us. What? They're bringing him here. How do you know that? I've just been called. It's Kasim, right? Yes. Yes. All we have to do is wait. Don't worry, Miss Stein... ...he's on his way. You're safe now. OK? You're safe. It's me. Tell us where to be. They're on stand-by. One hour. Don't worry. Everything will be well. Hold on. OK, are you all right? Yeah. Yeah? Darling... there is a game I want you to do. And I need you to listen very carefully. OK? But first, you must know that I love you... ..very much. Where are they? We should go and meet them halfway. It's best we stay put. They know where we are. Don't worry, they'll be here. The whole world thinks you're dead. Did you know that? Where are we? About to link up with Waddington. And we're on. There! Right there. See? Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Yes! Pass me the phone. Yes? We have you. So... you're going to keep your eyes tight shut, huh? Just like I said, that's the game. Tight shut. Can you do that for me? OK, that's my boy. OK. Come with me. Miss Stein, can you wait with me, please? Miss Stein, can you wait with me, please?! Miss Stein! What's happening, sir? I don't know. Eyes shut, eyes tight shut. Kasim! Kasim, oh... Oh! You're safe! Ugh! He was going to kill you both. Back in the car. Back in the car now! We don't have time. Come on. Fuck! Trust me! Back in the car! Hayden-Hoyle sent me, OK? You trust him? So now back in the car. Where are you going to take us? To the Israeli border. We don't have time. Come on. Now! Pick up the phone! Why are his eyes closed? I told him. It's over, he's down. We're heading for the Israeli border. Keep this line open. You can open your eyes. Hello. Hi. Are you hurt? Are you saving us, Atika? Remember that, huh? Remember that. He's all right? OK. We've lost vision. Speak to me, Atika. Send tone down the line. Shitty fucking car! OK, you try. And if it starts and I'm not back, you go. No! Yes, you go. Please? Don't let him see. Keep your eyes closed. OK. Keep them closed. You go! OK. Where is he? We can't see. Go. Go! They're leaving her behind. Ah! Jesus! On me, now! On her. Get off my land. Target struck and destroyed, 15.56 GMT. Come on out. Come on out! All right... Are you OK? Sorry. I think we're going to have to walk. Has it gone? Are you all right? Yeah. OK. Back up a bit. Can you see those birds up there? You see them? Look. There. Here. Look! Looks like we've found it! Oh... OK! It's all right, it's all right. Who are you? My name is Nessa Stein. This is my son. It's all right. Sh, sh, sh! It's OK. It's OK. So... time for a tidy-up, wouldn't you say? Before we all get back to that "see no monkey" business. And, by the way, whatever that involves, it does not involve Hayden-Hoyle, OK? I think we can both agree that he's more than earned his retirement. How come it all came down to you? Well, I don't know, Harlan. Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that, in a room full of pussies... ..I'm the only one with a vagina. 'Although confusion still surrounds 'Stein's remarkable reappearance 'from an assassination attempt that killed 75 people last week, 'including Ephra Stein - Baroness Stein's elder brother, 'reaction to her survival in the region has been swift 'with both Israel and Palestine welcoming the news. 'Strained relations between Israel and the United States 'look set to continue, however, 'with the spokesman for the Secretary of State, Tippi Hagan, 'confirming the US's intention 'not to veto any future resolution on Palestinian statehood, 'insisting that it remains a priority for the administration. 'Lindsay Latham has this. 'Dick, Daniel Betheridge, State Department's new spokesman, 'cited Abraham Lincoln today in his response 'to the Lazarus-like survival 'of English Baroness, Nessa Stein, 'quoting the 16th President's famous adage 'that though a man may walk slowly, he should never walk backwards. 'He confirmed the Government remained committed to the removal of 'its UN veto from any Palestinian attempt for state recognition. 'However, in the light of this pre-emptive move, 'both Russia and China have indicated that, 'should it come to a final vote, 'they may now reconsider their previous record 'and veto the US plan. 'This, coupled with Stein's spectacular re-emergence, 'forced Betheridge to concede 'that the region's already volatile political landscape 'is set once again to undergo yet more tumultuous upheaval. 'Dick. 'Lindsay, makes you wonder why they bother.' Housekeeping. Sorry, I'm sorry, so sorry. See, I'd die for you. I hear you've retired. Yep. No car. So I'm having to get used to just using my legs. Looks like you need a little practice. If I end up in a wheelchair, will you come and push me? I'll think about it. Then I'll be breaking them both this evening. So what are you going to do next? Apart from buying a hammer? Apart from that. Oh, I'm up for a university chancellorship. Where? Oxford, St Peter's. Lovely flat. Views over the quad. Just the perfect weekend retreat for the high-flying female executive. Oxford, that's not an appointment, is it? You have to get yourself elected. Yep, I'm finally going to stand up and be counted. Actually, I think it's between me and a guy who owns a chip shop on the high street. Seriously? I'll never lie to you, Anji. Never again. Ah, well. Democracy... Good luck with that! Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
