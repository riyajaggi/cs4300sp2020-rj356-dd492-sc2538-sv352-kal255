 Who do you trust?
 Samir Meshal. He's dead.
 A suicide.
 How do you know?
 The Israeli Government has, er...
had no hand in this.
 Nessa Stein.
 Not quite the woman she appears to be.
 By how they appear?
 Kasim!
 What they do?
 Seven years ago,
The Stein Group launched its first phase
 of the telecommunications roll-out
into the Palestinian territories.
 How come it was Ephra Stein
that launched it and not his sister?
 Lay the cable. And when they're down,
 there's something else we want you to do.
 How come he was in the lead back then,
 but now their roles are reversed?
 If it gets your sister out, you'll have
to step down as head of the company
 and then you have to put Nessa
in your place.
 What does she want Nessa Stein to achieve?
 Equality of opportunity
between Palestine and Israel.
 Jalal El-Amin.
To what do I owe this honour?
 Your third-phase cabling contract
into the West Bank.
 We're now in a position to bid for this.
 Your sister's kidnapping,
the child's kidnapping, your academy.
 I think it's all connected.
 It's a wiretap, Mr Zahary.
 You asked me to trust you.
 And you should, you should!
 Not this time.
 For Christ's sakes, Nessa.
 One thread to pull it all together.
And all I have to do is find it.
 So, when you think about it like that...
 Nessa Stein's leaving her house.
 Alone.
 ...it's a wonder we trust anyone at all.
 Do you have a bed at least?
 Not for you.
 OK, I'm used to a sofa.
 How about the floor?
 You might have to warm me up a bit first.
 Maybe I want you cold.
 Now I want you to try and get out.
 I don't know if I want to play this game.
 Who said it was a game?
 I know you.
I knew you the minute I first saw you.
 OK.
 So how do you think you're gonna look
on TV after I've broken your nose?
 Don't break my nose.
 Not a good look for all those good deeds?
 I said the fucking floor.
 I bet you've been doing this for years,
haven't you?
 And you've always got away with it...
 ...because people didn't know
who you were.
 But now they do...
 ...and you didn't think about that,
did you?
 Big, clever girl.
 Still, I bet it won't happen again,
will it?
 So I'd better make the most of it.
 Let me go.
 Baroness Stein...
 Let me go.
 No!
 Modeh ani I'faneykha.
 Don't be afraid.
 I'm safe.
 I can't do this.
 If it's the price...for a nation.
 Hello?
 Nessa Stein?
 Er, my...my name's Max Boorman,
we need to get you to hospital.
 Go away.
 You need help.
 I know who you work for. Go away.
 You need help.
 You think
 We need to get you to a hospital.
 No hospitals.
 No, no, no, no. Somewhere private.
 I can take you somewhere private.
 Ah, so what, they'll sell the story
to The Telegraph instead of The Sun?
 No-one's selling any stories.
 Why? Are they bound by
the Official Secrets Act?
 Er, something like that.
 It owns them?
 And not a damn thing they can do about it.
 Baroness Stein.
 Fuck's sake.
 His name's Tom Crace.
 He's an accountant
with two HMRC investigations pending.
 Married 11 years, two children,
youngest 2, a girl, Melanie.
 The flat he attacked you in
belongs to his company.
 There's a culture of
casual sex and blind eyes.
 But not for rape...
 ...that's off books -
 even for a bent accountant.
 He's tidying up now.
A blood sample's been taken.
 He says he's not got HIV or Heps
or anything.
 You arrested him?
 Do you want us to?
 No.
 Sure?
 So, you'll be given a number to call
in 48hrs
 for the full plethora of results.
 You need to give me a code word.
 Fucking idiot.
 Atika.
 A-T-I-K...
 Doesn't matter - you just have to say it
when you phone.
 ...A-T-I-K-A.
 OK.
 Let's get you home.
 I know what happened...
 ...in Gaza...
 ...to you and Atika.
 Can I ask you a question?
 You're going to anyway, so just do it.
 What happened tonight,
has it happened before?
 Did it happen then?
 What's it say in my file?
 It doesn't.
 Why do you need to know?
 I want to help.
 You want to help me, or you?
 Both of us.
 All you spies need to coordinate better.
 Coordinate with who?
 With your colleague - Monica Chatwin.
 I wouldn't say she's a colleague.
 More a competitor.
 So she wants your job.
 Unless, maybe,
 you help me out a little.
 Why would I want to do that?
 Oh, my God!
 I was hit by a car.
 Deliberately?
 What?
 Who hit you?
 Frances, aren't you supposed to be
in Tel Aviv?
 There's something
you need to see.
 What?
 OK.
 Thank you.
 It's been claimed.
 Who by?
 Samarian Defence League.
 Yaniv Levi.
 You've heard of him.
 Horrible...
 ...horrible Israeli terrorist.
 Mm, he's a very bad boy.
 Why did they kill him?
 Pro-Palestinian statements to the press
intent on exposing Israeli corruption.
 Our institution's not corrupt.
 Except that's not what he found, is it?
 But it isn't.
 Who told you that?
 Your brother?
 Because he runs that side of things now,
doesn't he?
 Has done for, what, seven years?
 And do you trust him?
 He's my brother.
 That's not what I asked.
 Yes, it is.
 So you think, if he'd been targeted
covertly by the Israeli military,
 he'd have had the strength
to stand up to them.
 All on his own.
 He's not on his own.
 Mmm... He's got me.
 Couldn't that be the problem?
 What if he wishes he was?
 What if he wanted to feel
he was in control of things again,
 like he used to be -
before his little sister took his job?
 He didn't want it.
 And why was that?
 Are you trying to help?
 Oh, yeah, I really am.
 Doesn't feel like it.
 Feels like you're trying to put a split
right in the heart of this business.
 Unless it's already there.
 Oh, I need to rest.
 What about the press?
 I'll do it.
 Looking like that?
 Give it to your brother.
 Although be careful,
 that's a lot of pressure.
 Sure he can take it?
 What are you trying to prove?
 My point. But you don't have to answer.
 I'll just wait until
 I see who you decide to put
in front of the camera.
 - Kasim's kidnappers...
- What?
 You don't think this is connected?
 Do you?
 When it comes to Israel and Palestine -
isn't everything?
 Thank you for taking me home.
 Obviously, this tragic event
is of huge concern
 to the Stein Foundation
and to the Kidma Academy.
 But at this point,
I am sure you'll understand,
 it is not appropriate
for us to make any comment
 on anything until the facts of
this situation are completely understood.
 Except, of course, for us to reiterate
our heartfelt condolences
 to Shimon Ben-Reuven's family -
 the private expressions of which,
I'm sure you will agree,
 should remain just that.
 Was he murdered?
 Your person is making
a statement to the press?
 Yes.
 Denouncing
these terrible things, I'm sure.
 What happened
was undeniably a tragedy.
 We're not yet in a position
to pinpoint exactly the cause.
 Your academy was in cahoots with the IDF.
 We can't say that for sure.
 I can reassure you, without a doubt,
that if we discover anything
 to support that claim, I will condemn
the academy without reservation.
 If you discover? Isn't that
exactly what this teacher's done?
 What else got him killed?
 It appears to be because of
the comments that he made to the press.
 We don't know yet
if what he said was true.
 Yaniv Levi is an Israeli attack dog...
 ...and they just let him off the leash.
 We don't know that. Not yet.
 I know it. Someone had to pay him.
 I'm not sure he's a gun for hire.
 He always has a price,
of course he does, what Jew doesn't?
 The contract you're bidding for.
 For obvious reasons,
 the companies we work with
need to be scrupulously neutral.
 A comment like the one you just made
could devastate our activities.
 Which brings me to the background check
 I've had drawn up on your company.
 It doesn't exactly make for
an even-handed read, does it?
 Doesn't matter.
 Well, it matters to me.
 It doesn't matter what I say
or what you read there.
 You're going to give me the contract.
 No, Jalal El-Amin, I'm not.
 Yes, you are.
 Because then your secret will be safe.
 Mm...
 Why have you taken so long?
 We didn't expect to have to do this.
 To take a child.
 Replace Samir Meshal.
 And what is he supposed to do?
 We need a Palestinian
standing by your side.
 Looking over my shoulder.
 Yes.
 Why?
 Because we have to be certain.
 Of what?
 That you are everything you say.
 Mr Zahary.
 Looks like we're flying out together.
 How did you find that out?
 Luck! Lady Luck!
She's been chasing me all my life...
 brazen hussy!
 My daughter.
 Would you please be so kind as to offer me
one of your pomegranate shakes?
 No ice, please, and a straw.
 It's good for the grey cells, pomegranate,
stops you going ga-ga.
 We shouldn't be talking, Mr Zahary.
 Oh, the fuck?
 I once got caught in SÃ£o Paulo in fog.
 For six whole hours,
I did nothing but talk to Nazis.
 Thank you, darling.
 You see, people think I'm very stupid...
 I'm sure they don't.
 Oh, no, no, they do, they do -
on the technical side of things,
 they think I don't know my Tier IIIs
from my PSTNs
 to my PABXs...and, let's face it,
it is fucking boring.
 But I'm going to let you in
on a secret now.
 I do know.
 Everything.
 But I don't allow them to know that I know
 because then I can look at them
without them knowing that I really do.
 You follow me?
 I think so.
 OK, so let me say this in plain English
so we don't have to
 speak in capital letters,
even though now you know that I can.
 That sniffer you've found,
is it still up and running?
 Yes.
 So whoever's listening doesn't know
that you've found it.
 Correct.
 Good.
 So what that device does is
it duplicates all the information
 that goes along the mother line
 and then this material is re-routed
back into the system
 until, eventually, it reaches the decoders
of whoever's listening.
 Am I right?
 You're right.
 See?
 So, do you know why I'm a billionaire?
 Cos everything, every single thing
on a telecommunications network,
 is monetarised.
 Every little bit of traffic that uses
a line is paid for by someone, somewhere.
 And in order for that to be done,
 every single one of those lines
has to have a number.
 Now, do you know who does
the itemised billing
 for all those millions of numbers?
 My company.
 So if you look into that sniffer,
 you'll find the lines
and the numbers that it uses.
 And then,
if you give those numbers to me...
 ...I can find out who is paying the bill.
 Does that make sense to you?
 Ugh, truly, that is disgusting!
 Am I safe?
 I have a family, three children.
 I am engineer,
I understand there are risks,
 particularly working where I do.
 But this...
 Am I safe, Baroness Stein?
 From whom?
 From you.
 Daddy used to play on this as a boy,
so be very careful...
 ...and, er, you know,
watch where you're putting your feet.
 Nessa! The woman in black!
Are you all right?
 Oh, Ephra...
 What?
 You've ruined us!
 Go inside! Girls!
 Did you let them put that listening thing
on our lines?
 Let them set up a secret department
to decode in our university?!
 I had no choice!
 Oh, no, because this secret owns you,
does it?!
 That's what it cost to get you out!
I got you out!
 You're blaming me?
 No, you're the one who went to Gaza.
 I went to Gaza because other people
were sending money there first.
 Yeah, and I got him out, too.
 Who?
 The soldier.
 No-one was gonna help him Nessa, no-one!
 And no-one was gonna help you either.
 That makes you the big man, does it
 You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me!
 With what, Ephra, with what?
 You turned me into a puppet...
 and you never said a word.
 You've got secrets of your own, Nessa.
Nothing to do with me.
 I wouldn't have been there
if it weren't for you!
 Wanna know why they've taken the boy?
 Because the Palestinians
were suspicious
 that this is what you and the Israelis
were up to all along
 Oh, my God, it's true.
 You're blaming me for Kasim's kidnap?
 No! They wanted Samir Meshal close enough
to watch over us.
 And so now they've got someone else.
 Who?
 Who do you think?
 Oh, El-Amin...
 And you wanna know what my choice is?
 I haven't got one.
 Cos every fucking road on this
leads back to you!
 And I'm sorry. But I just wanted...
 - What?
- Help...help...help...
 What did you want?
You wanted to be Papa?
 - No!
- The great Eli Stein?
 Please...
 Look at you!
You couldn't even be my brother.
 You know what I think?
 All this big "World Stage Reconciliation"
stuff - why don't you just take
 a good hard look at yourself first?
 - Did you get that from your therapist?
- Well, tell me it isn't true, huh?
 What would you do if you met the man
who ordered Papa's death?
 Would you just give him a big hug, Nessa?
 I certainly wouldn't stick a knife
in his neck.
 - Wouldn't you?
- Would you?
 Yes, I would!
 Well, then, whatever happens from now on,
you're no longer a part of it.
 Nessa...
 Fine, fine, get rid of me, then!
Get rid of everyone!
 But when you're standing there
all on your own, ask yourself this -
 was it them, or is it me?
 We have absolutely no knowledge
 of the group operating
within your university.
 None.
 Do you know there are moments
in a diplomat's career, Daniel,
 when the only thing to do
is just to tell it straight.
 We have absolutely no knowledge
 - of the group...
- Is it also your policy
 to allow military veterans
into universities
 at the expense of Israeli Arabs?
 We have absolutely no...
 Could you fucking shut up?
 Is that how it is, to tell it straight?
 No.
 This is how it is.
 I've been set up as some kind of a front,
haven't I,
 seven years ago,
by your government and my brother
 and you've both colluded to make sure
that I never found out?
 - We have absol...
- I haven't finished!
 Now that I have found out,
this is what you're going to do about it.
 One - your government
will continue to support
 the Stein Group in all its activities.
 From now on, there will be
no preferment policy in any institution
 to which my name is attached.
 Two - as we speak, our entire
cable network is being swept
 and that will continue
with your government's full support.
 Three - if, for whatever reason,
this happens in the future,
 it doesn't matter what you do
or what you say,
 you will be doing it in public -
because that's the stage I'll be on.
 And believe me,
I'm very good on a public stage.
 Now you can speak.
 Your claim would damage you more than us,
no matter what.
 You wanna put that to the test?
 Because, believe me,
I've got nothing else to lose.
 Your points have been noted, Miss Stein.
 Not that it matters, but I am a baroness.
 I was made one for my public efforts
in international reconciliation.
 My marriage status
really doesn't come into it.
 One last thing. Whoever I choose
as partner for the next phase
 of this project, you will support.
 Who have you chosen?
 Because of the recent, tragic loss
of Samir Meshal,
 the Stein Group has had to re-launch
our search
 for a partner in the Phase Three roll-out
of fibre-optic broadband
 into the Palestinian territories.
 After an extensive process,
I am delighted to announce
 that Jalal El-Amin and Tahet Technology
has won the contract
 to share in the next stage
of this exciting journey.

 have won the contract

 Whatever it is you think
you're going to find, you won't.
 It's gone. So's my brother.
 Good.
 So give the boy back.
 Soon.
 When?
 Go to Hebron. Open Phase Three.
 Do that and all will be well. Trust me.
 All you have to do is shake my hand.
 OK. Same to you.
 That was Monica Chatwin
 calling to congratulate me
on my brave choice of partner.
 Well, maybe
she should be advising you, then,
 because you're certainly not listening
to me.
 It took your analyst, what,
 three strokes of a keyboard to link
the El-Amin family to the PLO?
 PLO run the Authority now.
 You know what I mean.
 Where are we?
 A sniffer on all international traffic
in and out of the territories.
 Are you sure the Israelis put it there?
 Well, they'll deny it anyway.
 And the Palestinians
had suspicions of their own
 so they decided to get a man in
on the inside of the Stein Group.
 Night before he left Washington,
 Samir Meshal made a call
into the Palestinian Territories.
 It lasted four seconds
and whatever he said...
 ...someone heard.
 And that got him killed.
 Now, with him, his people had all the time
they needed to discredit me
 and put him in with Nessa.
 But after they lost him,
the new fucker... What's his name?
 ...El-Amin, they had to be more blunt.
 And take the child.
 Is my guess.
 Which is why
she agreed to make him a partner. -
 to get the boy back.
 Yeah...
 All this for a housekeeper's kid?!
 In a child's eyes, the world entire.
 I wouldn't know, I don't have one.
 This doesn't add up.
 If the Palestinians
were suspicious of the Steins,
 why didn't they just say it out loud?
 Maybe they want proof.
 They're not going to get that. Not now.
 Whatever it is they want,
 they want it with Nessa Stein
staying exactly where she is.
 Why?
 Come on, everyone, say hello!
 - Bonjour.
- Ni hua.
 ..we've just had this watch come in.
 We wanted to...
 ...mature conifer plantations, preferring
a location with access to water.
 Cemeteries, gardens, and parks
 have allowed it to spread into urban....
 Tariq!
 Tariq! Tariq!
 Come on.
 You like it?
 You want one for yourself?
 You know what you've got to do to get one?
 You've got to believe in something.
 Believe in it so much...
 ...you will do anything...
 ...anything to make it happen.
 Yeah?
 That's me.
 This is what it costs.
 You want touch it?
 I didn't want it.
 I didn't want any of it.
 But those were my orders
and I am a soldier and...
 a soldier has no choice.
 No.
 Do you think you can do that?
 Yeah... Very good. Give it to me.
 I have a boy your age.
 I hope he is brave too.
 Just like you.
 Just before he left America,
and the day before he died,
 Samir Meshal made a telephone call
into the Palestinian territories.
 Which your lot hear.
 So, what did he say
that meant you had to go and kill him?
 We didn't kill him.
 You've probably heard the rumour
that I only got this job
 because I slept with my boss.
 No, I hadn't.
 Oh, well, it's true, I did.
 It cost me my marriage.
 Well, what really cost me
 was because actually my wife
didn't think I stood for anything.
 And the joke was, of course...
 ...I didn't have to
because all I had to do was...
 ...lie down for it.
 Anyway, I'm a biddable night-watchman,
that's me.
 And I know pretty soon
someone's going to bowl me a googly
 and I'll be out.
 It's cricket. It's a cricket analogy.
 I don't know why I said it,
I don't even play the game.
 But when that happens...
 ...when it's all over...
 ...I just want to be able to walk
towards the pavilion thing,
 you know...
 ...with my head held high.
 Just for once.
 I'd really like to do that, Judah.
 I really would.
 If that makes any sense.
 We didn't kill Samir Meshal.
 OK.
 Someone else did.
 We had heard something
and we did want to pick him up.
 - But, er, we didn't get the chance.
- Because somebody else got there first.
 - Yes.
- Who?
 - Whoever else was listening.
- How would they do that?
 We don't know.
 What did you hear him say?
 "She...has...agreed."
 That's it?
 That's it.
 Who's she?
 What did she agree to?
 That's why I'm telling you.
 But someone knows and, whoever it is,
 they killed Samir Meshal.
 Delicious!
 So there is this service line.
 It's used for software updates,
maintenance, that sort of thing.
 It's also another way in
for someone to listen.
 Piggy-backing onto the same device?
 Seems so.
 Who?
 Well, you think I would have waited
this long if I had that news?
 There's no number attached to it
so we can't tell where it goes,
 and it doesn't come back for billing.
 So all we can say is
that it goes through us, and then...
 On its own sweet way.
 Is it still live?
 Good.
 Then let's switch it off.
 No, you do that,
the whole thing goes kaput.
 No, no, no...
 Like it's a technical fault,
completely innocent.
 Then all we have to do is
wait and see who comes to fix it.
 Shouldn't take him a minute.
 They're back on.
 Let me know where they end up.
 We'll get something new, I know we will.
 And this time it won't be
for anyone else -
 not your father, your sister.
 It'll just be for you.
 And me.
 And the girls.
 You're a wonderful father, Ephra.
 Don't let them see you like this.
 I'm stuck in a loop, aren't I?
 Playing Neil Diamond records?
 Thinking about it.
 Then, yes, you are.
 I can change.
 Would that involve black denim?
 - It could if you wanted it to.
- I don't.
 Then it won't...
 Do you spy on me?
 I mean, not like that...
 I mean like this.
 What a question?!
 I've just texted you
the address of a restaurant.
 Thursday, 8pm.
 It'll be a window seat.
 Great.
 For you to spy on.
 There's something I want you to see.
 You'd better come and look at this.
 Tell me it's not that fucking easy!
 America.
 May I say you look particularly fetching
in that shade of blue?
 The Americans killed Samir Meshal.
 I thought we'd agreed to look away
from that particular direction.
 I did. I looked so far the other way
I seem to have come round full circle.
 I trust you don't need me to translate.
 If only my arsehole were big enough.
 Who did you get that from?
 Really?
 Who has agreed to what?
 Ah, well, no, that bit I really can't tell
because I simply don't know.
 Don't go growing a pair of balls on me,
Hugh, not at this late stage,
 I might get jealous.
 Do you think maybe
that's why my hair's falling out?
 I think what you're doing now could have
a serious effect on your health.
 As long as I have your support, Julia,
I'm happy to live dangerously.
 I do have your support...
 ...don't I?
 Stay away from the Americans, Hugh.
 Seriously.
 Got a nice little Ivy League
chancellorship hiding up your sleeve?
 I have a strange concern
for a long-term colleague
 with whom I once used to sleep.
 Now, that is a surprise.
 Something will happen.
 I'm sure it will.
 Soon.
 But if it was me...
 ...well...
 you know what it would be like
if it was me.
 There's something you should know.
 How many other lies are you going to keep
 - in this house?
- She shouldn't have told you.
 And that's supposed to make me feel what?
 - I only just found out myself.
- And you didn't tell me!
 It wasn't mine to say!
 Your own wife!
 Which secret is the one
you don't tell your own wife?
 I have no secrets from you.
 I tell you everything.
 If your sister swore you to secrecy,
you'd keep it, I know you would.
 - The child belongs to her.
- Yes.
 I wouldn't keep that secret, not that one.
 Not when our whole life's been turned
inside out because of it!
 And why did she agree to it?
 I don't know, Rachel! I don't know!
 What those two have been through,
we can't even begin to understand, can we?
 I do, when it's wrecking my marriage.
 It's not.
 I said I'd support you,
but what does that mean?
 You lied to your sister.
 You lied about your business.
 You've lied about the Academy,
you've lied to everyone. Ephra...
 And now you've lied to me.
 I'm the one who got them out, Rachel!
 Me! I got them out!
 If I hadn't, they'd have died!
 Do you understand that?
They would have died!
 And there's nothing that you
or anybody else could have done about it.
 Except I did. I did!
 And all this, all this shit...
 this is what it cost me!
 You shouldn't have lied to me.
 Not under my own roof.
 Have I caught you at a bad time?
 What do you want?
 What, no vampire comparisons?
 Just...get on with it.
 OK.
 I know what you did.
 To get your sister out of Gaza,
 the Israelis nailed you
for a sniffer on your cables
 and a listening unit within your Academy.
 That's quite a price to pay.
 It was worth it.
 That must be hard...
 ...to be a hero that nobody thanks.
 Tell that to my wife.
 Yes, well,
not many people will understand.
 But you do.
 Nothing I've done...
 I can ever say...
 it was worth it.
 But I'd like to.
 Even now.
 What is it that you want?
 Who else did you tell?
 About the wiretap?
 One of yours.
 Who?
 Monica...
 - Chatwin.
- Chatwin.
 Tariq! Tariq!
 - Tariq!
 Tariq!
 - OK, OK, OK.
 Tariq!
 Hey, where are you going, eh?
 - No, no, no.
 You cannot tell them about me,
you have to say the gun was yours, OK?
 You kept it loaded!
 The gun is yours.
 OK?
 OK, uh?
 Say it, OK?
 Call the ambulance when I'm gone.
 Your boy is strong.
 He will survive.
 But I was never here.
 I need help.
