 The Honourable Woman (2014): Season 1, Episode 7 - The Hollow Wall - full transcript 
 Nessa's rapist Palestinian Al-Zahid arrives in London for a meeting with Monica Chatwin, intercepted by Hayden-Hoyle, who assumes Monica is working with the Palestinians and also tells Nessa he knows why Kasim was taken. Nessa goes to Hebron on the West Bank to unveil the cable system but Frances is angry with her for signing over its rights to El-Amin, unaware of her reasons. There is an assassination attempt, which Nessa survives and about which El-Amin does not seem wholly innocent but she is missing though the news reports claim she is dead. Atika lures Ephra to his death. Ephra is killed by Al-Zahid, who is then killed by Ephra's wife. Israeli extremist group the League of Samaria claim to have killed both Steins but their leader Yaniv Levi is also found dead. Suspicious of Monica Chatwin's true allegiance Hayden-Hoyle plays a tape regarding American involvement in Israel, noting a comment made about the Secretary of State - "She has agreed."

 Who do you trust?
 How do you know?
 - You need help.
- If you think.
 Has it happened before?
Did it happen then?
 By how they appear?
 What they do?
 To get your sister out of Gaza,
 the Israelis nailed you
for a sniffer on your cables
 and a listening unit within your academy.
 That's quite a price to pay.
 It was worth it.
 You're going to give me the contract
because then your secret will be safe.
 You wanna know what my choice is?
 I haven't got one.
 Because every fucking road on this
leads back to you.
 There's something you should know.
 How many other lies
are you going to keep in this house?
 I'm the one who got them out, Rachel. Me!
 I got them out!
 This is what it cost me.
 You shouldn't have lied to me.
 Whatever it is you think
you're going to find, you won't.
 It's gone. So's my brother.
 - Good.
- So give the boy back.
 Go to Hebron. Shake my hand.
All will be well.
 Night before he left Washington,
 Samir Meshal made a call
into the Palestinian territories.
 Someone heard.
 What did you hear him say?
 "She...has...agreed."
 Who's "she"?
 What did she agree to?
 That's why I'm telling you.
 That someone knows. And whoever it is...
 they killed Samir Meshal.
 Who else did you tell?
 - About the wiretap?
- Monica...
 ...Chatwin.
 Let's not forget the long ball here,
Julia.
 Isn't that an Americanism?
 It's what it's always been
and what we all want -
 peace in the Middle East.
 You'd better come and look at this.
 Tell me it's not that fucking easy.
 The Americans killed Samir Meshal.
 Who has agreed to what?
 I simply don't know.
 Stay away from the Americans, Hugh.
 Thursday, 8pm.
 It'll be a window seat.
 There's something I want you to see.
 So, when you think about it
like that...
 I need help.
 ...it's a wonder we trust anyone at all.
 Modeh Anee Lefanecha...
 Don't be afraid.
 I'm safe.
 I can't do this.
 ...if it's the price...
 ...for a nation.
 That's fine, thanks.
Do you have your passport, please?
 Ah, you are Israeli,
 Mr...
 ...Geffen?
 Yes.
 My parents have emigrated there.
 I even speak a little bit of Hebrew
myself.
 In England, I only speak English.
 Of course.
 My apologies. Enjoy your stay, Mr Geffen.
 Room 90.
 Yes?
 Mr Geffen?
 I'm sorry, sir, a fault's been reported
on your fire alarm.
 - What?
- I need to check your alarm.
 Go away.
 I'm sorry, sir, I have to check it.
 It'll take me seconds,
it's just a reset switch.
 I'm busy.
 It's hotel policy, I'm so sorry.
 Do you mind
if I just switch on your lights?
 No, it's not that one.
 Do you mind if I check your bathroom?
 Somebody's using it.
 Er, then I'll wait.
 He wants to check the bathroom.
 Good evening, madam.
 Yes, this one.
 Done.
 I'm so sorry to have disturbed you,
especially at this time of night.
 Sleep well.
 Housekeeping.
 Yeah, there was a guy just in our room.
 Yes, that's correct. I do apologise.
A fault came up on our board.
 Yes, he's...
 brown-haired, late 20s,
about five foot six or seven.
 Thank you, madam.
 So sorry for the inconvenience.
 Well done.
 Got it.
 You need to leave.
 Now.
 That's room 90.
 It's a fire.
 We're blown.
 You lost them.
 400 people all out on the street.
 She knew we would.
 If she knows anything.
It could just have been a precaution.
 We got...this.
 Wow.
 Niki Lauda.
 Who is he?
 - What are those?
- Ceremonial shovels.
 The idea is that both you and El-Amin
have one at the launch.
 OK.
 The problem is which one to choose.
 This one's Palestinian-made.
This one's Israeli.
 This one's got an Israeli handle on,
but a Palestinian blade,
 and this one's the other way round.
 What you really need is a blade that's
half and half, split down the middle,
 so that both sides strike the ground
at the same time.
 So do that.
 What if they crack, break apart?
 I'm not sure that's the photo opportunity
you're looking for.
 What's the alternative?
 To these?
 Well, there's also going to be
a great big digger.
 - Go with that one.
 Hello?
 I'm aware of what you're doing.
 I know what you're doing for the child.
 Have you told the police?
 It's not my job.
 What's your job?
 You know what?
I'm not sure any more.
 Maybe I should stop doing it.
 Because of that
I'm supposed to trust you?
 If there's one person you should trust
in all this, it's Shlomo Zahary.
 Is the boy all right?
 And when will you get him back?
 How did you work all this out?
 I'm still trying to.
 What is it they want that requires you
to stay in your position?
 I'm not going to discuss
my business with you.
 So it is about your business?
 And...what about Monica Chatwin?
 Don't pull me in on your turf war.
 Except I think she's involved in yours.
 - I'm not in one.
- I can link her to your brother.
 I can link her to that listening device.
 How?
 And I can link that device
to the Americans.
 And I can link the Americans
to the killing of Samir Meshal.
 I just can.
 But...as yet...
 ...I don't have a link for this.
 His name's Enad Geffen. He's Israeli.
 He entered this country a month ago
on a visitor's permit.
 What's the link between Monica Chatwin
and the Israelis?
 There isn't one.
 Except there it is.
 Oh, he's not Israeli.
 You know him?
 He was... When I was captured in Gaza...
 ...he was the one who...
 He's Palestinian?
 So why is he here?
 To threaten me.
 I should imagine you feel
threatened enough as it is.
 It's yours.
 The child's yours.
 Oh, Nessa...
 I'm so sorry.
 I don't need pity from a spy.
 I'm not saying it as a spy.
 This is my...
 security adviser's number.
 You're not the only one
who's looking at Monica Chatwin.
 I will let him know you're going to call.
 I think he may be able to help you
in some way.
 - I think you're the one who needs help.
- No, I absolutely do not.
 She's talking to your rapist.
 Have you never talked to a bad person
to get a good thing done?
 - Is she getting a good thing done?
- I am!
 Thank you very much for coming.
 Nessa, you need my help.
 Do you know what? Actually, I do.
 There is one thing you could help me with.
 Mrs Crace?
 Oh, no.
 - Don't make it worse.
- What have you said?
 I've told her who you are, what you are.
 She's lying.
 The fucking bitch is lying.
 I know your blood type,
I've told her what it is.
 No.
 How could you do that?
 How could you do that to her?
 How could you do this to any of us?
 Where have you been?
 Out.
 Why did you tell her?
 Because she has the right to know.
 Why don't you tell
the whole fucking world, Atika?
 This is her house.
 - If you know, so should she.
- That's my decision.
 She's my wife.
 My wife.
 - It wasn't yours to make.
- And when did it become yours?
 I didn't have a choice, Ephra.
 You didn't give me one.
 So, what, now you're trying
to ruin my marriage?
 Is that what you're trying to do?
 Do you really want to keep it?
 What?
 Do you?
 I have to leave.
 No.
 I can't stay here now, not any more.
 No, you can't go.
 What would they all think if you did?
 - I don't know what to do.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
 I am sorry. Ssh!
 - It was all my fault.
- No, it was mine, mine.
 I took her to Gaza.
 Yeah, I'm the one who made her go.
 I've kept so many lies.
 So have I.
 Which ones?
 Too many to count.
 You and I...
 ...we are one.
 Yes.
 Monica Chatwin is working
for the Palestinians.
 To be ensuring they have a man
standing beside Nessa Stein.
 Who isn't Shlomo Zahary.
 Who isn't an Israeli.
 But why is she doing that?
 This may be helping you to find out.
 She has one phone
 she only uses for very rare things,
very rare.
 We found her having it because she used it
 to call Nathaniel Bloom
for a coffee meeting many months ago.
 Since then, she has been...being called
by one phone
 in the UK, two nights ago.
 And she is calling with it
to another phone in...
 Holland.
 And another
 in Washington.
 The United States.
 Do you know what was said?
 No, but these calls I'm suggesting
you should now be listening in to.
 You know she wants my job?
 I think maybe she's getting it.
 Good morning.
 There have been many obstacles
for us to overcome
 in order to be here today,
 not least the death of our colleague,
Samir Meshal,
 to whose family our thoughts go out,
particularly today.
 But I know that what he wished for,
with all his heart...
 was for this day to come.
 - What's happened to your new partner?
- I'm sure he'll be here in a moment.
 In the meantime,
 I'm happy to answer any questions.
 What would your father think of today?
 I hope he'd be very proud.
 "The Sword of Israel", and his daughter
holding her hand out to the Palestinians?
 As I have continued to say
throughout this whole process,
 anything that contributes to
promoting stability in the region
 I hope will be greeted with enthusiasm
on all sides.
 And I believe it is.
I mean, otherwise,
 we simply wouldn't be here today.
 So you think you are single-handedly
solving this problem?
 No.
 What we're doing here today
is just a feather in the dove.
 But you are part of the dove.
 Well, I certainly hope so.
 What about
Tahet Technologies' relationship
 with the PLO's terrorist past?
 Those accusations are unsubstantiated.
 But they still exist.
 If every rumour in this region
were taken as fact, then...
 ...well, then, personally
I would know for a fact
 that TV2 news anchor Ido Zamir would be
standing here beside me right now
 and I'd be bouncing our love child
on my hip.
 It's not true, then?
 Er, for the moment, I'm going to deny it.
 So you don't feel compromised?
 By what?
 Your relationship with Tahet.
 Not at all.
 We all have a past.
 Look at my own family name,
 what it's meant to different people
on different sides of the border.
 But today,
 today is a day
to let those differences go.
 Today is a day to look toward the future.
 Ladies and gentlemen, Tahet's CEO, Jalal
El-Amin, has been unavoidably detained
 so may I suggest you hold all further
questions until this afternoon?
 And just to confirm, the ceremony
will take place in Hebron at 3pm.
 Until then, thank you.
 So, what?
 He's ill. Food poisoning.
 Good morning.
 Good morning.
 Are you ready?
 I feel like a 16-year-old.
 You're supposed to.
 Now, go on.
 Start running.
 Have you ever seen The Towering Inferno?
 No.
 No. It's very good.
 Robert Wagner.
 Don't worry, Lorrie,
no-one's gonna die.
 - He's got to be there.
- I know...
 No, he's got to be. Shit!
 What did he eat?
 I don't know, it's obviously
 - pretty bad.
- Frances, I don't care if he's
 on his fucking deathbed,
he's got to be there this afternoon.
 As-salamu alaykum.
 Wa'alaykum-salam.
 I saw him go for a run this morning.
 Ephra? Running?
 I don't think so.
 Maybe...he wants to get away from things.
 Well, that kind of running.
 That makes perfect sense.
 If only I could do the same.
 You should stay in bed.
 All right, they're gonna get him up.
 Fuck knows what it's going to look like
if he starts vomiting all over his shovel.
 We're still using those?
 Just for the photo,
then you'll get in the digger.
 - All I have to do is start it up?
- Exactly.
 I don't want to start swinging that thing
around when I don't know what I'm doing.
 There's an engineer, he'll be right there,
he'll explain it all.
 Although I'm reassured
it's simply a key in the ignition.
 What?
 I'm so sorry,
I should have thought of this.
 What?
 You can't wear a dress.
 - Why?
- Think about it.
 You can't go climbing up a ladder
into a cabin in a dress.
 Really?
 Really. You're going to
have to wear trousers.
 Look at this!
 A world event rapidly turning into
Carry On Up The Kibbutz.
 - When did this happen?
- What?
 When was this clause added?
 16B.
 He can hold on to the rights to this deal
no matter what happens in the future?
 No matter what?
 And that...
 is your signature.
 Yes.
 Nessa...
 I've stood beside you for six years,
 hearing you say that you cannot be
compromised, will not be.
 So why this?
Why have you signed this?
 When it is absolutely obvious
that you shouldn't.
 Well...
 you're compromised now.
 And you've done it to yourself.
 Do you trust me?
 Trust me now.
 Well, he's up.
 Good.
 The man you've just bequeathed
half your company to.
 Although with the amount of Imodium
they've poured down his throat,
 he won't be shitting for 16 years.
 Then we should go.
 I'm doing the right thing...
 Frances.
 I hope so.
 Hi. My name's Ephra. Today, I'll mostly
be having a nervous breakdown
 and running away from it all.
What's your alibi?
 I've got to see my part-time tutor.
 Fantastic. I've always admired
an educated woman.
 Drive on.
 Here we go.
 - Salamu alaykum.
- Alaykum-salam.
 Salamu alaykum.
 Alaykum-salam.
 Shall we stop for a picture?
 Alaykum-salam.
 Salamu-alaykam.
 Thank you.
 Just right up onto stage? OK.
 You made it.
 Of course.
 How are you feeling?
 Let's get this thing done.
 Wait. Wait.
 - Wait.
- What?
 Let's switch the phones off.
 Go away, world.
 Shall we trade?
 OK?
 You have a scar...here.
 Yes.
 A dog.
 A dog?
 Yes.
 When I was five.
 Hello.
 Hello?
 some years ago, I came to Bethlehem
and gave a very bad speech,
 so I should probably learn the lesson
of that and keep this one short.
 But strangely enough...
 ...what I ended up saying that day...
 ...hadn't been pre-written or rehearsed.
 I just said it from my heart.
 And I think what I said then
still holds true today.
 All this technology,
all this fibre optics...
 ...last mile boxes....
 ...all this wizardry...
 ...all this speed...
 ...that's around us right now...
 ...what it's all really about
 is very, very simple.
 It's about our need to communicate
with each other.
 And with others.
 Here...
 ...and there.
 Talk.
 Trade.
 Understand.
 And that's it.
 There's no secret to it.
 Not any more.
 When will we be reunited?
 - This evening.
- Then I think we're done here.
 And what's next?
 The digger.
 Shalom.
 Salam.
 Thank you.
 OK.
 What do I do?
 Turn here......then your finger...
 press.
 Do I need to wait for a cue or...?
 No...
 Now...
 There's something wrong with the ignition.
 This is BBC News.
The headlines at three o'clock.
 The Prime Minister recognises...
 What are you doing?
 - Just wanted to catch the news.
- Oh, don't!
 - What will you give me for it?
- Please, Ephra, switch it off.
 A big one. Right here.
 ...And in cricket, England insist
their team are equal to the task...
 Is this going to happen every time
I try and turn on a TV?
 You tell me.
 You're here...
 Do you think I'm that stupid?
 Are you alone?
 What?
 You think only people like you are
clever enough to slip away unnoticed?
 Rachel, are you alone?
 Clearly.
 Rachel, I...
 - You must leave.
- What?
 Now!
 How dare you?
 - My husband, my life...
- Come on.
 - What are you doing?
- You have to leave...
 Don't tell me what to do!
 - Atika, it's too late.
- It's not. Not if she leaves now.
 ...A huge explosion...
- What?
 - You've got to go.
- W-Why?
 What's this?
 Hebron is the location scheduled today for
the opening of a data cabling network
 spreading throughout the West Bank
that has been
 - championed and coordinated...
- Oh, Nessa.
 - Baroness Stein was intended to be...
 ...present at the ceremonial opening.
 Her whereabouts at this point are...
 Calm down!
 OK?
 Listen to me.
Do you have a gun in this house?
 Do you have a gun in this house?
 Where?
 Are you all right?
 Are you all right?
 OK. Take this.
 - Take this!
- What's happening?
 You weren't supposed to be here.
You don't move. Stay here.
 ...Amongst the casualties.
 Despite the immediate tragedy...
 ...Consider the cause of the blast...
 ...Can't and shouldn't be ruled
out at this stage -
 the very real possibility of a terrorist
attack has to be considered.
 Nessa Stein and her company have been
in the jaws of this complex region
 for many years, and although her efforts
at reconciliation
 between Israel and the Palestinian
territories have been unending,
 so, too, has the disquiet felt in certain
circles on both sides of the divide
 at her presence in the region...
 Nessa Stein was recently made
a life peer
 for her efforts in international
reconciliation
 but her own personal story is
far from peaceful...
 ...Nessa Stein is one of two children
born to Eli Stein, the Zionist...
 ...and worked closely with the IDF...
 ...Six-Day War, right up to the invasion
of Lebanon in 1 982...
 You killed my husband.
 You led him here.
 OK, Rachel...
 Calm down.
 OK.
 Put this gun down.
 Put it down. Come...
 Give it to me.
 Give it to me. Give it to me.
 Ssh, Rachel. Rachel.
 Rachel... OK.
 ...Attended exclusive British
public schools,
 disappeared from the public stage
only to re-emerge two decades later...
 ...control of their father's empire.
 ...Between Israel
and the Palestinian territories.
 This, along with an extensive educational
programme within the territories,
 ensured a radical change of profile
for the Steins,
 which culminated in Nessa Stein
joining the House of Lords
 as an independent member,
not affiliated with a party,
 in recognition of
her ongoing efforts for...
 - This is Dagon.
- Yes?
 Ephra Stein is dead.
 Why are you using this phone?
 Because he is dead too.
 How?
 Ephra Stein's wife, she shot him.
 She wasn't supposed to be there.
 - She followed us.
- Where is she now?
 - Also dead.
- How?
 I killed her.
 Could it be as if he did it?
 Yes.
 Then stick to the plan. Leave now.
 She's dead?
 - They think so.
- Survivors?
 Not intended.
 There's a hole in the ground
about 30ft across.
 Let me know immediately.
 Ephra Stein is missing.
 So is his wife.
 And Atika Halabi,
the missing child's mother.
 - Safe-housed?
- Not by us.
 We've just had activity
on Monica Chatwin's phone.
 - You're listening in on Monica Chatwin?
- She has a satellite phone
 which doesn't appear to be accounted for
on her expenses.
 And...?
 She's been rung again by the same
number that called her last week.
 Audio?
 No. Just number and duration.
 All right. Log it. We'll get back to it.
 - It's just...
- Have you been watching the TV?
 - It's really very exciting.
- This number...
 the closest we can place it
is Ephra Stein's holiday home.
 She's on again.
 Why can't we hear it?
 We haven't had a chance to
access her phone.
 - And she's calling...
- Holland.
 Holland.
 Utrecht.
 Claim it.
 They're approaching the Steins'
second home now.
 Can you pull that up?
 Yeah, we've got a feed.
 Two male fatalities.
 One IC6.
 Israeli.
 Name - Enad Geffen.
 Actually, we need to discuss that.
 Really? Just that
 Second male fatality - IC1.
 Ephra Stein.
 Rachel, push!
 - Push. OK.
 Female, IC1, in labour.
 Jesus.
 See why I never came off the Pill?
 She killed my husband!
 She helped kill my husband!
 Put the gun down!
 What the fuck is going on?
 We've just had a claim
posted on the internet
 for the assassination of both Nessa Stein
and Ephra Stein.
 - Who by?
- Coming up now.
 I think I'm still asleep.
 The baby is coming. Help me.
 - Who made the claim, Max?
- League of Samaria.
 Israelis? Oh, shit.
 Coming up now...
 Oh, for fuck's sake!
Will you switch that woman off?
 A child?
 Yes. The one that's been taken.
 And you didn't think to tell me?
 I can't fetch a ball
and talk at the same time,
 old dog that I am.
 Fuck.
 She has children at home.
 Someone will need to collect them
from school.
 She's up again.
 USA, east coast.
 Washington.
 Bethesda.
 Exeter Road.
 Moorland Lane.
 Call terminated.
 That's as close as we can get.
 Now we wait for the aftershock.
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
 Tragically, within the central grouping,
 there are reported to be no survivors.
 74 souls have yet to be accounted for.
 - Including Nessa Stein?
- Yes, including Nessa Stein.
 Her press adviser, Frances Pirsig,
 is reported to be amongst that number,
 as are many of her team.
 However, Jalal El-Amin,
her partner in this cable venture,
 is amongst the survivors.
 The State of Israel categorically
denounces these horrendous crimes.
 Over many years we have worked tirelessly
with the Stein company
 to help achieve its aim
of peaceful reconciliation
 and these heinous acts of violence
will do nothing
 to shake our resolve to
continue along this path.
 How do you respond to the fact an Israeli
extremist group has claimed the murders
 and that its leader, Yaniv Levi,
has remained at liberty
 and clearly unmonitored
by your security forces?
 I can assure you these issues will be
addressed at the very highest level.
 Dutch police, acting on information
received from an anonymous source,
 raided an apartment in Utrecht
earlier today,
 finding inside the body of known
Israeli activist Yaniv Levi.
 It wasn't us.
 It's the same as Samir Meshal,
we wanted to bring him in but...
 - Someone got there first.
- Again.
 The man who shot Ephra Stein,
his passport is a fake.
 We're aware. But you've no idea who he is.
 We have no record of him.
 Whatever we may or may not
have done in the past,
 we didn't kill Nessa Stein or her brother.
 Except that world opinion
seems to think you did.
 We've run a list of all government workers
resident in the Bethesda area.
 As you can imagine, there's quite a few.
 But on Moorland Lane there's just one.
 Kate Larsson, special adviser...
 To the Secretary of State.
 What's her background?
 Ivy League. Homeland Department.
 Defence procurement then State Department.
Not a particularly noisy individual,
 although we did trowel up a piece
she wrote in 1 999
 for the New Republic which was...
pretty hawkish.
 How much CCTV footage do we have
of Samir Meshal's hotel
 during his stay in Washington?
 Within the lobby, the complete period.
 Start looking.
 Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
 Of course, at this stage it is too early
to give any definitive reactions
 to these events,
but once the facts are gathered, um,
 you can expect a full
and unambiguous response
 from the Secretary of State.
 Will that involve
a full, unambiguous condemnation of
 Israel's failure to rein in
its own domestic extremists?
 If what looks to have
happened actually has,
 then, yes, you can expect a very strong
response from this department.
 And from the Secretary of State
herself?
 Yes, she has agreed.
 But obviously it is vital
that the facts are verified
 before any such comment might
or would be...
 And from the Secretary of State herself?
 Yes, she has agreed.
 Yes, she has agreed.
 Yes, she has agreed.
