 You'll fall ill again. Who cares? They'll kill us anyway. We shall find a way, wait and see. No one will save you. Unless you tell us where the witch is. You think the Benandanti have accepted you into the fold. You dress up as a man. You fight. But true strength and true power are not necessarily only the hallmark of men. Who are you really fighting for? For your convictions... or for theirs? Open! Open, let me out!

 Open this door and let me go! Let me out! - Ade, calm down now. - I said I want out! I am sorry, but I can't risk losing you. You will lose Leptis this way. Wasn't she the love of your life? Let me out! Are you all right? You did the right thing. We don't know where they are keeping them. And what they will do to them. Let me go. It's too dangerous. We can't stay holed up in here waiting for something to happen. I'll go. And if they catch you too? What will we do? Let me go. Agreed, Persepolis. - Petra, you go with her. - No. I shall go alone. I can manage. Pelts for only four silvers today. They are for the Candle Festival, aren't they? Mm-hmm. This matches your eyes perfectly. Only three silvers, and I'm sure you will be the most beautiful at the festival. Spirto, I need your help. - I've got to save that young boy. - But he tried to kill your father! We can't kill a child. And it would kill Ade too. Did you see what happened at the inn? She was with those witches. Your girlfriend lives with those witches. Would you burn her at the stake for this? They will call me traitor. Spirto, only you can help me. It's my last request to you. All right. What do I have to do? You've got to leave that house. - They are my sisters. - But if something happened to you? - If they caught you? - It hasn't happened. I couldn't bear seeing you there, never. Enveloped in flames like that child. What? They want to execute them? When? After the Candle Festival. At dawn. But he's only a child. You've got to tell me where they have hidden them. In the dungeons. Cardinal Oreggi imprisoned them there. And he has hidden the key, an enchanted key. Tell them. Then he told me that Pietro wanted to see Ade. He's waiting for her at the fountain, before sunset. Tebe, let me go. It could be a trap. Pietro would never do such a thing. The execution has already been set, didn't you hear? It's our only chance! And do you trust Sante's son? The right question is how can he still trust me. What about you? Do you trust that boy? As much as you trust Leptis. There's nobody here! Ade, let's go. He'll come. I'm sure. Everything is fine. You can trust her. I trust you. I'm sorry, Pietro. Nothing went as it was supposed to. I know I can't change the past. But I really want to help you. Be quick. You know she's in danger here. We are all in danger. But perhaps I've found a way to free them. How? Why are you doing this for us? I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for her. You are willing to betray even your father for her? You are like him. You believe in dreams, in magic. I only believe in what I see. Agreed. We accept your help, Pietro. What can you do? There's a key. It's well hidden, but I've sent Spirto to get it. Once we've got this key... we will meet up at the Candle Festival. And there we'll deliver it to you. Let me guess. You can't sleep. You'll see that we can set them free from there. Have you ever been to the Candle Festival? No. What does it celebrate? It's an ancient tradition. A kind of ritual... to ward off the evil eye... epidemics... and witches! The people of Serra dress up and wear masks. Lots of candles are lit and placed at the windows and on the window sills. The town looks like a field full of fireflies. In the square, everyone plays music, dances, drinks, eats. I don't know how to dance. - Let's go. - Where?

Soon... you shall have to choose between night... and day. Rose, jasmine, bergamot. Come. Try one. Try the bergamot. Come, madam. Try one. Lets go. We can't dance. - You're my friend, right? - Of course. What kind of question is that? Then don't be offended if I tell you that sometimes you understand nothing at all. Thanks a lot, dear friend. The most important things always happen when you're doing something else. Hi, Half-skirt. I've got something for you. I see you've been practicing. - Pietro, I... - No names. At the moment, we are only two strangers dancing. - I thought you didn't know how to dance. - And I thought you didn't either. Never lower your eyes when dancing.

Ventus et fulgor exaudi me voca. Surge et unus ex corde terrae. Magna matris nostrae voca me audies... ...protegis et filiae tuae. You're trapped. I wouldn't move if I were you. Ventus et fulgor veni et libera nos... ...a virorum imperio. Tebe. It's been a long time. Your old tricks don't work here. Oreggi. Did yours allow you to read the Book of Kingdoms? I am a patient man. I see you still bring your guard dog along. Careful! Dogs can bite. And they are faithful. This obsession of yours with faithfulness... Stubbornness that your beloved Leptis showed too. As we read in Luke: "I came to bring fire to the world. And how I wish it were already burning." Take them away. How are you? Did they hurt you? They hurt her. I thought I had lost you. I would never have given you such satisfaction. Is she here? I beg you, Cesaria. Take me to her. You are not like them! I know it. You have never been. - It wasn't me who betrayed you, I swear. - I know. I shall stop them. Everything will be fine. Let's go. Stand up. - Undress. - No. Do you want me to call the others? Him too. No, not him. I'll do it. Take them off. Father! Father! Forgive me, my friend. Next time you decide to ask me a favor, I will make sure I'm really far away from Serra. We have to go. The stakes are ready. Put them to death! Eight. There are only eight. You! Come with me. Go! Go! No! Get off me! - He wants you, not him! - No! Valente! - Come. - No! No! - No! - Move! Get off me! Move! No! This is where you belong, Ade. People of Serra! Friends. What is evil? Evil... Evil is not an idea. It is not an abstract, intangible entity, but it's here, among us! It creeps behind us, it hides in our midst. It's our neighbor... The old woman who smiles at us while selling bread. A child! Or the women... who have chosen to shun God... and worship the cult of witchcraft. Look at them! Look at them! They look just like us... but they aren't. But you need no longer be afraid. Soon the people of Serra will be freed from evil. As I had promised. Look over there! O merciful Lord... Libera nos a maleficis. Libera nos. The witches! Surround them! Stop! Where are you going? Father, stop! Ade, come! - Pietro... - Let's go! Pietro! Father, please, do not die. Promise me you'll protect Serra. With your life. Don't leave me, please. Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine.

Go to them. I'm not like them. I don't know who I am. No one is what they seem, my daughter. Did you know? Yes. I knew. The day she was born... I knew who she was... ...The Chosen One. The only way to protect her... was to hide to the world... and to herself... who she really was. I decided to use all my power... renouncing my youth... to turn her into a boy. So she could be safe. Masculum et feminam fit et fiet puer natus est... et erit in lucem ac tenebras. The spell would have lasted till the first black moon. Then, her real nature... would have been revealed. I had to protect you both. I couldn't tell you the truth... - I had to choose for you. - You cannot choose for me. I'm not interested in your truths. I'm not interested in you! There's never only one truth, my daughter. Never. Soon you'll be called to find yours, and you have to be ready. - You've always lied to me. - A mother can even lie for love. - For the love of whom? - Believe me. I had no choice. Enough! Go away! Vanesce! Here, before your lifeless body... I swear... that I will guide my comrades courageously... and I will not let a woman into my heart again. Spirto. Not only will you be part of the brigade... but you'll guide it... at my side. I swear on my honor... that the Benandanti will always come first and foremost. Even before my own self. You let the girl you supposedly loved kill your father... and now you're allowing this filthy traitor to join our ranks... making him our guide. A leader that is not able to recognize the valor and the loyalty of his men... doesn't deserve to be followed. Whoever is with me, draw his sword. And may Heaven preserve us. May courage guide us! May faith burn within us! I baptize you with the name of Luxor. Like the light that will preserve us from darkness. Ade. Ade, go... Go to them.
