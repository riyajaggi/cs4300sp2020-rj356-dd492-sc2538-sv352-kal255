They just disappeared, just got up, and waltzed away? - I think maybe what we've witnessed here is nothing short of a miracle. We need to go home and love one another, be good to each other. That's the lesson to take from this. - Maybe it was never even real to begin with. Maybe it was all just, like, a figment of imagination, a spiritual test that we overcame. - Okay, well, they certainly felt real when we drove over what felt like their skulls. - Don't say that, Kelvin. Don't be like that, projecting negativity. - Yeah, seriously, trying to act like we're gonna get in trouble or some shit. - There is one matter I'd like a little clarity on, though. - 'Sup? - The money.

You stole it from the church. - Yeah, duh. - So technically, it's not yours. - Uh, 'cept it is mine, 'cause I'm the one who found a hiding place. I had to sneak. I had to climb stuff. I had to think it through. I stole that money fair and square. You did not. [scoffs] - That money would be gone if it was not for my bravery and--and knowledge and courage to go back into the whole melee and grab those fucking bags. That's true facts. So now we need to figure out a meaningful way in which we can divvy it up. - No, no, no, no, how 'bout nobody gets a cut, okay? - Yeah. - How 'bout it all goes back to the church? - I like that plan.

You know, that they did it. And they fucking ran us over, then they picked us up and tossed us down the hill. And then you showed up when the coast was clear. - Man, this whole thing has just gotten so messed up. - [slurps] I need to see her. - Scotty, seeing her like this is not gonna make you feel any better. - Eh, if I can get her to make me cum, it will. Hold my sauce. [monitor beeping] Hey, you hang out here, and you keep a lookout. - Scotty, she's in no shape to do the things that you are thinking about doing in there.

[scoffs] I didn't hear my damn phone ringing. You know what, as far as I'm concerned, he's cancelled. If he don't give a flip about this family and don't want to be a part of it, that's fine with me. But what I do give a flip about is you not being honest with me. - Baby, I'm being honest with you. I'm telling you right now that he called and that we spoke. - I know, and we said that we weren't gonna speak to him. - Okay. - Now he got you and the boys aligning behind my back with our apostate son. I look like the bad guy. - Oh, baby, you're not the bad guy. You're not. - I know I'm not the bad guy.

Fuck you. You wanna do it? No, you don't. So shut the fuck up. Look, I got this. I got this. Fuck you. Go. Record this one. - It's been recording the whole time, Scott. - All right, shut the fuck up, dude. Fucking piece of shit. This mask smells like shit. All right, go again. [clears throat] [tauntingly] Hey, motherfuckers. - You scared? - No, not really. You know, this whole thing was my idea. Scotty can act like he's the leader of it and all, but, I mean, he wouldn't have anything if it weren't for me. - You two threw me down the hill, didn't you? - [coughs] No. No way. No, of course not. - You're a terrible liar. I weirdly expected this from him but not from you, you pussy bitch. [soft dramatic music] - No, seriously, Lucy. Lucy. - It's when we start believing we can take life into our own hands, resolve matters ourselves without the guiding hand of the Lord that we fall victim to the snakes of the world. - Mm. all: Amen. [applause] - Though cleverly disguised as a loving neighbor, a trusted friend, they will find their way in, folks. - They will. - Sometimes a snake will come into the garden, and when one does, you need to close them eyes, tilt that head up and say, "Good afternoon, Jesus." - Yeah. - "Good afternoon, Lord." That's not gonna bother Him a bit. I promise. - [whispers] I'll be right back.

The one you got has passed. - Nuh-uh, mine looked like he was gonna be fine. The back fender probably just gave him a charley horse or something. - Looks worse than that. - Kelvin, shut up. Who cares, all right? What we need to do here is figure out who these idiots are, and apparently, there's three of 'em. Let's brainstorm, okay? Let's have a spitball sesh right now, come up with some ideas. How are we gonna find these guys? Levi. - We can make a flyer with a pic of the van, see if anybody's seen it. - [laughs] [laughter] They ain't a lost cat, Levi. Jeez, man. They ain't running for school president. - Yeah, dumb. Fuck off outta here with that idea, Levi. - Okay, this is a safe space. We can pitch freely. Anybody else got anything? Gregory, you got something? - Not yet. - Yeah, not yet. Of course. I'm not gonna hold my breath. - Uh, I have a real idea. - Oh, well, let me guess. "We should tell Daddy and turn ourselves in." - All right, do you-- do you want my idea? - Well, let's hear it. - Okay, then shut up real quick. Thank you. Traffic cams, right? They got videotapes on them, and when cars drive through 'em, it will videotape that footage. So I say we go and get traffic cam footage from, like, the area that night, and then we can track where they went. - Well, is that, like, a real thing? - Yeah, it is. Every red light has a camera and, like, tons of technologies on it. - Look at him. That's my baby bro-bro right there. - Don't touch me. - Thank you for participating instead of being mopey for once in your life. This is good. This is exactly what we need. Thank you, buddy. So Kelvin's figured out that much. I need that traffic cam footage. Who in here's gonna get it for me? - Not me. I've done enough already. - Gregory, what if Jesus Christ just did one or two things and was like, "I'm good. I don't need to die on the cross." Where would we be then? - I don't know, Jess. - Get your head out of your asshole, okay? - I think I know someone who could help. - See, you have form RG004A. You need form FR309 for a fleet policy of 25 or more vehicles, which is the situation you're in. So once you fill that form out, you can come back up here and we'll get-- I'll--I'll help you with further assistance. God bless you. - [softly] Yo, what's up? Okay, yeah. Over--over back? [keyboard clacking] - I could lose my job for this, but I'd do anything for you. You know that, Kelvin. - I know. - You saved me from the darkness, brought me to the light. I owe you everything. You know, I'd even kill myself if you asked me to. - What the hell? - I know, buddy. [pats shoulder] You tell me that a lot. - Okay, I would, though. - I'm not gonna tell you to kill yourself. - Okay. - So these guys in the red van here, they're--uh, they're our buds and our friends, you know? And we're just playing some pranks with them. - Yeah, just car pranks, your average car prank. - Well, I trust you, friend. - I know. - Here's that van crossing the intersection that you gave me. And then cameras catch the van for about a mile, and then we lose 'em. - Huh. - But then we pick them up again on a cam near the hospital. And, uh, a few hours later, a camera picks the van up as it's leaving the hospital. And then, um, we end up following them all the way on cams to right there. [pensive music] - And how long ago was that? - A week ago. - And where are they now? - They're still there, the same place they were a-- a week ago.
