 Previously on Terriers: - Who's this? - Ben. Laura Ross. She's a free-lance journalist. A few pieces for local papers, but mostly online. Maybe we can call that cell, tell her to get out. Just keep walking. They're coming. - You, who are you? - I'm a private detective. I've been working one side of this thing, you've been working the other, and I think it's a whole lot bigger than either of us suspected. Really?

 - I'll be in touch. - Thank you. Tonight is karaoke night. Two Long Islands. I don't really remember much from that night. There's not much to remember. You were charmed and intrigued, and then went home with Professor Owen. I'm gonna lose him. You're gonna lie to him. This never happened. He can never know about this. Why did you do it?! I don't know! I don't know! What did I do wrong? I never want to see you again. Hey, I was thinking... You know what you should do? What?

 Put your shit back, go into the kitchen, whip up a sumptuous repast, light some candles, wait for the woman you love to come home and have a great goddamn life. You saying I should forgive her? It's implied. Just a suggestion. Or how about this. Punish her. Punish her by marrying her and reminding her every single day about what she did to you. Or what I could do is punish her by staying here and making her move in with you. - Hey. - Hey. I thought you'd be gone by now. We got kind of a late start. You didn't see the truck? Yeah, I saw it. Um, I left the ring out. Did you find it? I didn't see it. I'll get it. - Okay. - I didn't mean that. Yeah, I know. It's cool. Winston, let's go. - You're taking Winston? - Well... You want him? You just are going to give him up that easy? What are you talking about? That's not what... You want the dog? I kinda got him for you, so if you want him... Yeah, I thought we got him for us. I can't cut him in half, Katie! What do you want to do?! Do you want him or no? - He should be with you. - Okay, thanks. Let's go, come on. Let's go. Wait. Come here. Good-bye, Winston. I love you. Good boy. Good boy. Come on, Winston. If you're going to be really crazy, Steph's bedroll is still up in the attic if you're so inclined. I think I'll stick with the guest bedroom. Suit yourself. Who's a good sweet potato? Look at you, you scary. Come here. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Oh.. you're so cute. Give me a kiss. Oh, sorry. I let myself in. I hope you don't mind. Probably better not to be loitering around your domicile. Smart. Uh, Britt, this is Laura Ross. - The woman I spirited away from danger. - In a limo. So you didn't hang out with them on their honeymoon? I think that may have been awkward. - Friends of yours? - Not exactly. Going through some boxes and these cans. Nice to meet you. - He okay? - Not really. - Can I get you water? Anything? - Sure. - I was admiring your artwork. - You like that, huh? The original is in the Guggenheim. Site owns 3000 acres. You have any idea what he plans to build on 'em? Not yet. I'm actually here about a different case. Really? The name Billy Whitman ring a bell? Yeah. I ran into Whitman during my cop days. I know. I did a little research into your past. The Whitman case got you fired. Mm-hmm. And arguably ruined my marriage. Never could close it, though. Well, I think I may have just solved it. First degree possession of a controlled substance, trafficking within a thousand yards of a school, second degree evading police. You've had quite a night, Dobs. I've had worse. Yeah, well, it's about to get worse if you don't tell us who's been supplying you with the shit. - Rablido. - Yes, sir. Mind booking this d-bag for me? - Oh, absolutely. - My man. - Let's go, d-bag - Get outta here. I see two weeks living in filth finally paid off. - Yeah, well.. - This guy gonna talk? He just needs time to contemplate his options. Alright. While he's doing that we got something else. Condo Raper hit Brunswick Heights tonight. - Christ, that's number, uh.. - Seven That we know of. Reynolds is over at county getting the vic's statement. Good news, though. We got a suspect. This guy. Caught fleeing the scene. Guess who our witness is? Billy Whitman. - Oh, no shit? - Yeah. Is that name supposed to mean something? The La Jolla Whitmans. The Whitman Library. You know, that stadium over at the USV campus? They built that. Just so their son wouldn't get expelled. Suspect tried to boost Whitman's Beemer. Whitman took exception. Kept him there till we got there. Oh, rich guy's a hero. This kid here... He's small. He doesn't match the description of the rape suspect we've gotten from any of the vics' statements. So maybe a guy with a mask sweating on top of you... He seems a little bigger than he is. What in the hell is a rich guy like Whitman doing over in Brunswick Heights? All right. Hank, suspect's in interrogation. I would like one of you in there with him before he decides to ask for an attorney. - You got it. - Thank you. - You're a cop? - Detective. It's casual Friday. - It's Thursday. - So, uh... Brett, is it? - Britt. - Whatever. If you're a cop, I want to lodge a complaint. That guy assaulted me. Yeah, well, you were trying to steal his car. That's what he says. I was just admiring the interior. From the inside. Yeah. Says here you live off DeMille Avenue. What were you doing in Brunswick Heights? I was thinking about moving. DeMille's got too much crime. I wonder why. You've got a larcenous heart, Mr. Pollack. You like stealing stuff, huh? No real prison time. Just a couple of stretches in CYA. I had a troubled youth. So what's the progression, Britt? Seriously, I'm curious. One night you decide to break into a house, steal a stereo. Except this time you come across a pair of panties on the floor... soiled. Give 'em a sniff. You get excited. Your heart is racing, but you have to come back later. This time you don't have a WiFi in your crosshairs. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about this. Dude, this isn't me. It says this guy's six-foot, two. - I see a resemblance. - He's wearing a mask. And dark clothes. Yeah, lots of people do, man, it's slimming. That's funny. Let me tell you about Slim. Slim here raped seven women. He targets women who live alone. He waits for them to come home and then he rapes them. For hours. And then Slim makes them take a bath to wash away all the physical evidence. The last instance was tonight... About 100 yards from where we picked you up. So what was it, man, huh? You need Whitman's car for a getaway? - I don't know anything about that. - Yeah? What do you know about this? 'Cause they nabbed this off you when they brought you in an hour ago. This is your lock pick set. Now you think we're going to find any residue from the victim's windowsill on these things? Hmm? - She gonna be okay, man? - Who? - The girl he tried to rape tonight? - Who says he just tried? Hey, Reynolds, what does your victim say? She wasn't raped. The guy never got that far. She said something spooked him and he ran. That kid in the interrogation room... That's what spooked him. - Wait, he's not our guy? - He's a petty thief. He's not a rapist. My guess is he got the right place at the wrong time. Probably saved that woman tonight. Oh, you want to throw him a parade? No, but the least we can do is, uh, cut the charges on him. - You got to be kidding. - No, no, no, no, no. He's just staying mum right now because he doesn't want to add to his problems. But if we cut him loose, he might open up and I.D. the suspect. He's a good kid, Mark. He asked about the victim. Oh, he's a eagle scout. Broke in on the woman, saw her being attacked and then he ran. Captain, thought you might want to hear this. Came in to 911 earlier. 911, what's your emergency? Yeah, uh, I'm at 1916 Cole Street. Brunswick Heights. There's a woman... She's screaming here. I think she might be in trouble, man. Send somebody. That's him. Kick him loose. I'm gonna go have a cigarette. You know, Dobbs is squealing in lockup. Looks like he's ready to start ratting on his supplier. - Good, good. - Yeah. Prince Valiant running in here to share his wealth of knowledge? This Billy Whitman, he said he was in the neighborhood visiting a lady friend, didn't want to name a name because she's married. Yeah, that sounds about right. That thing you were telling me about him almost getting expelled from USC, when did that happen? Sometime in the '90s. It was a frat party gone wrong, if my memory serves me. Must have gone really wrong for his parents to want to spring for a new football stadium. You would love that, wouldn't you? Make Whitman our rapist; rich white dude with a car that you would never be able to afford. Yeah, must be him, right? I'm just covering my bases. That ain't cream. Sweetener. What time is it? - 9:30. - Oh, man, I tied one on last night. Mmm. I got in so late, I didn't want to wake you. You look beautiful. I have that City Council thing this morning. Oh, okay. I should move my truck. You don't have to. It's on the lawn, Hank. - Hmm. - It's funny. I thought being married to a cop, I'd be biting my nails every day until your shift ended. Turns out I am only concerned for your safety only when you're off duty. Yeah. Hey, um, what time do we have that thing tonight with, um, Rick and Sandy? We don't. That was last night. Man, I'm batting a thousand here, huh? You're just lucky I can't stand her. - See? I did it for you. - I gotta run. Oh, hey, Gretch, I wanted to ask you something. Um, you were at USC in the '90s, right? '92 to '95. Why? There was a guy there, who was probably a few years ahead of you Uh, Billy Whitman... Did you know him? What do you think? He seems pretty infamous. There was some kind of scandal, it was a frat party. You were probably a freshman. Hank, what are you doing? Why would you dredge this up now? Or do you have a list of all my old boyfriends? - Billy Whitman was your boyfriend?! - Look, what happened with Billy... The truth is I don't remember most of it, okay? And what I do remember, I spent the last 20 years trying to forget, so please, respect that. Hey! - Well? - I don't know, Hank. Who'd you say she was again? I'm Laura Ross... and I'm standing right here. - She's a reporter. - From what paper? I don't work for dead tree media. I'm an independent. I publish on the Web. So she blogs. Do you tweet? Just look at the evidence, Mark. It's right in front of you. - We have to reopen the case. - "We"?! Kemosabe, only one of us is still a cop here, remember? He's guilty. Guilty as sin. Yeah, I remember you saying something like that once before. This is bullshit. You don't arrest somebody for a broken taillight. You got pulled over for the taillight. You got arrested for being belligerent. - How was I being belligerent?! - There you go again. Whitman, William. We'll be in Interrogation. Come on. This, this is ridiculous. Look, write me a fix-it ticket. Or better, go cite the valet at Le Chaz. The taillight wasn't broken when I got to the restaurant. This is really interesting, Billy. You don't have much of a rep sheet. Why would I have a rep sheet? Because you've been in trouble. A bunch. Arrested quite a few times, and somehow it all just seems to go away. I'm gonna have your job, you know that? As long as I can have yours. Oh, I'm sorry. You don't have a job, do you? Or does being a rich prick who thinks he can get away with everything qualify as a profession? - I want to speak to your boss. - Let's talk about the women. - What women? - How about Monica Seldon? And Tracy Bright, Gina Randolph, Hortencia Cruz, April Grace? What about Nadine Wren? - I don't know any of these women. - You don't? Hmm? Huh? What about this one, huh? You know this woman, do you? Hmm? No, and I'd like my attorney here. I want you to look real hard, squint if you have to. Think back to 1992. You're a junior in college, and your fraternity has a party that you sponsor. And six women, all freshmen, claim they were drugged and used as party favors. Charges are filed with the university and the police, and then a week later, they're mysteriously dropped. The names and records of the complainants disappear, and then your family announces they're paying for the new football stadium! So these six women you bullied or bribed or intimidated, they were all part of the same sorority... her sorority! And I want to know if she was one of 'em! So we're gonna try this one more time. You're gonna tell me everything you did to her, all of it! And you're not leaving this this room.... What in the hell is going on in there? Your partner's losing it. He thinks Whitman's the condo raper. He asked for a lawyer about ten minutes ago. Hank doesn't seem to be in a hurry. Aw, shit! You're not leaving here till you tell me what I need to know! You want me to tell you if this woman was as at some drunken college orgy 20 years ago? She's pretty. Look, if she was there in '92, and if she looked anything like that, I promise you... I'd totally screw her. Detective! Could I see you outside for a second, please? What the hell are you doing? He's the condo rapist, Mark! That's him! That's why he was at the scene the other night. Why are you looking all crazy-eyed, man? Look, I checked him out, and he's got an ugly history with women as long as my as my dick! - That long and that ugly, huh? - And not People magazine shit. I'm talking about some disgusting stuff that his family just makes go away! Hank, how much have you had to drink today? I was waiting outside Le Chaz for this asshole for two-and-a-half hours. I might have had a little something just to fortify myself. - Jesus Christ, man! - He did to Gretchen! What? She said she didn't want to talk about it. It was in the past. Maybe that's where you should let it be, just in the past. - She's my wife, Mark. - I know that. But that's exactly the reason why you shouldn't be in here questioning this clown about anything! Look, man, look, I'll-I'll go dot, okay? I will go do it. - You do that. - I will. I'm gonna do that. But you have got to let me clean this shit up. You can't let the Captain see you like this, man. Just go home. Go home. - You got it? - I got it, man. I got it. Hey. You said you needed me? Look at this. Look. This must've got mixed in when I emptied the drawer out. Who is this guy? - I don't know him. - Well it's gotta be him. It's the guy she banged. This is the guy.. look.. If the baby comes out looking like Wolfman, I guess we'll know. Hey get rid of that, man. You don't know what this is. - That could be any... - I know I don't know! I'm trying to figure it out. I know I've never seen this guy before and here he is hanging at a bar all cozy. That's the guy, Hank, that's the guy. Hank, you gotta help me find out who it is. You gotta help me. And then what? And then I don't know! And then I talk to him! Confront the prick! Whatever! I... I need to know. Hank, I need to know. No, you don't! No, you don't, okay? That is not a road you should be going down, okay? This road leads to nowhere. - You gotta help me. - I am helping you. I'm helping you. This is from someone who's been sober for a long time. Just get drunk; get shitfaced. Just stay here. God, I'm sorry. Uh, I gotta go. Are you gonna be okay? Yeah. No, it's good. Sorry I called you down here. Oh, no, don't. Dude, just call me, and I'll come right back, okay? Please? - Yeah. - Okay, come here. Come on. Just breathe; breathe, man. Don't think bad thoughts. Don't do anything stupid, okay? All right? - You're the worst sponsor ever. - I know. I never said that, Hank. I never used that word. - You didn't need to. - I told you I had a bad experience. An experience I'd just as soon forget. Stop pressing me for details. - Why are you protecting him?! - Protecting him?! Just like he's always been protected his whole life by his family, his money, his name, his victims! I never said I was a victim. Why are you so eager to make me one? I'm not! I know this guy, Gretchen. Believe what you want, Hank. You're drunk. You're going to hear whatever you want to hear. You think I want to hear this, huh? You think I want to know what this shit heel did to you? I think, for whatever reason, you want to punish him. Don't do it because he slept with me. Do it because he's guilty. - Well he is guilty! - Okay! - Guilty as sin! - All right! You know what's funny? For something you apparently can't remember, you're trying real damn hard to forget. Well Billy Whitman... he doesn't have to try. Because he forgot about you, the second he was done. - We should've had... - Speak not. Hey. Mark wants me to bring you both back to observation. So, what's this I hear about you ripping open old wounds, Hank? Just trying to put a period on it, Reynolds. Yeah? Well, with you it's always an exclamation point. Heard we got another one. Yeah, Caldwell's bringing her over from County now. You want me to take her statement? Ah, we already did. She agreed to do a lineup. Of what? Guys in ski masks? It's a voice lineup, Reynolds. Why don't you hop in there between, uh, Sanchez and Morrison. Yeah. Think there are enough guys in there? Maybe I should jump in, too. Oh, I don't want you in there with that guy. You'd end up pointing your finger at him. Just let me handle this, okay? All right. Now, this is more about listening than it is about looking. Okay? The men back there, they can't see you. If any of these men sound like the guy that attacked you, you let us know, okay? Okay. Number one, please repeat the phrase. Get on your knees, bitch. Scream and I'll kill you. - Number two. - Get on your knees, bitch. Scream and I'll kill you. - No. - Number three. Get on your knees, bitch. Scream and I'll kill you. - No. - Number four. Get on your knees, bitch. Scream and I'll kill you. No. Number five. Get on your knees, bitch. Scream and I'll kill you. I'm... trying. I really want to help. I don't want you to just pick one, all right? Now, if none of these men sound like the man... Can I hear number two again? Do you mean second from the right... number four? No. Number two. - Number two, repeat the phrase. - Get on your knees, bitch. Scream and I'll kill you. That does sound like it could be him. I can't be sure. You did very well. Okay? Thank you. Thank you, gentlemen. Okay, that's it. Everybody out. Wanted to thank y'all for agreeing to come down. Oh, just try not to waste my time. Yeah, I wouldn't think of it. My client has agreed to listen to your questions. I will be advising him on whether or not he should answer any of them. Well, I'm really not going to ask too many questions. I'm just going to share some information, and you can react to that as you will. Now, some new information has come to light. Some developments. Evidence. I hope it's better than the so-called evidence you had three years ago. - Okay, what's up? - So, where were you tonight, Hank? Uh... I'm... I was... I'm pretty sure I was at home. Isn't that where I was at when you got me? Right. Yeah. Please, uh. that's for him. Okay, Hank, Hank... make sure you drink this coffee, okay? I wasn't even on duty tonight, Mark. I had a few drinks. I let loose a little. - Yeah, well, how loose? - What the hell is going on, man? How come you got me in here? Listen, I-I got you in here so we don't make a mistake, okay? For both of our sakes. Just tell me where were you tonight? - Uh, Corky's. - Okay. And, um... God, can't we just do this tomorrow? Yeah, well, you know, we might. Billy Whitman was in an accident tonight, Hank. Well, good. Whoo! Some good news. I hope he's dead. No, no. Hank, before we go any further... okay? As your friend, as your partner, I am suggesting that you get your union rep here. Maybe even a lawyer. You think I did something to Whitman? Somebody ran him off the road, Hank. Well, good for them. Tell me who they are, man. I'll buy them a drink. It sure as hell wasn't me, Mark. - Where did you go after Corky's? - Uh... I imagine I went to my home. Probably not, though. I don't know. - Did you black out? - I don't think I blacked out. I mean... I don't remember. I sure as hell didn't see black, though. I see black now. Black coffee. So, how is Billy Whitman? He didn't have a chance to rape somebody tonight? His head hit the steering wheel. Knocked him unconscious. They treated him, released him. Did he see who did it? Nope. Found some interesting things in his trunk, though. Ski mask. Length of rope. Electrical tape. Great. So you found his rape kit. No, we found the shit that somebody planted there. How do you know that? Because an hour before, he got a flat. He called BMW roadside assistance... They came. The technician was in that trunk, Hank. He said he didn't see any of that stuff in there, so somebody must have planted it. So I'm going to ask you one more time: Do you want a lawyer? He's in there, isn't he? I don't want you to talk anymore, man. Do I have the right to remain silent, Mark? You don't have the ability to remain silent. Who's he in there with? His high-priced mouthpiece? Kasabian, the mayor, maybe? You know what, you need to shut the hell up right now. You want to know if I planted shit in Whitman's trunk? The answer is no. That's a sure-as-shit fact. And I'll tell you who did... Whitman did. He planted his own shit in his trunk, okay? He flattened his tire, he got a prior witness, he ran himself off the road or he paid someone to do it, planted the shit in his trunk to set me up, and you want to know why? Huh, Mark? 'Cause he knows I'm on to him! - Hank, sit down! - I'm coming for you! Sit down, Hank! I'm coming after you, you son of a bitch! I'm on to you, man! He'll be gone by the end of the week. - He better be. - Am I under arrest or what? This is bullshit. Now, I'm not going to even ask if these look familiar to you. They're just an unremarkable pair of women's undergarments. They're not from any of the rapes up here. I actually got them from the evidence lockup in a totally different jurisdiction. From a string of rapes in Temecula. Now, we believe it's the same perpetrator. We also believe that the rapes in Temecula occurred before he had time to perfect his M.O. So, come Monday, these panties... Well, they're going to get dropped off at the DNA lab. And I am sure that they're going to come back with your joy juices all over them. Okay. Detective, that's enough. If there's any reason why you think you should plead out right now... you'll get a better deal than you will come Tuesday. - He's one cool customer. - Yep. Hey, can you give these to Gina, have her sign them back into evidence for me? - Sure thing. - All right. Think he took the bait? You tell me. You were watching. Guess we'll have to wait and see. Hey, you go to school with Katie Nichols? - Yeah. - She your girlfriend? - Who are you? - Hey, do me a favor, smile for me. Why? Hey. You wanted the rest of these old vic statements? That's right. Hey, um, why don't you do me a favor and come in and close the door. So you think this guy's really gonna take a deal? I don't see why he should. Would you? If I were innocent? Hell, no. - What are you talking about? - Whitman's not the guy, Reynolds. Never was. What do you mean? Apparently, the guy that we're looking for, well... He's a cop. A cop? Mm-hmm. Since when? Since this morning, when a journalist named Laura Ross came to me and told me it was you. Me? Ronnie, why don't you just go ahead and have a seat. And keep your hands where I can see them. Mark, this is crazy. Three years ago, you were nearly identified in a lineup by a victim. You panicked. You knew how I was leaning on Whitman. So you ran him off the road and you planted that rape kit in his trunk. You hitting the bottle again, Hank? No. If I hadn't back then, maybe I would have seen it clearly, maybe not. Maybe I was too close. Maybe I'd still have my job. Maybe I'd still have my marriage. But Laura Ross saw it. She pointed out some really interesting things. The perp knew exactly how to cover his tracks. He knew exactly what we needed to look for. That suggests law enforcement. And guess who consistently was the first officer on the scene every time. You. - So? - So... Just one more time. Just so we're clear. He told me to get down on my knees. You aren't about the rape. You're about reliving it, by making the victim recount to your face the very things you did to them. Come on, Mark. You are not buying this load, are you? At first, I didn't. Let me ask you something. Before you got here, where did you train? - Temecula. - Temecula. We found the rapes in Temecula, Ronnie And they started right after you were hired for your other career... being a cop. - That doesn't prove anything. - Maybe not, but this does. That's you 15 minutes ago in the evidence lockup, destroying the very piece of evidence that you were convinced pointed the finger directly at you. - It's not real evidence. - It is now. Fellas. Read him his rights, take him to the interrogation room. I want a lawyer. Well, did you get your man, detective? Appears we have. Thanks for doing this. Gets a rapist off the streets, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It was a decent thing to do. Yeah. Well, I'm a decent guy. She, however, charges by the hour. She'll be billing you for the time. Gentlemen. We owe it to you, Laura. Guess this gets you out from under the cloud. Yeah, sunshine from now on. Need to catch up with him. Thank you. No, thank you. Mm-hmm. Well, it looks like we finally got it right. Laura got it right. I had the wrong guy. I did too. Mark, until tonight... I didn't know myself what I did three years ago. Hey, listen. I'm kind of new to sobriety. But I know I owe you an amends. When we worked together, I was completely out of control and... I'm sorry. You were a great partner. Thank you. Thank you. - Talk to Gustafson, man! - Aw, shit. Talk to Gustafson! Hank! Hey, man, what are you doing here? Hey, guess what. I got the Wolfman. I got him, baby! Get off me. Weasel! Mark! - Got to find out what's going on. - Assault, battery. Pretty serious shit. He could've killed the kid. But he didn't. That's the only thing he got going for him. - Hey, I'll give you five minutes, okay? - Thanks, Mark. What's up, tough guy? Aw, hell... I took your advice. Keep drinking. That was just half of my advice. You beat that kid pretty good. Oh, yeah, he had it coming. No, he didn't. He wasn't the guy. What? The kid you pummeled, she didn't sleep with him. What are you talking about? - How do you know? - Cause I know. Cause I've known. Because Katie told me. When? When it first happened. She didn't know what to do, so she came to me. No! She was desperate. She hated herself, she made a mistake, she made a grievous goddamn mistake. She was lost and she didn't want to lose you, so I told her not to tell you. - What? Why would you say that? - Because I didn't want to lose you! Because I knew what you would do! And look what you did, man! And look where you're at! You should've just listened to me and walked away! You walk away. Walk away, Hank. Walk away from me. Just walk away, Hank. - Look, I... - I don't give a shit! Walk away! - I'm sorry... - Get out of here! All right, eeny meeny miny moe. Scooter, free to go. You. - Me? - Come on. - Cool. - Open two. Hey, listen... if you remember anything more about last night, give me a call, all right? Huh. What do I call you? Detective Dolwoh. Hank. Hank. Right on. Hey, what about the other guy? Asshole with the Beemer. I handled him. What were you doing out there stuck without a ride, anyway? Oh, no, I had a ride. Dude just bailed on me. Sounds like it's time for you to get a new partner. - Yeah. - In a new line of work. Hey. I hope you catch this guy, man. We will. In time.
