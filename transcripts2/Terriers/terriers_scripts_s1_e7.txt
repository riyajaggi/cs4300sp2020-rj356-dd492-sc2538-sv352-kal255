 Terriers (2010): Season 1, Episode 7 - Missing Persons - full transcript 
 Hank insists to take the case of a student who can't even remember his identity and fears to have committed some horror. Britt, who can't make head or tail of Maggie's aloof attitude, protests once more to be the 'partner' whose vote doesn't count, yet agrees to help the boy. His peril recalls to Hank his sister Katie's, which is demonstrated again when she befriends an imaginary, 'neglected' neighbor girl. The duo works out their client is student Adam Fisher, whose crush went out of hand due to malaria medication's psychotic side effects, but he now is in actual trouble, even suicidal.

 Previously on Terriers... Tonight is karaoke night. Baby, you should totally go. Hey, Katie. Are you going to join us? Have fun, flirt with your teacher, get that GPA up. Two Long Islands.

 I pretty much know what's coming next. But that's what you want. What's wrong with me? Why, Hank, when everything's, like, so perfect? Deep down inside, you, you, you just don't feel like you deserve it. - I'm gonna lose him. - You're gonna lie to him. This never happened. He can never know about this. Hey! Hey. Hi, Hank. Why didn't you just tell me you were here? I didn't want to be a bother. This is my sister Steph.

 Steph, this is Britt. He's my partner. Steph's been living with me for a few weeks apparently. Why'd you leave St. John's? I thought you liked it there. Got tired of the ward. All the people there are crazy. When Steph's on her meds, she's unbelievable. She's brilliant, funny, loyal, but when the meds aren't in balance, it's a handful. The doctor gave Steph generics. Steph doesn't react to it as well. What are we going have tomorrow night? I don't know, I was thinking maybe lobster thermidor. Hmm? Maybe some coq au vin. Of course, I would have to skip out on the vin. Well, you'll just the coq, then. You kiss your mother with that mouth? Why? No reason. The first couple years, we would cook for each other. Made a point to light candles, the whole megillah, and then after that, it seemed like a homemade meal was more, you know, reserved for a special occasion, and then the last year before I moved out, I really can't remember us eating together here once. Same with the sex? That's none of your beeswax. You little bitch. I do two things well, Steph. The other thing, and making you cry. Oh. I slave away all day to put food on the table for you kids, and... Nobody throwing me a parade! That's him... that's the bad guy right there. What? This show is always the same. Okay? It's always the guy who hires him. Shh, don't don't don't tell me that. You think it's that dude, but in 5 minutes... Mom, Hank's ruining the TV show! La-la-la-la-la! I got some ice cream. You want a mug or a bowl? Mug, please. Chocolate with sprinkles? Mom, you want ice cream? Frankly, I didn't. Mom. She's doing good otherwise, though, yeah? Yeah, she's really settling in. I mean, she's still got the little things going on. You know, like on Wednesday she took all her toilet paper and she made a papiem?ch? sculpture of Mont Saint-Michel. But she's always been a creative type. Wait, Mont Saint what? It's a French cathedral. It was built in the, uh, something-something century. How's that... wiping your ass with a cathedral? An ecclesiastical delight. Hey, give me two bits. Thanks. Hey, this paper's free. Yeah, it is. You all alright? You seem distracted. It's Katie, man. I keep... She's acting weird, you know. I think she might have found the engagement ring. - Really? - Yeah. I don't know how, man. I've moved it, like, four times now. I'm so paranoid that she senses it around, like it's giving off a signal, you know? Like it's a beating heart under the floorboards? Yeah. - That's a reference to... - Edgar Allan Poe. I'm not a complete idiot. Not complete. She hasn't said anything to you, has she, about finding it? No, no. Whoa, hey, Carter, what's all the rumpus, man? The health inspector finally make his way into your kitchen? God forbid. Some drifter kid wandered in. He was grazing the tables. Ramon tries to shoo him out. Shit fit ensues. Proceeds to lock himself in the bathroom. Huey's bladder can't weather this much longer. What's the problem, Huey? Just use the ladies' room. I don't pee sitting down. Sounds like he's tweaking. You guys call the cops? I was about to. Which means what, half an hour? Probably. Hey, Carter, we'll do you a deal. We'll get the kid out... free breakfast. Fine. Free breakfast for two weeks. One week. And no steak and eggs. Think he's in there flogging it? Hey, man, what's up? Open up, I gotta change those towels. What's going on, man? Is it... is it like this, do you think? Or... Or should I...? Is it, is it like this? I can't... I can't tell. You know, 'cause-'cause I don't... I don't know. I'm supposed to know, but I don't know. And I... I just... I don't know why. Do you guys know who I am? 'Cause I got no idea. Incoming. Sync & corrections by honeybunny ReSync for 720p CTU by Alex1969 www.addic7ed.com Hey, hey, hey, you were supposed to get him out of here, Hank. Relax, Carter. Be a human being, okay? Let him have some French toast... collect himself. Okay, his ain't free, Alright, kid, get some food in you. It'll do you good. - Thanks. - Alright, so you got no money, no ID, and can't even remember your own name. You're not some CIA-trained assasin gone rogue, are you? See, that's the problem with amnesiacs... they don't get the movie references. All right, kid, what's the last thing you remember? Where'd you wake up this morning? I don't remember waking up. I remember a car honking at me and some guy yelling at me to get out of the street. What about before that? I mean, nothing. How can there be nothing? It's okay. It's okay. I can't tell you how many times I woke up not knowing where I was. I know where I am. I don't know who I am. We're in Florida, right? San Diego... California. Interesting fact about San Diego, California. Highest concentration of palm trees anywhere in the country, including Montana. Wait, they have palm trees in Montana? Okay, see, you remember some things. Let's check your pockets. I told you, I don't... I don't have any wallet or anything. That's all right. Just for the hell of it, let's go through all of them. The corners, the lint, jacket, pants, everything. I got like a buck 50. What's this? You know what this is? No. No idea. Maybe I'm a drug addict. Hey, you fellas know what you want? Yeah, Doris, we'll have three country breakfasts. And his social security number, please. Don't worry, kid. We're going to help you figure out what's going on with you, I promise. - Hey, hey, what are you doing? - Getting change. The breakfast is free, the service isn't. That's not what I'm talking about. We're not an adoption agency. I thought his story had a ring of truth to it. The story doesn't have a story. Look at him, man, he's not a bum. He's dressed quite the opposite. Wherever he's from, I'm sure his people would love to have him back. There might even be a big, fat reward in it for us. Half court shot at best, and you know it. And what's this about, dude? Really? That kid... he's... he's the same age Steph was when she started. She was going to college, getting straight "A's." One morning she just walked out of class. Was gone for six days. No one noticed for two. So let's just not abandon this kid just yet. So, no one matching your description has been reported missing. So no one's looking for me. It hasn't been 24 hours. Kid, you see that sign right there? What's that say? It says "Deli." What color is that lifeguard station? It's white. Who's the president of the United States? See, this is what I'm saying, man. There's some things you can remember and some things you can't. It's like, clearly you can read, right? From the looks of you, you probably know some algebra. Where's the dividing line between shit you just know and shit you can remember? The mind... not unlike your sock drawer... is a complicated place. Maybe we should ask Doc Johnson. That guy's a doctor? He used to be a pharmacist until he got popped dipping into his own inventory. Now the only scrips he writes are for Rocky Road. Get high off your own supply. - Tennyson. - Wordsworth. What's up, Ill-Humored Man? What's good today? Try a Chipwich. They're fresh from the freezer. No, thank you. Actually, I have a question for you, Doctor. Can you tell me what the hell this is? It belongs to my friend here, and he's got a serious case of the I-don't-know-who-the-hell-I-ams. You guys want something? Sno-cone, ice-cream sandwich? I'm good. Thanks. Can I get a Push-Up? Remembers he likes Push-Ups. There you go. Was he planning on taking a trip somewhere? Far East, Africa, maybe? I don't know. Why? It's Prelid... antimalarial drug. Lots of people take it before they go on vacation. Would that explain his amnesia? Possible side effects include depression, anxiety, paranoia, aggression, delusion and memory loss. About the only thing it doesn't give you is malaria. What day was the attack on Pearl Harbor? December 7, 1941. What's your favorite beer? No idea. What's the capital of California? Sacramento. No. El Centro. Well, hey, thanks, Doc, for the consultation. How much do I owe you? No, no, consultation's on the house. $2.50 for the Push-Up. - So how long is it supposed to last? - Doc says a day...You know, maybe two. You sure you have no memory of planning a trip? Maybe going to a safari, a trip to Thailand, I mean... Look, do you know if you are straight or gay? Straight, I think... Well, the good news is, now we know what cleans your slate. So we just got to wait it out, man. Yeah, for a few days. And then, I mean, what if it doesn't wear off? What if I'm an amnesiac the rest of my life? Relax. Paranoia's one of the side effects of this thing, too. Just don't let your thoughts, you know, run away from you, you know? Okay, but how do I know? I've had a feeling all day that I did something wrong. I'm, I'm guilty of something, and, I mean, what-what if I'm on the run here? Look, take a deep deep breath. I'm sure the worst crime you've ever committed is wearing white after Labor Day. I'm gonna give you my cell phone number, all right? Call it if you need anything: get in trouble, whatever, okay? Here... 15 bucks; a little walking-around money. I'm sure in a few hours, you're gonna be right as rain. Give me a call if you want. That's great. I'll just, I'll stay here, sweat it out by myself. Great. Appreciate it, Mark. Ah, man, it's been almost six hours since we booked anyone around here. You know, my boys, they need to practice. Do you want us to print some flyers for you or anything? If it's not a hassle. How about some 8 x 10s and some wallet-size? Hank Dolworth: friends of the meek, the poor and the huddled. My selflessness abounds. What's wrong with you, man? You don't like doing pro bono work? You do this when you guys were partners? Pick up strays? Only every other day. So is there anything else I can do for you gentleman? I mean, host a car wash in the parking lot to help raise awareness? You know, Mark, now that you mention it, you can run his prints just in case. Could you scan his prints? Post 9/11, it's just SOP. Now, listen, this doesn't look like a bad kid. Do you think he's up to something? - No, but he does. - Alright. If he comes up wanted, you know we gotta keep him. I don't know, I don't know. I got a real busy day. So can I just call you? When I get home from school... Well you want me to pick something up or you wanna go out to eat I mean, you gotta eat something babe. Look, I don't know. I can't even think about that yet. I don't know what to tell you. Maybe we could go out to dinner. I'll-I'll take you somewhere nice. Yeah, that's sweet, and I'm just gonna leave that up to you. What time do you expect you're gonna be home? Okay! Yeah. Yeah-yeah-yeah. All right, I'll talk to you, I'll talk to you later. Bye. What if we can't I.D. this kid? What are you gonna do, take him home with you? Maybe. Hey, you know what, man? I got an idea. Let's have a vote. All those in favor of dumping the kid say "aye." Aye. All those in favor of not dumping the kid say "nay." Nay! Hey, what are you doing? I'm having a vote! Uh, so that's one vote in favor of dumping him, one vote in favor of not dumping him. And guess who wins. You do. What's this all about? Dude, this is supposed to be a partnership. But does it matter? Because every time we have a disagreement about something, you win; you always do. It doesn't matter what I say. And you know, you got a real bad habit of doing shit and telling me about it later. I'm just telling you I'm sick of it! - Oh, yeah? - Yeah! Where's this coming from?! Because it seems like it's been stored up for a while! You know something, Hank? I don't know how long it's been stored up, but it's there. I'm telling you I'm over it. I'm sick of having to always do whatever the hell it is that you want to do. And-and Katie, I can't get, I can't get through to her, dude! I don't know what's going on! It's like she's completely distant. And I don't know what the hell it is that I'm supposed to do! What do you want from me?! Look, listen... if I've treated you... like anything other than a full partner, I'm sorry. And I will, I will be more respectful about that, okay? And about this kid, what's-his-name? I don't give a shit. We can drop him off at any halfway house you want. Forget it, man. It's not about the kid. I'm sorry. I know! I know. You got a lot on your plate right now. And I just run around, act reflexively, and I promise I'll be better about that too. - Hey, don't patronize me, Hank. - I'm not patronizing you. I'm a bit condescending towards you, sure. I'm kidding, man. It's cool man, it's just... It's Katie, man. She won't even look me in the eye anymore. Maybe you two should talk to a professional, - like one of those counselors... - Your John Doe hit Robledo in the nose! What? Where the hell is he?! The little shit took off! What the hell happened? I finish printing the kid, he sees something on the bulletin board, starts freaking the hell out. I try and calm him down, he pops me, took off. The kid did that? I need to know what was right here! What was right here! Yes, sir. There's no sign of him on the street. What is that? Jessica Sampson, a missing college student. This is a fresh case. How fresh? She went missing 36 hours ago. Guess your John Doe does have something to feel guilty about. Jessica Sampson, 20. We swept her dorm room for two days straight. Took statements from her friends, her family. No solid leads. Nothing in this girl's description matches. Maybe he didn't even know her, Mark. Who know what's going through that kid's mind? Yeah, that's true. That stuff he took? One of the side effects is delusions. Well, you know that stuff you found on the kid? The antimalarial? You have any idea what else it's used for? - What are you talking about? - Sometimes it's used for a roofie. So you're saying everyone who goes to Bangkok gets roofied first? In some dosages, yeah. So he roofied the girl and then dosed himself? Maybe he gave it to the girl, and this whole "Where am I, who am I?" the whole shit's just an act. So then he let me bring him down here to get mugged and printed? I have no idea what kind of head games that this kid is playing right here. - I looked into his eyes. - Oh, you did? You looked into his eyes? Well, Hank, please tell me, what did you see, his soul? If you are contacted by this kid, you send him straight to me, you understand? If you get this itch to play social worker, you tamp that shit down. Let me handle it, okay? Thank you, thank you, thank you. You're welcome. - You don't think he did it? - I don't think it's in him. Why'd he freak out? Well, whatever, it's in Gusto's hands now. Let's go get a taco. Where's your school spirit? We got two missing persons. Come on. Hey, listen, as much as I love the idea of saving a damsel in distress, we don't got monkey shit to go on. Yeah, we do. You swipe that? It's the Sampson's girl's roommate's statement. You wouldn't want to go investigate Hush Off-Campus Housing with me, would you? Ah, probably not. Just a bunch of hot college girls running around. A man's gotta work. Let's go, partner. Oh! I'm sorry! You startled me. - I'm the sister. - I'm sorry. You're Gretchen's sister? Hank's. I'm Steph. I didn't know Mr. Dolworth had a sister. Come to think of it, I don't know that much about Mr. Dolworth at all. - How is Gretchen? - She's marrying Jason. What are those? Uh, delphinium. They take a lot of maintenance, but I'm telling ya they're worth every minute. They're the loveliest thing I've ever seen. The Friendlys live over there. Friendlys? Ed and Barbara... and their daughter. She's having fun. - I'll check the mailboxes. - All right. Hey, do you know where we can find Didi? Who are you guys? I'm just here for the, for the... fix the thing. She's in 34. Thank you. Thanks. And I'm in 28. Kind of wishing I'd showed up for the SATs. You know what they say about college girls, don't you? They're young, dumb and full of scholarly ambition. - I wanted to say something else. - Oh, shoot. Uh, you guys aren't cops, are you? - No. - Easy, Hannah Montana. Yeah, it's just they've been around a lot lately. Cops. Since her trip. Look, we don't wanna harshmellow or whatever you guys say these days, - but we wanna ask you about... - About Jess? Private investigators. Parents hired us. Look, Jess and I are just roommates. We're not friends or anything. - She wasn't fun. - Do you know if she had a boyfriend? A really pale, kind of small dude? - Run around here, she did. - You mind if we take a look through her things? Was Jessica into, uh, Eastern religions and culture? Hmm? Oh, ah, I think that was her major. Oh, hey, yeah, dude, I know about this stuff. Confucius say, "Man who walk backwards through turnstile is going to Bangkok." That's hilarious. I'm gonna tweet that. Was she planning a trip to Cambodia? Uh, yeah, I guess. She was talking about it on the phone. - With who? - I'm not a friggin' secretary. Guess what the medical section says. Uh, don't go to Cambodia. "Use antimalarial drugs." To Cambodia? Hey, who knows the airport code? Phnom Penh International. "PNH." Try Cambodia Airlines. Try Cambodia Airlines, huh? Thanks, Kissinger. Right, just gotta wave a dead chicken over the site source code, hop the encryption. Shouldn't take more than a minute. - Have Swift tell you about his lady problems. - Shit! Damn it! Why are Finnish people so freakin' good at Halo III?! What's up with your girl, dude? Oh, yeah. I was up with this chick Helena, like, three times. Boom! Yeah, right? But last time, I realized she doesn't even know my name. Hey, what's she screaming out when she's climaxing, huh? Hippocratic Oath? T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland. No, both wrong. She recited the first eight numbers of the Fibonacci Sequence. "Oh, my God! Oh! "0, 1, 1, "2, 3, 5, 8, 13!" Yeah, great, really funny. Keep laughing. It's like sleeping with a graphing calculator that's on the fritz. Oh! Got it! Check this out! Air Cambodia flight from San Diego to Phnom Penh via Honolulu yesterday at 4:00 p.m. Did anyone miss the flight? Uh... yeah. Uh, one Jessica Sampson and one Adam Fisher. Did they purchase their tickets on the same day? No. Two weeks apart. But they were purchased on the same credit card, belonging to a Mr. Harold Fisher. You guys can do that, track credit cards and shit? Yeah. How do you think we support this lifestyle? Hey, you guys want an address for this Fisher dude? - Hi. - Oh, hi, Steph. - You're low. - I beg your pardon, honey? Your tire... it's low. Tire pressure measures pounds per square inch. Low tire pressure could result in overheating and treads operation. Thank you. - I'll get it checked. - Which could lead to an accident. Ow. Are you okay? I'm okay. You want me to take a look? Just a scrape. - Does it hurt? - Nah. You should've seen when I fell off the slide. That hurt. Where are your parents? My mom's sleeping. My dad's... I don't really know where my dad is. Should you be out here by yourself? Should you? - What's your name? - Elle. What's yours? - Steph. - Do you want to play with me? - For a little bit. - Catch me! Okay. Okay, so, definitely not homeless. Looks like Mr. and Mrs. Fisher are out of town. Yeah. Go ahead. Adam? Adam? Hello? Are you here, buddy? Adam? Kid's a dreamer. Traveler, a loner. Ah, well, I feel much better now. He was so quiet. Kept to himself. We were all so shocked when he came out wearing his mother's skin. He's not a freak. Uh, you sure about that? You think he found his way home? Adam? Is that you, man? It's Hank. We're here to help. Jessica. It's okay. It's okay. Call Mark. You're safe. So how's the girl doing? Pretty stoked not to be taped up in a basement, I can tell you that. Well, I'll send a couple of guys after her to see what she knows, okay? - She liked the kid, Mark. - She said that? Ah, they were in a couple of the same classes, she had a study group. They were friends. She said he was a nice kid. She still can't believe he'd do something like this. Well, I guess she was wrong. The kid was planning a trip to Cambodia, wanted to see the temple at Angkor Wat. - Angkor what? - It's an old Khmer ruin. Okay, so he buys his ticket for the 16th, he starts taking his course of antimalarials about two weeks before. About a week into it, he buys a second ticket. He's delusional. He's convinced she's gonna be thrilled... this girl that he's crushing on... when he surprises her with it. Yeah, except she's not thrilled. She said thanks but no thanks, you know. So he snaps, and because it's not in his nature to do the thing he's done he disassociates, wakes up in the middle of the street. I hope a jury sees it the same way. This is my room. It's awesome. Thanks. - Are you sure it's okay? - What do you mean? You really shouldn't let strangers into the house. You're not a stranger. I am to your folks. They don't care. Here, I'm gonna color in this one. You can have any of these other ones you want. You don't stay in the lines. Hardly ever. Me either. You okay? You ever have one of those nightmares where you do something so terrible you know you can never take it back? Yeah, sure. When you wake up, you're so relieved. Imagine waking up into a nightmare like that. Well, his nightmare could've been lot worse, man, if it weren't for you. You know, if we didn't get here in time. Oh, it's late. I got to get to a pharmacy before it closes to pick up Steph's meds. Steph? You up there? Hey, Hank. Hey. I made friends today. Did you? Guess what time it is. Fezabrine tea time? Fantastic. Getting to know the neighbors, huh? Mm-hmm. I helped Mrs. Eames. She has some beautiful delphinium. Those are those blue and lavender flowers. Her tire was low, so I told her. Mrs. Eames. Is she the lady next door? Mm-hmm. I met Elle, the little girl across the street. We played. God, you know the neighbors better than I do. You're making me look bad. I think you should talk to her parents, Hank. They let her play unsupervised. Mrs. Eames? Are her parents still alive? Elle's parents, dork-o. Finish that whole mug. I'm serious, hank. - Hello? - You were wrong. You told me everything is gonna be ok, but it's not. Adam. Where are you? That's what they keep calling me on the news... Adam. I don't remember any of at. I remember other stuff, though. Listen, Adam, whatever you did, it wasn't you. I don't want to be me. Adam's a monster. Adam, where are you? - Is she gonna live? - Hank. I need to know. I think her parents are home. You should go talk to them. Is she gonna live? Listen, Adam, yeah. Yeah, the girl's gonna be fine. More importantly is: where are you? You must give her a message, okay? Tell her I'm so sorry. I'm gonna take care of the asshole who did this to her... me. No, Adam, don't. Adam! Shit. Can I help you? I need to talk to you about your daughter. - My daughter? - Elle. I'm afraid you have the wrong house. Elle... hey! What is it, Barbara? - It's okay, Dad, I got it. - No, where is she? Elle! There's no one here by that name, I'm sorry! - Elle? - What... Dad, call 911. Hello. Uh, Detective Mark Gustafson, please. Yeah, can you tell him it's an emergency? No. No. This is where we colored together. No! No. No. No, damn you! No, no, no, no, no! Did he give any indication where he was calling from? No, but I get the sinking feeling he's gonna cast himself as King Kong and hope the OBPD plays the airplanes. - Hold on. - No. No! No, no! I told you. I told you! I told you! I told you, I told... I told you, I told you. I told you. I told you! I told you! - I told you, I told you... - Oh, shit, I got to go. Steph! Down those. I lost her, Hank. - Baby, I don't think she... - I know. She was never there. I'm not getting better, am I? Just try to rest. It's not like before. There was no blood this time. I'll be right back. - Hey. - Hey. You okay? Yeah. She was hallucinating, huh? Hallucinating and light gardening, but she's better now. Yeah, can I go see her? Yeah, she'd love that.. She's in my room. Hey, kid called me... Adam. - No shit. - Yeah. Hey. It's me and Hank when we were kids. That was a long time ago. Are you really there? Yeah. Yeah, I'm really here. Good. Well, you got to figure, if the kid reached out to you, it means he wants help. Didn't sound that way. It's Gustafson. Hello. Yeah. Okay. They found the kid. He did it again. Campus security was called 25 minutes ago. When they got here, the kid started carrying on about how he was gonna shoot the roommate... Didi... unless they went in there to stop him. I doubt he even has a gun. Hey, that's not for me to guess. I got to prepare for the worst, okay? The girl seemed convinced. Well, she's also probably tweaking on Bolivian marching powder, man. Not the most reliable source. What do you need us to do? Well, you've been friends with the kid the whole day, which makes you his oldest friend. Figure he trusts you more than he trusts us. So why don't you go in there, and say hello, try to talk some sense into the kid. If anything goes wrong, back off and let us handle it. Adam. What's going on, buddy? It's me... Hank Dolworth. I'll kill her. I swear to God. Where'd you get the gun? Stole it. From where? I'm coming in. Hank, no way. I already saved one girl today. Why not go for two? If you go in there, I can't protect you, okay? You're not going to need to. I'm coming in. - Hank... - Adam. Adam, come on. - Leave. - What are you doing, man? - Leave. - Just put the gun down. I'll use it. They'll have to come in and stop me. What were you going to do with this, huh? What?! You going to drown her? You really don't have any idea what you're doing, do you? If you want them to shoot you, you don't fill it with water first. You, get out. Get out. Close the door behind you. - No, no, no. - Not you, not you. You sit down. This is where... this is where she lived. This is all... this is all her stuff. You had a crush on her, man. That's normal. Normal! Those pills you took... they made you do what you did. You don't know that. You don't know it. There's something inside me... the pills made me... it just brought it out. - Bullshit. - I'm sick. - I'm crazy. - You are not crazy! You're not crazy! You want to see crazy? I'll show you crazy, 'cause I know it. Now listen to me, man. You do not get to do this! There are people out there who have a kind of crazy that will never go away. And they have to keep on living. And what happened to you is going to pass. So stop being a selfish prick and pull yourself together. You got it?! I didn't mean it. I didn't mean to hurt her. I know you didn't. I know. Go get better. So we done saving people today? Once more over Metropolis. I think you're talking about Gotham City. Hey, wait, does that mean, I'm...? Boy Wonder. I am not a sidekick, dude. You're my man Friday. Hey. Thanks, Katie. You were a little brat. And someone hit you with an ugly stick. I was an angel. You were an angel. You always took care of me. I want to take care of you. But I'm not ready. Think you can let me go for a little while? - You okay? - Yeah. - Huh? - Yeah. Hey, did you...? Yeah. That's what I thought. How's school? Um, it's fine. I'm doing, um... Ethics and Euthanasia. What's that? It's when we put animals to sleep. That's horrible. Wait, hey, where you going? I got to shower. Okay, well, just so you know, you might get dirty in a second. I just got to... I'm going to recharge. You know how I do it. I got to recharge my batteries and I'll be two minutes. I love you! It's a nice place, you know? I get my own room, good food. It's not like St. John's. It's not a hospital. It's assisted living. They have amenities... a pool. You don't think I can take care of you? Hank, you are. You're paying for it. It's nothing. I had some money put away. Yeah, bearer bonds in the wall. That was weird. We can make it work, Steph, I know we can. Games... look, they have shuffleboard. You love shuffleboard. We can play when you come to visit. You're gonna be ok? You can do this. If you wind up hating this place, you got to tell me. We'll figure something else out. I promise. And you have to promise to come visit. A lot. Not like when I was at St. John's. Promise. Just be sure to call first.
