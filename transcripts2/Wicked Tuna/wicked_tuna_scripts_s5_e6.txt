 NARRATOR: Wicked Tuna. At the start of week six, last season's champion Hard Merchandise leads the fleet. While Pinwheel and Wicked Pissah, who have both lost their mates have fallen behind the rest of the rod and reel boats. And harpoon boat Kristiana has a handy lead over rival, Lily. [beeping] SANDRO: Ah, dude, all over your down rod. Wow. [beeping] DAVE: They're in here. [beeping] Come on, dude, we're gonna get a bite here. SANDRO: I'd love to catch one. DAVE: My goal, as always, is the same-- to be the top boat in the fleet. We have a lot of work to do to get there. And this week, it's just Sandro and I. Look at that. SANDRO: Is there three? DAVE: Alright, let's get ready. I loaned my mate Geordie to Paul on the Wicked Pissah, 'cause he still doesn't have a crew. He only gets Geordie for one week. [beeping] SANDRO: Oh, my God. 80 feet now. DAVE: Me helping Paul out now will lead to him helping me out in the future. SANDRO: Going down. Looks almost like the same mark. [beeping] DAVE: I just hope that doesn't come back to bite me in the ass. SANDRO: Oh, my God, he's all over it. DAVE: Got him, got him. Oh, yeah. Right, there we go! There we go! Yes, sir! Come on, come on, baby. Come on, get it in there. SANDRO: It's on! Yeah, baby! Woo! We're running around, we're trying to clear all the other lines; we got to get off this anchor. I kind of miss Geordie right now. I didn't get off the anchor yet. DAVE: I know, I know. Get that one rod up. SANDRO: I'm clear. Go, baby, yeah, woo-hoo! Wow, we're on. Wow, that'd probably give us two or three of them on the machine. DAVE: You ready? ♪ ♪ Could be in for a long battle, hate for something to spoil this big fish right here. SANDRO: Big boy, oh, yeah. DAVE: Oh, yeah. SANDRO: No way. DAVE: No way. SANDRO: You got to be [bleep] kidding me. DAVE: What the [bleep]?! This is not the way I wanted to start this trip. Un-[bleep]-believable. SANDRO: Why do I do this for a living? This is stupid. DAVE: We just can't afford to lose any more fish. SANDRO: [bleep] joke, dude. PAUL: It's so, so hard to have people that are really good. Having Geordie on the boat is like having three other guys with me. He's very good, very smart, loves fishing. Almost two weeks ago... LANCE: I ask you one simple thing and you flip the [bleep] out. PAUL: This is my boat. I'm the captain, I'm the boss, and that's that. BRAD: That's just bad. PAUL: My mates, Brad and Lance, quit. PAUL: You should have said something like a man. And last week, I went fishing by myself and I didn't catch anything. I just lost him. [bleep] It's upstanding by him to do that. Give up one of his guys for me? I don't know if he wants to know what I'm doing. [laughs] Mates come and go all the time, but you know the people that are in it to win it, you know? GEORDIE: This whole situation is, is almost surreal. Paul's got a reputation of being tough to work with. He's been driving his mates away. I think that's proof that he is a really hard character to work for. PAUL: Hey, Geordie, here you go. To make it official. GEORDIE: Yeah, here you go. PAUL: Team player. GEORDIE: Payday. PAUL: See? [laughs] Yeah! GEORDIE: Does it look better than the black? PAUL: Let's go show Dave your new shirt. [laughs] ♪ ♪ HOLLYWOOD: You out here, boss? MARK: Yeah, I got you. Where's Blue Pill? HOLLYWOOD: Naw, I don't see Blue Pill. We're behind right now with the Kristiana, but it's not like I'm really worried about those guys. I am the greatest, I am the best. I'm calling Greg Captain Blue Pill because I hear he can't function without his blue pill. [laughs] MARK: I got two bunches inside here now. HOLLYWOOD: Oh, yeah, I see you over there. Way inside me, right? MARK: Big bunch, your, uh, 12 o'clock. It's the last days of harpooning because the fish are getting harder and harder to spot. The water temperature's beginning to change and the fish are diving deeper. Pretty soon, even I won't be able to see 'em from the plane. 20 boat lengths or so. HOLLYWOOD: Here. JOEL: We need to find some fish. GREG: Keep your eyes on the water and take your eyeballs out of your pockets, maybe we would find some. GIBBS: Yup. It's a knockdown, drag-out fight for these last few fish that are running on the surface. Hopefully, they come up in a little while. GREG: No kidding. We're at the tail end of the harpooning season. Team Kristiana is as strong as it's ever been. Everybody gets along. Everybody has the same goal, and that is to beat Hollywood. Come on, we need to find one here. Everybody's tired of hearing Hollywood trash talk and brag about himself. We beat him this year, he's going to lose his mind. He's not going to be able to take it, he's going to move out of town. Hope these aren't gonna be all plane fish today. JOEL: We don't need that plane. MARK: At 12 o'clock, six boat lengths, come left a touch. HOLLYWOOD: It's so important this year for me to beat the Kristiana. It's very simple--I have to win. There's no other way for me but to win. JIMMY: How does the speed feel? MARK: Feels great, but keep the speed up. HOLLYWOOD: Hey! JIMMY: Who's this coming? MARK: This boat's going to blow our chances by spooking the fish. This guy's freaking right out. He's out of his mind. HOLLYWOOD: There he comes, he's gonna act up. MARK: Guy's nuts. HOLLYWOOD: [bleep] you! I'm gonna get you next time! This boat's harassing me for the same reason everyone else does. They can't handle Captain Hollywood hammering fish. MARK: Guy's flipping out. HOLLYWOOD: I guess I get under people's skin sometimes. It's just part of being Captain Hollywood, you love to hate me. What a bunch of [bleep]. What's wrong with these people? MARK: There should be a bunch right here somewhere. I got 'em over here, they're coming back up, four or five boats, they're all jumping over there. JIMMY: See 'em there in front of us? Down this straight, right in front of us. HOLLYWOOD: Right in front of us. MARK: Three boat lengths. HOLLYWOOD: Plow right in there, Jimmy. MARK: Come left. Swimming from your right to your left. Left. Hard left. Fish are off to your left. Coming. Two boat lengths. Boat length and a half. Ah, hold that steady for a second more. ♪ ♪ HOLLYWOOD: Damn, I missed him! MARK: Nuts! Thought he was almost going to have a real try there. HOLLYWOOD: I had to try that one deep, there's nothing I could do. JIMMY: Yeah. HOLLYWOOD: If I miss, it's on me. And that's what I like about my operation. It's all up to me in the end. I'm here to win, I'm here to go home with the biggest paycheck. I'm not out here trying to make friends. We're getting madness today, we got fighting, we got yelling. [laughs] TYLER: I have to keep fishing. This year's been really tough, we've been fishing around the clock. Drake got sick and he had to go home, and it stinks, it's terrible. Last week, I had to cut my trip short to bring my mate, Drake, into the hospital. TYLER: I guess Drake can't help being sick, but I can't afford to not be fishing. I had to call for some reinforcements, because I'm kind of in a jam and I need to go fishing, and there's only one person I know that can come fishing with me right now. The other boats are catching fish, the competition is fierce. I definitely need an ace in the hole. I need someone I can count on, someone that's fished with me in the past. Someone who knows how to get the job done and can catch fish. That's exactly who I called, I'm just waiting for him to get here. TRAVIS: I don't even know if Tyler's going to recognize me without all my hair. What's up, man? TYLER: Yo, how you doing, brother? Good to see you, man. Dude, what happened to all your hair, man? TRAVIS: I donated it. Someone else needed it more than I did, that's for sure. I'm pretty pumped up to be here, fishing on the Pinwheel again. Hopefully, we can just pick it up to where did last year and kick ass. We need to get this boat cleaned up. TYLER: Oh, please, come on, let's go catch fish, let's go catch fish. TRAVIS: Alright. MARK: You picking me up? HOLLYWOOD: What's going on? MARK: Nothing, they're gone now. I can look around in here if you want. I don't know, kind of see. It's mainly on me to find the majority of the fish and make any day profitable for the Lily. Let alone the last day. They got to be right up on top or you're freakin' done. The fish are getting deeper, so it's do or die time now. Go see if we can find 'em. HOLLYWOOD: One anyways. I missed a fish today, but I'm still not worried about those guys on the Kristiana. I can write the book now and tell you the end of the, the last chapter, how it's gonna go. Pain and suffering for the Greg Show. GREG: That's them there, I got 'em now, they're making water, I'm going to go on 'em. JOEL: Grab, yep, yep. GREG: They're from 10 o'clock to 1 o'clock! JOEL: Line it up. GREG: Lining it up. I'm gonna take you in on the left side. They seem back a little bit. Now that's what it's all about right there, Joel. MARK: Alright, they're coming back up, coming back up. Probably your 10 o'clock there. HOLLYWOOD: Right here, right here, right here. MARK: Six boat lengths. JOEL: There you go, right up the middle, Greg. GREG: Oh, right there, you're right on 'em, Joel. MARK: Uh, they've turned. Four boats or so now. HOLLYWOOD: Got it at kill speed? JIMMY: Yeah, we're close. MARK: Come right a touch. Right, right some, right. GREG: Point at one and lock on it! JOEL: There you go, straight ahead, 12 o'clock. MARK: 12 o'clock. GREG: Right there, yup, yup, yup, yup. MARK: One boat length. And... GREG: Come on, Gibbs, hit him. ♪ ♪ GREG: Right there! MARK: One boat length. And... GREG: Come on, Gibbs, hit him. HOLLYWOOD: Hit him! MARK: Got him. GREG: He's dead! JOEL: Yeah, Gibbs! HOLLYWOOD: Ha! Whacked another one! MARK: Number one, number one. [laughs] GIBBS: One, two, three. GREG: Yeah! Nice, Gibbs! [laughs] Hey! What do you got? GIBBS: 79! GREG: That's it! 79 inches. I want to go out on a high note and kick Hollywood right in the ass. Look for a big one! GIBBS: I'm gonna! HOLLYWOOD: Nice one. Look at that. Bingo. Pull him right up, Jimbo. Nice one. Nice! Here, Jimbo. Let's see what we got. 73, we'll take him. I'm relieved. We finally got our first fish of the day. Who's better than me? MARK: I'm not sure how the Kristiana got in the lead. But we're going to fix that today. HOLLYWOOD: I asked for one more. God give it to me. JAY: Today's a brand new day. Bright, sunny day, and we're in a good area, and... You feel good? MARCIANO: I feel good. JAY: Alright. We feel good. 'Cause I feel whatever he feels. MARCIANO: Last week, when Jay was off the boat, my son Joe and I caught four fish. JOE: Hey, good job! MARCIANO: Well done. MARCIANO: Number four. Bringing us to the top of the leaderboard. Joe earned himself some time off. So this week, it's old school, just Jay and I. This is one of our secret spots, Jay. This place has been good to us in the past. Let's hope it's good to us today. JAY: Yeah. Hopefully, it's not too secret. MARCIANO: We can't come back empty. We need at least one. JAY: Check it out, this is my workout. [laughing] Fishing with Dave is a lot more fun when you're on top of the fleet. [laughing] MARCIANO: Jay's losing it. He's getting punchy. What are you doing? JAY: Help me out. MARCIANO: Oh, wait. [laughing] You need to work out more. JAY: Alright. Time to go fishing. [laughing] This is Tyler! 'Ah! We're on!' MARCIANO: Stick figure boy. That's Jay's Tyler impression. JAY: We're on! Ahh! MARCIANO: After being out here for days on end working around the clock... JAY: Ahh! MARCIANO: ...it's crucial to have a little fun. If you can't laugh, life's not worth living. JAY: Pin squeak. Mehh! [laughs] TYLER: Ahh! [laughs] Woo! Well done, Travis! Travis! This is the real deal, we've been waiting all day for this. It feels great. First just with Travis on board, getting us back in the race. Everything's gravy on the Pinwheel. Woo-hoo-hoo! [laughs] TRAVIS: We've caught plenty of fish before, and I intend on doing it again. Woo-hoo-hoo! Definitely a tuna fish. He's under it all day. TYLER: Let it go, let it go. Back the drag off. I see color! Color, color, color! Little baby tuna. Little guy. We're gonna have to let him live to grow another day, huh? You have to catch a fish at 73 inches or greater in order to harvest it. Anything less gets released. It ensures that the fish has the opportunity to reproduce. Swim away, little buddy. Look, there he goes. See ya later. Hey, we'll catch him when he's older. ♪ ♪ GREG: Right in the front! Right down! Look, keep your head down. JOEL: Take it to the right side of the pile. I'm going to come left a little. Still up, it's up to the right. One o'clock! GREG: We've got four fish and Hollywood has four fish. We're neck and neck. We're hoping from a money point of view we're actually ahead of him. Point to the one you want! JOEL: Right at 12! I got color on the right! Color on the right! GIBBS: They're gone. You can tell it's the last days for harpooning 'cause the fish are getting harder and harder to spot. This could be our last shot at a paycheck this year, because tomorrow, they might just stay down. Let's not race around, whatever we do. GREG: Yeah. JIMMY: Oh, I don't know. I think, I don't think they're doing anything. JIMMY: Yeah. But who's counting? [laughs] HOLLYWOOD: We're tied with Greg today with one fish. He's got one and we got one. We need a top quality fish to catch the Kristiana. I can't let those bums beat me. I love when they bring the pressure on. It makes me just focus on killing 'em. Coming in now. MARK: I see activity. A dozen fish or so, uh, your, uh, 12:30, about eight boat lengths. MARK: It's them jumping right there. Pick up the power a little bit. HOLLYWOOD: Pick your speed right up and come around. Got 'em? Got 'em, Jimmy? JIMMY: There's only a couple there, I think. HOLLYWOOD: One more, I'd be real happy. GREG: We got 'em right here! There's still fins and tails right beside us. Right beside us. Right in front of you. GIBBS: Oh, yeah, baby. Get me on that big boy. GREG: We're in attack speed. It'd be nice to get another fish here. MARK: Three boats or so. Kind of spread out in front of you there a little bit. JIMMY: Oh, there you are. Right here. HOLLYWOOD: Oh, yeah, yeah. Go ahead, take him, take him, Jimmy. JOEL: Cut it behind him and come up. 12 o'clock, right in front of you, color. GREG: Yeah, that's a big bastard right there. GIBBS: Oh, get me on that. JOEL: A couple boats away. MARK: Two boat lengths. That's going dead away from you. HOLLYWOOD: They're right there. GREG: Oh, yeah, they're right there, right there, right there, right there, right there. HOLLYWOOD: Right here, right here, right here, right here, right here. GREG: Get him, Greg. HOLLYWOOD: Right here. GIBBS: Hit him! GIBBS: Yeah! HOLLYWOOD: Yeah! Woo! HOLLYWOOD: Come up on him, Jimmy! Oh, my God. I asked for one more. JOEL: This trip, the Kristiana started out ahead of the Lily. I think this fish will keep it that way. Feels like a big one. GREG: 74 inches. Hollywood feels he has to be the number one boat or he's going to lose face, so he's definitely nervous that we're gonna beat him. Captain's happy! JOEL: Put some blood on the deck just like I wanted. And it's game time. MARK: Bam! HOLLYWOOD: Rip him right in. Good shot. JIMMY: Nice one, too, Billy. HOLLYWOOD: Is it? Let's measure him. I want to re-rig. 82. Nice. Right here, buddy. Huh? That was teamwork. Nice. MARK: Oh, yeah. Coming again at your 11 o'clock there. HOLLYWOOD: I want another one. I mean, I was just happy with that. I need another one right now. MARK: Probably, uh, oh, God, 10 boat lengths, something like that. HOLLYWOOD: It ain't over yet. Get right over there, Jimmy. MARK: Six boats or so. Come right a touch. That's good, steady. Come left now, Jimmy, come left. Three boat lengths. Steady like that for a second, steady. Steady like that. 12 o'clock. Boat length and a half. HOLLYWOOD: It's all on me to hit this slob to cap off our season. MARK: Come on, baby. JIMMY: Hit him! MARK: Three boat lengths. Steady like that for a second, steady. Steady like that. 12 o'clock. Boat length and a half. Come on, baby. JIMMY: Hit him! HOLLYWOOD: Got him! [laughs] Ha ha! Ha! Nice shot! Oh, God! [laughs] MARK: Bingo! Got him. I was getting a little nervous. Just a little. HOLLYWOOD: Hurry up. Right up there, right up there. Friggin' monster! Nice fish. 89. That's all he is, 89. JIMMY: Look how big he is. HOLLYWOOD: Oh, what a slob. I can't think of a better way to cap off this season than catching three fish. Look at that thing, a butterball! Absolutely gorgeous. JIMMY: That's probably the nicest one we've gotten. ♪ ♪ GREG: What's up, PJ? PJ: What do you got today, Greg? GREG: I got a pair for you today. PJ: Let's haul 'em up, see what they look like. GREG: Alright. With the season for harpooning coming to an end, this could be our last chance to kick Hollywood's ass once and for all. PJ: 185. GREG: Nice! PJ: 209 pounds. GREG: Awesome! PJ: Yeah. GREG: Awesome. Nice, fat, little fish. GIBBS: These fish aren't huge, but we're all hoping for good quality to keep us in the lead. GREG: Alright, PJ, what do you think? PJ: It's not a bad fish. Could use a little more fat, but it does have some fat. The inside color's good. This is gonna bring you $12 a pound. GREG: Wow. PJ: Alright? GIBBS: 12 bucks a pound, not that great. I'm crossing my fingers the second fish is worth more. PJ: Moment of truth. GIBBS: Yup. GREG: How does it look? PJ: It looks pretty decent. A nice, little shape to it. GREG: Yeah, it's got some nice fat. PJ: The color's really nice, nice texture to it. Feels oily. $15 a pound, Greg. GREG: Alright! PJ: Yeah! GREG: Nice! Three grand! PJ: Nice! GREG: Nice. PJ: Nice fish. GIBBS: Beautiful. Thanks, PJ. JOEL: Appreciate it, appreciate that. GREG: That puts a smile on our face. PJ: Nice! GREG: If we end up beating Hollywood, he's gonna lose his mind. He'll never be able to handle it. He's just not gonna handle it. NARRATOR: Kristiana's two-fish haul extends their lead over rival Lily. HOLLYWOOD: I come in with three fish. Who's better than me? [laughs] PJ: Nice! HOLLYWOOD: We have three fish, but the Kristiana has two. And they could still beat us in the money. What do we got, PJ? PJ: A little peanut. 148 pounds. 233 pounds. 368 pounds. HOLLYWOOD: Nice! JIMMY: Nice! HOLLYWOOD: Let's see what we got for quality on 'em. JIMMY: Check it out. HOLLYWOOD: Earlier in the season we got low prices on our first fish. So it's really important that we get a good price per pound on these fish. PJ: Wow! Where'd the beef go, Jimmy? JIMMY: I don't know. PJ: No beef on this one. JIMMY: Nope. PJ: Pretty lean. $6 a pound. HOLLYWOOD: Alright. PJ: That's what red meat's paying. HOLLYWOOD: Alright, alright. JIMMY: Okay. HOLLYWOOD: That's only $888, and that's not gonna cut it. Number two here, PJ, what do we got? PJ: Wow! Looks nice. Way better than the first one. Some real nice fat to it. Beautiful shape for a small fish. HOLLYWOOD: Yeah. PJ: $14 a pound. JIMMY: Nice! HOLLYWOOD: Nice! HOLLYWOOD: Alright. About time. We got a nice, little butterball coming next. PJ: Ooh! HOLLYWOOD: Our third fish is bigger, but to beat the Kristiana, we still need a great price per a pound. [whistles] PJ: Very pretty! Wow. That's beautiful. That's a real nice fish. HOLLYWOOD: Does Greg got one of these fatties? PJ: Not today. [laughs] I think I got a guy in Tokyo that's gonna like this fish. HOLLYWOOD: Really? PJ: Oh, yeah. HOLLYWOOD: You got a separate guy just for this one? PJ: Yup. This is going right to the top shelf. HOLLYWOOD: Oh! PJ: We're gonna go $22 a pound on this. HOLLYWOOD: Oh, my God, jeez! What the hell? PJ: Nice fish, boys. JIMMY: Oh! HOLLYWOOD: The harpoon season is ending. But as always, it's a great season for the Lily. Jimmy, not a bad day, huh? PJ: Perfect. JIMMY: A couple fat ones. Beautiful. HOLLYWOOD: We're rolling in dough tonight! PJ: Rolling in it. Hit the jackpot. NARRATOR: Lily's impressive haul pushes them ahead of rival Kristiana. PAUL: We're gonna have some potato patties with some eggs, and some bagels. Maybe we'll have sandwiches, bagel sandwiches. Geordie and I have been out here for a couple of days now. It's been really slow. I'm not worried one bit. GEORDIE: I will supervise this ordeal. We haven't had any luck yet. Paul's really not too worried about it. But the bottom line is, I need to catch a fish with Paul so that I can have a paycheck. I want to buy a house in the next year and a half, next 18 months, and hopefully I can pull that off. I know he's getting pretty frustrated. I understand why he's having such a hard time keeping a crew. He could be a little difficult to deal with and aggravates a lot of people. PAUL: All is quiet, marking eggshells. GEORDIE: I wish we were marking tunas. [beeping] SANDRO: Oh, God! There he is. Look at that machine! [beeping] DAVE: So, it's got to go off, it's got to go. So far we've had a hook pulled, and lots of marks, but no bites. SANDRO: Oh! All over, man. Unbelievable. DAVE: Well, we've got to get a bite here. SANDRO: All over. [whistles] [beeping] Wow, I can't believe we're not tight right now. Oh, my goodness. DAVE: We've got to get a bite. We've got to get a bite. Well, we can't do anything else. There he is, there he is, there he is! That's it. You got him! [snap] You've got to [bleep] be kidding me! No [bleep] way! Another hook pulled. You've got to be kidding me. This is not gonna get us into the lead, and that's for sure. SANDRO: We are literally cursed, literally cursed. DAVE: I'm totally beside myself. SANDRO: This is too much, dude, this is too much. [reel unspooling] We're on! We're on! [beeping] DAVE: We're on! We're on! We're on! We're on! SANDRO: He's acting weird. DAVE: Come on, Sandro. SANDRO: Come on, Dave. Grab the wheel! DAVE: I'm running around a little more than usual. And I'm definitely missing having Geordie here. No, leave it, leave it for now. Wait, let me get the bow rod. SANDRO: I'm moving this rod to the middle, so I could drive the boat, too. SANDRO: Just acting really strange. He goes, he stops, he goes, he stops. DAVE: Alright, I'm back with you. Everything's clear. Anchor's right there. I'm getting the harpoon out, right? Take your time, we're gonna get this one. Say a prayer to God. SANDRO: I don't even want to talk I'm so nervous. Here we go. Now it's business. DAVE: Down to business! Do we actually have a hook in a fish that's staying in for the moment? SANDRO: No. For the moment, yeah, for the moment. DAVE: I'm so freaking nervous right now. If that hook came out, I don't know whether I'd cry... SANDRO: I'd quit. DAVE: Throw a tantrum. SANDRO: Right here, dude. Hold on. Hold on. DAVE: Whoa, oh! SANDRO: That's badass. Whoa! DAVE: Lift, if you can. Lift, lift, lift, lift, watch your face. SANDRO: Oh, yeah! DAVE: Got one! Yeah. SANDRO: Yeah! Praise the lord! DAVE: Hey, hey, come here. Let me see. Pinch. SANDRO: Ow! It's real life. 1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3. Look at that. We finally did it, we got a fish. 84. DAVE: Wow! You know what? Now I'm happy. I can't believe we got one. SANDRO: Do you believe in miracles? PJ: Way to go, Dave! DAVE: 84 inches. PJ: Nice, good size. DAVE: Let's get him up. PJ: 241 pounds dressed. SANDRO: Nice. Take it, yeah. PJ: Nice, little fish. SANDRO: Go check it out. PJ: Check her out. He's loaded. SANDRO: Did you say loaded? PJ: This is very pretty, Dave. Inside color's beautiful. DAVE: What are you thinking? Come on. PJ: $20 a pound on this one, Dave. SANDRO: Oh, wow, nice. Yes, sir. I'll take it. DAVE: That's our best price per pound yet, and that's just what we needed. Now we're gonna head right back out there and do it again. PJ: Get you some ice. DAVE: We'll be back tomorrow. PJ: Thank you, guys. SANDRO: Thanks, bud. NARRATOR: Dot Com's highest quality fish so far this season edges them closer to the fleet's leaders. TYLER: Pretty fishy morning we got here this morning. A lot of bait around, baits are starting to dispersed. Any point in time the big predators could come through. Just want to make sure we got all our bait set, just went through everything. Got three rods out. Need a bite. The Pinwheel only has three fish so far this season. That's terrible. We gonna get bit or what? TRAVIS: It's all mackerel. TYLER: No, I know. But the bait is here, so we just got to wait it out. What are you doing to me, dude? [beeping] TRAVIS: We're marking! We're marking! [beeping] [reel ticking] [reel unspooling] We're on! We're on! TRAVIS: Got him on. There it is! TYLER: Nice, nice. TRAVIS: Got him on! TRAVIS: We're good to go. Big fish, taking a lot of line. Running him down. TYLER: We got a really big fish on here. It just took about five football fields of line. He's way out, we're trying to catch up to him. Get some line back on the reel. TYLER: When he ate the bait, he came up, and he got the line wrapped around his tail, and that's why we're pulling backwards now, we're not pulling from his mouth. So he's got a big advantage. Not only is it the first thing in the morning and only about five brain cells work, we got about a 600-pound bluefin on the other end that's firing on all cylinders. TRAVIS: You know what I'd like right now? TYLER: What? TRAVIS: Just like a cold glass of milk... TYLER: I got you, brother, I got you. TRAVIS: Maybe some cookies. TYLER: I got you, dude. I got you. TRAVIS: Should we start cooking breakfast? TYLER: Alright, listen, that's a little too complicated, we only got seven brain cells between the two of us. TRAVIS: Tyler and I, we're just gonna play this fish out. I mean, if it takes five hours, it takes five hours. TYLER: Here, sweetie. TRAVIS: That's not very good. Thanks, man, appreciate it. TYLER: You're welcome. TRAVIS: And, uh, you know, woke up to a bite. TYLER: He's like five or six football fields behind the boat right now. And he's mean! Ah-ooh, keep winding, baby! Thank God, dude. We needed this bite to start the day. TRAVIS: Ah, beautiful sunrise, beautiful bent rod, what more could you ask for? TYLER: This is a bigger fish than what we thought, bro. This thing's 90 inches all day. 500-pounder. You're doing a phenomenal job on the rod right now. Whoa, swivel, swivel, swivel, swivel. Where'd you go, where's he go, where's he going? TRAVIS: Good, good, good, good, good, good. Take it out of gear. TYLER: Neutch. TRAVIS: There he is, there he is, there he is. Right on top, right on top. TYLER: I see him, I see him. You gonna harpoon him? TRAVIS: Yeah. TYLER: There he is! Look at the sickles on that mother! Woo! Easy, he's coming at us now, he just changed directions. You gonna harpoon him? TRAVIS: Yeah. TYLER: Come here, then. Come dart, he's right here, dart his ass! Oh, you missed the barn door. Nice, Travis! Yeah, buddy! Oh, I broke him off! It's getting away! We're losing him! TYLER: Right here. Dart his ass! Nice, Travis! Yeah, buddy! Ah, I broke him off! Now he's on the dart line. Oh! Oh! Oh! TRAVIS: We're losing him! TYLER: Oh, great. Oh, great. We broke him off on the line, now we got him on the harpoon. Pull him right up to you. Get a gaff. Come on, Travis, here's the tuna. Nice! Woo! Hell yeah! Break him off. Man, let's get the job done, baby! Woo! Pinwheel, baby! TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy. TYLER: Woo! First one, brother. First one! This just goes to show you how well Travis and I work together on the boat. We know how to get it done. Wow, look at this one! Nice! TRAVIS: Ah, man! Look how round this thing is, dude! TYLER: Look, dude, he's as big as the boat. We need a bigger boat. Let's go, what do we got, what do we got, what'd we got? Come on, come on, come on. TRAVIS: 99. TYLER: Ah! I got 99 problems and catching a bluefin ain't one. Boom! Pinwheel, baby! PAUL: I just left, and we're going four miles from here. GEORDIE: Yep. PAUL: I think this is where you guys were. Right? We're almost at the end of the week and had no luck. So we're heading to my favorite spot. You only have so much money to keep the boat going without having money coming in. GEORDIE: Is that Dave to the east there? It might be. Paul and I haven't really seen anything in a couple days. It can get old quick, especially if fishing's slow. I need to catch one with Paul, otherwise I'm down a paycheck. Yeah, it's Dave right in front of us there, bud. PAUL: When you're fishing, and Dot Com's there, you know you're in a good spot, 'cause he is a good fisherman. They're definitely around, you know? [laughs] [beeping] [reel ticking] [beeping] [reel ticking] [beeping] [reel unspooling] DAVE: Sandro, we're on! We're on! Wake up, wake up! Come on, Sandro! SANDRO: We're on? DAVE: Yes. Turn, start it up. This week may have started out slow, but things have definitely turned around for us. SANDRO: Am I dreaming right now? Am I dreaming? DAVE: I heard that reel screaming, I thought I was dreaming. He's up high. That's a big boy right there. SANDRO: Oh, yeah. DAVE: Paul's right there. They're looking at us right now. They know we're on. SANDRO: Woo, baby! DAVE: I bet Geordie wished he was over here right now, huh, Sanchie? SANDRO: Yeah. GEORDIE: Yeah, Dave's working on one over there. I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish I was over there with Dave and Sandro right now, but I'm not. And that sucks. That's frustrating, this is a [bleep] joke! An absolute joke. SANDRO: Woo, baby. Here we go! DAVE: Get him, Sanchie! Get him, get him! Come on, boy. Big boy! SANDRO: He's coming back. DAVE: Got the angle, we got the angle. You got this, Sandro. Come on! SANDRO: Ahh! Stay neutral, stay neutral, stay neutral. He's coming way up, now. Swivel. DAVE: Right there, he's right there. I got it. He's got great color, great color. Big-ass fish! Good color, good color, baby! I'll take a shot. Got him. SANDRO: Ah, yeah, Davey! There we go! DAVE: We don't have him yet. Right on over here. Yeah, got one. Woo-hoo-hoo! SANDRO: Woo! Yes! I'm stoked to catch this fish. I'm just excited that we got our second fish of the week. We are lucky! DAVE: 104 and a half. I'll take it! SANDRO: That's nice. DAVE: Big, yeah, he is. Paul, Geordie, you there? Come in. GEORDIE: Go ahead. DAVE: Jumbo. Wrapped up. PAUL: Good job. GEORDIE: Nice work, bud. DAVE: It was on the Dot Com special. GEORDIE: Good job. DAVE: Maybe Geordie should stay over on the Wicked Pissah with Paul, 'cause the Dot Com's having a good week. GEORDIE: Alright, nice work, boys. DAVE: We'll get on the ball and go fish. I want to get this fish in now, so I can get the best price possible. GEORDIE: Rather be lucky than good, right? PAUL: Any day. ♪ ♪ MARCIANO: Well, that's it, we're fishing. We shifted up way inside here. We're hoping to find some answers close to home. This is real close to home. It's crucial we put a fish on this deck, to keep our place on top. [beeping] JAY: We're marking! We're marking! [beeping] [reel ticking] [reel unspooling] Oh, we're on! MARCIANO: I'll get your gloves, Jay. Reel, reel, reel! JAY: I don't think we got a monster, but we got something here. MARCIANO: It's sure acting like a fish. JAY: Yeah, he's acting like fish, you know. Making big circles out there. This is gonna be a nice, this is a nice fish. Coming under the boat a little. Got it for a sec? MARCIANO: Yep. We're on something here. I'm hoping it's a fish. If it's a keeper, it's just what we need. I'm not sure, though. It doesn't feel awful, awful monstrous, but... JAY: Color, color! MARCIANO: A shark. JAY: Shark, [bleep] monster. MARCIANO: [bleep] things. You can't get clear of 'em. JAY: That's what it is, what it is. ♪ ♪ PAUL: They're rubbing the bottom. They're nudging. They should eat that haddock! Eat that haddock. Eat that haddock. I'm spending a few hundred bucks every single day. That's a couple thousand dollars a week just to run the boat. Put it this way-- I am not going in until I catch one. GEORDIE: Dot Com caught two fish this week. Would've been nice to be a part of that. Over here on the Wicked Pissah, we don't have anything yet. Maybe this is why Paul's got a bad rep around Gloucester. PAUL: Eat that haddock! Eat that haddock! [beeping] Hey, we're marking. [beeping] We're marking right now. [beeping] Here we go. Get ready. [reel unspooling] We're on, baby! Come on! PAUL: Come on, baby, come on! [laughs] This could be the one right here, Geordie. GEORDIE: This could be it. PAUL: You never know, baby. ♪ ♪ GEORDIE: Feels like he's doing circles, Paul, big ones. Counterclockwise. PAUL: I'm coming back a little bit. Sock him down, Geordie, kick his ass! GEORDIE: Come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back, come back! [Paul laughs] PAUL: That a boy, Geordie. GEORDIE: Tug-of-war, give and take. PAUL: Tug-of-war, Geordie! GEORDIE: Give and take. Come back, shot of reverse, shot of reverse. Good, neutral. PAUL: We're almost there, little Geordie. GEORDIE: Right there, yep, leave it right there. He's already coming around again. PAUL: Yep. GEORDIE: I got color, deep, deep color, Paul. He's coming up a little bit here, Paul. PAUL: I see him, I see him. Close enough where I can smell him. Stay on him tight, Geordie, so I can try to get a shot, alright? GEORDIE: Yeah, he's coming up. PAUL: I see. GEORDIE: You got a great dart shot right here. You got him. PAUL: Nailed him! GEORDIE: Nailed it. Look at that. PAUL: Let's tail rope behind him. GEORDIE: I'll get the gaff. PAUL: You got him, buddy? GEORDIE: I got him in the tail. He's starting to freak out. PAUL: Hold on, lift that up! Oh, stop it! Lift up. You got him? GEORDIE: Yeah, I got him. PAUL: Yeah, we got him. GEORDIE: Woo! PAUL: We smoked him. GEORDIE: It's nice to go help out a friend. But it's even better when you don't lose out on any money. [laughs] PAUL: That's it, lift up. Nice fish. Alright, right over to me. Wow, 100-incher. GEORDIE: All day long. PAUL: Yes, take a guess. GEORDIE: 100. PAUL: 100 inches. He's a beautiful tuna. [laughs] TYLER: What up, Gut? GUT: Hey what's going on? TYLER: You remember this guy from last year? GUT: Yeah, he got a haircut, huh? TYLER: Yeah, it's pretty awesome. He's back, he's on it, he didn't miss a beat on the rod. GUT: Well, let's get him out and see what it looks like. TYLER: In the truck you go, dude, have a nice flight. GUT: 438 dressed. TYLER: Nice. TRAVIS: Wow, that's a good fish. TYLER: Look at that, dude. Wow! GUT: Good core, decent fat. Uh...give you $14 a pound for this. TYLER: I'll take it, brother. TRAVIS: 14, only 14? GUT: That's all you're getting. TYLER: Come on, knucklehead. Just do as you're told. NARRATOR: Pinwheel's fourth fish of the season is good enough to get them into fourth place. PAUL: Oh, it's so good to have you, Geordie. GEORDIE: It was fun, we got 'em. PJ: What's up, Geordie? GEORDIE: Got 'em. PJ: Way to go, man. PAUL: You're a thick little fella. What do we got? PJ: 413 pounds dressed. PAUL: Alright, that's good. GEORDIE: Not bad. PAUL: Hell yeah. PJ: Oh, good inside color, guys. PAUL: Good. PJ: Good band of skin fat here along the skin edge. Could use a little bit more in the major lobes, but... PAUL: Yeah, what do you think? PJ: 14 bucks. PAUL: Yes, yeah! I'll take it! PJ: Good job, guys. PAUL: Thanks, PJ! Geordie was key to this trip. I wouldn't have this fish if it wasn't for Dave giving me Geordie. Thanks, Geordie. GEORDIE: It was a joy. PJ: Take care. See you, man. NARRATOR: Wicked Pissah's first catch in almost four weeks gives Paul a much needed boost in the earnings. PJ: What's up, Dave? DAVE: What's up, PJ? PJ: Got one, huh? DAVE: Yeah, we got a good one. DAVE: First fish we brought in got us almost five grand. It'll be great if this jumbo can get a price just as good. Bloody decks on the Dot Com. SANDRO: That's how we like 'em. PJ: 495. DAVE: We earned this fish. SANDRO: Let's check it out. Beautiful color. PJ: Beautiful meat quality, guys, you took great care of this fish, very beautiful inside color. $18 a pound. SANDRO: Take that all day long. PJ: Nice fish, guys. SANDRO: Nice. DAVE: We made almost nine grand. Can't ask for a better trip than that. We helped Paul out, we gave him Geordie, so maybe on this trip there was such a thing as good karma. NARRATOR: At the end of week six, Dot Com's biggest payday yet sees them ending the week of fishing in the top spot for the first time this season. ♪ ♪ PAUL: This week I got a good one with Geordie. Dot Com needs him back. I can't do this by myself, that's for sure. Friggin' nobody can. I know what I got to do. ♪ ♪ Hey, man. You want to go tuna fishing?
