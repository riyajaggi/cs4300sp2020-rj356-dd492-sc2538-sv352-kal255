 IN THE WORLD... PAUL HEBERT: HUGE. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WHOO! PETE SPEECHES: TRYING TO GET FISH IN HERE. NARRATOR: THESE FISHERMAN FIGHT TO EARN A LIVING. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: THIS ONE'S GONNA BURY US. WHOA! TJ OTT: THAT'S WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, BABY, RIGHT THERE! BLUEFIN, WHOA! NARRATOR: CATCHING... LANCE SISTARE: YEAH, BABY! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: EVERYONE, GAME FACES. TJ OTT: PAPOW! NARRATOR: WICKED TUNA. AT THE START OF WEEK 8, LAST YEAR'S CHAMP, HARD MERCHANDISE, COMMANDS THE LEAD, WHILE WICKED PISSAH AIMS TO BEAT OLD BUDDY DOT COM. AND PINWHEEL FLOUNDERS AT THE BOTTOM. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: LET'S GO TO ANOTHER 14-OUNCE WEIGHT. LAST WEEK SUCKED. WE HAD SOME DRAMA WITH DOT COM. I'M CUTTING YOUR LINES, MAN. AND I GOT THE COASTGUARD CALLED ON ME. COAST GUARD: JUST STAY AWAY FROM HIM ALRIGHT? TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: YES SIR, OH ABSOLUTELY. I'M DONE DEALING WITH ALL THIS DRAMA. BUT WHAT REALLY SUCKED WAS DROPPING IN THE LAST PLACE. THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. I GOT A FULL CREW NOW AND TOGETHER WE'RE GONNA FOCUS ON NOTHING ELSE BUT CATCHING BLUEFIN AND GETTING OUT OF LAST PLACE. DRAKE ROY: ALL RIGHT, THIS IS WEIRD, BUT LIKE MY NEIGHBOR IS WHOOPI GOLDBERG. TRAVIS BROWN: UH-HUH. DRAKE ROY: SO, I HAVE HER GLASSES ON. BUT THAT'S ME AND MY GIRL. AND THERE'S WHOOPI LIKE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S WHOOPI GOLDBERG'S FOREHEAD. TRAVIS BROWN: WHOOPI'S FOREHEAD? DRAKE ROY: OH, MAN. TRAVIS BROWN: AM I SUPPOSED TO BE IMPRESSED? IT'S OBVIOUS THAT DRAKE AND I DIDN'T GROW UP IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. I'VE BEEN FISHING SINCE I WAS 13 YEARS OLD. I HAD AWESOME PARENTS, BUT I HAD TO WORK FOR EVERYTHING THAT I'VE EVER HAD. AND THAT MAKES ME APPRECIATE THINGS A LOT MORE KNOWING THAT I WORKED FOR THEM. I HAD TO START SUPPORTING MYSELF, AND OBVIOUSLY DRAKE REALLY DOESN'T HAVE TO. THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HE DOES ON THE BOAT IS REFLECTING THAT NOW. [BEEPING]. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: OH, MARKED ONE, YEAH. DRAKE ROY: I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED MY ENTIRE LIFE. I WAS HOMESCHOOLED ON MY FRIEND'S 130 FOOT BOAT. IT'S AN INTERESTING TRANSITION, GOING FROM SOMETHING, LIKE LIVING ON A YACHT LIKE THAT TO YOU KNOW WORKING ON THE PINWHEEL. BUT THAT DOESN'T AFFECT MY WORK ETHIC. I'M JUST HERE TO GRIND AND CATCH FISH. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: AW, DUDE, JUST MARKED ONE ALL OVER THE DOWN ROD, MAN. THE VIBE ON THE BOAT'S REALLY WEIRD. DRAKE AND TRAVIS DEFINITELY COME FROM TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS. I DON'T CARE IF MY MATES DON'T GET ALONG, JUST AS LONG AS THEY CAN PUT THEIR DIFFERENCES ASIDE TO PUT THE FISH ON THE DECK. WE MARKED ONE HERE. COME ON, MAN, WE GOT FISHING TO DO! LANCE SISTARE: THERE'S YOUR BALLOON. PAUL, GET THAT! PAUL HEBERT: THE WICKED PISSAH TEAM FELL APART FOR A LITTLE BIT, BUT NOW WE'RE RUNNING ON ALL CYLINDERS. WE HAD A GREAT WEEK LAST WEEK! WE HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME, WE CAUGHT TWO FISH. LANCE SISTARE: TWO AT A TIME ON THE PISSAH! PAUL HEBERT: WE MADE 16 GRAND. A FEW GOOD CATCHES COULD PUT US RIGHT IN THE LEAD. [HIGH PITCHED HELIUM VOICE] COME ON, LET'S GET HIM! COME ON, YOU CAN GET HIM! COME ON, COME ON, LET'S GET THIS THING! COME ON, REEL, REEL, REEL, REEL! GET THE HARPOON, COME ON! LANCE SISTARE: A LITTLE FUN OUT HERE. YOU KNOW, GOES A LONG WAY. [BEEPING] PAUL HEBERT: HERE HE COMES! OH, IT'S A STREAKER. MY GOAL THIS WEEK IS TO GET AHEAD OF DOT COM. IT WOULD SHOW US AS A TEAM HOW GOOD WE ARE TOGETHER. LOOK AT HIM! COMING UP, RIGHT FOR IT. COMING ON IT! I LOVE YOU, DAVE, BUT I'M GONNA COME FOR YOU, MAN! BRAD KRASOWSKI: HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO, TUNA RIGHT THERE. [REEL UNSPOOLS RAPIDLY]. THAT'S A TUNA! LANCE SISTARE: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! PAUL HEBERT: HERE WE GO, MIGHT BE A GOOD ONE. LANCE SISTARE: GOT A GOOD BEND ON THE ROD. PAUL HEBERT: VERY UPSET FISH IS WHAT IT IS. LANCE SISTARE: THIS WILL BE HUGE IF THIS IS A TUNA. PAUL HEBERT: BRAD, TAKE IT. LANCE SISTARE: READY, BRAD? PAUL HEBERT: GO GET HIM, DUDE! BRAD KRASOWSKI: THANK YOU. THIS MIGHT BE A TUNA. PAUL HEBERT: YOU'RE ONLY LIKE 30 FEET AWAY, DUDE. LANCE SISTARE: GET HIM BRAD, GET HIM! PAUL HEBERT: THIS IS A GOOD BEND AND IT'S A BIG BASTARD! LANCE SISTARE: COULD BE A 500 POUNDER RIGHT HERE. PAUL HEBERT: AND A NICE ONE. LANCE SISTARE: ALL RIGHT, GAFF IS READY. BRAD KRASOWSKI: LOOK AT THAT ROD. PAUL HEBERT: LOOK AT THE ROD, DUDE! THAT'S INSANE! BRAD KRASOWSKI: I THINK HE'S RAN BACK DOWN, NOW HE, HE'S CIRCLING AROUND HERE. PAUL HEBERT: IT'S A BIG FISH, MAN. BRAD KRASOWSKI: BIG, BIG FISH. PAUL HEBERT: GRANDER. LANCE SISTARE: HERE IT COMES, HERE IT COMES. UH-OH, SHARK. BRAD KRASOWSKI: AW, COME ON! PAUL HEBERT: DAMMIT, DAMMIT! BRAD KRASOWSKI: SON OF A BITCH. COME ON, THAT IS BIG MAN. LANCE SISTARE: BIG. PAUL HEBERT: GONE. THAT SHARK ENDED UP TAKING ONE OF MY HOOKS WITH HIM. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT HOOK'S GONNA DISSOLVE AND FALL RIGHT OUT OF HIS MOUTH. LANCE SISTARE: LET'S GET RE-BAITED; LET'S GET BACK DOWN, I'LL START JIGGING. PAUL HEBERT: WELCOME TO TUNA FISHING. PETE SPEECHES: HOW'S MY BABY GIRL? SARAH SPEECHES: I'M DOING WELL. PETE SPEECHES: WE ONLY HAVE FOUR FISH, AND THAT IS DEFINITELY NOT WHERE THE ERIN & SARAH USUALLY IS IN A, IN A TYPICAL SEASON. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. I HAVE A COUPLE TRICKS UP MY SLEEVE THIS WEEK THAT HOPEFULLY TURN THINGS AROUND. MY DAUGHTER, SARAH, IS GONNA MAKE A TRIP WITH US. PETE SPEECHES: SHE DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF HANDS ON EXPERIENCE FISHING WITH ME ON THE BOAT, BUT JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME SARAH'S BEEN ON THE BOAT WITH ME, WE'VE CAUGHT AT LEAST ONE FISH. SHE'S BEEN VERY LUCKY FOR US. HEY, SARAH, YOU KNOW THAT SPOT WHERE WE CAUGHT A BUNCH OF FISH ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO? YOU HAD THAT GOOD WEEKEND? SARAH SPEECHES: YEAH. PETE SPEECHES: I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS A BITE THERE LAST NIGHT. ERIN SPEECHES: IT'LL BE NICE TO BE TUNA FISHING WITH MY SISTER, AND IT'S KIND A COOL, AND I'M REALLY EXCITED. PETE SPEECHES: THAT'S ALSO THE SAME SPOT THAT I TOOK YOU AND ERIN WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE TINY KID AND WE WENT OUT ON A CAMPING TRIP. SARAH SPEECHES: I PROJECTILE VOMITED ON YOU THAT NIGHT. ERIN SPEECHES: THAT WAS THE TIME THAT SARAH PROJECTILE VOMITED ON ME. PETE SPEECHES: YOU REMEMBER THAT? ERIN SPEECHES: EW, GOOD MEMORIES! PETE SPEECHES: IF YOU DO GOOD ON THIS TRIP, WE MIGHT POSTPONE YOUR COLLEGE START. WE MIGHT KEEP YOU A FEW EXTRA WEEKS. SARAH SPEECHES: ALL RIGHT, SEE HOW IT GOES. ERIN SPEECHES: OR IF WE DON'T CATCH FISH, YOU'LL HAVE TO POSTPONE YOUR START DATE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT. FISHING FOR TUITION WILL DRY UP. SARAH SPEECHES: CAN'T AFFORD ME. DAVE MARCIANO: THERE ARE FISH AROUND. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET A BITE. JOE MARCIANO: NO, WE'LL GET 'EM. DAVE MARCIANO: HEY, WHAT'S FOR LUNCH? JASON MUENZNER: CAUGHT YOU A HOOK BAIT. DAVE MARCIANO: WHAT IS IT? JASON MUENZNER: WHITING. DAVE MARCIANO: NICE, NICE, NICE. LAST WEEK, WE CAUGHT TWO HUGE FISH, AND PULLED AHEAD IN THE EARNINGS. AND WE GOT DOT COM AND WICKED PISSAH RIGHT BEHIND US. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING, TOO. JASON MUENZNER: YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE HAVING FOR LUNCH, RIGHT? JOE MARCIANO: BAIT? JASON MUENZNER: BAIT. SOME FRESH CLOVES OF GARLIC, JUST TO GET SOME FLAVOR UP IN THAT BIZ-NITCH. PUT THEM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE. WE GOTTA EAT WHAT THE TUNA ARE EATING TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOOD ENOUGH. YEAH... [REEL UNSPOOLS RAPIDLY]. BADA BOOM, BADA BING, WE'RE ON! DAVE MARCIANO: WHAT, WHAT? JASON AND JOE: WE'RE ON! DAVE MARCIANO: THE GUYS ARE COOKING LUNCH, AND WE HOOK UP. THE TUNA PROBABLY SMELLED IT AND WANTED TO JOIN US. JASON MUENZNER: SHARK. DAVE MARCIANO: SHARK. THAT DAMN SHARK BETTER NOT HAVE RUINED MY LUNCH. JASON MUENZNER: GONE. DAVE MARCIANO: CAN WE EAT NOW? JASON MUENZNER: THIS IS DONE. JOE MARCIANO: TA-DA! JASON MUENZNER: LOOKING GOOD. DAVE MARCIANO: NICE, WHITING ON THE GRILL. YOU CAN'T BEAT IT. IT'S GOOD STUFF. LIFE DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS. [BELCHES THEN SIGHS] TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: YOU'RE KILLING IT, DUDE. IT SMELLS DELICIOUS. WE'RE GHETTO BOATING OVER HERE ON THE PINWHEEL, AND DRAKE'S MAKING BOMB MEALS. WE'RE EATING BETTER THAN WE'VE EVER EATEN THIS SEASON. IF ONLY THE TUNAS WERE AS HUNGRY AS WE ARE. TRAVIS BROWN: DRAKE'S A PRETTY SMART KID. I MEAN, I'D LEARN HOW TO COOK IF I COULD DUMP MY REAL JOB ON SOMEONE ELSE. DRAKE ROY: GOT SOME GRILLED CARROTS OVER HERE. MY COOKING SKILLS DEFINITELY BRING SOMETHING TO THE TABLE. I MEAN, EVERY BOAT'S GOTTA HAVE A COOK. SO, I HAVE GONE TO SOME CULINARY SCHOOLS. TJ OTT: TYLER, YOU GOT THIS ONE ON? TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: COPY, WHAT'S UP? TJ OTT: THIS SUCKS. DUDE, WE HAVE A WHALE FEEDING AROUND US FOR THE LAST HOUR. AND WE MARKED NOTHING. THE HOT TUNA HASN'T CAUGHT FISH IN 2 WEEKS AND IT'S NOT A GREAT FEELING. YOU KNOW, WE'RE DEFINITELY IN A RUT RIGHT NOW, SO WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN THIS WEEK. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: DRAKE IS THE MASTER CHEF DUDE. TJ OTT: WHAT'D YOU COOK, DRAKE-WA? DRAKE ROY: SOME NICE STEAMING BROCCOLI WITH GARLIC. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: I'D LIKE TO HAVE DRAKE AND BUBBY GO AT IT. DRAKE ROY: I WOULD SMOKE BUBBY IN A COOK OFF. MIKE OTT: CHEF AZAH. THE BEST COOK IN THE FLEET IS DEFINITELY CHEF AZAH. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE AZAH CAME WITH, IT JUST STUCK. ABSOLUTELY MEANS PRETTY MUCH NOTHING, IT'S JUST A CRAZY WORD. TJ OTT: MICHAEL'S A GOOD CHEF, HE'S GOOD AT GRILLING THINGS. MIKE OTT: MAKE SOME SANDWICHES OR HOWEVER THE GUYS WANNA EAT 'EM. OH YEAH, NOT ONLY DOES MY COOKING KEEP EVERYBODY FED BUT FOR SOME REASON IT ATTRACTS THE FISH ALSO. I DON'T KNOW THAT SOUNDS ALMOST GOOD AS A ROD SCREAMING. THE SOUND OF SIZZLING. [BEEPING]. TJ OTT: REAL GOOD MARK RIGHT THERE. [REEL UNSPOOLS RAPIDLY]. OH, WE'RE ON! MIKE OTT: YEAH! TJ OTT: BUBBY, I'LL TAKE THOSE PORK CHOPS TO GO, BABY. JESUS, TUNA BRO, JUST WHAT WE NEEDED. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: TRY TO TIRE HIM OUT. TJ OTT: WE GOT HIM UP REAL CLOSE, REAL QUICK AND NOW HE JUST TOOK ABOUT 200 FEET OF LINE OFF, SO PAY ATTENTION HERE, ANOTHER WILD FISH CHANGING DIRECTIONS A LOT. [LAUGHS] HE'S PISSED. TO YOUR RIGHT, TO YOUR RIGHT. MIKE OTT: HE WAS COMING RIGHT AT US FOR A MINUTE. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: COLOR, COLOR, COLOR! MIKE OTT: COME ON, DON'T LOSE HIM. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: TAKE A SHOT! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: COLOR, COLOR, COLOR. MIKE OTT: COME ON, DON'T LOSE HIM. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: TAKE YOUR SHOT! TJ OTT: GOT HIM. GET A GAFFE. GET A TAIL WRAP ON HIM! RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE. YEAH, BABY! WHOO, YEAH! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WHOO! TJ OTT: WE GOT IT DONE, BABY, WHOO, BOTTOM JAW! RIGHT ON THE BUTTON, BRO. 73 INCHES. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WE GOT HIM. TJ OTT: WHAT A HAIR PULLER. IT'S NOT A SEA MONSTER, BUT IT'S A GREAT WAY TO START THE WEEK. ALTHOUGH AFTER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS OF STRUGGLING, WE DEFINITELY NEED A FEW MORE BITES! PA-POW! PETE SPEECHES: ALL RIGHT, HERE'S OUR SPOT, SARAH, RIGHT HERE. WE'RE ONLY A TENTH OF A MILE FROM IT. WE'LL HAVE BRANDON PUT THE ANCHOR DOWN RIGHT THERE. SARAH SPEECHES: ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD. PETE SPEECHES: LET'S HOPE WE GET SOME LUCK FROM YOU! IF NOT, IT'S A LONG SWIM HOME FOR YOU. THIS IS A ONE SHOT DEAL. I GET YOU BOTH TOGETHER ON THE BOAT, DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN. LET'S CATCH SOME FISH AND HAVE SOME FUN. ERIN SPEECHES: AYE-AYE, CAPTAIN. PETE SPEECHES: WE NEED TO CATCH UP. PETE SPEECHES: LAST WEEK, ERIN DIDN'T REALLY PULL HER WEIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, ERIN? ARE YOU CLEANING UP THE BOAT AND DOING USEFUL STUFF? THIS WEEK, I REALLY NEED ERIN TO STEP UP AND PERFORM. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE CLOSE. BRANDON PIERCE: ALL RIGHT. PETE SPEECHES: OKAY, YOU CAN LET IT GO THERE, BRANDON. BRANDON PIERCE: AH [BLEEP]. [GRUNTING]. PETE SPEECHES: WHAT'D YOU DO? BRANDON PIERCE: [BLEEP] A! I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE. PETE SPEECHES: WHAT HAPPENED, BRANDON? BRANDON PIERCE: MY HAND GETS JAMMED UP, MAN. I TRIED TO TELL YOU THAT. PETE SPEECHES: WELL, WHY DON'T YOU STAND, WHY DON'T YOU STAND UP? I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU CAN'T STAND UP AND KEEP YOUR HANDS OUT OF THE RAIL. HE'S SETTING THE ANCHOR AND HE BANGED HIS HAND ON THE SIDE OF THE RAIL. HE SHOULD'VE BEEN WATCHING THE LINE GO THROUGH HIS HAND. SARAH SPEECHES: BRANDON, DO YOU WANT ICE? PETE SPEECHES: IT WAS SORT OF A SILLY MISTAKE. THERE WAS NO REASON FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. BRANDON PIERCE: MY HAND IS STARTING TO HURT A LOT MORE, AND WITHOUT MY HAND I'M PRETTY MUCH USELESS ON THE BOAT. PETE SPEECHES: I'M REALLY SORRY BRANDON HURT HIS HAND, BUT WE'RE BEHIND, AND I GOTTA KEEP FISHING. IT'S VERY FORTUNATE SARAH'S HERE TO HELP OUT, BUT I'M REALLY EXPECTING ERIN TO STEP UP AND PICK UP THE SLACK WHILE BRANDON'S INJURED. UNTANGLE THAT MESS SARAH, JUST LAY IT, LAY IT OUT ON THE FLOOR SO IT'S NOT TANGLED UP. WE'RE TRYING TO GET FISH IN HERE. DAVE CARRARO: ALRIGHTY. SANDRO MANIACI: READY TO ROCK AND ROLL OR WHAT? DAVE CARRARO: LET'S GO, BYE JAVA. JESS: BYE. DAVE CARRARO: BYE, I'LL CALL YOU TONIGHT. WE'LL HAVE RECEPTION.

SANDRO MANIACI: YOU GOT IT? DAVE CARRARO: GOOD GIRL! THE DOG FELL IN THE WATER. I THINK I EARNED SOME BROWNIE POINTS BY "SAVING HER." SANDRO MANIACI: NOW, I'M MORE WET THAN SHE IS. DAVE CARRARO: GOOD GIRL! ANYTHING TO KEEP MY GIRL HAPPY. COME HERE. HOW WAS THAT HUH? NICE AND COOL. COME ON, COME ON LET'S GO. SANDRO MANIACI: I FEEL, I FEEL BETTER NOW.

DAVE CARRARO: ALL RIGHT, WE'LL SEE YOU IN A LITTLE BIT. SANDRO MANIACI: ENOUGH SMOOCHING, LET'S GO! DAVE CARRARO: WE'VE BEEN IN A HORSE RACE ALL SEASON JOCKEYING FOR THAT TOP SPOT. WELL, I HAVE NO DOUBT WE'LL WIND UP ON TOP IN THE END. WE STILL HAVE TO CATCH CONSISTENTLY EVERY WEEK. SO AS MUCH AS I HATE TO LEAVE MY GIRL, IT'S TIME TO GET BACK TO WORK. LET'S GO. SANDRO MANIACI: THE FISH ARE WAITING. [BEEPING]. TJ OTT: OH, GOD. THAT'S A GOOD MARK TOO! WE JUST MARKED A NICE FISH. RIGHT IN THE ZONE WHERE ALL OUR BAITS ARE. EH, WE DON'T HAVE A BENT ROD, SO. IT'S OUR FIRST DAY OUT ON THE WATER AND WE'VE ALREADY GOT A FISH. IT'S A GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE KNOW THERE'S A LONG WAYS TO GO TO REALLY MAKE THIS SEASON HAPPEN SUCCESSFULLY. GOD, AND HE CAME RIGHT TO THE BAIT, DUDE! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: I KNOW, THAT ONE EARLIER WAS ALL OVER IT. HE CAME BACK LIKE THREE TIMES AND THEN IT WASN'T HAPPENING. COME ON, MAN!

LANCE SISTARE: THAT'S COMMERCIAL HAIR, MAN. YOU ONLY GET THAT FROM COMMERCIAL FISHING. WE'RE NOT EVEN MARKING ANY FISH. SO RIGHT NOW I GOT NOTHING BETTER TO DO THAN TO WATCH BRAD PLAY WITH HIS HAIR. BRAD KRASOWSKI: IT'S LIKE UNTANGLING A NET. YOU HAVE TO COMB IT A FEW TIMES A DAY OR IT'LL TURN INTO A RASTAFARIAN LIKE TJ. LANCE SISTARE: YOU GONNA START DYING IT SOON? BRAD KRASOWSKI: YEAH.
