 At the start of week 7, Fishing Vessel Tuna Dot Com leads the fleet. But last season's champion, Hard Merchandise and family operation, Hot Tuna, are not far behind. TYLER: Another day in paradise. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DRAKE: All right. What do you want for breakfast? TYLER: Three rods stretching! DRAKE: I'm back on the Pinwheel after a trip to the hospital. My doctor gave me a look-over, said I'll be good to fish, and I'm feeling good and ready to catch some giants again. [BEEPING SOUND] TYLER: We're marking. It's week seven and the Pinwheel only has four fish. But now I have both Drake and Travis on the back deck. The rest of the fleet better stand back, because the Pinwheel's at full strength, and we're coming for the top spot. Come on! Eat that bait! Marking 'em big time! DRAKE: We're on. TYLER: Got him on, dude. We got to make this count, bro. Come on, now. Woo! Got him on first thing in the morning. He's got some weight. He's bigger than we think. No doubt about it. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! DRAKE: Hey! TYLER: Those are big, violent headshakes he's doing. DRAKE: Big, violent headshakes. He's definitely feeling like he could be a 400-pounder right now TYLER: He's 80-incher, bro! Pull him in. Come on. DRAKE: Coming up. He's coming up. TYLER: We need this tuna! DRAKE: It is, in fact, a tuna. TYLER: Really want to catch this one. TYLER: Oh! We lost him! [Bleep]! Pulled the hook. DRAKE: Dammit. TRAVIS: We didn't put enough glue on that one. TYLER: It sucks, what are you going to do? It absolutely sucks. That's why you're out here, working for it, and you pull a hook. DRAKE: Right at the boat, too. Had him circling. Perfect color, for like 5 minutes. Ugh! TYLER: It's definitely a kick in the nuts. We really could use that fish. This isn't how I wanted to start out the first trip with a full crew. I just hope that it's not a sign of things to come. Why do I even wake up in the [bleep] morning? TJ: Hey, are you on there, Dave? DAVE: I hear you loud and clear now, TJ. TJ: Oh! Have you marked one? DAVE: No. TYLER:It's so annoying to listen to TJ and Dot Com talking. TJ: You'll get one at dark, you'll get one in the morning. You'll be coming back out here next week. DAVE: I'm never going again. This is my last trip, ever. TJ: You're so full of crap. DAVE: I mean it this time. I'm sketching up the 'for sale' sign right now on my iPhone. I got an app for that. SANDRO: That's the funniest thing I've ever heard you say. TYLER: God, [BLEEP]. I've known TJ since I was 18 years old. TJ to work with Dot Com and share information that Dot Com doesn't know about when, you know maybe you could work with me a little bit? TJ: What did Sandro have to say about this? DAVE: Sandro just offered me a thousand dollars to take him home. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ TYLER: It makes me sick and it really shows me that TJ's working with my biggest enemy on the water. That almost makes TJ my second biggest. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Dave dot-douche. PAUL: ♪ Da, da, da, da, da, la, la, la, la, la, la. ♪ I'm not 20 years old anymore, man. It's hard. [LAUGHS] I mean, a lot of people come and go in this business. It's not made for everybody, but it's a tough job. People think it's just about coming out and catching fish. It's not that. You got to get along. You got to deal with each other's living habits, you know what I mean? Three weeks ago, things made a turn for the worse with Brad, and Lance, and me. LANCE: I'm asking you one simple thing and you flip the [bleep] out. PAUL: And them guys quit. Where are you? I fished solo for a week with no luck. Think I just lost him. [Bleep]! And last week, I had to borrow Geordie off the Dot Com, so I could get some fish on my boat. Yeah! We got him! It's been rough but things are gonna turn. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ I got my crew back. [LAUGHS] BRAD: How you feel being back, Lance? LANCE: Still a little skeptical, you know. PAUL: It's not a one-guy team. Brady doesn't win the football games by himself. [LAUGHS] He needs a receiver, and he needs a blocker. You have to have good guys. You got to have your team. BRAD: We don't need any more [bleep]. We're just here to fish, you know? LANCE: Just want to catch fish, dude. That's it, without the [bleep]. I still need to provide for my family. So it's my job to suck it up, and get back on this boat, and try to put some fish on the deck. PAUL: So glad the guys are back. I know I got a reputation of not being able to keep a crew for the whole season, but I'm going to fix that. LANCE: It'd really help out if we get a fish today. BRAD: Eh, that'll calm some nerves. This is Paul's final chance to show me he can successfully captain this boat. If we fail this trip out, I'm done for good with Paul. I really hope it works out this time. LANCE: Yeah, me too, man. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Feel like you got one more lucky fish left in you? JOE: Yeah, hopefully I can squeeze one more. DAVE: Last trip out, Jay and I failed to catch any fish. But this week, we got Joe back, so we're feeling really good. And if we catch fish with Joe today, this time we're just gonna chain him to the boat so he can't be taking any more days off. Since he was in pull-ups, Joe has always been my good luck charm. So I'm glad he's back this week. [BEEPING SOUND] JASON: There he is, at 12:00 JOE: It's great that my dad thinks that I'm a good luck charm, and all. But, without everyone, we wouldn't be putting fish onboard. [BEEPING SOUND] We're on, we're on, we're on. DAVE: We're on. There's a fish! There you go! It looks like it might be! JASON: Reel, reel, reel! DAVE: We on there? JOE: Yeah. DAVE: What does it feel like, Joe? JOE: I don't know. Here, here get him. I think it's a fish. We're not really sure how big it is. JASON: Dave. DAVE: Huh? JASON: Hey I think we're gonna need a bigger boat. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ That's a screamer! Here comes a lightning storm, too. DAVE: You don't have to worry, guys. Lightning is only dangerous if you're on a boat. JASON: Lightning going on over there. See that? [LIGHTNING SOUNG] It's going into darkness. Got a little chop on the seas. We're gonna need luck on our side to land this one. Lady luck. DAVE: Good work, boys. Keep it up, and we're gonna get him. You're doing great back there. The real challenge to fishing at night is a loss of visibility. You can't see stuff coming at you from out of the darkness. JASON: Watch this! Here he comes! JOE: Whoa! Big wave, big wave! DAVE: The seas are angry. JOE: We just got to get him to the boat, and get him close enough to stick a dart in him. JASON: Oh! DAVE: Rinse? Charged the boat again. JOE: Oh! Oh, there he is, right on top. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. There he is! JASON: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! I see him! DAVE: There he is, right there! We're getting close! Coming back. Doing good. Pull him up, pull him up, pull him up, pull him up, pull him up. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Nailed him! Back off from the drag, grab the harpoon. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Joey? Pick it up. JASON: Yeah! JOE: We got him. DAVE: Good job, boys! JOE: Another one for the Merch! DAVE: Well done, guys! JASON: Good job, team! Good job, team! JOE: Good job, another one for the Merch! Money, team. Let's go. DAVE: All right. Here comes the old-man power. DAVE: All right. JASON: That's a nice fish. DAVE: Yep. What does it say, Joe? JOE: Eighty-six. Right on the money. JASON: I got to give it to him. When Joe comes out with us, the hard Merch always has good luck. DAVE: Way to be there, Joe. He's back. JOE: Coming in hard. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ TYLER: Look who it is? Dave dot-douche! What do you say we go have a little word with Dot Com, dude? Screw this Dot Com guy. I've had enough of his [bleep]. It just doesn't make any sense to me that TJ and Dot Com are talking. To see TJ now working with Dot Com after Dot Com's burned him in the past, how can TJ be friends with this douchebag? He's just gonna use him for info and then lie to him again. I'm really upset with Dave right now, and I really wanna give him a piece of my mind. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Geordie, give me my phone, quick. GEORDIE: Oh, God. DAVE: Hand me my phone quick. GEORDIE: I'm coming. DRAKE: My first trip back is about to get a whole lot more interesting. TYLER: Where's your fearless leader? ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Oh, there you are. Hey, congratulations on your new boat. DAVE: Are you serious? TYLER: You know what? You're a mean guy. [Bleep] this guy. I'm cutting your lines, man. DAVE: Don't do it! Don't do it, Tyler. Hey! When we get to the dock, you come and see me. None of this water. TYLER: Why? You got to hit me in the face with a poly-ball? DAVE: You just did damage. You just messed with somebody's gear! You're gonna get it, now. TYLER: You're threatening me again? DAVE: You just got busted! You don't touch each other's gear out in the water. That's the worst thing you can possibly do. I could take a lot of things from Tyler. Sticks and stones, calling me names, I don't care. But what he did, cutting my lines. That's crossing the line. Period. [RINGTONE] TJ: What's going on? DAVE: The kid just came up to us, spun around and started stripping the line off our reel and then he cut it. TJ: What kid? Tyler? DAVE: Tyler, yeah. It's got to stop, man. TJ: He's reckless, you're just gonna have to handle it man. And the fact that you're catching a lot more fish has just got him so nutted up. He can't take it and this is what he's resorting it to. DAVE: I mean, I don't know, what do you, what do you do? TJ: I wouldn't go beat his ass. I would take it to the authorities first. I mean, I, did you call the Coast Guard? DAVE: TJ's right. I can't keep letting this stuff go. All right. See you, thanks, TJ. Thanks for getting my back. TJ: All right, you got it. DAVE: Hey, Coast Guard Gloucester, Tuna Dot Com. TJ: He's already got numerous strikes against him, so you know what? This could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Eh, eh, they're just gonna have, that's it. He'll be banned from Gloucester. He won't be able to come back in here. DAVE: I need to report an incident. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ PETE: Out whale watching. Tired of waiting, just need a bite. Too many slow days. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ I really expected to have a lot more fish than three by this time in the season. I've never had a run of slow fishing that's been this long, it's been very difficult. BRANDON: Even the whales are bored. The fish are turned off right now and we're just trying to wait them out. My name's Erin. I read books all day. ERIN: You're funny. BRANDON: It can be frustrating. She's part of the crew and we rely on her to do her share of the work. I would like to see her step it up just a little bit more. ERIN: I'm not helping you. BRANDON: Huh? You're not helping me because you read books all day? ERIN: Engaging my mind. PETE: Erin's not quite where I want her to be seven weeks in the season. But she has to stay focused on the fishing. ERIN: I know that my dad would like to see me be a little more, have a little like more advanced knowledge, you know what I'm saying? I'm telling you, I'm so addicted to this stupid game. When there's downtime on the boat, I really do like to read. Sometimes I mess around on my phone or kill flies. See ya, wouldn't want to be ya. BRANDON: This can't go on forever I've got to talk to the captain. So cap, I know, you know, Erin's new and she's got a lot to learn still, but I've just noticed she's, kind of, been complacent at times. I'm just wondering if maybe you might mind having a word with her and see if she might putting down the phone sometimes and giving me a hand. PETE: She could do more. BRANDON: Just, uh, just a little bit extra would help out a long ways. You know? PETE: Well, we got to work as a team, you know that. BRANDON: Hopefully something will change, because this isn't a cruise ship. PETE: Hey, what are you doing right now, kiddo? ERIN: Nothing. PETE: All right. Let's, help me check rods. Be useful. ERIN: Ugh. TYLER: Oh, no. Dot Com called the Coast Guard. Yo, the Coast Guard is coming. TRAVIS: You think that [bleep] called the Coast Guard on you? TYLER: Yeah. DAVE: See that boat there? All my friends are on that boat. Sent that out just for us. SANDRO: Safety's a big issue out here and messing with people's [bleep] you know, you just don't do it. TYLER: We're getting paid by the Coast Guard. DAVE: This'll make my stress take a turn for the better right now. Yeah, I, I'll be able to sleep now. Oh yeah, they're on there. I hope he goes down. SANDRO: [Bleep] just got really real. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ TYLER: Yes, sir, Tyler. COAST GUARD: All right. TYLER: You want me to just get my book out? DAVE: Right now just watching this, I'm getting pleasure. TYLER: He threw a weight at us. Twelve ounce weight and then we proceeded to cut one of his tuna lines. SANDRO: Pretty much screwed himself, you know, it's, there's no need for this. DAVE: Just had enough with that kid. I had enough. TYLER: Yes, sir. Oh, absolutely. COAST GUARD: All right. GEORDIE: I hope he's wearing a diaper cause I get you a hundred dollars, he just [bleep] himself. TYLER: Bye, guys. He's a snitch just like I said, dude. He called the Coast Guard. DRAKE: What a crybaby. TYLER: He called the Coast Guard. That's like running to the principal's office. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Here he comes. DRAKE: We're steaming over to Dave right now and I have no idea what Tyler is going to do. TYLER: [Bleep] you, Dot Com. [Bleep] you. TRAVIS: The coastguard just told us to stay away from Dot Com and already Tyler's stirring the pot. DAVE: Oh, the kid's nuts. TYLER: Come on, tough guy. Come on. DAVE: Is he serious? TYLER: Come on, tough guy. Come on. Come on. You're a [bleep] loser. No one likes you, bro. No one. TRAVIS: I just hope he hasn't started a war that he can't finish. SANDRO: Did you see his hat, dude? GEORDIE: Do you know who wears that hat? The kind of person who's going right off the edge. [LAUGHING] DAVE: I think he's really losing it. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Well, we're sitting here waiting. Hopefully, we can make something happen at night. It didn't happen during the day. And this season it definitely seems like nighttime is the right time. [BEEPING SOUND] JASON: We got a big mark. We're marking. We're marking. DAVE: Boy, if I could hear that rod go to life now, I'd be a happy camper. JASON: Here he comes. Come on, baby. Come on. JOE: Right on 20. DAVE: Going right down to that whiting. Come on, fish.

Hold him to the reel. Got to get the [inaudible] out of here. DAVE: [Inaudible]... It's midnight, 12:00 Charlie, I guess we call this one. Certainly seems like a good fish. We're just hoping we can put them on the deck. JASON: This is a big and tricky fish. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ JOE: All right. Go. Everyone else is sleeping right now and we're fighting a fish. The bait's a little trickier. It's always, it's always tougher to fight them at night. DAVE: I love the smell of tuna in the morning. JOE: I couldn't think of much more I'd rather be doing at 2:00 in the morning than fighting a Bluefin tuna right now, that's for sure. DAVE: Come on. Go down. JASON: Ready? JOE: Yeah, ready. JASON: Coming under the boat. JOE: Going under the boat. He's going under the boat. JASON AND JOE: Go forward. JASON: Gonna breach. Shaking his head out there. DAVE: Right at four.

DAVE: Yeah. JOE: That was [bleep] scary. He charged right at the boat, we saw him right there. He went right under for the prop. DAVE: Couple inches under the surface. JOE: That was scary. This fish doesn't wanna give up. We're not going to give up either, though till I drop cold dead on the floor, we're gonna fight this fish. DAVE: All right, guys. He's down and dirty now. Now we're gonna get him. We've been fighting this fish now, and it looks like finally, he's getting tired enough where we might get a shot with the harpoon. JASON: Get ready, Joe. DAVE: Keep an eye out for him on the surface here. JOE: Yeah, there he is, right on that surface. JASON: Here he comes. DAVE: Make a nice shot, boys.

And before I could even turn around, Jay had stuck that fish with a second harpoon. It's because of those guys we got this fish on the boat. JASON: Watch yourself, Joe. Good job. Good job. Good job, dude. Nice fish. DAVE: We had to fight for this fish though, that's for sure. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Ninety-nine and a quarter. I'm definitely happy to have the whole A-team back together again.

I thought I had one on the swivel, too. PAUL: This is how fishing should be. Wow, is there a lot of bait down there. We finally got some through some obstacles. We're all back on track. Everyone's doing their job. The bottom line is putting meat on the deck. We really, really need to catch a fish. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ LANCE: He's a whole new person out here. It's not the Paul I've known. Paul's showing improvements. But we still don't have a fish this week. If he doesn't put us on the meat, we're out of here. BRAD: Just give it some time here. LANCE: I just want to catch fish, dude.

But when I'm back there, watch me. I get frustrated when I think that Erin's not focused on the, the task at hand. I feel everybody should be focused on getting that fish. I know there's a learning curve. But we're at seven weeks into the season, and I am frustrated that she's still learning some of the things I thought she would have under her belt by now. BRANDON: This isn't, this isn't a job for everyone. And we got to make the best of it when it happens. PETE: Are you awake and ready for me? ERIN: Yup. That's why I'm.

I'm very happy we caught this fish. But Erin's got to step up and focus more so it doesn't cost us a fish in the future. In she goes. Erin, get out here and help us, please. DAVE: You know what? It's dead today, there's not much happening. This would be a great day to go in with two fish to the buyer, but first, it's so hot right now, I decide I need to cool off.

TRAVIS: Ah! Kiss my ass, dude. They just brought it in. TYLER: Ugh! TRAVIS: Looks like a good fish. TYLER: It's so brutal knowing that Dot Com just lands a fish, and our bite turned into a shark. There's no question in my mind, week 7 of the tuna-fishing season was a disaster for the Pinwheel. GEORDIE: All right! There we go. DAVE: Nice, yeah. I just got fish on the... GEORDIE: That'll work. Yes. DAVE: We got our ninth fish of the season. And better yet, we did it right in front of the punk-wheel. He got exactly what he deserves. GEORDIE: We got him! DAVE: We got him.

You got to, and there's, like, no herring here. BRANDON: It's the end of the week, there's still a bunch of work to do, and Erin isn't helping us out. PETE: I'm starting to regret having Erin on the boat. She's a little slower assimilating than I expected. You know, it's important that the boat stays profitable and everybody pulls their weight. Hey, drop into that bait, quick! Hurry up! Both of ya! ERIN: I'm going as fast as I can! PETE: You missed 'em. Never mind. You missed them. ERIN: No. I have them on. PETE: When I say, Hurry, you don't walk to the rod, you run to the rod. ERIN: I did. My dad has a lot of knowledge and he likes to pass that on to me. And I do listen to the best of my ability, but it's not all part of my world. PETE: Before you go down for a nap, I hope you check these lines. Hey! Gyaah! ERIN: Oh, come on! No, no, no, no! PETE: You got to pay attention better. You just gotta. ERIN: How was I, how was I supposed to stop that? PETE: Pull it faster when you see 'em comin'! Just pay attention. ERIN: We don't have a lot of herring left in the tank, so the fact that I just let a bait get eaten by a seagull is not making my dad happy at all. PETE: Get your game on! Pay attention. Be observant. All right? Shut that off. ERIN: I'm sorry! PETE: Yeah! Pay attention. That should, throw it on the floor. I'll get it. ERIN: I pulled it as fast as I could! PETE: You weren't lookin' at what was goin' on. He saw the birds before you! Just, just don't argue with me. ERIN: It's frustrating to be yelled at, at, in any situation. I feel like I'm trying so hard to do the right thing, and to be good at it, and I'm just not. PETE: Go lay down. ERIN: No, it's fine. I'll wait. PETE: No. Go lay down, now! I'm saying. Just go! And come back up when you can pay attention, rested. ERIN: Ugh! PETE: I'll take care of this. ERIN: When he says, Go lay down, I feel like I'm being spoken to like a dog. I know that my dad and Brandon are not very happy with me right now. [CRYING] ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ BRAD: Where do we got our rigging needles? PAUL: There's a rigging needle in that crimp tray.
