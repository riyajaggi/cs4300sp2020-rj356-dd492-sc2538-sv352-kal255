 Wicked Tuna (2012–…): Season 5, Episode 11 - Riders in the Storm - full transcript 
 When a violent storm rolls in, the Gloucester captains face a tough decision at a critical time: Do they fish ... or flee? Captains Dave Marciano of the Hard Merchandise and Dave Carraro of FV-Tuna.com both feel that braving the weather is a risk worth taking, as the rolling seas may well bring the bite to the surface. For Paul Hebert, of the Wicked Pissah, it is critical to stay on the water.

 DAVE MARCIANO: THEY'RE SCREAMING! NARRATOR: CATCHING... SANDRO MANIACI: WHOA, WHOO! ERIN SPEECHES: OH, MY GOD, DAD! NARRATOR: WICKED TUNA. PAUL HEBERT: ONE WRONG WAVE AND YOU'RE DONE. NARRATOR: WITH FIVE WEEKS OF FISHING LEFT TO GO, LAST WEEK'S CHAMP HARD MERCHANDISE IS IN CLOSE ON THEIR HEELS. PINWHEEL AND ERIN & SARAH CONTINUE TO STRAGGLE BEHIND THE FLEET. REPORTER: AND NOW, THE SYNOPSIS AND FORECAST FOR THE FOLLOWING. SYNOPSIS FOR NEW ENGLAND WATERS, A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORWEST TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. WEST TO SOUTHWEST WINDS 15 TO 25 KNOTS. SEAS FOUR TO SEVEN FEET. SOME THUNDERSTORMS MAY PRODUCE HEAVY RAINFALL UNTIL MIDNIGHT. PAUL HEBERT: IT'S THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM RIGHT HERE. WE GOT A LITTLE WEATHER WINDOW SO, IT'S GONNA BLOW 50, NORTHEAST. IT'S GONNA SCREAM! BRAD KRASOWSKI: WHOO-HOO! DAVE MARCIANO: ALL I CAN I SAY IS, ARE YOU FEELING LUCKY PUNKS? PRESSURE'S ON. WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THINGS HAPPEN AND HAPPEN FAST HERE. GENERALLY, WHEN IT STARTS GETTING NASTY OUT, YOU GOT A LOW PRESSURE COMING. THAT LOW PRESSURE CAN TRIGGER THE FISH INTO A FEEDING FRENZY. THE QUESTION IS, HOW LOW CAN YOU GO BEFORE IT GETS TOO NASTY AND YOU JUST NEED TO BE OUT OF HARM'S WAY. COME ON, FISH. SANDRO MANIACI: A LITTLE SPORTY OUT HERE TO TODAY. DAVE CARRARO: IN EIGHT HOURS, THE WEATHER IS GONNA GET SUPER BAD. WHEN THE BITE'S GOOD AND YOU'RE COMING DOWN TOWARDS THE END OF THE SEASON, WE DO PUSH THE LIMITS. OUR PLAN THIS WEEK IS TO GET AHEAD THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. WEATHER IS A FACTOR. WEATHER IS A RISK. HOWEVER, IT'S A RISK WE'RE WILLING TO TAKE. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: IT'S DEFINITELY STARTING TO GET A LITTLE ROUGH OUT, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. I SEE WE DEFINITELY GOT SOME STORM CLOUDS MOVING IN, MIGHT GET A LITTLE BIT OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? YOU GOT TO STAY OUT HERE AND GRIND. GOOD THING THEY MADE RAIN GEAR. TRAVIS BROWN: (BLEEP), DAMN SON OF A BITCH! DUDE, I ALMOST GOT (BLEEP) CRUSHED BY THE BOX. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WHOO-WEE, THERE'S A GOOD ONE. HOLD ON. MIKE OTT: HOLD ON, HOLD ON. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: TJ FELL DOWN. YOU ALL RIGHT? TJ OTT: THIS IS WHAT FISHERMEN IN GLOUCESTER HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS YOU KNOW IT IS THE REALITY OF THE JOB YOU'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT IN BAD WEATHER, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FISH SOME ROUGH STUFF TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. [BEEPING] BIG MARK! LAST WEEK, WE HAD A FIRE SCARE ON BOARD THAT SENT UP IN EARLY. WHERE'S IT COMING FROM? MIKE OTT: I DON'T KNOW! TJ OTT: SO WE'RE DESPERATE TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME BEFORE THE WEATHER TURNS. EVERY BOAT OUT HERE IS TRYING TO CATCH AS MUCH AS THEY CAN TODAY BEFORE IT GETS UNBEARABLE. THEY'RE ALL OVER THE SCREEN. GET THAT ONE OUT. RIGHT TO 120. BIG MARK! WATCH THE DOWN ROD, WATCH THE DOWN ROD. [REEL UNSPOOLING RAPIDLY]. TJ OTT: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! WATCH IT, WATCH IT, WATCH IT! WE GOT THEM ON BABY, WHOO! MIKE OTT: HOLD ON. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WATCH THIS WAVE, WATCH THIS WAVE! TJ OTT: IT'S REALLY ROUGH, THERE'S BOATS AROUND US, THERE'S LOBSTER GEAR. EVERYONE HAS TO BE ON THEIR A GAME IN CONDITIONS LIKE THIS WHEN IT'S ROUGH. BRAD KRASOWSKI: THEY GOT THEM ON, TJ AND THEM. THEY'RE ALL GOING CRAZY. PAUL HEBERT: CAN'T SEE. BRAD KRASOWSKI: OH, MY GOD! PAUL HEBERT: HOLD ON. BRAD KRASOWSKI: WE'RE GONNA FLIP OVER. PAUL HEBERT: YEP, YOU'RE RIGHT DUDE. HE'S GOT ONE ON THE LINE. TJ OTT: OH (BLEEP) HANG ON, WHEW! DOG'S INSIDE? MIKE OTT: YEAH, I LOCKED HIM IN. [BARKING] TJ OTT: WATCH HIS HEAD SHAKES. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: OH! TJ OTT: OH, GOD, (BLEEP)! MIKE OTT: SHAKING HIS HEAD LIKE THAT. ACTING WEIRD SHAKING HIS HEAD A LOT. TJ OTT: JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE HIM LICKED, HE'S GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING LEFT FOR YOU, HUH? MIKE OTT: ROD'S BOUNCING A LOT. HE'S EITHER SHAKING HIS HEAD OR HE'S STARTING TO GO DOWN DEEP NOW. THERE HE IS GLOWING. TJ OTT: I WANT A GOOD SHOT. MICHAEL, GET READY WITH THE HARPOON. MIKE OTT: GOT IT RIGHT HERE. TJ OTT: SWING IT BACK TO YOUR RIGHT. THE ROUGH SEA CONDITIONS AND THE BOAT MOVING AROUND AND POPPING UP AND DOWN ON THE BIGGER WAVES DEFINITELY MAKES IT HARDER TO LAND A FISH. I'M PRAYING THESE WAVES DON'T SCREW US WHEN IT COMES TIME TO HARPOON IT. COME ON REEL, REEL! BRING HIM TO YOU, COME ON. GOT HIM, GET A GAFFE! [INAUDIBLE] RIGHT HERE, ON MY RIGHT. TAIL GAFF, I GOT HIM GOOD. MIKE OTT: I GOT HIM, I GOT HIM. LIFT HIM UP. [INAUDIBLE] TJ OTT: OUT, OUT, OUT. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: NICE WORK, GUYS. NICE WORK, WHOO! TJ OTT: THAT WAS A TOUGH MAN. WE GOT HIM. OH, WE GOT HIM, WE GOT HIM! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: IT'S PRETTY BIG TO BE TOUGH. TJ OTT: OH, END RESULTS RIGHT THERE, BABY! PA-POW! WHEW, THANKS FOR PLAYING. THERE'S BLUE GOLD HANGING FROM THE CLEAT BACK THERE AND WE'RE STOKED. DAVE MARCIANO: HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET A TURN HERE TODAY. PAUL HEBERT: YOU KNOW, ANY BOAT THAT CATCHES ONE DRIVES US TO FISH HARDER LIKE, "OH, MAN WE NEED ONE." THAT'S WHY WE'RE SITTING OUT HERE BROADSIDING IN THIS CRAP, YOU KNOW? DAVE CARRARO: TJ JUST GOT 'EM. SANDRO MANIACI: WOW, HOW ABOUT THEM APPLES? DAVE CARRARO: WE'LL GET 'EM. THE PLUS SIDE OF ROUGH WEATHER IS WHEN IT'S BIG AND IT'S PITCHIN' AND IT'S ROLLING THE WIND IS BLOWING, THAT'S WHEN THE BITE MOST OF THE TIME IS ON. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STICK IT OUT AND WAIT IT OUT. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: 88 ON THE BUTTON! TJ OTT: THAT'S PERFECT BABY! I'M GLAD TO HAVE THIS GUY ABOARD. WELCOME TO THE HOT TUNA, BABY! REPORTER: SOME THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS, SMALL HAIL AND HEAVY RAINFALL. WIND GUST UP TO 40 MILES PER HOUR CAN BE EXPECTED... PETE SPEECHES: THE STORM'S GETTING CLOSER. HOPE WE GET A BITE BEFORE THE WEATHER. WE REALLY NEED TO PRODUCE SOMETHING HERE. THE PRESSURE BECOMES GREATER AND GREATER ON A CAPTAIN. WE'RE $4,000 IN THE HOLE STARTING OUT THIS TRIP AND I'VE GOT SAY. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST SEASONS I'VE HAD. OH, PULLED THE HOOK. PAIN IN THE ASS. IT'S A SHARK. WE DIDN'T NEED THAT HAPPEN, THAT'S FOR SURE. ERIN YOU GOT A COUPLE BALLOONS OR A BAG OR SOMETHING? WE DON'T HAVE OUR FIRST MATE, BRANDON, THIS WEEK AND THE EXTRA STRESS THAT PUTS ON ME IS TREMENDOUS. ERIN! ESPECIALLY WITH ROUGH WEATHER COMING. ERIN SPEECHES: MY DAD IS UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO STRESSED. PETE SPEECHES: FROM NOW ON PUT YOUR PANTS AND YOUR BOOTS ON. ROLL YOUR PANTS DOWN YOUR BOOT SO YOU CAN JUMP IN YOUR BOOTS AND PULL YOUR PANTS UP. ERIN SPEECHES: IF WE DON'T DO WELL THIS SEASON, MY DAD IS NOT GONNA ABLE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE AND MY SISTER'S TUITION AND THAT COULD AFFECT HER ABILITY TO GO TO COLLEGE. PETE SPEECHES: YOU'VE GOT TO GO FASTER. ERIN SPEECHES: I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HIM BUT I KNOW THAT ONE GOOD FISH CAN TURN EVERYTHING FOR US. PETE SPEECHES: BRING ANOTHER BAG NOW. ERIN SPEECHES: WE'RE MARKING. [BEEPING]. [REEL UNSPOOLS RAPIDLY]. PETE SPEECHES: WE'RE ON, GET THAT ROD OUT OF THE WAY! THAT ONE RIGHT THERE, YEAH! QUICKLY, REEL ON IT! KEEP THAT ROD TIGHT! [REEL UNSPOOLING] GET ON THE CONTROLS, PUT IT IN FORWARD. A LITTLE BIT LEFT! HURRY UP, QUICK BUMP! NEUTRAL! OKAY, FORWARD RIGHT, HON. WE'RE BEHIND, WE NEED THE PAYCHECK, WE NEED THE BOOST. HOPEFULLY, THE TUNA GODS WILL BE NICE TO ME NOW. HE'S CUTTING ACROSS THE BOW. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RUN FORWARD ON HIM. ERIN SPEECHES: LOOK AT THAT BEND, THIS THING IS HUGE. PETE SPEECHES: HARD RIGHT. ERIN SPEECHES: RIGHT. PETE SPEECHES: I THINK THIS FISH MIGHT HAVE SEEN A BOAT BEFORE. HE'S A BIG ONE THE WAY HE'S FIGHTING. I GOT COLOR... [LOUD SNAP] [PAINFUL GRUNT] ERIN SPEECHES: OH MY GOD, DAD! DAD, ARE YOU OKAY? PETE SPEECHES: I GOT COLOR! [LOUD SNAP] [PAINFUL GRUNT] ERIN SPEECHES: OH, MY GOD, DAD! DAD, ARE YOU OKAY? DAD, ARE YOU HURT? PETE SPEECHES: SORRY, THAT WAS MY FAULT. ERIN SPEECHES: DAD, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. PETE SPEECHES: BIG (BLEEP) FISH. IT'S RIGHT THERE, RIGHT (BLEEP) THERE. ♪ ♪ YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT ONE HURTS. YOU JUST DON'T (BLEEP) KNOW. I CAN'T BELIEVE I LOST HIM. HE WAS RIGHT THERE. I COULD HAVE JUMPED ON HIS BACK. IF I DIDN'T FALL DOWN, I COULD HAVE SAVED HIM. I HATE MYSELF RIGHT NOW. HOLY (BLEEP). OH, MY WORD. ENOUGH TO MAKE A GROWN MAN CRY. I LOST HIM RIGHT AT THE BOAT. BROKE THE LEADER. RIGHT, I HAD THE HARPOON UP HE WAS RIGHT THERE AND THEN I FELL AND I COULDN'T SAVE HIM. I SLIPPED AND FELL PUSHING THE ROD OFF THE LEADER BROKE. GREAT BIG FISH. YOU KNOW, 120-INCHER IT WAS HUGE. DAVE CARRARO: WOW, MAN. DAVE MARCIANO: PETE SPEECHES IS A GOOD FISHERMAN BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS YEAR, HE'S JUST HAVING A TOUGH SEASON. I KNOW ALL ABOUT HAVING BAD SEASONS BUT WE JUST KEPT PLUGGING AWAY AND THAT'S WHAT PETE'S GOT TO DO TOO. 'CAUSE THE MOMENT YOU GET DOWN ON YOURSELF, THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE FINISHED. PETE SPEECHES: I'M REALLY SORRY, HONEY, I LET YOU DOWN ON THAT ONE. BECAUSE I HAVE ERIN WITH ME YOU KNOW I WANT TO BE THE HERO, YOU KNOW, AS MY FATHER IS REALLY GOOD AT WHAT HE DOES. I'VE NEVER HAD A RUN OF SLOW FISHING THIS LONG, THAT'S HARD ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH AND THEN FEELING LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT OF FAILURE WITH YOUR DAUGHTER ON THE BOAT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE. I SHOULD NEVER HAVE LOST THAT FISH EVER. MAN WHAT A (BLEEP) SEASON. TJ OTT: WHAT'S UP SCOTT-SO? SCOTT: WHAT'S GOING ON GUYS? TJ OTT: WE GOT ONE FOR YOU BRO, JUST ONE. SCOTT: IT'S ALL RIGHT. TJ OTT: HOPE YOU BROUGHT A LOT OF MONEY, DUDE, WE NEED IT. SCOTT: ALL RIGHT, WELL LET ME SEE WHAT I CAN DO FOR YOU. TJ OTT: WHAT DO YOU GOT, SCOTT-SO? SCOTT: 347 POUNDS. TJ OTT: WE'LL TAKE IT. A TUNA BUYER LIKES TO LOOK FOR A LOT OF FAT, GOOD RED COLOR AND A GOOD CORE. WHAT DO SAY SCOTTY? WHAT DO WE GOT BOY, WHAT DO WE GOT? THOSE ARE REALLY THE KEYS TO A GREAT PRICE SO I'M HOPING THIS FISH IS A DIAMOND. SCOTT: THIS FISH RIGHT HERE CONSIDERING THE CORE IS GOOD YOU KNOW A RED MEAT FISH. THIS FISH WILL EASILY GET YOU GUYS $19 A POUND. TJ OTT: ALL RIGHT, SCOTT-SO! MIKE OTT: WHOO! TJ OTT: ALL RIGHT, THANKS MAN. SCOTT: ALL RIGHT MAN, ALL RIGHT. TJ OTT: WE WERE EXTREMELY FORTUNATE LANDING THIS FISH. IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA HELP WITH MY STRESS LEVELS AND IT'S ALSO HAS MADE THE HOT TUNA A TOP THREE CONTENDER. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WE'LL BE BACK WITH SOME MORE HOPEFULLY. TJ OTT: THE FISH BEFORE THE STORM, PA-POW! REPORTER: STRONG WIND GUSTS AND ROUGH SEAS CAN BE EXPECTED. STAY CLOSE TO SHORE UNTIL THE STORM PASSES. DAVE CARRARO: THE CLOUDS ARE MOVING IN, THE WIND'S STARTING TO PICK UP, THE STORM IS MOST DEFINITELY APPROACHING. [BEEPING] THERE HE IS. GEORDIE SOUSA: WHOA! SANDRO MANIACI: OH, MY GOD! GEORDIE SOUSA: DUDE, WHOA! DAVE CARRARO: JUMBOS. SANDRO MANIACI: THAT IS A WORLD RECORD RIGHT THERE MAN. DAVE CARRARO: WOW, WE KNOW THERE'S WEATHER COMING. BUT WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO RIDE IT OUT. RIGHT NOW WE'RE THE NUMBER 2 BOAT IN THE FLEET AND WE'RE PREPARED TO FISH THROUGH ANYTHING TO GET BACK ON TOP. SANDRO MANIACI: HILARIOUS, OH, GOD. WE'RE GOING OFF, WE'RE GOING OFF. DAVE CARRARO: COME ON, COME ON, COME ON, GO! GEORDIE SOUSA: STILL COMING, 90 COMING UP. DAVE CARRARO: THERE, HE'S GOT IT. HE'S GOT IT, HE'S GOT IT! SANDRO MANIACI: WE GOT A DOUBLE, WE'RE DOUBLED UP! DAVE CARRARO: GO, GET OFF, GET OFF. GEORDIE SOUSA: WE GOT A DOUBLE. SANDRO MANIACI: DO YOUR THING. DAVE CARRARO: LET'S BREAK IT OFF. DAVE CARRARO: DOUBLED UP! SANDRO MANIACI: YOU'RE OFF? DAVE CARRARO: YEAH, WE'RE OFF. HERE GEORDIE, CLEAR THIS. GEORDIE SOUSA: (BLEEP) WHAT WAS THAT? DAVE CARRARO: DOUBLED UP! SANDRO MANIACI: THESE THINGS ARE GOING IN TWO TERRIBLE DIRECTIONS. OH, GOD, THIS IS TERRIBLE. DAVE CARRARO: BOTH THESE FISH ARE ON FRAGILE LINES AND IF THESE LINES MAKE CONTACT WE COULD POSSIBLY LOSE BOTH FISH. SANDRO MANIACI: HOW ABOUT YOU, ONE US AS HAS TO STAY TIGHT. (BLEEP) SPOT HERE MAN, (BLEEP) SPOT. I'M GOING UP HIGH. DAVE CARRARO: I'M DOWN DEEP. I THINK I FEEL YOU. YUP, I FEEL YOU. COME BACK OFF, YOU STAY TIGHT. THE DANGER RIGHT NOW IS IF THESE TWO LINES CROSSED UNDERNEATH THE WATER, THESE FISH COULD BREAK FREE. SO WHAT WE GOTTA DO IS MOVE THE FISH I'M FIGHTING UP TO THE BOW AND AS FAR AWAY FROM SANDRO'S FISH AS POSSIBLE. I'M GONNA COME UNDERNEATH YOU SANDRO. MOVING THE ROD FROM THE BACK TO THE FRONT, A VERY RISKY MOVE BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE. GEORDIE, HAND ME THAT ROD. GEORDIE SOUSA: IT'S STILL PRETTY HEAVY, IT'S STILL HEAVY. DAVE CARRARO: I GOT IT, I'M MUSCLE, I WORK OUT. REMEMBER TALK LOUD, OKAY? SANDRO MANIACI: IT'S WRAPPING! DAVE CARRARO: I MIGHT HAVE A WEAK LINE HERE. SANDRO MANIACI: NO, GO FORWARD STRAIGHT, FORWARD STRAIGHT. GEORDIE SOUSA: FORWARD STRAIGHT? DAVE CARRARO: DOUBLE-HEADER'S GREAT BUT IT'S NOT. DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO! A LOT OF COMMUNICATIONS NOT A 50/50% CHANCE IS IF WE GOT IT RIGHT OR WRONG. MY LINE MIGHT BE WEAK REMEMBER LINE CUTS LINE. SANDRO MANIACI: I'M DIGGING FAST RIGHT HERE I FEEL IT PUMPING. GEORDIE SOUSA: FORWARD AGAIN? SANDRO MANIACI: NO NEUTRAL, NEUTRAL... BIG (BLEEP) DUDE! GEORDIE SOUSA: SWIVEL. DAVE CARRARO: YEP, DO WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO. SANDRO MANIACI: YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL HE COMES AROUND AND WAIT FOR THE EASIER SHOT. GEORDIE SOUSA: ONE MORE LAP, DUDE. SANDRO MANIACI: NEED THE DART. GEORDIE SOUSA: DART'S BEHIND YOU. GEORDIE SOUSA: HIT HIM! GEORDIE SOUSA: SWIVEL. DAVE CARRARO: YEP, DO WHATEVER YOU GOT TO DO. SANDRO MANIACI: YOU WANT TO WAIT UNTIL HE COMES AROUND AND WAIT FOR THE EASIER SHOT. DAVE CARRARO: HOW DEEP IS THE FISH? GEORDIE SOUSA: ONE MORE LAP, DUDE. WE GOT A DOUBLE-HEADER ON. WE GOT DAVE UP ON THE BOW WITH ONE. GEORDIE SOUSA: SANCHO AND I ARE BACK HERE WORKING ONE. DART'S BEHIND YOU. GOT HIM, GOT HIM! DAVE CARRARO: LET ME KNOW WHEN WE GOT A TAIL ROPE ON HIM, ALL RIGHT? YOU GUYS GOT TO BACK UP WHEN YOU CAN. GO REVERSE. GEORDIE SOUSA: WE GOT HIM, DAVE. DAVE CARRARO: HURRY UP, HE'S COMING AROUND, GO REVERSE. GEORDIE SOUSA: GAFF BACK ON THIS SIDE WITH DAVE'S ROD. SANDRO MANIACI: YEAH, JUST TAKE CARE. GEORDIE SOUSA: GAFFE'S UP. SANDRO MANIACI: WE DEFINITELY GOT THIS. DAVE CARRARO: KEEP GOING FASTER, GO, GO. YOU CAN OPEN UP THAT LOWER WINDOW IN THE HATCH, YOU'RE GONNA DRIVE FROM HERE. GET THE DOOR OPEN WHEN YOU CAN. I HAVE COLOR IN THE DISTANCE. HE'S UP, HE WAS UP TOP. GEORDIE SOUSA: I DON'T THINK HE HAS COLOR. DAVE CARRARO: NICE JOB, GEORDIE. THERE HE IS, COLOR. SANDRO MANIACI: THIS ONE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIGGER HERE. DAVE CARRARO: BIG CLOCKWISE PINWHEEL! GOOD COLOR GEORDIE. SWIVELS IN THE WATER. GEORDIE SOUSA: I GOT HIM HERE. I SEE HIM HERE TOO. THAT ONE'S BIGGER. DAVE CARRARO: ALL RIGHT GEORDIE COME ON UP. GET THE GAFF. SANDRO MANIACI: I DON'T THINK I'LL BE ABLE TO REACH, BUD. DAVE CARRARO: GOT HIM, PULL! GEORDIE SOUSA: WE GOT HIM! DAVE CARRARO: WE'RE NOT DONE YET, UNREEL. GEORDIE SOUSA: THE STERN, JUST BURY THE GAFFE. BURY THAT GAFF IN HIS MOUTH. SANDRO MANIACI: YOU GOT IT? GEORDIE SOUSA: I GOT THIS [INAUDIBLE]. DAVE CARRARO: WE GOT HIM, TWO! KEEP IT COMING, GOOD. GEORDIE SOUSA: WOW! SANDRO MANIACI: NICE FISH, DUDE. DAVE CARRARO: WOW! SANDRO MANIACI: VERY NICE FISH, MAN! DAVE CARRARO: CHA-CHING, LOOK HOW FAT, LOOK HOW ROUND THAT IS! SANDRO MANIACI: YEAH, THAT'S A NICE PIECE OF TUNA, 94! DAVE CARRARO: 94, NICE! SANDRO MANIACI: KEEP IT COMING, KEEP IT COMING GOOD. DAVE CARRARO: WOW, JUST AS NICE. GEORDIE SOUSA: 89 INCHES! SANDRO MANIACI: YEAH, 89 INCHES! DAVE CARRARO: WEATHER'S COMING BUT WE GOT AT LEAST 700 POUNDS OF MEAT ON THE DECK. IF WE GET A GOOD PRICE FOR THESE FISH, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NEW LEADER IN THE FLEET. NOTHING BETTER THAN GETTING A FISH IN THE HOLE BEFORE THE WEATHER COMES. WE JUST GOT A DOUBLE AND WE GOT THEM BOTH. [MARCIANO GRUNTS]. DAVE MARCIANO: GOOD FOR DAVE, HE'S GOT A COUPLE FISH. BUT NOW THE GAME'S ON. IT'S GETTING A LITTLE ROUGH OUT NOW. YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE SKIES AND FEEL IN THE CHANGE IN THE WAVES. JOE MARCIANO: YOU JUST SEE THIS STORM COMING ALONG THE HORIZON LOOKS LIKE A LIGHTNING STRIKE SQUALL. DAVE MARCIANO: BOTTOM LINE, I HAVE TO CATCH FISH TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY. AND SOMETIMES THAT INVOLVES TAKING A FEW RISKS. YOU GUYS DON'T NEED TO WORRY. LIGHTNING'S ONLY DANGEROUS IF YOU'RE ON A BOAT. JOE MARCIANO: THAT'S NOT GOOD. DAVE CARRARO: HERE COMES THE WIND SHIFT. WEATHER CHANGE; BIG STORM COMING. AS A FISHERMAN CAPTAIN AND BOAT OWNER, YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WEATHER AT ALL TIMES. WITH HIGH WINDS, COMES HIGH SEAS. BUT, THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS LIGHTNING, WHEN YOU GOT THAT BIG POLE UP THERE, GREAT CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY. IF IT HITS THAT, IT'LL GO THROUGH THE BOAT AND WE'D LOSE OUR ELECTRONICS. WHEN IT COMES, THAT LIGHTENING BOLT'S COMING, YOU KNOW IT'S COMING. I MEAN THE HAIR ON YOUR HEAD STARTS TO STAND UP. WHEN THAT LIGHTNING BOLT HITS, IT MAKES YOU JUMP, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT'S PRETTY SCARY. TJ OTT: HANG ON GUYS, HANG ON. HOLY! WE JUST GOT THROUGH A SEVERE LIGHTNING STORM RIGHT NOW AND WE'VE DEFINITELY GOT TO PAY ATTENTION. AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE, TRYING TO AVOID TOUCHING THE STEERING WHEEL AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. IT'S SCARY MAN. ANYTIME YOU GET STUCK IN THESE SITUATIONS. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: I DON'T THINK I'VE BEEN IN LIKE A LIGHTNING STORM LIKE THIS WITH YOU BEFORE. TJ OTT: THE PROBLEM IS, EVERYTHING ON THESE BOAT IS ELECTRONIC, ALL THE MACHINERIES HERE BETWEEN THE RADARS THE FISH FINDER, THE PLOTTERS. INCLUDING OUR ENGINE AND OUR CONTROLS FOR EVERYTHING. SO, YOU KNOW, WORST CASE SCENARIO IF WE GOT HIT, YEAH, WE HAVE TO PRAY THAT WE DIDN'T KIND OF GO ON FIRE. BUT ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE TO PRAY WE DON'T LOSE, OH, MY GOODNESS. WE'VE GOT TO KIND OF PRAY THAT WE DON'T LOSE OUR ENGINE AND OUR GENERATOR. YOU KNOW, THE OLD SAYING IS, YOU KNOW, LIGHTNING STRIKES THE HIGHEST MOVING OBJECT THAT'S IN THAT AREA AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE DEFINITELY THE HIGHEST MOVING OBJECT SO, I'M NOT GONNA STAY OUT HERE AND RISK CATCHING FIRE, MAN. WE'RE HEADED IN. DAVE CARRARO: OH, GET INSIDE. SANDRO MANIACI: WOW! DAVE CARRARO: THAT WAS A QUARTER MILE AWAY RIGHT THERE. WHOO, WOW, IT'S GETTING BAD. SANDRO MANIACI: WOW, IT IS ABSOLUTELY POURING RIGHT NOW. DAVE CARRARO: WOULDN'T WANT TO BE OUT HERE IN A SMALL BOAT, I DON'T WANT TO BE OUT HERE IN A BIG BOAT. [LIGHTENING SNAP] WE'RE GONNA WHACKED HERE. WE'RE A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR A LIGHTNING STRIKE RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING DOWN. EVERYBODY GET DOWN LOW. TOLD YOU! YOU BETTER GET DOWN HERE. STAY DOWN HERE. SANDRO MANIACI: THAT LIGHTNING IS CLOSE. PLEASE GOD, DON'T LET US GET STRUCK RIGHT NOW. GEORDIE SOUSA: WHOA, THIS IS CRAZY! DAVE CARRARO: NO WATER'S COMING IN THAT WINDOW RIGHT? GEORDIE SOUSA: OH, NO, I'LL GO SLIDE IT SHUT. WHOA, OH GOD, THAT WAS TOO CLOSE! DAVE CARRARO: HURRY UP GET BACK. GET IN THE HOLE. GEORDIE SOUSA: OH MAN! DAVE CARRARO: LIGHTNING ALL OVER US HERE. ALL OVER US. PAUL HEBERT: THIS IS WHEN YOU THINK OF YOUR FAMILIES. I THINK OF MY DAUGHTER YOU KNOW AND IF SHE MISSES ME. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? BRAD KRASOWSKI: RIGHT. PAUL HEBERT: STUFF LIKE THAT. BRAD KRASOWSKI: AND THAT'S WHAT GET YOU. WE CAN SAY SCREW IT AND LEAVE RIGHT NOW. BUT THEN WE ALSO KNOW THAT HOW MANY TIMES WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE AT 4:00 AND THEN BY DARK HAVE THREE. PAUL HEBERT: YEAH, THAT'S WHY WE STICK IT OUT. PETE SPEECHES: CAN YOU, UH, GIVE ME HAND CHECK ON THEM? I WANNA LAY DOWN FOR A MINUTE, I GOT SUCH A SPLITTIN' HEADACHE. I'M STILL SICK OVER WHAT HAPPENED. THE WEATHER'S PRETTY NASTY. BUT I KNOW SOME GUYS ARE HEADED IN. WE JUST CAN'T GO IN RIGHT NOW. WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE WEEK. IT'S GONNA REALLY STING IF WE DON'T GET A BITE BEFORE THE END OF THIS TRIP. I'M GONNA LAY DOWN FOR A FEW MINUTES. IT'D BE SLACK TIED AT 5:30. SO, GET ME UP THEN. ERIN SPEECHES: YUP. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: PRETTY MUCH IT'S ROUGH OUT HERE IT'S BLOWING 30, 35 KNOTS. WE DESERVE THE PUNISHMENT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T BEEN PUTTING THEM ACROSS THE DOCK. SO WE DESERVE TO BE TIED TO IT. YOU KNOW WE'RE GETTING SMOKED BY ALL THE FLEET EVERYONE'S KIND OF LAUGHING AT US SAYING WE'RE A BUNCH OF JOKERS. WE GOT TO GET OUR CONFIDENCE BACK, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FINISH OUT THE SEASON STRONG. WE ONLY GOT FIVE WEEKS LEFT. WE GOT TO FISH HARD, MAN. [BEEPING]. ERIN SPEECHES: OH, IT'S JUST A MARK. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: THERE HE IS RIGHT THERE, 10 FATHOMS, BARRELING OUT. UGH, SEXY, SEXY. ERIN SPEECHES: COME ON, TAKE IT, WE NEED THIS. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: OH THERE HE IS, COME ON EAT! THEY DON'T EAT, DUDE. [REEL UNSPOOLING RAPIDLY]. ERIN SPEECHES: WE'RE ON! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON. YEAH BABY, WHOO-HOO, ALL RIGHT! ROUGH WEATHER FISHING BABY. [REEL UNSPOOLING RAPIDLY]. ERIN SPEECHES: WE'RE ON. PETE SPEECHES: YUP. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! YEAH BABY, WHOO-HOO, ALL RIGHT, AH! THE TIDE'S ACTUALLY ON OUR SIDE RIGHT NOW BOYS WE GOT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. THIS IS ONLY GONNA GET ROUGHER. GO TO THE ANGLED ROD HOLDER! TRAVIS BROWN: IT'S REALLY TOUGH WHEN IT'S ROUGH LIKE THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE YOU CAN'T GAIN ANY LINE BECAUSE WHEN THE BOAT COMES UP ON THE SWELL, IT JUST TAKES ALL THE LINE RIGHT BACK OFF BUT AS YOU COME DOWN IN THE SWELL YOU CAN GAIN. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: ROUGHEST DAY OF THE SEASON RIGHT HERE BOYS. THIS IS WHY WE DO IT RIGHT HERE. DAYS LIKE TODAY WHEN IT'S ROUGH AND EVERYTHING IS MISERABLE AND NO ONE WANTS TO BE HERE, THIS IS WHY YOU DO IT. DOWN ROD! SO STOKED WE NEED THIS FISH SO BAD. THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO, THERE YOU GO. KEEP IT ON, KEEP IT ON. HOLD ON BOYS, BIG WAVE. HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON. THAT WAS A NICE 7-FOOTER! TRAVIS BROWN: COME ON BACK, COME BACK. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: THE MOOD ON THE BOAT IS TENSE. I GOT GOOSE BUMPS. WE REALLY NEED IT. NOT JUST TO SAVE FACE BUT JUST TO KICK THE OTHER CAPTAINS IN THE TEETH. TJ'S TIED UP IN SOME DOCK, EATING LASAGNA. EVERYONE THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE TOO ROUGH AND THE PINWHEEL'S DOWN AND TIGHT. I TOLD YOU BOYS STAY WITH ME. EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY. THE GAFF RIGHT HERE, OH NO! TRAVIS BROWN: BACK HIM OFF, BACK HIM OFF! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: ALL RIGHT, EASY MEGA HEAT. TRAVIS BROWN: THERE YOU GO, GET READY. GET SOME, GET SOME, GET SOME, GET SOME, GET SOME. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: GET SOME, GET SOME, GET SOME. YOU'RE GONNA GET ALL THE WAY TO SWIVEL. WE COULD LOSE THIS FISH AT ANY TIME THOUGH MAN. THIS THING IS LIKE 40 FEET AWAY, HE'S REAL ERRATIC AT THE BOAT HE'S DEFINITELY BEEN HOOKED BEFORE. I'M LIKE, NERVOUS. DRAKE ROY: LET ALONE WHEN YOU NEED ONE AS BAD AS WE DO RIGHT NOW. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: THESE ARE THE MOMENTS THAT MAKE THE DIFFERENCE RIGHT HERE IS WHETHER WE'RE GONNA CATCH THIS FISH. LAST 40 FEET, A LOT OF PRESSURE ON THE FISH HE'S FIGHTING AND GETTING A BIGGER AND BIGGER HOLE IN HIS MOUTH. WE DON'T WANT TO PULL HOOKS. WE'VE ALREADY PULLED ENOUGH OF THEM THIS YEAR. AH, THIS ONE'S GONNA BURY THE COCKPIT. WHOO, 50 FEET AWAY! HE'S A BUTTERBALL, WE JUST HIT A GRAND SLAM! AH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! I TOLD WE WERE GONNA GET A BITE TODAY. I JUST... OH MY GOD... OH, PULLED HOOK! TRAVIS BROWN: HOW MANY MORE TIMES ARE WE GONNA DO THAT? OH MY GOD! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT TUNA FISH SAID TO US? TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: "SEE YOU LATER, BYE." TRAVIS BROWN: "THANKS FOR PLAYING." TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WOW! TRAVIS BROWN: THIS SUCKS. ERIN SPEECHES: WE'VE BEEN ON THIS FISH FOR OVER 2 HOURS, STARTED AT DINNERTIME AND NOW IT IS RAINING. PETE SPEECHES: STRAIGHT AHEAD BUMP. A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT. A LITTLE BIT LEFT. I DON'T CARE WHETHER IT'S RAINING, I'M WET, I'M COLD. IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO GET THIS FISH IN THE BOAT THAT I DON'T WANNA LEAVE THE ROD. I DON'T WANT TO MAKE ANY MISTAKES. I JUST WANT THE FISH. PUT IT IN GEAR, PUT IT IN FORWARD. ERIN'S STAYING FOCUSED. IT IS HARD IN THE WEATHER AND SHE'S GIVING IT HER ALL. QUICK BUMP HARD RIGHT. IT MAKES ME FEEL REALLY GOOD THAT SHE WANTS THIS FISH AS BAD AS I DO. SHE DOESN'T WANNA FAIL. NEUTRAL!
