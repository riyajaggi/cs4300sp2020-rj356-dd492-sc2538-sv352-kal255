 DAVE CARRARO: THIS IS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE! NARRATOR: CATCHING... TJ OTT: WE GOT HIM! JOE MARCIANO: YEAH! PETE SPEECHES: SCORE! NARRATOR: WICKED TUNA. AT THE START OF WEEK FIVE, HOT TUNA LEADS THE FLEET. AND HARD MERCHANDISE ARE BOTH WITHIN STRIKING DISTANCE OF THE TOP SPOT. ♪ ♪ JOE MARCIANO: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! YEAH, YEAH, HE'S ON, YEAH! DAVE MARCIANO: THAT A BOY JOE, KEEP REELING! KEEP REELING, YOU'RE DOING GOOD! JOE MARCIANO: DOWN AND DIRTY. DAVE MARCIANO: THAT'S HOW WE LIKE IT. IT'S WEEK FIVE, AND THE HARD MERCHANDISE IS STARTING OFF WITH A BANG. JOE MARCIANO: SO, WE GOT SOMETHING ON HERE. DAVE MARCIANO: YEAH, THAT'S A FISH JOE, FOR SURE. JOE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT. DAVE MARCIANO: WHERE'S THE BASKET, YOU GOT YOUR BASKET CLEAR? JOE MARCIANO: OH, YEAH. DAVE MARCIANO: WE'RE IN THIRD PLACE, BEHIND HOT TUNA AND DOT COM, BUT ONE GOOD FISH COULD GET US BACK ON TOP. KEEP IT THERE, HAVE A TAIL STRAP READY, JOE. THAT'S RIGHT, JOE, JUST MAKE SURE YOU TIGHTEN IT UP HERE. JOE MARCIANO: YEAH, HEY! DAVE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT, IT'S UNDERWAY, YEAH. JOE MARCIANO: YEAH? DAVE MARCIANO: HE'S STARTING TO DO THE HEAD SHAKES THERE. JOE MARCIANO: DEFINITELY, LIKE, DECENT SIZE. DAVE MARCIANO: READY, JOE? JOE MARCIANO: YUP! DAVE MARCIANO: THERE YOU GO, GET ON HIM! JOE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT, I'M ON HIM! DAVE MARCIANO: THIS WEEK, IT'S JUST MYSELF, AND MY SON, JOE. BUT WE MAKE A GREAT TEAM. I KNOW WE CAN GET THIS DONE. JOE MARCIANO: HE'S MAKING A RUN NOW. DAVE MARCIANO: SHOW HIM WHO'S BOSS! JOE MARCIANO: YEAH! DAVE MARCIANO: YEAH, MULE! DAVE CARRARO: MARCIANO'S GOT HIM ON. YEAH, THEY'RE STILL PULLING AWAY. ROD'S BENT OVER. SO FAR THIS SEASON THE DOT COM HAS CAUGHT MORE FISH THAN ANYONE. BUT THE QUALITY OF OUR FISH, THEY'VE BEEN LOW, SO ONLY IN SECOND PLACE. I DON'T LIKE THAT. MARCIANO WAS THE TOP BOAT LAST SEASON WHICH MEANS THE TARGET'S ON HIS BACK AND WE'RE GOING AFTER HIM. COMING OUT HERE FOR ONE FISH NOW ISN'T GONNA CUT THE CAKE. SANDRO MANIACI: WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET 'EM. JOE MARCIANO: AMPED UP AND READY TO LAND THIS BIG BOY. LET'S GO. COME TO PAPA. DAVE MARCIANO: THERE YOU GO, JOE. YOU'RE DOING GOOD, YOU GOT HIM. IT'S GONNA BE CLOSE HERE, BUT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET THAT HARPOON IN HIM. JOE MARCIANO: THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL PART OF THE FIGHT, WE GOTTA PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. DAVE MARCIANO: THERE HE IS, DOWN DEEP. JOE MARCIANO: THAT'S RIGHT. DAVE MARCIANO: KEEP REELING! HE'S GONNA COME UP NEAR THE TOP NOW! GET READY, JOE! JOE MARCIANO: YUP! DAVE MARCIANO: NOW, LET HIM JUST GO UNDER ONCE MORE AND THEN, WE'RE GONNA PULL HIM UP. GOT HIM, GET THE GAFF READY, JOE! JUST BACK OFF ON THE DRAG A LITTLE! THERE YOU GO, JOE. JOE MARCIANO: THERE WE GO, I THINK WE GOT HIM. DAVE MARCIANO: THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT, WE GOT HIM, ALL RIGHT, WE GOT HIM! JOE MARCIANO: HEY, YEAH, LET'S GO! DAVE MARCIANO: YEAH! JOE MARCIANO: TAILS UP! DAVE MARCIANO: THE RAT RACE IS OVER FOR HIM AND THE RATS WON. JOE MARCIANO: NICE ONE, NICE BUTTERBALL. DAVE MARCIANO: LAST SEASON, WE WERE THE TOP BOAT. BUT DOWN IN THE OUTER BANKS, WE LOST A LOT OF MONEY. I HAVE TO PROVE WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED IN GLOUCESTER, WASN'T A FLUKE, AND WE CAN DO IT AGAIN. ALL RIGHT, DOWN ON THE DECK, JUST ON HIS NOSE, JUST LET HIM STAND UP THERE. THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT TO THE DECK. THAT'S IT, 74 INCHES ON THE MONEY. NOT A MONSTER, BUT A KEEPER. DAVE CARRARO: HEY, COME IN, DAVE. DAVE MARCIANO: YEAH, IS THAT YOU, DAVE? DAVE CARRARO: YEAH, YOU GOT HIM? DAVE MARCIANO: YEAH, WE GOT HIM, IT'S A FISH, WE'LL TAKE HIM. ONE FOR ME AND MY SON. DAVE CARRARO: SOUNDS GOOD. ALL RIGHT, CONGRATS, GOOD JOB. DAVE MARCIANO: THANKS FOR THAT. WE'LL CAMP OUT, SEE IF WE CAN GET ANOTHER ONE. DAVE CARRARO: YEAH, WE'RE GONNA STAY ON THE SPOT, TOO. RIGHT OUTTA THE GATE, MARCIANO'S GOT A FISH. I WAS HOPING FOR THAT KIND OF SUCCESS ON OUR BOAT, BUT AT LEAST I KNOW THERE'S FISH HERE. NOW, I JUST GOTTA HOPE THAT WE CAN LAND THE NEXT ONE. DAVE MARCIANO: VERY GOOD, STANDING BY. STARTING OFF THE WEEK, WITH ONE FISH IS PERFECT. AND IF DAVE ON THE DOT COM WANTS TO KEEP WATCHING, THAT'S OKAY WITH ME, TOO. REMEMBER DAVE, LESSONS USUALLY COST EXTRA. JOE MARCIANO: LET'S GO! PAUL HERBERT: LET'S GO FISHING. IT'S WEEK FIVE AND WE'VE CAUGHT THREE FISH SO FAR. BUT LAST TRIP THINGS GOT A LITTLE ROCKY WITH MY MATES, BRAD AND LANCE. I'M OVER IT, LANCE! LANCE SISTARE: I ASK YOU ONE SIMPLE THING, AND YOU FLIP THE [BLEEP] OUT. PAUL HERBERT: THIS IS MY BOAT, I'M THE CAPTAIN, I'M THE BOSS, AND THAT'S THAT. BRAD KRASOWSKI: I DON'T KNOW, MAN, THAT'S JUST BAD. PAUL HERBERT: IN THE MEANTIME, I TOOK CARE OF BRAD AND LANCE AND GOT THEM PAID. NOW, I'M JUST HOPING TO MOVE ON AND GET BACK TO FISHING. WHERE THE HELL IS EVERYBODY? GUYS, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE. I'M GONNA CALL BRAD AND SEE WHERE HE'S AT. AUTOMATED VOICE: YOUR CALL HAS BEEN FORWARDED TO AN AUTOMATIC VOICE MESSAGE SYSTEM. PAUL HERBERT: AND HE WON'T ANSWER HIS CALL. WELL, LET'S SEE IF LANCE WILL ANSWER. LANCE SISTARE: YEAH? PAUL HERBERT: HEY, WHERE ARE YOU?! I JUST GOT DOWN THE BOAT. WE'RE READY TO GO AT FIVE! LANCE SISTARE: CAN YOU HEAR ME? I QUIT. PAUL HERBERT: HEY, THAT'S [BLEEP] YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME. YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE A MAN. LANCE SISTARE: A MAN? YOU GO WAY OUT OF YOUR WAY TO BEAT MY ASS, EVERY DAY. EVERY-SINGLE-DAY. PAUL HERBERT: WHAT DO YOU PUT UP WITH WORKING ON A BOAT? LANCE SISTARE: ON TOP OF THAT, YOU GONNA BACK DOWN FIVE MILES ON A FISH? WHAT KIND OF FISHING IS THAT, DUDE? [PAUL SCOFFS] WHY DO YOU THINK BRAD LEFT? IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF THE MONEY. IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A MORON. PAUL HERBERT: HOW MAY TUNAS HAVE YOU CAUGHT, LANCE? LANCE SISTARE: CALL BRAD. PAUL HERBERT: HOW MANY TUNAS HAVE YOU CAUGHT IN YOUR [BLEEP] LIFETIME? LANCE SISTARE: CALL, CALL BRAD. PAUL HERBERT: YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE, YOU'RE A [BLEEP] GOOGAN, THAT'S ALL YOU ARE, DUDE. YOU'RE TALKING LIKE THAT, YOU'RE A GOOGAN. LANCE SISTARE: NOPE, TAKE CARE. PAUL HERBERT: OH, HE JUST HUNG UP. HE JUST HUNG UP. I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN MY LIFE, EVER. IN ALL THE YEARS OF FISHING, EVER. THE ONLY TUNAS HE EVER CAUGHT WAS WITH ME. IN HIS WHOLE LIFE. YOU JUST DON'T LEAVE YOUR CAPTAIN HIGH AND DRY. YOU JUST DON'T DO THAT. BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET THIS SLOW ME DOWN. I'M GONNA GO LONE WOLF, BABY! LET'S GO CATCH SOME TUNA! I'M GONNA CATCH FISH. YOU WATCH. DRAKE ROY: WE HAVE TO CATCH A FISH FOR HASH BROWNS AND BACON. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO EAT UNTIL WE CATCH SOMETHING. RIGHT NOW, THE PINWHEEL'S IN FOURTH PLACE AND THAT'S NOT WHERE I WANNA BE I FISH HARDER THAN EVERYONE ELSE IN THE FLEET AND I WANNA BE NUMBER ONE. BEAUTIFUL FLAT CALM, GREAT DAY TO CATCH A TUNA. I ENJOY BEING ON THE WATER MORE THAN I LIKE BEING ON LAND. SO I'M GONNA GRIND EACH AND EVERY DAY, AND THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT IN A MATE, BECAUSE OTHERWISE, THEY'RE NOT GONNA LIKE THEIR LIFE TOO MUCH. DRAKE ROY: I HAVEN'T TALKED TO MY GIRLFRIEND IN, LIKE, TWO DAYS, BUT, I'D LOVE TO SEE HER SOON, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN, LIKE, TWO WEEKS. IT'S ROUGH HAVING A JOB LIKE THIS AND A GIRLFRIEND. I'VE NEVER FISHED WITH ANYBODY LIKE TYLER. HE ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO COME IN EMPTY HANDED AND WE'LL STAY OUT THERE AS LONG AS IT TAKES. IT DOES WEAR ON YOU, NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY, BUT MENTALLY. YOUR MIND STARTS TO GO. YOU LOSE ALL INTERACTION WITH LAND, THE ONLY PEOPLE YOU'RE TALKING TO IS THE CAPTAIN, YOU KNOW? TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: HAVING A LOT OF WHALES AND STUFF, PORPOISES PUSHING THROUGH, WE'RE ON THE SEA LIFE, SO WE'RE DEFINITELY IN A FREAKING GOOD ZONE. IT'S GOOD ACTION HERE, I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOME TUNAS DON'T SHOW UP SOON. ALL THIS BAIT, AND ALL THESE OTHER CREATURES FEEDING AROUND HERE, THE TUNAS HAVE GOTTA BE AROUND HERE, TOO. I WONDER WHERE THE HOT TUNA IS TODAY? PROBABLY AT THE DOCK. BUNCH OF SALLIES. TJ OTT: HI, HOW YOU DOING? RECEPTIONIST: GOOD, HOW ARE YOU? NEW PUPPY? TJ OTT: YEAH. RECEPTIONIST: RIPPLE OR? TJ OTT: RIPPLE. REBA'S JUST HERE FOR MORAL SUPPORT. WE'VE GOTTA TAKE RIPPLE IN FOR HER SIX MONTH VET VISIT. WE NEVER WANNA MISS A GOOD DAY OF FISHING BUT SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE, OR IN THIS CASE, ANIMALS THAT TAKE CARE OF US. SHE'S LIKE MY KID MAN, I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF HER, YOU KNOW? FORTUNATELY, WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE BOAT IN THE FLEET RIGHT NOW, SO WE CAN AFFORD TO TAKE OUR TIME TO GET BACK OUT THERE THIS WEEK. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: GOOD GIRL, REBA, GOOD GIRL. MIKE OTT: BEING ON THE HOT TUNA, YOU DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE YOU'RE RUNNING A DOGGY DAY CARE. ALL IN ALL, IT'S PRETTY MUCH A BIG DOGHOUSE. VETERINARIAN: AND, THAT'S IT. YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE. TJ OTT: WOW, GOOD GIRL. SOME OF THE OTHER CAPTAINS IN THE FLEET DON'T SEE THE BENEFITS OF TAKING A LITTLE EXTRA TIME TO TAKE CARE OF YOUR CREW. SHE DID GREAT, MAN. I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD SHE DID. SHE DIDN'T EVEN FLINCH. I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE ON THE BOAT, THE DOGS INCLUDED, ARE STRONG AND HEALTHY BEFORE WE HEAD OFF SHORE. GUYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH. HAVE A GREAT DAY. RECEPTIONIST: THANK YOU, BYE! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON. TJ OTT: OKAY, TAKE CARE. COME ON, GUYS. NOW WE CAN GO FISHING. DAVE CARRARO: THERE HE IS. SANDRO MANIACI: HO, HO. OH, MY GOD. GEORDIE SOUSA: HO, HO. DAVE CARRARO: WE'RE STILL OUT HERE FISHING, RIGHT NEXT TO THE HARD MERCH. THEY PULLED ONE IN EARLIER, AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO FALL ANY FURTHER BEHIND. IF WE'RE MARKING FISH, THEY'RE MARKING FISH. GOTTA MAKE THIS TUNA ONE FOR THE DOT COM. IT'S COMING UP ON IT DOWN, COMING UP ON IT DOWN, RIGHT NOW! HARD. DAVE MARCIANO: THERE'S A FISH! JOE MARCIANO: YEAH, COME ON! DAVE MARCIANO: DEFINITE FISH, LOOKS LIKE A GOOD ONE! WE ALREADY GOT ONE FISH ON THE BOAT TODAY, BUT TWO FISH, WOULD BE TWICE AS GOOD! AND DOT COM IS STILL FISHING NEAR US, TOO. SO I WOULDN'T MIND GETTING ANOTHER ONE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. COME ON, BITE ME! DAVE CARRARO: DUDE, WHOA! GEORDIE SOUSA: THAT IS A JUMBO. SANDRO MANIACI: THAT IS A WORLD RECORD RIGHT THERE, MAN. GEORDIE SOUSA: 140 RIGHT INTO THE MUD. SANDRO MANIACI: WOW, THAT'S A BIG BOY. [BEEPING] DAVE MARCIANO: IT'S ANYBODY'S GAME HERE. [REEL UNSPOOLS RAPIDLY] JOE MARCIANO: HEY, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! DAVE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ON. WE THERE? JOE MARCIANO: THERE HE GOES, THERE HE GOES, HE'S RUNNING. NOW, HE'S SCREAMING, HE'S TAKING LINE. HOPEFULLY, IT'LL TURN OUT WE CAN LAND THIS ONE. DAVE MARCIANO: YEAH. ALL RIGHT, JOE, LET'S MOVE THE ROD. SECOND HOOKUP ON OUR FIRST DAY OF THE WEEK. THINGS JUST KEEP ON ROLLING FOR THE HARD MERCH. WE'VE MADE A GOOD STARTING RUN, BUT WE'RE A LONG WAY FROM LANDING HIM. WE STILL GOTTA GET HIM IN THE BOAT. JOE MARCIANO: WELL, IT'S ACTING LIKE A 300, 400 POUND FISH. THAT CAN MEAN UP TO FIVE, SIX GRAND. THAT'S A GREAT DAY. PLUS WE HAVE THAT LITTLE ONE ON DECK THAT'LL JUST ADD ICING ON THE CAKE. DAVE MARCIANO: LET'S HOPE EVERYTHING WORKS OUT RIGHT FOR US. JOE MARCIANO: OH, SEE COLOR. I SEE HIM DOWN THERE. DAVE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT, JOE, GET READY TO GET ON THE ROD. JOE MARCIANO: YEP, YEP. DAVE MARCIANO: THERE YOU GO, GET ON IT. THERE YOU GO. THAT A BOY. REEL, REEL, REEL, REEL, REEL. DOING GOOD, JOE. YOU'RE DOING GREAT. YEAH, THAT-A-BOY. PULL, PULL, PULL HIM INTO ME, PULL HIM INTO ME, PULL HIM INTO ME. AH, I MISSED HIM! WE'RE GONNA LOSE HIM! LET HIM GO, LET HIM GO, LET HIM GO. PULL HIM UP, PULL HIM UP, PULL HIM UP, PULL HIM UP. I CAN'T BELIEVE I [BLEEP] IT UP LIKE THIS. WHAT A [BLEEP] IDIOT. TOTALLY [BLEEP] THAT UP. THESE TANGLED LINES ARE A DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. THE MAIN LINE COULD SNAP AT ANY SECOND AND IT'S GOODBYE, TUNA. HOPE WE GET ANOTHER SHOT. I TOTALLY CHOKED ON THAT. DAMMIT. JUST KEEP FIGHTING HIM, JOE, YOU'RE DOING GOOD. PULL, ONE MORE CIRCLE. JOE MARCIANO: COMING RIGHT THERE. DAVE MARCIANO: NAILED HIM. JOE MARCIANO: NICE SHOT, NICE SHOT. DAVE MARCIANO: AIN'T GOT HIM YET. GET THE HARPOON IN HIM. IS THAT TAIL STRAP READY, JOE? JOE MARCIANO: YEP. DAVE MARCIANO: THERE YOU GO, BUDDY. JOE MARCIANO: GOT HIM! DAVE MARCIANO: CLEAT HIM OFF, WE GOT HIM! JOE MARCIANO: YEAH! DAVE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT, YEAH! ALL RIGHT, JOE, NICE JOB, WELL DONE, YEAH, WE GOT HIM! JOE MARCIANO: WE'RE ON A ROLL THIS WEEK AND THAT'S JUST PROVING THAT THE HARD MERCH CAN GET IT DONE AGAIN. DAVE MARCIANO: NICE GOING, JOE. NICE GOING, YOU DID GOOD. SEVENTY-SIX. JOE MARCIANO: SEVENTY-SIX. DAVE MARCIANO: WE'LL TAKE HIM. JOE MARCIANO: YEP. DAVE MARCIANO: SO, WE GOT TWO NOW ON THIS TRIP WITH ME AND MY SON. WHAT WE GOTTA DO NOW IS GET BACK TO THE BALL, GET THE LINES OUT AND HOPE OUR LUCK STILL HOLDS. ERIN SPEECHES: UGH, I DON'T FEEL GOOD. I JUST DON'T FEEL GREAT. I'M JUST A LITTLE HUNG OVER. PETE SPEECHES: YOU WEREN'T DRINKING, WERE YOU? ERIN SPEECHES: I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. PETE SPEECHES: WE'RE IN THE FIFTH WEEK OF THE SEASON AND I ONLY HAVE TWO FISH. WE STARTED OUT THE SEASON HOT. WE GOT THE FIRST TUNA OF THE YEAR, BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY UP AND DOWN SINCE THEN. IF WE HAVE ANY HOPE TO COMPETE WITH THE REST OF THE FLEET, I HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RELY ON MY CREW AND NOT HAVE THEM SHOW UP TO THE BOAT IN NO CONDITION TO FISH. [ERIN GRUNTS]. BRANDON PIERCE: YOU KNOW, I THINK ERIN WENT OUT LAST NIGHT AND HAD A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH FUN, BUT THE FISH DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE HUNG OVER. THEY'RE NOT GONNA WAIT FOR YOU TO FEEL BETTER. ERIN SPEECHES: MM-HMM, MM-HMM. PETE SPEECHES: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? ERIN SPEECHES: I LIKE TO PARTY. PETE SPEECHES: HUH? ERIN SPEECHES: I SAID I WANTED TO PARTY. PETE SPEECHES: YEAH, YOU LIKE TO DO TOO MUCH OF THAT, I THINK. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN ERIN BECAUSE WE HAVE NO PLACE FOR NOT BEING AT OUR TOP WHEN WE'RE FISHING. IT'S A JOB. I TAKE THIS BUSINESS VERY SERIOUSLY. SHE KNOWS BETTER. YOU'RE BETTER THAN THAT. I EXPECT MORE FROM YOU. THIS IS NOT KIDS' GAME, THIS IS WORK. TOUGHEN UP! ERIN SPEECHES: UGH! MAN: YOU GOT ME, DOT COM? GEORDIE SOUSA: WHAT'S THAT? MAN: QUITE A STORY OVER ON THE WICKED PISSAH. GEORDIE SOUSA: WHAT HAPPENED? MAN: THEY QUIT. BRAD AND LANCE QUIT, THEY'RE GONE. DAVE CARRARO: WHAT HAPPENED? GEORDIE SOUSA: NO KIDDING. DAVE CARRARO: NO WAY. GEORDIE SOUSA: WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE. WE HAVEN'T HEARD, WE JUST SAW HIM. MAN: YEAH, THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP SO NOW PAULIE'S OUT FISHING BY HIMSELF. DAVE CARRARO: HE JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS? GEORDIE SOUSA: OH, THAT'S, WOW. SANDRO MANIACI: WOW. GEORDIE SOUSA: WOW, WELL THAT'S KIND OF A BUMMER. DAVE CARRARO: PAUL LOSING HIS MATES, THAT COULD BE A DEATH BLOW TO HIS SEASON. GEORDIE SOUSA: WELL STAY IN TOUCH, I'LL GIVE YOU A SHOUT LATER ON TONIGHT. MAN: ALRIGHT GEORDIE, TALK TO YOU LATER. DAVE CARRARO: HOW DID THAT COME UP? GEORDIE SOUSA: HE GOES, UH, "YOU HAVEN'T HEARD?" I SAID, "NO, WE'VE BEEN OUT HERE FISHING. WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN." DAVE CARRARO: I'M SURPRISED, I MEAN, I'M SURPRISED WE DIDN'T KNOW. AND THIS HAPPENED WHEN? THIS HAPPENED YESTERDAY. GEORDIE SOUSA: YEAH, I THINK HE SAID IT WAS YESTERDAY. DAVE CARRARO: PAUL'S DEMONSTRATED BEFORE THAT HE'S DIFFICULT TO WORK WITH. I'VE HAD PROBLEMS FISHING WITH PAUL IN THE PAST AND IT'S NO SURPRISE TO ME IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN. HE STILL HAS A LOT TO LEARN. WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. GEORDIE SOUSA: CATCHING ONE ALONE IS VERY DIFFICULT. AND YOU'VE GOT ONE MAN, TRYING TO DO THE JOB OF WHAT 2 OR 3 GUYS ON A BOAT WOULD DO SO IT'S A DIFFICULT THING TO DO, CATCH A FISH BY YOURSELF. DAVE CARRARO: WOW, I MEAN, I'M JUST SHOCKED AND AWE RIGHT NOW. [PAUL HUMMING] I WILL CATCH JUST AS MANY TUNA AS EVERY BOAT IN THIS OCEAN. EVERY BOAT IN THE [BLEEP] OCEAN I'LL CATCH JUST AS MANY. BY MYSELF. IT'S A LOT OF WORK, IT'S A LOT MORE TIME. YOU LOSE A LOT MORE FISH BEING ALONE 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO HOLD THE FISH, GET THE GAFF, GET THE TAIL ROPE, TRY TO CLEAR THE LINES. YOU GOT TO DO EVERYTHING ALONE, IS WHAT IT IS. IT'S GONNA BE HARDER BUT I DIDN'T SAY IT WAS GONNA BE IMPOSSIBLE. I THINK WE'RE MARKING TUNA NOW. THAT'S TUNA. THAT'S THREE OF 'EM. THEY'RE HERE. THEY'RE RIGHT AT THE LINES, TOO. THEY'RE RIGHT AT THOSE BAITS. [BEEPING] HERE WE GO! [REEL UNSPOOLS RAPIDLY] I'M ON! ♪ ♪ HOOKED UP RIGHT NOW. COME ON, BABY! HERE WE GO! I'M BACKING DOWN. GOTTA FIGHT HIM FROM HERE BY MYSELF. GONNA TRY TO GET SOME LINE BACK. [LINE UNSPOOLING] MY CONTROL LEVER LET GO. SOMETHING HAPPENED. IT'S A PROBLEM 'CAUSE I HAVE TO GO INSIDE TO DRIVE. IT'S GONNA BE HARD 'CAUSE I GOT NO FORWARD AND REVERSE. I'M FIGHTING THE FISH WITH NOTHING. BY MYSELF. PAUL HERBERT: MY CONTROL LEVER LET GO. SOMETHING HAPPENED. I'M FIGHTING THE FISH WITH NOTHING. BY MYSELF. IT'S A PROBLEM 'CAUSE I HAVE TO GO INSIDE TO DRIVE. MY SHIFTER CABLE CAME UNDONE. MY CONTROLS ARE NOT WORKING IN THE BACK SO I HAVE TO RUN UP THE FRONT OF THE BOAT. WISH I COULD FIX THIS. THAT WOULD BE NICE. IF I HAD A MATE RIGHT NOW, I'D BE FIGHTING THE FISH AND THE MATE WOULD BE DRIVING AND WE'D BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS NO PROBLEM. WHAT A JOKE. YEAH, I JUST LOST HIM. [BLEEP]. YEAH, YEAH, HE'S GONE. PULLED THE HOOK 'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE ANY CONTROLS. I COULDN'T, I COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE. I COULDN'T, I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING. I COULDN'T DRIVE. I COULDN'T, COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE! I CAN'T BE IN TWO PLACES AT ONCE WHILE THERE'S A TUNA AT THE END OF THE LINE. IF I HAD A MATE ON THE BOAT, THEY COULD DRIVE FROM UP FRONT. IN THIS MOMENT, I'M DEFINITELY MISSING MY MATES. BRAND NEW. BRAND NEW, YEAH, IT'S ALL DONE. ALLS I NEEDED WAS TIME, THAT'S IT. TIME, TIME, TIME. [BEEPING] TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WE JUST MARK ONE? [INAUDIBLE]. IT'S A NICE ONE, DUDE AT 20. YOU'VE GOTTA TELL ME THAT, BRO. DRAKE ROY: I'M SORRY. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WE DIDN'T GET A KEEPER LAST WEEK AND WE'RE EMPTY SO FAR THIS WEEK. IT'S NOT A GOOD START. I'M STARTING TO WONDER JUST HOW LONG WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ROCK BEFORE WE CATCH ANOTHER ONE. COME ON! DRAKE ROY: WE'VE BEEN SITTING HERE ALL NIGHT, JUST MARKED OUR FIRST FISH, WE'RE HERE AT JEFFERY'S LEDGE. TYLER'S STYLE OF FISHING IS JUST CRAZY WHAT HE'S DOING RIGHT NOW. THE WAY HE'S GRINDING. ALL HE CARES ABOUT IS TUNA AND HE WILL GRIND HIMSELF INTO THE GROUND WITHOUT ANY FOOD, NOTHING, UNTIL HE CATCHES A FISH. HE DOESN'T CARE. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: YOU PUT EVERYTHING ASIDE, EVERY, ALL YOUR WANTS AND DESIRES, EVERYTHING AND JUST GRIND WITH ONE GOAL, CATCH MORE TUNAS THAN ANYONE ELSE. YO, BRO! YOU GONNA COME GIVE ME A HAND OR WHAT? I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WITH DRAKE RIGHT NOW. WHEN WE'RE OUT HERE ON THE WATER, I EXPECT US TO BE WORKING HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE. COME ON, MAN. LET'S GET GOING. THAT'S HOW YOU GET BITES, IT'S HOW YOU CATCH FISH, AND RIGHT NOW, DRAKE ISN'T GIVING ME 100% AND I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THAT. [DRAKE COUGHING] DRAKE ROY: UH, I DON'T FEEL GOOD. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME. COME ON, MAN. WE GOT FISHING TO DO. MIKE OTT: GETTING SOME CORN READY. GRILL UP SOME CORN, MAYBE MAKE SOME PORK CHOPS. I JUST USUALLY PUT SALT, PEPPER, AND BUTTER IN THE PAN. PUT THEM STRAIGHT ON THE GRILL SO THEY BROWN A LITTLE BIT, PUT SOME PARMESAN CHEESE ON THEM. TJ OTT: A CREW THAT'S WELL FED IS DEFINITELY HAPPY AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT. I WANT A GOOD ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL ON THE WATER. MIKE OTT: I LOVE PEPPER. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF BOATS OUT HERE THAT DON'T HAVE THE BEST ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN THE MATES AND THE CAPTAINS. WE HAVE A GOOD BALANCE ON THE HOT TUNA, AND THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO BE SUCCESSFUL. OH, THERE'S A MARK! THERE'S SOME KIND OF MARK. RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM. IF ANYTHING, IT COULD BE TWO. MIKE OTT: ALL THE COMFORTS OF HOME. SIXTY MILES FROM GLOUCESTER. GOT THE PUPPIES HERE, THEY'RE HAPPY. [REEL UNSPOOLS RAPIDLY]. WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! JUST HOOKED UP! PULL THE BOAT FORWARD. GO FORWARD, GO FORWARD, GO, GO, GO, GO! TJ OTT: THAT WAY. SWING IT THE OTHER WAY! SWING IT, SWING IT, SWING IT! ERIN SPEECHES: I DON'T FEEL GOOD. THESE SWELLS ARE REALLY GETTING TO ME. PETE SPEECHES: ERIN'S STILL TRYING TO RECOVER FROM HER HANGOVER. I HOPE SHE GETS WELL FAST. PETE SPEECHES: IF WE HOOK UP, I'M GONNA NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK. MARKING, RIGHT DOWN ON THE BOTTOM! BRANDON PIERCE: GOOD SIGN. I THINK ERIN SHOWING UP HUNGOVER IS KIND OF UNPROFESSIONAL. IF SHE'S PART OF THE CREW, AND WE RELY ON HER TO DO HER SHARE OF THE WORK. NOW I HAVE TO PICK UP HER SLACK. WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! PETE SPEECHES: WE'RE ON? BRANDON PIERCE: ERIN AND SARAH ON AGAIN! PETE SPEECHES: ERIN, GET OUT HERE! BRANDON PIERCE: OH, THAT'S A FISH, THIS IS A FISH, THIS IS A TUNA. ERIN SPEECHES: UGH, I DON'T FEEL GOOD. PETE SPEECHES: PUT IT IN REVERSE, ERIN! STOP JUST STANDING THERE. PUT IT IN REVERSE, HURRY! ERIN SPEECHES: I'M REALLY, REALLY NAUSEOUS. PETE SPEECHES: JUST GET IN THE WHEELHOUSE AND STAY OUT OF THE WAY RIGHT NOW. KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING! TJ OTT: SWAP, JARRETT? JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. MIKE OTT: READY? JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: YEP. TJ OTT: COME ON, BABY, COME ON BABY, BLUEFIN TUNA! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WE GOT LINES TIGHT RIGHT NOW, LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS. PETE SPEECHES: WE PROBABLY GOT THIRTY FATHOMS TO GO. THIS FISH IS A LITTLE WILD STILL, RUNNING ON TOP. MIGHT BE A BIGGER FISH. GOOD JOB BRANDON! REEL NOW, REEL NOW, DOWN! NICE JOB, NICE JOB! ONCE WE GET CLOSER TO THIS TUNA, ERIN'S GOT TO DRIVE THE BOAT. SHE'S GOT TO GET HERSELF TOGETHER AND FAST. HOPEFULLY THE FISHING GODS WILL BE SMILING ON US AGAIN. TJ OTT: IT'S BEEN WELL OVER AN HOUR. DEFINITELY A TOUGH, TOUGH FISH. PROBABLY A REAL TOUGH 500-POUNDER. GOT HIM RIGHT HERE, TIGHT CIRCLES. JARRETT GAINS A FOOT AND HE TAKES TWO FEET BACK, SO IT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE TUNA GODS RIGHT NOW, MAN. HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOOD BOYS. BRANDON PIERCE: DEFINITELY COMING UP. PETE SPEECHES: BUMP IT AHEAD, AGAIN! SWIVEL UP. ERIN, LET'S GO, BUMP IT! NOW! AGAIN! ERIN SPEECHES: IT'S BUMPED! PETE SPEECHES: TRYING TO GET FISH IN HERE! GOT DEEP COLOR. TJ OTT: COMING NOW. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: GET READY! TJ OTT: RIGHT NOW, IT'S, IT'S GETTING CLOSE TO END GAME. WE KNOW HE'S CLOSE. PLEASE. WHEN HE COMES BACK OUT THIS WAY, THAT'S WHERE I'M GONNA GET HIM. PETE SPEECHES: ONE MORE TURN. BRANDON PIERCE: YEAH. TJ OTT: ALL RIGHT, HE'S GONNA COME BACK AROUND. I GOT HIM! GET A GAFF BUDDY. PETE SPEECHES: GOT HIM! GIMME, GIMME THE GAFF. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: GIMME THE TAIL ROPE! TJ OTT: WOO! PETE SPEECHES: STAY STANDING UP TIGHT. BRANDON PIERCE: GOT HIM? PETE SPEECHES: BIG BOY. TJ OTT: WOO! MIKE OTT: ALL RIGHT, YEAH BABY! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WOO! TJ OTT: WE GOT HIM, WE GOT HIM! PETE SPEECHES: SCORE! I THINK ERIN LEARNED THAT IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO COME TO THE BOAT NOT FEELING WELL AND SHE NEEDS TO BE AT HER PEAK WHEN SHE'S ON THE BOAT. I THINK THAT LESSON'S BEEN WELL LEARNED. ERIN SPEECHES: CAN I GET A "WHOOP, WHOOP!" BAD BOY, NICE JOB! PETE SPEECHES: I WANT ERIN TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S RISKS INVOLVED AND THAT YOU CAN'T LET YOUR GUARD DOWN. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU'RE ON THE BOAT. HOPEFULLY, WE CAN STAY ON TRACK AND KEEP CATCHING. BIG BOY. WE TAKE EVERY ONE WE CAN GET. ERIN SPEECHES: I USUALLY DO CUDDLE WITH THE TUNA, RIGHT WHEN THEY COME ON BOARD, YOU KNOW? MAKE THEM FEEL A LITTLE LOVE. BUT NOT TODAY. MIKE OTT: OH, YOU'RE ROLLING OVER! TJ OTT: NICE! MIKE OTT: OH, LOOK AT THAT! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: 91. TJ OTT: WHOO, ALL RIGHT GUYS, GREAT JOB. LET'S GET HIM PACKED AWAY. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: MAYBE WE'LL GET A MARKET HIGH. TJ OTT: AWESOME. PETE SPEECHES: BIG BOY. BRANDON PIERCE: IT'S A NICE ONE, WHAT DO YOU GOT? PETE SPEECHES: 99. BRANDON PIERCE: 99? PETE SPEECHES: 99. TJ OTT: PA POW! DAVE MARCIANO: LOOKS LIKE A NICE MORNING ANYWAY, THE SUN'S THE GONNA COME UP QUICK HERE. THIS IS OUR THIRD DAY ON THE WATER THIS WEEK. AND SO FAR, MY SO JOE AND I HAVE CAUGHT TWO FISH. LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A BOAT OR TWO ARE SCATTERED AROUND HERE. JOE MARCIANO: THINK THAT'S DOT COM OVER THERE. DAVE MARCIANO: [BLEEP] IS HE DOING OVER THERE? YOU CAN WATCH ALL YOU WANT, DAVE. WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP CATCHING TUNA. WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE NEW BOAT DIDN'T COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS? THERE'S A FISH. COMING UP! TO THE DOWN LINE. OH, THERE'S MORE THAN ONE HERE. THAT'S GOOD, WE'LL TAKE THAT. JOE MARCIANO: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! YEAH, YEAH, HE'S ON. OH, THAT SCREAMER, THAT BENT OVER RIGHT DOWN TO THE WATER. FRIGGING INHALED IT. YEAH, WE GOT ONE ON. HOPEFULLY WE CAN LAND HIM! HE'S A SCREAMER ALL RIGHT. TAKE THAT LINE BOY! ALL RIGHT, HEY, WE'RE GETTING LOW! DAVE MARCIANO: THERE YOU GO. HOW YOU HOLDING UP, YOU GOOD? JOE MARCIANO: MY ARM MIGHT FALL OFF, BUT WE'RE GOOD. DAVE MARCIANO: READY FOR A BREAK? JOE MARCIANO: YEAH. READY? DAVE MARCIANO: THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT, YEAH. WATCH HIM COMING AT THE BOAT, COMING AT THE BOAT! HE'S GOING UNDER THE BOAT! WATCH THE LINE, WATCH THE LINE! WE'RE GONNA LOSE HIM! DAVE MARCIANO: YEAH, HE'S A SCREAMER. WATCH HIM COMING AT THE BOAT, COMING AT THE BOAT! HE'S GOING UNDER THE BOAT! THIS IS OUR THIRD DAY ON THE WATER THIS WEEK AND SO FAR WE'VE GOT TWO FISH. BUT WOULDN'T IT JUST BE GREAT IF WE COULD MAKE IT THREE FOR THREE? WATCH THE LINE, WATCH THE LINE! HE'S GONNA CUT THE LINE. WE'RE GONNA LOSE HIM! JOE MARCIANO: YEP, CLEAR! WE ALWAYS GOT TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IF HE GETS STUCK ON SOMETHING ON THE BOAT, THE LINE WILL SNAP. ALWAYS GOT TO BE READY FOR HIM TO MAKE A RUN. DAVE MARCIANO: HE MIGHT BE TAIL WRAPPED. IF HE DOES, YOU WANNA DROP THAT LOOP ON THERE AND GET IT TIGHT. JOE MARCIANO: YEP. DAVE MARCIANO: ONCE HE FEELS IT, HE MIGHT SPAZ. JOE MARCIANO: YEAH. DAVE MARCIANO: WE'LL SEE HIM SOON HERE, JOE. HERE HE COMES. LET ME HAVE THE GAFF. COME ON IN QUICK. JOE MARCIANO: GOT HIM. YEAH, GOT HIM AGAIN! DAVE MARCIANO: LOOK AT THAT! THERE WE GO. SNAGGED HIM IN THE TAIL. SEE THAT? ANY IDIOT CAN HOOK THEM IN THE MOUTH. WE GOT THREE FISH AND THERE'S NO WAY I COULD'VE DONE IT WITHOUT JOE. IS HE READY? JOE MARCIANO: YEAH, I'M READY. DAVE MARCIANO: BUT WE'RE STILL NOT READY TO GO BACK IN. THE POSSESSION LIMIT IS FOUR FISH AND WE'RE GONNA GO FOR IT. JUST MAKES IT, 73. ABOUT AN EIGHTH OF AN INCH TO SPARE. NOW THAT WE'RE ONLY ONE FISH AWAY, I REALLY THINK WE CAN DO IT. NOW IF I WAS A BETTING MAN, THE WAY THE FISH HAVE BEEN THIS MORNING, THAT ROD'S GONNA BEND AGAIN. NOW FOR THE BIG ONE, WE'RE GONNA TOP IT OFF WITH LIKE AN 800-POUNDER. JOE MARCIANO: YEAH! [DRAKE COUGHING] DRAKE ROY: MY LIVER IS SO FAILING. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: YOU'RE LIVER'S FAILING, DID YOU PUKE? DRAKE ROY: NO, IT'S NOT MY STOMACH. WE'VE BEEN FISHING HARD FOR ALMOST FIVE STRAIGHT WEEKS NOW AND I WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH AN EXCRUCIATING PAIN IN MY SIDE. AND IT FEELS LIKE WHEN MY APPENDIX BURST. I CAN HARDLY STAND UP. I THINK I NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL MAN. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: JUNIOR, YOU SERIOUSLY WANNA GO TO THE HOSPITAL LIKE SERIOUSLY GO TO THE HOSPITAL LIKE? IS THAT LIKE A SERIOUS THING? DRAKE ROY: I CAN'T LIKE [BLEEP] TALK. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WELL, ARE YOU GOOD ENOUGH WHERE WE CAN DRIVE YOU THERE? DRAKE ROY: I JUST KNOW MY ORGANS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO FEEL LIKE THIS. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: I LOOK AT DRAKE AND I CAN TELL THAT HE'S NOT RIGHT. I WANNA KEEP FISHING BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T WANNA SEE DRAKE GET SERIOUSLY ILL ON THE BOAT. AND IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY AS CAPTAIN TO MAKE SURE HE'S HEALTHY. I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE RIGHT NOW. I GUESS I GOT TO CUT THIS TRIP SHORT AND TAKE DRAKE IN. I'D RATHER BE SAFE THAN SORRY GETTING HIM IN. I DON'T WANNA SEE HIM GET SICK OUT HERE. GET HIM SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS GONNA MEAN FOR THE REST OF MY SEASON. ONE THING'S FOR SURE, EVERYBODY ELSE IS STILL OUT CATCHING FISH. NOW, WE'LL GET DRAKE TAKEN CARE OF. HOPEFULLY, DRAKE'S BETTER IN A COUPLE DAYS OR SO, OR WHATEVER AND WE'LL GET BACK OUT FISHING. IF I GOT ANY HOPES OF CATCHING THEM, I BETTER FIGURE SOMETHING OUT FAST. LATER, DRAKE. TJ OTT: OUR PLAN CAME TOGETHER. HOPEFULLY, THE FISH IS WORTH GOOD MONEY. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: WHAT'S GOING ON, SCOTT? TJ OTT: HOPEFULLY, WE'LL LEAVE HERE SMILING. SCOTT: WHAT DO YOU GUYS GOT HERE? TJ OTT: WE GOT ONE NICE ONE FOR YOU BRO. SCOTT: LET'S CHECK HIM OUT, SEE WHAT WE GOT FOR YOU. TJ OTT: BRING HIM UP. WHAT DO YOU SAY, SCOTTSO? SCOTT: LOOKS KIND OF SKINNY FROM UP HERE THOUGH. TJ OTT: YOU USED TO BE OUR FAVORITE TUNA BUYER, YOU KNOW THAT. WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH, SCOTTSO? SCOTT: GOT 379 POUNDS. MIKE OTT: HEY, NOW! TJ OTT: WHEN A BUYER LOOKS AT A FISH, HE'S LOOKING FOR FAT CONTENT, GOOD COLOR, GOOD OIL AND ULTIMATELY, A GOOD CORE. IF ALL THESE THINGS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR, YOU'RE GONNA GET A GOOD PRICE FOR THAT FISH. SCOTT: IT'S GOT PLENTY OF FAT IN IT. IT'S GOOD COLOR, GOOD CORE. THIS FISH HAS EVERYTHING GOING FOR IT. YOU GUYS DID GOOD. $15 A POUND. TJ OTT: PA-POW! SCOTTSO, YOU THE MAN. SCOTT: GOOD JOB BRO. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAN. TJ OTT: THE HOT TUNA'S DEFINITELY FIRING ON ALL CYLINDERS RIGHT NOW, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE A GREAT TEAM. JUST THE WAY WE DREW IT UP. NARRATOR: HOT TUNA'S HEFTY FISH EXTENDS THEIR LEAD OVER THE FLEET. SCOTT: HOW'D YOU MAKE OUT, PETE? PETE SPEECHES: EH, WE GOT ONE FOR YA. I'M GLAD WE CAUGHT A TUNA ON THIS TRIP, BUT I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED IN ERIN'S BEHAVIOR. HOPEFULLY, SHE TURNS IT AROUND IN WEEKS TO COME. WHAT YOU GOT THERE, BOB? BOB: 286, PETE. PETE SPEECHES: WE'LL TAKE IT. SCOTT: A LITTLE LIGHT ON THE FAT, IN THE FAT DEPARTMENT HERE. OH BOY, MMM, I'LL GIVE YOU $11. PETE SPEECHES: ALL RIGHT, THAT'S, I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE LIGHT ON FAT, WE WERE HOPING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE. HOPEFULLY, THE NEXT FISH WILL HAVE A BETTER PAY DAY AND WE CAN CATCH UP WITH THE REST OF THE FLEET. NARRATOR: ERIN AND SARAH'S THREE GRAND TUNA PUSHES THEM INTO FOURTH PLACE. DAVE CARRARO: WHAT DOES MARCIANO HAVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE? GEORDIE SOUSA: HIS AUTOPILOT'S THE 28 MODEL. TWO HANDS, EIGHT KNOTS. DAVE CARRARO: THAT'S ABOUT IT. SANDRO MANIACI: YOU KNOW WHAT HE HAS? A THIRTY-SEVEN FOOT ASHTRAY. [LAUGHING] DAVE CARRARO: I'M GONNA TELL HIM YOU SAID THAT. THAT'S BAD. SANDRO MANIACI: THAT'S NOT NICE. I'M JUST KIDDING, I'M JUST KIDDING. DAVE CARRARO: WE'RE STILL NEXT TO MARCIANO AND THE HARD MERCHANDISE AND HE'S CAUGHT THREE FISH THIS WEEK. DAVE CARRARO: AT THIS POINT, I'M REALLY HOPING WE COULD JUST GET IT TOGETHER AND LAND SOME FISH OF OUR OWN. SEE MARCIANO DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ANYTHING BREAKING ANYWHERE. GEORDIE SOUSA: WHY? DAVE CARRARO: HE USES A BUCKET FOR A TOILET. HIS AIR. GEORDIE SOUSA: NO ONE'S EVER CLOGGED A BUCKET. DAVE CARRARO: HIS AIR CONDITIONING UNIT, HE'S GOT AN 8-1 UNIT. EIGHT KNOTS, ONE WINDOW OPEN. POOR MARCIANO. HE'S NOT EVEN HERE TO DEFEND HIMSELF. HE'S A GOOD GUY THOUGH. WE'RE JUST GIVING HIM HELL, WE LOVE DAVE. SANDRO MANIACI: LOOK AT THE SCREEN. GEORDIE SOUSA: HURRY UP. COME BACK, COME ON, WE JUST MARKED ONE, LOOK, LOOK! DAVE CARRARO: STREAKERS? SANDRO MANIACI: OH, YEAH, BABY, THAT'S HIM. GEORDIE, REEL THAT IN. DAVE CARRARO: WE'RE ON, WHOO-HOO-HOO!

GET EVERYTHING SQUARED AWAY. OH BABY, OH BABY. WHOO! SANDRO MANIACI: THERE YOU GO, BIG BOY, BIG BOY. DAVE CARRARO: FINALLY HOOKED UP ON A TUNA THIS WEEK. DAVE CARRARO: BUT NOW IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT AND JUST SEEING IS GONNA BE A PROBLEM. THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT, COMING RIGHT AT US, COMING RIGHT AT US, GOING DOWN. LET GEORDIE GET ON. SANDRO MANIACI: YUP, GOOD. [INAUDIBLE]. GEORDIE SOUSA: HE'S DOGGING US RIGHT NOW. DAVE CARRARO: COMING UP. REMEMBER, NOBODY STEP ON THAT HARPOON LINE. SANDRO MANIACI: I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING BACK HERE. DAVE CARRARO: IT'S TOUGH MAN; HE'S A TOUGH ONE. THIS FISH HAS GOT A LOT OF FIGHT IN HIM. WE MIGHT GET A SHOT HERE. SANDRO MANIACI: A SHOT IN THE DARK. BOTH: SHOT IN THE DARK. SANDRO MANIACI: COLOR. DAVE CARRARO: SWIVELS, SAME THING JUST KEEP THAT SAME PATTERN GOING RIGHT. NEXT TIME WE'LL BACK ON HIM, RIGHT THERE, HE'S 20 FEET AWAY. SWIVEL'S COMIN' ON. OH, NOT THERE, RIGHT THERE AND REEL.

SANDRO MANIACI: I CAN'T EVEN SEE ANYTHING. DAVE CARRARO: OH, NOW WE GOT THE FOG. GEORDIE SOUSA: COME ON, THIS IS CRUEL. DAVE CARRARO: I THINK THIS IS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.

GEORDIE SOUSA: OH NOW WE'RE AT 98 INCHES, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. DAVE CARRARO: YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. GEORDIE SOUSA: NICE WORK, NICE ROUND 100 INCH LATE AT NIGHT. DAVE CARRARO: PULLING THIS FISH ON BOARD IS A BIG RELIEF FOR US. IT TOOK ALL WEEK, BUT WE FINALLY GOT IT DONE. A CATCH LIKE THIS MAKES ME HAPPY THAT I'VE GOT BOTH SANDRO AND GEORDIE ON THIS BOAT WITH ME. ONLY GOOD TEAMWORK GETS THE JOB DONE IN THESE CONDITIONS. HARD WORK, PERSEVERANCE, YOU KNOCKED IT OUT. GEORDIE SOUSA: NICE WORK BOYS. DAVE CARRARO: I'M A NIGHT MAN. SANDRO MANIACI: YOU BET YOUR ASS YOU ARE. [PAUL HUMMING] PAUL HERBERT: IT'S PRETTY QUIET NOW. IT'S LIKE A GHOST TOWN HERE TODAY.

THERE WERE SOME TIMES THIS WEEK THAT I REALLY, REALLY MISSED HAVING ANOTHER GUY OR TWO ON THE BOAT. YEAH, WELL, I GOTTA GO IN, I GOTTA GET GEAR, I NEED ICE, I NEED FUEL. NEED STUFF TO COME BACK OUT. I'M RUNDOWN, I'M GETTING TIRED, YOU DO IT ALONE. AT THIS POINT, AFTER FISHING BY MYSELF, I BEAT MYSELF UP, I WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO GETTING A MATE. BUT I DON'T WANT ANYBODY ON THIS BOAT THAT DOESN'T WANNA BE HERE. HEADING IN. I'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT. YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE. THERE, MY AUTOPILOT. THAT'S MY, THAT'S MY OTHER GUY, RIGHT THERE.
