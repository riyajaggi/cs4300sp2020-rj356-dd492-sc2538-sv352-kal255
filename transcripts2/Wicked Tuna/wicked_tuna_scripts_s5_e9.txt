 SANDRO: We are on to something! NARRATOR: Wicked Tuna. TJ: Papow! NARRATOR: At the start of week 9, last season's champion, Hard Merchandise, leads the fleet, and Hot Tuna languish in the middle of the pack. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Georges Bank. It's home to some of the best fishing on the East Coast. Fishermen have been trying their luck here for hundreds of years. But many, unfortunately, have found only the bottom of the ocean. It's the ultimate gamble. Hundred and seventy miles from Gloucester. Expenses for a round-trip are far over a thousand dollars. And if anything goes wrong, you're stranded a long way from home. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ I've taken the gamble to head to Georges. Right now, we're in third place, and that's not where I wanna be. Last couple of weeks, we've been picking away inshore. Fishing inshore, you may get one here and there but we need to make something happen now. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ SANDRO: Right there! Right there! Right there! Right there! Stop! DAVE: We're on. SANDRO: Hey, stop. DAVE: Geordie, go forward right, forward right, forward right. GEORDIE: Forward right. We're good. SANDRO: Whoo! Baby! DAVE: That's good. If the fish are here, we can catch four in a single trip and jump ahead of everyone else. I wanna catch the limit, I wanna catch four, I wanna move back into first place. Come on, we gotta get it. GEORDIE: This first fish will cover expenses, but if we want to make a profit, we need to get a bit more. DAVE: Whoo! Come on, man, we need this boys. Ready? GEORDIE: Yeah. SANDRO: Fish should stop running, dumped a pile of line. That's how we want it to bite every time. DAVE: Eighty feet he's right here. SANDRO: Trying to get the fish in a pinwheel. Get him on his side. Give me some reverse. Swivel! You know it's a big boy. DAVE: Oh, yeah, he's big. Lot of money on the end of that line. GEORDIE: Color! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Get on! Get on! Come on! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ SANDRO: And neutral. DAVE: My driving force is to prove that we can be the number one boat in the fleet again. Got him! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Good job. SANDRO: And lift. GEORDIE: One, two, three. DAVE: Yeah. GEORDIE: There we go! SANDRO: Oh! GEORDIE: That was almost a broken arm. That is, getting that out of there. DAVE: Sandro, are you excited? SANDRO: Not really. Still got a long way to go. Coming out to Georges Bank, I wanna catch four fish, so as far as I'm concerned, we got three more to go. DAVE: Eighty-eight! Nice. That's a big fish. You know, as a fisherman, you always want, you always want more. Going to Georges is a gamble. But I really hope it pays off. JASON: Wait and wait and think positive. And, you know, these fish are known to travel in schools. JOE: Yeah. JASON: We caught that 800 pounder. JOE: Yep. There's definitely bigger fish around. JASON: There's definitely a nice big class of fish around. DAVE: It's week nine, and right now, we're in first place. JASON: Whoo-hoo! DAVE: Last week, we landed the biggest fish in the season. JASON: That's almost a 10 foot fish right there! DAVE: Without a doubt, this fish here, he's pushing 800 pounds. This is why we do it. We've been hot inshore. So, we're gonna stick it out at Jeffrey's Ledge this week. One of the oldest rules of fishing is; you don't leave fish to find fish. That's one of the first things you learn as a boat owner. We're catching fish, they're big fish, and we're gonna find some really big fish if we stick it out. JOE: Let's go get them. JASON: Let's go get them. [BEEPING SOUND] DAVE: Oh, oh, there they are. Wow, is he, is he coming back up, Geordie? GEORDIE: No. DAVE: Any minute. [BEEPING SOUND] Yup, I thought I saw that. I saw that. That's him, that's him, that's him. No! I saw that rod tip go. All right, guys. GEORDIE: We're on, baby. SANDRO: Easy, easy. DAVE: We need this fish right now. Wow, he's pretty wild, huh? SANDRO: Psycho. DAVE: Yeah, oh, yeah. He's gonna go clockwise. If we never invented time, would there be such thing as called clockwise and counter clockwise? SANDRO: Stop it. DAVE: No, that's, that's a good question. SANDRO: Can you reverse? Wow. He is rolling. DAVE: Nice, nice, nice. SANDRO: Watch that swivel, watch that swivel. DAVE: There you go. Nice, Geordie! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ You're okay. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ SANDRO: Hit him! DAVE: Got one! Yeah! He ain't a monster, but he's a keeper. Oh, he's not a keeper yet. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ I don't have him that good. GEORDIE: Tail rope's on the deck. DAVE: Gaff the head again. Yeah, gaff him. SANDRO: I'll get the tail, you got him. DAVE: Got one! GEORDIE: Got one! SANDRO: Got one! DAVE: Yeah! GEORDIE: Tie that one up! DAVE: Way to go. Money in the bank. SANDRO: In we go. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Oh, he's a little bigger than I thought. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Over the top, 76. I am the winner! SANDRO: It's about time you won. [LAUGHING] MAN: The bite's on at Georges. Dot Com's already got like two fish out there. LANCE: Getting some chatter in here. Sounds like they're starting to get them out there on Georges. PAUL: Yeah, they're gonna be talking like that. LANCE: Sounds pretty good. BRAD: We're not gonna run around like a bunch of chickens with our heads cut off, Lance. We can't. PAUL: We gotta stay to the grind. BRAD: We gotta stick to our game plan here. PAUL: It's week nine, the Wicked Pissah has caught 7 fish so far. We've been on a good roll, and we done it inshore. It's close to home. We're on Stellwagen. I know there's fish here. I do not wanna gamble and go offshore, 170 miles. I feel it in my gut that we can make it happen inside. LANCE: They're really talking it up. Better than sitting in here catching nothing. I thought Paul was a hardcore fisherman. But with not heading out to Georges, I'm starting to question that. I think he's kind of a wimp. I think he's scared to go out there. BRAD: I know he wants to catch fish. PAUL: We all do, that's why we're doing this. If we be patient, we're gonna get them right here. Lance, it, it aggravates me that he doesn't trust me. LANCE: It's, it's frustrating not having any say at all in where we fish. I would like to voice my opinion but that's just not how it works on this boat. PAUL: It's too dangerous for this little boat. If I told my father I have to go 170 miles to catch a tuna, he'd probably knock me out. [LAUGHING] What did you say? Whack! It costs a fish to go out there. The crew makes more money catching two a week inshore than we do catching four fish out there. LANCE: It's tough knowing that somebody else is getting fish and you're not. PAUL: Be patient, we're gonna catch 'em. TJ: Georgy Banky here we come baby! MIKE: See ya later, Gloucester! TJ: Oh, we're gonna be out there a few days on this one. JARRETT: Going far. TJ: We need it now man. We need it more than ever. We're past the halfway point of the season and we're not doing as well as I hoped. So far we're riding in the middle of the pack. The strategy for this particular trip is just to go out there and give it hell. Good reports coming off Georges Bank. so we're gonna take the trip. We've been getting the bites inshore, but that's not really what we wanna do. We need a good shot right now. We need to climb the leaderboard, gain our confidence. Definitely a little bit embarrassed that we're not performing as well as we should. I mean, every year it's been the same story, over and over, and you know what? I'm sick of the same story. MAN: What's going on? JARRETT: What's going on, man? MAN: Doing the snow right? JARRETT: Yeah, we're gonna do snow. TJ: When we head out to Georges, we've got to make sure we have lots of provisions. One of the beautiful things about fishing out of Gloucester is you have a facility like this, like Cape Pond Ice, that you can come to and blow in premium ice; you know, snow ice. That holds real well, it's real clean. Especially when you're trying to take care of your product. JARRETT: That was refreshing. TJ: Thank you, man. MAN: Yeah, you bet. TJ: Places like this are, you know, a dying breed. Gloucester's really been based and built around the fishing community, and Cape Pond Ice has been a huge part of that. Take care, guys, thanks again! MAN: Yeah, thank you! JARRETT: Have a good one, guys! TJ: Hundred and sixty miles of pain. Georgy Banky, please don't spank me. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ PAUL: There's a couple fish roaming through; which is really cool. We haven't seen that yet. LANCE: We're wasting our time in here. It's totally dead. BRAD: We're gonna catch fish here. It's looking very promising here. PAUL: We're inshore and we're already fishing, we didn't travel a hundred and seventy miles. If we had gone to Georges with everyone else, follow the leader, we'd still be steaming out there. Right place, right time. That's all it is. What's on that floater? Tuna? BRAD: Something. PAUL: Right there, something's on it. BRAD: Tuna, I hope. LANCE: Here we go! PAUL: Here we go! BRAD: I think it's a tuna. Got weight to him. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ PAUL: All right, I need to see, okay? Everyone needs to let me watch, see the line. It's nighttime, we can't see the line. It's important everyone's on the game, on everything. BRAD: All right, easy. Easy. He's right here. PAUL: Do you see what it is? BRAD: It's a tuna. I see him right here. PAUL: Just go easy, Brad, all right? BRAD: I'm going easy, man. PAUL: You gotta let me know where he's going. I cannot see! BRAD: Yeah, go right! Go right! Good! You might be able to dart him right there, Paul! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ Give me the harpoon ready, Lance. PAUL: It's ready, it's ready! DAVE: Well, we're about to get started here for the night. For some reason these fish have been night bites. It's a little tough, it's hard on the crew, we're burning the candle at both ends; being up day and night pretty much, but, hey, the bottom line is, we're catching fish, and we're getting nice fish. And I've seen some really big fish here on my machine. I don't think we've got the biggest fish out of here yet. A lot of the guys are headed outside to Georges. I think there's plenty of fish to catch inshore. [BEEPING SOUND] JOE: Coming up for it. DAVE: You gotta be careful when you follow the masses. The M is silent. [LAUGHS] JOE: Shooting straight up, shooting straight up. Oh yeah! DAVE: Yeah. JASON: That's what we like! JOE: He's coming up still, right at 10. Going back down. DAVE: He's on it. JOE: You got it?

JASON: That's a screamer! DAVE: Team Tuna is on another one! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: I ain't seen a mark like that in years. JOE: Tag you. DAVE: Stay in the bait. That's right, reel, Joe, he's still there. One more fish, if we can land this guy. And I know from the mark, this is a good fish. JOE: Yup. DAVE: It's another five to six grand in the bag. It definitely makes me feel good to know it was a good call not to go to Georges. Reel. Reel. Reel. We just got to get this fish in the boat. PAUL: Let's go, Brad, reel this sucker in. BRAD: Lance, come reel this fish. PAUL: No, wait. Wait. BRAD: Come reel the fish, I'll harpoon it. PAUL: Wait. Just wait, hold on. Wait, Brad. LANCE: He's coming. We'll get him, Brad, we'll get him, dude. PAUL: Hold on. Here we are inshore, hooked up, I am so happy I followed my gut instinct. Hopefully, Lance will learn to trust my judgment. I can't see. Where is he? Can't see. BRAD: Easy, Lance, easy, Lance. PAUL: Can't see. Can't see! Loosen up, go around. LANCE: He's coming around. BRAD: I'm gonna stick him, right here. PAUL: Go ahead, get him.

LANCE: Never have him until the tail wraps on man, a lot of things could go wrong. PAUL: I've had two harpoons in a fish; pulled both darts and broke the line. Doesn't matter 'till he's tail roped to the boat. DAVE: Charging it. Hook. You don't want to pop him up, right? This one's a tricky one. Let's hope our lucks holds, guys.

We've been in the middle of the pack and, when I feel, I come on a boat, I think, I bring a lot of drive. I believe in TJ as a captain and I believe in the Hot Tuna.

It's my first year with the boat and I'm just so stressed out. Lance is a hard ass worker, but the negativity that Lance is bringing to the boat right now is affecting the whole business. I have to be the one that makes the decisions this year. But, you keep questioning me. I'm the captain and owner of my boat. I can't have this against me.
