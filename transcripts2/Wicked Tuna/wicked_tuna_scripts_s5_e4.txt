 GREG: Man down! Hit him, hit him! JARRETT: Color, color, color! NARRATOR: Catching... DANIEL: Pa-pow. HOLLYWOOD: Woo! MIKE: Watch out, watch out, watch out! JARRETT: Forward, forward, forward! NARRATOR: Wicked Tuna. At the start of week four, of last season's champion, Hard Merchandise. Meanwhile Hot Tuna and Wicked Pissah trail the fleet. ♪ ♪ PAUL: Yeah? BRAD: Trust me. LANCE: We've caught three fish so far this season, and we still haven't seen a paycheck from Paul. He's got money in the bank, so his family's fine. But Brad and I have families to feed, too. In order to support my five-year-old daughter Scarlet I need to be consistently catching fish and bringing home a paycheck. PAUL: I'll get around to paying them, but if we don't catch fish, we don't get paid. That's why we grind and grind. I haven't had the time to sit down and write checks. BRAD: I'm fishing for my family to try to keep a roof over their heads. A good captain not only has to put us on the meat, but he's got to pay us in a timely manner. A responsible leader finds a balance. If he doesn't do that, crew's gonna leave. [beeping] PAUL: Hey, we're marking on here. [reel unspooling] BRAD: Here we go, here we go, tuna right. PAUL: Here we go. BRAD: Fish on. PAUL: Here we go. LANCE: Yeah, baby. We will take you. BRAD: Taking it to the house. Tuna on, right there, baby. Good bite, good bite. Alright. Move that rod over one space, Lance. [snap] Ah! PAUL: Gone? BRAD: It's off. PAUL: What happened? BRAD: It just came off, I don't know. PAUL: Pull the hook. BRAD: Son of a bitch. That is terrible. You finally get a bite, then you lose him. You get a pit in your stomach and you just feel sad. PAUL: You're always gonna pull a hook, always, always, always, always, always, always. BRAD: I hate that, that is the worst. Beautiful tuna. Ah. PAUL: Yep. LANCE: I can't be working for free. I need money. HOLLYWOOD: Who's better than me? [laughs] I'm the captain of the harpoon boat Lily. Most people call me Captain Hollywood 'cause I'm such a star. Anyone can reel a tuna fish up. Not everybody can harpoon a tuna. Unlike the rod-and-reel boats, we're warriors, not lazy thumb-suckers. We go out and hunt down the tuna. MARK: They're out jumping over there, jumping now. HOLLYWOOD: Marky flies overhead, spots the fish, and directs Jimmy to drive towards them. I take my place on the pulpit, I have to choose the perfect moment to throw the harpoon to hit the tuna. My goal this season is to catch a lot of bluefin tuna, make a lot of money and annihilate the Kristiana. GREG: Team Kristiana is here to kick Hollywood's ass. He's one cocky guy. Everybody's tired of hearing Hollywood trash talk and brag about himself. My job is to put the boat on the fish. Gibbs is a great harpooner. His eyes are like an eagle. GIBBS: Come on, where is he? GREG: This year we have brought on a new crewmember, Joel Finley, he'll jump right on and do whatever I need him to do. JOEL: That fish over here? GREG: How far you looking? JOEL: I've been in the fishery for 30 years, and I'm here on the Kristiana to help the Gregs shut Hollywood up. Let's pound 'em! HOLLYWOOD: Hey, look at this! JIMMY: Coming up on the Kristiana. HOLLYWOOD: Look at Marky coming in! JIMMY: He's coming down, he's gonna buzz us. [laughs] GREG: Here comes Mark coming in low. GIBBS: Yeah, there you go. He's trying to get under our skin. Here he comes, he's coming right on us. ♪ ♪ [laughs] HOLLYWOOD: Apparently Greg can't function without his little blue pills, so this season I'm calling him Captain Blue Pill. GIBBS: There's Hollywood over there. JOEL: He is coming right up on us. GIBBS: Yeah. JOEL: Apparently he's not shy. HOLLYWOOD: Hi, Blue Pill! GREG: Tell your pilot to stay off the roof. HOLLYWOOD: He wasn't on your roof. He's coming to say hello, he loves you. GREG: Go home. Go take care of your own business. HOLLYWOOD: Those guys on the Kristiana think they're competition, but they're not. They're not even in our league. [laughs] I'll see you later! JOEL: Feel that hot air? Big talker, that guy. GREG: We need to put Lily in its place. Catch some today. HOLLYWOOD: We're going to run circles around those guys this year. [laughs] ♪ ♪ TJ: Whoa. DANIEL: Hey. TJ: Dan the man. TIM: What's happening? TIM: Ready to go fishing. TJ: You ready, Danny, you ready to roll? DANIEL: Yeah. TJ: You look excited. DANIEL: Yeah. TJ: We've got two really nice fish so far this season, we're definitely trailing some of the other guys in the earning department. We definitely need to shake things up a little bit, and we could certainly use a little bit of luck, so I'm bringing my nephew Daniel on board this trip. You think we're going to catch one? DANIEL: Yeah. TJ: Yeah? TIM: Yeah, man. TJ: Alright, we need that positive motivation. Daniel's eight years old and he absolutely loves fishing. We've waited quite a few years for him to get to this age before we brought him offshore on one of these tuna trips. DANIEL: I'm really excited to go tuna fishing, because this would be my first one to catch ever, and I hope it's a thousand-pounder, and I hope it's gonna be really fun. TJ: You ready to roll or what? DANIEL: Yeah. TIM: This is Danny's first bluefin trip on board. It's very exciting to me, I mean, for us to be able to catch a fish with him would be probably one of the best things I've done in my life, besides catching with my boys, you know. TJ: What you guys talk about on the way up? DANIEL: How we're gonna catch a big tuna. TJ: Really? DANIEL: Yeah. TJ: Poppy fart at all in the truck? DANIEL: No. TJ: No? TIM: We're here, let's go fishing. I'm ready. TJ: Alright, let's go. Go ahead, Danny, go start the motor, bud. HOLLYWOOD: Who's better than me? Like I say, surely isn't Captain Blue. I don't know, I want to get into him now, I can't wait here. Killing me. This is our first day out on the water. Unlike the rod and reel guys, we can't fish every day because of the weather conditions. And the harpoon season is a limited season. As the water temperature gets warmer, the fish start diving deep for the rod-and-reel guys to catch. MARK: I got 'em over here, come, come right a touch. Once I see the tuna, I guide Jimmy to sneak up to them from behind. So they don't know they're being chased. We don't want them to dive or scatter. Pick up the power a little bit, that's it, you got to pick up the speed, you're going downwind here. HOLLYWOOD: There they are. I see them! You can see 'em. There, set your speed, Jimbo. We got 'em, right? JIMMY: Once Marky finds the fish, I line the boat up so Hollywood can harpoon them. It's a lot to it, because the fish are moving and the boat's moving. MARK: Ten boat lengths, eleven boats. MARK: Looking good right now. Three boat lengths. MARK: I usually zero in on the biggest fish 'cause that means more money. I'm the guy that's gonna get you that bigger fish, too. Yeah, that's the one, Billy, right there. Come on, baby. HOLLYWOOD: Bingo! Bingo! Hit him, hit him! HOLLYWOOD: Hit him! JIMMY: Got him! HOLLYWOOD: Got him, got him. Nice action. Look at that thing. JIMMY: That's fast action there, Cap. HOLLYWOOD: Nice one, too. Look at this thing coming, like a submarine. How's the Greg and Greg Show doing? JOEL: Damn it, it looks like Billy caught a tuna. GIBBS: Right in front of us way out there. GREG: I'm thinking right here. GIBBS: I don't understand, we're nice guys, and he's a douche to everybody. Mouthy, and the prick still catches fish. Ugh, blows my mind. HOLLYWOOD: Ah, he's a freaking slob. Alright, here we go, take him right. How's that, Greg and Greg? Look at the size of that thing. Jeez, what a shot. MARK: I see a fishy. Nice one. HOLLYWOOD: Who's better than me? Who's better than Captain Hollywood? Just tell me. JIMMY: Go ahead, Cap. HOLLYWOOD: We got 96. Probably a $10,000 tuna. Yeah, baby! [laughs] JIMMY: Beautiful way to start the season. PAUL: We're over it, yeah, we lost a fish and we're over it. That's it; we're over it. You know, I've lost more tuna than this whole fleet will catch in a lifetime by the age of 15. LANCE: Joke. Pathetic. We've already lost one fish today, so it's really hard to listen to Paul go on and on and on, especially since he hasn't paid us for the first three tuna we've caught this season. [beeping] We got a streaker. We got one coming right up at the bait right now. PAUL: Two of 'em. LANCE: Two of 'em. Come on, baby! BRAD: Keep coming. [reel unspooling slowly] [beeping] [reel unspooling] LANCE: We're on, we're on, we're on, we're on! PAUL: Here we go. LANCE: Just hooked up, baby, that's when the chumming pays off! Oh, this is a big fish, screaming line out right now. We got him on, we got him on, baby. PAUL: He's big, he's an 800-pound fish, this fish. 20 grand. BRAD: We really need this, we're gonna try hard, we're gonna get it. PAUL: This is a big fish. I can tell by how much line he's got out. I know, I've caught one before. [laughs] Let Brad take it, Lance. LANCE: Ready, Brad? BRAD: Yup. LANCE: Take your time, Brad-o. PAUL: Push it, push it! [laughs] Reel, reel. BRAD: He's a giant. Giant Atlantic bluefin tuna. LANCE: Yeah, baby. BRAD: I've been catching tuna for 36 years now. And I know we have to put extra pressure on a big fish by increasing the tension on the line. Keeping pressure on him. We're getting a few inches of line, but that's all. We need to let him tow the boat, let him wear down. We really got to take our time and nail it the right way. 15,000-pound boat, and he's pulling the stern right to him. LANCE: Get him, Brad-o. PAUL: He's coming up on top right now, he's going to break the surface, and I'm trying to back up on him so we can get on him. BRAD: Paul, don't back down on him. We'll never wear him down this way. PAUL: I like to back down on 'em to get over them, to get 'em down where you can get him on his side, it's the only way you're gonna take a fish. BRAD: Stop backing down. Now there's slack in the line. That fish can run free and make evasive moves. When he does that, the hook hole in his mouth will get bigger, and he could pull the hook at any time. PAUL: I want to get on him. I've fought fish a thousand times just like this before. BRAD: We want to stop him, we don't want to keep letting him breathe. The more we let this guy run around, the more chances he's got to pull the hook. We should have stopped the boat and let him really pull. 90% of the fish that I've caught, I don't even start the boat. We're gonna lose him. Hey, I want to, I want to slow down here. PAUL: I'm not stopping, Brad. ♪ ♪ BRAD: Stop backing down. PAUL: Want to get on him. BRAD: We want to stop him, we don't want to keep letting him breathe. We're fighting a monster tuna, but Paul's backing down on him and letting him run wherever he wants. The more we let this fish run, the more slack he's got, the more chances he's got to get free. We're gonna lose him. Hey, I want to, I want to slow down here. PAUL: I'm not stopping, Brad! BRAD: He's running out on top again. We got to put the brakes on him. LANCE: I know I'm not the tuna expert, but what Brad's saying makes perfect sense to me. BRAD: He's swimming as fast as the boat away. Just swimming away from us pretty hard. He's paddling. Oh! PAUL: Ugh! He's gone. BRAD: I'm so pissed off right now. I think we lost it 'cause we backed down too much. That fish swam around wherever he wanted to go and finally pulled the hook. LANCE: It, it popped off. Paul brought Brad on because he's one of the best fishermen that he knows. I can't understand why he won't take advice from him. I don't know if Paul's just trying to show he's the boss or what. [laughs] PAUL: What are you gonna do? Go home and cry? Cry in your milk? I'm the one with the $200,000 boat. They got nothing on the line. My whole life is on the line here. This is my boat, my way, I'm the captain, I'm the boss, and that's that. BRAD: I've caught a ton of tuna. He should at least listen to me. I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't back down. There's just certain things we got to change or this is not gonna work out on this boat. DAVE: We gonna tear them up now? We're in second place in the earnings this week, and I don't like being second. Hard Merchandise, he's leading the fleet, and we lost to him last season. I want to be the best boat in the fleet. My number one goal this week is to move into the top spot. A lot of life here, a lot of whales. SANDRO: Definitely bait on the bottom. DAVE: Got a pretty good shot right here. Tons of bait, tons of whales. We'll see what we can do. Got to get one here. GIBBS: They're right in here somewhere. JOEL: Yep, looked pretty interesting right there. Birds are a good sign of life. Where's there's birds, there's bait, where there's bait, there's tuna. GIBBS: Lily caught a tuna earlier, but we haven't had any luck yet. The advantage Hollywood has over us is he's got Mark flying. He thinks he's a lot better than he really is. If he didn't have Mark, he wouldn't catch half as many fish as he catches. We don't have a spotter pilot. We have to watch for signs of tuna pushing through the water. Water just pours off their back, so we call it making water. Whale, as well. Look, there's fish in there, too. GREG: Whales in there with them. Right here, right here, right here, right here, right here. It's fish, it's fish, it's fish. GIBBS: Alright, let me down, let me down, let me down. 80 feet. GREG: They're making water, Greg. GIBBS: Yep, I see 'em. GREG: I think they're going a little 11, little 11! Point 'em out! JOEL: Right here, go right, go right. GIBBS: Look over here, over here, over here. JOEL: Go right. GREG: Come on, Neptune, give us a chance here. GIBBS: Over here! GREG: Up and down under his feet. GIBBS: Right here, right here, come on, come on, come on, come on! GREG: Right here on your left, your left! 10 o'clock. JOEL: 10 o'clock, right there. GREG: Oh, is that a... JOEL: No, it's a whale. GREG: That's a whale, sorry. Aww. The whale spooked 'em. Hopefully, they're gonna pop back up here, we're gonna get a chance. This is looking real fishy in here right now. HOLLYWOOD: Yeah, go ahead, Marky. MARK: Yeah, I got a line running out to the east. HOLLYWOOD: Alright, I'm coming that way. Our first trip out, we're up by one fish, go try to get another one. Those guys on the Kristiana, we're gonna crush 'em. MARK: 20 boats, maybe a little less now. HOLLYWOOD: We need another one. MARK: You can see the water from them there. Your 11:30. Eight boats and a touch left. Yep. Steady like that. Four boat lengths. HOLLYWOOD: Right here! MARK: Three, four boat lengths. Come left again a little. Left. They're swimming from your left to your right, right now. 1 o'clock, two boat lengths or so. Yep, steady like that. HOLLYWOOD: Tell me when! JIMMY: Hit him! MARK: Two boat lengths or so. Yep, steady like that. HOLLYWOOD: Tell me when! JIMMY: Hit him! HOLLYWOOD: Hit him! That's two! JIMMY: Bingo! HOLLYWOOD: Ha! There's another one, Cap, right in the head! Whacked another one. MARK: Good boys! HOLLYWOOD: Take the pole right on. I'm gonna measure him up right now. JIMMY: Oh, yeah. HOLLYWOOD: 75, Jimbo. JIMMY: Nice! Number two. Little fish, big check. It's all good. MARK: Big belly. HOLLYWOOD: It's two more than Captain Blue. MARK: I got 'em over here, they're coming back up, coming back up. HOLLYWOOD: See if we can get another one. One more would be nice. Go ahead, Jimmy. I don't want to jinx myself and start thinking I'm wonderful, but who's better than me? The Gregs? I don't even want to pick on them, they're so pathetic! MARK: 12 o'clock, probably six boats going dead away from you right now. Paddling, paddling. Hold that steady. Four boats or so now. Right, right, right, boat length and a half. Like that. HOLLYWOOD: Hit him! JIMMY: Boom, baby! Yes, yes, yes! HOLLYWOOD: Reach out and touch somebody! [laughs] We got three. Come on, take him, take him. Here, watch out, will you? I'm on the rail. Watch out, yeah, I got him. I'm gonna hand him to you, okay? JIMMY: Can't get him. HOLLYWOOD: Pull him right over here. Another one! Matching model. Ha! Right here, baby! It's our lucky day. 78, right there. JIMMY: You're back! HOLLYWOOD: Who's better than me? [laughs] Take that, Kristiana. ♪ ♪ DANIEL: I want to catch one! TJ: Yeah, me too, bud. We're off to a little bit of a slow start on Daniel's first bluefin trip, but he's having a blast. TIM: Watch out, watch out! TJ: He has so much energy. MIKE: He's up and down, he's all over the place. He's giving us a workout. Be careful. TJ: I'll never forget what it was like to catch that first bluefin with my father. To see one of those things and to watch that rod bend, and it was, you know, an amazing experience, and I want Daniel to experience that as well. DANIEL: Can I do it? I want to catch some bait. MIKE: Hold it just like that. Just go up and down. You'll feel them hitting it. I remember the feeling I had the first time I caught one of these beautiful bluefins, I was hooked. I wanted to catch these things for the rest of my life. And there would be no better feeling than sharing that with Daniel. Boom! DANIEL: What! MIKE: Got 'em. DANIEL: I bet this bait is gonna get my first bluefin. Now if the tuna would just hurry up and get here. ♪ ♪ HOLLYWOOD: Nice way to start, huh, PJ? First day I come in with three fish, who's better than me? PJ: No one, man. No one's better than you. HOLLYWOOD: I got to feed my family, Cap. PJ: 152 dresser. It's tiny. HOLLYWOOD: I know. What are you gonna do? The buyer's looking for good color and lots of fat. The higher the fat content, the higher price per pound. What do we got, PJ? PJ: It's, uh, a little on the dark side. It does have some harpoon damage on it. That's gonna be a little deduction. HOLLYWOOD: There's always some excuse with you. PJ: It's a no-fat fish. Can't put fat in them. It's gonna be, uh, $6 a pound. HOLLYWOOD: Ah, God. JIMMY: That's alright. PJ: Let's see what the other ones look like. HOLLYWOOD: Alright, let's look at number two. What do we got, PJ? PJ: 176! 176 pounds. JIMMY: Nice! HOLLYWOOD: Nice. PJ: Where are the big ones? HOLLYWOOD: I don't know. What do you think? PJ: Well, it's another red meater. There's no fat at all, $7 a pound. HOLLYWOOD: Alright. It's the best you can do? PJ: Something. One more? HOLLYWOOD: What do you think of this one, PJ? A little better than the last few, huh? PJ: 353-pounder. JIMMY: That's a little better. HOLLYWOOD: Let's see what we got, PJ. PJ: Where's the fat? Where's the fat? I don't see any fat. HOLLYWOOD: Come on. PJ: This one here, $8 a pound. HOLLYWOOD: It's not 28 bucks a pound, but it's something, right? We made $5,000 today. I'm not totally excited, but I'm happy. The best part about this is, Captain Blue, you know, Greg and Greg, your buddies. PJ: Yeah. I know 'em, yeah. HOLLYWOOD: They didn't even get no fish. We got three. NARRATOR: Lily's three low-quality fish give them a disappointing payday. [bird squawks] [snoring] MARCIANO: You know Jay's not worried about making a big deal about his birthday. JOE: Yeah. MARCIANO: But I got him a cake anyway. JOE: Alright. MARCIANO: So when he wakes up, we'll, you know, make fun of him a little bit. JOE: Alright, cool. MARCIANO: 'Cause he's getting to be an old man like me. The last few weeks, our luck really turned around. And now, we're back at the top of the fleet. How do you write 'Happy Birthday' in shorthand? JOE: Just do it 'HBD.' Perfect! MARCIANO: Alright. JOE: Hopefully, it tastes better than it looks. MARCIANO: Without the crew, I can't catch fish. I'm nothing more than a glorified, two-bit, half-wit tour bus driver. Joe and I baked you a cake while you were sleeping. JAY: Did you really? MARCIANO: Well, we didn't really bake it, but... It is important to show him my appreciation, but you don't want him to get used to it. JOE: Oooh! JAY: H-B-D-J, happy face. MARCIANO: Alright. Are you gonna cut the cake? JAY: Aw, jeez. Dig in. [laughs] [laughing] MARCIANO: Food fight! [laughing] They can make the biggest mess they want. Heck, they're the ones that are gonna clean it up, anyway. [laughing] It's only the captain who gets to have his cake and eat it, too. [laughing] Uh-uh! JAY: Thanks, man! JOE: Happy birthday, Jay. JAY: Thank you. [beeping] GEORDIE: He came all the way up to 75 feet. DAVE: There he is. That's him. We've been fishing, and we have nothing to show for it. It's absolutely terrible. To top it off, we've been marking for two hours, and the tuna just will not bite. GEORDIE: There's one coming up. There's one coming up. DAVE: There's two there. [beeping] GEORDIE: Yep. DAVE: Wow, look at that. X marks the spot, right there, look at that. SANDRO: Those are big. DAVE: Yeah, you got two corkers under the boat right now. Here we are, we got all the fish under the boat, we can't get a bite. We've heard others have been catching tuna this week, and that makes me even more frustrated that we haven't caught. First here. [beeping] SANDRO: Sometimes the fish just don't bite, no matter what you put in front of their face. DAVE: Can't buy a bite. [beeping] SANDRO: There, there! We're on, we're on, we're on! DAVE: Now we have one! About freaking time. Get him, get him, get him! Don't let him go! DAVE: Here we are, we got all the fish under the boat, we can't get a bite. [beeping] SANDRO: There, there! We're on, we're on, we're on! DAVE: Now we have one. Keep cranking, keep cranking. SANDRO: About time. GEORDIE: He's coming! DAVE: Out of the way. Fish on the machine, too, look! [beeping] About freaking time. All we have to do is hold on to him now. SANDRO: Now we got to try and bring him to the boat. DAVE: Sandro, you want to get on the rod, have Geordie drive? We designed the boat specifically so we have controls in the back, so the guy driving the boat always knows where the tuna is. This will definitely increase our chances of losing less fish and catching more. SANDRO: Swivel. ♪ ♪ Nail it! Nail it! Hurry up! DAVE: Got him. ♪ ♪ Gaff him in the head. SANDRO: Got him. DAVE: Alright, drag is off. I'm coming with the tail rope. GEORDIE: Woo! Alright. There we go! DAVE: Nice, yeah, nice going, nice job, bro. GEORDIE: Atta boy, Dave. DAVE: This was an extremely short fight. Perfect. The shorter the fight, the higher the probability you're gonna get him. GEORDIE: Are you ready? DAVE: Bring him in. SANDRO: One, two, three. GEORDIE: 77, we could call that. DAVE: This fish will probably dress out around 300 pounds. Let's go get another one. This new boat is the ultimate tuna-catching machine. LANCE: What do you think of a nice tuna check when we go in? PAUL: Oh, write one out? Alright. I think we were fishing every day. LANCE: Really? Hmm. So far on this trip, we've already lost two paychecks. And to top it off, I still haven't been paid for the first three fish we caught this season. PAUL: Weren't we out to sea every day? We weren't on land? LANCE: Why are you busting my balls? All I said it would be nice to get a fish check! PAUL: We go in today. We'll stay in and I'll write checks. Okay? We'll stay in for the day and we'll go the next day. BRAD: Oh, Jesus. Paul's acting like a jerk. Being a good captain is not just about putting fish on the boat. It's also about honoring your commitments to your crew, which includes paying them on time. PAUL: We'll miss a day's fishing so we can write checks. LANCE: I didn't know it takes a whole day to write a check, Paul. I usually write a little quicker than that. PAUL: I'll go in right now. That's what we'll do. I ain't gonna deal with this bull no more. I'm over it, Lance. LANCE: I ask you one simple thing and you flip the [bleep] out. Every time I bring up money, you get all mad. Like, I'm just talking to you. Is it wrong for me to worry about how I'm gonna feed my daughter, Paul? Is that wrong? There's no way you can go home and tell your five-year-old daughter that Daddy didn't make any money this week, so she'll have to go without dinner. PAUL: Lance wants his money right now to feed his daughter, so... LANCE: Right, man. I want my money. PAUL: I've never, ever had anyone question me with money in my life. LANCE: I'm starting to see a different side of Paul, and it's a side of Paul that I don't like. BRAD: This is getting bad. ♪ ♪ [snoring] [beeping] JARRETT: It's the first time like that in, like, three hours. I 100% feel like I'm part of the Ott family. By all means, I do. So, right now, I'm super pumped having little Danny on the boat. It's 3 o'clock in the morning. I've been up all night long trying to get this bite. I'm gonna see to it that this kid sees a tuna tonight. [beeping] The screen just turned blue, so I just started dumping chum. [beeping] [reel unspooling slowly] Oh! We're on! We're on! We're on! ♪ ♪ We're on, dude. TIM: Daniel! DANIEL: Yeah? TIM: We got them on, come on. There's no way I'm gonna let Daniel miss this, and I want him to see this, because I want him to have the experience of seeing a bluefin or catching a bluefin like we have. DANIEL: We're hooked up, pa-pow! I'm tired and excited at the same time. JARRETT: It's heavy as [bleep]. Watch out, TJ, it's going in front of the boat. TJ, watch out! Forward, forward, forward.
