 PAUL HERBERT: WE'RE CATCHING UP! NARRATOR: THESE FISHERMEN FIGHT TO EARN A LIVING. BRAD KRASOWSKI: THIS IS CRAZY MAN. NARRATOR: CATCHING... TIM OTT: NOW WE GOT A LITTLE BATTLE AHEAD OF US, AND HERE WE GO! GO MAMA, GO! NARRATOR: WICKED TUNA. TIM OTT: THIS IS WHAT WE CAME FOR, BOYS. NARRATOR: LAST WEEK'S JOURNEY TO GEORGES BANK WHOSE FOUR-FISH HAUL TOOK THE LEAD AWAY FROM DEFENDING CHAMPION HARD MERCHANDISE. DAVE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT, WE READY BOYS? JASON MUENZNER: YUP. JOE MARCIANO: YUP, ALL SET. JASON MUENZNER: WE'RE JUST READY TO GET BACK OUT THERE AND CATCH THEM UP. JOE MARCIANO: LET'S DO IT UP, LET'S CATCH SOME FISH. JASON MUENZNER: ALL SET. THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES WE'VE LEFT AND TJ'S NOT TIED UP AT THE DOCK. JOE MARCIANO: YEAH, SHOCKING, ISN'T IT? DAVE MARCIANO: DAVE AND TJ ARE RUNNING OUT TO GEORGES. BUT THAT LEAVES ALL THE HOT SPOTS INSIDE FOR US. JASON MUENZNER: WATCH THE ROD. DAVE MARCIANO: WE FISHED THERE LAST WEEK. IT'S A SHARK. BUT WE CAME HOME WITH NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT. DAMMIT! BUT I'VE BEEN IN THIS GAME LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW YOU CAN'T CHASE THE BITE. BY THE TIME YOU HEAR THE NEWS YOU ALREADY MISSED THE NEWS. WE HAVE TO STICK TO OUR PLAN, STAY CONSISTENT AND THE FISH WILL COME. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN GET A KEEPER. TJ OTT: CAN YOU HEAR ME ON THIS ONE? DAVE CARRARO: YEAH. TJ OTT: WHAT ARE YOU SEEING? DAVE CARRARO: NOTHING, GOT NO MARKS. TJ OTT: YEAH. LAST WEEK WE STEAMED OVER 150 MILES TO FISH IN GEORGES BANK. ALL RIGHT. TIM OTT: NICE! TJ OTT: AND IT PAID OFF WITH TWO FISH WORTH OVER $20,000. CREW: WHOO! TJ OTT: PA-POW! SO I MADE THE DECISION TO DOUBLE DOWN AND COME BACK. GEORGES BANK IS ONE OF THE OCEAN'S PERFECT FEEDING GROUNDS. OUT THERE YOU'LL SEE EVERYTHING. BIRD LIFE, MAMMAL LIFE AND NUMEROUS TYPES OF BAIT FISH WHICH DRAW IN LARGE NUMBERS OF TUNAS. LAST WEEK YOU GUYS CLEANED THEM OUT. YOU TOOK A METRIC TON OUT OF HERE. DAVE CARRARO: WE HAD A BLOOD BATH. WE CAUGHT FOUR FISH OUT HERE LAST WEEK. GET HIM! GOT ONE. SANDRO MANIACI: TAKE THE SHOT! DAVE CARRARO: I GOT HIM! IT WAS THE MOST PROFITABLE TRIP OF THE SEASON SO FAR. SO WE CAME OUT WITH TJ TO TRY AND DO IT AGAIN. A BLANK SCREEN FOR THE LAST 10 MINUTES. TJ OTT: WE HAVEN'T MARKED ANYTHING YET. I'M GETTING NERVOUS, WE MAY HAVE MADE THE WRONG MOVE. [BEEPING] TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WE'RE MARKING THEM. ALL THOSE GUYS RUNS OFFSHORE FOR WHAT? THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS HAVE TO GO 200 MILES OFFSHORE TO CATCH A TUNA THAT I CAN CATCH 10 MILES FROM MY BEDROOM WINDOW. WE'RE GONNA GET NICE QUALITY FISH RIGHT HERE. YEAH, YOUR ODDS OF HOOKING UP ON GEORGES ARE FAR GREATER THAN THEY ARE INSHORE. BUT IT COMES AT A COST. THE FUEL COST OVER $1,000. THE BAIT AND TACKLE, A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS. ICE, ANOTHER HUNDRED. BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, IT'S A $2,000 TRIP. ALL WE NEED IS A FEW DIAMOND QUALITY FISH HERE AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE A PROFIT. WHOO, THAT'S THE MARK! ANY MINUTE IT COULD HAPPEN. GET READY. DAVE MARCIANO: THIS IS IT GUYS, LET'S DO THIS. IT'S MORE THAN HALFWAY THROUGH THE SEASON, WE'RE LESS THAN $1,000 BEHIND DOT COM SO IF WE CAN HOOK UP AND GET A FISH RIGHT OFF THE BAT, IT COULD BE ENOUGH TO PUT US BACK ON TOP. COME ON. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: GOOD SPOT HERE. I THINK IT COULD HAPPEN. GOT A TIDE CHANGE COMING UP, JUST GOT SOME FRESH BAIT. WHAT DO YOU THINK, TRAV? TRAVIS BROWN: IT'S BOUND TO HAPPEN HERE EVENTUALLY AND HOPEFULLY, IT'S TODAY. DAVE MARCIANO: COME ON, BITE ME! TRAVIS BROWN: THERE IT IS. DOWN ROD. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: NICE! TRAVIS BROWN: GOT HIM ON! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: NICE! TRAVIS BROWN: GET HIM, COME ON! IT'S DEFINITELY A TUNA. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: THIS FISH IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED, A NICE INSHORE BITE AND IT'S GOT SOME WEIGHT. IF WE CAN GET A TAIL ROPE ON THIS FISH, IT COULD BE A $5,000 PAYCHECK FOR US. WE GOT A BIG FISH ON HERE. I HAVEN'T HAD THIS MUCH LINE OUT ON A FISH IN A LONG TIME. JUST TRYING AND CHASE THIS FISH DOWN, GET AS MUCH LINE BACK ON THE REEL AS POSSIBLE. REEL, REEL, REEL. JASON MUENZNER: WE'RE GETTING A BITE, WE'RE GETTING A BITE, WE'RE ON! JOE MARCIANO: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! DAVE MARCIANO: WHAT? JASON MUENZNER: THAT'S A FISH, A BIG BOY! DAVE MARCIANO: GET IT UP HERE, 'CAUSE WE GOTTA GET IT CLOSE! READY? JOE MARCIANO: YUP. DAVE MARCIANO: I KNEW IF WE JUST STAYED THE COURSE, EVENTUALLY WE HOOK UP IN SHORE. BUT NOW THE TOUGH PART STARTS. GETTING IT IN THE BOAT. REEL, REEL, REEL, REEL, REEL, REEL. GOOD JOB, GUYS, GOOD JOB! JASON MUENZNER: DOING A LOT OF HEADSHAKES. DOING LOTS OF HEAD SHAKES. DAVE MARCIANO: IF WE CAN LAND THIS ONE, ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER FISH FOR THE HARD MERCHANDISE. IT'S NICE, WE GOT HIM RIGHT OFF THE BAT IN THE MORNING HERE, LET'S JUST HOPE WE CAN GET HIM. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: COME ON, GET SOME, TRAVIS. GET SOME, BROTHER, GET SOME. WE GOTTA GET THIS FISH. WE'RE TRAILING THE WHOLE FLEET RIGHT NOW SO I DON'T HOPE THAT WE LAND THIS FISH. I NEED TO LAND THIS FISH. I SEE HIM. EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY. LET ME SEE THIS FOR A LITTLE BIT. FISH IS RIGHT UP THERE ON TOP. HE'S LIKE 40 FEET AWAY. WE NEED THIS FISH BAD. TRAVIS BROWN: GO BACK ON HIM. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. NOW GO BACK ON HIM. GO BACK ON HIM. OH, THERE HE GOES! TRAVIS BROWN: THIS FISH DON'T WANT NONE. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: HE'S GOING TO THE BOTTOM. IT'S MAKING A RUN! DAVE MARCIANO: THIS TUNA IS RUNNING TO ME. LET'S HOPE WE GET HIM, BOYS. JASON MUENZNER: BEEN DOING A LOT OF HEADSHAKES, SO BABY HIM, BUDDY. DAVE MARCIANO: IT'S DEFINITELY A KEEPER GUYS. JASON MUENZNER: BIG BOY, HE'S JUST HANGING DEEP AND NOW HE'S JUST, OH, AS I SAID IT, HE MUST HAVE HEARD ME. SMART FISH. JOE MARCIANO: HERE HE COMES. JASON MUENZNER: COLOR, WE GOT COLOR! COUSIN JJ'S TURN! DAVE MARCIANO: ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LET'S HOPE WE GET THIS ONE! ONE MORE CLOSER TO DAVE AND THE DOT COM! GOOD JOB, JAY, KEEP GOING! GOOD JOB, JAY, KEEP GOING! JASON MUENZNER: OH, COME ON. DAVE MARCIANO: OH (BLEEP). PULLED THE HOOK. JASON MUENZNER: PULLED THE HOOK. SEE THAT BEND? THAT FAR DOWN HIS (BLEEP) THROAT. DAVE MARCIANO: PULLING THE HOOK IS REALLY DISAPPOINTING. IF WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN THAT FISH ON THE BOAT IT PROBABLY WOULD HAVE PUT US BACK ON TOP OF THE FLEET. JOE MARCIANO: IT'S PART OF IT. IT SUCKS. WE LOST HIM. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: IT'S A 500 POUNDER, EASY. ALL DAY. TRAVIS BROWN: TALK TO ME. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: LET HIM KICK AROUND, LET HIM KICK AROUND. THE OTHER WAY, THE OTHER WAY. JUST DOING A LITTLE PINWHEEL HERE. MAKE A CIRCLE FORWARD A LITTLE BIT. DEEP COLOR, NEUTRAL... GOT HIM, COME HERE! TRAVIS BROWN: RIGHT BEHIND YA, RIGHT BEHIND YA. GET HIM TIED UP. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WHOO-HOO, GOT HIS ASS, DUDE! TRAVIS BROWN: GOOD NIGHT. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: IT'S BEEN LONG ENOUGH, MAN. HAD TO WORK FOR THIS ONE. THANK GOD, DUDE. OURS NOW. TRAVIS BROWN: GREAT WORK, MAN. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: GOOD JOB, BROTHER. VERY NICE TO HAVE THAT FISH. TRAVIS AND I WORKED HARD. THE FISH ALMOST BEAT US A COUPLE DIFFERENT TIMES AND HEY, CAPTAIN PINWHEEL PUT HIM TO SCHOOL. TJ OTT: I'D LIKE TO GET SOME BITES HERE, MAN. IF THERE'S NOT A BITE HERE BY NOON, I HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING THERE WILL BE A BITE IN THE LATE AFTERNOON. DAVE CARRARO: YEAH, BUT WE GOT TO STAY, WE CAME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE WE GOT TO MAKE IT WORK. WE'RE GONNA STICK AND STAY. [REEL UNSPOOLING RAPIDLY]. TIM OTT: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! WE'RE ON, HOLD THIS, TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS! TAKE THIS (BLEEP) FROM ME. MIKE OTT: HOLD ON! SANDRO MANIACI: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! DAVE CARRARO: GET HIM, GET HIM, GET HIM! TIM OTT: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! WE'RE ON, HOLD THIS, TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS! TAKE THIS (BLEEP) FROM ME. MIKE OTT: HOLD ON! TJ OTT: GO, GO, GO! TIM OTT: SEEMS LIKE HE'S A BLUEFIN, GOOD CHARGE ON THE FIRST RUN. TJ OTT: FINALLY, IT LOOKS LIKE A BIG ONE. THIS IS WHY WE'RE OUT HERE IN GEORGES. SOMEONE'S LOOKING OUT FOR US, MAN. THANK YOU! TIM OTT: NOW WE GOT A LITTLE BATTLE AHEAD OF US, AND HERE WE GO! GO MAMA, GO! SANDRO MANIACI: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! DAVE CARRARO: GET HIM, GET HIM, GET HIM! GEORDIE SOUSA: WANT TO GET OFF? DAVE CARRARO: NOT YET. SANDRO MANIACI: I JUST PUT THIS WHITING OUT. I JUST PUT IT OUT. WE GOT DOWN AND TIGHT. GOOD WAY TO START THE DAY THERE. THIS IS A REALLY GOOD SIGN THAT WE'RE HOOKED UP RIGHT NOW. IT MEANS THAT THE BITE IS STILL ON OUT HERE. I HOPE THAT WE CAN PUT THEM ON DECK. GO FORWARD, GO FORWARD, GO FORWARD. DAVE CARRARO: I GOT THE ANCHOR, THE ANCHOR'S, YEAH. SANDRO MANIACI: GO FORWARD. MIKE OTT: I THINK IT'S A BLUEFIN, TJ. TIM OTT: YEAH, I THINK SO. HE'S GOT ALL THE RIGHT QUALITIES OF BEING A NICE BLUEFIN TUNA FISH. WE'RE PSYCHED MAN. I GOT IT, I GOT IT. GET A GLOVE ON, LET'S GO. READY? JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: READY, LET HIM IN. TIM OTT: YES, THIS IS WHAT WE CAME FOR, BOYS! BIG, BIG BITE ON THE HOT TUNA, MAN, WE'RE PSYCHED! SANDRO MANIACI: THE FISH CRUSHED THIS, DUDE. DAVE CARRARO: WOW, YEAH, YEAH. SANDRO MANIACI: SO YOU DECIDED TO MARK THEM, THEY'RE EATING? DAVE CARRARO: YEAH, THEY'RE EATING, MAN. SANDRO MANIACI: BIG BOY. DAVE CARRARO: LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN TODAY, BOYS. WE GOTTA, WE'RE JUST BARELY AHEAD OF MARCIANO RIGHT NOW. AND I DIDN'T COME ALL THE WAY OUT HERE TO GIVE UP THAT LEAD, SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BITE AND PUT THIS FISH ON ICE. LET THE HOOK WORK ITS WAY IN. WE'RE ON AGAIN. IT'S AMAZING. A LOT OF FISH HERE. TJ OTT: GOT HIM ON, BABY! THE REEL IS TURNING AND WE'RE TRYING TO SLOW HIM DOWN, BABY. WHOO! HE'S TAKING A LOT OF LINE. IT'S GOT THE DACRON WAY OUT. TIM OTT: IT'S A BIG ONE, BABY! JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: EITHER A GOOD-SIZED FISH, HE TOOK A HELL OF A LOT OF LINE OUT. TIM OTT: GOT A GOOD BATTLE AHEAD OF US, YOU KNOW? JARRETT'S GOT A LOT OF LINE BACK, BUT IT'S FAR FROM OVER. DAVE CARRARO: HE'S GOING DOWN, HE'S GOING DOWN. GEORDIE, GET ON THE CONTROLS FOR A MINUTE? SANDRO MANIACI: OKAY, NEUTRAL. GEORDIE SOUSA: YOU WANT ME TO SQUARE YOU UP, LET ME KNOW. SANDRO MANIACI: PLEASE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WILD AND CRAZY FISH HERE. DAVE CARRARO: NO WAY. ARE YOU (BLEEP) SERIOUS? NO (BLEEP) WAY. SANDRO MANIACI: UN (BLEEP) REAL. WOW... I JUST DON'T GET IT. I REALLY DON'T. TJ OTT: THIS FISH IS FAR FROM TIRED; HE'S STILL TAKING SMOKING RUNS. THIS FISH IS DEFINITELY A HUNDRED INCHES PLUS. TIM OTT: ALL RIGHT? JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: YOU WANT TO JUMP ON HERE? TIM OTT: WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: ALL RIGHT, READY. TJ OTT: OH! IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER, IT'S OVER. TIM OTT: AW, MAN! TJ OTT: WE SHOULD'VE KEPT HIM ON THERE. I HATE DOING THAT. (BLEEP) MOST LIKELY PULLED A HOOK. FISH CHARGED THE BOAT ON THE BITE. TIM OTT: PULLED THE HOOK. PULLED THE HOOK. TJ OTT: (BLEEP), (BLEEP), (BLEEP). IT'S TOO MUCH. TIM OTT: YOU CAN SEE THE BEND IN HERE, SO THAT MEANS THAT'S HOW FAR IT WAS IN HIS MOUTH, SO THAT MEANS IT WAS RIGHT DOWN IN HIS GUTS. UNBELIEVABLE. PAUL HERBERT: LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND. THIS PLACE LOOKS GOOD. WE'RE JUST STARTING, MAN. THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT THERE'S A BIG BITE GOING ON AT GEORGES RIGHT NOW. I GOT YOUR BAG. BUT AS THE CAPTAIN AND OWNER OF THE BOAT. I HAVE TO DECIDE WHERE WE HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF PUTTING MONEY IN OUR POCKETS. LANCE SISTARE: THIS IS NOT GOING IN A GOOD DIRECTION, PAUL. PAUL HERBERT: LANCE SEEMED TO THINK HE WAS THE EXPERT TUNA FISHERMAN OF THE WORLD. MY (BLEEP) BOAT, YOU HEAR ME? DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT ON MY BOAT. IT'S NOT WORKING OUT RIGHT NOW. I'M GONNA HAVE TO LET YOU GO, LANCE. SO NOW IT'S JUST BRAD AND ME. WE'RE JUST GONNA CONTINUE FISHING IN SHORE JUST LIKE WE DID LAST WEEK. LET'S HOPE THAT I CAN MAKE A PAYCHECK RIGHT HERE. BRAD KRASOWSKI: WE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL. YOU KNOW, WE COULD USE ANOTHER HAND, BUT HERE WE ARE. [BEEPING] OH, MY GOD. OH. PAUL HERBERT: WOW! HE'S GONNA TAKE IT. COME ON, TAKE THE BAIT. THERE HE IS, WE'RE ON, COME ON! FORWARD TO THE RIGHT! WAIT A MINUTE, HOLD, NEUTRAL! LET'S GO, BRAD! REEL THIS SUCKER IN. BRAD KRASOWSKI: ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT! JUST MAKING IT CIRCLE AROUND. THERE IT IS, RIGHT HERE! WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET IT. PAUL HERBERT: I SEE. BRAD KRASOWSKI: I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS THAT CLOSE. PAUL HERBERT: DON'T BE HASTY. LET'S WAIT FOR THE SHOT. BRAD KRASOWSKI: I'M NOT. JUST KEEP EASING HIM AROUND LIKE THIS. PAUL HERBERT: DON'T BE HASTY. BRAD KRASOWSKI: YOU KEEP BUMPING ALONG, I'LL BE ABLE TO EASE HIM RIGHT UP. PAUL HERBERT: YOU GOT IT. PAUL HERBERT: GET HIM RIGHT UP THERE. THERE YOU GO. JAB HIM, HIT THE HEAD! NAIL HIM! PAUL HERBERT: DON'T BE HASTY. LET'S WAIT FOR THE SHOT. BRAD KRASOWSKI: I'M NOT, JUST KEEP EASING HIM AROUND LIKE THIS. PAUL HERBERT: DON'T BE HASTY. BRAD KRASOWSKI: YOU KEEP BUMPING IT ALONG, I'LL BE ABLE TO EASE HIM RIGHT UP. PAUL HERBERT: YOU GOT IT. WE GOT A REALLY GOOD FISH ON THE LINE. PAUL HERBERT: IT'S REALLY, REALLY ROUGH AND IT'S ONLY BRAD AND I SO WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS AND REALLY STAY IN SYNC. GET HIM RIGHT UP THERE. THERE YOU GO. JAB HIM. HIT THE HEAD. THERE YOU GO. WAY TO GO, BRAD. ATTA BOY, BRAD. BRAD KRASOWSKI: WHOO! YEAH BOY. PAUL HERBERT: PAYDAY, BABY. BRAD KRASOWSKI: CATCHING UP. TO COME OUT HERE PUT MORE MONEY IN OUR POCKETS, WE CAN MOVE ON FROM THE DRAMA OF LANCE. WE'RE COMING BACK. PAUL HERBERT: WE'RE CATCHING UP. BRAD KRASOWSKI: WE'RE COMING FOR YA. IT FEELS GOOD, RIGHT? WE'RE GONNA GO GET ANOTHER COUPLE MORE. WE NEED A COUPLE MORE OF THESE BOOSTS. PAUL HERBERT: WE'RE GONNA GET FOUR FISH. WATCH. GUARANTEED WE'RE GONNA GET FOUR. BRAD KRASOWSKI: WE'LL TAKE 'EM. DAVE MARCIANO: HEY, TJ, ARE YOU THERE? TJ OTT: YEAH, AY-YAI-YAI. THIS IS SOMETHING. I'M NOT FEELING GOOD ABOUT THIS, BRO. SO FAR NOTHING HAS GONE OUR WAY. WE BOTH PULLED HOOKS ON FISH AND EVER SINCE IT'S BEEN DEAD. IF SOMETHING DOESN'T HAPPEN SOON, ULTIMATELY, IT'S GONNA ALL FALL ON ME. OH BOY. ALL RIGHT, WELL ONE, SOMEONE WILL GET ONE HERE, SOMEONE WILL WIN THE LOTTERY HERE TODAY. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! SOMETHING'S ON FIRE! SOMETHING'S ON FIRE! TIM OTT: WHAT? TJ OTT: SOMETHING'S ON FIRE! TIM OTT: WHERE? TJ OTT: I DON'T KNOW! I SMELL IT. I SMELL ELECTRICAL BURN. TIM OTT: I SMELL IT TOO. TJ OTT: WHERE'S IT COMING FROM? TIM OTT: I DON'T KNOW! TJ OTT: OVER HERE LOOK! SEE WHERE IT'S RISING RIGHT THERE, LOOK! TIM OTT: SHUT THE GENERATOR OFF, YOU'RE LOSING POWER. TJ OTT: I THINK IT'S THE PANEL. YEAH, I FEEL WARMTH. IT'S IN HERE. TIM OTT: IT'S GOTTA BE BEHIND IT. TJ OTT: I SAW SMOKE RISING FROM THIS PANEL. I'VE KNOWN BOATS WITH EXTREMELY KNOWLEDGEABLE CAPTAINS HAVE FIRES ON BOARD AND GO DOWN IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. TIM OTT: MICHAEL, GET SCREWDRIVERS. TJ OTT: SQUARE HEAD'S FINE! GIMME SQUARE HEADS. MIKE OTT: WE GOTTA FIND IT! TJ OTT: SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE LOCATE THE SOURCE OF THIS FIRE. IT'S IN THAT BAG! THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THEM. TIM OTT: THIS IS PRETTY PATHETIC THAT WE CAN'T FIND A SQUARE HEAD. TJ OTT: I'LL RIP THE (BLEEP) OFF, IF I GOTTA. TIM OTT: IT'S STILL COMING UP THERE. MIKE OTT: TRY THAT. TJ OTT: THIS IS WARM, I'M JUST GONNA OPEN THIS NOW, AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME KIND OF WIRE BURNING INSIDE HERE. THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE. TIM OTT: WHAT IS IT? TJ OTT: HOLY (BLEEP). THE WIRE OVER HERE. RIGHT THERE LOOK. HOLY (BLEEP). TIM OTT: HOW BAD? TJ OTT: YEAH, IF I DIDN'T SMELL IT, WE WOULD'VE BEEN ON FIRE. I'LL LET YOU LOOK AT IT HERE. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: IT'S A HELL OF A WAY TO WAKE UP, MAN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. TIM OTT: OH, WAIT A MINUTE. TJ OTT: WHAT? TIM OTT: IT'S THE FEED! TJ OTT: THAT'S THE HOT IN RIGHT? TIM OTT: THE BLOCK MELTED. THE WIRE DIDN'T MELT. SEE THAT? TJ OTT: IT'S THAT LITTLE JUNCTION THING THERE. TIM OTT: THAT LITTLE BOX MELTED, YEAH. TJ OTT: THE JUNCTION BOX WHICH CONNECTS THE POWER COMING OUT OF THE GENERATOR TO THE PANEL STARTED TO MELT BECAUSE OF A LOOSE CONNECTION. IF I HADN'T SMELLED IT AND SPOTTED IT WHEN I DID, IT EVENTUALLY WOULD HAVE LIT ON FIRE AND LEFT US OUT HERE 150 MILES FROM SHORE WITH NO POWER. TIM OTT: JUST OVER TIME, IT'S FATIGUED. TJ OTT: WHAT DO WE DO? TIM OTT: I GOTTA GO IN. WE GOTTA HAVE A GENERATOR. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. TJ OTT: OH, MAN. TIM OTT: WE GOTTA GO IN. WE GOT TOO MANY VARIABLES. TIM OTT: LET'S GO. PULL THE ANCHOR. TJ OTT: I'M NOT REALLY A MASTER ELECTRICIAN. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON OVER THERE SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO IN, WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAUSED IT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DIAGNOSE IT PROPERLY AND IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN, YOU KNOW? WE'VE GOT A LOT OF FISHING TO DO AND THAT COULD BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH. ANOTHER MINUTE OR TWO AND THAT COULD HAVE GOTTEN REALLY, REALLY BAD. SO I, I THINK WE DEFINITELY JUST DODGED A MAJOR BULLET. ALL RIGHT LET JUST ME GET THE MOTOR GOING. DAVE MARCIANO: WHAT'S HE'S DOING? TJ OTT: WE'RE OUT OF HERE! DAVE MARCIANO: WHAT HAPPENED? TJ OTT: WE ALMOST WENT ON FIRE. SANDRO MANIACI: WHAT? DAVE MARCIANO: HOW? TJ OTT: WHEN I WAS TALKING TO YOU, I SMELLED SOMETHING AND I SAW SMOKE COMING UP BEHIND ME FROM THE PANEL. DAVE MARCIANO: THE ELECTRICAL? TJ OTT: YEAH, WIRE WAS MELTING INSIDE THE PANEL. NOT GOOD MAN. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD. DAVE CARRARO: GO GET IT FIXED. TJ OTT: ALL RIGHT, MAN, GOOD LUCK. DAVE MARCIANO: THAT'S SCARY, MAN. YOU GET STUCK IN A FIRE IN A BOAT, THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO. TJ OTT: IT SUCKS THAT WE'RE COMING HOME WITHOUT FISH. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE ALL STILL HERE, WE'RE ALL ALIVE. IT COULD'VE BEEN A LOT WORSE. [BEEPING] PAUL HERBERT: THERE'S ANOTHER MARK. A LOT OF THEM HERE. BRAD KRASOWSKI: THERE HE IS. PAUL HERBERT: THERE HE IS. HE'S RIGHT ON IT. TWO OF THEM. BRAD KRASOWSKI: AH, HE'S GOTTA EAT IT. PAUL HERBERT: BRAD AND I CAUGHT A NICE FISH. WE'RE SEEING MORE FISH ON THE SCREEN NOW. LET'S DO THIS. BRAD KRASOWSKI: LET'S THROW SOME CHUM. PAUL HERBERT: THESE ARE BIG CHUM FISH. THEY'RE ALL OVER IT, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? [REEL UNSPOOLING RAPIDLY] BRAD KRASOWSKI: OH, WE GOT SOMETHING ON HERE. PAUL HERBERT: HERE WE GO, WE'RE ON. IT'S GOOD, RIGHT, BRAD? BRAD KRASOWSKI: THIS IS A TUNA. WE'RE HOOKED UP. PAUL HERBERT: WHAT DO YOU GOT? BRAD KRASOWSKI: I THINK IT'S GOT ENOUGH WEIGHT TO BE LIKE A 75-INCHER, YOU KNOW? I GOT COLOR. GET THE HARPOON READY. STICK HIM, HE'S RIGHT THERE. PAUL HERBERT: NAILED HIM. BRAD KRASOWSKI: WHERE'S THE GAFF, BRO, UP IN THE CABIN? PAUL HERBERT: RIGHT ON THE GUNNEL THERE. YOU GOT IT? BRAD KRASOWSKI: YEAH, I GOT IT. THESE AIN'T MONSTER GIANTS, BUT WE'LL TAKE 'EM. OH. PAUL HERBERT: GOT HIM. BRAD KRASOWSKI: WE GOT TWO FOR TWO, SO FAR. WE'RE NOT DOING BAD. PAUL HERBERT: AH YEAH! GEORDIE SOUSA: UGH. THIS IS A TRAVESTY. DAVE CARRARO: I TELL YOU MAN, I FEEL LIKE I AM SO OVER THIS. GEORDIE SOUSA: THIS IS A JOKE SHOW. DAVE CARRARO: SEEING HOT TUNA GO HOME DOESN'T GIVE ME A LOT OF CONFIDENCE AND WITH JUST ONE PULLED HOOK THIS WEEK. GEORGES BANK IS NOW LOOKING LIKE A BIG MISTAKE. WE JUST CAN'T CATCH WHAT'S NOT HERE. SIMPLY THERE'S NO FISH HERE. THIS ISN'T FISHING THIS IS WISHING. [REEL UNSPOOLING RAPIDLY] SANDRO MANIACI: WE'RE ON, WE'RE ON! DAVE CARRARO: GET THE ROD IN. GEORDIE SOUSA: YUP! SANDRO MANIACI: EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY, EASY. SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN. DAVE CARRARO: WE'RE HOOKED UP. I TAKE BACK EVERYTHING I SAID. GEORDIE SOUSA: THIS IS GONNA BE SLOPPY. [LAUGHING] DAVE MARCIANO: KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING. SANDRO MANIACI: HOLD ON, WATCH OUT. DAVE CARRARO: WE'RE JUST ECSTATIC TO HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO LAND A FISH. BUT RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO SETTLE DOWN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKES THAT COST US THAT LAST FISH. GEORDIE SOUSA: OKAY, GO AHEAD, READY COMING IN. SANDRO MANIACI: OH. I'M SO COLD AND WET RIGHT NOW. GEORDIE SOUSA: YUP. HE'S THERE, HE'S THERE. READY? OH, HE'S RIGHT HERE BUDDY. SANDRO MANIACI: YEAH, I SEE IT, I SEE IT. WOW, LOOK AT HIM GO. THAT THING IS NUTS!

DAVE MARCIANO: THERE HE GOES. HE'S RUNNING, HE'S GOING! SANDRO MANIACI: THIS FISH IS ABSOLUTELY, INSANE! LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN. SOON HE'S GONNA BE COMING OUT OF THE WATER MIGHT AS WELL AT THIS POINT. GEORDIE SOUSA: JESUS. SANDRO MANIACI: GONNA TRY AND GET THIS FISH BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOWN, MAKES A LOT EASIER TO HARPOON. IF IT GETS DARK, IT MAKES THAT MUCH HARDER. DAVE MARCIANO: COME ON SANDRO.

IT FEELS SO GOOD RIGHT NOW TO HAVE THIS FISH ON DECK. I WAS TRULY STARTING TO GET WORRIED THAT WE WERE GOING TO HEAD HOME EMPTY HANDED. OH, MAN. GOOD JOB, GUYS. PAUL HERBERT: YOU GOT ROOM? BRAD KRASOWSKI: YUP. PAUL HERBERT: ALL RIGHT, LIFT UP. BRAD KRASOWSKI: HOLD ON. GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD. PAUL HERBERT: THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

TRAVIS BROWN: LET'S SEE WHAT THIS THING MEASURES, 93. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: BINGO. TRAVIS BROWN: STOKED TO HAVE IT, MAN. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: DUDE, I'M GLAD TO HAVE IT, MAN. I STARTED TO FORGET WHAT THESE THINGS LOOK LIKE. WE COULDN'T CATCH ONE. TRAVIS BROWN: PHEW. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: THAT'S A NICE $4,500 PAYDAY RIGHT THERE, ALL DAY. TRAVIS BROWN: ONE WAY TICKET TO JAPAN. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: WE'RE CLOSE TO SHORE. SO RATHER THAN TAKE OUR CHANCES ON CATCHING A SECOND FISH, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE QUICK TRIP TO THE BUYER AND MAKE SURE WE CAN GET THE BEST PRICE WE CAN GET. TRAVIS BROWN: LET'S SEE IF WE GET PAID WHAT IT'S WORTH. GET THIS FISH PUT ON ICE. GO HARD AT IT. GUT: HOW'D YOU DO THIS TRIP, TYLER? TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: YEAH, I GOT ONE FISH FOR YOU. GUT: ALL SET?

WHEN A BUYER LOOKS AT THE FISH, HE'S LOOKING AT THE FAT CONTENT, THE COLOR, THE OIL, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE CORE SAMPLE. IF ALL THESE VARIABLES ARE OF GOOD QUALITY. WE'RE GONNA GET A GOOD PRICE FOR THIS FISH. GUT: THAT'S A NICE LOOKING FISH RIGHT THERE. COLOR'S NICE. GOOD FAT. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: HERRING EATER, BABY. GUT: YEAH, LET'S TAKE A CORE, SEE WHAT WE GOT.

THIS FISH IS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, BUT WE CAN'T STOP NOW. WE'RE GOING RIGHT BACK OUT CAUSE I GOT A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO. AND IF THAT MEANS DRIVING TRAVIS INTO THE GROUND.
