 PAUL HEBERT: We're gonna lose this fish! Look out! Look out! Gaff! NARRATOR: Catching. LANCE SISTARE: Oh! JASON MUENZNER: Forward! SANDRO MANIACI: Hey! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: [Inaudible]! Oh God! NARRATOR: Wicked Tuna. At the start of week two, Maine father daughter operation Erin and Sarah leads the fleet, while last season's champion, Hard Merchandise, trails behind the pack with no fish. DAVE MARCIANO: Oh, yeah. That's the problem. Yeah, night-biting tuna. JASON MUENZNER: You know. DAVE MARCIANO: Ah. Last year, we caught more Bluefin than any other boat, and finished at the top of the fleet. But then we went fishing down south in North Carolina and we didn't catch a single keeper tuna. JASON MUENZNER: Now what? DAVE MARCIANO: All we gotta do is wait. I'm starting to get a little bit frustrated. All the other boats have caught fish. There's no way I wanna end this second week in a row with zero fish. JASON MUENZNER: You wanna make some popcorn? DAVE MARCIANO: Yeah. Let's make some popcorn, Jay. Popcorn for the movie we're watching. The title tonight is Blue Screen of Death. JASON MUENZNER: I wonder how Dot Com's doing over there. GEORDIE SOUSA: There he is. Forty feet. DAVE CARRARO: Is he, really? Oh, yeah, look at that. Geez. He's right inside, too. Wow. Last week, we were up north fishing in Maine, but this week the fish are being spotted on Jeffreys Ledge, which is less than 10 miles away from Gloucester. I always prefer fishing closer to home, and this week, I plan on getting better quality fish than the two we caught up in Maine. We're on the warpath and we are gonna be that number one boat. Look at the tunas! Look at the tunas here! Look! Oh, no! They're eating, they're eating chunks! It's right there. It was eating. Throw some chum. He's right there. He swam right around the back of the boat. There he is! Look at, look at the size of him! Look at the, he's right there, he's right there. SANDRO MANIACI: Come on. DAVE CARRARO: Yeah. It's huge. Pull this rod up. We'll hook him on this rod. SANDRO MANIACI: Oh, look at that! GEORDIE SOUSA: There he is. SANDRO MANIACI: There he is. DAVE CARRARO: Is this a Thresher or tuna? SANDRO MANIACI: It's a tuna. It's a thousand pounds, Dave. Relax. DAVE CARRARO: I'm not relaxing. Right over here. He's a thousand-pounder. There he is! Look! SANDRO MANIACI: Is that a, fish or a [inaudible]. DAVE CARRARO: It's a tuna, I'm telling you! There he is, there he is. SANDRO MANIACI: There he is. DAVE CARRARO: Re-spool it. He's got it, he's got it! He's got it! He's got it! Lock it up, lock it up! He's there. Yeah, man! No freaking way. There we go. GEORDIE SOUSA: Ready? DAVE CARRARO: Yeah, guys, good. Wow! Right out of my [bleep] hand. Whoa! DAVE CARRARO: Clear, Geordie? SANDRO MANIACI: Yeah, we're off the hook. DAVE CARRARO: He's coming at you, he's coming at you. He's there, he's there. He's still there. He's there. Nice! Woo-hoo! Nothing better than hand-feeding a fish. Wow! Ooh! DAVE CARRARO: Oh, yeah, he's big. Now that's fishing right there. DAVE MARCIANO: Can't catch a break! Seeing Dave hook up right beside me just pushes me a little bit harder. That guy's the luckiest fisherman I know, sometimes. DAVE CARRARO: I'm as nervous as can be right now. SANDRO MANIACI: I can't feel my arms, anymore. Feels great. That's what it's all about. I'm not giving up. DAVE CARRARO: He's coming up for sure, now. He's on top! There he is! GEORDIE SOUSA: Color. DAVE CARRARO: Swivel! Here he is! SANDRO MANIACI: Get a tail rope ready. DAVE CARRARO: We can gaff him. Here he is. Gaff, gaff, gaff! Come here. SANDRO MANIACI: I got it, I got this. Get this. GEORDIE SOUSA: It's coming. DAVE CARRARO: Left, left, left, left. GEORDIE SOUSA: Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho! Got one! SANDRO MANIACI: Yay! GEORDIE SOUSA: What the! DAVE CARRARO: Oh, man! GEORDIE SOUSA: Oh my God, dude! SANDRO MANIACI: Nice. DAVE CARRARO: Nice work, boys. Guys, look on the tail on that. GEORDIE SOUSA: Fearless! SANDRO MANIACI: Ooh, sweet! GEORDIE SOUSA: About four inches wider than my shoulders on either side. DAVE CARRARO: Oh, my God! Oh, my God. I'll call Marciano. Dave, come in. Hey, Dave, pick it up. DAVE MARCIANO: Yeah. You there? Go ahead. DAVE CARRARO: Totally, totally epic right now. You wouldn't believe what happened. DAVE MARCIANO: What happened? DAVE CARRARO: This big, freaking 900-pounder comes out and just inhales the dead herring I threw in the water. I didn't even harpoon him. Just put a gaff on his tail and put a rope on him. DAVE MARCIANO: Yeah, that's good. Good going. PETE SPEECHES: What a lucky bastard. I prefer to fish around Maine near my home, but I'm glad I came down to Mass this week. There's fish here to catch. Our goal is to stay the number one boat. The Erin and Sarah can catch fish wherever we go. I'm fishing with this Gloucester fleet to prove I can fish against anybody. I don't have to be in Maine to catch fish. DAVE MARCIANO: We pulled a bunch off these numbers last year, but DAVE CARRARO: All right, stick it out, Dave. They're here. You'll get them. DAVE MARCIANO: And now, so Dave just gets a gift. [Bleep] 900-pounder comes up and eats the ones he's cleaning out of the live well. And, uh, we can't catch the [bleep] clap in a whorehouse with a fistful of fifties tonight. DAVE CARRARO: Got it? SANDRO AND GEORDIE: Yeah! SANDRO MANIACI: Come on in! In. GEORDIE SOUSA: Wait, watch it. DAVE CARRARO: He's a porker. Beautiful fish. Let's see how many inches he is. SANDRO MANIACI: 109. Done! DAVE CARRARO: That's, that's amazing. Now let's go get another one. TJ OTT: Talk about lucky! DAVE MARCIANO: Damn near thousand-pounder just started slurping them off the surface. TJ OTT: That is just, come on! DAVE MARCIANO: We'll talk to you later, man. TJ OTT: All right, Dave. Good luck. Can you believe that? Like, What is that, Sandro? Oh, God, look! It's a thousand-pounder! So Marciano tells me about this lucky catch that Dirtbag Dot Com had last night. I'm definitely a little pissed. It's the start of Week Two. He's already got three fish and we've only got one. Tyler. Dude, you gotta hear this. Marciano said that Dot Com was chucking dead herring over, and there was a thousand-pounder eating the dead herring. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Oh, my God! TJ OTT: Maybe one of us will get lucky like that Prick. Unbelievable. [LAUGHTER] Last season, we put him on the meat. We made him some money, and he definitely didn't return the favor. How many did you get? DAVE CARRARO: Three. TJ OTT: Did you break your fingers fighting them all? You couldn't dial the phone? He ended up with a boatload of fish, and we went home empty-handed. That definitely burned us, and it's hard to get over it. DAVE CARRARO: From the way TJ's talking to Tyler, I think he's still way upset about last season. It's not good for our friendship and it's certainly not good for my fishing. And the only way we're gonna fix that is we're gonna need to talk about it. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ PAUL HEBERT: Yeah, baby. She's running, she's running! It feels really good to be on my own boat. My name's Paul Hebert, and I'm the captain of the Wicked Pissah. God, that sounds good! This season's the first year that I'm captaining a boat that I own! But, I'm 40 grand in the hole. I gotta make 80 grand. It's what I've been working for my whole life. My whole life, I've been working for this. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ I'm here this year to stop all the lip-smack from all them guys. He'll never buy a boat. He'll never, blah, blah, blah. He'll never succeed. I'm here to prove them all wrong. And I'm gonna out-fish them all. Every one of them. The new boat has a new crew. And they're the best crew you could find. Brad is one of the best fishermen around. I used to fish with him a long time ago. Lance knows every nut and bolt on this boat and he helped me do a lot of the work on this boat. We're gonna catch a lot of tuna this year, a lot! Here we go. I know I got a bad reputation when it comes to keeping a crew. All right! LANCE SISTARE: Wash off your wee-wee, baby. It's time to go to work. PAUL HEBERT: Hey, buddy! Let's do it. Pumped! LANCE SISTARE: It's time to go fishing! PAUL HEBERT: Ow! I'm pumped! But I'm gonna prove I can keep a crew happy. LANCE SISTARE: Okay, Cap. PAUL HEBERT: Profitable, and loyal. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Time for some blood, baby. PAUL HEBERT: Lots of blood, baby. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Blood on the deck. Lots of blood. LANCE SISTARE: Gonna paint the deck red. PAUL HEBERT: We may be the littlest boat on the fleet, but we're gonna be on top. LANCE SISTARE: I feel bad for the rest of the fleet. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: What's going on with our little anchor problem here? Maybe we sucked it in. Sometimes when the boat's drifting around, the lines go underneath the boat, the rope floats around and gets entangled in the propeller or the rudder. And when that happens, you can't maneuver your boat, because you could break something. Someone is definitely going swimming. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Drake's volunteered to dive in. He's being a solid mate, thank God! The water is 70 degrees, though. I'd kind of be excited to jump in, but I'd be awfully scared about all the sharks that are swimming around. Imagine if he got bit by a shark while diving under the boat? That that, I mean, am I liable for that? I don't know. I like your little swimming costume. It's really nice. You kind of look like a seal. DRAKE ROY: There's always a risk of sharks when you're that far offshore. So, you know, that is always a real thought in my head. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: All right, brother. Let's be safe, be careful. Thanks, brother. DRAKE ROY: Yeah. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Be careful. Diving under a boat is nothing safe about it. You're dealing with a very sharp knife, so it's very important you make precision cuts, and you pay attention to what you're doing. The other thing is the boat can be rocking and rolling, and you don't wanna get your head hit, because it can cause a concussion and knock you out. It's scary, it's dangerous. People have lost fingers doing this. Yeah! That's my boy, Drake! Getting it done. Drake did it. He didn't crack his head open. He didn't slice his fingers off. Now we're ready to catch some tunas. Great job getting in there, brother. DRAKE ROY: Yeah, man. No worries. Getting the line out of that wheel was definitely my duty as the mate, and if I couldn't do that, I'm sure Tyler would be disappointed in me. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Thanks for taking one for the team, man. I'm so glad I didn't have to get wet. DRAKE ROY: No worries, no worries. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: I'm confident that this season, together, we're gonna be a force to be reckoned with. Dude, at least we can move now and fight a fish. DRAKE ROY: Oh, yeah. LANCE SISTARE: Chum and they will come. PAUL HEBERT: With Lance, Brad and I, we are gonna catch a ton of tuna fish this year. I've known Paul for about two and a half years. He's a great guy, he's a great fisherman. The reason why I'm fishing is to provide for my family. My daughter's name is Scarlett Ann and she's five years old. If we don't catch any fish, my daughter's gonna be the one that suffers here, and I just don't wanna let my daughter down. Just gonna keep chumming, keep grinding, man. That's all. BRAD KRASOWSKI: This is a great spot right here. It's got the colder water. It's got plenty of bait. It's got plenty of fish. It's the perfect area. I'm fishing for my family. My 15-year old son Brad, my 17-year old daughter Emma, they've endured the sacrifices their entire life since they were tiny children. They probably ate more fish than any kids alive and if it wasn't for my wife Heather, I'd be dead, long gone, just dead. She's the rock solid beautiful lady of my life. To go out and provide for your family, you have to be out there. PAUL HEBERT: There he is. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Tuna under the boat. PAUL HEBERT: That's 'cause we're chumming. We're on, we're on! Lance! Reel, reel, reel! Here we go. All right. We're on. LANCE SISTARE: First tuna bite this season. It's game on, baby! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ PAUL HEBERT: We're on! Lance, reel. Reel, reel! Oh, here we go. LANCE SISTARE: First tuna bite this season. It's game on, baby! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Let him run, let him run. Let him run! That's what we want him to do. We wanna go in the deep water. PAUL HEBERT: Lance, just keep him a little tight, all right? Just reel your balls off. That's all, okay? That's it. LANCE SISTARE: Feels good, man. We have a fish on. Feels real good. He's takin' line, right now. This hopefully is a big fish. This could be a thousand-pound fish worth over 20 grand! Going nice and easy with this fish. I'm almost up to the mono. It's good. I'm getting a little back on him. PAUL HEBERT: I'd like to put him in the middle, kind of. LANCE SISTARE: Brad's got a good handle on my rod, and Paul's driving the boat. And we're, we're, we're excited. It's. PAUL HEBERT: Oh, he's gone! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Oh! LANCE SISTARE: There you go. PAUL HEBERT: Back to the anchor. BRAD KRASOWSKI: It's not right. PAUL HEBERT: Pulled the hook. LANCE SISTARE: It pulled the hook. Just like that. BRAD KRASOWSKI: There's no other job where you can lose your paycheck so fast in a split second. And it's tough on your soul, it's tough on your psyche. I'm just gonna get the baits back out and try again. PAUL HEBERT: That's called tuna fishing, brother. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Painful. PAUL HEBERT: Nothing you can do about that. We'll go get another bite. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ ERIN SPEECHES: Oh! That was beautiful. PETE SPEECHES: Money shot. Got a couple of whales milling around. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ ERIN SPEECHES: Whales are a good sign. It means they're around, eating the bait, which is the same stuff that the tuna eats. So fingers crossed that there's some tuna in the midst. PETE SPEECHES: Let's hope the, uh, nighttime brings a few more herring and a few more fish. The Erin and Sarah is usually fishing out of Portland, Maine, but we came down to Massachusetts this week to fish Southern Jeffrey's. It was the right decision. All the signs are here. I plan on keeping our lead even against the Gloucester fleet. BRANDON PIERCE: Good day for a tan. I don't know if it's a good day, a good day for fishing or not, but. PETE SPEECHES: There's no bad day to go fishing. Just some days are better than others. BRANDON PIERCE: Can't argue that. PETE SPEECHES: One of my grandfather's sayings. BRANDON PIERCE: Pete had a rough go of it when he was a kid. I know he lost both his parents at a real young age, and he kind of had to fend for himself. And I think that's developed him into the, uh, hardworking fisherman that he is today. PETE SPEECHES: All right. It's time for a fish. Time for a fish BRANDON PIERCE: I can relate, too. When I was 14 years old, my father passed away. That's kind of the age where you, you need your father the most. So, so it was a tough time. I was real close with my father. I mean, we did everything together. Basically ever since I could walk, I'd fished with my father quite a bit, and kind of took to fishing as a way to, uh, you know, heal myself. PETE SPEECHES: There he is, flopping around. Checking things out. ERIN SPEECHES: Aw! PETE SPEECHES: Remember, every seabird is a lost sailor's soul, they say. ERIN SPEECHES: Are there any other superstitions I should know about? PETE SPEECHES: No bananas on the boat. Because the banana boats were always an unlucky craft that carried spiders and disease. Never whistle on a boat, it brings wind. There's all kinds of superstitions. No women on a boat. Women are unlucky on a boat. But, I don't know them all and we only subscribe to a few of them. [LAUGHTER] TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Aw, nice mark, dude! We're on. It's a big one! Got him on, dude! Got him on. Get me out the ball reel on that one. This is the real deal. We've been waiting all day for this. Night bite, dude, out of nowhere, really happy to have it on. Go to work. DRAKE ROY: Yes, sir. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Thank God that Drake freed us from the anchor line earlier, or we wouldn't be able to chase this fish down. Get him, get him, get him! Get some, baby, get some! Nice workout. We're just chasing him down, trying to close the gap, get a little closer to them. It's got a lot of line out, right now. There's a lot of play in that hook. You don't wanna pull a hook, here. He's up on top, changing directions. Just wanna kind of close the deal, here. DRAKE ROY: Oh, this feels like a nice fish, here. It's definitely a real one. Nice hundred-incher. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Good job, Drake. You're killing it. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Big boy, big boy, big boy, big boy, big boy. DRAKE ROY: Whoa! There's no describing that. The way your abs feel like when you're cranking that thing in. Ty, turn me! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Dude, I'm stressed out, man. You know, the other boats are catching fish. We gotta start making money. Big headshakes, oh, God! That's so scary, man. The fish is banging his head, smashing his head. Big, violent headshakes. Really scary, man. We could lose this fish at any time. Right now, I'm really worried we're gonna pull the hook. The fish has changed directions a lot, and that's definitely wearing a hole in his mouth. Anytime a fish makes a lot of evasive moves, there's a good chance it could pull the hook. DRAKE ROY: We really need this fish. This is a nerve-racking fight, right here. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Gladiator, baby! DRAKE ROY: We're the gladiators. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Gladiators. DRAKE ROY: Full of piss and vinegar, baby. Pinwheel, baby! We tight! I got him. He's coming, he's coming, he's coming! Right here, right here, right here! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: I'm ready, bro, I'm ready. Walk him right in. DRAKE ROY: There he is, there he is, there he is. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: He's going back away from us or what? You wanna back up to him? I can. DRAKE ROY: No, back up on him and dart him right here! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Oh, no! DRAKE ROY: There he is, there he is, there he is! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Go and back away from us or what? You want to back up to him like? DRAKE ROY: No, back up on him and dart him right here! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Oh no. Oh that was my bad that was stupid. That was dumb. I should be embarrassed over that, I should have hit that thing. DRAKE ROY: Let's just get him. Let's get him. I got him right here, right here, right here! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: I can't see him. I drilled him, dude I drilled him. Tail gaff, tail gaff! Big fish, bro! Big fish! Woo! You holding him? DRAKE ROY: I got him. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: That's a big tail. All right I got the gaff. Let go! Let go! Let go! I got it! How do you like that, baby? DRAKE ROY: Woo! Pinwheel, baby! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Pinwheel! Ow! DRAKE ROY: Ow! Let's go! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Whoo! DRAKE ROY: Yeah, baby! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Yeah! Yeah, baby! Tuna dot who? DRAKE ROY: Whoo! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Hey you kicked ass, bro. DRAKE ROY: [Bleep]! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Oh, thank you tuna Gods! DRAKE ROY: Yeah, whoo! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: I couldn't ask for better mate than Drake. Drake's been everything that I could have hoped for in a deckhand so far. Look at the sickle fins on this thing! TRAVIS BROWN: Sickle fins. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: That's a real giant blue fin. Just so you know, that's a big tuna. DRAKE ROY: Money in the bank. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: He's a 97-incher, man. DRAKE ROY: 97-incher. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: This is a good fish! We just caught ourselves a big tuna. All right. DRAKE ROY: Stoked to have him, baby. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: So pumped. DRAKE ROY: Pinwheel, baby! JOE MARCIANO: He's right at 32, down deep. He's coming up. He's at 30. DAVE MARCIANO: We didn't catch a fish last week. DAVE MARCIANO: My crew, my wife, my kids all depend on me finding fish. JOE MARCIANO: It's definitely a Bluefin. DAVE MARCIANO: It's crucial we turn this mark into a bite and put a fish on this deck. JOE MARCIANO: He's higher. He's still streaking up! This could be good guys. He's checking out the bait. There's a second mark. DAVE MARCIANO: A second mark? JOE MARCIANO: The second one is not a tuna! JASON MUENZNER: Oh, no! Seal! Seal! DAVE MARCIANO: Dammit! JOE MARCIANO: Tuna's gone now. DAVE MARCIANO: Seals love to check out the bait and the chum. And in my experience, they spook anything else that's around including tuna. So we end up with nothing on the line and a lost paycheck. Dammit. We're out of the game anyway. You can't really blame the seal but dammit, we need a tuna on the deck. We ain't got it together in this trip. DAVE CARRARO: TJ! Hey, TJ, come in. TJ OTT: Dot Douche. Dot Com's trying to reach out to us right now, but really he's the last guy I feel like talking to. DAVE CARRARO: Hey, TJ, come in. TJ OTT: You know, last year, he, he, he thinks he didn't do anyone wrong, but he's being doing people wrong forever. That's how he approaches this stuff. I don't hate anyone but I just don't respect him. I don't know when I'll be ready to talk to Dave on the Dot Com, but right now is not the time. DAVE CARRARO: The Hot Tuna is an important boat in the fleet. I can't afford to be on TJ's bad side. If I can't reach TJ out here, I'll find him in town. TJ? You there? TJ OTT: Come on. DAVE MARCIANO: Yeah, it's fine, it's fine, Jay. Not a problem. When we're fishing this hard over a period of days, we all just take short naps when we can get them in. The lack of sleep can take its toll. Not only on me, on the guys as well. Just hand me up the 80 reel we've been using. DAVE MARCIANO: No, just hand it when you go down, and put it up here, I'll set it up. DAVE MARCIANO: There's one down there again, just below the stick, coming up to it. JASON MUENZNER: Oh, Dave! Dave! Dave! DAVE MARCIANO: What? JASON MUENZNER: Dave! DAVE MARCIANO: What? What? What? JASON MUENZNER: The chum. The chum. DAVE MARCIANO: I'm gonna get him. I'm gonna get him. We got this one. Ah, damn, it's a shark. Ugh, [bleep]. Damn wretched [bleep]! Dammit! Dammit! Dammit! I'm just a little tense! Can't get a break! BRANDON PIERCE: I think you should do a push up for every day that we haven't caught one. ERIN SPEECHES: Me? BRANDON PIERCE: We only have one fish so far. They don't always come one after another. Sometimes you got to wait a little while. PETE SPEECHES: Part of the game. The pressure to stay number one is on. We really got to get a fish soon 'cause time is really ticking by. The Gloucester fleet has some of the best fishermen on the east coast. I'm starting to get a little nervous. Oh. ERIN SPEECHES: My dad gets stressed and he's already almost at his boiling point. I just hope that once the fish do start biting, I can do what needs to be done. This is my first time working for my Dad on the boat and I'm learning a lot. After graduating college and looking for a job, I decided that this summer could be my only opportunity to do this. I just wanna make him proud. PETE SPEECHES: We're marking. We're marking them. BRANDON PIERCE: We're on! PETE SPEECHES: We're on! We're on! BRANDON PIERCE: Yeah, we're on, baby. We're on. Woo! PETE SPEECHES: Yep. BRANDON PIERCE: We've got to land this fish. Yeah, buddy. When you hookup, it's an immediate shot of adrenaline. And obviously excitement and at the same time you're nervous too. PETE SPEECHES: Come on, Brandon. Grind, grind! ERIN SPEECHES: Let's go, Brandon. Reel! PETE SPEECHES: Let's go. You got it. ERIN SPEECHES: I'm slowly starting to get the hang of what to do when the rod bends. There's so much commotion all at once. I'm kind of like, Ah, what do I do? Where do I go? PETE SPEECHES: You want to move that rod there, bub? BRANDON PIERCE: It's right there. It's out here. It's out here. Little slow getting my gloves for me but, that will come in time. PETE SPEECHES: Let him run on this one. Let him run now. BRANDON PIERCE: He's up top. ERIN SPEECHES: You got this. BRANDON PIERCE: Dammit. It's a shark. PETE SPEECHES: Sharks in the tuna game are a nuisance to us because they come in, they eat your bait, they take away your hooks, they destroy your leaders. It's very expensive. BRANDON PIERCE: That is a monster. PETE SPEECHES: We started this week at the top of the fleet. But right now, I'm afraid we're going to end this week at the bottom. ERIN SPEECHES: That's not what we were looking for. PETE SPEECHES: Can't catch a break, man. Can't catch a break. DAVE CARRARO: Just got really excited to get back in. Offload the fish and see what it's going to bring. The only thing hanging over my head is getting my friendship back on track with TJ. At least for the moment, I can focus on the positive. Getting a paycheck for this fish. How's it going? BUBBA: Pretty good. How you been? DAVE CARRARO: Just got this one here. BUBBA: All right, we'll check it out. DAVE CARRARO: What do you got, Bubba? BUBBA: Six hundred and fifteen pounds dressed. DAVE CARRARO: Big one, that's all right. SANDRO MANIACI: Big boy. Wow. DAVE CARRARO: Our first two fish of the season were only seven and eight dollars a pound. I need this fish to fetch at least twelve dollars a pound. Ooh! BUBBA: A little dry. DAVE CARRARO: Mmm-hmm. BUBBA: Tiny bit of fat, an early season fish. DAVE CARRARO: What do you think? BUBBA: Eight dollars a pound. SANDRO MANIACI: I'll take eight. Eight for a big fish like that. DAVE CARRARO: Eight, times 6. Forty eight hundred. SANDRO MANIACI: At least, yeah. DAVE CARRARO: Thanks Bubba. I'm bummed we keep bringing in low quality fish but at the end of the day, it's still a five thousand dollar payday. Now, I gotta track down TJ, and I gotta do something to patch up our relationship. NARRATOR: Dot Com's third fish of the season is enough to push them into the lead, meanwhile, Pinwheel has a fish on board they have yet to weigh in. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ PAUL HEBERT: All righty, we got two new leaders right there. You know, we can cut back on the main line. Get those out. Ohhhh!!! Nothing. BRAD KRASOWSKI: If we hook up with a 500-pounder, everything will be just right. We break the ice and get one, you know. PAUL HEBERT: Keep an eye on them. Let's see how they. LANCE SISTARE: I'm on it, dude. I'm here. This is my deck. PAUL HEBERT: How are these doing down here? LANCE SISTARE: I'm like a freaking radar out here. PAUL HEBERT: You guys happy? LANCE SISTARE: I just looked at them. Yep. PAUL HEBERT: This season, I have a lot to prove. For years I've been telling everybody I know how to bring in these fish. And now they're going to see it for themselves. The boat's good, crew's good, if we had a tuna, it just would be insane. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Paul's gone through a lot of different crews over the years, but I think he's learned how to be a good captain, this is his year. PAUL HEBERT: That looks like herring there on the bottom. Look at all that. We're marking a pod right now. LANCE SISTARE: Fish hard. PAUL HEBERT: Big, big mark. LANCE SISTARE: Keep a good attitude and attitude's everything. PAUL HEBERT: Oh, here we go, we're on. Here we go, here we go. PAUL HEBERT: It's a tuna, baby. LANCE SISTARE: Untie the boat! BRAD KRASOWSKI: I got the anchor line. PAUL HEBERT: Two! Double! Double! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Start the main! Start the main! Start the main! PAUL HEBERT: Here we go! I got the boat. Bang! Double! Here we go. BRAD KRASOWSKI: It's chaos. LANCE SISTARE: Clearing the lines. PAUL HEBERT: I loosened up on it. LANCE SISTARE: Because as soon as the lines cross, you're definitely losing one, if not both of the fish. You got one rod coming around. So Brad's going around the bow of the boat, to make sure those fish are separated. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Here you go. PAUL HEBERT: Relax. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Tuna on the line. LANCE SISTARE: Where do you want it Brad? PAUL HEBERT: Up and over me. LANCE SISTARE: Oh! PAUL HEBERT: Relax. LANCE SISTARE: Yeah. PAUL HEBERT: Relax. LANCE SISTARE: Okay. PAUL HEBERT: All right. That one's locked in. Keep it down. Don't let it shoot out. LANCE SISTARE: It's how it happens. All hell breaks loose. You never know. You got to keep that positive attitude and good things will happen. PAUL HEBERT: We're gonna really be on our game to land these fish. Lance, watch yours now. Just keep him a little tight, all right? Came here for a couple tuna. This one's going pretty good now. LANCE SISTARE: A big fish. This is what it's all about right here. PAUL HEBERT: They have 5, 600 pounders. It's hard to tell but they are fighting real good. Could be 20,000 dollars if we can get them. LANCE SISTARE: She's dumping. PAUL HEBERT: It's hard to coordinate two fish on at once. LANCE SISTARE: Oh, where'd you go? PAUL HEBERT: The biggest risk, if you get those lines crossed, they will cut each other up, then you'll have no fish. LANCE SISTARE: All right, I'm tight. Keeping him tight. Brad's got the other one. We want to get that other one in first. We'll keep some pressure on this one. BRAD KRASOWSKI: One more circle. LANCE SISTARE: Color. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Here you go, Lance. Right here, Buddy. PAUL HEBERT: Go! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Beautiful. LANCE SISTARE: Nice dart shot. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Beautiful. Beautiful cut. PAUL HEBERT: Oh, it came out. We're going to lose this fish. Look out. Look out, gaff! PAUL HEBERT: Dart it came out! We're gonna lose this fish! Look out! Look out, gaff! Look out! Did he take off? BRAD KRASOWSKI: Not far, not far. PAUL HEBERT: Hit him right in the gill. The first harpoon throw of the season, and I hit the friggin' gill plate. PAUL HEBERT: It's like an armored coat. It's like throwing a rock against a cement wall. That's not good, especially when we need this time to catch the other fish that's on the other line! Watch out! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Stick 'em now! He's right here! PAUL HEBERT: Got 'em. All right. Gaff right next to me? Got 'em? Brad, get a tail rope. All right. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Thank you. PAUL HEBERT: Get on the rod, get on the rod. Good job guys, good job. LANCE SISTARE: Yeah, there's one! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Now we gotta get this guy. PAUL HEBERT: How we doing on the other one? BRAD KRASOWSKI: He's fighting for his life, he doesn't wanna come up here and see what we have in. PAUL HEBERT: He's fighting for his life, and we're fighting for our survival. BRAD KRASOWSKI: He's coming. LANCE SISTARE: You better get ready, chief. BRAD KRASOWSKI: He's tail-wrapped I think. Get that tail rope, Lance. PAUL HEBERT: Come on Brad, got him! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Tail rope! PAUL HEBERT: That's how you do it. LANCE SISTARE: You own it, Brad! Nice job! PAUL HEBERT: Ow! Ow! LANCE SISTARE: Oh, you, sorry dude. PAUL HEBERT: Calm down. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Good job! PAUL HEBERT: Yes, we got them! LANCE SISTARE: Yeah baby! Two in the boat! Both in! PAUL HEBERT: My fingers are crossed that we get a good paycheck out of this. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Go. LANCE SISTARE: Oh! PAUL HEBERT: That's it, this is a big fish. Good! BRAD KRASOWSKI: 700 pounder. PAUL HEBERT: Wow. LANCE SISTARE: Beautiful. She's awesome. A beauty. Finally got a paycheck in the boat. Nice fish man! PAUL HEBERT: Here you go. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Woo! PAUL HEBERT: See? 98-and-a-half right here! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Woo-hoo! LANCE SISTARE: Heh heh! [WHISTLE] BRAD KRASOWSKI: Nice job, brother! PAUL HEBERT: This is the big one. LANCE SISTARE: Ooh! PAUL HEBERT: All right, easy! Let him down real, real slow! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Wow, nice one man! This is great. PAUL HEBERT: 86 inches. LANCE SISTARE: 86, baby. BRAD KRASOWSKI: I think we should have, I think we should say a little prayer and thank. PAUL HEBERT: Yeah. Me too. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Thank Mother Nature for these guys. LANCE SISTARE: Yep. Definitely a big uh shout out to Mother Nature on this, uh. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Thank you. LANCE: We really appreciate it. BRAD KRASOWSKI: We'd like to thank the tuna gods for giving these guys up for us today. Keep a roof over our heads. PAUL HEBERT: Yep. BRAD KRASOWSKI: Thanks, guys. PAUL HEBERT: I don't care what they say, the Wicked Pissah's here to stay. [LAUGHS] DAVE MARCIANO: We're at the end of the second week, the other boats are catching, but it feels like the Hard Merchandise is dead in the water. Last season, we were the top boat, but down in the Outer Banks, we didn't catch any keeper tuna, almost scuttled the boat, and lost a lot of money. I have to prove what we accomplished in Gloucester, wasn't a fluke, and we can do it again. We need this, bite, bite. JASON MUENZNER: We're on! DAVE MARCIANO: What? JASON MUENZNER: We're on! JOE MARCIANO: We got this guys, we got this! Let's go, kid, let's go! Get on 'em! Good job, let 'em run. Yeah, here you go! DAVE MARCIANO: We're tuna fishing at night, boys! JOE MARCIANO: Keep wrangling, keep crankin', keep crankin'. JOE MARCIANO: Yep, yep, yep! We were losing faith, end of the night, about to wrap it up for the night, and we got a bite. Couldn't be more stoked. DAVE MARCIANO: Looks like a big fish, Jay. JOE MARCIANO: Yep. DAVE MARCIANO: Let 'em go, Jay, let 'em tire. Now just let 'em go. We're a long way from catching him. It is the shy gear that we got 'em hooked on, but it's our smallest hooks and our lightest leader. We're gonna need some luck to land this one, that's for sure. JASON MUENZNER: Let's get 'em? Get em, get em get em, here he comes on up, here he comes on up, here he comes, here he comes. Dump him, Joseph. DAVE MARCIANO: Uh, he's gonna keep turning like that. JASON MUENZNER: Good job, good job baby, good job. DAVE MARCIANO: Ah, crazy fish. JASON MUENZNER: All right. DAVE MARCIANO: God, that's classic for these bigger fish. JASON MUENZNER: I love this [bleep]. I love it. Even though I haven't slept for like 20 hours, bringing in tuna is what I live for. JASON MUENZNER: I'm tired, but I'm not stopping! JOE MARCIANO: All right. It's getting late. It's been almost two hours on this fish. He refuses to give up. JOE MARCIANO: All right. Take a nap. DAVE MARCIANO: I think we're close to three hours now! JOE MARCIANO: Call in the closer! Do you copy? DAVE MARCIANO: The thing will not stop swimming. Eh, it's gonna take an hour to get 'em up this last 30 feet. DAVE MARCIANO: The longer we're pulling on that fish, that hook hole in his mouth is getting bigger and bigger and bigger. At any second, if he gets a little bit of slack line, that hook could drop right out. Easily, you could lose the fish. DAVE MARCIANO: Dammit! He's going under the boat Jay! He's right up under the boat. DAVE MARCIANO: Dammit. He's going under the boat Jay! He's right up under the boat. JASON MUENZNER: Watch the line! Watch the line! DAVE MARCIANO: Let's hope that leader holds and the line holds. This fish does not know the meaning of the word give up, that's for sure. JASON MUENZNER: Come on! DAVE MARCIANO: I think we're over five hours now. Sooner or later, he's going to die of old age. Either that or I am. JOE MARCIANO: Got color, out there. DAVE MARCIANO Yup. Yup. Yup. Come on. Here he come, he's coming. Hey. Let's put a harpoon through it. I missed him. JASON MUENZNER: One more time. Ready? Right out between you. Come on. Come on. Yes! JOE MARCIANO: Need another one. DAVE AND JASON: No. JOE MARCIANO: All right. DAVE MARCIANO: Oh, man. JASON MUENZNER: That's a big boy. DAVE MARCIANO: Enough. JASON MUENZNER: That's it! DAVE MARCIANO: Yeah! JOE MARCIANO: Yeah! JASON MUENZNER: That's it. Yes! DAVE MARCIANO: Dude, well, done boys! DAVE MARCIANO: After almost two weeks with no catches and then boom, everybody's smiling, and we're in the game. JASON MUENZNER: Wow, is he round. DAVE MARCIANO: Yeah. That's how we do it on the Hard Merchandise. JOE MARCIANO: That's a fat one. DAVE MARCIANO: He's a fat round one. 99 inches. We'll take it like that. This 99 inch butterball is exactly what we needed. Perfect. Well done guys, well done. BUYER: What's up guys? What do you got today? DAVE MARCIANO: We got a nice one. BUYER: Nice! DAVE MARCIANO: 99 incher. BUYER: Sounds good, let's check him out. 505 pounds. DAVE MARCIANO: Nice, we'll take it. Let's see what he's worth here. BUYER: All right. Got good color, it's got plenty of fat in it, it's a good size. DAVE MARCIANO: Let's hear some big numbers. BUYER: It's a nice fish, we'll do 15 dollars a pound. DAVE MARCIANO: Nice! JASON MUENZNER: Nice. BUYER: All right, sweet. DAVE MARCIANO: All right, well done, man. All right, well done, Joe. The Hard Merch is back in the game. NARRATOR: Hard Merchandise's first tuna of the season gives them a much-needed payday. PAUL HEBERT: This is gonna be our first check for the season on my own boat. If it's a good paycheck, it'll bring the attitude up on the guys. That will get us a good week next week. Let's get fish number one up. BUYER: Let's see what we've got boys. 249 pounds dressed. PAUL HEBERT: Bam! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Woo! PAUL HEBERT: I like it. BUYER: Pinkish tail, it's got some decent fat to it. This fish here, 12 dollars a pound. LANCE SISTARE: Sweet. We'll take it. Nice, nice, nice. BUYER: Let's see what the other one looks like. PAUL HEBERT: This is the big one. What have we got? What have we got? BUYER: 401 pounds dressed. PAUL HEBERT: We'll take it! BUYER: Inside core color's good, tail's nice and pinkish. PAUL HEBERT: Right up there. BUYER: 13 dollars a pound. LANCE SISTARE: Sweet, we'll take it man. 13. Yeah: PAUL HEBERT: ... I wanted 18, but 13 is good. LANCE SISTARE: Thanks a lot man. BUYER: I think I'm going to see a lot of fish off this boat this summer. LANCE SISTARE: Oh, yeah. PAUL HEBERT: It's the best start I've had ever. NARRATOR: Wicked Pissah's double cash edges them slightly ahead of last season's champion, Hard Merchandise. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Dude, we finally got some quality for you, brother. BUYER: Well, it's about time! TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: We started this week in fourth place but if we get a good price for this monster, we could shoot to the top of the fleet. Come on what have we got here? BUYER: Not bad Tyler, 484. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: I'm stoked, man, that's a great fish. BUYER: Nice clear core. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: What am I going to get? BUYER: Looks good. 15 dollars a pound. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: Perfect. Thanks brother. Appreciate that, I'll take that all day. BUYER: All right. We'll get back. TYLER MCLAUGHLIN: We'll get some more of these. NARRATOR: Pinwheel's seven-grand fish launches them into the lead at the end of week two of fishing. TJ OTT: What's up, Dave? Dave Dot Com's been calling me. I'm finally ready to talk to him and see what he has to say. DAVE CARRARO: I got something for you. TJ OTT: Uh-oh, all right, I can't wait to see what that is. DAVE CARRARO: I just simply want to get our friendship back on track. TJ OTT: What's happening? DAVE CARRARO: What's up, pal? TJ OTT: What are you doing? DAVE CARRARO: I got a little something. TJ OTT: What do you got? DAVE CARRARO: It's for uh, last year. I know you could use this right now. TJ OTT: Oh, my favorite. DAVE CARRARO: Hey, we worked together for a long time. And, you know, we had what we had last year. TJ OTT: Yeah. DAVE CARRARO: I'm over that, but, you know. TJ OTT: It might take another bottle or two of this... DAVE CARRARO: I got, I got plenty more. I'll get you a bigger one next time. TJ OTT: Burying the hatchet right now with Dave is a big gamble for the Hot Tuna, it could end up biting me in the ass but life's too short not to give him second chance. DAVE CARRARO: You put me on some fish, I'll get you another one. TJ OTT: Anyway man, we just, we got to get on the meat. That's it. DAVE CARRARO: All right, let's do it then. Let's get it back the way it was TJ OTT: Yeah, cheers. DAVE CARRARO: Now I'm happy, nothing's hanging over us. We can move on and catch fish. Bygones be bygones. TJ OTT: This is Dave's last shot though. If he betrays my trust again, that's it. We gotta catch a lot of fish. DAVE CARRARO: We got find fish. We gotta do what we gotta do. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: So what do you think? We're going to kill this time, right? MIKE OTT: I hope so, man. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: HT what's up, man? TJ OTT: What's up? MIKE OTT: What's going on? TJ OTT: Look what I got! MIKE OTT: Ooh, hoo, hoo! TJ OTT: Got a little present, man. Look at that, huh? MIKE OTT: From who? TJ OTT: Oh, you'd never guess. TJ OTT: Dot Com, baby. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: No way, dude. TJ OTT: Oh, yeah. MIKE OTT: What, is he trying to suck up to you again and be friends? TJ OTT: Ah, no, man. Don't be so negative. He, he, he. MIKE OTT: Guy screwed us over. TJ OTT: This is a nice gesture. This is my favorite flavor. MIKE OTT: Yeah, it's not going to win me back yet. TJ OTT: It's. MIKE OTT: He took money out of our pockets, he screwed us. Right or wrong? JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: I know and he totally screwed us. TJ OTT: If he does it again, that's it, the door's completely closed. But what if he does put us on some meat? MIKE OTT: Until we see it, I'd take that gesture very lightly. TJ OTT: we're forgiving people, you've got to be kind. MIKE OTT: I just don't like people that screw us over and that guy screwed us over. TJ OTT: Let's get out there, let's rig the rods, let's do our thing, let's kill some fish and not worry about Dot Com, but I'm just telling you that's the deal. All right? JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: Sounds good to me, man. TJ OTT: All right, let's get it done. MIKE OTT: All right. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: Let's go fishing. MIKE OTT: Yeah.
