 PETE SPEECHES: Only talk to me if I need it. NARRATOR: Catching. TJ: Thank you. JASON: Go! Go! Go! DAVE: Oh! NARRATOR: Wicked Tuna. At the start of week three, Pinwheel leads the pack, meanwhile Hard Merchandise, Erin and Sarah, and Hot Tuna languish behind with only one fish each. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ PETE: It's been a while. Everybody's nervous for sure. We're behind so we got to keep going. It's week three of the season and we've only caught one keeper so far. Last week we left our home base in Portland, Maine and steamed 60 miles south of the Jeffreys Ledge to fish with the Gloucester Fleet. The round trip cost us about a thousand bucks in fuel and then after all of that, we struck out and didn't catch. Some of the Gloucester guys have caught two or three already. This week I'm playing it safe and staying closer to home in Maine. I feel like I'm not doing as well as I should be. It's tough. It's tough on the head. Oh, there's a good mark. We're on! We're on! BRANDON: Good wakeup call. Trying to find my bearings right now. ERIN: This job is hard. You are kind of running on no sleep. PETE: You got plenty of time to sleep when you're dead. Remember? How many times have you heard me say that? [LAUGHS] PETE: Doing good, Brandon. Doing good. That thing took a lot of line on that first run, man. BRANDON: Yeah, it did. PETE: I think this is a tuna. It was, it was pounding like a tuna. BRANDON: Yeah, it's a keeper. No question about that. PETE: It's a challenge. We've lost quite a few so makes each one more important. We need to capitalize on every bite we get now. ERIN: Let's go Brandon. Reel! My dad is not accustomed to going a long time without a fish So this drought is really taking a toll on him. I'm hoping that this is gonna be the end of the dry spell. PETE: Watch your line. ♪ [MUSIC ♪ BRANDON: Ah! Gone! PETE: Pulled the hook? BRANDON: Pulled the hook. Dammit. PETE: We didn't need that to happen. That's for sure. BRANDON: No, nothing wrong with it. Just pulled the hook. PETE: I've never pulled so many hooks. What's going on? ERIN: Right now the Erin and Sarah is in need of a serious morale boost. PETE: [Bleep]. Oh, I'm discouraged. PAUL: You there, Dave? DAVE: Yeah, Paul. What's up? PAUL: A lot of bait under the boat. Wow. After catching two fish last week, we're in third place and looking to get on a hot streak now. DAVE: What do you got, what are you up on a high ground there? Looks like you're right at your shoal. PAUL: It's week three and we're at Stellwagen Bank and we're right next to Dot Com. Stellwagen Bank is 20 some odd miles long. It goes from Provincetown to Gloucester. This has been honey hole for Dave and I for over 30 years. We're comfortable here anyways, you know what I mean? You, you know that. I, I feel like I'm home right here. DAVE: Yeah, we know how to catch 'em here. And you know what, we're right in our backyard. PAUL: I love fishing here. But it feels better shooting the breeze with my old pal, Dave. Just one boat owner to another. This sunfish, dude, is swimming right at me on the tether line! How funny is that? [LAUGHS] I've never seen anything like it. We stopped working together three years ago, when I was a mate on Dave's boat. It's a [bleep] job for babies, anyway. DAVE: Paul's having a little [bleep]. PAUL: You've been [bleep] sleeping all the time. DAVE: One captain, and one captain only and that's me. You're fired. PAUL: Now, we are so much tighter than ever before. How funny is that? Wait 'til you see this. He was scratching his back all the way on the tether line, all the way up to my little white float. DAVE: There's something wrong with that boy. He's not even making sense, he's just, he's out of it. Yeah, we're going to follow him in and come on over and check that out, Paul. That sounds pretty cool. It's great that Paul wants to be buddies but I've got a boat to run. We caught three fish in two weeks and I wanna keep that momentum going. So if I got to spend time on the radio. TJ: You on there? DAVE: I wanna do it with a respected fisherman in the fleet TJ: Come in, come in, come in. DAVE: What's up, buddy? You got anything cooking? TJ: We have nothing. This is torture. DAVE: Ouch. TJ: Yup. God, I thought I was gonna come down here and see like fins and tails. DAVE: Last season, I didn't reciprocate information for TJ. TJ: Any bites up that way this afternoon. DAVE: Not a one. GEORDIE SOUSA: Shh. DAVE: We had a falling out. TJ: Did you break your fingers fighting 'em all? You couldn't dial a phone? DAVE: I extended an olive branch to TJ last week. Bygones be bygones. But if we get fish here and I gave him some good intel that'll further solidify our working relationship TJ: All right, bro. Give you a shout in a little bit. Good luck. DAVE: Talking a little bit here. JASON: And you guys know the deal. Next trip out. We're either gonna get 'em. DAVE MARCIANO: Or you're not. At the end of last week, we finally got the monkey off our back and got our first fish of the season. We've been doing this a long time. I know one thing for sure, slow and steady can win the race. We're out here hunting down bounties. [LAUGHS] JOE: Is this the Millennium Falcon, then? DAVE: This boat's kind of like that. You know, you, every now and then you got to, you got to whack it when it doesn't start, it doesn't go, kick the controls and we can usually get it going. It's just not quite as fast. [LAUGHS] I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I mean it's been that way since I was a kid. I waited in line to see that movie 18 times when it came out. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna have to get out of my C-3PO costume. JASON: What about Paul? DAVE: Paul might be that Jar Jar Binks dude. JASON: All right [inaudible] DAVE: He talks a lot. JASON: Jar Jar Binks is Paul? DAVE: Who's Dave on the Dot Com? JASON: Oh, Darth Vader. DAVE: Darth Vader, right? JASON: Darth Vader. DAVE: Without a doubt. Without a doubt. Tyler? JASON: Ty, oh. He'd be Princess Leia. DAVE: Princess Leia. Yeah, I think that's a good one for him. JASON: 'Cause he's always, always, always causing drama. So who am I? DAVE: Huh? Who are you? JOE: You can be Anakin. [LAUGHS] JASON: No come on. Gimme something better than that. I'm supposed to be on your team. I'll be Chew, Chewy! Err! DAVE: We'll just have to get you some stilts. Hmm, catch tuna, we must! PAUL: A lot of bait there, Lancelot. LANCE SISTARE: Dude, I never had a bait rod bend like this. Look at these. PAUL: Stellwagen Bank just holds all kinds of bait. It's like a big aquarium. It's my tuna aquarium. LANCE: Oh! I can't judge Paul as a captain on the third week, but at this point not worried. PAUL: Fish down there. LANCE: Where? I was just looking. PAUL: There's a tuna down there. LANCE: Oh, I'm right there. PAUL: Dude, we got some fish streaking around. LANCE: Oh. PAUL: Oh! We're on! We're on! LANCE: Here we go. Yeah, we're on. Brad! Let's go! BRAD KRASOWSKI: Oh, yeah. We got fish. LANCE: Oh! That's him. BRAD: Yeah, that's good. That's sweet. PAUL: Yeah. LANCE: Got a fish on, man. Great feeling. First fish of the day. PAUL: Got the wheel, Brad? BRAD: Yeah. LANCE: It's a screamer, by her mouth. Oh, this is gonna be a nice fish too. It's a team effort out here. Head shakes. Violent head shakes. PAUL: Yeah, rod tip. Always look at the rod tip. LANCE: Gotcha, Cap. PAUL: If you need a fresh arm, Brad's right next to ya. LANCE: Fresh guy. Tagging in. PAUL: A fresh guy's always good. BRAD: I think I see him down there. I see a glow down there. I see him. PAUL: Yeah. He's right there. Yeah. BRAD: Hand me that dart, Lance. PAUL: I got it, Lance. I got it. LANCE: Great. BRAD: Okay, get him good. Thank you. PAUL: Get a gaff: BRAD: Gaff, Lance. PAUL: Come on. Tail rope around Brad. We got him. Hey! Right here! Brad! BRAD: That's how we do it, baby! PAUL: It's great to get the first fish of the trip, but we're not done yet. There's a lot more meat to be had here and with just us and Dot Com here. It should be really easy pickin's. Hey, you like that? That's a beautiful fish, dude. LANCE: You wanna measure it real quick? PAUL: Yeah, we can measure it. ALL: Eighty-five. PAUL: Good job, Lance. LANCE: Thank you. PAUL: That's a beautiful little tuna, dude. We'll get one more, watch. LANCE: Yeah, we're gonna get another one today. DAVE: Looks like Pissah got 'em. Paul just got a fish. I'm happy for them. But I wanna catch one now. GEORDIE: We're marking. DAVE: Right now we're marking tons and tons of fish under the boat. It's just a matter of time before we get a bite. Come on, bite. We're on! We're on! Comin' up on it now, right now hard. DAVE: We're on! We're on! Comin' up on the down, right now, hard. SANDRO MANIACI: Oh, my God! That's a real one there, baby. DAVE: That's the real deal. Nice, huh? Outta nowhere. SANDRO: That's why I sit out here! DAVE: He's a screamer. DAVE: Come on, Sandro! Reel, reel, reel! Come on, Sanchie! Get 'em, get 'em! Let's wear 'em down. Still got a long way to go. LANCE: Is he backin' down like it's a big one? PAUL: Oh, yeah! He's backin' down. LANCE: Oh, yeah. Whitewater. There's something's goin' over there. PAUL: Yeah, Dot Com's on, right now. BRAD: We're gonna pick off a few here this afternoon. PAUL: Oh, yeah. We're the only boats here. DAVE: Come on. Just get 'em, Geordie, get 'em. Nice job, Geordie. You got him close. Oh, man, I can feel it. We're gonna get him. We're gonna get him. There he is. I'm lookin' at him right there. Nice fish. Nice fish. Comin' up! He's big. Nice. Come on. You got it, Geordie. Color, color! We've got color! Get him, Geordie. Come on, Sandro! Nail it! Take the shot! Take the shot! Nice! Woo-hoo-hoo! Good shot. Come on! Get a tail-wrap on him. Seal the deal! Got one! Whew! Ka-ching! That's our fourth fish of the season. Oh yeah! Another one bites the dust. The end of the road for him. SANDRO: Rrgh! DAVE: It was a quick and easy fight. Nice job. We worked together as a team, and if we keep this up, we're gonna have a couple more to offload by week's end. GEORDIE: Eighty-nine. DAVE: Wow! Eighty-nine. We've only been out here since this morning, and us, and Wicked Pissah already have meat on the deck. It's a hot spot for sure. That's a diamond, pal. BRAD: Man, he's gaga. He's got him. PAUL: We're gonna go over to Dave, and check his fish out! LANCE: Steam it. Steam it, baby. Are you havin' fun yet? PAUL: Heh! DAVE: Sick, huh? SANDRO: Wow! That one's round. BRAD: Just drive-bys, right. We didn't mark that many. Big. PAUL: The meat is pink. SANDRO: The fish are beautiful, here. Beautiful. DAVE: Hey. We're gonna make a lot of money, here. Dude, they came through in a drove. The down-rod popped. You're gonna get another one. PAUL: Nobody needs to know about this but us. DAVE: Nobody really knows. PAUL: If you find a spot and you're catching fish, you gotta be careful in who you call. 'Cause they'll tell two friends, and they'll tell two friends. And then it'll be over. DAVE: TJ's, like he's callin' me askin', Hey, you seen anything? PAUL: Do not tell TJ. He knows way too many people. DAVE: Who is he to tell me not to tell TJ? Go fish! Don't talk to me. Go get another one. I'm caught in a bad spot. If I tell TJ, the Wicked Pissah crew is gonna be pissed at me. If I don't tell TJ, who I just said I'm gonna work with him, TJ's gonna be pissed at me. So regardless of what I do, somebody's gonna be mad. Good Luck. LANCE: Thank you. BRAD: All right, now. PAUL: Dave and I are in a good spot. It looks really good. There's fish here. But we're gonna try to keep it as quiet as we can. I think Dave will keep it quiet. Well, we'll see. TJ: Dude, this does not look good here today, bro. I haven't seen like a sign of anything. It's week three, and we've only managed one fish, so far. We struck out last week and we're really desperate to put some meat on the deck. TJ: Well, we're gonna have to find better fish here. We have to turn things around. DAVE: TJ, come in. TJ: I hear ya. DAVE: What's the scoop? TJ: Oh, any more around you? DAVE: Get over here. We just got one. Paul is about, uh, three-quarters of a mile to a mile away. He's sitting at 135, and we had bites at 192. PAUL: My ears are bleeding listening to this. He won't just go find a spot and fish. He has to call everybody and find out what's goin' on. TJ: If we're in a spot and the fishing is slow, and Dave gives us some info, I'm definitely gonna explore it. All right. We'll see you in a little bit. DAVE: Roger that. PAUL: Be a leader, not a follower. TJ: I don't have any better options right now. I just gotta go with it, put the throttle in the corner and hope for the best. MIKE: Right now Dave's tellin' us that he's on the meat, I have no reason to believe him. There's really no time right now for me to debate with TJ about this move. I just really hope it pays off. TJ: Makin' about 15 knots. We should be there in about 35 minutes. If we get a fish, it's because Dave helped us. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ TYLER: After a four-hundred and eighty-four-pound tuna last week, Drake and I are on top of the fleet. We can relax a little bit right now, and enjoy while we're out here, because we'd love to fish, and catch tuna. Because right now, we're kickin' butt. Are you buck naked? Oh, God! Naked boy, I'm not looking at you. DRAKE ROY: With me and Ty, it definitely feels like a brotherhood out there. I mean, we're doing everything together, eating, sleeping. TYLER: All right. Put some pants on. DRAKE: You have to be comfortable with your captain. TYLER: On the Pinwheel, we gotta shower outside. We're ghetto boating. At least we got hot water. Pinwheel, baby! Ghetto boating. Yeah. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ DAVE: Here comes TJ. About time he showed up. MIKE: Ready when you are. TJ: Ah, right there. Dave on the Dot Com has called us with some info, and he said it's really good fishin', and we need to be there, ASAP. Hopefully, it pays off. I hear both these guys land big fish? I gotta come here. BRAD: Look at what that is. PAUL: Where? Loose lips sink ships and it can also cost you a tuna fish. TJ is out here, right now. Can you believe that? TJ: We're markin', we're markin'! Fingers crossed. The lines are out. If they come through, you know, we're in position. And, you know, we've got good stuff out, so maybe it's our turn. MIKE: The first mark of the trip, these guys are getting bites around us. So, know that we know they're swimmin' under us, real encouraging. JARRETT PRZYBYSZEWSKI: We're on! We're on! We're on! [BARKING DOG] We got a bite! Hit it hard! TJ: Let him go, let him go, let him go! He's takin' a lotta line. He definitely knows he's hooked. Come on, Jarrett! Reel, reel, reel! Just like that. We're on, baby. Do you need a fresh arm for a minute? JARRETT: Yeah. TJ: Michael, get over there. Turn at him. Nice and smooth, nice and smooth. JARRETT: Definitely a good-sized fish. It took a hell of a good run, right off the bat. Got a lot of line back, but it looks pretty weird right now, the way it's fightin' as it's comin' in. TJ: Think he's tail-wrapped? He's definitely tail-wrapped. MIKE: When you have a tail-wrapped fish the line is tangled around the tuna's tail. TJ: Watch your tip. Pay attention. Not too aggressive. MIKE: That's a bad situation. You gotta be very, very careful with this. They could snap their tail hard and break the main line. TJ: Keep up on him, Michael. Don't, don't, you gotta keep up with him. JARRETT: Reba, get inside! Get inside. Inside. Inside! Come on. TJ: Jarrett, you get ready with the other harpoon. Just gimme this one. Stay by the controls. MIKE: Here's the leader! Leader. TJ: Keep reelin', keep reelin'! Keep reelin'. Keep reelin'. MIKE: He's tail-wrapped. TJ: Keep goin', keep goin'. MIKE: He's going wild. TJ: Get on the controls! Get on the controls! MIKE: Oh, no. TJ: Oh, God! Oh, God! TJ: He's definitely tail-wrapped. Jarrett you get ready with the other harpoon. You give me this one, stay by the controls. MIKE: Here's the leader. TJ: Keep reeling, keep reeling, keep going. MIKE: Leader. TJ: Keep reeling, keep reeling. MIKE: Tail wrapped, tail wrapped. TJ: Keep reeling, keep reeling. MIKE: He's going wild. TJ: Oh no, get on the controls, get on the controls! Oh God, oh God, oh God! Oh, so close. Big fish. Another 5 feet I would've had a dart in that fish. But he went wild just out of dart range, hopefully, we get 'em. PAUL: Looks like TJ is hooked up over there. LANCE: Yeah, what do you got Brad? BRAD: It's gotta be a big one. LANCE: Oh, boy we've been in that movie before. PAUL: That's our paycheck at the end of TJ's line. SANDRO: TJ's down and tight. DAVE: Yup. He'll get him. JARRETT: Color, color, color! Oh, no, it looks like he's pin wheeling. He's coming up. TJ: There he is. JARRETT: I see him. TJ: Try to get him coming at you here pretty good. Grab the harpoon! Grab the harpoon right there, stay right next to me. Come on get it, get it, get it, get it [bleep]. JARRETT: Hurry up, hurry up. TJ: [Inaudible] on it. JARRETT: Come on TJ. TJ: Get a gaff, watch out. JARRETT: No. Where is he, where is he? TJ: Over here, over here in the head. You got him in the head, head, head, head. Hold him tight! Got him? MIKE: I got him. TJ: Stick it in there. MIKE: I got him. TJ: Get another gaff, get another gaff. Get a gaff, get it in his tail, get it in his tail. MIKE: Give me, I got him, got him. This one pulled out. TJ: Yeah! [LAUGHS AND CHEERING] TJ: Yeah. Thank you, God. JARRETT: Pa-pow! TJ: Good job, great job. Great job. MIKE: Pork chop, baby. JARRETT: Woo. TJ: I can't begin to tell you how bad we needed this fish. Dave on the Dot Com told us to come here and now we've got a big tuna hanging off the side of the boat because of him. DAVE: TJ what happened? TJ: We got him. DAVE: All right, good going. TJ: This is a result of Dot Com, this one came from the Dot Com. DAVE: Yup. Told you. All right, get off the radio. Go just get another one. TJ: Yeah, thanks, I'll get back to you guys. I know you gotta get back on the anchor. Thank you. PAUL: Oh, my God. That could've been our fish. If Dave didn't go run his mouth to TJ, we could've just had another paycheck. What a [bleep] kick in the balls. TJ: All right. JARRETT: Whoo! MIKE: Yeah! TJ: Nice little unit. JARRETT: Reba. Hey, we got one. MIKE: Nice. We needed that. TJ: I am so happy this thing is on the floor of the boat right now. All right, let's see what we got, let's see what we got. 90! All right. MIKE: Yeah, baby! JARRETT: Outrageous, yeah. TJ: We'll take it. Good job, good job. JARRETT: Now we don't look like a bunch of losers out here. TJ: Good job, Babba. Pa-pow! ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ BUYER: Hey Paul, we got a big fish there! PAUL: After TJ showed up to our spot, I knew it was time to cash in and head in. That place will be plugged with boats tomorrow. What's she weigh, what's she weigh? BUYER: 254. PAUL: Yes. I like it. BRAD: Nice. LANCE: Nice. PAUL: The tuna buyer looks at the fat content, the shape, and the color of the meat to determine our price per pound. BUYER: Guys, on this fish here. PAUL: What do we got? BUYER: We got very nice color. Unfortunately, not a lot of fat on this fish. PAUL: All right. What do we get for a price? BUYER: I could get 11 dollars a pound for you guys. PAUL: That's cool. I'll take it. LANCE: Nice, yeah! Thanks, Greg. PAUL: As good of a spot that we were at, we should've come away with another couple fish. There's always tomorrow. NARRATOR: Wicked Pissah's three-grand catch pushes them into second place. SCOTT: What's going on guys? What do you guys have today? DAVE: Just got the one, that's it. SCOTT: Just one? DAVE: Let's get him up. SCOTT: Sounds good. DAVE: What's the dress weight, Scott? SCOTT: It's got 332 pounds dressed. SANDRO: Not bad. DAVE: What'd you think man? SCOTT: It's got everything you're looking for. It's got plenty of fat, good color, core's good. DAVE: Bottom line? SCOTT: Yeah, uh. DAVE: Good fish? SCOTT: This fish right here, 17 dollars a pound. SANDRO: Nice. GEORDIE: Love it. SANDRO: That's a good price there. DAVE: I like that. Feels good. Not only did we catch our fourth tuna of the season, but we also helped TJ to put meat on his boat. I think now, we're gonna put what happened in the past and we're gonna work together. He's got a huge network and a lot of valuable information to share. NARRATOR: Dot Com's good quality fish launches them into the lead. TJ: We got one beautiful fish for you. I hope you brought a lot of dough, Scottso. SCOTT: Check him out. We got 344 pounds. TJ: That's a respectable one, we'll take it. What do you got, Scottso? Looks like a nice one, right? SCOTT: I mean, you guys got yourself a good fish. It's got good fat, it's got a good color, the core's good. It's all around, good fish. So this fish will get you guys 18 bucks a pound. TJ: All right Scottso! JARRETT: Whoo! Nice. All right. MIKE: That'll pay some bills. TJ: We needed that, bro. JARRETT: Yeah. TJ: We're stoked. We 100 percent owe this fish to Dot Com. We would've never made this move without him calling us. NARRATOR: Hot Tuna's six-grand payday edges them into second place. PETE: You know, I don't remember marking so many fish coming to that down line and not biting. I have to catch fish because I have responsibilities on land. I, you know my kids depend on me, I have tuition to deal with. So it really takes a tremendous toll mentally on the captain because everything comes down to him. BRANDON: It's been well over a week since we caught our last tuna. I can't go that long without a paycheck. I got bills to pay and I gotta feed myself. So we need to get a fish right now. ERIN: When my dad gets stressed and things aren't really going the way that he wants, I know how to react to him when he's really frustrated. Dad, maybe you do need to bring back the porn stache and glasses. What do you think? And I can do my best to try to lighten the mood. BRANDON: Maybe he needs to bring it back, maybe that's the good luck charm. ERIN: You really need to commit to this tuna fishing. PETE: Keep this up, and you're going swimming. ERIN: There's sharks in the water. PETE: They won't eat you. ERIN: Why not? PETE: You got, look at you, you got, you got toothpick legs. ERIN: It doesn't matter. They're not after human blood. Sharks only attack 'cause they think that you're a fish. I don't know. PETE: Let's try it out, let's see. ERIN: I'm not going swimming until there's a tuna on this boat. My dad is a big believer in the tuna gods and everything needs to have a reason to explain why, and in this industry, that's what it is. The offerings for the tuna gods are as follows, I'm gonna go swimming. PETE: We can pull you back through the tuna door before a shark gets you. ERIN: Do you see what sacrifices I'm offering to the tuna gods? [LAUGHTER] Brandon is gonna kiss, make out, with the tuna. BRANDON: No. Can't say I've ever made a deal with the tuna gods to turn our luck around but, in a time of desperation, you'll do almost anything. ERIN: There we go, standards are set, tuna god. BRANDON: Might even slip in a little tongue. ERIN: That's disgusting. JOE: Oh, right behind the boat. JASON: You can see we're right in the whales. Circling us like jaws. JOE: That's a really good sign for some tuna to come through. We're just waiting still. We haven't marked a fish yet, but it's still early. DAVE: Without a good crew, I'm nothing more than a glorified two-bit, halfwit, tour bus driver. Jay and Joe, they work their asses off but it seems like they have a lot of fun. JOE: Oh, right behind the boat. DAVE: There's a mark, Jay. JASON: Come on! Eat it! Come on, now. We're on, we're on, we're on. JOE: Yeah, we're on, we're on, we're on. DAVE: Reel, reel, reel. JASON: That's him, that's him, that's him, that's him. JOE: Yeah! JASON: That's him! That's him! JOE: Yeah! DAVE: That stick's not gonna work. JASON: He's going up to the anchor! DAVE: I know, I know. Grab the, yeah, you got it. Pull it all the way. Let's work it down, work it down. JASON: Good job, Joe. JOE: Yeah, baby. JASON: That's him, Dave. JOE: That's that tuna bite. That's that tuna bit right there, baby. JASON: We're hooked up to a monster. DAVE: All right, guys. We're gonna get him now, nice and easy JASON: Took on a bunch of line at first, he ran up to the anchors and now we're just following him. He's going one way, we're trying to get him away from that anchor ball. Now, go ahead, keep going. Keep going. DAVE: This fish is a monster. He's taking so much line, the reel is almost empty. We don't have the fastest boat, so if we can't catch up to him, we're gonna lose this fish. JASON: Goin' out front! Goin' out front! Hard, hard, hard forward! JOE: We're almost out of line, almost out of line! DAVE: Hold on. Hold on. It's going, it's going, it's going. JASON: Dave we're almost out of line, we're almost out of line! Go, go, go! JOE: Oh. JASON: Dave, we're almost outta line, we're almost outta line! Now go ahead! Keep going! DAVE: We don't have the fastest boat. If we can't catch up to him, we're going to lose this fish. JASON: Goin' out front! Goin' out front! Hard, hard, hard forward! JOE: We're almost out of line! We're almost out of line! DAVE: We're makin' the jump to light speed. JASON: Go, go, go! Oh! Yeah! Good job! Good job! Yup, we're good! JOE: There you go! JASON: He almost emptied the reel completely! DAVE: We've managed to keep this fish from taking off on us and we're starting to tire him out. Nice and easy now. We gotta land 'em now guys. It's a screamer, Jay! JASON: That's a screamer! DAVE: Let's hope we get lucky, put this guy in the boat. JASON: Yeah, go ahead. JOE: Go. JASON: We got a screamer! Yeah, baby! Good fish, good fish! DAVE: Good work boys, good work, good work! JOE: Get it tight, get it tight, get it tight, get it tight! DAVE: He's there? JASON: I think! DAVE: Keep reeling! Don't stop! JASON: I think it's gone. Gone. DAVE: Keep going, don't stop! He's there. JASON: Where? JOE: He's still there, he's still there. JASON: Oh man! JOE: It's all right, buddy. We're good, we're good, we're good! DAVE: Wow, he ran right at you with a whole spool line out, and then he just charged the boat, straight at us. Jay thought he lost him! That's why you never stop reeling, till the hook gets to the tip! This fish has definitely been hooked before! JASON: I think I see him. I think I see him! I just saw him! DAVE: Yeah. He's way up on the surface. Right now, he's wearing himself down. JASON: Swim into the light! DAVE: Be ready, boys. We're gonna get color any minute. He should be above 20 now, guys. JOE: Come on, come on, come on. DAVE: I think we're pulling him up backwards, maybe! JASON: Think we are too. DAVE: If he does come up by the tail. JASON: Just lasso him. DAVE: Yeah. You guys gotta work together, make sure you get it on there quick. It's a one-shot deal. JOE: Let's go, let's go, let's go. DAVE: I see him out there, guys. JOE: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. JASON: There he is! There he is, by the tail! DAVE: Tail first! JASON: By the tail, Joe. I got it. JOE: You got it? JASON: Yup. Big fish! DAVE: Let me have the gaff, Joe. Use the long gaff. Yeah, there we go boys, nice and easy. JASON: That's how we do it! DAVE: Yeah! JOE: Yeah, got 'em! DAVE: Yeah! JASON: That's how we do it on the Merch! JOE: Good job, baby. That's another one! DAVE: Yeah! JASON: Bang, bang, bang. Big one! JOE: Got 'em! DAVE: Yeah! We got 'em, boys! JOE: Yeah! JASON: Tails up, baby! DAVE: Nice going! JASON: Tails up! JOE: Keeper for sure. DAVE: Nice going! Two fish, and they're two beautiful fish. Two weeks in a row. That's one in a row, twice. We're on a roll. I've got the best crew in the fleet! TYLER: Oh! Whoo! Boom! DRAKE: Boom shakalaka! TYLER: When you see the whales breaching and slapping their tails in the water, you know there's big schools of bait that are balled up around them. And that means where there's balls of bait, there's Bluefin tunas. The further you get in the week, the more stressful it gets. We've been waiting all week to see signs of life like this. Now we've got to make the most of it and put a fish on the deck. Oh, nice mark, dude! Whoo! We're on! We're on! DRAKE: We're on! TYLER: Did we hit him? I thought [inaudible] DRAKE: He hit him, he hit him, he hit him. TYLER: Oh, oh, oh. DRAKE: Come on, come on, come on. TYLER: Nah, I think he missed it. I think he missed it, bro. Oh we got him. DRAKE: No, no, no. TYLER: We got him, dude. He's on there. Watch this. We got him on there. Right? DRAKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. TYLER: Did he go? DRAKE: It's about to start bouncing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. TYLER: Ah! We got him, we got him, we got him, we got him. Tuna. It's a tuna. We're on, we're on! Oh! TYLER: Ah, we got him, we got him, we got him, we got him. DRAKE: Oh! TYLER: Tuna. It's a tuna. We're on, we're on! Got him on, dude. Nice bite. It's a down rod. This is being real erratic. He's, like, going, but he definitely doesn't know he's hooked. DRAKE: Here, here. Turn me, turn me, turn me. TYLER: I got you. I got you. Right here, is that him? DRAKE: Is that him? TYLER: Yeah. DRAKE: Is he circling? TYLER: Reel, reel, reel. DRAKE: Here, here, here. TYLER: Don't be easy with the gloved hand. DRAKE: Yup. See him? See him? Shot. Bring that basket over here. Bring that basket over here. TYLER: I got you. DRAKE: Here. Whoo! Yeah, baby. TYLER: Thank God! DRAKE: Woo! Pinwheel, baby. TYLER: Oh, dude, I'm in shock that we just caught a fish, dude I was really worried that we weren't going to get a Bluefin this week. Got him. But now, we're three for three. All right. Thank God. 75, dude. Hell yeah. DRAKE: Pinwheel, baby! JASON: Coming in! DAVE: And then let it slide down, Joe. Yeah. Down, down, down. He's in the middle of the deck. JASON: That's a nice one. Wow. Ninety-six and a half! DAVE: Ninety-six. This sends the perfect message to the rest of the fleet, that last year, when we wound up catching more fish than any of the other boats, it wasn't an accident. We can compete with all these fancy boats any given time, any given place. That's how we like it, boys. Well done. JASON: Tails up! DAVE: Well done. JASON: Blood on the deck! DAVE: Another one for Team Tuna! Clawing our way up the leaderboard, one fish at a time! ERIN: Where's the bait at? Like, right at 1:30? BRANDON: Yeah. It's 22 folds. Come on, you. ERIN: That's him, down. BRANDON: Eh, he kind of came back up, but he was somewhere far. It wasn't right under the boat. ERIN: We've gone almost three weeks since we caught our first and only keeper Bluefin. The frustrating part is that we're marking them. Just reel in the close herring, you said? Or the close water? BRANDON: Yeah, the close water, we'll put a herring on it. ERIN: Earlier today, I made a deal with the tuna gods that if they give us a Bluefin, that I'd jump in the water and Brandon has to kiss the tuna. I'm not sure if I believe in the tuna gods the way that my dad does, but at this point I'm willing to do anything that'll help change our luck. BRANDON: Oh! We're on! ERIN: Oh. BRANDON: We're on! Tell your dad, tell your dad. ERIN: We're on! We're on! BRANDON: Come on baby, make a run! There we go, reel that in. Yes. That's, we've been marking 'em for the last five minutes. PETE: Do you want me to get off the anchor there, Bruh? BRANDON: I'd wait a second. We did mark a fish, kind of came through twice. PETE: I can feel it. Got it? BRANDON: Yup. PETE: Put that on the couch. PETE: Nice and smooth now, Brandon. Nice and smooth! Stay focused, okay? BRANDON: Yeah! I want this fish more than, more than a lot of things right now. PETE: Hope we get 'em. Hope the fishing gods are good to me. It's important to get this fish. We need this bad. ERIN: It means our bad luck streak's over if we get this fish on board. PETE: Let's not talk about luck or bad luck until we can land this fish, okay? Watch that tip! Good job! BRANDON: See your ball, right? PETE: What? BRANDON: You said you see your ball, right Pete? Can't tell where he's at. I can't tell if he's behind that or what. PETE: I don't see anything! BRANDON: He's not playing by the rules. PETE: Where is he? We need this fish bad, we don't need him wrapped up in an anchor or lost. See if that ball starts moving, Erin. BRANDON: I can't tell what's going on, Pete. PETE: I can't hear you! BRANDON: I said I can't tell what's going on! PETE: Only talk to me if I need it! BRANDON: I will, that's why, I'm just letting you know. I don't know if he's in the ball or not. PETE: Don't lose him! Don't lose him! BRANDON: I think he's running towards the anchor! BRANDON: I can't tell what's going on, Pete. PETE: I can't hear you! BRANDON: I said I can't tell what's going on! PETE: Only talk to me if I need it! BRANDON: I will, that's why, I'm just letting you know. I don't know if he's in the ball or not. I think he's running towards the anchor! PETE: Don't lose him! BRANDON: I'm backing off a little. Pete, I think he's definitely in it. PETE: Keep the drag loose. BRANDON: I have the drag backed off quite a bit. BRANDON: I don't like that feeling. PETE: When the line's damaged, all the pressure we put on when catching a tuna, it could break at any minute. I'm just hoping the tuna gods will help us land this one. Give me that one gaff. BRANDON: Do you want me to come underneath you? PETE: Yeah. BRANDON: Move that gaff, Erin. Move that, I mean, move that harpoon, Erin. PETE: Got it. Don't back off too much. BRANDON: We got out of that one for right now. Line could've been damaged. We don't know what could've just happened during that. So, now we've got to take it extra careful with him. PETE: You back the drag back up? BRANDON: Yup. Got a really [bleep] spot in the line too. He may have rubbed on the anchor line. So we'd like to get that on the reel as quick as we can so that there's no strain on that part of the line. PETE: That fish does not want to go down. ERIN: Color. BRANDON: Grab the harpoon. PETE: Hard right. Let's go, Brandon! Keep him tight! Keep him tight! BRANDON: Coming back up! He's on this side! Other side! Right there! Nice. ERIN: Got him! PETE: Hurry up! We need a tail strap on him. BRANDON: All right. ERIN: Nice job, guys. PETE: All right. BRANDON: All right. PETE: Whoo! BRANDON: Nice job. PETE: Score! Finally. Nice job, Brandon. BRANDON: Yeah. Up high. Up high. ERIN: Whoop, whoop, whoop! PETE: Way overdue, right? ERIN: Tuna. BRANDON: Way overdue. ERIN: Tuna, tuna, tuna, whoo! PETE: It's a nice fish, it looks like. BRANDON: Big one. ERIN: Big. I'm hoping that from here on out, we're going to start catching a ton of fish. Thank you, tuna gods. PETE: Ninety-four! Ninety-four. BRANDON: I believe I do have to kiss the fish. Do I not? I I'd like to do that before it's bloody. ERIN: Smooches. BRANDON: So, all right, there we go. PETE: That was a pretty quick little, little peck. BRANDON: I know. Yeah, I know. PETE: Come on, we thought we were going to get a real kiss BRANDON: Hey he didn't even buy me dinner. All right? That's all, that's all it's going to get for right now. I've definitely kissed worse. ♪ [MUSIC] ♪ GUT: How ya doin', Pete? How'd you make out? PETE: We got one for you. One nice one. GUT: All righty, we'll take a look at him. 351. PETE: Perfect. We'll take that. GUT: Good-looking fat. Color looks decent. Oh yeah. Core looks fine. Yeah. On this one, hmm, give you 17 dollars. BRANDON: Awesome. PETE: All right. Good Job. Thanks, Scott. Appreciate it. BRANDON: We'll take that. PETE: All right. It's a great feeling. We're stoked, you know, energy is high and I'm praying that this breaks the streak and we can get on, get back on track. ERIN: Thanks, Gut. SCOTT: All right. Take care. NARRATOR: Erin and Sarah's six-grand fish pushes the team from Maine into second place. TYLER: Hey, I got one fish for you. Let me give it to you so we can get back out. GUT: All right, good enough. Looks like a tuna, only smaller, buddy! TYLER: I've got to catch what I can catch, man. What's it dress, Scott? GUT: 163! TYLER: Perfect. GUT: No fat in the fish. TYLER: What are you thinking? GUT: This one here. We can get you 9 dollars a pound for that. TYLER: It's better than having no tunas and still be sitting out there on the anchor. DRAKE: ...better than nothing. SCOTT: Yup. TYLER: That's three straight trips that Drake and I have gotten paid. As long as we keep getting paychecks, we're stoked. NARRATOR: Pinwheel's disappointing payday is still enough to give them a narrow lead over Erin and Sarah. BUBBA: How's it going? DAVE: Good, we got one nice one for you. I'll just come up there and see what he's worth. BUBBA: All right. JASON: Check him out! DAVE: What do we got, Bubba? BUBBA: 460 on the dot. JASON: 460! JOE: I'll take that! JASON: Show us the money. BUBBA: Nice cherry red all the way through. It's a nice, greasy fish. DAVE: Yup. BUBBA: Very beautiful color on the tail. JASON: You're killing me, hurry up. JOE: Anxious. DAVE: What do you think? BUBBA: I'll give you 18 dollars a pound. DAVE: Nice! JOE: Great. JASON: Good score! DAVE: Awesome. Boom. JOE: Good job. DAVE: Well done. Well done. All right. JOE: Good job, Jay. DAVE: It's a paycheck. We'll take it. That's a big score. The Hard Merchandise is back, better than ever. NARRATOR: Hard Merchandise's eight-grand tuna launches last season's champion into the lead for the first time this year. ERIN: All right, gentlemen. It's time for me to pay my dues. I said that I would jump in to make a sacrifice to the tuna gods. Do you think I'm gonna chicken out? BRANDON: Yup. ERIN: That's insulting. BRANDON: We've only marked, like, four sharks today and that was, like, an hour ago. ERIN: Yeah, that's totally cool. PETE: Let's go, see if you can get it done. I don't believe you'll do it. I think you're gonna chicken out. BRANDON: The wrath of the tuna gods will be great. ERIN: Here we go! PETE: All right, Erin! ERIN: Ah! PETE: How was that? How does it feel? ERIN: It's actually not that bad. PETE: I'm proud of you for not chickening out. Erin's a lot of fun to be around. She's very much of a comedian at times, and I knew that she'd lighten the mood on the boat during the bad spells, so I'm very proud of her for that in life, not just on the boat. One, two, three! Up! ERIN: Ah! I'm never going to turn down a challenge. All right! Show me the tuna!
