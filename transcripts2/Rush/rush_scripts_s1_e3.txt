 - Previously on Rush. - Oh. Where have you been? Does this ring a bell? - Not immediately, no. - What is going on with you? I finally had an opportunity to prove to someone that I could be there for them, and I screwed it up. Will. You made it. I thought you said he wouldn't - remember. This is bad. - It's fine. He's got to leave. Laurel, he's my best friend. - I need blood. - No, I'm not doing that.

 I would not be asking unless it were - very important. - ALEX: "Steal me some blood. Lose your job, and while you're at it, lie to your wife." I will call my dad. Seriously, man, you have to call him. Yeah, I know. I agree to waive my right - to an attorney. - Good. Then let's start. Have you ever been arrested, Mr. Rush? Dr. Rush, and yes, I have been arrested, but never incarcerated. Frequently intoxicated. Sometimes celebrated. - But never faint-hearted. - I'd take this

 seriously if I were you. You could be in a lot of trouble here. My bad, Officer. I'm sorry, continue. You sure you're a doctor? You don't act like any - doctor I know. - You sure you're a cop? I mean, you're way hotter than any cop - I've ever seen. - Keep up with the smart answers, Dr. Rush. I've got all night. Yeah. Unfortunately, I do, too. WOMAN: Hey, Megan, - the party's staring. - Oh. (laughs) All right. You do this type of thing a lot? - In-house bachelor party physician? - Mm-hmm. Uh, no, this is a first. Well, these guys are kind of pigs. Yeah? Well, in times of need, you go where the money takes you. And these pigs - can make it rain, Officer. - (short chuckle) At least your patients don't want to put their hands in your thong. Don't be so sure. Don't leave without saying good-bye. ♪ ♪ (grunting heavily) - (short breaths) - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Chris, what's going on here? - I'm freaking out. - Yeah? - I'm freaking out. Okay, all right, um, okay. Let me ask you to, uh, hold on to this, okay? - Uh-huh. - Don't let go of this, all right? Okay. Let me take a little listen to you. Oh. This is why we don't encourage mitral valve prolapse patients to ingest copious amounts of stimulants. I'm getting married tomorrow, Doc. - I can't die. - Yeah, well, lucky for you, your friends hired me. I just can't party quite as hard as I used to, you know? - Yeah. - My first two bachelor parties... those were crazy, but... - Third one's the charm, you know? - Yeah. This is the one. This is, uh, - my victory lap. You got that, right? - Mm-hmm. - Absolutely. - All right. Okay, good. This should keep you from dying. And this should turn that 45 that's going on in your chest into an LP. - What? - It'll slow your heart rate. Okay, I'm gonna have to ask you to snort this. Don't worry. It's just a fast-acting benzo with just a hint of barbiturate and a vibrant, oaky aftertaste. Yeah. Snort it. - Trust me, come on. - Okay. Ah. Ah. All right. Mm-hmm. Okay, now breathe, nice and easy. Nice and easy. There you go. - (laughs) - Huh? All right. Oh, ho. Wow. Yeah. - Well, that worked. - Yeah. Whoa, thanks, Doc. (exhales) (soft laugh) Hey, you do you have a... - a card or... - Sure. - Something? - Okay. - Thanks. - There you go. What the hell's this? That, my friend, is your ticket to long-lasting health. Uh, it doesn't have your name on it. I could have ten of these. How would I know I'm... I'm calling you? I could call, like, a real doctor by accident, you know? - (laughs) - A real doctor. Wow. (exhales) - Thanks for everything, Doc. - Yeah. Come on, you should smile. You just made 50 grand for 24 hours. - Smiling's extra. - All right. Ciao. Call me. All right. I certainly will, Officer. Great. (sighs) (knocking) Sh*** All right. Geez. I put on the... the thing. You read? Laurel. This is, uh, unexpected. This'll only take a minute. Oh, a minute might be too long. I've just taken an Ambien and it won't take no for an answer. - Did you call your father? - Oh, you know about that. Alex tells me everything. Yeah, well, I've been meaning to call, I just, you know, haven't had the chance yet, okay? Rush. Oh, sh***, ow. Look, I'm gonna call him, okay? I promise. It's just... I don't know, every time I pick up the phone, it's... you know, it's complicated. It was complicated for Alex to do what he did, but he did it. Will you tell Sarah? - What is this, junior high? - No, no. I just, you know... I'd like her to know I've done something good, for once. Sarah has nothing to do with this. I'll call my dad if you tell Sarah. Are you kidding? Five... - Oh, my God. - four... Rush. Three... two... Fine. Hmm. - Sync and corrected by TheDelta - - www.addic7ed.com - I brought you a coffee. Should I have brought the pot? You're eight minutes late. I'll take that as a yes. I want new business cards. What's wrong with the ones you've got? They've just got a number on them. You said you liked to just have a number. Yeah, but it let me seen like a stripper. That's exactly what you said you liked about it. I think maybe it's time to class up the joint a little bit, okay? So the new ones should say "William P. Rush, MD" loudly and proudly. You know? Not like someone who has a Bloody Mary for breakfast every morning. Thank you. - (phone rings) - Oh. Unknown. William P. Rush, MD. Hi, this is Max Zarella. I'm looking for Rush. Oh, hi. I'll see if I can get him. (whispers): Max Zarella. Oh. Hello, Max. Hey, Rush. How you doing, buddy? Oh, it's good to hear your voice. - What have you done now? - Oh, well... - uh, you know what a 5150 is? - Yeah. Involuntary psychiatric hold. Just for observation. Where exactly are you? Uh, County. Rush, it is bullsh... Well, if it's a 5150, Max, you must have threatened - to kill yourself. - Okay, I... listen, I said the words. Okay? I said the words, but it is all a complete misunderstanding. Oh. It's funny how often you're misunderstood. Listen, I-I was on the set of this movie, okay. It was the last day. I was tired, this director is a total dick. Okay... You just got to come and get me out of here. (sighs) All right, well, give me, like, a half hour. I need to take a shower - and stuff, okay? - No, no, no. No, no. No shower. No shower, buddy. Okay? This is not a date. Just get over here. And hurry up, okay? These doctors are crazy. (sighs) You got my, uh... great, thank you. - Check this out. - What? Oh. Max, Max, Max. Well, he always was an emotional guy. Oh, don't forget... new cards. All right. ♪ ♪ - You've reached the office of Dr. Warren Rush. - Oh, great. We're not able to take your call right now. Please leave a message and we'll return. - (beep) - Uh, this is, uh, Dr. William P. Rush. Uh... I'm-I'm Dr. Rush's son. C-Could you have him call me back, please? I-I think he has my number. ♪ ♪ (phone rings) Hey. The first thing I'm going to do after I deposit all of this cash... which smells a lot like stripper perfume... - is find your cards. - You might get a call today from a Warren Rush. - Could you put him straight through, please? - Any relation? Yeah. He's my father. Y... Your father's alive? No, he's dead. Which is why he'll be calling from an unknown number. (sighs) What? Nothing. You just... never mentioned your father before. And you can read into that whatever you like and you'd probably be right. Understood. Oh, and, Eve, the cards, maybe linen or something and-and embossed. And, um, you know, get some for yourself as well. Like mine, but, uh, slightly... - Worse? - Yeah. ♪ ♪ MAX: It's not me, man. It's this director. He's a dick. He's from Iceland. He's Iceland-dick. - (laughs) - (sighs) Are you... are you still taking your meds? Come on, man. Of course I'm taking my meds. The meds are what got me this gig in the first place. I know that. Look at me, Rush. Look at my eyes. I'm fine. It's the last scene of the movie. All I need is one more day to finish this. This is my comeback, man. Okay? I am John Travolta right before Pulp Fiction. Are you gonna let these quacks - deny me my Royale with cheese? - Max, you got to understand, I sign you out of here, you're my responsibility. I love that. Please, man. Please, you got to help me, okay? You're the only person that can help me here. You're the only one that would. (chuckles) What time you due on set? Don't worry about set. All you got to do is get me to my manager's. - I-I don't know, man. - Do I have a bit of a temper? Yeah. - Am I a raging alcoholic? 100%. - Yeah. But, Rush, I'm not crazy. (sighs) I'm not. Ten grand. I sign you out of here, take you straight to your manager's, and the rest is up to you, okay? Cash up front. Just like we did on the last movie. I don't have ten grand cash on me. This is the loony bin. They don't even let you keep your pants. - A-All right. All right. - It's a little cold in here. (sighs) But as soon as we're out. All right. Bring it in. - Come here. - Oh. - Okay. Oh, I love you. - Yeah, get some of that. All right. - Thank you. Thank you. - Okay. - Let's go and do this. - You're the best. Handsome bastard. Oh, yeah? Yeah? Then you know what? I tell you what, you're dead to me. You understand that? Don't you ever call me again! Who was that? My ex-manager. The guy I'm taking you to? Well, we can't go to him now, can we? Jesus, Max. Oh, relax. It's all good. - Okay? I got this. Let me just make one more call. - Oh, sh... Great. Just give me a second. Katie Crawford, please. (sighs) Hey. It's Max. Yeah. Hang on one second. - She wants to talk to you. - Who? (whispers): It's my agent. Hello? - This is Katie Crawford. - Uh, I have Max with me. What would you like me to do with him? Just get him to the set tonight. What do you mean tonight? What about, like, - right now? - That's not gonna work. - Crew doesn't get there until 9:00. - Hey. You can't stick me with this guy, okay? You signed him out. Yeah, and I'll sign him back in. Dr. Rush, you get Max to set by 9:00 p.m. tonight, there'll be 25 grand waiting for you. Cash. Fine. (sighs) Just like old times, huh? Sh*** (sighs) Hello? EVE: Don't worry. - It's not your father. - Oh, thank Christ. I'm not ready for that conversation yet. What you got? The Tolkin House called. Apparently, some sort of medical emergency has arisen. Oh. What, somebody get too much wasabi in their tuna tartare? (chuckles) No. Close. Pinkeye. What? Pinkeye's not an emergency. Hey, that's what I said, but then they wired $5,000 into your account. Douglas Russel is the manager... he'll be your contact. - Enjoy. - All right. Hey. Looks like we're going to the Tolkin House. Since when are you the pretentious private club type? RUSH: Since they paid me. I kind of miss this place. What are you talking about? Oh, I got eighty-sixed here a couple years ago. - What? - It's a long story. (sighs) All right. Look, just, uh... stay there, all right? Right there. Don't move. - Dr. Rush. Douglas Russel. - Yeah. Oh, hey. We need this dealt with quickly and professionally. So I've arranged for a spa room where you can examine the, uh, - massage therapist in question. - All right. Okay. (clears throat) Can I see your tongue? Where do you want it? Just inside your mouth will be fine. Okay. All right, Tina, I'm gonna have to ask you to, uh, remove your underwear. I need to take a look at 'em. - (chuckles) - (chuckles) You're very accommodating. Thank you. You know what I was just thinking? That you felt a draft? That this would be a lot more fun if you were naked, too. Yeah. I'm, uh... I'm gonna have to treat your gonorrhea first. I have the clap? If you're happy and you know it. Sh*** What about all the other girls? Other girls? (knocking) How many, uh, massage therapists ply their trade here exactly? 15 or so. - Why? - And how many are currently running around with red eyes? Seven or eight. Oh. It's an outbreak? No. More of a whorehouse. They all have gonorrhea. Yeah. Look, I'm not judging. I don't care. But, uh, I would like to get the other girls tested and treated and make sure they're less... social - until their symptoms clear up. - Perfect. But if you want to get rid of it and stay rid of it, we're gonna have to determine who these infected girls have in common. Partner-wise. Well, the girls don't share partners. Right. Well, either way, my price just jumped. I agreed to treat pinkeye, not set up an STD clinic. I called in prescriptions for ceftriaxone and cipro in multiple doses. It'll be here in a few hours. So... I'll be back. - MAN: Will Rush. - Yeah. You're a member here? No, no. I, uh... was just doing some work. It's been a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Not long enough. How are you? I mean... looks like life's treating you well. I'm all right. I got to go. How's Eve? - Heard through some mutual friends that she works for you. - Yeah, she's fine. She's doing much better now. Send her my best, please. I'll be sure not to. Max? (phone rings) Rush, this is Katie Crawford calling. We have a little, uh, wrinkle in the plan. - How little? - Max can't show up to set unless he apologizes to Arisson first. And Arisson is...? The director. (scoffs) You're kidding. - I'm not. - He can do it on the set. He won't be allowed on set unless Arisson agrees, and he won't agree without an apology. All right, look, uh, have him meet us at the bar at the Maison Cresson in a half hour, okay? Also, FYI, uh, Max hates the guy. Yeah, I gathered. Just make sure he doesn't lose his sh*** All right. Bye. Max, come on. Let's go. Dude. What? I'm kind of in the middle of a little conquest here. - RUSH: Yeah? - Yeah. About to hit one of the massage rooms. That'd be a mistake. - Why? - Take it from me, as a man of medicine, big mistake. All right? - Ooh. - Yeah. - Got to go. - Come on. Let's go. - Max! Is it true you tried to kill yourself? - There he is! (reporters clamoring) How are you feeling today, Max? - All right... I got this. - Are you depressed? - Who are you? - I'm Max's doctor. He's fine, he's just suffering from exhaustion, okaroomte? - (phone rings) - Max, why are you depressed? Eve, this is not a great time. - It's your father. - I need some time. Oh... Fine. Uh, put him through. - EVE: You're on, Dr. Rush. - Hello? Will? Hey. How are you? Car. Now. Are you still on your meds? Well, I'm surprised to hear from you. Yeah, I can imagine. Back up. Back up. Please, guys. Well, why are you calling, Will? - Uh, I need a favor. - Come on, guys. What's all that noise? - I need a statement! - It's not a great time. Well, I'm having trouble hearing you. Yeah, yeah, I know. Can I call you back? Look, if you want to ask me a favor after all this time, it would be more respectful to do it in person, - don't you think? - Sure. Fine. Where would you like to meet? Well, why not here at the house? 6:00. For dinner. - Dinner? - Yeah. - I'm not gonna say it again. Back up, please. - Perfect. Hey, Doc, get the hell out of the way. I need - a shot of Max. - Take a hike, asshole! He was going to make an apology. And he is. Aren't you, Max? I'm getting there. I'm sorry, Martin. Do you mean it? I don't really believe you, Max. Well, you wouldn't know an honest moment if it ejaculated in your fat face. What difference does it make? What? He barely talks English. You were halfway home. You don't deserve to work with me. I stick my neck out for you. Everyone in this town, they say, "Max? Forget about him. Do not cast him in your movie!" But I say, "No, no, no, Max, I love him. He's my guy. This is my guy." What, your guy to piss on? I am an A-list director. My movies is top-grossing in Iceland. - And the studio entrust me with $100 million budget. - Yeah. Not to you but to me! - You're right. He is kind of a dick. - Yeah. Good-bye, Mr. Rush. Good-bye to... uh, whatever is left of your career, Max. - Eh? - Whoa, Max. Max, Max, Max, Max. Stop, stop, stop. - Get back, get back, get back. - You... you are done. Eh? (whooshing) Done. Ka I'm done 'cause I quit! All right, guys, guys. This means a lot to Max, okay? More than he'll admit. So... come on, how about it? Unless one of you two guys is averse to making money, surely you can get through one last scene together? No, this is done. Eh? And you... you-you are a piece of money sh*** Eh? just like Max. - Oh, I'm a piece of sh***? - Yeah. You're the director who's one scene away and can't even finish his movie. How many more $100 million movies you think you're getting after this, huh? This is a small town, my friend. People talk, trust me. So, you know, unless you're ready to go back to Iceland and make your depressing little volcano films, you're finished here. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah. Yeah? That's what I thought. When'd you stop taking your meds, hmm? I don't know. - About six weeks ago. - You lied to me. I don't need 'em anymore. You're bipolar, Max. It's relapse and remission, with a higher recurrence if left untreated. - You know that. - The pills dull me, man. It's... There's no highs and lows. It's all middles.st p And I know you know what I'm talking about. So don't even... I can't act on meds, Rush. Okay? I tried it once. I sucked. One critic said that it was like Keanu Reeves after a lobotomy. Yeah. Google that sh*** (phone dings) (sighs) What? If I'd known, I never would have signed you out. Sh*** (clears throat) Sorry, excuse me. Sorry, I'll just be, uh, one moment. - What are you doing here? - Just dropping off your meds. Why didn't you have 'em delivered? I told you... priority - today is my cards. - I already ordered the top of the line series. The Tiny Dancer. Same paper Elton John uses to publish his first editions combined with their exclusive 25-year-old German ink, and embossed in gold leaf. All for the impressively high price of $3,500. - Bam. Nailed it. - Great. Now get back to the office, I need you there. You're welcome. All right, ladies, who's first? Eve. Hey. Hey. Excuse me. Hey. Thought that was you. Here with Rush? Yeah, just, um, dropping some stuff off. - Do you have a second? - No. I got to go. Really, it'll just be a second. A minute, at most. Sure. Look, I made a lot of changes in my life since you worked for me. W... Worked for you? Really? Since we knew each other. - Okay. - I-I'm sober now. I'm in a program. I'm seeing a therapist. You know, I-I'm trying to work through my issues. Great. But Step Nine is making amends, and, well, I've been holding off on contacting you because I was pretty sure you never wanted to see me again. And then, all of a sudden, you know, there you are. (softly clears throat) I'm sorry. You know, believe it or not, I-I didn't mean to hurt you. I wasn't seeing things in... reality back then, and, uh, you know, I was... I was so messed up. Yeah, I know. Anyway, look, I don't expect you to forgive me. Anytime soon. I just... I wanted you to know that... I know that what happened was wrong. I got to go. If you ever want to talk, you know... I don't want to talk. I don't want to hear you. I don't want to see you. Why don't you forget about me like I've already forgotten about you. Alex? (coughs) It was just one. - Maybe two. - (scoffs) Okay, three. But listen, babe, I'm just under a lot of stress right now. I spoke to Rush. I told him to call his father for you. Why would you do that? Because he was dragging his feet. He's a grown-ass man. I'm a grown-ass man. That's not your place, Laurel. Look at you. Baby, you're miserable. I couldn't just sit around here - and watch you do nothing about it. - But I did do something. I spoke to Rush and everything's been handled. - It's okay. - (laughs): You sound just like him. At least I'm gonna get results. Sh*** (knocking) All right. All the girls have been treated. - I'm ready to go. - Mm. Thank you. You were as good as advertised. Yeah. There is just one last thing. Um, still need to treat the source of the outbreak. Well, it seems like we've got it all under control now, so... (chuckles) Drop your pants. I'm a married man. Oh, we'd better get your wife tested, then. Uh, no, you're way off, Doctor. Really? You know, I had some interesting chats with the girls today. They were all so surprised to learn they weren't the only other woman in your life. Drop your pants, Douglas. Or should I say, uh, patient zero? That's a boy. All right. Would a six-month membership inspire your continued discretion? - Only six months? - Oh! How about a year? Mm, I'll think about it. You know, after today, I'm not sure this place comes up to my exacting standards. Might want to take these, too. All right. Have a nice day. (sighs) Sh... Doing okay, buddy? Ever since I was a kid, I dreamt about flying. Sailing over the tops of all the buildings. Arms spread out like Superman. (soft whoop) Feel the air underneath me, like water, just holding me up. Everybody's looking at me. Who is that? He's amazing. - Max. - I should have told you about the meds thing, Rush. - It wasn't right. - Hey, hey. - (phone dings) I just... - I needed to get out of there, man. It... You know, it doesn't matter, all right? Look, I-I... I got somewhere I got to be. So c... come on, let's just hit the road. Please? You're my friend, right, Rush? Yeah, yeah. I'm-I'm your friend. Yeah. MAX: None of them are. Max, Max! - (camera shutters clicking) - Forget about them. They don't understand people like us. - They really don't, do they? - No. No, so come on, just, buddy, please, just... - step away from edge. All right? - (exasperated sigh) Why does everybody keep asking me to do that? Come on, you're gonna be late. Let's go. Let's go! Sh*** That's Max Zarella. - I used to love his movies. - Yeah? Maybe you should tell him. You're not my best client. What? I mean, you might be my favorite client, but you're not my best client. I mean you're might be my favorite, but not y best client, not by a long shot. No, my best client would not have me meet him in Brentwood. Bad place to do business... nothing but picture windows and nosy eyeballs. Xanax to take the edge off. Norco to dull the pain. And just the right amount of blow to get me back up to even. Oh, my God. All right, listen, you good? Text me later, bro. Hey. I need you to stay with Max. Two hours, tops. - Would if I could, but I got to be somewhere. - I'll pay you $5,000. - Where I'm headed, I'm clearing $10K. - Manny, come on. There's no one else, okay? Eve's not answering her phone. People count on me, all right? In my line of business, it's all about showing up. - Well, thank you very much. - Glad to meet you, man. Listen, if you need some sh***, get my number from Rush. Okay. All right, man. Nice bike. Thanks. (motorcycle engine revving) Man, you really got to be this messed up to see your dad? If I'm gonna avoid a big blowup, it's better to be numb. - Well, not in my experience. - Oh, from a guy who was about to jump off the building, 30 minutes ago. I wasn't gonna jump, man. I was trying to get to an honest place. Something that you could benefit from. (exhales) Your dad's got a nice place. Yeah, he does. All right, say as little as possible, okay? And don't do anything... Crazy? - Yeah. - I got it. - You all right? - Yeah. Hey, Dad. Hello, Will. I didn't know you were bringing a guest. No. No, neither did I. Are... you Max Zarella? I am. I used to love you... I was such a big fan... Oh. Sorry. Um, I'm Corrine. Corrine, thank you. That's very kind. Sweetheart. Why haven't you invited them in? Please, come in. - Will. - Yeah? It's really nice to finally meet you. Yeah, likewise, I'm sure. So... - where are you living these days? - Mmm. I, uh, have a suite at the Maison Cresson. Hmm. - You're living in a hotel? - Yeah. The best in Beverly Hills. Some days I can, uh, can see the ocean from my terrace. That must be lovely. What about your practice? Good. Booming. Where's your office? I... bring my office to my patients. Personalized medicine, it's a rapidly growing field. I know. I've-I've heard that. And Sarah's at UCLA? Yeah. Are you two still together? We, uh, decided to... take a break for the time being. Oh, that's a shame. But I'm sure they're keeping her busy over there. And she always could keep her priorities straight, so... Will, did you always know that you wanted to be a doctor? Um, no, actually. Uh, when I was young, I wanted to be a hot dog vendor - with my own cart. - (laughs) In a way, I guess I am. WARREN: I can tell you when I first knew Will was gonna be a doctor. Will always had an insatiable curiosity about medicine. One day, he cut himself with a circular saw. And it wasn't just a laceration... it was deep. I found him in the garage stitching up his own hand, tears streaming down his face. But his eyes, his eyes were laser-focused. I knew right then... (clicks tongue) he was a doctor. Still am. But... then he took another path. It's not another path, Dad. Hmm? Personalized medicine? Working out of the back of your car? Where else am I supposed to treat them? I mean, - I was thrown out of the hospital. - Don't tell me - you're still whining about what happened. - They're not excuses. - I was ambushed. - You were in no condition to treat patients. I did what I had to do. I was the best doctor on the floor that night, Corrine, this fish is incredible. What is that? Uh, is it black cod? It's the... first time I tried this recipe. Yeah. People always talk about the, uh, fatty acids, but the, um, B12 in black cod is off the charts. Am I right? Doctors? - It's the Omega-3. - It's both. After six years, you still can't own up to your mistakes. What was I thinking, inviting you over here tonight? I mean, I'm serious. - Let's just cut to the chase, okay? - Oh. Right. You wanted to ask me a favor. Yeah. And it's not for me. It's for Alex. He did something to help a patient of mine, and, um, it was against hospital protocol and... it's come back to bite him on the ass. - And you want me to...  - I don't know. Make some calls. Do whatever you can. That's it. You know, I was always very fond of Alex. But if Alex chose to act unethically on your behalf, he shouldn't be surprised there are consequences. And he should be man enough to accept them. Dad... I just gave you my answer, Will. It's no. - GIRL: Daddy! - Ah. WOMAN: Discúlpeme, señora. Lilly wants to say good night. Hey. I was hoping I was gonna get to meet you. Who are you? He's just a friend of Daddy's, honey. What's your name? Uh, Will. Hi, Will. Hey, Lilly. It's really nice to meet you. It's bedtime, sweetheart. Give your mom a kiss good night. Come here, baby. Mwah. Good night, sweetheart. Sleep tight. Max, we should go. WARREN: Will. Get in the car. You never told her she had a brother? Well, I was hoping to tell her tonight. Then you showed up in your... condition. Oh, there it is. WARREN: I won't let you disappoint her the way you've disappointed everyone else in your life. - I won't. - You know dad, did it ever occur to you that you disappointed me? Never. (scoffs) (sighs) Oh, uh, by the way, your wife, she barely touched her food, and, uh, what with that and the slight tremor, my guess is Adderall. You might want to look into that. Come on. - Well, so much for avoiding the big blowout. - Had to be done. God, I hope I don't blow this. You won't. Unlike the rest of us, Max, you get multiple takes at it. I'm sorry I didn't get your back at dinner. I should have jumped in there more with your old man. Don't worry about it. - (exhales) - Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Come on. You know what, I just had a crazy idea. Why don't I stay? Yeah? Watch the master at wo. I'd love that. ah? - Let's do it. - All right. There he is! The man of the hour. They're waiting for you in the makeup trailer. - Go get 'em, Max. - All right. See you after. (chuckles) - I'm Katie Crawford. - Oh. - Did you know he was off his meds? - I rep a lot of actors. It's hard to keep track who's on, who's off. But thank you. - You really came through for us. - You're very welcome. The Eagle just landed. I don't know. Some doctor. (sighs) Ever since I was a kid, I dreamt about flying. Sailing over the tops of all the buildings. Arms spread out like Superman. I can feel the air underneath me, holding me up like water. Like water. Everybody's looking at me. "Who is that? He's amazing." I don't think I want to fly anymore. I don't even want to dream. I want to live. - Cut! - A.D.: Ladies and gentlemen, that is a wrap! - (applause) - MARTIN: Everyone, huh? You are the best American crew I work with! I love you all! And you, huh? This, this was... this was sublimeness, huh? - (chuckles) - Yeah, we did it, huh? "We" did it? Hmm? "We" - did it? - Max. Yeah. We did it. - (grunts) - Max. S-Security! Security! - Security! - All right, all right. I got this, I got this. I'm Max's doctor. - He's just suffering from exhaustion. - I'm exhausted. He's exhausted! (shouting in Icelandic) That little... Had to be done. You need help. - You know that, right? - Yeah, I know. All right. - So I'll see you around? - Yeah. Yeah. Give me a call sometime when you're not in a mental institution. Or you could come stay here with me maybe. - (chuckles) - Just for observation. I'm good. Hey, Rush. Yeah. You're a great doctor, man. I don't care what your dad says. Thanks, Max. Old Warren was just jelly. Like Iceland-dick. (starts engine) Oh, I'm surprised you guys haven't met him. He's, um... he's usually hanging around. (chuckles) I see some pretty, uh, interesting things in the E.R. It... takes a certain kind of person... Hey, man. Hey. Look, Alex, I'm-I'm sorry, okay? - I tried. - What are you sorry for? I-I kind of... I-I screwed it up. What are you talking about? Your dad came through big-time. - What? - He called up my chief administrator and told him I was an exceptional doctor who deserves another chance. I'm back in, baby. Back in. - Thank you. - Oh. No problem. Ah. I know how hard that was. (chuckles) Was there ever a doubt? - You drinking? - Yeah. - All right? - Yeah. (sighs) You're still here? Not quite. It's morning. Yeah. I knew that. (sighs) Hey. Where'd you get to last night? I was calling and calling. Oh. Sorry. My phone died. - Everything okay? - Yeah. Ta-da! My new cards? - Your new cards. (laughs) - My new cards. All right. Ooh. (exhales) Wow. They're... perfect. Aren't they? Yeah, they're perfect. But not really... me. Your usual breakfast? Yeah. Double. (sighs) (grunts) (sighs)
