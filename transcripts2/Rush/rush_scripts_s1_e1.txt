Yo, McDreamy. I believe this girl's had some kind of coronary incident. Uh... heartbeat is labile, she's disoriented. I'd... keep her in the overnight for observation if I were you. And it's, um... it's possible she had a heart attack. And how would you know that? Okay. We'll admit her. Just... All right. Here. Here you go. Okay. All right. All right. Easy. Easy... Okay, this, uh... this nice man's gonna take care of you. Okay, lie down. Yep. That works, too. It's, uh, best seat in the house. Okay. Okay. I will, uh, see you tomorrow. Tomorrow? Elliot's birthday, remember? He's my son, Rush. I remember. I just didn't think that you remembered. He's my godson. How could I forget? Plus, you know, Eve puts all that stuff on my calendar and reminds me the day before, calls me the day of. This guy wouldn't know how to tie his own shoe without a detailed e-mail from his assistant. But I can perform an appendectomy with my eyes closed. Hey, he's no slouch himself. Did he tell you he finished second in his class in Harvard? He did not. Mm-hmm. You know what they say: Second place is the first loser. Will P. Rush, first in my class. Pleasure to meet you. And look at you now. Ooh... hey... I don't think you can smoke in here, sweetheart.

You're supposed to apprise me of all the new talent here in the hospital; that's what friends do. Maybe I should admit you, too. You look like shit. How much coke have you done? Spare me the moralizing, doctor. I just saved this girl's life. You got to keep an eye on this one. Mm-hmm. She's a total mess. ♪ ♪ The car's making a strange noise. I'm not a mechanic, and you're late. I'm close. Can you order me the, uh... you know, the poached eggs with wasabi oil and shiitake chutney? No, actually, you know what, just a burger. Rush, can you just turn down the music? Why? Do you got something against Debbie Gibson? Martin Hanover called. Oh. How's he doing? Better. He's finally breathing on his own. And his wife? She checked back into rehab. Come on. Hey, all my CDs are skipping. Okay. Nobody listens to CDs anymore. There's this thing-- it's called an iPod. I can install one in your car. Oh...

Did you order my breakfast? You look like shit. And you look very pretty. You didn't sleep again, did you? The human body can chronically restrict its own sleep cycle without any noticeable effects. I've tricked my neurochemical and hormonal production emission cycles to activate in my waking states, so... you know, I need less sleep than normal humans. But you are still human. You know that, right? It is so cute that you think that. I can't just give her more methadone. She needs to manage it. That's the whole point. Just write her a scrip for weed if she needs something so bad. You're prescribing marijuana to a junkie. It works, trust me. You mind? You're in my office. You're in my room. Is that it? Uh... no. Ted Cummings called. When? Couple hours ago. And you tell me now? What did he want? You shouldn't enable an asshole like that. I'm an asshole. You enable me every day. You're not like him, Rush. It's all degrees, baby. We don't scream, we don't discriminate, we don't judge. I'm not a shrink, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a priest, I'm not a cop. We treat people who pay. And Ted Cummings pays. Where's my socks? Took a while. She drank my juice. She drank your juice. Doc, that juice is hand-squeezed by a Tibetan monk and imported daily from Nagchu. Keeps me centered. I've been in this goddamn slump for weeks now. I'm sorry, but that stuff gets to a ballplayer. They all say it don't, but it does. Yeah? Well... that is gonna cost you 15 grand. Right. Okay. You could have at least taken off your rings. I know, Doc. I know. Those are World Series rings. You win them, you leave them on. It's just what you do. There ain't gonna be no next time, Doc. I'm gonna get this thing under control. Yeah, I just wanted to call you personally and tell you to count me in for $100K.

It's "Cummings"-- two Ms, not one. All right, now. Can I give you some advice? Don't drink his juice. Sorry I'm late, bro. Avoid the 405. Shit is backed up for miles. Uh... what do you want today, bro? Same shit? Same shit. Okay. Steady and precise, like an egg timer. You cook eggs, bro? That's all I cook, man. My doctor's got me on a paleo diet, like, preagricultural and whatnot. Like, what cavemen eat. Yeah... Oh, bro, I was thinking, too, most people I see, they buy an eight ball from me in the afternoon, next thing you know, I'm getting a call at midnight asking me for more shit. But not you, bro. You know, you, you got, uh, discipline. You know, I... I respect it. It's admirable. Homeostasis. Homey, what? It's the property of a system-- in this case, the human body-- which regulates its internal environments so as to maintain a stable constant condition. Some systems just need a little more help than others. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Can I ask you a question, Manny? Yeah. Sure. You still giving Ted Cummings steroids? Hell, no, bro.

Sarah Peterson? I mean... God, how did I mess that up? Well, somehow you found a way. That was rhetorical. I was a kid. You were 30. Barely. No, no. No, no. I-I remember now. Sh-She was judgy. She had all these... she had all these rules, you know. I don't want to take my shoes off every time I go in a house. Shoes? Who cares? Take off your shoes-- it's okay. People take off their shoes.

Well, you're like Paxil, I'm like Thioridazine. Oh. Each one functions fine on its own. Once or twice, you can take them together. Might even... catch a pretty good buzz.

What, you think I keep that kind of money lying around the house? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bloom. I believe my assistant informed you that we require cash in advance before we render any medical assistance, so... Buddy... why don't you look around the room? This is Baccarat Crystal.

Just, I don't know, say I'm out of town or something. Hold on. Who is she? I've never heard you talk like this before. My first love. My only love, unless you count that night in Belize, but I'm fairly certain that was the Vicodin talking. Rush, are you sure this is... such a good idea? Well, I don't know. You sure it's such a good idea to go out with a guy who dry-cleans denim? I mean, it seems a little compulsive. Okay, good-bye. Enjoy your date. Yeah. You, too. You okay? Me? Yeah, sure, I'm fine. Fine. ♪ ♪ Nice skirt. Must be really popular. I've seen a lot of girls wearing it tonight. Oh... I get it. The whole compliment that's really an insult... from that pickup book. It's supposed to make me feel, like, a little insecure. Supposed to make me long for your approval. Yeah... I don't want your approval. You should try that crowd down there at the end of the bar. They seem a little more your speed. Not as well-read. Bye-bye. You make that look easy. Yes, I do have a knack for repelling men. What can I get for you? Oh, just a glass of Shiraz. Thank you.

Yes, please. ♪ ♪ It was right after I took the MCAT. Mm-hmm. You swept me off to Costa Rica. Oh.
