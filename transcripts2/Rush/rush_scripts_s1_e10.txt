 Sweetheart, why haven't you invited them in? I'm Corrine. We know what happened, though. We were both there, we did it. We'll always know what happened. Emily Chase, Chief of Pediatrics. You ever consider coming back to the hospital? - Not once. - Too bad. - Will, I have to tell you something. - You have cancer? The ovaries come out next week. Today, I'm looking at sperm donors. Did you ever consider that it might be good for Eve to forgive me? Damn!

 I don't, I don't know about a gun. I mean, just in case you need to get unstuck. Bitch! If I wanted a baby, and nothing more, then, I would rather do it with a stranger. But if it's gonna be with you, I want a life together. Hey. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. I have a proposal. Okay. Your surgery is a week away. You're gonna be laid up for a while afterwards, so, I propose - that we take a trip. - When? Leave tonight, come back next Thursday. You'll be all rested, ready to recover. Tanned. - Tanned? - Mm-hmm. Where-where would we go? - Bora Bora? - Oh. The last time you suggested a trip to Bora Bora, it didn't go well. I know. You didn't show up for the flight, I had to come find you, we ended up - getting in a big fight. - I know. - We didn't even end up going. - I know, and it was all my fault, so let me make it up to you. Come on, Sarah, I want a chance to do this properly, okay? We can start over. Please? Okay. - Really? - Okay. Great! We leave tonight, 10:00 p.m. - What? You already booked the tickets? - Mm-hmm. And the bungalow, and the spa treatments. - It's all taken care of. - When did you do all this? In the past three hours. - So, you just assumed that I'd say yes? - No. I assumed that my charms would be impossible to resist. - That is a completely different thing. - Oh, okay. Mm. Eve. Hello? I'm sorry to bother you so late. You okay? Not really. Where are you? I'm at the bar. Downstairs. I'll be right down. Eve? Did somebody hit...? What happened, Eve? What...? I killed J.P. I want you to tell me exactly what happened, okay? And start from the beginning. He came to my apartment. And he forced his way in. He tried to... rape me. And I shot him. You shot him? With whose gun? Mine. I got it from Manny. Okay. Did you call the police? No. Eve, he tried to rape you. - It was self-defense. - No. I... I wanted to kill him. Hello? Hey, Rush. Hey, J.P. - Sync and corrected by TheDelta - - www.addic7ed.com - You're alive. That's a shame. So, you heard about our little incident, huh? Yeah. Look, I gonna need you to come over here and patch me up, pal. Well, I'd rather wait and see if you bleed out. You don't come, I go to the police. And I tell them that she set me up, lured me over to her apartment, and she tried to murder me. I can't believe this is happening. All right. All right, I'll be right over. I just should kill you right now. Nah, you don't have the stomach for it. No, you're right. I'm not like you. There's two sides to every story. - Not this one. - Yeah? The way I see it, Eve invited me over there for a reconciliation. Turned out to be a trap. You see, I got the wound to prove it. And the gun with her fingerprints all over it. And if you really thought that version would hold up in court, then you wouldn't have asked me over here. And if you really thought Eve could handle a trial where everything she'd ever done had been dragged out into the light, you wouldn't be here. Off the wagon, huh? Oh. I've seen you put down bigger bags than that right there at that goddamn table. It was good times, huh? How did we let some girl mess that up? Some girl? Don't stick your nose in other people's business. That was your rule, remember? Yeah. Why'd you take her away from me? She wanted to change her life. Why the hell do you care? Let's just say I can relate. Now, I'm gonna take out that bullet, and I should give you something for the pain, but you know what? I really don't feel like it. Fire away. Hurts, yeah? Good. Morning, baby. - Hey. - Hey. - You're going to the gym? - Yeah. I got to get my butt back for Mexico. Mm, looking pretty damn good to me, woman. I'm gonna go buy those airline tickets today. Did you deposit that cash? Yeah, I did. A few days ago. I wanted it gone so we wouldn't spend it on something else. - You know? - So smart. - I will be back before you leave for work. - Mm. - Cabo, here we come? - On our way. I want the gun. Yeah, I'll bet you do. Call it my insurance policy. Eve goes to the cops, I give them the gun with her fingerprints on it. It stays with me. Does it ever bother you when you look in the mirror, and you see what a piece of shit you've become? You tell me. As long as I'm alive, you come near her again... I'll kill you. Hey, man, what's up? You still good for that five grand we talked about? - Yeah, sure. When do you need it? - Today, cash. Laurel's buying the Cabo tickets. I really need that, bro. It's fine, man. I get it. Uh... can you meet me at the hotel bar? I'm on my way there right now. Okay, cool. Thanks. It's all there. - Dude, you're a lifesaver. - I just hope it gets you off the hook. Listen, you know I'm good for this. - I'll get it back to you. - I'm just glad you caught me now, 'cause I am leaving town tonight. Where you going? - Bora Bora. - Round two? - She gave me another chance. - Wow. I'm thrilled. I'm thrilled. I... But is Sarah ready to accept, you know, your lifestyle? God, no. That's why I'm gonna go see Emily Chase about a job. For real? You'd come back to the hospital? I'm following up today. And then, I can lay out the whole new life to Sarah when I propose. You know, the girl, the ring, the job. Wow. Wow. But... - why now, all of a sudden? - Honestly? Sarah really didn't want to have a kid with me. And I want to be someone she can say "yes" to. You know? Here I am borrowing money to pay off my blackmail blowjob. This shit is turned upside down for real. Ain't that the truth. Listen, I got to get to work. Hey, man, this is good news. - Oh, man. - Thank you, brother. - I'm proud of you. - Thank you. I'm gonna get this back to you. - Hey. - Hey. What happened? Well, lucky for you, you're a terrible shot. He'll live... unfortunately. I'm-I'm so sorry that I got you involved in all this. Don't. Don't apologize. I've been involved since the day we met. So, um... am I in trouble? Well, he's not going to the police. That's good, right? But he's keeping the gun. To make sure you don't go, either. How are you feeling? Well, my cheek's a little sore, but other than that, I'm all right. Thanks. Yeah. Where's Sarah? She said she'd meet you later, at the doctor's office. She went home to pack. She told you about the trip. Yeah. You arranged all that yourself? My helplessness is a habit, Eve. It's not a birth defect. Sorry. So, um, how are you getting to the airport? Or maybe it is. Shit I'll handle it. - No. No, no, no. - No, no, Rush, please, I really need something to take my mind off this. Okay? I'll handle it. Okay. Yeah, great, thank you. Uh, we need to be at Million Air by, uh, 10:00pm. Private jet? Mm-hmm. But it's got to be back by noon tomorrow. Modern luxury. Got it. Thank you. Thank you. - Will Rush. - Rush! - Max? - Yeah. I'm at the Harper. I'm in room 420. Okay? You got to come here. Max, it's very nice to hear your voice, but I don't care where you are. No. No, listen to me. You have to come. I'm serious, okay? I did a really stupid, stupid thing, man. What did you do, Max? I don't know, man. It's my girl. Just... You got to help me, here. Max, what did you do? I think I killed her. - Max. Hey, hang tight. - Come on. - What happened? - I don't know. I think she had, like, an embolism or something. Oh, an embolism? Really? What makes you think that, Max? You didn't happen to inject this lovely young lady with anything, did you? Well... well... Okay, actually, I did, but it was just saline. Okay? I'm prepping for a part. Look, I'm 93 days sober. I haven't polluted this body with anything but antidepressants. Occasional pint of Chunky Monkey. Well, there's no mill wheel murmur, so it's not an embolism. What else does she do, Max, besides saline? Uh... Hydrocodone? Oxycodone? Oh, my God, you're so good. Yes and yes. Did she ever take any of your meds? Wh... uh... I gave her a couple this morning. All right? She was feeling down. And there it is. Okay. Is that bad? Why'd you inject her with saline? I've got this screen test later this afternoon with Danny Boyle, okay? He's my favorite director. And he's doing this, you know, medical movie and I'm up for the George Clooney doctor type of guy. Of course you are. We were pretending that she was in diabetic shock and I had to, you know, like, heal her. Right, well, I applaud your ambitions, but your fictional healing powers leave a lot to be desired. - What is that? - Smelling salts. This is what happens when you give antidepressants to a pill junkie; she kind of shuts down. - Genius. - All right. What's her name? Marika. Marika? Marika, hey. - Hey, hey. - Hey. - Who are you? - Hi, sweetie. I'm the Ghost of Christmas Future, Marika, and I'm here to deliver a message: Don't mix Oxys and SSRis, okay? - Okay. - Let's get her on the bed. All right. Okay, sweetie, up. Here we go. All right. Now, you're gonna be okay, Marika. You just need to drink a lot of water, have a cold shower, okay? And lay off the pills. - Okay. Thank you. - All right. - Oh, I thought I lost you. - Max, what do I say? Uh, break a leg. Oh, uh... hey, wait a second. - What? - Let me come with you. You just blew my mind with that Zoloft-Oxy interdrug thing. I mean, the way you delivered that... it was so real. That's because it is. I know. I love it. You're like this authentic-sounding fountain of shit Just, please, okay? My audition, it's not till 4:00. Let me just come along and ask you some questions. - Please... - No, no. Max, I'm about to go shopping for an engagement ring, okay? Not giving a crash course on how to be a fake doctor. - Hang on, you're getting married? - Hopefully. I think I'm gonna throw up. Oh, bathroom, baby. This is great. Guess what? - What? - I got a guy. Shlomo. - Shlomo? - Yeah. He's sold me every engagement ring I ever bought. How many have you bought? Five. Please? Please? Come on. Let me just come along and listen to you talk. Shlomy'll give you a ridiculous deal, I promise. All right, okay, but we got to go now, okay? - Yeah? - All right. Yeah. Miks, I'll be back, okay? Hey, don't slip. - Just get out! - She's fine, right? - Yeah, she'll be fine. - Okay. I love this. So who's the lucky girl? Hey, you've reached Manny, you know what to do. Manny, it's Eve. I need you to come over to Rush's. Like, now. It's an emergency. That being said, you've got to exude confidence and empathy. - You know? - Right here. Should I write this down? I don't know, would that help? Maybe not. Okay, what about the... the whole physical stuff, you know? Your behavior. How do you engage the patient, you know, your shtick? - My shtick? - Yeah. I don't know, uh, gentle hand on the shoulder, l-lots of eye contact and no fast moves. You got to remember, you're the last person standing between these people and their fear of death. So, be still. Ooh, you see? That is gold. That's the essence. I love it; it's so simple. Max. Just being still. - I love this. - I know. All right. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Can I offer you a glass of champagne? - Oh, thank you. - You're very welcome. - And for yourself? - Thank you. - Mr. Adana will be with you in a moment. - All right. Cheers. Uh, sober? Eh, special occasion. - Hm. - Max. Shlomy! Oh, long time. What, are you getting married again? Me? No. Oh, never again. But this sucker is. My buddy, Dr. Rush, Shlomo. Hey. How you doing? - Nice to meet you. - So... how long have you been with this special woman? This time? Two weeks. But we have a long, rich history that goes back many years, that I'm hoping this ring will help her forget. So what are you looking for? A solitaire? Multi-stone? - Or maybe something, uh, halo style? - Yeah. I have absolutely no idea. Huh. Tell me about her. Tell me her name. Sarah. So tell me about this Sarah. All right. God, where to start? Um, she's... she's beautiful... obviously... She's intelligent. Sensible. Wild. She's serious, funny, sensitive, tough, she's... I-I don't know. She's... She's everything. Yeah, to me, I guess, she is. She's-She's everything. I've got a ring for you. All right. Okay. Be still. Max... Here. That's it. That's the one. You know the lady's ring size? - Yeah. Four point five. - Perfect. I'll call you when it's done. All right, thank you. I'll give you my card. Shlomo... mazel tov. You see? This was perfect. I'm gonna kill the audition with my confident stillness and empathy, both, and you... you just got the perfect ring. - Hang on. - What? Maybe I should I ask Marika to marry me, too. No, you should ask Marika to forget your name and phone number. Now, come on, Max, get in! I got a meeting at the hospital, - got to drop you off first. - All right, all right. She's really not that bad, man. I mean, she knows everybody, she's super-hot, right? Yeah, and she's not good for you. Max, you need to be with someone that makes you better, not... not worse. Yeah, you're probably right. All right, what's next at the University of Rush? Nothing. You just graduated. What?! I'm taking you home. Dr. Rush. Hey. The nurse told me you were you up here. Yeah, it's been that kind of a day. Yeah, for me, too. In spades. That baby you saved is doing well. Great, that's... that's great. Is that why you wanted to see me? No. No, I... C-Can I... Please. All right. Um... Yesterday you-you asked me about coming back to the hospital, and I was wondering if there's a position, then I want it. There is an opening. But... here's the thing. I mentioned you yesterday to the board... they have to approve everyone at that level... and someone said no. Who? Your father. Will? Where are you right now? Brentwood Park. Lily's soccer game's just getting going. Why? I'll be there in an hour. - Hey. - Hey. Wow. You're on time. Yeah, it's the new me. Just so you know... they're running 30 minutes behind. No problem. Is there somewhere else you need to be? No. No, no, I'm good. Really? All right, look... there's one more loose end I got to tie up before tonight, but it's a surprise. Listen, there is no law that says that we need to go on this trip today. If you want to put it off, - it's fine. If it's too hectic... - No. No. Sarah, absolutely not. In precisely five hours and 57 minutes, we are starting our new life together, okay? All right. I like the sound of that. Yeah. But, seriously... I've got this. It's a blood test. You should go do whatever you have to do. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. All right, okay. Thank you. - All right, see you later on. - Okay. Some asshole in a Range Rover just hit me. Right? Didn't even apologize. I hate Beverly Hills. What happened to you? That guy hit you? The one you told me about? Manny... I shot him. You're shiting me. You killed him? No. But he's keeping the gun as an insurance policy, so that I don't go to the police. Damn. I'm sorry. I wasn't... I wasn't thinking, and I-I just... I ran. It was... No, hey, I'm-I'm glad you had it with you. It's just... I got to get it back. Way to go! Hey. So, what's so urgent that this couldn't keep? Just spoke to Emily Chase about coming back to the hospital. - Really? - Yeah. It turns out you have, too. Well, you always seemed so proud of your... outsider status. Yeah, well, it's time for a change. I want that job, Dad. Well, as administrator, I have to do what's best for the hospital. And how am I not what's best? A year from now, they're gonna be doing random drug testing on all employees. I can't bring a physician with a known substance abuse problem into my hospital. You want to test me? Just tell me when and where. Look, Dad, please, I want that job. Don't press me, Will. All right! All right! Way to win, girls! I'm not pressing you, Dad. I'm just... asking for your help. Are you sure this is what you want? I'm sure. All right. I'll call Emily Chase today. Thank you. Good job, honey. Good job. Beautiful game. Just... great game. You were fantastic. Will might be rejoining the staff at Mt. Cypress. Really? Yeah. If it all works out. That's wonderful. And we have some good news of our own, don't we, Corrine? Warren... Mommy has a baby in her tummy. Really? - We're due in March. - March. Have you guys been trying? No. We didn't even think it was possible. Right. Well... congratulations. That's... - awesome. - Good to see you, Will. Yeah. Something... Anything... Geez... Shit Ah, yes, bingo! What are you? Oh, whatever. Hello? Dr. Rush? The ring for this Sarah, who is your everything, is ready. Great. That's... that's great. I'll be right over. No, no. Come on. You can do this. - You got the tickets? - No, I, uh... I got held up. I'll get 'em tomorrow. Can we talk for a minute? I got something to tell you. Okay. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. I want you to know up front there is no reason or excuse, not one. If there's anything wrong, it's me, because... I'm so damn stupid. What are you trying to say? When I went to that crazy Boss Nova party with Rush. I was out of my element and something happened. Something happened? What does that mean? I let this girl... go down on me. You "let" her? Like she needed to give some married man a blowjob and you just raised your hand? It was just one time. I swear. - Is that all? - Yeah. That's the only thing that happened. I'm sorry. Are you sorry because you betrayed our marriage or are you sorry because this Steffi was gonna out you? Yeah. She was just here. Shit - Listen, baby... - Just... That woman came to our house. You put your family at risk. - Damn it, Alex, we have a child. - I know. I was in over my head. You did everything that you could so I wouldn't find out. You paid this woman. You threw away a decade of marriage. I love you. And I'll spend the rest of my life trying to regain your trust, if you'll just give me another chance. I fell in love with an honest man. One our son could look up to. - Now all I see is a liar. - That's not who I am. - No? N... - No. You had so many chances to come clean. And you didn't take 'em. I don't know if I can ever trust you again. You need to move out. I'm gonna go and pick up our son. Do not be here when I get back. All right. Dr. Zarella. Did you get the part? It's not Max. It's me. Marika? Aw, shit Really, Marika? What did he take? He took these. Datura? Oh, God. We were just trying to have some fun. Well, lucky for you, I'm the only doctor in Beverly Hills who carries physostigmine. Oh, God. I got to get out of here. I can't handle this, okay? Tell Maxie I'm sorry. Jesus, Maxie, what were you thinking, huh? Come on, buddy. Oh, Jesus, Max, not today, please. Max... Oh, God, that feels so good. Don't stop. Did you get the ring? Yeah... Yeah, I got the ring. Did you get the part? Yeah, I got the part. We make a great team, huh? Can you do that rubby thing again? How close did I come to dying? You were on the razor's edge, which is nothing to be proud of. Hey, I'm sorry, man. Look, I got the part in the room. She wanted to celebrate; she was like, "What's the point of winning if you can't get all messed up?" And she bailed, huh? Yeah, she bailed. What do you want me to say? I mean, she's bad news. - You were right. - Max, I don't want to be right. I just want... I just want a different life. Well, don't be too different. A different you might not take my calls. - Right. - Listen, do me a favor, take her blow with you. I don't want to have that around, you know? Yeah. Of course. Hey, maybe when this movie goes into production, you could be, like, a medical consultant. Yeah, well, hopefully I'll be unavailable, but, uh, thanks for thinking of me. Take it easy, bud. Associate producer. Hey, Rush. What? Be still. You be still. Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. I booked the limo. They're gonna pick you up at Sarah's at 9:00. Right. Thank you for doing that. I need a drink. A double. You want one? Eve? Eve? How long has this been going on? - All night. - All right, - I'm gonna... - No, Rush, - stop. - I'm just gonna talk to him. No. You're about to go on a trip with the love of your life. I'm not gonna... have you mess that up because of me. Please. I'm not gonna mess it up. I'm just gonna talk to him. Got a plane to catch, remember? J.P.? You saw my texts. I knew you'd come back, Rush. So predictable. Yeah. Well, that makes two of us. Well, it's like you said. Right? As long as you're alive, I can't come near her. You really think you're gonna get away with this? Huh? You just wouldn't let it go. You broke into my house, and you tried to kill me. It was self-defense. Help me. Help me. Help me, please. Oh, God. Ple-Please don't let me die. Don't let me die! Help. Oh, shit, bro. What are you doing here, Manny? Oh, God... I came for this, okay? Hey, Rush, Rush. You're good. Come on. Oh, Rush, this isn't you... this isn't you. Well, then, I guess you really don't know me. Rush. Come on, bro. Just get out of here. Hey, listen to me. You don't understand. Get out of here, Manny. Just go! Oh, shit Hey! Hey, I'm on my way. I'm just... I'm just running a little late. Oh, no, it's fine. Um, I decided to come to you. Are you at the hotel? No, I'm... I... Actually, you know what? Why don't you, uh...? Why don't you just have him take you straight to Million Air? Oh, okay. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. I'll meet you there. Everything okay? Yeah... no, everything's fine. I... I'm just handling some last-minute stuff. You know, it's... I can't wait to see you. I can't wait to see you, too. Um, okay, I'll see you there. Yeah. Bye. What happened? Are you shot? Here, let me help you. No, I got this. He won't be bothering you anymore. What does that mean? You can go home now. What does that mean, Rush? Exactly what I said. He won't be bothering you anymore. I packed your bag. You don't want to be late. Thank you. All right. You told her? Yeah. All right, come on, you need a place to stay. Just while you're away until I find a place of my own. Yeah, yeah, that's... that's fine. The, uh... the mini bar's full, and room service is all on me. - But I-I got go. - No, no. Go. Go. Find happiness, Rush. Yeah, I'm-I'm trying. All right, bud. Safe trip. It's gonna be ok man. Too bad about that broken tail light, huh? That gun was recently fired. You want to tell me what happened? Don't know anything about it. Possession of the gun violates your probation, so you know you're going to County tonight. I know. Who'd you shoot, Manny? I didn't shoot anyone. I didn't even fire that gun. Corrine? Big day today. Yeah... for all of us. Listen, Corinne, I am about to get on a plane, so... It's yours. What? What's mine? The baby. How do you know that? It's yours, Rush. Oh, shit Well, you showed up. Yeah. Hi. I showed up. Okay, so, I read about this boat tour. We can take it to some small islands, we can have dinner on the... Sarah, listen, there's something I have to say. All this work I've been doing recently... it's just to try and become... the type of man that you could love. You did it. That man is standing right here. No, just... wait. Now, I can take a lot, but what I could never take is knowing that I have ruined your life. What are you talking about? I really wanted to change. You have changed, Will. - You've changed. - No. My life... and this has never been more clear than today... my life is never gonna be perfect. Are you... are you telling me - you don't want to go on this trip? - No. What I'm saying is... that we can't be together. No. You are full of shit - You need to be with someone... - Will... who makes you better, not worse. I have seen the changes you have made, and they are real. I've done too much... and I'll never be able to leave it behind. What happened? Huh? Will? What happened?! Will you just talk to me?! Will you just be honest and tell me? I can't. This is it. There's not gonna be another chance. I know. Okay. You're a coward. Just... just give me a minute, okay?
