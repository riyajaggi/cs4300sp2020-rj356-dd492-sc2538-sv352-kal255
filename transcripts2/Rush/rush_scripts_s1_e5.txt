 - Previously on Rush... - You saw J.P. there? What did he say? He was just trying to apologize. Stay away from him, all right? Why would I want to go anywhere near him? I'm just saying, stay away. I need some help. I need blood. No way. No, I'm not doing that. I've been suspended. Look, I'm going to need you to call your dad. Let's just cut to the chase, okay?

 Right, you wanted to ask me a favor. Yeah, and it's not for me. It's for Alex. My dad here? No. I helped you out, Will. I fought with him all night long after you left just to get him to make that call. RUSH: And why would you do that? CORRINE: Because Warren Rush shouldn't get his way every time, - should he?  - RUSH: Certainly not. - (knocking) - Oh. Go away. (knocking) Will?

 Corrine. Hold on. Hey. What are you doing here? May I come in? Yeah. What time is it? It's early. I'm sorry, I didn't know where else to go. Can I have some vodka? Uh, yeah. Sure. All right, what-what's going on? Your father knows. He knows what, exactly? That we slept together. And he found that out how? - I told him. - (knocking) Does he know that you came here? Did you tell him that, too? - (knocking continues) - No. Good morning, Dr. Rush. Are you planning on staying here? I didn't know where else to go. Where do you want me to put the beautiful lady's luggage, Dr. Rush? Arturo, this is my stepmother. Arturo, Corrine. Corrine, Arturo. Thank you very much. That'll be all. Thank you. All right... why did you tell him? - He knew. - How did he know, Corrine? That doesn't make any sense. Because of how I've been acting lately. He asked me if there was somebody else. - Well, then, you should have lied. - I did. But he could tell, Will. You know him. Yeah, I-I-I don't understand. What... my name just came up? Not at first. But then he was hammering me with the names of all of his friends. People that we know. And-And I denied all of it. And, then, what... then they just brought up me? In the end, yes. - Why? - Because I talk about you a lot. He's mentioned it before. - That you talk about me a lot? - Yes. He thinks I'm on your side. I'm sorry, I... I couldn't hide it. (knocking) Are you sure that he doesn't know that you came here? I-I don't see how he could. (knocking) Hello? Who is it? Dad? (gunshot) (gasping) - Good news. - Talk to me. Well, unlike every other quarter when you come in for a physical, it's actually good you came in this time. I finally found something wrong with you. Which proves you're human. See? Good news. Well, what's the matter? - Pancreatitis? Aplastic anemia? - Easy, big fella. It's nothing exotic. - Well, what's the matter with me? - Well, for starters, your blood pressure's surprisingly elevated. - How high? - Well 17/10. And then there is some sinus tachycardia and your QRS is mega-wide. Bullshit. See for yourself. Having trouble sleeping? Not when I take a pill. Having feelings of panic or dread? Well, I am now. What are you getting at? All of your symptoms point to one thing, Rush. Enlighten me. Anxiety. (laughs) What? Something happen recently? - No. - Seems like something's happened. Nothing's happened. - Anxiety's not to be taken lightly, Rush. - (groans) - And, look, I'm saying this as your friend. - I'm not taking anxiety lightly. I'm not experiencing anxiety. - Your body says otherwise. - Well, then my body - must be lying. - Okay, then you know what, you need to have a talk with your body and tell it to take a day off. Doctor's orders. (sighs) (whispers) Kenny. Come here. A little early for you, isn't it, Dr. Rush? Yeah, I know, I'm taking the day off. Crazy, right? I always thought you were like a shark. Got to keep moving. Always moving. Yeah, well, today's the exception that proves that rule. I see Jordana Rourke is staying here again. Yeah. Her movies are so violent. Yeah. Uh, d-do you know is she's, uh, traveling alone this weekend? No, but I can always ask... No, no, no, no. That's fine, that's fine. I can, um... actually risk it. (clears throat) You know the drill. Hey. Will Rush. I was wondering how long it would take you to come over and say hi. Well, I was waiting for an invitation. You, uh, want to get out of this hot sun? Is it always that easy for you? With most women, unfailingly. With you, not quite yet. I always have liked your confidence, Rush. You got a tux? Do I? Midnight blue, just like the one Daniel Craig wore in Skyfall. Get a new one. Black. Tom Ford. You're taking me to my premiere tonight. Am I? Lucky me. We'll see. Meet me in the lobby. 6:30. Sharp. All right. Bye, Rush. CORRINE: Warren Rush... shouldn't get his way every time, should he? Should I bring this to Ms. Rourke's room or yours? Neither. Put it on ice. I don't want a day off. - Uh, why not? - 'Cause you were right, Kenny. I'm a shark. Just got to keep moving. - Sync and corrected by TheDelta - - www.addic7ed.com - (door opens) You're late. I can't be late. It's my day off. I'm not even supposed to be here. What do you need? Who are the flowers from? They're not for you? No. No. I'm assuming they're from young Lucas. But, come on, let's see what he has to say. You didn't read this? - Course not. I have boundaries. - Mm, no, if you had boundaries, you wouldn't bring me in on a Sunday. - Is that why you called me in here? - No, no, I-I just need something to do. What's the matter? Nothing. I just need to be occupied. Well, there's always Yurt. - What's Yurt? - It's a tech start-up. They make a haptic interface that allows you to manage - your home devices remotely. - It's part of this whole "Internet of Things" thing. Okay, well, let's first pretend I understood anything you just said. Then, - let me ask you... how do you know all that? - Um, 'cause I read. Anyway, they've been calling you for weeks, and I told them that you don't do the whole retainer thing, but they... Fine, fine. Tell 'em I'm on my way. It's Sunday. They might not actually be... - Just text me where to go. Ooh, wait. - I'll do. - What? - I have to know what's in that - card before I go. - (chuckles) Yeah, what this card says - is none of your beeswax. - This is my residence, Eve, I'm legally liable for whatever's inside that envelope. Open it. Come on. Fine, fine. What? They're from J.P. Here. "Sorry if I took you by surprise. I totally get it. Peace, J.P." - All right, I'm calling him... - No. - Well, what do you want me to do? - You... can do nothing. It's fine. I'll handle it. Well... at least let me throw these away. No, n-no, just leave them. They're beautiful. I'm not gonna let one man's psychosis keep me from enjoying nature's beauty, especially when someone else has denied me the pleasure of Japanese pottery on my day off. Go. - You sure? - I am sure for sure. I'm so sure. Just go, get out of here. All right. All right. Oh, and, uh, I need you to buy me a new tux... black, Tom Ford, for tonight? Mr. Valchek, you have a fecal impaction. You know what that means? - Yeah. I can't shit. - Bingo. And if you don't get the fecal matter out of there, you run the risk of perforating your colon. (groaning) Oh. (sighs, groans) Geez. Knock yourself out. Where are the non-sterile gloves? The long ones. Here you go. Thanks. Can I talk to you for minute? Please. Mr. Valchek, you can rest a minute. I'll be waiting. (groaning) (Valchek groans loudly) They got you in the doghouse over this whole missing blood thing, huh? You know about that? Are you kidding? Did you really steal the blood to save a gang member's life? I guess I did. And now I get every shit patient that walks through the door. Literally. Well, for what it's worth, all the nurses think you did the right thing. We used to call you Dr. Khaki Pants, but now you're Dr. Dangerous. Dr. Dangerous? I like it. So, what's up? My brother just got diagnosed with stage three pancreatic cancer. But there's a new medication called Eloxifin. It doubles the five-year survival rate. Yeah, I read about it, but it's not approved in the U.S. I know. I was wondering... after how the whole blood thing went down and all... if you had any... connections? (sighs) Look, first of all, I don't have those kind of connections, and even if I did... I'm sorry. It's okay. I just... I had to ask. I just got reinstated. - RUSH: So, you guys need a doctor? - We do, yes. Well, I don't normally take clients on a retainer basis. Yeah, your assistant told us. Right, yeah, well, I... I heard what you guys were up to down here, and I thought, "You know what? Why not make an exception?" Oh, you have an interest in haptics? - Uh, yeah. - Cloud technology? Big time, yeah. Bring it. (laughter) (clears throat) So, should we talk money? Let's. Okay. We're prepared to offer... - $10,000. - $10,000 a month. Ten? Right. Uh... well, I was thinking something more in the neighborhood, of, uh... 20. Welcome to the Yurt. Perfect. So, where do I start? I mean, uh, since I'm on the clock now. Oh, I don't think we have any medical issues at the moment. We rarely do, actually. What? I-I don't get it. No one ever gets sick, but you need a doctor? Why? Facebook has a doctor, Google has a clinic. And now we have you. We'll call you if we need you. Yurts. ♪ I keep forgettin' ♪ ♪ We're not in love anymore ♪ ♪ I keep forgettin' ♪ ♪ Things will never be the same again ♪ ♪ I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear ♪ ♪ I keep forgettin' it all ♪ ♪ Every time you're near ♪ ♪ Every time I see your smile ♪ (phone ringing) ♪ Hear your hello ♪ ♪ Saying you can only stay a while... ♪ Please tell me you have a client. You just saw dozens of clients. Yurt? Yeah, I saw two nerds and a bouncy house. Okay, well, I'm pleased to offer you a full-scale medical emergency. Oh, finally! I will text you the address. Bye. No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait! I just negotiated a huge payday at Yurt. $20,000 a month. Yeah, I thought you'd be proud. Please tell me you got stock options. Yurt could be the next Google. Google's in-house masseuse, whose starting salary was $400 a week, is now a multi-millionaire. Do you know why? She got stock options. Well, I should definitely be earning more than a Google masseuse. That's what I'm saying. So, let me see if I can up the ante to stock options, and if I can, we'll split them 50-50. Uh, 80-20. 60-40. 70-30! Rush, it is my day off, and I am shopping for tuxedoes. All right, fine! 60-40. Bye. (sighs) Bye. All right, so, uh, what seems to be the problem? You'll have to see for yourself. Mrs. Atchison? Dr. Rush is here to see you. Thank you. Mrs. Atchison, how can I help? The worms are back. - Worms? - Yes, worms. Where? On my arm. Are you blind? Oh, may I...? Yes. All right. Okay. Um, you know, I'm-I'm sorry, I can't see anything - on your arm, let alone worms. - They're underneath the skin. Purple things? Moving? Look. Yeah. Um... would you excuse me for just one second? Okay. Hey, so, um, here's the deal. She's suffering from a psychosomatic condition known as Morgellons Syndrome. She needs a shrink. Her psychiatrist is out of town, I had to do something. (sighs) Um, Mrs. Atchison, I'm sorry. You're going to have to find someone else to do this. You're not going to take them out? Well, I'm-I'm not qualified to perform this kind of procedure. No one understands. No one. Right. Well, yeah, I'm-I'm... I'm sorry. I-I have to go. But if you don't take them out, it'll just get worse. I'm sorry. (sighs) (phone ringing) What? (sighs) (phone chimes) (sighs) Hey, it's me. Yeah, I need some tickets, man. Today? Yeah. Dead tickets. - Dead tickets? - RUSH: Yeah. Indica, Zen weed. Total downer pot. Whoa, whoa, whoa, I got you, bro, but you got to come to me, all right? I'll text you the address. What? Well, why can't you come to the hotel? Sunday, bro. It's my day off. - What?! - MANNY: Day off. A day where you don't work. You should try it some time. Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will one day. Just not today. (phone ringing) Hello. I changed my mind. Oh. It's you. About what? I'm going to wear a different dress. Great. Thanks for the update. It's not just an update, Rush. You're gonna have to get a different tux. I'll text you the details. What? Nice talking to you, too. Hey, man, you got the shit? - Hey, chill out, bro, all right? - Hey... - My family doesn't know my business. - All right. Neither does mine. It's all good. Come on. Come on. (sighs) - Chill out. - Hey, hey, now, listen, I didn't stop for any cash, 'cause I kind of... I have to smoke this. - Hey, Rush? - Yeah. I'm good for it, okay? It's not that. It's my pop. There... there's something wrong with his legs. I don't know, but I-I thought... - I was hoping... - What? He needs a doctor? - Yeah. - Great! - Is he in here? - Wait, dude. - Wait! - What? My father never goes to the doctor. He hates doctors. Kindred spirits. Seriously, bro... I need your help, but you got to be subtle. (laughs) Moi? Come on, let's do this. All right. So I try a second time. Bang. Nothing. Heart's still stopped. I'm thinking, "Great... I've just killed Tommy Lasorda." (laughter) Right? So I try a third time. Put the paddles on, charge 'em up. Bam. (laughter) This time, his eyes pop open, he looks at me, I look at him... and then he punches me right in the face. - (laughter) - Bang! Oh, shit. (laughter) Manny always gets us the best seats every season. Just behind first base. - Nice! - We love our Dodgers, eh, mijo? Hey, me, too; me, too. Hey, Emiliano, any chance we could crack open some of the good stuff over there, huh? (speaks Spanish) All right. (whispers) I got this. (sighs) Emiliano, sir, I couldn't help noticing you're walking with a slight limp there. You having a little trouble with your legs? Any tingling in your fingers? Frequent urination? No, no, we don't talk about that in this house, huh? All right. - You have those symptoms? - (sighs) The tingling and the... you know? Sometimes, huh? A veces. Why? I think it's likely you have diabetes. You know what that is, right? No, it's fine. Lots of people have it. It's very manageable, but... but, uh, unless we get you on the proper medication, then, uh, you could end up losing your toes or a foot, or even have your whole leg amputated. And then, you won't be able to sit in those nice seats that Manny gets you at the Dodgers, 'cause they don't have any wheelchair access down there. You know what I'm saying? Look, I know you don't like going to the doctor's, okay? I mean, who does? Come on. I'm gonna put you in touch with my friend Alex. He's a good man. He'll take care of you. I think the Dodgers are going all the way this year. I can feel it. I will see this doctor. I have your word? (sighs) My word. All right. (phone ringing) Hey. Change of plans. It better not involve tuxes. Yeah, it involves tuxes. No! No! I just left Tom Ford. I have a black tux, and I had it tailored. Great. We'll get the, uh, gray Brioni tailored, too. No. Rush, I justs listening to the clerk at Tom Ford talk about his puggle Desmond. I don't see the problem. They both sound perfectly adorable. Just make it happen, all right? (grunts loudly) Brioni. Brioni. Ah... MANNY: We've been trying to get him to see a doctor for years. You're the man, bro. Happy to help. What's up with you? What you talking about? You came all the way over here. You talked to Pop for nothing. - (phone ringing) - And you're smoking Purple Urkel when you're normally all Platinum Jack. - What's the deal? - (clears throat, mutters) (sighs) I'm relaxing, I'm taking your advice. Back off already. Geez, this guy. I'm calling for a favor. Oh. What do you want? Eloxifin. You have any access? Hold on. (clears throat) It, uh's Alex. - Black guy? - Yeah, he's looking for this cancer drug, Eloxifin. You got any connections for that in Mexico? You think everyone I know's a Mexican? Well... Can you get it or not? I'll ask around. Look, I just don't like being profiled. All right. Yeah, Manny's on it. (siren chirps) Oh, shit. Dude, put that shit out. I got to run. Walk. Dr. Will Rush? - All day. - I'm gonna need you - to come with me, sir. - Well, he has a prescription for that. Yeah, I got a prescription for this. Just get in the car... sir. (Rush sighs) May I, uh, ask you a question, Officer? Yes, sir. Am I being arrested? I'm not authorized to answer that, sir. Oh... all right. But somebody, obviously, ordered you to find me, and, what, bring me in? I'm not authorized to answer that, either, sir. Okay... (clears throat) Well, I am gonna call my lawyer. You'll probably recognize him, actually, when you see him. He's worked on a lot of very high-profile cases. And he finds situations like this... you know, when people's civil liberties are at stake... very interesting. He's gone up against the LAPD on numerous occasions, actually. Uh, Rampart, Rodney King. Any of those cases ring a bell? He's cost a lot of guys their pensions. It's Harry Grant. Hmm? Sorry. Sergeant Harry Grant. He-he told me where to find you. He said he needed help with a delicate situation. That's all I know... sir. Right. Thank you. It's good to know. (siren whoops) There he is. I knew you'd come. Yeah? It's not like I had a choice. How'd you find me anyway? I can find anyone with a cell phone in less than 90 seconds. So, uh, what trouble you got yourself into this time, Harry? A couple of my guys got a little crazy. Yeah? Over what? What do you think? A woman. MAN: It wasn't the first time, either. MAN 2: I knew there was something going on with you two. - You know shit , man! - You think that was the first time, huh? - I'm gonna send you back to the Stone Age! - Yeah, come on! - I don't care what you are. - RUSH: Ooh. What happened? This guy's sleeping with the other guy's wife, - and they're partners. - (sighs) Of course they are. All right. - Hey, do you work here? - Yeah. Can I have a bourbon, neat? Yes, sir. Coming through. All right, all right, I need you both to calm down, relax. Relax. Some space, please, Harry. All right, back up, everyone. Hey, put away those phones! Hey, hey, hey, look at me. - How you feeling? - I've been better. Yeah? I can imagine. Okay, try to breathe for me. (raspy breathing) Well, the left lung is fine, and his right lung is - still moving some air. - Can you take it out? Well, it appears he hasn't gone through anything major, but this is the sort of thing you want to do at a hospital... trust me. (groaning softly) The department doesn't need this kind of human interest story. That's why I called you. (sighs) Shit. It's okay, Sarge. (groans) I'll do it. Do what? (groans) No! No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. If we're gonna do this, let's do it properly, okay? Thank you. Carefully, at least. Uh, can you get me some plastic wrap, please? You're gonna be fine. He's got you. (sighs) Okay... Hold him up, Harry. MAN 2: Work with a guy for seven years. He's family. Then he goes behind your back and starts screwing your wife? Somebody get this guy out of here, please. Thank you.. Look at me... I'm going to pull this out very carefully and very slowly, but it's going to hurt like hell, okay? Ready for this? All right. Okay. Ready? Okay. - Slowly, very carefully. - Aah! Stop! Stop! Stop! (gasping rapidly) Please... Hey, kid, it's gotta come out. I'm sorry. It's gotta come out, all right? All right, let's do this. (sighs) (whimpering) - (groaning loudly) - (Grant speaking encouragement) (groans, gasps) - (grunts) - It's all right. It's all right. - Lift his shirt. Give me the wrap. - All right. All right... Come on. All right. Okay, all right... It's gonna help you, okay? (groaning) It's okay... Okay, we need to get this guy to a hospital, somebody! Come on. - Hold on, hold on... - Yeah, all right. Tell them he fell off a ladder onto a rake or something. - I don't know. - Come on, help him out. MAN 2: How could you do that to me, man... huh? Everything we've been through, you just run around and shit on me like that? Huh? You are dead to me! (indistinct shouting) You okay, man? Rush? You okay? Rush? (gasping) (panting) What were you thinking, Will? That you could just sleep with me, and no one would ever know? It has to come out. It has to. (Rush groans softly) (Rush panting) Come on. Hey, buddy. Come back to us. Come on, buddy. Hey. - Rush. - (inhales) - Ah, there you are. - (moans) Oh... what happened? You had a panic attack. Huh? Hey... That sounded very unlikely. Hey, give me that water. I'll bring you a cold rag, too. Thank you. He's fine. Thank you. All right, everybody, go back to your business. Rush... that was a certified panic attack. I've seen 'em a million times. Huh? You having some kind of issues? What are you, some kind of therapist? Geez. - (phone ringing) - C-Can you just give me some room, please? Thank you. (sighs) Shit. Hello. Dr. Rush, it's, uh, Stephen. Mrs... - Atchison's butler. - Yeah. I'm sorry to call you again, but... Mrs. Atchison is in such pain. If you could just give her something? Uh... tell her... Just tell her I'm on my way. Excuse me. Hi. Hello. Welcome to Yurt. I'm Eve, Dr. Rush's assistant. We spoke on the phone. I wanted to talk to you about his deal. She's the one who said no. I know you came to an agreement with Dr. Rush about his monthly stipend, but, uh, I'm not happy. - What do you want? - Stock options. Considering that Dr. Rush is the most exclusive private practice doctor on the West Coast and you have him at your beck and call 24 hours a day... which is a service that he provides to no other clients... I think... 20,000 shares vesting after 12 months is fair, with an additional 1,200 vesting monthly after that. We're not a publicly traded company. But you're planning an IPO by the second quarter of next year. What would make you think that? You just hired two senior managers with no tech experience whatsoever. And you have to do it by then, if you're planning to beat Applied Domotics, your competition, to the punch. He's already getting paid more in cash than the Facebook guy makes. He's better than the Facebook guy. Well, I've heard the Facebook doctor is actually really cool. Is the Facebook doctor taking Jordana Rourke out tonight? - Jordana Rourke? - Jordana Rourke. The Deathblade girl. The Deathblade girl. He's taking her to the premiere of Deathblade Five: The Butchering tonight. If we give you these options... can we meet her? One step at a time, fellas. One step at a time. Okay, you've got a deal. - (moaning) - Sorry. Mmm. (moaning) Come on. Got it. Ooh. Ooh! This is a long one. (clears throat) Ooh. Eh. Got it. Little thing nearly got away. Mmm. Thank you for coming back. You're welcome. I'm-I'm sorry that I, uh, couldn't treat you before. I had to do some research. I never knew how troubling these things could be. You know, some doctors told me that they didn't even exist. Really? Well, that is crazy. (both laugh quietly) All right. Oh. One right here. - (moaning) - Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. And... - there we go. - Oh. Worm-free. It's terrible to have those little monsters inside you. You don't want them to come out because they hurt so much, but... they have to come out. If they stay inside, they kill you. You don't know what I mean, do you? What? Uh, yeah. I-I do, actually. I slept with my father's wife. Ooh. That's a lot of worms. I know. Come on. Hey, Corrine. It's Will. Uh... we need to talk. The other night, that was... that was a mistake. Of almost Oedipal proportions. - I know... - No, no, no, no. Let me finish. And, um... I need you to promise me that no matter how angry you get with my father... and we both know how easy it is to get angry with him... that you will never, ever tell anyone what happened. Look, I-I would love to hurt him, too, but... (sighs) not Lily. I don't want to be part of wrecking her life, too... Will... I'm never going to say anything to your father. Really? Really. - You promise? - (chuckles) Yes, I promise. (chuckles) Whew. Good. That's good. That's-that's good. I have been going crazy since the other night, too, you know. Why do you think I've been calling you? Right, well, that is actually a relief to hear. Warren Rush is your past, but he's my present and my future. I don't want to lose my daughter. Well, you know, if we both keep quiet, there's no reason why... things just can't go back to the way they were. Absolutely. Right. Right, so we're-we're good? Mm-hmm. (sighs) Thank you. We know... it happened, though. What? I mean, we were both there. We did it. We'll always know it happened. Good point. But, um, we're never gonna talk about it again. No, of course not. Not to each other and certainly not to anybody else, right? Right. Right. But we can still think about it. (sighs) Um... I-I have to go, actually. There's somewhere I've got to be, but... Okay. Right. Hey. Just take my call next time. Right. Yeah. I'll b... I'll be sure to do that. (chuckles) Is this what I think it is? Yeah. I hope it helps. Thank you. Dr. Dangerous. (sighs) (inhaling) (sniffs, exhales) (phone blips) (quiet chuckle) - Come on. Can you tie any faster? - Don't even start with me. I just spent my entire day off shopping for two tuxedos - that you're not even wearing. - What can I say? They weren't me. All right. Jordana's not gonna be happy. - Jordana needs to settle down. - There. Ah. Oh. - Daniel Craig, eat your heart out. - Oh! Thank you. Right, where's my, uh... Ah. Okay. You seem like your old self again. Well, it's like they teach you at driving school, sometimes the best way to avoid an accident is to accelerate. Thank you. Had enough of nature's beauty, huh? Yeah. It got old pretty quick. Oh, Harry. Hey, how are you? Listen, uh, I need a little blue magic. (chuckles) All right. You can finish that. Very kind of you. Oh, and, uh... (imitates James Bond) take the rest of the night off, Moneypenny. (sighs) (crowd cheering, screaming) No, no, no, no! I got this. I got this. Thank you. All right. Hi, guys. Hi. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, guys! So much! Thank you. We need to go. Come on. We need to go. Okay. Where have you been? Where you been? Sorry! Hey, guys! Got to hand it to you, Rush, I had my doubts about the midnight blue, but... you almost look better than me. Oh, impossible. JORDANA: (chuckles) Thank you. Thank you, guys. Well, maybe you could take it as a life lesson. Let someone else take charge every now and then. You might learn to like it. Who's your date? Apparently, he can speak for himself. Rush, Will Rush.
