  Previously on Rush...
You're Rush's girl, right?
  We work together. And you are?
  Just a friend.
  (speaking Spanish)
 Do I look like a drug dealer?
 I need you to do a call for me.
  ALEX: Where? Chatsworth.
  That's deep Valley, Rush. Nah!
  Five grand. Deep Valley, here I come.
  Did you get the flowers?
  EVE: I threw them away.
  J.P.: He never knew us in the beginning, either, Eve.
 Rush knows exactly what we had, and he knows
  exactly who you are.
 The moment
anything gets real,
 you get out.
 I can't have you be
that way with me.
 Griffin,
this is Will Rush.
  You two here together?
  Yeah.
  It's good to meet you.
  RUSH: All right, well, this might feel
  a little strange.
  Or a little fantastic,
  depending on how you feel about catheters.
  Okay.
  In she goes.
  (groans)
  So, uh... what is pai gow, anyway?
  I've probably spent a year of my life in Vegas
  when you add it all up, but I normally head
  straight for the blackjack tables.
  It is a Chinese form of poker,
 played with dominos.
  Dominos?
That's right.
  Fun.
 And what, players aren't allowed to leave the table to...?
 Mr. Zhang believes it's unlucky
  to leave the game once it begins.
  He's willing to pay the price.
  My kind of guy!
  (speaks Chinese)
  Mr. Zhang would like you
to join us at the pai gow table.
  At 8:30 in the morning?
 Uh, can you tell him thanks, but I don't normally bet on games
 involving toys.
  He doesn't want you to play.
  He says you're lucky today.
  Me?
  Hmm. (chuckles)
 Can you tell him Lady Luck and I
  aren't exactly on speaking terms?
  (speaks Chinese)
  He says you are mistaken.
  All right.
  Well, what exactly would I have to do?
  (speaks Chinese)
  Just be near him,
  to bring your luck into his field of opportunity.
  Oh, right.
  (speaks Chinese)
  He'll pay you $10,000.
  Well, now you're talking my language.
 (shouts happily)
  (laughs)
  Wow, he's turning me into a believer.
  I can see that.
 Everything in the world is moved by invisible forces, Dr. Rush.
  We just have to learn to see the signs.
  Right.
  Encountering a grasshopper: good sign.
  Being given an umbrella as a gift: bad sign.
  Well, at the very least, it's a bad gift. (chuckles)
  (speaks Chinese)
 Mr. Zhang wants to know how much to bet on the next hand.
  Uh, I don't know. How much has he won already?
  About $600,000.
  Really?
  Uh, I don't know.
  Five grand?
  (speaks Chinese)
 He says it shouldn't be anything under $100,000.
  Oh. Right.
  He says trust yourself.
  Okay. A quarter mil.
 No, no, no.
I-I wasn't being serious.
  (speaks Chinese)
  Once the money's on the table,
  Dr. Rush, it cannot be withdrawn.
  All right.
  It is a very good hand.
  Thank God.
  (cell phone ringing)
 Sorry. I'm sorry.
 Sarah?
 Um, I-I have to take this call.
  (speaks Chinese)
 Mr. Zhang asks you
  please do not leave the table right now.
  Can you tell Mr. Zhang... You
know what? I'll tell him myself.
 Mr. Zhang, this is
the only person in the world
 I can't send
straight to voice mail.
 I'm sorry, I have
to take this, okay?
 You can't leave! Sarah? Don't walk away!
  Hey, yeah. Just give me a second, okay?
  Is that... is that Chinese I'm hearing?
  Yeah, uh, just ordering a takeout. Uh, hold on.
  Oh, wow.
  Uh... hey.
  How you doing? What's up?
  Um, just wondering if I could come by the hotel
  and see you today. Why?
 What? You don't want to see me?
  Uh, n-no, no. Of course.
  I just... um...
  Is-is everything okay?
  Yeah. No, everything's fine.
  I just haven't seen you in a while.
  I thought we could hang out.
  Okay, uh...
  Sure.
  Uh, lunch?
  Yeah, that's perfect.
  I'll see you then.
  All right.
  (quiet buzzing)
 Oh, hello.
  (gasps)
  (shouting in Chinese)
  LU: Dr. Rush! Dr. Rush!
 Oh, sh--.
  EVE: Good morning. (Rush grunts)
  Hey, has my dry cleaning been delivered? Tomorrow.
  Well, can you pick it up this morning, please?
 I need my blue sweater.
  Sure.
  And, uh, can you order some hydrangeas?
 Pink, purple and white.
  And some mineral water, still and sparkling,
  from housekeeping, please.
  Are we entertaining?
 I am, yes.
 And I'm gonna need you
to be out of here
 from 12:00 on. Who's coming over?
  (exhales) Sarah.
  Sarah? Mm-hmm.
  "Love of your life" Sarah?
Yeah.
  Now it's all making sense.
 Yeah. Well, no,
it's not, actually,
 because she is dating
someone else.
  So what's the occasion?
 I have no idea.
 Which is why I'm meeting
my chief romantic advisor
 right now in the bar.
  Oh, I wish I had a romantic advisor.
 You do.
  Who?
  Me. What's the problem?
  You know, it's... it's fine. Just go.
  No, come on. Tell me.
  If you tell me, I'm certain I can solve it.
  Your romantic advisor is waiting. Go!
  You sure? Sure sure?
  Sure sure.
  All right. Well, don't say I didn't offer.
  Oh, and don't forget my dry cleaning.
  I don't know. Do you know why she called?
 Maybe it was
just like she said.
 Maybe she just wants
to hang out.
  This is Sarah we're talking about, okay?
  What? Nothing.
  No, no. Come on. What? You know something.
 Maybe she got engaged.
  To Griffin?
 He did jump in a pool from
four stories after meeting you
 in an effort
to seem interesting.
  (sighs)
Maybe you're
starting a trend.
  No. No, I don't think that's it.
  (phone ringing)
What do you think it is?
  Hold on one sec.
  Pink, purple and white.
  Purple and white. Yes, I know.
 They've already been delivered.
  Oh, thank you.
  So, uh, what's up?
  Boss Nova's people called.
  Uh, no. No, Boss Nova. Not today.
  Any other day, yes. But not today, okay?
  Boss Nova?
  Yeah, he's a huge rap star.
 Hello? I'm a brother.
I know who Boss Nova is.
  Great.
  Uh, can you tell him I'm busy.
 He's a client
of yours? Yeah.
 How come you never told me that?
  Patient confidentiality.
  Did he say what the problem was?
  No, but he never does.
  (sighs)
All right. Just, um, tell him...
 We're available!
  Hold on one sec. "We're available"?
 Yeah, we're avail... "We"?
 Just... I'll go with you,
all right?
  I'll-I'll help out, whatever you need me to do.
  Hello?
I just want to meet the dude.
  Sarah's coming over.
 Yeah, for lunch.
This is breakfast.
  Wow. That five grand from Molly
  really put the hook in you, right?
 (sighs)
It's not about the money.
  Oh, right. So what is it then?
  What? You want to be me?
  You want to walk a mile
  in my very comfortable loafers?
Really?
  'Cause let me tell you, my friend,
  that is a dangerous mile.
 No, it's none of that sh--.
 I just want to meet Boss No...
 ♪ It's the Boss Nova. ♪
 (grunts)
 I'm a fan, come on.
  (sighs)
  Can you tell him I'll be right over?
  Got it.
  Thank you.
  Hanging up now.
 My brother.
  Oh, my God!
 Yo, Boss.
  (women laughing)
  Damn, Rush.
  I thought white people were supposed to be punctual.
  Yeah, well, I am the exception that proves the rule.
  Who's this?
 This, uh, this is my associate.
This is Dr. Alex Burke.
 He's shadowing me
today, so... What's up?
  You know I don't like people knowing all my sh--.
 Oh, it's...
 Oh, don't worry about me, Nove.
  I'm cool.
Yeah, he's cool.
  Oh, you... you cool?
  Yeah. I'm cool.
  Oh.
  Cool now?
Boss, come on...
  Stay out of this, Rush.
  The man say he cool; I want to see how cool he is.
  You scared?
 Boss, take it easy.
  How about now?
  My son has one just like that.
  Ha!
  I guess your man is cool.
  Y'all have a seat, man.
That's funny.
  Get me fixed up, man.
  This sh-- really hurts.
All right, right away.
 Okay. Mm.
 How'd you do that?
  Got into some sh-- with Pimp 6 last night.
  Right.
  Seems a bit fresh for last night.
  Well, that's what I said, didn't I?
Uh, Alex,
 why don't you do
the secondary.
  Okay. Okay, uh...
Yeah.
  So... how'd you get cut?
  What does it matter what I got hit with?
  To determine course of treatment.
  You could need a tetanus shot.
 It's fine, it's cool.
  Well, like I said... You know me, Rush. Yeah.
  I'm in the club, having a good time, me and the crew.
  We popping bottles, and you know how I do.
  Yeah. We having fun.
  All of a sudden, I see this fool across the way
  mean mugging me and talking sh--.
 So I politely walked over, like,
  "Yo, you got a prob..."
Oh, hey, can you hold still?
  Oh, my bad.
Thank you.
  I can help him solve his problem.
  And of course, he like, "Nah, it's all good, man.
  I don't have no problem with you."
  So I turn to walk away, and then boom!
  All of a sudden, one of his boys hit me in the head
  with a bottle, man-- caught me off guard.
  Mm. So it was a bottle?
  All good. It's alcohol, so it's clean.
  Um, any allergies,
 taking any medications?
 RUSH: It's all right. No legal ones.
  Recent surgeries?
  Why the hell is your man
  asking me all these damn questions, Rush?
  So I can give you these.
  Okay. Got them Oxies.
  That's what's up.
 All right.
  Okay. Sorry. Right.
 That should just
about do it. Mm.
 Yo, I'm having a listening party for my new joint tonight, man.
  About 10:00 at The Stax.
  You should come through.
Right. That's very kind, but...
  We'll be there.
  She said what?
 (whispering)
  Why you ain't handle that sh--?
 That's on you.
  Yo, got some sh-- to handle, man.
  Yo, this you.
Oh.
  You know your way out.
 Yeah, sure.
  What are you talking about, "we'll be there"?
 Yeah. Dude, you have no idea
how good you've got it.
 You know, some day,
you're gonna be me.
 And when you do, you're gonna
have a wife and kids;
 at home every single night
of the week.
 And going to a party
with Boss Nova's gonna seem
 like Christmas, Thanksgiving
and Easter all wrapped into one.
 You're breaking my heart. Well, don't break mine.
  Because I want my little chocolate Christmas turkey
  with all the fixings.
 Look, all I'm saying is,
 Laurel barely approves
of you hanging out with me.
 She's not gonna
approve this.
  It's gonna be that wild?
 If history's
any indication, yeah.
  Dude, then we definitely have to go.
 We got to go!
Definitely!
 It's Boss Nova! All right, fine.
 We'll go.
  Yes!
  (knocking)
  Well, hello.
  Hi. Nice hair.
  Nice sweater.
  (laughs) What, this old thing?
  Oh.
  Hi. Hi.
  SARAH: Whoa. Hydrangeas.
  Yeah. Well, uh...
  My favorite flower.
  Are they?
Thank you.
  So, uh, lunch is on its way, but can I get you
  a drink of something?
  I have mineral water-- still, sparkling.
  Mm... I'd love a Scotch.
  A Scotch? You?
  Yeah. Is that okay?
  Uh, yeah. Yeah. No. It's, uh...
  It's better than okay.
  It's fascinating.
  (clears throat)
  One Scotch.
 Thank you.
  Cheers.
Cheers.
  So, you want to tell me what's going on?
 What do you mean?
  Well, you're drinking in the middle of the day, you're here.
  What isn't wrong with this picture?
  I broke up with Griffin.
  Oh.
  Right. What happened?
  I don't know. I mean, maybe you were right.
  He's a little boring.
  (laughs) Well, I thought
  boring was exactly what you needed right now.
  Yeah, well...
  maybe life's too short.
  (phone ringing)
  Of course.
 Well, are you gonna
answer the phone?
  No. No, I've made that mistake before.
  Whoever it is can wait.
 I'm a big girl.
You can answer your phone.
  (ringing continues)
  All right.
  Hello. Yeah.
 Well, can you call an ambulance?
  All right, no, no. I, uh...
  Yeah, I'll be right there.
  You have to go?
  I'm sorry.
There's an emergency downstairs.
 Uh, okay, well,
should I just wait here?
  Actually, you know what?
  Come with me. It's a kid.
  Okay.
  Excuse me, please. Excuse me. Coming through.
 Has anyone called
an ambulance?
  You the parents? Yeah. Yeah.
  Yeah? All right. Excuse me.
  Hello, sweetie.
 You're gonna be okay. All right, what happened?
 Uh, I don't know.
 We were sitting here
waiting for the car,
 River was practicing
her little song
 for the beauty pageant. She's gonna be okay, right?
  Well, I think I need a little more information
  before I can ascertain that, sir.
  Then what happened?
  Well, um, she stopped singing, uh, she said she was dizzy.
 And then she started
breathing like this.
  Does she have asthma?
No.
  No? Any allergies? No.
  Where are you guys from?
Houston.
  Hmm. Could be the lantana.
  (girl panting)
  Was she swimming earlier?
  Uh, yeah. Um...
  Did she stay under
for an extended period of time?
  Yeah, she was showing us how
long she could hold her breath.
  She has water in her lungs.
  She can't extract oxygen from the air in her lungs.
  It's a dry drowning. Get me an Ambubag.
 Yeah, they should have one
in first aid.
 Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
 Oh, my God. Let's get her flat.
  Let's get her flat. Sweetie. Sweetie.
 Oh, River Ann.
River Ann.
  It's okay. It's okay. We're getting some oxygen.
  Back off, please. Back off. Sir, excuse me, please.
  Come on. All right. She's apneic.
 Please. Uh...
  Boron.
 Please, please, please.
 Please, please,
please. Here we go.
 Oh, please, please, please.
 River. Oh, you're back.
You're back. All right.
  There she is.
SARAH:
Let's bring her up.
  Up nice and slow.
You're fine, baby.
You're gonna be fine.
  Here we go. I'm just gonna pop
  this little mask on you, okay, sweetie?
  Here we go.
Oh. She gonna be okay?
  I think she's gonna fine.
  Take her to the hospital; they'll keep on some oxygen.
 She just has to recover.
  Okay.
Oh.
  So, can she still do the talent show tonight?
  (girl panting)
  I'm only thinking of her.
 We're thinking
about her, too.
  Your daughter has pulmonary edema.
  She just passed out and stopped breathing.
  She needs to be in a hospital,
 not at a beauty
pageant, sir.
 Hey there, Rush's girl.
  Okay.
  You're gonna have to stop calling me that.
  Yeah, I would if you told me your name.
  It's Eve.
  Eve. That's pretty. Like the Bible.
  No, nothing like the Bible.
 Crazy then,
like the rapper, right?
 Maybe a little like the rapper.
 I'm Manny. We met
at my cousin's garage.
  Yeah, I know. I remember.
  You... making a delivery?
  Uh... we like to call it visiting a friend.
 Wow.
 You're in an even worse mood
 than you were
the first time we met.
  What's the problem today?
 No problem.
 Just trying
to get some work done.
  You don't know this,
  but a big part of my job is listening.
  You know, people like to tell you all kinds of crazy sh--
  when they buy drugs; it makes them feel like
  it isn't just a purchase.
 Thank you, but... no thank you.
  You sure?
 I've got prime listening skills.
 You don't want
to hear this.
  Yeah, I do.
  I'm free.
(sighs)
It's okay.
  Go for it. I'm all ears, all right?
  Okay.
  I'm stuck.
  In what?
  In... myself. In...
  (sighs)
 I just... I can't move forward.
  You know what I like to do when I'm stuck?
 Let me guess.
 It involves a lighter
and a leafy green substance.
  No, but it does involve ear muffs.
  Oh, my God.
  I wanted to punch that little
girl's father right in the face.
  Yeah, I almost did.
 Yeah, but...
 you didn't.
 And you got flowers,
  and you got water.
  What's your point?
  I don't know.
  You seem different.
  Do I?
  Mm-hmm.
  Well, I, uh...
  I took a little trip recently,
  and let's just say, it changed
my perspective on a few things.
  Really? Mm.
  Where'd you go?
  (laughs)
  Well, that's not important, but... I...
  What I'm saying is, I'm agreeing with you.
  I am different.
  And if I might be permitted
  to mention the elephant in the room?
  What is going on with you?
  Me?
  Yeah, you seem different, too.
What are you talking about?
  Save a life, smoke a joint.
  It's just an average day for me, Will.
  Well, then I had a very different impression
  of your days.
  Well, you've missed a lot.
  I have.
  You know what?
  One thing I will say,
  seeing you down there with that little girl?
  You are gonna be one hell of a mom.
  We'll see.
  Well, why'd you say it like that?
 Will? Yeah.
 Can I ask you
to do me a favor?
  Of course.
  Can you just stop talking?
  Okay.

 You ready to give it a try now?
  I don't know.
  Look, trust me, all right?
  The kick on this thing will shake loose all the cobwebs.

  Yeah. Just keep your finger straight and off the trigger.
  Grip with your right hand nice and tight.

 No, no, wait,

 Yeah, but most dudes

  a bunch of paper around them

 Man, I really thought
that I was aiming at it.
  I bet you did.
  But here's the thing:

  line up your rear sight to your front sight

  Damn, shorty! (chuckles)
  Yeah.

  Oh, hang on a sec. Yeah.
  Who's that, Rush?
 No, it's a client.
 It doesn't say
it's an emergency.
 I'll get to it
in a sec.
 Just...
one more time?
  Yeah.
  There you go.
  And this guy, he's just staring at me
  while I'm putting this catheter in and looked really intense
  and is not even flinching and I'm thinking,
 "Am I... am I doing this right?" (chuckles)
  And then his-his translator looks at me
  and she says, "He thinks you're lucky."
  Really? Uh-huh.
  And then... you called.
  Well...
 ...maybe you are.
  Mmm, maybe I am.
  I got to go.
  What?
 Yeah. (chuckles)
  What, you're just gonna use my body as a plaything

  that's-that's my thing.
Oh, wow.

  Toughen up, Doc.
  Sarah... You just got lucky.
  Sarah.
  (phone ringing)
  Hey.
  EVE: Hey.
  I've got a call for you.
  Perfect. My afternoon just opened up.
  Is that good or bad?
 Mm. It's like everything today.
  It's... interesting. What's the call?
 That's the thing. I'm not sure.
  I got this text from a Mr. Vincent.
  I tried calling back a couple times. He didn't answer.
  Okay. And, uh, where is it?
  It's in West L.A.
  All right. Well, that's on the way to Alex.
  We've got the party at Boss Nova's tonight.
  What's the address?
  That's not our protocol.
  Oh, I know it's not our protocol,
  but I'm lucky today.
  Apparently.
  Rush.
 Let me guess.
"Mr. Vincent."
  You never would have agreed to meet me otherwise.
  Right.
  Rush, you were always so stubborn.
  Rush, you have to stop poisoning Eve against me.
 Poisoning Eve against you?
 I'm sorry.
I don't actually know
 what the hell
you're talking about.
  She won't talk to me, she won't see me.
  Yeah, no sh--, asshole.
  What about forgiveness?
  Forgiveness?
  Did you ever consider that it might be good for Eve
  to forgive me?
  Good for her.
  Look, I'm sober now.
Oh, I know. She told me. Congratulations.
  Don't mock what you don't have the courage to do yourself.
 Oh, right.
 You think it's some kind of
Get Out of Jail Free card?
 It doesn't undo
 the things that you did to her.
  She doesn't want anything to do with you,
  so leave her alone.
 You get it?
  Tell me you get it.
 I want to hear you
say those words.
 'Cause if you don't,
I swear to God,
 the next call I'm gonna make
is to the cops.
 Do you get it? I get it.
  I-I... I had to give it one last try.

  MAN: Yo, boss.
  Is this my ass?
 The hell you doing
with my phone, woman?
  Told you to stay out of my business.
  Just tell me, Jeffrey, is this my ass?
 Babe, I asked you
not to use
 my government name
around my friends.
  No, that's not your ass. So?
  No, I don't think it is either.
 Baby, don't-don't come in here
trippin'. It's me and the guys.
  You're the one who's trippin'.
Ouch!
  Hey, hey, hey! Take it...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
  This ain't your concern.
  All right.
  You got three little girls!
  You go messing with trash like that?!
  Bitch, you do what I say!
  (groaning)
  You seen this sh-- before?
 No, man. I told you.
It's a dangerous mile.
  Is she gone yet?
 Yeah, she's gone. Yeah, she's gone.
  Man, get your ass off of me!
 Why'd you stand there?!
You didn't even do nothing!
 Standing there
like a pedestrian.
  Get your ass out of here!
  I better not hear sh-- about this either!
  From nobody! I hear about some punk from TMZ
 come asking me strange questions about my wife, I'm gonna
  come find your ass.
Chill. I ain't
gonna say sh--.
 I got you.
It's cool. It's cool, all right? L-Let me take a look
  at your shoulder, okay?
Come on. Take a seat over here.
  Come on.
  Come on.
  Come on. Just sit down.
  All right.
  (groans) Oh, sh--.
  This is gonna take some work.
You need some help?
  No, no, no, I'm good. I'm good. Yeah.
You sure?
 You know what,
I'll let you guys handle it.
  Yeah. I'll come find you, all right?
  He runs his mouth, it's on you.
  I understand.
  This is gonna sting. (groans)
  Thank you.
  (exhales)
 Vodka and soda, please.
  You're a doctor, right?
  Yeah. Where'd you hear that?
 Mm, somebody said you're, like, Boss Nova's personal doctor.
  Uh...
  Yeah, I'm-I'm on his medical team.
  (chuckles)
 Would you mind taking a look
at something for me?
 Is that terrible?
 Are people always
asking you to... (laughs)
  Uh, it's fine.
  What's your problem?
 I'm Steffi, by the way.
  Alex.
  Come on.
  Where we going?
 To the bathroom.
It's personal.
 Okay.
  So, where does it hurt?
  Right here.
  Wait a minute. Um, I'm married.
  I know.
  (sighs): Oh.
  (pants unzip)
  Whoa.
  (exhales)
 So how'd you
find this place?
  It's the only place in L.A. that serves line-caught fish.
  I don't want to feel bad
  about ruining the world while I eat.
  Sorry about this.
  No problem.
  Sh--. (scoffs)
 What happened?
  Oh, man, nothing bad, it's just...
  it's getting to the point where my phone needs a phone.
  Either that or I need an assistant.
  And that's not gonna happen, becau...
 Because everything
that you do is illegal.
  Thank you, Captain Obvious.
  Appreciate it. Okay.
  Here's what you're gonna do. Ready?
  Mm-hmm. First, download Sketcher.
  It's a scheduling app. It looks at
 your e-mails and picks out
the times and dates and then
 it reminds you when you have
something that you have to do.
  Second, tell me...
  how did you become a drug dealer?
  Started delivering for some people.
  Kept track of the names and numbers.
  Made some calls.
  Took some initiative.
  You never wanted
to do something a little more...
  Legal?
  Mm-hmm. Of course.
  It just wasn't as lucrative.
So...
  what's your exit strategy?
  Winning the lottery.
You know that's...
  not actually an exit strategy, right?
  It's the one I got.
  Doesn't have to be.
  What about you?
  What about me? Well, I saw the way
  you looked at that target the second time around,
  with all... laser focus and sh--.
  Yeah?
  You had somebody in mind.
  Maybe.
  He the one that...
  has you so stuck?
 Yeah. I guess he is.
 Look, I had
a bad relationship.
  Really... bad.
  He messed with you.
  Yeah.
  Well...
  he did more than mess with me.
  I was pregnant.
 And, um...
  he wasn't... thrilled.
  So...
  ...he made it so I wasn't anymore.
  Let me tell you,
  you have every right to be stuck.
 But you won't be forever, okay?

 Hey, you seen the guy
I came in with?
 You all right?
  No. Not really.
 I drank way too much.
 Did something just...
 All right, come on,
let's get you out of here.
  Good idea.
(Boss Nova shouting)
 Don't you step to me
'cause your skinny-ass bitch
 whupped your ass!
  Who's that?
  It's Pimp 6.
  Oh, you got some nuts now, huh?
  A'ight.
  Oh, sh--!
  (gunfire continues)
  (crowd clamoring)
 BOSS NOVA:
Rush!
  Rush! Where's your punk-ass
  associate at?!
  Let's go.
  (grunts) Ow!
 You ready to die, bitch? Hey, Boss...
 Shut up, Rush! Yeah, you got a
real big mouth, but it's about
  to get even bigger when I blow the top of your head off. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Boss,
  Boss, Boss. All right, just-just put the gun down,
  all right? This guy is my best friend.
 He's a good guy,
he would not sh-- you.
 Well, who snitched, huh?!
  He's the only person that's new to the crew!
  I told you, I didn't do sh--.
 Oh, I remember--
you cool.
  All right, back off, okay?
  Get up, get up.
  Now, we are gonna walk out of here,
  and nobody's gonna stop us, you understand?
  You understand? Nobody.
  Nobody.
  Go.
  Rush, come on!
  How's it look?
 Like you got hit
with a gun.
  I don't know how to go in there.
  I really don't.
 I can tell you what I do.
 Tell myself it's a complicated
world and nobody's perfect.
 And then have a drink.
 Or a pill.
 Or... a line.
 Or all of the above.
 And move on.
  I'm not you, Rush.
  One day you might be me, but I'll never be you.
 Just... don't go in there
 and spill the beans
to Laurel, okay?
  You think I'm a dumb-ass?
  I'm not gonna do something stupid like that.
 Well, you came clean
about stealing the blood.
 I'm just saying, you got
this honesty thing going on.
 Just don't pretend
that you don't, okay?
  Look, I'm gonna go in that house,
  I'm gonna shut the hell up.
  If anybody asks me sh--, I'll lie.
  I ain't saying sh--.
 All right.
  I love you, man.
  What?
  Sarah's been talking to Laurel
  about fertility treatments.
  They asked me not to tell you, but...
  You know how we do it.
  Talk tomorrow?
  Oh, yeah.
  (engine stops)
  Thank you.
  For a nice day of sustainable seafood and firearms.
  My pleasure.
  Maybe we'll do it again sometime.
  Maybe.
  Hey, I'm...
  I'm glad you found me.
Me, too.
  And I'm gonna have that sh-- scheduled from now on.
  Damn right you are.
  Yeah.
  Be safe.
  You, too.
  Um...
  I don't... I don't know about
  a gun.
  I mean, just in case you need to get unstuck.
  Thank you.
  Of course.
  Later, Eve.
  Later, Manny.
