 [ BEAR GROWLS ] CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Troy: YOU READY TO GET UP? Kyle: NO. BUT I WILL. Narrator: IT'S LATE FALL ON KODIAK, AND AS HARSH WINDS AND BITTER COLD WHIP OVER THE ISLAND, THE KODIAK BEARS HAVE BECOME MORE AGGRESSIVE IN THE HUNT FOR FOOD, TURNING FROM BERRIES AND SALMON TO HUNTING FOR RED MEAT. NOW THEY ARE THE MOST VIOLENT AND UNPREDICTABLE. AND HERE, 40 MILES OFF THE COAST OF ALASKA, BOB MAY'S LODGE IS GEARING UP FOR A BUSY WEEK. Troy: WE GOT CLIENTS COMING TODAY. THIS WEEK, WE GOT TWO HUNTERS COMING IN. THAT MEANS DOUBLE THE WORK FOR ME AND KYLE. OUR SEASON'S ABOUT MIDWAY DONE. WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH THE MARATHON. WE'RE JUST ITCHING TO GET OUT IN THE WOODS TO GO ON A HUNT. KYLE, YOU NEED ANY WATER IN THERE? NOT AT THE MOMENT. WE'VE BEEN JUST BUSTING OUR ASSES, AND HOPEFULLY, THE GUYS HAVE SEEN IT. MAYBE WE'LL GET OUT FOR ONE DAY. Kyle: THE APPRENTICE GUIDES ARE LEFT WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WAKING UP BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE AND GETTING EVERYTHING SET. GOT TO DO THE BREAKFAST, MAKING SURE THAT THE FIRE IS LIT, THAT THERE'S HOT COFFEE, EVERYBODY'S GONNA BE COMFORTABLE AND HAPPY WHEN THEY WAKE UP. Bob C.: MORNING, BOYS. MORNING, BOB. MR. CUSACK. HOW'S SHE GOING? SHE'S GOING GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? FEELING PRETTY GOOD TODAY, REALLY. Bob C.: MORNING, ERNESTO. GOOD MORNING. MORNING, BOB. MORNING. HOW YOU GUYS DOING? MORNING, ROBERT. GOT ANY COFFEE? Kyle: WHY, YES, WE DO. LESS THAN A MINUTE AWAY. WELL, WE GOT A COUPLE HUNTERS COMING IN - ONE DEER HUNTER, ONE BEAR HUNTER. THINK ERNIE AND I ARE GONNA TAKE THE BEAR HUNTER OUT. BUT NORMALLY, I ONLY HAVE ONE GUY IN CAMP AT A TIME, BUT WE GOT ANOTHER HUNTER COMING IN, SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO PUT HIM WITH A GUIDE AND START HUNTING. [ CLEARS THROAT ] OKAY, GUYS, THE TWO HUNTERS MEANS TWICE AS MUCH WORK. JUST LET US KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO GET DONE, AND WE'LL DO IT. Ernie: I'VE TRIED TO DISCOURAGE TROY AND KYLE FROM GOING INTO GUIDING, BUT I CAN SEE RIGHT NOW, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. DO I WANT THEM TO BE OUT HERE HUNTING BEARS? NO. BUT IF THEY'RE GONNA DO IT, I WANT THEM TO DO IT TOGETHER. OKAY. HEY, ERNIE, LET'S GO MEET THAT GUY, HUH? OKAY. THANKS. YOU'RE WELCOME. OH. NO TIP? [ SCOFFS ] Bob M.: PAT. MY BEAR HUNTER. HOW YOU DOING? GOOD, BOB. ERNIE HOLLAND. I'M HIS SIDEKICK. ERNIE, GOOD TO MEET YOU. Bob M.: WE GOT A NEW HUNTER. HIS NAME IS PATRICK. HE'S AN EXPERIENCED HUNTER, BUT HE'S NEVER HUNTED BROWN BEAR BEFORE, SO LET'S HOPE HE DOESN'T LOSE HIS NERVE. WHAT'S THE NEWS FROM IN TOWN? A GUY GOT MAULED. WOW. HE SAW SOME ELK, AND HE CAME OVER THIS KNOLL. BEAR CAME OUT OF NOWHERE AND JUST BIT HIM THROUGH THE HAND, BIT HIM A FEW TIMES IN THE LEGS. HE OBVIOUSLY HAD TO KILL THE BEAR. NO, HE COULDN'T EVEN GET A SHOT OFF. BUT HE ENDED OKAY. HEY, THANKS, DEAN. OKAY. WE'LL SEE YOU LATER. THANKS, DEAN. YOU BET. Bob M.: HEARING THAT SOMEBODY GOT MAULED OUT HERE, IT'S A SOBERING REMINDER THAT THIS IS A DANGEROUS GAME. YOU CAN LOSE AND LOSE BIG HERE ON KODIAK. HEY, WE JUST WANT YOU TO CHECK YOUR GUN, MAKE SURE IT'S ON AFTER YOU TRAVELED AND WHATNOT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO ANYWAYS, SO... GO AHEAD AND GET COMFORTABLE THERE, AND LET'S POP A COUPLE OF CAPS HERE AND SEE WHERE YOU'RE SHOOTING. BEARS, THEIR TEMPERAMENT IS DICTATED BY THEIR DIET. WHEN THEY SWITCH FROM THAT FISH TO MEAT DIET, THEY GET AGGRESSIVE. AND YOU BETTER HAVE A GUN THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON. [ GUNSHOT ] Bob M.: BULL'S-EYE! BULL'S-EYE? I MEAN, YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE CAN. THAT WAS GOOD. OKAY. CALL IT GOOD. Bob M.: I KNOW HE'D SHOT IT AT THE RANGE AND SIGHTED IT IN, BUT IT'S HARD TO TEST A RIFLE UNTIL YOU'RE IN THE FIELD. LET'S GO HUNTING. YEAH, A BEAUTIFUL DAY, HUH? FEEL LIKE IT COULD RAIN OR DO SOMETHING, THOUGH. Narrator: AS DAWN BREAKS ACROSS THE BAY, BOB AND THE HUNTING PARTY PREPARE TO HEAD OUT. HIS PLAN IS TO TAKE PATRICK UP TO HATCHERY CREEK, WHERE HE THINKS AN OLDER MALE BEAR IS ON THE PROWL. Oh, yeah, right here. That's a pretty good bear. You can kind of see some tracks. He's probably about a 10-foot bear, at least. Hopefully, that big bear comes back through here. Narrator: BACK AT CAMP, KYLE AND TROY READY THEMSELVES BEFORE THE SECOND HUNTER ARRIVES, BUT WITH THE BEARS BECOMING MORE AGGRESSIVE, BOB CUSACK WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE APPRENTICES ARE PREPARED FOR THE WORST. BOYS, GOOD TO SEE YOU. YEAH, TROY AND KYLE ARE COMING ALONG PRETTY WELL, YOU KNOW? NOW IT'S TIME TO SEE HOW THEY CAN HANDLE THEIR WEAPONS. WHEN YOU'RE IN THE FIELD HUNTING LIKE THESE BOYS WILL BE, THAT GUN'S GONNA BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. Kyle: WHAT DO YOU GOT HERE? Troy: OH-HO, LOOK AT THIS. OH, WE GOT A LITTLE DRILL SET UP FOR YOU. I SEE THAT. THIS IS GONNA SIMULATE THAT CHARGING BEAR. Narrator: THE BARREL MIMICS A KODIAK BEAR CHARGING AT 25 MILES AN HOUR. THE HUNTER HAS ONLY 4 SECONDS TO GET OFF AS MANY SHOTS AS HE CAN. AND I'D PRACTICE MY ASS OFF IF I WERE YOU, 'CAUSE IT MAY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KILLING THE BEAR OR THE BEAR KILLING YOU OR YOUR CLIENT. WITH SHOOTING UPHILL AND IT COMING DOWN, DO YOU WANT TO AIM LOW SO YOU CAN GET ON YOUR SPOT? YOU GOT THIS BIG-ASS KODIAK BEAR COMING RIGHT AT YOU. YOU CAN'T PLAY GAMES. DON'T WORRY ABOUT UP AND DOWN. ALL CONCENTRATION'S GOT TO BE ON THE CENTER OF THAT BEAR. AIM RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS THING'S SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE. ALL RIGHT. IT LOOKS AWESOME. I'D RATHER LEARN THIS WAY THAN HAVING A BEAR CHARGING AT ME, SO I JUST HOPE I HIT THE DAMN THING. YOU GUYS READY? YEAH. WITH BEAR HUNTING, THINGS HAPPEN REAL FAST. IT'S GOT TO BE SECOND-NATURE - PULL UP, SHOOT, AND MAKE A GOOD SHOT. THERE'S NO RUNNING. YOU GOT TO STAND THERE. YOU KILL HIM, OR HE KILLS YOU. LET HER GO. I THINK YOU DID PRETTY GOOD THERE. HOW'D IT FEEL? THE SECOND ONE, I WAS PULLING BACK, TRYING TO CALM DOWN, AND, MAN, THAT THING COMES QUICK. IT'S ON YOU BEFORE YOU KNOW IT. SHOULD I CYCLE IT FROM HERE OR DROP IT DOWN? WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK, WITH ADRENALINE, GOING TO CYCLE IT RIGHT FROM THERE. CYCLE IT FROM RIGHT HERE? AND THAT'S THE BEST, YEAH. AND, BANG, IT'S READY TO GO. OKAY. IF THIS TRAINING BUYS ME AN EXTRA SECOND WHEN I'M STARING AT A BEAR CHARGING ME, THEN IT'S WELL WORTH IT. ALL YOU ALL READY? I'M ALL SET. SAFETY'S OFF. LET HER RIP! YOU GOT TWO QUICK ONES OFF. WHERE'D THEY GO? Kyle: THIS IS TROY'S GROUPING RIGHT HERE. IS THAT RIGHT? GOOD. YOU GOT AN INCH BETWEEN YOUR SHOTS. TROY KICKED MY ASS IN SHOOTING. IT'S A GREAT FEELING FOR ME BECAUSE I KNOW IF WE'RE OUT IN THE WOODS AND HE'S BACKING ME UP, I KNOW THAT HE'S GONNA PUT THE BULLETS RIGHT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE, AND HE COULD SAVE MY LIFE, DEFINITELY. THAT'S REALLY GOOD. THANKS. KYLE'S WASN'T AS GOOD, SO INSIDE, I'M LIKE, "YEAH!" BUT AROUND EVERYONE ELSE, I KEEP IT DOWN. I DON'T WANT TO BE THE DICK LITTLE BROTHER THAT'S OUTSHOOTING HIS OLDER BROTHER. Bob C.: THE IDEA HERE IS PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE. TROY DID REALLY WELL ON THE BARREL. THAT TELLS ME THAT HE'S GOT THE GUTS AND NERVE TO STAND THERE, KNOWS WHAT HE HAS TO DO. I'M REAL HAPPY WITH THAT. WELL, YOU WANT TO RUN A FEW MORE? OH, HECK, YEAH. Narrator: 6 MILES NORTH, BOB, ERNIE, AND PATRICK ARE TRACKING A 10-FOOT, 1,500-POUND KODIAK BROWN BEAR. Patrick... Here, there's a big smashed-down area. See there in the grass? Right there. That would've been a logical track for him to take it down this way. [ FLIES BUZZING ] Bob M.: WHEN A BEAR STARTS EATING OTHER BEARS, THAT BEAR IS TWICE AS AGGRESSIVE. IT'S A WHOLE NOTHER BALLGAME. [ BUZZING CONTINUES ] EDDIE: He's here. He's here for sure. And he knows we're here. Oh, yeah, he knows we're here. I mean, we're standing right in his lair right now. [ FLIES BUZZING ] Narrator: 6 MILES FROM THE LODGE, BOB, ERNIE, AND PATRICK FIND THEMSELVES IN THE LAIR OF A CANNIBALISTIC BEAR. A PREDATOR THIS AGGRESSIVE COULD SEE THE HUNTING PARTY AS PREY, AND IT MIGHT BE CLOSE BY. Bad things happened here. Bob M.: WHEN A BEAR STARTS EATING OTHER BEARS, THAT BEAR IS TWICE AS AGGRESSIVE. IT'S A WHOLE NOTHER BALLGAME. Well, this is, uh... pretty dicey. We got to get the hell out of here. YOU KNOW, THESE BEARS EAT RED MEAT, AND WE'RE RED MEAT. Narrator: BACK AT CAMP, A NEW HUNTER ARRIVES. HOWDY. ARE YOU JASON? YEAH. PLEASURE MEETING YOU. I'M BOB CUSACK. HEY, BOB. NICE TO MEET YOU. HE'S AN ALASKAN, AND HE'S HERE TO HUNT DEER AND FEED HIS FAMILY. Narrator: THE ISLAND'S SITKA BLACK-TAILED DEER ARE A PRIZED FOOD SOURCE. WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS TRY TO GET YOUR STUFF UP TO THE LODGE BEFORE IT GETS TOO DARK, OKAY? SOUNDS GOOD. I ACTUALLY LOVE BRINGING BLACK-TAILS BACK HOME. MAN, THAT'S GOOD EATING. THEY'RE SOME OF THE BEST. MARIS, DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE SOME TEA? YES, PLEASE. COOL. SO, I'M GONNA - THIS IS OLD WATER. I'M GONNA GET SOME - OH. OH, NO. WINTER'S MOVING IN. IT'S PRETTY COLD, AND SO THE PIPES HAVE FROZEN UP. Marisa: THIS ISN'T WATER FOR LUXURY. WE NEED THIS WATER AROUND CAMP IN ORDER TO KEEP THINGS GOING. AS BOB MAY SAYS, WE ALWAYS HAVE RUNNING WATER. WE JUST ALWAYS HAVE TO RUN AND GET IT. MY DAD WASN'T EXPECTING TO HAVE TWO GIRLS, BUT HE TELLS US EVERY DAY HOW PROUD HE IS OF ALL THAT WE'VE DONE AND THAT WE'RE ABLE TO BE OUT HERE AND BE JUST AS CAPABLE AS A COUPLE OF BOYS. HOO. YEAH, THE STREAM IS PRETTY FROZEN ALREADY. LET'S DO THIS. YEAH. Nicole: WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO DIP OUR BUCKETS INTO THE STREAM BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY SHALLOW AND THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIRT AND STUFF ON THE BOTTOM, SO WE SET THE GRAVITY LINE TO JUST HAVE A NICE STREAM INTO OUR BUCKETS. THE JOINT - THE ELBOW IS NOT STAYING WHERE WE SAID IT SHOULD. TRY TO MAKE SURE I DON'T SLIP AND BREAK MY ASS. MARISA AND I, WE WERE RAISED IN REMOTE ALASKA, BUT CURRENTLY, I'M AN ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO. I'VE BEEN TO BUSINESS SCHOOL, I WENT TO LAW SCHOOL, AND I WORKED REALLY HARD TO GET TO WHERE I AM AT MY LAW FIRM. I LIKE THE WORK, BUT I'M IN A POINT IN MY LIFE WHERE I'M KIND OF DOING A CHECK. WHOO! GOOD JOB, MARIS. DOES IT FEEL LIKE IT'S GONNA STAY? YEAH. IT'S WEDGED BETWEEN THOSE ROCKS. WE'RE GOOD. OKAY, PERFECT. AFTER I SHOT MY DEER, THEN I REALIZED IT'S GOOD FOR ME TO BE CONNECTED TO THE NATURE AROUND US AND THE EARTH. [ GUNSHOT ] I DIDN'T FEEL REGRET. I FELT PROUD. AND IT'S CHANGED ME. IT'S CHANGED MY PRIORITIES, AND IT'S CHANGING HOW I WANT TO LIFE MY LIFE. THIS IS A GOOD FLOW FOR NOW. OOH. I KNOW YOU'RE PRETTY TOUGH, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO FILL THEM UP TOO MUCH. LIVING IN ALASKA MAKES YOU CONSIDER FOOD AND WHAT YOU CONSUME DIFFERENTLY. Marisa: I'M HAPPY THAT NICOLE CAME BACK AND WAS ABLE TO GET THE DEER THAT SHE WANTED TO GET. IT MADE HER REALIZE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS SHE WANTS TO DO AND CONSIDER AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT MAKE HER HAPPY. READY? YEP. OKAY. LET'S GO. I FEEL GROUNDED IN ALASKA. I FEEL CENTERED IN ALASKA. I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND A LOT MORE TIME UP HERE IN ALASKA. GOOD JOB! THAT WAS FAST. EASY. YOU'RE GUIDING TODAY, BUD. YEAH, I KNOW. OKAY? YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. Ernie: BOB AND I ARE SPLITTING UP CLIENTS TODAY. HE'S TAKING PATRICK, AND I'M TAKING JASON. THIS IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO TAKE MY BOYS OUT ONE AT A TIME. I WANT TO TEACH THEM THE RIGHT WAY TO HANDLE A CLIENT BECAUSE I'M GONNA MAKE DAMN SURE, IF THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO, THEY'RE GONNA BE PREPARED. TROY, THIS IS YOUR GUN? COOL. Troy: I REALLY DIDN'T EXPECT TO GET PICKED TO GO ON A HUNT WITH MY DAD AND JASON. KYLE'S THE FIRSTBORN SON. HE KIND OF HAS THE RIGHT TO DO IT. MY DAD PICKED ME. KIND OF A CURVEBALL. BUT I'M PUMPED AND I'M EXCITED TO GO. Kyle: HAVE A GREAT DAY. WE'LL SEE YOU IN A BIT. COME BACK BEFORE DARK. OTHERWISE, I'LL HAVE TO COME FIND YOU. LATER, KYLE. Kyle: YEAH, I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT IT, AND I'D LIKE TO BE OUT THERE, FOR SURE, BUT I'LL KEEP MY HEAD IN THE GRIND HERE, DOING THE WORK AROUND CAMP. THAT'S ALL THAT I CAN REALLY DO. Ernie: JASON'S HERE FOR DEER, AND WE'RE GONNA GO FIND THE DEER WHERE THEY ARE, AND THAT'S A LONG WAYS FROM HERE - 8, 10 MILES. Narrator: TRAVELING NORTH FROM THE LODGE, ERNIE AND TROY GUIDE JASON TO HUMPY CREEK. IT'S AN AREA OF LUSH FOREST WHERE SITKA BLACK-TAILED DEER FIND PLENTIFUL FOOD AND SHELTER. BUT WHERE THERE'S DEER, THERE WILL ALSO BE FEEDING BEARS. ERNIE: Keep your eyes open for any deer scat, any kind of tracks. Ernie: TROY'S JOB IS TO TELL ME HOW MANY SALMON HE SEES GOING UP THE STREAM, BECAUSE IF THERE'S SALMON IN THE STREAM, THAT MEANS THAT THERE WILL BE BEAR ON THE STREAM. AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HUNTING DEER, WE NEED TO BE SAFE. Narrator: 5 MILES WEST, AT HATCHERY CREEK... BOB M.: That's a well-used deer trail right there, isn't it? Mountain's right there. BOB MAY HAS HIS SON ROBERT ALONG TO HELP TRACK A 10-FOOT BEAR THAT HAS ALREADY PROVEN TO BE VERY AGGRESSIVE. Bob M.: WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BEARS WITH PAT. I LOST A LITTLE SLEEP LAST NIGHT OVER IT. YESTERDAY WAS HARD ENOUGH, AND TODAY, WE'RE LOOKING AT GOING AT IT EVEN HARDER. Try and walk where I do. Just be quiet. I'M GLAD I GOT BOB WITH ME. IT'S NICE TO HAVE THOSE YOUNG EARS AND EYES, TOO, LOOKING. AND WE GOT TO PUT OUR GAME FACE ON TO GET PATRICK A BEAR. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] YEARS AGO, WHEN I WAS A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN, I HAD A HATCH COVER FALL ON ME, KIND OF BUSTED ME UP A LITTLE BIT, SO STARTING TO FEEL THOSE PAINS A LITTLE BIT MORE WHEN I WALK. **** OOH. POP A GASKET. [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] IT'S A STEEP SON OF A BITCH. FEEL LIKE THE OLD BUFFALO THAT'S GONNA GET EATEN BY **** WOLVES HERE ANY MINUTE. MY ANKLE HURTS ALL THE WAY TO MY KNEE NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. FEELS LIKE MY WHOLE LOWER LEG'S CRAMPING UP. DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED. MY ANKLE'S BUGGING ME, AND, UH... HEY, I DIDN'T GET THIS WAY LOOKING FOR THE REMOTE CONTROL. HOLY **** **** HURTS, MAN. I'm sorry. Oh, man. Boy, it's burning right up from my ankle, up the outside of my leg, about up in here for some reason. Robert: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER IN MY LIFE I'VE HAD TO SIT DOWN WITH MY DAD WHILE HUNTING. NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THEIR DAD NOT BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY LOVE DOING. THAT'S SCARY, YOU KNOW? LET'S CALL IT. ERNIE: Psst! Psst! Take a few steps. Stop and look. Troy, stop. Take a look around every once in a while. Narrator: TODAY, ON TROY'S FIRST HUNT OF THE SEASON, ERNIE GIVES HIM PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN TRACKING AND GUIDING. Cut right down through here. Just take it easy till you can see the deer. MY DAD'S BEEN DOING THIS HIS WHOLE LIFE AND RAISED US IN THIS, AND IT'S LIKE GETTING THE BEST PROFESSOR, AND HE'S ONE-ON-ONE WITH YOU, AND HE'S TELLING YOU ALL OF HIS TRICKS. YOU KNOW, HE'S TEACHING YOU ALL THE **** THAT MOST GUYS HAVE TO LEARN THE HARD WAY. YOU KNOW, I'M BLESSED TO HAVE HIM AS A DAD. Shh! Quiet! Let me listen. Let's go over into the trees, get out of the wind, eat some lunch, and we'll talk about it. Sounds good. All right. I like that - that little ear trick that you did there. That is based on the bull moose, which amplifies its hearing with its horns. I got a few other ones. You just have to wait and see. [ CHUCKLES ] Ernie: TROY WANTS TO BE A GUIDE. THAT'S OBVIOUS TO ME. AND I'M NOT TOTALLY OKAY WITH IT YET. I'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER IF KYLE JUMPS IN, AS WELL, AND HELPS HIS BROTHER OUT, HAS HIS BACK, JUST LIKE BOB MAY HAS HAD MY BACK OVER THE YEARS. Well, it's fun having you out here. I know that you're champing at the bit. I just want to make sure you're ready. That's all. Yeah. It's fun being out here with you, man. [ BIRD CALLING ] Kyle: TODAY, IT'S JUST ME IN CAMP. WHEN I'M STUCK HERE IN CAMP AND I SEE EVERYBODY ELSE JUST HEADING OUT ON HUNTS AND I'M LEFT ALONE JUST TO DO ALL THE CHORES AND WORK MYSELF, I QUESTION WHETHER IT'S WORTH IT OR NOT. WHEN I'M NOT UP IN ALASKA, GUIDING, I SPEND MOST OF MY TIME COACHING AND PLAYING SOCCER. I GREW UP PLAYING SOCCER, AND A DREAM OF MINE WAS ALWAYS TO PLAY PROFESSIONALLY, AND I GOT CLOSE TO THAT LEVEL. WHEN I'M OUT COACHING SOCCER, I'M THINKING ABOUT BEING UP HERE, BUT NOW THAT I ACTUALLY GET UP HERE AND I'M DOING THIS, YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING ABOUT BEING BACK ON THE SOCCER FIELD. DO I WANT TO BECOME A GUIDE? SOMETIMES I THINK YES, AND OTHER TIMES, NO. Narrator: AFTER AN OLD INJURY FORCES HIM TO ABANDON THE TRAIL OF A 10-FOOT BEAR, BOB MAY RETURNS TO CAMP EMPTY-HANDED. Bob M.: I'M GONNA GO REST MY ANKLE. Ernie: YOUR DAD LOOKS PRETTY BAD. HIS FOOT'S **** UP BAD. IT REALLY IS. IT'S THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HAD TO WAIT FOR HIM. HE SHOULDN'T BE IN THE FIELD ANYMORE. HE'S STUBBORN. I WANT TO GET OUT OF MY **** GEAR. ALL RIGHT. I'LL GET OUT OF YOUR WAY. SEE YOU, ERNIE. Robert: HE'S BEEN TRYING REAL HARD. YOU SEE THE FRUSTRATION IN HIS FACE, AND YOU SEE THE FRUSTRATION PHYSICALLY. AND HE AIN'T GOT NO QUIT IN HIM, SO HE'S GONNA KEEP DOING WHAT HE'S DOING, AND IT'S GONNA SLOWLY PUT HIM OUT OF THE WALKING. [ OWL HOOTS ] Kyle: WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR TODAY, DAD? AM I STICKING AROUND CAMP AND CHOPPING WOOD AGAIN TODAY? YOU WANT TO GO HUNTING? I WOULD LIKE TO GO HUNTING, YEAH, IF, UH, TROY DOESN'T MIND. ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S GOING ON THIS MORNING? HEY, TROY, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A DAY OFF? I'M GONNA TAKE KYLE WITH ME TODAY. IS THAT OKAY? YEAH. HE NEEDS TO GET OUT IN THE WOODS, AND, UH, YOU CAN WORK AROUND CAMP TODAY, HUH? YEAH. NO PROBLEM. AWESOME. ALL RIGHT. GET YOUR STUFF TOGETHER QUICK. WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. ALL RIGHT. LET ME PUT THIS BACK. I'VE BEEN GRINDING ON CHORES ALL WEEK, AND THIS IS THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO HUNTING, SO WHATEVER I CAN DO TO MAKE IT EASIER ON THOSE GUYS AND HELP THEM IN ANY WAY THAT I CAN, I WILL. Narrator: TODAY, ERNIE AND KYLE ARE TRYING A DIFFERENT ROUTE A MILE NORTH OF YESTERDAY'S UNSUCCESSFUL HUNT AT HUMPY CREEK. ERNIE: There's almost no sound. Even the creek barely covers our sound, so we're just gonna have to creep up this thing. Yeah. YOU'RE OUT IN THE WOODS AND YOU'RE GUIDING A CLIENT, WHETHER YOU'RE AN APPRENTICE OR A FULL-BLOWN GUIDE, YOU NOTICE JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING. YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG, THEN YOU CAN PUT YOURSELVES IN HARM'S WAY AND PUT YOUR CLIENT IN HARM'S WAY, SO YOUR SENSES ARE HEIGHTENED. YOU NOTICE EVERYTHING. Trusty electrical tape. [ DEER CALL SOUNDS ] WHEN YOU'RE USING A DEER CALL HERE ON KODIAK, YOU'RE MIMICKING A FEMALE DEER IN HEAT. THAT CAN LURE BIG MALES IN. BUT IT CAN ALSO BRING IN BIG BEARS, SO WE HAVE TO BE READY FOR THE WORST. Narrator: AT HUMPY CREEK, KYLE HAS HELPED ERNIE GUIDE JASON TO HIS FIRST CHANCE AT GETTING A BUCK. AND NOW THEY'VE CALLED THE DEER IN CLOSE. ERNIE: There he is. You can take him. Shoot him. Wait till he comes out. He's gonna give us a shot at him right over here. Wait till he comes out. He's looking at us. There he is. You can take him. [ LIPS SQUEAKING ] I don't know. I'd rather hold out. He's too small. That's all right. Ernie: PART OF BEING A GUIDE IS RESPECTING THE DECISION OF YOUR HUNTER. IF HE DECIDES NOT TO TAKE AN ANIMAL, YOU JUST HAVE TO RESOLVE YOURSELF TO THAT FACT AND LIVE WITH IT. YOU JUST GOT TO WORK THAT MUCH HARDER TO GET HIM ANOTHER ONE. Wasn't a big deer. It was a... STARTING TO GET DARK, SO WE SHOULD GET BACK TO THE BOAT. YEAH. WE AREN'T GONNA MAKE IT OUT BY DARK, BUT WE'LL GET - WE'LL GET AS LOW AS WE CAN, HUH? YOU LEAD THE WAY, HUH? LET'S GET US MOVING. Kyle: COMING OUT AND HUNTING, IT REMINDS ME OF WHERE WE GREW UP AND OUR ROOTS AND WHAT WE LOVE ABOUT BEING OUT HERE IN ALASKA. AND HOPE TO PASS IT ON FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THIS IS OUR LAST SHOT. WE'RE LOOKING FOR ANY MOVEMENT. Narrator: IT'S THE FINAL DAY OF JASON'S HUNT, AND THE PARTY HAS RETURNED TO HUMPY CREEK. WE'RE GONNA TRY AND CROSS THE CREEK AND THEN GLASS FOR BIG BUCKS. READY OR NOT, KYLE AND TROY ARE BEING PUT TO THE TEST. THEY'VE GOT TO HELP ERNIE GET JASON A DEER TODAY. LET'S GO. Ernie: I'M JUST HAPPY I GET THE CHANCE TO GET OUT HERE WITH MY KIDS. NOW WE NEED TO MAKE THIS HUNT GOOD, AND WE NEED TO GET JASON A DEER. THERE'S A FRESH PILE OF SCAT. Ernie: WHEN I FIND FRESH SCAT, IT MEANS DEER ARE NEARBY. Look. Good eye, Troy. He's coming this way. You see it? That's perfect. There he goes, there he goes. He's coming. Okay, Jason, go ahead and take him. There you go. You got him now. GOT HIM! LET'S GO! LET'S GO! Troy: EVERY SINGLE BEAR KNOWS THAT SHOT, KNOWS THAT THERE'S A DOWNED DEER, SO GOT TO BE ON IT FAST SO WE'RE NOT CHASING A BLOOD TRAIL IN BEAR COUNTRY. HE'S GONNA BE RIGHT ON THIS TRAIL HERE. OVER HERE. I THINK I SEE IT. WE PUT OUR HAND ON THE DEER JUST TO SAY THANKS, YOU KNOW, FOR GIVING ITS LIFE. MY DAD'S TAUGHT IT TO US. HIS DAD TAUGHT HIM. IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE WERE RAISED WITH - JUST TREAT THE ANIMALS WITH RESPECT. Ernie: THANKS, BIG FELLA. NOT A BAD LITTLE BUCK. THIS TURNS OUT TO BE A GREAT HUNT. HE GOT A NICE BUCK. HE'S GONNA BE ABLE TO FEED HIS FAMILY. WITH MY KIDS BY MY SIDE, THIS WAS A GAS. CONGRATULATIONS. AFTER SEEING THEM IN THE WOODS HUNTING WITH JASON, I FEEL MUCH BETTER ABOUT THEM GUIDING. OF COURSE, THEY HAVE YET TO FACE A BEAR, AND IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT, I WANT THEM TO GET A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE UNDER THEIR BELT BEFORE THAT HAPPENS. DO I PUSH IT ALL THE WAY OUT AND PULL IT BACK? A LITTLE BIT OF WATER GETS IN THERE ON THE FIRING PIN AND THINGS GET RUSTY, IT COULD LET YOU DOWN. AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A GUN THAT YOU WANT TO USE FOR THE BEAR, YOU'LL BE OUT THERE HUNTING THIS DEER, AND THE DAMN BEAR JUMPS UP, YOU WANT THIS THING TO FUNCTION, YOU KNOW? YEAH. DEFINITELY. NICOLE SHOT A DEER, AND I THINK SHE DID A NOBLE JOB. I'M PROUD. SHE WANTED TO EXPERIENCE IT, YOU KNOW? DID YOU HAVE FUN ON THAT HUNT WITH ROBERT? YEAH. IT WAS GOOD. WHEN I WAS OUT THERE, I REALIZED I FELT REALLY ALIVE. COMPARING MY LIFE EVERY DAY, GOING TO WORK, SITTING AT THE DESK, AND THEN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR ME UP HERE NOW, I JUST KNOW THAT I NEED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES. I NEED TO MAKE ALASKA A BIGGER PART OF MY LIFE. I WANT TO FEEL AS HAPPY ALL THE TIME AS I FEEL RIGHT NOW. NOW THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED WHAT I'VE EXPERIENCED AND REALLY THOUGHT ABOUT THINGS, I DON'T THINK I CAN GO BACK TO THE WAY THINGS WERE. I'M REALLY SET ON MAKING CHANGES. I'D LIKE TO HELP YOU NEXT HUNTING SEASON, IF YOU THINK I COULD BE HELPFUL TO YOU. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S GONNA BE. ASSISTING ME, LET'S SAY, YOU KNOW? YEAH. I'M GOOD WITH THAT. Narrator: IT'S THE LAST DAY OF PATRICK'S HUNT. DESPITE BOB'S HURT ANKLE, HE INSISTS ON PUSHING DEEPER INTO THE BUSH IN SEARCH OF A MASSIVE 10-FOOT, 1,500-POUND KODIAK HE KNOWS IS IN THE AREA. WE'RE GONNA CATCH A BEAR MOVING TODAY DOWN IN THERE, I'LL BET YOU. YOU KNOW, IT'S THE LAST DAY OF THE HUNT, AND IT'S ALMOST A LITTLE BIT DEGRADING ON MY PART THAT I CAN'T FIND PATRICK A BEAR. MY REPUTATION'S ON THE LINE, TOO, ON THIS DEAL. I'D SURE LIKE TO GET UP ON THE MOUNTAIN HERE. WE GOT TO GET UP HIGHER, SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE COUNTRY, AND HOPEFULLY SPOT A BEAR. There's his track right there. That scat's pretty fresh right there. You could warm your hands on it. So everybody be on your toes. I think that big sucker knows we're here right now. And he's just giving us the slip. He didn't get to be a 10-footer by being stupid. HE KNOWS HE'S BEING TRACKED, AND THE MOST DANGEROUS THING WITH A BROWN BEAR IS THEY WILL AMBUSH YOU. I MEAN, THEY WILL WAIT FOR YOU. AND THEIR INTENTION IS NOT TO COME OUT AND SLAP YOU AROUND. THEIR INTENTION IS TO COME OUT AND KILL YOU. Looks like we found where he slept last night. This is really new. It's not frozen, either. Where do you see it? All the way at the top. See that brown spot there? The brown spot in the middle. Right there in that little creek bed. Where? No, that's not a bear. That is a big Sitka black-tail. You want to take this deer or keep trying for a bear? IF PATRICK DECIDES TO TAKE THIS DEER, WE'LL HAVE TO CLEAN IT AND GET IT BACK TO CAMP RIGHT AWAY. IT'S OVER. [ IMITATES DEER CALL ] ROBERT: He's cornered right at you. Perfect shot. What are you gonna do? Troy: KODIAK ISLAND. YOU CAN'T JUST DRIVE TO IT. YOU GOT TO FLY IN OR BOAT IN ONLY. IT'S PRETTY REMOTE OUT HERE. YOU NEED WATER, YOU NEED WOOD, YOU NEED HEAT. YOU GOT TO GO DO IT YOURSELF. Bob M.: THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS I DON'T DO OUT HERE IF I WAS ALONE. BECAUSE YOU FALL IN THE WATER OUT HERE IN WINTERTIME, MR. HYPOTHERMIA'S GOT YOUR ASS, AND YOU'RE DEAD. Kyle: THINK ABOUT HOW FAR YOU GOT TO GO TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL, YOU KNOW? IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE JUST DRIVING DOWN THE STREET TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. YOU GOT TO HAVE A HELICOPTER COME AND PLUCK YOU OUT OF THE MOST REMOTE, DANGEROUS AREA YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN. Ernie: THERE'S BIG REWARDS, AND THERE'S BIG RISKS. DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE. [ BEAR ROARS ] Narrator: 10 MILES FROM CAMP, DEEP IN THE HEART OF BROWN BEAR COUNTRY, THE PARTY HAS JUST SPOTTED A LARGE SITKA BLACK-TAILED DEER THAT WILL FILL PATRICK'S FREEZER WELL INTO NEXT YEAR, BUT IT'S NOT THE BEAR THAT HE SET OUT FOR. BOB M.: You want to take this deer or keep trying for a bear? IF PATRICK DECIDES TO TAKE THIS DEER, WE'LL HAVE TO CLEAN IT TO GET IT BACK TO CAMP RIGHT AWAY. IT'S OVER. He's right there. Take him. Shoot. Right that way. [ GUNSHOT ] YOU GOT HIM. YOU HIT HIM. WE GOT TO GO AFTER HIM. WE BETTER FIND HIM BEFORE A BEAR DOES. YOU HIT HIM RIGHT HERE SOMEWHERE. HOLY... THERE HE IS. WHAT A BUCK. OH, MAN! **** AROUND DAY AFTER DAY. IT'S JUST THRILLING TO GET A DEER LIKE THIS. Bob M.: HE'S 200 POUNDS. WHEN WE WALKED UP TO IT, I THINK WE WERE ALL PRETTY SURPRISED AT HOW BIG IT REALLY WAS. Patrick: THAT IS INCREDIBLE, GUYS. Bob M.: IT'S A CONSOLATION PRIZE, BUT IT CERTAINLY ISN'T WHAT HE CAME FOR. I DON'T GET SOMEBODY A BEAR, I INVITE HIM TO COME BACK AND TRY AGAIN.
