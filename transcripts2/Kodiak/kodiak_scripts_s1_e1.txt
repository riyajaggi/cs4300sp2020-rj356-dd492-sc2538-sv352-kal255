 Chances of seeing a bear up here are pretty good. GROWING UP IN ALASKA, MY DAD ALWAYS TOLD US THAT THE KODIAK BROWN BEAR - IT'S EVERYTHING THAT ALASKA IS. THAT IS A BIG BEAR. THAT'S OVER A 9-FOOT BEAR, AND YOU CAN SEE HIS TRAIL. HE IS MOVING. THESE ARE THE LARGEST CARNIVORES ON THE PLANET, AND YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL, 'CAUSE JUST WHEN YOU'RE HUNTING THEM... I can hear that bear up there.

 ...THEY'RE HUNTING YOU. IN THESE WOODS, THE ONLY WAY WE SURVIVE IS TO DEPEND ON OUR BROTHERS, FATHERS, AND FRIENDS... HOPE EVERYBODY'S UP FOR THIS, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA HAPPEN QUICK. There's the bear right here. Come on, come on, come on. Right there, right there, right there, right there. He's coming in. I see him. OH **** I'M JAMMED. I'M JAMMED. GOT IT. ...PRETTY SOON, THOUGH, MY DAD'S GENERATION WON'T BE WALKING THESE TRAILS ANYMORE, AND IT'LL BE UP TO US YOUNG GUYS TO CARRY ON THIS WAY OF LIFE.

 CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS I WONDER WHAT KIND OF SHAPE THINGS ARE IN. 40 MILES OFF THE COAST OF ALASKA LIES 3,600 SQUARE MILES OF UNTAMED WILDERNESS - KODIAK ISLAND. WITH NO ROADS, THE ONLY WAY INTO LEGENDARY GUIDE BOB MAY'S LODGE ON AFOGNAK BAY IS TO BRAVE THE ROUGH CONDITIONS BY AIR OR BY SEA. YOU GO OVER TO YOUR CABIN YET? BOB, HIS SON ROB, BOB'S BEST FRIEND, ERNIE HOLLAND, AND HIS BOYS, APPRENTICE GUIDES KYLE AND TROY, COME HERE EVERY FALL TO STOCK UP FOOD FOR THEIR FREEZER AND GUIDE HUNTERS FOR THE LARGEST PREDATOR IN NORTH AMERICA - THE KODIAK BROWN BEAR. I'VE SET MY SIGHTS ON THIS CAREER FOR A WHILE NOW. THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO. YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO BE IN A CITY. I WANT TO BE OUT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS 'CAUSE, I MEAN, IT'S AMAZING OUT HERE. TROY IS MY YOUNGEST BROTHER. TROY AND I BOTH LOVE DOING EVERYTHING OUT IN THE WOODS TOGETHER, AND WHO BETTER SPEND IT WITH? I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING A FULL-BLOWN GUIDE AND BREAKING OUT OF THE APPRENTICESHIP. HEY, YOU GUYS, COME UP HERE FOR A MINUTE. ALL RIGHT. GET THIS STUFF OFF OF HERE. LET'S ROCK. GOT HUNTERS COMING IN TOMORROW. ALL RIGHT. YEE-HAW. MY NAME'S BOB MAY. I'M A GUIDE HERE ON KODIAK. BEEN GUIDING BROWN BEARS HERE FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS OR MORE. TO BE A BEAR GUIDE HERE ON KODIAK, IT NOT ONLY TAKES THAT PIECE OF PAPER, BUT YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. BELIEVE ME, IF YOU SCREW UP, HELL'S COMING TO BREAKFAST. MAN, WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. GO. GO, GO, GO. I'M EXCITED TO GO HUNTING WITH ERNIE. ERNIE IS MY BEST FRIEND. I KNOW ERNIE'S GOT MY BACK. HE'S GOT MY BACK IN A BAR FIGHT, AND HE'S GOT MY BACK GOING IN ON A BEAR. AND WE'VE DONE BOTH. I'VE KNOWN BOB MAY SINCE HE WAS **** YELLOW IN DIAPERS. OKAY, THIS WEEK ON "ALASKA," WE'RE GALE BARBECUING. GALE BARBECUING. YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT TO TRY THIS AT HOME. THEY BROKE THE FREAKING MOLD WHEN THEY BUILT HIM. I DON'T THINK GOD HAS ANOTHER MOLD LIKE THAT. IF YOU LOSE THE FLAME, WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT? I USUALLY GO WITH THE HIGH-OCTANE AVGAS FOR THE RE-LIGHT, FOR THE RESTART. THERE'S NOBODY I'D RATHER HAVE STANDING BEHIND ME IN A BAD SITUATION THAN HIM. SMOKEHOUSE IS KNOCKED OVER. GARBAGE EVERYWHERE. OBVIOUSLY, WE GOT A BEAR PROBLEM HERE. YEAH, LET'S A LOAD OF GUN OR TWO, HUH? WE'VE GOT A POPULATION OF PROBABLY 3,500 BEARS HERE ON THE ISLAND. EVERY YEAR, THEY GIVE US ABOUT 200 BEARS TO KILL. IF THE POPULATION GOES UNCHECKED, OLDER MALES WILL ATTACK AND KILL THE ISLAND'S YOUNG CUBS AS THEY COMPETE FOR FOOD. A LOT OF TIMES, IF THEY OVERPOPULATE, THEY START GETTING INTO TOWNS, AND THEY CAN KILL YOU. AND THEN, MOST LIKELY THEY'RE GONNA EAT YOU. I DON'T KNOW WHEN HE WAS HERE LAST, BUT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG. GET BUSY. JUST ONE MORE CHORE WE GOT TO DEAL WITH. MIGHT AS WELL GET STARTED. WHAT MAKES THESE BEARS SO DANGEROUS, ABOVE AND BEYOND ANYTHING ELSE, IS THAT THEY'RE SMART, AND THEY KNOW HOW TO USE THAT 1,400 POUNDS OF MUSCLE TO BASICALLY GET WHAT THEY WANT. GET THIS PLACE WARMED UP. GO AHEAD. WE GOT TO GET A FIRE GOING IN HERE FOR STARTERS. BRR. YEAH, NICE AND COLD IN HERE. AT LEAST IT'S NICE AND CLEAN. START GETTING READY. THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO. ROBERT, YOU CAN BE IN CHARGE OF KYLE AND TROY THERE IN GETTING THAT BEAR STUFF CLEANED UP OUT THERE, HUH? TROY, YOU AND KYLE GET THOSE .500s OUT, GET THEM LOADED, AND CARRY THEM. THE BOYS ARE PUSHING TO BECOME BEAR GUIDES, AND RIGHT NOW, I'M NOT WANTING MY KIDS TO DO WHAT I DO BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT KIND OF DANGER'S OUT THERE THEM. YOU GUYS BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU'RE UP THAT WATERLINE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THIS BEAR'S AT, BUT HE WAS OBVIOUSLY HERE NOT TOO LONG AGO. WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF TO DO, SO LET'S GET ON IT. TROY, YOU CAN HELP ME LIFT THE SMOKE SHED. KYLE, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD AT PICKING UP TRASH. ROBERT GREW UP HERE. I MEAN, HE WAS POTTY-TRAINED DOWN HERE IN THE CREEK WHEN I MADE HIM WASH HIS ASS OFF WHEN HE WAS 2. HE IS DEFINITELY THE TRUE OUTDOORSMAN IN THE FAMILY. THIS THING'S NOT GONNA BE LIGHT. THE ISLAND'S A PART OF MY BLOOD. WELL, I'M A COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN MOST OF THE YEAR, SO I'VE BEEN OUT OF THIS GAME FOR A LONG TIME. BEEN WORKING FOR MY DAD ALL MY LIFE, AND I WANTED TO GO TRY SOMETHING NEW. I'M GLAD HE'S BACK. I MEAN, I KNOW HE'S STILL GONNA GO FISHING - QUICK, FAST MONEY - BUT I'M GETTING A LITTLE OLDER, AND I JUST - I NEED A HAND. WELL, IF YOU GUYS WANT TO BE A GUIDE, THIS IS WHERE IT STARTS, YOU KNOW, GETTING THE CAMP READY. LET'S CHECK THE OIL ON THE GENERATORS AND THE GAS, AND THEN LET'S GET WOOD SITUATED SO WE HAVE SOME DRY WOOD PUT UP. I'M JUST HERE TO HELP PUT THIS TOGETHER FOR MY DAD, DIRECT KYLE AND TROY IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND THEN I'M OUT OF HERE. DON'T PUSSYFOOT AROUND. GET 'ER DONE. GOT IT. I'M READY FOR THOSE HUNTERS TO GET IN HERE, MAN. GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD. IT'S THE FIRST DAY OF HUNTING SEASON, AND APPRENTICE GUIDES TROY AND KYLE HEAD INTO MARMOT BAY TO CATCH FOOD FOR THE CAMP. STATE LAW IN ALASKA FOR GUIDING, YOU NEED THREE YEARS' APPRENTICING UNDER A HEAD GUIDE, SO THIS WILL BE MY THIRD YEAR AND HOPEFULLY MY LAST YEAR. THIS LOOKS LIKE A SPOT. I'LL GIVE IT A TRY HERE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. YEAH, THIS'LL DO. YOU GET THE BIRD'S NEST. BREAKING OUT OF BEING AN APPRENTICE GUIDE TO A FULL-BLOWN GUIDE - IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY JUST HAND OUT IN CRACKER JACK BOXES. IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN. DUDE, YOU GOT US IN A GOOD SPOT. THAT'S DEEP. HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF CATCHING SOMETHING HERE. YEAH. BASICALLY, EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID... YEAH, SEE YOU LATER, TROY. GOOD LUCK HUNTING. ...I'D REMEMBER MY DAD COMING HOME FROM THESE HUNTS AND TELLING THE COOLEST STORIES, AND HE HAD THE BIGGEST SMILE ON HIS FACE, AND HE WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE COOLEST THINGS, MET SOME OF THE COOLEST PEOPLE, AND SOMEDAY, I HOPE TO KIND OF FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS. THIS IS MY DREAM OUT HERE. I MEAN, DAD'S NEVER REALLY WANTED US TO DO THIS. YOU'VE HEARD HIM SAY THAT SINCE DAY ONE. TELL US WE'RE NOT GONNA DO SOMETHING, THEN WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? YEAH, WE'RE GONNA GO DO IT. AND IF THINGS START GETTING TOUGH, JUST LEAN ON EACH OTHER. JUST LIKE MY DAD AND BOB HAVE BEEN HAVING EACH OTHER'S BACKS, YOU KNOW, IN THE WOODS, I'M HOPING THAT KYLE'S GONNA BE, YOU KNOW, MY BACKUP AND I'M GONNA BE HIS. GOT TO IMPRESS THE OLD GUYS, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, WE'LL BE RUNNING THIS **** HOLY! OH, YEAH. BRING HIM HOME. YEAH, LOOK AT THAT. THAT'S A DOOZY. OH, YEAH. I THINK I HEAR A PLANE. THE SOUND OF A de HAVILLAND FLOATPLANE MEANS THE SEASON'S FIRST BEAR HUNTER HAS ARRIVED. IT'S ALWAYS EXCITING WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR FIRST HUNTER COMING IN, AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE'LL GET HIM A BEAR, AND HOPEFULLY A REAL NICE BEAR. A LEGEND IN THE BUSINESS, BOB MAY HAS GUIDED HEADS OF STATE AND INDUSTRY. THESE HUNTERS COME IN FROM EUROPE, THE U. S., THE SOUTH, THE EAST, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD OF BOB MAY. IS THIS MY MAN? MY NAME'S BEN HULL. I'M A GOLD MINER FROM FAIRBANKS, ALASKA. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE. FIGURED I'D BRING THE OLD MAN WITH. IT'S A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME TRIP. THIS IS GREAT. YOU KNOW, EVERY HUNTER THAT WE HAVE COME INTO CAMP, I ALWAYS HAVE 'EM SHOOT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO. MAKE SURE THE GUY KNOWS HOW TO USE HIS FIREARM. SO, ARE YOU READY FOR US TO CALL ONE IN FOR YOU? LET'S DO IT. LET'S POP A COUPLE OF CAPS, HERE, AND SEE WHERE YOU'RE SHOOTING. THE MINIMUM CALIBER FOR A BROWN BEAR - .338. YEAH, YOU BETTER BE CARRYING A BIG GUN. I'M WATCHING TO SEE HOW FAMILIAR THEY ARE WITH THEIR FIREARM, AND ACCURACY IS A BIG THING. I LIKE THEM DEAD-ON AT 100 YARDS. AH, A LITTLE BIT LOW AND TO THE LEFT. IF YOU'RE FIRST SHOT ISN'T GOOD ON A BROWN BEAR, YOU'RE GONNA BE IN TROUBLE BECAUSE THE BROWN BEAR FILLS WITH ADRENALINE AND BECOMES A SUPER BROWN BEAR AND A SUPER-DANGEROUS BROWN BEAR. AND LOOK A THAT. YOU'RE ABOUT ½½ INCH OF CENTER. I THINK MY FIRST RESPONSIBILITY IS FOR A CLEAN KILL TO THAT ANIMAL, YOU KNOW? YOU OWE IT TO THAT ANIMAL YOU'RE HUNTING, THAT - AND YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING ANIMALS SUFFER OR RUN OFF WOUNDED. AND SO HE'S GOT TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT. AS MORNING BREAKS, THE WEATHER ON KODIAK HAS TURNED, PLUMMETING TO 28 DEGREES AND BLANKETING THE AREA WITH SNOW. WEATHER TURNS TO CRAP. OH, YOU GOT TO LOVE THIS WEATHER. WE CAN'T TAKE THE BOAT OUT, SO WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT, SO WE'RE HIKING. NOW THE PARTY IS FORCED TO VENTURE THREE MILES SOUTH ON FOOT, RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART OF BEAR COUNTRY. SNOW, RAIN, SLEET - WE'RE JUST LIKE THE POSTAL SERVICE, YOU KNOW? WE'RE GONNA HUNT EVERY DAY. AND HOPEFULLY, WE'RE GONNA PICK UP A TRACK. WE'RE JUST GONNA GO UP THROUGH HERE AND THEN JUST WORK THAT WAY OVER TO THE LAGOON. IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT ANOTHER HALF A MILE OR SO TO THE LAGOON. AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF LAGOONS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE ISLAND. WE'RE GONNA GO CHECK THOSE OUT. THERE'S A FEW BEARS BACK IN THERE, CHASING BEAVERS. HOPEFULLY, WE'LL SEE SOME FRESH BEAR SIGN. YOU KNOW, TRACKING TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND A LOT OF EXPERIENCE. IT'S SLOWING DOWN, BEING VERY, VERY OBSERVANT, LOOKING FOR A LITTLE PIECE OF BRUSH THAT'S BROKEN, A LITTLE SPOT OF BLOOD ON A BLADE OF GRASS. IT'S A PUZZLE, AND YOU FIGURE IT OUT. TRACK RIGHT HERE. HE'S A PRETTY GOOD ONE. LET ME SEE. YEAH, THAT'S A BIG BEAR. YOU PUT YOU HAND ACROSS THE PAD, AND IT'S THAT PLUS TWO. THAT'S A HUGE, HUGE, BEAR. 10-FOOT. YES, 10-FOOT. BEN, WE'RE JUST ABOUT UP TO THIS LAGOON. IT'S ONLY A COUPLE 300 YARDS. THE BEAR'S GOT EVERY ADVANTAGE OVER US. THEIR SENSE OF SMELL IS SO MUCH GREATER THAN OURS. IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR THEM TO SMELL SOMETHING FROM 15 MILES AWAY. THAT WHOLE BIG MUZZLE, THAT'S JUST ONE BIG FILTER. The idea here is, Ben, that we want to - we want to see him before he sees us. I'm getting anxious. Shh, quiet. What is that? Holy **** Some reason, I'm feeling really good about this spot. GUIDE'S BOB AND ERNIE, ALONG WITH HUNTER BEN, HAVE JUST DISCOVERED THE TRACKS OF A KODIAK BEAR. JUDGING FROM THE SIZE OF THE PRINT, THE BEAR IS A FULL-GROWN MALE STANDING 10 FEET TALL AND LIKELY IN SEARCH OF FOOD. I'm getting anxious. Shh, quiet. What is that? Holy **** It's just a deer. Looks like a buck. The color's right. NORMALLY, IF THERE'S A LOT OF RELAXED DEER AROUND, THERE'S USUALLY NOT A BEAR AROUND. YEAH, IT'S NOT A GOOD THING. SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP MOVING HERE AND SEE WHAT WE SEE. BACK AT THE LODGE, TROY AND KYLE TAKE STOCK OF THE CAMP'S RAW MATERIALS. WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA NEED SOME MORE WOOD. AND LORD KNOWS WHAT BOB WILL DO TO US IF WE RUN OUT OF GOOD WOOD. OUT HERE, YOU NEED WOOD, YOU NEED HEAT, 'CAUSE IF WE GET SNOWED IN AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY, IT'S GONNA GET COLD REAL QUICK. WHOA. WE AIN'T GOT NEAR ENOUGH WOOD. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THE BOAT AND GO OUT AND FIND SOME BEACH WOOD. I'LL SHOW YOU GUYS HOW TO DO IT, BECAUSE WE CAN'T CUT DOWN ONE OF THESE TREES. THEY'RE AS WET AS ALL THIS WOOD. IF WE CUT DOWN A LIVE TREE, YOU GOT TO LOG IT UP AND SPLIT IT AND THE WAIT FOR IT TO DRY OUT. SO THE DRIFTWOOD'S A LOT DRIER. WE'RE GONNA JUMP IN THE BOAT, GO AROUND, AND CHECK OUT THE BEACHES AND TRY AND DRAG A LOG OFF THE BEACH. TAKING **** BIG WAVES. WE COULDN'T HAVE PICKED A BETTER DAY TO DO IT! WE'RE THE ASSISTANT GUIDES. THAT'S OUR JOB, TO TAKE CARE OF THE CAMP DUTIES. MAYBE THEY'RE NOT THE MOST GLAMOROUS JOBS, BUT IF THIS IS WHAT IT TAKES FOR ME TO BE A MASTER GUIDE, YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO, AND I'LL DO IT. OH **** MAN. THAT THING IS HUGE. OKAY, HERE'S THE PLAN. I'M GONNA CUT THE LOG IN HALF. I'LL GET YOU GUYS TIED UP TO IT, AND YOU GUYS YARD THE TREE OFF. WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BRING THAT BACK? I DON'T KNOW. THAT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY BIG CHUNK OF ROOT ON THERE. YEAH, I'D HAVE TO CUT THE BACK END OF IT OFF 'CAUSE IT'S WEDGED IN THERE SO GOOD. MAN, THIS IS LOOKING KIND OF DICEY. ARE WE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT IN ON THESE ROCKS? LAST THING WE NEED TO DO IS BE STRANDED OUT HERE. I'M TRYING TO HOLD THE BOAT OFF THE BEACH AS BEST AS I CAN. I'M TRYING TO KEEP IT FROM BANGING, 'CAUSE THE LAST THING YOU NEED IS A HOLE IN A BOAT. YOU MIGHT SWIM 50 FEET BEFORE YOUR BODY JUST GIVES OUT ON YOU. OH **** YOU READY? ALL RIGHTY. JUST SIT OUT THERE AND DRIFT FOR A MINUTE. THIS THREE WEEKS' WORTH OF WOOD RIGHT HERE ALONE. HOPEFULLY, HE'S GOT ENOUGH POWER, MAN. THAT'S A BIG LOG. FINALLY GOT IT. IT POPPED LOOSE. NOW WE JUST GOT TO CLEAR A PATH SO THAT WE CAN GET A GOOD SHOT AT GETTING IT OUT OF HERE. CUT ALL THESE BRANCHES OUT OF THE WAY, AND THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO TOW BOTH OF THEM OUT OF HERE. **** DANG IT. WELL, THAT'S A BIG **** PROBLEM! CHAIN GOT BINDED IN THIS TREE, SO WE MIGHT BE **** ARE YOU SERIOUS? WELL, THAT TREE ATE THAT CHAIN. THAT WAS MY LAST CHAIN FOR THAT SAW. AND WE'RE ABOUT 100 MILES FROM A **** STORE. ALL SORTS OF **** PROBLEMS. RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST GONNA GO BACK. SO, WE'RE HEADING BACK IN WITHOUT ANY LOGS. SIX MILES DOWN THE COAST... IT'S GETTING NASTY, MAN. IT'S COMING UP. YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA BE GETTING DARK HERE IN A LITTLE BIT. ...WITH THE SLEET INCREASING AND THE LIGHT FADING, BOB AND ERNIE ARE LEFT WITH FEW OPTIONS. WHEN IT STARTS GETTING DARK, YOU GOT TO GET THE HECK OUT OF THE WOODS, AND YOU GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE FAST, BECAUSE MR. BROWN CAN SEE IN THE DARK AND WE CAN'T. JUST GOT TO KEEP MOVING. ALL RIGHT. YOU KNOW? REPUTATION MEANS EVERYTHING IN THE GUIDING BUSINESS. IF BOB DOESN'T GET A BEAR FOR THE CLIENT, HE TAKES IT PERSONALLY. WE'VE GOT TO GET BACK. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE CHOPPING THE SAME WOOD AGAIN. WHERE'S THE NEW WOOD? WELL, WE DIDN'T - DIDN'T QUITE GET IT TODAY. YOU DIDN'T GET IT? NO. I MEAN, I'M SURE YOU GUYS GOT TO HAVE A GOOD STORY, HERE, BUT THIS IS **** STRAIGHT UP. THESE GUYS ARE JUST STANDING AROUND WITH THEIR THUMBS UP THEIR ASS, AND IT THINK IT'S BOTH THUMBS. A LOT MORE TO BEING A GUIDE THAN JUST GOING OUT AND CHASING AN ANIMAL AROUND. FIRST, YOU GOT TO LEARN THE BASICS. YOU GOT TO THINK OF THE COMFORT OF THE CAMP, CLIENTS, EVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT. DIDN'T BRING IN ANY SHORT LOGS IN THE SKIPS OR NOTHING? YOU GOT ANYTHING FOR ME? DO I HAVE TO GIVE UP A DAY OF BEAR GUIDING TO GO GET WOOD? ROB, YOU GOT ANYTHING TO ADD TO THIS? I MEAN, YOU WERE IN CHARGE TODAY. MY DAD'S GOT A RIGHT TO BE MAD 'CAUSE WE DIDN'T GET OUR JOBS DONE TODAY. WHAT ELSE DID YOU GUYS DO TODAY? YOU MAKE COOKIES? DID YOU DO ANYTHING? ANY **** THING? I DON'T WANT TO COME BACK TOMORROW AND FIND NO WOOD AGAIN. I DON'T GIVE A **** IF YOU GOT TO CHEW A TREE DOWN WITH YOUR **** TEETH TOMORROW. YOU NEED TO GET SOME **** WOOD IN HERE. **** **** I'M DEFINITELY NOT LETTING BOB DOWN AGAIN. I MAKE A MISTAKE OR TROY MAKES A MISTAKE AS AN APPRENTICE GUIDE, HE'S NOT GONNA TRUST YOU WITH SOMETHING LARGER, LIKE TAKING A CLIENT OUT. OVERNIGHT, THE WEATHER FLIPS AGAIN, BRINGING WARMER AIR THAT WILL MEAN MORE ACTIVE BEARS. BUT BEFORE HE HEADS OUT, BOB NEEDS TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING MORE PRESSING. HEY, BOB. GETTING ALL READY TO GO, HUH? JUST GOT A FEW MORE THINGS, THEN I'M PACKED. I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU TO GO, MAN. I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT I MEAN, WITHOUT THIS LODGE, I'M NOTHING. IT'S KIND OF MY LEGACY. I WANT FAMILY TO ALWAYS RUN THE PLACE, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO PASS THE TORCH SOONER OR LATER. I THINK I NEED YOUR HELP. I GOT A REPUTATION. I MAKE GOOD MONEY. I'M NOT GONNA GIVE IT UP. I MEAN, I WAS APPRECIATING YOU COMING IN JUST FOR DAY OR SO TO HELP ME, BUT IT AIN'T GONNA WORK. TROY AND KYLE, I MEAN, THIS IS THEIR, LIKE, APPRENTICESHIP, AND I NEED YOU KIND OF HERE TO SHOW THEM WHAT TO DO. I MEAN, THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THOSE GUYS DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO. SO, I DON'T KNOW. I'M NOT GONNA TURN MY BUSINESS OVER TO JUST ANYBODY. THE EXPERIENCE NEEDS TO BE THERE, AND ROBERT HAS ALL THE POTENTIAL IN THE WORLD TO BE ONE OF THE BEST GUIDES THERE IS. I MEAN, I KNOW THIS COD JOB'S PRETTY IMPORTANT, BUT... I'LL MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE IF YOU'LL STAY. IT'S ALL I CAN SAY. HE DOESN'T LIKE ASKING FOR ANYTHING, AND WHEN HE BREAKS DOWN AND ASKS YOU TO STAY, IT MEANS A LOT. I CAN HANG OUT AND DO THAT. WELL, I'D APPRECIATE IT, BUT IT'D BE A BIG THING AND IT'D BE A BIG HELP FOR THEM, TOO, YOU KNOW. UNPACK YOUR CRAP IF YOU'RE STAYING. HE'S LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY TO TAKE OVER THE BUSINESS. I KNOW HE WANTS ME TO DO IT, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO DO IT. WELL, TODAY, WEATHER LOOKS GOOD AND WE CAN GO OUT IN THE BOAT. YOU CAN COVER A LOT MORE GROUND WHEN YOU'RE IN A BOAT. AND JUST GLASSING, AND IF WE SEE A BEAR, WE'LL GO AFTER IT. ARE YOU READY TO ROLL, BOB? YOU BETCHA. LET'S GO DO THIS. THE PLAN IS TO HEAD SOUTH FROM THE LODGE, SCOURING THE BEACHES AND CLIFFS ALONG THE COAST OF AFOGNAK ISLAND. IF THE BEARS STAY OUT OF SIGHT, THE PARTY WILL CONTINUE WEST THROUGH KUPREANOF STRAIT TOWARD OUTLET CAPE, AN AREA NOTORIOUS FOR IT'S DENSE BEAR POPULATION. OH, WHAT THE HELL'S THIS OVER HERE? THERE'S A **** WHALE RIGHT THERE. MY GOD. THERE'S A DEAD **** WHALE ON THE BEACH. WHEN YOU HAVE A DEAD WHALE IN AN AREA, IT'LL PULL EVERY BEAR OUT OF AN AREA JUST FROM THAT SMELL. OH, BOB. BOB. BOB! LOOKIT ON THE WHALE. **** OH, WHAT THE HELL'S THIS OVER HERE? THERE'S A **** WHALE RIGHT THERE. MY GOD! THERE'S A DEAD **** WHALE ON THE BEACH! WITH BOB'S GUIDING REPUTATION ON THE LINE, THE HUNT FOR BROWN BEARS ON KODIAK HAS SO FAR BEEN A BUST, UNTIL NOW. LOOK AT THE BEARS UP ON THE BEACH. HOLY **** OH **** IT'S A HERD OF BEARS. WE'VE GOT A HERD OF BEARS. THERE MIGHT BE FIVE OR SIX OTHER BEARS THAT WE DON'T SEE, LAYING UP THERE SLEEPING RIGHT NOW. I KNOW THERE IS. THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM. I NEVER LIKE TO TAKE A SHOT FROM THE BOAT. THAT'S FOOLISH, SO WE HAD TO FIND A PLACE TO PUT THE BOAT. TO GET AN ANGLE ON THAT BEAR, WE GOT TO COME QUITE A WAYS. YEP. YEAH, WE COULD GO IN RIGHT BEHIND THIS POINT RIGHT HERE. ARE WE OUT OF SIGHT OVER THERE, THOUGH? YEAH. I'M NOT SO SURE, BOB. I THINK WE WILL BE. TO GET THE ANGLE THEY NEED, THE HUNTERS WILL SNEAK ONSHORE, UPWIND FROM THE DEAD WHALE, AVOIDING THE BEARS' KEEN SENSE OF SMELL. FROM THERE, THEY WILL HIKE TO A VANTAGE POINT IN THE TREE LINE ABOVE THE BEACH. OKAY, WE GOT TO DO THIS NOW, GUYS, 'CAUSE THE TIDE'S COMING IN. IT'S THE BEST ANGLE ON THE FEEDING BEARS, BUT IT PUTS THE HUNTERS DIRECTLY IN BETWEEN THEM AND ANY NEW BEARS ATTRACTED TO THE WHALE. OKAY, EVERYBODY, SCOPES TURNED DOWN IN CASE WE RUN INTO A BEAR. THIS IS A CALCULATED RISK. THOSE BEARS ARE GONNA PROTECT THAT WHALE, BUT YOU'RE GOING IN ON THEIR KILL AND THAT'S THE KIND OF BEAR YOU DON'T WANT TO WALK INTO. OH, GOD. THERE'S A BIG ONE. THAT'S A BIG ONE THERE. THAT'S A 9-1/2-FOOT BEAR. YEAH, THAT'S A DANDY. YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD BEAR. YEAH, WELL, WE GOT TO LEAVE THE BEACH RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GONNA GET UP ON THIS LITTLE RIDGE AND GET ABOVE HIM. WHEN WE GO INTO THESE WOODS, OUR NECKS BETTER BE ON A 360, BABY, 'CAUSE EVERY BEAR ON THIS PENINSULA IS RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW. THREE MILES SOUTH OF THE LODGE AT GRAVEYARD POINT, ROB AND APPRENTICE GUIDES TROY AND KYLE MOTOR TO THE SCENE OF THE PREVIOUS DAY'S DRIFTWOOD FAILURE. TROY, YOU GET TO DRIVE THE SKIFF. TODAY'S THE DAY THAT WE'RE GONNA GO GET THAT WOOD. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GETTING IN THE WOODS AND HUNTING IS IF WE PROVE TO THEM THAT WE CAN HANDLE THIS APPRENTICE **** YOU KNOW? HELL OR HIGH WATER, WE'RE COMING BACK WITH FIREWOOD. ALL RIGHT, JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR... WE'RE GONNA PULL UP TO THE BEACH. YEAH. YOU JUMP OFF. HOLD THE SKIFF THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT 'CAUSE I'M GONNA CUT THAT OTHER TREE OFF. OKAY. WHAT THE MAIN PLAN IS IS TO GET ME ON THE BEACH. KYLE'S GONNA HOVER OFF THE SHORE A LITTLE BIT, AND AS SOON AS I MAKE THAT CUT AND TIE THE LINES OFF, WE'RE GONNA TOW IT OFF. WELL, WE'RE JUST ABOUT READY TO SEE IF WE CAN TOW THIS OFF. NOW THE NEXT STEP IS GET THE LOG MOVING, START OUR PROCESS OF GETTING THE WOOD OFF THE BEACH. WE'RE TAUT. GO! GO! GO! WHOO! YEAH, BABY. THAT'S A LOG IN THE WATER RIGHT THERE. COMING BACK WITH THIS MUCH WOOD, YOU DEFINITELY FEEL BETTER. I AIN'T GETTING NO ASS-CHEWING TODAY. THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT. HEY, LET'S KEEP OUR HEADS ON A SWIVEL HERE, GUYS. WE'RE ON HIGH ALERT, AND WE PROBABLY GOT EIGHT OR NINE BEARS UP IN THE WOODS. BEARS CAN BLEND. WE CAN BE JUST WALKING RIGHT BY THEM AND NOT SEEING THEM 10 FEET FROM US, AND WE GOT TO SNEAK THROUGH ALL OF THAT. Shh, shh, shh, shh! Be quiet. LOOK RIGHT THERE. SEE THE **** DOWN THERE? THAT'S THE BEAR WE WANT. NEED TO GET IN POSITION. YEAH. WE'RE GONNA COME STRAIGHT DOWN AND GET SET UP RIGHT DOWN HERE. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO DOWN. REAL SLOW, REAL SLOW. SO, WE GOT TO GET BEN IN THERE CLOSE, AND HOPEFULLY, IF THE WIND'S RIGHT, THERE'LL BE A LITTLE LESS SCENT. YOU MAKE A BAD SHOT ON A BEAR, IT GOES DOWNHILL REAL QUICK. THAT BEAR WILL BE COMING IN, HE'LL BE PISSED OFF, HE'S GONNA BE HUNGRY, AND HE'S PROBABLY GONNA KILL YOU. IT'S ABOUT 140, 150 YARDS. DO YOU THINK HE CAN MAKE THAT SHOT? YEAH. - ARE YOU ON HIM? - YEP. MAKE SURE YOU WAIT FOR BOB'S SIGNAL. GOT TO REALLY BE WATCHING BEHIND US, TOO. THE BEST SCENARIO ON ANY ANIMAL IS WHEN THEY'RE QUARTERING AWAY FROM YOU, MEANING THAT THEIR FRONT LEGS ARE FARTHER AWAY THAN THEIR BACK LEGS, AND THAT OPENS UP THE VITAL AREA. KEEP COMING, BABY. KEEP COMING. YOU GOT TO PUT IT RIGHT THROUGH THE HEART. YOU WANT A CLEAN KILL FOR THAT ANIMAL. YOU DON'T WANT HIM TO SUFFER. WHEN YOU'RE READY. OH, THIS IS... BOB, THAT OTHER BEAR SAW US. YEAH, I THINK HE'S ONTO US. WHEN YOU'RE READY. OH, THIS IS... BOB, THAT OTHER BEAR SAW US. YEAH, I THINK HE'S ONTO US. THAT'S A GOOD SHOT RIGHT THERE. TAKE IT. NOW, NOW, NOW! PEG HIM AGAIN. HIT HIM AGAIN, HIT HIM AGAIN. THAT'S IT. GET OUT OF HERE, YOU BIG DOG. IT'S TOUGH WHEN YOU TAKE A BEAR. WHEN YOU WALK UP TO AN ANIMAL THAT'S SUCH A MONARCH, IT'S A SOLEMN MOMENT. IF YOU DON'T FEEL SOMETHING, YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE THERE HUNTING. HEY, GUYS, I ALWAYS KIND OF SAY A LITTLE PRAYER OVER A BEAR, JUST THANKING HIM, YOU KNOW, AND THANK HIM FOR OUR SAFETY AND EVERYTHING ON THIS HUNT, AND GOT TO THANK HIM FOR GIVING UP HIS LIFE, YOU KNOW? THE TIDE'S COMING UP. ERNIE AND I HAVE GOT TO GO GET TO THAT SKIFF OVER THERE, AND WE GOT TO GET BACK HERE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH HIM. TYPICALLY, WE SKIN BEARS RIGHT WHERE WE KILL THEM, BUT THE TIDE'S COMING IN AND WE'RE GONNA LOSE THIS BEAR AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. AND THERE ARE BEARS EVERYWHERE - LOTS OF BEARS. I WANT YOU GUYS TO STAY HERE. KEEP AN EYE ON THIS BEAR SO NO BEARS COME IN AND GRAB HIM AND DRAG HIM OFF. WE GOT TO GET THE BOAT IN AND GET THIS DONE. ALL I WANTED TO DO IS GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE AND GO HOME. BACK AT THE LODGE, KYLE AND TROY'S FIREWOOD CHORE IS FAR FROM OVER. SO, BOB'S GONNA BE PRETTY PLEASED WITH US WHEN HE SEES HOW MUCH WOOD WE GOT. IT SHOULD TAKE THEM AT LEAST 7 HOURS TO CUT THE 30-FOOT SPRUCE INTO USABLE LOGS. IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD - ME, YOU, AND ROB BUCKING IT UP AND CHOPPING IT. YEAH, WITH THREE OF US, I THINK THE WORK SHOULD GO PRETTY QUICK. GET YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR POCKETS. **** ALMOST DONE WITH THIS. SHE'LL BE PRETTY SHARP. IT'LL GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE LOG. WELL, YOU GUYS BETTER GET ON IT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M OUT OF HERE. I'M GOING HUNTING. I'M JUST ABOUT DONE WITH THE SAW. WHY DON'T WE GET HALFWAY DONE AND THEN HEAD OUT? NO, YOU GUYS GET THE WOOD, I'LL GET THE DINNER. REALLY? YOU'RE ON THE APPRENTICE PROGRAM, I'M NOT. THIS IS SOME BULL**** BEING A GREENHORN IS TOUGH, YOU KNOW, AND MY DAD LEFT ME THE TASK TO GET THESE BOYS IN SHAPE. IT'S GONNA BE HELL ON WHEELS FOR THEM BECAUSE I'M TOUGH, AND AT THE END, THEY'LL EITHER THANK ME OR THEY'LL HATE ME. IT IS WHAT IT IS. OKAY. HOPE YOU'RE DONE BY THE TIME I GET BACK. GET YOUR HANDS OUT OF YOUR POCKETS. YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE FROM THE CITY. **** AT THIS REMOTE LODGE, THE WOODS ARE THE ONLY GROCERY STORE. MY MIND-SET WHEN I'M OUT HUNTING IS, I'M SERIOUS 'CAUSE THAT'S FOOD I'M PUTTING ON THE PLATE. I'M HUNTING BY MYSELF, SO IT'S VERY DANGEROUS. YOU GOT TO BE ON YOUR TOES ALL THE TIME. BEING OUT HERE IN THE WOODS BY MYSELF, I THINK A LOT ABOUT MY DAD, THE FUTURE OF THIS PLACE AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH IT. THE MAY LEGACY UP HERE IN ALASKA IS PRETTY HARD TO CARRY. YES, INDEED. SO, A LOT OF WEIGHT ON MY SHOULDERS. COMMERCIAL FISHING COMES AND GOES. FAMILY'S EVERYTHING. I RESPECT MY DAD A LOT. HE MADE ME WHO I AM TODAY. IT'S TIME FOR ME TO STEP UP AND HELP HIM. THAT DEER'S DEFINITELY DOWN RIGHT THERE. I SAW THAT ONE. FAST KILL'S ALWAYS A GOOD KILL. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. WELL, WE BETTER GET THIS GUTTED OUT BEFORE A BEAR COMES AND FINDS US. SEVEN MILES AWAY, NEAR OUTLET CAPE... ...HUNTER BEN AND HIS FATHER, GREG, STAND GUARD AT THEIR BEAR WHILE BOB AND ERNIE RETRIEVE THE BOAT. THEY'LL NEED TO RECOVER THIS ANIMAL FAST BEFORE THE RISING SURF SWALLOWS IT INTO THE BAY. WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO SKIN THIS BEAR. WE'RE GONNA LOSE IT. SO, WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING I'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. BOB THINKS IT'LL WORK. IS ANYBODY ELSE HERE REAL GOOD WITH KNOTS? MY IDEA IS TO TOW THE BEAR. LET'S TIE A LINE ON IT AND GET IT THE HELL OUT OF HERE. GONNA THROW A KNOT AROUND EACH OF HIS BACK LEGS, GONNA PUT A BUOY AROUND HIS NECK. WE'RE GONNA TOW HIM SIX MILES. IT'S JUST CRAZY. YOU'RE DOING GOOD, DOING GOOD. DOING GOOD. THERE YOU GO! WE'RE ON OUR WAY. I'M GETTING A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT THIS WEATHER HERE. VERY UNPREDICTABLE. I MEAN, THEY WEREN'T CALLING FOR THIS. MY MAIN THOUGHT WAS, BOY, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT BEAR AND HAVE THE LINE SNAP AND HAVE THE BEAR SINK. I'M THINKING HOW HARD THAT WE WERE CHASING THAT BEAR. AND TO LOSE AN ANIMAL - MY GOD, THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN THAT. THIS STUFF IS WET. YEAH. EVERYTHING'S WET. IT'S BEEN RAINING NONSTOP ALL DAY. KODIAK'S KNOWN FOR ROUGH WEATHER, A LOT OF TIDES, A LOT OF WIND. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, EVEN WITHOUT THE BROWN BEARS HERE, YOU CAN DIE HERE PRETTY DAMN EASY. IT'S AN ISLAND OFF THE SOUTHERN COAST OF ALASKA. IT GETS ALL THE NASTY WEATHER THAT BLOWS OUT OF THE BERING. IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, YOU CAN HAVE A STORM MOVE IN AND BE IN THE HARSHEST WEATHER CONDITIONS YOU'VE EVER SEEN. THE ENVIRONMENT HERE ON KODIAK, IT CAN BE DANGEROUS, IT CAN BE BEAUTIFUL, IT CAN BE YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY. IT'S DEFINITELY DANGEROUS. IF YOU PLAN FOR A DAY TO BE CALM AND YOU'RE NOT PREPARED FOR IT, YOU CAN GET IT TROUBLE REAL QUICK. PUMMELED BY HEAVY SEAS, BOB AND ERNIE RACE TO STAY AHEAD OF A SUBARCTIC STORM... ...SLOWED DOWN BY 1,300 POUNDS OF KODIAK BEAR THEY'RE DRAGGING BACK TO CAMP. WE'VE GOT ABOUT ANOTHER TWO MILES TO THE LODGE. ANYBODY OUT THERE ABLE TO PICK UP THE FORECAST THERE FOR SHELIKOF STRAIT? NOBODY OUT HERE? I CAN'T GET AHOLD OF ANYBODY. THERE'S NOBODY OUT HERE, AND NOBODY'S ANSWERING THE RADIO. WE'RE OUT HERE ALONE IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. WE'RE TOWING A 1,300-POUND BEAR. THESE ROPES ARE AT THEIR LIMIT AND I LOOK OVER AT BOB, AND I CAN SEE HE'S WORRIED. I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM SO FREAKED OUT IN MY LIFE. WELL, IT'S THE CABIN. WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT THERE. GOT TO LOVE IT. IT'S A HAPPY MOMENT. THERE'S NOTHING EASY IN THIS LODGE BUSINESS. IT'S DEFINITELY A CHALLENGE EVERY DAY, BUT IT'S NICE TO SEE WHEN THINGS ARE WORKING. YOU GOT TO WORK HARD TO GAIN PEOPLE'S RESPECT UP HERE, SO THAT'S WHAT I DO. WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, IT'S BEEN A PLEASURE HUNTING WITH YOU GUYS. KODIAK BROWN BEARS HAVE BEEN SUSTAINING LIFE ON THIS ISLAND FOR THOUSANDS OF YEAR. THE NATIVE'S ATE THEM. WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE BACKSTRAPS OFF THIS BEAR, WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE HINDQUARTERS, MAKE SOME SAUSAGE. THAT'S A FLOATING BEAR. OH, FORGOT ONE! OH! OH! YEAH! YOU DON'T DO STUFF OUT HERE HALF-ASS, AND YOU GOT TO GET THAT INSTILLED IN THESE YOUNG GUIDES, TOO, THAT THEY HAVE TO DO THINGS RIGHT BECAUSE THIS ISLAND WILL KILL YOU. KYLE, TROY! YO! ME AND KYLE, WE'VE BEEN JUST BUSTING OUR ASSES, AND HOPEFULLY THE GUYS HAVE SEEN IT AND THEY'RE GONNA KICK US A LITTLE BIT OF A REWARD. I DON'T WHAT IT IS - GO HUNTING, GO FISHING. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS, JUST LET ME DO SOMETHING. I'M READY FOR THE CHALLENGE. I'M READY TO STEP UP. HOLY SMOKES! WE'RE GONNA NEED 10 PEOPLE TO BRING THIS THING IN. HE'S A BIG BOY. THIS SEASON ON "KODIAK"... THERE'S ABOUT A THOUSAND WAYS YOU CAN DIE OUT HERE. NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT ON KODIAK. YOU DON'T SEE THAT BEAR COMING, HE'S GONNA KILL YOUR ASS. NO ROADS, THERE'S NO REAL ACCESS TO ANYTHING, SO UNLESS YOU'RE DOING IT YOURSELF, WHO ELSE ARE YOU GONNA RELY ON? YEAH, A WOMAN'S PLACE IN ALASKA IS WHEREVER THE HELL SHE WANTS TO BE. I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT ALASKA, AND IT MADE US WHO WE ARE. THAT BEAR WAS BACK IN THERE ABOUT 150 YARDS. DON'T WANT TO PUT HIM IN A COFFIN. THAT'S PART OF THE GAME. RUN! RUN! WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE. WATCH OUT! WHEW! THAT ALWAYS GETS YOUR **** BLOOD GOING. Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
