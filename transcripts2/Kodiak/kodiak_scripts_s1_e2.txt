 YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO, AND I'LL DO IT. Narrator: IN SEARCH OF FOOD, THE ISLAND'S KODIAK BEARS ARE ON THE PROWL... [ BEAR GRUNTS ] Bob M.: THESE ARE THE LARGEST CARNIVORES ON EARTH, AND YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL. THAT'S OVER A 9-FOOT BEAR, AND YOU CAN SEE HIS TRAIL. HE IS MOVING. Narrator: ...AND BOB AND ERNIE HAVE THEIR FIRST RUN-IN. Bob M.: MAKE A MISTAKE, YOU COULD DIE. GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN! [ BEAR GROWLS ] CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS Bob M.: BOY, THAT NORTHERLY WIND, MAN,

 YOU CAN SURE FEEL WINTER COMING, HUH? THAT CABIN IS JUST AS COLD AS AN ICEBOX WITHOUT THAT FLOOR INSULATED. Narrator: ON KODIAK ISLAND, WINTER IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER. LEGENDARY GUIDE BOB MAY AND HIS SON, ROBERT, ARE MAKING LAST-MINUTE REPAIRS TO THE LODGE IN THE DOWNTIME BETWEEN GUESTS. BET YOU WITH THIS WEATHER, IT COULD SNOW TOMORROW, HUH? YEP. MAN, IT'S TIGHT UNDER HERE FOR A OLD, FAT GUY. Narrator: 40 MILES OFF THE COAST OF ALASKA ON THE NORTHERN PART OF KODIAK ISLAND IS THE MAYS' LODGE. EVERY FALL, THE MAYS, ALONG WITH TWO OTHER GUIDING FAMILIES, MAKE THIS REMOTE CAMP THEIR HOME, LIVING OFF THE LAND, STOCKPILING GAME TO GET THEM THROUGH THE HARSH ALASKAN WINTER, AND GUIDING HUNTERS INTO THE ISLAND'S DANGEROUS INTERIOR. OKAY, HAND ME ONE. WHY DON'T YOU LET ME UNDER THERE? IN A LAND THIS ROUGH, THE MAYS AND THEIR FRIENDS HAVE NO ONE TO DEPEND ON BUT EACH OTHER. WE'RE LOSING A LOT OF HEAT THROUGH THE FLOOR. IT'S CAUSING US TO BURN A LOT MORE WOOD. Narrator: AFTER MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF GUIDING, BOB IS STARTING TO THINK ABOUT HIS LEGACY. IT WAS KIND OF A HARD DECISION TO ASK ROBERT NOT TO GO FISHING. I REALLY DON'T WANT YOU TO GO, MAN. I NEED YOU KIND OF HERE. I'M GLAD HE'S MADE THE CHOICE TO STICK WITH ME AND GIVE ME A HAND, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, MAKES ME PROUD. FALL WAS YESTERDAY. WINTER'S TODAY. THAT'S HOW FAST **** CHANGES AROUND HERE. THE MAY LEGACY UP HERE IN ALASKA IS PRETTY HARD TO CARRY, AND IT'S A LOT OF WEIGHT ON MY SHOULDERS. I THINK I HEAR A PLANE. I FEEL HONORED MOST OF THE TIME THAT SOMEBODY CALLS ME TO TAKE THEM BEAR HUNTING. Narrator: BOB MAY'S REPUTATION AS A GUIDE IS KNOWN THE WORLD OVER. HE'S LED SPORTS FIGURES, CELEBRITIES, AND C. E. O. s INTO THE KODIAK BACKWOODS. Bob M.: MOST PEOPLE, MAN, THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY CONCRETE ALL THE TIME. I'M GONNA TRY MY HARDEST TO GET THEM TO THEIR EXPERIENCE SPENDING TIME OUT IN THE WOODS. TODAY, I HAVE A HUNTER COMING IN, JULIAN, BUT HE'S BRINGING A BOW. THAT ALWAYS MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS. THAT'S THAT JULIAN RIGHT THERE. Julian: MOST OF US WHO LIVE IN CITIES CONJURE UP ALL KINDS OF IDEAS ABOUT WHO WE ARE, SO I CAME TO KODIAK ISLAND BECAUSE IT TESTS YOUR ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE IT IN A LIFE- AND-DEATH SITUATION. JULIAN. NICE TO MEET YOU, MR. FAMOUS GUY. [ CHUCKLES ] I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT. YOU ALL READY FOR THIS? I WAS BORN FOR THIS. YOU KNOW, KIND OF LIVE OFF THE LAND WHILE WE'RE OUT HERE. THAT SOUNDS GREAT. IT'D BE GOOD IF WE COULD MAYBE TAKE A SHOT WITH YOUR BOW IF YOU WANT TO? I'D LIKE TO. IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I SHOT. OH, ALL RIGHTY. YEAH. OKAY. [ BIRD CAWS ] Narrator: ON THE OTHER SIDE OF CAMP, BROTHERS AND APPRENTICE GUIDES KYLE AND TROY HOLLAND SET THEIR SIGHTS ON A TARGET OF THEIR OWN. Kyle: YOU SEE THE ONE ON THE RIGHT? Troy: YEP. GUIDING - YOU NEED THREE YEARS APPRENTICING, SO THIS WILL BE MY THIRD YEAR, HOPEFULLY MY LAST YEAR. ALMOST IN POSITION. Kyle: I'M HOPING THAT THIS IS THE YEAR THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO PROVE TO THESE GUYS THAT WE CAN BE FULL GUIDES. ALL RIGHT. CLEAR TO TARGET. YOU READY? YEP. ALL RIGHT, TROY. GOING LIVE. CLEAR TO SHOOT. FIRING. IT'S A KILL SHOT, RIGHT IN THE GOOD ZONE. [ RIFLE COCKS ] LOOKS LIKE THIS GUN'S SIGHTED IN. YEP. YOU WANT TO DO THE OTHER ONE? Ernie: HEY, GUYS. HEY, DAD. WHAT'S UP, DAD? DID YOU GET THE GUNS SIGHTED IN? YEAH. DID YOU GET YOUR CHORES DONE? YEAH, WE GOT ALL OUR CHORES DONE. WHEN KYLE AND TROY WERE KIDS, ALL THEY WANTED TO DO WAS BECOME BEAR GUIDES. Boy: HEY, DAD. YEAH? WHEN AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO SHOOT THAT 20-GAUGE? WHEN YOU TURN ABOUT 40, SON. OH, BE QUIET. I DON'T WANT THEM TO BE GUIDES RIGHT NOW. THE KODIAK BROWN BEAR IS A KILLING MACHINE, AND IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THEM, AM I GONNA BLAME MYSELF? ABSOLUTELY. SO, AS LONG AS I CAN KEEP THEM DOING CHORES, THEY'RE GONNA BE DOING CHORES. WATER LINE'S RUNNING? RUNNING. WOOD'S CUT AND STACKED AND READY TO GO? YEP. I GOT ONE MORE FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT. GOT THE CUSACKS COMING, GOT A NEW HUNTER. WE NEED A NEW OUTHOUSE. NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUILD ONE, BUT YOU GOT TO DIG A NEW HOLE AND YOU GOT TO MOVE IT. IT'S GOT TO BE SMELLING LIKE DAISIES. Troy: BEING AN APPRENTICE, YOU KIND OF GET THE LOWER END OF THE TOTEM POLE FOR JOBS. AND WE HAVE TO DO IT? YEP. IT'S GOT TO BE DONE. YOU JUST GOT TO ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES AND KEEP YOUR HEAD UP BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT SOMEDAY, YOU ARE GONNA MAKE IT TO THAT GUIDE LEVEL. THIS IS WHAT GUIDING'S ABOUT - TAKING CARE OF CLIENTS, TAKING CARE OF PEOPLE. YEAH, WE CAN DO IT. OKAY. THANKS, GUYS. ALL RIGHT. Kyle: TROY AND I, AS APPRENTICE GUIDES, WE PUT IN OUR DUES AND WE JUST KEEP OUR MOUTHS SHUT AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING RUNS AS SMOOTH AS POSSIBLE. YOU KNOW, FOR A SECOND THERE, I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA SAY WE WERE GONNA GET THE NEW HUNTER. YEAH **** NOT THIS TIME, BOYS. Julian: YEAH, I LIKE THIS LITTLE BOW. IT'S A LITTLE OLD, BUT I'M USED TO IT. Bob M.: WE REALLY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR HUNTERS ARE PROFICIENT AND CAN SHOOT AND SAY, "HEY, DOES THIS GUY GOT WHAT IT TAKES?" AND THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT WE DO. Bob M.: WELL, HOW'S THIS RANGE FOR YOU? I'D SAY THAT'S ABOUT 29 YARDS RIGHT THERE. OKAY. THE PROBLEM WITH HUNTING WITH A BOW IS, YOU KNOW, MOST OF THE TIME, YOU CAN'T SEE MUCH FURTHER THAN 25 TO 50 YARDS. A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN 20 YARDS. THEY CAN TRAVEL 40 MILES AN HOUR. THEY CAN RUN DOWN A RACEHORSE IF THEY WANTED. THESE BEARS WEIGH 1,300 POUNDS, THEY'VE GOT 6-INCH CLAWS, SO YOU CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM TO KNOW WHERE THAT ARROW CAME FROM. YOU'RE AT 24, GUYS. 24. Ernie: IF YOU'RE GONNA HUNT BROWN BEARS WITH BOWS, YOU NEED TO BE FOCUSED, YOU NEED TO PRACTICED, AND YOU NEED TO BE PERFECT. YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT AN ARROW NOT 9 OUT OF 10 TIMES, 10 OUT OF 10 TIMES IN AN AREA LIKE THAT. IF WE CAN GET IT IN THAT ORANGE, I'D BE A HAPPY CAMPER. WHENEVER YOU'RE COMFORTABLE. OKAY. YOU READY? YEP. A LITTLE HIGH. EH. A LITTLE BIT HIGH. TRY THAT AGAIN. WAY LOW. THAT BEAR CAN COVER 20 YARDS SO FAST, YOU CAN'T EVEN HARDLY GET ANOTHER ROUND IN YOUR GUN, LET ALONE AN ARROW. MY JOB IS NOT ONLY FOR A CLEAN KILL TO THAT ANIMAL, BUT MY HUNTER'S SAFETY AND MY GUIDE'S SAFETY IS SERIOUS STUFF. I MEAN, PEOPLE DIE. [ ROARS ] IT'S CENTERED BUT TO THE RIGHT. WELL, THAT'S STILL OFF THE MARK A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW? HE'S NOT A COMPETENT ENOUGH BOW HUNTER TO TAKE A BROWN BEAR WITH A BOW, PERIOD. TOOK US JUST A FEW SECONDS TO SEE THAT HE WASN'T READY. I WOULDN'T ALLOW IT, AND BOB WOULDN'T ALLOW IT. THIS IS GONNA BE A RIFLE HUNT, GUYS. IS THAT OKAY? I'M GOOD WITH THAT. THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME. Ernie: JULIAN, I COULD SEE IT IN HIS FACE, KNEW HIMSELF HE WASN'T READY. HE WAS DREAMING. SO WE'RE GONNA TAKE HIM OUT RIFLE HUNTING. WELL, WE'LL BE HUNTING FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. [ OWLS HOOTS ] BOY, THIS SKIFF IS DIRTIER THAN **** HOW COME THE BOYS DIDN'T CLEAR HER? Narrator: AS DAWN BREAKS, THE HUNTING PARTY HEADS 6 MILES NORTHWEST UP THE AFOGNAK RIVER TO HATCHERY CREEK. IT'S A SPAWNING GROUND FOR SALMON, A STAPLE OF THE BROWN BEAR'S DIET. JULIAN, DO YOU SEE WHERE THE SUN IS THERE ON THAT MOUNTAIN? YEAH. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE HEADING TODAY. Bob M.: WE'VE GOT A POPULATION OF PROBABLY 3,500 BEARS HERE ON THE ISLAND. EVERY YEAR, THEY GIVE US ABOUT 200 BEARS TO KILL. Narrator: CONTROLLED HUNTING IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF KEEPING THE BEAR POPULATION HEALTHY. Bob M.: A LOT OF TIMES, IF THEY OVERPOPULATE, THEY START GETTING INTO TOWNS, AND THEY CAN KILL YOU. AND THEN, MOST LIKELY, THEY'RE GONNA EAT YOU. ALL RIGHT. We are in the heart of brown bear country right now. Got to be on our toes, because they can be anywhere. You can see how tall the grass is here. Ernie: KODIAK BROWN BEARS, THEY CAN JUST BLEND IN. THEY CAN WALK UP ON YOU, AND YOU WOULD NEVER EVEN KNOW THEY WERE THERE. There's always bears moving in and out. Try not to scuff your feet, make any noise walking. These bears are gonna be getting their last meal for the winter, so... That's what we're banking on, anyway. Bob M.: A SQUIRREL MAKES MORE NOISE THAN A KODIAK BEAR DOES GOING THROUGH THE WOODS. IT'S LIKE WE'VE CLIMBED OVER THEIR FENCE AND WE'RE STANDING IN THEIR BACKYARD, AND THEY KNOW WHERE EVER LEAF, EVERY TWIG, EVERY HIDING SPOT IS, AND THEY DEFINITELY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE WOODS. BOB M.: Got to be on our toes. And if we run into a bear, even if he's charging, it's gonna be up to you. I'm not gonna shoot unless I have to, all right? Okay. ERNIE: We have spawning salmon here that are coming up into these streams here. The bears are in hyperphagia right now, which means they're putting on as much fat as they can so that they can go in and den, and this is an easy protein source for them. Bob M.: MOST OF THE TIME WHEN YOU'RE WALKING AROUND IN THESE WOODS, YOU ALMOST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BEING WATCHED... [ CROWS CAWING ] ...BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES YOU ARE. AND USUALLY IT'S MISTER BROWN THAT'S WATCHING YOU. That's the fishing hole right there. It's a good spot to watch for a bear. Ernie. Psst! Narrator: MASTER GUIDES BOB MAY AND ERNIE HOLLAND HAVE BEEN STAKING OUT HATCHERY CREEK FOR THE PAST SIX HOURS. THEY HOPE TO FIND A FEEDING KODIAK BEAR BEFORE IT FINDS THEM. Could've been fish. [ INDISTINCT WHISPERING ] WHEN ERNIE AND I ARE GUIDING, WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING. WE JUST BASICALLY LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND KNOW WHAT THE OTHER GUY WANTS TO DO. THERE'S NO BETTER MAN THAT I'D RATHER HAVE BEHIND ME GOING INTO A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAN ERNIE. I MEAN, HE'S STONE-COLD WHEN IT COMES TO THAT MOMENT, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO BE. I'd like to go down there and look, you know, look around that fishing hole down there. ERNIE: You guys, look. I think we interrupted a bear. At least we know that there's a good bear working in here, and there's still fish up here. So, we got to come back up here. Bob M.: WHEN YOU START SEEING SIGN LIKE DEAD FISH LAYING THERE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW YOU'RE CLOSE, BUT IT'S A DANGEROUS ANIMAL TO HUNT. AND THEY'RE SMART. AND THEY KNOW WHY YOU'RE THERE. AND PRETTY SOON, THEY JUST GET TIRED OF BEING CHASED, AND THEY'LL TURN AROUND AND FIGHT. WE WERE RIGHT ON TOP OF THAT BEAR. IT STARTED GETTING DARK, AND WE DON'T OWN THE WOODS WHEN IT GETS DARK. SO, TOMORROW MORNING, WE'RE GONNA BE BACK LOOKING FOR THIS BIG BEAR THAT'S UP THERE. AND HOPEFULLY, HE'S GONNA COME RIGHT TO US. [ INSECTS CHIRPING ] [ OWL HOOTS ] [ As Tattoo from "Fantasy Island"] DE PLANE, DE PLANE! SEÃ‘OR, DE PLANE! Narrator: EVERY FALL, THE MAYS AND THE HOLLANDS ARE JOINED BY A THIRD GUIDING FAMILY - THE CUSACKS. ROBERT, MY BOY, HOW YOU DOING? GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? GOD DANG IT, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD. ANYTHING EXCITING GOING ON? JUST SOME BEARS. BEARS? KILLED A BEAR LAST WEEK. Bob C.: I'M BOB CUSACK. I'VE BEEN HUNTING FOR 45 YEARS HERE IN ALASKA, AND I'M A MASTER GUIDE. I'VE KNOWN ERNIE FOR ABOUT 30 YEARS. MOST OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS, LIKE ERNIE AND BOB - HONEST GUYS THAT YOU CAN COUNT ON. WE HELP EACH OTHER OUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN. Robert: HELLO. GOOD TO SEE YOU. I HAVE MY TWO DAUGHTERS WITH ME, NICOLE AND MARISA. THEY GREW UP IN ALASKA. IT'S IN THEIR BLOOD, TOO. CURRENTLY, I'M AN ATTORNEY IN SAN DIEGO. I'M IN A POINT IN MY LIFE WHERE I'M KIND OF DOING A CHECK - HOW I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE GOING FORWARD. EVEN THOUGH IT'S SUNNY AND EASY IN SAN DIEGO, I ALWAYS FEEL MORE MYSELF AND MORE AT HOME UP HERE. YOU'RE BACK, GIRLS. LET'S GO HAVE SOME FUN. ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT THAT TARGET THING SET UP? Marisa: OUR FAMILY, THE CUSACKS, AND THE HOLLANDS AND THE MAYS ALL SHARE THIS PART OF ALASKA. WE'RE ALL RELIANT ON EACH OTHER FOR DIFFERENT THINGS, SO IT'S WHAT WE DO OUT HERE. Bob C.: I'D LIKE TO DO A LITTLE SHOOTING. Nicole: YEAH. Robert: SOUNDS GOOD. I WANT TO DO IT. I WANT TO PRACTICE. WELL, I KNOW YOU GOT YOUR GUNS. WELL, I ACTUALLY GOT DEER TAGS IN TOWN, 'CAUSE I WAS THINKING MAYBE IF IT'S NOT TOO EARLY... YOU BOUGHT DEER TAGS? WELL, I GOT A DEER TAG, YEAH. HMM. WELL, THAT'S A SERIOUS MOVE, I GOT TO SAY THAT. EVEN THOUGH HUNTING WAS ALWAYS A PART OF MY FAMILY'S BUSINESS, I NEVER WENT HUNTING. I WANTED TO AT ONE POINT, BUT MY MOM WAS AFRAID THAT ONCE I REALIZED WHAT I'D DONE, IT WOULD AFFECT ME IN A WAY THAT COULDN'T BE TAKEN BACK. YOU'RE SURE YOU WANT TO DO IT? 'CAUSE ONCE YOU TAKE A LIFE, YOU TAKE A LIFE. I KNOW. I'M - I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT. I'M TAKING IT SERIOUSLY. I WANT TO SEE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR MY DAD - WHAT HE'S BEEN DOING ALL OF THESE YEARS, WHAT HE'S SO PASSIONATE ABOUT. AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT HOME, AND THEN COOKING IT FOR EVERYBODY. I MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING ALMOST SPIRITUAL ABOUT BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. Robert: IF YOU WANT TO GO, WE'LL GO. WE GOT OUR HOLE DUG. IT LOOKS PLENTY DEEP. Troy: OUT HERE AT THE LODGE, THERE'S NO SEPTIC SYSTEM, THERE'S NO SEWER SYSTEM. SO, THE ONLY WAY TO GO TO THE BATHROOM, YOU GOT TO BUILD YOUR OWN OUTHOUSES, OTHERWISE YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE LAND MINES ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE JUST NEED TO DIG AROUND HERE TO THESE POSTS, MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED ENOUGH, AND THEN WE CAN ASK ROBERT TO HELP US JUST SAW THOSE POINTS OFF. [ CHAIN SAW BUZZING ] ALL RIGHT, ARE WE LOOSE? Robert: WHEN I FIRST MET KYLE AND TROY, TROY WAS JUST A LITTLE **** I THINK HE EVEN HAD A DIAPER ON. FEELS PRETTY LOOSE. KYLE AND I WERE KIND OF AT THE TROUBLE-MAKING YEARS, SO WE WERE ALWAYS RUNNING AROUND, CUTTING TREES DOWN THAT WE WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE. AND NOW I'M IN CHARGE OF WHAT THEY DO. LET'S TRY AND GET A COUPLE OF 2x4s RIGHT HERE. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT ON THEIR BIG-BOY BRITCHES, BECAUSE BY DOING ALL THIS **** WORK, IT CREATES A WORK ETHIC FOR THEM. YOU READY TO MOVE IT? [ Straining ] OH, GOD. DO NOT FALL IN. MOVING AN OVERFLOWING OUTHOUSE TO A NEW HOLE AND STEPPING OVER THAT **** PILE - IT'S PROBABLY THE GREATEST JOB I'VE EVER HAD. ARE WE OVER THE HOLE? OH **** YEAH, THAT STINKS. UGH! OHH. IN ALL HONESTY, YEAH, NO, IT SUCKED, BUT YOU GOT TO JUST ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES. GET IT DONE, ON TO THE NEXT JOB. CAN I PLEASE COVER THAT UP NOW? JUST KEEP WORKING THAT MOUND OF **** OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT WE CAN WALK IN THERE AND THEN LAY GRAVEL OVER THE TOP OF IT, AND IT'S GOOD TO GO. I'M TAKING OFF, GOING DEER HUNTING WITH NICOLE. YOU GUYS ARE ON YOUR **** OWN. THANKS. Robert: BEING A GREENHORN IS TOUGH, YOU KNOW? I'VE BEEN ON THE OTHER END, TOO. YOU GOT TO LOVE TO HATE IT AND HATE TO LOVE IT. IF THEY'RE PISS-POOR GUYS, IT REFLECTS ON THE LODGE. Kyle: I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GONNA GET US ANY CLOSER TO GOING OUT HUNTING, BUT AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE CHECKED OFF EVERY TASK THAT THEY GAVE US FOR TODAY. THOSE OLD MEN AND THEIR LAUNDRY LIST OF CHORES. OH, YEAH. Narrator: 10 MILES NORTH, MASTER GUIDES BOB AND ERNIE AND THEIR CLIENT JULIAN ARE ON DAY 2 OF THEIR BEAR HUNT. BOB M.: Let's go. YESTERDAY, A LOT OF SIGN, LOT OF FRESH FISH. THERE'S DEFINITELY A BIG BEAR IN THIS AREA. SO. WE'RE GONNA MOVE WITH THE WIND IN OUR FACE AND HOPE THAT WE CAN SPOT THE BEAR BEFORE HE SPOTS US. Bob M.: BEARS CAN DISAPPEAR. THEY CAN WALK RIGHT UP BEHIND YOU AND YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE THERE. THEY'RE STALKERS. Right there. ERNIE: Look at that. Fresh scat. There's no spruce needles on top of that at all, so I know that that was within the last, basically, 24 hours. He's a big bear. BIG TURD, BIG BEAR. LITTLE TURD, LITTLE BEAR. Do you remember seeing that? BOB M.: That was definitely not there. Boy, they're eating every bit of the fish except for that lower jaw. ABOUT THIS TIME OF YEAR IS WHEN THEY START SWITCHING BACK OVER TO THEIR MEAT DIET. WHEN THAT SWITCH COMES, EVERYTHING'S EDIBLE TO THEM. AND THAT INCLUDES US. Got to really be watching behind us. There's bear tracks right there. See them going up the hill? JULIAN: Yeah. He's a good 9 plus. That's good sign. Let's just try predator calling for about 10 minutes, see if we can pull anything. Ernie: BEAR CALLING IS MIMICKING A DEER THAT'S BEEN INJURED, AND IT'S JUST LITERALLY RINGING THE BEAR DINNER BELL. SAYING, "COME EAT ME." Bob M.: YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IN CALLING IN BEARS. SOME SAY I'M CRAZY, AND, I MEAN, IT'S DANGEROUS. I WON'T SAY I'M THE FIRST GUY THAT DID IT, BUT I'M DAMN NEAR THE FIRST GUY THAT DID IT. YOU KNOW, ANYBODY CAN SHOOT A BEAR AT 200 YARDS, BUT CAN YOU DO IT AT 25 YARDS? [ PREDATOR CALL SOUNDING ] Just be ready, Julian, because if this bear comes in, he's gonna be coming in to eat. Narrator: SIX MILES FROM CAMP, AT THE SALMON SPAWNING GROUNDS OF HATCHERY CREEK, BOB, ERNIE, AND JULIAN ATTEMPT TO DRAW A KODIAK BEAR RIGHT TO THEM. [ PREDATOR CALL SOUNDING ] Ernie: WHEN BOB MAY STARTS BLOWING ON THAT PREDATOR CALL, THE HAIR STANDS UP ON THE BACK OF MY NECK. I MEAN, EVERY SENSE IS AT ITS HIGHEST. Come on, come on. Bob M.: USUALLY GET A BEAR RIGHT AWAY, FIRST TIME I CALL ON THE CALL. BUT THIS TIME, WE JUST DIDN'T SEE ANY BEARS. Psst! Since I squealed on that, let's go ahead and move out of here before it gets dark. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ANIMAL THAT'S REALLY SMART, CAN SORT THINGS OUT, AND IF YOU START TRACKING A BEAR, MOST TIMES THEY KNOW IT, YOU KNOW? THEY'LL FIGURE OUT THAT SOMEBODY'S CHASING THEM. Once it gets dark, they definitely have the upper hand. It's pretty dicey in there right now. PRETTY DAMN FRUSTRATING. AND SUCCESS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS BEAR. I think tonight we better eat some big-ball soup, and give it another try tomorrow. [ OWL HOOTS ] ROBERT: This is a trail I made when I was in high school. My dad likes hunting the back side. I like hunting this area down through here. Narrator: IN THE HILLS ABOVE CAMP, ROB LEADS THE CUSACKS OUT TO GET DINNER. Robert: KODIAK'S HOME. THIS WHOLE ISLAND'S MY BACKYARD. Narrator: AND NO ONE KNOWS THESE WOODS AS WELL AS HE DOES. Robert: WHATEVER I SHOOT IS ON THE TABLE, AND THAT'S THE WAY WE WERE RAISED, YOU KNOW? DON'T WASTE. I'VE SHOT DEER 50 YARDS FROM HERE, SO, BE READY, NICOLE. Nicole: ON KODIAK ISLAND, YOU CAN'T JUST GO TO THE STORE AND PICK THINGS UP. THERE'S NO CIVILIZATION FOR MILES AND MILES. I THINK THAT PUTS EVERYTHING MORE IN PERSPECTIVE. AND SO, I GET TO DO SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A CONNECTION WITH MY DAD ON. I ALSO REALLY LIKE THE CONNECTEDNESS TO THE FOOD. BUT WE'LL SEE HOW THE KILLING PART OF IT GOES FOR ME. ROBERT: That deer trail's pretty worn down. Psst! OKAY. No. Damn it. SOMETHING JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT, SO I DIDN'T - I DIDN'T PULL THE TRIGGER. Robert: IT WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING. WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO KILL THAT BUCK, AND SHE DIDN'T HAVE IT. IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH AS A GUIDE - YOUR HUNTING ABILITIES ARE LIMITED TO YOUR HUNTER. That was so close. Bob C.: HOW'D THE HUNT GO? Ernie: YEAH, IT WAS SLOW. WELL, YOU'LL BE READY FOR A GOOD STEAK, I HOPE. MAN, YEAH. NO KIDDING. I'M COLD. I THINK MAYBE THE BOYS NEED TO GET OUT A LITTLE BIT. GO OUT IN THE FIELD. BOTH OF THEM ARE ENTHUSIASTIC AS HELL. BOTH OF THEM ARE LOOKING AT GUIDING, YOU KNOW? THAT'S THE LAST THING I WANT THEM TO BE. HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GONNA STOP THEM? THOSE TWO OUT BY THEMSELVES HUNTING BEARS, I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT A BIT. BUT I'M WORRYING ABOUT A DUMBASS CLIENT KILLING THEM BECAUSE HE'S SOME BIGWIG THAT THINKS HE KNOWS EVERYTHING, AND HE DOESN'T. THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT. BUT IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO DO IT AND ME TO DO IT, BUT NOT HIM. BUT THESE ARE MY BOYS. Ernie: THE LAST DEATH THAT HAPPENED ON KODIAK... [ SIGHS ] ...IS A REALLY GOOD FRIEND OF MINE. AND I TALKED TO HIM A WEEK BEFORE HE LEFT, AND I ASKED HIM NOT TO TAKE A SMALL-CALIBER RIFLE. [ SNIFFLES ] AND HE DID. AND THE BEAR KILLED HIM. SO, YEAH, IT'S REALLY CLOSE TO ME. DO YOU WANT YOUR KIDS OUT DOING THAT? DO YOU WANT THEM CHASING 1,500-POUND ANIMALS THAT ARE WOUNDED THROUGH THE BUSH... YEAH. ...BECAUSE SOME DUMBASS DIDN'T LISTEN TO THEM AND PUT THEM IN HARM'S WAY? YOU CAN DIE SITTING IN A **** ROCKING CHAIR. I- I DON'T WANT THEM TO DO IT. I DON'T WANT TO PUT THEM IN A COFFIN AND DO ALL THAT. I- I'M AFRAID OF THAT. I DON'T WANT THAT. LET ME PUT THE DOs AND THE DON'Ts IN THERE, YOU KNOW? Bob C.: ERNIE'S GOT TO LEARN TO LET GO. AS A PARENT, IT'S HARD, AND YOU JUST... IT'S GONNA HAPPEN. IF THEY WANT TO DO IT, THEN YOU GOT TO LET GO, BUT YOU'LL ALWAYS BE CONCERNED, YOU KNOW? AND THEY'RE GONNA GO AROUND YOU IF THEY DON'T GO WITH YOU AND WITH US. Bob C.: YOU BOYS HAPPY TO GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE FOR A WHILE? Troy: YEAH, DEFINITELY HAPPY TO BE OUT OF CAMP. Bob C.: ERNIE DEFINITELY WORRIES ABOUT THEM. THE BIGGEST THING I THINK I CAN TEACH KYLE AND TROY IS SAFETY - WITH THE CLIENT AND WITH THEMSELVES. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF MY JOB OUT HERE WITH THOSE BOYS. THAT'S 9 INCHES ACROSS. THAT'S A 9-FOOT BEAR. PROBABLY A 10 FOOT. IT CAN BE AN INCH MORE AS THEY GET BIGGER. Troy: THAT GUY'S A LEGEND, MAN. HE'S BEEN HUNTING THESE BEARS FOR AS LONG AS HE HAS AND IS STILL ALIVE TO TELL US ABOUT IT. I'M GONNA JUST HAVE AN EAR ON EVERY SINGLE THING THAT HE SAYS. THE WHOLE GUIDING THING IS BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE CLIENT. YOU KNOW IF HE'S A GOOD HUNTER, AND YOU ALSO KNOW IF HE'S A NERVOUS BASTARD AND HE'S GOT THE SAFETY OFF AND THE GUN'S GONNA BE UP YOUR BUTT. Troy: WELL, THAT KIND OF STUFF, WE DIDN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT. YOU KIND OF GOT TO BE ON THESE CLIENTS, YOU KNOW? THEY'RE THE ONES HUNTING, BUT WE'RE THE ONES CONTROLLING THE HUNTER. THAT DAMN BEAR WILL CHARGE FASTER THAN HELL. HE'S GOT 10 SWITCHBLADES UP FRONT AND A BIG-ASS MOUTH AND STRONG JAWS. YOU'LL RIDE UP ON HIM, AND "OH, CHRIST," HE'S THERE. Kyle: KODIAK BROWN BEARS ARE KILLERS, AND IF YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG, THEN YOU CAN PUT YOURSELVES IN HARM'S WAY AND PUT YOUR CLIENT IN HARM'S WAY. YOU DON'T SEE THEM. YOU DON'T SEE THEM. WOW. OH, ABSOLUTELY. IT MAKES ME REALIZE JUST HOW HARD BEING A GUIDE IS. MY DAD, HE'S KIND OF DETERRED US FROM WANTING TO GET INTO THE GUIDING BUSINESS. HE KEEPS WANTING TO PUSH US AWAY FROM THE IDEA. WELL, IT'S A DANGEROUS BUSINESS. BUT I THINK IF HE SEES YOU'RE REALLY SAFE, IT'LL WORK ITSELF OUT. AND IF IT DOESN'T, HE'LL CROAK, AND THEN YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. WELL, BY THAT TIME, WHO KNOWS IF WE'LL WANT TO BE GUIDES. [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH. Robert: WE'RE GOING UP A DIFFERENT WAY. WE'LL GO UP ON THIS. WE'RE GONNA HEAD UP AND GET UP ON THE RIDGE. ALL RIGHT. Robert: TODAY, ME AND NICOLE ARE GOING OUT ON OUR OWN, AND HOPEFULLY WE GET THE TRUE HUNTING EXPERIENCE FOR HER AND HAVE A GOOD DAY AND GET A DEER. 'CAUSE WE NEED THE MEAT TO GET BY FOR THE WINTER. [ GASPS ] OH, MY GOSH. Nicole: I FEEL LIKE I'M NOT FULLY AN ALASKAN UNTIL I AT LEAST TRY HUNTING. SO, IT'S BEEN EATING AT ME THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BRING HOME A DEER. [ DEER CALL SOUNDING ] Robert: I USE DEER CALLS TO KIND OF CREATE THE SOUND OF A DOE IN HEAT, AND IT ATTRACTS BUCKS IN. WHEN YOU'RE BLOWING ON ONE OF THESE CALLS, IT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE BEARS CAN COME IN REAL FAST. [ DEER CALL SOUNDING ] [ DEER CALL SOUNDING ] **** Can you see it? No. I don't see it. In the middle of those trees right there. Okay. **** I see him. **** [ GUNSHOT ] **** Oh, no. Did I get it? Mm-hmm. Oh, my God, I'm shaking. HOLY ADRENALINE RUSH. [ CHUCKLES ] [ BREATHING HEAVILY ] OH, MY GOD. IS THAT EXCITING OR WHAT? YEAH. OH, GOD. GOOD JOB. TOUCH THE EYEBALL AND MAKE SURE HE'S DEAD. IF THE EYEBALL BLINKS, HE'S STILL ALIVE. OKAY. OH, MY GOD. I'M SORRY. WELL, YOU ALWAYS KIND OF GOT TO BE SAD ABOUT IT, BECAUSE YOU DID TAKE A LIFE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'RE TAKING LIFE TO CREATE LIFE. Nicole: FOR THOSE OF US THAT EAT MEAT, THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST RESPECTFUL WAY TO GET OUR FOOD. I FEEL CONNECTED. THIS IS GONNA BE AN AWESOME EATING DEER, I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. YOU WANT TO GET YOUR HANDS BLOODY? I DON'T CARE. I MEAN, I MIGHT AS WELL MAKE THIS FASTER, 'CAUSE I'M NOT EXACTLY PUMPED ABOUT A BEAR ROLLING IN. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE MOWGLI COMES ALONG. Narrator: EIGHT MILES WEST, NEAR AFOGNAK LAKE, BOB, ERNIE, AND JULIAN ARE ON THE TRAIL OF A 9-FOOT KODIAK BEAR. THE BEAST HAS KEPT OUT OF SIGHT, MAINTAINING THE UPPER HAND ON THESE HUNTERS FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS. THAT'S THE FRONT PAD OF HIS FOOT. THAT IS A BIG BEAR. THAT'S OVER A 9-FOOT BEAR. Ernie: HUNTING BEARS ON KODIAK IS A GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE. THESE BEARS ARE 26, 27 YEARS OLD. THEY'RE SMART. If you're not a little bit nervous, or even right on the edge of being scared, there's something wrong with you, because, I mean, we're right on top of this bear. That bear is in here somewhere. I'd like to try and pull that bear out of here. [ PREDATOR CALL SOUNDING ] [ WINGS FLAPPING ] I hope that everybody's up for this, because it's gonna happen quick. [ WOODPECKER PECKING ] [ BIRDS CHIRPING ] [ BEAR GRUNTS ] There's a bear right here. Come on, come on. He's right there. I see him. I see him. [ BEAR GRUNTING ] Right here. Right here. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Come around here. Come here, come here. Come here, come here. Right there, right there, right there, right there. See it? It's gonna go - it's going that way. It's going that way. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I see him. [ PREDATOR CALL SOUNDS ] It's coming. I'm gonna call him in. Take him. [ BEAR ROARS ] OH, HIT HIM AGAIN! HIT HIM AGAIN! I'M JAMMED! I think I hear something. KODIAK BROWN BEAR, THEY ARE THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN OUT HERE. NOTHING IS BIGGER AND BADDER THAN THEM. AND IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THEM, THEN YOU DON'T BELONG OUT HERE. THIS IS THE BEAR'S ELEMENT, YOU KNOW? THEY LIVE OUT HERE. HUMANS DON'T. THEY HAVE THE UPPER HAND ALL THE TIME. Bob C.: A LOT OF THEM COME AT YOU DIFFERENTLY, CHARGING YOU LIKE THE SHERMAN TANK, OR SNEAKING UP ON YOU LIKE A PUSSY CAT. Bob M.: THESE ARE THE LARGEST CARNIVORES ON EARTH. YOU'D BETTER BE CAREFUL. THEY WILL HUNT YOU JUST AS MUCH AS YOU'RE HUNTING THEM. Ernie: A FRIEND OF MINE, HE SHOT A BROWN BEAR THAT WAS CHARGING, DIDN'T MAKE A GOOD SHOT. BEAR GOT AHOLD OF HIM, SHOOK HIM, TORE OPEN HIS FEMORAL ARTERY, AND HE BLED TO DEATH. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY JUST NOTHING IN THEIR HANDS. [ GUN COCKS ] [ PREDATOR CALL SOUNDS ] [ BEAR GROWLS ] It's coming right across there. Take him when you can. [ BEAR GRUNTING ] [ BEAR ROARS ] OH, YEAH! **** I'M JAMMED! [ GUNSHOT ] **** THAT WAS CLOSE, YOU GUYS. HOLY **** HE WAS GONNA RUN ME OVER. Ernie: YEAH, THAT THING'S JAMMED. FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, MY GUN JAMMED. IT WAS THE WORST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME IN ALL OF THE TIME I'VE EVER BEEN GUIDING. THAT BEAR WAS COMING TO CHARGE. NO, IT SAW ME, DEFINITELY. IT KNEW WHERE WE WERE. IF BOB HADN'T HAVE BEEN THERE, I WOULD PROBABLY BE DEAD. Bob M.: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN YOU HAVE A BEAR COMING DOWN ON YOU, IT TURNS FROM A HUNT TO A LIFE- AND-DEATH SITUATION. I THINK WE GOT A BEAR, BUDDY. GOOD JOB. IT WAS TIME TO STEP UP AND STOP THAT BEAR. BEAUTIFUL BEAR. THAT'S A NICE BEAR. DANDY. WOW. LOOK AT THE CLAWS ON THAT. LET'S ALL TAKE A KNEE AND SAY A PRAYER. AFTER THE BEAR'S DEAD, EVERYBODY'S RELIEVED BECAUSE EVERYBODY WAS SAFE. YOU CAN LOSE YOUR LIFE OUT HERE, AND MANY PEOPLE HAVE. OH, NO, MY STRAP'S WRONG HERE. GET IT UP THERE. ALL RIGHT, I'M GOOD. GOT TO THANK BOB MAY FOR SAVING MY LIFE TODAY, AND THANK THE BEAR FOR HIS LIFE, TOO. BECAUSE THIS BEAR REALLY GAVE US A GOOD HEAD START ON THE MEAT FOR THE WINTER. Robert: HOME SWEET HOME. [ BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY ] WHEW! WELCOME BACK. LOOKS LIKE YOUR PACK'S A LITTLE HEAVIER THAN WHEN YOU LEFT. YES, IT IS. HOW'D YOU DO? I SHOT A BUCK. WELL, GREAT. CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT? I FEEL OKAY. GOOD. NO, I FEEL LIKE I GET... ALL THIS STUFF A LITTLE MORE. GOOD, GOOD. GOOD JOB. WE'LL EAT SOME **** DEER TONIGHT, HUH? YEAH, NO, I'M - I'M ACTUALLY EXCITED. YEAH, GOOD. WANT ME TO TAKE THAT GUN AND PUT IT UP? [ Voice breaking ] YEAH. WHAT? I'M NOT BEING A WIMP. I'M NOT BEING A WIMP. NO, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT. [ CHUCKLES ] I NOW UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO TAKE AN ANIMAL'S LIFE, AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BRING IT HOME AND BE CONNECTED TO WHAT YOU GATHERED. IT'S CHANGED ME. IT'S CHANGED MY PRIORITIES AND HOW I WANT TO LIVE MY LIFE. GREAT. GOOD GOING. Troy: [ SIGHS ] FOR ALL THE **** WE HAD TO DO, IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD DAY, MAN. YEAH. CUSACK IS THE MAN. EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT LEARNING ABOUT HUNTING, HE'S STILL JUST FUN TO BE AROUND OUT THERE. BUT YOU DO LEARN A TON OF **** [ Imitating Bob C. ] OH, YES, MY BOY. YEAH. WHAT'S UP, DAD? IT WAS A BAD DAY. [ CLEARS THROAT ] BEAR CHARGED. MY GUN JAMMED. I NEARLY GOT KILLED TODAY. BOB CAME AROUND ME AND KILLED THE BEAR RIGHT AT OUR FEET. HOLY **** JUST GOT BOMBSHELLED WITH THE FACT THAT MY DAD ALMOST DIED TODAY, YOU KNOW? IT SCARED THE **** OUT OF ME. IT MAKES ME NERVOUS ABOUT YOU GUYS BEING OUT HERE, DOING THIS SAME THING. WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING BOB WAS THERE. YEAH, YOU THINK? BUT NORMALLY, HE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN, KYLE. DID YOU GET THE BEAR? YEAH, IT'S IN THE BOAT. YOU GUYS NEED TO TAKE CARE OF IT. OKAY. [ SIGHS ] BUT IT SHOOK ME UP. ANYWAY, I NEED YOU TO LOOK AT THAT, AND GO GET THE BEAR IN THE BOAT. ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. Kyle: YOU ALWAYS THINK OF YOUR DAD AS, YOU KNOW, THE IMMORTAL SUPERHERO, AND SEEING HIM TODAY DEFINITELY MORTALIZED HIM. HE'S ONE OF THE TOUGHEST GUYS I'VE EVER KNOWN, AND TO SEE HIM LIKE THAT... THAT MAKES ME SECOND-GUESS EVEN WANTING TO BE OUT THERE AND DO THIS. THAT'S WHY IT'S ME AND YOU. YOU KNOW, BOB HAD HIS BACK. I GOT YOUR BACK. YOU GOT MY BACK. [ SIGHS ] I SUPPOSE. Troy: WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WITH BOB AND MY DAD, YOU KNOW, JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THAT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT YOU TRUST IN THE WOODS. I NEED KYLE, YOU KNOW, TO BE WITH ME, 'CAUSE WE TRUST EACH OTHER, WE'RE BROTHERS, WE'RE BLOOD. I NEED MY BROTHER IN THE WOODS. LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BEAR, THEN. WENT FROM WALKING THIS MORNING TO ON THE PLATE TONIGHT. THAT'S THE WAY WE ROLL. UP HERE ON KODIAK, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE OFF THE LAND. THIS IS MY WAY OF LIFE. THIS IS WHERE I BELONG. THERE IT IS. Bob C.: THE KILL'S ON THE TABLE. YEAH! Nicole: BEING AN ALASKAN IS WORKING HARD TO FEED YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY... SMELLS AMAZING. [ BREATHES DEEPLY ] ...AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT IT'S A PART OF WHO I AM. I FEEL LIKE I'M REALLY CONNECTED TO ALASKA AND MYSELF AGAIN, ACTUALLY. [ LAUGHS ] CONGRATULATIONS. Nicole: THANKS, DAD. HERE YOU GO. Bob M.: NOTHING REALLY COMES EASY OUT HERE. YOU'VE GOT TO RELY ON YOUR FRIENDS. WHOO-HOO! BUT, HEY, I WOULDN'T HAVE IT ANY OTHER WAY. MMM! WOW.
