 - Previously on Haven... - Chief Wuornos. This is... - Special Agent Audrey Parker. Oh! I'm sorry. Are... are you all right? - Didn't feel it. - She know you're not a... a real boy? - You took my clothes. - I saved your life. - You must be Duke. - Don't need to say it. - This is gonna suck.

 Watch out! I've been a lot of help to you recently, and I was just hoping for a little quid pro quo. - Ooh, that sounds illicit. - I was shooting for civil. What is this, a joke? What about the photographer who took the picture? Where's the Colorado Kid buried? - You are the spitting image of someone I sold flowers to years ago. - Wait. W-w-what was her name? - Lucy! I believe it was Lucy! - The troubles are back, aren't they? - Yeah, I think so.

 - And I'm afraid they won't go away this time. - Good morning. - Hi. - You look, uh... nice. - Wait. What's that supposed to mean? - It means you look nice. - And yet somehow it doesn't sound like a compliment. Are you on duty? - Why? - Well, you're dressed like you're on duty. Don't get me wrong. You... you pull it off beautifully. - And that doesn't rate better than nice? - You have a certain... federal-agent-chic thing going on. Yeah. Hey, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions. - Are these work-related questions? - No, I'm... I'm on my own time. I am looking into a woman named Lucy. - You know, I would love to help, but I think I've made it pretty clear, I don't talk to cops, even cops that I like, which... technically, you would be the only one. So congratulations, but nonetheless, I still don't do it. - That was almost a compliment... heavy on the "almost." - I'll be more careful next time. I do have plans. - Well, can... can you just wait? What? Oh, relax. She's an aesthetician, not an arms dealer. - You know, I could make you talk to me. - Yeah, I suppose you could. Or... you could make life a whole lot easier on yourself and just wait till I'm in a more cooperative mood. - Fine. Later. - Enjoy. Hey, Audrey, you should go check out the Haven farmers' market. Have a snow cone. Let me know how it is. Forgive me. I don't know. - Is this some kind of joke? - What are you talking about, Kat? - This is rotten! - I'm sorry. Is there a problem here? - If you're selling rotten stock to us, the chef is gonna throw a fit. - You're crazy. There's nothing wrong with my apples. - What does this look like? - A candy apple. - Hold on. Hold on. I just dipped those. My apples are fine. My God, what the hell is this? - What's going on here? - No, no, they were fine this morning! - I can't believe this. - Somebody framed us. - Somebody call an ambulance. # # - Okay, thank you. That would help. - Trouble at the farmers' market. You're here. Cause and effect? Funny. - So what happened? - This... used to be sweet corn. - Big deal. I've seen worse in my fridge. - Yeah, can your fridge do this in 30 seconds? - A biological agent? - Yeah, a disease, a weird fungus. - Chemicals, drunk crop duster. - Yeah, I may not have your sensitive nose, but I think I would have smelled that one. - Well, they'll test for everything. I mean, whatever it was had an area effect. - But it hit just a few carts, you know? Why not all of them? - You think they were targeted? - Possibly. But you know what's weird? Is the timing. All of this went bad at the same time. - Okay. Let's go check out these farms. Hamish Stewart? Nathan Wuornos, Haven Police. Sorry to bother you. This is Officer Parker. - Uh, is it all like that? - There's a whole crib in the barn. And that's what I get for going organic. - You don't use chemicals? - My life partner is a vegan... the fool. I guess you can blame Angus for this. - Came back here and found several more bad eggs in the nests... but only in this coop, not in the other ones. - Are they all on organic feed? - That's where the money is, sweetie. - And what's the difference between these two coops? - Well, this one's for the horny hens... Fertilized eggs. Do you think my rooster's sick? - Well, the lab'll test him, I'm sure. - Well, he looks okay... still chasing the hens. Not all of 'em mind getting caught. - So we're asking that any affected farmers give us paperwork on their customers and suppliers. - This is really what you ought to be looking at. - I got the guys digging through the farmers' paperwork. - Well, why so selective? You know, one plot out of a whole orchard, one henhouse, one crib of corn out of a dozen. And why these stands? - Have you thought about calling the bureau? - I wasn't planning on it, but I'd like to have something to tell them first... anything. - Here, you can show them this... prelim tox report. - Hydrochloric acid? - Mm. It's not a biological agent. - It's not a weaponized one. That's a stomach acid. That doesn't get on tops of trees and in eggs unless somebody puts it there. - Mm. Wuornos. Eleanor, what happened? - The entire high school sailing team... GI distress, nausea, cramping. - Any idea what caused it? - Postrace treats? - Ah, hell. Benjy? - Who's Benjy? - Ice cream, homemade in Haven. Been going since I was a kid. And how do you not love meeting the cow who made your ice cream possible? - Wait. Now, back up. The cows live at the store? Isn't that a zoning problem, at a minimum? - It's more like you put the store where the cows live. It's never been a problem. Been there for 40 years. - All right, so what's the common thread... farms, animals? - Let's find out. He likes his naps. - Hey, little Nate. - Benjy. - Your knocking woke me up. - Benjy, did you have any problems at the store today? - Not that I'm aware. But you know me... I could sleep through a rodeo. - Do you mind if we take a look in the freezer? - Of course not. But, uh, what's going on? - Well, something happened over at Haven Academy. Some kids got sick. - On my bars? - Well, we don't know exactly what... - Yeah. Now we do. - What happened? - Are your cows here? - Out back. Oh! Girls! Oh! Oh, Janis! - No, don't touch! Oh, no. Oh, God, no. - What's this stuff? - You want to be a local? Helps to look like one. Thanks, Nathan. That's... that's really sweet. But I thought I just had to squint a lot and leave out half my words. - That'd be a start. - All right, so I'm still trying to figure out what these incidents have in common. Do you have the vendor report? - Yeah, right here. - And? - There's a common thread, but I can't believe the McShaws have anything to do with this. - Wait. The Mc-whos? - Bill and Geoff McShaw. They're brothers that run the Second Chance Bistro. All these vendors supply them. - So you think that somebody's trying to hurt them through their suppliers? That's a reach. - Yeah, it's a big one. - There was a woman yelling at an apple vendor at the market... something about a chef getting mad. - Oh, that sounds like Geoff. He's pretty good at getting mad. Let's go talk to him. - Go... - Black Bears! - Yeah, this local thing is gonna take a while. - The place has been in their family for ages. Bill stuck around and took over after their folks died. Nice guy. - And Geoff? - Talented and knows it. Studied cooking all over the world and just got back in town. They're reopening with a menu featuring only local ingredients. - You can cook pine trees? - Hey, Bill. - Hiya, Nathan. - This is Officer Parker, my new partner. - I thought Geoff was just being dramatic. - Dramatic about what? - A lot of food's gone bad recently. He made a beautiful corn and apple fritter to go with the entree tonight, and look what happened. - Corn and apples? Did... did he use eggs in there? - Yeah, sure. I thought we were just getting a run of bad stock. - Can we talk to Geoff? - Yeah, he's... inside. - Any idea why someone would be out to hurt your business? - Jealousy. Isaac, your knife skills are better than that. Check the stove. He belongs in a cafeteria. Ah, everyone, check this out. This is a proper dice. No sesame seeds, all right? What, are you trying to make me sick? Lt, uh, muddies the flavor. I'm counting on you to get this right. - Let's talk about your enemies. - I have fans, not enemies. - The Times says, "Geoffrey McShaw "is evocative and challenging, a chef of the future." - I rest my case. - Well, could there be competitors out to disrupt you? - Competition... no one this side of Portland is doing what I'm doing. - This guy's been, uh, coming by. Keeps looking over the building... John Robert. - What exactly is a lobster pup? - It's kind of like a hot dog with... Iobster. It's not my thing. But it's working for him. He's got 20 locations. - Yeah, it's possible. Look, is there anyone closer to you that we could look at? - We did fire a few people a couple months ago. - Ah, this is something new. Seared squab with tarragon. - Squab? Is that pigeon? - Free-range organic pigeon. We raise them on the roof. - Yo-ho, boys, delivery. Well, well, well. Look who's here. How was the farmers' market? - Not so great, thanks to you. How was your afternoon? - Entertaining. - Really? - You're looking lovely. You're looking very... Nathan-y. - Yeah. - What do you got? Wow. Wow. Really? Still? The pigeon? - You're gonna like this, all right? Just... just... just you wait. - No, no, no, I'm sure that I would, if I actually put it in mouth, which, um, isn't gonna happen. - So... what have you got for me today? - $500 to find out. - What, dollars? For that crate? - Meg, just in time. - For what? - Uh, mystery crate day. - Sometimes it's uni from the Sea of Japan or yellowtail cheeks from Ecuador. - Either way, he has to pay first. That's the game. - Nothing black market, of course. - No. Of course not, Nathan. - $500 is on the steep side. - I don't think we can do this right now. With the reopening costs, it's... - We... we have to. Bill, tell your wife... in for a penny, in for a pound. This is what makes us better than everyone else. - Now, money is one thing. But getting on the wrong side of Meg is on top of my "don't" list. This one's on me. - I'll take "free" for an answer. - I can't do that, Duke. - All right, I-I know that it's been probably 20 years, but I can still kick your butt. Take your check back. - Everything we've seen ties in to this place. - You think someone's after Geoff? - He says he has no enemies, but still, an angry sister-in-law, a jealous brother. - A wannabe fast-food tycoon sizing up his storefront. - Yeah, but still, why attack through four different suppliers and with acid? That just... it doesn't make sense. What was that? - Get in. Raining birds? Oh, you got to be kidding me. I've seen this movie. It doesn't end well. - The poor guys. - You were raising them to cook them. - Yeah, but this? This is wrong. - Are you sure that nobody comes to mind that might have a problem with Geoff or the restaurant? - The biggest problem with Geoff is Meg. I don't think she'd do this, but... - But... - There's definitely tension between them. Geoff basically came back to bail Bill out, okay? Geoff could be in New York or London. He should be. But Bill needed help. I don't think Meg liked him needing it. Look, I got to go back, okay? - Go ahead. Resentment's a motive. - Yeah. Ugh, I can smell the acid in this thing. You think Meg would do this? - Someone did. - This is amazing. - I grow most of the herbs we use at the restaurant, some produce too. - It's perfect. - It's my refuge. Bill can be around Geoff all day at the restaurant, but I'm not his brother. - You don't like your brother-in-law? - I hate how he treats my husband. I'd walk away from Geoff and this place in a heartbeat if I could. - But Bill won't go? - Three generations of McShaws have owned that place. Bill's held it together all by himself for years. - So... why did he ask Geoff to come back? - Their parents made them promise to keep the business. Bill is nothing if not faithful to his word. But Geoff's the restaurant genius, not Bill. You see that? That's Bill's gift. You give Bill a piece of wood, and he'll make something wonderful. - So Bill puts Geoff first. - Geoff puts Geoff first. He doesn't appreciate Bill or how much Bill gave up to keep their promise, and he never will. - Sounds like you resent him. - His overspending, his quest for the perfect dish... he's put us in a spot that, if this reopening doesn't work, we'll lose everything. I guess you could say I resent him. - What happened to your tarragon? - I'm not sure. When I came out today, it was like that. - Mr. Robert, you still supervise deliveries? - Time is money, Detective. You don't grow to 17 locations by watching every penny. Labor costs more than food. - Lobster's cheap? - Lobster pup is a processed seafood product. Seasoned right, tastes the same... no lobster necessary. Here's a coupon... free side with any regular order. I recommend the hush puppies. - I'll pass. Want to tell me why you're interested in the Second Chance? Doesn't seem like your kind of place. - Location's more important than costs. - Is that so? - I want a mother ship for the Lobster Pup chain, and they've got the best views in Haven. - Is that why you sabotaged their business? - No need to. The way Geoff mismanages product costs, he's doing it himself. Let's just say I'm on his speed dial. - Margie, you here? We're here for your ad copy. - Oh. - Hi. - Hi, Margie's upstairs getting her phone. - Sure. - Anytime. - Oh, do I have a... Is there a zipper undone? - No, no, it's not that. - Uh, it's just that you look, uh... Nice. - Nice? Yeah, I've been getting a lot of that lately. I'm trying to find something to wear to this restaurant opening tonight. - Uh, yes, of course. The McShaw boys are having trouble again, aren't they? - Uh, always figured Duke would get them in hot water sooner or later. - I don't think he has anything to do with their problems. Will you guys look at me? Okay, what's wrong? Is it too professional? - No. - No. - Not professional. But it is too, uh... sunny? - Yeah, exactly. Uh, a bit sunny. - I-I don't do sunny. Okay. - I-I don't do sunny. Okay. Can you just... can you hold on, just right there? I'll try a... great. - Ah. Oh! Uh... It's a little... branchy. - Leafy-branchy. - Okay, no. - It's a little girly. - Thin straps. - Okay, all right. I-I'm gonna try just a couple... couple more. - It's too rococo. - It's an old lady's color. - It's de rigueur. - Oh... - Uh! - Oh! It's purple. - Mauve. - I hate purple. Try this. - Really? I don't think... I can't believe you guys are giving me fashion advice. - She should have come to us sooner. - A lot sooner. You're staring again. - But in a good way this time. That sounded creepy, even to me. - It's perfect. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. - She's lucky we came in when we did. - She sure is. But she did look splendid, though. - Yeah, and you look 100 years old, so forget about it. # # - Thank you. - Well, I was watching the kitchen. I didn't see anything suspicious. John Robert hasn't done anything but have too many drinks. - All right, I have a theory. - Surprise. - You're not gonna like it. - Surprise again. - Geoff cooks fritters, all the ingredients he uses go bad at the market. He cooks squab, pigeons fall from the sky. I was in Meg's garden today, and all the tarragon... dead, the same tarragon that he used to cook the squab. - Parker... - Everything Geoff cooks dies... - Parker... - The flocks, the orchards. - And the Benjy bars. - No idea... except for that I'm out of good answers. - So we should embrace bad ones? - No. - Officer Parker. Nathan. Careful, now. It's the quiet ones you have to watch out for. - Contribute any contraband to tonight's menu? - Well, we'll have to see what Geoff made. - Am I interrupting something? Excuse me, Audrey. Well, it's all yours now, lads. It's about time. - It's hard not to still see our folks' place, you know? - Not unless you deep-fry the pigeon. - Which might not be such a bad start. - Excuse me. Can I have your attention, please? Our first course, a dandelion-green salad with crisp basil, fresh from our garden. Enjoy. - I'm gonna go test my theory. I'll be right back. Just don't... don't eat anything. - Here's that list of old employees. - Thanks. I'm surprised you invited him here. You know, he's interested in the place. - Ah, he asked my brother to sell his half. Geoff said neither of us would do that. - I hate to say it, Bill, but you might want to double-check that. - So my theory was brilliant but completely wrong. He cooked with the basil, but the garden's fine. - Shocker. - Did you tell John Robert that you would consider? - Lower your voice, please. It's not the time or the place. - I think it's exactly the time. - It's not the time or the place. Do what you do best... meet and greet. - What is that about? - I think Bill just found out that Geoff's on John Robert's speed dial. - Attention, please. A toast. It takes patience and effort to make a dream come true. But once it does... you always seem to have another one. To a dream come true. - Hear! Hear! - Enjoy the salmon. - Look down. So much for preventing the next attack. - Don't worry. It'll be fine, Geoff. - Fine? It's not going to be fine. It's a disaster! - "It all works out, Kitty-Kat." Isn't that what you always say? - Damn it! - That's enough, Geoff. I put everything I have on the line for you, help you push this high-end concept you want so badly, and you serve garbage! You want so badly, and you serve garbage! - I've got much more to lose than you. Do you know the risk that I took with my reputation to even come here and help you? - Help me? Or sell me out to John Robert? - Yeah, I was an idiot to come here and help you. And if you don't appreciate what I'm trying to do, then... I-I'm happy to leave. - Good. - Where you gonna go? - I have a standing offer to chef at Red Fish Blue. - With Justine? But you said you'd never go back to her. - To work for her, not to be with her. - Well, then take me with you. - Katarina, you're the best sous around, all right, but you wouldn't last a day in New York. - Runnin' out again? No more second chances? - I'm all out of them. Take the knife. - No, don't. Don't go, Geoff. Stay. - I can't keep bailing you out. You're on your own this time. - Come on. - Well, it wasn't Geoff's cooking. - I was watching the food the whole time. I don't get it. - Yeah. Neither do I. - Thought you'd want to see this. - What happened? Geoff. What the hell? - Do you really think that I would hurt Geoff? - No, I don't. We need to know what you saw. - He showed up here late. He was upset about what happened at the dinner. - Did he blame anybody? - Geoff, he blamed everybody. - Anyone in particular? - No. I know that he seemed like a monster, but he wasn't. Outside of the kitchen, he was a good guy. - Why'd he come to see you last night? - Because he was upset, Nathan. He needed somebody to talk to. He told me about the fight he had with his brother. He felt trapped. - So what was all this business with the knife? - When I was a kid, I had a pellet gun. We shot a duck. Later, when Geoff tried to cook it, it escaped and came flapping at us. Scared the crap out of us. Bill tried to put it out of its misery with a pocket knife. Geoff stopped him. Said, "Maybe it deserves a second chance." Geoff used the pocket knife to make us peanut butter and jelly sandwiches instead. Ever since then, we've been giving each other second chances. Hence, the name of the restaurant. It was meant to be a second chance for them. - So you talked. And... - I told him that I would help him in any way I could. He said he didn't feel well. And he left. I heard a noise on the dock. I didn't... think anything of it. I thought he tripped, all right? - I think I'm gonna go talk to Meg and Bill again. - I'm gonna go find John Robert. - Why John Robert? - He was the last call made on Geoff's cell. - You know, Geoff hated the water. He did. He got sick every time we took him out. In fact, I think he cooked fish as a revenge on the ocean. And then he died in it. It's a shame. Any other circumstance, I would have appreciated the irony. It's one hell of a grand opening, huh? - They'll never forget it, that's for sure. - By the way, you looked nice in that dress last night. - There it is again, "nice." - I meant nice. - Thank you. - It's just nice to see another side of Officer-Agent Parker. - I am pretty sure you saw every single side of me the day we met when you fished me out of the water. - It's a shame you're a cop. - And why is that? - I don't usually socialize with cops. - Did it ever occur to you that that might be their choice? - No. - Hey, I know it's not gonna fix anything, but I'm gonna figure out what happened to your friend. - I know you will... Officer-Agent Parker. - You think I killed him? - He called you, and then he died. You wanted to buy him out. - I-I don't want that building anymore, okay? He... he destroyed the energy of the place. - You told that to Geoff? - From my hospital bed, after I had my stomach pumped. I-I withdrew my offer. Oh, God, I will never eat fish again. - Except for lobster pups. - Why would I eat those? - Bill's gone to set up for the wake. It's too soon, but it's the McShaw way. - They seemed pretty angry with each other last night. - I didn't kill him. Neither did Bill. We were together all night. Do you know why I'm staining this piece instead of Bill? Because the restaurant never leaves him any time for himself. I've been hoping, somehow, he'd find a way to get free, and when we go under, I guess he will be. Oh, sorry. That's Bill's favorite stress food. He was working here yesterday. - Does he have more of these? - In there. Oh, what is that? - The missing piece. Where are these lobsters from? - Hidden Cove. I'm making some lobster salad for the wake. Geoff never liked my recipe, thought it was pedestrian. - Take a bite of it. Please. - What's this supposed to prove? - Just... just take one more bite, and I'm gone. You killed your brother. You hated him. - What? No. - You killed him. Just admit it! - No, I didn't. - No, just admit it. - Agent Parker... - No, I didn't! - You hated being stuck here. - Are you kidding me? - So you killed him! - He was my brother, and I wouldn't hurt him! - When you get upset, what you eat turns out like that. You ate the same salmon Geoff did. - Oh, God, Geoff... died 'cause of me. - Geoff's autopsy results are in. There was no salmon in his stomach, just some kind of pastry. - You mean I didn't kill him? - They're ruling it an accident. He fell into the water and drowned. He was in anaphylactic shock, some massive allergic reaction to sesame oil. - But Geoff... never ate anything without knowing what was in it. - Maybe it wasn't an accident. How you holding up, Katarina? - I feel lost without him. - Yeah, I'm sure you do. You two were close, weren't you? - Yeah. I thought we were going places together. - Instead you're gonna be going to prison alone. That's kind of sad. - What? I don't understand. - Sure, you do. You knew that Geoff was allergic to sesame oil. So you drizzled some on a pastry, and the pecans hid the flavor. - No, I... - So what? He came over. You talked him into tasting some. - You can't prove any of this. - She doesn't have to if you confess. - You know what the funny thing is? Is that we thought Bill killed Geoff for a while. But then we realized it had to be you. - You grew up here, Katarina. So did I. You've heard stories about the troubles. Those are just stories. - Are they? - You know why the food kept going bad? It was Bill. He was so angry about things here, when he ate, it poisoned the food. - You people are crazy. - You think so? Then you won't mind if Bill finishes the sandwich you were eating. - Don't worry about it. He hasn't killed anybody yet. - Except some pigeons. - And the cows, but, I mean, that was an accident. - Makes you wonder what would happen if he was trying. - Stop, okay? Just stop it! He wasn't supposed to die. After everything I did for him, he was just gonna leave me here and go back to Justine. - You knew he was allergic. - Yes, but I just wanted to make him sick. I thought, with all the ill people, no one would notice. I never meant to kill him. I just wanted to make him feel as bad as I did. I'm sorry. No one should be able to do things like that. - They can't. That's the thing about growing up around here. People actually believe those tales. The troubles are just stories to scare kids around the campfire. - Are you okay? - Can't have her thinking Haven's full of freaks, can we? - Are those Geoff's personal effects? - Bill should have them now that we're done. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he should. - I cannot believe he was going to stay. - Yeah, he went back for the knife. I guess he wasn't done giving second chances. - Hey. - You really think this'll work? - Yeah. I think it might. - I'm sorry about Geoff. - Thanks for coming. - What's up, bro? - Same deal. This time, I set the price. - All right, I'll buy. How much? - 20. - That's it? - The Second Chance? - I don't want to run it without Geoff. Brings me nothing but anger. And, like I talked about with Agent Parker, stress doesn't agree with my digestion. - I can't take your restaurant, Bill. - Ah, go on, Duke. That's as close to keeping it in the family as I can get. You're the only second chancer left. - I don't know what to say. I... - Hey, you know the rules. There's no refunds. Besides, you could use a legitimate business. - When you put it that way. - You really think I can make a living at this woodworking? - Honestly, I don't care. I'm just glad to have my husband back. - So what do you think? - It's a start. Oh, that's high praise from a Wuornos. - Saw your car parked on the street. - Yeah? - Yeah. - And? - You took up three spaces. - So? - It's gonna take time. - Yeah. Yeah, it is. You know, I was thinking about how there are two different Havens. There's the one that's right beneath the surface, and then there's the one right underneath that. - Sounds like every town. - It's definitely not like every town. But you, Nathan, you live in both Havens, and I think that we're gonna find that very useful. - Might be. - This is one of those times where you need to say absolutely nothing. - Okay.
