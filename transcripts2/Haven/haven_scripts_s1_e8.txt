 - Previously on Haven... - You really think this Jess Minion is a witch? - What do you think the troubles are? Magic is everywhere here. - Whatever she is, she is interesting. - So you seriously can't feel pain? - It's called idiopathic neuropathy. - Jess, I think Detective Wuornos needs to come by and conduct a safety review of your home. I'd say around 8:00? - Great. Maybe you can bring a nice bottle.

 - Of wine? - Does she know you're not a... a real boy? - I'm gonna do what I can to help you find out about your mum. - You would do that? - Well, we gotta stick together up here. - The troubles are back, aren't they? - Yeah, I think so. - And I'm afraid they won't go away this time. - Nonfat almond mocha latte with a dusting of cinnamon, I think. - Black, I think. - Nope, I decided to try yours. - How do you like it?

 - Still working up the nerve to try it. - You know you could have come inside. - You were sleeping. - You could have been sleeping too. - But then who would have got us the coffees? Right? - Oh, you're an odd man, Detective Wuornos. - That's what they keep telling me. - I have a few people to visit today. Would you like to come by tonight? - Yeah. I'd like that. - Tell Audrey I say hello. - Hi. - Hey, thanks for picking me up this morning. My car just wasn't feeling up for it or something. Thanks. Mmm. What is this? - Dessert, I think. - Ah, Jess's influence, I take it. - She has a sweet tooth. - All right, so you went out with her last night, but you're bringing her coffee in the morning? That means that you didn't spend the night, and no sane man leaves that woman's bed unless the world is on fire. - If I hadn't picked you up, who would you have called? - I don't know, a bureau car, a cab. - Any friends you can call? Here? I've been here, what, five minutes. - It's been a lot longer than that. - Okay, you know what, if you don't want to talk about Jess, just say so. - Would that work? - Probably not. - Probably not. Who would you have called in Boston? - A bureau car, a cab. I have friends! - Mm-hmm. What's that cop's name? - Steve. - Stan. How 'bout her? - Okay, I get it. You know, I get it. Good morning, Stu. - Morning, Audrey. - Morning, Stan. - Hey, Nathan. - Crap. All right, so who's our friend here? - Bill Rand. Stabbed through the heart after he came out of that bar at closing time. - Weapon? - Honestly not sure. A long knife, sword, spear. Whatever it was, it went right through him. And whoever used it took it with 'em. - Looks like Mr. Rand was stabbed through his I.D. first and then his heart. - Not easy to do. - Well, not unless you're trying to make a point. Hey... hey, the Hessberg Medical Center. Doesn't Jess work there? - Yeah, Jess works there sometimes. So what do you think, angry patient? coworker? - Yeah, it makes sense. Let's start there. Thanks, Steve. - Uh... you're welcome. - Hmm. # # - I have friends. - I shouldn't have said anything. It's just this whole thing with Jess, it's making me do things I wouldn't normally do. - But, you know, she's worth it. - Yeah. Yeah, she is. So... do you have friends? - I... I mean, I guess I just, I never had time for them. I worked two jobs in college, and then went to Quantico, and then the bureau. - You should try small talk. - Nathan Wuornos promoting small talk? That's like Superman trying to sell kryptonite. - I'm not the one looking for friends. - Hey, I didn't say that I was looking for friends. - Right this way, please. - Watch this. I like your hair. - Um, right this way. - All right, I need practice. - Tons. - Can you think of anybody that may have wanted to harm Mr. Rand? - No, I really don't. Bill was a nurse here forever. The patients really liked him, and so did the doctors. - Were there any incidents here at the medical center that were related to Mr. Rand? - Not that I can think of. - When we talk to his coworkers and patients, we're not gonna hear about anything? - The dark man. - Excuse me? - We deal with a lot of sad stories here... people fighting for their lives, taking terrible drugs, often just to have a few more months. There's no explanation as to why one person dies and another one lives. Some families make up stories to make some sort of sense of it all. - Families believe a dark man is responsible for patient deaths? - It's not unusual at all. - Well, until we can meet the dark man, I'd like to focus on someone we can see. - And so he took this terrible situation and, like he always did, he made it a funny story. I think maybe that's what I miss most about Rubin. - Hey, we should go in. - No, I can see Jess some other time. - No, actually I thought it would be good to go in and see if these people can tell us more about the place. - Oh, of course. Yeah, absolutely. - That and his laugh and his singing. And his... well, I guess you get the idea. Thanks for listening. - Thornton, is there anything you'd like to share about Sarabeth? - Um... I know that we're supposed to be remembering our loved ones today, but I have to... to remember something else. I was a miserable and angry husband, and I treated my Sarabeth like garbage. Now I'm not that person anymore. And when she died, that person went with her. I just wish that... just wish she could have been married to the man I am now. - That was really powerful stuff. - All those people lost someone recently. Hello. - Hi. - Jess, did you know Bill Rand? - Nurse Rand? Why? - He was killed this morning. - Oh, my God. - Are you Jess's policeman? - Uh, guess I am. - We want you to know that the dark man is real. - What exactly is the dark man? - We don't know. We just know he's a killer and that he took our families from us. - Maybe we should let the officers go. - No, no, it's okay. Have any of you seen the dark man kill anyone? - No, but we've seen him lurking around here. We've all had family members die before their time because of him. - We realize how crazy it sounds. - Well, it would sound better with evidence. - Here, why don't we take your contact information, and if anything turns up, we'll let you know. - Okay. - Unsurprisingly, there's nothing about dark man in here. - No one seems connected to Rand. - Or filed a complaint against him. - Hey, thank you, Allan. - Hey, Audrey. - Allan. He'd give me a ride if I wanted him to. - That's nice. Except his name is Bob. - Anyway, I would say that we have nothing, but I think we have less than nothing. - Actually, you have dinner. - Awesome. Nathan, would you please marry this woman? Sorry. Did I just make that awkward? - Well, we have to get to second base first. Sorry, I made that even more awkward. - Moo shu, kung pao, peking duck, the classics. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Apparently it's what I have to do if I want to see you at night. - In that case, I will keep him late every night. - Whoa. - Oops. - That's all right. - Well, how's it going today? - Um, murder, secrets, the usual. - Sounds sad. - Actually, the saddest thing was those families today at the Hessberg Center. Seemed like most of them weren't able to accept the death of their family members yet. - I've been trying to talk them out of the dark man idea for weeks. - We don't exactly know what's going on at the center, so maybe you should just take a few days off until we do. - Isn't he cute when he wants to take charge? - He is cute. You should see him around babies. Okay. Well, time to let you get back to work. Maybe I'll see you later? - I will try. - Bye. - You sure you're up for planning a trip? - No, but I need to think about something other than Bill for a while. - You know, these tours are pretty expensive. - We have the money. Where to begin. - I'm going to order dinner. - Maybe France. Omelette du fromage, s'il vous pla?t. Oh, caf? au lait. Merci. Bien s?r. Ooh la la. Mais, oui. - Found the hole. - So the knife went through her and punctured the couch? - No, the M.E. said that she was stabbed from behind, so it had to go through the couch first. - A knife that long would never fit back there. - No, it wouldn't, but it did. At this point, the dark man's starting to make a lot more sense to me. - Stabbing's emotional. Somebody was really pissed off. - Hey, can you make sure to get a picture of the back of the couch? - Sure. - Thanks, Tony. Steve? - Eddie. - Ed... damn. That wasn't even an option. Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, great. Thanks for coming in, Mrs. Halter. - Menchie. - Menchie. Can you tell us about the dark man? - Finally. Of course I can. He's tall and thin. - He's short and wide. - 6'5". - Are you sure? - Absolutely, positive. And dark. Really dark. - I heard he carried a sword. That's what I heard. - But obviously you've... you've never seen him. - I'm a good listener. - No, no, not a sword. Maybe... maybe more like a bat. - Definitely dark, though. - Everyone says dark. - Yes, dark. - Look, our family members died too soon. It had to have been the dark man. Who else could it be? - Thank you, Menchie. Thank you, Thornton. Thank you, Bart. Thank you all for coming. Thank you. - Okay, well, let's get to work looking for a tall, short, thin, wide dark man, who may or may not be carrying a sword. - Yes, you make pretty pictures. But I don't want pretty. I want real. I want grungy. I want it to hurt. - Yes, you're a pain, all right. - Mock away. But photography is truth. It reveals things. It's how I roll. - Oh, please. - The only thing your pictures reveal is your tortured soul. - At least I have a soul. - Yeah. - Ah. - Just the person I was hoping for. - Hello. - We need you to settle an argument. - Well, normally I would love to, seriously, but actually I was wondering if I could check your archives. - Ah. Work before pleasure, of course. - You know, I actually used a computer a couple times in school. Do you care if I give it a shot? - Well, of course you have. I'm sorry. - Okay. - You know what she's gonna pull up. - This'll be embarrassing. - So embarrassing. - It was a different time. - Maine was very short on black people back then. - Haven had none, to its detriment. - Does, uh... "Dark man" ring any bells to you guys, maybe something you didn't write about? - Sorry, no. - Me neither. - All right, well, it was worth a try. Let's do some real police work. - Two stabbings in one week, and they both worked at the medical center. - I know, I looked into the cancer patients. 27 deaths at the center in the last three months. And 12 of these obituaries say they died before their time. - But if patients are being killed for some reason, maybe someone wants revenge. - Exactly. - Wait, is that what you were actually thinking, or did you just steal my idea? - Does it matter? All right, so Wilson and Rand were stabbed, right? Do we know that all the patients at the clinic died of cancer? Do we know that for sure? - They don't do autopsies on cancer patients. - No, they don't, but it's not too late. - You want to exhume them? - I mean, I don't want to. - We don't have enough for a judge's order. - No, we don't. - Except Beverly Jane Mclntyre is Judge Mclntyre's niece. My theory might convince her. You know, this is gonna make us very unpopular with some of the families. - Yeah, but maybe when we find out what's going on, they'll forgive us. I mean, I hope so. Hey, I thought you were meeting with Jess tonight. - Yeah, I was until you talked me into a pile of paperwork. - No, I can do this. I think we've established that I don't have anybody waiting up for me. - No, it's fine. I can see her tomorrow. - You don't want to go. - It's not that. - Know what, you've been weird about this Jess thing from the start. You have a beautiful woman waiting up for you. You have a partner who's willing to do the boring paperwork, and you still don't want to go? Nathan, I wasn't gonna say anything before, but it's not like you have people calling you at all hours of the day to hang out. Tell me. - Tell me. Come on, what's going on? - I don't know if I can make it happen. - Make what happen? Oh. Wait, this isn't your first time, is it? - No. - This is your first time? Well, what... - It is my first time since I've... been like this. I can't even feel my own damn skin. I can't feel her skin. I don't know what else I can't do. I don't... - Well, you should just tell her. - Why? What is she gonna say? - I don't... I don't think she's gonna say anything. Listen, I'll... I'll do this paperwork. You just go figure it out. - No, I should... - You know what? You're welcome. - You seemed so nice. - I am nice. - How is exhuming our families nice? - How did you know about that? I just faxed that paperwork an hour ago. - A friend of mine works in that office. - I'm sorry. I... I really had no other choice. - You absolutely had a choice. - If the dark man killed your wife or anybody else, we need to know how they died. I'm sorry, but this is the only way. - If that's what it takes. But you shouldn't have gone behind our backs. - I still don't like it. - Let's go, Thornton. Let's let the lady do her job. - I'm not saying you need wine, but... I'm saying it wouldn't be a bad idea. - It's that obvious, huh? - I know this isn't your first date. - It feels like it. # # - It is my first date since I, um... Since I stopped feeling anything. - Oh. Nathan, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize what you were going through. I understand. Completely. - Well... okay, that makes one of us. My stomach feels like, uh... when my dad caught me with a girl in high school. - What was her name? - I believe it was Nicole he caught me with, first time anyway. - Nicole? - She was a good kisser. - Can you feel that? # # - No. - Let me try again. Nothing to lose. Everything to gain. Look at me this time. # # Don't stop looking at me. Now can you feel me? - Told you she would still be here. - Oh, God, I hate it when you're right. You should be in a bar somewhere with your friends. - Or so I've been told. What's going on? - Well, my brother and I have a long-running argument about painting and photography. - Did you come all the way down here to have me settle this for you? - No. - Sort of. - I'd like to take your picture. And Vince would like to paint you. - And you choose your favorite, and Dave will learn to live with it. Eventually. - Is that gonna get you guys to leave me alone? - Honestly? Probably not. But I can paint from the photo. It'll only take a minute. - Okay, fine. Let's... let's do it. I mean, what else do I have to do? - Just stand there and be Audrey. - Is this good? - Maybe without the weird smile. - Unbelievable. Jeez. - Beauty. Ah, nice. That's what they saw, it's a shadow. That's the dark man. Hey, watch out. - Oh. - Is that shadow moving on its own? - Yeah, it is. And I'm pretty sure that it already killed two people. - Whoa. - Turn out the lights. You can't have a shadow without any light, right? - Well, how do you know that's the way this shadow works? - I don't know. I'm just making it up, okay? Just do it. - All right. - Look. It does need the light. It can't move without it. - It's too dark for it to come over here, right? - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. - I still don't know how you can know that. - It's in my supernatural shadow guide. It says, hold on, yep. We're screwed. - You ready to try this? Oh, never mind. You're ready. Don't get it. - I need to see who it is. - Why? It's Audrey. It's always Audrey. You'll answer it, and after that you'll be gone. Fine, answer it. - Promise me we'll pick this up again tomorrow. - Promise. - Parker? - Nathan? - Parker? - Yeah. - Nathan, it's right over there. - Yeah. - What the hell is that? I think it's gone. - Okay then. Now we know what the dark man is. - Yes, we do. - Yeah, and why everybody described him differently. - Shadows change shape depending on the light. But why'd he come after you? - Beats me. Do you think it's what killed Wilson and Rand? - Maybe. - Dave, I need you to download those images. There might be a picture of the shadow on there. - He can't download them. - Oh, well, Nathan can just show... - No, I know how to download. I shoot on film. Warmer tones. - It's how he rolls. - Okay, all right. That's great, good. So when can you get us the images? - Target opens at 9:00, I think. - Okay, all right. - Thanks. - Yeah. - Listen, I'm sorry if I, you know, interrupted anything with Jess. - No, no, no, you had a good reason. - Yeah, it was a pretty good reason. So did, uh, anything happen with Jess? - It was about to. - I'm sorry again. Sorry. - "Some shall be pardoned and some punished. "For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo." - That was it. Sarabeth's favorite, I don't know why. - Too sad for you? - No, no, it was too long. It's nice hearing it again. Thank you. - How are you doing, Thornton? - Hanging in there. Some days are better than others but... - Of course. And how did you manage to take care of Sarabeth at the end? - Well, she went so quickly, I didn't have to do much. See, the doctor gave her a year or more. We planned to do all these things. And... and then in a month, she was gone. - Menchie's son died quickly too? - Yeah. - Do you guys talk about it? - You kidding? It's all we talk about. - Mind if I help myself to a glass of water? - Oh, no, go ahead. - Do you want some? - No, I'm fine. Thank you. - Got you your favorite, Nathan. Extra whipped cream and double caramel. All right, so what do those reports say? - That these people all died of the same thing. Cancer. - So not the shadow then. - Well, there is something missing from the tox screen, though. - What? - Adriamycin, bleomycin, herceptin. - Chemotherapy drugs. - The levels are either too low or nonexistent. - They weren't being treated? - Well, maybe with chamomile tea, but not with conventional chemotherapy. - So then they would have died before their time. - Well, not surprising. Untreated cancers can kill you quickly. - Right, but what would be the benefit to not treating them? - Beats me. That's your department, isn't it? - Jess, you okay in there? - You see that? - That looks like a long knife. - It's what killed Rand. - And Wilson. This is the knife that can bend behind a couch. - Yeah, but look what's happening in every photo. - The flashes erase part of the shadow. - What does all this have to do with untreated cancer? - Don't know. - Me neither. - It's not a coincidence, though. - Yeah, not in Haven. All right, what would be the motive to not treat patients? - Let's say money. Maybe Rand withheld chemotherapy. He was a nurse. It would be easy to switch bags. - And Wilson could have sold the drugs to other clinics. Weren't all those travel brochures at Wilson's house, weren't they for spendy places? - Yes, they were. We need to see Wilson's bank records. - Hey, you're kind of smart. - Kind of? - I see you haven't thrown away Sarabeth's medicines yet. - Yeah, I know I'm supposed to. I just like having them around. Makes me, you know, feel like she still lives here. - I understand. But these bottles are full. - Yeah. - If she wasn't taking her medications, how was she tolerating the side effects of chemo? - Well, she never had any side effects. - Really? - Yeah, I guess we just felt lucky that way. - I'm off. I'll see you at the center, right? - Yep. - Bank confirms Wilson had large cash deposits going back several months. - Still doesn't link her to Rand, though. - Same amounts on the same dates in Rand's account. - Oh, well, that does. So Rand and Wilson were stealing chemo from patients? God, there's got to be a special room in hell for that. - And the shadow found out what they were up to and killed them. - But then why would it attack me? - Hi. I'm sort of busy right now. - It's important. - Okay. - I think I know why the center patients were dying prematurely, and I have proof. - What do you mean? - None of the patients were taking their side effects medication. I don't think they were getting their chemo. - Where are you? - Home. Why? - Just stay there. I'm on my way. - But why? I'm fine. - Jess, people close to this have died. Stay right there. - Wait, Nathan. Hey, Nathan, what's going on? Hey! Talk to me. - Damn. - Hello. - Menchie, I think Jess came into our houses for only one reason, and it wasn't therapy. - Hello? Anybody there? - Jess, is that you? - Nathan, I think there's somebody in the house. Jess, okay, please listen to me closely. Find a closet, get in, and close the door. Jess? Jess? Jess? Jess. Jess? - Nathan. - Nathan, she'll be okay. Why don't you just go to the hospital? - I will. I just... I want to figure out what happened first. - Nathan. - My job is to stop this thing before it hurts someone else. Okay, someone knew... someone knew that she had taken these. Maybe that same someone sent the shadow after her. - Sarabeth Arrons. - That's Thornton's wife. - Okay, no, you know what, I'll go talk to Thornton, and I'll just call you at the hospital, and I'll... - You can come along if you want. - No, Nathan, that is a bad idea. - Yeah, maybe, but it's what I'm doing. So you can come or not. - Fine. But I want your gun. - That's the only way this is gonna happen. - Just... - You see that? See his cane? That could be the shadow's sword. - Yeah, or it could just be a cane. Wait. Look at that. - He doesn't have a shadow. - Yeah, but where is it? - Only one way to find out. - Okay, and by that you mean talking to him, right? - Yes. - Because if it is his shadow that's doing this, confronting him in the light would be a really bad idea, right? - Yeah. - What's this about, Officer? - We know about the dark man. - You caught him? - You know who it is. - No, I don't. No one knows. - He could be telling the truth, all right? - You don't know that. - Yeah, but if he is, we need to handle this carefully, okay? So just back me up on this. No, Nathan, back me up on this. - Fine. - It was the center that killed your wife. We think that they were stealing medications that she was supposed to get. - Oh, no. - We have the people responsible for this in custody at the station right now. - I want them held accountable. - That's what we're counting on. Hey, would you like to go to coffee? You would? Great. And then, you know, you can tell me about your brilliant kids, and I can pretend to be interested. And then I'll tell you about my something that I read, but then, you know, pretty soon, I'll just want to freaking kill myself. - You think I believe you didn't know your shadow was the dark man? - How could I know? I can't even wrap my head around what you just told me. You said that it attacked you? - I saw him attack my partner right after you found out she was exhuming your wife. - I was furious at her. It didn't go after any of the patients at the center, though, did it? - We think he was just there looking for your wife's killer. - When they told me that Sarabeth had died, I felt the world crash in on me, and then I felt it lift. The rage and the sadness, it just left me and... and I felt like a new person. Maybe when my shadow left me, it took those feelings with him. - Maybe. - Those other people had it coming, though. - Excuse me? - Those other people who took Sarabeth's time from her. I'm not crying for them. - What about Jess? Hmm? You gonna cry for her? - Why? What happened? Oh, no. Is... is she dead? - She's in the hospital because of you. - No! Not me. Not me! But... I guess it was him, because when I thought that she was stealing Sarabeth's drugs, I got angry, and maybe he felt that, and he went after her. I'm sorry. I can't control him. You should kill me. Kill me and maybe it will... it will kill him too. - Maybe it will. - Oh, my favorite movie. Um... I... I don't think I have a favorite movie. Do you? Seriously? Whew. All right. Okay. Yeah, it's gone. Just make sure it doesn't come back. - So you, uh... you're gonna kill me now? - I can't do that. I promised my partner. - Why are you still here talking to me? - Need to see if your shadow comes back. - And when it does, are you putting me away? - Not just you. Your shadow. Nonfat mocha almond latte with a dusting of cinnamon. - I was gonna call you. - About? What's going on? - I'm going. To Montreal. - That makes sense. A trip will clear your head. I could probably get a few days off work if you want company. Or not. - It's not just a trip. - You're not coming back? - I don't want to go, Nathan. But there are all these things happening here in Haven, the troubles. I can't be here, not after... - I could, um... - These things have a way of finding you. I'm sorry. I wish I was stronger. - Hey, spill it. You didn't say one word on the ride over here, and even for you that's quiet. - Ah, it's nothing. I'm fine. - No, what's wrong? Is Jess okay? - She's fine. She left. - She left? - Not coming back. - Oh, Nathan. I am so... I'm so sorry. - It was bound to happen sometime. - Hey, you know that whole friends thing? You were right, I... I don't think I ever really had any. But I do now. And so do you.
