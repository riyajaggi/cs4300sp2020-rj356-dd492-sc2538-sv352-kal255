 - Previously on Haven... - FBI! Who are you? - Haven PD. Who are you? - FBI. Are you deaf? - Chief Wuornos, this is... - Special Agent Audrey Parker. - Gun trace came in. It belongs to a guy I know: Duke Crocker. - You took my clothes. - I saved your life. - You must be Duke. Oh! I'm sorry. Are you all right? - It's all right. I didn't feel it.

 - You seriously can't feel pain? - No. - Dave Tiggs. My brother, Vince. Publishers of the Haven Herald. - This could be why I thought I recognize you. - She looks like you. - Yeah, I know. You know that vacation time I never take? I need a few weeks. There's just something I need to look into. - She's staying. Maybe she can help you with your troubles. - Good night. Running late again, Otis. I'll be back tomorrow to finish the week's receipts. - Sounds good. - Hannah!

 - Dad. - I thought you said you weren't working here anymore. - Well, I'm not working very much. - This is time you should be spending with Bobby or volunteering, not wasting your time in this pit of a bar. - Hey! Watch your mouth. - Listen, if you want to spend your time selling poison to losers, that's your business. If my daughter wants to waste her time bookkeeping for you, that's mine! - Come on inside. I'll buy you a drink. You liked it straight up, from what I remember, right? - You take care, Otis. Hannah, let's go! - Come on, sweetheart. I'm sorry. - What the hell? # # - Sandwich meatball? What? I wonder when they put that on the menu. Well, good morning to you too, Agent Parker. - I need to know more about her. - I'm fine, thank you very much. Nice of you to ask. I didn't know you were still in town. - That's it? That's all I get? The folksy, local cop brush-off? - I was shooting for civil. - Okay, you know what? You... My bad. Let me take this again. You were the local beat cop in that photo, right? You would've taken a witness statement from that woman. - Maybe. It was a long time ago. - Wouldn't there be an evidence file? - It was a long time ago. - This is a funny town you've got here. - Well I'd say "unique." Now, is there a point coming my way? - I've been a lot of help to you recently... discreet help. And I was just hoping for a little quid pro quo. - Ooh, that sounds illicit. - I was shooting for civil. All right. Okay, you know what? It's gonna take a couple of days. How long are you gonna be in town? - Well, that depends on you. - Okay, well, my advice to you is, just relax. Enjoy yourself. You know what you ought to do is go and visit the Haven moose farm. Not to be missed. Enjoy the vacation. - I don't do vacations. - Then look at it like a learning opportunity. - Dad. - Hey. - You're still in Haven. - Oh, apparently, I'm vacationing. - Actually, I'm looking into the woman in the picture... unsuccessfully. - What can we do for you, Nathan? - There's something strange down at the Rust Bucket. I'm heading out. - Hey, can I tag along? I'm not really big on the moose museum. - It's actually a farm. - Farm, gallery, museum... Can I come? - Well... - I think it's a good idea. Nathan here can use all the help he can get. - After you. - Finally, some peace. - Whoa. All right, so first question is, why is there a giant metal ball? - Oh, everyone knows that ball. - Second question: There's a ball everyone knows about? - Yeah, it's part of a sculpture that's usually up on Green Street. Been there forever. Every year, high school seniors try and steal it, fail, pick something else. - And they fail because... - It's a big bronze ball. - Someone's gonna pay for this! - Excuse me, sir. Agent... uh, Officer Parker, Haven PD... sort of. Did you see anything? - Yeah, a big metal ball crushed my place. - Was there anybody pushing it or a truck that unloaded it? - Just a ball rolling down the hill. - How about is there a person in particular that you may have upset recently? - Ed Driscoll was in my face last night. - Driscoll was here? - Yeah. He's not a big fan of this place since he gave up drinking. - You know him? - Yeah, I know him. I also know his place is up on Green Street. - Where the ball was up until last night. You don't mind, do you? - Mind what? - That I invited myself along. - It's a huge metal ball. Who could resist that? - Exactly. - Well, there's nothing complicated about that ball. Outer shell of bronze, filled with about three tons of sand. - And how long would you say it's been anchored here? - Church bought it in '68, installed in '69. Too heavy to move after. - No rust on these chains. - Oh, I only put them on last year. The new insurance company made us do it. I told them the ball wasn't going anywhere. - Bet you wish you hadn't said that. - All right, let's go find Driscoll. Well, he doesn't look like the kind of guy who'd get in fights with bartenders and then destroy the place. - Just wait until he opens his mouth. - Why, do you know him well? - More than I'd like. - This child belongs to God now. Amen. - He will walk in the path of the Lord with us. It is up to each and every one of us to keep him on that path. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! - The best chance he has of staying on God's path is to live amongst the godly and to steer clear of the troubled and the ungodly. Can I hear an "amen"? Amen. - Haven... is a fine place to raise a family. But you and I know... it is chock-full of the ungodly! Can I hear an "amen"? Amen. - What the hell was that? - I have some history with the rev. - Yeah, well, you think you could have told me that before? - Probably should've. - Yeah. Probably should've. Okay, so what do you know about him? - He's a pompous, self-righteous ass. Never been violent, as far as I know, just angry. Been that way since his wife died. - All right, so do you think you can keep that to yourself while we go talk to the rev? Hello? - You left in a hurry. And you must be Special Agent Parker. - You keeping tabs on me, Reverend? - You're here about the sculpture. - Tell us about the Rust Bucket. - It's a cesspool. Someone in the town did us a favor and destroyed it. - That someone being you? - Agent Parker, has anyone taken the opportunity to welcome you properly to our town? - Answer Nathan's question. - I don't condone violence of any kind. If wanted to destroy that bar, would I use a sculpture from this very church? - Then why were you yelling at the bartender last night? - Hmm. Perfect timing. Hannah! Special Agent Parker, this is my daughter Hannah and her foster son, Bobby. - Hi. - Bobby, I told you, don't bring that bike in the church. - I'm sorry. I forgot. - Hannah, would you mind telling Agent Parker why I was expressing my frustration in the bar last night? - Well, I'd, um... I'd rather not. - My daughter hid from me the fact that she was working there. And I went there to bring her back to do God's work, where her talents can be a better service. - Dad, everyone's waiting for you at the reception. - Duty calls. - Hannah, do you have anything that you may want to tell us about what happened at the Rust Bucket? - No, sorry. I only started working there, and we left hours before it happened. - Bobby, you heard anything? - No, sir. - You mind keeping an ear out for us? - Sure, Nathan. - Agent Parker? My daughter Hannah makes a dynamite seafood stew, every Sunday night, so if you're free, we'd love to be able to welcome you properly to our town. - Thanks, but I have this whole gigantic metal ball thing that I have to look into. And I don't think you're telling us everything about why you were at the Rust Bucket. - Audrey, you're not from here, so I've given you the benefit of the doubt. But let me make something clear: Those are the last questions I'll answer about that place. - Wow, what a sweetheart. So what was that between you and his daughter? - I asked Hannah to the prom without her father's permission. He found out and said she couldn't go. - So the prom is why the rev would barely look at you? - Well, that, and 'cause we ignored him, went up to the ledge, and watched a meteor shower. - And... - And... meteor showers are better naked. - Nathan Wuornos! - Uh-huh. - Just another teenage boy trying to take a girl's clothes off. - No, the meteor shower was my idea. The rest was hers. - Ah. Polyester is so beneath you. - Hello? - Nathan! - Parker? - Nathan! - Parker! Audrey! - What did I do on my vacation? I was cocooned by a blanket. You came and cut me out. No big deal. - Still think you should get checked out. - You know what? I'll... I'll live, okay? And I know you'll think this is ridiculous, but when you think about it, it's got to be the rev that's doing it. He collects butterflies, and I saw a butterfly right before I was cocooned. God, I can't believe I'm saying that. - Me either. - Look, you can deny that strange things are going on around here, but we need to press the rev, and we need to press him hard. - What are you gonna say? "You wrapped me up in a cocoon. Confess." - Yeah, you might have a point. - We need to talk to Hannah without the rev around. I already called the church office. She's at the food bank. Her favorite days are when her father's somewhere else. - They said that? - Well, I might have added that part. - Here you go, Howard. - Thank you. Bobby, I'm gonna take a break, okay? - You know what? A break sounds great. - Hannah, can I talk alone with you for a minute? - Well... - Bobby, let's take a walk. - Okay. - Thanks. - It's really great that Bobby does volunteer work with you like that. - Well, to tell you the truth, he won't leave my side. Getting him to school in the morning is not for the faint of heart, believe me. - So you're his foster mom, right? - Well, my dad took him in a year ago. Thank you. - Yeah. - His family was in a car accident. Bobby was the only survivor. - So your dad took him in, but you're his foster mom? - Dad's good at the big gestures. It's the day-to-day stuff that bores him. - Yeah. You know, taking in a child, that's, uh... that's an amazing, beautiful thing. - Actually, you know what? I didn't think I could do it. What the rev wants, the rev gets. And now I can't imagine life without him. - The rev's not easy. - He's okay. He's the one that brought me home from the hospital when my parents died. And I don't think I came out of my room for a week, and he didn't try to make me. And after a while, I started coming down for breakfast, and he didn't say a word to me, just brought me to school. He's cool that way. - Is he always cool that way? Between me and you, I promise. - He has moods. And when he gets weird, I just go to my room, but... Hannah just takes it. She's just more used to it, I guess. - Your dad has quite a temper, doesn't he? - He doesn't like surprises, that's all. He's just... he's protective. - Is that why he doesn't want you to work? - You know, I know that it's pathetic that I don't stand up to him. I always promise myself I will, and then I never do. If you'll excuse me, I have to finish this. - Agent Parker! How dare you? - Hold on, Rev. - Harass my daughter when she's doing God's work! - You hit your daughter, Rev? - I have nothing to explain to you. - Nathan. - I see it. - What are you doing? Hey! - The last time I saw a butterfly like that, I ended up in a cocoon. - Have you both lost your minds? What's happening? My God! What's happening? Hey! What are you doing? - Go! Go! Go! Go! So you think I'm crazy now? - I never said you were crazy. - This isn't the first weird thing I've seen in Haven, Nathan, and I've only been here a week, so just... can you tell me what's going on? - Every town's got a few skeletons in the closet. - Well, this is a big freaking closet. All right, can we at least agree that whatever's going on here, this is not normal? - Yeah. - And can we also agree that whoever's behind this, it can't be the rev? - Unfortunately. - Which means it's someone else. - Did I say, "unfortunately"? You know what's not working for me? - The Bucket. - Yup. Why isn't it working for you? - Since the rev's no longer a suspect, the bar's got nothing to do with the hotel or the church. - They do have one thing in common. - What's that? - Hannah Driscoll. - Hannah's got nothing to do with this. - She worked at the Bucket, she was there when I grilled her father, and she has issues with the rev. - But she didn't have issues with the Rust Bucket. Why destroy it? - Okay, let's get the bartender in here and see what we can find out. - Fine. - What was Hannah Driscoll doing for you? - Just bookkeeping, deposits, payroll, like that. - Does she have any reason not to like you? - Why? What did she say to you? - Just answer the question. - I was gonna fire her. - Why? - She was dipping in the till. - Hannah Driscoll? - I told her I was thinking of letting her go right before this freak ball thing. - Can you give us a second? If he was firing her, it would give her motive to destroy the place. - I don't see Hannah stealing. - Nathan, your prom was last century. She had a strong motive to attack me. - I could subpoena her bank records. - I'm sorry, but yeah... yeah, I think you need to do that. - Just heard back from the bank. Hannah Driscoll doesn't have a bank account in Haven. - Damn, I had a good feeling about that one. - But Hannah has $57,000 in an account in Bangor... far enough away to keep it secret from the rev. - Well, you could've led with that. - Mm, could've. - I got nothing to say to you except get the hell off my porch. - Now, that's just unfriendly, considering we just saved your life. - You looking for the Lord in the bottom of a scotch bottle? - I take Him where I find Him. - We're here to see Hannah. - She's not here. - Where is she? - Out. - Where? - Rev. - Don't you call me that! - Reverend Driscoll, I think that Hannah was the one that attacked you. - Then you're a fool, Officer Parker, because I wasn't attacked. - Well, then what would you call it? Did you know that Hannah had almost $60,000 in a bank account? She was fired for stealing from the Rust Bucket. That's why she destroyed it. - That's not possible. - Hey, Hannah? Are you here? - She's not here. She's at the junior high school science club. Oh, I pity you, Nathan. You walk alone, but you think your shadow is the Lord's. But the lord cast you out, and now you're truly alone. - Maybe I am alone. Maybe I always will be. But I'm not trying to lose myself in the bottom of a bottle. - Nathan. Nathan, let's go. - I remember when I was in the science club. Feels like 100 years ago. - That's 'cause it was 100 years ago. - Thank you. - Thanks for helping me out with this. - Hey, that's what... that's what friends do. Now, Bobby, you look exhausted. You're not getting enough sleep. How late did you stay up working on this? - Most of the night. Need to beat your score. - Well, you finish setting up, and I am gonna see if I can bribe a judge or two. - All right, well, I like the way you think. Mary Lou. - Hi! - Hannah, is there someplace we can talk? - Is my father all right? He said that he was gonna take it easy after that... event. - We need to know why you have $57,000 in the bank. - Hannah, were you stealing from the Rust Bucket? Is that why you destroyed it? - Is that what Otis told you? - Is it true? - Otis stopped repaying his bank loan. The bank hired me to audit his books. Call them. They'll confirm. Otis is the one who's skimming. - Otis is stealing? - I earned that money. - How? - Took me seven years, and the bank wasn't my only client. And I didn't put the money in Haven because my father knows everybody, and he... he would find out. - He would find out what? - I would leave him, just like my mother did. - Your mother died. - She died three days after she ran away with the deacon in the church. Not the story my dad tells, is it? If you'll excuse me, I have a few things I have to do before I get back to help Bobby. He has a booth on butterflies. - Butterflies? - Hey, Bobby. You here for practice? - No, I just forgot something in my locker. - If you change your mind, just come on out anytime. The team misses you. - Will do, Coach. - Bobby? Bobby! - Hey! - Crap. This is gonna suck. - All right. - Uh, bench! - Yeah, yeah. The fire alarm. Hopefully that'll get us out of here quickly. Yeah. Hang on. What the hell just happened here? - He's a great kid. - There's nothing strange? You haven't had any problems? - After what Bobby went through with his parents, it's amazing there aren't. Especially since I know Bobby's always felt responsible. - He does? Why? - Survivor's guilt. He's the only one who made it out of the car. - What happened? - Driving home from the family cabin, car lost control. I don't think the kid's had a decent night's sleep since. - Did you see him leave? - Miss Driscoll took him home after the fire alarm. Probably had to wake him up, though. - Wait. Wake him up? - I think he was catching a nap right here in the locker room. Not the first time either, since the accident. - Bobby? Hannah? Anybody home? - What the hell happened here? - Mm, Rev found the bottom of the bottle. - Let's go see if Bobby's in his room. Bobby! - I don't think they came back here. - Hey, do you see that? Does it remind you of anything? - A certain metal ball. And these. The rev's necklace was pulled like a magnet. - Ah, my personal favorite, the hotel cocoon experience. - And the water and the wire in the school hallway... these are the things Bobby sees before he falls asleep. They must be working their way into his dreams. - All right, when you dream, it mixes everything up and it combines it with your fears. The attacks came out of that, and he thought we were coming after him. - Maybe break up his new family. - He's trying to stay awake. He doesn't want to dream. - He knows he's hurting people. - We need to find him before he falls asleep again. - Where would Bobby and Hannah go, Rev? - Why should I tell you? - Sooner you tell me, the sooner I'm out of your house. - Miller's Crust. His parents had a cabin up there. Just past where they were killed at Twin Pines Overlook. Now get the hell out of here! - Works for me. - That boy... isn't one of God's people. He's one of yours, Nathan. That's why I never let you near my daughter, because you would have killed her, just like your people killed my Penny. - Hmm. Way I heard it, she was free of you for three days before she died. Probably the best three days of her life. - All right, you know what? Not now, Nathan. - The troubles are back, like it or not! You find that boy, don't bring him back here! - Kiddo, why don't you lie down, and I'll make you something to eat? Something incredibly unhealthy. - How about just a coffee? - No. When did you start drinking coffee? - A while ago. - You should be sleeping. - Hannah, can we talk about something? - Anything. - What was that stuff about the troubles? - I don't want to talk about it. - All right. Are you okay? - I'm okay. - I know, but it must have been tough... - I'm okay! But thanks. - Bobby, you can't really believe that. - I don't want to, but when I wake up, the things that I dreamed happened. - Sometimes I don't sleep much either, and when I don't, it really messes with how I'm thinking. - That's not what's happening to me. - No. No, I know it isn't. I'm just saying that problems are so much easier to work on when you're rested. And you're so exhausted. - Can we just agree to disagree on that one? - Sure. Hi, this is Hannah. Please leave a message. - Hannah, this is Officer Parker. I need you to make sure that Bobby doesn't fall asleep. I'll explain when we get there. - Twin Pines Overlook's coming up soon. About ten minutes. Uh... - Don't need to say it. - I'm pretty sure that's not gonna help. Bobby must be dreaming. We have to wake him up. Seriously? - What? Ugh. - Whoa, whoa! Why are you speeding up? - I'm not! Bobby is. - Relax, Bobby. You're having a nightmare. - Slow down! - I'm not controlling the car! - Maybe if we're in his dream, he can see us. - Okay, maybe. Why? What are you thinking? - Hey, kiddo! - Are you talking to me? - No, I'm talking to Bobby, honey. Bobby, it's Mommy. Bet you're pumped to get home to your projects, huh? I'm sure it's great. Oh, wait. I have to tell your dad something. Okay, here, it's coming up. Twin Pines Overlook. - No! - Bobby! Bobby, please! - No, stop! Go back! - Just wake up! - Bobby. It can be different this time. You can change things. You can save us this time, Bobby. I know you can. I know you can, Bobby. I trust you. - Dad, don't play with the radio. Dad, don't play with the radio! - Nathan. - No, Dad, don't touch the radio! Watch the road, please! - Okay, Bobby. I'm watching the road. - Whoa! Whoa. - You did it, Bobby. You saved us. Thank you. You saved us. Thank you. - There you go. It's okay, Bobby. I'm here. Bobby, stop dawdling, or we won't make the cabin by nightfall. - He's a different kind of kid, Hannah. - Just like you were. - Like I was. - Appreciate the help! Thanks! - Have you told Bobby why the rev won't let him stay at his house? - Honestly, I don't know how to tell him. He always tries to please my father. That's why he chose butterflies for his science project. - You'll tell him when the time is right. - Nathan, I'm sorry I let my father come between us. - No, it was a long time ago. - Yeah, it was. But sometimes I can't help imagine what my life might've been like if I ignored him and let you take me away from here. - We're doing fine here without you! Anyway... yeah, I never knew my parents. - Do you ever think about them? - You know, there were graduations, proms, things like that that they didn't, you know, show up for. But in a way, you're luckier than me. - Because I knew my parents. - Yeah. And because your new family showed up. So Dr. Carr gave me these for you. - What are these? - Imipramine. It stops night terrors. It should help for now. - For now. - The doc says that it tends not to work on adults. - Oh. Well, thank you, Audrey. - Yeah, so did you talk to the reverend? - It's like we're living like strangers in the same house. He won't even look at me. - I'm sorry. - I saw him at the supermarket, and he looked the other way, just kept moving. But, you know, his shopping cart was full of frozen dinners for one, and I figure that's bound to get old, right? - Yeah. - Thanks. - Well, we had a flood here about ten years ago, so things kind of got shifted around. As you can see, evidence tape's still on there. It's the original. - What is this? A joke? - Definitely not. - What about the photographer who took the picture? Where's the Colorado Kid buried? There are still leads that we could track down. - It's a very old case, Agent Parker. - She might be my mother. - Well, then stay here and find her. - What? - Why don't you come work for me? You know, you have a very rare talent. Most people just want to see things the way they want to see 'em, whereas you see things the way they are. That is a skill that I value. Hell, it's kind of a skill we desperately need around here. - Well, that keeps getting clearer. - So, you know, you could actually make kind of a difference here, and, more importantly for you, I could maybe help you find some of the answers that you're looking for... if you were to stay. - I'll think about it. - Okay. - Your father just offered me a job. - What'd you say? - I said that I would think it over. - Might be a good idea. - Really? What makes you say that? - February 1983. I was seven. I went sledding on that hill right over there. I crashed into a tree, but I felt fine, so I ran back up the hill, ready to go again, and Lisa Bottke took one look at me and threw up. I had blood all over my coat and a bone sticking out of my arm, and I never felt a thing. Wasn't the only thing that happened that year. Don't remember a lot of it, just people whispering, kids pulled out of school. - The troubles. - Couple years later, I got better, and I stopped hearing about them. - And you're afraid they're coming back? - No. They are back. And I'm afraid they won't go away this time. - I might need to stick around for a while and see. - You sure you want to do that? - That crime picture with that woman that I think might be my mother, that was taken around the time that you say the troubles started. - I think it's all connected. - I guess we're gonna find out. You want to grab something to eat? - How about pancakes? - Yeah, I could eat some pancakes.
