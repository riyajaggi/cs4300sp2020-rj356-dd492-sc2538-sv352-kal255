 Haven (2010â€“2015): Season 1, Episode 6 - Fur - full transcript 
 Audrey and Nathan have yet another bizarre case on their hands when a prominent member of the exclusive Haven Hunt Club is found in his car, mauled to to death. It has all of the earmarks of a wolf attack and Chief of Police Wournos, who is also a member of the club, is all set to organize a hunting expedition to track and kill the animal. He reluctantly agrees to Audrey's request for 24 hours to investigate further and there are soon two other attacks, one by a bear and the other by a moose. The moose attack is most revealing since it turns out the animal was stuffed leading them to believe that supernatural causes are actually at work. Their investigation turns up two suspects: Landon Taylor, the taxidermist who stuffed the animals in the first place and Jess Minion who has a reputation for being a witch.

 - Previously on Haven... Watch out! You seriously can't feel pain? - It's called idiopathic neuropathy. Chief Wournos, this is... - Special Agent Audrey Parker. - This could be why I thought I recognized you. - We found that in our newspaper archives from 27 years ago. - All right, I have a theory. - Surprise. - There are two different Havens.

 There's the one that's right beneath the surface, and then there's one right underneath that. - This is a whole new world. - Did you see anything? - Yeah. A big metal ball crushed my place. - You like it. The weirdness. - I've seen this movie. - You know, you have a very rare talent. You see things the way they are. - Crap. All right, can we at least agree that whatever's going on here, this is not normal? - Yeah. - Damn it.

 Aah! - Hey! Hey, what... Eleanor, what are you doing? - Teaching the summer people where not to park. - What? It's a perfectly good parking spot. - Back in '87, the Gibson girl got hit by a car. She couldn't see it, because the car parked here blocked the sight line, so no one parks here now. - And how exactly am I supposed to know that? What about posting a sign? Gah, why does everything in this town have to be such a huge secret? - No one'll talk to you about your mother, huh? - Apparently, I don't have the secret password yet. - Well, you stick out, Audrey. You gotta learn to be a local. For instance, Larissa's baked goods are too dry. Rosemary's are better. Ah, give it 10 or 15 years, kiddo, you'll be fine. - Parker. Hey, where's the Haven Hunt Club? So what is this exactly? I'm picturing a lot of deer heads staring down at everyone. - Yep, except most of the hunting is guys using shots of whiskey to bring down business deals. It's exclusive. Well, not that exclusive. They let my father join. - You mean the chief? - I mean my father. This is his personal life. - And, uh, it's not yours, apparently. - Nope. Not a big fan of killing for fun. - All right, so who's the victim? - T.R. Holt. Divorced, old money. - Whoa! - Consensus says it was a wolf attack, but we'll have to analyze the fur to make sure. Probably rabid. They think it broke the window to get in. - But you don't? - Rabid wolves bite and run. They don't feed like this. - But they break into cars, apparently. All right, so what, he used his head to bash in the window? I mean, unless he's as numb as you are, or he just really, really wanted to get in. Something about this just feels creepy. - Full moon last night. - Oh, look at you, trying to make a werewolf joke. You know, you should smile more often. People will know when you're joking. - Probably. We got a problem. Manager says that Holt was arguing with a guy named Brad Donnelly when he left last night. - All right, and the problem is? - My father. They're both friends of his. - You want to blame this on Brad Donnelly? How does that even begin to make sense? - Chief, wolves don't just... - Look, don't be telling me what they do or what they don't do. I'm looking at what one of 'em did. That animal's got to be killed, that's it. - Before it teaches other wolves to break into cars? - We're gonna organize a hunt. Put out the call for volunteers. You're helping on this. - Putting dozens of men in the forest blasting at everything that moves is not a good idea. - You see, that's exactly where you're wrong. - If we don't investigate and something comes out later, it'll look like you were covering for your buddies. - Look, it's gonna take some time to organize your hunt. All right? So just give us the day. - Okay, take the day. Nothing else better happen. # # - What were T.R. and Donnelly fighting about? - A woman. I don't know who. - Was it the kind of fight worth killing someone over? - How would I know? These guys live to piss on each other. Go find Landon, talk to him. I think he's around here somewhere. - Landon Taylor? Owns the dry cleaners over on Prince? - Yeah. He hangs around here a lot ever since his wife died in that fire. I heard T.R. and Donnelly damn near blew his head off a couple of days ago, fighting about something. - Whenever you're ready, Landon. - Pull! Didn't lead it enough. - Oh, no, you led it fine. Your aim was just low. - I think I can tell, thanks. - Okay, if you think so. - I'm sure you think you could do better? - Oh, by better, do you mean hit the target? - Here. School me. - All right. Keep 'em coming. Pull. Pull! All right, how many of these do I need to do? My shoulder's starting to get sore. - I have been to school, and I have learned. - Can we go talk for a minute, Landon? - You all know why we're here. T.R.'s dead. I want parties to start up by the Derry Road, come back across state land. We'll drive the sucker to the sea. Who's game? - Excuse me. Gentlemen, Mr. Donnelly. - Detective, you joining in? - No, sir. Neither are you. I need you all to stand down. I know you all want to get the animal that did this. That's understandable. But the chief has asked that we hold off till tomorrow. - You saw the car, Wuornos. What's to investigate? - Go on, everybody. Go on. - Gillespie said that you had been shot at? - Yeah? Well... It's no big deal. - Getting shot at is always a big deal. You were with T.R. and Donnelly, right? - Yeah, but, uh... - But... You don't think you were the target? - No. - All right, so who was shooting at who? All right, listen, I don't mean to cause any trouble here. I just... I need to know what happened. - Donnelly fired, a bullet hit a tree right next to me, okay? Scared me half to death. - Donnelly shot at T. R? - I hate to think so. Accidents do happen out there. - Mr. Donnelly, we want to talk to you. - Wait, I've seen you around. You're that FBI girl, Parker. - Oh, keen eyes. Makes me wonder how you missed that shot that you took at T.R. the other day. Coincidences make me curious. - T.R. wasn't shot, and I didn't shoot him. There's a coincidence for you. - But you were fighting with him. - T.R. and I were like brothers. Fought, drank, raised hell... like brothers. Nobody's gonna miss that poor bastard more than me. - Donnelly's hiding something. - Besides his charms? Yeah, I don't doubt it. But I don't buy murder by animal. - Oh, there they are. - Landon confirmed that T.R. shot at Donnelly? - Well, Landon didn't really know one way or another. - Just the people we were looking for. - Don't have anything, for you, fellas. - Unless you want a pastry. - Are those Larissa's? - You bet they are. - Pass. - You should try Rosemary's. - Oh, so I've heard. Hey, uh, can we talk off the record? - That sounds exciting. - He says that when the waiter offers to pepper his salad. - What do you guys know about T.R. and Donnelly? - Apparently, they were quarrelling over a woman. - Oh, there's that Jess Minion woman. She's some kind of animal rights and wrongs person. - The word's "activist," Vince. - She's a witch. - Got that right. - They were fighting over her? - With maybe, not over. I mean, everyone at the club agrees she's a pain in the ass. - Only if you like shooting animals. - Okay, wait, wait. You're a member of the club, Dave? - 35 years. More likely, uh, they were fighting over Brad Donnelly's wife, Susanna. - The dead guy had something with Donnelly's wife? - That's what people were saying, anyway. - It was mostly Dave saying it. - Well, even a rumor of adultery can be enough. Oh, yeah. These are awful. - That's what you've got? - Yeah. - If you take the gossip down at that club serious, half the town would be locked up. - Half the town isn't dead. - Not yet. They expedited your lab work. They just confirmed it an "unusual event," like we didn't already know that. - There's gotta be a connection with Donnelly here, I know it. - Officer Parker, you can know it later, after we get that wolf. - This wasn't an ordinary wolf attack. - This town's scared. Mayor wants a curfew, and I am this close to ordering it, so unless there's some real evidence that you haven't seen fit to mention... Let's get it rolling. The hunt's on. Aah! - Donnelly and T.R. Both within 24 hours? That doesn't just happen. - Don't get a lot of wolf attacks inside people's garages, either. - How are you stocked for silver bullets? - Funny. - I'm not sure that was a joke. - Full moon was last night. How many nights do werewolves get? - There are rules? Who says? - Same guy who says silver bullets actually work. - Come on, let's go talk to his wife. - We have reports the men were fighting over a woman. - You assumed it was me. But I bet it was that Jess Minion woman. She's been hexing us. You didn't know? Right there. She told Brad it was some kind of Micmac witch mark. Supposed to say something to the animals about us. - Thanks, Susanna. If we need you, we'll be in touch. - Sure, but soon as probate clears, I'm moving back to Tallahassee. - Thanks for your time. - Okay, I've seen that mark before at the Hunt Club. - You really think this Jess Minion is a witch? - What? We were just talking about werewolves a second ago, and now witches are out of bounds? She's an animal rights activist, and I saw this mark at the site of the two other attacks. - Witch or not, she's a person of interest. - Okay. So let's be interested. - Took you long enough. I was expecting you last night. - You've been waiting for us? - T.R. is dead. He hated me. Seemed inevitable you'd show up here. You're Audrey Parker, federal agent in exile, and you are Nathan Wuornos, detective, son of chief, and I'm Jess Minion, suspect du jour. - You seem to know a lot for someone who's only been here for a year. You're a Quebecer, aren't you? - Qu?b?coise, yeah. You checked up on me too. This was my grandmother's farm. I summered here as a child. Now it's mine. - All right, back to why T.R. hated you... - I have 90 acres here. I'm letting it go back to what it wants to be. I don't let the club hunt on it. - I've heard reports you've taken a few potshots at them out there. - 5:00 in the morning, how can you tell a banker from a thief? Hard enough in full daylight, right? - Can you explain this? - It's a Micmac hieroglyph. It means offering forgiveness. - Are you aware that Brad Donnelly died last night the same way T.R. did? By a wolf. - I guess they didn't forgive him. Come with me. Each of those stones marks an animal that's died on this land. Wounded by guns, maimed by traps, poisoned. One step from being stuffed and put on display. - Your people kill animals too. - We use them. We don't mock them. If the spirits of these animals come knocking at the doors of these guys, looking for revenge, it's not a crime. That is justice. - Ms. Minion, why do people think that you're a witch? - Maybe because they don't like the way I think. - So you're not a witch. - What's a witch? Someone who does magic? What do you think the troubles are? Magic is everywhere here. It's in the soil, the water, in us. You suffer so much because you can't understand what's happened to you. You know it's not a medical condition, but you don't want to face the real truth. You have been transformed by magic. You're not less, Nathan. You're more. The only thing wrong with you is your perspective. - So where were you last night around 8:00 p. m? - Relax. I didn't kill anyone. If you want to check, call the AAA. Had my car towed in Derry. - Easy enough. Thanks for your time. - Anytime. - I don't believe she's a witch. - Whatever she is, she is interesting. - Brad Donnelly's death... - Is still under investigation. - Guys, we don't have time for this. - What do you think about the reward? - Reward? - Club members pitched in to put a bounty on this wolf. They're shooting for $10,000. - Terrible, isn't it? - Yeah, about time. People are scared. - We'll keep you posted. All right. Okay, so what do we have? We have a wolf inside Donnelly's garage, but do you buy a wild animal stalking its prey indoors? - No, and we have another broken window. It's back to human help. - An animal trainer? Drugged animals? But getting in and out unnoticed? - Tough sell. - What if it's not an animal trainer but more like, uh, you know, an animal whisperer? Somebody who's, I don't know, but can make animals do things. - Like an evil Dr. Dolittle? - Or, you know, like a witch. - Come on. Jess gave the easiest alibi to check. Here. - Oh, wait, what difference does it make about the alibi? I mean, if you can compel animals to do something, you don't have to be there when it happens. - Okay, this is ridiculous. - Just because you like her, that doesn't give her a free pass. - Okay, tell me you got something. - We have a theory. - We have nothing. - Animals are going crazy, and, somehow, someone is causing the attacks. - Nathan's right. You got nothing. In the club, one hour. Oh, bring shotguns. - Hmm! These really are better. - Rosemary's are the best. Zach! What are you doing here, bud? - He woke up lonely for his daddy. - Mom. - He was so worried about you, though, honey, going out hunting again after what happened the other day. - Mom, he's four. He's not worried about me. - Fine. I don't want you to go. That better? - Well, at least you're being honest. - So come on home with us, please. Okay, let's just go outside. - It's us three with the chief. - This is gonna be fun. - Oh, yeah. All kinds of fun. - They're gonna be blasting at their shadows all day. - Where's Vince? - He doesn't hunt. He loves all creatures great and small, he says, usually with fries. - Hold up. This is the back end of the Minion farm. It's posted, we can't go in. - Ever hear of hot pursuit? - Hey, this direction isn't any more likely than another. - Or any less. Look, this is all part of our area to sweep. We're going in. Let's go. - This is a bad idea. - Starting to look like my definition of a good day's hunting. - What? - We're gonna eat lunch before anything lunches on us. Whoa. - No! - What the hell are you doing? - That was a dog! - I don't think you hit it. - Of course not. You hit my gun! - Yeah, I hit your gun! It was Jess Minion's pet! - Oooh! - Oh! - What the... That's stuffed with rags and sand. - Dave, are you all right? What's that? - So much for the werewolf theory. - Yeah, we have real evidence now, but I have no idea what to do with this. - Dave's gotta get checked out. We gotta get him out of here, okay? - Okay. What do you want us to do with this? - Let me worry about this. What I want you two is get out of here and just stop this nonsense. - Nonsense? Like this hunt? - You think this plays out better in the middle of Main Street, Nathan? Is that what you think? Would you just go get Teagues for me like I asked you? Thanks. Like now. - Oh, nice. You know he saved your life, right? - Who do you think's been dealing with all this before you graced us with your presence? Who do you think's gonna be dealing with it after I'm gone? I wanted you in this job because you had a knack with dealing with all this crap. I'm just praying to God some of it rubs off on him. - You know what, he's a lot better at this than you think. - Well, I tell you what, Agent Parker. This is a lot worse than what you think. How you doin', Dave? - That's a weird-looking moose. - Oh, man. You look kind of... - Perfect. - Yeah, perfect. Let's get you home. - All right, we need to go talk to Jess. - I know. - Jess being sympathetic to your problem, it makes a lot more sense if she's troubled too. - Well, if she is, how do we stop it? - If she is, does she want it to be stopped? - You hear that? Are you guys happy now? - Believe it or not, it's not my favorite sound, either, all right? But we don't have time for this. - We've had three animal attacks. At least one of them was stuffed. - Stuffed? You're joking, right? - Both of us were almost killed by one of these things. - I'm sorry that happened, Nathan, but I cannot help you. - Jess, if you're troubled, you might not even be aware you're doing it. You might just think it's part of whatever rituals you're doing. - Nathan, I'm not doing any rituals. I'm not a witch or a shaman or anything like that. The only Micmac was my mother's mother, and she was a half-blood. Most of what I know is just... stories, third-hand legends. - The hieroglyph? - Wikipedia. I'm not troubled, Nathan. I'm just... I'm just me. If I had any kind of power, Officer Parker, those animals never would have died in the first place. - All right, thanks. I think we're done here. - Nathan, everything I said about you is still true. - No werewolf and no witch. - How about some old-fashioned physical evidence? - Taste. The final frontier. - Look. - Oh, man. We're gonna need some help. Well, at least clean-up will be easy. The rags will wipe up the sand. Something smells off. - Might be this. Wolfie had a bedtime snack. Could be a match for T.R.'s. Well, you want to fill me in on everything? Or are my services no longer required? - No, I think we have it from here, thank you. - Yeah, you keep telling yourselves that. Doesn't have to be true to make you feel better. Good luck. - What don't you want her to know? - You know the moose that attacked your dad? This plaque says that he shot one up in Arrow... - Aroostook. Two years ago? - Uh-huh. - You think that was the same one? - Do you see a moose? Wolfie over there, shot by Donnelly. This one by T.R. Holt. The animals are coming alive and killing the people who killed them. - And then they just go back to being stuffed? - See this? I found this on wolfie over there. All of them have them. - C.L. -6? What does that mean? - I don't know what it means, but between the plaques and the tags, we have a timeline. And the most recently killed is coming alive first. - There's some animals missing. - All right, so the first question is, what's bringing them back? - No. First one is, where's the bear? - Who killed it? - Vince, would you just take your damn allergy medicine already? No one cares if it makes you feel slow. No one would notice anyway. Vincent! - What? Do you need something? - Oh! Get me out of here! Vincent! - Help! Help! Help me! Help! Somebody help. Please call the police! - Help! - Yep. It took both of our shotguns to blow the head off that moose. These things are useless. - Ideas? - Yeah, let's turn up the heat. - Fire in the hole! Those are better than silver bullets. - That was damndest thing I've seen in ages! - You can be a little less thrilled, Vince. It almost killed me. - I know! - All right, I know that you guys are excited, but we really need to discuss how you're gonna write about this. - You're worried how it'll look in The Herald? - Does it have to look like anything? - What do you think it's gonna look like, Dave? Uh, rabies? - Right time of year. - Oh, don't worry. We'll think of something, dear. We always do. - Uh, hey, do you guys, uh... do you recognize this? It came off the animal that attacked T.R. - Maker's mark. My bear had one just like it. "C.L. - 6." - Initials? "Canis lupus number six" is my bet. Probably means it's the sixth wolf that Landon Taylor stuffed. I recognize his mark. - Landon? - Hey, Landon? - I'm back here, cleaning up this mess. - Looks like another attack. What happened? - I just came in and found this. Do you think this was one of those rabid animals? - The animals aren't rabid. - You've heard about the troubles, haven't you? - The troubles. - We found this inside an animal that was killed while attacking someone. - Recognize this? - All the attacking animals are stuffed... by you. - This is, uh... this is ours. - It came from the moose the chief killed two years ago. - The animals are killing the people who killed them, and yours must be coming after you too. - If that's true, they'd all have to be destroyed. I mean, all of them... I have to end this. - What are you doing here? - We just came for Landon's help. - Stay away from my son. You're making a mistake. He has nothing to do with this. - Mom, stop. - Landon, get in the car. Go! Go. - I just need to... - Piper, don't! - Ma'am. Down. Down. Let go. Drop it. Drop it. - Ah! - Landon, your arm. - How? - Let me go! He needs me! - No, Landon, wait! Landon, stop! He didn't stuff himself. He's not the cause of this. - It's my fault. It's all my fault. - He said he wanted to destroy all the animals. - He can't do that. - Why? - I can feel them. They're all waking up. - But I thought Landon was the taxidermist. - He was. I never sewed them. I just gave him some of my sewing rags. I... I had no idea that would be enough to... - To bring them back? - When I found him in the fire, his wife was burned. I... I couldn't save her. But Lanny wasn't. He must have just suffocated. He looked like he was still alive. I couldn't help myself. I just... I just couldn't help myself. - So you said that you could feel them waking up? - When Landon came back, I felt it. But then everything was fine until... he almost got shot the other day. And this feeling, it just kept getting stronger and stronger. - Well, from what I've seen, the stress, it makes these things worse. - My father wanted me to be careful. I thought I was. All I ever wanted to do was to keep him safe. - Landon, stop! - Piper, stay here. - He's my son. - Easy, guys, we're on your side. - Speak for yourself. - Landon? Damn it. We gotta hurry. - I'm sorry, but I made you, and I have to stop you. - Landon, get out of there! The animals you killed are waking up! - They're coming for you! - Landon! Landon, stop. - Mom! Open up! We have to kill them! - Piper! - This is my fault. I started this! - Piper! - Piper! - Mom! - If they kill me, they stop and won't come after you! Now go! Mom, get out of there! - It ends with me. - They killed three wolves today. God knows what else. - Is the rabies story sticking? - Not sure I care. One way or another, we'll make everyone think it's all right. - It is, Nathan. It's better, anyway. I think it was the fire that caused Piper's condition to flare up, and then she, uh, revived Landon. So when Landon was almost shot... - Her condition went into overdrive. - So what are we gonna tell him? - The truth. I'm sorry about what happened to your mother. - We're destroying all the animals that your mom brought back just to be safe. - Except for me. Or did you change your minds about that? - Landon, this doesn't have to be so bad. You still have Zach to live for. - Is that what I'm doing? Living? I'm not even real, Officer Parker. - Nathan. - I can't feel that. You and I have a lot in common. We're different, but you know what? Doesn't make us any less than anyone else. In some ways, maybe it makes us even more. You've been this way for how long? Six months? Were you any less a father to him? Did he even notice? - No. - That's right. 'Cause you're more than this. Maybe even a little magic. - Maybe that's true. Come here, buddy. This way. - Do you really believe that, that you're magic? - Not quite. - Well, you just saved that man's life. It may not be magic, but it sure is close. - What now? Did someone else die? - Actually, yes. That's not why I'm here. I came to say I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - What you said was true. I don't know... I don't know about magic, but I'm definitely something... different. Or I could be. - I kind of like you the way you are. - Um... Do you want to get some pancakes? - I don't like pancakes. But I'd love to have breakfast with you. - You wanted to see me, kiddo? - Hey, thanks for coming. Listen, there's a lot going on around here that nobody is telling me, and for some reason... I trust you, Eleanor. - That's your first mistake. - You did the M.E. report, right? You saw what I saw. You saw what was left of Piper. - I saw a lot of rags thrown around the room. - Exactly. - And that's what's going into your report too, isn't it? - Sure. 'Cause that's what goes in a report, right? Piper was stuffed, and then she stuffed her son. It must have been going on for generations, and I just... I just... I couldn't write that down. - I'm guessing you didn't tell Landon the truth, either. - No. I thought if something awful happened to his boy that... Well, if he knew, then he would be tempted to stuff him too. But I... I just don't feel right about this. This is just another secret that's gonna play itself out all over again. - You do what you can... And the world goes on. Here. This'll make you feel better. - Is that Rosemary's? - Yeah. I'm gonna do what I can to help you find out about your mum. - Wait, you would do that? - Well, we gotta stick together up here. You're not a summer person anymore, kid.
