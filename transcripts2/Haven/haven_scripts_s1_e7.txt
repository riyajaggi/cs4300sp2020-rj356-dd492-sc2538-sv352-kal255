 Previously on Haven... You took my clothes. And I saved your life. You must be Duke. Does she know you're not a real boy? Consensus says it was a wolf attack, probably rabid. Something about this just feels creepy. I wanted you because you got a knack for dealing with all this crap. I'm just praying to God some of it rubs off on him. You really think this Jess Minion is a witch? What do you think the troubles are?

 Magic is everywhere here. Whatever she is, she's interesting. I'm gonna do what I can to help you find out about your mom. Really? We gotta stick together up here. The troubles are back, aren't they? Yeah, I think so. All right, boys, let's wipe her down. - Clean her up. - Yes, Captain. - This is nice, right? - Yep. Which makes us wonder why you dragged us all the way out here. Galley wench, we're empty!

 Wench! Beer! Ready, boys? I got a line on a sexy little private equity fund. Like last time? My wallet is still bleeding. I'll pass, thanks. Let's go. Fellas, wait. Where are you going? This deal has huge margins and a killer matrix. I can get you in under the wire if you get me the funds right now. No, thanks, Wally. Fool us once... Boys. Come on. We're talking ground floor here. Guys! Perfect. Damn it. I have your beers. We ran out of imports, so I had to... God! Help! So you saw the prowler? A glimpse. Barely. He was 6'7". One eyebrow. Fu Manchu. Carried a small slingshot. Tattoo. Of what? Does it matter? He was a 6'7", unibrow, sling-shotty monster. You want to swing by? Look for footprints? Yeah. I guess I should. I think he needs to come by, conduct a safety review of your home. Say around 8:00? Great. I shot a deer, so we're having venison. You can bring a nice bottle? - Of wine? - No, antacid. You were all about protecting animals and moving them to safe habitats. I am. I usually use a tranquilizer gun, but it makes them taste funny. Maybe someone should get that? Hello. Nathan police department. I mean, Haven PD. Wuornos speaking. That was painful to watch. No one was forcing you to. "Of wine?" Yeah, we should show that to suspects who won't talk. Okay. It'd probably be cruel and unusual punishment. If my personal life is so painful, maybe you should just stay out of it. - Hey, I'd love to. - But you can't. You're incapable. Numb on the outside, sensitive on the inside. Just a second, guys. - So what happened to him? - Anybody squeamish? Not me, but Nathan's a little sensitive. All right. Ruler-straight. Clean breaks through both femurs on a horizontal axis. Massive damage. - Those are tough bones to have broken. - Tough for something to break. They're as thick as spinnakers, and here, look at this. Identical fracture in the arm. It looks to be at a 90-degree angle to the leg fractures. Did he lose blood? 'Cause his coloring... - What's this? - Well, look at that. I take that to the lab. So he was assaulted. By who? By what? Good question. You know where to find me, should the occasion arise. So you want to go talk to Wall Street, and I'll talk to the Captain? So you called it in? It's my boat. I'm responsible. You remember any weird waves? Loose winch line? Mizzenmast? I'm from Ohio. We were at the dock. I shut down systems have any real power the minute I tie off. And this boat is cutting edge in terms of safety, technology. Yeah, this is a pretty nice operation you have here. A little off the beaten path, so the extra touches help me compete. Tell me about the victim? Wallace is loaded. High-end tastes. My bread and butter really. - Were they having a good time? - Blue water, big fish, cold beer. Who's not having a good time? Me. Dragging a hook, that is not my thing. You'd never make it on Wall Street. Thank you. - They claim they didn't see anything. - Do you believe 'em? Kept my hand on my wallet the whole time. Stories line up. They say they left him with the crew. Took me a while to get their beers. - If I'd come up sooner... - Had nothing to do with it. - Nothing at all. - So you're her father? - And Jimmy? - I'm her fiance. So this is... a family crew. Great. Personally, I wish she wasn't working on the boat. Teacher's salary's small, dad. We need the money. But against my better judgment, Vickie suddenly started picking shifts. More time with Jimmy. And you. All right, so you brought the beers. And I stepped onto the deck, and there was this crunching sound, and then he was... he was down. You didn't see anything? No, no, we were on the bow cleaning up from the day's fishing. Hosing off the spilled wine and pate. You didn't catch anything? - The thing they wanna catch is a buzz. - Jimmy, go muck out the chain lockers. Please. Fact of the matter is these guys get annoying as hell. It bothers Jimmy how hard we work for them. I mean, hell, it bothers me. But that's the way it is for deckhands. You'd think having an old man who was one would have steered her away. Maybe he was pinched between the boat and the dock. - One minute. - Lots of power in a drifting boat. 55 seconds, that's all we've got. - For what? - To rule out what's normal. All right, so let's keep going. Sudden acute early onset osteoporosis? Not likely. Sudden bone-crushing weight gain? I guess the pate could do that. How about boats are dangerous? He was at a dock on a powered-down boat that's nicer than my apartment. And Vickie saw him crunch in a pretty weird way. You're convinced already this... Yes, because nothing I've seen lines up except for two ruler-straight breaks on Wallace's legs. And I'm pretty sure Eleanor winked at me. - What? - She's a doctor. She knows when things aren't normal. And I'm getting the feeling she knows a lot more. - She winked at you? - There was winkage. Maybe you're right. I just sometimes I wish we could get a normal... - Brutal assault? - Doesn't that sound kinda nice? Why would that be any better? It wouldn't remind me of my own problem. How does any of this remind you that you have no game with chicks? Thanks. Okay, let's say it's not something normal. What now? We go to lunch. But you're not gonna like it. Colorado Kids - La Fabrique www.sous-titres.eu Episode 107 Sketchy Duke? Haven's finest. I could add "ass" to that, "Haven's finest ass," and it would still work for both of you. Just in different ways. You guys want something to drink? Beer? Wine? Clamato? Or you could tell us what's behind the tarp. That is the central mystery of life on the water, isn't it? What is behind the tarp? What is behind the tarp? So many have asked. So few ever... find out. We had a guy standing on the back of a boat who suffered from some ruler-straight injuries. Broke both his legs right across here. Boom? I don't know what sound it made. I know why he's a boat expert. Come on, I was kidding. - It was funny. - Joke. Not a sailboat. Sport fisher. - Deep-V hull. - Somebody else's boom. The ocean, she be a mysterious and dangerous place. Like a tarp. Sure. just tell us what's behind it. - Something I'm trying to protect. - Because you're a model citizen? I have a code. Just one that says I don't have to show you. In fact, not showing you will probably be the most fun that I have today. Alas... I hate to see a beautiful woman suffer. Pam Seligson, she's the town librarian. It's her 80th birthday. Asked me to hide the setup. I smuggled it. All of it, - from Iceland. - That is really sweet, Duke. So glad we came. Nathan, you there, sugar? Copy, Laverne. You better get up to tradewinds real estate, doll. Sounds like somebody got pretty PO'd at their broker. Bye, Audrey. You too, sugar. Ten years on the job, I've never seen anything like it. - Who is that? - Joe Santomauro. - Real estate agent. - And what happened to him? He's been... sliced all the way through, like a big loaf of bread. Look familiar? What's this have to do with our fractured friend Wallace? Did anybody see what happened? Yes. Him. So Joe was a successful real estate broker? I don't wanna gossip. Joe was a little ethically challenged. Double-dipped on commissions. When the market contracted, the whisper was he started working with a less-desirable element. Not tradewinds real estate kind of people. Here's my card if you need me. Will do. All right, so this Joe seems like a swell guy. He learned his ethics in the same scout troop as Mr. Wallace? He's been indicted four times. Fraud times two, tax evasion times two. Okay, so let's just say that Joe did deserve Alec's wrath. We still have ten witnesses that say he never touched him. But he was sitting right in front of Joe. What's Alec, a telekinetic vigilante taking down Haven's scum? - Doesn't seem like the type. - No. Then why would Alec place himself at the second crime scene - when we've seen him at the first? - He wouldn't. Unless... unless he can't control himself. Then Joe just started sliding out of his seat onto the floor. Like he was getting... pulled by something... and cut. What were you doing at Joe's office? - I've been trying to sell my house. - You're moving? No, it just seemed... like time to cash out. - But Joe didn't get any offers. - That must had pissed you off. Having a guy who makes much money not be able to help you out. You're getting long in the tooth. How's the retirement plan coming? What? You being tired and mad, standing in the middle of two rich guys who took it on the chin yesterday. That's what I'm talking about, Alec. I didn't touch anybody, and there are witnesses. You know it must be tough wiping decks for a living, catering to a bunch of rich slobs, and then making your daughter schlep them drinks while they look her up, down like a piece of meat. What the hell is wrong with you? My fault. I'm sorry. What if you had gotten him mad and something did happen? A bucket of cold water. It works on dogs. Anyway, he didn't hulk out on us, so obviously he's not our guy. It's damn near scientific. Have you ever had a situation though like this before, when Haven was dealing with the troubles back then? What do you mean? Both of our victims were real dirtbags, con artists, so this whole thing, it just... it feels pointed, like someone's in control of what they're doing. Couldn't that be a good thing? Yeah, or a very, very bad thing. Lab results on that black substance. Atomized graphite. - Graphite, like a lubricant? - Willow charcoal and a little clay. If it was a lubricant, whatever it was... It's sketching charcoal. Nathan! I know why you're here, love. - No, you don't, Mary. - Got your order here. Clear varnish for decoupage. You do decoupage? Mary, do you sell graphite and willow charcoal? - Where do you decoupage, Wuornos? - Someplace private. So graphite and willow-based charcoal? Dusty but has nice, rich luster. - Gives great shadows. - Anybody in town buy it? I'm not great with records. I could print you out a copy of my restocking report. Maybe I made a note of who bought it when. That would be great. What is decoupage? And why do you varnish the pictures? It tints all the colors. It connects them. So because you can't feel, all your other senses like sight, they're elevated. For instance, right now my hearing seems very acute. I'm just trying to get to know you, all right? How are we get to know each other if we never talk? You can ask me stuff if you want. Go ahead, I'm an open book. Hit me. Shoot. - What do you think about Jimmy? - Jimmy? He bought willow charcoal. I heard Alec bossing him around on the boat the other day, then barking at him in front of Vickie. You think that's reason enough to set up your father-in-law for murder? Maybe, but if Jimmy knows that we're on to him and he's the guy that's doing all this... Telekinetic slicing and breaking of people. He's not exactly the kind of guy we can walk on up to and mirandize him. We need to sneak up on him. What exactly do you want me to do? Use your boat to get close to The Endorfin. A police boat is gonna stick out like a sore thumb. You remember when I asked you to help me with those parking tickets? You turned me down. This is more important than parking tickets. That's a matter of perspective, Nathan. Those things get expensive. Seriously, I'm just asking for a favor. I'm sensing a dangerous trend here. Truth? That would be nice. The Endorfin is a high-end fishing charter. It takes out big-ticket customers who want big-ticket items. - I can get those things. - You do business with them? Yeah. In fact I'm getting them a delivery of some very expensive noble grape. Don't worry. I paid the customs fees. And so protecting your business with the owner is more important than helping us? Does it have to be an either/or? Come on. I have another idea. Good luck. 50 cc's of Diazepam. Drops a grizzly bear in ten seconds. Do you have anything stronger? - We don't know who we're up against. - We're just gonna talk to him. But if anything happens to us, just tranq him. Anything like what? Like we start bleeding or screaming, or stuff like that. - And if it gets dangerous... - I put it in his neck, fastest place. I was gonna say "run". I don't want you at risk here. This isn't your job. Okay, I'm fine. Happy to help you. Not the date you were expecting, is it? But it's coming up, right? Right. Hey, Jimmy. What are you doing? What I'm always doing. I'm making it perfect. That would drive me crazy. What? Just having to spend the day with a bunch of tourist fat cats telling me what to do. That's not fair. Yeah, I know. You wouldn't believe some of their... Jimmy? What's wrong? Oh my God. There... that should keep him sedated for a while. You want some? I'm fine. I'm sorry to bother you. I didn't want to take him to the hospital. They wouldn't take him anyway with no health insurance. You did the right thing bringing him here. On some levels, he is the perfect houseguest. - You can joke about this? - I can always joke. How else does one get through a winter in Haven, Maine? - It's the troubles, isn't it? - I guess so. Wait. Why are they here? I don't know. Maybe it's some kind of cosmic test of our character. If this is a test, you get an A+, and I get a "You suck". You're doing fine. I am? Really? Because to be honest with you, I'm kinda freakin'. There is something attacking people intentionally, and it, whatever it is, it knows that I am on to it. The FBI never trained me for the troubles. I suppose not. God, why can't I just walk away from this town? You could, but we both know Haven has its charms. Is that what you really want, to leave, go back to the FBI? I want to find this thing. And? And I want to kick its ass. Is Jimmy going to be okay? I don't know. You saw that weirdness. And I thought you were really brave. What did I do that was brave? You didn't pee yourself. - You should go home, Jess. - Really? - Why? I can help. - How? How can you help? There's a guy in the next room who just lost his face. There's another down at the morgue who was shredded. I'm in the middle of a freak show here. This isn't any place for a normal girl... with good intentions. You came to me. I shouldn't have. You should go. Fine. See you around. Guess what subject Vickie teaches. Art. Vickie. - Beautiful. - Thank you. - Can we talk for a minute? - Is this about my father? What about your father? Nothing. I couldn't reach him earlier. I'm sure he just forgot to charge his cell phone again. You're lying. I'm in the middle of class. We could always ask you to join us at the station, and we could talk there. You can't make me go anywhere unless you arrest me. If you need some help... If you want to help me, leave me alone. I have to get back to my class. Really? "We can always ask you to join us at the station "if you want to talk there." She's worried about her dad. And I'm betting she doesn't know what happened to Jimmy. She's definitely hiding something. Whatever it is, maybe we can find evidence of it at her house. There's no law against looking in windows. Or against checking for locks. Parker. Look at that. Blankets in the windows? Someone is definitely hiding something. Looks like somebody trashed the place. That's too bad, 'cause some of these are really good. Wind. Inside. Sure. Looks like somebody took these in a hurry. Or stolen. Hey, Nathan. Here's a finished one someone forgot. Look familiar? Nathan! All right. Vickie left the school, I put out an APB. We can arrest her now. I agree we should, but for what? Illegal manufacture and use of voodoo drawings? - When I touched your image... - I was there. Right. So I'm guessing that Wallace was folded and Santomauro was shredded. And Jimmy - got erased? - The question is: Where are all the other people that she sketched? Not just people. I stepped on this. The drawings affect things too. But why is she scared if she's in control? And why use her drawings to go after Jimmy and a banker and a Realtor? Let's ask. The banker's probably conscious now. No, wait. I don't want to leave this here unguarded, but I don't want to touch it either. So what do you wanna do? I'll call Settle. Ask him to come watch. And are you gonna tell him why? 'Cause I think it's really good. Mr. Wallace. If you're lawyers, save your breath. Unless you've got a 30 mil settlement. We're cops. - You figure out what happened to me? - Yeah. What we wanna know is why? I want to know what first. And you're in a hospital bed, attached to tubes. We could leave. Now. Okay, see ya. I was gonna pay the money I owed. To who? Vickie? No. - Richards. - Captain Richards? I only owed him 200 large. 300, whatever. Suddenly he was a maniac about collecting it. Normally he's happy to earn the interest. You owed him $300,000 from fishing? No, I owe him 300,000 because of a stupid parlay - and the Jets can't make a field goal. - You bet on the Jets? What about Joe Santomauro? Did he owe Richards money too? Probably. I saw him out there a few times. Worst poker player ever. But I think they had a real estate deal cooking. Based on what I heard about Joe, guessing it went South. So The Endorfin's more than just a fishing charter? He's fishing. Guys like me. Rich enough to have a couple of drinks and get in hock with him. So... Vickie is muscle for Richards? Let's go ask why. Patrol car picked her up. What about me? You got involved with the wrong kinda people. Like I don't know that. Why are you drawing that? - It's pretty. - No, that's not why. - We know what you can do. - And you're working for Richards. I'm sorry, I have no idea what you're talking... No, what we don't know is why you drew Jimmy. Jimmy? Is he okay? He's okay. I don't want to do this. I tried to stop. Why don't you? My dad. Richards, he has my dad hostage. A few days ago, I went down to the boat to sketch. I used to like sketching. There was a seal on the pier. I drew it, gave it to Richards. He crumpled it. We both saw what happened. And he figured out what your sketches could do. He came to see me the next day and said my dad had been gambling on his boat, owed a lot of money, that he'd be working for free forever. But I could help pay off my dad's debt by giving him some sketches. He was only gonna use them to pressure people. I know how hard my dad works. So you drew. Yes, but when Richards started hurting people, I told him I wouldn't do it anymore. So he got mad. He grabbed my dad and told me if I didn't draw this place by 5:00, he was gonna kill him. Why this place? I know he tried to buy it recently. That would explain why he tried to collect all that money. And why Joe Santomauro, his real estate agent, got punished when he couldn't make the deal happen. And so if Richards couldn't buy this place... He's gonna use her drawings to destroy it. Why didn't you just draw a picture of Richards? I did. But the only sketch that works is the first one I draw. Richards has the one I did of him hidden on that boat. And why did you draw Jimmy? I drew him before I knew any of this was happening. I drew a bunch of people. I drew half the town. When Richards came and took my dad, he took all of my sketches. If he has all the sketches, he could hurt people before we take him. Not just someone. He has a landscape that I did from up on King's Point. Hello. Out-of-towner. What's King's Point? It's the lookout spot. You can see the whole town from up there. Remember the vase? I'd better call for backup. Permission to come. All right, I'll knock next time. Duke! - What are you bringing me? - Well, today... I have got a lovely '68 Ch?teau Latour. Old-growth vines. Unfortunately for them but fortunately for us, it disappeared from a French farmer's cellar - after he croaked. - And how'd you get it? Excuse me? What? I just thought we kind of agreed if we were gonna do business, we wouldn't ask a lot of questions. That's exactly why I like dealing with you. - How's three grand sound? - Five sounds better. And four gets her done? Yes, it does. Keep it cool. - Hate to blow 40 years in a cellar. - You know, I think... I think things are really gonna start picking up for me. Could probably do more business if you're interested. I'm always interested. All right then. I have company. You know them? Yeah, unfortunately, I do. Would probably be better for both of us if they didn't see me here. Okay. - Put these in the cold box below. - All right. Vickie? Detectives? We know what you did to Wallace and Santomauro. I'm sorry? - What? - We want to make a deal. Vickie, you got an Agent. I'm a businessman. What deal? Give us all her pictures, and we won't shoot you. She's not very good. She should know knowledge is power. And she should know... I hold all the cards. You give me what I asked for, and you two go away. Or better yet, Vickie, - draw them. - You're not hearing me. No. You're not hearing me. You're hearing me now? You think you can kill me before I crumple this, destroy the whole town? No. This really works. - What took you so long? - I'm sorry. It takes me a second to pick a safe. Well, that's a shock. Besides, I had to pry open a door to get that guy out. I don't want this anymore. Okay, hold this. Be careful with it. The picture. I can't get it. Damn it. Here, I thought you might like these. These aren't decorations. God, no. Good, 'cause, I got a kinda funky Mexican farmhouse thing going on. I don't want it to clash. I'll be extra careful with these. Jimmy's recovering. He looks pretty good. Yeah, he had a little help from his fianc?e. Do you think he's going to be okay? Yeah, I do. Audrey. You kicked its ass. Nathan. Hey, Jess. Are you okay? Yeah. Came to see about that prowler. Really? It's not too dangerous? Hope not. Dirty Martini number two. Are these happy Martinis or sad Martinis? It's because I want to thank you, but that seems almost impossible. I figure with a big bill, I can give you a good tip. - All right. - No seriously, thank you, Duke, for coming through when I called. Sure. About those parking tickets... Why is it so hard for you to thank me? I don't know. 'Cause every time we start to be nice to each other something blows it up. Maybe you just ask way too much of me. I mean, the poking around, the judging. The secret to happiness with men? Lower your expectations. Everybody knows that. Why can't you do it? I'm drinking this swill, aren't I?
