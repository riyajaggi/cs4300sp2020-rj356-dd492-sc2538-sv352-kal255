No, I think I've answered more than enough questions for one day. Oh, well, done. Okay, so how's a fellow get out of this place? It's blacker than a coalminer's ass. Would you please remain seated, Mr Berry? Someone will assist you. Get your hands off me. Get your hands... ...off me! Shit. Whisky! Good morning and afternoon. Welcome to the British Open, where golfers and golfing come together for golfing. Hey, clapping. Uh, Matt, this is a very difficult shot. What do you think? I don't know anything about golf. Thanks. Uh, I'm getting something from my earpiece. Uh, my neighbour's been kidnapped! Nice hat! Oi, off the green! - Fuck off. - I said off the green. Yeah? Rot rot hubba hubba ding dong do Hubba hubba do all day Lap lap lagga lagga ling long lag Everything went dark Everybody! Rot rot hubba hubba ding dong do Hubba hubba do all day Lap lap lagga lagga ling long lag Rich! Rich! - Rich! - Ahh! Oh, uh... Um, Henry, I was going to sing your favourite song this evening, but unfortunately I can't play the piano. Lucky for you. First, I want to thank everyone for turning out this evening. Especially Matt and my beautiful date, Theresa. But most importantly, I'd like to thank Henry, Club Member of the Year. But also Henry, Person of the Year. Henry, Person of the Year. Henry, Person of the Year. - Henry, Person of the Year. - Oh, God. - Henry, Person of the Year. - How embarrassing. - Henry, Person of the Year. - Chap's lost his marbles. - His noggin's gone. - Henry, Person of the Year. - It's alright, he's done this before. - Henry, Person of the Year. - I say, Berry, what the hell's going on? - Henry, Person of the Year. It's alright, he's just got stuck. - Henry, Person of the Year. - Okay, let's drink. - Henry, Person of the Year. - In time. Henry, Person of the Year. - Henry, Person of the Year. - He could go on all day. Henry... Hello there, beautiful - Oh, hello. - Piss off. I guess I needed a shorter lead. - There we are. - Oh, thank you so much. You're such a gentlemen. Well, it has been said that I'm a gentleman but never a gentle man. - Can I accompany you on your journey? - Sure. I've got to get Scotty back to my boyfriend and then... Fuck you! Seafood! Seafood! Seafood! Seafood! Cockles, lots of mussels, lots of white ones for you Cockles, lots of mussels, lots of white ones for you Right, now, that seafood lad's been there for years. Okay, a word of caution. You eat any of that and you'll be shitting through the eye of a needle. Now, we find ourselves at Whitechapel at the year of our Lord, 1888. Ar hour ago, the body of a young, unfortunate woman was found right there on Buck's Row. "Nothing strange about that," I hear you say. Thing is, she'd been cut from belly to gizzard. Right, I'm gonna take you down to Hanbury Street one week after the murder we've just seen... Hold up, I'm buzzing. It's my agent. You'll have to forgive me. Starlight Express! Fuck, yes! There you go, chief. The stage calls! Uh... Jack...the Ripper. Jack the Ripper, um, was a mean guy. Ungood, if you will In fact, he was so mean that he not only killed his "viketims"... Oh, no, that wasn't enough. ...he had to steal their wallets and briefcases as well Prostitutes didn't carry briefcases in those days. You are so fucking naive, little boy. These women weren't that sex word that you said. They were actually highly trained doctors. Now, you're probably wondering who the identity of Jack Rippy is. And I shall tell you at this point. It's James Bond! The super-duper spy. That's gotta be bullshit. Can I have my three quid back? Um, my neighbour's been kidnapped. Oh! Have a care, chief. Half-price seafood! Cockles, winkles, mussels. Half price. So, what do you use? Well, I use my girlfriend's Mac. But given a choice, I'd sling it, I'd buy a PC any day. What's wrong with Macs? Well, they're aimed at kids and posers, aren't they? You want a computer that looks like a computer, not a fucking cigarette case. So, why would you say something stupid like that? Because I don't like fucking Macs! What kind of computer do you use, Rich? Oh, I use a Mac. They're much better for making my squirrel movies. - Exactly. - And you prefer the Mac, right? - Oh, yeah, like I said... - Not you, you prick. The condemned chap. I've used both. You'll have to speak up, fellow. I can't hear you with that white hood on. I've used both at work. But to be honest, if push came to shove I'd never use a Mac. Not only do they look odd... "Not only do they look odd, but they... Ooh, my neck hurts." - Henry, Person of the Year. Henry... - Not only do they look odd, I don't think they're as versatile as a PC. Fine if you're a teenager. But I hated being a teenager. Exactly. I've always been a PC man myself. Henry, Person of the Year. Henry, Person of the Year. Henry, Person of the Year. Listen, I know Rich hasn't finished his toast, but, uh, why don't we pop upstairs? I've got a private room up there. I could show you my hard drive. Henry, Person of the Year. Henry... Well, I am Rich's date. Well, he won't care. We often sup from the same font. It gives him something to talk about. And what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. ...Person of the Year. Henry, Person of the Year. - Henry, Person of the Year. - I'll get my bag. You get your bag. Henry, Person of the Year. Okay, everybody, let's rock 'n' roll! - Hey, we good to go, Max? - Yo! - We cool for sound, Tommy? - Yeah, I'm cool Alright. Hello. Hey. How you doing? I'm Dick Bent. Christopher Lee. Thanks a buttload for coming in last minute, okay? You really got me out of a tight spot. Speaking of tight spots, meet Candy Blue. I'm killing myself. Hey, listen. Candy is the best in the business. You're in good hand. I mean, she could suck for fucking Hoover. Candy, meet Lee. Christopher Lee, actually. Hey, listen,you got all your props? - Tabasco? - Yes. - Oatmeal? - Yes. - Monkeywrench? - Yes. - You know your lines? - Of course. - You horny? - Yes. Alright, you don't seem to be having too much fun, huh? Treat it like a party. Have a good time. Hey, do you want one of these cock sweets? - No. - Alright. Okay, you know the scene. Do your lines and then waist height, right, Candy? Okay. Alright, let's get goin'! And action, sugar tits! I don't have enough money to pay for the pizza. How am I ever going to repay you? Okay, slut muff, the time for bullshit has passed. 'Cause I've heard you like it... Hey! Cut, cut, cut, cut! Whoa! Hey. You're scaring her. Huh? What do you want her to do, come or shit all over the floor? You're scaring me, goddamn it! Look at you! Now, repeat after me. I am a sexy man-god. I am a sexy man-god. I am a sexy fucking man-god. I am a sexy man-god. Alright, Candy, come in here. This is for the money shot, okay? So no loose change on the floor. Let's get ready. And cocks ahoy, limey! What a charming prospect. The offer of oral copulation in exchange for pizza. If only the Battle of Trafalgar - was won in such a fashion. - Cut! Somebody get me a cock sweet. Frankenstein, you're fired. Do you think the song's too short? No, it's great. I timed it. It's seven seconds long. Yeah, but it's a kick-ass seven seconds. That is true. Do you hear that shit? Yeah. That sounds like Elton John. I was told he was in hospital Dicky ticker. Well, I'll tick his fucking licker if he doesn't have a good excuse for being in our rehearsal room. Too right. - Are you ready? - Yeah. - Are you focused? - Uh-huh. - Is he gonna get it? - You betcha. Hey, asshole. Do you have trouble seeing through those stupid glasses of yours, huh? - What? - Shut up. I'm talking to you, dickhead. Did you look at the schedule? It says Berry and Fulcher, eight till late! - I'm sorry. - Shut up! Well, it's 1:00, prick-lick. I suggest you vamoose it, and take your rocket man with you. What's the buzz, Rich? There's other pianos here. Shut the fuck up! Are you deaf as well as blind? This is our room! Where we create our magic! So get the fuck, lady muck! And what if I refuse? Oooooh. Would these help, Elton? Hmm. "I want my heart pills." There, you prick. - You just killed Elton John. - You killed Elton John. I just yelled at him! You put the lid on his fingers! - You wound him up. - Well, what the fuck are we gonna do? Do you remember how we dealt with Joe Cocker? Vaguely. I mostly watched. Okay, cut his head off with this. I'll give it to Iqbal Put the rest of him in this. We can stick it in the piano. I'll hold his hair back. Come on! Right, I'm making an incision Just below the rapid-exchange dilation catheter. Near the descending aorta so the blood flow doesn't coagulate into the small diameter graphs from non-vascular ortologist tissues. And how long should the cardiograph construction take? Mmm, no longer than 10 minutes. Hold that, please. God. Look, there's something diabolical going on in green wing. I've got leave immediately. Can you take over, please? Right. Okay. Now, uh... Oh, did you see what I just did there? It's very important to keep warm hands during surgery. This will increase the blood flow to the cosmic... dogmastiton. - The what? - I haven't got time to repeat things. There's a life at stake here. Now, note the colour of the blood is red, which is highly unusual See, when the homoglobin is this dark, it means the patient is very sick. So we need to get rid of this blood. Out you go! Out you go! Out you go! Doctor, we're losing vitals. Blood pressure is 90 over 40. Oh, this is a common reaction to blood takey-outey. See, the body needs to grow new homoglobes, which should take around three to five minutes. You can't grow new blood. "You can't grow new blood." What a retard. - Doctor, we're losing him. - He's right here. That's a medical joke you will learn. You can actually write that down. - He's flat lining! - Ah. This is from the television movies. We need to perform a heart massage. Okay. Will this massage have a happy ending? You can write that one down as well Now, notice how gentle she is. Because the heart will squish when you squeeze it. Live, live. Live, live, live! Everybody. Live! Live, live! He's dead. Okay. That concludes our lecture today, I guess. Now, the subject of lunch. They will be serving fish cakes in the cafeteria. Fish were invented in 1974, which is the year I also lost my virginity. It's the Victoria Park Hotel I've got one room there, but it's only got a single bed. That sounds alright, doesn't it? Listen, I'll catch up - with you later, okay? - Yeah. Bye, Matt. - Can't wait. - It was lovely talking to you. You, too. Bye, Tanya. Oh, Rich, didn't see you there. Thanks for dinner and the flowers and writing that song especially for me. Yeah. Bye. Tanya. - What was that all about? - What was what all about? You just massively cock-blocked me. What blocked you? When one man blocks another man's cock it's called a cock-block. I was clearly talking to that woman first and then you butted in. Who gives a shit? It's a free country. Not in Cockblockovia, it's not. If I start to talk to someone, you can't move in! It's in the cockstitution. I wasn't gonna do anything. I've got a girlfriend. Oh, that's the worst kind. The cock-blocker with a girlfriend. It's not enough that you're getting attention from one girl No! You have to get attention from mine! You want to take it up a level? - Maybe. - I didn't notice her name tattooed on your forehead. I didn't see your name branded on her ass, but that doesn't change anything. - Sit down. - No. Sit down! Well, maybe I am gonna sit down, but it's not 'cause you told me. It's because I have shingles in my butt. That was pretty good. - Nice guitar. - Yeah, it's really nice. Yeah. What's that, Ken? - Ken wants to speak to you. - Oh, hey, Ken. - Oh! - Cock-block that. I think you broke my fucking neck! We are joined by Mr Rich Fulcher from America. He works as an assistant to the hangman. You have two minutes, Mr Fulcher, on your chosen subject, Anglo-Saxon architecture, starting now. Which part of the post-Roman Ripon Cathedral still survives? - The water. - Incorrect. Oh... Sir Whiston's Church houses the tombs of the rulers of which kingdom? Kingdom come. - Incorrect. - Oh. All Saints' Church at Brixworth in Northamptonshire contained what unusual feature? - Brixworth. Brixworth. Bricks! - Incorrect. The Leaning Tower of Dildo? Incorrect. Uh, Toto from the Wizard of Oz? Incorrect. - Elvis? - Incorrect. - Titties. - Incorrect. Did you get through to the Mastermind Round of Champions? - Yeah. You? - Oh, yeah. You gonna go? No. You? No. Yeah, I think the questions on that show are too easy. They get easier and easier. Now, if you wanna know a really tough show, it's Jeopardy! I'm a genius at Jeopardy! And you know what? I beat my dad all the time. Granted, he is mentally ill, and he drools all the time. I couldn't sleep at nights then Awoken by the faces of a thousand dead men What kind of beast kills for pain? I knew I'd go to hell on Judgement Day But why should I be so sad? The hours are good and the money's not bad I think of all the jobs that I could have gone into Sweeping up carts, driving trains to Waterloo I could've been a painter or the world's greatest wit I could've been a sailor but the hat didn't fit I'm the hangman Take my hand Come with me It's okay You'll be free Matt?

Hey, I'm Tom Dildo back with you on Real-Life Bloopers. And this next bloofer... I mean blooper! ...was submitted by Charles Clarkson of Bedford. Let's take a look, shall we? Oh, I know this.
