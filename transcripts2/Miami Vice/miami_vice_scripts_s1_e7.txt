Are we gonna pop this guy or what? Everybody, stay loose. There's too many people around. Tell me about it. The girls can't last too much longer. I hope you're right. Let's move it One, two, three, four. Should have seen him in the '50s.

 He was the best. I did see him in the '50s. Did ya? Oh. This is wrong, all wrong. Pack it in. I'll pick up Tubbs and Zito. Everybody, hold. Zito, no time for dessert. Get them out of here. Okay, guys, let's get up. Let's act naturally. We're gonna take a walk, okay? We're gonna go inside, okay? Come on. Let's go. That's him. It's a go. - Hey, take the chairs with 'em, man. Zito. We got the grenades. You got the cash? Well, I ran into a little snag. I'm gonna need a couple more days. Hey, no snag, no more days. The money's in the bag. Open it, please. Okay. Hold it! Police! You all right? Hell, no, I'm not all right. You all right, lady? I hate machine guns. What's the problem? I hate machine guns! What are you yelling about? When I get shot at by a 30 caliber M-60 machine gun, I get scared! And when I get scared, I get angry! You! Hey. Hey... Hey, hey, hey, hey! I want to know who's selling you punks machine guns! Hey, calm down, Tubbs! Calm down! - I will not calm down! Machine guns affect my ability to perform, and I don't like that! Nobody got hurt, right? So, that's good, right? Yeah, perfect, but one thing, farm boy! Just using that kind of artillery is what's gonna get you a hotter seat, pal. Front row for the full 10-year run! The guys in the van... one was called Gentle, the other was Ramone. They're from Ohio, I think. That's all I know about 'em. Look, we don't care about the errand boys. Who do they work for, huh? A hell of a way to start the day, huh? You're tellin' me. Breakfast with an M-60 machine gun. Yeah? Lieutenant, we've got that information we've been looking for. The runner's name is Tony Amato. We need court orders for a tap on the phone, the house, the boat, the office, the car, everything... the whole enchilada. Amato's an international gun merchant, sometime smuggler. Why the street? That's what we want to find out. I doubt this hillbilly is throwing us a fake. No. Amato's not a name you pull out of a hat. Let's get into his laundry. It's probably dirty. Lester, come on. I got a job for you. That's our boy. Are we sure no one's here? Uh, no. Good. We'll have 30 seconds to shut off the alarm once the circuit is broken. Where's the switch located? That's the million-dollar question. Thirty seconds. Eight-to-five it's in the closet. We got 20 seconds. Voilà. Thirteen seconds. James Bond, my man. Nino Cerruti. Fioravanti. Adolfo. Huh. I checked this dude's wardrobe, man. Some wardrobe. I'm not talkin' about the kind that has tags on it, that read "machine washable" either. You know, I hate goin' through people's dirty laundry. Yeah? Well, if you want to get a line on someone, that's what you gotta do. This guy's a real swinger. Check this out. "The Arsenal of Democracy." Your perfect catalog for any last-minute Christmas shopping. You want to put in an order? Do they gift wrap? Look at that, man. Prices, specifications, everything. Just like a Sears-Roebuck catalog. Hey, I think you better put this back where you got it from, buddy. Yeah. I think we'll put the eye on this guy from the bay. Sounds like a winner. How's it goin', Lester? Take a look, Tubbs. So, what's this doohickey here? That changes the power. You got times 10 now. That's times 20. All right. It's nice. It goes to times 200. Oh, man, that's great! I've put each bug on a separate channel. There are two tape recorders, voice-activated. So, if you're monitoring one bug, you can record another and listen to it later. This is a sonic-integrated digital reader for the phone. Oh, yeah, right. The "satta-fortis" and the "ratta-bum" and the "hantoun rantoun." Come on, Lester, you want to give me that in English now? Someone punches a telephone number, this records the tones. When you play it back, the numbers appear here. That's in case you want to know the number they dialed. Amazing. - Not really. The telephone is a digit-to-tone-to-digit system... Hey, not that, man. This. Check this out, man. Ooh, this chick is some kind of limber. Hey, Crockett, come check this thing out, man. Oops. Uh-oh. What is it? - I see some turkey over there watchin' me watchin' him. What? Take a look. Let me see. Hey, we got company. Federal agents. Everybody stay right where you are. Back it down, slim. Miami Vice. Miami Vice. Ech. Uh, listen, I wouldn't go pokin' around back there, bub. Right. What are you doing here? - Stakeout. What are you doin' here? - Who are you staking out? Tony Amato. Hey! There's a damn alligator back there! He's as big as a house! Honest, Nick, he's as big as a house. He's really back there. Honest, Nick. - We're here to take over your operation. We're in place. You're not. That's easily changed. We can have your bugs cleaned out and ours installed by tomorrow. Look, you guys are out of your league on this. What we are is "here." What we're not is "leaving." Be with that and we can all get what we want, namely, Tony Amato. Or you can start playing games and you'll flush him. And then we'll all get exactly what you little boys in Washington generally shoot at, nothin'. All right, we'll piggyback your bugs, but our mission takes precedence. Maybe, maybe not. Just what is your mission, Mr. Phelps? A national armory was busted into. Big score. Tony Amato is about to deal the weapons. M-60 machine guns? - That's not our major concern. Well, it would be if you had one of 'em trying to tattoo "Mother" on your chest. What is? - A crate of stingers. You talkin' about ground-to-air stingers?  You got it. Missiles? Guided missiles? What did these guys do, back up a semi? Oh, no, no, no. These are small, hand-held, about...about this big. Weigh about thirty pounds. Put one on your shoulder, aim, press the trigger and bingo. They have a range of what? Three and a half miles. A guidance system sophisticated enough to knock out an F-15. This is what we're really scared of... A commercial jetliner. You want Tony Amato? You want him? All right, we'll dance. We want the missiles. Mclntyre stays here with you. Um, with the alligator, Nick? Looks like Tony and his lady are goin' to a party. So, where in the hell do you think you're going in this? All your taste is in your mouth. You are so stupid, you can't even dress yourself! It said formal! Formal! This guy's a real sweetheart. This is a formal. You get in there! Change! What do you want me to wear? What do I care? Whatever you wear, you're gonna button it wrong! Why don't you just go without me? Hey, you want somethin' to wear? - Wear this! Now, you're goin'! Now, you get dressed! Sounds like he's killin' her. What's he doin'? He pushed her into the pool. This guy's scum. Let me take a look. You will get dried off. You'll get dressed. And you will go with me. I am sick and tired of waiting for you. Divorce me or... Will not happen. Send me...I can't... That will never, ever happen! I didn't become a cop to spectate. Let's nail this pig. I want you to go to the airport tomorrow morning. Got a guy comin' in from Jamaica. "Toussan," "Toussant," "DuPass"... Something like that. Do you know what he looks like? No, I never met him. He's gonna look for the Maserati at the baggage area. Come on, let's get out of here. What about Mrs. Amato? Hell with her. All that, then he leaves her anyway. What a joke. Hello? Rita? Rita. Oh, God. Rita, what is it? I can't take it anymore. He never stops. It's... Do you want me to arrange the meeting? Rita. Oh, he'll know. He won't. He will. He always knows everything. Rita, there's no other way. You've tried them all. Rita... I'm scared. I don't know how you've lasted this long. I better go. Do you want me to set up a meeting? Rita? Yes. Okay. I'll set it up. What was that all about? Offhand, I'd say Rita just made a decision to have her husband killed. I better go. Do you want me to set up a meeting? Gentlemen, gentlemen, listen to the tape again. She's going to ice him. I don't make that correlation. And we don't have any more time for your passion plays, Detective. Our priority is to get those missiles back. We're not gonna just stand around and let some citizen get shot, even if he is lower than dirt. Look, if she takes him out, it blows us all out of the water. I'm willing to take the chance that that is not going to happen. You've got Tony Amato under a lot of eyes. He's safer now than he's ever been. DuPass is arriving today. Amato has never seen him. We're in an ideal position to move to the next step. We're gonna pick up DuPass at the airport and replace him with Paul. Paul, how long you been doing undercover? I've done some assignments along the way. Yeah, and I'll bet you took drama in high school. No offense, Paul, but I think we'll handle this. You the man or the driver? Just a little domestic help, pal. Jump in. Yeah? - Is this Jimmy Yureka? Who wants to know? I was given your name by a mutual friend. She said I might be able to meet you somewhere. There's a park on Fulton Street. I know the one. Be at the southeast corner in an hour. Beat it. You lookin' for me? I don't think I can go through with this. Your choice. My choice? My choice. If only I had a choice, but I don't. He does. You can leave him. Don't you think I've tried? Lady, I only know what you tell me. Well, I tried. I ran away. He found me and brought me back. I went to the police. They said to get a lawyer. Last month I got a lawyer. I told him I didn't want Tony's money. I just wanted out. Tony tried to buy the lawyer off, but he couldn't. The lawyer said I had a right to leave if I wanted to, and I had a right to hire a lawyer. Tony says, "Is that so?" Then he hires these two animals, and they follow the lawyer's wife until she's alone. Then they get her. When they were through with her, they told her to tell her husband... that if he didn't mind his own business, their daughter would be next. Their daughter. And he would. Tony could do that. I should never have gone to that lawyer. What happened to his wife was my fault. Your fault? - He didn't know what Tony was like. But I did. I have no place to turn, and I can't take it anymore. I can't. So you want me to kill him? I thought I did. But now you don't? I wish him dead every day, every minute for what he's done. But not his way. I can't do it this way. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. I'm not who you think I am. I'm a cop. I want you to listen to me very carefully, Rita. We have your house bugged. There's a listening device in every room, and taps on the phone. You know, Tony's in big trouble. The federal government wants him. We want him. And we're gonna get him. You don't know him. Oh, yes, we do. He's killed people. I know that. He's smart. He's so smart. We know he's smart, and we know he's tough. But he's not smart enough for all of us. We can put him away, Rita, but we need your help. We need you to go back home. If you don't, Tony will get suspicious. He might discover the house is bugged. He'll know we're on to him. And we'll lose him. A couple of days. That's all. And then we'll put him away where he can't bother you anymore. We'll be right there every minute. Can you do that, Rita? Can you buy us some time? Okay. We haven't heard from everyone on this one. There's got to be someone else waiting in the wings in Washington. This little demonstration you wanted is costing me a lot of money. Hey, Tony. Hey, you're pretty smart to check this out, man. I mean, they have had a bad rep, but that's all been worked out, man. They got a new guidance system now. Better to be safe than sorry. So, you're an expert on this weapon, man? Hey, man, I mean to tell ya. Good old Uncle Sam spent every bit of six months... teachin' me all there was to know, man. You talkin' army? - No, man. National Guard. You're killin' us. Say, Tony, how about us lettin' one of these birds fly, man? Mmm. Okay, the number at the top is the target distance. The readout at the bottom is the firing sequence. That's very complicated, man. Oh, no, man. Any knucklehead with a G.E.D. can light one up. Okay, now, to turn on the tracking system, all you have to do is flip this here. Wait a minute, man. This thing not gonna go off, is it? No, man, not until we tell it to. Okay, now hold it steady. See this switch here? Yeah, man. Okay, push that forward with your thumb. Okay, hold that there. Okay, now that specific image is locked into the computer tracking system. The missile will seek out that target and that target only. And as it gets within striking range, the heat seeker automatically integrates with the base system, and the missile homes in. Hmm. - Now, here's another little twist that a lot of people don't know nothin' about. What's that? Armin' the warhead is optional. Yeah? Yeah. I don't understand. Let's say your target is a commercial plane, and you want to make it look like it crashed accidentally. Yeah. Well, you just flip this little switch, and the missile goes right up the wing, probably ripping the wing off the airplane, and down she goes. But no explosion. Makes it look like it just crashed accidentally, man, like engine failure. Just that pure and simple. Let me get this straight now. I take this, and I shoot the airplane. Uh-huh. And either it explodes or not, but it still knocks the plane down. Right! Yeah, it'll hit like a great big bullet. But, hey, talk's cheap, right? That's what we're here for, to pop the cap on this baby. Gentle, here she comes. All right. Okay. Come here. How many missiles we talkin' about? Ten. Nine now. Can you get more? No, man. Gettin' them was just a fluke. The sarge had left me and Ramone here to guard the armory while he went out to get pizza. So, I called my boys over, and we picked up a few of them, and a couple of M-60s, and then they booked up. Gentle, Gentle, easy with the details, all right? Oh, yeah, man. I'm sorry. The price is $75,000 each, as we discussed. Yeah, man. Are we just talking here or what? We're talkin'. But I'll take all the inventory. Hey, man, that's what we want to hear. Right, Ramone? After I inspect the merchandise, then we'll talk about delivery. I don't deliver. Well, then the 75 ain't 75. Sixty-five if I have to handle transport. We're talkin' about port of entry, man. Sixty-seven, five, and you got a deal. Cool. Hey. Good. What do you say we get some chow? No, thanks. I have other commitments. When do we finish our business? When do I see the inventory? Tomorrow. That's when we finish our business. Good. Good night. That one's dead, man.

This is gonna be like a nice little vacation. Not today, buddy. You think not, huh? I have a court order for the release of Tony Amato. Release? He hasn't even been charged. And he won't be. Amato is useful to us. No outside intervention, huh? We were about to arraign Amato when they showed up. I don't like this any more than you do. Who are you? F. B. I.? C. I.A.? What difference does it make? What is this scum to you? Amato leads us to certain factions. Look, we're not here to play 20 questions. We're here for Amato. Release him. He's their end of a conduit. Through him, certain factions in Central and South America... are supplied without embarrassing us. "Supplied"? Guys like DuPass? Yeah. Give me the key. - Lieutenant... The lieutenant's been here before. He knows how it goes. I tried to tell you, fellas. I got the juice. Rita. - You're letting him go. Rita? No!
