 The department's not my private detective agency. We follow procedures in Vice. Following procedure? That's not what you're doin', Lieutenant. Come on, Lieutenant. You've gone to bat for us plenty of times. If this Lao Li family is responsible for moving a third of the smack out of Southeast Asia... and he's here, then he's our business. And if your lady's part of his orbit, she's our business too. Por favor, Martin, let us in. Let's find Lao Li. He had to be brought in by someone. Who? - Look up a Dale Menton. M-E-N-T-O-N. He was Lao Li's rabbi for the Company. All right. Hey. Call next time. You got it, Lieutenant. They list him as retired. You never get out of the Company. He now runs a security consulting... With one client... Lao Li. His consultancy have an address? Washington, D.C., P.O. box. A blind. An agent never gets out of the Company. The Company would know where he is. They don't even talk to themselves, let alone us. His consultancies may be a blind, but his home address sure isn't. I got it right here. How the hell'd you find it? My extraordinary skill... The telephone book. Why isn't Menton undercover? Breakfast, shoeshine, cleaners and now this. How much more you wanna tail this guy Menton? No more. Let's go. Don't even try it! What the hell is this? Save the floor show, sweetheart. Get dressed. You're goin' with us. You tellin' me I'm under arrest? We're tellin' you you're leavin'. You can make this hard or easy. It don't matter to me, pal. You got a permit for this? - As a matter of fact, I do. Show it to me later. Welcome to Miami. Is that what you interrupted my morning massage to tell me? Been a long time, Castillo. Do you have somethin' to say, or, uh, do I pick up my key to the city, say thank you and boogie on outta here? We have business. Not anymore we don't. Yes, we do. Two pieces of business. One... The ambush in the pass north of Mae Sa. Who ratted my team out? - Castillo, your problem was you never knew when to back off. You D.E.A. bozos wanted to interdict opium at the source. Fine. Interdict anybody's opium you want. But we told you, "Do not interdict Lao Li's opium." 'Cause his junk was financed by politicians in Bangkok. 'Cause we needed to keep them clowns happy. But, no, not you. You're by-the-book, on the straight and narrow... and willing to compromise our political interests... just to knock over a little bit of number three. Little bit of number three. There were two and a half tons coming out of the Shan Mountains... to be refined into heroin of number three opium. The men your agency sponsored were responsible for hundreds of lives... Don't start singin' that song to me, 'cause I don't give a damn... how many junkies end up dying in Detroit with a needle stickin' in their arm. If they didn't score Lao Li's, they'd score Turkish smack, Mexican brown... One kind of smack or another kind of smack. And what the hell difference does it make? What does make a difference... is the opium your people busted caused political problems for us in Thailand. And in case you ain't boned up on recent history lately, that happens to be the last piece of real estate... we got access to in that part of the world. You wanna know who ratted you out? I did! I ratted you out, you arrogant bastard. You set up to ambush the caravan. I gave 'em your position, your strength, and they hit you from the back! Lieutenant! - Marty. Lieutenant! - Let him go. Now, was there somethin' else, Lieutenant? 'Cause I'm late for a business luncheon. Where is she? Here in Miami. Is she a hostage? Who, your wife? You want me to give up Lao Li, so you can force him to give you your wife? Where have you put Lao Li? Where's he stashed? Where's he stashed? You wanna know where he's hiding? Nowhere. Fact of the matter is he's waiting for you to give him a call. Castillo, nobody's hiding from you. Nobody's running away from you. Because as far as everyone's concerned, you're not a threat anymore. You're nothin' anymore. There's his number. Give him a call. Get outta here. Loyalty. I like that. Bye, Castillo. What was that all about... The ambush? I was in the Golden Triangle. One of the opium producers I was trying to stop... was a Class-A violator... General Lao Li. I'll get in the back. Opium is his sole cash crop. A couple of times a year, Lao Li and the others would bring the crop out in mule trains. I set up an ambush, but they knew we were comin'. Most of my people got killed. A man I'd worked with for three years died in my arms. I was wounded. When they didn't find my body, they grenaded my house in Mae Sa. May Ying and I were in love. I was told she died. I left Thailand. That was five years ago. And that guy Menton, he gave you up? Yes. - He was Company. You were working for the D.E.A.... - Both American agencies. - With different objectives. Man, it's nuts. - No, it's not. It's Southeast Asia. Let's go. Still the policeman. I want you out of Miami. Yes, I expect you do, but I'm not leaving. I'm here to retire. Isn't that why people come to Miami? You're not here to retire. Sorry, but I am. I have made good in the commodities trade. Made investments. That's what you call it... commodities? Castillo, you don't seem to understand the reality of commodities. In the global market, uh, opium is no different from tapioca... or tin ore from Malaysia. It is simply a...a product for which there is a demand. You see the world through a narrow, moralistic perspective. That is why you will always be a local policeman. And that is why I can move 28 people, have trust accounts in more countries than you have fingers and toes... and why I am able to come into your city when I want to, under the protection of one of your federal agencies, and you can't do a thing about it. And if someone should steal my hubcaps, I'll demand that your little police department... find them and bring them back. I have committed no crimes in your city, and I will commit no crimes in your city. I am here, Castillo, to become an honored citizen. Where's May Ying? You'll find her at that address. Does she know I'm here? - No. You brought her here to use as a hostage. I brought her here out of benevolence. So that I wouldn't come for you out of fear you'd harm her. I intend harm to no one. It is against the law. I don't believe you. What you believe and don't believe is your problem, isn't it? A man in this city... He is known to some of you. He can be a very dangerous adversary. He will be watching us. You will maintain absolute conformity to all laws. He will seize any opportunity to cause us difficulty. It is very, very important... no one violate laws. In time, he will lose interest. But for now, you must be very, very careful. Oh! I thought you had been killed. I never would have left. Never. He's my son. I'm married now. After a time, I started living again. Is that when you married? His name is Ma Sek. Do you love him? Yes. I found you only to lose you all over again. But I'm glad you're happy. We would have been happy too, Martin. Why Miami? A textile company offered him a job if we'd come right away. I loved you. I truly loved you. Right now, that's a long time ago and far away. And you? Your life good? Fine. My life is fine. Something isn't right. You okay? Yeah, fine. Just fine. What's gonna happen? She has a child. She has a husband. She has her own life now. Take me back to the office. We got a lot to do. All right. When'd you get in? Last week. We still talkin' 50 kilos? $44,000 a key... Delivered in Miami. When's it comin' in? We got a sample in a couple of days. The rest in a week. Will I see footprints? Howie, this is us. Direct from the source to you. It's been stepped on zero times. Ninety-two percent pure. It's chess. He's blocked me from making a move on him by bringing her here. He's saying that the woman I loved... was dead... is alive. And, as he brought her here, he can send her away and kill her anytime he wants. And would he? - Without hesitation. So, what do we do? I want a tail on the family members. I want to know everybody they come in contact with. If they sit next to a guy in the movies, I want a make run on him. If a Lao family member even jaywalks, I wanna know about it. If we're all over 'em like that, what happens to May Ying? I'll take care of her. How extensive is Castillo's surveillance? Extensive. But there's nothin' to worry about because there's nothin' to surveil. A quiet family goin' about their business. End of story. Oh, except your nieces. - What are they doing? Your nieces are shopping at expensive stores. You know, jewelry, clothing... Things like that. Some of these stores are owned and operated by people... that are using them to launder money. So, please, if you could tell them to take it easy? I will speak to them. Thank you. Hey. There they are. Hey, Dave. Check this out. You got it? Uh, just about. You're gonna love this. Okay. Give it a try. ♪♪ Isn't that great? Yeah, it's great. It's not too smart. Take it off. This kind of thing only attracts attention. This is Miami, not Hong Kong. This is not your playground. What do you wanna do, cause problems for your grandfather? Do you understand? Take it off. ♪♪ We're shootin' blanks, Lieutenant. The old man spends every day just slappin' mah-jongg tiles with a bunch of other old dudes. The girls are buying up the town. - Not making any moves on the street. I can't justify spending everybody's time on Lao Li's case like this. However long it takes, Lieutenant. Absolutely. No. We'll give it another 24 hours. If nothing comes up, the ladies go back to Castleobronco case. Gentlemen, you're back on Lombard and his bookies. What about General Lao Li? I'll handle Lao Li myself. Are we, uh, talkin' vigilante time here, Lieutenant? You got a career and a life here. In the time I've spent here, I think... you people know me better than that. I have a thousand reasons to play O.K. Corral with Lao Li and Menton. But I'm a policeman. I enforce the law... Equally applied, no special cases. Maybe it sounds naive, but it's all I've got. It's what I believe in, and it's who I am. Then what are we talking about? A leave of absence... till I can build a case against Lao Li. ♪♪ ♪ She comes on like a rose ♪ ♪ But everybody knows ♪ ♪♪ Mama, you are outrageous! You are contagious! Admit me. Admit me to your intensive care! Transfuse me. Abuse me. Oh, baby, baby! Not the Noogiescope! Where is my organ donor card when I need it? Mama, come here! ♪♪ Hey! Hey, Noogie. We got to talk. Give me that back. You hear about some Asians movin' into Miami? Oh, what's up, baby? When we all gonna get married? What you mean, Asians? You mean, like, the boat people? We hear they might be movin' some dope. Dope? What you mean? Like rope-a-dope? Scoop-a-dope? Yippity-dippity... As in opium. As in China white. As in heroin. Be cool. We can't discuss this here. In other words, you don't know. Well, where these people hang out? That's what we wanna know. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get my shirts done, go into the laundry... and see if I can get some information for ya. How's that? Look, you better get somethin' goin'', sweet pea, or you gonna be a taxpayer like the rest of us. Baby, that never exists for the Noogman. But if I get some info, I'll drop a quarter, okay? In the meanwhile, can you lend me a dollar to give this woman?

Pretty good. Excuse me, but are you fully protected... from the dangers of insect ravagement? If not... and who is?... we'd like to offer you a free inspection. That's right, because you can never be too safe... down here in South "Flor-eye-da." What, with all these warm... trouble spots? Do you wanna eat, or what? Hmm. Four double cheeseburgers. You got it. Yabba-dabba-dooya. Love to sock it to ya. You keep in touch, baby doll. Hey! If it ain't Yogi and Boo-Boo come to fill their picnic basket. I been checkin' all the channels for you fellas. What, y'all been on station break? Everybody's on the street, Noogie. We got a real urgent situation. Yeah. Some other time, homeboy. Hey, man, don't boogie on the Noogie. Hear the news before you cruise. You know? Street's been hummin' about a flood that's comin'. China white at a price that's right. - China white? From where? Oh! Oh, man! All of a sudden, I'm too weak to speak. But of course, it you turn me on to some calories, I'll see if I can get behind some conversation. Feed us first, Noogie. - Who's the source? Huh. From the big man to the middleman, and the middleman is the riddle man, you know? Who's the source? Hey, take it easy, man! The dude's name is Howie Wong. Well, guess whose car. I guess Lao Li's grandsons are going into business. Well, the Noogman came through. Yeah. Let's get him a solid-gold egg roll. Exquisite. I love the formalities. Tradition still has its place. See you tonight. The sample's yours. Well, in that case, I'll throw in a few wontons. ♪♪ Hey, what can I do for you? - You Howie Wong? Yeah. How'd you know? Most people mistake me for Robert Redford. He's shorter. - Hah! Hey, what would you guys like? - We'd like one Howie Wong... to go. How do you know Wong? I drained him a couple of years ago on a counterfeit rap. He was on probation to boot. Lieutenant, it's about the... Hey, guys. This is Howie Wong. Say hi to the guys, Howie. Hello, Howie. How are you, babe? How's the restaurant business? I hear it's gettin' a little hot in the kitchen. Howie's got a hell of an interesting story, Lieutenant, and he's real anxious to tell it. Isn't that right, Howie? - Bring him in the room. Come with me, sweetheart. Not bad. It's good of you. The produce truck is due to arrive at 2:00 a.m. We'll be double-and triple-teamed at all points. There'll be units for every window, door, fire escape... every possible exit way. Both exits covered? Yeah, Lieutenant. Alley comin' and goin'. I think we got it buttoned up, Lieutenant. It's open. It's comin' down. Let's do it. Miami Vice! Nobody move! Freeze! On your knees. Bite the asphalt! Down! Hands behind your head! Wally. Your two grandsons have been arrested. They were apprehended in the act of trying to sell 50 kilos of heroin. This is the reason you came here... To tell me this? I thought you'd want to know. How many you got guardin' the house? Six. Two in front, two on backyards, one on each end of the street. Van's a block away. All right. From right now on, no one goes in or out of the house. Yeehaw! Wait a minute, sweetheart. Didn’t you forget something? I don't believe it. Dale. You really are a "company" man, Menton. Well, Dale, while you were up here frolicking, two of your associates got popped. Yes, sir, for trafficking in narcotics. Two youngbloods... Global playboy types. White Lamborghini. - What's that got to do with me? Get the hell outta here. What's that got to do with you? Where you been, pal? You been out of the country too long, or what? Haven’t you heard of the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1984? Surely you're aware of the RICO statutes. See, what we're gonna do, buddy... Is we're gonna associate you to these two guys and their little drug deal, you see. And then we're gonna show receipt of I.G.G.... Ill-gotten gains. And then guess what? We're gonna start confiscating... All your assets. Yes, sir. You can just kiss all this good-bye... and anything else you've gotten and stashed away over 20 years with Lao Li. Nice talkin' to ya. Don't sweat it, man. With food stamps, Medicare, and your government pension, everything will be all right. Do you know a man named Lao Li? No. Isn't he someone you worked against years ago? Yes. You were offered a job and brought here by Consolidated Textiles, a subsidiary of the Asian Trading Corporation... A Panamanian company run by Lao Li. What you don't know is that you were brought here to be a hostage. We've seen no men. No threats have been made. He's better than that. He knows that I know that he can reach out and kill you anytime he wants... Here or out of the country... And he can. So your physical presence is enough. But why does he think a threat to us will keep him safe from you? Because he knows how much I care for your wife. There will be some men outside that work for me. They will protect you. You must do exactly what they say. What will you do about Lao Li? I can't tell you that. Lieutenant, I entered the "no bail" motion. Because of who the kids are, I think we'll get it. We'll know in about a half an hour. Don't enter a "no bail" motion. - What? Aren't you gonna use those two for leverage against Lao Li? No. Retract the motion. Sure. Lieutenant. That's puttin' 'em right back out on the street. That's right. - Why? That's where I want 'em. Give 'em plenty of room, but don't lose 'em. We also have two parallel tails. Okay, let's go. You have threatened the security of everything we have here. Why? This has nothing to do with you! Hmm. They can make you say that I am involved, that you were working for me. We won't talk, Grandfather. You have compromised me. You have compromised the whole security of this family. What do you have to say? Who the hell are you to preach to us, old man? You made your fortune. You built your dynasty. It's our generation's turn. Why can't we create our own? Huh? Tell me! You speak to me this way? You are rebellious because you've broken your filial obligations to me. Therefore, my paternal benevolence towards you ends right now. Take them. Kill them. Take them. Kill them. Hey, Lieutenant Castillo, I got it. Freeze! A quick call to Washington, Castillo. Wrong! You broke the law. This is Miami, Menton, not Asia. General Lao Li, you're under arrest... for the attempted murder of your two grandsons, conspiracy to commit a felony, felonious assault. You knew I would go to any length to not break the law. Including attempting to commit murder. Old enemies come to know one another very well over the years, and there comes regard... even for an adversary. Really? Yes. Maybe our relationship will continue. The adversarial part? We are grateful for your help. I wish things had worked out for you here. I'm sorry that they didn't. And I'm sorry for those things that haven't worked out for you. We wish you good fortune, Lieutenant. Thank you. Hey, Lieutenant. We know this old bar in the Keys. In the months we've worked together, have you ever heard me say I need a drink? Uh-uh. Good. Take me to a bar.
