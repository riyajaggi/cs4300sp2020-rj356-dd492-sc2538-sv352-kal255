Very nice. ¿Cómo estás, Roberto? ¿Es tuya? - All the most beautiful girls in Miami are mine, Roberto. She's not available at the moment. Soon. $5, 000. Carísima. It's a lot of money. You're a man of peculiar habits. She's virgin territory, Roberto. You think about it. What's the problem? Mr. Suskaway's a good client. I'm not interested. You're paid to be interested. ♪♪ ♪ Here's a real solution ♪ There's someone I want you to meet. Excuse me. ♪♪ Diane Gordon, David Traynor. Your host, my boss. Enjoying yourself? Yeah. I love it. It's so radical. Well, I'm glad you came. Thanks. I need a refill. Anyone else? Please. You're very pretty. Thanks. I don't know if Lile told you, Diane. I run a modeling agency here in Miami. It's not Madison Avenue, but we do all right. Really? Yeah. And of course, we're always looking for fresh new talent. Diane, would it startle you if I told you you could earn... $10,000 a month? Yeah? Identification? Not yet. But she was a floater. She had to be in the water at least eight hours. There doesn't appear to be any puncture wounds. No trauma. Could have been a suicide. Hold it. Ray. What's happening? What? Is it workin'? I'm making adjustments. What? I'm making adjustments! This thing just has to be... looks like it has to be turned a couple times here. What? Okay, try it now. How's that? No. Nothin'. Maybe it needs some oil. Maybe it needs some pollen. Okay, try it now. How's that? Nothin'. Whoa. - What? Ah, I'll do it myself. You can't fix anything. Technical difficulties, guys? Nah, we're just working some of the bugs out of the system. Uh-huh. Some blue-chip hooker turned up face down in the Miami River this morning. Castillo wants to shake out the Traynor organization, see what falls out. Gina got a line on a very private party. We're gonna give 'em a buzz. Maybe it's a short circuit. Maybe it's possessed. I don't know. There's somethin' scary about the concept of Switek and Zito... doin' roach removal... Like it's a conflict of interest or something. Sounds like you've covered all the bases. Lieutenant, we can keep our eyes and ears open, put the word out on the streets. Well, I appreciate your help. Valerie? Hello, Ricardo. How long you been in town? Uh, two weeks. Is there some place we... Where we can go and talk? Excuse me. Um, we know each other. My sister just graduated from school, and she couldn't find a job. So she and a couple of friends hopped in a car and blew out of Brooklyn. The novelty wore off after about a...a month. She called me from Chicago. I sent her some money. And then another month went by, her friends came back without her. They said one day she went out for a walk and just never came back. I've spent six months... using every resource available to a Brooklyn police detective to try and track her down. I followed the trail here. You mean you've been in Miami for two weeks... I've filed a missing persons report. And you didn't call me? I've checked every local agency, Every support group, runaway hotline. The morgue. How come you didn't call me, woman? I was a little preoccupied. I could've helped. I didn't wanna bother you. Oh, come on, Val. You know me better than that. No, I don't. We didn't exactly part on the best of terms. Besides, I would've gotten nowhere that much faster. She's not here, Rico. She's not here in Miami. Maybe... Maybe you haven't looked in all the right places. Now you know me better than that. Then we'll try again. ♪♪ Yes? Emergency exterminators. What? Yep. Open your mouth. Come on. Ooh. Ooh. Better late than never. Yeah, we'll get those buggers. Uh, excuse me. There's no reason to panic. This won't take but just a second, so work with us. How you doin'? Good. Ooh. Gotta watch out for the spiders. - Lot of fun, isn't it? We gotta get this tree real good here. Hi, kids. I wouldn't drink anything after this if I were you. There we go. Watch out. I never like comin' back to a place a second time, you know. Bugs, bugs, bugs. Watch out. We'll give 'em the juice. - Can we get high on this? Huh? Come on, Gary. Let's get goin'. Got a lot of house here. - Okay, Jake. You know, I have a dress just like that at home. Beautiful. Very, very nice. Very nice. Watch out here now. Watch out. They're everywhere. The smell goes away in a couple hours. Nice dress. Really enjoy it. Really do. Having fun? Good. Don't drive now. Can I help you guys? Hey! You're infested with a six-legged plague here, pal. I mean, you got your ants, your silverfish, your earwigs, your praying mantises, your tropical termites... You're leavin'! Hey, we get paid either way. Now! Leave! Now! Now! Now! Isn't this a lot of fun? Nice suit. You'll thank us later. I'll go back to New York. Maybe I'll find another lead on her. I've taken enough time here as it is. I know the territory, Ricardo. There are a lot of places Diane can hide, and I could spend the rest of my life looking. She's old enough to know what she's doing. Yeah? Yeah. Well, she's not. I've raised her since she was eight years old. It's hard to let go. You know, seeing you... again... Please. Please. After all this time... and everything we went through before, you know, it's kind of weird. Yeah. I... I know. It's that thing that wouldn't die. Magic. We were younger. Yeah. We were so... obsessed with our careers. It just wouldn't work. We...We were going in different directions. We kept tripping over each other. Yeah, well, it seems like it's... come back around again. I think I want you to stay. Good. 'Cause I wasn't plannin' on leaving. Great job, Stan. Here's where, uh, Stanley's gonna really show his auteur stuff. Yeah, we're thinking of releasing it for the drive-in market. I want everyone identified. Maybe one of these people will connect us directly to Traynor. Yeah. Right before hell freezes over. We don't have any leverage. And those guys probably all have built-in diplomatic immunity. Do it. Tubbs abandon ya? No, he's downstairs. What time's your flight? Noon. I'm just sittin' here killing time. Sheila. Crockett. Pull the file on Taranova, will ya? Thanks. You like bad movies? Switek and Zito are screening their latest musical comedy. What's it called? Inadmissible Evidence. Stop the tape. Isn't that Roberto Marquez with her? Do you recognize her? Yeah.

And your name is, please? - Mr. Miami Vice. Where do you think you're going? Hello. You can't go in there. You have no jurisdiction in here. We don't need jurisdiction. Listen. He has the nerves. Mr. Miami Vice, I told you. You can't go in there. You have no jurisdiction. Hands off the threads, toots. Go get a cup of coffee, will ya? What do you think you're doing? Just looking for a little information, Senor Marquez. Senor Marquez, I tried to tell them, but they insisted. So? You have pictures of me and pretty girls. High-priced call girls. If you are the police, you know I have diplomatic immunity. If this is blackmail, you have failed. In my country, prostitution is a very ordinary thing. What you're doin' in those photographs isn't ordinary anywhere, pal. My conscience is clean. Look, we're not here to harass you. We just would like to know where to find this girl. They don't give out home phone numbers. Do you know where she is? Please go away. I cannot help you. I'm sorry. Senor Marquez. You see, it's like this. The girl in the photographs... The one that likes to do the things that you like to do... The girl you're trying to protect... That's my baby sister. This man. This is your connection. Call him. Tell him you've got a couple of high rollers that love to party. You're asking so much. There's trust involved. The value of my given word. Got it? You feel like shopping today? I asked you something first. Well, you don't really need it. Well... Course I don't need it. But I want it. 'Cause I like it. I really don't need you either, but I still want you. Don't try to con me. I'm not a client. I wasn't trying to con you. I wasn't. I wasn't. I mean it. Here. Go ahead. Take it. No. You don't really need me at all. Not very large, but acceptable. Tubbs, people in stucco houses should not throw quiche. ♪♪ Hello. Do I know you? Burnett and Cooper. Oh. I'm glad you could make it. Friends of Roberto's. The bar's straight out there. Everything's self-serve. Very nice. Mingle, my friends. Thank you. My goodness. Enough loins in here to stock a meat locker. That's true too, you know? Well, how you wanna do this? Tandem or solo? Solo. Cover more territory. Catch you at the pass. ♪♪ Hi. ♪ Do I need you now ♪ ♪ For a moment ♪ Got a light? Sure. ♪ Come on, come on, come on Take me down for a while ♪ ♪♪ Thanks. Can I get you anything? Jumper cables. For my heart. I see her. ♪ Well, hold me till the end, honey ♪ Uh... I don't think so. Uh, you see, I got a trick knee. Every time somebody asks me that, it goes out on me. Hi, Diane. ♪ Do I need you now ♪ ♪ For a moment ♪ Remember me? I'm a friend of your sister's. ♪ Come on Take me down for a while♪♪ From New York? Yeah. What are you doing here? I came to take you home. I don't want to go home. I'm a Vice detective, Diane. There's another one waiting outside. All you have to do is walk back in there with me, and we'll get you out of here. Listen, I told you. I don't want to go home. So, uh, why don't you just... get on back up the road, Mr. Tubbs? Come on, Diane. I told you I don't wanna go home! Shh! Let go of me! I don't wanna go home! I don't wanna go home! Please! You have no right! Hey, hey. Let her go, friend. I think my friend and I are gonna call it a night. Get the door for us. Wait! I don't wanna go home! That's it. That's it. Let go of me! Good night. I don't want to go home! Let go of me! Stop it! I don't want to go home! Hurry. Get her in there. Be careful. Watch her head. Let go of me! Let me out! I don't wanna go home! Get away! Get away from me! I don't wanna go! Get away! Diane! Stop. Let me out! Don't. Diane. You get away from me! Get away! Stop it! Stop it! I don't want to go home! You've ruined everything! You always ruin everything! I don't! I love you. Ruined everything! I hate you! Hi. How you doin'? How long have you been here? Not too long. Can I get you something? Do you need anything? Yes. The nurse... To get you out of here. Diane, I want to know what happened to you. What happened? I've been looking for you for six months. Okay. I'll tell you what happened. Everything. Clothes, jewelry, credit cards. I make a thousand dollars a night. You're really living it up, huh? Damn right. My life is one solid party. I wanna tell you something, Di. I'm through taking care of you. You're too old, and I'm too tired. Good. And you can stop trying to pull that guilt trip on me. There's no reason for you to be on a guilt trip... just because I'm having a gas. Oh, I didn't know being used was so much fun. Nobody uses me. They buy and sell you seven nights a week. I don't do anything I don't want to. You're a grown woman now. You can do whatever you want. But I just want to let you know that I care about you. And I'm there if you need me, okay? You mean it? I mean it. For real? For real. Can't we ever help somebody without expecting them to return the favor? Diane is the whole damn case, pal. Without her, we got nothin'. Diane is one girl. We dealt her a second chance. And I think that's a hell of an accomplishment. But we bury Traynor, and there's another sleazeball to take his position... within a week. And another and another. It's an endless proposition. I don't care about another sleazeball. Our job is to bust Traynor. One little deposition. A deposition. Sure. And then Traynor challenges it. They put her on the stand, cut her open, and spill everything out for public inspection. You want to see her go through that and risk the possibility of Traynor getting away? I don't think it's worth it. What do you think, Detective? I think she's been used enough. We'll find another way. Hi. It's Diane. Diane, I've missed you. Listen. I've been doing some thinking. And I think that I've decided to go back to New York. Is something wrong? No. No, everything's fine. I've just think... Been thinking about some things, and that's what I want to do. Well, if that's what you want to do, you know what? What? I think that's what you should do. I wanted to thank you for all the nice things that you did for me. No. You don't have to thank me. But, uh, I would like to see you before you go. Where are you? Mm-hmm. 'Cause you can't blame me if I try to change your mind. Well, if that's the case, I...I think I'd better say good-bye over the phone. But I am gonna miss you. Ciao, baby. Those cops get to her? She says she's on her way back to New York. You believe it? Sure. By way of the D.A.'s office. And I take a third fall on five felony counts. Take care of her. I think I'm gonna stay here until Diane gets better. Mmm. Yeah, well, you could stay with me. Yeah. I was thinking about that too. ♪ Gotta take a little time ♪ And what about your job? Well, I've been on a leave of absence. I could extend it. Or... maybe I'll just call it a day. I've been on homicide for five years, and it's become such a treadmill. I just need to be near Diane.

Including two of your own Vice detectives, Lieutenant. Did you know Diane Gordon? Yes. Obviously, or I wouldn't be here, would I? Where did you meet her? I met her at a cocktail party. She came with one of the other guests. When I learned that she was new to Miami and alone, I...I offered her a place to stay until she got settled. How long before you turned her out? Lieutenant Castillo. Tubbs. - - She mentioned she was interested in modeling. I run an agency. I thought I could help her. Did you? No. Much to my regret, she moved on after a couple of days. Uh, I did offer to set up a photo session, but she didn't seem interested. So I didn't press. There are many, many other pretty girls in Miami. And how many of those pretty girls can you say you’ve murdered? Lieutenant, I'm gonna have to ask you to get Detective Tubbs out of here... if he persists on harassing my client. Did you seduce her with the coke, or was it just that she used it to forget... when she realized what you had turned her into? Lieutenant Castillo, unless you're planning to press charges... No. Mr. Traynor is free to leave. We appreciate his cooperation. Thank you. I'm not through with you. You better stay clean, because if you don't, I'm gonna be on you like a bad rash...just waiting. She was a beautiful girl, and it's a tragedy. No, Rico! I don't want him unless you can keep him. Take it easy. - You've opened yourselves up to libel and assault. Get him out of here. I don't ever want to see you do anything like this again. By the book, Rico. By the book. No mistakes. Solid cop work. I don't want Traynor off on a technicality. All right. We'll do it by the book. No. Not we. You. I'm gonna take my sister home. Is there anyone meeting you at Kennedy? Yeah. My girlfriend Billi. You're all set. They're boarding now. I'll say good-bye now. Take care, Sonny. If there's anything you need, if there's anything I can do... Thanks. Listen, Valerie. I want you to come back. I know. I'm thinking I might. Uh... But I...I think the best thing for me to do right now... is to go back to work for a while... and, uh, tie up some loose ends. I don't know. You're sure you don't want me to go back with you? Yes. Rico, I just need some time. All I want to do is get on this plane and close my eyes and not talk to anyone. Call me when you get home. You can call me every day if you want to. If you need someone just to talk to or... lean on or anything. I'll be all right. I know you will. I love you, Rico. I love you too. Remember that always, okay? Sonny. We finally identified that girl we found floating in the river. I think that's where we should concentrate our efforts. Right. Uh, Cathy, send this to Central. Was it one of Traynor's? Gina and Trudy are trying to find that out. What about Switek and Zito's movie? We made a list of names. You and Tubbs want to split it with them? Yeah. How's he doing? He'll be all right. We gotta fly. I just got a call from Valerie's friend Billi in New York. She said that Diane's casket arrived, but Valerie didn't. She didn't even get on the plane. Where's the man? Where is he? Drop it! Lile! How many? Lile! Freeze! Read me my rights.
