Just tryin' to give the taxpayers their money's worth. I didn't realize that passenger surveillance could be such a tough gig. I mean, if you're not careful, you could end up with eye strain. This is true.

 But I knew the job was dangerous when I took it. Well, next time, cuz, you work Customs. Twenty, 40, 55. Gate D-6. Don't get comfortable. That kid over there just paid cash for a ticket to South America. You got X-ray vision? No, I got counter help. Excuse me, miss. That kid? Eddie Rivers. Where was he going? Bogota. In 34 minutes. Did he have a reservation? Uh-uh. Thanks, Denise. Fits the profile. Let's go to work, partner.

 Ooh! You're all slimy, man. What, do you got a hormone problem? Eddie, man, you need to chill out. I'll give you my ticket, okay? This ain't no joke. Did I ever joke with you? I told you, "I'm goin' to Miami. I'll call you in six weeks with the contact and the money." Now, what happened? I delivered. Louis delivered. Yeah, Louis got lucky at the track. Yeah, that's right. And Louis and Eddie are gonna ride... this lucky streak to the sky, man. So what are we celebrating, fellas? Who the hell are you? Well, we're the guys that are gonna bust y'all... if, uh, Eddie here comes back from Colombia... with anything in that bag except his dirty laundry. That is provided that you don't come back in the cargo section. Although that's a reasonable possibility, seein' that 95% of all these deals are rip-offs. Tubbs, you don't think... that these obviously experienced professionals here are gonna fall for a rip-off. You're right. I mean, how hard can it be to fight your way out of a foreign country, huh? Although I don't know if the, uh, Colombian policemen... would, uh, overlook it. Oh, now, you don't know. They might be a big, partyin' group down there. Plus they got all those neat, uh, rehabilitation techniques, such as sewing your fingers in your mouth... and, uh, lettin' the ants eat your eyeballs out. Of course, that's on top of the usual, more intimate procedures. You fellas want to cough up some I.D.? Damn! Hey, hey! Look out! Watch out! Police officer! It's all right! Later, man. Watch out! Watch out! Hey! Vice, pal. Vice. Dinner for one, Crockett? What do you want, Sloan? Don't you love that evening air? Surprised your nose still works. You're still cranky about that Rojas case, aren't you? Hey, lookit, man... I'm a public defender; you're a cop. Just because I had to play hardball in court doesn't mean you have to get so angry about it. Just because your client paid for his witnesses and his counsel... by the ounce... You're lucky I don't have time to sue you for slander. You're lucky I don't have time to bust you. But it'll happen. Excuse me while I take my pulse. Hey, Sonny, we had a tough fight, and you lost. But, hey, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones. You're a lowlife, Sloan. Nice mouth on this guy. He's my partner. You got any problem with that? Very tough. I'm very impressed. Really. But next month at this time, I'll be in private practice. And you guys will have to put up a month's pay just to make an appointment with me. I'll send you my card. You bust a client of his? Yeah, a dealer named Rojas. Got most of his cash, too, so he couldn't swing an attorney. That slime bucket gets assigned the case, and out of the woodwork comes a dozen witnesses. Rojas walks. Professional witnesses. Yeah, one of 'em came in six months later on a firearms charge. Told me on the sly that Rojas paid everybody off with two ounces of flake. Yeah, well, he must have used his as a down payment on that ride. Oh, no. Sloan got a kilo. Check this out... the computer came up negative on those two kids. Figures. What about the licenses? New York Traffic says the licenses checked out. They also told me that, uh, Martinez, that chump that dumped the table on me, he applied for a license down here. Probably figured that he could retire after they made their deal. Yeah, I've seen it a million times... Teenyboppers from up north come down here with their life savings, think they can make one big score and then get out. What a joke. Well, what do you say we call it a day, pal, over a couple of margaritas? Hey, sorry, man, but Castillo caught me in the computer room. He says we got surveillance duty tonight. On what? Coke lab in South Miami. Patrolman smelled some ether fumes night before last, but the D.A. won't issue a warrant until they actually see some evidence. Yeah, right. You mean like a 55-gallon drum... being conveniently delivered in the middle of the night. You got it, man. Tubbs, you making this up? I wish I was. Well, I'd better get a refill. You want one? Uh... My treat. No, man. Give me one. You sure? Might be a long night. Yeah, I'm a vegetarian. Oh, get outta here. Hey, look, man. I don't see how you can make it through the night... with one of those tubes of mystery meat in your stomach. You're right. Make it two. Oh, nothin' cookin', huh? No. Thought you were asleep. Nah. Keep thinkin' about Sloan. Guys like that... You know, he really is headed for the good life. Hey, forget about that weasel. You done your good deed for the day, you know? That Rivers kid... he's probably wettin' his pants all the way back to New York. You really think we spooked 'em? You never know about kids like that. Sewin' your fingers inside of your mouth? I read it in a comic book. Might have to think of somethin' else next time. Hate to use the same line twice. It's just not gonna work, Louis. - It will, it will, it will. It's all arranged. What about those cops? Who arranged that? They couldn't do nothin' to us. They just wanted to spook us. They did a good job. What if some of those things do happen? What if somebody tries to rip me off? Nothin' is gonna happen. The man's cousin is gonna meet you in Bogota, sell you the stuff, show you how to bring it back here, and we end up with four times what we paid. It's simple. We're gonna get caught. Greedy people get caught. We're just gonna get in and get out. And open up the hippest club in the Apple. Mirrors everywhere, light shows, waitresses workin' for us. That was the dream, wasn't it? We were kids when we dreamed that. Kids don't know no better. This is the final boarding call for Latin American Airlines... Flight 12 to Bogota and Cartagena. All passengers should report to Concourse D, Gate 5 for final boarding. Look, we're partners, right? And if you're too scared to make this deal, we're still partners. Just don't ever tell me you're too scared to dream, man. All right? All right. Let's go. Tubbs. Hmm? Heads up. We got company. Not exactly primitive equipment, Lieutenant. This lab was state-of-the-art. Microwave ovens to dry the product, and in the back, a computer to do the accounting. Any survivors? One. Last guy that died mumbled, uh, something like a name. Moya, I think it was. What is it with these statues, anyway? That's Chango, god of the Santeria... A religion popular in Colombia. Actually originated in Nigeria. A little culture, Switek. Hang around a little bit. Some of it might rub off. Yeah? Well, whatever religious significance these statues have, they have a street value of about 25 grand. Pure coca base, sports fans. What grade? Ninety-plus. Pack it up. You got it, Lieutenant. Put it in here. Put a little paste. And let it dry. Takes maybe... two or three minutes. So, how you know my cousin, huh? Friend of a friend. Mmm. Who's your friend? You don't want to tell me, huh? That's okay. I already know enough people in Miami. This one's dry. Then you put on new gloves, and you put it into another bag. Seems like a lot of trouble. Trouble? This is not trouble. If the dog likes your smell in Customs, then you got trouble. Then you gonna get bake and shake. Hmm? Lucito. Well, what do you think, huh? It's kinda evil-lookin'. It's like a beautiful woman. You gotta be real careful, or she'll take you by... You know, eh? Huh? Eh, eh, eh, eh. Not this guy. No? This guy's gonna make me rich. We goin' some place special, or are you just contributin' to the ozone layer? Remember that girl I busted a few months back, worked in a punk movie theater? Oh, right. Angela. Yeah. She was heavy into that Santeria stuff. Hard to believe that she's the high priestess of any religion. She probably grew up with it in the family. Inherited the title. I'll tell her for you. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on, buddy. Now, her boyfriend... He doesn't exactly strike me... as an equal-opportunity conversationalist. Yeah, but that's the beauty of it, Tubbs. While I pump Angela for information, you get to broaden her boyfriend's mind by being the noble public servant. Call it. Heads. Remember... Diplomacy first, my man. Angela. Get a haircut. We gotta talk. I can't talk now. Uh, I just wanted to ask you some questions about your, uh, bike. Like what's gonna happen if you take one step closer to it? Huh? Forget him. Talk to me. I can't! What, have you got a short memory? Listen, toots, one word from me to the D.A., and you're back to defending a narcotics charge instead of probation. I want to know if the name Moya rings a bell. One of the boys mentioned Diego Moya. What about him? He's got something to do with the gym in South Beach. All right. What else? I don't know anything else. I just wanted to ask you some questions. Yeah, I told my mama I didn't like this tie either. I'll get back to you. - I want to ask you some questions about your bike. Wrong neighborhood, Mr. President. Tell your story walkin'. Oh, I just wanted to ask you some questions about your bike. Edwin Moses, look out! ♪ Hit me with your best shot ♪ ♪ Why don't you hit me with your best shot ♪ ♪ Hit me with your best shot ♪ ♪ Fire away ♪ ♪ You come on with the come-on You don't fight fair ♪ ♪ That's okay See if I care ♪ ♪ Knock me down It's all in vain ♪ ♪ I'll get right back on my feet again ♪ ♪ Hit me with your best shot ♪ ♪ Why don't you hit me with your best shot ♪ ♪ Hit me with your best shot ♪ ♪ Fire away♪♪ You Pepe Moya? No, I'm Dr. Zhivago. What can I do for you? My partner and I are lookin' to invest in a fighter. Really? That's a good thought. Do you know anything about fighting? Enough. That's good too. Listen, if you're really interested in doin' some syndication, you gotta talk to my brother, Diego. Me, I don't handle fighters. Only lovers. Well, where do we find him? You see that kid that's fighting right now? He will be fighting tonight in South Miami, and my brother will be there. I don't think we can make it tonight. Uh, where is he during the day? He's around. He's around. All right, well, uh... Look, that's all right. We'll be there. Come on, partner. Take care. I think I just saw that Martinez kid go out the back of the gym. There he is. - Damn it! Let's stay with him. I thought we'd scare that kid back to New York. I should have known. Punks like that never listen. He was just hangin' around to work on his tan. Yeah? I think he's gonna get burned. There! He went into the Senator. Yeah, thanks. Excuse me. ♪♪ Sounds good, Pops. So how we doin'? There's no one registered here under the name of Martinez or Moya. Well, why don't we, uh, check out that address... that Martinez used to apply for his Florida license? I'll be damned. Get the hell outta here! Huh? Just drive, damn it! Nobody talks that way to me! Not in my cab! Get outta there. You get the hell out of here! Back up! Police officer! Get around. I-I thought they were just souvenirs. Save it, pal. You're under arrest. Do we know for a fact that the Moyas are involved? No. But the statues in Rivers's bag... are identical to the ones that we found in the exploded lab. And Martinez led us straight to him from the Moyas' gym. Well, get some surveillance on that gym as soon as possible, eh? I sent Mann and Teranova, but the Moyas were already gone. What do you want to do? Let him make the sale as planned. See who shows up. How old is he? Old enough to do 15 years. He's the best lead we've got, and his only way out. All right. See if he'll cooperate. Hell, he's probably so scared right now, he'd roll over on his own grandmother. A pound and a half means mandatory time, Eddie! Time! You're gonna do time unless you help us. You have no choice. You don't scare me. Thinks he's tough. Maybe you spend a little time with a lonely cell mate, it'll soften you up. Uh-uh. No more games. Stand up. Sit. Who do you think you are to ask us to beg for your help? I'm not... Shut up! I'm talkin'. You think we don't have better things to do than to teach punks like you about life? Class is over, pal. You committed a felony. Now, either play ball or do the time, startin' right now. Wait. Listen, I want to help, but the lawyer said you're just gonna use me and chump me off! Who said that to you? Mr. Sloan. So the guy was married. Want to do it again? Must be gettin' old. I don't remember doin' it the first time. Hey, come on. Couldn't have been that bad. Didn't I talk dirty to ya? Give me a break. Break? Wanna cop a plea? Hey, you hear they're makin' sex a misdemeanor? The more you miss it, the meaner you get. Hey. Man, what's goin' on? Sit down. Have another drink. Hey, Crockett! Come on. Four-hundred-dollar shirt. Come on! Just part of the floor show. Come on, Crockett. Where do you come off tellin' Eddie Rivers I back out on any deals, huh? Happens all the time. Not when I give my word. Not to a 19-year-old kid lookin' at a dime-and-a-half mandatory. Who says he's guilty? It's an open-and-shut case. Well, I'll file a motion to suppress on the grounds that it was a bad search. Get off it, Sloan! That kid is so green he practically handed us the evidence. Well, that's for the judge to decide. - There's not enough time. The deal for the statues is goin' down right now. There's always time. And if one judge doesn't like it, there's always time for an appeal. Yeah, while that kid is sittin' in a cell somewhere, bein' passed around for a pack of smokes. I'm his attorney, not his guardian. Listen, you maggot. You want to settle our score, I'm available. Anytime. But not at the expense of this kid. I can guarantee him a free walk. Now, you're gonna go to him, and you're gonna tell him that you can do the same thing, right in front of me, pal. How you doin', Ernie? It's Eddie. Right. Eddie. Listen, I been talkin' to the detectives here... About your situation, that is...and, uh... Go ahead. Tell him. Tell him how I lied to him. How you're gonna get him off on a bad search. Get outta here. Now do you believe me, Eddie? We're on your side, pal. You're gonna be all right. You made the right choice. I'll get you out of this in one piece. I promise. Remember, the second he opens that door, you jump outta the way. You said you weren't gonna hurt Louis. Eddie, we're not plannin' to hurt anyone. We just don't know who else might be in there. Just do what you're told. Knock. Who is it? It's me, Eddie. Where you been, man? They caught us, man. What do you mean, "us"? Shut up. - It's safe. Come on. Let's take it inside. - It's clean up here, guys. So you had to snitch on me. Louis, they caught me with the statues. What else could I do? You could have kept your mouth shut! Hey, pal. You didn't really want your partner to go to jail, now, did ya? 'Cause that's exactly what would have happened. And in this state it's 15 years mandatory apiece. Now, we're givin' you a chance to put this behind you. What do you want to do? Les. Not over there. Not over there. Right here. Right here. They're for real, man. What do you want me to do? - I want you to sit tight until we get this place set up. We're lookin' at 32 minutes up here. What is it? What's the matter, Jason? Great show, huh? Nice dress. We got it covered here in the front. Oh, Jason, Jason. Do you mean it? Yeah, everything's okay here. We're gonna make it, Louis. Eddie, you stay sittin' in the chair. There'll be a knock at the door. Louis, you'll answer it. You bring 'em back to the table. Remember when you move from the door to the table, stay to the right side, to the wall. The right side. Yeah. Away from the window. You got that? Yeah. Keep the statues in the refrigerator until they show you the money. As soon as one of them touches the statues, you say... We finally made it. Perfect. These people may want to chitchat before doin' business. Keep the conversation short. You'd like to talk, but you've got other appointments. Okay, and last but not least, nobody leaves this room... I mean, nobody. If one of 'em says, "I gotta use the bathroom" or "I left something in the hall," you give us the cue right then and right there. You got that? Hey, guys, I think we're on. Two dudes just got out of a white Mercedes, and one's carryin' an attaché case. Nobody move! Diego Moya? Everybody okay? Eddie, you okay? I want to go home! Please. Please. Tonight, Eddie. Tonight, Eddie. Tonight. You and Louis, just like I promised. Take it easy. Take it easy. Yeah, right. This is... This is Sonny Crockett. Uh-huh. Yeah, I'm a friend of Angela's. No way to avoid it? He pulled a gun. Solid rip-off. At least we know that, uh, Pepe Moya's the guy to look after. Did you get anything from him? His lawyer's phone number. How about Crockett's informant? - He's lookin' her up right now. Get some extra bodies watching the airport. And have the guys on the stakeout start shaking down some people. If we don't find Moya before he finds out about his brother, there's gonna be a bloodbath. All right. Thanks a lot. I don't think I need to tell you... where the first drops are gonna come from. Come on, Tubbs. We're goin' to the fights. - Fill me in. Pepe Moya gave us a line on a middleweight that's fighting tonight. As it turns out, my friend Angela's already down there. If she can't tell us where Moya is, she probably knows who can. Keep me posted. You got it. Later, Lieutenant. Gentlemen. Larry, Stan. Hide these gentlemen until I can find a safe place, all right? Until I can get 'em out of town. I'm gonna call the D.A. now. Okay, Lieutenant. Officer... What is it, Eddie and Louis? Guys, we're gonna take you to the safe house until it's time to go to the airport. Uh, what...what's a safe house? It's just a motel. Yeah, it's like, you know, campin' out. We'll get some pizza, sing some songs. We'll have fun. I can't talk now. You're gonna tell me everything you know about the Moyas right now. I don't know anything. I told you I heard the name from one of the guys! Which one? Angela, if your old man is in this, you'd better tell me now if you want me to help him. Nine people got killed in a coke lab last night. And Diego Moya... He bought it tryin' to rip off two kids. Nobody's walkin' away from this game. No way. I won't help you later if you don't help us now. Please! Zeke's good to me. I'll do the best I can. I gotta know everything. All's I know is they buy these chemicals, and this guy named Pepe tells them where to take them. What'd I tell you about talkin' to strangers? No. Stand over there and relax. Tough guy, huh? Real tough. Hey, look what I found. One plus, baby. A deadly weapon. So you like to beat on women, chump. No! No. Get back! Get over there. We're lookin' for Pepe Moya. Never heard of him. Listen, chum, we just put Diego Moya in a body bag, and unless you start talkin' real fast, you and all your playmates are goin' in on a conspiracy charge. Please, Zeke! Who's gonna take care of... Quiet! Shoot. Buyin' ether and acetone... I ain't done nothin' that bad. Then you got nothin' to be afraid of. All right. I'm not afraid of you two. Fine, tough guy. Talk. Angela, go back with the boys. Pepe Moya's a freak. Gets off on weird stuff. Cuttin' up animals for his religion. Just tell us where he is, and he's out of this game. I don't know where Moya is. But I can tell you where to find the main lab. I'm all ears. We know the players. We found the labs. Come on. Let us in on the sweep. Go home. Get some rest. Hey, Lieutenant, we are not that tired. Good. Then go take the two kids to the airport... and relieve Switek and Zito. Look, I'm givin' you the milk run 'cause you did a good job, and you need a break. Thanks. Thanks, Lieutenant. Five, six, seven, eight. Ha! That was close. Pacific...Who owns it? Stan, why don't you save the last piece for him? He doesn't want it. You sure? It's good pizza. Don't want any. - Come on, man. We're goin' home. Why don't you have somethin' to eat and relax? I'm relaxed. I'm just not hungry. So what, is it my roll? Wait. Let me buy Pacific. I own Pacific. Come on, Stan. - It's not funny. I thought it was. Hi. Hi, yourself. Slumber party's over, girls. Let's go home. You cheatin' again, Zito? And if either of you chumps gets in any trouble up north, we will both personally come up and kick your butts. Hear that, Louis? I hear you. I'll buy you the tickets. What about it, Tubbs? When do I get the grand tour of the Big Apple? As soon as I think you can handle it, partner. Yo. Handle this, pal. You guys, you come up anytime, and we will show you where it is. You better watch out for your sister. Buck. Get outta here. I got it. Hey, no wonder people deal drugs around here. Just a joke. Don't be a wise guy. Sorry. Listen. Hey, uh, when can you send me my stuff? What stuff? Oh, yeah. Your stuff... Eddie! There's a traffic cop outside. Get an ambulance. Move! Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. - Final boarding call for Flight 302, nonstop to New York. Go get on the plane. All passengers holding tickets on Flight 302... please report to Gate 7 immediately. Go on. Go home. You think this is a joke? Look at your friend. Get on the damn plane. Hey, Louis. Make sure he gets on the plane. Let's go get the car. Yeah, let's go get the car.
