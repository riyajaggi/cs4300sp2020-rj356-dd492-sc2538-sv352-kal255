I'm on vacation, relaxing from the stress and strain of "urbal" existence. You know, easin' up on the action. What action, man? You've practically been the invisible man. You poppin' again, Noogie? - Poppin'? Man, I'm break dancing. See, I'm the jewel of the jungle and you know that. Yeah, right. You so high right now, you need clearance to land. Let me tell you, man. I got to mingle with the people, you understand? Ain't nothing happenin' down at the library. Right? Then it like, I need a little something... to get my head together every now and then, you understand? But it ain't like I ain't got nothing. This week, let me tell ya. I got a special on Jordache jeans. I got ballpoint pens. I got watches from Trinidad, right? And if you fellas do the right thing, I'll put you down on a discount. Noogie. - Wh-What's up, man? What you want, some jewelry? How about a bank bounce? I know y'all want something, man... Cut the crap, man. Stop jivin' us with all of this bank bounces and other con. Noogie, what's the action, pal? We know you're connected with about 90% of everything that moves in this town, you got a line on it. See, I told you fellas. The Noogman's on vacation, man. A businessman like me got to get some kind of relaxation sometimes, man. ♪ Baby, I love you and you know that I ♪ ♪ You know I-I ♪♪ You're gonna need help, pal. You turn us away with zero, one good turn deserves another. You get my drift? Come on, man. You wouldn't do that to the Noog, man. I told you...What's wrong, you don't believe me, man? I told you if I had some info I would lay it on you. See, now you're dissin' me. My man. I see you know how to deal with the Noogman, you understand what I'm saying? That 50, man? I know this dude named Trick Baby that hangs downtown, man, you know what I'm sayin'? He gave me some info last week that may be helpful to you. You know what I mean, man? For a couple more of these, man, I get you all the info you need. I'm gonna duke ya to a warehouse full of speed, pal. I mean amphetamines, uppers, downers, black beauties. You want some... No, thanks. Ooh, can I have the next dance? Hey, there, love cheeks. Whoa, great outfits, girls. Got you walking the streets again or is it Halloween? Funny, Crockett. Yeah, I got your trick or treat. I think they look pretty good. I gotta make this fast. Crockett, Tubbs, where you at right now? Well, the Noogman gave us a line on a load of amphetamines. He says it's stashed in a warehouse on 22nd Street. We're gonna check it out. Need any backup? - Uh-uh. Strictly small-time. All right. Zito, Switek, I want you to back up Trudy and Gina. Finally got a picture on Ramirez. Master pimp. Everything from streetwalkers to your thousand dollar-a-night call girls. On call to visiting conventioneers and politicians, the works. Where you guys at? The streets, bottom rung. We connected with this minor sleaze, Cinco, who works for Ramirez. We haven't even met the main man yet. - That's him. You're moving up the ladder to get him. He personally puts you out on call, we got a bust. A major coup. Cover 'em. I don't want anything to go wrong. I'd rather blow the investigation than lose somebody. Two girls, very well carved on female bodies, floated up in the beach in Broward. They were former Ramirez girls. They were starting their own out-call service. Don't get yourself compromised. Don't worry about us, Lieutenant. They haven't invented a tricky situation we can't handle. That's pretty good, Gina. "Tricky situation." Thank you. You oughta put that in your routine. Puns? That's for some cheap lounge act. I do inventive comedy. Excuse me all to hell. What time is it? Let's go. Hey, you. You in the blue dress. So you wanna party, honey? Sure, I took a shower and everything. Get in. You're so romantic. Drive off. Oh, hi. Wanna party? How much? $250, cowboy. Can you handle it? I told you this was some good information. You did not. You said there was nothing here. I said that? Let's go check it out. Well, I don't know what we got. Hey, pal. Miami Vice. Come here. What's your name? Rickert. Bob Rickert. What's going on, Bob? Nothing. What's in the boxes? Um, just storing some stuff. What's your name? Bob Rickert. Mind if we take a look? Well, there's nothing, uh, a look? Uh... Oh, you should've locked that, Bob. Uh, do you have a warrant? Warrant? We can have one here in about five minutes, pal, if you wanna go that route. No, I didn't think so. Well, go ahead, but it ain't what it looks like. Well, well, well. You got a regular smorgasbord here of dope, eh, pal? Tell me about it. I can't. - Empty your pockets out on the floor. Spread 'em. Step back. He's clean. Look, um, isn't there something we could, uh...we could do? What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? You have the right to remain silent. If you choose not to remain silent, anything you say may be used against you in court. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. You understand these rights? Yeah. You understand? Yeah. You're big time, aren't you, Bob? You push junk, don't you, Bob, huh? Don't you talk bribes with me, pal. You're in enough trouble as it is. Here. Set up here until I get some help. I'll take him in. Get out there. Where are you taking me? You've never been to jail, huh, kid? Come here. Look at the bottom. That's jail. That's where you're going. They got guys up there that are gonna love you. You gay? I got a wife. Gee, that's too bad, 'cause we're talking five years before you see her again. What's she gonna do? I'm just helping some friends, that's all. From college. I don't sell this stuff, and I sure don't use it. Keep talking. I can't. How do you feel about not seeing your wife again till '89? I rent a place. They drop the stuff off. It's picked up and delivered. That's all I do. When's the pickup? You know what you're asking me to do? Hey, pal, you made this choice. Tomorrow morning. Where's this load going? Some guy's house in North Miami. His name is Alvarado. 125 Riverside. Will I, uh... Will I have to go to court? You do nothing. Let them make their pickup just as usual. Just relax, like nothing's changed. Go home and be with your wife. Go home, kid. Ladies and gentlemen. Bienvenidos. Welcome to the Club Ocho... The myth of Miami. Wanna date? Weirdo boss man's right there behind you. Take it easy. Uh, so, I don't know. Maybe... What? I'm a lady. I don't take pictures with nobodies. What is she doing? Why isn't she with him? Why don't you quit breathing down our backs? - I don't like this guy. Turn around. Turn around. I'm gonna... - Don't! You always have to mess up the merchandise, don't you? You better lay some bread on me, baby. Or what? Because you're no good to me otherwise. Not bad. That's nothing compared to what you'll see when you get me off the streets. When the man thinks the time is right. Of course, we might make it sooner if you, uh, lighten up. I don't wanna catch nothing. You're a hot one. That's the one. That's the address the kid gave us. This guy's serious. Get outta there! It's time. Let's go. Mmm. Sit down. Let's go. Get outta here. Here. Cristal '75. You have some business to talk over with me? Do I look like somebody who should be working on the streets? Yeah, why not? Ah. You're a very beautiful girl. What's your name? Paula. You want to get off the street? What do you got to offer me? Money. In exchange for what? Protection. You're the one who provides it. I'm from Chicago. This place has great action, but no competition. A lot of my book travels out here anyway, so it's convenient. Why'd you leave Chicago? Small problems, a little heat. It was time to move on. What's your game? Strictly call-outs. Conventions. Vacationers. Politicians. High rollers from the islands. A thousand a throw. Sheesh, expensive. I'm worth it. Yeah. My end? Perhaps some personal favor? As long as I pay, it's just business. You know, uh, I think I can do this. Show business, you know? I think I've been bitten by the bug. What'd he call us in for anyway? I don't know. That's what we're gonna find out. Hello, Dick. Sonny. What's shakin'? This is my partner, Rico Tubbs. You two know each other? Yeah, we bumped into each other a couple of times... before, uh, Dick here became big-time. So what are we here for? I wanted to talk to you face-to-face. What's on your mind? I represent Sally Alvarado. As you know, a heavy bond was posted as soon as he was eligible. That should show you this case involves people of means. Big time. He's a punk... worse. What I'm wondering is, why is a big-time lawyer like yourself handling his case? What'd we step in? - More than you can handle. Your warrant is based on information from a confidential source. I'll need to know the identity of your informant for my client's defense. I'm doing you a favor by telling you now instead of in court. My informants are mine, pal, and they stay that way. It'll be an issue in my pretrial motion to beat the warrant. Existing case law's on my side. Sonny... Why not make it easier for everybody? You guys are out of your league. No, we're not gonna make it easy on you, Dick. You're gonna have to do your job. What happened out there this morning doesn't count for nothing, does it? I mean, your client could've shot me and my partner and that'd be okay too. Let's get out of here, man. My informant's name is 39. I did a really stupid thing. I got involved selling drugs with these guys from school. What? - I got arrested. This cop let me off, but I told him what I know. And, uh, I'm scared. I don't know what to do. But it's over. These guys I told him about... They're dangerous. What will happen, Bobby? I'm so worried. We gotta get away from here. See you guys in the room. Yeah, right. All right, look, if he contacts you, I wanna hear from you right away, you got it? No. Don't call me from your home phone. Okay. O-Okay. Just relax. All right. What'd you find out? - Nothing in the intelligence files on Rickert. Alvarado? - Alvarado. Some sheet. Investigation of murder three times, attempted murder twice. And the Bronco, it wasn't stolen. Nothing. That was Rickert. He's coming apart at the seams. He's scared to death. You blame him? You wanna hide him? We got to. Let's go see the boss. Yeah. Where are you with this case? We're nowhere. We put three charges on this guy, Alvarado. The guy we busted? Before we finished our report, he's out on bond. I don't know who it is, but somebody spent a lot of money to get this guy off the hook. Where'd you get the case? - Informants. Well, you rang somebody's bell. Hard. Richard Cain has subpoenaed all your informant warrants and your affidavits. D.A. doesn't wanna brush this one off. They wanna prosecute. They will force you to name, uh, your informant. We blow the case if we identify the informant. They'll attack the affidavit for warrants. Plus, I'll have a canary out on a limb. They get a judge who wants to push the issue, you can go to jail on a contempt citation if you don't name that informant. You got a decision to make, Sonny. I've taken under advisement the arguments of counsel... regarding the procurement and issuance of Mr. Crockett's search warrant. It looks good to me. On motion of the defense, Mr. Cain has brought up an interesting point of law. His client has the right to know his accuser for purposes of questioning. So on that motion, I hold for the defense. Mr. Crockett, I order you to stand before this court... and identify your informant. I'm sorry, Your Honor. I can't do that. You understand the consequences of your decision? Yes, Your Honor. I do. Mr. Crockett, I feel more strongly than other judges on this issue. I ask you again. Who is your informant? I order you here and now to comply with this court. I'm sorry, Your Honor, but I cannot do that. Then I have no alternative but to hold you in contempt of court... and instruct the bailiff to take you into custody for 30 days... or until this court is satisfied. You know as well I do that it's my job to deal with informants. If I give you one, I may as well give you all of 'em, because nobody on the streets is ever gonna trust me again. You have disobeyed a direct order from this court... - I'm a police officer. - I will not stand for this disrespect... I'm a police officer. Will the court entertain... a bond hearing on the contempt charge? - Court is adjourned. You know that cop I told you about? He's in jail. He wouldn't identify me in court. Please, sit down. Happy that you could come. Have something to drink. No, thank you. Everything's been good since you've made our arrangement. I hope you're pleased. I have no complaints. Cinco says you've been doing very well since you're with us. We should've got you out of that bar sooner. I'm sorry to have to say that. But now, I plan to expose you to an elite clientele. You'll make lots of money, and you're to accompany me on certain special business trips. I'm flattered. I'm sure I'll live up to your expectations. Tonight I'm having some friends over for dinner. I wish you to be here. Say 9:00? I'll look forward to it. A party. What are you doing here? I have business with your boss. I need to talk to you about some possible problems. What problems? It seems there's a van parked in Little Havana. We found some equipment. There may be a wiretap. Somebody taking pictures. Wiretap who? There's wire stretched all over this town. On you? The clubs? What? - I don't know. What is it? Cops? Feds? What? I don't know, sir. - What do I pay you for? To protect me, not to sit there and say you don't know. "I don't know." Where there's a wiretap, there's an informant. How long has that girl Paula been around? Couple of months. Everything's been very smooth. Now there's more arrests. Revenue drops off. She has to leave Chicago for some trouble. Suddenly a wiretap. I say she left Chicago because she was somebody's informant. Get rid of her. Now. Fast. Whoa, not too fast. I gotta see her tonight. Afterwards. Where the hell have you been? I hit. - What? He wants me to meet new people. The big money. Go with him on business deals. He wants me to have dinner with him tonight. Dinner. - Yeah. Business. He's having other people come... top people. Well, you can't go without backup. Then take me as your friend. I can't. I can't. He wants me to go there alone. He's got other people coming. He wants to talk. What are you gonna do if he wants more than just talk? What is with you? I can handle this. All right. How about this one. - Come on. Come on. Let's go. Get some chicken, some pizza and some nutty buddies. What do you think? You know, for the movie? When is he gonna stop this? Try it again, Stan. It's not funny yet. Sonny. Hey. All right. - This guy looks familiar. How you feel? Well, you must've pulled in some pretty heavy markers to get me out. Thanks. I don't use markers, Sonny. Rickert went into Cain's office and identified himself as your informant. While you were sitting, he called here. Heard about it in the newspaper. He was real upset. Everything I tried to do to calm him down, nothing would work, man. Damn it. There was no way to know, man. No way to stop him. Yeah, great. Tell that to his widow. Now what? The case is blown. Cain got Rickert to agree not to testify in a new pretrial on the warrant. He withdrew his motion in front of Judge Cohen, and... Alvarado walks. Walked. Wonderful. That's just wonderful. We got a pusher, a suspected mob hit man and God knows what else, and he does less time in this case than I did. ♪ Love ♪ ♪ Is such a precious thing ♪ ♪ All of the joy it brings ♪ You look great. ♪ To your heart ♪ When are the others coming?

What do you know about it? He's gonna kill the guy who set him up. He knows who it is. The cops got him stashed, but he'll find him, believe me. Come on. Come on, pal. I need more. I've been with Alvarado when he's killed, I'm dying. You take care of me... I'll help you. Where do we find Alvarado? - Club Ocho. All right. You're gonna be all right. Take care of this guy.

You're under arrest, Alvarado. That's very funny. You oughta take your act up there on the stage. I think the people would enjoy it. You got nothing on me. Nobody's gonna snitch. Cinco did. Six murders. Prostitution. Drugs. You are lost. You can come along nice-like, or you don't have to come along at all. Hi. What are you doing after the show? Oh, I see we're having a problem with someone not being able to pay their bill. Now let that be a lesson to you, ladies and gentlemen. You can't pay your bill, you get a little police escort.
