 [funky quizzical music] Alright, guys. Who's ready to party? [Gaten] Pretty nice place, right? This is a very special Prank Encounters starring yours truly. Today, we've made up a story about Stacey, a little girl who's about to turn eight years old and, wouldn't you know it, Stacey is a big fan of mine. So, when I got her letter begging me to be the guest of honor at the party being held at her house, I, of course, said yes. However, the family's gardener, Julian, was going to warn me not to come. But, Stacey's not-so-stable dad, Jerry... Well, he made sure that didn't happen. The good news is: none of this is real. The bad news: we won't be telling that to these two, who have the important task of making sure Stacey's party goes off without a hitch. Good luck with that. Ashanti believes she's taking on a one-day gig to help out a party planning company. She'll be helping out planner Becky, being played by Mary, to ensure that every detail of Stacey's celebration is up to Jerry's insanely high standards. Meanwhile, across town, Kelsey's been in touch with my fast-talking manager, Eddie. She's agreed to be my personal assistant for the day and to tag along to the party. Ashanti and Kelsey have never met, but their paths are about to collide at the most terrifying kid's birthday party ever. Everyone they're about to meet today are actors, and it's all being caught on hidden camera. Alright. I have to get ready for this party. [Eddie] Okay, so we have a few things to talk about. I'm going to sit here. Can you sit in the other seat? - [Kelsey] Not at all. - Thank you. It was "Kelsey"? - [Kelsey] Yes. - Great. [Eddie] It's toasty in here. First of all, welcome aboard. [Kelsey] Hi. So, I am a manager, an acting manager, from Los Angeles and I represent... Do you know Gaten Matarazzo? He plays Dustin on Stranger Things. [Kelsey] Yes. And, we have a birthday party we're going to, because Gaten loves to reach out to his fans. It's going to be so much fun. Do you know what? This is so cute. So, the girl, who has the birthday, gave me this letter requesting Gaten for her birthday party. Do you mind holding that, and when Gaten gets in here, - can you read it to him? - Yeah? [Eddie] Because, he hasn't read it yet. - Yeah, it's so sweet. - [Kelsey] I can read it. It's so sweet. One more thing: So, Gaten has kind of a rider sheet, a list of things that he likes to eat. Okay. - [Eddie] I'm going to give this to you... - Alright. ...to establish those items are at the party. Okay. I'm going to grab Gaten and be back in a second. Okay. Thank you. Oh... [doorbell rings] Hey, how you doing? Hi, I'm Becky. Come on in. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - [Becky] This is Patti. This is Ashanti. - Hi, I'm Patti. Nice to meet you. The owner is coming down. I'm going to have you stand right here. I'll take your bag and... Yeah, you know what? We have a celebrity here today, so I'm going to ask if I can take your phone, too. Thank you. I'll put it right over here. I'll take your scarf, too, if you don't mind. Yeah. It's freezing outside. [Becky] I know, right? - [Jerry] Welcome to my home. - Good morning, Mr. Jerry. Thank you so much for coming, and thank you for lining up. Of course. This is my crew today. [Jerry] Welcome. - [Becky] Thank you, Mr. Jerry. - We've met, yes? [Becky] Nice to see you. It's a pleasure. Thank you for making this day so wonderful for my daughter... Stacey. It's her eighth birthday, and I just... I want things to go exactly... exactly... perfectly.

One hundred percent fun. Yes, sir. - [Jerry] Follow me single file please. - Ashanti, do you mind? Can you guys each get one? Use your legs, okay? - [Eddie] We'll get you right over here. - On this side? [Eddie] Yeah, on this side, here. - [Eddie] Okay, Kelsey, this is Gaten. - [Gaten] Hi. - Hi. - [Gaten] How are you? - [Kelsey] Good. How are you? - Nice to meet you. [Gaten] Thanks so much for helping out here. I really do appreciate it. [Kelsey] Of course, I'm happy to. - [Eddie] Kelsey's cool. - Wonderful. [Gaten] I'm glad to hear it. I'm going to do a quick photo. Ready? - Perfect. Okay, great. - [Gaten] Awesome. You're not going to be doing that all day, are you? [Eddie] All day, buddy. All day. - Got to get a lot of photos. - [Gaten] Oh, I got it. The birthday girl gave you a letter. - Aww. - "Dear Gaten. My birthday is in three weeks and I'm turning eight years old. I want to have a huge party with big balloons, but last year, when I turned seven, nobody came to my party and it made me really sad. This year, I want to invite my favorite person ever to my party: You! [Gaten chuckles] [Kelsey] I love Stranger Things, and wish I was friends with you and your friends. If you would come to my party, it would be the most epic party ever! And, you can bring whoever you want, and I will make you special cupcakes." - Special cupcakes? - [Kelsey] "Your friend, Stacey." [Eddie] Yes, Kelsey! - [Kelsey] Thank you very much. - [Gaten] That was wonderful. I just want that to look amazing, because I haven't even told Jerry about that, - so what do you guys think? - I think it's so beautiful. - [Ashanti] It is so pretty. - Right? Isn't it awesome? And, it matches everything. - [Becky] See how it brings out the colors? - [Ashanti] Yeah. How are we doing? Very well? I love what you've... [Becky] Thank you, sir. What's that? - That's the cake. - Oh. [Becky] That is actually a present from me to you, so... Hmm. Alright. I'm just going to... Yeah. I wasn't expecting this. Sorry. You're doing a great job. A great job. - [Becky] I don't think he liked the cake. - I think he was fine with it. [Patti] What's he doing? [cake splats] - [Patti gasps] - [Becky] Oh, man! Come on. Oh, wow. That was like 67 dollars. out of my own pocket. These are the pastries for the party. [Becky] Those are lovely. - That's so lovely. - Those look really nice. [Jerry] Guess who made these? Did she make those? Stacey. Oh, wow. She's a great baker. - [Ashanti] They look very nice. - [Becky] That's so sweet. [Jerry] Wait. There's one more cupcake. I have to go find it. [Becky chuckles] [Jerry makes dramatic sound effects] Oh. Lovely. [Ashanti] That's beautiful. I'm guessing this is Gaten's cupcake. You are correct, as always. [Patti gasps] Oh, my God. You guys... - You guys ready? Are you excited? - [Kelsey] Yes. - [Gaten] I'm excited. - [Eddie] Let's do it! Oh, God.

So, Kelsey, I'm going to take you back over there. [Kelsey] Okay. - Fun, right? Fun. - [Becky] Thank you. Yes. It's going to be great. [Jerry] So, I'll take you back over here, and... This is a weird option of snacks. [Eddie] Hey. [Jerry] Go ahead and have a seat, and I'll come get you. Okay, guys? Okay. - [Kelsey] Thank you. - [Eddie] Yeah. It looks amazing. - It does? - It looks so good. - [Eddie] Really? - Yes. I'm trying to, um... That one's good. I like it when you can stick your finger in, but not to go all the way up to the first knuckle. Almost there. That's perfect. This one over here, I can tell is not right. It goes all the way to the knuckle almost, as I go in there. This one also. - [Becky] Okay. - [Jerry] Great. I'll fix those. Did you notice, outside, the grounds and how they were kept? - It's lovely. - [Ashanti] Yeah. It's kept very well. Yeah, no. Did you notice how the shrubs are not aligned, and how they're different heights? I don't know if anyone would notice that. I didn't notice it at all. Yeah, I'm not very happy. I've had to let Julian, the gardener, go. And, I just wanted you to confirm that you agree with me... - Absolutely. - Yeah. - ...and it seems like you do agree. - Yeah, absolutely. Gaten is going to be coming in soon, so I want everyone to look sharp. [excited moan] It's party time. Okay. - [Becky] Okay. - [Ashanti] Okay. [Becky] She's going to love it. He wants to feel like he's doing something. It's okay. Just let him do it. Stacey? Are you ready? I want to do this for the little girl, but I kind of feel like once we get the opportunity, we should just book it. I'm with you. - Okay? - [Eddie] Alright. There are no kids. It was the three party planners. [sighs excitedly] - Hey. - Hey. So, yeah. We're ready for the party. [Eddie] Okay. Great. Cool. - [Jerry] Fun! Fun! - Okay! Remember, everybody, assigned seating... - I'm sorry, but, assigned seating. - No, it's all right. Everyone just sits where... - Well, you'll see. - Okay. - Ah! - [Becky] Hi! How are you? [Gaten] This is great! My god! [Kelsey] It looks so good. - How are you? - I'm Becky. Nice to meet you. Hi, Becky. I'm Gaten. - I'm Patti. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. I'm Ashanti.

Okay, but before you take a bite, just bring it up to your mouth. [Gaten] Okay. [Eddie] And, smile. Ready? One, two, three... [camera clicks] Go ahead. Take... Perfect. That's awesome. [Becky] Woo!

Thank you. - [Eddie] Yeah. Do you have coconut water? - [Becky] I do, yes. I do. - [Eddie] Great. Alright. Bring the cupcake up to you and Kelsey. My God. - [Eddie] Just don't take a bite. - [Gaten] Okay, I won't. Do you mind coming with me? I think it is in my van. Sure. [Eddie] Ready? Like you're going to eat it - Yeah. One, two, three... - [camera clicks] [Eddie] Yeah. Awesome. You guys, excuse me, I have the coconut water. I'm going to go out to my van. I'll be right back. - You don't have it in here? - I'm so sorry. [Jerry]Just saying, on behalf of my household staff, I'm disturbed by this. [Becky] I'm so sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about. Alright, we're going to get the water. If you can't get it, that's totally fine. [Ashanti whispering] It's okay. [Becky whispering] Sorry. Thank you. Thank you so much. [Gaten] Are you alright, Jerry? Jerry? [Jerry] Be right back. [Eddie] I'm going to make a phone call real quick. [chews] This is good. [Ashanti] You said you picked it up this morning. [Becky] Yes, I did. I'm not feeling great right now. - It's going to be okay. - No, my stomach. - Your stomach? - [Patti] Are you okay? My stomach is hurting a little bit. I'll be fine. I just feel nauseous. Um... Shit. Eddie usually carries antacid for me. You want me to go get him? Yeah, can you get me the antacid from him? - Yeah. - Thank you. Hey, Eddie? Ashanti is out, looking for the coconut water, and Kelsey really thinks I'm sick. I think it's time to push it a step further. Okay. [Eddie clears his throat] Okay. Thank you. Bye. Hey, do you have that antacid for Gaten? I'm sorry. My stomach really hurts. - Just now? - [Eddie] Yeah. His stomach isn't feeling well, either. Alright. Let's check on him. Oh, God. I feel really bloated. Where's the water? Are they outside? [Becky] Yes! Oh, my God, I got it! Thank you! [Becky and Ashanti laugh] [Becky] I knew I put it under something. [Eddie] Okay. [belches] Who made those cupcakes? He said Stacey made them. [Becky breathing heavily] [front door opens] Oh, thank God. - Okay. - [Kelsey] Okay. We need some water. They both need water. - [Becky] What's going on? - [Ashanti] I got you. - Thank you. - They don't feel well. My... Gaten's stomach does not feel good. - I don't also feel that great. - [Gaten belches] I'm a little concerned about the cupcakes. Eddie had a cupcake, too, and now they're both like this. [Gaten] It's just like a sharp pain. I want to get out of here. Do you have your van coming? [Eddie] I'll call them. - Gaten, are you okay? - No, I'm not. Help! Hey! What the hell are you all still doing here? Y'all better get out of here! - [Becky] Why? - [Julian] He's crazy! This man is crazy! Help me get out of here! Help me, man! This guy is crazy! Come on, somebody untie me. - [Julian] Somebody has to untie me. - [Jerry] Hey! - [muffled groans] - [Jerry grumbling] Let's go! Welcome to my birthday, everybody. Gaten?

I thought he was about to come out with a sledgehammer and kill me. I was like, "I'm never going to make it home!" You know, my last thought was that I needed to tackle you. I was so... You were getting up, and you were starting to act crazy, and I was like, "This is it." I got the heebie-jeebies. Everyone, let's celebrate. To Kelsey and Ashanti. - Cheers! - Cheers! [Sven] You guys are the greatest. [applause] [Ashanti laughs and sobs] They got us.
