 When two complete strangers each agree to take on a one-day gig... - You're gonna be a security guard. - I am dying to get a new assistant. ...it's business as usual, until their paths collide and these temporary assignments turn into all-out supernatural surprises. Oh my God! It's the most elaborate hidden camera prank show ever devised. What the hell?! Double the stakes... What is that?!

 ...and double the scares. My God! And there's only one person with his finger on the button when you least expect it. All right, let's cue another scare. This is where fear... meets funny. You're on my prank show, Prank Encounters. - Did you know? - No! This is Prank Encounters. Little kids have terrific imaginations, especially when it comes to their toys. For this Prank Encounter, we've made up a story of a little girl who has a very, very vivid imagination.

 Her name is Opal, and for some weird reason, she believes her teddy bear sprang to life and killed her older sister. Crazy, right? The only thing worse than that story would be having to babysit that little girl, and that's where Theodora comes in. Now, she believes she's been hired to babysit little Opal while her mom goes out for the evening. Now, can you show me Vertiz? Vertiz thinks he's working for a charity called Pick Me Ups, a company that takes unwanted toys and donates them to needy children. Now, Theodora and Vertiz have never met before, but tonight, they will, and when they do, they'll have to convince sweet Opal to give up her teddy bear. Now, this is Prank Encounters, which means Theodora and Vertiz have no clue that everyone they're about to meet are actors and everything that happens to them we'll be capturing on hidden camera. All right. Everyone ready? Let's go. - Hi, Sherry. - Hi! Hi! How are you? Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Sherry. Nice to meet you! Thank you so much for coming. And it's "Theodore"? - "Theodora"? - Theodora. - Yeah. Like Theodore, but with an A. - That's so pretty! - Well, I have not gotten out in a while. - Okay! Tonight's the night. Jackie knows how excited I am. I'm going to meet a plastic surgeon tonight. I should be home around midnight, but you never know, I might stop and get a nightcap, you never know. - Well, you look wonderful. - Thank you. - Jackie is my eyes, my ears, my help. - Awesome. It really just makes such a difference tonight for you to be here. Yeah, I'm happy to help. - I'm so glad. - A hundred percent. All right, Tony, show me Vertiz. - "Ver..." What is it? "Ver"-what? - Vertiz. Vertiz. Now, what is that? I have no idea. I'm named after my dad, but I'm pretty sure my grandma just completely came up with the name. Everyone in my family only calls me VJ. Have you ever heard of "Pick Me Ups," the charity? No. Okay, basically what we do is we pick up charitable items - from people who are donating them... - Okay. ...and we give them to the less fortunate for a... - pick-me-up. - Oh, okay, cool! - So, do you get how the name works? - Yes, yes! Cool, cool. So, I have a lot going on. First thing is I have a company coming by to take some stuff away for charity. Just some old clothes, - some toys that we don't want anymore. - That's nice. I have a list of the things they're collecting. Those are the items we're picking up. So, a couple of things: You'll coordinate with the homeowner, whoever's there. They also have a list. The puzzles for sure, the board games... ...box of dresses, two boxes of pillows... ...two boxes of clothes. Yeah, just make sure that my spandex, the ones that are green, are not in there, I can't find them. Which reminds me, I cannot find my phone. Have you seen my phone? I also have a ceramic owl figurine. There's a giant teddy bear. And we're definitely getting rid of the teddy bear. Are you sure we're getting... We're getting rid of the teddy bear. Thank you. It's time to tell them about the family tragedy. Sounds like maybe... Wait, what's the... Looks like kids' stuff, huh? Hold on, wait... What was that address again? It was 100 Valley Lane North East. Oh, wait. That's not that address... I believe that's the same address... There was an accident at that address. Oh, okay. - Did you see it on the news? - No, I did not. We've kind of had a tragedy about a year ago. I lost my oldest daughter. Did you see that on the news? - I didn't. I'm sorry to hear that. - Okay. So, the toys that we're giving away belonged to my older daughter Jade. She's the one we lost. I guess somebody got hurt falling off a balcony? A little girl? So maybe she... Maybe that's the girl that's donating. Wow. A loss is definitely something that affects everyone differently, but moving on is half the battle. Yes, and for children, the trauma level is beyond anything you can imagine. I've noticed that my daughter has just reacted in ways that I can't even comprehend. Things mean more to her. Certain things you would never think are of importance are of huge importance. She feels that she has a relationship with certain toys. It takes imaginary friends way above and beyond. Everyone has a different way to cope. Yeah, that's what a lot of the psychiatrists have said. All right, it's time for her to meet Opal. So, I'm going to introduce you to my daughter. Okay. Awesome. And definitely don't let her ask for snacks later. She'll go, "Xavier wants snacks." - Yes, exactly. - Which is her teddy bear. "Xavier wants snacks," and it means she wants snacks. Yes, "Xavier stole the snacks," "Xavier put toilet paper in all of your high heels." Yeah, Xavier is going bye-bye tonight. Opal, hi! Hi, sweetie. How are you? Come on in here. You can come have a seat right next to Opal. - This is Theodora. - Hi, Opal. I like your hair. - Thank you. - It's really pretty. And your dress. Is that your favorite color? - Yeah. - Really? That's my favorite color, too. - Oh! - I love maroon. I kind of have darker colors of that in my blouse. How old are you? I'm nine. That's cool! - My sister Jade would have been 11. - Really? I'm sure you miss her. She still talks to me. Really? Well... Anyway, you guys seem to be getting along well, right? This is good! Okay, so, I just need to get my phone. Ask her if she's seen your phone. Opal, were you playing with my phone today? - No, Mommy. - Okay. You haven't seen it? Maybe Xavier took it. Maybe Xavier took it. Oh, that's very funny, Opal.Yeah. All right, Vertiz is close to arriving at the family house. Time for Xavier the Bear to make a call. Like... Oh. Will you answer that? Hello? Where's Mama Bear? Mama! Mama! - Someone said "mama." - What? Someone said "mama." It sounds like a little kid. Xavier's my sister's bear. He likes to take things. He's nice if you're nice to him. Really? I'm sorry, can I ask who's speaking? Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Yikes. Okay, well, I gotta find my phone before I leave. Jackie, would you do me a favor and call it? Okay. Awesome. - I'll get the house phone. - No snacks past nine, okay? Can I get a hug? Awesome. So... Why did Xavier have my phone, Opal? He takes things. He took my phone? Yes. That's not good of Xavier. It's time for Xavier to take a timeout. He's a bad bear. Theodora, why don't we go back and go over the list one more time, - and we can chat a little. - Of course. Okay, we've planted the seed. So far, it looks like Theodora's taking the bait. I can see what you guys are talking about, as far as Xavier and everything. How she's projecting it and taking it very hard. I think the best way to handle it is by, you know, refocusing, readjusting... - But, Xavier is going, right? - Yes, Xavier is going. So, hopefully, after tonight, that won't transfer to something else. - She likes you. - Yeah? Oh my gosh, she likes you a lot! All right, guys. Bye! Wish me luck! - Have so much fun! Okay. - Good luck! So, let's see... Okay. - Two boxes of clothes. - Boxes of clothes. Box of gym clothes. Now that... - Jesus Christ. - Was that Opal? Opal? Hi! Oh. Xavier did it. I thought he was in timeout. - He doesn't like to be in timeout. - All right, I'll clean this up. Your mom doesn't need to know about what Xavier did. Let's tell her about the teddy bear. Do you want me to tell you the story about Xavier? - Yeah, of course. - When we moved in to the house, we found him in the room that would become my sister's room. Xavier got mad at my sister when she decided she needed to give up some things and tried to move Xavier out of the house. That's when Xavier started acting... bad. We used to have a dog. Xavier just didn't like the dog. You see what I'm saying? See, right out there on that balcony? That's where my sister... ended. Because Xavier wanted it that way. So, looks like Xavier's... not too good of a teddy bear, is he? No. You seem nice. I don't want anything bad to happen to you. So, make sure nothing bad happens to Xavier. Or else this is the last time we'll ever play together. Cut back to Vertiz! - We're here. - All right, they're pulling up. We're meeting another guy named Alex. - Okay. - Hold on. Alex! - Yeah. - Oh, Alex is out here. All right. - Hey, how you doing? - Alex, nice to meet you. - VJ. - What up, VJ? Let's join forces. Bring Theodora and Vertiz together now. Um, could you come with me for a second? Of course! - Will you be back? - Yeah! I'll be right back. Hi. - Hi, how you doing? - Hi, how are you? All right, this is it, guys, this is where Theodora and Vertiz collide. This is Theodora. If you want to go over this, because I know Sherry wanted you to be in charge of the list. This is VJ. - VJ? - Yes, VJ. Nice to meet you. We'd like to thank you for choosing Pick Me Up, where your donations are going to be really helpful picking a child up. - Thank you. - May I ask you the reason for the donation - of all the items tonight? - Just a charitable donation. We recently heard on the news that there was an incident that happened over here not so long ago. I just want to make sure that everything is okay, you guys were okay, or... - Um... - It's fine, you can tell them. I have no... I'm so sorry, I don't know. I just get positioned in certain houses, so... - And... - Yeah, she's dead. The girl's dead, so... Thanks for asking. We're donating her dolls. The girl is dead, and these are her dolls, so... - Sorry about that. - No worries. You didn't do it. Um... So let me see your list real quick. - Yes. - Yeah. These last items, we're going to get from the little girl's room. This is perfect. They're working together. Let's take them into Opal's room. Just follow me this way. - Hello! - Hi. They're going to come and grab some toys for some kids that really need them. We heard there was a nice teddy bear here that we wanted to check out, if that's okay with you guys. No. Did you tell them what will happen if the bear leaves? Um... If the bear leaves the house, there's nothing I can do to save any of you. What's that? Let's take the bear, guys. - I think we should take the bear. - Jackie... Um, we do already have a lot of stuff for the bear in a really comfortable spot. I'm not saying no because I want to keep him, I'm saying no because I want to protect you. Okay. Oh, so the bear just told me that he wanted to leave, so... - Jackie... - No one... - The bear cannot leave the house. - Except for that the bear has to leave. He doesn't like you as it is. You know what happened to my sister, also. - Hey, could you take the bear? - Yeah, go ahead. - You want me to grab him? - Yeah. First, I'm just going to talk to the bear, see what he says. Hi, Xavier. I was just wondering if you wanted to come back with me. - He said "I wanna leave." - Thank you. He won't like that. Okay. Bye, stupid bear. Uh... I pretty much got the scariest thing out the room. - That's it? - Let's put this in a bag. Tie it up, tie it up. Put it in this box. Yeah, let's definitely... Okay, now we've got to get Theodora downstairs with Vertiz. So... Why don't you go with them, help them finish up. I'll get her ready for bed. Okay, okay. All right, it's all been leading up to this. Get ready, everybody. Get ready. I got the box of dresses which we already went over, - as well as the pillows. - Yep. Okay. - And as far as we did have the teddy bear. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, and the llama as well. Okay. So, right here on this list, I just have the convertible and... Where is the teddy bear? He was in a box. He was sitting right there. - You brought the teddy bear here? - Yeah. And you put it here? In the bag, that bag. That's the bag we put it in and you put it in that box. Am I right? Everyone's seen me when I did it. That's where it was. Okay. Uh... Okay, let's go, let's go. Hey. Where's Jackie? Where is Jackie? - Okay. - He did it again. Will you please sit down? Will you please sit down? - I'll figure this out. Sit down. - No. Please, sir, I don't know you. Sit with me. Please. Sir, call 911. I need the two of you to come out here. No. Stop. - Go get your phone. Now. - VJ, come here. Please get your phone. Please! - I'm not... - Please, please. Please, I'm begging you. Are you afraid of me? No. You... I'm not afraid of you at all. Hold on, hold on. Hey! Okay, stay there, I'm going to call the police. - Hey, VJ? - Give me just a second. Hold on. - Hey, VJ. - Hold on. - Hey. - Hold on. - Hey. Hey, what's going on? - Can we talk about this for a second? - What's up? - Can we talk about this for a second? I'm sorry but I have no experience in... working with... That's fine. I need you to stay with me, though. I can't have you out here. - Are you hurting? - No. Okay. I'm just very nervous for the sake of everyone who's here. - We're going to do this together. - I just... Come on! Pick Me Ups, man! - We are, you're right. - We're supposed to have fun. Pick Me Ups! Come on. Okay. Go check in the back. Okay, I got him. He's back. Okay. I apologize about that. I'm sorry. - I need you to come sit next to me. - All right. Please come sit next to us. You want me to come sit next to you? Okay. That's fine. I'm sorry. This is just... - Yeah. - Okay. - Did you call the police? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's your name? Are they coming? They said they were busy. They're on their way, I think. They told me they'd call me back. Xavier pushed Jackie off the balcony. What?! Okay. Where is she? Oh my God! Hey, Alex? Alex, would you just... - Okay... - Oh my God! So I just saw Jackie. I told you! Xavier pushed her off! The teddy bear! Guys, I don't know the address. I don't know where I'm at. - I need you to call the police. - You don't know where you are? I'm staffed by a third-party staffing agency. All right, here's my plan. Alex is going to watch over Jackie, and that's as far as I've gotten. Where is the teddy bear? The teddy bear pushed her sister off the balcony. Okay? The teddy bear can't leave this house. All right? He's going to stay here. But what we're going to do is we're going to call someone for help. - I don't have my phone on me. - No. You can't call 911 with a story like this, - they'll never believe you! - I'm sorry, yeah, how... how exactly the teddy bear that we just picked up... - Xavier, correct? - Yes. That is... Cursed. Mama? - Mama? - Fuck! - You're not Mama! - Oh my God! Go away! - Oh my God! - Oh my gosh! Get off me! Oh my God! That bear! You're not Mama. - Guys? - All right, hold on. - Give me the phone. - No! Give me the phone! That bear is moving! I know, I know, I know, all right. - Give me the phone, sir! - No. No. That bear was bagged up! Why is that bear up there moving? - No, no, no. Look, hold on... - Stop it, sir! I need my phone! All right, I gotta head in. Things are getting out of control. - Somebody please! - I need the phone. - Please just calm down! - I need my phone. - Guys, listen to me! - What? That bear moves, too. - What? - You need to listen to me. - Help me here. - What? Why are there bears moving? Guys! - You're not Mama. Go away! - Oh, hell, no! Oh, hell, no! Go away! - Go away! - I will kick you, dude. Back off! - Go away! - No! No! No, no! - You're not Mama! - Guys! Opal, here. Everyone sit down for a sec, okay? - That thing is looking at me! - I know! It's okay, let's sit down. What the hell is wrong with you people?! - We're good, okay? - Mama! Sit down. Theodora, do you know who I am? - Ga... Gaten? - Yeah. I'm Gaten. Gaten! Now I'm going to explain what I'm doing here, okay? This is my show! This is called Prank Encounters on Netflix. This is a prank show. Y'all... Y'all are... No! This is not a prank show. And you two are together on this prank show. Guys, no! Oh, no. I know. These are actors. - These things are moving! - Actors! Are you serious?! Are you serious? Sit down. So we have hidden cameras all around here. We do. These mirrors are actually fake and there are cameras in there. I don't even know... - I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! - Y'all are so serious! Do you guys know each other? Him? - No, I've never... - Would it surprise you to know that you're the only two here that are not in on this? I thought she was. I thought everyone was in on it. I thought you were in on this, too! I was like, "I'm not sitting next to you!" Oh, you thought she was in on it? I was like, "I'm not sitting next to any of you!" I thought this was a huge cult and you guys were going to kill me. I was about to punch him in the face. Yeah, I was this close! What did you think when you saw Alex get pushed over the balcony there? I was like, "Oh, hell, no." I was trying to find an escape plan so bad! Yes! I didn't know where to go! I wasn't going to go past you! Wow, you guys are absolutely crazy. - We're insane. - You're a good person. I would like a hug. Just so we can make amends. Just so we could...
