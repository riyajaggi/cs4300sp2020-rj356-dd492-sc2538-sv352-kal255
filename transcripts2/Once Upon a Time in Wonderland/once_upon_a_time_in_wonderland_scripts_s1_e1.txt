 You are never going to believe where I've been! Alice... It all began with this white rabbit, - and he wanted to take my hat and then... - Alice? Is that really you? Who else would I be? You were gone a very long time. We... we thought you were... you thought I was what? Dead. (Man, faintly) White rabbits, smoking caterpillars? Giant mushrooms? Who does she think I am, a fool? Why would she lie? (Man) Your child is delusional.

 She's delusional. She's making it up. But I can cure her of this. So she's a liar. She is a liar. I'm not a liar. It was real. And I'm going to prove it. Once Upon a Time in Wonderland S01E01 "Down the Rabbit Hole" Sync by Gianluca Belfiglio, corrected by atrn97g www.addic7ed.com (Dogs barking in distance, wind whistling) (Thunder crashing) (Horn blares) (Tires screech) Looks like you closed down the joint again, Leroy. (Thunderclap) You're really gunning for that customer of the week plaque. (Keys jangle) It's a win/win, Ashley. You get my mug on the wall, - I finally get... whoa! - Sorry, brother. Closing time. It looks like a storm's coming. You better find a place to keep dry. (Thunder crashing) (British accent) I'll get right on that. (Jangles) (Thunder crashing in distance) (Bill rustles) (Slurps) (Rattling) (Rumbling) (Loud whirring) (Explosion) (Clattering) (Grunting and coughing) (Flaps lips) There you are. Bloody hell! What are you doing here? I'll tell you on the way. We're late. No, I'm not interested in your important dates, Rabbit, or your unimportant dates, for that matter. No, no, no, no. We're not late for something. We're late for someone. Who? Alice. She needs help. You're the Knave of hearts. She needs you. (Man cackling in distance) (Grunting) Answer the question, please. Alice? Alice? I don't remember. Oh, I think you do. It's been a year now, and you've been quite clear in your statements. An invisible cat, a hookah-smoking caterpillar, food and drink capable of altering your physical form, a murderous red queen. And you encountered all these things by literally... falling down a rabbit hole. Hearing it out loud, it all sounds quite... preposterous. Wouldn't you agree, Alice? Yes. Good. Just a few more questions, and maybe this time, we can send you home. When your father finally brought you to us, he was at his wit's end. It wasn't just your multiple disappearances that had taken a toll. It was your ludicrous explanation that you'd been searching for proof of this place, this... Wonderland where you had miraculous, strange, and terrifying adventures. Do you still believe that to be true? (Bubbling sound) (Exhaling) (Gagging and coughing) Hey, that's mine. Give it back. (Siren wailing) (Man) Trespassers! Halt! She's headed into the maze! By order of the Queen, stop! Don't let her get away! (Grunts) (Man) She's headed for the Queen's garden! (Dog howls in distance) After her! (Man) I thought she went this way! She mustn't get away! (Man, slow-motion voice) Where's the girl? Has anyone seen her? (Loud stomping) I thought she went this way! (Gasps) (Man) Alice? (Singsongy) Alice? (Pounding desk) (Normal voice) Alice! No. It wasn't true. I never left England. So you just... made it all up? Why? For attention? Well, you certainly got it, didn't you? The question we have to answer today is which is the real performance... little girl with tales of tea parties and barbaric queens, or the young lady who says it was just her imagination? That little girl was a fool. And the lady? She knows what really happened. (Loud stomping) (Man) Search everywhere! (Stomping continues) (Slow-motion voice) She has to be here somewhere. There's nowhere left! Don't let her get by. Where did she go? (Grunting) (Man shouting indistinctly in slow-motion voice) (Man) What are you doing in my bottle? (Gasps) Turn me in, and I get big. Right here, right now, burst your house into a million shiny pieces. We wouldn't want that now, would we? Good bottles are so hard to find these days. (Chuckles) My name is Cyrus. My home is your home. (Doctor) When you finally resurfaced, you claimed to be in this... Wonderland. Can you tell us where you really were? With a friend. Where? (Alice) Agrabah sounds beautiful. I hope one day to see it again. What place do you call home? England. Although it hasn't exactly felt like home lately. So we're both strangers in this most strange land. "Strange" is one word for it. Wondrous? Dangerous. I sense that you can take care of yourself. (Chuckles) And you have to go back to your land soon? Well, I do have what I came for. Which is what? Proof that all this is real. (Muffled grunting) (Muffled sputtering) Oh! You want proof? Come here. I'll give you proof. Uhh! A talking white rabbit in jacket and trousers? (Sighs) No one can say I imagined that. Yes. That much is certain. So tell me, Alice, who is this proof for? You've risked much to come back here. Is it... a husband? No. There's no one like that. Good. Good? I mean, just that you're not separated from your love. That'd be a terrible fate. Yes. That it would. The proof is for my father. He thinks I'm insane. Really? So you're risking your life for someone who doesn't believe in you? You know... When you really love someone, you don't need proof. You can feel it. Maybe where you're from, but in my land, I wish things would... You wish things would what? You found my bottle, Alice. Anything is possible. "Mistress mine," "my will is thine." "Tell me your wishes three." Alice, if you wish to be released from this facility, - you need to... - I don't wish for anything! Would... this have something to do with the genie you believe you met? You told your father that you... you set him free, that the two of you traveled from world to world, fighting pirates, swimming with mermaids. And then... Men and women being what they are, you fell in love. Are you ready to admit that that was a lie as well? (Water gurgling) Curiouser and curiouser. I've heard of the boiling sea, but in person, it's even more amazing. As are you. Oh! Careful. (Gasps) (Both chuckle) I've never met a human quite like you, Alice. I've never met a genie quite like you. Well, actually, I've never met a genie, so... (Chuckles) Okay. Forgive me. I'm not used to... I was always the one granting the wishes, not making them. Making them? What? For 100 years, I was tethered to a bottle, a slave to the faulty dreams of man, and all that time, I only had one wish... to never be a prisoner again. And now... I have another. Wait. I... I think the people in you world do this down on one... Yes. What? Yes, yes, I will. No, but I had a whole speech. It was charming and eloquent and had... Our hearts are entwined. From now on, I'll know when you are near, and you will know. (Feet marching in distance) (Marching grows louder) Alice, run! When your father found you, you were inconsolable. You said the love of your life was gone, murdered by some... No, that's... that's not what I said. Alice, you were an ignored little girl who wanted to be loved, so you created a fantasy land full of characters who'd help you become who you wanted to be... tall, brave, beautiful. You wouldn't be the first child to do this. You're just the first to grow up and still believe it was real. (Whispers) No. (Normal voice) I don't believe it anymore. We know you're lying. You still cry out for him in your sleep. - What? - In your sleep. Every night, it's the same. You cry out for Cyrus. (Blade zings) (Blades zing) Sorry to interrupt. (Blade zings) (Clanking) (Grunting) Mind if I borrow him? Cyrus, no! Cyrus! (Grunts) Alice! (Grunts) (Grunting) (Clank) Oops. (Alice) Cyrus! Cyrus! No! Cyrus. (Doctor) Alice? We have a new procedure that can take away your pain. Make you forget whatever... Or whomever you're holding on to. One treatment. It all just... slips away. Does it hurt? A little. But far less than the pain you're in right now. (Footsteps) Just sign here. Good girl. Now go get some sleep. Tomorrow your life begins anew. (Bell clanging, horse whinnies in distance) (Whispers) Cyrus. (Squeaking and whirring) It's time. Fetch the girl. (Whirring and thudding in distance) (Door unlocks) Could you at least give me time to get dressed? You. "You"? That's what I get? "You"? Well, nice to see you, too, Alice. What are you doing here? Right. Come now. We have to go. Go? Oh, no. You're not real. Oh, I'm very real, and we must leave now. I've cleared out some of the guards, - so we should be able to get out... - No, I can't. I can't. Alice, you need to listen to me. No, I'm not going anywhere. Why must you always be so bloody stubborn? There he is. (Grunting) - I didn't do anything. (Man) - It's true. I mean, if she was the least bit helpful, we would have been long gone by now... ow! Get him out of here. Alice, no! You know me! You remember. - I don't want to remember. I want to forget. - Alice, listen to me. - No! - He's alive. The rabbit saw him. (Grunting) Cyrus. He's alive. That's impossible. You know as well as I do, Alice. (Grunts) Nothing's impossible in Wonderland. (Men grunting) (Blow lands) Uhh! Uhh! (Grunts) (Bone crunches) (Grunting) (Metal clicks) (Grunting) (Man) Aah! (Clank) (Thud) (Thud) Was that your idea of a rescue? Well, it was supposed to be more of a message delivery type situation. I wasn't planning to... Right, let's go then. You're late. What a surprise. To you, everybody's late. True. I do have high standards. Nice world you got here. Oh. What the hell is this stuff? It's pretty hard on the paws. Alice! Stop. Don't do this. I can help you get better. Are we really going to stand here and listen to this guy? Seeing things, doctor? I hear there's a procedure for that. (Door clanking) (Panting) Well, what do we do now? We run. Look out! (Metal clanking) Out of the way! (Clatter) (Whistling) (Man) Out of my way! (White rabbit) Oh, no. We'll be pinched for sure. No, we won't. (Men shouting indistinctly) - They're coming. - Rabbit! Here? Couldn't we find somewhere with softer ground, like a field... (Both) Dig! All right. (Whooshing) Here goes. (Grunts) (Crackling) What are you waiting for?! Alice, I didn't exactly leave that place on good terms. Neither did I, but if Cyrus is... Then you have to go, not me. Listen, Knave. Once long ago, I got you back your heart. Now... you need to help me get back mine. (Man in distance) Down there! Or you can take your chances with them. Bloody hell. All right, then. Next stop... Wonderland! (Whooshing) (Thunder crashing) (Crackling) Uhh! Aah! Humans. I hate... This bloody... Place! (Panting) Careful, Knave. We've landed in the mallow marsh. Of course we did, because a pond made out of dessert topping - makes perfect sense. (White rabbit) - Come on. Shake a leg. (Birds chirping, insect wings flapping) Shake two legs. (Laughs) (Booming sound) (Birds continue chirping) Ugh! What a mess. Okay, Rabbit. Where's Cyrus? Tell us where you saw him. Well, I didn't exactly see him. Did you tell her I saw him? - That is what you said. - It was a figure of speech. Nope. I'm pretty sure it wasn't. Uh, what I meant was, I was having tea with the Dormouse, and he said that he saw him. So we came all the way here on the word of a narcoleptic rodent? (Gurgling sound) Ignore him, Rabbit. Go on. He said Cyrus was at the Mad Hatter's old place. It's abandoned. The Hatter... he hasn't been in Wonderland for quite some time. And he ain't never coming back. He's found himself a nice little life back in the place I was makin' mine... a place, I might add... (Roars) where the dragonflies aren't actually dragons. Rabbit, are you getting taller? Yeah, quite possibly. That kind of thing happens quite a lot around here. We're sinking. (Sloshing) I can't move me feet. Rabbit, where is it? Where's the Hatter's house? Where else? The Tulgey Woods. Knave, we need to get out of here. (Gurgling sound) Really? Uh, everything's gonna be fine. I'll just, uh... uh, uh, I'll go get help! Don't worry! Everything's going to work out just fine! Stop moving. We'll just sink faster. Oh, because a slow death is so much more pleasant. This is humiliating. I'm gonna die like a bloody s'more. A what? It's biscuits and chocolate, and you get toasted marsh... never mind. The point is, we're gonna die. (Panting) (Gurgling sound) Knave, that's brilliant. (Roars) (Screeches) (Roaring) What the bloody hell are you doing? - I'm making a smore. - S'mores! Whatever. I'm starting to think you were in the nutter for a reason. See? (Screeches) Come on. (Grunting) (Birds chirping) Where's that rabbit? It's getting late, and I plan on sleepin' in me own bed tonight. You can't leave. We haven't found Cy... Cyrus. Exactly. You heard what the rabbit said. He never even saw him. (Sighs) If I'd known that, I wouldn't have done any of this. I mean, for all we know, he isn't even alive. What if he is? Alice... I left Wonderland because I did a lot of bad things here. A lot of people wanna see me dead. They have their reasons, and to be honest, they're good reasons. (Sighs) I left this place for a future I'm quite keen to see, and you want me to risk all that for a hunch? I can pay you. How? You don't have anything to pay me, Alice. That's not entirely true. I have something better than money. (Squeaks) Wishes. I don't get it. Why don't you just use 'em to bring Cyrus back? Wishes can be... unpredictable. If I used one to bring Cyrus back, he might arrive hanging from a tree with a noose around his neck. See, with wishes, sometimes there's literally a string attached. Then one just has to be careful what they wish for. Make it consequence-proof. Yeah, I can do that. So does that mean you'll stay? We find Cyrus, I get a wish. Anything I want. Just get me to Tulgey Woods. (Clatter) So you really believe the rabbit, then? I know you have your doubts, but, yes, I believe the rabbit. (Panting) Oh! (Groans) (Horse whinnies in distance) Oh, no. Huh. Oh. - There you are, Rabbit. - Oh! My ears! Oh! Uhh! Do you mind? (Grunts) (Panting) Your Majesty, I can explain. You're late. I know. I know. I... I'm so sorry. I came as soon as I could. So you told Alice what you heard? Yes, that Cyrus was alive. Is he? I'll be the one asking questions. Right. Right. So this makes us all square then? You said if I got her here, I'd get... I said we'd settle up when the game was complete. We are still setting up the board. Now as for your friend Alice, I need you to report everything she does, where she goes, who she talks to, what she is thinking. I need more than my eyes. I need your ears, and you will either help me, darling... Or decorate this room. Understood? Yes, Y... Your Majesty. Now leave. (Chair scrapes floor) (Whimpers) (Insects buzzing, creatures calling in distance) The Tulgey Woods. The Hatter's place is on the other side. Aren't you worried this is all a trap? If there's a chance that Cyrus is alive, we have to take it. Right. Let's go. The Red Queen... you said it was also her who threw Cyrus into the boiling sea. Why would she do that? I don't know, but I'd love to ask her and see the look on her face when she realizes I'm not the forgiving sort, particularly when said face meets this branch, repeatedly. Doesn't sound like you. The doctors said I'm a danger to myself and to others. Yeah, you can't believe everything you read now. I don't. In fact... when I thought Cyrus was dead, I stopped believing in much of anything. (Loud clank) (Whoosh) (Man) Well? She's back. And what is the girl doing now? Looking for her genie, of course. Isn't that what we wanted, Jafar? What we want can't be accomplished until we have the genie's bottle and the girl's made all her wishes. So I'd say perhaps you shouldn't be so pleased with yourself. Do not talk down to me, Jafar. I'm the Queen. That's the thing about power. Hmm. It can be so fleeting. (Scoffs) Is that a threat? No. Threats are for people who aren't prepared to act. (Staff thuds) Wait. You need me. Not anymore. But I did what you could not. I... I brought Alice back to Wonderland. Which means your work and your usefulness to me is done. I'll take it from here. (Whoosh) (Crackling) (Choking) (Crackling) (Weakly) Do you know... (Strained voice) where she is? (Inhales sharply) Do you? (Loud whoosh) (Gasping) (Chuckles) That's right. You don't. Now you're not in Agrabah anymore, darling. This is my world, which means only I know exactly where she is. Only I know exactly where she's going. So if you want my help, yes... our deal remains. I will get you those wishes. In return for what, exactly? All in due time. So why don't you get on that raggedy carpet of yours and fly away? And let me take care of Alice. For your sake... I hope you do. (Alice) We've been walking forever. We should be at the Hatter's house by now. (Insects chirping and buzzing) (Knave) Oh, bloody hell. What exactly did you do after I left? Don't ask. (Parchment rustles) Now which way? Up. I'm tired of wandering around. We need a different point of view. What do you mean? If I get high enough, I can see the Hatter's house. Enough of these. (Grunts) I can see it! The Hatter's place... it's not that far! Knave? Will? (Sighs) (Low growling) (Growling) Cheshire. It's you. You gave me a fright. (Continues growling) Chesh? You remember me, right? It's Alice. Yes, I remember. You look... different. Everything does, doesn't it? Wonderland has grown stranger. I'm stranger. You're stranger. Together we are... strangers. Well, then... how do you do? Now that we're friends again, you wouldn't want to eat a friend now... Would you? Mmm, certainly not without pepper. (Gasps) The pickings are slimmer these days. These woods used to be full of food, but now the only thing it's full of... Is you. (Growls) Aah! Aah! (Exhales) (Growling) (Grunts) (Whack) (Panting) (Growling) (Grunts) The Red Queen promised you would be the sweetest meat I've ever tasted. Let's see, shall we? (Gasps) (Continues growling) (Roars and screeches) (Growling) Oi! (Growling) (Meows) Now then... Go pick on somebody your own size. (Meows) I can't believe it. You. You were... Brave? Daring? ...Stealing my wishes. Oh, that. I think maybe you misunderstand. I was just protecting the wishes. You expect me to believe that? Not really, no. But can we focus on the part where I came back and saved your life? You know you can't steal a wish. It has to be granted. Of course I did. Everybody knows that. Let's go get Cyrus. Knave. (Panting) Over there! Hurry! Cyrus?! (Exhales deeply) (Panting) The Hatter's house. Cyrus. Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus. I'm here. Alice. He must be here. It's too dark to tell, or maybe he's sleeping or something. (Door opens) Oh, here you are. I've been looking all over. I showed up with a whole troop to pull you out of that marsh, but you were gone. It's okay, Rabbit. Just dig us back home. Cyrus ain't here. No, he must be here. (Sighs) Alice... Alice. I'm sorry. But he's not here. And as far as I can tell, he never was. Maybe... Maybe the Dormouse just named the wrong house, or... Rabbit, enough. If Cyrus were here, wouldn't he have shown himself by now? So he really is gone. Alice. (Huffs) You made her lose Cyrus twice. Why would you do that? (Alice) Will, Rabbit, come quickly! (Gasps) I found this. It was Cyrus's. Where did you get that? It was just here in the grass. He's alive. Nothing could survive the boiling sea. If it survived, so did he. Alice, that necklace... it's magic. That's why it survived. The guy wearing it... he was just flesh and blood. He's gone. I'm sorry. Now let's get out of here. The rabbit can dig his hole. You can make a new life, meet somebody else. - No. - No? I'm not going. Alice, this isn't the time to be stubborn. I'm not being stubborn. Yes, you are. If you want to leave, leave. But I'm staying. Because of a necklace? Because he's here. But you have no proof. When you really love someone, you don't need proof. You can feel it. He's here. I'm gonna find him. Only question is... Are you coming with me? I was afraid you were going to ask me that. Is that a "yes"? (Sighs) Bloody hell. Come on then. (Whooshes) (Whispers) Alice. (Clanking in distance) No! (Jafar speaks indistinctly) Sync by Gianluca Belfiglio, corrected by atrn97g www.addic7ed.com www.NapiProjekt.pl - nowa jako?? napis?w.
