[ techno music plays ] lt is my goal to drive my car the fastest, using all the RPMs at my disposal and cross the finish line before the other cars, which will result in me winning many races, mm? Hey, Mr. Racer, have you lined up any corporate sponsorships? As a matter of fact, l've lined up Japan's most popular animé series to sponsor my car. [ all gasp ] The English translation of the series is ''Many-Tentacled Rapists from Hell Conquer the lnnocence of Schoolgirls,'' and, as you can see, the production values are extremely high. Ho-ho-ho. [ sproing! ] Oh, no! Speed, come quick! [ gasps ] l thought southern intolerance was a thing of the past. Folks, hey, this isn't a hate cross. lt's a welcome cross. Wow, this particular gift basket contains a wide selection of Omaha Steaks, plus a $50 gift certificate to Best Buy. Ahhh. Hey, l never got a welcome cross. And the Mach 5 makes an early push using a debatably legal tactic. Speed, those must be the jewel thieves that stole the Daytona 500 diamond. [ laughs evilly ] This calls for a little creative driving. [ engine revving, crowd shouting ] Oh, my! Gonna have to check the rule book on that maneuver, race fans. Don't worry, Speed. Help is on the way -- from a mysterious ally. Hey, everybody, give Speed Racer's secret brother some room. Go help your secret brother, Racer X. Boy, l wish l had a secret brother like Racer X. Those drivers are persistent, but they are certainly no match for the Mach 5. [ laughs ] Whoa! Not sure that oil-slick dispenser is NASCAR regulation, folks. Good God! Sir! Sir! The TV ratings are in! Hot damn! Viewership has tripled! [ sproing! ] - Yay, Speed! - Oh, yeah! Hurray for Speed! - We did it -- first place! - Hurray, Speed! Say, where are Spritle and Chim Chim? Ho-ho-ho! Those scamps are probably stowed away in the Mach 5 again. BOTH: Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! ALL: [ gasp ] Uh... someone get a hose and a garbage bag. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. - Goodbye, Dorothy. - Bye, Dorothy! - We'll miss you. - So long! [ twinkle! ] ls that Kansas skank gone? Sweet! Back to business as usual. But why? Ohh, remember when l said l was a very bad wizard? Well, case in point. Oh! l'll just take that brain back. Aah! Aah! [ clank! ] Hmm. [ munch! ] Mmm! Mmm! Oh, but my courage is more of a concept, really. Aah! Yep. [ sighs ] lt's good to be the wizard. Sir, Glinda the Good Witch is here. Ahh, bring me my rape shoes. l want to be just like daddy. [ crying ] Whoo! Yeah! Previously on ''The Hills,'' Heidi tried to apologize, but l wasn't ready to forgive her. lt's hard to say you're sorry. You're sorry. See, l just said it.
