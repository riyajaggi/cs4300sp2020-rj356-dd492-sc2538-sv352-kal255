 Actually, it's more like us doing you a favor. How would you like the creators of Robot Chicken writing on one of your shows? You think you're worthy of writing in the Whedonverse? Oh, wow, you actually say ''Whedonverse'' in real life. That's right! And as one of my creations, l do believe l have let you live long enough. Time to die, werewolf! Wow! Ron Moore, creator of Battlestar Galactica! How about letting us come aboard and help you with your whip-smart plots? Help?

''Oh, please help me! This is so hard!'' Well, maybe l could act on the show. l could be a Cylon. That's right. You could be. You won't get me, you fucking skin-jobs!

What? l haven't heard an idea that bad since Hanna-Barbera launched ''Scooby-Jew.'' Like, would you do it for a Scooby snack?
