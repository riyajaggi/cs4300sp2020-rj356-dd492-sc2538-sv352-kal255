 Previously on "L.A.'s Finest"... [Gunshots] Our victim over here is Lonnie Emmons, 35 years old. - Shot in the back three times. - Lonnie was a good man. I don't know why anyone would want to hurt him. Any idea how much was stolen? Roughly $10 million in untraceable raw uncut diamonds and jewels. We caught a homicide case this morning that might have something to do with this job. I'm setting up a Gabriel Knox task force - and I want you on the team. - Warren is not my boyfriend.

 - Were you with him when... - The baby was his. Does he know? Yeah, but you need to know this stuff, first-time dad. What? Congrats! That's great! I know how it looks. - You have to understand... - Looks like my product might be better served with a different distributor. - These are minor setbacks. - Dan Howser said that you could be trusted. When I start digging, I might find things that could be as damaging to your wife as they are to Dante. I told him not to call, but you know Ray. It's time I gotta be more like Ray. I know why you here, but I am gonna do whatever it takes

 - and you need to make sure I make bail. - I came here to help. What did you... what did you do? Doing what I need to do to protect my family. Get on the ground! Don't move! Let's go. Dante Sherman, who is he to you? I'll tell you everything, but right now I need you to help me dig up a body. ♪ NICO: Leave her alone! You're hurting her! What kind of mother are you? - You're a drunk! - Stop it, Mama! - You're pathetic! - Please! NANCY: All I wanted was to get that money, grab Nico, and get the hell out of there. [Gunshot] [Gunshot] My ears were still ringing when I called Dante. I'm so sorry, McKenna. Him and Ray picked us up. We drove out here and... buried the body. So, that's why you owe him. ♪ We all swore to keep it a secret. ♪ Now Dante's threatening to tell. So, if we dig up the evidence, then he has no proof. Yeah. So no more protecting Dante? ♪ I'm here for you. Okay? I mean, I'm not thrilled about the whole digging-up-of-the-dead-body, uh, part of the program, but I will somehow muddle my way through. - You're a wuss. - I am. ♪ That's him. You must be Syd. Here to help. I don't know why you told her. He looks just like you. He looks like her. [Sighs] Man, this is gonna take forever. ♪ ♪ Tell da universe and ull get it, zooma zoom zoom ♪ Yo, there's a good chance our perp's got the diamonds on him. He tried to fence them about an hour ago. - You sure he's here? - That's the intel I got from Commercial Crimes. His street name is "The Mouth." He's got a messed-up haircut, talks a lot of trash, and he thinks he can play basketball. That could be you. Ha, ha, ha. Look at this clean line, baby. If anything, those precious little curls you got - could use a comb. - Oh, okay. It's a little Westbrook curry, a special dish I made just for you. Are you hungry? [Grunting] - Oh! - Oh! Oh! Ah! Oh, my God! Ah! Man, that is a foul! You gonna foul a brother like that? - Come on. - Yeah, yeah, that's a'ight, though. Man... Oh-ho! - What's up, peanut head? - [Laughs] You got next? You gotta do what you gotta do. - Let's go. - [Chuckling] Oh! Oh, this is not gonna be pretty. Check ball. - You got a name? - [Chuckles] I got a name, and I got a game. And it's Dakari Adams. And you gonna remember it after this, baby. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Ah, oh, oh, yeah. Oh, let's get it! Ah! Ah! Come on, man!

Heard you been trying to fence some diamonds. W... well, you heard wrong. Who lied on me like that? Baby mama. Let's go. You know you fouled me, right? You was all over me. Hey, Officer Peanut. I can smell what you ate for dinner last night. Chicken. That's how foul it was. ♪ Tell me what you wanna do 'cause baby I am wanting you ♪ This isn't right. What? ♪ Take Nico back to the car, Nance. No, I want him with me. He shouldn't be here. Go with him. We got this. Alright. - Hurry. Okay? - Yeah. ♪ We weren't here. What are you talking about? We were standing right over there. Haven't forgot about that night, Nance, and I never will. Yeah, we were standing right over there before we went into the car. Don't you remember? Ray and Dante are the ones that buried the body, not us. Okay, so it's gonna take a little longer. We'll find it. No. Let's just go. This is... We're already here. Let's just find her and get it over with. Our mother ruined our lives, and now she's doing it from the grave. - This has got to stop. - Yeah, I thought that's why we were here. Look at us. This is crazy. There is no way we're gonna find it. What do you want to do, McKenna? ♪ Damn it. Damn it! ♪ Raw diamond. No luck fencing this? BAINES: Ain't talkin' smack now, huh? I ain't never seen it before. It was in your pocket, Dakari, and it was stolen a couple days ago. You having trouble solving your case? - [Chuckling] - Yeah, that's funny. - Alright, let's lock him up. - No, no, no, no, no. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Now, Dakari, you... you know this... this diamond heist was all over the news, right? If we make this arrest, we're heroes. You sure you want to go to jail for a crime you didn't commit? Oh, I see. Is it your day to play the good cop? - Is today my day? - Yeah, it is. Oh, well, in that case, listen, man. I appreciate your love for basketball, even though you have on a volleyball suit. Lakers. I can't go to the game tomorrow night, but I'm willing to give you this ticket for a little bit of information. - Laker tickets? - I'm giving him a Laker ticket. As you serious? As a heart attack. You gonna give me that ticket? - I can't go. - He can't go. You not playin' with me? I've seen him play, and he is definitely not playing when he busts out the Llaker tickets. Y'all trying to trap me? It's my ticket. It's his ticket. He can do what he wants with it. Wha... no, man. No. This don't even smell right. You don't even have to go to concessions. They come to you. Like, right there. The people come up there and say, "would you like anything, volleyball suit?" You be like, "yeah, let me get some popcorn, milk duds, and hurry up. I'm watching LeBron." And they're free. ♪ - Right, man. If you don't... - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait. Look. ♪ It's a dude named Romeo. ♪ He came to the court 'cause he heard I had connections. He was desperate. ♪ - Desperate how? - Man, I don't know. Okay, look. I paid 500 for the diamond. It's worth at least twice that. Then this dude tried to sell me his car, his business, and even his cellphone. What kind of car was it? I don't know. I didn't ask. What does he look like? He was skinny. White guy. Smelled funny. It kind of was like a old man aftershave, which didn't make sense 'cause he was scruffy. Look, how'd he get connected with you? I didn't ask. - You gonna see him again? - I'mma be busy. At a Lakers game. Enjoy. [Laughing] My boy, LeBron! Let's get it... Hey, wait a minute, man. This game was from last week, man! Oh, see that's the part you was covering up with your damn fingers! - That's black-on-black crime! - Actually feel bad for him. He had his heart set on going to that game. Man, you should feel bad for me. I'm the one who had to work and missed it. Uh, yeah. Thanks for letting us know. Dante Sherman escaped. ♪ We were the booking officers on the arrest, so we were notified. Someone made a fake 911 call claiming an officer was shot. So, they diverted the escort vehicle, and the ambulance was hijacked at gunpoint. Was anyone hurt? Just two EMTs and an officer were roughed up, but nothing serious. BAINES: Look, Nance, I gotta keep it 100 with you... You asked me and Walker to make the arrest, but I know you've got history with this guy. I have no idea where Dante is. I had nothing to do with this. ♪ No, uh, Syd. McKenna was the last person with Sherman in lockup before he went to the hospital. She knows anything else, she's gotta tell us. ♪ - Now what? - I have a confession to make. - Do I want to hear this? - No. You're a cop, and I'm gonna confess to an assault. I'm your partner and your friend, and you're gonna be faced with the dilemma of what to do. Don't tell me. - I poisoned Dante. - Jesus. I was trying to buy some time, you know, to dig up the past. You are killing me, McKenna. Jesus. I'm the one who rigs the the rules. - I know. - Okay, okay, okay. So, he's just out there, and you have no idea what his next move is. I mean... I don't think Dante escaped. He had no idea he was gonna be going to the hospital at that time. Someone broke him out. Okay, so someone who knew that he was being transported by ambulance, knew the exact route, and knew that the only way to divert an escort would be to call in an officer shooting. Who would do that? Unfortunately, McKenna, outside of Gabriel Knox, your ass would be my next suspect. ♪ I mean, I look pretty guilty right now. Yeah, you do. Dante Sherman is a fugitive. LAPD in conjunction with LA county sheriff's department continues their search and asks that Mr. Sherman turns himself in to authorities immediately. I want to be clear... Anyone caught helping Mr. Sherman flee will be prosecuted as a felon. My office will keep you updated with any new information. Press conference is scheduled for this afternoon. MAN: Have you determined who made that phony 911 call? Why was the suspect being taken to the hospital? WOMAN: Is there a possibility that he fled the state? We understand your wife, Detective McKenna, was with the suspect right before he was loaded into the ambulance. Yes, what's LAPD's involvement? Again, we'll answer your questions as we learn more. My office will keep you updated with any new information. [All murmuring indistinctly] I'll catch up. ♪ _ ... and ask that Mr. Sherman turns himself in to authorities immediately. Anyone caught helping Mr. Sherman will be prosecuted as a felon. - My office will keep you...  - Listen up. Our Santa Monica sniper, Anatoly Petrov, gave up some intel that we've just confirmed. Our target is Bishop Duvall. He's a new supplier of fentanyl in LA. He also like to play. And everything he does, he does big. Drugs will be coming from Mexico and China. And a small shipment will be at a cocktail party he's throwing tonight. There's a chance Gabriel Knox will attend. - WALKER: That's a big takedown. - BAINES: But how are we gonna arrest somebody that we can't identify? What we do know is that there gonna be some major players in the room looking to audition to distribute Duvall's drug. So we're gonna have to be sharp. You mean we're gonna have to get lucky. Yes. We've got a low-level narc on the inside. He secured invitations for McKenna, Burnett, Baines, Walker, and DEA Agent Hendrix. We'll be going undercover as guests. Pay attention to the dress code. We want to blend in. Talking to you, Baines. [Laughter] Uh, why you throwing shade, Calloway, with the Ricky Martin shirt? Nobody in here flosses more than me. SYD: Yeah, but you gonna have to update - that 1992 Boyz II Men tuxedo, though. - Ohh. ♪ I'll make love to you ♪ - ♪ Like you want me to ♪ - Oh, yeah. We saw it. Yeah, you must have been saving that one. Okay, back to it. Our tactical advance team will locate and confirm the presence of narcotics on the premises. Our undercover team will ghost the main players until we can get them in the same room as the package. That's when we make our arrest. Study your packets. We'll brief and TAC up at 1700. McKenna looks distracted. Is your girl gonna be okay on this? Yeah. McKenna's always on her game. She needs to be. 'Cause this Duvall guy is known to be unpredictable. Yeah, he's also a showoff. He probably thinks he's untouchable. That'll be his weakness. What? You're just... you're fearless. No. I'm motivated, and one step closer to Knox. I hope so, Syd. For you. ♪ I miss you. ♪ NANCY: Hey. Nico. Can't be good news. Have you talked to Dante? No. I'm gonna tell Patrick everything. Man, whatever. You do what you gotta do. I'll take care of myself. No. I'm gonna take care of it. Look, I know you're scared. I'm scared, too. But I promise, I will not let anything bad happen to either one of us. You think because you have a badge and a lawyer husband, that if we explain everything, it'll be all good? - Yeah, I do. - The bruises are gone. We're not little kids anymore with black eyes and bloody noses. The scars from the cigarette burns... They're faded. Nobody's gonna have sympathy for us. We'll tell them what happened. We'll tell them how often she abused us. What our lives were like. It's not gonna matter. All they're thinking about is that she's not here to tell her side of the story. ♪ I gotta go. I'm working. ♪ Don't worry. It'll be okay. Why did you try to save her? [Fence clinking] ♪ Alright. It's over. No one talks about this. Ever. It never happened. Nico? - You hear me? - Yeah. Let's go. ♪ Come on. Sorry to keep you waiting. News this morning was quite a surprise. Dante Sherman on the front page. I don't have a lot of time, Carlene. You have any more information on Sherman? What do you know about your wife's mother? Well, she took off when she was a teenager. Went back to Texas. Is that what your wife told you? I... I ask because I gathered evidence that suggests foul play. It doesn't look like Rosa Perez ever left California. She just vanished. That can't be right. Irregular credit card activity. Appointments made and canceled. Rosa's signature forged on documents. All reflect a distinct and uncharacteristic change in Rosa's behavior in and around June of 1999. - Stolen identity? - Or someone wanted to make it look like she was still alive. ♪ You think Dante Sherman has something to do with this? He could have. But the forged signatures are consistent with a female's handwriting. Gender identity determined by handwriting is rarely admissible in court. True. However, I could reach out to some experts if you'd like... No. No. Thank you. I may be wrong about this, Patrick. Yeah, I think you are. You know, I have to go. But I'd appreciate it if you can forward these documents to me. If I have any questions, I'll give you a call. Of course. ♪ Carlene. Thank you, but I won't need anything else. ♪ [Door shuts] One cup of coffee. That's all a brother asks. You got one job. One job. - Baines. - Hey, man, we... we are highly skilled crime fighters. A working coffee maker is not too much to ask. I can't even... This is crazy. Dude, just plug it in. - That's it. - Oh, wow. Somebody got jokes. Alright, who got jokes? Huh? Who's playing games? Baines. Hey. Hold up. Uh... Did your wife tell you everything about her pregnancies? What do you mean? Uh, Michelle went to the doctor yesterday. She was spotting. She didn't even call me. Well, did she tell you when you got home? Mm-hmm. You had two miscarriages, man. Michelle didn't want you to worry. She's good, and the baby's good, right? Yeah. Don't stress. You want to know the secret to a smooth pregnancy? Pig's feet. Eat 'em straight out the jar. - Ugh. - Takes care of everything. - I'm telling you. - No, I'm not gonna tell her to eat that. Man, listen... all my kids were born on time, healthy, speaking two languages. Marisol Emmons is on her way up. Hey, man. Portuguese ain't easy. Do you know a man named Romeo? Yeah. Yeah, Tony goes by Romeo. I always just called him Tony, though. That's how he introduced himself to me. Tony Smith. He and Lonnie and a buncha guys would play poker every other Thursday. A home address? Work place? No. Uh, when was the last time you saw him? Um, he came by to pay his respects after what happened to Lonnie. Uh... Did he... do this? Is that why you're asking? Did he kill Lonnie? Was he standing in my house pretending to be a friend, and he... he might be the killer? Mrs. Emmons, we don't know that. We're just trying to find him. We believe your husband may have been involved in a heist at the diamond reserve. - Possibly with Romeo. - Huh. It's always the cleaning crew, huh? Our company had a contract with the reserve for the past 10 years. They trusted us.

I can hear you, Syd. The coms are on. I'm just saying, you didn't have all that booty yesterday. - Payback's coming. - It's cute, though. CALLOWAY: TAC team is on the premises. ♪ MAN: Perimeter is secure. Searching for the contraband. ♪ Ooh, this is gonna be fun. - 10:00. Gray suit. - Okay.

CALLOWAY: We're on duty, ladies. Yep. ♪ Duvall has left the dance floor, folks. CALLOWAY: To Duvall's left is Evan Lau, Koreatown territory. Next to them is Garrett Morgan, customs officer in San Pedro. Means Duvall's moving his drugs through the port. And the rest of those thugs are his security. Oh, sorry. I did it again. Just look away. Stop looking at him. But what is this? - Why do they do that? - I don't know. - Who is that sexy to? - Nobody. - No one. - Ever. "Oh, let me...

Hi! - Hi. - Hi. - And you are? - I'm her friend. Hello, Nina's friend. What's your name? Oh, my name is... is Jodee. - Homegirl Jodee. - Yep. Homegirl Jodee? - Homegirl Jodee.

WARREN: George Gerald Frazier... Low-level drug dealer out of Palm Beach, but he's been off the DEA's radar for a while. He must have set up shop in LA. I like your, uh... gold chains. MAN: We're moving to the lower level. We left eyes on the perimeter. CALLOWAY: Keep your head on a swivel. Watch your backs. Duvall travels with a lot of firepower. FRAZIER: Bishop Duvall throws great parties. I'm a guest of the man himself. - Have you met Bishop? - I have not. - You should meet Bishop. - BAINES: This is our shot, ladies. - Let's meet Bishop. - Let's do that. - Okay. - Alright. - Excuse us, sweetie. - Wait, what? It's kind of like... a really strict VIP area. But we're, like... we're together. I mean, it's like... I know. I'm... I'm... I'm... Just wait right there.

I'm not interested. Well, if your selection of business partners is anything like your security, you might want to consider it. I know you set up shop in LA, and I can launder your money for you.

And just for the record, it was the DEA who confirmed Petrov's lead. Yeah, but my men weren't the ones on the ground. There were two injuries. One of them was a civilian. My team followed protocol. You want to start blaming somebody? Hey, hey, hey. This is on all of us, okay? Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, they're back, they're back. - What happened? You two okay? - Yeah, we're good. Alright, so, what's the next move? I mean, Duvall found out we were coming and moved his drugs. - Wasn't him. - What? Duvall had no idea his drugs were missing. Gabriel Knox is making a power play. Yeah, and we can confirm that sooner than later. I offered our services as money launderers to Duvall. - "Our services"? - Me and McKenna, undercover. If Knox is using Duvall as a supplier, and we clean the money, we'll have access to the finances. Exactly. So, I need you to resurrect Nina Beckham. Nina Beckham died six years ago in Miami, Syd.

Hey, we have some thoughts on our diamond heist. - A'ight. - You talk to these two about our case? What you talking about, "these two"? - One, two. - [Stammering] Hey, hey, hey. We're all working on the diamond heist. No, no, no, no. They're working near it. We're working on it. - Do you want our help or not? - Yes. [Scoffs] Sure, Jodee and Nina. Why don't you guys come on in in the 11th hour after all the hard work has been done? NANCY: Get over it, baines. Walker, you said Dakari described Romeo - as being desperate, right? - Mm-hmm. When did this little info pow-wow take place? [Sighs] He tried to sell him his... his car, his business, and his cellphone. Okay, the... the man was in debt, okay? But you cannot sell a business that you don't own outright. - Okay. - And you also said that Dakari mentioned Romeo was smelling like old-man aftershave, - but he hadn't shaved. - The man was funky. He was trying to cover it up with a little Aqua Velva. - We all do it. - Maybe, maybe. But hold that thought. So, we searched for commercial businesses in LA with owners named Tony Smith. [Laughs] Can't be a lot of those. - 82, give or take. - What? See, now I'm mad at you. You're gonna... But only one Anthony Smith who owns a barber shop called Romeo's. Which just happens to be for sale by owner. - Yep. - The barber shop and the aftershave smell. - Yeah. - Well, let's go. You can cry about it in the car. Wow. [Chuckles] ♪ LAPD! NANCY: Tony Smith? Tony Smith. We're police officers, and we need to ask you a few questions. ♪ Damn. ♪ Oh, Romeo. WALKER: And we're back where we started. NANCY: Now it's a heist and two murders. ♪ SYD: Duvall has five properties in LA and another three in orange county. Any one of them could be the drop location for money or the transfer of drugs from the port in San Pedro. If we do this right, we can finally get Knox. Syd, do you ever think about anything else? Yeah, sometimes. Tuesdays and Thursdays from 2:00 to 7:00. Mm-hmm. [Chuckles] - Do you ever think about us? - Oh, my God. - Warren, why? - What? You went from a perfectly good 7:00 dinner conversation to a 9:00, "after two glasses of wine" conversation. Okay, well, I'm trying to get to a 10:00 conversation. - Oh, really? - Yes, and I have my fingers crossed for an 11:00, although hopefully by that time, we won't be talking too much. [Cellphone ringing] Mm. Hello? Okay, great. I'll be waiting for your call, Frazier. - [Cellphone beeps] - Yes! Duvall is arranging a meeting and... Okay, again with the face. [Chuckling] What? Look, I just want you to just be careful, Syd. You've got to be more cautious this time. That's not how I work, and you know that, Warren. Okay? When I go undercover, - I'm all in. - Okay, but at what cost? This drive to get Knox, is it necessary, Syd? Babe, you were beaten, you were tortured, and you survived. - Isn't that a victory? - No. - Why not? - [Chuckles, sighs] [Scoffs] I... look. I'm not saying that you can just forget what happened. I understand. But why do you refuse to just move on? Because he took something from me that I can't get back. What did he take? What did he take? 'Cause you know what I see? This is what I see. I see a beautiful, strong, intelligent, amazing woman who moved to Los Angeles to start over again. But guess what? You can't. You won't allow yourself to. And it's only because you're just... Stuck in revenge mode. Yeah, you're damn right I am. I was pregnant, Warren. Okay? I was pregnant. ♪ He took our baby. God, I'm so sorry, Syd. Syd, I'm so sorry. He took our baby. Syd, come here. I'm so sorry. [Horn blaring in distance] Just saw the results of the ultrasound. Michelle and I are having twins. What? Just two? Yeah, boys. Uh, they didn't see him the first time. Hidden twin or something like that. [Laughs] Now, that's how you do it! Congratulations, man! - I'm so happy for you. - Thank you. But you're never gonna sleep again. - What? - It's over. I wasn't going to tell Warren at all. It just... came out. Are you relieved, though? Yeah, kind of. What about Patrick? Mm. He loves you, McKenna. You know, I was thinking about my undercover name. Okay, um... Yeah, about that. Jodee? So, suddenly, you're a truck driver? No. Don't you remember? Oh, God. - The bitch from third grade. - From third grade. - Right. Wow. - Yeah. I don't know. It just sounded tough in the moment. But I thought of a last name... Jodee Navarro. Mm! Navarro does... it does make it a lot better. Yeah, it's like a sexy Catholic school drop-out maybe. A lot better than Nina Beckham. I mean, what white family adopted your ass? Nina Beckham is amazing. I mean, she'll drive you to the airport. She's trustworthy. I think she shops at Macy's. I... she's got good credit. - Hey, kiddo. - KATELYN: Hi, Warren. - What are you doing here? - [Imitates explosion] I need to talk to your mom. CARLENE: Alright. Bye, Mommy! Bye, Warren! She's gotten so big. What do you want, Warren? I'm done, Carlene. We had an agreement. Your job was to make sure the DEA is an asset, not an adversary. I held up my end. Colby went rogue, I took care of it. You were able to move Duvall's drugs with no problems. Tough being caught in the middle, huh? [Sighs] She's always been your weakness. Your kryptonite. This is about Syd Burnett. No. Just shut it down, Carlene. ♪ PATRICK: Alright, I'm here. Why'd you call me? CARLENE: I need a favor, Patrick. Okay. I'm investigating a rumor of corruption in the police department. Could be a conflict of interest for me. [Laughs] Come on. You're the D.A. Could be a very impressive accomplishment to brag about on your campaign. And I did uncover conclusive evidence that suggested foul play in your mother-in-law's disappearance. That kind of memory loss comes with a price. You look nervous. I get the feeling I'm being handled. ♪ I've sent you the file. Let me know. ♪ Hey, Dante. Come on, man. Answer my messages. Where are you? Call me, bro. [Knock on door] ♪ Nico? Yeah. I'm your brother-in-law, Patrick. Can I come in? ♪ Yeah, come on. It's good to finally meet you. ♪
