Look, come here. Come here. It goes all the way up here. hey! come back, you are going? Hey sweet baby Fasted confession ever All Mickey did was givin us a location of a stash house he was planning to rub anyway - Nice work, partner - That's what we do - Okay. So now we have a stash house location - Banging Bodys out of shop. We gonna get the stuff out of your apartment... Putting it in the shop and, and then... then we'll call in a raid You mean Fentanyl out of my loft? - I don't pay what i pay in rent for an apartment - that's what you seriously thinking about, right now? No, I'm actually thinking about how the hell do i get the drugs out of my loft, ending into a stash house without anyone knowing - whatever it is, It's gonna be after hours. - Okay, fine. It will be Tomorrow night. Okay, fine. It'll be tomorrow night. We'll wait for everyone to clear out, and then we'll plant the drugs. Can you please stop using that word? - Drugs? - I mean, we're committing a-a felony. We are legitimizing a drug find with the LAPD and keeping millions of dollars worth of fentanyl off the streets. I understand that what we're doing is the right thing to do. You know, it's for... for the greater good. But when you're saying "plant the drugs" and "fentanyl," it just sounds, like, really dirty. Okay, fine. Fine, fine. How about, uh, we'll deliver the package tomorrow night. ♪♪ You're such an asshole. Okay, so it's a stash house. So they probably have security, right? - Yeah. - Do you think they have cameras? Good call. We're gonna need masks. Okay, I can jump the alarm system. - Of course you can. - I'm just gonna need... a voltage meter, wire stripper, alligator clips, and a 9-volt battery. Who are you? Do you think they have guard dogs? - And we will pick up some steaks. - Seriously? Like a Bugs Bunny cartoon? - Steaks? - Do you have a better idea? Steaks it is. Okay. So... so, do we... do we cook the steaks? Instead of, like, making them with, like, a nice béarnaise? Well, I don't know! [Car alarm blaring in distance] [Sighs] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Don't act like you're not just trying to get up underneath this water. Mm, it's cold as hell right there in the back of the shower. ♪♪ How about now? I love now. ♪♪ What's up? ♪♪ I have to get to work. Nah, I mean, are you sure? - Yeah. - Baby. [Scoffs] ♪♪ [Sighs] [Indistinct announcement over P.A.] ♪♪ It's been a while. I've been busy. Glad you're here. Come on. ♪♪ NANCY: [Yawns] Good morning. Long night? Yeah. [Groans] I made a smoothie. There's some left if you want it. - Thanks. - Mm. [Sighs] The Internet is slow again. [Scoffs] I'll reset the router. Damn thing. Uh, it's all good. I'll just, um, I'll do it when I get home. Oh. Okay. Net neutrality, right? The Internet thing? At least we have Internet. Um, I've actually got Model UN tonight, so I'm gonna be late. Really? What country? Oh, um, Philippines. - Huh. - What? I don't know, you just usually talk at length about the countries you're... Mm, yeah, I've just had a lot on my mind and forgot. 7:30. I should go, but... Okay, have a good day. You, too. Love you! I'm telling you, she's just acting really weird. SYDNEY: Like, "obsessed with death" weird, or, like, "shave her head to troll her parents" weird? Like, "up to something" weird. Apparently, she's got Model UN. Isn't that the thing where, like, nerds pretend to be other countries and, like, yell at each other? Yeah, colleges love it. And you're suspicious why? Because usually, she schools Patrick and me on whatever country she's debating on weeks in advance. Could be a cover for robbing a check-cashing store. What was that, Syd? I don't think the arson unit heard you. [Sighs] So you think she's ditching school? Mm. Yep, she's ditching. - Wait, are you... - Damn straight I'm tracking her. It's how I keep her safe. Well, it is a perfect day to ditch. The weather's gorgeous. Where do you think she's going? I don't know. Looks like she went back home. Hmm, well, however you decide to mother this up, after everything Izzy's been through, she could use a day off. Yeah, well, I'll be watching. Naturally. Are you sure your dad's not gonna come home? I'm not trying to get busted for truancy by the district attorney. That's got to go on your permanent record. Okay, first of all, no such thing as a permanent record. Your juvie file gets sealed when you turn 18. And, second, he's out of town at some deposition so he won't be back till tomorrow. Thank you for... pretending to pick you up so Nancy doesn't know you're skipping? Izzy, are you okay? I mean, you shaved your head, and now you're skipping. You don't skip school. What's up? I just... I have something that I have to do. Hey, if... if this was some sort of "13 reasons why" situation, you would tell me, right? It... it is not that. [Chuckles] I'm fine, okay? Don't... don't worry. [Cellphone chimes] And my ride is here. [Sighs] People love you. Okay, Letti, if I was gonna hurt myself, why would I call a car? I would just do it in my home. Whatever secret thing you're doing that you can't even tell your best friend about... Be careful. I will. Also, wasn't shaving your head part of this? Kind of a hat on a hat, isn't it? Yeah, I got cold. [Chuckles] SYDNEY: What could she possibly get into? I've done some crazy shit in my day. You? Once broke the windows of my ex's Jeep in college. Stabbed Jodee Thompson with some scissors. Who's Jodee Thompson? Some bitch... In third grade. [Elevator bell dings] [Sighs] ♪♪ SYDNEY: Afternoon, people. All right. Knox has moved from oxy to fentanyl. My source in middle management believes he already has Chinese distribution. They will be moving the drugs from the east over the Glades. I've set up a meet with a Lieutenant Kobi about washing the new money. At this rate, I will be face-to-face with Knox by the end of the year. WARREN: But where's the meet? Miami Plaza. Mm. No. No go. It's too crowded, and no way to lock it down. Changing the location will make them suspicious. Yeah, but if you give them a good enough reason, they'll buy it. They will know something is up. Agent Burnett, if this thing goes sideways, a lot of innocent people could get hurt. I am aware of the drawbacks. I still prefer to explore how we can minimize the risk at the Plaza. And I'm the special agent in charge and responsible for the safety of all my agents. And my safety relies on remaining uncompromised. Changing the meet will compromise me. Fine. But just pick a spot near the least populated entrance. Thank you. You're welcome. And no cowgirl shit. Let's stick to the script. All right. Thanks, all. And here I thought cowgirl was your favorite. - Syd, I'm worried about you. - You are undermining me. It's still my call. You're gonna make me pull rank? You would never pull rank on a man. You wouldn't. Because I'm trying to protect you. And that is what I'm talking about. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Woman grunting] - WALKER: Come on, dude. - BAINES: It's educational. Yeah, it's a lesson in what your wife's vagina looks like. Hey, don't look at that. - Just look at the baby. - [Baby crying] I don't want to look at any of it. Yeah, but you need to know this stuff, first-time dad. What? Congrats! That's great! [Cheers and applause] We weren't gonna announce it, but thanks. - Yeah, well, then why'd you tell me? - Just forget it. And I'm not even gonna make fun of you for this. This is really great news. Yeah, I mean, as long as the baby looks like Michelle, you're all good. - Thank you, McKenna. - [Laughs] All right, Han and Chewblacka, are we ready to do this? - Yo, Syd. Wait. - Oh, yeah, hold on with that. SYDNEY: All right, big Mikey's intel tells us that the buy is going down today at Banging Body Auto Shop in east LA. CCD tells us that it is a chop shop. Thanks for the background, Detective Burnett. This chop shop specializes in moving large quantities of dope through the city. - We tried to tell her. - Well, I mean, you should've tried harder. Robbery homicide facilitated a deal for Michael Lachapelle, street name "Big Mikey," and that's where the narcotics division comes in. Can I speak to you for a minute? Please, Lieutenant. Check your briefing books. We'll go over the plan in a moment. Where are you going? BAINES: Ooh, you're up to something. If your son justice ditched school, I'm sure... Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See, see, see... Justice and I, we operate on perfect trust. - Justice know I'll beat that ass. - [Cellphone chimes] Trust that. Um, I... I'll be right back. What the hell are you doing? Prepping my raid. Big Mikey sticks up and kills dope boys. That is literally robbery and homicide. I'm gangs and narcotics. We're raiding drugs. From a gang. This is our lead, Calloway. You know how it works. We have every right to see this case through. And you can. In a support role. I got lead now. You know, I could really use your DA background on this one. Don't patronize me. I read your old file. ♪♪ You were a rock star in Miami. Well, if you read my file, then you know how it ended. Yeah. [Sighs] I'm sorry about that. ♪♪ That's why I hope I'm wrong about club Cyrk. Raid's been moved up to 3:00 pm if you're still in. We could use you. ♪♪ NANCY: Hey. What's wrong? I heard Ray's dead. Is it true? Come on. Yeah, Ray's dead. No one's seen Dante in a few days. I'm sure he's fine. Is this why you asked me not to answer questions about you? Huh? Is there something up? Something you need to tell me, Nance? No, Nico. I... Ray pissed people off. I heard they burned him alive. He was a bad guy. I know you never liked him, but Ray did all right by me when you were gone. - I know. - He looked out for me. And I'm sorry I didn't tell you. - You're sorry... - It's just... You can try to forget about the past all you want. But I will never forget what Ray and Dante did for us. You shouldn't either. ♪♪ [Door opens] ♪♪ Hey. Yo. What's up? What's up with Syd and McKenna? They're acting weird, right? Hey, look, man, my name is Matt, and I ain't in that. I'm sure they'll put us in the loop when the time is right. Yeah, but aren't you, like, a little curious? Of course I'm curious. I'm a detective, I'm always curious. - Right, so... - But I do respect the code. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We have each other's backs unconditionally. - But... - Nope! - It's just... - [Stammers] As soon as you say "but," that's conditional. We have each other's back what? Unconditionally. Right. Come here, let me show you something. You got to see this. [Sighs] Dude! What... what is that? That's what happens if you get shot in the belly. Huh? Did you know you have to use a catheter, a tube in your pee-hole? [Sighs] Why are you even looking at that? I like to be prepared. There's something wrong with you. I like to know all the eventualities of being out in the field, and now I know I don't want to get shot in the belly. You had to look at dick pics to figure that out? What? Knowledge is power, brother! CALLOWAY: Detective Walker. Ah, Lieutenant, um... Actually, I wanted to thank you for giving me the opportunity to be on the raid. No thanks needed. Your résumé speaks for itself. Being pulled out of the academy for undercover work - is no small thing. - [Chuckles] I guess I just got, you know, one of those faces. I'm curious... why didn't you put in for narcotics? Put those uc skills to use more often. Uh, because I like being married. [Chuckles] Fair point. So, listen, I've been wondering about Burnett. She seem distracted to you? Distracted? Like her mind's not on the job. Yeah, no, I know what distracted means. I'm just curious if you're actually concerned or you're just digging for dirt on my friend. [Chuckles] That obvious. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Enjoy your tea. - Mm-hmm. Uh, actually, Lieutenant... a little bit of advice? If you ever want to go undercover, you got Narc written all over you. ♪♪ SYDNEY: We can't wait until tonight. We need to get rid of those drugs now. Calloway is throwing a wrench in our plan. You know what, things change. We change the plan. Do we need a wrench, by the way? No. You know what, maybe. - Add it to the list. - Okay. You know what, this is gonna work. Yeah, it's just gonna be a little harder now that it's not our show. I like this version better. It's cleaner. It's more costume changes. Seriously, if you want to rethink this, it's cool. Syd, we're good. I mean, I'm just saying, if we go to jail, we're gonna be in different gangs. It's a race thing, I'm gonna have to shank you. Well, you're gonna have to get past Roxy. - Roxy? - I go to jail with this face, the first thing I do is wife up. ♪♪ Izzy is way out of city limits. Maybe she went to Big Bear with her friends. That sounds like a thing white kids do. All right, large? You want to fight inside or outside? They're coveralls. They're supposed to cover all. What do you think she's doing? I don't know. All right, orange or gray? - Seriously? - Orange. [Stammers] Obviously gray. All right, let's see what else we need. - Gas masks. - I don't know. It just doesn't feel like a normal ditch day. Well, the girl's mom died. She's working it out. Well, that's exactly why I'm not on her ass. But she's running out of rope. Here. Oh, Jesus. Okay. What are you doing? Firing a warning shot. Asking her if she wants me to pick her up after Model UN. Ooh, that's good. That's good. [Cellphone chimes] "No. I'm going over to Letti's after." No emojis. - That little liar! - Mm. "Okay. Be safe." Wait, that's it? Yeah, I mean, she's too smart to do something truly dangerous. I'll let her have it when I get home tonight. If we didn't have this other thing today... Oh, we'd be stalkin' her ass. [Laughing] Ooh! That girl has no idea. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ [Clears throat] Just, uh, put a new transmission in last year. All it needs is an oil change. Oil change, huh? And a little TLC. 'Cause it's not gonna do me any good sitting in my driveway. Oh, it'll run. - How much? - $1,500. This thing is barely street legal. I'll give you $750. The ad says "as-is." $1,200. That your house with the window box? Yeah. Why?
