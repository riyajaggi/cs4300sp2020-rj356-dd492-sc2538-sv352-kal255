 That is long over. It's in the past. Funny thing about the past, never seems to stay behind you. Dante? I was just checking out the old neighborhood. He was outside when I came back from my run. There's drugs missing. I need you to help me find Ray, I have nowhere else to go. [Grunting] - Hey, Arlo. - Find your brother. And get my drugs back! Are you sure this is the same Dante Sherman? Ray Sherman's brother? I'm positive. All that talk about, "I got your back...

Is today the day? Do I finally get your confession? I'd have to be a sinner first. Guess I dressed up for nothing. You know... You don't have to suffer alone. Maybe I don't want to drag other people into my suffering. Even Job, the man who suffered most at the hand of God, had friends to comfort him. Job 2:11-13. "Job's three friends, Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar, they left their homes to comfort him. And when they saw him, they sat on the ground with him, seven days, seven nights. No one said a word because they saw how great his suffering." Impressive. Though you've missed the forest for the trees. The point isn't that the friends were silent. It's that after all he went through, Job still had friends. ♪♪ PATRICK: Izzy, have you thought about what you're gonna wear tonight? ISABEL: No, but you obviously have. This shouldn't be that difficult. It's a press event. Okay? Everyone has to dress up. - Even Nancy. - NANCY: Even Nancy? What the hell's that supposed to mean? - [Bag zips] - I'm just saying that we have to dress to impress. I'm not gonna pretend to be something that I'm not. Mm. You are a beautiful, brilliant young woman. But for the presser tonight, can you be those things in an appropriate outfit? - [Scoffs] - Let's just indulge your father in his old-school misogyny for tonight. Come on. It's his issue, not ours. Sure. Thank you. ♪♪ You know that I love the way that you dress. Damn straight you do. [Chuckles] See you tonight. DANTE: I'm gonna see you in a couple weeks, all right?

[Squeals] didn't happen? I don't know, are we gonna pretend like you didn't do a background check on me, which is, - like, a major violation? - Oh, my God. Okay, here we go. Look, after what you've done, you don't get to dig into my life. Nobody cares what you did, McKenna! Everybody's got a past. And for the record, I wasn't digging into your life. I was looking into Ray Sherman, which led me to his brother, Dante, which led me to you. And you shouldn't be surprised, 'cause I saw Dante at your house. Because of you! You are dragging me into your mess. [Sighs] I know what Gabriel Knox did to you, but... I don't even know what Gabriel Knox did to me. I've got the scars, I've got the medical records, but when I close my eyes at night, I can't even see the asshole's face. Asshole's face? Yeah, that sounded differently in my head. Yeah, it's like a little... It's like a... like a little... ...tiny asshole in the middle. Little asshole face. Disgusting. Yeah. You can't keep ducking me on this. My past needs to stay where it is. You need to respect that. [Sirens wail in distance] I'm gonna go downstairs and finish up. ♪♪ BAINES: Yo, so these guys Rob a bank, then dump their getaway car all the way out here in the boonies?

I don't know what I'm gonna do without you there to give me... Guidance? The wisdom of my years? Shit. Ah! [Laughs] I work harder to keep you from giving me shit. [Laughs] That's right. Mm. Ooh. Whew. Speaking of which, some of us still have work to do. I just came by... to give you this. Thanks, boss, for everything. Hey, listen. When you're an A.D.A., you're, uh... you're a prosecutor. It's... it's easy to tell who the bad guys are. But after tonight, you're gonna be a politician. It won't be so easy to tell the good from the bad. You're a boy scout. You hold on to that. Won't be as easy as you think. ♪♪ ♪♪ Victim is Lowell Hudson. Owns a helicopter sightseeing tour company. Hmm. So maybe Lowell was taking out a tour and fell out? Right. He owns one of those magical helicopters that, you know, keep flying even when the pilot accidentally falls out. Hmm. Or maybe Lowell was pushed out of his chopper... for being a smart ass. Did he have a partner? He did, in fact. Todd Kendrick. We just got a new helo. A big Robinson R44. Lowell figured if we could take a few more people up at a time, we could make a few extra bucks. We were in debt up to our eyeballs. Lowell loved the company. [Sighs] He really, um... He really... He really, really what? Focus! [Snaps fingers] He really blamed himself that we weren't doing great. We're partners, but he was the business guy. I just flew the helos. We were up in the R44 doing an initial FAA A-D eval. - Just the two of you? - Yeah. We're up, and Lowell is... distracted. Outta nowhere, he throws the door open. Only takes a second for the downwash to catch him. It was all I could do to keep the helo on axis against the wash. - Lowell was gone. - SYD: Mm. [Sighs] - Not bad. - Yeah, like a B-minus. - Yeah. - Excuse me? You didn't stick the landing. - Neither did Lowell. - Oh, too soon. - Too soon? - Yeah, a little soon. I-I didn't have to come here. Sure you did. How else were you gonna tell us this story that you spent the last few hours rehearsing? [Scoffs] What? Tense shift... it's a dead giveaway. The first part of your story, I mean, that was in past tense, so it was probably true. You were in debt. Lowell blamed himself. See, when people rehearse, they tend to replay events like they're happening now. Lowell is distracted. He throws open the door. Was your radio down? I'm just wondering why there wasn't a mayday call. 'Cause Lowell was your friend, right? Wouldn't you call for help? I want a lawyer. Now he calls for help. Uh, you're free to go. We can't hold you here for being a bad liar. But be somewhere we can find you. [Indistinct conversations] That's our killer. You're just suspicious of everyone, aren't ya? How is he not guilty? No, I mean, obviously he knows something, but have you ever been in a helo when the door's open? Downwash is a bitch. He'd need both hands to stay on axis. So, somebody else must have been in the chopper when Lowell was pushed. - Yeah. - Hey, hey, hey! Get ready to drop to number two on the leader board. Teletypes confirmed our burnt car linked the merchant's bank robbery to three other heists this month. Same M.O., a professional crew. So we're gonna be needing the big board for this one. 'Cause y'all not using it, right? - [Chuckles] - You're not... using... So that's four crimes you guys won't be solving instead of just one? - Ah! - Ah! Oh, oh, that actually reminds me, we found something we thought might help with your jumper. [Smacks lips] [Laughs] You're just carrying that around in your pocket? - Yeah. - He... he... he's getting good. Look at her face. Look at her face. - You know, Lou, he's trying. - [Cellphone vibrates] [Sighs] I got to bounce. - What? Right now? - Yeah. Izzy. Okay. All right, I'll see you later tonight. Wait. You're gonna come still? Yeah. I just didn't think you'd want to after this morning. I'll be there. Cool. [Elevator dings] - Yo, McKenna, can I get a minute? - [Sighs] You've got, like, five floors. I'll be blunt. Syd's gonna get herself arrested if she's lucky. Killed if she's not. You want to help her? Help me. That's really dramatic. Syd says you were off the clock at club Cyrk the night before it burnt down. Just two girls out for drinks. But I've got witness statements saying you pulled your service weapon on the owner, Ray Sherman. Your witnesses don't happen to work for Ray, do they? You're the smart one. I'm guessing you were there to stop Syd from doing something impulsive. Be smart now. If she's into something, it could blow back on you. - [Elevator dings] - Time's up. [Quietly] Dick. Don't say I didn't warn you! [Metal rattling] DANTE: Arlo? ♪♪ I don't have your drugs, but, you know, maybe we can work something out... make a deal. ♪♪ Ray? ♪♪ [Cellphone rings] ♪♪ [Cellphone beeps] RAY: How many times do you want me to say it? - I don't have your fentanyl. - ARLO: He isn't taking us seriously. I guess we need to show them Sherman brothers just how serious Gabriel Knox is. - Dante... - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! ...if you don't deliver Mr. Knox's fentanyl, - you're next. - No, no, no, no! I'll find your... I'll find your... - Or should we visit your son first? - [Gasps] I'll find your drugs! Just give me some time. I might know where they are. Sorry, Ray. Time's up. No! I'll find the drugs! ♪♪ - [Retches] - Izzy! We're late! ISABEL: Waiting on you. ♪♪ ♪♪ Well? It's cute. That's it? Yeah. I'm gonna throw on a lip, maybe pull my hair back. Okay. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ HOWSER: So I can say with absolute confidence that Patrick McKenna will be a credit to this city as interim D.A. [Applause] PATRICK: I've learned everything I know... Ooh. Syd, I love the dress. Thanks, Izzy. Nice dome. - Thank you. - PATRICK: As interim D.A., I will continue his legacy of integrity and service to the city of Los Angeles. Thank you. [Applause] All right, let's do this. Can't I stay with Syd? Mnh-mnh. If I gotta go, you gotta go. - Okay. - Smile with your teeth. - Let's do this. - Okay. - Congratulations. - Thanks. [Camera shutters clicking] [Softly] Don't freak out. What's there to freak out about? I am dressed to impress. Actually, I think it looks really cool. - You do? - Yeah. Very Emma Gonzalez. - Mm. Hmm. - Yeah. REPORTER: Mr. McKenna, a photo, please? [Camera shutters clicking] [Softly] Hey. I'm proud of you. [Softly] I'm worried about her. Yeah, me too. ♪♪ ♪ It's gettin' hard to leave now ♪ ♪ You drive me wild every time you come around ♪ ♪ It's gettin' hard to leave now ♪ - You dodged a bullet. - Excuse me? A man dense enough to ignore that dress isn't worth your time. You window shopping? I was. But I think I found what I'm looking for. And what's that? Call it a spiritual connection. So we're soulmates now? Maybe... In a previous life. Little cheesy. - [Chuckles] - A little cheesy. My ex-husband believed in mystics. So when our marriage was on the rocks, he dragged me to a reading. The psychic told us our souls were linked in the past. Ancient Egypt. I was a slave. He was my master. Figures. She said we found each other in this life to reverse the sins of the past. My husband filed for divorce the next day. You're better off without him. I know. Time to go press the flesh. Pleasure was mine. Not entirely. [Camera shutters clicking] ♪♪ Um... Be right back. ♪♪ Can I get some more? ♪♪ Want a drink? What the hell are you doing here? Tequila with one ice cube is still your drink, right, Perez? - Right? - It's McKenna. Oh, I know who you are. What is wrong with you? What's wrong with me? Ray's... dead. Knox killed him. And I found him behind this club, this club that were gonna open to get out from underneath Knox. They're coming for me next. So... [Sniffs] You know what's interesting about it? They burned him alive... they burned him alive because they think that... that he stole some drugs and burnt down the club. But you and I, we both know what really happened, don't we? Oh, God. Dante, I-I'm so sorry. I know that that's bullshit, because you hated Ray. And the feeling was mutual, okay? But that guy always came good for us. You know that. You owe him. So, what do you want from me? I want you to do your job. And I want you to find who did this. - Good to see you, Patrick. - Thanks for coming. You need to leave right now. [Sniffs] You owe me. Go. Please. ♪♪ [Keys jingle] [Keys clatter] ♪♪ ♪♪ [Grunting] [Breathing heavily] [Grunting] ♪♪ Totes sorry about all this. We were hoping to find my stash before you got home. Ray told us that you had it, so we, uh, figured you were a night owl. This is early for you, yeah? [Groans] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I got to get this. - [Camera shutter clicks] - [Grunts] Ooh!

Careful what you wish for. Get the hell out of my house. ♪♪ [Door opens] [Door closes] ♪♪ Hey. What's up, kiddo? I think we work best with healthy boundaries based on my respectful deference to you as an authority figure. [Laughs] - Respectful? - Mostly. Oh, really? Um... You know, I, uh... I rebelled when I was around your age. And I did something really bad... my mom would've killed me if she found out about it. So I hid it from her for a year. It's the biggest one I got, as well... [Chuckling] I was in love. Needless to say, I wasn't as brave as you. You just, like, went for it, and you're not hiding from anyone. Thanks. Being a teenager's really hard, and... and it can get pretty dark. I just want you to know that if, uh... If you ever want to, like, talk about anything... I'm here for you. Yeah. Um... I just, uh... I'm... I miss her. I'm sorry. Why? You know? You didn't... Drive drunk and plow into our car. I know, honey. But I can be sorry you lost your mom. I guess. Thanks. Do you have to do that? It's the cleanest thing in here, bro. [Exhales sharply] [Metal creaks] [Door closes] I can get Mr. Knox's fentanyl back. - I know who took it. - You don't know anything. I sent you the details. But you don't know who Syd is. She's some cop. She's nobody. A nobody who put your man in stitches. Atticus had a bad night. I'll take care of it. Mr. Knox has lost faith in you. That's why I'm here. Well, it's unnecessary. You all set? He's good to go? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - [Gunshot] ♪♪ CARLENE: You tried it your way. You underestimated her, and you failed. So, Mr. Knox would prefer I take over the day-to-day. From here on out, you'll do exactly as I instruct. Have I made myself clear? I need an answer, Arlo. Communication is everything. Yes, you've made yourself clear. Excellent. Because that's the only warning you get. ♪♪ What's up? [Chuckles] Salt-N-Pepa hit a road block in their case. ♪♪ "Thanks for the freedom. Keep up the bad police work." - Oh, "love, the bank robbers." - [Chuckles] See, you done messed up now, Nancy. All right? Now I gotta come at you. You left me no choice. Gave me a chuckle. Long night? Something like that, yeah. So, uh, did you figure out who pushed Lowell out of the helicopter? No, but check this out. Passenger manifests. These three people don't have any payment records. Paula Downey, Seth Lynwood, and Chris Torrance. So, the company's going out of business, but they're giving away free flights? That's what I thought. So obviously I dug deeper, and those three people don't exist. Kendrick filed flight times with the tower and had to list names for the company records, but those flights were empty. So Paula Downey, Seth Lynwood, and Chris Torrance. Hey! Just 'cause we hit a dead end doesn't mean you got to dunk on us, all right? - What? - I can hear you. Downey, Lynwood, Torrance? What... what are you taking about? Where the robberies were... in Downey, Lynwood, and... Wait, what are you talking about? Where was that last burned car? Uh, Hansen Hills. Hmm. Check this out. Rachel Hansen! - [Exhales sharply] - Wait, what? So, walk us through the crimes. Okay, we got four heists with escape routes we don't know. [Alarm blaring in distance] They come in hard and fast. They take the drawers, whatever's on the customers, but they never hit the vault. [Alarm continues] [Sirens wailing in distance] [Engine revs, tires screech] BAINES: And they peel out less than 90 seconds before the units get to the scene. [Alarm continues] Okay, you guys were wondering how their escape routes always avoided the black-and-whites? Well, they got eyes in the sky. And that solves their second problem. Car swap. Yeah, torch the car to get rid of any trace. That's right. And meanwhile, your boy Kendrick flies them away. No tracks to follow. Just said that. - This one. - I know. All right, so what do you think? We'll shout you out in the report. [Laughs] - What? - This is our case. - Right? - Whoa! You woulda spend the day googling Downey McTorrance if I hadn't brought you in on this. Just got a call. Glendale First National Bank. All right, well, if our theory is correct, then we know exactly where Kendrick and his heist crew - will be landing, so... - Mm-hmm. - [Mumbles indistinctly] - Right. - What? - We'll split the credit. - [Stammers] What? - We'll split the credit!

[Laughs] This is great, man. ♪♪ So, what were they looking for? $20 million worth of fentanyl. - Give or take. - Are you kidding me? They could've killed you! Knox is a businessman. A dead cop isn't good for business. So... so all this shit, all this damage you have caused is because of that?! That is 50 times more potent than heroin. Two milligrams is a lethal dose. There's over 100 pounds here... enough to kill 26 million people. So, no, no. I-I d... I didn't plan any of this. Yes, I-I burned down the club. But before I did, I found that hidden in a back room. So I couldn't just leave it there. Ray's dead because of that. Because you stole that fentanyl. And, yeah, he made bad choices, but you know what? So did I. And I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Ray and Dante! If you think I'm gonna weigh Ray's life against all of the people who could've died because Knox wanted to put that poison on the streets... do the math, McKenna! ♪♪ ♪♪ You... You were right. You are right. There is no way that I can get to Knox without affecting the people that I care about. Be real. If I would have told you that I knew Ray... ♪♪ Yeah. I would have done things differently. I'm sorry. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Sighs] I need to get rid of this stuff. I really got to get rid of this stuff before somebody else gets hurt.

[Exhales sharply] Did they lose their shit? It's not about that. I heard James and them talking about it. They think it's hot. It's definitely not about that. Might as well enjoy the fringe benefits. - [Scoffs] - And for future reference, there are much easier ways to get a fake. That's the point. Fake won't work. Gotta be real. You may want to spend some more time by the pool. - [Chuckles] - It's close enough, okay? Thank your cousin for me. [Sighs] [Door opens] [Keys clatter] Who the hell are you? Calm down. I heard you were looking... for me. Hi. Can you drop the gun? You're the one who called me. Patel? You should get better locks, dude. Why... why are you at my house? You first. Who told you about me? Well, the kind of person who wouldn't want me - to answer that question. - Ooh. Mysterious. How did you find out where I live? It's, like, sort of what I do. You should consider this a "proof of concept." How does this... how does... how does the whole... how does it work? Did your mystery person tell you my price? Okay. It's cool. I'll wait.

Nothing, really. Didn't seem like nothing. What do you mean? Well, he shows up claiming to have lived in this house, then he crashes my press event? That's not a coincidence. I'm the D.A. now... the face of law enforcement in the city. That puts a target on my back. I think this guy wants something from me. What do you think he wants? I'm not sure. Maybe it was a mistake taking this job. You okay? Yeah. Okay. I got work to do. 'Night. Hey. I love you. [Exhales sharply] CARLENE: Daniel, I'm sorry to see you go.
