PATRICK: Is that my credit card? We gave that to you for emergencies. A draconian dress-code policy enforced by a slut-shaming patriarchy-enabler is an emergency. Help me out here. Vice principal Roth finally got her way with the, uh, skirt-length policy. It's got to be a credit card from the knee.

Me, too. It's that parent group chat. Is this my forensic textbook? How did they get these? I swear to God, Isabel. Izzy, did you use my death book for a school presentation? I did a health report on the opioid crisis. I thought it would be a good deterrent to the other kids in class to see what happens to a body after an overdose.

Right this way. - Maxwell Reuther. - Detective Walker. This is Detective Baines. We just wanted to ask you a couple questions about Claire Smith. Did she ever mention the Garza cartel? - [Chuckling] The cartel? - Mm-hmm. - No. - And she's been in Cyprus? A couple days now. It's routine diligence. Has anybody been in her office? May I ask why? Because her computer's on. We're gonna need to see these files. I'm sorry, but I got to ask for a warrant. It would be bad for business if I share confidential client files without a compulsory warrant. Understandable. He needs a warrant. Wait. You mean like this one? [Dog barks in distance] Yes! "Mileage." Nice! You are kicking my butt. [Knock on door] Oh, don't worry. It's just the Bens. - There you go. - Hey! Yo. Where's your darker half? Yeah, we figured the two of you would be singing - into wooden spoons by now. - [Both laugh] The bens? You guys are partners with the same name? - Yep. - Yes, sir. - That's stupid. - [Laughs] That is stupid. Ain't nothing stupid about video games. Did McKenna show you the system? - No. - Come here. I got you. Hey, seriously, where's Burnett? She left. It was an emergency. You really got to get better at lying. What's up? Is everything okay? Kyle's mom is gonna land in a few hours, so I'm gonna go home and wash up. ♪♪ ♪♪ You found him? Syd, come in. Sit down. ♪♪ ♪♪ You said you have intel? Like you asked. Well, "asked" would be putting it mildly. - Demanded. - Okay, this is the deal. You wanted a relationship. I need help. This is serious. Gabriel Knox is a ghost story criminals whisper in the dark. I don't believe in ghosts. Somebody tortured me. They shot me, and they left me for dead. And I believe that it's a real, live man named Gabriel Knox. You found him. No, but I found someone who can. An old C.I. says that Ray Sherman has been running off at the mouth about being on Knox's payroll. Ray Sherman will be at his club, Cyrk, tonight. ♪♪ Your mom took you kids to Miami. I let her.

[Indistinct conversations] What happened? Cruz and a small army. Where's Kyle? [Siren wailing] [Police radio chatter, helicopter blades whirring] ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Shit just got real. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ That a shell casing you got there, Detective McKenna? An M995 armor-piercing round, to be exact. In the Navy, we used to call them "black tips." Mm. That because they got black tips on them? Keith, you're the only person around here who can get his hands on this. You and me have an understanding. Which ended the second your hardware was used on the LAPD. [Chuckles] You can't prove nothing. Last chance to do this friendly. No, no, no. I got this. See, normally, Syd is the one who would lose her cool, and I would calm her down, but... There's a kid involved, and I'm not playing good cop tonight. - You're bluffing. - She can't bluff. It's... it's a whole thing. If you don't talk by the time I'm done, - I'm gonna pull this trigger. - McKenna. LAPD tracks every round that we fire, but if one of your guns goes off...

Okay. - Right this way. - Where's my son? - Ms. Smith... - Where is Kyle? - They said you had him? - I am Captain Hirsch. - We did have him, but... - "Did"? What are you saying? Where is my son? For the past few months, I'd seen some irregularities in a few accounts... small stuff, but it added up over time. I went to Cyprus to look into it. It looked like something illegal was happening, so I froze the accounts until I could sort it out. I used a two-factor pass-code authenticator. I'm the only one... who can unfreeze the money. It's... my fault they took my son, isn't it? My detectives searched your computer and now have confirmation that your boss has been doing business with the Garza cartel. It's their money that you froze. ♪♪ What's your name? Jen. It's for my anxiety. No judgment. Let me get that. All right, here's the deal, Jen. I know that Reuther's into some bad stuff. I just can't prove it. And now he's wasting what little time I do have... To save a young boy's life. So I need to know if you saw or heard anything tonight that might be able to help us. For your anxiety. Aren't you a cop? He just hired me to party. He said he wanted to blow off some steam. That's all I know. Sorry. [Police radio chatter] REISING: Detective.

And once we pressed him on the weapons, Reuther jumped at a deal. Set up an exchange with the cartel... - money for Kyle. - Boom! Then we hit them with everything we got... - SWAT, S.I.S., HRT. - No! No good. Cruz is smart. He wants to meet at Santa Monica pier. Too many civilians to go in guns blazing. It has to be low-key. So, after the exchange, then we take down Cruz. Too dangerous. We can't send Claire in, add another hostage to the mix. No, no, no. You don't send Claire. Reuther can vouch for an undercover, right? I mean, you can hardly pass for Kyle's mom. No, I can't, but... you can. [Telephone rings in distance] ♪♪ NANCY: Grab a bite. It'll take a minute. "A feminist guide to female serial killers." Little... light reading? My dad made me read "Little Women." He trolls me, I troll back harder. So, like, passive-aggressive family book club wars? I like it. All right. [Sighs] Bye. Whoa, whoa. Slow down. - Everything okay? - Yeah. I, um... I just... I'm still on the clock, and I had to pick up clothes and... Wow. How many cases did Howser give you? - Jesus. - All of them. He is retiring. What? Really? I-I know I said I wasn't gonna run for D.A. until Izzy was in college, but... Well, I mean, you're not running. You're... interim D.A.? [Chuckles] Wow! That's huge! - Yeah. - Babe! Oh, I'm so proud of you. We ready for this? I've got a prosecutor dad and a cop for a stepmom. It's like I live in a surveillance state. They're always up in my business. Yeah, I can relate. My cop dad, he wasn't even around. He's a dick. My brother, Marcus... [Sighs] ...he had to look out for me, and I... it was like if I even thought about stepping out of line, he was all over me, you know? Like, it sucked. But... Marcus has always had my back, and your parents are always gonna have yours. ♪♪ I know Nancy makes it sound like book club is my thing, but she loves it. You shouldn't have bailed. Nancy has your back, too, you know? NANCY: Let's do this. Bye, honey. Mwah. ♪♪ Be careful... Nancy. Love you. ♪♪ ♪♪ HIRSCH: Listen up! We're up against the Garza cartel, and they're holding an 11-year-old hostage. It doesn't get any realer than this. The exchange is set for the south side of the pier.
