 Previously on "L.A.'s Finest"... 5 years ago the DEA had me investigating Gabriel Knox. And my cover got blown. I was tortured, shot, and left for dead. Knox disappeared after that. You think he's here in L.A. And Ray Sherman knows how to find him. Ray Sherman has been running off at the mouth about being on Knox's payroll. I want Gabriel Knox. As long as Knox is protecting him, Sherman's not gonna talk.

His younger brother, Dante, was the cosigner. All right, find out everything you can about Dante, and I'll call you back in an hour. Can't your boys down at the LAPD handle this? No, actually.

Hey, check this out, all right? One of the last calls Denise Bradshaw made was to this burner phone, which was purchased in a three-pack at a quick mart in Encino. - Can we I.D. the buyer? - No. Paid cash, there's no surveillance, but look at this call and text history. Yeah. So, this phone's just been used to communicate - with our victim, Denise? - Mm-hmm. It was activated a week ago and went dark right after the murder. So it has to be the killer. - Eh... - He bought three phones. So we are looking at two more potential victims. Another one of these phones was activated right after it was purchased. This guy's a possible serial killer. So, I'm gonna get whatever subscriber info I can on this phone. - Once I get a name, I'll cross-ref... - No, no, no, no. Let's not wait. I mean, he could be already on to his next victim. [Keypad beeping] [Ringing] WOMAN: Hello? You're sure it was the same hiking trail - where the woman was murdered. - Yeah. The Wilson Trail. I watched that video like a dozen times. - Where'd you meet this Eric? - In the coffee shop where I work. He came in about a month ago. We exchanged numbers. We met up at a diner after work one night. The next day, he called and asked me to go hiking. I got there first. We, uh, smoked a joint in the parking lot. Do you remember his car? Mustang. New. It didn't even have plates yet. So, tell us what happened on that trail. Just try to relax. You're doing great. [Voice breaking] Thank you. About halfway up the trail, he asked me if I brought my phone. He wanted me to film myself on storylive. I thought that was odd. I told him that I wanted to go back, and he got angry... Really angry. I had that little voice in my head telling me that I needed to get the hell out of there, so I ran. I got in my car, and I drove away. Can you describe Eric? Light brown hair, blue eyes. [Indistinct conversations] [Bell dings] Are you okay? Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just trying to think. [Indistinct conversations continue] [Chuckles] This is my brother's jacket.

He's the one who put me onto Ray Sherman... Who must have found out and killed the poor naked bastard. No, that's not Ray's style. And what do you know about Ray Sherman's style? Nothing.

Well, I tried the right way. Exhibit a... Naked black man facedown... Which leads me to, we need to get the hell out of here 'cause I don't need them connecting this to us. Bring him back alive!

Aioli on the side, easy on the onions, extra pickles. If there is Dijon mustard, I'd like that in a separate container so nothing touches." I didn't know it was an issue. If it takes more than five words to describe the order, it's not a freaking sandwich. [Beeps, rings] MAN: 911. [Indistinct conversations] Are you being helped, sir? Joseph Vaughn. I'm waiting for my daughter... Syd Burnett. Detective Baines. I didn't know Syd had a father. I... I mean, you... you have to have a father. You know, the sperm and the egg and the X, Y thing. You know, it's just that she never really talk about personal stuff, you know? Someone's here to see you, Detective Burnett! We need to talk. Now is not a good time. I'm not asking. Do you know who her dad is? Never met him. I don't think they're close. Yo, is that the Joseph Vaughn? Lots of stories out there. Don't believe everything you hear. In the academy, they used to talk about him like a lesson in what not to do. Taught to you by some corny-ass house mouse who never strapped on a gun belt. I'm sure whatever happened, he has to live with it every day. I warned you. I told you to leave it alone. No, no, no! We don't even know that Odell's death had anything to do with me looking for Knox. Listen to yourself! You're starting to believe your own bullshit. I don't have to listen to this. Yes, you do.

Walker's running down a strong lead on the Wilson Trail killer. [Sighs] You didn't tell me that "Silky" Vaughn was your dad. "Silky"? Yeah. I got to Narcotics a year after he left. Legend has it he was so smooth undercover, he could talk his way into or out of any situation. Obviously he wasn't that smooth 'cause he got fired. [Chuckles] Yeah. You know, when I was a kid, these punks caught me walking home from school alone. Chased me down, beat my ass, and took my walkman. Walkman? How old are you? Jesus. My point is, I'm sitting there on the curb, licking my wounds, wiping my tears. This young cop comes up, drives me home, even buys me a Slurpee on the way. The next day, he comes back to my house and tells me and my folks that those guys that roughed me up... ...are never gonna bother me again. Let me guess. That cop was Joseph. No. Is any part of this story true? No. [Chuckles] And nobody called your dad "Silky," either. [Laughs] You're such an ass. Well, this ass made you smile.

There's Dodger Stadium. - Hey. You all right? SYD: I'm fine. Let's worry about her. Well, obviously the killer gets off on killing his victim while they're live on social media. Are there any other cases with the same M.O.? Baines and Walker just interviewed someone who they think could have been his first target. So, Denise Bradshaw was his second. Killer bought three phones, so we have to assume he's planning on at least one more. This Eric Lacey is a serial killer in the making, if that's even his real name. He fits the description of half the white dudes in L.A. But we do know he drives a brand-new mustang with no plates. Okay. New car. We can track him down using the unique Bluetooth identifiers from the tires. Denise's co-workers said that Eric picked her up on the way to the park. Probably one or two cars that went the same route in that time frame. Find the car, we will find Denise's killer. It's worth a try. [Computer beeping] These are the towers that recorded the Bluetooth signal. So, let's see who owns these cars. We can eliminate most of these. This unknown driver's got to be the one. Damn. It's a dealership in Nevada. That doesn't help us locate Eric Lacey. Wait a minute. The Bluetooth numbers are unique to that Mustang. We can re-create the path the car took by identifying the cell towers the signal connected with. We've got multiple hits on that Bluetooth signal in that same area on two consecutive days.

I heard you and your partner were there the night before the place got torched. Apparently involved in some kind of ruckus. Ruckus? Can you describe the ruckus, sir? - Were you there or not? - Yeah.
