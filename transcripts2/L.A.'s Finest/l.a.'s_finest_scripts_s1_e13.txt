 Previously on "L.A.'s Finest"... Carlene Hart is Gabriel Knox. She knows we're after her. We need to regroup and try and figure out her next move. Top grass at the DEA created a program, we just came up with a name, Gabriel Nox. What we needed, was somebody who was connected to that criminal underworld, Carlene Hart. You were specifically told the Knox thing was dead. 48 hours, that's all I'm asking. I do this for you, that's it. You disappear.

 You guys are suspended. Effective immediately. MCKENNA: Carlene flees the country, and Warren keeps quiet. The Knox Cartel disappears. We're not gonna let that happen. So, we're dropping our rifles and running? Surrendering? You're unhappy, Mr. Doran? I'm sure Mr. Knox would be very interested in your opinion. Would you like to speak to him? Alice? The schoolteacher, right? Last time I left this bar, I fell asleep at the wheel... Crossed over into oncoming traffic, killed a woman. Do you see her every night when you close your eyes? Because I do. Put your hands up where I can see them.

 Oh! We have Carlene's money. Phony passports, forged credit cards. Dirt on everyone under Carlene's control... Without this fugitive starter kit and the van full of cash, Carlene's running out of options. I can't talk right now. Is everything okay, honey? No. Everything is not okay. You have something I want. I'm willing to make a trade. Carlene and Warren were there together when I was shot. They w... They were there together! Finish her. 16 years ago... ... I was taken prisoner. Held hostage by a drug cartel in Cuba. I was so powerless. I was just... I was just waiting to be rescued. I was a victim. I swore I would never be... anybody's victim ever again, and that... brought this on us, on Izzy. Stop. You don't need your guilt or remorse right now. So tell me what you need. Your cabinet full of guns. If it costs me my life, we're getting Izzy back. We know it's not your fault, but Izzy is in danger. Did she say where she's going? - She went to see Alice Kensler. - What? Alice started DM'ing Izzy a few days ago. She said she wanted to talk. That's impossible. Alice is locked up. - No, she got out last week. - How? Izzy wanted to tell you guys, but after what happened the first time she tried to see her... And she didn't tell you where she was meeting? - Like, nothing? - She didn't say anything. Justice offered to drive her. - Say what? - Justice took her to meet Alice. - I didn't go with them. - Wait, wait, wait. Justice took her to see the lady that killed her mom, - and you didn't tell nobody?! - Hey, hey, hey, Baines. Wait, wait. You don't know nothing?! She didn't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I gotta call Faith. - Carlene did this. - I didn't know anything. We know this isn't your fault, and hopefully, they're okay. We just have to find them, quickly. I'm sorry, I don't know anymore. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Come on. Call me if you hear anything. I'll find him. I promise. Look, the kids are gonna be okay as long as Carlene thinks she's gonna get paid. We have at least a couple hours to find them before she calls. Alright, I'll call O'Malley, put a BOLO out on Justice's car. Patrick, if Carlene used Alice to... to lure Izzy, - is there someone you can call... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm on it. Patrick McKenna. I need information on a prisoner release. Yeah. Now what? Justice's phone keeps going to voicemail. - Aah! - Sit down! My dad is going to bury you under the jail if you don't let us go! You know, does it make you feel strong to push kids around? You better hope it's my dad who gets you and not Nancy, because she'll just straight up kill you! Are you crazy? Huh? Why'd you get in his grill like that? Okay. What are you doing? I need you to cut me loose. We were taken for a reason and dragged onto this yacht. I don't know what these guys want, but they won't hurt us until they get it. - Nice. - What does that mean? I mean, we... - are invincible. - Invincible? White privilege much? These dudes could kill us. We just can't let them leave the port. What you doing? My dad's old boss took us out on his boat once, and we got halfway to Catalina and it died. How does that help us? Move. Uh, o-okay. What are you looking for? A way out. I don't know. We'll leave the rest of it here until we can come back to get it. Should be safe until we get back... if we get back. We'll be fine. This is gonna work. It's the Bens. You sure you're up for this? They brought the kids into it. Got a hit on Justice's car. Found it at a coffee shop. No other evidence, just Justice's cellphone. They turned it off and threw it in the bushes. Alright, so what's the game plan? We make that bitch pay for what she's done. She wants the money so bad, let's give it to her. - What? - Carlene wants to feel like she's in the driver's seat. Once she's dug in is when she'll call us, but we're gonna get at her first. We get the kids back, and she doesn't get to spend a damn dollar of that money. I don't know, guys. If this goes wrong... - My kids are my life. - And my family is mine. Nobody comes at us without consequences. I'm in. I appreciate you coming with me. Of course, man. Nancy told me what's up. Oh. Not supposed to have that. You being serious right now? Come on. Ah. Fine. Okay, you're definitely not supposed to have that. We're in my world, man, not yours. - You good? - After you. Alright. Be careful with that. - Listen, we need her alive. - Okay. Just here to scare her for information. It's a little too late for that, bro. Oh, shit. Mm. She's breathing. Whoa. What the hell is this?! You know me. You killed my ex-wife. Carlene Hart... she got you out of jail. She told you to lure my daughter to an abduction. Now where are they keeping Izzy? - I don't... - Come on! We are running out of time! Ticktock, you nasty-ass bitch! Do it. Do it. God! I remember how you looked in court... pink dress, flowers on it. You know, trying to play up the innocent schoolteacher angle. See, I could tell. I can always tell when a defendant is truly sorry. You didn't give a shit. No, I don't remember it. - You were drunk. - She still is. It wasn't even really me. But this? This was me. I did this. I just... I just wanted a way out, so I just... Hey, you took Izzy's mom. You can't change that. But you still have time to make this right. Help me find my daughter. Uh, there was... A man came to see me in jail. He said that I could get out on furlough if I helped him do something. I reached out to Isabel... and, uh, set up... set up a meeting. I'm sorry. How'd you contact him? Huh? After you set up Izzy, how'd you get ahold of him? Um, he gave me... he gave me a number. - Okay. - There. Nancy? Yeah, yeah. Hey, we got a number for you to trace. Wakey, wakey, Mr. Doran. Looking for this? You left it next to your burner phone, dumb-dumb. I'm gonna make this real simple for you. You were the go-between for Carlene and Alice. I'm guessing you know where Izzy is. You got the wrong guy. Tell me where my daughter is or I pull the trigger. I've seen her do this before. She's not bluffing. You can't. You're cops. Not tonight. Yeah, your boss, she... she got our badges taken. Even coming in here, you know, we were breaking the law, so we might as well get our money's worth, right? You're full of shit. Now you're blind and deaf on that side. You're not who we're looking for, but if you don't give us answers, I'm gonna take you apart one piece at a time. I'll tell you where Carlene's holding her, you let me walk? Did I stutter? Ah. What's it gonna be, left eye? Agent Hendrix. Glad you're still with us. Oh, really? Do I have a choice? You here to finish me off or what? Always looking for the easy way out. No. I have a proposition. Of course you do. But I'm not listening anymore. My life's been upside down ever since you read me into this damn Knox program. I'm here to get you right-side up. I gave Carlene 48 hours for a quiet escape. Since then, she's kidnapped two children and left a trail of bullets all over Los Angeles. Word on the street is Gabriel Knox is on the run. What use to me is a kingpin gone soft? Carlene's outlived her utility. The best case scenario for both of us now ends with Carlene Hart dead. Our man outside is gonna look the other way in t-minus 5. There's a car in the garage. The location's in the GPS. Take care of our mutual problem, and your slate gets wiped clean. And if I don't? I lost a lot of blood, man. I might just hang this whole thing up. If you don't, Carlene turns State's Evidence, and I'll vouch for every lie she tells. "Crooked DEA agent poses as drug kingpin." Should get you life in federal prison. How much blood you think you'll lose then? Oh. Got it. So you were telling me about being stuck on a boat? Right. So my dad almost started a fire when he was trying to get the boat to power back up. All we got to do is find a positively charged wire and touch it to a non-grounded wire. That's actually really smart... if it wasn't so dumb. - What? - Izzy, we're on a boat. I thought you wanted to cut the power. You want to start a fire? Yeah. Remember, they need us alive. So if we start a fire, they have to get us off the boat, and then we can scream and yell for help and hope that somebody hears us. And if they don't? Then at least we're off the boat and they can't dump us in the middle of the ocean, 'cause once this thing heads for open waters, we're screwed. Okay. So, what do we do? Which one's hot? Which one's not grounded? You're a guy, right? Don't you know about wires and... and stuff? Have you met me? Fine. What's the worse that can happen? Uh... Okay. Alright, you sure you're okay? Look, I'd just feel a lot better if you go see the doctor. Please. Thank you. Let me know when you're all done. I love you. What's up? Michelle's having some bad cramps, but she's gonna go see the doctor. Uh, how you doing? Faith is struggling with it. I'm barely keeping it together, but, you know, I gotta focus on this task at hand, you know? Alright, man, it's all gonna work out. See, I said it, now it's gonna happen. That's how powerful I am. You know, a pretty smart guy told me that once. Pretty smart or pretty brilliant? Hey, Carlene's guy says the kids are being held on a yacht. She's gonna try to flee the country with her family when she gets the money. Over my dead body. I thought we needed Carlene alive to testify. That's still the plan, right? She touches Izzy, I'm-a beat her ass. Look, we got an address. We're gonna do it, we gotta do it now. Let's go. I know, baby. Mommy just needs to finish up a few things, and then we'll all be together again. Yes, yes, even Daddy. We're gonna take the boat out for a while. I know. I know. I love sailing, too. Don't worry, honey, it'll all be over soon. Okay. Kissing hands. Mwah! Mwah! Now put them in your pockets and carry them with you. Okay. Bye. Talbot... I-I don't give a shit. You can start over when we get to Mexico. This was always a possibility. I'll see you in Point Loma. _ It's time. We want our kids back. I want my money. Long Beach aquarium. One hour. Proof of life. You're just gonna have to take my word for it. She wants to meet in an hour. She has no idea we're on her already. We have to go now, catch her off guard. - Dad, you ready to go? - Good to go. Let's do this. Get the kids in the truck. Don't move until my signal. The aquarium should be swarming with children by now. That'll stop them from trying to pull anything. Be smart, or you lose the rest of your cash. I'm confused. Were you trying to say something, or is you pulling a gun on me supposed to mean something to me? Not afraid to die? Y'all tried that, remember? It didn't take. What about your friend's kids? We know they're on the boat. Let 'em go, and we'll talk business. You're a planner, like me. You're too smart to think that I would just give the kids up. So show me my money. I know you brought the rest of it. Fine. I'll do it your way. _ Oh, my God. I got it! - I got it. - Yes, yes, yes! Okay. Ooh! Oh, my God. Nice. Okay. Please don't die. Okay. Um... Alright, Syd's got them distracted. Let's move. You've seen your money. Now Izzy and Justice. You'll see them once my people verified it's all there. Kids first, then you verify. Look, you keep playing hardball, this can go another way. Hey, there's a fire! - Hey, there's a fire in here! - What the hell?! You gotta get us out of here. What did you do? What did you do? - I don't know! It just... - Huh? Aah! I know why you need the money. You got the entire U.S. government and every drug cartel in the western hemisphere looking for you. You won't last a week without it. This cash burns, you're as good as dead! Are you really wiling to gamble with your daughter's life? You willing to gamble with yours? They gotta be below deck. - Izzy, run! - Uhh! - Justice! - Dad! Come on, let's go. Let's go. Aah! Get the money! Get back! Dad! - Are you okay? Huh? - Yeah. - You sure? Huh? - Yeah. Uh, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, I'm good. - Hey, hey, hey. We gotta go. Let's get out of here. Come on. Come on. Get down! - Baines! Yo! - Dad! Oh, my God. Don't let him see me, okay? I don't want my son to see this. - Come on. It's okay. - Unh-unh. What? What? They got me, man. He shot me in the ass. What? Aah! Alright, I thought we were in trouble. Come on, man. Promise me, no dick tubes. I promise, no dick tubes, alright? But we gotta go. - Come on! Let's... let's go. - Aah! We gotta get out of here. Justice, don't look. - I'm not. I'm not. - Come on. Izzy! Izzy! Drop your weapon! You first! This was not my intention! Let Izzy go! Aah! You okay? Yeah. Uhh! You missed a spot. Come on, we've gotta hurry! Aah! - Let's go. - Come on, hurry up! Thing's about to blow! I got her! I got her! Izzy! Izzy! Izzy! We're okay! You good? - You good? - Yeah. A little toasty, but I'm alright. - Oh, my God! - Nancy! Oh! I was so worried. I-I blew up the boat. Oh! They got me, Syd. It's a gusher. Feel it in my socks. Feel it in your socks? - You got no swag, man. - I'm so sorry. I... - It's okay. - I didn't know where you were. I'm just glad you're here. It's fine. Looks like everybody's in one piece, more or less. - Yeah. - Where's Carlene? We can't let her get away! Come on! Go kick her ass. - Are you sure? - Go. We got her, we got her, We got her. Go! - Izzy. Izzy, you good? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Are you good? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good. - I'm so sorry that I brought you and... - No, don't worry about it. But next time, we should do the movies. - I'm not good with this stuff. - Yeah, probably. Okay. You're gonna be shitting like a Play-Doh factory. Hey, man, this is a serious injury... not like when you got shot in your little chicken wing. You know how many muscles are connected to the gluteus? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I'm not gonna be able to sit down for a month. M-M-M-Michelle's in labor. We gotta go to the hospital. - What? It's... It's too early. - We gotta go! We... We... Come on! Let's go to the hospital. Come on, let's go! Get! Whose car is this? I'm gonna run this bitch into a brick wall. Well, try not to kill her. Oh, come on, really? I said try. You know, best efforts. Aah! You should've killed me when you had the chance, Carlene! Who's on who now? Huh?! This ends today. Let her go, Warren! Syd? Walk away. Not gonna happen. I need her alive. We want the same thing... Gabriel Knox dead and buried. Well, she's right here. You've been wanting it for five years. I wanted the person who shot me, and that's you. Is that what she told you? 'Cause that ain't the whole truth. No more lies, Warren. I remember. You were there. You said you "got this", and then you shot me. It was the only way to save you. I saved your life, okay? 'Cause Kobi was trying to kill you. And if I even stuttered, he would've shot me, too. Listen, I gave you a fighting chance. I did what I could. - Carter. - What? Our baby... it was a boy. I was gonna name him Carter. But you killed him. Don't move! You're gonna get us all killed. Because you wouldn't listen to me, Syd. You never listened to me. You left me no choice. You made me do it. Get on your knees! Now. Hands above your head. Aah! You don't know what you're doing. - Uhh! - Shut up! - Out of the way, McKenna. - Not a chance. McKenna, I'll put you down, too. You do what you gotta do. Uhh! Syd... Let's go. Let's get out of here. - Secure that woman. - Yes, sir. Come with me. Put your hands down. - We good? - Good? You blew up the Port of L.A. You're overreacting. You're exaggerating. It was... it was one boat. And the van. - It was our van. - That's true. Please, both of you, just shut up. The Federal government insisted that LAPD step away from this case. Gabriel Knox, Bishop Duval, fentanyl, all of it. And I gave him my word that we would. But then Carlene Hart went and abducted the children of two LAPD detectives... my people. As far as I'm concerned, you two were doing your jobs. If they wanna come after you, they gotta get through me first. Thank you. What you doing here? I went out to get these, and now I'm just taking in the view. What... what... what are you doing up? Oh, man, I can't feel nothin'. They gave me that good shit. It's like watching your heart walk outside your body. And when you have more than one kid, the heart grows and divides evenly. It's crazy, right? What's crazy is you walking around this hospital with half an ass. I wouldn't miss this for the world. - How they doing? - Good. Good. Michelle's blood pressure spiked. They thought it was pre-eclampsia. That's why they induced labor, but no sign of apnea, and the doctor thinks we're clear of BPD. Uh, I volunteered as a baby buddy. - Whaaaaat? - Yeah. Picked up a thing or two. Okay. A'ight. Say what you got to say. I got it coming. I bagged on you about your arm. Look, man... I wouldn't be half the cop I am without you. And I wouldn't be standing here if your ass hadn't saved my ass. So the only thing I got to say to you is... I love you. They got me in the ass, man. - In the ass. - Yeah, I know. - Yeah. - I know. I know. I know. Hey! Congratulations. Welcome to the club, papa bear! Thanks. Well, twins, huh? Yeah. Am I in trouble? No. No, just the opposite. You're a lucky man. What's going on? I'm Special Agent Alber with the DEA. We've never met, Syd, but I've followed your career a while. I've just started following yours. Where's Carlene? Carlene Hart is no longer your problem. What the hell is this? A chance to start over. A clean slate for you and your friends. In exchange for what? Our silence. The Gabriel Knox program, Warren, Carlene... never happened. So this is you saving your own ass. We still have a ton of evidence. We could still blow up your world with or without Carlene. It's not my world that's at stake here. It's yours. You go public, we deny it. It'll be the word of two suspended cops against the Federal government. Any evidence you have was illegally obtained. Inadmissible. Sure, maybe there's an inquiry, hearings in Washington. But we've seen that movie before. Important people want this to go away, so it will. We get a do-over. That... that's what the offer is? It's in all of our interests that this stays out of the public eye. And we're supposed to believe you'll hold up your end of the bargain? That you won't come after us next? We'll take it. Syd. They need this story to go away. Anything happens to us, it just raises more questions. We'll take it. Sounds like we're good.

Looking good, Detective. Had him track my cellphone? - Your watch, actually. - Oh. You've been really getting your steps today. - Not today, Fletch. - Whatever. You know black people don't do well in the rain. - Bye, Syd. - Later, Fletch. So we just gonna stand out here in the rain like a '90s R&B; video? I can give you a ride. Come on. Raid your dad's closet for that coat? This you? Yeah, I figured it was about time I got something that had two seats. - Why you gotta be so extra? - Oh! You mean like "taking a jog in the rain" kinda extra? So... Alber held up his end of the deal, and... you've been dodging me for a couple days. What's going on? Are we good? Yeah. I mean... You saved Izzy. Of course we're good. It's just... Carlene's out there. We don't know if... if she's dead. Did they kill her? Maybe they're protecting her. We'll never know. Syd, she... she came for my family, and I just... I felt so helpless. I'm just trying to figure out how to live with this unfinished business. Yeah. Swish-swish. - Oh, come on. - Swish-swish! - No. - Yes! You of all people. You can't tell me to keep it moving. Come on. I didn't die in Miami, but I sure as hell stopped living. And that's not on them. That's on me. You gave me back something that Warren took from me... A family. So, yeah, I saved Izzy, but you saved me first. They tried like hell to take everything from us, but our family's still here. So... we win. It just, like, purrs. She's a beauty. Maybe I can... - take her for a spin? - No. I'm, like, a legitimately good driver. Have you seen the deductible on this? Jen? Jen, is that you? You know, in this car, we're like an official cop duo, like Starsky and Hutch. Tango and Cash. Or Cagney and Lacey? Turner and Hooch? - I'm Turner. - What? - Why do I gotta be the dog? - 'Cause you're sittin' bitch, bitch. Oh, I hate you. So rude. Hello? Syd, you need to hurry. Something's happened. Dad, what's going on? Just get down here quick. It's Jen. She's dead.
