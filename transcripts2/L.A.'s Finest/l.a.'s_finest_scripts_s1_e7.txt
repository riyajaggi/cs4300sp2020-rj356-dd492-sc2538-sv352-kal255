 Previously on "L.A.'s Finest"... Hey, honey, this is Steven Hines. He was outside when I came back from my run. I was just checking out the old neighborhood. Dante, you need to go. - Who the hell are you? - I heard you were... looking for me. Patel? I'm looking for this dickhead. Name's Arlo. We were hoping to find my stash before you got home. You underestimated her, so, Mr. Knox would prefer I take over the day-to-day.

 - Have I made myself clear? - Yes. - What do you want? - It's what Mr. Knox wants. You're gonna be taught a lesson. I'm coming after someone you care about. You said over the phone something about time, right? 24 hours, give or take. Hey, it's Syd. This is my personal number, how did you get it? I have a knack for finding people. Okay, let's meet. Hey, Kat! I just want to introduce you to Syd. - Syd? - You're not the only one who can find people. - Put it down! - You should answer.

 It's about your son. Dante, there are men here with guns. They are threatening Sam. - What the hell did you just do? - They have my son. Now you can't chase me and save her, can you? Somebody called me. My daughter has been shot. I'm looking for Katherine Vaughn Miller! Kat is your daughter? I'm looking for my daughter! Stop. No. Just listen to me. 36 minutes past the hour. The Russ Carr Morning Show. Good morning, everybody. How you doing? I wonder what he did this time. - Does it matter? - Yes. Nah. They've been like this. I think this one is real, though. What does that mean? Nothing. Just don't look. Here. Look at me. That's dumb. Then why you smiling? I'm not. Fine. Don't do it. Don't smile. Don't smiiiile. Told you you were smiling. You're still dumb. Mom? Not now, baby. We got a long drive. Daddy! Syd. Marcus. We're gonna work this out. Everything is gonna be okay. Daddy, I don't want to go. I'll see you real soon, baby girl. You too, Marcus. I'm gonna come and visit real soon. - I promise. - Yeah. Okay, Dad. Your daughter's out of surgery. We're not completely out of the woods yet. She's young. Strong. Is she gonna be okay? We've done everything we can. At this point, all signs are positive, and there's nothing to do but wait. It'll be a few hours before she's up. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Oxney, please call the page. Oxney, call the page operator. Orderly to ICU. Orderly to ICU, please. I saw her file. Katherine. She's a year older than me. - Syd, I... - I guess we know what the straw was that finally broke Mama's back. I knew you were a cheater. The way Mom always would say, "Don't you ever let a man disrespect you." I figured that's probably why she left you. Talk about disrespect. You made a fool of her. And then what? We left and then you just... slid over to your new family? Is... I mean, how long were me and Marcus gone before you shacked up with that girl and her mother? - It wasn't like that. - Really? 'Cause... how was it? Ple... Please tell me. I remember everything that you said. "I'll come see you, baby girl. I'ma come visit you real soon." I remember it because I... I went over it over and over and over again in my head trying to figure out "What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? What did you..." "Why doesn't he want to come visit?" Syd... I tried. When your mother took you kids to Miami, I became the bad guy. Everything was my fault. I've been looking for ways to tell you. Whatever we got here... our quid pro quo is not exactly a stable relationship. I... Don't put this on me. I didn't make you a bad husband, and I didn't make you a bad father. You created a whole other family. What was Mom supposed to do? Fight. She was supposed to stay and fight. With me, not against me. No. You were supposed to stay and fight! For us. For your family. What kind of man are you? You didn't... you didn't visit. You didn't... you didn't even call. I had to step up for Kat. She was my responsibility. So was I. So was I. Oh, my God. You didn't want me. No... No. You didn't want me. I'm just disposable. Yeah, that's about right. - Where's Zach? - In his room. - What the hell is going on? - Are you both okay? - Are you okay? - No, we're not okay. Men with guns were in this house. - What did you do, Dante? - I want... I want to see him. No. No, no. He's asleep. Stop, stop. You're supposed to be done with all of this. Look, it's not my fault, okay? Of course it's your fault! You and Ray... Look, what I need you to do is get your things together. Oh, I am way ahead of you. I... I am taking Zach to my aunt's in Scottsdale. He's my son. You can't just take him away from me. Yes, I can. The judge said I could. The only reason I stuck around here was so that I didn't have to do this on my own. - Please. - I was so stupid. What is it... what is it that you want me to do, huh? What is it that you want me to do? You tell me what that is that you want me to do and I can do it for you. You can say goodbye to your son. No! You will not take my son away from me. After men with guns came to my house? I won't. Go say goodbye to your son. We're leaving. You want me to help you with that? Which one of you is the lifeguard? Stop! Wait! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop! Get out of here. Just go. Patch me up, Baywatch. Synced & corrected by kinglouisxx www.addic7ed.com Hey. Brought you a change of clothes. Oncology to west ward. Oncology to west. I know when all of this is behind us, we're gonna have to talk about the... vibrator I saw in your locker. I'm a self-soother. Want to talk about it? My vibrator? No. Emotions. Oh. Ugh. Oof. Joseph had a daughter. She's my... half-sister. I have a half-sister. Wow. This is so embarrassing. Sorry. You know, my... my mom used to... beat the crap out of us, me and my little brother, Nico. I could take it, you know? I was a tough kid, but... Nico was soft. I don't know. I guess, um... I'm just telling you that you're not alone. I mean, you're literally not alone. Your sister's like right down the hall. Too soon? Oh, God. Is she gonna be okay? That's what they say. I'm losing. No. Your sister's still alive. He did not take her from you. He failed. You don't understand. It's not what Knox tried to take from me. That's not what hurts. It's what she took from me. Joseph stayed here. She was good enough to raise. Not me. She got the life I was supposed to live. She took my dad. What do you want me to do? Find Arlo. Done. Aah! Wow. What a night. Time to get moving. All the gauze. Anything with blood on it. There. In the trash. Now dump the vodka on it. Now, what do you with you? Just go. The bandage will hold until tonight, but you should get to a hospital. Aw, that's no fun. I know. Let's play a game. Just let us go. Please. Let you go? Hmm, nah. But... You win this game... No! Please! ...and your boyfriend lives. No, no. Please don't. How about... Rock, Paper, Scissors? What? Let's go. Hands up. - Please... - Play or he dies! I'm cool either way. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. You're lucky. Grab your keys. Let's go. Just take it. I can't drive. What? A lot of people don't. Whatever! Let's go! Mr. Duvall, you never struck me as a patron of the arts. This place is fantastic. If these walls could talk. Imagine what they've seen. History is our greatest teacher. I can make some calls about achieving landmark status - with the city, if you... - You know, my great-grandfather made his nut in burlesque shows. I'm thinking about reviving the family business. Live sex shows on the stage, chicks in cages up the wings. Maybe even something with animals in the back. But you didn't come here to discuss that revenue stream, did you? I came here to discuss you getting cold feet about being our supplier. I've got to be honest, your lack of faith is incredibly disheartening. Mr. Knox will be disappointed, too. He lost the stash house. The police confiscated $20 million in product. And your associate, Kobi, was killed in a DEA raid. Gabriel Knox's ambitions were perhaps a... a tad larger than his abilities. His West Coast expansion has been, uh... rocky. I know how it looks, but you have to understand... It looks like my product might be better served with a different distributor. These are minor setbacks. Any more minor setbacks, and we'll be happy to take our business elsewhere. Mr. Duvall... you must understand... Please. Call me Bishop. Bishop. In times like these, you have to... I need to take this. You look upset. Perhaps Mr. Knox should have chosen someone a little less... emotional for this job. We will earn your trust back in short order. I guarantee it. I hope so. It takes balls to do this job. ...all the exculpatory evidence. Don't wait till "ready for trial." I want this conviction straight up. Here's the Santa Monica update you asked for. Any leads? Yeah, CCTV of a man feeling the scene. Son of a bitch. You know him? Thanks for this, Malcolm. That'll be all. Yo. McKenna. We just got an assault/robbery at a lifeguard tower. Possible kidnapping. Santa Monica PD is kicking at us because you're BOLO. Might be your shooter. Let's roll. Alright. Anything you want to tell us about this Santa Monica thing before we get there? No. Let's just get this guy. Hey, I don't know what y'all got into out there, and I don't know what's going on with Syd, but it feels like we're walking into something. Look, we didn't exactly follow protocol, and now that guy is out there. People are in danger. I want to make it right. Alright, look. We got your back. But we need to hear the whole story when this case is over. Okay. Hey. We need to talk. Why didn't you tell me that Steven Hines was at the Santa Monica shooting? - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. He's a suspect in the shooting. He wasn't the shooter. How do you know that? Because I do. Then I assume you also know that "Steven Hines" doesn't actually exist. What's his real name? Dante Sherman. He's a... C.I. of mine. Your C.I.? Jesus, Nancy. He was in our house. I was gonna tell you when he crashed your press event. He was pissed because some information he told me got someone hurt. I just didn't know how to say it. I don't know. I don't know. Try... try that "A dangerous criminal is crashing into our lives because he's pissed about something." Maybe that. He's a confidential informant. I'm not supposed to talk about them. I have every right to know about confidential informants! I am the god damn district attorney! Sorry. What else do I need to know? Nothing. Nancy, tell me the truth. It's just a case. Attending nurse, Room 14. Attending nurse, Room 14. Been looking for you. What did your mother do for a living? - Excuse me? - She was a preschool teacher. Do you know what a preschool teacher makes a year? What are you talking about? You remember your house in Miami? Do you have any idea what the mortgage on that house was? Do you remember wanting anything? A bike? Dance classes? Summer camp? Did your mother ever tell you no? Where do you think that money came from, Syd? Money isn't a father. Do you think about the life you had? Your mother did not provide that alone, okay? And don't you tell me that I didn't want you. You were a child living in your mother's house. You saw things one way. Now you're an adult. So, grow up. Grow up? I did. And I was wondering where the hell you went. It's not that simple, Sydney. That's what I'm trying to show you. It actually is that simple. Either you have a dad or you don't. Don't act like you didn't have a choice. You could've... you should have been there. Well, don't you think I know that?! Baby, can you just stop hating me for one minute and listen to what I'm trying to tell you? I wanted to be there for you. I wanted to. But I couldn't. Mr. Vaughn. She's awake. I... I got to go. Yeah. Go. So, what time did you and... um... I want to say Becky. No. Betsey? Wait, you don't... you don't know her name? We were just hooking up. I met her at a bar up the beach. She... said she knew of a quiet place. Next thing I knew, I was getting my face smashed in by some guy with a gun. I woke up and he was still there. He made her get her keys and they left. I called 911. Yo. Lifeguard office says that our girl is Rebecca Arnold. Becky. I knew it was Becky. What a dick. I need an extraction. No kidding, Arlo. I heard all about your mess, and you literally couldn't have picked a worse day to keep being you. Were my instructions not clear before? I did what you said! I-I made the offer! I did not tell you to play mind games with her. Or give you intel on her sister so you could put a bullet in her in full view of two dozen witnesses. She was supposed to be leverage. You don't kill leverage, Arlo. Burnett started all of this. And I'm finishing it. Please. M... Ms. Hart. Y-You're overreacting. Watch it, Arlo, or you'll be the second man today who has told me how I'm feeling. Look, I-I didn't... I didn't mean to... Mr. Knox is done with you. Done? Wait. N-n-no. Ms.... Ms. Hart, you... You got to talk to him. I can make this right. You've said that before. He'll... he'll go after my parents. He'll kill everybody I know just to make sure the next guy knows exactly what'll happen if he messes up. Please. I-I can fix this. I-I'm begging you. I'll talk to Mr. Knox. But in the meantime, for the love of God, lay low. No more dead bodies. I promise. Thank you. Aw, balls. Hey! Hi! Hi, sweetie. It's for you, Mommy. Katelyn, did you draw that by yourself? Yeah. Honey, it's beautiful. Hey. I'm here. Hi, Daddy. I brought you some things. Thank you. Hi. Hi, Katherine. Are you up to talking? I need to ask a few questions. How do you know Arlo? I don't. He called you by name and you came over. He spent the day buying a bracelet at my jewelry shop. How do you know him? He said he was going to hurt someone close to me. I... I'm sorry. - I didn't... - You didn't know. - No. - Syd. Do we have to do this now? Kat needs her rest. No. We need to talk. Alone. Okay. You must be wondering how I knew who you were. Yeah. At first, when I was little, I didn't know Dad. I just thought he was one of my mom's friends. And then when my mom died, I learned that Joe was actually my father. But I knew he had kids. So, when I got older, I did a little social media stalking. I was curious. But I never reached out. He ever talk about me? No. I think it was too painful for him. But you do have his eyes. My eyes. Can you see that? You may think that you know me 'cause you saw some pictures of me online. When I look at you, I don't feel anything. You're nothing to me. My dad screwed your mom. Doesn't make us family. Whoa! Hey! What's going on? Nothing. I got to go. Please, don't. Don't. I, uh... Look, I... I brought some things for Kat. But I also brought something for you, - something you should... - Keep it. Come on, please, just look inside. Please? Have a seat, come on. I, uh... I saved everything. At first out of anger, spite, but then as years went on I realized I was saving it for me, to remind myself of the kind of man I was no matter what your mother said. LAX to Miami? I tried to be there for you, Syd, but your mother wouldn't have it. So, what's this supposed to prove? I was there. Look. Dance recitals, basketball games, graduation. I showed up, but your mother turned me away. She called the cops on me... a couple of times. She did not want me in your lives. You never seemed to care what mom wanted before. Why... Why would you back down when it came to your kids? Our marriage wasn't perfect, but we tried. Then when I slipped, I... Is that what you're calling it? Hey. When I cheated on your mother, the only way she could make me understand how bad I hurt her was to take my world away... you and your brother. I broke her heart, so... she took mine. Eventually I realized that my showing up was only hurting her more, so I stopped. I just... let her have her revenge. So if I called Mom right now and asked her about all these trips and her turning you away, what would she say? She'd tell you she's sorry. Listen, I... I didn't tell you this so you'd be mad with your mother. I just... I just want you to know the truth. Grandpa! Whoa! Who let my grandbabies in here? Hey, look at you, boy. You getting so big, I can barely pick you up. Hey, son. How you doing? - You okay? - Good. How you doing, boy? Look at you! Yeah, this is it. It's registered to Rebecca Arnold. Yeah, where is she? There's a lot of blood up here. Pop the trunk. Detectives! You're gonna want to hear this. Looks like we got something. I saw it! He put the gun right to her head, and then he shot that poor girl. Okay, well, can you describe the shooter, please? Short. Brown, long hair. Do you know where he went? I thought for sure he was gonna steal the car. I mean, why else would he kill that girl? But he just... put her in the trunk. He looked around... he didn't see me, nobody sees me... but I watched him. He just looked at his phone until a different car showed up. That's it? Yeah, that's it. He just looked at his phone? You said he's a millennial douchebag. - He took a Phast. - Yep. - Let's go. Thank you. - Thank you. I don't care what the normal lead time is. I asked for the files an hour ago. No, you don't have to ask your boss, 'cause I'm his boss. Send them now. Thank you. I told you, it's a long shot. It's the only shot I got. Wait. There, in the center. That's it. That's it. That's the same tattoo I saw on the sniper's neck. I knew I remembered it. From prison? Yeah, yeah, you been inside? No, I've never been to prison. Well, your line of work, you will. Now, when you're inside, you learn things... who to sit with, who to talk to, and the quickest way to do that is to clock the tattoos. Now, the only gang that has that tattoo is from Victorville. It's the Princes. So... Look. If I do this, you got to erase my number, okay? You're in way too deep. Okay. There. That's the one. I want Arlo. Dante? I'm coming for you. And when I find you, you're gonna beg for your life. And then you're gonna beg me to let you die. What is going on?! Oh, yeah. Got him. Tracked him to his last Phast ride. He took a Phast ride? Kids these days. The kid is a homicidal maniac. Yeah, no kidding. He already killed one girl... the lifeguard who patched him up. We got to get to that driver before it's too late. Alright, keep me posted. How's it going over there? Bad. Syd, she died? No, she didn't. I guess it could be worse. Hey, I got to go. Uh, let me know when you find Arlo. Copy that. Hey. They told me I'd find you out here. You want to talk? No. Okay. We'll just stand here, then... silent. Look, Syd, I just wanted to check up on you, you know? Make sure you're okay. Whatever you need, anything. Anything except silence? - Right? - Okay. Why'd you come up here, Warren? 'Cause I need the truth. Why were you in Santa Monica, Syd? There was a sniper, and I know there's more to the story than what McKenna fed the first responders. I was there to meet Max's guy, Arlo. Okay, but we have a whole task force now, Syd. Why go at it alone? I'm not alone anymore. I got McKenna. Yeah... I saw your pops inside. I see you got him in your corner now, too. I wouldn't exactly say that. Look, Syd... I know it's none of my business, but for whatever it's worth, you should probably cut your old man some slack. I mean, last time I saw him, he was tied up in knots, the same way he is now, worried about you. What are you talking about? Okay, so when the Knox thing happened, you were in a coma for about a week, and he was right there sitting at your bedside, crying his eyes out. And I was there when Marcus found your father sitting right at your bedside, and he made him go. It got ugly. But like I said, it wasn't my job to get involved in family business. Look, Syd, you got people that care about you. Just let them. Mr. Kaufman, Computer Crimes Unit's pinged your phone. We need to know about one of your fares. You think just 'cause you're the man I have to answer your questions? Well... yeah. Can you step out, please? Small guy, long hair. This is an invasion of my rights, invasion of privacy. I don't consent. Big Brother can't just track my movements. Actually, you did consent when you signed up to be a Phast driver, alright? It's literally in the contract. You didn't read me my rights. - You're not under arrest. - Yet. This is starting to feel like delaying and obstructing an official investigation. You know what, let's just tow his car. We'll impound it while we pull the suspect's DNA. This is the last driver. So unless you want us to charge you with accessory after the fact, tell us where you dropped him off. You have got to be kidding me. Come on! Come on! Get up! Who are you?! What do you want?! Don't kill me. You can have anything. How about your life back, huh? Damn. We gonna split up, or what? Inside a factory that's clearly haunted? Yeah, sure. - What's the worse that could happen? - Why would you say that? Yo, 100 bucks says there's a pile of dead clowns in there. Come on, man. Why would you go there with me? You know my thing about clowns. ♪ Do do do-do-do, do-do-do do-do ♪ Stop it! Save me. The human piano keys driving you nuts? You have no idea. I hate being on the sidelines. I should be out there with you. Well, as soon as we bust Arlo, you can. So I can go home and shower the smell of moron off me. You saw what happened to Ray when he crossed Mr. Knox. Let me live, and you can have everything you had before your dickhead brother got you mixed up in all of this. Let me tell you about my brother, dickhead. You know, Ray just always accepted who we were. I just never listened. Well, I'm listening now. It's time I started acting like Ray. I just want to say, I really appreciate everything. Yeah, I got you. I got to go. - LAPD! - Drop the gun! Dante. McKenna, what's going on? Do you know this guy? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? Yeah. With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me? You? No. Warren told me about Miami. He's a good man. I know this is the second time you've had to come see your daughter in an ICU because of something Gabriel Knox did. I took it too far. I know that. I'm really, really sorry. No. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. Come on, don't. Don't be. Don't be. I got a long way to go. So what do we do now? Listen, we uh... figure out who did this and make sure they never hurt us again. Yeah, that too, Dad. But I was talking about this whole family situation. - Oh. - Oh. Oh! - Okay, well... - Yeah. - We're gonna work on it. - Yeah. I need you to stall on the paperwork. - What? - Just drag your feet. You can't process it yet. Of course we can. He's under arrest. No, no. That's not what I mean. You guys need to book him. I can't do that. But just stall. What the hell is going on? Patrick was all over this earlier, and he... - He's gonna find out... - Okay, look, I'm not trying to get into your marriage, right? But whatever you and Syd got going on, you been sneaking around here, keeping secrets for weeks. Now, I'm your boy, but I can only look the other way for so much before I have to tap out. You obviously know this Dante guy. 'Cause clearly he had something to do with what went down in Santa Monica, and I'd be willing to bet that this is what Calloway's all over our asses about. Look, I-I will tell you guys the truth about everything, but it can't be right now. Fine. We'll run interference. You better come in here tomorrow dropping truth bombs. Thank you. Hi. Hey. I thought you left. - I asked her to stay. - Daddy. Look, I know what she said and I know why she said it, but you two need to talk. We don't have to do this. No, you can come in. You sure? What else am I gonna do tonight? What you want to talk about? Tell me about Joseph. Was he a good father? Actually, not really. We had a terrible relationship. We didn't work things out until I was in my 20s. Really? Yeah, you probably built this picture in your head of the perfect life with Daddy. - Yep. - I get it. I thought the same thing about you and your mom. But just think about it, I mean, he was a single dad. He really wasn't around in the beginning, and then when he was... well, you know him. How was he when you were a kid? Rough. The man was rough. Yeah. But he cared. That's Daddy. Same guy. Did he used to smoke cigars? I used to love the way the yard smelled after he'd fire one up after work. I still like the smell of cigars. That house used to reek of it. Cigar smoke makes me sick to my stomach to this day. And what else? Tell me something else. Uh... he used to love Lola Falana. Word. And, uh, he used to smoke these cool... You ready to be honest with me? Dante Sherman... who is he to you?
