 The view from Vale's got nothing on this! Ooh! Ooh! Sis! That kid has a collapsible staff! And she's got a fire sword! Ow, ow... Easy there, little sister. They're just weapons. Just weapons? They're an extension of ourselves! They're a part of us! They're so cool! Well why can't you swoon over your own weapon? Aren't you happy with it? Of course I'm happy with Cresent Rose! I just really like seeing new ones.

 It's like meeting new people. But better. Ruby, come on, why don't you go try and make some friends of your own? But why would I need friends when I have you? Well... Actually, my friends are here. Gotta go catch up. 'Kay, c'ya, bye. Wait! Where are you going? Are we supposed to go to our dorms? Where are our dorms? ...Do we have dorms? I don't know what I'm doing... What are you doing!? Uh... sorry. Sorry? Do you have any idea of the damage you could've caused? Uhh... Gimme that! This is Dust mined and purified from the Schnee Quarry. Uhh... What are you, brain dead? Dust! Fire, Water, Lightning, energy! Uhhh... Are you even listening to me? Is any of this sinking in? What do you have to say for yourself!? Uhhhhaaaahhh-Chooooo! Unbelievable! This is exactly the kind of thing I was talking about! I'm really, really sorry! Ugh! You complete, dolt! What are you even doing here? Aren't you a little young to be attending Beacon? Well... I... This isn't your ordinary combat school. It's not just sparring and practice you know. We're here to fight monsters! So watch where you're going! Hey, I said I was sorry, Princess! It's Heiress, actually. Weiss Schnee, heiress to the Schnee Dust Company, one of the largest producers of energy propellant in the world. Finally, some recognition! The same company infamous for its controversial labor forces and questionable business partners. What-How dare...! The nerve of...! Ugh! I promise I'll make this up to you! I guess I'm not the only one having a rough first day. So what's...? Welcome to Beacon... Hey... I'm Jaune. Ruby. Aren't you the guy that threw up on the ship? All I'm saying is that motion sickness is a much more common problem than people let on! Look, I'm sorry Vomit-boy was the first thing that came to mind. Oh yeah, what it I called you Crater-face? Hey, that explosion was an accident. Well the name's Jaune Arc! Short, sweet, rolls off the tongue, ladies love it! Do they? They will. Well, I hope they will... I mean, my mom always says that... Never mind. So I got this thing. Whoa! Is that a scythe! It's also a customizable, high impact velocity sniper rifle. A wha-? It's also a gun. Oh. That's cool! So what've you got? Oh-uh, I got this sword. Oooooooh! Yeah, I've got a shield too! So what do they do? Well... the shield gets smaller... So... when I get tired of carrying it... I can just put it away. But wouldn't it weigh the same? Yeah, it does. Well, I'm kind of a dork when it comes to weapons. I guess I did go a little overboard designing it. Wait. You made that? Of course! All students at Signal forge their own weapons. Didn't you make yours? It's a hand-me-down. My great-great-grandfather used it to fight in the war. ...sounds more like a family heirloom to me! Well I like it! Not many people have an appreciation for the classics these days. Yeah. The classics. So why'd you help me out back there, in the courtyard? Eh, why not? My mom always says, "Strangers are just friends you haven't met yet." Hmmm... Hey, where are we going? Oh, I dunno, I was following you. You think there might be a directory? Maybe a food court? Some sort of recognizable landmark? Is uh... Is that a "no"? That's a "no". ♪ I may fall, ♪ ♪ But not like this: It won't be by your hand. ♪ ♪ I may fall, ♪ ♪ Not this place; not today ♪ ♪ I may fall, ♪
