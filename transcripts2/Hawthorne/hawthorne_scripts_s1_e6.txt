 Already? I left 10 minutes ago. Well, I wouldn't know. See, when a child leaves their home, they're obligated to say goodbye. I shouted goodbye. It's not my fault you were singing too loud to hear me over your off-key "Purple Rain," whatever that was. Hey, don't go knocking my Prince impersonation, and, excuse me, is that a boy I hear with you? Wow. You should be like a telephone detective. Can I assume you are library-bound?

 Assume away. Hey, Camille, don't mess with me. I expect a full weekend of studying. All right? These midterms count. Excuse me. Did I not just pull A's on my trig and history quizzes? Oh, yeah, well, I tell you what... You better keep those grades up, or I'm gonna be shouting a lot more than "Purple Rain." Transcripted on addic7ed by chamallow35 Hey, Candy, what happened? What's going on? Morrissey happened. Help? Christina? Okay, you know what? Let me get right back to you. I'll be right with you. I need morphine and bandages here!

 Oh, no, just see how many beds are available and how many nurses are on deck that can cover. Yep. Okay, thanks. Nobody said anything about nuclear armageddon on the radio. Apparently sacred heart pulled the plug on their ER. These are all sacred heart patients? Ours now. Lucky us. You can tell your friend Morrissey next time he calls us in two hours before a shift, he can expect an ass-kicking. Not from me, per se, but from the union. You all got early shift calls? You didn't? We only need additional staff on the early side. I decided to let you sleep. So you opened our doors to every ER. Patient in Virginia. We had no choice. It's called rising to the occasion. What exactly is the occasion? The city pulled the plug on Sacred Heart's emergency services. When a hospital can't meet its budget, it's sold for parts. I told the mayor we'd take the inventory. Are we talking about people or washing machines? Is that all? I imagine your services are need downstairs. I imagine you're right, but if you're gonna double my patient capacity, please double my staff. Save your breath. I can hear the rest of this speech in my head. And you're not entirely wrong. We're... we're treading water a little bit. We're drowning. Fortunately, we have experienced caregivers who will get through this when they accept the circumstances and focus on the work... Starting with yourself. I'm gonna have to consult Dr. Wakefield on this one. Be my guest. I've spoken to Tom, and he's on board. Tom. Good morning, sunshine. Did you sign off on this? I guess I know where you stand. This is ridiculous, and you know it. Look, sacred heart got stuck. We fell on the grenade. You know what? These patients could be split up in every hospital all over the city. All right, this is Morrissey fueling his ego. I'm pretty sure his tank's already full. So you think I'm overreacting? No, I... I think this sucks, but it is what it is. Well, you got the "suck" part right. Move that gentleman out of the walkway, please! Gentlewoman. Sorry, ma'am. Little distracted. Hey. You available? Not even close. What do you got? 26-year-old male, fell off a roof. Arm and leg deformity, head injury. Sold. Slide him over there. Wow, you're easy. Hey, unit three guys need a hand over in the lobby. Hey, Rose. Cool if we leave our stuff? Apparently I'm easy. Flirty much? Not happening. Oh, that's a shame. Where's Kelly? Bar Mitzvah in Bethesda. Ah, mazel tov! All right, if we're gonna work this out, we gonna have to think it out, possibly get a satellite upstairs. Make it work? You strike out with Morrissey? I didn't "strike out." I'm just gonna work it out. You struck out. Ooh, pretty nasty gash. What'd you do... head-butt an ice pick? Rollerblade wipeout. No helmet? Don't get me started. Is this totally hurting? It's not the best feeling in the world. You know what? I can get you some painkillers. I'd like you to get us a doctor. Dad. Don't "dad" me. I'd like some expertise. No offense. Oh, I think a little. Thanks. Camille? What are you doing? Uh, mom, this is Ryan. Your study partner? Yes, actually, but his chest is, like, on fire. I get heartburn, but this is... pretty intense. All right, let's have a seat. How'd you get here? I drove Ryan's car. A permit is practically a license. Camille, are you trying to be punished? It was an emergency. You ever hear of 911? Hey, Tom, give me a sec? Hey, Camille. What do you got? This is Ryan. He's having chest pains. He's feverish. His heart rate is 110. His pupils are constricted. All right, take a deep breath for me. Again... Little funky in there. You feeling any numbness or tingling in your fingers? No. Are you on any medication? Did you ingest anything weird I should know about? Couple pop-tarts. The breakfast of champions. I'll grab an EKG. All right, thanks. All right, Ryan, I'm gonna need you to call your parents. I'd rather them think I was at the library. I'd rather them think you were at the library also, but you're not. So I need you to call them, or else I'll have to. Okay? Okay. Camille. I'll get you some bus fare, and goodbye. No chance. Listen, I don't know what's going on with your friend, okay, but I know you haven't studied today. All right, I got him. He's in good hands. Mom, he's not just a study partner. Since when? There's nothing going on. I just... I care about him. All right, you can hang out with him until his parents show up. Then study. Okay? Code pink, N.I.C.U. Code pink, N.I.C.U. Moses? M... Moses! Moses! Moses? Isabel? C... Christina, they took my baby. I can't find moses. Okay, calm down. Just let me figure this out, all right? Let me figure this out. Isabel's baby, Moses... Discharged last night to a foster family. Discharged? W... where's my child? Okay. Listen. Look at me. I need you to calm down. Look at me. He's been moved. He's fine. Now, I need for you to go to work right now. Mike, take your hand off that taser, please. Thank you. Christina, you'll track him down, right? Of course. Okay, I got this. Trust me. Go. Why wasn't I notified? Why would you be? Why wasn't she notified? Because I'm the devil. Look... they're a nice couple. They're veteran foster parents. They've even dealt with spina bifida... They know the P.T. regimen. Isabel should be grateful. I'll tell her you said so. Okay, next... Three precipitating events giving rise to World War I. Yeah, um... "take me out"? Oh, I'm not asking you to take me out. It's the song... "take me out." Scottish band... Uh, assassination of the archduke Franz Ferdinand. But we could, you know... Go out. Yeah, maybe. Uh, okay, moving on... Can you give me a second one, please? Oh, my God. Ryan. Bobbie! Help! Please, help! He's not breathing. No pulse... On the floor! Defibrillator! It's 582! Mom... Crash cart! Coming in! Okay. All right, let's move everybody out of here. Clear this hallway, please. Clear it out now. Camille. 360. Charging to 360. Clear! Come on, people, let's move. I need for you to wait for me in the waiting room. I need a word with you. I can't now. He'll be fine. Go! Go! Clear! Yeah, we got it. Heart rate 120. Load him up on amiodarone. Where are you taking these patients? Out of here. This is a trauma unit. We're trying to save the boy's life. We're trying to save all these lives. By piling them up to the ceiling? Serving more patients per hour is the reality. These patients stay. You heard him. They stay. Just work it out. How can I help? You can figure out how to ship that son of a bitch back upstairs. One thing at a time, huh? Yeah, well, first things first. We have to figure out how a 16-year-old goes into cardiac arrest. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Speed? How well does Camille know this guy? I don't know, but I'm about to find out. He's stable, at least, so breathe. Okay? Look, I need to ask you a question. Can you be honest with me? Am I sleeping with him? No. Uh, not exactly where I was headed, but good to know. Is there any chance that Ryan could be on anything? Drugs? Mom, you are so clich?. A 16-year-old boy doesn't go into cardiac arrest for nothing. Yeah, well, he gets heartburn all the time, so maybe he has some sort of sickness he doesn't know about. Maybe, but the tox screen will be back soon enough. Blood work does not lie. And I do? Hope not. Excuse me. Uh, not a good time, man. Grant Moore, times-dispatch. I'm covering the Sacred Heart shutdown. It seems that Richmond Trinity is carrying all the weight. Oh, you think, huh? So you're not happy about it? Sure. Of course I am. I love impossible work assignments. After shift, I'm thinking of heading up to D.C., maybe end the war and balance the budget. So, that's Sein... S- t-e-i-n? No! No, he's off. All right? I'm another guy. Got it? Look, if you want to go strictly off-record, that's fine by me. I'm prepared to blow the lid off this place. I just need a source to shadow. Shadow away. It's 45 minutes already. Oh, I know. I'm sorry. They got the heat on in here? Turn it up a bit, I could poach an egg in my pants. Yum. Uh, I think maintenance is getting on that right now. Are you okay? I'll be okay when you get a doctor to see my kid. Do we see Morrissey anywhere? We do not. Great. Let's lose half of these patients. Where do I put them? In the cafeteria if we have to. We'll have some nurses and orderlies rotate through. Check. All right. I thought you took off. Uh, heading out. Did you put my gear somewhere? Hmm? No. Well, I... I left you everything when I ran upstairs. Oh, then I got called into a case. You look behind my desk? Uh, it was right here. I got my wallet and my keys in the bag. What are you doing leaving that stuff in your bag? You were watching my bag. I was nursing. Okay. Standard nurse-to-patient ratio in the ER. is 1-to-4. I'm at 1-to-6. Wow, that's outrageous. Yeah, it's ridiculous. Hang on a sec. Hey. Hey. See this guy over here? Yeah? He's with the dispatch. He's doing an expos? about this place for the Sunday Paper. I'm his deep throat. No, his... you know, his guy. His... his contact. Don't you think it's a little reckless? Because Morrissey finds out, and you are so fired. Bring it on. Seriously. You fire the whistle-blower, you just dig the hole deeper. I'm telling you now... I will bring this place down. Good luck with that. Good luck. Mom, these are Ryan's parents. I'm so sorry to have to meet you under these circumstances. He is stable. Where is he? I need to see him. He's being transferred to the P.I.C.U., so it'll be about 10 minutes. He's okay. Can I at least see his chart? Sure. I'll page the doctor. My husband's an E.N.T., and I'm a psychologist. We know how to read a chart. Christina! Did you find Moses? Just give me one second, okay? Um, I can get you the chart, or I can just tell you what happened... Ryan came in here with chest pains and soon after went into cardiac arrest. That seems unlikely. I know, but unfortunately, that's exactly what happened. Nurse Hawthorne? I don't doubt they told you that, but I can just take one look at this place and see that the level of expertise is less than stellar. Christina. Isabel, one second, please, okay? Um, I know we look swamped here, but I can assure you I have an excellent staff. Nurse Hawthorne, where are the orderlies taking these patients? Morrissey, just give me one second. The chart, please. Liz, please go with them to P.I.C.U. and find the chart. Christina... Isabel, he's been discharged. He's in a foster home. They found a qualified family. He was released last night. Nurse Hawthorne? Released? H... how could he be released? We talked about this. Okay, we always knew this was the plan. No, you didn't say he'd just be gone! I didn't expect for it to happen like this. Christina, you promised me you was gonna have my back. Isabel, I do have your back. No, you do not! I've got words to say to my son before he goes. H... how do you discharge a baby when his mother's not there to explain, to tell him her side, to tell him her piece?! Christina, a mother gets to say goodbye! He's mine! I'm so sorry. When did I know? Um, well, my mother breast-fed me till I turned 4... Which I suppose is a... is a long time. You know, maybe it's even a little bit creepy, but I can't help but feel that her instinct to nourish me... God bless her... to just let me suckle to my heart's content, that that instilled me with a desire to nurse. Not nurse in the breast sense, but nurse... Blood bank, room 221. Any luck? Screw it. We'll go back to base and get a replacement set. And pay 600 bucks? Loss is coming right out of our pocket. I'm so sorry. As soon as I break, I'll help look, okay? Yeah. He's got an irregular heartbeat, which I hoped was isolated to the cardiac episode, but now that he's stabilized, it's clear that Ryan has electrical dysrhythmia. His pediatrician never detected it. Well, it could have manifested in puberty. The real problem is that his condition doesn't entirely explain the cardiac arrest. Why not? Well, because teenagers don't go into cardiac arrest... Even those with abnormal heart rhythms. What are you insinuating? That Ryan could be on a stimulant. Uh, speed in particular. Oh, please. We'll get the tox screen back soon enough. But in the meantime, we can't be sure that Ryan won't relapse. So, just to be safe, I'd like to nip it in the bud. Are you familiar with cardio ablation? Vaguely. I'm an E.N.T., not a cardiologist. Well, it's relatively non-invasive. We insert a catheter and basically just short-circuit the damaged heart tissue. This is nonsense. I want a second opinion. I'll call down the electrophysiologist. But you can expect the same "nonsense" from him. Excuse me. Look, I don't know your son, and I'm not trying to accuse him of anything. But from parent to parent, I would just have a conversation with him. You're right. You don't know our son. Lucky for you I just had my cosmetic surgery rotation. But we are looking at about 25 stitches. You know, we'll put a local anesthetic. You won't even know it's happening. Okay, cool. Did you get a chance to eat something? I had a big breakfast. Grand slam. And you're sure you don't feel light-headed at all? Would you give it a rest? Can we get on with this? She's been sitting here for three hours. I'm gonna be right back. Doctor, um, could you take a look at the dad? He's all flushed and jittery. Yeah, he's probably stressed out. Get him some water and tell him to sit down. No, you're being way too hard on yourself. No. This one's on me. I screwed up. I let her down. You didn't see it coming any better than Isabel did. Bobbie, she didn't depend on the social worker, she depended on me... To take care of her and that baby boy, and I didn't. So make it right. Sorry. I've been meaning to break, but it keeps piling up. Forget it. You look in storage? Break room? Cancel credit cards and all that? Yes. Dude. I am sorry. I took responsibility, then flaked, and it is my bad. I'm happy to pay for the replacement. That's not necessary. You look in the stairwell? Yes. Okay. So this is where people come and sit and eat, huh? You don't eat? Actually, I love to eat. I just never get a chance to sit. Said super-nurse to the lazy bureaucrat. Take two. Susan, I'm sorry that I got in your face about Isabel and Moses. All right? I know you were just doing your job. And you have a lot on your plate. I should have checked in with you. Apology accepted. Barely. Thank you. There's more? A favor? You're something else. Yes? An e-mail, a phone number... any type of contact for Isabel. You got pretty hands. I got a friend who can give you a free manicure. And a free pedicure. And come to you. Could use a manicure. All right, I'll call you back. No, I hear you... Christina! Yeah? Tox screen came back. And? Mr. Pop-tart's full of crap. Speed? In a sense. Adderall. The A.D. drug? Yeah. Kids use it as a brain stimulant to study, power through exams. So much for coffee and nodoz, huh? Yeah. Thanks. You're welcome. Did you know he was using? You make it sound like it's heroin. It's a very powerful drug, Camille, that very likely gave this little boy a heart attack, so did you know? No, okay? No. Are you using? Of course not. You know, 'cause I can't help but think about all these straight A's you've been bringing home after a semester and a half full of C's. Of course. How else could I get a good grade? So is it just a coincidence that all of a sudden you're a straight-a student and your little boyfriend is self-medicating? He's not my boyfriend. He's my friend. Whatever. Not whatever! You're not even listening to me. How can you ask me all of these questions and then just not accept my answers? Camille, because you lie to me all the time, okay? And you're not even good at it, so I question everything. I'm not on drugs. Any drugs. Okay. We're gonna find out. Follow the instructions. I'll wait. You're kidding. Oh, no. I'm dead serious. I... I already told you that I'm not on drugs. I got to do my job as a parent. That boy almost died. If you make me do this, you are seriously damaging our relationship. Pee. So, Ryan is not diagnosed for ADHD? Ryan, where would you have even gotten your hands on something like that? It's as available as any street drug. It's everywhere. I want to speak to Camille. About what, exactly? About how my well-adjusted, sociable, never-once-in-trouble son out of the blue nearly overdoses in your hospital. He didn't overdose here, and your son has to be responsible for his own actions. I know about your daughter. She is a troublemaker. She has fast friends. Watch yourself, because you don't know my daughter. She didn't have anything to do with this. How do you know that? Because I know. Enough! We're leaving. Get us discharge forms. I'm calling an ambulance. To go where? St. Albans. My practice is there. You think I'm gonna leave him here in Calcutta? Dr. Schilling, without an immediate ablation, there's a remote but very real possibility of sudden cardiac death. Get the forms! Dr. Stanley, OR one. The doc is closing in. Finally. You know, if it was my child, I would be just as frustrated. Yeah, you're damn right you would. Mr. Deegan, are you experiencing blurred vision? I told you... Answer the question. Is your vision blurred? Maybe a little bit. Dad, what's wrong? Dad! Not just stress... Hypertensive crisis. 210 over 120. Sir, we need to get your pressure down right away. Are you allergic to any medication? Could you just stitch up my daughter? You know what? We will. We got to make sure you don't have a stroke first. Hmm. A quart. Are you criticizing my bladder? Ryan's leaving. Why are they doing that? Well, sometimes smart people do stupid things. I got to get this down to the lab and discharge Ryan. I need you to talk to your friend. About? About where he got his hands on enough meds to nearly kill himself. His parents can't get anything out of him. Why is this so important to you? Because I don't want any more of your friends in my hospital. That should be important to you. Sometimes I sort of feel like I'm... Like I'm on a treadmill... Just barely keeping up, you know what I mean? Yeah. I do. I've been doing it about a month. This week, I... I started taking more, just to get through midterms. Well, I think you bought yourself a couple extra days of study time with the whole heart-attack thing. Ryan... Where'd you get it from? Ryan, my mom is right. If this could happen to you, it could happen to any kid. Hello. Am I crazy, or are you deliberately not making eye contact with me? I'm sorry. I asked you to do one simple thing. Why was I saddled with watching your equipment in the first place? You were there. Oh, please. You know what that is? Classic male presumptive reliance on female submissiveness. Oh, sure, now I'm a sexist. You look sort of sexist. Hey, Bobbie, can I see you for a sec? Can you make sure the Schillings initial this and sign here and then escort them out? Not happening? Please, you had sex with that man. What are you, an intercourse psychic now? Tuesday and Wednesday. I can see it all over you. You sexed yourself right out of the warm and fuzzies into old bickering couple. Dr. Stanley, OR one. Dr. Stanley... No worries. I got it. I got it. You cover a lot of hospitals? Absolutely. All over the state. Tell you a little something for your readers, okay? A heterosexual male nurse... You're referring to yourself on this one? Yes. Yeah, a heterosexual male nurse, like myself, creates a palpable sensual energy in the ER. It's like... it's... my testosterone colliding with an avalanche of estrogen, and, frankly, it's hot. The blond nurse is hot. Candy. Yeah. Oh, she is. Do you think she'd like to take a walk with me? No. No, focus on the story. All right? Come on. What is this... The second wave? No, it's the fourth, Tom. And I can't do this, so if you're not gonna put your foot down, I am. Take it easy, okay? Maybe Morrissey and the city are working things out. I can't bank on "maybe." He'd be happy for an excuse to replace you. You know that, right? When did you two have sex? Ryan told me where he got it from, but he doesn't want anybody to know that he told. Okay. Can you keep that promise? I can try. Why should I trust you if you don't trust me? Hey, Marquea, hold up. I just, uh, put a call in to St. Albans. You are way out of line... Possibly in violation of doctor-patient privilege. Marquea, can you give us a second? Actually, I didn't speak to any doctors. I just talked to the pharmacy. What are you talking about? Ryan didn't get the drugs on his own. He has a prescription. Where would he get a prescription? Ask him. The hell with this! From me. All right? For the moment, let's just forget about this, and let's go. H... how could you do something like that? He needed help. He's in an extremely competive academic environment. He needs just a push! Stop it! To help him? Or is this emergency evacuation just to get him out of here so you can protect yourself? You know what, Karen? I can page Dr. Wakefield right now. He can have a cath lab prepped, ready to go. Don't risk your son's life. We've already decided. Shut up. Fine. All right. On. Off. On. Off. On. Off. What about supplies? You rushed a tox screen? Thanks. Okay, no worries. I'll be there soon. Bye. It's taking longer than I thought. Well, he's in good hands, so don't worry. Actually, you're entitled to worry your ass off, but he's gonna be fine. Have you reported my husband yet? I will have to. As you know, it's our duty to disclose. Michael's not a bad father. He's an idiot. But so am I for not seeing it. What he's done, it's... it's over. That is my son. And nobody... nobody... does that to him and gets away with it. Are you asking me to break the law? I'm asking you, parent to parent, to let me repair my family. And I promise you it will never happen again. I'd like to be alone. Well, it's a combat-free zone. I think they took all the signs down. You here to polygraph me? In a bit. They're varnishing my waterboard as we speak. What's this? That is the chemical breakdown of the largest urine sample in medical history. And? I haven't looked at it yet. Feel free. No, thanks. I already know what it says. Camille? We're all we got. You have got to stop lying to me. And then I'll get off your ass. You know, if you trusted me, I wouldn't have to lie to you. Well, if you hadn't started lying, then I wouldn't have had to stop trusting you. Thank you. Check on Ryan? Does it hurt? I actually don't feel anything. I told you. So, can a nurse draw your blood, or should we wait for a doctor? Knock yourself out. Got our kit back in the cab. Unit two guys accidentally walked out with it. Oh. Grab a beer later? Why would I go out for a beer with you? Why wouldn't you? Uh... Well, it's pretty obvious romance has died. I just wish I hadn't been quite so easy. Bobbie, I'm crazy about you. I just get a little intense with the job sometimes. Pick you up after shift? Cool. Well, look at that... Warm and fuzzy. Hey. Hey. How's Ryan? I just told the parents. He's okay. Well, physically, at least. Got to be a head case with parental pressure like that. What do you mean? Nothing. You lay int Morrissey yet? No, but I'm on my way. Oh. Mind if I join you? Come on. A shootout in the ER. Is the last thing we need. John, you've got to trust your people on the ground. Focus on the big picture, and leave the day-to-day floor management to Christina. And trust that when she says the ER is overloaded, it's overloaded... Period. Here's a news flash. While Ms. Hawthorne was babysitting her daughter and caught up in whatever personal drama... Wait a minute. No. That was not how... My turn. My "floor management" skills convinced the board's budget chairs... You saw them, two horrified men in expensive suits in the ER. with me... that we need more staff. You were putting on a show? In a sense. I saw the sacred heart overflow as an opportunity, and I took it. Why didn't you just tell me? I don't trust you. Great. Why didn't you tell me? You'd tell her. You're blinded by friendship, doctor. It's... it's a weakness of yours. Obviously not one of yours. This is gold. My editor's talking front page, above the fold. Nice. Just to put it out there... If you go on record, they will run your photo. You could be just like Julia Roberts in that lawsuit movie. Yeah. Let me sleep on it, okay? Everybody! Morrissey's office is all over me about a complete patient roster. I have every Sacred Heart patient accounted for except one psych patient... Alex Lewison, male caucasian, 6'4", 190 pounds, blue eyes, brown hair, schizophrenic, and delusional. Has anyone come across this guy? Over there. You're the one that thinks his male-nurse musk is an aphrodisiac, and I'm delusional? Way to go, deep throat. Please just... Come on! No, I don't want... Come on! How is he? Well... thank God. I owe you an apology. I... I crossed a boundary. There's no excuse for putting you in that position. No, there's not. Your husband needs to take a very long leave of absence. I understand. Do you? You are lucky that I just lost my husband and I understand what it means for a child to live without their father. Thank you. I don't get it. Why would the pharmacy give you Dr. Schilling's personal prescriptions? I didn't actually call the pharmacy. I just said I did. You are such a liar. Oh, no, no, no, no. I don't lie. That's what you call a bluff. Well, thanks for not ratting out Ryan. Well, daddy's the one who messed up. I didn't see any reason not to give boyfriend a free pass. He's not my... Maybe he is. All those googly-eyes you two were throwing at each other, you made it pretty obvious. You know, I always think about losing my dad, but I never really thought about the fact that you kind of lost your boyfriend, too. I guess I did. Come on. Come on with me while we make a pit stop. He's in good hands, Isabel. I can see that. But first, a few things first, okay? See the way that I'm rocking him from side to side? Mm-hmm. That's the way he likes it. If you do the up-and-down thing, you're just gonna get a bunch of tears and probably a face full of spit-up. And don't worry about a pacifier. He doesn't like pacifiers.
