 Yeah. Oh, God! - Here to finish the job? - I'm sorry. It's all right. How's Woodbridge? Sedated, but he got off way easier than you. And me. - Yeah, I... - I did that? - Yes. You've got a hard head. - Thank you. - Very hard head. But you let him have it. - Yeah, you know, I didn't want to hurt him. - Of course. - He's worried about Candy finding out. - Thank you. - Candy? Why are you worried about Candy? Gee, I don't know, Christina. Do chicks like it when you get publicly humiliated? Stitches are sexy. Black eyes, totally hot. - Absolutely. - Really? If you really believed that, you wouldn't be doing it with pretty-boy paramedic, would you? Nick and I are not doing it. We went out on one date. Which is one more than you've had in a year and a half. - You keeping score? - I'm just saying. I'm a widow with a juvenile delinquent at home. What's your excuse? - I've only got one leg. - Nick knows, doesn't care. How about he's prettier than you, so it makes you uncomfortable? We got an incoming! - What do we have? - Trauma bed? John Doe walk-in. Hyperventilating and disoriented. - Yeah, I'll be waiting right here. ...tube, an Ambu bag, and let's alert respiratory therapy. Let's get him over here. Excuse me, sir. What's your name? - Fred. - Fred. Okay, okay. - Fred, what's your last name? - Fred. Let's frisk him for ID. - No pockets. - Okay, check his socks. - Fred, have you taken any drugs? - I'm Fred. I'm Fred. Okay, it looks like a brain event, maybe even a stroke. - Let's get a tox screen. Hold that red top. - Got it. Fred Bernard. All right. Okay. Fred Bernard. Thank you. All right, I'll notify the family. - Morning, Christina. - If you're down here, it must be bad news. No, the ORs are packed and I need to prioritize cases. - Anything I should know about? - Patient in trauma two, Fred Bernard. - Probably neuro. - Need a brain scan? - You're the doctor. - I'll take a look. You want some ice for that? It actually doesn't hurt at all. I just didn't want Ray feeling worse. Oh, my God. Ray. Mrs Lachman? The "too mean to die" Mrs Lachman? Yeah, I'm afraid so. Any chance she was up all night? Maybe I'll catch a break. - She likes to be up with the roosters. - You're so lucky you work graveyard. I'll just fluff up those pillows for her. Help! Help! Help! No! Mrs Lachman! Mrs Lachman, it's okay. It's okay. She's trying to snuff me! No, no, no. This is your nurse today. Her name is Kelly. I'm so sorry that I scared you. I was just trying to make you more comfortable. - I don't want her. I want somebody else. - Yeah, well, you know we can't do that. Kelly is the nurse that is assigned to you today. You will be in good hands. I need you to take your meds. Those aren't my pills. Mine are supposed to be purple. No, no, no. These are your Macrodantin, the exact same prescription you had yesterday. You trying to poison me, blondie? Okay, that wasn't necessary. Now Kelly's gonna have to get you new pills. Think I'm gonna let her murder me? I want my doctor! Okay, I'll page Dr Mazaki for you right away. It's okay, Candy. I'll get it. Go home. Thank you. Okay. Mrs Lachman, I'm gonna see you tonight. Good night, Barbie. Give my best to Ken. Are you paging my doctor from the linoleum? I'm sorry. I'm on my way. Where are my pills? They're late! Hey, Camille. I tried to catch up with you at Dr Trevor's office. He said you had a breakthrough today. - Really? - Yeah. You want to tell me about it? - Morning, Chief. - Hey. Requisition form, finally. - Thanks, Rochelle. - Mom. - What? - She totally saw you reading her nametag. I don't have to read anybody's nametag. I know every name of every nurse here at Richmond Trinity. No way. You are so full of it. Excuse me. I'm not the one with the lying problem, remember? It's not a problem. Camille, I'm sorry I missed the therapy session, okay? I had a real emergency. The patient was acting erratic, just crazy. - If I... - Camille! Okay, go. We can talk about it later. - Nope. - What do you mean, "No"? Hey. Camille. Seriously. I love you. "I love you, too, Mom." - Hey, hey. What's the problem? - No problem, except I can't get SportsCenter. She won't sign her discharge papers. What kind of hospital don't have cable? All the good shows are on cable. Isabel, come on. We went through this yesterday. - Come on, put your new clothes on. - No. I tried. They don't feel right. It's like I'm wearing somebody else's skin. Of course they don't feel right if you don't give them a chance! Look, you've made a lot of progress in a very short amount of time. Yeah. I even stopped calling her "bitch." - That's true. - Nice. Christina, you should've saw my baby today. He smiled at me so big right through the incubator. Don't do this, Isabel. Okay? Moses going home with you is an impossibility. He's still very sick, and he needs us to take care of him. Okay? Yeah, I get that. But I'll be damned if I'm taking one step out of here - without the other thing I love the most. - Okay, and what would that be? My Celtic Green Chuck Taylors. - I think we gave those to Goodwill. - I am Goodwill. - Find them. - Yeah. You better. 'Cause I'm not budging till I'm lacing them up. All right, you want to give me a hand over here? I said I don't want the enchiladas! They give me gas! What happened? He was doing fine until he decided it was Mexican fiesta night. Okay. Mr Bernard, we reached your wife, Lindsay. - She's on her way, okay? - Lindsay! Lindsay, there's a problem. No, no, no. I said, Lindsay's on her way. When she gets here, I will bring her right to you. I walked the elephant, but she wouldn't poop. Well, there's always a next time. No! No, no! Lindsay! Don't let them do it to me! Tell them to stop! Okay, everybody, hold up. Hold up. Okay? Just back off and he'll calm down. - He's really strong. - I wouldn't hurt my wife! Lindsay, there's something I have to tell you. I got it. I got it. - Lindsay. - I'm right here. - I'm sorry I didn't do my math homework. - It's okay. You don't have to do your math homework if you don't want to. You're my wife. You're supposed to say that. Hey, Carl. Imaging ready? - Yeah. - Okay, good. So, listen, Fred? Carl is gonna take you to get a CAT scan, okay? I scared the cat yesterday. Lindsay, you know how much I love you, don't you? I do. I'll explain later. What happens in Richmond Trinity stays in Richmond Trinity. - No, no, no! No, no. Don't leave me. - Okay, wait a minute. - Hold it. Hold it. Listen, Carl is just gonna... - No, no, no. Lindsay, I need you by my side. I gotta tell you something. You're the one who married him. Lindsay, you still there? Yes, I'm here. You okay? The stars are so bright. Yes, they are. You see that? A cerebral aneurysm, right frontal lobe. - Neurosurgery ready for this guy? - Well, I'll give them a heads-up, but his pressure is still a little low to send him to the OR. I love you. I love you, too. Is there a real wife? Yes. She works in Lexington, so she'll get here as soon as she can. Does she know about you? If you want, I can ask Dr Mazaki for a consult with a vascular specialist. They've made great strides in treating varicose... - What are you trying to do, cripple me? - I was just... - Dr Mazaki! ...trying to improve your circulation. - Thank God you're here. - What wrong, Mrs Lachman? This nurse is prescribing treatment. She thinks she's some kind of doctor or something. - No, I... - And she was late with my pills! Get her out of here. - Yeah. - Excuse me? - I would like to be alone with patient. - What are you, deaf? He wants you to respect doctor-patient confidentiality. Take a hike, rookie. - Hey. - Hey. - Fred Bernard's film in? - I just got him his CAT scan. - And? - Lffy. I'll go give it a read. For the record, you hurt my feelings. - Off the record, what the hell did I do now? - You didn't invite me to the wedding. - There was no wedding. - Congratulations, Christina. I'm great at weddings. You know, I drink, I dance like a white guy, I hit on the bridesmaids and I give a great toast. Yeah, and then you throw up in the azaleas. Yeah, probably, but I'm still gonna get you a gift. Want to know why? - Why? - 'Cause I'm a giver. I was thinking maybe a nice soup tureen or something. That'd be great. Fred loves soup. - Listen, Christina, I'm not a psychiatrist. - Then save me the analysis. Okay, but this all seems like pretty borderline behaviour. Stick to surgery, and excuse me while I cross that border and go see my friend Fred. Well, according to your timecard, there is no overtime. No, it's Stein. It's Stein, not Stern. Delete the "R," put in an "I." Here you are, Roy. Ray. Sixteen hours of overtime. Really? Really. It's all right there, and it is signed by my supervisor. - You nurses are all in it together. - In what? You don't do your paperwork during the shift like you're supposed to. You do it after, while drinking latte and charging the hospital time-and-a-half. It's a scam. Oh, no. No, no. No, it's not. Actually, I worked those hours. Whatever. You ever consider getting rubber clothes? Save you a bundle on dry-cleaning, and then you could just hose yourself down - at the end of the day. - Who can afford dry-cleaning? We don't get overtime. We're polyester people. Fill this out and bring it back. - Well, can't I just fill it out now? - No. - Why? - Because you're on the clock. You're supposed to be working, nursing patients or whatever. - I'm on break. - Breaks are 15 minutes, no more, no less. You've got 90 seconds to get back to your ward. Yeah? I can make it back in 30. Knock yourself out. - You still here? - Made a commitment. You see his films? I did. I recommended a craniotomy. Is he ready? His pressure's 80 over 60. That's a little low. No one wants this guy dying in the OR. No one wants him dying in the ICU, either. Better here than there. I mean, he dies here, at least he came in that way. He dies there, it's something we did. Well, how about we don't let him die either place? Okay. Then get his pressure up. Okay, fine. If it comes up 10 points systolic, he goes to surgery. Twenty-five systolic, 15 diastolic. Fifteen systolic, 5 diastolic. - Twenty-10. - Deal. Everything in order? Okay. Hi. - I'm trying to work here, Nick. - Don't let me stop you. - Is there something I can help you with? - Is that a trick question? Can you just get out of here, please? My partner's in the bathroom. I can't leave without him. - Wait in the truck. - It's cold and Ionely out there. - I'll see you tonight. - Can't wait. Okay, at first, it was kind of sexy. Now it's just annoying. Tell Wally I'm outside. - Hello! MVA on l-95. Multiple injuries. - ETA? - Three minutes. - Thanks, Susie. - Hey, Bobbie. Looking for Nick? - No. No, I was just getting some fresh air. It's okay. Guys love it when girls fall all over them. We relieved some of the pressure. He's much more cogent. He's still not stable enough for such an invasive surgery. Endovascular coiling is less invasive. - It's preferable. - And won't get the entire mass. You go in once, get the entire aneurysm. He needs a craniotomy. This is a neurosurgery patient, Dr Wakefield, my patient. And I'm chief of surgery, Dave, which makes every patient my patient. Is that clear? Come on, guys, please, can you take this debate outside? Mr Bernard. Mr Bernard, you're gonna have to choose between two procedures, okay? Do you understand the choices we're giving you? No. It's too much. You have to decide. Mr Bernard, we're doctors. She's not. She isn't capable of rendering an opinion on... I want her input! Or I'm not having the surgery, period. We are running out of time. I have to agree with Dr Drayton. I think the endovascular coiling is a much safer choice. All right. You heard her. Yeah. "Endovasta" something. Let's get him prepped for surgery. You got a minute? - Don't you ever do that again. - What? Have a different opinion than you? - You were way out of bounds, Christina. - Drayton seemed fine with it. - Maybe it's 'cause you sided with him. - Or maybe because I'm right. - You're not his wife. - I know that. Do you? And now you're the one that's out of bounds. - Why so glum, chum? - Nothing I can't handle. Come on. You can tell me. - I'm having patient problems. - Lucky for you, I'm a problem solver. That's why I'm the charge nurse. - It's Mrs Lachman. Every time I even... - I'll page Christina. I said I want my wife to shave me. You know what? You're actually in very good hands with Angela. She used to work at Supercuts. I'll see you later, Fred. No! Don't go. I need you. Okay. - Lindsay, I'm scared. - It's okay to be scared. Not of the surgery. Of being bald. - I haven't seen you laugh in so long. - You haven't? - What if I die? - You're not gonna die. Yeah, but what if I do? You'll be all alone. - Lindsay, I have to tell you something. - Okay. I had an affair, and I have to live so I can make it up to you. I love you. Lindsay, please, when I get out of here, promise me that you'll give me a second chance. - Fred... - And if something happens to me, promise me you'll find someone and you'll have that family you always wanted. You always wanted kids. Promise me. I promise. - And if I don't make it... - Listen, you're going to live. Christina, the man has an aneurysm. You have to take everything he says with a grain of salt. Maybe he made up the affair. So are you saying I should tell her or not? She knows about the constipated elephant. How much worse could this be? You know, before Michael died, he said to me, "I have something to tell you." And he never did. My question is, would I have wanted to know that he was having an affair? I think the wife should know everything. It's up to her to decide what's real and what isn't. - Okay, well, what good comes out of that? - I don't know. What if I don't tell her? Will she ever know? You know you don't have to get in the middle of everything, right? - Now, scram! - But we got a new bullfighting act. He plays the bullfighter, I play the front of the bull. - He plays... He's in the bull, too. - Go on. You're full of bull. Beat it, you hams. - Listen, you! - What? Listen, you might hear something. Mr O'Brien... They sent in the big guns, huh? What brings you here, Chief Hawthorne? I hear you've been abusing my nurses again. What are you talking about? I haven't seen a real nurse all day. - Can I be frank? - You can be anyone you want. Nurses are not servants. They are professionals that should be treated with respect. You're one to talk. I heard you sucker-punched a nurse today. That was for the good of a patient. Well, what are you gonna do for this patient? Strangle little Nurse what's-her-name? I'm gonna have Kelly come back in here and do her job. Now listen, we're all on the same page. We want to see you feeling better so that you can leave Richmond Trinity as soon as possible. What? In a body bag? - Chief Nursing Officer, huh? - Yes, I am. I guess there's no height requirement for that job. - Straighten it out? - There's no winning with her. - It's okay. I can handle it. - Cheryl, can you... Cheryl? Difficult patients are part of the job. We are here to take care of the sick, no matter what. So I need for you to check your emotions at the door, get your ass in there and do what you know. Got it? - Got it. - Go get her. - Okay. - All right. Cheryl, you can come out now. Hey. I'm not gonna be able to make it tonight. Sorry. - You okay? - Yeah. Fine. It's okay. No problems. Another time. Bobbie, you sure you're all right? I'm fine. All right, on my count. One, two, three. - Hey, Marian. - Hey. It's time for Moses to eat. Is that his bottle? Yes, ma'am. You want me to feed him today? - No, no, I got it. - All right. You should give that nurse a raise. Look what we have here. Hey, little man. How you doing? All right. Here we go. - There you go. - Yes. How are you? Yes. Mama's got a busy day today. Wish me luck. I'm going out into the world. Moving into a shelter. Auntie Christina set it up. It's not forever. I'll be back. But while I'm gone, don't you give these nurses a hard time, okay? They love you almost as much as me. You're my boy. - So, you've got your voucher for the shelter? - In my pocket. All right, good. Now, what are you supposed to do with your meds? When do you take your meds? Every morning, Christina, with my Frosted Flakes, and I'll see the stuck-up social worker every Wednesday - whether I like it or not. - That's right. - I got it, Christina. Relax. - All right, all right. You know, it's just what I do. I can't help myself. This is my bus. - All right. Chop-chop! - Please, take care of my boy. You know we will. You just make sure you're doing what you're supposed to be doing. - Oh, no! No, no! - Easy, girl. Wrong bus. We're losing him. Charging to 300. Clear! Charge again. Clear! - What the hell happened? - He crashed on the way to the OR. V-tach. Yeah, that's it. I'm calling it. - Time of death is 4:12. - No way! No way! - Have you lost your mind? - Move, move! Charge to 300! Clear! Charge to 300! Nurse Hawthorne, the man's dead. - Christina. - Charge to 360. Clear! Charge 360. Clear! - He's gone, Christina. - Again! - Christina. - You can't die on me. Come on. Come on! Christina, he's gone. He's back! Pulse 130, systolic 60 and climbing. Load him with amiodarone. Get a full ISO work-up. Someone page neuro. This guy's aneurysm is an active bleed. We got to get him to the OR, stat. That woman's off the rails. Keep her away from my patients. You ready to call time of death now, Doctor? - You call this dessert? - Yes, I do. Well, I don't. Well, according to the menu, filled out in your handwriting, you ordered it. I ordered cherry, not lime. Who in their right mind would order this green crap? Bring me cherry. No. Excuse me? There is no excuse for you, Mrs Lachman, or your behaviour. I will not be bullied. I want pudding. No. Bring me chocolate pudding! You can stop screaming. It's not gonna do you any good. It'll get you fired. Dr Mazaki! She's trying to kill me! - Dr Mazaki! - Fine! Why don't you do everyone a favour and just drop dead? Code blue! Code blue! - Mrs Bernard? - Hi. I'm Christina Hawthorne, Chief Nursing Officer. - Did I make it in time? - Fred is in surgery. He has a cerebral aneurysm, which is a weakened blood vessel in the brain. It did burst, and we did have some complications. Is he gonna live? I can promise you, we're gonna do everything that we can for him. - So you were the one taking care of him? - I was. The whole drive here, I just kept thinking that the last time we spoke, we argued. I don't remember what it was about, but I know that I started it. - It happens in marriages. - And then I got pulled over for speeding. I told the cop the truth, I was on my way to the hospital. My husband had collapsed. And he just laughed and said, "Can't you do better than that, lady?" Writes me a ticket. There goes my insurance. Please don't let him die. I have eight minutes, okay? - This is the wrong form. - No, it is the one that you gave me. No, it isn't. I wouldn't give you the XR-190 when you need a 67-Z. - Okay, I'm not filling out another form. - Then you won't get your money. - Who's your supervisor, Larry? - Lorraine. - But she's busy. - Yeah. Let's take another look. Okay. Wait. You're a patient? - What? What are you talking about? - Says here you're a patient. My boss punched me, okay? And yes, I had to be treated in the ER, okay? So you're here to file a workers' comp claim. - No, no, no, Larry. No. - You need the WC-15 - for that. - Larry, I want my overtime pay, okay? I wish I could help you. - Lorraine? Lorraine? - You'll get it in the next pay cycle. No, I need it now, okay? That's in two weeks. Well, you could fill out an R-80, but unfortunately, you won't have time. Should have filled out the proper forms in the first place. I told her I wanted her to die. And then she died! - It's not like you murdered her, Kelly. - Murdered her? - That never even crossed my mind. - No, no... Oh, my God! Come here. Come here. - Christina! - She's all yours. - Kelly. Kelly. - I'm not cut out for this. I'm not. Listen, loss hurts. That will never change. And if it did, we wouldn't be human, now, would we? No. - It's gonna be okay. - Oh, no. Be strong. Be strong. Dr Mazaki, I am so, so, so sorry. I just... I was... Thank you. That makes me feel so much better. The surgeon said the procedure went really well. - "Procedure," cold word. - Well, Fred's not stable yet, so... Fred's no quitter. I just want him to open his eyes, smile that smile and say my name. Listen, I may be way out of line with this, but... When you were with Fred today, did he talk about me? Or did he ask about someone named Connie? - Just you. - Really? Yes. He loves you very much. And from what I can tell, he doesn't want to do anything without having you by his side. - Well, I'd better get back in there, then. - Yep. - Thank you. - You are welcome. - Here's that chart, Dr Wakefield. - Thanks. Am I fired? You saved the guy's life, so you're getting a pass, this time. Great. Reminded me of old times. They got a happier ending. You know, they want to have kids. That's nice. That's nice. Everybody deserves a second chance. And another sedative for Mr Woodbridge. Poor guy. I mean, he's suffered so much today. The way you single-handedly wrestled him to the ground and then overpowered him. - I mean, he must be traumatized. - Yeah, you know... - Who told you? - Who didn't? Yep. Well, at least you're laughing. You know, I bet if I got in a car wreck, you'd wet your pants or something. Ray. I'm serious. You want to know what my day was like today? - He almost strangled me. - Yeah, well, he's very ill. - I got punched out by my boss. - Well, Christina has a temper. - This jerk in payroll gave me the run-around. - You should've gone to Larry! He's the best! I did go to Larry, and I got jammed. And jellied. Yeah. And then I wasn't even man enough to get my money. And now you're laughing at me, and that was my day. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I can't help it. See how much fun you'd have if you'd go out with me? - I don't know. You're kind of accident-prone. - Well, at least I work in a hospital, right? - Oh, God. This place is out to get me. - Okay. - I don't want to talk about it. - Fine. Then just listen. - I'm waiting. - Exactly. - What's wrong with you? - You're waiting. For what? The perfect guy? The perfect moment? Not gonna happen. - Okay. Okay, I'll take it under advisement. - Like hell you will. You're gonna get up off your ass and you're gonna go on that date. Chrissie, I can't. I just... I want it too badly. And I... I have to wait until I'm not so desperate. Bobbie, you are beautiful. You are smart. He is lucky you're interested. - Hey, Hawthorne? - Yeah? I don't like you talking trash about my boyfriend. All right, well, I already punched one nurse out today. From the mean streets of D.C. What, what? Hey, Christina. What are you doing here? I thought we had an agreement. - I had to tell Moses about my day. - Visiting hours are over. - Well, could you sneak me up there? - No, I can't. I kept my word. I did everything you said. You know, some of the other women at the shelter, they have their kids with them. Is that where they keep Moses, that room up there? It's actually that one. It's okay if I stay until they turn down the lights? When's your curfew? I have an hour before I have to be back to the shelter. Don't be late. - Christina? - Yeah? I like being a mom. Me, too. Twinkle, twinkle, little star How I wonder what you are So, thanks for pretending to be interested in the inner workings of the defibrillator. Next time, I'll show you how to use it to make a mean grilled cheese sandwich. If anyone has any questions, you know how to find me. Hey. Class dismissed, you numbnuts. So, if you still want to get that dinner... Well, I don't know. The way you were acting back at the hospital... Fine. You and your buddies can slide up and down that fire pole all night. Well, first of all, it's physically impossible to slide up a pole. - Then have fun washing the Dalmatian. - That's such a tired firehouse clich?. Dinner's on me. I guess I gotta eat. Listen, you need to know, I don't expect anything from you - that you're not ready... - Hey, numbnuts, in case you didn't notice, I picked you up. - Hey. - Hey. Brought us some Chinese. Got some spring rolls, some moo shu with extra plum sauce. Cool. - How was school? - School. I guess it's gonna be a monosyllabic night? - Yeah. - Fine. - Food? - Later. Plate? - Tired? - Very. Rest. Thanks.
