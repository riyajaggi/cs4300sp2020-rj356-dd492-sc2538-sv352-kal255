 Insurance companies cap payments. The state won't help us to bridge the gap. Morrissey, we did everything they asked. They can't do this. They just did. Three months -- that's all we've got. We'll shut our E.R. Down in a month And begin layoffs immediately. You and the other surgeons will gain O.R. Rights at James River. We start transferring cases over there To help us empty out. James River is a pit. Right now it's the only hospital in this area left standing. State wants me over there.

 Maybe we can avoid making the same mistakes we made here. I need you to go with me. I need people I can trust. Wait. We did everything right here. It's pointless. If we went belly-up this fast, James River won't last a year. And if it goes under, There won't be a hospital in the area That'll care for anyone without a gold card. Well, congratulations.

I had it towed. You bastard. You just gonna stand there and look pretty? Come on, jump in. Thought you'd never ask. Good work, Tom. Thank you. Excuse me.

What seems to be the problem? You know, we've been here nearly four hours. She's in a lot of pain. Abdominal? Are you pregnant? No. Let's take your temperature. Change in financial news... Pulse and temperature are normal, So let's go back and take a look. All right, come on, gen. Here we go. Excuse me, miss. You know, I'm just with someone -- Someone will be with you -- this is important. Hey, hey, buddy. Why don't you wait your turn? Look. Sir, is this your penis? My dog told me to cut it off. What do you think I should do? I'd get a new dog. Someone will be right with you! Oh, come on. All right, baby. Come on and sit down. Hey, Dr. Shaw? I could use a hand in here. Of course. Hello, sir. What do we have? Uh...See for yourself. Oh. Is it, um... Is it yours? It's lost a little color. His dog told him to do this. Yes, always been a cat fellow myself. Okay. Examine the wound, See if reattachment is even possible, And I will call in a psych consult? Yeah. Please. Poor guy. Yeah. Dr. Reese to I.C.U. Dr. Reese to I.C.U. Hey, Marcus? Yeah. Could you admit the patient in number... 8? ...8. And also, could you -- And call in a psych consult. I already did. I got ice. Ice? 8. Thank you. That's awesome. That's remarkably efficient, but I just have to ask -- Uh, how did you know? Dog called it in. Uh, Gail? My man's had a psychotic break. Hallucinations, Self-inflicted genital amputation. So my wait time just got longer. There's a woman in the waiting room Complaining of abdominal pains. I saw. Fever? No. Pulse? 62. She's been waiting for hours. We'll get to her. Can we at least run a preg test? Get her in line for a ct scan? At the very least, get her some pain medication? Folks here like to lay it on thick So they can cut to the head of the line. She's faking? You'd be surprised at some of the stuff I've seen. Mrs. Carrollson? How long have you had that tumor? About 19 years. And why did you say you never had it looked at? It didn't hurt. Another faker? A warehouse fire Near Detroit, Michigan, this morning Is still only 60% contained. Local firefighters are... Welcome aboard. I didn't say anything. Why else would you be here? All right, what do you plan on doing With your existing director of nursing, Who happens to be storing corpses in your E.R.? I'll deal with that. You know, I can't afford your old salary. I'll deal with that. Then what are you standing around for? Here's your office. In here? No. No. Here. This is a waiting room. Yeah. Uh, it's the only space we have available right now. I can't displace any of the James River staff. This is a waiting room. I'll make it work. Look, uh, this hospital is below the national average On everything -- from heart-attack care To giving out the right antibiotics. Across the board, our quality of care sucks. What about the joint commission national performance summary? 58%. John, we had over 90% at Richmond trinity. You mean to tell me that this place Is not providing minimum quality of care? The joint commission said They'll inspect us in six months. If we don't get 75%, they'll cut our funding. I'm on it. I'll... I'm on it. Thank you. I'll get your furniture from Richmond trinity. It'll feel like home in no time. Dr. Hart to recovery. Hey. Someone left him behind. Thanks, Kelly. It hurts! Please! Please! Stop! It hurts! Hey. You need any help? I-I can't get a vein, and I can't use the other arm. Okay. Um, why don't I get a hot pack To bring out the veins, and then I'll try? I need to change his dressing, too, Before the O.R. Oh, I can help with that. Knock yourself out. Why don't you get the hot pack and, uh... I'm outta here. I hate her. Oh, she's doing her best. I was new once. All right, let me see that arm. What happened? Burnt. How? I was cooking for my sisters And spilled a pot of water for the noodles on it. Mm. So, tell me about your sisters. They're all right. Just all right? Yeah. Hey. What? That kid was just scared. Thanks. Yeah, some kids just have crappy veins. It takes time. I mean, you should have seen me When I first started. I've been here two years. Yes, we're gonna X-ray first. The surgeons will do what they can. Good luck. What are you guys doing here? Responding to a 911 call. Get me a doctor! Sir, you can't call 911 If you're already in the hospital. Well, take us somewhere else, then. I can't do that. She's in pain. They won't see her. She's been triaged. We've had higher-priority cases come through. I understand how frustrating this is. I can take her. See? There you go. Sorry about this, fellas. Excuse me. We have a toddler that ingested cleaning fluid. She's having retractions. Isn't there anyone else? No. Well, I think this woman has -- I didn't ask you what you thought. I know you were r.N. Charge nurse at trinity, But let me explain how this works here. A doctor or senior nurse gives an order. You follow it. Take care of the toddler first. Yes. Can someone tell me why Mr. Greener Is still snuggled in bed? I ordered an X-ray hours ago. Mr. Greener? Yeah. Dr. Marshall! Greener is scheduler for an echo later this afternoon, And he hasn't really been sleeping, So, you know, I thought I'd just let him rest. He can get the X-ray on his way back from echo. How considerate of you... Nurse Stein. I'm all about patient comfort, But I'm also about patient care, And I would love that X-ray as soon as possible. That's not too inconvenient for you, is it? Is it? No. I wouldn't want to ruin your tea party. no, sir. Uh, ma'am. Excuse me. Doctor! Doctor, one more thing. You look so hot today. Watch it, Stein. Mm-hmm. Hey, Marcus? Yeah. These are for Tiber. The abdominal just got sick all over the waiting room. No one's seen her yet? No. This place is insane. You're still here? Yeah. I just signed on as director of nursing. Oh, thank God! Now, listen. First things first. How long has that abdominal been in there? She's been waiting for over five hours. What? Mm-hmm. What is wrong with you people? Is she a hostage? I'm so sorry. "sorry"? I want to see the President of the hospital. Whoever's in charge. I'll freakin' Sue this place! This is the boyfriend of our abdominal patient. Oh. You know what? We're gonna see her right now. It's about time. Wait, wait, wait. What -- what's going on here? This man's girlfriend has been waiting forever. She needs to be seen. And she will be. Now. Excuse me? Listen, obviously morrissey hasn't talked to you, And this is not really my place, But I just signed on as director of nursing. He can't do that. I'm director. See, these two, they don't even know who works here. Get me a doctor. Look, sir, I told you -- I'm done with you. Okay, let's just evaluate -- no. Get me a doctor! You have to calm down! Don't tell me to calm down, or I'll knock the crap -- Whoa, hey! Call security! Hey, hey, relax! Just get off of me! All right?! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Somebody call the police! All right. Look, I'm fine. I'm gonna get security. My girlfriend, please. Okay. I have to help this patient. This is still my E.R. Not anymore. Bobbie, please? Sir? You are crazy.

Is ready for you. How long will this take? Another graft? Maybe an hour. No. I mean, when can I go home? Well, it depends how the graft takes, But at least a few more days. Don't worry. You are gonna be back at home in no time, Playing with your sisters, seeing your mom. She works all the time. What do you do for fun? You play sports? Not anymore. I'm a lefty. Oh, well, I have seen a lot of patients Learn how to use their right, so they're almost ambidextrous. I can't even eat without spilling my food everywhere. William, you're gonna be fine, okay? I promise. Let's get this over with. I need a terminal. Well, let me try that again. I need a terminal. Oh, I'm sure your word find can wait, huh? Yeah. I don't care if her patient is turning purple.

Can't wait to get rid of her. Kelly. Oh, thank you. Mm-hmm. Is that, uh, William's oxacillin? No, it's for the boy in 724. Why, did you give him oxacillin? is there a problem?

You said it was good -- more money, less hours, No more banging your head against the wall? Well, even you said it probably wouldn't last. I mean, look at this place, Camille. What could I do?

Camille? Not too late, okay? Oh, no, I'm staying at, uh, Suzanne's tonight. No. Camille! See that? Npo. Do you know what that means? It's Latin -- for "nil per Os" -- "nothing by mouth." It could also stand for "non per Os," But it means the same thing -- "nothing by mouth." That means Mr. Hanson should not be eating a BLT, Which stands for "bacon, lettuce, tomato." Pull your act together. Doctor. How did I ever let you convince me That this would be a good move? You're very suggestible post-coital. I really think you should try to lighten up on them, okay?

Did you write this up? Not yet. I want it in 15 minutes. And, you, uh, nurse... Kelly. Epson. Nurse epson, This isn't Richmond trinity. Here we follow protocols. We don't just run into the O.R. And stop a surgery. I'm writing you both up. Yes, ma'am. Way to get my back. Excuse me? Well... You really threw me under the bus. It was your error. Don't play that "sweet, innocent baby girl" thing with me. You could have covered for me. I helped your patient. And if that pisses off the higher-ups or you, Whatever. And, Malia? I do have your back. So if you need help, just ask me. Gustavo? We're gonna need you to step out for a bit While we take some x-rays. Oh. Uh, gladly. It's the abdominal, right? Yeah. Okay, let's go, then. All right. That's the position. This man. Sir, we need you to step outside with us. For what? Attacking and threatening hospital personnel. I-I didn't attack any-- You threw one of my clerks up against the wall, And you threatened me with physical violence. He was agitated. My girlfriend -- she'd been waiting for hours. Come with us, sir. This is crap. Put your hands behind your back. sorry, gen. This is not gonna fly. This is still my E.R. I don't care what anybody says. This is your office? Yeah. tell me it's true. Are you here? You didn't think I would leave you here by yourself, did you? Okay, good. Then you can save us from the nine circles of hell. These folks certainly are lost souls. Well, can you blame 'em? I mean, I can't help but think That they closed the wrong hospital down. Christina! Oh, I'm so happy! How -- how do I get in there? How crazy is your floor? Oh, the patients are great. I love it here! So, Gail's on the warpath. Mm-hmm? She just had Genevieve's boyfriend arrested for assault. She can't do that. Gail? The mean one? Yeah. Are you her boss? Yes, I'm supposed to be, But obviously, she's not getting that. Yeah, she came to ped's really upset with me For finding a medication error and pushing an O.R. Call, And... She's writing me up. She's what? This is crazy. What about you? Any run-ins? No, I got my hands full with Marshall. I bet. What, you just waltz in here and take over? Am I fired? Listen, morrissey is gonna talk to you, okay? All I know is that you getting that guy arrested Didn't help anything. He threatened me. Now, come on. I know you could handle him. Is this a joke? No. It's not. And he actually has a point. Five hours? You see how backlogged we are. Try "backwater." This place doesn't have any systems. It's like being out of 1972. I don't have to listen to you! I've been working here for 17 years. Doc, pressure's dropped to 89 over 50. Genevieve? Genevieve, can you hear me? She's unresponsive. Page respiratory. Marcus? Yeah. Respiratory. You got it. Draw a gas? Respiratory to E.R. She's not oxygenating. Get me 20 of etomidate and 120 of succinycholine. She must have a perforated bowel. The X-ray came out clear. Well, it must have just burst. Y-you need the combination. Why is the cart locked?! Just stay out of this. Who locks a crash cart?! We've had one taken. Get the other cart! Quick as you can. Come on, come on, come on. Pressure's dropped, 70 over 40. I'm gonna intubate. Give me a 7 1/2 e.T. Tube. She's desaturating. She needs more fluids. Prime the rapid infuser. This was taken by the boyfriend's cellphone. It's all over the Internet. It'll be on the news by tomorrow morning. I need full reports right away. We need to be able to explain how this could happen. It was a systemic breakdown. Yes, the whole hospital is broken. That's why we're here. I know, but it's gonna take a while To get this E.R. Up to the 21st century. I don't even know where to begin. That's not your problem. Yes, it is. What is this? I'm splitting the nursing department. Gail will handle critical care, E.R., and I.C.U.S. You'll take everything else. That is not what we agreed to! Joint commission is pulling up their inspection date To three months from now. You two need to work this out, Or we will lose our funding. Look what happened today. What's next? So you mean to tell me you can kill somebody else And end up on the Board of Directors? I'm the fall guy? Yes. My nurses -- your nurses. Your hospital closed. My nurses were right. You're more concerned about not being shown up Than these patients. That woman died today unnecessarily. You know how many of you folks I've seen parade through here? Dozens. You come in with big plans, big goals, But no idea how this hospital really works, No idea what we deal with. And then you know what always happens? You move on -- to bigger outfits, Following doctors to better jobs, While me and my people are left behind doing the best we can! That's why things don't change! That's why I wouldn't do one thing differently! You know what? Before you go on telling me how I can't handle the truth, Let's get one thing straight. I don't care what backroom deal you made! What happened in that E.R. Today will never happen again! And you set me up! I'm in an impossible situation. Oh, really, morrissey? Did she threaten you with a lawsuit? She's been here almost 20 years. She knows where the bodies are buried! That's because she buried them! You know what? This woman must have a sex tape of morrissey or something. No, I'm serious. Because she's not going anywhere. How are we gonna work with her? No, I think the question is, How are we gonna work around her? Good luck. Wait a minute. Bobbie, you're gonna be my eyes and ears. No way. She'll make my life a living hell. Bobbie, that woman died. Don't put me in that position. You tell me what choice I have. Candy. Can you hear me? Ray! It's good to see you. How's the new hospital? Oh, it's weird. It's so weird. It's... It's different. You know? How, uh... Where are you now? Um...All I can say is it's a f.O.B. "forward operating base." That sounds dangerous. Yeah, we've seen some action. You know, this is really where I should be. Good for you. Yeah. You're...Being careful, huh? Yeah. I'm not the one you should be worried about. What these people go through is amazing. Have you given any thought to, uh, what you're gonna do When your six months are up? You know, there's been so much going on here, I just really haven't decided yet. Really? Well, I'm sure they really need you, huh? Yeah. I'm just glad to be a part of it. It's a real honor. I miss you. I m-- Mm. How nice, waiting for me in my office. Made us a reservation -- At the hard Shell. Oh. You're so sweet. Mm-hmm. Mmm. You know what? I was thinking... About your advice. Mm-hmm. You know, to not be the dragon lady? You're good for me, steinie. Yes, I am. Vamos. See you tomorrow. William? Are you okay? I want this over with. Hey. Get up. Come on. Get out of bed. You're coming with me. Watch out. What are we doing here? You want to work on your right arm, don't you? Grab a paddle. You ready? You ain't playin'. I ain't playin'. Okay, then. Let's see what you got. All right. One love. There you go. Dr. Ginetti, 6211. Dr. Ginetti, dial 6211. Psst. How's our shooting victim? He's stable. Did you wait this whole time just for me? you wish. I work here. Well, what about your new job? They'll get over it. So we're staying? "we"? What about Sloan-Kettering? I passed. I couldn't leave Richmond. Besides, if you're gonna go up the River, You're gonna need some help. Oh, is that a fact? Mm-hmm. You know, actually, I, uh, I had a pretty good day today. I, uh, I assisted on reattaching a penis. Hmm. I'm surprised this place didn't lose it. Yeah. I'm surprised you didn't run for the hills the minute we got here. Couldn't. Although morrissey's up to his old tricks. So I guess we were both dealing with dicks today. So, straighten it out. Uh, the place, I mean, not the, you know. Come on, it couldn't have been that bad. Nah. It was. Oh, so tell me about it over dinner. Good. I need a ride home. Good. You did get the car cleaned. Uh, was I supposed to? The guy was bleeding all over the place. In the backseat! of course I got the car cleaned. Good. So, what did the car wash say... ...When they saw all that stuff? They must have thought you were an ax murderer. Well, I couldn't let some poor Joe clean up that whole mess. Oh, so you did it? Yeah. Of course I did it. Although, you know, technically, that's a nurse's -- Don't you dare. that's funny. Yeah. Wow. What do you think? Place looks great. You like? Yes. It's way different, huh? Very nice. Very nice. Want me to hang this up? You know what? That'd be nice. As long as it's above 4 feet. Forget it. Where's Camille tonight? She's actually at her girlfriend's house. She's gonna stay the night there. It's just us? Yeah. I'm sorry. I feel so stupid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, I... No, Christina, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have... Tom, it's not you. I just... That's -- that's okay. I... Listen. So stupid. You know what? I really want you to stay. I just... It's okay. It's okay.
