 Hawthorne (2009â€“2011): Season 1, Episode 5 - The Sense of Belonging - full transcript 
 Christina clashes with hotshot and arrogant new surgeon Dr. Phillips over his handling of her long-time young patient Amy Johnson who has been diagnosed with AVM. Although the surgery goes well Morrissey is far from amused with her actions. Meanwhile, Amanda checks in for biopsy surgery with Tom who hires Ray to be her nurse and for the procedure to be kept from Christina. Elsewhere, Larry from Accounting overpays Candy so she suggests drinks - Larry is delighted until Ray confronts him. Who will win?

 Now, before you go off and save lives... Mm... The good, old nasty, evil log sheets. Listen, guys, I feel your pain, but corporate keeps sending me the nastiest memos on this issue. What are they mad about? Well, Kelly, believe it or not, there are nurses who actually don't log their daily activities. There are even some that won't turn them in at all. And why can't administration just stop pissing away money on efficiency experts and just hire more nurses? Oh, that would actually make sense. So we are stuck with them.

 That's right. So here you go. Richmond Trinity, go! Oh, no. The day hasn't even started yet. No complaints. Amy Johnson was brought in to the ER last night. Cardiac arrhythmia? The ER docs couldn't figure it out, so they admitted her. This baby can't get a break. Who's Amy? Well, she's one of my, uh, first patients. She was born with a heart defect. She's been in and out of this hospital her whole life. Yeah, what is it, 12 surgeries now? At least. Listen, do me a favor. Just make their stay really comfortable. Create a nice homecoming. Show them some love.

 Attention, please! I'm looking for a Christina Hawthorne! Here I am. That crazy-ass homeless lady's looking for you... Isabel Walsh. She thinks she works here. What you want me to do? Do what I'm gonna do... congratulate her. Have a good one. I'm afraid I'll forget everything I learned in that orientation and make a big fool of myself. Are you kidding me? Look at this. These letter of recommendation... I got one from your social worker saying you're doing really well. And I got a big thumbs-up from your director at the shelter. Oh, he just sweating my swagger. As he should sweat your swagger. You know, I got my spies out there, too. My NICU nurses, they got my back. And so do I. Look what I got you. Bam! And this. I feel like I'm in the olympics. Well, you better get in there and go win that gold medal. Can I come to you, you know, if I screw things up? Well, see, this is the deal. You don't work for me. You work for the lab. See, I'm just a colleague. Col... colleague?! Yes! I ain't never had one of those. Well, now you got about 500 of them. HawthoRNe - Season 01 Episode 05 - "The Sense of Belonging". Hey. Oh, my goodness. Breasts! What happened? Yeah, I know. Finally, right? I'm happy to say they've made me quite popular. I'm sure they have. Did the attitude come with them? And I thought open-heart surgery was bad. Can you please tell her to cut me some slack? Does Camille talk to you like that? Oh, every day. I say we send them to juvie once Amy's released. Yeah, when will that be, six months from now? Ooh, no trash-talking in my hospital. All right. Let's see. Um, two days ago, I got dizzy on and off and then nauseous, and then I started vomiting... And vomiting. And vomiting. And last night, she fainted. Nearly did a face plant into a glass coffee table. Did ER rule out pericardial effusion? Water around the heart? They said her heart seemed normal. And what do you think, young lady? My heart's never been normal. How should I know? Don't be smart. I wasn't. How does your head feel? It's pounding. What about your arms and your legs? Are they weird? Um, I'm not real steady on my feet. What are you thinking? Well, whatever she's thinking, she's gonna tell me outside. Come on, Christina. Mom? Whatever it is, she can say it in front of me. I'm not a baby. You're my baby. So the ER went over all the usual stuff... arrhythmia, low blood pressure, infection. What do you think? Well, all her symptoms could be neurological. I could ask for a consult. But she's never had any issues with her brain. How can that be? I understand, but, Beth, you know the drill. Sometimes we have to figure out what it's not before we know what it is. Okay. Morning, boss! Morning, Isabel! How's it feel to be an official lab messenger? A lot like the stomach flu. You'll be fine. Just remember the guidelines. Oh, I got it. Be careful with the samples, double-check the labels... and stay on schedule. Okay, here I go. Hey. I think you're forgetting something. Oh, Isabel! The ice for the abg specimens. That's right. It's always good to get mistakes out of the way first thing. I'm glad that's over with. "7:43, picked up pen. "7:43, 40 seconds, used said pen to write this entry. "7:44... ... scratched my ass." No, this is gonna be the most detailed log Christina has ever seen. It's not a competition, Ray. "7:45, Candy abdicates victory to me." Oh, you know what? Were your paychecks normal this week? Sadly, yes. You get stiffed? No, overpaid. I think they think I'm still on graveyard, giving me a premium. Well... buy me something pretty. Yeah, I can't keep it. I got to go see Larry in accounting. Larry? Yeah. Jelly-doughnut-eating slob Larry? No. Sweet, shy Larry, whose wife just left him. Yeah. Well, word to the wise... take wipies. Ray. Or a garden hose. Stop it. Pressure washer. I'm not laughing. Yes, you are. You are. Nurse Stein. Not only is my patient a VIP, but very private, as well. I got it. A VP VIP. Wants to remain anonymous, off-grid. I specifically chose you for this job, but I have to know that you can be discreet. Lindsay Lohan was my patient once. Here, at Richmond Trinity? See? All right, so you cleared all my cases with Christina? Oh, well, actually, Christina doesn't know about this. And you can't tell her. But she's my boss. Yeah, well, meet the bigger boss Excuse me. Ray, where you going? No way. That is Christina's mother-in-law, okay? Find someone else. There is nobody else. Mrs. Hawthorne doesn't really get along with women. She needs a man. Oh. Really? That's why I was chosen? Cause I'm the only nurse on the floor with a "Y" chromosome? Thanks. What's the problem, Ray? What, are you afraid of Christina? Aren't you? Well, a little bit. Look, Mrs. Hawthorne is on the board of directors. She orchestrated this entire thing. Christina will never know. Are we talking about the same Christina? Mrs. Hawthorne. Hi. How are you? I'm Ray Stein, and I will be... I know who you are Oh, good. Wanna be doctor, gagged on your mcats twice. Do you really think I'd let you near me without a thorough background check? Oh. That makes sense. Shall we, uh, get you into your hospital gown? No. But we can get me into my Dior nightie. Mrs. Hawthorne, you are having surgery. So you have to wear a hospital issue. Actually, I don't have to do anything I don't want to do. True. Yeah. It's just, um, have you seen these, Mrs. Hawthorne? They're... they're really quite fashionable. I mean, they, uh, they... they... they tie at the neck and at the waist, and they have a lot of flair. And the best part? They open in the back for easy access. Well... when you put it that way... writing your memoirs? Christina asked us to be as detailed as possible. Mm, right. And that level of detail just isn't possible when you have a patient waiting. Well, I'm almost done. You are done. Hi again! I finished the medical history. Great. Um, we will check that in a sec. Let me first see this in grown toenail. How long has it been swollen, Mr. Tanaka? Three whole days. The infection might be in his bloodstream by now. Okay, it's important that he answers the question himself. He knows best what's happening in his own body. Do you think it might be staph? Because peopledie from staph infections, especially in hospitals. Try to stay positive. Death by toenail isn't very common. This is me and Jack at Buckroe Beach. Now, I know your parents didn't let you drive out there with that boyfriend of yours by yourself. No, no, they drove. Okay. And then they tortured us the whole way there and then wouldn't leave us alone for one second. You know, he... he's probably going to dump me because of them. Well, you know, your parents have always been overprotective, for good reason. But if you want to change that habit, you got to tell them. Stand up for yourself! Amy! Amy! What? What's going on? She's having a seizure. Somebody get some ativan in here! I'll get it! Amy. Can you hear me? Hold on, Amy. I got you, okay? Hold on. Hold on. Well, at this point, the entire hospital's in love with her. Hey. The neurosurgeon is across the hall. He's ready to go over Amy's brain scan. I wish we were. Do you mind if I stay with her until my break is over? We would love that. Thank you. Do you know Dr. Phillips? Is he good? I just met him, and, um, he's got a great reputation. The hospital worked really hard to land him. And now you'll get a chance to meet him. Come on. Okay. Is that the antibiotic? Uh, yes, it is. Cefazolin. Double-check the dosage. Is it exactly what the doctor said? Okay, triple-checking... Yes, it's correct. Okay, then. I will be back in a few to check on you, all right? It's called arteriovenous malformation. It's a very rare brain disorder. You see, it's a lesion of the cerebral vasculature. Amy needs corrective surgery as soon as possible. Dr. Phillips, is it possible that you might be able to explain avm in Layman's terms, just so that Beth and Dan understand exactly what they're dealing with? Well, it's difficult to grasp. Mind if I try? Uh, basically, Amy's arteries and veins should be separate, like my fingers. Instead, they are tangled in a clump. So now oxygen can't get to her brain. Is this because of her heart condition? No. It's another congenital defect completely unrelated. If we're gonna do this today, I need to get things in motion. All right? Wait a minute. Dr. Phillips, hold it. Surgery is a big deal. I mean, I would think that the family would need a minute to make a decision. We don't have a minute, and you know this. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson, I need to remove the malformation before any of the blood vessels go into active bleed. Now, shall we proceed? Yes. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. What do we tell Amy? You've spent your whole life fighting heart disease, and now your brain's trying to kill you, too? We don't know anything about brain surgery. We don't know that surgeon. How do we let him operate on our little girl? You're right. Let me do some research, get you guys up to speed on this. Let me talk to our chief of surgery, see how he feels about Dr. Phillips, okay? You do anything you have to do. Well, you're good. I hardly felt it going in. That's what she said last night. Uh, they're gonna want a urine sample, as well. Can I help you to the bathroom? Oh, sure. What the hell? Help the dying lady off her ass. Oh, please. A biopsy is not a death sentence. Come on. It was for my son. Can I ask you, um... Why do you want to go through this on your own? I... I'm not on my you know. I have you. You do. But I'm... but I'm not family. Exactly. All right, I get it. Trust me. I get it. It's just... Your daughter-in-law is really good at this whole caring-for-the-sick thing. Christina put in two grueling years with my boy. That's enough. And shouldn't she be the one to make that call? Give me the pee cup, would you? Please. Come on. I like you, Stein. I like you, too, Mrs. Hawthorne. I already saw it. I'm so sorry. I can't help myself! Kelly, you don't need to apologize. It's not your fault administration has no... Nurse! Where were you?! You're having an allergic reaction, Mr. Tanaka. Try to stay calm. I'll get the epi. It's okay. It's gonna be okay, okay? Okay, breathe deeply. Oh, my God. Okay. Oh! He'll need solu-medrol and respiratory. Get Dr. Cadbury. Okay. What happened?! Why wasn't she in here?! See, this can't possibly be correct. Right? Larry? We already deducted the taxes... You know, your... your fica, your pension contribution. You'd have to do a mountain of paperwork to cancel and reissue this. It's just best to let it go. Oh, until next pay period? I know how hard you nurses work... Always putting in extra time here and there. You know, work late, you're not charging overtime. It all evens out. Oh, I don't want to get you in trouble. If it'll make you feel better, you can use the extra cash to buy me a beer. A... a bunch of us can go out. That'd be really fun. Sure. I'm not good with crowds, you know, ever since my wife... You know. Tell you what... You come by second floor west, 7:30. Beers are on me. I don't want to be a bother. No, come on! You're not a bother, silly. You said 7:30? Why not? Yeah. Why not? See you then. Hey. You want to step in and give Moses his bottle? I won't tell. No, no way, Marian. I... I'm a working mom now. I got to set a good example for Moses. Don't you be tempting me. All right. So, because of her age and her levels right now, this is our best option. Oh, come in. We're still looking to bump someone from the OR to make a slot for Amy Johnson. Right. I was thinking maybe tomorrow. You know, it would give the family some time to evaluate this AVM diagnosis. Okay, it's got to be today. I'm in New York tomorrow. Conference? No, I'm doing another spot on the Today Show. I'm doing a piece on tethered spinal cords. Please tell me that we are no trushing Amy's surgery to accommodate your P.R. schedule. Amy could have another seizure and bleed out at any time. So the sooner the better for her, too. You know, I'm thinking that we should document the surgery on video and use it as a hospital promo. Huh? Okay. 'Cause I was thinking that we could focus on Amy Johnson instead of your tv career. Christina. You know, you don't know me, but, uh, I can do both. Prove it. Give me something I can take back to this family so that they can be reassured... ...that their baby girl's gonna be okay. Tell them whatever you want. I'll give you the heads-up when I have the OR slot. Thanks, Tom. Nurse. You know, he's a top gun in the O.R. What he does outside of that room is none of your business. Tom, are you serious? This is about a little girl's life, all right? Not some prime-time special. I've seen him in action. You haven't. Trust me. Amy is getting the best Richmond Trinity has to offer. With everything that she's been through don't you think she deserves the very best? What? What's that look? Richmond Trinity can't give her the very best. Can we? Look, I believe in alan's skills 100%. How many of these procedures has he done? Christina, AVM is very rare, okay? Tom... How many? Five? Two? This'll be his first. No more than four hours, Jake. I don't want Amy under too much stress, okay? All right, thanks, everybody. Hello. Hey. How sweet. You googled AVM. Any, uh, any surgical tips for me from... Web md? Just one. Andrew Ryan at Johns Hopkins. It seems as if he's performed more successful AVM surgeries than anyone in the U.S. He's nearly 70 years old. Whether or not he can still use a scalpel is something I'm not familiar with. Well, performing an AVM surgery is something you're not familiar with, either. Am I correct? I'm a board-certified neurosurgeon with a superior record. This hospital courted me for a year and a half. And so did Johns Hopkins. I wasn't gonna play second fiddle to Ryan. I get it. So, came here to be top dog so nobody would question your authority. You didn't get the memo? Refer Amy to Dr. Ryan... Please. At least let the family know that he exists so they have the option of choosing between the two of you. You mean you haven't told them already? Well, of course, you know that's against policy. Don't pretend like you don't know how medicine is practiced in this country. You need surgery immediately, you get the surgeon on call. Amy Johnson hit the luck of the draw. If she came yesterday, she would've had Bill the butcher. Amy Johnson's not your lab rat. And you're not my boss. Should we make it a big thing, get a bun of people to go? Oh, I'd love to, but Larry said he's not good with crowds. Is that what he said? Well, you know, I could take him out for drinks instead of you. He's not gonna be vulnerable with another man! Men don't understand. You need a woman's touch. You with the touching? Stop it. What? You're being played. Larry is the most under handed, manipulative sleazeball in this hospital, and you're not taking him out for a beer. I don't think we're talking about the same Larry. No? Well, I'll go check it out, then. 'Cause I'd love to meet this other guy. What? This paperwork is totally ludicrous. It's killing us in the E.R. Please, Bobbie, not now, okay? Uh, yes. Hi, it's Christina Hawthorne calling back for Dr. Ryan's office. Waiting times have increased, TPPs are down to 12 minutes, and all because of this? No, I'm just confirming that Dr. Ryan got the films. Yes. And that he will be able to see the... Patient we talked about. Are you sending patient records to an outside doctor? The less you know, the better. Okay? So get out of here. 9:00 a.m.? Fantastic! Thank you so much. Yep. Christina, that's crazy. You can't do that. Oh. I can and I just did. All right? To help a patient. Okay, let me get this straight. You can do whatever you want to help a patient, but the rest of us should just do whatever we're told to do? Bobbie? Didn't I just say I can't deal with this right now? I see it's "do as I say, not as I do." Well, you know what? Administration can kiss my ass. Messenger on the floor! Anybody got labs?! Oh, uh, I do. Uh, wait a minute. Oh, no, I can't wait. I gotta stay on schedule. Excuse me? It's 10 minutes to the hour. If I don't get to the east wing in the next 10 minutes, I'm gonna get in trouble. No. You will wait. I'm a nurse with samples for the lab. You're a messenger. You will wait for my samples. Now stop! And wait. You'll be fine. I don't know anybody at Johns Hopkins. Oh, it doesn't matter. They're gonna fall in love with you as soon as you walk in the door. Hawthorne. Uh, just give me one second. I'll be right back. What the hell are you doing? They made a different choice. Based on what? Just... just out of the blue? Yeah. Just so you know, I never said anything against you, okay? Unbelievable. Do you know that? They're packing their bags! And they have that right! Dr. Phillips? Please. Come in? Beth and I... Beth and I just want to apologize. I just want to let you know I think it's a mistake. I think you should reconsider. Wait. You didn't know? You said he referred me to Dr. Ryan. Well, we didn't want you to have any doubts. You mean you were lying to me? Well, Amy, when I referred your parents to Dr. Ryan... So, this is your fault? This is when I need you the most, and you're making me go away? Amy, that's not it at all. Okay, I want you to have the best. Look at me. I'm a mess. Do you really think that one surgeon can improve the quality of my life? It is possible... Considering you'd be my first case. I don't care. I should go first. I'm not a baby, and I want the surgery now, here. Maybe I can help you learn something. Then the next kid who comes along won't have to watch their parents torture themselves over whether or not you know what you're doing. If that's what you want. It is. All right. Stay away from Candy. I'd be happy to... for a price. Say... 100 bucks? Oh, Larry. You know, I got friends in high places... Well, actually, one friend in particular on the board of this hospital. Amanda Hawthorne... I'm actually her nurse today. Amanda Hawthorne isn't a patient here today. Liar. That's her in 334. See? Jane Doe. Surgical biopsy. It's top secret. You're bluffing. Am I? Oh, suit yourself, Larry. But my friend Amanda will be pretty pissed when she finds out that a hospital accountant has been overpaying nurses in exchange for dates. You know what I'm saying? Fine! No beer with Candy. But you say nothing to no one. Your secret's safe with me. Hey, you're back. So, did you get everything? All right. Let's see what we got here. Okay, CBC, CBC... CBC... What's this? It's not so nice, Isabel. Oh, no. It's ruined. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go back upstairs and get me another sample. I...I can't go back. You don't have a choice, Isabel. You go back and get me that sample, or you're out of a job. I'm sorry about your husband. But he's doing just fine now. You're sorry? For what? Did you make a mistake? No. I... I didn't mean it like that. What did I tell you, Arthur? These people almost killed you! I'm calling our lawyer. Mrs. Tanaka... Your husband had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic. No one is at fault. That nurse should've stayed by his side after she gave the medicine. She was probably on a coffee break or having sex in the closet like you people do! She was negligent! Um, actually, I... I wasn't, and I can prove it. This is a detailed log of my activities today. See? No coffee breaks, no sex closet. Just all nursing, all the time. Right there in black and white... Yellow. And here's the medical history you filled out, indicating no known allergies. Is... is that correct, or did you make a mistake? It's okay. Mistakes happen, especially when you're scared. Um, I need another ABG specimen for this patient. What happened to the first one? I didn't put it on ice. You mean you ruined it. You gonna give it to me or not? It never ceases to amaze me the caliber of people who actually get hired to work in this place! You know what? Two months ago, I was pregnant and living outside of a shopping cart. But now I'm working... With my colleagues. So if you need to kick m in the teeth so you can feel good about yourself, be my guest. But your patient needs an arterial blood gas test, and I'm not the one holding up the show. Show some more hustle this time. Thanks, doctor. Tom. Amanda? Show me your hands. Steady enough for you? No, your pinky looks a little twitchy. Well, you know, I've got a few minutes. I can go practice on a tomato or something. You'll do fine, Amanda. As if I have any control whatsoever over this matter. Well, that's not true. We're partners. You... you think positive, healing thoughts, and I'll try not to drop the scalpel. Oh, what's this? "Amanda, good luck with the surgery! Christina." Which one of you squealed? How does Christina do that? I'll see you in there, Amanda. See you afterwards, okay? Okay. All right. Dr. Ryan agrees. A craniotomy with vascular clipping is the treatment of choice. Hey. Take care of my girl for me. You're a patient in my hospital, and you think I'm not gonna find out? Explain something to me. Are we family or not? You were married to my son, and he's gone. You don't have to pretend to care for me. Okay, for the record, despite everything that's happened between us... ... I do care. Tom. Amanda. I've got your pathology report. All right, well, I'll let you have some privacy with your doctor. Wait. Please stay. All right, Tom. It's negative. No cancer. But your blood results aren't exactly where I'd like them to be, so I ordered a full work-up. Can we get that going? Right away, doctor. Thank you,Tom, for everything. You're very welcome. I'll check on you in the morning. Have a good night. Thank you. Would you like me to get Camille on the phone for you so you can tell her the good news? No. My nurse can do that. I think you should go back to work. I can't have you neglecting your duties on my behalf. I'd never hear the end of it from the board, and they complain about you enough as it is. Okay. You're not gonna, uh, beat me up over this whole secret thing, are you? Oh, no, not this time. You know, considering that you've probably been beat up enough waiting on my mother-in-law all day. Are you kidding? Amanda's awesome. Really? Hmm. Yeah. Honestly, this the best day I've ever had at this hospital. Follow my finger, please? Why? I'm checking for Stockholm syndrome. I was thinking, to celebrate the good news, I would dash out after my shift and grab us a bottle of champagne. Would you like that, Amanda? That's "Mrs. Hawthorne" to you. Now, get out. My night nurse can do this. And don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Oh, hey! Hey! Yeah, I honestly... I don't know what happened with Amanda. It was like a sniper attack. Or just like a drive-by. You know what? I really, really want to hear about it, but I'm on employee-fellowship duty. Hi, Larry! Ready for that beer? You betcha. I just have to go clock out. Okay? I thought we had a deal. Yeah, we did. But then I realized... Amanda Hawthorne had surgery today. And how do I know that? Oh, right, you told me. Violating patient confidentiality. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. For a price. Ready to rock 'n' roll? Anywhere you want to go, Candy. I've got plenty of cash. No, no, no. Your money is no good here. I'm treating. If you insist. Okay, so I was thinking... margaritas. 'Cause I like margaritas. But only if you want... You're gonna be fine, okay? Don't forget, you watch me on the "Today Show." Hey. Thank you. Well... Looks like you're as... good as you think you are. I knew you'd come around. I wouldn't take it that far. Well, that doesn't sound like much of an apology. It's not. Matter of fact, if I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change a thing. How's my favorite patient? I'm very sleepy. Dr. Phillips said that everything went great. He expects a full recovery. Oh, we can say amen for that. Listen, if there's anything that I did that made this harder for you, I'm sorry. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been able to stick up for myself. What's this I hear about a flap between Phillips and Hawthorne? No big deal. The patient stayed at Trinity. The surgery was a success. No harm, no foul. Hey, you... hey. You page me? No. Come on in. We're talking about... the Phillips situation. But I'm glad you're here. Phillips give you a hard time today? Uh, we had a bit of a disagreement, but in the end it all worked out. I'm happy to hear that. Because if it hadn't, uh, worked out, it'd be a real problem. So, uh, you talked to another surgeon at Johns Hopkins. Is that what set him off? The family needed a second opinion. Isn't that your area? Uh, I met with the family and advised them that Dr. Phillips was the man for the job. Help me understand this. Despite advice from our two top surgeons, you sent medical records to a doctor in a different hospital? A world-renowned expert in AVM. Did the parents request this? They gave their consent. Written consent? They told me to do what I needed to do. What does that mean? Did you have explicit consent to send the records or not? I had a moral obligation... To commit a federal crime. You violated hospital protocol, you offended our rock-star surgeon, and you deliberately broke the law, then said you'd do it all again tomorrow. If I report this, which I'm obligated to do, we open up this hospital to a huge liability. Should I report you to the authorities? I think you should do what you feel is best. How about you? You think I ought to turn her in? No. So then I become the bad guy, and I have to sweep it under the rug. And the three of us here makes it a conspiracy, which makes me feel dirty. Well, I wouldn't want that, so, if you want me to turn in my resignation... I considered it. But, unlike you, I don't make decisions while I'm hot. Do me a favor... Stay home tomorrow. Think about what you did. And I'll consider my moral obligation to this hospital. Have a good night. All right, did you clean the kitchen? Camille, just do it. All right? Thank you. Bye. "8:35, Bobbie apologizes to Christina for being a melodramatic a-hole." "At 8:36, Christina apologizes to Bobbie for being a freaking hypocrite." How bad was it with Morrissey? I'll live. What the hell is that? Root beer. Ah. Need something way stronger than that tonight. So it was bad. I'll tell you all about it if you buy me a real drink. Sounds serious. Well, on the bright side, I don't have to get up early tomorrow morning. I get to sleep in. You don't know how to sleep in. That's true. I'm damn sure gonna try. All right. "9:06, cranberry and vodka." "9:18, lose the cranberry."
