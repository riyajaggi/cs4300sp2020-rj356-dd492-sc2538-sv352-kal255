 Janet, I'll see you next time. Good night. Hey, what's up? All right. Good night, you guys. Christina! - Christina! - So close! Yes, Kelly? - Um... Janelle just called. - She's on her way, because she's covering the whole house tonight. So she's saying, "oh, I'm stuck in traffic. I'm gonna be there any minute." Um, not exactly. 'Cause I'm about to go home and open up a nice bottle of red wine,

 slip into something real comfortable, and relax with my man The Rock in "The Scorpion King," and I know she wouldn't ruin that for me. I'm sorry. She called in sick. Right. She called in sick. Right. Transcripted by chamallow35 for Oh, Ray, are you clocking out? - Uh, yeah. - Oh, nice. So, uh, are you free tonight? I've got a proposal for you. Whoa! Easy, big guy. You're not really my type. Yeah, I'm free tonight. Why? Great. Um, okay, here's the deal...my friend Alex plays in this hockey league,

 and I totally forgot I promised I'd be medic at the game tonight. - Uh-huh. - But I've got a really hot date. I was just wondering if maybe you could help me out and cover for me. Uh... Look, all you'd have to do is sit in the stands and enjoy the game. You'd be doing me a huge favor. Besides, you like hockey, right? Sure, yeah, of c... I mean, what's not to like, right? Here's the address. Thanks. - Appreciate it. - No, thankyou. I thought you left. Well, just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in. Okay, please don't do that. And please don't tell me you're crazy enough to think you can work a straight 24. Say hello to my lil' friend. I'm gonna stay, if only to make sure you stop with these painful slurs. Please don't. You'll only slow me down. Just for that... Good night. You know the only good thing about the night shift is when the ER gets all nice and... Candy! Da! Don't! - ... quiet. - Why you got to jinx us like that? You know you can't talk about how quiet the ER is, even if it's like the morgue. Are you superstious? - Honey, what's your name? - Crystal. - My water broke. - Okay, let's have a seat. Now, don't forget to breathe. Okay, just remember... This is the beginning of the happiest night of your life. You know what? I'm gonna call labor and delivery and tell them you guys are on your way. Okay, good. Listen, I promise, once you see that baby, you'll forget all about this pain. - Who's your OB? - He's in Dunbar. West Virginia? Isabel, is that you? Nope. Isabel. Never heard of her. My name's Coa. Last name, "Puffs." Isabel, it's me... Bobbie, from the ER. Miss cha-cha-cha, the one-legged wonder. What are you doing? Shopping. You want some grilled cheese? What about your messenger job? Christina said you were doing great. Christina don't know squat. I'm the one that had to pass that NICU every day and see that empty incubator where Moses was. Listen, let me give you a lift to the shelter. I ain't going back to that flophouse. I'm tired of fighting for the lower bunk. I'm just tired... - tired of fighting. - You can't spend tonight on the street. Get in the car. You ain't gonna tell Christina, is you? She gonna get all hurt and disappointed. I promise. I ain't looking for no charity. I'm not offering any. Get in. All right, we're gonna get you all set up in here. No stress. It's gonna feel like your own living room. This is nicer. Most of the time, we live out of our car. "We"? What are you, about 18? Hm. Yeah, I was about your age when I was pregnant with my daughter. We moved into my husband's tiny bachelor pad in his mom's basement. It was awful. But we made it work. Your contractions are 10 minutes apart. Looks like he or she is taking their sweet time. It's a boy. Really? That's fantastic. Are your parents on their way? What about the father? When will the doctor be here? I'll go check on that. You still here? Don't you know? I live here. What are you laughing at? Bond... Tom Bond. Very funny. For your information, I have a hot date that I'm taking to a fundraising dinner. Really? What are you, the emcee? It's black tie. You know, not all of us spend our free time with our dvd player and a gallon of chocolate ice cream. I have no idea what you're talking about. And for your information, it's a gallon of strawberry ice cream. Oh! Oh, I see. Well, you have a good night. I will. Yeah, tons of fun headed my way. Hi, excuse me. We are looking for crystal Raymond's room. Oh, are you her parents? Uh, no. I'm Aaron Brier. This is my wife, Gretchen. Oh, I'm Christina Hawthorne, chief nursing officer. Are you family? Well, yes, now we are now. She's, uh, having our baby. We're the adoptive parents. She didn't tell you she was giving her baby up for adoption? No. Oh, poor thing. She must be so overwhelmed. Yeah. Can we see her? Uh, I'm sorry. I can't do that until she tells me it's okay. - Oh, we can't wait to meet him. - Yeah. I'll tell you what. Why don't you two go have a seat, and I'll go tell her you're here? - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - Yep. - Get out! - I just want to talk to you! I don't want to talk to you! Why did you leave? Why did you act so crazy? Hey, hey. You got to take this outside. - What?! - You got to leave this room right now. I'm Curtis. I'm the father. I don't want you here. I don't need you here. Please, - get him out! - I'm not going anywhere! Okay, Curtis, we can talk about your baby outside. - The adoptive parents are here. - Why are you doing this?! Get out! I'm not leaving! Code gray! Room 334! Code gray! Code gray? What the hell is that? Curtis, you're about to be a father. For that, I congratulate you. It's a blessed thing. - Who did you just call? - Hey, relax. Okay? You got to listen to me really closely. Your baby is in distress. That's why I need you to come outside with me... so Crystal and your baby can stay stress-free. Son... - You need to step outside and get some air. - I'm not going anywhere! I'm just gonna talk to her! Son, either go outside or go to jail. Take your pick. You okay? The baby's fine. He's gonna keep coming back. - He's gonna hurt me. - No. He's gonna have to go through me first. - And you'll keep him away from me? - I promise. If you promise me to lie back, close your eyes, and stay calm. Okay? Okay. Thanks, Christina. Close your eyes. Alex? Alex? Excuse me. Alex? Alex? Anybody here know an Alex? - Alex? - Alex. Yeah, I know Alex. Hey, Alex! Over here! Can I help you? - Hi. - Oh, are you with the Ice Capades? 'Cause we booked this rink like a month ago. No. No, I'm not with the Ice Capades. Of course not. Actually, Tom sent me. Asked me to fill in as medic. - Such a loser. - Yeah. I ask him for one favor, and he bails. - Oh, Tom. - What is it, a work thing? Well, he... he said something about a hot date. Yeah, see, now, that's why I don't date doctors. You're all assholes. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. Oh, game's about to start. Why don't you go sit in the bleachers, and I'll call you if I need you, all right? All right. I'll just be over there if you need me. What's the matter, your maid went on vacation? Do I look like I can afford a maid? No, but you look like you could afford a mop. It's a nice place, though. How much this cost? An arm and a leg. Maybe just a leg. You got that dark sense of humor. I like that. Make yourself comfortable. You hungry? Oh, I ain't never met a meal I didn't like. I got to make a market run. Pasta okay? You ain't got nothing else besides noodles? If I don't never see another cup of ramen, it'll be too soon. - I'll order a pizza. - Oh, good. Half pepperoni, half mushroom. And deep dish... none of that thin-crust crap. I can't stand to be scammed. Oh, God. Mm. Ma's a little funky-dunky. You mind if I borrow your shower? No. Be my guest. I like being a guest. Hey... Holler at me when the 'za's here. 'Kay. I totally agree with you. I got this! Stop the game! Coming through. - Who the hell are you? - I'm a medic. Back off. I said back up now! Move! Can you hear me? Are you familiar with the game of ice hockey? Yeah, sure. It's hockey. On ice. Pushing each other into the boards is called checking. It's what we do. It's kind of the whole point of the game. I'm sorry. I thought you were hurt. I'm team captain. I'm never hurt. Okay, I'm sorry. I just want to help you, that's all. You want to help me? Go back to those stands, and anytime one of those crazy bitches checks me or one of my girls, yell at them. Say anything you want, but just make sure it's something nasty. - Yell something nasty. - Got it. Yeah, and don't you come back on this ice until you see blood shooting from somebody's head. Got it. Blood shooting out. Okay. - Hey, froot loop? - Yes? What say you guys make out later? We're in the middle of a game here? I'm sorry. I apologize. Cool. - Thanks, Ray. - Okay. Thank you. Dunbar, West Virginia. Residence. Donald Raymond. Okay. Thanks. We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial again. Disconnected? What the hell? What are you still doing here? Patient spiked a fever in recovery. Oh, that must have put a damper on your hot date. No, not really. She's waiting for me in the lobby. - You left your date in the lobby? - Yeah. You're clearly not trying to get laid tonight. Why don't you let me worry about that? Besides, I'll be quick. I'll be in and out. I'm... I'm just gonna go now. Okay. 30 minutes, my ass. - So, where was I? - High-school hoops. Oh, yeah, girl. I dominated. I'll take you to the low blocks, post you up, make you my bitch! Pat Summitt from Tennessee wanted me so bad, and then I blew out my acl. Nasty. All that from being scoped? And a staph infection, three more surgeries, oxycontin addiction. It was bye-bye, scholarship, hello, streets. All happened like a blur. So you just gave up hope. "Hope is the thing with feathers." Emily Dickinson. I'm impressed. The crap I remember. Personal question? What's up? I ain't got no secrets. Who was Moses' father? I don't remember. Pass the pepperoni? Okay, cool. Will you set it up for me? All right. Call me when you get here. Bye. Hey, can I help you? The information desk sent us up here. You have an expectant mother. Crystal? Are you family? We will be once her baby's born. So, you're here with the Briers. We're here for Crystal Raymond. We're adopting her baby. Excuse me? I don't understand. Who are you people? We've known Crystal since she was 3 months' pregnant. - We've been paying bills... - So have we. We have papers. We went through a legitimate agency. So did we. This is all legal. You're both right. I contacted your agency in West Virginia and yours in Georgia. The problem is that there's... been double-dipping. The baby's been promised to both of you. How could she do this? It's easier than you would think, unfortunately. This is crazy. She flees the state and then calls us both here? How could this happen? - It's gonna be fine. - What does that mean? It means they are criminals, and that is our baby! - Like hell it is. We've got the same papers. - I don't care what papers you have. That's baby's going home with us, and that is it! - Okay, okay. All right. Please. - Please, please. Okay? This is all gonna work out, one way or another. But right now, I got a baby that's looking to be born, so I need everybody to cooperate. So, if you would kindly go to the waiting room down the hall, - and if you two... - I'm calling our lawyer. Hey. How are you? Good. Better. Good. Man, it's nice and peaceful in here. It's a zoo outside. Really? Yeah. Yeah. I've got, uh... Four people who have legal documents, claiming to be the, uh, adoptive parents to your baby. You want to tell me what's going on? They're good people. I mean... They'd all be really good parents, but... I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I just... I don't know what to do. You have to tell me what to do. I can't. It's not my place. I knew that we'd never get away with it. I knew that people would find out. Are you telling me that Curtis forced you to do this, that this is his scheme? He made me go through with everything. That's why I can't have him here... Because he wants to give away my baby. Please... You have to help me. You are not making my night any easier. How was the pizza? You know, I could get it down I was thinking of saving some for later. Cool. So, you don't wear that thing 24/7? No. Irritates the stump. Can I... check it out? Yeah, have at her. This is some old "Star Wars"- type bullshit. What's this made out of? Titanium. That's that stuff them terrorists be sneaking around with? No, I... I think you're thinking plutonium. Tomay-to, tomah-to. You ever hit a baseball with this thing? Uh... no. How'd you lose your leg? Um, skydiving. Me, I ain't jumping out of no planes unless it's on fire. Yeah, chute opened late. Lucky I wasn't killed. I'll bet. Especially after that shark swam up and chewed your leg off. And then, to make matters worse, that truck rolled over on you. How'd you hear all that stuff? Hospital messengers get around. So... What's the real story? Doesn't matter, does it? Guess not if you're a liar. - I, uh, hope you'll be okay on the couch. - Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry about calling you a liar. I've been called worse. Good... 'cause the truth is overrated. I told this woman at the shelter that, uh, Moses had been cured of his spina bifida, and he was living with my sister in a mansion with a rose garden all around... And that I visit every day and rock him under the shade of a big tree. So, you can lose your leg any way you want to, miss cha-cha-cha. Good night, Isabel. Good night. Coffee? They keep the air-conditioning on blast in here for some reason. I'm Christina. I'm Faye. Thanks. Did Tom send you? Um... yeah, he was kind of bummed that, uh, your date got interrupted with work stuff. Yeah, well, it's happened three dates in a row, so I'm getting pretty used to it. Do you know Tom well? Somewhat. I mean, in a professional way. We work together, so... Well, seeing as how work is all he does, you guys must be pretty close. Well, the job is all-consuming. It's very difficult to have a social life outside of it. Yeah? Do you leave your dates stranded in the lobby? You're confusing me with someone who actually has dates. Oh, come on, look at you. I'm sure you have a date every other night. But Tom... whew! Getting that guy to get dressed up and go out is like pulling teeth. I mean, I understand being dedicated to your job and all, but sooner or later, you're gonna have to get a life, right? It's, uh... it's sad, actually. I guess it is. And the thing is, I really like him. Smart, funny, gorgeous. But do I really want to spend my evenings in a lobby, reading 6- month-old magazines? I mean, when I think of a date, I think wine, I think candles, I th... Finally. Hey. Hey. Uh, Faye, I... I'm so sorry. His fever's down, but his pulse is ragged. We have to run some tests. It's gonna be a little while. Do you want me to call you a cab or something? Well, how much longer? 20 minutes? Okay. Sorry. Excuse me. What... what were you doing in there? She wanted coffee. What are you doing? You know you're gonna be longer than 20 minutes. Look, I... I'm trying, okay? What, is she pissed? Well, yeah, kind of. What am I supposed to do? This is my job. Maybe I should do what you do. Which is? Forget dating and stick with my dvd. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Low blow over there. That's not cool. That's not... Wasn't cool. At all. Not cool. Come on! Come on, Ref, what are you, blind? Throw her in the penalty box! Yeah! See? Hey, what's with that dude? I thought this was supposed to be a women's hockey league! That's my wife. Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. No, I mean, I'm sorry that I said that. I heard you were camped out here. Looks like you've gotten yourself in a bit of a mess. I'm sorry. I blew it. But I have to be here. I have to see him. You go upstairs right now, you're gonna have a hell of a fight on your hands. I'll behave myself. - Please, let me talk to Crystal. - Curtis, for real, don't make me code-red your ass, all right? I need to see him born. And what... What good is that gonna do? You're forcing her to give up the baby? You need the money that bad? She said I did that? It was not me. - Oh. Really? No? - It was her. It was all her. - That's not what she says. - Look, when Crystal brought up adoption, I was fine with it. Okay. Then what are you doing here? I realized I wanted to keep him. She agreed we would talk about it after the baby was born. But when I got back to the hotel room, she was gone. I knew she planned to leave the state. This is right off I-95. This is a mess. Do your parents know what's going on? Have you talked to them? When I got Crystal pregnant, - they just... - Curtis... Let me tell you something. There is a big difference between, "oh, my God, my son got somebody pregnant," and, "oh, my God, what a beautiful baby." Ray! What the hell happened to you? - Were you in a fight? - Yeah, a little bit. Oh, what... How's the other guy? Oh, you should see him. That must've been some fight. Hey. Ray? - Hey. - Hey. Listen, I just want to apologize for that punch. - You still dizzy? - No, I'm really good. Thank you. No hard feelings? - Nope. - All right. You poor thing. The way that that tiny skater just attacked you. Don't you have work to do right now? Hey. Come with me. All right. Let me take a look. At what? All right, tough girl. FYI... you are in the ER, you're supposed to be injured, even a team captain. Come on. There's no question this is broken. Hang on. Linda! Everything will be fine. Linda here is gonna reset it, and then this will just be our secret, all right? - Hey. - Thanks. Hey. Thanks, doc. My pleasure. I knew something was wrong months ago. She kept asking for things, more money. She's been extorting us all along. Who did you make these arrangements with? Was it Curtis or Crystal? Crystal, of course. Sorry. We've been through this twice already. We knew we had to deal with the mother. Curtis signed away all of his rights. He ... he couldn't change his mind if he wanted to. I can't pack up that nursery. We even painted it another color. And I can't have my friends pat me on the back, saying, "your baby's still out there. Your baby will find you." Please, help us. I wish I could. But there's nothing I can do. Social services will be here in a couple hours. And in all honesty, it may take weeks to get all this resolved. Oh... Well... it's happening again. No baby. Let's go home. No, I told you. Curtis threatened me. He told me that if I didn't follow through, - he was gonna hurt my... - You know what? Stop it, please. I'm way too tired, so don't even try to play me. Because this was your idea. These couples are already paying the agencies. I just asked for a little bit more. I didn't hurt anyone. These people came here for a baby, empty-handed. Do you understand that that is like a death? They have money and lawyers. They can always get another one. They are desperate for a baby... Your baby... And you took advantage of them. You know, I thought I could finally catch a break. I have no one. No money, no family. What they paid me, it's less than their SUV. Crystal, this is a baby we are talking about, not a truck! Oh, my God! Something's happening. Karen, call her OB. Look at me. You are about to be a mother. So it's time to grow up. He's so cute. Who? - Ray? - Yeah, he's cute, and he's smart and sensitive. He's not like these other boneheads that hang around the rink. He's definitely a unique guy. Wait a minute. Wait, are you guys... No, no. Me and Ray? Definitely... Definitely not. And as far as I know, he's available. Do you think I'm his type? Yeah, sure. Just ask him. Some guys don't like that whole aggressive-female thing, you know? Yeah, well, if you're waiting for Ray to make the first move, you're gonna wait forever. So, you're sure you don't mind if I ask him out? Why would I mind? Go for it. It's not working. I can't do this. That's really not good enough, Crystal. You got to figure out what you are gonna do. I came here to deliver my baby. Thank you for your help with that, but the rest of it's my business. Is that him? Give him to me. You can't give him away. You already signed the contracts. It's my decision now. Is... is that true? I'm afraid only the mother has the right to change her mind within 48 hours. Crystal, please. Please, I know... I know you don't think I can do this. You don't love me. But I can do this. I want to, and I can. What is it? Money? Here. It's all I have, but I'll get more. Whatever you want, whatever you need. I want to be a father. Please. Let me keep our baby. Let me have my son. - Hey. - Hey. I was wondering if I could get your number. My num... Uh, yeah. I heard you were available. Really? Uh, where did you hear that? That nurse... Candy? She said that you were available. Oh, well, I guess I am... available. Tell you what. I will give you my number. - That's great. - And, um... Then you can call me if you want. No pressure. Thanks for everything, Ray. You're welcome, captain. - Hey. - Hey. That, uh, that hockey player gave me her number. - Really? - Yeah. - She seems nice. - Yeah, she really does. Yeah, I think I'll call her. - You should. - I will. - Good. - Good. Oh, excuse me, miss? Do you know where room 334 is? Are you here for Crystal Raymond's baby? - Yes. - Yes. You're not here to adopt, are you? No, no, no. We're Curtis' parents. Oh, you got my message. - Oh, yes! - Oh, hey! Thank you so much. Thank you. Here, come with me. Oh, God. - Hi. - Hey, Curtis. - Mom. - Hi, hon. - Dad. - Hey. I'm gonna keep him... Be his dad. Crystal's giving me custody. - Where is Crystal? - She's been moved to postpartum. She's resting and thinking about how to make it right with some very disappointed people. Oh, honey. He's beautiful. Let's go home. Did you see someone here in a cocktail dress? Um, she left about 15 minutes ago. Got it. Thanks. What are you doing? - I'm not doing anything. - What... what I... what is all this? Wine, cold pizza, candles? This is very romantic. - What, you didn't set all this up for me, did you? - Well, I didn't do it by myself, but you must admit that caf? Christina is much nicer than the hospital lobby, right? - Absolutely. - Okay. I'm sorry Faye left. Yeah. - This was really sweet of you. Thank you. - You're welcome. You know what? Let's crack that pizza open. No need for all this to go to waste, right? Okay. So, did you stabilize your guy today? Yep. Finally. How was your all-nighter? - Quiet? - Are you kidding me? Please. But I must say it's nice ending with some cold pizza. I agree. Which is probably why Faye and I are not gonna work out. That's harsh, don't you think? You gonna dump a girl just because she doesn't want to spend her nights in a hospital lobby with cold pizza? No, it's not that. She kind of reminds me of my ex-wife. Ex-wife? You were married? Yeah. We married in medical school. It didn't last through residency. That's young. What am I talking about? I got married even younger than that. Yeah, but yours worked out. Mine ended before I knew for sure. What does that mean? Well... What other secrets do I not know about you? Uh, secrets. Oh, um... Je suis n? ? Paris. Je suis elev? En France. Mon p?re y habite toujours. You speak French? Et, uh... je te trouve tr?s jolie... un peu bizarre, tr?s dr?le, merveilleuse. What does that mean? It means that I'm really tired and probably should get some sleep. You know what? You got that right. But all that French? Yeah, you need to do more of that around here, for sure. I am assisting on a laparoscopy in 20 minutes. Ah, you think you might want to get some sleep? Well... Hasta manana. That's all I got. - Hey, Christina. - Yeah? I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Okay. Good morning. I thought you retired old squeaky leg. I lied. You look like hell. Hard day's night. - Where's Isabel? - Gone. How the hell did you let that happen? Oh, don't pin it on me. Well, where did she go? My guess? She's back on the street, dumpster-diving. - Ooh, that's cold. - Not really, considering she stole from me. Isabel stole from you? Come on. Here's the thing. You can't always make people be who you want them to be. My good samaritan days are officially over. She's all yours. Did she take something valuable? Transcripted on Addic7ed by chamallow35
