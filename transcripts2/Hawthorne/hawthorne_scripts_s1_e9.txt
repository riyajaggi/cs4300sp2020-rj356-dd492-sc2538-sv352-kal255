 This is gonna be a cage match, and I need to focus. You want me to cover the whole house? Day surgery and OR have light loads today, so there aren't be many beds. - Got it? - Got it? Make sure you check the CPR updates, and remember that Jackie has the in-service schedules. - Got it. - Okay. I just can't believe you're letting someone else drive. I can't, either, but... I got to go slay the dragon in his lair. And it's hot today. I cannot let him see me sweat. And, by all means, don't let any of these jokers around here see you sweat.

 Got it? (cell phone ringing) Got it. Hello? Hey, mom, Suzanne invit... No. I didn't even ask you a question yet. You said you were gonna hear me out, remember? Okay, you're right. What? Let's try it again. Mother, Suzanne invited me to her cousin's boyfriend's house in Virginia Beach this weekend. Mm-hmm. And I'm going. All right? No. What?! It's gonna be like 90 degrees this weekend. Camille, I can't hear you. Oh, my good... You're breaking up. You're... can you... Shhhh. Hello? Hell... I taught you that. What am I supposed to tell her if she calls back? Ignore her. Your hands are gonna be full. Now, remember, check the evening sick calls by 4:00 so you can have everybody covered by 6:00. Stop worrying. I got it. You just go slay that dragon. Don't get barbecued. I won't. She's toast. # HawthoRNe 1x09 # Mothers Day Original Air Date on August 11, 2009 transcript by honeybunny sync, corrections [HI] by elderman I can't save him. (Morrissey) You've done all you can. Dr. Weston's case load isn't what it used to be. Well, he's 65 years old. And he's had a great run. So, we're just gonna kick him to the curb? I'd love everyone to keep their job. I'd love to have us all ride into the sunset together, but I have to make tough choices. Weston is not pulling his weight. But we've cut so much already... 5%, maybe 10% across the board. You want blood from a stone? What about all the incoming cash from when Sacred Heart closed its doors? I'm pouring that into Ortho and Geriatrics. Those budgets are fine. Peds is hurting. Baby boomers are our fastest-growing client population. They need hip replacements, extended care. You're unbelievable. Like it or not, this hospital needs a guy like me. Yeah? That's funny. I thought it needed a guy like Weston... experienced and talented. You want to tell him, or should I? Float Melissa to the CCU after lunch, and I'll pull Tammy Lee from 4 West. Okay. Well, call me back if there's a problem. Thanks. Three discharges on medicine, so send up Kellerman, Reynolds, and Gray. Three discharges already? That never happens. Don't tell Christina. (woman) Help me, somebody! Please! That doesn't sound right. Help! Help! Help, please! Please, my mother! Help me! Oh, God. Mom. Mom! - Get a gurney and some help. - Okay. How long has she been unconscious? It just started when she was getting out of the car. Before that, she was slurring her words, and then she just started shaking. - What's her name? - Shirley Riddell. Shirley, my name is Bobbie. I'm gonna help you. Mom! - Has this happened before? - No, no. - Is there any history of medical problems? - No, no. Is she on any medications? I... I don't know. I... I don't think so, no. No, no. Mom, it's gonna be okay! Oh, my God. - What's your name? - Maureen. Maureen, she's in good hands. It's gonna be okay. (Kelly) 1, 2, 3. Oh, my God. Let's go. [ car door closes, beep ] Let's go. (Dr. Marshall) What do we got? Possible stroke. Daughter brought her in. This is Maureen. Start an O2 monitor. I'm gonna ask you a few questions while I examine your mom, okay? Did she... Did she have a stroke? We're gonna find out. [ cell phone ringing ] It's the ICU. Kelly, you got this? (Kelly) Yes. - Bobbie Jackson. - Blood pressure's normal. When did you first notice a change in her behavior? I was driving home, and she started shaking. So I thought it was a seizure, and I just drove right here. Smart... treatment of a stroke in the first three hours is critical. That's the good news. You brought her in so quickly. - Did she complain of a headache or dizziness? - No. - Does she have a history of high blood pressure? - No. - Migraines? - No. Excuse me. - Is she a smoker? - No. - Drugs or alcohol? - No. - History of seizures? - No. Any medications whatsoever right now? No, she was totally healthy. Get her scanned and prepare her for TPA. We're gonna take good care of her. You're gonna be okay, mom. It's gonna be okay. [ siren ] I need those revisions in an hour, Tom. You got any pointers? Yeah. Why don't you try driving a stake through his heart? Hawthorne! He's got a heart? Yes, sir. Good luck. Okay... - Quick question before we start. - Yes. Budget code 3050, you've got $4,000 budgeted for last quarter. That's this year's Critical Care Conference in Boston. - The ER and ICU Head nurses attend. - Why? Well, it's for, you know, just continuing education... We pay their salaries while they're there? Well, of course. See, last year... Two years in a row? No. Nursing doesn't change that much. They can go on their own dime. Okay, well, before we even get into that, - I... I have some other cuts that I'd... - Great. We need those, too. As for Continuing Ed, have them check out the internet. Shall we begin? (Larry) Guys, I'm telling you, I've seen the numbers. The hospital's about to make some major cuts. We're talking layoffs. They say that every year, and nothing happens. They'll cut the cost-of-living increase. So what? You're not hearing me. It's Armageddon. Trust me. And you know who's gonna take the hit? It's not gonna be the doctors. It's not gonna be the nurses. It's gonna be the people... You and me. (choking) Is he choking? - Oh, my god. What do we do?! - Call 911! It's a hospital, idiot! There's a code to call. - Somebody, do something! - What is it? All right. All right. (continues choking) Come on. Come on! (throws up) (crowd) Oh! Hey, man, that was awesome! [ applause ] Way to go! Did you see that? Yeah. Thank you. (gaging) Maureen? - It's okay. - Calm down. You're in the hospital, mom. You're okay. Okay? Is the medication working? It's too soon to tell. Well, when do we know? Um, well, each patient is different, so you should probably ask Dr. Marshall when she gets here. Yeah, but can you tell me anything, Kelly? I mean, if she... if she had a seizure, is she gonna have more? What does it all mean? We have to trust the doctors and just stay positive. Your mother is in the best place she can possibly be right now. - Yeah. Yeah, you're right. - All right? And she's getting exactly the treatment that she needs. Right. Because you brought her in exactly at the right time. -Maur-- - It's okay. It's okay. We're gonna take really good care of you, okay? I knew this was gonna be a weird day as soon as she got up. -What do you mean? - Uh, she just wasn't herself. Hasn't been for days. Can you give me an example? She dropped her coffee cup at breakfast this morning. I asked her what happened, and she answered me in some... gibberish. What did she say? It... It didn't make any sense. She's just getting older, I guess. Why didn't you tell Dr. Marshall? I didn't think of it. The doctor has to know everything so that she can make the right diagnosis. I thought that I did. What happened after she dropped the coffee? I don't know. Um... I cleaned it up. No, I mean, was she walking normally, or was she acting funny? Why? What are you getting at? Well, the TPA can be dangerous if it's taken outside the three-hour window. It can cause intercranial bleeding and make the stroke even worse. But Dr. Marshall didn't say that. You didn't exactly tell Dr. Marshall everything you told me. I mean, she was just going off of the information that you gave her. It's okay. Just tell me when the symptoms really started. No, mom, you're okay. It's okay. - You're scaring me. - No, I'm just trying to help. I don't know when it began, honest. Okay. I'll be right back. - Where's Bobbie? - Where isn't she? Better try her cell. Hello? I have some information about Dr. Marshall's stroke patient that I think is really important. My advice is if it's Dr. Marshall's patient, talk to Dr. Marshall. Okay, I was gonna do that. I just thought... (beep) Okay. All right. 10% cut across the board, 12% in some areas. Let's run through it again. Are there cameras in here? Because I feel like i'm being punk'd. - I don't know what that means. - It means I got no more, Morrissey. I don't know what to tell you. If I don't hit a number with the board tonight, you know what happens? We all lose our jobs. The board is considering outsourcing all administrative functions of this hospital. They'll hire someone to run it, to make all decisions regarding management, finance, and patient care. Unbelievable. They've already received three bids. Each one worse than the last one. It's my job tonight to convince the board that turning this hospital into a Wal*Mart is a bad idea. They won't listen to reason. It's all about numbers. (sighs) You need to cut your staff. Morrissey, I've given you six positions. Those were unfilled FTE's, not real money. Okay, well, then, I'll give up my cost-of-living increase. You did that last year. It's not even on the budget. I don't have anyone to spare. You'd rather let some private contractor make this decision for you? You have no choice. I need the names of six nurses you're willing to fire by the end of the day. Oh. Dr. Rudman to Pathology. Dr. Marshall? Hi. Sorry. Sorry to bother you. What is it? There's a chance that your stroke patient, Shirley, might've had the stroke earlier than you think. Why? Her daughter just told me that she went to bed with a headache last night and she was acting weird when she woke up today. That's not what she told me. Oh, I know. She didn't remember it at the time. Oh. I'll talk to her. See, that's the problem... Because once she found out about the three-hour TPA window, she kind of changed her story. Or maybe she had time to think about it and now remembers clearly. Isn't receiving TPA after the three-hour window dangerous? My grandfather died of a stroke, so I know a lot about it. Oh! Then maybe you should treat Shirley, huh? No, I just wanted you to know. And now I do. Thank you. Anything else you want to pass along to me? You sure? Yeah? Is my breath bad? Are my roots showing? No? Good. Yep, everything's fine. I don't know. I feel like I still got a piece of doughnut stuck in my throat. Maybe we should do an X-ray to be sure. It's not necessary. Maybe it's one of those ghost-limb things that amputees get. You scratched your mucus membrane. I'm clearing you to go back to work. You don't think I should go home, take a few days off? Mm, nope. Maybe you should check the ribs again. I feel broken. -You know the weird thing? - um. - Even as I was staring death in the face, - umnh I was never scared. You weren't? I realized I have so much to give to the world. Well... You can start now. You are my guardian angel. Me or Ray? You're really lucky he was there. Mm... I practically saved myself. huh! Hi, Ray. Hi. Just was, uh... You know, I just wanted to check on Larry. Oh, you know Larry. He's a fighter. I mean, I heard that thing practically dislodged itself. Uh, no, actually. No, trust me... He was turning very blue. Ray, nurses don't need credit for saving lives. It's just what we do. Any available II Nurse. Any available II Nurse. - Oh, hey, Mike. - Yes? - You got a minute? - Sure. Thanks. What's up? Oh, just spent the morning in Morrissey's office, getting shredded to pieces. Ah, yes. He's an ass. Trying to run this like a business. Well, you know those Wall Street guys. So, what's he making you do? Oh, just, uh, cutting... more than I ever have in the OR. Well, give him what he wants. If we're in the red, so what? We still have a lot of patients to care for. Mike, um... You've been a huge asset to this hospital, a mentor. Wait, wait, wait. Is that what this is? After 27 years? I'm afraid so. (signs) You're kidding. I'm sorry. (sighs) There's... there's a severance. I'll be out of here by Friday. Well, I'm... I'm afraid it has to be now. What? (sighs) They're worried about patient confidentiality, all your records and vandalism. I'm 66 years old. I'm not a vandal. I- I know. I know you're not. They'll pack up your things and send them to you, but they want you to leave the premises now. I'm so sorry. So am I. Do I at least get one phone call, to tell my wife I'll finally be home on time for dinner? Sure. [ slapping ] [ door opens, closes ] This is Shirley Riddell, admitted with stroke-related symptoms. C.T. Scan showed no evidence of aneurysm, and she was administered a full course of TPA. - Any improvement? - Not yet. Excuse me, Dr. Wakefield. Um... I'm wondering if Shirley should be getting the TPA at all. (Dr. Marshall) That's not necessary, Kelly. Can you come here... Both of you? What isn't necessary? I discussed Shirley's condition with her daughter after Dr. Marshall's examination. This nurse is concerned that I misunderstood the stroke time line before I made my diagnosis. Based on what? Her mother was showing first symptoms of a stroke yesterday. And again this morning, she woke up disoriented, she dropped her coffee cup at breakfast, she was having trouble speaking... all hours before the seizure. Is that true? That's not what I was told during my initial examination of the patient. - I told you, but you told me... - But nurses second-guessing doctors in the ER has become an olympic sport, hasn't it? And, frankly, Tom, I'm sick of it. What made you so certain it was an ischemic? Abrupt onset of symptoms, impaired speech functioning... Which could have been due to her postictal state. Which is a result of her stroke. - Did the CT show any signs of thrombosis? - No. And there was no fever, no abnormal cerebrospinal fluid, so I ruled out encephalitis. If you want, I'll run another battery of tests... see if we get different results. No, there might be an easier way. Your mother is in serious condition. It's imperative that we make a quick and accurate diagnosis. If Kelly's right, we need to take your mother off this medication immediately, and then we can determine what really caused the seizure. Just tell them what you told me. She said it was a miracle drug, so shouldn't my mother be on it? Well, TPA is very effective under the right circumstances. Under the wrong ones, it could kill her. It -- it may have started last night. Okay, stop the infusion and get her up to the ICU. Doctor, have your team take over. -Chart, please. - Right. Oh, Tom, that was a nice slap in the face. Thank you. He's the neurologist, okay? I meant the mini girl. Don't ever cut me down in front of a nurse again, okay? Don't even start with me today, Brenda, okay? I just hope that we got that right. That is why we're here, isn't it? Oh, stop the fake drama. Please. You're only protecting the nurses because of your girlfriend, Hawthorne. - That's obvious. - What? Ah. Forget it. I didn't say anything. Okay, okay, if I switch the ICU to 12-hour shifts, that will eliminate OT overages. It has to be personnel... Insurance, pension, side pay. Switch to per diems. No, they make my regulars work way too hard, trying to show them what to do. - I need a word. - It can't wait? Obviously not. Think about this. [ phone ringing ] (Marshall) I'm fed up. Okay... Your daughter on line 2. Camille, this better be good. No, it's a disaster. Justin is going to Virginia Beach this weekend. Who is Justin? A boy. But Emily is going, too. She's just gonna, like, throw herself at him. So, you think I should let you go instead so you can throw yourself at Justin? You're not going. This is important. No, it's not. You're ridiculous! No, no, no, no, no. You're ridiculous. Okay? Goodbye. Bye. Damn it! Dr. Marshall had a run-in with one of your nurses in the ER, one of the rookies... Nurse Epson? Kelly? She refuted Dr. Marshall's treatment of a patient. You mean she challenged her? You do know that nurses are allowed to do that. Wasn't nurse Epson the one that killed Mrs. Lachman? Mrs. Lachman died of a coronary. Mazaki's complained about her, too. - Really? - How could you tell? If she's that much trouble, you should consider cutting her. Not her. This hospital is... is dying. I'm trying to prune things back to help it recover, and the board's coming after it with a chain saw. And you... - Me what? - You're soft! You think you can make the hard decisions, but you can't. I need six nurses, and you can't get me one. Just one nurse to help this hospital survive. Kelly... I'm out of commission for a couple of hours and you decide to get under Dr. Marshall's skin? I knew it. I'm done. What the hell happened? I tried to call Bobbie, but she was in crisis mode. She told me to go directly to Dr. Marshall. I'm fired, aren't i? Why are you getting fired? She's not gonna get fired. Christina wouldn't let that happen. I called Dr. Marshall out on her mistake, and now she wants my head. Let me guess... you were right, and she was wrong Yes! Listen, just do your job. Stay out of her hair. Nobody gets fired. Oh, tell that to Dr. Weston. - Dr. Weston? - Mm-hmm. Tom just gave him the heave. Security had to drag him out. He couldn't even take his personal belongings. I should just pack up my stuff now. Thanks for the info. So, once again, Marshall screws up and lays the blame at the nurses' feet. How many times is she gonna get away with this? As many times as there are nurses to fire, I guess. Okay, you're not getting fired. Oh, I don't know. Marshall gets what Marshall wants, right? And now the layoffs have started. No. No. Enough is enough. There goes Norma Rae. I know you. Excuse me? Oh, I know exactly who you are. - (scoffs) Get out. - No. No, you're gonna listen to me, doctor. Because I know you. I know you're a fraud. - Get out! - No, you're a fraud who screws up because you're too arrogant to believe that other people, nurses, know as much as you do and, God forbid, even more. And then when you do screw up, you hang us out to dry. - You can't talk to me like that. - Oh, really? What are you gonna do? You gonna fire me? Go ahead. Try it. Try it, okay? Because then I will tell everybody what I know... Who you are. Oh, you're not so tough. (scoffs) You're not so tough, huh? You like it when someone calls you on your crap, don't you? - Yes! - Yeah? mmm. umm! mmm! That's nonsense. Kelly called Marshall out on missing something, and she was right. She can't get fired for that. Listen, Morrissey's not trying to be punitive, okay? Kelly just got on his radar. You're gonna back him down, right? You're actually considering it? This place is in a financial hole. Well, what else is new? What's new is that they plan on bringing a firm in here to run this whole hospital. That, they can afford. They'll run it into the ground, Bobbie. And you know with Sacred Heart just closed, there's no other hospital in our entire area. We're nurses. We'll always find jobs. Bobbie, i'm not worried about us. I'm worried about the people in this community. Where will they go? So, now you're saving the whole city? As much as I hate it, Morrissey's plan makes sense. To fire kelly? To just cut back a little bit more. You drank the kool-aid. It isn't right. So, you tell me what you would do, Bobbie. [ cell phone ringing ] Third time she's called. [ cell phone ringing ] How's your mother? She just got out of CT, so I'm taking Mrs. Mckinley up to see her. (Christina) What?! (Camille) Mom, you've got to listen to me. Camile, what is going on? I have to go to Virginia Beach. I'm the mother. You're the daughter. I tell you what you have to do. Oh, my God! Oh, no! Oh, no, my baby! I left her in the car! - You left her where? - Out there! Where's your car?! What car?! She's in the car! She's in the car! It's got to be 100 degrees in there. Get your keys! Bobbie! Nothing! Call a code! Ambu bag, Kelly! Got it. On my way. - Got it? - Yeah. (Maureen) Oh, my God. Oh, hold on one second, Maureen. Please save her! Please! - Got her? - Yeah Baby, please. - Got you. - Okay. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Give her oxygen. Baby, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! Move! Move! Go! Go! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (Christina) Code! Infant! - Page Pediatrics. - Right away. Let's go, people. (Christina) Okay, on my count. Ready? 1, 2, 3, lift. Give a round of epi. We need to intubate. Let's bag her. Kelly! Epi coming up. Tom, she was in the car. How long? I don't know. - Where's the mother? - Right there. How long was she in the car? I don't know... a long time. Um, I brought my mother in. (Bobbie) She was seizing. 45 minutes, maybe an hour. It's 95 degrees outside. It had to be 120 in that car. Let's bring her core temperature down. - Candy, get some ice. - Okay. - Clear that bay! - Right away, sir. - Any pulse? - None. Resume CPR. No defib. She's hyperthermic. Another round of epi. Okay, switch. (Maureen) I'm sorry! (Dr. Marshall) Nothing. (Tom) Give one more round of epi. Bobbie, check the pulse. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Time of death... What? Call it... 14:02. [ flips tray, crashing ] What did he say? Time of death, 14:02. What? What? Why are you stopping? No, no! Please save her! Please save her! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God! (crying) Kelly... Oh (crying) Oh, my God! no! Please, no! Where can we find Christina Hawthorne's office? Thank you. (sobbing) We need to talk to her. Just give me a minute, please. (sobbing continues) [ door closes ] That's it. Hey. Hey. I hear it was brutal. Yeah, I've never seen anything like it. Everyone was just, um... It was so bad that Wakefield couldn't call time of death. You want to talk about it? What's there to talk about, Ray? You know, it's just another tragedy in a job full of awful tragedies. You know, it's what we signed up for. Actually, none of us signed up for this. All right? Did you talk to Marshall? I saw her, yeah. And? I tried. I- I actually don't know what happened. (sighs) (Larry) Ray? Thanks for saving my life. You're welcome. But if you had to save anyone, I wish it'd been that baby. That's sweet. Truth is, the kid's better off. Excuse me? It's her own fault. She left her kid in a car on a hot day. What kind of idiot does that? What kind of idiot says that? Oh, come on. I'm just saying what everyone else is thinking. Okay, that woman was scared out of her mind. Boo-hoo. It's survival of the fittest. Give her the Darwin Award. You know what, Larry? That woman has to live with herself for the rest of her life, and you're making it a stand-up routine. You're mean. Get out of my ER... now! uh? Unbelievable. I should not have done that. Oh, I'm so glad you did. How you doin'? Our hospital's a crime scene. I know. It's a mess. I hate this place. [ police radio chatter ] I hate this place. I think we all do today. It's changing. It's changing... What Morrissey's doing and acting like he's our savior. I heard about Weston. Yeah. I ended his 30-year career, his life's work, with a pathetic handshake. And then I watched a 3-month-old baby fry. I'm supposed to come back tomorrow and do it all over again smile and hand out lollipops and pretend like what we do makes a difference? We do make a difference. Do we? Your own husband died here. All the tests, all the operations, you, me, for what? Tom, we did everything we could for Michael and that baby. My point exactly. Can I speak with you? Sure. Um... someone will be with you shortly. Okay. I heard you cursed out Larry. Yeah, he was being a douche bag. Did you hear what he said? It doesn't matter. He was a patient. It sounds as if you were being unprofessional. Unprofessional? Well... What's that about the pot and the kettle? Excuse me? You know, uh... (sighs) Never mind. You're being queen bee today, and I don't want to get written up. What the hell does that mean? You were right there. You were right by the car. You think that was my fault? I was helping the mother. She was seizing. You haven't been back to see how any of us are holding up afterward. Do you even know where Kelly is? (Kelly sobbing) Kelly... We've all been through hell. Come on out and we'll talk it out. (Kelly sobbing) Kelly... -Go in. - Okay. [ door opens ] (Kelly sobbing) I can't do this anymore. It's too hard. It's so... hard. I think I need to quit... find something else. We'll talk about it. Why don't you have a seat? I'm glad you're doing this. I'm not doing this. You are. What do you mean? You need to tell them something. Tell them it's gonna be okay. That's your job. You had the house today, Bobbie. You got to do it. And... and say what? Something inspirational. I can't. You have to. That baby died on my watch. Okay, listen to me. All right? I know this is really hard. I need you to get out there in front of these people with ice-cold water in your veins, Bobbie, and you need to tell them something... so that they can get back out there and do what they need to do. I can't. I really can't. All right. Thank you, all of you, for coming down here today. I know this has been a hard one. This has been a really, really hard day. We lost. (sighs) It's just that simple. And this one hurt. It hurt bad. And usually I would be the one to say something to pull us through this, but it's not my place, so I'm not. Bobbie? We all know what happened today, and we all know it sucked. And... we just have to deal with it... because we have other patients to help. And... we all know what I'm supposed to say... that we make a difference, that even though one... innocent... died today, think of all the people we did help. That we... we hold hands... and all this other BS I am pissed. I am angry. I am mad at that lady for what she did to her kid. And I am mad at God for making it so hot, and I am really mad at myself for not turning my head and seeing that baby in the car. Bobbie... No. Let me be pissed. Let us all be pissed that patients just thank the doctors and the doctors just ignore us or talk down to us or try to get us fired or slap our ass. Let us be pissed because we can't save every one and that is all we want... every damn one. I heard about the tragedy in the ER. I talked to the police. They assured me that we wouldn't be held liable. No real personnel cuts. You're signing a death warrant here, you know. They're gonna come in and do it anyway. You have, uh, no idea what the... You have no idea what this place has been through today, so maybe we could... This is a hospital. People die. That doesn't mean we stop doing our jobs. True, but my staff's been through enough. What about this Kelly Epson? Not her. Bobbie Jackson? With her seniority, you can save two staff positions. Definitely not her. Who, then? - Morrissey. - Who? I'll resign. I need a CNO. I don't need a martyr. Kelly Epson has to go. You can't fire her. I will fire her myself. You can't. (chuckles) Of course I can. Morrissey, please. Don't make me fire... (crying) Anyone today, please. Not today. How about if I cut their cost-of-living increase for the year? That could buy us some time. Would they go for that, you think? Okay. Thank you.
