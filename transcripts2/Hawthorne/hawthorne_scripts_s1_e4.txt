Well, she is yourgranddaughter. You can see her whenever you want. Just that I spent so much time with her last year... It's different. Is she free this weekend? Perhaps she can com by on Saturday after she gets back from the trip. What trip? The trip to Washington... The class trip. She ain't going on no trip. She's grounded. She's what? She's grounded, meaning she ain't going nowhere. One, two, three. Here's the I.D. MVA, semiconscious, pressure's 90 over 40. Ji Sun Kim. Ji Sun? Ji Sun, squeeze my hand if you can hear me.

Is it okay if I look you over and make sure you're okay? Got a couple of scrapes and bruises. Is it all right if I take you to see some doctors and make sure you're all right? Okay. Transcripted on addi7ed 1x04 "All the Wrong Place" Is this today's bloodwork for David Gendler? I drew it myself. His results are good, right? Yeah, very good... for a guy who threw himself off a building. For a man with stage-four lymphoma, impossible. Hey, David. Oh, hey, doc. How you doing? I think I'm ready for my figure-skating lessons. Hey, you stuck me already... this morning, remember? How you been sleeping? As good as I've been able to. How about food? You eating well? Fine. Really? In this place? Last week's ravioli is still killing me. Is anything wrong? No, nothing. Nothing at all. You get some rest, okay? Thank you. So you do speak English. What's your name? Sang. Now, that's a cool name. Sang, I really need to talk to your dad. I don't have one. Do you have any aunts and uncles, grandparents? I'll notify social work. Oh, no, don't worry about it. I got it. You must be really scared, huh? I left my mitt. Well, I'm sure we can get you a new one. We were going back to get it. Mom was so mad. She said I never take care of my things. Well, you know what? We moms tend to get mad sometimes. I told her she was stupid. She looked at me. I guess she didn't see that... car. It wasn't your fault. Is she going to die? No. Not on my watch. Excuse us. Vernice? Vernice? Oh. Sorry to bother you, but where do you keep the gelfoam? Dr. Smith needs it for Harrison in 216. Gelfoam? We never use that. Got to go to general stores for that. I'll get it. Oh, no, you're eating. Finish. Just tell me where to go. The basement. You know where housekeeping is? No. When you get off the elevators, make your second right. Past housekeeping, there's a double door. That's clinical engineering. You pass that to the right, you make a left. Got it. Thank you. Hi. I'm Bobbie. Lucy. You have a urinary tract infection. Yeah. I get them. And you've seen a gynecologist? Uh, I don't have insurance. That's why I come to the E.R. Sorry. We'll get you fixed up. I just need cipro instead of amoxicillin. That's a pretty specific request. Like I said, I've gotten them before. I'll just get a doctor to come in and see you. He's gonna want to ask you some questions. Sure. This is strange. It looks like Miss Kim only has a mild splenic laceration. Last report, her vitals were improving, but the surgical team's on deck anyway. Dr. Richardson mentioned a little boy whose mother is critical. Yeah, he's doing fine. I had the police run her info. Looks like he's on his own. So, what do we do? Even if mom does recover, she could be here for weeks. I have no choice but to find a foster family. Madeline, come on. We see kids come through here all the time that have been placed in foster care. It's not our call. Well, it ain't gonna happen. I'm calling Child Services. Okay. Go ahead. But he's not ready to go yet. He's still being treated medically. I thought you said he was fine. We're still running tests. You can never be, uh, too careful. How much longer? I don't know. What do you think, Bobbie? Could be a while. Could be... yeah. Quite a while. I'll be back later. I know those tubes seem really scary... but they're helpful. So, you got to trust me. They're really gonna help her, okay? Okay. All right. Ji Sun. I'm sitting here with your precious son. And I want you to know he's okay. He's not hurt at all. But he has a few things he wants to say to you. You mean tell her that I'm sorry? You can tell her whatever you want. Mom... I'm sorry. It was my fault. Hey, Bobbie? The boy's okay? He is... a few scratches. Child Services on their way? No, he's actually gonna stay with me. Of course he is. I heard they needed the jaws of life to rescue the mother. That delayed treatment. M.R.I. show anything? Well, the E.R. resident said he wanted her vitals stable first. Kids these days... way too cautious. What, you were a cowboy? Well, I wouldn't go that far. She could be bleeding out. Do you want a CT scan of her abdomen? No, not with those numbers. She's too unstable. Call the blood bank... 4 units of packed RBC to the neuro ICU. We'll transfuse there. Let's go. On the move! Mom! John Garrett. Child Protective Services. Mm. Hi. I'm Christina Hawthorne. I was gonna call you. I understand the woman's son has no other guardian. Yes, it looks that way. We have a very responsible couple that can help. They often take children whose parents have been in accidents or arrested. Got it. Um, how many kids do they have now? Five, maybe six. Which is it...? Five or six? I'd have to check my records. Okay, you do that. And then, if it's five, just let me know where the sixth one went. Is there a problem here? Listen, I know you mean well, but there's no way I'm gonna have this woman wake up and I tell her that her son's been placed in a home with five or maybe six kids. If you're holding that boy without medical reason, I'll have to call the police. Okay, you can do that. Hawthorne... they know me. You know what I heard? What? Now, this is one of those, "I know a guy who knows a guy whose cousin... " Yeah, yeah. All right, some joker just got back from Iraq, says there's a nurse here. Maybe she was a massage therapist. She's all about the happy endings. Get out! That's what I heard, man... Hooked the brother right up. You think it's true? Well, crazy rumor... Sure. But it's like I say... Where's there's smoke, there's got to be some fire! That's right. Some fire, baby! David Gendler's lymph nodes looked normal... not overtly swollen at all. And his white blood cell differential was unremarkable. I reset the pin in his artificial hip and biopsied one of his lymph glands. It was negative. No cancer? So, w... what are we saying, that it's just... just all gone? We're talking about Hodgkin's lymphoma, Tom. It's not like we're saying a... a huge mass magically disappeared. The guy attempted suicide, and then he beats the odds? I mean, i... is it possible that his lymphoma went into remission so his body could heal? Stranger things have happened. We must be missing something. If you want to be a nonbeliever, feel free. I need to be sure. Unless there's a medical reason for him to be here, I'm ready to transfer to an ortho rehab facility. Right now, just let him live his life. I'm ordering another M.R.I. Face it, Tom. You cured David Gendler. Congratulations. No transfer. Excuse us. Watch your back. Oh! I'm sorry. Hey. Hey. Who's your wingman? Oh, this is Sang. He's riding shotgun with me today. What's up, little man? All right! I, uh, talked to your occupational therapist. She says you're doing very well. She tell you she measured me for a casket? Why you playin'? No, it's all right. I mean, you'll give me a nice eulogy. Just please do not let my brother speak. Did Tom say something? He didn't have to. Your vitals look good. So do you. Well, then why am I a human pincushion? I'm gonna get somebody in here to take care of that, okay? I'm gonna go find Tom. Come on, Sang. Lucy? What are you doing? Drawing some blood. What for? Standard procedure. You said you haven't been to a doctor in a while. Can't hurt. Your veins are kind of thin. Can I see the other one? They always take from this one. Can I see for myself? Let me take a look at your arm, please. Let me take a look. Motorcycle accident. I've done everything I was supposed to do... Six surgeries... Rehab. It just keeps getting worse. Please don't let them take my arm. I'm sorry. Um, excuse me. Are you general stores? I ain't general stores. This... is general stores. I'm Big Tiny. I'm in charge of lubes, tubes, even silicone boobs. Malibu! Go deep! Yeah! Whoo! What floor you from? 2 west. Vernice made you come all the way down here by yourself? Oh, no, I volunteered. I need some gelfoam. One sponge or two? Oh. That would've been a good question to ask the doctor, wouldn't it? Uh, you better take the whole box, then. Not a high-turnover item. Last time one of those got used... October 24th. That's my birthday. Happy birthday. Yeah. Hey, you know your way out of here? Go back the way you came, second right, first left, then a hard left, then another right. Got it. All right. Thanks. Yeah, can you page Tom Wakefield to my phone? Thanks. All right, bye. All right, that's for you, since you did such a good job with your lunch. You said my mom would be okay. She's not okay. She's got all these tubes and machines. Have you ever heard of the international mommies club? No?! We have, like, secret meetings. We even have a secret handshake. And we made an agreement. If a mom gets hurt, then another mom comes in to fill in for her. So, right now, you're under the protection of the international mommies club. And I'm gonna step in and take care of you until mommy gets better. There's no international moms club. What are you talking about? Christina. Hi, mom. Hey. How you guys doing Good. Well, who's this? This is Sang. His mom is in the ICU. Oh, poor thing. We just made an agreement that I'll be his mom until she gets better. You're kidding, right? No. So, you'll do this, but you won't let me go to Washington? What is this about you canceling the class trip? Can we talk about this later? When? It's this weekend. Well, she's not going. Don't be shortsighted, dear. Yes, she broke curfew, but you can punish her some other way. A class trip to Washington with a black president may never happen again. You know, and Michael really never would... Amanda, Michael is dead. And Michael would have never second-guessed me. You sure? He would have let me go. Mom, fine, I stayed out too late. I'm sorry. But not this. Sang. Sang! Sang! Sang! Code blue! Look out! Got it? Here. Give me the oxygen. Okay. All right, let's get him on a gurney. On my count... One, two, three, lift. All right. All right, get another amp of epi. All right, let's move. What happened? Well, he was having ice cream, and he just... he collapsed. Could have suffered some neuro damage in the accident. You send him for a CT? I was there when he got evaluated. He checked out. How's his mom? We just ordered two more units of whole blood, but if she bottoms out again, she's going to the O.R. Hey, Tom. I saw David's chart. Oh, yeah? So, you saw he looks fully recovered. Then why are you probing him like a UFO? Have you ever seen such a grave case like his go into full remission? He's scared to death. He thinks you're hiding something from him. Well, you know, I've jumped the gun before... delivered good news that turned out to be wrong. If I make that mistake here... Okay, well, Howard wants to transfer him. I told Howard he's staying. Stop using him as a case study. All right? He's already been through hell. We're talking about a guy who threw himself off the roof to end his suffering. Are you telling me he can't handle a few more blood draws? It's a miracle. You did your job. Be happy! Yeah, and a few hours ago, you gave that little boy in there a clean bill of health, didn't you? Coming through. Put in for an ortho-surgery consult. That kid in treatment two... She needs her amputation tonight. She's taking it kind of hard, so you may want to check in on her. I will. She doesn't want amputation. She wants hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement. Well, she's been through all that already. I mean, what choice does she have? We'd end up just amputating at the end of the month anyway. It's her choice. She wants the treatment. Amputation is treatment. That arm's already gone. You should call for a vascular consult. That won't stop the infection from moving into the bone. It's what she wants. It'll kill her! Are you sure this is about her? That's way out of line. I'm sorry. How about that vascular consult? Page me when ortho gets here. Christian... Lucy Myers in treatment two needs a vascular consult. Her doctor just asked me to call it in. Hello? Anybody here? Hello. Oh, God, Mr. Fleming, you scared me! Oh, my God, you scared me. Oh, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? Mommy! Wait! No, Mr. Fleming, wait! Stop! Where are you going? Mr. Fleming! I didn't mean to scare you. Okay. Mommy. Hey. Where you going now? Another scan. I have to drink that nuclear milkshake again. I'm gonna be up all night vomitin Can you give us a second? Thank you. Tom didn't stop by? I probably shouldn't be the one to tell you this, but... Oh, no! David, David, David. I'm so sorry. It's not that. I'm sorry. Your cancer is in full remission. W... what? Your... lymphoma is gone. It's gone. But what about all these tests It's a miracle, we can't explain it, and that just doesn't fly by our boy Tom. I'm healthy. Yes, you are. And this place is for sick people, so we got to get you out of here. But what about Tom? I mean, he's the reason why I'm here. He's... he's keeping me here. Well, you know, it's a funny thing about that. Listen... The guards... they change their shift at midnight. All I need for you to do is tie your sheets together, throw them out the window, climb down, and I'll have the laundry truck waiting for you outside. I'm really gonna live, Christina? Yes, you are. And I'm gonna get you out of here so you can start. So, I'll have you admitted upstairs, and we'll begin that treatment once you get all settled. Thank you, doctor. What's going on? I just completed my evaluation. I'll have Miss Myers admitted to my service. Who called you for a vascular consult? My office got a call from the ER. Something wrong? I told you I don't want amputation. And I don't want that spreading to the rest of your body. Call the number at the bottom, all right? Thanks. Take care of yourself. Later, brother. Later. Hey, let me ask you something. Is there any truth to that rumor that I heard? What rumor? You know, the one that there's a nurse around here who's very hands-on with the patients. I'm not really sure what you mean. I've got a great health plan. I'd forget about it. I mean, if it's true, maybe she and a friend will double-team me. Good luck with that. Christina, got a minute? Bobbie, you too. Someone called in a phony request for a consult. They lied and said it came from my attending. The patient is adamant she doesn't want that treatment. She need a second opinion to explore other options. You know she doesn't have any. Only physicians order consults. Well, nurses are patient advocates. Yeah, this case is difficult enough. She's confusing the issue. Only patients are allowed to ask for second opinions, not nurses. Let's go talk to this girl. Are you kidding me? After I helped you give the social worker the run around this morning? Way to get my back. Come on, Bobbie. That was a totally different situation. That was a child. And I'm helping my patient. Well, then help. Help her make this decision. I mean, you can reach her. You can show her...I'm the poster child for amputees? You know more than anybody here what she needs. She needs to fight for that arm, to have someone fight for it with her, not let that jerk perform some quick cut that leaves her less than whole. He's doing his job. And I need you to do your job. Now, you can fight for her arm, or you can fight for her. It's the same thing, Christina. Bobbie, you know that is not true. That girl needs that amputation. Now, you can help her accept that. Are you willing to do that? Fine. I'll find somebody who is. I know you don't want to lose your arm, dear, but prosthetics these days are wonderful. I'm left-handed. How will I write? Sign my name? You know, my grandfather was left-handed at a time when it was considered bad form to be left-handed, and his teachers taught him to write with his right hand. You can learn, too. What about getting dressed, tying my shoes?! Honey, I know you're overwhelmed right now, but believe me, God doesn't give you more than you can handle. Bullshit. God pours it on for sport. Don't come in here and give me some "tomorrow is the first day of the rest of your life" nonsense. This is my arm... My arm! Why don't you understand?! I was explaining to Ms. Myers how important it is that she not delay her surgery. Yeah, I get it. Let us have a minute. Of course. Good luck, dear. She means well. But she doesn't get it. But I do. My brothers and I... when we were kids, we were cutting through a vacant lot. My leg got snagged on a fence. The gash never healed. Looked worse than your arm. Finally... I can't tell you it'll be okay. I can't tell you you won't wake up in the middle of the night with your arm throbbing even though it's not there. I can't tell you little kids won't stare or that men won't look at you differently. It sucks. It's hard. But it won't kill you. But believe me... delaying your surgery will. I'm sorry. I can't be like like that, like you. I can't be... a freak. Be strong. All right, so this is what your great health plan gets you...private room. You know, I can't stop thinking about that rumor. Yeah, yeah. I, uh... I said forget about it. Doesn't add up. Unless... it's not a woman. I'm not... I don't follow. Excuse me? Got to be a guy! Come on, buddy. Hook me up. Thanks. I've been at this job two months now, and I seem to get worse every day. And now I can't find my way out of here... with a patient, to boot. Oh, my. My dad wanted me to be a dentist. Imagine that? I knew I couldn't handle it, so... I settled for nursing school. "Settled"? This stuff is hard. I mean, sometimes, when the patient's in pain and their dose is maxed out, the doctor's yelling, and the nurses are looking at me like I'mthe one they should be worried about... ... sometimes I just want to hide. I guess that's what we're doing... hiding. Mr. Fleming, I promise I'm gonna find a way out of here. Okay? Mr. Fleming? No! Stop! Mr. Fleming! Stop! No! No! Mm! Hold it, hold it. Where's he going? O.r. For exploratory. Mom's on the table, too. You guys are shooting in the dark. Out of the way. Okay, hold it, hold it, hold it. 20 questions. Just indulge me, okay? He came in from a car accident with abrasions. Could that be the symptom of something? no. Okay. All right, all right. He was talking to his mother on a stool, started to stutter, spoke korean, fell off. Could that mean something? Intracranial bleeding. You would've checked for that. What else? Spinal-cord injury. You would've seen that, too. What about the mom? She's not my patient. I know she's not your patient. But she's not moving, either, okay? What is that thing that can paralyze two people and leave no trace? I don't know. What could paralyze two people and leave no trace?! Mr. Fleming? There you are! You know, running around the hospital is only gonna make your pneumonia worse. I found him in the basement. Where? By general stores. General stores is nowhere near here. Better get him back to his room. Uh, yeah. Come on. You're okay. Thank you for finding me. You mean to tell me all we have to do is start a drip? Slow push -- if you pump too fast, it could stop her heart. Hypokalemic periodic paralysis. Pretty rare disorder -- affects asians, eastern europeans. Stress of the accident made their potassium levels drop, and low potassium causes paralysis. You're the bomb. Thank you, karen! hey! Is there a kim in o.r.? Yeah. Okay, just stop it! tom! Tom, stop! Don't operate. Hell are you talking about? Her son's potassium crashed. I'll fix that post-op. But why? We've got her on a drip. We just put her under. I can't wait. Tom, just trust me! Why? 'cause you always know better? What is that supposed to mean? It means david gendler's refusing treatment 'cause you told him to. He's cured. You said that yourself. You're interfering! You called out your own nurse on that. David and this woman -- They're not guinea pigs. And you're not a doctor. Ray, slow i.v. Push -- Potassium chloride. Please don't tell me my patient died. He went home. Turns out we had two cases of this in the storage room. Oh, child, don't tell me you've been gone all this time. Thanks for noticing. All right. I wanted to bring us all here so that we could get a few things clear. Okay? Amanda, you're grandma. And you know what grandmas do? They give money for gifts, they call her "sweetie," and smell like easter. That's what grandmothers do. Are you scolding me? You -- Well, you're the daughter. And you know what daughters do? They live in my house, follow my rules, and then they text their friends and talk about how much they hate me. That's what daughters do. And then there's me. I'm the mother. I make the rules. So, here's a rule for you. You're not going to d.c. mom. You want to know why? Because there is no trip to d.c. I called your school. You lied. there is no trip? You made this all up, and you lied to us? Would you like to tell us where you were planning on going? Uh, new york? With suzanne? This is really terrible. How could you do this to me? Camille, your freedom is mine forever. What does that mean? It means that you're in the doghouse until I say you're not. Not only did you lie about this whole thing, you brought your grandmother into this?! That's gonna cost you. That's gonna cost you. That's gonna cost you. I'm sorry, grandma. So am i. Don't you go far. I'm not done with you. Do you see what I'm dealing with? Okay? I can't do this by myself, amanda. I do not smell like easter. What?! Yeah, and if they know, who else knows? Okay, but he said it was a rumor,right? What difference does that make? Well, he didn't mention my name? no. All right, then I don't think there's a problem. Candy, as your friend, I'm telling you to stop it, okay? Stop going above and beyond for every tom, dick, or harry who comes in here and says he spent his weekend at the national guard. Okay, first of all, the national guard is just as much heroes as anybody else in the armed forces, okay? They're going to iraq just like everybody else. They're dropped in a sandstorm. It's 120-degree heat. They don't speak the language. They are strangers in a strange land. And god forbid they get hurt. They come back here, and they need a little extra tlc. I don't know what's the problem with me giving them some. Give them ice chips. Or play cards with them if you have to, candy, but -- but, come on, the whole thing -- It's -- it's a little bit out there, don't you think? You make it sound so... dirty. Shame on you. Uh, candy, just -- Just listen, please? Can you just --Just think this through. Maybe it's your calling, okay? That's good. But if these guys heard about it, other people will. Christina will. And then your whole career will be at risk, then you can't help anybody. All right? You're right. Thanks. Okay, good. Oh, you're so -- You're so very welcome. And, hey, if, uh, you ever get that urge...I'm here, okay? You're disgusting! No, to talk! I meant to talk. Lucy. Give us a minute? I was gonna let you go up to vascular without saying anything else, but I can't. I know you think i'm a freak. I'm sorry about that. And maybe I am, but not for the obvious reason. Truth is, I'm a freak because I don't miss my leg. And given a chance, i'm not sure I'd have it back if I could. What do you mean? I do what I do here because i lost my leg, because I understand what my patients go through. So, in a weird way, in a weird way, And you -- you can hang on to that arm out of fear, to that arm out of fear, your bones -- and it will -- You could die. Let it go. Live the life you're supposed to. Good luck. there she is, just like I promised. So, you guys will stay here and recover from the car crash, and then you'll go home. Thank you! You're welcome! And remember, I still owe you that mitt. You were right. And I hate it when you're right. Well, you know, that makes two... ...and everything. You know, with david. I- I know. I know. I know. His, uh -- his cancer going into remission's a real miracle. And I am transferring him to a rehab center first thing in the morning. Nice. We'll call it a lucky break, especially with this one. No, that's not luck. That was all you. Oh, no, no, no, no. You made the call. You twisted my arm. You're not always gonna be right, you know. You sure about that, dr. Wakefield?
