 And you can use my desk. This sucks. And I've got plenty of pens and paper. This is so unfair! Oh, I gotta go. Thanks. And you can even close the blinds. Totally blows. All right, Camille. I am really trying this newfangled parenting thing, but I know the old way. All right? So you choose. Um, I need to talk to you. Hey, Camille, what's up?

 I'm a prisoner. Camille is flunking English... Which surprises me, considering English is the language that she speaks. Hmm. Shakespeare is not English. "if we spirits have offended..." Who talks like that, anyway? The real reason I got an "f" on my essay is because my teacher is a fascist. Oh, no, the reason why you got an "f" on your essay is because you wrote it in the form of a rap. It was a good rap. Oh, it was a great rap but, also, not an essay. So, from henceforth, thou shall remain here until the assignment is done properly.

 I want a social worker. And I want a cranberry and vodka. But that's not gonna happen, either. Yes, Dr. Wakefield? What's with you today? Well, let's see. I learned that I maxed out my credit card, I can't change a tire, and my daughter is flunking the 10th grade. So I've decided you take on a bad day with a good attitude. Well, let me know how that works out for you. Okay. In the meantime, neuro has a guy that they just thrombolysed intra-arterially. Did they catch it in time? Well, they're not sure. But they need to set up a bed for him in the i.c.u. As soon as he's out of recovery. I.C.U. is jam-packed. So they tell me. Can you bump somebody? I am meeting Eddie Ramos in 20 minutes to discontinue his mother's life support. You think he'll actually show today? Maybe. Want me to walk with you? Would you? Yeah. You know what? You might make somebody a good husband someday. Good seeing you, camille. Yeah. You too. Hey, mom! Work! And o.r.'s not giving out extras anymore, so the main thing is to bring your own backup scrubs in case you get bled on, puked on, or urinated on. Great. Uh, question Am I really gonna get urinated on? Um, last week, I got all three in the same shift. All from the same patient, actually... Mike. Nice guy once he sobered up. Oh! Kelly, here's the thing. I think you're a sweetheart, but I don't need "sweet" in the E.R. I need "pit bull." I know it's only your second shift here, but do you think you can do that? Can you give me "pit bull"? I can. Absolutely. Good. Somebody?! Help?! Please?! Kelly, you're on. Okay. Somebody... there is something wrong with my baby! Oh, okay, what happened? I... I don't know. She just started shaking, and then she went limp. Okay, sounds like a seizure. Okay. Bobbie, she's altered! Oh! I... I need an I.V., and, um, an O2 monitor... And a blow-by oxygen. And can we get a resident in here, please? Hey! Hi! Oh, hi! Hi. It's so funny, I just happened to be on the floor. The guy had to get over to the... you know, all the orderlies are on break, and someone has to You know, I am a people person. So why would you lock me alone all shift in this drug closet so I can check expiration dates? They locked you alone here... The whole shift? Yeah. God, it's so, uh... It's dark and warm. It's cozy. You know what? I should probably get back to it... 'cause it's gonna take me the entire shift. I'll tell you what I got a piece-of-cake shift, so I'll just come back here on breaks. I'll help you check the dates and, uh, keep you from dying of boredom. Oh, really, Ray? Yeah! Thank you. No problem. That'd be great. All right. I'll see you soon. Okay. Okay, well, where is he? No, I... I understand. I... Will you j... I need you to find him and tell him he needs to call me as soon as possible, okay? Thank you. Dr. Smith is M.I.A. I'll cover for him. What time are you supposed to meet Eddie? Looks like he's standing me up again. I don't know. He's having a really hard time with this. You think there's somebody else we could bump? There is no one else. Appendectomy needs another three hours. Motorcycle vs. Bus needs another three days. Slip and fall is still unstable. The head trauma could be here for who knows how long. She's been on life support for 10 weeks. She can't stay in the i.c.u. Forever. I know, but what can I say? You know... he's getting there. Well, he better get there quick. What are we supposed to do with the neuro patient? Hello? Eddie. O... Okay, hold on. It's eddie. He's downstairs in the parking lot. You think you could come with me and just give him some of that magical medical lingo of yours? I'll see what I can do. Okay. Eddie? Is she okay? She's fine. She's settling down. Kids have seizures, right? I mean, I've heard that. Febrile seizures are relatively common, but her temperature is 98. What does that mean? Is it possible she ingested something? A medication, household cleaner? What? No. Absolutely not. Hi, I'm Dr. Fields. Hi. What have we got? She seized just before arrival. Her pulse and temp are normal, and the mother doesn't think she ingested anything. Okay, do a full blood work-up, get a cath-ua, and prep her for a spinal tap. Hang tight, we're gonna rule out some things first. Anything else for me? Yeah, compound fracture. Trauma 4. Rule out what kinds of things? What does she need a spinal tap for? Oh, it's just a precaution. It's important to rule out meningitis. She seems like she's doing much better. Maybe I should just take her home. Mary, you have to let us do our job, okay? We need to find out what happened. Hello! Mrs. Kramer. Dolores. Well, I'm Ray. And I'll be your floor nurse for the next 12 hours. So, what on earth were you doing extreme biking? Trying to stay in shape. Ever heard of yoga? Pilates? Dolores, are you an adrenaline junkie? Oh, no. My son darren thinks I'm crazy. Darren hates sports. Oh. He's a musician. His idea of a workout is a short walk across the room to pick up his bong. He sounds like a talented guy. Well, he's coming to visit this afternoon. You know, you kind of remind me of him. Well, he sounds like a talented and wildly attractive guy. Now, dolores, is there anything at all that you need? Well, there is one thing. Oh, lay it on me. What is it? Uh, pain meds, dressing reworked, I.V. changed... anything. No, no, all that's fine. The problem is, m... my ice water isn't very icy. But I... I don't want to hold you up if you have somewhere else to be. No. No. No, of course not. You're my number-one priority, Dolores. Ice water it is. I'm sorry. I...can't go in there. I just can't do it. Eddie... I know I'm supposed to do it. I'm her son. She trusts me. I... I just can't understand how I'm supposed to just.. End it. Uh, Mr. Ramos, I'm... I'm Dr. Wakefield. I'm filling in for Dr. Smith. I can't imagine how difficult this must be for you. But I... I just wanted to make sure that you understood that when there's no more brain-wave activity, there's no chance for recovery. I know, I know. But she's still alive. Eddie, we've been through this a million times. Why don't you just come in, and we can walk you through it? No. I... Ican't go in there. I know this is very hard. So if you want, we could handle it for you. No. No, t... that wouldn't work. She wants me to be the one to do it. And I couldn't live with myself if I didn't say goodbye. Mr. Ramos, there are other options. You know, there are facilities that specialize in caring for people like your mother. No. Look, I... I just need a little bit more time. Tomorrow. Just give me till tomorrow, please 24 hours. Okay? Thank you. Thank you so much. All right? It's okay. Thank you, Christina. Thank you, doctor. Christina, you are making promises you have neither the ability or the authority to keep. If I can't promise a man. 24 hours to say goodbye to his mother, then what's the point? So what's your plan? I plan on finding her a bed. Where? Well, that I don't know. Well, whatever you're gonna do, you better do it quick I need that I.C.U. bed for someone we can save. Ah, well, thanks for that pep talk, Tom. Are you sure? We don't have anything.. You're positive? positive. Most of the units started laughing before I even got the whole request out, which was fun for me. This is ridiculous, because I know we have a place that we can... ...put her. What? Are you reading my aura? Is it purple? Bingo. Cardio tech to room 322. So it's not meningitis. Oh, thank God. So, w... what is it? Do you keep rubbing alcohol in your house? Y... yeah, I guess. Probably. Why? Well, rubbing alcohol has an ingredient called isopropanol. And trace amounts of it were found in her urine, so we think that's what caused the seizure. I don't understand. H... how did iso... whatever get into her urine? Well, she probably ingested it a couple hours prior to getting to the E.R. Whoa, wait a second. You're saying my kid drank rubbing alcohol? That's not possible. Mrs. Barth, I know it can be difficult keeping an eye on a baby every minute. Anything can happen. Sometimes, when left unsupervised ... She's never left unsupervised. Well, maybe your husband or a babysitter... No, it's just me. And she's never left unsupervised. And even if she was, it's not like I keep rubbing alcohol in her crib. Ifi have any, it's in a... a medicine cabinet. You think she climbed up, opened a medicine cabinet, took the top off a bottle, and took a swig? She's a baby... There's no way! You need to run that test again. Okay. We'll keep you posted. Kelly? So, should I call the lab and ask them to run the test again? The test isn't wrong. The lab double- checked it the first time. But, I mean, how could this have happened? She's right, the baby's way too young to drink the rubbing alcohol on her own. I agree. Which makes you wonder if maybe someone fed it to her. On purpose? Wait, you think the mother... I don't know, but we have to consider the possibility. She's a single mom, she's all on her own, she seems pretty overwhelmed. Well, she's upset about her daughter! No, Bobbie, I... I don't believe it. There's no way a mother could ever do that to her child. I thought that, too, and then I spent the last seven years working in an emergency room. I should put in a call to social services in here, just in case. You keep an eye on the mom, I'll make the call. Kelly? "Pit bull" remember? Dr. Walner to oncology. Dr. Walner to oncology. Yeah. I got it. You need something else, Dolores? I hate to bother you, but I was really hoping to watch a movie with my son when he gets here. He loves movies, especially ones with Jack Black and... and Robin Williams, but you know who he really loves? I do not. Jim Carrey! Oh! Don't we all? Anyway, I... I can't figure out how to make the pay-per-view work. Well, that... that might be, Dolores, 'cause there is no pay-per-view. But how do we watch movies? You could try one of the movie channels. I'm gonna help you with that. Here we go. Just click that. Here you go. Hmm? We want action. Yeah, there you go. See? Good. Oh, wow, would you look at that? Giddyup. Do you think they're gonna be showing any Jim Carrey movies? I have absolutely no idea, Dolores. But, you know, if... if I had to put my money on it, I'd say "yeah." Yeah. Oh. Ray! Yeah, I'll just be one minute, okay? Candy! Oh. Yeah? Where you going? Oh! That closet is like a sauna. I'm gonna go change into something... lighter! Ah! I am so sweaty. Really? Yeah. Are you? Are you coming? Ray! Yeah? Five minutes! What? I will be there. Yeah, I'll... I'll definitely be there. Okay. Good. Oh. Bye, Ray! Bye. I need a crash cart, fully stocked, okay? So try 5 east. Also, call respiratory. Tell them I need a ventilator and portable o2. And make sure she comes in here with all her meds. Got it. Okay, good. Okay! This is very important! I need one of you to go down to the cafeteria. Ask for Manny. Tell Manny that Christina said make a heaping plate of fettuccine. Take that fettuccine down to electric. Give it to my boys 'cause they hooked me up with these power cables, okay? Fettuccine? The cafeteria's serving tex-mex today. Just tell Manny what I said and that I owe him one, okay? Fettuccine coming up. Thank you. Okay, ladies. Let's make it! Dr. Kurtz, 2611. Dr. Kurtz, 2611. Oh, sick. Dr. North to the cath lab. Dr. North to the cath lab. Sorry. I have a lock on my toilet. I'm sorry? I have a lock... on my toilet? How crazy is that? I mean, really, how many kids drown in toilets every year? I... I don't know. Me neither. It can't be many, though. But I have a lock... Just in case. I have... carbon-monoxide alarms. I have furniture bolted to the walls. I don't even let the poor kid have a blanket in her crib, just to make sure she doesn't suffocate. I clean her head to toe, sometimes a couple times a day, just to protect her from germs. It must be hard, you know, being a mom. It's only hard when they're hurting and you don't know what to do. You guys are angels. Thank you for everything. Please don't forget to tell Irene that I need her for that tuesday shift. You got it. Okay. All right. Here we go. Oh, crap! You owe me fettuccine for a week. Also, I'm partial to meatballs. Ah! I'll remember that, Dwight. Mm-hmm. You're my boo! Thank you! You're welcome. On-call pediatrics resident to the I.V pharmacy. Okay, Mrs. Ramos. It's not fancy, but think of it this way... it's your own private suite. Well, this is different. I got her a bed. Yeah, you did. Mm-hmm. In a closet. Storage room. Oh! Oh, that's... that's different. How's your neuro patient? Oh, he's fine. He's... he's in the... the real I.C.U. You know, the one that's not so medically dubious? Oh, I do. Yeah. I found him the bed, remember? So I'm guessing this is the part where I'm supposed to tell you that you're crazy? Is it? Yeah, and try and argue with you. Now, that sounds familiar. And tell you that you can't do this. Mm, right. And then you say, "Oh, too late, already done." You know me so well. So I'll skip that part. What a guy. You are unbelievable. Thank you. You know what? It's beautiful. Yeah. I hope Eddie likes it. And you got him his extra 24 hours. I did. Chief ortho resident to pre-op. Chief ortho resident to pre-op. Mary? Can we talk to you for a second? Oh, what is it? Did they find something? Oh, no, nothing like that. Miss Barth, I need to ask you some questions. Okay. What questions? It's not a big deal. This is just routine. It's standard procedure when a child has ingested something toxic. Wait, but I... I told them, she hasn't ingested anything... it's not possible. Well, according to the urine test, she did. I thought you said they were gonna run that test again. They ran it twice the first time. Both tests were positive. Can we... Who are you? I'm the director of social work here at the hospital. Social work? What do I need a social worker for? Your child had a seizure that's been linked to a toxic household chemical. For the child's safety, it's my job to... Am I being accused of something? No, of course not. No one's accusing you of anything. This is my daughter! You're talking about my baby! I would never do anything to hurt her! Okay? How ya doin' in there?! Well, this is a very confusing shower. Actually, it's pretty standard. And the right handle is... Cold. Cold, Dolores. You can tell that because if you turn it to the right, it gets colder. Ooh, it certainly does! And... and how does this little thingy work? What little thingy? You mean... You mean the handheld, uh... ...nozzle? Oh, did I get you with that? Oh, just a little. It's okay. Oh, this shower is wonderful! How can I ever thank you? Oh, no need. My job is its own reward. She seems pretty defensive. I think we may have to involve the cops. What?! Involve the cops?! You... you talked to her for like two minutes! It's like you already decided that she was guilty! I have no idea whether she's guilty or not, but there's a standard procedure to follow in a case like this. Kelly... No, I know. I'm naive, I'm new, I'm supposed to be a pit bull... Whatever. But you haven't seen her with her child. She loves her so much. She would never do anything like this. Okay. But what if she did? She didn't. But is it possible? Well, I mean, of course, anything's possible. That's right. So in a case like this, you have to err on the side of the child. If there's any doubt at all that this mother might have hurt her kid, we can't take that chance. I'll make the call. And you might want to have someone in there with her at all times. That room is full of potentially harmful chemicals. What's going on? Excuse me? This is so... She would never approve of this. I'm sorry, and you are...? Esther. I'm her daughter. Right. Esther. Eddie's mentioned you quite a bit. I'm Christina Hawthorne. I know who you are. Please... Shut it off. Now. Wait a minute. Esther. There's no rush. I set that room up so that Eddie could have more time. He doesn't need any more time. Enough is enough! Look, I know that you and your entire family are having a very difficult time with this, I'm sure. But I also know that Eddie's really been struggling with this decision. My mother made her wishes very clear. She did not want to be put on life support. She always said that when God called, she would go. She would hate this, and Eddie knows that. Some people need more time to say goodbye than others. That's why I'm handling this now. That's not my mother in there. My mother is already gone. Now it's time for us to let her go. Well, maybe if I could just get Eddie on the phone... He doesn't want to talk to you. He wants to be left out of it. I do not understand what the problem is. Well, I'm a nurse. I'm not authorized to discontinue life support. Then get me somebody who is. Dr. Stevedam, call the billing office. Dr. Stevedam, call the billing office. Hey. What's going on? She doesn't need the monitor anymore, and I'm just gonna take her for a moment, check her weight again. Wait... wait a minute. W... wait. What is this? Wait, where are you taking her?! Ma'am, you just need to stay calm, okay? I don't understand why you're doing this. Tell them! Tell them I didn't do anything! We just have some questions. I want my baby! I want my baby! Ma'am, leave it! I want my baby right now! Take it easy! You can't do this. It's not right! I didn't do anything! Ma'am, leave it! Whoa, don't! You need to come with us, okay? Tell Nancy I'll get back to her about this. Hey, Eddie. It's Christina again. I really need you to call me as soon as possible, okay? All right, thanks. Uh, hey, I wanted to warn you. There's an Esther Ramos up in Morrissey's office. She's raising hell. I know. She's Eddie's sister. She came out of nowhere wanting to pull the plug. I can't let that happen. Yeah, well, Morrissey's gonna hit the roof if he sees this. Where the hell's Eddie? I tried calling him 10 times. He's not answering his phone. Okay, listen. I know she has every right to do this, but I promised him, and his 24 hours aren't up yet. And don't you think he deserves a chance to say goodbye to his mother? All right, you call admitting. I'll call legal. Keep trying Eddie on his cell. Okay. These are medicated wipes. Okay. Well, what do they put in medicated wipes? Same stuff they put in the hand sanitizers, I think. Why? No. Oh, God, no, no, no. And I called the lab, and they said that if she was using these to wipe her baby clean... Which she was, 'cause I saw her use them twice in one hour... They said that that would totally account for the amount of Isopropanol in her system, which means that she was right... Eve wasn't drinking rubbing alcohol. She was... she was taking it through her skin. And all she was trying to do was protect her baby. Damn it. Damn it. Hey. It's Bobbie in the E.R. We made a mistake with that mom. You've got to call the cops and... Yes, that baby. Absolutely. Okay, thanks. Go get that baby from peds. Now, Kelly, go! So then I realized I had forgotten my good brush and comb at home. I don't know what I was thinking! And now my son is coming, and I was wondering if you would get something for me from the gift shop. No. What? No. Dolores, I can't get you anything at the gift shop, okay? Do you want to know why? You do. Okay. Because I'm not a bus boy. And I'm not a concierge. And I'm not a cable guy. I'm a nurse. All right? I'm an actual medical professional, in case you didn't know that. I went to school and everything. And, you know, I may not be a doctor, okay? I may not get to put the "M.D." at the end of my name, but in most cases, I know as much as they do, if not more. I do. And I don't see them looking for movie channels! The point, Dolores, is that I would just really appreciate it if you could treat me with the same respect that you do them. And only summon me for actual medical problems, okay? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to put you out. Just go. Please, I... I'm fine. I know you have important things to do. Yeah. Okay, good. Great. Why'd you hide that? 'Cause... I thought you were my mom. She doesn't like me playing with these things. My mom is such a drag. Yeah. Tell me about it. So, uh, what happened to you? I had to get some surgery done on my arm. I ran my skateboard into a car. That was dumb. Well, I didn't do it on purpose. That's even worse. Oh, yeah? Well, why are you here? You know, I'm glad you asked. I have a very rare disorder of the bones, where they get sort of, mm, soft. I used to be much taller than this. Well, that sucks. Yes, it does. Fortunately, I am a very strong person... mentally, I mean. Physically, I'm very weak, like I said. You're all alone here? Yep, parents have work. My dad's gonna be here in a little while. Oh. Okay. Later. Wait! I'm on level 2. What? On the game... I'm on level 2. I know that doesn't sound like a very high level, but... it's a pretty difficult game. Well, I bet I can make it to level 4 in under 10 minutes. I bet you can't. Yeah? How much money you got? No, we don't need the bioethics committee. Well, is there some type of backup or... No, I understand that. But this is happening right now. I don't know. No, no, no, no, I tried that number. Okay, no, I don't... Right, um... Listen, I got to go. Gee, you think he looks mad? I do. Mm-hmm. Ms. Ramos here says we're disregarding a patient's healthcare proxy orders. Yeah, we were just discussing... There's nothing to discuss. The patient's wishes were very clear. This is clearly against those wishes. Yes, but there is another... No. What the hell is this? You think you know better than the patient's daughter does whether she wants to be kept alive on a machine? Or are you having trouble handling this nurse? Excuse me? I can assure you, our chief nursing officer is quite capable of handling herself. Really? Then why am I here? I don't know. That's a good question, John. Why are you here? I'm here to make sure we're not sued for malpractice for installing a life-support patient in a storage room. Now pull the damn plug... And do it now. That went well. You ready? I can't... I can't watch. I'll be in the waiting room. I didn't mean to get you in the middle of this. It's okay. I got myself in the middle of it. I really just wanted to make this easier for him. Yeah, but he's not your patient, Christina. She is. Think it's impossible to say good bye to the people you love. You ready? Ready? Hey. Hey. Need some help? No... Candy? Candy! Oh my God. Ray? Bye. Hey. What happened to you? It was just a patient. I had a needy patient. I'm so sorry that I didn't make it. Oh, you know what? It's okay. It wasn't that bad. I mean, I almost died of boredom. but I could really use a drink. Yeah, me too. Do you wanna meet me outside in 10? Is that an invitation? Do you want to or not? Yes, I want to. Okay. Yes, I definitely want to. Then let's do it. Okay. All right. I'm just gonna report out, and, boom, I'll be there. Okay. Okay. Look at me, rolling in the dough! What to buy, what to buy? Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Taking advantage of a kid? Actually, no. We can play for your shoes now, if you want. No, thanks. I need my shoes. I should probably get back to my room, 'cause if my dad shows up and I'm not there, he'll freak. He's kind of like this massive worrier. Yeah, my dad was a pretty big worrier, too. "Was"? What happened to him? He died... a year ago. Do you miss him? Every day. Sometimes twice a day. Wow. That must really suck. Yes. It does. Oh! Crap, is that the time? My mom is not going to be worried. She's going to be murderous. I hope your arm feels better. Oh...thanks. And I hope your, um... bone thing feels better, too. Actually, it's more like a 24-hour thing, kind of like the stomach flu, so I'm, like, basically done. Can't you see how much taller I am? I'm so sorry. I...I want you to know that they shouldn't have done that to you. And it was awful, and it wasn't right. And, I mean, I can't imagine what it must feel like to be accused of something that you would never do. Anyway... I'm sorry. You have nothing to apologize for. But I do. I should have done something. I... I should have stopped them. No, a... actually, I think you're the reason I'm not in a holding cell right now. Thank you so much for everything. ay bye bye, Eve. Say bye bye. Bye. Thanks. Bye. Hey. What did you tell her? I told her you're our resident Columbo. I told her you're a pit bull. Really? Yeah. What can I say? I lied. Now, before you clock out, you should check on that patient in trauma 2. I think he's gonna hurl. So, the next shift should be arriving any minute now. And I'm sure they're gonna be very happy to help you with all your wants and needs... And help you and the prodigal son get set up with a movie. Maybe a Jim Carrey kind of thing, huh? Are you okay? Fine. Oh, nice flowers. Thank you. My son sent them. He's not coming? It's no big deal. I'm sure he'll come some other day. Anyway, I'm... I'm really sorry. No. No, no. Thank you for everything. You were fine. You take care, okay? I'm sorry if I was a little... Anyway... Hey. Hey. Are you okay? I'm fine. I just, uh... promised a guy he would have the chance to say goodbye to his mother. I let him down. I'm sorry. How was your day? Kind of interesting, actually. Interesting? I bet. All the people you lied to. All the kids you gambled with. Okay. That's spooky. How did you know that? Well, Richmond Trinity is my hospital, and I know my hospital. And you're my daughter, and I know my daughter. Well... I also did this. What's that? That's not you doing something disgusting on youtube, is it? Just watch it. "If we spirits have offended, think but this, and all is mended. that you have but slumbered here... ... while these visions did appear." I think what Shakespeare meant is that life is a dream... ... which is pretty cool. Because if we're all dreaming, then each day is a new chance to dream something different. Something better, maybe. A chance to dream ourselves better. Goodbye, mom. Goodbye. "A chance to dream ourselves better."
