 Michael? Michael! # HawthoRNe 1x10 # Hello and Goodbye Original Air Date on August 18, 2009 Tom: Your white blood cell count's up. I-I don't understand why this antibiotic isn't working. It made me nauseous. Well, you have to take it with food. He tried, but -- You stopped taking it? Well, I wish you would have told me

 because now you have an infection. Can you give him something else? Of course. But the point is this infection jeopardizes your acceptance into the clinical trial. You're not taking away his spot? Can't we fix this somehow? Start over with the pills? Get his fever down? Oh, we can get the fever down. That's not a problem. Here, you have to take this, okay? What about the trial? Well, Max, if you get in -- And that's an "if" -- You have to promise me you'll take your medication. You can't just go off your meds without telling anybody.

 You know, for one, it screws up the results, and, secondly, it's not fair to Dr. Cohen or the other subjects. He promises. Well, I need to hear it from you. Promise. All right, I'll see what I can do. Please. If he doesn't get in... I'm sure it'll work out. mm. [sirens wailing in distance] Woman on p.a.: Dr. Reynolds to O.R. 1. Dr. Reynolds to O.R. 1. Hey, Bobbie, What's he in for? Is this about his cancer? Ask him yourself. Hey, girl. David, what happened? Skydiving into a rosebush. But you know something? It could have been much worse. So, this is about you jumping out of a plane? Yep. Well, at least you had your parachute on this time. Did you call for a psych consult? (Tom) No, she called me. - Hey, David. - Hey. Ooh, nice. So, last month, skateboarding injury. What'd you do this time? Skydiving. Skydiving? Skydiving. I like skydiving. Oh, hey, you want to go with me on Saturday? Sure. Want to go? Uh, so I can leave Camille an orphan just in case one of those thingies jam? Uh, I don't think so. Suit yourself. I need some 4-0 prolene. Be right back. Tom. Well, I'm glad to see he's got this whole "living life to the fullest" thing down. -I should get that 4-0. - No. Tom, what aren't you telling me? His cancer's back. Stage four. Then, what the hell is he doing jumping out of planes? Why isn't he upstairs? 'cause he doesn't want to be. How long have you known this? Couple weeks. Why didn't you tell me? Look, we discussed telling you. And you decided not to tell me. No, David decided not to. He didn't want you to know. [ siren wailing ] Hi, guys. Bay 3. No, absolutely not. Back outside. Come on, Bobbie, you just got to let me talk to you. I told you yesterday and the day before -- until you bring back what you stole from me, we have nothing to discuss. - But Bobbie... - You heard her, back outside. How about I just wait for you in the corner until you get finished here? I have patients to care for, Isabel. You are not a patient. Now, get out before I call security. Hey. Oh. Nurse Stein. Uh, I think we need to talk. Oh? About what happened the other day. - What happened? - You know. What day was that? Izz, Come on, you know what I'm talking about. Oh, yeah, that day. Right. Listen. We both know it was a mistake. Come on, we don't even like each other. - Ah? - Not that I don't think you're a smart and -- an..and strong..and sexy woman. Wow. Go on, please. Yeah, I just think that we can be really good friends. Okay, let me help you out here, Steiny. I think what you want to say is it was a mistake, let's put it behind us and move on. Yeah. Because the most important thing is that we preserve our working relationship, - Yes. - Act professionally, - Professionally. - Right? - Priorities, yeah. - Absolutely. - Okay. - Okay. Good. So, uh, yeah, hey, like, should we... Oh, that's not necessary. No. Okay. Good. Good. See you later, Doctor. Good. [Camille ] Damn, grandma, your job rocks! I know. I mean, we talk to paramedics, we order new artwork for the lobby, we get our nails done. You know, I think, when I grow up, I want to be you. Oh, thank you, sweetheart. I can't tell you how long I've waited to hear those words. To tell you the truth, I was terrified you were gonna decide to become a nurse. But to be honest with you, my life is not as easy as it seems. I mean, being a strong, powerful woman is often a thankless job. Men are afraid of you. Women are threatened by you. You know, the truth is, a powerful woman often stands alone. How about a snack? I have some nutrition bars. I recommend the ones that are beefed up with a lot of fiber. They're my secret weapon. Never underestimate the importance of regular bowels. Grandma! What? It's a natural function of the body. No, you see, the thing is, I'm supposed to, like, write a report on all this stuff, so... So, write this down. "good things come to those who wait... And to those who eat fiber." (Christina) Hey, David! Oh, look at you-- I got to go, Christina! Wait! Sorry. Got to go. - David - I love you, but goodbye. Oh, David. Let me just stop you right there, okay? What, I haven't said anything yet. But you will, Christina. You always do. You are gonna try to convince me to check myself back in, right? So you can save me, so we can beat this thing, so we can find yet another miracle. And what's so wrong with that, huh? Wouldn't you want that? You know what I did this morning? What? I had waffles with my brother. Now, up until a month ago, Greg and I hadn't spoken in seven years, Christina. I mean, you know this. Seven years. But this morning, we had breakfast, and we just laughed and laughed. So, when I say I'm okay, I really am okay. Shoot, I can't even stand being in this parking lot. And you know why? Because I want to be out there somewhere. Listen. When I went into remission, you told me to live my life, remember? yes. And I am. So... Unless you've got some miracle cure hidden away somewhere... Maybe I do have a miracle. There's a clinical trial going on right now with a very promising drug, David. Yeah, Tom and I talked about that. This is your life. You have got to at least try. Now, I'm your friend. Would I steer you wrong? Do you really think you can get me in? My name is Christina Hawthorne. Oh ho ho! I cannot believe I'm gonna say this. Okay, Christina, okay. I'll make it happen. Thank you. Enjoy that beautiful ride right there. Ha, ha. [ car door open tones ] [ door opens ] [ car door closes ] And I know how much you like our toothpaste, so I'm throwing in a few extra tubes for you to take home with you. See? Mommy. You're so welcome. I'm gonna miss you, too. So much, I can't even say. But (sighs) your pneumonia is completely gone now, so that's a wonderful, wonderful thing. Let's focus on that. Well... This is it. I'll be on 2 West. Yeah, that's cool. Well, I had to promise them my firstborn, but you're in. Oh, thank god! I can't believe it. So, I'll have a nurse help you settle in. But please remember that being in the trial is no guarantee of anything. Don't worry. We know. We're just happy to get the chance, just getting into the trial is a miracle. Thank you, Tom. You're welcome. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Oh, this is Christina Hawthorne, our chief nursing officer. This is Max and Janice Miller. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Thank you again, Tom. You're very welcome. Hey, listen, I need a favor. I need you to get David into Dr. Cohen's clinical trial. Don't you think that if the clinical trial was even an option, I would have tried it weeks ago? But, "A," the trial is full. And, "B," David's not even a candidate. Forget it. Getting him into the trial is completely impossible. Okay? Just trust me on this one. Tom, come on, the guy gets a new passion for life and now you just expect him to give up? Come on, that's not fair. David understands all of that. He's made peace with it. I just spoke with him. Please tell me you didn't give him false hope. David needs to take this shot. He doesn't want it. Okay, I'm his doctor. We've reviewed all the options. Christina, you're always asking people to trust you. Trust me on this one. Leave it alone. Okay. Christina. What? Leave it alone. It's been proven scientifically that caffeine makes you smarter. Ask the French, Camille. You bet. Gracias, Ramone. Oh no, you keep the quarter. The name's "Dan." Now, you'll notice that I was at all times both courteous and respectful with that employee. You see, one of the tricks of the powerful woman is that she presents herself more submissive than she truly is, thus disorienting her opponent. You see, your mother treats every confrontation like it's being held in the stands of a tractor pull. Now, you may wonder, is that coffee-cart worker really an opponent? To which I respond, "they're all opponents." (Dr. Cohen) This man is stage four. I realize that. Then you realize you're asking for the impossible. This trial is for patients in stage two. He is quite a fighter. I've already filled the last spot. Come on. You can open another slot. I wish Mr. Gendler luck. Now, if you'll excuse me... Did I tell you that he went into remission for six months? Now, that in itself is a miracle. Makes him a very unique candidate. Can any of your other patients in your study make that claim? He still doesn't qualify. Even if I added another slot, I still wouldn't let Mr. Gendler into the trial. It wouldn't be fair. I'm a chief nursing officer at Richmond Trinity. Have you ever conducted any of your studies out of our hospital? Not yet, but I've had something under consideration for almost a year now. And I did mention that my name is Christina Hawthorne. Amanda Hawthorne happens to be my mother-in-law. I- I didn't know. Well, the whole black and white thing gets people a little confused. But Amanda also stands very strongly behind important research. Are you saying that if I get David Gendler into this trial, you'll get Amanda Hawthorne to consider my research proposal? What I'm saying is that opening another slot couldn't hurt. It still isn't likely that a man as far-gone as Mr. Gendler would even make it through the trial, but -- Does that mean he's in? He's in. Thank you. Yeah. Dr. Panelle to peds. Dr. Panelle to peds. Hi. Ray. I was just thinking about you. -Yeah, uh (chuckles) -That's weird. You look amazing, by the way. What -- something -- Oh, yeah, it's your scrubs. Ray, Ray, listen. [buzzer] Okay. I'm listening. We need to talk. Okay, um, just hold on before you say anything. Before you say anything, I started a new allergy medicine, and it has made me temporarily insane. What? (whistles) Nuts. [ beep, beep ] [ continues ] Oh. Oh, crap. I got to go. Okay, you know what, this is really important. Okay, I will find you later. I promise. Really. Um... (knocks) Dr. Marshall? Ah, nurse Stein. Pager on the fritz? I just got the page. On a break? No. Yes, I was. Yeah, have a snack? A burger, maybe? Some fries? Oh, that sounds delicious. What did you have today, Mr. Campbell? Jell-O. Ugh. Jell-O. Jell-O. Well, that sounds good, too. (chuckles) He's also supposed to be having I.V. fluids, nurse Stein, but it appears his I.V. line is clogged. Oh, let me get that fixed for you right away, sir. Yeah. Are you sure? Because we don't want to interrupt your busy schedule, nurse Stein. Sometimes with this nurse, his priorities get a little out of whack. You let me know if you have more troubles, okay? -Thank you. - You're welcome. Excuse me. (Over P.A.) Dr. Hammond, O.R. 1. Okay, excuse me, What was that? What was what? Hey, you said you wouldn't let what happened affect our working relationship. Right, well, this is our working relationship, Stein. I'm the doctor and you're the nurse. Did you tell Candy? Who's Candy? Oh, come on. Oh, you mean that little blond-nurse person? What, are you guys -- No, no. Good, because that'd be very unprofessional, wouldn't it? Yep. So, we'll get you in a gown, and we'll get some bloodwork done. I still can't believe this is happening. You better believe it. Yeah, but how did you do it? Oh. Don't you worry about that, okay? You just worry about getting better. You really think I'll make it through this trial? Are you kidding me? Coming from a guy who survived jumping off a roof and then went into remission? Please. I think you can do just about anything you want. You really are a miracle-worker, aren't you? I try. I'll be back. - Bobbie. - Yeah? I got a goodbye card for Mr. Fleming. Will you sign it? You're so sweet. Here. Did you get him a gift? Oh, I thought the card was a gift. You know what he loves? Chocolates. He stole a couple off my desk last week. He was in heaven. Oh, okay, great idea. I'll get him chocolates. But nothing with nuts in it. The nuts get in his dentures. Ray! Wait. What's up? I need to talk to you. W- wait, wait. It was an accident. And I never intended to make out with Marshall. Okay? (laughs) You made out with Marshall?! (whispers) You made out with Marshall? (chuckles) Oh, boy, Why is this happening to me? Wow! I, uh, was just gonna give you a heads-up on a patient. But let's talk about your thing. It's way more fun. I thought you were in love with Candy. I am in love with Candy. How do you know that? Everybody knows that. What do you mean everybody? Who's everybody? Well, people who work here, people who don't work here, people who live under rocks. It was an accident, okay? I told you that. I don't know what that means. You -- you slipped and your tongue fell in her mouth? Sort of. And now she's got it out for me. And what am I gonna tell Candy? - Well -- - I could tell her that Marshall is a pathological liar. Or, you know what, I could say it wasn't me. Or I could kill Marshall, and I could just dump her body in a swamp. Or you could tell Candy the truth. No, that'll never work. No, trust me. It's always best to be up front with people. Yeah, you're right. Now, tell the truth -- Does Marshall have a tiny, secret penis? I have to go now. [ Bobbie ] (laughing) (knocks) Hey. You wanted to see me? I just got off the phone with Cohen. You bumped my patient. What? Don't pretend like you don't know. Tom, all I did was ask Cohen -- By bumping my patient. I didn't think she was-- No, you didn't think, Christina, did you? You never do. And not only did you completely disregard my opinion on this and go behind my back, you did something I specifically told you not to do instead of just trusting me. Okay, can you just calm down? Don't tell me to calm down! I'm Chief of Surgery! I am not some intern punk you can just steamroll over. David is dying. And I have a patient who fits the profile perfectly, someone we can save, and you just tossed him aside like he was nothing. And now you've sentenced a man to death to try and save someone who can't be saved. I'm done, Christina. I can't take this anymore. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means you act like you own this damn place, and your job is to make sure the rest of us don't screw things up. Well, I got news for you -- I've been running interference for your ass all over this damn hospital, and the one time I ask you to respect my decision, to respect me... You stab me in the back like that? (sighs) I'm sorry if -- Just save it. Save it, okay? I don't need your half-assed apologies, 'cause you don't care. And one last thing -- You want to butt heads with Morrissey and Amanda and whoever the hell else, go ahead, be my guest. But interfere with my patients? Not a chance in hell. We're through, Christina. I'm done. I don't get it. I did what you asked. No, no, no, I didn't ask you to bump another patient. Okay? I asked you to open a new slot I did! No, you didn't. You bumped Wakefield's patient. Please. Don't give me that. You know how the game is played. It sounds like you have a decision to make. Two folders, two patients. The trial starts tomorrow. Which one is in? Max Miller. Gendler's out. "love, Candy"? I only wrote "your friend." Yeah, what can I say? I have a lot of love in my heart today. Do we have any white-out? Aha! Yep. Here you go. I'm getting him a cake, too. We're having a little celebration at the end of the day. Is Ray gonna be there? Yeah. Everyone will. I thought it'd be great for him, you know? Everyone together one last time. What time? End of shift. Mario in the kitchen is hooking me up. You know what, don't let Ray leave until I get there, got it? Uh-huh. Goodbyes are really important. I know. (Isabel) I want Bobbie Jackson! That's the only nurse I want! I don't want you. Somebody page Bobbie Jackson, please. [ curtains opening ] Damn it. Self-inflicted? She wouldn't let me touch her. Let me guess -- you got into a fight with a one-legged man? (laughing) Yeah, something like that. You in pain? Not too bad. Let's take a look. Heinz or Hunt's? Squeezy packets from Whataburger. You are so out of here. Come on, Bobbie. I had to do it. It was the only way you was gonna let me apologize. That titanium leg is worth as much as a car. Besides which, it's my leg. I'm sorry. Okay. You've apologized. So we're done. Wait, no, no, Bobbie. Come on. Wait. Just give me five minutes. Two. I don't know what I was thinking. I just wanted the leg. I don't know. To borrow it or something. But then everybody thought it was cool, and everybody wanted it, so I traded it, and then the next day, I felt bad and I went after the boy who got it. I wanted to give it back to you, but by then, my boy had sold it, and he said it went to mean Marco, and I'm sorry, baby girl, but that's where I draw the line, 'cause he's crazy-mean, and I would have never got it away from him, so I had to give it up. Okay. What -- What you mean, "okay"? Okay, as in, apology accepted. It's my fault, really. Your fault? Forget it. Let's go. Oh. What? It's your fault for ever letting me in your house in the first place. I'm saying I forgive you. You're thinking you got what you deserved for being stupid -- Inviting a crazy woman from the streets to crash on your couch. And there I was, thinking you wanted to be my friend. (woman) Wow! (Candy) Yeah, I didn't want to say anything until I was absolutely sure. (Brenda) Oh. Understandable. Thank you. Yep. W- what was that all about? Hello, nurse Stein. What did you say to Candy? Who's Candy? And why are your ears so red? Cut it out. Just cut it out! Cut what out? Look, just stop it. I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. Oh, please. Okay, you know something, Marshall? I see right through you! Yeah, I think you act all tough and mean because you don't want to admit to yourself that even though you're this highly successful surgeon, right, with this great reputation, really, you're just a lonely woman who goes home to an empty house and eats TV dinners. And you're a lonely nurse who goes home to a takeout pizza on a futon bed and dreams about a blond nurse who doesn't even know he exists! Yeah, you don't know anything about me, okay? And you never will, Marshall! Because you're too arrogant to see outside your little, airless bubble! And you're not man enough to know what you want, much less how to get it! I know I don't want you! And you'll never have me! No, Stein, because you're a nurse! Sleeping with you would be like sleeping with the help! David, I -- I should make you squirm. But I just can't do that. Tom told me already. I'm so sorry. Listen, thanks for trying. I probably shouldn't have promised to -- No, Christina. Stop. I'm not gonna let you beat yourself up when someone can't be saved. I don't need to be saved anymore, girl. You have done that for me a hundred times over. Thank you. Is there anything else I can do? There is. You have to let me go. I know it's hard. And you know you suck at it. Let me ask you a question. Why are you still wearing that wedding band around your neck? So I can remember Michael. You won't forget. So let it go. Let it all go. Nobody wants to be sitting on a cloud having their paradise ruined while you're down here feeling all guilty. Okay. Attagirl. So... You want to go skydiving with me? I promise, you will never feel more alive. Okay, sure. How about a year from now? (laughs) Oh, that's cold. But okay. Okay. Deal. Shoot, I'll be there one way or another. (laughing) [ woman on P.A. speaks indistinctly ] I'm screwed. I'm so screwed. (Kelly) Do you know the secret to throwing a great party, Mr. Fleming? Preparation. According to my mom, preparation is the key to success. Mommy. She also said marrying money doesn't hurt, either. Okay, now, remember, Mr. Fleming. If we're running low on snacks, it's fhb -- family, hold back. All right? Let's let the fun begin! â™ª Everybody on the â™ª dance floor - whoo! â™ª Everybody on the dance floor All right, let's get this party started! â™ª I'm just dancing through the night â™ª All right! Okay. We'll just start with a little somethin'- somethin' to get us in the spirit, right, Mr. Fleming? Mommy. My feeling exactly. Here's to you, Mr. Fleming. Oh, yeah. That's nice. â™ª Let's do it till the break of dawn â™ª â™ª let's do it, dance, dance, â™ª â™ª let's do it dance to the rhythm, â™ª â™ª dance through the night â™ª â™ª come on, baby, let's do it all night â™ª â™ª just shake [ electric doors opening ] -You finished? - Yeah. (John) Amanda. John. Pardon me for interrupting. Do you mind if I join you for a moment? No. Please do. Any idea where your daughter-in-law is? I imagine she's off doing something healthcare-related. You'd think so, wouldn't you? In actuality, she's been, uh... visiting neighboring hospitals this morning, handing out favors, using your name, as a matter of fact. Really? Forgive me for saying so, she's completely out of control. She runs around like she's in charge of this hospital. But the truth is, this kind of behavior is going to have grave consequences, and I don't want this hospital suffering as a result. She's a loose cannon. Yes, I -- I know what you mean. Well, if you see her, will you tell her I'm looking for her? Will do, John. Thank you. Excuse me. (Amanda) Ah. Why don't we go down to the -- What's wrong? Nothing. Um, I think I've had enough for today. But there's so much more to see and I have so much more wisdom to impart to you. It's okay. I've got all I need for my report, anyway. Darling, I set aside the whole day so that we could spend it together. I thought we were having a lovely time. Why didn't you stand up for her? What? Why did you let him talk about her like that? All he said was that she was a loose cannon. I know what he said. Okay, but what he said was true. I don't care if what he said was true, grandma. It doesn't matter. You stand up for your family no matter what. You know, ever since dad died -- What? I'm the kid. I shouldn't ha-- It shouldn't be like this. I am sick and tired of having to play the parent around you and mom! It's not fair! It's not my job! And I don't want to do it anymore! You guys are driving me crazy. Why can't you just get along?! You two are all I have. You don't get it. Camille. Camille! Ray? Mm-hmm. I'm here. I'm here. I don't remember... If I remembered to invite anybody. It's okay. It's all right. Oh, but I do remember that you need to stay here until Candy gets here. What do you mean? Candy is here. Candy? Where? Candy's at the door. â™ª Oh, I'm moving on Please tell me this is a costume party. My, uh -- My unit was called up. I'm going to Afghanistan as a combat nurse. You're kidding me. No. How long is the tour? Six months. Six months? â™ª It was wrong You promise me you'll keep your head on a swivel and you will take good care of the troops. Yeah. But not the happy-ending kind of good care. Promise me that you'll stop (inhales) having scraps with all the doctors. mm. And that, um... You'll see somebody while I'm gone. Oh, yeah, that's me, the dating machine. Do you know how hard it is to say goodbye to you? (Kelly) I do. I had to put my cat, Murray, down two years ago. And it's still really hard on me. Punch? Hey. â™ª I was troubled â™ª I was moving on â™ª I was moving along â™ª you can rely on â™ª you were only loving you... Mommy! Sonny! Sonny! ohh! Ohh, (laughs) Let's get the hell out of here. Come on. Ray. Yeah? I know this sounds crazy... But I was kind of hoping Mr. Fleming would say my name just one time. Just once. Hey. Can I come in? Can I sit down? Please? You were right. About everything. It's not about David. It's about Michael. It's been about Michael. It's been about Michael for the past year. It's just -- When he died, I thought I would crawl under the covers and never come out. Instead, I haven't been able to sit still. Every patient that comes in here, I'm just manic. I must drive you crazy. I'm sorry. (sighs) I just thought it's what made me a good nurse. I... You've always been a good nurse. Did he ever tell you... About the problems in our marriage? We were filing for divorce. And then he got sick. And I was like, "wow, okay, I know what this is. This is what I do. I take care of sick people for a living. You know? The sicker he got, the more I loved him. And the more he need me, the more I needed him. And we were finally happy. And every night, we would pray. No, literally, we would hold hands and we would pray together. Not once... ...not one time... Did I ever pray for him to get better. I didn't want him to die and I didn't want him to be sick. But I didn't want him to get better... Because it was perfect. Tom, I loved him more than -- Than I ever had. I couldn't help but think... "what wife does that?" (sniffles) (sighs) No way. Oh, yes. Way. I'm good. I ain't feeling no pain right now -- Then you're in shock. You should see the other guy. Mean Marco? I'll tell you something about mean Marco. He's mean, all right. But he ain't got the moves. We square now? Actually, no. Wait, what's the matter? It get broken or something? I appreciate the gesture, Isabel, but that's not my leg. (phone ringing) (laughing together) I just got played. You -- Now we're square. Come on. You need stitches. Ohh, I don't want no charity. I'm not offering any. I'm just doing a favor for a friend. ohh. Look, I don't know too much about it, but I heard that sometimes friends let friends crash on their couch. You know, like, when it's cold outside, or sometimes when it's hot, or even sometimes when it's medium. (laughing) (knocking) Hey, you busy? Hey, no. Come on in. Where's Camille? Oh, well... I guess she had enough of her cranky old grandma today. Don't be silly. You're not old. (laughing) ohh. You know, Christina... You're not the easiest person in the world to get along with. Amanda, can we not do this today, okay? 'cause I've had a very long, crazy day. Actually, it's been a long, crazy year. You know, I wasn't the perfect mother. And you sure as hell weren't the perfect wife. But you were at the end. You did right by my son, Christina, and I never thanked you for it. No need. What else is this about, Amanda? It's about Camille. And us doing right by her. The truth is... The whole "son in the urn on the mantel" was a tad disturbing. And Michael always loved the ocean. Christina. Anything you want to say? I love you, Dad. What is that saying? It's on the tip of my tongue. "Death leaves a heartache that no one can heal. But love leaves a..." "love leaves a memory... (both) That no one can steal."
