 As a reward for his denunciation of Martin Luther, the Pope christens Henry "Defender of the Faith," but a brush with death causes the king to seek a solution to his lack of an heir.

He's an old man! My sister margaret is to marry the king of portugal. I want you to escort her and her dowry to lisbon. I'm surprised my brother chose a man without noble blood to represent him. You trust me with a beautiful woman? Of course I trust you. Why shouldn't I? What is the emperor's attitude to the rise of the lutheran heresy? His highness does everything in his power to suppress it. My king is writing a pamphlet. Demolishing luther's arguments.

 King francis has already discovered our rapprochement with the emperor. And is making threats against our interests. Who told him? Mr. Pace. You not only spy for me, you also spy for the french. No,it's not true! I beg you! You know it's not true! Listen to me! I didn't do anything! I'm innocent! It was wolsey! Wolsey! Wolsey! You think you know a story. But you only know how it ends. To get to the heart of the story, you have to go back to the beginning. - =www. ydy. com/bbs=- proudly presents sync:YTET-cflily - =www. ydy. com/bbs=-  THE TUDORS Season 01 Episode 04 Advertise your product or brand here contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today His majesty,the king. My dear sister. Fare you well on your journey. Remember the king of portugal, your future husband, loves and respects you. You must love him in return. Remember your promise! When he dies, I marry whom I choose. Charles. As you love me, take care of her. I will. You may have no doubts. I shall treat her as if she were my own sister. God be with all of you! And remember your duties, to my lady and to england. Let us pray. His holiness thanked god for raising up such a prince to be a champion of the church. He expressed astonishment that you'd found time to write the pamphlet. Furthermore,in order to show his gratitude the pope has decided to honour you with a new title: Fidei defensor. Fidei defensor. Defender of the faith. But your majesty should know that martin luther has also responded to your work. What did he say? Well he accuses you of... yes? He accuses you of raving like a strumpet in a tantrum. What!? He says if the king of england gives himself the right to spew out falsehoods, then he gives me the right to stuff He ought to be burned! Give me a hand with these ropes! This is your stateroom. I hope it meets with your highness's approval. It'll serve. The bed is narrow but adequate. In the case of action all this Action? If we are attacked. Who will attack us? Pirates. It seems to me, your grace, we have more to fear from the pirates already onboard! Good morning,madam. Your majesty. Your majesty, lady anne... clifford. Your majesty. ******** Your gracious majesty. It causes me such pain and grief to return the gifts you gave Alas,they are too beautiful and I unworthy to receive them... I think I never gave your majesty cause to give them to me, since I am nothing and you are everything. Give them,I pray you, to a lady more deserving of your majesty's affections. I am leaving now for my family's house at hever. I shall think of you on the journey there. Your loving servant, anne boleyn. TOWER OF LONDON Mr. Pace. At your service,sir. You are to be released. I don't know anything. What's that? I said,you're to be released. I told my wife. I said: I don't know anything. Anything at all. You,told your wife, mr. Pace? When? Shh... she's sleeping. We talk together. I thought she had died when she gave birth to our son. I was sure I... I went to the funeral,and wept. But now... I see she's alive and as well as I. Do you not see her? Yes,mr. Pace. I see her. Mr. Cromwell! Eminence. I have long noticed your aptitude for work and your diligence in carrying through my affairs. And your discretion. I am grateful to your eminence. You are of obscure stock. But then so am I. It should not be held against you. I may have a proposition to put to you. Thank you,your eminence. By the terms of our treaty with the emperor, we are obliged to support his war effort financially. At present his armies are fighting the french in italy. Near milan. Unfortunately,I have calculated that in order to meet our obligations we shall be obliged to raise taxes. A bill will be presented to parliament at the next session. Good. Good. I trust the bill will pass successfully. I'm sure,your eminence,with your guiding hand it will be so. At least our alliance with the emperor is popular. Although I sometimes ask myself, why that should be so? Because he's not french! Right. The new warship is commissioned at portsmouth. Mm hm. I forgot to mention to your majesty. We have a new visitor at court, princess marguerrite of navarre. I received her myself yesterday. I found her a very beautiful young woman, with a very sweet, and yielding,disposition. She confessed a great admiration for your majesty. Should I arrange...? Yes. Yes do it! - With your majesty's permission, I intend to appoint a new secretary, instead of mr. Pace. Yes! We're gonna have fun in lisbon,boys! The whores are the best in the world. Even if you can't understand a word they say. They don't talk to me. They always have their mouths full! - There you are,your grace. My king has your queen. - Well,I was rather hoping that the knave would get the queen. Eminence. Your majesty. May I present princess marguerrite of navarre. Madame. Majeste. You are visiting here? Oui,majeste. The count,my husband, had to stay behind in france,regrettably. Indeed. Very regrettable,madame. But you must be compensated. You must enjoy some pleasures whilst here. I have some news, which may interest your grace. The bishop of winchester died 6 months ago. Mm hm. Winchester is the richest parish in england. Wolsey is supposed to appoint his successor. And he just did. He appointed himself. - How much more wealth does that man want? - There's more. - Tell me! - It appears that he's been using some of the king's money to invest his new college in oxford, and his own personal foundation. He closes down the worst monasteries, strips them of their assets, as he is supposed to do but instead of transferring all the profit to the privy purse, he makes all the profits disappear. God. You must tell the king. Right away. Forgive me,your grace, but we must judge the time,exactly. Such is wolsey's hold over the king that, whatever the evidence against him,the king won't believe it. But there will come a point. When the king's belief in his minister will hang in the balance and then,your grace we shall drop our truth into the scales and the scales will fall. Dear thomas! Majesty. Come and stay at court. I need you. I'll give you great chambers. Compton has great chambers. You can have his! Much as I love your majesty, I like my chambers to have my family inside them. Indeed. His majesty loves you above anyone else, mr. More,you know that. That may be true. And yet,if my head were to win him a castle in spain, I think he would cut it off. Mr. Wyatt. Your majesty. I hear you're a poet. Oh. I write poems. I don't know how to be "a poet. " I've read some. I like them. My lord,I don't know what to say. Were you in love with anne boleyn? I... cardinal wolsey tells me you were once engaged. No! That's not true. Did you love her? Lady anne is so beautiful it is the duty of every man to love her. Of course I loved her but from a distance. Personally,I have a wife. Enjoy the feast. Thomas? Thomas tallis! Hello. We just wanted to say we love your music. Thank you. We share a room. Do you want to come back with us? I want to finish this song. But finish it tomorrow. I'll have forgotten it by tomorrow. And you'll forget us,too. Compton,my friend, what do you think of princess marguerrite de navarre? She's well built your majesty. Little heavy in the top decks for my taste though. She's francis' sister. I happen to know that. Mm hm... oh,majeste. Ah,majeste. C'est ?A. C'est ?A. Ouu,ahh. - Ah,mon dieu,henri. - Mon dieu, henri. C'est fini. Happy to take your money anytime or place. You should save your money captain, for when we get to lisbon. Good night. Out of the way. Make way. Make way. A messenger from the emperor, your majesty. Well?! What is it? The emperor has won a great victory against the french. What are you saying? At the battle of pavia, 5 days ago, the emperor's army totally overcame those of the french. The french army was destroyed. My god! Is this true?! Not only that! The french king himself was also captured on the battlefield. Francis? King francis was captured?! Yes,your majesty. He's now the emperor's prisoner. - You are as welcome here as the angel gabriel. Feed yourself! Great news! We must celebrate! Come! Attack! Point to mr. Anthony knivert! Well done,tony! I tell you,william. I will be called a knight today, or I never will be. His majesty,the king. My queen. My lord. - Hoorah for his majesty! - My lady. Godspeed,your majesty! You see how popular the queen is with the people. She is the daughter of isabela and ferdinand. Perhaps the people think she is what a queen ought to be. Mr. William compton takes his majesty's challenge! You seem out of sorts today. I have reasons to be downcast and pained. But they needn't bother you. Why should we not have pains? Some people think we ought to go to heaven in feather beds! But that is not the way. The lord himself went there in pain and tribulation. Not that I'm suggesting that you're like that. Of course. Are you ready? I was born ready william. Attack! A point for his majesty the king! Do not look at me. I ask you privately to do something for me. Take this letter to the emperor. You will do this for me and not show it to anyone nor speak a word about it. Again! Attack! Two points for his majesty. "I was distressed you would not accept the brooches. They were made for you, not for anyone else. And why are you not worthy when I deem you so? For certain,it must be plain to you now that I desire to find a place in your heart-" wait! Give it to me! Give it. Desire to find a place in your heart and your grounded affection. Grounded affection? Grounded. Tell me at least that we can meet in private. I mean nothing more than a chance to talk to you. I beg you, come back to court soon. Come... give it back,brother. And meanwhile,accept this new gift and wear it,for my sake. What gift? And where is it? Oh holy jesus! Bring it here,lads. When will you bring my niece back to court? Soon,I think. Now the king's appetite is whetted. What's this? Just a trick,your majesty. Just a trick. - His majesty,the king and mr. Anthony knivert! - Lance. - A plaisance! Ready?! Lance. Yeah! The king's forgotten his visor. Hold! Hold! Hold! The king! The king! Hold! Majesty! Your majesty! - I'm not hurt! - Let me see. It's not your eyes,thank god. - A cloth to me! Okay. See! See?! Majesty! Will you forgive me? Will you? It's not your fault anthony! It's all my fault! It's my fault! You didn't hurt me. You can't hurt me. - No! Try it again! Henry. Henry. Madam, have no fear. I intend to ride again and prove to everyone here that I'm well and unharmed. If you insist,but I would much rather you did not. My lady. Arm yourself! Yes. Are you ready for me anthony? People of england, your king is unharmed! Lance! Is he breathing? Get a physic! Knivert! Anthony! Anthony. You want to see me, your highness? Only to ask how much longer we must be at sea? With a fair wind,2 more days. Do you play cards,your grace? Sometimes... your highness. What game shall we play? You choose. French ruff. You pick trumps. Kings. How appropriate your highness. Wine? As you please. Your highness must be looking forward with great anticipation to your wedding? I hear the king was a great horseman... in his time. And famous for his beautiful mistresses. Don't tease me. I don't like it. Will you like it when an old man tries to make love to you? Your grace goes too far. Already. - Gospel says the truth will make you free. Now you are blasphemous! My poor ladies should not hear you! My lady. - My lady. - My lady. I want you to leave. Do you? Yes. Now. Pity. I had a winning hand. Send a message to the emperor. Tell him of our joy and contentment at his great victory at pavia, and his capture of the french king. Yes,your majesty. Ask him what he intends to do with francis. And whether or not, with francis captive, it may not be a good time to think about striking france itself? Tell him we have gold, men and ships at his disposal, and are eager to do battle and share some of his glory. Yes,I shall. Ah! Your majesty. This is your new secretary. This is thomas cromwell. He is a trained barrister, a diligent man and a scholar. I think he'll be very useful for your majesty. Mr. Cromwell. Ladies. You're back at court. May I see you privately? Sweetheart. Le roi! Le roi! Comment ?a va? Tr?s bien,ma petite. Et toi? Comme ?I... comme ?a! My lady. Why does wolsey open my letters? Am I not the queen of england? - You sure he does? - I am sure. Then i shall stop it. Cardinal wolsey can be too zealous. But it is always in our interest. Unless you have secrets! Mr. Anthony knivert. Anthony. Majesty. You almost lost an eye. Never use that one much anyway. Kneel. I dub thee sir anthony knivert. Arise sir anthony and be recognized. Mr. William compton. Why so reproving a look,sir anthony? Your majesty,I nearly lost an eye for the same report. Ah! But you never carried a tree. William! Kneel. So that is why it is to be understood that the pope, far from being a descendant of st. Peter, is a sinner,a hypocrite, a handmaiden to the devil, and the living anti-christ on earth! This is what luther teaches us, in order to free us from false worship and false idols. In order that we might return to the true religion and take the true and fruitful path to salvation! Our message of hope, of liberty,of truth is already spreading throughout europe, from one corner to the other. Here in england, we have planted a seed that will, with prayer,with action, and perhaps even with sacrifice, grow one day to become a great tree whose branches will over-reach the kingdom and destroy the putrid monastic houses of the anti-christ! And this tree... this tree will be called the liberty tree. And in its branches all the angels of the lord will sing... - hallelujah. - Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I have dreamt of this moment a long time. Anne, you must know I desire you with all my heart. The young man you were dallying with earlier? Who was he? My brother george. Her majesty expects me. Later. Who was that, your majesty? Just a girl. Your new kingdom. The king must be looking forwa- don't! I forbid you. I should hate you. But you don'T. I know you don'T. What will I do? ROYAL PALACE LISBON Save me. Margaret... YOU ARE EVEN MORE HANDSOME THAN YOUR PORTRAIT. I FEEL SO GREATLY FORTUNATE, THAT YOU ARE SOON TO BE MY QUEEN. EVERTHING HERE IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL. I ONLY WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY. AND TO MAKE ME HAPPY. AND THEN WE WILL MAKE CHILDREN, MANY CHILDREN... WITH GODS HELP! What are you doing? What the king ordered! Perhaps you don't understand. But I can't sleep, I can hardly breathe, for thinking of you. Your image is before my eyes every waking second. I almost believe that I would for an hour in your arms... I beg you, name some place that we can meet,and when where I can show you truly an affection which is beyond a common affection. Written with the hand of your servant,henry. Now he is your servant. With some subtle care and the lure of your flesh, he may become something even closer. ***** Amen. Did his majesty...? Hold! What is it? Ground's too boggy. We're gonna have to go around. Says who? We can't jump this ditch,your majesty. You mean you can't jump this ditch. Flag pole! Majesty? Yes,sir anthony? What are you doing? I'm going to vault this stupid ditch. Nothing stands in the way of me and my sport. Are you sure? Just watch and see what the king of england can do. Oh! Your majesty! - Fetch a physician! Quickly! With your majesty's permission, may I dance with your wife? When do you leave? Tomorrow. You can'T. Why can't I? I've discharged my duty. Why should I stay? You have a life to lead. It's strange. Some men who seem at the peak of health, who still are young and full of life suddenly collapse and die. By that same counter, some old men, whose bodies look worn out, whose race seems run... they can go on for years. Don't you think it's strange? Do you tease me because it amuses you? Why else? Because you love me. Your majesty. Your majesty. We would like to bleed you,a little. To drain away the bile which is causing your majesty so much pain. With your permission? Yes. I almost died. Yes,your majesty. No not "yes,your majesty. " I almost died! Don't you understand? Since that moment,I've done a great deal of thinking. What if I had died? What would I have left? I have no heir only a daughter and a bastard son. You understand,wolsey? The tudor dynasty... gone! All my father's work,finished! And it's my fault. I have lived too long for pleasure. I never even thought of the future! I married my brother's wife and god has punished me! I've been such a fool. Now everything has changed. Everything. I want a divorce. And you will get one for me. - =www. ydy. com/bbs=- proudly presents sync:YTET-cflily - =www. ydy. com/bbs=-  THE TUDORS Season 01 Episode 04 Support us and become VIP member  to remove all ads from OpenSubtitles.org
