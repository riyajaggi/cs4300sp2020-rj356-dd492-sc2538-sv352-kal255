 Previously on "Frontier"... I believe that you've been
entertaining Declan Harp I haven't seen Declan Harp in years. Grace, I need information. - Does he work for you?
- What did he do? Attacked the Lake Walker village. Lake Walkers, shooting from the forest. As long as I am Okimaw, I will not allow you people near us. Show me. It's very wise of you,
Sir, sending an emissary.

 The lake Walkers will come
around. I'm optimistic. Optimistic? Yes, Sir. We'll get
things back on track. And what of the Scots,
the French, Harp's lot?! Still poaching our trade! If we had the vaguest
notion where their camps are, we could march on them,
start weeding them out. Sir, we have spotted
a sail on the horizon, a company ship approaching. A company ship? You're sure? Yes, Sir. Looks like a Navy frigate. Why would the company send a
ship this late in the season? Synced by Aaronnmb, corrected by louvette

 We'll meet you in the town. Why are we going to fort James? Why do we not return to the
Lake Walkers and fix this? Because Machk is a fanatic
and will never be our ally. I disagree. He sees you as a
European, as a threat, Harp. I should go talk to him.
I can gain his trust. Dimanche, Machk would kill you. Things have changed.
We have lost our army, so we deal with Benton ourselves. So that's why we're going to Fort James? Benton's surrounded by soldiers. Then we will kill his soldiers and then we will kill him. You're serious? He has eighty armed men.
There are only four of us. Even with our entire company... Go get our men and
meet me in fort James. In spring, more ships will
arrive full of Redcoats. This is a battle that can't be won. Not necessarily. A strike at the heart of the
company would send a message that we are a serious threat, that the company's vulnerable. When did this boy become one of us? We don't know him. He could
slit our throats in our sleep. You going to slit our throats, Michael? Well, you never know. This obsession you have with Benton, it got Samoset killed. It will get us killed! Harp! I'm done! I'm taking the men with me! Mr. Grant? Mr. Grant is indisposed. I'll wait. You speak to me. Why would I speak to
you about my business? I had the police around. They were asking about
Carruthers, how he died. - I told them it was self-defense.
- It was self-defense. You killed the man in cold blood. Well, he drew on me first. Is Grant plannin' to murder
all of the competition? This is no way to do business. We have news from up north... regarding your brothers. - What about them?
- Hmm... Brother Cedric... well, he's dead. The result apparently of a
drunken brawl in Fort James. Who told you this? Some foul little voyageur recently returned from the Frontier. - I do not believe it.
- Oh, there's more. Brother Malcolm has gone to war. Instead of wooing the lake
Walker tribe, he's fighting them. Lies. Malcolm would never
jeopardize our business. I hope that's true for your sake. Because if that is true and he is failing to secure
the Lake Walker trade... well, my friend, there's a very serious problem for you. And you saw firsthand how I deal with our problems. Oh, there's a woman, um... Mr. Grant would like you to
speak to Carruthers' widow. Yeah, his operation is small,
but it's very lucrative. Mr. Grant would like
to make her an offer. First he kills the man, then he takes his company. Well, it's just good business. It's a relief, isn't it? That moment you set foot
again on solid ground. You're Captain Chesterfield, I suppose? I am. And you are? Captain Benedict Johnson. I was expecting to be met
at the jetty by lord Benton. We weren't lookin' for a ship,
not this late in the season. You're lucky you beat the ice. Nor was I looking to make the voyage, however circumstances have
forced my urgent deployment to this miserable place. Circumstances? I must speak with Lord
Benton straightaway. Regardin' what, exactly? I have orders from
London, the head office, to be discussed with Lord Benton, not his subordinate. Well, you'll see him tonight at dinner. In the meantime, his subordinate will
buy you a fucking drink. - The town is...
- ... This way. I assume there's a place of
worship here in Fort James? Aye, the ale house.
We're headed right for it. Sit there, table by the fire. - From the frigate?
- Name's Johnson. Came out of fuckin' nowhere
with a stick up his ass. - Asked me where the church was.
- Jesus Christ. Why is a senior officer suddenly
showing up in Fort James unannounced? Ah, don't worry. I
can handle this prick. Go on, by the fire. I'll be right there. Well, the prick is leaving. Ah, where is he goin'? Fuck me! Can I trust you? Of course you can trust me. It's gonna be dangerous in Fort James. I know. And your girl, Clenna? When the spring comes and
a ship departs for England, will you be on it? You have a decision to make. It's a shame you won't
be able to stay long, if you're going to make it back
to England before the ice comes. A fortnight, I imagine. I should think it was hardly worth
your while coming all this way. Game, is it? Caribou. It's rather tough, but quite delicious, don't you think? Lord Fisher sends his regards, although I think he was rather surprised at your hasty departure from London, and without proper authorization. Nonsense. Fisher had full knowledge of my plans. It seems you are misinformed, Captain. In any case, Lord Fisher is anxious
to hear of your progress. He has asked for a full report. Has he indeed? Mmm. What strides have
you made in your dealings with the Montreal
upstarts, with Declan Harp, the inland wars, the natives? Have you, for example, increased profits via an expansion of trade? You may count yourself lucky, Johnson. You will be able to paint an
entirely rosy picture on your return. This man literally saved the company! Lord Fisher should throw
him a fucking parade! I admit I was rather taken
aback at the state of the town. I do hope you are providing
a proper Christian example in this new world? The ale house, for instance, rather disturbing. But crucial for morale. It's a common error. You have just arrived in
the New World, Captain. You'll learn. You've been very kind, but I must see to my men. Uh, I'll bring the girl
ashore in the morning. Oh yes? Clenna Dolan. You sent word about her? Yes, of course. Thank you for dinner. I'll keep my eye on that one. Do not provoke him or his men. And I want the girl
here in the residence. Have her brought over. - Tonight?
- No. Bring her through the town. Make sure she's well observed. Word of her presence will soon travel. Let's see if the sugar
attracts any wasps. What we need is information. How many Redcoats,
where they're stationed. The garrison then, by
the governor's house. We'll get a head count, their routine, when they're most
likely to be surprised. How exactly are we going to kill them? We are only three. Gunpowder. Gunpowder? How much? Ten barrels. - Where will we get it?
- Leave that to me. We'll meet at the ale
house, back entrance. Make sure you're not seen. The Redcoats know your faces.
If they see you they will shoot. Garrison's that way. Good luck. Let's go. I require lodging for my men. They'll not be on that
ship another night. I've found you something
at the edge of town. It's a former stable.
It's not the cleanest, could be a little drafty in this
weather, but you'll make it work. Not acceptable. You will find room here with your men. We may be of equal rank, Johnson, but I am in command here and you report to me, and you'll be garrisoned wherever
the fuck I say you'll be garrisoned. You will also give me
access to company ledgers and a key to the company storehouse, as Lord Fisher has requested. That means now, Captain. All of my efforts, my struggles... pursued by bloodthirsty Frenchmen, captured and tortured... by Declan Harp, what a bast... They have been a test, do you see? God... has been leading
me to a kind of epiph... epiph... epiphany of sorts. Which is what, Father? Oh, you sweet flower. What is wine if not joy? And what is joy if not God? Ergo... that's Latin... therefore... wine is surely god! This is my church! This ale house, here I stand. I can do no more. And these miserable sinners... are my congregation. In the back. I need the company ledger. Where is it? - What's happened?
- Did you fix it? Show me what you did. This column records the incoming pelts. I made changes here, here. Nothing that would draw attention. Johnson's doin' an inventory. He's in the company storehouse
right now counting pelts. - Why?
- Orders from London he says. Lord Benton is out of favor. Oh, why else would the
company send someone? They're lookin' for an
excuse to sack Benton. This could be a disaster. You have to be the next
governor here, not this Johnson! Oh, trust me, that arrogant fuck... isn't sackin' anyone! Captain Johnson will sail
before the bay freezes over, and if he doesn't I'll
cut his fuckin' throat. I've got a job for you. This new man, Johnson, you're gonna pay him a visit. Ma'am, when I first came here, you said this wasn't a whorehouse. And it's not. You don't sleep with
anyone if you don't want to, but he doesn't need to know that. I need you to lure him back here. Why? Captain Johnson is a religious man. I'm gonna use that against him. Don't scream. Don't scream. You tryin' to scare me to death? We need to talk. "A full inventory." His very words, by the
order of Lord Fisher! He's in the storehouse
right now countin' pelts! He wants to see the ledgers. Send them over. We shall allow this Captain Johnson to play his game for now. And the girl? Young Clenna? She's on her way, Sir, as we speak. Middle of the night. We come out of the forest
and we work quietly. Three, maybe four barrels of gunpowder. That should be enough. We place them at the
back behind the tents, there out of sight. Can I ask you somethin'? Do you think we're mad taking
on Lord Benton and the HBC? Scared? No. Sort of, ya. You should be. You're terrible at fighting. You'll be the first to die. Then I guess you'll have
to train me, won't ya? Mmm, take too much time. You know, you've a really
dark fuckin' sense of humor, and I can't decide if
I hate it or if like it. This way, love, come on. Christ Almighty! I can't believe it.
They brought her over! Who? Clenna! I have to go. Michael! Oh, my dear, there's
no reason to be afraid. Oh, have you been
mistreated on the voyage? Oh, you poor, dear girl. Well, see here, look what I've brought you. Go on. Plenty more downstairs in the kitchen. You must help yourself. It gets cold in this room at night, but you have plenty of
furs to keep you warm, and we shall find you a bath
and some clean clothes, yes. And in return? I know about men like you, you take what you want
from girls like me. Good heavens, no! Well, I simply enjoy
the company of women. If they are young and lovely then so much the better. So, you will dine with me tonight, and nothing more. You are my guest and
under my protection. With any luck you may even
see your young man again. Michael? Is he, is he here?! I'm afraid not, my dear. He's been captured by
a savage, Declan Harp. He's in terrible danger. I fear for his life. But if he learns you've
arrived in the New World, you may just be the
key to his salvation. Hmm. See you at dinner. Captain Johnson? I saw you earlier at the ale house. May I come in? I
brought you some supper. I heard you were a
religious man. I admire that. I didn't bring you
wine or ale, just water. I think you'll find it quite refreshing. Very kind. Thank you. Good heavens, have you been
lifting all those bales? You must be in excellent health. You certainly look to be. I... yes. In my previous life back in London I knew lots of soldiers, but I never met one quite as
endowed with your immense gifts. I'll do anything you want, Captain, anything you can imagine... That's enough! I am a man of God, and an officer in the British army! Please. Go. Now! His name's Johnson. He arrived with a company of soldiers, unexpectedly as far as I can tell. So altogether... In the garrison? Well, over a hundred men. I need gunpowder. Ten barrels, maybe more. Why? I was gonna throw you a party but now you've ruined it. Gracie, I need this. Harp, I run an ale house. What the hell do I know about gunpowder? Every thief and black marketeer comes
to Fort James to drink and boast... here. I need a name. Ten barrels of gunpowder? Maybe more. What are you thinkin'? Are you gonna attack the garrison? I'm not going to tell you 'cause
I don't want to put you in danger. Fine! Then I'm not gonna help you. And there's the door! Declan, how long have you known me?! Seven years? Eight? When your wife and son were... you spent weeks upstairs in that room. You wouldn't eat. I fed you brandy. Declan... it's time you started to trust me. Every minute of every day... you dream about killing Lord Benton. You lie awake at night
thinkin' how you might do it. First you'd slit him open, down the front, while he's still alive, still breathin'. Then you'd gut him, his lungs would still be inflating, his heart still beating. He'd be screaming for mercy. Am I close? Yes. And you think that'll
make you feel better? That it'll bring you peace? It will bring me peace. Excuse me, Ma'am. What is it? There's somebody at the back
door asking for Mr. Harp. She's at the back of the house. There's a window. We could get her out, just the three of us, quick and easy! - You're sure it was Clenna?
- Yes, I'm sure. - We saw her.
- She's not safe there! I betrayed Lord Benton for you. He'll punish her for that! We have to get her out! And what happens then? An Irish city girl with us in the wild? - She wouldn't last a day.
- I did! I'm askin'. Do it for me. Not tonight. Both of you go back to the garrison, you keep watch. - Harp, I know...
- Michael... you said I could trust you. He's gonna go after her. Let him. He'll come back to us. Michael Smyth would die for you! I'll make it happen, the gunpowder. Just get me the silver. Thank you. There's one condition... you tell me the truth. Whatever you're plannin',
I want to know about it. You see that girl up there? Yeah, she ain't half bad. - Shh shh!
- Michael, is that you?! Are you all right? Are you all right? I saw you on the road. I couldn't believe me eyes. I thought you were still in London. I thought of you every
day, Clenna, every minute. I dreamed of you, I dreamed of you. Me too, I, I... I thought I'd never see you again. We can't stay here. We have to go. Well, did anyone see you come in?! - No.
- Then what's the rush? They're all sleeping.
Nobody knows you're here. Where have you been sleepin'? You stink like sweat and smoke, and God knows what. Take off your clothes! Like I said. Filthy. He's actually been brilliant. He's given me all this,
whatever I want, he says. At dinner he was a total gentleman. I keep waitin' for him to
turn up in his nightshirt, but it hasn't happened yet. I promise you, Clenna,
you can't trust him. What did he tell ya? That you'd been captured by Harp. That he's a terrible savage, and that you'd been
seduced by the devil. We're not safe here. You need to get dressed
and we have to go! Go where exactly? Out there? Lord Benton's been lying to you. I'll explain it all later. Michael, I'm not going out there. There's wolves out there. What? Wolves. Lord Benton told me about
them. I heard them howling. You're asleep! You're asleep! Not a sound. Tomorrow, meet me in the forest! Take the path behind the house. Michael, wait! If Benton finds me here he'll kill me, and God knows what would happen to you. Meet me in the forest. Don't break your legs. You're really quite lovely. Hello, Michael Smyth. Madame Carruthers, I'm sorry for your loss. Mr. Brown. You've come to pay your
respects... to pray? Your husband was a good man. I-I was there when
it happened, you know. I have a message from Samuel Grant. He wishes to speak with you
about your husband's business. Was it not Grant's man
that pulled the trigger? Aye, it was. He feels badly. His only wish is to meet
with you, that's all. Truthfully, Mr. Brown, I didn't care much for my husband. He was a wretched man. It's a relief he's gone. Now I can run the business properly. You tell your Mr. Grant
that if he wants my company he'll have to murder me too. Elizabeth. What's he got over you, Mr. Brown? It must be substantial for
you to come to the funeral and prey on the widow. I need your help with Captain Johnson. I tried to tempt him
but he wouldn't bite. I thought maybe if there were two of us. Is that what you thought? I know you don't like me, Mary, but I'm not goin' anywhere. We might as well work together. Okay. Never mind. It's better if I go alone. You played the whore
and it didn't work, so... let's try the virgin. Captain Johnson? - You are?
- Mary, Sir. I brought you some meat pie and cider. I hope you weren't offended... by the other girl, I mean. She can be very forward. It's hardly appropriate, especially
for a Christian man like yourself. That's quite all right. She won't stop talking about you, how handsome you are. She's quite indecent. I'll be back for the
plates after my prayers, or, if you like, bring them
yourself to the ale house. Miss Emberly is very particular. What was your name again? Mary, Sir. Mary, let's not interrupt your prayers. I'll see you later then, at the ale house. That'd be wonderful. God bless you. And God bless you. The letter is for Mister Grant. As you can see, the seal is unbroken. Ah, ah, no, no! It's, it's not for you. It's for Mr. Grant. Shh, I'm reading. Mister Grant was uh, no doubt,
expecting me to arrive with Declan Harp. It's a troubling story. I go back to the north.
Where is he? Nowhere! I'm not happy about him. Grace Emberly? Oh, oui, Monsieur. She operates the ale house. A beautiful woman. Also a shrewd woman. Good with business. Uh, whatever she says
there I... I don't know, she doesn't tell me,
but you may believe it. What is it exactly that she says? We have been receiving a
lot of news from the north. Brown Brothers, the Lake Walkers. It's a very chaotic place it seems. Well, you know what
they say, Monsieur... "In chaos lies opportunity", hmm? And I suppose Declan Harp is
taking advantage of this chaos. Who can say? Declan Harp is a crazy person. He comes, he goes. What he is thinking or doing? Pfft, who knows? I'm going to give Mr. Grant this letter and he's gonna want to
compose a reply, I'm sure, and you can take that
back to Miss Emberly? Oh, you want me to go to the north? But I just arrive. You'll leave tonight, Monsieur. I was thinking maybe a soft
bed, a good steak?! No?! He's coming! Captain. I'm a... returning the plate. Thank you. If you don't mind just
bringing it right through here. I'll just be a moment. Good work, both of you. Now get him into a
compromising position, but be careful. I'll take that. Kind of you to return it. Captain Johnson, I have a confession. Please. Since we spoke, before
I've been feeling very... peculiar. The thoughts in my head are... sinful. Extremely sinful and
I feel very ashamed. Do you ever have thoughts like this? upon occasion. the flesh is... tempting. What do you do, Captain, when the temptation's... overwhelming... and it fills you entirely? We, uh, we must pray... together. Father! My son, what are you...? Oh. Oh ho ho oh, disgusting! Mary, out now! I don't know where you think you are, but this is a decent establishment for good Christian people! It is not a whorehouse. That woman, she seduced me! Oh, don't embarrass yourself, Captain, I know exactly what happened here and I know exactly who you are. You're a sinner. A wretch. Trust me. You do not
want to take me on, Sir. You'll keep this to yourself? I will, for now. And I will take care of Father Coffin. You may go. The priest was a nice touch. Yeah, poor Captain Johnson.
He looked quite mortified. Go on back to work, both of you. Rumor has it... the Cree are at odds
with Harp and his men. And the emissary we sent with gifts, Corporal Lockington? They dumped him there, burnt to death. Not a pleasant one by the looks of it. Apparently there's a new
chief of the Lake Walkers. - Indeed.
- And apparently, he doesn't fucking like us. Well, we'll have to march on them. In winter. Bloody hell! Oh, what a vision of loveliness! - Sorry to interrupt.
- Not at all, my dear. I trust you slept well? You said I could go
for a walk? Some air? Yes, of course. We'll get you some furs
and someone to escort you. I don't need an escort. I won't be goin' far. I
can take care of me self. I don't doubt it for a moment, but to be careful. There are many dangers in the forest. It isn't safe. Mary mother of God, I have never been so cold in my life! - What, what are you doin'?!
- They'll be following you. - Shh! They'll be following you.
- Why would they... why would they follow me? 'Cause you're coming to
me and Benton knows that! - Wait, Michael, stop!
- Shh! You've got it all wrong. Lord Benton is a good man. He promised that we could
go home to London together. He talked about a job
for you with the company. - No Clenna.
- It's everything we talked about. A better life together,
you said so yourself. - It's all lies.
- No, it isn't! He told me you might say that. Wha... He wants to help us. No, you have to trust me, Clenna. Everything Benton said
is a lie. We have to go! Stop, stop! Last time I followed you, Michael, my brother ended up dead... and I ended up in prison, and then on a horrible ship, in chains for weeks, freezing cold and starving and surrounded by filthy men with their rotting teeth
and their stinking breath and all so I could end up here in this horrible frigid place! So no... I don't think I will
follow you this time! What happened to you, Michael? I don't recognize ya. I want to go home to London. I'm not goin' any
further into this madness! Clenna. We've already waited too long. Let's go. He has made his choice, Sokanon. I didn't think you'd still be here. What happened? Benton's been feeding her lies.
I couldn't convince her to leave. Are you with us? I am. Good. It's not safe here. Let's make
camp outside of town. Let's go! - Soldiers coming.
- They followed you! Come on. This way. We need him alive! Good luck with that. Hold your fire! Do not shoot! Go, Michael! Go! Run! Lock the gates quickly! Please, Declan! By order of Lord Benton,
Governor of Fort James, Declan Harp, you are under arrest.
