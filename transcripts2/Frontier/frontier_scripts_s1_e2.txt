 [Wagon wheels creak] Malcolm: So we make a deal with this Lake Walker tribe, then what? We canna handle that kind of volume. We haven't got the men for it. - The men can be purchased. - What with? When our ship sunk it took all of our capital with it... ten thousand pelts. We donna have a pot to piss in! He makes a good fuckin' point there, Douglas. Douglas: There is a new man in town, an American Samuel Grant. He's rich and he's hungry. We approach him. - Malcolm: An investor? - Aye! We tell him we're about to secure the Lake Walker trade.

 Malcolm: It's just more fuckin' debt! I'd rather pull up stakes and go back to Scotland than jump into some ill-thought-out new fuckin' scheme! I agree. He's fuckin' right! Douglas: Malcolm, Cedric, we're bankrupt! We owe thousands to our creditors. We could be thrown in prison at any moment. We cannot just walk away. Who's gonna fuckin' stop us? Huh? I donna like it either, but we're up against it. We have to make a move right now or the Low River Company is finished. Cedric can leave tomorrow for the north, make contact with the Lake Walkers. If we establish trade with them, this could make us richer than we ever imagined. - [Breathing hard] - [Twigs snap, brush rustles] [Pounding footsteps] [Grunts with effort, breathing hard] [Twigs snap, brush rustles] [Breathing hard] [Grunts with effort, breathing hard] - [Twig snaps] - [Panting] - [Violent thud] - [Grunts] [Growls] [Angry grunt] _ _ _ _ [Grunt] [Chuckles] _ _ [Gunshot booms, blood splatters] - [Gasps in pain] - [Heavy thump] [Brush rustles] - [Gunshot booms] - [Grunts in pain] - [Violent punch] - [Hard thump] [Grunting pants] You wee shit.

Have mercy on a poor priest! - Maybe just a drop of wine? - [Hard slap] Ah! Just a minute! Wait, no, no! No! He's sufferin'... lack of drink. If you kill him you'd just be doing him a favor. I told ya, I'm here to make my fortune. I have many skills. I'm a quick learner. I can help ya. You wouldn't hurt a fellow Irishman, would you? Do I look like an Irishman to you? I was told your father was. Harp: Were you told I was raised by a Cree mother? Michael: Whatcha doin' there? Can't rush a thing like this, skin won't peel right, ruins the hide. - [Metal clanks] - Oh Jesus! I've told you everythin'. I swear, the truth! [Panicky breathing] What's your connection with Lord Benton? Nothin'. I told ya I came over on his ship. He hates your guts. That's all I know, that's... [skin sizzles, pained shout] All right! I made a deal with him! I made a deal with him! He made me an offer, he said, he said I needed to come find ya, Declan Harp he said, and he said I had to tell him where you were and how many people was here. And what did he tell you about me? That you worked together. That you had a disagreement. That you've become wild. And he offered you what? Money? Land? [Gasps] There's a girl! There's a girl! I love her. Her name is Clenna. Benton said he'd hang her if I didn't do it. [Fire crackles] What, what are you doin'? What are you doin'? - [Loud slice] - [Gasps, pants] You trust Benton's word your girl's as good as dead. I hope you paddle better than you lie.

You do not entertain these men. You serve them food and drink, is that clear? - Clear. - And you listen, carefully, every word, every conversation. - Miss Emberly... - I want to know what's being said and who said it. I will reward you for every piece of information... Miss Emberly, it's Captain Chesterfield. [Shuffling footsteps] [Patrons talk loudly] Whiskey. Double. Good Lord. Come to the back. [Shuffling footsteps] [Water splashes] - [Grimaces] - Keep still. [Sighs] What the hell happened to you? [Swallows] Didn't see. Struck from behind. Three good men murdered. [Grimaces, sighs] You've been living in the safety of London too long. Getting careless. Mind your words, woman! And the boy? Michael? He's gone. Likely dead. [Water splashes] I don't imagine Lord Benton will be too happy to hear about all this. [Hard slap] Watch it! And what of our drunken governor, Mr. Threadwell? He must be feeling the pressure with Lord Benton's arrival. I expect Threadwell will be on the next ship bound for England. Leaving a vacancy that needs to be filled. Don't move your head. It occurs to me that... with my help you could make an excellent governor. And you would stand to gain what? A business partner. There, finished. I could have done this myself. That's the idea. You should go. If Lord Benton finds out that you stopped for a drink on your way back you'll get worse than a scalp wound. [Liquor sloshes] Give that partnership some thought. Benton: You've had a rough go of it, Threadwell, that's more than clear. Ah, well, the winters, my Lord. Very harsh, longer than anticipated, colder... Yes, indeed. Threadwell: The French and the natives have been plaguing us, but I would say we've acquitted ourselves rather well under the circumstances. And you will be rewarded properly for your work here, I will personally see to it. In the meantime, I've arranged for a cabin for you here on the ship. Threadwell: But I have my residence on the outskirts of town. - I'd be much more comfortable there, thank you. - [Door opens] I'm afraid I have to insist. Now just one moment. You'll be quite comfortable. [Gasps] How dare you?! You have no right! Benton! You will regret this! Unhand me! I say! Benton, unhand me! Unhand me now! How dare you?! Captain Chesterfield, it seems you stand before me empty-handed. Sir... I was ambushed, my men murdered. A decorated English captain. Pathetic. I suspect the boy's being eaten by wolves as we speak, but perhaps not. If by some miracle he's managed to stay alive, you may yet have a chance to redeem yourself. Shall we? - [Loud crunching bang] - [Violent gurgling] For the past 100 years, we have dominated the rivers and shores of Hudson's Bay. Yet now we find ourselves challenged, losing territory, profits down, and unable to staunch the bleeding. The most powerful navy in the world run ragged by men in canoes. The Scots, the French, the murderous Declan Harp. You are officers of the Hudson's Bay Company and they have made fools of you gentlemen, every one of you! Isn't that so, Mr. Threadwell? I want two things: total domination, meaning our competitors crushed, our monopoly restored, and I want Declan Harp on this ship alive. Oh yes, how did Mr. Threadwell die? Anyone? He was depressed, Sir. Couldn't bear the trials of the new world. Took his own life, the coward. [Chuckles] Good. [Wheezy chuckle] Very good. [Water laps gently] Coffin: They're called the Black Wolf Company. They've been undercutting English businesses, murdering English soldiers. His men, who are they? Mostly metis and Scots. The woman is Ojibwe. The canoes are full of trade goods. My guess is we're on our way to the Lake Walkers. I suspect Harp wants their trade, along with everyone else. Do you think he's gonna kill us? I'm not optimistic, but I'm betting you'd go first. [Footsteps crunch on gravel] [Inhales sharply] Thank you kindly. Thank you. I'm starved. This is the tastiest piece of whatever this is I've ever tasted. What's your name? I'm Michael, Michael Smyth, but you probably know that already. Michael, take the hint, stop talking. [Fire crackles] Thanks for the food. Scares the... shit out of me, that one. I don't think she's the one you need to be worryin' about. [Fire crackles] [Muted chatter of patrons inside] [Patrons chatter and laugh loudly] [Liquor pours] Ma'am. [Cork pops, liquor sloshes] Do you never have one yourself? [Liquor flows] How did you come to be on that ship? [Liquor flows] Lord Benton plucked you from a London whorehouse? Made you part of his "staff"? My debt to Lord Benton is paid. [Cork squeaks] Don't be naive, girl, your debt will never be paid. Miss Emberly! There's something you need to see. Mind the bar. Mary: I was coming out to fetch a wheel of cheese and sausage, and when I got here the lock was broken. You're not gonna like what I found inside. [Lock clanks] [Singing drunkenly] ♪ hi ho dee... ♪ Cedric Brown! What the hell have you done, you drunken toe rag? Grace Emberly! You're a fucking goddess! Who's the boy? I'm securing me and my brothers' future. Do your brothers know what you've done? Na, but they're gonna be fuckin' proud of me. You fool, if this boy dies your brothers are gonna murder you! Look at his dress! Do you realize who he is?! Cedric: Damn right. He's Kitchi, grandson of the chief of the Lake Walkers. The wound's infected. Mary, deal with this. What am I supposed to do with him? Take him out, get him some coffee. - [Spits] - Come on then. [Bottle clank] Where are you taking me, ya pretty little thing? - [Door squeaks open] - Hold on there, laddie. [Door squeaks shut] [Birds chirp, sheep bleat] Emberly: His fever broke in the night. You got lucky, Cedric. Fuck that. He wasn't that bad. How do you possibly think this can help you? Cedric: Force the Lake Walkers to trade with us. Fear is stronger than trust in my experience. You're in for a rude awakening, you dolt. Cedric: Fuckin' terrible coffee. How about a little nip of somethin'? Emberly: I'd heard you were in collapse, you and your brothers, bankrupt. We're pursuing an investor. In Montreal? Cedric: Yeah. Where do you keep the Brandy? Is he a fellow Scot? An American. Rich as fuck, buckets of cash. Won't be long, you'll see. Brown Brothers back on top. [Liquor pours] Ah, that's my girl. Oh, don't be shy. [Liquor pours] And what's his name, this American? Oh. Samuel Grant. He's a wee bit of a cocksucker, but doesn't matter. Long as he fuckin' pays. [Swords clank] - Ah! - [Door squeaks open] [Swords clank] Butler: Monsieur, s'il vous plait, les frères Brown, Malcolm et Douglas, de la Low Rivière Companie. [Scoffs] That sounds a lot better when it's not in fuckin' French! - No offence. - [Door shuts] Mr. Grant, we appreciate you taking the time to see us. As you may know, Sir, we are highly successful procurers of beaver pelts from the wilderness. The Low River Company has a stellar track record... We're expanding, moving north to the Bay. We are on the brink of a stunningly lucrative trade agreement... with the Lake Walker people, the eastern Cree, who trade on behalf of further untold numbers of Cree to the west, and you need a buyer, someone who will receive your pelts. But gentlemen, I know you are in massive debt and are on the brink of total ruin. Moving pelts through the wilderness is very expensive. Portaging from waterway to waterway. Then of course you have to throw in the cost of trade goods, so you need more than a buyer. You need an investor. Cash, aye. Up front. That's why we're here. I thought there were three of you here in Montreal. - A brother, Cecil, is it? - Cedric. He's up north with the Lake Walkers. He's keeping them happy until... Until with your assurance, Mr. Grant, we can close this deal. And we can all get fuckin' rich! [Laughing] Grant: I hope he knows his business, your brother. There are many companies vying for Lake Walker trade and one wrong move... All he has to do is bring gifts and smile. He might be a bit thick, but he'll get the job done. I assume you've brought some sort of proposal? [Fingers strum] You saw him yourself? Yes, sir. Inside the storehouse there was a drunk Scottish man. - She called him Cedric. - Cedric Brown? He had a prisoner with him, a young native boy, Kitchi. I heard 'em say he was the grandson of the Lake Walker chief. Kneel. [Coin clinks] - [Bones crunch] - Imogen: [Grimaces in pain] You will continue, eyes and ears open. Yes, MiLord! [Gasps in pain] [Door opens and shuts] The grandson of the chief. The Lake Walkers despise us. Threadwell was cheating them and they are shrewd, but they also represent an enormous amount of trade. This boy would provide a superb incentive to restore ties and bring the company back real profit. Not to mention... It would no doubt piss off Declan Harp. You will be discreet. And Chesterfield, don't fail me again. ♪ ♪ [Door opens with a clattering bang] Where is he? Where's the boy?! What do you think you're doin'? - Take him. - You leave him be, he is sick! [Violent bang] You were going to keep this from me? Of course not. I was trying to protect him from the stupid Brown brothers. I wasn't hiding him from you or Benton. Now calm down. [Breathing hard] We need to work together, you and I. So why don't you leave boy in here, let me take care of him. [Door opens] [Door shuts] Cedric: What the fuck's goin' on? - Hello, Cedric. - I don't believe we've met. Who the fuck are you? - [Blade clinks, violent thrusts] - [Pained grunts] - [Wet knife slice] - [Choked gasps] - [Violent thud] - [Liquor splashes] [Dying shaky gasps] [Children giggle playfully] [Guns clatter] [Lanterns clink] Harp: We are honored to be here. These gifts extend our wishes for your prosperity. [Speaking Cree] You, you, come! Coffin: Jesus, I can't take this... [Breathing hard] The anticipation. Every breath I take I think that's it, that's the last one! The journey's over! If you're gonna kill us then kill us for the love of God! Michael: Ignore him. Nervous disposition, normally he'd be drunk. So these are the Lake Walkers? Samoset: The woman is Kamenna. She is Ookimaw. She executes the will of the people. Givin' her gifts is a sign of respect. You two are included. What's that now? Gifts? Coffin: Oh, Jesus Christ almighty God in heaven. The muskets that we brought are well made. Flints that won't freeze in the snow. You've been killing English soldiers. We hear you're consumed by a blood rage. I have enemies, yes, but I'm consumed by nothing. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ You have come a great distance, but now's not the time to be talking about trade. [Fire crackles] Have I offended you? Kamenna: No. [Distressed sigh] My grandson's been taken, his friend's been shot. By whom? [Grunts] Your grandson, what is his name? Kitchi. He's merely a boy. [Fire crackles] I will make you this promise, Okimaw: If he is alive, I will find him. I will bring him home to you. My word is good. Coffin: They're going to leave us here! God help us. They're actually gonna do it, they're gonna paddle off and leave us here! Just shut up! Samoset: It was Benton who did this, I'm sure of it. He's a fool. He thinks he can intimidate these people into trade. You think the boy's alive? He's no good to anyone dead. Samoset: I've seen the English do this before. Take a prisoner and then threaten to hang them to motivate trade negotiations. I don't think it was Benton. Dimanche: Be quiet, boy. No. Let him speak. All he thinks about is you, is killing you. How many other companies want to trade with the Lake Walkers? Any one of 'em could have taken the boy. Well, we're going to be the ones that find Kitchi. It's the only way to secure their trade. We're going to Fort James. Excellent choice! Right behind you. It seems you're still with us. [Patrons laugh and chatter loudly] - [Bottle clanks loudly] - Grace... [Fiddle playing, boisterous chatter and laughter] [Liquor pours, bottle thumps] He wasn't a friend of yours, I hope? Cedric? A friend, no. A customer, yes. Interesting approach you have to problem solving. - Does it offend you? - Quite the opposite. I respect a man whose actions are decisive. The boy's alive. He's being cared for. Is that what you came here to tell me? Or have you given our partnership some thought? What precisely do you have in mind? If I'm not mistaken, you control the movement of inventory, and when pelts come into the fort it's your responsibility to put them in lock-up. If, with each shipment, a couple of bundles of pelts were to be... diverted. How exactly does this lead to me becoming governor? Well, if you want to be in charge around here, you'll need money and plenty of it. And more importantly... You'll need to discredit Lord Benton in the eyes of London. Profits are dwindling. He's losing control of the company and the fort. You best be careful. If those words got back to Lord Benton, he'd murder you. As you know, there's one among you. Imogen. I'm aware. I can handle her. Of course you can. The native boy needs medicine. I'd see to that if I were you. Should we drink to it then? Later, perhaps. I'm workin'. [Slurps] [Cup thumps down] [Retreating footsteps] - Follow him. See where he goes. - [Door shuts] I want to know where he's taken the boy. ♪ ♪ [Fire crackles] Stay by the fire. Over here. [Door opens] [Patrons laugh and chatter loudly] [Door shuts] Emberly: Christ, Harp, it's not safe for you here. - I came to see you. - [Liquor pours] [Liquor pours] [Bottles clank] Come on. [Patrons laugh and chatter loudly] Grace, I need to talk to you. Where have you been? Look at you. I need information. Are you serious? I've not seen you in months. You give information to everyone else, now I need you to give me some. Not for nothin', I won't. - This was a mistake. - No, wait! Tell me why you're here. Declan... There's a Lake Walker boy named Kitchi. He was taken captive. Do you know anything about it? He was here a few nights ago. And? Well, his wounds were festerin'. I kept him hidden here, took care of him until his fever broke. And who brought him in? Cedric Brown. He stole the boy. Not Benton? No, Cedric first. Then Benton's man Chesterfield came along and took him. And where are they holdin' him now? Where's the boy? Declan, you can't keep chasing Benton. Where's the boy, Grace? Look, I know you've been through hell, but going after Benton is never gonna bring your wife back. Where is the boy? ♪ ♪ [Fire crackles] Last night, maybe? The night before? Truthfully, I have no precise knowledge of when it occurred or the cause. The fear perhaps, the lack of drink, first time I've been sober in seven months, but the point is, my young friend, a miracle has occurred! God has arrived in the wilderness and entered me! [Chuckling] I am full of the holy spirit! I am a new man! My sins are behind me, Michael. I am reborn. [Door opens] Brilliant. When does God tell you to shut up? - Man: [Grunts drunkenly] - [Liquor sloshes in bottle] Look at this poor soul now. This is my mission, right here! - My son! - Coffin! If I might speak to you! Samoset: Let him go. He won't be hard to find. [Door opens] They're back. Governor's house, edge of town. [Brush rustles quietly] That's where they're keeping the boy? Do we know where? What room? No. Samoset: Cellar maybe? He'll be tied up, under guard. How many soldiers? Ten, fifteen. - At least. - Look. [Door opens] [Lanterns clatter] We use knives. Go room by room, slit their throats as they sleep. Too dangerous. We're too outnumbered. We should wait, keep watch, see if we can catch a glimpse of Kitchi. - I have an idea. - Quiet, boy. No, go on. I walk through the front door. I'm returnin' from the wild, I'm there to see Lord Benton. I'll tell him that I've worked my way into your trust but I don't know much, and you're expecting me back in the morning. And in the meantime? I'm desperate for a proper bed and a decent meal. I'll ask if I can stay the night. When's all is quiet, they're all asleep... I let you in. It's too risky. We don't know what he'll say to Benton. This could be lies he's telling to get us killed! All right, Michael Smyth. Let's see how you do when the wind picks up. [Rocks clink] ♪ ♪ Michael: Whoa whoa. My name's Michael Smyth. Lord Benton's expecting me. - [Door opens] - Go on, sir. I fear he will betray us. [Door shuts] [Knock at door] [Door opens] Begging your pardon, Sir. - Would you like me to... - Out. [Door shuts] Lord Benton. Well, the stowaway returns. I'd assumed you were gone for good. I hope you know I didn't kill your man from the ship. I couldn't care less. Have you made contact with Declan Harp? Yes, Sir. I've kept up my side of the bargain. Have you made contact with Clenna? Harp has accepted you? He threatens to kill me every day. I don't know how much longer I can keep this up. How many men does he have? I've seen twenty, but there's many more, a hundred, possibly two. He's makin' alliances. He is plannin' one right now with the Cree tribe the Lake Walkers. I see. What else? That's all I know. His camp? Michael: I haven't seen a camp. We're constantly on the move. To tell you the truth, my Lord, there's no one place you can find him. I told him I would steal some supplies from the fort here tonight. Perhaps you could help me with that, Sir? I'm to return in the morning. Return where? The river. He, he'll send someone to meet me. He's beyond careful. Yes, of course. Sit. Sir, if I may ask about Clenna... I secure your girl's safety when you deliver Harp. Now, please. You look dreadful and you smell worse. [Liquor pours] [Bottle clanks down] You must be careful. Harp will charm you, persuade you to join his cause. You may even feel the bonds of friendship forming, but this is an illusion. The man cares only about his own gains. He's an animal. He's murdered my men, caused many of his own to die. Do not be seduced by Declan Harp.
