 Previously on "Frontier"... Sir, we've spotted a sail on the horizon. His name is Johnson. Come out of nowhere with a stick up his ass. Give me access to company ledgers... that means now. - Shh. Shh. - Michael, is that you?! I thought of you everyday, Clenna. - Soldiers are coming! - They followed you! Declan Harp, you are under arrest. Make sure his bonds are tight. That's it.

 Take off the hood. Michael Smyth is still at large? Yes, Sir. He can't be far. Find him. Every building, every alley! I want every corner searched until Michael Smyth is found! Sit tight and stay quiet. You'll be safe here. You're bleedin'. Let me see. This is your fault! The Redcoats followed you. Lord Benton set up a trap, and you walked right into it like a fool!

 Harp is like a brother to me. It's impressive. The fear you provoke in others. It demands respect. We're going to have a discussion about respect, or more precisely, your lack of respect for me. He's not in the jail. Nobody's seen him. Are you sure he's still alive? Benton's obsessed with Harp, he's not gonna kill him, not straight off. He'll have him stashed some place out of the way. Well, I want to know where. Get out there, both of you. Talk to whoever you can... company men, soldiers. Just be discrete. Michael Smyth and the woman. Where are they? How should I know? They were under your protection. Says who? And while we're at it, your soldiers made quite a mess last night. I thought we were working together? They were in your back room. Why were you giving them shelter? I wasn't. What is Declan Harp to you, Grace? What the fuck is going on? - You're being paranoid. - Am I? Why would I take such a ridiculous risk? Harp is nothing to me. And I have no idea where the others are. I would like to propose a tally. How many of my men have you killed of late? Seven at the outpost... Another five on the evening you stole the Lake Walker boy. Have I forgotten someone? Yes, last night, two more at the ale house. Fourteen men, my men. Fourteen English soldiers. Fourteen wives bereft and grieving. Fourteen sons made orphans, just like yourself. Fourteen death sentences for Declan Harp. Perhaps I shall hang you fourteen times. You turned your back on me, Declan. You betrayed me. And you will admit this. You will show me respect and you will beg my forgiveness. I made a mistake. I just couldn't bear the thought of Clenna in that house with Benton. You should have known they would follow. I thought I was being careful. You double back, you see if they're behind you! You're right! I wasn't thinkin'. I'm sorry. Harp's not dead, he can't be. We shouldn't be down here! We should find him and help him! Not until it's safe! Do you need help? Here. It's shallow. It's not bad. That doesn't hurt? Of course it hurts. Everything hurts. Are there any more? Um, no. You're good. You went after your woman, you came back alone. Stay here. Captain Johnson for Lord Benton! Hello? Stop it! Let go of me! Be quiet! Captain Chesterfield, what is this?! None of your concern! I am under lord Benton's protection! Captain do not walk away from me, Sir! Chesterfield! Is it true you've captured Declan Harp? He's not in the jail. Where is he?! I wish to see him! Chesterfield! Gather our men together. Now. I don't care how much we owe him, we need to take him down. Have you lost your fuckin' mind?! Samuel Grant's got us by the balls, Douglas. The last thing we should do is antagonize him. So you'd rather we take a bullet in the eye?! - Don't be dramatic. - I was there! I saw it! This is exactly why I didn't want to take his money in the first place! That's not the point! What didn't I say? I said, "it's a terrible fuckin' idea" and I was right! Who the fuck is that now? Douglas Brown. Malcolm Brown. You have defaulted on a substantial debt. By the order of Samuel Grant, you are to be imprisoned and brought to trial. Fuck! What are you doin'?! Let go of me! Please. Do resist again. Mrs. Elizabeth Carruthers. You have my condolences, Madam, for your most poignant loss. Your husband was an exceptional man. My husband was a drunkard. I'm glad he's dead and so are you. You've certainly wasted no time, sending a man to his funeral. Hardly the sort of vulgar move I expect from a man of your standing. He was successful. His enterprise covered everything from trading in raw pelts, to selling beaver hats and everything in-between. He also opened up lucrative trading routes west of the bay. You've done your research. Carruthers and Company is a prize, Madam. Enormous potential. Tell me... Are you planning on running it yourself? You could certainly make a killing. But you'd never let that happen, would you, Mr. Grant? No? Well, you want my husband's company and you will have it at any cost. I intend to fight you tooth and nail. - You will lose. - Will I? Badly. A much better path... would be for us to work together. Better why? Because, well, of course, you are a woman in a man's world, a man's trade. My dear, you must realize, what you more than anything is a man. Such as yourself. Surely you would discard me at the first opportunity, as you have, no doubt, so many women before. I suppose that's a risk you'll have to take. Consider my offer. And please join me tonight for dinner. We can discuss the future. If any of you know the whereabouts of Michael Smyth, - I have a message! - What are you doing? If he wants his girl to live, he will turn himself in! If you do not wish your secrets to be aired aloud, you will let her go. You will mind your business, Grace! I mean it, Chesterfield. What is the matter with you?! You know I will not allow you to threaten the life of an innocent girl! It is not your place to allow me anything! I will go to Lord Benton. I will tell him you've been stealing company furs and forcing me to store them. You're bluffing. Am I? I'll find him without her. That's right, you go you arsehole! You must be Clenna Dolan. She's only just arrived. She's still getting her bearings. I was all disoriented too when I first came ashore. It doesn't mean anything. She's just, she's frightened. Who can blame her? She just needs time to adjust. That's all. What I can't believe is how I almost left her behind. I mean, what was I thinking? You should let her go. Harp was right. She won't survive here. You don't know her. She's strong, she's fierce. She's an Irish girl. So what? She's soft. She'll slow you down. You haven't even met her. I know. I don't think she's the one for you. Your father would be appalled. Do you remember your father? You were how old when he died? Seven? Eight? My God, he was a boring man, and not terribly bright, but a proper company man, with his Indian wife and his young half-breed son. He begged me on his deathbed. "Take care of my boy." Coughing up blood. And I didn't. I taught you. Trade routes, inventory. The storage and transport of pelts. About the wealth it brought. And you were a quick learner. We were a team, conquering the new world together. You were my disciple, my shining star, and I was your mentor, your new father. I gave you everything, and what didn't I get in return? Nothing but disloyalty and disrespect. Something to say? I always hated you. As soon as I could get away from you, I didn't. I knew this would happen. I told you. We should never have taken money from Samuel Grant. Don't even think about blaming me. I'm languishing in this prison because you were stubborn. If it wasn't for the mess you made up north we wouldn't be here! You've been mismanaging things for years! What?! Running the business into the fucking ground! I'm the only thing that's kept you from starving, you ungrateful, foul-mouthed... You're a fuckin' idiot! Elizabeth. You know my brother, Malcolm. It's Carruthers' widow. Elizabeth, aye. My condolences, a terrible loss. To what do we owe this... I've arranged to pay your debt to Samuel Grant and release you from prison. On what condition? I require that you hand over control to me of your business, the Low River Company. And... I require a husband. Either of you will do. It's your choice. Do you accept? Good. I shall obtain your release. Were you there when she died? I'm sorry, you don't have... I shouldn't have asked that. I was hunting. Harp had taken me. We heard the musket fire across the lake, the screaming. We saw the camp burning. We ran and ran and... When we got there the Redcoats had gone. Benton had gone. My sister... on the ground. She was with their son. There was so much blood. I'm the devil, am I? Because I see them as less than human, as savages, feed them cheap brandy and take their land. And so to prove me wrong you went with them, took one as your wife. You forced me to teach you a lesson because you turned away from me. That's why your family was killed, and you have no one to blame but yourself. What?! Sir, it's Captain Johnson. He's becoming impossible. And the boy, have you found him? - No Sir, I... - Find him! We think he's being kept in the magazine. - Let's go get him. - No, it's not safe yet, and he'll be well-guarded. I've brought you food and ale. Well, how much longer do we have to... Clenna? And I've brought you something else. Emberly. Thanks. I'll check back as soon as I can. Are you all right? Clenna, this is Sokanon. Hello. She's Anishinaabe. She's a friend. Does she speak English? He's told me many things about you. Has he? Like what? We should eat. It's fuckin' insanity! Marry her? Give her the company? Fuck that! Good news. Your debt to Mr. Grant has been paid. You're free to go. However, Douglas Brown... You've been charged with the murder of Peter Carruthers. You're jokin'. You're the one who killed him! This is ridiculous! Malcolm! You sort this out! Agh! No, it's too easy for you to blame me. I'm not destroying this world. I am bringing light into the darkness with the gift of civilization, lifting up the land and its people. It requires violence, yes, it's a brutal place, but I am its savior. I am its future. And I demand respect. Say the words, Declan. "Forgive me Father, for I have wronged you." I have one condition of my own. My brother's still in jail. For? The murder of your husband. And you want me to get him out. Ay. Pay a bribe, whatever it takes. I can't just snap my fingers, Mr. Brown. All I'm askin' is that you fuck... is... is that you try. You will not touch me. We will live in the same house, separate rooms. You will not enter my room, not ever. Regarding matters of business, you will do exactly what I tell you. Do you agree? I can't hear you. Aye. Good. Then I believe we have a deal. What about my brother? I'll see what I can do. Good day, Mr. Brown. Don't be stupid. Secure the house. Upstairs, back room, kitchen. What do you think you're doing? I wish to speak to Lord Benton. Sir, you do not have the authority to come in here... You will fetch Lord Benton, wherever he is and bring him here. At once, soldier. Where the fuck is Chesterfield? Is she in the back? It's all right, Mary. Leave us. Perhaps I was a bit rough with the girl, Clenna. Is that an apology? I hold you in high regard, Grace, you know this... your strength and your intelligence and your beauty, but these are difficult times and I need to be able to trust you, and I need you to trust me. Are you in love with Declan Harp? What? Because backing him is beyond foolish. Your loyalty needs to be with me, not him. So he's still alive then? You haven't killed him? He's in the magazine, isn't he? How would you know that? Forget about Harp. You need to be dealing with Captain Johnson. He's a much bigger threat. Now if you're not careful, he'll be governor while you're standing here with your thumb up your arse! What would you have me do? His men are loyal, they outnumber mine. Turns out the man of God is also a degenerate sinner, - a fornicator. - You know this how? There was an incident here involving one of my girls. Arrest him, put him in jail. I'll back you up. So will my girl. Tell me I can trust you when it matters, 'cause that time's coming. You can trust me. Don't ever doubt it again. Mrs. Elizabeth Carruthers and guest. Mr. Brown. You don't mind that I brought a friend, do you, Mr. Grant? On the contrary, I'm delighted. Mr. Brown and I are engaged to be married... after, of course, a suitable mourning period for my poor husband. You said it yourself, Mr. Grant. I need a man. I found one. Set another place at table. It seems congratulations are in order. We've been discussing the future, how to proceed. Haven't we, my darling? Aye. Vis-a-vis the business. Vis-a-vis the trading of furs. As it turns out, we won't need your backing, Mr. Grant. Won't you? Not unless you're willing to accept the leadership of Mr. Brown here. My man. You've had a remarkable day, Mr. Brown. From rags to riches it would seem. Aye. A dream come fuckin' true. What do you think? I think it's clear. Let's go. Where is she going? If we wait any longer it'll be too late. Keep our heads down. Don't draw any attention. Michael, I think we should wait for Emberly! Just stay close. Michael! Wait! Chesterfield has men posted at the magazine. What's that all about? I dunno. Prisoner I suppose. All right. Hoods up. Oi! Stop! You three stop! Take Clenna and go! Go! - What are you doing, Michael?! - Where are you two going?! So arrogant! So self-righteous! You're no different from me. You want power and wealth, and you'll sacrifice everything to get it. Can't you see? We are the same, you and I. The only difference is you have lost and I have won. Say it. "Forgive me, Father, for I have wronged you." We. Are not. The same. Do you know how your family died? They weren't just killed. Your son, though a boy, was strong. He fought on longer than one would expect from any child. No. He was desperately trying to help his mother. She was a strong woman. Very resilient. And when she finally died, she didn't so calling out your name, but of course there was no answer. Or rather, not the answer she was hoping for. You lie. It was only at the end that the true nature of her condition was revealed. She was carrying your unborn daughter. No! No. No! No, you fuckin' lie! No! You fucking lie! Lord Benton! Excellent. Tie him up here. No! No! No! Sir, Captain Johnson occupied the Governor's house with his men. He's demanding to see you. Very well. You... You lie! With me, Chesterfield. He's got sentries at every door, as well as the company storehouse! And you've done nothing? Sir, I'm hardly going to attack and start a civil war. You will put those down or you will be hanged. Let them in. I hereby relieve you of your command pending a full investigation into... On what authority?! Into your affairs here in Fort James... upon the authority of Lord Winston Fisher... Be quiet! The suspicious death of Governor Threadwell. - The apparent theft of company property... - Get out from behind my desk! And your utter mismanagement of company affairs! You will be quiet, you insolent cur, or I shall have you horse... You'll pay for this! You have no fuckin' idea! I know what you've been doing with those servant girls, and I'm arresting you for indecent behavior! You were saying? So what precisely are your intentions, Mr. Brown, vis-a-vis business? My intended hopes to succeed at your game... take on the HBC to conquer it. And he honestly believes he'll succeed? Well, of course he does. He has the full weight of Carruthers and Co behind him. You also recognize that Mr. Grant here is a predator, don't you, my sweet? He will make sure you fail. He will contain you. Neuter you, even. You really want to antagonize him like this, with Douglas still in jail? You needn't worry your head about it, my sweet. Best to keep your mouth shut. From the frying pan to the fire, Mr. Brown. You're really going to marry this woman? To be honest, I'd rather cut my own bullocks off. Well, that's a cautionary tale. Remind me to never get in her debt. I'm not waiting any longer. I'm going to get Harp. The streets are still crawling with Redcoats. You won't do anyone any good by getting yourself killed! We know he's at the magazine. Michael is probably there too. I will free them. Isn't that what you want? That's what we all want. Good. Look after the girl. My name is Clenna, and you need me if you're going to get inside the magazine. Unless you can pick an English lock? Come. Declan. Declan! Maybe you can draw them away? You can make a noise and they'll go see what it is and then I can pick the lock. No. Go and approach them. I'll do the rest. Approach them? Talk to them. About what? Anything. I will protect you. Now go! No wait! Sokanon! I don't know how you lads do it, this cold. It's brutal. Where'd you come from? Must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. I'm completely lost. I'm looking for Lord Benton's... Jesus Christ! My god! You just killed them! Get to work. Got it! Get him down! Hurry! Are you all right?! I'm fine. They didn't touch me. He's lost a lot of blood! His breath is shallow. We've got to get him back to the ale house! Miss Emberly will care for him... he's not safe in Fort James! Shh, shh, shh! Back to town, raise the alarm. Careful. Soldiers are coming. Go, go! - Guard the entrance. - Aye. Ooh! Hunt, Malcolm. Found you a wee match. What the fuck? What now? I've been thinking about your brother, Cedric. Murdered by the HBC. And you. Humiliated by Lord Benton. Framed for a massacre. Wounded. I'm going north to Fort James. Perhaps you'd like to join me. You have unfinished business there, and you will leave Elizabeth Carruthers to me. Think about it. Carefully. What a fuckin' wanker. On your knees, dog! Johnson is dead, my Lord. And Declan Harp? Gone, my Lord. The company won't stand for this. They'll come after you. I guarantee it. Get out. Gather your men. Arrest every one of his soldiers. They're about to have a very difficult winter. And unless you wish to join them, you will recapture Declan Harp. Kill the boy! Come on! My god. They are to show no mercy. Declare yourself. None of us has to die.
