 Previously on Frontier: We need to capture Harp if we want to secure this fort. That's why the HBC has offered to pay 200 pounds for his head. You're a better thief than you are a businessman. You should stick to what you know. When our ship sunk, it took all of our capital, and with it 10,000 pelts. We have to make a move, right now, or the Low River Company is finished. The Brown brothers! One big happy family. If your idiot brother is dead, it's because he deserved it.

 He's weak, take advantage of it. We must serve our King, protect the HBC and take control of this fort. If you issue a full pardon, freeing Harp of all his crimes, I will agree to be your wife. Retrieve me a Brown Brother. I can now pronounce you man and wife. What's going on? You tell your friend to drop his weapon. - Drop it, Gavin! - You know I can't. I ain't walkin' away from 200 quid. I've come too far. Tell him to drop that weapon or you two aren't making it out alive. Jesus Christ, Gavin, drop it! He ain't messing around!

 - I've got him dead to rights, Kavanagh. Don't worry. - No, no, no! How'd you find me? We saw you hunting with the old man and the girl. You stay away from them. I won't bother them, I promise. I want to be left alone. If I let you live, you never saw me. I swear it. Say it. I never saw you. What happened to your arm? I fell on a rock outcrop, cut it open. And Kavanagh? What happened to him? He fell in a river. Hey? He drowned. He's dead. In a river. He's gone. I can see in your eyes. You're a poor liar. No! No... You go north. I go south. You go north, me south. You keep it. Next time we meet. Describe the pain. Sharp or dull? Both. In your gut? Gut. Head. Ball sack. Name a place, it aches. I'm not a doctor, but I've seen this before. It's an excess of choler. You'll purge twice daily. Purge? All I ever do is purge. I'm a river at both ends! The yellow tint confirms it. Excess of choler. Keep this on hand. Copper sulfate, morning and evening. - Mr. Darraugh. - Sir? Assist. That stuff is catching. Just see he takes his medicine. I can name your condition. You're a dead man. - Clean it up. - He's in your charge, you clean up his shit, I'm not yer maid. I'm a Commander in His Majesty's army, and you... I work for Captain Gray, Commander, and I take orders from no man else. So you jump on a dick. You better watch yourself Mr. Darraugh. And I'll hang on to this. The outpost has a stash of furs. It's the perfect target, if we get in and out fast. The outposts are surrounded by soldiers. That need not stop us. Are we going there to steal or to kill? - We won't take them by force. - How then? Inside the tent, there's one, maybe two men. I'll distract them, you take the bundles out the back. What about the Frontiersmen that go there to trade? We time it so there are no Frontiersmen. Fortyfour pelts per bundle, remember? That's enough capital to get us up and running much faster. I'm only in if she's in. Morning, Mrs. Chesterfield. Congratulations on your nuptials, Governor. Thank you, Carter. Too bad there ain't more to go around. - My dear wife! - These notices are still posted. That is not the tone to take with me, Grace. I am this Fort's leader now. How am I supposed to command their respect - if I don't get respect from my own wife? - You want my respect? Honour your word. Lift the bounty. We'll discuss it at dinner. Tonight. I insist. The pulling stations are brand new and the new drying racks more than double our output. And what of quality, Mr. Brown? I think you'll find that our product is the match of anything you'll see in Paris. - Your wife is hard to refuse. - Aye. But perhaps dazzled by technology, she forgets that good felt starts with good fur. The rest is fuss. I think you've misunderstood. The stock is wintercaught and coldpressed. The winter coats make for better garments. And when my wife insists, nobody disappoints. Come, I'll show you the warehouse. Carruthers Furs are coarse rags... and I've got the chafed arsehole to prove it! Malcolm. I returned here to help get my poor wee brother out of prison, but I see him standing before me in the clothes of a wealthy man. So it's Mr. Elizabeth Carruthers now, is it, aye? - Wasn't she betrothed to me? - Get rid of him. Now. Now then, shall we? - Sorry about that. - Please. What are you doing, man? Why'd you marry her? Because you refused her, remember? And you left me here. What was I supposed to do? She gave me the choice to marry her or to rot in jail. What have you been doing? I've been seeking justice for Cedric's murder. Did you kill the man who took his life? You should leave or Elizabeth will have you arrested. Well, if you would kindly remove your bollocks from her purse, we've got Low River business to discuss. The Low River Company is over. Well, as long as the Brown Brothers draw breath, it's not. How is your leg feeling? Why don't you come closer and I'll give you a taste? This is going to be quite difficult. I'm glad to see that you're eating. That should help you heal. Why am I here? Miss Clenna, we are offering you food and lodging while your leg heals properly. And in exchange, we only ask one favour: That you learn to eat like a lady, and talk like a lady, and eventually, walk like a lady. I plan to go back to London as soon as I've saved up enough money for passage. If you indulge us, you'll earn passage to London. And you'll go as a lady. Why do you want me to do this? Because the Marquis De Beaumont is quite smitten with you. And we need your help to entice him into a business deal. Well, I'll not go to bed with that man... Let's just get that straight right now. Of course not. I'll bet against, if you care to make it interesting. I'll bet for, and if I lose, I will, um... I'll make it worth your while. No, no. You've got to be kidding me? Tell me you're not here. Right. You've got three seconds to get the fuck out! If you want to live, you'll hightail your arses out of here. Now! Get a shake on you! On your feet. McTaggart. Don't bother closing your left eye, you can't see shite out of that anyway. That's my boy. You wait right there. Decent shot. And you deserve much worse than that, I'm sure you know. I know. What the fuck are you doing here anyway, you big prick? I need you to help me go after Benton. Aye? And why don't we just castrate the King, while we're at it? You've not heard. Benton's been taken into custody. He's on a ship bound for London. He's gone. You must think me soft, or an idiot. - It's clear you're neither. - Why would I hire him? I should have the man arrested for causing a disturbance. - He's a hard worker. - He's a drunk. Aye. But he functions through it. He knows the trade. Every stage of production, Malcolm's done it, from the bush to the fair. I've only ever heard you curse his name. Alright, he's had a wee bit of back luck. But he's my brother. I assume you're aware that it's undesirable to have the stiff guard hairs in the beaver wool? Pulling guard hairs? That's women's work, ma'am. I wouldn't ask you to do that. The hairs get all over the floor and they mix with the slop. When they dry, it's a devil to scrub. There's a brush and a bucket out by the spigot. I best get started then. I'd like to shove a bucket up her stiff English cran. Remember the greater good, Malcolm. Where are you off to? Christ, you've got a phantom way about you, Mr. Pond. That's not the first time I've heard that. I'm going for a walk. The bonesetter said it'll strengthen the mend. Have you given any thought to our offer? I could get used to this life... but do you really think I could pass for a lady? With time and patience... yes. Well, either way, it starts with not being gimpy, right? So I shall take the air. Don't go too far. Heho! Up she rises. Should we do something? There's not much more we can do, the man's on his last breath. Sir? You're far too busy to be taking care of this pathetic wretch. Would you like me to take over? Have at it, boy. If this isn't a success, the men will abandon the Black Wolf. It'll work. I promise. When it's done, take the pelts back to the river. If we're not there, push off and meet us at camp. - I'll wait for you at the river. - Do as he says. Alright. If I have to kill anyone, I'm going to kill you too. That's totally fair. Come on. I'm here for the reward. What now? For the prisoner. This is the Hudson Bay Company, right? Yes. But... I don't know what you're talking about. You don't know about the reward? Let me go get the soldiers, they'll know all about it. If you make a sound, this man dies. - Don't let her kill me. - Don't make me kill him. She'll really do it. I don't wanna die. Shut up, or I'll cut your throat and bleed you out right here. I'm going to back out, and you're going to stay silent, or he dies. Okay. What's that? I almost threw these in the river I don't know how many times. - I almost had him. - Well there's less chance of taking him down now he's in London. That's his world. Well, if I can't have Benton, I'll take his company. Won't bring him back. We'll see about that. Join me. I need people I can trust. You need cutthroats, plain and simple. To Vengeance, the fickle bitch. Aye, he's a Virginian. Peddles muskets and powder. Leave him be, come on. Harp, what did I just say? What'd you do? Excuse me? What'd you do? I corrected old Mister Russell on his knowledge of the range of a heavy naval cannon, sir. You there. That is mine. Kindly step away from him, if you don't want trouble. I'm happy to make conversation with you, but we should do it once Mister Russell has worked out his issues. You will likely only make matters worse. You've put yourself in harm's way. I will say again, that is my property. You will step aside. McTaggart, take him inside. Well, that tears it. Maybe now I have your attention? Do that again. That man is my property! You goddamned son of a bitch. This is property. This is property. That's a nice coat. Virginia's that way. Two Browns for the price of one. Congratulations, Grant, you've bought yourself Carruthers and Company insiders. Malcolm, are you sure your brother can stomach that? Aye, you needn't worry about him. The question is, do I need to be worried about you? Now, gentlemen. This could be the beginning of a long and productive relationship. As long as we get our company back, we'll do it. Good. Friends forever. Benton was obsessed with Harp. He let the man twist his thinking. And he's not the only one, it seems. Benton saw that Harp inspires loyalty. People want to follow him. People mistake bulk for leadership. And what do you know of either? You know I have it in me. That's why you supported me in this position. I supported you to rid us all of Benton. The added responsibility will change me into a better man. I'm quite certain that's not how it works. Well, let's imagine... that you're made Queen of England. You don't think you could master the role? You're talking manners. I'm talking temperament. You change a man's manners, you do change his temperament. When I was 17... I... I lusted after my cousin, who was promised to another man. And, we weren't allowed to see each other. But... I had urges which could not be quieted. So I went to her. And when my father found out, he marked me with a hot iron. Now, did the pain stop me from wanting my cousin? Of course not. But I stopped visiting her. And with that, the desire faded. So from changed habits comes changed temperaments. Just as you would, with practice, you'd grow fully into the role of Queen. Perhaps we could talk about our agreement. I have an early morning. Ale house affairs, is it? Tell me, why are you so fond of that dump? - Because it's mine. - Your father built it, right? I asked around. He was a rustic man, I'm told. But decent. He raised you on his own. He... fought to give you a life outside of whoring. And then, one day, he just went out and he never came back. We have that in common, hey. Fathers are gone but the wounds remain. Everyone's gone home. Will we be staying long? We? Is that not on my list of duties? To be seeing my wife safely home? I trust your day went well? Besides from your brother's performance, you mean? I meant our time with the Marquis. I hope... The Marquis was pleased, I told you that already. What do you want? A reward? A pat on the head, maybe? Simply making sure that all is well with you. Thank you. Well, here's what you came for. Rescindment of Harp's bounty. They'll be sent to Moose Fort and relayed beyond. You do surprise me, though, Grace. That such a hardheaded woman would lose herself in a child's fantasy. What? The longawaited reunion. It's a lie you tell yourself, but deep down, you know you don't believe it. Take these to Captain Vanstone, have him oversee the delivery of the letters. There's not a woman in Fort James that wouldn't trade places with you right now. Yet, you act like it's a hardship. I value my independence. And I don't want to change that. That's what draws me to you. I've done what you've asked, now it's your turn to satisfy me. Another night. I need to go tend to the ale. - I can't. I can't do it. - Just relax. - I can't, not tonight. - Not tonight? You think I'm a fool. I need time, Jonathan. Just give into it, Grace. Your father is a mirage. So is Harp. This is not... Get out. Boy! Give 'em back to me. That will be all. Fill your boots, son, you're at your Auntie's. And there's some good brandy... Not you, you numpty arsehole, you've cost me enough already. You can stop over tonight, but that's your lot. Declan Harp! Surrender yourself. Well? How many do you think? Six. And the Virginian. I knew it. As soon as I saw you sitting in that corner, I knew trouble would follow, sure as there's shit in a cat. There's no escape, Mr. Harp! We have vantage and we have numbers. Then come on in. Come out peaceably and I'll see you're not harmed. Come out, Mr. Harp, or we'll burn the place down. Aye! That'll be right. Burn them out. Now you wait a minute. My property is in there. This is Company business now. Step aside. Charleston! You come out right this minute! Charleston. Goddamn it, you're a bystander in this! That crazy halfbreed took you prisoner. I vouch for that. Now, you come on out now! You go. No. No. Congratulations. You've got about two minutes to enjoy it before we all die in fucking hellfire. Nah. We'll fight. Well, I've got buckets of powder, but only one musket. Let's just charge at the bastards, hard and loud. This is your last warning! I would prefer to take you alive, Mr. Harp, but we will end this one way or another. This'll get bloody. You in... or are you out? Very well, Mr. Harp. The record will show you chose trial by fire. Burn it. In through the windows, and get the roof going as well. Don't shoot! I surrender... I don't want trouble. There you are, you stubborn beast. And what the hell are you doing wearing my goddamn coat, no less? - You get over here. - Wait, wait. Search this man. That's not necessary. - I don't mean any harm. - Coat off. Now. Just what were your plans with this? Come on. McTaggart! Bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy, bouncy... McTaggart. - Bouncy, bouncy. - McTaggart. What a buzz! We should get going. Could be more coming. So you're in? I'd say I'm downright involved, wouldn't you? I might as well finish what you fucking started. Probably a lot more of this, just worse odds. You coming? What? At least he'll be free. We should follow that prick. Aye. I've exhausted all desire to ever deal with that son of a bitch again. I'd rather move forward. What are you people doing? Why are you not working?! Well... You look like a wrung mop. But your color's come back. Young Chaulk is most attentive. You won't be needin' my tender mercies then. No. But thank you, Mr. Darraugh. Many a man in your position would have left me to my fate. What? Never been thanked by a Lord? Allow me to be the first. And thank you, Chaulk. You have a good heart. Mother says everyone deserves kindness no matter their crime. She is a wise woman, your mother. Was. She's dead. My sincere condolences. My mother... My mother was a barrelchested battleaxe. She was also an appalling cook. I had a habit of foul language. Of course my mother did not approve. One day she said to me, "If I hear the word "bloody" on your lips one more time, there will be no supper "and I will wash your mouth out with soap." What did you say? I said, "I'd rather eat soap than your bloody pudding!" You walk like a boy, talk like a boy, spit and shit like a boy. But you have the unmistakable laugh of a woman. Please, sir. My da's sick, we really needed the coin. And it's... it's the only job I could get that wasn't on my back. A girl alone on a ship like this... My lips are sealed. Go about your business. Trust me, boy. I thought you were actually gonna cut my throat. I was. Not bad for a day's work. I think we should do it again. No. We should use this to build more. Focus on our trade. Why trade when we can steal? You will get yourself killed. Or worse, one of us. I think we'll only get better at it. I think you should be more careful. I had to save your plan back there. Save it? I thought I had the situation perfectly under control. The accent was shite, but it's a shite accent to begin with. If only we could recruit a few more men, get a few boats of our own, we could hit up every outpost along the river! We'd have to do it randomlike and quiet - and under cover of night... - Michael! What? I don't want you to get hurt. I won't. Good. Benton's gone, and the only way to get him back is if we gut the entire Hudson's Bay Company. - Next Wednesday on Discovery... - We're gonna rob Fort James. We found each other, Black Wolf. Argh! - Synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
