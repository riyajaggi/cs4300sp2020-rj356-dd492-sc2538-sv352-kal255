 You go north, I go south. Inside the tent, there's one, maybe two men. I'll distract them and you take the bundles out the back. We should use this to build more, focus on our trade. Why trade when we can steal? - Why would I hire him? - He's a hard worker. - He's a drunk. - But he functions through it. The Marquis De Beaumont is quite smitten with you. And we need your help to entice him into a business deal. Should we do something? Not much more we can do.

 Would you like me to take over? Have at it, boy. Benton's been taken into custody. He's on a ship bound for London. You have the unmistakable laugh of a woman. Join me, I need people I can trust. Congratulations, Grant. You've bought yourself Carruthers and Company insiders. Your alehouse operates by license and with my blessing. I'll be right back. Christ! What the hell!? I got you.

 Harp! - You're alive! - Come here, boy. What the hell are you doing sneaking up on us? Well, took me a long time to find you, Michael! - Sokanon. - Sokanon... Lovely to see you again, sweetheart. - Whoa... - Hey! Sokanon. Touchy! Yeah, I forgot. She hates you. Well, I'm Michael. Go find your pants, Michael. Aye. Bow out, Lordship, before you lose a hand. A gentleman never yields. Aye! Yes! Where's the good money? Mr. Benton, sir, present your flippers! This is for the loss of the good game "ablewhackets". And one more for the same! Funny, lash you put me to didn't feel like a soaked string. It's only a game. If it will salve your wounded pride, Everton, have at. Bit more sporting, don't you think? You'll break his hands! Stop! You wanna fight me, sailor? You touch my friend again, I'll do more than fight you. Never underestimate friends in low places, Everton. Once I tell Lord Fisher of your crimes, your new friends can come to your hanging. Back to work! What happened to you? Well, we've had success hitting HBC outposts and taking furs. So the Black Wolf are thieves now? When Dimanche left, most of the men left. When you disappeared, it was just me and Sokanon. We had a job to convince a few of the men to rejoin us. We needed capital. So we took a few loans from the HBC. I thought you'd approve. Throw straight, not hard. You and Sokanon belong together. She trusts you. Just remember. She's family. So, what now? You tell me, Michael. I think we should keep hitting outposts, we can hit York boats when they portage. We could end up with a thousand pelts. I don't think that's really gonna hurt the Company. Is our goal to rebuild the Black Wolf - or to undermine the Company? - I want both. Sold! To the man with one ear! What the hell is going on here? They're selling all our stock. Bloody ingrates. Explain yourself. You are in arrears, Mrs. Chesterfield. Authentic military heirloom! Can I get bid two guineas? Two? Three? Ten guineas. Sold! That hat belongs to my father. It is not for sale. Actually, Governess, it belongs to your husband. In fact, this whole place became my property when you married me. The ale was licensed by Governor Threadwell to my father. Show me the license. That's what I thought. Another item, these fine tankards! Be reasonable, Grace. Come home. Shall I put you on the block, dearie? I bet you'd fetch a fair price, aye... Don't you dare speak to her like that. What's that? It's... It's just a wee bit of rubbish. There's no need to dirty yourself. It's not proof. We were sabotaged. Without witnesses, we'll be just dismissed as another woman and her Negro servant who can't handle business. Nitric acid. Mix it with quicksilver and it's used in carroting. Mix too much and you spoil the fur. I'll wager that Samuel Grant is behind this. Chin up. Mr. Grant. Pay up. Happily. You've done the impossible, my dear. You've proven me wrong. Extend our invitation to Beaumont. Then I'm lady enough for your toff? That toff happens to be the richest felt buyer in Europe, Miss Dolan. Well, just so we're clear... I'll wrap him 'round my finger, but I'll not... I don't care what you do with your finger, as long as you secure an exclusive agreement with Mr. Beaumont. And if you don't, you'll find your own way back to London. Just so we're clear. One night, ten thousand pelts. We're going to rob Fort James. Ten thousand pelts? Are you out of your mind? We're wanted men. It's not easy to move around Fort James. - But it can be done. - How? Michael's working on a plan. Excuse me. Ten thousand pelts with a handful of men? They're keen. In a fight. But... McTaggart is unpredictable. I know you don't like McTaggart. But he's crazy, and we need crazy. I don't even know the other one. Benton is gone. And the only way to get him back is if we gut the entire Hudson's Bay Company. You don't start a war to kill one man. What you call war, they call business. Stealing their furs won't stop that. If we rob a fort, they reinforce every fort. More men, less profit. It doesn't matter how many lives I take. Only the gold that I cost them. Coin for blood is Benton's way. We can fight them without becoming them, Sokanon. So Michael, what's your plan? How do we get the pelts out of Fort James unnoticed? Season's haul will be in one place: The Company storehouse. There only is one way in or out. That door faces the centre square, which is bordered by the ale house, the blacksmith's shop and the west gate. Which means a lot of people. Yes, but tucked behind the storehouse is this root cellar. So we're gonna dig a tunnel. We take the bundles from the root cellar, through the woods, and to the river. Assuming we could do this out of sight and at a steady pace... it'll take us about a week. And there'll be about a foot and a half of masonry in the foundation to blow through. We're gonna need an explosives expert. Jack. That mad bastard. A friend of yours? He can get through the rock. How do we get out? With a mountain of fur and no ship to transport it? If we had a bunch of canoes at the river, and men who can guide them upriver at night, then it could actually work. Well, we know someone who can deliver canoes. Wahush. Another friend? Then all we need is a buyer in Montreal. I'll take care of that. It's settled. You really think we can do this? I know we can. Good trade. I regret this already. Good man. Alright, take Michael to Wahush. You guys start heading off to Fort James. Boys, let's go pick up Jack and we'll head to Montreal. We'll meet in Fort James in a fortnight. I should go with you. Wahush won't listen to Michael. And I'm bad company with a price on my head. Don't let your guard down. Never. We gotta get to Jack's cabin. He's an explosives expert. Jack was a sapper during the war. Never knew of a fort he couldn't dig through or blow up. And you two are friends, right? Charleston's an odd fucking name, is it not? I actually prefer Charlie. Charlie... Come on, get down! Aw... Fuck! Stay down, we don't know how many there are. There's only one of 'em. Listen. I count eight seconds a shot. Those shots are coming from one place. Nah! Away you go. No man can reload that fast. A musket, no. But a Fergusson rifle... Ol' Mister Russell had one, prized it like none other. Bastard! Eight shots a minute in capable hands. I just need a run at the bastard. Just easy now, hold still. Keep your goddamn head down. Get him to Jack's place. McTaggart knows the way. He's after me, not you. That rifle can hit you from 300 yards out. If he spots you coming... I'll be the last thing he sees. Yah! We found each other, Black Wolf. No man has come so close to killing Tetukin as you. I've come a long way. And now, I've found worthy an opponent. You broke my gun. Its last owner offered it if I would spare his life. I pulled it out of your quiet friend up north. He was a patient one, wasn't he? I track you here. How long you think it take me to track your friends to Jack's? That's where you told them to go, no? Mr. Pond. Mr. and Mrs. Carruthers. Or is it Mrs. Brown? It's Carruthers, I assure you. And who's this on your arm? Not a lady, surely? Miss Dolan. I see you've found a patron. Mr. Pond is a friend. Not to anyone but himself. Miss Dolan. We're expected. Alright, we found Grant's man like you wanted, what's that supposed to prove? The Irish girl worked for me. She knew enough to taint the vats and she's obviously gone over to Grant. Surely you do not think she did it? I'll have her arrested by sundown. Her confession will condemn Grant. And I will beat him. Douglas? What if she's innocent? She's a lowbred Irish girl. I know she's guilty and soon the Magistrate will too. I languished in a prison for something that rat Cobbs Pond did. I'm over the death of my husband. And you should be too. I'll not let that girl pay for something I did. Meaning what exactly? Grace... What are you doing here? May I come in? Strange. Feels bigger in the daylight. I know why you're here. 78th Fraser Highlanders is... your father's regiment. He wore it at the Plains of Abraham. Shed blood to win this land for the King. I only meant to keep it in the family. I would like to meet him someday. No, you wouldn't. Do you mind if I stay awhile? See if the place fits? Of course not. Do you... You want food? There's a... a chicken in the pantry. No, I thought I could just... sit. Read maybe. It will be hard for me to settle in if you sit there staring. Yeah. You're right. So call, if you need anything. Is this him? The guy who makes the boats? And knows the rivers, and can travel more distance than anyone. - No. - Whooooh! Ha, ha! This is Michael. He's a friend. Any friend of yours is a friend of mine. My name is Wahush. We must speak. And eat. Come on! You still know which end is which? How do you know him? Wahush and I were promised to each other. He was your fiancé? You could call it that. Then Benton came... And I left, and joined Harp. Is this going to affect our business? - It's not your concern. - Like hell. He can't know about us if he's going to be a part of the plan. We've come from Declan Harp. And what does Declan Harp want, besides. Redcoat blood? We need to move beaver pelts to Montreal. At night, at the new moon. How many? Ten thousand. You must have pretty big traps. We're going to rob the HBC. I will not help massacre English. You won't. We can do this without killing. Why did you come here? We're traders. Not pirates. You've wasted your time. Maybe you're right. I'm sure we can find better boats elsewhere. You think so? Spend the night, please. Both of you. We should go. Then we leave with nothing. Wahush is right, there is no one else. I don't trust him. I'll change his mind. Try to change yours. Found something to read, I see. Your father's license. It's not exactly literature, is it? Thought you might fancy a cup. You'll have to forgive it, though. I never could make a proper cup of tea. You knew this was here. I'm meticulous about paperwork. Especially yours. The ale's not yours. This proves my father owns it. Then where is he? Why make this so hard? What belongs to me belongs to you, you're my wife. Go on. Go on! You got what you came for. For all the good it will do you. With your father gone so many years, it's time we declare him dead and I claim the alefor firewood. Never seen anybody sew up a boat before. My mother always said... "one loose stitch and you'll be swimming home". She taught you? She and my father, they used to make boats for Harp's people. That's how I met Sokanon. She never mentioned you. My brothers, they used to make fun of us. They used to say she was more of a man than me. She gave them all black eyes. Sounds like she proved their point. You know, maybe she didn't really want a husband. Maybe she just wanted a wife. We must speak. - Are you alright? - Not now. Darraugh. You care about Chaulk, it seems. I looks after him, he looks after me. We're like brothers. Then I should give you warning. Everton has found out about our boy. What did you say? Everton knows Chaulk's secret. You be very careful what you say next, old man. Do not mistake my meaning, the secret is safe with me. I share this with you simply because I fear it will be revealed and great harm will come to Chaulk. I heard Everton say he was going to get her in their storeroom, and take turns. Locked in this cage, I fear I am unable to help. You've helped plenty. Le Marquis De Beaumont. Marquis. I trust your visit has been pleasant? I must say, Monsieur, I will die happy if I never set foot in one more felting factory. I believe you've met Miss Dolan? I had hoped to see you before my business was done. Your Lordship is too kind. It's the latest from Vienna. I heard it there some years ago. I've taken the liberty of drawing up a contract recognizing our exclusive partnership. The finest felt for the finest heads in Europe. Maybe... Vienna sounds beautiful, Marquis. Mademoiselle, it would sound better without all that damned German. You have the nerve to sabotage my business, but when it comes time to place blame on a girl, you lose composure and confess?! For Christ's sake, Elizabeth, this has not been easy for me. I'm so sorry I took you into my home. And for that I'm grateful, but remember, I didn't do anything wrong in the first place. Until now! My brother and I were just trying to get our family back on our feet again. I'm sorry. I am. Samuel Grant's the one who put us up to it. What do you think? I think Mr. Brown deserves credit for not letting an innocent person take the blame for his wrongdoings. However... the cost to us for the damaged furs is considerable. Where does this leave us? I can make this right. See that you do. What in Christ's name possessed you to do that? You know what. I was not going to let some wee innocent take the fall for us. Your sensitive temperament's got us in a right fucking pickle now, hasn't it? I can't believe that after all we've been through, you confessed to that witch! If we're going to get back on our feet, we need to make Grant wear this. Aye. So let's focus on that. Is it absolutely necessary that you sing? Either I sing or I pass out. Jack! Get your ass out here, I'm bleeding like a pig and won't last the night. I need to speak with Grant. Excuse us, Leblanc. What seems to be the problem? Douglas lost his nerve, told that... Elizabeth everything. Well, she can't prove anything. Not if I smash that pot you gave me into dust. Where is it? It's in the larder. Hurry. Mrs. Carruthers! Hello, Mr. Pond. We meet again. I have business with Samuel Grant. Mrs. Carruthers! What an unexpected delight. I'm afraid I have company now... Not for long. Marquis, your host is a cheat and a criminal. I beg your pardon? I hope this is a parlour game, yes? More like a misunderstanding, I think. Mr. Grant destroyed my wife's furs to undermine her business. You will forgive me, Monsieur, but in France such accusations are customarily supported by evidence. Yes! That's the handle from the jar of acid that he used. This is not a parlour game. No, it's not. Proof? Like... like this? What a ridiculous display! This proves nothing. He could have got this anywhere. No, I found some others just like it in the larder there. Should we have a look? Marquis, you must understand... I think I do. Bonsoir, Monsieur. Mademoiselle. - Until we meet again, Marquis. - Indeed, Mrs. Carruthers. Betting on the Brown Brothers was my mistake. And now it'll be yours too. Don't be so hard on them, Mr. Grant. They possess something you lack: Integrity. Shall we? Now there's a look I've seen in the mirror. You are drifting into very deep water. More drink. I have this monster of a man caught in my deadly trap. He begs for mercy. Do I give it? No. JeanMarc Rivard was not born yesterday. I leave him to the wolves. - You're a hard one, Mr. Rivard. - Thank you. People underestimate. You're enjoying the last of my brandy 'cause we're not stopping for more. One night in a warm bed. It's all I ask. We need to put distance between us and Fort James. You mean between you and your husband. You know about that? You're a Governor's wife. It's news. Bloody bastards. - The north gate's clear. - I'm counting on you. Keep this place together? I'll be back before you know it. I know you're out there, Black Wolf. You should have cut your losses! McTaggart! You with us? He's lost a lot of blood! Just let 'em go. - It's just you and me. - Come, Black Wolf. I wait long time for you. We will fight. Your friends... They can go. Except this one. Jack. - He was a noisy piggy. - Harp!? Don't come in here! Aaah! Stop. Stop! You win. You win! It's you and me. Harp. Don't be stupid. We'll never make it out. I told you. I give you my word. Come on, come on. Go, go, go, go! Nyet...! Rest in peace, Jack Crisp, you fucking nutter. Darraugh? Where's Darraugh? I don't know. He seemed rather troubled. What...? Darraugh, no! What did you do? You know that's women's work. Couldn't sleep. Idle hands and all. Look... I know you think Harp is a madman and quite frankly, I'm not sure you're wrong. But I know one thing. We both care about Sokanon, right? Then let's make sure this gets done right. The best boats. And the best men for the job. I'll be waiting at Fort James on the new moon. And I won't be there long. And if you betray me... I don't think I've seen him any whiter. Relax, Michael Smyth. When this is over, we'll speak again. Declan Harp, you owe me. - Governor, calm yourself. - No! Stop! Where is my wife? She's not feeling well today, sir.! The guards saw her leave through the north gate. Where did she go? To Montreal. To find her father. The ale's yours, Mr. Carter. Do what you like with it. What? You can't do that! And who is to fucking stop me? We're going to have a... little more fun around here now. I'll put you girls to work. Synced and corrected by louvette www.addic7ed.com
