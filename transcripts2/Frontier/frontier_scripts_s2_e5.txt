 Previously on Frontier... Soldiers have only one thing on their minds: Protect the gold. And the fur is the gold. One night, 10,000 pelts. We're gonna rob Fort James. Season's haul will be in one place: Company storehouse. Tucked behind the storehouse is this root cellar. There'll be about 1.5 feet of masonry in the foundation to blow through. You really think we can do this? - I know we can. - The infamous Declan Hart. What can I do for you?

 I'm here to establish a business relationship with you. There are not many men that have the courage to shake my hand as an equal. - I'll buy your furs. - I don't suppose your friend Michael has become an expert fur trapper, has he? If he's involved, I'd guess the furs are stolen. Quartermaster Carter, he's purchased Native girls. There's concern being expressed. It's not a situation that needs to get any more volatile. Those girls were taken unwillingly. I can't stand here and watch this happen! We'll fix it. He said he'd rescind the order for your arrest if I married him.

 You married Chesterfield for me? Bidding on the Brown brothers was my mistake. And now it'll be yours, too. Now, Mr. Chaulk, we shall need supplies: Food, blankets... weapons. How was Montreal? It was good. Did you get what you need? Yes. Who's the kid? She was stolen. I'm taking her to Kamenna to live with the Lake Walkers. No. I need you with me. I need to do this. Michael's expecting you with a way through that wall. I know. I'm working on it. Good. You should go. He needs you. You do what she says. They've lowered the boats! They've gone! - Yes, I heard. - Captain Gray sent half the redcoats - to guard the shore party! - Good. - Fewer men to deal with. - Now's our chance! Did you get me a weapon, just in case? Yeah. It's, it's the best I could do. - We should wake up Darraugh. - I'm awake. How are we gonna escape? We won't. What's going on? What did you do? What's the meaning of this? Have you lost your minds?! Something amiss, Captain Gray? You did this! You turned my crew to mutiny. You see, a good leader listens to his men. As it happens, yours were disgruntled. - What did you promise them? - The only things worth having: A fortune and the freedom to spend it. Call them off. Too late. Well done, lads. You've won your freedom and mine. Now, if you want to live to enjoy it... you'll all do... exactly as I say. Cannons at the ready! Load! Fuse! Fire! If I may, Governor... perhaps you might consider halting live drills, to conserve munitions? - We can't afford... - An army thrives on discipline. I'm sending a message to our enemies. Call your men to arms, Vanstone. Yes, sir. Second rank! Make ready! Where's Harp? Less time worrying, Aki. More time... We've made it! Pardon me. May I have a word? What's on your mind, Mr. Brown? Alright? Please. I wish to ask you... to release my brother from his responsibilities to Carruthers and Company. And why would I do that? We might not be the Low River Company anymore, but... You wish to start over. Aye. And you've come looking here for investors? No. Christ, no. The only investors in the Brown family business from now on will be the Browns themselves. As you know, we haven't had the best of luck with outside partners in the past. Elizabeth, I think you need to take a look at the... Malcolm. Is everything alright? Your brother has come here looking for your emancipation from me. - Has he? - Aye, Douglas. - I've sent word back home. - You did what? I told them of what's happened - and that you and I are going to start a new comp... - The answer's no. Douglas has proved himself too valuable to the company. Is it not enough... that you took our company and swallowed it whole, but now you'll prevent me from making a go of something else with my own fucking flesh and blood?! Enough! - Whose side are you on, Douglas? - Everything is so black and white to you. - It's not about taking sides. - It's only about taking sides! Do you really think that starting over, from the ground up, is the best thing for us? Putting the family in even more crippling debt that we cannot cover? What has this... woman done with my brother? Because I don't see him here. All I see is her wee dog. I apologize. I had no idea he was going to do any of that. Douglas... Douglas... May I have a word with you? Aye. If you'd like. In my bedroom. In your... In your what? John. I just spoke to one of my girls. - And? - You roughed her up. I'll not let you treat my girls like that, especially for the pittance you pay. Sometimes passion... takes me over. That's all. What you're doing is foul. It is what it is, Mary. We got to do this right and make some rules. I can't be weak, or else they'll put their fate back in the hands of Quartermaster Carter. Well, I don't think they're doing any better now. No, but you're doing better, aren't you? You're welcome. Is now... What... did you want to speak with me about? Is it true? Is what true? Are you my dog? My brother said that, I didn't. So you're not my dog? He's just mad that I didn't immediately divorce you. So are you... or are you not my dog? I'm not your dog. I'm your husband. My husband who will heel for me? My husband who will beg for me? What is it that you want from me, woman? I want you... to take your clothes off. Is that something you can do? Aye. I can. What the fuck do you call that? Fix yourself up, son. And you. Now, you lot... return to barracks and get your assignments from the Lieutenant. Dismissed! - Can you distract them? - You two, come here. I'll grab the bastard and choke him with his own balls. No bloodshed. I'll fire off a pistol? Make them give chase? We don't need the attention. I just got this fuckin' shirt. That tickles! I don't know if that's brave or stupid. Sometimes they're one and the same. Here. What's the plan? Wait for McTaggart to get rid of them. Then we walk in, we'll take it. Help! I need help! - Go on, you drunken idiot. - No, I'm bleeding! I have to warn you, Captain. Danger... - What sort of danger? - I'm weak. I need a hand. Over there. Look at that! I was picking mushrooms up by the east wall, and out of nowhere, this mad fucker runs at me, pops a hole in me with his knife. I fear for your men. Head to the east wall and keep your eye out for armed rogues. You heard the man, he was attacked. Go on. Careful, boys. - You should get that wound checked. - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait! Be a good laddie, get me some water from that barrel. Get it yourself! My legs'll give out before I make it over there. Cap', sir, please. For fuck's sake. Hurry up, ye pair of bastards. Hey, get some powder! - He's coming! Go, go! - Go, go, go, go! Alright now, drink this and then be off. Where's the cannon? I feel bad. You were being so nice. Now there's a decent shot. Someone's coming. - Michael, my boy. - Harp. You made it. Alright. Well, we got a deal with Elizabeth Carruthers. - She's ready and waiting. - Well done. I guess you got a bit of Irish charm left lurking in there after all. We lost Jack. But we found this. Redcoats are doing military drills. That should hide the sound of the cannon. - Should take care of that wall. - Yeah. Charlie, shall we? Pardon me. Hop! What in the name of Jesus did you bring him in here for? Well, I should've just killed the fucker, but a dead body's a bit more suspicious than a missing one, is it not? Make sure he doesn't make any noise. You're very welcome, by the way. Don't do me any more favours. Alright, boys! Everybody out. - Where's Vanstone? - I don't know, sir. Front rank, make ready! That there rope ain't gonna halt the kickback. She's about as ready... as she gonna be. This may not be your hands around Benton's throat, but in the HBC's eyes... this will end him. If it doesn't end us first. Yeah, this is about as dangerous as it gets. You alright to do this, Charlie? Ain't nobody better than me to do this. McTaggart, go stand watch. This is gonna rip you all fresh new arseholes. Don't fire until I give you the signal. Front rank, ready! Fire! - One... - Cock locks! Fire!! Two... Ready! - Fire! - Now! Whoa! Wait here. And stay out of trouble. I will try my very best. What in Christ's name is going on here? Chesterfield's put the ale in the hands of Quartermaster Carter. I'll kill the bastard. Well, he's in your room right now. - He is, is he? - Yeah, but... You've been missing out, Mrs. Chesterfield. That could've been you. I've a letter from my father. It proves he's indeed alive and well, and that he left his bar in my care while he attends to business. Check the seal against the seal on the contract. Well... I guess dear old Da saved the day after all. It would seem so. Why didn't you tell me you were going? You've exposed yourself as an adulterer. That's grounds for an annulment. I'm the Governor. If I say we're married, we are married. You never should've left Fort without leaving word, Grace. You can return this place to your liking, given your paperwork. But don't ever try sneaking out on me again, luv. Where's Vanstone? - Haven't seen him. - Shite. It's not like him. Something's going on here. - Check the storehouse. - Yes, sir. Shite, shite, shite, shite, shite, shite, shite, shite! Redcoats are looking for fuck knuckles here. We need to move out fast. I'll go distract them. No, wait! I can handle it. How? I owe you a thank you after all, McTaggart. I need your jacket. Marrying you has turned out to be... more adventurous than I thought. Well, it's not how I imagined either. How did you imagine it? That you'd be horrible. Loud. Angry. You'd have every right to be. Aye. But what would the point of that be? I'm beginning to think you might actually be a good man, Douglas Brown. Whatever gave you that notion? There's something over there I want you to sign. What is it? Read it and see. Why are you doing this now, Elizabeth? Because I want to make sure that Samuel Grant can never sabotage my company again. You don't want to fight with a man like that. I should think it's more worrisome to fight with a woman like me. With that I cannot disagree. I'm not asking you to sign anything that isn't true. The truth rarely matters where Samuel Grant and Cobbs Pond are concerned. Well, this time, the truth will prevail. Well, I trust you know what you're doing. Always. Shall we have dinner together tonight? Well, that depends. Will you allow me to sit at the table, or must I sit at your feet? You learn quickly, Mr. Brown. For all of you who want to stay and enjoy the food and the ale, you are welcome. For those of you who have come to enjoy other pleasures, you can drag your arses out and start looking somewhere else. I did my best under the circumstances. I didn't know if you were coming back. I don't care who lies with the Governor, - as long as it's not me. - What is that supposed to mean? I promised I'd take you away from all of this and I failed. I'm sorry about that. I'm going to make things right. But what about these women, ma'am? They were brought here thinking they would have a job, and a halfdecent place to sleep. I'm not sure there's been much sleeping going on around here. Grace... listen to me. Benton brought me here and he abandoned me to this place. And these women will suffer the same fate should we kick them out the door. I'm not going to let that happen. No. But I can't hire them all here. Why don't you find them honest work in the Fort? Or passage to Moose Fort? I'll help you. But first, we need to get this place back to the way it was. And we can start by burning the linens. What's this? Cobbs Pond, you are under arrest for the murder of Bertrand Bernard. - This is ridiculous! - Mr. Grant. - I can handle this. - This is ridiculous! - Where's the proof? - Cobbs, I'll sort this out. You have other work to focus on. Madam, wonderful hair. Alright. What can I do for the Widow Carruthers? Well, hello there. May I come in? Thank you, boys. This is charming. Would you hold my coat, please? You're calculating how much it will cost to pay off the Magistrate. It won't work this time. - There's always a price. - Usually, I'd agree. But this time, I went to all three Magistrates. Individually, they'd take your money. Men like that like to keep their crookedness under their hats. Especially Magistrates. You will not get to make the last move. Won't I? I should think it's time for you to start packing up your stuff and moving along. Although... I would understand if you'd like to wait and see your lover be hanged. You didn't know I was aware? I will have my associate out of jail within the day and I should think that you'll regret ever meddling in our lives. You're an insignificant man. I didn't know till now. I thought you had strength. But you're nothing more than fancy clothes and stuffed notepaper. You've lost... to a woman. I'm more of a man than you'll ever be. - You're showing your weakness, Mr. Grant. - You'll regret having stepped into my fucking house! I've not gotten to where I am in this world by wallowing in regret. Nor do I let insignificant men push me around! You! No! No! No! No! No! No!! I built my company from scratch! No one helped me - not my family, not my parents - I did it myself! Myself! I'm a good man. I'm a good man! I'm a good man. Shite! Bloody hell! Boy, am I glad to see you. Just back from an outpost run. Dropping off me pelts. Some idiot locked me inside. Bad break. You've seen Vanstone? Obviously not. What, is he missing? All clear! Here, come with me to the ale house. If I know Vanstone, he'll be in the ale. There's no sign of him anywhere else. Did you check up the whores' skirts? Maybe we can get a nip of brandy ourselves? Now you're talking! That fucking Irish snake. You boys are so rough. This reminds me of a very funny story. Would you like to hear it? When I was just a little boy, there was another little boy... who I was very fond of. He was a beautiful little monster. But I don't think he liked me very much. That was a good one. He had such pretty eyes. And such a cruel tongue. He hurt my feelings. This is... this is funny... I told him that I didn't think we would ever be very good friends. That I don't think he cared. So I told him that I never wanted to see him again. Ever. Ever, ever... I'm making a mess! I think that you're going to really like this part. One day, he did come back. I was sitting in my kitchen and he walked through the door. Like a little angel with a sneer on his mouth. And I took the spoon and I popped out his eye. I am so bad. I loved him, you know. First love is the worst. 'Cause it doesn't last. I never saw him again. - Do I want to know? - I need a few seconds' head start. I'll do what I can. Michael! When you see him... tell him be safe. Herman! - Sir? - Where's the man that was with you? He's over... He was here a moment ago, sir. Grace. Where is he? - Who? - Michael Smyth. He was just here. The Irish boy? You're seeing things, Governor. I saw him come through the front. Turn the place inside out. You will not find Smyth here. He's probably long dead somewhere, if he's lucky. Go get more men. You four, with me. Where'd that little bastard go? The storehouse! They're after the furs. They're coming! - We've gotta get going. - I know. I'm staying. - What? - As long as they know I'm in here, they won't be looking for you out there. - Harp, no. - Open the door. - Something's jamming the lock, sir. - Then break it. Sir. Stick to the plan, Michael. Alright. Get the furs to Petrie's Rock. Michael. Be careful. Don't get caught this time. Michael Smyth! I'm going to tear you apart. I think you know who I am. Harp?! You remember me? I'm flattered. Break this chain! Yes, sir! Hey, boy! Fuck. They've blown a hole through the wall and taken it first. Get in that tunnel after Harp. I'll bury him! - Where's Sokanon?! - She's not here. Then why am I here?! - Where is she, Michael?! - She had something she needed to do. - Answer me! - She left! Alright? - What are you doing? - I have to go back for him. He's right. We're going back. We'll find you. Jesus! Go, go, go! Does your dad know you're out? Little prick. Mr. Grant? Mr. Grant! Do you... need help? We need to get her body out and tossed in an alley. They'll all think... it was done by a stranger. You should get yourself cleaned up first, and then we'll make a plan. In the meantime, I'll get... at scrubbing this floor. She pushed me too far. It's alright. Gaoler?! Help me. Samuel? I spoke to Clenna. She told me everything. I'm so glad to see you. And I you. How did you get out? I let myself out. And she can never bother us again. I will take care of everything. Harp was set to meet Elizabeth in the north. I'm gonna leave at daybreak. I'll take Clenna with me. Next Wednesday on the season finale of Frontier... - You know I can stop him. - It's not possible. Goodbye Fort James. Where the hell are you taking me? Frontier season finale. Next Wednesday at ten eastern on Discovery. - Synced and corrected by chamallow - - www.addic7ed.com -
