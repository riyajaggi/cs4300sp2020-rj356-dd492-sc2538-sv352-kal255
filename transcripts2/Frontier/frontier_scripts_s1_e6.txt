 Previously on "frontier..." You are under arrest. This is your fault! Lord benton set up a trap. And you walked right into it. You turned your back on me, declan. You betrayed me, And you will beg my forgiveness. I'm looking for lord benton. Cut him down. I don't care what he's doing! Lord benton, sir.

 For reasons I don't pretend to comprehend, You've confined my company to barracks. And cut our rations. It's winter. Rationing is only prudent. Captain chesterfield's men seem to get ample sustenance. Do they? My men are hungry, sir. If we are to make it to spring, We must have more food. Request denied. Captain benedict johnson died two weeks ago, And still no inquiry... Dismissed, commander everton.

 Before he was murdered, You were stripped of your authority. You, sir, are illegally governing fort james! Starve me now if you want. But I will return to england, And I will report all of this. I will ensure the full weight of the law. Comes down on you, sir. Seize commander everton. What the hell is this? Release me at once! Fifty lashes. In the yard. What?! Lord benton is deliberately starving those men. I know. Then do something. To confront him now will get me killed. So you'd be content with a garrison of dead soldiers, Is that it? Why do you give a shit about those men? Because it's an opportunity. Earn their loyalty. With their support as well as your own soldiers, You can arrest benton now. Now's the time. Lock lord benton up. And you are governor. You'd like that? Very much. Good day, captain chesterfield. My god. You look terrible. Where are the others? I came alone. I need food. Ale. Of course. But it's not safe for you here. Christ, if you're seen... Look, declan, I know why you came back here, But I'm telling you, you do not need to do it. Wait! Benton will self-destruct. Captain chesterfield will move into the governor's house. And we will have an advantage. I made an agreement with chesterfield. I know how to handle him. Just please, wait. If benton lives, nothing will change. And if you fail? Look at you, you can hardly breathe. If you die, what then? There's a patrol out every day. They've turned this place over three times. Are you asking me to leave? No... I just... I need to get you somewhere safer than here. Come on. Sokanon, clenna needs to rest. Harp's sick, He's been in and out of consciousness. For over ten days. He's in terrible condition. We have to get to fort james before he does anything. Maybe it's not the best idea to get too close to a man. If he's sick and crazy. Yesterday you were begging to be taken back. Sokanon... she needs to move faster not slower. I've had enough of your shite, you know that? Jesus, clenna, don't... Fuck! Sokanon! Get off her, now! Are you all right? Ungh! Maybe both of you need to rest. There is no way fort james is safe for us. Is declan harp really worth dying for? We need to keep moving. He's cracking up. He's paranoid. Scaring the shit out of his own soldiers. Means he's weak. It means he's unpredictable. Let me see. Jesus. You can't do it. Not now. Not like this. They're gone, grace. My family's dead. Benton tortured them. Shhh... It's all right. Declan? Declan, you're too hurt to go anywhere. Now you promise me you'll change your plan. I've waited so long for you, You cannot leave me now, not like this. I'm sorry. I have to do this. I have to. Kill them on sight. M'lord? Your patrols. Should they discover declan harp. Or any of his consorts, They are to show no mercy. That's unwise, sir. Chesterfield, are you deaf, Or simply confused? Lord benton, with respect. What I'm saying is... Is given recent events, we might want to avoid. Any more unwelcome scrutiny from england. "We do give and grant unto said governor." The powers to make peace or war. With any prince or people whatsoever, "That are not christians." Michael smyth is irish. So is the girl. They won't be missed. Declan harp's head. Is to be stuck on the end of a bayonet. And displayed in the yard. People must understand there are consequences. To treachery and treason. Come on! We have to keep on moving. No, I know. That's right. Two men arrived when you were gone. They asked for you. The one on the right said he received your letter. Samuel grant. And malcolm brown came in very drunk. Asking for captain chesterfield. What is it with men and fucking revenge? All right, you keep an eye on brown, I'll deal with grant. Welcome to fort james, gentlemen. You must be samuel grant. Miss emberly. You guessed. Or did someone spoil our surprise? And...? Cobbs pond. At your service. Is there a place we can speak freely? There is. I hope your tastes will not exceed our cellars, mr. Grant. Please. We are not particular. The stew was exquisite. I was intrigued by your letter. "The key to fort james", I think you described yourself as. So we decided to make the trek. And meet my mysterious correspondent. I had no idea how beautiful she would turn out to be. If I had known you were coming I'd have been more prepared. This is a token of my good faith. I dinnae expect you to reply to my offer in person. Well, I wanted to see for myself... Those wonderful furs you wrote so eloquently about. Not until we have an understanding. Well, an understanding requires. That I see what I might buy. You put me a great risk, sir, By coming here. A woman of your enterprise, I assumed had protection. A redcoat perhaps, Hiding underneath your skirts? In fact, we should present ourselves. At the governor's house, should we not? Yes, sir. Yes. What business do you have with lord benton? None. Never met the man. Simply a courtesy. My proposal was confidential. Can I trust you to be discrete? I understand that discretion for a woman in your position. Is paramount. And that the consequences of discovery. Would be shattering. Mr. Grant? Miss emberly? There's nothing I don't know about what happens here. You need me. Of course. Declan harp, Is he in town? I have not seen him. A shame. I was hoping to kill two birds with one stone. You made your fortune in american pelts. If I'm not mistaken. Fortune? Well, that's an overstatement. Certainly when compared with the success of the hbc. Indeed. Please. Apologies, that was the last of the moose. But cook may be able to scrape up some cold rabbit? We ate at the ale, but thank you. And what did you make of our miss emberly? Who's that? The proprietress. Yes. Fine-looking woman. A whore with more ambition than sense. Not to be trusted. Brandy? Please. And what brings you north, sir? Well, sir, I'm a private businessman. Who believes in identifying and profiting. From common interests. And it seems to... Common interests? Yes. You're a competitor. I'm sure you're aware. That it is customary for a man of your stature. To provide a letter of intention. Before arriving at fort james. I also believe that things may get misinterpreted. Through written correspondence, And if one wants to make new friends. It must be done in person. Friends? Well, if this is a party. Then perhaps I should pour tea. Look to the future, sir. I prefer to learn from history. To the king. Mr. Grant, You and your colleague are accustomed. To more hospitable southern climes. I must caution you that here in the north, Death can be brutal. And come without warning. I do hope you understand. The world you find yourselves in. I have faced far more formidable circumstances, lord benton, And not only have I survived, I found the experience... Fulfilling. But I appreciate your concern for our welfare. It's late. We are raw from travel. Perhaps a meeting tomorrow? I do have a proposition for you. You yankees always do. Tomorrow then. Excuse me? Time was, as wee boys, Me and my brother douglas. Wanted to murder cedric ourselves. The brown brothers. One big happy family. He was my blood but the man was stupid, Thick as turf. We were always cleaning up cedric's mess. Drove us mad. If your idiot brother is dead. It's because he deserved it. You knifed him. No trial. Nuthin'. Get to your point. I loved my brother, So I'm going to cut the inside of your leg. So you bleed like a pig in a butcher shop. Then I'm going to slice open your guts. And shove them down your throat. And when that's done, I'll crack your skull. And piss on your brains. Is that pointed enough for ya? Captain chesterfield? Jonathan. Malcolm brown is drunk and he's grieving. I'm going to gut him like I gutted his brother. You want to be governor? Don't get caught up in that nonsense. Keep your focus - And your focus is benton. There's been a development. What sort of development? I sent a letter to montreal. Offering to sell samuel grant our stolen furs. A letter? Without informing me? The issue is that he's here. At the fort. Jesus christ! He showed up with some thug. They're over at the governor's house right now. This is the consequence. Of you keeping your schemes from me. You need to discover what they're talking about. Fine. I've been thinking about what you said this morning. And? And I've had a revelation about what should happen. Once benton's gone. And what's that? You are to become the new governor's wife. A marriage would be good for business. No more secrets. We can plot our next steps without fear of discovery. And... Perhaps, in-in time, We could start a family to share our good fortune with. Jesus christ. You're serious. You're not going to do no better. I'd rather marry malcolm fucking brown. I could take you right now. In the state lord benton's in, I could do so without fear of reprisal. But, I suspect you would prefer the warmth and security. Of a governor's feather bed. Yeah? We need your help. All right, come on. Shhh... I can't get warm. Shh! Have another brandy. Agh! Don't leave me! I'm right here. You'll die. I'm not gonna die. I'm not gonna die. You just killed one man, michael. That doesn't make you a warrior. You don't belong here. Don't throw me overboard for... For her. Promise. Promise me. We shouldn't wait any longer. Michael, go get grace. We need to straighten her leg. Even then it might be too late. What happens if it's too late? We get the saw. You should drink as much as you can. This is gonna hurt. Fuck off, grace memberly, it already hurts. Shh... It's all right, it's all right. Ready? It's all right, clenna. You're all right. The worst is over. No, it's not. What? Why? It didnae set properly. We're gonna need to do it again. No. Shhh... His frame of mind is not conducive to your proposal. Every man is hungry for something - Food, love, money, power. To know benton's appetite is to have the upper hand. Well, the man seems to have an appetite for blood. 'Cause he sees enemies everywhere. To secure his trust. We'll have to both validate his paranoia. And create the illusion of a mutual enemy. Or we could just kill him. And negotiate with the next man? I remain open to all options. Declare yourself. Declan harp. Mr. Harp? Finally. Forgive mr. Pond, He is zealously dedicated to my protection, Which I appreciate. Why are you in fort james? We're both are committed to the demise of the hbc, Are we not? I've come to judge how long before fort james falls, And, if possible, To give it a little nudge. This cause could be advanced considerably. If you and your people were to trade with me. You deal only with the black wolf company. That's reasonable, Provided you can maintain the volume. To satisfies my needs. Yes. Grace emberly. When the time comes, You provide safe passage to montreal. Or... Wherever she wants to go. Done. Anything else? Tomorrow, go for a walk with benton in the woods, Away from as many soldiers as possible. What do you intend to do? Bury a knife in his chest and cut off his head. I respect a man who is straight and fair. Common interests. Agreed. You shouldn't have followed me. What would you have done if it were me? Where's michael? With clenna. You can't trust grant. You can't trust anyone. Grant has as much interest in benton being dead as we do. Let me go with you and I'll finish this with one arrow. I have to do this myself. You don't! We can't all die... None of us has to die! He has taken them from us. You don't know. He said things and did things, That I can't get out of my head. I have to end him, For her, nuna, For my boy, for us. She wouldn't want this. Declan, I abandoned everything to follow you. We have fought side by side all this time. Please, I don't want this for you. You are all I have left. You have michael. He's ready. He's not! Then you keep testing him until he is. You finish what we started. You destroy the garrison. Re-establish trade with the lake walkers... Machk won't... Machk will listen to you. He has to, Or his people will not survive the winter. Once I kill benton, you swear to me, You'll leave his empire in ashes. Swear to me you'll see to it. Come here. So? What did you want to tell me? Captain chesterfield has a habit. Of walking through the fort, alone, Checking on his patrols and sentries. Where you and I are standing. Is the likeliest place you can surprise him. And avenge your brother's murder. Where's michael? Gone. All right, ladies. Downstairs. Time to open up. How are you feeling, clenna? It's throbbing. More brandy? I feel like I've been in pain. Ever since I got on the boat that brought me here. Well, it hasn't killed you. Must have made you stronger. Don't feel strong. Well, it's not many men who can go through. What you've been through. And still be talking right now. You're strong. You know, we women can take more pain. In this place, That's the greatest advantage a person can have. And because we can take the pain, You and I, Yeah, we're capable of things here that... We would never have thought possible. And you just let him go? After killing ourselves to get back here, After clenna almost lost her fucking leg?! Harp trusts you, michael. Now you have to trust him. And if he dies? Well? I swore I wouldn't follow him. This is rubbish. Being loyal to him doesn't mean letting him commit suicide. I don't expect you to understand. I'm going after him. Redcoats cannae resist other people's silver, hey? Come on! Come on. Come on! This is for my brother, sassanach. Wait, captain chesterfield! In god's name, please! Captain chesterfield, you must stop! Get out of my fucking way! You aren't supposed to be here. I chose to be here. Beautiful grounds. Yes, kensington fucking gardens. Get to your proposition, mr. Grant, it's cold. I would like you to take a message back to the hbc. On my behalf. Why would I do that? Because it will make you richer. A bribe then? It's an incentive. Tell them it makes more sense for them. To trade their furs through montreal. There's a ready port that's open. Far longer than fort james. And you would be our partner there? Exclusively. Yes. Here you have enemies on all sides. Montreal is safe, It is immune from native attack; There are banks, There are warehouses with abundant coal to heat them. And men to work in them. Men the hbc wouldn't have to feed or arm. You have stones, mr. Grant. But if you think I won't cut them off. And feed them to the ravens you're wrong. Remember bunker hill, lord benton. After your so-called "victory", More than a thousand british dead. Left in the mud to rot. Winning a battle when the war is already over - I don't think that's history you want to repeat, is it? I don't know you, mr. Grant. And I'd be a fool to make such a recommendation. Based on a walk in the mud. Lord benton, If I could say something to you, Right here, right now, in this minute, To earn your trust, would you, As a matter of honor, agree to carry out my request? Try me. Declan harp is behind one of these trees, Preparing to kill you. Alone? So I am informed, yes. Kill the boy! No! Go. Malcolm, stay still. Praise the almighty, You shall live through this day, mr. Brown! And chesterfield? Alive. Thank god? I'm not finished with him. God's will and god's miracle. A miraculous escape from the jaws of death. Malcolm, stay still! Give me one good reason. Why I shouldn't have the pair of you hanged. Is that how you would reward us for saving your life? Hang two americans on a trade mission - The hbc won't be the only ones who start asking questions. You think your compatriots. Will start a war in your name? I'd have thought such a ridiculous bluff beneath you. Those who know me know I don't bluff, lord benton. Your company, your king, They won't want the news of a murderous madman in the north. To reach their customers and allies. And if it does, You can be sure you'll meet your own end at the gallows. The charter of the hudson's bay company. Empowers me to raise armies and wage wars. Against all its enemies. I am no enemy of the hbc, I am a businessman, I am a christian. I am well aware of the company charter. I will let you live, But you are to leave fort james immediately. If I do not receive word of your departure, Then you will suffer the same fate as declan harp. And be hanged as conspirators. You may go. I look forward to our next encounter. I saw a gallows being built at the garrison. Harp will hang tonight. Then that's when I'll do it. Do what? I'll blow up the magazine. The powder's already there. A diversion. When you give harp his last rites, Slip this into his hands. Grace, we're gonna need your help as well, Along with imogen and mary. Of course. What do you intend to do about clenna? Your coat, you need your coat. I'm not going anywhere. We don't have time to argue, clenna. No, I-i can't! Okay, I want us to be together, but I can't. What? I want us to have children. A home. A life. I want that, too. I can't do that out there, in the forest! Clenna... They're gonna kill harp, And then they'll kill me. Grace can help us, all right? We'll make it to spring and then we can go home. I won't go back to england. This is where I belong now. Then... Goodbye, michael. Goodbye, clenna. Through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. Your rod and your staff shall comfort me. All the days of my life. And I shall dwell in the house of the lord. In nomine patris, et filii, Et spiritus sancti, Exstinguatur in te omnis... Exstinguatur in te omnis... Virtus diaboli per impositionem. Manuum nostrarum, et... Per... Invo... Invocationem. Martyrum, confessorum, Virginum... Apostolorum... Fire brigade to the magazine! We're under attack! I want men on that ridge. Right away, sir. Secure the fort! Drop him! Drop him now! You five with me! Take lord benton to his house. Sir, go with these men. Sir... In the name of god almighty, stop! Take him! Take him! Go!
