 Previously on "Blood Drive"... - You okay? - [retches] I may have triggered a tracking device. Go find Arthur. Make Heart pay for what they've done. Relax. Put the cop act to rest. Or are you afraid you might just like this little paradise I've created? I felt like you had my back, like you were willing to go dark with me. What the hell's a Soul Reclamator?

 Give me something. Um, uh, okay, here. Super easy. Dogs or cats? Cats. Definitely cats. [engine revs] What do you have against dogs? Nothing. I... Look, I had a dog growing up. I had a black Lab named Daisy. She was great, but she hated Karma. She would growl at her, and then one day, bam! She bit Karma right here. Pinned her down. [sighs] She was only ten. Jesus. I wasn't there, but the neighbors saw it, thank God, and pulled her off, called the cops. They were coming to put her down. Look, I knew it had to happen, but... she was my dog, and I wasn't gonna let anyone lay a hand on her. So I took her out to the quarry. [engine revving] Guess that's the first time I had to kill to protect Karma. Who'd have thought that'd become my whole life, huh? What a lovely story, but I was really hoping the "world's greatest sister" bit would've ended after Karma croaked. [inhales sharply] - Asshole. - Succubus! It's not worth it. After today, we're free and clear. Just one last little thing, and then we're done with this asshole. Forever. Don't miss the turn. [tires squealing] All right, coming through! [engine humming] [people clamoring] If you try to run, the guards have orders to shoot you down. Trust me, you won't want to miss this. Run from what? - [laughs] - Pull it through! Tonight we go live, and I'm gonna put on the greatest show this crumbling shit pile of a planet has ever seen. After tonight, he can't hurt us anymore.
