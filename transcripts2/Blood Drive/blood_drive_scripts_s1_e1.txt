 [mysterious instrumental music] The executives assigned to this show decided to test it in Jersey. As a result, they think you mouthbreathers are too stupid to understand my masterpiece. So listen up, dum-dums, and let me set the stage. The world is broken, no one has any food, oil costs 2,000 a barrel, and the only way out of this shitty life is a secret road race with a $10 million cash prize. But there's a twist: all the cars run on human blood.

You want me to take a look? I am pretty handy. Mm, I bet. Come on. You want to look under my hood, you got to buy me dinner first. Maybe another time.

 Hey. Where are you going? I, um... I'm late. Got to make it to LA by sundown. [engine turning over, engine revving] [tires squealing] - Maybe next time, dude. - Let's go get her. [suspenseful music] ♪ [rock music] ♪ [chuckles] Why'd you stop? I was having so much fun. Out of gas. Well, that's too bad. I'm not. Why don't you hop in, and, uh, I'll give you a ride to town. - Yeah, no, thanks. - Hey, man, let's not do this. I wasted 500 bucks worth of gas chasing you through the desert, so don't be a bitch. No one asked you to race, okay? Barry, she's right. - Please don't. - Dude, come on. - Back off, Todd. - Please, please, don't. Please. - Come on, man. - Back up. Stop. Please. Please don't. Please. Now, you just hold still, and this won't hurt a bit. Funny, I was just about to say that. [grunts] All right, hurry up, Barry. [grunting] Fuck! What the fuck are you doing?

Thirsty, motherfucker? - Reviewing footage. - Shut up. They're gonna dock you for that. Stole half a gallon. That's a level eight. If we don't ration the water, a lot more people die. He's not worth saving, trust me. Come on, man. I don't want to die. Jesus, they're shooting Red now. You can't shoot the stuff. Doesn't work that way. Sir, what are those marks on your arm? Arthur, he's a junkie. Those are track marks. Heroin hasn't been around for years. - Then he's selling plasma. - To who? Hospitals don't have a lot of use for junkie blood. I didn't do nothing, all right? I just wanted water. Tell us what those marks are. Come on, man. They'll kill me if I tell you. Look, I can help you, but you got to talk to me. I don't know who they are, all right? They're not normal. Put it in non-junkie terms for us. No one knows who they are. They bleed the rainbow. [chuckles] He's too fried to makes sense. This is pointless. Try something else. What the fuck are you doing? - Shit! Freeze! - [whirring] It's a warehouse on Perrino Street. That's all I know. [dramatic music] ♪ Approaching destination. Arriving at destination. [horn honking] [thud on roof of car] I want your eyeball. [device beeping] [car horns honking] [telephone ringing] _ This is ContraCrime. How can I help you? You're gonna catch hell when they find out - you let that junkie walk. - Doesn't matter. All I know is, when you work for Sergeant Gower, - you stick to the rules. - I don't care what Gower wants. Police went to shit when they sold out contracts to a private company. Crime's down since we went private. That's 'cause people are afraid. Good. Fear keeps them in line. Man, you're starting to sound like one of those recruitment commercials. Loading credits. We used to be cops, remember? We still are. We're still the good guys. - Loading credits. - Prove it. Come help me investigate that warehouse tonight. [chuckles] No way. Squad's hitting up McGoldrick's tonight. Gonna tie one on. And that new officer's gonna be there. You coming? Oh, I'm good. You want to chase Bigfoot in your own time, fine. But at least punch the clock, punch some faces, get drunk as hell. That's what's expected of you. Gower already doesn't like you. Don't make it worse. Hey, we make quota by Friday and drinks are on me. [cheering] Hey, Saint Arthur... What about you? Those are from both of us. Must have collected these while your camera was off today. Must have. This is the only thing that will impress me. Ten teeth by Friday... or I'll have yours instead. [chuckles] Told you. Forget about the warehouse. Come out with us tonight. Remember that first heat wave... the summer after the fracking quakes? The whole city was rioting. I broke into a public storage unit trying to steal some food. I got caught by a cop. Nice. I have a whole new respect for you. Shut up for two seconds and listen. That was the year they lowered the legal age to 13. I could have been tried as an adult. - So how'd you swing it? - I didn't do a thing. He let me go. He said he didn't want to see another kid hang. Saved my life. That's why you signed up for this shit job? That guy still on the force? No. Every day we go out on patrol, we have a choice... to make this city a better place... or make a violent world more violent. Damn it. You gonna sit on your ass all night, or you gonna help me find this warehouse? Yes. Let's go. [dramatic music] ♪ [engine revving] What is that?

How many more people will they kill while we wait? Make the call. I got to get a better view. Now, if the racers would please line up at the front of the stage... [cheering] As some of you know, we had a few quitters last year. - [audience boos] - I know, I know. But forgive and forget. All right, so we killed the sons of bitches. - [crowd cheering] - No matter, no matter. This year we have an incentive... a state-of-the-art pulse charge implanted at the base of the skull. A bit barbaric? Perhaps. Shamefully pedantic? Without a doubt. But by golly if it won't do the trick. Anyone trying to remove the pulse charge... instant brain jelly. [cheering] If you're racing with a partner... your charges are linked. Get too far apart... bye-bye, cranium. Each day racers will be given a prescribed route. _ But no matter where you are, I'll be watching... _ And so will our private audience on closed-circuit TV. _ Each day ends with another Mayhem Party at the finish line to celebrate the winners. But whoever comes in last... I'm sure you get the idea. - It's fucking cop. - [grunts] [screams] Hey, asshole, you dented my car. Ma'am, stay calm. Stand back. I've got this under control.

We have a decision to make. Is this guy friend or fuel? On the one hand, he works for ContraCrime... the new breed of cop. - crowd: Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! - No, no, no! Then again... these two put on one hell of a show! crowd: Friend! Friend! Friend! Then again... he might try to stop the race. crowd: Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! Fuel! If the crowd grows restless, they get a bit stabby. Best put on a show. [cheering] Asshole. I'll kill you! [groans] Link 'em up! Oh, no, no, no, no, hold on a minute. We're not a team. - You are now. - [grunts] And the fans love her! [cheering] Freeze! Put your hands up now! Every single freak, on the ground with hands on your head. [laughter] - Fuck you, cop. - [groans] - Christopher! - Racers to your marks! Everyone else, see you at the rendezvous. [cheering] Shit! Christopher, run! Chris, get out of here!

Oh, and pull that shit again, and I will shoot you in the head, save us both some misery. - I need to cut this thing out. - Won't work. I heard a rumor that adrenaline messes with them, but, God, if that's true, it would take a hell of a lot, considering who they're injecting. - Then I need a phone. - No way. Lady, I was this close to arresting these sons of bitches, okay? I need to contact my precinct. Oh, my God. You have no clue, do you? You can't just arrest these people. What the hell do you think just happened back there? I saw your friends grind up innocent people for fun. Why would anyone use a car engine just to murder someone, Einstein? [engine revving] Those people were fuel? These cars run on human blood? - Bingo. - [breathing heavily, gags] Dude, if you throw up in my car, I swear to God... Why would anyone do that? Have you seen gas prices lately? Oh, come on. The people that forced you to race, who are they? I wasn't forced. What kind of sick person signs up for this? What... Everyone has something to prove trying to claim that Primo title. Isn't that how you found it? Oh, no. I'm not like you. I'm a cop. I'm trying to help people. Bullshit. No one makes it to the Blood Drive without a little psycho behind the eyes, pal. Miss... look me in the eye and tell me you're really okay murdering people just to win a title. I don't give a shit about being the Primo. But I do care about the $10 million. That's enough to get my sister the help that she needs and set us up for life. And no one's gonna get in the way of that happening. So buckle up, pal, 'cause the last one to this party tonight is a dead man. And so long as you have that bomb implanted in your neck, you're no longer a cop. You're just another racer... and we're stuck with each other. Then we have a problem, 'cause as long as I'm here, no one's going in your engine, and that's a promise. Yeah, well... we'll just cross that bridge when we come to it, shall we? [creepy rock music] You have reached your water limit. - Please step out of the shower. - [sighs] You got to be kidding me. Thanks. Whoa, Sarge, what are you doing? Until we figure out what the hell happened, you're on forced leave. Fuck that, Sarge. Are you shitting me? - I read the report. - You heard what happened. At 0600, we approached... blah, blah, blah, blah, "I hit my head and can't remember the rest." Sign it... before ContraCrime decides to fire you or sue you or break every bone in your face. That's not what happened. The day I let one of my officers write "vampire car" in their report is the same day I let you suck my dick. Now get dressed, go home, get drunk. Internal Affairs will interview you tomorrow. No way. The docs cleared me. I'm going back out there. - Those freaks have my partner. - We will find Saint Arthur. But until ContraCrime clears you, sit on your ass. Bullshit. You know I'm supposed to report you for that. Great. Anyone else want to see my dick? [chuckles] So what? Are you gonna snitch? I'm gonna help you. [breathing heavily] Unauthorized water rations. No. [whimpering] Looks bad. Might need to come off. - Come on, man. - Shut up. Come on, I'm begging you. Beg all you want.

You nearly got me killed. How do they know if you've broken a rule anyway? [clicks tongue] Say cheese. They see and hear everything we do. - So who's watching? - I don't know. Old white men... probably, sitting in leather chairs, ruling the world. Please state your name for the cameras. [scoffs] Dude, we're gonna be in this car for a really long time, so you might as well play along. It's Arthur. _ Holy shit, Art. You look like a Barbie doll. The guy one, not the girl one, but that's still not a compliment. Men are supposed to have scars, not be pretty. What is it? [blades grinding, girl crying] [girl screaming, crying] Go back.

Now... - Fix my car. I'm sorry? Have your little genius fix my car. You can't kill me. It's against the rules. And what do the rules say against maiming? 'Cause I'm pretty sure I could get a bonus for extra carnage if I just chop off your thumbs, unless you really think you can beat me in a fight. Take care of this woman's car. - Smart choice. - What about the Benz? She'll be fine. [both screaming and crying] Oh. Fortune smiles. - Just when the tank needed a topping off. - No, no, no, no, no. It'd be a shame to mar such a lovely mug. Maybe I'll cut it off. Get The Scholar to wear it. Might spice things up a bit. Rules or no rules, he can mess you up. I don't care. It's your face. Suit yourself. They have families waiting for them. Did you ever think about that? Or can you justify anything? You hurt them, next time we meet, I'll do this to you. - [groans] - [chuckles] Oh, very well. [engine sputtering] - Blood under the bridge. - [engine turning over] I promise I will not kill these ladies. We'll free them once you're gone. Okay, she'll run. Very good. Your chariot awaits. How can we be sure he fixed it right? The Scholar is infuriatingly detailed when it comes to his machines. It's his obsession. My obsession is good manners. I am The Gentleman after all. We will keep our word to the letter. But if we meet on the road again, well, that's another matter. Let's go. Ticktock, Barbie. We're way behind. If you kill them, I'll find out about it. If I fail to keep my promise, I will welcome your vengeance. Is everybody a psychopath? How long will their engine hold? About two, three hours, tops.

You're gonna be too much fun. [rock music] ♪ [cheering] [engine revving] You're lucky we're still in the race after that stunt you pulled.

[crowd cheering] Shit. [cheering continues] - Go. Fill her up. - With what? Do I really need to explain it to you? Oh, no, I'm not getting my dick anywhere near that engine. You are if you want to live. [cheering] Our next team is less than a half mile away. Shit. [horn honking] You know, it doesn't really work this way. Then make it work that way, or we're dead. So let's grab our drinks, our food, and the hottest piece of ass you can find, and we'll all gather at the finish line! [cheering] Okay, no pressure. Shit. Those were the last two. Okay. Okay, go, go, go, go. [rock music] ♪ [cheering] - Come on. - The engine's maxed out. We're not gonna make it. - Maybe we can, uh... - Screw it. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna do it at the finish line.

Shit. ♪ Against the odds ♪ [cheering] What are you... what are you doing? - Lay down. - What? Why? We need adrenaline to override the brain bombs, dumb-ass. Fuck.
