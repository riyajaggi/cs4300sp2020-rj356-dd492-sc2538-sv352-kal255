 this piece of shit hybrid! Tone. Yes, dear. Easy, we're no good to Karma if we're dead. Barbie, look, except for Clowndick, we're last. So buckle up. GPS says there's a fork in the road ahead. Looks like we can make some time back if we take the short route. No fucking way, we're not going near that place. You just said we're basically last. What the hell do you know about Steel City? They make cars there. What's to know? They haven't made cars there since The Scar opened. Population went savage after some industrial accident. And by the time the government realized what was happening, it was too late. Government sent troops in. They never made it out. So they sent a second round and the same thing happened. They never sent a third. It's not worth the risk. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm... I'm holding. Hello! - Hello? - Hello. Who else is on the call? Julian. You called me. Jonathan? Julian. Julian Slink. Creator of the Blood Drive, God of... - Yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on. - Hello? Hey, how's it going? It's Nigel from Stacey's office. We're all here. Just gathering the team. - The team? - Jonathan! - Julian. - Let me... gather everybody. Yes. You fuck everybody. - Hello? - Hello! - It's Gary. - Gary! Hello, Jonathan, how are you? Fine. You? Hey, great stuff. Fantastic. - Thank you. - Love it, love it, love it. - So many great details. - Thank you, yes, well, we try our best here, yes, thank you. Great. Look, loving everything. Amazing dailies. We've just got a couple of small, top-line notes. Notes. Yes, of course. Shouldn't we wait for the Old Man, first? Yeah, he told me to start without him. He's gonna join us in a minute, I'm sure. We really fell it's important to raise the stakes. Raise the stakes? I'll take a look at it. What was that? Oh, shit. Bent the rim, God damn it. The strut's cracked. It's parts I don't have. Hey. Don't touch my tools. They make cars in Steel City, right? You think we can find the parts there? Looks like you get your wish after all. The only way we catch up and stay alive is to take the shortcut. Unless the shortcut kills us. You scared? No. STEEL CITY NIGHTFALL www.TUSUBTITULO.com -DIFUNDE LA CULTURA- Okay, we got the parts. See? Coming here wasn't such a big deal. Let's just get the hell out of here. This place gives me the creeps. - Talk to me about your sister. - No! Tell me about what you write in that little diary of yours. I got enough dirt here to start a garden. I just gotta figure out a way to put all the pieces together. Can't figure out Heart's game plan. There is no game plan. They're like a virus. You're wasting your time. It's not a waste of time. This evidence was handed down to me by the best person I ever knew. Guy who died? He... He made me promise I wouldn't give up hope. And I'd pick up where he left off and finish the job he started. I call bullshit. No one's that selfless. - Well, you didn't know him. - No, of course not. But I know the fuck nuts at Heart have my little sister. And if we're preparing for battle, I'd like my frickin' partner to be somewhat of a realist. Everyone has a dark side. you wanna talk about dark sides? All right. Let's talk about your sister. Or we can not. Why'd you leave her in that asylum in the first place? Do not push it, Barbie. No, that's a good place to start. No, it's not. - Oh, you wanna go there? - No, I don't wanna go there. Shit. Dead end. Back it up. Grace? WELCOME TO STEEL CITY LEADING CAR MANUFACTURER OF THE WEST - Oh, I'm coming. - Come. - I want you to come. - No, you come, baby. - I always come first. - You just come, baby. You come, I want you to come for me. Yeah. How about it, Cliffy? We've got the time. I'm good right now. This thing might be slow, but nothing beats the blood mileage. Okay, let's come together. - Ah, okay, in five... five... - Four. - Oh, three. - You used to want to. Whether we needed it or not. What are they doing this far out, anyway? Trying to make it to Salt Lake for the honeymoon? Do you remember ours? How we laughed the whole trip. How we stayed up all night as we took our time... disemboweling the bellhop and listening to his screams. Now we just toss them all in the engine and keep driving. - That's what we signed up for. - Well, we signed up because we hadn't dissected together in years and we needed to do something about it. But this is just... It's not special anymore. What are you saying? Do you ever wonder what it might have been like if we'd married other people? No! Of course not. Have you? Hello? Is someone there? Help me! Help! You can torture me or you can kill me. Either way, I'm not telling you anything. What could you possibly tell me that I don't already know? Jesus! What do you want from me? Obedience. Shit. You wanted dark? Here's your chance. At least we'll leave with a tank full of fuel. Hey, you ever think to reason with somebody before you go stabbing them? You wanna reason with this? Yeah, maybe use words. You ever try that? Fuck this. You know what? We gotta move. Halt! Well, well. Looks like a window of opportunity. What's best practice at this juncture? It is what it is. Let's open the kimono and drill down. Can you say profit sharing? Let's get down to brass tacks. Synergy has touched us once again. This moves the needle. Let's rescue it. And bring it to the supervisor. Yes, sir, Team Leader! - They touch my car, I'll... - Wait, wait, wait. Let them lead us out of here. - They'll show us the way. - Fine. What about the driver? We can't leave them here... Remember your jargon and be above board. We should air this out. These assets are actionable. Doesn't matter. Let's take the 10,000-foot view here. They're not empowered. They'll be dead by sundown. Not bad. Ladies first. Then what are you waiting for? Come and congregate! The fruit hangs low. Go, go, go! SUPERVISOR All hail! Hail! We have been empowered at the bleeding edge. - Yeah, we have! - That's right! Behold, a survivor amid the rubble! Yeah! We gave 110%. We made hay. And our body of work has been presented. Yeah! Are you ready to take this to the next level? Yeah! All thanks to synergy, for it provides us with low-hanging fruit. All hail synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! I still think we should talk to them first. Yeah? You really think they'd understand? These people are crazy. Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! - Halt! - Synergy! Let us worship. All right. Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! Synergy! - Synergy! Synergy! - There's our exit. Okay, I'm gonna get over there and pry open those doors and distract them. As soon as I start to lead them out, you get in the Camaro and follow. Hey, you're not gonna freak out on me if a couple of those psychos end up in my engine on the way out, are you? - Probably. - No, you're right. You know what? It's better if we just jump on them while they're praying and slit their throats. Or neither. Look, Barbie, we're running out of options. Okay? You have to fuckin' choose. Which one? Synergy! Synergy! - Synergy! Synergy! - Car. The Car. You're finally starting to get it. Is that the veil? - He got our kill! - Bastard. You wanna give me a trip down memory lane? You think of the sweetest things. - You're a maniac! - Fuck you! - Shit. - You want it? Remember this one? Christmas '98. You loved that one. Choose something else. Oh, my God! That's disgusting! You're a heathen, you know that? Drive thoughtfully. Reverend Matalas! You'd throw him away? He was our first decapitation. You're right. Cliff. The bellhop! Oh, my God! He liquefied! Have we been married that long? Do the honors? Take the wheel, baby. You show him. Take that! - Good shot! - Yeah! Yeah! You know what? There are just a few things that are missing in some of these relationship scenes, and we'd love it if you'd consider adding, maybe, some ADR, some different music choices. We need more Clowndick. Let's all make sure we stay ahead of the curve. And the Grace/Arthur thing feels kinda okay. But, you know, a little bit stagnant. - Jonathan? - Julian. This comes from the Old Man. He wondered if you could orchestrate a moment early on when Grace can really show her affection for Arthur. But they've already fucked to save their lives. See, that's called drama. Well it's a cross-country blood race with no racing. It's a mood piece. See? Let all compromise within you see inside of you. All choice lies within your own consciousness. It's entirely up to you. Where the hell are you, Arthur? Hello! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey. I'm unarmed. I come in peace. Hold. Team Leader... take the rest. Make sure no one else is lurking in the shadows. Supervisor has spoken. Don't boil the ocean. It's time to reach out. Red and blue, teams of two! Let's go, people, let's go! Move it, move it! Team Leader, proceed with caution. Everyone, glow sticks. Use them. Go, go, go! Hey, team, need a color on this perimeter. - Follow me. - Eyes front. - Blue team, this way. - You got a tight grip on them. - What's your name? - Arthur. Glad you speak English. That's... Oh, the jargon. It may sound like nonsense to you, but it's been a long time since they've seen anyone from the outside world. You may get a little insular, but it's good for team building. - It helps us survive. - Survive? Can't be more than a day's walk to the main road. Emphasis on "day." But speaking of walking... What the hell are you doing here? And how did you have enough gas to get this far into the Dry Zone? That thing must guzzle. You're... not wrong. Okay. Look, look, look. I'm a racer who was forced to detour here, okay? I mean you no harm. I just want the car and I'll be on my way. You can't go anywhere at night. But we need to go now. - We? - That's right, we. You know what? You can stay. I think I'll keep her instead. What the fuck was that? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, they got inside. How did they get inside? When you snuck in here, did you secure the doors behind you? I... You put everyone at risk. My team's scattered all over the place out there, looking for you. You've just killed us all. What the hell are those things? Eyes. Those are eyes. And if these lights go out, you're gonna see some teeth. Let's take the high ground. Secure the area. Oh, my God. We're gonna die. Breed core values. We're over the walls. It is what it is. We have no leverage, but we have to move the needle. There are so many moving parts. - I'm aware. - We're out of fucking pocket. Think outside the box. What's done is done. It's time to make some impact. Yes, sir. - 110%? - 110%. Let's make hay. Liquidated. No! They used to be people. We call them Glimmers. They won't come into the light. What do you mean used to be? What happened to them? 2-4-5 Trioxin. It was a new gasoline additive... when it leaked into the ground water. I've never seen anything like it. I was at a gas station, filling up. This kid runs out of nowhere. and shoves a hose in his mouth. He was drinking the gasoline. His face was ripped open and metal shards and he was bleeding this toxic green sludge. - Jesus. - They were addicted, deranged, and homicidal. City fell overnight. Anyone who drank the water turned into one of those things. And they'll do anything to get to our gasoline. So why are you still here? 'Cause of this stupid cleanse we were on. Drinking bottled water and juices so we weren't poisoned. Now they think I'm some kind of prophet. Why don't you just leave? You can't make it out of the valley before sundown. That's when the Glimmers come out to hunt. What have you guys been eating this whole time? I mean how... how are you even alive? We scavenge during the day when it's safe. We've got food stored. Well, it's enough to last a few years. Yeah, well we're not staying for Thanksgiving dinner, so what's behind that thing? That's the road out of the city. But we need power to open the doors, and we don't have enough gas. We try that now, we drain the generator. Yeah, okay, so we just power the door and get the hell out of here. And then the lights go out and the Glimmers tear us all apart. Even if you get the doors open, you won't make it. They'll swarm the car, rip you to shreds. Do you have a fucking death wish? Don't push your luck. Grace, I believe her. Yeah, so do I. And it doesn't matter, okay? If we're dead either way, I'd rather take my chances on the road. Let me show you something. The light kills them. No shit! We've already killed thousands. They just keep coming. So we need to keep the lights on. Which means we need more gas. Or we're dead. We've got some in our supply room. Where the hell is your supply room? Through there. Okay, we'll get whatever you need for the generator and make it back alive. - What are you doing? - The stink of the car. If they smell the gas of your car... Oh, Sexy Suzy doesn't run on gas. Well, now there's really too much Arthur and Grace. We really feel like we should see more of the other racers. I mean, what's The Gentleman doing in all of this? Give me more of a budget and I'll show you. Also, we're a little confused by the creatures. Glimmers? Is that what they're called? Yes. They said the fucking name. It's a bit of a hat on a hat. You're sounding a little bit agitated. We're just trying to work as a team, here. Unders... I understand we're all here together. We're all making it happen together. And I'm a team player and I want to make sure that I bring out the best in everyone that I am working with. I'm listening, go ahead. Back at the car, you said everybody thinks you're a prophet. Trioxin was supposed to be our salvation. It produced ten times the energy. The cost savings were enormous. That's why I signed off on it. Yeah, well, you didn't know it was gonna poison everyone. The city died because of me. So they can think I'm the Messiah for all I care. Once it gives them hope, it keeps them going. Mercedes, you can't keep carrying that burden. It'll crush you. Staying alive, keeping others alive, it takes a toll. There's just some darkness you can't come back from. There's always a way back. Back at the car, your friend said Sexy Suzy doesn't run on gas. What'd she mean? Oh, that... You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. I've seen some pretty weird things these last few years. Ah, what the hell. The car runs on blood. See? Told you you wouldn't believe me. I believe you. I'm sorry. Please, don't do this. Don't do this. Don't do this! Don't! Come on, guys. They're getting close. Oh, shit. Nitrous. Arthur? Arthur? Barbie! Arthur? Grace! Arthur! She lied. There's only a couple days of food and water left. She's gonna make a break for it. Fuck! Hey! - You're leaving us? - I'm so sorry. No! Oh, what about all those trust exercises? Did they mean nothing? Let me go! You never cared about us. My success would trickle down to each of... no. - There's no I in scream. - No! Help me. Please, help me. Help me. I'm coming. - I'm coming! - Barbie, we gotta go! Barbie, no! Help me. Help me. Barbie, get over here, now. What the fuck are you doing? Fuck it. Oh, shit. Now we can go. Barbie, come on! Let's go! STEEL CITY MOTORS IS PROUD TO PARTNER WITH HEART ENTERPRISES TO UTILIZE THE LATEST IN CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY: TRIOXIN All right, hit it. Grace? Trust me. Please, stop. I can't do this again. You find a puppy crying on the road. - Do you A... - No! Stomp on it to shut it up? Or B, wrap him in a blanket and carry him to the vet's office across the street? If you will not answer, I'll get a real puppy to demonstrate. Jesus Christ. Just stop. I'll answer. B. I pick B. Why are you doing this to me? I'm reconditioning you for life at Heart Enterprises. You must learn to sever yourself from compassion. Only then will you be effective as a cog in our clockwork. Or a cock trapped in mine. Never. I'll never join you. And when my partner busts me out of here, we're gonna beat you to a pile of bolts and wires. Arthur has a new partner now. And he's been a little distracted. So don't expect them to come rescue you. Back to work. You respond to a domestic abuse call and find a starving child bound to a radiator. - Do you A... - I let him die. I let him die! Whatever you say! Whatever you want! Now you're getting it. - Why? - You're clever, Christopher. I have to make sure you're not just telling me what I wanna hear. Barely felt a thing. Don't worry, you'll definitely feel what comes next. Hello there, my silly little psychos. Tonight's stragglers are Clowndick! Then, of course, there's Grace and our little boy in blue. So come one, come all to the finish line! Where are my tweezers? Hey, that was a hell of a bull's-eye back there. You're beautiful. I'm sorry about what I said. I shouldn't have asked that awful question. Of course I don't regret marrying you. It's okay. I found something in the cooler. From our wedding. Something blue. You remember. Do you remember what we did? When the bellhop bled all over the bed? Fuck yes. Fuck. Yes. No fair. There's nothing better than what we have. Nothing worse. This is our life. And I'm happy with it. Me too. Clowndick's coming in hot. Might wanna grab a front row seat. to the carnage. Honk, honk! Clowndick's just too far ahead, we're not gonna make it. Maybe with any luck there'll be some tits at the finish line. How can you possibly be thinking about tits at a time like this? - Where's the finish? - I love you, Clowndick! Come on, baby. Give a kiss to Clowndick. Hey, Dick. Might wanna step on it. Step on this, Slink! I'm the asshole. Fuck! Funny how much they care about each other in all this madness. Nothing. You catch that Heart logo back in Steel City? What of it? Heart's behind Trioxin. If they have the technology to turn people into monsters, how the hell can anyone stop them? Hey, in that hallway, back there in Steel City, you had the opportunity to walk away. And instead you chose to kill that girl. Well, I did what I had to do. Okay? He could have hurt someone else. No, that's not what I'm talking about. I saw your face. What I mean is... I felt like you had my back, like you were willing to go dark with me. I do have your back. We're gonna take Heart down, save your sister, save everybody. I really believe that. Good show. Love the ending. And on that note... Rough day? Evening. I wanna make a trade with you. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, no. Don't do that! Oh, oh, my God. Where'd you get that stuff? Can't say, but I'll share it with you if you do something for me. Well, what... what do you want from me? I need you to get these bombs off our necks. I can't do that. You know, as long as they have a spark in them, they're tamper proof. They'll blow us both up if we try. What about that box that Slink carries around? Can you mess with that? Well, yeah, in theory, but... Okay, I need four hours. Can you do it? All right. Pinky swear? - All right. - Come on, I'm just fucking with you. What are you exactly planning on? - Family reunion. - Look, if they find out... and they will find out... you'll be dead. Maybe. Maybe not. www.TUSUBTITULO.com -DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-
