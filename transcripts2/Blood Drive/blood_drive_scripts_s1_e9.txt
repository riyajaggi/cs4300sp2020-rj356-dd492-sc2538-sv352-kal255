 - Previously on "Blood Drive"... - Tell me about what you write in that little diary of yours. I got enough dirt here to start a garden. I just gotta figure out a way to put all the pieces together. I give you a lot of shit, but you're the real deal. A fucking hero in blue. Remember Officer Aki? I think she's kind of into me. - Welcome to Heart. - [metal clinks] When my partner busts me out of here, we're gonna beat you to a pile of bolts and wires. Arthur has a new partner now.

 So don't expect them to come rescue you. Something's different. You're becoming human. This evidence was handed down to me by the best person I ever knew. He made me promise I'd pick up where he left off. - [grunts] - [gunshot] Ain't no law without blood. You don't see that yet, but you will. You don't know me. I know why you carry that goddamn diary around. I saw what you did to get it, and I... see... you. [gunshot] [exhales sharply]

Table for two? No, ma'am, we need a doctor. We can stitch him up. But you have to order something first. Are you shitting me? [sighs] Jesus Christ. Just take that and call it even. You have to order something. Fine, I'll just do it myself. If I break the rules for you, I have to break the rules for everybody. Fine, fine, then just give us the special, okay?

People call it lots of things. A vision quest, dark night of the soul, tripping balls. [laughs] I prefer to call it dreaming. If that's true, then why are you here? And where's Christopher? I heard you two are pals now. Christopher's fine. In real life, he's [beep] with his [extended beeps]. What was that? What was what? That beeping? This is your dream, Arthur. I'm a creation from your own brain. [ominous tone] If you don't know what's happening to Christopher, then how could I? So none of this is real? I said this was a dream. I didn't say it wasn't real.

You white people - [hair sticks clattering] - come in here... expecting a show, a mystic experience of the East, and "Ching-chong bullshit" rakes in the tips. Well, maybe I'd be more sensitive if my friend weren't bleeding to death. We should have never come here. You could drive for miles in every direction and your friend will be dead before you get anywhere. Okay, well, then stop wasting my time. Help him, please. We'll need more towels from the dining room. Hope blood doesn't make you squeamish. [soft woodwind music playing] ♪ ♪ [ominous tone] What the hell? [ominous tone] What the hell did you do to Arthur? I'm trying to help him. The fuck you are. Look, I don't want to hurt you. [blade clatters] But you fix him right now, or this knife is going in your throat. No, it won't, Grace. - [blade whips] - [gong clashes] That's not who you are anymore. What was that you were saying about stereotypes again?

[gong clashes] [eerie wind chime music] ♪ ♪ You must have been a real panty-dropper with this whole strong, silent type routine. This is the first layer of your subconscious.

It's my job to help you find the key to get out of this dream. Anything else you learn along the way is up to you. But your brain plays tricks on you. So consider yourself warned. Can I go anywhere?

[soft laugh] Now, I don't really have to explain the birds and the bees to you, do I? The birds and the... [baby gurgles] [exhales] He's beautiful. I've given it a lot of thought, and I know you wanted to name him Harrison after your grandfather, but... I think he looks a lot more like a Ribbone, don't you? Rib... wha... what? - Ribbone? - Mm-hmm. Why would you name our son after that psycho? What... why not James or Danny? I mean... [kisses] It reminds me of when we first met. ♪ ♪ Ah, jeez. Now we'll never get you out of here. You need to focus. Is this my future? [scoffs] Yeah. If you're into the whole baby thing. We need to go. Why? [distant horse whinny] Because of him.

[baby fussing] [engine grinding] The house runs on blood? both: Everything runs on blood. Ah, just give her the baby. No, sh... I won't let you kill our son. Arthur Bailey, I'm gonna count to three. I don't care if you count to a fucking billion, bitch. You're gonna give me that baby. I am not gonna give you the baby... get your hands off... [ominous music] ♪ ♪ What the hell? This could have been your future, but you don't think you deserve it, so it's falling apart. [sexual moans] [speaking Spanish] [Latin guitar music] Holy shit... God. You're such a misogynist cliché. Chicks are either the Madonna or the whore to you. [moans] I'm objectifying her? [moaning] Dude, trust me, the key is not in her coin slot. Maybe objectification isn't so bad. - We have to go. - Just... - Now. - Mm... I don't want to go. Ah, you go. [brooding music] ♪ ♪ Oh... oh, God, no. No-no-no, please, please, don't shoot. - Please... - [gunshot] Oh, God. Oh, God, Grace, Grace. Grace! - Grace. - Come with me! You didn't say this was a nightmare! You neglected to tell me how much baggage you have. - [gun cocks] - Now come with me. - [gunshot] - [groans] [tense music] You said this was a dream. Why does this actually hurt? Because this isn't any normal dream. If you die here, you die in real life. [gun cocks] What just happened? Did Grace just die? It's not her dream, so no, relax. - That's good. - No, it's not good! The prick with the gun won't stop until he destroys you from the inside out. [exhales] [ominous tone] [eerie tone] Saw this number on the mailboxes. [shrieking] 1031. Must really mean something to you. When you wake up, you should play those lotto numbers. The universe might be trying to give you a little gift. [brooding music] ♪ ♪ Thanks for taking that bullet for me. You're my hero. Yeah, well... it was no big deal. Especially since I didn't take it for you. Jessica! My pet fish from when I was a kid! [soft laugh] Memories, emotions, phobias... that sort of thing. Inside one of these memories is the key to get you out. [soft, edgy music] ♪ ♪ [dramatic musical sting] ♪ ♪ [crying] Look what I found! ♪ ♪ [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ You're quite the fighter. It's kept you alive all these years. Here, it'll just make you tired. You still think you came here by accident. We had no choice. Your joint's the only thing standing in this godforsaken desert. Which doesn't make any sense because we're by the Scar, and nothing's supposed to work here. I provide a sacred space for travelers to find their path. Your friend and his demons are here to make things right. Just like everyone else who comes here. Yeah? How many of them get happy endings? Most. But not all. Those the herbs you're using on Arthur? [ominous tone] They're not herbs. They're remains... travelers who didn't survive their quest. Looks like you're pretty shitty at your job. Not everyone who comes here survives their quest, just like in life. Why should a dream be any different? Lady, it looks like you've been drinking your own soup, 'cause we're not on any quest. We're your fucking prisoners. There is no greater prison than the one in which we trap ourselves. Besides, who said you were my prisoner? [eerie whoosh] [dramatic musical buildup] Do you ever feel like you've just got too much blood in your body? Ever wish you could make it do something useful for a change? Now you can! Call Vlad's Blood Bank at 555-CASH-NOW. Got a retired relative who's just not pulling her weight? Make a withdrawal from her wrist and turn her blood into cash! Rotten roommate late on rent? Deposit him down at Vlad's, and we'll squeeze the blood from your stoner. Give us a bagful of blood, and we'll give you a bagful of cash! Call Vlad's Blood Bank at 555-CASH-NOW. We give "liquidity" new meaning. You can't go back the way you came. You can only move forward. Welcome to the second layer of your subconscious. This is where things start to get interesting. Great. You want to tell me what I'm supposed to be looking for? [ominous whoosh] Pixie Swallow? Are you serious? Why would the key be there? [sighs] It's your brain, not mine. So the key is somewhere inside there. But first we have to sneak past them without getting killed. They look pretty harmless. Now they do. But if you disturb them in any way, they will wake up and come after you with a vengeance. Of course Grace is Mary Magdalene. And why is Ribbone a rabbi? Not everything has to mean something. Why is Clowndick wearing a cocktail dress? Can we go another way? No. Da Vinci or Dark Horseman? Your choice. [horse whinnies] I'm no doctor, but that does not look like it's working. Eastern medicine, Western medicine... so much depends on him. He's got to find his own way. We try to control our lives, but the world always has the final say. This was my life, before the Scar. One day I was printing menus, the next, the ground had opened up and swallowed up my entire world, including my daughter and her damn cat. ♪ ♪ Why not just leave? I'm bound to this restaurant. Why not just create a dreamworld for yourself where your daughter's still alive? Doesn't work that way. There are limits. The Scar likes things done a certain way. How can the Scar like anything? It's just a crack in the earth. [soft instrumentals] I'm sorry, there's just too many bone fragments. - What? - I can't get them all out. You should prepare to say good-bye. No, you don't know him like I do. He's not just gonna give up. Try again. I'm sorry. Sometimes that's the way the fortune cookie crumbles. He's beyond my abilities. He's too far gone. I'm not gonna lose you too. If you won't do it, I will. [soft instrumentals continue] [gong echoes] [ominous tone] [hushed] Hey. Hey. Is this the key? [rustling] [dark music] ♪ ♪ [intense musical buildup] [crinkling] Arthur, hurry! [snarls] [pounding on door] Hurry... before the chef comes back. Okay. Hold on... Just... sit tight. Why can't I... Why can't I get this free? [suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ Okay. Hold on. Just a second. [grunts] [grunts] [groans] They're all fucking dull! - [knife clatters] - Hey, hey, it's okay. You tried. Take the key and go. - I won't leave you. - You have to. No, no. I'm gonna save you. You're gonna be fine, I promise. Just... Fuck. God! Fucking come on! [electricity sputtering] [cackles] [cackling] [voice deepens] [dark music] [cackling] [chortling] Buddy. I'm so glad to see you, man. Not for long, dude. What? You want to suffer. No, I don't. And I'm here to grant your wish. - What are you talking about? - [metal clanking] - [pained groaning] - Oh, sorry. This bullet is just so damn - stubborn. - [grunts] Ah, using your whole fist? [brooding music] That's a great idea. No-no. No, no, no! [grunts] What's that? I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you with all the yelping. You've always been such a whiny fucker. I thought we were partners. Why are you doing this, man? Because he's not the real Christopher. He's the version in your head. You must feel guilty for leaving him behind. You're not still mad, are ya? I didn't shoot ya, make you wander off into the Scar, half-dead. You're such a piece of shit. Now, now, don't get your blood up. It'll spoil the meat. Look, I get it. You're pissed. But I only did what I had to do to survive. When I was stuck in that Heart Enterprise hellhole and you were out there fucking and killing and fucking some more? That's what you call survival? No-no-no-no-no-I... I only fucked her so my head wouldn't explode! That's what they all say! You would have done the same thing if you were there! Excuse me, I'm sorry, I don't mean to interrupt this beautiful "broment," but there's so much pain and suffering to do and so little time to do it. [dark, edgy music] ♪ ♪ - [whispers] No... - I'm happy we're doing this - together. - No. Christopher, no. Because the only thing better than being inside of you, is knowing I get to eat you afterword. [screaming] [flesh squishing] [clank] [fizzing] It's not the first time you did this, is it? No. I did it once before. On my daughter, Aki. I can only imagine how much she meant to you. I'm sorry. Thank you for helping us. [ominous tone] Is this some kind of a joke? Like I said, your friend isn't the only one on a quest. Enough of the mystical bullshit. How do you have this? How do you even know about Karma? I know everything about you. I know you blame yourself because you couldn't save your sister. I know you refuse to let go of your friend, even though he's clearly dying. And I didn't need the Scar to tell me that. You don't know shit. Oh, yeah? Let's see. [soft somber music] [breathing heavily] ♪ ♪ First, you try pretending you don't care. But that never works. Now it seems you care too much. At some point, you have to accept that it doesn't matter what you care about. Shit happens. There's nothing you can do to stop it. Somewhere in there, Grace, you have to let go. ♪ ♪ [agonized groaning] [pounding, thudding] God damn it. You know, we better serve the first course soon or our guests here are gonna help themselves to some Arthur tartare. [groans] I don't work well under pressure. Can't we just get this over with? No, no, there's no "get this over with" here! We're preparing a Promethean feast with you as the main course. Promethean what? [grunts] We're gonna butcher you up, then we're gonna devour you. And after we eat you, we're gonna digest you and shit you out our backside. But, you, see, you're gonna heal up all good as new so that we get to eat you again tomorrow. And the next day. And the day after that and the day after that, leaving you with an eternity to contemplate your regrets. And to think all of this came out of your boring little Boy Scout brain. Actually, I have to say, I'm... I'm quite jealous. So all this is just a bunch of bullshit? Including the key? No, the key was real. And it means everything. But I actually never wanted you to find it. [suspenseful music] [horse whinnies distantly] That's my cue. [horse whinnies distantly] Shit. Didn't expect him that quick. [grunts] [dramatic music] [metal clinks] ♪ ♪ [glass smashes] ♪ ♪ [crunches] [crunching] [dark, suspenseful music] ♪ ♪ [horse whinnies] [thunder rumbles] As much as I enjoy a good gunfight, what do you say we flip for Arthur's soul?

[click] [funky theme music over TV] ♪ ♪ [exciting music] ♪ ♪ Remember the first heat wave? Summer after the fracking quake? This whole city was rioting.

LAPD ain't even in control anymore! Yeah? Well, you sure ain't. And you are in the wrong place. Throw the gun out along the floor. All right, come out of there. Nice and easy. No sudden moves. Come on, kid, what the hell are you doing? Wait a minute. You one of those demos? Demo what? What color do you bleed? [dramatic musical flourish] [grunts] You make one more move, and I will blow the wires right out of your head. [soft suspenseful music] Who sent you? Are you fucking crazy, man? I just came in for supplies. Check my bag, I swear. [soft laugh] My God. I really thought you were a... But you are just some dumbass burglar. [over radio] Sutherland, what's the status on that 1070? Should we send backup? No, hey, I'm sorry I took all that stuff, man. I'm sorry I took all that stuff. I... I... just... I was just trying to eat. [radio clicks] Roger, I'm 10-106 here. False alarm.

Thank you. Wait. ♪ ♪ You forgot something. ♪ ♪ Come on. Take it. I know you're just trying to survive, kid. But if you think that world is bad out there now, it's about to get a whole lot worse.

You gotta call the paramedics on your radio. [scoffs] Kid. ContraCrime might have just bought the LAPD... they took over the hospitals years ago. Do I look like I can afford an ambulance? God damn it, this is so fucked up. I can't... I can't... I can't stop the bleeding. It's too much. - Relax, kid. - Oh, fuck. You're not the one who's dying. But it was my fault. Can't argue with that. Kid, you want to make this right? [inhales sharply] [pained groan] Here. Take this. Are you... you want me... you want me to give this to somebody? Nah, there's nobody to give it to. Nobody'd ever believed me. There's somebody behind all of this crazy shit that I was talking about before. But I just don't know who. But everything I do know is in that book. I don't expect you to believe it. Didn't believe it myself when I first found out. But if you do believe it, don't ignore it. Okay. I'll do... I'll do whatever you want. That book is the only shred of evidence I have I did anything worthwhile with my life. [soft dramatic music] [over radio] Sutherland, you copy?
