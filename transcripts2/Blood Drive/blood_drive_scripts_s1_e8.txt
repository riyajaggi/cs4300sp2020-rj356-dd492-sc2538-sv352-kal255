 - you don't find it odd that we're the only racers on this road right now? - Heart might be an evil corporation, but their tech is top notch. - I feel like slink is up to something. - Like drugging up someone else's sister and making them go crazy? I'm gonna kill you, master of mayhem. - Grace. - Sixth stage of grief. Revenge. - Okay, there's no way for me to know what you're going through right now,

 but I need you to stay with me on this one, okay? - That's the first cop car I've seen in ages. - Make sure your seatbelts are on. I got this. - Perfect timing. We need fuel. - ugh. - Relax, Barbie. It's just a cop. You speak the language. Afternoon. You folks in a hurry? - Yeah, sorry, officer. We're just, uh, trying to make up some time in the back roads. - Everything all right? - Uh, yes, sir.

 Right as rain. Just, uh, been a long haul. - And you, ma'am? You okay? - Oh, yeah, I'm absolutely fine, sir. Thanks. - Uh, you know, I have a lot of respect for the badge. Los Angeles. - Damn shame what they did to that force. Turning them into a bunch of clock-punching civilians. You're a long way from Los Angeles. Where you headed? - Uh, red river. - What's your business there? - We under arrest? - Not yet. But I clocked you at 92 per. - Right, um, and like I said, I'm so sorry, um... - I could use some help. Police help. - Oh, we'd love to. But like you said, we're really in a rush. - Young lady, there's only one road and it runs right through red river and I'm the sheriff of red river. Things starting to add up yet? - Yes, either we help you out or we don't pass. - Straight up the road. Three more miles. There's a garage off to your right. Park there. - let's blow through. I'll do a little backup work. How long can it really take? - too much of a pussy to kill me yourself, slink? Master of mayhem, my ass. More like masturbator of yourself. - Who else is he supposed to masturbate? - I am getting so sick of this race. - I wonder why they don't let cars in. - Maybe it's cause they've heard that some cars eat people. Ow. Did you feel that? - Emp. - That's electromagnetic pulse. It disables anything with an electric charge. - That's right. Sheriff Leon has me run an emp device at all times. Creates a barrier around the town. There's no power allowed in red river. Cars end up just stalling out. Not sure why it did that to your necks, though. - What is it, MacGyver? - Brain bombs. - Never seen tech like this. - Hey, be careful with those. If they power back up, they can explode. - These things are right against your spine. Who did this to you? - Someone you don't wanna know. - No way. You've gotta be kidding me. My god, do you know what this is? This is a new fusion. This is a beta of a nuclear-powered sedan. They only made 12. Oh, wowzers. - Wowzers? - What's so special about it? - Gets a million miles to the charge. - A million? To one charge? - It only takes one charge. It's nuclear-powered. Do you know, Terry, I've been looking for one of these for a long time. - So why didn't you sell it? It's gotta be worth a fortune. - This vehicle is a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing, you don't sell it. You admire it. - hey, there. - You girls done kissing each other? Town's this way. - Hey, if it's okay with you guys, I think I'm gonna stay here and see if I can make myself useful. - I like you, lady. Being useful is the best thing you can be. Let's go. It started with the scar. That god damn rip created all kinds of horrible shit. People got sick, went crazy. Took me a while. I finally figured it out. We were getting our electricity from the worktel power grid, part of which hung over the scar. Whatever evil was seeping out of that wound, was getting to us through the power lines. - What do you mean, evil? - I cut the lines. Thought that would solve it. But the sickness was already here. - So what do you need from us? - Well, the sickness got into some of the townsfolk, twisted them up inside. Started using electricity as a weapon. Cattle prods, tasers. Only way to stop them was to fire up a juice killer. Ain't got no juice, they ain't a threat no more. - So you have a pretty solid way of keeping them out. What's the problem? - They're more of them now. And I'm hearing they're fixing to come back and finish what they started. But they don't know your face. Now, you could sneak into their camp, shut down their power source, then I could stop them for good. Undercover work. You up for it? - Do I really have a choice? - You're welcome to get cleaned up at the hotel. I'll meet you at the police station in an hour. - enjoy. - Thank you. I can get used to this. Maybe stay here a while. - Sure beats the inside of a Camaro. - get off! Aah! - Karma's dead. All I know is she fought like a warrior. - Grace! Barbie? - Yes? - Why don't you come in here a minute? - I can hear you fine from out here. - Come on, we've already crossed that threshold. Wanna cross it again? - You can't fuck the pain away. - No harm in trying. Plus, I feel free. And I like it. And I'm horny. Grace. - Yeah? - I like you. - You do? - I do. - Mm-hmm. - But-- - but what? - if sex is your drug of choice, I don't wanna be your fix. - Why do you always have to overthink everything, Arthur Bailey? Sometimes it's fun to just... Act. Suit yourself. - what he hell? Wait! What happened here? - been living in red river for...Ten years. My partner and I moved here to get away from it all, but then the scar happened, and-- - things got weird? - Yeah. Can you give me a 9/16? - Yeah, sure. Here. So what happened to your friend, anyway? - Split or died. Not sure which. Doesn't matter, I guess. I'm alone. Being alone's not too bad, i guess. Gives me time to tinker with my babies. Not too proud to say it. Not a lot of people like me. Think I'm weird for some reason. So who cares? I'm gonna be alone, i might as well be alone here. - Yeah... I'm alone, too. - whiskey. Any brand. - We don't serve any alcohol here. The sheriff won't allow it. - So what the hell do you serve? - Espresso. You read the sign, right? - Just Espresso? - Just Espresso. Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry. Fire cracked and sun soaked for exactly 37 hours. - Wait, what? Oh, sorry. You lost me when you said no fuckin' whiskey. Care to repeat it? - Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry-- - rhetorical. - I hear you wanna kill me. - You're gonna sit down and watch me drink this whiskey until the bottle's empty. Then you die. - That's my girl. - You're late. Here's the rebel power station. - Defenses? - Electrified fencing all around it. We won't get close enough to strike while they still have juice. Put those on--they'll kill you if they see they uniform. We send you to the front gate with a power pack. You need a charge. Use your city boy charm. Get 'em to let you in. - What do I do once I get inside? - Hook up your pack. That'll shut down their power. Defenses go dark, we go in. - You're gonna arrest them, right? - That's up to them. - Right on cue. - I need your help. - Of course you do. - I'm a little busy here, Arthur. - I'm not sure the sheriff is playing us card up. - Yeah? He's probably not. No one is. - It's feeling like a two man job. - I can't help you, Barbie. You see, slink and I have some unfinished business. - Saddle up, boys! Let's ride out! - He really is a handsome devil, isn't he? Mm. - police bought the shit  when they sold our contracts to a private company. We used to be cops, remember? - We still are. We're still the good guys. - People are afraid. - Good, fear keeps them in line. - I need help.  Please help me. - Calm down, ma'am. Tell me where you are. - Aah, they're coming! They're gonna eat me. - don't know you, stranger. - I'm not from here and I'm not staying. I'm from the west, trying to get past the scar. - How'd you get through red river? - I didn't. Left my car at a garage. I need to charge my power pack. Person there said this is the only place with juice for 100 miles. - We don't trade with people we don't know. - I've got water. Distilled from the pacific northwest. - How much power do you need? Then you move on? - Then I move on. So why don't you trade with red river? They don't have any electricity at all. - Are you trading or asking questions? - Just curious. - We don't care for red river folks. Least of all, sheriff Leon. Where'd you say you're from again? - I didn't. I'm from the California territory. - What do you do for work? - I was a mailman. - Yeah. That seems right. This way. Come on. - So what happened between you and sheriff Leon? - Soon as you're full, you're gone. You killed us! - pick him up. Get him back to town. - All right, you've got the upper hand. Now why don't we just pull some wire back to red river and turn the power back on? - After the trial. - Tell your men to take it easy. These are families. - He's right. Don't rough 'em up too much. We want them to be awake when their necks snap. Time to build the gallows, boys. - Seems like you already know how the trial's gonna end, sheriff. - Punishment has to fit the crime. - They haven't been convicted of a crime yet. You made it sound like these people were monsters, but they barely even fought back. Talk to me. - You're not a cop. You're barely half a man and I'm done with you. Now you shut your hole and shove off, pretty boy. Unless you want a turn at the end of a rope. Torrent downloaded from RARBG - ah. - Look what I found. A cunt cop. - Fellas, I don't want any trouble. - Trouble is what you found. - As an employee of contracrime, I'll be forced to place you under arrest. - Contracrime is dead, dumbass. There ain't no laws no more. - What the hell are you talking about? Where is everybody? - They split, like your head's gonna be. - That's not true. - I'm not gonna lie, tearing this city apart was fun as hell. But now, it runs in those fracking tubes. And there's no one left to play with. Until now. This is gonna hurt a lot! - You okay, bro? - Yo, you okay? - Aah! - I see you've engaged your retinal security protocol. - What's happening to me? - You're becoming. - Becoming what? I don't wanna hurt you. - Christopher, I wasn't programmed with any emotions. Only to mimic them when it was needed. But when you told me you... Loved me... Something happened. When you left this morning, i missed your presence, your warmth. I missed you. I didn't even understand what that phrase meant until now. I don't know how to explain what I feel. But I think the human word for it is... Love. - Ah. Is this one of your tricks? - no. I'm here for you. I'll take care of you. - hey, grace, you need any help? - Nope. - Well, I do...Bad. - Officer Bailey, will you very kindly fuck off! - Look, this town isn't so great. The sheriff is a sociopath and I just helped him grab up a bunch of innocent people whose only crime was trying to be free. - No can do, Barbie. You're on your own. - He's gonna kill a kid, grace. Please. What if this was Karma? - Karma's dead. Okay? So you go fight your own demons. I'll fight mine. I... - Can't let you do this, sheriff. - I ain't asking you. - You know this isn't right. - I ain't taking life advice from a tin star. Out here, justice is in the hand of the man holding the gun. And it's swift. - You would shoot an unarmed cop? - You ain't a cop. You're just some asshole in a costume. Tell the hangman, grab another rope. We got one more coming. Come on, come on. - Unwashed Ethiopian peaberry. Fire cracked and sun soaked for exactly 37 hours. - Wait, what? Oh, sorry. You lost me when you said no fuckin' whiskey. - I hear you wanna kill me. - You're gonna sit down and watch me drink this whiskey until the bottle's empty. Then you die. - That's my girl. My dear, if I was going to poison you, I wouldn't waste it with good whiskey. Ah! I have to say, when I recruited you, I had no idea you'd be this good. So disappointed to see that my hand-picked battle bitch has gone all domestic. - You didn't recruit me. You manipulated and lied to me. - Potatoes, potahtos. - You really think this is gonna end well for you, huh? - It always has. Did I ever tell you how i started the blood drive? It's a funny story. Well, not funny-funny, but funny. You don't know who I really am, do you? - You mean, besides a sexless monster, created from dirty jizz and a broken egg? - I'm built for this life. Literally, you can't best me, grace. I'm always a step ahead. - Yeah, I've heard this speech before. - You should've listened. You can try and kill me if you like. Fine by me. But look around you, little missy. This here's a showdown. Who's gonna draw first? Cheers. - Aah! - You know, for this to be a fair fight, I really should... Put one hand behind my back. or stapled to the table, as it were. Right on cue. - I need your help. - Of course you do. - I'm a little busy here, Arthur. - I'm not sure the sheriff is playing us card up. - Yeah, he's probably not. No one is. - Hear, hear. - It's feeling like a two man job. - I can't help you, Barbie. You see, slink and I have some unfinished business. - Saddle up, boys! Let's ride out! - He really is a handsome devil, isn't he? Mm. Are you really gonna let chiseled chin lead you off to a new mission? - I would rather kill you 100 times than do anything else. - a parlor trick. This here... This here's the real magic. Let's play a little game. 20 questions for 20 punches. Question one: Where'd you and Karma grow up? - Kansas. it's on the license plate, you dipshit. - Speaking of which, where did you get the Camaro? - My dad. What else you got? - How did your parents die? you didn't answer that one. - Didn't have to. - Okay, then. Looks like we might be here for a little while. Wow, your life reads like one long, depressing country song. - Now you're gonna answer one of my questions. - Oh. - Why are you so obsessed with me and my sister? - Heart enterprises, they--they round off the edges. And then they complain it's not edgy enough. And all their terrible notes, you keep popping up. "Make her get naked more." "We need more boobies, boobies, boobies!" "Why does she always have to wear those stupid tool belts?" "Does she have to race with that cop?" - In other words, you don't know. - They're ruining my show. - Maybe I should've just asked one of the executives. That's where all the real power is. Because I don't think you have control at all. You're just a freak who wears too much makeup and thinks he's an artist. Hm. Aah! what the hell are you? - I'm fuckin' fabulous. - Hey, grace, you need any help? - No. - Well I do...Bad. - Officer Bailey, will you very kindly fuck off! - Look, this town isn't so great. The sheriff is a sociopath and I just helped him grab up a bunch of innocent people whose only crime was trying to be free. - No can do, Barbie. You're on your own. - He's gonna kill a kid, grace. Please. What if this was Karma? - Karma's dead. Okay? So you go fight your own demons. I'll fight mine. I... - Is that what i am to you, now? A demon? - Looks like someone at heart has a hard on for me. I know nothing about it. But you probably shouldn't mess with their favorite racer. You, on the other hand, they probably want dead. So how about we give the fans what they want? - have you wondered why i sent you here to red river? A place where there's no electricity? - 'Cause you're an idiot. No electricity means no brain bombs. - ah, but neither are there any cameras. No one to watch. - You brought us here 'cause you wanna kill me. so heart wants me alive and you want me dead? - Call it an executive decision. Ratings. Live plus seven, live plus three. What does that even mean? you are a stain on my masterpiece. - My god, you're a piece of shit. - Grace! Now would be the time! - Don't be clich?. My hat! This is vintage! I told you. You can't hurt me. You certainly can't kill me. - I wasn't trying to kill you. Needed this. - It won't work. - I have to try. - You think you're the first innocent man in this jail? You deserve it, though, after what you did to me and mine. - He tricked me. He said you were evil. - And you believed him. - Oh, you got the evil part right. You just blamed the wrong person. He sell you the story about the scar changing people? - Yeah. - Well, it's true. Only he was the one that changed. - Stopped trusting anyone. Killed anyone who disagreed with him. Even his own deputies. - That's why people are so focused on their jobs here. Because if you don't do it to perfection, you're gonna pay with your life. - No one pushed back? - We did. - What happened? - Our family got a lot smaller. - Oh, Christ. I'm so sorry. - we make a great team. - We're like two pieces of the same puzzle. That sounded corny. Stupid Terry! Stupid. - Stop it. Don't say that. You're not stupid, all right? I-i actually think you're beautiful. - I am? - there's nothing else left to repair. - Except...Us. - wow. That was one hell of a day. - something's different. - Your eyes. They're... Human. you've never done that before. - What? - Covered yourself. What are you feeling? Shame. That's good. - Why is that good? - You're becoming human. - You're right. I feel. I actually feel. Our connection caused a kernel boot error. A severe stack overflow. - What does that even mean? - it means I love you, Christopher. - I love you too, aki. - What do we do now? - we get the hell out of this city. - you don't have to do this. - Yes, I do. Order must be maintained. - People don't have to die to maintain order. That's why we have laws. - That's what got us into this mess. There were laws about fracking, weren't there? Laws don't mean shit when you don't enforce them with blood. Grab the boy first. Both: No! - Who do you think you are? You're gonna die first. I can't stand the sight of you. no. I want the last thing he sees to be my face. She can't save you now. nothing can save you now. - Grace! Now would be the time! - I want the last thing he sees to be my face. She can't save you now. nothing can save you now. - Grace! Now would be the time! - Okay, hangman. Do your job. - I'm sorry. I was just trying to do the right thing. Ah! - ah! - Uh. Aah! You son of a bitch. You killed children. - There ain't no law without blood. You don't see that yet, but you will. - Shut your mouth. You don't know me. - I know why you carry that god damn diary around, Arthur Bailey. I saw what you did to get it. - How do you know that? - And it ain't nothing compared to what you're gonna do. That's what the scar did to me, kid. It helped me see. And I see... You. - Arthur. - Oh, shit. You're hurt Arthur. Arthur. okay, Terry says there's a doctor in the next town. You're gonna be okay. I gotta go. You sure you're gonna be happy here? - You saved my life. - When were you in danger? - I'm not talking about that. Besides... This town needs a new sheriff. - Good luck, you two. Huh. You can take one hell of a licking, but you still bleed. Have the guts to put on that same show when the cameras are running? Yeah. I thought so. - You don't really think you're gonna live happily ever after, do you? He shot that sheriff in cold blood. Even you saw it. Or did that just make you wet? - Your petty bullshit isn't gonna work on me anymore. Follow us, and we'll find a way to kill you. - left you live, right you die. Left you live, right you die. Left you live, right--
