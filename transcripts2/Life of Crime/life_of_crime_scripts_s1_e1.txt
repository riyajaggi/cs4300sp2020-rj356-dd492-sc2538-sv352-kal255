 and will continue to take for freedom.' You think he would have wanted this for you? I'm not getting into this now. I'll be late for my graduation. I just don't understand why you want to do this with your life. You coming or not? OK. Fine. Three, two, one... Yay! Oh, c'mon. Another. No, I'm done now. Oh, Come on. Don't be such a girl.

 I can't. I'm going. Really? Yeah. What about a little kiss then, instead? No. Come on. Are you a lesbian or something? Come on, darling. Get off me! Let's have a little look. Get off of me! Enough! Gainham, put her down! You, get out. You, behave yourself. Yeah. Yeah?! You all right? Why are you still here? All the other girls have gone. I just wanted to... You wanted to be one of the lads? Yes, sir. You're not one of the lads. You never will be one of the lads. You need to figure out why you want to wear that uniform. I - No, I don't need to know. You do... Hm. I knew your dad. What? I knew your dad. He was a good copper. I don't want any of this carry-on at my station. Sir? L Division. Brixton. I'll be keeping my eye on you. Well, I can assure you I am. Assure me nothin', please. All you have to do is stamp the form for me. I don't have the authority to stamp that form. Bullshit! Don't give me "no authority." That's it. Out! You're with me. I need to borrow your Doris. You can have her. Woods, isn't it? Yes, sarge. I need you to deal with a female. Fuck off! Back! Just calm down! Calm down, sir. Take it easy. I'll mash up your head! All right! Sit down! Sit down on the couch! Bastard! Woods? Shit. Wrong cube. Sorry. You OK? Yeah. Who called the police? No-one. I was just next door. I was worried that somebody might have hurt you. No. Nothing like that. St Christopher kept you safe then. Stupid. My mum makes me wear it. Hm. Me too. So, what happened? My dad... He doesn't really like me being out. Where were you? Subotica. You know it? No. I mean, I know of it. You should go. It's good. I don't think they'd let me in. I'm not cool enough. They let anybody in. Why doesn't he like you going there? The crowd. Cos they let anybody in. You know, black guys. He hit you for that? Well, he didn't mean it, I suppose. No? He came in and dragged me out. But I stood up to him. And what happens when you go home? I...I don't want my dad to get in any trouble with the police. No, no, nothing like that. I can have someone go around, have a word. Maybe. Ms Woods? I'll be back in a bit. Wait for me. Yeah. I'm Denise, by the way. Amy. Hi. Hi. I'm runnin' you home. What's going on here then? What have we got? Young female, sarge. Taxi driver found her about 20 minutes ago. Oi. Hey, wait here. I met the victim at approximately 12am, but was called to X-ray. And by the time that I returned at 1.25am she was gone. Sir. What did you talk about? She'd been beaten by her father. Why? Uh, he doesn't like her being with black men. Right, well, we really don't need that in the mix. We have a report of a missing child come in this morning. Uh, "Amy Elaine Reid. White. Age 15. Dyed black hair." Call came in from the mom... Beverly. Fits the description. What do you think? I think it'll be interesting to see the father's response when we give him the death knock. OK. Anything else? I might have met him in the hospital. Who, the father? There was a man who appeared to be looking for someone. OK. Well, let's get him in and let's do a formal ID. Dismissed. Thanks, sir. Shall I set up a squad on the third floor? Why? It's obviously a domestic. Just get the dad and we'll close the case. Might be a good idea for me to take Woods along. I think she'll be good with the mother. OK, just get it done. Yeah? Yes, sir. Ready? Yeah. Mrs Reid. Yes. Wonder if we might come in and have a word, please. Come on through. Uh, you reported your daughter missing. Yes. Does she have any other distinguishing features, Mrs Reid? Maybe something you didn't mention when you called in this morning. Tattoo? Any scars? Have you found her? We found the body of a young girl. It's a possibility judging from the photographs. I'm very, very sorry. No. We need someone to make a formal identification. Where's your husband? Paul? He's out looking for Amy. You know where we might find him? I'll do it. Did he say when he'll be back? I'll do it. I want to see her. They're ready for us. I can't... I can't stand up. That's OK. Um, just hold on to me. Will you stay with me? Yeah, of course. You met her? Last night in the hospital. I told her to stay put, but... she wouldn't listen. She was in a fight. Who with? Uh, her dad. I know my husband. He has a temper, but he wouldn't do that. She, uh, she was with a friend. Young girl? Ellen Carver. She needs a priest. The sacraments. I'll look into it. Paul Reid? In Three. Uh, uh, tea. Three sugars, no milk. Beverly told me to give it to you. How's she holdin' up? She's very brave. And Amy? I mean, is she being looked after? Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. You're sure Paul Reid is not the man you saw in A&E;? I'm sure, sir. OK. Would have been nice to place him at the hospital. Still, I think we've got enough to hold him 'til we get something solid. She was with a friend. Name? Ellen Carver. There was, um, well, she went to the club with her and then I think she was at the hospital as well. Good. I'll get someone on that. Yeah. OK, five minutes. Yeah, all right. Bye. Post-mortem's ready. You can report back to Sergeant Hanratty. Sarge? Somebody waitin' for you. WPC Woods, is it? Yeah. I got your message regarding Amy. Her wind pipe is ruptured and there's deep bruising here and here caused by fingers round her neck. He was strong. And this deep mark here is most likely from a ring. She fought for her life, a lot of defensive wounds on her arms and her nails had skin under them. Yeah, her father's got a scratch mark on his face. There's a number of people coming forward from the club. Witnesses to the first incident assault. Why... What are you doing here? Uh, the family priest is here, sir. So what? Um, to give her last rites. Oh, right. Well, it'll have to wait. Make yourself useful. Do the inventory. Uh, personal belongings. You record them, bag 'em up and then take 'em back to the property room. OK. Only other thing, she had sexual intercourse at some stage of the evening. That's it. This bruising on her legs. Could the sex have been rape? It's possible. We'll say she had sex. We'll leave it at that. Wait, no, sir - Look, it's bad enough he's going down for murdering his daughter. I don't think we need to drag in the black boyfriends for questioning. I really don't want this to turn into another race thing. Right? Yes, sir. Right. Call CPS, prepare the charges. Paul Reid will be in court first thing Monday morning. Arthur, thank you. You OK? Her, um, St Christopher's medal on a chain around her neck. It's missing. Well, she was strangled. It probably snapped off. Well, then why wasn't it found with the body? You absolutely sure she had it? Positive. I'm sorry you had to see her that way. Has anyone spoken to her friend, Ellen Carver? Yeah. She says she wasn't at hospital. Well, she's lying. Ellen? Can I come in? How you getting on? I saw you at the hospital. My mom wants me to stay out of it. Of course. Do you believe in life after death? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I hope she's not angry with me. Why would she be angry with you? We're mates. We're supposed to stick together, you know. You waited for her at the hospital, didn't you? That's being a mate. Yeah. But I didn't go back with her to Subotica. Amy went back there after the hospital? She said some guy was giving her a lift. She can be a bit mental sometimes. Did you see the guy that drove her back to the club? No. Why did she want to go back there? She met a guy there. Do you know him? Sort of. He's one of the DJ's. That's him. What's his name? Colin. I think. I've charged Paul Reid with the murder of his daughter and you have run off without permission to re-interview witnesses? Ellen Carver lied. So, how does that change anything?! We still haven't accounted for this male at the nightclub. Yes, we have! She was seen with a number of young men, most of whom were witnesses to her father violently assaulting her. You see this?! This is everything I know that you don't! Paul Reid has a GBH against him, countless drunk and disorderly arrests going back years and four accounts where police have been called to intervene in domestic violence against his wife and his fucking daughter! The man was a time bomb who kills his daughter because she likes to screw black boys! Have you any idea what happens out there if he walks free?! Yes, sir. And you, Woods. What are you doing here? I don't know what's going on in that head of yours and, to be honest, I don't care. But in case you're confused about what your job is, let me remind you you are not a detective. You're not even a constable. You're a Doris. A plonk. And from now on you will sit at the desk where you belong! And you will answer the phone and you will make cups of tea. - Do you understand me? - Do you understand me?! Yeah. Get out! 'It's absolutely wide open as we go into round four. The contestants have to think quickly on their feet to solve a mind-teasing problem. And all those points now go into the master scoreboard with just one round left. And look at that. Jumping into second place.' You think that's going to help? Not now. 'From Fyvie Aberdeenshire, John MacAlistar!' I had that with your father. I don't want to go around the track with another alcoholic. Dad wasn't an alcoholic. Do you not think you've gotten yourself into enough trouble with the drink? 'Individual and then an open section on the buzzer.' Mrs Woods? That's right. Um, my name's Ray Deans. I work with Denise. Is she here? Ah, she is. Come on in. She's in here. Someone to see you. Bad time? No, no, fine. Thank you, Mum. I just wanted to see how you were doing. I'm fine. You have to hang in there, you know? Look, I want to have a look at this DJ. OK. So, what do you think? About what? Going out for a dance. To Subotica? Yeah. I think that Ferguson will have your head. Well, we're both off duty. You look great. Thanks. That's him. Give it a few minutes and, um, we'll take him outside for a quiet chat. OK. We better dance. Police. I didn't do anything. I just wanna have a word with you, Colin. Occupied. You know this girl? Well? Yeah. I got off with her, once. Kissed her, but that was it. That was it? Yeah. Uh, I heard she's only 14 and I freaked out. And then her dad comes in, goes mental, pulls her out the club shouting. We have a witness that says she came back later that night to see you. Yeah, I saw her. And? I don't know. She was dancing with other guys. Who? Don't know. And then later on I saw her crying. I took her outside to see if she was OK. She said she wanted to be by herself, so I left her to it. Can anyone verify that? Um, yeah, the doorman. The doorman? Is he working tonight? Yeah, back door. OK. Thanks. What is it? That's him. That's the guy from the hospital. It looks like he's dealing. Let's bring him in. Well? Looked through the files. Malcolm Holland has no previous. Nothing at all? Clean as a whistle. Bring him up from the cells, would you? Come on. Where did you get that? This? Friend gave it to me. You were at the hospital, weren't you? No, I wasn't. But I get that a lot. Walk. I found those drugs on the floor in the club. Decided to sell them. How did you get the marks on your neck, Malcolm? Throwing some drunk out. Goes with the job. Last night? Yeah. OK. Do you know this girl? Yeah, I've seen her. One of them little tarts from the club. Her name's Amy Reid. She was found dead yesterday morning. Sorry. She was at Subotica the night before. Colin Nash, the DJ, says you were on the back door when he came back into the club and left Amy out in the back in the car park. Yeah, I saw him go out with a bird and he came back in on his own. She was out there crying. Alone. Vulnerable. Surely it's part of your job to go out and make sure she's all right. Car park's nothing to do with me. How about the A&E;? We have a witness thinks she saw you there the same time as Amy Reid. For the record, I'd like to say the same officer accused me of that in the cells. Yeah, outside of interview. It wasn't me. I'm innocent. I've been fitted up. She has it in for me! Shut up. What did Ferguson say? Bail him while the drugs go for analysis. But - But what? He's out. That's it. Go back to the front desk. I kept your name out of it. A group of youth's gathering on your road. OK, well, I can have a car come... Hello? Yeah, one sec. You being looked after? Sorry, sir. Sorry. Um, he lied. The fingerprints results. His name's Mike Holland, not Malcolm. Yeah, we know. Malcolm's a brother. He lied to lessen the drugs charge. And your involvement in this fiasco is what exactly? But, sir, it says here that he was previously arrested for rape. Yeah, but he wasn't charged. When I saw him at the A&E...; Denise... Well, he's got St Christopher's just like the one that I saw... Oh, it looks just like. Listen to what you're telling me. You were concussed at A&E.; The St Christopher, that's circumstantial. Holland's previous arrests do not go into court with him. We've got a case. Very strong case with, with witnesses and the victim's own statement given to you before she was murdered. And all the evidence points towards one man, Paul Reid. We, the police, follow the evidence wherever it takes us. Do you understand me? Right. Here, file that. Then go home. You're suspended from duty. Can I help you? Um, Paula Merris? Yeah? WPC Woods. Can I have a quick chat? Yeah. Uh, be a few minutes. Mike Holland. He's done it again and this time the girl didn't make it. If you could give me anything. How it happened. No. I don't want to talk about it. I've put that behind me. Well, we both know that's impossible. It happened to you? Yeah. I was 17. He was a friend of the family. I was out with a mate. "Electric Blu" in Brixton Hill. I wasn't feeling very well, so I went out for some... air. Grabbed me. Choked me... ..until I passed out. I woke up in the back of his van. Pitch black. With him. I must have passed out cos I woke up in an alleyway. He uses his van. He drags them into his van and that's where he does it. That's the crime scene. 'Denise...' A woman was shot by an officer in a raid this morning. It's kicking off. We need to get around there before he's got a chance to destroy - 'We haven't got the manpower. Listen, you're suspended. Go home.' I'm going round to his address. I'm getting that van. Oh, shit. Oi, oi, open up. It's the police. Open up. Open up! Hey, hey. Denise. What the hell are you doing? He's getting rid of the evidence. Oi! OK, come on. Open up. Stop washing your van. We need to impound it. No worries. I'm all done. Why don't you charge him? With what? But the MO from the victim - Denise, listen to me, please. I'm having SOCO give it a once over. That's the best I can do. He bleached it. Yeah, and if it comes up clean you have to walk away. What, so he walks? This could get you fired. Walk away. So what the hell are we doing here? We're doing our best. Well, it's not good enough, is it? We've Armageddon on the doorstep and your presence would be appreciated. I'm coming. Van keys. You're not supposed to be here. Remember? What about the next one? What? What do we tell the parents? Sorry for your loss. What the hell do you want me to do, Denise? We're doing our best. That's all we can do. If you can't live with that you have to get out. Look, maybe the SOCO boys will find something. Who knows? 'The police are fighting to establish cordons...' 'There've been disturbances spread in all directions.' You will be arrested! Desist and return to your homes! Desist and return to your homes! 'Fires are still burning in Brixton in south London after an evening of rioting. It began as a demonstration of anger after police had shot and seriously wounded a woman while searching her house. Then a crowd attacked the police station and gangs of youths began burning and looting buildings.' We're gonna charge Holland with the murder of Amy Reid. AB-negative blood. That's a match. And some strands of hair the same colour as Amy's found in the back of the van. With everything else we've got, that's enough to go to court. Well done. Right. Well, I'll prepare the charges then. No. The press have got wind of the fact that our new WPC was involved in nicking the suspect. So, our betters at the Yard have decided that they would like to see her in front of this one. What? You don't want it? No. I want it. Yeah. Dismissed. Sir. I would like to read a statement on behalf of the Reid family. "We would like to thank the metropolitan police for all their hard work and in particular WPC Woods who's sympathetic approach and steadfast dedication brought our daughter's killer swiftly to justice. Thank you." I would also like to congratulate WPC Woods on a job well done. WPC Woods, would you like to make a statement? Denise, we can't thank you enough. This is for you. Thank you. Thank you. You OK? Yeah. Come on. Let's have a drink. Celebrate. Lauren Hines. Cause of death, strangulation. The DNA recovered from Amy's clothing confuses things. So, somebody else killed her? DPS are looking into the Holland case. Mm-hm. I think you'll find they're looking at you. 'This is BBC television from London.' Diana Princess of Wales has died after a car crash in Paris.' I promise before almighty God that my evidence shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They're tearing me apart, Ray. Subtitles by MemoryOnSmells http://UKsubtitles.ru.
