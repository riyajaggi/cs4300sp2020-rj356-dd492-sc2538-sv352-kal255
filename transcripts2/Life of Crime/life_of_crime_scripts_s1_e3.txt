 Life of Crime (2013): Season 1, Episode 3 - Episode #1.3 - full transcript 
 Denise,her rank restored and about to interview for superintendent,reacts badly when ex-husband Ray tells her that Charlotte is pregnant and throws herself into investigating the murder of Joanna Andrews. To her surprise she finds DNA connected to Mike Holland and discovers from CCTV footage that he was in a van near the murder scene. She works out that there was another man with him at the gig Joanna attended,justifying her view that all three of the murders over the years involved an accomplice. Denise's protégée DC Jay Tomlin offers herself as bait at the club where Holland works and flushes out the identity of the accomplice,who is arrested. Jay is snatched by Holland but rescued by Denise,who,the case resolved,gets her promotion and reconciles with Charlotte,who comes to stay with her.

 Where were you? Subotica. I'm Denise, by the way. Amy. She was found dead yesterday morning. It wasn't me. I'm innocent. I'm being fitted up. She has it in for me! Maybe the SOCO boys'll find something. We're going to charge Holland with the murder of Amy Reid. We can't thank you enough. This is for you. Diana, Princess of Wales, has died after a car crash in Paris.

 Lauren Hines. Cause of death, strangulation. And the fact this other guy's DNA is on both girls... Well, it's got to throw the whole Amy Reid conviction into doubt. We will of course be seeking substantial damages from the police service, who brought about this miscarriage of justice. I planted the evidence, Ray. I'm sorry, Ray. I didn't know that we were going to have a life together then. Yeah, but we did! I know. Please, Ray, I really... I really need you right now. I'm sorry. Ray, please, no. Please don't go. I need you. I missed one of Amy Reid's killers. It is my belief that Holland acted as an accomplice. This is not the time or place. We've missed him again and again. You didn't do it, did you? You killed her, but didn't rape her.

 Guv! Those letters to Holland. Someone else was involved. The interview's been terminated! You were an accomplice. Who the fuck was it? Why did you admit it? I've been Detective Chief Inspector in Brixton since December 2009. And I've worked there for all my career. I understand the borough not through theory, but through experience. I know that the promotion of a superintendent means taking a step back from the more hands-on job that I'm currently doing as Detective Chief Inspector in Brixton. I've given more than 20 years to the Met, and I've worked from the ground up. I know that the job of a uniformed officer on the street is as important as a detective in CID. Because I've been there. I have the experience. How long you been a Special, Brownlow? Nine months, ma'am. How're you finding it? Good. I mean, I wanna join the regulars. It's just... this is the only way. Ma'am. I'm gonna have her moved now. Keep up the good work. Thank you, ma'am. S01E03 Life of Crime Scott S Look, I... er... I'm aware of the mistakes that I've made. And I've learnt from them. Without them, I don't think I would be the woman that I am today. And I certainly wouldn't be the officer that I am today. OK. Thank you. We'll let you know. Thank you. Sorry, ma'am. Shouldn't you be at the morgue, DC Tomlin? Yes. Looking after the body of... Joanna Andrews, yes. Well? I was wondering if there'll be an investigation? There is an investigation. No, I mean... You requested a senior officer visit the crime scene. I have. I can see no evidence of a struggle or foul play. Would you like me to canvass her friends? No, Uniform are doing that. More than likely, she was on drugs, strayed from her friends at the gig, fell, knocking herself unconscious, and choked on her own vomit. Sad, but... What do you think was unusual enough to call me out? I...don't think she looks the type. Go on. She looked pretty streetwise. And she had a bag of pills on her. Trust me, a girl like that goes out a lot. She'd know her limits. Ma'am. We'll wait for toxicology. And until then she's NFA'd? Further action has been taken. So she's not on hold because you don't have the budget? No. I don't have the budget for a full-blown murder investigation without compelling evidence of foul play. I don't even have the budget for you. Or for this conversation. But you are still here, and I'm still talking, long after you should be getting on with it. Go! Yes, ma'am. Hey. Hi, Carol. Come in, you look great. Thank you. Hey. Hey. Come in. Erm... I'll just check in the kitchen. Smells great. Take your coat? Yeah, sure. So, you planning to stay for the whole break? Yeah, probably. We might go and see Liam's parents in Ireland. Where are they? Dublin. My mum'll be up there smiling about that. I'm sure. Erm... Liam does English at Kings, too. Well, it's nice to put a face to a name, Liam. Likewise. Charlotte talks about you a lot. I see you've repainted the hall. Carol has, yeah. Very nice. Thanks. This is great, by the way. Yeah, lovely, thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. I don't do it as well as Ray, but... It's really good, honestly. Wine, Liam? Thanks, yeah. Not for me, thanks. Of course. Thanks. Am I the last to know? What did you expect? Wow. How far along are you? Twelve weeks. Almost. I just... I want you to think long and hard about what you're doing. You have got so much ahead of you. Oh, what? You think it's only 14-year-old girls on council estates have babies this young? That's a bit Tory, even for a copper. I am also your mother. Are you? I wish you would start acting like one. All I'm saying, is that I don't want you to do something that you're gonna regret. And all I wanted was for you to say, "I'm here for you." I think you'd better go. Charlotte! Don't worry, it's fine. What did you say? What did I - What am I supposed to say, Ray? Why are you angry with me? Because you should have told me, in private. Not in front of everyone. Charlotte wanted to tell you to your face, with Liam. Well, why didn't she? Because I said she should do it here. And Carol... You know, she wanted to make it special. Yeah, well, Carol's made that very special. Excuse me?! Thank you, Carol! Carol, no. No, Ray! We've done all we can to involve you in this. We've done all this to help Charlotte give you the news. Yeah. You're in our home. Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but this isn't your business. This is my daughter. And I'll remind you, that everything you have in your home used to be mine. I know! And you didn't want it. You walked. Alright. Enough, please. Yeah, what is it? Ma'am, we found a van. Why are you telling me this? There was a parking permit in it. For the gig. What? Where the body of Joanna Andrews was found. Well, let Traffic deal with it. The vehicle was a hire van and it was leased to a 'Mike Holland'. I checked him on Crim-Int. Ma'am? I'm here. The toxicology came back, and Joanna Andrews had MDMA in her system consistent with the pills. But she also had a high level of GHB. The date rape drug. Yeah, I know what it is. Sorry. I just thought you should know. Right, OK. I want you to fast track the DNA swabs. I wanna know if there was any sexual activity, and I wanna know tonight. OK. OK. Physical examination results from Joanna Andrews shows signs of aggressive sexual intercourse. Swabs of sweat and saliva found on Joanna's neck show a DNA match. It's unidentified, but the same offender's DNA has been linked to two other cases. Lauren Hines. Raped and murdered in Brixton in 1997. And Amy Reid, raped and murdered in Brixton in 1985. They were my cases. I was the one who put Stephen Forrester away for the murder of Lauren Hines. I knew then that he was working with someone that we missed. It looks like that someone is still out there. Mike Holland. I don't see his name here. It's not in there. He was at the gig where Joanna's body was found. He's connected. How? As yet it's circumstantial. You hand it over to someone else. You cannot go anywhere near Holland. Even an interview will look like a personal vendetta. Presumably we should at least look at Holland. Rule him out. Let's be clear here. This could more than harm your promotion. I'm telling you, Denise. Leave it alone. Thank you, sir. Can I have a quick word? I need you to track down a Special for me. Brownlow, I think his name is. Yes, ma'am. I'm going to be looking into the death of Joanna Andrews, unofficially. I could do with your help. But I understand if you want to walk away. This investigation is not officially sanctioned. And if there's any fallout, there are limits to how much I can protect you both. OK. Are you treating it as a murder? A suspicious death. What do we have to go on? Well, I believe that these rape-murders are the results of two men working together. Selecting and abducting as a team. In 1997, it was Stephen Forrester. But in 1985 and now... Mike Holland. Yes. And I believe Holland is working again with this unknown individual whose DNA's on all the girls. Brownlow, check CCTV around the park, see if you can find Joanna. Yes, ma'am. Ma'am. Traffic ran a trace on Holland's van. The registered address on his driving licence is his brother's house. We were in the same foster home till I reached 11. Then we were split. And what about work? He had that one job for years. Working nights at the depot down in Bermondsey cleaning trains out. He loved that job. And what happened? An accusation was made. Some young woman who fell asleep on the platform said she woke to find him... Well, you know. Touching her. But he wasn't charged for that? No. A work colleague backed up Mike's version of events. That he was just trying to wake her up. But he still lost his job over it? You know what it's like. Once an accusation like that's made... Did he have any close friends back then? Not that I know of. Just that one mate at work. Do you have a name? No, never met him. Files you requested, ma'am. And I need you to sign for them too, please. Thanks, Harry. You're welcome, ma'am. - Hi. - Can you talk? I'm sorry about last night. Is Carol OK? Yeah, she'll be fine. How's Charlotte? I'm not sure, I can't get a thing out of her. It's like... I dunno, it's like I'm a bad guy. ...transit. S Reg. You called to tell me I could pick it up. Denise. Look, I never ask anything of you, but we need to sit down and talk about this properly. Yeah. Erm, look, Ray, I'm going to have to call you back later. No, Denise. We need to talk about it now. Trust me, Ray, this really isn't a good time. I'm so sorry. Look, all I'm asking for is five minutes for your family. No, I... I want to talk, it's just, I... I can't right now. I'm sorry. Ma'am. Holland's van is contracted to the company BB Sounds. They supply lighting and sound equipment. Equipment for gigs? That makes sense. Good opportunity to spot potential for new victims. Women on their own. Drunk, off guard. Also, Brownlow was going through CCTV looking for Joanna Andrews. No sign of her, but he found Holland's van. There's Holland. Who's he talking to? We don't know. Get forensics onto it. Already on it. I figured you couldn't hang up on me this way. Come in. If you've come here to vent, Ray, I don't think I can deal with it after the day that I've had. Charlotte needs you to get involved with this pregnancy. Charlotte needs her space. She needs her mum. I'm struggling with it too, Denise. I... But we make our own way in life. You... you did. What's this? Amy Reid? Erm, well, I'm looking into the death of... Joanna Andrews. And you think the cases are connected? What does the Super think about that then? You're doing it on the QT? Do you have any idea what they'll do to you if they find out? Yeah, I do. You're obsessed, Denise. What have you got on him? And don't say, "who?" Er... right now, only circumstantial. Then why? It's not like it's kept you down, has it? Is clearing your name really that important? You're going to put these families through all that again? Including your own? You're that selfish? No, it's not about me. The night that I met Amy, I knew that I was supposed to help her. But somewhere along the way... it all fell apart. Yeah, what is it? OK, thank you. The forensics from Holland's van. The skin and the hair on the passenger seat, it's a match. The same unknown DNA on all three victims. This is the guy you've been chasing all these years? He was with Holland. They were together last night. I ran the MO and signature you drew up. Three in the last six months. All turned up at hospitals with memory loss. Blood showed GHB. And examinations revealed intercourse, but no DNA. All three were NFA'd. Did you go back further? Four years. Nothing. Two of the girls said something about being separated from their friends. Being alone. All three happened at music festivals or gigs. Same victimology, same setups. That's just it. Brownlow got in touch with Holland's employers. They gave me their bookings list. They're supplying a gig tonight. A club in Bermondsey. And Holland's working? Yes, ma'am. Ma'am, I think this could be our chance. Let me go in and lure him out. Thank you, Brownlow. Can you give us a minute? I read the victim profile you drew up. I know how to present. It's too risky. We can't just stand by and watch this happen to another young girl. Yeah? Thanks, DC Tomlin. Carol, is everything okay? She's in there. Can I come in? I'm sorry about the other night. I've broken up with him. OK. Does your dad know? Was I planned? Planned? Um... I suppose... I mean, maybe you came along a bit earlier than we expected. I don't remember you. At home. When you still lived here. Well... I made my choices. And you have to make yours. Can I stay with you? Charlotte, I... Mum, please. You know, I've never asked you for anything. I just thought this time you might step up. Work comes first. As usual. You're never going to give up on this case, are you? Holland did it. I know he did. And I just... I'm as close to him now as I'm ever going to get. I want to help. Thanks. Nice to see you again. How's Paul? Do you hear from him? A card at Christmas. And on the anniversary, of course, we both turn up at Amy's grave. I'm sorry about you two. It was just... Too much pain, you know? When you lose a child... ..they never really leave you. She'll never be truly gone. I wish I could have known her better. Me too. I mean, I knew the child, the little girl. But... ..I didn't really know the teenager. Your little girl must be... 19. She doing well? She's pregnant. But she is at university, so that's something, I suppose. Are you close? I broke up with her father when she was little. And he took custody. Or I gave him custody. I didn't know that. I'm sorry. It was a hard time. My mum had just died. And... My head was a bit of a mess. Then Holland got out. Yeah. He's caused us both a lot of pain. Beverley, there's another reason that I'm here. You're after him again, aren't you? Yeah. And I just... He's already caused so much damage. Make him pay. There he is. Radio check. Jay's approaching now. How you doing, all right? Brilliant. I see you got here five minutes early. Yeah, I left early because... I'm not sure why I left early! Why would you just leave the house without telling me? We're going out together, and you just decide to leave the house. And you didn't even say why. What were you thinking? I've been in the mood all day long, that's why! "I've been in the mood all day long?" Yeah. I've been in the mood all fucking week! What is wrong with you? You just leave the house without telling me. Fine. Calm down, you're making a scene. I'm making a scene? I'm making a scene?! Yeah, calm down. Have a good night, yeah? Don't talk to me like that! Are you OK? What? I just wondered if you're OK? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - Thanks. Don't let it ruin your night. Yeah, I'll try. Go on, let me get you a drink on the house. Do you know what, I should probably go home. Hey, come on. Cheer up, and have a good time. What do you want? Vodka lemonade, please. Okie-doke. There you are. Thanks. I tell you what. If you don't end up having the best night of your life, I'll make them give you your money back. How's that? All right. Thanks. See you later, yeah? Yeah. Do you work here? Yeah. Cool. I've got the drink, I think he's heading for the back room. I know you. Don't think so. From Subotica. Colin Nash. Hey! No you don't! Search him. OK, cuff him, Brownlow. Open your mouth, sir. Keys, wallet, mobile phone. I've done a sweep of the club. Looks like Holland's gone. Thought I'd take a quick look at the car park. OK. And then get straight back to the station. Yes, ma'am. I'm on my way. Mr Nash, when searching your pockets, we uncovered a paper wrap containing powder residue that we now know to be GHB. Can you tell me anything about that? No comment. We also recovered from the club a glass, which a witness states you gave to a young woman. The glass contains an alcoholic beverage laced with GHB. Can you tell me anything about that? No comment. Mr Nash, can you recall where you were the night of 26 September, 1985? No comment. Did you, with an accomplice, Mike Holland, abduct, rape, and murder Amy Reid? Do you recall where you were the night of August 26, 1997? Did you, with an accomplice, Stephen Forrester, abduct, rape, and murder Lauren Hines? No comment. Can you account for where you were the night before last? No comment. Did you abduct, rape, and murder Joanna Andrews with accomplice, Mike Holland? No comment. I'm going to keep him in until his CPS officer arrives in the morning. All right. Ma'am? What is it, Harry? It's Nash's phone. "Bd 20 minutes"? Where's DC Tomlin? She said she was going to meet me back here. She said she was right behind me. I'll go back. No, he'll be gone. I'll check at the front desk. No, he... there's no answer. He marked her. Nash marked her for Holland. I'll put out a call to all units in the area. Harry, pull up the details on Holland's van. See if you can get a click on an AMPR machine. Yes, ma'am. In a few minutes, I'll have someone get you out of here. Take you back down to your cell. Anything to add? I've been looking for you for a long time. And now here you are. Here I am. We discounted you. We looked right past you. Do you want to know why? Because it doesn't make any sense. Amy was crazy about you. She would have gone home with you willingly. I bet any of those girls would. There's no tape. It's just you and me. You honestly want to know why? Because I don't want their fucking permission. I never did. Holland feels the same? I don't care how he feels. But he did time for you. Guys like Holland, Forrester, they need someone like me. Guys like Holland? Weak men. When we first worked together, Mike got caught feeling up this girl who'd fallen asleep in the station. She woke up and screamed at him. He was in tears. Anyway. I gave him an alibi. And it all blew over. That must have meant a lot to him. When we left Bermondsey, he swore he'd do anything for me. You were the one who covered for him in Bermondsey. At the depot, yeah. Why? Bermondsey depot. BD. Thank you. Holland's heading for the train depot on Albion Road. Shit. We're never gonna make it. We have to. Lemur Delta Five Remainder Delta. All recieved. Lemur Delta Five Remedia Nine Nine. We are over you and have a visual on a blue transit close to your location. Currently at Hartham Street junction. All right, let's get up to Lancaster and cut through. Oi! Watch it, Denise! I know what I'm doing, Ray. Let's cut across. Go left. That left! Come on! Out of the way! There he is! If he's heading for the depot, he'll turning onto Harbecker. I'll cut him off. Lemur Delta from Lemur Delta Five, we're following a blue Ford Transit van. Index S, Sierra, containing suspect Mike Holland. He's on Harbecker Street heading north towards Albion Road train depot. Over. All units in the vicinity of Harbecker Street... You're gonna spook him! We've got him! We've got him! Ease off. Woah! What are you doing?! We've got him. Come on, move! Move! Stay back, or I'll cut her throat! I need to talk to him. We should wait for back-up! No, she'll be dead by then. Stay back, I'll do it! You remember her? Amy Reid. Do you remember her? We've got Nash. We've got his DNA. It'll connect him to three dead girls, Mike. No, you're lying. How do you think I knew where to find you? You think I won't do it, huh? Mike. Look at her. I know that you worked together at the depot. I know that's where you first met each other. Do you know what he said about you? He said you were weak. He said that you cried. 30 years you've been protecting him. You went to prison for him. And he doesn't give a shit about you. He never did, Mike. He never cared. Are you OK? Make your arrest, he's all yours. Mike Holland, you are under arrest. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you fail to mention when questioned something you may later rely on in court. Do you understand? Right, come on. Get in. "I understand you were fully aware of the risks involved in going after Holland again." "The CPS have charged him, and the evidence is extremely compelling." "You're finishing your career as a DCI on a high, Denise." "It falls on me to tell you that you have been offered the post of Superintendent." Charlotte. 12 weeks, two days. April 25th. Hey. Hey. So? Is it true? You're the new Superintendent? Yeah. Look, Charlotte. Come and stay with me. I don't need you to look after me - I know. I want you to. I want you to come and stay.
