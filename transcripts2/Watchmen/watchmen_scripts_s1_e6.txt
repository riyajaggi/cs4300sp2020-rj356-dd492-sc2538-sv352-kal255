AUTOMATED VOICE: Welcome to your family tree. These are your great grandparents, tragically killed in the massacre of 1921. (PANICKED SCREAMS) If you want her to know who you are, just tell her. She's not gonna listen.

 What are these? I was hoping you could ask your ex. It's Nostalgia. They outlawed those. So I highly recommend you tell your lady-friend not to take them. These are memories. Whose memories? They're my grandfather's. LAURIE BLAKE: Show me your hands! Cuff her. Now. - What did you fucking do?! - I had to. ♪ (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) ♪ ♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪

 (CIGARETTE SIZZLES) (EXHALING) MAN: Hooded Justice. It all started with you. You're the alpha, pal. It was your idea to put on that mask and fight crime. As fellow enforcers of the law, I got to tell you what an honor it is to sit across from you right now. Captain Axis, King Mob, Moloch... The worst villains in the city, all in jail thanks to you and your buddies, the Minutemen. (CHUCKLES) You're true American heroes, all of yous. But you, Hooded Justice, you most of all because, like I said, you were the first. Hey, help us settle a bet. What's the story with that noose around your neck? See, I-I think it's an executioner thing. You know, let your enemies know you mean business. But, Jerry here... Jerry, how about you tell him what you think that noose is for? Sex stuff. - What do you want from me? - AGENT: We want you to take that fucking hood off so we can take a photo of your beautiful face. Never. Look, pal, we don't know who you are, but we know what you do, and... who you do. (AGENTS SNICKER) Captain Metropolis, aka Nelson Gardner, aka your fairy princess. He's got a safe behind the painting of the white horse in his boudoir. Now, in that safe is a roll of film. Jerry, you wanna tell him what's on that film? Sex stuff. AGENT: That's right. Your boyfriend has got other boyfriends, and he's trying to blackmail Director Hoover just because he bears a passing resemblance to the fellow Captain Bigcockalus is violating on that film. A fellow who is not Director Hoover because Director Hoover is not a depraved homosexual. So, you're gonna bring us that film, and we're gonna rip up the photo we're about to take of you. Why should I trust you? Because Jerry and me, we won't show it to anybody. Hell, nobody even knows we're here with you right now. This is all hush-hush. Just the way you like it, sweetheart. So... what do you say, HJ? (SIGHS) (EXHALES) AGENT: Well, well. Ain't you pretty. Jerry... you wanna do the honors? Say cheese. (JERRY GRUNTS) Aah! (GRUNTING) (SCREAMS) (AGENTS GROANING) Cheese. HOODED JUSTICE: I should probably be worried that I just murdered two federal agents, but all I could think about is that Nelson Gardner is cheating on me, with J. Edgar Hoover no less... - Turn that shit off. - (TV TURNS OFF) OFFICER: How's Detective Abar? Agent Blake, is she okay? - Is that the release? - Yeah. Um, you really need to get her to sign it, now. And you need to move her to an actual hospital before goes into a coma. She needs help! (GATE CLICKS) You shouldn't have swallowed your grandfather's pills, Angela. You wanna tell me where he is? (SIGHS) Do you know how Nostalgia works? Or how they make it? You know, they insert these little chips into your brain, and they harvest your memories. And then they put them in a little pill and you pop one, and you get to experience that shit all over again. It was supposed to be for older folks, you know, dementia treatment, but that limited the market because, you know, who wants to be in the present when you can live in the past? Well, you know the rest. People got hooked, dependency, ODs. So, Redford and the FDA outlawed it, and the company that made it had to stop. And do you know who owns that company? (ECHOES): Lady Trieu. (DISTORTS): Coincidence. Hey, maybe she knows your Grandpa. (ECHOES): Grandpa. Those were his pills you swallowed, Angela. (ECHOES): That's very, very bad... You're not supposed to take someone else's Nostalgia. You need to sign this release so we can get your stomach pumped. I can't do it without your consent. (BLAKE'S VOICE DISTORTS, ECHOES) Angela? You're about to turn into a vegetable. (BLAKE'S VOICE DISTORTS, ECHOES) (DRUM ROLLING) (BLAKE'S VOICE DISTORTS, ECHOES) (ECHOES): Is it starting?

(ECHOES): Where is your grandfather?! Where? Where is he? (DRUM ROLLING) I want you to think about what you're wearing, what you put on when you wake up, what you take off when you go to bed. The uniform a man wears changes him. Make sure yours changes you for the better. And God bless you for taking an oath... to uphold the law... - and honor the badge. - (APPLAUSE) Do us proud.

Congratulations, son. Do us proud. Be safe out there. Looks like I get the honor of putting a badge on you. - What's your name, Officer? - William Reeves, sir, and the honor is mine, Lieutenant Battle. I joined the force because of you. (CHUCKLING): Sorry to hear that. (WHISPERS): Beware of the Cyclops. - What? - Congratulations, son. Do us proud. Be safe out there. ♪ ♪ - (BAND PLAYING JAZZ MUSIC) - (PATRONS CHATTERING) - Here you go, June. - (MUSIC ENDS) - (APPLAUDING) - Thank you, Officer. Thanks for coming today. Meant a lot to see a friendly face. I was there for work, not you. So, why are you writing your story about me? Because the Amsterdam says a Negro cadet making the force is big news. So, I'm big news. You're a big something, but it ain't news, Officer. - You gonna keep calling me that? - If you don't want me to call you officer, you probably should've chosen a different line of work. All right. Let me have it. - Let you have what? - I know what you're thinking. JUNE: What am I thinking? WILL: I've joined the enemy. The police in this city smother our people under their shoes. Lieutenant Battle is a Tom, and now I am a Tom too. They just hired me for the publicity. And besides all of that, you're worried about me. They gave you a gun and a stick. That's what I'm worried about. What you're gonna do with them. Because you are an angry, angry man, William Reeves. I'm not angry. - (DEBRIS CLATTERING) - (ENGINE ROARING) It's okay. Most of us are. I'm young, I'm healthy, I got the job I always wanted. What have I got to be angry about? Folks were murdered right in front of you.

What's your name? Fred. Now, if you'll excuse me, I wanna get home in time for Amos 'n' Andy. I saw what you did. Oh, you mean at that fine Jewish delicatessen over there? You know, I heard they have a rat problem. Maybe one chewed through the wires, started a fire. You're under arrest. - Oh... (SIGHS) - (HANDCUFFS CLICK) I seriously doubt that. I'm booking this man for arson. He burned down a delicatessen - on Jamaica Avenue. - That is not what happened, sir. I was just out for an evening constitutional. OFFICER: Mm-hmm. Must be a case of mistaken identity. That's a lie. I saw him do it with my own eyes! - Everything okay? - WILL: Yes, it's fine. Fellas, this spook is accusing me of a horrendous crime. Who you gonna believe, me or him? What'd you just call our fellow officer? Nothing. - Sorry, I... - Don't apologize to me. You apologize to him. I'm so sorry. - We'll book this fink. - But Reeves made the arrest. - We got it from here. - Yeah. - Sure, okay. - Good work, Officer Reeves. ♪ ♪ - Beats the news, huh? - Yeah. More hopeful. - What's it about? - A boy, a baby, his-his father put him in a rocket ship and sent him to Earth just before - his planet explodes. - (PLANE ENGINE ROARS) - (EXPLOSION) - Young WILL: Will you come, too? WILL'S MOTHER: We're gonna be right behind you. (SMACKS) Hey! Pardon me, Officer. - You let him go? - Let who go? The man I brought in for burning down a deli. Fred. Sorry. I got no idea what you're talking about. What? You were standing right there! The other officers took the guy to book him. I think you're having memory problems, Reeves. My memory is fine. Just let it be, okay? I saw them do this to you. What does this mean? What is it? It's gonna be the hole in your head if you don't let it be. I'm trying to help you out here, Reeves.

Hey yourself! - What time is it? - Three. Already been to work and back. I didn't wanna wake you. How is it? It hurts. You were in the paper this morning. Calling you a hero. What? "Had the hero not intervened," both victims of the attack were convinced they would not have survived the encounter. However, the identity of their mysterious "hooded savior remains unknown." (SIGHS) Hmm. Why'd you put it on? The hood. I already told you. The cops put it on... Yeah, but then you put it back on. Why? I don't know. What's the name of that picture? - Huh? - (NEWSPAPER SMACKS) Stop saying "huh." The movie, the one you watched over and over when you were a boy. You used to tell me about it all the time. - Oh. Trust in the Law. - Trust in the Law, that's the one. Tell me how it ends. (PIANO PLAYING HURRY MUSIC) There's a sheriff on a horse. He's shooting at somebody riding after him. It's a man all in black, a man in a hood. And he's got a lasso, and he throws it at the sheriff. Pulls the sheriff right off his horse. And they're in front of the church now, and doors burst open and all the townsfolk come running out to see what's going on. The man in black tells them the sheriff's no good. Cattle thief. He's stealing from the town. And now they ask the man who he is. He throws his hood back, and it's Bass Reeves, the black marshal of Oklahoma. He shows his badge. The townsfolk cheer. - JUNE: They cheer for him, huh? - WILL: Yeah. And they start shouting for him to string up the sheriff, but Bass Reeves won't have it. "There will be no mob justice today. Trust in the law." What color were those townsfolk? White. Tell me, what happened to the Dreamland Theatre, where you watched that picture, over and over, while your mama played the piano? What'd the Klan and the fine white citizens of Tulsa do? (GUNSHOT ECHOES) They burned it down. You ain't gonna get justice with a badge, Will Reeves. You gonna get it with that hood. And if you wanna stay a hero, townsfolk gonna need to think one of their own's under it. You sure you wanna do this?

You may be confused as to who you are right now, or when or where, but you're still at the precinct. You're not moving, but your eyes are wide open. It's kinda fucking freaky, Angela. If you can hear what I'm saying right now, I need you to blink. Good. That's great. Angela, I-I've got Cal here with me, your husband. He's gonna read something to you that they said would help get you out of this, or you're gonna fall right back in. Blink if you can still hear me. (ECHOING): Your name is Angela Abar. (IN NORMAL VOICE): You were born in Saigon in 1976. I'm your husband, Calvin. We met in Vietnam. Now, we live in Tulsa. We have three children, Topher, Emma, and Rosie. The year is 2019. The president is Robert Redford. You need to come home now. You need to... You need to wake up. I love you. Your name is Angela Abar. (DISTANTLY): You were born in Saigon in 1976...

Officer Reeves, I'm Nelson Gardner, sir. Pleasure to meet you. Uh, this is my wife, June. Mrs. Reeves. If you don't mind excusing us, - I'm hoping to discuss some business with your... - Oh! Business! How can I help you, Mr. Gardner? I'm here on behalf of a costumed adventurer named Captain Metropolis. Have you heard of him? - Costumed adventurer? - Yes. Crime fighting in disguise. It's a new phenomenon, but it's growing at a brisk clip. Captain Metropolis would like to capitalize on that growth by forming a team. Patriots, heroes. They call themselves the New Minutemen. It's a great group of fellows, and there's even a couple of ladies. I'm sorry, but I don't understand what this has got to do with me. The team is incomplete without the hero who inspired them. Hooded Justice. Captain Metropolis is a master of strategy. He scrutinized the different locations where Hooded Justice appeared, and cross-referenced them with patrols of local police. - So, you think he's a cop? - No. I believe a cop is feeding him intelligence about criminal activity. But you know all about this, Officer Reeves, because that cop is you. (LAUGHING) I'm sorry? I didn't mean that as a joke. Mind if I ask, is this strategic mastermind, Captain Metropolis, blond? About your height? I... I don't understand what you're implying... - What does the word "cyclops" mean to you? - Not much. Is it some kind of underground criminal enterprise that Hooded Justice is investigating? Well, if you consider the Ku Klux Klan a criminal enterprise, then yes. And they're planning something. Sounds like a job for the Minutemen all right. Let's say I do know Hooded Justice. - Why should he join your team? - He shouldn't. He should join because brave men like him are rare specimens. Why fight alone, when you could have true companionship? Well, I have overstayed my welcome. But I hope you do know Hooded Justice, Officer Reeves. If only to tell him what a huge admirer. Captain Metropolis is. Something tells me they have a lot in common. Good evening, Mrs. Reeves. Again, I am... so sorry to have intruded. I'll see myself out. (DOOR OPENS, CLOSES) No. - Yes! Yes!

Fighting crime in league with the Hooded Justice. Your participation legitimizes the whole operation, and they know it. What they can't know, of course, is your secret. Some of them aren't as... tolerant as I am. You'll have to be sure you're covered up. Wear the makeup and hood, at all times. Actually, I... was hoping we could try something on the next go-around.

Tell me about the first time you saw me. - Come on, June, not again... - Tell me. I woke up in the tall grass and... there was a wrecked car off in the distance. Tulsa was on fire. I thought I was the only person still alive in the whole world. But then I heard a cry, so... - I walked to it. - (BABY CRYING) And there was a baby wrapped up in an American flag, - so I picked it up. - (BABY CRYING) And I said... - you're okay. - You're okay.

GARDNER (OVER PHONE): Come down where? WILL: The meatpacking district. There was a riot in a theater. Cyclops is using film projectors to turn Negroes against each other. I followed them to a warehouse. GARDNER (OVER PHONE): So, this is your vast and insidious conspiracy? William, you of all people should know. The residents of Harlem cause riots all on their own. No, no! This is real! It's some kind of mesmerism. That book I found... - Cyclops is... - Yes, yes, yes. Cyclops, Cyclops, Cyclops. Dear God. So, the Klan is using mind control? Do you have any idea how ridiculous that sounds? Have you been drinking? - No. - Well, maybe you should be. Come over. You can bring your red file and we can talk about it. I don't want to come over. You need to get the others and come down and help me. You said you would help me. I'm sorry, William, but this sort of thing isn't really the Minutemen's cup of tea.
