 What's the matter? They found a corpse in the ice house, Anne's been arrested, Jane's coming home! - I meant with you. - You don't miss much! I'm good at keeping secrets. Aren't we all My ex considered me terribly frivolous. When he loved me, he found it quite attractive. Maybe it's time you moved on from here. Who else would put up with me? Humiliation doesn't get any easier the older you get. Did my mother ever love my father? Yes, of course she did. She was besotted with him. We all were.

 - He was a bastard, wasn't he? - Leave it. It's over. I knew he hit her. I used to put my head under the pillow. What else could you have done? One night he screamed he'd only married her because of the baby. If I hadn't been born, none of this would have started. - She detests me. - That's stupid! Phoebe adores you. She'd give up her life for you and Jane. She marks the drinks bottles! She's on her guard all the time, watching me. It wasn't my fault she married him! I tried to take care of her, didn't I? - You did. - Why won't she tell me what's going on? - How do you mean? - Was it my father in the ice house? Course not. - So where is he? - I don't know. - What happened to him? - Nobody knows!

 She's frightened I'll turn out like him. You are nothing like your father. I'm a male. I'm a Maybury. Who knows what I might do? Don't, Bill. You can go, Miss Cattrell. There's a car for you. Well, what do you say? Shall we sue? We're embarrassed for choice. Harassment, abuse of police powers, damage to your professional reputation. I've a mind to charge you both with wasting police time. No, I do the charging. 50 quid every time I draw breath. I win, however you look at it. - How did it go? - They just left. Did you see them? - No. - It was beef blood. We've been had. - The question is, why? - Diversion. To draw us away from the house. It didn't work. There wasn't a stone unturned when we finished. Robinson found this lot in Mrs Goode's studio. - Did he question her about it? - She said it was none of his business. When he wanted to take the letters, she tried to snatch them back. "Monday. My dearest Diana, of course I regret what's happened, but my hands are tied. "I can come out on Thursday to discuss things. Daniel." - When did Thompson go missing? - 25th of August. The day he made an appointment with Mrs Goode. I've got a couple of lads to tout those shoes round the menders. I reckon they're the missing Daniel's. It's too much of a coincidence. - Have you questioned Mrs Goode? - Tomorrow. Let's let her sweat a little. - Anne! - When did you get here? - Mum picked me up this afternoon. - How's my favourite god-daughter? - Fine. - You look it. Fetch me a brandy. I am suffering from severe post-interrogation trauma. - What's the matter with you lot? - We were worried sick! You should have more faith. - Isn't there something on television? - For God's sake! Jonathan! Why did they take you in? They found the safe and it had incriminating evidence in it. A bloody carving knife! It was straight out of Enid Blyton, but they got terribly excited! - You're mad! What on earth were you up to? - An insurance policy! Can't you take this seriously? God knows what they think. What didn't you want them to find? Nothing desperate. Just the odd document which shouldn't be in my possession. It's more than Walsh had on me and he didn't let up for a moment. Walsh's face when Bill talked about suing for harassment! You think you're so bloody clever! At least I don't have hysterics if anything goes wrong! Don't start, please! I'm sick of being sneered at. You're out of it, but it's me they'll come down on next. What could they possibly have on you? Diana? - I hoped you'd never have to find out. - Just tell us! We're in this together. Nothing's changed. We help each other. I was persuaded to part with £20,000 to this man. - Half my savings down the drain. - What man? Can't you get it back? No, he's done a bunk! From my correspondence, the police must think they've found him in the ice house! - Who is he? - Daniel Thompson, an engineer. He got my number from that design consultant in Winchester. - I hope he was worth 20 grand! - It wasn't like that! All right, we just were friends, that's all. I invested some money in a business of his. Strictly legitimate. Now it's gone bust. Why on earth didn't you talk to us? You were both away. Daniel and I discussed it. By the time you came back, I'd forgotten about it. Then everything started to go wrong. And I couldn't bear you two banging on about how stupid I'd been. - Did you kill him? - Anne! Just checking! She's got a hell of a temper! What business was it? - You'll laugh. - No, we won't. - I'll kill you if you do. - Pact. See-through radiators. - Sorry, did I frighten you? - Why didn't you use the front door? - Can I sit down? - No! All right, yes, sit down. What are you doing here? - I just wanted to talk to you. - What about? Anything. Eternity. Split-particle physics. Safes. Someone's been here before me. You? Not you. Someone else. - Will you tell me what was in there? - No. - Who removed it? - No. Very neat. - Well? - Well, what? What are you planning to do? I don't know. Find out who cleared it out and ask them a few questions. The inspector ordered a constable to be here while I was away. I've nothing to tell you. You're wasting your time. You've got lots to tell me. Why you came to Streech. Why Mrs Phillips calls this place a fortress. And what was behind your safe. - Did Walsh send you? - I'm not your enemy, Cattrell. If you're not my enemy, McLoughlin, drop me, drop all of us from the inquiry and look for your murderer somewhere else. But you can't, can you? No, you're a policeman and you love justice more. I told you this morning I sympathise with personal vengeance. You helped me. I'd like to help you. - But I can't if you won't trust me. - Trust ME, McLoughlin. I don't need your help. I'm as innocent of personal revenge and murder as a baby. Did you cut his balls off? No! You could be lying and I couldn't see it. I'm telling the truth. Why is that so difficult to believe? Because my crotch is ruling my brain. - What do you plan to do about it? - You tell me. Cold showers? My advice is, when you've got an itch, scratch it. I'd enjoy it a lot more if YOU scratched it. What about your wife? She left me. - Did you have the sense to eat anything? - Sausage and chips about five hours ago. Well, I'm starving. There's an Indian take-away just down the road. How do you fancy discussing your options over a vindaloo? I'm not your type, McLoughlin. I'm selfish, opinionated, incapable of sustaining a relationship, I'm often unfaithful, I dislike babies, housework, I can't cook, I smoke like a chimney, loathe getting tarted up and I fart in bed. And on the plus side? There isn't one, not for you. I'll get bored. And when something better comes along, I'll dump you. Is this a regular turn-off, or am I privileged? - It's regular. I like to be fair. - What's the drop-out rate at this stage? Low. Most plunge in, thinking they can change me. Getting cold feet? Come on, let's eat. My judgment's better on a full stomach! I'll decide then whether I should sow my seed on sterile ground. - Screw you, McLoughlin. - Getting cold feet, Cattrell? That's me when I was a nubile 17-year-old. Had a thing with a sculptor during the school holidays. - Nice. - My body or the sculpture? I came over the wall to avoid the press. The car's parked in the lane. For God's sake, what's the matter with you? Nothing. Nothing to do with you. Nothing? You've given up, woman. You've buried yourself alive in this bloody mausoleum. She's not worth it. What's she done for you that's worth sacrificing your life for? Where's the Anne Cattrell that seduced sculptors and toppled governments? It was fun while it lasted, McLoughlin, but I told you, don't try to change me! Look... Anne! Anne! Help, somebody! No, wait! There's a very faint pulse. Get my bag, Mum, in the hall. It's weak, but it's there. Hey, McLoughlin. - Can you give her something? - I'm not qualified. - It may be a fracture. - Diana's phoning an ambulance. Jane's gone to tell Fred to open the gates. Will she be OK? - I don't know. - Your daughter's outside? - The lodge isn't on the phone. - Jesus! Phone the police! I can't tackle a maniac on my own! Jane! Stop! Wait! Jane! Stop! I'm a police officer. Just stay there. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Nothing, I... I just thought I should come with you. Could you shine that torch on the ground? You're blinding me. Sorry. Shall we go on? Please, don't be frightened. Your mother knows me. She said to come after you. - I could hear breathing. - That was just me, my lungs gasping. No, it wasn't you. I thought it was my father. Hey, come on. - What did she mean, Mrs Maybury? - She was frightened. She wasn't frightened. She was terrified, and not of me. She said, "I thought it was my father." - What did she mean? - Nothing. You probably misheard her. Boss wants a word. - I don't like the smell of this, Sergeant. - I was trying to get ahead of the game... She's a murder suspect. If something's been going on between you, I'll have you charged. Do me a favour, sir. She's treated me like Jack the Ripper since I called her a dyke. You've been warned. There's a pattern to this and I want it found. - This is an inside job. - Don't get hung up on a pattern. Mrs Phillips calls this a fortress. Why? You've been conned by professional liars, lad. Sharpen up, or you'll look bloody foolish! I realise you're upset. She's your best friend. I only want to help. That's all I ever wanted to do. You had a row. She threatened to talk to us about the ice house murder. You were scared. You hit her. You never intended to hit her that hard. I've told you what I think happened. - Some person or persons entered the house? - Yes. Like you now claim they did nine years ago. Why didn't you tell us then if these "vandals" did all the damage you claim they did? You wouldn't have believed me. You'd have accused me of doing it myself. Not if you were telling us the truth. Nothing would have induced me to have you back in this house, once I'd got rid of you. You really think I'm that gullible? No. I think you're narrow-minded and vindictive. Why? Because I don't share your taste in melodrama? I'm a realist. I prefer to deal in facts, not female neurosis. I never realised how much you dislike women! Or is it just me? Would I have saved myself all this misery if I'd just said yes, ten years ago? That'll be all, Mrs Maybury. When we first got here, it was totally vandalised. They'd used the house like a public convenience. Even after all the bleach, the place stank. - Did Mrs Maybury know who'd done it? - No. Some drunken louts from the village. She lived on her own then. She took the children and hid in the cellar. Brutes! If I'd got my hands on them, they'd have soon sobered up! I need an identification of the corpse in the ice house. - The investigation's a farce without one! - I said I'll ring. If it's about those maps of the Grange, we can't find them. - Oh. - I can probably dig one out for you. - Left over from when Casey ran the garage. - Casey seems to have vanished. - Have you heard from him? - I heard he had a breakdown. - He wouldn't get involved with Streech. - How do you mean? Mrs Maybury ruined his life. The bitch murders her parents and he gets blamed! You've heard of the assault on Miss Cattrell? Shocking. No matter what you think of them, that's not the solution. Did anyone see or hear anything that might help? It's got to be one of her lezzie friends. No bugger else would go near the place! See you later! "No bugger else would go near the place." Now, that's not strictly true, is it, Eddie? - What are you on about? - You take girls into the Grange woods. - Bollocks! - Up there last night? No. - Perhaps I'll ask your girlfriend Tracy. - We weren't up there. - So you were there on your own? - No! Come on, Eddie. Who were you there with? One of your bits on the side? For Christ's sake! I never went near the bloody dyke! I was watching telly, alone. - I can tell you about some other stuff. - What? My boss says you want to know about a woman he heard crying at the Grange grounds? - What night it was? I was there. - Go on. I want a complete guarantee no one will find out where you got it from. No court appearances. If they issue a writ, you have to turn up. Forget it. The bird I was seeing has a big husband. Oi! Write down everything you saw. Send it to me at this address, unsigned. I'll treat it as an anonymous tip-off. - That way, nobody will know where it came from. - Right. And, Eddie, if you don't, I will personally tattoo "Eddie Staines is a shag bandit" across your forehead and parade you round the village. You were never this quiet. Even at school you talked in your sleep! Oh, Anne... It's all falling apart. I don't think I can hold on. Everything's out of control. - How is she? - I don't know. She's very restless. Jane wants to come and see her. - Is she up to it? - Well, she ate her breakfast! - It's about time she grew up. - She still needs looking after. Too late for that. Mollycoddling her now won't help. It's clear from your letters you were furious with Thompson. Of course I was. He'd squandered £20,000 of mine! - Know anything about his disappearance? - No. You knew he'd disappeared before we told you. He was supposed to come and explain. He didn't. I rang his wife and got abuse. A few days later, I went to his office and he'd disappeared. Anyone who invests in see-through radiators should expect to lose money! - Don't be so bloody patronising! - I understand. Your pride has been hurt. I can imagine you killing someone who made a fool of you. I think Mr Thompson came here. You got angry with him, as you are with me, and you hit him. He's built like a tank! Were you sleeping with him? I'll make a confession. I found Daniel even less fanciable than I find you. His wife denied any connection between him and the Grange. Doesn't surprise me. I met her once and she didn't approve of me. I wonder why Did Molly and Fred know about this investment? - No one knew. - Perhaps they did your dirty work for you. - You're a nasty man! - Are they your avenging arm? - No! - Are they, Mrs Goode? No! Ask me again and I'll hit you! You and me starting off... You didn't exactly meet me at my best. It wasn't personal. It wasn't the lesbian business. You were a woman. As it happens, a particularly infuriating, rude, smart-arsed woman. Anyway, I'm sorry. Time to go. I'll see if I can get you alone later. You can't leave now, you mean sod. I'm dying. - Have you been awake all this time? - No, I don't think so. - Am I at home? - Hospital. Oh, shit. I hate hospitals. - I'll find a nurse. - No. I hate nurses! - What happened? - Somebody hit you on the head. Who? We don't know. What can you remember? Curry? Can we forget the curry? It would be easier if you never saw me last night. - But what happened? - I found you inside your room. I had a hell of a job explaining to Walsh what I was doing there. I could hardly admit to lusting after a suspect. - I want to stay on the case, Anne. - I remember now. You were telling me how to live my life. You had no right, McLoughlin. If I can live with myself, that's all that matters. I'm learning. Give me time. What else can you remember? You've no business to be asking her questions! Nurse! Get me Dr Renfrew. Out! Don't go! I've seen her picture on "World at War" and she wasn't fighting for the Allies! Williams has had a result on the shoes. He's found the cobbler. - And? - Thompson's. He collected them a week before he went missing. Not looking good for Mrs Goode. You said these weren't your husband's, Mrs Thompson. - Sorry. Of course they're Daniel's. - Why did you tell us they weren't? I wasn't feeling well the last time you were here. Are these the shoes he was wearing the day he disappeared? No. You told us he only had one pair of brown shoes and he was wearing them. Those are the shoes Daniel gave to the tramp! What tramp? We didn't ask his name. He came to the door begging. - When was this? - The day before Daniel disappeared. - The 24th of August. - Can you describe this tramp? He was wearing check trousers, a brown hat, he was about 60. He smelt terrible. Why are you asking me? You must have spoken to him. How did you get the shoes? You said your husband had no connection with the women at the Grange. - One, Mrs Goode, invested in his company. - No! - Mrs Goode claims she met you. - An attractive woman. Dark hair. Daniel introduced me to a Mrs Goode in the street. - I didn't know she was one of them. - Why would he be secretive? - He must have told you. - No. He said she was a client. Is that all she was? What do you mean? Of course! You don't believe that, do you? If Thompson was wearing the shoes, why did the killer leave them in the grounds? - Why were they there if the tramp had them? - I feel Mrs Thompson's telling the truth. The description of the tramp matches the one Williams came up with. - Was she checked out properly? - Perfect alibi. Saw him onto the London train and went straight to a 24-hour fast at church. Yeah, but her alibi's only good for the 25th. Say you'd been married to a man for 30-odd years and suddenly he deserts you. - Go on. - Daniel does a runner. He hangs about in London but finds living there harder than coming home. Mrs Goode phones Mrs Thompson who discovers that her husband was seeing another woman, one with a reputation, and she's near the edge. What does she do when Daniel comes home unexpectedly? - How did she get him into the ice house? - Lured him there. We know of someone crying near Grange Farm. It's entirely logical to strip him and chop him about, so we'd think it was David Maybury. Early 60s, wearing check trousers. Just ring round the hostels. It's a good description. Someone might remember him. Yeah, I know. We're all busy. - No spade? - Sorry? - So I can dig my way out. - I brought you this. The flyleaf says it. "Incisive, acerbic and brutal." Just up your street, I thought. Bring any fags? - I'm not sure you can smoke in here. - God, you're so reactionary! - Have you always defied authority? - Oh, always. - Even as a child? - Absolutely. - What did your parents think? - My mother hated it. It was her life's work to keep my father happy. He was very demanding. How? The house revolved around his preoccupations. Defying him was the only way I could get his attention. Now you persecute the rest of us for the sins of the father. You knee us in the balls and send us on our way before we've had a chance to discover that you're the boring girl your father believed you to be. You're not one of those men that reads women's magazines? Any ex-lovers nursing sore balls that would like to hit you on the head? No. But you're giving me a headache. And we haven't even got on to the lover stage. Do you miss your wife? I miss what I kept hoping the marriage would be. - What was that? - A partnership. A challenge. An adventure. Why are you so angry she left? Maybe I've always been this angry. I just didn't know it till now. Sarge! - What do you reckon? - You've just found our assault weapon. - That's a Paddy Clarke special. - What's a Paddy Clarke special? There's no harm in it. It's a hobby. He brews them in his garage. Tastes like nectar. He sets great store by them bottles. I've never seen him let one out the pub. Is he the type to beat up women? Hit Miss Cattrell? No, he'd never do that. Him and her are "friends", you might say. Take that down to forensics. See if they can match the blood with Anne Cattrell's. McLoughlin. Yeah, hang on. Go ahead. Wally Ferris... Portside hostel. Cheers. Owe you one. Wally? Sorry, pal. Don't think you're the person I'm looking for. - Suits me. - Hang on. - Make your mind up. - What were you wearing when you got here? - Nowt to do wi' you. - I'll ask the warden. A jacket, brown hat and check trews. And I didn't nick them. I never thought you had. We're looking for a guy who's disappeared. I thought you might help me. I know nowt about nowt. Let's sit down. Do you remember going to the pub in Streech? About the last week in August. Aye. It was pissing down. What did you do when you left there? - I went to this shelter I know. - What shelter? No bugger else uses it. It's covered in brambles. Was it like a hollowed-out hill in the Grange grounds, like a cave? - If somebody's been complaining... - No, don't worry. - Do you remember what day it was? - Haven't a clue, man. You didn't see anybody else in the grounds? - No. - When did you leave? Next day. I went to East Deller. Knocked on a few doors. Then the bleedin' heavens opened - lightning, thunder, the bollocks. - What happened then? - There was this house on its own. I went round the back, exploring for shelter. I wasn't after nowt. - I saw this shed and popped inside. - And? I found this fella hiding behind some boxes. He ordered me off his premises. I reckoned if he was the owner, how come he was hiding? There was a woman come from the house. She said it was her husband. And he was in the shed looking for a paintbrush. What then? I got a bottle of whisky, 20 quid and a decent pair of shoes off them. They were dead keen to get shot of us. - And the shoes? - Dumped them in the woods. They pinched like buggery, man! I have a warrant to search this house, Mrs Thompson. I've got a cab coming to take me to the station. I'm going to the seaside. We've found the tramp you talked of. - So? - You didn't only give him some shoes. - You gave him £20 and a bottle of whisky. - Daniel was very generous. Wally says you were keen to get rid of him. That's why you were so generous. He also said he found your husband hiding outside. It was the other way round. Daniel found the tramp. He was looking for a paintbrush. Wally was here on the 27th of August, not the 24th as you claimed. - No, he can't have been. - Know where we found Daniel's shoes? - At Streech Grange, near the ice house. - So? You must have known we found a corpse in the ice house. Male, five foot ten, between 50 and 60. He was murdered at the same time your husband went missing. - No, I didn't know. - It was in the papers and on the news. I don't watch the news. It's too depressing. I'd no idea. No idea we'd found a body or no idea there was a body to find? You're confusing me! Your husband was alive two days after you reported him missing. And two days after you provided yourself with an alibi. He hasn't been seen since. A week ago, a body was found corresponding to the description of your husband less than four miles up the road. We can make a case against you for the murder of your husband. Is that clear enough? - It can't be Daniel's body. - Why not? Why not? He sent me a letter two weeks ago. - Could we please see this letter? - No, you can't. I burnt it. We've done the rest of the house and garden, sir. May I have the keys to your suitcase, Mrs Thompson? - I'm not having you go through my case. - Brownlow. The keys, Mrs Thompson. - Nothing, sir. - Your handbag, Mrs Thompson. I don't... Seems OK. Would you rather be outside while we search this room? No, I would not. Why were you so shocked about the body in the ice house? If your husband's alive, what have you to worry about? - He's threatening me. Tell him to stop. - Back off, Andy. With pleasure, sir. The chair, sir. She's hiding something! - You bastard! You bastard! - Got it! What about the bloody handcuffs? Serves you bloody right! I hope you catch something! I have - you. Two tickets for the flight to Malaga this evening. "Mr and Mrs Thompson." Get to the airport, Williams. Pick him up. Can't you two go any faster? Until you're recovered, we give the orders. If you can't stand that, we'll leave you in the care of Sister Ryan. I'll be so quiet, you'll think I'm dead. You don't have to go back, either of you. Don't be bloody ridiculous. Look, it's dangerous. Whoever attacked you is still out there. We're going back. Hm? We'll do what we've always done. Protect ourselves. - Get your supper, Wally? - Aye, ta. - About three helpings! - Never look a gift horse an' all that! Can you see the man who gave you the shoes? Aye. That's the bloke there. Number six! Are you gonna fry him, or what? I don't want to cause Jane any distress, but we're running out of possibilities. I don't want you questioning her. She couldn't cope. It was dark. She was wearing a nightdress. She said, "I thought it was my father." What did she mean? I'll go upstairs and wake her, if I have to. I think you already know what she meant. I was the evening receptionist at the surgery. One night I had the 'flu. I came home early. His violence had always been directed at me. In a way, I asked for it. While he was beating me, I knew he wasn't touching the children. So I thought. God, I was naive. He'd been raping Jane since she was seven years old and he kept her quiet by telling her that he'd kill me if she ever said anything. Did you kill him? No. I would have, but a child's bedroom doesn't lend itself to murder weapons. And what happened? We never saw him again. Why didn't you tell the police the truth about him? My only witness was a severely disturbed child. I wouldn't let her be questioned. Nor would I give the police a motive for a murder I didn't commit. She was under a psychiatrist for years. When she became anorexic, we thought she was going to die. - Have you any idea what happened to him? - I've always hoped that he killed himself. But I doubt he had the guts. If you'd prefer to have your mother with you... No, thanks. I'll be fine. - What do you think happened to your father? - I'm not sure. The night he disappeared - did he do anything different? Did he, Jane? - Sort of. - What? He told me he loved me. Why was that different? I'm sorry. I need to know. He'd never said it before. Did he do anything else unusual? - He gave me a present wrapped in tissue. - What was it? A teddy bear. I used to collect them. When he'd finished, he stroked my hair and said he was sorry. Then Mum came in. What happened then? They just stared at each other. Then he got off the bed and pulled up his trousers. I do remember Mum's face. It was frozen. She only moved when he'd left the room. Then she lay down on the bed beside me and hugged me. We stayed like that all night. And in the morning he'd gone. We never saw him again. Why do you think he bought you the teddy bear? Could it have been his way of saying goodbye? How do you mean? Perhaps that's how he disappeared without trace. He'd arranged the whole thing beforehand. - You mean he was going anyway? - Yes. It wasn't my fault he left? Surely no one suggested it was? Don't you see? When I was eight, my mother caught me in bed with my father. My father ran away and my mother was branded a murderess. You weren't to blame. I don't know. Maybe not. Right. You were running towards the lodge. I slowed down because I got a stitch. Then I thought I heard someone breathing. It seemed really close. I started to run. Then I heard footsteps. Yours. When you said you thought it was your father, that was because you were frightened? There wasn't anything in the breathing that reminded you of him? It's so long ago and Mum's burned all his photos. I wouldn't recognise him, never mind his breathing. - Was I OK? - You were great. - Is everything all right? - Fine. I'll go and help Molly with lunch. You see, the question I keep asking myself, over and over... ...perhaps unconsciously I knew what was going on. Perhaps I just didn't want to face it. She was my daughter. I... - I must have known. - How could you? Jane loved you. She wanted to protect you. If you blame yourself, you take away everything she tried to do for you. I'm her mother. There was only me to help her. When she needed me, I just never came. OK? What have I proved? Thompson's alive and well. And it's probable Maybury walked out of here ten years ago. Thompson faked bankruptcy and embezzlement. This is a murder inquiry. We still don't know who the body in the ice house is. And there's a maniac on the loose. What a burden living up to this image you portray, never allowing yourself to fail. - Bullshit! - You don't have to impress ME, McLoughlin. Life is pure farce, from start to finish! In a couple of weeks, you'll be as cynical as I am! - You're not all cynic. - What makes you say that? I've read your diary. Did you enjoy it? Needs editing to make it readable. - You would know, I suppose. - I can read. I can hold a paintbrush. That doesn't make me an expert on art. "P" needs editing out. "P" ruins it. - Tell me about him. - What do you want to know? - Would he attack you? - No! Perhaps he's jealous. It was one of his bottles that hit you. - I'm positive. Have you spoken to him? - Not yet. I'm waiting for the forensic results. If you can't bring yourself to ask, what do you expect me to say? You'll be gone soon, suddenly awoken out of your temporary madness and I'll be left here. He's a kind man and he understands everything. - Did you assault Anne Cattrell? - For Christ's sake, Anne's a friend of mine! She'll tell you I wouldn't hurt her. Perhaps you thought it was Mrs Goode or Mrs Maybury. Don't be an eejit. We go back a long way. They're my friends. - Do you sleep with all three of them? - Sleep with them? It's bloody lonely up there. They enjoy a bit of company. The conversation's more interesting than round here. - Will you have a bottle of special? - Yeah. I might even give you a list of my special customers. "About what we talked about, that crying woman. "It was Sunday, August 14th. "Me and the bird did it in Grange woods. "We left after 12. "Heard this wailing. "The bird legged it, but I took a look. You got it wrong. "It weren't a woman, it was a man, "rocking and banging his head. "I shone the torch on him, asked if he was OK. "He told me to F-off. "Seeing the description of the dead fellow, sounds right to me. "Thing is, I thought I knew his face. "Only came to me the other day. "I reckon it was David Maybury." - Where's Walsh? I need troops. - Someone's identified the body. - And? - David Maybury. Inspector's wetting himself. He and Robinson are off interviewing the informant. Was it David Maybury? Was it Maybury? I don't know. The body was unrecognisable. But I shouldn't think so. David's not likely to come back here after ten years. Someone's ID'd it. They say it's Maybury. Help me! - I can't! - Or won't? I believed in you! Don't you understand, you bitch, I put my head on the line for you? - You owe me! - Oh, well, hey! Never let it be said Cattrell doesn't pay her debts. Go ahead, screw me. That's all you were ever interested in. Just like your precious boss ten years ago. You didn't know? That horny bastard made Phoebe a proposition. A nice clean line drawn under the investigation in return for a weekly screw. He dressed it up a bit. She was alone and vulnerable, he wanted to protect her. She deserved something better after her husband's brutal treatment. She turned him down, told him where to stick his protection. She never thought that man held her future in his hands. I don't believe this. What makes you think you've got the monopoly on wanting to ball suspects? What do you mean, "He held her future in his hands"? Who do you think told the world Phoebe killed her parents then her husband? - Who briefed the press? - Why didn't she put in a complaint? - Oh, God. - Don't tell me. Who'd believe her against the Detective Inspector? It was Walsh's first big case as Inspector. He couldn't produce the goods because David had never been murdered so eventually the investigation stopped. That's when the fun started. There wasn't a soul in this bloody place who'd give her the time of day. She was verging on a breakdown when I moved in. Jonny had started wetting his bed, Jane was... Now that bastard wants to throw her to the wolves again. It isn't Maybury. How do you know? I've done a lot of work on these X-rays. We're looking at a 65 to 70-year-old. - Maybury would have been 54. - Correct. We can also rule out mutilation. I'm certain the damage to the body was done by animals. - Anything else? - I'm in two minds on how he died. It depends whether he was wearing clothes at the time. Have you sorted that out? No. There's a negligible amount of blood on the ground. If he was nude and he was stabbed, the ground would be saturated. If he was fully clothed, the clothes would soak up the blood. You're saying if he was nude, he couldn't have been stabbed? - Yes. - Supposing he was nude? How did he die? Old age? Cold? Shit. We've carried on a murder inquiry on the basis he was stabbed in the belly and you tell me he could have died of natural causes? Does Chief Inspector Walsh know about this? I've always kept an open mind about cause of death. The description of that tramp you were after. He's on the missing persons' list. How come Wally Ferris is down as missing? He's been on the road for years. Take a look for yourself. The description fits to a "T". - Did Walsh see this? - I left it with him on the first night. - You could have left him his underpants! - Are you charging me? - You tell me. - I didn't do any harm. I was wringing wet with all that rain, and him sitting there quiet as a mouse. I didn't click on he was dead, not for a while. I had quite a chat with him! His clothes were just folded up on the floor beside him. He didn't need them. - What do you reckon he died of? - Cold, probably. It was freezing with the door shut. It can't have been of owt nasty. He had a smile on his face. - What do you think he was doing there? - Probably looking for shelter, like me. He had a map of the big house in his pocket. I binned it. The thing was in shreds. - Did you close the door when you left? - I did the first time. Second time, I thought every bloke deserves a burial, so I nipped back and opened it. I reckoned it would be easier to find him with the door open. Bloody negligent! You missed it! The lad recognised Maybury. Wally must have seen him there. What can you do? Show Wally a photo of Maybury? Suggest it was the dead man? Staines has identified him. Eddie Staines is 25. He was 15 when Maybury disappeared. It was dark when he said he saw him. You'll never get a prosecution! We've motive, means and opportunity. She'll confess this time! - Webster won't lie for you. - What do you mean by that? The dead man was too old to be Maybury. And where was the blood? Get out! Will you tell the defence barrister to bugger off when he asks questions? The missing persons' list - Rogers showed it to you the night before he was discovered. Ken Chapel, 68, semi-senile. Walks out of his hostel five months earlier wearing green jacket and check trousers. The trousers should have registered with you! You heard the description twice! And you accuse me of negligence! How could this old man know about the ice house? He'd seen the plans. The tourist maps of the Grange grounds. Ken Chapel. Initials, K.C. The old boy used to talk in the hostel about a garage he once owned and how successful it was until this woman spread lies about him and he had to sell up. - Ring any bells? - The garage owner here was Ken Casey. How could I connect them? He's filed as Casey. You're damn right it's in the file! For a bit of hearsay, you certainly gave it some airing. It's a great story. Shame about the facts. Is it my fault people thought that? We recorded what we heard. Like hell you did! You encouraged the rumour, even trotted it out for my benefit. What did she do, for pity's sake? Laugh? Threaten to tell your wife? Or couldn't she hide her revulsion? You think you're so bloody clever, don't you? I know all about you and Miss Cattrell. She's using you. Wake up and find out just what these women are capable of. But I'm telling you, Phoebe Maybury murdered her husband. You have to believe that, don't you? That's what's kept you going these last ten years. I'm warning you. I'll have you suspended. What for, you bastard? Telling the truth? - Hello, Andy. - Don't do those. I'll do it at the weekend. I'll make a call, grab a shower and I'm out of here. Take what you want, except my books. Jack and me, it didn't work out. It was a mistake, Andy. I'm sorry! I want to come home! Look... Come home. - It's yours as much as it's mine. - You're not angry? No. No, I'm glad. - Hello? ""Rose and Crown"". - McLoughlin. - Hi, Andy. - We've identified the body. It'll be in the papers tomorrow so it has to be tonight. - I"ll see what I can do. - Say the women are getting away with murder. I'll be with you by ten. Bye. I'll pick up the books tomorrow and some of the records I bought before we were married. - Nothing else I want. - You are angry! No. I needed a push. I hate this place. Always have. Have you met someone else? What's the problem? Why are you looking at me like that? All I did was tuck them in as I normally do. You have to fabricate some strange thing that's going on. What's the problem? Diana! Di! Di, we've got visitors. - Have you called the police? - There's no point. It'll be over, one way or another, before the police get here. I can't see a bloody thing! They're out there. No, Phoebe, this is madness. Put the gun down. Somebody's gonna get killed! I just went in there as normal... Get down, Phoebe! Get off me, you bastard! Shut it! God, woman, what are you doing here? What have we ever done to you? I don't even know half of you! - Why don't you answer her? - The bitch murders her parents and husband. - And you shits let her get away with it! - Mrs Maybury didn't murder her parents! Her father took the car to the garage because the brakes felt soft. He wrote a note to that effect. Casey ignored it. That's why they died. Second, David Maybury walked out of this place alive ten years ago. - Nobody murdered him. - Who's arguing? Eddie saw him three months ago. Mind you, he's dead now! - Hell of a way to get your own back, lady! - The body wasn't David Maybury. - Oh, yeah? - It was Casey, who you bought the garage off. I... I only said I thought it was him. That inspector said it had to be him. Right, then, if she murdered Casey this time, she must have done her husband in ten years ago. Casey wasn't murdered! He died of cold, neglect, starvation! If you'd offered the poor sod some help, he wouldn't be dead now. - The inspector said he was stabbed! - The inspector is taking early retirement. If you're after queer-bashing, you're off the mark! Bullshit! Everyone knows they're bloody lezzies! - Look what they tried to make Tracy do! - She made that rubbish up. She was spotted leaving the woods. She was seeing another man. You bastard! It's a bloody lie, Eddie! Why are you here, Eileen? You're always preaching your Christian ethics. - Come on, woman. Give us the truth. - You've been screwing that whore! That bloody Cattrell woman. I've slept with lots of lovely women, but not Miss Cattrell. Where were you the night Anne Cattrell was attacked? - In bed asleep. - Is that right? - We sleep in separate rooms. - Was it your idea to come here tonight? - No, of course not. - Yes, it was. It was hers! She said there'd be free beer, that it was our duty. I got the idea from him! He told me what they did that night, nine years ago. - The woman's cracked. - Liar! You said only a man could do what you did that night. - The walls were dripping. - You bastard! The bitches deserved it. They were getting away with murder! They're not natural! I've watched them, parading around in the nude, displaying their filth! You've watched my mother? - What else have you done? - Jonathan! - Shut up! - Stop him! The pillock's mental! - Put the gun down! - Did you assault Anne? Try to kill her? Jon, he's not worth it! "Punishment's no good unless it comes from your own hands." Your words. Did you try to kill her? Answer me, you shit! The police let her go. I was only being a good citizen, finding out what she was up to. The silly bitch came back. Nine years ago, what were you trying to do then? Please, somebody! Help me! We got drunk, a load of us. We thought she'd murdered her husband. We did it for him! Me, Mum and Jane, locked in the cellar. We heard you laughing, smashing things. We thought you were gonna kill us. Can you imagine how frightened we were? You pissed all over my home, you bastard! I was 11 years old. Please... No! So what do I do about Jonathan Maybury? - Accidental discharge of a licensed weapon. - You won't get away with that! Surely you were too preoccupied with taking down the names of all the witnesses. How do I explain Barnes's confession? Shock of the gun going off suddenly brought him to his senses. OK? We'll have to keep Eileen in overnight. She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. We'd hold hands and there'd be this charge between us. That's what frightened her. A terrible thing, fear of love. It's all over, isn't it? The inspector was very curt on the phone, but he seems to have absolved us. Yes, you're absolved. I always hated what that man Casey did to you, Phoebe. But to die alone like that, with no one. Nothing. Could you come in to the station tomorrow, press charges against Daniel Thompson? Um... Oh, um, no, it's probably not worth it. I'd better just forget about it. Put it down to experience. - I'll come with you. - No. No, thanks. I'll go on my own. I will be there. I promise. Jonathan asked me to find out whether you wanted your love letters back. Are they love letters? I could get them out anyway, take a look. I could tell you there's a brick wall in the cellar which I'm going to examine closely. You'll probably despise the romantic in me, but I was hoping you'd tell me what he'd hidden because you trust me. Photographs. What of? The house, after the vandals had been. Phoebe half out of her mind. That another one of your insurance policies? He's leaving. Jonathan's packing. - He has to get back to the hospital. - For good! He says he's never coming back. Talk to him, please! Anyone would think HE'D raped me. What are you doing? You thought I was going to kill him. You really thought I was going to kill him! You think I'm some kind of monster. No. You won't see a Maybury in this house again. - No, you've got it all wrong. - It's all right for you. You're perfect. - Never done anything wrong in your life. - You don't know what I... What don't I know? Tell me! What? What? He came back, didn't he? My father came back. When? When? Recently? - No. - When, then? The night after the vandals had... Nine years ago? - I thought they'd come back to kill us. - What happened? - What did he say? - It was all so quick. What was? Please, just tell me. I was in the kitchen. I heard somebody stumbling about in the dark. I saw the axe. Then he came through the door. Did you see his face? Did you know it was him? - No. - Mother, please! Did you know it was my father? What's this? What is this? Phoebe! Yes! I knew! It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It was an accident. She never intended to kill him. Well, you... You could have called the police in then. With all the evidence of what happened the night before, she could have pleaded self-defence. I didn't know for a fortnight. Phoebe locked herself and the children into a bedroom. Jon took the key while she was sleeping and rang me. He was only 11. He said he was doing his best but thought that Mummy and Jane needed a proper person to look after them. I'm sorry. What did you do when you got here? Phoebe was completely off her head. All I could think of was putting the children first and keeping their mother out of a prison hospital. I bricked the revolting mess up behind a wall in the cellar. Diana checked when Fred found that thing in the ice house. We were so afraid he'd got out somehow. Does Phoebe know what she did? It took a while, but yes. Means we'll never be able to sell the Grange. Some sod's bound to want to rip out the cellar and put in a jacuzzi! At times it's been almost unbearable but when I look at the three of them, it was worth it. What can I say? Except next time I tell you how to run your life, remind me, you know best! My wife came back today. Oh. Are you glad? Yes. Yes, I'm glad. Well, then, I'm glad for you. What will you do? Oh, the usual. Topple a few governments, seduce a sculptor or two! Before that, will you help me in the cellar? I think it's time David Maybury left this place for good. What? If Phoebe isn't freed of him, you and Diana will be tied to this house forever. Well, I'd better make tracks for my bed. I wish you luck, McLoughlin, I really do. I don't suppose you could lend me a toothbrush and a pillow? - What for? - I've nowhere to sleep, woman! I told you, my wife came back today and I'm damned if I'm spending another seven years with a woman whose favourite colour is beige! What are you going to do? I thought I'd shack up with a friend of mine. - Anyone I know? - No, no. Just some cynical female who's absolutely useless at relationships. Sounds like my kind of woman! Yes.
