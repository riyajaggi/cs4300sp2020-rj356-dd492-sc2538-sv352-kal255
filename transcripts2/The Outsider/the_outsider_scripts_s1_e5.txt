 And ? Apparently, her story is pretty much the same as Hofstadter and Maitland's. So, she's uncovered a national ring of falsely accused child murderers ? - Anything else ? - No. I've just told you the sum total of what she told me. - Where is she now ? - Headed back to Dayton. Headed back to Dayton. Why ? You know the drill, Howie. You start out in city A. That leads you to city B. What you learn there takes you back to A, but with educated eyes. I think she knows more than she's saying. Yeah. Maybe she's waiting for everything to gel. You're the one who said to have faith in her, Howard. So why don't we just do that, see where she takes us next. Yeah ? Yeah. Okay. Fine. - So, how was your week ? - It was okay. Yeah ? Listen, honey, you're doing everything you're supposed to. Working on your GED, going to all your meetings. Dropping clean urines... You keep that up, you stay clean, in two months, we go back to court, I'm guessing judge is gonna downgrade your charge to a misdemeanor, time served. Did you go to your parenting workshop this week ? Not this week, 'cause the baby had got sick. Did you notify your instructor ? I texted her, but she didn't get back to me to say she got it. Well, I'll look into that. Eric Stander ? Sorry... Excuse me, right this way. Any word yet on that grey gunk they found in the barn ? Not as of yet, but hopefully soon. Excuse me... I just want to remind everyone that if you're gonna wear a hoodie in here, it needs to be back down off your face. Thank you. Sir, in the green. Sir. Sir. Tough day ? More like weird. Weird how ? There was a guy... Just weird. Do you mind if we order takeout tonight ? The thought of cooking now... I'm gonna go lie down for a bit. Just call me when the food is here, okay ? Food's here. Get up, babe. Baby, get up. - Come on, Jeannie, get up. - Please... - Jeannie, come on. - Please leave me alone. - Sweetheart. - Leave me alone, Ralph. Please. - Start pulling yourself together. - Ralph... I don't want this. No. Pull myself together ? - My God, pull myself together ? - Yeah, Jeannie... You gotta pull yourself together, okay ? - You have got to get on with your life. - Like you ? - At least I'm trying. - You're trying ? - Yeah, I'm trying. - My God, Ralph. It's two in the afternoon. You're shitfaced. Trying ? My God, please go. Jeannie, he's gone. He's not coming... - I know he's gone ! - Okay. He's gone. He was mine. - Yeah... And he's gone. - I was here. You're gone. It's me and him. You weren't here. - What ? - You weren't here. Please go. Please... Please go. - Who was the boogeyman ? - Sorry ? When you were little, who was the boogeyman ? Baboulas. My old Greek granny used to say if I didn't behave he'd come and take me away. - Grief-eater. - What ? I say grief-eater, you say... - First thing that comes to mind. - Ulcer. - Too literal. - Stress giver. - More poetic. - Skye ? Hold on. - Tear-drinker. - Better. Where we going with this ? You're the tear-drinker, your words, and you're thirsty. Where would you go ? - Poetic or literal ? - Literal. - How thirsty am I ? - Very. You're not in a rush to leave. How about a funeral home ? That's got to be like a non-stop Niagara Falls. Too impersonal. It likes to be the cause of the tears. The grief. According to my parents, that would be anytime I come home for a holiday. It likes to linger. Likes to savor. It's an "it" now ? What about a haunted house ? Does it believe in ghosts ? Maybe if it made the ghosts ghosts to begin with, then... Or a cemetery. Its victims are already there. The family comes to mourn over and over. Hey, there you go. And it wouldn't be disturbed. - Can I just ask... What do you do ? - I'm a private investigator. - Investigating paranormal activity ? - Not at all. So... All this we're talking about, we're just goofing around, right ? - Do you know the city well ? - Does Tarzan know the jungle ? I can give you 200 dollars to drive me around tomorrow. Ralph ? Ralph ? Sit. Tell him to stop. Stop ? Or he'll die. I don't understand. You'll both die. Jeannie... Hey, Jeannie. Jesus. You stepped on some glass in the dining room. - I did ? - You don't remember ? You know what ? I'm gonna go get some stuff for this. Okay ? Tell me what happened. I got a glass of water, I guess... I dropped it. So... You just cut your foot and came back to bed. Guess I was half asleep. Ralph... I think you should drop the investigation. Why's that ? Because if you don't, I feel like something very bad is gonna happen. Something bad is already happened. I'm just trying to get to the bottom of it. Someone was here last night. What do you mean... Someone was here, like, what ? In the house, he spoke to me. Somebody broke in ? He said that you have to stop looking into the Frankie Peterson investigation. Baby... - Right, you had a dream... - Or you'll die. - Nobody's gonna die. - We'll die. Nobody's gonna die. Look... Jessa Maitland gave you that exact same message. She chose you to give it to. That exact same message. So, what does that tell you ? Tells me that what a sad little girl said got under your skin. It tells me that Frankie Peterson's murder makes Derek raw for you all over again, just the same as it does for me. You stir all that together, what you end up with is a very bad dream. We sat right in there. It's... Last year after Derek... Do you remember, the doctors put you on the combination of antidepressants. And you used to sleepwalk, all the time. Remember that ? - Well, not all the time. - It was a lot. You don't remember. Well I'm not on those meds now. Fair enough, but you still sleepwalk. Sometimes you do, sometimes I think it's just 'cause you miss him. You get up, you... I figure you're kind of looking for him. You know ? Listen, I don't live inside your head. But... I swear to you... All that happened last night is you had a very scary, very vivid nightmare. This is what you do, isn't it ? Take the whole family. What ? It was here. What was ? It's all in the air, all it had to do was close its eyes and inhale. It likes to linger... All that grief down there, what a feast. Ralph Anderson. I just sent you some photos from outside of the cemetery where Williams sisters are buried, and others from outside of the cemetery where Heath Hofstadter was buried. Not much to look at. Have you been down to where Terry Maitland was buried ? - I didn't see any reason to do that. - Then can you do something for me ? Can you go out there and take some photos ? - Of the grave ? - That and whatever's close by. - Such as ? - Anything that looks derelict. Abandoned structures, homes, factories, dumping grounds... You need to tell me what this is about, Holly. I'd be embarrassed to say now. I might be wrong, but it could be important. See... I've been sticking up for you with Howard and the others since you left for New York, but I don't have a clue what you're doing right now. So, you need to give me something so I can take it to him, or he might just pull the plug. Humor me. Did you know him ? Well you did, I'm so sorry. I didn't know him, but a friend of mine did and he... When he heard I was passing through, he asked if I could come here and pay his respects for him. Can I ask who he was to you ? My friend said he was a good guy, but... I don't understand what happened to him. He fucked him over good. Fucked over Heath ? Who did ? He fucked me over, too. Who did ? Maybe I can... What's your name ? You sure you're gonna be okay in there by yourself ? Yeah. I'm just checking to see if I need a stitch. Okay. I'll be here. What ? The investigator we hired wants me to go to the cemetery to take photos of where Terry's buried. - Why ? - That's what I said. Are you gonna do it ? - I don't know... - You should tell Glory. Why would I upset her ? Because I think she'd be more upset if you didn't. I'll call her later. Here. Yune, it's Ralph. Listen, manager of the strip club, Claude Bolton. He's got a sheet, he's done some time, so we should have his prints. Do me a favor, will you ? Throw him up against the Peterson homicide. No, it's probably nothing. And can you send me a mugshot ? Thanks. So, Claude's prints didn't match anything from the scene. Yeah, I didn't think they would, but... You wanna tell me what that was all about ? Jeannie drew that's somebody she saw in the house the night before last. - Someone broke in ? She okay ? - No, she just had a bad dream. My grandfather and his two brothers were Marines in Korea. My great-grandmother used to worry herself sick over them. Then one night she has a dream. This woman comes to her in the dream with two pails of milk. My great-grandmother says, "There's supposed to be three." Okay. The next morning, there's a Marine at her door, telling her that one of her sons, my grand-uncle, Roberto, was killed in combat. My grandfather and his other brother made it through the war and came home. Dreams are messages, bro. Terry once told me that if he died first, he wanted to be here because all his people are here going back to the Civil War. - My God, look at this place. - Did you order the stone ? Yeah, it comes in a month or so, they said they'd put in a temporary one but where the hell is it ? Thanks again, Glory. Is that it ? No. Tell me again why you're here. Honestly, I don't know, but... Do you mind if I take some photos ? Of what ? What is he looking for ? Jesus Christ. - That's the barn. - What about it ? Where they found Maitland's clothes. - He's not good at this. - No. But we forgive him. - So, you guys came in from Taiwan ? - Yeah. Pardon me. Hey, what you drinking ? - Ginger ale. - And ? - Just ginger ale. - Taking a break. Yeah, I guess so. Hey, listen, you went out to that barn the other day, right ? Yeah, it was a real bullshit run. Time I got there, the Staties had been done and gone. Did you see anything you think the Staties might have missed ? - Like what ? - Like, I don't know, like you tell me. - I should tell you ? - Jack, I... You're not even on the job right now, Anderson. All of a sudden I have to give you a debriefing ? - Jack, I was just curious. - Yeah. I didn't mean to... Hello, little man. - You want to hold him ? - No. I think I'm coming down with something, I don't... - You don't want to hold my son ? - T, you don't want... I'll be right back. Hey, Jerome. Hello. Hey. Hey, look at me. What the hell is going on with you ? What is it the ginger ale ? Because I like you better when you're drinking. I like you better when I'm drinking too. You've been ten kinds of out of it these last few days. You can tell me anything, Jack, you know that. Just going through a patch. What is it, the divorce ? Your parents, your health ? - I'm fit as a goddamn fiddle. - Really ? 'Cause you just told me you were coming down with something. No. Then why wouldn't you hold my son ? 'Cause I don't want... - You don't want what ? - Anything to happen to him. What are you talking about ? I have to go. You don't tell me what's going on I will find out, you best believe that. - T, you need to back off. - Why ? For your own sake. I'm begging you. - Okay, so tell me what I'm looking at. - Looking for. For. Looking for. What am I looking for ? - Hiding places. - For who ? Could be a who, more likely a what. What ? Heath Hofstadter never laid a hand on those girls. And Terry Maitland didn't go near that boy. And you know this without ever having set foot in Cherokee City. - I do. - How do you know that ? Tell me that. Can I just say it didn't surprise me that the barn where Terry Maitland's clothes were found was so close to his grave. I just asked you a straight question and I want you to give me a straight answer. - It prefer to tell you in person. - Good. But not just me, you need to tell everybody involved. Which means you need to come down here. Howie will book a flight. No more flights, I'll drive. - Holly Gibney. - Holly ? Hey, it's Andy. Listen, I'm in the lounge downstairs, and I just stopped in for a drink. - I was wondering if... - If ? Well, if you felt like coming down for a bit. Why don't you come upstairs ? There's a minibar in my room. Okay. I snuck into Heath Hofstadter's house yesterday. - Yeah ? - It's deserted. A real mess. - I can imagine. - But Heath's bedroom... - Bed had no mattress on it. - Crime scenes probably took it. I'm sure, but the thing is, someone afterwards put clean sheets and a blanket on the box springs. Two years ago in Chicago, the daughters of an old woman hired me to investigate the strangulation murder of their mother after the police had closed the case. Her money was gone, her jewelry was gone, she lived in a crap neighborhood. The police just targeted local junkies. Which I knew wasn't right. Because ? Because she was found laying face up, with a pillow under her head and a washcloth over her eyes, which said to me that... That whoever killed her had a strong sense of remorse. They tried to make her comfortable afterwards, and the washcloth over the eyes... Tells me that he was afraid to see the disappointment in her eyes, that this was maybe someone she knew. - Possibly even someone who loved her. - Agreed. Why are we talking about this again ? Because this was a gesture of remorse. The bed maker was possibly involved in the killings of the sisters. Just didn't get caught. Go you. I'm so sorry, I have this big meeting coming up and I'm a bit nervous about it. I should never have... It's fine. Don't worry about it. - But I should go. - No. Could we maybe just lay down for a little ? Maybe just a little... Sometimes it feels like offending people has become a way of life for me. And... I'd like to apologize for getting up in your face yesterday when all you were doing was asking me the same damn questions about that barn I'd have asked you. Okay, well I appreciate that, Jack. But there's no need. The thing is I've been having some personal problems these last weeks. The drinking's been number one on the hit parade. Well, you know, cut back a little, I'm sure you'll find you'll regain that slender, girlish figure of yours. Yeah. Well... I'm sure it's too late for us to ever be friends. And for that I take all the blame. But, being the lazy bastard I am, I'd like to shoulder more of yours, and everyone else's workload than I have been. Can't say that I wouldn't enjoy seeing that. If you give me the chance to come on board... I'll show you what an asset I can be once I put my mind to a thing. Frankie Peterson, Terry Maitland, those cases are closed, so... We're just a bunch of concerned citizens more curious than most. All I'm asking for here is an opportunity. What can you tell me about the barn that night ? What the fuck ? What do you want ? Put down the gun. Come on, man, I'm begging you, you don't have to do this. Get down on the ground ! Put the gun on the ground right now and everyone gets to go home. - Tracy, give it up ! - Put down the gun ! Come on, man, please. You shoot me, they shoot you. - Don't shoot, please. - Show me your hands ! Damn. Guess what ? It's unloaded. Somebody should tell him, next time you commit suicide, just stay home and swallow pills. Danny, come take a look at this. Jesus Christ. What the hell did that ? Dad. Dad. Look at me. Look at me. You need to let me go. Dad... You need to let me go. THE OUTSIDER End of episode 5
