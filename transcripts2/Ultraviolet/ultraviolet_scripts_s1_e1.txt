 Hello, ma'am, clients are waiting. SHOW ROUTE All right then... Okay. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Cool car. Was this one the reddest they got? I don't know. You'd have to ask my mother. Serafina? "The Adventures of Serafina, The Little Mermaid". London! You lived there?

 So which is it? Serafin or Lozinska? What does it matter? It's my biggest dream, to get out of here right after I graduate. - And you come back. - I grew up here. And what's the real reason? - Can you turn it up a bit? - Sure. Thanks. RATE THE PASSENGER RATE THE DRIVER YOU HAVE 1 NEW RATING What? Lights, man! - Hello? - 112, what's your emergency? I... There was an accident...

 Under the overpass by the train station. A driver ran away. - Is anyone hurt? - I don't know. It's a woman. I understand, if it is safe, please approach the victim and check for a pulse on the wrist or on the neck artery. Are you there? Hello? She's dead... Okay, did you check the pulse, can you feel it? Hello? hel... To sum up, you're saying that you saw her on the overpass. No. I said I saw someone. That guy. At least I think it was a guy... He was standing on the overpass by his car and then he disappeared. Anything else? What kind of car was it? Big and black. You'd probably notice a year of production and mileage. But I did take a picture of the car that hit me. A nice shot. You can see everything, apart from the registration number. - So, you're saying you saw her jump... - I didn't see her jump. I saw her fall. The driver behind you claims she jumped. How? He just told me he didn't see anything. How fast were you driving? I don't know. I wasn't speeding. Someone was on the overpass. Why wouldn't they come down? Why wouldn't they help her? - Maybe someone pushed her? Killed her? - Did you have a lot to drink? Nothing yet but I won't be pacing myself after all this... Are you on any medications? Did you take anything? - You're joking, right? - Do I look like I am? I took one pill of... Ratenolu. - Ratenolu? - Yes, exactly. But that doesn't mean I didn't see what I saw! Fine. And on that positive note... Let's go. Someone was there, on the overpass! It's not just my imagination! - Calm down. Easy. - You believe me, don't you? Have a good day. STUDENT'S SUICIDE WOMAN JUMPED OFF THE OVERPASS. Before you left for London I told you to visit as often as you felt like it. I just didn't know you'll take my words so literally. On the other hand, it'll be easier to recuperate together. It hurts so much. You know, they told me I would be walking in a week... and running again after two. And now three months have passed and... Who would have thought that your fucked up life and my fucked up hip would bring us together again. Are you listening to me? No. I'm thinking about that girl. You shouldn't. Thinking has never been your strong suit. Well, thank you so much. Is that what you teach your students? - Leave it to the police. - Sure! To them! - Why does it matter what happened? - Why does it matter? Yes, why? You don't know that girl. But... But what do you think I should do? - Ola... - No, tell me what I should do! Should I pretend that I wasn't there? That I did not see it? Doesn't that remind you of something? No, of course it doesn't. It's so much better to pretend that nothing happened. Nothing has happened just like with Maciek. Nothing at all. Nothing. We're all cool. Maciek is dead and nothing can change that. And I got used to it and I think you should do the same. No, I'll go crazy. I'll just go crazy. She got used to it. You're sitting here covered with a blanket, - you don't leave your home. - Don't get excited. Her son took a few bullets in his head and she just got used to this situation! Don't get excited and don't scream! I'm going to scream because that's the truth! - No wonder the police say you're crazy! - I'm not crazy! I know what I saw! And don't even think about slamming the door! "What if the police don't care about you" "How to solve a murder without police involvement" Ultraviolet. Ultraviolet? And that means... An effective organization. Because violets can see much more than blues. And the blues means the police? There are more than 20 thousand unsolved murders in the country. We solved over a hundred. I, personally, over twenty. It's all on the website. Yes, I can see that. "We're effective! And there are many of us! Anyone who has that 'something' can join us!" Exactly, exactly... That's a good catchphrase. Together we form a huge brain. Each one of us brings something to the table, has some kind of specialty. You're like Spice Girls. Each represents a unique style. - Yes. - What's yours? I never give up. I was sixteen when I came across a body of a girl. Everyone said that she committed suicide. No one cared about her. No one even knew her name. They called her "The Lady of The Lake". I didn't believe the suicide theory, and I promised myself that I would eventually solve that case. That she'd get her real name back. - Is that you? - Unbelievably handsome, right? I look a bit different now but I'm still fighting to solve her case. And I met many people online who are just like me. And now we form Ultraviolet with these people. Tomek, hurry up... I'm ovulating. We're swamped with cases people send us. We don't take them all. Will you take the case of The Lady of the Overpass? The Lady of the Overpass PUBLISH Hi, there! Welcome to my channel! Great to have you here with me! Very often you ask me what you need around to always look fucking amazing. The answer is very simple. A simple tea spoon. Everyone has one in their kitchen. But how can we use it for make up? We can use it to apply mascara. Just hold it like this and apply your mascara. That will prevent the mascara from smudging and keep you from looking like a panda bear. I'll give you one more tip... - Such a great take ruined... - This is all bullshit. I think we've recorded and published that spoon tip six months ago. I do have one more tip... You can shove that spoon up your ass! Calm down. We have 25 percent more followers. It'll be new to them. - Where is this damn thing? - I've found it. A girl's body landed under the overpass. The police believe it was a suicide but the girl who posted it isn't so sure. She wants to know who the victim was. - Any pictures? - Yes, look. Wait! That t-shirt... There was a limited edition of those for a gym chain, remember? Nice patterns... I do. The quality was shitty though. Do you remember the name of that chain? Hello, Lady of The Overpass. See you tomorrow, Inspector. Hard to believe they made you an inspector. Nice to see you, too. What now? The usual. You sweep cases under the rug, I drag them out. Just like the old times. Did you identify The Lady of The Overpass? - What? - Thanks. Can you give me a moment? Her name's Monika Bielas, right? - How did you figure it out? - By tracing the t-shirt she was wearing. And I wasn't the one who figured that out. UV did. Those idiots from the internet? Please, don't do anything else. I googled her. But you won't lock me up for that, will you? - Whoever obtrudes or tries to prevent... - She grew up in Pabianice and studied for one year at the Łódź University of Technology. Her profile is private, but I've sent invitations to her friends. Mrs. Aleksandra, we don't want such help. If it's necessary, we request a court order and the profile is opened to us. - How long would that take? - About a month. So isn't it better to wait several hours until someone accepts my invitation? Do you believe me that I saw someone on that overpass that night? It would be easier... if you had been sober that night. Here! There were forty pills, now there are thirty two. Four years, eight pills. I'm not an addict! Serafin? You're married? More like separated. These belonged to my brother. He bought it when he visited me in London. It'll be exactly two years since he died on September 29th. I know that case. Kraszewski was the lead investigator in it. Murder in self-defense. Excuse me, but my break is almost over... and the Chinese bar is waiting. What are you talking about? What self-defense? He was standing a meter away from her and she shot him five times! Can you keep it quiet, please? And Kraszewski closed the case almost immediately. Kraszewski did his best. If I remember correctly, the files show that the life of your brother and his wife was not all that cheerful. Fine. It was quite tumultuous. But he never hit her. Never! She divorced him because she met someone else. And she killed my brother because she was broke. She wanted the insurance money. And Kraszewski did nothing about it... - He had no grounds. - Jesus! Listen to me. I'm not interested in your personal mess. He was your brother, I understand it. But Kraszewski acted like a professional. True. He was professionally cool when he notified my mother about her son's death and didn't even come in. He could at least say that he was sorry for her loss, it must be hard for her. Fucking anything! - Such conversations are not easy. - If you're supposed to help people, you should know how to talk to them. What is it called? A vocation? Vocation? - Your vegetables are ready. - I'm coming. - Do you believe in vocation? - Yes, I do. My parents think my vocation is to be a dentist like them. Thanks. - Did you find the car that hit me? - No. - Why? I gave you the photos. - Photos you can't see nothing on. The only thing you can see is that it is BMW series three from 2000. Do you know how many of those are in Łódź? - Lesne Runo just accepted me as a friend. - That's fantastic. Look! Monika Bielas. She published her last post five minutes past one a.m. Twenty minutes before the accident. Yeah... "God, forgive me. I can't... I don't want to live." She added nine cat emojis. So that's a suicide. A suicide and nine cat emojis? I looked through the victim's messages. She never used emojis. She hated them dearly. In July, she wrote if someone uses them talking to her, she'll delete them as a friend. - Hi, I'm Ola. And you are... - I'm Piast. Piast Kolodziej. I was thinking about her last message. I'm coming! Figure out those emojis. That doesn't make sense. Unless she wasn't the one writing that post. - Hey. - Hi there. Look! I was stupid enough to spend all my pocket money. - So, you do think I'm worth something. - No doubt about it, Henryk. Come in. I really do appreciate the fact that you came running to me after you got back from London. I had to take care of some things. I'm trying to get my life organized. I thought I'd see you at our place. I used to be there all the time. But I'm not one of those people who goes places uninvited. How's your mom after the surgery? She's waiting for someone to take her dancing. How about you? Come here. Let me give you a big hug. - Hi. - Hey. - What happened to the red arrow? - My mother would say I blew it up. You want to mess with the police again? You know what they told her parents? That she killed herself. - You want to help that policeman? - Give me a sip. You have to find the car she fell on. The dent in the hood of that car will speak volumes. Easy to say... you know how many of those cars there are in Łódź alone? Fucking dozens. The question is how many owners of such cars are afraid of the police enough to run from the scene, right? - No... - Relax! Relax! That BMW that hit me, that guy ran away from the scene. He did. Maybe his license was suspended. That's what I mean. Listen to me. If we can find that driver, that car, that dented hood. We'll find out how she really died. That suspended license narrows down the list of suspects. Yeah, right. But the case is already closed. Kraszewski's decision. Okay, let's do it like this. You'll give me the driver's address and I'll make sure you have no pangs of conscience... that you should be sitting now in a private surgery right now doing a root canal on someone's upper left molar. - I can't believe he gave you that number. - I know. - Maybe he wanted to get rid of me. - That's impossible. - There it is! The car. - Wait a moment. Let's go. The hood isn't dented. So that's it. It's not dented because it's been replaced. The color isn't right, see? Does it tell you anything? The first one not so much. But the second one speaks volumes. Take some photos and call that would be dentist. - Need some help? - What? Is there a problem? That's just an outdoor game, fellows. But wrong yard so we're leaving. So maybe take your boyfriend and go play somewhere else? - Okay. - Goodbye. - You're my fiancé. - What? Henryk Bak. I was a technical expert of the Polish Motor Association. Now I'm practicing unemployment. - Michał Holender. - Yes, I've worked with the police. I helped them on the truck versus bus accident in Walice in 1997. Were you on the job then? Want some beer? Wine? Vodka? Whiskey? Or maybe you'll grab a bite? - You had two minutes. - A small beer in that case. We're going to keep on joking? There are two corpses and a rape on my agenda. Get to the point. I'm listening. If she jumped, there would only be one dent in the hood. When someone jumps, or is pushed, it's an unconditional reflex that makes him assume a position to minimize the impact area. This hood, however... has two dents. What's the conclusion? When falling down, either she was unconscious or already dead. The minute's over. What do you think about it? The police won't be reopening this case. So, we have to recreate last few hours of her life. The end of June. Monika splits with her boyfriend, Piotr Walczak. Looks like she took that really hard. Doesn't look that bad, I think they became friends. Shoes off, please. Take off your shoes. Here's Monika's video from the Miss University of Technology Pageant. - She was one of the contestants? - Just observing, I think. - I'm taking part next year. - She's a nice chick. Give me a break. That boyfriend of hers... Was he there? On that night? Piast, did you check his account, did you manage to log in? Why wouldn't I? He wasn't there with her. He was visiting his mother in Skierniewice for the whole weekend. All his posts are from there. What did she do in the evening? Tomek? Can you finish now and turn it off? I'm looking through everything tagged #misstechnicaluniversity, # techincaluniversityoflodz... Wait, I think I found her. One heck of a party. Student style. You haven't seen a proper party. Fuck! I know that girl. - Henio, stay there. - Here? May I? Thanks. How long have you known her? I met her when she was thirteen. Her father died in a car crash. I was an expert on that case. Later I became a friend of the family... and in a way... I replaced her father. So, her father and brother are dead... - She has a talent to... - Is she married? Separated. And this separated one survived? The separated one? Survived. He was lucky. Excuse me! Remember me? I drove you here a few nights... The loser from London! I remember. Nice jacket. - Catch you later. - Where will you go? I'll text you. Can we have a word? There was a party after the Miss University pageant. Did you go there? A girl died that night. Monika Bielas. - You knew her? - A little. She was studying at a different department, sorry... Did you talk that night? I'm helping her ex-boyfriend. He's pretty bummed. He blames himself. She did say she broke up with her boyfriend and couldn't wait for the next chapter of her life. And when the "new chapter" appeared, they left. Do you know who he was? Right before she died, Monika Bielas picked up a guy at the party. Or maybe he picked her up, Wojtek Kraszewski. Kraszewski's son? That's why Kraszewski closed the investigation. It all makes sense to me. Wojtek killed her, but he called his daddy who cleaned it all up. Do we know where they went after leaving the party? We don't. But we're going to find out in a moment. - Wojtek's last post... - Wait a moment, Piast! - Go on. - Wojtek's last post... "Great party, we're going into the night". He was at Pilsudski park... on a clearing by the monument to be exact. Twenty minutes later Monika falls off the overpass. This means 20 minutes carrying her to the parking lot and drive to the overpass. According to the GPS, it's 25 minutes. If he stepped on it... Middle of the night, empty streets. - She came with him and he killed her. - Why? I don't know. Because he was drunk? We won't be able to prove that after all this time. Let's say he panicked, quickly published a new post, carried her body to the car, went to the overpass and... How long will it take to carry a body to the parking lot? You know, with the corpse. Well... Catch me! - Are you fast? - I don't know. - Ready? - Yes. - Start! Run! - Run, run! Why are you so slow? Come on! - This way or that way? - This way! What's wrong? - And? - You're too slow. Or you're too heavy. - And? - Eight minutes. - Are you having fun? - Stop it! No one can drive that distance in twelve minutes. He couldn't have killed her. I can. That's what I do for a living, remember? Since last month. With no good results. - And you're a terrible driver. - I know the shortcut. Wojtek was the last person to see her alive. I've looked through many pictures from that night. Monika is in many of them... and I was able to figure out what Monika did that night. Great. So we'll find out if she picked Wojtek up or the other way around. I arranged those pictures chronologically. We'll have something resembling a video which shows us exactly where and when she was. Piast, hold on for a moment. What about that guy? Who is that? Play it again. This guy's name is Pawel Porkut. There are a few pictures of Monika on his Fotogram page. And since there aren't pictures of any other girls there... we can safely assume he had a huge crush on her. And she chose someone else. That might make a guy angry. - Right, my darling? - Tomek, finish it... There is something else... When he wasn't publishing Monika's pictures, he published about ten photos of his car... Huge, black SUV? The internet has spoken. Has spoken. - Okay, see you. Take care... - But what do we do now? ...and be careful. And that was supposed to be a thank you? Whoever killed her, had to take her to that overpass. And the body must have left traces in the car... I'll check Porkut's car. Okay. I'll check how much time it really takes - from the park to the overpass. - Okay. Take care. All right, if I can get there in twelve minutes, you're toast. Fuck... You want to put my son in jail? We ended up in bed that night. She wanted that? Yes, but that doesn't matter anyway. Nobody will believe me. My father knows? My brother was as important to me as your son is to you. I closed the case of your brother because the investigation ended. It was a murder! His wife planned it and you believed her story. Courts would dismiss such rubbish. How could you just close the investigation? I'd do the same again. - When did you see her last? - She left when we were done. - And what did you do? - I went back to the park, to my friends. - At what time? - I don't know. My phone died. - Will your friends confirm that? - Why wouldn't they? You have an alibi. Waldemar will understand. - You have no idea how he can get... - How can he get? Can you imagine living at the precinct? - I live at the precinct. - No, you don't! I live at the precinct. With him. Every day! Everything according to clear rules and regulations. They don't include sleeping with a girl who jumps off the overpass right after. And all other things I did that night. Drugs? If he tells me to have blood tests, I'm gonna fucking kill you. What do you feel right now? As a parent? My child is not guilty. I will prove it. Here you are. - What is that? - Something I would never get from you. Proof that Wojtek couldn't have done it. Porkut! What the fuck are you doing in my car? - What did you do to her? - I can't breathe! Seriously? How about now? You were with her right before she died. Who was she with? Wojtek Kraszewski? She was alone. - We just talked. - You talked? You had a nice conversation in the middle of the night? About what? It was an accident. I grabbed her. She struggled and fell. She hit her head on the curb. But I didn't kill her. You didn't want it, you didn't kill her but you did take her body to the overpass... and threw her six meters down... straight on the hood of a passing car. My life is not worth living anyway. But hers was. Right on time! Here he is. - Are you okay? - Can't you see? Your other hand! How did Porkut get into her social networking profile? Kill me! Come on, kill me! - How? - Doesn't matter! Take my hand and put it to the phone screen. And what? That's how he unlocked the screen. After that he wrote a suicide note, added those idiotic emojis and threw her off the overpass. Excuse me. What happens next? The usual. The DA will take over. Porkut was arrested. He'll be arraigned in the morning. Monika's parents. At least they now know the truth. How are you? Better. - Mrs. Aleksandra? - Yes? Promise me, that this concludes... your career as a detective. I can't promise you that, Mr. Michał. I kind of like it now. If you are more efficient, then we can figure something out. Of course, you think you alone can do more than the entire police force. But I am not alone! Friends?
