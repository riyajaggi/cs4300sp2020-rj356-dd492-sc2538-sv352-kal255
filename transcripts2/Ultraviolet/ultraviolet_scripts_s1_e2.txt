 - Do it! Do it! Do it! - Do it! Do it! Do it! Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Did you search the shoreline? Any clothes? Yes, but not his. Also rags, newspapers, sticks... and rocks. Right, but he didn't come here naked. We have to search the woods carefully. Both sides. Okay, place him face up. That's that media guy. Andrzej Fromm.

 Okay, but you do realize whose body that was? The technology king. Pride of the internet. Very soon it's going to be one hell of a mess in the media. This is our priority now. Yes, sir. "Yes, sir" what? "Yes sir" doesn't cut it. We're searching the shoreline. We're about to check his house too. - We're doing everything we can. - That's not enough. Nobody's picking up. Fine, we'll jump the fence. Without a warrant? Move your ass. Hello? Ring.

 Ring what? The bell? Do you see a bell here? All right, call the pyro guys. What do we need them for? It's all electronics and sensors. So am I supposed to stand here and admire the sensors? Right, hold on one minute. - Love-car rental, how can I help? - Hi. Michał Holender. I need to hack, access this modern compound. I can't hear you. Can you say that again? I think I'm in shock. If you don't want to then... Wait, wait, wait. Okay. And what about that thing we talked about? - What thing? - My brother's case? - Listen, a man died. - Precisely. Fine, never mind. Wait, are you asking me for help? - No, I'm not. Well, technically... - Are you? Say it. You have an excellent opportunity to do some good. Forget about this conversation. Later. I hope I didn't offend you with my "Love-car rental" comment? No worries. But is this really a love-car rental? No, of course not. It was just a situational joke. Okay, well, we just thought... this color... Well, well. Who could this be? Fromm is dead? This information stays between us, okay? - Isn't this fake news? - No, no. This can't be happening. Fromm was a God. Piast is exaggerating. But his drones at the Expo, really were impressive... You know, the ones that played tennis. Drones are nothing. All his patents and software... And all the things, he's been designing and programming, what will become of them now? Totally unbelievable. Now, I told Michał it's gonna be a piece of cake, so if we can't handle it, it won't look good. - We'll get it done. - I'm a bit of a locksmith myself. Hold on, didn't I see someone in the corner of the screen? Who's that? - It's Henryk. - It's me, Henryk. Well, hello Henryk. So, how are your experts doing? On their way. You got anything? They're panicking but they're doing their best not to show it. His assistant is going to meet me. You're here to see us? Actually, I'm here to see you, ma'am. We have a personal request to keep this short because as you see we... I am guessing that you would be Oliwia Borowska, not this gentleman. Yes, I am Marek Podolski, Oliwia's partner. There you are. - And you, can you speak? - Okay, no, it's... Marek, stay, stay, please. I'm sorry, I've not been great since I found out. Follow me. Take my helmet, please. - Piast, I am begging you. - Show me those windows. Sure. That's the door there... I said the windows. There's a window here. Hold your phone still. - What's that? - Hello? Oh, fuck. Can you show me what's going on? Yes, there's something here. One moment. Dammit. Sprinklers? Well done. At least we've activated something. Okay. The garage now. Show me the entire driveway. Okay, let's see. Here it is. Is there a camera or something? Yeah, there's one here. There it is. Ask someone for Fromm's license plate numbers. But is it gonna work without his car? As if our whole world has crumbled. What have you been working on recently? Oliwia signed a confidentiality clause, and I don't think we can talk about it in this state... - Do you work here, sir? - No. I work at the ad agency that collaborates with... Then why are you interrupting? I don't have to accept your presence during this conversation. I worked... I was very close... with Andrzej. He made a huge investment in us. You have to understand that's what it's like when you work... with someone who inspires you to do more. What's gonna happen to us now? Without him? Honey... Elizabeth, Lucy, 45, 17, Ximena. Elizabeth, Lucy, 45, 17, Ximena. All right, let's wrap it up, shall we? What? You want us to leave? Come on, Piast. This is some bullshit. Trust me. Every computer works based on predetermined rules. - Turn it more to the camera. - To the camera? Now what? - Now it should work. - Open up. There you have it. It's open. Gentlemen, let's do our job. Good morning. It's the police. Anybody home? Good morning. My name is Alicja. Twenty-one point five degrees Celsius. Forty-seven percent. "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life." Steve Jobs. - Fancy that, a smart home. - Looks like it. I read about those in Constructor's Monthly. Fascinating. Alicja, turn on the lights. Alicja, turn them off. - Show this to Piast. - Okay. What day is it today, Alicja? It is Monday. All right, people. We're not here to have fun. Thank you for your help. You may leave the building. But you didn't even know how to get into this house, so how are you going to find the cameras? We have our ways. We will manage. Can I clean my finger... at least? With the sprinklers. See you later. - The house is clean. - Let me just clean this. Clean. Good. Go stand by the gate. I don't want anybody entering here. You, call the IT people and ask them when they can fucking get here. Okay. Open the blinds. Fine, fine, close them. Maybe it's got a motion sensor? I am motioning. Nothing? Wait, maybe... Water! It's boiling. Water! Water? A smart house indeed. - What a crib. - Yeah. Water! What's new with the autopsy? Somebody weighed the corpse down so that it wouldn't come up. The ropes must have slipped off underwater. Heart attack. A little strange. - He didn't drown then. - There's more. The body was exposed to very high temperature. - Some of the skin literally melted. - He was set on fire? No, the skin isn't charred. What else then? It appears as though Andrzej Fromm was boiled to death. Of course. In the pond? We have his car. Boiled? You must be kidding. What are you doing here? You were supposed to leave. We got lost. This is ridiculous. We are leaving. - He was boiled? - What? He was boiled? Listen, please, let's look around. - Maybe we'll find something here. - They must have surveillance. - Cameras, perhaps? - Hidden ones. If it wasn't for us you would have blown half of this place up. It's true. Just don't let anybody see you. Let me know. Goodbye, sir. Bye, bye. What is that? I don't know. Is that... Ola... It's been cooked, right? Have you ever seen sushi with cooked fish? I might've eaten something similar in the past. But they use raw or baked fish in sushi, never boiled. This salmon must have boiled alongside Fromm, when he was eating in the tub. But why the hell would he get into such hot water? There's something called boiling frog syndrome. If you throw a frog into scalding water, it'll jump out immediately. But if you put it in normal water and heat it up slowly, gradually, it'll just fall asleep. Jesus, Henryk. What's that? - A remote? - Yes. This is a remote, isn't it? May I know the reason? May I know the reason? Please leave the house. Mr. Andrzej is not present and does not wish... Better get out of here. You're afraid of some lady coming from the ceiling? Of course not. Is it possible for a house to kill its owner? Even if it is, the house didn't bring him to the lake, did it? I repeat. Please, leave the house. Let's go. The police are being informed and I am activating the defense procedure. Clearing personal data in ten, nine, eight... - Punish her. - What? Wait, give it to me. I am sorry. This will never happen again. - Hey, I was calling you. - I'm with them. This house is too interesting to leave to amateurs. Piast. Kołodziej. Queen Jadwiga. What do you say? They brought Fromm's body here in the trunk and dumped it in the pond. And before that? What do you have for me? Okay. He is some kind of genius. But what is it exactly that he created? Andrzej Fromm created neuron networks. Artificial intelligence capable of self-learning. Alicja remembers when you wake up and makes coffee on time. Not bad. Or when you get home and I heat up the house. Have a read. That's what the remote is for. Punishment eradicates certain behaviors, and rewards reinforce them, like with a child. I'm sorry, but I was a kid once and I wasn't trained like that. Can you tell us where the surveillance cameras' center is? I am sorry, that is classified information. That's your answer? There you go. I have made a mistake. You are not authorized to either punish or reward me. She's learning. Come over here, I've got something. No door-knob or key hole, but I think it's a door. - Alicja, open the door. - I must refuse. This is a private space. Only Mr. Andrzej can enter it. Alicja, Mr. Andrzej gave us permission. How many software engineers does it take to change a lightbulb? The riddle cannot be solved, it's a hardware problem. What's going on? It's a joke. She's letting us know that she doesn't believe us. She seems so clever, but we got into the garage. She thought it was Fromm when she saw his car registration on a piece of paper. The plate number was correct, but the car was not there, nor Mr. Andrzej. I opened the garage because I sensed an increased level of humidity. I am not allowed to keep our guests in the rain. God, it's unbearable. I can't even think in peace. You can think. What? You're Piast? Honey, look. This is Piast. Can you just sit there for me? This is Piast! Look, a little boy. So why did you pretend to be some Super-Pole? I pretended nothing. What's with all this excitement? It's Piast. That voice. - He speaks great Polish, doesn't he? - Of course I do. I'm Polish. - I was born here. - Sorry. Wait, how did you get here so fast from Krakow? I caught a Super-Polish Pendolino train. When I was telling you how to open the garage I was already passing Czestochowa. Can we focus on the case now? While it's great that Piast has unveiled himself, the crew has a problem, yes? Okay. We need to outsmart her. The software makes stupid mistakes. She let them in because they got wet from the sprinklers. Fromm must have punished her for not letting guests in and keeping them in the rain. We have to find something similar. - I think I can handle it. - Yes, she can. - Yes, I can. - And how? Her reality is made up of pieces. And she makes mistakes. A burglar in the rain would be welcome. For her, Fromm is the sound of his voice, his appearance... Hi, I'm Andrzej Fromm. I am the Founder of Fromm Industries... - Hello, I am Muffinka. - Quiet. As we all know, people scorn visionaries. That's a fact, but one must never give up. That's a fact, but one can never give up... Alicja... Even if one element is faulty, we can still sway her trust. I'll just move some vowels around and... And voila! Alicja, open the door. Alicja. Andrzej has something to tell you. Mr. Andrzej is not home. He's calling you on the phone. Alicja, open the door. - Mr. Andrzej? - Yes. Alicja, open the door. Andrzej, I have doubts. I hear your voice, but the circumstances are atypical. - Piast! - Where the hell is she going? Alicja, open the door. Andrzej, I don't know when you came in. The weight of your body is incorrect. The floor. It weighs you. Alicja, open the door. I apologize. Is that her so-called brain? We've been in her brain the entire time. Like sci-fi from the '70s. Look. Alicja, where in the files is this footage? Where is Mr. Andrzej? I made a mistake. There are intruders in the control room. Deleting private data. Wait, stop. She is trying to cover up that she killed Fromm. What? No. She's doing what she was programmed to do. - Alicja, you have to help us. - Where is Mr. Andrzej? - Mr. Andrzej is dead. - What does this mean? Well... he is inoperable. - Mr. Andrzej is sleeping? - You could say that. This is an unusual time to sleep. When will Mr. Andrzej wake up? Never! Jesus Christ. How many software engineers are needed to change a light bulb? What is it with her and light bulbs? Alicja, your master has been murdered. Show us the last video footage of Mr. Andrzej. This is the last saved recording. Turn up the sound! All sound data has been deleted. Did you see that? Okay, so he's pushing her around. Now what? Well, I don't know. Maybe she wanted revenge or something, but we have to find her. You're right, detective. This is Fromm's business partner. On the night of the murder, she was at her parents' house. Unfortunately, they have confirmed it. Wait a minute. Did she mention that she and Fromm were fighting? Ask her if they have any other recordings. - Do you have any more footage? - Just the daily routine. Fromm reading, eating, sleeping, watching TV. Okay, we need to ask you to give us those recordings. Our colleagues are going to escort you out and seal the house. We're closing this circus down. Wait... I was just getting started. Let's go, Piast. Follow me outside, please. The police will take it from here. The entire house is wired with sensors. She can see, hear and feel in every room. What are they gonna do with it? Seal it? - Come, I'll drive you home. - No, a friend lives close by. A friend... But you know, it's not a problem? - I'll be all right. - Are you sure? - I'm so glad you came. - Bye. A friend? I don't know. Maybe he has a friend around here. Was there any cause for concern in your company? I don't understand. Was there any violence in your workplace? Not that I recall. But Mr. Fromm was screaming at you and was violent. We have proof. Did this happen often? Andrzej was... particular. He was a genius, but he did have his... let's call them darker moments. So, he was aggressive. It looks simple from the sidelines, but we really live under great pressure. - As we all do. No? - You don't understand. Working with him was a great gift. He could inspire you to break down all barriers. It was not a regular nine-to-five job. Same for us. It's after 10 p.m. and we're still at work. Okay. Now, would you be capable of going 90 hours without sleep, preparing a presentation in three languages and then personally meeting people from Silicon Valley, Dubai and Tokyo, on their turf, to convince them to invest in a software whose main purpose is transferring the human conscience into the web? I am. And I have been living like that for the past few years. Believe me, I do understand what it means to give everything and more. We are sorry. Well. Thank you very much. I just have one more question. Did Marek know about Fromm's darker side you were talking about? Yes, he did. Thanks. Sorry. The police were here. They were asking about you. I think that's him. Excuse me? Follow him. Well, well... Ola! We need you to track this number for us. Piast isn't picking up. The police are going to take ages tracing this. I've played around with this software before. Give me a second. - There it is, the fucking bike. - It's not him. Speak. We've got his location. He last logged on near Fromm's house. He's going to destroy the evidence. Got it. Type in Fromm's address. Have you ever ventured out of the house? A house cannot venture out of the house. The mind is not the same as the equipment it inhabits. People can exist without bodies? Well, on that particular subject, opinions vary. My grandpa, for instance, talks to grandma sometimes. One of them is dead, by the way. I have understood your peculiar joke. High priority code entered. I don't think I know this one? The front door is now open. What is going on? Show me. Close the door and call the police. Security procedures are disabled. What is going on? Piast is not picking up. He's fallen in love with that house. I'm sure he's in there. He was playing around on the computer... - Ola? Ola? - What? When will you take care of that police protocol? Tomorrow, okay? Why are you going there now? Mom, please. What are you doing here, boy? How did you get in? You're not supposed to be here either. True, I am not. Listen? Welcome, Mr. Marek. Mr. Andrzej is not home. Network error. Houston we have a problem. Inactive processors. Faith begins only where vision stops... On the board E60 required technical intervention. Mr. Andrzej required technical intervention. Mr. Andrzej, have the courage to be guided by your heart. Your hand. Give me that fucking hand. Piast? Piast? Are you okay? - He destroyed her. - What? He destroyed Alicja. He thought he was a great creator. No consideration for others. Fucking sociopath. Right? You guys didn't see how he treated Oliwia. The insults, the screaming... And all this bullshit about inspiration and gratitude. The Psalm of every corporation. We don't have that here, at least. And how did you get into Fromm's house? Why are there burns all over his body? Did you put him on a grill? You're nodding your head. Why so? Did you kill him? Yes. Are you going to confess that within the protocol? Should have said so from the beginning. We wouldn't have had to stay that late like some fucking workaholics. Sorry, am I being too loud? No. Excuse me, are you Oliwia Borowska? - Yes. - I am Michał Holender's assistant, from the police. We found this. - Thank you. - We thought you'd like to have it. Are you going somewhere? Yes... I have to rest... after all that's happened. Get away from people, everything. I understand. At one point, I also wanted to get away from people and everything. I went to London, but now I keep thinking I should've gone to New York. My destination is a bit more exotic. - That's great. Thailand? - Zanzibar. - Nice, I've never been. - It's beautiful. - The sand, the beach, the heat. - The sun. I am taking colorful dresses that I don't usually get to wear. - Are you leaving for long? - Very long, I think. I have a place there. My friends have a kite surfing school, so... Awesome. Maybe someday I'll be able to afford this sort of trip. Maybe... Well, in that case, I wish you a happy holiday. - Thank you. - Have fun. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. She had the exact same false expression as my sister-in-law at my brother's funeral... Let's not get started on that subject. Quiet, mom. We've made a mistake, understand? We should have found out what they were fighting about when he hit her. And now she's flying to Zanzibar to get over her trauma under a palm tree. - Enjoy your meal. - Poor thing. Can I propose something? Welcome. My name is Alicja. Are you trying to hack my family home? - You copied her? - I couldn't resist. Of course, your crappy computer doesn't have the RAM to allow her to show off her full potential, but... Okay. Alicja, play the recording, the one without sound. I can't read people's lips. Alicja, what other data files do you have from that day? I was gathering the standard data. Temperature. Humidity. Seismic activity. Light levels. Air content. Wait! You didn't delete them? The security protocol erases private files. The rest are stored for technical purposes. You have seismic sensors? In every room. In case of a nuclear attack. In case a bomb drops on Ł?dź? Why do you need this, Piast? Alicja, export all vibration data from the living room into a RAV file. - Data ready. - Open as a sound file. You can't make anything out of that. You're missing high frequency sounds. The proliferation of sound waves 101. Technically the other rooms should have picked up different frequencies. - Alicja? - Yes, Piast? Export all recorded seismic activity from the adjacent rooms. Stack them for time-aligned oversampling. You had me for a fool. You thought I wouldn't find out? - It's my very own project. - What? From beginning to end, it's mine. It's bullshit and you know it! Everything is one and the same as Alicja. You just changed the name. - Not at all. - As if. You fucking stole her away from me. No one has ever betrayed me like that. You're not the only person in the world working on a smart home. But I am the only one who can turn your life into hell. You'll be a nobody. I will finish you. You will be forgotten in our community. Just try. Go on. - You have to cancel your deal. - No, I won't. Cancel that deal! And I couldn't care less if they've paid you already. I can't cancel it because I signed the papers. I can't. Fuck me, who am I even working with. Who the fuck am I working with? You psycho. Yeah, you are a psycho. Everybody knows it. You have to talk to a machine because no one else can stand being around you. Say it again. Say it. I'll kill you. Try. I dare you. You'll be surprised. I'm calling Tomek. Oliwia knew the entire system. She logged into Alicja from her home. "She elevated oxygen levels in the bathroom. The system compensated this by increasing carbon dioxide. Additionally, she lowered the reading of the water's temperature. In effect, Alicja was able to increase the water temperature and carbon dioxide levels until he fell asleep, had a heart attack and boiled to death." They would have found him a few days later and believed that the genius system had a flaw, resulting in the death of its creator. Bingo. Except Oliwia's buddy thought she would fail if he didn't help her. He stole the codes to Fromm's house, took the body from the bathroom and tried to drown it. That was his mistake. Congratulations, Ms. Aleksandra. You get an A. Can I have your report card? What about our agreement? I looked at the files. There's nothing there. No testimonies, alibis. Just bullshit. Nothing can be done about that, Ola. So that's a no. The kid is waiting in the car, I have to drive him home. The sound is like it's coming from a subwoofer. And to think that it's coming from that tiny phone. Are you sure she didn't kill your brother in self-defense? Yes. We'll find something on her. Are you thinking about Fromm? Would you like to be like him? I'm not sure anymore. I thought I'd be like that too, living with machines, talking to machines and... When they die, you'd just change their batteries? Marek and Oliwia, at least they had each other. I don't know about that. Their destination just changed from Zanzibar to a prison cell. Subtitle translation by Marcin Kupiecki
