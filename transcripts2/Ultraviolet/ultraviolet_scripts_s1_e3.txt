 I'LL DO ALL TO PUSH REFUGEES OUT OF GŁAZOWO Explosion in the office of Karol Brodzki... WILL YOU ACCEPT REFUGEES IN YOUR TOWN? ...regional leader of the True Poland Movement, known for his reluctance towards refugees. Lately, he's been trying to block the arrival of several Syrian families. Dear all, I wanted to thank you for your support. I am alive and well. Apparently, the Providence of God is looking after me. I would also like to thank my wife, Maria. Thank you, my love! Please, let's not be fooled! I'm not the only one with enemies,

 Poland has its enemies, too. All those false liberal slogans come to mind now. Slogans of openness, tolerance. We will not be out of touch! Quite the opposite, it is our time now. That day will come! All that in Henryk's countryside. Who would have thought, no? Well, it's not the countryside, it's a small town in the suburbs of Łódź. That is not the point. The point is that they have arrived. - What have? - The attacks. England is afraid, France is afraid. Now it is here. Come on. What attacks? Did everybody go crazy or what? You hear "explosion" and you think it was an attack. Something blew up, something just blew up. The thing is that this Brodzki did not want refugees in Głazowo,

 - so they set his office on fire. - Have you seen my phone? I thought you had it glued to your hand. - No. - You're just like your father. You don't see what is happening around you, not at all. I do, I do. That's why you have such problems with Kamil. Issues with Kamil are entirely my fault, aren't they? No, it's that you have this thing, when you don't want to see a problem, you ignore it. I see them! For instance, I can see that you don't leave home unless you're driven to the place you wanna go. I'd prefer to stay here than to get in the car with you! Yeah, it's as if I was to blame. Mom, you're glued to the couch! - I can't even walk yet! - I know. And that's the problem! All right, no point in fighting. Here! Good morning. - Morning. - Everything all right? Yeah. I'm Sergeant Nogaś. We found a body. - What are the firemen saying? - They say it's gas. - Hello! A gas explosion? - A deliberate unseal... A deliberate unsealing of the gas installation? - That's what I'm saying. - You mean an attack? Well, it's a politician's office, no? In a minute they'll make a martyr out of him. You know what's going on around the world right now. Information about the body cannot get through to the press. That will not be easy. There is an election coming up. - True. - Did you tell anyone? Only my wife, but she won't say a thing. Did Brodzki have an alarm system, any surveillance cameras? There was a camera with a memory card but it melted in the fire. We have secured the city surveillance recordings. City surveillance. Congratulations. Okay, we'll check the recordings. - We are taking over this case. Goodbye. - How come? The investigation into the explosion is in progress. ACCIDENT OR ASSASSINATION? The police have made their first arrest after analyzing surveillance cameras' footage. It's a young man of Arabic origin, Damascus. Brodzki's supporters are convinced the perpetrator was from the immigrant community. - Hi, Amir. - Henryk! My son, Fadi, was arrested. Tell me, what's going on? This morning, the police came and took him. What did he have to do with it? Cameras, surveillance. He was around office before explosion. Come in. Fadi didn't do it. Henryk, please! I don't know who I can talk to. - But what can I do, Amir? - Prove Fadi innocent. The whole country sings with us, get the fuck out, you dirty scum! What happened was not an attack on my father and the values he represents! It was a brutal rape against us, who vocalize our opposition to globalization, leftism and a wave of immigration. These plagues are destroying our beloved Old Continent and the culture that our core Polish values come from! We don't tolerate and won't tolerate any strangers here! We unite against the European civilization with no values, and the Islamic plague! We, the real patriots, say no! POLAND FOR POLES We, the real patriots, are ready to fight! The whole country sings with us, get the fuck out, you dirty scum! The whole country sings with us... Let's destroy this Syrian bar! Hey, let him go, you hear me? Let him go! - The fuck are you blabbing about? - I'm not blabbing. What's your problem? Why? Are you going to hit me now, you knight in shining armor? Hey! I hope you're not bothering this lady? Can I help you in any way? No, thank you. I'm just admiring this commotion. If you vote for me in the parliamentary election, I'll renovate this place for you. Can we ask you to remove the sunglasses? This conversation is being recorded. Do you know this man? From TV. They showed his arrest. - Detention. - He didn't confess? Investigation's in progress. Meaning it is all in your hands now. I just know he worked at that Syrian's bar. Have you received any threats recently? Non-stop! Ever since I tried to prevent all that Syrian trash from arriving here. - Trash? - Trash. It seems to me that you are referring to Syrian refugees. Semantics. Do you have any proof emails, hateful messages? This explosion is not enough for you? Isn't that proof? It's a freaking miracle I'm speaking with you right now. This is confidential, for the good of the case, but in fact someone has died. A person has died? My God! Who? We're still investigating. Where did they die? You should have told everyone, people have the right to know! Do not share this information with anyone, please. That scumbag should be hanged. We don't know if it's him who's behind the arson. Evidence will show. Maybe you could reach out to your people and calm them down a little? Apparently you have some influence over them. - Good day. - Amir, Salima. Hello. I'm Ola. Nice to meet you. A girl? We need a policeman, and we have a girl instead! I know it may look strange but I know people who can help you. They solve the crimes that the police don't want to look at or the ones that they couldn't solve. For example... did they take your son's computer? Don't tell her a thing, Amir. She's a stranger. I trust him. - Tea? - No, thank you. When I drink, it's usually something unhealthy. Or something that has a lot of caffeine. Otherwise I fall asleep behind the wheel. Don't worry about it. I hid it from the police. Great. Maybe let's start with the social media accounts? Wait, did you learn how to bypass the password on a PC? Yeah. Can you imagine? Few more weeks and you'll replace Piast in this group! Good. He will be able to devote himself to a career in karaoke. - Sing us that song you used to sing. - Focus. The profile. Boring. Few friends... mostly Syrians. Why does he have that on his wall? WHAT WILL HANG WILL NOT DROWN He's left a comment. Hieroglyphs. Okay, I'll ask his parents what it means. Henryk? TRANSLATE - Chill, I got this. - Okay, never mind. - It's okay. - Yeah. "Those unable to empathize deserve hell". Did you think he'd be in the office or did you just want to scare him? Fadi? Anyway, if you wanted to hurt him then you kind of failed. Brodzki is alive. Somebody else has died. You can get up to 25 years in prison for a dead body. But if you'd decide to cooperate... Article 163 of the Penal Code. Leading to a dangerous event resulting in accidental death. If you confess and apologize, you'll get 12 years... you'll get out after eight. There is a difference between eight and 25, if you ask me. From the pathologist. At last. I'm talking to a wall. Asija Elazar. Same chick everywhere. There might be something more to this story, no? She even looks cool in a hijab. Like a model. Great eyes? I'm no expert. They have been friends for a long time, no? More than friends, I think. An Arab girl and an explosion. In Brodzki's office. Did you work together? She died by accident? - How did this happen? - Speak Polish. - How did this happen? - Look what you have done! How did this happen? How did this happen? Calm down. We want to help you. Hear me? Brodzki! Brodzki. He should be the one who's dead! Easy. Easy now. We'll stay in touch. Okay? Oh, no! Can you tell me what you're doing here? We're visiting our friends. Amir is Henryk's friend and they need our help because somebody put their son in jail. Exactly. - Can you do something about it? - No. Excuse me, but this is absurd! You don't know shit about this boy! - You come to this house and... - Ola, calm down, please. - Okay, what now? - Why can't we see Fadi? The case is complicated. We have found a dead body at the office. - A young woman, Asija Elazar. - Michał, Fadi's innocent. He loved that girl. He would have never done that. Ola, calm down. We have the same assumptions. All right. Were Fadi and Asija making something together recently? You mean babies? Or preparing the attack? Because I don't know what Asija was doing in Brodzki's office? Can you finally shut the fuck up, little girl? No, sorry. Please, leave now. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I'm really sorry about that. They want to hang this Arab guy by the balls. Police have the culprit; you crazy? They don’t know if he’s guilty. you’re fucking crazy yourself. Only the violets, I mean this group, UV, think he's innocent. You want to save the world? Again? It's enough that I save you from time to time. I love you. A little gift. For me? There are only two of these. - Who's got the other one? - The Prince of Austria. You know, I pity that boy. He's got nobody on his side. There's no evidence. My husband... He hates Brodzki. He always called him a fascist and always wanted to get rid of him. Get rid of him? How? Meanwhile, the internet has spoken again. Someone claims they have info about the real person behind the explosion. - Someone, meaning? - He only agreed to a one-on-one. Where? I'll send you the address. - You mean I am supposed to go? - I can't, it's my shift at the airport. I've got it. I have my red stallion. I can ride the world. Easy. Sent it. Do you have it? I do. Jesus! Sorry, beautiful, wrong address. I'm just sitting here, waiting for my buddy. Okay, bro. What's up with this explosion? - You're from the UV? - Don't exaggerate, but... Would you like to drink something? Oh, thank you. Coming to this bar and leaving without ordering a meat chop... is like visiting Amsterdam and not smoking a joint. Dieting? No. More like conscious consumption. Get it. Let's go back to that guy, the producer of tights. Kmiecik, yeah? He has tons of dollars but is not interested in politics. Why would he get himself into this kind of situation? He has recently won an auction for some land in the center of town, but Brodzki has revoked it. - Isn't that too little for a motive? - He'd been buying land for years. If Brodzki hadn't stopped him, he'd be the owner of half of this town. Power. Okay. What about evidence that he's behind the explosion? Before he was a tights manufacturer, he was taking off with the local boys. GANGSTER OR PHILANTHROPIST? Begins to sound like mafia... Everybody knows it. Brodzki is the only person standing in his way. - Where did you get this information? - From a trusted person. A chick. Or his wife? Anyway, I wanna talk to her. Out of the question. They are a respected family. Why do you want to help? When I was in a similar situation... nobody reached out to help me. Gonna pay for it? Hey! Check out Kmiecik's website. I bet all the Ultras are excited about the bomb, no? - "Ultras"? Nice. - What? Sounds like Łódź slang. Yeah, well, whatever they are called... You're hurting me! - Not so fast. Are you going somewhere? - Anywhere, to be honest. - It's open! - Wait up... It's open! Hey, Ania. - Did you do that on purpose? - Told you to hurry up. Help me. Not you! You look great. You could have asked for my opinion! - No need to be hysterical. - Really, you're in great shape. You should work on a more effective exit if you're about to become a drama queen. Shut it, little brat! A margherita. Dorota, come check this out! Cute guy. Can we have him in UV? - Kinda pathetic. - What? He kind of looks like James Franco. How? Look. Listen to your sister. Let's get back to Kmiecik. NEW COLLECTION WE INVITE YOU TO KMIECIK POL Is this how he made all his money? Kinda lame? Look! Is that Asija? Tomek, are you sure it's Asija? Positive. James Franco sent me this article. GANGSTER OR PHILANTHROPIST? Kmiecik was about to finance Syrian families' stay in Głazowo. While Brodzki wanted to prevent them from coming. What did Asija have to do with all that? Can I also... Just... Can I? - Go on! - But what do you want to do? I wanted to try something... more analogue. Hello! Gas maintenance. Anton! Where did he go? Miruś? Remember when the general came in drunk, because he was looking for his room... and he finally fell asleep on the sink. It's either you or me! What are you here for? I don't suppose you were looking for gas underneath my desk? I'm not going to lie to you. A certain girl, Asija, once worked at your company. I'm investigating this case for her parents. Poor girl. She convinced me to finance those Syrian families' stay. Look. Asija... do you know what that means, Miruś? "She, who loves". Nice. I didn't know she helped the refugees come here. They are killing them over there, in that war. And here... this shithead, Brodzki, has five prosecutor's charges for forgery. He deprived me of legally purchased land. So what? He can do whatever he likes because he hides himself behind the flag... and you don't touch such people, because it's not patriotic. If you wanna know who killed that girl, Miruś, then I will show you. And I know you're not Miruś and you don't know shit about the army... but you're a fucking good man, and I know people well. Who killed that girl? Here's all you need to know. POLICE Excuse me. You can't go in there. - I need to help my son. - I understand, but... - Yes? - Brodzki had a love affair with Asija. Give me a break. Bye. Fuck. You did all you could. You have hired a good lawyer. Now you need to be patient. Excuse me. Where did these come from? Who would want the girl killed? I don't know. Brodzki. If the photos leaked, he'd be finished. Take it easy now. We'll check it. Bye! Do you recognize this woman? As far as I know she died in the explosion at my office. You have already shown me that. - Do you remember her name? - Why would I? Were you and Asija acquainted personally? - Next question. - I will need your precise answer. Of course not. Do you confirm that those pictures... show yourself and Asija Elazar? - Who else has seen them? - Do you confirm... Listen, you piece of shit! If these photographs are leaked to the media, nobody's going to protect you. Do you hear me? The prosecutor is going to smash your ass... I do remind you that you're present here for an explanation, you're not charged with anything. Were you and Asija Elazar supposed to meet in your office that night? No. Do you know why she went there? No idea. - She knew I was leaving. - Who will be able to confirm that? Mr. Karol? It's not like it doesn't get to me... that she's not here anymore, all right? Are you guys sitting down? Hey, Piast. I'm driving. What's up? - Listen! Fadi is clean! - Fuck! I knew it! Tell me! I went through the surveillance videos and did some math. If you want an explosion, you will need about 15 percent gas in the room. Gas mixes with air, then you have a spark and boom! - An explosion! Do you understand? - Not really, but good thing I have a chemistry professor at home. And I'm going to work in a moment, so hurry. So, Brodzki's office is 36 square meters. In order to fill it with 15 percent gas, you need twenty minutes. What time was Fadi in front of the office? Forty-six minutes after midnight. The explosion took place at 55 past midnight. Which is nine minutes later. That's not enough time to fill the room with gas. Straight up. Well, done Piast. High five, fist bump. And? - He has an alibi. - Brodzki? Oh, please! He says he was away. He wasn't in Łódź that day. - But... - He didn't do it. Fadi is innocent. We've got evidence. You have to let him out. Ola, don't talk to me about evidence. This fascist would not get his hands dirty, he hired someone! It's not about fascism. It's about politics. Politics is a game. A game about a game. Pretending. Do you understand? So... do you really think those pictures will end him? I don't know. But if that's the case, he will skillfully be replaced by his son. I have a feeling we will miss Mr. Karol. Sorry, I don't understand. - You don't have to. - You sound like my mother. It comes from a place of love. REAL PATRIOTS REAL PATRIOTS - MEETINGS Calm down, silly you. I actually kinda wanted to talk to you. First of all, I wanted to congratulate you. Your father is surely a favorite in the group's vice-president election, - am I right? - We're interested in politics, I see? A 16 percent jump in the polls in two days. Not bad! That dirt-bag accidentally helped us. And now he will be jailed for the attack. I'll be right back. What's going on? I heard a weird conversation on the phone. Between Ola and some people. - Then she hung up. - What conversation? I don't know. Is there a place where they meet? You know, the Real Patriots, or whatever they are called. No, no! Go home. I know everything. Great. Take that knowledge far away from me. So, guys. You're so righteous? Check this out! What's that? An entire gallery. Just slide to the left or right. - What the fuck is that? - Come on, she's made some fakes. This girl had a love affair with his father. That's why she got killed. - What are you talking about? - You knew about it, didn't you? - Fucking tell me! - Shut your mouth! - She was scum! - Fuck it! Even if that's not a fake, so what? Maybe he fucked her, maybe she seduced him. That's what they do, right? - Yes, and then you just blew her up! - So what? She asked for it. She deserved it. Maybe I just put things back in order? Of course. And maybe my father will be grateful. Freeze! Police! All of you, on the ground! I said on the ground! Turn around! Turn around! Let her go! Fucking let her... Can you tell us what you were doing there? I was checking if she was safe. Asija? Why? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. She didn't want me, but I kept on fighting for her. You will say that you knew nothing. That you deeply regret it. After all, that was not your fault. The lawyer will soon get here from Warsaw, he will explain everything. Don't talk to anyone. You have seen nothing, you know nothing. Go away. What's that now? I said go away. We have to get out of this situation, son. We have to cooperate! I'm ashamed of you. I want to have nothing to do with you. I don't regret a thing. - Daniel! - She was not a woman, she was scum. I did what was right for our cause. My child... what are you saying? I don't have a father. You don't exist to me. A day will come when people like you will be eliminated... and I will be the one pulling the trigger. Do you hear me? Smashing you one by one like bugs. That day will come! A major break in the Głazowo incident. All about the person who fooled us all and the whole truth about the explosion... People are awful to one another. - Don't blame yourself. - For what, exactly? I thought you were talking about the way you are treating Henryk. Can I sit peacefully in my kitchen, in my apartment, in Łódź, Poland? Can I? It's Henryk, mom! Why are you doing this to him? Maybe I don't want a strange man walking around my house? Well, maybe it's time that you start a new life. Look at all the time that has passed by since... - Dad... - He had many flaws. Many. But he was mine. Did he ever cheat on you? Once. When he died. - Hello, Pippa Middleton speaking. - Hey. Olka? Fuck! Two months. Felt like eternity to me. I couldn't call you earlier. You didn't want to. I understand. I just wanted to tell you before you start... Hello? - Something interrupted the call. - It did. I just wanted to tell you... I'm fucking sorry. Maybe there is some... Maybe you could come here? Or I'll go to you? Are you there? Hello? - Yes, I'm here. - So talk to me, please. What am I supposed to do? I'd like to make things right. There must be some... - I just don't know how. - I don't know, Kamil. I don't know. Neither do I. Subtitle translation by Marcin Kupiecki
