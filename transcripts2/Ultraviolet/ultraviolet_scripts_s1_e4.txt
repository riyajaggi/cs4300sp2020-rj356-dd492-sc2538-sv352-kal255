 Freakin' hell! What are you doing? Do you want to die? Chilli Zet Radio. Tune into the chill-out. You were supposed to be faster. Isn't it a requirement that you have a driver's license for a few years before you start driving others? It is. I've been driving for a while now but it doesn't change anything. - All right, I think I will get out. - Don't! It'll clear up in a minute! Do you have to terrorize passengers like that? This goddamn ringtone is driving me nuts! It's irritating. I am not surprised you have such low ratings.

 If you only knew how little I care about those. - I'm out. Thank you very much. - You are welcome. Jerk. What? Mom? You're in agony? Dying? What is it? You wish. But not this time. Although we are all getting closer to death with every instant. Great, but why do you keep calling me? I'm working! - I have this favor to ask. - A big one? No bigger than staying with someone for weeks on end. Catering included. What catering? Your fridge is permanently empty. - Listen, it's about your cop-friend. - Yes, Michał. You need to get together with him. Because I need that form from the police, understand? I need it to get that sticker with the wheelchair,

 so I can use disabled parking places. But you never drive anywhere! But I will when I get the sticker! He doesn't deal with this sort of thing. Besides, he isn't "mine." I don't know. Give me the number and I'll make the call myself. Not an option! You won't be calling him! Okay, I'll talk to him myself. Mom, I wanted... Could you do that for me? Please? Pretty please! - I will do that for you. - Thank you. Wait. Not in front of the child. Come with me darling, okay? Come on, don't be scared. There we go! I asked how she got the name, but she didn't say. I was driving down the road. It was dark. I had to swerve to avoid hitting her. I got out of the car. I looked at her and saw the blood on her hands. - Come with me for a second. - Monika, can you look after her? I'm sorry, write it all down, all right? Let's start from the beginning. You were driving down the road... Yes. It was 5, 5:30. It was dark. In the woods. And at some point, she ran out. Did you call Child Services? Yes, but I don't know when they'll come. - They made cuts to their staff. - Fuck! So we are to play kindergarten teachers? She was just standing on the road. I didn't know who she was. I saw her for the first time. She had a knife in her hands. And those terrifying eyes... Hey there! I'm Ola. And you? This is a strange place, isn't it? I bet you don't like it here. I don't like it here either. Any ideas what she was doing with that knife? Well, first we identify the girl. Also, the lab must determine whose blood was on the knife. And we have to call a doctor. Let him examine her. Good. I'm waiting to see the results. Listen, do you know where I wish I was right now? Home. Do you wish, you were home right now? No? Oh, hi! Who let her in here? What are you doing? What's this? Could you arrest my mother? Just kidding. I need the report from the car accident. What report? You know, the case of the lady from the overpass. I completely forgot about it but we need it for the insurance. Wrong floor. That's something for the traffic department. Who is this child? You don't know, do you? That guy said he found her in the woods, knife in hand, yes? - Listen, if you need our help... - Stop. I beg you, Ola! Thank you very much. Delete that picture. Can somebody fix this door, already? Girl found in forest. Lots of blood. Can't identify her or parents. My dears! Remember our three steps! First, the dirty work, also known as eye make-up. Second, cleaning the smudges. base, foundation, powder. This will make your job so much easier. Okay, I am ready. We can record this. - Come here. - What's up? Come here for a sec. There's a new case. An eight-year-old girl. We want to identify her. - Poor thing. Look. - She's so cute. The girl was found on a road outside of Łódź. What's she wearing? Is that polyester? More like cretonne. Totally old-school. Vintage. Looks like second-hand. I am not following, but that's okay. Men. This frock is twenty years old. Maybe it's a costume? Right. Search through social media. - For an eight-year-old? - She may be on her parents' photos. Judging by that dress I doubt her parents have a computer. A typewriter, maybe. Piast, what about your facial recognition software? The one that mistook me for Dorota? That actually is not the program's fault. Don't be a smartass, Piast. Not the program's fault, yeah? Fucking piece of shit. This is either a mistake or... I don't know, I don't get any of this. Strange. Piast, you're a genius, man! Come here. It's important! It's important! It's important! It's important! It's important! THE KIDNAPPING OF A LITTLE GIRL On Tuesday, 3 June, 8-year-old Maja Barska went missing. - What is that? - Show me your phone. Did you go upstairs to take care of your insurance? Yes, I took care of it. Show me that. That girl in the newspaper is Maja Barska. She went missing twenty years ago. They're identical. Almost. We found traces of blood in two other places. - Nothing aside from that. - What do you mean, "nothing"? - We're trying... - Stop trying. Just find something! We have to contact Barska's family, run some DNA tests. I've sent someone to check the address mentioned in that article. An actual policeman or that angry blonde? Who has zillions of internet friends? Everything aside, she did help us a bit. - You wanna join them? - It's not my style. Why don't we give up our badges and start playing some fucking internet detectives? And? Ms. Barska's address no longer exists. The house has been demolished to make room for new apartment buildings. Guess we have to inform the media that we're looking for her. Don't know what else to do. There are two things I hate. One of them is the media. Let's refrain for now. My darlings, today's video is a little bit more serious. We need your help. We are looking for information... What's wrong with you today? Let's do one more. Focus! - Okay! - And, action! My darlings, today's video is a little bit more serious. We need your help. We are looking for information about a mysterious little girl who might be the daughter of Maja Barska. She went missing years ago. If anyone knows anything about either one of them, we ask you to give that information to us. I am counting on you! Maybe someone will come forward. I'm sure the police are looking through the files of that case. I'll look at the press. Maybe someone wrote more about it. So, going way back to the good old '90s? Please, Piast. Thanks, Piast. You know, some of us were already alive in the '90s. Nineties! Laughable. - There you go. - What is this? The form. Thanks. You can be helpful when you want to be. Was that a compliment? I have to write it down in my diary. Stop it. I do praise you sometimes. Anna, so, after all, you do love me a little bit? Children are born out of love. Right. So that's why Kamil and I don't have children. - I was just going to say that. - Seriously? Stop it. Maybe you'll find somebody out there. It won't be easy, but... - Thanks. - Who's that? - Hi, there. - Hi. - How's she doing today? - Same as always. Hello. I saw my friend at the traffic department today, to get you that sticker for disabled drivers. Ola, have you told the entire town about my problems? You did ask for help yourself. Thanks. But Ola already took care of that. I did not. I only brought you the form. You just need to fill this in, it's all been taken care of. - Well, thank you. - Are you hungry? - Ola! - What? You're cooking anyway. That's right. The Cripple's Inn is always open, 24/7. In fact, I do miss homemade meals. Did you just make two pierogi today or what? Fine. Go for it. No, you sit back down. Sit. Since you already sat at the table, stay put! All right. The internet has spoken. We have the address of Helena Barska, - the mother of that girl. - Maja's mother? - Yes, she lives in your city. - Where did you get that info? From a fan. Apparently, Helena Barska is his aunt. He says that Maja was kidnapped as a child. Supposedly by a mysterious man. And her mother is still in mourning. Text me the address. Either Michał will go there, or I... - Sure thing. Okay! - That Michał, is he handsome? - I only know about women. - Right. He looks a bit like me. How am I supposed to talk to your mother? She's so stubborn. Have I mentioned anything about that stupid hip or the surgery? I didn't even have a chance to ask her how she was. You didn't have to. She asks questions, then answers them herself. - You two are very much alike. - Please, Henryk! I don't poke my nose into other people's business. Really? She just really worries about you. Did you talk to Kamil? Since you decided to come with me, can you check the address on this? - How do you turn this on? - On the right. It's not working. - Hello. - Good day. - My name is Aleksandra Serafin. - Henryk Bak. Good day. - Are you Helena Barska? - Yes. What's the matter? We are sorry to trouble you. It's about your daughter. Unfortunately, my daughter is in Warsaw for the night. - She'll be back tomorrow. - It's about Maja. - This must be some kind of mistake. - We only want to help. - I am sorry, I must... - She was kidnapped, right? I wanted to show you this picture. The police have found this girl. Could this be your granddaughter? I don't understand. If this is your granddaughter, it would mean that your daughter could still be alive. Ms. Helena? - So, should we go? - Let's wait a minute, okay? The DNA tests have confirmed that you two are related. Looks just like Maja. Hi... I am your grandma. What? Don't you want to talk to your grandma? Maybe you'd like to tell her what happened? - Please, let us work! - What's your name? Please, tell me. - Elias. - Elias? Who is Elias? I found something! - Got it? - Yes! Bring in the technicians and seal off the perimeter. Hi. I love you. The girl said the word "Elias." - Elias? Don't know the guy. - Elias is a saint from Tishbe. - My wife says he was a saint. - Hello, Tomek's wife! Okay, so, the girl, the blood, a knife. Whose blood? Did the police find a corpse? No, I don't know. Even if they did, I doubt Michał would tell me anything about it. I know someone who will tell us. He is a bit strange. You will see for yourself anyway. I have to go! Are you still listening in to police frequencies? Have they found a body, recently? Everything okay? 01 to 012, over. - 01 speaking. What's up? - We have a body. Okay, I have it. So, the dead guy's name is Jarosław Szostak. The interesting thing is that he had an old ID on him. You know, the booklet kind. They were discontinued in 2001. Precisely. My radio is telling me that Szostak is a weatherman. A star of the local radio station in Tomaszow Mazowiecki. In 1997, he was suspected of molesting a child. Questioned several times but never charged. When Maja... Maja, right? Yes. When Maja went missing the police wanted to talk to Szostak again, only to discover he had vanished into thin air. No one knew his whereabouts until his body was found. That doesn't give us much. Who is Elias? Is that a pseudonym? - And where is Maja Barska? - And who killed Szostak? You're not suggesting it was the little girl? Calm down, easy. I cannot answer all of your questions! Just most of them. However, miracles take a while to come true. So keep your fingers crossed. Thanks, man! The judge will rule tomorrow. Barska will probably be able to take her granddaughter home. The wounds on Szostak's body. Not only did they perforate him, they also crushed his ribs. - Any other traces? - Nothing. He vanished from the face of the earth. The only notice in our system says that three years ago, an ophthalmologist in a village called Zagiel had a patient with that name. So we have to interrogate the ophthalmologist. He died a year ago. Dead or alive, we must interrogate. RELEASED PRISONER KILLS? That's not it. THE CASE OF JAROSŁAW SZ. Sylwia H.? Sylwia? Hey! We've been digging through the archives for a billion hours now. These articles are out of this world! So have I. "Detective" magazine. Year 2001. People love murders, kidnappings, good lord. Is it about the witness withdrawing her testimony in Szostak's case? No. It's about Sylwia H. being a witness. She was Szostak's girlfriend back then. - Sylwia H? Isn't she that politics woman? - The journalist, Sylwia Hardej? The witness to the prosecution withdrew her statement. But to the public Szostak remained a pedophile. It is not surprising that he disappeared in 2001. Maybe that Sylwia Hardej knows what he has been up to since then? And maybe she'll be able to tell us more about Maja Barska. Maja must have lived for at least another, what, eight years? To give birth to a baby girl. Ms. Sylwia, can we ask you for an autograph? Please. It would mean a lot. God, where did you get that? It's so old. Don't come up here. Your style has always been a huge inspiration to us. Where did you even find that? You can find everything on the net. Can we have the autograph, please? All right, thanks. You want an autograph? For Muffinka. Double F! Thank you so much. Ms. Sylwia, we would like to ask you to record a short video with us. - For our YouTube channel. - It'll only take a minute. - Franek, do we have time? - Yes, we do. - Hurry up. In a moment we start. - Yes, yes! Can I ask you to scoot, please? Thank you! Okay, action. Hi guys! Welcome to my channel. Look who's here with me today! Sylwia Hardej! A big hello to all of the viewers. Especially those who also watch my show, Politics Made Personal. You started out in a small radio station. Where was it, again? In Tomaszow. Those were good times. Right, is that were you lived out your fascinating relationship with, Jarosław Szostak? Turn it off. Turn it off! Turn it off! What the fuck are you doing? You wouldn't have wanted to talk to us otherwise. - You're right about that. - Szostak is dead. We have to start. Places, everyone. Last touchups. Thank you, ladies. Let's go. Sylwia, look at camera number 3. When the molestation case started and he was charged... Jarek completely shut everybody out. He wouldn't talk to anybody. He tried to kill himself. It was horrible. He was talking about absolution, about changing his life. That was when he met that man. Jarek thought only he could help him. Do you remember his name? That was twenty years ago. He had a strange name... Elias? You know... it's a little strange that after all these years in the police you would vomit looking at a dead body. Hello. We spoke on the phone today. Hello. Let me open up for you. These kind people have just arrived. Hello. Come on in. We only have a couple of questions. This way. Please. We don't want to disturb you. I see you are about to have lunch. You're at work, this is a normal situation. Do you recognize this person? No. And you? - What about him? - No. They were never our guests. I remember them all. Perhaps you would like to eat with us? - No, thank you. - Enjoy your meal. Goodbye. After Szostak disappeared, Sylwia hired a private detective. Did the detective find anything? Has he made himself useful? He got as far as the village of Zagiel. He didn't find anything. Locals say they have never heard of an Elias. So the trail that detective was following ends in Zagiel. - It did for him but not for us. - Where did you get this picture? People take pictures and pin them on a map. Look at this. Agro-tourism farm, "Willow." Can you see that? Regina? Wasn't the girl with the knife wearing the very same kind of clothes? - Exactly the same. - Is this a cult or something? They look like the Amish. Or something out of Dr. Quinn. - Okay, let's act. - Wait! Hold on! What the hell, man? You scared me. Sorry. Didn't you see that calf over there? You could have run it over. What are you doing here? I want to see Elias. This must be some mistake. I know he's here. In that case, follow me. Wait here. Maja Barska? Yes? Your daughter is with her grandmother. Your mother. She is safe. Untie me. Maja... - please, do you hear me? - Maja? Maja? Come. Dear child. - How do you know my name? - What is this? A brothel in the middle of the woods? Huh? Do choose your words carefully. They are only worth as much as the person saying them. I know why you are here. You found a child. It belongs to me. You have a lot of fear and chaos inside of you. You don't say? Do you know what your biggest fear is? No. Do enlighten me. That nobody will hear you. And you try to overcome that fear by being too loud to ignore. Somebody must have really hurt you. They must have failed to hear your suffering. You are like an open book. Like a child's drawing. You know, at least I have my own fear and I don't need anybody else's. You have two choices. The first one, and this is your best option... give me a chance. And yourself. No, thanks. What's the other choice? Free yourself. And listen. Only this way can you help yourself. I'm gonna puke. Let me out of here, you psycho. Let me out of here, psycho. Do you hear me? Let me out. Fucking let me out of here! Do you hear what I'm saying? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go... let me go! Calm down. Calm down, now. Everything okay? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Water? - Yes? - Hello? Serafin calling, Ola's mom. She didn't come home last night. She went to that village... - Zagiel. - Zagiel. - By herself? - We opened her laptop. It has a program that was able to locate her phone. I think you should go there immediately. All right, I'm going to drive there. Later. - What are you doing here? - Mushroom-picking. Go home. Not a chance. Ola is there, somewhere. I am going in with you. Out of the question. Even I can't go in. I don't have a warrant. Go back home. Fine, I'm going home. I can still see you. - It's you. - I'm so sorry to bother you. Not at all. Everyone is always welcome here. Can we help you? I'm working on the case of that little girl that we had shown you. Still? Unfortunately. I would like to ask you a couple of questions. - It won't take long. - But... what is going on? We are looking for her mother. - Is there something wrong? - No. Nothing. Everyone is always very welcome here. We will always help you if we can. Don't move. Stay here. Don't move! - Don't move. Stay here! - Lower your firearm! - Calm down. Easy! - I said put the gun away! I will. See? I'm putting it away. No gun. - Girls! - I don't have a gun. - Leave. Go away. - Calm down. - Let us be. Let us live! - Easy now. Let's talk. - Freeze! I said stop! - Sir, sir! - No. Stay there. - Don't listen to him. Go back inside. Take the girls inside. - Put the gun away. - Leave, or I'll shoot. Maja? Maja, go back into the house! Maja, you can't go in there! Calm down, let's talk. Maja! Maja! Stay put. You can't go in there. - Lower the rifle. - Maja, you can't go in there! Put the gun away. Stop! Stay still! Don't move. Don't move. Are you okay? Did he hurt you? Elias caught Maja when she was trying to escape. He killed Szostak with a knife and took her back to the farm. The little girl managed to run away with Szostak, who bled to death, unfortunately. The child was scared. She pulled the knife out of his body and took it for protection. Szostak was behind this escape, he organized everything. - He was a good guy. - What about Elias? That's a real nightmare. Elias was kidnapping girls. Some of them were born on the farm. He "married" them as soon as they were nine. You get high off doing this, don't you? It's not about that. It's just that some people have their Elias, while others have Ultraviolet. You do realize you could have died? I do. I can't lose you. Who will carry the shopping bags to the car for me? But disabled parking is always very close to the exit! It's good to have you here again. Maybe Kamil did one thing right after all. Give me a little push. Go to sleep. Subtitle translation by Piotr Daranowski
