 Good morning, Sergeant.
 Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?
 I've got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,
 and extra uniforms for the guards.
 Let him go. He's been checked.
 Continue. Continue, Paisa.
 Thank you, Sergeant.
 - Good day.
- Good day.
 - Good day, Paisa.
- Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.
 Escobar's prison was called La Catedral,
 but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín."
 It was the embodiment of "the big lie."
 It was even built
to look old and shitty on the outside.
 But inside, it was anything but.
 The other inmates?
Escobar's sicarios.
 Hand-picked killers from his hometown.
 You're here, my friend!
 - How you doing, Velasco?
- Good, brother. How was the trip?
 Fine, fine.
What a long drive!
 - Really?
- It's really hot.
 Did you encounter any problems?
 Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.
 I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.
 - What's going on, buddy?
- Blackie!
 - I thought you forgot about us.
- Let me show you.
 Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!
 The sicarios weren't the only guys
in the prison who worked for Escobar.
 The guards did, too.
 - Welcome to La Catedral.
- Hello.
 - Come on down, ladies.
 We'll take care of you.
 By the terms of his deal,
 no cops or military were allowed
within two miles of the prison.
 As much as I fucking hated this guy,
I had to hand it to him...
 he had a pretty sweet deal.
 Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?
 - That looks delicious, Paisa.
- All right, lobsters.
 Escobar hadn't
built himself a prison at all.
 He'd built himself a fortress.
 But no matter how you decorate it...
a cage is still a cage.
 Excuse me, boss.
 I've got a report.
 Moncada and Galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos
 through Mexico and the Caribbean.
 Did they pay the war tax?
 Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,
 a lot of other people
have been complaining.
 My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.
 Understood.
 Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.
 Mm.
 As am I.
 We're going to negotiate a truce.
 But first,
we're going to kill a few of his men.
 I'm sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,
 don't you think?
 The purpose of war...
 is peace.
 If there was one benefit
to Escobar's imprisonment,
 it's that peace
had finally come to Bogotá.
 Connie and I took advantage
and began adoption proceedings.
 The war had left many orphans.
 One... we could do something about.
 Oh, you like the pink ones,
don't you? Yeah, you do.
 Oh, orchids, look!
 What's this one? "Cattleya."
 It means "graceful." Hm.
 - That describes me perfectly.
 Oh, buying baby things
and plants for the apartment...
 we're a family.
 We're domesticated animals.
 - You want this one?
- Yeah.
 - You want that one? Yeah.
 How about Elizabeth?
 After my mother?
Are you kidding?
 What is "Elizabeth" in Spanish?
Is it "Isabel"? Isabel's nice.
 - I've always liked "Olivia."
- Olivia's OK.
 Fuck.
 - Shit!
 - What's the deal?
- Steve...
 Look what you've done to my car.
 - Where?
- Look at this traffic jam.
 - Look what you did to my car!
- Ah! It's nothing.
 - How am I gonna drive this?
- It's nothing.
 Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.
 Yeah, man!
 And you don't even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.
 - Don't mess with me, asshole.
- Easy, man.
 Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?
 I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that's it, then.
 What, are you gonna hit me?
You and who else?
 Oh, my...
 OK, take it easy.
It's all right. It's OK now.
 - Calm down, asshole.
- OK?
 - Relax, man. OK.
- OK?
 OK, calm down.
 Have some tolerance.
 Yeah, I like "Olivia."
 - Do you hear that?
- What?
 People. Children. Laughter.
 Even the vendors are back out.
 And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison.
 You did the right thing.
 You think?
 You should be happy.
 Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.
 Finally... we are at peace.
 We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.
 Ten of my men have just been killed.
 Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?
 Two things, Pacho.
 First... Mr. Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.
 And the second thing...
this is war, Pacho.
 There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.
 We are willing
to pay three million dollars
 - to settle the dispute in Los Angeles.
 Pablo won't accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.
 Twelve million is nothing to you.
 Do you want to know something?
 It's over.
 What's over?
 - The Medellín cartel.
 No, you're wrong, Pacho.
 We export twice the amount you do.
 You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?
 Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.
 That's how he treats
his friends and associates?
 Don't forget that, thanks to
Mr. Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,
 extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn't it?
 He was the one
who got us into this mess.
 Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.
 He started this fucking war.
 Are we going to negotiate or not?
 As part of Escobar's
surrender deal, Search Bloc was disbanded,
 and Colonel Carrillo
was transferred out of the country.
 For the time being,
Carrillo's war was over.
 I don't see why
they're sending you to Spain.
 It's not like the cocaine war is over.
 Galeano and Moncada
are fronting for Escobar.
 My superiors say I play too rough.
 At least Escobar is in jail and... you can
leave knowing you helped put him there.
 Jail?
 I know you gringos
aren't allowed to do flyovers, but um...
 I got some photographs,
courtesy of the Colombian military.
 I want you to look at 'em,
tell me if this qualifies as a jail.
 He's got a fucking soccer field.
 Escobar is moving more coke than ever.
 Without the Colombian government
breathing down his neck,
 all he's gotta worry about
is the Cali cartel.
 Let's face it, fellas...
 he won.
 We're here, gentlemen!
 - Gentlemen!
- What a bumpy ride, Paisa.
 Where did you learn to drive?
 We closed the deal at ten million dollars.
 This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.
 Sounds like a good proposition.
 Do you know what this means, boss?
 We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won't be the wiser.
 That way, we can... double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.
 How did he behave...
 when he offered you the money?
 What do you mean,
"how did he behave"?
 What was his attitude?
 Well... he was respectful, Pablo.
 Respectful in what way?
 - He wants peace, just like us.
- Yes, but...
 how did he react
when you told him our solution?
 In a positive manner.
 He just offered you the money,
just like that?
 Well... he started
at three million dollars. Right?
 - Mm.
- But we said no,
 and told him
you wouldn't take less than 12.
 So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.
 Offered you three million?
 He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn't accept that.
 If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.
 That's right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.
 Tell him I'm not happy
with less than 30.
 The Cali cartel won't accept that, Pablo.
 Thirty million...
if Cali wants peace.
 Very good.
 I also need to raise the war tax.
 From now on,
a million a month,
 for both of you...
and all our other partners.
 Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.
 If we get proof that Escobar
is violating the terms of his surrender,
 then they have to send him
to a real prison,
 but we need more
than these aerial shots.
 Can you get us satellite communications
or wire intercepts?
 There's a no-fly zone over the prison,
with antiaircraft guns
 manned by the Colombian army
to enforce it.
 You're playing with fire
if Noonan finds out.
 We don't got shit on him
without intercepts.
 - Don't need 'em.
- What? The hell we don't.
 They're not using phones.
 - The hell is that?
- I could spot a coop a mile away.
 That's how they're sending messages.
 To avoid our high-tech spy planes,
 Pablo chose the most
low-tech form of communication.
 Never said the guy wasn't crafty.
 - You see anything yet?
- No, man.
 You're blind as a bat.
Give me those.
 - Oh, one's goin'.
 - Ten o'clock. Comin' in low.
- I got it.
 - You got it?
- Yeah.
 Low.
 Ah...
 That's a fast fucking pigeon.
 Give me the gun.
 - You trying to say I'm a lousy shot?
- Yes, I am saying you're a lousy shot.
 Here.
 You're a shit shot.
 - Heads up, heads up.
- I got it.
 - One o'clock.
- I got it.
 Shoot.
 Shoot!
 Ever been duck huntin'?
 No, I have not been duck hunting,
you... fucking hillbilly.
 - Bingo.
 It's in Spanish. Read it.
 "Delivery due
with El Paisa in the tunnel."
 The son of a bitch
built a tunnel under the jail.
 We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.
 - Mm-hm?
- Mm-hm.
 We agreed to...
 - one million dollars.
- What?
 Right.
 What about the house in Cartagena?
 That's not happening, right?
 Do you want your house in Cartagena?
 - Of course.
- OK... you will have it.
 Don't you see
things are improving?
 No, I see things
are getting more complicated.
 Instead of getting better...
things are getting worse.
 Mm-hm.
 Pablo doesn't want peace with Cali.
 Now, what about this war tax
he's charging you?
 $250,000 was a lot of money.
 And now a million?
Ridiculous.
 What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won't pay it?
 - Obviously not.
- Then I don't understand.
 - What do you want me to do?
- It's not right, Kiko, and you know it.
 Look, I... adore Pablo.
I adore him.
 But the thing is, I don't know
what's going on with him these days.
 I don't know.
Maybe he's depressed.
 We're here in a Jacuzzi...
 free.
 - Do you love me?
- Oh...
 Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.
 Against orders, we did
high-altitude flyovers of the prison
 - with our infrared cameras.
- No tunnels.
 Tomography report indicates nothing.
Seismic measuring, nada.
 Can we measure radio frequency energy?
 Well, we could try.
Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.
 If he's bringing shit into this tunnel,
you can bet he's going out that way.
 If there's a tunnel there,
he must have dug it to China.
 Good luck.
 Maybe we can...
 We can ask the military
to do light detection and ranging.
 We got a better chance of Noonan
authorizing a divining rod.
 - All right, man, I'm calling it a night.
- Nah, finish up.
 No, you can't even smoke in here.
 No luck?
 These aerials don't indicate
a single tunnel in the whole mountainside.
 Hm.
 Well, the only thing I can see
in all of them is this truck.
 - Are you finished with that, honey?
- Yeah.
 What happened?
 Did it stop?
 Good morning.
 - What's up?
- Are you "The Paisa"?
 - Yes.
- Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.
 Do me a favor
and get out of the truck.
 - What's going on?
- Don't be afraid.
 Up against the truck.
 Let's go.
 Do me another favor.
 Open it up.
 Go on.
 We missed a very important delivery.
 Sex toys, back issues of Hustler,
a waterbed, a legal correspondence course.
 He's bored shitless in there.
 Look, gringos...
you don't have the right to do this.
 Of course we have the right.
 You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?
 If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he'll kill me.
 What did he say?
 He says if Pablo finds out,
he'll kill him.
 Amigo...
 Pablo's your boss?
 Yeah? Yeah.
 I am your boss. Yes?
 It's OK, it's OK!
I'll do whatever you say.
 Yeah?
 Are you OK, friend?
 Good day.
 So what is this?
What am I looking at exactly?
 - Club Medellín.
- This was all shipped in to La Catedral.
 We got some big-screen TVs,
nice stereo equipment.
 That's a roulette wheel,
a little bit of liquor.
 Glad to see the judges could come down
with the official from the airport.
 Javi's pretty keen on this Jacuzzi.
 Don't forget the jukebox
with the hookers.
 Of course, the lobster.
 - This is a--
- Yes, it's a roulette wheel.
 He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.
 - Where did you get these pictures?
- From the DEA.
 Of course.
 It's not just these pictures.
 They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,
 other narcos, prostitutes...
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.
 - Who else has seen these?
- No one, as far as I know.
 - That's why we have to act now.
 Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?
 The DEA is capable of anything.
That's why we have to do something now.
 At one time, Escobar...
used to own all of Colombia.
 Now he's just the owner
of his own prison.
 If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral...
 or bombings in the country...
 I would be eternally grateful
to these women.
 Happy birthday, Pablo!
 - Watch your step.
- Careful with the little girl!
 How are you? Welcome.
 - Happy birthday.
- Hello, sweetheart.
 They're the ones I hired?
I don't believe you.
 They are really good, Blackie.
I like them.
 Come on, Pablo, tell us...
what are you doing these days? Hm!
 - How do you spend your time?
- Aside from missing his family?
 Oh! Of course.
 - He's writing a book.
- Mm!
 - Mother.
- What?
 Isn't it true?
You are writing a book.
 Please, Mom.
 Well, then, you tell them.
 - It's a collection of magazine articles.
- Many articles.
 - Clippings. It's a book of cartoons.
- Oh, cartoons!
 From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.
 And you know what?
People write him every day.
 - It's because they love him.
- I can imagine.
 You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.
 Yes, my love. And you have Judy's husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.
 Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you
 for all the responsibilities
you have given him.
 Thank you very much.
 - We were in Cartagena--
- Where?
 - We were in Cartagena last week.
- Oh, yeah?
 Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.
 It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.
 - How nice.
- Wonderful, Tata. You can't imagine.
 But I'll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.
 Oh, it's unaffordable.
 Besides, this whole "war with Cali" thing,
 it's tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.
 We understand it's not easy,
but there's not much we can do.
 It's OK.
 Kiko complained about that?
 He mentioned it.
 He didn't complain, Pablo,
he didn't complain.
 Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you're making,
 for God's sake.
So I think it's normal, right?
 It's normal that
we'd give you our support.
 Well, I think it's normal...
I really do.
 Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?
 Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.
 Leave the gift here.
 I'll look after it.
 The word from Sandoval is, Gaviria isn't
gonna do shit about Escobar's violations.
 Carrillo was right. He won.
 What are those?
 These are a list of, uh...
my accomplishments.
 You shred these.
 Apologize!
 Apologize!
 Apologize!
 - Were you watching?
- Yes.
 You apologize!
 I'm sorry, boss.
 I didn't mean it.
 - Relax.
- Are you all right, boss?
 Relax. That's how the game goes.
 Go on, go on.
You guys continue.
 Are you all right, sir?
 Boss.
 Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.
 Everything OK?
 - Boss, we have a problem.
- What problem?
 You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment
 - that was seized in Boyacá?
- Yes.
 - 250 kilos.
- Exactly.
 Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?
 Do you know where that was, boss?
 In Rionegro.
 True story. And pay attention,
because it changes a lot of lives.
 Remember how I told you that
the cartel was making so much money
 that they had to bury it?
 And Blackbeard had the treasure map.
 Well, after we got him,
he gave a lot of it up...
 but not all of it.
 It just so happens that one day,
out in a field in Rionegro,
 a farmer who worked
for Galeano and Moncada found one.
 At first, the poor guy
thought he'd dug up a body.
 Over the years, plenty of 'em
had been buried out in the fields.
 The farmer knew right away
it was narco money.
 He was terrified he might
get buried himself if he took it.
 So he took the money
to a guy who was connected,
 who took it to another guy...
 who took it to Pablo's
sicario lieutenant... Velasco.
 There's cash buried everywhere.
 The guerillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos...
 - Everybody's burying cash.
- Yes, I know.
 But right on Moncada
and Galeano's property?
 Don't you think that's strange, boss?
 I think it's strange.
 Look. All this cash...
 was found... in a field.
 - That's good luck, Pablo.
 Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.
 It was on your property,
in Rionegro.
 But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,
 and most of us rent out to the farmers.
 Mm.
 You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.
 That's true.
 The shipment equaled that amount of cash.
 Who told you to open your mouth?
 Not true? Hm?
 Pablo, do you think
we're stealing from you?
 That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?
 If you'd like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.
 Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?
 Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.
 I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.
 Gustavo...
would never forget where he buried cash.
 Who's putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?
 These fuckers
would sell their own mother.
 - We are partners and friends.
- Mm.
 Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?
 Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.
 That's a lie.
 - Because you complained to your wife.
- I haven't complained.
 You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.
 I understand
this is difficult for you, Pablo--
 What is difficult for me?
 Well, managing all of this.
That's why you hired us.
 - So we can manage it and look after it.
- Mm.
 You trust us, right?
 I understand this makes you anxious--
 - Do I look anxious?
- No, I didn't mean that.
 - You said with certainty that--
- No, no, what I meant to say was--
 - I think you're the one who's anxious.
- We didn't do shit, Pablo!
 With that tone of yours...
you're telling me you didn't do shit?
 Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not?!
 No, Pablo.
 Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not?!
 For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.
 - It's the truth, you pair of liars.
- Of course, he--
 - Shut up, motherfucker!
- You're petty thieves!
 You shut up, motherfucker!
Don't you disrespect me!
 Pablo, look at me, man.
 We're family.
 You're my daughter's godfather.
 And also godfather to Galeano's kids.
 What's going on?
 We're like brothers.
 We're partners and friends.
 We've been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.
 We made our first trip to Miami together.
 We made so much cash together that
we don't even know what we spent it on.
 What's the problem?
 What's happening?
 The two of us love you very much.
 And we're very grateful.
 All right.
 Being stuck in here...
 can make someone paranoid.
 - Paisa! Paisa!
 Well, man,
these things happen, right?
 We're here for whatever you need.
Trust us.
 I'm going to make a trip to Miami.
 I'll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?
 Don Pablo.
 Pablo, don't do it! Pablo, no!
 You're a dog,
you son of a bitch!
 What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?
 You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?
 At the end of the day, you'll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.
 Goodbye, Kiko.
 Kill me if you're such a man,
motherfucker.
 Kill me with your own fucking hands!
 Who are you talking to, asshole?
 Motherfucker!
 Wait a second!
 Be careful, man.
 Look what the dead guy gave me.
 What the fuck!
You're going to burn all the meat!
 What is wrong with you? Can't you see
I'm doing it to cover the smell?
 - Yeah, but let's not burn it all.
- What are we gonna do with all this meat?
 - What are you going to do?
- What am I supposed to do?
 What?
 Boss, are you OK?
 Do you need anything, boss?
 We're grilling some meat.
Do you want some?
 No. I'm not hungry.
 Navegante.
 Boss.
 - Do you want me to wax it?
- No, relax.
 This one's my favorite.
I enjoy it.
 This is a beautiful car.
 Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?
 Looks like the rumors are true, boss.
 It's a shame.
 I warned them.
 As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.
 Do you still have that DEA contact?
 Javier Peña? Of course.
 I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumors.
 They're just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.
 I haven't heard from him since yesterday.
 I've called everyone.
I'm so worried.
 Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.
 Just relax, sweetie.
 Your husband is fine.
 No. No, thank you.
 Maybe... they had to go
somewhere else urgently?
 Or maybe they left
without saying anything.
 The way our men usually do.
 Yes, but it's a little strange,
don't you think?
 Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.
 He said he would be home later.
 We're trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.
 No? We're trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,
 so we had a very important date to keep.
 Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?
 Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?
 I want my husband back.
 If Pablo told Tata that they left...
 it's because they left.
 Listen...
Pablo is your kids' godfather.
 He would never hurt them.
 Let's talk about Don Pablo Escobar.
 There are rumors that
he killed Galeano and Moncada.
 Where, in jail?
 Yeah, yeah.
 "In jail."
 That doesn't make any sense.
They're partners.
 Maybe there is not such thing as sense
with Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria.
 Bullshit. Where'd you get it?
 The relatives of the men he killed...
are up in arms.
 The poor fellows went in,
but they never got out.
 I want to ask you gentlemen
a serious question now.
 How bad do you want Escobar?
 How far are you willing to go
in this matter?
 What are you proposing?
 Well, we both have access to information
that could benefit the other.
 No.
 No, we don't trade information.
 - Just hold on a second.
- No.
 He's an informant, Javi.
 Whatever you got cookin', it stinks.
I don't want it.
 Appreciate the tip. Let's go.
 Your partner here...
 may need some convincing now.
 Moncada and Galeano going
into La Catedral, last stamped 9:20.
 Every return from this day forward...
 no Moncada, no Galeano.
 Personally, we couldn't have cared
less about a couple of dead narcos.
 It meant more chaos and confusion
in the Medellín cartel.
 But we wanted Escobar out of that
piece of shit excuse for a jail,
 in a real prison, not a fortress...
 where his enemies could get payback.
 You sure?
 We can either play politics
or we can do the job.
 Well, we were never any good
at playing politics anyway.
 What do you think?
 These photos are worth looking into.
 And believe me, I'm going to.
 If it's true, this is
gonna cause a shit storm, you know?
 - Be right back.
- Gracias.
 Well...
 Fuck President Gaviria.
 Fuck Noonan.
 Fuck La Catedral.
 And fuck Pablo.
