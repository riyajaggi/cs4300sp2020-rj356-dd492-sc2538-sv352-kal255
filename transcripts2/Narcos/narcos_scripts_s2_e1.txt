 Hey, Jimenez... Do you think the Special Forces guys killed him'? If he can even be killed, that is. What do you mean? What are you talking about? I don't know. I heard they shot him 20 times. They pumped him full of lead. Then they burned his body and spread his ashes all over Medellin. They say that he rose from the ashes, and he went to the houses of each of the men who had shot him, and he killed them as they slept.

 Bullshit. Quiet! Someone's coming. We're soldiers from the National Army! Stop and identify yourselves! We're well armed! Mr. Escobar. I'm sorry, but we've been ordered to not let you through. We have to take you into custody. Son, I'm sorry to say... unfortunately, I can't allow that to happen. Excuse me. You don't speak a word of this to anyone, understood? This... is an enormous embarrassment for all of Colombia, gentlemen.

 So... -how will we proceed? - Mr. President... Mr. President, Escobar will surely attempt to reestablish himself within the city, and we can't allow him and his sicarios to move freely. So my recommendation, Mr. President, is that we occupy Medellin. Flood the streets with officers. Conduct searches. Close down the streets. Establish vehicle checkpoints. Pressure him until he appears, Mr. President. And who would conduct such an operation? Colonel Pinzén, sir. - He should begin immediately. - Of course, Mr. President. - Are you injured? - No, I'm not hurt. You know I couldn't talk to him. I couldn't negotiate with Escobar. - I understand. - Why did you go inside? I sensed something was off. Ariza said his orders were to secure the perimeter, that's all. Wait, he lied_ I gave the order myself. Go home and get some rest, but come back soon. You know you're the only person I can trust. Yes, sir. It's all right, Tata. I'll be right back. Excuse me, Dona Hermilda. Boss. - It's good to see you. - It's great to have you back home. Very good to see you. He's here. It's him. - Praise the Lord. I knew it. I knew it. - How are you, brother? Pablo! Thank God. - Oh, my son! - How are you'? - I'm all right. - You're all right? - How are you? - I'm all right. - You're all right? - I'm all right. - I did everything I could, Dad. - I know. I know. I am very proud. I love you very much. It's Dad. ...you and your family. May he always protect you in his holy glory. Thank you very much. You're great boys. - Monitor the police frequencies. - Yes. And don't bother me unless it's necessary. As you wish, boss. Very good. Very good, gentlemen. Very good. Please take the things out of the car and organize them over there. I felt I'd lost you. You're never going to lose me. And what now, Pablo? What will we do now? I did what I had to do, Tata. I'll take care of it. We'll be fine, and content, and happy, and together, and united. But-- Always. Always. - Tell me you'll never leave me. - Never. Promise. I promise. I promise, my love. Yes, I understand you're from the DEA, but I have to ask Colonel Pinzén first. Wait one moment. Gentlemen, wait here for a moment. We'll let you in once the area is secured, understood? We're going to have to move everything. - What do you mean by "everything"? - Everything. The labs... the offices, the hideouts, the deposits... we're moving everything. Boss, even the labs? They're well-guarded. There's no problem. Come on, don't you know what's going on at La Catedral? The cops are going through all of the maps and documents you idiots left behind. Now we can't trust anyone, you bastards. Who are you calling a bastard, you son of a bitch? We're... moving... everything. Right? - Yes, sir. Yes, Don Pablo. We're also going to need more men. Last night we lost a lot of brothers. - May they rest in peace. - Amen. And one last thing. I'm going to need a good driver with a clean record to drive me around the city. He needs to be smart, fearless, and loyal. - Done, boss. - Boss, I'm sorry, but you can't risk yourself like that. Yes, Don Pablo, I agree with Velasco. I want people to know that Pablo Escobar doesn't hide like a rat. Because we... are the Medellin cartel, motherfucker! Pablo, no! You believe whatever the fuck you want to believe, you son of a bitch! - This again? Stop obsessing. Relax. - Relax? What do you want me to do? Should I sit here and wait for Pablo to walk through that door and kill me and my daughter? He's going to come and kill you, too. - What do you think about that? - Pablo won't be killing anyone, all right? Jaime, what country do you live in? If he hasn't killed anyone yet, he's planning on it. Haven't you noticed, Berna? Judy, haven't you noticed? Gaviria's got this city swarming with cops. There's a cop on every fucking street corner. Pablo can't move. Then we have to find and kill the bastard before the police find him. Judy, listen. Listen to me! Listen! Pablo, right now, it's like he's like a caged rat. Understand? Jaime. Despite everything, you still don't know what Pablo`s capable of'? - He's someone we can't underestimate. - You said it, Berna. They shouldn't underestimate us either. And Pablo's got very few friends left, and you know it. Pablo will always have friends. Berna, I want everyone to know what happened to Kiko. It should be clear that being loyal to Escobar will only earn you a bullet in the head. They'll know what side they should be on, right? Judy... what do we do with the labs? What do you suggest? I think we shut down the labs, at least for a while. We have to lay low until Pablo is killed or captured. That's stupid, Berna. Tell me how that makes any sense. A lot of other people also stopped paying Pablo at the same time as us. Let's join forces with them. There's the Priscos, for example. Last night I met with Ricardo. I'll talk to him. Jaime, be very careful with those people. - Hello? - Okay? - That looks nice. - One moment. Ricardo? Don Pablo. Of course. There was no decision to make. You know that you can always count on us. Sweetie! Hey! Fag! What's going on, Limon? - Son of a bitch. - How's it going, brother? Good or what? Quica, my love, come give me the best 20 minutes of my life. What are you doing here? Are you going in? No, brother. I didn't come to see the whores. - Then what? - I came to see you, brother. And from what I can see, you're still driving whores everywhere. You know how it is. I have to pay rent. Listen, Limon, don't you want to make good money'? Doing what? - The same thing, brother. - Driving who? Pablo Escobar, brother. - Eat shit, you son of a bitch. - Limon, I'm serious, brother. The boss asked us to find someone... someone clean, who the police don't know. He would go in the trunk. - Where would I have to take him? - Wherever he wants to go. You don't ask. What do you think, brother? There's cops everywhere. Why don't we put a girl in the back so no one gets suspicious? - Which one of the whores do you trust? - They're whores, brother. Then who, brother? “No! Mo? - Thank you. - Why not, Maritza? - No. - What's wrong with it? Nothing. - I'm very busy, Jhon. - That doesn't matter, Maritza. Yes? Ask one of the girls you drive around all day. - I can't. - Get out of my way. Maritza... I need you to do it. It'll be the easiest money you'll make in your life. You can quit your second job, understand? You'll be able to take care of your daughter. Haven't I always done right by you? I've always helped you and your family, right? So? Right? You're a son of a bitch, you know? So what? - And who's that? - He's a friend. He's trustworthy. What's up, Quica? This is the girl I told you about. Let's go. Take care, skinny! - All good? - All good, brother. I'll follow you, brother. - Who's that bitch? - Close your fucking legs, Rosa. You’ll kill all the flowers. You shit-eating bastard. This pussy smells great. Now you're going to the market to buy your whores, you bastard? Don't get Piss!!- If you're in a better mood when I come back this afternoon, you'll get to fuck me. Fucking Quica. Shut up! Go inside! Watch yourself! Ready? Close your eyes. That's right. It's a little bunny, my love. She's very delicate. Boss? Look, Don Pablo... this is the guy I've been telling you about, Limon. He's Guarazapo`s cousin. Limon! Come here, brother. Come on! It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. Don't worry, boss. We've known each other for a long time. Besides, he's never had any run-ins with police. He's clean. And where are you from, son? I was born in Envigado, sir. My mother lives in the barrio you built for us. I'm very glad. - What about the girl? - She... She's a friend, boss. We went to school together in Envigado. I know her very well and I know where she works, so she's someone we can trust, boss. Listen, Limon... Do you know what it means to work for me? Ifs an honor to work for you, Don Pablo. You've done so much for the poor in Medellin... if I have to lose my life for you... I will, boss. All right. Open the trunk. Don't worry, brother. Everything's good. All yours. Where are we? - What the fuck are we doing here, Jhon? - Get down and hide. - Jhon, I don't-- - Shit, Maritza, I don't have time to give you explanations. Just do it, all right? Don Pablo. - Hello. - Welcome. Thank you. No, don't get up. Don't get up. - How are you? - Very well. Great, I'm very glad. - Rojas. - Don Pablo. - Sir. - How have you been? Well, sir. How are you? I wasn't expecting you. - I'm well. Very well. - Guys, please. Yes, sir. - Don Pablo. - Do you want anything to drink, sir? - A coffee? - No, thank you. - Can I get you anything? - Thank you, I'm fine. - How are you? - I'm well, sir. Everything is well. - How is Maribel? - Maribel is well, sir. Thank you. Good, brother. What's going on with the deposits? They're looking a little light. Well, after everything that happened with... with Mr. Galeano and Mr. Moncada, well... people are nervous, you understand? This woman, Judy Moncada, has been talking to people. Not everyone wants to pay. - So that's it? - That's it, sir. I thought you knew. - I told them to tell you-- - Calm down. Don't worry about that. We'll fix that problem soon. Yes, sir. In the meantime... I want you to move to the offices in Laureles. Ifs no longer safe here. - Done, sir. Whatever you say. - Good. And fill this up, please. Don Pablo! - Sir, how are-- - Is that you? - How are you, sir? - Sweetie! Sweetie! Sweetie! Don Pablo is in front of our house. Don Pablo? - Don Pablo! - Hello Ma'am. How are you? - Fine, and you? - I'm well. - It's him, old man. - Sir, how are you? - How is your health? - It's good. Very good! Good. Good. How are all of you? Good? Good? - How are you, Don Pablo? - Good. It's him. In the flesh? - Good? - Boss, we should get going. Let them see me. Let them see me. I never thought I'd meet you in person. I'm well, Ma'am, how are you? - Here, boss, behind you. - Here. Let's see. - Generous as always, Don Pablo. - For you. - Thank you, Don Pablo. - For the doctor, sir. For the doctor. - Thank you, Don Pablo. - Take care of yourself. For you, Ma'am. For you too, sir. There's a girl on line three. She wants to talk to an American. - What's wrong, brother? - Suck my dick, please. - DEA Agent Pena. - Pay attention. I know where you can find one of Escobar's men. Oh, yeah? Which one? There's a reward, right? Yes, there's a reward. What's your information, miss? Who are you talking about? La Quica. La Quica? You know La Quica? He came to the brothel on 23rd street. He left with a man in a taxi and said he would return later. Do you work there? Yes. How long ago was this? A couple of hours ago. All right, we'll look into it. It would be worth investigating, Colonel. We're not asking for a lot. Did you close the lab? Jesus Christ. No, Berna, and I won't because it's not necessary. - Listen to me, Jaime-- - No, you listen to me. Enough of this. I already spoke with Ricardo Prisco, all right? He's with us. He supports us. Everything is firm. Everything is good. What more could we want? I told you to be careful with those people, Jaime. Pay attention to me. First, these guys have been with us since Pablo killed Kiko, right? Second, Ricardo knows that being loyal to Pablo means a bullet in the head, brother. And third, and to ease your mind, they're sending us men, for security-- What? So you gave these people the address to the lab? Don't be an idiot. How else would they get here? Jaime, listen to me. Get out of there now. Get moving and come here right now! Listen to me, Berna! Stop with the paranoia, brother! Jaime! Jaime! Get out now! - Come here now! - Come play, motherfuckers! Jaime! Jaime! Get out now! What's going on, Ricardo? You're fucking up, man. Ricardo, put the gun down, brother. Ricardo, put it down. Pablo is weak right now, brother. You know this. The city's filled with cops. Pablo can't move, brother. Ricardo, put the gun down. Hello, Jaime. Jaime. - Berna, how have you been? - Who's this? This is Pablo speaking. I imagine you want to talk to Jaime, right? Berna, help me, man. Berna, talk to Pablo. Explain everything, Berna! Help me! Pablo, no! Wait! And now, you fat son of a bitch... we're coming after you and that bitch you protect. Pablo, you've just made the biggest mistake. Tell the others... Who is it? ...that Pablo Escobar is to be respected, you son of a bitch. That son of a bitch! His entire family, do you understand? I want everyone in his fucking family dead! That fat fuck! Son of a bitch! Listen, Judy... I'm very sorry about Jaime, and I'm very sorry about all of these deaths. We have to accept that we lost this time. But you know what? I'll be with you until the end. And if you want to go ahead on against Pablo, just say so. We'll find strong allies. And people. We'll need a lot of people. Yes. You're right. Yes. I think we have to see things for what they are. The truth of the matter, just as it is. And this is the truth, Berna: I know of someone who's very powerful. Someone who wants to kill Pablo as much as I do. - You sure it's not a trap? - I'm not sure of anything. Hello, Fernando. You did very well, sister. Look... you don't just get two, you get three. You have a special talent, and that's why you get three instead of two green ones. What are you doing tonight, sweetie? I know of a nice calm place. We could have fun. I can't. I have to take care of my daughter. - Bitch. Give me 30 minutes, Limon. - All right, brother. I'm going to fuck one of them. Sweetie... Thank you, Maritza. Bastard. Excuse me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Right here, to the right. It's the next right. Know the area well, don't you, Pena? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah? You like that? Yeah? There's the taxi. Park on the left. There. Calm down! Calm down! Okay, let's go. All right. Wait for me here. - Trujillo! - Go around! Go around! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Brother! God damn it. What? - Quica! Quica! - What's the problem, brother? Let's go, brother. Hurry up! Brother! Hurry, Quica! They're cops, brother! Run! Stop looking. This is the best place to eat. The situation is that... your escape has left us without... We don't have a lot of options. If I hadn't escaped, they would have killed me, Fernando. Or I'd rot in an American jail. - You will tell Gaviria-- - Gaviria is being crucified by the media. I don't think it's a good time. You will tell Gaviria... I am willing to go back to La Catedral to finish my sentence. As you wish. - Tomorrow morning, I'll return to Bogoté. - No, no, no, brother. We can't... leave for tomorrow what we can do today. Right? Mr. President, Mr. Fernando Duque is on the line. - I don't have anything to say to him. - I'll handle it. You go ahead. Mr. Duque. Eduardo Sandoval speaking. Mr. Vice Minister, I have an important message from Mr. Escobar. He says he's willing to negotiate the conditions for his return to La Catedral. Turn on the television. - What did he say? - He told us to turn on the television. Good evening, compatriots. In the last year and a half, we've enjoyed the peace we'd long awaited... for over a decade. Now we can go to work, drop our children off at school, and enjoy life's small pleasures... without the threat of violence looming around every corner. This peace is now threatened by virtue of Pablo Escobar's escape. Escobar has been named the bloodiest narcoterrorist of all time. This history... changes today. But I need your help. We must come together as a people, as a country, so his reign of term: comes to an end here and now. This is why I'm before you now... offering a reward of 1.4 million dollars for whoever gives information leading to his capture. It is my hope that through this reward... the day will finally come when our country is free of Pablo's grip... and will cease to be held hostage by terror, intimidation... and murder. I want to make it very clear... that under no circumstances... will I negotiate with Pablo Escobar.
