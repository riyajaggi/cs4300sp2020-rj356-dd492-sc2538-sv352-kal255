 Hung (2009–2011): Season 3, Episode 5 - We're Golden or Crooks and Big Beaver - full transcript 
 Ray is handcuffed in the back seat of Lydia's patrol car; it's unclear what her intentions are. She stops at a jiffy mart and Ray phones Tanya, pulling her from an embrace with Charlie. He advises her to let her ho go to jail, but she's determined to stop Lydia. Meanwhile, Ray and Jessica's daughter wants to move from Jessica's to Ray's because she objects to Jessica's behavior with her new boss. The childless Lydia, whose back story comes into play, insists that Ray give Jessica a hand - for three minutes - then it's back in the patrol car. Can Ray or Tanya figure out how to assuage Lydia's anger for being sent a substitute penis? What do women want?

Yeah, Lydia, listen. I-- I know maybe-- I think-- Tanya said that, you know, there was, I think, a big misunderstanding. Okay, I get that you're pretty sore at me. Maybe I didn't handle our situation the right way and you're upset. Is-- is this about me leaving the business? Because, you know, that's-- that's not a done deal. I mean Africa can wait, if that's what-- Ow. Fuck. Ow. Ow. You think I'm blind? What? What? - Think I'm retarded? - Lydia. I'm there thinking I'm gonna have sex with your penis and get another penis instead? Please say a command. Call Tanya Scagle. - Call Tabitha Kagen. - Scagle. Call-- call Tanya Scagle. Did you say, "Call Timothy Kilroy"? Call Tanya Scagle. - Dialing.  - ♪ Love love love love ♪ ♪ love is on your side ♪ ♪ love's on your side ♪ ♪ love... ♪ Ray, I've been calling you all night. Oh man, is that your ho? She arrested me, Tanya. Who? Lydia. Wait, where are you? Are you in jail? I'm at the Swifty Mart, you know, the one on Crooks and Big Beaver. Why Swifty Mart? Tanya, I need you to put your brain on, okay? I don't know. She stopped for cigarettes. Okay okay okay, did you try talking to her? Maybe she's just-- She won't talk to me. She's talking about a different penis. Last time I checked, I only got the one. Okay, you know what? I will take care of it. I will call her and reason with her. I will talk her off the cliff. You just-- you sit tight and you stay calm. Oh my-- Fuck. Oh my God. Jesus. - What? - Lydia, hi. What's up? Not much. That's cool. Are-- are you feeling a little stressed out lately maybe? Not really. Why? Um, I just felt uneasy about the way we left things. I-- I just thought maybe you-- you weren't completely satisfied. Oh no, just peachy. The conversation we had yesterday-- very helpful. In fact, I love the new guy you sent over without telling me. Lydia, you know what? In retrospect, it was-- it was probably the wrong thing for me to do to book you for our-- our surprise plan. So why don't we just meet and talk about it? I've got time. Do you have time right now? I could come to you. - Sounds good, Tanya. - Good. - Oh shoot, I'm getting another call. - No no no, don't-- No no no no no. Lydia, Lydia, Lydia, Lydia. I could-- Oh, fucking shit. Charlie, Charlie, sorry sorry sorry. I gotta-- You gotta-- Listen, I-I-I-I I will-- I will call you from the road. Yeah, crazy dude ho. - Hi. - Mom! Your boss is here again. Matt. Hi. Is something wrong? No no. But I was-- I felt a little awkwardness back there earlier. Maybe we rushed it a little, maybe not. You are a beautiful woman. We made love. I don't want you to feel like tomorrow at the office-- You be you. I'll be me. You know what I mean? Uh, I can be me. That's-- that's what I was planning on. Great. Yeah. Okay, is that what you came over to tell me? Yes. That's great. Okay. Oh, and by the way, your job-- perfectly intact. See you tomorrow. Come on, you don't listen to me. We've already established that. But this time I am really really listening, Charlie. I have no idea what to do. I will tell you what not to do: Do not chase after a damn cop who just arrested your ho. Cut him loose, t. Are you saying I should leave my ho in custody? He's going downtown. Do you want to join him? Now is not the time to be playing games. Lydia, listen. I cannot go to jail. I'm a father. I'm a-- I'm a teacher. I'm a girls' volleyball coach. Shh. Shut it. You see that guy over there? What guy? Top step, fat face, burly shoulders. You mean the policeman? Yeah. Does he look kind to you? Does he look like-- like Mr. Nice Guy? Uh, I-- yeah, he looks okay. He looks like an okay guy. Yeah? He's not okay. We're married three years tomorrow. You're married? You're married. That's great. What's so great about it? He's an angry, self-centered prick who likes to fuck 20-year-old prostitutes. - You want to meet him? - You mean, for dinner? Nope, right now. Might be fun. No, I don't. Lydia, it's not fun. You have a phone? Uh, yeah, I guess so. - Who's Jessica? - My ex-wife. Just don't-- don't answer it, please. You don't ignore your wife. No no no, it's my ex-wife. Hello, Jess. Hey, dad, things are really bad here. Damon, what's going on? I am not a criminal because I went on a date. Oh, it wasn't a date. It was more than a date. - Would you stop judging me? - It's gonna ruin everything. Maybe you should just get over here. This shit is really blowing up. Damester, I'm kind of in the middle of something. I can't live here anymore. It wasn't a date. - What did you do? - Nothing. Nothing. I didn't do anything. My kids are fighting with their mom and they want me to go over there. Where do they live? Jason, open the door. I know you're in there. Open the door. I can hear the television. You have to tell her. No? No? I'm gonna. - Sit. No. - No, I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. - Now listen, Lenore-- - Where is he? Where were you? You left a client waiting tonight. Where the hell were you? What happened to your face? I don't feel well, Lenore. It's not that big of a deal. Jason and I-- Sandee, just shut the hell up. Go feed the turtle. Tell me what? I went on another date. I do what I want to do. You are not the boss of him. The other girl set it up and she offered more money. And we are not sorry at all. You took a client from Tanya? It was like a referral. But this woman went kind of apeshit on me, like way rough. Let me see. - Ow! - Stop it. - What the fuck? - Oh, did that hurt? I'm sorry. You know what really hurts? Taking something fragile and breaking it, like someone's trust or this beautiful television. Oh my God. Did that hurt? - Answer me when I call you. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you, Lydia. Thank you. I'm-- really, for everything-- You've got five minutes. You try to run, I'll call an A.P.B. on your ass. Okay. - I'm close, Ray. - I'm very close. Where is she now? She's waiting at the curb. Did she calm down a little? Yeah, she's full of joy, Tanya. I gotta go. - Hey. - What are you doing here? Well, Damon called me and wanted me to stop by. Is that okay? Okay, father of the year, have at it. Whoa, somebody going on a trip? Yeah, like us. Let's go. - Where are your shoes? - Darb, what's going on? I'll tell you in the car. Let's go. Mom took the jeep key. She won't let us drive our own car. I am not gonna let you drive when you are irrational and upset. Darby is traumatized, mom. He is your boss. He's worse than Ronnie. He's gonna ruin everything. - He is my friend. - I heard what he said. You went on a date with that doctor guy? You-- you stick up for me. You stick up for me for once. Oh, I am sticking up for you. The doctor guy? You're just gonna marry him and then ditch dad again. Yeah, that's really independent-- wash, rinse and repeat. Darby, I am not going to do that. I do not do that. I learn from my mistakes. I-- I grow. I-- I get better. Okay, well, guys, I gotta-- All right, everybody huddle up. - What? - Come here, huddle up, guys. We don't want to huddle up. We want to move back in with you. Well, your mom is-- Look, from my side of things, things aren't always black and white, okay? Now put the bags down and give your dad a hug, all right? Maybe he needs one too. Come on, guys. Come on. We're on the same team here. We can't turn against each other. We're family. We've got to stick together. We're Dreckers. Not mom. She's a Haxon. Damon, cut it out. You love your mom. We love your mother. Okay, good talk. Glad we did this. Guys, everything's gonna blow over. Unpack the bags, all right? Be good to your mother. Love ya. Where were his shoes? My family needed me, and there I was, stuck with Rambo. What the hell was she gonna do with me? How did it go? I don't know. It was okay, I guess, for five minutes. How old are they? 17, twins. That's a tough age, huh? Yeah, tell me about it. You got kids? No. I mean, I wanted them. You know, I begged him all last year-- "Why don't we have kids? Why don't I get pregnant?" But he didn't want to.

Ray, about the two penises-- Don't. Just don't even go there, Tanya. I think I might know who the other penis is. What? The other penis. It was Jason. Yeah, well look, you weren't answering your phone. And she threatened me. And you said you didn't want to see her anymore, so I sent Jason. What else was I supposed to do? You sent Jason instead of me? I-- You sent that little clown without telling her? Look, it was a calculated risk. Either she was gonna love him and be off our backs forever or-- Or what? Or this? Are you two having a lovers' quarrel? - We're not lovers. - That's accurate. We've been lovers, but not anymore. Why have you got to tell her that? What does that accomplish? - Because it's the truth. - You want to tell her the truth? Why don't you tell her about Jason? Go ahead, - tell her whose idea that was. - Fine, Ray. Maybe I will. I will. - Go ahead. Do it. - I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it. What are you gonna do? Lydia, I know you're feeling very hurt right now-- very very hurt and betrayed. Uh, it pains me to see you unhappy. When I found out you were a cop, I-- I panicked, Lydia. I handled it very badly. You handled it like shit. Yes, I handled it like shit. Well, guess what, boys and girls, we're back to plan A. Shit, that's him-- the husband-- the big one. What the fuck? The cop? - Yeah. - Fuck. Lydia, Lydia, how nice that you're married. Really, good for you. I mean, I've never been married myself, but I believe in it. I still believe in it. Lydia, I'm sure your husband's very nice. Yeah, I'm sure he'll like you too. Lydia, listen, don't do this. Lydia, I was a husband. Some secrets aren't meant to be shared, Lydia. - What's the point of telling him now? - No, don't shout at her. What good is that gonna do? I don't give a fuck. I just want to see what happens to his face. - No no no. - Why? Just to get back at him? - No, let me. - Will you fucking be quiet? You know nothing about it. You fucked me over just like he fucked me over. And now it's time for both of you to suffer. No no no, men can be jealous and irrational. No, we can talk about this. What? They are. So are women. How rational is this? God, she's going in there. Ray, oh my God. - Ow. - Oh my God, she's fucking talking to him. She's talking to him, Ray. She's talking to him. - I can see that. - She's pointing at us, Ray. - She's pointing at us. - I can see that. Okay, he's looking at us.  He's looking at us right now. Fuck, Ray, he's gonna fucking beat us up. - We're gonna fucking die. - Keep it together, will you? We're not gonna die. Nobody is gonna die. We're dead. We're dead-- dead, dead sitting ducks. Okay, she's coming back. She's coming back. - She's coming back. - Yes, okay. Just act natural. I can't. I can't act natural. Fuck me. So... How-- how did it go? How did it go? I told him you were a ho and a trick. I told him I found you fucking in the park. And then... I asked him what he wanted for breakfast. I told him I loved him. God, I'm pathetic. He destroys our marriage and I just-- I just-- I stand there and I smile. Lydia, sometimes I feel pathetic too, or I used to, but not anymore. Now I'm free to be me-- no handcuffs, no shackles, no masks. I'm just a woman, Lydia, just a woman. We are all just women, except for men, who aren't women at all. But we are women, Lydia. We are women. We are women. Hear us roar. We need to roar, Lydia. We can roar. Women have the hearts the size of balloons, Lydia-- balloons filled with helium. Our hearts are hot-air balloons filled with helium. Our hearts are the Hindenburg, Lydia. But we should not blow up, no no. We should fill up. Lydia, fill your heart. Lydia, feel your heart. Lydia. This isn't necessary, come on. Lydia, this really-- it isn't necessary. Okay, take your time. Take all the time you need. This is crazy. Are you just gonna leave her there? She's fine. What kind of person do you think I am? You don't like me very much, do you? It's okay. It's okay if you don't. I do like you, Lydia. I like the you sitting right here right now, beside me. I like the you in the bathroom, you know, until you hit me. I mean, I'm sorry your husband hurt you. I'm sorry. You hurt me too. Yeah, I know. They say it means nothing-- you know, men and whores. But when I'm with you, it just doesn't feel like nothing. Well, you know, women are different that way. You wanna fuck? It's the least I can do. No cops and robbers. No money. Just you and me. Mm. So maybe this wasn't our finest hour-- Tanya handcuffed to a lamp post; me trying to screw my way to freedom. That's it, Ray. You've got this, Ray. We're gonna be fine. We're golden. God, Ray, come on, fuck her and get it over with. But hey, no one said orgasmic living was easy. People aren't easy. They fall in love, get married... Drive each other nuts. We've all been there. Okay. Most of us just don't have a badge and a gun. - Come on. - What? We're going home, Tanya. We're going home. God, Ray, you motherfucker.
