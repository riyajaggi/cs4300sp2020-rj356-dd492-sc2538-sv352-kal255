 Tanya wants Ray to dump Lydia as a client because she's actually a cop (not just someone playing dress up), but Lydia's not cooperating. Tanya hires a substitute to entertain Lydia after Ray goes about disengaging the wrong way. Tanya seeks advice from Charlie, and Jessica, who's starting a new job, finds out that her boss loves musical theater. She may become his Dulcinea. Ray is smitten with Logan - is she jail bait?

 Tuesday. You're welcome to join if you want. Well, what do you want? I want an apartment in Paris. I want new parents. I wanna go back inside and get another drink. Why, Mr. Drecker? What do you want? It doesn't make sense. Why would a cop dress up as a cop'? It makes more sense than some of these motherfuckers. Wanna wear diapers and get fed baby food. Look, I've been sending Ray to have sex with her. Rough sex. What am I supposed to do? - She paying you, right? - Yeah. Then keep doing what you're doing.

 - Most cops fuck for free. - No, I can't do that. I can't. I promised Ray I would get rid of her. She's a paying customer who will drag your ass in... if she becomes disgruntled. Keep her gruntled. So your ho gets a black eye or two. It's better than pissing her off and getting arrested. - I wouldn't even tell him. - I have to tell him. You don't understand. We're partners. Man, why do you ask me this shit? I mean, you come to me for advice... like I'm some kind of magical Yoda negro, but you don't listen. - I listen to the essence of your advice. - What essence? Could you not treat me like I don't know what I'm doing? I'm a successful pimp. I'm making money... and I did it my own way while you were in jail. Why did you bail me out then? I needed to stay someplace had a landline... so they could track me. I'm supposed to commiserate with non-felons... and, well, you're the only one I know. And because I like you. Probably should have put that at the top of the list... but, hey, that's me. What about you? Why did you bail me out? Six in the side. One in the corner. Eight in the side. Who's next, motherfuckers? Oh, don't stop. Oh, don't stop. Don't stop. Oh. - Oh, God. You scared the bejesus out of me. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Our hearts are still beating. - Who let you in? - Security. I wanted to get an early... start. It's 6:30 in the morning. I just wanted to familiarize myself with the system... so I filed all of the records. - Chronologically and alphabetically. - Great. Now go home. - No. - Yes, go home. - I wanna do a good job. - You are. Look, and you're running yourself ragged doing it. You're sick. Physically, not mentally. Nothing wrong with you mentally. But go home. Go on. Take an antihistamine, a decongestant. Get some rest. Go on. - So you like musicals. - Oh, no. I mean, I played Adelaide in high school. I can tell. Good morning, Mr. Drecker. How'd you sleep? It's good to see you again. You were always my favorite. He? He?' Aw... Drink some water, Mr. Drecker. You'll feel better. - You can call me Ray, you know. - I know. Where are you going? I'm gonna take a shower, maybe go back to bed. What are you doing, uh, later today? I'm gonna take a shower and maybe go back to bed. Logan Lewis. She had me in the palm of her hand. Ray, I called you 20 times last night. Shh, shh. Not so loud. Oh, my God, you look terrible. - What happened? - Ah. Where were you? Ray, would you stop? - Look, I'm trying to talk to you. - Just talk softly. Ray, Ray. Lydia's a cop, all right? I saw her last night in person, and she's a cop. - Makes sense. - Makes...? Ray, she's Ia policia. Look, look, she's 5-0 and we're criminals, okay? But here's the thing. We need to keep her satisfied. Satisfied? What are you talking about? - I thought we cut this lady loose. - We need to reconsider that. Um, apparently it's common practice... for prostitutes to keep police people as clients... - ...from what I've read. - She almost busted my ribs. - I'm out. I'm done. - Please, let's not go to jail, okay? I don't wanna go to jail either. That's why I'm not gonna see her anymore. All right, well, somebody's gotta tell her. I mean, she can't know we know. We gotta let her down easy. - Right? - You're the pimp. I'm the p... I'm the pimp? What? What? You said we were partners. Fuck, Ray. She's gonna know I'm lying. You know, I'm a bad liar. - She'll see right through me. - All right, I'll do it. Call her up. Tell her I'll meet her in a public place with witnesses. Great, okay. Uh, ahem. Lenore, what about this one? The ones in the back are better. She said I could have any one I wanted. - Maybe they're better in the back. - Yeah, I want this one. And when are you gonna ask about that other thing? I'm waiting for the right time. Okay. Lenore? All right, this area. Anything you want. - Where's Sandee? - I think she wants one from the front. - These have a higher resolution. - They're dented. They have a better warranty. You said we could pick any cane. Any one of these. I think Sandee wants one up front. I think Sandee is a leech and a liar who faked a pregnancy to try to trap you. No, she's a great fiancée, Lenore. I think that I should be making more than $200 per woman. I think 400 is closer to the going rate. Jason, your going rate is $200. How much did they pay you to fuck me? How much does your boss pay you to bus tables? Hmm? Yeah. Pick a TV, Jason. Thank me later. Understand it's not you. It's all me. Uh-huh. You know, I need to do stuff. I've never been to Paris. I mean, I've never been to Africa. I wanna travel. You know, riverboat, bicycle. Are you sure it's not because I was too aggressive with you? No, no, I'm positive. I just... I thought that I could let it all hang out with you. Oh, you can. I mean, you could, if I wasn't just giving it all up... but I am. I'm sweet. I think I haven't shown you my sweet side. I know. Looking at you now, um... - Heh. - I am so different... from what you think I am, Richard. You can't just leave with no warning. - I can't accept that. I simply can't - You can't? Come on, let's just enjoy each other one more time... then I'll be happy. Yes. Oh, Richard, I enjoy you. - I enjoy you so much. - Oh, yes. I enjoy you too. Yeah, papi, yeah! Ay, how could you leave me? It's not you, it's me. I could do this all day. - All night. - So could I. - Every day. - Yeah. Yeah. - Ow! - Oh, I'm sorry. - What...? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, I don't know why I did that. I'm sorry. I never wanna stop. Never, never, never. Tell me that you didn't end it with her... by having sex with her in a bathroom. That was after I ended it. That's not how you end it, Ray. Oh, God, I'm the one who said we should keep her happy. - You said, "No, I don't wanna see her." - I don't. Well, now she thinks she's still a client. She says that you wanna fuck her forever. That's... Those are not the words that I used. Well, those are the words that she heard. Well, I was, uh, in the moment, okay? She was looking good. She was wearing a dress. You had sex with a cop because she wore a dress? Well, it had flowers on it. I mean, look, we were just two people doing what people do. - And then she slapped me. - She hit you'! She's a violent woman, Tanya. It's a problem. Well, now you have to keep seeing her. No, I'm not. I ended it. I made it very clear. And what happens after that is besides the point! Men and their fucking penises. So, uh, Lydia, you know, I spoke with Richard... and he apologizes if, uh, he gave you the wrong idea. He's sorry we fucked at the restaurant? Oh, no, no. No, no, not at all. He enjoyed that very much. He regrets that his actions were confusing. He has a lot going on right now. And. you know, Richard is leaving the business... for entirely personal reasons. Between me and you, I'm furious. I mean, he left me with no notice, without a replacement. I mean, if I don't find somebody soon, my goose is cooked. I mean, it's a big problem for me. Do you think I give a shit what your problems are? - Lydia. Lydia, let's be civil. - Fuck civil. You know that thing that I wanted to do? Well, I wanna do it tonight. Lydia, that's just... It's not possible. - Uh, Richard is... - Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot. I know when I'm being lied to. So if you wanna keep this wellness center... I strongly suggest a burglar show up at my house. Ten o'clock sharp. Fuck me. Um... Hey, this is Ray. Leave your number. Yeah, Ray, I need to talk to you. Um, Lydia wants to see you tonight. She's a scary woman, Ray. I don't wanna go to jail. Ray, where are you? 'Whoa-hon! Get her! Ha-ha! - Aah! - I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you! - Get him, kid! - Go get her. Don't listen to her. Get the old guy, that old guy! Goddamn it. - That's it! - Get back in your vehicle, sir. Sir, you must remain... Sir! You can't do that! Sir, return to your vehicle. Come here. It's cool that you wanted to see me. I wanted to see you too, but I need your number, Tanya. Okay. Okay, we need to talk, okay? I have... I have something that might interest you. - Oh, I'm interested. - Heh. All right, stay... Stay on topic, okay? This is business. Did you... '2 Did you tell Lenore about us? Oh, fuck, no. I'm not her slave. - I do what I wanna do. - Oh, my God. - When do you get off work? - About 9. Why? Because... All right, look, I'm trying to tell you I have a job. I have a job that might interest you. Does it pay $400? Um... Okay. Cool. Shh. Freeze! Hands where I can see them. Higher. Nice and high. That's it. Got any weapons? Are you packing? Are you fucking packing? What the fuck? Who the fuck are you? - Wait, what? - Unh. Yeah, yeah. Oh. Oh, that's beautiful. Oh, don't stop. Oh, right there, right there. Matt, please. - Am I hurting you? - No, no, it's not that. Heh. Am I too big? I'm too big. No. It's not that. - I can go slower if you want. - No. - I can go faster too. - It's not that either. - Are you okay? I'm fi... Yeah. Mm. That's it. I'm good. - That's it. - What? - You're good? - I'm good. - Jessica. - Yeah. Oh. Ah. Um... - Did you have fun? - It's late. - I have to go home. - Okay, sure. If you're good, I'm good. Oh. Heh-heh.

Oh, yes, yes, you in the back, with the beautiful pom-poms. My name is Logan, Mr. Drecker. My question was, uh, do you think you could, like, lose the jockstrap? It's really distracting. Absolutely.
