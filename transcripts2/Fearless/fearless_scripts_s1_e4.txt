 Where's the SIM card she gave you? I'll give it to my client, no-one else. Where is it now? Where's the SIM card? No idea. Why's Tony Pullings crawling out of the woodwork? He stopped me in the street, asked me if I wanted to be famous. I know nothing about Tony Pullings. Yeah, well, I know who you're protecting. I'm protecting you, Tony. I have all your negatives, remember? The men that are guarding Pullings are American. What's your interest in Kevin Russell?

 We have no interest in him. We have an interest in you. I followed your lead, I found nothing. The Americans are not involved. He's running for the leadership. Will he win? He is where your investment should lie. The defence pathologist has an alternate theory of how the girl was killed. Then advance a counter-theory. It's hard when her theory is actually true. She was hit by a car. Find the angle, do your job. Are they yours? Do you want something? I do. Well, she can protect me, you can't. 'She'? Who's 'she'? Way down in the water

 Way down in the hole Far away from any soul Where there is discord, may we bring harmony and where there is despair, may we bring hope. I'm coming back from the fire Put your trust in us. Crawling back from the flames We shall repay that trust for you. Coming back from the fire, and I'll burn it down Turn it! Turn! Spin the camera. Spin the camera! Uh... Kevin, remember what we said. Just tell the truth and we'll put this right, OK? Yeah. See you up there. That, in your view, is what happened? Linda was not hit with a shovel? No man wielding a shovel could produce the wedge fractures that broke all four bones in Linda's legs simultaneously. That could only be done by a car? It could only be done by a car. Thank you. Mr Russell, in February 2003, did you have a car or access to a car the weekend Linda disappeared? No. So you couldn't have hit Linda with a car? No. So why did you confess to hitting her with a shovel? I was questioned for two days straight. It's on the tapes. Plus, I was feeling guilty because... I knew about Linda and the photos. Annie, my fiancee, is pregnant and I've got photos of this girl naked. But, still, why confess to murder? The police are showing me all this stuff, traces of Linda in my hut, her hair, bits of clothing... and then her body buried 20 yards away. I was going completely mental. You know, how did she get there? What happened? What did I do? Detective Greenwood, she was so certain. She started saying that she didn't need me to confess because she had all the evidence but that it would go better for me in court if I told the truth. Then at least... Then at least my boy could see that I'd been a man. That'd I'd stood up and I'd told the truth. So I said I did it. But you didn't? No. I didn't do it. Because I couldn't. I didn't have a car. Mr Russell. Thank you. Ms Osborne, do you have any questions? Ms Osborne? I'm sorry, my Lord. Ms Osborne? Er... I'd like Mr Russell to look at something. My Lord, what is this? A crime scene photo of Mr Russell's workshop. It's already in evidence. Carry on, Ms Osborne. Do you recognise the photo? Yeah. And in the photo, in the bottom right-hand corner, next to the tape measure, what are they? Well, they're keys. To what? The school van. And they were kept in your workshop? Well, a spare set, in case the main set got lost or shut up in the school. Could you drive this van? Well, of course, I was the caretaker. And you had access to it at any time? No. But the keys were right there. You could have driven the van at any time. You could have driven the van at any time... No. .. including the night that Linda died. No. Answer, please, Mr Russell. You could have driven the van at any time. No! Emma? What... Wh-what... What do I say? Answer, please, Mr Russell. Emma? Emma, what do I say? Emma? Emma, what do I say? I was watching the jury. In their eyes, Kevin went from completely innocent to completely guilty in 30 seconds. It wasn't just the jury. Jason thought that Kevin was innocent too. For a few seconds, he'd got his dad back. Do you want another one? Hey! Sorry... What was that? It's all right. I do apologise. Sorry about that. No problem. I'll clear it up. Thank you. What is it? Yusef Attar wants to meet me. What, he's here in the UK? Jesus! Em, you can't. You have to steer clear, now more than ever. His wife's going crazy in jail. He's got a kid in there too. I can't just do nothing. As you know, I fought in the war. I was one of the lucky ones, I got out with life and limb intact. Many didn't, many men and women that I was honoured to serve with. And it's to them that I make two pledges. If ever I'm in a position to influence the policies of this country, I will fight with every bone in my body to make sure that our veterans get all the care they and their families need. My second pledge is that we will never go to war unless our interests are directly threatened. We will honour our alliances but we will not sacrifice our men and women to other nations' misguided ambitions and strategies. That'll go down well in Washington. Kretchmer asked me to talk to you. He must be pleased. I hear Russell blew himself up in court today. I blew him up. But it was just dumb luck. Kretchmer wants to take the win. Hm. He wants you to end the trial now. But how? I don't have that power. Then you'd better find it. And now my lovely wife, Laura, will draw the winning numbers from tonight's raffle. So get your tickets ready. If this goes to the jury, there are no guarantees. Quit while we're ahead. What's that? Abu al-Tabib. It means 'father doctor', 'father physician'. It's how they often refer to Yusef Attar. What are they saying? They're implying that he's back in the UK, because the Kafir jailed his wife. Better let SO15 know about this. Hello. Emma, at last! Miriam, it's late. It's the only time I could get to the phones. Emma, you have to get us out. I'm trying. They're just playing hardball because of Yusef. I don't know where he is or what he's doing. Please explain this to them. The women, they call me a terrorist. They want to fight. I'm scared for Karim. I can try and get you moved. Please, no. Get me out! Miriam, please just try and remain calm. How can I stay calm if I'm going mad? My money's going. Emma, come and see me. I've no-one else. It's Alastair. I'm calling in that favour. Kevin Russell. So that's our position. The CPS would accept a plea to the lesser charge of manslaughter. The victim's family have been consulted and have agreed. The most the judge would've imposed would be 12 years, so your client... No. .. would be released for time served. No. I thought you would say that. So why did you bother asking me? I'm not asking you, I'm asking your client. And you're obliged to present this to him. Aren't you? So... it'd be like an accident? I hit her with the car by accident? No, you'd be saying that you killed Linda but you didn't intend to. That sounds like an accident to me. It's not. I don't want to sugar-coat this for you. You'd be admitting you hit her with a van and killed her. And then buried her while she was still alive? I'd... I'd be admitting that too? Why aren't you saying anything? Because I don't like this. So you think I shouldn't do it, that we're gonna win? I think we CAN win. And you don't? The way I read the jury, I think we could lose completely, which means a guilty verdict for murder, which means at least another 15 years. And if I... If I accept this 'manslaughter' thing... Then you're free. You've done the time, you've paid your debt. Will I get to see Jason? I've been watching him in court. He's been every day. I think he knows the truth... that I didn't do it. I want to get to know my son. Emma, you've got me this far. Tell me what to do. All rise. Right. Mr Nolenn? As discussed, my Lord, the defendant would like the indictment put again. Stand up, Mr Russell. Mr Russell, you are charged on an indictment containing one count of murder, in that on a day between 1st and 3rd February, 2003, you murdered Linda Simms. How do you plead? I plead not guilty to murder, my Lord, but... guilty to manslaughter. Ms Osborne? My Lord, we were on notice of this plea. In the light of the forensic ambiguities, we will not be seeking a verdict on the murder count. And a verdict of not guilty on the murder count will be entered. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your time. You are welcome to return for the sentencing of Mr Russell for the offence of manslaughter. But I will tell you that this is a formality, since Mr Russell has already served the term he would have received for this offence. He will be released as early as is practicable. Case is closed. All rise. I'm surprised you took the deal. It was his decision. And whatever he said in there... .. he's innocent. Then... who killed Linda Simms? The people who protected Tony Pullings. The people who scared my witness off. And who are they? Tell me where Pullings is. He knows. You know you missed him in 2003. He was a material witness right under your nose. And you missed him. And you have to know he's not working alone now. So... .. where is he? Where's Yusef Attar? I've no idea. But you know he's back in the UK. So where is he? Well, then. 'The second Russell trial cost the UK taxpayer nearly ?2 million. And the result? The same, Russell's guilt confirmed. When will the courts stamp down on the irresponsible actions of attention-seeking activist lawyers?' That's you. Yeah, well, they're not wrong, are they? Well, what did I achieve? Maybe it's time to stop. Maybe I've lost my... Maybe it's time to crawl on my knees to the adoption services and tell them that I've stopped, beg for a second chance. Seriously? Why not? My house is now empty. I still long for a child. Speaking of which, when we've finished with Kevin, I want to go to Sizemore, see Miriam and Karim. Hold that thought. Hurry. Get him. Mr Russell, how do you feel about the reopening of old wounds? Hi, Emma, Kev. Hi, Annie, Jason. I thought we could have a coffee and a chat, yeah? Why don't we all sit together, Kev? I've waited 14 years, Annie. Um... well, why don't Annie and I have a quick walk? Great. So do you want a tea or a coffee or... Coke. Or Coke? Be kind, love. I'm just outside. He didn't wanna come. In the end, Derek had to insist. Well, I told Kevin not to expect too much. Oh, I got him a part-time job. And accommodation. Jason? What happened? Nothing happened. I wanna go home. What did you do? Told him it was all bullshit. He killed her. I told him to stay away from me. Jay, how could you? Kevin! Hi. Any news? They're still operating. So there's still a chance? How? I saw it. The truck... Where's Annie? Erm... with Jason. He's taken it really badly. As he should, the little shit. He's a kid. You're right. It's not his fault. I told Kevin I believed he didn't do it. And I said I'd prove it. And I didn't. And then I gave up on him. Hardly. I let him take that stupid deal. I betrayed my client! Em, you did everything you could. 'Where's Yusef Attar?' 'No idea.' 'But you know he's back in the UK. Where is he?' 'I think he's a bad egg, Dom, and I think he's screwing me.' 'You still have the SIM card?' 'Why, what's on it?' 'Can you give it to Yusef's nephew?' Matt. Heather. You can thank me if you want. Old reliable, cleaning up the Brits' mess. Not just our mess. In fact, primarily, not our mess. Soon we won't be able to do this, you know? Secret assignations. You'll be far too well known. I doubt it. Don't doubt it. You'll win. Which is why I wanted to see you. That speech two days ago did not go down well in Washington. It didn't sound like the words of a stalwart ally. I will not be dictated to, Alastair told me you were worth investing in. So do you want to sit at the top table, make a difference in the world, or do you just want to make speeches, like the last two leaders of your party? Is it really over? Kevin Russell? Yes. The girl's back in the ground and no-one's gonna have the energy to dig her up again. Not even Emma Banville. What about Tony Pullings? He's off the grid. Soon we'll have him out of the country. What do you want? Kevin Russell's in a coma. I heard. He was talking to his son Jason. Jason said he knew he was guilty. He walked into a truck. Does that sound like the act of a guilty man? Yes, possibly. Look, I'm not gonna let this go. Just tell me how I can find Tony Pullings. Tell me how to find Yusef Attar. You know I can't do that. Do you understand? I can't do that. Ruby's playing games again. Where is she? Banville went dark ten minutes ago. She often goes dark. Not like this. She's in Birmingham. Jenna, she just called me. She might be sending a message. Have everyone standing by. Stand by. She got in a cab outside Birmingham station. We've got the number plates and we're talking to dispatch. Throw the battery. I've done it. Let me see. Put this on. Dispatch have said she's got out on St Paul's Road, middle of Sparkhill. There's no hope of tracing her. What do we do? We wait. Thank you for everything you did for my family, for looking after them so well. Yusef, I need to know what you're doing. You must know how risky it is being here. I'm breaking the law by even meeting you. I know you. I know you don't care about the law. No, I care passionately about the law. That's why I'm defending you. And as your lawyer, I advise you to come with me to the police now. Emma, Emma, Emma, Emma. You're scared. Yeah, I'm scared. Doesn't mean I'm wrong. What I need from you is the SIM card my wife gave you. You have it, yes? What's on the card? What my friends said. Phone numbers of people who support us, who fund us. Who's 'us'? Me. A doctor working in desperate circumstances with refugees in Syria. If that's true, come with me to the police now. I'm disappointed. I thought if anyone in the West would understand what we're doing, it would be you. Sorry, who am I talking to? Who are you? 70 years ago, the Jews made the desert bloom. Yes, they stole the land, but they built a miracle. And all the talents of their diaspora came to help them. We're doing the same. Except we didn't steal anyone's land. Doctors, engineers, teachers, trying to build a state, make our desert bloom. So we can live free, according to our faith. Help us, Emma. If that was it, I would, gladly. But that's not all, is it? We are in a war. We have to fight. It's how you fight. I won't have any part of it. None. Birmingham are requesting instructions. They wait. That's the instruction. Tell me... when did you change? Or have you always been lying? When did I change? Was it the 20th child killed by a Western bomb or the 100th? I don't know. But it becomes very clear out there... .. what is right, what is not right. God makes it clear. Please, Yusef... .. you have a family here. You have a child. I have nothing here. Do you have the SIM card with you? No. Imran. Just to get this clear, you're firing me? Get her out. She's back on. Moseley Lane, Sparkhill, between St Paul's and Highgate. Do we have any suspect addresses? One, 74a. Cordon the area, send the teams in. And Banville? Pull her in? No. Yeah. Tactical team, go. Where am I? Where...? Roger that. Approaching target. Hold it. Go, go, go! Armed police! Armed police! Down on the floor now! Police! Get down on the floor! Get down! Down, on the floor! Down! Armed police! Bravo Two, go, go, go. Armed police, get on the floor! Police, show me your hands! Show me your hands! This is Two Alpha. We have Yusef Attar in custody, identity confirmed. Congratulations, everyone. What exactly do you want us to do? Scare the hell out of him. Hello, Tony. Argh! Urgh! I'll bloody sue you! Fine, I can recommend a solicitor. Get out. Just get out! Who's protecting you, Tony? Who are the wankers who smashed my bike? I don't know what you're on about. Then I'll call the press. Boy, are they itching to talk to you, Tony. I'm not talking to you. Piss off! Then I'll put Linda's photos back out there. And then I'll add Siobhan's, too. Now, she said you slept with her. She was intimidated into not testifying, but once the press are at the door, she'll have to talk. And once she's outed, how long before the other girls decide to get ahead of the story, before the story destroys them too? And then they're all gonna be talking about some creep with a camera and a smooth mouth in Suffolk in 2003. You'd ruin their lives too? Where are your bloody ethics? You're a lawyer. Who just saw her innocent client walk in front of a truck. So, fuck my ethics! We just wanna know about Linda. Did you go to her or did she come to you? She came to me. Why? The reason I said, she wanted photos. She wanted to be a model. Why? No idea what that is. Why did she want the photos? I told you. Right. I'll call the press. She said they were a going-away present. Who for? Her boyfriend. Who was he? Did he work on the base? I dunno. What was his name? I don't know. Agh! Aargh! I still owe you for my ribs. What was his bloody name? His name? Lo... It was Logan. Logan. Where was Logan going away to? Iraq. Where'd you bloody think? What was his last name? Tony? What was his last name? I don't know. Tony, please. His last name. Now, we can protect you. You can't. And I don't know his last name, she never said it. We have a first name, we know he was with an F-16 squadron and we know when he was at RAF Crawbury. We can identify him. And I know a man who can track him down. And then what? And then I'm gonna go to America and I'm gonna talk to that son of a bitch. With your record and your clients, you think the Americans will let you in? 'Passengers must clear Customs before collecting their bags. That's quite a record for a lawyer. Trespass, property damage, resisting arrest. Assaulting a police officer. I was the one who ended up in hospital. What were you doing? Protesting against the presence of American nuclear weapons on English soil. I was very young. And the purpose of your visit today? Er... conference on copyright law. This the hotel where you're staying? Yes. Welcome to New York. Thank you. Hey. It's me. Emma? Larry. It's a funny place to meet. You paying your respects to someone? Sort of. What have you got? Well, I got your guy. He's National Guard now, so easier to track. First name, Logan, last name, Bradley. In 2002, he was an airman with the 23rd Fighter Squadron at the United States Air Force in Suffolk, England. He looks like a child, for God's sake. He was a child, only 17. Do you think I'm wrong about this? 24 hours after your girl's disappearance, Logan was posted to Kuwait alone, two weeks ahead of his squadron. He's part of this, all right. Where is he now? He's a staff sergeant with the 114th Air National Guard at Andrews, just outside of DC. Even got you his home address. Larry, you're an angel. Wait till you get my invoice. It's a four-hour drive. And you better get started, because if the Military finds out you're here, they're gonna hide Logan in Korea or some place. And, Emma? They will find out you're here. What is it, sir? Emma Banville just got flagged coming into the country. Did you know about this? No, sir. When? Today. Attending some conference on copyright law. She's not remotely interested in copyright law. Then what's she doing here? I'll find out. Where is she staying? New York, the Marriott, according to her Customs declaration form, anyway. Find her. What have we got? 'Do not disturb' sign on the door. Bed looks like it's been slept in but none of the towels used. Looks like she checked for listening devices. She is on the list of conference attendees, but as of 30 minutes ago, she hadn't checked in. She won't. Get me the Air Force, Department of Personnel Management. Logan Bradley? Yes, ma'am. I want to talk about Linda Simms. Um... Linda Simms. England, 2003. Remember? Who are you, media? I'm a lawyer. I represent the man who spent 14 years in jail for having killed Linda Simms. I'm sorry, I don't know anything about this. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. If I leave, do you know where I'm going next? To the police. I've got these photos and the man who took them. I know that Linda lived near to the airbase where you were stationed. And I know you were transferred off that airbase 24 hours after she went missing. I know you know exactly who she is. Do you think I'd hurt that girl? Or any girl? Fine. I'm going to the police. Don't you fucking think about it. Let go of me! Stay right there! Don't do this. I got a wife, I got a kid. Please just go. Not till you tell me what happened between you and Linda. That's Air Force Police. You should've gone. I'm gonna tell my story. I don't care who I tell it to. Emma Banville? Who wants to know? Come with us, please. Sergeant Marcus, put her in the vehicle. What did she say to you, Sergeant Bradley? Nothing that made any sense. She's crazy. Stay home until you hear from me. Don't talk to anyone, understand? Yes, sir.
