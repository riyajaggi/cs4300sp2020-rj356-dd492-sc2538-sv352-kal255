 Chicago Justice (2017): Season 1, Episode 1 - Fake - full transcript 
 Firehouse 51 responded to a horrific warehouse fire that killed 39 people. This led the Chicago P.D. on a manhunt for the suspect. Now with someone in custody for both arson and multiple murders, it is up to Peter Stone and his team, including lead investigator Antonio Dawson to step in to bring some peace and resolution to so many families and friends of those lost - including one very close to home. When the team comes face to face with a hotshot attorney, they find themselves up against a dicey confession, incriminating evidence, and a questionable motive.

 The address for the alarm is on our target list. See if they have any information from Fire Prevention. Tell 'em to relay it en route. Yes, sir. [sirens wailing] 1100 Fulton, that's commercial, isn't it? - Big warehouses? - Yeah. Remote area at night. Must be burning pretty good to have so many people call it in. Unless they're calling from inside. How far are we? Four or five blocks. You guys smell that?

What's the layout in there? Ah, it's crazy. It's full of stuff. It's practically made out of kindling. We're gonna pull a lot of bodies out of there, Chief. I was dancing with this girl when the fire started. I don't even know her name, but she was in a-a pink dress. I... [coughing] I think she's still inside. We'll keep an eye out. [sirens wailing] Chief Walker's here. Let me go in. - Go. - Otis, let's go. Fire Department! Call out! Fire Department! Call out! Fire Department! Hey! Fire Department! Help! Help! Where are you?

Okay, hold it steady. We got it. Go ahead. Okay, hon, you're coming with me, all right? Help us! Hey, stay there, we can only take one person at a time. Hey, do not climb over here!

Hang on to me, okay? Okay. [grunts] - That sucked. - Hey, come here. - Come on, easy, easy. - Wait... okay. Take it slow. All right, we got you. - [coughing] - [shouting] - Chout! - Yep! - [coughing] - Smoke inhalation. A few lacerations. - She's having trouble breathing. - We'll take care of her. You're gonna be okay, Kathy. Hang in there. [coughing and wheezing] Hey, 61, heads up! All right, you're okay, buddy. Where are you hurt? All right. He got pancaked. I'm okay, really. Take him in. - Casey, there's a lot more... - Mouch. Three minutes and nobody else goes inside. Squad 3, evacuate the building. Severide, report! Severide! On our way, Chief. Bringing out two victims. Wallace. Wallace. Al, what is it? My daughter, Lexi. She's in there. - What? - She's in there. My daughter, Lexi. She's in there. - What?

Come on. Dawson! You seen Olinsky's daughter, Lexi? Hey... - Well, she didn't come through triage. - Wallace... Wallace, I beg you. I beg you. Al, I have pulled my people out. That building's gonna collapse any second. We have got to get water on that fire and hope that she made it. Chief, Severide and Cruz are back. Severide, report. It's bad. We can hear voices in the back, delta side. We're gonna need another minute. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Al! - We got to go in there! - Wait! Hold on. Hold on. - We got to go in! - Hold back. - I'm begging you, man. Please. Please! I'm begging you. Lead the way. [indistinct chatter] - Hang tight, Mouch. - Yep. [indistinct chatter] Maggie! Maggie. - Mouch? - Hey. - Hey. You okay? - I'm good. - Let me check you. - Incoming. Jumped out of a second-story window. GCS 3, intubated in the field. Okay. Lungs are clear. Let's get a chest X-ray - and call trauma down now. - Maggie? Trauma 3 just opened up. Go, go, go, go, go. I'll check in at the nurse's station. - Wait a second. - Maggie, help the ones who really need it. - You sure? - Yeah. Get back to the fire. Okay. Yeah? Chout, go! I need some help over here! I need some help here! Fire department! Call out! They'll find her. Fire department! Call out! Back here! Help us! This way! Lexi! Hey, Lexi. Hey, Lexi. Come on, come on. - Stay with us. - [grunts] Ah! It's too hot. Through that wall! Lexi. Come on, Lexi. Get down. Come on. I got her. Go. Severide! Boden! Someone! Report! - I'm going in after them. - No! Stay there. [girl coughing] Lexi! We got her. We got her. Let us work. We got her. We got her. - Let us do our job, okay? - Lexi, baby. Watch out. Watch out. Take the front seat, Al. I'm bringing down extra staff from upstairs. How many nurses do you need? - Everybody you got. - Okay. Dr. Choi? I'm coordinating with the burn unit, so if there's anything you need, you let me know. Got it. You good? Ms. Goodwin, if you're worried about me because of the burn victim I lost last week... No, no. I just want to make sure you stop and catch your breath every once in a while. That's all. - Yes, ma'am. - Okay. - I just heard. - Yeah, there are a whole lot of patients, family, and friends here who may need help. You might need more staff. Got it. Got a 19-year-old with large area 3rd degree burns and smoke inhalation. All right. Take her to Baghdad. - Copy. - Tachypneic and tachycardic. Sats are marginal. Hey, Lexi, I'm here. She's awake. She's awake. Natalie, with me. What kind of body surface area are we talking? Sixty percent. All right. On my count. One, two, three. Draw an ABG, CBC, carboxyhemoglobin, and lactate. Get a chest X-ray and run her fluids wide open. Lexi, I'm Dr. Halstead. Can you hear me? - She's barely moving air. - Swelling's getting worse. We need to intubate. Got it. Give me 20 of etomidate, 60 of roc. You're gonna be okay, sweetheart. You're gonna be okay. - Hey, Al. - You're okay. Come on. Come on. Let us take care of her, all right? Her airway's really tight. She's bradying down. You want the cric kit? Nope. I'm in. All right, get her on the vent. Nice job. How the hell does something like this happen? Wish I knew, Chief. Let's get some blankets on these bodies. - Let's cover them up. - Yeah. I saw you at the fire. What happened? Oh, a balcony collapsed. I was underneath. But I was lucky. They pulled us out quick. I was lucky, too. Everyone was screaming and pushing. Then I saw a window through all the smoke, just ran for it. The window was up high, so I climbed and pulled myself out. That's good. No. No, I don't think so. I couldn't reach, so I stepped on something... someone. I stepped on someone to get out. Maybe they were still alive. I don't even know. Hey, hey. I was so scared. If I'd just stopped to help, maybe they'd be okay. Maybe they are. No. Mm-mm. Listen. Listen to me. You didn't start that fire. Whatever happened, none of this is on you. Al. Al. Hey. They're working on her in there, got her in a medical coma, I think. Can I get you anything, or... She was breathing. And I saw her eyes open, so. - Oh, that's good, Al. - Yeah. - So she's gonna be okay. - Yeah. She's gonna be okay. Hey. Hey. We've put Lexi on a ventilator - and sedated her. - Okay. Okay, we'll keep her there for the next 24 hours, watch her closely. She's in burn shock. Her lungs were badly injured by the smoke. We're doing everything we can for her. Is she gonna be okay? We're gonna take really good care of her. Can I go in and see her? - Of course. - Okay. Baby... Sweet girl... Hey, sweet girl. Sweet girl. [crying] Hey. - Chief. - Sergeant. I understand the only reason Lexi Olinsky is alive is because of you. Thank you. Just one father looking out for another. - both: Commander. - Chief. This is Lieutenant Alexa Hubble from OFI. Hank Voight, Intelligence. This is Commander Crowley. - Lieutenant. - Casey. - All right, so what do we know? - Building owner's name is Barry Kimball. He's already reached out to CFD, promised to cooperate with the investigation. Does he know how many people were living and partying on his property? According to him, no. He thought it was just a small group. When can my investigators get inside? 66, can we release the scene to OFI yet? Affirmative. We're done in here. Scene's all yours. - You want to join us? - Please. Thank you, Lieutenant. I saw it on the news. It must have been really rough. Well, you guys should eat something. I don't think anyone's too hungry right now. Hospital update. Death toll's up to 33. Otis. Sorry. All those kids out having a good time. And that guy looking for his dancing girl in a pink dress. Oh, I know. Didn't even know her name. Wait, pink dress? We pulled out a girl with a pink dress. What was her condition? Not great, but we got her to a rig. You remember her name? Damn. No. Uh... but Casey talked to her. I'll call him. Hi. It's Anna. Leave me a message, and I'll call you back. Hey, Anna. It's me. Um, sorry I haven't gotten in touch. I guess I wasn't sure if you'd want to hear from me. We... we had a pretty rough night here, and, thing is... I miss you. It'd be nice to hear your voice. If you get a sec, give me a call. Bye. Hey. You heading home? No. I'm gonna head back to the factory, see if OFI needs a hand. Suzi's working in the southwest quadrant. You want to help her out, Severide? I'd be happy to. Please. I'm just here to pay my respects on this tragic, tragic day. When was the last time your building was inspected by the city? I don't know any more than you do about why this happened. I'm just here to say how sorry I am... - how deeply sorry I am - Casey. for my part in any of this. You own this fire trap? Okay, everybody needs to back up. - Officer, who is he? - He's the property owner. My cousin died in there! Where were the fire exits? Where were the sprinklers? I thought the building was safe. - You killed them! - Okay, everyone needs to disperse, now! Come on, everybody just... - [all shouting at once] - What the hell is this? [all shouting at once] Come on! Come on! - Go, go, go, go, go! - Come on! - Okay, everybody. Calm down! - You're gonna have to relax, sir. Calm down! [all shouting at once] Calm down. Calm down! - Am I under arrest? - No. This is just a conversation. Some place you won't be overrun by an angry mob. There weren't supposed to be that many people inside. Those parties are usually a lot smaller. Mr. Kimball, your building isn't permitted for public events of any size. Am I to understand that you had people living there? Just a few. In a building not zoned for residential use. I was just trying to help those kids. They don't have a lot of money, and Chicago is so expensive these days. I'm not some slumlord trying to make a fast buck. That was my father's factory. I didn't want to just get rid of it. And if these kids want to live there and use it to create their art... You get the building up to code. Give them someplace safe to live. What can I do? What can I do to make it right? You can start by making us a list of all of your tenants and anyone who had access to the factory. This place is... what's the word? Byzantine? No sprinkler system, no clearly marked exit signs, no fire extinguishers. I saw one back there, but it hasn't been inspected since '95. I stand corrected. My money's on electrical fire. Wiring in this place is a nightmare. I'm gonna say open flame. You know, space heater, a candle that got kicked over. Hey, Suzi, look at this burn pattern. Think this could be the area of origin? Could be. Yeah, yeah, could be. Whoa. We found out her first name. It's Kathy. - Kathy. - We checked at area hospitals, and they haven't found a Kathy yet, but they're sending us a list of all of their Kathleens and Kathryns. If she isn't at any of the hospitals, is there a chance that... she didn't make it? Last our guy saw, she was alive. Okay. Okay. Thanks. When I was dancing with that girl... with Kathy... I was thinking, "I'm gonna remember this night." Now everyone will. We'll let you know as soon as we find anything out, okay? Something good has to come out of what happened there, right? We'll find her? Yeah. Okay, sweetie, take care. We'll see you later. We don't really know if she's okay. Can't stop now. [sighs] Chief? Chicago Med has lost another victim. [exhales] That brings it up to 36. - I know. - That's on you, Mr. Kimball. Easy. He gets it. Sure. He gets it now. Far too late for all those young people and their grieving families. Lieutenant, is there a, um, bathroom I could use? Yeah. Straight back, down the hall. Thank you. Are there any exits near the bathroom? He's not going anywhere. [gunshot] Oh, my God. Mr. Kimball's rash and tragic decision to take his own life will not slow or alter our investigation. We want to know why and how this fire happened, and we will get answers. My office is working with the Chicago Police and with CFD. Our city and our people are stronger when we come together, and it is my hope that the citizens of Chicago will continue... Did nobody think to pat this guy down? I was there to protect him, ma'am, not arrest him. Kimball was under threat at the fire scene, so Lieutenant Hubble asked if we could bring him here. This is a tragic end to a tragic day. Excuse me? I'm sorry to interrupt, but is one of you named Matt Casey? Yeah. That's me. You saved my daughter's life. All of you did. She remembered everything you said to her, said if it wasn't for you, she never would've made it out of the factory. We own Kathy's Polish Deli on 17th, and we'd be honored if you all came by for some of the best kielbasa in town, on us. Bring everyone. That's very generous. Yeah, you know, that sounds like just the right thing, so I'll put the word out. It's Kathy's Deli? Yes. It's named after our daughter, the light of our life. Appreciate it. [laughs] [indistinct speech] [indistinct speech] Come on in. Lieutenant Casey would like to have a word. That was the first day you had. Yeah, it was. Is there anything I can get for you, Chief? No. I'm good. You can send in Lieutenant Casey now. Thank you, Marcie. - He'll see you now. - Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. Heading out. Just wanted to check in, see if you needed anything. No. Go on, get out of here. We've both talked to people on ledges. Usually we can tell if they're really gonna jump. How'd we miss this? Maybe he wasn't planning it. Maybe he just got overwhelmed. Whatever the reason, I wish that we could've stopped it. Yeah. Chief, Lieutenant Severide's here. Chief, you're gonna want to see this. Okay. What did you find? That's where the fire started. And that's what we found there. Electrical fire? That's a timing device. You take a brown paper bag, and you fill it with an oxidizer... kitty litter or chlorine. Then you take a light bulb and you fill it with fuel... gasoline, cooking oil, whatever. And you see the drill hole? That's where they filled it. You put the light bulb in the bag. Right. And now you've got a simple incendiary device. Drop the bag on the floor, you step on the bulb with your heel, and just walk away. Chemical reaction would start right away. Instructions are easy to find with a quick Internet search. [footsteps approaching] Kelly, hey. There is someone to see you on the amp floor. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. I can't imagine what the last 24 hours have been like. Are you okay? You came all the way up here to check on me? Sort of. I was actually already packing up my car when I heard about the Kimball fire. The thing is is that, um, last week, when I was heading home from work, it just suddenly hit me. You are not the only one who gets to decide when it's "someday," because "someday" was actually my idea, so I should be the one who gets to decide. Yeah. Sure... And I get why you wanted to stay in Chicago, 'cause I mean, it's the same reason I went back to Springfield... it's home. But then I... heard about this opening for a pediatric nurse at Med. You're the one who took the job at Med. - Yeah. - [laughs] Maggie told me you already asked about it for me, though. Actually, I wasn't supposed to tell you that, so if you tell her, she will kill me. "There were doors all around the hall, "but they were all locked, and when Alice had been "all the way down one side and up the other, "trying every door, "she walked sadly down the middle, "wondering how she was ever going to get out again. "Suddenly, she came upon a little three-legged table, "all made of solid glass. There was nothing on it but a tiny golden key." "Alice in Wonderland." Yeah. Thanks. She was Alice for Halloween every year until she was eight. Yeah? Excuse me. You know where Lexi Olinsky's room is? It's right here. - Sergeant. - Chief. - OFI has a conclusion. - And? That fire was intentionally set. This was mass murder. Dr. Halstead! Chief. Sarge. Lexi. What's going on? Do something. Hey, watch out. O2 sats are tanking. She's unable to oxygenate. - Lexi! Hey, Lexi! Lexi? - Al, come here. Come here. - Do something. - Al? Al. Hey! Step out. Do something, man. Lexi! - Come on. - Lexi! - Al. - Please! Get another blood gas, drop her tidal volume to 300, and increase her rate to 25, and up the PEEP to 10. - Start paralytics. 50 of Atricurium. - Lexi. Lexi... It's okay. - Doc, Doc, please... - Close that curtain. - Scissors. - [machine beeping] Her chest can't expand to accommodate the breath from the vent. - We need to release the skin. - Chest escharotomy? Yeah. Scalpel. [beeping] Air pressures are coming down. Sats are coming up. All right. Al. How's Lexi? Is... is she okay? What? Tell me. Tell me. She's in critical condition. - What? - She's in critical condition. [crying] - Where is she? - Okay, it's okay. Can I see her? I need to see her. - Hey, hey. - I need to see her. This is Meredith, Lexi's mom. This is Dr. Halstead, Jay's brother. So Lexi has burns over 60% of her body. Ohh, what? We had to make incisions in the burned area of Lexi's chest to improve her ability to breathe. I'll continue to update you every step of the way. And you're going to save her. Please? We're gonna do our best. - Oh. - Let the man do his job. Come on. Take a seat. Hey, take care of her. You take good care of her. Hey. Now you find whoever set that fire, and I want him alone. Detectives and arson investigators from across the city will not rest until the individual or individuals responsible are brought to justice. This cowardly act has robbed many of our Chicago citizens of their future. I'm being told that the structure was a home to many young and talented artists. If those responsible are watching this, they're about to feel the full strength and scope of the Chicago Police Department. Any questions? - Stone. - Hey. Antonio. The entire State's Attorney's office and investigators are at your disposal. - Good. - What do you need? Just have your people in Felony Review - ready to sign some warrants. - Done. Hey. I know Detective Olinsky's daughter - is among the injured. - Mm-hmm. But when I get this case file, it's got to be legit, by the numbers and tight. Hey, Sarge! Hey, when we responded to the call, this door was locked... so we thought... so we just pried the door open. - And you see these scratches? - Yeah. Whoever did this when they exited... they jammed these metal wedges underneath the door. - Excuse me a sec. - Yeah. Sergeant. - Chief Lugo. - We have a task force assembled but I want you and Intelligence to run your investigation. - Understood. - Right. Find the son of a bitch who did this. [footsteps approaching] I got a relief sergeant to cover the front desk - so I'm here to help. - Great. Uh, these are our 36 DOAs. And the 18 over there are in the ICU at Med. All right, thank you. All right, hey, that was a parole officer in East Garfield Park. She has an ex-con named Nathan Delano who did 18 years for arson and attempted homicide in Stateville because he lit his family on fire back in 1998. Including three of his own children. So this guy failed to report in yesterday. She marked him down for the violation, but his last known address was 4133 South Wells. That's six blocks from the Kimball Factory. There's a active warrant out for his arrest. Yeah. Let's go. Nathan Delano? Chicago PD! Open up! [shotgun cocks] 5021, Ida emergency. Shots fired at the police. 4133 South Ida. Advise responding, there are plain clothes officers on the scene. Ready, boys? Hey! All right. Many of the victims had only recently moved to Chicago. Family members are still arriving from around the country, heartbroken, searching for answers. [gunshots] Son of a bitch. [footsteps fleeing] Stop! [grunts] - Stay down! - [panting] Get off of me. - Pigs! Get off me! - Get up. Get up! That's not Delano. - Uh! - What's your name? Oh, no, no, no. [grunting] What is your problem? Lane Cromwell. He and Nathan Delano were cellmates - at Stateville for four years. - Mm. He's wanted on an extraditable felony warrant from St. Louis. He beat a cab driver half to death. Priors for unlawful restraint, aggravated battery, assaulting a police... you get the idea. Mm. Yeah, I'm gonna head back upstairs. - That's probably a good idea. - Uh-huh. You spit on that floor again, you're gonna be licking it back up, trust me. [door closes] Nathan Delano. Where is he? I know you know who I am. I know I'm going back to prison for the rest of my life. - So save it. - Hmm. You got nothing to offer me. That's a fair point. Fair point. But your little brother... what's his name again? Aaron. He's doing six years at Menard, isn't that right? Yeah, it says here he's in, uh, administrative segregation. Apparently he's having some problems in gen pop. I don't know, but, uh, judging by his intake photo, I'm guessing he's just... just a little too fetching. You can't touch him. - Oh, no? - No. You wanna hear something really funny? The warden at Menard used to be my Deputy Chief. Uh-huh. Yeah. See, his wife, she wanted to move out to the country, so he took the warden gig and she finally got her garden. So I'd say inside of 30 minutes, I could have your baby brother tossed in that yard like a little dog treat. [kisses] I don't know where Nathan is. He packed a bag real quick and drove off two minutes before your cop buddies rolled up. Did he torch that warehouse? Did he torch that warehouse? - I have no idea. - I wasn't there and I didn't ask. So why'd he blow off his check-in with his parole officer yesterday? He'd been using. He knew he wouldn't pass the piss test, so we were gonna skip town. Head up to Alaska, where a buddy of mine owns a fishing boat. Okay, what's he driving? What's he driving? Suit yourself. A '94 green Toyota. Stolen out of Wisconsin. Copy that. Thanks. Okay, Sarge, we got a statewide BOLO out there on Delano and the stolen Toyota. So here's what we're up against, boss. The warehouse was without any residential permits, so there's no records, no lease agreements, no video cameras and the person who knew the most was the owner, Barry Kimball, who shot himself in the face yesterday at Firehouse 51. Right, Delano's previous arson, he tried to kill his own family members. So it's a good bet if he's behind this one, he has some personal connection to someone inside. Hey, this is interesting. Barry Kimball took out additional commercial property insurance on the warehouse six months ago. He doubled his policy. Insurance scam? Somehow crosses paths with Delano and then gets him to torch the place. It says he has a live-in girlfriend, Stacia Mulaney. - We can check his apartment. - Do it. She almost came home. We had lunch last week. I said, you know, you've given this guy two years. It's time, you know, to pursue your own dreams. And so I went back that next day and she had her bag packed. So I opened the car door but, uh, she just shook her head. She was crying. You know, she couldn't leave him. "He needs me, Dad." [sighs] This is a nightmare. Yeah, for a lot of people. Barry was just trying to help. They were artists and musicians who couldn't afford regular rent. You know, they made a community there. Do either of these men look familiar to you? No. Why did Barry take out extra insurance on the warehouse - six months ago? - I don't know. He kept me out of that stuff. When he killed himself at the firehouse, he had an unregistered gun. Why would he be walking around with that? He was being threatened. - By who? - He didn't say, but he started to get really paranoid. Threatened about what? Money. I don't know. Like I said, Barry kept me out of all of that stuff. Okay, Stacia, I'm gonna ask you something and I'm only gonna ask once. Do you know who was after your boyfriend or who could have started that fire? No. Okay. Keep your phone on. Don't leave town. We'll be in touch. Yeah. [computer beeping] I got a hit. I ran the Wisconsin plate on Delano's stolen Toyota through NVLS plate reader and got two consecutive hits, both indicating the 3400 block of Pulaski. All right, Lindsay and Halstead should be right there. - Have them respond. - Yeah. Here. - [gunshots] - [grunting, shouting] Get out of the way! [grunts] - [grunts] - [horn blaring] Stop, police! [tires screeching] 5021 George. Armed offender fleeing westbound on 29th Street. Get me some cars! Out of the way! [grunts] Do not move! Let go of the gun. Let go of the gun. Let it go! 5021 George. Shots fired by the police. Offender is down. 4000 block of West 29th Street. - Roll an ambulance. - Copy that. Ambulance on the way. 5021 George's other half... can you tell that ambulance to kick it in the ass, please? Hey, partner, are you all right? Jay, are you there? Yeah, I'm fine. - 5021, squad be advised... - You're gonna be okay. Offender didn't make it. Copy that, 5021 George. We'll notify coroner. - Hey. - Oh, I got something. We were able to pull some video off one of the phones recovered from the warehouse. [indistinct chatter] [explosion booming] [screaming] Okay, back it up. That guy was leaving fast. Stop. Zoom in. That's our killer. Yep. We're up to 38. So based on the proximity of the suspect to the stairs... which we measured at the warehouse... he should be about 5'9, figure 150 pounds. And how tall was Delano? Oh, Delano was a little over six feet. [cell phone buzzing] Hey, guys, um, so there's gonna be a candlelight vigil tonight at the warehouse. At 8:00, FYI. So the block the warehouse is on. Strings signify security cameras from private companies and what angles they access. All right, I want footage going back one month. And I want access to all these cameras. - All right. - [phone chimes] Hey, it's my C.I. I'll be right back. - What's up, man? - What you got for me? Yeah, man, you know the dude who owned - the warehouse, Kimball? - Yeah. You know, we know each other 'cause I used to supply some folks who live in the warehouse. Right, right, right. I understand that, Rashad. That's why I called you. Well, he hit me up a couple weeks ago. Wanted me to take care of a situation for him. You know, turns out, these dudes were trying to shake him for some money. Wanted me to step in, intervene, - you know, do my thing. - Okay, wait, wait. When did I ask you for information - about the warehouse, Rashad? - This morning. Honestly, I think somewhere down the line, a miscommunication developed between us and I take full responsibility for that. I get it. But I'ma clarify for you right now. We in business, together. You work for me. You understand that? You give me information, I give you cash and keep your ass out of jail. - Yes or no? - Yes. Of course. Thirty-eight people died, Rashad. You can't slow walk this to me six hours later, bro. I swear on everything I love, if that happens again, your life is gonna change. - Do you copy me? - Copy. Now, you were saying. Look, this dude named K.D. was trying to shake Kimball down, man. - Mm-hmm. - That's all he told me. I never saw the dude. Just told me to be ready. He might about to put the ball in K.D.'s court. [alarm sounding] She's bradying down. Milligram of Atropine. It's not working. Get one of Epi. Heart rate, 20. She's a peri-arrest. Stats are down to single digits. [flatline sounding] - I can't get a pulse. - Asystole! Get on her chest. Start CPR. - Another dose of Epi, now. - [machine beeping] [speaking indistinctly] I'll be right back. Will. Now, I've had to give a lot of notifications to family over the years, so I know how hard it is. So you don't have to sugar coat anything for me. All right? Okay, so... is Lexi gonna make it? Her heart already stopped. And, uh, we were able to get it going again. She's in multi-organ failure. There's just nothing more we can do. I'm so sorry, Al. [flatline sounding] Lexi died 20 minutes ago. So we can mourn when the scumbag who did this is in cuffs. Till then, what do we got? - Mm? - Uh... yeah. Right... yeah. Um... The lab did an enhancement on the suspect leaving the warehouse. They were able to identify the logo on the right shoulder of the suspect's jacket. The brand is ForeRange. The cargo jacket looks like the one the suspect is wearing. There's five retail stores in Chicago that carry the brand. They're sending me the last six months of security footage and all their cash and their credit card transactions. All right, Kev, what's up with the tip you got on K.D.? Yeah, we got 85 registered gang bangers with those initials in our database. And I cross-referenced the initials K.D. with everyone who's contacted Kimball's phone. Nothing. These are all in-service calls and any paper generated on the warehouse. Most of the calls came from the same landline. Same woman. Claire Burke. She's made over 40 suspicious persons calls. The last was three nights ago and she lives down the block from the warehouse. You and Jay. This is how it always happens. Y'all don't show up until it hits the fan. Uh, Detectives Lindsay and Halstead. - Are you Claire Burke? - Yes. And before you leave, I wanna get the correct spelling of your names, your badge numbers, and what unit you're assigned to. Not a problem, ma'am. We're here about the warehouse fire. The gentleman who owned it was named Barry... I know who he is. And he packed them damn kids in there like sardines. Treated them about as good, too. Did you notice anything the night of the fire? - Anything suspicious? - The night before, I did. - Okay. - Barry had been having this heated conversation with another man, right down the street. I was sitting in that window, and I could see it all. This man kept thumping Barry's chest like this. And I told that old hair bag Officer Keating when he finally showed up 45 minutes later. But did Officer Keating follow up with me? Hell no. Okay, any other details about the man? White gentleman. Brown hair. A little shorter than you, looked like... How much shorter? Oh, so you interrupt people. - Sorry, ma'am. - I didn't have a measuring stick, so I can't say for sure. But he was in his 20s, though. And I got his license plate number. - Wrote it down. - Really? Any chance you have security cameras? What am I? Fort Knox? No, I don't have any damn security cameras. But I got eyeballs. And that guy had been by here three times to talk to Barry. He was bringing nothing but bad news. Next thing you know, 39 young people get called home way before their time. I'll go get you that license plate number. Appreciate it. Boss, ran the plate. Came back to a Kade Davis. - Kade Davis? - Yeah. 26 years old, 5'8, 170 pounds. No criminal history, though. - Get a photo array together. - Okay. Him. No doubt in my mind. Thank you very much for your help. Finally, a cop does something in this city. Lock him into the area, dump his phone, run his vehicle. I want everything on this prick before we move on him. Al. We're so sorry. Thanks. Well, listen. Let's get you home. - Be with Meredith. - No. Alvin, do you wanna get some coffee? Or maybe talk to the chaplain or... or Peer Support? No, I just wanna know what's going on with this case. Well, we're, uh, we're moving in on a suspect. But it's nothing rock solid yet. Okay. Yeah. - Hi, how are you? - I'm great. Thanks for asking. Do you have a reservation? It's all good. I'm looking for the Davis party and I'm wondering if they're here. - Yes. - Don't look. Just tell me where they are. By the window. He's having dinner with a pretty Asian woman. Thank you. Stay right here. - Kade Davis. - Can I help you? Yeah. You need to stand up for me. I'd like to know what this is about. - What's the problem here? - Back up. - We can keep this civil. - I'm not going anywhere... The hell do you think you're doing? Hands up. - Huh. - [laughs] - [handcuffs ratcheting] - Where you taking me? Where do you think? Move your ass. - [chuckles] - Let's ride. Al. Al! - What? - Hey. Hey, you can't go in there, buddy. I'm just gonna watch, man. Hang back. No, but just... Look, the observation room, that's it. I got it. Come on, man. Huh. Quite the family tree you got. [door closes] So your Uncle Patty, he was a Ward Superintendant till he got swept up in Operation Silver Shovel for felony theft and racketeering. The paperwork says he flipped on a couple of aldermen for a reduction in sentence. Your cousin, Finn. One time city inspector. He got pinched for bribes, money laundering, threatening a witness. What am I doing here? Barry Kimball. Don't know him. Hmm. So... you're gonna deny to my face knowing or interacting with Barry Kimball, whose warehouse got torched. That's what I said. [grunts] Here's what I think went down: You tried to squeeze money out of Kimball. Told him you'd rat him out to the city 'cause you have connections. And he refused to pay or he stopped paying. So you went back to your dirtbag relatives for advice and they told you you had to get tough. So you went back to that warehouse during that rave and you torched that place. I... Kid... if the next thing out of your face is, "I don't know Barry Kimball," we're gonna go for a ride. All right. I squeezed Kimball for money. He wouldn't pay. And yeah, I had people in my ear telling me what the next level should be, but it wasn't arson. And no way did I light that place up. I didn't start that fire. You look all you want. [clattering] Yeah, your brother operated on Lexi. So please tell him I said thanks. I know he gave it everything he had. - I will. - Yeah. Yeah. All right, I want a full work-up on this guy. Search his apartment. Let's tie him - to that brown ForeRange jacket. - Okay. That was patrol. Tamra Collins just woke up in the ICU at Med. And she wants to talk. All right. Kim, you go with. Oh. Sweetheart, the police are here. Hi, Tamra. My name is Erin Lindsay and Kim Burgess is here, as well. You had something you wanted to tell us. Yes. I was there at the rave. And this guy stood... stood next to me. He was wearing a dark jacket and a... and a hat. And he was holding a paper bag. He walked over to the side and he... he dropped the paper bag on the floor. And then stepped on it. Then he kicked it behind the couch. He... he started to walk away and then the bag burst into flames. Do you remember anything else about him? Uh, he was a little bit taller than me. So, 5'8, maybe. And a white guy. In his 20s. He had a... a silver skull ring on his right hand. I... I noticed it when he wiped his eyebrow. That's really good. Is there anything else, or... Yeah, he... he had blue eyes. Blue? Are you sure? [crying] When he looked at me, it was like he was looking right through me. Thank you. All right, we're looking for a male, white, 20-25, owns a brown ForeRange cargo jacket. He wears a silver skull ring on his right hand, he's about 5'8, and he has blue eyes. We'll run everyone in the city with that description. All DMV, city, county, and state employees, anyone with a public record. Kick Kade Davis? Charge him with the gun first. So we're nowhere. You got that vigil in an hour, Sarge. All right, everybody get ready. I've got someone. Male, white, dark beanie, moving to my right. - That one, there. - Right there. Halstead, coming to you, brother. Headed north. I got eyes. He's going westbound down the alley. Yeah, you can stop right there. [gun cocks] Put him in the cage. Dylan Oates, 22. He's got an apartment on 8th. Call Felony Review, get a warrant. Chicago PD! It's clear. Clear. Jay. In here. Metal wedges. [sighs] I work with a detective... I mean, he's a... he's a really good friend of mine. You killed his daughter in that fire. I mean, I knew her her whole life. She was... just one of those people, made the world a better place. I mean, she just... she had a glow. A chief at CFD, he told me arsonists like to return to the scene of the crime, but I had a real strong hunch you would anyway. Because I know this crime was personal. You wanted to hurt someone 'cause someone hurt you. Tell me if I'm wrong. [grunts] Tell me if I'm wrong! So who was it? Hmm? Who pissed you off, huh? Who broke your little heart? I have the right to remain silent. I understand that right and I do not wish to speak with you. You're gonna tell me why you lit that fire. Believe me. Or you're gonna feel pain like you never imagined was possible. - I have the right to remain... - Which you have! - Al, Al, Al! Al, come on, Al. - Get off me! - Come on, let me... - Come on, Al! - Get off me! Get off me! - Al. Al! Come on, man! - Get off me. Come on. - Al, come on, man. - Get off me! - Hey, it's okay, we're good. - Door's locked, we're good. - Hank, take a walk, man. - Give me the keys. - Al. - Give me the keys! - Al, listen to me. I'm gonna turn him over to the state's attorney... - No, we're not! - Yes, we are! - No, we're not. - Look, it's killing me. - But it's the only way, Al. - Hey, when Justin was killed, what did you do? Huh? Would you have let anybody stop you if they tried? We got 39 families looking for justice, not just one. Oh, so you don't think that they'd be happy to hear that this animal was dredged out of the river? I don't know that! I don't know that, and neither do you. And that's why it's gotta go down this way. - Give me the keys. - I can't do that, Al, - I'm sorry. - I'm warning you, man. Well, then you're gonna have to go through me to get him out. - Go ahead. - [door opens] Al. Heard you had a suspect. Wanted to check in. - There he is. - He confessed. - Okay. To who? - Me. [indistinct chatter, jeering] What can you tell us about him? His name is Dylan Oates. He's 22 years old. - We heard he confessed. - No comment. Why'd he do it, Mr. Stone? Pyromaniacs don't need a reason. The fact is, Mr. Oates has asserted his Fifth Amendment rights, so I haven't spoken to him as of yet. But he's the guy? Yes, he is. - Does he have an attorney? - Is he from Chicago? Officer Stone, does he have a record? [camera shutters clicking] [pensive music] ♪ ♪ We don't usually get to see you at a bond hearing, Mr. Stone. But this isn't your garden variety homicide. Where's your attorney, son? I don't have one. Excuse me, judge, but this is just about whether or not I get bail, right? That is correct. Then it doesn't really matter, does it? - I waive counsel. - Hang him! - Burn him! - You killed my boy! [indistinct shouting] [gavel pounds] No bail it is. Next case. See you in hell! [indistinct shouting] You don't want to know how many cases with confessions I've seen crash and burn. You may want to add this to the pile. Voight says he confessed. But you have your doubts. Haven't heard from Dawson yet, but Olinsky's kid died in the fire. But a girl did ID the suspect. - She saw him set the fire? - Yes. And she picked him out of a lineup? She's having trouble with her vision. But she described his ring and his coat. He was wearing both when he was arrested. - Why? - Because he's a monster. Someone kills 39 kids and injures God knows how many more, you're damn right he's a monster. The problem is juries can't accept it. It's out of their comfort zone. But you give them a big, fat, juicy "why" and they'll crawl into their beds, close their eyes, and drift off, thinking they're actually safe. I'll put Dawson and Nagel on it. Oh, and, Peter... Enormous tragedies make career cases. You win this one, it could make your career. But you lose, it could destroy mine. Hey. Hey, man. I'm so sorry. Yeah. I loved Lexi. We all did. Domestic monitors. Can you believe this crap? Like I'm gonna hurt my own kid. I'm sorry for your loss, Al. Walk with me for a second. You know, the thing is, sometimes guys in your position might get hit by a bout of ethics and then there's some pain-in-the-ass defense attorney crying coercion. Good. Did he confess, Al? That son of a bitch... he killed Lexi. [melancholy music] ♪ ♪ Jesus. How bad am I, complaining about my kid issues? I honestly don't know how he's gonna make it through the day. All I know is I couldn't. So was that the sound of the vice squeezing? You wanna ask me something, go ahead. On a good day, a confession from your old crew smells a little hinky. With Olinsky's kid a victim... I don't know, okay? I wasn't there so I didn't hear anything. Hey, I'm a team player, is all. I'd just like to know which team I'm on before the game starts. [indistinct shouting] Uh-uh, back up. No comment. Come on. This is all a shock. I'm sorry. James! I just can't get those poor children out of my head. What you must think of us... Dylan couldn't have done this. - Why do you say that? - We're good people. James, these people are investigators from the State's Attorney's office. You can't talk to us. We have rights. Actually, you don't until someone accuses you of something. Yeah, we'll see about that. Did Dylan go to the party with anyone? I don't really know who his friends are. I doubt he would even go to a rave. When are these pricks gonna leave us alone? Unfortunately, they have rights. Why did you say that Dylan wouldn't go to a rave, Mrs. Oates? He kept to himself, mostly. His head was always in his computer. Eight hours a day wasn't enough for him. He was a programmer? Data processing. Whatever that is. [knock at door] Hey. What'd you find? He's snooty. He's weird. He's shy. He'd "never go dancing." Nobody seems to know a lot about him. But he spends a lot of time online. Unfortunately, none of that is an element of murder. Right. You don't have kids, do you? No. I remember when I could hold Diego in the palm of my hand. I'd look at him and think, "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls." I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be. [sighs] The confession... I didn't actually hear it. Who did? Voight and Olinsky. [sighs] You know, truth be told, I was waiting for you to come to me. I just didn't expect it would take you 24 hours. Olinsky's daughter died in that fire. I figured maybe he's entitled... - To what? Revenge? - Yeah. One lie like this can destroy my entire case. Your case? It's his kid. Fine. Albert Forest made a motion to suppress the confession. Albert Forest is representing Dylan? Today's just brimming with good news. Excuse me. Fancy seeing you here. I knew a guy... ate a hot dog a day, lived to be 98. I doubt it was the hot dog. He swears it was. I trust him. You should trust me. We'll see. Peter, let me do this. I got a right to take the stand and tell my story, whatever it is. Having a right and doing what is right, they're two completely different things. For what it's worth, Hank, I'm truly sorry for your loss. It's your show, Mr. Forest. That won't be necessary. The People will not oppose Mr. Forest's motion to suppress the defendant's confession to the police. It's nice Mr. Stone recognizes the weaknesses in his case. Perhaps he'd consider... The People intend to proceed to trial, Your Honor. So be it. [gavel bangs] Peter, I found something odd. It was in with Forest's response for discovery call us today. and the documents his office sent over. Looks like a list of Internet articles about the Kimball Factory. It was probably sent to us by mistake. A big one. Look closer. The one that's circled. "Kimball Factory: A Kiddie Sex Den"? The article was posted a few weeks ago on "The Anders Report." I printed it out. The Anders website claims the factory was a haven for pedophiles. They threw the raves to attract underage teens. I spoke to a shrink, and apparently, one of the possible consequences of child abuse is pyromania. [tense music] ♪ ♪ You wanted a motive. Now we have one. I don't know. Dylan Oates was a victim of sexual abuse. He read the article, it brought back memories, and he lost it. [sighs] This could be considered attorney work product. What do you want me to do? I can't un-see it. This is a good thing, Mark. At least we know what Forest is thinking. You'd be handing Forest a sympathy defense on a silver platter with that. If he was going to assert an affirmative defense, he would have done it already and I would get to cross-examine Dylan about every second of that night, about every innocent person that died because of him. The last thing Forest wants is for the sympathy pendulum to swing back to me. No. No, no, no, no. We've got 39 grieving families out there. This case is too damned important to risk playing lawyer games. Now you've got real facts on your side. Use them. We found the remains of the incendiary device inside the warehouse. What kind of incendiary device? It was a light bulb filled with gasoline and a mixture of quartz and diatomaceous silica. It's kitty litter. - Sounds simple. - It is. You can learn everything you need to know just by going online. What else did you find in the warehouse? We found metal wedges that had been jammed into the doorways of the warehouse. What did that tell you? Somebody didn't want the people inside to get out. Tell me about Barry Kimball. He was the owner of the factory that burned. Was Mr. Kimball's factory in violation of the Fire Code? There weren't fire doors. And four years ago, he was ordered to retrofit the wiring, and he ignored the order. Did you speak to him about these violations? He came to the Firehouse the day after the fire. I wasn't there, but my crew spoke with him. Right after Mr. Kimball spoke with your crew, he went into the men's room and he shot himself, isn't that right? Yes. Is that because he felt guilty? - Objection. - Sustained. Mr. Forest. I-I saw a guy drop a paper bag on the floor. What did he do after he dropped the paper bag? He stepped on it hard, and then he kicked it under the couch. And then he just left. I thought it was weird. What's the next thing you remember? I looked to go see what it was. And then there was this... this flash of light. And then I went down. Can you describe him? He was 5'8". Blonde, blue eyes. Could you describe what he was wearing? He was wearing a... a brown cargo jacket with a ForeRange logo on it. - Was there anything else? - Yeah, he was... He was wearing a ring. Can you describe the ring? It was silver. It was like a skull made of silver. Thank you. Tamra, were you drinking that night? I had... I had two beers. Did you consume any drugs? [somber music] ♪ ♪ You have to answer the question, Tamra. - Yes. - What kind of drugs? I had a half tab of Molly. But I saw what I saw. Was there music playing? - Yes. - Any kind of light show? They had... they had strobe lights. And how long did you see this person, the one who stepped on the paper bag? Maybe three seconds. So in a crowded room, after you'd been drinking and popping pills with music pumping and lights pulsating, you were really able to see and identify a ring on the finger of a stranger? I saw it. And his face. I'll never forget it. But, unfortunately, you're not able to identify my client as the man you saw that night, are you? No, I can't. I can't see anything because of him. ♪ ♪ We found metal wedges in the defendant's apartment. Were they manufactured by Elliston Industries? Yes. Stainless steel. 1 5/8 inch slot width. Like this? Exactly. Can you describe the wedges shoved under the door at the factory where the rave took place? Stainless steel. 1 5/8 inch slot width. Manufactured by Elliston Industries. - Like this? - Yes, sir. People use these wedges to hold doors open, isn't that right? Or closed, as the case may be. Say you wanted to keep your terrace door open so you could enjoy the summer breeze while you ate dinner. You'd use one? Well, I don't have a terrace, so I wouldn't know. One of the victims in this case is the daughter of one of your colleagues, - isn't that right? - Alvin Olinsky. His daughter Lexi was killed by the fire. And getting someone, anyone, convicted for what happened to Detective Olinsky's daughter would bring him some sort of closure, wouldn't it? - Objection. - Withdrawn. I show you what is marked Defense Exhibit 12. Do you recognize that? It's my arrest report. Would you read the highlighted part? "After advising suspect of his Miranda rights, "he stated of his own free will, 'It was me, okay. I started the damn fire.'" It's curious, don't you think, that the People haven't entered that statement into evidence? - Objection! - I'm curious too, Mr. Stone. Overruled. Why haven't the People entered Mr. Oates' statement - into evidence, Detective? - You'd have to ask the People. Could it be that they didn't trust you? And if the Assistant State's Attorney doesn't trust you with something as simple as a confession, why should we trust anything you say now? Exactly. ♪ ♪ In person, Forest is a lot better than his book. We read it in law school. - The Third Edition? - Thank you. No, the Fifth. Could you do it? Defend someone like Dylan Oates. I won't ever have to make that decision. So you are a lifer? I was thrilled when I was drafted by the Cubs, Anna. Back when they were the "lovable losers." An underdog always needs someone on his side. Representing the State doesn't exactly make you the underdog. When I'm in that courtroom, I'm not thinking about the State of Illinois. I'm thinking about the victims. And right now, I'm letting 39 of them down. Forest is well on his way to establishing reasonable doubt. I don't have a choice. I can't win this without offering a motive. If you put Anders on the stand to testify about the raves being used for underage sex, Forest will go ballistic. Let him. Ah, Mr. Anders, thank you for coming in on a Saturday. This won't take long. I'm sure you don't need much prep. I don't think I'll need any. Mainly 'cause I'm not gonna testify. You have a subpoena in your hand. And the First Amendment and the shield law at my back. I am a journalist, after all. I don't know what it is you do exactly, but I wouldn't call it journalism. Be that as it may, I'm not getting on the stand. We could have you arrested for contempt. Speaking of which, I was just thinking recently of a weekend you spent at the Huntington Hotel in Grand Beach. When was that, four years ago? Why are you doing this? What are you so scared of? Do you have any idea what it would cost me to defend the lawsuits brought by the 39 families who lost their kids? They'd have to prove your story wasn't true. Then I'd be forced to name my sources. Give my best to Joan. [sighs] Damn it, Peter. We had a deal. No calls, no texts. And definitely no lunches. Like I said, this is important. How bad is it? You heard of Todd Anders? - The sleazy website guy? - Yeah. He threatened to publish something about our weekend at Grand Beach if I put him on the stand. Well, then don't put him on the stand. This is on the rave trial, Joan. His testimony will help me establish motive. I said no. - Thirty-nine kids died. - And I'm married. You were separated at the time. I doubt that Sam or the girls will split those hairs. You're not asking my permission, are you? I'm sorry. No, you're not. You only care about your damn case. Joan, please. You're gonna ruin my life, Peter. Pardon me if I don't want to break bread with you. ♪ ♪ Mr. Anders. I direct your attention to what is being offered as People's Exhibit 53. Do you recognize this document, Mr. Anders? It is an article that was published on my website. Please read the headline. "Kimball Factory: A Kiddie Sex Den." And the essence of the story is what? That people threw parties at the abandoned factory to lure underage teens to engage in sexual acts. They'd get them drunk and high? That's right. If someone read this, might they do something drastic about it? - I'm not gonna answer that. - Nor should you have to. I have nothing more, Your Honor. - Mr. Forest? - No questions. No questions, Your Honor. Mr. Stone? The People rest. Fine, gentlemen. The defense can present in the morning. Are you okay? [sighs] I've been better. Forest didn't object to the document or my question to Anders. He didn't cross Anders about his sources. Why? Maybe Anders has something on him. It's a little late for Forest's book. Read the title of chapter three. "Trials: It's All A Con." And I think I'm his mark. I never thought Dylan could do something like this. But you do now? No. Of course not. He was always such a sweet boy. That's what I called him, my Sweet Boy. [voice breaking] I know it's silly. Was there a time when he stopped being sweet? Dylan was five. My brother Frank was taking him fishing. He was so excited, you know, like little boys get. When he got home... he was different. - You're lying. - Watch it, young man. I know what he did to you. From the time he was five until Frank died. She's lying! She knows nothing about me! Mr. Oates, one more outburst and I will have you removed. Did Dylan say anything about it to you? No. Then how can you be so sure it happened, Mrs. Oates? I'm his mother. Are you aware that you just confessed to endangering the welfare of a child? That fire, all those kids... If Dylan did it, it is my fault. Not his. Let's break for lunch, shall we? [melancholy music] ♪ ♪ [indistinct chatter] I assume this isn't a coincidence. It's all a con. [chuckles] Well, at least somebody pays attention to what I write. "In the courtroom, reality is irrelevant. The appearance of reality is all that matters." I do have a way with words. That wasn't a mistake, you sending me that list of articles. Why would I do that intentionally? So I would introduce your defense for you. And you'd never have to put your client on the stand to be cross-examined. Wow. That would be very clever. And dishonest. Or the appearance thereof. Was Dylan really abused? His mother certainly thinks so. No. I read the transcript of her testimony. She never actually said it. So you never actually suborned perjury. Jeez, I'm getting smarter by the minute. Is the Anders story true? I have no idea. For me it was merely fortuitous. This isn't a game. Thirty-nine kids are dead. And my concern is the one who's still living. You got a little of your dad in you, you know that? You think a criminal trial is all about some sort of ineffable morality. There's something out there that's permanent and infinite. I've got news for you, son: ain't no such thing. What happens in that courtroom is a zero sum game. There's winners and losers, period. So why concern yourself with using a fake news story as long as it puts a W in your column? Or at least an M for mistrial. Odds are, out of the 12 ordinary citizens in the jury box, child sexual abuse will hit home for one of them. And that, my friend, spells hung jury. I'll retry him. And I'll find another reality. Maybe even one that's more acceptable to my client. The People have no questions for Mrs. Oates. You may go. Thank you. In that case, the defense rests, Your Honor. I think counsel is jumping the gun. The People certainly have the right to examine Mr. Oates. [chuckles] This is still America. We still have a constitution and a Fifth Amendment... Your Honor, let me remind you how the defendant reacted when his mother was on the stand. Your Honor, may we approach? Yes. Come. Your Honor, my client was upset. He spoke. The jury heard him. That's testimony. He waived his rights against self-incrimination. - Your Honor... - Clever, Mr. Stone. Very clever. I'll probably be reversed on appeal, but I'm gonna let you cross-examine him, but only as to the matters that he testified to on direct. I assume you're gonna need time to prepare your client, Mr. Forest. I'll give you 24 hours. All you can cross Dylan on is whether his mom was lying or whether she actually knew anything about his life. So, we need to find out something she didn't know. Somebody at the rave must have known him. CPD spoke to everybody who came forward. Have Dawson and Nagel find someone who didn't. - Hey. - Hey. Did you tell Stone about the confession? I didn't have to. You know, I should have whacked that little bastard when I had the chance. Hey, Dawson. Look what I found on this teddy. "Dear Arnie, I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. Love always, Chloe." There's no Chloe on the survivors list. Who's Arnie? There was an Arnold Phillips. He died in the fire. Okay. Hey, Chloe. - Who are you? - I'm Laura. I'm investigating the fire. Your mom said I could come up. She's talking to my partner. It's important, Chloe. This could help us convict the guy responsible. I wasn't there. I don't know anything. I have a daughter. She's eight. And I know in a few years, she's gonna start keeping secrets from me. Can you leave me alone? [cries] I know you were there. And I know how difficult it must be to lose a brother. Arnie didn't want to go. I was a jerk. I kept begging him. And then when I saw the guy they arrested on the news, I didn't know what to do. You recognized him? Yeah. When I went outside to have a cigarette, he was out there, pacing back and forth. And then when I went in, he was arguing with some girl. I want you to tell me if you recognize her. No. Yeah. That's her. Yeah. Thank you. I don't know a Dylan Oates. He seems to know you. Our tech people found that Dylan had a Facebook account under the fake name Kurt Holden. I have over a thousand "friends." I don't know all of them. Dylan only friended one person, Tamra... you. We know you saw him do more than just step on the paper bag. Oh, God... [sighs] He came up to me at the rave. He said he knew me, that we'd met on the L, like, three months ago. But I had no idea. He said that he asked me to have a cup of coffee back then. - Did you go out with him? - No. I had to study. That's what he said I told him. But I swear, I don't remember this at all. What else did he tell you, Tamra? He said that I went to a party instead of going out with him. But how could he possibly know that? You posted it on Facebook. [voice breaking] Oh, God... [sobbing] All those people are dead because of me, aren't they? I'm sorry, Tamra, but you'll have to testify... Only if we need you. We'll show ourselves out. Why did you call your mother a liar? - Part of what we do* - That story about my uncle, it's a total lie. He never did anything weird to me. So why would your mom say it under oath? 'Cause she's stupid. [scoffs] Did you think boys were being molested - at the Kimball Warehouse? - Objection. - Beyond the scope. - Sustained. Did you ever read an article about it in "The Anders Report"? - Same objection. - Sustained. Mr. Stone, you're limited to questions relating to the defendant's prior outburst. Tell me, Dylan, why did you say that your mom doesn't know anything about your life? Because she doesn't. Did she know you were on Facebook? [laughs] I'm not. I mean, it's lame. So why did you start an account under the fake name "Kurt Holden"? I have no idea what you're talking about. Did your mom know you were obsessed with a girl on social media? Even if I were, I wouldn't tell her. Do you know who this girl is? No. How about this one? No. Who is that, Dylan? She's the blind one who said she knows me. Her name is Tamra Collins. And her face was all over the newsfeed on your phony account. These were photos that you liked. [somber music] ♪ ♪ Looks like she's having a great time. ♪ ♪ Whatever. Did this make you a little jealous? - Objection. - Withdrawn. Did your mom know that you asked Tamra out three months ago? No. Because I didn't. Did she know that Tamra made up some lame excuse to dump you while she went to a rave? No. Because that never happened. Did you ever tell your mom how humiliated you felt? Why would I care if some bimbo preferred to be with garbage instead of me? So you'd just as soon sit at home alone on your computer? As a matter of fact, I would. To hell with Tamra and her friends, right? That's right. They're all irrelevant to me. So it's no big deal that they're all dead? - Objection. - Withdrawn. I have nothing further, Your Honor. Why did he do it? I don't know either. Mr. Stone told you a hell of story about light bulbs and kitty litter, door wedges, brown cargo jackets, but, unless I missed it, he never quite told you why Dylan Oates started a fire at a party filled with people he didn't know. But the truth is, is that a lot of people have light bulbs and kitty litter, door wedges, brown cargo jackets. But only one had the motive to cause such unutterable devastation. Was it Dylan Oates? Or did Mr. Stone merely pull a patsy out of a hat? A patsy who happened to have a brown cargo jacket? A patsy whose childhood was tormented by such unspeakable indignities he would risk going to prison rather than admit what really happened. Now if it was Dylan Oates who started that fire, surely Mr. Stone would have answered that one simple, crucial question. Why? Thirty-nine children dead. Mr. Forest is correct. I didn't tell you why Dylan Oates set that fire and killed these 39 innocents. I didn't have to because Dylan told you himself. He said it here. And here. And here. He said it the way people say most things today... digitally, by text or Twitter or Tumblr or Facebook. He told you he was obsessed with Tamra Collins, a woman he met only briefly but still wanted nothing to do with him. He stalked her, not by following her home or to work, but on social media. Why? Because that's the world Dylan Oates inhabits. The rectangular bordered landscape of his desktop, laptop, iPad, smartphone. A world where someone, with a couple of keystrokes, can express anger, love, hate to anyone anywhere without risk of reprisal. It's a world where deceit flourishes and voyeurism thrives. Where real human contact and discourse is replaced by bits and bytes and logarithms. Where Tamra Collins is always smiling, always at a party, and always having a great time. Mr. Oates, that's enough. ♪ ♪ Continue, counselor. See, in Dylan's head, Tamra had... a perfect life. And Dylan wasn't invited. How dare she exclude you from her perfect world? How dare she embarrass you by announcing to the world on Facebook that you weren't part of it? See, Dylan couldn't let her get away with that, so he set fire to the world that didn't want him. And then he watched it burn. Now I wonder, are those tears for the 39 dead? Or are they for your own sad and lonely life? - [shouts] - Officers! - Dylan! Dylan! - Restrain him. - Dylan! - [gavel pounds] Order in this court. - Mr. Oates. - [gavel pounds] Mr. Oates, that's enough. Officers, remove him from this courtroom. [crowd murmuring] In the matter of the People versus Dylan Oates, on the First Count, Aggravated Arson, the jury finds the defendant guilty. On the Second Count, First Degree Murder of Isabel Acuna, guilty. On the Third Count, First Degree Murder of Dana Altamore, guilty. On the Fourth Count, First Degree Murder of Lexi Olinksy, guilty.
