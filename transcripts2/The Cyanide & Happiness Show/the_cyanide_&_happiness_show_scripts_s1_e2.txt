 Onward, men! We can't turn back now! Captain, we can't go further! The sea is a furious mistress tonight! (screaming) - Help me! - I'm begging you, Captain! - Help me! - I'm begging you, Captain! - Help me, please! - Turn us around! - Help me, please! Stop this madness! Never! I will not give up! I will not rest! Not until we find... The buttshark. Wait, what? The buttshark. A... butt-shark. The buttshark! Half shark, an' half butt. Terror of the deep! There's no such thing as a buttshark. You weren't there, boy! You didn't see the cruelty of the sea! You didn't witness the hellish beast which emerged from her dark blue belly! (breathes heavily) We hunted the buttshark for many months. (muttering) Buttshark... My Captain, the men are starving! We have little water left. We must stop off and replenish our supplies. Nay! The last time we stopped at shore, all but a handful of me crew abandoned ship! Well, that's because you're crazy, sir. Crazy!? Is it crazy to hunt something as foul and tortured as the buttshark? Yeah, but... You're just kind of making it personal, man. It is personal! The buttshark has taken everything from me. It took me wife. It took me only son. And it took... me butt. Are you serious? Serious as scurvy, m'lad! It took... your butt? Okay, I've gotta go. I'm sorry, man. Sit back down, child! And be thankful that yer can sit at all. Whoa. I was wondering why you were wearing assless chaps. 'Tis because I am an assless chap! Hey! I'm back! Shh! What happened next? Many weeks later, our hunt was still fruitless. (vomits) our hunt was still fruitless. our hunt was still fruitless. The men were growing weak, but we pressed onward. I had but one mission: to kill the buttshark. You're, ah, narrating again there, Captain. Aye, just practicing. Look! It's the buttshark! Narg. 'Tis but a dicksquid. (sighs) It's useless, Captain. Stop the search! It's destroying you! Half your crew is dead! Naye, perhaps it is time to— Wait! There! That's your first mate. He's dead, too. I will avenge him... By killing the buttshark. (grumbles) That last part, I didn't witness. 'Tis a literary device. You're such a good story-teller. Thanks! So then, other stuff happened and the ship was going down. Captain! She's going down, sir! We must get to the dinghy! Arr. What's the point? My life is without meaning or purpose. I have failed my pursuit. But we all had a really good time, right? I mean, mmm, most of us died, but at least the rest of us have a pretty neat story to tell. Aye! A story! I must warn others not to pursue their obsessions to the point of madness! Let it not ruin them as it has runined me! Pursue your dreams, me lad! But don't let them pursue you. For a dream can soon become a nightmare. I lost everything that night. I lost me ship, me crew, and me mind. Now I'm broken and penniless, with only myself to blame. Wow. Well, thank you for telling me your story. I... wait! If you're penniless, how can you afford these drinks? I can't! (laughs hysterically) Oh, god damn it! (laughs hysterically) Well, I'm done! (slurps) (sighs) Today's the day! I've got the ring, I've got the girl. Here's hoping she says "yes"! Wow, this is really great. Thanks for taking me out tonight, sweetie. I heard such good things about this place, I had to take you! (laughs nervously) Wow! Look at that chandelier! Yeah, it's really cool. (sighs) Anyway, there's a reason I— Oh my god! Yes! Yes! (kissing) Wow! That's so romantic! I— Did you just drink my wine? Uh, er... Yeah. Um, why? I'm an alcoholic. What!? Yep. Okay, no big deal. Just gotta try something else. See? You don't need alcohol to have a good time! Yeah, you're right. (laughs nervously) (sighs) Look, uh, baby... There's something I wanna— Shh! Look! Look, baby, there's something I wanna ask you. Will you marry me? Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! (kissing) (more than kissing) Why can't you be that romantic? I, er, uh, f— (stammering) Isn't this great? It's beyond great. It's absolutely incredible. I love you! (laughs nervously) I love you too! Oh my god, is that..? Yes, I— No, over there! Look! What? No! (gasps) Yes! Yes, of course I'll marry you! Damn it! No! No! No! What is wrong with you!? (stammering) You can't— You can't just— Can't what? It's not fair, I— How dare you! - I was— How dare you! How dare you! How dare you!? No, no, no! No, listen to me! You listen to me! I didn't come all the way up here to the sky for people like you - You don't— You don't understand! for people like you for people like you To get all up in my business! What? No! Get out of my sky! We come up here to be alone... No, no, no, no, no! You don't— and get away from... I was— people like you! No, y-y-you don't understand, I— No, you don't understand! You don't understand our love! (groans) What's your problem? Hey, sweetie, I'm— (screams) H... Hello? What... What is this? Hello, dear. In this room I've hidden something very special. If you want to find it, you'll need to play a little game with me. Kind of like Saw? Wh— What's Saw? It's a movie. God damn it! Gah, fuck... Look honey, I... I-I love you so much, and I've... I've been trying a million different ways to ask you to marry me, but... but they've all been done before, and... (sighs) All I wanted to do was give you something special to remember. Oh, sweetie... It doesn't matter how you propose! I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. (inhales) You do? Yes! I don't care if you're a homophobic alcoholic! Let's get married! You've made me the happiest man in the world! (laughter) (both sigh) So, um... How do I get outta here? Uh... You have to... go through... the whole... thing... Oh. And that's how my fianceé died. Yar. 'Tis a sad story. But I've got a sadder one. Two whiskeys!
