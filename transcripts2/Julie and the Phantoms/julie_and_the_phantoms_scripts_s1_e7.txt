 [whimsical music plays] [rock guitar riff plays] [tense mystical music plays] You can't hide forever, ghosties. -[beeping] -Gotcha! [aunt gasps] For the last time, mijo. Ghosts are not real. Typical adult. Remember when we were kids, and they never believed what we said? Yeah. I'm pretty sure that's just a "you" thing.

 I was always pretty trustworthy. Shouldn't we be more worried about Julie? Her dad just busted her, OK? He's probably making her quit the band. Well, there's not much we can do about that now, but... we can still help Carlos. Adults not believing children ends tonight. -Showtime. -[Carlos] I haven't seen them. I-- [aunt gasps] Ghosts aren't real, huh? How do you explain that? Light bulbs burn out all the time, Carlos. Ooh! Wrong answer, tía. Explain... this. [aunt breathes shakily] Maybe it's my mom.

 She knows I haven't been replacing the toilet paper! Your mama would never scare us. This is the work of a demon! Hey, words hurt. Wait! I got to get it on video. Yeah, you do. Time for an old classic. -[aunt squeals] -[Carlos] Oh! -[squeals] -Dang, it was in selfie mode. [aunt screams] [Reggie snickers] Whew! [sighs] Do you have any idea what you've done? Yeah, I do. I've defended every kid who's never been believed. Some might say I'm a superhero. We should probably hide before Julie finds out, huh? Julie, we need to talk. [Julie sighs] So, after skipping school, missing a test, you decided to sneak out even though I told you to go to your room and study? I know. -I'm sorry. -Yeah, you keep saying that. If you'd just... [tuts] ...let me in, I could've been excited about tonight instead of having this conversation we both hate. Why didn't you tell me you were in a band? It all just happened so fast. These last couple of weeks have changed my life. When I play music, I feel so much closer to mom. And I love that. You know I do. But your tía is right. School needs to come first. I know, but without the band, I would've never made it back into the music program. They played with me when I was trying to earn back my spot. They did? I think this is my thing, Dad. Well... I'd be a jerk of a dad if I took that away from you. Look, if you're gonna stay in this band, you need to keep up with school, and you need to keep me in the loop. Really? Yeah. Thanks, Papa. [chuckles] Hey, so that lady at your show, she was, like, some sort of manager, right? Could've been a big deal. Who knows? Hopefully, she'll get to see us play again. -Which I will tell you about. -Oh. Yeah, you will, 'cause if I ever catch you trying to sneaking out again, or if your grades slip, I'm gonna pull the plug. Or whatever it is that makes those holograms work. [chuckles] Do I ever get to meet these guys? Probably not. They don't even live here. It's... kind of confusing. But being seen really isn't their thing. You kids and technology. It's... [chuckles] ...definitely beyond me. Definitely beyond something. [dad] Well, whoever and, uh, wherever they are, they brought my little niña back, so as far as I'm concerned, they're like angels to me. [aunt pants] Whoa... [speaks Spanish] This house is haunted! We have got to go. Now! What happened? Victoria, I know you want us to move, but this is a little extreme. -I... I told you, we're OK. -I'll let Carlos explain what happened. He refuses to leave, but if movies have taught me anything, when a house is haunted, you run. [speaking Spanish] [sighs] [dad] ♪ I got a spark in me ♪ ♪ Hands up if you can see ♪ [Reggie joins in] ♪ When you're a part of me ♪ ♪ Hands up if you're with me ♪ ♪ I got a spark in me, hands up... ♪ -Hands up, yeah. -This is new. Yeah. I was in the mood for cooking some breakfast. [giggles] He thought you were talking to him. Me and your dad are pals now. It's a little one-sided, but it works. [dad] Look, after the talk we had the other night, I was thinking that I may have cost you an opportunity with that manager. -So, I was thinking-- -Dad, no. I should've never snuck out. Let the man speak. He's been stress eating all week. I don't know where he puts it though. It's, like... firm. I know, but I really want to support your band, so I called in some favors, and I booked you a local gig. Best dad ever! What? Oh my gosh. Where? Did you call your buddy from Drakes? Not quite. I called Flynn, and she's gonna help us throw a party. Here. Tonight. Oh! So you booked us a gig at our house? Maybe I was early with the "Best Dad Ever" award. All right. Hear me out. You invite some of your friends over, you play with your band, and I'll get some colleagues to put you on film. That way, you have something professional for your YouTube. [chuckles] You'd do that for me? Yeah. Back to "best dad ever." I'll go tell the guys. Have a good day at work, Ray. It's cool. You don't have to answer. Just... [Reggie whooshes away] [man over PA] Hello, students and faculty. Just a friendly reminder, tickets are still available for the marching band practice this weekend. All-you-can-eat pancakes... -Hey. -[gasps] Normal people don't do that. And ghosts definitely shouldn't. What are you doing here? We need to talk about what song we're gonna play tonight. -I was thinking... "Great." -[kids snickering] [girl] Hey, Julie. What's up? [clears throat] Hold up. You're gonna take a call while we're talking? -You know how rude that is? -Hey! Thanks for calling. Otherwise, people might think I'm talking to myself. Right. Nice. No. But, yeah. I think "Great" is a... great choice. Sweet. Well... I mean, that's pretty much what I wanted to talk to you about. So... Oh! OK. Uh, actually, no, there is one more thing I wanted to talk to you about. It's... Look, I know I'm not the easiest person to work with, but I... I wanted to tell you that I think you make me a better writer. I think we make each other better. You know what? Why don't you just ditch school today? Let's go rehearse. What? No. No. I promised dad, school first. Right. You were at school first, and now you're leaving to go rehearse. Come on. I can't do this without you. I can't. I... [sighs] -I told Nick I'd be his dance partner. -[Nick] Hey, Julie! And he's heading this way. Gotta go. Bye. -[Nick] Hey! -Well, don't you look sharp. You ready for our big performance? Oh yeah. Yeah. We're gonna do great. [chuckles] I'm glad you're confident. Even after three classes, I still think I got worse. It's a good thing I got my secret weapon. Uh-oh! I think somebody has a crush on Julie. Shut up. Um... Shut up! [chuckles awkwardly] No, seriously, Molina. I... I... I'm nothing without you. Shh. No. No, you're... You're gonna do fine. See you in there? Yeah. I'll be the guy trying not to make us look stupid. [Nick chuckles] Well, he's just too cute! Boundaries. I'll see you after school. Guess we'll just have to carry you tonight just like we always do! [sighs] [Luke] I know you're smiling. Kill it on the dance floor. [coach] Boys, I want you to focus and leave it all out on the field. [confused muttering] -You're losing them, Frank. -No. I got 'em. Breathe in... [exhales] ...shake out your nerves. Surrender to the music and to your partner. Here we go. [grunts] Oh, ah! Uh... I... I don't remember anything about surrendering. You'll be fine, Luke. It... it's Nick, actually. Right! Nick. Sorry. My brain was wandering. But it wandered back... and now I'm ready to kill it. [rhythmic music plays] [teacher] Five, six, seven, eight.

[jazz riff plays] Look, we add the echoes during the chorus, then when Julie comes in with the melody, it's gonna sound perfect. [distant thud] Again? What's that all about? I don't know. What's your problem? It's like you're tracking me down just so you can keep running away. I wish I could explain, man, but I can't. Wait. That's not good enough. I mean, you've been acting weird ever since Caleb's club. You know, I thought we were having fun together. We never should've met. Wow, that hurts. Hey, I'm sorry, Alex. I really am. You're a great guy. [sighs] I gotta go. [Willie whooshes away] [plays "Perfect Harmony"] There you are. I've been looking all over for you. Why'd you run out of dance class so fast? Sorry. I just needed some air. It was a little intense in there. Oh, I noticed. Dancing with a guy you've had a crush on for forever will do that to a girl. Yeah. But the whole time we were dancing, -I was thinking about Luke. -[Flynn] Seriously? First off, called it. Second, I know you always want what you can't have, but Luke is next-level. I know. And now I think Nick likes me. Nick! He totally does. [sighs] But me and Luke just clicked. And he's so-- Not real. You can make all the music you want with Luke, but... he'll always be a phantom. So... here's what we're gonna do. Send Nick a nice little friendly text asking him to come to your party tonight. Um, I usually don't use that many smiley faces. You do now. I'm not gonna let you get your heart broken. And trust me. Tonight, you're performing with Luke, so the key is avoiding those big, beautiful, dead... eyes. You're very pushy today. You're welcome. [rock music plays] -Alex, you all right? -[Alex] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, why? I know it's tough, man. People say you never forget your first ghost. Maybe that's true. But... I'm sure there will be others. Yeah. Thanks, Reg. -Yeah. -[Alex] Yeah. And, Alex, you're a great drummer and a great guy, OK? I wouldn't let all that stuff get in between you and what you love. I don't know, man. Sometimes a little fire can make things better on stage. Like you and Julie. -Uh, wha... What is that supposed to mean? -[Reggie chuckles] Come on. Everyone can see the way you look at her when you sing. You guys ooze chemistry. You should never say "ooze" again, but, yeah, I agree. OK, no. I have chemistry with everybody that I sing with. Seriously, watch. Uh... ♪ I believe I believe that we're just one dream ♪ ♪ Away from who we're meant to be ♪ ♪ That we're standing on the edge of ♪ ♪ Great ♪ [Alex] Wow. I see chemistry. That was pretty hot. [clears throat] Girls. Am I right? -Yeah. -No. Three, four. [indistinct chattering] [Carrie] Hey. [sighs] What are you doing here? Julie's one of my oldest friends. I'm sure she just forgot to invite me. Look, we're not getting back together, Carrie. [scoffs] I've heard that before. Something doesn't add up about those holograms. I wouldn't trust her... -if I were you. -[applause] [Flynn] What's up, everybody. Time to put your hands up, do a little dance, yup. Here's the new anthem from Julie and the Phantoms.

But epic fail on that eye contact thing. [chuckles] So how do you do those holograms? Oh, don't try to understand it, Carlos. I don't. -That's because you're old. -[fake laughs] Funny guy. I'd send you to your room, but then who's gonna clean up this mess? [giggles] Don't poke the bear. Mm-mm. [tuts] [chuckles] So what are the boys doing right now? Hanging out, I guess. You know, or whatever you do when you're from where they're from. Hey, so, what cameras did you use out there? Interested in my work? Well, uh... I shot with an XF105. That's what I used. The latest model. It's very good. But the other guys had the wide... -[voice fades] -[gentle music plays] Whoo! Feels like we should be celebrating or something. What do you guys wanna do? -[jolt buzzes] -[all groan] [coughs] Not that. That wasn't like the other ones. It's getting worse. Why is this happening to us? It's because you guys are in serious trouble. Willie? We need to talk. All these jolts that we're feeling is because Caleb put his stamp on us? He's threatened by you. He wants you under his control. You're the only ghosts that can be visible to lifers without his help. And you let him do this to us? I can't stop him. He owns my soul. All right? He owns everybody's soul at that club. If he even knew I was here talking to you, he... [sighs] ...he would destroy me. So if we don't join his club, the weird power outage thing continues until there's no power left at all? Yes. What exactly happens when the power goes out? That's... That's it. You're done. Uh-huh. Yeah. And what exactly do you mean by "we're done"? You just... You don't exist... anymore. Not anywhere. -What? -So we have no choice? We have to say goodbye to Julie, give up everything we've built together, and work for Caleb? [sighs] That's some club you guys got going on. But there is another option. That's why I'm here. Another option? Just please hear me out. All right. If you guys could figure out what your unfinished business is, you do it in time, you could cross over and be free from all of this. OK. So what's our unfinished business? I don't know, but since you all died at the same time, it might be something you need to do together. Why should we listen to a word you say? Because I care about you, Alex. And I hate that I brought you... and your friends into this mess. I, uh... I can't be away much longer. I'm so sorry. For everything. This is all my fault. I... I met Willie, Willie introduced us to Caleb, and now... now we're screwed. We all wanted to go see Caleb. We have to tell Julie. No, we can't do that. This just means more loss in her life. But if we don't want Caleb to own our souls, we have to figure out our unfinished business. Yeah, man. And how are we supposed to do that? All right? There was so much we wanted to do. What is it? But the night we died, there was one thing we all wanted to do together. [rock music plays] [Reggie] Play the Orpheum? [Alex] Getting that gig was literally impossible. Even after people knew who we were, we had to hustle, call in every favor we had. It took us years. -[jolt buzzes] -[guys groan, cough] [coughs] [Reggie] Oh! We don't have years.
