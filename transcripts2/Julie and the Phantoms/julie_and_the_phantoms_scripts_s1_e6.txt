 [whimsical music plays] [rock guitar riff plays] [woman] And right. And left. Step, touch. -Step, touch. Step, tou-- -[Julie groans] Oh, Julie, how nice of you to join us. [sighs] I'm so sorry. I overslept. Take your spot. [Julie sighs] So, why didn't you wake me up? I missed my first three classes. -[teacher] Good reach. -You said

 you were never gonna show your face at school again. And I'm a very literal person. -[teacher] Breathe out. -It's OK. It's those stupid ghosts that I'm really upset at. I'd kill them if they weren't already dead. Having a band is supposed to help your social life, not ruin it. Ex-band. Right. Sorry. Ex-band. -[teacher] Get down to the leg. -It's all so messed up. I thought they were in this with me. But obviously, I was wrong. Hey, don't blame yourself. You can only be so strong when three cute ghosts ask you to join a band.

 And speaking of cute, have you talked to Nick today? He was pretty chatty at the dance. No, and I'm kinda dreading it. At least I know I won't see him in this class. Wha... -You've got to be kidding me. -[Flynn] What? [Julie] What are they doing here? [teacher] Right on time, Coach Barron. So, students, Coach Barron and I have decided that his lacrosse team will be part of our class for a few weeks. Many pro athletes have used dance to help them with coordination and mobility. -This isn't about flirting with girls. -[snickering] It's about making us better so we can actually win a game. We lost against Burbank. Burbank! [teacher] Well, let's all remember that composure is a big part of dance. -Everybody pair up. -[boy] Right. Let's go! -No, no! -Come on, Flynn. -I'm sorry. -Don't leave me. Please. Hey. Hey, you. So, ladies, let's do what we learned last week, and we will perform this with the boys this Friday. Coach Barron and I will demonstrate. No. I don't dance. So... -You do now. -[grunts] Oh. And jump out, and bounce, and snake. Reach up... and turn around. -Boys, jump out. -[Nick grunts] [girls giggle] Let's do it again. Half-time, no music. You ready for this? Sure. Uh... My little sister throws a lot of princess dance parties. -[Julie chuckles] -[teacher] Five, six, seven, eight. Nice. Not so bad, Your Majesty. [chuckles] Thank you. [teacher] And torso. So, about last night's dance. Yeah. I was kind of hoping that if I didn't talk about it, it'd be like it never happened. You'll be fine, OK? You're tough. You've been through way worse. -[gasps] -Uh... [teacher] Breathe. Whoa. Um... Sorry. I... [teacher] Really good. Once more. -With music. -[R&B; music plays] I'm just... I'm not used to dancing like this. You and Carrie never dance together? No, and we never will. We broke up. Oh... You did? I'm... [scoffs] ...done with the drama. And I don't know if you noticed, but she's not the nicest person. What? I never noticed. [Nick grunts] Uh... [chuckles] You sure you wanna be partners? No. I... I want you. To be my dance partner! [laughs awkwardly] Let's just... go over it again. We'll get it eventually. Oh, great angle. Yeah. [shutter clicks] Now that's a good pic. Is this what we're here for? To watch people take pictures of food? It's fun. Watch this. People never stop looking at their phones. Oop! Ehh! Whoop. [Reggie chuckles] Luke said something about this place being a hot spot for music industry people. Yes! Boys, being a ghost definitely has its privileges. I just wrote our names on the playlist for tonight. I'm getting a little worried about him. He keeps forgetting Julie quit the band. She's gonna come back as soon as she knows we have a great gig. But if she doesn't come back, let's not forget, we do have somewhere else we can play and eat pizza. Dude, I know. It was awesome to be seen by lifers at Caleb's party, but... but we got this with Julie. We don't need him. -[jolt buzzes] -[boys groan] Oh! It's the same thing again! Just like yesterday! It feels like that time I was fixing my amp in the rain. You shouldn't... OK. Look, do you think something's wrong with us? Yeah. Yeah, we ate ten pounds of pizza yesterday without a stomach. I'm sure it's just our bodies working through it. So we're just gonna forget about getting back at Trevor? That jerk stole our music. And he has to live with that guilt. It's just like what Julie said. We have a new band, a new sound, OK? That's what we should be focusing on. Isn't that Willie? [mysterious music plays] [chuckles] Well, someone's not focusing on our music. [chuckles lightly] [siren approaches] [mysterious music continues] [ominous music plays] Hello, William. Caleb, hi. Um... I... I was actually just-- Checking on the boys for me? How is my band doing? Uh... Well, they're flickering. Just like you wanted them to. Wonderful. Oh, and William, the next time you want to check on the boys for me, let me know. Yeah, my bad. You do love skating the streets of Hollywood. Would hate to have to take that away from you. [sighs] ♪ We're sorry ♪ ♪ So sorry ♪ ♪ We're super-duper, crazy, stupid ♪ ♪ Sorry ♪ In case you missed it, we're really sorry. Yeah. I... I got that part. We've been here for, like, three hours. Yup. We almost sang to your little brother. He comes in here a lot. Mainly to use the bathroom. Yeah. It's not our favorite part of the day. But, Julie, it wasn't OK that we flaked on the dance last night. We know we let you down. Yeah, and none of us wanted to disappoint you. You're the best thing that's happened to us since we became ghosts. So, in hopes that you'll rejoin the band, we booked a new gig. A mega important, life-changing gig. Oh, OK. Check it out. Tons of managers go here to listen to new bands. All we gotta do is blow them all away, and we're living the dream. So this means a lot to you, huh? Kind of how playing in front of my whole entire school meant a lot to me. Sounds like sarcasm. [gasps] I'm starting to think our plan isn't working. Look, we know we messed up. But we need you in the band. Of course you do, because without me, no one can see you guys playing. You know, I thought that the music that we were writing was special, but you're too obsessed with your past to even care. I do care. Our band has a real chance at greatness. I'm not gonna let that get away from us again. Uh-huh. Right. So then why did you bail on me to get back at Trevor? I'll tell you why. 'Cause there's only one thing you care about, and that's yourself. [sad music plays] Dude, she didn't mean it. Where's he going? Where do you think? Remember what today is? [Alex sighs] [both grunt] [Julie sighs] Hey, you, uh... you got a second? [Julie sighs] Oh my gosh. She can't see us anymore! Oh. Right. Yep. Julie, please. I already told you that I'm done with the band. Yeah, we know, all right? But before you decide that forever, we just... We wanted you to know that Luke isn't as selfish as you think. Yeah, you've got him all wrong. [scoffs] You remember that song "Emily"? Can we at least show you who that's actually about? [sentimental music plays] So, Emily's his mom? Yeah. Yeah, Luke comes here a lot. He thinks we don't know, but... we've been following him. All he does is just hang out like this and watch them. They never really do anything though. [sentimental music continues] They're having cake. That's something. It's a... It's a birthday cake. For Luke. I never knew Luke was hurting this much. Yeah. It's even worse because when he died, he... left on bad terms. You know, his parents didn't want their 17-year-old in a rock band, so... he just left. He never got the chance to make up with them. [Reggie] That's why Luke was so angry. If Trevor had given Luke credit for writing all the songs, then... [Reggie sighs] ...his parents would've known his dream was worth chasing. They would have been so proud. [sentimental music intensifies] [Emily sighs] [sniffles] [Emily sighs] [sniffles] We know how bad it hurts whenever someone that should've had your back... completely lets you down. We never meant to make you feel that way. Julie, we love our band, and Luke does too. Please give us another chance. [upbeat soft rock music plays] ♪ Marching on proud ♪ ♪ Turn it up loud ♪ ♪ 'Cause now we know what we're worth ♪ Whoa, Julie. Grab your guitar. We got work to do. [chuckles] What made you come back? I realized how important music is to all of us. And we've lost so much already. We can't lose this too. Thanks. All right, boss. Where we at? [chuckles] [chuckles] Oh, and by the way, happy birthday. [chuckles] Let's go from the pre-chorus. One, two, three, four. ♪ Been so long, and now I'm finally free ♪ -♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ -[camera clicks] Oh... What are you doing? Looking for those orb things. I'm telling you, this place is haunted. Every time I open my laptop, it's on some... rock music site. That ain't me. You know I'm all about the rap. [chuckles] Reggie. I'm just trying to protect you. Oh, I'd be careful in there. Dad has that look on his face like when Google Maps tells him to turn on the wrong street. [suspenseful music plays] Care to tell me why you missed the first three classes today? I overslept at Flynn's house after the dance. There was nothing going on in those classes anyways. [camera clicks] It won't happen again. I promise. OK. But if I know you missed class, it's only a matter of time before... [aunt sighs] I came as fast as I could. Exactly. Julie, I will not let you fall into the gutter of life. Tía, I'm fine. I just overslept. And me and Dad already talked about it. [aunt scoffs] You are far from fine, sobrina. I called your teacher. She said you missed a calculus test. Nothing going on, huh? Dad, I'm so sorry. [sighs] This is where you punish her. I know. Julie... no more going out on school nights. -But, Dad, tonight... -[aunt clears throat] And go to your room. -[clears throat] -What else? What? And... And read. Study. Calculus. Go! Now! You know I'm only here to help, right? I know. And sometimes I look a little annoyed... but I do appreciate you. You need me to look after Carlos, don't you? Just a couple of hours. [mysterious music plays] Mijo! [cell phone beeps] [scoffs] [chuckles] Nick! What are you guys doing? We're being classy. Whoa! Why are you still here? We're going in, like, 20 minutes. I lied to my dad, so... now I'm stuck in my room all night. Yeah, but we were just at the venue. I mean, it's packed. Like, VIPs, managers. It's kind of crazy. What are we gonna do about my aunt? She's right downstairs. [Luke] Your aunt. You're not taking the stairs. OK. Let me get dressed. I'll meet you guys there. [snaps fingers] [sentimental music plays] [sighs] [chuckles] -[announcer] Next up, Dirty Candy. -Am I too late? Too early. [cheering] Hope you all came to have a great time. [giggles] [cheering, whooping] Dirty Candy? How'd she get on the list? Her daddy probably made a call. [sighs] I like this! Pretty flower. Thanks. It's a dahlia.

I forgot why I hate her so much. Hi, girls. Um, isn't it past your bedtime? Now I remember. Hmm. If you're looking for Nick, he didn't come. [scoffs] That's not why I'm here. OK, it looks like we're closing the night out with one more group, "Julie and The Fat Ones." [snickering] Really? Yeah, man. My handwriting sucks. [chuckles awkwardly] [huffs] Hi.
