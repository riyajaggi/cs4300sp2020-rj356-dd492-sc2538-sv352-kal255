 [whimsical music plays] [rock guitar riff plays] [rhythmic jazz music plays] [horn honks] [Luke] This is awesome, you guys. We're playing the Orpheum! I can't even count how many bands have played here and then ended up being huge. [chuckles] We're gonna be legends. Eat up, boys, 'cause after tonight, everything changes.

 [nostalgic music plays] [sighs] Is this seat taken? [sighs heavily] This whole thing sucks. Yeah, I messed up. No, it's like you said... you know, you didn't have a choice. I mean, Caleb owns your soul. No. [inhales sharply] No, still, I know what he's capable of. I brought you guys right to him. When you guys asked me, I should've just skated away. I would have still followed you. [chuckles lightly]

 Man... I would do anything to take back what I did to you. -[jolt buzzes] -[groans] [sighs] I am so sorry. I mean, did you guys figure out what your unfinished business is? [scoffs] Not like it's gonna happen. We have to play here. [wistful music plays] The... the Orpheum? Yeah, I mean, we were two hours away from getting on that stage the night we died. You guys were gonna be legends. We were. I don't know why you guys want these, but OK. [laughs] [girl] Thank you, Julie. -Let me see! [gasps] -[boy] Yeah! Can I get a selfie too? I have to check with security. [chuckles] Oh wait. I don't have any. Yeah, you laugh, but after last night's performance, it's pretty clear: -you guys are gonna blow up. -Pfft! It was just a garage party. -Don't go all crazy on me. -Um, sorry I couldn't stay for the whole thing. -I had a ton of homework. -It's fine. Thanks for coming. Thanks for inviting me. See you around. So, um, listen. Since we make such a great team, you know, with dance and everything... and, uh, you have an A in history, any chance we could be study partners? [chuckles awkwardly] I'd love to, but with the band, I'm not sure I'll have any free time. Sorry. Oh, nah, no worries. Um... Then, I'll ask you this: any chance you could find time to go on a date with me? Wow, Nick wants to go on a date with me. You'd know that, 'cause you're him. I am. [chuckles] I'm flattered. Really. You're great. Really great. [chuckles] That doesn't sound like a yes. [sighs] [sighs] You... You like someone else, don't you? Yeah, kinda. Guess I, uh... [chuckles] ...missed my chance. Um... OK, then. Still dance partners, right? Yeah. Of course. OK. And awkward exit. Um... See ya. [chuckles] See ya. Well, that wasn't just a "What's up?" Nick wanted to go on a date. [gasps] And I said no. What? You know what you said. This Luke thing isn't going away any time soon, so I... I figured why waste Nick's time? Aww! My baby's all grown up. [chuckles] She's choosing to like someone who doesn't really exist, but she's all grown up. But he does exist. To me. And he might just be air, but we connect in so many other ways. You are the most watchable duet-ers I've ever seen. But it's not just singing. When we write, we're drawing from the same pain. We both know how it feels to lose our moms. Do not make me cry. I'm having a really good eyeliner day. It's just... Luke's hurting so much, I wish I could help him. Maybe you could write him a song! That would make him feel better! Oh my gosh, Flynn, you're a genius! -Julie, you still have class. -Right. Like I said... genius. [chuckles] [Reggie] Hmm... Wow! Ooh, I like this one. It's got a good composition, buddy. [sighs loudly] What are you doin'? Eh, I needed a pick-me-up, and hanging with Ray always does the trick. Does it? OK. -Dad, I have a ghost update. -OK, this might be interesting. Really? Come on, Carlos, we've talked about this. I know you're not a believer, but listen to this. -Do I have a choice? -No. You go, little man. After Julie played with her hologram band last night, I couldn't sleep. Those songs do get stuck in your head. -He likes our new music too. -Ah, still doesn't count. I learned on YouTube that ghosts haunt because something's bothering them. So to get rid of them, you gotta find out what crawled up their ghost butts! -[giggling] He said "ghost butts." -Language. -Sorry. -Sorry. So, I searched the house for clues on who used to live here. And I found a bunch of old stuff in the garage. What I learned is we're being haunted by a ghost... who had a dream. OK. -A dream that never came true. -[suspenseful music plays] A dream that was cut short... by a tragic accident. OK, you... you don't actually think-- Our house... is being haunted... by a very talented... chef. [both sigh with relief] Looks like somebody fell asleep watching Ghost Hunters and Chopped. You know how there are two restaurants in LA that claim they've invented the French dip? Guess what I found in this shoebox? A recipe... for a third French dip! -No way! -No way! It was invented in 1905... by a guy who... dreamed of a soggy sandwich. But died before he could share his gift. [both] Ah... the gift of dipping. It's like we're the same person. [snickers] Just like! So we gotta make his sandwich, and we gotta eat it. [Ray] Oh, then, he'll see his dream realized and finally leave this world for good. So are you in? Yeah, let's make a dream come true. All right. I do love French dips. I'm gonna miss them. Me too. [sentimental music plays] [inhales deeply, exhales slowly] Luke! What are you doing here? OK, look. I... I just wanted to know more about you, you know, just curious. Um... So, I came here last week on your birthday. You were spying on me? Even after all your speeches about boundaries? -You were spying on me? -I know. I'm sorry. It was wrong. But I'm worried about you. You don't have to be. I get it. I know how hard it is when you want to speak to someone you love and can't. I feel that way every day. I don't even know what I'd say to her, even if she could hear me. Yes, you do. You've already said it. Trust me. [sentimental music plays] [doorbell rings] Hello. Can I help you? Hi. I'm Julie. Um... I believe you had a son named Luke? Yes, that's right. And you are again? Julie Molina. Um... your son's band used to play in my family's garage? I... I came across this song that he wrote and figured you might be interested? Um... Well, yes. Uh, please... please come in. I'm... I'm Mitch. Nice to meet you. Can I, um, get you something? Oh, no. I'm good. Thank you. Is this your son? Yeah, that's Luke. When he was two. Do you have any other children? No. Did I hear the doorbell? Hi, hon. Um, this is Julie. [Emily] Hello, Julie. Oh, that's a beautiful sweater. Thanks. It's my mom's. Julie lives in the house where Luke and the band rehearsed. She was just telling me she found a song that Luke wrote. It's a song about a girl named Emily? -[whispers] Emily... -Oh... I'm Emily. Then I think your son may have written this song for you. -["Unsaid Emily" plays] -[Emily sniffles] Oh... ♪ First things first ♪ ♪ We start the scene in reverse ♪ ♪ All of the lines rehearsed ♪ ♪ Disappeared from my mind ♪ ♪ When things got loud ♪ ♪ One of us running out ♪ -♪ I should have turned around ♪ -[sobs loudly] ♪ But I had too much pride ♪ ♪ No time for goodbyes ♪ ♪ Didn't get to apologize ♪ ♪ Pieces of a clock that lies broken ♪ ♪ If I could take us back ♪ ♪ If I could just do that ♪ ♪ And write in every empty space ♪ ♪ The words "I love you" in replace ♪ ♪ Then maybe time would not erase me ♪ ♪ If you could only know ♪ ♪ I never let you go ♪ ♪ And the words I most regret ♪ ♪ Are the ones I never meant to leave ♪ ♪ Unsaid Emily ♪ ♪ Silent days ♪ ♪ Mysteries and mistakes ♪ ♪ Who'd be the first to break? ♪ ♪ Guess we're alike that way ♪ ♪ He said, she said ♪ ♪ Conversations in my head ♪ ♪ And that's just where They're gonna stay forever ♪ ♪ If I could take us back ♪ ♪ If I could just do that ♪ ♪ And write in every empty space ♪ ♪ The words "I love you" in replace ♪ ♪ Then maybe time would not erase me ♪ ♪ If you could only know ♪ ♪ I never let you go ♪ ♪ And the words I most regret ♪ ♪ Are the ones I never meant to leave ♪ ♪ Unsaid Emily ♪ [all] ♪ Ah-ah-ah ♪ ♪ Ah-ah-ah ♪ [Luke] ♪ If I could take us back ♪ ♪ If I could just do that ♪ ♪ And write in every empty space ♪ ♪ The words "I love you" in replace ♪ ♪ Then maybe time would not erase me ♪ ♪ If you could only know ♪ -♪ I never let you go ♪ -[sobbing] ♪ And the words I most regret ♪ ♪ Are the ones I never meant to leave ♪ ♪ Unsaid Emily ♪ [sniffles] Thank you. -[Emily sobs] -[Mitch] Um... You... you have no idea... -[sniffles] -[Emily inhales, exhales deeply] I write music in the same room that he did, and I can tell you it is a magical, happy place. [chuckles] -[sniffles] -That's so nice to know. I know he was only 17 -when he... -[sniffles] ["Unsaid Emily" instrumental plays gently] But he lived doing the one thing he was born to do. Not many people find that, but Luke did. He was lucky. [sniffles, breathes shakily] It was so nice to meet you. It was nice to meet you too. ["Unsaid Emily" instrumental continues] Hey. Hey. I'm sorry for overstepping. No, I... I just had to leave. -That was... -You don't have to say anything. [Luke] Yeah, I do. Uh... I didn't have many regrets in my life except for running out on my parents. Especially my mom, so... thank you. You helped me feel more connected to my mom, so... I wanted to do the same thing for you. That was perfect. [whooshing] [sighs] This is an interesting little relationship you and I have. [chuckles lightly] Oh my gosh, I almost forgot to tell you. Flynn said the video that my dad made is trending on YouTube. That's a good thing. That means people love our music. We'll definitely be getting calls from managers now. There's something I have to tell you. Oh... OK. We figured out that we have unfinished business. That's why we came back as ghosts. Oh. What is it? We have to play the show we never got to play. At the Orpheum? That makes sense. -[jolt buzzes] -[groans] [Luke winces] -We don't have a lot of time. -What was that? Are you OK? We did something that we shouldn't have. The night that we missed the dance, we met this ghost, and he put this curse on us. And if we don't do what he says, then those jolts will destroy us. Then you gotta do what he says. What does he want? He wants us to be in his house band for eternity. But if we can play the Orpheum soon, then we can avoid all that and actually cross over. "Cross over"? As in, like what? Like go to heaven? That's what we're banking on. So it's either you cross over, be in his band for eternity, or be destroyed by those jolts? Yeah. That's just great. -[door opens] -Julie... [door slams] [footsteps approach] [knocking on door] Hey. I got your text. Don't come too close. Anyone I seem to care about disappears. [Flynn] You can't get rid of me. I'm like the crazy glue of best friends. I just don't get it. Right when my life starts to get good. Great friend, great band, great guy... then bam! [Flynn] I seriously don't know why all of this is happening to you, but that's gonna be a great album cover one day. You don't have to do that. I know, but I get to check out all your mom's cool stuff. [Flynn] Whoa... Did you know this was in here? [scoffs] What the heck? How do you think she got it? I... I don't know, but the guys said they didn't know my mom. Why would they lie? Maybe they didn't. Maybe she knew them. She could be a fan! I mean, Sunset Curve was playing the Hollywood club scene around then. Oh my gosh. What if you were right? What if the guys are connected to your mom? You know, through music or something. Because she bought their T-shirt? Think about it. They were the ones who made you wanna play music again. Maybe she knew they could help you. So, you mean to tell me that my mom is somewhere out there planning all this? If she wanted me to play music again, why wouldn't she just tell me herself? Maybe she can't. Maybe she has to do it another way. You know, through signs. You've been through these clothes how many times and haven't found this T-shirt? Why now? This is another sign. I'm just saying. It's not over, Julie! Really? "Signs"? You're in a ghost band. It's a crazy world. Look... you're gonna lose them no matter what. And it sucks. But they helped bring you back to life. Now it's your turn to help them. They have to cross over. Let them go. [discordant note twangs] [clicks tongue] -[discordant note continues twanging] -Ah! [sighs] -Snap out of it! -[gasps] [drumsticks clatter] Jeez, I think you broke Alex. Do you guys want to cross over or what? Get it together! They're never gonna let us play the Orpheum. -We're nobody. -We're less than nobody. -We have no bodies. -[snaps fingers] Someone once told me that you don't ask for permission. -[chuckles lightly] -You book gigs by doing. That was me. -No, it wasn't. -No, it wasn't. -Yes, it was. -[Julie] This isn't over. We were brought together for a reason: to help each other. Yeah, but like Luke said, people don't just play the Orpheum because they want to. People don't, but ghosts do. -[rock guitar riff plays] -[hi-hat chicks rhythmically] [Alex] One, two, three.
