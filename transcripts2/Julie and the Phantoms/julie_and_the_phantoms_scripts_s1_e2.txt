 [whimsical music plays] [rock guitar riff plays] Oh, dude, why'd you stop me? Julie needs a hug. Bro, a ghost hug isn't the feel-good moment that you think it is. All right? Trust me. What Julie needs right now is just a bit of privacy. You know what? I think you poofed us out because you can't handle when people cry. I should know. I cried in a room for 25 years, and I didn't get a single hug from either of you.

 -All right. Bring it in. -Don't touch me! This is why no one hugs you. OK. I think the first thing we should do, once we get the courage to go in there, is ask Julie... why she lied about playing the piano. Yeah, you know, maybe tell her how amazing she is. -Yeah, course, bro. -OK. She's legit. I got ghost bumps. [Flynn sobs quietly] Oh my gosh. Was she crying too? Yes! And the only thing scarier than one girl crying is two girls crying. -He's right. -Guys, we definitely can't go in there.

 But we can listen. [mischievous music plays] Carlos told me you'd be out here. We need to talk. Are you OK? No, I'm not OK! You just got kicked out of music! I've been up all night thinking about what I was gonna say. Might've drank seven sodas, but... I need to get this out. -Wait. I have something to tell you-- -No, it's my turn to talk. You can't give up music. Your music's like a gift, that would be a tragedy. So, you're basically, like, canceling Christmas, and I love Christmas! -Flynn, I-- -Uh-uh! When we were six, we promised to be in a band together. Double Trouble. I never agreed to that name. [sighs] That's not the point. Jules, if you leave the music program, we'll be apart forever. That's just what happens. Sure we'll see each other in the hall sometime, but... we'll have different lives, make new friends. That's not true. You're right. I won't be making any new friends. The only time we'll contact each other is when we'll be liking each other's posts on Instagram. Every time I'll be hitting that little heart, my heart will be breaking because my best friend left me, and... Do you have any soda? My head hurts. Can I talk now? Fine. I just played the piano and sang again. What? Why didn't you just say so? I was trying, then your seven sodas kicked in. I'm so happy for you! And me! [giggles] Look at you, looking all, I don't know, alive again. Right? It's like I drank seven sodas. What made you play again? [sentimental music plays] I found this song my mom wrote me. Whoa. I know. I was so afraid to play it. Anything involving music reminds me of her. And then I woke up this morning... realizing that's why I should play it. To keep her memory alive. [chuckles lightly] Aw! Come here. [gasps] We need to tell Mrs. Harrison you can play so you can stay in school and my life won't be that sad picture I just painted for you. My girl's back. Double Trouble lives again! Not our band name. I gave you a T-shirt in the 7th grade that says otherwise. Oops! [mystical music plays] Oh hey! Let's hustle! Don't worry! We weren't listening. Oh. Uh... Oh. [giggles awkwardly] [Julie] Let's go! I wonder why Julie didn't tell us she could shred on the piano? And sing. That girl can sing. It probably has something to do with her mom. You know? Must've been hard. Anyway, I really feel for her. Yeah, but... now she's got music back in her life, just like us. Yeah, I'm not sure you can call what we have a life. Oh hey, some of the clothes we left behind are still up here. [Alex chuckles] Sweet. -[Reggie giggles] -Oh, same clothes since '95, boys. [mystical music plays] [Reggie exhales, groans] Oh, that was weird! But somehow I can tell this man has a kind heart. So, how've ya been? Honestly, not that good. See, we ate these hot dogs, and-- Julie sang for the first time this morning. Ah! She hadn't done that in almost a year. You would've loved it. Yeah, we saw 'cause we were... -Oh! -[shutter clicks] Oh, I get it. He... He's not talking to us. You are so lucky you can play bass. Pretty sure he's talking to Julie's mom. She's such an amazing young woman. Every day she reminds me more and more of you. Called it. Oh, I'm, uh... I'm taking pictures for the real estate website. I don't really wanna move, but... I guess it's best for Julie. Move? There's so many memories of Julie playing next to you, and... [chuckles] ...Carlos trying to sing with his missing two front teeth. [Luke breathes shakily] Oh no, Luke, not you too. [Luke holds back sobs] He... He's talking about moving, but the poor guy, he doesn't wanna move. -[Luke sniffles] -[shutter clicks] It's like they grew up... out here. Oh man, now's he's got me too. OK, how am I the emotional one? C-C-Can we go see my family and see how they're doing? Yeah. Yeah, listening to this feels... wrong. Hey, do you remember when the kids were at your sister's, and we came out here on our anniversary... Yeah. No, definitely wrong. Ooh! Yep. [Mrs. Harrison] Believe me, I think it's wonderful that you sang again. I prayed for this moment for almost a year. But it's too late. What if you just hear her play? You know she's amazing. It wouldn't matter. A new student starts tomorrow. -[sighs] There's only-- -So many spots, and if I don't participate, I'm out. I know. I did everything I could to keep you here this year, but Principal Lessa was very clear that yesterday was your last chance. You'll have to reapply next semester. -[sad music plays] -[bell rings] [sighs] I'm truly sorry. [door opens] [Mrs. Harrison] Hand these out, please. [boy] Go, go, go! To me! -[girl 1] Come on! -[girl 2] Pass it up! A bike shack right where my house used to be. Right here. Yeah, I'm sorry, man. [Reggie] They made the Meyersons' house into a noodle shop. Why couldn't they have made mine a pizzeria or something? They tore down the whole neighborhood. I guess my folks are gone. No. Everyone's gone. Twenty-five years, gone. Friends, family, Bobby, everyone. Bobby, that's right. I guess that vegetarian lucked out. What do you think happened to him? He probably just got old like everybody else and moved on. Dude, how are you so casual about all of this? -Don't you wanna figure out what happened? -Let's be real for a second. It's not like we were that close to our families. My folks always regretted buying me that guitar. Reggie, your parents were literally a fight away from a divorce. Alex, I... Your parents were never cool again after you told them you were gay. OK. None of us had it great. All right? But at least we had something. You know, what do we have now? And before you say cool teleportation skills, just know I'm not entirely OK with that either. All right? It tingles. In weird places. I'll tell you what we had. It's what we've had since the day we came together. Boys, we have us. We're the only family we're ever gonna need. -You know what else we have? -I'm gonna guess death breath. Our music, you dork. [chuckles] We have our music, you guys. People, actual people, can hear us play! They can't see us, fine, but they can feel us. If I had my guitar, I'd play for all these people right now. Just like what we used to do down at the pier. They can't tip what they can't see. It's not about the tips, Alex. It's about playing music. Connecting with people. Making a difference in their day. I just... I wish I had my guitar. [discordant note plays] Whoa! -That was rad. How'd you do that? -I don't know. I-I-I mean, I wished for it, and then it came in my hands... I-I-I wish I had a puppy. -A hamster? -OK. [sighs] Pizza? [groans] Hey, I think I know something that'll cheer you up. [plays upbeat tune] Come on, Reginald! A one, two, three, four. ♪ Can you? ♪ ♪ Can you hear me? ♪ Yep, loud and clear! ♪ We gotta get ♪ ♪ Gotta get ready ♪ 'Cause it's been years! ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ This band is back ♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ This band is back ♪ -[kids cheer, giggle] -[band] ♪ Woohoo, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Woohoo, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Woohoo, ooh, ooh ♪ -♪ Can you ♪ -♪ Yes, we can ♪ ♪ Can you hear me? ♪ ♪ Loud and clear ♪ ♪ We gotta get, wanna get We gotta get ready ♪ -Huh? -♪ 'Cause it's been years ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ This band is back ♪ -[band] ♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh ♪ -[boy] Yeah! ♪ This band is back... ♪ You won't find the speaker. It's direct spot audio. I heard about it in a TED talk. [girl] Cool. -[girl giggles, whoops] -♪ Woohoo, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Whoo-ooh... ♪ [Alex] Yee-ha! [band scat sings] [band continues scat singing] [whooshing] What are you doing in my room? -Uh... -[high-pitched] Um... We were looking for the kitchen? This... This can't happen. It's creepy. Get off my bed, please. Hey, Julie. -What's in the box? -That's off-limits. [chuckling] Oh. Oh, OK. Girl stuff. -Oh, like butterflies and glitter? -Oh, come on. I'm sorry about them. It's none of your business. And yes, there might be some glitter. Hey! [chuckles] I actually picked something up. I dropped it. -Is that your mom? -Yes, and it's my favorite picture of us. You break it, I'll break you. OK, well, sorry because we're kind of unbreakable at this point. I don't get it. You guys can mess up my bed, pick up your instruments, but you can't pick up other stuff? I know, right? It's hard. But for some reason, our instruments, easy. Yeah, like super easy. Oh, and check out what I learned today. [grunts, groans] Ah! Yeah, that looked super easy. [groans] It's like I always thought, our instruments are attached to our souls. -[footsteps approaching] -[dad] Hey. Everything OK? Yeah. -I'm fine. -[dad] OK. -I thought I heard you talking to someone. -Nope. Must've been my laptop... that I just closed. [chuckles lightly] OK. If you need anything... Yeah. Thanks. [Alex exhales sharply] Your dad seems like the kind of guy who likes to barbecue. I bet he has a great ribs recipe. I don't know. But if you guys wanna talk to me, we have to do it in the studio. He's worried about me enough as it is. He seems chill. You should just tell him about us. You're kidding, right? [sighs] This past year, everyone's been watching over me, being super nice, as if they're waiting for me to snap. If I tell my dad I met a ghost band, I'll be back to talking to Dr. Turner three days a week. [clicks tongue] You probably shouldn't tell him. -Julie... -Oh my gosh! I told you to leave that alone! I know. You just shouldn't have said nothing 'cause now I can't stop thinking about it, so... What's in the box, Julie? It's just my dream box, OK? Whenever I get a thought, I write it down and get it out of my mind. Like lyrics? They would be if I still wrote music like I used to with my mom. Now it's just full of stuff that doesn't make me sad. But, I mean, you do play. We heard you this morning. In the garage? So you were there too? -Uh... I don't... -Uh... He was, like... -We were... -Somewhere. So, where is your kitchen, by the way? OK, we need to set some boundaries. For starters, stay out of my room! -Mm-hmm. Crystal clear. Let's go. -We're leaving. [Reggie] Yes, ma'am! We are out of here. [Reggie strums guitar strings] Hey! Um, sorry. I didn't mean to bother you. Did you get back into your music program? No. No, I didn't. I'm sorry. That really sucks. Thanks. [sighs] Is that it? Yeah. Yeah. This is getting weird. OK. [game music plays, beeping] [Julie] Hey, Dad. What'cha working on? Well, now that the house is on the market, we need to add some photos to the website. Help me pick some good ones. -Got this batch right here. -[Julie] These are really nice. -Yeah? -Yeah. Thanks. These didn't turn out, though. The ones from mom's studio. It's like... little lights and dots all over the place. Kinda look like orbs, right? Orbs? I've seen some freaky stuff about those on YouTube. People say they're ghosts. Do you think that's Mom and she made some friends? [chuckles] That's a nice thought, but there are no such things as ghosts. Sounds like someone's spending too much time on the internet. -You can just trash those. -All right. So trash, trash, trash. Um, Dad? Yeah? I was thinking, if we're just moving 'cause of me, and you and Carlos wanna stay, -I'm fine with that. -I vote we stay! I don't wanna have to clean under my bed. Noted. What made you have second thoughts? I don't know. I guess a combination of things. [chuckles lightly] I know that tía says that moving is moving on, but I don't think that's the answer. I totally agree with you on that. I mean, I think... I think moving on has to come from the inside. And one of us took a huge step this morning. All our memories of Mom are here, and we should be too. Can we stay? All votes are in. Yes! Yes. Yes! Thank you. [chuckles] -I love you, Dad. -Get in here. Come on. -Mm! Big tight group hug. -[Julie chuckles] [sighs] OK. Somebody help me find my phone. I need to call the real estate agent. Oh, um, I think I saw it in the kitchen. Kitchen. [Julie sighs] [mischievous music plays] [guitar riff plays] Ghosts. [sighs heavily] [sniffs] Ah! I'm never gonna get used to that. [Julie sighs] Do you guys even eat? I just wanna see what'cha got. Hey! You know how long it took me to open that? Sorry, I don't believe in wasting power. Good. Because that's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about. Our power usage? No. The power that you have. Your voice. Your piano playing. Dude, you're like a human wrecking ball. [chuckles lightly] Is this a pep talk? What I'm saying is that you have the power to move people. To knock them off their feet. There is no way your teachers wouldn't let you back into school if they heard you play like that. I asked her. She said I have to wait until next semester. That was your first mistake. Asking. Sunset Curve booked gigs by doing. We went into ambush mode. We played in front of clubs. We played in back of clubs. We even played book clubs. Book clubs? Yeah. We didn't get many gigs out of that one, but they did have some gnarly snacks. I'm just saying, don't ask for permission. Swing that wrecking ball of talent at your teacher's head, and smash those stupid rules right outta their brains. This isn't a club, it's a school, and your plan sounds violent. It's a closed door, and you gotta bust it open. [Julie scoffs] Sorry. Once I start with the metaphors, I can't stop. I learned that in book club. They're not just gonna let me back in. [Luke chuckles lightly] If getting back into music is what you want, then you gotta go for it. Learn from me. Your tainted hot dog could be right around the corner. [sighs] -I don't even have anything prepared. -Thought you'd say that. It's called "Bright." It's a Sunset Curve song I wrote that we never got to record. But it's perfect for your range. Check out the chorus for a second.

[chuckles] Thanks. [chuckles lightly] [plays discordant trumpet notes] [plays discordant trumpet notes] What are you doing, and where is everyone? [sighs] Spirit assembly. I was kind of blowing it off 'cause I wasn't feeling very spirity. [sighs] You OK? Not really. I had this new plan to play for Mrs. Harrison, hoping that she'd let me back in, but... I guess I missed my chance. No... you didn't.
