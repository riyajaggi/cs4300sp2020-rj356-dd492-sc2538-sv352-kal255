 [whimsical music plays] [rock guitar riff plays] [rock music plays] [Alex] Look, don't worry, guys. Willie said he'd get us on that marquee. This is gonna work, right? It has to. -[jolt buzzes] -[all groan] Hey, are you guys OK? [gasps] Yeah. Yeah, it's nothing we haven't felt before.

 How'd it go? Well, when that opening band wakes up, they're gonna find their bus 200 miles outside of Vegas -with no chance of getting back in time. -[giggling] And that means there's probably a promoter upstairs right about now freakin' out. Nah. This is Hollywood, man. I'm sure he's being very professional. What do you mean the bus drove itself into the middle of the desert? Buses don't drive themselves! [snickering] I know... how much you're risking. Thank you, Willie. I told you,

 I'd do anything for you. -[breathes heavily] -[sentimental music plays] [clears throat] All right. You, uh... You'd better get out of here before Caleb catches you with us. Yeah. I'll see you around, hot dog. [chuckles] Alex, you all right, man? Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK. Well, thanks to Willie, Panic! At The Disco needs an opening band. Then I guess someone up there needs to know we're available. [chuckling] -No... No, stop. Stop! -[muttering over phone] -[man] ...by itself. -Stop! stop saying the bus drove itself. -[thuds continue] -[woman groans] OK. Yeah, Willie was right. This guy's a total pro. [snickers] All right, boys. Let the magic happen. Alex, no dancing. [classical dance music plays] [woman] What? -[woman] Ugh! -[Reggie mutters] -OK. There we go. -That's what I'm saying. -[woman groans] -She's coming. ♪ I believe that we're just one dream ♪ ♪ Away from who we're meant to be ♪ ♪ That we're standing on the edge... ♪ [man] Tasha! Get me CJ. Tell him I need a band to open in three hours. -Sure, but you might wanna check this out. -[Alex chuckles] What? I'll call you back. ♪ ...on the edge of great... ♪ Somehow this video started playing on my laptop. It's got half a million hits in just two days. -♪ Great ♪ -♪ On the edge of great... ♪ -Who are they? -They're a hologram band. They call themselves Julie and the Phantoms. Tell your friends. Where are they located? Our very own City of Angels. -Book 'em! -Yes! -Sure, I just don't know how to... -[eerie music plays] [man] OK, I got it. Your handwriting is better than mine. -[man] ...kind of hologram band. -Definitely. Yeah. [sighs] Oh my gosh! What took you guys so long? Did Willie do it? Did you talk to them? Did they watch? Did they like us? Are we playing? Someone answer! Why's no one talking? Whoa! That's a lot of questions! -Luke, you wanna take this one? -Take a seat. It's fine. Everything's fine. Yeah. You should be getting a call right... now! OK. Right... now! -[ringtone plays] -[Julie screams] Nailed it. -Go! -Oh! Um... [clears throat] Hello? Hi, this is Tasha from the Orpheum in Hollywood. -[rock music plays] -Is this Julie of Julie and the Phantoms? [groans, clears throat] Yes, it is. -[Tasha] Hi. -[all grunt] Are you available to open for us tonight? [Julie] Yeah, totally. -OK. -Thank you so much. -See you then. -[Julie] We're doing it! [all giggle, cheer] We're playing the Orpheum, baby! Yeah! [Alex] Yeah! I'm swimming. I'm telling you, tía, it was a win-win. The ghost is gone, and me and Dad got a killer French dip sandwich. But how do you know the ghost is really gone? I don't wanna get emotional, but I felt something when I took that last bite. Like his tortured spirit was set free. Sure it wasn't one of your little tummy toots? I don't tummy toot! I'm a ghost hunter now. I'm starting a channel, "Carlos the Ghost Toaster." I like it. Mijo, the ghost. Did you check the closet upstairs? Hold on a second, tía. [rock riff plays] [Carlos] I knew it. Ghosts. -Tía, I gotta go. -[aunt] Carlos... -[door closes] -[sighs] [Julie, over speakers] ♪ ...tripping on the now ♪ -[groans] -♪ What is lost can be found... ♪ -Hey, baby. -Hey. -[exhales sharply] -♪ And like a rubber ball... ♪ What is that? -♪ We come bouncing back... ♪ -Sounds good. Please don't say that. -♪ ...in front of us... ♪ -[Trevor chuckles] Is that... Is that Julie? Yeah. She has a band with those guys. Of course she needed a gimmick. They're holograms. And somehow, because the world hates me, they're playing the Orpheum tonight. -♪ ...crazy, our best is yet unknown ♪ -[eerie music plays] ♪ This moment is ours to own... ♪ How is that even possible? I know, right? ♪ ...standing on the edge of great... ♪ -[man] Hello? What's up, dude? -It's Trevor. -Get me into the Orpheum tonight. -You got it. Plus one. Why do you hate me too? Only love, baby. Only love. [huffs] [sighs] Julie and I were thinking we'd start with "Stand Tall." Perfect. -Sounds good. -Sounds good? Dude, wake up! I wanna hear, "It sounds awesome." I know this isn't how we wanted things to turn out, but we gotta be all in tonight. This is our second chance at playing the Orpheum! I... I get it, I get it, but it's hard. Do we even know what's on the other side when we cross over? Do we all still get to hang together? You... You guys are the only family I have. [sentimental music plays] Yeah, I mean, I don't know what's gonna happen either, but... it's not like we have a choice. -[Reggie] Hmm. -[jolt buzzes] [all groan] [breathing heavily] [sighs] I'm pretty sure we do. And it rhymes with the Hollywood Ghost Club. Are you ready? What's wrong? Yeah. We just got rocked pretty hard by one of those jolt things. Pretty sure I ghost peed a little. But we're fine. [Julie] Actually, guys, I'm a little nervous. That's my sister having an actual conversation with her ghost band. Let's listen in. Luke, uh, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. [chuckles] What? Um... Can you do me a favor? Anything, Julie. You know that. [exhales slowly] When you cross over, if... if you happen to see my mom, can you tell her I love her... and... thank her for bringing you to me? Yeah, I will. [chuckles lightly] Band circle? Yeah. Guys, band circle. We don't know what brought us here, but... what we do know is, you're a star, Julie. [chuckles] And just because this is our last night together, it doesn't mean we won't be watching you from above... or... [chuckles] Now let's go rock this show. Let's give 'em a night they'll be talking about 'til the sun comes up. [all chuckle] Legends on three. -One. -Two. Three... [all] Legends. -[chuckling] -[horn honks] That's my dad. He's driving me there, so I'll see you guys soon. [chuckles lightly] -[exhales sharply] -[mysterious music plays] Have a good show, boy band. [chuckles] Who you calling boy band? [Ray] Carlos. How did he find out about us? I don't know, Reg. Maybe it was the blinds. Or you know what? The blanket. It could've been any number of things you did in that house. -It doesn't matter, you guys. -[car engine starts] We're not coming back here anyways. [ominous music plays] And where is it that you think you're going? What are you doing here? [gasps] Such hostility! I'm just here to congratulate you on your big night. [chuckling] Not everyone gets to play the Orpheum. No. OK, we know that it's your stamp that's hurting us. Hmm... We already told you, we have a band. We don't wanna join your little club. Yeah. And you can't make us either. [eerie music plays] [clears throat] Sir. [clicks tongue] Right. You're crossing over tonight. So exciting! Funny thing about the cross over, no one really knows what's waiting on the other side. But I know what's happening on this side. [wind howls] [rock riff plays] [laughs evilly] [suspenseful music plays] [bouncer] Ticket, please. [bouncer] Ticket, please. Hey, Julie, I've got your roadie. Come in. Holograms are good to go, boss. Best roadie ever. I'll be back in a few minutes to walk you to the stage. Thanks, Rob. You see this backstage pass? I had sushi with Brandon Urie! Good for you. I threw up in the car on the way over here. And you still look amazing. [chuckles] I made friends with the tech crew. You're gonna love what we have planned. The guys are here, right? I haven't seen them. Wait. You don't think they changed their mind and took Caleb's offer, do you? No. No, that's the last thing that they wanted. [sighs] You're gonna kill it. We should get some snacks. [chuckles] [haunting music plays] [ominous music plays] [all groan] [Alex] Uh... Well, don't you look nice? Sweet threads. How... How'd you know our sizes? That's your question? [clicks tongue, sighs] I know you boys aren't my biggest fans. And an eternity at my club might seem overwhelming. But... I just put you in sweet threads, so humor me this one last pitch. Now, for starters, isn't it nice that you're all here together? And believe me, everything you want, including Willie, is here. And on my stage, you don't vanish when the music stops. You soak in the applause for as long as you want. The connection that you will feel with that audience will be like no other. -I promise. -[distant cheering] Oh! Shh. Do you hear that? They're waiting for you. -[all groan] -[winces] That one looked like it hurt. Now, let me remind you, you don't know if playing the Orpheum is your unfinished business. Do you really have time to make that mistake? I suggest you accept my offer, because the clock is ticking. [all groan] -[groaning continues] -Ouch! You know where to find me. -[swing music plays] -[audience cheers] [Caleb] Ladies and gentlemen, I'm back!

[raucous applause, cheering] Hey, Julie, it's time. Just a second. Something's wrong. The boys were getting those jolts pretty bad as I was leaving. And they wouldn't stand me up again. They must have run out of time. I'm so sorry, Jules. They didn't cross over. -They're gone. -[mournful music plays] And I didn't even get to say goodbye. -[sniffles] -[runner knocks] Hey, Julie, you're on. Wait. [sniffles, sobs] What are you doing, Jules? Where is she going? Where do any of us really go? We've got a problem. [sighs heavily] [sobs gently] [sobs] I don't know if you can hear me, Mom, but... [sobs] ...I can't handle it. Flynn says you're supposed to be behind everything, but I don't know. If I was supposed to help the guys, I didn't. They're gone. [sobs] And I'm so sorry. They were my friends. My band. [sobs] My family. [sniffles] Why can't you just come pick me up... and... and hold me in your arms and just tell me that everything's gonna be OK and that I'm gonna get through it? [sobs] And that... [breathes shakily] That even though they're not here with me, they're still up there with you. I just wish you were here. [sobs] [sobs] [sobs, sniffles] [sighs] [indistinct chattering] [all giggle] -[women giggle] -Ladies. -[man] Trevor. -[women gasp] Guys. [exhales sharply] [panicked breathing] Let Panic know they are going on now. Signs. -[exhales sharply] -Wait. Where are you going? She's going on stage. Hold on. Julie just walked onto the stage. That's my girl! [announcer] Welcome to Live at the Orpheum. Now give it up for Julie and the Phantoms. [cheering, whistling] [giggling] [applause, cheering continue] [audience whistles] Hi. I'm Julie. Um... Tonight, I'd like to dedicate this song to my mom, who's been there with me every time I've played. And thank her for... not giving up on me. I'd also like to dedicate tonight's performance to... three special friends... who have changed my life completely, who have brought music back to me. It was their dream to play here, and... this is for them. This song is for anyone who's lost their way. Step into your greatness. Don't give up. Stand tall. Thank you.

Yeah, um, just give me a minute. OK, I'll wait up. Don't ghost me. [Ray chuckles] [door opens] Just a minute. -OK. -[kisses] -Love you. -Love you too. [sentimental music plays] [sighs] I... I know I already said this but, uh... thank you, guys. -[Reggie] You're welcome. -[Alex groans] [Luke] Dude! [Alex groans] [coughing, groaning] Why... Why are you here? I... I thought... -[jolt buzzes] -[guys groan, cough] No... no! I thought you crossed over. Why didn't you cross over? I guess playing the Orpheum wasn't our unfinished business. Point Caleb. We wanted you to think that we crossed over, so we pretended to. We just... We had nowhere else to go. [sobs] We thought you'd go straight to bed. Yeah, well, I knew she was gonna come out here, but nobody ever listens to me. -[jolt buzzes] -[groaning] You have to save yourselves right now. Go join Caleb's club. Please. It's better than not existing at all. Please just go. Go! Poof out! Do something! Please. Do it for me. -Please. -We're not going back there. [breathing heavily] No music is worth making, Julie, if we're not making it with you. No regrets. [breathes shakily] [Julie sniffles] [both sniffle, sob] [sniffles] I love you guys. [exhales slowly] [mystical twinkling] [uplifting music plays] How can I feel you? I... I... I don't know. [gasps] I... [chuckles] I feel stronger. Alex, Reggie, come. [mystical twinkling] [all sniffle] [gasps] Whoa... I... I... I don't feel as weak anymore. -[Luke chuckles] -Yeah, me neither. Not that, you know, I was ever that weak. [all chuckle] -[mystical twinkling] -[Julie] What... What do you think that means? [chuckles] I think the band's back. [Reggie chuckles] You guys think we could try that hug thing one more time? -[all chuckle] -Yeah. [Alex] Hugs are good. [all chuckle] I like this. [chuckles] [Julie] Me too. -[Julie] Aww! -[all chuckle] [Julie] We played the Orpheum! Whoo!
