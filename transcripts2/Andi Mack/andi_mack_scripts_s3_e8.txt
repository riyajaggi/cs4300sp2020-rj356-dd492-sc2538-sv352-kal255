I'm just gonna do a quick walk-by, make sure he's okay. Buffy broke girl code. What exactly is the code? You don't go out with someone after they been with your best friend.

 I knew something felt off. Now you know what. How did that happen? How did what happen? Andi's in a canoe with Amber. You are using my charger. Hey! Take your 2% and hit the bricks. How do you even know that's your charger? See the pink tape wrapper around the plug? I marked it to avoid this exact situation. Well, where's my charger? Oh, good. You found it. This one... Also has pink tape on it.

 Huh. Is anyone missing a charger? I found one with pink tape on it. You put pink tape on all the chargers, didn't you?

Oh! What is this? Open it. "You are cordially invited to the first annual. DanceDance Film Festival." What's that? DanceDance is like Sundance. Except it takes place in my living room and only shows dance movies. Ooh. Tell me the lineup. Center Stage, Save the Last Dance, Step Up, one through four, Step Up 3D... Twice because, it's the best one. Obviously. And Footloose. Me and my Sunday shoes are in. Good. Because it's been way too long since we hung out. Just the two of us. Oh no. What? This says tomorrow night. I have plans tomorrow night. With who? Amber. Oh. Well, what about tonight? I have plans tonight. With who? Walker. Oh. Amber's taking me to a party. I'm sure you could come. I don't want to tag along to a party I wasn't invited to. Well, we'll do it another time. I was just about to say that. What about next weekend? Let's make a plan. I never thought we'd have to make a plan. I know. What are we? 20? - Yep. - Yeah. Will you hold my foot? You want me to massage it? Nah. Just hold it. I feel like we're an old married couple. Okay, fine. Don't hold my foot. No, I like it. Imagining us... As an old married couple. We'd be pretty cute. Swiping sugar packets from restaurants. Driving 30 miles an hour down the freeway. With the blinker on, just... You'll look good with grey hair. I could see you as a grandma. Ugh! That was a little too real. Yeah, we need to get out more. - Tomorrow! - What's tomorrow? Oh, Andi's spending the night at Amber's. We could do something. Ohh. Okay. I got this. What do ya got? An idea. I'll plan the whole thing. It'll be a surprise. - Really? - Mh-hm. Okay. This is exciting. Nothing too fancy though, okay? I am not saying a thing. Oh. Keeping it a total mystery, huh? That's fine with me. As long as it's not that rock climbing wall. You're no fun. Or... Maybe I'm a lot of fun. You'll just have to wait and see. ♪ If you need me ♪ Hold my foot. ♪ All I wanted was to let our love grow ♪ ♪ Come on baby, take me away ♪ ♪ Come on baby, take me away ♪ See? Told you I had a ping pong table in my basement. Why didn't you believe me? 'Cause you've never mentioned it until 30 minutes ago. Well, until recently, my stepdad was using it to play with his Civil War figurines. This morning, it was the Battle of Shiloh. That sounds cool. Yeah... Kind of. It's mostly just... - I'd rather do this. - Yeah, me too. Play to 11? It's your table. - One, zero. - Nice! - Alright. - Yeah. Agh! Two, zero. I haven't played in a while, okay? It's your serve. Ooh! Three, zero! It's a massacre! Hey, niceburg! Is this real or are you letting him win? Oh, it's real. Tell him, Jonah. - You wanna play? - I'll take winner. Here you go. I just remembered, I'm supposed to be somewhere. Where? Um... Haircut! Are you upset that I'm winning? No, of course not. Ooh, I think he is upset. Look at that face he's pulling. That's because you're here, if you want to know. Hey, that thing that happened with T.J. and his friends, we worked that out. It's got nothing to do with that. Then, what is it? Ask him. What is it? What did you do? I have no idea. Why didn't you tell me T.J. was coming? I didn't think I had to. You like everyone, everyone likes you. T.J.'s kinda between friends right now. I can't help you. I'll never be friends with that guy. Why not? Long story. That's... Kind of embarrassing. Come on. JB. It's CG. It goes all the way back to Little League. Little League? Were you two rivals or something? The opposite, actually. We were on the same team. I love baseball. I thought that was going to be my sport. I wanted to be a legend like Roberto Clemente. I even got his number, 21, on my jersey. But I never got to wear that jersey. Somebody stole it. Care to guess who that somebody was? T.J.? - Yeah. - Why? - Let me finish. - Please do. I very politely tell him... "That's my jersey." He's like, "No, it's not. It's mine." I say, "Ask the coach." But T.J. refuses, so... I say, "I'll ask the coach." Then T.J. goes: "Is the coach your dad?" It just so happened my dad was the coach. Ooh, I was afraid you were gonna say that. "Wittle baby has to wun and get his daddy! He's angwee." And I was angwee! I mean, angry. So I yelled, "Just give me back my jersey!" "Oh, is Wittle Baby gonna cwy now?" Did you cry? There's no crying in baseball. That's not an actual rule. Yes, it is. That's just a line from a movie. Are you and I going to fight about this now? No, no. Sorry. What did you do? I shoved him. He shoved me back. The other kids were yelling, "Fight, fight, fight!" "Fight, fight, fight, fight!" We didn't fight. - The coach... - Your dad. Right. He put a stop to it. He needed the team to get along. He said it would help if I just wore another jersey. So I did, but... Every game, I had to see T.J. wearing my number. So, what happened the next year? I didn't go back. I never played Little League again. Or basketball or football. Why not? I didn't want to be on a team with T.J. or any of his friends. I mean, he became this star athlete. So did you. On the Space Otters. I love Ultimate, but... It would have been nice to play a real sport. You always say Ultimate is a real sport. Yeah. But, come on. So, this was never resolved? No, and I know what you're thinking. This is a stupid grudge and I should have gotten over it by now. No. No, it's not stupid. Clearly, this was and important moment in your life. Without it, you might have been a completely different person. What do you mean? Think about it. You're the nicest person anyone's ever met. Maybe it's because you don't want anyone to feel the way you did that day. I don't. The question is: Why did T.J. do it? He's mean. He's always been mean. Eh, it's just his face. He's really not so mean anymore. You know, this is the first time I ever talked about this. I'm glad we had this conversation. Me too. I'm ready to let it go. I'm not. So, what's the latest on the whole Buffy-Walker situation? Still a situation. Girl Code's still being broken? Technically, I guess. Although, I don't know, maybe some of this girl stuff is not so cut and dry. Maybe it should be called, Girl Recommendations or Girl Loose Guidelines. That's the one problem with Girl Code. A little too open to interpretation. It should come with a label. "The following codes are merely suggestions." Girl Code may result in nausea, insecurity, loss of sleep, and weight gain. "Be careful when using Girl Code." "Girl Code is not available in all 50 states." Results may vary. "If side effects occur, please consult your other girlfriends." - Where are we? - You'll see. This is the party? Yeah, isn't it cool? It's a warehouse. So? I'm used to parties with silly string, accessible bathrooms and my mother DJ'ing! That guys has a beard. Welcome to your first high school party. This is a high school party? I'm not ready for a high school party. Don't worry, Bambi. I'll protect you. - Isn't this cool? - What? Are you having fun? You will! I was just like you the first time I came. Come on! Oh. Okay, excuse me. Oh! Amber. We got separated. Sorry. I've always wanted to do this. I know. Sorry it took 15 years. It was worth the wait. Yeah? Agh. It's, uh... It's Andi. "I'm at a warehouse party. I lost Amber. I don't know how to get home." What? She... She dropped a pin. Excuse me, sir. Can you take us to this address? Rerouting. What is she doing at a warehouse party? Let's focus on the good news. She texted us. She wants us to come get her. Is this as fast as we can go? I can't believe I'm finally on a carriage ride the one night I don't want to be on a carriage ride. Alright. Don't worry. I got this. Excuse me, drive. Stop please. Please stop. What are you gonna do? Run. Text me when you find her. I will. Bowie! What? You're killing it as a dad. Go get our girl. What took you so long? I ran all the way here. Why didn't you drive? Thanks for coming to rescue me, Dad. You're my hero, Dad. That too. Let's get out of here. Andi? What's going on? Are-Are you leaving? Um... You better believe she's leaving. We thought she was staying at your place. She never said anything about a party. I'm just glad we put that spyware on your phone. That's how we found you. Don't blame Andi. I'm the one who brought... Nice try, Amber. But Andi makes her own decisions. She's gonna have to face the consequences for those decisions. I'm sorry. - It's okay. - Let's go, young lady. Call your mother! She's worried sick. And the Oscar goes to you. That was so believable. I had no idea you could act. I meant it. All of what I just said. Wait. You're mad at me? No. I'm not mad at you, exactly. I just don't want to think of you at parties like this and now I have to. But, I was responsible. I mean, I knew I shouldn't be in there. And I texted you. You did. And you should always, always do that. But what you should never do it be there in the first place. I need to be able to trust you. And right now, at this moment, I don't. Did you hear that? I did. And I'm sorry. I won't do it again, I promise. That was my dad talking. I just turned into my dad. Actually... I think you just turned into my dad. ♪ Don't ever put out ♪ ♪ The fire you bring ♪ ♪ The heavens still sing ♪ - Call your mother. - Oh. Okay, Dad. Nevermind. Here she is. - Where? - There. What? Need a lift? What is with the horse-drawn carriage? Wait. Were you two on a date? Did I ruin your evening? I feel horrible. A buggy ride? I have the cutest parents. Uh! This is so much better than a party in a warehouse. That's crazy. Hey. That never happened. It doesn't matter. We don't need to do this. Well, I don't want you going around your whole life thinking I stole your Little League jersey! But you did! I did not! What if I told you that there was a way that we could settle this debate, once and for all? How? Did you know the Little League organization you both played for has a website? So? Well, on that website, are photos of all the previous Little League teams. Including yours. - I told you! - I told you! It's 21. It is 21. Oh, no. Ah, man. This is embarrassing. When I look at this jersey, I see a 12. It's clearly 21. To you. To most people. But... I have a learning disability. It's a kind of dyslexia, but with numbers instead of words. Oh. I didn't know I had it back then. I only found out a few months ago. I'm sorry. What? No, I owe you the apology. And I owe you one too. For holding on to this stupid grudge for so long. I never even thanked you for helping me at Cyrus's Bar Mitzvah party. That was the most scared I've ever been in my life. Yeah. What was going on then? Panic attack. I get those now. Everyone's got something they got to deal with. Fear of flamingos. Both real and plastic. Hey! Hey. So, how was the party? It was like being in a crowded subway car, in a steam room, with speakers right here doing this all night: Sounds fun. It wasn't. This is fun. You are fun. I was hoping... that the DanceDance Film Festival was still happening. Oh, yeah. That'll be going all night. Do you think we'll still be doing this when we're 20? I hope. But that's like, 100 years from now. ♪ 'Cause I want it all ♪ Synchronized by srjanapala ♪ Wrapped up and tied ♪ ♪ I want the world ♪ ♪ I'm gonna make it mine ♪ ♪ Whatever's hot ♪ ♪ Sparkle and shine ♪ ♪ I want it now ♪ ♪ I want it, Yeah I want it ♪ ♪ 'Cause I want it now ♪ Synchronized by srjanapala ♪ I want it now ♪ Next on Andi Mack... You know that Jefferson has a secret society? One of you is going to be invited to join. Which one? I don't know. I shouldn't even be telling you this. But I wanted you to be prepared. I knew this is what would happen. Buffy! I just said, I wanna buy a wedding dress. You should be melting. - Whoa. - There's more. Bex, this is the one. I wish Andi were here. - Andi! - Andi!
