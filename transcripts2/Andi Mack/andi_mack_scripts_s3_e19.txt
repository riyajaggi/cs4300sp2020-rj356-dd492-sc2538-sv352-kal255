 Previously, on "Andi Mack"... Shadyside Academy of Visual Arts. SAVA. I think you were right about this place. I really wanna go here. You still think I can get in, right? Of course. Amber figured out that I'm not giving you chess lessons. Great. Okay, now I need some other excuse why I can't hang out with her. I have an idea.

 - Amber! - Amber! Why don't you just break up with me? I hope we can still be friends. What are you, reading from cue cards? Buffy? - Marty. - Are you okay? I'm fine. Just a cramp. We did it. Marty! What's up with the limp? It's getting better. Who are you texting? It's the name and number of a foot doctor. I don't need to see a doctor.

 Well, you do. Did someone text Buffy? Yes, she's on her way. She said she's coming from an appointment. An appointment? What kind? Her hair appointment isn't until next week. And she just had her teeth cleaned. You guys are really close. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey. - When did you? - How did you? What is that? A stress fracture, That sounds bad. How did that happen? They're very common. People get them all the time from repeating movements in their everyday lives. But I did this to myself by running a marathon without training. You're an overachiever even when it comes to your injuries. So what about basketball? Are you still going to be able to play? Yeah. - Great. - Good. Phew.

Hey, speedy. What are you doing, you weirdo? Giving you a ride to class. I heard about your foot. That's rough. It's okay. Tell your face. Fine. It's not okay. It's the worst. The Spikes have one more game this season and I can't play. I can barely walk. I just got passed by a caterpillar. So hop in already. Second bell is about to ring. Do I wanna ask where you got this? Nope. Fasten your seatbelt. Leggo! It was so nice of him. I mean, T.J. used to be the worst. - And now he's the best? - Hmm. And who was perceptive enough to see the good in him first? Don't pull a muscle patting yourself on the back, Cyrus. I'll do it the normal way, when I floss. Looks like Amber is still struggling. Because of me? What else could it be? An existential crisis? A what? It's when you write a lot of bad poetry. Whatever it is, it's coming our way. Could I talk to you for a minute? Amber, I'm sorry I did such a bad job breaking up. - I didn't mean to... - Stop. Don't. It's done. There's just one thing I need from you now. Sure. Anything. I need you stop coming to The Spoon. Oh. Look, it makes me sad to see you. And even sadder to see other people seeing me sad. Also, let's face it. Nobody tips a bummed-out waitress. Okay, sure. I'll... I'll stay away. It won't be for long. I hope. I'll leave now. Is everything okay? Amber needs some space. From me. They kill me. "Oh, hello." Ah. Hey. Something on your mind? I finished my application to SAVA. - Andi, that's fantastic. - But... I'm not sure I'm going to submit it. That seems like an important step in the process. What if I'm not one of the five percent? What if they're not dazzled by lamps made out of old CDs? I don't respond to ridiculous questions. What do you think? Hey, I get it. I trust your judgment. "You trust my judgment"? And I not supposed to? You're supposed to say that I'm talented. And that you believe in me. And that this school would be crazy not to want me. Well, of course they'd be crazy. Well, there's the right answer. Or it would have been. Seven seconds ago. Hey, if they don't accept you, it's because they're pretentious and stuck up and wrong. So you don't think I'll get in? That's not what I said. But it's what I heard. Why didn't you just tell her she's gonna get in? Because what if she doesn't? As the man said to the horse: Why the long face? I got a summons to appear in Student Court tomorrow. What's Student Court? And why wasn't I asked to be on it? Sorry, back to your thing. It's a group of students who figure out your punishment if you did something wrong. Mr. Bag is making me go. Because you took his golf cart? It's a long walk to the P. E. field and I guess he really depends on those cup holders. But you just did it to help Buffy. You were being a nice guy! Yeah, a nice guy who might now get suspended, or even kicked off the basketball team. It's that serious? Then I'm gonna be your lawyer. Well it's not that type of court. People don't have lawyers. They do now. - But you're not gonna... - Listen, I'd love to keep arguing about this, but I gotta pick out a suit. Boo! What was that? Nothing... yet. I have to make a decision. Ugh. About what? Well... I don't want to tell you, because it might not happen. And if it doesn't, and everybody knows, it'll be that much worse. This probably makes no sense. Makes perfect sense. I have those conversations with myself all the time. Really? Well, in that case... without knowing anything about it, should I do it or not? Huh. Without knowing anything about it? Except that it seems to make you tense and nervous. I'd say... no. You would? If you wanted to say yes, you wouldn't be asking me this question. No. No. I think... I think you're right. I feel less stressed already. I'm going to do it. Thanks. You really helped. - I did? - Now, you need to go so I can not do it. Sent? Oh, no. I did it. So it's true. You have broken foot? No. I have a mild narrowing of the second metatarsal, indicative of a stress fracture. Which means the chances of winning our last game have majorly narrowed to zero. We were getting so close! I thought that this time we actually had a shot. We do. Kaitlin, the team is light years ahead of where they used to be. Plus, I made this. - What is it? - A playbook. It's my way of helping out from the bench. What are all these circles and letters? The players. Am I on here? I know it looks confusing, but once we run the drills, it won't be. Buffy, I know this team is important to you. It's important to us, too, but... I don't know what this is. Only that it's not gonna be the same as having you on the court. You won't even give it a shot? I'm sorry. Boot! The court will come to order. Wait! Wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait! What is all that? Evidence. Actually, old phone books. It's an intimidation tactic that I learned on TV. I'm not letting you get kicked off the basketball without a fight. We're all here? Let's begin. The court is in session. Lead council for the defense, Cyrus Goodman, Your Honor. You've retained counsel, Mr. Kippen? This is highly unusual. One moment. We'll allow it. Thank you, Your Honors. T.J., a complaint has been filed against you for... "Grand Theft Golf Cart." Hearsay. Why don't you tell us what happened? Well, I saw Buffy Driscoll limping across the athletic field and I wanted to help her. A testament to his character. So then I saw Mr. Bag's golf cart... Unclearly marked... And, you know, figured he wouldn't miss it for, like, ten minutes... Only seven and a half according to key witnesses... So I borrowed it to get Buffy to class on time. In accordance with the school's overly-strict attendance policy, which, I think we can all agree, is a crime in and of itself. I think we have everything we need. We'll go think about this - and we'll get back... - Ahem! Hold on. I'd like to call a witness. Mr. Goodman, you're showboating. Thank you for noticing, Your Honor. I call to the stand... - myself. - Oh no. Mr. Goodman, where were you at the time of the alleged incident? Well, I wasn't there. But I know that T.J. only did it to be a good friend. So you're a witness, but you didn't see the crime in question? I'm a character witness... sir. Can we speed this up? I don't think so. Come in. - Hey! - Hi! - Hi! - Hi! - Hi! What's going on? We're having our end-of-season party. But the season hasn't ended yet. Well, after we get creamed at our last game, we may not feel like partying. So... As your team captain, I find that attitude disappointing. But... As a human being, I find cupcakes delicious! Here. These look so good. Cupcake down! No! Guess what came in the mail? I'll return it. I just wanted to see how it looked on me. Uh... okay. But I meant this. A postcard from SAVA. It says they received Andi's application. Oh, she did it! She applied! She's going after her dreams. More importantly, I didn't destroy her self-esteem. Less importantly, but still important. I wonder why she didn't tell us. She didn't want us to know. But we do know, huh? Yeah, but she doesn't know we know. Put it back in the mailbox. We'll let her find it. We pretend we never saw it? If she wants us to know, she'll show it to us. And if she doesn't? Well, like I said... I might have dented her self-esteem, but I didn't destroy it. Who wants to watch some video my mom took at our games? Yeah! Seriously, they're hilarious! - Sure. - All right. Oh, this was last week's game. I'm so terrible. Maybe this was a bad idea. Wait, that wasn't terrible. That was really close. In fact, most of your shots are close. But look, go back. See? You close your eyes when you shoot. Huh. I never noticed that. Stop doing that, and I guarantee your shooting percentage will go up. And Maria... so, you're great at getting open. But you never call out to let your teammates know. Yeah. You guys are better than you think. With or without me. The Spikes are a good team. Good enough to win our last game? Maybe. But if you want it, you have to fight for it. Are you ready to fight for it? - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! All right, show us you playbooks. One for you... One for you... Yeah, they're really heavy, I know. Win or lose, we are warriors. And what are we gonna do today? - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. I can't hear you. - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. - Fight. Yeah, we are! ♪ Yeah, I ain't playing around ♪ ♪ I'ma take your crown ♪ ♪ Man, better run I'ma hunt you down ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm gonna hunt you down ♪ You got this, Spikes. Come on! ♪ I'ma take your crown ♪ Let's go, girls! Come on, you got this. Get in! ♪ I'm gonna hunt you down ♪ ♪ Yeah, I ain't playing around ♪ ♪ I'ma take your crown ♪ ♪ Man, better run gonna hunt you down ♪ Keep those eyes open, Kaitlin! Only two, guys! Come on, Maria! Shoot! ♪ Aim for the stars never settle for the moon ♪ I'm so proud of you guys. - You did it! - Buffy! - You did it! - Congratulations. - Amazing! - What a good captain. Thanks. This is the best game I ever... Never played. Hey. The court reached a verdict. Will the defendant please rise? Not you, Mr. Goodman. I think you know me by now, Your Honor. We find the defendant, T.J. Kippen... guilty on all counts. The system is broken! We demand an appeal. - Dude, stop fighting. - I'll never stop. You did your best. This part I have to face by myself. We hereby sentence you to the harshest punishment allowable by this court. I'm ready. Lunchtime detention on Monday. That's it? That's the harshest punishment you're allowed to give? Guys, it's just student court. We don't even have the authority to touch the thermostat in here. Will you visit me while I'm on the inside? I'll bake you a cake with a hall pass in it. Court is adjourned. We have to get these robes back to the choir. Jonah? When I said don't come to The Spoon, I kinda meant this patch out here, too. I'm not gonna stay. Just... Something happened. I really wanna tell you. What? My dad found a new job. A pretty good one. Jonah. That's great. And my parents rented an apartment. We're moving in next week. I'm really glad for you. I know how tough it's been. You were the one person I wanted to tell. You got me through this, Amber. You were there for me, too. I'm gonna go. Hey, Jonah. You want a milkshake? Sure. Wait here. I'll bring it out to you. Want a ride? Well someone learned nothing from his time in the system. What can I say? I live on the edge. Well, I live in the middle. Cool. I'll drive you there. What happens if we get caught? You know what happens. I guess I could skip a lunch. - Buckle up. - Yeah. ♪ ♪ All right, let's go fast. Let's go. Drift, drift, drift! Here she comes. She's got the mail. And she found the postcard. Okay, places. I love this episode. "You gotta see the baby!" You guys watch a lot of TV. No we don't. We'd rather talk to you. How was your day? Okay. Anything happen? Any news? Usual, usual. Oh, wait. Something did happen. The Spikes won their first game ever! Buffy couldn't play, but she was an awesome captain. Great. Call me when dinner's ready. - Uh-huh. - Yep. She didn't tell us. It's not your fault. That's just the way it is. Kids don't tell their parents everything. We didn't. I know. I just thought we were different. I guess we're not. Sync corrections by srjanapala Next on Andi Mack... I can't believe! This is the first thing I've ever won! - Thank you. - What did you win? Oh, a car! - Flying lessons? - It's not flying lessons. - All-new furniture? - What's wrong with our furniture? A Hawaiian vacation? Stop guessing. You're gonna make the thing I actually did win seem not as cool as it is. You gonna be okay for tomorrow afternoon? I wanna be, but my dad got a new job and we rented an apartment. We're moving tomorrow morning. And I don't know how long it's gonna take. We'll help you. Buffy! Buffy! You gotta see this. You were doing so well.
