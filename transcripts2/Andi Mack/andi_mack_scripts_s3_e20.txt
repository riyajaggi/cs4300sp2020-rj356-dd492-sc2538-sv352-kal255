 Previously, on "Andi Mack"... - Hey. - What is that? A stress fracture. I did this to myself by running a marathon without training. Sometime last year, my dad made an investment. I guess it went extremely bad. Had to declare bankruptcy. I think of that as a board game word. Except, you lose your actual house. Did you get my email?

 What am I looking at? Shadyside Academy of Visual Arts. SAVA! Do you know what this place is? It's an art school. It's a high school. You should apply. I think you were right about this place. I really want to go here. What's that? Should I do it or not? I'd say... no. No. Sent? Oh, no!

 Welcome to the first, and probably only, Great American Toast-Off. I'm your judge Cyrus Goodman, and... Who are you talking to? Just trying to set the scene. Geez! Jonah, we'll start with you. Tell me what you've done with your toast. I burnt it. A-ha. - I see. - Toasters are the trickiest appliance in the kitchen. And now, a taste. I wouldn't. Buffy, eager to see your creation. Bread, butter, heat. I call it "Deconstructed Toast." Guys, all you had to do was make toast. Jonah was using the toaster! Okay, my turn. My turn. If what you have under here is toast, you win. Show off. She won. She definitely won. Uh, it's not an official win until I've tasted it. Hmm. Perfect browning. Good crunch. And something else. What am I tasting? - Glue. - Hmm? Did I win? ♪ I'm standin' on the edge ♪ ♪ And everything I know-oh-oh is blown away ♪ ♪ Life is upside down ♪ ♪ But any way it goes-oh-oh I'll work it out ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Here we go ♪ - ♪ One, two, three ♪ - ♪ I'm ready for tomorrow ♪ ♪ Tomorrow starts today ♪ ♪ There ain't a map to follow ♪ ♪ But I'm with you all the way ♪ ♪ I'm ready for tomorrow ♪ - ♪ Tomorrow starts today ♪ - ♪ Hey ♪ "Andi Mack" - ♪ There ain't a map to follow ♪ - - ♪ Hey ♪ "Andi Mack" - ♪ But I'm with you all the way ♪ - ♪ Hey ♪ Season 03 Episode 19 ♪ All the way ♪ Title: "A Moving Day" Oh, found a corner! Ohh! Found another corner! I can't believe it. This is the first thing I've ever won! Thank you! Okay. So we'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Thank you again. What did you win? - Oh, a car! - Flying lessons. - Ooh, flying lessons. - It's not flying lessons. - All-new furniture. - What's wrong with our furniture? Seriously? - Hawaiian vacation! - Stop guessing. You're gonna make the thing I actually did win seem not as cool as it is. What did you win? What did you win? You guys have heard of Raoul Ricci, right? - I have not. - Nope. - Who? - The chef. Raoul Ricci. With the four-star restaurants. He's a super-famous chef who just, like, quit one day and said he'd never open another restaurant, and then basically went off and became a hermit. Is he the prize? Did we win a hermit? Kind of a cool prize, actually. The prize is, he still loves to cook. So you put your name on a list, and every so often he picks someone to come to his home and he cooks them a once-in-a-lifetime meal! None of you have ever heard of this? It must be hard to find a good publicist if you're a hermit. I shouldn't have said "hermit." He's more of a recluse. So, he's a hermit with a phone? Okay, look. This is a big deal. People come from all over the world for this opportunity. I'm going, and you're all invited, but if you don't want to come... Of course we're coming, especially now that you have us dying of curiosity. Where does he live? On Mount Washington. Ooh! In one of those mansions? Well, by "on" I didn't mean "on top. " He's more of "in the middle." Oh, in a cave? No, it's not a cave... anymore. Okay, you know what? This is not for me. I have a refrigerator. I don't need to go to this much trouble to eat. Well, whatever you want, Mom. But you do realize you're gonna have to listen to the rest of us rhapsodize about this for, well, ever. I'll survive. Come on, you guys. I need two more corners. You know what? This is not for me, this puzzle. - You know what? We have a TV. - Yeah. You know what... We do not need to go to this much trouble - to have fun. - Okay. I get it. So, if I go to lunch in a cave, you'll help me with my puzzle? Is that the deal? - Yes. - That's the deal. - I'll take it. - Yay! On one condition. We're gonna need a bigger puzzle. This food better be really, really good. Yeah. Guys, I can walk faster. This is actually my preferred pace. - How's it feeling? - Fine. Are you gonna be okay for tomorrow afternoon? 'Cause we have that thing. I just said it's fine. I'll be there. I don't know if I will. - What? - You have to be there. I want to be, but my dad got a new job and we rented an apartment. Jonah, that's great! Yeah, things are looking up. Except we're moving tomorrow morning, and I don't know how long it's gonna take. So, I might have to miss the thing. Not an option. We'll help you. Can you? Stop coddling me. Look, I can lift Cyrus. And I can hold the door open while Buffy is lifting Cyrus-sized things. That's great. Thanks, guys. I'll see you tomorrow. This is nice. Mom, we good? You know where you're going? I've got my map. We're all set. My visor, please. - Oh, cute. - Thanks. It's new. Mom, come on! Oh, I need my sunglasses. - Nope. These are the wrong ones. - What? - Mom! - I like those. What's wrong with those? Oh, found them. Great. Can we please go? As soon as you stop whining. I'm not whining! Okay.

It's just over the next rise. - Maybe we took a wrong turn. - We didn't. - That last fork back there... - We're almost there. You could at least come up with a new lie. Is there a map? Yes, there is a map. So, show us the map. See? Map. - Why can't we see it? - Because we're lost. - Are we lost. - We're not lost. We're obviously lost. I got this. Hey. You know you can trust me, right? Of course. So, what's really going on here? If you tell me, I'll keep it to myself. They're just looking for a little reassurance. About what? That you know what you're doing. You know you can trust me, right? Of course. Then do that. What did she say? I need a reason not to turn around and go home. I promised I wouldn't say anything.
