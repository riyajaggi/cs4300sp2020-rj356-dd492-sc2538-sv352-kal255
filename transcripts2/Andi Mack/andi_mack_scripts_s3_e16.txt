Are you getting married? - No. - What's this? - It's from your mom. - It's us. - The night we got engaged.

 Oh, whoa. Aah. Welcome to our sidewalk sale, where nothing is for sale. It's all free. Somebody was just throwing all these clothes away. Who? - Mint Chip. - And which one of you is Mint Chip? I still don't get what we did wrong. We took those clothes out of a dumpster. We picked up trash, and our punishment is... picking up trash. You call this community service? I'm doing hard time in an allergy minefield. - My foot is killing me. - Did anyone bring sunblock? Wait. I did. I didn't think this would be so hard. They don't sentence people to 20 hours of fun.

 You guys finding good stuff? I just found this kite. - It's garbage. - Who looks at garbage? I found some used diapers. I regret looking. Ooh! A pile of paper towel tubes. Okay if I grab these? Knock yourself out. I am surrounded by craft supplies. Wait. We get to keep this stuff.

Wait, we were only working for three hours? Time does not fly when you're wearing a reflective vest. Oh, come on, guys. It was not that bad. Really? Your trash gets a seat at the table? - Well, where you see trash... - We all see trash. I don't. I see treasure. I'll be back. Hurry up, so we can order, okay? - Hi, there. - Hey. I don't know if you'd be interested, but I called into a radio show - and won some tickets. - You did? - Before you get too excited... - Too late for that. - They're tickets to Racer's Edge. - Yes! - What is it? - A go-kart track. - Want to go? - I would love you... to! - I would love to. - I didn't expect you to be so excited. It's just you, me, and... the smell of rubber. That's all I've ever wanted. Minus the smell. Breaking news: Buffy is hungry. Hangry. I'm hangry. Here you go. We haven't even ordered yet. It's a... preliminary estimate. - How can you estimate if we haven't... - Just take it. She really needs to find a different line of work. - I should go talk to her. - About what? Oh, uh, this estimate is way off. I'll be quick. Watch my bag. Great. No food, and now, we're trash-sitting. - What's going on? - Jonah asked me to go-kart with him. Congratulations! I guess? Is that why I'm here? I told him, "I love you." You said those words? Not intentionally. It just kind of slipped out. But guess what? He smiled. Well, that's just what he does. He's the only known person with resting happy face. But the point is, he didn't go... Fantastic! He did not make those faces. - Is that why I'm here? - What if I said it for real? Told him, I love you. Okay, so that's why I'm here. I don't know if that's such a good idea. I take that back. I do know that's not such a good idea. But how could it ever be a bad thing to tell someone you love them? Well, if he doesn't say it back...? It doesn't matter. I want to say it. And if I want to say it, I should be able to say it, right? - Well, I mean, theoretically, but... - But I'm gonna do it! I feel so much better knowing you think it's a good idea. - Have you seen my "Don't Hate, Meditate" T-shirt? Nope. I thought I left it... In my defense, it was just laying around looking so soft and comfy, - what else could I do? - Not a very compelling defense. I throw myself on the mercy of the court. Where's your ring? Oh. It's right there. I took it off so it wouldn't fall down the drain. Should we still be wearing these? Yeah. Why wouldn't we wear these? They're engagement rings and... we're not engaged anymore. Well, not technically, but we gave each other great rings because we love each other. Why would we ever take them off? Yeah, you're right. Let's keep them. You know, this doesn't mean you can keep my T-shirt, right? - Mm, just keep hugging. - Okay. So, each of you has a slip of paper with your classmate's name on it. When you look at that person, what's the first thing you notice? Physical appearance, right? But we're all so much more than that. In this exercise, I want each of you to describe yourself as that person, but... without saying a name, or what you look like. Who would like to go first? I'll go. This sounds fun. Oh. I moved here from Philadelphia. I am a gamer, and I read graphic novels. - That's... That's me. - Harris Gurney. Well-done, Andi. You're next. No-brainer. I'm the coolest girl at Jefferson. Kristina. I don't know this person well. I threw a really cool party once. Um, I'm probably good with computers. And I play the violin or piano? - Is it Andi? - No, that's... that's not me. Andi Mack. Tina described me, it was like, this girl's Asian, so here's a list of all the Asian girl things she must do. And then the whole class guessed "Andi!" right away because... Asian. - Even the kids who know you? - Maybe that's how they see me. Ms. Frankel used it as a teachable moment about stereotypes, which was about as much fun as it sounds. What about the school dress code protest, Kristina? You're wearing leggings, you have me to thank for that. She probably thought she was complimenting you. People say hurtful things without even realizing it. I've known some of these kids since kindergarten. It's just so weird to think that when they were looking at me, they were never really seeing me. That's the most upsetting part of it. It's horrible. But what are you gonna do about it? Something. Details to come. What smells so delicious? Four-cheese lasagna. - Say it again. - Four... cheese... lasagna. Where's Andi? She's doing her project in AndiShack. So it's just gonna be you and me. Oh. A romantic dinner for the newly-not-weds? Oh, that reminds me... What do you think we should do with... this? Oh, I want to keep that. Don't you? Of course. But where? Hmm? Oh, I don't know. It's so visible. Well, I don't want it to be invisible. - Maybe Andi would want it in her room? - Yeah! - Yeah? - We should probably ask her first. Uh... That's the cheese calling. You're still hungry, right? Hmm? Uh, yeah. Mm. Mmm! Hey. Come in. It's gonna be one heck of a bracelet. This is going to be big, Cyrus. - It's going to be big. - A big what? Well, that I don't know yet. All I know is that it's going to be... Big, right. Got it. I brought the things you asked for. Here's the prison outfit. The social experiment wristbands. The wig that I wore at your party. This is great. Oh, what about The Spoon? Did you bring anything from The Spoon? You already have so much. Do you really need more? Well, I don't know yet if I need it. All I know is that I might need it. ♪ What I feel now, behind the wheel now ♪ ♪ Like I could fly in the sky, it's so real now ♪ ♪ I got control now, rock and roll now ♪ ♪ A heightened state in my soul now ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm on fire ♪ ♪ Yeah, and I'm no liar, baby ♪ ♪ Yeah, I'm burnin' rubber ♪ ♪ Ha-ha! ♪ You lapped me. How did you do that? - Have you done this before? - Never. I just like to go fast. That's cool. You are... so fun to hang out with. So are you. You're, like, the most fun person I've ever hung out with. Like, I would hang out with you every day if I could. I love you. - What? - I said... I love you. "Round two"? That's exactly what I said. The takeaway is, don't tell someone you love them on a go-kart track. Honestly, maybe it's for the best. I mean, you can always tell Jonah that you love him, but you can never un-tell him. That's true. And I really don't want to mess it up with him this time. You're not. You just had a great date. Focus on that. Yeah. You're very wise. I know. - Bye. - Bye. ♪ If you ask me how the world should be ♪ ♪ Then people would live in harmony ♪ ♪ Oh, what a beautiful world ♪ ♪ What a beautiful world ♪ - Hey. - Hey. Do you have a Frisbee you could spare? I need one for this thing I'm making. Sure. What color? - Uh... blue? - I only have green. Oh. Perfect. Thanks. Uh, I'm procrastinating. Do you wanna split a milkshake at The Spoon? No. Amber might be working. Are you avoiding her? Yeah. Why? She loves me. - How do you know that? - She told me... at the go-kart track. I'm pretending like I didn't hear her, but... that only works once. What if she says it again? I could try a coughing fit. At some point, I'm gonna have to respond. Well, just because she says it, it doesn't mean you have to. Oh, I'm-I'm not gonna say it back. I still don't like saying the word "girlfriend." Why can't it just be fun? Why does it have to be love? Well, for some people, like Amber, they're the same thing. If that's how she feels, then... I don't know. I'm gonna have to break up with her. Again. - Bowie. - Bex. Hey. - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - I asked you first. - Did you, though? Can we roll the tape? Wouldn't that be great if there was actually a tape, though? Yeah. Your mom asked me to repot this African violet. - And I'm returning my wedding dress. - What? I mean, since I'm not gonna be wearing it. Yeah, yeah. No sense in keeping it then, I guess. I just... I never got to see it. - Do you want to see it? - I thought it was bad luck. Only if we were getting married. Which we're not. It's... Yeah, show me. What's wrong? This was a bad idea. You don't like the dress? No. I... I don't like the dress. I love the dress. And I want to see you in the dress. And I want Andi... to wear the dress when she gets married one day. And now none of this is ever going to happen, because we're not getting married. Do you wish we were? Yes. Why didn't you say something? I thought I made it clear the first time I proposed to you. And when I came back early from our world tour so I could propose to you again. When I said, "Let's not get married," you said, "Okay." And it's clearly not okay. It is. It is okay. Because it's what you want. I want you to be happy. I want you to be happy, too. I am. I am. I just never thought... seeing a wedding dress could actually... hurt. ♪ It's how we heal ♪ ♪ All of the cracks and scars... ♪ I gotta do... this. ♪ And ignored the signs ♪ ♪ Should have known her heart was on the line ♪ ♪ You, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ - "Trashing stereotypes." - "Do you see me now?" Huh. Huh. This is what you've been working so hard on? Yep. What do you think? Well, it's deep. And wide, and high. This isn't the best angle to see it from. It looks better from up here. - Andi. - Wow. - That's... - Stupendous. - Great work, Andi. - Thanks. Trashing stereotypes. Do you see me now? - Whoa. - Whoa. That really is deep. I didn't know you could do this. Ooh, ooh. Can you do me next? - This is gonna change your life, you know. - Temporarily. Admit it. This must feel good. Yeah, it does. It's my 15 minutes of face. Sync corrections by srjanapala Next on Andi Mack... - Where did you learn to do this? - Nowhere. - It's basically a collage. - Just check your email. - What am I looking at? - Shadyside Academy of Visual Arts. SAVA! T's an art school. I think... you should apply. This is Rachel. My girlfriend. Oh, you're real! - I'm sorry, what? - That was unpleasant. - I'm happy for him. - Is that about you? Who is she?
