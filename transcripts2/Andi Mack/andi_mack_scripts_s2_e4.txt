 Previously, on Andi Mack... Hey, Jonah. Hey, Cyrus. Do you see that? Jonah Beck sayin' hi to me? Like, wha'ever. No B.D., we're friends... Okay, look, not everything has to be a competition. But can it be? You made the team? - Yes! - I knew you would. Bex coming back is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

 Don't make her leave again. Again? What did you tell her? Nothing, I swear. I... Uh... I don't want her to think I sent you away. Well, I know that's not what you think. Because that's not what happened. Mom, we've been having this fight for 13 years. I've resigned myself to the fact that we'll never agree what happened. I'm the kid here. You're the adults, it's your job to figure this out. So, tell me the names of the moves. I made up a little song.

 - Why? - 'Cause it's easier if I sing it. ♪ R is right and F is face ♪ ♪ U's up here and D's downtown but flipped around ♪ ♪ And Prime is backwards 'cause you do ♪ ♪ things backwards when you're in your Prime ♪ I didn't say it was a good song. So if I say U2, what do you do? Twist, twist. Very good. - If I say D Prime... - Kah-choo. Nice! Show me Jackhammer! R-U, R Prime, U Prime! Ah, this is all I wanna do today. Just sit here and learn to do this puzzle. Nothing else. Just this. All day? You don't have much confidence in your puzzle skills. Hey, if we got time left over, we can work on my fidget spinning skills. It's from CeCe. She's doing a "closet cleanse"? What's the point? It's just gonna get cluttered in two weeks anyway. She says if we want anything, we'd better come pick it up today, otherwise she's throwing it out. - I'm telling her yes. - No, we're busy! It'll only take an hour. And then... we can cleanse the fridge? get some bread, cold cuts and cheese to go with our mustard? I can't. Not today. Why not? - I need your room. - Why? It has a door. What's going on? I'm sorry. Today's just a very hard day for me. Yeah, I... I got that. Thirteen years ago, when you were a baby... I'll never forgive myself. I'm so sorry, Andi. - Today's the day when... - You left home. You know what today is. Oh, honestly, I don't remember. Mom... don't even. Oh. Shouldn't there be more? What shouldn't I even? I'm sorry, I can't do this. I don't wanna be here. Listen. If I can forgive both of you for lying to me for 13 years, then you should be able to forgive each other for whatever happened 13 years ago. - She has a point. - She always does. We need Pops. Where is he? He's at his Hot Yoga class. Dad's doing Hot Yoga? I did not know that. There's a lot you don't know about us. Well, it's not like opening up and sharing - is your specialty. - Okay! Today's about forgiveness. Remember? From, like, a second ago? Barchu et adonai... Barchu et adonai ham-vo... Jonah! Hey, Cyrus! What can't you do? What's that? Hebrew. I'm studying for my bar mitzvah. You shoulda gotten the save-the-date. I did. I'm savin' it. You can read that? How do you say docious magocious in Hebrew? Mm... You don't. But I appreciate your pretend interest. Dude, don't put yourself down like that. You think this is me putting myself down? You should see me when I'm really putting myself down. Actually, you shouldn't. It's dark. Well, there's something I couldn't do. Read that. I'd much rather be able to do that. You wanna skateboard? I can teach you right now. Ah-ha-ha, good one. Cyrus, it's easy. You can do it. Really? Hold on. Let me turn down my mother's voice screaming "No" in my head. I swear, I'm not selling anything. It's for this class at school. Community service. Our grades depend on how many people we can sign up. Nice to know you care, Buffy. Millie, of course I care. You know I've always been a really great neighbor. No, you haven't. Well, I'm being one now. How would you like a hot meal delivered to your door every day? Healthy food? - Lots of vegetables? - Tons of vegetables. No, thanks. You can sign me up when you find a food service that delivers baby taters and milkshakes. That's my favorite meal, too. I like to dip my baby taters in my milkshake. Me, too! Only two times in your life you're allowed to eat like that... your age and my age. Millie, I really wanna sign you up for something. And not just to get a good grade. Well, what do you got? - Social calls? - What's that? Somebody comes by, oh... takes you for a walk? Like a dog? No. Well, how is it different? Pass. Oh, or we could just sit and talk? Watch TV? Or maybe just play some games. - Card games? - Of course card games. - Right now? - One game. Okay. One game. Ever play Spite and Malice? No. Excellent. My tank top collection! Look at all my tank tops! See how I fringed the bottom of this one? Yeah, it looks like your bra has a hula skirt. You joke, but I was kind of a tank top celebrity. It was how I layered them. And I wore these pants. Skull wallet with chain, natch. And, saving the best for last... dun-dun dahh! I wasn't allowed to get these. I mean, you know what that's like. Only you listened to her. I never did. Never? It wasn't just what she said, it was... how she said it. Like I was stupid, and everything I did was wrong. But I looked cute. Do you wanna see my signature outfit? Absolutely. So what actually happened? It's not coming out, but it's just lipstick, I think it's fine. It's not the end of the world. No, it's just the end of Andi's clothes. She can wear them, she won't care. Live like a farm animal if you want. I won't let you raise Andi that way. Um, she's my daughter. You can't take care of her! You don't know how! Yes, I do! Look, it's not just changing her diaper, Rebecca. What... What if she gets strep throat? An ear infection? What if she puts something in her mouth and starts choking? Do you know what to do? How can I trust her with you? You can't even do her laundry. She was constantly criticizing me, and telling me everything I was doing was wrong. I think you're exaggerating, just a little bit. Aw, Bex. I'm tryin' to clean up, and you're makin' a mess. Thank you, Mom, your timing was perfect. See? What did I tell you? What did you tell her? Nothing. Please don't ruin my relationship with Andi. I loved being her mother. Can't say the same about me, though, can you? Feel free to set the record straight, Mom, tell her what a terrible child I was. Bex wasn't a terrible child. I just get so frustrated when she clings to her skewed memories. That's the main source of our conflict. But... I want you to know what really happened. Hello. Your father and I are having dinner. Would you like to join us? Nah, I'm good. So, have you decided what you wanna do about school? When I do, you'll be last to know. I'm happy to take care of Andi so you can get an education. You're not raising her! I'm just trying to help. You had your chance to raise a daughter and you blew it. She's not your do-over! Rebecca, it doesn't have to be like this. I'll leave a plate for you in the fridge. I'm sure that's very different from what she told you. Very different, you could say that. You could also say completely different. Yeah. - Okay if I come in? - Hey, Pops, how was Hot Yoga? I hate it. It's the worst. I bought a 10-class package. - Uh-huh. - Oh, hey. Do you know what today is? Uh... Bex, get in here! Today is the first time that we've all been together in this house, on this date, in 13 years! Yay! Am I the only one who's happy about this? I am, too! Yay! Yay! Yay? Yay. Needs some work. We'll get there. You catch on quick. Thank you. But not quick enough. Read 'em and weep! Ugh! I was so close that time! - Ohh... - Go again? I gotta win once. Not going to happen. You don't know me. You don't know me. I'm not leaving here until I win. I've lost my friends, I've lost my family, I've lost my teeth. But I have never lost a game! Deal. I'm loving this! I feel so free! This isn't skateboarding. This is standing. You have to move. Do I, though? When I'm blessed with a vivid imagination. You're one of a kind, Cyrus. I'm actually not. I've met my doppelganger. Heh... How's my form? Your form's great, but your skateboarding leaves something to be desired, but that's okay. I was hoping we'd be able to go skateboarding together. You and me...? Whoa! You and me? Skateboard buddies? I want that. That's great! Now just kick it back a few times. Cyrus, you're doin' it! I'm doin' it! Cyrus, slow down! I don't know how! Turn! I don't know how! - Stop! - I don't know how! Ahh! Cyrus! My arm! I need an ambulance. You two don't need to keep fighting about whatever happened back then. I turned out okay. Thanks to me. We all heard that. One thing I still don't understand. I get why you left. But why that day? Did something happen? You didn't tell her? Tell me what? You wanna tell her? It's not my favorite story. - She should know. - Know what? From now on, when Andi has a check-up, I'm taking her. Not you, just me! Ugh! You're overreacting! The pediatrician doesn't even know I'm her mother! Of course he does! He gave me a lollipop! For being brave when Andi was getting her shots, which you weren't, by the way. Knock, knock. What is it, Ham? We're in the middle of something. I think you left something in the hallway by the coat rack? She was still strapped in the car seat. - Oh! - Well, I thought I had her... - You had her last... - You were supposed - to take her from me... - No, I... I didn't... How long was she there? Since we got back from the doctor. - That was 40 minutes ago. - Ohh... I'll take her. Mama. Did you hear that? Did she just say her first word? Mama! She said Mama! Say it again. Mama. Mama. Mama. - Mama. - Aww... Andi, I'm sorry. Do you forgive us? I'm so sorry... Bex... It's fine. I just need a minute... I made you leave. It was me. I can't believe the first words I ever said were the reason why you left. It wasn't only that word, it was all the other words that had come before it. Hey... I didn't wanna leave. It was the last thing I wanted. But the first thing I wanted was for you to be happy. And I don't think you would've been... with the both of us here. I trusted you, because I knew how much you loved her. That was an amazing sacrifice you made. What? I don't think I could've made it. Mom... you've never said that before. Read 'em and weep! Ugh! Do you have to say that every time? Yes, I do! At least until you actually start weeping. My deal. This isn't the only thing in your life... is it? You really lost all your family and friends? Yes, I did. None of them will play with me anymore. Wait... They're still alive? - So what, if they won't play cards? - Ugh! My friend Cyrus is in the hospital. Um, I gotta go. But you didn't win. You said you wouldn't leave until you did! Thank you so much, Millie. For what? For reminding me that friends are more important than winning. Who said that? I didn't. Next time bring baby taters. And milkshakes! And make mine chocolate! Oh, how is he? - I don't know. - What happened? I was teaching him to skateboard. - What? - Are you insane? You were with him when he threw up on the merry-go-round. Sometimes I forget how helpless he is. You do? It's his defining characteristic. Oh, here he comes. Guys? Check it out. I'm in a sling! Did you break your arm? Part of it! You had me so scared, dude. I'm so glad nothing happened to you. Nothing? This is a milestone. My whole life I have lived under a cloud of fear. "Don't climb to the top." "Don't swim after you've eaten." "You could get lost and die in a corn maze." But today, I was reckless. I stood on the edge and looked into the abyss. And here's the proof. And I want you all to sign it. Smaller. Just your first name. Leave some room. Hey, Mom. I'm done. Oh. What did you decide to keep? Not much. A few tank tops. And these... because they're outstanding. And the rest of it? It just... It feels like it belongs to a different person. Anyway, I don't have the room. I gotta start saving Andi's stuff, so she can throw it out when she grows up. I have a confession. You knew what today was. Why did you deny it? That's what I do. It's a reflex. So when you invited us over... It's like this place was haunted for one day every year. And I thought if you were here, it would break the spell. I think it did. Me too. And this whole "come get your stuff" routine was a ruse, I knew it. I knew you'd never throw it away. Oh, no, no, no, that was real. We gotta get this place in shape. We're selling it. Selling what? The house. You're selling the house? You can't do that, why would you do that? It's just too big for your dad and me. But... it's our house! You don't live here anymore. What about AndiShack? What happens to AndiShack? We gotta clean that up, too. Mom! Andi's gonna be devastated! I agree. That's why you should be prepared when you tell her. Me? Why do I have to tell her? Because you do all the big jobs now. You're the mama. Uh... ♪ R is right and F is face ♪ ♪ U's up here and D's downtown, flipped around ♪ ♪ And Prime is backwards 'cause you do things backwards ♪ ♪ When you're in your prime ♪ It's catchy. Long day, huh? Too long. All I wanna do right now is make a tent out of my blanket and eat animal crackers. Oh, before that, there's something I have to tell you. What? We also have vanilla wafers. Ooh! Yay! Have fun. I'll just be here singing to my cube.
