 Previously on The Lying Game... She was asking a lot of questions about her mother this summer, right? I told her what I always tell her. The woman is dead. What are we gonna tell her when she finds out that isn't true? You didn't steal anything? You brought me love; just returning the favor. We can't do this. You should go.

 When did this happen? Since the first moment I saw her. When Sutton gets back, Ethan, what happens? You're Sutton's boyfriend. I know. We're gonna get a read on that water tower behind your mom and Emma. Oh, my God, this is amazing. That's my room. My crib was right on that wall. I can't believe I'm standing in the place where our mother lived. We used to fall asleep, staring at those stars.

 Wait, there's something there. Our mother's name was Annie Hobbs. Everything looks great, Phyllis. I have to say, we've really outdone ourselves this year. The kids are going to be blown away. It gets bigger every year. Back in the day, ours were just as big. Back in the day... I keep telling Char to enjoy these things, these events. They all happen so quickly. Wish I could get my Char to run. Certainly has the time now. ♪ ♪ Somebody's been practicing. Oh, don't stop my account. So, they really go all out for Homecoming here, huh? - Was it like this at your old school? - I wouldn't know. You had to be asked. Come on. Like guys weren't hitting on you all the time. Unless you count my pervy foster brother, Travis, no. My friend Lexi and I would just go to the movies. I'm guessing... you're not going. Good guess. Yeah, you're right, these high school dances, they're just so lame. You kind of looked like you were having a real good time a second ago. That? Yeah. Yeah, no, I was just, I was just... I don't really know what that was. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay, fine, I admit it, I do want to go to this thing, but... it doesn't matter what I want. What would Sutton want? Is she anti-Homecoming, too? You are going to make a beautiful Homecoming Queen. I am? I know talking about it jinxes it, but you'd better get some posters up-- I've seen Nisha's everywhere. And what about those catchy slogans you and Char came up with? Oh... we... have to work out some of the kinks. What is this? The school has asked for photos from past years' dances. You look beautiful. Thank you. Your dad and Alec, they were big men on campus. - Oh-ho... - Kind of cheesy. Yeah, that hair. Oh. There's you. Two days old. Hmm. So sweet. Guess how many Annie Hobbs there are in the world. 523 in the continental U.S. alone. How did you find these? Uh... you don't want to know how easy it is to steal Social Security numbers off the Internet. You did this when I was in the shower? No. Last night. I couldn't sleep, so it was either that or watch the Hoarders marathon. So what's next? We need to cross-reference with DMV records state by state, see if we can get a picture off a driver's license. Okay. Well, Emma was in foster care in Nevada, so let's start there. Okay. How long is this rain gonna last? Day or two. The roof leaks, but... it's kind of cozy, right? I guess. ♪ Lying Game 1x05 ♪ Over Exposed Original Air Date on September 12, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ Uh ♪ ♪ Uh, uh-uh ♪ ♪ Uh, uh-uh, uh ♪ ♪ Watch out for this girl ♪ ♪ She's got a gun for a tongue. ♪ But I told Justin I would go with him before I got grounded. Doesn't that mean I'm grandfathered in or something? You're not going to the dance, period. He's running for Homecoming King-- he needs my support. What he needs is a miracle. - He's new at school, right? - Yes. And don't you always say we should root for the underdog? You can root from home. Mom, you know how important Homecoming is. I think your father's right. You stole your sister's laptop. You tried to blame an innocent kid. You can't expect us to pretend like it didn't happen. So unfair! So? Parole denied. Oh! I was hoping... What, you were worried I was going to miss your acceptance speech? Right. Acceptance speech. Hey, Laurel. You've done so much for me and Ethan, you know, the whole laptop confession... I... can't go without you. It wouldn't be fair. - You'll get over it. - No, I won't. I won't. So I'm not gonna go. I'm gonna skip the dance. Sister solidarity. Right? And... we'll stay here, we'll do makeovers, eat junk food... And what about the grand plan? Sutton Mercer wins Queen junior year, wins again senior year. By the way, you pull that off, and you'll get your own shelf in the trophy case. Right now you're more important. Seriously, if you hadn't come forward like you did, Ethan would be in jail. Well, I suppose you do owe me. Exactly. So girls' night, it is. What are you doing here? I missed you at rehearsal last night. I tweaked a hamstring in gym class, so... I thought I'd give it a rest. So you're okay, then? I mean, after what happened. I kissed you; I shouldn't have done that. Look, Mads, I think you are an amazing dancer, and... I don't want things to be awkward between us. Not with the recital coming up. I came over to see if there was a... a problem. You could have told me all that over the phone. Mads, I'm home. You stay in here. Why? We weren't doing anything. You know my dad-- if he finds me with you, he'll freak. Hey, Dad. Hey, honey. Hey. I thought you didn't get back until tomorrow. Uh, the conference wrapped up early, and I took an early flight home. - Oh. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. - You feel a little warm. Might be coming down with something. - Yeah, there's a lot of stuff going around. - Yeah, yeah, I hear. - You good enough to go to school? - Uh, yeah. All right, go get ready. I got some calls to make. Hello? Dr. Hughes, it's Alec Rybak. Did you check Annie Hobbs day log? Yes, and she hasn't had any visitors since the last time you were here. You're absolutely certain? Our security's airtight. For what I'm paying, it'd better be. This visitor you're concerned about, will it be a man or a woman? It's a girl. Teenager. She calls herself Sutton Mercer. Now, I'm guessing she's looking for a payday. She's gonna be making a lot of crazy claims. I can send you a picture, if that'd be helpful. Got it. Sutton Mercer. Thank you, Doctor. Keep an eye out Mads? Your sister's pulling out. Why should I? For the exact same reason. Well, because... because, because I should totally be dating the Homecoming King. Oh. The truth finally comes out. Let me put it another way. This is the social equivalent to... winning the Masters. But instead of getting a green jacket, you go from transfer student to Arroyo's hottest bachelor. Mm. But... I'm taken. Taken? God, that does have a wonderful ring to it. Look, you do realize the guys from the team put me on the ballot as a joke, right? General pop doesn't know that. All they know is that you're new and cute and interesting. Now... what you need is a good campaign manager... and luckily, my services are available. First order of business... visibility. Vote Justin for Homecoming King. Vote for him. Hey, I can't believe you're dropping out of the race. Nisha's got virtually no competition, and if she wins, I can't even imagine. Okay, well, if it means that much to her, maybe we should just... Let her win. Are you kidding? We'd be creating a monster. I'm doing it for Laurel, okay? She's so bummed that she's missing the dance. Hey, guys. I'm gonna hit the plaza after school. Shop for a Homecoming dress-- who wants to join? very regal, very Kate Middleton. Sutton's not running. Right. So, like I was saying, something totally royal, with just a hint of the unexpected. Char, no, really, I'm sitting this one out. I don't get it. We've been planning your campaign since eighth grade. I'm the Pippa to your Kate, remember? I've got four campaign posters in the works. My mom saw them and said, why don't I run? Well, why don't you run? Sutton, I told you a million times, I'm a behind-the-scenes girl. Ladies, looking lovely. Save it, Nisha, we're not voting for you. Like I even need your votes now that it's basically a one-woman race. Was up for the competition, Sutton, but I'm sure you have your reasons for not running. And I assume you're bringing your new boy toy to the dance, or is that still on the DL? Actually, I'm going solo. But why don't you ask Eduardo? Went so well last time. Please, the dude is cute but hardly my type. - Mm-hmm. Um... you're dating Eduardo? For, like, six months. I guess I wasn't the only one in the dark on this one. I just said I was to save face with Nisha. Because she likes him, too. And you know how she gets when there's a trophy on the line. No matches in Nevada or Utah. Moving on to Idaho. I was thinking, what if Annie Hobbs is hiding from us, from me? - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Have a little faith in the ones and zeros. Okay, we are going to track her down. What if she just doesn't want to be found? Emma was right-- I should just go back to Phoenix. I have wasted enough of your time. You should really be working on your app. Look, at least we have a decent chance of finding Annie. Okay? As for me creating the next Angry Birds, look at me. I'm living in a leaky apartment, taking handouts from my sister. Not exactly feeling like the next Steve Jobs. Are you kidding? You are going to be a huge success. - Sutton. - No, seriously, really. You are super smart, and you are the most dedicated guy I know. Honestly, if it weren't for you, I would have given up on this search so long ago. You have been amazing. I mean that, really. Thayer, uh... Uh, I should go find that circuit breaker. I'm starting to think that my dropping out of the race is a big mistake. No, you're doing the right thing. But no one seems to buy that Sutton would give up the chance to be queen. Because she wouldn't. So you're saying I should run? Personally, I never understood why she was so into it in the first place. Maybe I should just ask her what to do. Every day I am here, it's like I am losing a little piece of myself. You're not. You're still Emma, and you're never going to be Sutton. Gee, thanks for the encouragement. I wasn't saying it as a bad thing. Nice. Really, you think so? Definitely. Where'd you learn to draw like this? Just kind of always been able to do it. You're lucky. Only thing I was born with was my dad's right hook. Oh... Oh, that's it. What, what's it? What if I got this from my mother? No, Sutton found that mural in my bedroom of the night sky. Those stars weren't stenciled, They were painted by my mother. She even signed it. What if Annie Hobbs was an artist? Okay, that's all for today. Thank you, girls. Hey, about this morning... We can't talk here. Mr. Rybak, what a nice surprise. Hi, Nisha, I didn't know you took ballet. I don't; just dropping off a check for a few private lessons I took with Eduardo. You must be so proud of Mads, having the lead in the recital. Yeah. Between you and me, I never believed the rumors about her and Eduardo. What rumors? Oh. Whoops. Nisha. A rumor-- probably nothing to it, nothing at all. I mean, that's why they call them rumors, right? Right. What did she want? Nothing. No, she was just talking about some crazy rumors about you and Eduardo. She is so... I've already told you, there is nothing going on between me and Eduardo. He's an amazing choreographer and he's a perfect gentleman. Honey, it's my experience, there is no such thing as a perfect gentleman. Hey, you want something to eat? No, I'll get something later. Come on, sit down, I made some steaks. So listen, uh... about the laptop, I'm sorry, you were right, I should have trusted you on that. Can't say it surprises me that Laurel Mercer was behind it. Those sisters are nothing but trouble. You don't know anything about 'em. I know that I was almost suspended last year without pay because of one of Sutton's little lying games. She's different now. She cares more about people, about her family... about me. Is she still keeping you a secret from her friends? So what if she is? I know that the last thing you want to hear is my opinion. But I've been there. If someone's trying to hide the fact that they're with you, it's not a real relationship, man. Girls like Sutton Mercer-- you can park their cars, but you just can't date 'em. Come on, Sutton, where are you? Hey, sport. Hi. What are you doing? I was picking out pictures of your Homecoming to send over to the school. They're doing some sort of display or something. Who talked me into a pink tie? Oh, wait, oh, that was me. Nice. Live, you learn. Hmm. I love this picture. Hmm. Who... took it again? I don't remember what you had told me. The guy from the adoption agency. Oh, right, right, the baby broker. Baby broker? Honey, we used an adoption agency. Okay. Hey, did the adoption agency ever tell you what my birth mother did for a living? Honey, we've been over this. I know, just-- I don't know, she could be anything. She could have been, um, a doctor or a waitress, artist. You'd better get that. Hello? Easy there, tiger, it's just us. Check it out. Isn't it fantastic? Char got the guy at the copy shop to do the layout for free. Had to show a little leg, but it was totally worth it. Guys. I know you want to stay home with Laurel, but Nisha crossed a line, saying something to my dad. If that's the only reason-- because of Nisha-- I think maybe it's time to just try and make peace. Again? Please. You have to do it, Sutton, for us, for me. I've already started on the acceptance speech. See, we've done all the leg work. Now all you have to do is just radiate. - Good morning, sweetheart. - Morning. So I wanted to talk to you guys about something. It's about Laurel. I was kind of hoping you would reconsider letting her go to Homecoming. Did your sister put you up to this? No, no. She has no idea I'm out here. I just don't understand. She stole your things, blamed your boyfriend. I know, and I was really mad, and she told me why she did it, and it... Look, I know in the past, I haven't been a great sister to her, but I just want the chance to fix it. Please, for me? For us? Everyone take one, pass them around. Vote for Sutton. You've obviously got the jocks and cheerleaders on your side, but we need to build your base. Now, today's sche-- vote Sutton. Whatever you say, Char. Who's that? Couple classes together, definitely fringe. Another group we need to work on. So your schedule for today: 12:00-- lunch with the yearbook staff, 2:00 p.m.-- hand out cupcakes to the marching band. Cupcakes, really? Um, Nisha's got a big lead. If we want to beat her, we have to dig deep. Don't be late to the lunch. Okay. So much for sister solidarity. Sutton Mercer, back in the race. Laurel... Just when I thought there was actual hope for us. Laurel, stop. You can go to the dance. What? Since when? Since I worked my magic with Mom and Dad. I mean, technically, you're still grounded, but they said they'd spring you for the night. Now... go tell your candidate the good news. - Hi. - Hey. Um, I can go to the dance. To-to the dance? Mm-hmm. All right. What's with the text? So, I guess this means you're running. Got to say, I'm surprised Sutton's cool with it. I keep trying to reach her, but I can't get through. You know, this campaign has taken on a life of its own. Char has me booked back-to-back, schmoozing voters and, you know, to be honest, I'm not really a people person, not like Sutton. Just be yourself. I can't be me and her at the same time. I'm playing this part, and it has its perks. But... okay, listen, I know that you're not into high school functions, but it's gonna be a really crazy night, and it would be really great if I had my boy... my one real friend there. Sutton has made it pretty clear she doesn't want people to see us together. I'm her secret boyfriend, remember? Well, we don't have to go... together, together. I mean, we can... You can stay on the other side of the room if you wanted to. I... Just knowing that you're there and close-- I think it would help me pull it off. Please? I can't. I can't. Close your eyes. Okay, open. I thought it might come in handy while you're getting ready for the dance. You can try it with different hairstyles, see which one looks best, and you've always had such beautiful hair. I-I think... I think you should wear it down. - Mom? - Or up. Up is fantastic. I know you're really happy that I'm running for queen. What if I lose? I just... I don't want to let you down. It's not possible. I got to go get dinner ready. Okay. Hey. Oh, I am so glad you called. So, I have this theory that Annie Hobbs was an artist, and I figured it out when... Excuse me. Is that my my mom's tiara? Homecoming is coming up. And, what, you're running? I've been trying to tell you, but I just couldn't reach you. Well, the power's been down. I wanted to pull out of the race, but people were starting to get suspicious. It's really honestly the only reason why I am doing this, because I have to. Well, you can say no, okay? I tried. You don't understand what it's been like... I know what it's been like. Just don't try and pretend like... like... you don't really want this. I've never thought that I would be able to run for something like this and actually have a shot. And to have parents and a family-- it's truly a gift. More like a hand-me-down... from me. Look, I know that this is your life... Yes, it is. And just remember, it's not you they care about. Sutton... Have fun at the dance. I'm working my butt off here in L.A., and Emma is-is totally out of control. She's messing up my plan. She is stealing my life, one yearbook page at a time. She's really trying. Of course. No, you're right. I-I'm... I'm sorry. I... I'm just... I'm really missing you. I would give anything to be on the back of your bike, wrapping my arms around you. And what about Homecoming? We'd meet up after, go for a ride. Or I could come with you. Please. You wouldn't be caught dead at a high school dance. Maybe I'd be willing to make an exception. Well, I'm stuck in L.A. So, don't have to worry about that. But if you were here... You still don't want anyone to know about us? I thought we felt the same way about this. You were never planning on taking us public. I mean, that's the reality here. - Ethan... - No. Stop, all right? Forget it. It's all real clear. Thanks. No matter who you voted for, Sutton says it's just important that you voted. X goes to Sutton Mercer. What does that get me? A cupcake... but not much else. See you, Derek. Hey! Hi. Hey, great game! Oh, my God, thank God you're here. Hi. We thought the queen might be late for her own coronation. I feel like I'm on display. In this game, that's a good thing. According to the latest exit polls, I'm up by 40 votes. Oh, well, did you stuff the ballot box yourself, or did you have your friends do it for you? Game's over, Sutton. The only thing you're going repeat is remedial French... in summer school. I can't wait to see her face when Sutton wins. - It's going to be epic. - Mm-hmm. Mads, what's your dad doing here? Chaperone. He lives for this stuff. Gets to work the floor, relive his glory days. Hit on the single moms. What? It's true. He knows my mom's still married to my dad, right? I was tidying up Sutton's room, and found something... strange. Did you know she could draw, like this? I had no idea. Some of these are pretty good. Maybe we should encourage her, see if she wants to take a class at the college, or... Yeah. It's a good idea. I was thinking... Do you think one of her biological parents could have been an artist, and maybe if we contacted the adoption agency and just asked...? So they can tell us what they told us 17 years ago-- Sutton's mother was a troubled young woman, she didn't even know who got her pregnant? Maybe. I'm... I'm just starting to think we made a mistake, telling her she died. I mean, if I was adopted, I'd be curious about my birth mother. I'd probably want to meet her. - It's only natural. - The woman had severe emotional problems and a history of drug abuse. For all we know, she probably is dead. Okay, and even if she's not, call me overprotective, but I don't want to see Sutton get hurt. I suppose you're right. ♪ ♪ Sutton? Hey. If this is about Mads, I kind of just want to stay out of it. No. I just wanted to wish you luck tonight. Oh. Thank you. You've had your eye on this tiara since you were, what, five? It's got to be incredible, you know, being so close to getting everything you wanted. I guess. You always were that girl who'd stop at nothing, take no prisoners. I have to check my makeup. Hey, Sutton? Have fun tonight. And if you win, keep your ego in check. You don't want to forget who you really are. All right, attention, everyone! Everyone, may I have your attention, please? Here we go. Now... - Where were you? - Uh, outside. ...time that we've all been waiting for. The moment of truth. It's time to announce Arroyo High School's 2011 Homecoming Court. Well, well. Everyone, please join me in congratulating the new Homecoming Queen, a star on the tennis court in her own right. and a champion The winner is Miss Sutton Mercer. We did it! What are you waiting for? Go on. Go greet yo people. Oh, wait! Your speech. Fellow classmates, esteemed teachers... Uh... You don't know how much this means to me. I especially want to thank my two best friends-- Char Chamberlin and Mads Rybak-- for believing in me. I have always dreamed of something like this, and just never thought it was possible, so... here I am... I guess. You don't realize you want something until you let yourself want it, so... Thank you. Well said. Congratulations, Sutton. And... the new Homecoming King is... indeed, a newcomer-- Mr. Justin Miller. Oh, my... oh, my God, you actually won! This is just insane! Go! And just be handsome. Got to say, I admire you for keeping a brave face. And I am surprised to see you out and about after certain recent revelations. I thought the D.A. would have you on lockdown. Well, whatever you said to my dad, he didn't buy it for one second. Could've fooled me. Thank you. And now it's time for our King and Queen's first dance. Justin, Sutton. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ This is surreal. You have no idea. ♪ ♪ You mind if I cut in? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ What are you doing? i Thought nobody was supposed to see us together. I don't care who knows. What about Sutton? This isn't about Sutton. I came here for you. I never would've pegged you for the tuxedo type. Me, neither. It turns out I was just waiting for the right girl to ask me. Hey, where did you go? We have some celebrating to do. Everything okay? Yeah. It's just... Nothing. No, no, wait, wait, what is it? It's just... last year I'm Laurel Mercer, like, A.P. Dork, and now I have this amazing boyfriend, and... thanks to my newly awesome sister, I get to see his... coronation. It's nice when things work out. And you deserve... all of it. Then why do I feel like it's all going to end somehow? Well, if it makes it any better, amazing boyfriend isn't going anywhere. You're the best thing that's happened to me since I got here. I'm not gonna let you go. Derek. Got another job for you. Oh, man. I thought we were done. You're gonna like this one. Yo, so what's the job? I can't believe Sutton is slumming it with Ethan Whitehorse. Did you have any idea she was even seeing him? No. And after I confided in her about Eduardo. Eventually. Hey, why aren't you guys dancing? Not really feeling it. I'm gonna go get us something to drink. I'll see you in a minute. Okay, this isn't really happening, right? Okay, Char, I... know that you're not crazy about Ethan, but... he's a really great guy. To sneak around with, maybe, but to actually date? How long has this been going on? Almost... a year now. And you never thought to tell your best friends? What is with all the secrets around here? Maddy. Can I talk to you for a second? Yeah? What is this? I thought you said there wasn't anything between you and Eduardo. I... told you, there's nothing going on, Dad. That was... we were in the middle of rehearsing a scene for the recital... Maddy, I've got a pretty good ear for lies; you want to try again? All right, it wasn't a rehearsal. I kind of threw myself at him. But he didn't want anything to do with me, so... Was he there when I got home the other morning? Was he in the house? Yes, but it's not what you're thinking. He... Wait, Dad, where are you going? Don't ask questions you already know the answer to. You keep doing that, you'll break it. - Where are you going? - Out. What if you stayed? Why should I? Whoa, hold on, hold on. Are you sure about this? Okay. Never mind, forget I said that. Mr. Rybak. You expecting someone else? Listen... I never laid a hand on Mads. I know, I know. You're not stupid. Actually, that's not why I'm here. I don't understand. Let me get it. - Maddy, why don't you go home. - No, Dad. I've got this. ♪ ♪ Hey. Hi. I got your text. What's going on? Um... our birth mother, Annie Hobbs, she's from Scottsdale. I think this is her... with Ted and Alec. Martin. Do not let this girl anywhere near Ms. Hobbs. - Understood? - Got it. And make sure the rest of the staff knows as well. Mm-hmm. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
