 Previously on The Lying Game... Someone broke into your house. My house? Yeah, and they stole the laptop. Absolutely everything is on that. So, I found your laptop inside Ethan's Jeep. He's the one who stole it. That's crazy! I'm so sorry. I'm-I'm all over the place. I like the Emma version. I do feel like I can trust you.

 - Welcome to Arroyo. - Thrilled to be here. This really is my number. I'll see ya. Our birth mother wanted Emma back so badly that she faked her identity to come get her. Do you want me to drive you back to your motel now? Could I stay at your place? That's you, Emma, and our mother. Young lady, you've got some explaining to do. Alec? We worked like hell for three years to get that new state-of-the-art facility at Arroyo, and this is where you choose to run? All right. So... where you headed?

 I got turned around. Really? This is the same route I used to drive you and Mads to Little Tykes Gymnastics twice a week all through elementary school. Things look different at night. Come on. I'll give you a ride home. ♪ Lying Game 1x04 ♪ Twinsense and Sensibility Original Air Date on September 5, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ I'm telling you, Ted, she was shaking. That girl was terrified. I think I know my own daughter. You're describing a totally different kid. I know she was asking a lot of questions about her mother this summer, right? Her birth mother, okay? And I told her what I always tell her: the woman's dead. What are we gonna tell her when she finds out that isn't true? Look, I'm just following the script, okay? You're the one who wrote it. Yeah, to protect you, right? You're the one who screwed up. I have not forgotten. Look, we both have a lot to lose. Yes. Okay? And I can't afford to lose any more. So you keep an eye on your kid. The last thing we need is her snooping around L.A. Yeah, well, last time I checked, she's still here in Phoenix. Can't be in two places at once, right? You don't think that it's freaky that Alec just happens to pull up behind me? Honestly, no. Maybe I'm just still weirded out about the whole laptop thing. I mean, if it was planted in Ethan's car, then that means somebody is out to get him, but who and why? Okay, Emma, the clock is ticking, and sooner or later someone is bound to figure out that I'm not there. And to be honest, I'm starting to miss my life. Do you know the last time I went this long without talking to Char or Mads? Never. They're pretty amazing. I mean, they just seem it to me. They're your friends. Right. And eventually I'm going to need to take my life back. I know. So we need to work really fast to find our birth mother. And that photograph is our only clue. Does it trigger any memories? No, nothing. I mean, I can't remember stuff that happened last month much less a random day when I was three. Really? I can remember in detail almost anything from my childhood. Well, you lived a life worth remembering. Okay, I know this is hard, but I'm not the one in that picture, you are. And you're the one with the memories and you are the one that can lead us to our mother. Now, at the arraignment, the first thing your attorney's gonna do is enter a "not guilty" plea. You just better hope the judge doesn't look at all your priors and try you as an adult. Whoever planted the laptop is trying to break up Sutton and me. The only ones who knew about us were you, her parents and Laurel... and whoever stole it. Sounds like an ironclad defense to me. Ever think about going to law school? Yeah, just be sure and tuck your shirt all the way in to hide the chili stain. You must love your job. Just look the judge in the eye, don't give him any more reasons not to believe you. Sutton Mercer keeps a journal? Or are you updating your enemies list? Hello, to you, too, Nisha. Anything about me in there? No, sorry. It's before I knew you. Before you knew...? You mean, when you were three? Oh, I see, so we're just revising history, huh? That's how we're playing it? So we were never friends? Oh, okay, cool. Whatever. I'm fine with it. Nice and over, reach. Very nice. Lovely. Are you interested in the ballet class? Me? Uh, no. In fact, ballet's, like, the last thing in the world I'd want to do. Good, 'cause it requires talent... and grace. My tennis coach is riding me about my footwork. Said I have to take some classes if I want to keep the number one singles spot, so this is basically detention in a leotard. Ooh, does he teach? Eduardo? Oh, no, he's a guest choreographer. He doesn't give private lessons. It's okay, Mom. Okay. How do you feel about teaching gifted athletes? Got a minute? Yeah. Why does that sound so ominous? It's just we haven't had a chance to really talk about things since the dinner with Ethan and... We... need to know that you're not seeing him. But what if he's innocent? I mean, what if I know that he didn't do it? If I know that he couldn't have broken in? Hey, this isn't just about the laptop, okay? I'm just not crazy about this kid. He's got a juvie rap sheet a mile long. So he's made some mistakes. Are you telling me that when you were younger you didn't make mistakes? Look... I'm gonna get that. Okay. Seriously, have you always been perfect? There's nothing that you did that you wish you could undo? Well, yeah, you know, actually, I did sport a mullet briefly freshman year. What what I thinking, right? This is making you uncomfortable. Honey, okay, look, you have to trust me on this. I only want what's best for you. Okay. Okay. Okay. There he is. You must be Justin. - Pleasure to meet you, Dr. Mercer. - Yeah. I'll go get Laurel. Thank you. So, Laurel tells me you're quite a golfer. I wouldn't say that. I mean, I like getting out there and walking the course, but I did make the school team, though. Pretty stoked about that. I'd love to get you out there for a round at the club if you wouldn't mind hacking around with an old duffer. - Sure. That'd be awesome. - All right. Hi. - Hey. - Hey. Who's this beautiful girl? We haven't even had our first date yet, and you're already hitting on him? He's a golfer. Honey, find out his handicap. You look amazing. - Thanks. - Ready? Mm-hmm. Okay. You know, Metallica, they did an amazing cover of this song. Wow. Yeah, good job, good job. There you go. Thanks. Whoa, that's good. Thank you. I've had a great time tonight. Me, too. I'm just glad you finally took the hint and asked me out. What hint was that exactly? Um, giving my phone number out to random girls? Okay, that might have been a mistake. Yeah. You're telling me. You know what also might have been a mistake? Uh, tipping that guy $50 instead of a five. No! Uh. Yeah, no wonder he wanted to keep playing. This is, uh, this is embarrassing. I'm a little short. So cute. You're blushing. That's okay. I like being out with a big tipper. Thank you. Mm-hmm. One hint, please? No. I'm hating this. First, Sutton bolts from my party for some cryptic reason then you bail to chase after your mystery guy. The last time I felt this left out, I was wearing that headgear in middle school. Oh... metal mouth. So not funny. Seriously, what's happening to us? We used to tell each other everything and now it's secrets, secrets... Oh, my God. Justin and Laurel. Hmm. Hey, guys. We were just leaving. Oh, and we just got here. Crazy, huh? So when did this happen? I would say since the first moment I saw her. Oh. - See ya. - Bye. Sutton? Honey? Sutton. Oh, you're having a bad dream. Sutton! It's okay. It's okay, I'm right here. It was so real. It's just a dream. Do you want to tell me about it? The dream? Breathe. I was... I was trapped... and I thought I was dying, like, I couldn't breathe, and I was drowning. Oh, God. It's the first time in ages. What? Well, you had that nightmare all the time. No, I know, I did. I... Wait, what? Well, don't tell me you've forgotten? When I... was a kid? You're still shaking. I'll tell you what, why don't I rub your back until you fall back asleep? That's what always used to work. I mean, unless you don't want me to. Then... No, I... I would really love that. Okay. Okay. You're safe. I'm always here. And you can't draw a breath? Totally. It's like I'm drowning and I try to scream... - Yes, yes, but nothing comes out. - And nothing comes out. - Whoa, this is... this is weird. - You know, I read about this. It's a psychic connection between identical twins. They even call it twinsense. I always thought it was a little, like, woo-woo New Age-y, but obviously it's real. Maybe something traumatic happened to you and our mother and that's what the recurring nightmare's about. I don't know, that sounds kind of crazy. No, think about it. Whatever horrible thing I'm dreaming, I never actually experienced, but... It really happened to me. Maybe you can access the memory of that trauma and that will lead us to our birth mother. It's impossible. I am alone here. I have nobody to talk to, and... Should I ask your parents? No, forget it. They'll just tell you more lies. Okay, there's... one person that you can talk to-- Ethan. I don't want to... I don't want to cause a problem. Then don't. I mean, I'm used to losing guys to you or Mads, but getting screwed over by a sophomore? Not cool. Okay, don't be mad, and I'm really sorry, but I'm kind of the one that set them up. What? They already met, and they were so into each other. I'm sorry, you're taking your sister's side over your friend's? Mads, can you remind her how wrong this is, because my head is about to explode. I mean, sometimes you can't just decide who you're going to be with. Sometimes it's destiny. And look, we can always find you another guy. It's not about the guy. It's about us. We used to have each other's back, and now it's like we're drifting. I'm hating this. Wow, Sutton screwing over a friend. Who would ever see that coming? You don't know what you're talking about, Nisha. My palms are actually sweating. I hope Sutton's friends are going to be okay with, you know, us. Well, they will have plenty of time to get used to it. Oh, that was so the right thing to say. I am going to get us something to drink. Waiting for anyone I might know? Number one on the parental disapproval list-- name begins with "E"? Look, I know Mom and Dad want me to break it off, but I just... I really need to see him. Well, you're not going to find him here. Have you not heard? Ethan's been suspended. For stealing your laptop. He even lost his job at the club. Sutton, your boy's in some deep doo-doo. Thanks. Ethan. Oh, my God, are you... are you okay? How are you doing? Uh, suspended, fired, arraigned. Same old, same old. No, seriously, I'm worried about you. Why won't you tell me? Figured you were pretty busy with that picture. So how's that going, anyway? Uh, so far, nada. Actually, I was hoping that you could help me dredge up some memories or interpret some dreams. Oh, yeah, sure. You know what, I'll bring along some peyote and my favorite dream catcher, and then we can go off and do a harvest dance and duck into my sweat lodge. Not because of your heritage. No, because you're the only friend that I have. We have-- Sutton and me. All right. How about tonight, the overlook? We can meet up there around 9:00. We could try to put it off, but then it might have to be behind bulletproof glass. What are you talking about? Guess they were tired of seeing me in juvie. They set my trial for next week. As an adult. Mark Twain was right-- a good walk spoiled. Yeah, says the man who won every skin. Just caught some luck, really. Yeah, in your DNA. Here you go. It was fun getting out there, playing with you guys. I'm not taking your money. I insist. I'm a man of my word. So is Ted Mercer, isn't that right? You earned it, Justin. Take it. Well, Laurel's, uh, up there. I should probably get going. - Good round. - Thanks. Never seen you so worked up about your lousy putting game, man. Make one mistake, you have to pay for it the rest of your life. One mistake. I think you might be right about Sutton. I think she knows something. You keep on her. It's not important what she thinks she knows. What's important is she never finds her mother. No, no. This is ballet. It should be light, graceful. First position. Let's try the battement tendus again. Knock, knock. Hey. Brought you a smoothie. Mango-papaya-- your favorite. Mads, you're the best. Hey, while I have you, can you demonstrate a proper tendus? Love to. Thank you. Obviously, I don't expect you to be as good as Mads, but next time, I'd like to see some improvement. I'll see you next week. Hey, maybe you could find a boy at school to practice with. Dance doesn't really come to life until you have a partner. I want to talk to you about Ethan. Honey, we've discussed this. And this is hardly the time or the place... It's okay, let her finish, Ted. Look, he was with me when our house was broken into, and he had no motive to want the laptop. So I think that there's something else going on here. - Like what? - A conspiracy? Sutton, you're my goddaughter, and the last thing I want is to see you unhappy. I know you care for this boy, but... Then why won't you help him? Because a life lesson here is more important. Worse case-- he goes to jail, he does a little time. He thinks about his mistakes, he comes out a more productive citizen, like his brother. And what if he's innocent? Innocent? If he's innocent, then who broke into your house, stole your property and planted it to make him look guilty? That just... doesn't make any sense. If he's not guilty, then who's the guilty party? I am. It was me. I staged the break-in and I stole the laptop. It was all me. I guess I was sick of watching her get all the attention while I played this supporting role in the Sutton story. And this was your mature way of expressing some sort of sibling jealousy? Frame an innocent kid? He's her boyfriend, and I couldn't stand to see her happy. Poor Ethan. I've already talked to Alec. All of the charges have been dropped. He's going to be back at school tomorrow, and he's getting his old job back. And what about his reputation? You can't just undo this, you know? I know. I just wish I could turn back the clock. Well, I'll tell you what you can do-- you can forget about any dances, parties, dates. You're grounded, young lady. It's what I deserve. Are you okay? And the Oscar goes to... Laurel Mercer for The Sutton Story. Tell me that turning-back- the-clock stuff wasn't inspired. You didn't steal anything. Duh. I really am the perfect child. But hey, you brought me love. Just returning the favor. Come here. Seriously? We're gonna hug it out? Okay, but hurry, because with all this tenderness, I really am about to vomit. Wait a minute. How are you gonna see Justin now? Uh, how long have you been in this family? In a week, Mom and Dad will feel guilty and back off. Maybe this was a cry for help. And until then, how grounded am I really when my big sister has that window door thingy that does tend to remain unlocked. You... are... evil. I learned from the master. Oh, this is good. This is very good. Hmm? Check it out. Pixels are filling in and the resolution is super clear. We're gonna get a read on that water tower behind your mom and Emma. And, my friend, we have a location. "Fillmore, California." You up for a road trip? Oh, my God, this is amazing. I know. Ethan, uh, I thought we said later. Oh, good, you're here. Come on in. I'll just be a sec. Uh, come in. Okay. Ethan, you have no idea how awful we feel about what you've had to go through. I'm so, so sorry. Thank you, Mrs. Mercer. Hello. Laurel, don't you have something to say to this young man? I'm really sorry about what I did. I know it's no excuse, but I didn't think it was going to spin so out of control. I mean, if I could turn back the clock... Oh, hey, it's all right. No worries. It's very gracious of you, Ethan. So sorry again. Laurel. Well, do you... I probably want to get back to my brother. Yeah, I'm gonna walk Ethan out. Okay. This was nice of you, Dr. Mercer. It's my wife's idea, son. Have a nice night. Okay. All day long I've been dreaming about this. Wait. We can't do this. But the other night, that kiss... I know. I've had time to think about it, and, Mads, you're 17. Who cares about our age difference? Uh, the State of Arizona, for starters. Are you making fun of me? I'm not, Mads. I think you're an amazing person. And I won't lie, that kiss... it took my breath away. But I can't. Stop fighting it. There's no point. Maybe if we met at another... No! I'm sorry. You should go. Hey, you. So, I was cleaning out my closet and found... this. You must have left it at our last movie night. Which was, like, two years ago. We had a lot of great times here, but I guess it's been a while, huh? Yeah, I don't know. Whatever. Could you toss me that towel? Swimming solo. That's a first. Aren't you supposed to be with your friends? They have plans. Hmm. Look, I like you, Char, always have, but eventually you're gonna get hurt because once Sutton decides she's over you, she's over you. I don't think Sutton hates you as much as you think she does. Well, I don't know. Look, I know you have this whole conspiracy theory about us, but Mads and I never set out to replace you as Sutton's best friend. You know what? I'm over it. Well, don't act all blameless. You've done plenty of stuff to us. Mads included. Like, lying, backstabbing, acting all sneaky. Oh, I'm sneaky? I'm not the one who's having an affair with my ballet teacher. I'm sure she already told you. You guys are all best buds. You do realize you were cleared of all charges? I mean, that's a good thing, isn't it? Whoever stole the laptop, tried to frame me and stop Sutton is still out there. You know, it's not such a good thing. Okay, I don't mean to sound like Sutton here, but I think we should just put the laptop stuff aside and concentrate on this. - You're right. - Okay. How's it going, anyway? I'd say progress is glacial, except glaciers actually do move eventually. Okay, all right, let's... let's try to focus on the nightmare. Like, close your eyes. All I remember is... not being able to breathe, like I was drowning. Okay, let's do something else. All right, here, then try a good memory. You know, just something small. Anything, like a nice time, whatever. Okay, this is hopeless. You know what I'm thinking about? Kristin comforting me the other night after my nightmare. Yeah, that's not gonna help. I know that. It's just that she's been so good to me and I feel more of a bond with her than I do with this stranger. I'm sorry. This person means nothing to me. I... I wasn't drowning. The reason I couldn't breath was... I was trapped in a fire. Well, we've learned one more clue about your birth mother. She had a terrible Realtor. I mean, come on. You're in California. There's Santa Cruz, Palm Springs, Big Sur, and she picks Fillmore? Is this helping? Sorry. Just trying to lighten the mood. I hate to see you so down after all your hard work. I think we're missing something. Like what? The feed store's long gone, nobody knows the woman in the photo. It's not like we have a name that we could track. We're at a dead end. Hmm, maybe Emma will have better luck. - I was in a fire. - What? Are you okay? No, no, when I was little with our birth mother. That's what the nightmare was about. That's why I couldn't breath. It wasn't drowning. It was smoke. I was trapped in a burning house. That's what you need to be looking for. There you are. Here, got you this. Two-percent, one sugar, extra foam. Keep it. Probably bought it for someone else. Whoa. Why are you acting this way? What's going on with you and Eduardo? Okay, do we have to do this here? Oh, my God, it's true. You're having sex with him. And of course, old Char's the last one to know. It's the eighth-grade Grand Canyon trip all over again. Okay, calm down. She seems calm to me-- she's just waiting for an answer. Are you sleeping with Eduardo? Yes. Yes, I am. We've been together for, like, six months how, and we can't keep our hands off each other. How about you, Nisha? You seeing anyone? Any cute freshmen on the boys' tennis team? Wow, nice flow, good color scheme. What? Look, I'm just trying to be positive, okay? Mm-hmm. Honestly, I think it's a tear-down. I say we offer way below the asking price. You think this is really the place? Well, the neighbors said the fire was about 14 years ago. So time-wise, it makes sense, but only Emma will know for sure. Oh, when she calls, just remember... Not let Emma see me. I know, I know. Have no fear. I shall remain your dirty little secret. Shut up. Oh. Hi, I'm here. Or at least I think I am. Uh, you have to tell me, though. Here. You getting any of this, Emma? I don't know. It's really vague. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. There. In the doorway. There was a swing. I... I remember a swing. Incredible. And... there were stars. There were... beautiful stars. Stars... stars... Whoa. I know that room. That's my room. I... My crib was right on that wall. Okay, I can't believe I'm standing in the place where our mother... lived and-and possibly died. But I don't... There should be stars. I don't see stars. Oh. Oh, my God. What? What? What is it? I remember I used to fall asleep staring at those stars. Wait, there's something there. It's... it's signed. Annie Hobbs. Our mother's name was Annie Hobbs. I can't believe you remember all this. But why can't I remember the important things? Like did my mom make it out alive? Or... did she sacrifice her life for mine? Hey, easy. You don't know any of that. But I have a right to. It's my life story, and my past... and Sutton's. And... nobody should keep that from us. Uh, you're losing me. Okay. Let's say you adopt a baby and the birth mother has twins. You mean you wouldn't know that? Or at least be curious enough to find out? I guess every adoption is different, probably. No. This isn't a story in Dickens. This is L.A. in the mid-90s. Okay, all right, well, what are you saying? I'm saying, I... I get this weird feeling from Ted. Like he knows. About me, or... the fire, and what happened to Annie Hobbs. But why would he keep that all a secret? How fun was that? And why haven't we done this in, like, forever? I know. I... you're, you were good out there. Oh, thank you. I was just trying to get the ball back. But your backhand, wow! We know you didn't get that from me. Oh. I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. It's okay. Hmm. Actually, I... I wanted to ask you about her. My birth mother. I know she died, but... do you know how it happened? Or when? I mean, could she have... drowned, or... been in a fire? Oh, honey. This... this is about your bad dream. I... I don't know. I honestly... I have no idea. Oh. Okay. Can I tell you something I've never admitted to anyone, not even your dad? Yeah. I wish I could've met her. Really? Yes. Then I could've had the chance to thank her for the greatest gift I've ever had. You. Ethan. Um... Sutton's not home yet, so... you can just make yourself comfy until she... Allow me. Hey, where are you? We've got company. Laurel. Hey. Uh, I was just calling to tell Ethan I-I'm running late. It's fine. You know what? I'll just... I'll come back later. I'll just call back. No, that's fine, No, don't be silly. Stay. Sit. Later, sis. Might want to keep this closed. All right. Okay. I cannot do this anymore. You have to come home. Soon, I promise. But the search is heating up. I... don't think we should quit. I'm not talking about quitting, I just... I think we need to look here. I think your dad is hiding something, but... with your mom, we may have an opening. If she wanted to help, she would've done it already. I have a name, Emma, and I want to track it down. Look. You knew her. Okay? She held you and played with you, and sang to you. I never had that. I want to find our mother. I need to find her. What am I going to do? I can't keep hurting these people. You... you just have to hope they're going to understand all this. And that they'll forgive you. They're not going to forgive me. They'll forgive Sutton. But... I'm... I'm nobody to them. They... I'm just this fraud, and this imposter, and they'll just kick me out. In a heartbeat. And who could blame them? What's going to happen to me? When Sutton gets back, Ethan, what happens? I... I don't know. You're Sutton's boyfriend. I know. Hey, hon. How was gal's tennis? You know? Great. Oh, that's nice to hear. That's really nice to hear. Anything... interesting come up? I wasn't going to say anything. I didn't want to upset you. What do you mean? We're a team, hon. I think it's wrapped up in that dream, but... she seems to think her birth mom might have died in a fire. Huh. Well, I'm sure it will pass. Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot. A patient called for you. Sutton took the message. Mmm. Never give out the home number. Never give out the home number. Never give out the home number, huh? You know what? I gotta swing by the office to get this guy's test results. Laurel didn't steal that laptop, no way. Highest honors Laurel? Doesn't make any sense. And that whole confession was rehearsed. Didn't feel right. What are you, a detective now? Lay off the Law & Order reruns, stick to rhinoplasty, Ted. You think this is funny? I think you need to calm down. This whole thing could come crashing down at any minute. Which is why you need to keep it together, okay? For the both of us. Okay? Ted, you know how this works. Yeah. If there's dirty work to be done, you just leave it to me. Just like in high school. All right. Okay. Then, I think you got some work to do. Annie. Annie Hobbs. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
