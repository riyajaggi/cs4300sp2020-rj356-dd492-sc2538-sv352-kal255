 Previously on The Lying Game... My twin sister. Wait a minute. Let me get this straight. You-You want me to take your place? Two days. Just hang out, relax. I'm gonna find our real parents. I knew it. You're not Sutton. Probably you that gave him the idea to go there. You told him, didn't you? Is that right? Answer me! Hey. Hold it. Someone broke into your house.

 My house? Yeah, your room, and the only thing that they stole is the laptop. Everything is on that. The trail that's led me back to here. You guys need to find that thing! Why didn't you tell them about me? How I'm helping you in this. His name's Ethan Whitehorse. It's like he's her secret boyfriend or something. Sutton? He's just a friend. So why didn't he use the front door? As promised, Sutton Mercer's laptop. You get everything you need from that?

 It's none of your business. You know what to do with it, right? Can't I just toss it in a pond or something? I want this thing as far away from me as possible. No, you can't just toss it in a pond or something. You have to do what we talked about. Yeah, but those charges you said you'd get dropped? Your office keeps calling, so it's kind of like... Just do what I ask you to do. Then we'll see. Morning, sexy. Sutton... Good guess. Palm trees give it away? Emma doesn't call me sexy. Yet. Look, I know I owe you an apology. For not telling me you were leaving? Or that Emma was taking your place? It all happened so fast, and I figured it would be safer if no one knew. Plus, I knew I was gonna be back in a few days. Hey, Dan. You plan on going to school today? Why wouldn't I? I don't know. You might want to get your ass out of bed. How's it going on the break-in at the Mercer house? Is there any word on the stolen laptop? Why do you care? Unless you're seeing Sutton again. I told you, man, you just got out of juvie, and that Sutton girl... I know. Sutton's bad news. You assaulted the D.A. last night because of her. I'm not gonna be able to save your ass every time. All right, he's gone. Dan knows about us? Uh, hello, secret boyfriend. Who else knows? Actually, your mom and dad. They walked in on me and Emma last night. What the hell is she doing? I go away for a few days, and this is what happens? - This is what you told her to do. - No, no. I told her to pretend to be me. I thought she would keep her head down, but instead, she's messing up my whole life! Oh, I think she's doing just fine. All right, it took her a day to break up with Luke. How long you been saying you were going to do that? That's not the point. Just make sure nobody else finds out about us, and stay away from Emma. How'd you figure it out? How'd you know it wasn't me? I kissed her. It was the only way I could know for sure. All right, if you had told me about the switch, I wouldn't have had to kiss her. You kissed Emma. Well, I would appreciate it if you didn't do that again. You're my boyfriend, remember? I love you, Ethan. I love you, too, Sutton. ♪ Lying Game 1x03 ♪ Double Dibs Original Air Date on August 29, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ Uh, uh-uh, uh ♪ ♪ Uh-uh, uh, uh ♪ ♪ Watch out for this girl ♪ ♪ She's got a gun for a tongue. ♪ Okay, yes, he's my boyfriend. - But what about Luke? - I don't know. I think I kept seeing him for you guys, really. While you were sneaking around with... Ethan. Yes. Why don't we have him over for dinner? The guy who clocked your godfather? Alec's actually the one who hit him. I just want you to understand that he's not some creep who snuck into my bedroom. He's... Look, I promise-- if you get to know him, you're going to see how great he is, like I do. That was amazing. Thanks. But you're gate-crashing. I thought I was alone. I'll buy a ticket. How much do I owe you? Uh, depends. The Get Up Kids played this park last spring, and that was free. Sounds like a great night. I saw them at Coachella. Slept in my car to pay for the three-day pass. I would do it again in a heartbeat. So what are you doing out here wasting music on the birds and bees? For now, you know. But one day I'll have this place packed. Get Up Kids packed. And I will be looking forward to it. I'm Justin. Laurel. First girl I met in Phoenix. Lucky me. See you around. Kind of heroic that creepy, weird guy got in my dad's face for you. Speak of the devil. Hello, girls. Mind if I steal my daughter for a second? Alec, I just want to apologize for butting in last night. Things got kind of out of control. Oh, listen, apology accepted. Will you excuse us for a minute? Like it was Sutton's fault. You embarrassed me in front of all my friends. Kind of like you're doing right now. Mads, I could have handled last night a little better. But that's no excuse. You cannot just not come home. You need to call, okay? We still have ground rules. What, like the rules you had with Thayer? I'm trying to be the best father I can. I love my children, Mads. We're all we have left. Uh, can you give me a sec? Ew. No, really? I should at least say thank you. Alec was strong-arming me, till Ethan came along. Well, don't let him breathe on you. And watch the spittle. STPs-- so serious. We're learning all about them in Bio. Thank you for the head's up. Mm-hmm. What are you doing? Allegedly thanking you for defending me from Alec. Actually, letting you know the good news. I sorted things out with the parents. Told them that you were my boyfriend. Well, Sutton's. What?! Why would you do that? It's a good thing, isn't it? The Alcove, five minutes. You and Emma are twins. It'd be weird if he wasn't attracted to her, Sutton. 'Cause our relationship is purely physical? Oh, come on. If you weren't worried, then why did you tell him you love him? What kind of person do you think I am? A smart one. With a trunkful of ulterior motives. What Ethan and I had is beyond physical. He's very romantic. Even the way we met. Okay, forget it. No, no, no, please, regale me with instances of his awesomeness. Thayer, just tell me what you got. Okay, your birth mother... Ruth Peterson-- this I know. Name on both our birth certificates. Bailed on me in Santa Monica. She just shut down her profile page. Now that's how we contacted her before, so my guess is Ruth stood you up for a reason. Why? What would make her change her mind? Maybe she just freaked at the thought of meeting her daughter. You can be kind of overwhelming. Luckily, I'm a genius. Her friends list was cached on the search engine, so I was able to cross-reference. Seven of her friends work at the same place. I'm betting Ruth works there, too. Where is it? Rodeo Drive? Movie studio? Even better. A library. What do you mean you told them I was your boyfriend? They walked in on you at 11:00 at night in my bedroom. Yeah, and we told them that we're just friends! Which is lame. They weren't buying it. So I had to just tell them the truth. The truth? The truth is, they're not your parents. You're someone else pretending to be their daughter. Which, P.S., they believe. So obviously I'm doing a pretty good job. Why are you pissed at me? This is a good thing for you and Sutton. They want to get to know you, they want to have you over for dinner. Dinner? Yes. Kristin-- she is a great cook. Okay, fine. I'm really sorry. I got carried away. I just thought that Sutton would want them to know-- at least if you guys got caught-- that you weren't some criminal. Well, that's not what Sutton wants, okay? What about what you want? Just get Laurel to keep quiet about this stuff, okay? Sutton's friends can't know about us. And you got to make this dinner go away. It's what Sutton would do, and this is her life you're messing with. So he's not your secret boyfriend? No. I... Ethan freaked when Mom and Dad found out. He doesn't want anyone else to know. So you have to keep it on the D.L. Oh. I guess I could, but how will I remember not to tell anyone? You want something. Uh, duh. That's how this relationship works. You do something bad, I find out about it and then blackmail you in exchange for my complete and utter silence. Oh, well, what do you want? There's a guy. I met him this morning in Cactus Park. All I know is his name's Justin, he's new in Phoenix and judging from his T-shirt, he might be in the Marines. In Phoenix? Or he was in the Marines. Or he loves the Marines. Okay, yeah, this isn't a lot to go on. Okay, tall, blonde, surfer-cute, kind of... Runner-preppy? Hi, new guy. Hey. Welcome to Arroyo. Thank you. Thrilled to be here. A week late-- missed so much already. Don't worry, we'll fill you in. We kind of run the place. Then I guess you're the girls to know. And I guess you are a fast learner. Here's hoping. Nice to meet you. Likewise. Okay, so I know we both saw him at the same time, but he's perfect for me, don't you think? So Ken to my Barbie. At first glance, sure. What, you want him for yourself? No, trust me. I just... Come on. I just got kicked out of dance recital, my mom is back to drinking herself into a stupor. I need something fun to focus on. Okay, the "new guy" it is. Right? Must find out everything! Everything. Did you see the super-hot new guy? Sure did. Let everyone know he is so mine. There she is. Are you Ruth Peterson? How did you find me? Oh, my God... I can see it. Our eyes are kind of the same, right? You know, we can't talk here. Why don't I get my purse and, um, we'll take a walk? Yeah, okay. Great. We'll take a walk. This is incredible. No, something's not right. She's bolting. Please stop, Ruth! Mom! I can't give you what you want. I don't want anything. I just had to see you and just know the truth about you. And I want you to know that your twins, we're okay, and we found each other... No, don't. I... I'm sorry. The real truth is, I am not your mother. I'm not anyone's mother. If you're not my mother, then why was your name on my birth certificate? Because I was paid a lot of money to put it there. By whom? A baby broker. He told me your real birth mother was in bad shape, wanted to keep her identity a secret. Said I'd be doing her a big favor. And I'm not proud of it, but... at the time, I really needed the money. I mean... do you at least know my real mother's name? No, I-I never met her. I don't know the broker's name either. He paid me in cash. It was all so... secretive. All that mattered to me was that the babies each ended up in a happier place. Well, not so happy. My sister Emma ended up in foster care. No, no, you were both adopted. I signed those papers. You went to the Mercers in Phoenix, and the other twin went to the Websters in Beverly Hills. Okay, this doesn't make sense. If Emma was adopted by a rich family in Beverly Hills, then how did she end up in the foster system in Nevada? It's too late. Char already called dibs. What are we, 12? Dibs is the code, and you invented it. When I was 12, right? Okay, so now it's perfectly fine for me to go after the guy your best friend likes? I don't know. I mean, well, you saw him first, right? I understand you want to be a good friend, but maybe if you just talk to Char. 'Cause we're BFF's. I haven't gotten my official invitation to the wolf pack, and if I go after her new crush, I probably never will. I've seen what you guys do to kids you don't like. Char would have no problem making my life miserable, and you'd probably help her do it. Laurel, I would never. You're my sister. Okay. Very reassuring. You know what? Forget it. Hey, stranger. Hi, Justin. Welcome to Arroyo. Um, lucky us, right? I mean, twice in one day. Yeah, it's just a teeny tiny little world. I gotta get to Chem. Before you do... How did you learn how to do that? Dad was in the mob. I'm kidding. But this... really is my number... in case there are any, uh, private concerts I should know about. I'll see ya. Mom? I need to talk to you. Okay, me first. I feel awful. You feel awful? I thought I was the one who got caught with a boy in her room. Yes, and that is not okay, but... What? I can't believe you felt the need to sneak around and hide your true boyfriend, keep seeing Luke just to make us happy? It's not how I want your relationship with me or your dad to be. I want to be honest with you, more than you know. Please don't think just because Luke is familiar we wouldn't be open to someone from somewhat different circumstances. Thank you. That means a lot. So, thank you for suggesting dinner. I think it's a great idea. We're looking forward to meeting Ethan properly. Actually, I was going to suggest that we cancel dinner. I have this paper due for Mr. Beattie... You mean Mr. Beastly, the teacher you've been dreading for years? Not that I'm complaining, but since when do you care about a paper being due? Well, I-I don't. It's just... I think you're looking for an excuse, and I don't want you to find one. I want to have this dinner. And I'm making tamales, your favorite. Well, I guess dinner it is then. I'll tell Ethan. I thought you were gonna take care of this. I couldn't. Sutton could have. Well, I'm not Sutton! Keeping you a secret, seeing Luke, Kristin thinks that this is their fault, and I have no idea if that's true. It is breaking my heart, and it'll break her heart if you don't come. You really care about these people who aren't even your real parents? They're the closest thing that I have ever had. I know I have been making a mess, but I'm just trying to make it better. Well, I guess I should help. Really? Yeah. Thank you. Sorry. That's all right. I will see you tonight. 5...6...7...8 Do you want to get going? Un-um. No. Hey, there. By any chance could I get you to wait in the car? What, for these prices? Don't you think I should have a front-row seat and a bucket of popcorn? Sometimes the girls get a little nervous when they're not ready. I just want it to be perfect for when the parents see it at the recital. Is that what it is? I'll be right back. Hello. Well, tell the judge the D.A.'s office doesn't agree. Thank you. Do you want to talk about it? No. I just want to dance. My parents are liars. They said our real birth mother was dead. Maybe she is. They said Ruth Peterson was dead. She may not be our real birth mother, but she's certainly alive. Okay, but what about that baby broker? They could have told your parents anything. And if our adoption was as shady as Ruth made it sound... Yeah, shady and illegal. Fake names on fake birth certificates? It's crazy, Emma. I can't believe Ted and Kristin knew about that. Why not? You've been drinking the Mercer family Kool-Aid? It's just... I mean, they've been really nice. Maybe they think they're protecting you. Emma, it is the most natural thing in the world for an adopted kid to want to find her real birth parents. Why are they standing in the way of that? It's got to be something big. Okay, it's just... what they did then doesn't matter as much as who they are now. Maybe not to you, but it matters a whole hell of a lot to me. I hope you like tamales. I don't know if you're a vegetarian or... No, no, this is great. I eat anything. So, Ethan, I gotta ask, how was prison? Laurel... No, it's-it's okay. Actually, it was juvie, and it wasn't fun. Why don't we start with something a little more basic, honey? We know your brother, we know you work at the club. Is that how you and Sutton met? Yeah. No. Well, you valet at the club. And we go to school together, so... Why don't you tell the story? Well, yeah, we had seen each other at school and at the club before. Probably more like I'd seen her, but then there was that flat tire. Oh, right, right! Yeah, I'd seen her on the side of the road. So I helped her change it. And that was it. So nice. Honey, you know we have Triple A. Thank you for coming to Sutton's rescue. 'Cause she just screams "damsel in distress." I don't buy it. There's no way you'd let some strange guy-- sorry, but a guy everyone in this town talks about-- pull up and take over. You're right. I actually insisted on changing my own tire, right? Well, I was trying to spare your parents the part where you almost destroyed a $200 rim because you were too stubborn to admit you had no idea what you were doing. It's all starting to fit together now. After that, we took a little ride on my motorcycle. Whoa. What? I wore a helmet. Right? Yeah. Yeah, I want to take her up to the overlook off Route 18. There was this rising moon that night. It was pretty incredible. I remember this. You came home one night, raving about the moon. Saying how it had always been there, but you'd never seen it. I'll get it. Moon love's a little mushy for me, anyway. So what do you ride? I had a Vespa when I was an intern back in L.A... Sorry to interrupt, Dr. Mercer, Mrs. Mercer. But I need to get my brother home right away. It's a family emergency. Everything all right? I'll explain when we get home. Um... Thanks so much for dinner. It was great. Sorry I have to bail. Yeah. Thanks for coming. Nice to meet you. He's lovely, honey. Yeah. Lovely? Motorcycles and moonlight? That's a dad's worst nightmare. I'm sorry, I just... have to... This couldn't wait till later? I'm protecting them. Didn't want you doing any more damage. What's going on? Do you need my help? Go back inside, Sutton. I don't want to do this in front of you. Do what? Tell me! Okay. So I found your laptop. Inside Ethan's Jeep. He's the one who stole it. That's crazy. And impossible, because Ethan was with me the night of the break-in. Well, maybe he didn't break into your home. But someone did. And your laptop ended up with him. Or how about someone planted it on me? But you didn't give it back to her, did you? I didn't know it was there. I didn't do this. Well, don't worry. We'll get to the bottom of it. Ethan won't be bothering you anymore. Let's go. Don't feel bad, kiddo. Some people are just really good at deceiving you, and that kid's got charm for days. So you think he did it? I think until the cops tell us otherwise, that's what we have to assume. I just thought... that he was the one person I could trust. Honey... what about us? You can always trust your mom and dad. Okay? Hey, look... forget Ethan. All right? Everything else has been going great since we got back from Paris. Whatever you're doing, you just... keep doing it. I think I can do that. That's why I love you. I love you, too. Good night. Night. What are you writing? So intense. - Is that your journal? - English paper. What? I didn't have time last night. You're actually trying to finish and turn it in? Yeah, or she's just madly copying whatever she found on the Internet. No, it's a paper for Mr. Beattie's class... Whatever you have is way more important. Uh, yeah. We have to figure out the perfect "Get Justin" plan. I'm thinking pool party. Lure him to the house, go in for the kill. Plus, boy-hunting in a bikini means I'm already halfway there. Char, what do you know about this guy? I mean... you really think he's all that? You've seen him, right? Yeah, he's super hot... Oh, great. Now you want him. You know, I thought it would take you more than a second to get over Luke. Can I have nothing for myself? No, I-- you absolutely can. All right? And I know you called dibs. Forget it. There's a sale on at Bloomie's, which usually feels just as good as having a boyfriend. Not that I would know, but... I'll see you later. It's okay. She's just a little raw. Clearly. I just don't want to see her get sucked in, and then... get her heart broken... I don't know. Guys can be... You think they're everything, and then they turn out to be... nothing. Except when they're everything, right? ♪ ♪ Nice digs. Emma would've liked growing up here. Hi. Are you... Randall Webster? And, uh, who wants to know? I think you adopted my twin sister. Well, this is the great tragedy of my life. We did adopt a baby, brought her home, everything was perfect. Till the birth mother showed up, asking for her child back. You can do that? I hired the best adoption attorney in L.A., but the birth mother had all the right paperwork. We had no choice but to hand our baby over. So that's... my mother you're talking about. What was her name? Who knows? She said her name was Ruth Peterson. Even had a driver's license proving that it was. Ruth Peterson. We just met her. She says she's not... And she isn't. See, all we wanted to do was follow up, make sure the baby was okay. Quickly found out what you did: Ruth Peterson was just paid for her name. So the real birth mother, the one who came to your door, got a fake driver's license and then... Disappeared. With our baby. Didn't you call the police? We couldn't. Truth is, I knew this was a back-channel adoption. Did my parents know this adoption was back-channel? They must have. Honey? Where are you? I just got home. I'm going to have to go. I don't want this to upset my wife. Can I give you my number, address, in case you think of anything else? Absolutely. Good luck. Thank you. So did you hear? Cops finally caught the guy who broke into the house, stole Sutton's laptop. No, I didn't hear. Yeah, it's that valet you got into it with the night of the father-daughter dance. Ethan Whitehorse. Uh-huh. Kid's got a record, been to juvie... Well, it looks like he's going back. Yeah, well, I know you helped his brother back in the day... That was different. I mean, this is Sutton we're talking about, Ted. We've got to do whatever it takes to protect our families. Shh... don't. You can trust me. You want me to trust you, don't hide in my room and scare the hell out of me when I walk in. I've been fending off guys like you my whole life. What do you want? To talk. To figure out a plan. I think the plan is, wait for Sutton to get back, and let her deal with all of this. Don't you get it? Something's going on here. This isn't just in L.A., it's right here in Phoenix. Yeah, I'm pretending to be somebody that I'm not, and I'm making a big old mess while I'm at it. All this stuff is connected: Sutton's search for her real mother, the break-in, Dan finding the laptop in my truck. I don't know why you would want to steal Sutton's laptop. I wouldn't. Sutton said it herself, all the info about her search is on that thing. Maybe somebody found out, and they wanted to see how far she'd gotten, and then they wanted her to stop trusting me. No one knows that you and Sutton are dating. My brother does. Okay, he knows, and he hates it. He hates you. He's probably thrilled to have an excuse to break us up. Sutton. Break you and Sutton up. You know what I mean. Actually, I don't. And I really don't know you. Some people are just really good at deceiving you. I guess I don't really know you, either. You should come to Char's party. Jeff's gonna be there. To see Char. Maybe not. He gave his number to you. Guys like that give their numbers to lots of girls. What about Trip Pierce? Might be good for you, Mads. Oh, thanks, but... I have my sights set elsewhere. Ooh. Exciting. Do tell! Sorry. For now, that's just need-to-know, and this one is all about you, Char. Ugh, I so do not care if any of these other people come. It's a lot of mini taquitos just to get close to one guy. So why not just skip all that, suck it up, and ask Justin out? - You mean make the first move? - Why not? It's the easiest way to find out if he's interested. And if he isn't, if he wants someone else, then you know, you can just move on. You're crazy! And I'm not that brave. But even if I was, I can't ask him out in person. I don't have his number, and for some reason, I can't find him on Facebook. Ugh. Fine. Here. Laurel, no. Laurel. Oh! It's Justin's number. How did you get this? Don't worry. I got it for you. report immediately Sutton Mercer, please. Sutton Mercer... to Mr. Beattie's room. Mom? What's going on? Apparently, there's a problem with your essay. It wasn't good? No, it was excellent. And that's a problem? Well, it is if I check with your teachers from last year and the year before, and they both tell me you're not capable of this kind of work. Why don't you just tell us who really wrote the paper? 'Cause Sutton Mercer did not. Whoa. Okay. So, what are you saying, that she cheated? No, I worked really hard on that paper. I promise. Is this the only proof you have? The fact that Sutton's essay is so good? Then I'd say you have nothing. Her last two teachers said... I don't care what her last ten teachers said. She's my daughter. And if she says she wrote it, I believe her. Let's go. I can't believe you believe me. I do. With every reason not to, I mean, no questions asked? I love you, honey. When you love someone, you have to trust them. I can't believe you don't believe me. It doesn't matter what I believe. I'm a cop that found stolen property inside your Jeep. Yeah, what were you doing in there anyway? Right. Because that's what this is really about. That laptop is evidence that I needed to turn in. I have laws that I need to follow. So do you. I have been. Even if I do believe you, what do you want me to do? I want you to help me. I want you to figure out who stole that laptop. Why it was planted on me. You have any ideas? Anything to go on? No? Well, then, I'm sorry, I can't help you. ♪ ♪ New guy! You made it. Yeah. Well, I got your text, so, uh... Great! So now you have my number. Feel free to use it. Whenever. Thanks. Nice pool. Thanks. Feel free to use that, too. In fact, feel free to use pretty much anything you see here. I'm going to get a drink. Do you want anything? Not from the bar I don't. Hey. You're Laurel's sister, right? And you are a fast learner. She here? No. Oh, but she's coming, right? Probably not. You see, Char has already called dibs on you. I'm sorry, Char did what? It's the code, and I invented it. And it keeps us from stealing each other's boyfriends. Which is good, except... Except I'm not Char's boyfriend. But she wants you to be, and as per the code, that is enough for Laurel to keep her paws off you. So who I want to be pawed by doesn't matter? It's decided for me? Pretty much. But that way, it keeps the sisterhood intact and good friends are just as important as family, right? Sure. I mean, I-I don't want to mess with the sisterhood. But I do want to date your sister. I know I just met her, but... Have you ever had that feeling that you just want to be with someone and you don't know why? Yeah, I've had that feeling. Do you have a pen? ♪ ♪ That is the new code. Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I'm going to be staying the night at Char's. I'm glad you called. But that's a lot of nights out this week, don't you think? Yes, I know, I know. It's just she's really depressed about getting kicked out of the recital. And so I wanted to stay and keep her company. You're sure that's all this is? Yes, Dad, I'm sure. Okay. Say hi to Char. All right, Daddy, I will. You okay? Did you forget something? Yeah, actually I did. ♪ ♪ I can't believe my perfect parents were involved with something so screwed up. Look, maybe Emma can look at it from her end-- do some investigating. Maybe the real answer's around Phoenix, not L.A. Maybe. Meanwhile, our birth mother wanted Emma back so badly that she faked her identity to come get her. I mean, why not me? You know, why didn't she want me back? I don't know, but something clearly went wrong. I mean, they didn't just walk off into the sunset. Why else would Emma have ended up in foster care? I came here to L.A. to meet my mother and to get answers to questions that I have wondered about for so long. And... all I got was this big, scary mess. Do you want me to drive you back to your motel now? Actually... Can I stay at your place? ♪ ♪ I'm so sorry. I'm-I'm all over the place. I am doing this insane thing in this strange place. and I-I start to think that it actually is making sense, and-and like, I actually belong and I... It's okay. And then Sutton's dad, he's telling me that I shouldn't trust you, but then I have Sutton's mom telling me that you should trust the people that you love, and... Not that I love you, or that they're even really my parents. I just... I don't know what to do... Emma, stop, stop. It's okay. All right? I know I'm a crazy person. Crazy-- but not Sutton crazy. She'd never come to me like this. She's far too cool. I like the Emma version. If nothing else, it's totally honest. That's hard to come by around here. I don't know why... I do feel like I can trust you. I feel that, too. We can't do this. I love Sutton. I know. She's got dibs. I know I locked this door. Something's wrong. Well, at least your laptop's still here. It's warm. So... you didn't go to Char's party. I'm tired of trying to get in with Sutton's friends. Like I'm trying to be Sutton or something. Honey, you two are so different. And you are... amazing in so many ways. Then how come it's so easy for her? I mean, good guy Luke, bad boy Ethan-- they all just flock to her. Which isn't necessarily a good thing. Sooner or later, the right guy's going to come along. And when he does, you won't be able to keep him away. I'll get it. Sweetie, can you come here a sec? Sorry for showing up so late without calling. I just, uh, had to see you. How did you know where I live? Your sister gave me the address. Hope that was okay. Um, no, yeah. It's... It's great. I'm not a crazy stalker, I promise, it's just, uh... I just didn't want to wait till tomorrow to, uh, ask you out. Oh. Okay. Do you think we could go and see a movie sometime? Or a band? Or just sit at the park and talk, while you play some of that music for me that you don't like anyone else to hear? Yeah, I think we could do that. Cool. It'll be fun. I should go. Sleep well. Thanks. I will. ♪ It's the way you smile ♪ ♪ It's the way you smile away your sorrows ♪ ♪ It's the way you laugh ♪ ♪ It's the way you laugh about tomorrow ♪ ♪ And I thank you for the truth ♪ ♪ And I'm here to tell you ♪ ♪ That if your world should fall apart ♪ ♪ I will remind you ♪ ♪ I think you're perfect as you are ♪ ♪ I will remind you ♪ ♪ And if you feel like nothing is going right ♪ ♪ I will remind you... ♪ Well, everything's still here, but whoever broke in saw it all. No one knows I'm in L.A. Are you sure this isn't about you? Your video game apps? It's so competitive. You hear all the time about gamer espionage. No, Sutton, that's... that's not what this is. Okay, then you're freaking me out. I can't believe there was another break-in about another laptop. Sorry. No, no, no, no. That's-That's okay. I'll just, um... uh, sleep on the couch. No, come on. That's... This doesn't have to be weird. I mean, we've known each other since, like, forever. Yeah, yeah, uh, forever. Mr. Webster. Hi... Here, I wasn't sure I even still had this. But, uh, there you go. What is it? That woman-- uh, the one who took our baby-- she sent us that about a year after, and it meant a lot to us. Uh, but I know it's going to mean a lot more to you, and you should have it. She's your mother. Sutton. Hi. So glad it's you. Look. So much has happened. This is a lot harder than you thought. I keep screwing it up. Stop. This doesn't matter. No. It does. Trust me. Answers on the laptop. Trust me. This is way more important. What? What did you find? This. That's you Emma. And that is our mother. == sync, corrected by elderman ==
