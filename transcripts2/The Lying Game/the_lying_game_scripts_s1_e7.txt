 Previously on The Lying Game... My God. What it looks like. Thayer! It's not... I'm sorry for everything. Does that mean you're sorry we slept together, too? The guy broke up with you, Sutton! Sutton is staying with Thayer in L.A., and I think they're sleeping together. How long have you known about that? - Just a couple of days. - A couple of days? Why are you freaking out about this? Justin is a squatter. Laurel, if this gets out, I'm finished.

 - I know it's a lot to ask... - Justin, I'm-I'm not gonna tell anybody. Dr. Hughes, it's Alec Rybak. Did you check Annie Hobbs' day log? She calls herself Sutton Mercer. I can send you a picture. Eduardo was in a crash. I know you tried to pay him off or something! This never would've happened if it wasn't for you. Mom. This is ridiculous and not to mention illegal. I have rights. I came to find my birth mother, and you've held me here overnight, against my will! My name is Sutton Mercer. Got it? I am from Phoenix, Arizona. Why don't you call my parents and get me the hell out of here. Okay. Give me the number.

 I'll make the call. And then we'll see. Not until you talk to me. About what? The fact that you're still so clearly into Sutton? No, I'm not. Okay, so then why did you get mad at me for not telling you about Sutton and Thayer? And why did you just punch Thayer? Thayer pretty much deserved that, okay? And with you, I felt stupid, all right? It was like you knew something I didn't. Hey, you okay? Listen, if he's bothering you, we can just call security. Or my dad, the D.A. Dude, you are such a loser. And you are such a jerk. Whatever, man. You're still coming in second. That was a nice move though, sleeping with Sutton. Yeah, you know what? The truth is you're not gonna get over Sutton. And I probably won't either. My God.You slept with my brother? That's why Ethan attacked him last night? When did this happen? It was a long time ago. Before you left for L.A.? Why didn't you tell me about this? - I asked you point-blank. - I don't know. I... I found that photo, and you told me that it was just some hiking trip, that Thayer was my brother, so he was like a brother to you. No. Okay, look, it's not her fault.Okay? Things just got screwed up. No, you are the reason he left, aren't you? No, Mads. You've been in love with Sutton since forever. Everyone knows that. She sleeps with you while she's also apparently sleeping with Ethan? Mads, I didn't. I swear. You lied to my face. What kind of a friend does that? Okay, I... I think this is just a huge misunderstanding. Whatever you say. Could give my mom a run for her money. My first job was at Abercrombie. It's like the Harvard of folding. So, how does this all work? Like... You got to make sure the zipper's up and the button's closed before... No, not that. I mean, how did you pick this place? Are you afraid someone might move in? Yeah, all the time. I got a list of foreclosures. This house was on it. The bank will argue about it for a little bit, but, yeah, I got to watch my back. Pack up my stuff before school every day, stash it in my car just in case. I'm so sorry. Trust me. It beats the alternative. Is that the full report? Going to see the family now. Single car accident, nothing suspicious. Looks like Eduardo really did fall asleep behind the wheel. - Still, no witnesses. - That's too bad. Is it? What do you mean by that? He was headed out of town, Dan. That's good enough for me. Hey. Hey. Hey, how you feeling? What happened? An accident. Do you need anything? Do you want me to call someone? Can you... Can you get me some water? Yeah. Yeah, hang on. He's awake. Is everything okay? Do you need me to get Mads? It's you. I - I don't know what you mean. Alec... paid me. I heard him talking on the phone... about you. Well, what was he saying? Who was he talking to? Miss, you need to step out. Now! - Well, I... No, I... What did you say to him? Nothing, I swear. Well, something you did obviously upset him. Why were you in his room anyway? Mads, it's okay. We just need to stay calm. All right? You should go. Everything is falling apart. Of course I want to tell Mads everything. I feel like I'm ruing Sutton's relationship with one of her best friends. No. Okay, Sutton never told Mads or Char that she had a twin. Okay, if Mads is pissed about all the secrets, that's Sutton's fault, not yours. I keep trying to call her. There's no answer. Now it's going straight to voice mail. I mean, I know she's pissed about Ethan, but... Okay, since when do you need Sutton to tell you what to do? Alec was talking about me. Whatever Eduardo heard... If it was about us or the switch, or our adoption... Okay, I had no idea that my dad was wrapped up in all this. I told Sutton that Ted and Alec knew Annie from Scottsdale. Char's mom told me that they both broke her heart, and-and they're the reason why she went to L.A. So it can't be a coincidence that Ted adopted one of Annie's kids. I know. Maybe he was helping Annie, or rescuing her. I mean, she seems like she was in trouble. I got to go back in there and get Eduardo to talk. Hold on, hold on. Getting him to live is the first step. You're right. I... It's so weird. I keep feeling like someone is watching me. Okay, now you really are going crazy. - Dr. Hughes. - She's here. That girl you told me about. Says her name's Sutton Mercer, that she lives in Phoenix, that I should call her parents. Just like I said she would. There is a Sutton Mercer, she does live in Phoenix, but she's here with her parents right now. And I'm supposed to just take your word on all this? Absolutely. Just protecting Annie, Doctor, like we've done I understand, Alec, but... Annie's unstable, Doctor. Do I need to remind you what happens if this whole thing gets out of control? As well as a good size I've put my faith in you, Doc, chunk of my paycheck. Play ball. - What's going on? I need to... - You were so right. Justin is living in this empty house. He's a squatter. You're kidding. His parents died, he ran away from the foster system... All he wants is this golf scholarship. Isn't that cute? He only has two more years, but if anybody finds out, I mean, they'll send him straight back. Can't even imagine. So, since I'm usually the one covering for you, I thought you could help me out. I really like Justin. Like, really, really like him. - I know. - No. I mean... I think he might be the one. Hang on. Hang on. There is no such thing as "the one," and even if there were, don't you think you're a little young to have found him? Um, you were younger than I am right now when you lost your virginity. That, the one. Even before Luke, right? I mean, summer camp, that hot junior counselor? Yes. Do you even remember his name? So, what, there's different rules for me? Justin is a lucky guy. Just make sure he knows that. See ya. Thanks. Why didn't you tell me that Sutton's the reason you moved to L.A.? 'Cause she's not. I've been blaming Dad. And you should. He's the reason I left. And I'm starting to think he's a lot worse than I thought. Why? You don't think what happened with Eduardo is...? No, no. I just... I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. I - I hope I am. How's our friend? He's improving. Looks like he's gonna make it. That may not be a good thing. I know you don't want him dating Mads, but, uh... That's not it. He was at our house. I think he overheard me talking about Annie. This affects you, too, Ted. You got to keep those kids away from him. Especially Maddie. Hey, saw you at the hospital. Yeah. I saw you, too. What's that supposed to mean? What's the deal with you and Alec Rybak? How come you and I have both been on the receiving end of favors from that guy? He's the D.A. - He works closely with our department. But he's been helping you since before you were a cop. Hell, he's the reason you're a cop. What's the deal with you two? All right, look... there was a time where I was just a punk like you. And then I turned things around - Alec helped me with that. So now you owe him something? Ethan, I know how easy it is to go down the wrong path. But I was lucky, because someone helped me. That's all I really want for you. Whether it's Alec Rybak or someone else. The only thing you owe them is gratitude, that's it. - Hey, guys. - Hey. Hey, Mads. How you doing? I don't know. Yeah. Well, look, Eduardo's stabilized. Okay? And I will keep an eye on him for you. But you've got to go. Visiting hours are over. Well, couldn't you just say something to them? I mean, Eduardo could wake up any moment, and I really just want to be here. Well, you can't, Mads. Sometimes you girls just have to follow the rules, and the rules say you can't be here. Okay, sorry. You sure that's all this is, Dr. Mercer? What else would it be, Thayer? Just... take your sister home. Hey. I got your 911. What happened? Why aren't you at the hospital? Because of your dad - He told us to leave. Why did he do that? Why are you asking him? Mads, you're my best friend - I don't want things to be weird between us. Then enough with the secrets. That's why I texted you. I need to know what happened with Eduardo. Because before he left, he said that it was dangerous, that it had nothing to do with me or him or that stupid photo of us kissing. Did it have something to do with my dad? Come on, Sutton! You clearly know more than you're saying. We just... we just want to know. All right, fine, forget it. Took her a year to tell us about Ethan. She never even mentioned the fact that she slept with my brother. If we're lucky, maybe sometime freshman year in college she'll tell us what this is all about. - Mads, wait... - No. Right now I need my best friends around me, and I'm starting to realize that that is not you. Hey! Emma, stop! God! I'm so sorry. I can't believe I did that. I c... Sorry. Are you okay? I'm fine, all right? Lucky for me, you're not a very good shot with that thing, okay? Look... I'm sorry if I scared you. I just wanted to come by and talk to you. Ethan... can we please just do this later? All right. But I'm still gonna follow you home, make sure you're all right. I'm still mad at you. Great. Yep, that's flat. You're not going anywhere in that thing. Okay, that might have worked with Sutton. Difference here is, I can change my own tire. Sexy. There's no spare. That's too bad. I was really hoping to watch you change it. I'm walking home. It's, like, two miles. Two miles is nothing. Come on, don't be stupid - I'll give you a ride on my bike. That is so your M.O. And you so wish. I'm not putting my arms around you. Chinese all right? Figure you can get Mexican in Los Angeles anytime you want... That's fine, yeah, whatever. It's good to have you home, son. All right, I'll, uh... I'll go get it. Hey. If Dad's really the reason that you left, then why did you come back? Was it for me? Did something happen in L.A.? 'Cause I really just don't want to pull you away from your work. No, it's not you. There is nothing for me in L.A. Thayer, what are you talking about? Look, I'm here for you as long as you need me. Okay? Okay. Feels good to come in through the front door. Not sure how much longer I'll be allowed to do that. Welcome to my world. Do you want me to leave? I don't know. You could've just said bye to me on the doorstep. I know. I really want to believe that what we have has nothing to do with Sutton. Well, believe it. Okay? I feel closer to you right now than I have ever felt to her. Why? I - I don't know, I mean... you and I are more alike. And that night when we kissed at the dance... it felt like I had found something that I didn't even know I was looking for. It just felt right. Sorry. Romantus Interruptus. Carry on. It's okay. Ethan was... just leaving. Good timing. Always. Still haven't found a way for him to spend the night? Ooh, we are so not there yet. And not that I would with... Mom and Dad down the hall. I got to say, having a boyfriend who lives in an abandoned house alone has its perks. So you're gonna spend the night with Justin? I don't know. Maybe. So, tell me what it was like. I don't need the fabulous, sexy version, just the truth. Was it... scary or intense or... totally worth it? It's all about being with the right guy. Okay? And... you haven't known Justin for very long. And I know he seems incredible now, but... Laurel, I would hate for you to... rush into it and then get your heart broken down the line. Make sure Justin is the one. Really. No regrets. You deserve that. Okay. Can't say this is how I thought it would go, but I'm kind of loving it in a Gilmore Girls kind of way. You'd have to be Lorelai, 'cause I'm so obviously Rory. Clearly. Hello? Hi. Is there a Sutton Mercer at this number? And she's there in Phoenix right now? Yeah. I'm looking right at her. Who is this, anyway? Could I speak with her? Some rude bee-yatch is on the phone for you. I'm guessing you maxed out the plastic again. Hello? - Sutton? - Yes? Who is this? Thank God. Did you call my parents? I did. And I spoke with the real Sutton Mercer, who's home in Phoenix right now. No. That's my twin. See, we switched places. She is taking over my life, pretending to be me. - Really? - Yes, really. Why didn't she tell you that? Her name is Emma Becker. No. You're Emma Becker. It says so on the driver's license in your purse. That's not my driver's license, it's hers! I gave her mine. I gave her my house, I gave her my car, I gave her my-my parents, everything. - Calm down. - No. There has got to be a way I can prove this to you. Like, don't you do fingerprints or... a DNA test? - There has to be something... - Can I have some help in here? Can you please just listen to me! - There has to be... - No, I'm-I'm fine. I'm fine. I don't know what I was talking about. I am... I am Emma Becker. I am. I'm sorry. I don't need anything, I'm fine. I'm sorry. - Are we okay, Doctor? - It's ok. Good morning. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, sorry, I'm just so used to walking in. Yeah, with Sutton. We just met. What's going on? I hacked into my dad's computer. I was looking for something that might explain what Eduardo might have overheard, why my dad would have paid him to leave town. What did you find? Not much, except a bunch of phone calls between my dad and, and Char's new boyfriend Derek. Why would Alec be calling him? No idea. All I know is, I got to talk to Char. No, no, you start opening up, telling things to Char and Mads, they're going to know I'm not Sutton. Well, maybe it's time. I mean, you feel terrible and I don't like lying to my sister. I'm not ready, okay? I'm not ready to lose all this. Guessing you mean Ethan. Not just him, but... It's stupid, I know. You know, maybe you're right, maybe I should just go back to Vegas and see my best friend Lexi... Look, that's not what I meant. Okay, it doesn't have to be like that. You're right. I just need to get back to the hospital, find out what Eduardo knows... if, if he knows about us, that there are twins. We are shut out of the hospital. There's even a key code after hours. Okay, well, I'll find the code and sneak in. What are you guys doing? Strategy session - and I get it, dude, she is just like Sutton. But better. I got to go see Char. Okay, this is my dad we're talking about, and Char just might be my way in. What's he talking about? It's just a long story. Okay. Are you jealous that I'm working with Thayer and not you? I'm not jealous. Right, just like you're not still into Sutton. Mind if I join you? You know Mads isn't here? Actually, I'm here to see you. Be my guest. So, is this where you and Derek hang out? Some. That's actually how he made his first move. I found him here; he wanted to surprise me. Wow, that is romantic. No, I just asked because Derek is a little off the beaten path. Right? It was our bad boy phase. Sutton and weird guy, Mads and old guy, me and super hot guy. No, anyway, though, I was just wondering, do you have any idea why my dad would be calling Derek, why Derek would be calling him back? Your dad's been calling my boyfriend? Yeah, has he mentioned him? Um, dads aren't exactly what we talk about, not that we talk that much anyway. All right, look, I totally get the whole bad boy phase thing, but I just don't want to see you get hurt. Right, 'cause I'm like a sister to you. Right, and you're totally smoking hot. Thayer. How are you doing today, Emma? Almost ready to go home? Sure. It's just difficult sometimes, you know, confusing. I don't know, maybe it's just 'cause I'm tired or... I just think I need another night. Let me see what I can do. You seem fine to me. Well, maybe I want to stay. Hey, who do I have to be nice to around here to get out of my room more than twice a day? Well, just how nice were you thinking? Hey, I got your text. What's going on? Hi, so I can't find this code anywhere. Ted doesn't seem to write any of this stuff down, so... I know that you're like this computer guy. Sure. Let me check it out. Man. Typical old guy mistake. He may not write anything on paper, but he keeps a file called Passwords, and of course his Password file is password-protected, but... SuttonLaurel. That was easy. Wow, you are good at this. Well, how do you think Sutton found you in the first place? Hey, guys. What are you doing? Nothing. Thayer is, is just helping me transfer files from when I borrowed Dad's... What are you doing? You don't think this is one of those $1,000 bottles, do you? I'm pretty sure Dad put those under lock and key after you stole that one last spring. Right. Which was delicious. Can you just give us a second? Actually, I think we're done here. I'll see you later. - So I guess... - Tonight's the night. You sure about this? Totally - Justin is so the right guy. No regrets. I'm just gathering my props. Scent... sound. Safety? You don't by any chance have a... Please, I'm the smart one, remember? Way too smart to get pregnant, at least not right now. Great. So should we, like, hug, or is that...? Yeah, that's weird. - Okay. - Have a good night. So tell me about that day at the pool. What made you come over? Well, I'd been eyeing you at school for a while. Tried to get your attention at homecoming, but all that got me was a cupcake. So I figured, got to step it up a notch. Really? That's so cute. But Mads' dad? I know this sounds crazy, but I also know he's been calling you, so... Who's Mads' dad? Alec Rybak - The D.A.? Him. Listen, not my finest hour, but I was arrested for possession. Really just holding it for a friend, you know how that is. Yeah, sure. The D.A. was super cool. He helped me out, hooked me up with some community service. So that's why he's been calling you? Why do you think he was calling me? And how do you even know that he was? I don't know. Let's just go back to kissing. Sounds good to me. All right, you've got 15 minutes, and then you'd better have your ass back in here. Yeah, no problem. I'm going to need to borrow this. Hi, Mom. It's Sutton. Your daughter. Your daughter. It's really you. Yeah. You have to tell me everything, okay, why you put us up for adoption, why you separated us, why you went back for Emma and not me. How did you find me? It wasn't easy, but finding you meant everything to me. Please tell me what happened. The fire. In Fillmore when you were with Emma. It's so hard knowing that... I killed my own child. You mean Emma? No, Emma's not dead. She's pretending to be me in Phoenix right now. No, she died. They told me - Both of them. She's dead. He told me. Both of who? What do you mean? Who told you? Stop. Don't try to confuse me. He wouldn't lie to me. Who's he? Who is he?! Help! - Mom, no. Mom, please stop. - Please! No. No. Please! I'm not... I'm not talking to you anymore. No, I'm not. Get away from me. Get away from me! - Please. I just... - You are not real. - You're not real. You're not. - Yes, I am. - Help me! She's dead. - She's not dead. No, she's not dead. No! - Get her away from me. - Don't.Stop it! Please stop! - They told me she's dead! - No, she's not! I feel, uh... under-dressed. Or maybe over-dressed? I just wanted to make the place special, because I wanted tonight to be special. Every night is special with you. Yes.lt's talk like that that got me here. I just feel really connected to you, after you told me what happened to your parents, trusted me enough to let me in. Laurel... Am I totally off-base here? I mean, should I just go get dressed and never show my face to you again? No, no, you're... The truth is... I'm really starting to fall for you, Laurel. I'm really starting to fall for you, too.I mean... That's a good thing, right? Sure. I've imagined this, but I never imagined that it would feel like this. How's it feel? Scary. And, uh... amazing. How about we... just focus on the amazing part? We could do that. God, you are incredible. You really are. Hey, handsome. You don't look so good. Coffee. That's the key - you go on those long drives, you want to drink lots of coffee. What do you remember... about the phone call you heard in my house? Nothing. Sutton, Dr. Hughes, Annie... They're just names to me. Good man. So we're good, right? You don't want anything, do you? I want Mads. That's not going to happen. Get some rest. Hey. What are you doing here? I might not be your boyfriend, but I still care about you. I wanted to make sure you were safe. Safe from what? What are you guys doing here? What are you doing with him? And did you even ask him about Emma? No, forget that. What is going on with you and Eduardo? Look, she can't tell you. All right? And she's got to go in there alone. Screw you. I don't care how long you've been sneaking around with her. Sutton is my best friend. Or at least she was. It's fine. It's fine. Let them come with us. You know what that means. Let's just do this. He's not breathing. He's seizing. Find the strap muscles. Heart rate's at 140. Can't get an airway. We're going to have to tube this guy. Get me 30 of etomidate and a 7.5 trach. Nurse! What's the heart rate? - Dad? - Get out. Now! - Where's that tube? - Got it. Now, hold steady. Steady. Got to make an incision. There you are. Where have you been? Laurel's still not home. It's 2:00 a. m. She's usually so responsible. She just got her driver's license. - She could be in a ditch somewhere... - Hang on. Hold on. What? I tried calling her cell. There was no answer. Then I-I did that thing that we said only in case of an emergency. I know it's a violation of trust... You went online, you used that cell phone tracking app. Fine. And I got an address. It just wasn't Justin's house, which is good. She's not shacking up with her boyfriend or something. What do you want to do? I want to go over there. Okay, okay. So he's in a coma? That's what they said. Mads, I'm so sorry. Prove it. You were going to let us find out the truth at the hospital. So now you can tell us what's going on. Please. Fine. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you any of this, but the truth is, I'm really close to finding my birth mother. And your dad... I think your dad might know who she is. What makes you think my dad has any idea who your birth mother is? And what does that have to do with Eduardo? He told me Alec paid him to leave town. - I knew it. - Not just to get you two apart. Your dad's worried that Eduardo overheard him on the phone saying something about me. What was he saying? I would love to know, but... Eduardo didn't make it that far. And you thought it was about your birth mother? But what could be so terrible about her that my dad wouldn't want you to find out? Maddie, I just heard. I'm sorry. You okay? Something is not right. Yeah, that find-my-phone app thing. Clearly Big Brother's not watching us, or if he is, he's looking in the wrong place. Laurel? Mom, Dad, um... Nothing happened. I - I just, uh, fell asleep. What is this place? No. It's so weird. No one's home. And it's late. I know Ted was at the hospital, but, um... I'm not trying to beat a dead horse here, but I could stay. Ethan. Or not. I mean, are you going to be all right if I leave? Of course. Yeah. I'll just set the alarm, and, I don't know, take a hot bath. Try and relax. Okay. I'm just trying to stay sane. With everything that's happening... I just don't want to lose myself again. Not that I don't want to. I'm not going to go anywhere, okay? You have to. Look, I'm sorry for all the trouble that I've caused, but can't this wait until the morning? It's time. Your driver's waiting. Sorry, I know it's a long drive, but I'm going to have to cuff you. What? What is going on? I thought I was going home. You are, Emma - Home to Vegas. Hello? Mom? Dad? Hey, Emma. Travis, what the hell are you doing here? So you've got a twin. What'd you do, kill her?
