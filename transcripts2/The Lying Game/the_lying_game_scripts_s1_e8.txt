 Previously on The Lying Game... Ethan! You're still so clearly into Sutton. Alec paid me. I don't know what you mean. About you. - You need to step out. - No, I... I came to find my birth mother, and you've held me here against my will. What? What is going on? I thought I was going home.

 You are, Emma. Home to Las Vegas. I wanted tonight to be special. I'm really starting to fall for you, Laurel. Laurel? I'm not gonna go anywhere, okay? You have to. My pervy foster brother set me up and said I was stealing. Hey, Emma. So you've got a twin. What'd you do, kill her? I really need to get that. Is that so?

 Maybe you'd like a mani-pedi, too. Your caseworker gets here, you get your call. Travis, school is out of the question. I told you where we'd meet, so be there or forget it. Hey, everything okay? Yeah, it's fine. - Was that Sutton? - Are you serious? She hasn't spoken to me since she saw those pictures of us kissing at homecoming. Well, there were a lot of them. Guess she's still jealous. Why? It's not like we're a couple. No one said we were. You want to tell me what's going on? I mean, yesterday, we were getting along fine, and now, all of a sudden, I'm bothering the hell out of you. Let's just say, you can't run from your past. Sooner or later, it'll track you down. I don't know what people around here have been telling you about me, but there's... Ethan, I'm sorry. It's not... it's not you. It's about my life. Is that Sutton? Or not. I can't be late for class. Wait, wait, come here. Look, I realize I screwed up, all right? You and I make a pretty good team. Just let me help you. I'm sorry, I just-- I have a lot on my plate right now. Moved? No, that's not possible. We were just there last night. Well, moved where? Uh, well, can you tell me the address of this new place? Confidential? Why would it be confidential? At the request of his mother? Okay, thanks. Oh, my God. Guys, they moved Eduardo to another hospital. If I hadn't told him my feelings, none of this would've even happened. - That's not true. - You can't say that. Okay, I'm sorry, guys. Maybe I should just go. No. Not on my watch. Look, I know this is awful, but if you think your friends are gonna let you go through it alone, you're crazy. We're gonna go inside, pop some popcorn, find some Real Housewives to veg out to, whatever. But we're gonna stick together, right? Sounds like a plan. You're the best. I'll join you guys later. I'm so sorry. I have to do... an errand. For my parents. I mean, seriously? Okay, that was uncool. What? First of all, you're running around all paranoid, convinced that someone is after you. Now your best friend is grieving, and you say you got to, what, pick up some paper towels or something? You don't understand. No, I don't. 'Cause in my book, car wrecks, comas, almost dying sort of trump birth mother search. This isn't just about that! Then tell me what it is about. Because that way, I can go in there and try and cover for you. I can't do this now. You must love doing everything alone. No. No, I hate it. Still don't see why we couldn't have worked this out in your bedroom last night. Much nicer venue. So what's your plan? Get me sent back to foster care in Vegas? Look, I don't give a crap about your Nancy Drew mystery. I just want a little piece of the action. You find a time the Mercers aren't home, leave a door unlocked... No, Travis. I can't. They have been like family to me. And I'm sure you've been just like family to them in return. You know, honest and up front. Chillax, sis. We're not gonna clean them out. Just lift a few things. We do it right, they don't even notice. Like this, for instance. Wait for my call. Knew I could count on you. After all, we're family. ♪ Uh ♪ ♪ Lying Game 1x08 ♪ Never Have I Ever Original Air Date on October 3, 2011 == sync, corrected by elderman == ♪ Uh, uh-uh ♪ ♪ Uh, uh-uh, uh ♪ ♪ Watch out for this girl ♪ ♪ She's got a gun for a tongue. ♪ Yeah, I liked the guy. But when I saw him in bed with my daughter, I liked him a hell of a lot less. Again, nothing happened. "Nothing happened." I just... We fell asleep. I just find that so hard to believe. We decided we weren't ready. He wants to wait. He said that I was worth waiting for. Well, he's right. You are. Still doesn't explain how you ended up in that situation, I mean, on the floor of some deserted house. He doesn't want to live like that, Dad. He needs help. Okay, sweetheart, I feel sorry for the guy, but the responsible thing to do is contact the authorities. He'll get kicked out of Arroyo and the golf team. I mean, that's his dream. Sutton, will you tell them what happened in that documentary you saw? Uh, yeah, it was really bad. This girl ran away from this horrible family and ended up on the streets. - See? - It's one example. You can't generalize about every foster family in the United States of America. Okay, so it's Justin's fault that he's all alone? Why should he have to keep paying for stuff that happened to his parents? Okay, I will make some calls. We'll find him a place to stay so he that he can stay in Arroyo. - You're the best. - Yeah. If you're think of getting rid of anything, I won't say no to pearls. I just wanted to say thanks for having my back in there. Yeah, sure. Justin seems great. You have no idea. I'm so glad you waited. You actually bought that in there? There was no waiting at the Squatter Inn. Let's just say, been there, done that. Are you sure you're not moving a little too fast? To be honest, I was... kind of scared. The first time was definitely more weird than great. But he was just... so nice and so caring. And that was beautiful. This isn't just some random hookup. We're in love. I mean, who am I talking to? It's like with you and Ethan. When you have something so great, why would you wait? Hey, guys.What say we go down to the country club and hit a few buckets? I'm kind of busy. No, I already have plans with Char and Sutton. I'm really sorry about Eduardo. Hmm? I said I'm sorry about Eduardo. Why? I'll probably never see him again. You got just what you wanted. Maddie, I know I haven't always been a perfect parent. I want a do-over. A fresh start. Can I ask you something? Anything. What do you know about Sutton's adoption? Only what Ted's told me. Um, that the past few months has been really rough on him and Kristin both. With Sutton's search and all, it's just... So, you guys talk about it a lot? I mostly listen. He's taking this pretty tough. I just try to be there for him. Hmm. I felt so awful having to leave earlier. So, anyway, are you sure this isn't valuable? All costume pieces. Okay, I promise you I will pay you back every cent, even if it takes me a while. Come on, can't you at least give me a hint what this is about? I told you. Charity work. I love charity work. And you're an awesome friend. Now, that I believe. What's so funny? An allergy pillow protector. That may be a first. How is that so hard to grasp? I have seasonal allergies, and this is a breeding ground for dust mites and bacteria. A pillow protector probably only costs... I have no idea. I bet it's not a lot, though. Let's focus here. The good news is, you're a minor. They have to grant your initial hearing within 48 hours. Hearing? What? I told you, I haven't done anything. Truancy, delinquency, petty theft, assault, identity theft, fraud, breaking and entering. Just jump in when this starts to ring a bell. This is all a misunderstanding. People are confusing me with my identical twin sister. I'm gonna stop you there, okay? And I am on your side here, honestly. Word to the wise though, suck it up and tell the truth, you get out fast. You start spinning wacko stories about identical twins, and you can expect to be in here a while. Not bad, sis, not bad. If I were you, I'd wait till Vegas to fence it. Pawn it around here and it might raise some questions. You know, we hit up a couple of your friends' houses, we could score big-time. No. This was a one-off, remember? That was our deal. Fair enough. I'll keep my end of the deal. But I think we should seal it to make it official. Get off me! Just sealing the deal. Ethan. Wait. - Hi. - Hi. So, about yesterday-- I was feeling really overwhelmed, and I'm sorry if I was rude. You're a good friend; we've been through a lot. Wasn't fair. And... here's where I was hoping you would say something back. Like... we make a good team? Let me help you? I thought I said that yesterday. I guess we're good. Yeah, it's a room where members sleep it off. Good think is, you're right over the clubhouse. It's not Buckingham Palace, but it'll keep you in school. Are-Are you kidding me? This place is amazing. I talked to Mario in the clubhouse, too. He's gonna throw you a few shifts, shagging range balls. Give you a little extra spending money. This is really nice of you, Dr. Mercer. I don't know what to say. I know you've been dealt a pretty tough hand, Justin, and I just want you to know that I appreciate that you've been a gentleman with my daughter. Of course. Should that change, though, I will have to kill you. I'm kidding. But this room is off-limits to Laurel. Same goes for you in her bedroom. Are we clear on that? You have my word. I gotta hand it to you-- I mean, you certainly travel light. No-- This is, uh... That's okay. Hey... I'm a surgeon-- nobody touches my instruments. All right, well, enjoy your new digs. You really think this is a smart idea? Honey, come on! This is Sedona. Look at this place. A weekend, no kids, no stress, just the two of us. Well, and 2,000 deadly dull plastic surgery colleagues. Okay, first off: ouch. Second, look-- I'll go to two seminars max. The rest, it will be swimming, biking, spa treatments-- this'll be good for us, to be a couple. You're really not concerned about this at all? Of course I'm concerned, okay? Aren't we supposed to trust our kids? Okay, our ears are burning. Your mother and I are going away this weekend. Oh, yeah! That plastic surgery conference. Ugh! Just the sound of it. Romantic getaway-- yes. So here we go, house rules: No parties, okay? No boys, no booze, no Justin's place. So, basically, no fun. See? They get it. Yeah. You can totally trust us. I thought I could always trust you; it's just, you... Okay, Mom-- Justin-- the whole thing with that was a mistake. I won't happen again, I promise. We'll be good, right? Definitely. You guys should go. Okay. See? We got permission. I think we need this. We are so going to blow the roof off this place. - Hello? - You lied to me. Annie? All this time, you let me believe that I killed my daughter. Now, you know that's crazy. Sutton told me Emma is alive. Sutton is a schizophrenic. You're a liar! She has been diagnosed with adolescent onset schizophrenia, Annie. She stopped taking her medication. I'm really sorry you had to meet her like that. She was such a lovely young girl. All these lies. She has a loving family now, Annie. They'll care for her; give her the help she needs. Leave this one alone. Let this story have a happy ending. What about my happy ending? You look pretty. Mm! You think? I'd like to do you right here. As poetic as that sounds, it's a little unhygienic around food prep. - My bad. - I'll get it. Trying to use adult glassware was clearly a mistake. It's fine. I'll stick to the casual elegance of red plastic. My God, you were cute! Like, kid model cute. You say that like I've turned into some hideous beast. Ah, you're okay-- I mean, like, in a first wife sort of way. Okay, that's it, you're dead. It's all fun until someone ends up in tears. What is your obsession with family albums, anyway? Get off your butt and come help me. Hey, I have years to catch up on. You and Justin seem really great together. Yeah... he's pretty amazing. Hey, are you okay? Seem kind of sad. Where's Ethan? Hello! Hey. - How you doing? - Good. How are you? - Good. - Hi! - Good. How are you doin'? - Good. Thayer. Hey... are you all right? Oh... yeah. I'm going to go out on a limb here-- does this have anything to do with Ethan? Can someone please tell me what that guy has that's so special? I mean, doesn't that intense brooding shtick get old? We had a fight. Not a fight, but... a stupid argument at school. Oh, but I thought you guys were, uh... broken up? Yeah. But... But you don't want to be broken up. I don't know. And you know how he feels, obviously. No, I... I don't know. Uh-huh. Of all times I really need to talk to somebody-- not that I would ever talk to Sutton about this... Uh-huh. Of course. Do you mind? It's... a little rude. Right. Sorry. Can I ask you something? Not that it's any of my business, but it does affect my situation-- what is going on with you and Sutton? Here's the deal: Nothing. The thing with Sutton was a mistake. It was a result of misread cues... regrettable... disastrous... the sooner forgotten the better. At least those were the words she used to soften the blow for me. Sorry. Yeah, so was I. And then I got mad. And, in fact, I told her she had to go find a new place to live... which is probably why she's gone AWOL. And Sutton is still into Ethan. Big-time. That's why I couldn't be around her. Even though she's totally kidding herself. Why do you say that? Are you seriously that naive? You really don't see why? The reason she's kidding herself is because that guy's so into you. As for Sutton-- who knows? Is that who you were texting? Oh, no, that was Ethan. I was just telling him to get his sorry ass over to this party. You two were made for each other. Let someone be happy, right? Didn't I tell you this would be great? It has been nice. And, you know, honestly, I haven't worried about things at home once. See? Gotta be able to trust your kids. Every once in a while, it's okay to leave your problems behind. Mm. Ted? Ted Mercer? It's me-- Tom. Tom List? Craniofacial. Hey... hey, buddy. I haven't seen you guys since that insane weekend in Santa Barbara. Gotta be 20 years. Annie, right? Kristin. That's my wife... Kristin. Senior moment. I'm the worst with names. Especially after a few too many martinis. It's good to bump into you again, Ted. Kristin. Have a good weekend. Yeah, you, too. Don't be mad at me. I'm not mad. You're so far away right now. I thought that's how you wanted it. No! No, not at all. The truth is, there was something going on yesterday, and it was big and it was stressful, but I needed to deal with it on my own, and I did, and it's... it's done. It's over. And I feel so much better. So could we just move on? Secrets were always Sutton's thing. I just thought you were different. I am different. I am. I'm sorry that I pushed you away. I wa... I want to tell you everything and... who knows how... much time we have until Sutton walks through that door and I have to give back these glass slippers. I want us to be together. Now, while we still can. So you've told me everything. Okay, guys, who's ready for some "Never Have I Ever"? ♪ ♪ Sutton... are you in? Yeah. Somebody should explain the rules to Justin. Uh, yeah, I'm sure I can piece it together. Just so you know-- this is cranberry juice and club soda. Alcohol makes me loud and stupid. Isn't that the whole point of the game? I can have fun without turning in to my mother. You know, I don't feel comfortable with people drinking and driving. Then I will be the designated driver. I have no interest in secrets, anyway. Oh, my brother can give me a ride. Would anybody like some more vino? Is this a good idea? Not if you've got something to hide. Honey, it didn't mean anything. But Annie... I mean, isn't that odd? It's a pretty common name. I mean... it's not like it was Apple, or Blanket. Something. Plus, you can't listen to that bozo; the guy was hammered. Just be glad he wasn't performing a bone graft on you. I've never been to Santa Barbara. Neither have I. You know, we should go sometime. ♪ ♪ Okay. Never have I ever shoplifted. Derek. Shoplifting's a chick thing. Not when you're stealing a belt sander. Never have I ever... kissed a girl. Nope. All right. You never told me! It was at soccer camp. One time. Never have I ever... pictured the lunch lady buck naked. Hold on. Which one? Dude. The hot chick with the big ass, not the unibrow and the hairnet... Oh... I guess either of them. Thanks, dude. Now we all have. Hey, listen. I just wanted to thank you. - For... - Yeah. Sure. It's a fun party. What? No. No, no, no. For telling us about your whole birth mother search. And if there's anything that I could do, to help, you know... Never have I ever... gone all the way with someone that I truly love. ♪ ♪ Never have I ever... kissed someone in the past 24 hours. Intriguing, but I'm sorry... Wish I had the chance. - Whoa, hey.... - What? I'm going to head home. You sure? Yeah, I've got to work tomorrow. Why don't you stay and help me clean up? Uh, I can drop Char and Derek off, and then swing by the club for Justin. Uh, I'm gonna be going with him, too. Okay. I don't know. Justin's house? Mom and Dad were very clear. I'm not doing anything wrong. I just want to spend the night with the guy I love. Please be careful. Always. See you in the morning. Try and sober up, okay? Ooh... What are we doing? What are we waiting for? I think... we should... you know... I think you've had too much to drink. Mm-mm, I'm fine. I'm fine. Don't patronize me. I'm serious. Really. It's you and me, babe. Did you just call me "babe"? That was the wine talking, but... That's interesting. All right. I'm going to put you to bed. No, I'm going to put you to bed, mister. Okay, that'll do. All right. Mm, my hero. Okay. Here. Why don't you want me? Is it because I've had just a little, teensy, tiny bit too much to drink? We'll talk about it tomorrow. I don't want to talk about it tomorrow. You're a really hard guy to be in a relationship with, you know that? You're in, and then you're out, and then... who knows what you want? Come back. Back from the party? Looks that way. You have fun? Mads have fun? I don't know, ask her. Sit down, sit down, Thayer. Listen, I know you got a lot of anger directed at me right now. It's understandable. I've been a bit of a hardass, haven't I? When it comes to your future, and... law school, a clerkship, a job at the D.A... Probably right across the hall from your office. Yeah. You had my whole future planned out for me, didn't you? I guess I did. And you don't see how messed up that is? I do, and that's what I want to talk to you about, okay? There's no way to say it... I messed up. Yeah, okay. Thayer, you know, the-these last few months, of you being in L.A. and us not talking... that's, that's not good. We used to do stuff together, you and me. We'd go to the batting cages, or we'd go to the driving range. Yeah, well, we haven't done that stuff in years. That doesn't mean I don't miss it like hell. Son, I'm not going to interfere in your life. I'm going to stay out of it. But I got a little advice for you. Don't let anyone else stand in your way, either. Meaning? Sutton. I know how you feel about her. Okay. Thayer. What is this? It's just a little something. That's for your gaming. Should be enough to get a presentation together. Then down the line, maybe I can introduce you to some V.C. guys. And rustle up some real money. - Dad, why are you doing this? - I miss you. I don't care about a future lawyer. I want my son back. Well, aren't I going to get the house tour? We can start in the great rooms and then work our way through. It's perfect. All thanks to your dad. All thanks to my persuasion. Yeah, that too. Um, okay, I'm not going to dock you any style points since you just moved in, but pretty soon we will have to go house shopping. That's cool. Uh-oh. What's that? I'm guessing baseball cards or comic books and hoping it isn't porn. Hey, oh... Let's give it some time. I just moved in. Okay. I won't touch a thing. Now... I never said that. I like the way you think. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. What are you thinking now? Hello, you've reached the Mercers. Please leave a message. Sure you don't want to leave a message? At least someone will know you're here. No, I don't want to waste my call. I'll just try again later. Hey, sis. What are you doing here? A red flag went up when you told me to wait till I got home to fence this. Funny, the pawn shop here in Phoenix says this is all fake costume junk. Any idea why that might be? I have no idea. I'll get you some real stuff now. Get you a ring, this... Oh! I think you're gonna give me more than that. You look hot, Emma. Oh, God. Who knew the combination of white trash and social poser could be such a turn-on? Ew, Travis, you're disgusting. What are you doing? Uh... I'm-I'm sorry, um... It's just, you seemed so secretive about it and I wanted... You wanted to know what was in it. Don't you remember what curiosity did to the cat? It got her a pretty awesome present. It was my mom's. I've been waiting for a special occasion, but I guess this is as special as any. Um... I'm never taking this off. Why didn't you tell me you saw this creep kiss me? Figured it was up to you to tell me. I didn't know why you were upset. You were tormenting me by not saying anything. And you know what? I'm so over this "man of few words" act. Well, why wouldn't you tell me that this guy was here extorting you? Because if anything bad happened, I didn't want you to get in trouble. It's not like it would have been your first strike. And that's the entire reason? Well, yeah! What else would there be? What are you not telling me? I was embarrassed, okay? I was ashamed about what I come from. You do realize I live in a trailer. I'm surrounded by rusty motorcycles and spare car parts. But all you've seen me as is this princess wearing Sutton's gorgeous clothes, and driving her swanky car. And it was this fantasy, and I didn't want it to end. But I knew that if you saw this-- saw who I really was-- it'd just be over. That may be the dumbest thing you've ever said. Plus, I was afraid you might kill him. And I wasn't very far off. I mean, look at us. All of a sudden, we're in a Coen Brothers movie. He's fine. I mean, the guy deserves a lot worse than what he got. I knew there was someone in the house when I got up to get the phone. The phone? Who was calling in the middle of the night? Las Vegas Juvenile Detention Center. You don't think... Oh, my God... Sutton? Hey, I'm home. Sutton? Rise and shine. Hello? Laurel, thank God. It's Sutton. Hey, Sutton, are you... at Ethan's? No, why would you think that? Well, you were pretty buzzed last night and basically throwing yourself at him by the end of the night, so... Hello? Girls? Hold on. Empty sighting. Hello! Dude, you gotta come home right now. Mom and Dad just got back. Wait, no! I need help. I'm stuck in Ju... Come on! Sorry, you know the rules. One phone call. I... No, I-I need to get a message to somebody. You don't understand. Mm-hmm. Letter's always nice. Hello, darling. - You guys are back early. - We wanted to catch you in the act of throwing that big blowout party. Yes, well, as you can see, it's all cleaned up. That's a nice bracelet. I haven't seen that before. Yeah. Where'd you get that? Oh... um... a little vintage shop downtown. You always have such a good eye for jewelry. Yeah, no kidding. Where's Sutton? Probably having breakfast at the club. She's such a princess. Hey, Mom and Dad... you should know that the girl living in my room right now and calling herself "Sutton" isn't me. She's stolen my identity, my family and friends, and I'm now afraid of how far she'll go to keep me from taking my life back. What are you looking at? Didn't we have an old photograph of Annie Sewell in here? This isn't because of what that drunk said at the conference, is it? I don't know. I just can't seem to get her out of my head for some reason. I could swear we had an old photograph. You know, I haven't looked at that thing in years. Hey, one of the pages has been torn out. Could've been one of the kids when they were younger. What happened to her? Annie Sewell. Who knows? I think she pretty much fell off the grid. Annie? Time for your meds. Annie? Ms. Hobbs? Doctor? What makes you think I won't go straight to the cops, tell them all about Emma's sister scam? Go ahead. Something tells me they're gonna be more interested in you. Breaking and entering, extortion, sexual assault. That's ten to 20, easy. What are you, a legal expert? No, I'm an eyewitness, douche. Okay, so it was definitely Sutton who called your house. Apparently, she was sent from some psych clinic in L.A. Oh, my God. Yeah, well, here's the good news, is they dropped Emma's assault charges on this idiot. So, Sutton's being released. Okay, well, why isn't she answering the phone? I've called her and texted her. Probably took her phone. Who would post bail for Emma Becker? They wouldn't give me any more information. Sorry. Wow! You got both these dudes whipped. Must be making it worth their while, huh? You want to take a trip to the hospital, huh? Hey, hey, relax, relax! All right. Okay. Come on. Here's the deal. You're gonna get in this crapbox and you're gonna go to whatever hole you crawled out of. No stops, no detours. Oh, and do obey the speed limits. If I ever catch you in Phoenix again... a prison sentence will be the least of your worries. We do hope you've enjoyed your stay. Come back and visit anytime. So, you're seriously not gonna tell me who signed to let me out? Told you, it says "anonymous." Doesn't happen every day. You must have friends in high places. Yo! Emma! Get over here! Hi... Thought everybody got one call from Juvie. Or is that just, like, urban legend? Uh, no, that's true, actually. Uh-huh. And you don't use yours to call your best friend? Bi-atch, you got some 'splaining to do. Get in the car. Sorry. Do you remember my, uh, cousin Norman? The like, thick-necked-- do you want a chip?-- bull-neck, ex-Marine homophobic guy who has like all the Patti LuPone CDs? I mean, dude, like, don't ask, don't tell, just don't kid yourself. Uh... right... No... He works Juvie security, and he found out that you were getting sprung. So, lucky for you, I was able to go home, and, uh, jumpstart the ol' Pequod. Thanks, Lexi, for not leaving me on the side of the road in the desert and having to walk home. Right, thank you. It's cool. Dude, what happened to "I'm gonna call you every three days," huh? Did you hear from You-Know-Who? Do you know what your next move is gonna be? It's cool. You can just tell me everything while we drive. == sync, corrected by elderman == www.tvsubtitles.net
