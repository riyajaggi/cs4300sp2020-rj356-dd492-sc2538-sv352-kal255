 OVER A SLAVE WHO’S ABOUT TO GET KILLED. HE’S LOOKING UP FOR PERMISSION AT A GUY WHO’S CLEARLY NEHRO WHO’S DOING THAT. IN OTHER WORDS, KILL HIM. I SAID, I’LL DO IT. HE WENT, YOU HAVEN’T READ THE SCRIPT. I SAID I DON’T CARE. I THINK WE CAN GET THIS RIGHT. LET’S DO IT. WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE? ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED? IS THIS NOT WHY YOU ARE HERE? AND LISTENED TO HALF A DOZEN VOCALS WITH RIDLEY ABOUT RUSSELL. I THOUGHT HE WAS REALLY A RAW TALENT WHO WAS, I THINK, JUST DISCOVERING THE POWER HE HAD. SLAVE!

 DESIMUSBERIDIOUS. LOYAL SERVANT TO THE TRUE EMPEROR MARCUS OHRYIOUS. FATHER TO A MURDERED SON. HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE, AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE IN THIS LIFE OR THE NEXT. HE’S A CHARACTER ACTOR, AND THAT’S, THAT’S WHAT HE LOVES IS TO, IS TO FULLY CREATE A CHARACTER. OLD, WORTHLESS, DISCARDED. AND WHILE YOU ROT THE WORLD WILL BURN TO ASHES. YOU’RE NOT REAL! YOU ARE NOT REAL. YOU’RE STILL TALKING TO ME, SOLDIER! NO. LISTEN - - HE FINDS HIMSELF WITHIN THOSE CHARACTERS AND HE EMBODIES THEM IN WAYS THAT JUST MAKE YOU LOSE YOURSELF IN THAT WORLD. SO HE’S REALLY HELPING THE DIRECTOR TO CREATE AND TRANSPORT BEYOND HIS OWN STATUS AND PRESENCE. TWO THINGS THAT AGGRAVATE ME. BEING IGNORED AND BEING LIED TO. I NEVER LIED. YOU TOLD ME THINGS WOULD BE FINE. THEY’RE NOT. I TRUSTED YOU. SORRY ABOUT THAT. I DON’T NEED PITY. I NEED A PAYCHECK AND I’VE LOOKED, BUT WHEN YOU SPEND THE PAST SIX YEARS RAISING BABIES IT’S REAL HARD TO GET SOMEONE TO PAID YOU. AM I TALKING TO FAST FOR YOU? AND JULIA ROBERTS PLAYING A CHARACTER ABOUT GATHERING UP CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AGAINST POISONING WATER IN A COMMUNITY AND LYING ABOUT IT. YOU GOT TO PROMISE ME WE’RE GOING TO GET THEM. TO GET TO BE IN THE ORBIT OF STEVEN SODERBERGH AND JUST FEELING LIKE YOU HAD FOUND YOUR PERSON, LIKE, WE JUST CAME TOGETHER AT THE RIGHT TIME WITH THE RIGHT MATERIAL, AND ONE OF HIS GREAT TALENTS IS CASTING PEOPLE. AARON ECKHART AND ALBERT FINNEY. YOU’RE ERRATIC. YOU SAY EVERY GODDAMN THING THAT COMES IN YOUR HEAD MAKE IT PERSONAL AND IT ISN’T. NOT PERSONAL. THAT IS MY WORK! MY SWEAT, MY TIME AWAY FROM MY KIDS. IT THAT’S NOT PERSONAL I DON’T KNOW WHAT IT - - A PERFORMANCE, SUPERB PERFORMANCE, YOU GOT ALL OF JULIA ROBERTS IN THIS FILM. AND THE OSCAR GOES TO - - JULIA ROBERTS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE OSCAR WHAT DOES IT MEAN? I DON’T KNOW. DO WE WANT THEM? OF COURSE WE DO. IT’S THIS GREAT PIECE OF RECOGNITION THAT WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME, AND IT’S A REALLY SPECIAL MOMENT. AH! I LOVE IT UP HERE! STEVEN SODERBERGH AND GEORGE CLOONEY SENT ME THE SCRIPT FOR "OCEAN’S 11" THAT CAME WAY 20 DOLLAR BILL AND SAID, WE HEAR YOU GET 20 A PICTURE. SO THEY WERE PAYING ME IN ADVANCE. [ LAUGHTER ] YOU’RE NOT WEARING YOUR RING. I SOLD IT. I DON’T HAVE A HUSBAND OR DIDN’T YOU GET THE PAPERS? MY LAST - - I TOLD YOU I’D WRITE. GEORGE CLOONEY IS THE ONE THAT CONVINCED HIS FRIENDS TO BE HIS FELLOW CAST MEMBERS, AND IT WAS JUST FUN. THERE’S SOMETHING VERY SPECIAL ABOUT SEEING THIS KIND OF STAR POWER, THIS CHARISMA ON-SCREEN. WHAT DID YOU GUYS GET? A GROUP RATE OR SOMETHING? STARS BECOME FOR A WHILE THE MOST DEPENDABLE ELEMENT IN MOVIES, WHICH IS WHY THEIR SALARIES GO UP AND ALSO CHANGES THE WHOLE CONTEXT OF MOVIES, BECAUSE THE POWER BALANCE IN MOVIES CHANGES. COME ON. I’M GOOD. IT CHANGES FROM AN INDUSTRY THAT AT FIRST WAS STUDIO DRIVEN AND THEN WAS DIRECTOR DRIVEN TO AN INDUSTRY THAT IS STAR DRIVEN. I HAVE - - BY CHANGING THE BALANCE IS CHANGES THE KIND OF MOVIES WE GET. ONES THAT ULTIMATELY CENTRALIZE THE STAR. ♪ "TRAINING DAY." SHOW YOU AROUND. YOU GET A TASTE OF THE BUSINESS. 38 CASES PENDING TRIAL. 250 ON THE LOG I CAN’T CLEAR. SUPERVISE I’VE OFFICERS. FIVE PROBLEMS, YOU CAN BE NUMBER SIX IF YOU ACT RIGHT. "TRAINING DAY" IS A SMALL FILM WITHOUT DENZEL’S PRESENCE. THE ENERGY HE BRINGS TO TA ALONZO CHARACTER MAKES HIM REALLY HARD TO TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF. 49, 998. SHOTS FIRED. OFFICER DOWN. REPEAT, OFFICER DOWN. 5951 BAXTER STREET. CONGRATULATIONS, SON. YOU’RE GOING TO GET A MEDAL OF VALOR FOR THIS I. DIDN’T SHOOT IT. THE COP SAID YOU DID, BUT I DIDN’T. YOU DID. EVERY SCENE THERE FROM THE FIRST DAY WAS THE REASON WHY I WANT TO MAKE MOVIES. I WAS JUST SO INTO WATCHING THESE TWO GUYS’ PERFORMANCE I FORGOT TO YELL CUT SOMETIMES AND THEY WOULD JUST KEEP GOING. PLAY THE PLAYER. I’M YOU’RES SHOOT ME. DON’T DO IT. DON’T DO TMPLTS NOW YOU - - YOU T HAVE IT IN YOU. DENZEL GOT IN A FIGHT, PUT THE CIGARETTE DOWN. THE SCENE WAS OVER. I SAW IT IN HIS EYES. THE LENS, A LONG LENS. I COULD SEE SOMETHING HAPPENING. HE WAS JUST ON FIRE, MAN. I’M THE MAN UP IN THIS PIECE! YOU AIN’T NEVER SEE THE LIGHT IF YOU DON’T THINK IT’S [ BLEEP ] - - I RUN SHIT HERE! YOU JUST LIVE HERE! YEAH. NATS RIGHT. YOU BETTER WALK AWAY. GO ON. WALK AWE WAY, BECAUSE I’M GOING TO BURN THIS MOTHER [ BLEEP ] DOWN! KING KONG AIN’T GOT SHIT ON ME! DENZEL IS A GIFT TO US. WATCHING HIM IN THE MOVIE, ONE OF MY JOYS. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART I THANK YOU ALL. 40 YEARS I’VE BEEN CHASING SYDNEY FINALLY GIVE IT TO ME. WHAT THEY DO? GIVE IT TO HIM THE SAME NIGHT. THE 2002 ACADEMY AWARDS IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE YOU HAVE DENZEL WASHINGTON WINNING BEST ACTOR, HALLE BERRY WINNING FOR "MONSTER’S BALL" AND ALSO SIDNEY POITIER GET AK LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD. AND THE FIRST 73 YEARS OF HISTORY OF THE OSCARS ONLY ONE AFRICAN-AMERICAN HAD EVER BEEN NAMED BEST ACTOR OR ACTRESS AND NOW AFTER LAST NIGHT THE NUMBER IS THREE. [ APPLAUSE ] IT WAS JUST A GREAT MOMENT FOR BLACK ACTORS, FOR BLACK CINEMA, AND THE STRUGGLE. LOOK AT THIS. AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF CINDERELLAS AND THERE’S NO SLIPPER. GIVE YOU A HEART? ALL I HAD TO DO IS LISTEN. THAT’S WHAT BUDSTS YOU. I REALLY LOVED PLAYING ELAINE MILLER IN "ALMOST FAMOUS." BASICALLY IT WAS A LOVE LETTER TO HIS MOTHER. DON’T TAKE DRUGS. DON’T TAKE DRUGS! IT’S ABOUT MY CHILDHOOD GROWING UP IN FAMILY WHERE ROCK ’N’ ROLL WAS DEEPLY SUSPECT. HE WAS THRUST AS A YOUNG BOY INTO THIS WORLD OF ROCK STARS AND GROUPIES ON THE ROAD. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! SEEING THE FREEDOM AND THE HEARTBREAK THAT COMES ALONG WITH THAT FREEDOM WAS REALLY EXQUISITE. ♪ WILL I END UP WHERE I THINK ONLY GOD REALLY KNOWS ♪ THERE WERE TWO SCENES. PENNY LANE DANCING TO THE WIND, CAT STEVENS SONG. ON THE FLOOR OF THE EMPTY ARENA. THAT FELT LIKE THE SOUL OF THE MOVIE. ALSO, THE SCENE WHERE THEY’RE ON THE BUS SINGING "TINY DANCER" AS A WAY OF KIND OF BRINGING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER. ♪ HOLD ME CLOSER TINY DANCER I HAVE TO GO HOME. ♪ COUNT THE HEADLIGHTS ON THE HIGHWAY ♪ YOU ARE HOME. ♪ LAY ME DOWN WHAT I LOVE ABOUT CAMERON IS THAT HE IS A DEEPLY DEVOTED FAN OF FILM, AND THE BEST OF HIS FILMS ARE BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE STUDIED THEM AND THE LOVE THAT HE HAS FOR THE CRAFT. AND I THINK "ALMOST FAMOUS" IS HIS BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT. ♪ THERE WAS A BOY A VERY STRANGE ENCHANTED BOY ♪ AWESOME. AWESOME MOVIE. EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT MOVIE’S PERFECT. ♪ AT TIME WHERE "MOULIN ROUGE" CAME OUT NOBODY WANTED TO MAYBE MUSICALS. IT WAS SUCH A TRAILBLAZER AS FAR AS HOW MUSICALS WERE SHOT.

PROVE IT. WHERE ARE THE OTHERS? EAT ME. FILMMAKERS FIGURED OUT YOU CAN BROADEN THE AUDIENCE FROM 3 TO 80. NO ONE’S LEFT OUT. I’M TELLING YOU, BIG DAETD, YOU’RE GOING TO BE SEEING THIS FACE ON TV A LOT MORE OFTEN. REALLY? LIKE ON THE MOST WANTED? HA, HA. YOU’VE BEEN JEALOUS OF MY GOOD LOOKS SINCE THE FOURTH GRADE, PAL. HAVE A GOOD DAY, SWEETIE. YOU TOO, HON. I’M THE DUDE THAT PUT OUT "TOY STORY." WHEN THEY CALLED ABOUT THE NEXT ONE I SAID, I’LL DO IT. I COULD HEAR THE LAUGHTER ON THE OTHER SIDE. HEY, THANKS A LOT. I’LL BE HERE ALL WEEK. TIP YOUR WAITRESSES! PIXAR FILMS ARE EXCEPTIONALLY EXIST KATED NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF VISUALS WERE UT IN TERMS OF SCRIPT, HUMOR, IN TERMS OF CHARACTERIZATION. NO ONE DOES IT AS GOOD AS PIXAR. THEY WORK MIRACLES ALMOST EVERY TIME OUT. "THE INCREDIBLES" PIXAR’S PG RATED COMPUTER ANIMATED FILM AND AT THE TIME CONSIDERED KIND OF A RICKY THING. RISKY THING. IT’S AN ACTION BE FILM BUT PEOPLE ASSUME BECAUSE IT’S ANIMATED IT’S A CERTAIN KIND OF FILM, AND THAT TELLS ME THE MEDIUM NEEDS TO BUST OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AH! BRAD’S CHARACTERS ARE REAL AND ACCESSIBLE, AND I THINK THAT WAS NEW. WITH "THE INCREDIBLES." IT WAS THE POLL ARITY OF WHAT’S MUNDANE AND THEY SLAMMED UP AGAINST EACH OTHER MTS TRACTION AVENUE. TAKE ME DOWNTOWN. TAKE 70. DON’T I? DON’T TAKE IT! PIXAR IS THE BEST BECAUSE THEY WILL DARE TO BE REALLY REAL. LOOK AT THE OPENING OF "UP." IT’S A BEAUTIFULLY POETIC SEQUENCE AND SETS THE TABLE FOR THE MOVIE TO COME. IT BEGINS VERY CHEERFULLY AND THEN GOES SOMEWHERE INCREDIBLY SAD. THAT CAPTURING OF THAT RELATIONSHIP FROM YOU KNOW, BEGINNING TO END, IT GETS EVERYTHING. IT MAKES YOU CRY. AND IT GIVES YOU THE SENSE OF LOSS IN A WAY THAT’S SO POWERFUL. AND THIS IS THE OPENING OF THE MOVIE. I WAS COMING IN HERE TO LAUGH, BUT YOU JUST ROCKED ME BEFORE IT EVEN STARTED. AND YOU GO - - WHAT BALLS. This bloom-ified menu starts at $13.99.opport? DO YOU LIVE HERE? LOOK, MISTER, I’M DIALING 911 AND YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE. GIVE ME THE PHONE. I DON’T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND. I’M A FRIEND OF YOUR DAUGHTER’S. YOU WANDER IN HERE HIGH ON EX- ECSTASY. NANCY MEYERS INVENTED A KIND OF FILMMAKING THAT IS GLOSSY, THAT’S FUN, THAT’S ROMANTIC, AND THAT ACKNOWLEDGES - - AH! THE LIVES OF THE WOMEN WHO ARE WATCHING THE MOVIES. WHY IS IT THAT YOU BROADS WANT ALL OR NOTHING? I DON’T KNOW. WE’RE JUST GOOFY WHEN IT COMES TO LOVE. MOVIES ARE FANTASIES MOVIES. JUST THE FANTASIES OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. SOMEONE’S HAVING A PARTY TONIGHT. USUALLY WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE AND THEIR FANTASIES ARE ONES WE DON’T OFTEN GET TO SEE ON THE BIG SCREEN. NO! YOU’RE NOT. OH, YES I AM. I AM HAVING AN AFFAIR, AGNES ADLER’S HUSBAND. OH! AH! YOU HAVE TRADITIONALLY MASCULINE MALES WHO LISTEN AND LEARN FROM THEIR FEMALE COUNTERPARTS. SEE? TOO MUCH. OKAY. GOOD ENOUGH. THAT’S AN IRRESISTIBLE MESSAGE TO THE FEMALE AUDIENCE. ON MY WEDDING NIGHT, TULA, MY MOTHER, SHE SAID TO ME, GREEK WOMAN, WE MAY BE LAMBS IN THE KITCHEN, BUT WE ARE TIGERS IN THE BEDROOM. OOH. PLEASE LET THAT BE THE END OF YOUR SPEECH. WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? WHY ISN’T ANYBODY READY? THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS HERE. AND "MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING" I GREW UP SO SURROUNDED BY LOVE AND PRNS AND AUNTS WITH MISS MUSTACHES TELLING ME WHEN TO GET MARRIED AND WHEN TO HAVE A BABY AND THEN I REALIZED I COULD WRITE A STORY ABOUT T. I’M GOOD. SMACK YOU LIKE A CHICKEN! I THOUGHT WE WOULD BE SHOWN IN GREEK CHURCH BASEMENTS AND THEN I COULDN’T BELIEVE WE GOT RELEASED IN THEATERS. EVERYONE, THIS IS IAN. IAN! THEY’RE CALLING IT THE LITTLE MOVIE THAT COULD. "MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING" HAS BEEN A BIG, FAT HIT AT THE BOX OFFICE THIS SUMMER. OMA! THE TOP GROSSING ROMANTIC COMEDY AND INDEPENDENT FILM OF ALL-TIME. OH! YOU SO BEAUTIFUL! SHE WAS ABLE IT TURN HER CHARMING ONE-WOMAN SHOW INTO A GLOBAL PHENOMENON. I MEAN, WHAT’S NOT TO ASPIRE TO IF YOU WRITE ROMANTIC COMEDIES AND MOVIES ABOUT WOMEN? A SECRET? I’M TRYING TO ORGANIZE A PRISON BREAK. I’M LOOKING FOR, LIKE, AN ACCOMPLICE. WE’D HAVE TO FIRST - - GET OUT OF THIS BAR. THEN GO TO THE HOTEL AND THEN THE CITY AND THEN THE COUNTRY. ARE YOU IN OR ARE YOU OUT? I’M IN. "LOST IN TRANSLATION" AFTER THE "VIRGIN SUICIDES" IT’S BEAUTIFUL. "LOST IN TRANSLATION" SHE TELLS THE STORY THAT IS SO DISTILLED AND PERSONAL AND UNIVERSAL AT THE SAME TIME OF THE LONELY WOMAN MISSING HER HUSBAND IN THE HOTEL AND THIS EXTRAORDINARY FRIENDSHIP THAT SHE STRIKES UP WITH THE CHARACTER PLAYED BY BILL MURRAY. TIMES. MAKE IT CENTOURI TIME. CUTTO, CUTTO! A CLUE AS TO HIS DRAMATIC SIDE. YOU START SEEING THAT SIDE OF HIM MORE. HE IS PLAYING A CELEBRITY. PLAYING A WELL-KNOWN MOVIE ACTOR BUT ONE WHO IS SORT OF DEAD INSIDE. AND THE FRIENDSHIP SHE STRIKES UP WITH THIS YOUNGER WOMAN BRINGS HIM BACK TO LIFE, IN A WAY. I DON’T WANT TO LEAVE. SO DON’T. STAY HERE WITH ME. WE’LL START A JAZZ BAND. THAT MOVIE AND HIS PERFORMANCE IN PARTICULAR I WAS VERY RELIEVED TO SEE A COMEDIAN DOING THAT. WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET MORE OUT OF THE HUMAN BEING THAT IS A COMEDIAN, IT’S FASCINATING. MY NAME IS JOEL BEARISH, AND I’M HERE TO ERASE. JIM CARREY IS OUT OF HIS MIND. GREAT IN THAT FILM BECAUSE HE IS A GREAT COMEDIAN AND A GREAT STAR. HE HAS EVERY CONCEIVABLE TOOL ACTORS HAVE AND KNOWS HOW TO USE EACH ONE AT THEIR RIGHT LEVEL. WE’RE GOING OFF! CAN YOU HEAR ME? I DON’T WANT THIS ANYMORE. I WANT TO GO HOME! TO ME ONE OF THOSE WRITERS AT HIS STRONGEST WHEN WORKING WITH THE RIGHT DIRECTOR. HAD HE AND MICHELLE GET TOGETHER YOU REALLY SEE WHAT HE CAN DO. WHAT? THERE YOU ARE. "ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF A SPOTLESS MIND "AMAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT HOLLYWOOD. IT’S NOT ALWAYS THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. SOMETIMES SOMETHING SMART AND UNUSUAL CAN STAND OUT. I LOVE YOU. MAYBE IN MONTAUK. THAT’S A FILM THAT BLEEDS IN LOVE. THE NAIVETE OF BELIEVING IN LOVE AND AT THE END COMES TO A RESOLUTION MAYBE TRUE ROMANCE IS AGREEING THAT YOURS RELATIONSHIP’S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. JACK TWIST. YOUR FOLKS STOP IN ANIS? DELMAR. NICE TO KNOW YOU ANISE DELMAR. WHEN I FIRST READ THE STORY "BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN" I KNEW IT WAS POWERFUL. I FELT IT WOULD UP END MANY PEOPLE’S VIEW OF TWO YOUNG MEN BEING IN LOVE AND THE CONSTRAINTS AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. ONE-SHOT THING GOING ON HERE. IT’S NOBODY’S BUSINESS BUT OURS. YOU KNOW I AIN’T QUEER. ME NEITHER. A LOT OF THE GAY MOVIES UP TO THAT POINT WERE EITHER KIND OF CULT MOVIES THAT EXISTED IN THIS GAY UNIVERSE THAT MADE GAY PEOPLE SEEM WEIRD OR EVIL OR SUSPECT OR KINKY, AND "BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN" WAS ONE OF THE FIRST MOVIES THAT FELT LIKE A MAINSTREAM HOLLYWOOD ROMANCE. I’VE GOT TO GO. I WAS SO FRUSTRATED HE KEPT CALLING IT THE GAY COWBOY MOVIE. IT WAS NOT THAT. IT WAS A HAUNTING, BEAUTIFUL, TRAGIC LOVE STORY OF TWO MEN WHO ESSENTIALLY WERE JUST TRYING TO EXIST. IT’S HEARTBREAKING BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO THE END, BECAUSE YOU’RE ROOTING FOR THEM AND JACK SEEMS TO BE WILLING TO TRY IN A WAY THAT INNIS DELMAR JUST CAN’T. I WISH I KNEW HOW TO QUIT YOU. WHY DON’T YOU - - WHY DON’T YOU JUST LET ME BE. HUH? PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME. WHAT WAS THE THEME OF "BROKEBACK"? I SAID IT’S SUMMED UP IN ONE WORD AND THAT WORD IS COMPASSION. [ SOBBING ] WHATEVERS WERE I WANTED PEOPLE TO COME AWAY SAYING IT SHIFTED THEM, BUT THEY WEREN’T QUITE SURE HOW. I WANTED THEM TO BE DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT THE WAY I WAS AFFECTED BY IT. Parents have a way of imagining ♪ THERE WILL BE BLOOD IS MY FAVORITE P. T. ANDERSON FILM AND DEAD IN PLAIN VIEW PLAYED BY DANIEL DAY-LEWIS IS A FILM I CAN’T WASH OUT. NOT NUDGE SOAP TO WASH OFF THE MEMORY OF THAT CHARACTER. I THINK ONE OF AMERICA’S FINEST FILMMAKERS. ALL THE FILMS HE’S MADE BRING YOU INTO A WORLD THAT IS UNIQUE WITH CHARACTERS WHO ARE REPELLENT AND REALLY ATTRACTIVE ALL AT THE SAME TIME. YOU LOOK LIKE A FOOL. DON’T YOU? YES. YESSSSSSS. YES, YOU DO. WE ALREADY KNEW DANIEL DAY-LEWIS WA WAS A PHENOMENAL ACTOR BUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER, PRETTY PERFECT. THE GREAT THING WITH DANIEL ESPECIALLY IN THAT FILM IS THAT IT’S INTENSE, BUT IT’S ALSO REALLY FUN. IT’S MISCHIEVOUS FUN AND THAT WAS A GREAT PART FOR THAT KIND OF DEVILISH, MISCHIEVOUSNESS TO COME OUT. I DRINK YOUR MILK SHAKE! I DRINK IT UP! DON’T - - AH! WITH HIM, I SAW A PERSON WORKING ANOTHER WAY. ONCE HE WAS IN CHARACTER, AND PEOPLE ALWAYS SAID, WELL, STAY IN CHARACTER. MYTHOLOGY. IT’S EASIER. MAYBE NOT FOR THE ACTOR BUT EASIER FOR ME. IT’S NOT THE ACTOR. IT’S THIS CHARACTER. I’M TALKING TO BILL THE BUTCHER. SOMEBODY STEALS FROM ME I CUT OFF HIS HANDS. HE OFFENDS ME, I CUT OFF HIS THUMB. HE RISES AGAINST ME, I CUT OFF THIS HEAD, STICK IT ON A PIPE. RAISE IT HIGH UP SO ALL IN THE STREETS CAN SEE. THAT’S WHAT PRESERVES THE ORDER OF THINGS. AND ONCE I SAW HIM WORK THAT WAY, THERE WAS AN INTENSITY THERE THAT WAS VERY DELICATE. I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU WILL PROCURE THE INDIANS. JUST A MIRACLE AS ABRAHAM LINCOLN. I’M HONORED HE FINALLY SAID YES AFTER MY PURSUING HIM TEN YEARS. DANIEL’S ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTORS WHO EVER ACTED IN FRONT OF A CAMERA. IT’S A MESS. AIN’T IT, SHERIFF? IT WILL DO UNTIL THE MESS GETS HERE. "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN" BASED ON A McCORPORAL ITH McCARTHY MOVIE. PLAYING A FREELANCE RANCH HAND FINDS A SUITCASE OF MONEY IN AN AFTERMATH OF A ROBBERY GONE WRONG. WHAT’S IN THE SUITCASE? MONEY. THAT WILL BE THE DAY. VISUALIZED IT AS A FILM. AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLABORATION BETWEEN A NOVELIST AND FILMMAKERS. IT’S JUST A BEAUTIFUL FILM FROM START TO FINISH. BUT IT’S THE WAY THEY WROTE THEIR VILLAIN THAT REALLY MAKES IT, I THINK, THE BEST MOVIE OF THE 21st CENTURY. I MEAN, I STILL THINK ABOUT HIM FLIPPING THE COIN AT THE GAS STATION. YOU KNOW WHAT DATE IS ON THIS COIN? NO. 1958. IT’S BEEN TRAVELING 22 YEARS TO GET HERE AND NOW IT’S HERE. AND IT’S EITHER HEADS OR TAILS, AND YOU HAVE TO SAY, CALL. IT LOOK, I NEED TO KNOW WHAT I STAND TO WIN? EVERYTHING. HOW THAT? YOU STAND TO WIN EVERYTHING. CALL IT. ALL RIGHT. HEADS, THEN. WELL DONE. THE COEN BROTHERS ARE INCREDIBLY EVOCATIVE BECAUSE THEIR PURPOSELY, I THINK, TRYING TO BUST UP THE NORM. THEIR "TRUE GRIT" AN ABSOLUTELY PERFECT MOTION PICTURE. RUNNING THEM CHEAP SHELLS ON ME AGAIN. I THOUGHT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY THE SUN WAS IN YOUR EYES. THAT IS, TO SAY YOUR EYE. YOU’VE GOT FILMMAKERS WHO BEGIN IN THE LATE ’80s OR ’90s JUST DETERMINED TO ALWAYS MAKE THE MOVIES THEY WANT TO MAKE. AS MUCH AS STUDIOS GAME CONTROL AND AS MUCH AS MONEY BECOMES A PART OF THE REALM, THE SPIRIT OF THE 1970s, THE IDEA THAT THE FILMMAKER COULD STILL BE THE ONE IN CHARGE WILL CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN ITSELF THROUGH THE WORK THAT THEY DO. ROYAL TENENBAUM BOUGHT THE HOUSE IN THE WINTER OF HIS 35th YEAR. THE MOVIE IS METICULOUSLY COMPOSED BEAUTIFULLY DESIGNED AND CURATED DOWN TO THE LAST DETAIL AND TEND TO TAKE PLACE IN A WORLD THAT’S ALMOST ABOVE ALL. THAT’S SORT OF SILOED OFF FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD. LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHY WOULD A REVIEW SAY THAT SOMEONE’S NOT A GENIUS? YOU THINK I’M ESPECIALLY NOT A GENIUS? I KNOW THAT - - YOU DIDN’T EVEN HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT. DID YOU? REAL ORIGINALITY AND FILMMAKERS IS PRETTY RARE AND I THINK LITERALLY WES HAD IT FROM INCEPTION. WHAT’S THIS LUMBER FOR? BUILD A TREEHOUSE. WHERE? FOR YOU. THERE’S A LEVEL OF INVENTION IN HIS STORIES THAT FEELS INCREDIBLY GENEROUS. YOU GO, WHERE DOES HE COME UP WITH THESE IDEA, THESE LONE DETAILS THAT FILL OUT THE UNIVERSE? ALMOST FEELS LIKE A COMPULSIVE QUALITY. COMPLEMENTS OF HERMAN. ASPIRING AND INTIMIDATING AS A SCREENWRITER BECAUSE IT’S SO RICH IN ITS INVENTION. EACH AND EVERY MANNED OWED ME 100 SCOUTS AND I WANT MY SCOUTS! AND ALL Y’ALL WILL GET ME 100 NAZI SCOUTS TAKEN FROM THE HEADS OF 100 DEAD NAZIS. OR YOU WILL DIE TRYING! NKWCONS NKWENTIITARIAN - - TA. THINGS SHOULDN’T LAND IT’S A CLEANLY AS THEY DO. TARANTINO IN THE 2000s IS GIVING US THE ENDING TO THE STORY WE WISH HIS RHISTORY HAD GIVEN UP. "INGLORIOUS BASTARDS," THE BAD GUYS IN HISTORY LOSE. ♪ WE HAVE A SINGULAR ABILITY TO WRITE MOVIES THAT WERE OFTEN VERY VIOLENT BUT THEY WERE ALSO RERCHING OLD MOVIES WHILE COMPLETELY RE-INVENTING THE FORM AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR AUDIENCES TO FIND THEM ACCESSIBLE AND ENTERTAINING, AND THAT’S REALLY HAZRD TO DO AND H DID IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HE CONTINUES TO DO IT. YO! YOU SON OF A - - [ EXPLOSION ] ♪ HE’S THE GUY WHO’S THE TALK OF THE TOWN ♪ WITH TRESTLESS ♪ ♪ GOOD LUCK. HARRY POTTER. WHEN HARRY POTTER CAME OUT, IT WAS RIGHT AFTER 9/11. AND PEOPLE NEEDED TO GO ESCAPE TO A WORLD OF WIZARDRY AND MAGIC. LOOK, LOOK. WELCOME TO HOGWARTS. THERE WAS TREMENDOUS ANTICIPATION FOR THIS FILM. AND, OF COURSE, WE MET WITH JOE ROLING AND WE WERE VERY CAREFUL TO RUN EVERYTHING BY HER AND TO BE SURE THAT WE HAD HER BLESSING BECAUSE SHE WASN’T SURE SHE WANTED TO HAVE THE MOVIES MADE AT ALL. I TOOK WARNER BROS. WORD THAT THEY WOULD BE VERY TRUE TO THE BOOK AND THEY HAVE BEEN SO I’M VERY HAPPY. HARRY POTTER IS THIS IDEA OF THIS YOUNG BOY WHO DOESN’T THINK NOT ONLY IS THERE NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT HIM BUT HE’S MISTREATED. THERE’S NO SUCH THING AS MAGIC. AND THEN TO FIND OUT YOU’RE ACTUALLY THE HEIR OF THIS AMAZING WIZARDING FAMILY AND YOU ARE UNIQUE AND SPECIAL AND HAVE A DESTINY IN FRONT OF YOU, THAT’S EVERY CHILD’S FANTASY. CURIOUS, VERY CURIOUS. THE HARRY POTTER FILM FRANCHISE LIKE THE BOOK FRANCHISE WAS SOMETHING THAT DEFINED A GENERATION. WELCOME HOME. THE DESIGN OF HOGWARTS, THAT WHOLE WORLD BUILDING OF THE MOVIES IS IMPRESSIVE, ESPECIALLY IN THE LATER MOVIES WHEN THEY STARTED TO HAVE A CONSISTENT DIRECTORIAL STYLE. THE IDEA AND THE MAGIC OF A WORLD LIKE THAT GIVES AN AUDIENCE COMFORT WHEN HAD HE SEE THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. FLYING. HARRY. IT CERTAINLY UNDERSCORED THE IMPORTANCE OF LITERARY PROPERTIES. IF YOU ARE FAITHFUL TO THE UNDERLYING SOURCE MATERIAL, THE AUDIENCES WILL EMBRACE IT. ♪ "LORD OF THE RINGS" IS ONE OF THOSE RARE EXAMPLES OF A FILM THAT WILL LIVES UP TO THE HYPE. AND LIVES UP TO IT THREE TIMES IN A ROW. ARE YOU FRIGHTENED? YES. NOT FRIGHTENED ENOUGH. I KNOW WHAT HAUNTS. YOU IT IS ONE OF THE CRAZYIST ACHIEVEMENTS OF MODERN FILM MAKE. THE INSANE GAMBLE TO MAKE THESE THREE EPIC, HUGE FANTASY FILMS ALL TOGETHER. YOU SHALL NOT PASS! PETER JACKSON INCREDIBLE VISIONARY, DIRECTOR IS IN CHARGE OF SEVEN SEPARATE FILM UNITS SHOOTING THE VARIOUS STORY LINES OR BATTLES. HOW HE KEPT ALL THAT TOGETHER IS UNBELIEVABLE. HE COULD WRITE ABOUT THESE AMAZING BATTLES AND THESE MAKES FAN TAS CAL WORLDS. AND WHAT JACKSON WAS ABLE TO DO WAS MAKE THAT SEEM REAL IN A WAY THAT YOU JUST HADN’T SEEN IN FANTASY FILMS BEFORE. WHEN I MET WITH PETER AND FRAN WALSH, THEY SAID LOOK, WE WANT AN ACTOR TO PLAY THE ROLE OF GOLAN SO THAT WHOEVER IS PLAYING FREDO AND SAM WILL NOT BE MAKING FOR GOLLUM. THEY SAID THERE’S HAD THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY CALLED MOTION CAPTURE. I FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. WHEN I FIRST STOOD IN FRONT OF THE MONITOR AND MOVE AS GOLLUM AND SEE THE ABTAR MOVING IN REALTIME WITH MY PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. YOU ARE NOT SO VERY DIFFERENT FROM A HOBBIT ONCE, WERE YOU? ? SMIGEL. WHAT DID YOU CALL ME? THE "LORD OF THE RINGS" TRILOGY IS THIS MARKER OF THE TOWELS. IT’S CHANGING TECHNOLOGY. IT’S INTRODUCING YOU TO ACTORS THAT NOW ARE HOUSEHOLD NAMES. AND IT’S AN EPIC THAT I OWN THE THING THAT WE’VE FELT IN CULTURE SINCE THE ORIGINAL "STARS WARS" FILMS. MASTER BUGGENS, I SUGGEST YOU KEEP UP. IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER ONE BOX OFFICE HIT FROM 2001 ON WARD, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF "AMERICAN SNIPER" IN 2014, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS A FRANCHISE FILM. WELCOME TO THE CARIBBEAN, LAD. THE STUDIO EXECUTIVES ARE SEEING THAT’S THE DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO. THEY’RE NOT LOOKING FOR A SINGLE PROJECT. THEY WANT NEXT FRANCHISE. THEY WANT SOMETHING THAT’S NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM ONE HIT FILM BUT IS GOING TO GIVE THEM A SERIES OF HIT FILMS THEY CAN THEN SPINOFF INTO A WHOLE WORLD OF ANCILLARY MARKETS AND TELEVISION AND VIDEO GAMES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I THINK WHAT PAUL GREEN DID IN THE BOURN FILMS WAS COMPLETELY REIMAGINE THE WAY THAT ACTION FILMS HAVE BEEN SHOT. HE JUST PUSHES THE BOUNDARIES. CAN YOU OPEN THE DOOR? ETHAN? I CAN’T GET ENOUGH OF THE "MISSION IMPOSSIBLE" FRANCHISE. THEY CLEARLY HAVE SUCH AMBITION TO MAKE EACH ONE BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE. I DON’T THINK THERE’S ANY QUESTION AT THIS POINT WE’RE GOING TO LOOK BACK ON THIS AS THE AGE OF FRANCHISES. EVEN COMEDIES GET FRANCHISES. FOUR MEN IN BLACK" MOVIES. THREE HANGER MOVIES. DOES THAT SOME STANDARD? ACTUALLY, IT CAME WITH A BLACK DUDE BUT HE KEPT GETTING PULLED OVER. THERE’S ALWAYS MORE CONTENT TO BE MADE. READY? STEADY. GO! CHERYL, IT’S CINDY. REMEMBER WHEN OLIVE WAS HERE LAST MONTH, SHE WAS RUNNER-UP IN THE REGIONAL LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE. THEY CALLED AND SAID THE GIRL WHO WON HAD TO FORFEIT HER CROWN. NOW SHE HAS A PLACE IN THE STATE CONTEST IN REDONDO BEACH. I WON. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE WAS THE FIRST SCRIPT THAT I WROTE WHERE I STARRED WITH THE ENDING AND REVERSE ENGINEERED THE REST OF THE STORY. MISS LOUISIANA. ONE DAY I’M SITTING AT HOME AND WATCHING TV AND THERE’S FOOTAGE OF A CHILD BEAUTY PAGEANT. THERE’S SKINNY BLONDE GIRLS WALKING AROUND.

HE HAS TO PRETEND HE IS THIS CHARACTER AND THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE IT. WE’RE ONLY HERE RIGHT NOW DOING THE WEATHER. THE SECOND HAD HE DON’T BELIEVE IT, THE SCENE’S OVER. THE BIG PART OF THE FUN OF THE MOVIE WAS WE WERE ROBBING BANKS COME MEEDCALLY. WHEN WE WERE DONE, THE GIDDINESS, THE EXHILARATION OF THAT EXPERIENCE WAS UNMATCHED. FRANK. HEY, HONEY. HEY. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING? WE’RE STREAKING. WE’RE GOING THROUGH THE QUAD TO THE GYMNASIUM. S WHO STREAKING? THERE’S MORE COMING. FRANK, GET IN THE CAR INTO EVERYBODY’S DOING IT. NOW. OKAY. JUST HEARING THE NAME PUTS A SMILE ON MY FACE. I REMEMBER HIM MAKING "OLD SCHOOL" AND V GOT THAT TASTE, OH YOU WANT TO SEE A GENIUS ON A MOVIE JEAN? HERE YOU GO. HERE’S WILL FERRELL. SORRY, I WANT RIDE WITH YOU THE REST OF THE WAY UP. THIS IS WHERE MY DAD, WOULD. FORGOT TO GIVE YOU A HUG. BECAUSE HE CAME FROM THE GROUND LINGS AND "SNL," HE’S AWARE OF WHERE THE LAUGHS ARE, WHAT THE RHYTHM OF THE SCENE IS. SANTA’S COMING TO TOWN. SANTA! MY GOD. HE COULD FLOW WITH A SCENE AND CHANGE IT. HE’S MORE LEAK A JAZZ MUSICIAN WHO IMPRO VIZ AROUND IT AS OPPOSED TO SOMEBODY MORE USED TO READING OFF SHEET MUSIC. LANE, COULD I PLEASE HAVE YOUR ATTENTION? I’VE JUST BEEN HANDED A URGENT AND HORRIFYING NEWS STORY. I NEED ALL OF YOU TO STOP WHAT YOU’RE DOING AND LISTEN. CANNONBALL. AND I LOVE ANCHOR MAN SO MUCH. AT THAT TIME, THIS WAS A BIG DEAL THAT HE WAS MAKING A MOVIE THAT WAS HIS AND ADAM MACKAY’S SENSE OF HUMOR WHO WERE BOTH "SNL" GUYS. IT WAS ALL THE GUFFY SHIT THAT HE DOES BEST ALL WRAPPED IN ONE. RON, WHERE ARE YOU? I’M IN A GLASS CASE OF EMOTION. HE’S GOT STONE ON. A LOT OF WHAT WE THINK OF NOW AS TOWELS COMEDY IS SOMEWHERE IN ANCHOR MAN, WHETHER YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT WRITERS, DIRECTORS, PRODUCERS, CO-STARS, CAM CAMEOS. BUT I THINK AND PA TAU IS DEFINITELY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN THAT FILM IN TERMS OF STEERING WHAT FILM COMEDY WOULD BECOME OVER THE YEARS. THANKS, MAN. SO READY? YEAH. OH! YOU [ BLEEP ] OH, I’M SORRY. I’M SORRY. THAT’S JUST YOUR JOB. I THINK JUDD APATOW CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE OF COMEDY IN THE 21st CENTURY COMPLETELY. I’M PREGNANT. WHAT? WHAT? I’M PREGNANT? WITH EMOTION? IT’S COMEDY INFUSED WITH THE HEART OF JIM BROOKS BUT WITH THE OUTRAGEOUSNESS THAT IS GOING TO KILL IT, IT’S GOING TO BRING THE HOUSE DOWN. ♪ ♪ I’LL TELL IT TO THE WORLD BRIDESMAIDS COMES OUT AND IT’S A REALLY SURREAL EXPERIENCE WATCHING THAT MOVIE. BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY FEEL AS THOUGH THESE ARE REAL WOMEN. OH, YOU HAD SEX WITH HIM. WE HAD AN ADULT SLEEPOVER. OH. DID YOU LET HIM SLEEPOVER IN YOUR MOUTH? ANNIE. I’M SORRY. YOU’RE UNBELIEVABLE. HE KEPT LIKE PUTTING IT NEAR MY FACE. THEY DO THAT, DON’T THEY. THEY DO THAT. LET US OFFER. WE DON’T OFFER. YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO SLAP IT AWAY. I COULDN’T. THAT SCENE WITH KRISTIN IN THE BEGINNING, I AM REALLY PROUD OF THAT ONE IN THAT I FEEL LIKE IT DOES CAPTURE THEIR CHEMISTRY AND YOU UNDERSTAND THEIR FRIENDSHIP SO QUICKLY IN THEIR FAMILIARITY WITH EACH OTHER. WHAT IS THAT? I GOT ENGAGED. WHAT? HE ASKED ME LAST NIGHT. WHAT. IT SHOWED FEMALE RELATIONSHIPS IN THEIR ENTIRETY, IN THEIR AWFUL UNATTRACTIVE SOME DAISY LOVE YOU EVEN THOUGH I HATE YOU SIDE OF FEMALE RELATIONSHIPS. AND IT REVOLUTIONIZED THE IDEA OF WHAT COULD BE FEE PAIL AND WHAT COULD BE FUNNY. YOU GOT FOOD POINTING FROM THAT STAUNT, DIDN’T. YOU NO, I HAD THE SAME THING THAT SHE HAD AND I FEEL FINE. OH, MY, OKAY, OKAY. NOTHING’S HAPPEN SMOOTH POOP SCENE WASN’T EVEN IN THE SCRIPT. MY GOD INTO NO, NOT THE BATHROOM. EVERYBODY GO OUTSIDE. I’M SERIOUS! AT REHEARSAL JUDD AND PAUL CAME UP WITH THE IDEA WHAT IF YOU GUYS EAT REALLY BAD FOOD AND GET THE SHITS. IT’S HAPPENING. IT’S HAPPENING. > UP TILL THAT POINT IT WAS VERY RARE TO SEE WOMEN BEING WOMEN IN HAIRED CORE COMEDY. THAT MOVIE IS UNPRECEDENTED BECAUSE OF IT. IT HAPPENED. IT HAPPENED. AND THINK HOW MANY PEOPLE’S CAREERS HAVE BEEN MADE BY THAT MOVIE. HEY, YOU WANT TO GET BACK IN THAT RESTROOM AND NOT REST. NO, I HAVE TO GET BACK TO MY SEAT. YOU’VE GOT TO GET BACK ON MY SEAT. MELISSA McCARTHY GOT AN OSCAR NOMINATION FOR THAT PART BECAUSE HE’S JUST SUCH A FORCE OF NATURE. HEY, HEY, GOOD NEWS. I FOUND HIS BALLS YEAR AND A CLEAR SACK. SHOVE THOSE BACK UP THERE. OH, MY GOD. MELISSA McCARTHY, SHE’S A GENIUS. SHE’S NOT JUST FUNNY. SHE CAN DO ANYTHING. I AM SO BAD ASS! NIGHT ON CNN. UP AHEAD WAS PANDORA. YOU GREW UP HEARING ABOUT IT BUT I NEVER FIGURED I’D BE GOING THERE. WITH AVITAR, JAMES CAMERON WANTS TO BRING BACK THE SPECTACLE OF A 3-D MOVIE AND IT’S GEARED TOWARDS THE THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE WHICH I FEEL LIKE IS PART OF JAMES CAMERON’S GENIUS IS HE WANTS TO MAKE A MOVIE THAT MAKES YOU HAVE TO SEE IT IN A THEATER. YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR FACES. STUDIOS WERE REALLY IN LOVE WITH PRE-EXISTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES. "AVATAR" WAS AN IDEA HE HAD BEEN RUMINATING ON FOR A LONG TIME. IT’S ORIGINAL AND THAT IS A WILDLY RICKY THING TO DO THAT THE BUDGET LEVEL. I REMEMBER TAKING MY THEN 9- YEAR-OLD SON TO SEE IT AND WE JUST SAT THERE IN 3-D AWE. TO BE SO IMMERSED IN THAT WORLD WAS MIND BLOWING. EVERYTHING FELT REAL. EVERYTHING FELD TANGIBLE. IT FELT LIKE THIS WORLD EXISTED. "AVATAR" CAME OUT AND BASEMENT HIGHEST GROSSING MOVIE OF ALL TIME FOR THE SECOND TIME IN JAMES CAMERON’S CAREER. AND IT’S INTERESTING THAT AT THE SAME TIME, JAMES CAMERON’S EX-WIFE KATHRYN BIGELOW DIRECT AID MOVIE THAT COULDN’T HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFERENT. IF EVERYTHING LOOKS OKAY WHEN I GET DOWN THERE I’M JUST GOING TO SET IT UP. GIVE THESE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT. WANT THEM TO KNOW IF THEY’RE GOING TO LEAVE A BOMB ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WE’RE JUST GOING TO BLOW UP THEIR [ BLEEP ] ROAD. IN MAKING "THE HURT LOCKER" WHAT KATHRYN BIGELOW DID WAS ESSENTIALLY MAKE A WAR FILM AS ASUS PENCE FILM. YOU SHIFTED THE PARAMETERS OF THE WAR FILM. YOU DON’T GET BIG BATTLE SEQUENCES. IT’S ONE PERSON GOING INTO THE REALM OF DANGER. AND BOY. KATHRYN BIGELOW IS JUST A MASTER OF BUILDING SUSPENSE. SHE IS TAKING THE VIOLENCE APART TO HAVE LOOK AT SOMETHING DEEPER. WHAT WOULD DRIVE THESE MEN TO WANT TO DISARM BOMBS AND HOW IT BECOMES AN ADDICTION. THIS IS SUICIDE, MAN. THAT’S WHAT I CALL A SOMEBODY BOMB, RIGHT? >>. CATHERINE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS. SHE IS INCREDIBLY INVENTIVE. INTREPID. NEVER RECKLESS BUT ALWAYS EXPERIMENTING. SHE IS A GREAT, GREAT FILM ARTIST. NOW IN OUR COUNT DOWN TO THE OSCARS, DIRECTOR KATHRYN BIGELOW HAS A CHANCE TO MAKE HOLLYWOOD HISTORY. SHE’S JUST THE FOURTH WOMAN EVER NOMINATED FOR BEST DIRECTOR AND SHE WOULD BE FIRST EVER TO WIN THE AWARD. AS WE’RE GETTING TOWARDS OSCAR SEASON WHERE THE BIG RIVAL IS JAMES CAMERON’S AVITAR," HER EX-HUSBAND HAS MADE THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, THERE’S THIS UNDERDOG QUALITY AND OBVIOUSLY THE MILESTONE QUALITY OF BIGELOW UP FOR BEST DIRECTOR THAT MAKES THE MOVIE KIND OF THIS UNSTOPPABLE FORCE. WELL, THE TIME HAS COME. CATHKATHRYN BIGELOW. WHOO. WHAT’S INTERESTING IS ABOUT HER IS SHE WAS VERY HAPPY FOR THE RECOGNITION FROM HER PEERS BUT THEN AGAIN, SHE DIDN’T WANT TO PIVOT AND BE THE POSTER WOMAN FOR WOMENING IN HOLLYWOOD. NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO CARRY THAT MANTLE. SHE ISN’T WEARING HER GENDER ON HER SLEEVE. SHE IS A FILMMAKER MAKING FILMS. SIGNED OVER EVERYTHING. IF HE DOESN’T SHOW AT TRIAL, SEE, THE WAY THE DEAL, WOULD IS YOU ALL ARE GOING TO LOSE THIS PLACE. GOT SOME PLACE TO GO? I’LL FIND HIM. GIRL, I’VE BEEN LOOKING. > I SAID, I’LL FIND HIM. THE STORIES I TELL FROM THE SOCIAL REALIST TRADITION, PATIENCE IS REQUIRED. WHEN IT WORKS, IT IS ABSOLUTELY WHERE I WANT TO BE WORKING. BECAUSE I DO WANT TO BE ABLE TO TELL STORIES FROM EVERYDAY LIFE. THAT’S THE PLACE WHERE ONE CAN DO THAT. JESUS. DAD’S YOUR ONLY BROTHER. YOU THINK I FORGOT THAT? HUH? COMING ON 40 YEARS, BUT I DON’T KNOW WHERE HE’S AT AND I AIN’T GOING TO GO AROUND ASKING OF AN HIM EITHER. WINTER’S BONE STILL STANDS AS ONE OF THE BEST INDIES AT THAT TIME. IT GETS THE GRAND JURY PRIZE AT SUNDANCE WHICH IS A GREAT HONOR AND IT GOT A LOT OF OSCAR NOMINATIONS. THE FILM HAD THIS REALLY COMPELLING PRESENCE AT ITS CENTER PLAYED BY JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND THIS IS THE BIRTH OF AN EXTRAORDINARY CAREER. I VOLUNTEER. I VOLUNTEER! I VOLUNTEER AS TRIBUTE. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A VOLUNTEER. JENNIFER LAWRENCE GOES FROM BEING THIS FRESH FACE IN WINTER’S BONE SOB BECOMING THE FACE OF A MASSIVE FRANCHISE IN THE HUCKER GAMES" MOVIES. THANK YOU. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THEN AN OSCAR DARLING WITH MOVIES LIKE "SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK." FORGET I OFFERED TO HELP YOU. FORGET THE ENTIRE [ BLEEP ] IDEA BECAUSE THAT MUST HAVE BEEN [ BLEEP ] BECAUSE I’M SO MUCH CRAZIER THAN. YOU KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. I’M JUST THE CRAZY SLUT WITH A DEAD HUSBAND. FORGET IT! SHUT UP. SHE WAS GREAT. I LOVE JENNIFER. HER CHARACTER WAS SO POWERFUL AND STRONG AND SHE HE DID IT SO WELL. I DIDN’T TRUST HER BEFORE BUT I GOT TO SAY NOW I DO. NOW YOU LIKE HER, DAD? I HAVE TO SAY I DO. YEAH. WHEN SHE WINS THE OSCAR FOR "SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK" IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE. SHE’S SNOT NOT JUST A FIGURE VERY MUCH IN THE TRADITION OF THE GREAT MOVIE STARS OF THE PAST BUT ALSO SOMEONE WHO IS WITTY AND REAL WHO IT SEEMS LIKE CAN DO ANYTHING SHE SETS OUT TO DO. THREE, TWO. SO WHERE ARE YOU? YOU’RE IN SOME HOTEL ROOM. YOU JUST WAKE UP AND YOU’RE IN A MOTEL ROOM. THERE’S THE KEY. IT FEELS LIKE MAYBE IT’S JUST THE FIRST TIME YOU’VE BEEN THERE, BUT PERHAPS. MEMENTO IS A FRACTURED NARRATIVE FILM NOIR ABOUT SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST THEIR MEMORY PLAYED BY GUY PIERCE. I LOST MY MEMORY. EVERY TIME I SEE YOU. IT’S A FAST FUN MOVIE THAT WAS AN INTRODUCTION TO A FILMMAKER WITH A ELLE OF A LOT OF TALENT. WITH CHRIS NOLAN, YOU SEE THIS GUY WHO IS HAVING A GREAT TIME MAKING A MOVIE AND SEEING WHAT HE CAN GET AWAY WITH. YOU SAID WE TALKED BEFORELE? I DON’T REMEMBER THAT. HE’S PLAYING WITH CHRONOLOGY AND NARRATIVE STRUCTURE BUT HE’S ALSO TELLING A REALLY TRAGIC STORY THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHARACTER WHO WE SYMPATHIZES WITH WHILE WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. I NEED A ROUTINE TO MAKE MY LIFE POSSIBLE. NO DRIVE TO NO REASON TO MAKE IT WORK. ME? YEAH, I GOT A REASON. I LOVE CHRIS’S FILMS. IT’S A RARIFIED AIR TO BE ABLE TO OCCUPY A PLACE WHERE YOU’RE CINEMATIC LITTLE AND POPULAR AT THE SAME TIME. IT’S ALWAYS RISKY TO BRING BACK A FILM AND TO MAKE YET ANOTHER STORY BUT CHRIS NOLAN CAME IN AND MET WITH ME AND WALKED ME THROUGH THE ENTIRE STORY. BEAT BY BEAT BY BEAT BY BEAT. AND I AGREED WITH IT IN THE ROOM. CHRISTOPHER NOLAN GAVE THE BATMAN STORY BOTH A MYTHICAL DIMENSION BUT ALSO A VERY GRITTY IN THE MOMENT KIND OF REALITY. WHAT? CHRIS NOLAN KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING IN CASTING CHRISTIAN BALE AND KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING BY MAKING IT A REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF BATMAN TO WHERE YOU COULD BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS HOW A BILLIONAIRE KID BECAME THE DARK KNIGHT. GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND GENT GENTLEMEN. WE ARE TONIGHT’S ENTERTAINMENT. IN THE DARK KNIGHT, HEATH LEDGER CHOSE TO PLAY THE JOKER AS A GENUINE PSYCHOPATH. HA, HA. IN A WAY THAT RAISED THE STAKES FOR THE ENTIRE PROPERTY. WE KNEW IT WAS OPEN FOR A FRESH INTERPRETATION AND I ALSO INSTANTLY KIND YOU HAVE HAD SOMETHING UP MY SLEEVE WHICH HAPPENED TO BE EXACTLY WHAT CHRIS WAS KIND OF LOOKING FOR. THE JOKER HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS CHARACTER. BUT WHAT HEATH LEDGER DID WAS MAKE HIM TRULY MALEVOLENT. I TOLD YOU I’M A MAN OF MY WORD. THERE’S A SCENE IN THE MOVIE WHERE THE JOKER HAS STOLEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HE JUST BURNS IT ALL. THAT’S MEANINGLESS TO HIM. HE WANTS TO CREATE CHAOS. ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. THIS TOWN DESERVES A BETTER CLASS OF CRIMINAL. I’M GOING TO GIVE IT TO THEM. HEATH LEDGER I THINK CHANGED HOW VILLAINS ARE PORTRAYED IN SUPERHERO MOVIES. HE SET THE BAR SO HIGH. IT’S A HEARTBREAKING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT REMINDS YOU OF WHAT THE NEXT 50 YEARS WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR THAT GUY AS AN ACTOR ON SCREEN. BECAUSE THEY LEGITIMIZE THEED THE SUPER HERO SO MUCH, THERE’S SO MUCH RUINOUS EFFECT THAT NOLAN PROBABLY DOESN’T SEE COMING WHERE STUDIOS ARE LIKE GREAT, THIS IS IT. THIS IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR BOX OFFICE STRATEGY FROM NOW ON. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION,. WHEN I WAS HIRED TO DO IRON MAN, I LIKED THE IDEA THAT IT WAS AN OLDER CHARACTER, THAT IT WASN’T SOMEBODY WHO HAD AN 0 OR GIN 0 STORY OF BEING AN ORDINARY PERSON AND BECOMING SUPER HUMAN. I’LL THROW ONE OF THESE IN WITH EVERY PURCHASE. IT WAS ABOUT SUICIDE SUCCESS IN LIFE WHO WAS HAVING A CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE. AND THE BIG THING THAT MADE IT ALL WORK WAS THE CASTING OF ROBERT DOWNEY JUNIOR. WHAT’S GOING ON HERE? I THINK WITHOUT HIM, WE WOULDN’T BE TALKING ABOUT HA MOVIE. LET’S FACE IT, THIS IS NOT THE WORST THING YOU’VE CAUGHT ME DOING. ANYBODY WHO WAS A ROBERT DOWNEY JUNIOR FAN OF WHICH I HAD BEEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, IT WAS A NO-BRAINER. YOU KNOW, JON FAVREAU IS AN EXCITING FILMMAKER. IRONMAN WAS AN EXCITING CHARACTER. EVERYTHING LINED UP. THEY GOT IT RIGHT. WHOO. OUR COLLABORATION ALONG WITH EVERYBODY WHO WORKED ON "IRONMAN" CREATED A TEMPLATE FOR THE TONE, THE SENSIBILITY AND THE WAY THAT THE MARVEL UNIVERSE COULD BE REFLECTED IN AN ACCURATE WAY TO WHAT STANLEY HAD COP UP WITH. THE IDEA OF SO MANY SUPER HEROES IN ONE MOVIE, THIS HAS NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. THE AVENGERS HAD THE BIGGEST U. S. OPENING EVER THIS WEEKEND. THE FIRST MOVIE TO MAKE MORE THAN $200 MILLION IN ONE WEEKEND ALONE. OUTSIDE OF THE ACTUAL ROYAL COMIC BOOK WHEREAS THEY DO THEIR WORLD BUILDING, I DON’T THINK THERE’S BEEN ANOTHER CINEMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT IS AS INTRICATELY WRITTEN AS THE MARVEL UNIVERSE. THEY’VE DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF THREADING THIS THROUGH HOW THESE GUYS HAVE EVOLVED EVEN WITH DIFFERENT DIRECTORS AND DIFFERENT WRITERS. DADDY, HELLO MOM. THE NEW STARDOM IS THE BRAND. MARVEL IS ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE HISTORY OF MOVIES. AND I WOULD TAKE THAT ARGUMENT AND SAY NOTHING COMES CLOSE. NO MOVIE STAR HAS EVER COME CLOSE TO BEING AS BIG AS MARVEL IS IN MOTION PICTURES TODAY. When the power of 472-horses to experience our most advanced safety technology LOOK AT THAT. THESE PEOPLE DON’T NOTE WHAT YOU’RE CAPABLE OF. I HAD BEEN A HUGE ADMIRER OF ALEJANDRO’S STUFF AND BIRD MAN WAS AS JOYOUS AN EXPERIENCE OF MAKING A FILM AS I EVER HOPE TO HAVE. I’M SORRY I’M SO POPULAR, MIKE. POPULAR? POPULARITY IS THEIR SLUTTY LITTLE COUSIN OF PRESTIGE. I DON’T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS. I DON’T KNOW WHAT WAS IN THE WATER AROUND MEXICO CITY, BUT ALEJANDRO ALPHONSO, GUILLERMO DEL TORO THAT IS A PACK OF TALENT UNLIKE ANYTHING IN MODERN FILM. OUR CREATIVE PROCESS IS A PROCESS WE REALLY SHARE BETWEEN EACH OTHER. DURING THE WRITING PROCESS, WE KEEP ON SHARING OUR SCREEN PLAYS AND BEING BRUTALLY HONEST WITH EACH OTHER. THEN DURING SHOOTING WE’RE LIKE SUPPORT GROUPS BECAUSE WE SUFFER SO MUCH THAT WE NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE WHO SUFFERS MORE. FLOOES THESE FILMMAKERS DON’T COME OUT OF A VOID. THEY COME OUT OF A COUNTRY WITH A RIN CINEMATIC TRADITION. SO THEY BRING A VERY SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE WHICH HAS EVOLVED OVER A LONG TIERED OF TIME. QUENTIN, MUCHO TIEMP PAN’S LABYRINTH TOOK PEOPLE BY STORM. IF THEY WEREN’T INTERESTED IN HORROR, THEY MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT GUILLERMO WAS DOING. IT BECOMES A REALLY ACCESSIBLE MAINSTREAM MOVIE THAT HE ALSO HAS THESE VERY DARK FANTASTIC CAL ELEMENTS THAT HE’S BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS. THE UNIVERSE MON CENTERS, OF COURSE, ARE SIN MAN HISTORY AND SO MUCH INSPIRATION FROM WHAT HE DOES COMES FROM THOSE OLD MOVIES. I CAN SEE THE LOVE OF THESE MONSTERS IN HIS FILMS AND YOU CAN HEAR WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT IT. I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT’S SPECIAL. AND SHAPE OF WATER IS LIKE CLEARLY HIS CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. GUILLERMO DEL TORO IS APPRECIATIVE OF THE OLD SCHOOL MOVIE MAKING. HE NEVER LOST THE 12-YEAR-OLD GEEKY FAN BOY WITHIN HIMSELF AND I THINK THAT’S WHY AUDIENCES CAN RELATE TO HIS WORK SO MUCH. WHAT YOU’RE SEEING IS THE DIRECTORS USING ESTABLISHED GENRES TO DO SOMETHING THAT’S ACTUALLY VERY IDIOSYNCRATIC AND THAT YOU CAN MAKE AN INTIMATE MOVIE WHICH IS ALSO A SPECTACLE MOVIE. ALPHONSO CARON IS GREAT DOING THAT. HE CAN MAKE A MOVIE ON ONE HAND LIKE "GRAVITY" WHICH IS SPECTACULAR THAT HAS TO BE SEEN ON THE BIG SCREEN BUT IN REALITY IS A VERY INTIMATE HUMAN MOVIE. I KNOW. WE’RE ALL GOING TO DIE. EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. BUT I’M GOING TO DIE TODAY. FUNNY THAT YOU DON’T HAVE TO KNOW, BUT THE THING IS THAT I’M STILL SCARED. I’M REALLY SCARED. ALPHONSO KAW RON IS A FASCINATING DIRECTOR BECAUSE HE’S SMART, GIFTED AND DOES ALL KINDS YOU HAVE FILMS. WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT "CHILDREN OF MEN" IS YOU HAD ALL THESE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS DYSTOPIAN FUTURE WITH SOMETHING REALLY HUMAN AT STAKE THIS IDEA OF FERTILITY AND CONTINUING THE SPECIES. PEOPLE FOUND IT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND RECOGNIZED WHAT A POWERFUL WORK IT WAS. AND NOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE BEST FILMS OF THE 2000s, IT’S ALWAYS IN THAT CONVERSATION. SHE’S PREGNANT. YEAH, I KNOW. IT’S A MIRACLE, ISN’T IT? WITH HIS LONG-TIME CINEMATOGRAPHER EMMANUEL LUBESKI, HE WAS ABLE TO DO THESE THINGS THAT NO ONE HAD DONE BEFORE. I WAS SPEAKING THE OTHER DAY WITH SOMEONE WHO IS AN INDUSTRY PROFESSIONAL AND HE HAD SAID HE AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HE KNEW DECIDED TO BECOME FILMMAKERS WHEN THEY SAW THE CAR SCENE IN "CHILDREN OF MEN." IT WAS LIKE DOING A SET PIECE. WE WERE REALLY DRIVING THE CAR. THERE WERE REALLY FIRES ON THE HILL. THE CAMERA WOULD MOVIE OVERHEAD. FOR US AS ACTORS, IT WAS EXCITING. THE CAMERA JUST MANAGES TO EFFORTLESSLY FLOW TO JUST WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. IT’S ONE OF THOSE SCENES THAT LEAVES YOU SAYING HOW THE HELL DID HE DO THAT. HE’S THE STORY TELLING THAT COMES FIRST AND THE CAMERA WORK COMES SECOND BUT THEY COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER SO BEAUTIFULLY. WHAT CAURON DOES IN THE REB NANTS" IS THEY UNDERSTAND FILM SHOULD ABEXPERIENTIAL MEDIUM. THAT YOU CAN FEEL LIKE YOU’RE IN SOME KIND OF HORRIBLE SURVIVAL STORY IN THE MIDST OF VERY RUGGED WILDERNESS. HE PULLS ON YOUR HEART STRINGS, PULLS YOUR HEART OUT AND KICKS YOU WHILE YOU’RE DOWN. YOU’RE GUTTED. YOU ARE GUTTED BY HIS FILMS BUT YOU CAN’T LOOK AWAY. JESUS CHRIST. WHAT HAPPENED? THEY ARE THESE EMOTIONAL PERSONAL FILMS THAT REALLY I THINK ENERGIZE FILM IN GENERAL. ALEJANDRO G., REVENANT. TONIGHT’S BIG WINNERS INCLUDED DIRECT KER ALEJANDRO FOR "THE REVENANT." HE WON LAST YEAR FOR BIRD MAN. IT’S THE FIRST TIME A DIRECTOR HAS WON BACK TO BACK OSCARS IN 66 YEARS. AL HAND DOE, GUILLERMO AND ALP ALPHONSO, THESE ARE THE MOVIES THAT ARE EXCITING PEOPLE AND MOVIE STORY TELLING FORWARD. THEY’VE WON BEST DIRECTOR FIVE OUT OF SIX YEARS RUNNING. WHICH CLEARLY MEANS THEY’RE MAKING A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE AMERICAN FILM INDUSTRY. I AM AN IMMIGRANT. LIKE AL PHONE AND ALEJANDRO LIKE SAL MARKS LIKE MANY, MANY OF YOU. I THINK THE GREATEST THINK OUR ART AND INDUSTRY GOSS IS TO REAS A THE LINES IN THE SAND. WE SHOULD CONTINUE DOING THAT WHEN THE WORLD TELLS TO US MAKE THEM DEEPER. "12 YEARS A SLAVE" IS THIS REALLY SOPHISTICATED REPRESENTATION OF SLAVERY WHICH HAD NOT ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE. THERE IS A VERY CHECKERED HISTORY OF THE REPRESENTATION OF SLAVERY IN CINEMA. AND THIS FILM I THINK GOT IT RIGHT. HELP ME. HELP ME. SOMEBODY, HELP ME. IT WAS BASED ON A TRUE STORY OF A FREE BLACK MAN WHO GETS KIDNAPPED AND PUT INTO SLAVERY. AND IT MADE PEOPLE SORT OF PAY ATTENTION IN A DIFFERENT KIND OF WAY. I AIN’T GOT NOST C COMFORT I THIS LIFE IF I CAN’T BUY MERCY FROM YOU, I’LL BEG IT. IT’S NOT THE EASIER FILM TO WATCH. THERE’S NO STEVE McQUEEN MOVIE IS. HE’S SUCH A GREAT DIRECTOR, PARTICULARLY IN HIS ABILITY TO PRESENT IT TO YOU IN THIS REALLY COLD REALITY. WHICH I THINK ULTIMATELY IS FRIGHTENING BUT THAT SPEAKS TO HOW COMPELLING A FILM STEVE McQUEEN IS ABLE TO CREATE IN TERMS OF SPEAKING TO THE HORRORS OF SLAVERY. IT’S RARE THAT AFRICAN-AMERICAN HISTORY BECOMES THE SUBJECT OF MAINSTREAM CINEMA. SO IT’S IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR ITS PERFORMANCES AND HOW WELL CRAFTED IT IS, BUT IS DRAWING OUR ATTENTION TO BLACK HISTORY. THE PRESIDENT DOESN’T WANT TO US MARCH TODAY. THE COURTS DON’T WANT US TO MARCH. BUT WE MUST MARCH. WE MUST STAND UP. WE MUST MAKE A MASSIVE DEMONSTRATION OF OUR MORAL CERTAINTY. THE REASON I THINK A VA VER NAY’S AN CLEANMENT IN "SELMA IS SO SPECIAL AND POWERFUL IS SHE WILL KNEW YOU COULD NOT TELL DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING’S STORY IN ITS ENTIRETY IN A TWO-HOUR MOTION PICTURE. YOU INSTEAD PICK A MOMENT IN THEIR LIVES THAT SPEAKS TO THE KIND OF PERSON THEY WERE. SELMA IT IS. SELMA DOES A REALLY GOOD JOB OF NOT ONLY HUMANIZING MARTIN LUTHER KING BUT REPRESENTING THE TENSION AROUND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT MAYBE GETS MISSED WHEN PEOPLE SAY JOHNSON SIGNED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT WHICH IS TRUE BUT IT WAS CONTENTIOUS. ♪ NOW YOU MASTERS OF WAR, YOU THAT BUILD ALL OF THE GUNS ♪ BLACK CINEMA ACTUALLY GOES IN CYCLES. I THINK IT’S GREAT THAT WE’RE HAVING THIS RESURGE GENCY BUT IT’S NOT THE FIRST TIME I’VE SEEN IT. AT WHAT POINT DO WE HAVE TO STOP SAYING THIS IS NOT A FLUKE. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THESE STORIES. HOW MANY FAST AND FURIOUS MOVIES, HOW MANY STRAIGHT OUT OF COMPTONS, WHEN DOES IT STOP BECOMING A TREND. THAT’S THE CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO SHIFT. MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT’S THE TYPES OF STORIES THAT ARE GETTING TOLD. GIVE ME YOUR HAND. LET YOUR HEAD REST IN MY HAND. RELAX. I GOT YOU, I PROMISE. I’M NOT GOING TO LET YOU GO. HEY, MAN, I GOT YOU. MOONLIGHT PUTS BARRY ON THE MAP AS A FAMOUS FILMMAKER. IT FOLLOWS THIS KIRK AS A CHILD, AS A TEENAGER AND THEN AS AN BULLET DEALING WITH WHAT IT MEANS TO BE BLACK AND GAY IN AMERICA. AND KNOWING HOW YOU HAVE TO OPERATE IN A WORLD THAT STILL DENY DENIGRATES YOU. WAITING FOR YOUR ASS. IT IS SO INTUITIVELY INTIMATE ABOUT THE CHARACTER. IT SAYS SO MUCH IN THE SUBTLEST WAYS AND THE LITTLE MOMENTS THAT SEEM TO BE FLEETING, BUT THEY BECOME PART OF THE BAGGAGE THAT YOU CARRY THROUGH YOUR ENTIRE LIFE. WHO GETS TO TELL THESE STORIES? THAT’S BECOME IMPORTANT. THERE’S A SENSE THAT YOU WANT WOMEN TO TELL WOMEN’S STORIES, YOU WANT PEOPLE OF COLOR TO BE ABLE TO TELL THEIR OWN STORIES. IT LITERALLY IS KIND OF CHANGING THE COMPLEXION OF HOLLYWOOD. HEY. . RYAN KUGLER FIRST GETS ATTENTION DOING "FRUIT VALLEY STATION," AND IT’S ABOUT THE POLICE INVOLVED SHOOTING OF A YOUNG BLACK MAN IN OAKLAND. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM? DID YOU KILL HIM? WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM? AS A RESIDENT OF THE BAY AREA, HE’S ABLE TO BRING A CERTAIN APPROACH AND A FOCUS TO THESE ISSUES BECAUSE IT’S LOCAL. BUT IT’S ALSO UNIVERSAL. RYAN KUGLER’S AMAZING BECAUSE YOU GO FROM THIS INTIMATE POWERFUL STORY BEAUTIFULLY TOLD. THEN REMEMBER THE WORD WAS GETTING AROUND THAT HE WANTED TO DO HIS OWN ROCKY MOVIE. ONE PUNCH AT A TIME, ONE ROUND AT A TIME, ONE ROUND AT A TIME. IN TAKING ON THAT STORY AND WRITING IT AND DIRECTING IT, RYAN MANAGED TO HONOR THE SPIRIT OF THE ROCKY MOVIES. IT’S FILLED WITH SOME OF THE BEST NIGHT SEQUENCES THAT I’VE EVER SEEN. THERE’S A PERFECT RIGHT-HAND SHOT BY BREED. THE LEAP THIS GUY’S MADE FROM THE CREED AND THEN HE ESCALATES IT AGAIN WITH "BLACK PANTHER." LET’S GO. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS, A FUNERAL? IT BECAME VERY APPARENT THAT THIS FILM WAS GOING TO BE A GAME-CHANGER. THIS APPETITE FOR THIS MOVIE WAS HUGE. THESE CHARACTERS, THIS FILM ATTRACTING A NEAR FRENZY AROUND THE COUNTRY. WE GET REPRESENTATION IN A FILM NOT ABOUT SLAVERY AND NOT ABOUT TRIALS BUT ABOUT A POWERFUL AFRICAN EMPIRE. WHEN YOU’RE SO THISTY FOR THIS TYPE OF REPRESENTATION, WHEN YOU FINALLY GET IT, YOU GLUT ON IT. MY UNCLE AND AUNT WHO I DON’T THINK HAVE BEEN TO THE MOVIE THEATER IN 20 YEARS WERE LIKE, WE’RE GOING. WAUCONDA FOREVER. Yeah. Switc Yeah? EICO. COME GIVE US A HUG BEFORE YOU GO. HUGS. COME ON, MOM. HUG HER. THAT’S WHAT SHE’S THERE FOR. AT THE TIME TO DEPICT A SAME-SEX COUPLE WITH A NORMAL THRIVING FAMILY WAS CONSIDERED - - WAS SHOCKING. I FELT LIKE I HAD A NUGGET OF SOMETHING I WAS REALLY INTERESTED IN. I BELIEVED IN IT. I DIDN’T KNOW REALLY WHAT IT WAS. IT WAS NOT FORMED. IT WAS JUST A CONCEPT OF THESE TWO WOMEN RAISING THESE KIDS WHO ARE BECOMING TEENAGERS AND NOW THEY CAN MEET THIS SPERM DONOR FATHER AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF - - I LOVE YOU GUYS, AND I LOVE YOUR MOM. AND THAT’S THE TRUTH. SOMETIMES YOU HURT THE ONES YOU LOVE THE MOST. I DON’T KNOW WHY. WHAT LISA DID SO BEAUTIFULLY AND TENDERLY WAS SHE BROUGHT SOMETHING TO POPULAR CULTURE THAT WAS WILDLY ENTERTAINING BUT REALLY ABOUT HOW ALL MARRIAGES AND ALL FAMILIES ARE VERY MUCH THE SAME. YOU SHOULD JUST GO TO CITY COLLEGE WITH YOUR WORK ETHIC. JUST GO TO CITY COLLEGE AND THEN TO JAIL AND THEN BACK TO CITY COLLEGE AND THEN MAYBE YOU WOULD LEARN TO PULL YOURSELF UP AND NOT EXPECT EVERYBODY TO DO EVERYTHING. AND THE FATHER, SON, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT. LADY BIRD IS THE FEATURE DEBUT. SHE WROTE AND DIRECTED IT. IT’S A SEMIAUTOBIOGRAPHICAL STORY ABOUT A YOUNG WOMAN COMING OF AGE IN LOVELY SACRAMENTO. A READING FROM THE BOOK OF GENESIS. NOT TO PUT TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON LADY GURWIG, BUT SHE’S THE HOPE. SHE’S BEEN THE RAY OF LIGHT FOR SO LONG AS AN ACTRESS AND WRITER, SO IT’S ONLY NATURAL SHE’S DIRECTING FILMS. YOU ARE SO INFURIATING. PLEASE STOP YELLING. I’M NOT YELLING. IT’S PERFECT. DO YOU LOVE IT? SHE’S A HUMANIST AND HER FILMS ARE SO FUNNY, AND THEY’RE CINEMATIC. ♪ IT’S A VERY QUINTESSENTIAL MOTHER/DAUGHTER STORY BUT ALSO FEELS VERY PERSONAL. HOW CAN THERE HAVEN’T BEEN MORE MOVIES LIKE THAT. THAT’S AN INTERESTING TIME OF LIFE FOR A LOT OF GIRLS AND IT’S BEEN IGNORED. ♪ BAKER IS A VERY INVENTIVE INDEPENDENT FILMMAKER. HE FIRST WAS ON MY RADAR SCREEN FOR HIS MOVIE TANGERINE WHICH HE SHOT ENTIRELY AN iPHONE AND CAPTURED WOMEN IN A TRANS COMMUNITY IN LOS ANGELES. THE WORLD CAN BE A CRUEL PLACE. YES, IT IS CRUEL. DON’T YOU THINK? I WANT TO TELL UNIVERSAL STORIES. I WANT TO TELL STORIES WITH UNIVERSAL THEMES. AS AN AUDIENCE MEMBER, I FEEL THE MOST SATISFIED WHEN A FILMMAKER HAS TAKEN ME TO A PLACE I’VE NEVER BEEN TO BEFORE. GET OUT, THE ULTIMATE HORROR MOVIE IN MY OPINION. WHAT IS THE GREATEST HORROR IN THIS COUNTRY? RACISM. NOW YOU HAVE "GET OUT" AND YOU HAVE AN INTERRACIAL COUPLE GOING TO MEET HER PARENTS FOR THE FIRST TIME. HOW LONG HAS THIS BEEN GOING ON, THIS - - THIS THING? TAKE THE IDEA OF YEARS OF AMERICAN RACISM AND THIS CONSTANT SENSE OF THE WIDER CULTURE STEALING FROM YOU, OF TAKING YOUR FOOD AND YOUR CULTURE AND YOUR MUSIC. AND YOU TAKE THAT TO SORT OF THE HORRIBLE, THE EXTREME, TO LITERALLY INHABITING YOU AND STEALING YOUR LITERAL BODY. NOW, SINK INTO THE FLOOR. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. SINK. I THINK "GET OUT" IS EFFECTIVE FOR ME ANYWAY BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IT WAS ABOUT. THEN WHEN I REALIZED WHAT IT WAS SAYING AND IT WAS SCARING ME WHILE IT WAS SAYING IT - - I THOUGHT IT WAS THE GREATEST DIRECTORIAL DEBUT I HAD SEEN IN SEVERAL YEARS. I MEAN, I TOLD YOU NOT TO GO IN THAT HOUSE. FINALLY WE ARE SEEING A LITTLE MORE DIVERSITY AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING THE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT MOVIES TO MAKE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE LITERALLY MAKING THE MOVIES. THEY ARE TELLING THEIR STORIES. THEY ARE TELLING STORIES THAT NO ONE IN HOLLYWOOD COULD TELL EXCEPT FOR THEM. AND THE MOVIES ARE GOING TO BE BETTER FOR IT. AUDIENCES ARE ALREADY UNDERSTANDING THAT. ♪ ♪ THERE IS STILL SOMETHING ABOUT BEING TOLD A STORY. A MOVIE IS SOMETHING THAT’S BEEN REALLY HAND-CRAFTED. IT’S A MOSAIC THAT’S BEEN CAREFULLY PIECED TOGETHER. IT JUST CREATES THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TOTALLY LOSE YOURSELF. IT’S A LITTLE BIT LIKE ENTERING A DREAM. IT’S LIGHT AND SHADOWS THROWN AGAINST A WALL AND BOUNCED BACK AT AUDIENCES THAT DON’T KNOW WHAT THEY’RE ABOUT TO RECEIVE. THESE IMAGES LIVE IN OUR CONSCIOUSNESS. THAT STAYS IN OUR MIND. THE WAY MUSIC IS RECALLED IN OUR HEADS, THOSE IMAGES REPLAY AND WE LIVE OUR LIVES BY THEM. IT BRINGS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF ALL OF OUR SENSES TOGETHER. THERE’S REALLY NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT. EVEN THOUGH YOU’RE DOING SOMETHING INCREDIBLY PERSONAL AND IN MANY WAYS INCREDIBLY SELFISH BECAUSE YOU’RE DOING SOMETHING YOU LOVE SO MUCH AND THEN IT GETS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD AND IT COULD CHANGE PEOPLES’ TRAJECTORIES. WHEN YOU CAN GO SOMEWHERE THAT YOU CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE YOU’RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SET YOUR WORRIES ASIDE FOR THAT PERIOD OF TIME, IT’S LIKE A DRUG. IT’S LIKE A DRUG. IT’S JUST A DIRECT CONDUIT STRAIGHT INTO YOUR SOUL. I GREW UP WANTING TO BE THE MOVIES. IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE MOVIES. SINCE THE DAWN OF MAN, WE LIKE TO GET AROUND A FIREPLACE AND COMMUNE IN STORY TOGETHER. SO, WE CAN FEEL FOR A FEW HOURS THAT WE’RE HUMAN TOGETHER.
