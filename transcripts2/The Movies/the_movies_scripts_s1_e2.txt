KIDS DON’T LIKE HIM. >> AS I KID, I LIVED THROUGH THE "QUIZ SHOW" PERIOD. I WANTED JOHN TO PLAY HERB STINTON, THE GUY FROM THE LOWER CLASS AREA AND HE ROSE TO FAME AND THEN CERTAIN PEOPLE WERE GETTING TIRED OF HIM BECAUSE HE WASN’T THAT PLEASANT TO LOOK AT BUT NO ONE COULD BEAT THE GUY. HE WAS SO SHARP. THAT’S WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH THE GUY WHY DON’T WE FIND SOMEBODY THAT LOOKS GOOD AND WE’LL GIVE HIM THE ANSWERS. >> GENERAL H. W. HALEK. >> YOU ARE OUR NEW CHAMPION. >> THAT CRUELTY WAS SOMETHING I WANTED TO SHOW. THE POWER OF MONEY AND PERSONALITY. SO TO ME THAT WAS A STORY THAT REALLY HAD TO BE TOLD. >> WE DIDN’T LAND ON PLYMOUTH ROCK. PLYMOUTH ROCK LANDED ON US. LANDED RIGHT ON TOP OF US. >> "MALCOLM X" IS SPIKE LEE’S EPIC. I THINK HE FELT A CERTAIN URGENCY IN MAKING IT. >> SPIKE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF CASTING DENZEL WASHINGTON AT THE PIN NABBING PINNACLE OF HIS MOVIE STARDOM. >> DENZEL WASHINGTON IS ONE OF THE ALL‐TIME GREATS. WHAT HE DOES IN HIS ARTISTRY PAINTING A PORTRAIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL, IT’S ASTOUNDING. >> IF THE SO‐CALLED NEGRO IN AMERICA WAS TRULY AN AMERICAN CITIZEN, WE WOULDN’T HAVE A RACIAL PROBLEM. IF THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WAS AUTHENTIC, WE WOULDN’T HAVE A RACIAL PROBLEM. >> WATCHING A GUY LIKE DENZEL AS MALCOLM X, TOP OF THE GAME, IRN INTIMIDATING IN MANY WAYS. >> WHEN WE MADE "PHILADELPHIA", HE WAS MALCOLM ALREADY. IT WAS LIKE STARTING A MOVIE WITH MARLON BRANDO AND JUST SEEING "THE GODFATHER" THE NIGHT BEFORE. >> WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE? >> I HAVE AIDS. >> "PHILADELPHIA" WAS AN IMPORTANT FILM. >> HOW DID THEY FIND YOU OUT HAVE THE AIDS? >> ONE OF THE PARTNERS NOTICED A LESION ON MY FOREHEAD. >> AS HIS CHARACTER SPENDS MORE TIME WITH TOM HANKS, HE STARTS TO SEE HIM AS MORE THAN HIS SEXUALITY OR HIS DISEASE. >> LET’S GET IT OUT OF THE CLASSROOM, BECAUSE THIS CASE IS NOT JUST ABOUT AIDS, IS IT? SO LET’S TALK ABOUT WHAT THIS CASE IS REALLY ALL ABOUT. THE GENERAL PUBLIC’S HATRED, OUR LOATHING, OUR FEAR OF HOMOSEXUALS. >> HE CAN BRING THE AUDIENCE ON THAT JOURNEY TO SAY WE DON’T NEED TO FEAR PEOPLE. WE DON’T NEED TO DESPISE OR STIGMA STIGMATIZE THEM. >>> MY NAME IS FOREST, FOREST GUMPF. >> IT’S A VERY RARE THING FOR ME TO READ A SCRIPT AND NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN. >> "FOREST GUMP" IS A MARVELOUS LOOK ON THE HOW HISTORY HAPPENS. IT’S A PLAY ON THE CONTINGENCY AND ACCIDENT THAT SHAPES OUR WORLD. >> WE WERE THE FIRST AMERICAN TO VISIT THE LAND OF CHINA IN LIKE A MILLION YEARS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SOMEBODY SAID WORLD PEACE WAS IN OUR HANDS. BUT ALL I DID WAS PLAY PING PONG. >> THAT FILM EMBODIES EVERYTHING THAT MAKES TOM GREAT. HE’S A FANTASTIC DRAMATIC ACTOR AND HE’S A MAGNIFICENT COMEDY ACTOR. I CAN’T THINK OF ANOTHER ACTOR LIVING OR DEAD WHO COULD HAVE EVER DONE THAT PART. >> BY THE 1990s, THE AGE OF THE PEOPLE WHO SERVED IN WORLD WAR II WAS 70. THEY WERE GROWING OLD AND DISAPPEARING. THERE WAS A POWERFUL SENSE OF NOSTALGIA. WE SAW A LOT OF RETROSPECTIVE LOOKS AT WORLD WAR II. THIS IS THE TIME WHEN PEOPLE STARTED TALKING ABOUT THE GREATEST GREATEST GENERATION. >> "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" WAS A FILM I WAS GOING TO MAKE SOME DAY IN MY LIFE. MY DAD USED TO HAVE HIS BAND OF BROTHERS FROM THE AIR CORP COME OVER TO THE HOUSE EVERY YEAR AND THE FIRST TIME I EVER HEARD GROWN MEN CRY WAS AT THE REUNIONS. IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE TRAUMA THEY HAD SUFFERED IN WORLD WAR II. >> WE’LL SEE YOU ON THE BEACH. >> I FELT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR ME TO TELL THE EXPERIENCE OF VETERANS AND WHAT TLAHEY HAD GON THROUGH WHEN THEY WERE A LITTLE OLDER THAN I WAS AT THE TIME. >> WHEN MOVIE GOERS SAW THE MEN DISEMBARK, THE BULLETS WERE GOING THROUGH THE WATER AND HITTING THEM IN THE WATER. THERE WAS A POWERFUL REALISM TO THAT. >> IT’S SPIELBERG SAYING WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE TO HAVE GONE ON THAT BEACH? YOUR NOSE IS PRESSED RIGHT INTO THE SAVAGERY. >> THE BEGINNING WAS FANTASTIC. I WAS ILL FOR TWO WEEKS WATCHING THAT. I COULDN’T BELIEVE HE DID THAT. >> SIR, I DON’T HAVE A GOOD FEELING ABOUT THIS ONE. >> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU FELT GOOD ABOUT ANYTHING? >> THIS ABILITY TO ENTERTAIN AND REACH AUDIENCES MORE THAN ONE WAY WITH THE SAME MOVIE, "SAVING PRIVATE RYAN" IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT. IT’S EXCITING, IT’S THRILLING, IT’S SUSPENSEFUL, BUT IT ALSO IS A REMINDER OF THE PRICE OF THAT KIND OF WARFARE, THE COST TO THE SOUL, AND WHO WINDS UP LIVING AND DYING AND BARING THOSE SCARS IN THAT KIND OF CONFLICT. >> I DARE GET YOU ONE, BUT THE MAN WHO MADE IT IS PROBABLY DEAD. I DON’T KNOW. >> MY FAMILY, WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, TALKED ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST, THOUGH THEY NEVER USED THAT WORD. THEY USED TO CALL IT THE GREAT MURDERS. I SHOT THE WHOLE FILM DOCUMENTARY STYLE. IT WAS THE FIRST FILM I HAD EVER SHOT LIKE THAT. IT BECAME LESS OF A FILM AND MORE OF A LIFE’S JOURNEY, A LIVING LEARNING EXPERIENCE MAKING THAT FILM. WE ALL FELT WE WERE SHOOTING IN A GRAVEYARD. AND SO THE AMOUNT OF REVERENCE OF THE CREW AND THE CAST, I LAST LIAM NEESON AT THE LAST MINUTE. I THOUGHT HE WAS THE BEST SCHINDLER I COULD POSSIBLY FIND AND HE WAS. >> OSCAR SCHINDLER WAS A DEAL MAKER AND HE DIDN’T CARE FOR HIS WORKERS, BUT THERE WAS AN ENCROACHING ON THE HOLOCAUST THAT UNLOCKED HIS EMPATHY. INSTEAD OF BEING SOMEONE THAT GATHERS WEALTH FOR HIS OWN PLEASURE, HE STARTED TO SPEND HIS MONEY TO SAVE LIVES. >> I COULD HAVE GOT MORE. I COULD HAVE GOT MORE. >> THE TOTALITY OF THE MEANING OF THAT FILM, THE FACT THAT IT CREATED AWARENESS IN THE WORLD ABOUT AN ERA IN HISTORY THAT HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN, IT DENIED THE DINNERS, IT ALLOWED US TO REALLY MEAN IT WHEN WE SAY NEVER AGAIN. IT IS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE I’VE EVER HAD AS A CHARACTER DRIVEN COMEDY. THE BILL MURRAY CHARACTER JUST KEEPS WAKING UP. >> HEY, PHIL. >> AND HAVING TO RELIVE THE SAME DAY. >> DON’T YOU TELL ME YOU DON’T REMEMBER ME, BECAUSE I SURE AS HECK REMEMBER YOU. >> NOT A CHANCE. >> USUALLY WHEN THERE’S SOME KIND OF STRANGE CONVENTION, IT’S EXPLAINED. >> PHIL CONNERS, I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU. >> YOU’RE IN A TIME MACHINE OR SOMEBODY CASTS A SPELL. BUT THIS JUST HAPPENED AND NOBODY MINDED. >> PHIL CONNERS. >> NED? >> NOBODY IS PERFECT. >> IT’S ALSO SO OBVIOUSLY FORBILL. >> BILL, LIKE THE GROUNDHOG BILL? >> YEAH, LIKE THE GROUNDHOG BILL. >> WATCH ON THE FOR YOUR SHADOW THERE, PAL. >> MORONS, YOUR BUS IS LEAVE. >> IT’S HARD TO BE A LIKEABLE DICK AND THEN WIN THE AUDIENCE OVER BY THE END. BILL IS REALLY GOOD AT THAT. >> THANK YOU, YOUNG MAN. >> IT’S NOTHING, MA’AM. I HAD THE TIRE AND THE JACK. JUST BE COMFORTABLE. ALL RIGHT? >> TO ME, BILL MURRAY IS ONE OF THE GREAT COMEDY ACTORS THAT HAS EVER BEEN. >> HOW LONG WILL YOU BE STAYING WITH US? >> INDEFINITELY. I’M BEING SUED FOR DIVORCE. >> HE’S PICKY, WHICH IS PERFECT BECAUSE THEN HE FINDS HIS WAY INTO SOMEBODY REALLY EXTRAORDINARY. >> WHAT’S THE SECRET, MAX? >> THE SECRET? >> YEAH. YOU SEEM TO HAVE IT PRETTY FIGURED OUT. >> THE SECRET? I DON’T HAVE ONE. I THINK YOU’VE JUST GOT TO FIND SOMETHING YOU LOVE TO DO AND THEN DO IT FOR THE WEST OF YOUR LIFE. >> WES ANDERSON, HIS FILMS ARE LIKE OPENING A JEWELRY BOX AND YOU CAN TAKE OUT ALL THE LITTLE TRINKETS AND THEY’RE SPARKLY AND JOYFUL. >> IT’S SO RARE WHEN SOMEONE COMES ALONG AND CREATES THEIR OWN AESTHETIC. >> WES IS TRULY UNIQUE. >> I REALLY RELATED TO HIM IN TERMS OF HAVING BAD GRADES AND NOT BEING GOOD IN SCHOOL, BUT HAVING LIKE A PASSION FOR SOMETHING. >> WHEN HE CAME OUT, I WROTE A FAN LETTER TO WES. IT WAS A PERFECT FILM, LAUGH OUT LOUD HUMOR. >> I LIKE YOUR NURSE’S UNIFORM. >> THESE ARE O. R. SCRUBS. >> OH, ARE THEY? >> COMEDY IN THE ’90s WILL BE GIGANTIC. >> SHALL WE SHALL NOW OR SHALL WE SHAG LATER? >> IT’S GOING TO BE OVER THE TOP AND IT’S GOING TO FILL THE FRAME. >> WHY DON’T YOU JUST GO HOME. THAT’S YOUR HOME. ARE YOU TOO GOOD FOR YOUR HOME? ANSWER ME! >> AND YOU’RE GOING TO GET ADAM SANDLER KNOCKING OUT ONE MOVIE AFTER THE NEXT. >> CINDY AND SCOTT ARE NEWLILY NEWLYWEDS. >> IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCENES THAT ARE MEMORABLE FROM "WAYNE’S WORLD" THEY’RE BIG SCENES. THEY’RE THE HEADS BOBBING BACK AND FORTH. THEY ARE NOT AFRAID TO DO SOMETHING BIG TO GET A LAUGH. >> AND THENALL OFA SUDDENONE DAY THIS GUY, WHO IS AS BIG AS THE SCREEN, SHOWS UP. AND IT’S JIM CAREY. AND HE TURNS INTO A TOP HOLLYWOOD STAR BECAUSE HE IS UNAFRAID TO BE BIG. EVEN AS HE IS DOING THESE OVER THE TOP THINGS WHERE YOU THINK WELL, HE’S TALKING THROUGH HIS BEHIND. I’M NOT GOING TO WATCH THIS. >> EXCUSE ME, I’D LIKE TO ASS YOU A FEW QUESTION. >> AND YET THERE YOU ARE WATCHING AND YOU’RE LAUGHING. INTELLECTUAL ABOUT IT. I JUST LAFUGHED MY ASS OFF. AND PART OF ME WAS, LIKE, I CAN’T BELIEVE THEY’RE DOING IT. >> WHAT’S THAT BUBBLE THERE? >> WHAT DO YOU THINK? >> HOW THE HELL DID THE GET THE BEANS ABOVE THE FRANK? >> THE FARLEY BROTHERS PUSHED THE RULES SO FAR THAT ‐‐ YOU CAN DO THAT? >> "SOMETHING ABOUT MARRYY" IS THIS COMEDY THAT HAS A HEART TO IT. >> MAYBE YOU SHOULD MOVE DOWN HERE AND MARY ME. >> I’LL HAVE A COFFEE. >> I’LL HAVE A CAP CHINO. >> DO YOU HAVE ANY COFFEE ICE CREAM? >> I’LL HAVE DE‐‐ >> YOU HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF REALLY FUNNY BANKABLE PEOPLE DOING WONDERFUL MOVIES. >> MY FIRST DAY AS A WOMAN AND I’M GETTING HOT FLASH. >> HELLO, PETER. >> WHAT’S HAPPENING? >> I’M GOING TO NEED YOU TO GO AHEAD AND COME IN TOMORROW. SO IF YOU CAN BE HERE AROUND 9:00, THAT WOULD BE GREAT. OKAY? >> "OFFICE SPACE" IS NOT AS ACCLAIMED AS IT SHOULD BE. IT WAS NOT A BIG HIT, BUT THERE’S SO MUCH MODERN COMEDY IN THAT MOVIE. IT WAS WONDERFUL. >> "OFFICE SPACE" DID SUCH A GREAT JOB IN COMPLETELY LAMPOONING OFFICE LIFE. TECHNOLOGY HAD MADE THESE CUBICAL LANDS AND "OFFICE SPACE" REALLY CAPTURED THAT. >> I’M THINKING I MIGHT TAKE THAT FROM LOGISTICS. THINGS GO WELL I’LL BE SHOWING THEM "O" THINGS. YOU BE WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT. >> JENNIFER ANISTON WAS IN IT. >> WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FLARE. >> WHEN YOU HAD THAT MANAGER THAT SAYS PUT THAT FLARE ON AND SHOW US WHAT YOU’RE REALLY LIKE. HERE’S MY FLARE. >> ALL RIGHT. THERE’S MY FLARE. OKAY? AND THIS IS ME EXPRESSING MYSELF. >> CHRISTOPHER GUEST IS CONSIDERED THE MASTER OF THE MOCKUMENTARY. HE COMES UP WITH CHARACTERS THAT ARE PROFOUNDLY SILLY. >> WHEN WE WERE ON "SNL" TOGETHER, CHRIS DID A MOVIE WITH MARTY AND HARRY CALLED SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING. >> I’VE BEEN DIRECTING THEATER, SHAKESPEARE IN THE PARK. >> THAT’S WHERE THE CHARACTER WAS SORT OF BORN. ME, YOU KNOW, RIGHT OUT OF THE NAVY FRESH OFF A DESTROYER WITH A DANCE BELT AND A TUBE OF CHAPSTICK BASICALLY. NOT MUCH TO CALL MY OWN AND BEING SLAMMED DOWN FOR 10 OR SO YEARS, OFF, OFF, OFF BROADWAY AND THEN ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. OKAY? I GET THE JOKE. >> CHRIS SURROUNDS HIMSELF WITH FUNNY PEOPLE, EUGENE, KATHERINE O’HARA. >> IF THERE IS AN EMPTY SPACE, SAY A LINE. >> CHRIS WORKS IN MINIATURE. HE’S LIKE PETER SELLERS. SUCH FINE TASTE. AND WHEN IT HITS RIGHT, IT’S AMAZING. >> AND THAT’S THE WAY IT IS? THEN I JUST HATE YOU AND I HATE YOUR ASS FACE. >>> I REMEMBER COMING OUT AND SEEING "DO THE RIGHT THING" THAT DAY I WENT TO MY DORM AND STARTED WRITING "BOYZ IN THE HOOD". >> BOTH OF MY BROTHERS HAVE BEEN SHOT AND THEY’RE STILL ALIVE. >> SOME OF WHAT I WAS DOING WAS BY WHAT I SAW ROB REINER DO WITH "STAND BY ME" BUT THEY DIDN’T SPEAK TO WHERE I WAS COMING FROM. >> WE GOT A CALL ON A BURGLARY HERE. >> THAT WAS ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. >> WE DIDN’T ASK YOU THAT. >> I DECIDED TO HAVE A BLACK COP BE MORE VEHEMENT THAN THE WHITE PARTNER. >> SOMETHING WRONG?

OH, YOU’RE SCARED NOW, HUH? I LIKE THAT. >> SINGLETON WAS NOMINATED FOR TWO ACADEMY AWARDS, BEST ORIGINAL SCREEN PLAY AND THE YOUNGEST PERSON EVER NOMINATED FOR BEST DIRECTOR. >> IT WAS AN ERA WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO BLACK FILM.

THERE STARTED TO BECOME A GENUINE INDEPENDENT FILM MOVEMENT. AND SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL AND INSTATUTE HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH IT. >> THE IDEA OF STARTING SUNDANCE WAS I FELT I HAD GROWN UP BEING A PART OF THE MAJOR FILM INDUSTRY BECAUSE THAT’S ALL THERE WAS. I WAS FORTUNATE TO BE PART OF THAT. AS TIME WENT ON, I BECAME MORE AWARE OF OTHER STORIES THAT COULD BE TOLD. THEY WOULD BE TOLD BY PEOPLE LESS INCLINED TO BE COMMERCIALLY ATTRACTIVE. THEY WERE DIFFERENT. THEY WERE OFFBEAT BUT THEY WERE STORIES THAT I FELT SHOULD BE TOLD. >> WOMEN ARE LONELY IN THE ’90s. IT’S OUR NEW PHASE. WE’LL LIVE. >> THEY WEREN’T LOOKING AT WHO MADE THE MOVIES. THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE MOVIES. THEY HAVE A COMMITMENT TO SHOWING FILMS WITH VERY SPECIFIC AUTHENTIC VOICES. >> THERE WAS A SUDDEN RECOGNITION BECAUSE OF THE SUCCESS OF FILMS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT FESTIVAL AND IT DROVE SUCH A PROFOUND CHANGE INTO MAIN LINE HOLLYWOOD. >> SAY, MAN, YOU GOT A JOINT? >> NO, NOT ON ME, MAN. >> IT WOULD BE A LOT COOLER IF YOU DID. >> JUST LIKE AMERICAN GRAFFITI, DAZED AND CONFUSED WAS THIS COMPLETE EUPHORIC LOOK AT YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE THEY HAVE TO BECOME ADULTS. >> THERE’S OTHER HIGH SCHOOL MOVIES.

IT WAS LIKE A TARANTULA ON THE DOORSTEP. YOU HAD TO LOOK AT IT, MY GOD, LOOK AT THE SIZE OF THIS THING. >> YOU HAVE TO FORGET IT. >> TRYING TO FORGET ANYTHING AS INTRIGUING AS THIS COULD BE AN EXERCISE IN FUTILITY. >> LOOK AT WHAT JOHN TRAVOLTA DOES. LOOK AT UMA THURMAN BRUCE WILLIS. IT WAS SLICK. IT WAS FAST. IT HAD NO CONVENTION TO IT WHATSOEVER. IT JUST REWROTE THE RULES OF THE WAY YOU CAN MAKE FILM. >> DIE! >> YOU CONSTANTLY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE HAVE YOU ALL THESE CHARACTERS WHO WERE SOMEHOW CONNECTED AND YOU ONLY START TO FIGURE THAT OUT AS THE MOVIE GOES ON. >> I LOVE YOU, PUMPKIN. >> I LOVE YOU HONEY BUNNY. >> EVERYBODY THIS IS A ROBBERY. >> YOU KNOW A TARANTINO FILM THE MINUTE YOU SEE IT. IT’S SUCH A FANFARE OF A NEW KIND OF FILMMAKER. KIND OF COCKTAIL 50s NOSTALGIA CULTURE IN L. A. THAT PEOPLE WHO MADE THE MOVIE WERE PART OF. AND IT KIND OF BECAME A PHENOMENON. >> SO, WHAT DO YOU GUYS DO. >> WELL, I’M A COMEDIAN. >> WHEN I STARRED WRITING "SWINGERS," I DIDN’T KNOW THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A MOVIE OR A IF YOU SCRIPT. I WAS JUST WRITING STUFF THAT I GOT A KICK OF AND KEPT GOING WITH IT. >> WHEN YOU TALK TO A MAN I DON’T WANT YOU TO BE THE GUY IN THE PG13. I WANT YOU TO BE LIKE THE GUY IN THE RATED R MOVIE, YOU’RE NOT SURE WHETHER YOU LIKE YET, YOU’RE NOT SURE WHERE HE’S COMING FROM. YOU’RE A BAD MAN, YOU’RE A BAD MAN. BAD MANN MAN. >> IT WAS SORT OF THAT INDIE COMEDY SENSIBILITY. WE WERE INFLUENCED BY KEVIN SMITH AND TARANTINO AND SCORSESE. WHEN THE MOVIE FINALLY CAME OUT IT, HIT THE CULTURE IN A BIG WAY. >> SEE, BABY, IT’S NOT THAT HARD. >> 3310. >>> ANIMATION WAS DISNEY’S BRAND, BUT IN THE EARLY ’80s, THEY WERE REAL ADRIFT AND LITTLE MERMAID WAS THE HIT THAT SHOWED >> AND THAT KICKED OFF A TOTAL REVOLUTION IN THE ANIMATION WORLD. >> AND NOW, WE INVITE TO YOU RELAX, LET US PULL UP A CHAIR AS THE DINING RORM PROUDLY PRESENTS ‐‐ YOUR DINNER. >> WHEN AUDIENCES SEE THESE MOVIES THEY HAVEN’T SEEN ANIMATION LIKE THIS IN DECADES. >> THE DISNEY STUDIO RE‐EXAMINES THE TEMPLATES OF SNOW WHITE, PINOCCHIO, DUMBO, BAMBI. AND IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT, RETURNS THE DISNEY ANIMATION TO ITS FUNDAMENTALS. 10,000 YEARS WILL GIVE YOU SUCH A CRICK IN THE NECK. >> AND BECAUSE THEY’RE DONE WITH CLEVERNESS AND WITH GREAT USE OF MUSIC WHICH DISNEY SPECIALIZED IN, THEY CAPTURE THE SAME MAGIC. INTERESTING BECAUSE IT’S A VERY OLD TALE THAT’S BEEN RETOLD IN DIFFERENT WAYS. BUT IT EMERGED AS SOMETHING SPECIAL AND I THINK BECAME BIGGER THAN THE SUM OF ITS >> IT JUST CLICKED WITH THE RIGHT ANIMATORS, THE RIGHT KIND OF STORY OF THAT KIND OF EPIC SCALE. AND THAT YOU CAN SEE THE BEGINNINGS OF CG IN THE BACKGROUND FOR CERTAIN THINGS LIKE THE STAMPEDE. IT’S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE IF THE STARS ALIGN AND IT HITS THE CULTURE IN A WAY THAT’S IMPACTFUL. I REMEMBER GOING TO SEE TOY STORY" AND SAW IT TWICE. >> THERE SEEMS TO BE NO SIGN OF INTELLIGENT LIFE ANYWHERE. >> HELLO. >> THE COMEDY WASN’T TALKING DOWN TO KIDS. IT WAS FOR EVERYBODY. >> LOOK, WE’RE ALL VERY IMPRESSED WITH ANDY’S NEW TOY. >> TOY? T‐O‐Y‐. TOY. >> EXCUSE ME, I THINK THE WORD YOU’RE SEARCHING FOR IS SPACE RANGER. >> THE WORD I’M SEARCHING FOR I CAN’T SAY BECAUSE THERE’S PRESCHOOL TOYS PRESENT. >> GETTING KIND OF TENSE, AREN’T YOU? >> WHEN I SAW TOY STORY," I WAS BLOWN AWAY. >> IMPRESSIVE WINGSPAN.

AND IT WAS DONE WITH ALL OF THE SINCERITY OF THE WALT ERA. >> YOU ACTUALLY THINK YOU’RE THE BUZZ LIGHTYEAR? OH, ALL THIS TIME I THOUGHT IT WAS AN ACT. HEY, GUYS, LOOK. IT’S THE REAL BUZZ LIGHTYEAR. >> YOU’RE MOCKING ME, AREN’T YOU? >> ANYBODY WANTING TO STUDY SCREEN WRITING SHOULD WATCH PIXAR MOVIES. I JUST THINK THEY’RE BEAUTIFULLY, BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. >> WELL, IF YOU KNEW HIM, YOU’D UNDERSTAND. YOU SEE ANDY’S. >> LET ME GUESS. ANDY’S A REAL SPECIAL KID. AND TO HIM YOU’RE HIS BUDDY’S BEST FRIEND AND WHEN ANDY PLAYS WITH YOU, IT’S LIKE EVEN THOUGH YOU’RE NOT MOVING, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU’RE ALIVE. BECAUSE THAT’S HOW HE SEES YOU. >> YOU ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THESE CHARACTERS HAD AN INTERNAL LIFE. THEY FELT LIKE BEING A TOY WAS A JOB THAT THEY WERE PROUD OF. THAT WAS JUST A BRILLIANT PREMISE. AND IT WAS EXECUTED PERFECTLY. BEAUTIFUL ABOUT BRINGING AN INANIMATE ON THE TO LIFE. DRAWING ANIMATION IS THE SAME KIND OF THING. THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT STOP MOTION THAT’S SO STRONGING. > WHAT’S THEY? THERE’S WIPINGS IN THE AIR. WHAT’S THIS I CAN’T BELIEVE MY EYES I MUST BE DREAMING, WAKEUP, JACK, THIS ISN’T FAIR. >> TIM BURTON HAS MANAGED TO TAKE THE MOST MACABRE THINGS AND MAKE THEM SO FUN AND SO HEART BREAKING AND BEAUTIFUL, NO ONE HAS THAT AESTHETIC. YOU DON’T HAVE TO WONDER FOR TEN SECONDS IF IT’S A TIM BURTON FILM. >> I HAVE A PRESENT FOR YOU. >> EDWARD SCISSOR HANDS IS KIND OF A FRANKENSTEIN STORY. VINCENT PRICE PLAYS HIS FATHER WHO CREATES A BOY BUT DIES BEFORE HE CAN PUT HIS HANDS ON. >> EDWARD SCISSOR HANDS WAS A CHARACTER TIM HAD BROUGHT TO LIFE THROUGH A CONCEPT DRAWING. I’VE SEEN TIM DRAW A CHARACTER WITH TWO STROKES OF A BRUSH AND YOU KNEW WHO THEY WERE. >> A GRAND SLAM. JUAN MARTINEZ TO MAKE IT A FIVE‐RUN INNING AND BLOW IN GAME TO PIECES. >> I’LL BE DARNED. >> WITH TIM AND HIS CHARACTERS, THERE’S ALWAYS A REAL CONNECTION WITH HIM AND JOHNNY DEPP. >> THERE’S KIND OF A WAY OF SPEAKING WITHOUT SPEAKING AND COMMUNICATING WHICH IS WHY HE WAS EDWARD SCISSOR HANDS. IT GOES BACK TO SILENT MOVIES WHERE PEOPLE COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR EYES. I FEEL SOME CONNECTION TO HIM OR WYNNONA RYDER. THERE’S SOMETHING ABOUT THE INTENSITY AND GAZE THAT’S WELL, IT WAS LIKE FILM ACTING. > SO ARE WE GOING TO BE WORKING TOGETHER? >> REALLY? WORST FILM YOU EVER SAW. WELL, MY NEXT ONE WILL BE BETTER. HE HAD LOW? >> SED WARD IS SUCH A SWEET MOVIE. AND YET, IT’S NOT AT ALL CLAWING. IT’S COMPLETELY COOL AND CRAZY. >> HE’S A MONSTER.

YOU JUST LOVE HIM FOR HIS ENTHUSIASM. >> ALL RIGHT. PREPARE FOR SCENE 32. >> MR. WOOD? >> WHERE IS THE COCKPIT? >> YOU’RE STANDING IN IT. >> PLACES. >> ED WOOD WHEN HE WAS MAKING A MOVIE THOUGHT TESTIFIES MAKING "STARS WARS." EVERY TIME YOU EMBARK ON A MOVIE IT’S GOING TO BE THE GREATEST MOST AMAZING THING. >> ED WOOD WAS NOT MAKE AS A JOKE. IT WAS LOVINGLY MADE IN APPRECIATION OF WHAT THAT GUY HAD DONE. >> THESE ACTORS REALLY LOVED THEIR CRAFT AND THAT KIND OF WEIRD SORT OF SENSE OF FAMILY YOU GET IN FILM. THIS FELT VERY CLOSE TO ME. IT JUST FELT LIKE MY OWN LIFE. A BUNCH OF WE’DOS TRY TO MAKE A MOVIE. THAT’S EASILY RELATABLE TO ME. >> THIS IS THE ONE. THIS IS ONE I’LL BE REMEMBERED FOR. GO HOME. BAD WOLF. BAD WOLF. >> WHEN YOU THINK OF THE ’90s YOU DO THINK OF ACTORS IN THE DIRECTOR’S CHAIR. YOU THINK OF KEVIN COSTNER, YOU THINK OF JODI FOSTER, YOU THINK OF MEL GIBSON. AND YOU THINK OF CLINT EASTWOOD WHO FINALLY GETS HIS DUE IN THE ’90s. >> UNFORGIVEN IS A MIR CUE LUS FILM IN MANY WAYS. THE LEGACY IN EASTWOOD’S CASE OF ALL THE SPAGHETTI WESTERNS AND THE WESTERNS AND THE DIRTY HARRY FILMS IS LANDED ON THIS MOMENT OF FRAILTY. >> DID PA USED TO KILL FOLKS? >> MY AGENT CALLED AND SAID CLINTETWOOD HAS MADE AN OFFER. >> CLINT EASTWOOD HAS WHAT? >> YES. YOU’LL BE HIS PARTNER IN THIS WESTERN. WELL, SHUCKS. TELL HIM I’LL THINK ABOUT IT. >> I REMEMBER THAT WAS THREE MEN YOU SHOT, WILL, NOT TWO. >> I AIN’T LIKE THAT NO MORE, ED.

KILLED JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT WALKS OR CRAWLED OR AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER. AND I’M HERE TO KILL YOU, LITTLE BILL. FOR WHAT YOU DID TO NED. >> CLINT IS MAYBE THE BEST DIRECTOR I’VE EVER WORKED WITH. I LOVE THE WAY HE DOES IT. HE’S QUICK. HE’S DECISIVE. JUST BEAUTIFUL. >> THERE ARE DIRECTORS IN THIS PERIOD LIKE MICHAEL MANN WHO ARE THE REBELS. WITHIN THE STUDIO SYSTEM, GUYS WHO ARE JUST DOING IT DIFFERENTLY. >> WHAT AM I DOING? I’M TALKING TO AN EMPTY TELEPHONE. >> I DON’T UNDERSTAND. >> BECAUSE THERE WAS A DEAD MAN ON THE OTHER END OF THIS. >> HE PROVIDES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY SEE ROBERT DeNIRO AND AL PACINO ON SCREEN TOGETHER DOING A SCENE TOGETHER. >> WHAT DO YOU SAY I BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE. >> THE SCENE IN THE DINER ALL THREE OF US BOBBY AND AL AND MYSELF KNEW IT WAS THE NEXUS OF THE WHOLE FILM. >> YOU KNOW I CHASE DOWN SOME GUYS. GET BUSTED BACK AT YOU. YOU MUST HAVE WORKED SOME CRUISE. I WORKED ALL KINDS. IT’S ONE OF MY FAVORITE SCENES BETWEEN THOSE TWO GUYS THAT FINALLY COME TOGETHER. I THINK WE DID A GOOD JOB WITH IT. I DO WHAT I DO BEST. I TAKE SCORES. YOU DO WHAT YOU DO BEST, TRYING TO STOP GUYS LIKE ME. >> THEY ARE NOT TAKING THEIR EYES OFF EACH OTHER. IT ALMOST REFLECTS IT. >> I WILL NOT HESITATE. NOT FOR A SECOND. >> PEOPLE WANT TO SEE GREAT ACTORS TELLING YOU THE TRUTH. GUYS LIKE MICHAEL MANN WOULD BE ALWAYS PUNCH YOU IN THE GUT. THEY WOULD MAKE A MOVIE THAT WOULD BE COUNTER TO EVERYTHING ELSE EVERYONE WAS DOING BUT IT WOULD HAVE TRUTH IN IT. >> YOU WANT YOUR OWN WIFE KIDNAPPED. >> YEAH. >> I THINK "FARGO" IS A PERFECT MOVIE IN EVERY WAY. THE SCREENPLAY IS PERFECT. THE EXECUTION OF IT IS PERFECT. THE PERFORMANCES ARE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. >> GEEZ. >> IT WAS WRITTEN FOR ME. I GOT EXCITED. THEY SAID JOEL CAME HOME FROM WORK AND STARTED WORKING ON SOMETHING. THERE’S A PART FOR YOU. >> WE GOT A SHOOTING. THESE FOLKS DRIVE BY. THERE’S A HIGH SPEED PURSUIT, ENDS HERE AND THEN THIS EXCUSE TYPE DEAL. >> JOETH AND ETHAN’S SCRIPTS ARE PUBLISHABLE, WOULD OF LITERATURE.

AND IT’S BEAUTIFUL. >> AND THE OSCAR GOES TO ETHAN AND JOEL COHEN FOR FARGO. >> THE OSCAR GOES FRANCES McDORMAND IN FARGO. >> FARGO WAS THE COHEN BROTHERS FILM THAT REALLY GETS EMBRACED AT THE ACADEMY AWARDS. EVERYONE LOVES THIS MOVIE. WHAT DO THEY DO? SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. >> SOMETIMES THERE’S A MAN, WELL, HE’S THE MAN FOR HIS TIME AND PLACE. >> "THE BIG LEBOWSKI," ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES IS HOW LONG IT TOOK JEFF BRIDGES TO AGREE TO DO IT. IT WAS SO GOOD. JOEL AND NATHAN WROTE IT FOR HIM, SENT IT TO HIM. HE SAID IT’S GREAT. NOT SURE I CAN DO THIS. I JUST REMEMBER THEM THINKING HOW COULD HE NOT? AND OBVIOUSLY, HE CAME TO THAT CONCLUSION HIMSELF. >> WAIT, LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO YOU. I AM NOT MR. LEBOWSKI. YOUR MR. LEBOWSKI, I’M THE DUDE. THAT’S WHAT YOU CALL ME, YOU KNOW? THAT OR HIS DUDENESS OR DUDER OR YOU KNOW, EL DUDEORINO IF YOU’RE NOT INTO THE BREVITY THING. >> IT’S THE ONLY TIME IN MY LIFE I HAVEN’T BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AN ACTOR IN THE EYE BECAUSE HE WAS SO FUNNY. >> JEFFREY. >> MAUDE? >> LOVE ME. >> THAT’S MY ROBE. >> BIG LEBOWSKI IS THE MOST QUOTABLE MOVIE OF MY GENERATION. >> THAT RUG REALLY TIED THE ROOM TOGETHER, DID IT NOT. >> HEY. >> THE COHEN BROTHERS ARE SUB VERSIVE FILMMAKERS, REVOLUTIONARY BOMB THROWERS BUT YOU’RE KIND OF PLEASED LANDED ON YOUR FRONT PORCH. >> THEY’VE KEPT CONTROL OF THEIR FILMS FROM THE BEGINNING IN A WAY THAT ALLOWED THEM TO REALLY EXPLORE ANY GENRE THAT THEY WANTED TO GO INTO. I THINK BY EXPLORING THE GENRE, THEN THEY SUBVERTED IT. >> JACK HORNER, FILMMAKER >>> REALLY? >> YEAH. MAKE ADULT FILMS, EXOTIC PICTURES. >> WHERE I GREW UP WAS THE IMPORTANTO CAPITAL OF THE WORLD IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. I WOULD KNOW WHAT A REGULAR FILM SHOOT WOULD LOOK LIKE AND WOULD KNOW THE DIFFERENCE WHEN IT WAS LIKE A VAN. THAT’S WHERE BOOGIE NIGHTS CAME FROM, A WORLD THAT I KNEW ALREADY REALLY WELL FUNNY ENOUGH. >> WHO IS DIRK DIGLER? >> THAT’S THAT NEW GOOD LOOKING KID, EDDIE AT THE CLUB. >> GOOD NAME. >> WHEN I GOT PAUL’S SCRIPT FOR BOOGIE NIGHTS I CALLED MY AGENT AND SAID ARE YOU PUNKING ME. IT WAS AN X RATED SCRIPT. THEY SAID IT’S GOING TO BE R. I SAID NOTIFY IT’S NOT. THERE’S COPULATING IN IT. >> THEY SAID NO, IT’S THE CONTRACT. I SAID I’M IN. THAT AMBER SHOULD DIE. HE’S LIKE SHE CAN’T DIE. I WAS LIKE SHE WOULD. SHE PROBABLY WOULD. I DON’T KNOW THAT SHE WOULD HAVE SURVIVED ALL OF THAT. I’LL ASK YOU IF YOU’RE MY MOM OKAY, AND YOU SAID YES, OKAY? ARE YOU MY MOM? >> YES, HONEY. >> YES. >> SHE KIND OF ASSUMES THE MANTLE OF PARENTING IN THIS WORLD. SHE’S NOT ACTUALLY TAKING CARE OF THEM. SHE’S PLAY ACTING. > WHAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT THEN IS COMING TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE CUSTODY OF ANDREW. >> YES. >> THE THING THAT I REALLY LOVE ABOUT THE SCENE AS SHE’S KIND OF FIGHTING FOR CUSTODY, THE JUDGE TURNS TO HER AND SAYS MAGGIE, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN ARRESTED. >> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU WERE ARRESTED AND WHAT WAS THE CHARGE? >> >>.>> YOU CUT TO OUTSIDE AND AMBER SOBBING BECAUSE THAT’S JUST IT. SHE’S SOMEBODY WHO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO PARENT. >> YOU DON’T HAVE TO BE INTERESTED IN PORNOGRAPHY TO BE INTERESTED IN BROKEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN REJECTED BY THEIR FAMILY, THEY DON’T HAVE A FAMILY. THE MORAL CENTER OF THE MOVIE IS ALL THESE BROKEN HUMANS TRYING TOO MAKE THEMSELVES WHOLE BILL FINDING A STITCHED TOGETHER FAMILY WHEN THEY DON’T HAVE THE AN ACTUAL FAMILY OF THEIR OWN. >> PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON HAS NEVER MADE THE SAME MOVIE TWICE. WHENEVER YOU SEE A PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON MOVIE LIKE STANLEY COUPE BRICK, YOU KNOW IT’S A PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON MOVIE. I’M NOT SURE THERE’S A HIGHER COMPLIMENT YOU CAN PAY TO A DIRECTOR. IS IMPRINT IS ON HIS FILMS. >> COME ON, FRANK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? >> WHAT AM I DOING? >> YEAH. >> I’M QUIETLY JUDGING YOU. THE PIANO WAS KRAVISHING AND ALSO UNCOMPROMISE. IT’S A REALLY VISCERAL MOVIE. YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE FABRIC. THE DAMPNESS OF THE AIR AND THE MOSS. >> MA. >> AND IT’S SO INHERENTLY JANE. JANE CAMPION IS A FILMMAKER FROM NEW ZEALAND WHO SHOT THIS VERY INTIMATE MOVIE IN HER HOME COUNTRY STARRING HOLLY HUNTER, HARVEY KEITEL AND A VERY YOUNG ANA PACK QUINN. >> IT WAS KIND OF INTIMAIES THAT JANE PULLED US INTO AS AN AUDIENCE. SHE HAS A VOICE NOT TO BE DENIED. >> IT’S MY MOTHER’S CHANNEL. >> IT’S AN EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE IN THE FILM. AND ALSO HOLLY IS A VERY ACCOMPLISHED PIANIST. IT’S ONE OF THOSE PERFECT ROLES FOR THE PERFECT ACTOR. THIS MOVIE ESTABLISHED JANE CAMPION. SHE WON THE PALM DOOR AT CANNES AND BECAME THE SECOND WOMAN TO BE NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR FOR DIRECTING. >> YOUR FATHER’S BEEN ‐‐ >> THE ’90s WAS THE BEST TIME FOR WOMEN DIRECTORS. THEY INFUSED A KIND OF A SENSIBILITY THAT MADE IT REALLY ENJOYABLE. YOU WERE HANGING OUT WITH OTHER FILMMAKERS SAYING WOW, HOW MANY MOVIES CAN I MAKE? HOW MANY WOMEN CAN I WORK WITH. >> YOU STILL HAVEN’T FIGURED WHAT THE RIDING WAVES IS ALL ABOUT, HAVE YOU? >> IT’S A STATE OF MIND. >> THEY DON’T WANT TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FEMALE DIRECTOR. I THOUGHT MY WHOLE CAREER TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED AS A FILMMAKER, NOT A BLACK FILMMAKER I’M SURE THOSE WOMEN ARE SAYING DON’T CALL ME A TEE MAIL DIRECTOR. I’M A DIRECTOR. >> I’M A BAD THERAPIST.

THEY’RE LIKE DOGS. YOU HAVE TO CLEAN THEM AND FEED THEM. THEY’RE LIKE THESE NERVOUS CREATURES THAT JUMP AND SLOBBER ALL OVER YOU. >> OH, GET OFF OF ME. OH, AS IF. >> WHEN I WAS WRITING "CLUELESS" I HUNG AROUND BEVERLY HILLS HIGH SCHOOL A LOT. THERE WAS A TEACHER WHO TAUGHT DEBATE AND HE LET ME HANG OUT IN HIS CLASS. SO YOU HEARD THE VERNACULAR. >> IN CONCLUSION, MAY I PLEASE REMIND YOU THAT IT DOES NOT SAY RSVP ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY.

IT’S OKAY. >> IT’S GOT HEADY IDEAS ABOUT TIME TRAVEL AND ABOUT THE SPACE/TIME CONTINUUM WHAT SOUNDS LIKE FANCY SCI‐FI PA LAVOR BUT ALSO A STORY ABOUT BEING RELENTLESS. JIM AS A FILMMAKER IS RELENTLESS. >> WHEN JAMES CAMERON GOT TO T2, HE WAS INTERESTED IN EXPANDING HIS PALATE, PARTICULARLY TO INCLUDE THESE NEW DIGITAL TOOLS. IT WAS WILDLY GROUND BREAKING. CAMERON WAS WORKING WITH INDUSTRIAL LIGHT AND MAGIC. >> AS TA LA VISTA, BABY. >> AND THEY WERE REALLY KIND OF INVENTING THIS PROCESS OF CGI AS THEY WENT. WHEN YOU FIRST HERD THAT STEVEN SPOOERL SPIELBERG WOULD BE MAKING A MOVIE ABOUT A PLACE WHERE DINOSAURS WERE BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE, YOUR FIRST RESPONSE WOULD BE, I CAN’T WAIT TO SEE THAT. >> WHERE’S THE GOAT. >> THE AMAZING HOW LONG IT TAKES BEFORE THE T‐REX COMES OUT. HE MAKES YOU WAIT FOR IT. AND WAIT FOR IT. AND WAIT FOR IT. I DON’T KNOW WHAT A DINOSAUR REALLY LOOKS LIKE IN REAL LIFE. I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE "JURASSIC PARK." >> BOY, I HATE BEING RIGHT ALL THE TIME. >> WHAT STEVEN SPIELBERG INNATELY UNDERSTANDS IS THAT DINOSAURS ARE AWESOME. >> IT WAS THE SAME FEELING THAT I HAD AS A 7‐YEAR‐OLD WATCHING "JAWS" FOR THE FIRST TIME WHEN YOU SEE THE BRONTASAURUS’S LEAP UP AND EAT THE LEAVES OFF THE TREES. >> WE’RE GOING TO MAKE A FORTUNE WITH THIS PLACE. >> I MEAN, THAT’S WHAT SPIELBERG DOES AS A FILMMAKER. HE MAKES YOU YOU GO OH. >> A LOT OF THE ENTHUSIASM FOR CGI COMES FROM FILMMAKERS SEEING IN JURASSIC PARK WHAT THAT TECHNOLOGY COULD DO FOR THEIR STORY TELLING. >> "TITANIC" IS A THROWBACK IN SO MANY WAYS TO THE BIG BLOCKBUSTERS OF THE 50s AND ’60s. NOT JUST IN ITS SCOPE AND IN ITS SCALE BUT ALSO THAT IT WAS TALKED ABOUT IN THE WAY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT CLEOPATRA". OH GOD, WE’RE PUTTING EVERYTHING WE HAVE INTO THIS GIANT BOAT AND IS IT GOING TO SINK. >> SITS BUDGET AT THAT POINT HIT A THEN UNDER HEARD OF $200 MILLION. >> LEO DiCAPRIO HAD DONE WHAT’S EATING GILBERT GRAPE AND HIS ROMEO AND JULIETTE HAD NOT COME OUT YET. THERE WAS NERVOUSNESS ON THE PART OF SOME EXECUTIVES LIKE CAN LEO DO THIS THING. >> THE STUDIO THOUGHT THEY WERE IN A TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE TROUBLE. IT WAS GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUS DISASTER AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME. >> I’M THE KING OF THE WORLD! >> "TITANIC" REALLY HAD EVERYTHING. IT WAS AN EPIC OLD FASHIONED MOVIE. >> ICEBERG, AHEAD. >> AN ACTION MOVIE. IT ALSO HAD A LOVE STORY AT THE HEART OF IT. >> I’M JACK DAWSON. >> ROSE. >> I HAVE TO GET TO YOU WRITE THAT ONE DOWN. >> IT WAS IRRESISTIBLE. JACK AND ROSE AND IT WAS SEXY.

AND FROM THIS MOMENT ON, ’97, THE WORLD GOES COMPUTER. >> YOU HAVE TO LET IT ALL GO, FEAR, DOUBT. AND DISBELIEF. FREE YOUR MIND. >> WHOA. >> THE MATRIX" CHANGES EVERYTHING. YOU HAVE THE EMBRACE OF EASTERN CINEMA INTO WESTERN CANON. AND YOU’VE GOT THEM MAKING THEIR ACTORS DO THE STUNTS THEMSELVES. QUIJANO REEVES HAD ALREADY DONE ""POINT BREAK,"" AND "SPEED," BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF ACTION STAR THAT HE’S TRANSFORMING INTO. THIS WAS SIX MONTHS OF TRAINING EVERY ACTOR HAD TO GO THROUGH. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU GET WHEN YOU’RE HAVING THE ACTORS DO THEIR OWN STUNTS YOU CAN FILM CLOSE‐UPS OF THE FACE WHILE A PUNK IS BEING TAKEN, WHILE A PUNCH IS BEING THROWN. THE ACTION ITSELF BECOMES STORY TELLING. >> AS CGI GETS BETTER, WE BECOME A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED IN OUR TASTE BECAUSE EACH YEAR THEY GET SO MUCH MORE REALISTIC AND LIFE LIKE. >> WOW, HE IS THE ONE. .>>> I WANT TO TELL YOU MY SECRET NOW. >> OKAY. >> I SEE DEAD PEOPLE. >> I REMEMBER IN ’99, EVERYONE I KNEW, EVERYONE IN OUR CROWD WAS WORKING ON SOMETHING THAT FELT EXCITING AND FELT LIKE IT HAD A GENERATIONAL VOICE IN IT. >> I’M SCARED TO CLOSE MY EYES.

I’VE BEEN OUT IN THE WORLD GIVING MY WORD AND BACKING IT UP WITH ACTION. >> I’D STACK ’99 UP AGAINST ANY YEAR IN AMERICAN FILM MAKING IN TERM OF A REAL COHORT OF GREAT FILM MAKERS DROPPING REALLY SIGNIFICANT WORK. >> NOT WASTING ANY TIME, ARE YOU, TRACY? >> WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE EARLY BIRD. >> YEAH, I DO. >> ELECTION IS THE SECOND MOVIE OF ALEXANDER PAIN. REESE WITHERSPOON’S TRACY FLICK IS SOMEONE YOU ALMOST WANT TO ROOT FOR BECAUSE OF HER PASSION AND DRIVE, AND YET ALSO SHE HAS A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH AMBITION. >> THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT BY PEOPLE JUST LIKE ME WHO WORK VERY HARD AND DON’T HAVE EVERYTHING HANDED TO THEM ON A SILVER SPOON. >> WHAT’S BRILLIANT ABOUT "ELECTION" IS YOU’RE GETTING VOICE‐OVER FROM ABOUT THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES. >> HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD SUFFER BECAUSE OF HER. I HAD TO STOP HER. >> ALEXANDER PANE MADE A VERY PROGRESSIVE MOVIE. IT’S A REMARKABLE FILM. >> WHO ARE YOU? >> BOYS DON’T CRY IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY, A MAN WHO WAS A TRANS MAN LIVING IN A SMALL COMMUNITY. HE FELL IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN, THEY HAD RELATIONSHIP AND OTHER PEOPLE DISCOVERED THIS WAS A TRANS MAN AND SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AND MURDERED HIM. >> "BOYS DON’T CRY" JUST A PHENOMENAL MOVIE. LIKE NO STUDIO WOULD HAVE MADE THAT MOVIE. IT WAS A GAME CHANGER IN TERM OF AMERICAN CINEMA IN WHAT WAS MADE BEFORE AND WHAT WAS MADE AFTERWARDS. >> 1999 WAS SUCH A GREAT YEAR IN INDEPENDENCE CINEMA. YOU LOOK AT THAT LINE‐UP OF FILMS FROM VIRGIN SUICIDES TO THREE KINGS TO BEING JOHN MALACOVICH. >> THERE’S A TINY DOOR IN MY OFFICE, MAXINE. IT’S A PORTAL AND IT TAKES YOU INSIDE JOHN MALACOVICH. YOU SEE THE WORLD THROUGH HIS EYES AND AFTER ABOUT 15 MINUTES YOU’RE SPIT OUT INTO A DITCH ON THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE. >> IT’S A GREAT COMBINATION. SPIKE JONES AND CHARLIE COFMAN, AND THEY KIND OF REMIND PEOPLE THAT MOVIES CAN BE SO MUCH MORE. >> WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A MAN GOES THROUGH HIS OWN PORTAL? >> WE’LL SEE. >> IT’S A META FICTIONAL DIVE INTO LITERALLY THE BRAIN OF JOHN MALACOVICH WHO’S IN THE MOVIE PLAYING HIMSELF. >> MALACOVICH. MALACOVICH. >> IT’S ONE OF THOSE MOVIES IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE AND IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE YOU’RE PILING ONE ABSURDITY ONTO ANOTHER, BUT IT ALL COHERES INTO THIS CRAZY AND BEAUTIFUL FILM. >> I WANT YOU TO DO ME A FAVOR. >> YEAH, SURE. >> I WANT YOU TO HIT ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN. >> WHAT? >> I WANT YOU TO HIT ME AS HARD AS YOU CAN. >> SOMETIMES A PIECE OF MATERIAL FINDS A FILMMAKER WHO IS UNIQUELY POSSESSED OF THE CHOPS TO DO IT RIGHT.

IT CONNECTED THE WAY WE WANTED IT TO CONNECT AND IT’S STILL GROWING. FOR ME THAT’S THE HIGHEST >> IN THE ’90s YOU’VE GOT THESE TRENDS AND MOMENTS THAT ARE GOING TO CARRY ON FOR THE NEXT FEW DECADES. YOU HAVE THIS MOMENT OF REALLY PROMISING BLACK FILM MAKERS THAT ARE COMING UP. YOU HAVE WOMENS VOICES NOW COMING TO THE FOREFRONT IN THAT THEY’RE WRITING FILMS AND DIRECTING FILMS. THEY’RE ALSO GETTING SOME BIG BLOCK BUSTERS AS HOLLYWOOD ALWAYS HAS. IT LAYS THE GROUND WORK FOR WHAT WE’RE GOING TO SEE FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS. >> YOU WANT ANSWERS. >> I THINK WE’RE ENTITLED. >> I WANT THE TRUTH.
