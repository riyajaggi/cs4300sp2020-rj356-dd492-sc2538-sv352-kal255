 Dad, my pocket money! Money, money, money. That's all you think about. I thought you might like this. Thanks. I'm good, but thanks. Sit down. Stop it! Move your head! Yes. Come on! - Morning. - What have we got? The dead woman's bag was found in the hotel room. But no wallet and no phone, so no ID. Didn't she check in? It was checked in under the name of Ben Jackinov. I think it's fair to say that's a pseudonym.

 - Jesus. - Potential murder weapon? All right, I'll check that in a bit. Got a description of the man? Fairly general. How was it paid for? Didn't the hotel take a credit card swipe? Cash, and there's only CCTV on the outside of the building. But the manager did offer us something useful. He recalls the woman going outside to take a mobile phone call. It's timecoded so we can trace it. Without knowing what network she's on, how long will it take? Right now, it's all I've got. All right, put in a comms request to all the main providers. I want a name and address as soon as possible. If you want my opinion, from the blood on the back of the door, the attack started when she came out of the bathroom. Ally, you be the victim. - Why me? - Because you're... All right, you be the victim. Get in touch with your female side. So she was probably having a leak in the bathroom. You don't have to do that part. When she comes out... She gets a blow to the back of the head. - Wallop! - Agh! Now, it's bad but it doesn't kill her. She goes down on the bed. She's probably out cold when the attacker comes at her again. Wallop! Wallop! Are you enjoying this? The attacker's covered in blood. From the traces we found in the bathroom, I reckon he took time to wash before making his, or her - equality - exit. Where are you going? I've just bludgeoned you to death. Mark! Happy birthday. I was just out for a run so I thought I'd... I thought I'd come and surprise you. - Right. - Life lesson there, isn't there? You should never turn up unannounced. I saw him leave. So what was Kenton doing here? Did he stay the night? Laura, can you talk to me, please? Is there any point lying? Why would you do that? That's... He's my husband. You said it was over. - Yeah, it was. - Was? Past tense. Wow! Oh, my God. Who cheats on their lover with their husband? I have to go to work. Is that all you've got to say? - Do you want me to lose my job? - No, I don't. I just want you to tell me the last few months meant something to you. You said it was over between you two, that it had finished. You told me you wanted something different. OK. - Nice arse, Britney. - Britnay. "Nice arse, Britnay." Hey, Brit! Psychopath, then, is it? Bludgeoned to death with a hammer - we can rule out manslaughter. Shame, really. She was quite hot. Yeah, that makes it so much worse. Forensics report from Ken. With the DNA results from the plaster found at the scene. The ones I asked for half an hour ago? We were training, Danny. That shit's sacrosanct. Yeah, well, as long as your abs are ripped. Don't wish for it, my friend - work for it. - Whoa! - You all right? - All right, mate. - You all right? Happy birthday, bud. I got you a gift. But it's still in the shop. Man, that's perfect, cause I can just collect it when I don't get yours next month. Thank you very much. No Laura? No, she had a work's dinner, couldn't shift things around. Couldn't shift things around? I'm not six, Slade. We only do this for my mum. Have you heard from Danny? - No, has he not called? - Mm-mn. Maybe he couldn't shift things around. Hello, I'd just like to say a few words. You know, it's a sobering moment for a father when you look at your son - your baby - and you realise... that he's reached the age where he can no longer call himself young. If he's becoming an old fart, what does that make me? - A grave dodger! - Oi! So I'd like you all, please, to raise a glass. Ignore his crow's feet and his receding hairline. - Thanks, mate. - And wish a happy birthday... to my little boy. To Mark. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday! Sorry, sorry. Um... I wanted to say something too. As you all know, we've had some difficult times in the past. I have two sons... Mark... - And Jesse. - Hey, Mum. But only one of them who's here every year on his birthday. All right, Julie. Happy birthday, son. Happy birthday! Come on! - Happy birthday. - Cheers. Sorry. Don't be sorry. You OK? - I love you. - I love you too. I'm just gonna go and see Danny. Two secs. Hiya, mate, you OK? - Sorry I'm late. - That's all right, mate. Listen, I need to talk to you about something. All right, pal. What is it? There's a... There's a case that I'm working on, it's a murder. We found something at the scene. What? Blood, but it's not the victim's. We um... We ran some DNA tests and there's a match. Mark, it's Jesse. The DNA, it's Jesse. He's alive. So you're saying he's a murderer? No, nobody's saying anything. 20 years. 20 years! What the hell? I don't know. Nobody knows. What... So his DNA's at a murder scene and... he's not the victim, so what does that leave? He's a witness or just someone that happens to be there? I'm gonna double-check the results, triple-check them, OK? There's a possibility the DNA's old. 20 years. I'm saying it's possible. He may not have been there. Mark, think about this. Jesse. - I know. - It means he's alive. Yeah, I know, you're right. I know, I know. Is what we've always wanted, right? Oh, man, it doesn't make any sense to me. What am I gonna tell my mum, my dad? Nothing. Not yet, OK? I shouldn't even be talking to you guys. I could get fired. - Yeah. - OK? Sorry. This thing could end up going public. It's the sort of thing the papers'll be all over. If it comes to that, we'll let them know. Don't you think there's someone else we should tell? Someone who was with us that day. - Pru? - Yeah, Pru. Come on. Dad, I want to ask you something. Do you remember him? This is Jesse, Dad. You remember he went missing as a young boy? It's a case you worked on when you were a copper. Jesse, Alan's boy. He's back, Dad. Jesse's come back. Leave her alone! Dad? Look at him. - Take his face away, please. - He didn't do it. - He admitted to it. - And you believed that? Dad, I know he wrote you letters. I destroyed them. They gave me the creeps. - All of them? - Yes. What about Mum? Did she keep any? You'll have to ask her. What is all this, Mark? It was 20 years ago. Why are you churning all this up again? Here we are. One chicken curry and one lamb tagine, sir. - Thank you very much. - Enjoy your meals. Disgusted or not, you must've read them. - Yes, of course I read them. - And? - Well, he wanted us to meet him. - Uh-huh. He wanted us to talk. But of course, we wouldn't entertain the idea. - Why not? - Because he killed your brother. He admitted it but there was never any evidence. Come on, he was seen in the area the night Jesse went missing. He killed four other children. His other victims were older, a different MO. He admitted it. Why does everyone keep talking like he'll turn up one day? Your mother - why do you think we don't live together anymore? Because she can't move on. He is dead, Mark. Jesse is dead. And this is? We have to do 100, every hour on the hour. I need you to double-check these forensic results. Why, what's the problem? The problem is they don't make any sense. Can you stop that? We've had a DNA hit from the MISPER database, from a kid that went missing in 1995. - What? - Yeah. How about you stop impressing your boyfriend and check them again? - Is that Pru? - Yep, under her married name. - Ooh, Pru Carew. - Yeah, that's unfortunate. To think she could have been Mrs Mark Wells, married to a hotshot lawyer. And we're back in the playground. No, look, now, see she is back. She's working at the Windsor Lockwood Clinic. Why would she come back without telling us? To unravel the mysteries of female logic, we're gonna need stronger drinks. The question is, knowing what we know about Jesse... do you want to see her? - Yeah, I guess. - Good. I messaged her. She said tomorrow's fine. Danny! - Slade. - Hi, darling. - Hey, Pru. - Mark. Hi. Pru. So amazing to see you all again. God, how long's it been? - 16 years. - It can't be. You're looking great, really. So are you. - I know I am. - Not a day older. Apart from your greys. What? Wow. That's big news. Are you OK? Oh, I'm fine, yeah. You know, it's a shock. A hell of a shock. We're working to find out more. Danny felt... We all felt... that seeing as you were there that day, you had a right to know. I've thought about him a lot. Every year on that day. I always remember the date, every year. So... when did you get back from the States? Two years ago. Two years? I know, I know, I should've contacted you all. But... you know how it is, it's just work and... I married an American. Stuart's a workaholic. And, well, I've got a little girl now. Nico, she's nearly six. She's cute. I've got three myself, which is at least one too many. I kept meaning to, I kept putting it off. Then one month turned into six. - I don't know. - You don't need to explain to us. We're big boys, aren't we? But here we are. What's happened? The four of us... grown up! Yeah. And Slade running a shelter. How did that happen? Says the doctor! Private doctor, actually, so... My socialism's gone out the window. Blame the Americans. Well, assuage your conscience. Come and visit. See how we do things. I might enlist your services. I'd like that. Good. - We should all keep in touch. - Definitely. Yeah? Mark, give me more attention! Mark! Mark! Hey, Mark. I want to go and see Marosi. Are you out of your mind? I want to look him in the eye and I just want to ask him some questions. I really don't think that's a good idea. He said that he killed Jesse. So I just want to meet him. Danny, are you gonna help me out? Or am I gonna have to sort this myself? Hello, Mr Wells. I want you to talk about my brother. I killed him. I chose him, I took him and I killed him. Three acts. Simple. I don't believe you. They found the bodies of the other four boys you killed, but not my brother. Why not? I burnt it. And why would you do that? Because he was younger. And what I did to him... was disgusting. I like young boys. And I liked Jesse... A lot. You're already facing life for the other four boys you killed. So you took the rap for Jesse in order to secure yourself privileges in prison. Didn't you? Get yourself back on the front pages. He was crying. Very, very upset. He wanted to go home to his mummy. And I wanted to send him home. But I knew I couldn't. Then I told him I would take him. I put him in my car, started driving. He kind of cheered up. But of course, I wasn't taking him home. I was taking him... somewhere else. You're lying. Am I? Who else is lying about that day, Mark? Are you, are your friends? Jesse was crying when I found him. Who made him cry, huh? The DNA tie-in with the missing kid is potentially huge. For now, this cannot get out. We dig away until we know exactly what we're dealing with, OK? I don't want journalists banging on my door. Danny. Thanks. The murder victim is yet to be ID'd, but we are tracing her mobile as whoever killed her might have taken it with him. Next. Now, given the reputation of the murder location and the manner of her dress, we're working on the possibility she was accepting payment for sex. So it could be a disgruntled client, a partner of someone. Or drug related. Every hooker I've encountered was an addict. We all know how many hookers Mickey's encountered. OK, yeah, very funny. As to the DNA findings... Didn't you know this kid? Weren't you there that day? He was the brother of a friend of mine. I don't intend to let that cloud my judgment. I'm gonna deal with this case like I deal with any other - professionally. All right. The murder weapon. Daddy! - Mark. - Hi. I need to tell you something. Right now? No, Mum, tomorrow night. Now, of course now. And this is? We were married for 23 years, Mark. You both need to hear this. I told you, didn't I? I told you I knew he was alive. It's a mistake. It's a mistake. It's been checked. It's DNA. - It's a mistake! - Alan. Accept it. What, accept that he's alive? Give myself that hope only to have it dragged away? We're gonna get our boy back. I would give anything... anything to put my arms around my son again. But what is this? Where does this leave us? Just like when he went, with a million questions and no answers. - No. - Alan, don't walk away. - We can't do this again. - Don't do this to me. Don't walk out when I need you the most, please. Don't do it again. Like what you see? Ohh! She's just the greatest kid. And I know it's a terrible parent cliché, but... she just makes me laugh more than anyone else I know. - She sounds great. - You should meet her. - I'd love to. - So what about you? Nothing like that on the horizon? Fatherhood, responsibility? Oh, me? Nah, no chance! Slade said you were seeing someone. Er... yeah, I am. Laura. Yes... No, she's great. But, you know, early days. - Are you serious about her? - I'm crazy about her. - And is she about you? - Of course she is. Look at me. I'm a hell of a catch. No, I mean, she's just... Honestly, she's just a bit scared of taking it to the next level. Anyway, tell me about... Stuart. Erm... We met in the States. He worked in the building next to the hospital I was working in. I used to see him the whole time. I mean, I never thought I'd end up with someone in finance. But he's just one of those people. He gets what he wants. You know. And I guess he wanted me. God! Know what? I've really missed you over the years. Me too. You know, you're the only person that I was ever able to talk to, after Jesse... Why didn't you contact me... when you came back? You know, no bullshit, Pru. The real reason. I don't know. I just... I just thought... the past was better left alone. It's Slade. Hey, Slade. Just checking in to see you're OK. Where are you? - I'm just out. - Out where? Just out with a friend. With a friend? Yes, Slade, a friend. I do have them. Put her on. Sorry? Pru. Put her on. Hello? Hi, Pru. How's he doing? He didn't seem too good the other night. Yeah, you know, he's fine, considering. - Did he speak much about Jesse? - Not really. Did he tell you he went to see Marosi? No. He's bottling it up. He's dealing with this all on his own. Come on! I bet he didn't tell you his girlfriend dumped him. Hold on one second. All right, you horrible lot. Leave him alone. What's going on, Stevie? Talk to me. I don't want to take it. I think you should kick that ball as hard as you can. Go for it. Listen to me, Pru. He's going through a lot right now. Promise me you'll be there if he needs you. I promise. OK, great. Bye. I think I have one for you. Please. - Please, no. - It's all right. I'm here to help you. Mark, it's me. Listen. I need Pru's number. She should be in hospital. No. Sorry, no can do. Hospitals require all kinds of information. No, you're doing great. She needs an internal scan. Did she have anything on her like a phone or ID? No. Nothing. She's yet to speak. Slade, you've dragged me into this, yeah? - And I want things done properly. - Pru. This girl has been attacked, and that requires the police. Listen, if we call the police, we lose their trust. If we lost their trust then we have nothing, OK? No police. So what are you going to do about it? Hey. How did the meeting with Marosi go? Yeah, it was wonderful. Listen, mate, can you get into work? I'm still here. Why? Good, cause I'm gonna send you a photo of a girl. Theoretically, have you had a girl reported missing recently, looks like this? She's got a really distinctive birthmark below her eye. What's this about? - I can't tell you that yet, mate. - Let me get this straight. I'm in the middle of a murder investigation and dead on my feet. You want me to trawl through missing persons for God knows what, risking my career for God knows why, and you expect this just cause we're friends? Yeah, pretty much mate, yeah. I'll call you if I find anything. Hey, any luck tracing the dead woman through the phone networks? Nada. Zip. Nix. Yeah, a simple "no" is fine. No. Hey, Danny. Any news, mate? Yep, her name's Gemma Morgan. She's on here. She's officially a missing person. Since when? Well, here's the kicker. She disappeared five years ago. Five years? Jesus Christ. My brother went missing too. When he was five years old. I've never seen him again. It's hard on those that are left behind. You know. You've been missing for a really long time, Gemma. Where have you been? Were you with someone? Did someone take you? Were you held against your will? Gemma... you can tell me. Nothing bad's gonna happen to you. We'll do everything we can to help you. Were you held? Can you tell me where you've been? Not just me. I'm not the only one. There are more. More? I mean, how many? What are we supposed to do about that? Tread carefully. The last thing we want to do is to freak her out. One piece of information at a time. No, this is massive. You know, maybe Pru's right. Maybe we need to get the cops in on this. - Danny, at least. - No, no, no. Not yet. All right? Hey. Don't you just love the city at night? I wish I was one of those insomniacs. I could live my whole life at night. Except I'd probably get rickets or something. - Right. - Jammy doughnut? - No, I'm all right, thanks. - Where is she? In there. So what's the story, then? Just look after her, make sure she's OK. Help her settle in. Be kind. Yeah, got you. - Right? - Mm-hm. Hey, Br... Brit? Brit? - No, I should check it. - Ohh! - Let me guess. Work? - What? We've finally traced the mobile of the victim from the scene where we found your friend's DNA. Her name's Annie Green. Know the best bit? - It's turned on. - So we can track it? - I'm already on it. - All right. I have to go. Momma, my sister... I have to go. I will see you later. - I will come back. - Go! Chop's on the way there now. Listen up, I'm gonna take the front. I want two cars out the back. Come with me. Ally, round the back! Hold the door. He's gone upstairs. Police! South on Craig Street. Moving south on Craig Street. - Are you OK? - I'm fine. Get him. He's heading into the building. Mickey? I've lost him. He's headed towards the east of the building! Got him? Are you Jesse? Are you Jesse? Tell me if you're Jesse! Just tell me if you're Jesse! Are you Jesse? Jesse! Subtitles by explosiveskull
