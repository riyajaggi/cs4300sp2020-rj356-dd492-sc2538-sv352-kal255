 - I still think I saw him. - You think Jesse's still alive? Or this is a massive hoax? I think Jakob Marosi's behind this. Three acts. Act one: target. Act two: pain. Act three: kill. Guys... - Hey. - Hey. Where are you up to? Er... four down, one to go. Jesse's? Yeah. Do you want me to come in with you? Yeah, OK. Sure. - Is that...? - That's Jesse. Danny, if this is what we think it is...

 There are three tapes for him. Then Jesse's dead and Marosi was telling the truth all along. And if that is the case, then how do we explain his DNA turning up? We can't. There's no explanation. A hoax? Someone screwing with us? These tapes were dropped off anonymously. This is... It makes no sense. And where's Jesse's body? Huh? Maybe the next two tapes will tell us. Try the last one. He didn't kill him. He was going to. But he didn't get him. He didn't get him. So, what can I do for you? We found your tapes. We watched them, for the children you murdered. - Did you enjoy them? - There's a final one. It starts with Jesse. He's a target, you filmed him in the park. But the next two tapes, "pain" and "kill"... they're blank. The timecode on the first tape proves that you were there the day that Jesse went missing. But the tapes, that meticulous ritual that you developed for the other murders, suggests that you didn't kill him. OK. I'll tell you who else was there, under one condition. I want to watch the tape... the Jesse tape. - No fucking way! - We have to. It's sick. He's toying with us! Danny, think clearly. It's one tape of Jesse in the park, that's it. We show him that, he'll talk, tell us something vital. Oh, really? And then what happens if he doesn't? We show it to him, we give him something to wank over, then he smiles his sick little... smile and says, "Oh, yeah. Thanks, thanks for that." - It's a risk we have to take. - Screw him. Screw him, Ally. I'm not doing it. Then we've got nothing. We're no further forward than we were. Fine, show it to him. Give the sick bastard what he wants. The one that got away. The one film I never finished. So what happened, Marosi? Come on, you've seen your video. Tell us what you know about that day. He would have been the next one. He would, without question. I liked him. I wanted him. And he was a target. But then... when I went to lure him in... someone arrived. Someone he knew. And that was that. As far as I know, that person was the last person who "see" Jesse alive. Who was that person? His father. Herbal, very good. Oh, hello. Table for two? Actually, Alan, can we have a word in private? Yeah, sure. Why, what is it? What's happened? We just need you to come to the station with us. Why? It concerns the disappearance of Jesse. We just need to ask you some questions. What questions? What's this, Danny? In the light of new information, we'd like to question you about the disappearance of your son. - New information? - From Jakob Marosi. Oh, you're arresting me? Like father, like son! We're not arresting you, Alan. What new information after all these years? Hm? Ah, Jesus... I'm... I'm not coming in. Sorry, no. I'm not doing it. - Mr Wells, we just want to... - Excuse me! I'm not doing it. All right? But you arrest me, go on. You do it. Because that's the only way I'm coming in to discuss the disappearance of my son based on the information of Jakob bloody Marosi! - Alan... - Come on, come on! - Alan... - You arrest me. Come on! Arrest me! Alan Wells, I am arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Jesse Wells. Can you open your mouth, please, sir? Thank you. That's fine. - Mummy! - Hey! - Are you OK? - Good. How are you? - Are you working? - No, I'm not at work. I'm... helping a friend. So as you know, I can't account for myself. I have no alibi, no corroboration. I was at home in my garden, my own garden, enjoying myself. The last moments of pleasure before everything was ripped away. And... the boys were out playing and I didn't want Jesse to go with Mark. I wanted him to stay home, but he wanted to go. And then... Julie went out to the shops... and... she went with her friend and I stayed at home in my own garden, and I just cut the hedges and I dug up a bit and I tidied the borders. And at no time did you leave the house or the garden? No, because... because what would be the motive? Danny, have you ever asked yourself that? Why would I? What would be the logic? Why would I go out and have... Let's face it, I would kill the son I love? Would you? No, and neither would most people because most normal people... And sadly, that's what I am. I'm normal, an unexceptional man. Would not kill the child they loved. In fact, the only thing that makes me exceptional is having their child abducted. People used to point at me, they used to pity me. And they said, "Look, that's him. That's... That's the bloke that had his kid taken. Do you think he was involved?" And then your dad dragged me in, and it was just fuel to the flames. "It has to be the father. Well, it's always the father." Have you seriously asked yourself the question, why? Why would I? Dad. Dad. What have they done? - Got nothing to say. - What were they asking you? - Speak to your friend. - What were they asking you? - It's all crap! I'm going home. - Let me drive you. - No, I need a walk. - Dad, please. You know what? Maybe it is my fault. I should never have left you in charge of him. Why didn't I just keep him home? Mark! - I tried... - This is bullshit. - No... - Jakob Marosi. Marosi didn't kill him. I'm more sure of that. - You think my dad did? - Maybe nobody did. That's what... You should have waited for me before you interviewed him. Why didn't you wait? Danny, you should have waited for me! Look, the Marosi tapes indicate that Jesse is still alive. I'm trying to find him for you. All right. Danny, I can't handle it. He's naked. He's got an erection! Take me back. - Take me... - What are you doing? Stop that! She doesn't want you! You get that? She doesn't want you! I don't want you. Too bad. I'm all you've got. - Hey. - Hey. You told him yet? Mark? - You know, the love thing? - Sorry. - No, not yet. - Hm. You think I should do it like the films and run through the streets and declare it there and then? If only life was like the movies. Yours is. Yeah, I know. That's true. Cool soundtrack, too. See ya. Hi. Just visiting? She's had him for no time at all and she can't cope? Jen... Danny, we were just getting to a good place. I just walked through the door with a smile on my face. Sun shining... I wanted to take us all out for dinner. This is how I want our lives to be. We've had him for years. I'm sorry if that makes me sound like a bitch. I can't do this anymore. Jen... Jen, listen to me. Yeah, Ken? Yeah, bit of a strange one. - The lab spotted an anomaly. - OK. Yeah, and it's... well, it's pretty significant. Significant like... Well, I did a cross-match between Alan and Jesse Wells' DNA and they don't match. They don't match? As in... Alan Wells is not Jesse's father. Is he my father? Let's just get a DNA test done on that. I'm going to erm... make some calls, see if we can get you in a bit quicker. I don't get it. I mean, if he isn't my dad's... This could be a fuck-up. Hm... Maybe the DNA sample isn't actually Jesse. Yeah, I... I thought that, too. But I've been round the streets on this one. I just... Mark, you know as well as I do the simplest explanation is just usually the right one. Let's go talk to your mum. - You gonna drag her in? - No, come on. Just me and you, or just you if you like. We'll just go to her, talk with her, tell her what we know. Ask her. Danny, you don't think... my dad knew and he did something stupid? Let's just go and talk to your mum. - Hi, Mum. - Hey. Well, there's no point in my denying it, is there? If the science says he's not Alan's, then he's not Alan's. Did you know? They say a woman knows. I didn't. Not for definite. - Mum, am I his? Am I Dad's? - Yes. - Am I? Cause I can take a test. - Yes! God, this all happened long after you were born. Who was it? - A friend. - More specifically, Mum. You might remember him. He used to drive you to school with his two little girls before they... They died in a car crash. His name was Frank Lipton. He lived on my street. Frank Lipton. How long did it last? No time. It was... after his girls died, it was compassion that spilled... Where's Frank now? No idea. He moved away. After Jesse went missing? No, much later. - When? - A year, maybe... two. But he was there in the weeks after. He helped with the search. Why did he leave? New job, new town. - Did you stay in contact with him? - No. We were long over. He was just an old friend who'd moved away. I made a decision. Your dad was Jesse's dad and that was the way I wanted it. He deserves to know. Dad. Why does he? So you can break his heart? What is a dad, anyway, hm? He is the man who is there every day, the one that loves you, and that was Alan. We need to find Frank Lipton. That's my friend just there. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. - How are you? - Yeah, OK. Great. I'm starving. I could eat a scabby dog. Is it a dog or is it a horse? Scabby horse? I don't know the expression. - Oh, thank you. - Thank you. I love you. I've always loved you. And I know I should probably just keep my mouth shut and let things be, but I can't do that. I can't do that because I really feel like we're meant to be. You know, because we were brought together again with all this Jesse stuff. It's brought us back together. And I've never forgotten you. And I know we were kids, but... a feeling is a feeling and... I'm not a kid and I still have that feeling. And I know it's a mess because... I'm married and I don't love him and I've got Nico, but that doesn't mean we can't sort the mess and make it so that we're happy. We could be really happy, I think. Yeah. I'm so sorry, I've got an itchy nose and it's the worst time. So... so... so... go on. This is when you... just... tell me you feel the same and strings play and we kiss and credits roll. Whoa. "Whoa." Well, it's not awful. I mean, it's not... it's not rejection. Mark, please don't answer that. Please. We're having a moment... Pru, it's Danny. I... I think we're really close to something. I'm really... I've got to take this. Hey, Danny. I'm just in the middle of something. Can I call you back? No. You need to meet me at the station. Quick as you can. - It's important. - OK, OK. That was quick. Erm... I need to go and meet Danny. Mark... Pru... I really want to talk about this. I want to talk about it properly. But? You said it with a "but", with caveats, and I'm just so sick of caveats. I need clarity. I've got to feel something real. - But go if you have to. - Pru, I'm so sorry. Two years after Jesse goes missing Frank Lipton falls off the radar. No tax records, no National Insurance, nada. I mean complete disappearing act. So I'm, like, "All right, so he's left the country." But then I found this. When he sold his house he gave his solicitor a forwarding address. It's a cottage his mother left him. - A cottage? Where is it? - Middle of nowhere. Farming country. It's a little town called Fellington, 60 miles from here. So he moves to a remote house, he tries to make himself invisible. Mm-hm. Why would he do that? Fancy some country air? I don't know what department he's in, erm... Sorry, one sec. Hi. Ally, is it? - Yeah. - Hi. I'm Pru, friend of Danny's. - Yes. Are you here to... - I'm looking for Mark. - He's come to see Danny. - OK, cool. I'll take you up. Er... sorry, just a second. Yes? I've been thinking. You know, about the night we... Yes? Well, it was all a bit "cut to the chase", you know? And I'd love to take you out, talk, have dinner. - Karl, this really isn't... - Let me tell you, that smile you've got, it's like the best smile in the whole world. Yeah, that one. And there it is again. - Can we talk about this later? - I tell you what, I'll text you a time and a venue. - You just reply yes or no. - OK. - Sorry. - An admirer? It's just Karl. I'm so, so sorry. I tried calling, but you must have left. It's Mark, he's been up all night. Temperature and vomiting. - We're going to keep him home today. - All right. I'm sorry. Oh, he'll be fine. I just don't like sending him in in this kind of state. Sure, sure. - Hope Mark's feeling better. - Have a good day, Frank. You OK? Let me see that. This is the house. It seems they've left. Mickey said they left in a hurry. I tried to call them, but there's no reply. Oh, OK. What's with this plaster? That's evidence. We probably shouldn't... There's flecks of cotton attached. Is that how they found Jesse's DNA, from that plaster? Did you investigate the reasons why he might have been wearing it? We spoke to the manufacturer. It's one of the most common plasters on the market. But not in homes, in hospitals, immunisation clinics. There's a place less than a mile away from the murder site that does flu shots, holiday jabs. We checked their records, viewed their CCTV. Drew a blank. - What about blood donation? - Checked. All the major centres. - Nothing. - Travelling ones? Well, the Blood Service do a sort of roaming collection. Town halls and hotels and sports centres, that kind of thing. Right. I'd have to check. Don't blood donations use a massive cotton swab? You have to hold them down, apply pressure? On the arm, but not on a thumb prick. And there could be cotton from where it's wiped. What do I know? You're the detective. But speaking as a doctor, I don't think a flu shot would leave that much blood. Right. It's remote. Right? No one can see anything. - You can feel it, can't you? - Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Well, there's furniture, but nothing much else. Come on. Let's go and look inside. It's open. Who just leaves a house behind? Someone leaving in a hurry. We've got food wrappers, drinks cartons. These are recent. Yeah? How can you tell? I'm a detective. They also have a use-by date. I'll get them tested. But someone was here. - Did you hear that? - Uh-huh. There's someone in the house. Hiya. Yeah. Uh-huh. Great. Thank you, Phillipa, this is a great help. Thank you. Bye. The Ferry Hotel. They only had one mobile donor service on the day of the murder. - What about the day before? - Nothing the day before. And no one really wears a plaster that long. We need to find out who gave blood that day. What's their system? There's confidential reports on all the patients and all blood donors have to register with the National Blood Service. OK. But she did say that the tendency was to choose locations with pre-existing security systems for the safety of the staff. CCTV. Come on, then. Look, I... I know what this looks like, but... Well, no one's been here for years and I... I kind of look after the place. - Look after it? - Yeah. For free. I do him a favour, you know. Not that he knows it. I chase away the vandals and I make the place look nice. I live next door. Down the hill. Look, I only come here to escape the wife. I've got three kids at home and a crazy mother-in-law. She's a nightmare, I tell you. Cause a man needs space, doesn't he? This is kind of my man-cave. Do you know anything about the people that used to live here? A family used to come up here for the holidays, you know? - In the Easter, summer. - Can you remember them? Was it a man? A wife? Kids? What? Well, there was a man and woman and er... they had a little lad with them. Might have been their son, I don't know. Do you remember any names? Erm... Frank Lipton? No, no. It was... Ron something. And I think his wife was called erm... Bev, was it? Bev? I'm sorry, it was a long time ago. Get down! Leave him alone or I'll blow your brains out! - What, with an air rifle? - Carol! - They're the bloody police! - Thank you, GI Jane. - The police? - Yeah. How many times have I told you to stay out of this house? He thinks I'm stupid. He comes here with his baby oil and his wank mags. - Oh, drinking again? - Drinking, yes. Wanking, no! I come up here to have a drink so I can get away from you, you bloody woman! I hate to interrupt this beautiful moment of... marital bliss, but do you happen to know the names of the people that owned this place? Harkett? Hackett? Something beginning with 'H'. It's in my filofax. I send them a Christmas card every Christmas. You do? So... you've got their current address? Yeah. Oh, sorry. It's Jen. I'll just... - Yeah? - You'll have to come to the house. Hey, Jen. Listen, I can't really talk right now. Dad, there's a fire! The house is on fire! - What? Where's your mum? - Inside, trying to get Granddad out. He won't come out. I'm scared! OK, listen to me. Call 999... Meg? Meg? Hey, Danny, she's got the address at their house. Danny! Danny, what's going on? There's an emergency. I'm gonna send someone! You've time for a brew, then. Police? I'm the manager, Steve Simmons. How can I help you? There was a mobile blood session at this location on Wednesday 15th April. As part of an ongoing investigation we'd like to check your CCTV footage for that day. 15th April? That's gonna be tricky. See, we erase the discs every seven days. It's a file space issue. I'm really sorry. - You OK? - Do you see what I see? That camera outside that pub. Let's see if they delete after a week. Jen! We're out. We're fine. The fire brigade are in the house now. - What happened? - He set fire to the house. He could have killed us all. You can't go back in yet. It's too dangerous. Ray, listen to me. You can't go back in the house yet. Ray! What are you doing? What are you doing? Huh? Huh? Hit me! Hit me! Hit me! Hit me! Are you OK? You're OK, you're safe. I'm sorry. I don't want to be like him, Jen. I love him, but I don't want to be like him. Just angry and always working and never there for his kids. I just... Can you help me? Just... - Hello? - Hey, Slade. Listen, I need you to come pick me up. Danny's just left me at this farmhouse. We've got a new lead. I think we might be wasting our time. I mean, there's hours of this stuff. I'm not even sure what we're looking for. Jesse. Right, but how will we know if we see him? Hi, excuse me. We're looking for Ronald Hatchett. - First door on your right. - Thank you. Ally. Ally. - What? - You have to see this. Oh, my God. Mark. Frank. It's a smiley face backpack. Mark said the man he was chasing was wearing one. It's Karl. Subtitles by explosiveskull
