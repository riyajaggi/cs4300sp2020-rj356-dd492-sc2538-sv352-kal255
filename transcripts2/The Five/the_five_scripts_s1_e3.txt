 The Five (2016): Season 1, Episode 3 - Episode #1.3 - full transcript 
 Mark is called upon by Simon Marshall, schoolboy son of his ex-lover Laura, to locate his missing father but Laura denies any mystery, claiming he is on a business trip. Whilst at Selina's flat Danny disturbs the young suspect from the murder and pursues him, with the youth ending in a coma in hospital. Julie is adamant that he is not Jesse but then he disappears. Danny returns to Newman's house to find he has been murdered and, after freeing Newman's captives, finds Jesse's DNA at the scene. Pru, having seen Brit at Slade's request, has an admission for Mark, regarding the day Jesse went missing.

 Subtitles by explosiveskull The DNA from a kid that's been missing for 20 years suddenly turns up at a crime scene. Are you Jesse? - Are you gonna tell us your name now? - Joe Hanley. Unless you can come up with something inventive to charge him with, I'd like my client released. I'm chasing round town showing people photos of a dead woman. She's not a prossie. Her name wasn't Annie Green. She's called Selena. [Slade] We've all done things to survive and to cope. [Mark] Why would you do that?

 - He's my husband. - You said it was over. - [knocks] - [muffled gunshot] I was held in a room with the other girls. [frenzied screams] The guy who took her... I helped him. You are a victim. Any idea where this house was? I could see a building, shaped like an upside-down umbrella. Jay Newman? Do you mind if we ask you a few questions? - Feel free to have a look around. - [Ally] You're still suspicious? ♪ You know love ♪ ♪ Makes the world go round ♪ ♪ And love ♪

[muffled screams] - [man] Come on! - [girl] Help! [muffled scream, boot closes] [thudding from the boot of the car] [Danny] Right so, if Annie Green is really Selena Callaway, then, yeah, we need to check that out. It's important. If she was lying, it might connect her to Jesse. Yeah, yeah, possibly. I'd say it was crucial, wouldn't you? Mate... I'm gonna get it done. All right? As soon as I know anything, you're gonna know it. - OK. See you. - All right. [Danny] Oh, Cal. Cal. Have you checked that place out yet? Come on, man. Jay Newman's? Tried to get a warrant. Apparently, we haven't got enough evidence. Whoa. You're going in, though, right? We'll have another look, as soon as I've sorted the crap on my desk. - Sorry. Barry? - [Liam] Danny? The age-progression image of Jesse Wells and Joe Hanley's custody photo. - Yeah. I've seen them. - Well, you two saw him in the flesh. [Liam] What do you think? Maybe. Maybe not. [Liam] Ah, well, that's helpful. OK. Go to Hanley's place and get in his face. If he plays silly buggers, arrest him. Take some back-up. Oh, Liam. There is one other thing. I want to follow up on a lead. There's a... a source... that thinks that the murdered woman that we found is not Annie Green. She's really called Selena Callaway. - OK. Carry on. I'll get Mickey on it. - All right. Cheers. Mickey... Mickey! [sighs] Anything familiar, Brit? I think it's a left here. Left? Left it is. I don't know what to say. Well, it's very simple. Just say yes. A partnership? Our patients like you very much. Nothing but praise with the online feedback. Well, apart from Mrs Harrison, but she's a cross we've all had to bear. It's great. It's... It's amazing. - I'm shocked. - [Dr Khan] Well, don't be. You've been with us two years now? It's the natural next step. Have a look at this agreement. It's pretty standard stuff. I'm sure you'll want your solicitor to give it the once-over before you say yes. Wow. Thank you. Thank you, Dr Khan. That's brilliant news. Thank you. My pleasure. [Ally] We'll get more out of him without that bloody lawyer by his side. [Danny] Just make sure he doesn't run out. Check round the back. Who says crime doesn't pay? [knock at door] [Danny] DS Kenwood. We're looking for Joe Hanley. That's me. Sorry. Never seen him before in my life. [Danny] Well, you have to admit, it is a bit strange that we arrest this guy and then he gives us your name. Maybe... I don't know. He made it up. It's a common enough surname around here. Or maybe I've... done his accounts and he just remembered it. Whatever, there's... obviously been some kind of mistake. [Danny] Yeah. Must be. I mean... you're not the guy we interviewed. And you're sure you don't know him? Sorry. I'm as in the dark as you are. All right. Well, thank you. Oh, actually, before I go, can I just ask you one more thing? Sure. Do you recognise this woman? Jesus. She was beaten to death. A week ago. She's the... I know her. We had sex. [exhales] [Joe] They threatened my family. I've got a daughter. I had no choice but to go along with it. You could have come to us - the police. [Joe] They had some information on me. Things have been a bit tricky in the marriage. You know how it is. And somehow they found out. You were seeing an escort and they used that to blackmail you for your identity. I just thought it was going to be a credit-card thing. Fraud. Small time. - I didn't even know her name. - Selena Callaway. [Joe] Selena. - Right. - [door opens] [girl] Dad! What's going on? - What happens now? - We'll be in touch. - [Ally] Do you believe him? - [Danny] Yeah. Smells right. But we should check him out, make sure he's telling the truth. Assuming he is the real Joe Hanley, who the hell did we arrest? Are we close? I don't know. It all looks the same. [Slade] Danny said something about an upside-down umbrella. It's got to be around here. [Brit] Excuse me. - Run. - What? [muffled screams] You tried to warn her. - I saw you. - No, I didn't. I promise. [scream echoes] - [breathes heavily] - Hey. [Slade] Hey, hey, hey. [Slade] Is this it? Is this the one, Brit? Are you sure? I can't. I'm sorry. Hey, Brit. Hi. Yeah, it's me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Call off the search. He's just walked back in. Of course. Of course I'll tell him how worried you were. I've been gone for less than an hour. The phones have been going crazy. I've literally been up to here. I'm really sorry, Larry, but that top just isn't working for me. - Seriously? - Yeah. Fashion advice from the man who owns a Homer Simpson tie? - Hey! - And wears it. That tie was a gift from my mum. One word: car boot sale. Yeah. He walked in about an hour ago. He insists on seeing you. I told him he needs an appointment, but, for some reason, he didn't take me seriously. Really? Can't believe it. Hello. I'm Mark. How can I help you? My father's gone missing. [Simon] Before we start, you should know I have mild Asperger's Syndrome. I am very comfortable with the label, it's just that some people can find me too direct. Well, I'll bear that in mind. How did you find me again? You know my mother. I assume you did some work for her. She had one of your business cards in her handbag. Your website said "Wells Solicitors", but also claims you "find missing people". Right. We do. Yeah. Your mother is...? Laura Marshall. - You said it was over. - It was. [Mark] So what was Kenton doing here? Who cheats on their lover with their husband? I'm Simon Marshall. [Mark] OK. I'm still a little bit confused. If your father is really missing, how come Laura, your mum... how come she hasn't gone to the police? I don't know. But there is definitely something wrong. She says he's away with the school, some management-training thing. But I am the one who organises his school calendar. Not her. OK. Well... I still don't quite understand how this is suspicious. Well, if his plans changed, he would have asked me to update his diary. So are you like his secretary, then? I prefer "personal assistant", thank you very much. That's very good. Much better. Personal assistant. OK. Well... I think I can help, but I should probably try and speak to your mum, too, to try and get to the bottom of this. I'd rather we both work here. - OK. - I find her a massive distraction. She keeps offering me sandwiches. Right. Of course. I understand. I understand, but I need to try and gather all the relevant data. Cause maybe your mum holds some vital clues that even she is unaware of. An unknown known? Exactly. [woman over radio] F-3-0-2-3-7. Deceased adult male found at 2 Manville Avenue. Requesting assistance. You know whose address that is. [siren wails] All right. Go out the front. Keep the punters off the grass. [Danny] No dogs. Remember? It bugged me then. [Danny] Something didn't feel right. So, what happened here? [Danny] He gets murdered the day after we come round? What did we miss? [taps window] [dull thud] [Ally] What are you doing in here, if the body is in the other room? Doesn't glass reflect sound? Why would you put an extra mirror in here? I don't know. [Danny] And a chair facing it. So you sit here. You admire your reflection. A big guy, a big ego. Oh, my God! [screaming] [girls screaming] Help! OK. Our three girls are Sasha Manley, Jane Shilling and Izzy Allan. They'll interview once the psychologists have cleared them. Tomorrow at the earliest. We know they were chained up, so who killed this Newman guy? Have we got any idea how long they were down there? One bloody day is a day too long. And there's nothing on that CCTV? It's set up to view not record. I can't believe I walked away from this. It smelt wrong and I walked away. The big picture is that they're walking free and the bad guy has a tag on his toe. He could be alive and talking if we'd been quicker. - We tried to get a warrant. - You said you were checking it out. All right. Let's just keep it professional. All right? Cal, what do we have? Here's what we have from the original files. The oldest is Jane Shilling. [Cal] Last seen outside a museum in Westbridge in 2011. Wait. That's five years ago. How old was she when she was abducted? Nineteen. Her parents reported her missing. They've been told. And the others? Opening up, but we're taking it slow. And we're digging up the yard. Well, it's gonna be a great, big media shit storm. So let's keep our heads down and get on with it. - Cal? - I'm on it. OK, Dempsey and Makepeace, tell me about the real Joe Hanley. A chartered accountant and clean as a whistle. Other than his escort habit. Affairs are cheaper. So I've heard. So what is it? ID theft? Yeah, with a side order of blackmail. Keeps him quiet, while the crooks get busy. Drain their account, set up new ones. - Where does Selena Callaway fit in? - [Danny] Part of the scam. Maybe she lost her nerve, threatened to call the police. Paid the price. OK. Check her place. See what you can find. OK. Back to work, people. You found me. Helps that you're a creature of habit, Brit. I freaked out. Yeah, I kinda figured that one out. No one's blaming you. - Are you sure about that? - You're a victim. I helped him. - No. He did that to you, too. - No, I helped him. Ssh, ssh, ssh. Come on. Well... your chest sounds clear as a bell, Mrs Harrison. My infections are invariably bacterial in nature. Dr Khan recommends amoxicillin. If you wish, I can discuss the case with her. It's not really as simple as that. [mobile phone rings] I'm so sorry about this. One moment. Hi. I really need your help. I'm in the middle of seeing a patient. It's Britnay. I'm really worried about her. Now is a really bad time. I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important. Don't make me beg. Pru, please? My dignity is all I've got left. [sighs] OK. I'll see you in the shelter in 20 minutes. OK. Thanks. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come to the door! Hi, Mum. I need to use the bathroom. - Hi. - Hey. I don't want to talk to you. That's fine. We'll just... We'll just sit here. You're a pretty shit doctor. I know. But, luckily, you are the only one that has ever noticed. [phone keypad tapping] I didn't want to go back there. But he persuaded you. Right? [Pru] Well, if it's any consolation, you're not the first. It was the same when we were kids. He'd have these big ideas. Then, when the shit hit the fan, he'd be nowhere to be seen. It's not his fault. He just... He wants to help people and... some people just can't be helped. I don't believe that. Thank you for bringing him home. He can be a little challenging. Yeah. Yeah, no, he explained all that. He was very funny, actually. Simon doesn't buy the training course. God knows why. It's true. He's probably falling backwards into a deputy head's arms right now. So definitely not abducted by aliens, then? Cause I was about to start wearing my underpants over my trousers. That won't be necessary. Thank God. No. We're in contact. Everything's fine. Really, we're fine. Right, I'd better get back to work. Thanks for this. It's all part of the ex-lover service. It's really good to see you. Simon needs a father. He needs his routine. Everything has to be simple and straightforward. - Efficient. - Otherwise, he can't cope. And then none of us can. Thanks for the coffee. I'm gonna head off. Mark! - Hey, Slade. - Yeah? I can't believe you took her back to that place. What happened? I was trying to see if she remembered something if we went back there. Well, you were right about that. Look, she... hides it well, but... she'd follow you anywhere. I have that effect on a lot of people, Pru. I think it's my aftershave. I should get back. Listen... Maybe we should make this a regular thing. It's good to have a doctor in the house. - You want me to work here? - No, no, no. It would strictly be on a volunteer basis. Why would I do that? Well, today, you abandoned your private clinic and drove halfway across the city. Was that just because I asked you to? Maybe I'm just a sucker. Or maybe... you see people that deserve your help. You are so simple. - I think so. - Bye, Slade. [landlord] I saw it on the news, but I didn't realise Selena was the woman found dead in that hotel. Thank you. Shouldn't we wait for the crime-scene manager? I'm wearing my Marigolds, aren't I? [Ally] Mmm. - Hello. - Cats are evil. Danny... meet Skittles. Pure evil. [|Ally] I wonder who's been feeding him. [Danny] If you could just focus on trying to find clues, that'd be great. Thanks. [Ally] It's a nice place. She worked as an IT consultant for Porter & Starr, so maybe there's something on a laptop or a tablet or something. A daughter? Yeah. Looks like it. At least we've got the right person this time. I'm going to check the bedrooms. Uhh! Uhh... [coughs] Ally! [Ally] I'm calling it in! [siren wails] Police! Police! Move! Move! Out of the way! Police! Move! Move! Out of the way! Stop! Police! [Danny] Stop him! Police! [Danny] Stop him! [crowd gasps] Whoa! What are you doing? I said stop him, not kill him. Someone call an ambulance! [monitor beeps] - [Ally] Do you think he's Jesse? - I don't know. Hey, doc! Doctor? Can I...? So... Was there anything from that scan that you were talking about? There's no bleed, but the cerebral contusion is significant. We'll be keeping him asleep for the time being, monitoring intracerebral pressure. Sorry... And then he'll wake up? Perhaps. [doctor] Once the sedation is lifted, all outcomes are possible. Do you have any identification? Because if this man has any family, they need to be informed. If we end up having to switch him off, it helps to have asked permission first. And you think it could be him? I don't know. We've sent the DNA. We're getting it fast-tracked. It's definitely the guy we interviewed. It's just through here. Just give me a minute. All right? Go on, mate. Mark! I don't know. I thought, you know... either way... - I'm really sorry. - It's been a long time. [Mark] I'm sorry. I just don't know. Christ. What did the doctor say? That's why you called me. He's gonna die, isn't he? They asked about family. [Mark] My parents should see him. Look, I don't think that's a great idea. Not yet. Their son is dying in a hospital bed. They've got a right to know. I can't OK that. All right? You're not even supposed to be in here. If you're not 100 per cent sure, let's just wait for the DNA result. - Special privileges, then? - Sorry about that. [Danny] I just wanted him to have a look. It's fine. - And the girls from the Newman place? - Still with the psychologists. Gonna be at least another 24 hours before we can even speak to them. Did we get anything from Selena Callaway's laptop? Freshly spring-cleaned by our intruder. - Why not just destroy it? - What's more suspicious? A missing laptop or one filled with cat pictures and Facebook updates? Which means there was something worth finding and now it's gone. So we're back to where we started. You're a man. Do you back up your computer? Sometimes. Maybe. - No. - Well, I do. Every day. I'm not sure I can do this. Is it him? Just tell me. Mum, I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't want to. We've come this far, we can do this together. Come on. - What if it's him? - Then we'll know. Both of us. - OK? - OK. [sighs] Mum? He's someone's son. But not mine. You're sure? This isn't Jesse. Let's get out of here. You were right. A bespoke cloud back-up system. A server on the dark web. I knew she'd come in useful someday. [woman] This means all her files are saved remotely. - We just have to access them. - If we just had her password. [woman] Shouldn't be too hard to overwrite. [types] We won't know for sure until we get the DNA. - She'd know, believe me. - OK. Even so... Do you think there's a day when she hasn't imagined what he looks like now? She'd know Jesse the same way she'd know you. The same way as I would. When you have children, you'll understand. I'm taking her home. [Alan] I shouldn't have let him persuade me. I'm sorry. He has hope, Alan. And so do I. Maybe it's time you let some hope back in. Hm? And we're in. [Ally] It's all names on individual files. Do you recognise anything? There. Joseph Michael Hanley. God, there are so many names. [Ally] This was a huge operation. What's that clock thing do? [woman] It looks like an automatic delete setting. - Do something. - Any ideas? [rapid bleeping] I can't stop it. Watch out. [Stuart] Cheers. I still have to approve the contract. They love you. Obviously, like me, they have excellent taste. [TV volume on low] You know, this move, the whole home-coming thing, I thought it was a mistake. Move on. Never look back. Shark philosophy. But this? This is the real thing. You keep this up and I can retire. I always wanted to be a house husband. The police have not made any official statement, but first reports suggest the kidnappings could be on a scale with notorious cases in Austria and the United States. There are unconfirmed reports of a man's body being removed from the record producer Jay Newman's home. [Karl] Hey, Ally. Do you want to see something weird? If it's on your phone and it involves sex, cars or extreme weather, then no. Ouch, Ally. It's actually way better than that. Ken told me to give you this result. Priority One. Fast-tracked. Guess whose DNA was found at the Newman scene? A microscopic blood splatter on the shirt. - Jesse Wells. - Bingo. Finding Jesse's DNA at one crime scene could be contamination. But two? Yeah, but why Jay Newman? He's got zero connection to Hanley. [Ally] Unless we're missing something. This time, we've got blood on the shirt. Direct contact. A fight? - Meaning Jesse killed him? - But why? Right now... a zombie vigilante makes the most sense. [text alert] Oh, shit. I'd forgotten I'm supposed to meet Mark. Here. Wait. You're not going to tell him, are you? No. Of course not. [Danny] What the hell is this place? It's on trend, hip, cool. All words you may recognise. Uh-huh. And this is what a £12.99 Bundy Burger looks like, is it? Yeah. Well, it's on you. Let's face it, you owe me after that little stunt at the hospital. Your mum was sure. Yeah? Not him. 100 per cent. I suppose you've already sent off the DNA. - [mobile phone buzzes] - Yeah. - Take it, if you want. - No, it's OK. It's a client. Actually, it's Laura's son. - He thinks his dad's gone missing. - Mm-hm? I know they're having troubles. Just reading between the lines. Not that that's any interest to you. That's a leading question. No comment. Oh. Organic ketchup. Of course. Even the condiments have beards! What's wrong with eating at your dad's place? [sighs] Mate, he doesn't think we should even be looking for Jesse. Your son's DNA turns up after 20 years. Got to be a hard thing to get your head around. Whether you agree with it or not, you've got to respect that. [laughter] Oh, good job, man. [mobile phone buzzes] Oh, it's Pru. Yeah, look, I should probably get going myself. I need to check up on our mystery man. Say hi to Pru. [Mark] Pru. You want to get some Heinz, mate. [Ally] Fuck. Yeah. All right. Thanks. Danny, the confirmation has just come through. Our mystery man's DNA doesn't match that of Jesse Wells and it's not on the database, either. Great. - So who have we got in there? - I don't know. Shit. [monitor beeps] Hanley's a dead end. Selena's given us three names and a screen grab. There's the girls from Newman's place when they're ready to talk. - Maybe one of them killed him. - Yeah, but why now? It's too much of a coincidence. - Jesse's DNA is at that murder scene. - What does that mean? Has he got a connection with Newman? What if Jesse's abducted, he escapes, he comes back to finish off the job? This must be tough on you. Is this guy even able to speak to us? Yeah. The doctors said he's recovered some since lifting the sedation. Maybe I'll just ask him who he is. - Nicely. - Yeah, of course. [Pru] God, Mark, being back in this place, it's... I don't know. [Mark] I go running here every day. - Really? - Every day. I still look for him. It's weird, isn't it? Even though my brain is telling me that it can't be true, a part of me just still looks. The head knows, but the heart won't get the message. I never understood before, that desire, that need to have a body. But it's true. You know, you need... You need to know, one way or another. So, the clinic just offered me a partnership. Congratulations. And, today, I ducked out to help Slade. One of the kids. And now he wants me to work at the shelter, like a team medic. - Right. - An unqualified shrink. Well, he thinks I need help. Morally. [laughs] You'd better pack your bags, cause you are going on a guilt trip. I'm telling you, he gets everyone in the end. - Do you think it's dumb? - It's a really good idea. Never take career advice from a bleeding heart. [wry laugh] Do you ever wonder about the choices you make? The ones that screw everything up? Well, "self-destruction" is my middle name. I just can't fit it into my business cards! [Pru laughs] - Oh, look. - God, you remember? - Remember when it was like that? - Yeah. Four kids versus the rest of the world. Everything was so simple, wasn't it? [Mark] You're either with us or you're against us. The band. Do you remember the band? Oh, my God, what was it called? - The one we were gonna form. - Synthetic Execution. Right? [laughs] Oh, shit, what happened to the band? Well, whatever happens to everyone's bands. Right? Life. Or the singer keeps on insisting on playing bloody bass. Bullshit. Slade kept quitting, remember? There was something about musical differences. I don't know. We were clearly witnessing the birth of a human enigma. - That's what was happening. - Or he was doing it for attention. Hey. Maybe he deserves it. Always on his side. It's the eternal bromance. [children's laughter echoes] Do you trust him? Slade. Yeah, I trust him with my life. Why? - Pru? - No, it's nothing. [Mark] Well, no, it clearly is something. What is it? Pru? Can you tell me, please? That day... that we lost Jesse, we didn't tell you the truth. Well, not all of it. [sighs] Slade and I were here. We were on our own, so no one could see us. I remember you said you'd gone to the shops. No, Mark. [Pru] We were... together. We were trying to work out a way of telling you. Pru, is that it? Oh, God. Whatever. We were kids. It's a long time ago. Mark. We saw him. After he'd gone off... Slade and I saw Jesse. [Pru] We thought he was spying on us. Jesse? Jesse, come here! [Pru] So Slade chased him, because he didn't want him to tell you. I don't understand what you're saying, why you haven't told me. - [Pru] We were scared. - Jesse! Slade didn't want you to find out about us. He was your best friend. - What are we gonna do? - We tell no one. But you both saw Jesse. [young Slade] Jesse! You both saw Jesse before the last sighting. What if the witnesses didn't see him with Marosi? Do you really think that could have happened? I don't know, Pru. But what if his confessions were all lies? That changes everything, doesn't it? That means that Jesse could have gone south, not west. That... That means that our timeline is all wrong. We'd already lied to the police. Marosi had done his confession. - Would it have changed anything? - You should have told me! No, I know and I'm so sorry, Mark. I'm so sorry. Who else is lying about that day, Mark?
