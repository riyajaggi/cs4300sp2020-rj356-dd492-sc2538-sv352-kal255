 Subtitles by explosiveskull My brother went missing when he was five years old. Never seen him since. There's a case that I'm working on, and er... They found blood, but it's not the victim's. The DNA, it's Jesse. He's alive. - We're gonna get our boy back. - It's a mistake. - So you're saying he's a murderer? - Nobody knows. Don't you think there's someone else we should tell, someone who was with us that day? - Pru. - How long's it been? - 16 years. - Here we are.

 The four of us grown up. This is my husband Stuart. He's a workaholic. - I really missed you, over the years. - Me, too. I'm here to help you. - I run a shelter for runaways. - What's the story? - She disappeared five years ago. - Were you held against your will? I'm not the only one. There are more. Make sure she's OK, help her settle in. Where is she? Hey, Brit! Got a trace on the mobile from the murdered woman. Name's Annie Green. Are you Jesse? We call this the Platinum Hall. You want to know the great myth about creativity?

 The big lie they always tell you: "It has to take time. It has to be slaved over." When I wrote "Lucky Girl" for Belinda, I forgot she was coming. She turned up on Tuesday. I thought she was coming on a Wednesday, so I told her to go and get a coffee. I went into the studio and I wrote the lyrics. They took me five minutes. ♪ Lucky boy came into my world ♪ ♪ Lucky boy made everything swirl ♪ ♪ I-I-I-I ♪ ♪ I'm a lucky girl ♪ This... is where the magic happens. I've found my new magician. The neighbours don't complain, with all this noise going on? - Dad! - It's totally soundproofed. Make as much noise in here as you like and nobody can hear a thing. Just watch this. Voilà. Real, real pleasure. Thank you, Dad. She's in good hands, don't you worry about her. Take care. I'll see you very soon in there. All right. Take care. So, Annie Green's mobile is registered to an address that doesn't exist anymore, got ripped down a couple of years back. - Knocked down. - Totally erased. That's helpful. Where are they sending the bills? A shrug - that's what you've got for me? Hey, I'm on it. Don't touch the suit. Danny. Hey. Sorry for calling so early. We've made an arrest in the murder enquiry. We traced a mobile that was stolen at the scene. When we went to locate it, a man did a runner. - Is it him? - Nah. He won't talk till he gets a solicitor. We asked his name, he said it was Hugh. Fuck Hugh. What does he look like? Does he look like Jesse? Mark, the last time I saw him, he was five. OK, well, is he the right age? - Danny? - Yeah. What's his hair colour? Does he... Does he have any freckles? Come on, man. We ran his prints and they came back clean. So he has no criminal record, but we won't release him till we know. - I'm going to come down there. - No, Mark... let us interview him. I need to keep personal and professional apart. - He's my brother, Danny. - Mark, please, stay home. I'll call you as soon as I know anything. Don't tell your mum. She's calling me ten times a day as it is. They've made an arrest. Could be Jesse, could not be. We're just going to have to sit tight. Let me guess whether you're going to do that. It could be Jesse, Dad. Does that not interest you? I'll make the coffee to go. Jesse! So, are you gonna tell us your name now... Hugh? Joe Hanley. OK. So, Joe... have you ever changed your name? - Changed my name? - Yeah, when you were born. Were you born as someone else, someone who isn't Joe Hanley? No. Have you lived round here long? - Or... - All my life, on and off. On and off? Yeah, I mean, I travelled, I went to uni. Sorry, why is he asking this? My client wants to know why you're asking that. It relates to a murder enquiry. I'd advise your client to answer the question. You should answer that. I've answered it. On and off. What are the names of your mother and father? What? Sorry, you think I nicked a phone, which I didn't. What have my mum and dad got to do with it? Do you want to ask him? - My client wants... - I heard. Dorothy and James. All right. OK, let's talk about this phone. Can you tell us how this iPhone 5, registered to a Miss Annie Green, came into your possession? - I found it. - You found it. Where? - At a Lebanese restaurant. - Did you tell anyone you found it? - No. - Nah. So, basically, you stole it. Look, I've obviously wandered into something here. You're telling me this phone's linked to a murder. I don't know anything about that. I picked up a phone, turned it on to see who it belonged to. I was about to return it, next thing you lot are outside the restaurant. Yeah, well, we came to ask you some questions. But before we could do that, you kind of ran off and then hit my partner in the face. And it hurt. Hardly the behaviour of someone who's got nothing to hide, is it... Joe? Wouldn't you say? All right, all right. Look... the thing is, if you want the truth... I work for an accountancy firm. A big one - Hanson and Finch. If I get done for theft, that's my job down the drain. OK? For a stupid mistake, I'm facing the abyss. Yeah. Yeah, it was crazy, but I was scared. I'm still scared because now you think I'm wrapped up in a murder. This is a living hell. So you wouldn't mind giving us a DNA sample? I want my proper brief. Yeah? Oh, hi. Hi. Sorry, I'll be one sec. OK? I haven't seen you for years, then, all of a sudden, you can't keep away from me. Well, I was worried about her. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you make your excuses. How is she? Well, physically, I mean, she'll be fine, but... Slade, we have to tell her parents. They have a right to know. - Is that what she wants? - What, to go home? I think she trusts me. She's started to speak a little. Saying what? Not much, but she's scared, she can't sleep, afraid someone's gonna come and get her. She said something about being chained to a wall. She has to be home. Somewhere she knows she's safe. All right, yeah. OK, I can sort that out, but... ask her, make sure that's what she wants. A lot of the kids I deal with here, their problems start at home. They hate home, OK? That's not safety. OK, I'll leave you to it. Oh, hang on. Erm... have you noticed she's got these marks on her neck, like these freaky little vampire bites? - Yeah, I've noticed. - What is that? It's worrying. Have you seen Britnay? Not recently. Right. He's a man who made a mistake and his first call is to Dean Frankell. He says he works for Hanson and Finch. Could be big money. He'll need it. That guy charges by the nanosecond. - I take it he's got a reputation. - They call him The Weasel. He's small, but extremely aggressive. And he goes for the jugular. I've had a few by this point, eight, nine pints. I look at her and say, "Excuse me, is your dad a baker? Cause you have..." - Are you busy, chaps? - Oh, always. Hey, Ally. Are you trying to get me fired? What do you think? I-I-I need more time. So... have you had a look? Jesse's eyes were brown like chocolate buttons. His are kind of muddy. We're erm... I've ordered an age progression photo for Jesse. But what would really help is if we had some photos of you at the age that Jesse would be now. Do you reckon you could dig some out for us? Is that the murder victim? Yeah. It's a woman called Annie Green. We think she's possibly a prostitute. - Is that all you know? - Yeah. So, Jesse could have been with her, then, in the hotel. He could have been screwing a hooker. Yeah, I mean, there are all kinds of possibilities. Most obvious being that he's a murderer. Or that this whole thing's a mistake. Jesse's what I think he is, he's dead. Alan, wait. Wait, wait, wait. Let me just check the coast is clear. The night the murder took place, Wednesday 15th April, my client was at a work function - an accountancy dinner. The event which took place at the Gramercy Hotel, Farringdon Lane, was very well attended. I'm sure you won't have any trouble finding any number of people more than happy to provide a rock solid alibi. - We'll check. - Do. - We will. - Good. However, there is another issue, and it concerns my client's arrest. I'm listening. My client claims that he was assaulted during the arrest, dragged to the floor and spat on. - He elbowed me in the face. - In self-defence. - He was in fear of his life. - Bullshit! - He knew we were the police! - Ally. My understanding is that the purpose of the arrest was to ascertain how my client acquired the mobile telephone, not the arrest of a murder suspect. So, if you didn't have an arrest warrant, which you didn't, and you didn't have reasonable suspicion that my client was the perpetrator of the murder, which you didn't, why, may I ask, did you send seven police officers to arrest him, and then assault him in the street? Unless you can come up with something inventive to charge him with, I'd like my client released... P.D.Q. Slade, isn't this a bit gruesome? Oh, they're not babies, Pru. They've seen worse than this. I promise you that. Right, then. Are you OK? - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? Whose idea do you think this was? Take those, pass them round, they're not the nicest photo, I know. Her name is Annie Green. Take a good look, please. So, if any of you recognise her, any information would be useful. - And she worked the streets? - Yeah, we think so, yeah. Are you a cop? - Oi, cloth ears, I've told you. - I'm not, I'm a lawyer. - Why are you doing cop work? - It's about his brother, you see. We're just trying to find out more about her. So, if any of you recognise her. Listen, we're not going to go to the police or give your names out. This is strictly between these walls. OK? No? OK. Worth a shot. - Slade? - Yeah? They're here. Right. You get Gemma. I'll get the parents. Sure. Remember, she hasn't seen her parents in five years. I'll be here... be here with you the whole time. OK? - You'll get your moment. - Course you will. Right, I'd better be off. I hope she's gonna be OK. - Right, see you later. - Bye. Bye-bye. Look, we should go for another drink some time. - Yeah, I'd love that. - Yeah. Me too. - All three of us. - Yeah, yeah, that'd be great. - Bye. - See you later. Bye. She doesn't want me there. She's not a prossie. Do you know her? No, I don't know her. But I've seen her. She gets coffee from Starbucks on Raylan Street. I used to graft there sometimes. She was a good giver. It doesn't mean she wasn't a prostitute cause she was a good tipper, right? She was a smart dresser. No way was she a whore. She wasn't dressed smart when they found her. - And her name wasn't Annie Green. - OK. You know her name? She's called Selena. - How do you know that? - They write it on the cup. And my guess is she lived in the apartments opposite because that's where she would always head back towards. - Selena. - OK. - OK. - And... that information has got to be worth a donation. Sure. - Here you are, mate. - Thank you. That's the poshest homeless kid I've ever seen. You should go and check that out. Mark Wells Solicitors. How may I help? - Hey, Larry. - Hello, stranger. You have a million messages. When will you be in? I need some information on a woman called Selena Callaway. - Selena or Serena? - Selena with an L. Selena with an L. OK, there's a Selena Callaway that works at Porter & Starr. IT consultants. There's also a link to her boss. A guy called Nigel Freeman. Want me to email the address? - Yeah, do it. - OK, Bye. - Where is she? - Just look after her. Brit! Hi, you've reached Britnay's voicemail. Leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you. Bye. Brit, it's me. Listen, you know my philosophy about running away from your problems. Don't you? They're like elite athletes. They've got sponsorship deals with Nike and they'll catch you in the end. So... whatever it is, we're better facing it. Take some time, if you like, but, please, call me. OK? Julie. Update me. Are you any closer to finding him? Julie, Julie, you can't keep calling me like this. You'll know, the moment I get any information. Am I an inconvenience, Danny? He's my son. My son. And you were there. We are linked by this. If I want to call you a hundred times a day, I'll call you a hundred times a day. You're such an amateur. I can get you in there, no problem. - You'd get me past security? - Simple. - How? - Trust me. What am I doing? I'm chasing round town, showing people photos of a dead woman. I'm... I'm losing my mind. You're just trying to get some answers, that's all. It's obsessing me. Jesse, he's everywhere I look. Is that him? Is that him? I'd find it worrying if it didn't obsess you. I guess. But... I keep on having this thought. Erm... that if Jesse does turn out to be a murderer... would I rather if he was dead? Group hug? - We're not in America now. - Get that down you, then. I'm here, I'm here. Leave me alone. Slade, what are we going to do? Suppose Jesse tells? He won't. I'll make sure of it. And neither will we. We tell no one. OK? Oh! - Hello? - Hi, it's Gemma. I'm sorry to call. No, no. That's why I gave you my number. Can we meet right away? You have one new message. Hi, Slade, it's me. Thanks for your message. You were right, as ever. I've done a lot of thinking and decided how to deal with it. Love you. Bye. Hi, Slade, it's me. Thanks for your message. You were right, as ever. I've done a lot of thinking and decided how to deal with it. Love you. Bye. Britnay! I thought you'd done something stupid, Brit. I'm sorry. Do you want to know who kidnapped Gemma? I did. The reason I ran the other night, when I saw Gemma... Because I recognised her. The guy who took her... the guy who held her captive... I helped him. I was held... in a room with the other girls. A big house. He... only let me out at night. He put a... dog collar round my neck. Some kind of electric one. It would... Shock us... if we did things he didn't like. The marks. He always had a favourite. A girl he would take out with him. What do you mean, take out? That's how he'd capture his victims. He always had a girl with him when he approached them. You're more likely to trust a man when he's with a girl, aren't you? That's how he caught me. Did you know who this man was? What did he look like? Fat. Chubby. Flash clothes. He used to sing. I was so happy to get out. He let me talk to this girl and make friends with her. I felt like me again for the first time in... He grabbed her. Did you have any idea where the house was? I could see a shadow in the yard. A building... shaped like a... an upside-down umbrella. I think the house had a swing set. Rusted, kind of old. It made a... It made a creaking noise when it moved. Next time I said I didn't want to do it. I said I didn't want anyone else to get hurt, but... he hurt me until I agreed. Even then I tried to warn her. But it was too late. He started taking me out. He'd drive to a beauty spot. Somewhere remote. Set up a picnic. It was like a date or something and then he'd... Every day. I hate myself for what I've done. Because no matter what I do... no matter who I help... it's never going to erase what I did. I knew the hardest part would be getting out of the car, but if I made it out... I didn't know where I was. I just knew I had to get away from him. And thank God Slade saved me. We've all done things... to survive and to cope, all of us. And you went through hell and you are a victim. OK? Then why doesn't it feel like it? Gemma, I know you're scared. I've got a friend, Danny, and we can trust him. And if I come with you, will you just talk to him and tell him what you've told me? Because this man needs to be caught. OK? For the sake of the others. And I'll be with you. I'll be with you, Gemma. This is massive. You should have come to me straight away. She didn't want that. I'm going to go to my boss. We'll get a team assembled. Look, I brought her to you because I promised her that she could trust you. I'm going to get someone to help. Pru... Pru, this is serious. What about the house? Do you think they'll find it? Upside-down umbrella seems specific. Look, they'll do a search. A case like this, it'll be a priority. I'll do my best to keep across it. Obviously, there's been a mistake somewhere. - Mummy! - Hey, baby. A conference call to Miami. I'll be ten to 15. Let's go through them one by one. Hi. - Are you sure about this? - Just go with it. - It's not going to work. - You underestimate the word "rodents". Good morning, good morning. How are you? I got a call from a Nigel Freeman from Porter & Starr. Sounds like he's got our old friend, the Norwegian Black. - Thirteenth floor. - Thank you. Mr Freeman. - What's this all about? - Can we have a quick word? - Murdered? - Any grievances you knew about, any disagreements she had with someone? She was a normal woman. Well, as normal as anyone else. She liked to drink. She had a problem with the off-switch. She was good-looking. She attracted a lot of men. - Did she have a boyfriend? - She played around. But half the office does. She was on that site. The online... Er... Timber. - Tinder. - Yeah. I'm familiar with it. She was always looking at some guy's photo, deciding whether she would or she wouldn't. I thought the whole thing was rather primitive. - Sorry, no offence. - Non taken. Did she go on the site as herself, Selena Callaway, or did she have an alias? You know, a nom de plume, anything? So, the name Annie Green doesn't mean anything to you? Annie Green? What is it? Annie Green is my ex-fiancée. - My God, look at that! - Sshh! Bagels with cream cheese. Yours has got that chive shit in it. Five years, Ally. Held against their will. Are you all right? I don't know. DNA from a kid missing for 20 years suddenly turns up at a crime scene. And then a few days later, Gemma, who's been missing for five years, suddenly reappears. What are you saying, that the two are connected? I'm saying we shouldn't be sitting here, eating cream cheese bagels. How many, do you think? - What? - Girls? That Gemma, she said there were more. You hear those horror stories from America. And Switzerland. Girls just kept for years. What kind of man does that? OK. Hilary Clinton... Kiera Knightley, JK Rowling. That's easy. Kill. Kill slowly. Marry then kill. That way I'd get her money. Play properly. Look, I'm a married man with three kids, so I'd shag any of 'em. Danny, are you sure we should be doing this? What? Some of the lads are saying, and don't bite my head off, they're saying because your dad led the initial investigation into Jesse's disappearance... maybe you're out to prove something. They think wrong, then, don't they? What? - Stop the car. - What is it? Look, over there, behind the tree line. Upside-down umbrella. OK, let's split up. You go down there, I'll go down here. Remember, we're looking for a swing set. OK. - Jesus! - Having fun? Did you do that on purpose? You just took a year off my life. Security cameras. Locked passage gate. Swing set. Right, let's go round the front, see if anyone's in. Hello? Hi! Sorry to disturb you. We're police. DS Kenwood, DC Caine. - Mind if we ask about your neighbour? - About him? - Yeah, do you know him? - He's my neighbour. Why? - Do you know his name? - What's he done? Oh, we're just following up a lead. His name's Jay Newman. He's a music producer, or used to be. Had a hit way back with "Lucky Girl". Belinda Salt? You're too young to remember, but you should. It's: ♪ Lucky boy ♪ ♪ Came into my world ♪ ♪ Lucky boy, made everything swirl ♪ ♪ I-I-I ♪ ♪ I'm a lucky girl ♪ - No, I don't know it. - It was massive. - Probably paid for this place. - I really don't. It had this mad synth section halfway through. You haven't noticed anything suspicious? To be honest, I rarely see him. He doesn't go out much. He even walks his dogs in the yard at night. He doesn't take 'em out properly, which I think is cruel, but... - OK, well, thank you. - He's not a pedo, is he? You'd tell me if he was a pedo? You have nothing to worry about, really. Thank you. I'm going to have that song in my head all day now. It sounds terrific. I must buy a copy. What? For your gramophone? - What? - You mean, download it. It was a glib remark, Ally. I didn't realise it had to be contemporary. We should get a warrant. Especially after that balls-up with Hanley. You're probably right. Let's get it signed off. - Can I help you? - Jay Newman? The one and only. We're police. DS Kenwood, DC Caine. Do you mind if we come in, ask you a few questions? - Regarding? - Probably be better inside. Well, be my guests. Come on. We're looking into the disappearance of some local girls. Well, I can assure you the only girls that come through here are future recording artists. Feel free to have a look around. All you'll find is pop paraphernalia. Call it obsessive. We all have our things, don't we? Let me show you where the magic happens. Come with me. This... is the nerve centre. Let me show you something. Actually, you guys go in. I'll be right there. So, this is the recording booth. Mark, it's not a great time. Oh, OK. Look, I just want to tell you, you know the dead woman, Annie Green? Slade and I have done a bit of digging. Digging? Oh, great. So, when did you two become cops? Or have you just set up as a pair of private dicks? Completely sound proof. - So, you know the song? - Erm... Actually, we got a lead from the shelter. One thing just led to another. But I think we found something that you might want to know. OK. Meet me back at the station. I'll be there as soon as I can. ♪ Lucky boy came into my world ♪ ♪ Lucky boy made everything swirl ♪ Ally. Erm... you've got a swing set outside. - Have you got kids, or...? - No, no, it's for the artists. The security cameras make sense and the gates. I mean, all the recording gear he's got in there. We'll come back with a warrant. You're still suspicious? The house doesn't have a basement. Where would he keep them? Did you hear anything when we were in there? Any noises? - No, like what? - Like dogs barking, padding around? No. The whole house. No dog bowls, no dog food. No dog smell. That man does not keep dogs. So, why does his neighbour think he does? So, what are you saying? Gemma, she had those marks on her neck, remember? From a dog collar. Subtitles by explosiveskull
