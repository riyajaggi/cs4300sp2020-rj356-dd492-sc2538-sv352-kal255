 "I care enough to know that I could never love you." A cheesy line some guy would say. - What the hell does that mean? - It's romantic. Cause she says she cares enough to know that she'll never love him. But what does that mean? She's softening the blow. She doesn't really care for him at all. Right, but earlier, he's insulting her. He's saying, "You think you're smart. Stupid, stupid." No, no, he's not calling her stupid. It sounds like it. "You think you're smart. Stupid, stupid." He says "Right from the start when you knew we would part". [Mark] So she's too good for him. And they both know it. [Slade] Yeah. What he said! [laughter] He's going along with her because she's fit. You know, she's hot, she's sexy, she's gorgeous. He knows it's not gonna work but the sex is fantastic. And in the end, she cares enough to know she can never love him?

I've got no memory of anything after the bar. Well, we came back here and we drank a lot. And then... I just put you to bed. Did anything happen? I had a quick look down your top. - Other than that... - Oh, my God. I've really got to go! Please can you drive me home? No way, not in this state. I'll call you a cab. God, what am I gonna tell him? I don't dare turn my phone on. Please! Mark, please help me! All right. Jesus. [Alan] Morning. No explanations necessary, you're both consenting adults. - Will you drive me home? - Yeah. Bye. Come on. [text alert] Dad. [Danny tuts] [Danny] All right... Ooh, ooh, ooh! What is wrong with you? Watch your head. [sighs] Hi. - Mummy! - Hi, gorgeous. Hi, darling. Daddy says you've been on a sleepover. That's right. [Nico] Did you have a midnight feast? Absolutely. You've got to have a midnight feast on a sleepover. Which friend did you stay with? Erm... You don't really know them, darling. - Oh, can I have some of your cereal? - Yeah. Thank you. - Did you sleep with him? - No. - Did you want to? - No! So why end up at his place? Erm... I was pissed. I drank on an empty stomach, Stuart. He was being nice. Bullshit! Nice is bringing you home, nice is calling you a cab. Not taking you back to his place and trying to stick his tongue down your throat! That didn't happen. I'm sorry, Stuart, I messed up, OK? But if you want grovelling, then... - Grovelling? - I texted you! I texted you in the pub. I told you we were having drinks and I might be late. When I called, your phone was off. What am I supposed to think about that? I'm laying in bed awake. Hours passing by and still you're not here. - I called the hospitals. - You called the hospitals? When do you ever not come home? I thought something had happened to you. But by five in the morning, I knew. I knew you were somewhere you shouldn't be. I mean, an ex-boyfriend, Pru. What am I supposed to feel about that, huh? Put the shoe on the other foot for a second. I'm sorry. I messed up. But for one night, the old Pru reared her head. And it felt good. The old Pru? Which one's that? - The addict? The degenerate? - Screw you! Do you think this is me? The private GP? The status wife? And he makes you feel young and free again? Before the big bad world corrupted you. Well, boo-hoo! Grow up! You wouldn't understand. No, sure. I've never had those feelings. I wasn't this person. I've never been this person. But nothing happened. OK? Nothing happened. Moving back here was the worst thing we ever did! This is the place, Dad, look. Jesse Wells. Jesse. Mark's brother. Je... It's a missing child. It's Je... You investigated. Months and months and months on that case. Where are the files, Dad? I looked in the place they should be, that box: they're not there. Where are the files, Dad? [bleeping] [monitor bleeps more rapidly] [doctor] Sorry. [Slade] Mark, it's me. It's Britnay, she's dead. Someone killed her. I'm going away for a while. I just need some time. [Ally] The body that we found out at Newman's. We've got a match. It's a 58-year-old local man called Dr Aldus Croft. Well, he was a doctor till he was struck off. He's a convicted rapist. They think he's been buried there for about a year. And we've cross-checked the DNA with Jesse? - Yeah, there's no match. - OK. All right. Let me just get this straight. We thought that this body may have been Jesse/Gentle Hands. It's not, it's Croft. But that doesn't mean that Jesse couldn't still be Gentle Hands. - Right? - Right. We called Sasha and she corroborated with what Jane said. We need to show her the picture and see if she recognises him. [Jane] I don't really like going inside any more. It scares me. I'm sleeping in a caravan. This is the guy we found. Aldus Croft. [Ally] Is he the guy who... Er... Gentle Hands. Yeah. I remember his eyes. That's definitely him. Hi. That's terrible. [Pru] Oh, Britnay. For her to be in that place for all those years, and then for this to happen. Yeah, it's awful. What is going on, Mark? What are we all involved in? It scares me. Hello. Aw, thank you. - We'd better find your mum. - [woman] There you are. What have I told you? I've been looking everywhere. I should leave you. Better off without. Oh, you dare! Just you try it! Come on. Leave him alone. - You what? - I said, leave him alone. He's just a child, he's a little boy. What the hell do you think you're doing? You telling me how to deal with my own kid? Eh? Who are you? You interfering old bitch. You should be cherishing him, not dragging him around like some animal. That's your advice, is it? That's what you've got for me? That's good advice. Ohh! Mind your own business, you old bag. [groans] Hey, Slade, it's me. Listen, I hope you're OK, mate. It's a real shock to all of us. But if you need me, I'm here for you, OK? Take it easy, man. [Larry] Excuse me. You can't just walk in! Hello? Sorry, Stuart? Why do transvestites like Christmas? Cos they can eat, drink and be Mary. Boom-boom. Right. Sorry, Stuart, is there something you wanted? Shall we get some privacy? Sorry, Larry. Stuart, take a seat. I won't, thanks. Mark, you're an old friend of my wife's. A childhood sweetheart, maybe. Now you're reconnecting and enjoying it and that's great and wonderful. But if she contacts you again, I'd like you to do me a favour. Don't answer the call. Pru's been through some tough times, Mark, you may not know. But she needs stability, equilibrium. We're her oldest friends, Stuart. You are not part of her life any more. Have you heard what I've said, Mark? Because she's my wife. And I know what's best for her. I think you better go, mate. Would you like me to show this gentleman out? Yes, please, Larry. Don't answer her calls. Oh, Jesus Christ. [Alan] Julie. I'm OK. [Julie] Before you start fussing. - I've had worse. - When, in your street-fighting days? [groans] It was my fault. I slapped her. You slapped her? What did she say to you? - I was sticking my nose in. - [Alan] Quite literally. Julie. Just forget about it. Did he look like him? The kid? Did he look like Jesse? Not really. Same sort of age. Doesn't know how lucky she is. Bitch of a woman. Screaming at him... dragging his arm. Were we like that? - Did we take him for granted? - No. I mean, we drank too much, we were tired. Two young boys... short fuse. He was loved. He was loved. Then... Wham! This Payne guy attacks me, tells me to stay away. And where does this Payne guy work? Porter and Starr. These can't be coincidences. So I think, if I find out what the deal is with this Alexa Mills, then I'm gonna be able to get some answers about Jesse. Selena Callaway's daughter's called Alexa. We're looking for her. You know, Mark, when someone attacks you and tells you to stay away, there's usually a good reason for that. It means we're onto something, doesn't it? Look, you're upset about Britnay. You really think this is the time to be chasing after Jesse? You know, you might not like what you find. What does that mean? Danny, you're not telling me something. - Danny? - Mark... Don't lie to me, mate. I can tell by your face. You know what I need from you now? To leave this to the police. What is it? I need you and Slade to stop marching around town thinking... What is it? We found something. The studio where the girls were kept, Gemma and Britnay. We found traces of blood and it matches Jesse's DNA. [Mark] Listen, Larry... I'm not coming into the office today. I need to find out more about this Selena Callaway. I think she can lead me to Jesse. I was wondering if you know a woman called Selena Callaway. [camera shutter clicks] Tash? Mark, I'm Slade's friend. I work at the shelter sometimes. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen you with him. What are you doing down these parts? Looking for someone? Kind of. I'm looking for this woman. Selena. Well, you ain't gonna find her. She got murdered. Yeah, I know, yeah. What do you know about her? Selena was working for these guys. I'd seen them around, didn't like their faces. Some people give off vibes, you know? But in this game, if there's the offer of easy cash, people are all too willing. - And Selena was? - She was always short of cash. - Drug habit? - No. She thought she was better than us. Did some college course - computers. I guess that's how she got involved in the scam. What scam? - They were robbing people. - What do you mean? How? They set up some device that punters would log into, thinking it was free Wi-Fi. It stripped info from their phone. What kind of info? Like the fact that they pay money for sex, bank details, all sorts. She took me to the hotel they used. But I told her I wasn't interested. She's yelling at me: "You'd rather suck cock than earn real money!" But maybe it saved my life. So the hotel that they used... was that the same hotel that she was killed in? No. That was the strange thing. The scam ran out of a different place, the Old Town Hotel. The Old Town Hotel? Were they involved in the scam? You'd think so. It's a real dive, it has these themed rooms. They always used the Envy Room. - People like that shit. - The Envy Room? Listen... No offence, but you're costing me money. Sure. [baby crying] [gurgles] Will his tree grow as big as my tree? One day. When you're both bigger, they'll be as high as the house. [door slams] Oh, Julie. [Julie grunts] - I'm doing it. - Julie. You're right what you said. I have wasted all those years. Julie, no, just stop. Stop. Come here. Julie, no more. No more. I've wasted so much time. Why did it have to happen to us? Why us? Why not the bitch in the market? I mean, we're good people. We're good people! We're never gonna get those years back. - We've still got time. - [Julie sniffs] [Alan] We don't have to die as these people. We don't have to be victims. [Alan] It's all right now. It's all right. It's all right. - [knock at door] - Yeah? [Karl] Ally, do you have any raisins? I'm sorry. I said, do you have any raisins? [sighs] OK, well how about a date? I'm busy, Karl. See, are you Jamaican? [Caribbean accent] Cause you're Ja-maican me crazy. Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. Let me take you out. I don't think so. You... me... Think about it. We could have a great time. Sleep on it. And for the meantime... here is a sneak... preview. Get out. [Ally laughs] Ally? Look, we've got to go see Jakob Marosi. Marosi, why? [sighs] The timeline's off, OK? He couldn't have done it. He's lying. Well, did you check the case files? What is it? I'm gonna tell you something but this stays between us, OK? Yeah, of course. They're missing. What do you mean, they're missing? I don't know. I don't know, they're just missing. But what I do know is that Marosi's confession is bullshit. Pretty girl. [Danny] We'd like to ask you some questions about the disappearance of Jesse Wells in 1995. He was good, one of my favourites. Oh, you can skip the performance. [Danny] There's a book about you, you've been immortalised. We don't need the whole child-killer routine. Charmer. Is he like this with you? [clears throat] So, erm... you confessed to murdering him. That's because I did it. Yeah, you know, new evidence suggests that's highly unlikely. - New evidence? - [Danny] Yeah. [Marosi laughs] OK, then, I didn't. Oh, I'm convinced you didn't. So that being the case, why did you lie about killing him? Are you saying your fellow policemen got it all wrong? They were happy enough to believe it at the time. Happy enough to let the press splash it across their front pages. Oh, I know. The officer in charge of that case was my father. - What is your name again? - DS Daniel Kenwood. Ray's boy? Yeah. Oh, no. I should have known. Interview's terminated. - I'm sorry... - Interview over. I have nothing more to say to you. Son of Ray Kenwood! Black man doing a white man's job. Trying to prove he was up to the cut. Willing to do whatever it takes to get result. Interview over. I have nothing more to say to the son of Ray Kenwood. [electricity crackles and fizzes] Hi. I was wondering if you could help me. That's what I'm here for, sir, and my sign is the confirmation. So, we do rooms by the hour, rooms by the day, rooms by the week. The week? Yes, it's what people want. Mine is not to reason why, mine is to take their money. I can arrange for female company, I can arrange male company, I can arrange anything you like. No kink too strange. So, my good friend, how can I help you? I want to see the Envy Room. Ah, the Envy man. A man with a penchant for fruitless yearning, are we? I just want to see it. I'm afraid it's occupied at the moment. Somebody took it for a month. A month? I thought you said the longest was a week? Yes, well, they took it for a week, then at the end of that week, they took it for another. And then at the end of that week, they took it for another week. I get the picture. I guess you're not prepared to tell me who took it? Correct. Confidentiality is my middle name. Well, actually, it's Leonard. That's because my parents were Reggie Perrin fans. Is the occupant in right now? I wouldn't know. He doesn't even let us in to clean. Right. Well, how about we take a walk down there, see if he's in? If he's not in, I can have a little peep inside. - A peep? - Thirty seconds. Breach of guest's privacy. I'm sorry, sir. There are no possible circumstances in which that scenario could happen. - Fifty quid. - Done. [knocks at door] [receptionist] Hello? In and out quick as you can. That's our motto. [receptionist] Jesus Christ. Get out. Did you know about this? - No. - Why did you want to see the room? Who are you? What's happening? - I don't know. - Where are you going? Come back here! I'm calling the... police. [exhales heavily] Slade, it's Mark. I hope you're OK, mate. Look, just um... Give us a call, yeah? Because... we're all really worried about you. You know, I know that you can look after yourself, right? But... You loved her. I'm just trying to say... just come back soon. I need you, mate. [text alert] - Show me your phone! - No. I know it's from him. Show me your phone. - You are being... - Show me the goddamn phone! You want to see it? There's the phone! From Mark. Surprise, surprise. "I need to speak to you. Call me. Kiss" Well, here you go, Pru. You'd better give him a call. Kiss. I don't need this. Oh, beautiful, storming out! How convenient! Storm out, blame me, go to him. - I'm not going to him. - Where are you going? - I'm getting away from you! - From me? What about your daughter? You've got a daughter. Will you be back or shall I prepare your excuses? Stuart, please, just let me have some time on my own. - I'll know if you've been with him. - I can't be around you now. Just leave me alone! [music blares] Hi, can I get a gin and tonic, please? A double. [sniffs] Rough day? Sometimes, Karl, I wish I had a job that didn't constantly remind me what a disturbing place the world can be. Well, you know what they say. Alcohol is the anaesthetic by which we endure the operation of life. That's almost profound. It was on a beer mat. - Just get me drunk. - I think I can manage that.

Looking for Kenton, helping Simon. He really appreciates it too. It's OK, he's a good kid. I also wanted to say... the months we spent together, they really meant a lot to me. They were really special, Mark. [sighs] To be honest, I'd never felt like that before. You know, it scared me. I felt out of control. You know, when you're running down a hill and you can't stop? I don't know why I'm saying any of this, or how I expect you to react, I just... [sniffs] I wasn't there for you. Hardest time in your life with Jesse and... you needed me. - It's OK. - No. No, it's not. [sniffs] I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Mark.
