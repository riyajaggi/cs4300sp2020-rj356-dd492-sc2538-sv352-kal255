 I'm a solicitor. When you get to the police station, call me. You knew where he was all along. You knew about the whole thing. You were so destructive, smashing things with that bat. Where'd you go after you'd run out? They've found Jesse's DNA at Newman's crime scene. - Maybe Jesse killed Newman. - That's impossible, because I killed Newman. - Alan. - Mm-hm? - There's someone in the house. - No, there isn't. Shut up. No, no, no, no. Hello? Hey!

 Shit! Alan? Oh, jeez! Ow! You bastard! What have you done? They went into Jesse's room too. It was him, wasn't it? Jesse? Oh, it's glass. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. Open. Open wide. Don't bite. How could he bite through the glass? Al? Are you OK? I'll get you some tissue. Did you set out to kill this Newman guy? Slade, come on! You can't just tell me you killed two people and leave it at that. This... This first guy, this Dempsey guy, I understand. It's him or Kenton. I can understand that but, with Newman... This Newman destroyed girls' lives. One of those girls was Britnay. - OK... - No, no, no, just, please, shut up. OK, you asked. Now you listen. - Sorry, I can't... - Brit! Just let me die! Stop it! No! Come on. Eat your breakfast. Eat! Stop it! What are you doing here? But it was self-defence, right? What does that mean? So you would've killed him anyway? If he'd lived, he would've implicated Britnay. I had two choices. Kill that monster or let him destroy her all over again. It was an easy choice. Help. Please. I'm at 3 Manville Avenue. Help. This Newman, he could've told us about Jesse. I didn't know that, did I, Mark? At the time, I didn't know... Maybe you shouldn't go around killing people, then. - I was protecting Britnay. - Yeah, well, it didn't work. Did it, Slade? Mum? Danny's here. - Mum. Mum, Mum, Mum. - Oh, Mark. This is a personal thing. I'm asking for a favour. - Hi, Slade. - Are you all right, Dad? - Yeah. Cut my foot. It's all right. - So... is it definite? Was it him? Well, your dad saw him. I only heard him. Excuse me. No, I saw someone running into the park. I couldn't see his face. He was in a hoodie. He was in Jesse's room, looking through family photos. - We think. We're not sure. - Some of the photos are missing. You said he had a backpack he could've put them in. Thank you. Look, CSI can't be here till the morning. Erm... Julie can stay with you and your dad till then? - Yeah, of course. - Listen, I've got to go. - You'll call me? - Yeah. Thanks, Danny. - Thanks, Danny. - Night, mate. Danny, what do you reckon? Jesse or not Jesse? Your guess. OK. See you. - Hey. Oh, yes! Yes! - Keep your voice down. Shut the door. I don't wanna wake the kids up. - Where have you been? - Oh, yeah, Julie called. - They had a break-in. - And who is looking after our kids? No, no, look, I left some notes. I left them loads of notes saying I'd be back. One each. And then you just left them... with Ray? That's super-safe, isn't it? They're asleep. What if something happened? Look, I'm... I'm sorry. It was a one-off, OK. Um... It was wrong. Course it's wrong. OK. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Let's go upstairs and wake the kids up. They're gonna be so happy you're back. I'm only here to take them to school. You and me, we're in big trouble, Danny. Look, I hate being away. I hate it, but... - Jen, I know something's gotta give. - Good. Yeah. So I've been thinking: let's just get someone in. Let's pay for them to come in, two or three times a week to help out. I am further down the road than you. I came here to tell you that Ray has to go. I'm not putting my dad in a home. OK? That is not gonna happen. You just have to take him to your sister's. That's the ultimatum. Ray goes to stay with Sarah. He is her father too. - That is never gonna happen. - Oh, she has done nothing so far. Make it happen. And stop smoking. It was any old burglar going through any old house. And my very expensive iPad isn't good enough for him? It was on the side. You can't miss it. - Maybe he's got an iPad. - It was Jesse. And he was in his old room looking for photos. I know it was... - I felt something. I still do. - No, you just want it to be him. You don't understand. Or maybe I do. It was him. Where were you, Danny? But what if she's right? Shouldn't you be at work? No, there's nothing there that can't wait. Do you think that's blood or ketchup there? Look. It's ketchup, Dad. It's all ketchup. Look, why don't you just sit down? You can take your pinny off. - No. - We can just talk about this. - No, I've gotta start prepping. - So you open a little late today. You're becoming obsessed, like your mother. - Fat lot of good it's done her. - But he came to our house. It was just a kid breaking in. And if he's alive, why doesn't he call us? Hmm? We're his family. Why doesn't he come and find us? Explain that. Huh? I still believe that he's gone, Mark. But, whatever happened... it wasn't our fault. We have to let it go. Dad. Dad, what are you doing? I need a new place to hide your baseball bat. Dad. Come here. Come here. Come here. Come here. Look at me. Listen, I had nothing to do with Jesse's disappearance. I was visiting Hannah's and Jodie's graves - Frank's kids killed in that car crash. I went there whenever I was unhappy. I was at the cemetery, Dad. I thought you'd killed him! So every time you looked at me, you thought... you were looking at a murderer? Are you smoking again? - Can I have one? - No, Dad. You gave up years ago. Listen to me, this is important. I love you. OK? I love you. It's easy to say. Give me a cigarette. And I know that you were trying to protect me all those years and I love you for that. I love you. Just one. Hello? Can I help you with something? - Bye, Mum. - Bye, baby. There you go, sweetie. Pru! Pru! - So, my mom's coming over. - Oh, nice. Why don't we ask her to look after Nico? You know, that way you and me can shoot off on our own for a bit. You know, somewhere quiet, somewhere where it's just the two of us. Cause us fighting all the time, I can see what it's doing to Nico. What do you think? Good idea, huh? Great idea. Be just like the good old days. - Are you ready for Mr Payne? - Yeah, let's do it. Ah, I trust you haven't, er, forgotten about our glam rock charity gig? It's today. - You did sign up. - Yeah, it's all I can think about. Love you, too! Can I have a word with you outside? Listen, you can't represent this man. I ran a check on his plates. This is the guy that beat you up. Both misunderstandings. Both cleared up. OK, cool. Well, try misunderstanding this. He beats up a lot of people. In fact, his record covers the whole range of violence. He makes his living off of prostitution. He calls me up, he says he wants to confess to two murders. So here I am, Danny. This is what I do. This is what you do. So do me a favour and let me help you out for once. Porter had a girl killed who used to work for me. Who was that? Selena Callaway. Selena Callaway was killed by Porter? Well, he farmed it out. He didn't do it personally. But, if he's targeting my girls, he's gonna target me. So I made a pre-emptive strike. - Then you went to his house... - To kill him. OK. The other guy, Matt Lohan, he just got in the way. Tried to defend Porter. Porter shot me and then he shot Lohan. Porter started it. I finished it. So who did kill Selena Callaway? Harry Dempsey. Works for Porter. Well, worked. So where's this Harry Dempsey now? Laying low, I'd imagine. Is that him? It's an age-progression image. Well, they never really look like anyone, do they? I mean, it's possible but, on the whole, no. Well... maybe. I don't know. Is Harry Dempsey local? Where's he from? What's his accent? - I don't have a clue. - Describe him. Shaved head. Kind of wiry. A bit shorter than me. Look, I really don't know. He's unremarkable. Two eyes, two ears, a nose, yeah? I'm trying to help you. Yeah, well, try a little bit harder. OK? Thanks. I don't know. OK. Well, let's keep it simple. Where did you last see Harry Dempsey? We were running a scam out of the Old Town. It's a hotel. You killed someone. They had a shooting here. Bloodstains were found two days ago in the Envy Room, whatever that is. Oh, old blood, a week old. Scatter patterns typical of gunshots. There was a lot of blood, but no body was found. Hey. ♪ Good morning, good morning Sunbeams will soon shine through ♪ ♪ Good morning, good morning to you and you and you and you ♪ Morning. This man ran a string of girls out of your hotel. You recognise him, right? String of what? I'm so bad with faces... - His name's Payne. - And names. How about this one: Harry Dempsey? He likes attacking people. He'll be the wiry guy with the shaved head that you decided not to backchat on a number of occasions. Does that ring any bells, or are you deaf as well? Oh, sorry, did you say something? Sorry. Says you're a defrocked lawyer. And a nightmare in the witness box. Somehow, I never say what you want me to. Shall we take a look at the room where the shooting took place? The Envy Room. Yes. Yes, you must. Yes. Perfect. Brilliant. Because if I say to you "Envy", what springs to mind? - What? - I'm talking colour schemes. You see, they've gone for caramel and beige. Carpets, walls, ceiling. The whole lot. The room where the shooting took place has been redecorated? Yes, well, there was blood all up the walls. What did you want them to do, make a feature of it? Harry Dempsey might come looking for you if we don't find him first. Ooh, I don't think he'll be back here, do you? Oh. OK. I'll meet you in the car, after you've finished killing yourself. Danny! Dempsey or Jesse? It's Dempsey's car. - Yeah? - Danny, I need you to come in. They've found something else in Newman's garden. Why? What is it? The book Jesse Wells had when he disappeared. It was buried two feet down, so under the top soil and laid flat. So, what? Jesse was held by Newman? He escaped? Went back? It makes sense. His DNA was found there. All right, run all the checks on this and let's crack on. OK? And I feel so bad... Cause he was being kind. He just wants things to be nice between us. And, Mark, I treat him appallingly. I mean, I really do. But he'll just come back with some new suggestion. Like what? Like let's just go away, just him and me. - You don't wanna do that? - No, I don't. No. Oh, I dunno. I mean, no. No, I don't. How could I? How could I? He touched my arm and it made my skin crawl. But then he brings Nico up. When you bring children into the equation, it changes everything. I really need to talk to you... I'm so sorry, I'm on call. That's OK. It's not OK, cause it means I have to go. It's fine. I have to do something this afternoon. - OK. - Erm, what time do you finish? I'll... I'll come and meet you. Seven. Great. - Oh, my God. Sorry. I'm... - It's OK. Don't worry. - OK. Bye. - To be continued. Yeah. Hi. Yeah, I'm coming. Erm, one final reminder. Full attendance is required for the glam rock gig this evening. By order of the DI. Thank you very much. Thank you. All right. Come on. Let's go to work. - Mickey? Taser time. - Oh, no, that's not funny. - You shouldn't be handling that. - It's been decommissioned. Oh, shit. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Ally, can you cover for me this afternoon? - Yeah, sure. - Thanks. Hey, Jen, it's me. Er... I'm gonna do it. OK? I'm gonna do it now. Can you just...? Can you just come with me, so I don't back out? - Hey, sis. - Hi. Dad needs a change of scene. Does he? Well, I guess this is what it feels like to dump your old dad. - Go home, shall we? - Are you finished for the day? Er, yeah. Well, I'm... The whole station's supposed to go to this, erm, charity gig, but I could skip that. No. No, no, we should go. We should do this. This is what I'm talking about. I wanna meet the people you work with. Put faces to names, you know, join the two worlds. What about the kids? Oh, I'll make a phone call. You and me at a gig. Hello! He was wearing exactly the same clothes as the guy that broke into my mum's house. He was wearing this hoodie and this backpack. - You mean...? - I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I'm not saying that it's Jesse, right? So this afternoon I went back to the woods, to have a look where this guy had been watching me from. Right? And there was this patch of ground that had been raked over and it was warm to the touch. - There's been a fire there. So... - Hang on, wait. What? But if it is Jesse, why would he be going back to where he disappeared, lighting fires and then covering them up? I dunno. I dunno. That's why I'm going back there tonight. - What, on your own? - Yeah. No. Not a good idea. He could be a psychopath. Oh, come on. I have to go. I have to find out. I have to. I can't just leave it. - OK, I'm coming with you. - OK, that is really not a good idea. You think I'm a pussy? I can fight, remember. Oh, I think you might be forgetting this. - Ow! - See? I'm coming. Listen, I'm thinking that maybe we should, erm... We should get ourselves a cab home. - Oh, what, have a drink or two? - Mmm-hmm. Or three or four. - Three or four? - Mmm-hmm. Danny! Are you out of your mind? You were in the clear. - Ally covered for you. - Hey, he's here because he's a lover of music and he's a true fan. Don't touch the suit. ♪ That's right Really love your tiger light ♪ ♪ That's neat, that's neat, that's neat, that's neat ♪ ♪ I really love your tiger feet ♪ ♪ I really love your tiger feet ♪ All right, hey, can I get, er, two rum and cokes and two beers? What, what have you got? Is it draft or bottled? - Erm, it's no alcohol, I'm afraid. - Come again? Well, it's a charity gig for PADD, for Police Against Drink Driving. It's soft drinks and fruit punch only. Great. That's great. 'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, 'ello! What a turnout, uh? We are Firefly and we're gonna start with this. Did you leave any umbrellas for yourself? ♪ Bow-um-bow ♪ ♪ Make me a deal and make it straight ♪ ♪ All signed and sealed, I'll take it ♪ ♪ To Robert E Lee, I'll show it ♪ ♪ I hope and pray he doesn't blow it cause we've been around ♪ I'm saving the second, third, fourth, fifth and the sixth dance for you. And if you fancy this one, too... Tough one, mate. Don't tell me this was his idea of a fun night? No. No, no, I warned her. I warned you, right? No, this is fine. This is fine. It's... It's fun. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. This is fun. - Come on, let's have a dance. - Nah, I'm all right. - Go on. - Nah, it's OK. Hold my bag. You stay here with your drink. Great. I'm just gonna get my jacket. Actually, why am I doing this? Why aren't you doing this with Slade? I dunno. ♪ I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation ♪ ♪ You're living in the past of the new generation ♪ ♪ And a guy can do what he wants to do ♪ ♪ And that's what I'm gonna do ♪ ♪ Cause I don't give a damn 'bout my bad reputation ♪ ♪ Oh, no, not me ♪ Do we even know where we're going?

Is it scratched, or have you got something in it? Erm, I dunno. Maybe both. You're the one looking at it. Mark! Oh... I'll wait in the car, then. Great. - I need to get in there. - You're not coming in here. - I need to get in! - No, no, no, no. Hey! - Out you go. Go on. - How many exits are there? - What's going on? - How many exits are there - in this building? - Just one. I'm calling the police. I'm calling them too. - Yeah? - Danny! Danny! Danny, I've got him. - What? Who? - Jesse. I've got him trapped in the building. Sorry to disturb the party. I need as many officers as possible. We have a possible sighting of a murder suspect. As many people as I can right now. Thank you. Thank you very much. Sorry, babe. Babe, I'm so sorry. I've gotta go. I love you. Take the car. Mark? Are you OK? What happened? I'm good. I'm good. Where are you? How are you? I'm fine. I'm... I'm by the car. You just took off. Well, didn't you see him? I-I think it was Jesse. I've got him holed up in this building. Pru, Danny's here. I can't really talk right now. You get yourself home. I'll call you tomorrow. - Talk to me. - He's in this building here. OK, listen up. I want two groups. Ally, you play points. Spread out. I want every inch covered. Go! Go! Go! Thank you. - How many exits are there? - Just the one. OK, good. - Danny, can I go in there? - No, no, no. Let them do their job. OK, we're in. All right, guys, spread out and keep in contact. Yeah. All right. Copy that. Just send everyone down. There's no-one up there. What? No. No, no, no. That's not possible. I saw him run in there. I chased him. I saw him run up those stairs. Danny, he's in there. - There's no-one up there now. - Then check again, then! - We've been up to the roof and back. - OK. Is there any way that he could have got to another building from up there? Not unless he's Spider-Man. OK, er... sorry, everyone. False alarm. Thanks for coming down. - Your mate's loopy. You know that? - Yeah. Coming up with crap like this, it's crazy. All right. Thank you. OK, thank you very much. Danny... Danny, I saw him. He's in there. - He's in there. - Yeah. Well, he's not in there now. And there's nowhere to hide. All right? We scoured the place. Come on. It's been a long night. I'll take you home. Hello? Hi, Mum. Oh, hello, stranger. Sorry, I've... How are you? How's things? Well, your father's been drinking all day. Alan, no! I want you out. Back to Mark's. Come on! Just a sex object, aren't I? Once you've had your way with me, that's it, I can go. Well, at least your long-term memory's holding up. Mum, do you need me to come and pick him up? No, you're all right. - Maybe come in the morning, yeah? - Yeah, OK. Bye. Oh, dear. Where have you been? What do you care, Mark? Just asking. Look, Slade, this morning, you know I... - Look, I just wanna say... - Look, I messed up with Newman. Yeah. But I'd do it again, Mark. Is that directed at me or yourself? Oh, no, mate. Mainly me, me, me. But, you know, you shouldn't really feel left out of it. I chase people who aren't there and you kill people. We're mad. Louder. Say it louder. You know what's really scary, though? That person I chased... he was as real as you are there. - Right there. - I'm not here, I'm in bed. I'm trying to be serious here. What I'm saying is I know what madness is. Madness is when you know you're right and the rest of the world thinks you're wrong. Well, sanity's consensus, isn't it? Not what's true. You're right. But consensus can change. Therefore, maybe there was someone there. Or, rather, maybe there is someone there. They vanished into somewhere that they can't vanish. No-one saw them, apart from me. Danny goes in and searches the whole building and there's no-one, absolutely no-one. You know, I'm just chasing someone that I wanna chase. You know, some sprinter that I'm never gonna be able to catch. It's the burglar that my dad described exactly, right down to the backpack he was wearing with that smiley face on it. You know what's really scary? I thought we'd had the scary stuff. I still think I saw him. You explain this. OK? What? The Gulliver's Travel picture book that we found in Newman's garden yesterday, it's not an original. - What do you mean? - It's a reprint from 2005. It's a second edition. It's a reprint made ten years after Jesse disappeared. But it's exactly like the one that Jesse had that day. - Right. - And found at Newman's. OK. No, no. OK. No, it makes no sense. This is just... Do you think someone's screwing with us? - What do you mean? - I mean... All right. Jesse's DNA is found at two different murder scenes. Someone is stealing photos from Julie's house. Mark thinks someone is following him. And now this... The same picture book Jesse had. But not the same. And found at Newman's house, where a body was found also. Right. Someone is setting us up deliberately. Just came in. What is it? It's from Jakob Marosi. He wants to see me. He says he wants to tell us about Jesse. What? Who else is lying about that day?
