 He moves to a remote house and tries to make himself invisible. I love you. Is Jesse's DNA from that plaster? What about blood donation? Do you happen to know the names of the people that owned this place? You have to see this. - Mark! - Frank! Hello, Mark. I suppose you being here means you want answers. ♪ Beans, beans Good for your heart ♪ ♪ The more you eat The more you fart ♪ ♪ The more you fart The better you feel ♪ - Girls, that's enough. - It's not swearing. Yes, it is. And even if it isn't, it's still very irritating. ♪ Beans, beans Are good for your heart ♪

 - His name's Robert. - His name's Karl! - It's mine! - It's mine! Girls! I'm so sorry. I tried calling, but you must have left. It's Mark. He's been up all night. Temperature and vomiting. - I'm going to keep him home today. - Oh boy, I'm sorry. I can still pick up your girls after school. Alan should be home by then. - Are you sure that's OK? - Yes, of course. Thanks, Julie. Hope Mark's feeling better. - Have a good day, Frank. - You too. Girls! Pack it in! Will you stop... Hannah, will you stop irritating your sister? In a split second, everything changed. My wife and I were never the same again. She blamed me for what happened. Your mother was kind. She was there for me. Our lives were destroyed in that one moment. One decision... taken... In the blink of an eye... The consequences last forever. I don't need hope. I need reality. That's what I deal in now. Simple, basic reality. Oh, Frank! Frank! I think she did it out of pity. But afterwards, she regretted it. She loved your father. - Doesn't make sense. - Frank, you're married. I'm married. She's left me. You're a beautiful man, but this was never supposed to get serious. Jesse. I asked her once if he was mine. She said, "No. I'm certain." ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ As Jesse got older, I'd look at him. I could see it. I knew he was mine. Then that day in the park happened. Just go! - Jesse! - Slade! What are we gonna do? - Suppose Jesse tells? - He won't. I'll make sure of it. And neither will we. We tell no one. OK? Daniel! Come back here! Daniel! Daniel! Get back here now! Get in! Jesse? - Hi, there. - Hi. You haven't seen a Golden Labrador around here, have you? His name's Blackie. Damn! I let him off his lead and now I can't find him anywhere. Shall I tell you why I call him Blackie? He was from a litter of pups. And that means... babies that mummy dog has. And they were all black. Except Blackie. He was golden. So when I took him home, I thought it would be nice to pretend he was like his brothers and sisters. Huh? I have a picture if you'd like to see it. Uh? - Where are you going? - I have to go home. - No, no. You wait. - I can't! Don't they teach manners at school? Huh? Don't they teach you to respect your elders? Leave him alone. You. Get your hands off him. I know him. Who the hell are you? His father. You want to bring him up properly. He's got foul mouth! Come on, Jesse. Let's go. That man lost his black dog. - Had he? - That's what he said. Will you take me home after? Your mum phoned and said it would be OK if you stayed the night. Thought it might be fun if you spent some time with me. Boys together. And wait for me. Good boy. Uh-uh. Wait a minute. - This way. - Where are we going? To the seaside. Donkey rides and ice cream. I want my mummy! There are some things I need to tell you, Jesse. Big things. About who you are and who I am. Are you a big enough boy to listen carefully? Are you sure? I'd been left a house in the country. I moved Jesse there... where no one knew us. This used to be my mother's house, your grandma. - When did she die? - A long time ago. Before you were born. She was a lovely woman. She'd have loved you. Jesse, when you move to a new place, you get the chance to start everything all over again. I've been thinking, I don't want to be Frank any more. I want to be Ronald. Who do you want to be? If you weren't Jesse, if you had the choice of any name in the whole wide world? I'd come back to Westbridge now and again. Show my face. Mow the lawn. After a couple of years, I sold it, left the area for good. Karl? - Good luck today. - It's all in here. What can they ask me about chemistry that I can't answer? Call me afterwards. Love you. Everything was fine for years, until one night... - What do you do? - Police forensics. Analyst. It's really cool. It's like what you see on TV. - Same again? - Yeah. And shots. Black Sambucas? I'm on call! - So have you ever seen a dead body? - Oh, hundreds. Where the fuck is this murder, anyway? Violet Hotel. I should've wrote it down. - Give me a suit. - No way, man. Come on, let me see the scene. Splatter zone. It's like a Jackson Pollock in here! Forensics report, from Ken. With the DNA results from the plaster found at the scene. Double-check these forensic results. Why, what's the problem? We've had a DNA hit from the MisPer database, from a kid that went missing in 1995. So stop impressing your boyfriend and check them again. Thanks. Go! His father. Thanks, nurse. That's great. - Son! - Dad. Dad... I've got something I need to ask you. Who the hell am I? It's Karl. My boy. I'm dying, Mark. Look at me. All these tubes. If you want me to pay for it, if you want me to suffer... The pain that you've caused... You ruined their lives! You lost your daughters. You know how it feels to have something snatched away. That made it easier. Life had shat all over me. I had nothing to lose. Alan and Julie still had their child. Their real child. You. But Karl, or Jesse, he was as much mine as theirs. And look how they neglected him, letting him nearly get killed by that man. He saved my life. That boy saved my life. Through to Karl. Depending on how fit you are, leave a message. Hi, Karl, it's Ally. Listen, can you just give me a call as soon as you get this? Mark... It's voicemail. Why is no one answering? Hi, Mark, it's Pru. Call me when you get this. It's urgent. - This is crazy. Karl? - Jesse. Does he remember anything from his past? - Frank. - Sometimes he'd cry out in his sleep. "Mum." "Mark." I tried to remove all that. Er, and I was clever. I knew just how to play it. Your mother would come round the house, I'd let her in. We'd have tea. I'd help out with the search party. How could you? Hate me if you want to. I deserve that. But when I saw Jesse in the park that day, maybe I was blinded by my own grief, I felt like his father. I felt fiercely protective. It was like some higher power had put me there that moment to protect my son. And now... I'm not asking for forgiveness. But I'll be gone soon. Karl hasn't come today. He always comes. Wait with me. We can see him together. We'll get him looked after, someone that specialises in Alzheimer's... knows how to look after him properly. And then we'll go on holiday. Like a proper length of time, you, me and the kids. Take a month off of work. Throw my phone in the river. I'm sorry. Let's never forget this moment. Life will get busy again. Normality will kick in. Let's never forget how this feels. What are you doing? - Danny? - It's a Nigerian symbol. It means "Learn from your mistakes". No, he's not answering. We need him here. It's not like Danny to not answer. The fire must have been really bad. I'm gonna go and see if he's OK. You stay here. Wait for Karl. Look, Mark, I'm... I'm not a big believer in fate or destiny or any of that bullshit, but... But what? But, like it or not, Frank saved Jesse's life that day. Jesse's alive because of Frank. Cause we let him go that day and, if it wasn't for Frank, then who knows? You know what I mean? - He should have brought him home. - I know. Of course. Of course. But just... I'll be back. - Ken, where's Karl? - No idea. Why? - I need to speak to him. - Concerning...? It's private. Where is he? You two are like twins. - Did he leave the office? - I really don't know. Well, if he comes back, tell him I'm looking for him. Hey, um, I think Ally might be onto something. Ally, you don't... Tell me the truth or I will squeeze these so hard that you'll need surgery to separate them. Leave! - What do you know? - Nothing. What... do you know? He's not dangerous. He's just... He's just confused. - Keep talking. - Get off. Keep talking! He found something out about who he really was. It sent him spinning. Look, I only helped him because he's my friend. And because I screwed up. What did you do? It was me who brought him to the murder scene. I was drunk. He drove me. If that came out, that's me done. It was my fault, Ally. All this shit was my fault. DNA came back. Blood on a plaster. Karl realised it was his. He's only an analyst, so his DNA wasn't in the system. The system said it belonged to a missing kid called Jesse Wells. He realised there was only one explanation. He was Jesse Wells. His dad admitted it. He was angry. His whole life was unravelling. He was scared. He was punching walls, and screaming. That's how I found him, in bits. That's why I agreed to help him. - How? - He wanted to hide his identity, to protect his real father so he didn't die in a prison cell. Say what you want about what the guy did, Karl loved him. - He was his dad. - What did you do? I screwed with the murder scene. At the Newman house. Planted more of his blood to... to throw people off. - Jesus Christ, you idiot. - I didn't want to! I told him, but if I came forward, said what was going on... Ally, I would have lost everything. Ally, please, I am begging you, please do not let this come out. It has to, Ken. Planting evidence? Jesus! - I cannot lose my job! - Is he still angry? - I don't know. - And what's his state of mind? He buried it down, pretended it wasn't happening. He was pretty torn up. Look, Ally, Ally, he really likes you. - Maybe you can talk to him. - Where is he? I don't know. Hey, Pru, what's up? Slade, thank God. Where's Mark? It's a long answer right now. I need to see him. - If this is about you and him... - It's not that. It's about Jesse. - What about him? - He's here. I think he's here. - Where are you? - At the police station. Hey, Karl! Hey, gorgeous! You out all alone? It's cold out here. Er... Have you got time for a drink? - We could get a coffee or something. - I've already got one. Or a proper drink, just... just have a chat? Is everything OK? - Yeah, everything's fine. - It's just, you seem a bit... No, I'm fine. Shall we get that drink? Just go! Another time. Karl? Karl, wait. Jesse! Please, wait! Jesse! Slade, it's Jesse! He's in the one-way system. - Pru, where are you? - Colbon Street. OK, I'm on my way! Come on, come on! Come on! - Where is he? - There! In the silver car! Oh, shit! Jesse? Jesse? Oi! Hey, I got your message. He took him. He knew he was his and he took him. And Mum never knew anything, did she? She never suspected anything. And he was alive the whole time, 50 fucking miles away. 50 fucking miles away, Danny, and he's been alive the whole fucking time! He's been alive the whole fucking time! He always comes, every day. I'm worried for him. Little Danny. Police officer now. - Frank... - I know what I did was wrong and I'm ready to take the consequences, such as they are. But I want you to know this... He didn't suffer. No. There was some confusion at the start, some sadness. He missed his family, of course he did. But after a while... things changed. He accepted me as his father. And... He was happy, Mark. He wasn't mistreated. He... He was happy. He had a good life. It's a shame the rest of us didn't. So what are you gonna do? How long have they given you? Weeks. - Hey, Slade. - I lost him, Danny. But I'm at his car, so I'll call you back. I told you to smash the window! Yeah, Slade, I don't really feel comfortable smashing a car window with a brick in the middle of the street. But obviously you do. - It's Slade. Yeah? - Bit of a weird one. We, um, trawled Karl's car, and we found something in the glove box. - What is it? - It's a library card. Library card? It's the library where Mark's mum works. OK. We also found something else. Something else like what? Bullets. Lots of them. - I don't understand. - We need more information. The person we've identified is almost certainly the person whose DNA we found at the crime scenes. - Jesse? - Mum... He's got a different name now, but there's a strong chance it's him. - Where is he? - We're trying to find out. - He ran away. - Oh, you've lost him? We're scared that, um, he might do something stupid to himself or to somebody else. He's angry. Is that... He wouldn't hurt me. He wouldn't. We think he might have been here at the library whilst you were here. We found this in his car. I'd know him. If I'd seen him, if he'd been here, if my child was here, I'd know him. OK, er, look, um, can you have a look and see what he might have taken out, what dates he may have been here? Mm... He was here yesterday. Borrowed one book. Gulliver's Travels. It's Jesse! I think I know where he might be. Hello? Hello? Could you run those through when you've a chance? Tough one, mate. Mark! There's only one exit here. All right, guys, spread out. Keep in contact. Hi, I'm Pru. A friend of Danny's. - An admirer? - It's just Karl. Jesse! Jesse! If we see him, be careful. OK? He's my brother, Slade. Jesse. I could never tie my shoelaces. You'd help me. You'd tie them for me. I remember that. You used to get on my nerves with songs. Always singing. "The Grand Old Duke Of York". "Miss Molly Had A Dolly". You used to come into my bed every morning. It didn't matter if it was a weekday or weekend, you used to climb into my bed, and, um, the first thing that you'd do is, you'd ask a question. "Why do elephants have big ears?" "Why do volcanoes have lava?" They're good questions. You had an inquisitive mind. This is where we used to play. Yeah. Yeah, this was our spot. Ours. Except... we didn't know about the lies we'd been told. Didn't know the truth, did we? No. - She lied to us. - Mum made a mistake, Karl. And she... tried her best to make it good again. Mum loved you. - It's blown my world apart. - I know. Nothing's what I thought it was. Jess... Karl. Let's deal with it. Yeah? Let's deal with it and let's make it right again. Can we? You're my brother. And Mum is still your mum. And Dad... You've got no idea how much he loves you. His or not... - We just want you home. - You know? And all of us that were there that day: Danny, Pru, Slade... our lives, they changed, you know, and we weren't the same people. But finding you... knowing you're still alive... I remember at school... I used to tell people I had a big brother. And they'd say, "No, you haven't." And I'd say, "I have." "He's tough, he's big, and if you don't watch out, he'll come and get you." We just want you back. I've been waiting to take my brother home for 20 years. It's time to go home. Mum. Mum. Hello, son. - I'm sorry. - It's OK. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I love you too. - It's a mess, though, isn't it? - Yeah. We'll find a way. We'll find a way. Doesn't matter. Subtitles by explosiveskull
