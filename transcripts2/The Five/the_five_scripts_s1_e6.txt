 Have you checked his old case files? Where are the files? - Rough day? - Just get me drunk. I hope we're watching this together, and laughing... somewhere sunny... Australia, maybe. Or Florida. You always wanted to go to Disneyland as a kid. But if we're not together, then something's probably happened to me. The information on this memory stick is what got me killed. But it's gonna keep you alive. This is what I want you to do. Morning, tiger. I've got a lot of work on. It's my mum's 60th. I don't see her every day. Lorraine. It's Jennifer. Who's gonna look after the kids? Megan can look after herself. - So can I! - The boys can do after-school club. Who's gonna look after Dad? I can't baby-sit. I've got work. That's for you to sort out. OK. OK, when are you back? I don't know, Danny. When you've sorted it. Jennifer, I... Jennifer? Jennifer! Hey, it's Ally. I'm probably on a call because I'm so popular. Yeah, it's me. Head to the park. I want to check out a new route Jesse may have taken. Um... Call me straight back. Do you want to get a breakfast smoothie or something? - Gotta replace those fluids. - I just want to get to work. We hooked up. It's not like we have to get married. How about we never talk about it again? Speechless, eh? Do you mind if we stop for a sec? I've just got to drop something off for my dad. Don't be too long, yeah? Aw... can't bear to be without me, eh? - Hey, guys. - Hi. Hello. I wanted to call but I know that... Stuart checks your phone. - Yeah, but not in a psycho way. - Right. Right. Right. So that's why he tracked you to my flat last night. That was my fault. I was pissed. And he was just worried. I thought it would be funny to give you a shock through your window. - Certainly did that. - I'm really sorry. I'm such a dick. Can I just take you out for breakfast to make up for it? I can't today. I've got to try and find that Alexa. - Coming in? - Yeah. - Hey, Mercy. - Hiya. - Any sign of Slade? - Oh, nothing. Sorry. And we can really use him back. Well, I mean, I'm around. What's up? Rashan's been giving free prison tats in memory of Britnay. Proper biro and syringe job. Now half the kids are feeling rough. Yeah, that's infected. - Shouldn't that be an "E"? - No, it's an "A", for "Britnay". Oh. Sorry. - Here. Let me have a look at that. - Yeah? - Mercy. - Yeah? Do you know a girl called Alexa? Been here a couple of days. - She's got a cast on her arm. - Oh, I think so. She's definitely not a regular but I think I've seen her talking to... to Lorna. Over there. OK. I don't know what to say, Dad. I mean, she's funny. She's hardy, but she's funny. And she's pretty. Oh, God, she's pretty, Dad. Here we go. I mean, she could probably do with working on her cardio a bit but... - Is she blonde? - Yeah. Why? Sorry. I was just looking for a glass of water. - I um... - Oh. Right. Well, Ally... this is my dad, Ron. Dad, this is my workmate, Ally. Hi. She's gorgeous. God, I don't even know my dad's name. My mum wanted a baby but she couldn't be bothered with a man. Clock was ticking so she had IVF and brought me up on her own. - Explains a lot. - Such as? Well, you're independent, career-minded... looking for a strong man to call Daddy. That's why you're not in profiling. Hey, do you um... want me to drop you off round the corner? You know, arrive at work separately? No, it's all right. I'm too hungover to walk. No. I don't "know her" know her. Like, I only met her here. Do you know where she is? Did she mention any men at all? Like a teacher? My father teaches at my school. Do any of you know a Mr. Kenton Marshall? Try the store cupboard. In case he's doing Alexa again. This is really important because she could be in trouble. Look, I don't know where she is. But when I first ran away, I stayed with mates. Yeah? Till they started getting sick of me or wanted something back. Maybe she's doing the same. All that back there, about Alexa. It's just gossip. - Hi. - Hey. Sorry I missed your call. My phone died. Oh, Karl. There's your girlfriend. Hey. - Did I miss anything last night? - No. Good. Don't ask. OK, this is the route that Marosi confessed to. So if we assume that he was trying to put the investigation off, then Jesse couldn't have gone that way because of Slade and Pru. I guess this is the area that we need to be focusing on. - Ally? - What's the appeal? Parents? Kids? Why put yourself through it? Love, duty, genetic hardwiring. What's the alternative? Oh, I don't know. Self-fulfilment, world travel, career advancement. Hey, at least I get a lie-in. Danny. Danny! Danny! Listen. You do not go in there on your own. Remember what happened last year? - Last year? - Last year? His friend's little brother went missing from here. Terrible. You worked on that case, didn't you? Jakob Marosi. That's right. Nasty piece of work. Yeah, we're on something similar at the moment. A missing kid. Could still be alive if we get to him in time. I'd love to take a look through those files. Nothing in them. Marosi's inside. Yeah, I know, but the line of inquiry could be useful. Mm. Off the record, his parents are going spare. Imagine if it were Danny. I hid them in my basement. Hey. What did you do that for? Daniel! How many times? Nice try, but we don't have a basement. Listen, when we get home, you put that in the shed and leave it there. No kicking it against Nana's dresser again. - OK? - OK. Let's go. Ah, he kept Nana's dresser in the basement. Of our old house. Come on. OK, road trip, everybody! Hey. I'm here. - I brought food. - Thank you so much. I've got you some apples and a couple of sandwiches. Thank you. OK. So I have to go back to class now. Thank you. Alexa? Get out! - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait. - Get out! - Alexa. Alexa. - Get off! - Alexa, my name's Mark. - Get out! I help down at the shelter sometimes. With Slade. You know Slade, right? Remember Slade? - Yeah? - Yeah. Where is he? Our friend died and he had to go away. Look at me. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm not gonna hurt you. I'm here to help you. I'm here to protect you. From Payne. - And Kenton. - What do you know about Kenton? I've been hired by Kenton's family to help find him. - My father's gone missing. - Simon needs a father. He needs his routine. I appreciate everything you've been doing looking for Kenton. All part of the ex-lover service. But I heard about the two of you. What he's been doing to you. - What are you talking about? - He's in a position of authority and you're underage. Do you think... - No. - It's not your fault. Kenton's my dad. If Kenton is your father, Alexa, do you know where he is? No. I don't mean to be harsh, but his family never mentioned you. They don't know about me. I didn't even know till last week. Mr. Marshall... Dad, had a thing with my mum back in the day. She got pregnant. He didn't want to know. She never really talked about it and last year she put me in that school. My mum was afraid something might happen to her. And it did. She got killed. Murdered. Alexa, I want to help you. I'm a friend. OK? Why? Why do you want to help me? My brother disappeared 20 years ago. His DNA... turned up at your mum's murder scene. What? We thought we had him back. And you think it could be him? But it turned out we were wrong. This isn't Jesse. And I don't know if he was a witness or if he was trying to help your mum, but her... him... you, Kenton... Somehow it's all connected. Well... - This is it. - Just in time for dinner. You should stay here. It's gonna be weird enough without my mad dad, my kid and you. Lucky me. Oi! Hi. Sorry to bother you. This is gonna sound a little weird. I'm a police officer. It's nothing to worry about. My family used to live here. And my dad... I think my dad might have left something in your basement. Are you Danny? Come in. But the holiday's been booked for months! - You know how important this case is! - Get off her! Oh! Get out! Run! We kept your measurements. Oh, yeah. We just felt it gave the place a bit of character. I've always wanted kids of my own, but... Glyn's like... You're gonna need a torch if you're going in the basement. Do you mind if I... Glyn is gonna hate this. Right. I just need you a bit more... Right. Just... Stay very still. - That's great. - OK. Great, great, great. So, um, can we um... Oh, yeah, sorry. I get really claustrophobic so I'm gonna leave the basement to you. She gave me this a few weeks ago. It's got files on it. Of all the people they ever scammed. She made me a video. I hope we're watching this together and laughing. That's when she told me about my real dad. His name is Kenton Marshall. That's why I've sent you to that school. In case you ever need him. He's a good man. He will look after you. I didn't have nowhere else to go. I didn't know how he was gonna react. If he'd even recognise her after all these years. But he did. And he looked at me and he knew. I showed him Mum's video. They would have forced you into their scams, Alexa. So I tried to get out. That's why Dominic Porter had me killed. You have to get as far away from here as possible. This memory stick is evidence linking Porter to the scams. If anyone comes after you, you tell them you've got the file somewhere safe. Porter won't kill you if he thinks he could get exposed. Ask Kenton to help you. He wanted to call the police, but she said not to. Porter's got a guy on the inside. They'll bury the evidence and make you disappear. He told me to go to my mum's place and wait for him to come and get me. I was careful but there was this guy in a yellow car. What did he look like? Where are the files? It all happened so fast. I fought back. My mum always made me carry rape spray. That's when he broke my arm. I ran but I didn't know where to go. I'd heard about this shelter for homeless kids. It was the closest place I could think of. And that is when I met Slade. - Are you all right? - Please help me. Shh. It's all right. It's all right. You're safe. He was cool... And then my phone started ringing. I didn't pick it up. I didn't know who it was. And he left a message. Alexa, it's me. Look, I know you're scared. But I've thought about what your mum said and I didn't call the police. I guess there's no point in going public if we don't have to. We can't just run, though. So I tracked down Dominic Porter. If he wants that information back, I'm gonna offer it to him, but only if he leaves you alone. I'm gonna meet him at a hotel called the Old Town. I had no idea what to do so I told Slade everything. And he went to the hotel to help Dad. Slade went to the Old Town Hotel? He said he'd only be a couple of hours but he was... three, four. I got scared so I came here. I just want to know what happened in that hotel. I just want to know what happened to my dad. Slade, it's me. I've found Alexa. She's scared. She needs to know what's going on. So do I. So can you call me, please? - Have you got children? - No. - Boyfriend? - No. Girlfriend? - Why not? - Cause I'm happy as I am. All right? OK. In this job, it's the best way to be. No distractions. No one to worry about. Just the case. Lorraine always used to hate that house, when we lived here. - Drive safe. - Thanks. She looks terrified. Is it to do with her teacher? It's a long story. And to think we nearly sent our daughter to that school. Is it Slade? Uh, no. No, it's not. No. Hey, can I call you back in a bit? Uh, no, Mark. Simon's having a really bad day. Do you mind talking to him for a minute? Mum, he doesn't do anything. - Just give me a sec. OK? - Mm. - You all right, Alexa? - Yeah. I'm gonna go for a cigarette. OK. How are you doing after last night? Yeah. You know, fine. I don't have a lot of time. OK. I'm gonna put you on speaker phone. - Hey, Simon. - Why haven't you found my Dad? - Your Dad's alive. - What? If you want to see him, come with me. But... Who are you? - Does it matter? - I shouldn't just go. One word, I make the call, he dies. Move. Alexa? Alexa! Alexa! What are you doing here? Where's she taken her? Who is she? - She works for Porter. - You work for Porter! Not anymore. I know where they're going. Get in! Come on, we're gonna lose them. - Get in. - I've been calling you. - Where the hell have you been? - I got your message. What is that? And this? Hm, Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad! They're what you were wearing on that day. Daniel! You were so... destructive. When we'd argue... - Daniel! Come back here! - Ray! You'd get so upset... Smashing things... with that bat. It was past midnight when you got back. But you wouldn't say where you'd been. You wouldn't say... anything. So... Where were you, Daniel? Where'd you go after you'd run out? Alexa. Do you remember me? I used to help out your mum. Where's my dad? Oh, that is cold. Oh, no, your dad's dead. Bring her inside. If Porter gets what he wants, he'll kill her. The memory stick. - How do you know about that? - She told me everything. Get in there. I believe you have something that belongs to me. I don't know what you're talking about. Who are you? Why do you even care? It's just the kind of guys that we are. OK? - Bullshit. - Say that again. Says a wannabe pimp. Alexa is like a daughter to me. She's already got a dad and his name's Kenton Marshall. Your mother tried to blackmail me with information I owned. That's why she's dead. Yeah, it's all there. Check the file details. She's made a copy. And your daddy told us you had it. Before we killed him too. Right, I'll go around the front and cause a diversion. Diversion? - Surely we have to call the police. - There's no time. You've got to go over the fence and through that door at the back. Find her and bring her out. The entry code's two-seven-six-nine. You got "two-seven". I've got "six-nine". Slade, come on. I've got a daughter just like you. She swears she doesn't smoke. - Ow. - But I can smell it on her. Make sure it's all there. Oh, what is this guy, a Bond villain? More like a footballer. Jesus. - Where have you been all this time? - Come on. Slade. Shit. When did you become Bruce Willis? This is ridiculous. It's encrypted. It would be a shame to hurt you. Oh, shit. - Mark, what were your two numbers? - What do you mean, my two numbers? - Your numbers. What were they? - I wasn't listening. Oh, shit: 69? No, I had 69. Remember? I'd remember 69. It's funny. Tell me the encryption code! Slade, come on. Six-nine-two-seven. Oh, shit! What's going on? Ah... Two men coming through the back door! She must have been followed. Shawn. Do you hear me? - Oh, shit. - Other way round. Two-seven-six-nine. Two-seven-six-nine. Turn that bloody sound off! Holy shit! He's got an actual Batcave. Ow! Who are they? Look. What are we doing? We keep moving. We just hope that Payne knows what he's doing. Who are they? I've got one, boss. - What are you doing here? - I'm here for my girl. Why are you still here? Go and help find the others. That was a gun. What if they shot Payne? Then we find Alexa ourselves. Come on. Look, you go that way. OK. Let's go. Go, go, go, go. We'll be fine. Why are you in my house? What took you so long? Who are you with? - Who are you with? - Got one more! - You? - Who is he? He was poking around my office. What are you, hm? Selena's boyfriend? Brother? It doesn't matter. Just let her go. OK? Do you want me to call off the police? No. No need. They'll see I was acting in self-defence. Two men break into my home... Armed. One of my men tries to stop them... and they killed him. Jeez! Oh my God... Hey. In the ensuing struggle, I manage to disarm them and then kill them myself. Unless you give me the code for the memory stick. It's your only way out. Please. Please. You see him? He almost tied your whore mother to me by getting himself caught. That's how much I want this to be over. So give me the codes. Listen to me, Alexa. Just... Just give him the code. OK? Don't know it, Slade. No, it's fine. You've got no choice. Just give him the code. - He's right, you know. - It'll be fine. It's my birthday. It's my birthday. It's zero-six-zero-seven. Now! Who did you send to kill Selena? My brother's DNA was at the murder scene. Who did you send? Who did you send? - Oh, my God! - It's all right. - Whoa. - It's all right. It's all right. It's OK. - Oh, Jesus. - You've got to go. - No. No. - Yes. I'll wipe the CCTV. - You were never here. - What about you? No. No. No. No. No, no, no. It's better if they get me. Or they'll come after you. And that's not what we wanted for your future. "We?" You helped... You helped my mum? You set it up with my mum so I'd meet my dad? - No. - Get her out of here. - No. - Come on. Alexa, come on. - No, please! Please, please, please. - Alexa, we have to go. Look... My name is Mark Wells. - I'm a solicitor. - Mark! When you get to the police station, call me. All right? I'll represent you. It's OK. Everything's gonna be all right. How's it gonna be all right? Hm? Cause my mum's dead, my dad's dead and the only other person who's ever cared about me is going to prison. I'm sorry. Where are we going? It's over. Alexa's in the van. You can go home now. This is Alexa. This is Laura. Hello. Can I give you a hug? We did good, Mark. You're gonna have to tell me everything. OK. Help! It all started with Alexa coming into the shelter. She was terrified. And she told me everything. The man in the yellow car who had hurt her. About Porter. About her mother. Heard her father's message about wanting to meet them. But these people, Mark, they don't play nice. Kenton was walking into a trap. So I went to the hotel, but I got there too late. I saw this guy park up. It was the same yellow car Alexa said she saw and I knew it was him. So I followed him in. I searched the body, found his phone and texted Porter that the job had been done so they'd think Kenton was dead and then saved his number onto my phone. I wrapped the body up and I moved his car around the back. And I waited until dark to get the body out. And then I hid Kenton in a safe house, which is when Laura's son came to you and you got involved. Payne attacked you. We tracked him down to Porter & Starr. The same company Selena worked for. I saw him in there with Porter. They were arguing. And now I know it was over Alexa. And Porter wanted to use her in his scams. She's a child. Payne was trying to protect her. And the rest you know. You knew about the whole thing. You let me follow this trail and you knew where it was gonna lead. You had all the answers and you pretended that you didn't. Why would you do that? Who did you send? I saw you with Porter then and you wanted to kill him. And that's what happens, Mark. OK? And I can't... I don't want you becoming me. - What does that mean? - It means I'm not gonna lose you. OK? I can't. You all right? Yeah, I'm OK. Slade, you've killed. You've killed somebody. - And, Slade... - Shh... You killed someone. And all this seems to have been since Jesse's name came back up. It just seems to be death and murder, and it's just... I'm tired, man. I know. And if all this isn't enough... The studio where the girls were kept... They found Jesse's DNA at Newman's crime scene. Maybe Jesse killed Newman. That's impossible. How do you know? Because I killed Newman. Subtitles by explosiveskull
