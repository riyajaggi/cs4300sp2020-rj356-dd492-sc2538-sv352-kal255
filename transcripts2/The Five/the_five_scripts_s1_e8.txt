 Subtitles by explosiveskull [Mark] My mum's house was broken into last night. [Julie] He was in Jesse's room looking through family photos. - Couldn't see his face. - It was Jesse. I chose him, I took him and I killed him. Three acts. I'm convinced you didn't. Whatever happened, it wasn't our fault. - Did you set out to kill Newman? - Newman destroyed girls' lives. They found something else in Newman's garden. [Danny] The same picture book Jesse had. Makes no sense. It's a reprint from ten years after Jesse disappeared.

 - Sleep with him? - Nothing happened. Moving back was the worst thing we did! [Mark] Today I was in the woods. This guy was watching me. [Pru] Mark! How many exits are there to this building? Danny. - There's no-one up there. - I'm just chasing someone. Someone is setting us up. - [Ally] What is it? - Jakob Marosi wants to see me. [Family] Thank you for the food we eat. Thank you for the world so sweet. Thank you for the birds that sing. Thank you, God, for everything. God bless us. God bless the food.

 Amen. Oh, we got a letter from the Missionary Society thanking us for the donation. I'll let you have a look. It came yesterday. Here we are. [suspenseful music] Before anything, can I apologise for the way I spoke to you last time? It's unacceptable. And I'm sorry. You said there is something you want to show us. Yes. I want to show you where Jesse Wells is buried. Oh, yeah? Why? Why are you offering this now? [Marosi sighs] This last week... I'm reliving how I killed this boy. I dream it when I sleep. And it comes when I am awake. It's constant. And for the first time, I see the dreadful thing I did all those years ago. The worst a man can do. For any child. And their parents. And when you realise that, well... the least I can do is... offer some closure for the family. And perhaps for myself as well. That's lovely. You say you want to show us where Jesse is buried? - Yes. - Why not just tell us? It was 20 years ago. But I will know when I see it. It was among the sand dunes up the coast. Where they train the horses. I think someone wants a day at the seaside. I want the parents to have their child back. Relive it. You're reliving it every night. Relive it now. Where is he buried? I'll tell you what I do remember of this burial. When I'm laying his tiny body in the ground, he's wearing a red jacket with a hood. It slipped off his shoulder. And as I pulled it up, I see a name tag. On the inside. There. And it says, "Mark Wells." And until I saw the news reports, that was who I thought I had killed. [Hayley] I can't move my jaw. I mean, I can, but... it feels like I can't. - And then... - OK. OK. It's OK, Hayley. Hayley, look at me. It's OK. You've got to breathe. Breathe. OK. Everything is fine. OK? The benzodiazepines I have given you are gonna kick in. You're gonna feel fine, but you've got to breathe. [breathing] OK, good girl. I think you might have to consider the fact that MDMA and you don't mix. Nah, we mix fine. It's just... once in a while, that's all. Who cares? Look at Britnay. We can die at any time. We can die just like that. So why stop anything? Just try and take care of yourself today, Hayley. OK? Drink lots of water. Any chance I could get a few more of those benzies? You cheeky monkey, get out. Why are you asking this? We just review the evidence in every case after a couple of weeks. So, to the best of your knowledge, when Jesse went out that day - he was wearing...? - A red hoodie, jeans and a t-shirt. - [Ally] Tell us about the hoodie. - Well, it was a hand-me-down. It wasn't new. It was Mark's originally. It had been washed for ever. - Did it have a name tag? - No. You only ever label your first kid's clothes. The rest can go... No, hold on. It would have had Mark's name tag on it. That would still be there cause it was a sew-in one, not stick-on. Why are you interested in it? Like I said, it's just procedure. - [knocking] - Yeah? - Hi, can I have a word? - Yeah, course. Come in. - You got mail. - Ooh. Must be a fixture. Oh. - You all right? - Yeah. Yeah. No, I am fine. I... I got called out at... 3:34. And then I went to work and then I came straight here, so I'm a bit spaced. Right. Um... Yes, I was speaking with Hayley earlier. Do you know Hayley? Yeah, course you do. Well, she was talking about... Britnay. But in a really nihilistic way. Like, "Why bother with anything? What's the point?" "What happened to Britnay could happen to everyone else." I just thought you should know. We really missed you, Slade. I haven't dealt with this at all, have I? [chatter] [music starts] Come on! Up we get! There you go. Come on, up on your feet. Come on. There we go. This way. ["Poison Arrow" by ABC] [Slade] That's it. There we go. No way! [lively chatter and music] ♪ If I were to say to you ♪ ♪ Can you keep a secret? ♪ ♪ Would you know just what to do Or where to keep it? ♪ ♪ Then I say I love you ♪ - ♪ Foul the situation... ♪ - [ringtone] Slade, sorry. I got a... Hi, Stuart. What? Airport? What do you mean? You can't just take her. [music in background] ♪ Shoot that poison arrow to my heart ♪ ♪ Shoot that poison arrow ♪ ♪ Shoot that poison arrow to my heart ♪ ♪ Shoot that poison arrow ♪ - [music drowns speech] - ♪ No rhythm in cymbals ♪ ♪ No tempo in drums... ♪ Excuse me, mate. Is that your van outside? Yeah. Can you just give me two minutes, please? Would you just... We're doing this... - Look, listen, please. - [music stops] - [Slade] What's this about? - [Policeman] Step outside straightaway. Come with me outside. [shouting] [a kid] What are you doing? I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder. [livery chatter] - Suspicion of murdering who? - Jay Newman. - You've got the wrong man, pal. - Can you sort the kids out, please? - It's all right, it's fine. - Go back inside. [intriguing music] [Marosi] Here. Here. Wait. [Danny] Mr Marosi, specific directions, please. It's been 20 years. The landscape changes. This way. Come. [intriguing music] What's all this about? What's happened? Slade, what have you been arrested for? It's in connection with the Jay Newman murder. Are you out of your mind calling me in? Who was I supposed to call, Mark? - Slade, I know. You've told me. - [door opens] - That's yours. - Thank you. Before we get started, can I just confirm that... you're investigating a murder of a Mr Jay Newman at his home on Manville Avenue on the afternoon of the 22nd of this month? That's correct. The client's van matches, or is similar to, a van seen outside Mr Newman's address at the estimated time of death. [Mark] I just want to confirm. This is important. The 22nd of this month? - The 22nd. - I'm gonna have to halt proceedings. I can't be a solicitor on this case. You see, on the afternoon of the 22nd... my client was with me. What do you mean "with" you? At my place, my apartment. Early morning till late evening. He was with me. The whole time. An alibi was above and beyond, Mark. Thank you. I appreciate it. Don't thank me. OK, Slade, you do my head in. You really do. If you're so smart, what's gonna happen to the kids in the shelter if you go to prison? You getting picked up is proof enough that your actions do have consequences. And they've got your DNA now. So you'd really better hope that you were careful enough. [gulls squawking] Here. It's here. Are you sure? I feel it. OK. This is our spot. Let's get to digging. [Ally] Bring it in, guys. Nice wind. That sun. Warm. Great. [pop music in background] Hello. Hi. [gulls squawking] [police radio chatter] [Danny] Something isn't right, Ally. It's a wind-up. Look at him. [music drowns chat] Would you mind if I pop to the ladies? ♪ Think I can fly ♪ ♪ Think I can fly when I'm with you ♪ ♪ My arms are wide ♪ ♪ Catching fire as the wind blows ♪ ♪ I want to run away ♪ Another drink, then? Cheers. To new friends. [song becomes distorted] Let's get some fresh air. You'll be fine. Don't worry. Hey, how's it going? The lady's with me. You what? Go and sit down. What's your problem? [gasping] - It's OK. - Come on. - Pru. Jesus. - He took her... - He took her while I was here. - Pru, sit down. - He took her. - Jesus. I called Nico at the airport. They were about to get on the flight. So you thought you'd take some more pills? Hmm? Diazepam. I can tell, Pru. I can see it in your eyes. Half the kids here are on it. That's how I know. - I'm gonna call Mark. - No, you're not. He's gonna listen to me. - Give me the phone. - I love him. I love Mark. No, you'll get over it, Pru. I got over you. I thought I was in love with you. Now look at me. Nothing. Not a pang. You don't understand. OK. I've always loved Mark. And I'm gonna call him. - And I'm gonna tell him. - Pru. - Look at you. Look at you. - Ow! Look at you! You're fucked up, Pru. Now, you listen to me, until you're unfucked-up, you leave Mark well alone. I am not having you going on some off-your-faced whim only to go and break his heart all over again. I won't have it, because that is exactly what you did last time. And don't you dare think that just cos we were kids that it didn't mean anything. He never got over you, Pru. [sighs] Before you even think about calling him, just get yourself clean, Pru. Sort yourself out. DS Kenwood, we've got something. What? What have you got? - Just down there. - What is it? Get out of the way. [police radio chatter] Are you sure you want to be here for this? Yeah. I'm just... figuring out what I'm gonna tell Julie and Alan. And Mark. Danny. They have to run some tests, but... Judging by the remnants of clothes, and the hair, and the shoe... - Yeah? - This is a little girl. - What? - Well, it's... it's a young girl. It can't be Jesse. What do you mean, it's a...? [Marosi] Oh, that's right. That's the little Reddington girl. You are as useless as your father. Danny! Get off me! Get him down the station. Bastard! [phone buzzes] I think you might have actually chased a real person. Danny, I think I'm losing my mind. If you're losing it, I'm losing it. But if I was chasing someone, that means they disappeared. - They evaporated. - I know. [Danny] We find Jesse's DNA at the place where the girls were kept. We also find the Gulliver's Travel picture book there. Yeah, but it's a 2005 reprint. Right. Then your mum and dad's gets broken into. I mean... either Jesse is still alive... or this is some massive hoax. And if it's a hoax? I think Jakob Marosi is behind this. He's inside. It's not possible. How could he do that? - You think he's working people? - I've got no idea. What I do know is that he is the sickest bastard that I have ever come across. And if he can wind you up, he will. Marosi used to write letters to my dad from prison. What? - Why didn't you tell me this before? - I'm sorry. I just... Listen, that's not even possible. He's a Category-A prisoner. They wouldn't allow him to write to victims. Well, he did. Unless he was getting someone to do it for him. [Alan] You two still here? - Dad, come on. - How many letters did you get? What part don't you understand? I don't want to talk about it. At all. Quite clear? Here we are. Danny, come on. Let's go. [Julie] He burnt them all as they came in. This one he just forgot the envelope. Mum, did you read the letters? I saw bits of some of them. Alan never gave them to me. They made him so mad. Same printed address on each letter, by the way. He had them made with one of those rubber stamps. Every letter I did see went on about there being three acts. Don't know what that meant but those two words would fill a whole page sometimes. "Three acts." When did he get these? Quite early on. Ninety-eight, '99. Maybe ten letters in all. What, Danny? What is it? There's a postmark. [whirring] New lead. Alan Wells, circa 1998, received letters purportedly from Jakob Marosi. No, he burned them. And he won't talk about them. But we do have one of the envelopes postmarked from Malten, which is 120 miles south of here, but six miles from where Marosi was imprisoned in 1998. I haven't finished. From March, 1997 till he was moved up here in 2000, Jakob Marosi's only prison visitor was an Angela Clark, who lives then and now in Malten. That's her. Fancy a drive? Shouldn't we run all of this past the DI first? The envelope is in the forensics bag. Get it to Ken and tell him I want everything and anything PDQ. - What does that even mean? - Oh, look, here's his boyfriend. You can take it down to him. Ally's got something for you. I'm gonna go and get my jacket. Hi. Um... This is for Ken. It's urgent. Do I need to apologise for the other night? To me? I doubt it. I usually get everything I deserve. No, I... I think I do. I... - Um... - I mean, - you could always... - Ally, we gotta go. - I'll... - Ally, please. - [Danny] Welcome to Malten. - I think it's this one. - [Danny] Angela Clark? - Yes. DS Kenwood, DC Caine. Do you mind if we have a word inside? [Mr Clark] Would anyone like a cup of tea? [Danny] No. Actually, I'd like Mrs Clark to answer my questions. [Ally] Actually, yes, I would. Thanks. Milk, one sugar. [Ally] OK, so let's try again, shall we? When you were a prison visitor to Jakob Marosi, did you ever send letters on his behalf? Did you think there was something I wouldn't say in front of my husband? Is there? No. Mrs Clark, did Jakob Marosi ever ask you to smuggle letters out for him? That wouldn't be allowed. That's not an answer to the question. Angela, if you refuse to cooperate, you'll be down at the station in the morning. Could we make that the afternoon? We go to church Sunday mornings. Mrs Clark, please. Someone posted letters to the father of one of the children Jakob Marosi claims to have murdered. They were posted from this town. Did you post those letters? I know one thing for certain. Jakob has repented his sins. He has redeemed himself and now rejoices in the love of Jesus. Mm-hm. Do you know what Jakob Marosi did to his victims? - To children? - Of course. He confessed all his crimes to me. But draw closer to God and he will draw closer to you. Jakob Marosi is a vicious psychopath, Mrs Clark. He was possessed. He... He was possessed. Sorry, by who? The devil? Yes, of course. [Mrs Clark] But through redemption he is saved. Yes. You don't believe and so it's impossible for you to understand. You know, sorry, Mrs Clark, I have to say, I've been face to face with Jakob Marosi a number of times and he is the most unrepentant, manipulative criminal I've ever had the misfortune to meet. We fight the devil with his own weapons. I'm sorry, are you saying that I'm an emissary for the devil? Milk and sugar? We don't have enough to go any further. We'll never get a warrant, and if we did, what would we look for? A rubber address stamp? Imagine putting that to the DI. Yeah. So we drop it, yeah? I'm not saying there's nothing in it. I'd put a week's pay on her having posted those letters. There was something in that cupboard she didn't want us to see. But we haven't got any evidence. Danny, I'm not moving from this spot until you say we drop it. Yeah, yeah, we drop it. You've been asleep for ages. Thanks. I feel like shit. Sleeping Beauty's first words. [she groans] I've got your stash, by the way. It was very neat in that pen. Very neat. I'll be keeping that in case you were wondering. I'm a complete mess. Stuart has just taken Nico away without even asking me. Stop feeling sorry for yourself and get clean. If you're serious, the best way to do that is to stay here with me. OK? OK. They won't be back from the States till the end of the week. And, Slade... I heard what you said. Last night, about Mark. And I hate excuses. Feel there's a but coming. It's a good one. Do you want to hear it? [chuckles] Go on, then. Seriously, what happened to me, you, Danny and Mark... didn't we all go missing the day Jesse disappeared? What happened to those kids that spent every single moment together up until that point? Anyone ever see them again? I don't think so. We were never those kids again. And you were all right, you had each other. I got taken to the States. No-one knew what happened... OK, stop right there. You're back now, Pru. You're not alone. We will figure this out together. OK? Thank you. - Thank you. - [kiss] [phone rings] [music in background] Danny. Unexpected pleasure. Look, I... I don't know if I'm asking you for advice or for help. Right. Um... Look, it's about Jesse. It's about finding out whether he's alive or dead. [Pru] Slade, why have we stopped? I thought I was taking you to some youth workers' conference thing. No, I made that up. No, I didn't tell you this because you'd just ask questions all the way here, but... the family from that house there are gonna go to church in a minute. And I want you to go with them. And then... I want you to call me when they set off to come back home. - Why? Where are you going? - I'm gonna break in for Danny. - What? - I'm not gonna steal anything. I'm just gonna look around cause the lady from that house has posted letters to Alan from Jakob Marosi. Oh, look. The mum and kids are leaving the house now. Well, where's the dad? - No. Where's the dad? - There he is. Look. I'll go, shall I? Say a little prayer for me.

I am feeling fearful today. Life seems uncertain - and out of control. - [mutters] I recall that the Bible tells me, "Perfect love casts out fear." - I've left the potatoes on. - You alone are perfect love. The fear I feel. [suspenseful music] [keys] [stairs creaking] Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh, thank you. I am so blessed. [Priest] Therefore this is what the Lord says. "You will not leave the bed you are lying on. You will certainly die." So Elijah went. When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them... Slade? Slade, the husband's not here. I think he might be on his way. Thanks for the warning. OK. All of us together in one room at the same time. - It's nice, huh? - [Mark] Let's just get on with this. What are we waiting for? - It's uploading, be patient. - What are we looking for? Well, if this woman was sending letters from Marosi, I don't know, anything from '98 or '99. [intriguing music] [Mark] OK. OK. I think I've got something. Come and have a look at this. Right, so these are... annual bills for a storage facility. And it's right here in Westbridge. And not only that, it's right around the corner from where Marosi used to live. And since 1998, it's been paid for by Ms Angela Clark who lives 120 miles away in Malten. Wow. OK. What is it, Dan? What's wrong? It's me, I'm what's wrong. I've stopped thinking. I can't... I can't use these. How do I use this? OK, you go along to unit 92. You open it up. You see what's inside. OK? Get a search warrant. It's easy. - But I can't do that. - Why? Because when they ask me, "How did you get these invoices?" Which they will ask. That's the first thing they will ask. What do I say, hm? How do I answer? I can't answer, because I can't use this. Yeah, he's right. OK, you're right. You're right. So leave it to us, OK? - No... - No, listen. You leave it to me. Right? We delete the files that we've just uploaded, OK? Yeah, Danny. You're not involved in this. All right? You haven't seen this. We haven't even talked about it. All right? This does not exist. So you, Danny, - you go and be a policeman. - Yeah. And you go and investigate something. - What are you gonna do? - We might go greyhound racing. - Now, listen. - It's not funny. If we find anything, then it will be delivered magically to you anonymously. OK? Good. Now, off you go, come on. [knocking] Can I help you? 24/7 access. 24/7 security. - We have CCTV, alarms... - [plane flying overhead] We're right in the flight path of the airport. What's available? - Bit of block one. All of block two. - We'll take 101. [intriguing music] [clattering] Ah, the... the spirally thing, it turned, but... nothing dropped out. It's the Seabrooks. Thanks, mate. [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music continues] [plane passing overhead] [Mark] Found anything? [Slade] Hey, mate, what's that? [Mark] A massive chain. [suspenseful music continues] Oh, Jesus. [Mark] Look at these tapes. [sighs] [Mark] "Connor Tresco, 28th of July, 1993. Seven years old." [Slade] "Act one. Target. Act two. Pain. Act three. Kill." "Billy Taylor, 23rd of June, 1984. Eight years old." Jesus. [Slade] It's the same. Act one. Act two. Act three. [clicking] Jesus, Danny, you dick. - What are you doing? - What have we got? [Slade] Close the door. - [Slade] Found a trunk. - [Danny] These are kids' teeth. [Slade] Teeth? We've got hair. We've got tapes that say "Act one. Act two. Act three." - [Slade] "Connor Tresco." - Guys. - [buzzing] - [Slade] What is it? Mark, what is it?
