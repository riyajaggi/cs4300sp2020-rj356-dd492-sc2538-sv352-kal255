 Bro, give me your car keys. -In my pocket. What for? -I'm buying trays. We're out. There's weed and merguez left to pack. Damn. Be careful with the car! Ali! [quietly to himself] Shit. Go on. Take the van for a tray. Take my car. ♪ Strange business if you ask me ♪ Come on! [hip-hop music continues] Are you guys done yet? Yes. Just waiting for the trays. -Ready in two hours. -Awesome.

 No, Clem. We made a deal with Jaurès. [scoffs] That fucking deal, yeah. KOSHER MERGUEZ A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES ♪ Family ♪ ♪ Business ♪ All good? Got all the weed? Yeah, it's all here. We can load the merguez. -Okay, they're coming. -Don't drive like idiots. We've done this before. You never know with you guys. I'll call you once we're done. Come on, Olive. -Let's go with the merguez. -[Olivier] You're not carrying 40 kilos. -I'm here. Give me. -[Olivier] Here! -[Joseph] Watch my fingers. Perfect. -[Olivier grunts] Okay, one last palette of merguez and we're off. [hip-hop music continues] [Olivier] Shit. No way. That fucking freeloader is always there. HAZAN KOSHER MEATS -Hello, Gaëtan. How are you? -Okay. I'll be better once I've eaten. Yeah, I'm sure. So, what are you schlepping around today? Only great things. Really? -Should I show you what we have? -Okay. -Should we do that, Gaëtan? -Okay, let's do it. [Olivier groans] So, what do I have for you? Really good merguez. -Do you like quality? -Oh, yeah. Yup. Look at these beauties. They're nice, fresh, and gleaming. Like a young bride. [all laughing] Put them on the grill for ten minutes and never do what? Never pierce them. Like always. Well done, Gaëtan. -All right, men. -Thanks a lot. Good day. -Bye. -Bye, guys. -[Joseph] Enjoy. -[Gaëtan] Thanks. [Joseph] Dumbass. [crows squawking] [keeper] I cleaned everything, put all your papers back like on the old one. I see. [Gérard inhales deeply, sighs] Thank you very much. This is for you. -No, listen, I couldn't. -Yes, I insist. There. This way I know you'll take good care of my Béné. -I'll check on her every day. -That's kind. [chuckles] [chuckles] Remember when we fell in love with this? With this, at Juan-Les-Pins? [chuckles] We were dreaming. We thought it wasn't meant for us. [tuts, inhales deeply] Well... I found it. And I think soon I'm gonna be able to buy it for us. Well, now it's called "The Duke," but I... I'll rename it "My Béné." That way... we'll always travel together. BÉNÉDICTE HAZAN BORN ROSENBERG 1953-2018 [inhales deeply] [Joseph] What's that? Huh? [sniffs] Is that love? [sniffs] Is that love? That's shit. Wow! Oh... Ooh, shoot! -I put all the bottles here for you. -[Joseph] Mwah, mwah. -I'm talking to you. -Yeah, I'm listening. [Aïda] I put the bottles here. The diapers, pacifiers, and saline are in the bag. My love, sorry to interrupt. Really, I can handle it. No problem. Don't call me that. -Habit, sorry. -[Aïda] I've said 1,000 times. Don't act like I'm paranoid. I don't know many moms who'd leave their kids -with a dealer tied to the Mafia. -[laughing] No... The Mafia. Like on 20/20. "Welcome to an unexpected world where prostitution, gambling, and also... the Mafia intermingle." [laughs] Funny. You're right. My love, we're farmers. We grow and sell. That's all. Well, tonight, take them home. -Yep. -[Aïda] Spend tonight with your family. Bring them back before 10:00 p.m. Okay? My love, ten is early. I only see them once a week. I'll bring them tomorrow morning. It's better for them. So they'll stay with your family? Never! They're crazy! [Joseph] They need to see them. I'm their father. That's their family. I'll be back at seven. I want to see them before dinner. [door slams shut] That's crazy. Your mother's difficult. She's really difficult. But I love her. Come on, baby doll. Who wants to do a little bouncing in her poopy pants? My girl! Daddy's gonna make some coffee and then he'll change you. How are you, my darlings? You're good. That's good, sweetheart. -[doorbell rings] -Yes? What did you forget? Honestly, I don't agree with the schedule. I told you. It's... -What are you doing here? -You told me to come help you. I told you to come help me at seven to bring back the kids. I told you to wait downstairs. Did you run into Aïda? You're crazy, man. I came in, hugged the walls. -I'm cool. -Okay, come in. -[shouting] Hi! -Ah! Fuck! Clem, please don't scream. You're gonna get me in trouble. -There you go. Happy? -[Olivier] I'll handle it. Clem, don't scream like that with kids around. I didn't scream, Joseph. So, my little Noam, are you happy to see Uncle Olive? Huh? Why uncle? He's not your real brother, you know? Oh, God. Don't listen to that person, please. Olivier is like my brother, so he's your real uncle. So, Ibrahim, come give Auntie Clem a hug. Hey, hey. No, I'd rather you didn't, okay? She's digesting. And also, that's not Ibrahim. That's Alia. -Oh, yeah? -[Joseph] Yeah. Are you sure? -What kind of question's that? -Why did you bring her? -I was with her. I can't just leave her. -The kids don't take to her. -I want them to get used to each other. -Later. Now's not the time. [cell phone ring tone] It's Jaurès. -Is there a problem? -[Joseph] I don't know. It's weird she's calling. I have a bad feeling. You're an idiot. Answer it. What are you doing with... -Okay, pick up! -I am! [clears throat] Hello? [Jaurès] Hi, Joseph. I'm missing a tray. [Joseph] Okay. [Jaurès] Bring it over. -[Joseph] How? -[Jaurès] What? Bring it now. -[Joseph] That's strange because... -[Jaurès] Is there a problem? -Uh... No. No problem. -[Clémentine speaking baby talk] [Joseph] It's just that... Later then. At the usual spot. See you. What did she say? She said we forgot a tray from this morning's delivery -and she wants me to bring it now. -No. [sighs] What do I do with the kids? -I'll go. -No. Please. Absolutely not. Joseph has to handle the deliveries. That's the deal with Jaurès. Jo, let's do as usual. I'll come with you. That doesn't help. Who's gonna watch the kids? -I'll watch them for you! -Absolutely not. I'm used to it. I've done cat-sitting. -Come on. Close the curtains. -I love kids... and kids love me. -[baby cries] -What? You got red wine on her! Are you crazy or what? [Joseph] You have to be really stupid to buy a dealer car when you're a dealer. You really have to have nothing between your ears. We'll get pulled over with your redneck paint job. Hey, I got him that paint job, so back off. Yeah, stop freaking out. It's camouflage. We're invisible. We're invisible. Look. Three engine lights. We're gonna break down. It's nothing. It's like yellow lights. No one cares. This car works really well. What do you know, anyway? Idiot. [menacing music playing] -Where is it? -In the back to the left. [clanging in distance] -What are you doing? -I'm playing the kids' mom so we blend in. Let go. No one's here. Maybe there are cameras. [sighs] You have to stop bringing her. -[baby moaning] -Damn it. They're waking up. Sleep, Ibra. Sleep. Were you able to bring what was missing? Fucking son of a bitch. Shh. If we could just lower our-- Your kids aren't my problem. Do you want me to breastfeed them too? No. He already ate, but that's adorable. Thanks. Give me the weed. [quietly] I'm gonna give you the weed. There it is. In any case, we're gonna... No. Shit. Here, Olive. Help me, please. Sorry, darling. I dropped it on you. I'm a piece of shit. Sorry, sweetie. Are you okay? Fuck. Everything's okay, sweetie. [Joseph babbling] There. That's good. [Joseph] It's okay. Thanks. [beeping] [beeping] Well... I have a problem with you. Huh? What? No, don't touch the babies. -Marco. -No, no, no! Jaurès! Don't touch! No! Don't touch the babies. Are you crazy or what? -Jaurès, don't do that. -[Jaurès] Oh, God. You really think I'm here for a shitty little tray? -Jaurès, I'm begging you. -Shut up! You know... the merchandise your dad's been bringing doesn't have the right level of THC. Normally Pastraweed should be 19/33, and that's not the case. -I don't understand. That's impossible. -So you can tell your dad that he's gonna need to get his quality standards up very quickly. Otherwise... it's gonna be really bad for you guys. -[gasps] -No! [baby coughing] [Jaurès laughing] It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. -Don't worry. -[baby crying] -We're gonna fix this, Jaurès. -[baby crying] I promise you we will. I think that would be best for everyone. -Okay, get lost. -Don't worry. Let's go. Get the stroller. [hushes] -It's okay. -[Jaurès] Scram. -[Olivier] Damn, it's stuck. -Lift the brake. There. -Lift the brake. -[Olivier] It doesn't work. What an idiot. Come on. All right, there. Let's go. [baby crying] [Olivier] Fuck! ♪ Turkish delight ♪ ♪ My little Turkish delight ♪ ♪ Turkish delight ♪ ♪ Turkish delight, see you later... ♪ Ali, there's still one bag. [Ali] Okay. ♪ Turkish delight ♪ ♪ Turkish delight of my heart ♪ Turn that shit off, please. Oh... You're difficult. I think this album's cool. Honestly, Jo and Olive nailed it. That's the good Enrico. You know I love Joseph and Olivier with all my heart, but their thing's crap. Catch. -Even Gérard thinks it stinks. -[Ali laughing] [Aure] Here, Grandma. There's still this. I'll leave you to it. I have a date. I'm gonna take a quick shower. Okay? Who's the new girl? Well, really nice, really pretty, early 40s, a district attorney. Really very cool. What do you mean, a district attorney? Are you serious? No, I'm not serious, Ali. After the shit you gave me to dump that police officer, -I get it. -Well... She's a math teacher. There. Okay? Is everyone with that? If she doesn't stick her nose in our accounts. -[Ali laughing] -[Aure sighs] [hip-hop music playing] ♪ Family ♪ ♪ Business ♪ Hello, everyone. [all] Hello. [sponsor] Before we begin today, I'd like us to take a moment -to congratulate Gérard... -[door slams in distance] ...who I've been supporting since he started rehabilitation. Actually, I'm happy to announce that it's been 90 days. Ninety days that you've been sober and haven't touched cannabis. And I think you deserve a big round of applause. [sponsor] Thank you. Say a few words, Gérard. Uh... No, I don't really know what to say. Go on. It'll do you good. Um... [chuckles] You know, I... I lost my wife almost two years ago. [Gérard inhales deeply] Um... Before... she was my drug. And... when she died, uh... [sighs] I was... inconsolable. Yes. And I fell into that shit. But... in the end... it was my family who helped me out of it. First, my own. My kids encouraged me to come here. They opened up to me, and I... [laughing] I didn't want to. -[chuckles] -[Gérard] And then you guys. My narco family. You help me get through this, so... [clears throat] ...thanks. Thanks. -[all applauding] -Bravo, Gérard. [indistinct chatter] Congrats on your medal. -Thanks a lot. -No, thank you for your speech. It was so sincere. It got to me. [breathes deeply] My... -My sin is tranquilizers. -Ah. But I'm sure all addictions look a little alike, don't they? Well, um... Well... I don't know. I'm not an expert. [she chuckles] How did you cope with withdrawal? Food? Meditation? No, because... that's not really my thing. Sex maybe? [stammering] No. It was willpower. Hmm. And like I said earlier, I have good supporters. You're very lucky. [indistinct chatter in the background] Diapers. Saline. Come on, let's get out of here. Vamos, kids. Ah! Mom's here. How are you? Okay. And you? All good? [sighs] No, no, no. Honestly, perfect. We had a great day. We were gonna go. -You don't need the inhaler for Alia? -[Joseph] No. I was careful to keep dust out of the stroller. In fact, she was so cute. -What's that smell? -[Joseph] What smell? An odor? No, that was Ibra. He just had a blowout. -Like street art. -[Aïda] It doesn't smell like poop. [Joseph] What do you mean? It smells like shit. It's gotta be shit. Don't bother. It's shit. -It smells like weed. -[Joseph] What? -What the fuck did you do? -Are you kidding? It smells like weed? Oh, shit. No. Okay. No, that's Olive. Olive came by earlier and he must've smoked a little weed in his shitty car and picked up the little one... -Why did he come here? -Hold on. -You're getting carried away. -I said I didn't want your family here. You did, okay, but he was gone like the wind. He brought me something and left right away. I swear. Really. [panting] What's wrong? Oh, no. -Are you serious? -Listen. For sure, I won't hang out with Olive anymore. Okay? -I'll explain everything. -I'm gonna explain. If you sell drugs, you won't see your kids. I can't stop selling drugs, okay? I'm trapped. -I'm trapped by dangerous people. -Dangerous people? With my kids? No, when I say "dangerous," I'm exaggerating. -They're not really dangerous. -Shut up. -I can't stand you anymore. -Aïda! Stop. Calm down now, okay? I can't not see my kids. I was dumb to let you see them. -Fuck, how dumb! -Please! -Get out. I never want to see you again. -Aïda. I swear I'll call the cops. -Get out of here. -Fuck. [babies crying] [funky music playing] [doorbell buzzes] [doorbell buzzes] Can someone get that? I'm not done. [Ali] I'm hanging this thing up. I can't get it. [Aure] Dad, can you get it? No, I can't. I think I ate something bad. [groaning] -[doorbell buzzes] -[Ali] Clem, get the door! [Ali] Hey, Jo. So, where are the Bubelehs? They're not coming, Grandma. -[Ludmila] Oh? -Aïda doesn't want that. What? No. Seriously? She can't do that. We haven't seen them in months. -Why did she do that to us? -[Gérard] You're not serious? The little ones have to see their grandpa. Why didn't you insist? Of course I insisted, but she wouldn't budge. Fuck. What a waste on my end. A thousand euros each. [Gérard tuts] -When are we gonna see the Bubelehs? -[Joseph] I don't know, Grandma. She doesn't even want me to see them. No, she says that now, but she'll calm down. No, bro, she won't calm down. It's not the same. She completely turned on the business and Jaurès... Huh? Jaurès? [Gérard] Hold on. What does Jaurès have to do with this? I don't understand. Jaurès took one of the kids and she threatened her. There. [tuts] What? What do you mean, took a kid? Jo? She took one of the kids. She... How should I say this? Tell them! He took the triplets on a delivery. -[Aure] Excuse me? -[Gérard] Hold on. You mean... you took my grandkids to do a deal with Jaurès? Yeah. You're completely nuts. Why are you surprised that Aïda lost it? Are you crazy? No, hold on. Excuse me. Sorry. Calm down. Yes, of course we went to see Jaurès. She took one of the kids. That's true. -But it was to send a message to Jo. -No, don't downplay it, please. I'm not downplaying anything. Sorry, she was upset. She wanted to send you a message through the kid. It's gangster code. [Joseph] Gangster code? She took the baby and almost threw him on the ground. No, she picked up the little one to threaten you. Even if she was threatening me-- -Hey! Okay. -Hold on. Why was she upset? We have a problem with the level of THC. [Ludmila] There you go. I've been telling you for weeks we'd have a problem. I'm not a magician. I can't grow kilos per square meter. The barn is too cramped. We need more space. That's true. [Joseph] Or we go see Jaurès and tell her we're gonna scale back. Are you a complete idiot? What are you talking about? What about my boat? -Dad. -I don't know. Who gives a shit? My kids are threatened, you're talking about your boat. Well... -Dad, no. -[Gérard] It's for my Béné. -She's gonna kill my kids! -[blows raspberry] -That's it. -You're totally paranoid. Stop, please. You're not thinking straight, bro. I don't give a shit if you believe me or not. We're gonna find a radical solution. My kids getting threatened again is out of the question. Is that clear? Okay, Jo. We get it. We understand what you said. We're gonna find a solution and fix the problem. I promise. Thanks. That's exactly what I wanted to hear. -[Gérard] Oh, my God. So paranoid. -Stop, Dad. [indistinct mumbling] -[Aure] You're pushing buttons. -[Gérard mumbles] [dogs barking] [dogs barking] [sighs happily] Honey, this outfit is a disaster. Can't we hunt in camo like everyone else? No, we're not like everyone else. I'm talking about real hunting, not redneck hunting. You should be happy. This place is very exclusive. -Woo! -[woman] How are you? -How are you? -[woman] Hello. -Okay. -Hi. I don't know what's wrong with my gun. It doesn't fire straight. It's because you're breathing too hard. When you aim, you need to be like this, hold your breath, and... Is that your dad? -[Clémentine] Huh? -[Olivier] Your dad. -[Clémentine] Yeah. -He's gonna shoot me. -Why would he do that? -I fucked up his political career! Oh, yeah, that's right. Forget it. Ignore him. Because who's the man of my life now? -Cut it out. -Coot-coot, coot-coot-coot! Let's take a picture. -Yeah, a picture. -Please! No posting on Instagram. -I don't want anyone seeing me like this. -Who? Joseph, Aure, Gérard. Fuck, you're annoying! Always worried about what the Hazans think of you. "I don't want Joseph to see me like this." I'm gonna suckerpunch the Hazans. Sure. Always shitting on everyone. I said suckerpunch, not shit. Don't put words in my mouth. [gunshot] -[Clémentine] Moron. -Fuck. -Unbelievable. -[gunshot] Pain in the ass. -[deep inhale] -[Aure] You're smoking a joint? [exhales] It's nothing. I confiscated it from some guy. Not bad. Careful. That can fuck you up. Stop pretending like you never smoke. I already saw you out of it with your brother. Hmm. -Here. -I was high last time, but I'm serious. About? With all the money I'm making, we could start a business together. [exhales] Honestly, the police scare me. [scoffs] Whatever. But don't you want to switch jobs? Open a bar, a restaurant? No, I don't want to at all. You're funny. I'm not invited to your family reunions and you want to start a business? Why haven't you ever invited me? [inhales deeply] Because my family is a little complicated. What? I have to tell you something. Actually... they're not really okay that I'm with a woman. So you told them you're seeing a guy? No. Not at all. Of course not. They know we're together. No problem. But I don't want to bring you home and make everyone uncomfortable. There's no reason for them to be uncomfortable. Yes, there is. They all crack jokes non-stop. As a cop, I've heard a lot of homophobic bullshit. No, but I think this is another level. It's really hardcore. Okay, as you wish. But... if we start a business together, things could change. Come on. Give that back. You're rambling. You smoked too much. [inhales deeply, exhales] [Aure chuckles] [Youssef] Explosive grenades, son of a bitch. What did he say? He said, "Man, I want grenade-shaped cakes." Not pétanque balls, motherfucker. Wallah, this is shit, José. Sorry. This is shit. You drive me crazy. Sorry, we're closed, sir. My brother! What are you doing here? Shall I come back? You're dealing with something? No. He annoys me. I told him to make explosive grenades. -He made pétanque target balls. -That's not good. Give me a kiss. Quick. What's up, bro? I'm not great. There. -How can I say this? It's your sister. -What? Is she okay? -She won't let me see the kids. -Yeah. I know, bro. But you also fucked up. -I fucked up. -You did. She told me. -The bag in Ibra's diaper. -No, that's-- Are you losing it? You're doing shit like that? -I screwed up. There's no excuse. -Yeah. I thought maybe if you called her, you could change her mind. -You're the only person she talks to. -Change her mind? She's never changed her mind. You know her. She's crazy inflexible, bro. You know what I mean? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Unless... -Unless what? Unless you get on the right track. That's it. -Yeah. -Yeah. For example, my sister wasn't talking to me either before. Why? Because I was on the wrong track. But look today, bro. Hamdullah. I found this little gold mine. It's wonderful. You know what I do? I take flour and sugar and mix it all together. I sell that for 30 times more than it cost. Sometimes I think I'm still a thug. [laughing] I swear. People come in and buy things. "Hello, ma'am." One time, this lady said to me, "The handcuffs--" That's awesome, bro. It's just that... If you could tell her I'm stuck. We can't get out of the business. -Why not? -Because... we're prisoners. Who is "we"? -Us. The family. -I don't give a shit about your family. Wallah, I'm talking about you. You think your Mafia chick gives a shit about you? -Still... -No, you're worthless. I'm telling you. It's just about weed for her. That's the sinews of war. -Yeah, you're right. -Yeah, buddy. If she has her weed, she'll be fine. [sighs] So let your family handle the business and you step away quietly. I can't. It's complicated. -It's complicated? -Yeah. No, it's not. Do you want to see your kids again? Quit the business. Okay? Mm-hmm. Stop breaking my balls because I'm starting to lose it. -Are you crazy? -No, I'm not crazy! Help! [Joseph] You idiot. Chocolate. -[Youssef laughing] -[Joseph mumbles] -Taste it. -Wait... [muffled groan] There you go. [laughing] Did you see the face he made? [laughing] [Joseph] I've really thought about it. It's best if you go on without me. Because I... I think it's best if I quit the business. [inhales deeply] There. That's good. It's clear and simple. [inhales deeply, sighs] [melancholic music playing] [owl hooting] -Hey. -You okay, Jo? Yeah. What's this meeting with the tractors about? What is this? We have an announcement. Um... I also have something to tell you. Wait, me first. -Okay. -[Gérard] I think we found the solution... to solve your problems. -Really? -Yeah. [Gérard] We can't fuck around with the quality we deliver to Jaurès. That's dangerous... for us and the kids. You're right. So... We thought we'd grow in a new spot. [whirring] [cows mooing] [Olivier] What is this shit? What do we do with all these cows? The previous owner is gonna come and take the livestock in a month. We can start moving in. Not only will we be able to grow good Pastraweed here, but we'll be able to produce, I don't know... -four or five times more. -At least. Hold on. Are you insane? Four or five times more product means four or five times the risk. -You're totally crazy. -You're the one who doesn't understand. If we don't have quality issues, we don't have issues with Jaurès. -So the kids aren't in danger. -[Joseph] Okay. But Aïda doesn't give a shit about that. Jo, between us, your relationship has been a roller coaster. It'll work itself out. You just have to wait it out. Things will calm down. Yeah, Bubeleh. Don't worry. And Jaurès? Have you thought about Jaurès? Who told you she wants to buy five times more bud? Of course she'll want to. From the start, she's pressured us to grow more in the barn. Obviously this is good news for her. And if there's a surplus, I know an antique dealer that I've sold a couple kilos to. He trusts me. Wait, what did you do? An antique dealer. What? Do you realize what will happen if Jaurès finds out about that? We have an exclusivity agreement with her. -[Aure] Yeah, Jo-- -If she finds out, she'll kill us all. Don't get carried away. It's okay. Jaurès doesn't know everything. -She's not God. -You've all gone crazy. That's it. It's over. I've lost you all. We're not growing organic soybeans! You talk like this is legal. Like we don't have Jaurès on our ass. [Gérard] Hold on. Spare us the lecture. Let me remind you that you got us into this. So you're gonna call Jaurès. Okay? Set up a meeting with her and tell her we're ready to produce more. That's all. -No, I won't do it. -[Gérard] Son... You're the one who talks to Jaurès. It's always been like that. The majority wants to expand, so you'll follow suit. That's all. You all agree with that? -Yeah. -Well, yeah. Yeah. Okay. [tuts] The majority has spoken. I respect that. Okay. [indistinct chatter] It'll be fine, bro. [indistinct chatter] [Joseph] They no longer realize what we're doing is dangerous. I'm telling you... this is gonna end badly. I can't abandon them. [inhales deeply, sighs] I can't, but I need to see my kids. Honestly, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do, Mom. So, what brings you here? You said it was urgent. I hope it's exciting news. Yeah. It's great news. It's totally... exciting, uh... You're gonna like it. It's the beginning of a new era, um... in which I think we'll all be-- Spit it out. I don't have all day, Joseph. So, my family... has really thought about it and... and... we're stopping everything. What? We're stopping everything.
