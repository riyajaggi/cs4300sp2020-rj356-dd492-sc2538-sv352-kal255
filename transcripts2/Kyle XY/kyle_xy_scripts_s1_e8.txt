 Kyle XY (2006â€“2009): Season 1, Episode 8 - Memory Serves - full transcript 
 Gentle Kyle eagerly volunteers for a hypnosis session with therapist Dr. Jacob Cassidy, recommended by ma Trager, which unlocks his memory of Foss murdering professor William Kern in the woods, but the rest of his memory is blank except for some gibberish, which clever Josh realizes to be at high speed and then proves to be coordinates nearby; according to Jacob Kyle has paranoiac delusions, according to ma 'just' defensive severe amnesia. Hearing Declan is invited by an impressed basketball scout to Seattle's UW college, where Kern worked, Lori takes Kyle there and falls for student Wes. Kyle meets Kern's former brain stimulation research assistant, to her astonishment aces all Kern's test perfect, better then anyone before, and finds a 1985 picture of students including one resembling himself- it's Adam Baylin, missing for 20 years, then Kern's prodigy research collaborator, who drew the symbol and noted the coordinates in Kyle's subconscience. When Kyle goes to the woods location, which is blocked on Internet, Tom Foss stops him breaking in, and convinces him to stop digging in his past or the Trager family will suffer tragedy- alas the fence security cameras recorded his face...

 Previously on Kyle XY: - This from your dream? - I think it's a memory. - Hi. - I know you. You probably recognize me from patrolling the neighborhood. We got a problem. He's starting to remember. You've been a really good friend to me lately. And if you need someone to be that for you... I'm here. Do you think you've seen it before? No. If anyone could get a Ouija board to work, it's him.

 Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven. What does it mean? - What's wrong? - Police have identified the remains found last month as William Kern. That's him. A professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington. Maybe Kern was his teacher and if Kyle witnessed his murder... You're drawing conclusions before there's evidence. Kyle drew that picture before he knew Kern was missing. You can't tell me that's a coincidence. Kyle, hypnosis relaxes you. It allows you to focus very deeply. Dr. Cassidy has helped some of my

 patients make sense of their dreams. And by tapping into your subconscious, hypnosis can unlock memories you've lost or suppressed. What are we waiting for? Kyle, you're walking down the steps of a long staircase. And with each step, you find yourself relaxing more and more, letting every muscle relax. The staircase winds around until you come upon a door. Now gently turn the knob and ease the door open. Step inside. Kyle, where are you now? In a car. - It's raining. - Whose car is it? - I don't know. - Are you alone? A man. Professor Kern. He's looking in. - He's hurting him! - Who, Kyle? Who hurt Professor Kern? Foss! Jacob... I want you to leave that place now. Tell me what happened before. Before? Before you were in the car in the rain. Tell me what you remember. Go deeper now, Kyle. You're at another door. Open it and look inside at your past. There are images and sounds. Describe them to me. Kyle, what do you remember? - What is that? - I don't know. Jacob, take him out of this. Kyle, go back to the door and up the stairs. When I snap my fingers, you'll be safe in this room. - Bring him out, now. - One, two, three. I've never come across anyone like him. Beyond the images Kyle described from that night, he couldn't retrieve even one memory. Well, he's blocked. I told you, his amnesia is severe. Nicole, I think you need to consider another diagnosis. Kyle shows clear signs of delusions and paranoia. No. He's not schizophrenic. I've been treating Kyle for months. He's sensitive to others. He communicates, participates. No. And his fixation on Professor Kern? Police determined there's no connection. But I still believe there is one. We just haven't found it yet. And his fears about your security guard, Tom Foss? That's not paranoia? I think Tom Foss, as an authority figure, represents someone disturbing from Kyle's past. And that gibberish, you've never heard that before? No. No, but it could be a product of post-traumatic stress disorder. I mean, Kyle let out a string of nonsense syllables, like a cathartic release. Well, that's as good a guess as any. In the trance, I approached a door to my past, but the door was locked. I longed for the key, for a moment of clear understanding. But with every detour and dead end, it grew harder to stay optimistic. Two years till we graduate, my dad's already on me about applying to college. He's got his checkbook out, to buy me into the school of my choice. I think my parents started saving the second I left the womb. Kyle, what's up? So how'd it go today? I guess I shouldn't expect so much. I told you. Those hypnotists are bogus. Josh, that door is there for a reason. It's open. So did he make you cluck like a chicken? Get out! One thing I will not miss when I go to college. - You're going to college? - Eventually. Declan is already being recruited. Couple of scouts saw me play, from Whitman and U-Dub. - U-Dub? - University of Washington. The assistant coach keeps calling, so I thought I'd drive over tomorrow. Take me with you. I thought you were done playing basketball. That's where Professor Kern taught. The guy whose skeleton they found in the woods. If you want to come, Kyle, I'm fine with it. Kyle, you can't drive to U-Dub with Declan. My parents won't let you. You haven't established yourself as a trustworthy person. - That really hurts. - But I have to go. If I knew Professor Kern, someone there might know who I am. If my mom hears you wanna go... She wants me to figure things out. That doesn't include snooping around about some dead professor. You should've seen Kyle's reaction. The anxiety, when he talked about Tom Foss, as if he was really re-living the experience. And what, even under hypnosis, there's still no clue why Kyle had those flashes about him? No. And they're so vivid. I know Foss is just a replacement for someone, but still, it makes Kyle anxious to have him around. You're not gonna have to worry about that. I called Palisade Security today. You got him fired? Not quite. They agreed to take him off our detail. Well, I guess a transfer to Alaska was out of the question, but still it's a relief. Thank you. Oh, please. Not near my food. Hey. Hey. Kyle, sorry it didn't work out this morning. It was worth a try. Well, I'm glad you're not discouraged. I think Kyle needs a break from all this stuff. Declan's checking Whitman tomorrow. I thought I'd go, and Kyle's welcome to come. I thought Declan was going... Invite you himself? He meant to, so I'm asking you for him. Why are you being so nice to him? Yes, why are you? You make it sound like I'm this horrible person. Forget it. I don't have to take him. But I want to go. I'd like to see the school. Give him one day and he'll come back with a diploma. Well, what do you think? Bring me back a Whitman T-shirt. You wanted to go to U-Dub, didn't you? I don't like making up stories for them. Well, that's why I did it. You can thank me later. Hey, you ready to roll? Once and for all, you can find out if those dreams that you're having are real. Let's go. Welcome to U-Dub. Does anything look familiar? - No. - Not yet. Mrs. Trager, hi. Hello. I'm sorry to bother you, but I just came by to make sure that everything's OK. Everything's fine. Well, I guess I mean... Well, I know that you folks requested to have my detail switched and I just wanted to make sure that I hadn't done anything to upset you. We just felt that it wasn't a good match here. I'm sorry to hear that. Because I have to say that... I admire you, Mrs. Trager. I do. The way that you balance your career with your family and a foster child on top of that. I mean, it's a lot to handle. I really respect that. Even though I'm not on your watch anymore, I just want you to know that you can call on me if you ever need anything. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Goodbye. Check it out. We're in college, Trager. Then why do I feel like I have "high school" written all over me? - Kyle, where are you going? - To the science building. Hang on, where's the gym? Take that path, left at the commons, then straight for an eighth of a mile. You already memorized the campus? You're like a walking navi-system. So let's hook up in a couple of hours. By the student union? Sure. Think you can find it? This is it. Can I help you? Hi. I'm Lori Trager. This is Kyle. Hello. We were told this is Professor Kern's office? It was. Well, we think Kyle might have known the professor. - May have? - I'm not sure if I did. Kyle has amnesia. Seriously. And one of the few people he seems to remember is Professor Kern. I know this sounds out-there, but we were hoping being here might help Kyle remember. Do you know me? I'm sorry, no. I'm Anna Manfredi. I'm... I was Professor Kern's research assistant. Can I ask, what exactly was he researching? Essentially, he was interested in maximizing brainpower. Professor Kern developed theories covering areas of creative thinking, problem-solving, memory, logical thought and mental agility. - I've done some reading. - The thing is, Kyle is smart. Like Einstein-smart. He had an MRl and it showed a high level of brain activity. We were thinking maybe Kyle worked with the professor, which could explain... I did all of William's... Professor Kern's testing. I would've known if Kyle were involved. But I had to be. There has to be a connection. It's the only thing that makes sense. I'm sorry. Test me now. I'll take all of his tests and you'll see. All right, thanks. I appreciate it. Oh, this can't be good. Well, actually, that was good news. That was Detective Breen. I asked him to run a background check on Foss and it came up clean. I should never have told you. Nicole, I had him taken off our watch, then he shows up at the door to question you about it? But he wasn't hostile. I mean, it was more like concern. He can keep his concern. I don't want him around. He makes me uncomfortable. But he's never actually done anything wrong. Kyle's having nightmares about him, and he's got good instincts, so if Foss spooks him, that's reason enough for me. Heads-up! - Sweet catch. - Thanks. Your throw could use some work. I skipped Intro to Frisbee. That's too bad. I happen to teach that class. - I'm Wes, by the way. - Lori. - You go here? - Just visiting. What do you think so far? - Hey. - Hey. Declan, this is Wes. - What's up? - How's it going? Well, I should get back to the game. Give it up. - So how'd it go with Kyle? - Let's go find out. This is taking forever. He's... extraordinary. Kyle's results are so far beyond the normal range. I showed him 100 images in 60 seconds. He was able to remember all 100 of them. Not bad for a guy with no memory. Declan. Don't you think it's possible he worked with Professor Kern? I suppose, but William would have shared these results. His best test case, even with repeated practice, could only identify 37 images. What is he looking at? They're pictures and awards of students and faculty. Kyle? What is it? It's you. No, impossible. Check the date. 1985? So how's Whitman? They kick you out yet? Josh, just put Mom or Dad on. You don't really think you can get in there, do you? Josh. Your grades are lame. You've got no after-school activities and there's really nothing special about you. - Josh! - What's the matter with you? Hello? Hey, Dad, we're having a cool time. Can we crash here and come home tomorrow? You want to spend the night? I don't think so. They have great activities for prospective freshmen. Involving beer kegs and bongs? No. God, Dad. I thought you'd be happy. I can't apply for a year, and I'm psyched about going to college. Well, where are you going to sleep? They have accommodations for us. Come on, Kyle's here. It's guaranteed G-rated. We're all really into it. Just be careful and keep your cell phone on. I will. And thank you. All right. If we told them the truth, they'd flip out and make us come home. There's no way we can leave here now. We just saw a picture of you in 1985. That wasn't me. Then it's your long-lost twin. I'm not in my 40s. Look, Anna snagged us a room, my parents are cool. Do you want to find out who that man is or not? Seeing that picture, I felt I was getting close to the truth... and it scared me. Absolutely. What is that? Sorry, it's one of my patients. Was it Kyle? That must be his alien voice. Sort of a mix between human and dolphin. Out. It's like he's talking at the wrong speed. Josh. seven, N. One, two, two, one, eight, W. Four, seven, two, seven, N. One, two, two, one, eight, W. Four, seven, two, seven, N. One, two, two, one, eight, W. Four, seven, two, seven, N. One, two, two... How weird was that, seeing that picture? Think about it, you and that guy could be related. I haven't stopped thinking about it. If Josh were here, he'd have some sort of time-traveler theory, with you jumping through portals in space. Which you didn't. Did you? Sorry. There's this whole other world going on. There really is life after high school. I got coaches across the country begging me to play for them. They don't have what U-Dub has. - What's that? - Me. I take it back. It is high school all over again. - Hey, Lori. - Hey. You don't recognize me without my Frisbee. No, I do. Wes, right? How long will this trip of yours last? Just till tomorrow. We should make the most of it. Oh, I... Kyle, do you want to look around? You go. I'll see you later. You sure? So do you want to see my room? Actually, I'm here with someone. Then why am I talking to you? eight, one, two, two, seven. Seven, eight... OK, that's the number Kyle pointed out on the Ouija board. But the rest? Four, seven, two, seven, N. One, two, two, one, eight, W... The same pattern over and over again. Some sort of code. Well, I can't make any sense of it. Par for the course with Kyle. Play it back again. I want to take it down. Four, seven, two, seven, N. One, two, two, one, eight, W. Four, seven, two, seven, N. One, two, two... Kyle, I've been looking for you. Are you OK? Just a lot to take in. New places are hard for me too. The problem is, I don't know if it is a new place or somewhere I've been before. I can't imagine. I'm sure when the time is right everything will become clear to you. William would have been so excited to meet you. You miss him. We were... good friends. I'm sorry about what happened. There is such brutality in this world. Still, you are an inspiration. You somehow achieved William's dream. To possess a mind as fast as a computer. How does it make you feel? Different. But just think of all that you can accomplish. By doing math problems? Solving equations and puzzles? - That's not important. - What is? Knowing who I am. So, what do you want to study? I haven't really thought about it. Well, what interests you? - I don't know. Art. - Yeah, I can see that. - Yeah? - Absolutely. I hate museums. I don't get art at all. I just said it to have something to say. I bet that you have a lot to say, Lori. You just haven't found the right person to listen. I know that sounded like a line... Totally. Well, I meant it, though. Is it true? - Hey, you're still up. - Hard to sleep. Miss your tub? - She's still out? - I thought she was with you. No, she was talking to that guy. If you like Lori, why don't you tell her? She knows that I like her. Take your own advice. I haven't seen you pour your heart out to Amanda. I picked up on it. But no worries, I don't think she and Charlie have. Must kill you to see them together. I want her to be happy. I would be in there so fast. But Charlie's your friend. If you want someone, you gotta give it a shot. If people are meant to be together, they stay together. Oh, Kyle. I know it's early, but I couldn't wait. - What happened? - I found out his name. The guy in the photo. It's Adam Baylin. - Adam Baylin. - Does it ring a bell? - No. - Excuse me. Sorry. Just need to grab a towel. Don't be discouraged. There's someone I want you to meet who might help. She's a secretary in my department. Oh, those eyes. Who could ever forget those eyes? He really looks like him? - Very much so. - What was he like? Adam Baylin was brilliant. One of the finest graduate students we ever had. And believe me, I've been here forever, so I know. Lily, tell them who he worked with. Professor Kern. William Kern was like a mentor to him. They were involved in several projects together. But it's not just Adam's academic achievements I remember. It's the way he took the time to ask me about my life. He was that way with everyone. His curiosity, his sensitivity. That's what I miss. So to see you here... Do you have an address or a phone number? There are so many things I'd like to ask him. Oh, sweetheart, didn't you know? You can't ask him anything. Adam Baylin has been missing for 20 years. I can't believe they kept all his research. He must have been exceptional. I don't think anyone's been through these boxes in 20 years. Sounds about right. He was so involved in his work then doesn't show up at school one day. Apparently, he disappeared without a trace. Anything I can find out about Adam Baylin is in these boxes. Take your time. Hey, I've been waiting for you. Great, you can grab the rest from the car. No, listen, those letters and numbers? I figured it out. They're coordinates. Latitude and longitude. What do you mean? Like a location? Near Seattle. Forty-seven degrees, 27 minutes north. Hundred and twenty-two degrees, 18 minutes west. I looked up the spot online, on View-It Earth. But here's the thing: That location is blocked. Blocked? Why? It's a top-secret government facility. - Josh! - Like Area 51, where they hide all the aliens. Kyle talked about it under hypnosis. How much more proof do you need? Josh, you shouldn't be listening. If Kyle's the patient, why talk to Dad about him? - I'm his foster father. - And I'm his foster brother. If there's something going on with him, especially something this cool and bizarre, I think I got a right to know about it. Reading Adam Baylin's thoughts, I felt a connection beyond our physical resemblance. I understood his research. It seemed that his mind worked like my own. We had to be related. We had to be. OK, what's with the attitude? It's like working with a hostile mute. I'm just concentrating. Yeah, I'm sure you're really fascinated by all these equations and formulas. Want to tell me what's going on? Look, I know you're psyched, pretending you're in college and all, but come on. You sleep with Frisbee Boy after one night? OK, first off, it's none of your business who I sleep with, and second, it's still none of your business, but I did not have sex with Wes. - Right. - God, Declan. We stayed up late talking then I fell asleep in his room. Such a double standard. If I gave you a hard time, you'd tell me to piss off. - I wouldn't say "piss off." - You know what I mean. We're friends, friends don't guilt each other about who they hang out with. You're right. It's all good. So, what did you two talk about? It was less that he talked and more that he listened. Kyle, I'm sorry, I don't think there's anything here. Yes, there is. Adam Baylin drew it 20 years ago. Hilary called. She was surprised you were going to Whitman. Declan had plans to go to the University of Washington. Dad... - What's going on? - OK, look. We came up here to help Kyle. I don't care. - You don't lie to us. - I'm sorry. We found out some things, like this grad student who looks like Kyle. He's been missing since the '80s. What are you talking about? The guy drew the symbol Kyle kept drawing, with this code next to it. Kyle figured out it's latitude and longitude, like an address. What are the coordinates? Forty-seven, 27 north, 122, 18 west. It's a spot in the woods by here. How did you know that? You know Kyle. He's got a map of the universe in his head. - We're gonna go check it out. - No, you are not. You'll get back in that car and drive home immediately. We can't leave now. You will leave now. Do you hear me? I mean it. OK, calm down, we're going. OK. Goodbye. Great. They've been playing detective. Why ask about the coordinates? Kyle figured out it's in the woods near school. The spot that was blocked? They were planning to go, but I told them to come home. They better be. Hilary has such a big mouth. Oh, man. I forgot I'd mentioned it to her. Sorry, Kyle. We have to go home. We can't. My dad was pissed. We'll come back another time. Fine. Bathroom break, and then we're leaving. - Wait, where are you going? - I have to get there. You don't have a car. I'll find someone to drive me. You can't do that. I can't turn back now. I'm too close. OK, we'll convince Lori to go. No, I don't want her to come. It might be dangerous out there. Because that man Adam Baylin's been missing? Yeah. We'll call, tell her what we're doing, then come back and pick her up. - It's right here. - Here? It's Lori again. OK, OK, stop yelling. I cannot believe you did this to me. Do you know how much trouble I'm in? We're at the spot. I'll call you later. Don't hang up on me. Don't...! Sure this is it? Yes. All we need is a Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion. Never mind. - Stay here. - No way. - I'm going alone. - Like hell. Declan. Thanks for driving me, but I have to do this on my own. I'll be fine. Stop! - What do you want? - Shut up. - Why are you following me? - Shut up and listen to me. I'm not gonna hurt you. If I wanted you dead, you'd be dead already. Like you killed Professor Kern? He's not who you thought. Trust me. Trust you? Everything I did was to protect you. No. - To keep you safe. - Safe from what? You gotta trust me. You gotta stop asking questions. Forget about the past. Get on with your life. Because if you don't, you're gonna put yourself and you're going to put Nicole, Stephen, Lori and Josh, that whole family, in danger. What are you talking about? They'll kill you, Kyle. - They'll kill all of you. - Kyle! - Now get out of here. - Kyle! And remember what I told you. Go! And don't ever come back. Go! Man, what is he doing? Kyle! Let's go. What happened? What did you see? - Nothing. - Kyle, you saw something. There was nothing there. I'm sorry I lied to you. I thought it was important for Kyle. I told you to come straight home. That was my fault, Mr. Trager. Please don't be mad at Lori and Declan. They did it for me. Kyle, that student who resembles you, Lori said he's been missing for 20 years, and that he drew the logo. There's no point in pursuing it now. What difference does it make to my life now? If that's the case, why is that spot blocked on View-It Earth? No reason it should be. It's just a bunch of trees. Something happened out there in the woods. No. I know you're in trouble, Kyle. I'm gonna tell Lori's parents. No, you can't do that! Then talk to me. That man, Tom Foss, the security guard, he was out there in the woods. He warned me to stop asking questions about my past. Why? Something bad could happen to the Tragers. So we can't tell anyone or do anything. Just move on and forget all about it. Understand? Can I trust you? Yes. What, no goodbye? You're not mad anymore? I'm over it. - Thanks for taking me, Lori. - Told you you'd thank me. Later, bro. Later. If you dare say, "Later, Trager..." I wasn't going to say anything. All this time, I'd been trying to restore my memory. But I didn't realize that sometimes memories are better left forgotten. I wanted to know who I was. But maybe some mysteries are better left unsolved. From three hours ago. Seven, eight, one, two, two, seven. He's alive.
