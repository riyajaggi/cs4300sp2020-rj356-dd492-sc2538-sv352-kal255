 Previously on Kyle XY: So let me understand. The boy has no family that you know of, he doesn't communicate and was found wandering alone. But there is one more thing you should see. No belly button. I have a new patient, and where he's staying isn't safe, so I'm bringing him here for a little while. Some mental patient's going to live in our house? He's a very sweet, very special boy. - I don't want him touching my things. - If your mom says he's coming, he is. Juice me.

 Did he just learn to talk in one day? No. Lori, that's impossible. That was an hour-long test. - How long did it take, five minutes? - Yeah. And he got them all right! What is this kid, seriously? Somebody has to be missing this kid. So far no one's filed a report. I was hoping you wouldn't mind if Kyle stayed with us a while longer. They called it sleep. A strange state after dark during which they did nothing... ...thought nothing... ...but made odd noises and sometimes spoke. Run! How could they just lie there all night?

 There was so much to learn and explore. I didn't know where to begin. Every taste and texture made my senses explode. - It's 4:00 in the morning. - It seemed to matter, what this number was. - What were you thinking? - He didn't know better. Was he raised by wolves? No, apparently by Chinese people. OK, enough. It's late. Let's finish this up in the morning. Kyle, you must be exhausted. When did you wake up? I didn't wake up. Have you been having trouble sleeping? I don't sleep. You mean, not tonight? I mean, not ever. You've been with us for over a week. You're telling us you haven't slept, not even once? Never. - Hi, hon. - Hey. I only have an hour. Those numbers. They planned everything around them. - How about you? You have to go in? - No. I took time off to be with Kyle. The numbers represented time, which they never seemed to have enough of. So I'll tell you why Kyle hasn't slept for ten days. - He's an alien. - He's not an alien. I've never seen him sleep and his bed is next to mine. You fall asleep before he does. Save the imagination for summer school, which reminds me, no Xbox until you finish those assignments. - I'm gone. - No breakfast? No time. How could she not have any? It seemed to be all they talked about. Mom, there's a detective here to see you. Kyle, you said the last thing you remember is being in the woods. Now, how did you get there? I don't know. Do you remember why you weren't wearing clothes? I don't remember ever having any. OK, um, how old are you? We don't know. We're guessing around 16. Where did you live before here? Nowhere. I'm sorry. I just don't remember. It's OK, Kyle. You will. I wish I could report more progress, but no one's filed a missing person's report that fits Kyle's description. No one noticed he's gone? How could that be? He has to have come from somewhere. Someone has to be missing him. Maybe he left a bad situation at home. You think Kyle's a runaway? Or something terrible could have happened to him. I've seen it in my practice, patients with amnesia caused by some traumatic experience. I've seen people with amnesia too, but never to this degree. I've never seen anyone like Kyle before. It was madness at my house last night. Captain Clueless ate half our kitchen. Kyle? I wouldn't mind feasting on him. That boy's a hottie. There's Declan. Can't believe he hasn't called. Hilary, he can do what he wants. So can I. - Yo, Hills. - Hey there. Trager, I haven't seen you around. Been busy. No time for me anymore? I might be able to fit you into my schedule. As long as you ditch the skank. We saw you mauling that nympho at your party. She was mauling me. I couldn't shake her. Besides, you took off with that guy. - What guy? - The kung fu master. The dude who broke my window then messed with the cop. - You mean... - Kyle! The way he scooped her up and carried her off... Isn't he incredible? Let him chew on that for a little while. Hi. Nicole Trager. We're here to see Dr. Stone. Nicole, all you've written down here is "Kyle". His name is the only thing we know about him and even that we made up. No memory, no medical history? No, he's like a 16-year-old newborn. With a newborn we know the parents and have a genetic history. So where do we start? Let me see the films. They said the MRI machine was broken. It had to be. Nobody could produce that much brain activity. He does have an extraordinary aptitude for math. It's not possible. Even a genius IQ would not show half those results. I had no idea what he was looking for... Good. Kyle, open. Aah. ...or why he thought he'd find it in my mouth. Maybe it was in his. I'm not a dentist, but are these veneers? His teeth don't look worn at all. They look brand new. He didn't know what a toothbrush was until I showed him. Lay back, Kyle. You tell me. I've never seen anything like it. Clearly a genetic anomaly. - I knew something was missing... - Skin graft? - ... but I didn't know why it mattered. - What for? And no trace of a scar? Perhaps surgery to correct an umbilical hernia? Dr. Stone, I don't think they'd wipe out the whole navel. Some of his characteristics are unusual, but he's in excellent shape, physically. Obviously, his mental health is cause for concern. I'll be working to recover his memory, but now I'm more worried that he's not sleeping. Well, if I didn't know who I was, I'd have trouble sleeping too. But he must be sleeping, Nicole. He looks fine, not tired at all. But he says he hasn't slept in ten days. Not once, and I've never seen him asleep. Give him one of these. Guaranteed to give him a good night's sleep. And don't worry, Nicole. Normal people can't go long without sleeping. And you think Kyle is normal? No belly button aside, heart rate's good, blood pressure's fine. Just like any other kid his age. Oh, my. How did he do that? - Oh, my. - Did you see that? Great! I think I've got it. What if time is different on Kyle's home planet? Josh, this is Kyle's home planet. One earth day might be, like, an hour for him. So ten days... Is like ten hours. Yeah, I get it. - You're being ridiculous. - Think about it. He's this super brain with amnesia. He can't understand the simplest things, but does calculus like it's two plus two. He barely knows what you're saying sometimes, but somehow speaks Chinese. He never sleeps and I haven't gotten to the belly button thing yet. Mom, I'm telling you, Kyle is not human. Oh, Kyle. Of course you're human. See? Even he's not sure. Stop wasting time. Go do your homework. That's a waste of time. I didn't know time could be wasted. Kyle, I want you to try something. Sometimes people have trouble sleeping because they're concerned about something that's happened to them. - Am I? - I'm not sure. But this might help you recall some experiences. I want you to draw anything, anything at all. Anything you can remember about where you came from. About your home. Great. Even if it doesn't make any sense to you now. Kyle's still at it. He's been drawing for hours. Good. Wear him out. The way he draws... It's almost like he snaps a picture in his head and then reproduces it. It's the same sort of thing over and over. This must be the place near Victor Falls where he was first seen. His earliest memory. What do you think it means? I think something significant may have happened there, but he can't explain it yet. Chamomile always does the trick for me. It's very soothing. It's gonna help you sleep. - Tastes like horse pee. - Josh! - It does. - What does horse pee taste like? - How would I know? - You just said... It's just an expression. A rude one. Here, Kyle. Try the tea. It's hot, though. Be careful. No, not the tea bag. The water. You drink the tea. - Alien. - What are you doing? Eats tea bag. I'm keeping a list. What makes Kyle an alien. - It's good? - It's good. Now I'm the tea bag. Somehow I felt safe here. Secure. At peace. He loves it under there. 'Cause he's weightless, like in space. - Out. - I'm right. See? He's still under. Kyle. Relaxed? One of us is. So, what's up for tonight? Hitting the town with Mr. Kung Fu? Nope. Just hangin'. Maybe I'll swing by later. Maybe I'll be around. Hold on. Kyle, do you mind? Sorry. ...future today. Madacorp, on the web at M-A-D-A-C-O-R-P dot com. Likes white noise. Check. Dude, you'll never sleep with that on. Yo, hands off the stash! My Sour Patch Kids are sacred. I can't wait to fall asleep. Last night the entire Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue came to life. Just me and seven supermodels. I am so primed for the sequel. OK, Kyle. Well, you've had a bath, some warm tea. - Feeling tired? - No. I'm sure part of the problem is you're anxious. Remember, Detective Breen and the police are still searching. They're looking for answers. In the meantime, you've got to get some sleep and this will help. Will you take it? I took it. No. You have to... You have to swallow it. And then I'll sleep? - Good. - Perfect. Good night, boys. - Sleep well. - Sweet dreams. Oh, they will be. He looked so pleased, stretched out, doing nothing. But I still felt like the whole world was calling out to me, waiting to be explored. I learned it was wrong to touch things in the house while they were sleeping. So... I went outside. Wow. How did you do that? You're like the Dog Whisperer. What are you doing out there? - Can't sleep. - Me neither. By the time I get done with all my stuff I just can't pass out for eight hours. I need a little down time, you know? Down time. Yeah. To just sit here. Do nothing. Just look at the stars. They make you feel so small. I just lose myself when I look up there. I heard how you don't remember anything. That must be really hard. Scary. I should get some sleep. You should too, Kyle. I bet your family's searching for you right now. I mean, they have to be. You didn't just fall from the sky. - What are you doing? - Walking. - Why are you out of bed? - I wasn't sleeping. Stop skulking around. You'll give a person a heart attack. - Lori? - Oh, great. - What's going on? - I heard him down here. - I wanted to make sure he was OK. - With full makeup on? What? I haven't washed my face yet. - Upstairs. Now. - Dad, I... - I was just... - Move. Kyle. Did you get any sleep? No. All right. Come on, upstairs. Let's go back to bed. - What happened? - It's OK. Go back to sleep. - Where did you go? - Outside. You went outside, Kyle? - Yes. - What did you do? I looked at the stars. OK, now's not the time for stargazing, Kyle. Now's the time to get some sleep. I'll see you guys in the morning. You had to be out there, didn't you? Under the stars? So they could find you. Were they gonna beam you up? - Beam me? - Your peeps, dude. Your real family in the stars. - Coffee? - Black. In fact, just toss me the can. I'll chew on the grinds. You never fell back to sleep, either? - At least Kyle got some sleep. - You checked on him? His door was closed. I was afraid to make a sound. 'Morning. I need a cup of joe. You need a pick-me-up? Make chocolate milk. - Kyle still asleep? - Not in his bed. He isn't? - Kyle? - Check the bathtub. He loves it in there. I wonder if he wandered out again. - When did he wander out before? - Found him. Kyle? What are you doing? - Waiting. - For what? To go home. Tell me he's not an alien. I spoke to Dr. Stone and he can't understand why the pill didn't work. It didn't do anything. He's still rarin' to go. He said if this continues he wants to admit Kyle and sedate him. Well, he should. - No. - He has to sleep. No. I don't want Kyle knocked out in some hospital. But what we're doing isn't working. He needs to be where it's familiar, where he feels comfortable. Well, how comfortable can he be if he can't sleep here? So, what happened last night? - You never came out. - Sorry, I got nabbed. It feels like you're jerking me around. - Declan, my parents caught me... - You and who? That guy Kyle? Was he in there with you? Look, Kyle's one of my mother's head cases. He's just staying with us. Hilary was messing with you. - That right? - Yeah. - So come by tonight. - You gonna leave me hangin' again? No way. I'm so there. OK, then. Later, Trager. Later. - Where are we running? - No place. We're just running. Why are we running? Well, the plan is to exhaust you. We started at ten after, right? - Gotta go at least a half an hour. - Why? It's good exercise, gets rid of stress. Stress? Yeah, pressure. You know, tension. Running takes away what's worrying me. It's my time to escape. But you watch time when you run and time is just numbers that people made up. We need those numbers to keep order in the world. So you can never really escape time? You can never just be. Well, I think you can escape in your own head. Let's pick up the pace. Go faster. - Hey, how did it go? - I'm beat. He's ready for a marathon. It's incredible. That kid's a lightning bolt. Look at this. This line he drew. It has nothing to do with the rest of the picture. That's strange. Stephen, I'm gonna stay up and watch him tonight, make sure he doesn't wander out again. You gonna camp out by his door? Well, I just think he'd feel more secure with me nearby. All right. We'll go in shifts. - Me first. - I knew I loved you. No midnight Xbox for me tonight. And no nasty-nasty for you and Declan either. What are you talking about? They're posting guard to keep track of Kyle. Right out my door. Oh, no. Yeah. Welcome to Alcatraz. You're killing me. Can't you slip by them? - No. Come back later. - So you can bail on me again? Don't go high-maintenance on me. Maybe they'll fall asleep and I can sneak out. I'm not staying up for a "maybe. " Then we'll have to make it another time. - You're not happy. - No, Kyle, I'm thrilled. You don't sound thrilled. It's called sarcasm. Get used to it. You wanted to leave with him. No, I wanted to stay here, trapped in my room all night. - Sarcasm. - You're catching on. Why did you want to go? Because we have a good time. Can't you have a good time another time? I don't know. Maybe. It doesn't work that way with us. We don't make plans. Why? Kyle, you ask too many questions. Get out. Go to bed. Stephen. Hmm? Wha? Is he asleep? Go. You have a huge meeting tomorrow. I'll take over. OK. Thank you. Are you feeling tired at all? My body feels slower. My muscles ache a bit. Good. That's good. But my head can't stop thinking. You have to clear your head, Kyle. Do what I do. Count backwards from 100. You counted already? OK. Count backwards from 1,000. No, 100,000. And if that doesn't work, try 100 million. 12,680... 12,679... Still counting? - Sweetie. - What? What? - We overslept. - My meeting! Is it too late? Damn it, Nicole, I can't afford to make mistakes like this. We'll get over this hump. Kyle will acclimate. This was supposed to be temporary. You said he'd be here until somebody claimed him or you found him another place. - I'm trying to. - You spend all day caring for him. He wakes us up every night. It's like having a new baby. New babies keep you up. Yeah, but this one is huge, and he's not our kid! He doesn't belong here, Nicole. We can't just abandon him because it's not easy to have him around. We're the only thing he has right now. And I can't give up on him. Kyle. Thank you. Detective Breen has squad cars in the area still looking for him. He has been gone all day. Is that all they can do? Do they know Kyle's sort of different? They know all about him. Kyle's listed as a missing person. So our missing person's missing. It's not funny. It's gonna get dark soon. - Kyle could get hurt. - Since when do you care? I don't want anything bad to happen to him. It's my fault. I was horrible to him. That's why he ran away. No, sweetheart. Actually, I think he overheard me and your dad. - We may have upset him. - Well, I was nice to him. I was! Sort of. I've been all over the neighborhood. There's no sign of him. Let's check downtown where the cops found him. No, I think the city frightened him. I just don't think he would go there. Kyle doesn't know anywhere to go. Yes, he does. Nicole, this is a long shot. - It's worth trying. - Why would he come out here? Besides our house, this is the only home he knows. He's here to go home. ET, phone home. This stump looks like a landing pad for a shuttle, sent by his mother ship. - Oh, for Pete's sake. - We should have left him home. How did he even make it out here on his own? Dad, you're talking about someone with no belly button. Who knows what he can do. - Dork, he's not up there. - I'm looking for the craft. Come on. Knock it off. Kyle. Kyle! Kyle. It's OK. Gotcha. You're OK. We were so worried. What are you doing here? Why'd you come? I came so my family could find me. I think we just did. - Come on. - Come on. I understood then... we need patterns. Time to be awake, time to rest. Congratulations. You look exhausted. You feel it? Yes. But what if I don't sleep? Oh, tonight is your night, Kyle. You just have to find the right spot for yourself. Now, just relax. Get comfortable. Be right back. How's he doing? Well, he looks beat. But who knows? We may be in for another long night. Well, let's get him to bed. Kyle? Dad? I know. But that's where he's most comfortable. In the bathtub? - Who cares? At least he's asleep. - If people find out, I will die. I'm telling you, this guy's an alien. I'm calling Steven Spielberg. OK. Now that he's finally asleep I have a ton of stuff to catch up on. Hold on, hold on. You just stay here and be with me. I'm so glad Kyle can rest. Now he can start to remember. To finally sleep. A few hours of blissful escape before facing those questions once again... ...of who I am and where I'd come from.
