 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES That's how we'll straighten the main road to Brussels for once and forever. Speed is the future. How can I spend money I don't have?

 Sell that to your paupers. Low price, big volume. Opium for the people. Michel d'Embaux, like his father and all previous generations, is a knight. You're marrying into nobility. How could you stoop so low, father? Closing a deal with our title. I do not claim to have your brother's shooting skills, but many wild boar have been devoured thanks to me. Would you like to come? If you dare to hunt with a woman. I did something terrible. FOR EMIEL EMBO

 I had no choice. I came here to tell you that Emiel is dead. I'm sorry. Sir. Could you help us? WANTED, JAN DE LICHTE FOR DESERTION AND MURDER 2,000 FLORINS REWARD We could negotiate. Negotiate? Don't know what that is. Greet God for me. What did Jan do? For them to come so far to get him? We didn't ask, Shoe. Come on, let's go. You look so serious when you think, Benoît. It is serious, Mayor. 70,000 is way too little. Now's the time. For men who think. Me, for example. Look around. - Thank you. - Turn your gaze to the New World. To America. What's there? America is the land of the future. Do you know how big it is? Ten times bigger than Europe. Ten million people there and a hundred million here in Europe. You're well informed. Do you know how they work those huge fields? Bigger than we can imagine. Even in France. Who do you think works those fields? Immigrants? No. Pioneers? Indians? I don't know. Slaves, Benoît. Slaves do the work. For over a century they've been trading slaves. It's a great system. One in three Americans are African slaves. 33% of the total population. Those 33% do 100% of the work. How brilliant is that? We live in the century of the slave. As long as we are the slave drivers... there's nothing to fear. Do you want to buy slaves in Africa? No, I don't need to. We make our own, here. I don't follow, Mayor. My outlaws are my slaves, Benoît. The more you need to build the bigger road, the more I'll banish. They'll work for less than nothing. If they don't, the gallows await. Ever heard of the Simon Company? Yes, they hire the outlaws to do dirty work. Right. We'll take this small thing and scale it way up, Benoît. - What can you do? - I'm trying. But it doesn't seem to be working. We could get the gypsies. I won't have their hocus pocus here, you know that. Then we must go there. If it reaches his brain, he's done for. We'll take him, Tincke. Do as you please. But make sure he pulls through. My compliments. I had heard you were the greatest artist in the region, but seeing it with my own eyes... Lovely. Héloïse d'Embaux, daughter of our printer, Michel. She's delightful, a real lady. I painted her from memory, for her wedding present. Pity she's getting married. To a man of standing, I presume. An awful mistake, if you ask me. Nicolaï van Gelderhode, son of our entrepreneur, Benoît. New money, from whatever. As vulgar as the plague, real snobs. The parents worse than the son. Mr. Baru, money does not bring dignity. Nice wine, by the way. An angel pissing on your tongue. Chassagne-Montrachet, 1705. Let me come to the point, Mr. Baru. Our stagecoach goes to Ghent on Wednesday. I politely ask you if you would accompany it. This is why. My old mother's birthday present. It's of great sentimental value to her and myself, and I would like you to deliver it to her personally. I know it is an exceptional favour, but... No, it's a pleasure. This way, I can visit my brother in Ghent. I've heard good things about you in Ghent. I'm glad you were appointed bailiff. I am entirely at the service of the city. Let them pass. Asshole, going to lose your pants again? Shit stains and all. Come on then, motherfuckers. Come on. Well played, men. Tincke, drop it, pal. Pack your stuff. They're here. Now we wait. We'll stay with him. We can do no more here. You should stick to dice. I watched you. The three of them were playing against you. Right, what do you owe this time? It's over, friend. What did you say? A week's delay? I like you, Tincke. You have more class than the others here. Nice of you to say so. Five thousand in seven days at 100% is... I've never been good at sums. I thought so. Ten thousand sols, by midnight on Sunday. Sound reasonable? Yes. Get a wife, Tincke. It's safer and cheaper than gambling. Yes... If you want to make merry, you pay the price. See you next time. Stop. Stop. Not again. No. I'm busy. Stop. Excuse me. Stop it, Cross-Eyes. Help yourself, I'm busy. We're here with a proposition for Iron Simon, your boss. A proposition? Yes, something that will interest him. We have great plans and I think Mr. Simon... As I said, I'm busy. Come back later, or wait until I'm done. Come on, sweetie, come with daddy. We can't stay here. The mayor gave me clear orders. You must make your proposal in security. That hasn't yet happened. Gentlemen. Perhaps I can help you. You're stronger than I thought, Jan de Lichte. Who'd do such a thing? Buckriders? Sadists? Satanists? Someone has embroided the outlaw brand on here. A sort of diploma? Something to be proud of. A medal. Do you recognize this sign? No. An eagle in a circle on the sole of the foot. This boot belongs to an Austrian soldier. Or a former soldier. Maybe they took the boots from a corpse. Do you think they're so fearless they'd kill a soldier? If even the City Watch don't dare enter the woods, there'll be trouble. The outlaws are located between the cities. They're forming communities, clans. When they realize how strong they are, they'll turn on the city. Then a leader will arise and unite them. And who could blame them? I don't know how to thank you. A few hours ago, I was in another, strange place. You brought me back. I didn't do it on my own. Marieke helped me. Take care, Jan de Lichte. You may have beaten your fever, but your fate is still full of obstacles. I already figured that out. Virgin Mary, Mother of God, pray for us poor sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Enjoy. Cheval Blanc and ortolans. Perfect. Not much meat on them. Exquisite, then. A delicatesse. Michel, did I tell you about our new undertaking to make a new road to Ghent? Yes, I heard something about that. A noble goal. The ruts get deeper every year. The stagecoach loses valuable time on those roads. This is 1747, we don't live in the Middle Ages anymore. In England, they're trying out a new method. They mix tar with pebbles and get a very flat surface. You can reach speeds that defy imagination. So they say. Bon. A toast to the future. May everything go much faster. In the name of God. May I jump in? To a wonderful future and a rich and preferably masculine descendance. Good health. Cheers. A beautiful new dress, Héloïse. You look lovely. Thank you, sir. Nicolaï, please. Like last time. Of course. We're leaving. Don't shoot. Who are you? Urkens Senior, sir. This is my eldest. And that's my youngest. Please, sir. I ask you not to harm us. Please. Could you... perhaps help us, sir? I can no longer care for these children. Could you help us? Please, sir? Urkens, head south, through the woods, until you reach an open space. That's our camp. Go to the bar The Hunger and ask for Tarara. Say Jan de Lichte sent you. If anyone bothers you, show him that. Thank you. Promise me one thing: that you'll never bow to any man again. Go. You asked if I dared go hunting with a lady? Well, I would be honoured to accompany you on the wild boar hunt. With pleasure, sir. As you have not hunted since your brother left for war, I suggest we take it easy. Enjoy. Hey. Bravo. May I be excused? You must indeed excuse her. I fear the news of Emiel's death is still weighing heavily on her. My condolences, d'Embaux. But it must be a comfort that your son died a hero. One moment. I would be proud, it is an honour granted to few fathers. I'd like to drink to your heroic son, Emiel. To Emiel. To Emiel. Come. Watch out. How did it go at the Velvet Monkey? It isn't exactly my sort of place. I was glad to have watchman Goorissen with me. Did it all go according to plan or... Let's hope so. I conveyed our proposition to a shady-looking fellow. He said we'd hear soon from Iron Simon. I don't believe promises from people like that, but we'll see. I don't imagine they'll refuse. It's a good deal, with benefits for all parties. Apart from your slaves, Coffijn. Outlaws, Benoît, outlaws. It'll benefit them in the long run. If we show they're cooperating in progress, we also show they aren't totally rejected. We give them hope. - Really? - Yes. I wonder if Egyptian slaves thought that as they built the pyramids. I don't know. But those pyramids still stand. True. Our road will last as long... So many guards and weapons. It must be worth it. Come on. Stop. What's going on? Sorry, Mayor. This outlaw says he has a message for you. We tried to stop him from entering. Wait. Who is the message from? From who? Iron Simon. Go away. A deserter. A murderer. WANTED, JAN DE LICHTE There's a reward on your head. 2,000 florins. That's why these Austrians came. You don't know what happened there. It says here you killed Emiel Embo. The Spaniard wants my head, Jan. And 2,000 florins is a lot of money. If that's what you want, come and get me. I have no choice, Jan. You saved my skin, Tincke. Selling it now will gnaw at your conscience. You could take money from those who don't need it. And I know where. Mayor, what's so urgent... I have summoned you because I have great news. Meet one of the first workers who will work on the big road. We will get 200 in two teams of 100 so that we can work, work, work around the clock. The future smiles on us. - The Simon Company accepted. - Yes. It's in all our interests to start work immediately. Take him home with our agreement. And give Mr. Simon our greetings. To the future, and nothing else. And prosperity for us and our city. - Cheers. - Good health. Héloïse? Héloïse? We must be at the Van Gelderhode's in half an hour. I'm not going, father. I don't feel well enough to go hunting. Last time I hunted was with Emiel. Yes. Thoughts of Emiel keep me awake every night. And if sleep overwhelms me, I dream of him. Always something different. He is everywhere. Only time will heal this sorrow. Meanwhile, Héloïse, we must carry on. We have no choice. I know. I'll get ready. Stay on the edge of the hunting zone. Blend in. Only guns. We don't need more. Spare your strength for tomorrow. Let's go. Allow me, darling. I don't want anything to happen to you. Stay with the horses, I'll signal if all is safe. Put that down. Put it down. On your knees. - Now. - Yes. No. Jan? Come on. Get out of here. There's an ambitious plan. Devilishly ambitious. And it stands or falls with our cooperation. Together we are strong. Stronger than you think. We have nothing to lose... but it's dangerous. Every man must decide if they're in or not. If you don't dare, you don't win. What will it be? Are we doing this? Come on. Yeah. Mr. Baru? Mr. Rademaeckers. As agreed, Mr. Baru, my mother's birthday present. You do us both a great pleasure. I assure you. I will personally ensure that the chest arrives safely. I have full confidence. I appreciate this greatly. I'd like to repay you with an invitation for dinner on your return. An invitation I gladly accept. Didn't you bring anything else? It doesn't fit at all. Try it with the blouse. No. That won't help. It's her face. What about me? Yeah, you... You already look ridiculous enough. Take it off before it gets dirty. Maybe you should try. Your face won't be a problem. Watchman Goorissen? Until my return, you will be in charge of the Watch, as we agreed. Very well. Make us proud. I will. You may load the coach. After you. Go. Well, I'm never entirely at ease in the woods. They say it's haunted. Do you know what they call these woods? An oasis of horror in a desert of boredom. Tramps, whores, bandits. Woe betide those who crawl out of woods and rob our stagecoach. NEXT TIME They say he's totally twisted, that his legs are crooked and he has a gash across his face. He'll be dead in two minutes. The choice is yours. Look at us. Do I look like someone who'd fuck his own whores?
