 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES I curse you all. The Poulterer saved your life. I owe him my life. - You're a miracle, Jan de Lichte. - A saint who appears before us. I'm no saint. Drown in your own conceit, Pycke. Guards. - Jan de Lichte is alive. - We saw him die before our eyes. Handing over Jan was very brave of you. Traitor.

 I want to repay my debt. I love anything that's hard and strong. The future will vindicate me, you'll see. It's real gold. All are equal, all get the same. No bosses, no lords. Jan de Lichte said so. You leave us alone, we leave you alone. Easy. If you keep your word, you'll get the same in two months. You have to believe me. You won't find her here. Your daughter is a whore, Embo. I will personally drag her out of the woods and see to it that her life is over for good. Madame. Good evening.

 You're the second. I want to live. Let me live. No. After Coffijn's death, Jan's curse focused solely on Baru. And that was the beginning of the end. Dean Pycke. The Mayor. You wonder who will be next. Me. I am next. Why do you think that? Jan de Lichte cursed us just before he was hanged. Rest assured, I will not let this happen. We need to convene the town council. Right away. And I want constant protection. Of course. Food. Fresh from market. An apple for everyone. We'll soon be picking from our own trees. Here, Héloïse. Take care of this. Schnapps for you. Mr. Embo? Mr. Embo? The town council is meeting to suggest a successor. I'm worried. The brutality of De Lichte's gang is causing havoc in the city. I'm not sure if it will do us, and especially you, any good. Perhaps it's time to join forces? They brought it on themselves. They strung him up, but he survived. We have an agreement with De Lichte. We can't just break it. Chaos creates opportunities. Keep us informed. And make sure the new Mayor gets his cut. Of course. - We must be patient, Cross-Eyes. - I'm not so sure. If De Lichte dies, everything's ours. Maybe, Cross-Eyes. Maybe. Hey, Jan. - Jan. - Jan. We found this guy, wandering in the woods. We've roughed him up good. - Now we'll hang him. - No way. Take the hood off. My apologies, Mr. Embo. My apologies. It's all right, Jan. Father. The important thing is that Héloïse is alive. - Idiot. - Jan, we didn't know... Do you trust him? Yes. As expected, the murders of Coffijn and Dean Pycke are the work of Jan de Lichte. I thought he was dead. Many eye witnesses confirm he survived his hanging. He and his companions are entrenched in the woods. We know neither their number, nor their strength. But they are, as you already know, ruthless and know the forest like the back of their hand. I fear our City Watch is unable to stand up to them. It's not complicated, Baru. Just ask General De Rassinfosse for help. His troops are spoiling for a fight. I've already made a request to Sir De Rassinfosse and he will respond tomorrow. Until then, security at the gate will be tightened and the curfew adjusted. The city is ours. Very good, Bailiff. You're our most diligent member. Why not make the bailiff mayor? He's not even gentry. May I remind you, Count, that this is a crisis. And if anyone can save us, it is he. Our bailiff has little or no experience of such matters. Indeed, I am barely qualified. You are extremely qualified, young man. You have achieved much in a short time. What you lack in relations and ancestry, you make up for with your passion. - I vote for Baru. - Me too. Let us give him a title, he deserves one. Maybe. If it's for a short period. We could name him mayor temporarily, until the crisis is over. Who is for? We appoint you as temporary mayor for a period of three months. Mayor Baru, take a seat. - To the end of the Ancien Régime. - Let's drink to that. Cheers. Coffijn and Nicolaï's deaths will cause turmoil. They'll come after us. Whoever comes to power, will want only one thing: stability. They don't have the guts to come here. They're too scared. Yes, but for how long? We're weak. They overestimate us. Van Gelderhode won't take his son's death lightly. Those men are capable of anything. My condolences. I cannot imagine... We are paying the highest price for your inability to impose order here. I have lost all confidence in you, Bailiff. Or should I say Mayor? But the death of my son will not go unpunished. I fully understand your anger. But tomorrow I will convince the French to destroy the camp and therefore, your son's murderer too. - I advise you to... - I do not need your advice. Do what you have to do, but it won't stop me. May we? Yes. This disease is devouring my mind, Jan. If you see me start to do strange things... Don't say that, Tincke. When the time comes... you must help me, Jan. One bullet... We're not there yet. Get some rest. Well? We haven't seen her yet, and we've been here all day. Isabel's very worried. She'll be back. We both know her past. If you say so, Mr. Baru. Or should I say Mayor Baru? That's temporary, Magda. This city is in crisis and I'm the stopgap. - You're too modest. - Thank you for watching Isabel. I'll expect you in the barracks tomorrow. There's much to do. Hmm. - Who will look after her? - She can be alone for a while. Yes. As you wish. Where is Anne-Marie? I don't know, Mr. Baru. Did she say anything? Nothing. Come with me. What are you thinking about? Us. I want your baby, Jan. My apologies, General. But I am sure you understand, these are busy times. Of course. Jean-Philippe Baru, bailiff and mayor. Temporarily, until we ward off this crisis. How did it come to this? Have a seat. The outlaws in the woods have taken up arms. There are criminal elements among them now. A regrettable turn of events. I urge you to help us on a campaign to purge the woods. Such a pity. It would have been better warmed. It could be to your advantage. Really? You know that peace was signed yesterday in Aachen? The War of Austrian Succession is over. The Prussians will have Silesia and Austria, The Netherlands, including your little country. King Louis XV has invited us to head south of Tournai. - I'll be home before Christmas. - No. I'm as surprised as you. We've been here four years, two in your region, awaiting an order that never came. For who? The Prussian Sovereign. For Frederick the Great. Bailiff? Do you have two crystal glasses, to celebrate peace? Yes. Given the circumstances, I cannot help with your hunt. I wish you much success. You benefit from our services for two years, and this is how you thank us? We're all sentimentalists, my dear bailiff. But you must understand we are no longer interested in your castellany. You will again answer to the Austrian Empress and I'll calmly join my men over the border. Do you understand, Bailiff? Nice and calm. We will tolerate no accidents. Isabel? Isabel. - Anne-Marie? - Where's Isabel? Perhaps Mr. Baru took her to the town hall. Where were you? We were worried sick. What has he done with her? Done? Mr. Baru? I'll send a messenger to let him know you're here. I'll make tea. To attack with the City Watch would be suicide. If the French refuse, we must wait for the Austrian troops. That could take months. If the French don't want to get involved, we'll have to find a way to pull them in anyway. What do you mean? One of their soldiers could have an accident... We are officers of the law, Goorissen. Must I keep reminding you? Jan de Lichte is a man of his word. He's proved that. Can you live with the thought that every day could be your last? That the moment will come... when you turn around and look him right in the eyes. Number three. - Did you get my message? - Where is she? She's waiting inside. She's terrified something has happened to her sister. Where have you taken Isabel? You may go. If I need you, I will let you know. - And Isabel? - You have guts. You disappear and that same night, Coffijn is murdered. I'd like to believe you had nothing to do with it, but given your past in the woods, that seems most unlikely. Where is Isabel? Somewhere safe. She'll stay as long as I say. If you or anyone else messes with me, she'll starve to death. - What did she do to you? - Nothing. But you did. Yes. Yes, I handed Coffijn over to Jan. I was afraid, Mr. Baru. I betrayed him, and suddenly he's risen from the dead. You can have me. Do what you will with me, but let her go. I don't want you anymore. You are the enemy, Anne-Marie. You always have been. I've just realized. Go to Jan and tell him I want to speak to him. I will survive that talk because Isabel is my guarantee. After our talk, when I'm safely home, you get Isabel, and two seats on the coach to Ghent. And then I never want to see you again. You have guts. Whore. I'm here for Jan. We're even. You have no business here. Baru wants to talk to you. Let her go. Isabel? Isabel? May I leave? Almost. Here. Eat something. Please, Mr. Baru. I have a deal with your sister. It won't be long now. Magda? - I don't understand, Mr. Baru. - There's nothing to understand. What possessed you to follow me? This cannot be your true nature. Treating a child like this? Everything is different now. They're out to get me. Let me take her. Until this is over. Tomorrow you will leave town. For good. Or I'll have you arrested. Baru is a coward, Jan. Who are you really, Anne-Marie? I swore on my mother's deathbed that I'd take care of my sister. That's a heavy oath. - I gave you Coffijn, didn't I? - That's what scares me. I'll be there. But I don't give a damn about your sister. If anything happens to me, she dies. That's a promise. Go. - Thanks for coming alone. - You too. The city wants your head on a platter. - How will you get me this time? - I don't know. Neither do I know if that's what I want. Status quo. You leave us alone, we leave you alone. We commit no more crimes. You are completely safe. What's to stop you committing another crime? It's what you do. We don't need money anymore. - You have the gold. - So it seems. I knew it. Well, I suspected so. So Rademaeckers was a hero. As long as no crimes are committed, I can accept the status quo. If you or your people break your promise, this agreement ends immediately. Be careful, Jan de Lichte. You too. You too. He's here. Well? He showed up. Alone. He's shitting his pants. - We should have caught him. - Better a living ally than a dead enemy. Baru? An ally? He has the power now. And that's good. For him and for us. The agreement is that we lay low. - But we can't... - And we stick to it. The French will be gone soon. Until then, we stay calm. Are you sure, Jan? No. But I've bought us some time. I'll go now. Before I change my mind. You have been good to me, Baru. I'll give you that. But Jan has won. You lose. Even now, when you could do something about it, a cowardly deal to save your skin is all you're good for. You are a weak and lonely man, Baru. Occasionally, fatal turns are caused by great events. And this time was no different. Anne-Marie's final affront to Baru would irrevocably bring down disaster on all of us. Goodbye. Come with me, you. Mayor. It is done. The French will get the news by tomorrow morning. - How many? - As agreed. Two. There's no turning back now. - Stay around until the time comes. - Of course. They must have come this way back to camp. A shortcut through the woods. Witnesses say it was people from the commune who did it. You know, Jan de Lichte. He's Colonel Lahaut's son. He's already back in France. I promised his father I'd bring him home safe and sound. They only had one more week here. After four years of war, they were about to go home. My condolences, General. They must have thought your men were a threat to their commune. A threat? They don't know what a threat is. Meyvis. Shoe. Two French soldiers got killed. The French think we did it. - That means... - If they want revenge, they'll come here. - But will they bother? - We've been set up. You go, you too. Anyone can leave. Over my dead body. - I'm staying. - Let them come. Tell everyone and get all the weapons you can find. - It's war. It's war. - It's war. - It's war. Let's go. Everybody. - It's war. Jan was no hero. For heroes say goodbye. He saved us all from the great injustice that was playing out, but could not himself resist fighting against it. That this sealed his own fate, had no meaning for him at that moment. I may have lost a few battles against you. But the war... That, I win. I'm arresting you, Jan de Lichte. And this time, you won't escape your fate. You could have taken me alone. I will break you. All of you. It is not the dying, no matter how cruel, but the life that precedes it that gives meaning to this existence. Jan's belief in a better life lit up our dark world for a time. Like the stars in the black heavens. Sparkles of hope and love that we must cherish and hand down, because they show the way forward. Come, we're leaving. America's over there, right Mama? Yes, son, America's over there. Come on, let's go.
