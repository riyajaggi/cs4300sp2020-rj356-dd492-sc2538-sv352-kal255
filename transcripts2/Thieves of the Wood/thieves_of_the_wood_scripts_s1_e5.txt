 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES There's a reward on your head. It says here you killed Emiel Embo. You don't know what happened there. The Spaniard wants my head. PREVIOUSLY Ten thousand sols, by midnight on Sunday. You could take money from those who don't need it. Isabel is still in the orphanage. I trust you. And your sister trusts you.

 This is 100% pure opium. They say he's totally twisted. That his legs are crooked. He'll be dead in two minutes. We have your stuff. What did Iron Simon want to know? What? Did he have something in the stagecoach? I don't know. I'm arresting you. Wait. You attacked the stagecoach. I have every reason to doubt these suspects. I think they were brought in for the reward rather than because they actually robbed the coach.

 If you break off the engagement, you'll be thrown out of the higher circles and your name will be defiled, like that of your mother. Come on, you bums. You have to earn those two sols. Let's go. Come on. - Seen Jan? - No. Just last night at the camp. Off the cart. Get off the cart, or... Listen, you don't want to piss off my boss. Get off now or don't come back. Not here, or the camp. Nowhere. No bullshit. - Ah! Don't waste your time, Meyvis. Come. THE SIMON COMPANY The coach was a good start, but look at us now. Driving losers around to build a road. Stop whining. Hey. We're moving up, you just can't see it yet. Go. Trust Uncle Tincke. "Father, I write you this letter, saddened and with a heavy heart. A letter that no one should ever write or read." Here. You must eat. It might taste funny, but it will give you strength. I abandoned my father. He doesn't deserve that. Fate is not a thing you deserve. You endure it. Or take it into your own hands, like you did. Remember one thing, Héloïse. Your father lost you the instant he agreed to the marriage. I know. Where are you going? I need to go. Don't leave me alone. I'll take good care of you. Sir Baru? Sorry I'm late, but I can't always leave when I want to. I saw this at Au Beau Marché and I thought of you. Of me? You always have cold hands. I want to warm them up. Forever. They're so soft. I'm not worth it. You deserve it, Anne-Marie. You are a rare flower in these harsh parts. An edelweiss. You make me feel guilty, Sir Baru. I can't tell you much more than last time. It's not necessary. Your happy face gives me more satisfaction than the rest of my day. Did you know that they came to see the execution with their own eyes? Who? Jan, Tincke, the rest of the gang. They even took care of the executed man's children. Hypocrites. One day they'll pay. Even more than the innocent people they killed. And you will help me. As Virgin Mary is my witness. And Isabel? I'm a man of my word. Keep it up and you'll have a good future. Together. Where are Urkens' children? In my bed. They're finally asleep. They didn't stop crying. Even Mother Shoe couldn't comfort them. And the girl? She didn't say a word. She's an orphan because we attacked that coach. Urkens is dead because Coffijn hanged him. I summoned you, d'Embaux, because Mrs. Van Gelderhode told me she was worried. About Héloïse. She's rebellious. She walked out in the middle of dinner. That's true, Father. The circumstances require an apology, but none has been forthcoming. Father Pycke, I need your help. This period is forcing me to face my shortcomings. I tried to raise Héloïse to be a virtuous woman... but I have failed miserably. What have I done, for God to punish me so? First my wife... God is testing you. To see how strong you are. I fear I am not strong enough, Father. It was to be expected. The seed of evil is in your wife. Her sinful womb passed it on. Now it's manifesting itself in your daughter. And it goes deep. What did that woman do to you? She cuckolded you, Monsieur d'Embaux, with lesbian goings on. We must stop your daughter from treading the same path. Hm? My Héloïse isn't herself anymore since she heard about her brother's death. Do you have any idea where she went? I've looked everywhere in town... There will be a huge scandal if word gets out. The devil is in her. Evil infiltrated her body. The rot of your whorish wife festers inside her. We need to pray for her. And then I will treat her. A thorough cleansing. That's her only chance. Do you understand? Yes, Father. Bailiff. What a surprise. Are you checking progress on the road works? Can I ask you, are those corpses? Unfortunately, yes. Some of them sign up... against their better judgment. Against their better judgment? Hard work isn't for everyone. They overestimate themselves for a wage and a meal. But who could blame them? They die miserably anyway. Is that so? How may I help you? I'm looking for someone called Jan de Lichte. I've been told he's a leading figure for the outlaws. And since you're working with them, I was wondering if you know him. Or if you've seen him. Jan de Lichte? Hm, hm. I must disappoint you. I have no contact with the workers. I just check on the road works and ensure the schedule is followed. Which is so far not the case. The workers are being supplied, you say? Yes. The Simon Company is responsible for the workforce. Who's in charge? As the name suggests, a certain Simon. Also known as Iron Simon. Never heard of him. I'd keep it that way, if I were you. You have much to learn, Bailiff. Excuse me, I'm expected in town. Put it on the table. I feel and understand your anger, Benoît. But we cannot let emotion rule us on this matter. This marriage is above that. The interests are paramount. What interests, Dean? If that bitch engulfs us in scandal... We must and shall prevent that. With God's help. For now, no one knows and we'll keep it that way. We'll say that she's ill or there's a plague. That gives us time to get her back. How will you do that when no one knows where she is? Hm? You've heard what I've heard. She has been seen with some bum, a scumbag. Maybe even an outlaw. It's just rumour. You work with them. Can't you find a way to... No. If you bring Héloïse back, I promise I will break her rebellion. I will expel the devil in her. And when I'm done with her, she'll come crawling back to you, begging to marry your son. What if she doesn't return? If she's God knows where... I cannot bear to think of it. If there's any threat to your pure reputation... I will vilify her. I will vilify her entire family. I'll expose her father as a malevolent radical, who, influenced by bad books, tried to dishonour a good bourgeois family. Tincke. For days, I've been staring at this fire, or out of the window, Tincke. That's my world. My life. I tell myself this is enough. Because it's important to distance ourselves. Not to lose our overview. Do you get it? Hm. Yes. I hear good things about the Yellow Dick. A clean brothel. I didn't know that was possible. It sure is. I've got a couple of girls who can show men like you a good time... We had girls at the Velvet Monkey, too. Until the diseases came. Gonorrhoea, limp dick, syphilis, cunt fungus. Nasty. The Velvet Monkey isn't what it used to be. I thought, if you can make a pigsty like the Yellow Dick work... What do you think of the Velvet Monkey? I'm going to tell you something, Mister Simon... and if you think I should mind my own business, you're completely right. But... in my opinion, the Velvet Monkey... isn't run as well as it could be. I'm thinking of clean chicks, more gambling, more expensive booze. Maybe a spot where people can smoke some opium. Or some rooms upstairs to... Hm? I don't think it's that hard. Hear that, Cross-Eyes? Tincke here has a vision. Unlike you, with your fingers in the till. Bastard. Tincke, go to the Velvet Monkey and try something. Take some girls from the Yellow Dick and think about how you would handle it. And Cross-Eyes? Because... He'll cool down. The Spaniard will take care of you. If you say so, Mister Simon. You won't regret it. I've been asked to look for a certain Héloïse Embo. A bourgeois bitch who ran away. Probably to the woods. Maybe even to your camp. I haven't seen her, sorry. Listen, Tincke. If you find her within two days and send her back to her father, I'll make you the new boss of the Velvet Monkey. No conditions. Do we understand each other? Yes, Mister Simon. Find her, Tincke, and you can do whatever you want. My head is spinning. It's all moving too fast, Jan. Just the thought of abandoning my father forever... He wasn't against the marriage. You can't go back. They'll never let you go. I know. That's what makes it so hard. I just need time to think about it. Is Jan here? No. Dammit. Tincke, what's the matter? - What? - You leave the dirty work to us. Where were you all day? With Iron Simon, all right? Working on our future, if you let me. Shoe's been working, too. I know where we can find the key to a rich mansion close by. Sure. We just need to go in, empty the safe and get out. Hey, Tincke. - Hm. Zero effort, zero risk. The safe's not going anywhere. If you see Jan, tell him to go to the Velvet Monkey tonight. Ah, Baru. Thanks for coming so quickly. Take a seat. I hear you honoured the road works with a visit. That's right, Mayor. Er... I wanted information... I've not been for a while. How's it going? Well, I think. But young Van Gelderhode spoke of delays. It's always the case for big, complex works. It costs tons of money, but that's not my biggest worry. It's important that the road be finished as quickly as possible. Its importance for the prosperity of this town is not to be underestimated. Of course, Mayor. We need to let them do their work. Just as you do yours. Without any external interference. I understand. And how is your work going? I hear you do paperwork all day. I needed a study period, Mayor. To get to know your town better. Its structures, both above and underground. But I promise I will soon move into action. Good, Baru. Not you. You can go. No. Good. I don't even know where to begin. In your dreams. You too. Well... Be at the Velvet Monkey tonight. Make sure you're clean, ladies. - Let's go. - Hey. Why can't we go? Aren't we pretty enough? The Velvet Monkey is a classy joint, Djouffe. Listen to him. A real man wants a real woman. Not dolls like them. It's a question of environment, love. In this dark forest you might be an exotic orchid, but in the Velvet Monkey you look more like a dandelion. Judoca, open up the shop. Let's shag. Okay. Ah... Come on in. Here. Look at you. Do you know where Jan is? Tell him to go to the Velvet Monkey. It's urgent. It concerns our future, Marieke. Please. Choose another one. She's not available. Never again. Come on, plenty of choice. Did you really think I would leave you here? The prettiest flower of all. I have something special in mind for you. I was hoping so. Hm. Careful. Jan. Jan. Not in the stomach. - Ah. - No, wait. Ah. You're sure no one is home? Sir went to Paris. The janitor's there, but he's half blind. Let's go. Come on. Come. Look. All this will be ours, Anne-Marie. The girls take the clients upstairs. And then they pay you. You're serious? And you pay me. I thought you were joking. Come with me. This will be your room. And mine, if that's all right with you. What do you think? Our own room. Fancy, right? I've never had one. It would be nice if all the rooms were different. One time you're in a palace, another, in a nunnery. Or in China. You fuck your way around the world. - You've got some nice ideas. - Hm. Everything must be possible here, Anne-Marie. Everything. Drinking, gambling. Or just sitting, with one chick, two chicks... The client gets whatever he wants. Deal? You make me happy, Tincke. I'm going to make you a lot happier. It's not there. Are you sure it's here? The beggar kept saying it was in the second drawer. Meyvis. That's not a good idea. The janitor is still here. He's asleep. Be quiet and keep looking. Jan. We can see everything. Who cheats, which broad you're going to screw later... Everything. Yesterday, we were up to our knees in mud... and because of your genius, Jan, yours... we're here. That coach set it all in motion. There's one thing I don't get, Tincke. Surely Iron Simon didn't just give you this? Not just like that. He knows I'm smarter than Cross-Eyes and the Spaniard put together. I need to sort out one last thing and then it's ours. Meyvis, forget it, the asshole lied. We're close, I can feel it. Do whatever you want, I'm out of here. Ah! No, no. Oh... Look, Jan... I'll cut to the chase. A kind of... order has been disturbed. And you're the only one who can set it right. Because you disturbed it. Héloïse. Héloïse? How long can you hide her with the gypsies? None of your business. Well, that's where you're wrong. It is my business. Or I wouldn't be bothering you with it. This matter concerns all of us. Not only me. But also Iron Simon. And the Spaniard. And the gang too. We work on the road and our plans together. Everything is linked. Héloïse is a city girl. She has to go back. Back to her father. Back to her fiancé. I know, he's a disgusting clown, but it's none of our business. Héloïse belongs to another class, Jan. Leave her to them. Can you hear yourself, Tincke? Half an hour in that chair and you're a bigger asshole than Cross-Eyes. Héloïse won't go back. I'm disappointed, Jan. You're always going on about the public interest. About the people. But we finally get to see your true colours. You're an egotist, who, because of a stupid crush, without future... is willing to destroy people's lives. Make no mistake, my friend. Everyone loses if the roadworks come to a standstill. Everyone. Find someone else to restore your order, Tincke. You've got until tomorrow night. - Tincke... - What? - Is something wrong? - No, I want to be left alone. Authentic. Without a doubt. This doesn't lie. It says a lot. WANTED, JAN DE LICHTE Not only is Jan de Lichte a deserter, but this proves he is also a murderer. I must leave, before they notice. They'll catch on. Of course. - I'm sorry. - No need. I've rarely seen such courage in one person. Let alone in a young girl. Goodbye, Sir Baru. Bye, Anne-Marie. Vagenende. Vagenende. Do something. She's been stabbed. Do something. He's been drinking again. Take him, sober him up. Come. Let's go. We need to leave today. They know where we are. If we're not gone by sunset... they'll come and get you. But... I never wanted to force anything, Héloïse. Believe me. You'll have to choose. Today. I've already decided. I'm coming with you, Jan. My life in the city is not worth living. I know that. You're brave. Too brave for this world. There's just one thing... I need to do before we leave. I wrote a farewell note to my dad... That's too dangerous. You can't go into town now. But if you promise you'll be ready... when I come back, I'll take it. Fuck you, Jan. - Miss Embo? - Yes. For me? It shows that Jan de Lichte... killed your son. Dammit, Shoe. I thought I'd lost you. You shouldn't be here. A bottle and glasses, quickly. Tincke. Leave her alone. You need to pay for it. Can we keep it decent, please? You can fuck, but upstairs. You can drink too. But you have to pay for both. Who do we have here? The new boss of the Velvet Monkey. That's right. No problem, Tincke. We'll start with this. Everyone upstairs. Time to work. Let's sit on daddy. Go, go, go. Let's go. - Can you keep an eye on them? - Yes. Since you went to Iron Simon's, they haven't stopped drinking. - Let's have one, too, then. - Yes. Where's Héloïse? Where is she, Minna? Tincke came. She's gone. I'm sorry. She doesn't want to see her brother's murderer again. Jan, is it true? Did you murder her brother? No, Cross-Eyes. No. Go and get the healer. Now. Le Houcke, get Iron Simon. Now. Now. Hey. Come here. Press the wound firmly. Hide him. Far away. That scum... Who cares about him? Iron Simon. This is his son. Get it? Get out. If they find you, you're both dead. Tincke. Tincke. I want to kill him myself. NEXT TIME I'll bring his head to the farm in a sack. Tincke, Tincke, Tincke... He's really fucked up this time. Where's my money, my till, my gold? You crook. Jan, don't leave me. I beg you. You have balls, that we know. But brains? My name will be cleared. This child is not an offering. Behold the Holy Blood, you... Devil.
