 A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES PREVIOUSLY There's a reward on your head. 2,000 florins. That's why these Austrians came. Could you help us? It says here you killed Emiel Embo. You don't know what happened there. The Spaniard wants my head. Ten thousand sols, by midnight on Sunday. You could take money from those who don't need it.

 And I know where. So many guards and weapons. It must be worth it. No. Jan? My outlaws are my slaves, Benoît. The more men you need to build the big road, the more I'll banish. They'll work for less than nothing. If they don't, the gallows await. We're here with a proposition for Iron Simon, your boss. A proposition? Who are you?

 Urkens Senior, sir. Promise me one thing: that you'll never bow to any man again. Welcome to Flanders and happy hunting. Shush, come. Wait. There's an ambitious plan. Devilishly ambitious. And it stands or falls with our cooperation. Together we are strong. Stronger than you think. We have nothing to lose... but it's dangerous. She's having a fit. - Are you all right? - Stop the coach. - Madam. - Stop the coach. - Madam, are you all right? - Stop. Stop the coach. Ho. Ho. Anne-Marie? I'm sorry. Bye. Stop. Don't move. Stay seated. Ride's over, sweethearts. Get out. Come on. You too. Come on. I helped you escape those beasts at the castle. And now? I am obliged to arrest you. Isabel is still in the orphanage. I went there. I know the situation. Your shoes too, pal. Come on. We need fresh underwear, don't we, Meyvis? Off with them. Both of you. Let's go. Almost ready. Get the horses. No time. Off. Now. Good. I'll give you a head start. Then I'll send these two lunatics after you. I trust you. And your sister trusts you. Stand aside. Your prediction came true, Wisdom. Yes. What's that junk? Throw it out. No. We'll keep it. Gang mascot. What's that? Never seen anything like it. Yes. It's Christmas today. This is 100% pure opium. Uncut, from China. Around 100 grams? Times ten. A kilo of pure opium. - How much can we get for it? - A fortune. Only the very rich can afford this quality. The Mayor, the noble Lord Coffijn, promises 2,000 florins to anyone who can lead him to the perpetrators of these cruel and terrible crimes. The robbery of the stagecoach will and must not remain unpunished. 2,000 florins. Spread the word. Well now, the man of the moment. Mayor. An interesting case. The monthly stagecoach, attacked. In your presence. You were lucky to get away in one piece. And there were no deaths. If I may, three guards died. True. But it goes with the job. I have already met with Notary Woeste and Duke De Bonnefoie, who were... How can I put it? Quite upset, naturally. Any idea who is behind this? Not yet. It's too soon for that. But I assure you, I will catch them. Though I do not think, with all respect, that the reward you have posted is the right way to solve this case. Often... I don't give a damn, Baru. Two eminent citizens wandered for hours in the woods, robbed of their dignity. We're lucky they made it home alive. This is unacceptable. We must set an example. The people are afraid. I understand. But it is equally important that we catch those who are truly responsible for this attack. All I ask, Mayor, is time, to thoroughly investigate... That's the one thing I do not have, Baru. The time is now. But go ahead and catch them before we have to pay out. That would be best. But in any case, before the week is over... they will hang. Baru. The Spaniard? He's not here. Where is he then? Listen, girl. The Spaniard's busy. He's lost something. You'll have to come back. I've come to pay Tincke's debt. Ten thousand sols. He had a bit of luck yesterday. Tell the Spaniard we were here. You can leave the money here. We'll be back. As long as we are obedient, dear parishioners, as long as we humbly know our place... as long as we truly shy away in fear from God's wrath. Woe, woe betide those who believe they can avoid the wrath of Almighty God. Tramps. Whores. Bandits. Woe unto you. Woe betide those who crawl out of muddy woods and rob our stagecoach. They will get the punishment they deserve. They will pay eternally. Now and in the hereafter. Stay on the righteous path, I'm warning you. Out, infidel devils. Out of our pure parish. They left half an hour ago. In which direction? North, they said. Do you know the precise location? A sort of farm. Heavily armed. Is that Iron Simon's headquarters? I don't know. They say he's totally twisted. That his legs are crooked and he has a gash across his face. He wants to know where his stuff is. Ten ceramic balls. We know nothing about that. Hey, hey. We didn't come here for that. He'll be dead in two minutes. Unless the surgeon does something. We have your stuff. You'll get it all back. Jesus, why do men do such things? What did Iron Simon want to know? What? Did he have something in the stagecoach? I don't know. When they came back, his wrist was sewn up. He was totally dazed. Meyvis? You've been away so long. Everything all right? Hello. It wasn't supposed to be this way. It's the best thing that could happen to us, buddy. Really. Hey, Iron's crazy for us. Nice little fellow. A Scheldt Poodle? No, a lousy dachshund. Still, not bad. Cross-Eyes, drop it. There's no reason not to trust these men. Let's go. Goodbye. Hey. Hey. I was worried. For me? At the Yellow Dick they said you'd been taken. I'm back now. You'll never guess who I just met. I never thought you'd find out so much so fast. Are you cold? Just my hands. You've been a great help. But a lot is happening in those woods. I want to know what and where. And my sister, Isabel? All in good time. Here. For you. Thank you, Mr. Baru. Would you like some? I find it fine, that you have good manners. Oh... Oh... Oh. - Hey. - Sit still. Name? Urkens. Urkens' Gang. Has a ring to it. I'm arresting you. Tie them up. Just because we're eating and drinking? No, because you attacked the stagecoach. - Wait... - Everyone on the ground. Do as we say. Hey. Right now. Le Houcke... you can't do that. Everyone on the ground. Sit. It went well. Clever. You know they won't stop looking until the robbers are strung up? For you. If you need anything later, or for the girls. - I can't take this, Jan. - Yes, you can. You do good work, Judoca. Tincke doesn't see it. He only thinks of himself. He forgets those around him. That stagecoach isn't just his, it belongs to us all. Thank you. Truly. Hide that. So, we have Tincke, Meyvis, Vagenende, Shoe, Little Apple, Little Cherry... Such funny names. Then the big man, Jan de Lichte. What makes you think he's the leader? A petty thief doesn't suddenly rob a coach. The stagecoach was his idea. Will you catch them? In due time. These gangs know the land like the back of their hand. If they use the money to buy guns, there'll be a bloodbath. Your informant knows a lot. Enter. Sorry for the disturbance. I have great news. Bailiff. These gentlemen have risked their lives to catch the stagecoach robbers. Really? Yes, Bailiff. It's the Urkens Gang. They've been sowing terror in the woods. We have... The Urkens Gang? Yes. That's right. They're safely locked in the belfry so I could notify you. All right. Let's go and take a look. Bailiff, if I may, what about our reward? If the perpetrators really are the Urkens Gang, you will be paid. I'd like to stress that... Which of you is Urkens? Me, sir. My name is Baru. I'm the bailiff. You and your friends are accused of a serious criminal act. What do you have to say? We know nothing about the stagecoach. You must believe us. Look at us. We're too weak. We're in no state for such violence. Wait, Bailiff. You must believe us. Please stay. We didn't see the stagecoach, I swear. Bailiff. - Mayor. - Baru. Notary Woeste is here to make a formal identification. It shows courage, dear Notary, that you are already willing to confront the possible perpetrators of the nightmare you endured. Yes. The sooner you put this behind you, the better. Before that, I would first like to talk to the mayor. In private, if possible. Certainly. Mayor, with all respect, as representative of the law, I must ensure we do not act hastily. I have every reason to doubt these suspects.. I think they were brought in for the reward rather than because they actually robbed the coach. That's why I brought Woeste. Only he can give a definitive answer. I too am a witness. I was on that coach. I do not recognize them at all. Both Woeste and De Bonnefoie said that you ran away. Perhaps... you don't recognize them because you simply... did not see them. Goorissen. Take your time, Woeste. Thank you. We want the real criminals. Of course. Sir, have mercy, please. Sir, have mercy, please. Well? I recognize them. Are you sure? They were just a meter away. They humiliated me, took my clothes. I'm sure. If you'll excuse me. There, a formal identification. Tomorrow we'll get a full confession. If I may, Mayor, there is much room for error. The lighting in here is... Don't be sad that a crime is quickly solved. - With your ambition. - They are vagrants. Do you think the real bandits would let bounty hunters get them? Do you? Lord. Forgive me my sins... that the beautiful Héloïse brought upon me. I am weakened, Lord. Heal me. Save my life. You see my bones tremble. Thus your hand strikes me down. Have you come to rob me, Jan de Lichte? I'm here to apologize. I didn't mean to scare you. You didn't mean to shove your gun at me? Is that why you came back? To fight a war here? Perhaps I should be grateful. I got to know my future husband better. Don't marry that bourgeois fool. Will you save me? If you want to be saved... I can take care of it. Did I tell you you're my favourite here? Not really. No? Well now you know. The moment you stepped onto the coach, I knew I had to keep an eye on you. You're no ordinary girl. I like that, a girl with balls and brains. Not many can say that here. Want to go out back? Do I look like a john? Like someone who'd fuck his own whores? I don't think so. You don't know me. It might not seem so at first sight... but I'm a romantic. A courtly prince, so to say. A poet in thought. It all happens here for me. And here. For you too. I see that. Here. Take a drag and hold it in. Yes. Everyone out. Tincke, it's a beautiful day. We can see the future taking shape. That's progress. Come on. This is our chief of works, Sir Van Gelderhode. Tincke and Jan, some of my staff. Twelve teams of twelve, 15 meters apart. Pickaxes, shovels, then rollers. Pick up the pace. Without those whips you'll get more done, boss. Do I have to meet all your workers, Cross-Eyes? I don't want to see them again. Regarding the attack on the coach and theft of the prayer money, 100,000 florins, theft of state property and substantial damage to the stagecoach. All this I confess, leader of Urkens' Gang, Urkens Senior. I confess... everything. Justice be done. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a third highwayman approach. I aimed my pistol at his foul mug. The scum retreated: "No sir, please, don't shoot." I immediately took care of Héloïse and with a well-aimed kick with my hunting boot, chased him back into the woods. My son. You could have died. Mother, they were only outlaws. Those depraved men never succeed. How dumb do you have to be... to bother a hunting party? Really. You should have handed them over to the City Watch. But we can't hang all of them. Some of them we have good use for, sweetheart. Héloïse? Héloïse? Is all well with you, darling? Did I say something wrong? You know well enough. You make the hunting party sound idyllic. You lied to them about the stolen weapons and the robbery, that's fine by me. But you have said nothing to me about it. No apology, nothing. What are you talking about? You just left me there. Who would believe you? People talk about you. That you have your mother's nature, for example. People haven't forgotten the scandal. If I was you, I'd be careful and tell no one. You should be happy I still want to marry you. Or better still, that my father wants it. I wouldn't marry a man like you. Coward. If you break off the engagement, you'll be thrown out of the higher circles and your name will be defiled, like that of your mother. Yes. You will never marry. You can be an old spinster, Héloïse... or you can marry me. The choice is yours. Mr. Urkens, I have read your confession. And I'm wondering if you have anything more to add. You should know that, given the seriousness of the crime, the punishment will be expedited. You will be executed tomorrow. Perhaps you know something that will shed different light on this case. You know I didn't do it. Yet I am guilty. You come here to soothe your conscience. I confessed and have nothing more to add. I know it was Jan de Lichte. He should be here, not you. Tell me what you know about him and I will pardon you. I did it. I did it. Ah. Ah. "Dear brother, as you will have noticed, I was unable to come to our meeting. A matter of force majeure. The coach I travelled in was brutally attacked." The Urkens Gang has been found guilty of robbing a stagecoach. "With deep regret..." Without compassion and armed. They are condemned to death by hanging. Their leader, Urkens Senior, will be the first punished, in the cruellest manner: slow hanging. Are you sure you don't want to see the hanging outside? New paragraph. "Dear brother, as I'm writing this letter, outside, seven innocent tramps... are being strung up. It is a mockery. Of which I have seen many in this city. It is sometimes said... that the people need a scapegoat... to give full vent to their vengeful lust. For their leaders, it is proof of their power. They give... and they take away." Any news of the luggage in the coach? Gone, I'm afraid. None of the bastards are talking. Not even under the worst torture. You have to admire them. Did you send something on the coach? A gift. I asked the bailiff to hand it over in Ghent. Baru? "I, Jean-Philippe Baru, bailiff of this city... will make it my mission to bring justice to this wasteland. The innocent must be helped to stay on the righteous path. And those who are truly guilty... will feel the cruel hammer of justice come down on them. I shall be... ruthless." Evil has infiltrated her body. The rot of your whorish wife festers inside her. NEXT TIME Gonorrhoea, limp dick, syphilis, cunt fungus. Nasty. She doesn't want to see her brother's murderer again. Héloïse is a city girl, Jan. You've just taken over and you're a bigger asshole than Cross-Eyes. - Ah. - You have much to learn, Baru. If there's any damage to your pure reputation, I will vilify her. No...
