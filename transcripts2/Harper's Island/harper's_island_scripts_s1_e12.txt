 Harper's Island (2009): Season 1, Episode 12 - Gasp - full transcript 
 Sully and Danny flush out a killer; when Abby can't finish him off, he's dragged to jail instead. Feeling safer now, the friends split up. Sully tries his hand at interrogation as well as fixing a radio. Abby retrieves Shea and Madison; Henry goes to fetch Trish, but she has been lured out to the bluffs by Jimmy with talk of a rescue boat. Abby confronts one killer, but Madison soon reveals that her kidnapper had a "friend." Shea shares her discovery with the others; when Jimmy reports back that Trish accidentally slipped down the rocks, suspicion immediately falls on him. The friends again split up to rescue Trish while guarding the prisoner, who uses the moment to escape and take another victim. A tense standoff is diffused when Trish turns up safe; a boathouse radio could finally bring help. Not realizing that the killer is again loose, Trish makes love to Henry in their cabin, but he is lured out by a strange knock at the door. Shea and Madison must run to Sully for help. Alone in the woods, Jimmy tells Abby he has a long-standing confession to make. A second killer is revealed.

 My name is Abby Mills, and I've come home to Harper's Island. My best friend was supposed to Marry the girl of his dreams, but something terrible has happened. People are being killed... ...and John Wakefield is alive. And he's intent on killing us all. There are only a handful of us left. We don't know who to trust or where to turn, but we have to stick together and fight back if we don't want to die.

 Previously on Harper's Island: Am I Wakefield's child?! No. You're my daughter. This will never be over until he's dead. You can finish Wakefield. Abby! He's getting away. No, we'll get him, but not like this. We got to be smart. There are three entrances to the tunnels. If we block all those, he'll be trapped. Trish, you and Jimmy block off that storm drain entrance. Mom, the sheriff has lots

 of stuff on someone else we know. What is it? You shouldn't sleep with a loaded gun. Wait, w-wait. What if Wakefield goes back for the others? He'll go back to the tunnels. Come on, this way. Watch out. How are we supposed to find anybody in all this... nature? Well, we could split up. Yeah, yeah, let's make it easier for the psychopath to kill us. We'd cover more ground that way. If we stick together, we have each other's back. Look, he's not an army. Okay? He's just one guy. Right? There's a ship. What? Where? About a quarter mile back-- some kind of freighter. That's great. Yeah. How did you see it? I was on the bluffs. You left me here alone? There we go. If we can signal it, we can all get out of here. Jimmy, Henry said to stay with the car. The car's blocking the tunnel grate. Wakefield's not getting out of there. Do you want to get off this rock or not? Come on. I told you it would work. Yeah. Next time you're the bait. He's all yours, Abby. Sync by honeybunny  corrections by aydin1954 www.addic7ed.com What was that? We should kill the bastard. Come on, man, that's not our job. Says who? The guy deserves to die. Nobody's arguing that. Then we should do it. It's over. We got him. I vote we tie him up, let the police take care of it. That's a big mistake. Where is it? I swear it was just... A small freighter. How could it pass so fast? I don't know. Tie him up. You did the right thing. My dad told me to kill him, and I didn't. He knew I wouldn't. Hey, you're not him. But he killed my mom and dad, everyone we loved. Abby, you're not a killer. How the hell did he survive? What does it matter? Cal, Chloe... lots of people would still be alive... Sully. I'm just saying the sheriff should have made sure he was dead. Dude, the sheriff shot him and he fell off a cliff. Sounds pretty dead to me. So what happened? Tide roll in? I'm gonna go get Trish. She and Jimmy should be waiting for us by the grate. Okay, I'll go to my dad's, get Shea and Madison. Then what? Well, what about the state cops who were killed? Somebody's got to come looking for them. Well, I'm not waiting around. There's got to be a radio somewhere on this island. We should go door to door until we find one. All right, then let's meet back here. Are you sure this is the best place? Well, this is where the cops'll come when they get here. Wakefield's locked up. It's safe. Guy's locked up. Why don't I feel safe? Because he's still alive. What are you doing? You know, we did the right thing. If we killed him, we'd never get any answers. Abby, Henry... they deserve that. Don't you want to know why? Come on. Hey. What is that? Sully, hey, come on, man, don't do this. Back away from the bars. Sully. I said back away from the bars. He didn't back away. Come on, let's get him out of here. Trish? Trish! Trish! Hey. He give you any problems? No. It's cool. What's that? It's a radio. Pretty smashed up. I can see that. Maybe it needs some batteries. Yeah, it needs batteries and a tuner, a transistor, maybe some wiring. Yeah. You just need a new one, I think. Honey, let's just give him some thinking space, okay? Trish and Jimmy weren't at the car. I searched all around-- I can't find them. It-it couldn't be Wakefield. He-he was nowhere near Nikki's car. I left them a note saying we were at the sheriff's station. I told them we've got Wakefield. Why did they leave the car? ABBY: Look, Henry, she's with Jimmy. I'm sure they're okay. Yeah. I found something at the sheriff's house. In the attic. What? It was a file. There was a mug shot of Jimmy. Arrest records. He was arrested here on the island. What for? I-I mean, a lot of the guys... He was also a murder suspect. In Seattle. The Wakefield copycat. Your dad was looking at Jimmy? Abby? John Wakefield wants to talk to you. Jimmy and Trish. What have you done with them? I know what you're trying to do. Well, you can't turn me against Jimmy the way you did with my dad. You wanted to humiliate him... blame him for the deaths. Why are we still talking about your dad? He's dead. So, why didn't it end there? Why keep killing? Because of you. What do you want from me? Did she love him? What? Sarah. Did she love your father? Or was he just... taking care of her? My mom loved my dad. They were very happy together. If she loved him so much, why didn't she tell him... about our child? Henry, I know you don't want to believe it because Jimmy's your friend, but it's just too weird. Jimmy's boat explodes, but he survives. Then, Wakefield gives him a lift to The Cannery instead of killing him 'cause-- I don't know-- he's that kind of guy. No, Wakefield was just using Jimmy. He was bait to get Abby to the hotel. Okay, but then he sleeps through The Cannery bloodbath. Shows up at the church rubbing his eyes. Really? Three times, he walks away from death. The head spade rig at the church. Jimmy's a fisherman, right? Works with that kind of thing all the time. But why? Jimmy hardly knew my dad. Or anyone else at the wedding. Abby. Yeah. Yeah, this all started when she came back to the island. I mean, Jimmy hadn't seen her in what, like seven years? He must have hated that. He was pretty torn up. Maybe he really wanted to hurt her. What better way than to throw in with Wakefield? Jimmy and Wakefield? She never said anything about having a child. Maybe it isn't even true. Fantasies of a caged man. But you've thought about it. Even thought it could be you. I'm not yours. No, 'cause if you were, you would have figured all this out by now. To think Sarah gave up my child... but kept you. My mom could never love a man like you. My baby... was inside your mother... before she ever dreamed of you, Abby. I got to find Trish. I'll go with you. Where is Trish? She fell at the bluffs. I couldn't get to her. We got to get out there. Wait, the bluffs... what were you doing at the bluffs? You were supposed to stay at the grate. We were trying to flag a ship. Look, wh-what's it matter? We got to get rope... What is this? You don't need it anymore. We already got Wakefield. Remember? Yeah, no, look, I got the note, and that's great... Look, I don't know what's going on around here, but Trish is in trouble. Are we going to help her or not? Oh, you think you meant something to her? Is that what you want to hear? I loved her. No. No. You killed her. She stole from me. Threw away my child. My family. There's a price for that. What kind of bitch gives up her own child? How do you even know she had your child? Because I found him. What did you do?! What are you talking about? -You're lying! -Hey, what are you doing? Henry, Henry! What is this? You tell me. Where's Trish? She fell. Abby, I-I just came here to get help. Abby, what the hell is going on around here? There have been some questions... Is she dead? Like I said, she fell. You know, the more you say that, the worse it sounds. Okay, look. What if... what if it's true? What if your fiancée is in trouble and we're just standing around? He's lying. We'll get rope. You take us to the bluffs. If Trish isn't there... Well, I'm going with you. When we got here, the ship was gone. Trish lost her footing and fell over the edge about halfway down. Trish?! Trish! Trish! I tried to get down there, but the rocks are slippery. Well, why didn't you find another way down? -Couldn't get close enough. -There's a ledge. If she fell, maybe she's down there and we can't see her. If she fell... or if she was pushed. Trish! We got to get down there. I'm going first. Okay, so we've got crackers and cheese product, half a candy bar, instant coffee and some sort of... cherry breakfast thing. I'll take that. I thought you don't eat red. Or green or blue or brown. I'm so hungry, I'd eat purple. They'll have your sister back any time. What are they going to do to Wakefield? Well, there'll be a trial, a judge will find him guilty, and he'll go away forever. I'm so hungry. I know. We haven't really eaten anything in days. I ate. When? I ate in the tunnels. He gave you food? Someone brought it to us. Did you see who it was? I only heard his footsteps when he brought it. Honey, why didn't you tell us there was someone else there before? I'm sorry. Hey, hey, it's okay. It just means that Wakefield has a helper, and we didn't know that. Tell me where she is or I swear I will blow you away. Henry! Get out of the way, Abby. I won't let you do this. He is working with Wakefield. What? Henry, put the gun down. This is what Wakefield wants! He killed Trish, Abby, I know it. He helped kill all of 'em. Look, it's Jimmy. You've known him your whole life. Think about it. It's your last chance, Abs. Get out of the way. Abby. This is crazy. Jimmy! Really? You're going to shoot me? Henry, please. You're not a killer either. Henry! Henry! Oh, my God. I thought you were dead. Yeah. Yeah, I kind of did, too. I lost my grip on the ledge and landed in the water. Are you okay? Yeah. You guys, I found a boathouse. There's a radio. Come on. This it? Yeah, come on. It's in here. Look. It has power, but I wasn't able to reach anyone. The U.S. Coast Guard has a distress channel here. Mayday, Mayday. U.S. Coast Guard, this is Harper's Island requesting immediate assistance. Over. Mayday, Mayday. U.S. Coast Guard, this is Harper's Island. Over. Mayday, Mayday. U.S. Coast Guard, this is Harper's Island requesting immediate assistance. Over. It's not transmitting. Could be the antenna. Let me see. No, I can fix it. Let me see it. Come on. Henry. Mayday, Mayday. This is Harper's Island. You were going to kill him? I was worried about Trish. When Shea found that mug shot... Hey. Hello, anyone out there? What... what are you talking about? The sheriff had a file on Jimmy. Yeah, that was before he knew Wakefield was still alive. SULLY: Hello, anyone there? When you weren't at the car... some people thought... We thought that Jimmy might be helping Wakefield. Mayday, Mayday. Anyone there? We caught Wakefield. Wakefield's in jail. Why would Jimmy...? He said you fell off a cliff. It seemed far-fetched. But it was an accident, right? Come on, we need you guys. Yeah. Yeah, it was my fault. I slipped. So nothing felt off at the bluffs when there was no boat? Again, this is Harper's Island. Please come in. This is U.S. Coast Guard, Port of Seattle. Person in distress, give us your location. Over. Huh? You found it. Do the honors. This is Trish Wellington calling from Harper's Island. We need help. Roger that, Harper's Island. What's the emergency? Over. There's a murderer here-- John Wakefield. He's killed people-- dozens. My father, the sheriff. Look, we've caught him, but now we're stuck here and we need to get off the island. We're with you, Harper's Island. Sit tight. Police and rescue teams are on their way. Ask him how long. How long do you think that'll be? We've got weather over here, but we'll do everything possible. Four hours at the most. Stay by the radio so we can reach you. Roger that. Mm. We're going home. Someone should stay with the radio until they get here. I'll do it. I'll do it. It's safe now. Why don't you take Trish back to the Candlewick, find her some dry clothes? She's right. You're freezing. Some dry clothes would be nice, maybe a hot shower. I'll go to the station with Jimmy, let everyone know help is coming. You sure you don't want to stay here with me? You got something you want to say? Jimmy, don't. Here. Abby. Take it. We'll see you back at the station. I still don't trust him. Feeling better? Yeah. Wakefield's in jail. Help's on the way. Now all I need are some dry clothes. I'm gonna go find my suitcase. Yours is on the bed. Henry. Yeah. Be careful. I will. I'm back. I think I got everyone's. Mine's, Shea's, Madison's. I love you. Thanks, Danny. When's the last time you got any sleep? Uh... three days ago. Hmm. Afraid to close my eyes, you know? Madison, um, are you sure there was someone else down in the tunnels? Are you sure it was a guy? Not really. Well, you never heard any voices or anything? Was he always bad? I mean, even as a kid? Well, it's hard to say. Some people have horrible lives. Turns them bad. He was in prison for a long time. That can change someone. No, not him. John Wakefield was born bad. You know, when you left the way you did, I was really pissed. Got in some fights. Your dad had me spend a couple nights in jail. Cool off. What about the rest? The thing in Seattle. Why didn't you tell me? That was nothing. I went to Seattle, tried to get some work on the docks. Guy got killed there, and I was sleeping in my truck. Nobody knew me, so the police took me in. They checked me out, let me go. No big deal. But why did my dad keep your file in his Wakefield room? He was a good cop, Abby. What do you mean? I mean... our breakfasts, the fishing trips. He was keeping me close, you know? He could sense how angry I was. Angry? Abby, hey. I need to confess something. After you left... I swore, if I ever saw you again, I'd break your heart. I wanted to hurt you worse than you hurt me. Make you pay. But when I saw you walk off that boat... when I saw you all grown up, so beautiful... ...all those feelings fell away. All I felt... ...was love. It's a good story. It's a weird story. No, it's not. Come on! The old lady tries to eat Hansel and Gretel. She's a witch. Now, frogs I get. Witches can eat frogs, but kids? Madison! Oh, my God. Shea, get out of here! Madison, go! We should get going. I know. We're going home. Yep. Thanks to you. You kept us safe, Henry. You. Yeah? Hello? Henry. It's okay. It's okay. Hello! Henry? What's going on? Stay here. No. Henry, Henry, wait. Lock the door. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. You hear that? Shea? Wakefield escaped. What? How? I don't know. Where's Danny? He fought off Wakefield so we could get away. Did you find my sister? Yeah, she's with Henry at the Candlewick. We have to let them know. Okay, Shea. Follow the path. There's a turnoff at Nichols Road by the old barn. It leads to a boathouse. Sully's there with a radio. Tell the cops Wakefield's out. But... Wait there for us, okay? You know how to shoot? Keep your daughter safe. Come on! Henry? Henry? Who is that? Who's there? Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Henry? Trish. Oh, my God. I've got you. It's okay, it's okay. I thought he killed you. I'm fine. I'm fine. Wakefield escaped. Henry, Wakefield escaped. We have to go. I know. I gave him the key. What? Sully was right. Wakefield has an accomplice. It's just not Jimmy. No. No. Look, I know how hard this must be for you. No. You're lying! Trish, stop it. Stop it. Trish. Stop it! Don't make this harder than it is. It had to happen at our wedding. I needed everyone here. You see? You killed them. You killed... my father... and JD. Oh... oh, my God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, they had to go. It was part of the plan. But I really wanted to give you the wedding. You bastard. You bastard! You bastard! It's not fair. It's not fair. It's not fair. Hey, Dad.
