 Put it somewhere where no one's gonna find it for a few days. It's me, it's cool. Booth, y-you shot yourself. Booth! Hey, have you, have you seen Booth? N-No. And now Mr. Wellington will come up d light the unity candle. I'd recommend you all stay together. This is no time for anyone to be off on their own. Before the rehearsal, JD and I got into a fight. He said he had one last surprise r me. I have some questions to ask about what happened this afternoon. Maybe I should start with you. I have not been charged with anything, and I'm not saying another word without you present. I want you to fight for shared...

 What are they doing here? I-Is that bad? You think they figured out who killed Mr. Wellington? Did anybody else hear it might be Henry's brother? No. I thought they were talking to what's-his-name, you know, Trish's brother-in-law. - What, Richard? Really? - Yeah. Seems to me it could be anybody. Don't say that. It can't be "anybody." Why couldn't the boat have just come this morning? The sheriff here yet? Yeah. Upstairs. I heard he's going to search rooms. I thought he needed a warrant or something. Hey, if it helps him find the killer, he can do whatever the hell he wants to my room. Yeah, mine, too. I'm just going to go finish packing up. Where's Daddy? I'm not sure. He's around. Is he gone because of what I told the sheriff? No, honey, of course not. Is he gone because he killed Grandpa? Madison... no. Daddy loved your grandpa. Just a sec. I'm coming. I was just, you know, uh, I was packing. I ju wanted to thank you for yesterday. I'm still totally freaked out. But you coming and sitting with me last night was really sweet. - Really? - Yeah. I'm, I'm glad. I mean, it was my pleasure. N-Not my pleasure, but... No, I get it. Okay, uh, uh... thanks for the thanks. Okay... yeah. Okay, I'll, uh, I-I'll see you at the boat. It's going to be okay, Beth. - Yeah. - Okay. Crap. Trish, we should talk about today. There's a charter boat coming to take everyone back to Seattle this afternoon around 4:00. There's one thing you should know. The sheriff isn't ready to release your father's body yet. I-If it's okay with you, instead of going back, I can stay here and make all the arrangements for your dad, when the time comes. Okay. People are asking about the wedding. Okay. What are you doing here? Heard about Trish's dad and wanted to see how you were doing. Honestly, um, I don't know. Everything's happened so fast. People in this town are freaking out. I mean, the way Wellington died-- it reminds them of before. Yeah, everyone here just-- they're afraid to go outside. - They just want to go home. - Home. Funny word, huh? I guess you'll never be coming back home again. Anyway... that's why I came here. I just wanted to say good-bye. - Worried I was going to sneak out on you again? - Crossed my mind. It just seems like something's always in our way. I know. Story of our lives. {\a6}****** You realize that camping with a guy means sex, right? - Says who? - Like, everyone. Like Angie Volare, Janine Marquez. Janine? Really? Who'd she camp with? I swore I'd never tell. - Nikki... - Shane Pierce. It's creepy, right? Look, I'm not saying I'm going to do anything, but... well, we've been going out for a while, and, you know, I'm going off to college in the fall and... And he's got that killer smile. I just think it's right. You know? I concur. I mean, if we're meant and we love each other, shouldn't we go for it? Absolutely. - how much did you hear? - What? Nothing. I swear. So, um... are we going camping tonight? didn't you have to go do that... thing? Oh, right, mm-hmm. Yeah, I have to go and, um... Bye. - So? - Yes. Yeah? Something I can do for you, Henry? I heard you were searching JD's room. What do you know about this? Were you going to tell me that your brother put that dead raccoon in the church? I was trying to protect him. Let me show you something. I'm pretty sure he stopped taking these. Stopped? Yeah, we fight about it a lot, actually. JD doesn't like his meds. He says it makes him feel foggy. Well, what I want to know is if your brother is depressed or psychotic enough to kill. - I want to say no. - I'm sure you do, but is it the truth? - Is this JD's? - I can check. Well, you're in here. Looks like we found our killer. We found Uncle Marty's phone in JD's room. I don't believe it. Your dad sure does. How is Trish ever going to look at me again? I'm the brother of the guy who killed her dad. Even if it is JD, she won't blame you. She just did. She didn't say it, but... How can I help? You going to use dogs to find JD? I've got to find him fast. It's not lost on folks that Wellington was killed with a head spade. - I want to come with you. - Doesn't work like that, Henry. Please, I won't interfere. I just feel like somehow I'm responsible. Maybe I can help talk JD down. I won't get in your way. I promise. Stay back. With me. Here you go, boy. Take a sniff. Come in. Um, I brought you something to eat, because... I figured you haven't... For a second... when you knocked... I thought you were my dad. - I'm sorry. - No. No, it was a good feeling. Like he's still here. What time is it? a little after 10:00. He's supposed to be walking me down the aisle right now. Now I'll never know... No need to go there. Not now. Did you hear about JD? The cell phone in his bedroom? Yeah. I don't care that he's Henry's brother. I hope they kill him. I understand. I felt the same way after my mom was killed. I didn't want them to just catch John Wakefield. I wanted him dead for what he did. I just can't believe my dad's gone... forever. I don't see what the big deal is. Me and Nikki are just going to camp out tonight. - You mean you and Jimmy? - Mom. How can you even say that? That is so not true. Look, you're too young to be dating a boy like that. What do you mean, "a boy like that"? Don't get me wrong, okay? He's charming, he's fun, but he's a bit of a wild card. I used to date guys like that. Yeah, but you went with the safe bet. Your father treats us very well. Is that all you want? To be treated well? What about love and passion? - Your father's a passionate man. - Really? He's passionate about hating Jimmy. Talk to your dad. Tell him how much you love him. I told my mom, after. I don't know why, but... it helped. You mean after she was... Yeah. Before the funeral, I went to see her. I needed to say some things. I couldn't. Well, you don't have to. But... is there anything you'd like to say to him? just would have done things differently had I know it was our last day together. Mom. I want you home before breakfast, okay? I promise. Don't tell Dad, okay? I thought you were going camping with Nikki. Right. I am. Bye. How did it go? Fine, but I hate lying to my mom, even if she knows. Well, she cares. I mean, my folks wouldn't even notice if I disappeared for a week. ******** Man, what have you got in here? I was so nervous with my mom, think I put like ten books in there. - I'm glad we're finally doing this. - Me, too. You ever think about what will happen after you go away to school? What do you mean? Come on, I mean, you'll be away at college. I'll be working here. Henry and Trish go to different colleges. They're still together. I'll come home a lot or... you can visit me. You ever think they'll get married? - Who? Henry and Trish? - Yeah. They seem pretty perfect. You know who else is pretty perfect? Oh, my God. Come on, come on. Before we left, you said you felt like you were responsible? I should have done more after our parents died. I guess I kind of saw it coming. You know, the way JD started dressing, the tats... Something in him broke. And I just went back to school. I had my own problems, and he was left with Uncle Marty. Your uncle was JD's legal guardian? Yeah, look, don't get me wrong. He tried. I mean, you met him. Uncle Marty's not exactly the paternal type. Yeah, well, that's still no reason to kill him. Listen, Henry, a lot of people have had it a hell of a lot worse than your brother, and they turned out just fine. Don't blame yourself for what your brother did. Excuse me. Excuse me! I, um... I dropped my bag back... Can I... can I just... That's it right there. Oh, you are the man. I am so sorry. It won't happen again. Thank you. Let's head on over, take a look in there. Hey, guys. What's... what's going on? - You think we don't know? - Yeah. We saw you slip away when you heard the sheriff was searching rooms. Give it up, n. We know you have it. Have what? - Muffin. - Muffin? Don't play dumb. She's bloup doll, and I can't find her anywhere. I don't have Muffin, man. Can we go now? Wait a second. She's in your bag, isn't she? I told you, I don't have her. - Okay, show me. - Dude, you're an idiot. No, Sully, Sully! - Come on, man. - No! What? You've had this the whole time? Guys, I can... I can explain. Where's Booth? Okay, we're all set. I am so sorry for youross. Thank you. Your father's inside. Just take as long as you need. I'll go in with you. Abby... I'm sure I don't have to say this, but she shouldn't even peek under that sheet in there. Ready? I'm wondering if this is such a good idea. You don't have to do this. We can go. No... I want to try. Hi, Daddy. - Henry? Are you okay? - Yeah. I need everybody to clear these docks now! These fires may trigger another explosion! Dad, what happened? We don't know. Maybe a propane tank eloded. I want you to get home and stay there with your mother. You should get back to your house and stay there as well, Jimmy. - Sheriff. - Yeah, yeah. - Abby, go! - Okay. Everybody off these docks! I tried everything. I swear. Booth just bled out. It happened so fast. I'm sorry, I should have told you guys. You left him in the woods? I was afraid that if I told you guys, you'd never believe me. Why wouldn't we believe you, Malcolm? We're your friends. It was the money. If you guys thought Booth ran off with it, then... I could keep it. I know it sounds bad, but I was desperate and that cash... You let Booth die in the woods for money, man. - You kill him for money. - I did not kill him! Don't say that! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. You think sorry is going to bring him back? Come on. Look at him. When you come downstairs... we're going to the sheriff, tell him everything. And then we're going to get Booth. We're not leaving him here. I've known for a while that JD blamed most of his problems on me and Uncle Marty. I just didn't realize how much he hated us. Well, how could he blame you for your parents' death? I'm talking about after that. Did you know JD tried to kill himself? Yeah, I heard about that. Did you know there was a girl with him when he did it? It was this girl he went to high school with. They had a suicide pact. I just happened to come home from school when they decided to go for it. I found them together in his room. You saved them. I saved JD. She was already dead. After that, Uncle Marty and I checked JD into a psych facility. He was there for over a year. He never forgave us. Look, um, I don't know why you came today, but I'm really glad that you did. I did it because I care about you and Henry. Me and Henry. It's never going to be the same, is it? We should get going. Uh, would you mind taking Trish to the Candlewick? I have to stop at my dad's, get some things. I don't think you should. It's not safe. Your father would want you back at the hotel. I'll be careful. The house isn't far from here. Mom? Mom? Did you hear about the marina? There was an explosion. Mom? Hello? You and your mother okay? She's not here, Dad. Why? What's going on? Listen to me. I want you to lock all the doors and windows and stay inside until I get home. - Dad? - Stay inside. I'll find your mother. Mom? You used to work for my dad. Cole Harkin. I was one of his deputies. You were at the marina when Wakefield... I was the match he used to start the fire. Are-Are you looking for my dad? I'm here for you. Your father is chasing the wrong man. - JD Dunn is innocent. - How do you know that? Have you seen him? Do you know where he is? All you need to know is that your dad can't be trusted. He's a liar. My dad's kept this island safe for years. Ask him about the first time Wakefield came to the island. When Wakefield did this to me, he was coming back for revenge. - He was coming back for your dad. - You're lying. You don't believe me? Ask him. Ask your father. Mom? Mom? Mom. No, don't kill me! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! No, don't... Hey, you! So what happens after you catch JD? I'll call the state police and they'll come get him. I'm sorry, Henry. I can only imagine how hard this is for you. There he is! Hey, Sheriff, we got something! Let's go, come on, go. Henry, get back here. It's over, JD. You're going to look pretty stupid when I'm locked up and somebody else gets killed. - We got JD. - I need to talk to you. Are you lying about Wakefield? Wakefield? What are you asking? Is Mom dead because of you? Mom. Your old deputy Cole Harkin came to visit me today. He said the murders were all about you. Why was Wakefield after you? Why did he come to the island? It wasn't about me, Abby. Wakefield came here for your mom. Your mother knew Wakefield when she was younger, back in Seattle. What do you mean "knew him"? They dated. She was just a kid. I guess it got pretty bad. That's how she came to the island. Running away from him. He tracked your mom down. Tried to hurt her. I had to stop him. Wakefield... and Mom? It wasn't her fault, Abby. Dad... why are you sending me away? When are you going to talk to me? Tell me what I did. I'll apologize. Yeah, that will help. That will fix everything! It's your fault, you know. If you really loved her, you would have saved her. Mom would still be alive. Did you ever think maybe she got what she deserved? Abby? The first time Wakefield came to the island, he tried to hurt your mom, to take her away. I told my deputies to teach him a lesson, make sure he never came back. Cole Harkin. Cole was one of the men who followed my orders. Wakefield went after him, cut him pretty bad. I wanted to make sure he'd never hurt Sarah again. Instead of assault, I charged him with attempted murder of a police officer. I pulled every string I could. Put him away a long time. But I'm afraid that's what brought him back here seven years ago. You did it for Mom... but you should have told me. I wanted to protect her memory. Just thought it'd be easier to let you hate me. Where have you been? Richard's been missing all day, and then I couldn't find you. I went and saw Dad. I needed to say good-bye. And I've made a decisi. Calling off the wedding. Of course. We will go back home. You and Henry can pick a new date. It's going to take some time. No, Shea. I mean, I'm not marrying Henry. Ever? Every time I look at him, I see Daddy in that church. You don't have to make any decisions right now. I already have. Thanks for coming with me today. I've been thinking about a lot of things today... but... mostly about the day Wakefield came. There's nothing I can do to change what he did... but... I was the one who did the most damage. I allowed him to take everything. I chose to shut everyone out who loved me. You said... something today about you and Henry... about things never being the same. I... I found this at my dad's today. I thought you would like to have it. I remember this. I know it's not mine to decide, but... I've always believed you two belong together. I don't want you to make the same mistake I did. Your grandmother should be waiting when you get to the airport. You said that already. I know you don't want to go, but... I think it's bes for everybody. Best for who? For you? Don't talk like that. Please. Give me a call when you get to Los Angeles. Let me know you got there safely. I'll be fine. Abby! Your boat here? Seven years ago, I left without saying good-bye. I never called. Never wrote. Hey, that was a long time ago. The day that Wakefield killed my mom, he almost killed me, too. I was hiding by the side of the road. A truck stopped and distracted him. I was able to get away. It was your truck, Jimmy. You saved my life, and I never told you. I saw you hiding after I stopped. You knew? Why didn't you say anything? Guess I didn't want you to think that you owed me anything. But I... I owe you my life. You ever... ever think about what might have happened if I didn't leave? You mean between us? Probably would have done a hell of a lot of camping. I'm covered in fish. Daddy? Daddy?
