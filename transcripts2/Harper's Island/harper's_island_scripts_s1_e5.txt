I don't know, but I'm sure you'll ask him when he gets here. Careful. You are going to hurt yourself, young lady. Honey, it can't be her dog. She's always carrying it. I've never even seen it walk. Yeah, maybe it was just a rabbit. Or a wild Chihuahua. Trish. Honey. Oh, God. Are you okay? Take it easy,take it easy. Are you okay? What happened? I have no idea. Felt like a truck hit us. Easy. You have your cell phone? I don't know, it's... Okay. That's all right. All right, come on. Can you get up? Yeah, I think so. Hold on.All right. All right.Yep. Ankle's... ankle's not so good.

Do you like them? They're creepy. So are you. You're going to get in trouble. Nobody cares what I do. Me, neither. The other day, I nearly got killed, and... no one noticed. You think this will get you noticed? Only one way to find out. I could... I could use some help. Here. Hey, babe, it's me again. Hope you're enjoying your hour off. Closer to two now. Um, call me when you can. I'm dying here. Just kidding... kind of. Love you. Henry. Lay it on me. We have a question with table runners. Seashell or ecru? Uh... ecru. Ah... excellent. Thank you. Now, come with me, and we'll do napkin rings. I don't understand the point of napkin rings. Run! Booth! Hello? Booth? Dude. You take the shower first, and then you turn off the water. Do you knock, man? It was open. You want to snag some breakfast? Where's Booth? I haven't seen him. I can't believe he flaked last night. Voicevoice mail. Hey, Boothy. Where you hiding out, man? Muffin was asking about you all night. She was waiting for you at the bachelor party. Call me. Oh, and, uh, Henry wants to know why you hate him. He'll call. It was after junior year. We had permission to party on his yacht. And Wellington didn't mind a bunch of teenagers breaking into his galley and drinking all his liquor? Okay, no, we didn't drink all his liquor. And yeah, Henry had the okay from Trish. Then, why did Tom Wellington call and wake me up at 1:00 in the morning. Because Tom hated the fact that his daughter was banging Henry. You know, just like the fact that you Hated me when I was dating Abby. I didn't hate you. Dad, you put Jimmy in jail for an hour that night. Okay, I hated you a little bit. Finally, thank you. So it's my fault you two didn't like each other back then? - Oh, absolutely. - I guess. Oh...fair enough. So you're here for, what, another couple of days? Yeah, the wedding's tomorrow. Don't know if you have time, But I've got some things I've been keeping at the house Some of your mom's, some of yours. Thought maybe you'd like to look through them. Yeah, okay. Maybe this afternoon? We've got the wedding rehearsal. Let me check, see if there's time. Voice mail again. A lot of the island doesn't get reception. This isn't like Booth to just disappear. What if something happened? What, like he tripped over his own shovel? Or maybe somebody saw him burying the money. - Like who? - I don't know, But that was a lot of dough, a-and Booth... I'm just saying, guys, we don't know. Okay, well, maybe we should go and try and find him, You know,just in case. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we-we-we-we could split up and meet back later. What? It's me-- Madison. That was so cool with the firecrackers. Did you see Maggie's face? It looked like she wanted to go to the bathroom really bad. Yeah, sounds like we did our job. You want to blow up - Some more?  - Uh, can't. No, we used up all the firecrackers. Hey, I know. We could put a candy bar in the pool, so everyone thinks there's... Sorry, Madison, I'm kind of busy. How come grown-ups say they're busy when they're not doing anything? Sometimes we're, you know, busy on the inside, You know, just thinking about stuff. I think about stuff. I'm going to be flower girl tomorrow And I want to make sure I'm perfect. How come you're not in the wedding? 'Cause I didn't want to. Henry asked me, but I said no. But he's your brother. You have any brothers or sisters? Uh-uh. Then you wouldn't understand. ? Just because you're related to someone doesn't mean You have to like them. I understand. It's like when Grandpa smiles at my dad. Well, I was hoping we could get More time together, But this isn't exactly what I had in mind. - Honey.  -What? Sorry, I'm just thinking about Henry. You look worried. Dad, He doesn't know the difference Between a Leonidas rose and a calla lily. Maggie's probably eating him alive. Not much of a meal. I thought we were past this. Past what? You not liking the man I'm marrying tomorrow. I like Henry. He's ambitious, works hard, loves you, he's... Just from the wrong side of the marina. That has nothing to do with anything. ? Then what is it? Really. I don't trust the boy. Gut instinct. So you trust your own intestines more than your daughter? My instincts have gotten me where I am today. Yeah, well, your instincts suck, Dad. ? You married Katherine. I thought we were past that. She's cheating on you. With Richard. Sorry. Abby. Abby, you like Cal, right? ? Do you mind sitting next to him at the reception? Yes, these are the same clothes I wore last night, And no, I am not doing the walk of shame. I didn't even notice. ? Guess who I just had breakfast with. - Who?  - My dad. You called him, - H-he called you? - I kind of tagged along. Turns out he's pretty good friends with Jimmy. I thought he hated Jimmy. I thought he hated most people. He asked me to come over this afternoon, pick up some stuff. ? So you forgive him? I told him I might be busy. Why? You think I should go? Henry. You can stay here and choose salad forks with me. ? Oh, um... I'd love to sit with Cal at the reception. Oh, we may have a bit of a situation. The napkins don't fit the napkin rings? I haven't been able to get ahold of Reverend Fain. Are we concerned? We just need to know what time the rehearsal will end so we can time dinner. Oh, okay. I'll walk down to the church and take care of it. Okay, Trish, I get why you were having a panic attack this morning ? And why you're taking your sweet time coming back. Just don't take too long. I miss your face. Reverend Fain? Hello? Daddy... say something. I feel like a clich? The widower on the rebound who marries the beautiful young woman. The classic cuckold. Pathetic. You're not pathetic. You loved her. ? My relationship with Katherine was more complicated than just love. What? You never said that... Trish, I... Dad. Hey, there. Sir. Can we use your phone? Why is he just standing there? I have no idea. Hey, hey, can we get a phone? What the hell? Oh, my God. Daddy, Daddy. No, no, this way, this way. Get in here. No! Aah! It's okay. Looks like the reverend hasn't been In his office for a couple days. The mail's all stacked up. He's got over 20 messages on his phone. Well, go and check his home and then give me a call. Yeah, you got it. Something happen to Reverend Fain? If you're asking me If I think something bad happened to him, I don't know yet. Right now, we got to get this carcass cleaned up So you can have your wedding rehearsal. Great. Without the reverend, it's gonna be tough to have a rehearsal. Hey, Boothy. Just wanted to... Pay my respects,tell you how sorry I am. I kind of feel like this is my fault, you know. I only followed you 'cause I was going to try And convince you to keep the money, but this... I am so sorry. I-I can't tell the guys Because they'd think I shot you instead of what really happened. But I want you to know that I'm going to give your share of the cash to your mom, And I'm not going to let anybody blame you for anything. You're my best friend. Dad? Is this how you imagined you'd be spending Your last days as a bachelor? What, you mean cleaning up a mess before my fiancee finds it? Yes. Oh, it's probably Maggie Krell putting out an APB on me. I don't doubt it,the woman's half pitbull. This is Sheriff Mills. Please leave a message. Hi, Dad, um, changed my mind about coming over. Going to let myself in. Bye. We'll get this cleaned up and get a couple of fans in here. Hey, do you think this is just some sick prank? I don't know. It's pretty damn twisted. Candlewick Something like this happened to me At the Candlewick a few days ago. Someone put a deer head in our bungalow. And you didn't think it was worth calling me about? I took care of it. I'm pretty sure it was Shane. Was this before or after he grabbed your brother? Before. Why, do you think Shane could have done this? No, no, I still got him locked up at the station. Thought I'd keep him quarantined till after the wedding. Consider it my gift to you and Trish. Thanks. How is your brother? He's changed so much since your parents died. Yeah, it's been hard on both of us, maybe more so on JD. Yeah, I don't think him coming back to the island was such a good idea. Well, all the same, I want to thank you for getting married here. ? It'd been Seven years since I'd seen her. I was beginning to think she'd never come home. It just takes time. Yeah. Abby has a lot of bad memories. Some of them involve you. Let me get that box. You think it's gone? Stay here. Daddy! Daddy. Are you okay? I got your message. ? I didn't think you'd be able to make it. Oh, I just had some me. Well, did you find anything? I kept most of your mom's jewelry. Yeah?Um, I didn't see that. Maybe I could come back later and look. I can make coffee. I need to get going. All right. Glad you could stop by. I, I may not get to see you again before you leave. I'm not telling you to come back or not to. I just...I want to tell you I'm sorry for everything that happened before you left, for what I said. Hope you'll come back. I should have known better than to go over there But he seemed all sweet this morning Talking with you, and I thought maybe I should give my dad another chance. You... you should see what he has in the attic-- articles, police reports...awful photographs. Did, did you know about this? That he's still obsessing over Wakefield? No. I mean... it comes up sometimes, Abby, you know, how he misses you or your mom. But it wasn't just old stuff. There were articles about other murders... The new ones...in Seattle, Portland, all over. He's obsessing over murders when Wakefield's already dead. Maybe it's just how he copes, Abby. No. It feels like more than that. Like he's still chasing Wakefield. I don't think we should clean up before the rehearsal, do you? No. We'll just tell 'em some lunatic in the woods had his dog attack us. Honey, when we get back, I don't want you to say anything about Katherine and Richard. What about Shea? She's a big part of this. We will tell her after the wedding when we get back to Seattle, when we can do something about it. The important thing is you getting married to Henry. I love you. Hey, guys.I got nothing; how about you? No, I asked around at the dock. Nobody remembers seeing him. I'm just going to say it. Don't get pissed. But what if Booth took the money? - No way. - It's $250,000. And I said there's no way that Booth would do that to us. Look,I'd rather believe that than the other thing. What other thing? What if something bad happened? I mean,for real,what if Whoever made that mess on the boat found Booth? ?... What if Booth's...? Dead? ? You... you think he might be dead? I'm just saying we don't know. Maybe we call the sheriff. And tell him what? And tell him that we found a dead guy's body on a boat and we stole his money? I don't think so. Look, maybe I was wrong before. ? You know, m-maybe he chartered a boat and went back to the mainland. And went where? It's not like we don't know where he lives. With his mom. What about Henry? He's part of this. Oh, yeah,let's drag Henry into this the day before he gets married. you're right, you're right. All right, let's play it cool for now. Just tell them That Booth is chilling back at his mom's. Yeah... at his mom's. Go. Are you okay? I've been calling all day. Yeah, well,we had an accident, but... What, an accident? Is your dad okay? Oh, yeah, he's, he's fine. Um, I'm actually really glad we went. Honey... What is that smell? I think it's raccoon. I'll tell you all about it. I don't think I was a very good representative - for you today. - No? Napkin rings are complicated. The details aren't that important. I'm sure you did great. Come on. Yeah, Patrick, what is it? You're sure it's a hearing aid? Yeah, I know the reverend wore one. Just stay put. I'm on my way. Come on in. Hey, have you seen my brother? No, I haven't seen him since... I guess the boat ride over. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah,just a weird day. Hey, is Madison here? Do you mind if I ask her? Sure, I'm sure she'd like the company. - In the bedroom? - Mm-hmm. That's a pretty dress. - Is that your flower girl dress for tomorrow? - Yeah. You going to wear it to the rehearsal this afternoon? No, Mom says I can't. It's too special. You know, I'm sorry we don't have any other kids for you to play with. It's okay, I have a friend. JD? Actually, I have lots of friends. Oh, okay, 'cause, you know, I saw you and JD throwing firecrackers this morning. I thought it was pretty funny. Doesn't sound funny. Listen, I just want to know if you went down to the church with JD. I haven't seen him all day. All right, well, I guess he exploded all those firecrackers without you then. He wouldn't. Madison. Where's JD? I got your message at the church. What message? We're done. I don't want to see you again. Hey, Henry. I've got one more surprise for you. I think you're really going to like it. It was in the dirt. I only spotted it 'cause I had to take a leak. Remind me again why I hired you. My uncle Ned was best man at your wedding. The reverend's house is back there, but the tracks lead in the opposite direction. Call me a romantic, But this makes me wish we'd done a big church wedding. Dude, everything's going to be fine. Yeah, I know, but what are we going to say about Booth? I don't know, like, family emergency or something? Henry, uh, I need to tell you something. What's up? I never had sex with Trish. I know. I just want to make sure. Because back in the day when you guys were broken up... I tried a couple times,and... she rejected me flat out. ? She told me. Well, you are marrying one hell of a woman. I'll tell you that. I am truly and sincerely happy for you, man. Look at you two, eyeing each other all sexy-sexy. I hope I find somebody to feel that way about. Oh, you will. What are you thinking? You ever wonder how one short walk can change everything? Yeah, it's like we become different people. Trish Wellington Dunn. Good afternoon,everybody. As some of you may know, Reverend Fain can't be here today, so I will be conducting the rehearsal. First off, let's all move up to the front of the church. - Great, you made it. - Yeah. Did you get a ride? Uh, Jimmy brought me. Really? You know you could have invited him in, right? Yeah, but I'm here for you. Where's Joel Booth? He had to leave. Yeah, family emergency. Not sure when he'll be back. ? Lucy Daramour and... Chloe Carter. Lucy will be here tomorrow and I have no idea where Chloe is. Probably torturing Cal somewhere. At this rate, we could have eloped. Awful. I'm going to be here tomorrow, and for the record, all of this hassle - completely worth it. My wedding day was the happiest day of my life. We're not them. Catfish line? Your lips to God's ear. All right. And... okay. I wish you forever happiness And Abby, this is when you'll do your reading. And then you will exchange your vows and say... I do. I do, too. And now Mr. Wellington will come up and light the unity candle. Come on, angel. It's Reverend Fain. Hi, this is Abby. Leave a message after the beep. ? Can, uh,someone get the lights? Oh, I... I got it.
