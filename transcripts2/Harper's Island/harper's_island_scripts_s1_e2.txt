 Henry treats his guests to a scavenger hunt on the island. Sully tricks Cal into switching teams so he can flirt with his fianc√©e, but tires of her and leaves Cal hanging in a hunter's snare.

The deer later turns up in Henry's room, which he manages to clean before Trish arrives. Trish catches her father talking to Hunter, whom she refused to dump Henry for, but believes their cover story and Henry hangs around the wedding party's campfire, a wanderer-off falls into a hunter's pit and is burned alive. Reverend Fain is caught in another snare and decapitated. The morning after Kelly celebrates being promised she can stay with Abi in LA wildly in bed with J.D., she's found hanged in her room.

 But I can't help but feel... there's more to come. Abby Mills. Hi, Jimmy. Welcome home. It's just a visit. Don't go back to that, man... she dumped you. She didn't even give you a kiss goodbye in the Rearview Mirror. That wasn't about me. JD, you in there? I'm glad you came... mom and dad gone, you and Uncle Marty are the only family I have. Hello, Trish. Hunter, what are you doing here? I'm getting married. Are you sure?

 If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask. My daughter is not marrying Henry Dunn. I was put on this Earth to protect men like Henry from men like you. Do you mind? I like your tat. Broken hearts. Is he bothering you? That's enough, Shane! I wasn't sure you'd come. What do you want from me, Hunter? I already told you. I want another chance. Well, then, you're wasting your time. I mean, what, did you really expect me to get all swoony just because you showed up? No, but I thought you might at least... What, still care? Look... Hunter, you had your chance, okay? Three years ago, I was yours. Now I want you to go. Yeah, and what if I won't, Trish? Look, we don't want a repeat of what happened in college. I'm not worried about Henry. Shh. This will only take a second. What the hell are you doing? Oh, I think you broke it. Well, it serves you right, grabbing me like that. And when did you start hunting deer? Abby... they're taking over the island. If we don't cull the weak ones, they'll starve in the winter. So, you're doing it for them, are you? Lucky them. It's a little bit more complicated than that. Don't apologize to her. Who the hell are you to tell us what to do? Shane, come on, man. She left you once, man. She'll do it again. Abby, Abby, Abby, hey, come on. We're doing good, Abby. You know, the deer can't migrate off the island, and we've been culling them for years. I'm not judging you, Jimmy. All right. Do as you like: hunt, fish, kill. I don't care... it's just, I don't need to see any more blood on this island. What time did you close up yesterday? We're done forthe sea but I was here till about 4:00. Wasn't broke when I left. And just one item missing? Just the head spade, as far as I can tell. Haven't done a full inventory or anything. Anything else goes missing, give me a shout, okay? Yeah. We should be taking home the limit. I got to keep apologizing for this? What, is it Abby's fault you can't hit a moving target? I don't tell her how to do whatever the hell it is she does down in L.A. Shane, she's a writer. Oh, really? You a big fan? All I'm saying is, she runs right into the middle of our hunt, gets all self-righteous, and all you can do is smile and "aw shucks" and apologize to her. I cannot believe how I surprised her. The whole hand over the mouth move. Not my finest moment. You're pathetic, man. Listen, Abby is not your problem. Hey, JD, you here? JD? Is that you, Henry? Hey, you dressed? Uh, no, I'm not. Can I catch you later, bro? Have you seen Uncle Marty this morning? Nope. Haven't been out. Listen, um... I was wondering if maybe you could, uh... Stay out of trouble? Not ruin your wedding? Yeah, pretty much. Shane started the fight. Look, Shane's a jerk... that's not exactly news...  but we're not locals anymore. Well, we were never locals. We were summer guys. No, they tolerated you because you hung out with Abby, and they've always hated me. Look, they don't hate you. Like I care. You're the one with this twisted need to be liked by everyone. Look, I just want this week to go well. All right, well, good luck with that. Hi. There she is. I think you all remember my lovely, but late bride-to-be. My apologies. A bride's work is never done. How much did I miss? Just most of it. Uh, where was I? Okay. Four places you'll need to visit on the scavenger hunt: The Cannery... Groomsmen, it's an open bar. Be kind. Chloe... From the cannery, we'll head on down to the Eastern Bluff, and then on to the church that we are going to get married in. And, um... the Maritime Museum, where Trish used to work. Thank you. Now, in each location, you'll have a task to complete. Have fun. Make new friends. We'll see you back this afternoon. Hey, Cal. Sully. Ow. Hey, man. I guess there was some kind of mix-up. I'm supposed to be on the yellow team. Weird, right? Oh... yeah, of course. Yeah. Great, um... I don't care what anybody says about you. You're okay. Thanks? Sadness... I thought we'd be on the same team. What? We're not? You look dashing in turquoise. Ow. Ah, Chloe. Hey. I love that. Come on. We're going to kick their ass. Yeah. Hi. Hey. I thought God loved all creatures. Just because he loves them doesn't mean he won't smack them from time to time. Besides, we don'want the spiders jumping down on the bride and groom, do we? No. Is that for me? Only if you're expecting the props for the scenger hunt. The groups are on their way. They're supposed to take a photo of themselves on the altar with either this top hat or the bridal veil. Ah... I thought I smelled scones. So don't forget, the rehearsal is on Friday. I've lost my hearing, not my mind. See you later. Look... I'm sorry, baby, okay? I had an important wedding errand to run. And you had to do it today? Yeah, I did. Hmm. All right, it's just been a weird morning. You weren't here and Uncle Marty still hasn't shown up. Well, come on. You can help me with something. What? Let's go. Taste... that. Somebody, help me! What color is Trish's bicycle? Is it pink? No. The correct answer is black. Black, black. Damn, the are hard. Okay. Is every question about Trish and Henry? Mm-hmm, that's the game. Hey, Nikki, who is that? That's Kelly Seaver. That's Kelly? Yeah, changed a little bit since high school, huh? Uh... people eat here. Gigi is people. Gigi is going to be an appetizer if you don't get her off my bar. We wanted some fresh air anyway. We'll be outside. Hey, Lucy, wait up. I know you probably don't remember me. You're Kelly. Franklin, Hollywood, Sunset, Santa Monica, Melrose, Beverly, Olympic, Pico... Okay, I've lived there for seven years and I can't do that. I have a map. And I knew you were in Los Angeles. It seems like the perfect place. It's okay. Rent's expensive and traffic is bad... But that must be totally worth it because no one would know what happened to you. I've always wondered if I would be different if I could live in a place... Where people don't look at you and think... "there go those girls whose moms were strung up by John Wakefield." Do you have people you can talk to here? You know, family? I'm so envious of you. You got out of here. You did it. Actually, my dad sent me away. I think I scared him. I think I scare a lot of people. Not me. But I do have to use the ladies' room. I see him. See who? Wakefield. I see John Wakefield, except not in my dreams- awake, for real, like he's back. Kelly, my dad killed John Wakefield. He's dead. Then how come I keep seeing him? Aw, John Wakefield murdered my mommy. Wah-wah, boo-hoo. Get out! I get a pee! It's my fault. I used to go out with Shane. He can be... No, it's, it's o... it's okay, but what you said in there about Wakefield... You don't have to worry. Oh, I should let you get back to your friends. Bye. Yay, I did it, I got one right. You're welcome, there's no need to thank me. But now I'm finished. I want my Chloe. I want to be yellow again. Oh, uh, Sully swapped bandanas with Cal. I think he's feeling a little... Stupid. I've been played and I feel stupid. Don't just whine about it. Why don't you go fight for Chloe? Look, we're here. Now, I think the yellow team started out going to the museum, so they're probably headed over here to the Eastern Bluff. Well, the island's not that big. There's a path there. You could probably meet up with them. What do you have to lose? You're right. I'm on it. Go get her. Maybe I should go with him, make sure he's okay. Um, yeah, I'll meet up with you later. Hey. Hey. Um... I want to apologize. No. No, I shouldn't have grabbed you like that. It was very high school of me. If it makes you feel any better, we only got one deer all morning. I... I don't hate hearing that. Little early to be drinking, huh? Or were you waiting for me? Maybe hoping to play a little game of pool? No. Oh, okay. We're on a scavenger hunt. Yeah, Kelly Seaver was in there. I hardly recognized her. Yeah. She never really got over what Wakefield did to her mom. Dude, what are you doing? I can't even leave you alone long enough to go to the can. Shane. You ask her about the writing on the windshield? What? Nothing. You know she had nothing to do with it. Yeah, I know who did and he'll get his. What are you guys talking about? It's nothing. Leave Jimmy alone, okay? You didn't see him after you left. It was awful, okay? Everything about him was just puppy dog awful. Sir Weeps-a-lot, you coming? I was fine. What the hell are we doing here? I know this scavenger hunt's kind of lame, but at least there's an open bar at the Cannery. Talk to Chloe. I mean, she's the one that asked the museum dude where Wakefield was buried. Yeah, but you're the dude who followed her here. I found it. Two to one, she's waiting for you with one of those whaling thingies. Make us proud. The guy at the museum told me they wouldn't bury him on consecrated land. This really excites you, doesn't it? He killed six people. Taking someone's life... I don't know, I just... Like every moment could be your last. You're sweet. No, I miss you, too. Oh, some scavenger hunt thing. My team totally bailed. Yeah, I'm going to feed Gigi and take a long, hot bath. Hang on a sec? Uh-huh, yeah. Yeah, okay. Me, too. Ryan, sweetie, I, I got to go. Okay. Bye. So... Hunter's here. What? On, on the island, yeah Why? Trish, honey, you are not thinking about... What? No. Lucy, I didn't invite him here. He just showed up. Well, that's just like him. Never there for you and then shows up at the worst possible time. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Shea thinks I should tell my dad, which is the worst possible idea... I'm not trying to judge you or anything because I was there in college, too, and I dated my fair share of creeps, and that is why I know Hunter Jennings is a bad guy. That's why you dumped him and went back to Henry. It's why I'm with Ryan. Because we have good guys now. You're right. And you need to talk to your dad. I know. Hey. I called your name. I guess you didn't hear. Oh, sorry, I... I was... I just...  I wanted to thank you for today. I've wanted to talk to you for so long. I've had so many conversations in my head. Well... I'm going to be here for the rest of the week. You know, you don't have to live here if you don't like it. Could I come stay with you? I... I mean, I've always wanted to go to L.A. I... I'm sorry. That was, that was stupid. N... n... no, it's fine. It... it's just I live in a studio with a cat and... I never asked, okay, it was just a stupid conversation in my head. Hey, JD. You are so busted. Hey. Um... I was just... Skipping out on the scavenger hunt? No, I, um, I finished it. The whole thing? Yeah. I won. Yeah, and I answered all the questions. Way too easy. Really? So the whole team quit or just you? The whole team. I knewt, damn it. No, it was fun, and then Shane showed up. He give you guys a hard time? Oh, you know, just Shane being Shane. Permission to come aboard. Nice. This is yours? Yeah, I finally ponied up. Got it last spring. I'm jealous. I hear you're doing just fine. I'm doing okay. Oh, you mean the wedding? Let's just say not every deckhand ends up marrying a princess, huh? Hey, listen, um, I want to come down here and just make sure we're still cool. Sure, why wouldn't we be? I know my brother and Shane got into it last night. Okay, that's been going on since we were kids. Come on, that's never affected you and me. Eh, still... I had a talk with JD earlier. I asked him to cool it until after the wedding. If you're king me to talk to Shane, that's not going to change anything. It's just the way he is. Come on, you worked with him. You know how he is. Yeah. Uh... so listen, we're having a party tonight. Oh, yeah? Yeah, bonfire down at Harmon Beach. Should be fun. If you and Shane want to come by, hang out, we're gonna have a lot of food, cold beer. I don't know. Tonight's going to be tough. Okay. Just wanted to invite you for old times sake. Appreciate it. Abby'll be there. Like I said, I don't know. Bollocks. Somebody help me! Trish! Trish. Trish? Why'd I go to the considerable expense of bringing you here if you can't do your job? Well, it's not as if Trish and I ended up on the best of terms. I just need more time. There is no time... my daughter's wedding is in four days. Dad? Yep, still upside down. And all alone. And terribly out of shape. Hello? Somebody help me! Yes! Cal, what the hell are you doing? Oh, thank God you're here. Oh, my goodness, please get me down. My head is about to explode. Please. You know, I got tired of hearing your gal pal pine for this Wakefield guy, so I split. Guess I made a wrong turn. You know how to get back to the hotel from here? Yep. I'm pretty sure once I get back on my feet, I'll be able to guide us back with the help of my map. There she is. Perfect. Can you please just get me down? You know, I'm thinking this is more of like a two-man job. I'm gonna go and get some help. Don't worry, I'll be back. No, Sully. Sully, don't go. No, please. You hang in there, buddy. No, Sully, please! Dude. Dude. You bastard! Sweetheart. I sent Hunter away. He won't be back. Please forgive me. I... I was trying to protect you. I can only imagine how it felt to see Hunter after all these years. You said we were getting married in four days. That's right. Hunter came to me for help, said that he was still in love with you, and I told him to go, that you were marrying Henry in four days. That is what you wanted me to do, isn't it? Thank you. Anything for my baby. Anything. Hello? Abby? Hey. Everything okay? Uh... yeah. No. Someone put a deer head in our tub. What? Can you imagine if Trish would have come back and found this instead of me? Uh, listen, I need to finish cleaning this up before she gets back. Jimmy and Shane were hunting deer this morning. Son of a bitch. JD was right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, Henry. Hang on, let me talk to them. The last think you need is a fight with those guys. No, the last thing I need is a deer head in my bathtub. No, please, please, let me help. Take care of that before Trish sees it. I'll go talk to Jimmy. A deer head? Yeah, I... I know Shane and JD can't stand each other, but... I don't think Henry should get dragged into it. Not during his wedding week. When Shane and I finished hunting this morning, someone had written "psycho" in blood on his truck's windshield. And that makes it okay for Shane to put a deer head in Henry's bathtub. Of course not... I'm just saying it's always been kind of complicated with those guys. Look, when Henry came and saw me earlier, I didn't know anything about a deer. I'll talk to Shane about cooling it. Thank you. Yeah. This is not the way I wanted it to be at all. I mean, most days, this island is pretty great. Almost like it used to be. I want to believe that. Yeah. The only thing missing is you. I got to admit, when I heard you were coming back, I got pretty excited. I mean, we all did. Your dad, Nikki, even Kelly. Look, I know you're here for Henry, but if you could just give the rest of us another chance. Hey. Hi. About what you said earlier... Oh, no worries.Total take-back. No, it's fine. You can stay with me in L.A. Really? Yeah, you know, uh... Um, until you find a place of your own. Uh, I know, I know... boundaries. This is an awesome day. You are awesome. Oh, my God. Okay. I'll see you later. See you. I'm going to L.A. I'm going to L.A. I'm going to L.A. I'm going to L.A. This is the best day ever. And I am not going to let you forget it. *All my chains, all my chains* *All my chains* *would break aside* Right back at you. *There was no transfer* *I could borrow* *There was no place here* *To unfold* *There was no pill* *That I could swallow...* Kelly. Yo, Kelly girl. Hey. It's your best friend, Nikki. Open up. Kelly-Kelly-bo-belly. The bonfire started an hour ago. Let's go. Kelly? Danny, look. Danny, I'm juggling. I did it. Hey, Uncle Marty. Uncle Marty. "Found a wild one." Wow. "See you at wedding." Yo, Henry. Thanks for the invite. I know what you did. I have no i... Come on. Gigi? Gigi. Gigi? Gigi! Cal? Has anyone seen my cute little Englishman? Oh, man. Cal? Cal. Can someone please explain to me why anyone outside a Roadrunner cartoon would build traps like these? I've heard about pit traps and snares on the island, but never seen one. They're probably made by some old-time hunter. Gigi. Gigi. Gigi, where are you, girl? All right, I'm telling you, it's around here. Gigi! Cal? Cal. Sweetheart. Why are you upside down? Hello? Is there someone up there? Help! No! No! It's happened here before, and it's happening again. Getting picked off one by one. There's another body, Dad. Hanging in a tree. Sound familiar? Why now? Look, I need your help. You ever wonder how one short walk can change everything? Danny, what are you doing? I think we could use a prayer. I'm not going to get to be a flower girl, Abby. Who told you that? The spirits told me. Who's doing this to us? I don't know. It has to be Wakefield. Or a copycat. There's something you need to see. Oh, my God! What is it? How many hours till sunrise? Too many. I'm scared. Me, too. Whoever's doing this wants me. Well, they can't have you. Why in God's name would you want to get married here? Well, believe me, I'm having second thoughts.
