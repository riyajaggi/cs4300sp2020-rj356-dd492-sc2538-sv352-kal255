 My name is Abby Mills, and I've come home to Harper's Island. My best friend is getting married to the girl of his dreams. But not everything about this trip is a celebration. Seven years ago, I left this place after John Wakefield murdered six people. My mother was one of them. Everyone else has moved on... believes the killings are in the past. But I can't help feel... ... there's more to come.

 Previously on Harper's Island... Hunter's here on the island. Hunter Jennings is a bad guy. We have good guys now. Why did I go to the considerable expense of bringing you here if you can't do your job? - Please get me down. - I'm gonna go and get some help. - Don't worry, I'll be back. - No, please! I know you probably don't remember me. You're Kelly. Could I live in a place... Without people thinking... "There go those girls "whose moms were strung up by John Wakefield."

 My dad killed John Wakefield. Then, how come I keep seeing him? You can stay with me in L.A. This is the best... day ever. Hey Beth. Come on in. If you say so. Incoming! How do you do it, Richard? I beg your pardon. How do you not scream out loud? The velvet straight jacket of becoming a Wellington. Henry, I make... excellent money. Shea is happy, and Madison will always be taken care of. What about you? What about your happiness? Well, you just... find a way. Pull! Way to go, Daddy. Anyone ever beat your dad? At skeet shooting? Not that I can remember. Are you gonna dethrone the king? Pull. Damn it. It's all right. Four out of five... not bad. You're up, Henry. Go get 'em. That's not like you, my love. Madison, what are you doing? I'm practicing to be a flower girl. Those aren't our flowers. Let her have some fun... it's not as if she has anyone to play with. Thank you. - Everything okay? - Yes. You have written your toast for tonight, right? To thank Daddy. Enough stalling, Henry. Show us what you've got. Yes, Henry. Enough stalling. Show him what you've got. Come on, babe. Pull. Pull! Pull! It's all right, babe. One more, and you could tie Daddy. Yeah, let's see what you're made of. Do you have what it takes to be a Wellington? Pull. Congratulations. Thank you, Katherine. Too bad. Maybe next time. You... did... great. I have never understood suicide. I delivered Kelly. Always hate to see them go while I'm still here. Maybe I'm too old for this world, but why would this little girl go and put that on her body after what Wakefield did to her mother? I'd like you to confirm that Kelly did, in fact, die from hanging. Why? You have reason to suspect otherwise? Just doing my job. Call me if you find anything else. I'll do my best, but I haven't done a postmortem in over sev... Sheriff... you should look at this. Harper's Island Season 1 Episode 03 "Ka-Blam" Subtitles: A?S Team / One By One Team --==All-about-Subs.fr==-- Normal? Natural? Maybe. You're always gonna get some petechial hemorrhaging with hanging, but... I'd call this excessive. There's also skin under her nails and evidence that she had sex yesterday. It's viscous, like blood, but... I don't know. I want you to be real thorough. See if you can tell whether the sex was consensual or whether she was fighting someone off. Well, that's a nasty thought. But I guess a man in your position has gotta think it. To the hottest groomsmen. You grew up on an island. - How can you not swim? - I can swim. I just wouldn't win any races. What about you, Beth? Reversal! Looks like Cal is still recovering. I'm surprised to see them out at all this morning. They were at each other all night. - He was pissed at her? - No, Urkel. Going at it. Like howler monkeys. I'm amazed anybody in the hotel got any sleep. I heard them, too. What's a... boozzle-wozzle? I don't get it. He's a nice guy, Sully. Sometimes, that's enough. Hey, man... Sorry again about leaving you hanging. That was totally my bad. Owe you a beer, okay? Is he apologizing or working Chloe? Knowing Sully, probably both. Man's a multitasker. Not me. My plan for the day is to spa, spa and spa. All right. Can I talk to you? Hey, handsome. You did great today. Come on. You're not still mad about losing to my dad? Then what? You'd choose me, right? What? If you had to choose between me and your dad. Or me and... anybody. You didn't hear? In three days, you... and me... together forever. Just checking. I have to go into town. - I'll see you later? - Yeah, sure. Gotta figure out this toast. Have fun. I'm here about Kelly Seaver. I didn't want you to hear it from... someone else. Hear what? Dad? Nikki Bolton found her last night. What... You're saying Kelly's... She's dead. Abby, I'm sorry. How did it... I mean, what happened? It appears that she... she took her own life. That doesn't make sense. I saw her yesterday. She was happy. Doc Campbell told me that she has a history. Has been on a lot of meds. Swings can occur in a couple of hours. How'd she do it? - It doesn't matter. - Dad, tell me. She hanged herself. Is that why you're here? Because Kelly killed herself - like Wakefield killed... - I don't want you to think about him. Of John Wakefield? You can say his name, Dad. Fine. John Wakefield had nothing to do with Kelly's death. Can you think of anyone else who might have seen or talked to her yesterday? Nothing comes to mind. How does it look, Miss? I don't know, part of me thinks I should wear white on my wedding night. I'm sorry, I said white. Yeah, but I wanna see you in this. What are you do...? No, get out of here. Come on. No, get out. Let me look at you. - Stop it. - You used to like this game. God. What, did you really think going to my father was gonna change my mind? - What are you talking about? - Yesterday. He told me everything... that you asked for his help. - And what else did he say? - That he said no, okay? And that he told you to leave. I realized that if I didn't come see you... ... then I would regret that for the rest of my life. Well, you've seen me. Now go. Well, the problem is... ... now that I've seen you, I'm convinced... I'm so sorry. Here's... Well, I gotta say, you two are gonna make a gorgeous couple. It's Abby. Can I talk to you for a minute? Tell Henry it's my morning off. No plans to burn or maim anyone. I'm not here for your brother. Just open the door. I just got some bad news. I thought you should know. Kelly's dead. That's weird. My dad thinks Kelly killed herself. I'm not so sure. Is that why you're here? You figure the freak must have killed her? I just wanna understand what happened to her last night. Not much to tell. We hooked up, we had a good time. When you told her that she could crash with you in L.A., she got all bouncy happy, I mean, not like someone looking to end it. Did she say anything a... about John Wakefield? She didn't have to. I saw her body. The tattoos. He was all over her. I know what you say to Thomas behind my back. That I'm weak. That I'm a coward. Take off your blouse. I said take it off. Now, get down on your knees. Now you are going to do... ... exactly as I say. I've been very bad. - It's spectacular. - Really? Henry's gonna lose it seeing you in this. - It's perfect. - Is it nice? - My gosh, let me see the back. - The silk is amazing. Yes, it's come together beautifully in the back. Mom would be so proud. Oh my God, why is he calling you? - You didn't invite him, did you? - Of course not. You said he was leaving. Wait, he's here on the island? - Henry knows? - No! And I forbid you to tell him, Beth. I'm taking care of the Hunter situation. The way you did in college? That's not fair. What happened in college? Let's just say that Trish's mouth said go away, but her body said... That was different. I love Henry, and I am marrying him in this dress in three days. How on earth did you land her? I graduated from Cambridge. I'm a medical doctor, an expert philatelist. I think it's the accent. I wake up every day praying she doesn't meet a cooler British. Or any other British person. That's fine. I know for a fact he isn't British. Isn't that the guy that left you hanging in the woods all day? He apologized, though. Hey, Ruth. Thanks for the call about Hunter Jennings. Not a problem. Though I was a little surprised you asked me to keep an eye out. - Too many guests at the Candlewick? - Something like that. He's a popular guy. Yeah, he's a... he's a friend of the family. - I don't think he's here right now. - That's okay. I just wanna leave him a little welcome gift. Just bring it right back. Number four. Thanks. {\*ITINERARY FOR HUNTER JENNINGS BILL TO: THOMAS WELLINGTON} You've done this before? It's fantastic. It's mostly honey, but they put these herbs in it. Clears your pores and makes your skin very touchable. I like touchable. Tastes pretty good, too. Why aren't you doing it? Because I'm already touchable. Well, maybe when we're finished, you and I can compare. I'll be back in about ten minutes. So I gotta ask... this... English guy... you know, he seems decent enough. But really, what... what's he got that I don't got? A pillow. What? Well-played, my love. You are dead! Come here, you English piece of crap! Looks like Pooh Bear got in the honey pot. I wouldn't mind a more recent picture, if you've got one. I need to talk to you. Okay by me. I don't think Kelly killed herself. Really? Is that what JD Dunn said to you? Maggie Krell saw him leave the Candlewick with Kelly. Why are you questioning Maggie if you think Kelly committed suicide? I don't have to explain my methods. Because you're so open and honest about everything else. Abby, I don't wanna do this. I am doing the best... The only deaths we have had on this island in the last seven years have been from illness or old age. Kelly is a tragedy, no matter how she died. I'm just trying to do right by her. I heard Shane was giving her grief about Wakefield yesterday. Yeah. But... since you're not investigating anything, there's no real reason to go talk to him, is there? Bye, Dad. Sheriff. I reckon you've heard. Can't believe she really did it. I mean, she used to talk sometimes, but... I never thought that... People say you saw Kelly at The Cannery yesterday, gave her a pretty good scare. I feel pretty bad about that. And not that it's any of your business, but Kelly and I broke up a while back. It was at a party at Harmon Beach. Ask around, man. I'm in with the Swells now. Well, congratulations on that. You see JD Dunn today? Then again, we ain't real tight, you know. You take care. You hear that? Sheriff thinks you killed Kelly. You know what? I think he's right. I'm sorry, it's just... I'm just really pissed at her. So you think she really did it, Nikki. I'll tell you who did it. It was that bastard John Wakefield. He's dead. You and I know that. I'm just telling you what Kelly believed. She saw Wakefield in every shadow. She'd call me at 3:00 in the morning, convinced that he'd been in her room. You know, I hate to say it, but... maybe she killed herself so he couldn't. I'm sorry, Abby. I didn't mean to talk so much about Wakefield. That's okay. What if it wasn't all in her head? What if someone really was stalking her? Who? Shane? He was pretty pissed when she broke up with him. Angry enough to hurt her? Yeah, he got really rough with her. You know, I'd find her, like, crying and... covering up her bruises with makeup. You know, I told her to talk to your dad, to get a restraining order, but she wouldn't listen to me, you know. Said it would make things worse. Now I don't know what to think. It's open. You lied to Trish. She saw us together. I had no choice. What if I can still get Trish to leave with me? That deal's off the table. All right, well, here's a new deal for you. I'll leave tonight, alone, but it's gonna cost you 50 grand. Or I can tell Trish the truth, that this was all your idea. She'll never believe you. Then we'll see. {\*LET'S MAKE THIS WORK ROOM 214 - HUNTER} You in? Are you looking for me? You know what Kelly's problem was? She was just so desperate for attention that she didn't even care what kind of a nut job she got it from. Come on, Shane. I'm not listening to you. Kelly did, Kelly listened, and look what happened to her. Were you talking to her about L.A.? What did you think she was gonna do when she got there? I don't know, but she wanted to try. She wanted a fresh start. There's no such thing. Moving was not gonna save Kelly. She took him with her everywhere she went. - She dug his name into her skin. - Aren't you the one - who gave her the Wakefield tattoos? - She wanted those. - They were her idea. - Then why do you sound so guilty? It's not your fault, Shane. It's not JD's either. I know what really happened. That's why I came here, to tell you. Kelly was murdered. What? - You don't know that. - I do, too. Kelly was right. It was Wakefield. He was after her. He was the one who did it. You know, you're as daft as she was. I know you're worried people might blame you, but I know you love Kelly. She wouldn't shut up about Wakefield. Well, she knew. She... She could feel him... watching her and coming into her house in the middle of the night. I didn't believe her. And that's how he got away with it. Nobody did. He chose Kelly because no one would believe her. John Wakefield slipped the noose around her neck, just like he did to her mother. She probably didn't even struggle. In a way, it's what she wanted... what she needed to find peace. And then, he yanked her up... and watched her die. Drop the knife! What does Richard think? Everyone thinks commercial real estate's a sinkhole right now, and I'm happy to let them think that. Of course, Richard wants to play it safe. I know grandmothers with more investment savvy. I'll leave you two alone. I know you got a lot of money, and you can say whatever you think, but you're a bully, and I'm tired of it. I hope your toast is a little more eloquent than that. My toast isn't your problem. I know you brought Hunter here. Don't worry, I'm not gonna tell Trish, but know this: I'm marrying her, and I'm gonna make her happy, whether you approve of me or not. Come on. That was some story you told in there about Wakefield still being alive. I was just trying to distract Shane. I think he's blaming himself for Kelly's death. I don't think Kelly killed herself, but I don't think Shane did it. What do you think? I don't know, but Kelly was a sweet girl, and if someone did that to her... if someone hung her up to die, I'm gonna make sure that person pays. Dude, you are so shiny. Yeah, and I smell really great, too. Sorry about today, mate. Totally my bad. I owe you a beer, okay? That's harsh. - Truly. - Our best player just got played. - I am gonna kill Cal. - No. No, you're not. You left him hanging like a pi?ata. He got you back. You're even. Awesome. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to thank my future father-in-law, Thomas Wellington, for this dinner, for this week, and most importantly, for fathering the most amazing woman I have ever met. Thank you. I'll be honest... some of my friends wondered if Mr. Wellington would ever accept the... guy that used to clean his boat as his son-in-law, But the... lovely and surprising truth is... he doesn't have a choice. To Thomas Wellington. Health, wealth and all happiness. Hello? That was foolish. Your check. But you'll never speak to my daughter again. {\*MADE FOR: "THE CANDLEWICK INN" MAYFAIR LONDON} Hey, Doc. The red in Kelly's eyes... I can't explain how or why, but, Sheriff... it was ink. - Okay. - Charlie, did you hear what I said? Someone did this to her, someone put ink... I heard you.
