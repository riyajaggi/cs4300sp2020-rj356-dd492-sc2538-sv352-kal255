 so we'll give you a call back once they've transferred the prisonertour custody. If the sheriff knows abby's wakefield's kid, this is his way of punishing abby. I just can't see my dad doing any of this. The killings, I mean, taking madison. Jimmy, can you put us all in your boat, take us to seattle? - Yeah, we can do that. - Come on, man, fire it up!

 You're my daughter! it's you. You look just like your mother. Why... Why are you doing this? You don't know? Abby! Abby? It was wakefield. It was wakefield. He's getting away. He's getting away! - No! Abby! Stop! - Henry, let me go! - He's getting away! - That's what he wants! - No! - No! We will get him! We'll get him, but not like this! Not like this-- we got to be smart. - We got to be smart. - No, no, no, no, no, no! No! we should get him to the clinic. Find doc campbell. No, it's not safe out there. Besides, you know, you're... doing fine. Well, it's not the burns that I'm worried about, shane. He still hasn't woken up. How the hell did he survive that explosion? Always was a lucky bastard. Why would wakefield deliver jimmy? We don't know for sure it's wakefield. Kid might be telling stories again. You don't blame a little girl because she was raid for her mother's life. Don't get all high-and-mighty with me. You're the one who sent abby out there to god knows what. She had good reason to think it was about abby. We all did. Madison, nobody blames you for saying it was the sheriff. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Cal and sully are out there somewhere. One of us s to watch for them. sully, careful, mate! - How's the shoulder? - It's not bad. all right. I, uh... I got the bullet out, but i kind of made a mess of it. You passed out before you gave me any real instructions. - You did clean the wound, right? - Yeah, yeah, but the stitches didn't turn out too good. I just kept doing more and more of 'em until the bleeding stopped. I hope that's cool. It sounds like you handled it masterfully. Hey, sully? I know. Look, we got to get to the boat. we should get back to the cannery. It's not safe here. We can't leave him. all these bodies. One guy. How the hell does one guy do all this? Wakefield killed my dad the same way he killed my mom. Yeah. That's my dad. He told me. Madison? Is john wakefield the person who told you people died on this island? He was here the first day. He helped me pick flowers for my flower girl basket. Remember? I told you, mommy. My new friend. Is daddy dead? Yes. Is abby going to die because of me? No, honey. Henry and danny went to get abby. They'll all be back soon. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure they're on their way right now. Oh, keys, keys, come on. I'm gonna kill john wakefield. -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:?????? Harper's Island Season01 Episode11 Abby, why'd your dad tell us wakefield was dead all these years? He thought he was doing the right thing. It cost us so much. I know. He rescued jimmy... for you. So if this is all about getting revenge on your dad, making him look like a bad guy, now that he's gone, is wakefield done? Shane. How's he doing? Well, the bleeding stopped. Now if he'd just wake up. How long is your generator gonna last? Probably not long enough. The cable from the mainland was cut. Cell tower, land lines... everything. Could be a few days. But what about the marina explosion? Someone's got to notice. Marina's in a deep harbor. You can't see it from the mainland. The power and phones here are not the most reliable. No one from the mainland is gonna notice if they don't hear from us for a few days. But what about the dead cops? When they don't report in, someone will come, right? Yeah, sure, eventually. Hey, chloe, come on. Trish, why did you have to get married on this stupid island? - Mommy? - Just a second. I know you're scared about cal, okay? But we have to stick together... mommy, he's here! - no! - Go, go, go! Get out of here! Come on, come on, come on, come on! No... come here! Come here! Shea, go! Get in the bathroom! Chloe, get out of here! Go! Go, maddie! Go! you don't scare me. - It's gonna be okay. - go! There! Go! Come on! - what about you? - Just go. - Trish... - shea, go! Come on! I'm coming. Go. Here, take my hand. Keep going. - What about shane and jimmy? - Mom! Wakefield got them. Come on, I know where we can go. This is the place, right? Yeah. No boat. Looks like we're stuck. Thanks to me. If I hadn't gone to the wrong side of the car, I wouldn't have been shot. Way I see it, I owe you one. I mean, if you hadn't been there, that bullet would've hit me instead. Saving me cost us our way home. No, we don't know that. I mean, sailboat could've been gone for days. I just want to get chloe off this island. I just want to get chloe. let's get you back to her. the door's open. trish? trish! Henry, wait! no one else is here. Did they make it? I don't know, danny. There's blood everywhere. - Jimmy? - Jimmy. Trish? Maybe they did get away. He's not done. he's nowhere near done. I came here with henry and abby when we were looking for her dad. We'll be safe here. Her dad's been tracking wakefield for years. Madison, don'T. But it's interesting. It's like... the sheriff was just waiting for wakefield to happen again. It's different. Wakefield's changed the game. Before tonight, he was in the shadows, picking us off one by one. But after killing my dad, he stepped out. He wanted me to see him. Yeah, right before he killed you. We hadn't shown up... but why risk it? He could've slipped away and everyone would've blamed my dad for all the murders. Maybe that's not what he wants. Maybe he wants people to know. That he's alive, that he's responsible. - And now this. - He's not gonna stop. Not until we're all dead. Danny. I can'T. I can't do it. It's enough. Danny... we have to finish this. What a horrible man. He was nice to me. john wakefield is a sociopath. Some bad people pretend to be nice to get what they want. Tonight, you saw who he really is. No more pretending. Yeah. That's right. That's enough, chloe. you guys. It's the tunnel system all over the island. Wait a second. There's another piece. It's the candlewick. The tunnels go everywhere. This is how he gets around. - it could be trish. - Could be a trap. Someone's signaling from the church. Could be one of the locals. Maybe somebody got help. - Maybe it's henry. - Or cal. If they went to the cannery and we weren't there, they wouldn't know where to find us. Madison, sweetart, we're gonna go find the others and we'll come back for you and your mom, okay? Okay. Trish... don't go. It could be him. Shea, henry is out there. And if it's him, if he needs me, I have to go. Okay? You guys will be safe here. Lock the hatch after us. shea... I love you. I think that's deputy lillis's car. - Maybe he's the one ringing the bell. - Then why did he stop? - Henry! - Trish. - Oh, my god. You're okay. - Yeah. Oh, I was so worried. Shane helped us get away. - Did he...? - No. We left shea and madison in the sheriff's attic. They're okay. Is jimmy with them? - No, he was at the cannery. - Well, not when we showed up. - Did u guys ring the bell? - No. Well, somebody did. We came here to find out. Cal? Cal? We should check the belfry. Maybe there's someone still up there. we shouldn't be in here. Danny, what are you doing? I think we could use a prayer. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. What happened with the sheriff? Wakefield killed him. Abby. I'm so sorry... about your dad. I was... I was so wrong. It's okay. I was, too. both my dad's deputies are dead. There's no one else. We have to get out of here. hey, who the hell is that? Get to the door. Sully. Oh, man, am I glad to see you. There's no boat. We'll find a way. - Where's chloe? - What are you talking about? She was... she was just here next to me. Chloe? Chloe! How could she just vanish? She couldn't have-- we got to keep looking. - We have been. - I don't understand. He was here. Wakefield was here. He took chloe. Look. There's a tunnel under the church. I found this at your dad's house. It's a blueprints of the tunnels all over the island. Jimmy! - Abby. - Oh, my god, oh... I saw shane and nikki. How did you get out of there? I woke up at the cannery. Saw them dead. There was no one else. I walked... I walked to town to get help, but it's empty. Then I heard the church bells, and that's when I got my ass over here. How did I get to the cannery? The last thing I remember, shane was yelling at me on the docks. - Wakefield brought you. - He delivered you to us. He's alive, jimmy-- I sahim. Then why didn't he kill me? Over here! - Move this! - Be careful. Gotcha. All right? Okay, so it looks like there are three entrances to the tunnels: The candlewick, here at the church, and the storm drain. - So if we block all those... - he'll be trapped. What's this? Where does this go? We'll find out. Trish, you and jimmy take nikki's car, block off that storm drain entrance. I know where it is. It's where we found madison. Stay there-- we'll come get you. You guys, get back to the hotel, seal off that tunnel leading to the kitchen. You make sure he can't get through there. - Come on, let's go! - Seal us in. Hey, we, uh, we've done this before, with beth. - Didn't end well. - We have to try. Be careful down there. And bring her back. Cal! Why are you doing this to us? We didn't do anything to you! I almost died for a woman like you. My friends are gonna find me... and they're gonna kill you! you doing okay, man? Yeah. Yeah, I just, uh, lost it for a while there. Abby's dad hanging like that. Nikki and shane. It was awful, man. I'm glad you're safe, though. I wasn't sure cal would have your back. Cal's okay. He stayed awake while I dug a bullet out of his shoulder. - He's tougher than you thought, huh? - Yeah. But it's not... it's not just that. It's him and chloe. He really loves her, man. Yeah, well, I always liked cal. - You like everybody. - So? So, I... wish I had that. It's this way. Wait up, cal-- we need to be careful. Yeah, if we wait too long, she'll be dead-- I'm not having that. This way. Why is he doing this? Why us? I don't know. I was worried it was because of me, or... or my dad. Now my dad's dead, and... wakefield hasn't stopped. There's got to be something else. - Why didn't he kill me? - What about my wedding? Maybe I pissed him off somehow, or wellington did. Yeah, maybe there is no reason. Maybe wakefield's just killing 'cause he likes it. - We go left. - Stay close. henry wanted a dead end; we gave him a dead end. Yeah, but we don't get any points for style. you know, I've been thinking. Yeah? If we get out of this, I got to change some things. What kind of things? I got to open myself up to people. I think I'm guarded. You know, life... life's too short to be guarded. Guarded? You? You're not guarded. You're scared. I'm not scared. you think we got him? okay, you were right-- I'm scared. Our friends are in there with that. I know. I'm feeling guilty, too. We have to go in there. this is really gonna suck. madison. I told you to stop going through all the john wakefield files. I'm not. Mom, the sheriff has lots of stuff on someone else we know. Do you hear that? Sounds like water. Cal? Chloe! Cal... go. Go. Chloe! Cal? Cal, cal. Help me! Cal, I'm in here! Cal. Cal. Cal! is your fianc? willing to die for you? Chloe! I thought we were gonna trap him. She could be anywherE. Do you know where we are? No. We'll never find her. Chloe! do you hear that? - No. - It was chloe. Had to be. Cal. Cal, wait! Came from over here. Hey, wait, wait, wait. - What? - Listen. it's chloe! Chloe! Help me! Chloe! Cal, get down! Out of the way. Cal, go find chloe, get her out of here and don't wait for us. Abby! Chloe! Abby, we have to stick together. No, we have to end this.
