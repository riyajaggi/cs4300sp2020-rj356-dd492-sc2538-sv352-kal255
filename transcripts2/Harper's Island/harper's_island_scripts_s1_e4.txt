 My name is Abby Mills, and I've come home to Harper's Island. My best friend is getting married to the girl of his dreams. But not everything about this trip is a celebration. Seven years ago, I left this place after John Wakefield murdered six people. My mother was one of them. Everyone else has moved on... believes the killings are in the past. But I can't help feel... ... there's more to come.

 Previously on Harper's Island... Come on, Trish. It's Uncle Marty to you. You're part of the family now. - I want another chance. - You had your chance. Three years ago, I was yours. But now go. I'll leave tonight, but it's gonna cost you 50 grand. Or I can tell Trish the truth. That this was all your idea. But you'll never speak to my daughter again. I'm Shea. I called about my sister's bachelorette party. Hi, Karena. Nice to finally meet you. We're in pretty good shape for tonight. Great! I just want it to be a lot of fun, you know?

 Auras, tea leaves, stuff like that. I brought a list of birthdays for horoscopes. And I also wrote down a few details about each person. Just in case you and the spirits need a little help. Thanks. I think I should be fine. - Please don't touch that. - It's okay if she looks through them. Your daughter has a lively spirit. Yeah, we get that a lot. They're pretty, aren't they? They look magical. They are. They tell me things about people. I know things about people. Does this mean someone's going to die? You know how many people have asked me for this crab roll recipe? It'll be our secret, Nikki. I've never had to get a wedding gift for a millionaire before. Henry's not a millionaire. Is he? You know what I mean. The Wellingtons have like 60 houses. What do you get someone like that? This must have taken you forever to make. Get your own millionaire and I make one for you too. I should get over to the newspaper. I wanna finish before tonight... bachelorrette party! You should come here instead. I am bartending Henry's hoo-ha. Sounds like fun. - Need an assistant? - I sure as hell could use one. No takers? Is it 'cause I have crabs? Tough room. You got it. Have a good one, Jimmy. You're not dressed. As in, like... naked. That's me... naked. No clothes. - I know what this is. - What? Maybe I just couldn't decide what to wear today. This is you trying to tell me to have a good time at my bachelor party today... but not too good a time. Bachelor party? Was that... Was that today? I guess I'll just go put some clothes on then. Are you... are you sure we have time for this? Because it sound like you have a very busy day. Hey, mom, are spirits real? I don't know. Why? I think the spirits are telling Karena bad things. No, honey. Karena is just for fun, all that stuff is just for fun. Transcript: FRM Harper's Island Season 1 Episode 04 "Bang" I have a secret agenda. In giving me a ride or delivering crabs? I wanted to say I was sorry. I mean, everything that happened with Shane. And Kelly dying. Like, I mean, I... And I'm not gonna defend Shane. And the only reason I even bring it up is that I want you to like it here. To enjoy yourself on the island. Not all of us island guys are psycho. You wanna help me have a good time? I do. Let me drive. - Gentlemen, welcome to the big day! - Yo. Most people consider the wedding to be the big day. No, most women consider the wedding the big day. Most men, would consider the bachelor party to be the most important event of the week. Which begs the question, did you find... Her name is... Stacy. Sweet. Stripper. Don't get to excited. She's a local girl. We'll be lucky if she has more teeth than fingers. Guys. This is my party? Three guys and a cooler of beer? You shouldn't have. Don't be a hater. Tha't from all of us. Really? Today? Guys. This is awesome. Come here! Some guys love Vegas, some guys love pub crawls, - but Henry Dunn loves to fish. - You're the man! Only mentioned it every day since you've been here. We can take the hint. Even seasick boy is gonna give it a go. - Wish me luck. - Attaboy, Booth. I've rented a boat, I trust you can drive. Soon as Malcolm's done with his pitch thing to Wellington, - we're on our way. - Great. - Who else's coming? - Just the groomsmen. And, Muffin. Muffin? Who's Muffin? Muffin! Muffin! Muffin! I've done my homework. Sacred Turtle Beer... is a winner. My short-term goal is to raise enough startup capital to get this product into the market locally and Washington and Oregan. How much are you looking for? My pro formas on a three-year business plan were derived on an accrual basis and yielded an above-market return. Bottom line? For a hundred thousand dollars, you can be a majority stakeholder in Sacred Turtle Beer. My God! Mom's tea set? I had Richard ship it in from Palm Beach. I taught we could have a tea-party with mom's china. As part of the bachelorette activities. Like Mom's here with us. That is so sweet, thank you so much. What did you do? I didn't do it! I didn't do it! These are amazing. I feel great. You guys think of a better way to spend the day? Is it considered fishing if we don't catch any fish? You have to be patient. Malcolm, come on, man. Look, I'm sure you did great. You knew going in there, Wellington was a real-estate guy. No, it's just... I had him, you know. That bastard Richard sandbagged it. Said it wasn't part of the Wellington family portfolio. I'm doing him the favour, you know? Ground floor. What about all the money we gave you? - Two grand doesn't buy a lot of floor. - Two grand? We kind of lame. Come on you guys, I'm serious. I needed that. I am totally tapped. That's more like it. Hold that for me, would you? Here we go. - Go baby! - All right, somebody grab the net. Thank you. What happened? Did it get away? Think you lost it man. Sorry about that. You coward! I'm saving Muffin! You better be careful in there. Why is that? Holy... I got you good! I'm done, I'm ready to move straight to the too-much drinking part of the day. What did you say about seagulls and fish out here? I said they usually go hand in hand. Shall we go check it out? That's it. When's the last time you had this aligned? I noticed it was pulling to the left. You could use new... brake pads, too. Didn't know letting you drive was gonna cost me so much money. Then again, you never were a cheap date. See, I did you a favour by leaving. I was pretty upset when you left like that. I mean, it was pretty hard on all of us. I just wanted to be there for you. It wasn't about you, Jimmy. I got over it. I've moved on. I'm glad. Moved on... a lot. So, how about you? You're driving the guys crazy in Los Angeles? I hold my own. The nightlife is amazing and the guys are... You can imagine. Jimmy Mance, are you there? Your girlfriend's looking for you. Julia says her car won't start. I'll take care of that later. I don't mind a quick stop. It might be fun to meet this... Julia. All right. What do you think? Somebody scuba diving? Maybe, but it doesn't seem anchored. What is that? Let's get out of here. Yeah, I'm with you man. Do they have 911 out here? I'll call the harbormaster. Have you ever seen a dead body before? Yeah, my grandma, but it was nothing like this. - Hold up. - What? Wait! Get over here, dude! Man, that smells! Malcolm, get back over here. - Hang on! - No, no hang on! Come on! Money! I'll give you money, just get back here. No, I mean like lots of money, like thousands. - And a gun. - Money, gun, dead body. This guy is so a drug dealer. If somebody killed him, then why wouldn't they take the money? - Maybe he killed himself. - Right. He felt bad about being a drug dealer. What? No, we're not taking that money! I think we should vote. I'm sorry, I'm with Henry. I'm calling it in. I guess we're taking the money. Hi sweetheart. - Is my mom looking for me? - No, honey. As promised. - Have you seen Katherine? - I haven't seen her in a while. I've been getting hustled by my granddaughter at "Go Fish." I saw Katherine on the steps to the pool little while ago. Thanks sweetie. Have fun. Do you have any threes? Go fish. - Please. - Are you calling for help? No one's gonna help you Katherine. Nobody cares about the rich men's wife. Try it again. Nothing. - That's it? - That's it. Any luck? No, Julia, sorry, I couldn't figure it out. All right then. Thanks for trying. I suppose I could make do without groceries this week. Julia, if you want, I'm going into town after I drop Abby off. Maybe you'd like to ride with us. If you don't mind company, I'll go get changed. You do this every week, don't you? Drive her around, help her out. It's so not L.A. Nothing's lonelier than taking a shuttle to the airport. Or landing. No one waiting for you. I'm gonna get going. You take Julia. I'll walk to the paper from here. Thanks for letting me drive. Just hold it tight, be cool. - What did you catch? - We didn't see a boat. - Heard you went fishing. - We just caught a couple small sockeye. Lovely. Did you guys know that this same species of fish in a landlocked body of water is called a kokanee. I'm a bit of a piscator. Chloe probably mentioned it. He means... not in so many words. We should get this cleaned up. Of course. Time for a good filet. I'd say I'm quite well versed, if you need a hand. Thanks, we got it covered. See you tonight at the bachelor bash! - Should we count it again? - Why? It's been 250 grand every other time. That's 50 grand a piece. Okay, we need a plan. I have a plan. Return it in. We can't. We commited a crime. Look, we stole this. We sank the boat. If it's drug money? - We don't know that. - Yeah, we do. What if there's, like... dealers or gangsters looking for this. Just calm down. I gotta sit down. Hey Henry, can I talk to you for a sec, please? Listen, I'm... I'm sorry about what happened on the boat. I saw that money and I just... my brain kinda fritzed, you know? I just want you to know that I know that we're here for your wedding. And that's what's important. It's cool. Now listen. We just need to be smart and figure how to get rid of that. About that. I just wanna to kinda mention to you. I'm kinda completely tapped out. Like... scary broke. See, I went all in on my beer venture and... I'm paying off my MasterCard with my Visa, my Visa with my AmEx, and I'm totally leveraged. We're gonna figure out a way to help you. You don't get it. Guys like me... I'm not gonna marry a Wellington. This money that we found... this is my one shot. - Mal, you know I would... - Just... Just think about it. Okay? Just... just think about it. Okay, here's what I think we should do. We leave the money here and deal with the dead guy later. Today's my bachelor party. I wanna have fun. And then, after the wedding, we'll figure out what to do with this. Agreed? Agreed. I'm Abby, I called last week about getting a back issue July of 91. It was... a photo of a boy and a big fish. Right, just a sec. You know about the Wakefield stuff? It's pretty weird, huh? Why are they out here? Somebody wanted everything we had on it. Can I ask who? I'm not sure. I wasn't here when they called. But they never came to pick it up. Here's the article you ordered. I'm so sorry. - Are you okay? - Yeah, it... it was my fault. What's wrong? Katherine... with Richard... she just... So... I wanted to have a special surprise today for Trish. I know how much she misses her mom and how much she loves the rest of her family and all of you lovely ladies so I asked myself... what can I do as a new stepmother to show my love and become a member of this wonderful club? And then, I realized that every club needs a uniform Aren't they great? - They're so pink. - And I got black ones for the guys. Thanks, Mrs. Wellington. Can I, I'm sorry, I... I need to talk to the both of you for just a moment. I have asked the staff. No one heard a thing. Look, we can fix this. When we get back, we'll just buy you a new set. There is no new set. This was my mother's. Where is Madison? I'll Find her. One by one. Madison? I'm not going to get to be a flower girl, Abby. Who told you that? The spirits told me. Top shelf, my good man. We're all going to jail. Look, we're... Probably not keeping it, but if we could, how would you spend your 50 grand? Charity. And if by charity, you mean save the Sacred Turtle, then I thank you. Booth? Easy. Lawyer fees. - Come on. - No, I'm serious. This is like aiding and abetting or a violation of a corpse or... - You know how long I'd last in jail? - You'll be fine... as a bottom. - What? - A bottom, is... is that bad? - A little bit. - Kind of depends. On what you like. All right, play it cool. Those are drug dealers. - They're looking for their money. - We got to get rid of it. Guys, it's too late we sank the boat. You sank the boat. I saw you guys rushing out here. Is everything okay? - Dude, don't point! - What, what? - There are two big dudes inside. - With guns. But we... we don't know. I mean, they could be hunters. Just stop it. Okay, look, Malcolm, I'm sorry, but we're done with this. We have to find a safe place to put that money, and after this all blows over, I'm going to figure out a way to turn it in. - Where is safe? - I don't know, but not in our rooms not anywhere where they can tie it to us. All right, we have to hide it. - Not me. - Me, neither. Well, then, we'll draw straws. - I forgot to make a short one. - Oh, come on. My bad. Ready? Okay. You can do this. Just put it somewhere where no one's going to find it for a few days. It will be fine. Fine. - Good job, man. - Okay, guys. I'm seeing a change, a change in fortune. All right, lady, are you talking about my mom's china? I don't think so, no. This hasn't happened yet. Upside down, it means betrayal by someone you love. Not my Henry. Drink! You know, I never should have agreed to this game, okay? She's right this is not fair, She's going to be saying "Henry" all night. Drink! That's enough. You know, I already know who's going to betray me. It's a woman, isn't it? But the one who betrays you is also your savior. Really? Damn it! I'm going to say what we're both thinking. That we shouldn't have been so hard on Malcolm about the money? No, dude. None of this should be about Malcolm. All right, this is Henry's big day. We need to make sure he has an awesome night. Okay? I talked with Malcolm. He realizes we couldn't keep it. Said he'd get his ass over here. Hell of a day. Hell of a night. Congrats. Trish saw you. What? In the cellar. She saw you with Katherine. Okay. Okay? That's it? What do you want, Henry? I don't know. Some remorse, maybe. Come on, man, you've got a kid. Trish is freaking out about Shea. You could ruin this whole wedding. Are we done? What would happen if Wellington found out? You go ahead and tell him. See what happens. - You're last. - No, that's good. I'm fine. - It's okay, you don't have to. - Come on, it's just for fun. Okay. I figure we already had one close encounter today. I'm sure this one will be much more pleasant. God, that's so beautiful. Was this your mother's? It wish our moms could be here. I just really wish mine were here right now. I'm sorry. I really... I have to go. That was fun. What the hell was that? I am so sorry. I'm fine. That's okay. I don't believe in this stuff. Yeah... me neither But you know what I do believe in? This is beautiful. I hope you had fun today. I had fun. Man, I love being your best man. Really. You know, Abby should be here. - Yeah. - Where the hell is Abby? Where is...? - Oh, my God, be cool, it's them. - What? - Who? - Be cool, be cool. I'm looking for a guy named Sully. Either of you guys Sully? Yeah, he is. You got the money? - What, uh...? - The money. For the girl. - Wait. - I don't know anything about a girl. You guys are with the stripper? Oh, man. They're the bouncers, Henry. - They're the bouncers. - Okay. Go... Booth is going to pee his pants. Oh, you guys. That's it. I swear to God, I am going to bust a cap... It's cool! It's me, it's cool. Don't, don't shoot. Man, you scared the hell out of me. What are you doing? Nothing... I was, I was watching your back. Damn it, don't do that again. I've been hit! Wait. I'm okay. I'm okay. - You shot yourself. - What? No, it didn't hurt. I mean, , it would hurt, right? Of course it would, man. I mean, it must be a flesh wound. That was a close call, dude. Oh, my God, that's a lot of blood, dude. Really? I think you hit something. Damn, this blood... where is it coming from? - I got to get some help, okay? - No, don't leave me, please. - We need some help. - Don't... leave me. Let me try... applying some pressure.

No, that's what makes it dirty. You have to leave. - What? - He wants you dead. Let go of me. Please. He won't stop. My Chloe is... wild and impetuous And idiotic. I don't get it. And I can't get her out of my mind. Honest opinion... do you find him attractive? Has anyone ever told you... that you have the sexiest accent? Whatever. Nikki, get Mad Mal a beer. You made it.
