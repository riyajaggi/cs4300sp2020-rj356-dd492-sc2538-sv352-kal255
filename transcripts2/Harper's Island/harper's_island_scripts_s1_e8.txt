 Cole Harkin. I was one of his deputies. Your dad can't be trusted... he's a liar. Hey, Sheriff, we got something! It's over, JD! You're going to look pretty stupid When I'm locked up and somebody else gets killed. You let Booth die in the woods for money! I'm going to the sheriff, Tell him everything. Where's Daddy?

 Daddy? Harper's Island S01E08 Our boat's pulling in. We'll see you all down there. Madison? Have you seen a little girl? She's nine... her name is Madison. Sorry, ma'am. Madison? Madison, honey, we're leaving. Madison, we're leaving! Hey, Trish? Are you ready to go? Abby, um, gave this to me this morning. Look at us. I wish you were going home with me. Me, too. I just want to make sure they take care of your dad. Poor guy. Supposed to be the best day of his life. I'm just glad we're finally going home. I'm just glad they found the killer. Did you know him very well? JD? Not exactly the same social circles. I did. He was a really good guy. You should have seen him and Henry. They were like... best friends. Turn around. Put your hands behind your back. Cuff his feet, too. I love a chain gang shuffle. You know, he's been telling me all about his killings, Sheriff. I would be careful if I were you, 'cause he said you're next. So, when are you going to let me out? 'Cause, you know, the wedding's canceled, and I-I've done my time. Shut up, Shane. State police will be here first thing tomorrow morning. They'll take you over to San Juan Island for your arraignment. Help me understand, JD. We've known each other since you were a boy. Why did you do this? I didn't do anything. Well, the evidence says otherwise. Tell me about Cole Harkin. Why'd you send him to Abby? He did that himself. Why didn't he come to me? Well, you'd have to ask him that. If this man can help prove your innocence, you've got to tell me where he is. You know Butch Strand's old hunting shack? But I'd be careful. He really doesn't like you. So, when am I going to come visit you in Los Angeles? I'm sure we could find room on the boat. Yeah, not today. Good-bye, Abby. Tell Henry I'm sorry. Madison's gone. She has to be around here somewhere. No, she's not here... I've looked everywhere. She is gone. Have you talked to Richard? Maybe he knows where she is. No one knows where he is, either. I've called and called, and all I get is voice mail. You don't think Richard could have taken... Hey. Look, we will find Madison, okay? Don't worry. But the boat is leaving. No, Shea, it'll wait. We're going to help you find her. Come here. Hey, guys? Guys? We need help finding Madison. Of course, yeah. Come on. You know, things were great on this island before you got back. If you'd killed yourself the first time, maybe none of this would be happening. You had your chance to finish me, and you got cold feet. Shane, if you don't shut up, JD is going to be the least of your problems. Who's the coward now? What the hell? Oh, my God. Oh, my God, please don't shoot us. What are you... what are you doing? Is he dead? What do you think? Give me the keys, give me the keys. What are you waiting for? Give me the keys. Look, man, you can't run. If you run, you're just going to look more guilty. Yeah, you better run. Next time I see you, you're dead. You hear me? You're dead! One by one. I gave Richard this room last night. Well, it doesn't look like he ever used it. Richard may have failed you as a husband, but he was a good father. He knew I would get custody. He would never take Madison. He loves her. Listen to me. We will find them. Okay? Both. Madison! Maddy! Where are you? Anything? No. Would she have gone down to the basement? It's hard to say. We should check. Madison? Isn't this Malcolm's room? Yeah. Any chance he'd go down to the boat without his bag? He's got to be around. Hey, Malcolm's a big boy. All right, let's just focus on finding the kid. Come here. Madison? Madison. Nice. If we miss the boat 'cause of this little... Come on, man, she might be freaking out somewhere. She saw her grandfather almost cut in two yesterday. Madison. What about Malcolm? Hey. With or without Malcolm, we're telling the sheriff what went down. Yeah, but if Malcolm ran off, how are we going to find Booth? He's the only one who knows where he's buried. I can't believe he's dead. Anything? I hate this place. I'm with you. Madison! Madison! Maddy! Hey, Abby. Thanks for giving Trish that picture. You're welcome. And I found a box of photos at my dad's. There's a sweet one of you, JD and your parents I want to give you. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry. That's probably the last thing you... No, no, no, I'd love to have it. I don't have a lot of pictures of my folks. Madison! Madison? This is bad. Don't say that, Shea. Should be a switch somewhere. It smells terrible down here. It's a rubbish incinerator. There's no way Madison would come down here. It's too creepy. Let's get out of here. Oh, my God. Oh, no. You'll burn yourself. Let me try and turn it off. She would never come down here, okay? What? What is it? Tell me. It's not her. It's not Madison. How can you tell? This isn't the skull of a child. Why would she run off like this when she knew we had a boat to catch? I think she does a lot of this stuff for attention. So, you think this is all a game? Let's hope so. Madison! Madison! What is it? I don't know. Stay here. Oh, God. Richard. Abby, answer it. We need help. Hello? Abby? Is it you, Abby? Madison? I'm supposed to tell you: if anyone leaves the island... I'll die. Madison... where are you? Madison! What is happening?! How come is he doing this? I don't know. Look, Madison's alive. We'll call my dad... he'll find her. I still can't get a signal. Me, neither. How is that possible? Madison called, and then nothing. I don't know. We can use a landline inside... come on. Oh, good. The line is dead. So is this one. Why would somebody do that? Cut the phones? We should find my dad. We should do more than that. We should call the mainland. This is too big. Your dad needs help. Damn it. We need to get everyone, make a plan. What does that mean, "If anybody leaves, she dies"? Who's "anybody"? I think it's all of us. Yeah, but is it anyone from the wedding or anyone from the island? All I know is what she said. Why would Madison call you instead of someone in our family? How did she sound? Was she scared? How... how do we know it's not one of her creepy games? Oh, Sully, please! How did she make the phone call? The sheriff arrested JD for the murder of Trish's dad, right? If JD's in jail, then who got Madison to call Abby? Maybe they don't have the killer. You guys just found Richard. And who was that we found in the incinerator? So far, it's been Trish's dad, Richard and now Madison. I... I hate to say it, but it seems to me like this is Wellington business. Oh, come on. It's got nothing to do with the rest of us. He's right. they said "anybody", they probably meant her family. How can you say that? This is a little girl we're talking about here. Yeah, and she's a Wellington. Hey, Sully, will you shut up for a minute. You have no idea what's going on here. My Uncle Marty was killed, too. Uncle Marty? Why didn't you tell us? We just found out yesterday. You knew. You just didn't say anything. Perhaps we should just take a moment... No, no. I'm out of here. Please. Don't leave. This is my daughter we're talking about. Come on, man, this isn't about you... this is about... Why is her life any more important than any of ours? Okay... who have I forgotten? Who haven't we seen? Um, your cousin, Ben, didn't arrive. Beth and I have been calling Lucy for days... she hasn't answered. I know she's dead. I can feel it. Henry's uncle was killed. Mr. Wellington, Richard, maybe the minister. Anybody seen Malcolm or Booth? Chloe, darling, this isn't helpful. We don't know if these things are all related. Of course, they are. This happened here before, and it's happening again. We're all sitting ducks getting picked off one by one. Chloe, will you please shut up? Everybody's thinking it, Trish. It's not just me. What? What? I wouldn't have sent the staff home if I would have known you guys would all still be here. I don't think anybody could've seen this coming. I am not sure this is the right idea. This is the only idea. You know, more people are accidentally killed by their own weapons than by the criminals they're trying to protect themselves from. Don't care. Terrified, unskilled people should not be handling weapons. That's why you don't get one. If you want us to stay here, we got to be able to defend ourselves. I'm going to need some shells. I just checked the fuses... they're fine. What does that mean? It means, whoever cut the phone lines killed the power. Could be the whole island. Do you have a generator? Yeah, but it's old. Well, we need to get it running right away. Shh. You hear that? What? That. Hey, who is that? Say something. You better say something, or you're going to die. Whoa, whoa! Chill. It's me, Jimmy. White flag. "Say something, or you're going to die"? What the hell is going on around here? Someone else was killed. Shea's husband, Richard. And their daughter, Madison, is missing. You've got a truck. You could take us to the boat. That's why I came. I didn't see you on it when it left. It left? Like a half hour ago. Why would they leave? They wouldn't. They didn't know about Madison. The phones have been down. We have to trust that Madison's okay. Oh, God. Either way, we don't need to stay here anymore. How is that? A boat full of people just left the island. Doesn't matter what we do now. Madison is still missing. I don't understand... how the hell are we getting out of here? You... you could take us on your boat. We'll pay you. What? Yeah, anything you want. Let's get out of here right now. No one's leaving. We still have to find Madison. If we stay here, more people die. No, we're going to get help. I tried the sheriff on the CB. I couldn't get an answer. So, we'll try the shortwave at the sheriff's station. It's battery powered. Yeah, okay. You two go to the station. See if you can get a hold of the mainland. Abby, don't take any chances. You, either. Was that your trap I sprung? Afraid so. Need to make sure the wrong person doesn't surprise me. When the hell did you get back to the island? You must be getting old if you're just now realizing I'm here. It's been a few weeks. I don't get out this way much anymore. JD Dunn sent me. Didn't know he was setting me up. He didn't set you up. He just knew you wouldn't believe him saying he was innocent. What are you doing here, Cole? Hunting a maniac. Same as you. You're the one who got JD all wound up over Wakefield's grave. I needed to know the man who did this to me was really dead. I've seen too many things that make me think otherwise. What are you saying? If Wakefield is dead, then somebody's doing a damn fine job of imitating him. You... should've come to me, not Abby. Abby's involved, whether you like it or not. Come on, Charlie. I worked with you for over 20 years. You're smarter than that. What's the most precious thing you could lose? I feel like we're being punished. We should have never taken that money from the dead guy on the boat, Henry. Maybe, but I don't think the world works that way. Come on. You can turn this thing on? I think so. Wait. What? Abby hit the light at the church, and Wellington got killed. What if this thing is rigged, too? Rigged, what, to explode? That's crazy... come on. All right. One... two... three. "Rigged to explode". Whoa! Holy... Okay, come on. Come on! Damn it! The battery is dead. So we're screwed. No. No, we can jump it. It's over here. Now what? I don't know. Hey! Is somebody out there? I'm in here! Get me out of here! Hey. Shane. Jimmy... thank God. Yo, um... Come on, man, get me out of here. Who did this? I have no idea. Lights went out, a gun went off. Deputy's dead, and JD Dunn got the keys. He was out the door. JD escaped? Yeah, the bastard left me in here with a rotting corpse. What about my dad? Shane, what happened to my dad? Is my dad okay? I know where he went. I heard him talking with JD. You get me out of here, and I'll tell you. Hit it. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Where is everybody? What the hell? Trish? Where is everybody? What are you talking about? I thought they were in the lounge. They left? What? I can't believe this. Shea, they're not going anywhere. I'm coming with you. No. No, you stay here. Shea, it's going to be okay. Shoot anyone you don't recognize. Who else has read this? Hard to say. Well, if anyone wanted to imitate Wakefield... this gives a pretty good idea how he felt. Where did you get this? Tracked it down a while back. Wakefield kept it while he was in prison. What's JD Dunn got to do with this? I wasn't aware you two were such good friends. If you had visited me at the hospital, you might have seen JD and his dad. They were the only folks who ever came. If you're blaming me for not sending flowers, then screw you. I had problems of my own. I'm not blaming you, Charlie. You asked about JD. He's helping me track the killer. Seems to me he is the killer. JD's just in a lot of pain. Then, who is? 'Cause... right now, you make a pretty good suspect. Because I look like a monster? Because you blame me as much as he did. I sent Wakefield away for 17 years... and all he did was plot his revenge. What you said before... about losing what's most precious... Seems that Abby coming home has set this thing off. I got to get her off the island. I don't want you dying on me. Not with your daughter still out there. You're going to lose that leg if I don't get help. Hey. Charlie! Abby. Charlie! Abby. Dad? Harkin. In the fire. Get the bag, Abby. What... Get the bag. Where? Harkin. Charlie, we got to get you to the clinic. No, get me to the marina. Get me to the marina. Okay. We just need to pick one. That's your big idea? Steal a boat? If it gets us away from here, you bet. Okay, let's try this. All right. Let's get those untied. A lot of times, people hide keys in the boat somewhere. Yes... I got them. Cal. I can't do this. I thought I could, but I can't... this is wrong. Are you kidding me? Hey, it's a little late for cold feet. If we leave and Madison is hurt... I don't think I could live with that. And I know you well enough to say you couldn't, either. You're wrong about that. I'm scared, Cal. Yeah, me, too. Chloe. Come on. You're with me, right? Beth! Come on. That's JD. What, you sure? I thought he was in jail. All right, come on. I want you to take Jimmy's boat. Get to the mainland. I don't care where. Stay there until this is over. I thought I could handle this on my own. Oh... But until you're gone... I don't know if I can protect you. No, Dad... we need to stop this. Please, Abby. I'm not leaving this time. JD's out. No, no, no. Stay with your dad. Go. Stay here. JD? Oh, God. Oh... Abby? JD, who did this? It's you, Abby. It's all about you.
