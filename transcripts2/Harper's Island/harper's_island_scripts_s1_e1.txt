 I don't know about daddy dearest,but there's a smoking hot rich girl checking you out. Come on. - Me? - Me. - Me. - No,me. - No,you said me. - No,she said me. - Yes,you. - Yes. I knew it. Sorry,guys. I win. Who's getting married? Uh,the groom is my best friend from growing up. You look familiar. Yeah,I grew up on the island. Right. You're Sheriff Mills' kid. What a shame. All those people. Terrible. I never would have believed something so awful could happen around here. We're still waiting on people,Daddy. Have you seen Cousin Ben? I don't want you to worry. It's my job to make sure everything goes according to plan. Uncle Marty! Henry! My boy! All right! Let's get this party going! Ol! - Uncle Marty. - Henry,Henry. Hi,Marty. Oh,come on,Trish,it's Uncle Marty to you. You're part of the family now. In fact,for the entire week,it's going to be Uncle Marty for everyone! Ol! Ol! Uncle Marty,I'm so glad you're here. Yeah,family's everything. How did you find a mariachi band in Seattle? You're the only guy who could pull it off. Never mind,I don't want to know. - No,you don't want to know. - Come on,I want you to meet my dad. Oh,he's going to love me. Thought you might never get out of that cab. Well,I needed a moment. - Second thoughts? - About going home? You know,I told him you'd come. Trish. Trish. I am so excited. - Hi,you look great. - Oh,no. How was your trip from LA? I am feeling a bit shaky from the flight. Have some champagne,Abner. You'll feel better. Oh,my God. Oh,what do you know? I do feel better. Here's to all of us... hooking up with all them. We're still waiting on Cousin Ben. He's always late. He always answers,though. Give him a call again. Voice mail again. We can wait if you want. - No. No,we should go. - Okay. All right,let's get her going. -=????԰???? http://sfile.ydy.com=- ??????Ʒ ????Ļ????ѧϰ???????Ͻ???????ҵ;?? -=YTET-????԰??Ļ??=- ????: msuper СҢ У??: ??????? ʱ????: ?????? ????? ?????? ??һ?? ??1?? All Wellingtons on deck. Pardon me,sir. Wellingtons,please. Hi,sweetheart. Where's Henry? Okay,that's everyone. - Say cheese. - Cheese. Shouldn't you be there? I don't think that's the plan. There'll be plenty of photo ops this week. You didn't think I was going to show,did you? I knew you were coming. - I didn't. - No? But I realized if I didn't come home now,I might never. And that scared me. You know,it's been seven years,Ab,since the murders. The island's moved on. It feels normal again. That's why Trish and I are getting married there. You'll see,it's the place we loved as kids. That would be nice. Abby so should have been his best man. You're mixing up best man with best friend. Best friend takes care of the feelings. Best man takes care of the bachelor party. Please tell me it's going to be something seriously debauched. It's probably your cousin Ben. Tell him we can charter a boat for him tomorrow. Caller:HUNTER JENNINGS No,it's... it's not him. Come on. You don't know about the muers? John Wakefield-- he killed,like,six people. How can you not remember? Chloe has a thing for serial killers. It's so not a thing. - What set Wakefield off? - That's the big mystery. Seven years ago he just showed up on the island and started killing. He chopped,hung,and burned anyone that was unlucky enough to get in his way. You know,um,Henry's friend Abby? Her mom was one of 'em. - So she was on the island when... - Yeah. So that's why she's... Abby Mills. Hiya,Jimmy. I knew someday you'd come back to me. - And I knew you'd be here. - Oh,yeah? Anhow's that? I could smell you from the mainland. Oh,so that's how it gonna be,huh? Big city girl now. So,uh,I've changed,too. Uh,the hat or the gloves? No,I'm married now. You are such a liar. Yeah,yeah,no,I'm kidding. No,but I had you for a second,right,didn't I? No,I was just feeling pity for the poor girl. All right,pretend like I didn't. Hey,Abby,welcome home! It's just a visit. Hey,Abby,there's room. Oh,thanks. I think I'll walk. - Bring the bags to the hotel. - Okay. Let's go! Mom? Whoa,it's okay. It's okay. The killer's dead,Abby. Should've cut down that tree a long time ago. Come on,come on. Let's get out of here. Look,sooner or later I was gonna walk past that tree,so I thought... why not get it out of the way? Yeah. No,great. Ease into it. Hey,maybe we can drop in and say hi to your dad while we're at it. Okay,bad idea. Henry! Henry Dunn! You're here! Does Maggie know you're coming? Nobody does. You grew up so beautiful. Just the best week ever. Now... I've kept the afternoon open so that everyone could get settled. - Great. - The welcome dinner is tonight at 7:00. And,you two,we have a lot of work to do. Your wedding party has the entire inn for the week. And,since it's the end of season,you practically have the whole island to yourselves. - Oh,sorry. - Sorry. Excuse me. See you at dinner. Did you show Trish's niece the bloody finger in the box trick? I might've had something to do with it. Well,I knew everyone was going to love you. - Get in there. - Cal! Oh,this is nice. Wonder what that's about? Sailing? "My bounty is a boundless as the sea My love is deep." You always said you wanted to sail,so I rented a boat. I thought maybe we could slip away one day this week. How do I look? Dangerous. Do you know what I love about you? You always think of everything. Look at him. He's afraid to get his tighty-whites wet. You ever see me dressed for the Love Boat,you get a harpoon and put me out of my misery. Who did he bring over today? A wedding party. Trish Wellington is marrying Henry Dunn. - Really? - Yeah. - The Princess and the Pauper. - Yeah. Henry's okay. For a guy who only came to the island for the summers and knew a lot about boats. Tell me his psycho little brother isn't coming. I don't know. I'll tell you who did come,though. - Abby. - No. Don't go back to that,man. She dumped you. She didn't even give you a kiss good-bye in the rearview mirror. That wasn't about me. Oh,no,of course it wasn't about you. You know what your problem is? You're too nice. Hey,Al,you need some help? Get over here. Way too nice. I think something's caught in the rudder. I think it's just seaweed,Al. Okay,so...maybe when she left, it was because of her mom and the bad stuff that went down. But in all these years,did she ever call you? What,are you giving dating advice now? I got it. Keep it as a souvenir. Hey,excuse me. That's... that's my bag. Thanks. Look at this place. When you think about it,you're like something out of a fairy tale. You washed a millionaire's boats when you were a kid, and then you grow up to marry his daughter. I don't think Mr. Wellington considers it much of a fairy tale. Henry,listen to me. Never... - never let that old man intimidate you. - I won't. - I promise. - Good boy. Now,Henry,tell me about that blond on the boat. You know the one I'm talking about? You know,the... Chloe. Yeah? Chloe. I have something for you. Oh,yeah? Is it big? well,"big" is a relative term,isn't it? Are you going to show me or are you just going to think about it? I might just think about it for a bit. That's my Cal-- always thinking. The question is: Are you big? I promised Madison we'd find her a friend to play with. She's fine. Look at her. She's having a great time. Madison,you have one more minute before you have to get ready for dinner. Did you hear me? One more minute. Madison? JD,you in there? Just want to see if you need anything for tonight. Look,I don't know if you want to hear this or not,but I'm glad you came. With Mom and Dad gone,you and Uncle Marty are the only family I have. It means a lot. I***** Hello? Hello? Hubba,hubba! Look at you! You look amazing! - Yeah? - Yeah. Thanks. That's good,'cause...'cause I've decided. I'm gonna have fun tonight. No,no,no,no,no,strike that. I'm going to have fun this whole week and... anything you need,I got your back. You...You don't even have to ask. Have you been drinking? A little bit. A little bit? Yeah... yeah. So Abby seems like a great girl. All this time,I've heard about "Henry's friend," now I get it; you're right. She's really sweet. I know! I told you! Am I the only one who thinks that men and women can't just be friends? You've never had a guy who was just a friend? No. What?! You know,now that I think about it,I did have that one friend that was a guy. You remember. That doesn't matter. {6}1 new message from hunter jennings {6}you look lovely in blue. meet me in the south lobby If you mean that Italian exchange student junior year-- he doesn't count because he was married! Remember how he'd go on about his wife,how he loved her... Excuse me. One second. Hello,Trish. Hunter... What are you doing here? Hunter... I'm getting married. Are you sure? That guy is my hero. He's not that great. Oh,God,here we go. No,no,no,no,I'm serious. Uncle Marty's,what,50? - He's not married... - Okay. no kids... and here he is trying to tap some hot thing half his age. Come on! Oh-oh,okay,Oprah,so in,uh,what world does that make him not a superhero? As far as I'm concerned,eating ain't cheating. Oh,my God Tell that to your boyfriend in Seattle. How's it going? We were just talking about the groomsmen. So,you and Henry... you've been friends for a long time; you must've hooked up at least once,right? I... Everybody having fun? Yeah.Yeah. Has anyone seen JD? - I'm on it; I'll find him. - No,wait,that's not why I asked. I know. Go find that fiance of yours,and let me worry about finding your brother. Oh,hey,you might want to start... At The Cannery. I'm on it! We should go to Dad. He will make Hunter leave. No! Daddy will just cause a big scene and embarrass Henry. You have to tell Henry. Henry is the last person I want to know. I mean,I don't want anything to ruin this wedding. Trish,he's gonna be your husband. Couples shouldn't have secrets. Shea,please... We all know that you live the perfect life,so don't pass judgment on mine. Okay...look... if you have any doubts...about Henry...or getting married, now is the time to speak up. But I don't. I love Henry. And I'm going to marry him. Appreciate it. It means a lot to me. I'm curious if anybody else had seen you inside. I did as you asked-- straight to Trish. I don't know if you know how important is that you succeed here. For her sake. I just couldn't tell,but,um... she was definitely surprised. Uh,Trish did agree to meet me in the morning,though. Well,that's progress. I just want you to know,if there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm not leaving this island without her. My daughter's not marrying Henry Dunn. Oh,my God! Abby! Nikki! Look at you! Coming in here all Aphrodite. You're trying to make us local girls look bad. Oh,please! You're gorgeous. Yet you probably forgot that it's boring as hell here,most of the time. You looking for someone special? Yes,but not the fisherman you're so subtly implying. There's my perp. Any trouble? JD? A lamb among lions. Okay,then. I'm gonna text Henry. Make room,you animals. Any of you so much as lay a hand on this flower,I'll nail your tongue to the bar. Who's up next? You. Big city girl. Get over here. Who are you calling a big city girl? That's a pretty dress. You wearing that for me? I hope your game is better than your banter. our cousin ben wellington Madison! It's time for bed,sweetie! Oh,may I? You know...your daughter and my nephew... they make a stunning couple,don't you think? Ah,love. Love's a funny thing,isn't it? I fail to see your point,Mr. Dunn. Uncle Marty. Aw,come on,everybody calls me Uncle Marty. Your point. Well...I'm talking about purpose,y'know? I'm talking about my true calling in life. I thought you were in sales. See,one thing I know for certain, is that I was put on this earth to protect men like Henry-- men who deserve true love and happiness-- from men like you. Is that supposedo be some sort of a threat? Threat? Now,come on... we're just sitting around chatting like a couple of pals,ar't we? Anyway... pretty soon,you and me... we're gonna be family. Thanks for the cigar. My,I thought you'd be better than this. I'm at an emotional disadvantage. So they don't have any phones in LA,huh? Nope. E-mail... Not that I saw. You telling me you didn't miss me a little bit? I didn't say that. Then you did miss me. Tell you what-- I make this,you have to stop asking me so many questions. And if you don't? Name it. Really! You got yourself a deal there,big city girl. Scratch. Double or nothing? Do you mind? Stop being a creep. What? I like your tat. Broken hearts. Is he bothering you? No,Shane,I haven't even met the guy. Oh,we,allow me. This is JD Dunn. His family used to work summers on the island. JD...this is Kelly. We used to go out. You like the tattoo? I did it. You want to show him the other ones you have? Don't do this. What? It's cool. Me and JD,we're just...catching up. Right? So,heard you tried to whack yourself again. Now,was that just an attention- getting kind of thing, or were you really,really sad? You know what? You two probably have a lot to talk about,wt with all the cutting and the suicidal... That's enough,Shane! That's enough,Shane! Come on,come on! Hi,Dad. You okay? Never better. You're... probably wondering about the truck. It seems fine. That's the...that's the way I feel... The heater still works. Did you get the cards I sent? The ones at Christmas? Listen,I was... thinking maybe,now that you're here... Thanks for the ride,Dad. Will you unlock the door,please? I feel like I owe you an apology. For what? If I didn't have you out there looking for JD, you never would have run into your dad like that. We both knew that part of me coming home was dealing with my dad. I feel like I didn't do a very good job of watching your back tonight. Are you kidding me? You broke up a bar fight with a pool cue. Maybe if I wasn't playing pool,there wouldn't have been a fight. Come on. You know JD. He's gonna do whatever he wants. I'm just afraid that one of these days he's gonna do something a whole lot worse than just pick a fight. Maybe, but...there's a part of him that's very sweet. Yeah. Who were you playing pool with? Chloe? Chloe,darling,when I said swimming,I meant the pool! What are you doing? What are you waiting for? Okay. I want to show you something. Uh-uh,you gotta catch me first. Chloe... God...wait hold on! Chloe? Honey,did you have a bad dream? No? What's wrong,then? Did you know people died here? What? People were killed on this island. Who told you that? Madison... who said that? My new friend told me. Chloe? Oh,come on,Chloe,this isn't fun. Chloe! Chloe? Oh,babe,you should have seen your face! You jerk! It was just a joke. You could've killed me! Look,Chloe? No! Oh,God... Where is it? Where is it? Oh,come on! ruining my night,idiot! Was I loud? What? No! - Oh,my God,I was loud. - No! Oh,my God,I was so loud. No. It's okay. It makes me look really good. It's okay! It's okay. I love you. I love you,too. One sec. I...will be...right...back. Hey,honey,I was thinking... um,maybe we should get separate rooms from now on. That way,the night of our wedding can be special. Whatever you want,sweetheart. Hey,is somebody down there? Give me a hand,will you? I'm stuck. Can you help me here? wakefield murders sheriff's wife on killing rampage
