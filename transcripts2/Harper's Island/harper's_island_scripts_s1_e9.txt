 You know, things were great on this island before you got back. Shane, if you don't shut up, jd is going to be the least of your problems. you can't run-- if you run, you're just going to look more guilty. what are you doing here, cole? Hunting a maniac, same as you. Wakefield kept it while he was in prison. This gives a pretty good idea how he felt. Seems that abby coming home has set this thing off. Jd? Jd, who did this? it's all about you. Anything? Why aren't they back yet? It's been over an hour. How could your friends just leave like that, with madison still missing?

 Shea... please? - phones are still out. - Damn. How many hours till sunrise? too many. Come on, man, let us in. phones are out all over the island. No way to get hold of doc campbell. It's been a while since I treated a living patient. nasty puncture wound. The bleeding slowed a bit-- that's good. We'll debride and see what else we can do. Abby, could you apply some pressure here, please? Thanks. Darling, would you look for a refrigerator? - Try and get him some o negative. - Okay. Harkin's bag. There's a book. It's all pretty burned up. Keep it safe. I think these fellout of his pocket. You were willing to let my daughter die. Anyone leaves the island, madison dies. That's what we were told. - And you tried to leave. - We came back, all right? It doesn't matter. You don't know that! Nobody knows anything! Where is henry? We found jd. He's been killed. Well, I-I thought he was in jail. He was at the marina. Henry's taking his body to the clinic with everyone else. So, if somebody killed jd, then... then does that mean he didn't kill my dad? What the hell? -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- proudly presents -=http://sfile.ydy.com=- sync:?????? Harper's Island Season01 Episode09 - Drop it. - Hey, I got a better idea. How about you drop yours, or I'll have to wash your friend off my truck. Just... what do you want, shane? - I'm looking for jd dunn. - Jd? He's dead. don't lie to me. I saw him escape from jail earlier today. Well, he would have been better off if he'd stayed, 'cause someone sliced him open down at the marina. It's true. Jd's dead. We shouldn't be out here, man. All right. Give me that. How is he doing? - Found two pints. - Perfect. He's okay-- lost a lot of blood. Dad said the state police will be here in the morning. We can take him to a hospital then. Stay with him, okay? I couldn't save him. I tried, but... who's doing this to us? I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. When you found him, did he say anything? No. Just what he said to you. That it was about me? I asked him who did it, and... he said iwas me. Abby, you were his friend. Jd knew that. Why would he blame you? It was the last thing he said. Well, if he blamed anyone, it was me. I got to get back to the candlewick and make sure trish is okay. You... you shouldn't go by yourself. Stay with your dad. Lock the doors behind me. - Oh, my god. - What? Shea? - it's okay. - Shut up... it's not okay. Well, well. All right. Everybody move to this side of the room right now. Shane, put down the gun. Well, you didn't say the magic word. please. Get over there. I'm so, so sorry about jd. Where is everybody else? Where is the sheriff? Any news on madison? I'm sorry, shea. The state police will be here in the morning. We will find her. What do we do until then? We can't just sit here and wait. That's not a plan. Shea, somebody just killed jd. That person's still out there. Henry's right. Staying here is the only way we're going to be safe. - I think this belonged to wakefield. - What? I think it's his journal. I can still read names, words. Look. My dad's all over this thing. How did john wakefield know your dad? Actually, he... he knew my mom. I just found out. I've seen this. I mean, pages from it. They're not burnt. They fell out of jd's pocket in the other room. Okay... show me. I can'T. I gave them to henry. Thought they belonged to his brother. I need to see them. Here's an extra set of keys. I've locked all the doors in the other wings. Right now those doors are the only way in or out. Thanks, maggie. What are you doing here, shane? Looking for your brother. - I hear someone else found him first. - Don'T. Where do you get off acting so righteous? Far as I can see, all these murders started when you people showed up. For all I know... you're locking us in with the killer. So you want to be locked in here or out there? That's what I thought. Now, helusock this place up. How'd you get these? I don't know. Didn't feel it. I just saw jd on the dock and... Hey, you got some company. How's your dad? Cal thinks he's going to be okay. He and chloe stayed with him at the clinic. Good. Jimmy said he gave you some pages that fell out of jd's pocket. - Can I see them? - Uh, sure. What's that? A journal. We think it belonged to john wakefield. They're the same. They****** I will****** - "My..." - what? Abby. My... my mom, when she was younger, sh... she had an affair with wakefield. Sarah****** they had a child together? Abby, this doesn't mean anything. - Abby, you don't know what... - she had a child with him. I could be john wakefield's daughter. Look, it doesn't mean anything. It's all because of her. I don't know. Give me a sec. Hey, what aryou guys talking about? - Oh, you know. - No, I don'T. Come on, man, it's out of theag. I just heard. Abby is wakefield's kid. Let's get on your boat and get the hell out of here. Let's go to canada maybe. You're such an ass. She's going to get you killed. Yeah, but what does that mean, she's wakefield's kid? I don't know, but it can't be good. You don't believe that, do you, that abby's involved with any of this? We'll stay in here until the cops come in the morning. You son of a bitch! That's henry. Hey, don't shoot the messenger, man. It's not like I'm rosemary's baby. Look, you want to blame somebody, blame her. - Hey, you don't get to talk about abby. - Really? What about the journal that says her mom got knocked upby wakefield? - Can I talk about that? - Shut up, shane. What? Seven years, everything's cool on this island. Abby shows up, people start dying like flies. - You do the math. - That's enough. It is kind of weird. Sully. Why are you defending her? Your brother's dead. You-- your dad, your friends. I lost kelly. They all connect to her. Shea. there you are. Hi, um, should you be in here? I think it would be safer with everyone else. I just want my daughter back. Of course you do. I can't just sit here and do nothing. It's going to be okay. Get away from me. You ruined everything. You stole my husband! Where do you get off coming to me and acting like you care? You may not believe this, but I love madison very much. You don't get to love her. What happened between richard and i was never meant to hurt you. Get out. Get out! We need to get back inside. What if it's true? What if wakefield really is my father? So what? It doesn't change anything. How can you say that? Look, abby, you need to get back inside. The day I got here, I got a phone call. Somebody playing music. I thought it was a wrong number. Then, after trish's dad was killed, I got the same call again. Then somebody was in my hotel room. They taped an article about my mom's death to the mirror. Why didn't you tell me about this earlier? I was hoping it was a sick joke, but... now... after reading this journal and... all this death... it's me. Whoever is doing this wants me. Well, they can't have you. You saved him. I think he'soing to be just fine. No, it's not that. It's just... I've never seen you save someone before. That's because usually the things I dissect are already dead. I know. Brains. You realize that most people don't find neuroanatomy an aphrodisiac. Don't make fun of me. I don't know, it's just all this stuff. I can'T... it's okay. It's actually a form of post-traumatic stress. Sometimes after a life - threatening experience, the brain has this sudden urge for intimacy. Where are we going? let us in, shane. That chick's like the plague, man. Shane! You can come in, but not her. Guys, enough. - come on, shane. - Henry. Shane. Henry, henry! hey, come on. That's enough, guys. - Henry! - Stop it. - Stop it! - Henry. You see what she does? Where's beth? Beth? Dude, there's blood. Hey, beth. beth, open up. Hey, it's us. On three. One, two, three. sully. What happened? - There's blood, and beth is gone. - Look. You see that? The inn was built during prohibition. I had no idea there were tunnels. Beth's my friend. I should go with you. No, let us do this. Stay with your sister. Keep her safe. - What if it's a trap? - What if she's alive? You're right. Okay. - You know how to use this, right? - Yeah. My dad taught me. Be careful. - I love you. - We're going, too. Is that a good idea? No, but somebody's got to watch your ass. We'll find her. Hey, trish. They go looking for your friend? Sorry about your dad. You want a drink? Have you seen shea? What? You know how worried she's been about madison. I was just trying to help. This is from my bachelorette party. - Karena. - The psychic. Did you find her? We have to go get her. No, no, we're not going anywhere. There's a killer out there. He's right. We can go in the morning when the police get here. We can't be walking out there alone at night. Yeah. Yeah, I guess you're right. my truck. Oh, this is bad. How far do you think these tunnels go? If it was built for prohibition, it could go all the way to the ocean. Well, that explains how he gets around. Kidnap, kill, cut the power, all without being seen or heard. Who the hell is stalking us, and why? Thought that journal answered the question. Hey, what are you saying? Someone's pretending to be wakefield, right? It's probably someone close to him. Are you saying it's me? That I'm doing this? You're the one with his blood running through your veins. Then, why'd you come down here, sully? Are you afraid of me? Come on. Blood goes this way. Yeah. This way, too. We should split up. Beth is down here somewhere. You know, there's no version of this that ends well. - I'll go this way. - I'll take this one. Abby can go with you guys. So, you're like, uh... one of the bridesmaids? I'm trish's stepmom. So, you're like a trophy wife? I was. Right. So, did he leave you, like, a zillion dollars? Shane pierce! What do you think you're doing? I'm carving my name. What, you really think anyone's ever going to stay here again? shea? Shea, get in the truck. Go back to the hotel, trish. I know where you're going. The psychic can't tell you where madison is. - I can't stop looking. - I know. And we won'T... okay? But a psychic isn't going to be able to tell you... the minute I stop looking, madison's dead. Okay, let's go. Come on. I can't believe you, man. - I'm down here, aren't I? - You know what I'm saying. Who cares if abby's dad's a big freak? It's abner. You've been trying to sleep with her for years. Hell, you've known her long than you've known me. Look, I'm not saying she's evil or anything. But you got to admit, there is something about her being on this island that's getting people killed. What if he knew? Who we talking about? What if my dad knew I was wakefield's kid? - Abby. - Well, it explains a lot. I mean, why my dad was so angry after my mom was killed, why he sent me away. He was afraid I'd find out. Never made sense until now. If it's true, he's doing it to protect you. That's what matters. Doesn't get us any closer to finding out who did this. Looks like this is the end. Where do you think that goes? Probably someplace even worse than here. What is that? This is too small. We're going to have to find another way around. I bet I could fit. None of us are going in there. You don't have to prove anything to us. I know. There is no way I'm going in there. Hold my gun. you see anything? Some more blood. Wait... wait. There's another tunnel. Yeah? Oh, my god, oh, my god! Oh, my god! What, what is it? - It's beth, she'S... - dead? Oh, god. Be careful. What do you see? Abby? abby... abby? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Abby, hang on, we'll get you out of there. There's another tunnel up here. We've got to get some tools. Abby, are you gonna be all right until we get back? Yeah. I'll keep looking for beth. What? No, no, you stay here. We'll be right back. henry? Jimmy? madison. - Hi, abby. - Hey, sweetie. come on. We're getting out of here. Hey, don't move! Don't move! W-whoa, it's us. Where's abby? A gate came down, separated us. We need to get some tools to get her out. We, uh... we found beth. How'd it-- what happened? He cut her up, stuffed her in a crawlspace. We're going to get out of here. I promise. Look. Looks like we're climbing. You okay? abby's trapped. We need tools to get her free. Shane, you still keep your tools in your truck, right? Yeah... but my truck's not here. Your girl stole it. Trish? You let her leave? Where did she go? The sun's coming up. The state police will be here and they'll help us find madison. It's going to be okay. - any luck? - It's too heavy. Can you see anything? Just the sky. Wait, I see lights. I think it's a car. Hello! Hello! Here, try waving the flashlight. use your hand. - hello! - Hello! - Hello! - Somebody help us, please! - Stop, we're down here! - Anybody, can you hear us? - Hello! - Use your hand. Can you hear us? We're down here! Trish, stop the truck. Hello! Somebody help us! - Madison! - Please! Hello! - Madison. - Mommy. it's trish and abby. - Is she okay? - I think so. You didn't find beth? She was down in the tunnel. We were too late. We are so happy to see you, honey. Where have you been? She's still a little overwhelmed. We're going to wait to talk to the sheriff. Yes, yes. Thank god. Hey, stepmom, you're missing the big reunion. You hear me? The kid's back. - Did you like the game? - What? The game. He said you'd like it. The man who took me. What man, madison? Your dad, abby. You know, the sheriff.
