All right, listen up, folks. I'm very sorry for your loss. I know you all have a lot of questions, And I'm going to work Very hard to answer them, but right now, I think it's very important that you get back to the Candlewick. Maggie? Henry, if you will help Make sure everyone gets back there And stays put, I would appreciate it. I'd recommend you all stay together. This is no time For anyone to be off on their own. I will be back there To talk to you as soon as I can. Hello? â™ª Ave Maria... Haparper's Island S01E06 sync and corrections by aydin1954 for addic7ed.com thanks to YYeTs.net for the transcript One by one. What the hell was that thing? I don't know... A sword, maybe. I mean, is there any chance It could have been a part of the chandelier? You mean like an accident? No way. You see what it did to Trish's dad? Somebody did that on purpose. Dude, that could have been Any one of us under that. I've never seen a dead body before. I have. Dude. It's going to be okay. How is it going to be okay? Mr. Wellington is dead. Trish is never going... I just want to go home. So, I guess the wedding is... yeah. Yeah, they'll probably postpone it or something. I bet we're all on a boat in the morning. No, if someone did that on purpose... We should leave here right now. Damn jacket contaminated the crime scene. To tell you the truth, I'm glad it's there. I'm in no hurry to see what's under it. Not after finding those pieces of reverend fain In the lake like that. Lord, not another one. I think this explains Why the reverend was killed. Whoever did this probably killed the reverend 'Cause he needed the church empty. This took a long time to set up. Make sure you try and pull prints off of everything. And I want lots of pictures, too. We got another killer on this island. I can tell that. You know what I mean. The reverend hacked to pieces, this man nearly split in half. Don't pretend that you don't recognize That weapon. This has John Wakefield written all over it. Wakefield is dead. Well, then, somebody is doing One hell of a job imitating him. Guy knew what he was doing. Looks like he rigged a trip wire to the light switch. Flick the switch and... Fire the head spade. Pretty fancy way to kill somebody. Fancy or random? Could have hit anybody. The lights were turned off When the unity candles were lit. You think that the killer knew this? Yep. And who stood where. Somebody wanted Thomas Wellington dead. Here, honey. This always makes you feel better. Hmm? Hi. Just wanted to see... I'll be right back. How's Trish? She hasn't said a word since we got back. I don't know what to do. You don't have to do anything. Just be there. Yeah... Just everything about this day... This afternoon, before the rehearsal, JD and I got into a fight. I told him to leave. He just smiled And said he had one last "surprise" for me. You think he did that to Trish's dad? JD? I was supposed to be getting married. I'm scared. I did say we might be becalmed. Becalmed? Stranded. Without wind. It's a sailing term. Oh, I thought it meant "relaxed." If I'd known it would cause you To be late for the rehearsal, I'd never have suggested the voyage. It's just a rehearsal--it's fine. I had a lovely time. We just need to call Trish And tell her we're on our way. I'll find the pay phone. You just becalm yourself right here. To love and to destiny. To love and to destiny! Yo, earl grey. What's going on? Can I get you a drink? What's the excitement? Crazy story. You see that couple? Brett and Lisa--they've been On and off for years. I mean, they fight, break up, Get back together. Then, this morning, They were just walking along the beach, And Brett found a diamond ring in the sand. He took it as a sign, Proposed on the spot, and Lisa said yes. They found a ring? That's my ring. Abby, Abby, it's okay, it's just me. It's just me. You broke into my room? I'm sorry, I-I didn't... I needed to talk. Does Henry think I killed Wellington? Nobody knows what to think. This is bad. You know, it was just a roman candle Firecracker. My surprise--this thing I told Henry. I put a roman candle in the unity candle. You know, I thought it'd be funny Just to piss Henry off. Abby, I need your help. W-- Remember what you said to Shane When he had me tied up, about John Wakefield being alive? I-I made that up, Trying to help you. What if you were right? What if he is alive? H-he's not. I-it was a story. I think I saw him. Today Outside of the church. That's impossible. My dad killed him. Look, I know it sounds crazy. But then I found something. I can show you. JD. Abby. I didn't kill Wellington. I'm afraid that no one else is going to believe me. Please? Look, I need your help. The sheriff's on his way over To talk to us. Does he know anything? I'm not sure, But... Before he gets here, let's all just... Take a deep breath. Okay, we're all upset. But no matter what happens, let's not forget we have Each other. We are a family And we will get through this. No, we won't. Trish, it may not seem Like that right now. Shut up, Richard. Trish. Not... Another word. Madison's trying to sleep. You lying, cheating Son of a bitch! Daddy knew; he knew You betrayed him. Richard... What is she talking about? He's cheating on you, Shea. With her. Excuse me. I have some questions To ask about what happened this afternoon. Maybe I should start with you. It was like the universe was telling me to fish or cut bait. Got down on one knee. It was amazing. Afternoon. Cal Vandeusen. How you doing? I heard the good news. Felicitations. Yeah. There's no easy way to say this, So I'll just jump right in. The ring you found belongs to me. I lost it a few days ago on the beach. I sense your skepticism. "Prove it," you may say. "Gladly," I retort. First of all, the diamond is 1.5 karats. Second, the... Color rating is an "H," Which, you might not know, Means it's virtually colorless, And, finally, the clarity rating is a VVS1. It's an impressive statistic That any jeweler could verify, so... I'm not getting my ring back, am I? What the hell was that? Trish, it's Chloe. Um... I guess I'll try back later. I got her voice mail again. What's the matter, sweetie? You remember our first night here, When you threw my trousers in the ocean? We've talked about that. True. However, when we discussed it, I left out the niggling detail... That there was a ring In the pocket that got washed away. A ring? For me? Like... The kind of ring you would give someone when you're going To ask them to ma... yeah. Really? That is so romantic. Evidently, they agree. That... dude found the ring and... Proposed then and there. With the ring you were going to give me? I don't think so. JD, you need to tell me where we're going. Look, I told you, I saw a guy who looked like Wakefield Outside the church. I followed him. I have proof. Come on, he's right up here. I'll show you. It's here. JD. There. Oh, my God. Is it...? JD, don't. I needed to see who this was with somebody I could trust. This doesn't prove anything. Oh, God, it's uncle Marty. Oh. Madison's asleep. Shea... I am so sorry. That is not How I wanted you to find out. I always thought our marriage was a rock. Richard? I mean, I actually thought that he loved me. So you had no idea? That's the frightening part. We had fun together. Great sex. It's like learning I've been married to dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Please tell me daddy didn't know. I told daddy this morning. So his last day on earth, He finds out his wife is cheating on him With his daughter's husband. It's too horrible to think about. And daddy was so good to Richard, So generous. Thomas Wellington was a, uh, Difficult man. You worked for him, what...? Nearly 13 years. Been married to Shea for 12. How long have you been involved With Katherine Wellington? Six weeks. It just kind of happened. Fell on her, did you? I knew what I was doing. I know it sounds awful, But it was my way of... getting back at Wellington. For what? You'd have to work For him... to understand. Try me. I hated him, if that's what you're asking. His wife feel the same way? You'd have to ask her yourself. We don't talk much. I just... Wanted to humiliate him. I didn't kill him. Where were you today before the wedding rehearsal? With my daughter Madison. We spent the day together. Do you know anything about what happened here seven years ago? The Wakefield murders? That's right. Just the basics. Guy went on a rampage, killed a bunch of people. Why? Thanks for talking to me. Appreciate the candor. Where have you been? What's wrong? God, Henry. It's uncle Marty. What about him? No. No. I saw him, Henry. He's dead. I'm... I'm so sorry. Show me. No. Abby, show me; I want to see it. I need to know what's happening. I think Wakefield's back. That's what's happening. JD was the one who found uncle Marty. You... you did this! Henry, wait! Stop it, stop it, both of you! Henry, please. You did this! Get off him! Both of you, stop! You always hated him! I knew he wouldn't believe me. Henry, he was as surprised as me. Uncle Marty was strung up in a tree. It was awful. It has to be Wakefield. Or a copycat. There's something you need to see. How could you? After everything That I've done for you, This is how you repay me? Oh, Chloe, I love you. Oh, Chloe, you're the only one Who makes me feel like a man." Well, you're a liar And a cheat! Who are you? Who are you, you son of a bitch! Aah! Brett! Oh... ...and just so you know... It is your baby. You bastard! Lisa. Lisa! Lisa! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Go, go, go, go, go. Hey, it's me again, Lucy. Um... can you call me? I just need to hear your voice and know you're okay. Or a text message or something, okay? Lucy's, uh, back in Seattle, right, with some dude? That's what everyone keeps saying, But nobody seems to know for sure. I left her, like, five messages. Maybe she's having a great time. You know, with... with that guy. I mean... love can do that. I hope so. You guys heard from Booth yet? Yeah, he... he had to go home. He's so lucky not to be here for this. I hate this island. And after breakfast? Dad and I went to the pool. I wore my blue bathing suit 'Cause my green one was still wet. You like to swim? Yeah. But daddy burns easy, so we couldn't stay long. And then what? Then, we went to the rec room And played ping-pong until it was time to get ready. That's a lot of ping-pong. I'm very good. I can see that. Well, thank you, Madison. Ladies. Honey, are you okay? Do you want to lie down for a little while? No, thank you-- I'm not sleepy. Did I do good? Will daddy be proud of me? Why? What do you mean? I told the sheriff Exactly what daddy told me to say. Does your dad know you've been up here? I don't understand. It's like a shrine. Why does he have these? I don't think my dad believed that Kelly killed herself. I don't, either. Look, I'm telling you, it was Wakefield. Man, he's doing all of this. No, I think My dad's been tracking a Wakefield copycat for years. Wouldn't it be easier Just to ask him? There have been No murders on this island for seven years. Meanwhile, he's tracking deaths All over the Pacific Northwest That remind him of Wakefield. So, he's obsessed. You can't really blame him. But now there are Wakefield-style murders Here on the island. So, you're saying, whoever did these... Also killed uncle Marty and Mr. Wellington. But why now? Why, after all these years? Okay, that's creepy. What was he lying about? Check this out. Hmm? This is impossible. This is from the summer. What if my dad's not tracking a copycat? What if he's tracking Wakefield? You sure? No boots were left? Well, tell the harbormaster... keep an eye out. Anybody comes or goes, I want to know. There's another body, dad. It's my uncle Marty. Where? The woods off of east road. Okay. I'll get right on it. I'll send a deputy out there now. He was cut in two, hanging in a tree. Sound familiar? What's your point, JD? His point is, my uncle might still be breathing If you'd have told us Wakefield was alive. And so would Kelly Seaver. John Wakefield is dead. I shot and killed him seven years ago. You know that. You went into my... There's a copycat. I thought that man might be him. I don't believe you. There's a way to find out the truth. What are you talking about? If Wakefield is dead and buried, We can prove it. We'll dig him up. We're not digging up anybody. This day's hard enough without this kind of behavior. Yeah, you'd like that. But I think Wakefield is still alive. I bet, if I dug up That grave, I'd find an empty box. Should we find out once and for all Who the real liar around here is? I've heard enough from you. You should have never left the hotel In the first place, let alone pry Into my office. I'm digging up Wakefield... With or without your permission. I'm sorry, JD. There's too much at stake here To let you interfere with my investigation. You two, get inside. Consider it a time out. Was it worth it, sheriff? Huh? pretending that Wakefield was dead So that you could be a hero? Where were you this morning, JD, When that contraption was set up That killed Mr. Wellington? Odd coincidence, isn't it? You finding your uncle hanging, Just like Kelly Seaver? You being the last one to see her and all. I liked Kelly. You're locking up the wrong guy. Wakefield's still out there! Dad, I need to know the truth. I'm getting you off this island tomorrow. It's open. Oh. I wasn't expecting you. I saw your face... After my father... I could tell that you were upset. What do you want? I loved your father. I have done some Foolish things, but I wouldn't kill him. Then why did Richard lie About where he was this morning? I don't know. He told Madison to lie to the sheriff, Say that he was with her. Well, he wasn't with me, if that's what you're asking. Well, then, where was he? My dad's lying about Wakefield. I can feel it. I know. Did you see how he reacted When JD talked about digging up the grave? John Wakefield murdered my mother, ruined my life. If my dad's been lying all these years, If he didn't kill Wakefield, I need to know. The grave. That's the only way. ...you tell me, all right... ...because that was amazing. Well, I do get away with a lot of things. Yeah... Thank God you're okay. Uh... Why wouldn't I be okay? That's dreadful. Sounds like it could have been any of you. That's what I said. Are you sure it was a head spade? Oh, here we go. That's not Why I asked. Remember on the scavenger hunt? There was a head spade missing from the maritime museum. God, this is terrible. The sheriff doesn't want Anyone leaving until he talks to us all. Nobody's going anywhere. Does he suspect someone In the wedding party? Well, maybe keeping us all cooped up here Isn't just for our protection. I never thought of it like that. Well, I'm not sleeping tonight. Richard would fantasize About it-- Thomas dying. How he would take over the company And run it like it should be run. Any specific threats? No, just jokes. He didn't really mean it. Can you just Show him the articles that you found? Richard left his briefcase in my room yesterday. It's where he keeps the things we use. I found these inside. Did Richard talk much about John Wakefield? No, never. That's why I didn't think anything of it until today. Thank you, Mrs. Wellington. He used Wakefield as a cover to kill my father, didn't he? I don't know, And until I do, I need you to remain calm And to keep this to yourself. Both of you. Wow. How'd you know I was in here? I hear things. Can I try? Yeah. How'd you get the key? Maggie keeps it in a drawer. Nobody pays attention to kids. Some people think My dad killed my grandpa. I'm sorry to hear that. I-I'll see you later. You promise? Abby. Abby. I expected to find JD here. Didn't think I'd see you two. I thought you locked him up. Somebody let him out. I'm sorry, dad. But I need to know if there's a body in there. I won't stop you. I thought there was a Wakefield copycat for years Just never imagined he'd come to the island. Could that be who JD saw outside the church? Maybe... or he didn't see anybody. That could have been a lie. Then why come to me? Why take me to see uncle Marty? So he'd look innocent. I don't know... Well, whoever's committing these murders-- I think they're pretending to be Wakefield To hide their true motive. I'm sorry I went through your things. Your mother was a snoop. Runs in the blood. I shouldn't have doubted you. I gave you a lot of reason. I sent you away after your mother died, and I know That hurt you... a lot. But you have to understand that... It wasn't because I didn't want you there. It was because I didn't want you to see me like that-- Broken, weak. Don't you think I was feeling the same way? And those things I said to you back then-- About your mother-- That was in a moment of anger. Will you forgive me? Thank you. Well, we need to finish up here and then... We'll get you two back to the Candlewick And then, tomorrow... ...we'll send you all home. What about JD? I'm sorry, Henry, but... I'm going to have to bring him in. Cal, can you come in here, please? Mm-hmm. What'd you do with the ring? The ring. Not to worry, it's safe and sound. It's so romantic-- That couple finding it on the beach And proposing on the spot like that. Becalm yourself, my dear. I know you want me to be more impetuous. Oh, about that... I'm sorry I've been so critical. I think you scare me sometimes-- That you care enough to think of everything. It's because I adore you. But the ring... Is actually the one thing I hadn't thought through. I don't want to disappoint you, But I'm not going to propose to you On the same day Trish lost her father. But you are going to? Of course I am. I'm crazy for you. Just not today. I have not been charged With anything, But I am not saying another word without you present. Now, the sheriff is going to be coming back in the morning, And I will refer him to your office. More importantly, I don't know what Shea is going to do. She's pretty pissed. No, I don't care about The money, okay? But I want you to fight for shared... Madison...
