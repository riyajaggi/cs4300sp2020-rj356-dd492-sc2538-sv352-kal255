 Basu. These documents, they're authentic, right? Why will I give you false information? Especially when... You know. But if Patil finds out that I gave you this file... Relax, Basu. Nothing will go wrong. Do you know why? Because Bhaisaab doesn't know I'm coming for him. And by the time he finds out, there won't be any Bhaisaab.

 The ICB will be in your capable hands. It better be. Thank you, Basu. Now get out of my car. You can't deny it anymore, can you? What is this? There was an attempt to switch the urine sample with another one, which obviously made us curious. So we did a test as soon as we could. And it came positive with two PEDs. And you look mighty pleased. All I know is that now we have solid evidence that the PPL players are doping. And that you and your Indian Cricket Board must take action. Are you trying to tell me how to run my league?

 Your league? Interesting. No. I'm merely spelling out protocol. Appropriate action will be taken. Thank you for coming. Mr. Munawar, looks like your new cricket league is all set to leave the PPL behind. God willing, that's what we are aiming for, sir, that our league will grow to be an excellent platform for Pakistan's cricketers. We just need support from sponsors like you. Actually, I'm not here as a sponsor. I need some information from you. -What do you mean? -I mean... Are you betraying your country? It's not a secret that... ...Pakistan Cricket is broke right now. You cannot build such a huge league on your own. In fact, your security situation is so bad that your own matches are being played in Sharjah instead of Pakistan. Solution? A secret business deal between Pakistan Cricket and ICB. ICB will fund your league, and obviously, this league will become very popular in Pakistan. Both of you will mint money. Look, this proposal did not progress from the proposal stage. This proposal was rejected, last year. I know. But now, in just three months, your league will start. If you didn't have money then, how do you have it now? What are you talking about, sir? Our league has many sponsors. Like, K2 Telecom... K2 Telecom. K2 Telecom is in a debt of 150 crores. You have only one true sponsor, and he's Indian. This news will be leaked to the media at Lahore and Karachi. Please don't say that. Did you wonder why I approached the Vice President of Pakistan Cricket instead of the President? Amidst all the confusion, if the media names you today, your career will be over. But if they name the president instead of you, then you will have his chair. Mr. Munawar, it would be wise to accept my offer right now. I take good care of my friends. All you need to do is tell me who is funding you from India? -Okay, I better leave. -Yeah. Otherwise, the press will again start the conflict of interest chorus. You should go and sit in the Mavericks box. No, I'll go out and stand with the fans. -But... -Don't worry, Mantra, I'll do it. Zarina? Hello. Such a nice surprise. I thought you were busy with your shoot. I was. But then I thought that my team needs me more. It's high time we win. Well, we'll go out together. It'll be great. Oh, no, no, no, darling, you deserve a break. You relax in the AC room. I'll go and sweat it out in the stands. Isn't it? See you. I'll see you later, too. Bye. Once again, the Mavericks' bowlers have disappointed. Once again, it's down to their batsmen to make light of the chase. They need about ten an over from here on, but they've got nine wickets in hand. And if you go by those sixes, Vayu and TJ should steer them home. The PowerPlay is over, but that doesn't stop TJ. He smokes another one into the stands. That's his third six of the match. Vayu has hit two sixes as well. Best start the Mavericks have had this season. And look, Zarina Malik is back in the stands. The fans must've missed her in the first two matches, and it seems even her players are trying to impress her. It's raining sixes here! And it looks like Vayu and TJ are competing with each other to be the sixer king of this match. Blitzers' captain Adams is setting the field. And here comes the last ball. And he swung it up in the air! But Vayu's innings will come to an end, because his timing went down the drain. The last ball flew right into the long-on's hands. Fuck! TJ, he needs to get the Mavericks home. If you had to choose in these South African conditions, you'd surely pick the local lad. And TJ the DJ hit it high in the air again, six! There was no forecast of rain today. But it rained. TJ's bat made it rain fours and sixes. Only four more runs needed from eleven balls. And once again, TJ hits a six with his classic lazy elegance. And that brings Mavericks their first win. The dugout is going wild with excitement. And angry Mavericks fans finally get a win. Captain Vayu Raghavan is also celebrating this win. So, Zarina, welcome back. You arrived and Mumbai Mavericks won their first match. So I suppose you are their lucky charm? It's my privilege to be able to support the Mavericks. I'm really happy to be here. Okay, Zarina, very important question. Who is your favorite batsman now? Is it Vayu or TJ? You know I can't answer that, Sohail. Don't try to create problems for me. All right. So that was Zarina Malik. And back to the studio. Zarina. -Welcome to South Africa. -Thank you. Congrats on the win. Thank you. They're saying you're the lucky charm. Zarina, about the team selection... Like I said, I can take some suggestions of the team management. But the final call has to be mine. I understand. I'll have a word with them. Okay? Fuck. But you're still playing on your front foot. Always have. Always will. A total score of 156 in 13 innings overall. It's time to admit that your natural game doesn't work here, Vayu. Look, it's just bad luck, okay? Get on your back foot, Vayu. Are you saying this? Or him? He's not your enemy, you know. -Whatever you have achieved today... -Yeah, it's because of him. I know. So should I worship him? -Respect. -Oh, fuck off, man! You fuck off! If Mukund Pansare hadn't taken us under his wings, God knows where we would've been today. We might have been out on the streets begging like other orphans. -So please be grateful. -Is that so? And what about what he did? He never apologized, Rohini. Not once. Never. Look at him. He's been chasing me all day. He's your fan. And he wants you to see him bat in the nets. You want me to bowl to him? You reckon he's up to it? Yeah. Hey, kid. You last more than three balls, I'll buy your first drink. Come on, Parth, come on! Are you nervous? It doesn't matter who the bowler is. Or who is watching. You got to back yourself, okay? You have all the shots in the book. Shot selection must be right. Go for it, Banks. That's it, that's it, Parth! Well done, Parth. Well done! Fuck! Banks. Your batting's shit, your bowling's shit and now the new boy is smashing you everywhere. Miroslav, you motherfucker! Banks has lost his mind. Is it because of the drugs? Is it... Drug... -Translate it. -Yes, sir. Did Banks get angry because of PEDs? Yes, well, it is possible. Possible? Sir, he means that could be the reason. I know, man. I will fix the dosage. He's saying, sir, that he'll change the dosage. Isn't it too late for that? Isn't it too late now, you bastard! Now it's too late, isn't it... Sir, should I translate "bastard" as well? The only way we can move forward with this is if we drop Prashant from the next match right away. No! There's no rocket science to it, his fitness and form, both are out of place. I mean, he's just not at the level the team needs him to be... -Moses, sir? -I said no... Rohini. Hi. Come join us. No, I can come back later, that's fine. No, it's okay, we'd like to hear your opinion. I don't think that's a... Rohini. It's important. I need to hear your take. Please, sit. Okay. Vayu, calm down. Moses, we've got a psychological evaluation and the doctor had cleared him to play, so... Look, we can't give him special treatment. The entire team's morale is down because of him. And his performance, I mean, just look at the way he's bowling. Okay, so what do you wanna do? I want that we drop him from the next match. And until he performs well in practice, we don't take him back! You know, Arvind made the same mistake. Just practice, practice, practice. Then he played the match and the whole world witnessed his talent, okay? So cut this practice crap -and let's just fucking... -Vayu. Okay, look. All I'm saying is that we let him bowl himself back to form, okay? Batsmen do it all the time, right? So why not bowlers? Shall we talk about your form, then? Guys, guys. This argument won't get us anywhere. We need to find a better way to reach a decision. -I say we look at... -I say we vote. -What? -What? What kind of vote? This is so silly, you can't vote for these things, man! Why not? We're all part of team management and it's a good way to make decisions. Yeah. Why not? Let's vote. Let's see how it goes. Okay. All those in favor of dropping Prashant from the team? This is incredibly stupid. After everything I did for you last season. Fine. It doesn't matter. It's you and him, versus me, Mantra, and... What the fuck? Based on his current form, I just don't think he should be... You weren't even supposed to be in this meeting! You're just trying to hurt me, you little... -Hey! -Hey! The decision has been made, all right? Oh, no. No decision has been made. I am the captain of this team, and I decide who plays and who doesn't, okay? -Vayu, we decided we... -I'm done begging. -You either listen to me or... -Vayu, this is no way to talk with... -Or what? -You better not say a word! It's a fuckload of crap, and I'm done with this nonsense. Make your own fucking team and play, bastards! Sorry. I just need to take this. -Excuse me. -Sure. Hello? Yeah? Hello. He's broken his nose and lost quite a bit of blood, but he'll be fine. It's gonna take a couple of months for him to completely heal, though. Yeah. I'm sorry, but I don't think he should play the rest of the tournament. Can I go and see him? Yeah, go. Wrong shot selection. Hey, Skip. Just thought I'd come see, you know, how the little man was doing. -Yeah, come. -Thanks. Oh, fuck. Hey, buddy. How you doing? If you'd feel better, I'd... Can't wait to bowl at you again. Oh, fuck, I'm sorry. Look, do you want anything? Do you want anything? I can go... I can help. I can go get something... I'm happy to help, you know. I can... Look... I wanna say I didn't... I don't know what came over me, mate. It's not... That's not me. I'm not usually this angry. I promise... I just got worked up, and I didn't mean for it to happen. It just somehow... I don't... You hit me, and... Basically, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It happened in the heat of the moment, it's fine. Yeah, I know. I know it happened in the heat of the moment. That's what I'm saying. I said that it... I'll just leave you both be. You know, it's best if I just... Feel better. I hope you feel better, dude. Go away. -I need to talk to you. -I said go away. I said I need to talk to you. What is it? He's dying. Finally. -I'm going to India. -What? He's dying, Vayu. I won't ask you to come with me, but... Excuse me. Come with you? Are you fucking kidding me? You aren't going either. I am. Do as you please. But you better think it through. Bye, Vayu. Hey, what's Vayu's average this season? Man, it's around 16, 17. -Seriously? -Yeah. How the mighty have fallen. I know, right? Gentlemen, what is this? The article you wanted us to write. It is a poor excuse for an article. You have not published the name of the player, the team, nothing. "A player has tested positive for Performance Enhancing..." Here you say, "The tests are proved to be not conclusive." I gave you the tip that would've made your careers. Listen, I thank you for the story you gave us. And we did what we could. If we start publishing the names of the players, that will be the end of our jobs. Excuse us, please. Mr. Hummels. Well played, Mr. Patil, in keeping Sooraj Chaudhary's name out of the newspapers. But I will get him. I have sent his B sample for testing. You mean this one? B Sample Report You forged the report. I merely resolved the matter. This is just one player. There are many others like him. In this game, you are the batsman and I am the bowler. And you can hit all the sixes you want, Mr. Patil. But all I need to get you is just one mistake. Impressive analogy. And here I thought you didn't like cricket. But here's the thing. You had your shot, and you failed. I wonder... Is this your love of the game that allows you, that drives you to protect cheats and frauds? Do you even know what you're protecting, Mr. Patil? Bhaisaab, they called. Plane is ready. Mr. Hummels... I'm protecting a dream. The dream that every young boy and girl watches every night on their TV sets all around the world. They see their favorite players, they want to be like them. They want to play in the PPL. Do great, wonderful, unimaginable things. You see, unlike you, I'm protecting those children from Sooraj Chaudhary. Because if they get to know your truth about him... No, Mr. Hummels. I will not let you kill the dreams of these children. And I can't let you kill the game. Yes, Bhaisaab? It's done. Oh, wow! Thank you, thank you, Bhaisaab. By the way, how much did you have to pay Hummels? I didn't bribe Hummels. Who did you bribe, then? His entire lab. Then what about Hummels? Mr. Hummels will be sent to Mexico. For their table tennis team. Brilliant! Brilliant, Bhaisaab. Thank you. Thank you, Bhaisaab. We are already getting offers for next year's PPL. From UK, from Canada. Zarina? What's wrong? Nothing much, Bhaisaab. These shooting locations... I mean, everything is so expensive here. And then one needs countless permissions. It's a bit of a mess, really. I have to figure it out. I think both of us need to stop thinking about work for a while. Take a break. Bhaisaab. Remember. Smile and knees high. And one, two, three, four, cross, turn, shimmy, shimmy. Good job, girls. Remember, the eyes of a billion people are going to be on you. Okay, girls, let's take five. Hey! -I'm sorry. -For? Practice, I looking. That's okay. I guess that's the point. Can I look? At you, while practicing. Okay. I barely saw the ball. -You're good. -Thank you. So, do you have any friends in Jo'burg? Friends. Vayu. Vayu Raghavan. The captain? He's a friend? But that doesn't count. So have you been sightseeing around here yet? Sightseeing? No. No? Let me take you. Why are we here? You were worried about your shooting locations, weren't you? Well, I want you to meet someone. He can help you out. Thanks, Kyle. I'll take over. Good day, Mr. Patil. Miss Zarina. I'm Reva. This way, please. Mr. President. So good to see you. The pleasure is all mine. Zarina Malik, Mr. Emershan Isaacs. The President of the Republic of South Africa. Of course, I know you. I'm a big Mavericks fan. But don't tell the press. Such an honor to meet you, President Isaacs. Zarina, I've already mentioned to the President that you're looking for some help with locations in South Africa for your film. No, you didn't... I'm so sorry. -It's just a tiny problem. -Not at all. I'd love to help Bollywood showcase the splendors of South Africa to the world. But first, I want to show off one of our greatest treasures. Please, follow me. From the site. Okay. Turn that. So, this is it. This is our famous excavation site. A girl, not quite ape, not quite homo sapien, fell down the shaft into these caves and was lying here for over three and a half million years. When we found Little Foot, she was the oldest, most complete fossil of a hominin ever found. As it turns out, she has a friend that may be even older. Would you be interested in holding a piece of human history? I... You're sure that's okay? Please, feel free to touch. Thank you. Prashant. This is bunny chow. It's a South African dish but invented by the Indians who came here. Eat with spoon? You're supposed to eat it with your hands. Do you remember when we first met? It was South Africa's tour to India, 1991. The first team tour post-apartheid. I remember because you were the one pushing the two boards. Well, after supporting the anti-apartheid movement for so long, it was India's privilege to host South Africa's first international tour. Both our people stood for truth and what is right. Through thick and thin. But I feel a sense of guilt, that we, you and I, are somehow doing disservice to the game. And to Test cricket. Do you think I don't like Test cricket? I love Test cricket, Mr. President. But it's not what I like or what you like, it is us, Mr. President. The people. The fans who watch the game. We are evolving as spectators, as players, as humans. Here we are, in the Cradle of Humankind, where it all began. Our ancestors made smart, fearless choices that helped them survive, spread across continents and evolve into us. Should we not do the same? Should the game of cricket not evolve? Do you travel lot in South Africa? Not really. I have two jobs. So I don't get that much time. Two... Second job? I'm an exotic dancer. That means I'm a stripper. Look. So, stripper means? Means exactly what you think it means, okay? I'm sorry. Listen, I know Indians are very traditional about these things. But in South Africa, nobody really cares. A job is a job. But in India, a job not job. What do you mean? I... I mean, I explain... How do I explain it? How do I explain that my future was decided even before I was born. My father was a washer man, so I was supposed to be one, too. I just got lucky, otherwise... Here, you get to choose your job, don't you? But there, our identity decides our job. What are you thinking? You once told me that I could be like you. I can take your place. I just need to change. And? Those who don't change, don't survive. Survival of the fittest. Maybe the time to evolve is now. Good night. Are you sure this is the right way to go about it? If there is one thing I've learnt from Bhaisaab, then it's this, if you want the media to know something, never leak it yourself. Let them find it. Especially if it comes from... How should I say, someone with a... Reputation? But how do we draw the media's attention to it? You know how the media manipulates the truth? Well, watch me manipulate the media. How's it going, bro? Even the military generals don't get to lay their hands on such fine liquor. Wow! It's heavenly. And you, who took me on this heavenly ride, are God. But if you'd like, I can send four, five cases of this heavenly liquor to you. You can enjoy it till next Eid. I was Pakistan's most successful coach. Those board members schemed against me, they maligned my name and sacked me in public. You're right, Mr. Sharif. They shouldn't have sacked you. It was such a low blow. And that's why I'm here. To get you a better high than this. What kind of high? Revenge. Pakistan Cricket Board will have to answer us. Why? What was the need to take funds from an Indian company? Doesn't Pakistan have enough resources to build this league on its own? But, sir, which is this company that you are speaking of? Now presenting the Swiss Ambassador to India, his excellency, Dr. Simon Muller. It is such a privilege for me and my wife Carla to be here at the opening of this exhibition. We also want to welcome Mr. Faisal Hussain who is the Home Minister of India. That, my friends, is a true art lover. A toast to Mr. Hussain. Cheers! -Cheers! -Cheers! Thank you so much for coming, Mr. Hussain. This gallery deserves more high-profile patrons. Cut the crap, Simon. I came here because I needed a place to talk to you. Your embassy's bugged and you can't be seen at my Ministry, can you? So here I am. I want you to do something for me. I need you to find out who owns and operates this Zurich account. Where does the money come from, where does it go? Names, places, the works, you know? But it's not legal. Do you know what the Research and Analysis Wing is, Simon? It's our very own intelligence agency. You know, spies... James Bond types. Usually they don't have very thick files on ambassadors, but you, you are the real deal, my man. This one here is rather... What's the word? What's the word? Well endowed. Thank you. Well endowed. And she barely looks 18. Do you have diplomatic immunity from your wife? It'll take two to three days. Tomorrow. Bye-bye, Simon. -Madam. -Good morning. Boss, you have to stop everything. This is big news. If he agrees, he can bring the whole of Maharashtra to a grinding halt within 12 hours. Sudha is in Mumbai right now. You sent Sudha to meet him all alone? Is that a problem? He is a crook, Dhawan. You don't know him well. I know Sudha. She'll get it done. Not interested. May I ask why? Why? The thing is, madam, I already have too many enemies. Why should I make more? But you'll make new friends, too. In Delhi. Don't gawk, do your work. I am doing my job, you do yours. What's the offer? The number is written in this, see for yourself. This isn't enough to even shut down Bombay. The whole of Maharashtra, forget it. You can write the number you expect. Why don't we include you in this offer? Mr. Patankar, where do you get this confidence from? Your party has only one MLA in the Legislative Assembly. Neither does your party have funds, nor a mass base. And what was the issue your party campaigned for in the last elections? Yeah. Toll booths. At this rate, your party will be over and out by the next elections. So, cut this crap. And shake hands with me. What's wrong, Yash? Here's some breaking news for you. We've just received word that an Indian company... ...sponsored Pakistan's T-20 league. And the leader of Marathi Asmita Party, Bhalerao Patankar and his supporters are staging a protest here today. Mr. Patankar, what do you know about this? The company that funded Pakistan League belongs to Yashwardhan Patil. And we want an inquiry into this matter! Our soldiers are dying every day at the border and this man, Patil, he's cutting business deals with the enemy? We won't spare him. Throw the bastard in jail. Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you! Yashwardhan Patil! Shame on you!
