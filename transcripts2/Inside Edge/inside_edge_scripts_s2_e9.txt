 Look at these assholes. Whichever country it may be, our players, these bloody fuckers land up in the jail. Sir, actually-- And people like us come and bail them out. It's done, sir. Yeah, Zarina. Yeah, an officer, someone called Temba Gandu, we are waiting in his room. -Zondo, sir. -Zondu, Zondu, yeah. Zondo. Did you get it done? Okay. Yes, yes.

 He's here. I think he's talking to the mayor. I'll call you later. Yes. Yes. I am sorry. I understand. Yes, today. Tonight, of course. I apologize. You release them now? What? No! Those two idiots could have gotten themselves killed. They're staying right here. Were you talking to the mayor right now?

 No. That was my wife. Mr. Temba... Jhandhu... It's Zondo. Zondo, sir. Zondu... South Africa, Indian, both bro-bro. Brothers. Brothers. This news going out... Both... Both the countries becoming bad. Do you have any idea how bad this could have been? I'm sorry. What else can I do? Apologize, sir. Apologize. Tomorrow, in court. Hello, sir. Yes, sir. Well, it seems your string-pulling has worked. That was the mayor. It's been taken care of, sir. Come on. We, sir, both going other side. You do the paperwork. -Let's go. -Yeah. -You go home, gentlemen. -What? The paperwork can only be done in the morning. Bhaisaab. Where are we on the votes, Ayesha? How many confirmed till now? Bhaisaab, I tried my best... How many? I've tried everything. I dug out the history, geography of every association. Ayesha! Four. Hello? Hello, Bhaisaab? I'm here. I know you needed six. Seems like Basu has been planning this for a very long time. And with the limited time we have... You just have to buy those votes. Just pay the associations whatever money they want. It's your time to make the payment. Because of your stupidity, I might lose my ICB to someone else. You messed with me in the PPL. Bhaisaab, it's... By the way, are you wearing your seatbelt? No, I'm sitting at the back. Put it on. Next time, there won't be a warning. Finally scored a girl, that too a stripper, eh? Bravo, my man. But there's no point in her marrying a washer man. When she doesn't wear anything, what will she need washed! Hey, tell me this. Oh, fuck! Hello, you aren't running low on detergent, are you? Did you have sex with her yet? Seriously, man! You desperately need it, asshole! Hello, brother? Water! You fucking black guy, water! Motherfucker. What are you up to? She's a white girl... -She'll go all out... -Don't touch... Hey, stop that! Get in. In. All right, all right. Hey, guard. Hey. I don't want these brown bums in my cell, you hear me? Hey, Ronnie, what're these two curry munchin' faggots doing here, huh? Stinkin' the whole place up! I want you two Paki fuckers to go sit near the toilet. Maybe you'll start to smell a little nicer. Do I need to speak to you separately? You understand English? Yes, yes. Listen, there is a mistake... I suggest you back off, else you'll get beaten to a pulp. What the fuck, my English is already weak, man, can you not interrupt me! -You and I are equal, that's what I am... -We're not fucking equal! -You got a problem with that, bitch? -No, no. Fucking curry faggot. You fucking bastard! Get down! Open your fucking mouth. You want this? Open your fucking mouth. Open your-- Fuck! You want some of this? Huh? Open wide. Fuck! Get him off me! Get off me! Get off me! Get the fuck off me! Kill this fucker first! Come on! Try as hard as the world might to knock me down, but the victory will be mine. What's wrong with you? You've lost your mind! Don't you dare! Cut! Cut! Cut! Sir, what's wrong with you? Where are you going? I can clean out the track and light, but the beacon, how will I clean that out? Sorry, sorry. Actors, very good. One more take... One sec, Gary. Ma'am, he's here. He would like to see you. We'll have to go. Mr. Wadhwa! Oh, my God! What a pleasant surprise! What brings you to South Africa? Come here. Please pull up a chair or something. Guys, can we have some privacy, please? Deepak, come on. Let's go. Let's clear the room, please. You would've guessed that I'm... here to talk about my film. Oh, right. Your magnum opus, your Mughal-e-Azam. How is it going? Is the shooting over? Look, Zarina, you are well aware that thousands of people have worked on this film. I mean, if this film doesn't release my studio will shut down. Thousands will lose their jobs. Is that what you want, huh? Look, please, don't do this. Okay. I will save your film. And I'll lighten your two hundred crore worth of burden, too. What do you mean? I mean, you'll transfer all the rights of your film to me, at no cost. And my production house will release this film. And I'll give you 20 percent profit. Are you mad? This is my film. You have ten seconds to say yes. After every ten seconds, I'll reduce your profit by five percent. -Fifteen! -Accepted! Very good. Mr. Bhatia! Please bring in some pastries for Mr. Wadhwa. It's time for celebration, isn't it? Okay, see you. Here you go, asshole. Thank you, boss, otherwise he would've definitely put his thing in my mouth. Come on, drink up, you asshole, I'm not poisoning you. I'm offering it as a friend. Would you have taken it if I had offered it to you? Answer me. Whenever someone spoke of you in Mirzapur... I used to dream about meeting you, learning from you. To be like you. I've become like you now, haven't I? You were my hero. Hero. When I was little, I had a fast friend, Kapil. Not just a friend, he was more like a brother. We used to do everything together. In the classroom, at school, outside... One day, it was, what do you call it... parent-teacher meeting. Papa came to the school, Kapil was with me. So I introduced him. "Papa, Kapil Lakheriya." Papa just walked away. I didn't understand anything. When I got home that evening, Papa beat me black and blue, every single bone in my body was in pain. I couldn't understand the reason. I thought that bastard Kapil ratted me out, and hence the punishment. I hated his guts. I stopped talking to him. Rumor had it that Kapil had been harassing a Brahmin girl. The guys were outraged. They got together and were going to beat him to a pulp. I joined the party. We beat the fucker black and blue! We went at him so hard that we ripped the fucker's clothes off. A couple of days later, I found out that Kapil... Look... all this drama about caste and religion, it's... I didn't start it. I grew up in it. That's what I have been taught. And I'm just doing what I taught as a child. Now, whom should I apologize to? To Kapil? To God? I'm a Brahmin. Brahmins are considered an avatar of God, aren't they? That's what everyone says, isn't it? I don't deserve to be a Brahmin! When those fucking white guys were beating me, humiliating me like a dog... That's when I... stood in your shoes. Cheers. And that has been cracked through the covers and that's it! The Hurricanes are in the finals! First they tamed Ranchi in the eliminator, and now they have decisively beaten Chennai in the second qualifier. What a fairy tale run they've had this PPL! Hi. Yeah? You called me, Vayu. 'Cause you texted. That was days back. Anyway, I wanted to congratulate you on your performance. You were incredible. Well done. Look, Rohini, I know you are with the Hurricanes now. With Arvind. I just want you to know that it's fine, Ro. All the best for the finals. Yup. You, too. But you go tell Arvind one thing. Regardless of whosoever's help he takes, that trophy is mine. The Hurricanes are in the finals. Arvind Vashishth versus Vayu Raghavan. It'll be quite something. Bhaisaab, Ayesha? Four votes. But we were expecting six. How will we get the remaining two votes? By spending money. How much? A lot. It'll cost us a lot. It's not possible to make it off of one match. Betting too much on the spots will raise suspicion among bookies. There is only one way to make that kind of money in the finals, we have to bet on the result. We did bet on the results last time around, and we know how that turned out. No more gambling. We only bet on fixed events. Fair enough. We can't bet on the results, but... we can fix Vayu getting out. You will fix Vayu? There are other ways to get Vayu out. Ravi, Nachi and TJ, any one of them will get Vayu run out on our signal. And what if Vayu gets them run out? All three of them? Improbable. Besides, umpires are in our pocket, too. Are you sure about this, Zarina? Because my whole future depends... My future is at stake, too, Bhaisaab. But we are out of options now. As of now, you're losing the election. If this plan is successful, you'll get what you want. And... And? I should get what I want. What do you want? Hundred percent shares of the Mumbai Mavericks. I will be sole owner of the team. Deal? You've lost your mind. Is that a yes? And what if he wins it, huh? I mean, look at his form. He's never gonna stop hitting those fifties and hundreds, is he? And you were never gonna make me captain, were you? That's not true, TJ. We both know you are the better player. And the best person to lead the Mavericks for many seasons to come. But what if he wins the finals for the Mavericks? How the fuck are you gonna make me captain then? That's why I called you here. Run him out like you did the other guy in the Bangalore game. And then, no matter what, I will ensure that the team management and even the media support your captaincy. I promise. So, what about Vayu? We have to go with the law of averages, sir. Nothing else will work. Well, Ringo got him out once. And now we also have Kamran, who may surprise him. So I think, we have a damn good chance. And is that our best chance? Vayu's only been susceptible to quick short balls. But once he's set, then... Then he'll just devour our spinners. Especially off-spinners, which means Devender also is a risky option. Is he even back from jail? Yes, he is. Rohini! Vayu... I mean... Look, I understand if you don't wanna be part of this discussion... No, no, Arvind sir. I've said this before, I want Vayu to win. But in life. And for that, his ego must lose once. Okay. Tisha, what were you saying? What the hell is this? What happened? Save your acting for the screen, Zarina. These things are always in the news. Don't take it so seriously. Why did you do it? Come on. This news had to come out eventually. Already there are so many rumors on the social media... Not like this, Zarina. This is your doing. And ever since I opposed your plan to remove Vayu from captaincy, I've become like this thorn in your pedicured foot, right? You don't like anyone who doesn't agree with you. Please, Mantra, don't flatter yourself. You're not that important. You're just a protected, privileged little... girl, whose father has handed her a toy to play with. And, to my bad luck, that toy is the Mumbai Mavericks. Because now I'm the one who has to put up with your tantrums. Tantrums? Me? Yet you're the one who can't talk things through like an adult, and goes and blabs outside so it all ends up on social media? You're really clueless, aren't you? Do you have any idea what I have to do to run this team? And what your papa has to do to collect funds to run the ICB, regardless of whether those methods are right or... What are you talking about? Nothing. I've said too... You know what? I really don't have time for this. What do you mean about my father? Nothing. Go and live in your fantasy land with your boyfriend. Just don't forget to wave at the camera every now and then. I've got real work to do. Today, I had the chef make you a traditional South African Bobotie. I think you'll like it. Amazing aroma! Here's to your first successful PPL. Are you tense about the finals? You've had a great tournament so far. How did you like it so far? I hope you'll continue next year... Dad... are you in any big problem? No. Who said this to you? If you and Zarina want me to quit the Mavericks, then please just say so. Because even I want what's best for the team. If Zarina has said something to you, it's probably because she is under a lot of pressure. I'm sure she doesn't mean it. But, I'll talk to her anyway. Look, Dad, I'm not interested in playing mind games with Zarina. But I do need to know what's the connection between the Mavericks and your election that you are forced to indulge in wrongdoing? Look, darling, Zarina has had to take some tough decisions. For the team, for the ICB. Right now, everything might seem new and confusing to you, but you'll understand things with time. I promise, I'm not doing anything wrong. You have nothing to worry about. Come. I'll never let you down. Now can we eat, please? Arvind. You've been looking for Vikrant. Come with me. Your eyes say that you wanna kill me. As you can see, someone already tried. Why am I here? What needs to be done in every match, and how it needs to be done, I'll dictate that. So this is what I want you to do. Score a quick twenty-five. Go for everything. And then get out in the last over of the Powerplay. And whatever you do, your teammates, Vayu, Moses, and especially Rohini, shouldn't have the slightest doubt. So, now your first job will be in the next match against... Before you say anything, it's not my doing. Like you, I don't have anything to do with the Mavericks, anymore. The man behind this is the one I used to work for. And for whom Pritish works even today. The mastermind behind this cancer of match fixing. Yashwardhan Patil. Bhaisaab. I don't trust this video. Or a single word coming out of your mouth. I have nothing to gain by lying to you, Arvind. Who do you think is trying to kill me? Sudha, show him. The profits and losses of Bhaisaab's operations, after every PPL match. A shell company. His daughter's name features in it. And why are you telling me this? Because, Arvind Vashishth, you are the only principled man in the world of cricket. If you say there's match fixing going on in the PPL, everyone will believe it. I know... You don't believe me. Here. Call Rathore. Give me up. But before you do... listen to this. Hello, Niranjan, Joshi here, AJ. Yes, AJ? Stay under twenty tomorrow. But the closer you are to twenty, the higher the profits will be. Payment? Hey, Niranjan, why are you taking tension? The whole arrangement would be the same as always. Okay? AJ. A bookie we used. And the other voice is... you know, Suri. He made one mistake. And Bhaisaab used that to pressurize him to do his bidding. And when his conscience wouldn't allow it anymore, he decided to expose Bhaisaab to protect the game that he so loved. And that's when he was pushed over the ledge. Bhaisaab was responsible for the death of your friend, Niranjan Suri. I know what I want. Justice. What do you want, Arvind Vashishth? What do you want? Somehow I thought if I could get Dhawan, I can fix everything. I'd avenge Coach Suri's death. I'd rid cricket of this cancer. I was so stupid. I've been playing top-level cricket for the last fifteen years. This will be my twenty-fifth final. But today, for the first time, I have no interest in playing this match. Today, I can't even recognize the game that gave me everything. To which I owe it all. I don't recognize it. I don't understand it. This thing that Dhawan gave me, what do I do with it? Should I forget that Dhawan was the one who killed Coach Suri? Or should I ignore the fact that the president of the Indian Cricket Board himself fixes the matches? Vayu! Vayu! Vayu... Vayu, I'm ready. I want to play the final match please. I know you don't have faith in me, but just give me one chance! I swear, I'll set the pitch on fire with my bowling! Vayu, please hear me out... Please, just once... Vayu! Where is your kitbag? Welcome to this year's final of the PPL between the Haryana Hurricanes and the Mumbai Mavericks. Durban's atmosphere is absolutely electric with equal support for both teams. Guys, it's the usual eleven. There are a couple of changes that I'll come back and talk about. But first, gotta rush for the toss. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the toss. I have Vayu Raghavan and Arvind Vashishth. Arvind will toss the coin. -Heads. Tails. -Yeah. Tails. Heads it is. Arvind? We'll bat. Looks like a very good wicket. Any changes in your team? No. In fact, we're gonna go with the same team. The youngsters have worked really hard and they are eagerly waiting to give it their all. Fair enough. Are you happy chasing? Absolutely. I mean, we've always fancied our chances chasing. So, tonight should be no different. I think the key is to keep them down to a reasonable total. Any changes? A few. Ravi misses out, Nachi and Vishal aren't playing and Tyler. Tyler Jackson isn't playing? Why? What has happened to him? It's just part of our strategy. Interesting. Thanks, guys. Good luck on the field. Thank you so much. Well, that's a bit of a shocker. Tyler Jackson has been dropped from the finals. As are three other key players for the Mavericks. Boys, come on, let's go, let's go! Come on! Hey, Ringo! Have you been working on the butterfly ball? Why do you care? Give it a shot against Vayu. Why're you telling me this? Because that motherfucker just dropped me. Vayu knows what's going on. How? I don't know. But he dropped all our players. Now we can't get him runout or fix a spot. Then we're left with only one option. Yes. We bet on the result. Where the hell is Pritish?
