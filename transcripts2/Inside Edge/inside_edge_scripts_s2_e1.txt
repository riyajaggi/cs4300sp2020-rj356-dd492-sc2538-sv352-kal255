 Move! Move! Recheck the copy of those graphics. The next time someone uses Wikipedia, I'll bury them alive. No fuck ups, guys. If you make a mistake, just don't bother coming in tomorrow. This interview is one of the biggest we have ever done. There is no margin for error. Is that clear? Yes. Get on with it. He's not answering.

 Nothing more than a fucking assistant, but just look at his ego. Shikha. Mr. Kale. What is happening? My assistant has called you 15 times, but you... I see, I see. The thing is, I don't answer calls from unknown numbers. So... It's a security issue... I hope you're on your way. Sorry, but we're running late. Look, we need at least an hour with you. It's not possible for us to come there, Shikha. That's out of the question. Today we have few other engagements, too.

 Actually, Shikha, I was thinking that it might be better to reschedule it for another day. Sir, we have been promoting this interview for a month now. Now if you... The thing is, Shikha, I cannot guarantee anything. Hello and welcome to The People's Hour. I'm Girish Mukherjee. I am Girish Mukherjee. Today, we have with us one of the most hermetic... That's too much. Yeah. Enigmatic? Mysterious? Reclusive? Reclusive leaders of the Lok Shakti Party. Today, we have with us... Lok Shakti Party. Reclusive leaders of the Lok Shakti Party. I'm Girish Mukherjee. Today, we have with us one of the most... Sir? What's wrong? He just hung up? Yes. Tell you what, Shikha. He assured us his time, and I am gonna make him honor his commitment. -But, Girish, you... -Phone. Mr. Patil? Good evening, Mr. Shinde. How are you? How did you like Australia? It was good. I could learn a lot. Did Mrs. Lalita join you there? Yes. I spent lakhs to send you to Australia... To study the pitch. So, tell me, what's the difference between this wicket and Perth's wicket? Why is there so little grass on this pitch? That is because it did not rain, so... Sir, I have been tending the pitches for the last 20 years. Mumbai's pitch has always been like this. First day, swing. And third day, spinners. So, the rain is to be blamed? Kale. Shift tomorrow's match. Tell them the pitch is not ready. Fix it. Swing. Seam. Pace. I'll be back to check on it. Started alone? Today, you will have tea with someone else. Come on, hurry up. Quick. Mr. Girish, your persistence is commendable. You came all the way to interview me. This is my service to the people of this country, sir. That's all. Kale. Always in mid-shot. Feet shouldn't be on-camera. Pull the mic up. Higher. Pan to the right. Now, stop. I have personally checked all the questions. Just answer them calmly. Straight and softly. Roll sound. Roll camera. Okay, Girish? Action. Welcome to The People's Hour. I am Girish Mukherjee. And today, we have with us the leader of the Lok Shakti Party and the most important man in Indian cricket. He has changed the face of the game in the last few years. He is none other than the President of the Indian Cricket Board, Mr. Yashwardhan Patil. So let's start with last year's extremely controversial season of the PPL. For the first time in seven years, it felt like not everything in the league is a 100% okay. We had no statement from you. You were simply missing. Just because I wasn't seen, doesn't mean I was missing. You know that I don't enjoy this hullabaloo, camera, publicity etcetera. But my absence was misconstrued as my negligence. Maybe that's why it brought out the ill will of some people. And that's why the ICB, and I personally, have decided to play a more hands-on role from this year. So, are you promising that there will be no more controversies in this year's PPL? Generating controversy is your job. My job is to further Indian cricket. What about the death of Mr. Niranjan Suri? Did some journalist murder him to generate controversy? He's going off-script. I assume you read the police report. It said it was a suicide, personal reasons, etcetera, etcetera. Well, that's all there is to it. Oh, really? Mr. Girish, I know that if the truth isn't sensational, riddled with controversy, if it doesn't boost your program's ratings, you don't believe that truth. Well, what's the truth about the ownership of the Mumbai Mavericks? What do you mean? Sir, isn't it true that your daughter Mantra is the majority stakeholder of the Mumbai Mavericks? Yes, she is. And you don't feel that that's a problem? The problem is your sexism. Whenever an independent woman achieves something by herself, you can't help but question her achievements. Mantra raised the funds all by herself and bought the team at its market value. It was purely a business deal. Sir, what about conflict of interest? And the nepotism? If you have any evidence of wrongdoing, please tell me. Otherwise, you're wasting my time. Where has the ex-owner Vikrant Dhawan disappeared, and what's your relationship with him? Shikha, what is he blabbering? I'll put a stop to all this right now. Never mind, next question. Bangalore team will be up for auction soon. Is that team reserved for your friends and family, too? The highest bidder will get the team, provided they meet our technical criteria. The process will be transparent. Sir, everyone knows how transparent it's going to be. What impresses me is the brazenness of it all. Don't you think that the ICB should come under the Right to Information Act? Don't you think that there should be an independent committee to audit the whole process? So, that we can have some checks and balances? You are openly selling cricket. Your profit is running into millions and billions. And there is zero accountability. Indian Cricket is not your personal property, Mr. Patil. It belongs to all of us. And we have to save our beloved game from this nexus of criminals, politicians, film stars and businessmen. And as the head of the ICB, the buck stops at you, Mr. Patil. I asked you a question, sir. Mr. Girish Mukherjee, people don't need celebrity journalists like you to ask their questions. I've been working with Indian cricket for the last 35 years. Since 1983, the World Cup year. Back then, we didn't even have the money to reward the players. And today, we all can see how much Indian cricket has progressed. Do you have a problem if the Indian Cricket Board is the richest and the most powerful in the world? Sir, I don't know about your other cricketing talents, but you sure can duck bouncers very well. Thank you, Mr. Patil. Thank you very much. Okay, cut. It was your best interview yet. Sir? We have a tradition at The People's Hour. We take a selfie with all our guests. May I? -Sure. -Sir, please, if you may. Sir, a little more... Okay. Thank you. Sir, if I may... It's been bothering me a little. Whom were you texting during the show? Your producer will tell you about it. Girish? Girish? I just got a call... I'm Girish Mukherjee. Nobody sacks me. I know. It doesn't make sense. Mr. Patil! You will pay for this, Bhaisaab! Please tell me why am I here again? It's your lucky day. You get to be my arm candy. And anyway, if you want to be a captain, you better get used to these events. So, just suck it up and smile. Thank you. -I'll be at the bar. -Yeah. -Hi. -Hi, you look lovely. -How have you been? -Hi. Good. Thanks for coming. I'm sure you like the arrangements over here. Yeah. Hello, Imtiaz. I've heard you haven't signed the contract yet. And here you are, throwing a launch party. This is not just a film launch celebration. Then? This party is to celebrate me. Such humility! I might just start crying. Please don't hold back. Who does she think she is? No, no, I'm gonna tell her that I don't want to be the captain. Don't be an idiot, Vayu. This is your chance. If you want to lead the Indian team someday, then you have to... Now you don't start with this, man. Listen, I am tired of having this conversation with you over and over again. Fuck, I hate these parties, Ro. Co-owner of the Mavericks, undisputed queen of Bollywood, more endorsements than ever before. Where's my crown? Your Highness, you might wear the crown, but the real power will always be with some dickhead. Wadhwa? He's under my thumb. Enjoy your drink, Imtiaz. That's enough. -Orange juice. -Orange juice. Hey, you're Vayu, right? -So, I just wanted to... -Please. No selfies. You're nice. Excuse me? That was rude. Hey, what do you all think of yourselves? Are we your servants? Always hounding us for selfies. In bathrooms, in restaurants. You stick your cameras in our faces, and if we refuse, we are the rude ones. -Hey, look, you've actually got it all... -Yeah. Please, just leave me alone. Fuck off. You know, Zarina, this year our studio is set to release three films. But this is gonna be our tentpole film. Mind you, this is gonna be your career-shaping film. I mean, it's not that your other films were, you know... I get it, Mr. Wadhwa. Are you enjoying the party? -Yeah. Class party, yeah. -Isn't it? Okay, come to the office tomorrow, the contract will be ready. As we discussed? -Of course, of course. Cheers, cheers. -Cheers. Please try this. -Sure. -Bhaisaab is calling. Bhaisaab? Can't believe you came. Well, how can I decline an invitation from my business partner? Please. I'd ask you to come down and join the party, but I know you're not much of a people's person. But I hope your daughter is not like you. She has to get used to the limelight. You can tell her yourself. Teach her the ropes. 85% or not, you are in charge of the team. Thank you, Bhaisaab. But I'm very happy, to be honest. That she's joining the Mavericks. I really believe she has a lot of potential. And what about your potential, Zarina? You should know you're special, too. Thank you for inviting me. I wish you all the success. Thank you. Find me Mantra, will you? Sure. Hello, Mr. Home Minister. Patil, you've been ignoring my phone calls these days. I think I'll have to send a notice from the Enforcement Directorate. Forgive me, Mr. Hussain. I was rather busy planning the PPL. Well, then, please take my work also into account in your planning. What's the status of my team? Once all the bids are in, I'll tell you the correct bidding amount. Then we can finalize the sale. But what's the need for all these shenanigans? Give me the team and get it over with. Look, sir, this is a rather important time for the PPL. More transparent the bidding process for the new team is, the better it would be. For you and for me. Be quick about it, Patil. My son has already decided the players for the team. Of course, Mr. Hussain. -Zarina. -Hi. Finally. Hi. Vayu, meet Mantra. Mantra Patil. New co-owner of the Mavericks. Fuck me. Vayu, behave yourself... No, I mean... Nice to meet you. New captain of... Ignore him. Listen, I know you've already refused, but I really want you there at the auction. And I will not take no for an answer. Let's show the world that two women can run a world-class cricket team together. Besides, you're the only one here with an MBA from London Business School. So... One sec. I'll just be... Please keep the champagne flowing. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Listen, look, I didn't mean to be... You get very nervous in high-pressure situations. You know, it's not a good sign for a batsman. Look, I don't know what I was thinking. Actually, it was the alcohol. But you were having orange juice. Yes, exactly, I don't make such mistakes after two drinks. Yeah... -Yeah... -Zarina. -But I think the beard looks... -Zarina? -Excuse me? -Sure. The press is asking more about Arvind than Vayu. They want to know if you'll be bidding for him this year again. -And who will be the captain this year... -Pritesh, I have no clue. I have no idea where on Earth Arvind Vashishth is. Arvind. -Hey, Ziggy. -Hey, Arvind. Did you catch anything? You wanna see? There. Every single time. I told you. I want a big fish, big tuna, big mackerel. I'm getting better at this, Ziggy. Useless fisherman. What do I make with this, huh? I'm sure you'll make something delicious. By the way, a sexy Bollywood actress come to see you. -Where? -There. Promise big, deliver small. I learn from the best. You can always add some spices to a small fish and make some Amritsari tikka. How about that, Arvind? Because to catch a big fish, one needs to put in big effort. It takes a lot of work. It took me three flights and 25 hours to get here. My whole body hurts. I can't feel my butt. And you don't answer my phone calls these days, so I don't see those blue ticks on WhatsApp anymore either. You haven't blocked Handa, have you? Boss, please say something. Mr. Handa, you came to my house ten times. -Fourteen times. -Okay, 14. You made so many phone calls, sent so many texts. But my answer didn't change. Then why will it change on visiting me in Jamaica? Because, sir, I have a one-of-a-kind offer for you. Arvind, I'm a simple man. The minute we win, all our sorrows are gone. But you are not like that. You don't care about money. I mean, a player who gave everything to cricket, and cricket took everything from him, why would he ever return to the game? And why will he captain my good-for-nothing team? To win the PPL? So I did some digging, and got this offer for you. It's a Godfather-esque offer, boss. You can't refuse it. And what is your offer? Arvind, if you agree to captain the Haryana Hurricane team, I'll get them to reopen the file for the Niranjan Suri murder case. And I'll help you to bring his killer to justice. I know who killed him. I'm not talking about finding out who killed him. I'm talking about bringing him to justice. What do you say? So, do you accept the offer? As we've increasingly noticed, that in T20 cricket, statistical analysis has become much more granular. Earlier, when we bid at the auctions, we would look for specialists. A bowling all-rounder, an opening batsman, a batsman who could keep. But now, it's much more specific. We look for a spinner who can take wickets between overs eight to 16, or a batsman, who has a strike rate of 150, but would take more than 40% of his runs in ones and twos. So, the specialists are a lot more specialized in their roles. Naturally, we can only have 11 players on the field. According to the roles, the conditions, as well as the... Opposition. Any questions? See? I told you. He's too good. I've been following him since he was 12, since his Harris Shield days. I can't believe this is his first Under-19 tournament. He'll definitely play for India someday. Planning to buy him for the Mavericks at the auction? I'm sorry, I shouldn't be asking you these questions. Yes, he is on my potentials list. Rohini, I'm returning to the PPL. With the Hurricanes? I'm not surprised you guessed that. Well, no other team needs a captain as badly as them, so... Then you must also know why I'm here to meet you. Because you were missing me a lot. Arvind sir, I would love to work with you... But I can't. -I can't leave Vayu... -I know, I know. But I had to give it a try. Look at this boy. This is his triple century. I have to convince Vayu to buy him, huh? Speak of the devil. Arvind, what brings you here? Yeah, Vayu. Surprised to see me? Guess what? I'm coming back to the PPL. Well, as long as you're not coming back to play for the Mavericks... Nice. Don't worry. I saw your photographs with Zarina, hand-in-hand. And the next thing you know, you're the captain of the Mavericks, huh? Arvind sir came to see me. That's right. I came to ask Rohini if she'd work with me. Well, that's not gonna happen ever. I thought you were done with all this. What changed? Come back from retirement, Mr. Arvind Afridi? Vayu, please. I can see I'm getting under your skin. You're still the same, zero control on emotions. Is this how you are gonna captain the Mavericks? Vayu, take my advice... I don't need captaincy advice from you. Save your lectures for your own team. You won't learn like this. When I defeat you in PPL, then you'll learn. And guess what? Your class restarts today. And I'll rollback your PPL comeback. That's the spirit. I'll see you on the field. Who's next? Mr. Peter Lox. He's England's ex... I know who he is. I'm sorry. Do you mind? No. That's okay. So, Mr. Lox was very keen on becoming the Mavericks' coach. But as soon as I told him that this time Vayu will be the captain, and not Arvind, he got a little cold feet. Is Vayu radioactive? Stop mentioning him to the coaches. So, what should I tell them? That after the auctions next month... We'll decide the captain. When is the first round of interviews? The modern coaching job necessitates the integration and optimization of a number of methodologies... I didn't bring any PowerPoints. It's all New Age nonsense. Let me be your guide through the darkness toward the light. Coaching happens on the field. Face to face. I will face this way and give my presentation. One sec. One sec. Fuck this shit, man. Bullshit. Rohini's recommendation is up next. Finally. Who is he? Ex-India wicketkeeper. Has been under the radar for a while, but started off as a coach for the Goa T20 team for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. And that is? The interstate T20 tournament. Goa were always underdogs. Has never made it to the knockouts, even, all these years. And then he comes in, and coaches them all the way to the semis. Zarina, maybe you wanna have a look. Of course. Hi. Welcome. Moses Alexander. We like you already. I see you've also worked with Mr. Niranjan Suri. I knew him very well. Mr. Handa, it's 8:00 in the morning. What are we doing here? Arvind, I didn't bring you out here for fishing. I can't stand this stench. No, Arvind, you can't do this. Please, please. Mr. Handa, I'm not interested in talking to this man. You don't know what he did with me last year. Arvind, Mr. Rathore is part of this system. He has to do the system's bidding. And I manipulated the very same system to set up this meeting. If you want to bring Mr. Suri's killer to justice, then who's a better man for the job than the investigating officer of that case? On whose orders did you close this case? -Hey, let bygones be bygones... -No, no, no, no, Mr. Handa. Arvind, cricket is a multi-billion dollar business. Everyone has a finger in the pie. Now, the question is, whose fingers interest you? Everyone knows who killed him. Arvind, there is a big difference between knowing something and holding evidence. Do you have any proof? Proof? Mr. Rathore, I think you are forgetting that I'm a cricketer and you are the cop. Gathering the proof is your job, not mine. -Mr. Handa, you... -Arvind... Arvind, listen, Arvind. No one knows if Dhawan is alive or dead. But if he is alive, we will find him, we will catch him and bring him to justice. Since when did you become a cricket fan? Is it a must to be a cricket fan to become a PPL team owner? If that's the case, half the team owners would've been disqualified. And, I think, you also took the leap from politics to cricket. Why do you want to buy a team? And that too the Bangalore team. It's quite far from Delhi. I have my reasons. And where will you get the money from? I have my sources. Last year, I gave you a really important tip. There are some lines that you cannot and should not cross. Indian Cricket Board's presidential elections are going to be held this year. The wind is blowing in your favor, but votes might turn. MP, Orissa, Jharkhand. Three states that were most likely to vote for Basu, will vote for you. I am the ICB President. I don't need your help to win the elections. Of course not. But Basu does. And what should we do about those 15 Pakistani fishermen, sir, who were caught entering our territorial waters? Let those bastards rot in jail! What a pleasant surprise, Ayesha. What a pleasant surprise. Sorry... I wanted to talk to you. Because of our plan last year, you got Arvind. And I got this team. When we have the same business interests, you know, it can be a bit of a problem. So, I think we shouldn't meet anymore. Parting gift from me. It's your favorite. And the first name of the day. Mr. Arvind Vashishth. Good morning, good morning, Arvind. Mr. Handa. Good morning. How are you? Am I late? No, actually, I start early. So, I came in a couple of hours early. Okay, so we're starting from scratch. All other teams have a base on which they can build their team. But we... -Don't... -Arvind, would you like to have some tea or coffee? -No, I want a frontline batsman. -Right. And, Mr. Handa, I need stats of some players, too. Yeah, of course. We have an analyst, Lambodar. Hey, where are you? Come here. Yes, sir. -Hi, I'm Arvind. -I know, sir. Okay, what's your opinion about TJ? How will he fare against the spinners on subcontinent wickets? Come on. Why is there only one cup? Didn't you see how many people are here? Go and get two more cups. So, I was asking about TJ's stats? He is good. Bats well. What is... "He is good. Bats well." Is this how you give an opinion? -Sir, why are you asking me? -Then whom should I ask? Sir, but that's... I... Sir... He is not who you think he is... You... Sir, one minute. I'm the person, sir, who you thought he is... What the fuck is going on? He's been here since 6:00. Sir, I'm Lambodar, sir. -And he's Arvind, sir. -I'm Arvind. His name is also Arvind, sir. I'll go get the tea. So you are Lambodar? So, our priority is a frontline batsman. I think we should go for TJ. Tyler Jackson. I agree. He's fantastic. Best batsman on current form. 1245 runs last year in T20. Strike rate, 170. Dependable opener. A good replacement for Litner. But? Remember, in life as in cricket, all good things come with a catch. Tell me, what's the problem? He's young and ambitious. Has told the media he'd like to captain a PPL team, so... Well, if he deserves it, he should be in contention. I mean, there should be competition at every level. Just raises the bar for everyone. Cash, cash. How much will he cost us? Sir, 13 to 15 crores, sir. Arvind, do you agree with the fact that TJ's cost is equal to that of two players? Look at his stats. And he's good-looking, popular. It'll help with endorsements. Do you want to bring in TJ to sell shampoo and biscuits? Well, I believe he's worth the money based on his batting alone. His gorgeousness is just a bonus. Look, as far as you are concerned, we'll be spending around two-three... Three-four crores on you. And after that, we will go all out for TJ. So, who's gonna offer the first bid for Arvind? A legend in the world of cricket. Do I have an opening bid? We have an opening bid from Haryana Hurricanes at two crores. Do I hear 2.5? Anyone? 2.5? 2.5? Going once, twice... -Ten crores. -Ten crores? The Mavericks have bid 10 crores. My God, ladies and gentlemen, these auctions have started with a bang. Motherfucker!
