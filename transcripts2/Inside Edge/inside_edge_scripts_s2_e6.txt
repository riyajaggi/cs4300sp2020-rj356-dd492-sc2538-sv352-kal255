 Where have you brought me, man? God knows what kind of hellhole this is. Come on. What needs to be done in each match, and how it needs to be done, I'll dictate that. You will not talk to each other at all. And whatever you do, your teammates, Vayu, Moses, and especially Rohini, they shouldn't doubt you in the slightest. So, your first job starts with your next match with the Legends.

 Not conflict of interest, treason. This is treason. Forget playing matches with Pakistan, we can't even engage in a conversation with them. And he goes there and builds a rival league itself. "What do I complain about, "to whom do I complain, "when my lover has with enemy lain." I am not sure what's worse, your politics or your poetry. Worry about yourself, not me, Patil.

 Let me make one thing clear. None of this is connected to me. I haven't given a penny to Pakistan, and I can prove it to the Board, as well as the public. And we'll just believe you, isn't it? This time there will be a thorough investigation, Patil. Let the world see your true colors. Quit campaigning, Mr. Basu. ICB elections are a while away. I just pray to the Almighty, Patil, that Indian cricket shouldn't come to an end before your term is over. The meeting is over, gentlemen. Thank you. So what's your threat this time around, Patil? Mr. Basu, general elections are coming up. Focus on that. If you win, I'll ensure that you get a ministry. So, you want me to step back from the ICB elections? Go talk to the people in your camp in the state associations. Stick a thermometer in their mouth to get a sense of the anger boiling within. Kale, your boss has no idea what's gonna hit him. More than half of the state associations are upset with us. Entire nation is outraged. Under these circumstances, no one is going to vote for us during election time. And then there's that asshole Home Minister. He is going to initiate a CBI inquiry. Though Bhaisaab hasn't violated a single law. The Pakistan investment is totally legal. It doesn't matter. There will be an inquiry and this news will keep grabbing headlines. Bhaisaab is right. We will find a solution for the elections later. Right now, we need to figure out how to kill this story? Whoever has leaked this story, has worked very hard for it. And we will have to work twice as hard to bury this story. Step one, spin. Come on, Mr. Parekh, punch us in. Counter every accusation, defend every attack, discredit every piece of evidence. It's done. I won't take much of your time. I'm not part of any of the companies that invested in Pakistan. All these documents are fake and it's a conspiracy to frame me. Here are the original ROC documents. And I'll take strict legal action against the newspaper that published this fake news story. That will be all. Step two, counter. Neutralize every person that tries to attack us. It won't be easy to put a lid on Patankar. Patankar and I go way back. Hello, Brother. I couldn't come and enquire about your health, apologies for that. Anyway, your son has crossed his limits. The thing is, when the son strays out of line, his father must rein him in. We go back 37 years, Brother. How many skeletons we might have to pull out of the closet? Do you want to spend the last few years of your life in jail or... Call Bhalerao. Hey, stop, stop, stop! What? What's wrong? We are out of booze, man. Ah, fuck! So... Let's get it from there. Let's go. Come on. -Come on. -Okay. Come, Zuzu. Go. Hey! Wait up! Come on! Come on! -Hey, run! -Fucker, run faster! Move! Move! Move! -Open it! Open! -Hey! Open! Open! Open! Hurry up! -Shit! -Hurry up! -Hurry up! -Stop! -Step on it! Step on it! -Step on it! Hey... Motherfucking thieves! Shit! Fuck! You shouldn't have come. Not just you... -Easy. -...no one should see me in this state. Take it easy. Wipe yourself. Easy now. Rohini? I read your report. "How to design a PPL team." Well done. Really? You know, I have been working on it for a long time. I'm sure it'll work. Did you show it to Vayu? People think we are cricketers, we have money. What more can they want? Fuckers. No one stands by us when the times are bad. Whether it's the public, or the selectors. Whether it's... I lost two matches after she left. Not a call, text, nothing. I mean, am I her brother or not? Bloody, am I important to her or not? She just up and left for India. Hey, Prashant. Did you have one too many? Where will I go now, Vayu? Tell me? How will I face my family? This was my only chance, and I blew it. What rubbish, man. You will play in the next match. That's my word. You will play. That's it. I can't take any more insult. I'll return these eight crores... No, I'll return these eight and a half crores. The media, Moses sir, they asked you to drop me. So drop me. Do it. Set me free. Don't mess with my fucking brains, man. Fuck! Fuck. Pass the beer. Hey, pass the beer. Fuck. Set me free. I don't want to play with them. Coming, coming. Coming, coming, coming, man! I don't want any fucking... Team room. Five minutes. Come. Fantastic Four. Here's your captain. See this? The store's CCTV pictures are all over the Internet. We have become a laughing-stock. I mean, what the fuck were you guys thinking? What's he doing here? You don't get to ask questions today, Mr. Raghavan. TJ, who was the one who started the drinking last night? I need to know. Now. Well, Ravi and Vayu came and knocked on my door. Invited me out. Looks like I missed a hell of a party, boys. Are we a bunch of school kids, that you'll get him to complain and then punish us? We made a mistake, it happens. Out. Everyone. Not you. Do you have any idea how much we had to beg and grovel for that guy to not file a police complaint? No. No, you don't. Because you're fucking stupid, Vayu. And you're stubborn. You're the reason why this team is near the bottom of the table. You are the reason why we can't win matches. This boy, Prashant, the one you've been backing all along, even he has had the sense to drop himself so that we can win. If you had even an iota of self-respect, Vayu, an iota, you would have resigned from this team's captaincy long back. Your form is absolutely fucking shit. The bowlers are banging them in short, and you're looking clueless out there in the middle. If we lose today, consider your captaincy over. And if it were left to me, I would throw you out of the team as well. You're a disruptive influence and I won't let anyone come between me and my team. Do you have anything to do with what's going on with Bhaisaab? Do you fear him? Dhawan, general elections are around the corner. There are lot of things I need to manage and I don't want any problems in PPL. -Sure. -I mean it, Dhawan. Ayesha, I'm not gonna sabotage your operations by needling Bhaisaab. I hope not. Patankar has reined-in his horses. And protests are subsiding in other cities too. But the media hasn't let go of this topic yet. They won't. Till they get another topic to harp on. TV news channels can only create a ruckus about only one topic at a time. We must create another issue to divert them. How? Which issue? Something as big and as popular as cricket. A little controversial. Something sensational, so the TV news channels can't help but debate only about that. If you have given it so much thought, then you must have come up with an idea, too. I do have an idea which will solve both of our problems. Hey! What's going on? What's going on? This picture goes against the Indian culture and its values! No, no. You want to make money at the expense of our sentiments, you bastard! -Burn his set down. -Hey! Burn it down! Tired of losing yet? Are you okay? Yeah. What happened, Vayu? What's bothering you? Is it your form? You can talk to me. I don't know, Mantra. It feels like the whole world is against me. Rohini left me. Moses wants me to resign from captaincy. And Zarina is fucking helping him. Bitch. And Prashant goes and drops himself from the team after everything I did for him. And, yeah, my form is fucking screwed in this. Fuck. Fuck... Fuck. What? You know, Vayu, before I met you, I read about you in the news. Your attitude, your controversies... -Cheerleader-gate... -Look, that was all just fake news, man. Regardless, you're still judged by all these people. The media, your teammates, fans... Pressure must have been immense. You remember that final match? I watched it on TV. And like millions of others, I was just... blown away. How did you do that, Vayu? I don't know. Let me tell you. When you were at the pitch with your bat in hand, your focus was unshakeable. No media, no fans, nothing could distract you. It was just you. And the game that you love. I've seen that... look in your eyes. That hunger. You can do it again. You can feel that again. You just need to resolve it here. Surprised? I... Look, I know I'm the last person who should be doling out any kind of advice, considering I barely listen to anyone. And a couple of times that I should have, I... Anyways, fuck that. Look, I know I'm not a model captain. And I know that thanks to me, everyone from journalists to South African storekeepers are after us. Sometimes with a shotgun. But for better or worse, I am your captain now. Yeah. And I'm gonna do the only thing I know. Lead by example. The rest is up to you guys. Get out of my way. Oh, yeah, one more thing. Listen, guys, I just want to tell you something. We're not just any team. No. We're the fucking Mavericks! -Yeah! -Yes? -Yeah! -We're the best team in the PPL. Yes! Always have been. Out of my way now. Mavericks are the best! We've have screwed the rest! We've have screwed... The rest! Vayu! Vayu! Vayu! Arvind! Arvind! Arvind! Arvind! Here. Easy. Enough. We won't talk about cricket anymore. We won't talk about cricket. But can we at least... watch some cricket? Please. Hurricanes' start was awe-inspiring... ...but then they were left choking. Fact is, this is the lowest total made against Mavericks this season. This was all thanks to some great bowling by Mumbai in the death over. Absolutely. And I think, for the first time in this season, Mavericks' bowlers seemed disciplined and all fired up, especially Nagarjun, who was playing his first match. Yeah, he could be a part of the team because, finally, Mumbai dropped their weak link, Prashant Kanaujia. We are back after the Too Yum time-out. TJ and Ravi's partnership has earned 27 runs in 3 overs for the Mavericks. There's our signal. Ravi, this over. Banks to Ravi. -Howzat! -Howzat! He edged it and he's caught behind! A bad shot. And Mavericks take their first hit. So, these are the odds. And you see this column? This is where you key-in the betting amount. Why don't you go ahead and place the bets? I'll show you how it works. You want me to pull the trigger? Bhaisaab thought it'll be a good idea. Next batsman is Captain Vayu Raghavan. Vayu has been in a really bad form this season. One can't bet on him at all. Absolutely. It's essential that Vayu and TJ stay on the wicket for a few overs. Banks to Vayu. Right on Vayu's Achilles' heel. Bouncer. Vayu moved away from the line of the ball and let the ball pass. Another bouncer. Hurricanes have done their homework well today. Vayu, who likes to play on his front foot, he's being compelled to play on his back foot. In this season of PPL, Vayu's form hasn't been great. And the South African pitches haven't helped either. There's just too much pressure on TJ. The Mavericks have won every single time he's fired, and struggled when he hasn't. That's right. As long as he's there, there's still hope for Mumbai to win the game. Ringo comes in. TJ takes the aerial route and there's a fielder getting under it. Has it got the legs? No! It doesn't! TJ's gone, and so have Mumbai's hopes of winning the game. Commentator's curse, Carl. We jinxed it. Just when we were discussing, when the star batsman had to go the distance. Mumbai fans, fetch yourself a consolation drink. Haryana is firmly in the driver's seat now. Short. And a wild swing from Vayu, it doesn't connect. Back foot. He needs to play on his back foot. Vayu, you're next. Back foot! Hey, play on your back foot. It's a short ball. Play it on your back foot. Boom! Vayu swivels on his back foot and pulls it for a maximum! Something in that shot there, something in Vayu's demeanor. An intensity, a spark of flame we haven't seen before. Could this herald a turning point in the game? Short. Back foot. Pulls it. Boundary. Lost it over mid-on and another four! Vayu's first 50 in this PPL! Vayu taps the ball and steals a quick single. Clever shot from Vayu. With some quick thinking, he made good use of the bowler's pace. I've never seen this avatar of Vayu before. When will Nachi give the signal? Closer to the target. We still have to win. Make the playoffs. I know. Much bigger stakes there. Arvind hands the penultimate over to Vidyut. Wisely keeping Ringo away from Vayu. They're missing a spinner today. You know what's interesting, Carl? That most of Vayu's shots have come off the back foot. This slight adjustment has helped him accommodate to these local conditions. That's it. Vidyut runs in. Nachi taps the ball and calls, but will he make it? Direct hit and Nachi is gone! No dive there, sloppy cricket. Beginner's luck. Luck has no place in the game we play. You're starting to sound like someone I know. Sixteen needed off seven. That smashed hard and straight into short mid-wicket. Banks is down. Has he hurt his finger? No, it looks like the ball has hit him on the thigh. That was a mighty strike, all right. All right, let's go, let's go! Here, here. Come on, come on, let's go! Sixteen runs needed in six balls. Easy for an in-form Vayu. I hope Banks is 100% again. He has been, by far, Haryana's best bowler at the death. Give me the ball. Take your cap. What's going on? Arvind has changed his mind at the last minute... Ringo! ...and handed the ball to Ringo instead of Banks. A rather shocking decision. Ringo has proved very costly today. He doesn't look very eager to bowl either. Banks is looking a little disappointed. And rightly so. Looking at Ringo's form in this match, the last over should have gone to him. That's right, Chetan. Vayu has taken Ringo to the cleaners today. And he hits! Ball is up in the air... And an easy catch! Ringo is proving Arvind's decision right. Come on, Vayu. Now you have to win this for us. Sixteen runs needed from five balls. Ringo to Vayu. And a slog sweep from Vayu. The ball dashes through the gap between square leg and deep mid-wicket for a four. Arvind Vashishth looks quite worried because of Vayu's form. Twelve runs needed from four balls. And Vayu has cracked a super sixer! Now Vayu is at 99! Vayu giving Ringo's pistol celebration back to him. Three balls, six runs. With just one cracking hit, Vayu can lead his team to win this match. Marvelous shot. Marvelous century. And a marvelous victory. Vayu has taken Mavericks to victory single-handedly. And look at this. An answer to Ringo's pistol celebration, Vayu's shotgun celebration. Hurricanes must surely be feeling the lack of a world-class spinner. But today, Arvind's captaincy, and especially his decision to hand the last over to Ringo, will be questioned. In the end, we can conclude that today, Arvind's strategies fared zero, and Vayu emerged as the hero. Now that Vayu is in form, it's done. Just wait and watch, Baba, we'll definitely make it to the finals. Baba? Baba? Baba. Baba? Mr. Handa. What happened, Tisha? Confirmation. Venkat can't get back from Bombay. Fuck. Good that you have a backup plan, Tisha. And how about him? When will he get here? His flight will land in an hour. That's a nice car. Sandy! Prashant? Just a second, girls. Come. Come. Car. Look, look. Are you okay? Yes, okay. Okay, come sit? Long drive? Just carry on, girls. Today, I finally saw the Vayu Raghavan I've heard so much about. Thank you. Don't thank me. It was all you. Alone, out there, creating a storm. It was one of my best innings. You made it happen. I owe you. You can pay me right now. How will I? Arvind, please, can you quit being so stubborn? Okay, even if I agree with you, which frontline spinner can join us mid-season, and start performing right off the bat? Experienced spinners don't grow on trees. The answer to your question has just arrived. Prashant. You don't seem okay. See, I bowl this speed. I bowl this speed. Yeah. Yeah. See? When a frog lands himself a princess, he starts acting like a hero. No, no, you did the right thing by dropping yourself out of the team. Who can put up with so much embarrassment! Careful, Prashant, you haven't driven on these roads before. Step on it, my boy. What the fuck! Go faster. Please, Prashant, can you just pull over? Yes, motherfucker! Prashant! Faster! Prashant! Prashant, just pull over the car! Faster! Look in front, you asshole. What the fuck is wrong with you? You fucking stupid man! What the hell were you thinking? What the hell were you thinking? What's wrong with you, Prashant? Man, we still have a lot to do. Hi. Hi. He's gone, Vayu. He was watching you bat. He was very happy. Tanay, just... What do you want, Rohini? Want? -I thought you... -What did you think? That it will break my heart? I'll break down? -Fucker. -What are you saying, Vayu? What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? You left me for him. We lost two games because you weren't here. And that reserves' list? The one that you gave Arvind during the auction? You don't think that was unethical? You weren't going to... We weren't going to use them. Yeah. And, yeah, you voted against me during Prashant's selection, too. Against your own brother. You know he wasn't performing, Vayu. Rohini, I know everything. You don't give a fuck about me. Your priority is Arvind, Moses, and that bastard. -What? -Not me. He's dead, Vayu! So? What about the things he did? Have you forgotten? That was ages ago, Vayu. But I haven't forgotten. Rohini. Where is your high and mighty brother? You only did ten laps? Run for another ten laps. Sir... I'll never be late again. You said this last time, too. You want to play for India? Do you think it's your birth right? Do you think it's your birth right? Where have you come from? From where? Who are you? "I won't be late again," what does that even mean? Why are you late today? Just excuses! What are trying to tell me? He understands now! Please, Baba. Please! -What did he understand? -He understands now. -I'm gonna teach him a lesson today. -Please, Baba, don't do this! Please! -He understands now. -Let go! Rohini! Rohini. Rohini. Let me see. It was fine as long as it was me he was hitting and abusing. But that day when he raised his hands on you... We put our future on the line because I stood up for you, Rohini. Vayu. Please don't talk about it, please. Yes, I can forgive him today. But you... I told you before you left that there would be consequences. I want you to resign. You can't, Vayu... I can. When we left, I looked after you, too, you know. No matter what, I stood by you, supported you. I'm the captain of the Mavericks and I've made my decision.
