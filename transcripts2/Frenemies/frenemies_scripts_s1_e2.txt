 KAMISHA LOVED KAYLA. SHE REALLY CARED A LOT ABOUT HER. Colter-Henry: KAYLA -- SHE OPENED UP TO KAMISHA. SHE LOOKED UP TO HER. Narrator: KAMISHA TAKES KAYLA UNDER HER WING, AND THEY BECOME CLOSE FRIENDS. BUT ONE DAY, THIS WILL LEAD TO DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES. THE YEARS GO BY, AND KAYLA AND KAMISHA'S FRIENDSHIP FLOURISHES. BUT THE GIRLS GROW EVEN CLOSER WHEN KAMISHA FALLS IN LOVE WITH KAYLA'S OLDER BROTHER, RAMEL. KAMISHA WAS HEAD OVER HEELS FOR HIM. KAMISHA AND RAMEL WERE, LIKE, ATTACHED AT THE HIP. Narrator: SOON, KAMISHA MOVES IN WITH RAMEL AND KAYLA AND THE TWO GIRLS SPEND EVEN MORE TIME TOGETHER. Colter-Henry: ONE YEAR, KAMISHA WENT OUT AND BOUGHT A CHRISTMAS TREE, SOME PRESENTS, SOME DECORATIONS AND STUFF. SHE SAID, "THEY HAVEN'T HAD A CHRISTMAS LIKE THIS "SINCE THEIR MOM PASSED AWAY, AND I ALWAYS WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE A FAMILY." Narrator: BY THE TIME KAMISHA FINISHES HIGH SCHOOL IN 2006, SHE AND KAYLA ARE SO CLOSE, THEY'RE LIKE FAMILY. AND THEY TREATED EACH OTHER LIKE SISTERS. Narrator: BUT THEIR FRIENDSHIP BEGINS TO CHANGE AS THEIR LIVES START TO GO IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. HARDWORKING AND AMBITIOUS, KAMISHA LANDS A SCHOLARSHIP TO COLLEGE AND WORKS FULL TIME. SHE WAS ON THE HONOR ROLL. SHE HAD PERFECT ATTENDANCE. SHE WAS A BOOKWORM. KAMISHA WAS A BOOKWORM. SHE ALWAYS HAD IN HER MIND WHERE SHE WANTED TO GO, AND SHE WORKED VERY HARD TO GET THERE. Schneiqua: SHE KNEW THAT IF YOU WANT IT, YOU CAN'T JUST SIT DOWN HERE AND WAIT FOR IT. YOU GOT TO GET OUT THERE, AND YOU GOT TO GO GET IT. Narrator: KAYLA, ON THE OTHER HAND, JUST HANGS OUT IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND SKIPS SCHOOL. KAYLA WAS ENROLLED IN SCHOOL, BUT SHE WASN'T REALLY GOING. Narrator: WHEN KAYLA FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A BAD CROWD, KAMISHA WORRIES SHE WILL DESTROY HER CHANCES FOR A GOOD FUTURE. THEN ONE DAY IN 2009, KAMISHA'S WORST FEARS ARE CONFIRMED. 16-YEAR-OLD KAYLA CONFIDES TO KAMISHA THAT SHE IS IN TROUBLE. KAMISHA CALLED ME ONE DAY AND WAS LIKE, "MOM... I NEED TO TALK TO YOU." I SAID, "OKAY." SHE SAID, "KAYLA'S PREGNANT." I'M PREGNANT. AND I SAID, "OH, WOW." Schneiqua: KAYLA WAS SCARED. I NEVER SEEN NOTHING LIKE IT. Narrator: KAYLA IS TERRIFIED TO HAVE A BABY AND RAISE IT ON HER OWN. AS SHE HAS ALWAYS DONE, KAYLA LEANS ON KAMISHA FOR SUPPORT, AND KAMISHA HELPS HER FRIEND. Donelle: WHEN KAYLA GOT PREGNANT, I DON'T EVEN THINK SHE EVER BEEN TO THE DOCTOR. MY SISTER TOOK HER TO HER FIRST DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT. Narrator: KAMISHA TAKES CARE OF HER BEST FRIEND, KAYLA, THROUGHOUT HER PREGNANCY. Colter-Henry: IN HER HEART, THAT WAS HER FAMILY. "I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF MY FAMILY." Narrator: THEN IN 2010, BABY ALEX IS BORN, AND KAMISHA STARTS TAKING CARE OF HIM, TOO. Colter-Henry: KAMISHA WOULD SAY, "I'M GETTING READY TO GO GIVE KAYLA SOME MONEY "FOR THE BABY. I'M GONNA GO BUY BABY ALEX SOMETHING." Donelle: KAMISHA DID A LOT FOR KAYLA AS FAR AS GIVING HER MONEY FOR FOOD WHEN SHE NEEDED IT, BUYING BABY PAMPERS AND MILK. Narrator: BUT THERE ARE STRINGS ATTACHED TO THE MONEY. KAMISHA STARTS TELLING KAYLA HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS. SHE THINKS SHE'S BEING A GOOD FRIEND, BUT KAYLA STARTS TO RESENT HER ADVICE. I'M JUST SAYING, BREAST FEEDING CAN HELP YOU LOSE SOME OF THAT BABY FAT. Schneiqua: KAMISHA WAS TRYING TO BE MORE LIKE OF A BIG SISTER. BUT KAYLA WASN'T REALLY LOOKING FOR THAT. KAYLA'S AT A POINT WHERE SHE'S THINKING IN HER HEAD, "WELL, I'M THE MOTHER. THIS IS MY BABY." Narrator: FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER, CRACKS START TO SHOW IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP. BUT DESPITE KAYLA'S DEEPENING RESENTMENT, SHE STILL LOOKS TO HER FRIEND KAMISHA FOR MONEY. I NEED $20. Donelle: KAYLA WOULD ASK TO BORROW THESE THINGS. "OH, KAMISHA, CAN I BORROW MONEY SO I CAN GO GET ALEX SOME MILK?" Narrator: KAYLA ASKS FOR MORE AND MORE LOANS, BUT SHE DOESN'T BOTHER TO PAY THE MONEY BACK. KAMISHA STARTS TO FEEL HER BEST FRIEND IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER. Schneiqua: I WOULD ALWAYS TELL KAMISHA, "YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM. YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF AT THE END OF THE DAY, KAMISHA." Simon: EVEN RAMEL WOULD BE LIKE, "OH, YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH. YOU NEED TO STOP." WHY ARE YOU BUYING ALL THIS? Narrator: BUT KAYLA CAN'T TAKE CARE OF THE BABY ON HER OWN. KAMISHA FEELS SHE HAS NO CHOICE BUT TO HELP. Colter-Henry: HER HEART WOULD NOT ALLOW HER TO STOP BECAUSE SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE'S GONNA DO WHAT SHE HAS TO DO TO HELP OUT WITH THE BABY. Narrator: BUT THE MORE KAYLA DEPENDS ON HER FRIEND KAMISHA FOR MONEY, THE MORE ANGRY SHE BECOMES. SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL MY SISTER, "OH, I WISH WE COULD JUST STEP BACK." Narrator: KAMISHA AND KAYLA HAVE BEEN FRIENDS FOR LIFE, BUT NOW THEIR RESENTMENTS TOWARD EACH OTHER START TO SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT THE ARGUMENT WAS SO SEVERE AS TO WHERE IT WOULD ESCALATE -- NEVER. Narrator: KAYLA AND KAMISHA ARE HEADED FOR A DEADLY CONFRONTATION. NO ONE KNEW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN NEXT. AND IT JUST GOES TO SHOW THAT YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT A PERSON IS CAPABLE OF. Narrator: KAYLA AND KAMISHA HAVE BEEN CLOSE FRIENDS SINCE CHILDHOOD. IF ANYONE COULD GET THROUGH TO KAYLA, IT WOULD BE KAMISHA. THEY LOVED EACH OTHER. Narrator: BUT WHEN KAYLA HAS A BABY, THEIR FRIENDSHIP STARTS TO FALL APART. KAYLA IS SICK OF BEING BOSSED AROUND BY KAMISHA. KAYLA FEELS LIKE SHE'S ALWAYS BEING A PUSHOVER. Narrator: AND KAMISHA THINKS KAYLA IS AN UNGRATEFUL MOOCH. Donelle: KAMISHA STARTED TO FEEL LIKE SHE WAS BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. Narrator: BUT AS THEIR FRIENDSHIP HANGS BY A THREAD, KAMISHA MOVES FORWARD WITH HER LIFE. ON MAY 27, 2010, SHE GRADUATES FROM JOHN JAY COLLEGE, THE FIRST PERSON IN HER FAMILY TO RECEIVE A COLLEGE DEGREE. Schneiqua: EVERYBODY LOOKED UP TO KAMISHA. WHO COULDN'T LOOK UP TO HER? A PERSON COMING FROM CYPRESS HILLS PROJECTS, GOING TO HIGH SCHOOL, FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL, FINISHING COLLEGE, GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE. EVERYBODY WAS PROUD TO SEE THAT IN HER. EVERYBODY. WHOO! OH! [ LAUGHTER ] Narrator: EVERYBODY, IT SEEMS, EXCEPT KAYLA. SHE CAN'T EVEN HIDE THE BITTERNESS SHE FEELS TOWARDS HER FRIEND. Schneiqua: WE WENT ALONG TO GO TAKE THE GRADUATION PICTURES FOR COLLEGE, SO KAYLA CAME ALONG. WE'RE SMILING. WE'RE TALKING. I TURN AND LOOK BACK AT KAYLA. KAYLA HAD THIS FACE LOOK AS IF, "I COULD BE SOMEWHERE ELSE RIGHT NOW." Narrator: KAYLA MAY BE ACTING LIKE SHE DOESN'T CARE, BUT SECRETLY, SHE ENVIES HER FRIEND. THEY STARTED LIFE TOGETHER IN THE PROJECTS. NOW KAMISHA IS ON HER WAY TO A BETTER LIFE WHILE KAYLA'S FUTURE AS A SINGLE MOTHER LOOKS BLEAK. KAYLA WAS JEALOUS OF MY SISTER BECAUSE MY SISTER HAD EVERYTHING THAT SHE WANTED. Narrator: AND BECAUSE KAMISHA IS DOING SO WELL, KAYLA FEELS EVEN MORE ENTITLED TO ASK FOR HELP. AND KAMISHA KEEPS HELPING, AS SHE HAS ALWAYS DONE. Colter-Henry: I WOULD TELL KAMISHA, "YOU HAVE TO LET EVERYONE GROW UP "AND STAND ON THEIR OWN TWO FEET. IF YOU KEEP DOING FOR PEOPLE, YOU'RE ENABLING THEM." Narrator: EVEN THOUGH KAMISHA IS RESENTFUL THAT SHE'S BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED, SHE CAN'T SAY NO WHEN IT COMES TO THE BABY. WHATEVER SHE CAN DO TO HELP BABY ALEX, KAMISHA DID IT. SHE LOVED THE BABY. KAMISHA LOVED THE BABY. Narrator: BUT THEN IT ALL COMES CRASHING DOWN ONE DAY WHEN KAMISHA FINDS OUT THAT THE MONEY SHE HAS BEEN GIVING TO HER BEST FRIEND DOESN'T ALWAYS GO TO THE BABY. KAMISHA GAVE KAYLA $20 TO BUY BABY ALEX SOME MILK. SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER, KAYLA DIDN'T GO BUY THE MILK. KAMISHA THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL KAYLA, "SINCE YOU DIDN'T DO THE RIGHT THING BY THE BABY, I WANT MY MONEY BACK." Narrator: KAYLA IMMEDIATELY GOES ON THE DEFENSIVE. NOT ONLY DOES SHE REFUSE TO GIVE KAMISHA BACK HER MONEY. SHE GOES ON THE INTERNET AND POSTS NASTY COMMENTS ABOUT HER FOR ALL TO SEE. Schneiqua: KAYLA STARTED WRITING ON FACEBOOK, "I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE'S CALLING ME, ASKING ME FOR SOME PUNK-ASS MONEY," AND ALL THIS. KAMISHA IS OUTRAGED. THE FRIEND SHE TOOK UNDER HER WING SINCE THEY WERE LITTLE GIRLS IS NOW TAKING ADVANTAGE OF HER. KAMISHA SAID, "I'M TIRED OF BEING USED." "I'M TIRED OF KAYLA TAKING MY KINDNESS FOR WEAKNESS, AND I'M NOT GONNA HAVE IT NO MORE." Narrator: BUT KAYLA FEELS SHE IS FINALLY STANDING UP TO KAMISHA. SHE'S NOT GONNA LET HER FRIEND TELL HER WHAT TO DO ANYMORE. KAYLA FELT LIKE, "OKAY, I HAVE A VOICE. I GET TO SPEAK NOW." Narrator: THE SIMMERING RESENTMENTS BETWEEN KAYLA AND KAMISHA HAVE REACHED THEIR BOILING POINT. Schneiqua: I NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A FIGHT ERUPTING BETWEEN KAMISHA AND KAYLA. Narrator: IN FACT, THEY ARE HEADED FOR A PUBLIC SHOWDOWN, AND THERE'S NO TURNING BACK NOW. BY THAT TIME, IT ESCALATED UP TO ANGER AND RAGE, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF A RAGE IT WAS. Narrator: ALTHOUGH KAYLA AND KAMISHA HAVE LIVED TOGETHER LIKE SISTERS FOR YEARS, THEY ARE ON THEIR WAY TO BECOMING BITTER ENEMIES. KAYLA POSTS NASTY COMMENTS ABOUT KAMISHA ALL OVER THE INTERNET. EVEN THOUGH SHE OWES HER FRIEND $20, SHE'S TIRED OF KAMISHA ALWAYS HAVING THE UPPER HAND. Simon: KAMISHA FELT LIKE, "I'M TIRED OF ME ALWAYS HELPING YOU, AND YOU'RE SLAPPING ME IN MY FACE." Narrator: TO RETALIATE, KAMISHA FIRES A POST RIGHT BACK AT KAYLA. Simon: KAMISHA SAID, "YOU DON'T DO [BLEEP] FOR NO ONE, "SO, YEAH, I WILL BE NEEDING THAT $20. THIS IS THE LAST TIME YOU WILL CON ME INTO GIVING YOU MONEY." Narrator: SUDDENLY, KAYLA FEARS SHE'S GOING TO LOSE THIS FIGHT AND BE PUBLICLY HUMILIATED. Simon: KAYLA RESPONDED, "DON'T TRY TO EXPOSE ME, MAMA." Narrator: NOW SHE WANTS TO CONFRONT KAMISHA FACE-TO-FACE. Simon: KAYLA SAID, "I'M NOT THE TYPE TO THUG IT OUT OVER FACEBOOK. SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HOME FROM WORK." KAMISHA SAID, "LAUGH MY ASS OFF, GIRL. BYE. I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU LATER. JUST BRING THE MONEY." KAYLA SAID, "I AIN'T COMING TO TALK." RIGHT THERE, THAT'S A THREAT. I'M LIKE, "BUT, KAMISHA, SHE DON'T SOUND LIKE SHE'S PLAYING." Narrator: WHILE KAMISHA'S AT WORK, KAYLA SEETHES WITH ANGER AT HOME. SHE COOKS UP A TWISTED PLAN THAT NOBODY COULD HAVE IMAGINED. I BELIEVE THE RAGE JUST CONTINUED INSIDE OF KAYLA. Narrator: WHEN KAMISHA ARRIVES HOME THAT NIGHT, KAYLA IS LYING IN WAIT WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS. Colter-Henry: I BELIEVE THAT THEY WANTED TO JUST SEE A FIGHT. I GUESS SHE DIDN'T WANT THEM TO THINK THAT SHE WAS JUST ALL TALK. GUESS SHE WANTED THEM TO ACTUALLY SEE. Narrator: KAMISHA'S SURPRISED, BUT SHE'S NOT AFRAID OF KAYLA AND HER FRIENDS. Simon: I THINK AT THAT POINT, KAMISHA WANTED HER TO STOP SHOWING OFF. Narrator: KAMISHA DECIDES SHE'S GOING TO GET HER MONEY BACK ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. WITNESSES SAY SHE OPENS THE REFRIGERATOR AND POURS A BOTTLE OF BABY FORMULA ON THE FLOOR. AND SHE SAID, "WE'RE EVEN NOW. I HAVE MY $20." Narrator: SHOCKED, EVERYONE WATCHES AND WAITS FOR KAYLA'S REACTION. THE LIFELONG FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN KAMISHA AND KAYLA IS AS GOOD AS OVER, BUT NO ONE COULD PREDICT THE DEADLY EVENTS THAT ARE ABOUT TO UNFOLD. Colter-Henry: I KNOW KAMISHA'S MOUTH, AND I KNEW HER ATTITUDE, BUT NOT FOR A MILLION YEARS WOULD I HAVE EVER BELIEVED FOR KAYLA TO ACT IN SUCH A WAY. I NEVER WOULD HAVE EXPECTED WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. A PERSON CAN TAKE ONLY SO MUCH OF ONE'S AGGRAVATION. EVERYONE HAS THEIR BOILING POINT. Richards: CALM DOWN! Narrator: THE LIFELONG FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN BEST FRIENDS KAYLA AND KAMISHA HAS DISSOLVED INTO HATRED. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] NO, YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN. YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN. KAYLA WAS REACTING OFF EMBARRASSMENT. KAMISHA WAS FINALLY FED UP. WHEN BOTH CLASHED, IT BECAME A NASTY EXCHANGE. Narrator: NOW THAT THEY'RE FACE-TO-FACE, THE ANGER EXPLODES. Schneiqua: NEXT THING YOU KNOW, KAYLA AND KAMISHA GETS TO FIGHTING. Narrator: THE FIGHT TURNS VIOLENT, BUT KAYLA DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST KAMISHA. Donelle: KAMISHA WAS GETTING THE BEST OF HER. Narrator: KAMISHA IS BIGGER AND STRONGER, AND KAYLA STARTS LOSING THE FIGHT SHE WANTED HER FRIENDS TO WITNESS. YOU BRING ALL YOUR FRIENDS OVER, AND IN YOUR MIND, YOU'RE EXPECTING TO WIN, AND YOU DON'T. Narrator: SUDDENLY, THE GROUP OF FRIENDS SEES KAMISHA DASH TO HER BEDROOM WITH KAYLA RIGHT BEHIND HER. KAYLA RAN INTO THE BACK ROOM WHERE MY SISTER WAS. Narrator: AND IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE, YEARS OF LOVING FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO IS FORGOTTEN. AND THE HATRED TURNS DEADLY. SHE STABBED MY SISTER ONCE. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] SHE STABBED HER. I GUESS SHE MUST'VE SEEN BLOOD. THE KNIFE PENETRATED HER RIGHT THROUGH HER HEART. Narrator: AFTER KAYLA STABS KAMISHA, SHE SUDDENLY RACES FROM THE APARTMENT, PAST HER STUNNED FRIENDS. SHE MUST HAVE PANICKED AND RAN OUT THE HOUSE. Narrator: MOMENTS LATER, KAMISHA STAGGERS FROM THE BACK ROOM. MY SISTER CAME OUT THE ROOM, LIKE, "SHE STABBED ME. SHE STABBED ME. I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE STABBED ME." HER WORDS STARTED TO SLUR. AND SHE STARTED TO FAINT. AND THE ONLY THING SHE WAS SAYING WAS, "OH, GOD. OH, GOD." Narrator: ONE OF THE WITNESSES CALLS 911. JUST THEN, KAMISHA'S BOYFRIEND, RAMEL, COMES HOME AND FINDS KAMISHA BLEEDING AND UNCONSCIOUS. HE SEEN MY SISTER LAYING THERE. SHE WASN'T MOVING. RAMEL FELT ANGRY BECAUSE ANY OTHER DAY, HE WOULD BE IN THE HOUSE. HE WOULD BE HOME. Narrator: AN AMBULANCE RUSHES KAMISHA TO THE HOSPITAL. [ SIREN WAILING ] [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] Colter-Henry: MY PHONE RUNG. KAMISHA NAME POPPED UP. I SAID, "HEY, KAMISHA. WHAT YOU DOING?" HE SAID, "NO, IT'S NOT KAMISHA. IT'S RAMEL." RAMEL? "I JUST NEED YOU TO COME TO BROOKLYN. KAMISHA HAD A FIGHT, AND SHE GOT STABBED." OH, MY GOD. Narrator: LITTLE DOES KAMISHA'S MOTHER KNOW THAT HER BEST FRIEND, KAYLA, IS THE ONE WHO STABBED HER. Colter-Henry: I WENT TO BROOKDALE HOSPITAL. I SAID, "EXCUSE ME. I NEED TO SEE ABOUT MY DAUGHTER." I TURNED TO MY LEFT. I SEE OFFICERS BLOCKING A HOSPITAL ROOM. KAMISHA?! KAMISHA?! I STARTED CALLING HER NAME. "KAMISHA. KAMISHA, I'M HERE." I'M LIKE, "WHY SHE'S NOT ANSWERING ME?" WHAT'S GOING ON?! [ Voice breaking ] AND I ASKED THE OFFICERS... I SAID, "IS MY DAUGHTER GONE?" AND HE JUST GRABBED MY HAND. AND HE SAID... AND I FELL TO THE FLOOR. [ Crying ] NO! Narrator: BACK AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME, POLICE QUESTION WITNESSES. THEY FOLLOW A TRAIL OF BLOOD TO A BUILDING NEXT DOOR, WHERE THEY FIND KAYLA AT A NEIGHBOR'S APARTMENT. AND THEN ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER... KAYLA TELLS POLICE THAT SHE GRABBED THE KNIFE IN SELF-DEFENSE AFTER KAMISHA ATTACKED HER. KAYLA SAID MY SISTER TRIED TO COME AT HER WITH SCISSORS, SO SHE PICKED UP A KNIFE, AND SHE TRIED TO PROTECT HERSELF. Narrator: BUT POLICE ARREST KAYLA AND CHARGE HER WITH SECOND-DEGREE MURDER. TODAY, SHE REMAINS IN PRISON, AWAITING TRIAL. KAYLA CLAIMS SHE ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE AND IS PLEADING NOT GUILTY. HER TRIAL DATE HAS NOT BEEN SET, BUT SHE IS CONSIDERED INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. A LIFELONG FRIENDSHIP HAS BEEN DESTROYED AND TWO LIVES WASTED BY A FIGHT THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED. NOW SOMEONE'S DEAD, AND NOW SOMEONE'S IN JAIL. Narrator: FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE STILL SHOCKED THAT KAMISHA IS GONE AND SUCH A PROMISING LIFE IS CUT SHORT. I JUST FEEL KAMISHA WAS TOO MUCH OF A GOOD SOUL. SHE WAS TOO MUCH OF A PURE SOUL FOR THIS TO HAVE HAPPENED TO HER. Donelle: KAMISHA WAS A BIG PERSONALITY IN MY FAMILY. WHEN SHE LEFT, IT WAS A TRAGEDY BECAUSE SHE HAD SO MUCH GOING FOR HERSELF. KAMISHA INSPIRED A LOT OF PEOPLE. SHE REALLY TOUCHED A LOT OF LIVES, AND IT HAS DEVASTATED A LOT OF PEOPLE. NOT ONLY HER LIFE ENDED, BUT SEVERAL OTHER DREAMS ENDED, TOO. Narrator: TODAY, KAMISHA'S FAMILY HAS STARTED A FOUNDATION THAT HONORS HER MEMORY, BUT THEY STILL STRUGGLE TO SWALLOW THIS BITTER TRUTH. KAYLA, THE FRIEND KAMISHA HAD ALWAYS HELPED AND PROTECTED, TURNED OUT TO BE HER GREATEST ENEMY. [ Voice breaking ] THERE'S HURT AND JUST BETRAYAL THAT SOMEBODY THAT SHE TOOK UNDER HER WING LIKE A SISTER DID THAT TO HER. YOU NEVER KNOW. YOU CAN BE A FRIEND TODAY. A FRIEND TODAY CAN BE YOUR ENEMY TOMORROW. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
