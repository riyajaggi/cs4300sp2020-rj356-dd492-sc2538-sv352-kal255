 THEIR HOUSES WERE ABOUT A MILE DOWN THE ROAD FROM EACH OTHER. Narrator: LIKE CRYSTAL, KEN IS WELL-KNOWN AND LIKED IN THEIR SMALL TOWN. JUST A GOOD OL' REDNECK SOUTHERN BOY WHO LIKED TO HANG OUT ON THE WEEKENDS WITH HIS FRIENDS AND BE OUT IN THE WOODS AND LIKED TO GO HUNTING AND FISHING. HE WAS AT CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY -- PLAYED HIS GUITAR IN THE CHURCH CHOIR. IF YOU EVER NEEDED ANYTHING, HE WOULD GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO TAKE CARE OF YOU OR HELP YOU. A LOT OF TIMES, HE WOULD COME OVER JUST TO SAY "HEY," TO HANG OUT. SHE ENJOYED BEING AROUND HIM BECAUSE HE WAS FUN. Narrator: THE TWO NEVER DATE, BUT BY THE TIME THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL, CRYSTAL AND KEN ARE INSEPARABLE. HE WOULD PICK HER UP AND TAKE HER TO SCHOOL BEFORE SHE GOT HER CAR. THEY WOULD HANG OUT AND GO OUT TO EAT. THEY WOULD GO OVER TO A FRIEND'S POOL, AND THEY WOULD PLAY CHICKEN AND WRESTLE AROUND AND DUNK EACH OTHER IN THE WATER AND JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME. Narrator: QUICKLY, KEN BECOMES A REGULAR AT SUNDAY DINNERS, AND SOON, IT'S LIKE HE'S ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY. Alsdorf: WE WOULD HAVE DINNERS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON, AND HE WOULD JUST WALK RIGHT IN, WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO KNOCK ON THE DOOR. James: KEN WAS CONSIDERED FAMILY. EVERYBODY JUST THOUGHT HE WAS A GREAT GUY. Narrator: BUT LITTLE DOES ANYONE KNOW THAT KEN AND CRYSTAL'S CLOSE BOND WILL LEAD TO A SHOCKING SERIES OF EVENTS. THREE YEARS GO BY AND THE TWO FRIENDS REMAIN CLOSE BUT BEGIN LEADING VERY DIFFERENT LIVES. KEN GRADUATES FROM HIGH SCHOOL. HE WORKS DURING THE DAY AND TAKES COLLEGE COURSES AT NIGHT. James: HE WAS WORKING WITH AN ELECTRICAL COMPANY. HE WAS READY FOR THE REAL WORLD, TO START A LIFE OF HIS OWN. Narrator: CRYSTAL, NOW A SENIOR, IS THINKING ABOUT HER FUTURE. CRYSTAL WANTED TO GO AWAY TO SCHOOL. I THINK SHE WANTED TO MEET NEW PEOPLE. SHE WANTED TO BE A LAB TECHNICIAN. SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. Narrator: BUT FOR NOW, CRYSTAL IS ENJOYING HER LAST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL. Alsdorf: SHE WOULD LOVE TO GO OUT WITH HER FRIENDS AND HAVE A GOOD TIME. Narrator: ONE SATURDAY NIGHT IN NOVEMBER, CRYSTAL GOES TO A PARTY... SHE DECIDED TO GO MEET HER FRIENDS. CRYSTAL WAS IN A VERY GOOD MOOD THAT AFTERNOON. Narrator: ...BUT NO ONE COULD HAVE FORESEEN HOW THE SEEMINGLY INNOCENT NIGHT OUT WILL CHANGE EVERYONE'S LIVES FOREVER. YOU KNOW, SHE'D HAD A GOOD TIME, AND SHE WAS THEN GOING HOME. Narrator: CRYSTAL HAD A CURFEW AT MIDNIGHT. AUNT BONNIE FAYE TRUSTED HER, AND SHE KNEW THAT IF SHE TOLD HER TO BE HOME AT A CERTAIN TIME, SHE WOULD DO IT. Narrator: BUT HER MIDNIGHT CURFEW COMES AND GOES, AND CRYSTAL DOESN'T ARRIVE. HER MOTHER IS WORRIED SICK. SOMETHING JUST TOLD ME THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH CRYSTAL. CRYSTAL'S MOM IMMEDIATELY CALLS HER BEST FRIEND, KEN. Knowles: KEN WAS WORRIED. HE MADE SOME PHONE CALLS TRYING TO FIND CRYSTAL'S WHEREABOUTS. HE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE IN TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE SHE WAS. Narrator: WHEN CRYSTAL STILL ISN'T HOME BY 8:00 A.M., EVERYONE'S AT THEIR WITS' END. HER MOTHER CALLS THE POLICE, WHO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN A FULL-SCALE SEARCH. Knowles: SHE WAS OBVIOUSLY FRANTIC. YOU COULD HEAR THE PANIC IN HER VOICE AND THE FEAR THAT SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO HER DAUGHTER. [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: WHEN POLICE FIND CRYSTAL'S ABANDONED CAR IN A SCHOOL PARKING LOT, THEY'RE RELIEVED... WE REALLY, TRULY THOUGHT SHE WOULD BE FINE. THERE WAS HOPE. Narrator: ...BUT NO ONE COULD IMAGINE THE NIGHTMARE TO COME. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST ANY FOUL PLAY. PEOPLE WANTED ANSWERS. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE WAS NO ONE TO GIVE THEM ANY ANSWERS. WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED? I NEVER SAW IT COMING. I MEAN, IT WAS A TOTAL SHOCK. Narrator: WHEN POLICE FIND CRYSTAL'S CAR ABANDONED IN A PARKING LOT, THEY HOPE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO FIND HER SOON. THE VEHICLE WAS LOCKED. HER POCKETBOOK WAS FOUND IN THE REAR OF THE CAR. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER OF ANY STRUGGLE. WE JUST THOUGHT THAT SHE MAYBE HAD HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK OR WAS STAYING WITH A FRIEND. Narrator: BY SUNRISE, CRYSTAL IS STILL MISSING. INVESTIGATORS BECOME MORE CONCERNED AND STEP UP THEIR SEARCH. THE POLICE WERE VERY TIGHTLIPPED ABOUT IT AND RIGHTFULLY SO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY THEIR HAND AND GIVE UP ANY INFORMATION THAT WAS GOING TO HINDER THE INVESTIGATION. [ SIREN WAILING ] Narrator: BUT EVERYONE'S HOPES OF FINDING CRYSTAL ARE DASHED BY 10:00 A.M. WHEN INVESTIGATORS RECEIVE A CALL FROM TWO HUNTERS WHO FOUND THE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN IN THE WOODS SEVERAL MILES OUTSIDE OF TOWN. THE CRIME SCENE TECHNICIAN REMOVED A RING FROM THE VICTIM, AND INSIDE WAS THE INSCRIPTION, "CRYSTAL FAYE TODD." Narrator: THERE IS NO DOUBT CRYSTAL HAS BEEN MURDERED. CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS ALSO FIND EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. Knowles: HER SHIRT WAS OPEN, HER BRA WAS PUSHED UP, HER PANTS WERE UNBUTTONED AND PARTIALLY DOWN IN THE BACK. IT WAS VERY OBVIOUS THAT HER CLOTHING HAD BEEN TORN. Narrator: EVEN POLICE ARE SHOCKED AT THE VIOLENT MANNER IN WHICH CRYSTAL HAD BEEN KILLED. IT WAS CLEAR THAT HER THROAT WAS CUT IN SUCH A MANNER THAT HER HEAD WAS ALMOST DECAPITATED. [ Voice breaking ] SHE HAD HER THROAT SLIT FROM ONE EAR TO THE OTHER. THE ONLY THING HOLDING ON HER HEAD WAS HER SPINAL COLUMN. SHE WAS SLASHED FROM HER PELVIC BONE UP TO HER BREAST BONE. Knowles: IT WAS A SLOW, AGONIZING DEATH. THE WAY HER BODY WAS DISCARDED -- IT WAS JUST LIKE IT WAS TRASH THROWN OUT. Narrator: CRYSTAL HAD BEEN STABBED OVER 30 TIMES. IT WAS JUST A GRUESOME, GRUESOME PICTURE. [ POLICE RADIO CHATTER ] Knowles: IT WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE WORST CRIME SCENES -- NOT A SIGHT I'LL FORGET. Narrator: POLICE RELUCTANTLY DELIVER THE TRAGIC NEWS TO CRYSTAL'S FAMILY. [ Crying ] I REMEMBER THE PHONE RINGING AND MY MOM ANSWERED THE PHONE, AND THE NEXT THING SHE SAID, "OH, NO, CRYSTAL'S DEAD. SHE'S BEEN MURDERED." I REMEMBER AUNT BONNIE FAYE LYING ON THE FLOOR, CRYING... ...SAYING, YOU KNOW, "THAT'S MY BABY. WHO COULD KILL MY BABY?" Bonnie Faye: THE NIGHT I FOUND OUT ABOUT CRYSTAL WAS THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE. I WANTED TO DIE, TOO. Narrator: CRYSTAL'S BEST FRIEND, KEN, IS DEVASTATED, TOO. Drews: KEN BECAME ILL. HE BECAME VIOLENTLY, PHYSICALLY ILL. HOW COULD SOMEBODY DO SUCH A THING? WHAT KIND OF COLD AND CALLOUS INDIVIDUAL COULD DO WHAT THEY DID TO CRYSTAL? Narrator: POLICE ARE HELL-BENT ON CATCHING HER KILLER AND IMMEDIATELY LAUNCH A MASSIVE INVESTIGATION. THERE WAS A HUGE CLOUD OF FEAR AROUND THE COMMUNITY. Narrator: A DISTRAUGHT KEN ALSO HELPS POLICE IN THEIR SEARCH. KEN VOLUNTEERED TO HELP ON THE CASE IN ANY WAY THAT HE COULD. Narrator: AS THE FAMILY MOURNS THEIR LOSS, THEY HAVE NO IDEA THERE'S MORE AGONY YET TO COME AND THAT THE GRIEF THEY'RE FEELING NOW IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF UNIMAGINABLE HEARTBREAK. EVERYBODY WAS IN SHOCK. WE DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT. NOBODY WOULD EVER THINK THAT SOMETHING -- THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN CONWAY. James: IT'S THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. YOU CAN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THAT. Narrator: CRYSTAL'S FAMILY IS DEVASTATED WHEN THEY LEARN ABOUT HER SAVAGE MURDER. [ Voice breaking ] MY AUNT BONNIE FAYE -- SHE WAS AN EMOTIONAL WRECK. SHE -- SHE COULDN'T STAND, SHE COULDN'T WALK. James: IT WAS JUST TOTAL, TOTAL DISBELIEF. I MEAN, IT'S JUST LIKE SOMEBODY SWEEPING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER YOUR FEET AND THERE IS NOTHING TO FALL ON. IT'S JUST VERY HARD TO DEAL WITH. Narrator: AT CRYSTAL'S FUNERAL, NEARLY EVERYONE IN THE SMALL TOWN COMES TO SAY THEIR HEARTFELT GOODBYES. James: IT WAS THE BIGGEST FUNERAL I'VE SEEN. I MEAN, YOU HAD HALF THE HIGH SCHOOL THERE. SO PEOPLE FELT SO BAD. YOU KNOW, THEY JUST WANTED TO GO SHOW THEIR SUPPORT. Alsdorf: EVERYBODY WAS IN SHOCK. AUNT BONNIE FAYE JUST CONSTANTLY CRIED IN DISBELIEF. CRYSTAL'S BEST FRIEND, KEN, IS ONE OF THE PALLBEARERS. HE WAS VISIBLY UPSET AT THE FUNERAL. Alsdorf: KEN WAS HANGING HIS HEAD DOWN A LOT, LIKE HE WAS THINKING A LOT IN PAIN AND ANGER. HE PUT HER CASKET ON TOP OF THE GRAVE, AND I REMEMBER HIM JUST STANDING THERE AND KIND OF PAUSING FOR A MINUTE AND PLACING A FLOWER ON HER CASKET, JUST SLOWLY WALKING AWAY. Narrator: AND AFTER THE FUNERAL, KEN STAYS IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH CRYSTAL'S FAMILY. KEN JUST STARTED COMING BY, STOPPING BY BONNIE FAYE'S HOUSE EVERY DAY, PRETTY MUCH ASKING BONNIE FAYE, "HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING?" HE WAS SHOWING CONCERN, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO CONSOLE PEOPLE. Narrator: IN THE DAYS AFTER THE FUNERAL, THE SEARCH FOR CRYSTAL'S KILLER CONTINUES. Alsdorf: THE FIRST THING WE THOUGHT WAS, "SOME STRANGER HAS COME INTO TOWN AND HAS DONE THIS." THE FEAR THAT PERMEATED WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY WAS VERY PALPABLE. Narrator: WITH NO SOLID LEADS, POLICE RAMP UP EFFORTS TO FIND CRYSTAL'S KILLER. Alsdorf: THEY WERE MORE DETERMINED TO FIND WHO COULD BRUTALLY KILL SOMEONE IN THIS WAY, TO GET THIS PERSON OFF THE STREETS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Drews: THEY WENT AT IT NONSTOP BECAUSE AS FAR AS THEY KNEW, THIS HAD THE EVIDENCE OF A SERIAL KILLER. [ SIREN WAILS ] Knowles: DNA EVIDENCE WAS RECOVERED, BLOOD SPATTER EVIDENCE WAS ALSO TAKEN. THEY WERE TAKING SEVERAL DIFFERENT BLOOD SAMPLES AND HAIR SAMPLES FROM GUYS WHO THEY THOUGHT COULD BE SUSPECTS. Narrator: POLICE INTERVIEW MORE THAN 400 PEOPLE, INCLUDING CRYSTAL'S CLASSMATES AND HER GOOD FRIEND, KEN. HE WAS VERY FORTHRIGHT TO THE INVESTIGATORS. HE VOLUNTEERED INFORMATION. Narrator: THEN ON FEBRUARY 15, 1992, 3 MONTHS AFTER CRYSTAL'S MURDER, DETECTIVES GET THE DNA RESULTS BACK AND FINALLY DISCOVER WHO COMMITTED THE HORRIFIC CRIME. IT WAS TOTALLY UNEXPECTED. Narrator: WHEN POLICE DISCOVER THE KILLER'S IDENTITY, IT SHOCKS EVERYONE TO THEIR CORE. I MEAN, YOUR MIND'S RACING, "WHO WOULD DO SUCH A THING?" IT PUT COLD CHILLS OVER MY BODY. I DON'T THINK WORDS CAN DESCRIBE WHAT TYPE EVIL THAT REALLY IS. James: I WAS IN TOTAL SHOCK. I WOULD HAVE NEVER -- NEVER DREAMED IT. Narrator: AFTER A THREE-MONTH INVESTIGATION, DNA EVIDENCE COMES BACK AND POLICE FINALLY FIND OUT WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HORRIFIC RAPE AND MURDER OF 17-YEAR-OLD CRYSTAL TODD. UNBELIEVABLY, IT'S KEN REGISTER, CRYSTAL'S CHILDHOOD FRIEND. I NEVER SAW IT COMING. I MEAN, IT WAS A TOTAL SHOCK. HE WAS SO CLOSE TO OUR FAMILY. I WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT IN A MILLION YEARS THAT KEN REGISTER WOULD HAVE DONE THE THINGS TO HER THAT HE DID. [ SIREN WAILING ] Narrator: KEN IS IMMEDIATELY ARRESTED AND TAKEN IN FOR QUESTIONING. 5 HOURS AND 20 MINUTES AFTER WE STARTED, HE CONFESSED. KEN SAID THAT HE HAD FLAGGED DOWN CRYSTAL AT A RED LIGHT. SHE WOULDN'T HAVE HESITATED AT ALL TO STOP AND TO GET IN THE CAR WITH HIM. HE GOT HER TO GET IN THE CAR WITH HIM TO GO FOR A RIDE, AND SHE WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING ABOUT IT. NOT MUCH. I REMEMBER HIM SAYING THAT THEY WENT AND PARKED AT CONWAY MIDDLE SCHOOL FOR A LITTLE BIT. Narrator: KEN TELLS POLICE THAT AFTER BEING JUST FRIENDS FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT HE AND CRYSTAL BOTH DECIDED TO TAKE THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE NEXT LEVEL. Alsdorf: KEN SAID THAT HE FORGOT TO USE A CONDOM AND DID NOT TELL HER. HE SAID THAT SHE FREAKED OUT AND STARTED SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, "YOU'RE GONNA BE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE, YOU KNOW, IF I GET PREGNANT." AS A RESULT OF THAT, KEN BECAME SCARED... [ SCREAMING ] ...PULLED A KNIFE FROM THE CENTER CONSOLE OF HIS AUTOMOBILE AND BEGAN STABBING HER. [ SCREAMING ] Narrator: BUT POLICE HAVE REASON TO QUESTION KEN'S VERSION OF EVENTS. PHYSICAL EVIDENCE COLLECTED AT THE SCENE CONTRADICTS HIS STORY. IN THE PATHOLOGY REPORT, THE KNIFE WAS WITHDRAWN AND ENTERED BACK INTO THE SAME WOUND TO TORTURE HER. THE MAGNITUDE OF ANGER AND VIOLENCE THAT WAS PERPETRATED ON CRYSTAL WAS NOT SOMETHING OF A NORMAL NATURE. SHE HAD BEEN SODOMIZED. WHAT REALLY DISTURBS ME IS THE FACT THAT THE FORENSIC EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT THE SODOMIZING TOOK PLACE POSTMORTEM. Narrator: THROUGH THEIR INVESTIGATION, POLICE FIND OUT KEN IS HIDING A TWISTED AND DEVIANT PAST. THERE WAS A DARK SIDE TO KEN. KEN'S FRIENDS TOLD ME ABOUT SOME OF THE HUNTING TRIPS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE. THEY'D CAMP OUT AND THEY'D HUNT AND FISH, AND KEN WOULD TRAP SMALL ANIMALS AND BASICALLY TORTURE THEM -- EITHER SKIN THEM ALIVE OR SET THEM ON FIRE. Narrator: UNBEKNOWNST TO HIS FRIEND CRYSTAL, KEN WAS ADDICTED TO PORNOGRAPHY. James: AND IT WAS SOME VERY SADISTIC PORN, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. Knowles: HE WOULD STOP EVERY DAY TO BUY SOME TYPE OF PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL ON HIS WAY TO WORK. Narrator: BUT PORN ISN'T HIS ONLY SINISTER SECRET. DURING THE SUMMER OF 1988, KEN'S SEXUAL DEVIANCY BECOMES MORE AGGRESSIVE. KEN WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL PHONE CALLS TO GIRLS... THE CALLS WERE RATHER SEXUAL IN NATURE, VERY THREATENING... Alsdorf: ...AND A LOT OF THE PHONE CALLS WERE DESCRIBING WAYS HE WAS GONNA KILL THESE GIRLS. Drew: ...AND IRONICALLY, SOME OF THE THINGS WERE EERILY SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED TO CRYSTAL. THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST HAPPENSTANCE. HE HAD BEEN THINKING OF DOING THIS TO SOMEONE ALL ALONG. UNFORTUNATELY, IT JUST HAPPENED TO CRYSTAL AT THAT PARTICULAR NIGHT. HE JUST HAD THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT THEN AND THERE TO FULFILL HIS SEXUAL FANTASY, AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID. Knowles: ACCORDING TO THE PROFILERS, KEN REGISTER WAS DEFINITELY A SEXUAL DEVIANT, AND I BASE THAT ON HIS PROGRESSION OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY UP UNTIL THE POINT WHERE HE COMMITTED THIS HOMICIDE. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS BREAK THE STUNNING NEWS TO CRYSTAL'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS. EVERYBODY WAS IN SHOCK. HE WAS SO CLOSE TO OUR FAMILY. WE JUST -- WE COULD NOT BELIEVE IT. James: TOTALLY UNEXPECTED, AND SOMEBODY WE TRUSTED SO MUCH -- I MEAN... IT WAS AN AWFUL THING TO WATCH. I NEVER HAD ANY SUSPICIONS ON KEN BEING THE GUILTY PARTY. Narrator: FINDING OUT ABOUT KEN'S SEXUAL DEVIANCY ONLY ADDS TO THE FAMILY'S PAIN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW ANY HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE SO MUCH ANGER AND RAGE AND JUST PURE EVIL IN THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. James: CRYSTAL HAD NO IDEA AT ALL THAT HE WAS INTO ANY OF THIS STUFF. NOBODY IN THE FAMILY WAS EVER SUSPICIOUS. NOBODY KNEW THAT KEN HAD THIS HISTORY. Drews: HE LIED TO EVERYONE. IF THEY COULD GIVE AN ACADEMY AWARD TO KEN REGISTER, HE WOULD WIN IT HANDS DOWN BECAUSE HE HAD EVERYONE FOOLED ABOUT HIS INVOLVEMENT WITH THIS. James: HE JUST SNAPPED... [ CRYSTAL SCREAMING ] NO! ...AND THEN THAT'S WHEN THE SADISTIC SIDE OF KEN CAME OUT. Alsdorf: I BELIEVE KEN GREW INTO A MONSTER. HE TOOK THESE SICK, TWISTED FANTASIES THAT HE HAD ABOUT SEX AND TURNED IT INTO A REALITY. I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT HAD IT NOT BEEN CRYSTAL, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMEONE ELSE. HE WAS A TICKING TIME BOMB. UNFORTUNATELY, IT EXPLODED THAT NIGHT IN NOVEMBER. Narrator: 11 MONTHS LATER, KEN GOES ON TRIAL FOR THE MURDER OF HIS LONGTIME FRIEND. HE IS FOUND GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT, KIDNAPPING, AND MURDER, AND HE'S SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. HE IS JUST 19 YEARS OLD. James: HAVING TO SIT THERE AND LOOK AT HIM, ESPECIALLY WHEN I WAS ON THE STAND -- HE WOULDN'T LOOK AT ME. HE JUST HAS NO REACTION AT ALL. I MEAN, HE'S JUST COLDHEARTED. Narrator: CRYSTAL'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS STILL WONDER HOW SOMEONE THEY LOVED AND TRUSTED SO MUCH COULD HAVE BEEN SO DANGEROUS. Alsdorf: I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW HOW SOMEONE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE SUCH A GOOD FRIEND COULD TURN AND DO THE THINGS THAT KEN DID TO CRYSTAL. I MEAN, WHEN YOU TRUST SOMEONE, THE WAY WE TRUSTED HIM, AND THEN HE GOES AND TAKES THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON OUT OF YOUR LIFE, THAT'S THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. YOU CAN'T GET ANY WORSE THAN THAT.
