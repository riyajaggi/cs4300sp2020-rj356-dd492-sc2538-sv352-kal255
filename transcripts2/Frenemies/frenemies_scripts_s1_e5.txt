 14-YEAR-OLD SHANNON BRAITHWAITE AND 13-YEAR-OLD TIANA BROWNE ARE COUSINS. BUT THEIR LIVES COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT. SHANNON'S MOTHER MARVA IS STRICT BUT DEVOTED TO HER ONLY CHILD. SHANNON CAME FROM A HOME OF A SINGLE MOM WHO WORKED VERY, VERY HARD AND LONG HOURS TO SUPPORT HER CHILD. SHANNON WAS VERY CLOSE TO HER MOTHER. THAT WAS HER ONLY BABY. Narrator: TIANA'S MOTHER, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS HARDLY PRESENT IN HER LIFE. HER MOTHER WAS QUITE YOUNG WHEN SHE WAS BORN -- I THINK ABOUT 15. AND TIANA WAS RAISED BY HER GRANDMOTHER.

 Narrator: TIANA IS OFTEN LEFT TO HER OWN DEVICES, WHILE SHANNON'S HOME IS STABLE. BUT THE TWO COUSINS SHARE A LOT IN COMMON, AND THEY BECOME FRIENDS. SHANNON WAS VERY OUTGOING. SHE WAS VERY FRIENDLY. TIANA COULD BE FUNNY. SHE COULD BE WARM. Narrator: AS SHANNON AND TIANA GET OLDER, THEY GROW EVEN CLOSER. SHANNON WAS SAYING THEY WERE VERY CLOSE, AND IT WAS KIND OF LIKE COUSINS UNITING. Narrator: BUT THE BONDS THAT TIE THEM TOGETHER WILL ALSO LEAD THEM TO A DEADLY ENCOUNTER THAT LIES AHEAD. BY THE TIME TIANA AND SHANNON ENTER HIGH SCHOOL IN 2006, SHANNON IS A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT WITH A PASSION FOR WRITING. SHE WAS EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS. WHICHEVER ONE YOU WANT. SHANNON WAS WRITING, I THINK, THREE NOVELS IN 9th GRADE. [ INDISTINCT CONVERSATION ] Narrator: TIANA ALSO STARTS OFF THE SCHOOL YEAR WITH GOOD GRADES AND A POSITIVE OUTLOOK. TIANA WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING A HAPPY CHILD, WELL-ADJUSTED CHILD. SHE DID WELL IN SCHOOL. Narrator: BUT EVERYTHING CHANGES WHEN, SUDDENLY, AT THE AGE OF 13, TIANA LEARNS A TERRIBLE SECRET. THE MAN TIANA HAS ALWAYS KNOWN AS HER STEP-GRANDFATHER IS ALSO HER FATHER. SHOCKINGLY, HE RAPED HER MOTHER WHEN SHE WAS 15 YEARS OLD. AND FOR REASONS TIANA CAN'T UNDERSTAND, HER GRANDMOTHER STAYED WITH HIM AND BURIED THE TRUTH. I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE HAD ON A 13-YEAR-OLD. Narrator: AFTER SHE LEARNS THIS DISTRESSING NEWS, TIANA'S PERSONALITY CHANGES COMPLETELY. SHE BECOMES INCREASINGLY VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLABLE. IT WAS A REALLY DRAMATIC CHANGE FROM THE WAY THAT SHE WAS BEFORE. WHAT'S SO HARD ABOUT THAT, HUH? TIANA WAS PICKING FIGHTS WITH HER PEERS. SHE WAS STEALING. SHE WAS TRUANT FROM SCHOOL. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Narrator: SHANNON IS DISTRESSED TO SEE THIS DRASTIC CHANGE IN HER COUSIN AND LETS TIANA KNOW THAT SHE IS THERE WHENEVER SHE NEEDS HER. Lopez: SHANNON WAS ALWAYS THE ONE THAT WOULD SAY, "YOU CAN TALK TO ME. I CAN GIVE YOU ADVICE." SHANNON WANTED TO SHOW HER A DIFFERENT WAY TO LIVE. Narrator: SHANNON ONLY WANTS TO HELP, BUT SOON, HER HEARTFELT ADVICE STARTS TO GRATE ON TIANA'S NERVES. SHANNON WATCHES HELPLESSLY AS TIANA'S BEHAVIOR ONLY BECOMES MORE RISKY AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE. TIANA WAS SORELY TEMPTED BY OUTSIDE INFLUENCES THAT WERE NEGATIVE. TIANA PUT HERSELF IN A PLACE WHERE SHE COULD BE VICTIMIZED. Narrator: AFTER TIANA LEARNS THE SECRET ABOUT HER FATHER, SHE STARTS RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME FOR DAYS AT A TIME AND GETS HERSELF INTO DANGEROUS SITUATIONS. [ SIREN WAILS ] BY RUNNING AWAY, SHE WASN'T IN A SAFE PLACE. AND SO SHE HAD A SERIES OF VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. Narrator: SHOCKINGLY, TIANA CLAIMS SHE IS RAPED ON THREE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS WHILE ON THE STREETS. IT'S INCREDIBLY TRAUMATIZING. SHE WAS SO YOUNG. PLEASE, JUST GET AWAY FROM ME. PLEASE. GET AWAY FROM ME! Narrator: SHANNON IS HORRIFIED BY THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO HER COUSIN, AND SHE VOWS TO KEEP HELPING HER. BUT SHANNON DOESN'T REALIZE HER ACTIONS WILL DRAW THEM BOTH INTO THE EYE OF A DEADLY STORM. Paradis: WE KNOW THAT SHE HAD A LOT OF RAGE, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY THAT YOU COULD PREDICT THAT SHE WOULD BEHAVE THE WAY SHE DID. IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE. I REALLY COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT. Narrator: SHANNON'S TROUBLED FRIEND TIANA HAS SUFFERED A SERIES OF TRAUMATIC RAPES THAT HAUNT HER CONSTANTLY. TIANA WAS REPORTING FREQUENT NIGHTMARES, DIFFICULTY SLEEPING, RELIVING OF THE EVENT. Narrator: THE EMOTIONAL STRAIN IS MORE THAN THE YOUNG GIRL CAN BEAR, AND AT HOME, TIANA SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL IN UNPREDICTABLE AND FRIGHTENING FITS OF RAGE. SHE BECAME VERY ANGRY, WOULD THROW THINGS, AND ALMOST LOSE CONTROL OF HER TEMPER. I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY. ANYTHING ELSE? Narrator: THERE'S SEEMINGLY NOTHING ANYONE CAN DO TO HELP TIANA, AND HER VIOLENCE SOON BECOMES TOO MUCH FOR HER ELDERLY GRANDMOTHER TO HANDLE. HOPING TO HELP HER TROUBLED GRANDDAUGHTER, SHE REACHES OUT TO SHANNON AND HER MOTHER, MARVA. SHE FEELS THEY MAY BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH TO TIANA. Paradis: TIANA'S GRANDMOTHER ASKED IF SHE COULD MOVE IN WITH SHANNON AND SHANNON'S FAMILY. IF SHE CAN SPEND TIME WITH SHANNON, MAYBE SHE CAN SEE HOW A YOUNG LADY SHOULD ACT. Doyle: MARVA HAD DONE SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB WITH SHANNON THAT SHE THOUGHT TIANA WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT SAME LOVE AND CARE. Narrator: SHANNON URGES HER MOTHER TO LET TIANA MOVE IN WITH THEM FOR A WHILE, EVEN THOUGH HER MOTHER IS RELUCTANT. Lopez: MARVA DIDN'T WANT HER TO MOVE IN AT FIRST. MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WANT TIANA TO INFLUENCE SHANNON'S BEHAVIOR. I CAN'T HAVE ANY NEGATIVE INFLUENCES AROUND SHANNON RIGHT NOW. BUT SHANNON HAS A GOOD HEART. SHANNON SAID, "MOMMY, WE SHOULD HELP HER. YOU HELP YOUR FAMILY." AND SHANNON FELT IT WAS HER RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP. Narrator: TIANA SEEMS THRILLED, AS SHE AND SHANNON PLAN A MOVE-IN DATE ONE MONTH AWAY. BUT ALL IS NOT AS IT SEEMS. TIANA HARBORS SECRET RESENTMENT AND JEALOUSY TOWARDS SHANNON. Lopez: I THINK THAT TIANA WAS JEALOUS THAT SHANNON AND HER MOTHER WERE VERY CLOSE AND THAT SHANNON HAD A GOOD HEAD ON HER SHOULDERS. I THINK THAT TIANA PROBABLY DID FEEL LESS CAPABLE COMPARED TO SHANNON. Narrator: IN TIANA'S MIND, SHANNON HAS NEVER HAD TO SUFFER THE WAY SHE HAS. Doyle: SHANNON HADN'T BEEN TREATED CRUELLY. SHE WASN'T INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH THE KIND OF MENTAL STATE THAT TIANA WAS EXPERIENCING. Narrator: AS SHANNON BENDS OVER BACKWARDS TO HELP TIANA, SHE MISSES EVERY WARNING SIGN POINTED IN HER DIRECTION. SHANNON WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF HER KINDNESS. IT'S SEPTEMBER OF 2008. AND SHORTLY AFTER THE START OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, SHANNON CELEBRATES HER 16th BIRTHDAY. I REMEMBER HER MOTHER HAD BOUGHT HER A PAIR OF COACH SHOES, AN MP3, A CAMERA, AND I THINK SHE UPGRADED HER PHONE. AND SHANNON WAS REALLY HYPED ABOUT THAT. Narrator: AND SHANNON IS ALSO EXCITED THAT HER FRIEND TIANA IS GOING TO MOVE IN WITH HER IN JUST A FEW WEEKS. Lopez: SHE JUST KEPT SAYING, "OH, I'M SO HAPPY NOW. YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE I HAVE A SISTER NOW." Narrator: THE MOVE-IN DATE IS PLANNED FOR THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER. BUT TWO DAYS BEFORE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO MOVE IN, TIANA CALLS SHANNON UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. [ CELLPHONE RINGS ] SHANNON WAS SLEEPING, AND HER PHONE KEPT GOING OFF. TIANA WAS TEXTING HER AND TELLING HER THAT SHE NEEDS SOMEWHERE TO GO. Narrator: TIANA HAS RUN AWAY FROM HOME AGAIN AND IS OUT ON THE STREET. DESPERATE, SHE PLEADS WITH SHANNON TO LET HER COME OVER IMMEDIATELY. AND, OF COURSE, SHANNON SAYS YES. Paradis: SHANNON HAD A BIG HEART AND REALLY WANTED TO HELP. AND WHAT'S SAD IS THAT SHE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THAT HER COUSIN WAS MORE SERIOUSLY ILL THAN PEOPLE HAD THOUGHT. Narrator: DESPITE ALL OF SHANNON'S EFFORTS TO HELP, TIANA IS ABOUT TO TURN HER FRIEND'S LIFE INTO A NIGHTMARE. I THINK IF SHE HAD KNOWN, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL. SHE WAS CLEARLY, CLEARLY, SEVERELY EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED. THAT WAS ABOUT DESTRUCTION. THAT WAS ABOUT DESTRUCTION. Narrator: TIANA IS NOT SUPPOSED TO MOVE IN WITH HER COUSIN AND FRIEND SHANNON FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS. BUT WHEN SHE ENDS UP ON THE STREET, SHE CALLS SHANNON IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND WANTS TO MOVE IN RIGHT AWAY. TIANA CAME TO LIVE WITH SHANNON AND MARVA, AND SHANNON WANTED TO SHOW HER A DIFFERENT WAY TO LIVE. Narrator: SHANNON'S MOTHER TELLS TIANA IF SHE IS GOING TO LIVE WITH THEM, SHE WILL HAVE TO FOLLOW SOME BASIC RULES. Lopez: SHANNON'S HOUSE WAS VERY STRUCTURED. I DON'T WANT TO SAY STRICT, BUT HER MOTHER KEPT HER ON THE RIGHT PATH. Marva: WHILE YOU'RE HERE, YOU'RE GONNA ABIDE BY THE RULES OF THIS HOUSE. MARVA SAID THE NEXT DAY SHE GOT TIANA ALL READY FOR SCHOOL, AND SHE GAVE TIANA $5 FOR LUNCH BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING. AND SHE TOLD TIANA, "COME STRAIGHT HOME AFTER SCHOOL." Narrator: SHANNON AND HER MOTHER ARE THRILLED WHEN TIANA DOES EXACTLY AS SHE IS TOLD. Lopez: SO, MARVA WAS LIKE, "MAYBE THIS IS THE START TO SOMETHING GOOD, YOU KNOW? "SHE'S LISTENING TO ME, AND SHE'S DOING WHAT I SAY. SHE'S NOT DISRESPECTING MY WORD." Narrator: FOR TIANA, IT'S A CHANCE TO TURN OVER A NEW LEAF. BUT NOT EVEN SHE IS AWARE OF THE FORCE OF HER OWN JEALOUSY AND RESENTMENT AGAINST HER UNSUSPECTING FRIEND. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXACTLY WHAT TIANA NEEDED, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW HOW REALLY EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED SHE WAS. Narrator: ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, TIANA HAS BEEN AT SHANNON'S FOR LESS THAN TWO DAYS. IT'S A SCHOOL HOLIDAY, AND THE GIRLS JUST WANT TO STAY HOME AND HANG OUT WHILE MARVA RUNS SOME ERRANDS. MARVA WAS OUT, AND WHEN MARVA WAS COMING BACK HOME, HER AND SHANNON WERE SUPPOSED TO GO SHOPPING. Narrator: BUT THAT AFTERNOON, WHILE SHANNON'S MOTHER IS OUT, SOMETHING GOES TERRIBLY WRONG.SHANNON! NO ONE KNOWS WHY, BUT AN ARGUMENT ERUPTS BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS. MAYBE TIANA SAID SOMETHING TO SHANNON THAT SHANNON DIDN'T LIKE, AND SHANNON SPOKE UP AND WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK TO ME LIKE THAT." SHANNON DEFINITELY DID KNOW HOW TO STAND UP FOR HERSELF. Narrator: WHEN SHANNON LASHES BACK, ALL OF TIANA'S PENT-UP ANGER BOILS OVER, AND SOMETHING SNAPS IN HER. SUDDENLY, TIANA'S GOOD FRIEND SHANNON IS HER WORST ENEMY. I THINK THAT TIANA PROBABLY WAS JEALOUS OR WANTED EVERYTHING THAT SHANNON HAS. Paradis: AND IT MAY HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO WITH SHANNON. IT MAY HAVE BEEN THAT SHANNON REPRESENTED SOMETHING FOR TIANA THAT MADE HER VERY, VERY RAGEFUL. Narrator: BUT IN A FLASH, THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS. TIANA GRABS A KITCHEN KNIFE, AND THEN SHE COMES AFTER SHANNON. IT WAS COMPLETELY CRAZY. I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE THE SHOCK AND THE HORROR. Narrator: SHANNON IS NOW FACE-TO-FACE WITH TIANA'S RAGE. WHAT'S IN STORE FOR HER NEXT IS SHEER TERROR. Lopez: HER NEIGHBORS WERE SAYING THAT THEY HEARD SCREAMING. "HELP ME. HELP ME." IT'S CRAZY. I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. Lopez: SHE WAS SHOCKED. SHE JUST STARTED SCREAMING AND SCREAMING. WOULD MEET SUCH A CRUEL END AT THE HANDS OF SOMEONE THEY TRIED TO HELP. Narrator: SHANNON LOVED TIANA, AND IN THE END, SHE WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING FOR HER FRIEND AND COUSIN. HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK SHE -- I DON'T THINK SHANNON WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT SHANNON WOULD HAVE STILL TRIED TO HELP TIANA.
