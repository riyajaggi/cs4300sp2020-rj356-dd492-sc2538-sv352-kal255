CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS BRANDY STEVENS-ROSINE IS AN 18-YEAR-OLD FRESHMAN AT YOUNGSTOWN STATE UNIVERSITY.

AND SHE ALWAYS HAD THESE CRAZY DARK-RIMMED GLASSES. Narrator: FIERCELY INDEPENDENT, BRANDY IS KNOWN TO BE A LOYAL AND LOVING FRIEND. SHE WAS THE MODERN-DAY EQUIVALENT OF A SAINT. HER GOAL IN LIFE WAS TO HELP PEOPLE.

 Narrator: BRANDY IS ALSO OPENLY GAY AND HAS BEEN SINCE SHE WAS A YOUNG GIRL. SHE WANTED TO WORK WITH GAY RIGHTS. ANY KIND OF PROBLEM THAT SOCIETY HAS, SHE WANTED TO FIX IT. Narrator: ALWAYS EAGER TO MEET NEW FRIENDS, BRANDY OFTEN SURFS THE WEB TO FIND LIKE-MINDED PEOPLE. ONE DAY, SHE CONNECTS ONLINE WITH A 17-YEAR-OLD GIRL NAMED JADE OLMSTEAD. Hall: THEY WERE BOTH THE SAME AGE. THEY LISTENED TO THE SAME MUSIC. Narrator: BRANDY AND JADE SHARE STORIES ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES AND THE TROUBLE EACH GIRL IS HAVING DEALING WITH HER SEXUALITY. BRANDY HAD SOME ISSUES GROWING UP WITH HER PARENTS. Narrator: SO MUCH THAT BRANDY SPENDS MORE TIME AT HER GRANDPARENTS' PLACE NEARBY. BRANDY SAW HER GRANDMA'S HOUSE AS A SAFE PLACE TO STAY. Narrator: JADE ALSO HAS HER SHARE OF PROBLEMS. SHE IS SO UNCOMFORTABLE IN GROUP SETTINGS THAT SHE DROPS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL IN HER SENIOR YEAR AND IS HOMESCHOOLED. JADE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE RECLUSIVE AND MORE OF A WALLFLOWER. Narrator: BUT HOME PROVES TO BE NO SAFE HAVEN FOR THE TEEN. JADE WAS OPENLY GAY TO HER FRIENDS, BUT NOT TO HER FAMILY. Narrator: SHE'S SO AFRAID OF HER PARENTS' REACTION THAT SHE HASN'T EVEN ATTEMPTED TO TELL THEM ABOUT HER SEXUAL ORIENTATION. JADE AND BRANDY QUICKLY BOND, AND SOON, THEY DECIDE TO MEET IN PERSON. HEY, BRANDY? JADE? Nicks: THEY BECAME FAST FRIENDS AND THEY SEEMED TO BE VERY CLOSE. THEY SPENT TIME HANGING OUT TOGETHER, LISTENING TO MUSIC, AND PLAYING CARDS, AND DISCUSSING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIFFICULT HOME LIVES. MY NANA TAUGHT ME HOW TO PLAY CARDS. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TEACH ME. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, THE GIRLS' FRIENDSHIP GROWS AND TURNS ROMANTIC. BRANDY WAS CONSIDERED TO BE FUN AND WELL-ROUNDED. JADE WAS THE INTROVERT. SOMETIMES OPPOSITES ATTRACT. Narrator: AS THE GIRLS GET CLOSER, BRANDY TAKES ON A NURTURING ROLE. SHE HELPS JADE WITH HER HOMESCHOOLING AND PROVIDES COMFORT AS JADE DEALS WITH HER INCREASINGLY MISERABLE HOME LIFE. BRANDY WAS LIVING WITH HER GRANDPARENTS, AND, EVENTUALLY, JADE MOVED IN WITH BRANDY. HI. HEY. [ SMOOCHES ] HOW ARE YOU? Narrator: BUT THEIRS IS A POWERFUL YET COMPLICATED CONNECTION THAT WILL LEAD TO EVENTS THAT SHOCK EVEN THEIR CLOSEST FRIENDS. TWO MONTHS PASS AND IN EARLY 2011, BRANDY AND JADE'S RELATIONSHIP GETS ROCKY. I'M ON TOP OF YOU BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT YOU! THEY ARGUE ABOUT EVERYTHING, FROM WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND WHAT TO EAT TO FIGHTS ABOUT THEIR FRIENDS. ...LIKE TO ENJOY MYSELF, GOD FORBID. THEY HAD DEFINITELY HAD THEIR ROUGH PATCHES. LEAVE YOU ALONE?YOU NEED TO BACK OFF. FINE! THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. SIX MONTHS LATER, THEY BREAK UP AND DECIDE THEY WILL BE BETTER OFF AS FRIENDS. THE RELATIONSHIP CAN BE CHARACTERIZED AS PARTING AMICABLY. WE'RE STILL FRIENDS, RIGHT? Narrator: DESPITE THE HOT-AND-COLD FRIENDSHIP, THE GIRLS MANAGE TO SETTLE THEIR DISAGREEMENTS AND ENJOY SPENDING TIME TOGETHER. THEY DID SEEM TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER AND FORGIVE A LOT OF THINGS. Narrator: BUT SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BRANDY AND JADE GO TO THE LAUNDROMAT WITH FRIENDS. WHILE THERE, THEY GET INTO A PETTY ARGUMENT ABOUT THEIR PLAN FOR THE DAY. WE ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO OR I END UP GIVING UP. JUST TELL ME -- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? YOU KEEP DOING THIS. IT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE OVER ANYTHING REALLY SIGNIFICANT, JUST MAYBE THAT BRANDY WAS IRRITATED WITH JADE. Narrator: SO IRRITATED THAT BRANDY SNAPS. BRANDY TURNED ON JADE AND PUNCHED HER. Narrator: FURIOUS AND EMBARRASSED, JADE STORMS OUT OF THE LAUNDROMAT AND TELLS THEIR FRIENDS OUTSIDE WHAT JUST HAPPENED. I DON'T THINK THAT I COULD EVER SEE HER, LIKE, BEING ANGRY ENOUGH TO HIT SOMEBODY. JUST PUNCHED ME RIGHT IN THE FACE. Narrator: EVEN MORE STUNNING, JADE TELLS THEIR FRIENDS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME BRANDY'S HIT HER. ACCORDING TO JADE, BRANDY WOULD ASSAULT HER OR HIT HER QUITE OFTEN. Narrator: BUT THAT REVELATION IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. NOBODY COULD KEEP THEM FROM DOING WHAT THEY DID. IT WAS DEFINITELY PART OF THE MASTER PLAN. Narrator: BRANDY AND JADE, WHO ARE NOW JUST FRIENDS, STILL HANG OUT, BUT HAVE THEIR SHARE OF UPS AND DOWNS. THEY SEEM TO BE VERY CLOSE, BUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP ALSO SEEMED TO BE VERY VOLATILE AT TIMES. Narrator: WHEN JADE TELLS THEIR OTHER FRIENDS THAT BRANDY OFTEN HITS HER, THE ACCUSATIONS GET BACK TO BRANDY. Vaughn: BRANDY WAS HEARTBROKEN TO FIND OUT THAT HER FRIENDS TALKING BEHIND HER BACK AND SAYING THAT SHE BEATS HER BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HER PERSONALITY AT ALL. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?! Narrator: BRANDY IS SO OUTRAGED BY JADE'S CLAIMS THAT SHE DECIDES ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. SHE ENDS THE FRIENDSHIP.I'M DONE! I'M LEAVING! SHE REALLY WAS AT THE END OF HER ROPE. HEY. WHAT'S GOING ON? Narrator: BUT JUST TWO WEEKS LATER, JADE IS BACK AT BRANDY'S DOORSTEP. THINGS ARE ROUGH AT HOME, AND SHE NEEDS A PLACE TO STAY. BRANDY VALUES RELATIONSHIPS MORE THAN HOLDING A GRUDGE. "OKAY, WELL WE GOT IN A FIGHT. IT'S OVER NOW. LET'S MOVE ON." Narrator: BRANDY DECIDES TO HELP HER FRIEND AND SNEAKS JADE INTO THE BASEMENT OF HER GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE. BUT WHILE SHE'S THERE, $200 IN CASH, A VIDEO GAME, AND A CAMERA GO MISSING. BRANDY CONFRONTED JADE ABOUT THESE MISSING ITEMS. JADE DENIED EVERYTHING. MY BAG? IN YOUR BAG. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ENDED UP THERE. WELL, YOU PUT THEM THERE. HOW ELSE WOULD THEY GET THERE? BUT, AS FAR AS BRANDY WAS CONCERNED, JADE WAS THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WHO WAS THERE WHO COULD'VE TAKEN THEM. Narrator: ANGRY AND BETRAYED, BRANDY DECIDES TO FILE A POLICE REPORT AND KICKS JADE OUT. NO, SCREW IT. I'M CALLING THE COPS. THAT WAS HER WAY OF SAYING, "WE'RE DONE." I DON'T THINK THAT THERE WAS MUCH SAVING ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP AT THAT POINT. HELLO, POLICE? GOT AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY. Narrator: THE FORMER FRIENDS GO THEIR SEPARATE WAYS, BUT NOT FOR LONG. SOMEHOW, THE PAIR GETS PAST THE DRAMA AND STARTS SPENDING TIME TOGETHER AGAIN. Nicks: IT WAS LIKE A HUGE ROLLER COASTER RIDE -- A RELATIONSHIP THAT MANY PEOPLE SAW AS UNHEALTHY FROM THE BEGINNING. BRANDY STILL HAD A NEED TO WANT TO BE WITH JADE. Hall: JADE HAD STARTED TO BE NICER. MAYBE SHE WAS SICK OF THEM FIGHTING ALL THE TIME. Narrator: NOW WHEN THE GIRLS HANG OUT, THEIR TURBULENT RELATIONSHIP SEEMS TO BE A THING OF THE PAST. CHEERS! BUT THEIR FRIENDSHIP IS PUT TO THE TEST ONCE AGAIN A SHORT TIME LATER WHEN IN DECEMBER OF 2011, JADE TELLS BRANDY SHE NEEDS A CHANGE AND MOVES FIVE HOURS AWAY TO BALTIMORE. THERE'S NOT MUCH FOR ME HERE ANYMORE. I MEAN, WE BROKE UP. Vaughn: BRANDY WAS DEVASTATED. WHEN YOU'RE STARTING TO GET CLOSE TO SOMEBODY AGAIN AND YOU'RE DEVELOPING A HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIP, AND THEN, SURPRISE, YOU'RE MOVING SOME BAJILLION MILES AWAY. Narrator: IN BALTIMORE, JADE QUICKLY GETS A NEW GIRLFRIEND WHEN SHE RECONNECTS WITH AN OLD HIGH-SCHOOL FRIEND, 19-YEAR-OLD ASHLEY BARBER. BUT EVEN THOUGH JADE HAS MOVED AND IS IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP, SHE STILL KEEPS IN TOUCH WITH BRANDY. HI, JADE.AND IN APRIL 2012, JADE CALLS BRANDY AND TELLS HER SHE WANTS TO SEE HER. EVEN WITH ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS AND EVEN WITH ALL THE HURT THAT HAD HAPPENED BETWEEN THE TWO, JADE WANTED TO SPEND TIME WITH HER AGAIN. Narrator: SO BRANDY DRIVES TO BALTIMORE TO PICK JADE UP. HEY. HEY! AND IT SEEMS LIKE OLD TIMES. ON THE RIDE BACK, JADE TELLS BRANDY ALL ABOUT HER NEW GIRLFRIEND ASHLEY. ON THE OUTSIDE, BRANDY SEEMS HAPPY HER FRIEND HAS FOUND SOMEONE NEW, BUT INSIDE, SHE'S EXTREMELY JEALOUS. YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING... AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, LATER THAT DAY, AFTER SPENDING LESS THAN AN HOUR AT BRANDY'S HOME, JADE SUDDENLY SAYS SHE WANTS TO LEAVE TO GO VISIT HER NEW GIRLFRIEND AND ASKS BRANDY TO DRIVE HER THERE. BUT YOU CAME TO VISIT ME. LIKE, I DROVE FOUR HOURS. Vaughn: BRANDY WAS LIVID. BRANDY WOULD TAKE SO MUCH AND PUT UP WITH SO MUCH, BUT SHE DEFINITELY GOT TO THE POINT WHERE, "ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE USING ME." YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND? YEAH. Narrator: DESPITE FEELING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, BRANDY DRIVES JADE TO HER NEW GIRLFRIEND'S HOUSE ABOUT AN HOUR NORTH OF YOUNGSTOWN. THANKS FOR THE RIDE. SEE YOU. BYE. BUT SOON, JEALOUSY AND RESENTMENT WILL BOIL OVER AND UNLEASH AN UNIMAGINABLE EVIL THAT WILL SHATTER THEIR BOND FOREVER. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD'VE IMAGINED THIS GOING AS FAR AS IT DID. IT JUST SEEMS SO HORRIFIC. ASHLEY LIVES LIKE AN HOUR AWAY. Narrator: BRANDY IS UPSET THAT JADE HAS MOVED AWAY AND FOUND A NEW GIRLFRIEND. BUT YOU CAME TO VISIT ME. HER FEELINGS WERE REALLY HURT THAT JADE WAS MOVING ON AND SPENDING TIME WITH OTHER PEOPLE. Narrator: EVEN SO, THE GIRLS STAY IN TOUCH THROUGH TEXTS AND PHONE CALLS. BUT JADE'S NEW GIRLFRIEND ASHLEY IS NOT HAPPY THAT JADE IS STILL IN CONTACT WITH BRANDY. SHE WAS VERY ANGRY ABOUT THAT. WHAT DO YOU MEAN "JUST BRANDY"? WHAT? WE'RE STILL FRIENDS. ASHLEY WAS VERY JEALOUS, AND SHE DIDN'T WANT JADE TO BE FRIENDS WITH AN OLD GIRLFRIEND. WE'RE NOT ABOUT THIS. ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN, I WILL TELL HER. CALL HER UP.YOU CAN ASK HER. Narrator: ASHLEY BECOMES SO INSECURE THAT SHE BOLDLY CALLS BRANDY AND WARNS HER TO BACK OFF... GIVE ME THE PHONE. ASHLEY! ...AND STOP CONTACTING HER GIRLFRIEND. STOP CALLING MY GIRLFRIEND. SHE WAS AFRAID THAT SOMEONE WAS GONNA BE BETTER THAN HER AND JADE WAS GONNA DROP HER. YOU DON'T STOP, YOU DON'T LISTEN TO ME, YOU'LL BE SORRY. ASHLEY WAS VERY ARGUMENTATIVE AND MEAN. Narrator: ABOUT A MONTH LATER, JADE CALLS BRANDY APOLOGIZING FOR HER GIRLFRIEND'S BEHAVIOR. SHE TELLS BRANDY SHE'D LIKE FOR THE TWO GIRLS TO MEET SOON AND THINKS THEY'LL HIT IT OFF. SHE CARES FOR HER OLD FRIEND AND THINKS MAYBE THINGS WILL BE PLEASANT. Narrator: ON MAY 17, 2012, JADE INVITES BRANDY TO VISIT HER AND ASHLEY. JADE TEXTS A LOCATION FOR THEM TO MEET, AND, DESPITE THE TURBULENT HISTORY, BRANDY JUMPS AT THE CHANCE TO VISIT THEM. BRANDY DIDN'T STAY MAD AT ANYBODY FOR VERY LONG. I THINK BRANDY REALLY JUST WANTED TO BE FRIENDS WITH JADE, EVEN IF SHE COULDN'T BE MORE THAN FRIENDS WITH HER. Narrator: AS SHE HEADS OUT, SHE TEXTS ANOTHER FRIEND NAMED RHIANNON TO TELL HER ABOUT THE GET-TOGETHER. AND AT 11:00 A.M., BRANDY ARRIVES AT THE MEETING PLACE. IT WAS BASICALLY A LOCATION THAT WAS KIND OF OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. Narrator: WHEN SHE DOESN'T SEE HER FRIEND, BRANDY SENDS A SECOND TEXT TO RHIANNON. THAT MESSAGE INDICATED THAT SHE HAD A FUNNY FEELING ABOUT WHERE SHE WAS. Vaughn: YOU KNOW, "THIS DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT. THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT SPOT OR SHE GAVE ME THE WRONG ADDRESS." AND I REMEMBER BEING REALLY MAD THAT, "OH, WELL, IT WOULD FIGURE "THAT THIS GIRL'S PLAYED YOU SO MANY TIMES, "AND HERE'S A WRONG ADDRESS. DRIVE ALL THE WAY OUT HERE AND WASTE YOUR TIME." Narrator: A SHORT TIME LATER, RHIANNON GETS ONE MORE TEXT FROM BRANDY'S PHONE. IT'S A THIRD TEXT SAYING JADE NEVER SHOWED UP. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, FRIDAY, MAY 18th, BRANDY'S MOM DOESN'T HEAR FROM HER DAUGHTER. AND SINCE THEY TALK ON A REGULAR BASIS, SHE STARTS TO GET CONCERNED. AFTER ANOTHER DAY PASSES WITH STILL NO WORD FROM BRANDY, HER MOM IS WORRIED SICK. IT WAS THE SECOND DAY THAT SHE FINALLY THOUGHT, "OKAY, SOMETHING DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT." HER MOTHER STARTED CONTACTING HER CLOSEST FRIENDS, TRYING TO FIND OUT IF ANYONE HAD HEARD FROM BRANDY. Narrator: WHEN BRANDY'S MOM CALLS RHIANNON, SHE LEARNS ABOUT THE STRANGE TEXTS BRANDY SENT. RHIANNON: She said that she had, like, a strange feeling. BRANDY'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND, AND HER FAMILY'S CONCERNED. Narrator: BRANDY'S MOM IMMEDIATELY REPORTS HER DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE TO THE POLICE. THEN HER MOTHER, GRANDMOTHER, AND TWO OF BRANDY'S FRIENDS DRIVE ABOUT AN HOUR NORTH OF YOUNGSTOWN TO THE AREA WHERE BRANDY WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET JADE AND ASHLEY. THE SEARCH PARTY KNOCKS ON DOORS. THEY ARE SURPRISED WHEN, AT ONE OF THE HOMES, THEY FIND JADE AND HER GIRLFRIEND ASHLEY. JADE AND ASHLEY DENY KNOWING ANYTHING. THEY INDICATE THAT THEY HAD NOT SEEN BRANDY. I HAVEN'T REALLY TALKED TO HER MUCH LATELY. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HER. Narrator: BRANDY'S MOM AND FRIENDS ARE SUSPICIOUS AND URGE POLICE TO QUESTION THE GIRLS. Nicks: WHY WAS SHE OUT IN THAT AREA IF SHE WASN'T OUT THERE TO SEE JADE? Narrator: POLICE QUESTION THEM, BUT DON'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE OF FOUL PLAY. PLEASE KEEP US INFORMED. SURE. AFTER THREE DAYS AND STILL NO SIGN OF BRANDY, EVERYONE STARTS TO FEAR THE WORST. BUT NOTHING COULD EVER PREPARE THEM FOR WHAT THEY LEARN WHEN THE SHOCKING TRUTH IS REVEALED. I'M STARTING TO FREAK OUT, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. WE WOKE THEM UP CRYING, SCREAMING. IT WAS DEVASTATING. Narrator: 20-YEAR-OLD BRANDY STEVENS-ROSINE HAS BEEN MISSING FOR THREE DAYS. [ KNOCK ON DOOR ] POLICE QUESTION JADE AND HER GIRLFRIEND ASHLEY ABOUT BRANDY'S DISAPPEARANCE. THE GIRLS CLAIM THEY HAVEN'T SEEN HER. JADE JUST BLEW IT OFF LIKE, "OH, YEAH, SHE DIDN'T MAKE IT HERE." Narrator: FRUSTRATED, POLICE STEP UP THEIR INVESTIGATION, AND SOON, THEY GET A BIG LEAD. Nicks: THEY ACTUALLY LOCATED BRANDY'S VEHICLE IN THE GARAGE WHERE JADE AND ASHLEY WERE RESIDING AT THE TIME. Narrator: INVESTIGATORS FIND MORE EVIDENCE WHEN THEY START CHECKING AT LOCAL HOSPITALS. THEY FOUND MEDICAL RECORDS SHOWING THAT ASHLEY HAD ACTUALLY BEEN TREATED FOR AN INJURY ON THE VERY DAY BRANDY DISAPPEARED. THAT GAVE THE INVESTIGATORS ENOUGH OF A CONNECTION TO GO BACK AND TALK TO JADE AND ASHLEY A SECOND TIME. HI. REMEMBER DETECTIVE LIONEL?YEAH. HOW CAN I HELP YOU? WE GOT SOME MORE INFORMATION THAT BRANDY MAY HAVE BEEN AROUND. Narrator: BUT THIS TIME, THE GIRLS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY. SHE STOPPED BY HERE... AT THIS POINT, THEY SAID THAT BRANDY HAD BEEN OVER FOR A LITTLE BIT, BUT SHE DIDN'T STAY LONG. IT WAS ONLY ABOUT FOR FIVE MINUTES. IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, "OH, WELL, SHE JUST LEFT." Narrator: JADE AND ASHLEY ARE NOW PRIME SUSPECTS... THANK YOU VERY MUCH....BUT POLICE NEED PROOF. THAT PROOF FINALLY COMES ON MAY 23, 2012, WHEN, SIX DAYS AFTER BRANDY'S DISAPPEARANCE, AUTHORITIES MAKE A GRUESOME DISCOVERY IN THE WOODS BEHIND JADE AND ASHLEY'S HOUSE. THEY FIND THIS SHALLOW GRAVE, AND THEY BEGIN DIGGING. Cartwright-Jones: AND IN THAT SHALLOW GRAVE WAS BRANDY'S PARTIALLY DECOMPOSED BODY. THIS IS SERGEANT SMITH. Narrator: POLICE IMMEDIATELY ARREST JADE AND ASHLEY. DURING A SIX-HOUR INTERROGATION, THE GIRLS EVENTUALLY CONFESS THAT THEY CAME UP WITH AN EVIL AND SHOCKING PLAN TO KILL JADE'S EX-GIRLFRIEND BRANDY. THE GIRLS TELL POLICE JADE BROUGHT BRANDY BACK TO THEIR HOUSE. THEN, JADE AND ASHLEY SHOWED HER AROUND THE PROPERTY. BUT BRANDY HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S IN STORE FOR HER. [ GRUNTING ] JADE AND ASHLEY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY ATTACK BRANDY. Nicks: THIS WAS PART OF THEIR MASTER PLAN TO LURE BRANDY TO THIS LOCATION WHERE NO ONE COULD SEE HER, NO ONE COULD HEAR THE SCREAMS. SHE WAS CHOKED. SHE WAS RESTRAINED WITH A ROPE. Narrator: THEY ALSO BEAT HER WITH A SHOVEL. DURING THE STRUGGLE, ASHLEY IS INJURED. THAT WAS BRANDY FIGHTING BACK. SHE FOUGHT THE WHOLE TIME. SHE WANTED TO LIVE, AND SHE WAS BEGGING FOR HER LIFE AND ASKED THEM TO LET HER GO. [ GRUNTS ] PLEASE! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! [ GRUNTS ] Narrator: BUT THE GIRLS IGNORE BRANDY'S DESPERATE PLEAS. [ CLANGING ] SAVAGELY BEATEN AND CLINGING TO LIFE, BRANDY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS. Nicks: AND THEN THEY DUMP HER INTO THIS SHALLOW GRAVE. SHE'S STILL ALIVE. THEY TOOK A HUGE ROCK, DROPPED IT ON HER HEAD, AND THEN THEY ALSO TOOK A BOTTLE OF WATER AND TRIED TO POUR WATER DOWN HER THROAT AND MOUTH TO BASICALLY DROWN HER. IN THAT SHALLOW GRAVE, SHE SUFFOCATED. IN EFFECT, SHE WAS BURIED ALIVE. Narrator: AFTER LEAVING BRANDY FOR DEAD, JADE AND ASHLEY USE HER CELLPHONE TO COMPLETE THEIR TWISTED PLAN. THEY SEND A TEXT MESSAGE TO HER FRIENDS TO KEEP EVERYBODY OFF THE TRAIL. THAT TEXT MESSAGE READ, "JADE NEVER SHOWED UP." Nicks: THIS WAS JUST ALL A PLAN TO THROW THE FAMILY OFF SO THAT THEY WOULD GO LOOKING FOR BRANDY ELSEWHERE. Narrator: POLICE CONCLUDE THAT THE VICIOUS MURDER IS THE RESULT OF ASHLEY'S RESENTMENT TOWARD JADE'S OLD GIRLFRIEND. ASHLEY DIDN'T LIKE BRANDY BEING AROUND JADE. IT'S SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM PURE JEALOUSY TO THE Nth DEGREE. Narrator: AFTER THE GRUESOME CONFESSION, BOTH ARE CHARGED WITH MURDER AND CONSPIRACY. POLICE BREAK THE HORRIFYING NEWS TO BRANDY'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS. Vaughn: WE CRIED AND CRIED AND CRIED AND CRIED. I THINK THAT IT'S MALICIOUS. THEY'D ALREADY HAD IT ALL PLANNED OUT. Narrator: IN THE FALL OF 2013, BOTH JADE OLMSTEAD AND ASHLEY BARBER PLEAD GUILTY TO FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND ARE SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. LOVED ONES CAN'T BEGIN TO FATHOM HOW BRANDY'S FRIEND -- SOMEONE SHE TRUSTED AND LOVED -- WOULD TAKE HER LIFE. JADE AND BRANDY IS THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE THAT ANY PERSON COULD HAVE IT IN THEM TO BETRAY BRANDY. IT IS EVIL. IT'S DEFINITELY EVIL. THIS IS THE WORST THAT A PERSON COULD BE. IT'S JUST THE LOWEST OF LOW.
