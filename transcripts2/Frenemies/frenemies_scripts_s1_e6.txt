 Nikki: JEN AND I WERE LIKE OPPOSITES. WE JUST HIT IT OFF AS FRIENDS. Narrator: BEFORE LONG, THEY BECOME BEST FRIENDS. JENNIFER ADMIRES NIKKI'S DOWN-TO-EARTH AND PRACTICAL NATURE. AND SHE QUICKLY COMES TO RELY ON HER FOR GUIDANCE AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. JEN LIKED TO ASK ME FOR ADVICE. SHE ALWAYS THOUGHT OF ME AS HER GOOD CONSCIENCE. Narrator: NIKKI IS ESPECIALLY HELPFUL WHEN IT COMES TO JENNIFER'S SON, MATTHEW. Nikki: SHE'S RAISING HER SON BY HERSELF. JEN STRUGGLED EMOTIONALLY, BEING A SINGLE PARENT. Narrator: NIKKI AND JENNIFER THINK THEY WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER, THROUGH THICK AND THIN. WE TOLD EACH OTHER THAT WE LOVED EACH OTHER. Narrator: BUT LITTLE DO EITHER OF THEM KNOW, THEIR RELATIONSHIP IS HEADED FOR A DANGEROUS CONFRONTATION. AND WHEN IT DOES COME, IT'S EXPLOSIVE. AFTER NEARLY 10 YEARS OF FRIENDSHIP, JENNIFER AND NIKKI ARE STILL CLOSE. BUT THEIR LIVES HAVE STARTED TO MOVE IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. NIKKI IS NOW A DEVOTED WIFE TO HER HUSBAND, JIM, AND A LOVING MOTHER TO A FIVE-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER NAMED KATELYN. SHE HAS A JOB AS AN ACCOUNTANT, AND A STABLE HOME LIFE. Nikki: MY PRIORITIES CHANGED. I FELT LIKE I HAD TO BE A MORE RESPONSIBLE PERSON. Narrator: NIKKI'S LONGTIME BEST FRIEND JENNIFER IS WORKING AT A LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, BUT HER WILD LIFESTYLE COULDN'T BE MORE DIFFERENT THAN NIKKI'S. Nikki: JEN WAS PRETTY CRAZY. SHE WAS DRINKING A LOT, BRAGGING ABOUT HER DRINKING AND HOW MANY BOTTLES OF WINE SHE'D HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE. Narrator: ALONG WITH JENNIFER'S DRINKING COMES A CONSTANT STREAM OF BOYFRIENDS. SHE WAS LOOKING FOR LOVE. I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE, BUT I DON'T THINK SHE, PROBABLY, WAS GOING ABOUT IT THE SMARTEST WAY. Narrator: NIKKI IS DISTURBED BY HER BEST FRIEND'S RECKLESS BEHAVIOR. WHAT SHE ONCE SAW AS OUTGOING AND FUN-LOVING NOW SEEMS IRRESPONSIBLE AND IMMATURE. AND SHE IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT JENNIFER'S UNSAVORY LIFESTYLE MIGHT HAVE ON HER SON MATTHEW, WHO IS NOW 9-YEARS-OLD. Nikki: I THINK HER SON WAS DEFINITELY AFFECTED BY ALL THE MEN COMING IN AND OUT OF HER LIFE. THERE ONE DAY AND GONE THE NEXT. Narrator: NIKKI TRIES TO HELP AS SHE WATCHES JENNIFER'S LIFE MOVE DANGEROUSLY CLOSER TO THE EDGE. I KIND OF WANTED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH YOU. Nikki: I ALWAYS TOLD HER HOW I FELT. I FELT THAT SHE NEEDED TO DRINK LESS. I FELT THAT SHE NEEDED TO FIND ONE PERSON. I THINK IT'S TIME YOU SLOW DOWN. STOP HAVING MEN COMING IN AND OUT OF HER LIFE. Narrator: BUT OVER TIME, JENNIFER STARTS TO THINK NIKKI IS JUST BEING BOSSY. I DO SPEND PLENTY OF TIME WITH MY SON! AND WHEN NIKKI REALIZES THAT HER HEARTFELT ADVICE IS FALLING ON DEAF EARS, SHE QUICKLY GROWS IRRITATED. Nikki: IT JUST PUSHED ME AWAY, JUST MADE ME NOT WANT TO BE AROUND HER. Holdefer: WITH JEN, IT WAS JUST NONSTOP DRAMA. THERE WAS JUST A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND CRAZINESS SURROUNDING HER. NIKKI WANTED TO GET AWAY FROM THAT KIND OF THING. Narrator: JENNIFER'S ERRATIC BEHAVIOR BEGINS TO DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS. JEN AND I STARTED GROWING APART. STILL FRIENDS, BUT NOT HANGING OUT ALL THE TIME. I FELT THE DISTANCE GROWING BETWEEN US. Narrator: AND WITHOUT NIKKI THERE FOR CONSTANT SUPPORT, JENNIFER BECOMES INCREASINGLY UNHINGED. JEN DID HAVE MOOD SWINGS. THERE WERE TIMES WHERE SHE'D BE REALLY DOWN. Narrator: BUT NIKKI COULD NEVER IMAGINE WHAT'S GOING THROUGH HER FRIEND'S MIND. ONE DAY, IN THE FALL OF 2011, JENNIFER GOES TO AN EXTREME. SHE HAS A HYSTERICAL BREAKDOWN AT WORK AND SUDDENLY DRIVES OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. AND WHEN JEN GOT HOME, SHE PULLED HER CAR IN THE GARAGE. Narrator: JENNIFER CLOSES THE GARAGE DOOR, BUT SHE DOESN'T GET OUT OF HER CAR. SHE LEFT HER CAR RUNNING AND LOCKED HERSELF IN. Narrator: JENNIFER TRIES TO TAKE HER OWN LIFE -- THE ULTIMATE ACT OF DESPERATION. BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HER, A CONCERNED COWORKER HAS FOLLOWED HER HOME. WHEN JENNIFER DOESN'T LEAVE THE GARAGE, SHE FEARS THE WORST AND CALLS 9-1-1. POLICE RACE TO JENNIFER'S HOUSE AND PULL HER FROM HER CAR IN THE NICK OF TIME. Nikki: JEN WAS VERY LUCKY. I FELT BAD FOR HER. NIKKI WAS MORE AND MORE WORRIED ABOUT HER MENTAL STATE. Narrator: NIKKI IS RELIEVED THAT JENNIFER IS UNHARMED. BUT NEITHER OF THEM REALIZE THAT JENNIFER'S ATTEMPTED SUICIDE IS ONLY THE START OF A TERRIFYING CHAIN OF EVENTS. IT TURNED INTO A GAME OF CAT-AND-MOUSE BETWEEN JEN AND NIKKI. Nikki: I WAS SCARED. IT WOULDN'T COME INTO MY MIND THAT ANYONE WOULD ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S SCARY. VERY, VERY SCARY. I WAS STARTING TO FEEL THREATENED. Narrator: DESPITE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN JENNIFER AND NIKKI IN RECENT MONTHS, NIKKI IS HORRIFIED, BUT RELIEVED WHEN HER BEST FRIEND OF NEARLY 10 YEARS SURVIVES A SUICIDE ATTEMPT. JENNIFER IS ADMITTED INTO A MENTAL HOSPITAL IN DES MOINES. Nikki: I WAS NOT SURPRISED, WITH HER ERRATIC BEHAVIOR AND HER DRINKING, I JUST FELT LIKE IT WAS PROBABLY ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. Narrator: FROM HER HOSPITAL BED, JENNIFER REACHES OUT TO NIKKI -- THE ONE PERSON WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR HER IN THE PAST. BUT THIS TIME, JENNIFER MAKES A SURPRISING REQUEST. Holdefer: JEN REACHED OUT TO NIKKI TO ASK HER TO PLAN A 30th BIRTHDAY PARTY. Narrator: JENNIFER CAN'T ACCESS FACEBOOK FROM THE HOSPITAL, SO SHE ASKS NIKKI TO SEND OUT THE INVITATIONS ON HER BEHALF. JEN WANTED A LOT OF BOOZE AND FUN AND CRAZINESS. Narrator: NIKKI IS UPSET THAT JENNIFER IS MORE FOCUSED ON A PARTY THAN HER RECOVERY. NIKKI FELT CONFLICTED BECAUSE JEN'S GOT MORE PROBLEMS THAN A MATH BOOK, AND HER 30th BIRTHDAY PARTY SHOULD BE THE LEAST OF HER WORRIES. Narrator: BUT AGAINST HER BETTER JUDGEMENT, NIKKI AGREES TO HELP. I AGREED TO DO THIS JUST BECAUSE I FELT SORRY FOR HER. Narrator: LITTLE DOES NIKKI KNOW THAT HER ACTIONS WILL SET OFF A FRIGHTENING SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE PREDICTED. BY THE TIME JENNIFER IS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL, NIKKI HAS RELUCTANTLY SENT OUT THE PARTY INVITATIONS. I PROBABLY INVITED, MAYBE, 20 TO 30 PEOPLE. Narrator: THE BIRTHDAY BASH IS SCHEDULED FOR THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY. JENNIFER IS RIGHT BACK TO HER PARTYING WAYS. AND FOR HER, THE BIG NIGHT CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH, BUT HER EXCITEMENT IS SHORT LIVED. WHEN JENNIFER CHECKS FACEBOOK, SHE IS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE COMING TO HER PARTY. A LOT OF PEOPLE WEREN'T GOING TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND. THERE'S, LIKE, NO ONE COMING. JEN SAID THE PARTY WASN'T GOING TO BE ANY FUN -- NOBODY WAS COMING. JEN FELT THAT IT WAS NIKKI'S FAULT FOR THE POOR TURNOUT. Narrator: BUT NIKKI FEELS SHE HAS BENT OVER BACKWARDS FOR HER FRIEND. I THINK NIKKI GOT UPSET. AND SHE THOUGHT, "HEY, I MEAN, I'M DOING THESE THINGS FOR YOU. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DO IT YOURSELF." Nikki: I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS TRYING TO PIN THIS ON ME. Narrator: THEN JENNIFER SAYS IF NO ONE'S COMING, SHE'LL GO OUT AND FIND HER OWN PARTY. ON TOP OF THAT, SHE SHARES A DISTURBING PLAN WITH NIKKI. JEN TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD PUT MATTHEW TO BED, AND THEN SHE WOULD BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO THE BARS. I'LL GET TRASHED BY MYSELF. I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT. I'M A MOTHER, AND I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THAT LEAVING YOUR 9-YEAR-OLD SON HOME ALONE WHILE YOU'RE OUT AT THE BAR IS APPROPRIATE. I CALLED HER OUT ON IT. I TOLD HER, "JEN, YOU CAN'T DO THAT." Narrator: JENNIFER IS SICK OF NIKKI TELLING HER HOW TO LIVE HER LIFE. Nikki: JENNIFER WAS MAD. SHE MADE SOME COMMENT ABOUT ME SOUNDING JUST LIKE HER MOTHER, AND THAT'S WHEN I SAID, "JEN, I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE COMING TO YOUR PARTY." Narrator: NIKKI ANGRILY HANGS UP ON HER FRIEND. BUT IT'S FAR FROM OVER FOR JENNIFER. WHEN NIKKI REFUSES TO COME TO HER PARTY, JENNIFER FEELS LIKE IT'S A STAB IN THE BACK. WHEN NIKKI SAID SHE WASN'T COMING TO THE BIRTHDAY PARTY, JEN JUST COMPLETELY LOST IT. Narrator: SUDDENLY, ALL OF JENNIFER AND NIKKI'S FRUSTRATIONS COME TO A HEAD. THAT WAS THE TIPPING POINT IN THE FRIENDSHIP. Narrator: JENNIFER IS INFURIATED AND SHE LASHES OUT AT NIKKI IN A SHOCKING WAY -- ON THE INTERNET FOR EVERYONE TO SEE. LATER THAT DAY, WHEN NIKKI LOGS ON TO FACEBOOK, SHE SEES A POST FROM JENNIFER THAT CATCHES HER COMPLETELY OFF-GUARD. JEN HAD POSTED A COMMENT SAYING, "ISN'T IT [BLEEP] UP "THAT THE PERSON WHO'S THROWING YOU YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY DECIDES THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SHOW UP." Narrator: NIKKI IS HORRIFIED WHEN SHE REALIZES THAT JENNIFER IS TALKING ABOUT HER. BUT ALL SHE CAN DO IS WATCH HELPLESSLY AS OTHERS START ACCUSING HER OF LETTING HER FRIEND DOWN. IT HURT ME, BECAUSE I FELT LIKE PEOPLE ARE BELIEVING WHAT SHE'S SAYING. THEY'RE TAKING JEN'S SIDE. Narrator: A FURIOUS NIKKI IS QUICK TO RETALIATE, FIRING OFF AN ANGRY POST OF HER OWN ON JENNIFER'S WALL. I WAS VERY UPSET, AND I DID POST SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF, "WHAT'S MORE [BLEEP] UP? "ME NOT COMING TO THE PARTY, "OR HER LEAVING HER 9-YEAR-OLD SON HOME ALONE WHILE SHE'S OUT DRINKING?" Narrator: NIKKI HITS A RAW NERVE. NOW BOTH FRIENDS ARE SEETHING WITH RAGE, AND EVENTS ARE ABOUT TO TAKE AN ALARMING AND DANGEROUS TURN. THEY WERE TERRIFIED. Nikki: I WAS SHOCKED. I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE WOULD EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO ME -- EVER. Narrator: BEST FRIENDS NIKKI AND JENNIFER ARE LOCKED IN A BITTER FEUD ON FACEBOOK, AND THEIR ONLINE BATTLE IS ABOUT TO EXPLODE INTO AN ALL-OUT WAR. JENNIFER BELIEVES THAT NIKKI DELIBERATELY RUINED HER BIRTHDAY PARTY AND PUBLICLY HUMILIATED HER. NOW IT'S PAYBACK TIME. JEN'S MELTDOWN WAS NOTHING SHORT OF NUCLEAR. Narrator: JENNIFER'S TARGET? NIKKI'S MARRIAGE. SHE WAS SAYING THAT I WAS USING A FAKE FACEBOOK ACCOUNT TO MEET MEN. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S A BIG ACCUSATION, THAT A MARRIED WOMAN WOULD TRY TO MEET OTHER MEN. SHE WAS TRYING TO GET MY HUSBAND MAD AT ME. Narrator: FORTUNATELY, JIM DOESN'T BELIEVE JENNIFER. I WROTE OFF THOSE MESSAGES AS NONSENSE. Narrator: BUT HE IS FURIOUS THAT JENNIFER'S ATTACKS ON NIKKI WILL STOP AT NOTHING. THAT WAS PRETTY TRAUMATIC. I FELT ANGRY. Narrator: AND FOR NIKKI, THIS IS THE LAST STRAW. THAT, PRETTY MUCH, WAS THE LINE IN THE SAND FOR ME, AND SHE CROSSED IT. AT THAT POINT, THAT'S WHEN I BLOCKED AND UNFRIENDED JEN. BY UNFRIENDING JEN ON FACEBOOK, I THINK NIKKI SENT JEN A PRETTY CLEAR MESSAGE -- "LEAVE ME ALONE. I'M DONE WITH YOU. I DON'T WANT TO KNOW YOU ANYMORE." Narrator: JUST LIKE THAT, AFTER NEARLY 10 YEARS OF CLOSE FRIENDSHIP, NIKKI DOESN'T JUST UNFRIEND JENNIFER, SHE CUTS HER OUT OF HER LIFE. Holdefer: JEN WAS FURIOUS. VERY, VERY, VERY ANGRY. Narrator: IN JENNIFER'S MIND, NIKKI HAS JUST COMMITTED THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. AT THAT MOMENT, JENNIFER VOWS REVENGE AT ANY COST. Nikki: I RECEIVED A TEXT FROM JEN SAYING, "YOU WANT TO START [BLEEP] GAME ON." Narrator: THOUGH NIKKI IS SHAKEN, SHE TRIES TO PUT THE DISTURBING MESSAGE OUT OF HER MIND. BUT THE MESSAGES CONTINUE, AND THEY GROW MORE VICIOUS. Holdefer: THERE WERE INCREASING TEXT MESSAGES DURING THE DAY. JEN STARTED WRITING VERY THREATENING THINGS. I DIDN'T RESPOND BACK TO HER. I DIDN'T TEXT HER. I DIDN'T CALL HER. I DIDN'T TRY TO COME INTO CONTACT WITH HER AT ALL. Narrator: WHEN NIKKI IGNORES JENNIFER'S MESSAGES, IT ONLY EGGS HER ON. SHE WAS SAYING THAT SHE WAS GOING TO COME AND BEAT ME UP. SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT PUNCHING HER FACE IN, AND "I CAN'T WANT TO SEE THE LOOK ON HER FACE." THEY WERE GETTING CRAZIER AND CRAZIER. Narrator: NIKKI IS PARALYZED WITH FEAR. HER EX-BEST-FRIEND, WHO SHE USED TO SHARE EVERYTHING WITH, IS HELL-BENT ON GETTING BACK AT HER. I WAS WORRIED ABOUT NIKKI. SHE WAS CRYING. SHE WAS VERY UPSET. Narrator: THEN, ON OCTOBER 26th, JENNIFER SENDS YET ANOTHER MESSAGE. AND THIS ONE IS THE MOST CHILLING OF THEM ALL. SHE SAID I WASN'T GOING TO HAVE LEGS TO STAND ON OR A HOUSE TO LIVE IN. IT SCARED ME. I WAS VERY WORRIED THAT SHE MIGHT ACT UPON HER THREATS, BUT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING I COULD DO. Narrator: NOW IT'S CLEAR THAT JENNIFER IS OUT FOR REVENGE, AND NOTHING CAN STOP HER. AND WHAT SHE HAS PLANNED FOR NIKKI NEXT IS SHEER TERROR. I WAS SCARED. IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS. MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS TO CALL 9-1-1. Narrator: NIKKI AND JENNIFER'S DECADE-LONG FRIENDSHIP HAS IMPLODED. AND UNBEKNOWNST TO NIKKI, JENNIFER IS PUSHING HER REVENGE TO THE EXTREME. Nikki: I WENT OUT RIGHT BEFORE BED AND SHUT THE GARAGE DOOR, WENT INSIDE, WENT TO BED. Narrator: IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ON THURSDAY, OCTOBER 27, 2011, AND NIKKI AND HER FAMILY ARE FAST ASLEEP. I WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY THAT NIGHT, BUT I WOKE UP TO A LOUD POPPING NOISE. Narrator: ALARMED, NIKKI GETS UP, GOES TO THE WINDOW, AND IS STRUCK WITH TERROR AND DISBELIEF AT WHAT SHE SEES. I LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW -- SAW FIRE. Narrator: PANIC STRICKEN, SHE IMMEDIATELY WAKES JIM. I COULDN'T EVEN SEE MY GARAGE. IT WAS JUST BARRELS OF SMOKE AND FIRE COMING OUT OF IT. Narrator: TO THEIR HORROR, THE ENTIRE GARAGE IS ENGULFED IN FLAMES, AND THE RAGING FIRE IS NOW SPREADING RAPIDLY TO THE HOUSE. Nikki: WHEN I SAW THE FIRE, I GRABBED THE PHONE, CALLED 9-1-1. I RAN TO THE BEDROOM. I WOKE KATELYN UP. Jim: NIKKI YANKED HER OUT OF BED. I WAS SCARED. I JUST WANTED TO GET KATELYN AND GET NIKKI AND GET THEM OUT. THERE WAS SO MUCH ADRENALINE, I DON'T REALLY -- I JUST ACTED. Narrator: THE ONLY WAY OUT OF THE HOUSE IS STRAIGHT TOWARDS THE ROARING FLAMES. THE HEAT WAS SO BAD, YOU COULD JUST FEEL IT RIGHT WHEN YOU OPEN THE DOOR. THEY HAD TO RUN RIGHT THROUGH THE FIRE. THEY WERE TERRIFIED. [ SIRENS WAILING ] Narrator: MIRACULOUSLY, NIKKI AND HER FAMILY MAKE IT OUT ALIVE JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME. Nikki: WE GOT OUT TO THE STREET AND IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS. THERE WAS, I THINK, FIVE FIRE TRUCKS ON THE STREET IN FRONT OF ME. I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE DIDN'T WAKE UP. I FEEL VERY LUCKY THAT WE GOT OUT ALIVE AND UNHURT. Narrator: FINALLY, THE FIREFIGHTERS MANAGE TO PUT OUT THE BLAZE AND REVEAL THE TERRIBLE DESTRUCTION. Jim: WE LOST EVERYTHING IN THE GARAGE, INCLUDING MY CAR, NIKKI'S CAR, KATELYN'S BIKE. IT COOKED. IT COOKED EVERYTHING IN THERE. GONE -- ALL OF IT. Narrator: THE FLAMES CAUSED SEVERE DESTRUCTION TO THEIR HOME. Nikki: I DON'T THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONG BEFORE THE HOUSE CAUGHT ON FIRE. THE WHOLE BACK SIDE OF MY HOUSE AND THE WHOLE SIDE OF MY HOUSE WERE COMPLETELY MELTED OFF. TWO WINDOWS WERE BROKE FROM THE HEAT. Narrator: FOUR NEIGHBORING HOMES ALSO SUSTAINED DAMAGE. THEN, AS THE SMOKE CLEARS, REALITY SINKS IN. I WAS LOOKING AT THE SMOLDERING RUBBLE OF MY GARAGE. IT TOOK ME ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO REALIZE IT WAS JEN. SHE KNEW IT WAS JEN, I KNEW IT WAS JEN. Nikki: I KNEW RIGHT AWAY IT WAS NOT AN ACCIDENT. WHEN THE POLICE CAME, I TOLD THEM THE WHOLE STORY. THEY DID ASK IF THERE WAS ANYBODY THAT MEANS TO HURT US, AND WE JUST DIDN'T HESITATE A MOMENT -- "JENNIFER HARRIS." Narrator: AFTER NIKKI SHARES JENNIFER'S TEXT MESSAGES AND FACEBOOK POSTS WITH POLICE, THEY TRACK HER DOWN AND BRING HER IN FOR QUESTIONING. UNDER INTENSE CROSS-EXAMINATION, SHE CONFESSES TO SETTING THE FIRE. Nikki: THE GARAGE WAS UNLOCKED AND JEN ENTERED THE GARAGE WITH A ROLL OF TOILET PAPER, OPENED THE BACK DOOR TO MY CAR AND THREW THE LIT ROLL OF TOILET PAPER ONTO THE SEAT. AND THEN SHE LEFT. Holdefer: JENNIFER FELT THAT NIKKI HAD BETRAYED HER AS A FRIEND. SHE WANTED TO BURN HER LIFE DOWN, AND THAT'S WHAT SHE TRIED TO DO. I WAS SHOCKED. I COULD NEVER IMAGINE ANYONE WOULD EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT TO ME -- EVER. Narrator: NIKKI AND JENNIFER WERE BEST FRIENDS FOR NEARLY 10 YEARS, UNTIL A BITTER FEUD PROVOKES AN ACT OF LIFE-THREATENING VIOLENCE. I DON'T THINK NIKKI WOULD HAVE GUESSED THAT HER BEST FRIEND WOULD BURN HER GARAGE DOWN. Narrator: NIKKI AND HER FAMILY ARE STILL AT A LOSS TO EXPLAIN WHY SOMEONE THEY THOUGHT WAS HER BEST FRIEND WOULD WANT TO DESTROY HER. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I STILL DON'T TO THIS DAY. Narrator: JENNIFER PLEADS GUILTY TO SECOND DEGREE ARSON. ON MAY 10, 2012 SHE RECEIVES A 10 YEAR SUSPENDED SENTENCE AND IS ORDERED TO UNDERGO PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY. I NEVER THOUGHT MY BEST FRIEND WOULD BECOME MY ENEMY. I DIDN'T THINK THAT ANYONE'S BEST FRIEND COULD EVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.
