 Narrator: TWO MISFITS BECOME BEST FRIENDS... THEY WERE CONSTANTLY TOGETHER. Narrator: ...UNTIL JEALOUSY SPARKS A COLD-BLOODED PLOT FOR REVENGE.

 AND TRUSTING YOUNG WOMAN. SHE JUST WAS VERY HAPPY-GO-LUCKY. SHE THOUGHT NOTHING OF WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND DANCING WHILE SHE WAS DOING IT. SHE WANTED EVERYBODY TO PAY ATTENTION TO HER, TO BE HER FRIEND. Narrator: BUT JENNIFER IS DIFFERENT THAN OTHERS HER AGE. ALTHOUGH SHE IS 28 YEARS OLD, SHE STILL LIVES AT HOME AND HAS AN IQ OF 71. SHE WAS 28 IN BODY, BUT NOT IN MIND. I WOULD PROBABLY PUT HER CLOSER TO ABOUT 14, 15. Narrator: AS A RESULT, PEOPLE TEASED JENNIFER A LOT, AND SHE DOESN'T HAVE MANY FRIENDS. UNTIL IN 2008, WHEN SHE MEETS 15-YEAR-OLD ANGELA MARINUCCI.

 Capparelli: ANGELA -- SHE WAS VERY POLITE, VERY HELPFUL, VERY GOOD MANNERS. SHE WAS GREAT. Narrator: BUT, LIKE JENNIFER, SHE DOESN'T MAKE FRIENDS EASILY. HER INTERACTION WITH THE GUYS WAS SO MUCH SMOOTHER. ANGELA DID HAVE SOME TROUBLE GETTING ALONG WITH OTHER GIRLS -- SPECIFICALLY, IN HER OWN AGE. Narrator: BUT DESPITE THEIR DIFFERENCES, ANGELA AND JENNIFER IMMEDIATELY HIT IT OFF. JENN AND ANGELA LIKED TO DO GIRLY THINGS -- SLEEPOVERS, HANG OUT, HAVE DANCE PARTIES. [ LAUGHS ] Narrator: BY THE SUMMER OF 2009, JENNIFER AND ANGELA ARE BEST FRIENDS AND SPEND EVERY FREE MOMENT TOGETHER. Burkholder: ANGELA WAS DRAWN TO JENNIFER BECAUSE JENN WAS FUN AND SHE COULD BE CHILDISH AT TIMES. Narrator: AND JENNIFER LOVES HAVING A FRIEND WHO GIVES HER THE CONFIDENCE TO BE MORE INDEPENDENT. IT WAS VERY ENTICING FOR HER BECAUSE THAT'S HOW SHE WANTED TO LIVE HER LIFE -- BEING AN INDEPENDENT ADULT. Brennan: ANGELA WAS KIND TO JENNIFER. I DON'T THINK SHE EVER HAD THAT BEFORE, AND SO I THINK SHE WAS EXCITED TO HAVE THAT IN HER LIFE. Narrator: AND ANGELA'S EXCITED TO INTRODUCE JENNIFER TO HER NEW BOYFRIEND -- 23-YEAR-OLD RICKY SMYRNES. Brennan: RICKY WAS CHARMING. HE WAS HANDSOME. HE REALLY KNEW HOW TO TALK TO WOMEN AND SCHMOOZE. Narrator: AND SOON, HE STARTS PAYING ATTENTION TO ANGELA'S BEST FRIEND, JENNIFER. SHOCKINGLY, RICKY PUTS THE MOVES ON HER. HE SHOWED HER ATTENTION, AND SHE LIKED IT. WHEN JENNIFER WOULD TALK TO HIM ON THE PHONE, SHE WOULD GIGGLE AND LAUGH. Capparelli: RICKY'S THE TYPE OF GUY THAT JUST NEEDS CONSTANT CONFIRMATION THAT HE'S THE MAN. HE WAS TRYING TO AGITATE ANGELA JUST TO PURPOSELY MAKE HER JEALOUS. Narrator: WHEN RICKY'S FLIRTING INTENSIFIES, INSTEAD OF TALKING TO HIM ABOUT IT, ANGELA ANGRILY CONFRONTS JENNIFER. FROM ANGELA'S STANDPOINT, THAT WAS HER BOYFRIEND. "HANDS OFF. YOU DON'T PLAY ON MY PLAYGROUND." Narrator: JENNIFER, WHO HATES CONFLICT, IS DESPERATE TO SAVE HER FRIENDSHIP WITH ANGELA. SHE TELLS HER BEST FRIEND THAT SHE NEVER MEANT TO HURT HER AND BEGS FOR FORGIVENESS. JENNIFER TOLD ANGELA THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE RICKY AND SHE WASN'T PURSUING HIM, AND ANGELA, IN TURN, SAID THAT THAT WAS OKAY AND SORT OF FORGAVE JENNIFER. Narrator: BUT LITTLE DO THE FRIENDS KNOW, ANGELA IS HARBORING A GRUDGE. JENNIFER WAS A THREAT TO HER. ANGELA WANTED RICKY SMYRNES ALL TO HERSELF. HE WAS HERS. Narrator: AND SOON, ANGELA'S JEALOUSY WILL DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS AND LEAD TO HORRIFIC CONSEQUENCES. UNAWARE OF ANGELA'S BITTERNESS, JENNIFER FOCUSES ON HER FUTURE WITH RENEWED INTEREST. SHE BEGINS GOING TO A COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER AND JOINS A PROGRAM THAT HELPS HER LEARN TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. Murphy: SHE WANTED TO HAVE HER OWN APARTMENT, BUT I WAS AFRAID BECAUSE SHE WAS SO EASILY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. Narrator: WHILE JENNIFER IS EXCITED ABOUT HER GROWING INDEPENDENCE, HER FRIEND ANGELA'S LIFE IS BEGINNING TO SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL. SHE HAD SOME PROBLEMS AT HOME. SHE WAS SUSPENDED FROM HIGH SCHOOL FOR FIGHTING. SHE WAS KICKED OUT OF THE GREENSBURG LIBRARY FOR FIGHTING. HER MOTHER HAD A HARD TIME CONTROLLING HER. Narrator: AT HER WITS' END, ANGELA'S MOTHER DECIDES TO SEND HER TO THE SAME OUTREACH CENTER JENNIFER GOES TO BUT FOR A VERY DIFFERENT REASON. THEY WOULD WORK WITH HER ON ANGER ISSUES AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS, DEPRESSION ISSUES. Narrator: AND IRONICALLY, ANGELA'S BOYFRIEND, RICKY, HAS ISSUES OF HIS OWN. AFTER BEING ON PROBATION FOR ASSAULT AND BURGLARY, RICKY ALSO STARTS GOING TO THE CENTER FOR COURT-ORDERED ANGER-MANAGEMENT CLASSES. HE JUST LIKED TO CAUSE PROBLEMS EVERYWHERE HE WENT. Narrator: IT'S A STRANGE COINCIDENCE, BUT THE THREE FRIENDS ALL END UP SPENDING TIME AT THE COMMUNITY CENTER, ALONG WITH OTHERS. Capparelli: THE PROBLEM IS, THE PEOPLE THAT GO IN THE DROP-IN CENTERS ARE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISABILITIES, PEOPLE WITH ANGER ISSUES. IT'S A BREEDING GROUND FOR PEOPLE THAT DON'T FIT IN. Narrator: BUT JENNIFER AND ANGELA HAVE NO IDEA THEY ARE HEADING DOWN A DEVASTATING PATH OF BACK-STABBING, LIES, AND BETRAYAL. HOW COULD A PERSON GO FROM HAVING A FRIEND THAT YOU SAY YOU LOVE LIKE A SISTER TO ENACTING THE PLAN THAT SHE DID AND EXECUTING IT? IT'S INCREDIBLY TWISTED FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END. Narrator: BEST FRIENDS JENNIFER AND ANGELA BEGIN HANGING OUT WITH A TOUGH CROWD THEY MEET AT A COMMUNITY OUTREACH CENTER. Capparelli: THEY'RE A VERY NEGATIVE INFLUENCE -- PEOPLE THAT JUST HAVE A HARD TIME COPING IN LIFE. Narrator: IN LATE DECEMBER 2009, ANGELA INVITES JENNIFER TO HANG OUT WITH HER AT HER BOYFRIEND RICKY'S APARTMENT, WHERE HE'S LIVING WITH OTHER OUTCASTS FROM THE OUTREACH CENTER. THEY WERE OSTRACIZED BY SOCIETY, AND SO WHEN THEY FOUND EACH OTHER, THEY SORT OF MADE THEIR OWN FAMILY. Narrator: JENNIFER LOVES BEING PART OF THIS "FAMILY," AND BY JANUARY, SHE AND ANGELA ARE SPENDING SEVERAL NIGHTS A WEEK AT RICKY'S. THEY PARTIED CONSTANTLY FOR DAYS AT A TIME. ALL THAT MY MOTHER AND I WERE TOLD WAS THAT SHE WAS SPENDING THE NIGHT WITH HER GOOD FRIEND. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH RICKY IS GOING OUT WITH ANGELA, HE STILL WANTS TO HOOK UP WITH JENNIFER, AND JUST LIKE BEFORE, HE CONTINUES TO FLIRT WITH HER, AND IT SEEMS AS IF HE DOESN'T CARE IF ANGELA KNOWS. OH, I'M SURE THAT MADE HER MAD AS HELL. HE PLAYED THESE TWO GIRLS AGAINST EACH OTHER. RICKY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT JENNIFER OR ANGELA. HE WANTED WHAT HE WANTED, AND IT DIDN'T MATTER TO RICKY WHOSE FRIENDSHIPS OR RELATIONSHIPS HE DESTROYED. Narrator: RICKY KEEPS HITTING ON JENNIFER UNTIL IN FEBRUARY 2010, SHE FINALLY GIVES IN AND HAS SEX WITH RICKY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. JENNIFER WAS MENTALLY CHALLENGED, AND I THINK IT WAS HARD FOR HER TO MAKE FRIENDS. I THINK AS SOON AS SOMEONE PAID HER ANY BIT OF ATTENTION, SHE GRABBED ON TO THAT PERSON. ALL SHE WANTED WAS FOR HIM TO LIKE HER. IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING TO HER. SHE DIDN'T HAVE THAT MENTALITY. Narrator: BUT ALL TOO SOON, ANGELA FINDS OUT ABOUT THE HOOK-UPS AFTER OVERHEARING RICKY TALKING ON THE PHONE WITH JENNIFER. WHEN ANGELA FOUND OUT, IT SET HER OFF. WELL, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE STEALING SOMEBODY'S BOYFRIEND, THAT WOULD'VE MADE HER VERY MAD -- VERY ANGRY. Narrator: ANGELA HAS BEEN WARNING JENNIFER TO STAY AWAY FROM RICKY FOR MONTHS, AND NOW HER WORST FEARS HAVE COME TRUE. ANGELA JUST WASN'T THE TYPE TO ACTUALLY FORGIVE. THAT'S WHEN ANGELA DECIDED, "I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS." Narrator: IN ANGELA'S MIND, HER BEST FRIEND HAS JUST COMMITTED THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. SHE WAS JEALOUS. SHE WAS ANGRY. SHE WAS VERY ANGRY. SHE WANTED TO MAKE JENNIFER PAY. Narrator: THE SITUATION COMES TO A HEAD WHEN ANGELA LEARNS THAT JENNIFER IS PLANNING TO MOVE OUT OF HER MOM'S HOUSE AND GET A PLACE OF HER OWN. Capparelli: ANGELA THOUGHT THAT JENN WAS GETTING AN APARTMENT TO SET UP A LITTLE LOVE NEST FOR HER AND RICKY SMYRNES. Murphy: ANGELA GOES INTO A RAGE. THAT'S WHEN SOMETHING IN HER KIND OF SNAPPED. Narrator: ANGELA VOWS TO PUNISH JENNIFER AT ANY COST. MEANWHILE, JENNIFER HAS NO IDEA THAT HER BEST FRIEND IS OUT FOR REVENGE. JENNIFER'S MENTAL CAPACITY WAS THAT OF A TEENAGER. SHE SORT OF HAD A ROSY VIEW OF EVERYBODY. SHE WAS NAIVE. I DON'T THINK HE HAD ANY IDEA WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. Narrator: SEETHING WITH RAGE, ANGELA HATCHES A SHOCKING PLAN FOR REVENGE AGAINST JENNIFER. FIRST, SHE TEXTS JENNIFER, INVITING HER TO COME OVER TO RICKY'S APARTMENT. SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO THE APARTMENT FOR A COUPLE OF FUN DAYS WITH HER FRIENDS. JENNIFER WAS REALLY EXCITED. Narrator: LITTLE DOES JENNIFER KNOW THAT ANGELA IS SETTING A TRAP THAT WILL LEAD TO A BLOODY CHAIN OF EVENTS. I WOULD'VE NEVER, EVER FOR A SECOND THOUGHT SHE COULD DO SOMETHING SO HEINOUSLY WRONG. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY LIKE THEY WERE A PACK OF WOLVES. ONCE ONE STARTED, IT JUST ESCALATED. Narrator: ANGELA IS IN A RAGE AFTER JENNIFER SLEEPS WITH HER BOYFRIEND, RICKY, SO SHE LURES HER BEST FRIEND TO RICKY'S APARTMENT TO GET REVENGE FOR HER BETRAYAL. SHE DIDN'T KNOW THAT ANGELA WAS LURING HER INTO THIS TRAP. Narrator: JENNIFER ARRIVES AT RICKY'S ON MONDAY NIGHT. HE'S THERE, ALONG WITH THREE OTHER FRIENDS FROM THE COMMUNITY CENTER. JENNIFER SHOWED UP MONDAY NIGHT, AND THINGS WERE FINE -- CALM. IT WAS JUST A NORMAL GROUP OF FRIENDS HANGING OUT. Narrator: BUT THE NEXT MORNING, THINGS TAKE A TURN FOR THE WORSE. WHILE JENNIFER IS IN THE BATHROOM TAKING A SHOWER, ANGELA SEIZES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXECUTE HER PLAN FOR REVENGE. SHE GATHERS THE OTHERS TOGETHER AND PERSUADES THEM TO HELP HER PUNISH HER FRIEND. IT'S NOT VERY HARD TO CONVINCE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WITH ANGER ISSUES, VIOLENCE ISSUES, THAT THIS PERSON IS A HORRIBLE INFLUENCE AND SHOULDN'T BE PERMITTED TO BE IN WITH OUR GROUP. Narrator: ANGELA AND THE OTHERS GO THROUGH JENNIFER'S PURSE. THEY STEAL HER MONEY AND CELLPHONE AND POUR MOUTHWASH AND MAKEUP ALL OVER HER BELONGINGS. WHEN JENNIFER COMES OUT, JENNIFER IS IRATE. WHAT DID YOU DO?! Narrator: BUT JENNIFER'S ANGER ONLY SERVES TO FUEL THE GROUP. LITTLE DOES JENNIFER KNOW, HER BEST FRIEND -- THE PERSON SHE TRUSTS THE MOST -- IS ABOUT TO BEGIN A VIOLENT ATTACK. I MEAN, IT WENT FROM, "I'M TAKING YOUR PURSE. I'M TAKING YOUR $8," TO BEATING HER AND TAKING TURNS BEATING HER. [ SOBBING, SHOUTING ] Narrator: ANGELA CONVINCES THE OTHERS TO HIT JENNIFER REPEATEDLY. THEN THEY DRAW ON HER FACE WITH NAIL POLISH. Brennan: THEY THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY TO TORMENT HER, TO SEE HER HURT AND TO SEE HER CRY, AND TO UPSET HER. Narrator: JENNIFER IS TERRIFIED, BUT SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE WHEREWITHAL TO ESCAPE FROM HER TORMENTERS. Brennan: SHE WAS OUT-NUMBERED. IT'S SIX AGAINST ONE. Narrator: MEANWHILE, THE ABUSE CONTINUES TO ESCALATE AND SOON REACHES A NEW LEVEL OF HORROR. THEY HUMILIATED HER AND HURT HER IN EVERY WAY THEY COULD, INCLUDING CUTTING HER HAIR OFF WITH A KNIFE AND CUTTING INTO HER SCALP. Brennan: THE MOB MENTALITY KICKED IN, AND THOSE PEOPLE DID THINGS THAT MAYBE BY THEMSELVES WOULD NOT DO. Burkholder: THEY DRUGGED HER. THEY FORCED HER TO DRINK DETERGENT. THEY FORCED HER TO DRINK URINE AND FECES. IT WAS JUST UNIMAGINABLE. AFTER THEY DID THAT, THEN SHE STARTED THROWING UP. [ Voice breaking ] I'M SORRY. Narrator: BLEEDING AND BATTERED, A CONFUSED JENNIFER DESPERATELY CALLS OUT TO HER BEST FRIEND, ANGELA, FOR HELP. I'M SURE SHE LOOKED AT ANGELA AND THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, "HOW CAN YOU BE DOING THIS TO ME? HOW CAN MY BEST FRIEND BE DOING THIS TO ME?" I CAN PICTURE THAT POOR CHILD SAYING, "BUT YOU'RE MY FRIENDS," AND NOT EVEN UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE OF HER MENTALITY AND NOT EVEN UNDERSTANDING WHAT WAS GOING ON. Narrator: BUT JENNIFER'S ANGUISHED PLEAS FALL ON DEAF EARS. ANGELA IS DETERMINED TO MAKE HER SUFFER. IT MAKES ME SICK TO THINK THAT ANGELA WAS LOVING THIS AND GETTING ENJOYMENT FROM THIS. Narrator: BUT SHOCKINGLY, JENNIFER'S TERRIFYING ORDEAL ISN'T OVER YET. THE WORST IS STILL TO COME. TO JENNIFER'S HORROR, ONE OF THE MEN SUDDENLY PULLS HER INTO A BEDROOM AND THEN BRUTALLY RAPES HER. I CAN'T IMAGINE. I GUESS IT WAS JUST SOME SICK OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM. Narrator: UNBELIEVABLY, THE HORRENDOUS ABUSE CONTINUES INTO THE NEXT DAY. THEY'VE RAPED HER, THEY'VE DONE EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE TO THIS KID, AND YET, JENN WAS STILL ALIVE. Narrator: LATER THAT NIGHT, A NEIGHBOR CALLS POLICE AFTER HEARING SCREAMS COMING FROM THE APARTMENT. NOW THERE'S HOPE JENNIFER WILL BE RESCUED JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME. THE POLICE SHOWING UP AT SUCH A PIVOTAL POINT -- I THINK IT CERTAINLY TERRIFIED THEM THAT THEY WERE THAT CLOSE TO BEING CAUGHT. IF POLICE FIND HER, HOPEFULLY THEY CAN PUT AN END TO THIS TORTURE. [ SIRENS WAIL ] Narrator: JENNIFER HAS ENDURED UNSPEAKABLE TORTURE AT THE HANDS OF HER BEST FRIEND, ANGELA, AND FIVE OTHER PEOPLE SHE TRUSTS. WHAT HAPPENED TO HER WAS SO INCREDIBLY HORRIFIC, IT WAS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY COULD'VE BELIEVED THAT FRIENDS WOULD TURN ON ANOTHER ONE. [ SIRENS WAIL ] Narrator: BUT NOW THERE'S A CHANCE JENNIFER WILL BE RESCUED AFTER A NEIGHBOR HEARS SCREAMS AND CALLS 911. POLICE ARRIVE ON THE SCENE, AND THE GROUP SCRAMBLES TO HIDE JENNIFER IN THE ATTIC. AND THEY TOLD HER, "IF YOU MAKE ANY NOISE, WE'LL KILL YOU." Narrator: THEN, ANGELA'S BOYFRIEND, RICKY, RUSHES OUTSIDE TO TALK TO POLICE. AND RICKY BASICALLY SAID, YOU KNOW, "EVERYTHING'S FINE. I'M SORRY. WE'LL KEEP IT DOWN." Narrator: SMOOTH-TALKING RICKY CONVINCES THE OFFICERS THAT NOTHING IS GOING ON, AND THEY EVENTUALLY LEAVE. THEY NEVER WENT INTO THE APARTMENT. THEY NEVER SUSPECTED THAT SHE WAS THERE. [ SIRENS WAIL ] Narrator: AFTER SUCH A CLOSE CALL, THE GROUP BEGINS TO PANIC. THEY WERE AFRAID JENN'S PARENTS WERE GONNA SHOW UP, AND THEY HAD TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHAT IT WAS THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH JENN. Narrator: IN A CHILLING MOVE, A COLD-HEARTED ANGELA DECIDES THAT HER FORMER BEST FRIEND DOESN'T DESERVE TO LIVE. ANGELA MADE THE STATEMENT, "I WANT THE [BLEEP] DEAD." I THINK PEOPLE WERE AFRAID OF ANGELA. SHE COULD BE SCARY ENOUGH THAT OTHER PEOPLE WOULD DO WHAT SHE TOLD THEM TO DO. AND THAT'S WHEN IT WAS DECIDED AMONGST THE SIX OF THEM THAT THEY HAD TO KILL HER. Narrator: ANGELA CONVINCES ONE OF THE MEN TO DO HER DIRTY WORK. Capparelli: I THINK SHE HAD THE BRAINS TO MASTERMIND IT, BUT WHEN PUSH COMES TO SHOVE, I DON'T THINK SHE HAD THE COURAGE TO FINISH IT. Narrator: THE GROUP DRAGS JENNIFER DOWN FROM THE ATTIC. BUT I DON'T THINK SHE REALLY THOUGHT THEY WOULD KILL HER. Narrator: THEN, A HYSTERICAL JENNIFER IS FORCED INTO THE BATHROOM AND VICIOUSLY STABBED SEVERAL TIMES. SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DIE. SHE WAS A FIGHTER. Narrator: BUT THE ASSAULT ON JENNIFER IS FAR FROM OVER. ACCORDING TO PROSECUTORS, RICKY THEN DELIBERATELY SLITS JENNIFER'S WRISTS. FINALLY, ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT, 33 HOURS AFTER THE BRUTAL TORTURE BEGAN, JENNIFER DIES. SHE IS ONLY 30 YEARS OLD. SHE FOUGHT FOR HER LIFE UNTIL SHE COULD NOT FIGHT ANYMORE. AND I'M PROUD OF HER FOR THAT. Narrator: BUT ANGELA ISN'T FINISHED WITH HER FRIEND YET. AS A FINAL INDIGNITY, SHE ORDERS THE GROUP TO WRAP JENNIFER'S BODY IN CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. THEN, THEY STUFF HER INTO A GARBAGE CAN AND DUMP HER BODY IN A PARKING LOT AT A NEARBY SCHOOL. SHE WANTED JENNIFER TO BE FOUND WITH CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AROUND HER. SHE DID EVERYTHING NASTY THAT SHE COULD DO TO JENNIFER, AND, TO HER, IT WAS LIKE A CROWNING GLORY OR SOMETHING. Narrator: POLICE FIND JENNIFER'S BODY AT THE SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING, WHERE, UNBELIEVABLY, ANGELA AND RICKY TURN UP A FEW HOURS LATER. THEY CAME BACK TO THE CRIME SCENE AND WANTED TO KNOW, "HEY, MAN. WHAT'S GOING ON?" Narrator: POLICE IMMEDIATELY LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION... [ SIRENS WAIL ] ...AND IT ONLY TAKES THEM 12 HOURS TO ARREST ANGELA AND THE OTHERS. THEY ARE CHARGED WITH CONSPIRACY, KIDNAPPING, AND CRIMINAL HOMICIDE. ALTHOUGH JENNIFER'S FORMER BEST FRIEND, 17-YEAR-OLD ANGELA MARINUCCI, IS A MINOR AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER, SHE IS CONVICTED OF ALL CHARGES AND SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE. SHE DIDN'T SEEM REMORSEFUL AT ALL. SHE SEEMED PROUD OF WHAT HAPPENED. I HOPE SHE NEVER SEES THE LIGHT OF DAY AGAIN. Narrator: MELVIN KNIGHT CONFESSES TO STABBING JENNIFER AND IS GIVEN THE DEATH PENALTY. RICKY SMYRNES, PEGGY MILLER, ROBERT MASTERS, JR., AND AMBER MEIDINGER HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH CRIMINAL HOMICIDE, AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, AND KIDNAPPING. THEY ARE STILL AWAITING TRIAL. Burkholder: I DON'T THINK ANY OF THOSE SIX DESERVE TO WALK AS A FREE PERSON. THERE WERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE TO STOP AT ANY TIME AND JUST WALK AWAY, AND THEY CONSCIOUSLY CHOSE NOT TO. Narrator: TODAY, JENNIFER'S FAMILY STILL STRUGGLES TO COPE WITH THEIR TERRIBLE LOSS. I PROTECTED JENNIFER AS BEST AS I COULD, AND, YOU KNOW, THAT ONE TIME I COULDN'T. MY WHOLE LIFE WAS SPENT STICKING UP FOR MY SISTER, BEATING PEOPLE UP BECAUSE THEY PICKED ON HER BECAUSE SHE WAS DIFFERENT. I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THE GOODNESS SHE HAD. SHE WAS JUST SO HAPPY ALL THE TIME. ♪ FA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA LA [ Crying ] SHE TOLD EVERYBODY THAT I WAS HER HERO, AND [SNIFFLES] SHE WAS MINE. Narrator: EVEN HARDER FOR THE FAMILY -- COMING TO TERMS WITH THE FACT THAT JENNIFER'S CLOSEST FRIEND, ANGELA, COMMITTED SUCH A VICIOUS CRIME. I COULDN'T IMAGINE STRANGERS DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS, BUT TO DO THIS TO SOMEBODY THAT YOU TOLD YOU LOVED LIKE A SISTER -- [SIGHS] UNIMAGINABLE. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW YOU COULD DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SOMEONE SO INNOCENT, LET ALONE A FRIEND.
