 TO AFFORD THE LUXURIES SHE CRAVES AND TO GIVE HER KIDS A GOOD LIFE. SHE WAS USED TO BEING INDEPENDENT AND TAKING CARE OF HERSELF AND OTHER PEOPLE. Narrator: BRENDA KNOWS THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE IN VEGAS, AND SHE LANDS A JOB IN THE HEART OF THE STRIP. SHE GOT THIS GREAT JOB AS A BLACKJACK DEALER AT THE BELLAGIO HOTEL. Stokes: HERE WE GO, LADIES AND GENTS. Narrator: ONE EVENING WHILE ON A BREAK, BRENDA STRIKES UP A CONVERSATION WITH FELLOW BLACKJACK DEALER, JOYCE RHONE. LIKE BRENDA, 37-YEAR-OLD JOYCE IS ALSO A SINGLE MOM. SHE HAS FOUR CHILDREN. Coombs: SHARING ABOUT THEIR LIVES, THEY REALIZED THEY HAD SO MUCH IN COMMON. JOYCE LOVED HER JOB AND SHE WAS DEDICATED TO IT. JOYCE IS A WONDERFUL PERSON, A VERY SPIRITUAL PERSON. Narrator: JOYCE MOVED TO LAS VEGAS FROM A SMALL NEVADA TOWN IN 1988. SHE ALWAYS DREAMED OF WORKING ON THE FAMOUS STRIP. Gewerter: SHE WENT TO GAMING SCHOOL, AND SHE BECAME A CARD DEALER. AND THEN SHE GOT A JOB FOR THE BELLAGIO. Narrator: WHEN SHE'S NOT IN THE CASINO, JOYCE IS A HOMEBODY AND LOVES TO ENTERTAIN. FAMILY IS HER LIFE. BETWEEN WORKING FULL TIME THE WAY SHE DID, TAKING CARE OF KIDS, AND SHE HAD VERY LITTLE TIME LEFT FOR ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE. Narrator: BUT WHEN SHE MEETS BRENDA, THE TWO IMMEDIATELY HIT IT OFF, AND BEFORE LONG, ARE SOCIALIZING OUTSIDE OF THE CASINO. Coombs: THEY WOULD SHOP, THEY WOULD GO TO LUNCH, AND THEY ENDED UP BECOMING BEST FRIENDS. Narrator: ONE OF THE MANY THINGS BRENDA SHARES WITH JOYCE IS THAT SHE IS LOOKING FOR LOVE. LITTLE DO THE BEST FRIENDS KNOW THAT YEARS LATER, THEIR DESIRE FOR LOVE AND HAPPINESS WILL LEAD TO A HORRIFIC SHOWDOWN. TWO YEARS INTO THEIR FRIENDSHIP IN 2007, JOYCE AND BRENDA ARE OUT TO LUNCH WHEN BRENDA BLURTS OUT THAT SHE'S GOT SOME BIG NEWS. SHE'S MET A MAN AND IS SMITTEN. HIS NAME IS PHILLIP MORRIS, AND HE'S RECENTLY SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE, TE'JUANA. Reeves: BRENDA SAW A GOOD-LOOKING MAN. HE WAS FUN. ALWAYS WANTING TO GO OUT AND DO THINGS AND TRAVEL. SOMEONE THAT COULD KEEP HER FEELING YOUNG AND SOMEONE THAT SHE COULD SHOW OFF TO HER FRIENDS. Narrator: WHEN BRENDA IS WITH JOYCE, ALL SHE CAN TALK ABOUT IS THE FUN SHE'S HAVING IN HER NEW RELATIONSHIP. SHE BELIEVES SHE'S FINALLY FOUND THE ONE. I THINK THAT BRENDA AND PHILLIP COMPLEMENTED EACH OTHER. THE TWO OF THEM BOTH LIKED PARTYING AND BEING OUT, AND THEY LIKED THE NIGHT LIFE. Narrator: BRENDA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH PHILLIP RAMPS UP QUICKLY, AND AFTER SIX MONTHS, HE MOVES IN WITH HER, AND TO ILLUSTRATE HIS COMMITMENT, PHILLIP SHOWS UP ONE DAY WITH A VERY MODERN-DAY SYMBOL OF HIS DEVOTION. OOH. HE DOES HAVE HER FULL NAME TATTOOED ON HIS ARM. IT GOT PRETTY SERIOUS. WHEN PHILLIP FIRST GOT THE TATTOO, I THOUGHT, "WELL, MAYBE HE'S FOUND HIS GIRL, FINALLY." Narrator: JOYCE IS GENUINELY HAPPY FOR BRENDA, BUT SHE ALSO MISSES HER FRIEND AND THE TIME THEY USED TO SPEND TOGETHER. Coombs: IT USED TO BE ALL ABOUT BRENDA AND JOYCE, BUT NOW BRENDA IS TOTALLY INFATUATED WITH PHILLIP. NOW JOYCE IS FEELING LEFT OUT AND SHE'S FEELING LONELY, AND SHE'S TRYING HARD NOT TO BE JEALOUS. Narrator: JOYCE SHARES HER FEELINGS, BUT BRENDA GETS DEFENSIVE. BRENDA IS SO TAKEN UP BY THIS NEW ROMANCE, AND SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND WHY JOYCE ISN'T JUST TOTALLY HAPPY FOR HER. Narrator: BUT ULTIMATELY, BRENDA WANTS TO PLEASE JOYCE, SO SHE STARTS INVITING HER OUT ALONG WITH PHILLIP. BRENDA'S TRYING TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY, SO ALL THREE OF THEM GO SHOPPING, GO OUT TO DINNER, SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER. Narrator: BRENDA FEELS LIKE SHE HIT THE JACKPOT. HER BEST FRIEND AND HER BOYFRIEND GET ALONG SO WELL. Reeves: PHILLIP WAS THE LIFE OF THE PARTY. ALWAYS UPBEAT. "LET'S GO OUT. BRING YOUR GIRLFRIENDS. I'M TREATING THEM, TOO." Narrator: JOYCE IS IMPRESSED WITH BRENDA'S FUN-LOVING BOYFRIEND. THEY SEEMED TO HIT IT OFF AND ENJOY EACH OTHER'S COMPANY. Narrator: EVEN THOUGH SHE TRUSTS JOYCE, THERE'S A SMALL PART OF BRENDA THAT FEELS INSECURE ABOUT HAVING PHILLIP AROUND HER. AND GIVEN PHILLIP'S PAST, SHE MAY HAVE REASON FOR CONCERN. SERIAL WOMANIZING ENDED HIS MARRIAGE. Reeves: HE WAS SEEING OTHER WOMEN. THERE WERE PHONE CALLS, TEXT MESSAGES THAT I WOULD SEE, AND I WOULD TRY TO IGNORE IT. Narrator: BUT THERE IS NO IGNORING PHILLIP AND JOYCE'S CONNECTION. THEY HAD A VERY GOOD RAPPORT BETWEEN THEM. Narrator: AND SOON, JEALOUSY AND BROKEN TRUST WILL SEND THESE FRIENDS DOWN A SHOCKING AND DEADLY PATH. THIS IS NOT THE SAME WOMAN THAT SHE KNEW FOR ALL THESE YEARS. SHE HAD ALREADY MADE UP HER MIND WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO. Narrator: BRENDA STARTS INCLUDING HER FRIEND JOYCE WHEN SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND, PHILLIP, GO OUT ON THE TOWN. BUT ONE EVENING WHEN JOYCE AND PHILLIP HOLD GAZES A LITTLE TOO LONG AND LAUGH A LITTLE TOO LOUDLY, BRENDA STARTS TO GET JEALOUS. JOYCE AND PHILLIP HAD A VERY EASY RAPPORT. Narrator: LATER, BRENDA CONFRONTS JOYCE ABOUT FLIRTING WITH HER BOYFRIEND. WHY WOULD YOU ACCUSE ME OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT? I'M YOUR FRIEND. JOYCE IS OFFENDED AND REACTS. "HOW COULD YOU ACCUSE ME OF THAT?" AND SHE GETS UPSET. Narrator: BRENDA BACKS DOWN, AND IT APPEARS THE LONGTIME FRIENDS HAVE SMOOTHED THINGS OVER. Coombs: JOYCE THINKS EVERYTHING'S OKAY, BUT WHEN THEY'RE AT WORK TOGETHER, THEY'RE NOT AS FRIENDLY AS THEY USED TO BE. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO WOMEN. Narrator: THREE YEARS INTO THEIR RELATIONSHIP, BRENDA IS SO HAPPY TO HAVE PHILLIP, SHE DOESN'T WANT TO RISK LOSING HIM, SO SHE BEGINS LAVISHING HIM WITH ATTENTION. BRENDA WAS SUPPORTING PHILLIP. HE LIKES TO BE CATERED TO AND TAKEN CARE OF. Narrator: BRENDA ALSO HELPS TAKE CARE OF PHILLIP'S YOUNG DAUGHTER, JADE. JADE SAID BRENDA WAS REALLY NICE. THEY WENT TO CARNIVALS, AND THEY WOULD ALWAYS GO SHOPPING. Narrator: BUT THINGS STILL AREN'T THE SAME BETWEEN JOYCE AND BRENDA SINCE BRENDA ACCUSED HER OF FLIRTING WITH HER BOYFRIEND. Coombs: JOYCE IS UPSET ABOUT BRENDA'S ACCUSATIONS TO THE POINT WHERE SHE STARTS TO PULL BACK A BIT AT WORK, SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THE OTHER EMPLOYEES. Narrator: AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE, BRENDA SUSPECTS JOYCE IS GOSSIPING ABOUT HER TO THEIR FELLOW CO-WORKERS. BRENDA, SHE KEEPS HAVING ALL THESE DOUBTS BUBBLING INSIDE HER. Narrator: BRENDA BECOMES MORE AND MORE PARANOID, AND THE GAP BETWEEN BRENDA AND JOYCE WIDENS. FUELING HER ANXIETY, PHILLIP OFTEN ASKS BRENDA TO INCLUDE JOYCE IN THEIR PLANS. SHE CAN'T SHAKE THE GNAWING FEELING THAT SOMETHING IS GOING ON. Coombs: THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PHILLIP AND JOYCE PLAYS ON ALL OF BRENDA'S INSECURITIES. SHE'S OLDER. BRENDA'S STARTING TO WONDER, "MAYBE THEY'RE A BETTER COUPLE THAN PHILLIP AND I." Narrator: AS BRENDA'S INSECURITIES GROW, BACKSTABBING AND LIES WILL SET IN MOTION A VIOLENT CHAIN OF EVENTS. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRAZY AND EVIL. CRAZY DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAN THINGS OUT. EVIL DOES. Narrator: BRENDA CAN'T ESCAPE THE FEELING THAT HER FRIEND JOYCE IS MESSING AROUND WITH HER BOYFRIEND, PHILLIP. Coombs: SHE'S WONDERING, "IS THERE SOMETHING GOING ON BEHIND MY BACK? "CAN I REALLY NOT TRUST MY BOYFRIEND WITH MY FRIEND, JOYCE?" Narrator: ONE EVENING WHEN PHILLIP COMES HOME LATE, BRENDA DECIDES TO CONFRONT HIM REGARDING HER SUSPICIONS ABOUT HE AND JOYCE. ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH JOYCE? NO. WHEN SHE DOES, HE'S SHOCKED. HE SAYS, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? "I CARE ABOUT YOU. YOU'RE MY GIRLFRIEND. LOOK AT THE TATTOO ON MY ARM." Narrator: WORRIED HE MIGHT BE LOSING BRENDA, PHILLIP SUDDENLY ASKS HER TO MARRY HIM. WILL YOU MARRY ME? REALLY? YES. OF COURSE. YES. BRENDA IS ELATED. SHE'S FINALLY GETTING THE COMMITMENT SHE WANTS AFTER FIVE YEARS OF DATING. SHE IS EQUALLY EXCITED ABOUT OFFICIALLY BECOMING JADE'S STEP-MOM. Flanagan-Jones: THEY HAD SO MUCH FUN WITH EACH OTHER THAT EVEN WITHOUT PHILLIP, BRENDA WANTED TO COME PICK JADE UP, AND JADE WANTED TO TALK TO BRENDA. Narrator: BRENDA SHARES THE GOOD NEWS WITH JOYCE. NOW THAT THERE'S A RING, THAT GIVES HER THE SECURITY SHE'S BEEN LOOKING FOR, AND SHE HOPES THEIR RELATIONSHIP CAN RETURN TO WHAT IT USED TO BE. JOYCE SEEMS ECSTATIC FOR HER AND SAYS CONGRATULATIONS. Narrator: JOYCE APPEARS HAPPY ON THE SURFACE. INSIDE, SHE WONDERS IF MARRYING PHILLIP IS THE RIGHT STEP FOR HER FRIEND TO TAKE, ESPECIALLY KNOWING HIS CHEATING WAYS AND BRENDA'S OBVIOUS INSECURITIES. JOYCE NOW REALIZES THIS IS ONE STEP FURTHER AWAY AS BRENDA'S GETTING MARRIED, AND ALL OF THESE UNSPOKEN FEELINGS ARE NOT SAID OUT LOUD. [ SLOTS RINGING ] Narrator: IN THE FALL OF 2012, SEVEN YEARS INTO THEIR FRIENDSHIP, THINGS SEEM BACK TO NORMAL BETWEEN THE TWO WOMEN WHEN ONE DAY AT WORK, BRENDA TELLS JOYCE SHE'S PLANNING A BIG BIRTHDAY PARTY FOR HERSELF. COMING TO THE PARTY, RIGHT? ABSOLUTELY. Gewerter: IT WAS BRENDA'S 50th BIRTHDAY, SO SHE THREW A PARTY FOR HERSELF AND INVITED A BUNCH OF HER FRIENDS. Narrator: THE AFTERNOON OF THE PARTY, JOYCE IS ONE OF THE FIRST GUESTS TO ARRIVE. SHE BRINGS BRENDA A GIFT AND GOES OFF TO ENJOY THE EVENT. LATER ON, BRENDA NOTICES PHILLIP AND JOYCE ARE TALKING ATTENTIVELY ACROSS THE ROOM. PHILLIP AND JOYCE KIND OF, YOU KNOW, WERE IN CORNERS TOGETHER TALKING, AND HE WAS FLIRTING. Narrator: BRENDA'S INCENSED. DESPITE HER ENGAGEMENT, SHE'S NOW CONVINCED THEY ARE SLEEPING TOGETHER. AND SHE FEELS BETRAYED BY HER BEST FRIEND. Coombs: THEY HAD BEEN BEST FRIENDS FOR ALL THESE YEARS, AND NOW IT MIGHT BE ALL IMPLODING. Narrator: BRENDA MARCHES STRAIGHT OVER TO JOYCE AND PHILLIP AND MAKES A BIG SCENE, ACCUSING THEM OF CHEATING ON HER. WHAT IS GOING ON BACK HERE? SERIOUSLY? IT'S YOUR OPINION. I KNOW IT'S MY OPINION. DON'T DO THIS HERE. DON'T DO THIS HERE. Coombs: JOYCE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT BRENDA IS STILL HOLDING ONTO THIS. HOW COULD BRENDA KEEP ACCUSING HER, HER BEST FRIEND, OF TRYING TO TAKE HER BOYFRIEND AWAY. Narrator: PHILLIP GETS ANGRY AND LEAVES BRENDA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY... ...WHILE JOYCE TRIES HARD TO CONVINCE HER FRIEND IT'S ALL IN HER HEAD. LISTEN TO YOURSELF! YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON. YOU'RE GONNA LOSE HIM OVER THIS. FINALLY, BRENDA BACKS DOWN AND WALKS AWAY, BUT INSIDE, SHE IS SEETHING. PHILLIP IS SICK AND TIRED OF BRENDA'S ACCUSATIONS, AND A FEW DAYS LATER, CALLS OFF THEIR ENGAGEMENT. I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE. NO, DON'T DO THIS. DON'T DO THIS, PHILLIP. Coombs: BRENDA CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. HER LIFE IS NOW RUINED. Narrator: BRENDA IS CONVINCED JOYCE IS THE REASON, BUT SHE NEEDS PROOF. BEFORE PHILLIP MOVES OUT, SHE SEARCHES FOR EVIDENCE. SHE FINDS A COPY OF HIS CELLPHONE BILL AND IS SHOCKED BY WHAT SHE SEES. PHILLIP AND JOYCE WERE TEXTING EACH OTHER BACK AND FORTH. IT WAS ABOUT FOUR PAGES OF A PHONE BILL OF TEXTS BETWEEN JOYCE AND PHILLIP. Narrator: NOW BRENDA THINKS SHE FINALLY HAS ALL THE PROOF SHE NEEDS. CONSUMED WITH RAGE OVER HER BEST FRIEND'S BETRAYAL, BRENDA HATCHES A VICIOUS PLOT TO EXACT REVENGE. SHE THOUGHT THAT NOBODY WOULD HEAR HER SCREAM. THIS WAS THE ULTIMATE BETRAYAL. [ DOORBELL RINGS ] [ SCREAMS ] Narrator: BRENDA IS FURIOUS AFTER DISCOVERING THAT HER FIANCé HAS BEEN TEXTING BACK AND FORTH WITH HER BEST FRIEND, JOYCE. SHE IS ALL BUT CERTAIN THEY HAVE BEEN HAVING AN AFFAIR. SHE'S TOTALLY SHOCKED THAT HER FRIEND WOULD JUST TURN ON HER. Narrator: ON DECEMBER 21, 2012, AT 9:30 P.M., JOYCE IS HARD AT WORK AT THE BELLAGIO. IT'S BRENDA'S NIGHT OFF, AND SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE BLACKJACK TABLES. Narrator: JOYCE SEES HER FRIEND SLOWLY MAKING HER WAY TO HER TABLE BUT HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S IN STORE. BRENDA HAS COME TO THE BELLAGIO ARMED FOR BATTLE. Gewerter: SHE HAD THE RAZOR BLADES LINED UP BETWEEN HER KNUCKLES IN BOTH HANDS, WENT INTO THE PIT AREA. LITTLE DID ANY OF THESE PEOPLE KNOW THAT BRENDA HAD HORRIBLE ANGER INSIDE HER. [ SCREAMING ] Gewerter: AT FIRST, JOYCE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. [ SCREAMING ] SHE ATTACKS JOYCE VICIOUSLY, CUTTING HER FACE FROM EAR TO MOUTH AND ALL AROUND HER EYES. [ SCREAMING CONTINUES ] THE FIRST PERSON TO ACTUALLY GET TO THE TWO WOMEN WAS A PATRON. AS HE PULLED THE WOMEN APART, HE COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW MUCH BLOOD WAS POURING FROM JOYCE'S FACE. Flanagan-Jones: IF THAT MAN HADN'T JUMPED ON BRENDA, SHE WOULD'VE KILLED JOYCE. SHE WAS NOT GONNA STOP. WHEN JOYCE REALIZED THAT IT WAS BRENDA, SHE WAS IN A BIGGER SHOCK. SHE NEVER EXPECTED HER FRIEND TO ATTACK HER, AND JOYCE HAD NO CLUE WHY BRENDA WAS ATTACKING HER. [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ] Narrator: AS THE BRAVE PATRON HOLDS ON TO BRENDA, JOYCE IS IN A DAZE, BLEEDING PROFUSELY. A COCKTAIL WAITRESS RUSHES TO HER AID UNTIL PARAMEDICS ARRIVE. [ SIREN WAILING ] THE SLASHES TO HER FACE WERE JUST GRUESOME. JOYCE'S FACE WAS JUST SLICED OPEN. SHE WAS ABOUT SECONDS AWAY FROM BEING KILLED. Narrator: POLICE ARRIVE AND TAKE BRENDA INTO CUSTODY. THEY CHARGE HER WITH ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. WHEN THE POLICE CAME, BRENDA SAID, "IF YOU DIDN'T STOP ME, I WOULD'VE KILLED HER." Narrator: THE FOLLOWING DAY, AS POLICE QUESTION BRENDA, PHILLIP'S EX-WIFE, TE'JUANA, ARRIVES AT THE STATION. SHE'S FRANTIC. I'M HERE TO REPORT MY DAUGHTER MISSING. SHE TELLS POLICE HER 10-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER, JADE, HAD BEEN PICKED UP BY BRENDA THE DAY BEFORE AND NEVER RETURNED. Reeves: FOR, LIKE, THREE YEARS IN A ROW, BRENDA WOULD COME AND GET JADE AND TAKE HER CHRISTMAS SHOPPING, YOU KNOW. BUT THIS PARTICULAR DAY, SHE DIDN'T CALL ME BEFORE SHE CAME. NORMALLY, SHE WOULD CALL OR I WOULD GET A CALL FROM PHILLIP, AND SHE WOULD SAY, "I'M GONNA TAKE HER TO THE MALL UP THE STREET. I SHOULD HAVE HER BACK ABOUT 9:00." Narrator: BUT WHEN 9:00 P.M. COMES AND GOES WITH NO SIGN OF JADE, TE'JUANA HAS AN UNEASY FEELING. Flanagan-Jones: THERE'S NO ANSWER ON BRENDA'S PHONE. BRENDA'S NOT CALLING BACK. BY 10:00, 11:00 THE NEXT MORNING, I STILL HADN'T HEARD FROM THEM. I STARTED CALLING HOSPITALS. I JUST WAS WORRIED THAT MAYBE THEY HAD AN ACCIDENT. Narrator: WHEN POLICE TELL HER BRENDA STOKES IS IN CUSTODY FOR THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF HER BEST FRIEND, TE'JUANA IS TERRIFIED FOR THE SAFETY OF HER LITTLE GIRL. IT REALLY SHOCKED ME 'CAUSE I HAD NEVER GOTTEN A VIOLENT FEELING FROM BRENDA AT ALL. Narrator: POLICE INTERROGATE BRENDA ABOUT JADE'S WHEREABOUTS. BRENDA SAYS, "I DON'T KNOW A JADE. I DON'T KNOW A TE'JUANA." Reeves: THE ONLY THING BRENDA WOULD SAY TO THE POLICE WAS THAT SHE WAS HAPPY SHE ATTACKED JOYCE AND SHE WAS TRYING TO KILL HER. BUT IF YOU BROUGHT JADE'S NAME UP, SHE WOULD BE QUIET. Narrator: POLICE LAUNCH A MASSIVE SEARCH FOR THE LITTLE GIRL. THEY ALSO DO A BACKGROUND CHECK ON BRENDA AND FIND DISTURBING INFORMATION. IN 1993, BRENDA WAS ARRESTED FOR ATTACKING A BOYFRIEND WITH RAZOR BLADES. Narrator: THIS NEW DISCOVERY RAISES GREAT CONCERN. IMMEDIATELY, POLICE EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANTS ON BRENDA'S HOME AND CAR. WE'RE THINKING SHE'S HIDING OR JUST BEING MEAN TO PHILLIP. BRENDA LIKED JADE AND JADE LIKED BRENDA. BRENDA WOULDN'T HURT JADE. THIS IS HOW MUCH THESE TWO PEOPLE LIKED EACH OTHER. Narrator: BUT TO EVERYONE'S HORROR, POLICE DISCOVER BLOODY CLOTHES IN BRENDA'S HOME AND BLOOD THROUGHOUT HER CAR. THE AGONIZING SEARCH FOR THE MISSING 10-YEAR-OLD GOES ON FOR NEARLY A WEEK. MEANWHILE, BRENDA IS ARRAIGNED ON CHARGES FOR HER ASSAULT AGAINST JOYCE. BUT IN THE COURTROOM, THE FOCUS IS ON JADE. WHERE'S JADE AT? SIT DOWN. WHERE'S JADE? COME ON, MAN. THAT'S FOUL. WHEN PHILLIP GOT UP AND WAS ASKING HER, "WHERE'S MY BABY," IF YOU LOOK AT HER FACE, THERE'S A GOTCHA LOOK ON HER FACE. Narrator: THEN SIX DAYS LATER, TWO DAYS AFTER CHRISTMAS, A WOMAN WALKING HER DOG FINDS THE LITTLE GIRL IN A DESERTED AREA JUST 10 MILES FROM THE MALL WHERE BRENDA SAID SHE WAS TAKING HER SHOPPING. HORRIFICALLY, JADE HAS BEEN STABBED TO DEATH. BRENDA WAS THINKING THE ULTIMATE REVENGE. I THINK HER HATRED OR ANGER FOR PHILLIP JUST TOOK OVER HER WHEN IT CAME TO JADE, AND SHE FIGURED THAT WOULD BE THE THING THAT WOULD HURT HIM THE MOST. Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, ON DECEMBER 28th, DNA RESULTS REVEAL THE BLOODY CLOTHES TAKEN FROM BRENDA'S HOME ARE A MATCH FOR 10-YEAR-OLD JADE. BRENDA STOKES IS CHARGED WITH THE KIDNAPPING AND MURDER OF JADE MORRIS. JADE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PART OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BETWEEN THE ADULTS AT ALL. JADE WAS JUST A LITTLE GIRL WHO WAS SO CRAZY ABOUT BRENDA, AND SHE THOUGHT BRENDA WAS CRAZY ABOUT HER. [ Voice breaking ] I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SHE DID THIS TO MY BABY. I JUST WANT JADE TO BE REMEMBERED AS THE, YOU KNOW, BRIGHT LITTLE GIRL. EVERYONE SHOULD JUST REMEMBER HER UPBEAT LITTLE PERSONALITY AND HER SWEET LITTLE VOICE. Narrator: THOUGH JOYCE'S LIFE WAS SPARED IN THE ATTACK, HER RECOVERY HAS BEEN A SLOW AND ARDUOUS PROCESS. SHE GOT AN EXCELLENT PLASTIC SURGEON WHO SEWED HER FACE BACK TOGETHER, BUT SHE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SURGERY. SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO BACK IN THE BELLAGIO. SHE CANNOT WORK THERE OR ANYWHERE AT THE PRESENT TIME. JOYCE MAINTAINS THERE WAS NEVER AN AFFAIR BETWEEN HER AND PHILLIP. AND FOR JOYCE, RECOVERY IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HER BEST FRIEND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT JUST ONE HEINOUS ACT, BUT TWO. SHE IS EMOTIONALLY TRAUMATIZED, BY NOT JUST THE INCIDENT, BUT BY THE FACT IT WAS A FRIEND WHO DID THIS MAYHEM AND TRIED TO KILL HER. I DON'T THINK ANYONE HERE IN LAS VEGAS KNEW WHAT KIND OF PERSON BRENDA WAS. THEY HAD BEEN BEST FRIENDS FOR SO MANY YEARS. IT'S HARD TO THINK THAT THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO YOU COULD BETRAY YOU LIKE THIS. Narrator: BRENDA STOKES REMAINS IN JAIL AND IS AWAITING TRIAL. OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
