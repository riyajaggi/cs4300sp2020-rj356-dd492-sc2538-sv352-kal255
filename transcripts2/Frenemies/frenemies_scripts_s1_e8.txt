 ALEX IS POPULAR, ATHLETIC, AND BRIGHT. HE WAS THE SMARTEST KID I KNEW -- GREAT IN SCHOOL, GREAT GRADES, A PEOPLE PERSON. IT'S HARD TO FIND A PERSON THAT DIDN'T LIKE HIM. HE WAS ONE OF THE BEST PEOPLE I KNEW. Narrator: DEQUAN IS A FUN-LOVING CLASS CLOWN. Miller: HE WAS A JOKESTER. HE WAS JUST FUNNY -- VERY FUNNY KID. MAKING EVERYBODY LAUGH, DOING SOMETHING GOOFY, BEING THE LIFE OF THE PARTY. HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY, "I LOVE YOU, DAD." HE WASN'T SHY ABOUT SAYING THAT TO ME IN FRONT OF ANYONE. Narrator: THE BOYS GROW UP IN THE SAME LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOOD AND FACE DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES TOGETHER.

 WELL, THEY KIND OF LIVED IN A BAD AREA -- A LOT OF CRIME, A LOT OF DRUGS. Narrator: BUT DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, THE BOYS' FRIENDSHIP GROWS, AND DEQUAN SPENDS MOST OF HIS FREE TIME WITH ALEX. AT ALEX'S HOUSE, DEQUAN BECAME, YOU KNOW, PRETTY CLOSE WITH THE FAMILY. ALEX'S MOTHER -- SHE LIKED DEQUAN A LOT. Gussler: THEY REALLY HAD TAKEN HIM IN. THE WHOLE FAMILY SEEMED CLOSE WITH DEQUAN AND VICE VERSA, AND HE'D HAVE DINNERS THERE AND SLEEP OVER. THEY WAS DEFINITELY BEST FRIENDS. Narrator: BUT THEIR CLOSE FRIENDSHIP IS ABOUT TO BE TESTED. ONE DAY IN THE FALL OF 2006, DEQUAN AND ALEX ARE PLAYING FOOTBALL, EXPECTING ALEX'S BROTHER, NICHOLAS, TO JOIN THEM. BUT WHEN HE DOESN'T APPEAR, ALEX GOES INTO THE HOUSE TO FIND HIM. William Sr.: ALEX WAS CALLING FOR HIM, AND THAT'S WHEN ALEX WENT DOWN AND FOUND HIM. Narrator: TO HIS HORROR, ALEX FINDS HIS 21-YEAR-OLD BROTHER IN THE BASEMENT, DEAD, HANGING FROM A SELF-MADE NOOSE. HIS BROTHER, NICHOLAS, HAD SUFFERED FROM A DEBILITATING DEPRESSION FOR MOST OF HIS LIFE. WELL, NICK HAD SOME PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS, BUT I KNOW ALEX LOOKED UP TO HIM. I KNOW ALEX AND NICK LOVED EACH OTHER. Narrator: THE VISION OF HIS BROTHER'S SUICIDE WILL HAUNT ALEX FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. I GOT A CALL FROM ALEX, CRYING AND BEING ALL CRAZY AND I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM LIKE THAT BEFORE. HE LOVED HIS BROTHER SO MUCH, SO I THINK THAT DESTROYED HIM, Gussler: HIS BROTHER'S SUICIDE WAS A VERY, VERY TRAUMATIC EVENT FOR HIM, AND I THINK THAT HAD A REAL IMPACT. Narrator: DEQUAN IS ALSO DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE SUICIDE. I REMEMBER 'QUAN COMING HOME CRYING AND SAYING THAT ALEX'S BROTHER JUST KILLED HIMSELF. Narrator: DEQUAN TRIES TO HELP HIS BEST FRIEND THROUGH THE TRAGEDY AS BEST HE CAN. DEQUAN WAS A PALLBEARER AND HELPED ALEX PUT NICHOLAS IN THE GROUND, SO THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DEAL -- SOMEBODY ASKS YOU TO DO THAT. I DEFINITELY THINK IT BROUGHT THEM CLOSER. ONE OF YOUR BUDDIES GOES THROUGH A HARD TIME, YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE AND SUPPORT HIM, AND THAT'S WHAT 'QUAN DID. Narrator: BUT EVEN DEQUAN'S HEARTFELT ATTEMPTS TO COMFORT HIS FRIEND ARE NOT ENOUGH TO SOFTEN ALEX'S DEVASTATION. ALEX WENT FROM BEING SO HAPPY TO JUST CONSTANTLY BEING SAD. HE STARTED SUFFERING FROM NIGHTMARES. HE SAID HE ALWAYS SAW HIS BROTHER IN ALL HIS DREAMS. I THINK THAT'S WHEN ALEX'S LIFE CHANGED FOR THE WORSE. Gussler: ALEX BEGAN SELF-MEDICATING. HE BECAME KIND OF SWALLOWED UP BY THE STREETS AND BEGAN ABUSING DRUGS AND ALCOHOL PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY TO KIND OF NUMB THE PAIN. Narrator: CONSUMED BY HIS GRIEF, ALEX BEGINS TO MAKE A SERIES OF BAD CHOICES. Day: ALEX STARTED HANGING OUT WITH PEOPLE THAT HE HAD NO BUSINESS HANGING OUT WITH. EXCESSIVE DRINKING, EXCESSIVE DRUG USE, HE STOPPED GOING TO SCHOOL. THERE WAS SOME ANGER STORED UP IN HIM, AND HE WAS MAKING A BAD CHANGE. Narrator: ONLY A FEW MONTHS LATER, DEQUAN ALSO GOES THROUGH A ROUGH TIME WHEN HIS PARENTS SEPARATE. HE DROPS OUT OF SCHOOL AND STARTS SPENDING MORE TIME ON THE STREETS. HANGING WITH THE WRONG CROWD, BEING IN THE WRONG PLACE AT THE WRONG TIME. Day: JUST GETTING INTO BAD THINGS. LIVING HARD, THOUGH -- LIVING LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. THE BOYS HAD TURNED TO DRUGS AND ALCOHOL. THEY'RE MAKING DUMB DECISIONS. Narrator: BOTH YOUNG MEN ARE HEADED DOWN A PERILOUS PATH -- ONE THAT WILL SOON THREATEN THEIR FRIENDSHIP. WHEN ALEX'S MOM REALIZES THAT HER SON IS DOING DRUGS, SHE BLAMES IT ON DEQUAN AND TELLS HIM HE'S NOT TO COME AROUND THEIR HOUSE ANYMORE. YOU'RE NO LONGER WELCOME AT MY HOUSE. WHAT -- WHAT DID I DO?'QUAN WAS SHOCKED, ANGRY. Narrator: IT DRIVES A WEDGE BETWEEN THE TWO CLOSE FRIENDS. THEY ALWAYS SEEMED CORDIAL WITH EACH OTHER, BUT THEY WEREN'T REALLY THAT GOOD OF BUDDIES AFTER THAT. Narrator: A FEW WEEKS LATER, IN AUGUST 2009, SOMEONE BREAKS INTO ALEX'S HOUSE AND STEALS HIS MOTHER'S JEWELRY. ALEX WAS DEFINITELY PISSED -- I WOULD HAVE BEEN, ANY PERSON WOULD HAVE BEEN. Narrator: AND EVEN MORE SHOCKING, RUMOR HAS IT THAT HIS FRIEND DEQUAN DID IT TO GET BACK AT ALEX FOR BEING THROWN OUT OF HIS HOUSE. ALEX WAS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. I'M SURE HE KNEW WHERE ALEX'S PARENTS KEPT SOME VALUABLE THINGS, AND I THINK HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT. Narrator: BUT DEQUAN DENIES HE HAD ANY INVOLVEMENT IN THE ROBBERY. DEQUAN ACTUALLY TOLD ME THAT HE DIDN'T BREAK INTO ALEX'S HOUSE. HE SAID IT WASN'T TRUE. Narrator: LITTLE DOES ANYONE KNOW THE ROBBERY IS JUST THE FIRST STEP OF WHAT WILL ESCALATE INTO A DEADLY VENDETTA. THAT THIS YOUNG MAN WOULD BETRAY HIM WAS OVERWHELMING TO HIM. Day: I WAS SHOCKED. I KNOW WHAT HE DID WILL NEVER, NEVER BE FORGOTTEN. Narrator: 18-YEAR-OLD ALEX IS FURIOUS. HE BELIEVES THAT HIS GOOD FRIEND, DEQUAN, WAS BEHIND THE ROBBERY OF HIS PARENTS' HOME. Gussler: PEOPLE STARTED COMING TO HIM AND SAYING, "WE'VE GOT IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY THAT IT WAS DEQUAN THAT COMMITTED THE BURGLARY." Day: THIS IS SOMEBODY THAT HELPED YOU BURY YOUR BROTHER, HUGGED YOU AT THE FUNERAL AND SAID HE LOVES YOU AND THEN DID THAT TO YOU. HE FELT BETRAYED. Narrator: BUT DEQUAN VEHEMENTLY DENIES THAT HE HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE ROBBERY. William Jr.: WELL, I BELIEVED HIM. I DIDN'T ASK HIM NO MORE QUESTIONS. Narrator: DESPITE ALEX'S FEELINGS OF BETRAYAL AND ANGER, HE DOESN'T CALL THE POLICE. THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF COLUMBUS HAD DEVELOPED THEIR OWN RULES. AND ONE OF THOSE RULES WAS THAT YOU DON'T CALL THE POLICE. IT'S NOT THE WAY THEY DO IT. THEY SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS WITH THEIR FISTS. Narrator: AND A FEW DAYS LATER, ALEX ANGRILY CONFRONTS DEQUAN. ALEX HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM. AND I GUESS THEY GOT INTO A FIGHT. Narrator: ANGRY WORDS QUICKLY ESCALATE INTO VIOLENCE. IT WASN'T ME. I DON'T KNOW WHO -- THE BOTH GOT PUNCHED IN THE FACE. I KNOW IT WAS YOU! GET OUT OF HERE! Narrator: A FURIOUS ALEX WALKS OFF, AND THE BOYS GO THEIR SEPARATE WAYS. DESPITE FEELING ANGRY AND BETRAYED, HE DOESN'T PRESS CHARGES, BUT THEIR FRIENDSHIP OF FOUR YEARS IS OVER. HE LOST TRUST IN SOMEBODY THAT HE PUT TRUST IN. HE BETRAYED HIM. AND YOU LOSE ALEX'S TRUST ONCE, YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT BACK. HE TURNED INTO ONE OF ALEX'S ENEMIES AFTER THAT. Narrator: AND DEQUAN IS ANGRY THAT ALEX BELIEVES HE COMMITTED THE ROBBERY. HE WAS JUST LIKE, "I DIDN'T DO IT, AND, YOU KNOW, IF I GOT TO DEFEND MYSELF, I'M GONNA DEFEND MYSELF." HE JUST WANTED TO JUST END THE FRIENDSHIP. Narrator: NOW ON HIS OWN, DEQUAN DECIDES IT'S TIME TO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND AND GOES BACK TO SCHOOL. HE WAS TIRED -- TIRED OF RUNNING THE STREETS, HANGING OUT. HE ACTUALLY SAID TO ME, "I NEED TO DO SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, WITH MY LIFE, BECAUSE I'M 18 YEARS OLD, AND, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST TIRED." William Jr.: HE WANTED BETTER FOR HIMSELF. HE STARTED THINKING ABOUT, "WHAT AM I GONNA BE LATER ON?" "WHAT DO I WANT TO DO?" HE JUST TOLD ME -- HE SAID, "WELL, AUNT LU, I'VE BEEN CALLING DIFFERENT PLACES TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE I CAN GO AND GET MY G.E.D." HE WANTED TO GO TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AT THAT TIME, HE WAS PRETTY MUCH TRYING TO FIND HIMSELF INSTEAD OF JUST RUNNING AROUND WILD AND LOOSE. Narrator: MEANWHILE, ALEX'S LIFE CONTINUES TO SPIRAL DOWNWARD, AND HE BECOMES EVEN MORE WITHDRAWN. ALEX NEVER KNEW WHAT IT REALLY FELT LIKE TO BE DEPRESSED. I THINK THAT HIT HIM HARD, AND IT WAS A LOT FOR HIM TO TAKE IN AT THE TIME. Narrator: ALEX CAN'T SEEM TO GET OVER THE SENSE OF BETRAYAL BY HIS FORMER BEST FRIEND AND IS HARBORING A DEEP-SEATED GRUDGE. IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED, IT FESTERED. HE WOULD ALTERNATE BETWEEN LETTING IT GO AND THEN ALL OF THOSE FEELINGS OF BETRAYAL WOULD COME OUT. Narrator: A YEAR AFTER THE ROBBERY, IN SEPTEMBER 2010, 19-YEAR-OLD ALEX AND HIS FRIEND ARE AT A CONVENIENCE STORE WHEN THEY RUN INTO DEQUAN, UNEXPECTEDLY, IN THE PARKING LOT. 'QUAN PULLED UP ON HIS BICYCLE, BUT ALEX DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO 'QUAN. Narrator: DEQUAN ISN'T SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF THE ENCOUNTER. HE TOLD ME HE HAD SEEN ALEX, AND HE SAID SOMETHING DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT. HE SAID, "DAD, WHEN THEY SAW ME, THEY LOOKED SPOOKED. THEY LOOKED SHOCKED TO SEE ME." HE SAID, "THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME." AND HE SAID, "THEY JUST LEFT." Narrator: IN FACT, THE ENCOUNTER DEEPLY AFFECTS ALEX. HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO BURY THE HATCHET AND MAKE UP WITH DEQUAN. WHEN ALEX WANTS TO DO SOMETHING, HE WANTS TO DO IT. Narrator: BUT NO ONE COULD ANTICIPATE WHAT WILL COME OF ALEX'S INTENTIONS. ALL OF THOSE FEELINGS OF BETRAYAL WOULD FESTER BACK UP. IT WAS A PERFECT STORM. I WOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT COMING. THREW ME OFF 100%. IT WAS THE WORST DAY THAT I EVER, EVER, EVER HAD. Narrator: AFTER UNEXPECTEDLY RUNNING INTO HIS FORMER BEST FRIEND IN A PARKING LOT, ALEX TELLS FRIENDS HE WANTS TO GO TO DEQUAN'S PLACE TO SORT OUT THEIR DIFFERENCES LATER THAT NIGHT. THE TWO HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN MORE THAN A YEAR. I DIDN'T THINK GOING TO 'QUAN'S HOUSE WAS A GOOD IDEA AT ALL JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR PAST. Narrator: BEFORE HE GOES TO DEQUAN'S, ALEX BEGINS TO DRINK HEAVILY, MIXING ALCOHOL WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. Day: AND HE WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE, SO I RESPECTED HIM AND LEFT HIM ALONE, YOU KNOW? Narrator: HIS FRIEND FALLS ASLEEP ON THE COUCH WHILE ALEX CONTINUES DRINKING. EVEN THOUGH ALEX CLAIMS HE WANTS TO RECONCILE WITH DEQUAN, AS HE BECOMES MORE AND MORE INTOXICATED, HIS MOOD BEGINS TO CHANGE. ALEX WAS PACING BACK AND FORTH. IT WOKE ME UP OFF MY COUCH. HE HAD THE LOOK LIKE -- HE JUST LOOKED KIND OF STRESSED OUT, AND I ASKED HIM IF HE WAS ALL RIGHT, AND HE SAID HE NEEDED A MINUTE. I JUST REMEMBER HIM COVERED IN SWEAT. AND THEN I SAW SOMETHING CHANGED IN HIS FACE, AND THEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, ALEX JUST GRABBED HIS PACK OF CIGARETTES, LEFT, DIDN'T SAY A WORD TO ME. HE WAS GONE. Narrator: ALEX LEAVES THE HOUSE AROUND MIDNIGHT. AND WHEN AN HOUR PASSES, HIS FRIEND BECOMES CONCERNED AND TRIES TO CONTACT HIM. I CALLED HIM, LEFT HIM MESSAGES, SENT HIM TEXT MESSAGES, TRYING TO HUNT HIM DOWN. I, PERSONALLY, THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA HURT HIMSELF LIKE HIS BROTHER WHO HAD COMMITTED SUICIDE. THAT'S WHAT I WAS TERRIFIED OF. Narrator: MEANWHILE, DEQUAN IS AT HOME RELAXING. HIS FATHER TEXTS HIM, LETTING HIM KNOW THAT HE IS COMING HOME WITH PIZZA. AND HE TEXTS ME BACK, "COOL" WITH A SMILEY FACE. AND THEN HE WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, DAD. I LOVE YOU." I TEXTED HIM BACK, "I LOVE YOU, TOO," LIKE WE ALWAYS DO. Narrator: DEQUAN WAITS FOR HIS DAD OUTSIDE, BUT HE IS SURPRISED WHEN ALEX SUDDENLY SHOWS UP. Day: IT WAS JUST QUAN AND ALEX, AND THEY WERE TALKING, AND IT WAS REALLY LATE. Narrator: ALEX TELLS DEQUAN HE WANTS TO PUT THE PAST BEHIND HIM. Day: THEY TALKED FACE TO FACE, YOU KNOW, SHOOK HANDS AND EVERYTHING. THOUGHT THEY WERE GONNA BECOME FRIENDS AGAIN. Narrator: THEN ALEX ASKED DEQUAN IF HE WANTS TO SMOKE SOME POT, AND, RELIEVED TO GET THEIR FRIENDSHIP BACK ON TRACK, DEQUAN AGREES. AND ALEX WAS LIKE, "WELL, I GOT SOME ON ME, "YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T WANT TO BE IN FRONT OF THE APARTMENT, "'CAUSE I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO SEE US. I DON'T WANT TO GET IN ANY TROUBLE." DEQUAN WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, COOL. LET'S GO TO THE BACK." Narrator: THE TWO YOUNG MEN HEAD TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE BUILDING, BUT NOTHING GOES AS PLANNED. 'CAUSE THEY WERE FRIENDS, AND THEY WERE REALLY CLOSE, I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING. IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING. Narrator: ALEX SHOWS UP AT HIS BEST FRIEND'S HOUSE AND CLAIMS HE WANTS TO MAKE AMENDS. AS A PEACE OFFERING, HE INVITES DEQUAN TO THE BACK OF THE BUILDING TO GET HIGH. 'QUAN WAS LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, COOL. LET'S GO TO THE BACK." Narrator: BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO DEQUAN, ALEX HAS AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AGENDA. ALEX DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COPE. IT WAS EATING AWAY AT HIM. ALEX JUST COULDN'T GET BEYOND THAT BURGLARY. Narrator: AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY TO THE BACK OF THE BUILDING, SOMETHING SHOCKING OCCURS. INSTEAD OF TAKING DRUGS OUT OF HIS POCKET, ALEX SUDDENLY PULLS OUT A GUN. I DON'T THINK 'QUAN EVEN SAW THE GUN. I DON'T EVEN THINK 'QUAN HAD TIME TO REACT TO SEEING A GUN. Narrator: WITHOUT ANY WARNING, ALEX FIRES. HE SHOT HIM TWICE, EXECUTION STYLE. Narrator: NEIGHBORS HEAR THE GUNSHOTS AND CALL 911. Dispatcher: 911, WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY? Man: I HEARD TWO GUNSHOTS OUTSIDE MY APARTMENT. I LOOKED, AND I SAW THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN LAYING OUT AT THE SIDE OF MY APARTMENT. DID YOU SEE WHO FIRED THE SHOT? NO, SIR. ALL RIGHT. WE'LL GET SOMEBODY OUT THERE. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: PARAMEDICS ARRIVE AND RUSH DEQUAN TO THE HOSPITAL. ONCE THERE, THEY IMMEDIATELY CALL HIS FATHER. HE SAYS, "SOMEBODY SHOT DEQUAN." HE SAID, "MAN, HE GOT SHOT IN THE HEAD." AND THAT'S WHEN I KIND OF LOST IT. YOU KNOW, I WAS PRETTY HYSTERICAL. AND I JUST REMEMBER MY DAD CRYING. IT WAS HARD FOR HIM TO SAY IT. HE TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED, AND WE FLEW TO THE HOSPITAL. HE FOUGHT AND FOUGHT AND FOUGHT TILL EARLY THAT MORNING. WHEN THEY TOOK HIM OFF OF LIFE SUPPORT, HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO. Narrator: EIGHT HOURS LATER, DEQUAN LOSES HIS STRUGGLE TO SURVIVE AND DIES. MEANWHILE, A DISHEVELED AND FRANTIC ALEX ARRIVES BACK HOME. Day: I JUST REMEMBER ALEX COMING IN SHIRTLESS, PANTING 'CAUSE HE RAN ALL THE WAY BACK HOME. Narrator: BUT HE'S EVEN MORE STUNNED WHEN ALEX MAKES A HORRIFYING CONFESSION. Day: HE JUST SAT DOWN AND SAID, "DUDE, I DID SOMETHING STUPID." HE TOLD ME HE KILLED HIM. "KILLED HIM." THAT'S ALL HE KEPT SAYING. I SHOT HIM. HE JUST SAID HE PULLED THE GUN OUT AND SHOT HIM. I DON'T THINK HE WAS THINKING WHEN HE DID IT. HE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE, WHICH IS NEVER AN EXCUSE, BUT HE WAS. HE WASN'T COMPLETELY HIMSELF. HE JUST LOOKED CRAZY. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EVER DISPUTED THE FACT THAT THE SUICIDE OF HIS BROTHER HAD AFFECTED HIS MENTAL HEALTH. Day: THE BUILD UP OF EVERYTHING -- I JUST THINK IT GOT TO BE TOO MUCH FOR HIM AND HE LOST CONTROL. I REALLY THOUGHT THAT ALEX FORGAVE HIM. Narrator: AUTHORITIES IMMEDIATELY LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION. THEY START BY QUESTIONING NEIGHBORS WHO TELL POLICE THEY SAW ALEX OUTSIDE DEQUAN'S HOME JUST BEFORE THE MURDER. Day: SOMEHOW, WORD TRAVELED AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY KNEW ALEX AND 'QUAN HAD A BEEF, AND SO THEY IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT IT WAS ALEX RIGHT OFF THE BAT. [ SIREN WAILS ] Narrator: THE NEXT DAY, 19-YEAR-OLD ALEX COVER IS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF HIS ONE-TIME BEST FRIEND, DEQUAN CARTER. A YEAR AFTER THE MURDER, ALEX PLEADS GUILTY TO KILLING HIS FRIEND. CHARGED WITH INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER, HE IS ORDERED TO UNDERGO TREATMENT FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER DUE TO HIS BROTHER'S SUICIDE. HE IS SENTENCED TO 18 YEARS IN PRISON. AND HE JUST KEPT SAYING SORRY FOR WHAT HE DID AND WAS SAD -- JUST KIND OF TEARING UP. IT FINALLY HIT HIM. I GO, "OH, BOY." "HE'S GOING TO JAIL FOR A LONG TIME." Narrator: ALEX APOLOGIZES IN COURT FOR ENDING THE LIFE OF HIS FRIEND WHO WAS ONCE AS CLOSE AS HIS OWN BROTHER. I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID. I REGRET IT VERY, VERY MUCH. Narrator: ALEX'S MOTHER, NANCI, ALSO MAKES A HEARTFELT STATEMENT TO DEQUAN'S FAMILY IN THE COURTROOM. [ Crying ] I'M TERRIBLY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. ALEX AND 'QUAN WERE BEST FRIENDS. 'QUAN SPENT HUNDREDS OF NIGHTS AT MY HOUSE. HE WAS A SWEET KID. Narrator: BUT THE APOLOGIES CAN'T BRING DEQUAN BACK OR EASE THE PAIN OF SO MANY AFFECTED BY THE TRAGEDY. HE DESTROYED TWO FAMILIES, BECAUSE HE DESTROYED OUR FAMILY BY TAKING DEQUAN, BUT HE ALSO DESTROYED HIS FAMILY, 'CAUSE NOW HIS MOTHER HAS A SON THAT'S TAKEN AWAY FROM HER AND INCARCERATED NOW. William Jr.: WHEN I JUST THINK ABOUT 'QUAN, I JUST -- IT'S LIKE A PIECE OF MY LIFE IS MISSING. IT WAS A BOND BETWEEN ME, DEQUAN, AND MY DAD THAT I WILL NEVER HAVE WITH NOBODY ELSE EVER. AND I JUST CAN'T GET THAT BACK. Narrator: IT'S STILL A STRUGGLE FOR DEQUAN'S FAMILY TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR SON'S BEST FRIEND COULD HAVE TURNED ON HIM SO VIOLENTLY. William Sr.: BECAUSE THEY WERE FRIENDS, AND THEY WERE REALLY CLOSE, I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED ANYTHING LIKE THAT HAPPENING. William Jr.: DEQUAN REALLY BELIEVED IN HIS HEART LIKE, "YEAH, THAT'S MY FRIEND." ALEX WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST PERSON I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT TO KILL MY BROTHER.
