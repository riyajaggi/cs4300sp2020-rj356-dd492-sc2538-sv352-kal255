 I'm just asking to spend a little more time with him. Is that unreasonable? Would you stop whining? But why can't I join your book club? You thought Nabokov played left-back for Chelsea. Well, I was joking. I thought you're being a little unfair, Marcus. Philip would have known the answer. Really don't want to hear about Philip. No offense, Philip. Don't worry about me, bro.

 Are you sure everything's alright, Philip? Why do you ask? You do seem a little tense. - You're embarrassing yourself, Philip. - You're not the boss of me. What's the matter with you two? - Nothing. - Private. Alright then. - She keeps me out of bedroom. - Philip! - It's been two weeks. - What did you do? I just said she reminded me slightly, slightly of Noel Edmonds. Yeah. No, she hates that. - Yeah, but I like Noel Edmonds. - We're not talking about this here. I mean can you imagine what it's like to, you know, go without for two whole weeks?

 - Yeah. - No. But I can't take it anymore. - I'm a very sexual person. - Wow, thanks for that. Please take me back, my love! Really don't think this is the place, Philip. - This is exactly the place. - Really? There's nothing more natural than talking about sex. - Not in front of a child, though. - Especially in front of a child. No. You know what? You want to play? Fine. Let's play, because as of now I am rejecting you. So how do you like them apples? Boom! No. Yeah, way to go, Philip! Yeah! And Marcus, as for you and your lousy book club, I don't even want to... No, I do. I really do. I want to join, please. Can I? You can join when you demonstrate you've learned something. Alright. How hard can that be? Who wrote "Bleak House?" I want to say Snow Patrol? Spy 01x04 Codename Book Club - Tim Elliott. - Identified. Useless. The lie detector. An invaluable tool for interrogation. You have seen in your textbooks that for the most accurate results you want to keep your subject absolutely calm and relaxed. I disagree! So what is your name? Mo-Mo-Moritz Skink. I don't think so. Let's try that again, shall we? Come on, please? - Please? - Ssshh! Please. What does that even mean, teach me culture? You know books and art, and books. And why would I want to do that? Because you're intelligent and kind. Uh-hum. And I cover all your overtime. Go on. And it would be your chance to have complete control over another human being. You'd be like my Eliza Doolittle. Right, like I'd be able to talk to animals. Come on then, I'll do it. - Yes! - Yes! He gets it. So, once gain. What is the cube root of 216? Six! - No! - It is! You're lying.

Marcus, where is the rooter? Marcus? Whoa! Hey, Phil! Marcus! - Are you ready for this? - Yeah. It does seem a bit... - What? - very not fun. Oh, just give it a chance, you might enjoy it. Yeah. I'll give it a try. I don't think you're going to need that. No? Not really that kind of event. Yeah, I just. - Drink? - Yeah, it'd be great. You've got to send them home, right now! I'm still your headmaster, I cannot be associated with this! I thought we could just take a moment. Hey, now. Don't you try to sweet talk me. As if I would disrespect you like that. - I'm hurt. - Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I just wanted to check in. See how you're doing. How are things between you and Judith? - Much the same. - Must be frustrating. Oh it's, doing okay. You're strong, that's why I admire you. I love her so much. Let it out big guy. You'll get about. Do you think so, really? Hey, Hey! Who can resist this face, huh? Now do you have a smile for me? Who am I like? Oh here's a thought. Oh, no. No, forget it. What? No, no, you wouldn't be interested. Marcus, tell me what is it. I'm not interested in the tears, princess. I want fair and square, and you know it. Now hand over the chips. Caching. Everyone, your attention, please! I would like you to welcome our newest platinum member. Hello! I'm Philip. We use code names, dude! What would you like to be called? - Are you sure? - Hell yeah! Everyone, Cheetara. Nice. That's enough. Welcome to book club, Cheetara! The first rule of book club is? You do not talk about book club. No! - That would be ridiculous. - How would you get people to join? - That's commercial suicide. - Basic marketing. I'm so embarrassed right now. I'm sorry, Marcus. - There go the code names. - Oh, come on! What is wrong with you today? I'm sorry. It's just so much pressure. Okay, people! Let's make some money. You and me, let's go! Sirens crack with a liquid spleen, ash-burned bones velvet the unctuous chasm. his heart elliptical yet complete, empties a wash with furious glee while alone she weeps a tearless soliloquy. Thanks. - Wasn't that incredible? - Yeah, oh yeah! Very moving. - Oh! I saw you. - What? - Eyes closed. - Right. - Listening hard. - Yeah, exactly! Listening, with, with the ears. Listen I really want to thank you for bringing me tonight. I had a great time. Me too. What was... - I should probably get going. - Yeah, good plan. I'm sure Marcus is probably wondering wonder where you are. Wouldn't bet on it. You sure you okay getting home on your own? I'm carrying a Snubnose 9mm, so yeah, I like my chances. Uh hum, yep. Alright. Good night! Good night! Yeah. - See you at work! - Yeah, at work. Excellent. Hello? Philip? Marcus? And that basically is quadratic equations. Hi, Tim! - Is everything okay? - Marcus here, good as gold. - How was the poetry night? - Fantastic. - What? - Loved it. You just give me a few more days and I'm going to be ready to join book club. Yeah well, let's not be too hasty. Takes more than a few days to become a literate. Yeah, how long? - It's hard to say. - Yeah, could be a while. Okay. Tim! - Tim! - Hmm? Check it out. My diner look... Must everything in your world be so base? - Oh, what's your problem? - No problem. It's called being cultured. Ah, yes. Your literally dates with Caitlin. - They're not dates. - They're dates. No. We go out, we listen to poetry, we go home - alone. I didn't say they were good dates. See I'm not like you, Chris. I'm just interested in the learning. - Oh right, so you don't like her? - Of course I like her. Right, but you don't fancy her. Sure, she's pretty. Specially when she does that thing, when she smiles, that's really nice. But you wouldn't be sad if she, I don't know canceled one of your evenings? No, might be a little disappointed, but certainly not sad. Good to know, 'cos she did cancel. What? Why? She never s... - There's nothing on that. - Ahh! You do like her. Oh my god, I really do. - How long have you known this? - For a quite while, now. I want to know everything. - How long have I been feeling this way? - Pretty much from the start. Are you saying that I'm in love with her? - Maybe. - This is huge, dude. Well Tim, luckily for you you happen to know the number one love guru in the district. Yeah, I can't bother Mr. Prokesch again. - I meant me! - No! Yeah! I'm... Go on. Okay, well the trick is you've got to play it very cool. Very enigmatic. Think I know how to be cool. Thank you very much. Alright, well let's see what've you got, big guy. You look like you've had a stroke. Copy me. Come on. - Come on! - Coming. Repeat after me. You don't care! I don't care! You score a new chick every day of the week. - I score a... well, I don't. - She doesn't know that. Kind of does. - Tim! - Okay! - You're a player! - I'm a player! - You're a ladies' man! - I'm a ladies' man! - You're a prat! - I'm a... Hey, Marcus! - How long have you been there? - Long enough. We were just, um practicing a ancient African ritual. I'm surprised you haven't seen it before. - Leaving in five minutes. - Five minutes, check! Look at me, look at me. Tim, tonight you are going to unleash the Tim-tornado. You're feelin' it. You have disappointed me, Allan. I swear I never said anything to anyone. Haven't I looked after you? Of course, Marcus! I owe you everything. I'd never do anything to hurt you. And why didn't Mrs. Godfree appoint me chess captain? I don't know. You have to believe me. I know it was you, Allan. You broke my heart. I don't want anything to happen to him while Miley Cyrus is alive. Yes? We've been going through the accounts. - Just give me the headlines. - Turnover up 67%. - Memberships? - Stable. What about profits? The profit margin isn't quite what we wanted to be. I asked you about the profits! We made a loss. Turnover's up and we make a loss? There were some unexpected write-offs. What are you telling me? For god's sakes it's Philip, you've given him his credit lines. - Paul, don't. - No Daniel, he's got to know. Philip is massively in debt to the house and can't pare off. I've let my heart cloud my judgement. I'll deal with this personally. You've been seeing a lot of Kathy recently. - Caitlin. - Ugly name. - It means unfaithful. - No, it doesn't. Slutty, or slut-like. - Did you want something? - You do know she's a lesbian? - She's not a lesbian. - She could be a lesbian. You could be a lesbian. No, but you might as well stop hanging around if she's not interested. Well, I will find out soon enough. - What does that mean? - Nothing. We'll see about that. Morning! Sure. - You alright? - Ah, yeah. If you need to pigeonhole me, I am alright. - Tim? - Shoot! - Have you soiled yourself? - No, that's how men walk. Incontinent men, maybe. More importantly, what is the dealio with tonight's activités? I've planned something a bit special actually. Oh, yeah? Yeah, it's going to be at my house, if that's okay. That is perfection. But I should warn you, there may be some nudity. Nudity? Don't worry, I think you man enough for it. I think I'm man. Tim, - a word. - Yeah. See you later! Tim, I want to know what's going on between you and Caitlin. No, what're you talking about? Tim, came on! Do you think I'm a fool? Well... no! No way! I mean you know the policy on interoffice romance. - Forbidden. - Forbidden? 'course it's not forbidden. God no, why would it be forbidden? Because some people feel interoffice relationships can alienate other members of staff, not to mention the increased risk of blackmail, which could potentially endanger the safety of the government, the monarchy and the entire British population? - Twaddle. - Right. Come on, god where you supposed to hook up with someone if it's not at work? I mean sure, you can hang around rehab clinics, but... - is that really acceptable? - No. Well, probably, but what would I now? What do you think? Spit it out, lad, come on. I agree with everything you say. Good answer, well done. Okay, Tim. You have my blessing. Thank you, Sir. I just ask that you let me watch. You're joking. Yeah, I can see how would that sound more appropriate. Is he okay, do we think? He's fine. But he is a fire hazard. It's okay. - I'm really not sure about this. - Would you please, just trust me? - Okay, you are early. - Yeah. Okay, bye then! Whoah, no hold on, hold on. I've left you food in the fridge. Yeah. And my mobile number is on the side! Fine, good-bye! - What're you doing? - We have orders not to let you in. What? Since when? - Evening fellas! Good evening, Sir! See? Right, Marcus? Marc-Marcus! Marcus! Marcus! Tell your boys to let me in. No can do Cheetara, I'm cutting you off. Please! Just, just one more night. I need you to follow these gentlemen now. What? No! No! - How can I ever repay you? - I'll think of something. Hi. Hello! Are you coming in? I don't know. Am I? Yes? Do you want me to take your... Oh, my! You like? Are those your nipples? We'll just keep that our little secret, shall we? We can try. Everyone, this is Tim. - Hi, Tim! - Hello, Tim! Tim, this is my life-study class. Hi. No more bets. Looks like business is doing well. Just giving the people what they want. People want a lot of things that aren't necessarily good for them. - I'm not here to judge. - Just exploit? - Thank you for dropping by. - I want to play! - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. I want to play you. - What do you want to play? - 21? - Your bet? - I don't have any money. - In that case then... - So I'll just bet this. - Is that a problem? - I gave that to you. But you'll accept it, right? Stick or twist? I'll stick. - Did she just stick on 14? - I know. Statistically Marcus almost can't lose. I'll twist. He's got her now. It's all over. - Passed. - What? - Bad luck. - It happens. Oh, and don't forget that. We should set up a rematch sometime. I'm thinking of retiring, actually. That sounds like smart move. I'll see you around. I don't understand how you lost. What cards did you have? I forget. That was a bad beat, Marcus. Sometimes you have to lose in order to win. I'm serious. Martha, not going to tell you again. - Just ignore her. - She's freaking me out. It is a funny thing. When you were talking of here, about there being some nudity, I thought you meant... - Me? - You. - Naked? - I know. - Get out of here. - I wish I could. What bit of what I said made you think that? Umm, the words? Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Tim. Well, I'm not disappointed, Caitlin. I mean who wants to see us naked? - Put your hand down, Martha! - Put your hand down, Martha! Hold on, if it isn't you getting naked, than who... Oh, no! I have studied poetry, sculpture, architecture, and now the painting of the semi-human form. In the name of all that is holy, please can I join the book club? Tim? You can join the book club. - Really? - Really. Well this is a huge honor. Thank you. Congratulations. Here. What is this? My official appointment to the club? Not exactly. It's formal notice that the book club has, as of 7 o'clock this evening been dissolved. Dissolved? Sorry about that. Though break. - I need to be alone for a while. - I understand. Don't you think that was just a little mean? He's fine. He enjoys it, really. What would've been mean is if I had admitted to tell him... - Oh, God! - Get out! By the way, Philip and Judith are up there! - Yes, thanks! - Hey buddy! Get, hey! No, no! Don't leave on my account!
