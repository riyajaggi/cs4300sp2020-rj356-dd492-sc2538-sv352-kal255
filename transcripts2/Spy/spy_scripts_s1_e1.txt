Alright, now there's an assesment day tomorrow at 12:00 so I'll just print off your forms and you are good to go. Alrighty. I feel like this is going to be the start of great things for you, Tim. Hey! Good jog? Are you ready for your interview? Yeah, I think so. Do you want to practice some questions? Nope. I think I'm okay. Why do you think you're suited to this position? - Well... - Too slow! On a scale of 4 to 60, do you prefer failure or defeat? Don't understand. - Really? - No. - 47? - What? - No? - No. - Okay, pretty basic stuff. - Yeah. I'm pretty sure that they going to stick to questions about my CV. - Just the one sheet? - Yeah.

Sorry! - What's your name? - Tim Elliott. Well done, Tim. Well done. Be back at 2 pm, for the interview. Okay. - I'll just get it later. - Yeah, good idea. Good luck! I think it went okay. Well you'd be sure to tell them for me, that the civil service is nothing but a pimp to this fascist puppet government, and I count off the days till we see their survival heads rolling in the streets. Yeah. Yeah, I'll definitely do that. - Alright, cool. - Alrighty. You going to need a new one. Do you mind? Well, I was sitting here first. No, I meant with you. Sit with you. Oh, you it's alright. I thought you meant you wanted me to... Do you mind? Sorry, no. Yeah, go ahead. We haven't met probably. I'm Caitlin. I'm Tim. - Sausage? - No, thanks. - They're pork. - I'm fine. It's like *** It says 87% meat. You finished the test very quickly. There's definitely pork in there. I mean I found it pretty easy as well. And beef?

Are you wearing a wire? What? No, I'm not, no. My son just say that they only hire ugly people in the civil service, so that would count you out. Oh. Right. - Sorry about that. - It's fine. God I want this job! Sorry. Don't worry about it. There're lots of other jobs out there. There's one at Playboy right now, if you're interested. Excuse me?

Yeah. - Good luck this afternoon! - You too! You sure you...? *** Yes... - Damn impressive exam results, Tim. - Thank you. Hope we not appear to have any paperwork on you. No, job centre should've sent that over. Discrete, I like that. So, any questions for us? Um... Do you do dental cover? You know, for the teeth? He's... You are one cool guy, Tim. Really? - Smoking cool. - Okay. But I bet you hear that all the time. Not as often as you think. Tim, we err... we'd like to offer you a job. Wow, brilliant. Okay, thanks! Good. He is one cool guy. He's good, huh? - And that is? - Yeah, I know. It's standard issue Glock 17 I'm affraid. But hey, you're free to supplement it as you see fit. Personally I prefer these babies. Right. Good. - What? Everything okay? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. Actually one thing. Will I be needing that a lot, do you think? - What's your meaning? - For the data processing? Not really your tea bag. Pr... processing the data? - Woah! - Woah! Woah! - Woah! - Hey! It's okay, nice and easy. That's it, just slide it across. You see that I am fully conversant in PowerPoint and Excel, and I do speak intermediate Spanish. Tim, would you just go outside for a moment? - Should I take? - Not just yet. Well, Tim. Clearly there has been some kind of mix-up. Oh dear! Now I have to inform you that everything that you have seen today falls strictly within the official secrets act, and its breach will result in life in prisonment. - Do you understand? - Yes. Yes. You have put us in a very awkward position. But luckily for you, I like awkward positions. Always have. You read me? - No. - Terrific. Now Tim, you've demonstrated skills today that we can definitely use. So what do you say, pal? You want a job? - What? Doing what? - What do you think? As an agent in her majesty's secret intelligent service. Shut up! No, rea... Any questions? - Um, what does the job involve? - That's classified. - Do I get to stay in London? - Classified. But I'd be working for you? No, I got it! - Classified. - No it isn't. - No? Okay. - No, only kidding. That really is classified. I... could I think about it? No. Not a way around. But Tim, if you do accept this job, your world will never be the same again. People's lives will depend on you. Is that fun? Of course it is But it's also a burden. A burden that you cannot share with anyone. And I mean anyone. Well? What do you say? You did well today, Caitlin. Welcome aboard! Lovely! - It's so beautiful. - What are you wearing? I was just catching some rays. - Have you shot it yet? - No. - Can we shoot it? - No, it's really dangerous. Oh, from so you heard? This is ridiculus. I went for job in IT. How could I be a government agent? Yeah, I am amazed about how you keep that a secret. You see how bad I'm going to be at this? - Oh, can we shoot Marcus? - No, it's... Marcus, damn it! - Sorry, can I? - Yeah. - Don't tell anyone! - Okay! Hey! Sorry! I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! - Are you okay? - Mommy said you'd be late. Yet another reason why she loaths you. - Is that true? - What do you think? Philip's never late. Can we please not discuss Philip? - No offense Philip. - Rodger that. 23 minutes late. - Make a note, please Philip. - Sorry muchacho! Can we get in the car? I'm actually quite cold. - Good response time, Mommy. - Won't be long now, Marcus! Ciao bud, you call me, eh? Stop saying that, I will never call you! 10-4. Ask me about the interview. - How was the interview? - It was good. - Did you get the job? - Yes I did. And what critical function will you be providing? Okay, you are not going to believe this, but your father is going to be responsible for... copying spreadsheets and imputting random data. It must be thrilling to have finally fulfilled your potential. It really is. Synced by slake www.addic7ed.com
