Eh ... Just wait a minute on the bed, and then I come immediately. Why, ... Dad, what the hell are you doing here? Sorry, that is, but I ... I know of no other way to reach you at.

There's a guy in your office. Says he knows you. Muhammad Ali. This I must see. Can I help you with something? Peace be with you, Johnny. - What the hell are you doing here? - I'm coming home. Have you gone mad? Do you think that beard and change his name to fool the police? I had a spiritual awakening. First I turned to Islam to be integrated. But God spoke to me, and immediately I realized what I had to do: Come home and confess what I did to Randi. Listen, your utakknemlige ayatolla-jævel! Many people helped out of the little jam. They become involved if you start chatting happily! Johnny ... I will not mention anyone else. I promise. Why could not you just continue to be lost? I knew I should never have come here. I'm truly sorry. Listen, Roarito ... I was wondering if you could do me a small favor? I must have delivered a package to some friends. Take it with you on your wedding cruise. - They meet up in international waters. - Can not they get it themselves? - Coast Guard do not like them much. - I do not know ... Come on. Two small bags. Not to say that my sister should marry a coward. It had made me very happy. See here ... Bring my sister a nice honeymoon. - Do you promise that it is not dangerous? - Do not you trust your man? He understands nothing, Rodrigo! - Wow, are you still here? - We have a possible insurance fraud. This surveillance video shows the driver that runs around the drysuit - - Only ten minutes before he can report that the car has gone through the ice. But come on, let's go and take us a glass of sherry. - Sherry? - After 30 years in law enforcement, I have come to - - That the best way to end the day is to take a glass on top Bar. Ok, it's you who is sheriff. Excuse me for interrupting. Mitt NavNet er Muhammad Abdul Aziz Ali. Jeg har ... It fits a little bad now. Can you come back tomorrow? Is it not possible to work a little bit overtime? I would like to have confessed to a murder. This is were you alone? It was only you who knew about it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bare og meg ... You're sure you do not want me to call a lawyer? No, what should I do with it? Yes ... You can read through once before you sign, so ... - I can not offer you a cup of coffee? - No thanks. Maybe a little chai, tea? -Chai?  - Yes. Yes, I'll see what I have. God is great. Ok, answer honestly ... What do you think about the new style of mine? I saw it in a kind of trendy magazine. Many cool guys had it. But on the other side ... Who wants to be cool all the time? Yes, I think I ... remove it. I'll take it. -Salute!  - Skål!
