 -Good morning ! Wake up. -Yes, Mom I'm up -Come down. I'm getting breakfast ready. -I don't want breakfast. And I don't want to cook, but no one listens to me. Get up. Nick! Why are doing this yourself? Where is the maid? What's her name? Maria. She can't come in early this week. What? Come on. You figured out how to talk to her yet?

 We're using "sign language" quite well. I think there's is a connect. A connect, eh? See my dance. What are you doing? Oh my God! Should we connect once before leaving? -Okay. Help Nick get ready. -Can't do it. -Help Nick get ready. -Can't stop dancing. -Get out! -I got moves. -Get out! -I got moves. Get out, please. GHOST DO EXIST. Nick! Have you been messing with my typewriter? Negative. I haven't touched your typewriter. Don't lie. I'm not lying.

 Dude, stop coming to my room every night. -Why? -What why? -Because you have your own room. -But I love sleeping with you. For god's sake, stop loving me so much. -What did Nick do? -Nothing. Mom, can we get this typewriter serviced? It's in a pretty bad condition right now. Yeah. It does look pretty sad, doesn't it? I'll see if there's someone in town. I used play on this typewriter when I was young. That time it was nice and shiny. That was what, like, 50 years ago? -You cheeky little thing! Come. -Okay. Madam? Oh! Maria, when did you come? [In Konkani] I didn't realize you were in the house. Do you want me to make you some tea? I can make you some tea if you want. Ah, okay. No. It's okay. I'll quickly grab a shower first. I'll take a shower... and come back. Then some tea. Where were you? I was waiting for you to come. Good grief! What strange thing is this woman doing! Hi, Maria. What happened? -Our Father who art in Heaven... -What happened? -Thy Kingdom come... -Maria! Maria, wait! What happened? -The evil is here. -What's upstairs? I am not staying in this house another minute. -You should leave too-- -Maria, listen to me... If you don't want to clean upstairs, that's perfectly okay. Okay? What... You. You are upstairs! You are upstairs! What? Nobody's upstairs. Everybody is out. Maria! Maria, wait! Maria, what happened? What happened? [In Konkani] It's an evil house. I don't want to work for you. Maybe, you are evil too. I saw you. Maria, I can't understand whatever you're saying. -Okay, okay. Calm down! -...who art in Heaven... Listen to me, Maria. Let's go back to the villa and try to find a solution together. No, no. I will go to my church and tell them about you. -Only the lord can save me from this evil. -[In Konkani] I doubt if he can. What can your lord do, that I can't? Maria! Our father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be Thy name... Dear God. You need help, Maria? Maria. -Doctor says it's an unnatural death. -What? I don't know, but he wants to show us something before he releases the body. -Alright. Where are you? -At the station, where else. Wait for me there. I'll drop Sam to school and come straight. Okay. Dad! Stop, stop! Stop the car! Stop! Sam! Sam! Sam, stop! Sam! Stop! Sam, what's wrong with you? What was that? Dad, look. Dad, can I go, please? Is this why you screamed and ran across the traffic? Dad, this is Doctor Spirit. The man who is aware of this world and the other He can see things normal people can't-- Sam, stop! You're sounding like a television commercial. And let's get one thing straight. When someone is driving, you don't scream like that. And you definitely do not run across the main road like that. You could have killed yourself. -Dad, but this is Doctor Spirit-- -Sam. You're not listening. I don't care if he is Doctor Spirit or Doctor Alcohol... You will never do anything like that again. Promise me. Sir, he's Doctor Spirit, not Doctor Alcohol. Ghost expert. Do you want to go to jail for pasting these posters illegally? -Dad-- -Sam, promise me. Now! Okay. I promise I'll never do that again. But, can I please go to the carnival? It's too good. Please. We are getting late for school. Come on. Guys, Doctor Spirit is coming to Bardez. -The Doctor Spirit? -Yes! Who has seen what normal people can't see? Same, same. Are you a fan too? Of course. When is he coming? Next month, along with the carnival, during half-term holidays. Class, pay attention. I've been asked by one of my colleagues, Father Aubrey of St. Andrews church, to help in the memorial service for a member of our community, Maria Lopes. We have been asked to perform "Auld Lang Syne", which was Maria's, and incidentally... I'm not doing any public singing. I am only a bathroom singer. Why are you telling me? Tell Father Mason. He'll give me detention. Then, tell Panda. Gablu is scared? Hey, I'm not scared. I'm waiting for Mason to leave. Thank you. So students, I'll leave you all to it. There. He left. Say now. Okay. I will tell him right now. -Sir? -Yes, Satyajit? Oh, here they are. Some of our seniors have kindly agreed to perform with us onstage. Please welcome them. -Good morning. -Good morning. Please, take your seats. So, we'll begin. Oh, yes Satyajit, you were saying something? Yeah. Sir, I think the song is a great choice. Thank you, even I think so. -What was that? -Now I want to sing. I don't understand. She was saying in Konkani. And then she left the house. -And then poor lady died on the way. -Maybe the pressure of working with you. Stop joking all the time, Peter. I don't know, maybe... Maybe she wasn't feeling well. -And she kept pointing upstairs. -I know, you told me. Peter, did I do something wrong? -Maybe I should have gone after her? -No, you haven't done anything wrong. Stop blaming yourself-- Sorry to bother you. Your wife is here at reception. Who? -Your wife. -Thank you. -Hello? What did she say? -Nothing. Can I call you back? Anita? Hey Peter, there you are. Guys, this funeral is important for us. But what's so great about Maria's funeral? I'm sure there's a funeral every day. But I overheard Dad saying that Maria's death was unnatural. Guys, this is our chance to spot a ghost. Yaar, remember? Lunar chart... Yeah. "When a person dies an unnatural death, the soul is trapped in between universes. Either it gets stuck in something, or it tries to get back into its own body, till the final rites are done." Maria's funeral will be performed three days after her death. I'm sure her soul will try to re-enter its body. Hang on a moment. How can a soul get stuck in something? How does that work? Man, Gablu. If you're not going to read the book, I'll have to ask you to resign. Gablu, I'll explain. You remember Aladdin's Genie who stays inside a lamp? -Yes. -Same to same, Gablu. Like a genie, a ghost can also stay in an object and come out when it pleases. But, unlike the Genie, the Ghost of Sultanpore was an evil piece of work who came out only to kill for its pleasure. He took pleasure in killing. No, not only pleasure. The Ghost of Sultanpore killed because it needed souls to keep itself in power. And, if it collected enough souls before a blood moon, the ghost would become all-powerful. Unstoppable. Oh yeah? You seem to know a lot. Apart from collecting souls, what's the other way ghost becomes all powerful? The only other way is if someone willingly offers their soul to the ghost. And that someone has to be really stupid to do that. Do you mean that Maria will try to re-enter her body at her funeral? That’s exactly what we have to find out. -Hi, sir. Hi, Selwyn. -Hi, Elvis. We're here to see the body of Maria Lopes. I'll get Doctor Patel for you, sir. Doctor Patel? -Is he new? -Yes, sir. He just joined us a week ago. But, sir, Dr. Patel is a little hard of hear--- There he is. -Doctor Patel? -Yes. -Inspector Anand. -And who? Eh? -Inspector and who? -Inspector Anand. Oh. Then say that. Come with me. What can you tell me about her? Er... she's dead? Head? What about her head? Her head is perfectly normal. Doctor, we don't know. You need to tell us if there's anything. You guys seem to be slow on the uptake. Being policemen, I was hoping you'd ask if there was something. Never mind. Let me tell you. Look at this. What is it? That's her heart. Her heart? How is that possible? Completely dry. How can anything be inside a human body? It looks as if someone has squeezed her heart by hand. I've never seen a heart attack like this before. If you look very carefully, it appears as if someone has squeezed her heart by hand. Can he not hear anything? Who can't hear? Er... Maria. Maria? Of course, she can't. She's dead, you idiot. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Inspector. I'm Vasco Lopes, Maria's husband. They are not letting me take her body. They are saying you need to authorize it. Please allow me to give her a proper burial. It's all my fault that Maria is dead. I shouldn't have forced her to work. -What do you mean? -We needed the money. So Maria had to work. And this happened when she was returning home from that Bardez Villa. -She never wanted to, but I forced her. -Wait. -Maria worked at Bardez Villa? -Yes. -Since when? -From almost two months. So what time did she go to work? Normally she'd go at 7 a.m. But this week I wasn't well so she went late. Around 7:45 a.m. I think. She had to reach by 8:00 a.m. You're telling me she reached work at 8:00 a.m. and left by 8:25 am? That's only 25 minutes of work. For such a huge villa? Did something happen? I don't know, Inspector. But all I know is that my Maria is dead. And that villa is evil. I shouldn't have let her work there. Why the fuck did you say you are my wife? Relax, Peter. It was just a joke. You seriously think anyone would believe I'd marry someone like you? Now before your office thinks we've run away on a honeymoon, we need to address some issues. In fact, a few million issues. What do you mean? -Well, what I mean-- -Can I get you something, ma'am? A glass of ice water, with a slice of lemon in it, please. -Yes, ma'am. -Thank you. Would you like some cookies with it? No cookies, please. You know what they say? "Once on the lips, forever on the hips." My husband is waiting for his 25 crores profit. -When are you delivering? -What do you mean "he's waiting"? That deal went bust long ago. You haven't told your husband yet? Ouch. I must have forgotten to tell him. -My bad. -Listen... Here, ma'am, water. Here you go. And this is on the house, fat-free and light. -Thank you, dear. -Let me know if you need anything. Yes. We need some privacy. Now listen to me very carefully. I had nothing to do with that deal. You got your husband to invest. Because you told me how profitable the venture was. I had no idea that it was a reserved land. I was just the architect. I had nothing to do with it. Then why did you leave Mumbai? Because I got a job offer here. Sure. Listen, Peter, you need to figure out a plan here. -What plan? -You're an architect. Build a plan to pay back my husband. Because he won't be very happy if he finds out that not only you lost his money, but also slept with his wife, he will be very angry. And honestly, I didn't mind sleeping with you. I've slept with worse. Take that as a bonus, but get the money back. Call me. But don't take too long. Arrey! Aren't you going to answer that? Bye, Peter. You... you are upstairs. We've just moved here from Mumbai. -Hello. -Hello. Sorry to bother, just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about Maria Lopes. -She worked here, right? -Right, she did. Why don't you come in? -Sure. -Yeah. Please. Have a seat. You'd like something? Tea? Coffee? No, I'm good. Do you know what happened? It appears she left your home pretty quickly. I'm still trying to figure it out myself. I came home after dropping everyone. She just saw me and ran out. -Why? -Yeah. And she kept pointing to the bathroom upstairs. -Was there someone in the bathroom? -No. I checked. I even checked just now, to see if I missed something. Nothing. -You want to take a look? -No. I'll take your word for it. Did she say something before she left? -She was saying something in Konkani. -What was she saying? I don't know. I don't speak the language, so I couldn't understand. And then, she just left. I feel as if It was my fault. I should have stopped her. Oh, I completely forgot! I have some news about your nanny. Oh, really? What? Do you remember someone called James who used to work for your grandfather? I hardly remember my grandfather. Come on. He was so famous. And this villa is a legend too. Everyone here knows the history of this place. My daughter Sam would do anything to be inside this villa. But why? -She's formed some kind of ghost society. -Okay. And since your grandfather is one of the most famous ghost writers, so-- This villa is filled with ghosts? -Have you seen any? -Yes, every time I look into the mirror. That's funny. Anyway, you were saying something about James. Can I meet him? Of course. You can. He has a pub in town, Good Head Bar. He owns the place. He remembers your nanny and her husband, Moses. Moses? Guard the Fakeer with your life, Moses. I have been serving the Fakeer for the last 30 years. I have left everyone for the Fakeer. I live alone, without family or friends to serve the Fakeer. But now I've had enough. I want to live the rest of my life in peace. But your life belongs to the Fakeer, Moses. The only way out is death. And that too, the Fakeer will decide. Have mercy on me. Have I not served enough? Listen to me, you whining old man. You're alive because Fakeer had mercy on you. Else, you would be long dead. You and that other man. What was his name? Tell me. What was his name, Moses? Tell me! Sorry, sorry! What was his name, Moses? James. James. He owns the Good Head Bar now. Oh! I know where that is. I didn't realize... Never mind. I'll pay him a visit later. What do I have to do now? Nothing. Just wait for the blood moon night. That's it. The night of the red blood moon is the best time to spot ghosts. Why? Haven't you seen "Mister India"? You can see invisible things under red light. The perfect night for ghosts to come out. I wish we had a PKE meter, like they had in Ghostbusters. But we have Buddy. He can smell ghosts. Right? There is another way. It says the surroundings will turn cold in the presence of a ghost. So, that's also a way to spot. How cold? -Do I need to bring a cardigan? -No, idiot. Why would you wear a cardigan? Shit! I have to go. My mother will blow her top if I'm late. Me, too. My dad has something to tell me. Okay, guys remember Maria's funeral is on Friday. Okay? Eat. Why aren't you eating? That will do. I don't like pumpkins. What kind of a Bengali are you, if you don't like pumpkins? The normal kind? But I thought you loved pumpkins. Last Holi you drove me mad to buy you a pumpkin. Halloween, mom. Not Holi. Whatever, but you wanted one. -Yes, but not to eat. -No? Then what did you do? Well, we carved it and made a lantern. What? You made a lantern out of a pumpkin? Ma, please! It's a tradition. You can't eat tradition. Talking about tradition, you'll be happy to know that you have been accepted at my school in Dehradun. -No. -Yes. I had to pull many strings to get you in there. You start post the summer holidays. -But I like my school here-- -End of discussion. Now, eat the pumpkin. I paid 200 rupees for that pumpkin. I'm counting on you, Buddy. If you sense a ghost, just give a signal. And once we find a ghost, it can take us to Mom. You okay? Yes. Just a bad headache. That's supposed to be my line. Good night. Good night. -Hello? -Hello. The bar is closed. Come in the evening. -Are you James? -Yes. My name is Jenny. Jenny? Jenny who? Madhav Mathews' granddaughter. Last I saw you, you were this small. At least you remember seeing me. I don't remember anything. -And that's why I need your help. -I know... you want to find out about your nanny. How do you know? That police fellow was mentioning. Yes, please. Do you have any idea where I can find her? Last I know, she left her husband and shifted to Palolem. Palolem? Where is that? -About a couple of hours from here.. -Okay. Anything else that can help me find her? It was all a long time ago. From the little, I remember Sara had this thing for saving money. Your best bet is... to go to the post office and see if she comes to collect her pension. The post office? Why? In our days, we only had one post office scheme for pension. Right. Okay. Thank you so much. -Hello? -Sir, it's your wife on the line. -Tell her I'm not in office. -Peter? Jenny? Hi. You didn't want to talk to me? I thought it was someone else. Just trying to avoid somebody. Okay. But I told her I'm your wife. Never mind. I'll explain later. Anything important? I think I have found my nanny. So, she stays in a place called Palolem. I think I will go there next week. Will you come with me? I don't know. Depends on work. Can I call you back? I'm really busy right now. Okay, see you in the evening. Bye. I'm so fucked! So now, the villa is suspect? Killer Villa! -Mira. -Yes, sir. Find out if anyone saw Maria coming back from Bardez Villa. And try to find more about Bardez Villa. Yes, sir. -Sushant. -Yes, sir. You find about Madhav Mathews and his daughter, Carol. Any report on... how Carol died? And the removal man who had died after he went to Bardez Villa. -Is there a connection? Find out. -Yes, sir. -Find out. -Yes, sir. -You know what I think-- -Selwyn. Stop cracking silly jokes. Go and talk to James again. -Come on. Get to work. -Yes, sir. Now, tell me. Are you sure all this has nothing to do with Jenny? This is why I don't let you speak. Sorry, sir. Just checking. Maria's funeral is tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. But our school is over at 3:30 p.m. How do we get out? -We fall sick? -All four of us together? Too obvious. We need the school to be over by 3:00 p.m. That way we all leave with no suspicion on us. The 'whole school'? How do we do that? We change the time. The school bell is operated only by Harish... who always opens his shoes when inside his cabin. And he has just bought new shoes. Tomorrow exactly at 2:40 p.m., we shall execute Operation School Bell. Sam will leave first. Sir, I need to go the toilet. We need exactly eight minutes to carry out the whole plan. But we need one member to be perfect. Aye! My shoe... At the same time... Give my pencil back! No, this is my pencil, not your pencil, okay? -That's my pencil. -No, it's not. Both of you! Principal's office. Right now. -Sorry, sir. -Sorry, sir. Bunty, why don't I get to take part? Nick, all of us can't go. Then it's too obvious. My shoe! Gablu, this table. Wait! Go. How did the dog do this? Guys, we don't have time. You, go up! What happened? I can't open it. Try harder. It's jammed. It's jammed. I can help. You? You guys really thought I was going to sit in the class while you have all the fun? How will you help? -Do you have a hair band? Rubber band? -Yes. Give it to me. -What are you doing? -It's almost done. Done. Point it towards the minute hand. -Okay. -Quick, he's coming back. You go divert him. Come on, Gablu. What has he done to my shoe? It's such an expensive pair. Hi, Harish. -Shouldn't you be in class? -Yes, I am going. -Okay. -That's a nice shoe. -Thank you. -But only one? One stupid dog ran away with it. A dog? Inside the school? Come on, Sam. You can do it. Try again! Yes. And I think I've seen that dog before. -I can't-- -Can I see that shoe? Yes, of course. Come on, Sam. Try to hit the metal. -Try, Sam. Try. -Towards the left. This is a soft cushion, all weather rubber sole. -A little left... -You can do it. Yes! Now towards the right. Keep going. Keep going. -Yes! -Yes! It's water-proof. It's very lightweight. -Bunty, where was this? -Here. I love these shoes. And the blue color... These are very lightweight, feels like you're walking in the air. I really like it. -I didn't like the red and-- -Have to go back to class. Oh, okay. We'll discuss later. Sir, may I come in? Why did you ring the bell at 3:00 p.m.? But it's 3:30 p.m., Father. How? In all my career, that clock has never been wrong. But it's 3:30 p.m. Good afternoon, Uncle. How are you? -Looking very smart today. -What do you want? Wanted to ask you some questions about Bardez Villa and Madhav Mathews. What's with you people? First your partner. Then that girl. Now you want to ask me again. What do I look to you? Some freaking Bardez Villa guide? One minute... Which girl? -That Jenny or whatever her name is. -Jenny. What did she want? None of your business. What do you want? Like I said, Madhav Mathews. No. Nothing comes to mind. But I haven't asked you anything yet. Even if you did, I'd still say the same. Come on, Uncle, This is Police work. This is very important. I don't care if it's Police work. Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to get the bar ready. -Please leave. -Okay, Uncle. I'm going... -but I'll come back later. -You can go to hell if you wish. Uncle did you not get any last night? Here, James, Mathew 24:29. "Immediately after the suffering of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light. The stars will fall from Heaven, and the powers of Heaven will be shaken." And that is the night, my friend, the Fakeer will rise. Only a matter of time now. How do you know? Nobody has heard of the Fakeer since Madhav Mathews died. He's there, in the same house where Madhav had got him. Waiting for the blood moon night. In Bardez Villa? Where? You don't need to know. But when the time comes, can I count on your loyalty? -James? -Yes? Yes, of course. Always. The Fakeer will reward you. "The Lord is my shepherd. I lack nothing. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside quiet waters. He refreshes my soul. He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake. Even though I walk through the darkest valley, I will fear no evil. I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever." In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Sam, now what? Buddy, I'm counting on you. You need to go and find out that... Oh, shit! Buddy! Buddy, stop! Buddy! Buddy, stop! Hey, hey! Sorry. Wow, cool! You're all stand in a straight line... Okay. -Good afternoon, Father! -Good afternoon. Afternoon. You, you, you and you. Come with me. Now. I have no idea how you did it, but I know you did. Did what, Father? Don't mock me, young fellow. I'm sad to see you also involved with these seasoned players. Especially you, Sameera Anand. Have you any idea what you've done to Father Aubrey? You're lucky I'm letting you go because of the memorial service. But be assured, I will take it up soon. Now go back to your choir. Not you, Sameera. You stay here, others can leave. Go, I said. I'm sorry, I cannot allow you to be here today. You may leave now. Jenny! Hello. I need to talk to you. Can we meet somewhere in private? -Right now? -Yes. I have to for this service. Can I meet you after the service? I can come to your bar. Okay, meet me then. Are you not staying for the service? -No, I have things to do. -Okay. James! You wanted to tell me something? Jenny, listen to me carefully. There's something in your house that you have to destroy! -What? -Have you ever heard about the Fakeer? Fakeer? I read some old newspaper cuttings. Doesn't matter. You cannot be seen with me. There is something in your house in which the soul of the Fakeer is trapped. Find out and set it on fire. Do it before the blood moon night. Hang on. I have no idea what you are saying. Just do it. You are the only person who can kill the Fakeer. Okay. But, before that... I'd have to kill you. James, you betrayed me. No. And there is only one reward for betrayal. We're gathered here today to celebrate and remember the life of Maria Lopes. She was a dear member of the... Sam, you're disturbing the service. Quick, sit here beside me. From a very young age, Maria dedicated herself to the service of others. The generosity of her spirit and kindness will...
