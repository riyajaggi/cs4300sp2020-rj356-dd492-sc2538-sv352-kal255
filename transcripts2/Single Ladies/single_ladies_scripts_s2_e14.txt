 Previously on single ladies... Just remember: What goes around comes around. This is the first time this creep has threatened me. I've gotten back with my ex-girlfriend. Mom, don't make a scene. If you don't want a scene, then you shouldn't be over here consorting with this home wrecker. You're the sweetest guy I ever dated. I was arrested for a dui. You're my only call. He needs me to go bail him out.

 I'm gone. Where have you been? In rehab. I hope you can forgive me. Of course. I'll move to New York with you. Come here! I think you are in denial about your feelings for Charles. Look, Charles, I said I was over him. I wish you were over him so bad, but you're not. And I will respect that, but only for so long. Oh! You idio-- oh, hi. I am so embarrassed. Please, forgive my clumsiness, and accept my deepest apologies.

 Allow me to help you inside. I'm kasseem. I'm-- absolutely, positively radiant. Well, I was gonna say Morgan, but that has a nice ring to it. Please. Darn it. These were my favorite heels. Took me forever to break these in. I can have them repaired. I'm not sure this shoe can take another coat of glue. Excuse me. Hello? I'll be right there. Please, forgive me, Morgan, but I am in a hurry to get to a meeting. How can I make this up to you? Really? It was truly a pleasure meeting you. Aw, hell no. The man asks how he can make this up to you, and you just let him leave? I didn't wanna be greedy. Besides, it was an accident, and he said he was sorry. Nothing says I'm sorry like a new pair of shoes. And we all know if you get a new pair of shoes, you automatically have to-- get a new bag to match. Well, I'm glad you all can quote me, but you need to put it into practice. Has none of this rubbed off? Hoo! Parker. I told him I liked his lips, so then he said if I had a garden, he would put my tulips and his tulips together. Never mind. It was cute and funny, and you had to be there, but it led to a romantic night, and now we're together. Exclusively? This is your first real relationship since Derek. How does it feel to be off the market? Feels great. Now I don't have to avoid five different guys on my birthday. What? I couldn't find a sitter. Get over it. Mm. Keisha, maybe if you sent Sean some flowers, then he'd come around. Uh, weren't we talking about Omar's relationship? How did we jump to mine? Because hasn't it been five days since you heard from him, and haven't you left him a ton of messages? Since you already know the "t," why are you asking? I'm assuming he's still pissed at me for choosing Malcolm over him, but, really, that's not what I did. Okay, technically, that's what I did, but I said I'm sorry. I even tried to call. What else can I do? Nothing. Sounds like your tulips have already done enough. I hope you guys can bounce back from this. Hmm. I don't know. Our boat was already getting rocky. All those little things that used to annoy me about him are starting to work my nerves again. Sometimes, those are the very things that can be deal-breakers. Well, there's one deal I'm definitely not gonna break, and that's the one I made to shine doing my presentation at my real estate conference. I'm going to go figure out what to pack for Phoenix. Oh, I heard it's supposed to be 115 in the shade this weekend. Oh, and even hotter once I get there. Three, four, five, and he got my size right. This just doesn't happen. This isn't real! These are from that guy you said bumped into you earlier? But he's not screwin' around. Mm-mmm. What does the card say? "Because I didn't know what you'd like, I wanted to give you options. My apologies again. I would love to have dinner with you, call me. Kasseem." If these fit me, you're gonna have to come to New York to get 'em back. Oh. I can't believe you're really moving. I can't believe how fast you and Reggie found an apartment. I can't believe I'm not gonna see you guys anymore every day. I'm gonna miss you, April. I'm gonna miss you too. I keep thinking, "am I doing the right thing? Is this the right time? Is he the right guy?" I'm happy for you, but sad at the same time. First, I lose Charles. Now you're moving. I mean, why is this all happening at once? Well, in between my prayers asking that I win the lottery and marry the rock--whichever you give me first is fine-- I've also been asking for Charles to come back to you. Thank you. That makes two of us. Hi. Hi. Uh--can we talk? Of course. Come in. Who else wants something from God? Because I am on a roll. It is so good to see you, Raquel. It's so weird you came by. I just mentioned you. Yeah? Yeah. I mention you a lot. I guess you're, um-- you're on my mind a lot. Well, I think of you too. Remember how you were always on me to go after national advertisers? Well, I landed smirnoff. Yeah, they think my magazine has the right demographic. Ah, that's great, Charles. Yeah, they're throwing a huge party to launch new flavors. Plus, they bought major ad space. Anyway, I know it could be awkward, and I struggled with it. Do I invite you? Do I not? But padma insisted. She says there's no reason why we can't all be friendly. She sounds sweet. So please come. I'm gonna have to think about it and get back to you. Yeah, sure. Since I'm his "special friend," I just got invited to his party, where I can get a front row seat to watch him and padma be a couple. Okay, so what you gonna wear? I'm not going. Who wants to watch the man that they love be with another woman? Was that the "l" word I just heard? I heard it too. If I felt the way I do now that day in the elevator, things would be very different. So go to the party. I'm not gonna break up a happy couple. Nobody's suggesting that... ish. But you and Charles were building something. Yeah, maybe you gave up too easily. Keisha, what's happening? Somebody's following me around... And texting the pictures to prove it. Who the hell is doing this to me? New York starter kit. Mm-hmm. Subway map. Need it. Bergdorf's. Mm. Roach spray? You never know. Awesome. Oh, there's one more. A dinner invitation. Ooh! From my mom. Uh, I-I don't know, Reggie. I met your mother before, remember? I don't think I can handle a repeat of her performance at the boule ball. Oh, this is different. She knows we're together. She knows I love you. But if she does act up, just compliment her Mac and cheese. Maybe I could bring my sweet potato pie. Yeah, don't. Baby steps. Does everybody get this much love in here? Oh, the owner and I are both from Bahrain, and he knows my family. We are a small island nation where everybody knows everyone. In a lot of ways, Atlanta's a small town like that. I appreciate it when my neighbor calls and warns me that my daughter's at the bus stop trying to drop it like it's hot. What? I'm a single parent. It takes a village. But, really, with Nicole, all it takes are these eyes. You are so different from the women I usually meet. You speak your mind, you make me laugh, yet you do it with such grace and charm and no pretense. Well, there is a little pretense. I'm doing it in a new pair of shoes. Hey. Came as fast as I could. Something tells me you're not remodeling. I've already identified the type of snake he left from the picture you sent. It's a California king. Oh... we'll be hitting the pet shops first thing tomorrow, looking for the buyer. Thank you so much for helping me. Of course. You know, I was hoping our relationship would be different when I got back, but I missed my window again. Doesn't matter though. You can call me for anything. Thank you. Now I need you to make a list of any possible suspects. Thanks again for being my escort on such short notice. I couldn't let you do this alone. Besides, I know how devastating it can be to see your ex with someone new. Trust me on that. The people are buzzing about you. Seems I've done my best work. Omar, I picked my outfit. Yes, but I pushed up, re-situated, and accentuated. And my work is done. You go make your move. I'll be over there trying that new flavored vodka. I'm glad you made it. Padma, this is Raquel. Pleasure to meet you. I've heard so much about you. And I, you. This is Antonio. Antonio, that's Charles. Charles. Right, uh, you two grew up together. That's right, man. It's been great to reconnect. We're going to our table. Join us? Great. Thank you. I knew I'd find you at the bar. So how's our girl doing? You might wanna send her one of these. Oh, wow! That's yummy and sweet. Absolutely. And you can do lots of things with it. You can do it as a Martini, you can do it on the rocks, or you can do it up. Mm! This kissed caramel vodka is my new favorite. Make sure you try the iced cake too. Whoa, whoa! Damn! Sorry, man. Oh, no problem. Hi. I'm drew. Omar. Can we...Get one more? Get out of here! Wha--you play clave, congas, and the timbales? Yeah. Man, I respect anyone who can handle percussion. I couldn't. Charles is a passionate conversationalist, isn't he? It's one of my favorite things about him. My ex-husband was the exact opposite. Very measured, very controlled. I never should've married him. But I didn't want to bring shame to my family. Charles mentioned you had a similar situation? My experience wasn't exactly like yours. I broke it off with Victor before we got married, but my family was very upset. I admire you for having ended things before you got married. Thank you. Hey! Antonio knows a place with a great mambo band for us to check out after this. What do you think? Maybe another time. Wait, you mean that giant billboard talking about "Tommy needs a buddy too," that was you guys? My company didn't want to take on any more pro Bono work, so I had to fight for us to do it. Well, I'm glad you did. That campaign really moved me. That's great. You just made my week. Excuse me. April, I need you to slap me right now. Why? Because I'm thinking inappropriate things about this man and I have a boyfriend. Bitch, you know I wasn't serious! I didn't mean for you to literally slap me! You just admitted to being scandalous. I swear I'm not being a horn dog, but I've been really feeling something with this guy. Like substance. What, and Parker doesn't have substance? I don't know! It's weird, but I remember feeling the same thing with Derek, and I fell in love with him. Do I need to slap you again? Girl, if you do, we'll be catfighting all over this party. Hmm. Look, you should give me your number. I have to leave, but I'd like to see you again. I don't think that's such a good idea. I'm in a relationship. Oh... well, can we at least be friends? Are you available for that? Hey, I'm so glad you decided to come. Me too. Congratulations, Charles. Everything's coming together for you. You too. Antonio, real pleasure to meet you. My pleasure, man. Nice to meet you. Oh, Charles, man... He's a good guy. Yeah. Padma's pretty cool too, isn't she? Damn. I guess I'd better leave it alone. I'm sorry. But, hey, perhaps it's for the best. Okay? Today was heaven, kasseem. Thank you. I will call you this evening to make sure you have arrived home safely. Aw, you don't have to do that. Yes, I do. You have already become quite precious to me. Until tonight. So where exactly is heaven located these days? Downtown. He took me on a horse-drawn carriage ride through the city during rush hour traffic. He's perfect. I'm dumping him. What? Why? Because this makes no sense. He's been all over the world, speaks six languages, and sent me $5,000 worth of shoes. I spent two summers in biloxi, Mississippi, got a b-minus in English, and most of my shoes are buy one, get one free. So what are you saying? You think kasseem's out of your league? I saw this TV show once, where men and women secretly ranked themselves. Do you know all the sixes picked sixes, and all the nines picked nines? Nobody picked anyone more than a point from their number. Okay...One, that sounds like very destructive programming. Two, you're crazy if you think that applies here. Don't get me wrong, I think I'm cute and have plenty to offer. I'm just used to dating the chauffeur, not the guy being chauffeured. Morgan, he likes you. So just focus on how you feel about each other, and nothing else should matter. Hm. Um, neither, unless you're going to a funeral. I kind of am. I'd rather die than see Reggie's mother again, but I promised to go, so I'm gonna play it safe. You need to play it like you. Don't switch up for no judgmental biddy. Yeah, and Reggie wouldn't take you home unless he set her straight about how important you are to him. I know, but that doesn't make it any easier. Oh. This is cute though. Please. Malcolm said he needs to talk to me in person, and it's urgent. But I don't need his drama right now, mm-mmm, especially not before I go to Phoenix. I need to focus. Yeah. Padma? Hello. May I have a word with you? Of course. Conventional wisdom says I should leave well enough alone. But there's nothing truly conventional about wisdom, is there? I suppose there isn't. I love Charles, and I'm thrilled to be back in his life, but I need to be sure he's happy, and I can only do that if he makes an informed decision between us. But he's already chosen you. I'd feel better if he made that choice knowing you love him too. I did not see that coming. Shh. He told me you didn't love him, and he still believes that. Padma, I don't think we should be having this conversation. I think you should tell Charles how you feel. I owe him that much. He has no clue I'm here, so... Next move is yours. Good-bye. Did she just ask me to tell the man that she loves that I love him too? I know it sounds crazy, but she has a good point. I mean, who wants to be with a guy who's in love with someone else? Please, as hard as it is to find a good man, what woman in her right mind would offer up her own? I bet she's convinced he won't choose you, but wants her conscience clear. And doesn't mind letting Raquel play herself to do it. Damn! That is mastermind. Every time I think I understand you bitches, you take it to a whole other level. God, I don't know what to do. Girl, please. Go get your man. It's all cued up, but I don't know how to hook it up to their system. I've done tons of these. I'll take care of it. And don't be so nervous. It's just--it's my first time. You'll be great. I've seen you in action. And after we're done, some local realtors invited us to party with them in scottsdale. And by "local," I mean "cute." Malcolm? What are you doing in Phoenix? I'm gonna go get you set up. You speak in less than ten, so don't go disappearing on me. I told you that we needed to talk. And I told you I had a conference. I'm about to give a presentation in powerpoint. Yes, keisha Greene knows powerpoint. Okay, here's the thing. I left Taylor. Why? Clearly she's quicker at bailing you out of jail than me, so you might wanna rethink that. Keisha, I had one phone call, and I made it to you. But I was late coming home, Taylor freaked out and called around. She found me. The bottom line is it's over. So...Say something. You say something. You're the one who came all the way here. Why are you playing games? You may have broken up with Taylor, but I'm still with Sean. That's your response to this? Should I have a different one? Well, we both racked up today. You on clothes, me on commission. Well, I did go a bit overboard, but I'm only in Atlanta for a short time, and I love shopping in America. Well, me too, when I can afford it. Adirah Al jahni! I know a kasseem Al jahni. Any chance you're related? Well, yes, he's my husband. How do you know kasseem? I--he, uh, came into the store. Oh, well, he does love to shop too. Thanks. Have a good day. Kasseem is married? I should've known no man was that perfect. I just wanna go back to my quiet, ordinary life, and forget kasseem ever happened. Sometimes, life is hard. Yeah. Sometimes, we make it that way. Take Charles and me. I never would've lost him if I wasn't so out of touch with my own feelings. Raquel, you're gonna have to find a way to make peace with that situation. I know, but I don't think I will unless I tell him how I feel. What? It's about time. Do you need to me to dial for you? No. Damn! Voicemail. Eh, Charles, it's Raquel. Please call me as soon as you get this. It's important. Very important! You know, there's so many kids out there who need a stable, loving home. I wanna adopt one day. Do you want kids? A boy and a girl. I'll raise them to be smart, open-minded, and extremely stylish. My break's been over for ten minutes. I gotta get back to work. Oh, yeah, me too. It's funny, I lost track of time the last time we hung out too. That always happens when I'm in sync with somebody. I feel like I've known you forever. I can't do this. I'm sorry. I had no right. I hope this doesn't mean you're gonna end our friendship. I have to. I'm also going to end my relationship... So I can start one with you. Uh, uh, uh! I'm not free yet. April! Hi, I'm Gayle. Reggie's favorite cousin and the family beauty. Which doesn't say much for our looks overall. Aww. Oh, you remember my mom. Hello, Mrs. westfield. April, I'm happy you came. Welcome. Three times. I was telling you. See, I told you my boyfriend was finer than yours. Trudy didn't believe me. She thinks Harold is such a prize. So, um, I've got something I really need to talk to you about. Look, this is hard for me. You've been such a sweetheart, and I like you. I just-- drew! What, how did you-- that's my brother. It's hard to believe we live in the same city. I never see this guy. You're gonna love him. Hey! Hey, man! Omar, this is drew. Hey! Hey! How are you? Harold. Hi. I really appreciate you fixing that lamp for me. Ah, no problem. For what that jerk wanted to charge you, and he was making you wait--no way. This won't take long. You have a ladder? In the storage room. Okay, I'll be right back. Charles, hi. I see you've been trying to reach me. Is everything okay? Are you home right now? Um, can I come by and talk to you? Raquel, I can't. The car is coming soon to take me and padma to the airport. The airport? Yeah, we're heading out of town for a few weeks. Yeah, I'm sorry, but I gotta finish packing. Can we talk when I get back? Okay, fine. Okay, bye. Damn it! I'm not gonna be able to talk to him before he leaves town. Call him back. No. I need to tell him how I feel in person. I'll talk to you guys later. Was that about Charles? Oh... is she going to try to get him back? But I love her. Oh. I'm gonna get her back. Raquel! Hey, kev. I got a beamer and three other cars that I haven't seen around here before. I need you to run the plates for me. Wait, hold on. I hate I couldn't meet you in Arizona. I've missed you. Yeah, you didn't act like it, ignoring my calls. Yeah. Sorry about that. I just needed some space to think about us and-- turn around! Keisha! Aah! Veronica! Veronica! Stop! No! Hold on, keisha, I'm coming! Veronica, what the hell are you doing? You took my man, and now you're gonna pay! Aah! Oh! This Veronica Vanderbilt, who owns that beamer, bought a California king snake? Kev, I gotta go. Keisha? What the hell is goin' on? Aah! Oh! Malcolm! Oh, no, bitch. Now you're gonna pay! No! Aah! Ow! No! Aah! Ugh! Oh! Aah! Keisha! Oh! Oh! What? What? Keisha! It's okay, it's over. Malcolm! Malcolm. What I did, I did out of love. I'm sorry. You two are free to go too. I ain't goin' nowhere. Oh, guys, please don't start. Actually, the two of you can go. I need to be with keisha right now. I'm not leaving until keisha says I should go. I don't work for you. Do you work at all? Because if you did, this never would've happened to keisha. And you. You're the main one who needs to leave. You brought that crazy bitch into her life. Yo, man, I asked you to leave nicely. Next time, I won't be so polite. Okay. So what are you gonna do then? Oh! Aah! I've been waiting for this. No, no, no, no! Oh! Aah! No! Stop it, damn it! Winston, do something! Everybody, please, just go. Go! Sean, can you stay a minute? Call me. Yeah. I'm here. There you are. You are not responding to my calls. Has something happened? Yes. Your wife happened. May I have a chance to explain? What's to explain? You have a wife. I knew you were too good to be true. I do not have a wife. I have three. What? Islamic law allows for a man to have up to four, if he can afford to support them. Well, then, I guess congratulations are in order three times over. I was going to tell you about all of this eventually, but apparently, now is the time. So... I am a prince. My cousin is the king. Three wives? A prince? Any other bombshells you wanna drop? Yes. I know this is sudden, but will you be my fourth and final wife? Is this reality, because it feels like Ashton kutcher's about to jump out from behind a clothes rack. I am very serious, Morgan. You want me to be a part of a harem? Of course not. That is completely different, and I would never insult you like that. I revere and respect my wives. So everybody's just one big, happy family, huh? Yes, especially because they all have their own houses and their own lives. You can have one right here in Atlanta, and your daughter can go to the best schools, as it will be my duty to finance her education. You can work, go to school, start your own business, or just relax. Kasseem, we've only been on three dates. We barely know each other. I know myself. I trust my instincts, and I know how I feel about you. So you want me to be your princess? Will you? I know... but let me say it first. You and me aren't you and me anymore, are we? I'll always love you, Sean, but we're different now. I really tried to make this work, but we're not there. Yeah. Well, I think we both know why you couldn't get there. Last time around, it was on you. This one's on me. I'd call it even, except I still feel like the loser. Well, you'll always be close to my heart. You know that, right? Yeah. Good-bye, keisha. Good-bye, Sean. Helene, everything is delicious. I told you mom's Mac and cheese was not to be missed. Oh. Reggie, you're my only son, and you know I love you more than anything. Yeah, I'm pretty clear on that. Uh, what's going on? We love and support you no matter what. But we can no longer continue to let you live a lie, so the family decided to hold this intervention. Are you on drugs? No! Mom, what the hell is this? Please stop playing games with other people's lives, and admit, once and for all, Reggie, that you are gay. G-- hey. How's your head? Hard as ever, but I'm changing that. Oh? How so? I almost lost you today. I went home, and I thought about that, and it made me sick. Baby, the way it's been going all these months is not how it's supposed to go, not with us. What are we doing? Keisha, I love you. I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again. This is where I wanna be. This is where I belong... With you. Okay, so how do we do this? Maybe start fresh, someplace new. You mean leave Atlanta? I can run Frank's jewels from anywhere. Zurich, Amsterdam, Beverly Hills, Vegas. Vegas is where we met and had the most luck. So what do you say? So much has changed in the last 24 hours. I need to think. You know where I go when I've got big decisions staring me down? Up. Up? Charles! Charles! Charles, wait! Raquel. Charles! Raquel, what's wrong? Charles! I couldn't let you go without telling you. Charles, I love you. Ready?
