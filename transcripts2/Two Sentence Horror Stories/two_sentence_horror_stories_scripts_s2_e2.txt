 _ Once upon a time, there was a boy who found himself lost between two realms. Okay. We're switching it up today. Girls, stay here for jumping jacks. Boys, you've got relay sprints up the track. Go! Come on, let's go! Uh, no. No, no, no, honey. You're with the girls. Front row seats at the freak Olympics. [GIGGLING] OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn

 [DOOR CLOSES] STUDENT: Oh, my gosh, look. [SIGHS] Hey, Elsa? Is everything okay? Mr. Ortiz? It's Elliot, remember? Right, Elliot. Of course. I'm so sorry. [TOILET FLUSHING] [CLEARS THROAT] Principal Meyers. Oh dear, this is the men's room. - I'm a boy. - A-ah. You either got the equipment or you don't.

 It's not that simple. Oh, well maybe in the city this kind of thing flies. But around here, the policy is no boys in the girl's room, and no girls in the boy's room. Sounds pretty simple to me. But you know, I'm just here to enforce the rules. Hell, maybe there's something you're not telling me. So please, feel free to uh, use the urinal if you got what it takes. [DOOR SLAMS] [OUT OF BREATH] [DOOR SLAMS] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] [DISTANT LAUGHING AND CHATTING] [SHARP WHISTLE] [EERIE MUSIC] [EERIE MUSIC] [GASPS] [LAUGHS] Oh jeez, kiddo. You scared me. Not used to having visitors down here. Why didn't you turn the lights on? I didn't know they still worked. Yeah, it's a dump. I know. Welcome to my world. [LAUGHS] Well, it's nice to have some company for once. What's your name, kiddo? I'm Elliot. Pleasure to meet you, Elliot. I guess I scared the dung beetles out of you too, huh? Yeah. Thought I heard something. Hmm. Oh. You're a musician. Yeah. I mean... I guess I want to be? Hmm. I started writing my own music in there in 5th grade. Hmm, yeah. I can see you really put your soul into this. You came down here to get away, didn't you, kid? How did you know? I've been here a long time, kiddo. I know what goes on up there. I know the kinds of things kids like them do to kids like you. What do you mean, "kids like me"? Oh, you know, musicians, artists, the sensitive type. It's a real shame. I can't tell you how many good ones I've had down here over the years. Crying alone in the dark. But I'll tell you something. I don't pity you. Uh-uh. I pity them. They're just nasty little people with nasty little hearts. Ugh. You know, don't get me started. You like pistachios? [SHELLS CLATTERING] Yeah! [LAUGHS] So come on. Are you going to tell me what's eating you, huh? I mean, just what are they doing to you up there? I don't know. I guess... Everyone in this town just seems so backward. I just wish I had one person to talk to. Hmm. I mean, I can't even go to the bathroom without getting messed with. [SIGHS] What you need is for these folks to stop picking on you, right? Tell me. What does it feel like when they're all staring at you and laughing at you? It feels like torture, I guess. Like this pain that just fills my whole body and I can't do anything to stop it. Hmm. Have you ever seen one of these? It's called a Dolor Ocarina. And it is a very special instrument. In what way? Well, for starters, it's like any old instrument. You know, you pour your heartache into your music. People hear that, right? You pour your pain into this bad boy, and they feel it. [CHUCKLES] Imagine. People feel the way that you feel. If they knew what it was like, maybe they'd leave me alone. That's right, Elliot. They'd think twice about messing with you again. So you're saying it's magic or something? Well why don't I just let you borrow it for a little while and you can... you can see for yourself. We could make a trade. What kind of a trade? A page of your songbook. Something precious of mine for something precious of yours. [SIGHS] [EXHALES] How do I play it? TEACHER: Okay guys, so that wraps up chapter 36. You can open up your textbooks and read ahead... JANITOR: The next time somebody messes with you, when you're feeling all that pain inside, just play them a little song. [GIRLS GIGGLING] GIRL: Hey, Elliot, we want to hang out with you. Come out so we can do your makeup. [GIRLS GIGGLING] Hey! Oh, no. [GIGGLING] What is that? [LAUGHS] [DISCORDANT WHISTLING] [SCREAMING] [DISCORDANT WHISTLING] [SHRIEKING] [GIRLS CRYING] We'll never do it again. We're so sorry. I wish you could've seen their faces. They actually started apologizing and like, saying how sorry they are. Sounds like having one of these could really change your life, huh? Yeah. You know, for the right price, I could make it yours to keep. So that you could protect yourself whenever you felt like it. Really? But what, what would you want for it? Your songbook. The whole thing. My whole heart and soul is in this. I... I wouldn't know who I am without it. Yeah, but that's what makes it so valuable. I don't know. I have other things I could trade. Come on, kid. You know what I'm offering you, right? Safety, power. For a songbook. [SIGHS] Fine. Look, I got a lot of work to do. Wait. I guess I can always write new songs. Good choice, kiddo. [DOOR SLAMS] My little sister said you messed up her and her friends. It wasn't like that. They were the ones who were messing with me first. Do you have any idea how much you freaked her out? I can explain. [DISCORDANT WHISTLING] [SCREAMING] [GRUNTING IN PAIN] [GRUNTING IN PAIN] Stop! Take your seats, everyone. We'll pick it up with the Florence Price Symphony 1 in E minor. [OUT OF BREATH] [ECHOING SCREAMS] Elliot. You feeling okay? [PANICKED BREATHING] [DOOR SLAMS] Going somewhere? Please, I have to go. You are not going anywhere until you tell me what you did to Tony. Come on, you were spotted running away from where we found that boy. I was defending myself. Yeah, you act all innocent, but you're like rotten fruit. Poisoning the minds of these other kids. I am not going to allow you to destroy my school. You're hurting me. What is that? [DISCORDANT WHISTLING] [YELLING IN PAIN] [YELLING IN PAIN] [YELLING] Hello? That one's for you, kid. I'll soon save you from your human husk. But don't worry, I'll take great care of it. What did you do to them? What's happening to me? Oh, you'll get used to it. It's the essence of your suffering that matters. All your pain will live on forever in the Dolor Ocarina, far beyond your husk. Essence of suffering? I'm more than just my pain. And my body isn't yours to take and shove it in some locker! Your rage is delicious. You tricked me. You just like hurting people! Take it. I don't want to turn into one of those things. Oh, you already made your choice, honey. PRINCIPAL: I know you're down here. What perfect timing. Play one last song for the bad man, and all that you feel will be living in the Ocarina forever. Where are you, you little freak? You see what a vile man he is? You'll be doing the world a favour. You're just as bad as him. I'm done with everyone trying to twist me into something I'm not! I never wanted to hurt anybody. I just wanted them to know what I was going through. Hurt or get hurt, Elliot. There's only two choices. [CLANGING SOUNDS] What did you do to me up there? What are you? I knew you were unnatural the first time I saw you. - I am not. - You're dangerous. [GRUNTING] [DISCORDANT WHISTLING] [GROANS] [BONES CRACKING] [BONES CRACKING] [SLOW CLAPPING] [LAUGHS] Bravo, Elliot. You see? Hurt or be hurt. I told you that you finally have to make a choice. Oh, but you can't hurt me. What are you doing?! Without that instrument, you're going to be weak forever. Is that what you want? Stop, Elliot! I will give you this back. All your precious music. But break my instrument and you will never, ever play music again. Only silence will come from those lips. I don't believe you! No! Noooo! [SOBBING] It's okay, it's okay. You're okay. The janitor's gone. Or whatever it was. And Principal Meyers will be out cold for a while. [SERENE MUSIC] [DISTANT CHATTERING] See? Told you flutes are hella gay. Hey jackass, say that louder. For the internet. Whatever. Hey. Did you hear? Our new principal starts tomorrow. I got you guys something. - A friendship ring. - Thank you. Just a group of small town queerdos. You're a queerdo. [LAUGHS] [PHONE CAMERA SNAPS] [SCHOOL BELL RINGS] [SERENE MUSIC] And eventually the boy grew into an old man and his distant memories became stories, bound in an old dusty book. But the truth is, he never did forget about the witch. And she never forgot about him either. _
