 Shh. You can't disturb your mama. I'm Antonio, remember? I work with your mama. I'm keeping an eye on you while she works. Is she still mad at me? Did she tell you she didn't want to talk to me? We had a big fight. I don't want to talk to her either. - You don't mean that. - She said mean things to me. She's your mother. I know you want to talk to her. I didn't mean to run away. It's just that I want to see Papa. Si, si.

 I want to bring him home. You and your mother will talk when it's right. For now you have to stay here while she works. It's a very busy and stressful day for both of us. I can't always be with you, but I'll come back and check on you when I can. Do you understand? You work with people after they die. What do you do in that room? I... help. My job is to help. Was that a real dead body? Was it a kid like me? I'll make you a deal. I have to get back to work right now. But if you promise to stay here, I'll come back in a bit and answer all your questions. Okay. Fine. [DOOR OPENS, CLOSES] GRACE: Child, 8. Male. Preliminary assessment. Rigor mortis set in about 12 hours ago. He's been dead for at least a day. ANTONIO: Pobrecito. He was found trapped in the back of a delivery truck. Appears to be heat stroke. [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] Antonio? Asphyxiation. Airtight delivery truck. The driver said he didn't know when the boy crawled in, and his route started in San Diego. [SIGHS] [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] - [PHONE RINGS] - [GASPS] [PHONE RINGS] VOICEMAIL: You've reached the Good Shepherd's Way Morgue. Please leave a message and someone will get back to you. [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEP] Hey, it's me again. Look... - Papa! - I know you're busy, but I just wanted to see if you could come this weekend. And I know I ask every year, but can you just take some time off from work? [ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS] [SIGHS] GRACE: Why can't everyone just leave me alone? [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] Hello? [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] Are you okay? [CRYING] [SCREAMING] [PANICKED BREATHING] [GASPS] It's me. It's me. [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] What was that? What was what? That? That's the family of one of the muertos. The boy in the green shoes? No. Someone else. What about that boy? Where's his family? I'm trying to help find out. Are ghosts real? Hmm... What does your mom and dad say? My dad says yes, but Mama says no, that's a stupid idea. You don't celebrate Día de los Muertos? Mama says it's made up and not for kids. Oh, no. Día de los Muertos is for everyone. And it's not made up. We have that day to celebrate, but we can communicate with our muertos any time if we just listen. What if they're angry though? And scary. Sometimes a ghost has pain they didn't take care of before they died, and it can make them scary because they need help to find peace. How do you help them? You start by listening to them. They can be confused, scared. They're trying to figure it out. I'm sorry, it's just been a hell of a week. I know. Month, year, three years. Yes. I'm just cansada, Jorge. Broken-hearted. There's this little boy on my slab, and I... That's exactly why I wanted to bring up this. His afterlife will take him to where he needs to be. Why do you always have to go there? You know I don't believe in that afterlife stuff. I bring this up because you know how important... I hate it when you bring it up like it's supposed to make me feel better. It should. This is your life, you understand what we're talking about. - Why would you want to go... - You know what, I really have to go. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] Hello? Is that you? [EERIE MUSIC] [DOOR CLOSES] [DOOR CREAKS OPEN] Hello? Do, do you want to talk? [DOOR SLAMS] [DOOR LOCK CLICKS] [POUNDING ON DOOR] Hey! [LOUD THUNDEROUS POUNDING] [SCREAMING] Help! Help! Please! Antonio! Help me! Help! [SCREAMING] Help! Please! [THUNDEROUS SOUNDS STOP] [DOOR UNLOCKS] [CREAKING] [GASPS] [SHRIEKING] [KNOCKING] Hello? [LONG EXHALE] Help, please! Help me, please! Help! Help me, please! Help! Please help! Help me, please! [SCREAMS] Help! Please! Laura? What are you doing in here? You can't be in here. You told me to talk to them. You said ghosts needed to be listened to. Laura, did you see a ghost? - I want my mom. - You can't. I want my mom. She's in the middle of something. You said you were here to help, and you're not. [SIRENS WAILING IN THE DISTANCE] [TAPPING RHYTHMICALLY] Mama? [TAPPING RHYTHMICALLY] Mi hija! You never listen to me. GRACE: None of this would have happened if you'd just listened to me. But Mama... LAURA: It's not my fault! GRACE: I'm so mad at you, Laura. I hate you! Stop wasting time, get back to work. [LAURA CRYING] [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] [CRYING IN THE DISTANCE] [RUNNING FOOTSTEPS] [GASP] [GASP] [SCREAM] [LAURA SCREAMING] [PANICKED BREATHING] [SCREAMS] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [SCREAMING] [SOBBING] [SIGHS] Go to him. Go to your papa. [GASPS] He didn't know he was a muertito. He thought his papa left him all alone. Abandonado. He needed to have closure with his papa so he could have peace. How did you know? I told you. My job is to help. Not your mama anymore, but the spirits that are lost here. Are you a ghost? [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] [SIGHS] Asphyxiation, at least a day. I am, little Laura. Now it's your turn, muertita. Every year since you died, your mama works herself to the bone near the other muertos. [SCREAMING] Laura! No! Every year you come here, and I try to help you find peace with her. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES] Did I do that? Why are you so upset, Laura? What can't you let go of? I told her I hated her. Right before I ran away. LAURA: I hate you! Right before I... I told her I hated her and wished she would die. [TAPPING RHYTHMICALLY] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLES RHYTHMICALLY] [SNIFFS] [TEARFULLY] Is it you, Laura? Do you come every year to scare me? To tell me you hate me? I know. I know because it's all my fault. [TRAFFIC SOUNDS] [DISTANT SIRENS] [SOBS] I don't know how to go on without you. It's too hard. I miss you so much. [SOBBING] Laura? I'm right here, Mama. Don't be stupid, Grace. I'm right here! [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING RHYTHMICALLY] I L-U-V U... I L-U-V U. I L-U-V U. I L-U-V U... [SOBBING] Oh, my God, that's our code. Oh, my God... Laura, that's our... [SOBBING] Are you here, mi hija. I am so sorry about all those things I said. I didn't mean them. I was just so angry and so scared to lose you. Please don't hate me. [SOBBING] [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] I love you too, my ladybug. Para siempre, baby.
