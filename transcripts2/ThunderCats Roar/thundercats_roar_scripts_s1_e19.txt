 So are you gonna help us or... - [screaming] Tally-hawk! - [screeching] - This show is weird. - [Tygra snoring] - [rumbling] - Ugh, it's already Wednesday? [cackles] These skycutters are undefeatable! [laughing] Ugh! The Mutants got some dumb flying machines now. Somebody go deal with them. - No. - Nuh-uh. - Not me. - I fought the Mutants last week. Wait! Did someone say dumb flying machines? This is the perfect chance to test out my awesome flying machine! [man singing on TV] ♪ Partly metal, partly real

 [all laughing] Yo, Mutants! Betcha can't catch me! Try to keep up! - [Monkian] Don't mind if we do! - [Vultureman laughing] Uh-oh. [Mutants laughing] [Slithe] We can't miss now... Looks like someone's got tunnel vision. [laughs] Whoa! Ow! My apologies, ma'am. [both grunting] [growling] Mutants. Whoa! Nice wing span! Oh, yeah! Let's go kick some butt! [yelling] [laughs and gasps] Argh! Hey! You're pretty good at punching Mutants. I may have punched some Mutants in my time. Whoo, she's so cool! Yeah? Ever give 'em one of these? Argh! Two Mutants at once? Amateur! [all yelling] They're punching and flirting. This is painful. And socially awkward. Mutants, retreat! [laughs] Mutants are so dumb. I wasn't flirting. Really? That's too bad. I was. Oh! Or maybe I was. [chuckles] I get so in the zone when I'm fighting Mutants. Happens every Wednesday. Wait! The Mutants attack you every Wednesday? They attack my castle every Friday. Oh! Really? That's crazy. You know, since I helped you fight them today, I guess that means you owe me one. Should we say my place? Tomorrow? Midnight? Dinner and some Mutant punching? [announcer reading] Um... Yeah! I'm Panthro, by the way. Barbastella. See you tomorrow, Panthro. [giggling and whooping] [all screaming] - I met somebody! - [all] Yay! Oh, Panthro! Tell us everything. Eh, it's totally cas... But her name is Barbastella, and she is amazing. Barbastella! Who is she? What's her deal? How did you meet? Can I be the best man at your wedding? I met her in the sky! She's got these really cool, big, black wings! And fangs! And get this, she does this cute thing where she eats bugs when she thinks nobody's looking... So, she's a bat-woman? Bat-woman? [chuckles] No. I think she's like a pterodactyl or something. - [communicator beeps] - That's probably her. Hey, Panthro! I never gave you my address. I live in Bat Castle at 2226 Bat Avenue, Bats-ylvania. Or you can just type in "Bats" into your GPS. That'll get ya here. Uh, Barbastella, no big deal... But are you a bat-woman? I didn't want to get into it, but, uh, yeah! I'm Queen of the Bats! Okay. See you tomorrow! Hey, isn't Panthro scared of... [screams] Bats! I totally forgot. I have plans, for the rest of my life! Oh, well! Barbastella will figure it out when she never sees me again! [whimpers] Panthro! You are not ghosting on this girl just because you're afraid of bats. - She could be the one. - She definitely is. I've seen enough romantic comedies to know that incompatible people always fall in love! Just come down from the fridge and we'll help you get ready for this date. I'm good. I live here now. Redirect all of my mail to top of the fridge. Hey, guys, don't pressure Panthro. It's okay to be single. Just look at me! Thirty-three, I'm single and I'm doing great! Ahhh! Help me! - Oh, yeah. - You got it, Panthro! [Cheetara] All right, first thing we gotta do is some exposure therapy. We'll start easy. Here's a bat... [gasping] It was just a picture. I can take it from here, Cheetara. What we need is a romantic comedy scheme. Like the one where the lady adopts a hockey team to prove she can be mayor. Or, or, or the one where the puppet only has 17 hours to marry his true love! [kisses] What movies are you watching? I've got it! Panthro gets scared when he sees the bats... So what if he can't see them? Here, try this. - [coughs] - Perfect! Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good. - [crashes] - Panthro! This is dumb. You can't wear sunglasses on a date. No schemes! Well, I say "yes" schemes! - No schemes! - Yes schemes! - No schemes! - Yes schemes! - No schemes! - Yes schemes! Stop it! I gotta figure this out for myself. I'm going to my garage. - To work on a scheme? - No schemes! [Panthro] Hmm. Thinking... Thinking... [sighs] I got it. Hey, Panthro, would you rather kiss a bat or Mumm-Ra on his dusty old lips? - [Panthro] Neither! - Okay, just thought I'd ask. Anyways, thanks for walking me to my date, guys. I need the support! No worries, dude. I'm just glad you're not going through with Lion-O's lame scheme. Well, you were right, Cheetara. I can't wear sunglasses on a date. It would look rude. So, I made these! Check em' out! Black out contact lenses! I pop em' in and I can't see a thing. But Barbastella will never know. Oh, my gosh! It's a scheme. Oh, by the way, I need you two to lead me around all night. [groans] This is a terrible idea. - [cave bell rings] - Hey, Panthro, lookin' good. [chuckles] Right back at ya, Barbastella. Hmm. Hmm? Panthro, uh... What's the deal with... Oh, yeah. Barbastella, this is Lion-O and Cheetara. They're... - Here for the double date! - What! Cool. Wasn't expecting that but, come on in. The Mutants always attack at dawn, so we've got the whole night. [Cheetara growls] I'm gonna grab my bats. They're super excited to meet you. [giggles] Ugh, Lion-O! Why did you tell her we were dating? False identities! You can't have a romantic comedy scheme without false identities. Ooh! Like the one where the lawyer switches bodies with a newspaper to make it in the big city. These aren't movies! Here come my babies! - [bats screeching] - Babies! They're all tickly! I knew you'd hit it off. Come on. Let me give you the grand tour. ♪ Tour of the castle ♪ Everything Is falling apart ♪ ♪ Panthro can't see anything ♪ And that really Makes things hard ♪ ♪ Oh, no, Oh, no He just hugged Cthulhu ♪ [roaring] ♪ Everybody had a good time ♪ And the tour Of the castle's done ♪ So, Cheetara, Lion-O. How did you meet? Well, um... She was an undercover reporter at the candy museum where I was trying to steal the world's most valuable candy crown! Wow! That sounds like something out of a movie. Seriously! What movies are you people watching? You're lucky you found each other. Third Earth is full of jerks. I should know, I've dated them all. Mole Master, Mad Bubbler, Queen of the Rats... I'm glad to finally find a nice guy like Panthro. Someone who doesn't play games. That's me! Honest Panthro! You know what, it's almost dawn! I should get my bats to sleep before the Mutants show up. Hey, Panthro, wanna tell them a bedtime story? Ha! You kidding? I'd love to. [announcer reading] Oh, oh, I see. Read them a story. Right. Sure. Read them a story, like, uh, I'll use my eyes to look at the words on the page and, uh, say them out loud. Chapter one... A long time ago... - [all screeching] - [whimpers] Quit goofing. They want the real story. Exactly as written. Psst. Panthro! We need a code! How about I pat your back to let you know what the letters are? One pat for "A." Two pats for "B." [grunts] [screeches] Their beady little eyes! Nasty finger wings! - [screeches] - And their tiny little teeth! I hate bats! [whimpering] I hate bats! I hate bats! I hate bats! Panthro, do you want your black out contact lenses back? - [chuckles nervously] Why would I need... - [screeches] [yelping] [whimpering] What's the deal, Panthro? Barbastella, I'm, I'm sorry. I can explain. No time for explanations, Panthro. We gotta deal with these Mutants now. [cackling] - Watch it, Panthro! - Whoa! ThunderCats! Except for Panthro who can't see. Ho! I thought fighting Mutants together would be fun, but it looks like you need to play it safe. Swarm, my children! Swarm! Aw, man! This is the best part of the date! Now I can't even see what's happening. Man, I really let Barbastella down. My babies! I will avenge you. This metal is so strong! Even the Sword of Omens can't penetrate it! Man, I just... I gotta help out. It's time to save my friends... Without the aid of my vision! Sheesh. He's more destructive when he can actually see the bats. [gasps] Bats! Follow me! It's time to face your fear! Thanks, Lion-O, I think you're... [screams] Bats. Bats! Panthro's fear makes him stronger! My children! Swarm with me. - Hey, Panthro! Look, bats! - [screams] Bats! Ahhh! How about a bedtime story for my babies? Babies! Bat babies! [yells continuously] Bats! Ahhh! - [Slithe] Mutants, retreat. - [Panthro continues yelling] Bats. Mommy's okay, thanks, babies. Panthro, why didn't you tell me you were afraid of bats? [Panthro mumbling] Bats are gone. You can look up. I was just sayin', I like you. [sighs] But I thought if you knew I was scared of bats you wouldn't like me. Are you kidding? I want people to be scared of me! I'm the Queen of the Bats, it's all very much on purpose. [chuckles] Well, then you found the right guy! 'Cause I am the most scared of bats! Like, no joke! You wanna know how many times I almost peed my pants tonight? [both laughing] It's time I fessed up, too. Cheetara and I aren't dating! I stole that from the plot of Candy Heart Heist Five. They made a fifth one? These movies cannot be real! Okay, Panthro, I guess it's movie night for date number two! You bring the popcorn and your chiroptophobia! Ooh! Date number two, eh, Panthro? Guess you'll be needing these. Nah. After all that, I think I'm finally over my fear of... [screeches] [screams] Bats! Bats! _ Surf the internet with browser of future osdb.link/brave
