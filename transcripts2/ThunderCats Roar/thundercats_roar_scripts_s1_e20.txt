 Huh? How's it looking? Do we need more smash? I don't know. Check the blueprints. Hmm... M- O- R... Who gave the blueprints to Jackalman? More smash! More smash! This hole needs to be deeper if we're going to plant our seeds. Once we plant the Seeds of Plun- Darr terraforming will begin. We'll make Third Earth exactly like our beautiful Planet Plun- Darr! Huh? The ThunderCats!

 Why can't they just mind their own business? Well, we Mutants won't go down without a fight, yes. Huh? Back. Come back. Now cut the wheel! No! You have space! Where did you learn to park? I didn't. You said you knew how to drive. Parking is the opposite of driving. Grr, Vultureman! Crush the ThunderCats! Okay, boss. Hey, thanks. Uh, there we go. You missed, genius. Uh, sorry, I pressed the wrong button. How did you get in here? Catch me and find out, slow pokes. Remind me which one it is? The Smash button! Smash! Eject? Okay. Hey Slithe, I think the ThunderCats are here. Do you? Good thing I've got a remote control. Whoa! You think I'd let an oaf drive my vehicle without some kind of override? Man, I wish I'd thought of that. Guys, we have to get out of here. Don't unbuckle your seat belts! That's not safe. Gotta stop it! Gotta stop it! - Smash! Smash! Smash! Smash! - Oh, that cannot be good. There. Finally parked. Lion- O look out! I can't control it! It's gonna smash. Huh? Another scheme foiled! Get in the car, doofuses. We'll get you next time, ThunderCats! Tygra, can you believe? you told me not to hold my sword while I was driving Oh, hey, what do you guys think these things are? Seeds of Plun- Darr, eh? I'll take them back to my lab and figure out what those Mutants were up to. Good job, everyone! You should all be proud to call yourselves ThunderCats! Oh, no! I got in the wrong car! I'm stuck with the ThunderCats! Okay, don't panic... I just gotta get outta here before they notice. Oh, no! I forgot to get outta here! Uh, hey guys can I talk to you in the other room for a minute? How long has Jackalman been here? We need to capture him before he attacks us. I don't know, Tygra, I think he just got confused and came home with us by accident. Yeah, isn't he the dumb Mutant? Or, you know, the dumbest Mutant? He's probably all mixed up. Maybe he thinks he's a ThunderCat now. - Aw! - Aw! I don't have the heart to tell him he's not a ThunderCat. Look at him! I bet he can't even think and breathe at the same time. Hehe! They think I'm a ThunderCat! I've infiltrated their base and now I'm an undercover... Now I'm an undercover agent. He's a Mutant. He's probably scheming against us right now. - No way. - No way. Scheming, scheming, scheming... Oh! He didn't catch it. What's the matter, boy? Can't you catch? That's okay. He's still a good boy. Aren't you? Who's a good boy? What do I do? - What should we call him? - His name is Jackalman. - Uh. How about "Jackal- O"? - Or "Jackaltara"! His name is Jackalman. And I'm like 99.9% sure we've heard him talk. He's a troublemaker, but you have to cherish these years. Hey, little buddy, how'd you like to come to my lab? I'm looking at the Seeds of Plun-Darr. Yes. Take me to the Seeds of Plun-Darr, fool! Ow! He really doesn't know how to catch, huh? Whoa! Vultureman did some serious gene editing to these seeds. Good thing we stopped Slithe from planting them. Right, boy? Uh- oh! Come on, buddy! The Wolo Village is being flooded! We have to help, ThunderCats. What do you say, boy? Are you ready to go on your first adventure? - We can't bring Jackalman! - Sure we can. I got a leash. And, uh, here's some plastic baggies. Let's roll! Alright, everybody, the dam is sealed! Now we just gotta save some Wolos! Hop on you guys! Oh, yeah, we're saved! - Uh- oh! - Gotcha! - Help! - Sky Lion- o! Hey, what about us? No Wolo left behind on my watch. - Alright! Yeah! - Nice job guys. That little boy is about to be sucked down a drain! Help! Help! I'll save him. Gotcha! Now to paddle out. Made it worse. Uh... "Righty tighty, lefty loosey." - Uh- oh! - Help! Jackal- O! Save them! Lion- O, for the last time, Jackalman is a Mutant. Oh, no, if I don't save them, they'll know I'm not a ThunderCat and I'll never get the Seeds of Plun- Darr! Oh, thanks, Jackal- Tara! Huh? You did it, Jackal- O! Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Me? A good boy? Good boy, I say! Good boy! Time for more good deeds. Oh, no! - Yay! - Yay! - Yay! - Yay! - Yay! - Yay! Jackal- O! Save them! Here you go, Jackaltara. Gotcha a little present for being so good. Can Jackalkit sleep in our room? Nah, let Jackalthro rest. He's had a big first day as a hero. - Aw! - You'll see him tomorrow. Say goodnight to Jackaltara! - Goodnight, Jackalthro! - Goodnight, Jackalkit! I wonder if I'll ever get to be a Mutant again... ♪ A Mutant once more ♪ ♪ A Mutant again ♪ ♪ With enemies like these ♪ ♪ Who needs a friend? ♪ ♪ A friendship's Not in my repertoire ♪ ♪ They say the world's full of evil ♪ ♪ I wonder where all of them are? ♪ ♪ A Mutant again ♪ ♪ A Mutant once more ♪ ♪ I know I've done good ♪ ♪ But I'm bad to the core ♪ ♪ Like the darkness Lying under the stars ♪ ♪ I used to have dreams About evil ♪ ♪ I wonder Where all of them are ♪ I knew he was scheming against us! And he can talk. He can sing! He sure can! I wish there was a way to get him back home without letting him know we were on to him. I don't want to hurt his feelings. His feelings? - He's a Mutant! - So? You became best buddies with Mumm-Ra that one time and none of us gave you a hard time about that. I was... I was under mind control. - Sure you were. - Hmm... I have an idea! Panthro, where are those evil Seeds of Plun-Darr? Oh! Oh, man, I gotta get those Seeds of Plun- Darr and get outta here. Hey, Cheetara, do you have those Seeds of Plun-Darr we took from the Mutants? Why, yes! Here they are. Whoops! Butterfingers. You're so clumsy. Why don't you just pick them up with your feet? Hey, what's that? Ha- ha! I did it! I did it! I did it! Hey, where's Jackalkat? Turns out he was a bad guy, so we gave him the Seeds of Plun- Darr and let him go. What? - You guys! You guys! - Jackalman? You're back. Welcome back. - Aw. - Where were you? I was with the ThunderCats! I was so scared, I thought they were gonna eat me! I'm so glad you're okay. Wait, hold on. Jackalman thought we were gonna eat him? You guys! You guys! Look what I brought. The Seeds of Plun- Darr? Excellent work, Jackalman! Now the evil terraforming of Third Earth can begin! That's our cue. No! We're too late! You've defeated us, Jackalman! Nice one, Lion- O. It's time for Third Earth to be reborn! Huh? One Plun- Darrian tree? Has someone been messing with these seeds? I don't know anything about that! Looks like my genetic modification did the trick. - Great plan, Lion- O! - Yes. It looks like the Mutants win, thanks to Jackalman! - But it's just one tree. - Which will grow! Third Earth is doomed to become a new Planet Plun-Darr. In a couple centuries, give or take. Curse you, Mutants! So, we did it? Yay! Seriously though. Do the Mutants think the ThunderCats are trying to eat them? Because that's new and weird information that I feel we're just glossing over. Who knows what they think, Tygra. All I know is that for once, it feels good to lose. We're gonna come back later and destroy that tree, right? Oh yeah, it's an invasive species. It's gotta go.
