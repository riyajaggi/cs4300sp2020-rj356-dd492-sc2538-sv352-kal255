 There we go. With those ThunderTank repairs out of the way, I'm done. I can't remember the last time I didn't have anything to fix around here. - [alarm blaring] - [computer] Max speed exceeded! Max speed exceeded! [clattering] Oh! Looks like I'll have to fix the ThunderTread again. [rumbling] And the ThunderFridge. - [meowing] - And the Thunder... Uh, actually, I forgot what Thunder-thing it was. [humming] [screaming] [static]

 And another ThunderSecurity Camera. - What the... - [Lion-O] Panthro. - [screams] - Can you fix my blow-dryer? Oh! Lion-O. Let me see that. There. You're not supposed to get it wet. That's dangerous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I... - Can you fix the refrigerator? - Can you fix the gymnasium? [all talking at once] [chuckles nervously] Okay. Okay. You win. I'll get to work. Thanks, Panthro. How can we ever repay you? The appreciation I get from the team is thanks enough. - Hot! - [electricity buzzing] It's okay, Lion-O. That was an easy mistake to make. [objects clattering] Heh. Sounds like someone just made another job for me. But who? We're all right here. Oh, yeah. That's, uh, that's weird. That's extremely weird. And bad. [alarms blaring] The lair is under attack. ThunderCats, panic! [all screaming] Something drilled through the council room. Something drilled through the weapons room. Someone ate my cake! It's on the roof. Follow me! - [gasps] The rest of my cake? - What? No! The culprit who did this to our base. Oh! Do they have the rest of my cake? No? [stammers] I mean, I don't know. Maybe. Just, uh, forget it. Let's go. Over there. - [all gasp] - Who dat? Oh... I still don't know what that is. Initiating scan. [beeping] [whirring] Must continue search for diamonds. - Stop right there, miscreant. - No. Oh, the miscreants never stop right there. Well, we better stop it quick. That thing is headed for the Thundrillium core! And my bedroom! That's where I keep my stuff. Listen to me. Thundrillium is the fuel that powers the Cats Lair. If that thing drills through the control room and punctures the core underneath, - the entire lair will explode! - [all gasp] Including your stuff. No! ThunderCats HO! He's too fast for us. He's too fast for you. Hey, there. Surprised to see me? Wait. You do see me? Uh-oh. Yeah! This ought to hold him. Whoa! Gotcha! [Wilykit and Wilykat yelling] Hang on. I'll save you! [both groaning] - [both yell] - [thudding] [groans] We shouldn't have eaten that cake. You ate what now? I'm gonna be sick. - [retching] - No! I just showered! He's right above the... [Lion-O sobbing] No! - He's right above the core. - [device beeping] We can stop him together, Tygra. Me with my super-strength and you with your... [balls clatter] Uh, doing your thing. I have a Bolo whip and it's a lot more effective than super-strength. [whip cracks] [clangs] The whip is useless, we're doomed! [grunting] [yells] [grunts] A-ha! The whip has redeemed itself. - [whirring] - Um... Rethinking the whole whip plan. Tygra, let go. - I should... - [Panthro] Let go, Tygra. - Maybe if I just... - Let go of the whip. [whimpers] [whirring stops] Oh, yeah. Bolo whip. Never doubted it. All right, pinhead. Time to talk. Who are you and why are you here? My name is Driller. I'm here to drill. But why? I drill for diamonds. There are many diamonds here, and I need diamonds to sharpen my drill. Without diamonds, my drill would become dull. And I would not be able to drill anymore. You need to drill for diamonds so that you can drill for more diamonds? Correct. That's silly. My shampoo bottle tells me to lather, rinse and repeat. But that doesn't mean I have to keep repeating it forever. You could just stop! If you only drill so that you can keep drilling, you don't need to drill at all! He's right. Just like I don't need to shampoo at all. Well, that's not... Drilling, like shampoo, is completely pointless. Pointless? [Driller powering down] Driller is pointless? Looks like I really helped! You're welcome, everybody. [groaning] Hey, it's not so bad. Look at me. These guys keep breaking my things and I keep fixing them. Break, fix, repeat. It never ends. So, Panthro is pointless, too? No, I... I wouldn't say... [groans] [both groaning] Glad that's over. Who's hungry? I feel completely empty inside! [both groaning and whimpering] [crunching and humming] We need to talk about Panthro. - [grumbles] - Oh, jeez! There goes the floor again. Whew! This is exactly what I'm talking about. It's been a week and he still hasn't fixed anything around here. The lair is a total disaster. I love the new design. - Watch this. - [yells] - [Lion-O laughs and groans] - [Snarf purrs] See how easy it is for me to get to the kitchen? Cheetara, what were you doing in my bedroom? - Just passing through. - [bouncing] - Hey, guys! - What the... [whooping and cheering] [both laughing and whooping] I'm not using the shower, so I used the curtain to make a jump pad. [high-pitched voice reading] [both] Whoo-hoo! This is awesome! - [jump pad rips] - [both yelling] - Ah, they'll be fine. - [yelling continues] I will say, it's concerning that they haven't landed yet, - but... - [crashing] There we go. Totally fine. - [floor rumbling] - [all yell] - [yelling] - [thuds] [all grunting] Someone needs to fix the holes. I haven't seen Panthro in days. What about the Berbils? They've helped us rebuild before. [groans] I tried the Berbils, but they're busy with another project. [Berbils] Ding, ding, ding, ding... [Slithe] Castle Plun-Darr nears completion! These friendly fools will build anything for anyone! - Yes! - [all laughing maniacally] [Berbils laughing] [Berbil] What nice men. Well, someone needs to find Panthro and let him know how important he is to our team. - You're standing on me. - Whoops. We need you back, Panthro. I need you back. My back needs you back. My back, Panthro. My back hurts. What's the point? It's just break, fix, repeat. Break, fix, repeat. It never ends. I'm not important. You are important and I'm gonna prove it. Jump pad! [groans] Taking the stairs. Come on, Panthro. How could you think your life is meaningless? This place is falling apart without you. [sniffs] And what's that smell? It's not me. I'm the only one around here who still showers. [all coughing] It's coming from the reactor room. [all gasp] [in sing-song voice] Breaking some stuff! Yeah, yeah! Jam a bunch of cookies into a vent! Elbow-dropping science! Cut a bunch of wires! Lion-O, what are you doing? [in normal voice] Snapping you out of it. Look, everyone, Panthro is back in action! - Hip hip... - [alarms blaring] You've disrupted the Thundrillium core. This place is gonna blow. Hooray? Let's get down there and stabilize the core. There's too much rock to dig through. There's no time. Unless... [groaning] [narrator] And now back toBuilding with Berbils. Greetings, builders. Today, we are going to build with a drill. [clicking] - Oh, the drill doesn't seem to work. - Oh? Let's see what the problem is. Oh, dear. This drill is completely empty inside, making it pointless. I know how that goes. Now, to put this useless drill where it belongs. [drill thuds] - Driller, we need you to drill. - [groans] I'll handle this. Driller, what is drilling? What is life? These are questions that everyone must... There, I rewired you so that you'll be happy forever. You altered the fundamental core of my identity just to bypass my emotional instability... And I am feeling great about it! - Yeah! - Good. Now, let's ride. Keep going, Driller. [gagging] They're almost at the core. Wait, I thought we didn't want Driller to hit the Thundrillium core. [alarms blaring] [all screaming] The lair's going to explode! What about my stuff? Will it be okay? What? No! Stuff! Well, it looks like we blow up now. [chuckles heartily] But I'm still feeling great about it. Nothing's blowing up as long as I'm around to fix things. [all cheering] He stabilized the core by unstabilizing it in reverse! Now, that's how science works! - Yeah! - [high-pitched voice reading] It was a pleasure working with you, Driller. - Yeah! - [high-pitched voice reading] Before you go, would you like me to rewire you back to normal? No. I feel like I have a new purpose in life. In fact, I would like to return the favor. Driller will rewire Panthro now. [whirring] No, no, no, stop. That's okay, Driller. Unlike you, I don't have any wires. But what we do share is a sense of purpose. If I wasn't around to fix things, this whole place would literally fall apart. So the more things my fellow ThunderCats break, the more useful I become. Get ready to be super useful 'cause while you guys were talking, I broke everything! [all laughing] What? He can teleport? Seriously, what is the point of that guy?
