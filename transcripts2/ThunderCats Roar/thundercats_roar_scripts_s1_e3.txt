 [humming] [alarm sounds] Whoo-hoo! It's time, it's time! It's finally time! Hey, everyone, guess what time it is. It's time to fix that window you just jumped through? [laughs] Way off, Tygra. Time to work on my biceps? [grunts] Nice try, Cheetara. Time to beat this weird old video game? Not quite, Wilykit. Uh, time to beat this weird old video game? Uh, still wrong, Wilykat. [meowing]

 Those weren't even words, Snarf. Time to finish building this addition to the ThunderTank? [both] Huh? Oh, come on, Panthro, it's cookie o'clock! [all] Ooh! ♪ Cookie o'clock! ♪ [all cheering] That's right. And this ain't no ordinary cookie o'clock 'cause I found the last jar of Thunder Snaps! Oh, man, those are the best. ♪ Round like a circle short like a cat ♪ ♪ A touch of spicy sparkle and a thundery snap ♪ [man] Thunder Snaps! Not sold on this planet. Let me just get this lid off here. [straining] This thing won't give. - Hey, uh, Lion-o? - [exaggerated grunting] - Lion-O! - Huh? Need a hand with that? [laughs] Come on, Tygra. Heroes don't ask for help. What are you talking about, Lion-O? There's a call-for-help function built right into the Sword of Omens. Oh, yeah. Its magical powers are only surpassed by the blunt dullness of its plastic blade! Just need a little more leverage. [straining] I'll have this off in just a second... Oh! Oh, who am I kidding? I can't open this jar on my own and cookie o'clock is ruined! No cookies. Only darkness remains. Come on, Lion-O. Just let us help you with the jar. Ah, give it a rest, Tygra. I know what Lion-O needs. - You do? - Sure do. You need to open that jar yourself and be the heroic leader you were born to be. Yeah, I guess that would also solve the problem. Sounds pretty good to me, Cheetara. But, uh, how am I gonna do it? Have you ever heard of the elixir of jar-opening super strength? [vocalizing] [gasps] Where that? [Cheetara] In the soppy swamps of Boggy Ben, the most fearsome swamp beast there ever, ever was. Boggy Ben! I thought he was just an old legend! Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. But, you know, Lion-O, some legends are for real. Whoa! If I go defeat Boggy Ben, then I can get that jar juice, get buff and open the cookie jar! I can still save cookie o'clock! Come on, Cheetara. Let's go get that jar juice. Hey, and if you get in over your head, don't forget to call us for help! [Lion-O laughs] Nice one, Tygra. ♪ Lion-O, the mighty hero ♪ ♪ Doesn't need nobody's help ♪ ♪ 'Cause everybody knows real heroes ♪ ♪ Do it all by themselves ♪ ♪ I can break his branch myself ♪ ♪ I can flip this rock myself ♪ ♪ I wrote this song myself ♪ ♪ I don't need nobody's help ♪ [mimicking electric guitar solo] Oh, hey, Lion-O! Lion-O! - [shrieks] - [splash] Hey, uh, we're here. Hmm? Hmm. [growls] [gasps] Stranger danger. Psst! I will eat your flesh. - Yucko. - [spider screams] - [exclaims] - [croaks] [Lion-O] Aw, it's just a cute little... You're gonna croak out here. [screams] This swamp is spooky! - What're we waitin' for? - [Cheetara] Right behind you, Lion-O. [Lion-O in sing-song] We're gonna get the jar juice! [video game music] - [WilyKit] Yes! Whoa, whoa, whoa! - [WilyKat] Nice one. [automated voice speaking] Aw, come on, Snarf. These old games keep glitching out. Hey, no, Snarf, come on! Let him go, Wilykat. That game was, in fact, the toots. Yeah, but it was also keeping my mind off cookie o'clock. Lion-O better hurry up and open that jar. [Panthro giggling] Man, this is gonna be awesome. Oh, hey, Panthro. What you building? - It's a secret. - [both] Oh, come on, you gotta tell us. - Please. - Please. Okay, I'll tell ya, if you help me finish it. [both groan] Suit yourselves. I guess you'll never find out what this super sweet secret weapon is. "Secret weapon"? Kit, you know Panthro's secret weapons are legendary. I know, Kat, I know! - But, but... - But I don't wanna do work. [both groaning] [man speaking] [both] We'll do it! [screeching] [Cheetara] Come on, Lion-O. What's the hold-up? [Lion-O groans] I'm trying not to fall in the swamp again. [Cheetara] Nah, I think you're chicken. Ha! Yeah, right. This place ain't so bad. Just a little mucky... And dark. Sure are a lot of, uh, skull-themed things around. [chuckles nervously] What's that all about, anyw... Whoa! Hey, is that Boggy Ben's lair? You gotta stay sharp out here in the swamps, Lion-O. [exclaims] I'm coming, Cheetara! Well, I'm back in the muck! Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck. Oh, wait up! [exclaims] ♪ Really, really brave and I'm not afraid Of anything ♪ - Where is she? - [Cheetara] Yo, Lion-O. Hey, what are you doing in that cage? I don't know, man. Just keep your eyes peeled. That thing could be anywhere. Hmm. Whoa! Do you think it was Boggy Ben? Did you see the jar juice anywhere? - Did you, huh? - Look behind you! Oh, boy, the jar juice! - Oh, I misunderstood. - [roars] It's Boggy Ben! Call the ThunderCats, Lion-O! - Just raise the sword over your head... - [yells] - [laughs] Hey, Tygra. - How did you know it was me? Well, looks like you forgot to take the tag off your weird costume. And, uh, speaking of which, why exactly are you showing up in a monster costume right when me and Cheetara are looking for a monster? Oh, what's the point? Sorry, Lion-O, there is no monster. Me and Tygra were just trying to teach you a lesson with this spooky, fun adventure. Hmm. So, you weren't really trapped in a cage? - Correct. - Hmm. And there's no Boggy Ben. You guys were just trying to scare me into calling for help? - Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. - Yep, um, that's... That's it. Aw, that's so sweet! Ah, shucks, it's no big deal. But there's still one thing I don't get. If Boggy Ben is just a legend, then who the toots is this guy? [roars] I guess some legends are for real. [both] So this is Boggy Ben? Then that means the jar juice... - No, I definitely made that part up. - Toots. [snarling] [Lion-O] Hey, should we move? Oh, this guy's strong. Whoa! All right, Boggy Ben. Here I come! - Move it, Lion-O! - [exclaims] Hey, you guys, get out of there! Man, don't worry about it. We got it all under control. [roars] Go, Tygra! All right, let's see how you like my bola! - Nice one! - [laughs] Uh-oh. [grunting in pain] Lion-O, just call for help! What're you talking about? Now he's just got one hand. [laughs] En garde! [exclaiming] He's pretty good with one hand. Ha! Whoa, really good! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Cheetara, get him! This is a terrible idea! [grunts] [laughing] [both] Lion-O, call for help! What is with you guys? Now he doesn't have... [grunts] Any hands! [groans] Well, that's not what I planned. But at least we'll be eaten knowing we're brave ThunderCats, and didn't ask for help like chickens. There's a difference between stubbornness and bravery, Lion-O. And what makes ThunderCats so strong is that we've always got each other's backs, no matter what. Oh, I get it, now. Asking for help is a ThunderCat's greatest strength! Why didn't anybody say so? So, uh, just hold the sword up and say, "Thunder, thunder, thunder," and, uh, "ThunderCats... ho!" Here's the last piece of that secret weapon. Now, will you tell us what it is? [chuckles] Okay. All you gotta do is press the button on this controller here... Oh! [both] What? Ooh, how long has that been there? I guess we will have to test this thing later. [both groan] - In the field. - [both] All right! - We're comin', Lion-O! - [all exclaim] Whoa! All right, Boggy Ben, let's see how you handle all the ThunderCats. Hey, where'd he go? [laughing maniacally] Whoa! Back for more of my bola, eh? No, not more of the paddleball. Why don't you give me a shot? [Boggy Ben groans] Hey, pass that thing over here. You got it. Follow me, big dummy. Ha-ha! - Here you go, Snarf. - [Snarf] Meow! [growls] [WilyKit] Pick on someone your own size. [WilyKat] So, like, not us. Looks like it's time for the finishing blow. [grunting] Once I get up there... [blows] Oh, man, we did it! Yeah, Lion-O. See how much more heroic you can be when you ask for help? You bet. Teamwork is the best! Now, how about you let us open those Thunder Snaps? Oh, yeah, looks like it's finally time for... [man singing] [all cheering] Uh, maybe we can put 'em back together? [sinister voice] Cookie o'clock. It's gonna be okay, buddy. We'll make it through this together. No, Cheetara, all is lost. Unless... Unless I managed to finish that secret weapon you suggested. [both] It was Lion-O's idea? [laughs] Yeah, just in case I totally flubbed it. [both] The secret weapon is a Thunder Snap launcher? [all exclaim] [man singing] [all cheering] I love learning lessons. ♪ Lion-O, the mighty hero ♪ ♪ Just learned a lesson it seems ♪ ♪ Turns out when there's trouble ♪ ♪ All the people can save the day ♪ ♪ They can kick some butts for him ♪ ♪ They can do his chores for him ♪ ♪ They can do everything for him ♪ ♪ He don't gotta finish what he began ♪ No, Lion-O, that wasn't the point. Ah, give it a rest, Tygra. We got our cookies, didn't we? Ha. Yeah, I guess you're right. All's well that... Whoa! Lion-O, look out! Lion-O! Well, I'm back in the muck!
