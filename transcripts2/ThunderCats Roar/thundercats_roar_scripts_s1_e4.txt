 Light up, TV. Stop being dark! Come on, hurry it up. Could have run to the store and bought a new TV by now. Are there TV stores on Third Earth? I don't know, probably. Don't worry, Cheetara. I think I got it. - [thud] - All right, Lion-O, we tried hitting it, - but it's time to break out the old... - [gasping] Television manual. Yeah! Check out the schematics. - Ooh! - Ah-ha! I was just hitting it with the wrong thing. - And to think we almost read a user manual. - [music playing] That would have been super boring.

 - Faster. - [WilyKat] Speaking of super boring, that show looks real snoozy. - We're gonna explore outside. - So long, geezers. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Pretty dangerous out there for a couple of kids. I bet Lion-O would love to be your chaperone. [gasps] Heck yeah, I would! [both] No way, that stinks! Wait. Why'd you say your thing? This'll be fun. Just us cool kids hanging out, getting into trouble. Fun stuff! Not if you're a chaperone. Chaperone means you're an adult. Yeah, it means, you're basically the same as Tygra. [gasping] [snap] [whimpers] You take that back! Oh, come on. You can do worse than being like me. [mockingly] No, I couldn't. No one could. [normal voice] Let's go, kittens. You sure you wanna send baby king out to watch them? Baby king? I'm basically a man. It's not like being an adult comes with a manual or something. [giggling] Ugh, Tygra... I'm out. Bye! Now that it's just us cool guys, you'll see, Snarf and I know all the funnest stuff to do out in the wilds. I don't know. Oh, yeah? Well, how about surfing the Jade Lagoon! Eh, this is all right. Swinging across a bottomless gorge! Probably has a bottom. [chuckles] And then I arm-wrestled the caveman, and he gave me the time capsule. What? That's crazy! You know, Lion-O, you almost make being a chaperone seem cool. - Almost. - Almost? Oh, yeah, getting close, Lion-O. Now, what do you say we ride razor slugs from Double Bass Mountain? What's that? [Lion-O] Uh, let's see here. "Danger! Evil! Bad stuff inside." Well, we oughta leave that alone. - [Snarf] Mmm... - Okay, whatever you say... Tygra! [annoyingly] I never walked though an evil door! - Let's go! - [both] Whoo-hoo! Lion-O rules! [purrs] [Lion-O] Hmm. Spooky crystal. That does actually look like bad stuff. - So... - Oh, what does it do? - I wonder if you have to... - [crystal rings] - [both] Ooh! [laughing] - [crystal rings] [both] Do the sounds. Do the sounds. Do the sounds. Careful now. We don't have a manual for this thing. [annoyingly] I just love manuals! [chuckles nervously] Not that I'd ever wanna read a manual. Do evil crystals even have manuals? [crystal rings] [Mumm-Ra] Who dares call the tomb of Mumm-Ra? Oh, I think we called someone. Uh, hello? Hello? Uh... Go for Mumm-Ra. [growls] - What gives, Snarf? - I think Snarf is right, guys. Mumm-Ra is that gross evil creep who used to rule Third Earth. [both] Until we kicked his bony butt? - Uh, right. - [Mumm-Ra] Is anyone there? Did someone just call my butt bony? Uh, yeah, it is I, uh, the evil plumber. Oh! It's about time you got back to me. My cauldron's been leaking all day. What are you doing? [whispering] We're prank calling him. This'll be great. [whimpers in delight] Mmm-mmm-mmm. Oh, quit acting like Tygra, Snarf. Have you tried [giggles] unscrewing your cauldron's legs? Unscrew the legs? All right... I'll just loosen this one, and... - [thud] - Ow! It fell on my foot, and now my potions have spilled. - I... I think it's seeping through my floor. - [all laughing] Okay, okay, that cinches it. You are the best chaperone ever. [squeals] High-five! [Mumm-Ra] Wait! You're not the evil plumber. You sound more like... ThunderCats. - Uh-oh. - You fool! [kittens screaming] Lion-O, help! Kittens! [Snarf meowing] [evil laugh] I've been looking for this crystal for centuries. And here you led me right to it. Wait a second. The crystal makes phone calls and teleports? I don't know how this thing works. It's not like it comes with a manual. Where are WilyKit and WilyKat? I said I don't know! But I hope it's somewhere awful. All I know is that by sunset, I'll have absorbed enough evil from the crystal to restore my full power and overthrow the planet! [laughs evilly] Oh, yeah? We'll see what the Sword of Omens has to say about that! Hey, where'd he go? - Looking for me? - Ah, nuts! He's in the sky. The one place I can't go. [chuckles] Well, thanks for the thing, dufus. I'm outta here! - Aw, come on! - [Snarf coughing] I'm supposed to be the best chaperone ever! [laughs evilly] Bingo! That lightning is centered right over Mumm-Ra's dumb pyramid. Let's go save them kittens! Before Tygra finds out. Oh, boy, this is not good. What's going on, Panthro? - [Panthro] See that? - [beeping] It's an electrical build-up centered on Mumm-Ra's pyramid. [electrical shock] If this keeps up, it could tear the planet apart. Uh, I really don't wanna lose a second planet. Yeah, probably make us look pretty bad. Looks like we better go stop whatever it is then. [all] Yeah! I'm just glad Lion-O and the Thunderkittens are safely away from the danger. Ha! As if this whole thing doesn't scream "Lion-O flubs it again." Okay, this is it, Snarf. Hey, Mumm-Ra, give us back those Thunderkittens, or else, uh... I don't know, we'll think of something. [laughs evilly] Foolish boy, I thought you'd stop by. Too bad I'm way up here, and you're dumb. That's what you think. This time, I'm prepared for you to be in the sky. - Ah! Lion-O! - [clang] Oh! - Wha... - [Mumm-Ra] Oh, hey. Looks like I'm so close to full power that your sword can't hurt me anymore. - [laughs evilly] - [Lion-O groans] You haven't won yet, Mumm-Ra! [chuckles] Hey, guys. Lion-O? You're supposed to be watching the Thunderkittens. Told you he'd flub it. [stammers] No, I can explain. I was watching them, but I'll get them back, I promise. Enough! I command silence! [all screaming] - [stuttering] Guys? - You like that? One of my new powers. Now, if you miss those Thunderkittens so much, why don't you join them? [yelling] [WilyKit] Hey, is that Lion-O? - Kittens? - Lion-O. - Hey, sweet. You're here. - Where are we? Another temple dealy I think. But this one's underground or something. - We can't get out. - But, now that you're here, we can call the other ThunderCats with the Sword of Omens, right? - Right? Right? - Right? I don't have a plan. And we can't call the others because Mumm-Ra turned them to stone. What? We're trapped here forever? You mean, we'll never surf the Jade Lagoon again? Or find out if the bottomless gorge has a bottom? [sobbing] And it's all my fault! I wanted to prove a chaperone could be fun, but the main job of a chaperone is knowing not to mess with evil crystals! You know, like... Like this one. [blowing noses] Can I have a tissue? [blows] Where'd you get these? This old book we found. [gasps] At last, the ritual is almost complete. My full power shall be restored the moment the sun sets. Give or take a few minutes, I think. You know, it actually would be nice to have a manual. You mean, this manual? What? That's right. It turns out the crystal leads to another crystal. And that one still has the user manual. [exclaims] It doesn't matter. You can't stop the ritual now. [laughs evilly] [clears throat] You're clearly too late. Hey, Crystal. This is Crystal. How may I help you? Ooh, voice activated. That's fun. Delete all evil functionality. Deleting evil. No! No! No! My power! - Hey! - [all exclaim] You geezers done with your nap? Let's get that crystal. ThunderCats HO! No! Stop! Hard reboot. [stammers] Activate backup evil? [WilyKit] Eat smoke bomb, Mumm-Ra! [groans] - It's time for your mummy butt-spanking. - Ah! [exclaims] I'll teach you to spank a mummy! Gimme that crystal. No, no, no, no, no. Curse my clammy hands! Gotcha! Sorry, Mumm-Ra. You should have read the manual. [crystal shatters] [screaming] We did it! My cauldron! My crystal! My carpet! You Thunderjerks will pay for this. Hey, Dumb-Ra, I know a fantastic evil plumber if you need one. [laughs] Nice one, dude. Ha-ha. Now let's get outta this dump. Hey, good job. I mean, bad job at first, but then, good job. I'm just glad everyone is safe and Lion-O learned a valuable lesson. I sure did. Don't mess with evil crystals just to look cool. That'll have to do. Unless you already read the manual. Then you can prank Mumm-Ra all day. [both] Yeah! Best chaperone ever! Huh? What? [closing theme music playing]
