 Didn't we just deal with them? - ThunderCats, HO! - [all weakly] HO. Have some more smoke bomb. You'll never defeat us, Mutants. [groans] Stop it. [laughs] That takes care of them. [mutant sighing grimly] I don't know. Maybe if we make this decoy Snarf... Not on our watch, Mutants. ThunderCats, HO! Okay, here we go, fighting Mutants again. Ow! Ow! Ow! [both groan weakly] Sheesh. I better get out of here. [both snoring] Have it the... [sighs] Well, that takes care of them. Let's go, Snarf. Huh? Oh. [grunts] Okay, new plan. Oh, come on. We haven't even left yet. [sighs] You know what? Come on. - [all groan] - This is fine. [laughs] That takes care of them. [laughs] That was great. Those Mutants didn't know what hit them. Whoa! Hey, what's with you guys? [Tygra] We're burned out is what, Lion-O. All we do every day is fight bad guys. It's exhausting. Yeah, I'm sick of fighting, and I love fighting. That's how bad this is. We're running off to do battles so often, I don't even bother putting the Thundertank in park anymore. Hmm. I know what we need. A summer fun beach day! - Great idea, Lion-O! - Let's all go to the beach. Whoa! Hold on! If we're gonna have a summer fun beach day, I need you all to promise no fighting. Yeah, sure. That's the whole point. I mean it. No matter what kind of crazy things we might meet, or what kind of evil schemes someone might have, no fighting today. Promise? - [Panthro] Sure, we promise. - [WilyKat] You got it. [man] Promise! Great! Then, let's go! [all cheering] [upbeat music playing] ♪ Well, we're driving To the beach ♪ ♪ Hope to get there fast ♪ ♪ 'Cause when The surf's in reach Gonna have a blast ♪ ♪ Have some fun in the sun ♪ ♪ Fight no one ♪ [laughs] ♪ Oh, now we're at the beach Got groovy plans ♪ ♪ As you'll hear from each ♪ ♪ Gonna get a tan ♪ ♪ Gonna spike a ball ♪ ♪ Gonna have a float ♪ ♪ Gonna lay a towel ♪ ♪ Gonna dig a moat ♪ ♪ Oh, a summer fun day And we won't fight ♪ Guys! ♪ We're gonna catch some rays ♪ Ow! [yelping] Why are you [yelps] just standing there? What happened to our no fighting summer fun day, Tygra? You promised. I'm not trying to fight him. And the Crabman just attacked me. We did promise, Tygra. Besides, this is probably just a misunderstanding. You probably just want to be friends, don't you, Crabguy? Uh, Crabman? [groans] [both grunt] Ooh! Look at that seashell. [groans] - Guess it's our turn. - [both groan] Oh, now you've gone and done it. You're crab salad, Crabmen. - Stop! - [all] What? Guys, what are you doing? We all promised not to fight today. You're breaking a promise. They started it. [grunts] I don't care. This is a big beach. I'm sure if we just ignore these Crab people, they'll leave us alone. - [all agreeing] - [groans] Hmm. Maybe a little less sand up top. Bingo! My castle! [sighs] What an ignorable thing to do. I guess I could always rebuild it. [yelps] Right in the center. Okay, Snarf, get ready. When they return the ball, I'll bump it to you, you send it back to me, and I'll spike it over. - Got it? - Uh-huh. - [laughs] Fat chance. - Spike! Volleyball, HO! What? Hey! Uh, okay, then. - Guess we'll call that a do-over. - [claws snapping] That's fine. Whatever. We don't need a net to play. Actually, we're done playing volleyball, but because we want to be. Now, this is how you do a summer fun day. Oh, you surf, do you? Well, see if you can keep up with this. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Oh, yeah, I'm unstoppable. Whoa! Whoo-hoo! That was awesome. You've got some real moves, Crabby. [groaning] Sure is a relaxing day at the beach. [claws snapping] [chuckles nervously] Uh, hey, there, everyone. Just doing some, uh, sunbathing. Oh, [chuckles nervously] I'll just go back this way. Nah, here's fine. Just a little sunscreen. [shrieks] Not the face! Huh? Oh. Um, actually, could you get the face? After you've finished my back, of course. Ah, that's great. - Thanks. Oh, okay. - [thumping harder] That's getting a little hard. It's getting harder! Too hard! Much too hard! Oh, no! [coughs] [claws snapping] [all groaning] Well, it wasn't exactly the summer day I envisioned. But we should still feel good, not physically, of course. - Definitely not. - I can't feel my face. But we should be proud that we kept our promise and didn't fight, no matter how much the Crabmen punched us, or kicked us, or slapped us, or pushed us around, or made us eat our beach towel. [coughs] And sand. [Lion-O] And so much sand. So, let's put that all behind us with a good old-fashioned sing-along. [clears throat] Oh... Hello. - Oh! - Come on, Lion-O, give it up. - Summer fun day is over. - I know. So, there's nothing keeping us from putting these crabs back in their shells. - You mean... - ThunderCats, HO! Time for some payback. [grunting] Ah-ha! Oh. [yells] [grunting] No, there's just too many of them. [yelping] [laughs] I think I can handle a crustacean or two. Or three or... [yelps] [groans] [shrieks] [Wilykat] Smoke bombs. - The smoke bombs do nothing. - [both scream] My little whip will teach ya. Uh-oh. [screams] No, not the sunscreen. Not the sunscreen! [screaming] It's no use. There's too many of them. - Where's Panthro? - [coughing] I've seen some stuff, man. Looks like this is the end for us. I'm sorry I ever suggested a beach day in the first place. Leave us alone. We're just trying to have some fun. Hey, they stopped. Ugh! He hugged me! [crying] I did? Why'd you have to go and do that? You hugged him, after all the nice stuff we've done for you. Nice stuff? What are you talking about? You spent the entire day beating on us. - Mercilessly. - Uh, yeah. But fighting is how Crabmen makes friends. Don't you know anything? We was so excited when you showed up. I can't remember the last time we had new friends to fight. Hold on, tiger sharks. It turns out you're huggers. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Before, when you pulled off my eyebrows, that was you being friendly? Uh, yeah. [both chuckle] [all] Hmm. Typical violence doesn't work on these guys, then... [all gasp] [Thundercats] Nice fight! I'm gonna hug you. Ugh! Yuck! Looks like you could use a back rub. Ooh! This shade of blue - looks great on your claw. - No! Hey, Crabbies, I've got something for ya. - A fruit basket. - [gagging] Now, it's time to wrap things up with a nice, fuzzy scarf. [all grunting] - I hope you like it. - [snarls] - Don't you look at me! - Don't touch me! Behold the might of my friendship rainbow. I love you all. [all screaming] Now, that was one fight we can all feel good about. - Let's go home. - Yeah, I'm done with the beach. - Yeah, this place stinks. - I'm over it. [toots] Goodbye, beach. And see you next time, Crabmen. Hey, look at that. Is that the Mutants going to the beach? [Mutants singing] ♪ We're going to the beach and we're gonna have fun ♪ Come on! We deserve some summer fun for all those beatings we take. Who are you? I think the Crabmen are about to meet some friends they're really going to get along with.
