 I've felt like a coward my whole life. You put seven kilos of coke in my car. Yeah. I wasn't brave enough to come here with Axel. Good afternoon. Papers, please? Papers? Okay. Let's go. - What? - Put your foot down. What are you gonna do? Well, for starters, I'm going to stop running away from problems

 that were my fault in the first place. Now. Okay. Okay. Where's the coke? - Where's the coke? - Uh, it's in my bag. In the boot. Fuck! Shit! Fucking stitches have ripped. What the fuck is it doing here? I took it from Marcus so he'd talk about Axel. I was dealing with that in the fucking pool. Get a fucking move on! Be brave... little sis.

 Okay. Take the next bend as fast as you can. Okay. Shit! Oh! Again. Oh, fuck! Now the fucking plastic's broken. Oh, I'm sorry, I should have said. Oh, you knew? Fucking hell, fuck my life! They're right behind us. Here, use this. How the hell did you know where this was? - Does it matter? - Ah, fuck. Oh, shit. - What now? - They've blocked the road up ahead. Oh, fuck. Switch off your bloody phone. Where the hell did you learn to drive like that? Manchester. Hey. What's goin' on? I'm going to Ibiza for a while, little sis. But how come? If this is about Dad, just get a place with Marcus. Yeah, I know. But Ibiza's where it's at, Zo. All the best dance music, house music. All the best DJs. That's the place to be. Come on. Let's pack your bags, you're comin'. Come on, hurry up. We've gotta go before Dad gets back. Wait a minute. - Dad doesn't know? - Nope. How are we gonna get there? - What about school? - Don't worry about school. I'm sure there are schools in Ibiza. This one? Okay, but I can't speak Spanish, and Dad's not well. Axel, wait. Listen, Zo, I'm not leaving without you. You and me, we come together. We're like a package. So be brave... little sis. I don't think I can be. I don't want to run away from home, Axel. I don't want Dad to come back and find nobody here. It would break his heart. And I'm only 15. Come here. Listen. It's not gonna be easy at first, livin' at home with zombie Dad. But I'll write... and I'll call you. And the day you turn 18, I'll be here with a ticket to take you with me. When we saw the checkpoint, we just freaked out. The truth is, we'd taken some pills. The tests have come back negative for drugs and alcohol. They must have sold us some crap, Lieutenant. Huh. They cheated us. What the fuck are you talking about, Boxer? You expect me to believe someone would sell you bad pills? Don't fuck with me. We got them at one of the Martínez family's clubs. You know what they're like, you can't trust them. Tell that to the judge, okay? I'm charging you with reckless driving and disobeying the authorities. These are serious charges. You could be facing two to five years in prison. You're a foreigner, so they will make a quick decision. You must report here every three days until the hearing. I need your address. - Um... - Uh, take mine, Your Honor. The court will keep your passport. You can go. You're bleeding. It was a diving accident. A harpoon. First they sell you bad pills, then you shoot yourself with a harpoon like an idiot... You're getting old, Boxer. Mum. Mum. The investors are deserting us, all of them. The British, the Las Vegas Murdoch guys, Carson Resorts. Everyone. What are you talking about? There are stories in the newspapers about the body found on our land. They don't want to be associated with us. That son of a bitch Axel Collins carries on fucking us even after he's dead. No one's going to fuck anything, calm down. Have you spoken to your father? Dad doesn't pick up the phone or look me in the eye, Mum. Speak to the investors. You're the CEO, Oriol. Convince them we are honorable. Sure. Everything will be okay, do you hear? Yes. Come here. You're too upset, Oriol. Tell me... do you know who did it? Do you know who could have killed Axel? Yes, perhaps. I need to be out by tomorrow morning. Uh... It's urgent! Just... uh, give me a local anesthetic. Emergency contact? Family, friends? I don't have any family, right? No one. Come on, harpoon girl. Fuck... Hey! Gah! Hey! Zoe. Oh, fuck... What have you done with it? What's happened? They broke me tibia in two places. What the hell were you thinkin'? I'm sorry, I just wanted to find out the truth about Axel and... What the fuck? - I told you everything I know! - Hey. - Marcus... - Hey. Let her go, okay? This crazy bitch stole drugs from the fucking Romanians. Look, if I don't have the coke, plus interest, by tomorrow, they're going round to Matilda's school. Do you get it? They're coming for my daughter. - Hey. I told you to let her go, okay? - Ow! Sir? Sir? You have an exposed fracture. We are taking you to surgery. You've still got it though, right? Um, well, not exactly. - What? - But I know where it is, so don't worry. - Oh, fuck! - I'll get it. Oh, fuck! Shit. They have to be here somewhere. Hey. Shall we clean up the place a bit? If the vacuum's here, the drugs must be. Come on. Who's gonna take packets of cocaine - from the middle of nowhere? - This is Ibiza. It could be anyone. The officer who caught us, a farmer, - that cyclist over there. - Hola. Uh... - Hi, Mike. - Oh... Hey. How are you? Um... I'm just... uh, out having a walk in... the forest. A bit early, isn't it? Uh, yeah, just... wanted to do a bit of exercise. Has Jenny left for school already? She stayed at Laura's last night. Oh, no, Mike. Not on a school night. Well, they said they had some work to do. Don't worry about it. I'm on it, okay? How come you haven't called? You need your space. I know that. And I trust you to call me if anything happens. Thank you, Mike. What you're doing makes me proud, Zoe. Can I call you later? - Okay. - Bye. Are you seriously doing that? Well, I haven't done it for years, but my fucking leg hurts. I'm really stressed out. Well, I'm stressed out as well. I'm here trying to find out who killed my brother, but instead I'm stood in a forest, trying to find seven packets of fucking cocaine. And, by the way, waiting to hear whether or not I'm going to prison for two years. Do you think Marcus had anything to do with what happened to Axel? If I had to bet, I would say no. So why did you try and drown him in the pool? Bit of coke? I've screwed up Marcus's life, and you're offering me a line of coke? No, I don't do that kind of thing. Really? Not even a spliff? - No. - Pills? - No - Prozac? Aaah. What? Diazepam? Lithium? Be brave... little sis. I don't think I can be. Sorry. Um... Sorry if I offended you. It doesn't matter. I wanted to ask Marcus about Oriol Calafat. Oriol and Axel had been very close, until suddenly everything went to shit. How come? Well, they had some... minor disagreements. Someone burned down one of your brother's clubs. Axel told me he thought it was Oriol. - Wait, my brother told you that? - Yeah. But you said you didn't know him. I knew him a bit. I met him the first time he came into the Calafat house. Long distance? Yeah, I haven't got a mobile. I need to get a mobile. It's... personal. Do you mind? No problem, mate. - Thanks. - Let's go out to the party. All right, our kid? Axel! How's it going in Ibiza? Ah, Zo. It's epic. Like, you wouldn't believe this place I'm in. I can't believe it's only been three days. Oh! It's mad. Owners are a pretty big deal round here. They've got servants. So, what, you're, like, living there? No, I'm not living here. No, not yet. It's just a party. It's got six bathrooms. Two swimming pools... Seriously? I'm serious. And a church. Well, it's a chapel, but it's in the house. And I'm mates with their son, Oriol. - Making yourself at home? - Oh, he's here. Is this Axel's girlfriend? No, I'm his sister, Zoe. - Be nice. - Your brother is very talented. We're going to do big things together. When are you coming out to see him? Um... I don't think my dad will let me. Well... hurry up, because we're having a party tomorrow at the beach. You should come. A kiss! I need a beer. You see? People here are great. Hey, on Thursday, we're doing an Amadeus night at one of their clubs. That's so cool, Axel. Oh, shit. Zo, listen. I've got go. Call you soon. Love you. I love you. You shouldn't come into my house so wet. Shit, no, sorry. Hi. I'm Axel. Axel Collins. Conchita. I'm a DJ. I'm playing one of your clubs. Just a session, so... Make sure you play well. Then maybe they'll give you another go. Hey, can I ask you a question? Whose music's that? That's my opera collection. Wow. You've got Lucio Silla. You like Mozart? Do I like Mozart? Are you kidding? Mozart... Mozart's the man. Do you know how hard this is to find? To be honest, I haven't ever listened to that one. What? That's criminal. Do you mind? Of course. Phew! This overture is savage. First, the opening bars. Then... here it comes... Can you hear that? Allegro. It's pretty much techno. Darling. This is Axel, a friend of your brother's. This is my daughter, Kika. - Hi. - Hi. I can't study with so many people here. I'm joining the party. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪ ♪ We're here to pull ya ♪ ♪ Back in to do it all the same ♪ ♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Do it long, long, doin' it long ♪ ♪ Do it fine, fine, doin' it fine ♪ ♪ Goin' in, out, goin' in, not out ♪ How are you? ♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah ♪ ♪ Not here to praise ya ♪ ♪ Just here to raise ya An' fill ya full of nails ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah ♪ ♪ Hallelujah... ♪ Kika! ♪ Aún sincero esa story ♪ ♪ Sabiendo el peligro, vine a ti ♪ ♪ Historias de espina ♪ ♪ Me he clavado una espina Te he clavado la mía, no la puedes sacar ♪ ♪ No la puedes sacar All the way from the start ♪ ♪ No soy María, María ♪ ♪ Aún baby, baby, baby ♪ ♪ Dímelo, dímelo ♪ ♪ Aún baby, baby, baby ♪ We're waiting for you at the table.

Are you trying to provoke me? Provoke you? You trick me into leaving Miami, then at a dog's funeral, you tell me my brother or mum might be killers. Come on, Dad, if that's not provocative, I don't know what is. I couldn't tell you on the phone. Do you think they killed Axel? I don't know yet. Fuck, Dad... Look, I really don't care. They're nothing to me. I only come here for two days at Christmas and by the third, I want to shoot them. But what really kills me is how long it took you to realize who they are. No, I have suspected things aren't right for some time. That's why I want you to be brave and take over the company, Kika. Brave? I'm not one of your employees, Dad. I have a life in Miami, I'm going to be an actress. What do you want me to do? Drop everything and be your CEO? You sent me to Boston when I was 17. You abandoned me, Dad. I wanted to... walk the dog with you. Get almonds from the trees. It was better you weren't here. Not being with my dad was better for me, was it? It wasn't just running hotels anymore. Suddenly we ran the nightlife in Ibiza. A world of drug dealers and whores. People disappeared and nobody asked questions. I didn't want my little girl to realize that I was no better than any of them. Well, thanks very much, Dad, but that's the exact reason you can't expect me to come back. I'm flying back tomorrow. Hmm? Okay, Kika. Okay. Come on. Let's eat. Boxer. How much does it cost to buy seven kilos of cocaine? Are we talking wholesale or retail? Whichever's cheapest. I could get it for... 280 grand. Are you going out? Ah, Parrot Beach. - There's a party at eight. - You're going to a party? Sure, it's a party, but it's also my job. My shift starts in half an hour. Have you seen Marcus' leg? What are they gonna do to him if he can't return the drugs? Scoop out his eyes with a spoon? Rape his daughters? Have you got no principles? You say that you read books and that you're really sensitive, but the truth is you don't care about anybody but yourself. You are the one who took the cocaine. You fucked up that guy's life, so if anything happens to his daughters, - it's not on me, it's on you. - I thought that you suspected him! I didn't know what else to do. Do you want to know... why I took lithium, Boxer? When my brother disappeared, I felt like I'd been... hit by a truck. I didn't speak for months and I... I just wanted to die. I don't handle problems well. One doesn't handle problems, Zoe. One tears them out of the fucking ground, so they don't blow up in your face. What are you doing? Boxer? Where are you going? To sort out this mess. Just wait here. When my brother asked me to come to Ibiza, I chose to stay. To live a safe life in Manchester. Maybe that was just an excuse, and actually I was just scared. Then when he disappeared, I tried to kill myself. Is there anything more cowardly than that? - Hello? - Hi, Marcus. It's Zoe. How are you? What, besides the fact that my leg's got a piece of fuckin' metal stickin' out of it? So why don't you just tell me where my fuckin' drugs are? I'm... I'm really sorry, but I... I haven't found them. Um... perhaps if they gave us a bit more time, - then I could get the money. - What time is it? Uh, it's seven o'clock. You'd better get the hell off this island. Because when I get out of here, I am gonna fucking hunt you down. Room 212. Quick! Something's going on. Ow. Where's me stuff? Try to calm down, Mr. Ward. The anesthesia takes time to work. No, no. I've gotta go. Call the doctor. We need more sedatives. No. No more sedative, right? Just... take it off. - ♪ Everyone ♪ - I need to call my family. You said you didn't have any. I lied. Ah... You are really startin' to piss me off. Give me my fucking mobile. - Don't. Don't you dare. - ♪ Everybody knows the pain ♪ Go. Go! Shit. Boxer, mate. You've gotta help me out. Marcus, it's Zoe. - Boxer's not here. - Oh, fuck... Oh, fuck. I've got one hour before they come for me daughters. Comprende? Okay, look, don't worry. Nothing's gonna happen to them. Just tell me where they are and I'll go and get them. Right, Matilda leaves judo in half an hour. Tanny will be there to meet her. It's the British College, right? Take both of them to... to... Formentera, to the mainland, I don't care. Oh, and whatever you do... don't tell their mother. Kika. - Hey, Zoe. Hi. - Have you got a car? - Yeah, I have a car. What's up? - Could you give me a lift? I came to say goodbye to Boxer, because I'm leaving tomorrow. Boxer's not here.

Cristóbal! Cristóbal! Cristóbal! Cristóbal! Nothing's going to happen to him. The crime has expired. But I know it was him. And I need him to acknowledge it. We're having problems with the casino investors. And I'm... And I'm... losing my father's respect. They say that kid was taken across the Mediterranean to Almeria. And buried in the desert, leaving no trace. A perfect crime. You think this moron could commit a perfect crime? His mother says he's an artist. You know what I see? An idiot whose brain has been fried by cocaine. A piece of shit who will squander my businesses on whores and pills after I die. Look at me. I'm nearly 70 years old and I'm still training dancers and even choosing which oil they're going to use on their arse. I'd give my right arm for my son to take over my business, and for him to have had the balls to kill the English kid 20 years ago. That prick was fucking up all our lives, the Martinezes' and the Calafats'. I didn't kill Axel, Pepe. Well. As you said... the crime has expired. Besides, who even cares about that kid anymore? I do. I care. Uh, sorry to interrupt. Um, I just need to collect, uh, Matilda Ward. Well, there's 15 minutes left. Wait outside, please. Okay, we have to wait. I don't think you can smoke in here. I'm an adult. What are they gonna do? Put me in detention? Bring it on. Last time, they expelled me for a week. No, thank you. Gave up years ago. You know it's not tobacco, right? Once, I did it with your brother over on those mats. Oh, my God. You had sex with my brother in this gym? What is the craziest place you've ever done it? I don't know. - My dad's bed. - What? That's not even that crazy. Unless your dad was in the bed. I don't want any blood or violence. No cutting off fingers or anything like that. Huh? Just make it all very polite. I don't want any problems with his family. What do you want to know? I want him to confess what he did. Film him saying he killed Axel Collins. That's all. And after? After? Afterwards, just let him go and let him carry on polluting the world with his shitty music. Understood. Yeah, yeah, yeah! I'll be back soon! But I'm leaving you in good hands. Eh? Give it up for the American queen of house! Whoo-hoo! I'll be right back! Keep on flying, people! Hey! Hey! I'm in here, for fuck's sake! Hey! I'm in here, you sons of bitches! Hey! You sons of bitches! Get me out of here! Get me out of here! Keep moving. I slept with Sissy last night. You know her, right? She's pretty. Lately, I've been going for women. But I don't know anymore. I guess having some chaos in your life, when you're 20, it's okay, but... I'm almost 40. Maybe I should have a baby. - What, a baby with Sissy? - Hmm. All my life, I've always started new things. Magnet therapy. Abstract painting. Acting. Same thing with relationships, you know? I've fallen for so many different people. And you always think it's gonna be the one, but deep down inside, you know it's not. And here we are today, picking up a girl from school. Maybe that should be my life. Doing normal things. Let's go. We're here for Matilda. I told your friend ten minutes. Yes, but I'm her aunt, you see, and she has a head full of lice. So you don't want to have her be in contact with other children. Adiós! I don't think having head lice is going to make me very popular. Mmm. I'm sorry, sweetie. Where the fuck are you going? - We're going to Formentera? - Yay! Formentera! I'm not going. Let me out. - I don't even know you. - Yes, you do. - I'm a friend of your father's. So is she. - I don't care. I'm calling Mum. No, you're not. Your father asked us to take you on a little trip. Just us girls. Somewhere nice that we can enjoy and everyone's just getting a little bit stressed out right now. Stop the car! Stop the car! - It's our dog. It's Pancho. - What? - That is their dog. - Stop! Stop the car! Please be careful. - God! - Ay! Oh, God! Jesus! Pancho! Pancho! Pancho! Oh! Oh! Mwah! Are you okay? - What the fuck? - Girls? They're running away. Girls! Girls? Standing there... in the middle of the forest, I realized that I've had it all wrong. I thought Axel was the brave one and I was the coward. But he ran away... and I stayed. And let me tell you now, that wasn't the easy option. I took responsibility and I think that's... I think that's brave. This has to stop. What do you mean... stop? How am I supposed to protect two girls from a couple of Romanian traffickers? It's time to be brave. Don't you think? Are you ready, Mrs. Walker? Get me out of here! Hey! Hey! Get me out of here! What the fuck are you doing? Do you know who I am, you fucking morons? What the fuck is that? You'd play great sets on this. Why don't you give it a try? Fuck off. Take me back, now! You're going to look into the camera and tell me the truth. What truth? It's a simple question. Did you kill Axel Collins? What are you talking about? Kill Axel? Of course not, arsehole! Well, someone told us you said something different a long time ago. Twenty years ago. Don't you remember? Don't worry, I'm sure the music will bring it all back. Turn that down, for fuck's sake! Okay, guys, okay, okay. Yeah! We've all had a good laugh. Let me go now. I didn't kill Axel! You have no fucking idea what you're doing! I'm Pepe Martínez's son! You're fucking up the rest of your goddamn lives! What are you doing here, Boxer? We're about to head out. Let me up, boys. You look nice. Going to a party? What the fuck do you want? I wanna know what the fuck is going on, Yuri. Seven large packets of cocaine turned up in a pine forest today. - I thought they might be yours. - They're Marcus's. Someone took them from him. - What are you planning to do? - What do you think? Yeah... Jesus! What the fuck do you catch with this? Put it down. Now. Okay, no problem. Hey. You got any coke? There is a ban. Remember? It's just for me. I had my first line in eight years. And I could use a little more. Come on, guys. Just give me something and I'll head off. Huh? There's a good boy. You've even got beer. This is better than a yacht. Ah. Aah. Oh, shit. Hang in there. What the fuck? Hey! Hey! Hey... Oriol! I don't know what the fuck's happening, man. Let me go! Oriol! 135 decibels and the son of a bitch isn't breaking. It was you! You killed Axel, Oriol! Even his father knows it! He did it because Axel Collins was fucking his mum! Yesterday I didn't tell you the whole truth. The reason why I drove away is because there were seven kilos of cocaine in the car. They were hidden in an inflatable banana. You know, the ones that you find on the beach, for kids. I found it and I took it. And now there are two Romanian traffickers who are trying to kidnap my friend's girls. And it's my fault. It's all my fault.
