 Axel lived his dream. That's how he became the greatest DJ of his time. This is your great idea? Start a club here? Yeah. You spent all our money on this? Uh-huh. It was pretty cheap, though, 'cause no one else is gonna start a business here, are they? Unless... that business makes more noise...

 ...than a fuckin' jet engine! Yes! That's fucking genius! Come on! Inhale the fucking kerosene! Whoo! Whoo! Who's that? Hey... He broke down every boundary. He always followed his instincts. It's how he got what he wanted. Okay. Meanwhile, I was sat at my desk, looking out my window at the rain. Oh, my God! Yeah!

 Whoo! ♪ Music's gonna set you free ♪ Every Friday night... I'd come back from the supermarket with my shopping and I just thought that was my life. The idea of that changing was... about as likely as the world turning in a different direction. Whoo! The speakers are waterproof. Let's listen to the tune underwater. - Whoo! - On your own, baby! ♪ You just wanna fly with me You just wanna fly with me ♪ ♪ You just wanna fly with me You just wanna fly with me ♪ ♪ You just wanna fly with me You just wanna fly with me ♪ ♪ Fly with me, you just wanna ♪ ♪ You just wanna You just wanna fly with me ♪ - Oh! - ♪ You just wanna, you just wanna ♪ ♪ You just wanna fly with me ♪ ♪ You just wanna, you just wanna ♪ ♪ Fly with me ♪ And now I'm on Ibiza... and it feels like anything's possible. Hey. We can be whoever we wanna be. All three of us. And how we gonna do that, Zoe? We can do whatever we want. There's no limits. You're right. I know exactly what you're talking about, Zoe. Have you any idea what it feels like to spend a lifetime hooked on the same woman and then... bang! You have a flash of inspiration. You realize you're never gonna get back with her. And... you don't even care. It's like a... a... um... click, you know, going off inside your brain. For the first time in my life, I feel like I'm on the open road. I can be reborn. I... I can fall in love. I... I can be a better dad. Oh, for fuck's sake, so much better. All my life, I've been labeled a hippie, someone that can't commit to anything. And you know what happens when someone tells you something over and over and over again? You believe it. And you stop believing you can be anything else. Like being a mum. Why can't I be a mum? I love kids. I'll impregnate you right here and now... ...if you like. Marcus. I would. Having children is the most wonderful thing in the world. But being a parent's really hard. - It's hard. - Yeah. You have to get them to tell you everything and they have to believe everything you say. You have to be on your A-game 24/7. No one can live up to that. No. So then, one day, the bubble bursts. Oh, fuck. I've gotta call me daughter. - No. Zoe, wait. - No. - No, no, no, don't do that. - Zoe... - I have to! - It's not a good idea. - It's not a good idea. - Fuckin' hell! All right. Okay. - Zoe, don't think you need to now. - Not now. Last time I spoke to Jenny, she asked if I'd got sick of being her mother. I need to talk to her, I need to explain. It's just... It's not a good time, baby. - No, no... Oh, fuckin' hell. - Zoe. It's not a good idea, sweetie. Jen? Jen, listen to me. I just wanna tell you, you are the most important person in my life. I knew it from the moment you were born. I was fuckin' terrified. But I love you. Look at you. I remember when I used to drop you off at the school gate and then I could pick you up and I could hear about your day. Do you remember that day you told me about milking the goat at that farm? It was like you were telling me some great odyssey. Listen, Jen. I... I know I'm not perfect, right? And I know we can't always be joined at the hip. And that breaks my heart. But I'm... I'm here and I'm feeling things, and I just wanna share them with you, Jen. I wanna share things with you, and... and I wanna talk about feelings, and I wanna talk about mistakes, and the drugs. Jen. Jen! I took ecstasy tonight. To see if it gave me some insight. - What on earth are you doing, Zoe? - Dad! 'Cause it... it looks to me like you're calling your daughter high on drugs at four in the bloody morning. I barely recognize you. I don't know what you've become. or... or what you're doing with that thug who threatened me. Bo... Boxer threatened you? Yeah, he... he said you wanted to live la vida loca. Like you... you wanted to try things. Uh... Like I was the one to blame. You're the one who used your brother's death as an excuse to go to an island and fuck some guy and wreck our entire life. I'm gonna ask for custody of Jenny and I reckon they'll give it to me. Do you know why? Because you have got the full package, Zoe. Infidelity... and abandoning the marital home. You wanna be honest with your daughter? Tell her that, uh... you've got a trial tomorrow. Tell her that you might get four years in prison. Tell her the next time she sees her mother might be through a glass screen, - surrounded by criminals. - Jenny... I loved you. I still do. Welcome... to your rebirthing ceremony. What is that? Mescaline, harmaline, and, uh... a little bit of something else. Just to... help... with our insight. Fuse our minds. Oh. You're going to take it too? You're not the only one in need of rebirth, Oriol. We both have wounded souls. How can I expect to be anybody's spiritual guide unless I exorcise me own demons? This... will allow you to see yourself for who you really are. Oh! To see... your toxic personalities and rid yourself of them. Ugh. Come. Come. Now, remember... there is no danger. And don't be alarmed... by anything you see. You ready? - Oof! - You ready? - Ooh. - Ooh, there it is. Oh, there you go. - There's no danger. - All right. Don't be alarmed by anything that you see. They're here. Good morning, madam. Oriol is still not answering my calls. He's told you a thousand times that he wants to be left alone. Let him breathe! Good morning. You wanna be honest wi... with your daughter? Tell her you've got a trial tomorrow. Yeah, tell her you might get four years in prison. Te... tell her the next time she sees her mother might be through a glass screen, surrounded by criminals. I'm gonna ask for custody of Jenny and I reckon they'll give it to me. What the fuck are you doing here? I'm here to testify. - I'm a witness, remember? - I just need one minute. Hey, I'm here to help. Relax, okay? Don't you tell me to relax. My husband hates me. He said I've only come over here to take drugs, have sex - and get away from him and Jenny. - I'm... I'm... Don't you fucking touch me. Apparently you threatened him. Is that true? I don't remember that. I did call him a shit eater, though. Why? I wish I'd never met you. I roar... Shut up. I'm dancing, let me dance. Big and small! No, no, no. That's not how it was. It isn't like that at all. Shut up for a minute, I'm saying something very important. What's wrong with being a loser? Eh? It's okay to be afraid and stay hidden in the crowd. We have the right to live in the nest with Mum and Dad. If sex with Mum is nice, then let's enjoy it, end of story. Shh. Huh? All rise. Zoe Walker. The court clerk will read the indictment filed by the prosecutor. On June 8th, you were driving a Golf Cabriolet Mark 1, with registration PM-0031-AI. You were stopped by the police... ...by the police, and you decided to escape. You are accused of reckless driving and disobeying the authorities. Call the witnesses. Mr. Duarte Silva, if you please. The vehicle that Mrs. Walker was driving is owned by you. Is that correct, Mr. Duarte Silva? It is. Mrs. Walker asked me for my car to run an errand. Afterwards, she offered to be my driver for the rest of the day, and I agreed. Was there a particular reason for this? Yes. I was recovering from a thigh injury... that she gave me. I didn't report it because I don't think she did it out of aggression, more out of... nervousness. Could you be more specific, Mr. Silva? I mean, the defendant is somewhat... I mean, the defendant is somewhat... unbalanced. She takes impulsive decisions. I wasn't at all surprised when she accelerated from the police. What about the drugs Zoe Walker says she threw out of the window? I don't know anything about that. I didn't see her do it. All I can say is that, at some point, I had romantic intentions towards her. ...towards her. Until I realized... that she has a habit of randomly changing her mind. Do you know what I mean? White. No, black. No, white... No, maybe black. That might be why she invented the thing about the drugs. I couldn't say. That's all. You can go. Thank you. - Thank you. - Zoe Walker. Zoe Walker. Zoe Walker... I should have shot you in the balls when I had the opportunity. ...if you allow me, I'd like to give you these medical reports about the defendant, which make clear that at the age of 17, she was clinically depressed as a result of her brother's disappearance... ...which culminated in her admission to a psychiatric clinic, and finally a suicide attempt. You must understand that the appearance of her brother's body could quite possibly have triggered the underlying psychological condition and even magnified her vulnerability and instability. Mrs. Walker has worked in a library at Manchester University for the last nine years, Your Honor. She has a family in Manchester. At no other time has she behaved in this fashion in the past 20 years. We were doing rebirthing therapy... when he just... vanished. It's a complicated process. You ingest substances to give you insight. And they take you out of your conscious plane. Only then can you confront the toxic parts of your personality, only then can you see who you really are and what you're doing to sabotage your life. Interesting. Uh, just tell me one thing. Did your fucking insight show you what the hell Oriol was doing when he "vanished"? Who the hell took him? I sensed someone approaching him. Who? I couldn't say, but it... It felt like... a bear. Or an ape. It was black and hairy. That make sense? You see things with the treatments, so... I... don't know. Hey, think. Who the fuck was it? Oriol says the Martínez are preparing for a war. The Calafats are trying to take their business back by dropping their prices. I don't know, maybe that was the bear. Pepe Martínez is the bear. Oh, fuck. Why are you all the way out here? Took me ages to find you. I want to be on me own. No noise, no tourists. How did the trial go? Yeah, all right. Do you want the good news, or the less good news? The good news is that all I owe is 3,050 euros. The less good news is, obviously I don't have it. I can't exactly get it out of the joint account, can I? Don't seem right. No, of course you can't. Especially not after your little call last night. I loved you. I'll get you the money. Fuck's sake. Hey. Zoe, wait. No, don't... Zoe... - Fuck. - Dad? - Dad, what the fuck? - No, listen to me. - What the fuck? - Zoe. Hey! Come here. Come here. Zoe! What the fuck have you done? - What have you done? - Nothing. Nothing. - Did you kill him? - I haven't killed anyone, Zoe. Why the fuck is he in there covered in blood? That Oriol killed your brother. I haven't touched him. I saw the photos from that party, right? There's this car that disappears for a couple of hours. That car... - belonged to Oriol Calafat. - It's a car. It's a car from 20 years ago. How can you... Look. I found this inside it. It's your brother's tooth. Someone used that car to shift your brother's body from the party to the port so they could move him to the mainland. And back then, Oriol Calafat had his own speedboat. Right, so what are we gonna do? - Shoot him? - I'm gonna bring him to justice, Zoe. I'm taking him back to England. By law, they have to investigate. But the coroner can't summon a foreigner, so I'm taking him over there and I'm gonna force him to testify. And I'm gonna have him tried and condemned for your brother's murder. But, Dad, that's kidnapping. Well, no one in Spain's gonna do anything, Zoe. What did you really come to Ibiza for? Was it to find a murderer... or was it just so you could leave your family? Voilà! Olé! Look at that, eh? Hey! - Whoo! - How about it? You put chorizo in the paella? Paella in Spain does not have chorizo. Well, that's how we do it at home. Innit, little one? Eh? - I like chorizo. - It's a Mancunian paella. - These English people... - Pass your plate. I'm gonna help you with this. If not, it's gonna be a disaster. Just... - Okay, just... - Mm. It smells nice. - You gotta try it first. - Take this to my dad. - There you go. - I'm not having chorizo in paella, because in Spain, we don't do that. - Just try it once. - We don't do chorizo in paella. - You gotta try everything once. - No! What? I'll give you all the chorizo. - Pretty good job. - Right! - Good. Pretty good job. - So! To Mancunian "pai-ella." - Paella. "Pa-e-ya". - "Pay... Pae-eya". - Pae... - Muy bien. Muy bien! Cheers to you, sweetie. This looks nice. Anna, please. Have some paella with us, come. No, Kika, please, don't get up. I don't wanna bother you. I just need to get Tanny and Matilda, we need to go to the house. The hairdresser's coming to get us ready for the wedding. Come on. Matilda, sit down. I'm not going to the wedding, Mum. Yes, you are. No, I'm not going to the wedding. And why not? You're free to marry that guy. I'm free not to come. That guy is called George. I've not spoken to George for more than six minutes since I met him. Maybe he's addicted to shagging you. - I don't know. - Mm... But he doesn't like me. He doesn't like Matilda. He doesn't like kids. Especially if they're overweight. - Tanny, now's not the time. - Why not? That guy isn't my dad, and he's never going to be. When am I supposed to talk about it? Huh? I know that you feel bad about your dad - and everything that's going on with him. - Fuck. But you need to understand, it's been a tough time. Okay? He's made certain choices and they haven't worked out well for him. That's not true. He never had any choices. It was you who wanted the big house. You think I don't know? I was only 14, and I could tell. He told you he couldn't afford it. But... you wanted it. And so he bought it for you. And that's how it's always... always been. Deep down, I'm actually glad you're getting married. Because Dad deserves a fresh start. Tanny... that's enough. Just leave it for a bit, all right? Just... Look... Andreu, I'm sorry. She's a teenager. It's her hormones, you know? Divorced parents, a new life... You put all that together, and... boom! That's all it is. I think she needs you to come to the wedding with her. Yeah. That's what she needs. I know it's difficult, but, look, it... it's a small ceremony. I think it is really important... I think it's important that she can see that everything between us is not broken. Yeah? Okay, I'll be there. Yeah? You sure? Yeah, 'course. Look, Anna... I am sorry I was such a twat at David's the other night, right? And for everything that I said. It's just really difficult to accept that you got over our relationship a year and a half before I did. Honestly, you... It's not necessary. You don't need to... No, fuck off. It is necessary. I've been a dickhead, Anna. I was hooked on you. I mean, totally fucking dependent. I don't feel like that anymore. Look. You deserve to be happy, right? - We both do. - Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. These two got married in front of a fucking judge this morning. Oh, yeah! Whoo-whoo-whoo! I tell you one thing. In all my days, I've never seen a love like this. If these two break up, it will be the end of love. All right, get her down, boys. Good lads. Right, listen up. Marcus Ward and Anna Connor. With the power vested in me, by me, the Lord God Amadeus, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Go forth, be merry, and fuck until kingdom comes! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! ♪ When the angels from above ♪ ♪ Fall down And spread their wings like doves ♪ - ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ - ♪ As we walk hand in hand ♪ ♪ Sisters, brothers We'll make it to the promised land ♪ How you can have the cheek to call me after what you did. Who's the unbalanced one now, eh? Black, white, black, white. Where are you? I'm at the police station, thanks to you, and paying 3,000 euros so I never have to see you again in my life. I'm not here for an argument, okay? I came to warn you. Warn me about what? Your father has made a lot of progress in his investigation into your brother's death. Come here. I went to talk to Cristóbal. He told me your father came to see his car... ...which is actually Oriol's car, and he found your brother's tooth in it. And there's another funny thing. He's still using his old police toys. You have two options. Either you tell me where your father has taken Oriol and I'll sort this out without violence. Or... I'll tell the police. And he will get six years in prison for illegal detention. Free Oriol. And then your father can go home for a rest. I'm going back to Manchester, mate. And I need you to keep an eye on Zoe for me, please. Yeah. Clint... I'm not going to ask you what's going on because... if you tell me, I'm going to have to arrest you. Yeah. Ah, Spain's not so bad, eh? No. When I was back in Manchester, I thought I wouldn't be able to stand it. You all talk so fast and so loud and your bars all smell like deep fat fryers and you have your bloody dinner at ten o'clock at night. Yeah, it's all right. Maybe if we'd found Axel's killer 20 years ago, I could have found a new life here. Hey, maybe I could have, uh... signed up for a salsa class and got a new girlfriend, eh? Oh, well... I'm glad I signed up before you. But you know what they say. It's never too late, my friend. Yeah. That's what they say, eh? Yes, that's what they say. Adiós, amigo. Goodbye, my friend. Zoe, love. I thought it best you don't come, after all. I reckon I need to do this on me own, so... I'm gettin' the first ferry out of here. Don't worry about me. I'll call you when I'm home. Bye, love. He's going to the port. He's going on his own. Stop. Just stop. - Stop. - What's the matter? Eh? What's the matter? I just saw Marcus. It's kind of freaked me out a bit. It's quite normal. You're starting a new life. You've got to leave him behind. Are you in love with me? Of course I'm not. I'm not a teenager. Then why are you marrying me? Because we are great together. We are a team. We have great sex, we have great sex with other people. I'm laid-back, you're laid-back, we love talking. We don't have awkward silences when we are in restaurants... There are a thousand people out there, man. Next time, we should ask for a pink dressing room. And a bathtub - that's filled with fucking champagne. - Mmm! Oh, and jamón, a lot of serrano jamón. People pay us to fuck about. We're their heroes. They give us everythin'. Their drugs, their booze, their girlfriends. Probably let us fuck 'em just for a souvenir, eh? We are livin' on cloud nine. Better make the most of it. Oi! Why don't we take a ride in that limo? I like it. - Let's have a fucking party in a limo. - Yeah. Let's go down the beach. I'll get changed. Thank you, Mrs. Ward. Can you help me? There you go. Can you believe how far we've come? We've got five clubs. In Ibiza. All of 'em sold out. If you told me that back in Manchester, I'd have bitten your hand off. And to top it all, the messiah of electronic music married you tonight. Gave you his blessing. Do you feel special? How could I not? People love you. They'd do anything to be as close to you as I am... right now. What would they do to be this close? Anna, what's this about? Marcus was in love with me. Head over heels. All the way through. - Brought you a coffee. - Thank you. At another time in my life, I would have been horrified to see you with a man like that. Like what? Well, like that. Look at him. It's like he has "loser" written on his forehead, darling. I hope it's Colombian and not from Manchester like your bloody paella. Are you going to start fooling around with Marcus now, Mum? No, my dear, of course not. Before, I would have told you you're nearly 40, you're pathologically immature, and he is a stoner in flip-flops. And that when you're desperate, Kika, anything seems like love. Well, Mum, I'm glad you wouldn't say that now. I don't think that, my love. If you want to fall in love with the deadbeat friend of your first boyfriend, go ahead. I'll support you. If this family can change... we all can, my love. Coffee and cocaine. Colombia, eh? Mm-hmm! Do you fancy a cheeky spliff? Go on, then. Mum, he's not just Axel's friend. He was my friend too. He comforted me whenever Axel left me. He came to beg me to change my mind whenever I left Axel. And, yes... it would have been impossible for me to fall in love with him back then, or him with me, because he was with Anna. But now it's happened. You know, when I could still walk, I was always doing something. Going to the office, to see the lawyer, playing paddle tennis, viewing properties I could turn into hotels. It took me being paralyzed to realize that I'd got it all wrong. I don't know, life has changed... quite suddenly, and things have come together... in a wonderful way... with someone unexpected. I can't make love with my wife, Marcus. I can't go and find almonds with my daughter. I can't go dancing with Conchita. The same thing has happened to me with your father after 40 years of marriage. It's taken him being in a wheelchair for me to realize. I don't even have the strength to get my revenge on the bastard who did this to me. I've always been sensible. I've done the right thing. I could have taken care of Pepe Martínez right at the start, when he was just a baby. But I let him grow. When he sent a truck crashing into my car, it's safe to say he wasn't simply trying to paralyze me. I'm not a good person. But I've always known when to stop.

What the fuck is up with you? You married us tonight, mate. In front of our fans. That means so much more than some fuckin' judge in San Antonio. Whoo-whoo! Do you ever get sick of being a twat, Marcus? Those fans don't come to see you, they come to see me. What the fuck are you on about, Axel? I'm talking about you living off the back of my talent for two fucking years. We. All four of us mix the tracks. We opened five clubs, together. What have you done? What have you actually done? Waved your hands in the air whilst I'm making people levitate off the fucking ground? Playing my tracks before I go out on stage? I come up with them all. I make the mixes. I'm Amadeus. You fuckin' passenger, Marcus! You fuckin' leech! You spend your life stuck on me. You fuckin' passenger, Marcus. - ♪ Everywhere a Judas ♪ - Pickin' up the crumbs. You're a loser. ♪ As far as you can see ♪ You're a fucking loser. Fuck off! Fuck off! Wahey! Shut... shut up! Hi, it's Clint. Leave a message. He's still not pickin' up. He's so bloody stubborn. Well, keep trying. Hey, um... what does the van look like? It's a Fiat Ducato Swift Kon-Tiki, English number plate, last two letters CY. - CY? Okay. - Come on, Dad, pick up your phone. Hi, it's Clint. Leave a message. Dad, listen to me. Pick up your phone. Pick up your phone! - Any news? - No. He sent me to voicemail. Oh, fucking hell. Fuck. Dad, listen to me. Pick up your phone. Sorry. Pick up your phone. They're gonna arrest you, Dad. Pick up your phone. Aah! There's another port at San Antonio. Your father isn't here. Well, you go, and I'll wait here - just in case. - Okay. Fuck off me! Zoe... I'm not picking up, love, because, uh... well, you know me, I'm not one for goodbyes. Well, the truth of it is... ...I didn't want you comin' after me... ...trying to stop me. If we get caught, it's six years in prison. And there's so much you could achieve in six years. I've got a funny feelin' that you're gonna be happy, love. I think your moment has come. A few days back, a friend of mine told me that Axel was a complete arsehole, who overstepped every line of what was acceptable. And my friend was right, you know. I've thought exactly the same thing for the past 20-odd years. But you can't stop loving a child because of that. I've come to realize that as I've seen your life fallin' apart. And I won't stop loving you, Zoe. If you don't come back to Manchester, if... you leave your family for good, I'll support you. Maybe if I'd done that with your brother... instead of chucking him out the house, maybe... ...he'd still be here today. I love you, Zoe. Whatever happens... I love you. Where are you? I've just killed a man. Fuck.
