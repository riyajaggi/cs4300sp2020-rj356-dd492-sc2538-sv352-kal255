 You can't spend a life going a hundred miles an hour. I'm a meteor, smashing through every barrier, hurtling through the void. But a meteor's gotta crash at some point. And it's only when you hit rock bottom that you realize you've got a choice. You either die or you be born again. Whoo! Follow me! All right! Whoo! Here we fucking go, man!

 Come on! - Come on! - Come on! ♪ I'm falling in love ♪ ♪ I'm falling in love ♪ On the day of my mother's funeral, I went out to get smashed. And I ended up in the dirtiest joint in all of Manchester who were playin' shit music. So I told the bartender, I told him, "You change that track, or I'll come round there and do it myself." That barman was Marcus! Come on! Yeah, I fuckin' did! And I asked him, "Why aren't you playin' your own music?"

 And he said, "Nobody wants to hear it." Didn't you? Mm-hmm. And I told you... I told you we'd make everyone on God's green Earth hear it. We fuckin' did! Come on! Right. And then his mates turn up. Anna... Mwah! Mwah! ...and David. Yeah! Who'd have thought it, eh, Anna? When you walked in carrying your art history notes, that you would find yourself counting more than 20 million peseta after every single gig. Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! I love you! Back in Manchester, we thought we were the good guys and the cops were the bad guys. And when my dad chucked me out, I thought he was just shitting on my dreams. But nobody could stop us. And we got what we came here for. Fame, success... ...money! I can't get excited about that anymore. I tried to look back at who I was when I was makin' those early tracks, and I don't recognize myself. I don't. Do you know what kills me... is that I think my dad was right... is he was the good guy... not me. So I'm gonna start again. And I'm gonna burn everything that got us to where we are now. And I want you to do the same. I want you to burn it all, 'cause I wanna be free. Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! Free! - ♪ Hey, come on ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Come on ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ No soporto las corazas Que se imponen las personas ♪ ♪ No soporto las personas Que nos tratan como idiotas ♪ ♪ No soporto las serpientes Ni las ratas ♪ ♪ Ni los escaparates ♪ What’s this guy doing? I don't know. What's he doing? Hey! Do you have a phone? There's been an accident, and I've run out of battery. Dad? It's Lieutenant Gonzalez from the Civil Guard. Listen... your father's had an accident. Um... What... what kind of accident? The agents are getting the certificate ready. Um... they believe your father was driving too fast along the forest road and lost control of the vehicle. We need some information about him. I'm so sorry. What are you doing here? He didn't get to the port at Sant Antoni, so... I went to look for him where I last saw him and... But he... He already had the accident. I'm sorry. No... No, please. Zoe. - Please. - No, no. No? - You feel nothing? - No. No. I've read... there are people who, after spinal injuries, have a better sex life than they did before. - Oh, yes? - Yes. That's curious. Where did you read that? On the internet. I don't feel anything, but... I could still pleasure you. Yes? Or if you need to, you could see other men. From now on, that wouldn't be a problem. Hmm? Oriol! - What... - I'm okay. - What have they done to you? - Mum, I'm okay. - What do you mean, "Okay"? - They tried to kidnap me, Mum. When? What happened? - But... but... - Mum... I'm okay. It was the Martínez family. Have you called Boxer? Yes. And I did something else, too. I killed the guy who was trying to kidnap me. The son of a bitch who was trying to fuck with me, fuck with this family. I am no longer afraid. I don't regret what I did. We're done bowing our heads, begging for peace. From now on, we'll hit back against every blow we get, but ten times harder. Your father and I were investigating your brother's death... just as we did 20 years ago. The scientists' report is not finished, but... everything points to an accident. But I have reasons to believe that it wasn't. What do you mean? Come. Look, I know that my father kidnapped Oriol Calafat, kept him in his van. Yeah. This is a reprisal from the Calafat family. Are you sure? They cleaned the camper van very thoroughly before the police arrived. It had to be a professional. It was that bastard. Boxer. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Twenty years ago, he threw your father off the island. Oriol Calafat murdered your brother. Your son's gone to India. And when Boxer found out we were getting close, he threatened to kill you. That's why he left. Now, they have killed your father, but maybe we can also get them for your brother's death. Go back to Manchester. Get away from this island, from the Calafats. - Please. - Thank you. Zoe, it's Anna. I know that last time we spoke to each other, we both said some awful things that we didn't mean, but... - Anna... - I'm getting married in a few hours, and I would really like you to be there. It's just gonna be a small thing. Marcus, David, the girls. That's about it, really. Anna, I... I can't. Please, just... just let me talk. Zoe, we've known each other since we were kids. You know, you've seen me... sober. You've seen me drunk. You've seen me laugh and cry and dance and make a fool of myself. You've even seen me making love, for God's sake. There's not many people on this island that can say that. I'd just really like you to be there. Anna... I'd love to come, but... I'm in a police station. My dad was in an accident. He's dead. Do you know... when we first got together, I was like, "Fuck! She's as immature as I am. How's this gonna work?" "It's gonna be a car crash." So I said to meself... "I've got to get rid of a few things." - The spliffs. - I know. The flip-flops. Oh, my God. The all-nighters. Growing up is the worst, but for you... I'd do it. Hey. And a panama suit ain't a bad way to start, right? Wait. I thought you were doing it out of respect for Anna, not for me. Come here. I don't feel that way about Anna anymore. For the first time I can remember. It's taken 23 years of living together and two years of divorce, but that's okay. We've been through everything together. Oh, and I mean everything. It was a... wonderful fuckin' love story. You know, the secret are the three Fs. What's the three Fs? Friendship, fidelity, and fuckin' like rabbits. Oh, fuck. Kika, I'm sorry. Uh... Oh, man. Goin' on about me ex like that. - No, that's... - Look, no. I... I don't know what I was thinking. I don't mind that, Marcus. But you do know that Anna slept with Axel, don't you? What? How do you know? Listen. I know you're angry and we've broken up, but I really want you to come. I'm not going, Axel. I never want to see you again. I don't want you to call or wait for me after school. Hi, Axel. And you can get rid of that tattoo on your chest because I'm never getting back with you. Hey. Little one, you were right. I can't carry on like this. It doesn't matter, Axel. It really doesn't matter. No, no, no. It does matter. Everything's gonna change today. When I leave all this behind, I need you with me. Kika, you're the only thing from my old life that I want in my new one. I didn't go. And then I never saw him again. You know why I didn't go? No. I asked him what had happened to make him change all of a sudden. And he said, "I've hit rock bottom. I've slept with Anna." Why didn't you tell me before? In all these years. I don't know, Marcus. I... Sometimes you get involved in other people's relationships and it also screws it up for them. And yours was so unique. I couldn't do that to you. And I don't know if you had an arrangement with Anna. Or if maybe you knew. Come in. Perdón. Hay dos mujeres fuera que preguntan por Mr. Ward. Dicen que son DJs. There are two women asking for you downstairs. They say they're the DJs. I'm gonna take a shower and then go to the hairdresser, - and I'll see you later, okay? - See you later. Hi. Marcus? Do we know each other? You are friend of Grigor and Yuri, right? - Thank you. - Mm-hmm. Not really friends, you know. More like acquaintances. I'm wife of Grigor. She wife of Yuri. It's two weeks since we hear from them. You are their client. What do you know about their disappearance? Me? Nothin'. I thought they'd gone back to Romania. No, they haven't. And we are very, uh... worried 'cause the police are looking for them. Um, they found their boat 90 miles from the... Cum îi zice, fă, la ăla? - Shore. - Yeah, the... - From the shore. - ...shore. With their clothes, their fishing equipment, their drugs. Sh. Sh! Sh, yes. Yes, sh. Uh, not a good sign. We come to Ibiza to find out what happened. I... I don't know what to tell you, you know. I'm desperate for 'em to turn up meself, you know. They left me high and dry. If I knew where they were, I'd have gone to find 'em. Good luck. It's five o'clock. It's time to call the police. - Uh, give me your mobile. - Don't have data. Do you have roaming? - Uh, to make call. - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. - Uh, show me your phone. - Here. - Let's see. Hey! What the fuck are you doing? My ex-wife is getting married in a couple of hours. - I'm meant to be a witness... - Just a moment. Calm down. Raluca, hurry. Listen, um... Raluca? Just give me back my phone right now, or I'm gonna fuckin' lose it. And that wouldn't be good for any of us. They know me round here. Okay. No, make the call. Make the call. Why Grigor call you 16 times and you not answer? Hmm? Look. June 8th. Right before he disappeared. Are you lying to me? Hmm? You little piece of shit. No! For fuck's sake. Look, I... I didn't pick up 'cause I was at a friend's memorial. Just give me it back. She will, but first, come into the truck. What truck? Johannes is inside. Finnish guy. What the fuck is this? And brother, Dragos. And father, Florin. How... how are you doing, Mr. Florin? What's up, Marcus? We waited for you yesterday, Marcus, but you didn't come. That's strange because you have my drugs, but I don't have your money. So I asked Yuri, "How long do we give him?" - He says... - Two hours. Two hours. I say, "It's Marcus." - He says... - Okay, 24. Okay, 24. And now you're not picking up. That's just a message, for fuck's sake. Look, I... I was late making a payment, and... and they got a bit upset. It wasn't late, Marcus. You didn't pay it. I know. I do family accounts. You are number two suspect. You... are number one. One of you killed them, so I make one of you swallow balls. It was that asshole. For fuck's sake! I... I didn't kill nobody. What the fuck are you talking about? You took those drugs. He was in a boat nearby the area the day of the procession. I'm going out with the daughter of the richest guy on the fucking island. Why would I need to kill a couple of drug dealers for a few packets of coke? He killed Yuri and Grigor because he couldn't fucking pay. - Oh, fuck off! - Then he sank them in the sea and took all my fucking coke! Yeah! I bet they're still down there. Oh! Look at him, eh? Shouting, making accusations. Oh! Perhaps it's because you've got something to hide, Johannes. I'm gonna fuck you up, you fucking fuck-face! - Hey, hey! - Okay. No, all right. Look, look, look... Let's just go out there and we'll see. I can get us a boat, diving equipment. Let's go and take a look for 'em, then we'll see who's gonna eat their balls. Let's go. Can I drive? I need to do something mindless. Sure. Deje su mensaje después de la señal. Today, I had to lie to someone. I did it for you, Mr. Calafat. But... I don't think I can keep doing it. I'm not the person I used to be. You can move in, and I'll look after you. You'll not have to worry about anything. Nothing at all. Thank you for everything you've done for me, but... I am very tired. Put your belt on. And I'm getting too old to live above a club. Please accept my resignation, Andreu. Zoe, slow down! Zoe! Zoe! What have you done? Zoe! Have you killed him? No. Not yet. What? Help me. - Grab his arm. - Uh... - Why... - Come on! - All right. What now? - Open the boot. Anna, open the fucking boot! Open the boot! Open the fucking boot! Anna! Open the fucking boot! Come on! What are you waiting for? Open the boot! Lift. Zoe... Zoe, what are you doing? What are you doing? Zoe, what are you doing? This bastard knows everything about my dad and my brother's death. Twenty years ago, he said he was gonna kill me. If you don't want to help me, I'll do it on my own. Do you wanna tell me what the hell we're gonna do with him? Uh... Let's go to the bay where Oriol keeps his boat. I've got an idea. Yeah, okay. Okay. Okay. - Do you know somewhere quiet we can go? - Yeah. I can't! I can't fucking dive. I've screwed up me leg. Falling off a... ladder in me garage. Auzi, fă? Dacă-i şchiop, să nu se înece, dracu, pe acolo… Bine, hai, rămâne cu noi, na... Dragoş, te duci singur cu finlandezu’! Marcus, you stay with us. This is a step up from the harpoon, Zoe. Shut your mouth. You knew exactly who I was, right from the very start. You kicked my father off Ibiza 20 years ago. You knew Oriol Calafat killed my brother, and you tried to cover it up. That's why, for the exact same reason, you drove my father off the fucking road and you killed him. When I arrived there, he was already dead. I was the one who called the police. Fuck! Don't lie! Stop fucking lying to me! All that stuff about wanting something with me is bullshit! You're a fucking arsehole, and you have destroyed my life... to protect a killer! Zoe, that is enough. You wanted to control me. You wanted to know what I was finding out. Just in case you needed to kill me in my sleep. I wouldn't be surprised if you killed those Romanians just so that I would owe you. Have you brought me here just to let off steam with a water pistol, harpoon girl? I brought you here to tell me the truth. Huh? You want to know the truth? I've never cooked a lasagna at four in the morning in my life. I live alone. But then you were there, and it seemed like the most romantic thing ever. I did it because I liked you. I never dance, for fuck's sake! I never painted women's feet before. What I told you in that message, it was true. You are the closest I've ever been to love in my whole damn life. Shut up. Nothing we've been through has been a lie. And you can skin me alive with that hose, but that won't change a thing. Did Oriol Calafat kill my brother or not? No, he didn't. He burned his club down. Yeah. He made him rip his tooth out of his mouth. - He hated Axel. - Yeah. Oh, he hated him! But he didn't kill him! For fuck's sake! Oriol got everything he wanted from your brother. Axel sold him all his clubs, all his property, all the rights to his music, and... and for a really low price. I had to call a... a special family attorney just to get it signed. That was a week before your brother disappeared. Why would he do that? I really don't know. - How do you know that Oriol paid him? - I was the one who handed the money over. Oriol paid him in small denomination notes of 1,000 pesetas. The takings of his clubs over the summer. Just to fuck him over. And what happened to the money? Ask his friends. I was about to ask Marcus when you shot me in the leg. That wasn't just Axel's money. It belonged to all four of them. He burnt it. What did you take tonight, Axel? Huh? What you said in the bonfire. We weren't any better back in Manchester. We were rough. You really think you're better off now than you were in Manchester? Mm-hmm. Your brother lost his mind, and he made a bonfire, and he put every single penny that he made from selling our clubs on it. We're in a dark place, Anna. I've fucked my best mate's wife. That's why I burnt it all. What exactly was on that bonfire, Axel? All our money. I sold everything to Oriol. All the clubs, everything. And now we can start again. Anna, we didn't come here for the money. We came here for the music. We came here to be free. - Look at me. - Mm. Look at me! Do I look free to you? David, it's not a very good time at the moment. I hope you're looking for some last-minute guests 'cause all we got here are waiters. I've told you, it's just an intimate thing. All right. Maybe I won't even make it. What are you talking about? Where are you? Hi, David. It's Zoe. You all right, Zoe? Did you kill my brother at his party? Anna just told me that Axel burned all your money. A hundred million pesetas seems like a good reason to me. Are you serious? Did you do it, David? He was lying. No bodies of Grigor and Yuri down there. Where's Johannes? Unfortunate accident. He's fucking killed him! What the fuck do you care, huh? You say he was lying. You say he killed husbands. You are a good liar, Marcus. But you don't trick us with money. You owe us... 230,000 euros, plus... 20% interest. Două sute şapte-şase. 276,000 euros. No problem for you, right? Now you have big shot father-in-law. Right? We come to live on Ibiza. Good business. Nice place to live. - Fuck off. - Bye-bye. - Te-am pupat, puiule! - Hai pa, păpuşă! Te kiss you, Marcus! - Să fii cuminte, da? - Pa pa! Don't talk to strangers anymore. Oh! Enjoy the wedding! What the fuck is this? - A Korean horror movie? - Hey. - Why's he strung up? - David, calm down. No, I don't wanna calm down! You've totally lost it, Zoe. I didn't do anything to your brother. I couldn't have. Why not? Because I was with someone that night, fucking. Off me nut. I didn't wake up till five the next afternoon, so I wasn't really in the perfect state to commit the perfect fucking murder. And by that point, I didn't even know Axel had burnt all our money. I was just in it. There's 600 people having the time of their lives, except one. Oriol. ♪ Well, I need your love ♪ ♪ Well, I need your love ♪ ♪ Well, I need your love ♪ ♪ Don't make me wait too long ♪ What the fuck have you done? It's my mother, for fuck's sake! You've tattooed my mother on my balls! I did it next to your balls. Besides, you made me. It was your bloody challenge. If you want to know what I think, it's better than the tooth. Oh, you think so? What the fuck am I going to tell my mother when she sees it? Tell me! Eh? ♪ I can't let go ♪ It's like coming out of your mum's womb, man. Come on! I could see him, in amongst all the madness, just looking lost and... and vulnerable. I could tell, you know, he just... he just wanted to forget. And by that point, I fucking knew how to do that. We didn't know what we were doing, who we were. We were just two... lost souls, you know, coming together in that moment. Can I see? It's not that bad. Your mother is very pretty. You think so? And then when the gear wore off, then, you know, one thing led to another. I don't know if it was his first gay experience or not, but what I do know is it was wonderful. So, what about the blood in the car? - What about my brother's tooth? - Anybody could have taken the keys, but Oriol didn't kill anyone before five at the earliest. - Why haven't you said anything? - What? I got Andreu Calafat's son fucked on smack for the first time. I didn't wanna piss off the most important man on the island. You wanted proof that Oriol didn't kill your brother. Well, there it is. - Zoe, no! - Zoe! Zoe! - Don't! - Zoe! Okay. Did you kill my father? You left me at the port. You went and found him. Did you kill him? I didn't do it. That's the truth. Fucking liar! Did Oriol Calafat kill him? He didn't do it, either. Okay? I arrived there, I set him free, and I told him to go so he wouldn't get caught up in it. It was an accident. Okay. I'm gonna believe you. No, it's okay. In this fucking world, we're all fighting the expectations we had when we were younger. We imagined that we would build this tower of light and sensation and ecstasy, but life is the exact opposite of that. Life is watching, day by day, as that tower is torn down and cast into the void like pieces of a children's toy. Zoe. Wait. Wait! Sorry for ruining your wedding day. Do you know how I met George? I was having dinner with Marcus, and he got up from the table next to me, and he topped up my wine, and then he asked me out for dinner the next night. Imagine that. Right there, right in front of me husband. But instead of feeling offended, I felt turned on. And then today, the day when I'm supposed to be marrying George, all I can think about is Marcus. You'd think after 23 years that that love would be dead, that you'd want a new life with a different person. But then you realize... that you've made a mistake. It's the second biggest mistake of my life. That money belonged to all four of us, you fucking arsehole! Yeah. Now we get to start from scratch. We each get a new life. Who the hell do you think you are? Huh? You can do what you like with your own money, your own life, but not mine. Your life's just as toxic as mine. Look at you. Rubbing yourself up against me so I'd fuck you, when Marcus could turn up at any moment. Have you ever stopped to think why you do that? It started out... as a fascination. And then it turned into an attraction. Maybe I make you so horny, you just don't give a fuck. Or... you just wanna be with someone who's charismatic and talented and just makes life better! Only reason you're with Marcus is 'cause you can't be with me. Marcus is a hundred times better than you, you arsehole. Nobody wants to be with a loser. Unless you just wanna be adored, no questions asked. And he can't see you for what you are 'cause you convinced him of this eternal fucking love. But you're just a fucking scam. Tell him. Tell him what we've done. Tell him that you're incapable of loving him or anyone else, 'cause if you don't, I will. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna take one last line. The fucking dregs. Oh. Zoe, I... I didn't kill him because of the money. I didn't kill him... because of all the horrible things that he said to me. It was the idea of losing Marcus. It terrified me. This is the only note left! Do you want it? Huh. A... Anna! I... I ca... I ca... Anna, help me. Easy. Easy. Wh... Anna! Help me! - Help me! - What? Why? - What's up? - I... What the hell happened? Axel? Axel! Anna! Anna! Anna, open the fucking boot. Open the fucking boot! What's going on with the champagne? Have you found it? Good. Gracias. Marcus, where have you been? Where's Tanny? She's not comin'. - I need to speak to him. - Okay. I was thinking I might not come meself. I've had a really complicated day. What's happened? I found out that night you killed Axel, you was actually sleeping with him, so that means for 20 years, you've been deceiving me to cover up a... a... a crime that... Well, ooh, I don't even fucking know what it was. What was it, Anna? What was it? What the fuck happened, Anna? What the fuck have you done? I don't know! I don't know how it happened, Marcus. I was off my head. We both were. And then he started telling me some shit. How we've all become terrible people. So what? So what? He sold everything! You know what was on that bonfire? All our money. He sold the clubs, the rights to the music. He left us with nothing! So what? He was our friend! Eh? He was Axel! Oh, shit... Marcus... Marcus! Marcus! Listen to me. Today... has been the most revelatory day... since that night. All I could think about... - was having you by my side. - Oh, fuck. On that night, 20 years ago, and every day since. Axel was wrong. You're my family. I still love you. Oh... Fuck. Did summat else happen, Anna? Anna, if something happened, just tell me, for fuck's sake! Stop shouting at me. Nothing else happened, Marcus. Nothing. He did a line, and he sank into the pool, and it seemed like he couldn't get out. And I drowned him. I pushed him to the bottom, and he didn't do anything. And neither did I. You killed my best friend. And I did nothing. I have to live with that. But so do you. I did it for you, Marcus. When I found out he burned everything, all I could think about was us. Our future, our plans, all of it burned to ashes. That's why I did it. I am terrified of losing you. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! He'll report me! I'll go to prison! Marcus! He's still alive! - He's still alive! - Shut the fuck up for one second! I can use this. Fuck! For fuck's sake! Give... give me it. Give me that. Oh... I'm sorry. I'm sorry! I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I really am. Fuck! The truth is overrated. One day you find out that your brother has been murdered, and you decide that you have to know what happened. You feel sure that when you do find out, you'll get closure. But it doesn't work like that. When you find out the truth... it just leaves you cold. But what you do realize... is all that matters is the journey that you've been on. Everything that you've been through. You have to live your life full-on, until you've run out of breath, whatever the consequences. You don't realize, but your journey is only just beginning. Do you wanna deal with Pepe Martínez, once and for all? Right now, there's a power vacuum in Ibiza's drug business. There's an opportunity to take over the whole bloody thing. Mmm. But you've gotta act fast before the Romanians take control again. We can't let them get any bigger. But we are not drug dealers, Marcus. We just coordinate the dealing in our clubs. Nothing more. You need to start thinking big, Andreu. You need a leader. Someone who's gonna go to Afghanistan and Amsterdam and make contacts. What you really need... is someone who's gonna control the supply from the source. Bolivia or whatever. And who's that man? Boxer just resigned. Me. I'm your man. - ♪ Welcome to my world ♪ - ♪ Ooh ♪ - ♪ Won't you come on in? ♪ - ♪ Ooh ♪ - ♪ Miracles, I guess ♪ - ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Still happen now and then ♪ ♪ Step into my heart ♪ ♪ Leave your cares behind ♪ ♪ Welcome to my world ♪ ♪ Built with you in mind ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪ - ♪ Knock and the door will open ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ - ♪ Seek and you will find ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ - ♪ Ask and you'll be given ♪ - ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ - ♪ The key to this world of mine ♪ - ♪ Ooh, aah ♪ ♪ Welcome to my world ♪
