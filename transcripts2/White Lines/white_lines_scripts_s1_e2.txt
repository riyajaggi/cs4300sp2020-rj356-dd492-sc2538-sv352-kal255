 Were there more than 15 people at this gathering? Yes, Your Honor. Was the music sufficiently loud to make it impossible for two people to have conversation? I hope so. Hey, Zoe! Come here. Come up. All right. Come here. Here. To the best of your knowledge, were narcotic substances consumed? I wasn't aware of any.

 ♪ Oh, dance with me ♪ ♪ Oh, oh, dance with me ♪ Would you say you were the promoter of this gathering? Did you gain from it? I've got a question for you, Your Honor. Have you ever had a good time? I mean it. Like, a proper good time. I give you top shit! This is an illegal gathering. You must leave immediately, or we're coming in. Anna, get Zoe out of here now! Go!

Let's fuckin' have it! Oh! What? You gonna arrest your own son? Come on! We'll say it got out of hand and it won't happen again. Anna's dad's a lawyer, and he says it's best just to be sorry. No, we'll get off. None of us have got a record. We'll get community service at worst. And then what? Like, DJ in an old folks' home? What are you on about? I'm on about staying the fuck out of jail. Uh-huh. And then what? Let's see. Then we reach the next level in Pac-Man. Yeah, we're all playing, mate. That's what life is. Come on. Let's do one. We've gotta get to court. What do you think Amadeus is all about? Havin' a great night? Makin' a bit of cash? Marcus, you've gotta see the bigger picture. What's that supposed to mean? It means not conformin'. It means havin' parties, each one bigger than the last one. It means transportin' people with our music so they can forget about this shit goin' on in their lives. And float above it all. What's goin' on with you, mate? Just took a pill, boys. Uh-huh. Dear Axel... has it really been 22 years since we danced at your parties? We feel your loss like it were yesterday. But death... is part of life. Like the flower that withers. But Axel's light lives on... in all of us. But especially... in his best friends and in his sister, Zoe... who is with us to say goodbye. Did you know... that Marcus called me up and lied to me? Look... Zoe, I'm not defending what he did. But he knew how cut up you were. He... he was trying - to make life easy for you. - Think about how you would feel if you lost someone. All the questions that you'd have. Did they kill themselves? Were they murdered? That was the best you could come up with? Look, I know I screwed up, but we did really think he'd gone to India. It... it was the kind of thing we used to do. - Kind of like a... a spiritual journey. - Right. But in actual fact, he was killed, taken across the Mediterranean and buried in the desert like a dog. Doesn't sound very spiritual to me. I want you to think... about Axel. You've got an image of him in your mind, or... or something he said. Write it down. We're gonna bury them... so that they live forever. When did you last see him? At his party. There was, like, 600 of us there. What party? It was his 24th birthday. He wanted a 24-hour party. He wanted a party that were bigger than Freddie Mercury's, and he got it. With even more drugs. By the end, there was a sort of... collective amnesia. I know it sounds ridiculous, but nobody could remember what happened by the end of it. Are you telling me there were 600 people at this party - and no one remembers a thing? - No. I'm telling you... that none of us remember. Come here. What did the police say? Or did you tell them that he was meditating in India? How do you not remember anything? There was an investigation, - for Christ's sake! - Just say it! You think we had something to do with it? You think we're hiding something? Is that why you've been staying with me? You want to interrogate us? Search the house? What are you after? - I want you out of my house. - Marcus, calm down. Why should I? We went through this 20 years ago. I'm not doin' it again. It's time to go down. Everyone's here. Dear Axel... has it really been 22 years since we danced at your parties? We feel your loss like it were yesterday. I'm sorry for what was said earlier. This news about Axel, it's just so gutting. For all of us. Of course we're gonna feel anger and... and frustration. I went to India. After he disappeared, I felt so lost. - I... I went to Goa looking for him. - Seriously? I never found him, of course. But out of... of all of that pain and... and all of that frustration came something beautiful. I found meself. I think you could do with a bit of that. Fourteen years I was over there. The cow was a gift from me guru. They worship them. Whenever negative feelings arise, I... hug the cow... ...and it gives me peace. Hug the cow with me, Zoe. Feel the energy. I'm not hugging the cow. I was definitely at a point where I could do with some peaceful energy, - but it didn't last long. - Just take some deep breaths. Tell me what's happened. Okay. I mean, honestly, you should have seen these people. They were Axel's best friends, but they all seemed pretty suspicious to me. I mean, yesterday, Marcus was being accused of killing Axel and was half drowned so he'd confess, and now the guy's standing right there like nothing happened. I realized how I could get through to Marcus. Take the cocaine from his house and don't give it back until he comes clean. Hi. How's the leg? I'll live. Oh, if you're offering to be my nurse, to be honest, I'd rather have a professional. - I'm not. - Hmm. I do need to ask you a favor, though. Can I borrow your car? What's wrong with your scooter, harpoon girl? I can't use my scooter. Marcus and I have had a big row. He wants me to leave his house, and I need to go and get all my stuff. Give me your keys. Why? So I've got some wheels. Everyone's asking about my leg. I tell them I was shot with Cupid's arrow. Well... ...a harpoon, but it's the same thing, isn't it? A little mushroom tea? Not today, mate. You've reached Marcus. I can't pick up right now, but leave a message. We waited for you yesterday, Marcus, but you didn't come. That's strange, because you have my drugs, but I don't have your money. So I've asked Yuri, "How long do we give him?" - He says... - Two hours. "Two hours." I say, "It's Marcus." He says... Okay, 24. "Okay, 24." And now you're not picking up. You are in deep shit!

I already got here in this fucking scooter, didn't I? And let's get one thing straight, harpoon girl. No one drives me anywhere. I drive them. Hmm? Well, let's get another thing straight, buddy. I'm not letting you drive. I'm pretty sure it's not even legal, so unless you wanna get in trouble with the authorities, you'd better get in. Well, if it's about what's legal... Marcus. Hello, Marcus. Can we talk? Yeah. Hello? Hello? I'm sorry I lost it earlier about Axel, but I've gotta go. No, no, wait. It's... it's not about that. Matty called me. Is she being bullied again? Yeah, I know. I'm on it. Now it's all online. Those little shits call her "the croissant." Is she not following the diet? Yeah, most of the time. But with the hours I work, sometimes she asks for pizza when I'm not around. - Her big issue is ice cream. - No, Marcus. Come on. She's ten. You've gotta give her structure when I'm not there. What are you talkin' about? That's part of it. You're in London half the year. Oh, what? So it... it's my fault? No. Look, I'm not saying that. It's just... She's been all over the place since we separated, and sometimes she binges on ice cream. Why don't you stay with us when you're here? It's still your house, after all. Why don't you... try and relax? Here... have some tea. Don't we always find a way around our problems, eh? I don't really feel like it. Look, I've gotta go. Something didn't work out, - and I'm a bit worried about it. - Yeah, no problem. Oh. George has asked me to marry him. Planning summat small. Three or four weeks. Nothing grand. Just... I'm so fuckin'... - happy for you. - Aww! Oh! Anna! Here's to you both. Eh? - That's such great news. - Thank you. Thank you. - Right. - I'm so happy for you! Drink the tea! - David! - Such great fuckin' news. You have 16 new messages. First message. We waited for you yesterday, Marcus, but you didn't come. That's strange, because you have my drugs, but I don't have your money. So what do you know about my brother, then? Not much. How come you wrote two pages for him at the memorial? Jesus Christ! You've been spying on me. It was a poem, for fuck's sake. Charles Baudelaire. You can't write down half a poem. Hmm. You're more gorgeous than ever, my dear. Oh! Aah! - You're exactly the same. - Except now I'm lame. Oh! What happened? Fishing accident. Ooh. That's Zoe. Axel's sister. They... found his body in Almeria. On your family's land. It looks like he was murdered and then buried 20 years ago. Hi. Hello. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's just, um... I know it's been more than 20 years, but... Axel was my first love. I'm Kika. Hi. Uh... I... - I'll do it, sorry. - Eh? - It's got all my stuff in the boot. - Okay. - Aah! - Oh! Sorry! Sorry. ♪ It's a sin, my darling ♪ ♪ How I love you ♪ ♪ Because I know our love can never be ♪ ♪ It's a sin to keep this memory of you ♪ ♪ When silence proves ♪ - ♪ That you've forgotten me ♪ - Mm. ♪ The dream I built for us ♪ ♪ Has tumbled ♪ ♪ Each promise... ♪ Your brother would never stop talking about you. We'd sit in cafés and write you postcards. I would draw starfish, medusas, crabs. Oh, and that yellow bikini you got for your birthday? I tried it on myself. He said we were the same size. She has no fucking idea who I am, does she, Boxer? Okay. You clearly have no idea who I am, do you? I don't. I'm sorry. Axel never told you. I did love that yellow bikini, though. I didn't get to wear it very much in Manchester. Hey, how old were you? Sixteen. You're about the same age as me. Well, maybe that's why he didn't say anything. He probably didn't want you to think he was a cradle snatcher. Oh, uh, turn over here, please. No, no. Your father said go straight to the funeral. Boxer, don't be a pain in the arse. Turn here. Look who's here. And I thought you wouldn't come. My driver brought me. What do you want? To see you. Don't you get it? I'm with Cristóbal. But you don't love him. Otherwise, why are you here? What do you think you're doing? You're nobody. Got it? - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh? - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. - Uh-huh. All right. Time to head. Since you like guys with money... I'm gonna leave you a trail. Just so you know where to find me. What are you doing? Where are you going? Like Tom Thumb. How dare you? Just take them back. Fuck you! You can't afford me! Gilipollas! You okay? This was Axel's favorite place. He used to come here before playing a set. You should have seen us together. A posh girl from Ibiza and a lad from Manchester. He didn't know it at the time, but I could be so much worse than him. What did you think when he disappeared? It was a relief for my family. They didn't want anything to do with him. They told me the same thing they'd said to everyone else. That he'd left. A beer, please. How's it going, fellas? Marcus. How are you, Popeye? All right, brother? Don't look like that, for fuck's sake. I was at a memorial, okay? Look, right. Uh... I wanna pay, but I... I can't sell the stuff. You know, the Calafats are gettin' heavy. So are the police. Sell it somewhere else. Police control all the clubs. Look, Grigor, mate... I'm just a DJ with two kids. You know? I sell a bit when I'm playin' to make ends meet, but... I don't really fancy going to prison. Do you know what I mean? So what do you want? I return the drugs, and... I return the drugs, and we're all good. Okay. Do you have a receipt? Excuse me? Know why you don't have one? 'Cause we're not a supermarket. Let me explain. We are the wholesaler. You are the retailer. We give you the drugs. You sell it, and you give us the money. End of story. No returns. What if I can't sell it? I mean, fucking help me out, you know? I... I... I've been good up to now, haven't I? ...tomorrow morning... Oh, fuck. You can return the merchandise. Oh, fu... Thanks, guys. I owe you one. We take the drugs, and you give us 15 percent. Fifteen percent? Why? 'Cause we bring the drugs from Bolivia, and that, you fucking moron, costs money. That's about 35 grand! I think you'd better ask someone for a loan, Marcus. Who's it gonna be? Father? Brother? Wife? Call them. Yeah. Oh, hon, it's a lot of money. I've spent a small fortune on costume and props. Look, didn't you say we always find a way round our problems? Yeah? You see, the thing is, right now, I am fucking drowning! Why don't you ask George? Your fiancé? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Sorted. So are you here in Ibiza for a while, Zoe? Yeah, looks like it. I'm here just for a couple days. I can only take my mum and my brother in small doses. They're pretty toxic. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. We won't be long. You'd better wait here. Actually... Come here, my girl. I miss you, you know? Hello? Dad? The Spanish police looked into Axel's case. What are you talkin' about? There was an investigation. They must have told you. You're his fatherand a police officer. Is this really what you want? Do you want your life to fall apart again? Panic attacks, popping pills, someone lookin' at you while you sleep? No, of course not. Well, what's your plan, then? Is it looking for footprints? Interrogating people that aren't there, you know? Are you... Are you gonna go to the black market and buy yourself a gun? You work in a library, for God's sake. You lied. I know. You knew all along he wasn't in India. You knew about the police. You knew that they talked to his friends. I know you're thinking you're protecting me, Dad, but you're not. Okay, fine. I ha... I had a breakdown when I was 18. But that was then. This is now. I'm an adult, and I have to find out what happened to him. Do you understand? - Is that really what you want? - Yes. I have just been sent the preliminary autopsy report. Clint... What did it say? "Genetic tests confirm this is Axel Collins. The corpse has a high concentration of chlorine. Flocculant and anti-algae product were found in the lungs, probably due to intake of pool water through the respiratory tract. Drowning does not appear to be the cause of death. In addition to numerous historic scars, there are other injuries. Five ribs broken by some kind of lateral impact. In all likelihood, - this paralyzed the deceased." - Right. Stop it. Carry on. "Abrasions on knees, elbows and also toenails suggest he tried to crawl and escape before his death." "Finally, an open wound in the dorsal region, inflicted by a sharp object which severed the aorta. Death was most likely caused by massive loss of blood." Good afternoon, Zoe. I'm Andreu Calafat. On behalf of my whole family, I want to express my deepest condolences. I guarantee you can count on my family and our resources to help you in your search for Axel's killers. The land where his body was found belongs to me. It appears someone is trying to smear our name. I want you to know we are with you. Have you lost your mind? She asked for it. When she knew Axel wasn't coming back, she tried to top herself. What the hell do you think she's gonna do now? You're the one who believed in her all these years. And it wasn't me who let her go off on her own. I'm gonna go to Ibiza and get her back. One morning, I went into one of my restaurants, and... you stayed waiting outside, as always. But I had a panic attack, and I left in a daze through the back door. When I realized I had left you, I sent Boxer back to get you. But you wouldn't budge. When he grabbed your collar, you bit him like a beast. You wouldn't leave without me. No one has ever been so loyal to me. A part of me dies with you, my friend. Forgive the interruption. You can shove your help and your money up your arse. First, they tried to drown my brother in a pool. Then they broke his ribs. Then they crushed his neck until he was paralyzed. He tried to crawl away, and they just stabbed him in the back, and he bled to death like a pig. What are you saying? The body of your daughter's boyfriend turned up on your land, Mr. Calafat. It don't smell right. But then, what am I to know, eh? Maybe you're the kind of guy who gives his dog a funeral and buries the body of a man in a desert. Fuck! Hi, Joanna! Oh, I shouldn't be ringing you, should I? I'm not supposed to. It's against all the rules. Why did you call me, Zoe? Because I can't tell Mike I've got seven kilos of cocaine in the back of my car. Congrats on the engagement, George. Anna told me. Um... Go ahead. Shoot. I've got an issue. Take a seat. Aah... It's about me pool. It's broken, and, um... Well, you know, I've also racked up some debt. I need a loan. Thirty-five grand, to be precise. Thirty-five. Anna said, you know, you might be able to help. It's just for a few weeks, it's... How old are you, Marcus? Fifty? - I'm 44. - But your mental age is what? Eighteen? Nineteen at a push? - Yeah! - What on earth are you wearing? You look like Bart Simpson. What? At the first whiff of trouble, you go crying to your wife. Except she's not your wife anymore, is she? You come to her fiancé, cap in hand, looking for money. And for what? To pay for cancer treatment in Houston? No. To sort out your bloody swimming pool! Do you know what kind of man does that? A man with no self-respect. Perhaps there is a chance this little chat might be a wake-up call for you. Please! Fire it, light it! Ah, George, come down! Come down. Join in! - Oh, be... - Okay. No problem. Um... You know, George, you're a great guy. Just... forget it. Do you know what? Falling in love with Anna was the most incredible thing that's ever happened to me. She made me feel like I could crush the world between me finger and thumb. One day... when you're even older... and she's got tired of you and your fuckin' watercolors, you'll understand how I feel right now. ♪ Can you feel the pressure on us? ♪ ♪Can you feel the Can you feel the pressure on us? ♪ - ♪ Oh - ♪ Can you feel the ♪ ♪ Can you feel the pressure on us? ♪ - ♪ Oh - ♪ Can you feel the ♪ ♪ Can you feel the pressure on us? ♪ ♪ Can you feel the ♪ ♪ Can you feel the pressure on us? ♪ ♪ Can you feel the Can you feel the pressure on us? ♪ ♪ Southern trees ♪ It's on its way. - On its way? - He doesn't have it! Obviously, it's not here. I mean, who keeps 30,000 euros in their house? You know? They're not fucking narcos. All right? Look... We've had a chat, and... and they're gonna get it to me. Eh? What's he saying? Where are the drugs, Marcus? Where are the drugs? And forgive our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. I've asked Kika here because from tomorrow, we start making preparations for her to take over my position and all my roles in the family company. Is this a joke? No. It is something I have given a lot of thought. Well, Dad, you'd better unthink it! You call and tell me King is dead, that you need me to come over. For what? Were you trying to trick me? Our father thinks I'm the guy who killed your English boyfriend. Enough. He doesn't think that. Yes, he does, Mum. And if not me, he thinks it was you, right? That's it. Either your son is a killer, or you're married to one. But you're wrong, Dad. And I'll prove it. I will sit Axel's killer in front of you. Then you'll have to beg me for forgiveness, and Mum as well. What are you going to do? I'll do whatever it takes, Mum. Whatever it takes. How do you hot-wire a car? I'm sorry. Your language is somewhat new to me. Can you try asking me in a different way? Jeez Louise! That's quite a mess you got into. My God! Where are you going? I've no idea. Okay. You can stay at my place. Oh, but if my boss comes, you're hiding in the closet. Why are you helping me? You and Andreu want to find out the same thing. Who killed Axel. So I just thought, let's do it together. We can be like Bonnie and Clyde. Thelma and Louise. Just take me to a hotel. - I'll take you. - Yeah. Oi. To talk like that to Andreu... Whew. it takes balls. When I saw you in there like a wildcat, I thought to myself, "Fuck! You could have something serious with a woman like that." I'm married with a kid. I'm not looking for a holiday romance. No, I just meant in general. Like, you're the type of person I could eventually see myself with in the future. Nothing more than that. He wants Kika to take over. She lives in Miami without a penny to her name. With all due respect, as her mother, I can tell you she is none too smart. Andreu is having a bad time. You need to be patient. This is not a question of patience, Rafael. He's buried his dog in the family vault with his father, his grandparents. I can't get over seeing him kneeling there, praying... for a dog. It's a mental health issue. What do you want to do? Section him? Don't be so dramatic, please. He can stick around for a while. But we need to find a way... to cut Andreu out... and take control of the company before... he manages to destroy it. I'm not sure, Conchita. He's your husband. Have you never had doubts about God? What are you saying? Well, then imagine me with my husband, Rafael. ♪ If you're fond of sand dunes And salty air ♪ ♪ Quaint little villages here and there ♪ ♪ If you're fond of sand dunes And sa... ♪ Oh! What a doofus!
