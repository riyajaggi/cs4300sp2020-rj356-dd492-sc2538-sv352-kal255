 How irreparable? I just wanted to show Dad that he was wrong. That I didn't kill Axel Collins, and nor did you. Has something happened? Can you hear me?! What's wrong with you? Twenty years ago, Cristóbal Martínez went around bragging that he'd got rid of him. I just wanted him to confess, Mum. But I lost control. Did anyone see you? ♪ When I'm feelin' down ♪ ♪ When I'm feelin' down ♪ ♪ Your love is a pick-me-up ♪ ♪ And what comes around went that way ♪

 The police had to let us go. The only thing they can prove is the attack on Marcus. There's no sign of the Romanians or the coke, so as crazy as this all sounds, we're now the good guys, Marcus is a victim, and he's got police protection. - So I think things are looking up a bit. - I'm glad to hear that, Zoe, but there are still charges against you. - Disobeying the authorities. - I know. But I tell you what, telling the truth feels like such a weight off. I'm here to find out what happened to my brother. Nothing else. What are you doing? I'm just going through my brother's case. I'm trying to find a lead. The librarian investigator. There's a series in that. Don't make fun of me. Oh, no. I'm serious. Difficult case? Call the librarian! She'll find the culprit by looking through her sources. Checking the encyclopedia! Do you know what "royal turkey" is? - No. - It says here in the autopsy, "In samples of lung tissue, we found chlorine molecules, flocculant, washing-up liquid and a trace of bird feather, specifically albino royal turkey." Pavo real. It's a literal translation. It means "peacock." - Can I? - No, no... What's going on? You won't let me read it? Look... I'm trying to find out who killed him too. We're in the same team, remember? Like Starsky and Hutch. The librarian and the bouncer. No. I don't want you to read it. Why not? Because you're head of security for a family that, for all I know, might have had something to do with Axel's death. They found his body on their land. The oldest brother burned down his club. What would you do if you found out that Oriol Calafat killed Axel? Would you tell me, or would you cover it up? Because... I think you're the kind of guy who wouldn't grass on his boss's son. So, no. We can't be on the same team. Sorry. Okay. I get it. Yesterday... when you asked me for help with your problems, I said yes. Do you know why? Because I'm someone who says yes to everything. And you're someone who says no. - What's that supposed to mean? - It means I take a risk. I'm willing to trust you. I mean, I put you up in my house. I say yes to all. I... I jump into the unknown. And maybe I'm wrong most of the time, but do you know what? I survive. What do you do with your "No, no, no"? Can you ever enjoy yourself? Can you ever trust anyone? This isn't about a yes or a no. This is about doing the right thing. Now, where does that get you? Does it make you happy, or does it make you fucking ungrateful to people who help you? Okay. Get out. Take all your crap, and get the fuck out. Now! - Hey. Can I help you with anything? - Zoe! Could you open it? - Hey. - Hey! How are you? Good to see you. So tell me, what's the adventure for tonight? I've got nowhere to stay tonight. Oh! Well, maybe that means - you shouldn't sleep, then. - What are you doing? Put this away for her. Where's she gonna take it? Have some tequila, sweetheart. Cheers! Look, before you go, I just wanted to ask you some questions about Axel. Okay. What do you wanna know? How you met, and how your brother knew him, and what made them fall out. What the fuck have you done? - Wait, Dad. Listen to me. - Come here. Get out. Get out! - Wait, Dad! - Get out of my house! Axel was everything a posh family like mine didn't want. Rude, talented, so handsome. A rebel! My parents couldn't stand that he loved me. And when he got his first club, he named it after me. Isn't that romantic? Is that why Oriol burnt it down? Maybe. Maybe it was my mother. Or my father. Get out of here! Out! Andreu! Imbecile! You've broken a truce that's lasted 20 years! Leave him alone! We'll fix it. Fix it? How will we fix it? Why don't you ask your sister? I didn't kill Axel Collins, Dad! This is all your fault! - Why, you little... - Don't you dare touch that boy again! If you had believed me, if you hadn't thought I had killed Axel, I would never have gone after Cristóbal! You're to blame if the truce is broken, Dad. What blame? Blame is a bucket of shit that mediocre men throw around. Real men carry blame on their shoulders. Have some fucking balls for once and take responsibility! I'll fix it, Oriol... I'll fix it. That's my family. They infect everything they touch, like cancer. That's why I live so many thousands of miles away. You run away from your family? Why are you running away from yours? I'm not running away. I'm not brave enough to do something like that. I mean, I've come to Ibiza, - and I haven't even been to the beach. - What? Okay, here's the deal. I'm leaving tomorrow, but I'm gonna take you to the most beautiful beach before I leave. You'll love it. I promise! Come on! I do wanna keep asking you things, though, about Axel. You can ask me everything you want, tomorrow! - I'm not wearing the right clothes. - Come on, librarian! Stop thinking about everything so much. Your brother taught me that. Come on. Come on. You don't have to worry about every little thing. Let yourself go. Enjoy it! That's it! ♪ I'm gonna have you spinnin' round ♪ ♪ There go my senses Got my feet off the ground ♪ ♪ You've got me turnin', turnin' ♪ ♪ Spinnin' around ♪ ♪ You've got me turnin', turnin' ♪ Okay. What's going on? There's a problem, and Boxer hasn't come down. They don't know where he is. - What's wrong? - Problem with Boxer. He hasn't come down. I don't know. Weird! ♪ You've got me turnin', turnin' ♪ ♪ Spinnin' round ♪ You okay? We had a fight. Where does that get you? Does it make you happy, or does it make you fucking ungrateful to people who help you? Okay. Get out. Now. Look, if... if this is about the Romanians, then you don't have to worry. I sorted it. I told the police everything. The boats, the drugs, the threats. They said they'd protect us. You go through life feeling sorry for yourself. Begging for help. Saying, "Oh, oh, I'm so depressed. I take lithium." And I... I believe you, like a fucking moron. Okay. I'm really sorry if I gave you that impression. And now, you're all about doing the right thing. Huh? Take all your crap and get the fuck out. Now! Boxer... Okay. Look, I... I never meant to manipulate you. Or trick you into helping me. I also don't want you to think that I say no to everything. Down there, just now in the club, I said yes, and I had a dance, and it felt... It felt great. What did you do with your shirt? Did you go to a belly dance contest? - Oh! - It was the girls. But I said yes. Oh, Lord! Aren't you tired? We haven't slept in two days. Oh, no, no. Don't worry about me. I'll... - I'll sleep out here. - No, no, no, no, no. Mm... I'll take the couch. Thank you. I think I know why there were peacock feathers in Axel's lungs. Why? It means he was killed at his birthday party. At his party? It was wild. Huh. Yeah, his friends told me about it. There were parrots... ...white fucking peacocks... Whoo! Were you there? Everyone was there. Six hundred people. More. So whoever killed Axel was at his party, then? Yeah. But if you're thinking of playing Ten Little Indians, huh... you're going to have a problem, harpoon girl. It's not a plane crash. There wasn't a black box. Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! I'm so sorry, Pepe. My son's eardrums have been burst. I don't think your compassion can make up for deafening someone. I'm here to apologize. And to sort this out like the civilized people we are. All right. And what do you propose I do? Should I beat your son? - Break his legs? Paralyze him? - No. - You can't do that to Oriol. - Why not? Your son is not an athlete. He won't compete at the Olympic Games. My son is a DJ. A mediocre DJ, perhaps, but we're not talking about the quality of his music. We're talking about the quality of his dreams. Twenty years ago, one of your family drove my sister off the road. She fell into the sea and was without oxygen for 12 minutes. She was left with the brain of a two-year-old. I didn't retaliate. You've just retaliated. Ding, ding, ding, ding! The game begins. He did it for his father! He forced him, Pepe. That's funny. So who is more guilty? The guy who pulled the trigger, or the guy who told him to pull it? Look at you! How cute! So expat. ♪ I'm not from here ♪ - Whoo! - ♪ I'm not from there ♪ ♪ ¿A dónde vas? ♪ - ♪ Where am I going? ♪ - ♪ ¿De dónde eres? ♪ - ♪ Should I care? ♪ - ♪¿A dónde vas? ♪ - ♪ When will I get there? ♪ - ♪ ¿De dónde eres? ♪ - ♪ Can you even say? ♪ - ♪ ¿De dónde eres? ♪ - ♪ I'm on my way ♪ - ♪¿A dónde vas? ♪ ♪ I'm on my way ♪ Whoo! Whoo! See you tomorrow. Yeah. Sleep tight. Bedtime. Hey. David. - What's going on? - My, uh... My... my head is a mess. I need to, uh... I need to empty it. Then you have come to the right place. Good. Good. So, how did you meet my brother? It was at my house. He was... all wet, and wearing a swimsuit. And holding a Mozart record. This is my daughter, Kika. And he was flirting with my mum. Oh! Yeah. Typical cocky English guy. Cool, egocentric. Thinks he's better than everyone else because he's from the UK. That's not a great start for your first love, though. Those are the worst! The ones that kill you! Just... don't see it coming, and they just... take you by the guts. How did you meet your husband? The normal way. - You don't wanna talk about it? - No! Yes. Yes. Um... He worked at a hospital near my house. A... a psychiatric clinic. - I was 18 or 19. - That's cute. First love, no? Lasts through everything. But this lady's fucked other people, right? Sissy. She wants to know if you've, um... been with anyone else. Not for 16 years. Oh, my God! Don't listen to her, okay? There's no such thing as a normal couple on planet Sissy. But I admire you. Seriously? You admire her? You? Miss Can't-Make-Up-Her-Mind-2020? First, you're prowling after a guy, then you're getting it on with me. - And how about those Hungarian twins? - Hey! Two girls with her. - Sisters! Yeah. - Don't... don't listen to her, okay? - She's just provoking. - Wow! Don't listen to her. Don't listen to her. You lot on this island worship sex. There's more to life. - I know you think I'm a prude... - Oh! ...but I'm not. I took ecstasy when I was 15. I've been to illegal raves. Maybe more than most. But it was all just empty until I met Mike. Mike was the volunteer who looked after me when I was discharged. You were at the clinic? About three months after my brother disappeared, I, um... I threw meself out of a window. I am so sorry, Zoe. But Mike was amazing. Got me back on my feet. And it's not like we rushed into it. When he finally kissed me, we'd been to the cinema about three times and the park about 50. I'm serious! I choose to be with him every day. We share everything. So why isn't he here now? Hi, Dad. Where are you? Um, I'm just at the beach. I'm having a... a walk and a think. Uh, listen, I'm sorry about the other day. I... I was out of order. Which beach? Um... I... I think it's called Cala Conta. Right, wait there. I'll be 15 minutes. Your dad? - Does it really hurt, Dad? - Why would it hurt? It's... a... ro... bot... leg. Zzzz... I don't get it. How can you fall off a ladder and break the bone in two places? Well, at least it's the same bone, right? I mean, it could be worse. Tanny, why don't you take your sister, go get yourself a milkshake? A milkshake? I'm not eight years old. All right. A vodka orange, then. Come on. I need to speak to your dad. Zzzz... Bzzzzz... Zhooom... Bzzzzzz... That money wasn't for the pool, was it? No, it was for the pool. And a... couple of other things. So why have I got two police officers sitting outside my house and another one in the corridor out there? I owe money to some guys. In the last few months, I've... I've been dealing a little bit on the side. - You what? - I know. I know. Fuck, Anna, I... - I needed the cash. - Why would you do that? You've got two daughters! I just... I sort of slid into it. I didn't wanna lose the house! - Why haven't you sold it? - Well, for the girls. For you. In case you come back. Look. Zoe, she found out about it, and she went to the police. I told them the names of the guys. They're protecting us. It... It's under control. I swear. So what are you gonna do when you get home? Have you got someone who can look after you? I'll cope. - The brace makes it look worse than it is. - Well, what about the kids? No. Look, it doesn't make sense that we're apart. George is going to Ireland to work for a couple of weeks, so why don't I come and stay with you? Yeah? Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna go and find the girls. Tanny's quite capable of finding vodka orange in a hospital. Bufo alvarius. A Mexican toad. Contains a lysergic bufotenine. To give you some respite from all the noise in your head. It's not cheap. A thousand euros. It's a ridiculous price to pay - for a bit of peace. - I don't give a fuck what it costs. Okay. It's not regulated. I will need you to sign something so that I'm not liable. And I must warn you, you can lose your way... on any kind of trip. I don't want anyone to know I'm here. - Okay? - Of course. Who would I tell? Ow! What the fuck? Relax. It's the quickest way to get it into your veins. Use a fucking syringe. Come on! So now what? Ugh. - What the hell do you think you're doing? - I've come to take you back. What? Just grab your things and jump in the van. I don't know why Mike let you come out here on your own. I don't know why you think it's okay to come out here without any warning. Like you're picking me up from school. I'm an adult. I'll tell you for why. Because you don't belong here. You're playing at being a policeman, and you're forgetting your responsibilities where you do belong. - Where's that? - At home. What about your daughter? You just upped and left with no explanation. She's 14 year old. How did you feel at her age when your brother did the same to you, eh? Time to come home. I can't. They've got my passport. I'm waiting on a court hearing. I... I was caught driving away from the police. Mr. Collins? Hi. Hola. Um, I'm sorry for your loss. I... I'm Kika. I was your... son's girlfriend. Right. I'm sorry for your loss too. Are you gonna be here for a few days? Looks like it. I'll be over there, Zoe, when you're finished at the beach. Bloody hell! Kids! FORMAL REQUEST FOR LEGAL DISQUALIFICATION I started out picking almonds for the Calafats. Back then, if you were one of them, you were entitled to everything: houses, land... I can't hear you, Dad! I know, son. I know. Yesterday, I told someone you were mediocre. An embarrassment to me. But it's not true. I'm not going to let anyone go on believing they're better than we are. Hey, man. Why are you telling everyone Cristóbal killed me? That's what he said. He was the first to leave the party. Totally fucked. Never saw him again. Who was it, then? You really don't know? What's so funny? I can't remember anything. Just tell me who it was. Please tell me it wasn't me. Axel! Are you coming? Shall we go? I'm sorry, man. I've gotta go. I've got a date. Sleep well, my darling. Welcome back. What was our first date? You took me to the cinema to see 55 Days at Peking. Wow! How long ago was that? Forty years? All this time, I have loved you more than anything, Conchita. I'm just sorry I didn't make you feel the same. What is that? A summons, to test me for legal disqualification. To see whether I'm still fit to run the company, or if I've gone mad. You've left me no choice, Andreu. I don't know if all this is because of King's death, or some midlife crisis. No, you're right. I'm tired. And probably mad too. But I'm not going to see an expert. I'm retiring. I leave it all to you. You've won, my love. I'm off to the airport to say goodbye to Kika, and then... I'm going to sleep at my parents' old house. Good luck with the casino. Andreu, don't go. So that's his plan. Just to follow me around in his camper van. He's more like a bodyguard than a father. Axel said he used to control him all day, every day. Until one day he just kicked him out. What? I didn't know that. I'm going to Ibiza for a while, little sis. I've come to say goodbye. I had no idea. I thought he went to try his luck. Zo, Ibiza's where it's at. House music, dance, all the best DJs. It's the place to be. I thought he came to Ibiza for his music. Hey! - Oh! Zo, how you doin'? - Good. Hey, has a night in the cells changed me? Do I look different? Oh, hey, I came up with this banging beat. It's like... Come on, Zoe, love. It's late. Bedtime. I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. - Glad you're back. Sleep tight. - Night, Dad. - Yeah, good night, love. See you tomorrow. You've come back like you've been on holiday. Yeah? I should probably look a lot worse, considering it was my fucking dad who arrested me. You took your sister to that party. Screw your own life up if you want to, but you're not taking Zoe with you. Dad, it was a fuckin' party. People havin' fun. That's it. You should try it sometime. I want you out of this house. Or better still, get out of Manchester. You're kicking me out? - If I'm going, Zoe's coming with me. - Zoe's 15 years old. She's my daughter. She's not goin' anywhere. Do you wanna get yourself arrested again? And it won't be a night in the local nick this time. Is that what you want for your little sister? Talking to her brother every Sunday morning through a sheet of fucking glass? When I get back in the morning, you'd better not be here. I want you to leave. I'm making some dinner. Have you seen how much they charge - over that place? - No. Dad, you're not making any dinner. I don't need you here with your depressing views on life. I might not be the best mum in the world, but I am certainly not taking lessons from you. Axel was right. You can't see what's beautiful about life. Oh, and Axel knew all about life, did he? Dad, at least he smiled. Every time you were with him, he was smiling. That's because he was off his head on bloody ecstasy! Seriously? You haven't come here to slag him off. It's been 20 years. Do you know anything at all about Axel, except whatever rubbish he told you on the phone? Yeah. All right. It's easy to trash him when he's not here. And what's all this about you kicking him out? You let me think that he left because he wanted to. What else haven't you told me, Dad? Maybe if you hadn't kicked him out, he wouldn't have come here, and maybe he wouldn't have died. You can't blame me for that. Well, what did you do, Dad? What did you do when you found out that he went missing? Did you look for him? No, you didn't. You chucked him out, and you gave up on him. - Yeah? - Uh... Hello. Mrs. Walker? Uh, speaking. Hello. This is Lieutenant Gonzalez from the Guardia Civil. Um... We have located, uh... the traffickers' ship. It was abandoned, uh, about 90 miles from the coast. It looks like they have escaped. They were probably tipped off. Uh... Okay. Do you know what I reckon, Zoe? You're in a hole, and it's getting deeper and deeper. You ask for help, but you just keep on digging. Don't say that. Hola. Where you going? Hey! Where are you going? ♪ My heart beats in patterns To the broken sound ♪ All this talk about going back to normal. It sounds to me like you're trying to convince yourself. Convince myself of what?

The Romanians are coming. - What are you talking about? - The police called me. They found a boat in the middle of the sea with no one on it. So, what's the problem? There was a hundred kilos of cocaine on it! Which means someone's tipped off the traffickers. Which means they know about Marcus, means they know about me. Which means they'll come after us. - Nobody's coming after you. Calm down. - Don't tell me to calm down! - They're gonna kill us. - No one's going to kill you. Jesus! - They're drug dealers and murderers! - They're dead. Huh? Guys like that, they don't negotiate. What do you think I was going to do? Have a cup of tea with them? I... I didn't tell you to do that. I did not tell you to do that. Fuck! Does that make me a murderer? You're not a murderer, for fuck's sake! You weren't even there! - Just try not to think about it. Jesus! - How can you tell me to forget about it? You've just killed two guys! - Is that what saying yes means? - What are you talking about? I do say no. I say no to killing people. I say no to breaking the law. - I say no to being out of control... - Oh, God. ...and fucking everyone and anyone. - You're having a panic attack, okay? - You all think that I'm the odd one out on this island, but I'm sorry, my life is so much more simple than yours. Shit! - I feel really dizzy. - Ah, sit down. Oh, I think I'm gonna... I think I'm gonna pass out! Don't close your eyes... Look at me. Look at me. Breathe with me. My chest feels really tight. I think I might need a tranquilizer. Wait... wait... - Mm. Smoke this. - I don't want any of your fucking drugs! What do you think a tranquilizer is? Huh? Fucking pharmaceuticals. At least this is natural. Take a drag. Count to 15. Take another drag. Relax! Jesus! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. Come on. Lie down. Here. Just breathe. Yeah. Shh. Shh. Everything will be okay. Hmm? They'll never find the bodies. They'll close the case. Everyone will forget. Hmm? Shh... Yeah. Fucking hell.
