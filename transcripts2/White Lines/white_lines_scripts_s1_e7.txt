 Whoo! Oh, this was a great idea. Fucking hell. Oriol's got a fridge back here. Champagne! Happy surprise party, Oriol. - Wahey! - It's not a surprise party when someone gets your boat and nicks your champagne. Hey, whatever it is, he's gonna have the surprise of his life when he wakes up. Happy birthday! - ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - ♪ Zippin' up my boots ♪

 Boys! - ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - ♪ Goin' back to my roots ♪ - ♪ Happy birthday, ♪ - ♪ To the place of my birth ♪ ♪ Dear Oriol... ♪ ♪ Back down to Earth ♪ Holy fuck! Cristóbal! Cristóbal, get up and get out here! Putting Oriol's speed boat in Cristóbal's pool was pretty funny. Was that Axel's idea? Everything was Axel's idea. My God! Back then, we only cared about the present. We didn't think about the consequences or tomorrow.

 We only wanted to have a good time. Where have you been for the past few days? I haven't seen you. I've been with Boxer. - ♪ Danke schoen ♪ - I haven't left his place. - ♪ Darling, danke schoen ♪ - He's been painting a portrait of me. - Well, of my feet. - ♪ Thank you for ♪ It's the first time anyone's painted me, and he just spends hours looking at me. ♪ Picture shows ♪ We've been listening to music and watching videos of concerts on the Internet. There are so many songs that sound familiar to me, but I never knew who they were by. ♪ Second seat, go Dutch treat ♪ And he always comes up with something new to do. ♪ Danke schoen ♪ I mean... I've been peeling shellfish for 40 minutes at a time and making fish soup. ♪ Save those lies ♪ I love fucking your tight little pussy. - ♪ Darling, don't explain ♪ - Hmm! Carpe diem, huh? Three whole daysat his place. What does Mike think about your carpe diem with Boxer and not with him? Hmm? Boxer's just a moment in time. And then when I leave the island... I won't see him again, and that's okay. That's the point, isn't it? Carpe diem? Living in the moment. Hey. Hi. - I've got something for you. - What is it? Inside here is photos and videos and all my memories of Axel. And I want you to have 'em. Oh, David. Thank you. Why are you getting rid of it all? Well, for years, I thought I'd dealt with me past, but then when Zoe asked for the photos the other day, I realized I'd just been hiding it in boxes. You know? Everything that... that we went through and everything that I felt about him... Uh... You know, it's time now for those feelings to come out for everyone who was part of his life. - Mmm. - You okay? And how are you gonna do that? We're gonna have a dinner, tonight. Be the first time that all of us have been in the same place in 20 years. We'll talk about him. Just... We'll say the things that need to be said, and then we just leave it behind us forever. We should have done it long ago. Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Come on, put him down. Into the taxi. Oh, Marcus. I am so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm gonna take the girls to George's. I would ask you to come, but it's not appropriate. No, of course not. Don't worry. Besides, you know, there’s no need. Okay. There you go. Eh? George is allergic. Knew he wasn't perfect. For you. Oh. ♪ Good mornin', Vietnam, ha-ha ♪ ♪ My style is quadruple damage for MCs ♪ ♪ I make 'em huff and puff Like mufflers from Meineke ♪ ♪ Human exhaust, you wanna get lost? ♪ ♪ Rhymes plus Exxon Ride brains like Alain Prost ♪ Thank you. Hey, Marcus, what the fuck are you doing here? Having some paella. Only joking. I'm just a small-time dealer sticking up for his rights. For the past 12 years, our partnership has been... peaceful and harmonious. We’ve lasted longer than some legal businesses who do things by the book. We've had a simple agreement. I don't report you to the police and in return, you only sell quality merchandise. And it has worked. We've shared the profits and kept the drug business under control in our clubs. But now... the Martínez narcos are taking over. You're the one that asked us to stop selling. You wanted clean fucking clubs. - Healthy. - Yeah. Fuck's that even mean? It's the scourge of the 21st century, man. Healthy, vegan, crudités. Say no to meat because fucking cows contaminate the Earth. - Yeah. - No more rock and roll, man. No more Barbie Girl. No more fun. What are you talking about? It's Ibiza. Getting wasted never's gonna go out of fashion. I'm talking about five years' time, man. The avocado and the vegans will be the death of drug trafficking. You'll see. Is that your plan, Oriol? To open up a fucking cucumber water bar? Is that why we're here? Why do I feel like I am the only one who's actually worried about the business? Eh? Why aren't you surprised they're selling their shit in your patch? Were you expecting it? Or are you selling in the Martínez clubs now instead of respecting the pact that you've got with me? Is that it? Oh, you're fucking kidding me. What the fuck did you expect us to do, eh? Keep it all in a cookie jar? Yeah, sure, you lost control. But we lost more than that. We lost the coke, the clients, the suppliers... Yuri and Grigor have disappeared. They haven't disappeared, man. Something happened to them. Their boat was found 90 miles from the shore, abandoned, full of coke. Nobody just leaves a boat like that. It's weird. Yeah, it's fucking weird. Want to know what's even weirder? I went to the longlines today. There was nothing down there. Just a cement block and an anchor. - What the fuck does that mean? - I don't know what that means. But if I find out one of you took it, I'm not just gonna fucking break your legs. You'll be pulling yourself around in a little wooden trolley. Got it? I paid for those drugs, you asshole. I paid you not to sell them. So go find yourself one of those fucking trawlers and shove it up your fucking ass! Just shut up, please, and stop with the threats. All of you. We're all here to work this problem out. Okay? You're all gonna come back to our clubs. We're looking into new suppliers from Afghanistan or Amsterdam. We'll know soon. Your cut is going to be 55 percent from now until the end of the summer for all your troubles. We're going to start working together again and we will start trusting each other again. Right? Okay? Marcus! Marcus, wait up. - What the hell do you want? - Don't just walk off like that. What's up? You wanna talk about loyalty? I'm the only cunt round that table that's respected your brother's pact, and now I'm fucked. Homeless, livin' in me car with two fuckin' poodles. Marcus... Fucking joke. What's with Jack Sparrow's chest? Did you really go to David's house, or were you hunting for treasure? Yeah, David gave it to me. It's everything he had of... Axel. Don't you want to open it? The last thing I found out about Axel was that he... ripped his own teeth out of his mouth. And that he needed to feel extreme emotions to make him feel alive. I don't know that person. Everyone has two faces. Face A, which is the public face. The best version of yourself. Honorable, social, political. And then, there's Face B, which is the one you wear to bed. The one you're ashamed of. But it's also the side you feel things with. It's intimacy. Perversion. Pleasure. You look amazing. Thank you. Hey, talking of perversion, did you like that last photo I sent you? I'm not the head of the Catholic Parents' Society anymore, am I? What photo? The photo of my bum. Oh, fuck. I sent it to Mike. Well, it's not like he hasn't seen it before. Hey, what's the problem? We don't send each other photos like this. We don't have sex in the shower. We don't talk dirty to each other when we make love. Why not? I don't know. Because we’ve been together for so long. We... It's a different kind of relationship. We... we're... We're affectionate. We're parents. A parental relationship. - Okay. - I asked him to give me some space. I haven't spoken to him in three days. And now he gets a picture of my bum. What on earth is he gonna think? 'Course. 'Course he is. He's calling me. I'm going to David's house. I'll see you there. Hi, Mike. Hi. I... I got your message. It's, um... inspiring. But I don't get it. Well, it's my arse, Mike. What is there to explain? Yeah, I know, I mean, I get... I get that, but... I don't know, it... It, uh... it’s a bit weird. You've never done anything like that before. It's a sexy photo from a woman to her husband who she hasn't seen in a while. I don't know, maybe I sent it because we've never been apart before. Okay... Look, you were the one who asked me to wait for you. I mean, what's the idea here? I mean, are you trying to make me horny as well? No, I'm ju... I'm just trying to... breathe some life into our relationship. You... you know, just be a bit more spontaneous and... less like parents, and... a bit more like... uh, lovers. Zoe, is something wrong? No, there's nothing wrong. Um... can I call you back later? Sure. I love you. Yeah. Bye. Brother. Here. Right, you’re gonna have to give me a hand... - You got... Oy. - Come on. Go on. - Steady. Steady. - Well done. Well done. Yeah. It looks like David's having a party. I don't give a shit about that. My daughter told Mike that he's got all the photos from Axel's party. We need to get our hands on them. We'd need a court order. Well, can't we just make one up? These people are off their fuckin' heads most of the time. They won't even notice. Isn't it better to wait till tomorrow and ask for them nicely? The photos have been there 20 years. Surely it can wait another 24 hours. Oh, yeah, sure. Tell you what, why don't we all go and have a nap? And then we can go and play frisbee down the fucking beach. Fucking hell. Clint. Clint. What are you talking about? Those photos have been there for 20 years. And yet it's taken my daughter to come out here and find out that Axel was killed at his party. The day he disappeared from Ibiza, he rented a car in the port of Valencia using his passport. Well, it can't have been him. Someone's used his passport to rent the car when he was already dead and taken him to Almeria to bury him. I almost went crazy trying to find out why, a few days before he disappeared, he sold all his property. But the money never appeared. So did you... did you trace the accounts? Did you investigate unusual purchases by people close to him? I expect not. You think English police are much better than Spanish ones. Right, Clint? Or maybe you just think you are better than everyone else. But let me tell you something. Your son was an English asshole. He was a shit who was always high, partying, jumping into swimming pools from balconies. And you? You are the father who brought him up. Stay here. Long as you like. Garden room, sofa, wherever. Thanks, mate. No... I mean it. Anna said I could stay with them at George's place, but we both decided it was a bit of a non-starter. Mm. Mm, mm, mm, mm. Ah. Oh. You know, what kills me is she saw it all. You know, me getting... thrown out of the house like a... total fucking loser. There's something me guru taught me in India. He said you can... spend your whole life searching for who you want to be, but you'll never be happy... until you accept who you are. The fuck does that mean? Well, your whole life, you... you've tried to make out that you're... talented, and famous, and... and rich, but... but you are none of those things. And now, life has put you in your place. Maybe it's time to just start... being you. Do you know what, mate? Maybe it's not such a good idea me staying. Okay. You know, there's only so many yoga chants I can handle in one day, and, you know, the dogs will play havoc with your cow. What will you do? I'll talk to Anna. Maybe I can stay with her till George comes back from his trip. Speak of... Welcome to my home! Hello, sexy. And you, Anna. Hey, David. - You told your friends we were here? - Oi, oi! I didn't think they'd come. Here we are! - Hey! - Hiya. How are you? - How are you? - I'm all right. - Is it through here? - Yeah, right at the end. Kika. Aww! Ohh! Wahey! Oh, God. I want to say... thanks to David for gathering us all here together. To old times. - Old times. - Sí. Oh, oh... You're gonna toast with juice? What's wrong with that? Uh, that's the thing about this island, Marcus, remember? Freedom. That’s why we moved here in the first place, so... Oh! Great! Oh, here’s to Ibiza. To Axel's promised land. And freedom... and hippies. Mind you, these days, you can buy yourself an orgy, so... who even cares where all the hippies went, eh? I want to toast... to Kika's return. Yes! Yes, sir. And because we left it too long since the last time. Really? Oh. It was Axel's party. That was the last time we were all together. He's not here today, but... his sister is. Here's to you, Zoe... I don't need a toast. Come on. Hey, Marcus. Is it just me, or is this dinner getting really intense before it's even started? So many fucking toasts. - It's a bit odd. - Leave it out, George. We're here to talk about Axel. And about the people we no longer are. We're leaving the past behind, and we're moving on. We're embracing our decay. What do you mean, "decay"? Well, everything is worse than it was before. I mean, the world doesn't like to admit that, not with its shiny adverts but really, at our age, it's probably wise that we start embracing the spiritual life. I don't know about everyone else, but my life is much better than 20 years ago. Of course it is, darling. I'm doing great too. But you’re right about the decay thing, David. It’s a shitty feeling to know that... the best times of your life have passed. It’s like, why do we remember our childhood summers? It's because they went on forever. You know, everything was stimulating for the first time, like our first... drink. Our first... boyfriend. Our first fuck. Our first kiss. So amazing. It's true. Our brains are recording everything and... as time goes by, it's harder and harder to find new experiences, and... ...everything becomes ordinary. At our age, friendship is boring, sex is boring... What, sex? Seriously? - I don't agree. - I know. I know. But, I mean, what once gave us pleasure is now boring. A threesome, a foursome, sleeping with someone new, telling them your life story... I remember when you could try any position you liked without asking. Now... - we all do it lying down. - What? - What? - Oh, come on. - Come on! - Speak for yourself, David! Uh, no, I don't believe that. Look... All right. When was the last time you had a... memorable fuck in a... a crazy place, with somebody unexpected... in a crazy position, hmm? Hmm? Yes, thank you. See? David, your theory's bullshit. Sex is the perfect gauge to health and love. And it does not decay. I'll toast to that. - Yeah. - Me too. - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Very good. I think we must be very healthy and in love, Anna. Ooh. Oi, hey, hey. You're a dark horse, George. No, no, look. - He might look like a middle-aged bloke... - Sorry. ...but in his spare time, he's a sexual acrobat. Huh? So... now, what are your other hobbies, now you're retiring? - I paint watercolors. - Yes, you do. - Anna loves them. - Yes, I do. Almost as much as she loves my yoga body. Seriously. So, hey, Zoe, how are you doing? I heard you're trying to piece together what happened to your brother. Yeah. And piecing together my own life while I'm at it. Where are you living? - Um... - She's living with me. Oh! Your holiday romance is with Boxer? Oh, wow! Great! It's fine, Zoe, you know? You're in Ibiza. All people around here fuck a lot. You might fuck lying down, David, right, but I did it in a wheelchair with a broken leg. A lot. With Anna. And it was fucking unforgettable. Jesus, Marcus. Excuse me. What are you doing? Why did you say that? Why did you say that I was living with you? I didn't realize I wasn't allowed. Uh... I mean, you could... you could have said that I was just... staying at your place or living at your place. But instead you chose to say that I was living with you. Like we've made a decision, like we're buying towels, like we're making dinner for each other. We are doing that. I'm married. I'm married! Half those people out there know that. So what are we doing? Because according to your rule book, which says stuff like, "Don't send your husband photos of your ass," according to that, I... - I really don't know what this is. - I don't know what this is either. An adventure. A one-time thing. A holiday romance? Friends with benefits. - Do you know what that is? - Yeah. - I know what that is. - Okay. Good. Please don't go around saying things like that. Whoa. Back there, you didn't look great. It showed a lack of courtesy, of manners. - Do you know what that means? - Oh, no, but I expect you do. It means you looked like a cunt. That's a bit harsh. You humiliated yourself in front of everyone. For one thing, it doesn't even matter. What do you mean? Everybody fucks their ex. I've just been in Ireland fucking my ex, for Christ's sake. Oh, fuck. Let me tell you something. Your problem is not inertia or sex, or your complicated feelings about how your life is slowly slipping away from you. Your problem is... you think something is just beginning... when actually it's already over. I'm the luckiest guy in the world. Why? People spend a lifetime looking for love. They try out relationships with different people and... sometimes they find it at 40, 60. Most never do. I found it at 20, for fuck’s sake. Do you know how that feels? Being so fucking sure that everything's gonna turn out right? - I’m gonna live the good life... - Mmm. Hopefully... my whole life. Of course, my darling. Shit. - What is he doing? - He looks really drunk. He just can't do it himself. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what you doing? What are you doing? I just realized I'm your ex. You know, the guy from your past. I don't want to be the guy from anyone's past, especially yours. Leave George. Look, I've never said it before, but... - No, Marcus. - No, I want you back. Marcus, stop. Don't make a scene. Fuck... Fuck, I don't mind making a scene. I'll do whatever you want. Oh, fucking hell, Marcus! That was from Kathmandu! Fuck Kathmandu! That's enough, right? Just relax. I've spent a year and a half waiting for you to realize you wanted to come back so we could just get on with our lives. But now it's time, Anna. It's time. I don't... I don't want you. Marcus, I want George. What about last few days? You know, look, you... you've been at my place. - Yeah. - No, we made love. Yeah, I know. Because I was helping you. Because you got in trouble with drug traffickers. I needed to look after the children. No, but what about... uh, what about the sex? We've always done that. I guess we always will. Yeah. Hey. If it's what we both want, we will. What's the problem with that? The problem is... it's not enough. - Ooh... Aah... - Aah! ♪ Ooh, ahh, yeah ♪ ♪ Ooh, ahh, yeah ♪ Ah! Fuck, man. What? I can't feel my face. ♪ Ooh, ahh, yeah ♪ Whoa, David! David... Oi! Oi, stop! What are you doing? Why do you always end up bleeding? Come on. Why are you taking something that's not doing you any good? Speed is not your drug. All right? We've all gotta find the right one for us. I'll look after you. Yeah. Listen to me. All of this... tension between us, it's all about Axel. He's come back into our lives because we have never let him go. That's why you're living in the past, mate. Yeah. Do you know what, mate? At least I'm still the same fucking person. At least I can still recognize meself in photos. Who are you, eh? The Dalai fucking Lama? You... you dish out advice to everyone, but do you actually think you're really helping? He's helped me, for sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. Do you know he's an ex-heroin addict? Do you know that, Zoe? Yeah, your brother got him hooked on smack. Sort of like his... little gift. No, I didn't know that. Why the fuck are you telling us this now? Well, she's trying to piece together Axel's life. And do you want to know something else? Every one of you was at his party, and most of us had a reason to kill him. Zoe. Don't listen to him. Yeah. It's like Cluedo. Hey, let's play Spin the Bottle for the killer. Jesus! - Get the fuck out of my house. - If you want me to go, you're gonna have to chuck me out, you twat. Hey. - Oh... - Why don't you drink the water I gave you and you shut the fuck up? Everyone here had a reason to hate Axel. Because he went around screwing up our lives one by one. It wasn't like that. You don't know what you're talking about. No, I wanted to be like him. I wanted to be as great as him, but he... he always made me feel like... I just wasn't good enough. He despised me. No, a... and you, Kika. I mean, how many times did he cheat on you? What does that have to do with anything right now? We broke up, we got back together. It was pure passion, it was all very intense. Well, at least your brother had the balls to burn down his club. - I don't know what you're talking about. - No, look, just relax, mate, yeah? I reckon Axel got off pretty lightly, seeing as you'd just found out he was shagging your mum. - Jesus Christ! - Ahem... Axel was a free spirit. He always wanted more, whatever that was. And, yes, maybe sometimes he didn't think about the consequences, but he just didn't have any prejudices, unlike all of us at this table right now. Prejudices? What he didn't have was limits, Kika. I mean, the man had no shame! Right, he cheated on youwith your mother, humiliated your brother, and me, and Anna. - Marcus, do you know what? - Ooh! Enough! Right, you're being like this because of me. I'm really sorry, right, - but I think it's time to go... - No, what's wrong... Sit the fuck down! What are you doing? Eh? Oh, what, you... you... you don't want me to talk about Axel in front of his friends? Go on then, Marcus. What do you want to talk about? How he betrayed you. How he screwed you over. Even though you warned him against it, - he pissed away all the money. - He was the star. Everything had to go through him. You wanted to help him. No, but in the end, he lost everything. He turned you into a nobody. Just like me. And he turned David... into a... ...into a fucking junkie. Why don’t you just sit down, mate? You're embarrassing yourself. Uh, Zoe, why don't you ask him why he went to Goa? You are a pitiful little shitbag. You're sobbing because Anna's finally chucked you. Tell you what, mate, Axel realized she was out of your league 20 fucking year ago. Do you know what else he knew? That you was in love with him. And you'd do anything that he wanted. Now you go around... giving lessons about how to feel in control of your life. Why don't you write a fucking book about that, eh? Yeah, you can fill it with photos of your last 200 lovers. Every one of 'em under 30, and not one of 'em lasting more than a fucking month. So I'm the loser. And he's the spiritual one. Or maybe, really, you're just the guy that could never tempt Axel over to his side of the street. - Fuck you! You fuck! - Stop it! - I'll have you! - Marcus! Fuck! Marcus! Go on, fucking come on, then! Stay there. Stay back. - Stay the fuck back. - Oh, fuck. - Get the fuck off me. - For fuck's sake. - Fuckin' hell. - Who gives a fuck who killed him anyway? It's what he wanted! Oh, fu... Sorry, what... what do you mean? You... you think my brother killed himself? He was stabbed, run over, and half-drowned. Right, but he could just as easily have died jumpin' off a roof into a pool or drivin' at 300 kilometers an hour or gettin' into a fight or from an overdose 'cause he was a fuckin' animal. He fucked us all over. He loved pain. He loved it. Whatever happened to him... that were assisted suicide. I need to go and clean this. Speed is not your drug. What do you mean, it's not my drug? You always end up violent, hurtin' yourself. It's not about that, is it? It's about having a good time, right? Release. I've got a better drug for you. I'll look after you. Yeah. See. How are you doing? Yeah. Two weeks ago, I would have been in bits, but not now. Turns out I don't know who the fuck my brother was, and whoever killed him probably had good reason. I don't believe that. You know what, I don't... I don’t... I... I don't wanna hear about it anymore. I... I don't wanna talk about it. I was doing really well just not thinking about it. I just want to sit in silence with you painting me. Is that all right? I don't think that's going to be possible. Why? I've been thinking about what you said about friends with benefits. I think I'll pass. At this moment in my life, I need something else. Call me kamikaze, but... I want to be with you. Are you in love with me? Huh! Fuck. Zoe, that... that’s... That's a question that you ask when you're 15 years old. Are you? This thing, it's like... a ladder. You climb one step, and then you climb another, and then one day, you realize you can climb 15 in a row. If you ask me that ten years from now, I will have a straight answer for you, but right now, I'm saying I want to be with you. I just want you to think about it. Huh? Okay. Ohh... Do you wanna know... who I am? I... I make plans. Right? So my daughter will go to such-and-such school because it's good for science. Mike and I will buy and own our own property by the time we're 40. And we do, we have. The present has always been a stepping stone to the future. I've never actually lived in the present. It's easy for you because you do live in the present. But you don't have any responsibilities, you don't have any family. You haven't got anyone waiting at home for you in the club. I don't know if I'm in love with you, but what I do know is that I love what I have with Mike. And the last few days have been the most stupid, self-destructive thing I've ever done. Zoe! Zoe, sweetie, are you okay? Listen, uh... don't worry about Marcus, his ex is getting married, he lost his home. So it's understandable that he is like that. You lot all talk about carpe diem and freedom and about times in the past when you didn't give a shit, but things do matter to you, Kika. Why didn’t you tell me that my brother had an affair with your mum? You lot have got a fucked-up idea about friendship round here, you know that? I don't know, maybe you're all just arseholes, - like apparently my brother was. - I never told you, Zoe, because I didn't doubt, not for one second, that he loved me more than anyone. That's why. I'm so sorry. See you. Oh, fucking hell! Oriol, give me a second, okay? Hey. What are you doing? What's it look like? I'm sleeping in me fucking car with me dogs. Could you turn the light out when you leave? Ah, fuck this. ♪ Seen it all ♪ Hey, what the hell are you doin'? You were my boyfriend's best friend, and I am not gonna let you sleep outside. Need a light? - Ta. - You're welcome. ♪ I'm already there ♪ ♪ Save your books and your pills ♪ ♪ I don't need them, I'm there ♪ ♪ Save your books and your pills ♪ ♪ I don't need them, I'm there ♪ ♪ Hello, hi, are you, yes? ♪ Well, that explains it ♪ ♪ Well, that explains it ♪ Probably didn't expect to see me here, did you? Honestly, Zoe, I... I don't set out to irritate you. Sometimes I can't seem to help it. Well, I didn't go back to Manchester, obviously. I got as far as the ferry and I turned back. But, yeah... I was here 20 years ago. I met Juan Miguel Fonseca and investigated the disappearance of your brother. I've been with him this week, actually. Finding things out. And you were right. We can't leave an open wound. When I said that, I didn't know who Axel really was. I’m starting to understand - why you hate him so much now. - No, no, no, no. There were bad things about Axel, but I tell you what... there were some amazing things about him too. What am I to you? The most beautiful thing in my life. You're my fucking goddess. I wish this could go on forever. I'm sorry, but I live in the present. If you wanna live in the future, I'm not sure this'll work. You never talk about the past either. I hated Axel. He was my son, but I hated him. Yeah, for... yeah, for being happy all the time. And writing his music and throwing parties when all I could think about was your poor mother, God rest her. I couldn't even get out of bed. And I couldn't understand why he kept laughing... when all I wanted was to die. My mum was the most important person in the world to me. She gave me music. When I was, like... eight, she let me play the drums as loud as I wanted in the living room, even though the neighbors were all complaining, calling the police. She never made a fuss. Even when she got cancer and she had to go through treatment and all that chemo... and her hair fell out, she... she'd just play music. And she'd say to me... "Don't let grief catch you, Axel. Run faster." Said she didn't like to see me cry. And she told Zoe that... her headscarves were some fashion trend thing. She'd make out like everything was all right, everything was gonna be fine, so that Zoe wouldn't worry. And after she died, I did the same thing. I didn't cry. I think that pain got stuck there somewhere. Maybe that was just your brother's way of expressing his pain. And it's taken me a long time to get me head round that. But now, I reckon that... I reckon your brother was just running away from the same pain that I was feeling. I'm sorry I never got the chance to say it to him. Now, all I can do is find the bastard who killed him.
