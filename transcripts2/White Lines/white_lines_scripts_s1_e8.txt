 Dad? Dad, where are we going? We're at the airport. Hi. - What are you doing here? - I sent you a message, and you never replied. I know you wanted space, Zoe, but our marriage is floundering, and I'm here to rescue it, give it mouth-to-mouth. That's what it takes. If you don't want to go back to Manchester, we won't. We can have one of those... nomadic sort of marriages.

 You know, we can live here one day, in Thailand the next. I want to smash up my life, Zoe, and I want to do it with you. Jenny! Oh! Oh, I've missed you! - I missed you! - Let me look at you. - Hi! - Hi! Oh, I really needed this. Just a normal family day at the beach. It's super normal. Your lover told us - you were living together yesterday. - Fuck off! Yeah, well, anyway, whatever was going on with me and Boxer, it's done now. I asked Sissy to go and get my things from his place.

 And I know, at some point, I'm gonna have to tell him that I've had an affair. If it's not that bad, why are you gonna tell him? So we can get on with our lives. I feel like it's the only way we're gonna get through this stronger. Are you saying that the thing that you had with Boxer was just sex? - Yeah. - Yeah. So do you tell your husband every time you masturbate? People think that they're gonna solve all their problems by being honest, but sometimes all it does is screw everything up even more. Look at Marcus last night. Do you think he's... feeling better today knowing the truth? No. Yes! Mike's hot. ♪ So you wanna party? ♪ ♪ So you wanna dance? ♪ ♪ You better know someone Than know someone of our friends ♪ ♪ You wanna get higher? ♪ ♪ Shake that thang ♪ - Hola. - ♪ Spinnin' round and round ♪ ♪ And round and round like that ♪ - ♪ I put a little twist in my hips - ♪ Here we go ♪ - ♪ Kiss on my lips - ♪ Here we go ♪ Can I help you? Oh, hello. I'm Zoe's father. Hey. I'm Bruno. Sissy, darling... Follow me, papi. Wait here. Can I, uh... - Can I give you a hand? - No, no, no, no. No, no. Are these David's pictures? Who lives here? I don't understand you. Hey. We've come for Zoe's things. Get off the island! Mr. Ward? Mrs. Calafat! Kika's invited me for a few days, just till I sort out me living situation. I'll leave you to have a swim. Oh, hang on. Um... I need to go over there. Come here, boy. Come here. Oh, whoa! Pancho, get down! - No, no, no! Don't worry. - No. - I'm sorry about that. - No problem. I lost mine a few weeks ago. The best and most noble creature I ever had. These two belong to my wife. They're the only ones that stuck by me after everything else went to shit. Hmm. Shouldn't we separate them? I suppose so. They're both male. In fact, I think they're half brothers. Do you know what? Let 'em enjoy it, eh? Good luck to 'em. ♪ But I can't remember... ♪ Difficult time? Yesterday, I thought I'd got me life back with my wife. Today, I've lost me house, I'm living in my Citroën, and my wife's getting married to her arsehole boyfriend. A right cunt. If it's any consolation, my own love story was on the rocks for 20 years. But now I'm a eunuch, there seems to be something there again. - Right. - I don't know if it's grief or love, but I don't really care because she's with me. She smiles at me every day in a way she hasn't smiled for a long time. Maybe it's because she's drunk most of the time. Ah. But I like her so much, I don't care. ♪ Or maybe shooting stars... ♪ Do you mind if I smoke? No, no, no. Of course not, my boy. Just a bit of hash. I hope you don't mind the smell. My goodness, that smell takes me back 30 years. Oh! No, no, no, no, no. It's not even ten in the morning. Come on. Ahh... Thank you. Whoa! Whoa! Wow! Whoo-hoo! - It's pretty strong! - You're out of practice! Good morning. Good morning. Dad, can you come with me? I need you to sign some documents. Uh... Of course, son. No, no, no, Mr. Calafat. That's all yours. - You fill your boots. - Okay. Thank you. Sorry, son. I'm sorry. Mmm! Mm. You know what, Dad? Last night, I was at a dinner where... Sign here. ...where everyone spoke to each other totally openly. Mmm? They got out all their anger and frustration. And it was very liberating. I'm very happy for you, son. - I'm very happy. - It might sound crazy to you, but... I think our family should do the same. Mm-hmm. Get it all out in the open. Clean out the shit that we've been sweeping under the carpet for 20 years. I know someone who could help us. Whatever you want, son. How do you want it? - Loose? Tight? - Uh, loose, please. Can I have a look? You're not my baby anymore. I'm so happy you're here. I've missed you so much. How are you guys doing? Are you sure you are okay in the guesthouse? It's bigger than our house in Manchester! Anna, where are you taking them tonight? Remember that she's only 14. Uh, sorry, sweetie, but right now, we might as well be sisters. With a bit of makeup on and me on her arm, no doors will be closed. Good evening. - You look great, Jen. - Thanks. This little beauty is my protégée. Is that pot? Yeah. Why? Do you want some? I'd rather they did it at home. Keep it in the family, rather than smoke crap you get out there. Just because it's okay for people to do it on this island - does not make it okay for you. - Oh, God. - Do you understand? - Just don't freak out, okay? I'm just gonna dance. I promise. - Right, girls. Let's go tear it up. - Okay. I love you. - I love you. - I'll see you later. - Be careful. - I will. And have fun. I will. I love you. You're looking very smart. I have a date. Oh, yeah? Who with? A bombshell from Manchester. And I've booked for us... a romantic dinner at the most swanky, foodie place on the island. And afterwards, if you're up for it, maybe a bit of... Whomp, whomp-whomp... Beep-beep-beep... Can I tell you something? I mean, I know this restaurant is gonna be fab, but... do you wanna know what this girl from Manchester really wants to do tonight? I'm all ears. George has charmed his way through round one, but will the girls still think he's gorgeous Georgius once they learn more? Ladies, if he's for you, you know what to do. All right! Not a bad round. Still 21 with their lights on. Let's find out what's going on here. Leanne, why is the light shining? You've been saying for two weeks you wanted new experiences, that you wanted to do things you've never done, and as soon as I get here, all you want to do is watch TV and eat greasy pizzas like you do back home. Do you wanna go for a dip? - Aah! - Mmm! Thank you. For what? For being here, and... trying to understand me, and... for being so patient. Yeah, I survived, right? Besides, whenever I was feeling down, your dad was always there to tell me I was a waste of space. You know, I get it. - What do you get? - Oh... I get what's happened. You find out about Axel. You come here... to this unbelievable place... with these crazy people... in houses we've only ever read about in magazines. Ah, and you think... that when you come home that it will all just be the same as it always was. But it doesn't have to be. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Zoe, what's wrong? What's the matter, sweetheart? I've lied to you. When you asked me if... I'd met someone in Ibiza and I said no. I'm sorry. - Mike... - Zoe, do you know... do you know what? It doesn't matter, all right? I... I love you, and I don't care about anything that's happened. Do you still want me? Yeah. Are you okay, mate? Yeah. Oh, dinnertime. Sorry, my friend, but three days of your sausages and beans is too much for a Spaniard, mate. My love, you're in the middle of nowhere! Thank you very much. Mm! Hey, Clint! This is Milena. Hello. Hola. Delighted to meet you. - Mwah! - Hello. I'm Milena. Hello, there. Gaz-pa-cho! Soup. Here you go, my love. - Cold soup. - Cold, cold. - Mmm! - Right... Ah, that hits the spot. Oh! Listen!

There's something odd about this red Alfa. Looks like someone moved it... and then put it back again. Eduardo, I need a favor. I want you to check a license plate. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. And the last few days have been the most stupid, self-destructive thing I've ever done. Morning! Hello. Still in your night-before clothes? Yes. I am! Do you mind if I, uh... - No. Help yourself. - Thank you. So... how was it? Yeah. How did it go for Charlie's Angels? Oh, honestly, you would not believe the energy that they have got. They made me feel so old. They're still going. - What? - Mm-hmm. - You left them on their own? - No! Of course not. I left them with these super cute boys that we met - at Amnesia. - Anna! - What? - She's 14 years old! What's goin' on? Jenny's not come home. She's coming home. She's with Tanny. Hi. This is Jen. Leave a message. - Oh, God. - It's her voicemail. - Mike, have you got any messages? - No messages. Anna, can you call your daughter, please? Yes, Zoe, I can call my daughter. There was only an hour left of the club. - You have no new messages. - They'll be back soon. Tanny's 16. - Chill out. - Nothing. - It's Tanny. Leave a voicemail. - Oh. No. It's voicemail. Do... Zoe, relax. They're just having a good time, exactly like we had a good time when we were their age, remember? - There's nothing going on. - If there's anything I've learned about this island, there is always something going on. - I trusted you! - Do you know what? Maybe my hangover's kicking in, but when did you turn into your dad? Sorry. What are you saying? You think... You think you're a better parent than I am? Your words, not mine. Listen, you might think that letting your daughter go out and party all night and doing drugs in your house, having sex with different boys makes you a brilliant mum, but do you wanna know what it looks like, Anna? It looks like you are desperate for your daughters to forget that you only spend a few months of the year with them. You of all people should know what a mistake it is to lock up a teenage girl. Because when she does finally grow up, she's gonna be stumbling around going batshit crazy just like you. Anna, please. Where did you leave them? Exit. Boxer's club. Do you know where that is? Right. I'll go and get her. - Yeah, I'll come with. - No, it's fine. I... You really think I'm gonna wait here while you go looking for Jenny? Come on. Let's go. I like to call these sessions... "Let It All Hang Out." Now, I can understand Spanish better than I can speak it, but please feel free to share in whichever language you please. In the next hour, I want you to say the things you've never said before. Things that you feel deep inside. There's been damage... in the past. But now is... is an opportunity to talk about it and... release yourself from the suffering. Okay? Okay. So... Who would like to go first? Mm-hmm... I'll begin if you like. Yesterday, I saw my dad smoking a joint with a stranger. Laughing. He's never laughed like that with me. Ever. I want to say that I struggle to feel comfortable in this family where anyone... can get on better with you than I do, Dad. My sister has spent half her life away from Spain, yet she comes for a weekend, and you make her CEO of the company. A company I've been running for ten years. For which I've prepared myself, I've applied myself, I've worked my arse off to get Mum's casino up and running... I know you don't trust me. But I don't know why. Look... I didn't ask Kika to be CEO because of her intelligence or her business acumen. I know she isn't qualified. Then why? Because she has something you don't have, Oriol. A pair of balls. Forgive me for speaking so frankly, son, but isn't that why we're here? You're always the runner-up, and you suffer because of it. You've spent your fucking life begging for affection. That's a sign of weakness. And all because you couldn't stand Kika being the center of attention. That's not true. Please, Oriol. When you were little, you asked your mother to dress you in your sister's clothes. Is that true? It was just a childhood thing. Oriol was jealous of his sister because she was so funny in her flamenco dress, so he wanted one too. I put it on him to make him happy. But Andreu went mad. Of course. He was five. I didn't want the kid to be confused about his sexual identity. For God's sake. He was envious of his sister. He wasn't about to ask for a sex change, Andreu... Mum, we're not talking about sexual identity. We're talking about identity, full stop. You fucked up my brother's life. Why don't we talk about that? What are you talking about, Kika? Oriol is bitter because he has spent his life doing exactly what you wanted. You even managed to break up his marriage. You couldn't stand her, and you didn't stop until they separated. Oriol got married too early and to the wrong woman. What was I supposed to do? Applaud? It wasn't Mum's fault. We split up because the relationship was crap. We argued all day. One day, Mum crouched down... and she realized that Mum was wearing the same underwear that you'd given her. Oriol, you gave her your mum's panties, for fuck's sake! Mum excites you, right? What are you saying, Kika? What are you saying? This only works if we lay all our cards out on the table. I don't know... I like the way she is. I admire her. And you wanted your wife to wear her panties because it excites you, Oriol. For the love of God, Kika. You want to sleep with Mum. Kika, please! All our cards... on the table. Openness. Honesty. Courage. Say it, Oriol. This therapy was your idea. David told me that you carry all this suffering. It's because of the guilt you're carrying, brother. Let it go. I'm attracted to Mum, yeah. Zoe! Come on. Make way. Hi, Bruno. Come on, make way. Hi. How are you? I can't wait to finish. My foots are killing me. Who's the older guy? Uh, yes. This is my husband, Mike. Oh. What's up, harpoon girl? Hi. Hi. Um... Uh, we're just here looking for our daughter, Jenny. She came here last night with Anna's daughter, but she never came home. Anna said she left them here, but she's not answering her phone. Uh, sorry. This is my husband, Mike. This is Boxer. Hey. Hey, isn't that Tanny? - Look. - Yeah. Tanny, have you seen Jenny? Um... I don't know. Um... She left with some people. What do you mean? Where did she go? I don't know. A party? Give me back my phone! Get the fuck off me! Stop! - What are you doing, man? - Stay still! She'll be at the private party. Is there a problem, Boxer? No, no, no. Yeah. If he doesn't give my girl her phone back, we'll break his face. Let's have a look at your messages. All right, dickhead? Don't be stupid, give me the phone. Give me the phone! What the fuck are you doing? Give him back the phone, or I'll smack you. What are you going to do? Kick me in the shins? She's at a party on the other side of the island. Get the fuck out of here, all three of you. In the parking lot, now. Here. I've got the address. Let's go. Give me the fucking mobile. Now! I'll give you your mobile if you suck my cock. Let's go. Mike! - Mike! - Hey, you want another one? Thanks. I'm not a violent person. I... I don't want you to get the wrong impression. I've never hit anyone in my life. Well, it wasn't really a hit. More like a slap. It was a really... really good slap, though. The other day, I watched a slapping contest on YouTube. They were, like, Siberians, I think. You know, strong guys. You wouldn't like to be slapped by those guys. They have, like, a championship every year. A slapping championship. You could sign up for it. Once upon a time, there were a man who... who desired a woman so much... that he killed her husband. But then... one day, he found out that the man he killed were his father. Which meant that the woman he'd married were his mother. He were called... Oedipus. Perhaps a son... ...wants to kill his father... in order to possess his mother. How barbaric, for God's sake. It's my fault. It's my fault because I... I could have prevented the problem. I could have nipped it in the bud, or at least talked about it. But it wasn't a pleasant subject. What was I supposed to say? "Why are you spying on your mother, Oriol?" Since when has all this been happening, Oriol? Since when? I don't know. Since you were 12? More or less, yes. And when you were a teenager, you'd say, "Do you mind if I sleep in your bed, Mum?" Right in my face. In my face, as if I were an idiot. And you would share a bed with her. And you would get an erection. Did... you notice anything, Conchita? Do we really have to talk about this? Yes! We do have to talk about it. It's not the boy's fault. Oriol has been the one who has loved me most in this family. With no ifs or buts. No conditions. Did I notice he had an erection? Yes. And could I have ordered him out of my bed, one way or another? Yes. But I didn't know what I was doing in those moments. I was half asleep. But I do know that sometimes I moved my arse a little. And he was a teenager. I didn't have to move it a lot to sense the dampness after a short while. Fucking hell, Mum! You've just outdone yourself. I don't even know what to say. Come on, Kika. As a mother, you want your child to be healthy! And to have his first wet dreams at home. You're pleased that he's able to ejaculate because it's a sign of health, that everything's working properly. For God's sake, there are people who masturbate their pets. Vets recommend it. Is a child less important than a cat? Ohh... Thank you, Conchita. Mr. Cristóbal! There are some gentlemen asking for you. They say they're from the police. I can hear you in stereo, Manuela. It's incredible in surround sound. It's the bomb! Whew! Inspector Juan Miguel Fonseca. Speak slowly and move your lips. I'm still getting used to it. Cochlear implant. Cutting-edge Japanese technology. The audio is connected to the nerves in the ear. I'm the fucking cyborg DJ! Mm-hmm. All right. Is this car yours? Yeah. It's in my father's collection. Hmm? It looks like it's been involved in an accident. I don't understand. The Spider never leaves the garage. How long have you owned it? Eh? Speak here. How long have you owned the car? Since the '90s. Look at it! No one has touched it. Ta. What are you doing, man? Look, just let us do our work, and don't fuck with us. Do you understand? Or do you want me to say it closer to your fuckin' ear? I feel so proud of you all. So grateful that you invited me to be your companion on this... purifying and cathartic journey. Do you feel lighter? That's the suffering that you've freed yourselves from. No more secrets. There is one more thing I'd like to share with my family. Oriol, there've been enough emotions for one day. Why don't we leave it for next week's session? Let him speak, Kika. Don't keep anything inside. I'd like to talk about Axel Collins' birthday party. The son of a bitch was fucking my sister. He was fucking my mum. He was making life difficult for us with his clubs. I hated him. Enough, Oriol! On the night of his party, he proposed a challenge. Each of us had to think of a way to fuck with the other. I told him... he didn't have the balls to pull out a tooth with a pair of pliers. Axel! Axel! Axel! But the bastard did it. Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! Axel! My go! You like tattoos? A tattoo for a tooth? You are really an idiot. Boxer does it... but I get to pick it. Whatever you want. So I had no choice but to accept what he proposed. He... told me to get a tattoo. Ooh! [laughing[ This one. After that, I felt so humiliated, so messed up that... I took heroin, pills, everything they offered me. - Look. - What's that? There. Do you know who this tooth belongs to? Well, I would bet you my right arm... that it belongs to my son, Axel Collins. - You knew him, didn't you? - Yeah. Eh? Well, someone drove him away... ...in that fuckin' trunk, covered in blood! No! For fuck's sake! You're all obsessed. Oriol Calafat burst my eardrums to make me confess to killing him. - But I didn't. - Fuckin' liar! - Who was it, then? - This car wasn't mine 20 years ago. Someone sold it to me. Who? Hey! Who sold it to you? Who sold the car to you? Oriol Calafat sold it to me. His father used to give him boats, cars, motorbikes. Oriol Calafat. So that night is pretty hazy to me. But when I woke up the next day, I found blood in my car. Fuck! Fuck, fuck! Fuck! Fuck... I think that... at some point that night, I killed Axel Collins. Oh, fuck! Fuckin' prick. Sorry. Look, I didn't mean to disturb you. Look... I'm your new pool guy. No, look, I... I just thought I'd make meself useful, you know, seeing as I'm here. - Can I have some of that, please? - Yeah. You all right? - Ta. - My family has turned me into an emotional wreck, Marcus. We form relationships based on what we learn at home, and... How's my brother supposed to be a normal person? How... How am I supposed to have a normal relationship when my mother used to fuck my boyfriend when I was 16 years old, and she thinks it's okay to jerk off your son like he's a fucking cat? Fuckin' hell. I dated this guy for six months, and it was all going well. Yeah? And... ...one night, he told me he wanted to have a baby. And I smiled. And I said I needed to go to the bathroom. Told him to order me a gin and tonic. And instead, I left. Got in a taxi, went home, blocked his number. I thought he was the wreck, but... actually, it was always me. Well... Well, recently, I've been feeling like I was worth about as much as this fag butt. Now it seems like I've got some company. Did you just compare me to a cigarette butt, Marcus? Asshole! Okay, 'cause that's just great! This is a private party. - My daughter is in there. - Uh-uh. It's not worth it, mate. It's a sausage fest in there. - What's he saying? - It's a sausage fest. Hey. Stop fucking around. Don't you know who I am? Huh? I've had enough of this. No more macho-ism. No more fighting. No more slapping. I am going in there to get my daughter. Do you know why? Because she's underage. Hup. How does she seem to you? Who? Zoe. Good. Why? She's been clubbing a lot, right? She seemed to know everybody back there in the nightclub. What are you really asking me? It's you, isn't it? ♪You can dance into my heart ♪ ♪ Now I know that's not the part ♪ ♪ That you want to steal away ♪ ♪ So when the morning comes ♪ ♪ There'll be nothing left to say ♪ ♪ Baby, let me love you for tonight ♪ ♪ I got to have your love ♪ ♪ I really need it now ♪ ♪ Baby, let me love you for tonight ♪ ♪ I got to have it now... ♪ Jenny. Jenny! What are you doing here? - We've been so worried about you. - I'm fine, Mum. Why did you leave the club? Why did you leave Tanny? Because she's a moron. Well, did you two fall out? What happened? No, no, it's... it's not her fault. She just told me something about you. I got angry. That's all. What did she say? Don't matter. It does matter. Tell me. What did she say? That you hooked up with a nightclub bouncer. And that you're living with him. Her mum told her. Is it true? Jenny. Jenny, wait. Will you just let me explain? Are... are you trying to take her away from me? It'd take more than a couple of good shags and some tattoos in... whatever it is. I've got a family with her. And no one risks all that for some nightclub bouncer. This is Ibiza. I've seen it all here. I'm not like you, man. A shit eater. - A what? - A shit eater. Building a family home while his wife is living la vida loca on Ibiza. Yeah, but you know what? If I'm not careful, I'm going to end up just like that. And what the fuck is that supposed to mean? There's not going to be a love story with Zoe. We're traveling in different directions. Jenny! Sorry, excuse me. Would you... Would you stop so I can try and explain? What? What are you gonna tell me then, Mum? That it's all been a holiday romance, and you'll come home as if nothing happened, it'll all be sorted out? I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. I can't. I can't. Why not? Because when I'm with you, I feel like I'm cheating on someone else, and I... I don't know what that means. I don't... I don't know if that means that I'm supposed to be with that person, but I know... I know that it means that I can't be with you. I'm sorry. When you arrived, I've been trying to pretend that everything's fine, and not believe that my life is just falling apart. But, Jen, sometimes things just break. Oh, no, Mum, they don't break! Things don't break if you don't get together with someone else. You can fix things if you actually want to fix them. You told him you had to find what happened to your brother. Instead, you went to live in a club and started screwing a bouncer. No, it's not like that. - It... I wasn't... - You lied to us, Mum. - I don't know. - Are you making fun of us? No! Maybe you just couldn't wait to get out of Manchester. Is that it? You're tired of Dad, - and I'm just part of the package. - No. Or maybe you just got tired of being a mum? You had me when you were so young. I dunno. Maybe you never wanted to have me in the first place. No. Don't say that. I'm sorry, but how am I supposed to believe you? How am I supposed to believe anything you say? I don't even recognize you anymore. - Dad! - Jenny! One moment, please. Okay.
