 I reckon I must have lived more in the last 24 hours than in the last 24 years. A torrential rain just washed everything away. Do you how long it's been since it rained in Almeria? It's a desert. In Spain. You know this more than anyone. I was just a kid when my brother disappeared off the face of the Earth. But I knew that one day I'd find out the truth. That the missing pieces would fit together and then the wound would heal.

 I would heal. I didn't realize how destructive the truth could be. Until now. Inspector Juan Miguel Fonseca. Mike Walker. This is my wife, Zoe. Crazy place, no? They filmed spaghetti westerns here in the '60s. You know, Sergio Leone? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly? Uh, sorry. Today it's a theme park. What's the plan? Identify the body? I'm afraid it's not that simple. After 20 years and the desert being so dry, it has actually mummified the body.

 But a tattoo is visible, similar to your brother's. What tattoo? This was taken two months before your brother's disappearance. - Uh... He must have got it in Ibiza. - So, what do you want us to do? We have a flight back to Manchester at six o'clock. We need to run some tests. Uh... Oh... Sorry for this... Come here. All right? - Okay? - Uh, just give me a second. It's Axel. He didn't leave. He didn't give up on me. Axel was murdered. I hate this fucking music. Sissy, darling. Bring me some breakfast, will you? Coffee and muffins... Are you for real? Boxer! I need you for a couple of minutes. Tell me. I'm looking at the body painting. I've got the zebra and tiger sorted out, but come and look at this. What do you think of this? A snake. I don't like snakes. Crocodile! No, Bruno! Stop fucking around. No snakes, no crocodiles. All right, all right. Come here, come here. Look. They're dancers. People look at a dancer and dream of fucking them. That's it. Huh? Sorry. I adore you. Thank you. Who is this? Axel Collins? Okay, I'm on it. Thanks. ♪ Maybe it's the moon ♪ ♪ Or a stolen glance ♪ One, two, left. ♪ Or the sweet and sultry way we flirt ♪ ♪ Every time we dance ♪ ♪ 'Cause with every breath ♪ ♪ We keep fallin' in love ♪ I know you can do better, Conchita. Yes, I know. I've been a little distracted today. Welcome, all. Dear citizens, dear mayors, dear regional councilors... Dear gamblers, dear addicts and gangsters, we're gathered here together... Andreu! What? They're the people who go to casinos, right? This is serious, Dad, we've got a lot at stake. We need to convince the investors. If you really want to convince them, son, take off your tie, roll up your sleeves and talk to them face-to-face. They are countrymen, neighbors, they're just like us. Andreu, those neighbors could frighten the investors. I know some of these guys from school. I'll tell them what I think, and we will come to an understanding. And what I cannot manage, the lobster stew will do for me. All right. I'm taking King for a walk. Come on. Come on, King. Mr. Thompson... Nevada Diverse Holdings. Dear Mr. Thompson, Nevada Diverse Holdings. Dear Mr... Correct. Las Vegas Table Resort. You'll do very well, darling. Thanks, Mum. Darling, until everything is signed, all our clubs must be clean. Yes? I know. I'm on it. Do whatever it takes. Okay, my boy? Mm. Mm. How's it going, Boxer? Morning, sir. Has something happened? They've found a body on your land. Mummified. Which land? In Almeria. Go, King. Sir, they think it's Axel. Axel Collins. Why do they think that? Well... it has a tattoo on its chest with Kika's name. Yaah! If the autopsy confirms it's your brother, we can start repatriating the body. What happens next? Do the English police investigate? Mrs. Walker, first we must work out if he died around the time of your brother's disappearance or sometime later. What difference does it make? If he was murdered more than 20 years ago, there will be no investigation. Why not? In Spain, you cannot be prosecuted for murder once 20 years have passed. Let me just get this straight. You're saying... there's a possibility that the case might not be investigated at all? How come you have that picture of him in your folder? - It's from a police investigation, right? - There was an investigation in Ibiza at the time of his disappearance... Why, if everyone thought he went to India? You must settle for what I tell you, okay? What would you do if I just took the folder and ran out of here? Zoe. I know. - Spanish cops carry guns. - Easy, Zoe. Seriously? So whoever did it, you can come out of hiding. All is forgiven. What a relief. Have a party. Invite some friends. Maybe there's someone else you want to bump off. I don't care what the Spanish police say. As far as I'm concerned, Axel just died. Just tell me one thing. If he disappeared in Ibiza, what's his body doing in Almeria? Mrs. Walker, we haven't yet established that this body is your brother. I know it's him. First we must do a DNA test. There you go. Here's my DNA. Mike, will you just sign whatever he needs? I've got to get out of here. I can't breathe. "She's too sensitive." "Don't tell her the truth, she can't take it." It's all I've ever heard. From my father, my husband... you. All thinking I'm gonna flip out. Come off the rails. Maybe that's just who I am. Maybe I just need to let it out. Excuse me. Do you know how I get to Ibiza? Where are you goin'? To Ibiza. Listen, I know you want answers, but this is not the way. - I'll be fine. - Yeah, but for how long? We've worked so hard, Zoe, - to make you... - What? Stable? Yeah, stable. Sorry, remind me, am I talking to my husband or my nurse? You're talking to the guy who picked you up when you couldn't get out of bed. I've lived our whole marriage with the ghost of Axel. I won't let it destroy you again. Let's go home. I can't. I can't, Mike. It's my brother. I need to know what happened to him. What am I supposed to say to Jenny? She has her exams. I'll phone her. Please, Mike. I'm gonna be okay. Everything that happened, it... it's in the past. You have to trust me. Of course I trust you. But you have to promise me, if anything goes wrong, - you will call me, all right? - Mm-hmm. I'm only a couple of hours away. - You promise? - Yeah. I promise. Try and get your hands on a wheelchair for me, will you? Because your dad's gonna break my legs - when I return home without you. - Yeah. Mm. Music? Mm-hmm. I love this song. ♪ Amor de compra y venta ♪ ♪ Amor de en el pasado ♪ ♪ Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem Bem, bem bem bem, bem bem bem ♪ ♪ Bamboleo bambolea ♪ ♪ Porque mi vida Yo la prefiero vivir así ♪ ♪ Bamboleo bambolea ♪ ♪ Porque mi vida Yo la prefiero vivir así ♪ ♪ No tienes perdón de Dios ♪ ♪ Tú eres mi vida la fortuna del destino ♪ ♪ En el destino del desamparado ♪ Hola, little sis. We just got to Ibiza. Aah! The light here is amazing. It's like in a movie. Music playing everywhere, it's like our soundtrack. And dancing isn't just for the weekend, it's... like a religion. The sea is incredible, turquoise, emerald. Once you turn 18, you're coming to live out here. How did we survive so long in Manchester? Please remember to take all your belongings with you. I feel like I'm breathing for the first time. No more silence at home, no more feelin' down 'cause Mum's not there. We won't apologize for having a good time ever again, Zoe. And I'm telling you... everyone on Ibiza will know who I am. Who says you can't want it all? We're gonna start something big here. ♪ Alo?

How was Shanghai? Fucking great. - Yeah? - It's a wonderful city. Best thing about Shanghai is the toilets with LEDs so you can aim your piss when it's dark. The seats are warm. They're heated. Who the fuck wants to sit on a warm toilet seat? Fucking hell. Tell them about the jet of water. When you've finished, there's a high-pressure jet that leaves your ass immaculate. I mean, like a baby. Fuck's sake. I don't want a moist arsehole, I want it dry. - We're talking about a hot jet, Marcus. - Don't want any kind of jet in me arse. Especially after it's been cleaning your arse. - Do you have a thing about your anus? - What? - For sure he's got a thing about his anus. - No, I haven't. Fuckin'... What the fuck are you on about? People who've got a thing about their anus, it's normally because they're confused about their sexuality. Oh, fuck off. Fuckin' nice one. Fuck you! Hello, guys. How are you? Everything okay? - Marcus. - Oriol. Everything okay here? Shall we go over there? Let's go. - Got your fucking ass. - Fucking prick. My family's clubs... will be free from drugs until I say otherwise. Yeah. It doesn't matter what you want. How about what the people want? Fucking right, mate. We're preparing a big police operation, so the island needs to look really clean until the casino deal is complete. Think of it like you're fishermen and you're... you're taking a break to protect the fish stocks. - It's a lot of money we are talking about. - I own 11 clubs. Think I don't know how much money you make? Fuck's sake. Look, if we don't sell, they're gonna bring it in anyway. How can you separate drugs from music on Ibiza? My mother goes to the opera every week and she doesn't take drugs. So believe me, Marcus, it is possible. Are you gonna start playin' opera in your clubs? You may get your casino, but you'll lose your clubs. Me and my brother Mikaela have not come here - to sunbathe. - You threaten me, Johannes? Because we all know how you get your expensive Afghan drugs here. On a ferry, in a fruit truck. Or you, Marcus, with your water sports business and your fucking banana? If we can't move this forward in a sensible way, it's going to lead to arrests. Look, okay. Look, food for thought. I gotta pick up me kids. You can DJ in my clubs all you want, but no dealing. Marcus? You wouldn't want social services taking away your girls. All this for your mum's fucking casino? It's much more than a casino, Rafael. We'll have auditoriums, exhibitions, opera... We're enriching the social and cultural life of Ibiza. You need to keep calm. It's going to go well. I'm worried they'll be put off by the environmentalists. What do these people do for progress? Paint their breasts at bullfights? Gorgeous... Mariluz, my love! What did we say the other day? Don't-put-your-fingers-in-your...? Bodily... orifices. Very good. Give me a kiss. Eh? Eh... Conchita, blessing a casino in God's name must be the worst thing a priest can do. Apart from pedophilia. I don't care what you priests get up to in your spare time, Rafael. This is a friend asking another friend. And as your friend, I must ask you to take no for an answer. I shall not take God's name in vain just to suit your business. Hi. We're closed. Um... I... I'm just looking for someone. Uh... He DJs here. His name is Marcus Ward. He's not here. Do you know where he is? Or... or where he lives? I'm not telling you that. Why? Ever heard of data protection, darling? Come to his set tonight. Bye, mate. Um, it's just the thing is, someone that we know has died. Um, a very good friend of ours, someone that we both loved, and I don't really want to tell him just as he's about to go on... You haven't got a clue what I'm saying, have you? Okay. Okay. Okay. Right, so listen up. Mum's over from London. The plan is, you'll stay a week with me, then a week with her. - All right, sweetheart? - But will Stepfather be there? No, no. No, don't... don't call him that, right? He's called George. Is that so difficult? They're not married anyway, all right? Do you really think Matilda living with Mum is a good idea? You know she's running one of her parties? You nervous? To be honest, yes. It's my first orgy. Orgy. That is too vulgar a word for what's gonna happen here tonight. Sex is a minor part of this evening. What is much more important? Desire. Egypt, Rome, Greece. Their elite classes had nights like this all the time. Why? Because they knew that life is best lived through the senses. So, tonight... we are the guides. We are. For every moment of every minute, you will make sure that they want you more than they have ever wanted anything before. Believe me, a sexy glance beats a blowjob every time. Hmm. Where is your father? Welcome, everyone. Our guests from America. Our guests from the island. Mr. Calafat will be joining us shortly. Please take a seat. I'd like to propose a toast... To the casino! To the casino. We should head off, sir. It's been a long time since I went to the movies. I used to enjoy it so much. I was one of those people who used to cry at films. Now it's the done thing. Now you're a sensitive type, but before you were seen as a sissy. That's why I always sit in the front row. In films, everything is easy. This guy's going to be ruined, that guy's a bastard, this one's the killer... But in life... In real life, you can't see shit. Boxer... you're much more than my head of security. I've always trusted you, and you trust me. That little miracle of life is called loyalty. I asked you this a long time ago, and now I'm asking again. Do you know who killed Axel Collins? No, sir. Someone buried that kid on my land to fuck with me. Or maybe the truth is sadder. Perhaps my own wife and son go around burying corpses. So you're turning Ibiza into a new Las Vegas? Doesn't Monte Carlo sound a little better, Antonio? The casino represents progress, not just in terms of jobs, but in addition, a chunk of the profit will be invested in local housing. The Calafat family have always had a social conscience. The casino will be open 24/7. With customized legislation to exploit the workers. I'd like to know - what Andreu thinks of all this. - Funnily enough, that's him now. Dad, where are you? Oriol, did you kill Axel Collins? Dad, we're waiting for you. Are you a murderer, my boy? Andreu, are you okay? What's happened? Did you have Axel Collins killed and buried in our land? You're not able to make it? Don't worry. We'll talk later. Boxer, I need to know who killed the English kid. I'm not talking about snooping round like some private investigator. Do you understand? It's no time for kid gloves. Come, King. Perhaps he ate something. Open the gate for me, darling. Yeah. - What's up, man? - Wait. Dump it in the kitchen and take a shower. All right? - Fuck you doing here? - I took all this shit down to San Antonio, they said take it away, so what am I to do? It's just a bit of politics. Hide it for a while. I'll call you. Nah, you're just gonna fuck me over. You think you've got problems? How am I supposed to pay me fucking mortgage? What the fuck am I gonna do with a banana full of cocaine? - Hide it under my bed? You take it. - Here! Have you lost your mind? I'm not keepin' a load of fuckin' coke where me daughters live. Take it away, or give it back to the Romanians. The Romanians? I'm not fuckin' off those cunts. This ain't my fuckin' problem, Marcus. Just put it in your garage. Marcus. Come on, man. Here, baby. Come on. Here! Well, fuck you, then!! Fuck. What the fuck are you doing? Told you! What the fuck? No, no, no, no, no. No. No. You fucking cunt. Fuck. Fuck you. Fuck. Oh, no. ♪ High tails ♪ ♪ And low tails ♪ ♪ Love has ♪ ♪ Knowledge ♪ ♪ Story ♪ ♪ Upon story ♪ ♪ Thought I ♪ ♪ Could believe ♪ Dad! - Oh, Jesus. - Are we eating out? Uh... Yeah, go and get dressed and we'll eat at the harbor. Dad! There's someone at the door, Dad. Can I help you? Oh, you don't remember me. Zoe. Zoe? I don't wanna go, Dad. - I've got things to do. - I know, but... - We'll have dinner tomorrow. I promise. - Yeah, well, you're so desperate, you change all your plans just to fuck some girl. No, she's just a friend who's here on holiday. So keep your trap shut, all right? Or I'm taking your phone. Love you, baby. - Thanks for doing this, Sofia. - No problem. See you later. Teenagers, eh? Yeah! Have you eaten? No. Come on. Blast from the past. Uh, don't mind this, uh... Kids were desperate for a football pitch. It's an amazing place you've got here. Anna and I bought it a couple of years ago. Then she fell for someone else, and now she runs high-end sex parties... leaving me with a big mortgage. - Cheers. - Cheers. You okay? I'm fuckin' great. I'm a 44-year-old DJ, I live in Ibiza. Most of the time, I wear flip-flops. I'm the man. I remember you bouncing up and down in your booth like a Duracell bunny. I still do that. Come tonight and check it out. I... I can't jump as high since I did me knee in. Mad dog. I will never forget those sessions in Manchester with David and Anna and... Axel. The best was at your house when your dad was at work. We used to pray for him to go on night shift. Zo? What do you want to do? Sleep... or dance? I used to get you out of bed, do you remember? Yes! - The special guest for the evening... - ♪ I cannot bear to see you leave me ♪ - Zoe Collins! - ♪ I'm begging you, don't go ♪ ♪ Lead the way, lead the way ♪ ♪ I cannot bear to see you leave me ♪ - It was all such a laugh. - We had a little help. We were just gettin' into pills. ♪ And though you tell me That you love me ♪ - ♪ Sometimes I just don't know - ♪ Sometimes I just don't know ♪ ♪ Don't know, don't know ♪ ♪ I cannot bear to see you leave me ♪ ♪ I'm begging you, don't go ♪ ♪ Please, don't go... ♪ Axel just... played and played. Searchin' for the right beat, recordin' it. It's how he became who he became, the fuckin' master of Ibiza. You seem a bit sad. The truth is, you know... If you live like a god when you're 20, how can you be happy after that? You've had it all. Love, girls, the perfect life. After that... how can you not be sad? Good times are always behind you. I'll take the bread. Is David still in Ibiza? Oh! You wouldn't recognize him. He runs a hippie retreat. How long are you here? It kind of depends. Well, look, if you need a place to crash, seriously... this place is yours. Thank you. Good evening. Hey. To heaven. Cheers. Cheers. Good to see you again. Do you remember the last time we spoke, Marcus? It was about 20 years ago. Hey, Zo. Axel just called. Oh, yeah? Well, where is he? India. What's he doing there? He wasn't in India. No? Well, I mean... That's what he said. How do you know? Because he was buried in the desert. Murdered and then buried. So it seems pretty weird that he called you. What the fuck you talkin' about? - Murdered? - Why did you lie? I've gotta go, but listen. Your brother's fine. He sounded happy. I did it for you. Take it easy, kid. I'm sure he'll call soon. Look, I knew how messed up you were, waitin' to hear somethin'. But how did you know he wasn't gonna call me? Because you knew he was dead? No. I didn't know. No. I... How would I have known? Look, something's going on with the dogs. Just... You carry on, don't... don't wait for me. Hey, Pancho. Come here, boy. Pancho. Oh, my God, you're on the toot. No, no, no. Sylvester. Come on, get away, boy. Come on, get away. No, no, no, no. Come on, shoo, shoo, shoo. Shoo! Pancho. Get off. Get... Fuck! Get off, Pancho. Pancho! Get away! Christ Almighty! Fuckin' hell. This isn't happenin' to me. Hey, buddy. - Eh? - How are you? I always wanted to try this. Plant a line of cocaine in the garden and water it until it grows. I mean, every narco thought about it, but you? You've actually done it. - Come here. - Yeah... Yeah, the surfer threw a load of fucking coke over the fence. - Anyway, what are you doin' here? - Ah, nothing much. Just came to see how you were. Hey! Hey, buddy. My little coke fiend. Come here. Come here. Can I have a beer? So... what sort of thing are you playing tonight? All my years as a DJ, you've never once come to prep me beforehand. Hmm. What the fuck? This is warm. - Shit. - What the fuck are you doing? It's glass! Me kids swim in there. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? I asked you this many years ago, but we didn't know each other so well. So maybe you didn't think I was being serious. Who killed Axel Collins? - I don't fucking know. - Perhaps we should refresh your memory. Come here, fucker. Come here. Second round... - Same question. - Boxer, stop. Who killed Axel Collins? Was it you? - I don't know! - Marcus. Marcus, you have to try to answer, before your lungs fill up. Come here, you... It's the last one... Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck. No! I... I... I was his best friend. I... - I raised the alarm when he went missing. - Oh! Look, I was desperate to find him, for fuck's sake! How long are you going to keep up with this bullshit? All I want is one fucking name. - I fucking hate this fucking shit. - Okay. Fuck. Boxer, stop. Stop, Boxer. Oh, fuck. You're gonna fuckin' kill me... - Just tell me one name. - Listen to me, right? Just stop. - I don't know anything. - Oh. You don't? - Are you going to tell me? - Just stop. Okay. What the fuck? Get him out. Who the fuck are you? Oh... I didn't know Marcus had moved on. You know, after everything with Anna, I'm really happy for him. I said get him out. Ah, no, relax, he's just free diving. He can reach eight or nine meters catching octopuses. He has a water sports business so he's quite used to water. That's great, but I've gotta ask him some questions, so I'll give you to the count of three. - One... - Yeah. ...two... - Oh, for fuck... - Hey, whoa. Calm down. Three. Okay. Hi! Joanna. Zoe? How long has it been? - Six years. - How are you? Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right. I'm in Ibiza. I'm in hospital. Is that blood? Yeah. It's not mine. I, uh, shot someone with a harpoon. A hit man who was trying to drown my brother's friend. What's going on, Zoe? Okay, don't freak out. Um... All that work that we did on my abandonment issues was pretty much useless. I've just lost Axel all over again. I reckon I've lived more in the last 24 hours than in the last 24 years. Joanna? He didn't abandon me at all. Axel was murdered. So everything that happened... ...everything that I did, it... it was all because of something that didn't even happen. - There was... was this torrential rain... - ♪ When you were here before ♪ ♪ Couldn't look you in the eye ♪ ♪ You're just like an angel ♪ ♪ Your skin makes me cry ♪ ♪ You float like a feather ♪ ♪ In a beautiful world ♪ ♪ I wish I was special ♪ ♪ You're so very special ♪ I bless this land in the name of God Almighty. ♪ And I'm a weirdo ♪ ♪ What the hell am I doing here? ♪ ♪ I don't belong here ♪ ♪ I don't care if it hurts ♪ ♪ I want to have control ♪ ♪I want a perfect body ♪ ♪ I want a perfect soul ♪ ♪ I want you to notice ♪ ♪ When I'm not around ♪ ♪ You're so very special ♪ ♪ I wish I was special ♪ ♪ But I'm a creep ♪ ♪ I'm a weirdo ♪ ♪ What the hell am I doin' here? ♪ ♪ I don't belong here ♪ ♪ Whatever makes you happy ♪ ♪ Whatever you want ♪ ♪ You're so very special ♪ ♪ I wish I was special ♪ I'm gonna stick around here with Marcus. ♪ But I'm a creep ♪ I don't trust him. ♪ I'm a weirdo ♪ He's definitely hiding something. ♪ What the hell am I doin' here? ♪ ♪ I don't belong here ♪ ♪ I don't belong here... ♪ Dad?
