 [lively instrumentals] [song intensifies, then fades to silence] [indistinct chatter] [mellow instrumentals] - [clicks button] - [ringback tone] Come on, Ellie, pick up. Hey, it's Ellie. I'm not available right now, but if you leave your name... [Nina] Excuse me, how much longer? Hmm. Should be just another five minutes. You said that five minutes ago. Hi there.

 Sorry for the waiting. This department's not used to handling much more than the occasional noise complaint, or petty theft, or van... [exhales] Detective Daniel Matuko. Nina Locke. I'm the one who found Joe. - Yes, I know. I was... - Can we talk in private? Oh, sure. My office. - Offer you some coffee or a fresh cruller? - [receding footsteps] No cruller. Have a seat. I'm very sorry about your friend. I didn't know him very well, but Joe was a beloved man in this town. Which is why I wanted to speak to you the other night at his house, but they told me I had to wait.

 I was actually planning on calling you today to follow-up. - We're still investigating Joe's death. - It wasn't suicide. He wouldn't do that. Like I said, we're still investigating Joe's... Joe was murdered. What would make you think that? When I was there, the door was unlocked. [stammers] It was open. Most of the doors in this town are unlocked. I heard someone in the house. Did you see anyone? Any evidence that says somebody else was there? Well, no, no, but... he left me a voicemail an hour before I found him. Hi, Nina, it's Joe. I, uh... [sighs] I just saw something. But I can't explain it. I think I just need to show you, I'll be home all night. - [beep] - What do you think - he planned on showing you? - I have no idea. But that's not the message someone leaves who's about to kill themselves. Joe had absolutely no reason to commit suicide. I saw him that night. He wasn't upset about anything. If anything, I was the one who was upset. About what? You might've heard that I... [sighs] I lost my husband recently and Joe was helping me... try to make sense of it. Listen... I don't want to sound dismissive, but I've got to go with the evidence. And the evidence strongly points toward suicide. - That said, - [heavy sigh] we will take everything under consideration. What about Ellie Whedon? Have you talked to her? Sorry, Mrs. Locke, I can't give you any more details. Is this Joe's? Yeah, we found that on his desk in his home office. He said he had to show me something. - It could've been something in this box. - I'm afraid I can't let you do that. But you have my word, I will be in touch as soon as I know more. [Nina sighs] [receding footsteps] [Duncan] Rendell, no! [whacking] [key tings] [key rattles] So crazy, right? We just saw him and now he's gone. [mellow instrumentals] [Tyler] You never know what's going on in someone's brain. That's true. Hey... do you still wanna come over later? Yeah, of course. Okay. [Scot] Okay, so we have a big problem. - The climactic demise of Nephropidae. - [door closes] The first cut came out a bit rubbish. What, don't think we cracked the lobster? - [laughing] - [Scot] Good one. But it's not all bad news, however. - I found another solution. - And by "I," you mean... [Scot] We, sorry. None of this would've been possible without the brilliant Kinsey Locke. I'm sorry, none of what, exactly? Oh, I've written a few extra scenes that I really think will make this thing sing, and Kinsey and I have already shot one. [birds chirping] And how's that? All the equipment's in my van. [stammers] Well, we... Kinsey had a work around. - [phone chimes] - [Douglas] Shit. What is it? [sighs] We lost the Matheson Docks. - As in they... they sunk? - [Douglas] As in Mr. Peña, the owner, won't let us film there. Why not? He doesn't wanna deal with potential liability... Blah, blah. See, there's a reason no one wants to shoot in Matheson. This town is so not ready for it's big break. [groans] Okay, it's fine. It's okay. We will find something else, all right? We have to, okay? This is the pivotal scene. This is our hero's epic showdown with Nephropidae inside his lair, okay? Let's think on it and regroup tomorrow, all right? [bag thuds] [birds chirp] [sharp exhale] [items rattling] [dramatic instrumentals] [zipping] [clanking] [whirring] - [light scratching] - [approaching footsteps] - [light clanking] - Hey, Kins! Where's Tyler? He's hanging at his girlfriend's tonight. [scoffs] Gone for a few weeks and I miss all the hot goss. Whatcha got there? I want to show you something. Does it bother you that you don't remember pieces of your childhood? [clicks tongue] I don't really think about it. I think your brain forgets old memories to make space for new ones. What do you want to show me? [rustling and zipping] - [items clank] - [whirring] What are those? They're memories. I think they're your memories. Well, how did they make... Who made these? I know this won't make any sense, but... I think someone took them out of your head. [opens lid] [twinkles] I wanted you to look at them to see if you remember anything about them. Duncan? What is it? What do you see? [breathes heavily] Feels so familiar, but I... I don't know what I'm looking at. - [rushing effect] - [sharply exhales and groans] [sighs] Oh, I feel really queasy. [continued sighing] I'm sorry. This was a bad idea. - [clanking and zipping] - What was a bad idea? [Nina] Dunc? Can you give me a hand with dinner? Yeah, I'll be right there. Excuse me. - [Duncan clears throat] - [dubious instrumentals] [pop music plays faintly through speakers] [fire crackles] Hey. You good? Yeah. You've been staring at that same photo of a coelacanth for an hour and I'm just wondering if I should be jealous. Just... something on my mind. Like what? [whacks book shut] What I would rather be doing instead of homework. [kissing] [key clinks and rattles] I didn't realize you were rocking some bling under there. - Sort of. - I didn't mean to embarrass you. No, no, you didn't. Um... I just... I should get going, actually. Sorry, did I do something wrong? Oh, no, not at all. I just, uh... lost track of the time. - You're sure? - Yeah, of course. [zipping and rustling] Okay, but you'll be there Sunday, right? Set-up's at two. Yeah, definitely. [kisses] - [door squeaks open] - [descending footsteps] [door closes] I have to show you something. Can't it wait? No, it really can't. [ascending footsteps] I tried talking to Duncan about what happened with Dad. I even tried showing him his memories, but it didn't work. [crickets chirp] Adults can't remember magic. We already know this. And by the way, you shouldn't be doing that shit without us talking first. But it wasn't like what happened with Mom, though. Even while he was watching the memory, it was like, his brain couldn't process it or something. My brain can barely process it. But there was one memory he totally fixated on. - [bag hums] - [items clank] - [jar twinkles] - [Tyler takes a deep breath] - [waves rushing] - [seagulls caw] [indistinct chatter] What am I looking at? [Kinsey] That's Dad and his friends going down into the caves. [curious instrumentals] Look at this next part. - [low humming] - See that blue light? Something happened to Dad and his friends in that sea cave. I want to go down there. By yourself, to chase after some weird blue light? I'm not gonna go by myself. [lid clanks] I'm asking you to come with me. No. We don't know what we saw in that memory, Tyler. We don't know what Dad did! Sure seems like he killed his friend. It was a moment. We don't know what happened before. Or after! If we go down to the caves, - maybe we can get some answers. - Kinsey, stop. - Our Dad's not a murderer! - [yelling] Kinsey! [breathes heavily] I'm done with this. - Meaning what? - It means... [stammers] I'm done. I'm done with Dad, I'm done with these evil keys! [key thuds and rattles] They're all yours. [birds chirping] [solemn instrumentals] [hushed chatter] Why are you avoiding me? Nina, this isn't the time or the place. You should've picked up one of my calls. You're hiding something. Outside, now. What do you want from me, Nina? You and Rendell have the exact same scar. I know you didn't get it from a bike accident. That's what this is about? How'd you get it? [Ellie scoffs] We did it to ourselves, okay? Me, Rendell, Mark and Erin... senior year after our friends died, we pressed a hot poker to our chests. It was a way to remember them. Well, why wouldn't you have just told me that when I asked? Because it was none of your business, that's why! [stammers, sighs] It was a private, intimate thing. - Now, if you'll excuse me. - The night Joe died, where were you? [scoffs] [stammers] I was home. No, you weren't. I went to your house and talked to Rufus right before I went to Joe's. You weren't there. What exactly are you accusing me of, Nina? Just say it. Look... [stammers] I cared about Joe. Twenty-five years, Nina, that's how long I've known Joe. You've been in town all of what, a few months? So don't talk to me about caring for Joe. [dubious instrumentals] I tried really hard to be your friend. [crunching of footsteps] - [suspenseful instrumentals] - [squishing] [Zadie scoffs] Wow. [Kinsey screams on screen] [Zadie] How the hell did you do that? [stammers] It's a... time lapse effect. - [continued screaming] - Yeah, great work, guys. It's magical. [Douglas] I mean, yeah, it's cool, but let me be the one to state the obvious here, I mean, what's Nephropidae doing chasing Amanda through the woods? He's a sea monster. [sighs] We've been over this, Douglas, okay? He's both water and land based. No? Look, what we really need to be focusing our energy on is finding a new location for our final showdown. Okay? Now, there are no bad ideas. - Go. - We could build one. With what budget? We could construct miniatures and then film it in bathtubs. I stand corrected, there are definitely bad ideas. - I thought this was a safe place. - Well, I'm sorry Douglas, but we're making a monster piece here. I have an idea. What if we shoot in the sea caves? Uh... [laughs] I don't think that's a good idea. You know that they're nicknamed the "Drowning Caves" for a reason? It's really not that scary as long as you're careful. I've been down there before, it's insanely cool! No, it would be a bitch to get all our equipment down there, so... There are rumors that place was like a government site. What if there's radiation or something? I don't want to grow a third arm. You guys are being such killjoys right now. Come on! I actually love this idea. [laughs] I mean, where's your sense of adventure? Yeah, you said yourself, you don't want it to look like some cheap, hacky, home-made film, right? Well, obviously. Okay, unless someone's got a better idea, I vote sea caves. [distant chatter] All right, sea caves. Let's do it. [floorboards squeaking] [hushed, indistinct whispering] [sighs] [curious instrumentals] [hushed whispering intensifies] [key cranks] [key clicks outward] Okay... [latch clicks] Okay. [key clinks in lock] [cranking] [click] Perhaps this is a Narnia situation. [door squeaks] [serene instrumentals] Whoa. It looks just like our world. Morning, kiddo. Want some cereal? [gasps] You found the key! That's great. I found that cabinet in the basement a few weeks ago. - There's nothing magical about it. - Well, not yet. Wait till I refinish it. - [approaching footsteps] - [Kinsey] Hey, Mom, do we have any flashlights? Mm... Try the closet upstairs. What do you need them for? [phone chimes and buzzes] [clicks button] Hello? Hi. This is Detective Mutuku. Yes. Hi, Detective. We found no signs of forced entry. No robbery, no fingerprints on the bag other than Joe's or yours. No physical evidence inconsistent with him killing himself. We interviewed a number of people that were close with him and all of them described him as being lonely. [box thuds] This upcoming weekend was the anniversary of his wife's death. You're ruling it a suicide? [sighs] Yes. Okay. - Is that it? - Uh. I didn't find anything in here. Just some photographs from when he was a yearbook adviser. Given that they're no longer evidence, you're welcome to have 'em. Thank you. - [door opens] - [Duncan breathes heavily] Hey, Uncle Duncan, do you wanna go outside and explore? I wish I could, bud, but not now. I'm sorry, I'm still fighting this migraine. I think I'm almost on the other side of it. I'm gonna have to take a raincheck, okay? Okay. [heavy sigh] - I'll be outside. Hope you feel better. - Mm-hmm. - [birds cawing] - [wind blowing] [whoosh] [suspenseful instrumentals] [sharp crescendo] Hello, Bode. What do you want? I'm going to give you one last chance to give me the keys. Never. And I know you can't take them from us. You have no idea what's coming. [ominous instrumentals] It's gonna destroy your family and you'll be the one responsible.

[officer grunts] [officer groans] [officer screams in agony] [distant police sirens] - [song stops abruptly] - [phone chimes] [birds chirp] [mellow instrumentals] [keyboard clacking] [phone whistles] [Duncan] Hey, I'm taking off. My headache's finally eased up, so... What is all this? I'm looking for something. [Duncan] Can I help? I don't even know what I'm looking for. but... I'm not crazy. Who said you were? Ellie. I think messed things up with her. I accused her of something, and I don't know. Maybe she was telling me the truth. - Truth about what? - I wanted to know about this scar she has. It's the exact same scar that Rendell had. Do you remember that? Right here, by his collarbone? [birds chirping] Not really. Another thing you don't remember? - [exhales] - I don't know, maybe the answer's not in this box. I just know... that something feels off here. I think you need a good night's sleep. - [chuckles] - I'm sure that's true. Why don't we round up the kids, I'll drive us back to Boston tonight, Bryan and I will take the kids out, and you can just rest. Thanks. But, you know, I'm okay here. [Duncan] Okay. Talk in the morning. Hmm? [Nina] Sure. - [dramatic instrumentals] - [waves crash on shore] [water dripping] - [Kinsey gasps] No way. - [laughing] [Scot] Man, it really does feel like some otherworldly creature could be lurking here, huh? [laughs] Exactly. Come on! [Zadie] Now, this is cool. I mean, kinda scary, but really cool. [laughs] Pretty awesome, right? - Yeah, it's amazing. - [Zadie] Yeah. Yeah, the Matheson Docks are just like, a super embarrassing memory right now. [laughing] [Scot, distant] All right, what if we put the camera here? We can catch the shot of this dramatic entrance. [Douglas, distant] That's perfect! Plus we get all this nice lighting in the back side. - [Zadie] Shall we set up? - [Scot] Yeah. [hushed, indistinct whispers] [Scot] Kinsey, you got the tripod? Kinsey? Kinsey? - [waves crashing] - I think we should keep going. [Scot] What? No, no, no, no. This place is perfect! No! - There's a better location further in. - [Douglas] Yeah, I don't know about that. That tunnel looks a little... hard on the ankles. And it's wet. Yeah, and we'd have to bring all this equipment down there. Yeah guys, seriously, I... I don't want anybody to get hurt, and I don't think I have phone signal here. Look, I'm telling you it's safe. And it's gonna be totally worth it. Trust me. Sounds like she knows what she's talking about, guys. For Nephropidae, right? [tripod clatters] [bag thuds] [water splashes] - Kinsey, just wait a sec. - [water spraying] [feet whack surface] After you. Never question my commitment to my craft ever again. [laughs] I only said that because you were the one who insisted on shooting - from your dad's freaking La-Z-Boy. - It was the best angle, okay? - [Zadie] Really? - Yes. [Douglas groans] - Oh! Take the head. - [Scot] Guys. [distant yelling] [Scot] Yo, guys. - [heavy breathing] - [tripod clatters] [Kinsey] Here. [Gabe] Hey, wait up, huh? [Gabe exhales and grunts] [wind rushing] - [water splashes] - [Kinsey exhales] [hushed, indistinct whispering] [dubious instrumentals] [Gabe] Holy shit. - [Zadie] Oh, my God. - [Douglas] Whoa! [laughing] [Douglas] Yeah, okay. Yeah, you were right, Kinsey. [Zadie] Wow, Doug gave his approval. This, my friends, is a miracle cave. Told you guys. [Gabe] I can see Nephropidae crawling out - from, like, right over there. - [Zadie] Oh, I love it. What do you think, Scot? Scot? Oh, sorry, I was... just practicing my Oscar speech - in my head. - [laughing] [Scot] All right, let's do it. Get set up. [indistinct chatter] [breathes heavily] [indistinct whispering intensifies] [formidable instrumentals] [omega whirs and hums] [whispering intensifies] I could get used to having a lair. [Zadie exhales] - [water splashes] - What the... [stammers] I don't understand how... [water sloshing] Uh, guys? What is happening here? [suspenseful instrumentals] Oh, shit. I think the tide's coming in. We're already in so far. How can it get all the way in here? Well, it's the ocean, Doug. It's pretty bloody agile, yeah? Pack up everything, we're leaving now. [Scot] Oh, man, this really isn't good. Where's Kinsey? Kinsey! I'm gonna go get her. I'll get her. You guys go. - No, we'll wait! - No, that's putting everyone else in danger. Get out of here! I'll meet you. [Gabe] Kinsey! - [Douglas] He'll be fine. - [Gabe] Kinsey! [whirring and humming] [breathes heavily] - [door rattles] - [Kinsey sighs] - [water dripping] - [gasps for air and coughs] We can't wait, we have to go now! - What about our equipment? - Leave the stuff... We have to swim. It's flooded all the way to the other cavern. Yo, let's go! No, no, no, I don't think I can do that, okay? - Maybe if we just climb high enough... - There is no high enough, Doug, okay? This thing is filling up and it's filling fast. Okay? If we don't go now, I promise you we will drown. Okay, now me and Zadie will help you. Let's go. [suspenseful instrumentals] [yelling] Leave your bloody shoes, Doug! Let's go! [Gabe] Kinsey! Kinsey, come on, we have to go. The caves are flooding. Kinsey, we have to go. - What are you doing? - Get off me! [heavy breathing] - Okay. - [Scot] Nice and steady. Oh, my God. It's cold! - [water sloshing] - It's really cold! We've got to swim to the other cavern. It's coming up. - [gasps for air] - Here it is. All right. Okay. On three, okay? Just take a deep breath and don't stop swimming. One, two, three. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! [gasps for air] [heavy breathing] Okay... - [gasps for air] - [Gabe] Kinsey, the cave is flooding! If we don't go right now, we're both gonna die. Come on, please. [heavy breathing] Kinsey, let's go. Come on. [low vibrations] [suspenseful instrumentals continue] - [feet shuffling] - [heavy breathing] [Kinsey] Oh, shit. [Gabe] I told you. We can do this. [Kinsey] My flashlight's waterproof. I'll go first. [pants] [gasping and coughing] Oh, my God, I made it. - I can't believe I made it. - What about Gabe and Kinsey? [panting] [water sloshing] [gasps for air] [gasps for air] [bubbling] [gasping and coughing] - [Gabe] You okay? [coughs] - Yeah, just a little farther. - [Gabe] I don't think we're gonna make it. - Yes, we are. [sharp inhale] - [Scot] Kinsey! - [Kinsey coughs] [Kinsey pants and gasps] [Douglas] That was fun. - Why didn't you tell us that could happen? - I didn't know! Even though you're such an expert on the caves? [yelling] We could've all died! I know, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, but at least we're all safe. We lost all our gear! - So? We'll replace it! I'll replace it! - With what money? Kinsey, do you know how many hours of scooping ice cream it took me to buy all that stuff? You said you wanted a good location, so I... - Oh, bullshit! You left us down there! - ...was just trying to help. Did you even care about this film at all? Why are we even here? I have more to worry about than this stupid little movie, okay? [water sprays] [heavy sighs] [somber instrumentals] I never should have trusted you. Never. [inhales sharply] [waves crash] [takes a deep breath and exhales slowly] You saved my life back there. You know that, right? I would've drowned. Well, I'm sure you would've done the same thing for me. Besides, I can't really blame you. I mean, that door was... [scoffs] What the hell was that thing? I don't know. I think it has something to do with the magic, and the keys. What, you might have a key that opens it? No. I... don't really have anything. I don't even have the Savinis anymore. Just... give them some time, they'll get over it. [scoffs] Sure. I should never have made you guys go down there. [sighs] You didn't make us do anything. No, I did. I lied about knowing about the cave. Well, I, for one, am glad we did it. I'm serious. What else would I have been doing today? Filming some crappy little scene in Doug's basement? Doing homework? I mean, I'm excited to be alive right now! And not just because we almost drowned, but you just... [takes a breath] you have that effect on people. You have this energy that I think we'd all follow, anywhere. I mean, I would. [birds chirping] You're a badass. [Kinsey scoffs] I don't feel like a badass. I like this Kinsey.
