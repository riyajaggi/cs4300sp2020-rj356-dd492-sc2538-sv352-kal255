 Thank you for having me in there. Yeah, of course. - So you want to hang out? - Not tonight. - Busy? - No, I just... haven't decided what this is yet. I couldn't be who my father wanted me to be when I transitioned. The idea of who's conducting your life, that hit me like a brick. I think I have a crush on Curtis. Ever since my son went away to college,

 I've been having these crazy fantasies. Well, what are you gonna do about it? Oh, my God. I am so sorry. - I'm gonna... just gonna go. - Don't be sorry, I'm fine. - Oh! Yo! - Hey, dude. Where've you been? I've been worried sick about you, honey. Um, just midterms. I'm living at the library lately. - So, uh, yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh, what are you up to...

 Might wanna crack a window or something. - Hello? - Oh. Amanda, hi. Um. I, uh... I'm so sorry, I... I'm not... I'm not feeling very well today. I think I'm not going to be able to, uh, make it in to work. Oh, okay. What's going on? Yeah, uh, I think it's just a nasty cold, but yeah. I think I'm... Oh. Uh... Gotcha. Well, um, feel better soon, okay? Thank you. Uh... So, how are you, um... How are... How are you doing? Uh, I'm good. Eve... Um, listen. About the other night... Don't worry about it. Okay? Um, we... we'll just pretend like it never happened, all right? Oh, God. Thank you so... Thank you, Amanda. I... I... I feel the same way, so I'm glad. - Okay, great. - Okay. Um, enjoy your sick day. Okay, Eve? Okay. Uh-huh. Bye. I'm spanking you to teach you discipline in how to be the person you want to be. Right? Yeah, okay. I'm doing you a favor. I know. What do you say? Oh, thank you! Are you going to be a better person from now on? Oh, yes, thank you! - Hmm... Ow. Ooh. "Why don't you take it?" "I don't want to take it." "Take it." "Yeah, you like it?" "Do you like it now?" Fuck. Ow. "Tell me if you like it now, bitch." Ooh! Ooh! "Take it, bitch!" Aah! I don't know if I like it. "Tell me you like it. Tell me you love it!" Ow. I thought Melted Swiss broke up? No, Louisa and I broke up. Melted Swiss is very much still together. That's the guy that I was talking about. Oh, that makes sense. What does that mean? It means you like to fuck with basic white guys - with pink dicks. - Seriously? I... He's cute though, right? Uh... - Hey! - Hi. How long have you worked here? I've never seen you here before. Uh, I've been here since day one. - Oh. - I just take the early shifts - so I don't see the lazy people. - Mm. I'm not lazy. Just sleepy. - Oh, yeah? - Uh-huh. - Why are you so sleepy? - Um, you know, the pursuit of excellence. Just constantly, you know, pursuing, and then achieving excellence. So, um. Doing anything fun this week? Uh, yeah, I think I'm gonna go to a party tomorrow. - Oh. - You? I dunno. I was thinking... I was gonna go with you to that party. Oh, did someone invite you? I feel like somebody wants to. So... Okay. Well, then... I'll see you tomorrow. Oh, for real? - Cool. - Cool. Okay. See ya. - Jesus fucking Christ, Chloe. - Yeah... Did I tell you we're going to Turks in Caicos next month for a little romantic getaway? No, you didn't. I am so jealous. I know. We need something. We are in the middle of such a dry period. It's been quite a while. Okay, when you say "quite a while," what... what do you mean? God, I don't wanna say. I don't wanna say my number till... Will you say yours first? Okay. Three. Three weeks. Three months? Three hours? Fuck. Okay. Okay. Well, look, my number is your number minus two. Years. Not great. N... None of this is great. I mean, this has gotta help, right? - Ooh, fancy. - Yeah. So, we only have the ocean view room one night, it's 495, and the rest of the time we have this garden view. You wanna get a drink after this? I don't feel like going home. Oh, I can't, honey. I have my class. - This is gorgeous though. - Oh, my God, with this class. How's it going? Um, it's... good. Um, we've got this, uh... Well, I'm supposed to write this essay called... It's called a turning point essay, where you're supposed to take a moment from your life where you had to... make a decision that... that somehow d... led you to become the person that you are right now. And I'm having the hardest time trying to... - find that moment. - Sounds a little depressing. Excuse me? I'm sorry, I wanted square, not round. Well, I can't wait to read it. I am second-guessing this color. Okay, you have my notes on your first drafts. Now it's time to revise. Think of it as, um, a second chance. So, you know, uh, really do the work. Don't phone it in. Be honest, because otherwise, this is just a complete waste of fucking time. So... uh, good night. Hey, who wants to get a drink? Uh, I, uh... Not tonight, but thanks. Hey. Hey hey. - Sorry about all that. - No. Just that night at the bar, I really thought there was something there. - Yeah, I saw it. - Right? - Yes. - And then we hung out, and... This is always what fucking happens. If... If a straight guy starts getting feelings for a trans girl, it's off to the races and then all of a sudden, just out of nowhere, bullshit existential crisis of masculinity. Okay, are you sure that that's what's going on? - No. - Okay. No, I'm not sure that's what's going on. Oh, God, this is why I'm a writer, I cannot tell the difference between what's in my head - and what's out here. - Hm. For instance, I made up that Curtis and I had a special connection and that he'd want to go to a party in Brooklyn with me tomorrow. Whatever. What about you? What's going on? Can I go to that party with you? Brendan? Come in. Wow, you're early. Yeah, sorry. No worries. Just tell everyone I woke up like this. Wow. It's... very decorated in here. Uh, I do my best. Can you stop snooping around my room and sit, please? I dunno. I think you left one of your sex toys out. Have you even tried one of those? No. Don't even try to fight it. Uh, what is this party? Maybe I should have told you this before, but... it's a BodyLuv underwear party. Uh, what is that? It's about body positivity. It's just naked people who wanna hook up. Oh. Cool. Okay. So, let's turn around, get undressed, and on the count of three, we'll look. Okay. Okay. Okay. One... two... three. Fuck you! - Okay. My turn. - Mm-hmm. - Come on, let's go. - Okay. CHEERING) God, we are by and far the oldest people in this party. - Oh, my God. - So many mustaches. What about him? He's tall. Yeah, I don't trust those architect frames. Yeah, there's something a little vaguely fascist about it. - Ah, no, thank you. - Okay, you know what? There's no one cute here. I am officially deploying my air bag. Ugh. - Oh, stop it. - I give up. - Stop it. - No more sucking it in. Well, fuck. - Hey. - Hey. I made it. I thought tonight was tough for you. Yeah. Moved some things around. - Hey, Eve. - Hi, Curtis. So good to see you. Hi, you look so nice. Well, thank you. So do you. Both of you. So, I'm just gonna take a quick lap. - You're good? - Yeah. Yeah. - See you. - Good to see you. What about him? I love the tie, I love the boxers, I hate them together. What about her? Oh, my God, she's trying way too hard. - She's trying so hard! - What about me? Was I trying too hard? No. No, you're a really good dancer. I was trying really hard. What's wrong? Nothing. I... That's... My roommate's here. Zack's your roommate? No fucking way! That's Harrison, my best friend! - Uh... Okay. - Come on! You guys, we're all connected. Chloe! Are you on molly? No, bitch. They live together. Hi. Uh, could I have a bourbon and rocks? Oh, signature drinks only. Okay. - I'll have the Otessa. - Same. So, what's happening? Why are you here? Uh, you invited me. Yeah, and then you said you couldn't come. You know, I wasn't sure. Wasn't sure. Curtis, have you ever dated a trans person before? 'Cause I'm not doing a thing where a guy is half in and half out. No, but that's not what's happening here. I have no hang-ups about who you are. Let me ask you a question. Have you ever dated a black person? Yeah. Oh. Okay, then what's your deal? What is this? Well, my deal is I drove an hour and a half to Brooklyn to see you. On a weeknight. Thank you. - Well, okay. - Yeah? - Glad we got that cleared up. - Yeah? Oh. Oh. Wow. - I'm sorry. - You should be. - I got a little greedy. - I can see that. How can I make it up to you? You could get me a drink. Of course. What will it be? White wine. With ice. No "please"? - No. - Oh. Well, aren't you bossy? Why are you still talking? - Mm, dinner's on Zack. - What? Why? He's the slot machine champ. Okay, being completely honest, I spent all my money before we even left Foxwoods. No. Yeah. I was so drunk. He bought me sweatpants that say "slut" across the butt. - I did. - Ew! When did you guys go to Foxwoods? Um... I'm gonna... go to the bathroom. I gotta go, too. Hey. You could've told me. You know that, right? We talking about Foxwoods? No. The... other thing. We're roommates, you know? Friends. Why would you keep something like that from me? It's all good, man. So, uh, do you live around here? No. - You're a writer? - Nope. What do you do? I watch a lot of porn. Oh, my God. Grab my ass. Grab my ass. What else? What else? Get on your knees. Hello? Hurry up. - Where do you live? - Not too far. Take me there. How are you eating chicken at a sushi spot? I don't like food from the water. You should try it. He never had it until last week and now he loves it. - No, thank you. - Just try a little bit... Oh, that's okay. I have plenty right here. Tuna is demanding to be inside of you. - I actually don't want it. - It's not me, it's just the... Stop. Stop! I don't want it. What do you want me to do? Lick my nipples. - Will you? Come on, please? - Uh... Why didn't he just tell me he was gay? Maybe he isn't. Okay, or he's like into guys or whatever. Like, I'm cool with it, you know? Well, not every straight cis white boy is. I'm not a straight cis white boy! Like, I'm... I'm Brendan. - Oh, okay. - I am! I'm a nice guy, and I'm funny, and... in high school, everyone liked me. And now I'm just like the bad guy, I don't know how that happens. Well, welcome to feeling uncomfortable. Fuck you! - I've been uncomfortable. I know. This is unusual for you. But some of us feel that way all the time. It's not that great, right? No, it sucks. Yeah. Can I walk you home? Yes. Oh, yeah. I love it when you tell me things to do. - Mm. - Tell me to suck your fingers. - Suck my fingers. - Okay. Tell me you love it. Okay... Tell me the things to do. I have been telling you what to do. No, no, I know, but tell me different things. Like, tell me... tell me to put my dick in your mouth. Yeah, why don't we just do it the regular way. Are you coming right now? Are you coming right now? Okay, can... can you hold it? Can you try to hold it? Oh! Please, hold it. Try not to... Can... Okay. Okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Ooh. - I'm... I'm out. I fell out. Thank you for walking me home. - I'm a gentleman. - Uh-huh. So... wanna come up? Mm, no thanks. But I still wanna kiss you. Yes, yeah, definitely. - Good night. - Good night. Oh... I really like you. What are we doing? I don't know. I have to cram for two giant tests, but... you can join me if you like. So, this would be in your room. There are moments in your life when you made a conscious choice, knowing that that decision... would permanently change the shape of your life.
