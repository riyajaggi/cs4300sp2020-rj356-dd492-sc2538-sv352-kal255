 Fuck! That's fucking in... Okay. I'm sorry. I... I... I, you know, you just scared me. I thought it was something bad. It's not good, George. I mean, you have to understand, the craft ladies were beading bracelets... ... while your father was watching porn at full blast. So, what's the big deal? Everybody watches porn. Uh... Not in public.

 You a doctor? Are you even a nurse? No, I am not... even a nurse. I know this might be hard for you to hear, but I think now might be a good time for you to start looking for other arrangements - for your father's care. - I can't afford... other arrangements for my father's care. Okay? Can you just cut him a break? He's an old man, my mother's dead. Okay? He can only eat soup. He has no pleasures in life. You have any idea what that's like? Maybe making dreamcatchers isn't enough to get a guy through his whole fucking day. I'm not trying to take away his pleasure, George, he just can't watch porn in front of the craft ladies! I'll make sure to tell him that. Nice chat. Okay, so, this is your... Nighttime clothes will be in this, okay? Hey, don't do the new iPhone update, 'cause it just totally fucks up older phones. Okay, good to know. So... Uh... Uh... I say now we gotta tackle your desk. Which I have been yelled at for touching before. So, I'm gonna need some guidance here. - Uh... Earth to Brendan. - Yeah, what? I don't know what you want me to do with all this crap. - Um... - Okay, so, like this. Take it or leave it? - Take. - Take. Okay. Are you sure? Does this thing need to be driven in a car from one place to another? Right, I guess it might not fit in the van. I don't wanna micro-manage your stuff. I know... If you love it, you love it. I just... feel like... That was pretty easy. Done. Wow. Well, thank you for all your help. I couldn't have done it without you. - I'm just tired of this. - Oh, I'm sorry. Are you tired of lying down? Do you need to go lie down? Whoa. This is like my last night at home, Mom. - Do you really wanna do this? - Do you? - I'm sorry. - That's okay. - Are you hungry? - Mm-hm. I think I'm hungry. Mm. - Oh, I should've cut your hair. - Oh, my God. All you wanted was pasta. The only thing that you would put in your mouth was pasta with red sauce. Oh, please, find some protein. - Protein bars, and pasta. - No! Yeah. Well... ... try not to fill up, 'cause maybe somebody... went out and got you... ... some celebratory cupcakes! Uh... I... can't right now though, 'cause I gotta meet Troy and Wade. That's cool, right? Uh... - Yeah, but... - Last night, so I just figured - I should see them. - No, yeah, yeah, yeah. You should hang out with your friends. I actually gotta go. Um... Thanks for dinner... - for packing my stuff. - Yeah. Okay. Well, have fun. Not too late though, Brendan, okay? - It's a really big day tomorrow. - Yeah. - Yeah, I know. - Okay. - Love you. - All right. Look at you, big motherfucker! Yo. Hi! Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi. Yes! Hi. Bro, you are so feelin' it right now. - You can see it in his eyes. - I'm not! It's obvious! - True. - Yeah, it's true. Oh! Okay, okay. Hey. Hey. Uh... Just... wanted to check in. Our little guy's going to college! - Mm-hm. - How are we holding up? Um... Well, "we" are working hard. Well, I just wanna say, I... you've done such an amazing job with him. He's a... He's a great kid, and you deserve all the credit for that. Oh, thanks, Ted. That's very nice. How's the packing going? You know, I'm trying to shove our kid's life into the back of my car... by myself. Uh-huh. That's cool. What's up, Ted? Uh... So, yeah, regarding tomorrow. Jonathan's doctor rescheduled his appointment... so I won't be able to, uh... make it over there to help load the van, unfortunately. Are you kidding me? You're not even gonna come over to say goodbye? It just... It's out of my hands. This guy is the autism diet guy. It's a... a thousand-year wait just for a consult. Does Brendan know? I'll text him later. Are y... - Are you sure you're not mad? - Bye, Ted. Fuckin' fuck! - Get in here. - Thank you. God. I am so used to being rejected by him, but it's like, come on, tonight? This... It's our last night. Kids are so cruel. On Greta's last night she slept at a friend's house. And I just went in my closet and I saw that she took my favorite jacket. - The one with the... - Yes! - What a little... - Bitch! Yes! - Do you have any snacks? - No. After we dropped her, I just got rid of everything good. Oh, that's smart. I'm gonna do that. You know what? I have to say, I'm looking forward to this. Like, we're free from our kids. We finally get to do what we wanna do. I can't do exactly what I want. But I did sign up for a class. Oh, God, are you making pottery? It's called "The Personal Essay" - at Eastern Community. - Oh, boy. Okay, why are you reacting like I told you that I just found a lump? Because I'm not understanding why the second Brendan's out of the house you wanna do homework. Thought it sounded exciting to me. I was... I opened the catalog and I... I don't know... It... It grabbed me. Okay. I was gonna do this tomorrow, but I feel like, whatever, it's happening now. Now is the time. Very little something. Jane... Oh, this is lovely. Yeah, I know. That was 41 dollars. - Oh! Very generous price point! - Well, I love you. Aw! Oh. "Breathe." All right. Okay. But I think maybe you should listen to the candle. Mm. I breathe. I know, but go home, take a long bath, turn your brain off, and just think about opening up to new things. - Okay, like... like what? - Like fun. Like a handsome contractor. Mm-hm. Do you know one? - No. - Mm-hm. I didn't think so. Come here. Come here. Come here. Look... I just want you to meet some new people. You are a skinny MILF goddess. Oh, God, I hate that expression. I know, but it's true. - Lean in. - Oh, I hate that one more. We're gonna be okay.
