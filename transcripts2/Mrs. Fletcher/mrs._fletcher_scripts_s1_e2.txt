Claire used to practice the cello every night for an hour. And now it's just... dead silence. Just pure, dead silence. It's awful. Eve? Are you dating anyone? Um... No. It's okay.

What I'm trying to ask you is what do you want to get out of your undergraduate experience? Uh... A job. Fine. A job. What kind of job? Like, a good one. Like, something that pays, like, you know, like, six figures or something. Any particular area for this six-figure job? Uh... Well, you're my advisor. So, aren't you supposed to be... advising me? That's actually what's happening right now. Um... Sorry, it's, uh, it's... It's my mom. Yeah, of course, it is. I'm sorry. Look... I have a job to do here. So, let's find out a little more about you, say. How about extracurriculars? Well, I'm hoping to go Greek. But I have to wait til next year 'cause they don't allow freshman to rush. Well, I wouldn't know anything about that. Where I did my undergrad work, um, we didn't have frats. Vassar. - That must have sucked. - It didn't suck. - Hm. - Brendan, do you realize that in college every single minute of your existence is... entirely up to you. You have vast swaths of time that you have to fill under your own steam. Mommy isn't gonna be around to tell you what to do. Okay. So... - Mm... We done? - Do you wanna be done? Yeah, I wanna be done. - Yes, we're done. - Great. Good luck to you, Brendan. Yes, thank you. - Door closed, please. - Mm. Good luck to you too, dipshit. Uh-oh. Did we get a dud? Uh...

Wanna try an organic Popsicle? - Uh... Okay. - Yes. Maybe not that one. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. You like that? Yeah. Say you like it. Did you like it? Uh... It's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Eve? This is so weird. I haven't seen you in forever, and now twice in one week. Uh... Yeah, this is so... This is so weird. Emily, hi. Just don't buy any cereal though, right? Right. Right. You know that guy that... that you mentioned. - Pe... Uh... Peter? - Mm-hm. I could... You could totally give him my number. Or I... You... I could... You know, you could give me his. - Or whatever. - Oh, my G... Yes. Oh, I'm so excited. You guys are gonna love each other. Looking at who we really are or what we really want can be terrifying. It should be. But that terror is what tells us that we've stumbled onto something real. Something worth writing about. So, I'm gonna go around the room, and let's talk about what scares us. Whatever comes to mind. Curtis... Uh... Off the top of my head I'd say... black holes. They freak me out. The idea of being sucked into nothingness. Well, now, that scares me too. - Julian. - Um... I'm scared of my anti-depressants not working anymore. I'm on anti-depressants. I guess I'm telling everybody that. Thank you, Julian. Barry? Don't love a nuclear Iran. Okay. Eve... what scares you? You know that f... feeling where you... are convinced that you left the oven on, even though you know you haven't? Um... Been having that feeling a lot since my son went to college. And I know it's not about the oven. Then what is it about? I don't know. That's what scares me. Hello. Uh... Hi. Uh... Yes. Is this Eve? Mm-hm. Uh... This is Peter. Uh... I got your number from Emily. Oh, hi. Uh... I hope you don't mind that I called. Um... I'm not big on texting, and... No, no, I'm gla... No. No, me neither. No, I'm just... I'm so glad you called. - Hi. - Well it's... - nice to hear your voice. - Yes! Hi. Um... Well, uh, so Emily tells me that you're, um, in real estate. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I've been at Olive Branch Realty for the last 12 years, if you've ever heard of it. I... I think I have. Wait, Olive... - Olive... - Olive Branch... - Uh... Olive Branch? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's the place, uh... That's downtown, right? - Exactly. - Oh, yeah. - Got a good reputation. - It does. So, you have a son in college? I do. He just started. Uh... He's the best. We're really, really close. Aw, nice. I have a daughter, she just finished up in May. Oh, where'd she go? Brown. Where's your boy? Uh... Broder State. He's a... a pre-med. Wow, I'm jealous. I love my daughter, but I'm pretty sure I just spent half my life savings on her poetry degree. Oh... So, what do you think? You, uh... wanna meet up and do this in person? Yeah, I'd... Yeah. I'd love to. Great. Fantastic. ♪ It's new world now don't discriminate ♪ Look at the hula hoop girl. Yo, what is Latinx? Uh... It's "Latin-X."

The question is, does Sam have the right to expect sex? No. No. - No. - No, dude. No. Hey, girl. - What you doing? - I'm studying.

We're gonna have a last fling before we settle down and become good old American parents. But, Roger, you just didn't give up your job on the paper for no reason at all? Oh, darling, this trip's an inspiration. Do you remember the honeymoon I promised you? Well, we're gonna have it. But things are different now. - We've got to think about the baby. - Well, that's just it. As soon as the baby comes we won't be able to go anywhere. Besides, I want our baby born in the USA. Maybe we can get to work and start that little paper. Oh, but a trip like this costs a fortune. - Did you get more than the 20,000? - Oh, shit. Well, no. As a matter of fact, we didn't get the 20,000. We sold the property for cash and got 13,500. Well, can you take a trip and buy a paper... - ...and all that on 13,500? - Roy... Don't forget there's still lawyers' fees, deductions, stuff like that. Just how much did you get, Roger? I'm trying to tell you... - Roy... - After the deductions, we got 10,000. 10,000? George.
