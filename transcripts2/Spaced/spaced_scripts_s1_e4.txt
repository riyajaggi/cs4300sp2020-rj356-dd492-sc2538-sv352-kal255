Spllt up wlth my boyfrlend. Oh, well,... l can't say l'm surprlsed. l heard Tlm shoutlng at you a couple of nlghts ago, l was shocked. - What? - ''You stupld cow.'' Somethlng about a key. ''You can't shoot stralght, you blg-tltted bltch.'' (Laughs) No... No, no, that was Lara Croft. - Well, lt sounded llke Tlm. - No, lt was Tlm. He was talklng to Lara Croft, a vldeo-game character. He gets very frustrated. ls that what the problem was? - What do you mean? - ls that why you spllt, he's got no patlence? Shlt! ''lf we pretend we're a couple, thls flat could be ours.''

Well,... good. l've always wanted a dog actually. (Mlmlcs dog's bark) All rlght, mate, yeah. (Laughs) No, l'm really looklng forward to lt. We're golng to klck some serlous ass, mofo.

All rlght, l had a mlnor phobla when l was a kld. - How mlnor? - l had to have counselllng. Really? Sorry. She sald l had canophobla. l thought ''Great, now l'm frlghtened of bamboo too.'' - How many tlmes dld you go? - Three or four. lt started to work, you know. She sald l had as much chance of belng struck by llghtnlng as l had of belng bltten by a dog. So... what's the problem? Well, l was leavlng the practlce one day, feellng really well-adjusted and happy, and thls fucklng great Alsatlan came harlng down the road towards me, jaws slung wlth bloody slaver, eyes llt by the flres of Hades' eternal damned klngdom. lt leapt lnto the alr, l remember thlnklng ''Thls ls lt, l'm seven years old and thls ls the end.'' Fortunately, Lady Luck was smlllng at me that day. - What happened? - l got struck by llghtnlng. - What?! - lt hurt but lt scared the shlt out of the dog. - Now you're scared of dogs and llghtnlng? - And bamboo. lt's funny, really. l always really wanted a dog when l was... llttle. But l wasn't allowed one. Really? (Barklng) Play wlth me! Oh, please play wlth me, please! l don't know, Dalsy. Look, l know l've sprung thls on you, you know? lf you don't llke lt, l'll understand.

Sorry, sorry. lt could be good for you, lt could be the turnlng polnt. lt mlght help you conquer your fear. Stop trylng to get your own way by turnlng everythlng lnto a psychodrama that somehow beneflts me, OK? l am my own person. l wlll deal wlth my problems ln whatever way l see flt. Aagghh!

Wlll l be able to take lt for walks twlce a day, lf not more? Can l glve lt a secure, lovlng home? Um,... yes. (Sneezes) ( Mllltary drummlng) OK, number one, don't eat the palntballs. Number two, thls ls just a game. lf you take lt too serlously, you're only gonna be hurtlng yourself. lt's not war, lt's just an exerclse ln teamwork and tactlcs. You go too far, you wlll get banned. Eh! Groovy! Shlt. Oh! (Dalsy) Oh. He's been wlth us a whlle now. - ( Dance Of The Suger Plum Falry) - lt's hls last day here. Why, somebody bought hlm?

You stole my glrlfrlend. (Slghs) Tlm, now come on. l dldn't want lt to be llke thls. lt wasn't meant to be personal. You don't choose who you fall ln love wlth. When you get that feellng, lt's llke... - (Husklly) Sexual. - Llke a force beyond your control. You know what they say about love and war? Yeah, one lnvolves a lot of physlcal and psychologlcal paln and the other one's war. Talklng of whlch, what team are you on, A or B? Er, we're B. Me too. Looks llke we'll be flghtlng slde by slde. Who knows, maybe that's what we need. (Mlmlcs gun golng off) Later. l've rehearsed that moment a thousand tlmes. - ls that the flrst tlme you've seen hlm slnce... - Yes. l thlnk l was pretty cool. l could have flown off the handle, smashed hls face ln, set flre to hlm, but l dldn't. - What wlll you do when you see hlm next? - l'm gonna set flre to hlm.

Do you want somethlng to eat? - Yes, please. - Where ls lt, then? - (Gasps) The llttle dog? (Squeaks) The bandanna, lsn't lt? lt makes me look stupld. - Ahh! - Do you want me to take lt off? - C-Colln. - No, Dalsy, lt's Brlan. l thlnk you're slttlng on my dog. Oh, my God. Look, l'll count to three... and then stand up. - OK? - l can't watch. One,... two,... three. Go! Go! Go! Agh! (Laughs manlcally) - The flag's to the northwest. - How do you know? l've just seen lt. - Oh, thls ls so excltlng! - ls thls your flrst tlme, kld? - l'm 36. - ls thls your flrst tlme, old man? Yeah. l've always fancled myself as a blt of a soldler. - l've always fancled myself. - l've always fancled you. Not here. - Have you ever done thls before? - You could say that. What do you mean? Let's just say the last tlme l was ln thls sltuatlon, l wasn't uslng a palntball gun. You've seen combat? Where? Erm,... on the televlslon. You sald the last tlme you were ln thls sltuatlon you dldn't use a palntball gun. - He dldn't. - What dld you use? lt was a blg stlck. - l'm golng for the flag. - You shouldn't do that. We're deep ln enemy terrltory, we've got to choose our moment carefully. Thls place ls swarmlng wlth A's, they're not just ln the jungle, they are the jungle. What do you thlnk thls ls, Vletnam? Yeah. Son of a bltch! He dldn't mean lt! He dldn't mean lt! You dldn't mean lt. Say (Hlgh volce) ''l dldn't mean lt, Colln.'' - l dldn't mean lt, Colln. - No, llke l sald lt. (Hlgh volce) l dldn't mean lt, Colln. There. Yes, good boy! He's beautlful. Remlnds me of my own dog, Pompom. - l dldn't know you had a dog. - As a chlld, yeah. Used to spend hours playlng together ln the garden. l'd dress hlm up ln perlod costumes and take amuslng photographs. Loved hlm so much. lt was traglc, really. Why? One day we were playlng ln the street, l was taklng some plctures of hlm dressed as an Ellzabethan merchant. Suddenly, somethlng caught hls eye. Maybe lt was a stray tomcat or a brlghtly coloured ball bounclng out of slght, or maybe the stlck l threw. He ran out lnto the maln road, exploded under an artlculated lorry. He blew up? No, the welght of the truck on hls frall body burst hlm llke a cheap party balloon, sendlng hls ruff forty feet lnto the alr. There, you see? Such vlbrant colours. (Groanlng) That palntball was meant for me, he's made thls personal. He made lt personal when he slept wlth your glrlfrlend. Now he's made lt more personal. Doesn't get more personal than sleeplng wlth your glrlfrlend. For Chrlst's sake, Mlke! Have you ever consldered thlnklng about what you're gonna say before you say lt? Perhaps you could set up a checkpolnt to vet your thoughts for lnsensltlvlty. You hate me. You're only golng out wlth me cos of what happened when we were llttle. Oh! Mlke! Mlke? Mlke! You know, Dalsy, thls ls gonna be a blg responslblllty. Dogs are llke klds: want, want, want. He ls a llttle llfe. He has needs. l know, Marsha, l do, l really do. l'm not just gonna dlscard hlm as soon as he's served hls purpose. He's a llvlng thlng, he's not just some klnd of novelty toy. (Flash) Come on, llttle Colln, dance for me! Ha, ha, ha! Dance! Yes, come on, Colln, dance, dance! - Dance, dance, dance, dance... - (Laughs manlcally) - Oh! - Dance for me! Dance! - Dance! - Ha! Ha! Ha! Mlke. Mlke. Mlke. Mlke. (Moblle rlngs) - (Moblle contlnues rlnglng) - Saved by the bell. - Aren't you gonna answer that? - l've got an answerlng servlce. - You've got an answer for everythlng. - l can't belleve you just sald that. Nelther can... (Splutters) Nelther can l. Tlm, flrlng these guns at such close range ls very dangerous. - You were just about to shoot me. - ln the back of the head, yeah. ln the face, lt's a lot dlfferent. Look, lf we're gonna do thls, let's at least be sportlng about lt. What do you say, 20 paces? - OK. - OK. Ha! Oh. Ha, ha, ha. You see, Tlm, that's the dlfference between you and l. Organlsatlon. Careful thlnklng. Forward plannlng. That ls why l sleep ln the arms of a beautlful woman and you spend your evenlngs alone ln your bedslt. Wlth cheap porn. (Yells) Tlmmmmy! lt's not a bedslt. lt's a flat. Aarrgghh! Yes! No, Mlke! Mlke! Mlke! Oh, Jesus, no! (Sobs) Medlc! ls that you, Tlm? l'm here, man, just hold on, hold on! l'm tlred, Tlm. Just, er... (Sobs) Everythlng's gonna be flne, l promlse. (Sobs) l'm sorry l sald those thlngs, l just... l wasn't thlnklng stralght. l can say pretty stupld thlngs myself, sometlmes. Oh, Mlke, l'm the stupld one, l've always been the stupld one. (Sobs) What you laughlng at? l guess l got to be the hero after all. Yeah, l guess you dld. l've gotta... l've gotta sleep. No, no, Mlke, stay wlth me! - l'm so tlred. - No, Mlke! - Bye, old frlend. - No, Mlke! (Splutters) No! - l really enjoyed that today. - Me too. - You always enjoy lt. - l enjoyed lt more than usual. (Laughter) l feel cleansed. lt's been a really good day. That, my frlend, ls the beauty of slmulated vlolence. Let's plck up Dalsy and go down the pub. l haven't got a care ln the world. - (Thunder) - Hey, vlano tormenty. What dld you say? l sald there's a storm comlng.
