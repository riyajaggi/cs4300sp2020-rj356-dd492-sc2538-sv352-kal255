 In the year 2037 our world is dying. Mankind has been struck by an infertility pandemic. Those who suffer childbirth are rewarded with a mere 15 seconds of their baby's life. Before the virus takes them. Anyone that does this once, never attempts it again. The pain is just too much. Sync and corrected by pepelepew Today, Biocorp made made world history by administering the cure for cancer.

 Available to the entire world's population, in exchange for their voluntary enrollment in the ID chip program. Not a single child exists in our world today. Empty schools and empty playgrounds haunt our waking dreams. People rioted. Killed each other in the hopeless void that faced us. Biocorp was allowed to declare martial law to keep the peace. Which only meant they employed hired thugs to put down anyone that blamed them for their futile existence. An uprising killed 15 million people in 2023. There hasn't been a rebellion since.

 And what would be the point? Biocorp doesn't have to care. No one does. But it was our fault, really. Biocorp tempted every human into accepting the ID chip program. A microchip that would cure every disease known to man. The promise was immortality. It almost lived up to its promise. We're healthy. There's no disease in our time. But there's also no children. As the chip couldn't tell the difference between disease and a pregnancy. It was tough to put a brave face on it. But we had to. For those we loved. Hey, sis. Hey, baby. Hey, baby. I found a new place today. Oh yeah, how was it? Oh, it was great. That's good. Surprises. - Surprises? - Mmm hmm. Okay. Yup, I did. Look at this. What is that? What are you trying to sweeten me up for? No, it's not, I love that smile. There's no food is there? No, but there's copper wire. - Oh, copper wire. - Mm hmm. I'm sure that will taste very delicious. Indeed it will, once you put that secret sauce of yours. Oh, a secret sauce of mine. Hey babe, the secret? It's out. We are on the verge of finding you. Believe me our species will prevail. You need not worry about that. We've heard this before! Biocorp needs to give us a solution now! You made the problem you should clean it up! Sir, we have the best scientists on this planet. And we are aware of everything you are saying, sir. As I was saying. Biocorp is protecting your future. Are you trying to get us both killed? They are lying to us every month! They're hiding something in there! Of course they are! Okay. Vanish. Do you know, it's people like you. Scientists. That ruin our world. Meddling into things you couldn't possibly ever understand. I understand. No you don't. Our species is dying, that much you might understand. What you don't understand is that our only hope, lies with the Biocorp scientists finding a cure for this pandemic. And in order for them to do that, we need to give them everything they need. Including cooperation. Cooperation so they can do their job as quickly as possible. Is that a joke? Biocorp. Do you believe half of the rubbish you spout from that podium every month? Biocorp isn't doing anything. Biocorp doesn't have a cure. That's the truth. Biocorp isn't even working on a cure. That's the truth! You know why? Because if they were, you'd be flanked by scientists. And not guys with guns. Wanna cause a panic? Hmm? Want the riots again of 2023, is that what you'd like? I want the truth. Oh, you want the truth. Well, I'm gonna tell you the truth. And after I tell you the truth, that man is going to kill you. So here's the truth. We've got nothing. If you'll excuse me, I have to meet with our CEO. Make it discreet. Perhaps I've got time for a cigarette. What do you say? Thank you. I know it's not easy. Just following orders, huh? You old enough to remember a time when everyone was worried about these things killin' us? And Biocorp broke in and saved the world by curing cancer. Something kinda funny about that. Cure every disease. Including that horrible one pregnancy. I haven't got a lighter. Alright, ready? Ready to fly? Is everything okay? - Hey. - Hi. I was skipping curfew. Yeah, well maybe you need a new watch. Because you've got 30 minutes. Right, yeah. Well maybe I was rushing home to see you. Sister. Brother's in the room, you know. Maybe you should tell me your brother's still here. Any joy? Uh, if by any joy you mean putting him into a coma, yes. By teleporting him 10 feet now. We gotta stop killing mice. I don't feel good about it. Yeah, me too. Okay. Tell me about the signal, c'mon. Well, it's the same 23 hour 56 minute repetition. Okay. But there's no way to track where it's coming from. What about the triangulation by the numbers, I thought it was something. That's just it. There is a source reading. If you look right here, What did it say? Well, it says it's coming from here. Here the apartment? Thing has a bug in it. We have to recalibrate it again. Yeah. Guys, come on it's getting cold. We'll get there with it, mate. What did you say? We'll get there with it, mate. Okay, dude, we'll get there with it mate. Don't take the mick outta me. Damn, mate, just the love tags. Hey, easy man. It's my turn, it's my turn. My turn! See what I grew up with? Shut up, okay. Pretend like I never heard anything you guys said before, and tell me again, how exactly is this gonna make us rich? Hey, what he's trying to say is, that teleportation is possible, and we actually have the prototype to show to the government. A prototype? - Yes we have the prototype. - You call that a prototype? - Okay. - Yes. We'll just stay with the governor's committee, and we need more funding so we can get to the next level. Ah, that doesn't work. - Excuse me, it works. - It does? - Yes. - It was sort of... No, phase one of it was. - Oh, how many phases - There's like, two or three phases. But phase one? Human mapping. Encoding. We can do all of that, we just can't send it anywhere cuz it's too big Ohhh so you can't really teleport anyone. It's a little bit... - Sounds like a little flaw. - It's not a flaw. - Just a little bit. - Actually no, no. The mapping process is really impressive. And the recoding thing that we figured out is really cool Oh the recoding. Oh there he goes abusing the word cool! Don't abuse the word cool. Once we get the, you know what once we get the copper wire around the coils, all we're going to have to look at is signal degradation. Signal degradation, that's another magical. No, that's something else. Shut up, sis. The signal, mate, you wanna hear about that? I definitely wanna hear about that. Go ahead tell me. If you're not worthy of this story, just say, okay? Tell it. Go ahead, sis. Every day for the last year, every 23 hours, 56 minutes, we get a signal that lasts six seconds. What does it say? Well, it's more like a beacon. - Oh, a beacon. - No, but... - I was thinking, - So who's sending it? - Where is it coming from? - - We're beaconing you. Yes, but it's on the top of our list, we're figuring it out. Oh, I have a few things for the top of the list. Okay, okay, you know what? You know what? Why don't you guys just let us know sometime. You know if you guys wanna chip in... Hey. Hey. You on lookout duty? No, just came up for a breath of fresh air. Ah. You okay? You seem a little off. I haven't come up to the roof everyday to think about things. What were you thinking about? I was thinking, it is going to rain. You know that's really a British stereotype, talking about the weather? Okay, am I living up to that right now? You are living up to it. - Right. - Uh huh. Well, I don't know if you'd be really interested in what I was really thinking about anyway. Yeah the fact that you were thinking is what's impressive. But go on. Okay, well you'll like this one slightly better then. Okay, okay. I was thinking about you. You were thinking about me? That's nice. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey, you okay? I don't want you to, uh, pin all your hopes on me. Not me. And you know what I am for you? I'm a lack of options. I'm a distinct lack of options. Why don't you stop talking, okay? Look, I don't know what's going on with you, but, don't try and push me away with this crap and not tell me what's really going on, okay? So what's going on? We can't, we can't. You can't. I feel like something's coming. And I might not always able to be here. Okay. Where would we go? Where would we go, there's nowhere to go. There's nothing beyond the city walls. Not anymore. Here is all we got. Is here that bad? No here's, pretty wonderful sometimes. But you know here is also owned by Biocorp. Biocorp, who can turn up whenever they want, take whatever they want simply because it pleases them. And that's a precarious place to be. We're safe here. Together. Yeah. Did you feel that? That was a raindrop. - Why are you changing - That's a raindrop! - The subject? - I'm not changing - I get with the rain. - I'm standing up here to - You are gonna, - That's a raindrop. I'm gonna kill you one of these days. It is gonna fully rain. I've got powers or something. I can't even have a serious conversation with you, I swear! You're gonna kill me one of these days. Oh boy. Our efforts to find a cure for a disease that has plagued our generation, will take longer than we first predicted. We've all suffered greatly. And without ever being able to bring to justice whatever disease put us in this position. The global biological clock Is ticking against us. At this time, during our darkest hour During our darkest hour, as we go through hell, As we go through hell, the only thing we can do, The only thing we can do, is keep going. Is keep going. That's pretty good. We can go ahead and release that. It is, with a heavy heart, that I address you today. Our efforts to find a cure for a disease that has plagued our generation, will take longer than we first predicted. Block 14, report to Sector Nine. Can't sleep? Uh, no. I was just gonna, um... You? Bad dream. The one with the kid, right? Yeah, nightmares of the mind are the craziest thing. Make you believe things about people that um, you never thought they'd ever do. Yeah. Hmm. What's up buddy? You know I should, uh, I think it'd be best if I... Look, I uh, I killed a Biocorp guard today. What? Had no choice, really. It was like a self defense, the speaker, he was lying in the forum, right? So I called him out on it, but I, I didn't know what else to do. Where's the body? The body, where's the body? I had to leave him, uh, It's in an alleyway. No you're not, they're gonna find it. No, it's under debris. It's like on a Oh my God. Nick, what was I supposed to do? What was I supposed to rollover and die? What were you supposed to do? Thomas what you're supposed to do is not come here, after you kill a Biocorp guard! You know you put my sister and my wife in harms way? I didn't... They're gonna find you, you gotta chip. An ID chip. They won't track me, here we're in concrete. I'll be, it'll be muffled. That's why I went here. Oh so you're so sure about that, huh? - I'm not sure - You're not sure about much. Sure hey, but, look it happened so fast. I was gonna, hey what are you doing what are you doing? - Whoa whoa whoa whoa! - I'm going to clean up your mess. Where's the body? Please, let me go. I was gonna go, let me go. Where is the body? If I go, the problem goes with me. Please. I can't let you go, you can't go back to the scene of the crime for Christ's sake, they'll see you comin' it's curfew! Yes but if we don't find the body, they're gonna find you in less than 24 hours with your chip. Thomas, where's the body? Thomas! What, what, no wait, what did you say? I said where's the body. No no did you say, you said they'd find me in Less than 24 hours - So what. - A day, a day, right? 24 hours a day. Yeah, so what? What's less than 24 hours? What are you talking about? 23 hours, 56 minutes. Yeah. 23 hours 56 minutes. That signal, that comes in every 23 hours 56 minutes. - Right, so what? - You know what else it is? The exact length of a rotation of the Earth. A day. We just round it up to, to 24 hours for convenience. Right? Right, I know that. But what difference does it make when there's a body out there that needs to be dealt with? Otherwise they're gonna ship us to the outer lands! Stop thinking about distance. Stop thinking about where we are. It's about when. The signal. When is the signal? Not where is it coming from, when is it coming from? - When? - It's a day. Someone wants us to When? pay attention to time. When? Think about it. The teleportation system, we start working on that a year ago. Then we start gettin' this signal. At the exact same time. Right? We're so obsessed with trying to change one variable we can't seem to control. Distance. But we're forgetting about the other variable. What if we hold distance firm and we change the only other variable we can? The other variable being time. Time. But how do we... How do we? How'd you did? The signal, the beacon it's our beacon. It's from right here, right in this room! It's just not from right now. Alright, look. The frequency of the signal shifts by a decibel and then it just resets. Okay, but it shifts and resets. So look for a pattern. I got it. It's repeating binary code. Let's see it. Let's see it! What do you got, what do you got? Uh, it's a sequence of numbers. Uh, 1-2-2-0-2-0-1-7. What does it mean, what does it mean? Um, I, location coordinates for something. No no no that's not enough for longitude latitude. Uh, it's, ah... Thomas! We're idiots! Look it's not, look! It's time. It's a date. December 20th, 2017. My god, that's before Biocorp. Exactly! Before the virus became a pandemic. I know. We can go back. We're almost there. We can go back and fix all this before it ever happened. Go back? We can't send Henry 10 feet without inducing a coma. Maybe we didn't. Check this out, buddy. Look, come here. Alright, look. As long as Henry was in stasis, his brain activity was consistent to rodent that was awake. It was all because he was awake. He was alive somewhere moving around! Niko, that's a big assumption. We don't know if that's true and even if it is, it's a one way trip! We never brought anybody back! But if this is right, we're talking about time travel. I mean we could fix all this before it ever happened. Jesus, Thomas. We're talking about the extinction of Mankind! Don't pretend we have to think about this. Okay, okay you're right. You're right, okay? So who gets to go? Look, I'll go because if something happens to me I need you to take care of the girls. Great, you're going to leave me explaining this crap? - Yeah. - Oh. I'll go, because I'm the guy who killed somebody. I'm the wanted man. No because this was my idea. You don't need this sore. You know the guy I am. I'm always trying to take responsibility. You don't need to suffer! So let me handle the consequences. Isn't that what you want me to do? We're gonna flip for it. - We're not gonna flip for it. - Yes we are. We're gonna flip for it. No, I'm gonna go. No, this is gonna happen. Otherwise I'm kicking your ass. Fine, flip. Heads. Best of three. Shut up and help me get this going. His name is Thomas. He's an enemy of the state. He murdered a Biocorp employee. This is your new target. We need swift justice. Set an example. To everybody in Sector Nine. In a state of emergency, disobedience will not be tolerated. Dismissed. Okay, okay. So, uh, this is it. Oh yeah, yeah, yes yes. Okay you know and if anything happens, you just, you know. I know, I know, I know, I know. You want me to marry your sister, right? No, no. I'll be back to make sure that doesn't happen. Ah. Assuming this works, how am I gonna know it works? I'm gonna use this beacon to send us a little blip. That answers that question. Now, what would you like me to say to your wife? Tell her, Tell her I love her. I'm doing this for the child that we never got to have. That sounds, terrible. I'm going to make up something much better later on ok? Much more classy. Then I'll deliver it in my British accent, and she'll love it, your sister will love it, it's comforting. I get it. - You know what I'm saying. - Mm hmm. So this is gonna work? What are you gonna do when you get there? Tell the people what's coming. That's a little vague, you'll look like a madman. Tell President Williams. And how you gonna find President Williams? I don't know. What university did President Williams attend in 2017? President Jack Williams lectured at Chesterfield University between 2013 and 2018. Think ahead, buddy. I've always got my answers. Get in the coffin. I can tell you this stings by the way. Hey mate? Good luck. You're the one that has to tell the girls. Very true. Okay. Adam, start the bio scan. Bio scan initiated. Alright, mate. This'll put you to sleep. Adam is the system ready? Bio scan complete, Thomas. System ready. Alright. Here we go. Adam, hit it! Time displacement program initiated. What the hell is going on? Jesus, you scared the heck out of me. Thomas, what the hell is going on? He didn't tell you about this? Don't talk, talk to me. Okay, whoa whoa, release, okay. We found something. It's Biocorp. Oh God. I have to go. What? - I have to go. - What? What the hell are you talking about? I have to lead them away from us. What am I supposed to do? You don't need to do anything, okay the machine will run itself. Okay, let me, if you need to wake him, you use the adrenaline. Adrenaline, what? I thought you couldn't wake anyone in stasis. - Ah. - Better not be true. Why do I have a funny feeling I might be safer outside? Because you might. Look, just wake him up and we can go. wherever the hell you wanna go. Look, I can't, okay? What do you mean? Because I don't know how. What? Niko got in that machine as a leap of faith. Okay, he's doing it to save us. All of us. They say you killed a trooper. - Yeah, okay. - What? They're here! - How many? - Whole platoon! They've surrounded the building. What's happening? Yeah, what is happening? Okay, let me explain the most important thing right now for us all is to keep them out of this building. Okay, okay how do we do that? I don't know. - Do we have any weapons? - No. Ooh, oh what abut the failsafe? No, is it even armed? - I can arm it! - No no no no no! You'll kill the power. Okay, okay. We need to stop them. If you kill the power, you kill Niko. What do we know about this place? Five floors, 25 citizens, all legal. Armed? We have to presume so, sir. Show me. Best breach points are here, and here, north and south walls. Can I leave this with you? Sure. Thank you sir. Make it clean, Edier. Yes, sir. Everyone listen! We've got a cure for the pandemic, but Biocorp are here trying to steal it! Protect this building and I'll give you the cure! That's how he wants to play. You heard the man! Look around and find yourself something to use for a weapon! Take your assault positions. Sir! Well, that brings up the eternal debate. Would you kill Adolf Hitler? Would you go back in time, and end his life as a baby? Okay, one at a time, one at a time. Jeremy. Of course I'd kill him as a baby. I'd even murder his parents, so they couldn't create another monster. Well, who agrees with that answer? Michelle? Uh, um... I wouldn't want to change past. If not Hitler, it would have been someone else. It could have been someone worse. Okay. See, most of the world's problems can be avoided, if we lost the human desire to meddle. We're meddlesome. And we shouldn't be. Okay, that's it. Guys read chapter seven and eight, might be a quiz next Friday. Have a good night. Jack? Yes? Hey. I'm a friend of your fathers. Um, I was thinking about throwing a party for him. Seeing if you can, give me a hand. You know, talk to my brother about that stuff. He's better and he's always wanting to make daddy happy. No no no, see, uh, I need you. You're, you're the guy I need. Okay well I, uh, teach class in 30 minutes. So time's not really on our side. Very true. Find substation access panel one three H. Cut the feed. Let's make 'em sweat in there. Yes sir. The power is in your hands. So, let me get this straight. Firstly, you don't know my dad. Secondly, I'm going to become the President of the United States, and thirdly, be responsible for the demise of the planet. So you traveled back in time, to warn me. Yes, look. Jack. You have the power to save the entire human race. Jack. There's no kids left in 2037. Are you high right now? No, Jack I'm not high. Look I know this sounds crazy Look it's been a pleasure speaking with you, but I have to prepare for mid terms. Please. No, I don't have time for this. Look, look. Listen to me. I will do whatever it takes, to save the entire world from your bad decisions. You know what this isn't right. And you need help. Okay. Sit down, jack. He's connected to the box in stasis, but his brain activity is like he's awake. So it's looks like he's walkin' around. Power cell breach. Thomas. System inline initiating. Oh bullocks. Must hurry. What, what's happening? They're accessing the local power grid. We need to wake him up. What do you mean? What's going on? Biocorp outside are accessing the local power grid. That can only mean one thing. They're about to cut the power for the building before they storm in here. That'll cut the life support. Hence, we need to wake him up. Well, what about a backup generator? That would buy us time, hours only. It doesn't fix the problem. What we need to do is wake him up so we can move him. So I need a massive dose of adrenaline to do that. David, please get it for me! David, please! Okay. Is it safe? He can handle it. Do it. Have you ever done anything like this? Many times. On mice. And how are they doing? Alright here we go. Alright c'mon let's do this. What the hell is going, help! Hey somebody help! Turn it off now! Stop it! Stop it! It's out! Okay we need to flush out the adrenaline. He needs another IV line. - A new IV line. - Flush out the adrenaline. Right, okay, yeah. Right. I'm sorry. You're sorry? What the hell's going on? What happened? You must be an epileptic or something. Please, untie me and let me take you to the hospital! No, no, I just... There's no way to, we don't have time for that. How's he doing? Well, his pressure's decreasing. He'll be okay. He'll be okay? - Jenny. - He'll be okay. Okay mister genius, why don't you tell me, why didn't it work? Because we've never tried it before. What? Jenny, we don't have any ideas here, okay? Look, this is uncharted territory. We're figuring it out as we go. Alright, we're tired, we're under pressure, we need to Sleep. - Sleep, we need - No, no no no. Not us, we need hm to sleep. Now keep going. Brain activity. What does it look like on the monitor? It's like he's walking around in the past. Okay, but he couldn't make the trip unless he was unconscious. So, maybe, if he were unconscious in the past, He could make the trip home. Do it. Back up system engaged. Please find an alternative power source We don't have a lot of time to tell him. To avert system failure. You know what, here's a bright idea. You sent him, you bring him home. Must be something wrong with the system. We don't have time. What system, what are you talking about? About you destroying the world, that's what we're talking about. Look, unfortunately, I don't have time for this. Okay? You , you're gonna listen to everything I have to say. You and your father commission a company called Biocorp. In 2037. Before then. You're not epileptic, you're just crazy. Look, I didn't come all this way for nothing. All the way from the future? Yes! 2037! Okay, fine! Go, go ahead, amuse me! Amuse you, I'll amuse you. Where I'm from, the entire world is ending. Do you even know what that feels like? Can you even comprehend that? Can you? I've never seen activists work like you! Who is it you work for? Greenpeace? Or is this because my father is a Senator? Jack, listen! You're gonna be the President in the future. Listening. Yes the President. And you're going to ruin the entire future. Because you don't have the information. But, Jack, listen. I'm trying to give you the information. I'm trying to give you the information. You have to help me. You are crazy! Everything I'm telling you is the truth. You wanna know the truth? You have kidnapped, and you have threatened the life of a senators son! Jack. When my father gets a hold of you, you are gonna get the death penalty! Yes sir, yes. I'll notify him immediately. What's wrong? We need to initiate protection protocol, Senator. Your son's been reported missing. The rest of the family? Being secured as we speak. Please follow me. So you were gonna leave without saying goodbye? I'm coming home. I saw the bags at the door. You were gonna leave as soon as you got here. I was just trying to protect you. You understand that? I would never, ever hurt you. You have no idea how much I care about you. Okay? If I hurt you, it would be a nightmare. For me. You know, for a genius, you don't know how dumb you are. Well you can beat me up about how stupid I am when I get home. It's a deal. I'll come back. You sure you wanna do this? No, no not really. But, uh, he'd do it for me though. Thomas. You bring back my husband. I'll try. We're ready for you now. Keep it on as long as possible. 'Cause if we get cut off here, I have no idea what happens to us then. Let's do this. They're inside. We have to get time. Let's go. Adam, run the program. Where did you come from? Are you okay? I need to save us. I need to find out where Chester University campus is. It's two blocks that way. Thank you. Yeah. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. Listen to me. I'm going to have to kill you and your family if you don't listen to me. Like... What the hell? Thomas. We don't have time to convince. We can't take that risk. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's going to be okay. Yeah. Thomas are you crazy? I'm starting to do something definitive in this time. We had to! You can't go around killing people! Hey, hey! I'm here. It worked, it worked. It's a time machine. You guys made a time machine. Which by the way is way cooler than teleportation. - How are the girls? - Oh, they're freakin' out. Which is why I'm here. 'Cause, cause we gotta get you back now. No. We're not leaving 'cause nothing's changed. So how do we know? We'd have vanished, right? We'd have reset in some way. What if, what if we're protected in a temporal bubble? Yeah, yeah, yeah or maybe nothing's changed. The future is still there waitin' for us and we gotta go. No no, we are not going home until we know it worked. Otherwise we made the trip for nothing. Who's the President. President? The President. Who's the President? Williams. That can't be. Why? Because Thomas killed him. You killed John Williams? Yeah, and... Wait. Who's John Williams? Did you... Did you just kill Jack Williams? I did what I had to do. Okay? So who the hell is John Williams? He's the President. Who ran for office, to make the world a better, safer place 'cause they never caught the guy who killed his older brother Jack. You have a purpose. Make your brother proud. Yes, sir. Every day of your life, you look in the mirror and you see your brother in you! See your mission. Your purpose. Yes, sir. Go to your mother. So, we changed nuthin'. No, wait, we changed who was President. That was nothing. That's something. We changed the President. What did that achieve, Thomas? What did that achieve? I don't know. We still have a world that's infertile. You know, half the world is dying. Because the riots of 2023 still ravaged every hope of us finding a cure! You mean 2021. What? No it doesn't matter. No what did you say? It might matter. No, I get what he's saying. What does it matter. When was the riots? Wait, what do you mean, what, what year? 2021. We advanced the riots by two years. How many people died? 90 million. We've added 40 million to the death toll. What? When we left, the riots of 2023, 50 million people. We're making things worse. And quicker. We can fix it though. We can fix this. No, no. We can't do this. We can't do this. We can't. We can't. - We can fix this. - No more reaching. We were unable to trace them. What do you mean? Find who killed my son.
