 Previously on Dystopia. You mentioned a list? We need their addresses. There's eight of them that are pivotal to the Biocorp project that we're dealing with and they're a huge key to the launch of the virus. We are getting close. 30 attempts, 30 dead volunteers, that's what you call close. Yeah, but are you sure that's the right guy? It's definitely the right guy.

 All right, change the future, but you can not change the past. You're in our future. She has something in common. Infertility. And that pain and that anguish that you feel right now, multiply that by 6,000,000,000 people and you have what happens in our world, because of you. Have her strapped into the machine. Do you really think I hate you so much I'd kill the woman I love? I'd do anything for her. And now for tonight's top story. Today Nobel Peace Prize winning Biocorp made history

 by administering the cure for cancer, available to the entire world's population in exchange for their compulsory enrollment in the I.D. Chip Program, which allows for increased population security. Bio Corp CEO stated, we are at the precipice of change, which always feels unnerving, but what changes we make today will echo in time and our children will thank us for embracing the new world. That's all for tonight. And we're all clear. Hi babe. Was it a good news day? I don't know baby, we're gonna have to wait and see. When will we know? I guess we'll find out by the end of the day. Now I heard that my baby wants some chocolate ice cream. Yeah. Mrs. Adams. Yes. I'm David Johnson from Biocorp. It's time for your I.D. chip enrollment. That was fast. We believe that the media should be the first to jump on board, set a great example. Of course. Come on, baby. Track the microchip. Find Nico. What are you saying to her? I'm just trying to help her relax. She has to be in a coma like state before she goes through. Now remember, you only have an hour to put yourself to sleep before we pull you back in. Don't waste time exploring. Find Nico and come home. Watch everything he does, gentlemen. Jenny connected. Displacement initiated. Did it work? Her brain activity is comparable with somebody who's awake. What does that mean? It means it worked. She's in the past. What year? 2017. Excellent, bring her back. But we have to wait the full hour. Pull her back right now. If you pull her back now, she'll die. I find that of little concern. Bring her back now. Well then you won't know if the machine is working properly or not. You wanna know if it works? We gotta do it right. Don't toy with me, son. She has 55 minutes. Sync and corrected by pepelepew What are you typing? I'm taking notes on her brain activity, her heart rate, her temperature and her blood pressure just to make sure there's no significant changes. I trust all you gentlemen are paying attention here please? We're getting it all down, sir. So if this all works, I decided not to execute you. And instead have you work for Biocorp, but I will agree to release her, if it works. Well you can think about it, but it's easy really, live and work for Biocorp, or die. The deal we had... The deal's changed, keep up. What are you planning to do with it? You could destroy everything by meddling with the past. I didn't create it. Those were your meddlesome friends. You think they had lofty motives. I'm sure they're creating havoc already. No, they stumbled on it by accident. Oh yes, this is clearly all an accident. No, it's true. They didn't want any of this to happen. Well, be that as it may, I will use it to go back and change things for the better. Tampering with the past could threaten our very existence. Look, I will do everything you want, but she has to live. Why would you risk your life for her? Cause that's just what friends do for one another. Friends? The word friend has no true meaning here. We are creatures of want and need. Those you call friends merely satisfy you. I think you're confused. Just put the gun down and we can talk. Tell me about Biocorps. I told you, I don't know anything about that. You're lying. This is all your fault. You're probably one of her. You started the whole thing, didn't you? You tried it on your child, didn't you? No, you're crazy. You think you're better than us? I am crazy, but you're a genocidal stain. You're a genocidal stain! Listen to me, listen to me. If you even come close to making Bio Corp succeed or support them, I swear I will kill you. Do you understand? Say you understand! I understand. I understand. All right, enough time. Do it now. No, it's not time. Do it now. Look at her brain activity. I don't care. Do what I say. Her brain wave patterns say she's not asleep yet. If you wake her up now, it'll kill her. I think you two are up to something. You told me to run the machine properly. You knew that she has to be in stasis. And now I'm telling you to bring her back. What is the point of knowing how it works if you won't let me show you how it works? That's insane! Do it now. I will not kill her. You're not looking to kill. You're buying time. Step aside, you're finished. What do you want me to do with him? Kill him. I won't have people barking orders at me like I'm one of their pets. How will you figure the exact way to bring someone back? Try on her. Jenny? Oh my gosh. Oh, I can't believe it's you. It's done. Why then? To happen to you? Jenny, my God. Is Lauren with you? No, she... What happened, Jenny? I shot her. You shot... I shot her. Who do you think Biocorp, the speaker... What the hell happened to her? I can't explain now. Biocorp is at the apartment and they're going to pull me back in six minutes. Sir, I think we should let him finish showing the scientist. He may be the only one left who really knows the machine. He and that girl are plotting against us right now in the past. They had no time to plan that. You and I commander, we're alive in 2017. She could be hovering over our young bodies, planning to kill us in our sleep. I hope she is. You see? You're all the same, power hungry men without a brain among you. And you're all the same, so fierce in your convictions as though they might save you. All due respect, sir, I think we should let the brain activity go to stasis, like he says. Very well. Nico, look, I love you and I miss you, but you have to let me go. No, I'm not gonna lose you. I don't want to go either, but you have to knock me out. No, I don't know what you're talking about. They're gonna wake me in five minutes. No, no, David's not gonna do that unless it's safe. David has a gun to his... No, I'm not going to lose you again. We have no other choice. Please, you have to let me go. Just put me under. Prepare the adrenaline syringe. Let's get this process going. You can't kill her. I told you, you're finished. Wait, if I, if you, let her live, I will help you. I will tell you everything about the machine. I will work for Biocorp like you wanted. With my help, you can use this device to take over the world. There are secrets about this machine that I will tell you only if you let her live. Really? All right. Except, you will tell us these secrets now or I guarantee you, I will let her die. Why can't I just stay here with you? No, no, no, no, you can't. Why not? You can't because, because if you're asleep there, you might die. I don't care. I want to be with you. I want to be with the man that I love. I love you. I'm so sorry about Lauren. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's okay. David, he risked his life for her. It's not your fault, baby. They just, they killed her in cold blood. It's okay, just stay with me. Stay with me, okay? Just be with me. I am. I am. Please, just let her fall asleep. You know this will kill her. What are these secrets? Wake her up properly first. We know the machine works. We have enough information to carry on without you or without her. What are the secrets? You do this, I'll never tell. You've got nothing. The adrenaline. Wait. Tell me the secrets. I will when you, wait, wait, wait, without me, you will fail. Back, back, back, back! Get back, go farther! Shots fired, move, move, move! No, no, no! She'll live. In a better future. No, no! How could you let this happen? You all right? My head. I remember this headache, it's okay. What? Are, are they trying to wake me? They disconnected you, honey. How? They must have had no choice. You're here now. You shouldn't go back. I don't care, I don't care. I just want to be with you. I know, I know. It's okay. We need to find Thomas, babe. She loved him. You know that, don't you? She loved you. Move it now, take your corners. Oh, thank heavens Like usual, you're just in time. Get me a new team and get rid of these bodies. Yes sir. What now? What now? I don't know, but thanks to you, we do know how to go one way. Hello. Hello, is this Mrs. Kyla Torres? Yes, speaking. Mrs. Torres, this is Dr. Raymond Prentice, at the New Jersey fertility center. Yes, hello doctor, how are you doing? Very well, thank you for asking. I'm calling in regards to the recent tests that you've undergone here at the hospital. Yes, yes, doctor. How'd they come out? Well Mrs. Torres, I'm sorry to have to tell you this, there's really no easy way of saying it but, all of the tests have come back and they're fairly conclusive. In fact, they are 100% conclusive. I'm afraid you are completely infertile. Beyond adoption or surrogacy, I'm afraid you will never have children. Mrs Torres, I am... Mrs. Torres? Mrs. Torres, are you there? Mrs. Torres. You are our future. She has something in common. Infertility. Oh my God. He was right. He was right. Hey Thomas. Thomas. Are you crazy? Put the gun down. We're committed here, Nico, right? We came here with a job to do and now we have to finish it. Right, but put the gun down. What did you lose your mind? Where's Jenny? She's uh, she's in the motel. How is she still here? David, he's uh, he did what he had to do. She's here with us now. Lucky me. Always the third wheel. It's gonna be okay, bud. I feel so alone, Nico, in a way I thought I'd never feel. We're in this together. I know. We're gonna find a way home. What are we going home to? The future. The future buddy. We've got the future. The future. The future? You have your future! You have Jenny! You have everything! Lauren is gone! A future without Lauren? For me? There is nothing left to see. I understand, but... No, no. No you don't. No you don't. I get that you loved her. I get that she's your sister. I really do, I really do, but you did not love her. Look, that is not my fault. That is not my fault! Yes it is because you allowed this to happen! We left them and we shouldn't have. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, I'm sorry. Okay, it's all right. No, I'm not blaming you. I know exactly, exactly where the blame lies. We need to get our heads straight, okay? We're in danger. We're in danger? No, Jenny told me everything. They got the machine. They're sending people back. They're gonna be quick and they're gonna be brutal. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, Nico, you hear? Biocorp aren't the bully. Here, we're the killers. Biocorp, they're just babies. We're not killers. We're not killers. Yes we are Nico. We've killed. How many people have we killed? So many I don't even remember. And we need to kill a few more. You know what we need to do? We need to kill just a few more. We have to kill every employee, every colleague, every investor, every friend, every mother, every child of anything to do with Biocorp. We have to leave no place standing. We didn't move here to kill children, Thomas. If we leave Biocorp standing, Nico, that's exactly what we do. The global biological clock is ticking against us. At this time, Almost as if I wrote it myself. I can't believe everyone thinks that's the real John Williams. Well, I'm not interested in being famous. I just wanna fix this big mess here. Kyla. Oh, you again. Me again. I just want you to know, I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything wrong. Kyla, I'm not here about that today. Okay, well, I took your warning very seriously and its been all I can think about and I even went to... Kyla, Kyla. What? I'm here to ask for a favor. What? I need you to help me with access to the Biocorp internal network. No, I, I, I can't... Oh my God, holy... Shut up. Shut up, Kyla. Calm down. Stop talking! I need the names and addresses of every Biocorp employee. What, why do you need that? Stop talking and start listening! Okay... Because the more you talk, the angrier I get, and the angrier I get, the more I remember you killed a whole load of my friends and then I just want to blow your brains out. Okay, okay, okay. We can access it from my house, okay? We can do that. We can do that at my house, okay? Okay? Is this your car? Yes, yes, it's right here. Yeah. Then let's go. Okay. After you. You know what, you really don't need that. Actually I do because I don't trust anybody or anything. I told you that you can trust me. After seeing what you become in the future? Why, I'll pass. So what, no faith that humans can change for the better? Not really. What happened to you? What made you so goddamn cynical? Oh nothing big, just all my friends and all my family died. Everybody I've ever known is gonna die and the woman I love, I left to die. I saw society tear itself apart for an idea that was supposed to save us, all from your company. But that's not my fault. Actually, it is. But you can change that. Put all the information on this. Whatever you want. Okay. This is everything. Done. Well done, Kyla. What you're doing is saving lives, starting with your own. Don't forget what I said. Don't do anything stupid. I promise. We'll see. God, give me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change and the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Oh my... Commander. Sir. Report. We completed repairs on the machine and after reviewing David's notes, I think we're ready to successfully send back a volunteer. Well done. Hm. Hm. You may proceed. I'll inform the president. Yes, sir. Hey, you okay? Yeah, I'll be okay. She died trying to save your life. She never gave up, not until the end. So stubborn. She kind of reminds me of someone. I know he loved her. Our father loved her so much more than me. I was pretty much invisible to him. I think that's why I hated her growing up. Well that and she used to steal my toys. Well you got over that eventually, right? Yeah. Yeah, I did. You know, for the longest time, she was, she was my only friend. And you meant the world to her. God, it's my fault. No, it's not. I shouldn't have left, honey. You had to. No, I had a choice. Here she comes. No, no, just, look, I knew they were going to raid the apartment. I felt it in my gut and you know what? I still took the chance on it. I left you guys alone and her and, I don't, we went on a stupid mission to save the world and just made everything worse. No, you did what you had to do. A lot of people have had to die. A lot. Babe, you are a good man. You've always been a good man. How do you know? Because I married you and I see it day in and day out. And if what I say isn't enough to convince you, just know that the doctor told me that you are too. He made it? Yeah, he was in our time. He helped us. I didn't think he'd remember after all this time. How could he forget? You saved his father's life. That was Thomas. No, it was both of you. He hadn't seen you in 20 years and he still gave his last moments to you. Doesn't that speak volumes? Yeah, but you know, just, it's just been hard. A lot of people have had to die so we can save lives. I know. It's been hard for all of us. And Thomas, he's... Thomas, he doesn't have it anymore. He never really did. I don't know what he's gonna do. It's Thomas we're talking about. Hello. Hi. What is it that you have there? It's my ladybug. Oh, it's a big one. It's the biggest I've ever seen. It's pretty. I'm gonna take it home as a pet. Oh, that's nice of you. My brother's gonna hate it. He doesn't like creepy crawly things. Your brother. I bet he's nice too. Not when he's sleepy. Do you want to hold it? Who me? Yes you, silly. Okay. Wow, she's pretty like you. Can I have it back now? Yeah, sure. There you go. I have to go feed her. You know, lettuce is good for ladybugs. How do you know? How do I know? I mean, I used to have a ladybug as a pet. Really? Yeah. My sister used to bring 'em home to me when I was a little boy. That's what I do. Sweetie, time to go. I have to go now. Bye. Okay, bye bye. What's for dinner? Oh my God, okay. So are you trying to give me a heart attack? Perhaps. What do you want now? What? I see why you're childless, Kyla. Why, because I can't cook? No, because you don't deserve one. What, wait, wait, did something happen? Oh yes. Things have changed, Kyla. I gave you everything you wanted. I gave it to you all, I gave it to you... Not quite, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, not quite. You left out a vital piece of information and I'm not sure why. I don't know what you're... What are you doing? I asked you for a list of every single Biocorp employee. Okay, okay. And what did you give me? Everybody in the U.S.? Wait, um... Why would you do that? Because I just wasn't thinking clearly and you're always holding a gun to my head and you didn't ask me exactly what you wanted. Okay, okay, okay. Well, I need everybody. So do you understand what I want? Okay, yes, yes, yes. Then get it for me, Kyla. Okay, I can do that. Okay, okay. okay. Okay. Did I ever tell you, Kyla, that you really remind me of somebody I once knew? No. She had beautiful eyes, just like you. Smile that could light up a room. But she's not here anymore because of you people. Okay. Okay. Okay. How long, Kyla? Okay, it's coming. It's coming right now. Okay, just give me one, just give me, okay, that's all. Okay, it's coming out, okay? Okay. Okay. These are all of the Biocorp employees in the world. Tokyo, London, and Paris, you have everything now. It's in your hands, that's it. I gave you everything you wanted. That's it. So there's nobody missing from this list? No, no. I promise, this is it. I promise. I believe you. You wouldn't lie to me, would you? No. No, no, I told you, I told you. I told you. You can trust me. Sorry Kyla, just can't take the risk anymore. Commander. Our volunteer's ready to go, sir. There's a change of plans. Sir? The president demanded that we no longer waste time, instructed me to send my best soldier to hunt down and kill these three traitors if they are still alive. I'll complete this mission for Biocorp personally, sir. Commander, I am counting on it. You're dismissed, get out. So I believe he shot that girl because he knew she would be disconnected and safe in 27 days. I agree with that logic. I think they must all still be alive. You must find them. And then? Yes sir. Son, is it ready? Yes, sir. Well give it to him. Yes, sir. Thank you. What's this? I'm assuming they did what they were supposed to do. This will allow you to find every member of the Biocorp family. Chip locator? Well, we'll see. Young man, does this work? Working perfectly, sir. Yes. Commander, we are pulling you back in 24 hours. If you don't accomplish your mission by then, don't bother to put yourself to sleep. Understand? Understood. Good luck. Let's start this process, please. (dramatic orchestral music) Thomas, hello, please call me back, okay? We've been, we've been calling you for hours. All right, please call me. I hope he's okay. Yeah. Maybe he just needs time alone, you know, after everything that happened. I didn't go run and hide. Son of a bitch. Nico, everyone mourns differently. Yeah, but he could have at least called me. Where the hell have you been? I've been talking care of things that need to be taken care of. And getting a little drunk on the way. Where did you go? I killed Kyla. Who? An infertile Biocorp employee. Thomas you can just go... Why not? She had information we needed, now I have it. And she understood. What about second chances? There's no second chances anymore, Nico. What's this? Huh? That's the name and address and next of kin of every Biocorp employee in the whole wide world. How many people are on this list? 1,980. Dear God. Thomas, there's no way we're gonna convince that many people of anything. I'm not trying to talk anybody into anything anymore. What do you mean? What he means, Jenny, he's talking about killing all of these people. What? What, are you a mass murderer now? Is that it? You know what? I haven't been here long enough to hear your two guys' plan, but if it's any better than mine, I'm all ears. Well you know, any plan is better than killing 2,000 people, Thomas. Those people on that list, they deserve to die. They don't deserve to be, are you kidding me? Have you forgotten what they did to us? What they will do. What? They haven't done anything yet, Thomas. But they will. Oh God, so wait, you're the judge, the jury, and the executioner now? Is that what you want? You're judging me again? Yeah. Talking down to me because I got slightly more blood on my hands than you do? No, I've never quite been able to get up to that Nico standard as usual, no... I've never said that. No, I've let you down. I'm not good enough for you. I've never been good enough for you. I've never done that! And I've never been good enough for your sister either. You keep her out of this. What a surprise. We're not gonna talk about her. Both of you just stop. Listen, Thomas, we don't have the time or the resources to reach out to all these people on the globe. Then we wait for a time when everyone on that list is in the same place, at the same time, which isn't as hard as you might think. Don't you worry, buddy, I got it covered. You need to stop drinking. Gimme that drink, that's enough. I haven't had nearly enough to drink. And that is still a good plan. What about this butterfly effect you always talk about, huh? That's 2,000 people. That's a lot bigger than what you're talking about! I don't know, but isn't it worth trying? Just think about it, guys. Please for a minute, think about it. If everybody on that list goes, Biocorp is gone. It doesn't exist. Our home is safe. We can go home and we can toast to a world without genocidal criminals at our doorstep! You're calling them genocidal? Absolutely. And what does that make you? A goddamn hero. Jenny please, wait, Jenny. The names on this list, all the information is enough to save the whole world and all we have to do is execute it. That's it, please. Look, I am not killing 2,000 people, Thomas. But it will save 6,000,000,000 so what does it matter? What is there to think about? This is a no brainer. It's a coward solution! It's simple statistics, Nico. You need to sober up. It will save Lauren. It will save Lauren. Do you get that? Do you know what the professor said? We cannot change the past. I'm not trying to change the past. I'm trying to fix our future. That's this future, Thomas. What we experienced was the future, okay? What happened, happened. No, no, cause we're here and we're changing things all the time, every minute. Yes, I know we're changing things. We're changing the future, not the past. You know that for sure, do you? You don't know that. So you won't even try? And you? Then I'll do it alone and I'll save us. I'll save us all. So smart. You're really smart, you know that Thomas? Thomas! - You're so smart. - What? We all lost her. All of us. Yeah, but you know what? We've got a chance to save her and he chooses not to. Look at him standing there staring at me, looking at me like I'm the coward. Stop, stop it! She wouldn't want you to do this. Stop it, you're both best friends. You forget about that? Yeah, I've forgotten. You know what else, Jen? Doesn't really matter what Lauren would have wanted. She's not here anymore, is she? He's gonna be okay. He needs to sober up. I don't know, I don't know. We're losing him. I think we already lost him. You know what, babe? You know what the sad thing is? I can't even say he's wrong. Maybe we can't save the world. Maybe it's not a possibility. We just have to save as many as we can. I already lost my sister. And now this. No, no. He's the one that we have to save. Don't give up on him. He's talking out of love. They told me you were still here. Where else would I be? What is it? What's wrong? Is it the rebels? I was thinking about Jack. Jack? Yeah. You know it's been like 20 years now. You realize that? I know he meant a lot to you and yet you never talk about him. I think about him a lot more often than you realize. Well you think these men, these ones who traveled from the past, you think they killed him? I think, it makes perfect sense. I've seen that look in your eye before. Think before you act. You know something? The last thing in the world I need right now is a lecture from you about how I'm supposed to act or what I'm supposed to do because I already did everything I could the way you wanted. What I want? I see you don't want a child. You want us to die out. I abused my power. I trifled with my power. I did everything I could in my power to get what you wanted. You're right. I'm just, I'm just trying to help you do what's best for all of us and part of that is what's best for you and me. I'm trying. We did this once before. You almost died. Forgot about that? Listen, I, I want to have a child. Of course I do. I just don't want to lose you in the process, okay? Excellent, this'll be the easiest hunt of my life. Sync and corrected by pepelepew
