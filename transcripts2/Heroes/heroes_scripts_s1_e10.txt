 To everything there is a season. And a time to every purpose. The world needs to know about my findings. That's all that's important. It is one thing to publish a book in the comfort of the university. It is another to leave everything behind. You're chasing a theory that is pure fantasy. The Earth spins at a thousand miles an hour as we desperately try to keep from being thrown off. Like the first blush of winter that signals the great migration. Was there any warning of their arrival? She has a name. Jessica.

 A sign? A single event that set this chain into motion? This is what you've been waiting for. Was it a whisper in God's ear? Be the one we need. Survive. Adapt. Escape. And if we could mark that single moment in time, that first hint of the prophecy of approaching danger... I found a tape of a conversation my father had with a man named Sylar. Hello, Chandra. You made me this way. Would we have done anything differently? Could this have been stopped?

 You helped me to discover my potential. Or was the die long ago cast? And if we could go back, alter its course, stop it from happening, would we? My name is Hiro Nakamura. I'm here to save your life. Hey, Charlie. Charlie, come on over here and blow out the candles. Hold that thought, okay? I just got to make a wish. Come on. Hi. Come on, honey. Pretty please, listen. Very important. Say cheese. Can I help you? I hope so, Mr. Gray. I can fix it. My watch isn't broken. Actually, it is. The self-winding coil is loose. Your watch is running two seconds slow. How could you know? Just a talent I have for the way things work, how parts should go. That looks rather complicated. That... The body is standard, but the parts, the insides, are German. 1917. I've been working on it for seven years. How much do I owe you? Oh, please. Don't worry about it. You didn't come here for the watch? I came to find you, Gabriel. My name is Chandra Suresh. I'm a geneticist. I have a theory about human evolution, and I believe you are a part of it. Read it. If you'd like to talk more, I've written my phone number and address inside. License and registration? Oh, this isn't my car. I kind of stole it. Can you take off your glasses for me, please? I'm gonna have to ask you to step out of the car. No, I don't feel like it. That wasn't a suggestion. Well, here's a suggestion. Why don't you go get back in your car and eat a dozen donuts. That is what you cops like to do, right? I said step out of the car. Now. I think you really want to eat some donuts. Major developments! Lori Trammel skanked her way through the entire football team. Who told you that? The entire football team. Anyway, somehow she found shame and resigned. Turned in her pom poms. I'm in? Are you kidding? Claire, destiny is calling you. Come on, try it on. You can model. I'll take pictures. We'll totally commiserate the event. I think you mean commemorate, and I'll try it on later. Okay, most girls can't wait to get their uniforms on. I mean... Except Lori Trammel. She can't wait to take it off. Why do you have to be like that? Okay, first of all I've earned that, and if you don't want it or this... Kristy Chan is salivating for your position. No! I want it. I do. Then show it. Show me some S-P-l-R-l-T. I'm not gonna drool. Then prove it, Claire. Prove it. Oh, my God. What were you girls doing? Oh, this is gonna need stitches. I'm gonna take her to the emergency room. Jackie, honey, grab my purse. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hello. Mr. Bennet? Yes. My name is Chandra Suresh. I need to speak to you about your daughter, Claire. Oh, no, I teleported from the future. Do not go to work tomorrow. Very, very... Wow, huh? It wasn't raining yesterday. April showers. It's been storming all week. April? No, no. October. No. April 24th. It's my birthday. Birthday cake? Happy birthday. Hi, my name is Niki, and I'm an alcoholic. Hi, Niki. I'm one year sober today. Happy anniversary! I work 60 hours a week. I stink of cigarettes. I got a kid so smart that he is flunking out of school. My husband can't find a job because no one wants to hire an ex-con. There's a leak in the roof, and I'm feeling thirsty. Feels like too much for one person. So, why are you here? I don't want another year to go by without you in my life, Nicole. You know, not being in your life was never my choice. You kind of made that happen. Look, I know how you feel about me. Lord knows I deserve it. I was awful to you and everyone I ever met. You weren't awful, you just weren't there. You can't be awful if you're not present. You know, I'm married now. I heard. Look, Nicole... I would love to meet him sometime. I... I... I really want to get to know my grandson, and my son-in-law, and you. Yeah, well, I don't know if I'm ready to get to know you. Hey. How's it going? Ladies, 10 and a half. Oh, you know, the reason I became a nurse was to wear shoes like this. Thank you very much. Of course. Get a drink? Yeah, yeah. It's right inside. Hi. I told him it wasn't funny. I know. Hey, Mom. Hello, sweetheart. How are you? Come on in. Good. Your father is very proud of you. And still, he couldn't make it. Well, he had a meeting. Mr. Linderman's in Atlantic City with... Listen, I did this without his blessing and without his money. Okay, so, I think it's only right that we celebrate without him. I have always wanted a nurse in the family. We have enough lawyers. Thanks, Mom. So, Peter, have you chosen a specialty? I'm thinking hospice care. Yeah. Taking care of dead people? They're not dead. They're dying. And I think it's noble. Thank you. What's it pay? Oh, honey, you know, I'm gonna go call the sitter and when I come back, you are gonna dance with me. What's going on? D.A. Wants me to prosecute Linderman. Dad's biggest client? Yeah. Well... D.A. Thinks Linderman's mob ties run so deep, if I can take him down, the empire will crumble. You do that though, dad will go down, too. We used to tell him he was a criminal for protecting criminals. Here's a chance to set things straight. Take the stink off the family name. He's still our father. No matter what he's done. You go after him, you're never gonna forgive yourself. Ever. Come on, handsome. Hold this for me, will you? Yeah. May I? So, what? You're gonna cut me open? I'd like to run some tests. EEG, EKG, nothing invasive. A friend at Columbia has access to an MRI. Mapping the brain. Measuring alpha waves, resting rates, neuron clusters. The brain controls every human action, voluntary or involuntary. Every breath, every heartbeat, every emotion. If the soul exists, scientifically speaking, it exists in the brain. When I was a kid, I used to wish some stranger would come and tell me my family wasn't really my family. Well, they weren't bad people, they were just insignificant. And I wanted to be different, special. I wanted to change, a new name, a new life. The watchmaker's son became a watchmaker. It is so futile, and I wanted to be important. You are important, Gabriel. What do you think my abilities might be? Grand theft auto, larceny, robbery, arson, and suspected of murder in Oklahoma. That's no way for a lady to behave, now, is it? You need a goal, Eden. A purpose. Let me go. Now. You know, with your ability you can get anything you want. Created your own morality. Wasn't a person in the world who could say no to you. Now there is. Great Scott! Matt. What are you doing? What? What are you doing sitting here? The detective test is in an hour. Right. You're not chickening out, are you? No. No, man, of course not. All right, good, because second time is the charm for you. I can feel it. Just don't go being a nervous wreck this time, okay? What's up with the donut? You're just like a walking clich?. Yeah, well, you know what? After today I am going to be a different man. Confidence. I like that. Right. Let's go crush it. Hello. What's up? Hey. Oh, I don't know what we'd do without you, Hiro. You have such an amazing attitude. I have gift for you. Happy birthday. Oh. A Japanese phrase book. I love it. Oh, now we can understand each other better. Maybe you visit Japan very soon. Get out of Midland, far away. You speak Japanese very quickly. Lately, I've just been able to remember everything. You have power. Big memory. It will only get stronger in the future. The future. Right. I keep forgetting that's where you come from. You don't believe me? I bend time and space. Oh, yeah, of course you do. Charlie, honey, your order's up. Hey. Where'd these come from? Flower store. Two blocks from here. Funny. Oh, Oh, hang on. I have an order up. Already finished. Lynnette, you have got to see this. Hiro's a magician. Oh, no. It's... It's not a trick. A very, very bad man is going to come here and... Tomorrow the swallow will slay the dragon. Having a drink with your sister? Thinking about it. Used to be, I couldn't go an hour without missing Jessica. It's important not to forget. Hal is back. He came to one of my meetings. He wants to meet you and Micah. He won't meet anybody unless you want him to. He's got money. He really could... He could help with tuition, and get Micah into that private school. If you want to have Hal over, let's have him over for dinner. We can all say a prayer for Jessica. My brother Peter, the hospice nurse, can you believe it? It's just... Oh, it's a perfect fit. He's selfless and empathic. He's self-centered and righteous. Self-righteous. He's a hell of a lot nicer than you. He can afford to be. He hasn't been under as much scrutiny. My dad did what he had to do to take care of this family, and that's something that Peter is never going to understand. And you do? It's my responsibility. It's my inherited birthright. I didn't ask to be dad's favorite. I never asked to be loved more than Peter, but that's just the reality. What does this guy want? Nathan! Heidi! Nathan! Heidi! Hello? Hey. How is she? She's been in surgery for 10 hours. It's something with her back, her spine. I should probably call Mom. She's got the kids. It's what Heidi would do. Can I have your phone? Yeah. You're not hurt? No. I landed 300 feet away from the wreck. Couldn't tell you how I got there. Couldn't tell you much of anything at this point. Listen, look, yeah, that's a bad cut. You need to lie down. No, not until Heidi's all right. Just gonna sit. Do you remember the other car? What? In the accident. Who told you that? Who told you that? I had a dream right before you called. My wife's in surgery and you're dreaming. That's great. There was another car, wasn't there? Nathan? Wasn't there? Yeah. It was Linderman's guys. Must have found out about the D.A.'s plans. It's my fault for even considering it. Hey! Hey! Taking them on. Look at me. Look at me. This is... This is not your fault. This is dad's fault, okay? And you know... You know that this is not gonna end. Lf... If I agree to take the D.A.'s case will you give a deposition? Huh? Yeah. Against your father? Mr. Petrelli? Yes? Please. They did it! See? The swallows slay the dragons. "The Tokyo Swallows defeated the Chunichi Dragons yesterday "with a surprising rally with two out in the ninth." What? What is this? Baseball? You read Japanese flawless in one day. You have power. I have power, too. Okay. So because you knew this baseball was going to win, I'm supposed to believe you're from the future. There is an ancient Japanese tradition. Origami. Folding paper. I read about that. Yeah, it says if a person can fold 1000 cranes, you'll be granted one wish. Yes. How did you... A trip to Japan? I don't care if you don't believe me, just... Please tell me you'll go. Only one ticket? Just in case you said yes. Why do you repair watches, Gabriel? My father didn't really give me a choice. Yes, but why not do what you want to do? Why not change? You use a phrase in your book. Evolutionary imperative. That which we are destined to do. Sea turtles die on the exact same beach where they were born. Lions slaughter gazelles. Spiders eat their young. They don't want to, they have to. Well, the good news is you're healthy. You mean normal? What? There are still no signs? No. Well, maybe tomorrow. We're still going to this CT scan, right? I think we should prepare for the possibility that I may have been wrong. You may not have a special ability. I am so close. I can feel it. You came to me. I am on your list. These tests aren't 100 percent. Don't give up on me. There are other opportunities I need to focus on. Oh, what, these people? Huh? They're important? This guy? Brian Davis, you think he's telekinetic? Move things with his mind? Or are you just going to toss him aside, too? You'd better leave now, Mr. Gray. Wow. That's a very generous gift, Hal. Oh, it's amortized over 10 birthdays. Well, then, you skimped. Thanks, Grandpa. It's my pleasure, young man. Now, go break the Internet in half or something. If I could buy stock in that kid right now... I wish his teachers saw it that way. We want to move him into a private school. It's just, you know, we're trying to figure out the details. Details? If you're trying to ask me for something, it's already yours. It's a man's God-given right to dote on his grandson. Thank you. It'd make a really big difference for us. You know, I feel lucky that you let me through the door after all the things I've done. Stop saying that. You didn't do anything. Why do you keep doing that? Doing what? You... You're only as sick as your secrets, Nicole. I know the mantras, Hal. I've been reciting them for over a year. Well, I'm... I guess I'll go see what the boy's up to now. You are doing great. What the hell is this? You've torn the whole damn computer apart! That computer cost $2000. Hey. What the hell do you think you're doing? You okay? I have no business being here. Then why did you bother? I owe you more than an apology can ever do. What am I supposed to do with this? I don't know. Make your life easier, I don't care how, okay? What did you do that was so bad that I can't have my father back? You really don't remember, do you? So, what's going to happen to my Claire? How is this genetic abnormality going to affect her? I don't know. It's possible that nothing might ever happen. It's possible. I might be wrong. Where did you find this picture? Union Wells High School website. She's growing up so quickly now. Couldn't do anything to stop it. You cannot, try as you might. Do you have a daughter? How old is she? She was five. I'm so sorry. Mutations are mostly cancers or diseases meant to eliminate a species. Shanti had a genetic anomaly, and that was the portal into my research. My hope is that no one will suffer as she did. If you do figure this out, what happens then? We can change the world. Give people hope for the future. That is your daughter's destiny. I'd very much like to meet her. You can see how that might be a problem for my family. Yes, of course. Let... Let me think on this, on the best way to proceed. Well, I appreciate you coming, Mr. Bennet. It was educational. You do remember. Oh, how could I forget? Nicole! Not Niki. It's me, Daddy. Jessica. The daughter that you threw beer bottles at, the daughter that you choked, the daughter that you killed. I didn't kill anyone. No, it was an accident. They left Niki with you to be your punching bag. I came to apologize, Nicole. Apologize? You don't apologize to Nicole. You apologize to me. Niki doesn't remember, but I do. Someone had to be there to protect her. I remember the stink of alcohol on your breath. I took every punch so that she wouldn't have to. You are not Jessica. You have no idea who I am. Nicole, you need help. You're right. She does. I thought she had learned to protect herself, but no such luck. You're going to go away and never come back. Cheerleading, huh? What do you think? I think I can't wait to go to my first game. Ah, well, you might be getting a little bit old the bears from around the world, but... No, I'm not. No? I love my bear. Aw. Am I a terrible person? What are you talking about? I want to be a cheerleader. I mean I've worked hard to be a cheerleader, but... sometimes Jackie can just be a... A bitch? Yeah, a bitch. No, it's your actions that make you good or bad. Cheerleader or not. Let's take a look at that hand. The pain went away, but I think it's still kind of... Well, that's healed really nicely. Hey, baby. You hungry? Thought I'd make some eggs, carbonara style. Does that sound good? I didn't pass again. You studied so hard. It's not about the answers, Jan. I know all the answers. I don't know why you don't just tell them the truth. Yeah, I'll just waltz in there and tell them that I can barely read. Half the words I see backwards. There's a good career move. My baby. Don't. Come on. A little morning sex, some eggs, and everything is gonna seem so much better. How can you want to kiss me? You're my hero. Don't you know that? Hey. You are everything that I want. I'm your hero. I'm your hero. Look at me. Eleven years and I am still directing traffic. Hey. I'm ready to give the deposition. There isn't going to be one. What are you talking about? You can't back out now. We've got to tell the D.A. Everything about Linderman, about Dad, all of it. Dad's dead. He had a heart attack this morning. Just take comfort in the fact that he didn't know his sons were about to stab him in the back. Charlie! Charlie! Twenty-four-hour samurai film festival at the Drafthouse in Austin. Austin? That's over 300 miles away. We can make it in time to see Yojimbo, Seven Samurai and Hidden Fortress. It'd be perfect for our trip to Japan. You still do want to go? Yeah. Oh, yeah, no, it's not that. It's just... Ever since I met you, I don't know, you just make so happy. You make me happy, too. Well, it's more than that. I don't let people get very close. There's a blood clot in my brain, inches away from an aneurysm. I'm dying. But I'm supposed to save you. You did. You did. Before you got here I'd decided to give up. But you have made me feel more alive and more full of joy than I could have ever imagined. Hiro... Charlie? No. Charlie? Charlie? Charlie? Can I help you? Yeah. Uh, somebody called me. My name is Brian Davis. Yes, I called you. My name is... My name is Sylar. Gabriel Sylar. That's incredible. Can you make it go away? Why would you want to do that? I... I don't know what this is, or who I might hurt. I... I don't want it. You're broken. What? Suresh was right. It's so clear now. How it all works, pieces fitting together. It is in the brain. So, you can help. Don't worry, Brian. I can fix it. It's an evolutionary imperative. Whatever bad you've done in the past, it's over. You have a rare opportunity to start again, to rewrite the past, to do better. But if you're not interested we could just put you back in your old life. Odds are you'd be dead in a week. What do you want me to do? There's a professor. Dr. Suresh. He has a list of names. You're going to get Claire Bennet's name off that list. I'm sorry about the glass. It's just glass. About the other day, I should've behaved myself. That was uncalled for. I'm sorry. You were angry. A man can say and do the most awful things when he's angry. Well, I'm different now. I feel I've been given a chance to start over. A new life, new identity, a new purpose. I came half way around the world looking for proof, and I threw him out the door. No one returns my phone calls anymore. They all think I'm insane. I don't. These people are all out there waiting to be told that they are important, waiting to unlock their true potential. I know it. I can feel them. We'll find them together. We are the future. Hiro? Hiro! This list... You found them. These people... Their future is written on their DNA just as the past it seems is written in stone. I have something I have to tell you. Was the die cast from the very beginning? Or is it in our own hands to alter the course of destiny? Of all our abilities, it is free will that truly makes us unique. With it we have a tiny but potent chance to deny fate. And only with it can we find our way back to being human. I loved her. You're sweet. I'm sweet! I can go back. Six months? I've got to get back. If I teleport again I could end up anywhere. Lunch for a T-Rex! I'm stuck! Yamagato Industries. Ando Masahashi, please. Ando I need you help... Sorry, Ando is sick. This is Hiro Nakamura. May I help you? You are a kind and generous man. You don't undersatnd. I'm trying to save your life. I love you. Aren't you and Ando supposed to be... on vacation in America? I jumped. Dammit! I have to get back to her. I have to get back to Charlie. You're okay! No. I'm not okay. What are you talking about? You teleported back! I took the bus. I teleported. Forward. Backward. But I couldn't save her. I couldn't save Charlie. So, try again It won't work. This power... It's bigger than me. I can't change the past. No matter how hard I wish. I failed.
