Your mother told me that you've been asking about your birth parents. I think it's time that I knew. I really do believe that this is an adult decision, Claire. There are gonna be issues. Trust me. I actually know a few things. Is this your husband, miss? Yeah. We'll leave a squad car outside incase your husband decides to show, Miss Sanders. Hello?

 Peter Petrelli, my name is Hiro Nakamura. I'm from the future. And I have a message for you. When I call you, you must tell where we meet. Save the cheerleader! Save the world! Wait. Hiro? Where are you? He said something bad is going to happen, but we can stop it. There are no answers. Go home, Peter. Isaac, I need your help. Something is gonna happen to this girl. We need to know what. This painting, I can finish it. Evolution is an imperfect and often violent process, a battle between what exists and what is yet to be born. In the midst of these birth pains, morality loses its meaning. The question of good and evil reduced to one simple choice,

 survive or perish. We have to save her. Ignore it. It's a wrong number. Some Japanese guy keeps calling, leaving messages. Hello? Mr. lsaac? lsaac Mendez? Who is this? My name is Hiro Nakamura. My name is Peter Petrelli. I have a message for you. What message? Save the cheerleader, save the world. What cheerleader? Where? I don't know where she is. Yeah, but you painted these. So did you. We don't know who she is. We don't know where she is. We just know that we need to save her. Tell them about the guy from the future. He is the guy from the future. A Hiro Nakamura from the future who speaks English and carries a sword stopped time to tell me that I have to save the cheerleader. That's all I know. Get to New York. We'll find out where the cheerleader is. Grab that side. I must be missing something, some sign of where they are. See, these paintings they fit together like pages in a comic book. There's a panel missing. What was right there? Nothing. This is everything I painted last night. But there's a piece about that size. I painted it weeks ago. Simone has it. Simone? She took a bunch of my paintings to sell. It's with them. What was it of? I don't remember. I was high. Then we need to get it back. Tell her a guy from the future said you needed it. I'm sure she'll love that. DeeDee wants to breed Mr. Muggles with her poodle. A poodle, for God's sake. They call it a pomapoo or a pooranian. Mr. Muggles doesn't want anything to do with a breed that has poo in its name. "No, I don't," says Mr. Muggles. Honey, I think we left those cupcakes in too long. Smells like something's burning. They look okay. I thought Mr. Muggles doesn't like poodles anyway. Not after what happened at the dog park. I thought that big dog was going to chew your hand off. Which would have put an end to your cheerleading career. It looked worse than it was, and my cheerleading career is scissor-kicking off the field as we speak. At least I'm playing my part in the bake sale. Cupcake? Only a dollar for a very good cause. Not right now, Claire Bear. You've been on the phone for an hour. Who've you been talking to? Yeah, about that. You know how you've been wanting to meet your biological parents? Yeah? I just got off the phone with them. Turns out they want to meet you, too. Tommorrow. Wait just a minute. What about school? We can't just drop everything for these people. Who do they think they are? I didn't say yes. Nobody's dropping anything, unless Claire wants us to. This doesn't have to happen now. You don't have to do this. Not unless you're absolutely ready. I'm ready. You look beautiful, Nik. D.L.? How the hell did you get in here? The police are right outside. If I scream, they will be in here in two seconds. Then I hope you don't scream. You're not wearing your wedding ring. I think that you better leave. You being here, come on, that's not a good idea. Micah doesn't need this. Micah needs his father. And I need my wife. This is still my home. I'm not going anywhere. You can either believe me or not. I'm going to check on our boy. Open the door, ma'am. I'll let you get the door. Ma'am, please open the door. Ma'am, we thought we heard something inside the house. Is everything all right? I was just talking with my son. Well, if you need anything, we'll be out here until tomorrow morning, okay? Is something wrong? If you want us to come inside just nod your head. I'm fine. You know, God, it's just been a really long night. We'll let you get back to bed, okay? Just remember, we're here if you need us. Thank you. You're welcome. Good night. ...location. Suspect seen in alley heading west. Okay, so, tell me what happened. I planned the job. I know that you planned the job. "Baby, it's going to solve all our problems." it was $2 million, enough to get us out of Vegas. Money that you stole from Linderman. And if we ran with Linderman's money he wouldn't just kill me. He'd kill you, Micah. So, I stepped out. Only someone stepped in after me. Someone who knew the plan. Someone who killed my crew. Oh, and they just made off with all the money? You have no idea who that is? I know it was a woman. Woman? There's a guy in North Vegas, cleans money. Heard he just cleaned somebody $2 million. So I'm going to pay him a visit tomorrow and see if I can squeeze a name out of him, baby. Baby, don't worry. How am I supposed to ask someone if they're a freak when they're probably just going to lie about it like I do? Why don't you just ask them what happens when they cut themselves? Or you could just cut them and find out. Probably just think I was all bitter because they gave me away. You're a little bitchy sometimes, but I don't think you're all that bitter. About the adoption thing, I mean. I'm not. I mean, I'm curious about it and it's a little weird and maybe a little sad. But I'm not mad. I mean, I love my parents. What if your biological parents raised you, though? It'd be an entirely different scenario. What if they can do what I can do? What if they're like me? Well, I hope they're not. No offense, but I like... I like that you're the freak. It makes you more special or whatever. Are you flirting with me? No. Believe me, no. Look, do you plan on coming out to your parents? I mean, the ones who raised you? No. My dad would unspool. He's a really simple guy. He'd never be able to wrap his mind around something like that. It would break him. He's gonna find out. It's okay. I just want to talk to you. I told you we no cheat. Japanese people very lucky. Oh, I know you cheated. I just don't know how. Now, it's time for a little payback. Huh? Claire, honey, your guests are here. Hi, I'm Lisa. Nice to meet you. Hi. Sandra. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Hank. Hi, Hank. Sandra. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Sure you don't want me to shove them into something on the way out? Ha, ha. So, how're we going to do this? We don't. You're couching me? What do you think, D.L.? You think you can just strut back in here like nothing's ever happened? Do you have any idea what I've been through the last six months? No. No, you don't. I didn't want to leave you. But you did. It was going fine. We were making it. Oh, 30 grand a year doing construction. That wasn't enough for you? No, Nik, it wasn't enough for me, because that business doesn't fly when you have a family. When you left, I became another person. I don't care that you took off your clothes on the internet. I'm not mad about it. But you did what you had to do. Look, you can stay here tonight, but you need to leave in the morning. If that's what you want. Come to bed. Hey, Japanese guy, you in or not? I'm in. So, what's your system, huh, pal? Some ancient Oriental voodoo? No system. Japanese people very lucky. Japanese people better run out of luck soon. I'm starting to think I'm getting hustled. Easy, Ernie. It's a friendly game. No one's getting hustled. No hustle. Only good fortune. All right, let's go. I'm in for 400. I'll bet 1,000. Sorry. Beg pardon. We must use bathroom. Now? We're in the middle of a hand. Sorry. Must go now. Had too much beer. You guys go to the bathroom together? Yes, it is how we roll. Hey, who invited her? Your hair has gotten so long. It's a mess. I like it. Reminds me of when we first met. God, we were kids. It was fly. You should get some sleep. You didn't get much last night. I slept as much as you did. Mmm-mmm. I heard you getting up. Trying to be all quiet. I did? When? What's wrong, baby? Dad? Oh, I missed you. I missed you, too. I guess the flying Petrelli didn't fly. We were on the train together and suddenly he started carrying on about a mysterious traveler who stopped time and told him to save a cheerleader. It was all very fascinating. I should write a paper on the experience. Maybe you provoked him with sarcasm. Peter Petrelli went from steady as a clam to, as you say, craphouse rat in a blink. No provocation whatsoever. Except maybe from a time traveler. You'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, so would you. Did I tell you that the man who paints the future is a heroin addict? Did you see any of the paintings? I didn't see him. After what I witnessed on the train, I doubt he even exists. Now what? You'll just take Papa Suresh back to lndia? Just get on a plane and that's it? Yes, that's exactly it. Well, what about Mohinder? We were no good for each other anyway. Thank you, Eden, for all that you've done for both me and my father. You're welcome. You know, you can go back and scatter those ashes, but you're always going to wonder if maybe there was something to what your father was doing. If you just looked again. Will I? Oh, yeah. You're not done here. That's why I'm not even going to say goodbye. Goodbye, Eden. See you later. Like I said, see you later. You're still reading these, huh? Remember all those comics my granddad used to have? Tales from the Crypt, Vault of Doom... 9th Wonders! I told you not to read them, but you had to do it anyway. Scared you silly. I am Moorlore, the invincible. I'm sorry for not being around. How's your mom? How's she doing? Okay. You're looking after her, right? Yeah. 'Cause you're the man of the house when I'm not around. I know. I'm trying. Dad, how'd you get out of jail? Between you and me? I walked out. Out of prison? How'd you do it? Ain't no jail that can hold your old man. Why not? Because I got a secret. Like Superman? Yeah, just like Superman. Got a bunch of more comics. Want to see? Big Daddy, go get them. It's going to crush him when you run again. There won't be any more running. Not after today. This is not just going to go away. It will when I get that woman's name. I guess I could hunker down in your back seat, and you can give me a lift. Every cop in Vegas is looking for me. So, you want me to take that risk? I want you to hear that I was set up from the horse's mouth. I know you, Nik. You're starting to believe me because I'm standing here staring you in the face. But once I'm out of your sight, you're going to start to wonder. And I don't ever want you to wonder about me again. She has your mouth and your nose, doesn't she? Yeah, it looks like it, doesn't it? I wonder what else of yours I have. Can I get anybody anything to drink? Lemonade, just made a pitcher from scratch. We have sodas, iced tea. We have cupcakes, don't we, Claire? Just made them last night, the two of us. Sort of a thing we do. Mom. I would love some lemonade. Thank you. Me, too. Claire? Yes, please. Three lemonades coming right up. So, what can we tell you about ourselves? I don't see a welcome mat. It's all right. I know these guys. We used to get stuff done for Linderman. Wasn't that locked? Guess not. Come on. Maybe they moved. They didn't move. Go back to the car. Go back to the car, now. Come on. Let's get out of here. Come on! Come on! Come on! No! Oh. We're not together anymore. As high school sweethearts we didn't even make it to graduation. Once Lisa got pregnant, it was over. He wanted to keep the baby, you. And I didn't. You probably think I'm a bad person for giving you up. No, no, I don't think that. This is so awkward. I've got lip sweat. Should you be eavesdropping? Yes. Oh, I guess. What else are we going to do? So, is there anything I should know, like medically? Nothing weird or out of the ordinary? Well, there is something. I have diabetes. Diabetes. All you've got to worry about from my side of the family is a history of cancer and heart disease. Great. Sorry! Sorry! Hello? Yeah. Yes, how are you? What? Yeah. Hold on just a second. It's work. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead. Suresh just left for lndia. Then stop him. I tried. We both know you can try harder. He's already gone. But he'll be back. What about Peter Petrelli? He claims he can fly, but I don't have confirmation. Also, there may have been an encounter with somebody who can stop time. Really? That's cool. Evidently, he had a message for Petrelli. He told him to save the cheerleader. Are you still there? Yeah. Thanks for the update. So, what do you want me to do with the pre-cog? Bring him in. I've never seen anything like that. I have. In the garage. In the garage? Uh-huh. After you left, I borrowed money from Linderman. How much? Thirty. I got behind on the rent, Micah's tuition. I didn't know what else to do. I'm sorry. When I didn't pay Linderman back on time, he sent two guys to collect. It got physical. I got knocked out. When I woke up, they were dead. And it looked like what we saw today. What? They were torn apart? I have gone over it a thousand times in my head. I didn't see anything, anyone. I was the only person there. It was me. Nik, look at me. You did not do this. No. What if I did? What if I got up in the middle of the night and I went in? Baby, you are being played. Whoever set me up set you up and they're making damn sure I can't clear my name. I don't... But the one thing they're not counting on is us. Us? Mom? Have you seen my backpack? Did you leave it at Tina's? No, I had it when I came home. Okay, honey, will you just give me another minute? We need to tell the police. They'll never believe us. The only way I can clear my name is to find the person that did this myself. Okay, it's been a minute. I'll come help you. Micah. Micah, where'd you get that? Get what? Your backpack. You just gave it to me. I did? Yeah. Mom, you were just in here a few minutes ago. You told me to pack some clothes, and that we're going to Grandma's house. Mom, are you okay? No. No, you know what? I just... I need to go lay down. I'm not feeling well. God, what's happening to me? No! You need to pull yourself together. You're not real. Oh, I am as real as you are. No. No, I have a tumor or something. This is... Poor little crazy girl. ...a hallucination. Is that what you think you are? Oh, we're a lot of things, Niki, but we're not crazy. Micah, where's Mom? She's in her bedroom. She didn't feel good. Yeah. Yeah, she's had a hard day. What do you think D.L. is going to do when he finds out what we've done? What we've done? Are you and Mom going to get back together? Most of the time in relationships when somebody makes a mistake the other person just pretends it didn't happen. But when someone thinks you made a mistake and you didn't, it... it just gets a lot more complicated. We framed him, killed his crew, stole $2 million. We killed those thugs in the garage. We killed those little bitches at the poker game. We've been very busy. Those men were ripped apart. Yeah, well, what can I say? But they didn't do anything to me. Leaving witnesses would be sloppy. I did what had to be done. Like I always do. Are you getting back together or not? I don't know. I hope so. And this is what we're going to do now. You're gonna get the money, and you're going to take Micah as far away from D.L. as you can. I'll do the rest. D.L. can take care of me. I don't need you. Niki, he'll think you're crazy. And then he'll take Micah away from us. He'll put it all together, and when he does, it's really only a question of whether he kills you before he leaves. Dad, you know how you have a secret? Mmm-hmm. Mom has a secret, too. So, you have a choice. You can let D.L. take our son away from us forever or you can do exactly what I say. Where's the money? Good choice. Where's your father? I mean, not your biological father, but, you know, your dad. He's walking out the bio-parents. Is that what you're calling them? The bio-parents? Oh, that's so cold and impersonal and fitting. Thanks again for coming out. I know your visit meant a lot to Claire. When I was her age, I had enough weighing on my head. I'm glad I could help. Thanks. I think that went pretty well. Yeah. If there's anything else you need... I'll keep you posted. Was it what you were hoping for? Not really. I mean, I don't know what I was hoping for. I guess I just wanted them to tell me who I am. They don't know any better than I do. Baby, nobody can tell you who you are. That's just something you've got to figure out for yourself. Can we throw these away? Are they burnt? No, I'm just afraid I'll eat them all if we don't. You know, I have to hand it to your dad. This isn't the first time we've tried to find those bio-parents. It's not? Mmm-mmm. When you were a baby, we thought you had something wrong with your chromosomes, some disease. We needed to screen your parents to see if they were carriers. I was scared to death, and they were nowhere to be found. What kind of disease? How did you know there was something wrong with me? Well, nothing was wrong with you. You were fine. It's just... I don't know, one of those things. What things? I mean, was I doing anything abnormal? You had a cough, Claire. Don't turn hypochondriac on me. Your brother's bad enough. Come on, you. So, was that as scary for you as it was for me? You're a very brave man, Dad. Oh, God. All this time... I can explain. Played me for a fool, set me up. No, I can explain everything. I know... I know what this looks like. No. I loved you, Niki. No, there is this other person. I can't control it. I don't know what's happening to me. I'm taking Micah. And I'm taking the money. Goodbye, Niki. You're not taking anything. Mom, is everything okay? Everything's fine. Your dad and I are just moving furniture. Go to your room. So, this is how you got out of jail. Mom? Isaac Mendez? Who are you? I'm an admirer of your work. May I come in? Evolution is an imperfect and often violent process. Morality loses its meaning. The question of good and evil reduced to one simple choice, survive or perish.
