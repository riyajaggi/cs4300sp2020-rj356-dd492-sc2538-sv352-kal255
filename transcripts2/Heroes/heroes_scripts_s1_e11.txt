 NARRATOR: Previously on Heroes. Trying to hear my thoughts, Matt? Not with my friend here. He's special, too. Everything we say, everything you see, by tomorrow it won't matter.

 Thinks he's supposed to make a difference. You believe him? I'm not sure what to believe anymore. I'm taking Micah, and I'm taking the money. We're going hunting. I told her where we are. She's on her way. (SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) You're not done here. That's why I'm not even going to say goodbye. Now that you know about them, what will you do? Find them. Tell them who they are if they don't already know. Warn them of the dangers they face. I know when and I know where the cheerleader gets attacked. I have to stop him.

 You don't want to hurt me. Go to sleep. How did you... Are you the one? By saving you did I save the world? Put your hands on your head! What are you doing? You're Iucky to be alive. It's not Iuck, Dad. I have something I have to tell you. Are you mad at me? You haven't said anything since we got in the car. Since I told you. No. No. No, I just... I've just been thinking. I have something I need to tell you. It's not fair to keep it from you any Ionger. What you can do... I've known about you, CIaire. I knew before you knew, before you made those tapes with Zach. You saw the tape? Why didn't you say anything? There are a Iot of reasons but mostly I just wanted to protect you. Protect me? AII this time I felt so alone, and... And Iike some sort of freak and you knew? I've worked very hard. I've done some things that I'm not proud of to keep you safe. What kinds of things? I just wanted you to have a normal Iife. Jackie died because of me. He thought she was me, didn't he? That man is taken care of. I promise you. You and Mom knew all this time. Your mother doesn't know, and neither does your brother. Actually, Lyle kind of found out. Really? Anybody else? Zach. Nobody else can know. It's the only way to keep you safe. That man who tried to kill you, there are others out there Iike him who want what you have and will hurt you to get it. That's why we can't tell your mother, we can't tell anybody. Do you understand? Yeah. I'm gonna pick Lyle up from practice and I'II talk to him. You talk to Zach. And the tapes you made, I need you to destroy them. MATT: The victim was a student, Jacqueline Wilcox. And the crime scene fits Sylar's M.O. He took her brain? No, but the incision on her skull said he wanted to but somebody got in his way. Well, they have a suspect in custody, a hospice nurse from New York. And you think he might be Sylar? No. I think this is. See, judging by the blood patterns I'd say he stopped here to catch his breath and then just disappeared. You know what? Maybe he didn't. Look at this. The tread patterns are totally different. These are two new sets of footprints. That's the fourth handful of those you've knocked down since we got off the plane. I have headaches. It's the whole Janice thing. It's... She slipped up, Parkman. It sucks but it happens. You've never cheated on her? No. You don't believe me. Well, statistically speaking, Iaw enforcement attracts a certain kind of male personality. Oh, what personality would that be? Dogs. And the female personality? Bitches. We keep it in the canine family. Okay, so, two new sets of footprints. You think Sylar had accomplices? With the amount of blood he Iost there's no way he got out of here by himself. So, I guess we'II ask this Peter Petrelli. Hey. What are you... What are you doing here? You get in trouble, I drop everything and fix it. Isn't that how things work? Get you out of here soon. What, no Iecture? I'm just glad you're alive. Why did you destroy that painting? Why did you try and keep me from coming here? That painting showed you dead, Peter. And when I got the phone call I nearly believed it for a minute. Yeah, I thought I'd be a hero. Yeah, how did that work out for you? Save the cheerleader, save the world. You're meant to do a Iot of things Peter, but saving the world isn't one of them. You've got to Iearn to recognize when Iife is bigger than you are. You're not a fighter. But that's okay. The world needs nurses, too. When I'm around you I can do what you can do. Isaac, Hiro Nakamura, this girl CIaire. See, I... I think that we're all the same. Somehow this bomb that Isaac painted, I think we're supposed to stop it. I just... I don't think I can do it. That's because you can't. How can you stop what's coming when you don't know anything about power? (GASPING) (GUN FIRING) (GUN FIRING) Micah! Dad! Stay down! What are you Iooking at? Anything? SIept through the night. I got this. You Iost a Iot of blood. We sewed you up the best we could. Turns out you're not so untouchable after all. Oh, no, you'II find your abilities won't work, not here. You're not going anywhere, Gabriel. My name is Sylar. Now it is. Wasn't so Iong ago that you were Gabriel Gray, an insignificant watchmaker. I restore time pieces. You know why I was so good at it? No, why don't you tell me? Because I can see how things work, what makes them tick. Like you. We're interested in how things work as well. Everyone else we've met has had only one ability. You've taken on several. I guess that's what makes me special. That's important to you, isn't it? Being special. It's important to everyone. I think you're insane. I think the infusion of so many alterations to your DNA has corrupted your mind. AII this power is degrading you. And yet here I am, alive and well, and as soon as I get out I'm going to collect one more ability from your daughter. Sweet, innocent... That's enough. ...ripe, indestructible. I said that's enough, Gabriel! My name is Sylar! Options? There are no options with an individual Iike this. Maybe I didn't make the risk clear... Understood. Of course. Is it true? You have to be a Iittle bit more specific, Eden. I've got more than one house on fire at the moment. We're keeping him alive. Those are our marching orders. Think about what he almost did to CIaire. I could tell him to kill himself. No one would have to know. I don't have time for this. Not today. You know I'm right! I know I'm right, and if that Haitian could speak, he'd tell you I'm right. Micah, take that. Pull it down. That's it. Walk back the way you came. In the footsteps. Like the Indians. Just Iike the Indians, son. That wasn't the police. You don't know that. Dad, they've got to warn you before they shoot. It's a rule. Police don't always follow the rules, son. Trust me. Give me a hand. Right here. (GRUNTS) Dad, are you gonna be okay? I'm your dad. I'm gonna be as good as new. I just need you to help me with these bandages. You can do that, right? Yeah. AII right. It was her, wasn't it? It was Jessica. Sure Iooked Iike your mom. Mom would never hurt you on purpose. She just did, Micah. A couple inches to the Ieft and... Dad? Dad, wake up! Dad, you need to wake up! Your brother's pretty well connected. Even down here. We had to climb over six Iawyers to get to you, Mr. Petrelli. Are you okay? My head feels Iike it's going to split open. Help yourself. I didn't kill that girl. We know. The blood found on you was your own. We checked you out and you don't seem to have any injuries. Care to explain that? If I'm not being charged can I go? What's a hospice nurse from Manhattan doing at a high school homecoming in Texas? You some kind of pervert? My brother said not to talk. We don't need you to talk. (VOICES MURMURING) PETER: We needed to save the cheerleader. What are you doing to me? Save the cheerleader. AUDREY: Too late for that, Matt. The cheerleader is dead. CIaire's dead? No, that's not possible. MATT: Did he just read her mind? Is he one of them? The cheerleader's name was Jackie Wilcox. What the hell is going on here? No, CIaire is the one that he wanted. CIaire? What, you're not protecting her? Why would you know who he wanted? You want to catch this guy? You need to find her. You need to protect her. He's telling the truth. We better find this cheerleader. You're not going to Iet me out of here? You get out when I get answers. I faxed the Iist to your Quantico office yesterday. Names, addresses. Why haven't you warned them? Looking into it? At Ieast six of the people on this Iist are dead, all of them from the same killer. James Walker in Los Angeles was killed nine days ago. Charlene Andrews, two days ago, Midland, Texas. Doesn't this mean anything to you people? Well, do you really want to take that chance? Fine, I won't. Never mind. You're sketching. I am. And you're sober. The Iocks on the door helped. Anything interesting? Nothing predictive if that's what you're asking. I don't think I can do it clean. You'II get there. To be honest, it's nice to be drawing just to draw again. That's what I Iiked about comics. You don't have to take them too seriously. Good guys catching bad guys? Which reminds me, CIaire, the cheerleader, she's alive. Peter, he saved her. No, you did. With your gift. I mean, thanks to you Sylar won't be able to hurt anybody anymore. This means we can change the future, maybe stop that bomb. Well, I wish you the best of Iuck. What? Where are you going? Off the reservation. You're Ieaving? What...what good is painting the future if no one will do anything to change it? So, change it. (SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Hiro? Hiro Nakamura? Yes? This is Isaac Mendez. Mr. Isaac? Hiro, we need to meet. ...and then he grabbed her. I tried to save her but he was killing her. She told me to run so I ran. I Ieft her, and I ran. AUDREY: I'm sorry, Claire. I know you've been through a lot. I just have a few more questions. This man, did he exhibit anything out of the ordinary? You mean besides killing my friend? No, like being able to fall five stories and walk away without a scratch. What? Well, you said Peter Petrelli tackled the man who killed Jackie and they both fell over the Iedge. That's a pretty Iong fall. Is Peter okay? He survived without a scratch. How do you think he did that? AII I know is he saved my Iife. Well, he's a very Iucky guy. You didn't seem to get hurt at all either. I guess I'm Iucky, too. We found some of your blood at the crime scene. Look, I've told you everything I know, okay? Do you have what you need, Agent Hanson? Yes. Of course. Thank you both very much for your time. Wait. Can I talk to Peter? Excuse me. Yes. Mr. Bennet, I just want to Iet you know we're doing everything in our power to... To get this guy. Well, I appreciate that Mr... Parkman. Officer Matt Parkman. I really appreciate that, Officer Parkman. Thank You. (ELEVATOR DINGS) (SIGHS) You don't have to be a mind reader to know she's hiding something. What is it? I didn't get anything. I mean I... There was this distinct absence of sound. You mean silence? No, it was more Iike a static interfering with my... Whatever the hell this thing is. Well, that's a new one. No it's not. Actually, I've heard this before. Once when I went to that bar, it's the Iast thing that I heard or didn't hear before I Iost a day. D.L. Did she... Did I... Get up. What did you do? What I had to do to get Micah back. If you cared about Micah you wouldn't have taken those shots. You could have missed. I don't miss. You saw D.L.'s jacket. D.L.'s Micah's father. D.L. is a criminal. He brought danger into our home. You want Micah to end up Iike that? You're wrong about him. You're out of control. What do you know about control, Niki? You're a part of me. You do what I say. It doesn't work Iike that, not anymore. Why are you doing this? Because you're not strong enough. MICAH: Mom! Micah? Mom, is that you? I'm coming. You're okay. Thanks to you. Mr. Petrelli, I'm CIaire's father. Hi. You saved my Iittle girl. I owe you my Iife. I was just in the right place. Maybe one day I'II be in the right place and can return the favor. (COUGHING) Are you feeling all right? Yeah. I'm fine. Hey, Dad, can you wait outside? Of course. How Iong have you known? Known what? That you're Iike me. You would have died if you couldn't... Wait, wait, wait. Do you... Do you heal? Is that it? AII this time I thought it was just me. Now there's you? Is that why you came for me? Is that why you asked me if I was the one? No, I just... I knew I had to save you. Why? To save the world. What do I have to do with the world? I don't know yet. I do know that I don't think I would be here if it wasn't for you. I... I think I died. I've died before. It's no big deal. I'm not Iike you, CIaire. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) It's, uh... This healing thing is kind of new for me. What, you didn't know that you were going to heal when you dove off the building? No. It's kind of stupid, huh? No, it's not. You're totally my hero. Micah? MICAH: Mom? Mom, is that you? Mom. Dad's hurt. Where is he? In there. He's bleeding, bad. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. It's for your own good! (EXCLAIMING) Micah! Micah! Are you okay, son? Oh, my God! Stay away from him. It's me, baby. Mom, is that you? It's me. I am so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey. Hey. So, what have people been saying? Well, the official word is that somebody got killed in the high school, but everybody knows it's Jackie. I got Iike four text messages this morning. Did you bring the tapes? Yeah. It wasn't that much to... That's pretty destroyed, right? Yeah, I don't think they're gonna play again. Look, I feel really bad about breaking you out and pushing you to go to homecoming Iast night. I'm sorry. You shouldn't feel bad. You did it because you're my friend. Probably the best friend I ever had. You know, I've only been your friend for two weeks. Hey, I didn't say it wasn't pathetic. You know you could've been killed. I know. Look, I've got to go. My dad just wanted to make sure you weren't going to say anything to anyone. Of course. Cross my heart. Thanks, Zach. Hiro Nakamura, I presume. Mr. Isaac? This hasn't even gone to the printer yet. It's... It's incredible. You really went to the future. Jumping through time, I mean. And space. Your power very strong, too. I'm not so sure about that. I can only do it when I'm chasing. Stoned, on drugs. What else did you see there? Then? Oh, I saw the bomb. It exploded the city and destroyed many things. And I saw you... What about me? I saw on the floor. You were dead, with your head cut off. Okay. The man who cuts off heads, he's taken care of. He's caught? This is very good news. Hiro Iost a friend. The brain man killed her. Wait a minute. I painted this two days ago, sober. Is this your friend? HIRO: Yes. I did it. You say your mission is to stop the bomb in New York. Yes. Our destiny. I think it may be mine, too. I painted that mural on my floor. And very recently I painted a picture of a man exploding. How do you stop an exploding man? Mom? Dad? Mom's at the store. I don't know where Dad is. Did dad talk to you? About what? About me. He knows, and he knows that you know. My thing? That I can't get hurt. That didn't hurt? Lyle, I'm serious. Now, tell me what Dad said to you. I haven't seen Dad all day. But he was supposed to pick you up from practice. Well, he didn't. Well, how'd you get home? Lyle, how did you get home? I... I don't remember. We can get you some help, Nik. You don't understand. There are doctors that can help with situations Iike this. D, she's stronger than me. I don't believe that for a second. But you've seen what she can do. How do explain that? There are a Iot of things that I can't explain. Like why you shot me. Jessica shot you. She's gonna come back and take Micah. She's out of control. She could really hurt him. Even... I can't be trusted. Nik... Micah? You all right? Yeah, I'm... I'm okay. Come on. We'II get you to a hotel. We're gonna get you cleaned up, all right? Nik, we're gonna go to a hotel. Nik? Can I help you, ma'am? Yeah, you can arrest me. Arrest you? For what? Murder. AUDREY: Really, Parkman? Since when does absence of noise warrant a stakeout? You always say I don't take you anywhere. Well, you sure know how to spoil a girl. Eat your Tex-Mex. AUDREY: I gotta say, he can be cute. Oh, God, did he just hear that? Did you just read my mind? You can't do that. It was a stray thought. I... You can't do that. You really think I'm cute? I really think you're married. And I really think you Iove your wife. I do. Then why haven't you called to yell at her so you can go home already? That's what you want, isn't it? I don't want to be a chump. So, still Ioving your wife after she has sex with someone else makes you a chump. Doesn't it? Grow up, Parkman. If you want your marriage to work, you have to find a way to make it work. Otherwise you are kind of a chump. Cheerleader's dad, nine o'clock. That guy who's with him, I know that guy. From where? He was at the bar. The night I first heard that static. What? How do you know? I thought you Iost that whole day. Matt, maybe we should get out of here. Hold on, I'm just trying to get something. (PANTING) I was only able to get one word. What? Sylar. AII right, CIaire, I'm here. What's the emergency? Something's going on. It's Iike the Stepford Body Snatchers or something. My brother doesn't remember anything. What I can do, nothing. It's Iike they made him forget. AII right, so this is another one of your Iittle cheerleader initiation pranks, is that it? Hmm? Is it? Zach, are you Iistening to me? Something is going on. What is your damage? Look, you haven't talked to me since sixth grade, and now you call me out of the blue. What is this about? They got you, too. Are you on crystal meth or something, because this is really cracky behavior. CIaire? You see yourself as some sort of humanitarian, don't you? A do-gooder, a hero kidnapping men and women who are different. Does that make you feel powerful? We're quite alike, you know. You collect special people. So do I. We're going to take you apart, Gabriel, Iike one of your Iittle watches. Sorry, time pieces. And we're gonna find out exactly what makes you tick. I don't think I can do this. Yes, you can. Concentrate. (SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hello? Tell me you remember. You... You... You remember what I told you Iast night, don't you? You remember what we talked about? Of course I do. What's going on? You said there were people who wanted to hurt me. I think they got to Zach and Lyle. They don't remember anything. It's Iike it never happened. I don't know what to do. Where are you? I'm at home. Where's Mom? Where's... Where's Lyle? Just stay where you are. I'II be right there. I Iove you, CIaire. You're gonna be okay. Okay. (GASPS) No! (SCREAMING) I work for your father. He sent me here to make you forget, Iike he sent me to your friend and to your brother and to your mother so many times. He'II be here soon expecting that you won't remember anything. But it is very important that you do. Tell me, CIaire. Can you keep a secret? (SPEAKING IN JAPANESE) (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hello? EDEN: Mohinder? It's me. Eden? Look, I'm not who you think I am. I lied to you, and I'm really sorry, and I'm going to explain it all to you soon. Where are you? What's going on? First I need to make things right. Starting with killing the man who murdered your father. (PHONE CLICKS) Eden, wait. I... I do know you, don't I? I Iived next door to Chandra Suresh. That wonderful ability. The power of persuasion, and this whole time you were the girl next door? I'm gonna take this gun, and I'm gonna put it in that slot, and you're gonna take it and you're gonna blow your brains out. You knew, didn't you? You knew what I was and you Iet it continue. In a way, you helped me. And after I've consumed your power you'II help me even more. Oh, Eden, you know that won't hurt me. (GUN FIRES) What are you doing here, Nathan? Let's go. Aren't you gonna ask what happened? I know what happened. You got yourself in trouble. You nearly got yourself killed. No, no, no, I saved a girl. Had to be a hero, didn't you? Get it out of your system now? I finally get it now, Nathan. I have these dreams, and when I'm around with someone with an ability I can do what they can do. You Iook Iike hell. And I was with that girl. And that guy that was trying to kill that girl, and this cop, I think he was reading my mind. They were all Iike us. Dysfunctional? No, they... Nathan I have to stop that bomb. I have to save everybody. Right now I'd settle for you walking straight. Peter? Pete? (VOICES MURMURING) (SCREAMING) Easy. Easy. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. It's all my fault. The explosion. What are you talking about? It's me. Breathe. Come on, Peter. Breathe. Peter! Peter! Peter!
