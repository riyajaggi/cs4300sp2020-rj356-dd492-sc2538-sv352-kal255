 NARRATOR: Previously on Heroes. What the hell did you do to me? I could ask you the same thing. NIKI: All I know is that I woke up in your room somehow and you were gone. They blackmailed me just Iike they're gonna blackmail you. For a man whose campaign is founded on sound family values, this could be really embarrassing for you, especially considering your wife. Two million dollars makes me a candidate in your pocket. Four million makes me a congressman. (BONES CRACKING)

 It's about the videotape. The tape where you're, Iike, killing yourself Iike 20 times. That was attempt number six. It was in my backpack, and now it's not. What? It's gone. What do you mean, it's gone? CLAIRE: We have got to find that tape. Dad, how did you get out of jail? I walked out because I got a secret. MICAH: Mom has a secret, too. What do you think D.L. is gonna do when he finds out what we've done? What we've done? We framed him. I'm taking Micah, and I'm taking the money.

 You're not taking anything. (GRUNTING) Mom! Everything we say, everything you see, by tomorrow it won't matter. What, a guy can't cook dinner for his wife without being accused of cheating on her? Well, you were missing for a day and now this. I Iove you. It's Iike you're in my head. There's a piece about that size. I painted it weeks ago. Simone has it. What was it of? I don't remember. I was high. Then we need to get it back. Tell her a guy from the future said you needed it. Now AmCor is holding steady but Yamagato... Yamagato is down to 215 and an eighth. I think that's a good bargain. Really? And what do you know? You saying I couldn't pick a stock? Darwinian. Look at your sorry ass, barely able to make minimum wage. Now, you Iook at me Iiving in a penthouse on Central Park West. Correction. It's dying in a penthouse on Central Park West. (CHARLES COUGHING) (LAUGHING) Right you are, my boy. Right you are. Teach you to mess with me. Take a breath. In the end, all that matters is Iove. I Iove you, Peter. I Iove you, too, Charles. You speak your mind. You know who you are, you know what you want. That's your power. That's your strength. Mind if I Iet you in on a Iittle secret, Charles? You can say anything to me. You know that. I can fly. (LAUGHING) Really? Well, if you can fly then show me. AII right. Watch this. (DOORBELL BUZZING) Simone? What's wrong? Come in. It's my dad. That's so weird. I was just having a dream about him. He passed away about an hour ago. (SOBBING) I really needed to see you. (DOORBELL RINGING) You know, I get that you're sort of socially slow, but you know you're supposed to call someone before you come over. This you're gonna want to hear right away. I found the tape. What tape? The tape of you trying to kill yourself 20 times. I found it. Look, I was Iooking for my PSP under my bed, right? And there it was. Look. You're safe. I thought this was supposed to be good news. Well, I can't believe you had this entire time. Why didn't you Iook there before? I did. I tore the whole room apart. I must have checked the bed Iike 50 times. Morning, Mrs. Bennet. Morning, dog. How are you, Zachary? I'm all right. CIaire keeps punching me, though. SANDRA: Your dad's plane is going to be Iate. I won't be home till 8:00 or so. I am trusting you to hold down the fort. Because Lyle never Iistens to me. Well, he will Iisten to you today 'cause he knows what a big day it is for Mr. Muggles. Thank you. And he doesn't want to stress us out. (EXCLAIMS) Does he? Sure. Will you two help me out to the car? Your dad Ieft on the sprinklers Iast night, and I don't want to get his paws all soggy. Take this. Here we go. Wish Mr. Muggles good Iuck. (SIGHS) (GASPS) Micah? Micah? Micah! (PANTING) Help me. Now, things have been really good between us these Iast couple of days, don't you think? I know. I Iike it. I just... I feel Iike we've been really honest with each other. And that's good, right? Yeah. There's something that we need to talk about, something that I've discovered. JANICE: I thought I'd been so careful. Well, what? What is it? I don't... JANICE: Oh, God, he knows. What? What did you want to say? It can wait, actually. I gotta... Gotta get to work. Matt? (KNOCKING ON DOOR) (DOOR OPENING) TINA: Niki? I was knocking Iike forever. What is it? Micah. D.L. came back. He took him. I tried to protect my son, but I couldn't. I failed him. Landlord said Isaac's gone, that he took his paintings and... Did you know he was Ieaving? No. I can't believe he would just go Iike that, no... Not when we were just starting to make sense of his paintings. I wanted to tell him what happened in person. Isaac sketched it for my dad's 70th birthday. You know, I've been trying to get him clean forever. The one time I need him... Feels Iike everybody's Ieaving me. I'm not going anywhere. He was still in a coma, and then, Iike it was any other day, he started talking. He said he'd been flying all over the world, but that is was a world he didn't recognize. There were so many people filled with pain. Nobody Iooking out for each other. He worried for them, and for me, until you told him everything would be okay. What do you mean, I told him? I know, it doesn't make any sense, but he said that you were flying with him, and you told him it was all going to be okay, that there were people who cared, who would make a difference. That you would save the world. After that, he just put his head down and he was gone. Like he was falling asleep. I never had that conversation with your father. But it sounds Iike something you would say. Those messages you Ieft on my answering machine. You said you wanted one of Isaac's paintings because it would help you save the world. It's hard to explain. But if you had that painting... I could save the world. Linderman. What? The painting you want, I sold it to a guy named Linderman. He Iives in Las Vegas. ANGELA: Linderman gave you four million dollars, and you're spending it on postcards. I take it I'm supposed to choose. Mmm. That one. Oh, if that isn't a red flag, you two agreeing on something. AII right, I'm gonna go to the office and have this printed out. Don't you want hear about how The New York Journal wants to do a cover story on you? I've invited OIiver Dennison to come for family brunch and do an interview. You're kidding. No, I never kid about family brunch. That's because we never have family brunch. Nathan, this could be great. I don't know. Dennison could go anywhere for a bagel. If he comes here, he's gonna want something. Nothing wrong with taking advantage of an opportunity. Mandy? Kids, why don't you go finish that train set we started this morning, all right? Come on. Take them upstairs. I am not going to use my family for political gain. Tell that to Peter. Nathan, you've been trying to protect me since this happened. And it's sweet in theory, but in practice, it's insulting. I'm not made of glass. I know. But we don't need this. Four points behind says we do. Now, I've been hiding in this house for the Iast six months because your polling was afraid I'd make you Iook weak. But now I can help by coming forward. Let me. You sure about this? Set it up. Chef's been cooking all morning. OIiver will be here in an hour. Then I better get ready. Yeah. Good idea. You feeling okay, man? Hey, Tommy, yeah. I'm good. Come on, buddy, we rode in the same car together for three years. Practically read your mind. Dude, I don't know where to start. Well, how about we go get a beer? There's a Dodger game at 7:00. Yeah. Yeah, I'd Iike that. Thanks. (MEN CATCALLING) What's going on? What are you doing here? It's Sylar. He's killed again. I'II brief you on the way to the morgue. Sylar? Who's Sylar? I got to talk to my watch commander. Taken care of. I'II be outside. Put on some real-person clothes. Lyle, you better not think I'm cleaning up after you. We just got rid of all those ants. Such a dork. ZACH: So unreal. CLAIRE: Okay, I'm good. (SCREAMING) ZACH: Oh, my. Oh, my God. What are you doing? Oh, my God, Claire! Shut it off. Lyle, give it to me! Give it to me! ZACH: Claire! (BEEPS) It's amazing what you can do with special effects these days, huh? That was all special effects? Yeah, what else would it be? Ow! What the hell is wrong with you? CLAIRE: Lyle, give it to me! Now! Get back here! Zach, don't Iet him get away! Lyle! You okay? Lyle! Get back here! Hey! (GRUNTING) Why would you want to kill him again? Because he found the tape and then he stapled me. Help! Somebody help me! My sister's a freak! AUDREY: We found him in a parking Iot in Brentwood. Name's Robert Fresco, an oncologist at UCLA Medical Center. Okay, so we figure out the M.O. Well, the M.O. is there is no M.O. Sylar's victims are random. Eight deaths I have no clue how to explain. Trust me, this one's number nine. Yeah, but there's nothing out of the ordinary here, right? Doesn't this guy Iook Iike any other burn victim? He's putting out 1800 curies of radiation. Whoa. HAZMAT team scoured the scene, but didn't find any incendiaries. No plutonium, no uranium, nothing. They did, however, find a fingerprint seared to the bone Iike a brand. Seared to the bone? We're running it through CODIS. Now, if we get a match and we can get close to him, I'm gonna need you to get inside his head. Pick him out of a crowd, find him in a building... Right. About that. Lately it's been harder for me to filter the voices, and hearing what they're really thinking, it can be ugly. What's going on, Matt? (COMPUTER BEEPING) Theodore Sprague, a.k.a. Sylar. We got you. So, you just going to sit there all day and not say a word, huh? I want to go home. Like I told you, it's not safe there with your mother. Is she dead? No. She's gonna be fine. How do you know? Dad, we Ieft her on the floor. We didn't have a choice. Heroes don't run away. Micah... Bad guys do. Heroes help people, Dad. You know what? You're a bad guy. I'm not a bad guy, all right? Do you remember when I told you that six months ago I started having these bad dreams? We all have bad dreams, Niki. I don't think that they were just dreams. When it started, I thought that maybe somebody was following me or something. And I would catch my reflection and... But it wasn't my reflection. It was another me. She has a name. Jessica. Jessica? When someone tries to hurt me, it's Iike she comes out. There is no Jessica. It's just you. No, I see her in the mirror, and she tells me that she wants to come out again. And the part of me that needs Micah back wants to Iet her do it. It's just complicated with your mom and me. What's up ahead? Stay there. Dad, don't! Sit down! Wait! (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Lady! You gotta get up! You gotta get out of there. You no worry. I help. Dad! Hiro! (SPEAKING JAPANESE) Dad! D.L: Micah! Dad, I thought you were dead. What happened? I don't know. We're usually in our pajamas around the breakfast table. You can't blame us for cleaning up for The Journal. Not when the hollandaise is made fresh. You seem to be adjusting well. To the wheelchair? You can say it, Mr. Dennison. I Iost my right to be sensitive when I married Nathan. I'm not saying I didn't have my darker moments during rehabilitation. I was angry for a Iong time. At your husband. Wasn't he driving? At God. But we seem to have made our peace. Oh, hello, Peter. What's this? It's brunch. We always have brunch. Since when? Will you excuse me? Peter, how good to see you. Nice of you to drop by, Peter. Whatever this is about, now is not the time. Charles Deveaux died this morning. Yeah. I'm sorry. Were you there? No, I wasn't. I stopped working for him so I could figure out what was going on with us. Yeah, I told you to drop all this "I'm special" crap. I can't, all right? I need your help. That man out there is OIiver Dennison. He's working for The Journal, doing a story on me. Everything I've worked for is riding on our family being able to sit through a single meal together and smile. So I'm not family enough for you now. No, you're not. Not when you're going to ruin an election for me. I just... I need you to get me a painting, all right? Linderman bought it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not exactly advertising that family connection around here. AII right, great. So just get him on the phone and ask about the painting. Pete, I'm sorry. But you're gonna have to go, okay? Hey, you know what? I'm just gonna fly off the terrace, yeah? No? Hey, I can fly. Nathan, so can you. Tell you what. Why don't we just race around the Statue of Liberty real quick, huh? Get this tweedy guy something to write about. You wouldn't. Huh? Peter! Peter. Sorry, Nathan gave me an earful about showing up in cords. Told him I'm trying to stay grounded. Good to have you back. How'd you get this? The issue isn't even out yet. (SPEAKING JAPANESE) See? AII the same. Hiro, Ando... Even same car! Nissan Versa! I teleported. New York City. (EXCLAIMING) I freeze time, too. Stop the explosion. Saved your dad. Hey, didn't you visit my mom? Hmm? We should get them to a hospital. Can you drive? Don't worry. Help is coming. I called the police. Time to go, Micah. Dad, you saved her Iike a real hero. Now we can go back and save Mom. I wish it were that easy. Well, it is, Dad. We just go back. No, Micah, it's not. I'm sorry. We can't go back. We can never go back. Come on. Bye-bye. Take care. (POLICE SIREN WAILING) Come on! You can't stay in there forever! Would you just give me the damn tape? I'm gonna put this thing on YouTube, make Iike a million bucks. YouTube is free, you idiot. You're not helping. Lyle, no one can see what's on that tape. Are you an alien or something? Is he an alien, too? Yeah, yeah, we're gonna anal probe you. Zach, stop scaring him. I'm not coming out until Mom and Dad get home. No. No, no, no, no. You cannot tell them. Lyle, please, they cannot find out about this. Why not? Don't you get it? If they found out, Mom and Dad would think it was a mistake to ever adopt me. We wouldn't be a family anymore. PIease. Thank you. Whatever. (YELLS) Wait a minute, wait a second. We're going in here without backup? No on even knows we're here, do they? What is this all about with you? You in my head, Parkman? No, I'm just... I'm asking a question. It's about Sylar. I'm not Ietting him get away this time. I'm taking him down. Something's burning. Radiation? AUDREY: Curie Ievels are safe. (GEIGER COUNTER CLICKING) MATT: What the hell is this? What? AUDREY: Hang on, I'm getting some spikes. Hey. Check this out. Their faces are all burned off. (THUDDING) (GEIGER COUNTER CLICKING RAPIDLY) What the hell happened in here? Eighteen hundred curies of radiation. Come on, Iet's get out of here. Of course I'm gonna vote for Nathan. Yep. If Nathan takes care of the people half as much as he takes care of his brother, it's gonna be an interesting city. Pretty special family. You have no idea. DENNISON: This is all very inspiring. I was surprised to Iearn the Linderman group recently invested in your campaign. I don't know why you'd be surprised. Mr. Linderman was a good friend of my father's. So, you don't deny going to Las Vegas to meet with a reputed mobster? Is that why you're here? I spoke with a former member of your security detail. It seems there was a bit of a scare, that you disappeared from the casino for several hours, and there was a blond involved. It's all right, Nathan. You can tell him. Right... I'm sure you've recently heard about my mental health issues. I quit my job because of it. My brother basically saved my Iife, and he's convinced me to get the help that I needed. There's a private clinic outside Vegas. Nathan went, spoke to a doctor, a woman doctor. I made him promise that no one would know. Not even the family, but I just don't care who knows anymore. Okay? I didn't want to say anything until I'd cleared it with you. That's Nathan. You know, right in the middle of an election he still has time to help out his messed up Iittle brother. Oh, well... What's this? They counteract the radiation poisoning. Oh, thanks. (CELL PHONE RINGING) One second. Who keeps calling you? Nobody, it's my wife. Since when is your wife nobody? Listen, I don't think this guy's Sylar. Yeah? Well, we'II see. Look what I found in bedroom. Look at this. Methotrexate. This is chemotherapy in a pill. This is prescribed to Karen Sprague and it's current. She has cancer? Check out the doctor on the Iabel. Dr. Robert Fresco. Right. The oncologist. Mmm-hmm. Karen Sprague's room? (WOMAN CHATTERING ON PA) (ECG BEEPING) Take it easy, Ted. We just want to ask you some questions. I didn't mean to kill him. Dr. Fresco said there was nothing he could do to save her. I tried to convince him, you know. There must be something else that he could do. Anything. Then we argued, and I Iost control. We can talk about this downtown. Hey, Iet her go! If you Iet me stay with my wife. No, you Iet her go or I shoot. Do you have any idea what would happen if you did that? Because I don't. Maybe I'II explode. Maybe I'II take out this whole hospital. Maybe I'II wipe out this city Iike an atomic bomb. Just Ieave me alone! We can't do that. KAREN: Stop, Ted, stop. Karen wants you to stop. How could you say that? She says you need to Iisten, Ted. You never Iisten. You're too damn stubborn, but you're still her Teddy Bear. Wait a minute, you can hear her? He's telling the truth, Ted. Listen to him. (NURSE GROANING) What's she saying? She's saying she... She doesn't blame you for all the pain and the worry. She's saying it's not your fault, Ted. She shouldn't be here. It's not fair. MATT: She's saying it never is. She said that was the best date. The picnic on the beach and it poured sheets and sheets of rain. We sat in my car and Iistened to the whole American Beauty album. She remembers it all. She always will. (SOBBING) What's she saying now? Hi, this is Niki Sanders from Las Vegas. I need your help. I know that I'm probably the last person that you want to talk to. You should not have called me here. I know that I have no right to, but I need your help. My husband took my son. I have nowhere else to go. I'm sorry. I can't help you. You have the wrong number. Hi, hon. Where are the boys? In the playroom. Do you still Iove me, Nathan? Of course, I do. I know what this chair means to us as a couple. But I need you to know that I'm going to walk again. The doctors say it's a Iong shot, but I can do it if I have a reason. We just need some hope, Nathan, that our Iife can be Iike it was. What Peter said, about you checking out a clinic for him with a doctor, tell me that's what happened. If you say it is, I'II believe you. Just give me some hope. It's true. Come on. I'm gonna get the kids ready for bed. Okay. What the hell happened? You should just go. Niki, what's going on here? Are you okay? I said that you can go now. It's me. I'm just trying to help you out, girl, okay? She doesn't need your help anymore. Understand? Hey. Hey. So, they're gonna run Sprague through decontamination, then put him in a special holding tank downtown. How'd he cause all that damage with his bare hands? How do you hear what people are thinking? You did a great job in there. Well, Iook, the guy was Iosing his wife. He just wanted to talk to her, say goodbye. You talk to your own wife yet? You've been dodging her call all day. Well, I'm gonna head downtown, cover Sprague's processing. Right. (CELL PHONE DIALING) Hey, it's me. I actually thought you might be home by now. I'm calling just to talk. Look, I had this stupid idea in my head that I'm losing you. And I... I just... I can't help but have the feeling that there's something you're not telling me. And I don't want us to live with any regret or blame. I don't know. I guess I'm just afraid of things going unsaid. I Iove you, and I just wanted to tell you that. You don't have to call me back. I'II see you Iater tonight. Yes, Mr. Linderman. It seems my brother has developed some sort of emotional attachment to this painting. I don't know what will happen to him if he doesn't get it, but I'd rather not find out. Directly to the gallery. Mr. Linderman, I appreciate it. Good night. (DOORBELL BUZZING) You need to tell Heidi the truth. No. She doesn't need the truth. She needs hope. What's that, some kind of excuse? I'm not saying what I did was right. That girl in Vegas, I just needed to be with someone who didn't make me feel guilty every time I Iooked at her. Did you talk to Linderman? Yeah. Sit down. And? He's not gonna Iet it go. Hey, come on, Pete, just Iet it go. It's just a painting. It's more than that, Nathan. This is about what's going on with us. AII right? This painting is the key. AII right, with this thing, we could make a difference. I'm trying to make a difference, Peter, the best way I know how. FIying around, how's that going to help anybody? What is that... I can't... What am I gonna do when I get there? I don't have a gun. I don't have a badge. I don't know karate. I guess I could put on a costume and fly around and pull cats out of trees. How's that gonna make a difference? You're not gonna know until you try. I'm sorry about the painting. Listen, something else happened in Vegas that I... What? These two guys, they tired to pull me out of my hotel room. They did. It was Iike a kidnapping attempt or something. How'd you get away? I flew. So, who were they? I mean... The one who did all the talking had these horn-rimmed glasses. The other guy was a spooky Euro dude. He didn't say a word. Son of a bitch. You really expect me to believe that? Yeah. I'm not Iying to you. No? No. Think about it. What would people do if they knew what we were capable of? They'd Iock us up and they'd throw away the key. I know it sounds crazy. Be careful. Yeah. Someone had a good day. It's all over the station. FBI bust, Homeland Security collar. Congrats, buddy. Thanks, man. It really wasn't anything, though. It must have been something. Your FBI girlfriend just put in a request for you to retake the detective's exam as a series of interviews. Can't blame it on the dyslexia this time. Wait a second. Interviews? I didn't even know that was an option. She's FBI. She pulled some strings. And you are going to pass it, no problem. Thanks, man. Wow. TOM: Loser. I'm nailing your wife and she is so fine. So fine! (LAUGHING) Hey, still want to grab that drink? (GROANS) MATT: Son of a bitch! MOHINDER: You do not choose your destiny. It chooses you. And those who knew you before fate took you by the hand cannot understand the depth of the changes inside. (DIAL TONE DRONING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yeah? Mom. Micah. Hey, baby, I've been worried. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Are you? I'm good. Are you with your dad right now? Yeah, I just got out for one minute. Mom, is this really you? Tell me where you are, baby. Just put my mom on the phone. Your mom's not here right now. And she's not coming back until I take care of a few things. So, why don't you tell me where you are, I'II come get you and bring you home. Your mom needs you. I'm in a Iittle motel. It's right off the Interstate 14. It's called the Little Field Motel. You talking to your mom? No. No, I'm just goofing around. Come on. We've got some driving to do. MOHINDER: They cannot fathom how much you stand to lose in failure. Micah? That you are the instrument of a flawless design, and all of life may hang in the balance. The hero learns quickly who can comprehend, and who merely stands in your way.
