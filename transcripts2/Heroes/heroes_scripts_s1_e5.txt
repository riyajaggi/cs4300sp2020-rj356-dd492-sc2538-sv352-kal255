 Previously on Heroes. So, is that the quarterback? Who? The boy that you like right over there. This is going to happen. No! Please! There's nothing you can do about it. I can do this. I was at a bar. I had a beer. Everything we say, everything you see, by tomorrow it won't matter. Go deep, then clean him out. So here we are, not knowing how we feel about each other,

 and this entire city is going to go... I can save you, Simone. You think you can save us all by shooting up? I can save everybody. Goodbye, Isaac. Full house! I win again! I had three aces at that poker table. Next thing I know, you two had them. It's your job to be nervous, it's my job to get elected. There's a man arriving this afternoon from New York. In order to do that I need money. Linderman's two million we can turn eight points into three and make it a horse race. A politician who wants some help from Mr. Linderman.

 I'm not a whore. Just take the one. When a change comes some species feel the urge to migrate. They call it "Zugunruhe", a pull of the soul to a far off place, following a scent in the wind, a star in the sky. The ancient message comes calling the kindred to take flight and gather together. Only then can they hope to survive the cruel season to come. Peter Petrelli? What? Are you doing this? You look different without the scar. I don't know you. Not yet. My name is Hiro Nakamura. I'm from the future, and I have a message for you. I don't have much time. I'm risking a rift just by coming here. The girl, you have to save her. What girl? The cheerleader. It's the only way to prevent it. Prevent what? Everything. Listen to me. She must live. The painter, Isaac, go to him. He will know. When I call you, you must tell me where we meet. You told me many times how lost you felt before it all started. This is what you've been waiting for. Be the one we need. Wait. Save the cheerleader, save the world. Wait, Hiro, I don't understand. Hiro, where are you? I don't understand. Peter, are you alright? The cheerleader. Dr. Gordon to the O. R. She's got an airway. She's breathing. She's got circulation. I'm fine. I just want to go home. Looks like she was driving. There was a lot of blood in her mouth. I don't see anything. Is the mother here? Claire? Mom. Oh, God, is she okay? Your daughter's going to be fine. Does it hurt? They said you're going to be okay. No. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. I just want to go home. Soon, sweetie. The doctors just want to run some tests first. I'll call your father, and tell him to come. Crazy bitch. Dr. Wilks to radiation. Dr. Wilks... Do you have any idea who I am? Better than even you do. All right, look, I'll pay you. Okay? You name it. We don't want anything. We just need to know a couple of things. That's all. That was entirely unnecessary. You might as well go ahead and shoot now, because I'll find you, and I will kill you. Unlikely, Mr. Petrelli. I've seen your faces. That I'm afraid won't be a problem. Put him down. Where is he? What did you do with Mr. Petrelli? Who? The guy you slept with, where is he? I don't know. I don't even know how I got here. I have to call my son. Don't even think about it. Get dressed. You're coming with us. Leave the lady alone. If you have a problem it's with me. You have a congressional candidate missing from your hotel. My team's working on it now. If you'd like to review the security tapes with us you can come with me. Fine. Let's go. Admirable work, Miss Sanders. Feel free to go home, secure in your solvency. What did you do to me? As I saw it a lot of things were done to you. However, none of them by me. No. I left. I didn't go through with it. Mr. Linderman reviewed the tape, and needless to say, was quite pleased with your performance. Either that's you or you still owe Mr. Linderman $50,000. Go home to your son, Miss Sanders. And tell him his mommy doesn't have to worry about people asking for their money anymore. He was right there. But then he teleported away? He stopped time somehow. He talked to me. He knew who I was. He says that we all meet up somehow, sometime in the future I guess. It seems crazy, but I know what I saw. He said something bad is going to happen, but we can stop it. First we have to... Save a cheerleader. A cheerleader? Look, it seems impossible, I know. Impossible? It sounds mad. Please, just... He said I have to go back to see Isaac the painter. Okay? That he's going to know what we have to do. So, let's just go back to his loft. All right, if the answer isn't there I promise that I will drive you to the airport myself. You can go back to India and you never have to hear from me again. Will you fly me there yourself? There are no answers. Go home, Peter. Someone there has to be able to do something to find him. No, he went out on assignment, and he hasn't checked in since. I... Look, will you just have Detective McHenry call me? Never mind. He's home. Hey. Where the hell have you been? Do you know how worried I was? I must have drank too much and passed out on the couch. Do we have any aspirin? You have been gone for a day. What? That's impossible. No, it isn't. Trust me. I've been awake for every hour of it. I called the precinct a dozen times and they said you were working with the FBI. Yeah. I just started. I was going to tell you about that, but... But what? Where were you? I was... I don't know. You don't know? Do you have any idea what I've just been through? I kept picturing you in a ditch somewhere. And then every time the phone would ring I'd think it was somebody calling to tell me that... I didn't know you cared that much. I am your wife. I always care. I mean, it's good that you do, but you've barely spoken to me lately except in our therapy sessions, Janice. What if something had happened to you? You worried about me. That's a good thing. You bastards! You don't know who you're messing with! Oh, waffles! Yoo-hoo! Hey, look at that. All right, I get it. A guy in his pajamas. Ha, ha. Now, we can all stare and have a good laugh or one of you can lend me your cell phone. Can I help you? I'll take one of those t-shirts and a cup of coffee while you're at it. ...two porterhouse steaks, both medium rare and... What sides do you have? You know, one of everything is great. Cool. Thank you. Bye. Why aren't you at work? You've been... You've been sleeping next to me all this time, and I... I miss you. And I know... I know you think I'm lazy and that I don't know how to listen. And that all I do is mope. You know what? That's okay. Maybe you're right. Maybe I just need to try harder. I think we both do. Good, because we're calling in sick today. No. Oh, yeah. No. I've got it all planned out, just go get dressed. I'm dressed. No, something nicer. Come on. Hey! How are you doing? Can I help you? Hiro. Hiro Nakamura. Oh, Nathan Petrelli. Petrelli, listen. Very nice to meet you... Thank you. ...flying man. Oh, you fly. I see you. Thank you. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, it's okay. I keep secret. I bend time and space. Teleported into future. We are both special. All righty, then. Oh, I go to New York. I see future. Big bomb goes there. Bad for many people. I can see where that might be a problem. Oh, don't worry. I stop it. I'm Hiro. Lucky us. Got to go. In this future that you see, you don't happen to know whether or not I win the election, do you? Nathan Petrelli... Yes, I know you. Nathan Petrelli. Election. You win. Very big win. Landslide. I've to get back to Vegas. Give me ride, please. Hmm? A ride. Sure. Well, what the hell. What did you say your name was? Hiro Nakamura. Where are you from? Tokyo, Japan. Never been there. Hi. Your mother told me you lost control of the car. That's what I told her happened. Is there something you want to tell me? I ran the car into the wall on purpose. You could've killed yourself. I wasn't thinking about me. Well, what were you thinking about? Claire, you've got to start trusting me. I lied to you. About what? I lied to you when I said... I lied to you when I said nothing happened at the bonfire. What happened to you? He tried to... He tried to force me. The quarterback? He threw me down and I hit my head and I woke up somewhere else. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I lied to you. I didn't know what else to do. I can't prove anything. He was going to get away with it again. I'm not the only one. Please, you can't say anything. No one's going to know. No one's going to know a thing. Hello. Isaac? You doing okay? Go away, man. Isaac, I need your help. You need help? Ask Simone. You already took her. What else do you want from me? You painted me. A picture of me flying. Okay, it happened. It was real. I flew. Congratulations. I'm telling you that I believe you. That you can paint the future. So, whatever is happening to you it's happening to me, too. And I don't know why, but I'm supposed to see you. You're supposed to have the answer. Is that what I sound like? No wonder she left me. I don't have any answers. You're supposed to know where I have to go. See for yourself. It's her, the cheerleader. I'll get it. You bet. Vote Petrelli! Early and often. Oh, up, up and away. Absolutely. Vroom, vroom. Tell Sakamoto I'm back and we need to talk. Yes, sir. I didn't think I'd see you again. That's all right. I'm good. I'm good. What the hell did you do to me? I could ask you the same thing. All I know is that I woke up in your room somehow, and you were gone. All you know? We had a great dinner, then you leave. You come back and attack me. I had one of the best nights in my entire life, and next thing I know somebody is trying to throw me into a van. I don't know what happened last night. I swear. Look, all I know is that when I met you I was trying to be someone I'm not. And that's not who I want to be. Who do you want to be? Someone good. A good mother. Not the person that I see in the mirror. Look, I don't know how much of last night was an act and how much was you. The girl I met, that's the kind of girl you spend your entire life waiting to meet. Somebody strong, somebody beautiful, somebody good. I didn't know they were going to do anything to you. They blackmailed me, just like they're going to blackmail you. They taped us? I'm so sorry, Nathan. Wow. Is it Christmas? No, come here. What is all this? This is the Shiraz from that great place in the Sonoma Valley. Remember we went there a million years ago and you've been thinking about going back? How do you know that? And porterhouse steaks from Mickey's that you craved, and I'm going to pretend that I cooked for you tonight. Oh, and... Wait, I've had that song in my head for days. Oh, I know. I don't know what to say. How about pass the salad? So, who is she? Oh, that's nice. What? A guy can't pretend to cook dinner for his wife without being accused of cheating on her? Well, you were missing for a day and now this. Okay, I'm sorry. Thought this is what you wanted. Everything I could think of, you thought of first. It's our best date. It's our only date we've had in a long time. We've had in a long time. Okay, you know what? Let's... Let's call this the first of many to come. Why? Do you have something planned for tonight? Oh, I do now. Good. Hello, Brody. I'm Claire's father. I know who you are. You're the guy I'm going to sue. I'm very sorry about the accident. It wasn't an accident. What makes you say that? Because she crashed my car on purpose. She's a freak! She's not human. I put more stock in her humanity than I would in yours. You tried to rape my daughter. I didn't touch her. Well, it's her word against yours and from my perspective she's the more reliable witness. You don't know your daughter. I know her better than even she does. I don't have to listen to this. Claire is a very special girl. It's confusing what's happening to her and she doesn't need some punk making her life anymore difficult. Do you understand me? I should kill you. But instead I'm going to do you a favor. You already threw away this life. I'm going to give you a second chance. I'm going to let you forget all the terrible things you've done. And maybe this time when you wake up in your new life you'll make something decent of it. Hollow him out. Take everything. Whoa. This is amazing. Look, it's telling a story like a comic. This girl, she's running and... Is that me? Why would I paint you? And these two guys. I think we're all trying to help her. Cheerleader. Who is she? I don't know. Yeah, but you painted these. I was high, dawg. So, what happens next? Where is she? I was high! I could've been clean. I tore myself apart. I lost Simone to try and find an answer, how to stop it. All I got was this garbage. Some cheerleader. It's nothing. I ruined my life for nothing. It's not nothing. Look, don't you get it? Everything's connected. We are all connected. If this thing that you painted, this bomb, is true, we're all dead. These are the key to saving us. Something's going to happen to this girl. We need to know what. You're gonna have to finish this. You have to finish the painting. Even if I wanted to I can't. I'm out of drugs, and I'm out of money to buy drugs. Can't you just finish it without shooting up? If you've got some cash on you, man. That's another story. We'll call it a commission. I saw it. What? I saw something in the canvas, the picture. This painting, I can finish it. You can paint? No. No, I can't. But... I drew the future after I saw you the other day. It was only stick figures, but it came true. Hi, Brody. I know you probably don't want to see me right now or hear what I have to say, but I have to say it. What you did to me, what you tried to do was wrong. But what I did to you was wrong, too, and I'm sorry. I think that everyone deserves a do-over at least once in their lives. I don't know you. Who are you? Brody, it's me, Claire. Why do you keep calling me Brody? Micah? Where's my son? Micah? Hi. What happened? They showed up a few hours ago. They're looking for D.L. I told them you haven't seen him in months. Miss Sanders? Uh-huh. Is this your husband, miss? Yeah. What's going on with D. L? Did he try to contact you at all in the past few days? My dad didn't do anything. Micah, I need you to wait with Tina for another minute, okay? Ma'am, your husband was spotted at a convenience store not far from here about an hour ago. He's here? No sign of him yet. But we've got cars hidden around the block in case he tries to make contact. D.L.'s been on the run for six months. Why haven't you caught him? We had him in custody two days ago. He pulled a Houdini, slipped out of his cuffs. D.L. Hawkins is a killer. He has been following me doing things. What sort of things? Look, if he's here, and he wants something, then I won't be able to stop him. You need to protect us. OFFICER ON RADIO: We've got someone coming. He's headed for the house. Get these people safe. He's headed for the back door. Repeat, cover the back door. Dad. Freeze! Hands up! Hands up! Niki? Your men are worried about you, Mr. Petrelli. Are you all right? I'm fine, but I can't say I'm pleased with the security situation. You have the hotel's sincerest apologies. Consider your stay on us. If there's anything else you need just ask. Actually I was wondering how that tape turned out. Consider it a favor you'll repay one day. Or what? For a man whose campaign is founded on sound family values, this could be really embarrassing for you. Especially considering your wife. On the other hand, that tape really isn't worth much unless I win, is it? Why don't you just give me my four million and I'll fly back to New York and put it to good use? Our agreement was two million. That's rather generous. Yeah, I thought so, too. And then I thought, "Gee, it must be pretty important for Linderman to see me in office "if he's willing to go to this much trouble to keep me in line." Two million dollars makes me a candidate in your pocket. Four million makes me a congressman. That was so... I love you. I love you. It's like you're in my head. It's like... What can I get you? Nothing. Just sleep for a week. Coffee ice cream? You got it. Coffee ice cream coming up. I skipped lunch. Do you have aspirin? Security camera. He makes a move I'll blow his head off. I need cookies. I'm going to have to work out. Clean everything out the register. Probably get a couple hundred in cash, too. Hey. Look, I know why you're here. And I just want to say don't do this. What the hell do you know? Nothing. But I'm a cop. But I am not armed. Okay, I just came in here to get some ice cream for my wife, but I know what you're thinking about doing. I know that you could pull out the gun that you've got in there, and you could shoot me. But then you'd be throwing your life away. For what? A couple of twenties in the register? Huh? Look, I know you're hurting. But Marie is waiting for you at home, right? And Vincent is getting out in a month. All you have to do is just take your hand out of your jacket pocket, and put the gun down, and get out of here. Oh, my God, is that a gun? He's got a gun. No, no, no, no, no. Don't shoot me. Call the cops. I'm a cop. Doesn't look like police to me. I can't believe this is happening. It's okay, I'm a cop. What's wrong with him? Probably crazy. Don't shoot me. It's okay, I'm a cop. I just want to get out of here. Someone call the police. It's okay! You're "HuggerZ"? The guy from Japan? He's one of my customers. I run a website. How did you find me? "WHO-IS" database. You need unlist. Maybe. You shouldn't have come. I live here. My kid is in the other room. What did you think was going to happen? I'm sorry. We chat so much online I thought... I thought you maybe help me. You got the wrong girl. That person that you see on the internet, that's not me. You get the difference, right? Do you understand? Do you want us to take him in for trespassing? Just let him go home. It was nice to meet you. Okay. We'll leave a squad car outside in case your husband decides to show, Miss Sanders. Thank you. Hello? How'd you do that? I don't know. We have to save her. Ignore it. It's a wrong number. Some Japanese guy keeps calling and leaving messages. Hello. Mr. Isaac? Isaac Mendez? Who is this? Oh, my name is Hiro Nakamura. My name is Peter Petrelli. I have a message for you. I don't think they can her you. Well it makes me feel better! Wow... Good -- I'm starving. Shut up, I'm not talking to you. Do you think they have waffles? I said I'm not talking to you. I can't believe I got beat up because of you. I've never gotten beat up before. I got punched too. Once. They kept kicking me! My jaw is clicking, did it used to click? Let's just eat then get the car back, okay? This is all you fault, Hiro. All you had to do was stop time, and we would still have our money. My fault? We got beat up because you made us cheat at gambling. Using my powers for personal gain. That's the Dark Side. Not being broke is the Dark Side? Oh, waffles! I don't know why I'm on this stupid trip. I've told you now a hundred times. To save the world. "Save the world!" Don't you ever think of anything else? All you've done since you came to America is complain. If you're so miserable here, go back to Japan. I'm not miserable hier. I'm miserable with you! Then go. Go gamble and meet girls. Hang out with your internet stripper without me if that's what you want. Fine-- maybe I will. Okay, then go-- Okay-- I'm not following you. Good! You don't even know anyone in Las Vegas. You don't know anyone in this country. Yes, I do! I'll probably save the world faster now. Move! Get out of the way! Maybe there're instructions. It's all English... I guess... ...we call the artist again.
