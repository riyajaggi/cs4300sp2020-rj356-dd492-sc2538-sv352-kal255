 I love you dad. This is Claire Bennet. It really does break my heart. Please don't hurt me. You're not supposed to be in here. I didn't kill these people, Sylar did. - You're under arrest. - What? Hello. Nice to meet you. I love New York. Mr. Isaac Mendez? Mr. Isaac? We've got a live on here. No English, no passport, no american money, no ID. How long ago did he do this?

 - Yesterday. - Yesterday. October 2. Ocotber 2? No, pal. Today... November 8. Chapter Three One giant leap. When evolution selects its agents, it does so at a cost. It makes demands in exchange for singularity. And you may be asked to do something against your very nature. Suddenly, the change in your life that should have been wonderful, comes as a betrayal. It may seem cruel, but the goal is nothing short of self-preservation. Survival. So, if our team wins, there'll be a celebratory bonfire, where I need to represent. So it might be, like, midnight-ish. On a school night? A celebratory school night. - So, is that the quarterback? - Who? The boy that you like, right over there. I don't like him. I mean, he's a very nice boy, but-- Yes, he's the quarterback. If you really wanted to make me happy, you'd only date nerds. Well, it worked out very well for your mother. - I love your glasses, Mr. Bennet. - Thank you, Jackie. Rumor has it you're a local hero. Pulled a man out of a burning train car. You heard about that? O.M.G., does everybody know? It was on the news. You told half the school to set their TiVos. It's going to be the cornerstone of my campaign for class president. I'm running on a platform of moral, mental, and social advancement through good deeds. What do you think? I think I need to get something out of my locker. Hey. Claire. Be careful. Okay? Where have you been tje last two days? I teleported myself in the future! Haven't we been over all this? Then explain this. It tells the whole story of my heroic journey. Is this how you spend your time? Read it! I'm on the subway in Japan. Suddenly, I'm in New York! Five weeks in the future! Been hitting the sake? I found the book's author, but he was dead! Then, there's a nuclear explosion. It all happens in five weeks... and you and I have to stop it. Definitely the sake. Look, you're in it too! How could I know you were going to say that? We have work to do. If you still work here. Listen, if I cn prove to you beyond a shadow of a doubt. Will you come with me? We have to go right now! A girl's life depends on us! It'll work. We'll have the fundraiser here, not the ballroom. Makes me look fiscally responsible. - Yes, it does. - Pete, just the man I want to see. - I need to talk to you. - What do you think? Red or blue? I don't know. Blue? I'm gonna wear red. The president wears red. So you gonna come tonight? Gonna break out the suit, have a couple of drinks. Rebuff the advances of my cute interns? Emily. Yeah, I'm gonna be there. Listen, I tried it again. Tried what? What do you mean what? What do you think that I mean? I tried to fly. Would you keep your voice down? You were there. Last night I could fly. This morning, nothing. I nearly broke my neck trying. Well, it would have solved one of our problems. So I went to the library to see if I could find anything on human flight. I came across this amazing book. Listen to this. "Genes determine obesity, blood pressure. "Out of the 30 billion possibilities one might contain the poial for human flight." This guy knows what's going on. Chandra Suresh. He's a genetics professor in India. I called. They said that he quit six months ago. They think he's here in New York. We gotta find this guy. We've got a more immediate problem here. - What? - It's this woman reporter. She's poking around into why you jumped off the roof. Look, Nathan, we flew. Aren't you curious how this happened? Yeah, I mean, I want answers, just like everyone else. I mean, just like you, okay? But right now, today, I'm trying to find a way to put a spin on this so it doesn't look like crazy runs in our family. I need to figure out why this is happening to me. To us. Responsibilities, Pete, okay? I've got a election to and a family to feed, okay? You are so-- What do you wanto tell that reporter? I know one thing we can't tell her. The truth. Sorry. I still have your dad's keys. Maybe I shouldn't. Sorry. After being attacked, every noise I hear-- Sorry. Well, this is macaroni and cheese. It's what Americans eat when they want to commit suicide slowly. Your dad said mine was the best he ever had, but he was from India, so-- Thank you. You're very kind. You look like hell. When was the last time you slept? All this work. I'm no closer to understanding my father's research. Well, what about the program on your dad's computer? Didn't you say he cracked some code? I thought he had. But the algorithm... It's gibberish. Know anybody who speaks gibberish? The man with the horned-rim glasses. He chased me around the world-- Madras, Manhattan, this very apartment-- looking for it. But this isn't anything. Well, then, why would he build it? Why? It was always this way with my father. Every question met with another question. Never an answer. Only "why?" Even after he's dead. - Well, what about the map? - The map. The map is nothing until I can decipher the principle behind it. You know, if I could find even one such person, it would validate everything he believed. But I can't. Your father had a lot of faith in you. My father only cared about proving he was right. He left his country, his family, chasing this insanity. And now I'm wasting my life trying to prove him sane. - Where did it get me? - Mohinder! I'm sorry. I'm just so tired. "Sylar." What is it? Yet another question. I don't know how else to explain this. I heard a little girl call for help. I went to her. That's all that happened. So you just waltzed right in, found a kid hiding in a wall, then pulled the name Sylar out of your ass, when only a handful of us know that name. It's like-- It was like someone was talking to me. Except it was in my head. Did the voices tell you anything else? They want you to do things? Rob a store, kill the president? No. It's more like I can... hear people's thoughts. Or something. I don't know. Can you tell me what I'm thinking? No, I really can't control this. It just sort of happens. Give it a shot, Carnac. I'm wide open. You think I'm nuts. Or stupid. Great trick. Stop wasting my time. Come on, Parkman, I need this more than you do. - Nobody believes in me. - Nobody believes in you. I know what that's like. How much longer do I have to be in here? Depends. How'd you like to work with the FBI? Claire. What are you doing running off to an away game? That tape with all your attempts at bodily harm is still missing. Yeah, well if someone finds it, we'll just tell 'em you're some visual effects geek who did it with his computer. Now, can I get back to my life, please? So that's it? You're just gonna go pump your pom-poms, and pretend you're no different than any other girl on the squad? Yes, actually. But you are, Claire. You are different. Don't you see that? Don't you see that none of this matters? School spirit doesn't matter. Being a pretty blonde cheerleader doesn't matter. - It's not who you are anymore. - Who am I? So what, I can crawl through a wood chipper, and live to tell about it. That narrows my choices in life to freak or guinea pig. In most cases, both. What's wrong with wanting to be normal? You should try it. What are you doing here? The door was open. Isaac, you have to get back to work. Your editor-- The comic book is late. You were taking them, weren't you? Yes, I'm going to sell them in my gallery. And with the money, we can get you straightened out. Into rehab. I'm not going into rehab. I found all your junk. The drugs, all of it. I flushed everything. How am I supposed to paint the future? Nobody can paint the future. That's the drugs talking. Look around you at all these paintings! Every one of them has come true. Oh. And does that include this big one on the floor of New York going nuclear? Yes. I don't know how, I don't know when, but-- I have to stop it. I don't want to lose you, Simone. But if you don't believe in me, then you shouldn't be here. Fine. You think you can paint the future. Paint one without me in it. Hello? I can't understand a word you're saying. Stop calling me here. You've got the wrong number. Wrong number. Who are you calling? The comic book author,. To warn him about the future. He keeps hanging up on me. Thet's because you're crazy. I'd hang up on you too if I could. This is the spot! A young girl dressed in a school uniform... will step in front of a speeding truc. And we have to save her. See? What school girl? Okay. Which one is she? I don't know. She has a red bow in her hair! I'll go this ay, you go that way. Ando! Stop that truck! Stop, watch out! I did it! You did it! So you believe me now? You'll come with me? - Hi. - Hi. - How'd you sleep? - Good. Where are we? On our way to Grandma's house. Micah! Grandma. - Oh, my. You've grown. - You always say that. - I do. - Yes, you do. Why don't you go on inside? You look thin. Look, I know what it's like to raise a boy on your own. To be stretched so far, you wish you could be in two places at once. I get it. But that boy needs more than you've been giving him. He needs a steady hand and a stable environment. I can give him that. Why, because D.L. grew up to be such a model citizen? My son, your husband, is a good man. You recognize this? I found it in the desert. What's that supposed to be? This belonged to one of the men that your son murdered. I took it out of the grave. You know that all of D.L.'s crew wore these. D.L. wouldn't murder anybody. - Ever. - Wrong. He robbed Linderman and got away with $2 million, - and then he killed his crew. - My son was framed. And he'd be rotting in some prison if he hadn't escaped. Besides, if D.L. had $2 million... Honey, he'd be on some tropical island someplace, sitting out his years, with Micah. I want you out of my son's life. Yeah, well, people in hell want ice water. It doesn't mean they're going to get it. Paulette, you have no idea what I am capable of. You want to tell me why I'm still here, or am I just gonna follow you around? I need you to talk to her. Find out what she knows. - Talk to who? - Molly Walker. The little girl you found. We're keeping her here, where it's safe, until we can figure out what to do with her. She's been through a severe trauma. Both parents murdered right in front of her. She hasn't said a word since we brought her here. What makes you think she's gonna talk to me? Well, if you're really a mind reader, she won't need to. Who is this Sylar? What's he doing? We've pieced a trail across a dozen states. All people impaled by household objects. Bones broken. All without any traceable sign of physical contact. But only some of them involve any mutilation of the head or neck, so they don't see the connections. You think it's all him. I think it's gonna get a lot worse if someone doesn't go after him. Mr. Sylar? Hello? What are you actually gonna do if Sylar's in there? If Sylar killed my father, I need to know why. I suppose that would have been too easy. Let's go. No, all the answers could be behind this door. It's locked, and I'm kinda trying not to freak out now. So can we please just go? Or we could just break in. A little light reading before bed. Oh, my God. That map, those strings-- It's exactly like your father's. Not exactly. This map has more of them. Dozens more. I know that guy. He's running for Congress. - His life may be in danger. - Okay, can we please go now? - Not yet. - Mohinder-- Dear God. What was my father involved with? We're keeping her in a safe room down here. It's him. It's Sylar. Freeze! Hey. Hey, remember me? It's okay. It's okay. No one's gonna hurt you, honey. How could he find me? That doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. You're safe now. You're safe. All right. All right. Show me your hands! Do it or I'll put you down! You okay? I'm confused. You said you called me when you went in the future. Yeah. So? So, shouldn't I be at home... waiting for your call. We're changing the future. By taking action we've changed soemthing. What if we make it worse? And if there's going to be a nuclear explosion... Shouldn't we be flying away from the bomb? A hero doesn't run away from his destiny. My only concern is... whether I need to hide my true identity. Perhaps a costume? You even mention tights and a cape, I'm going home. You can't go home. The comic book says we fly together, so we fly together. Does it say we have to fly coach? - Simone. - Oh, hey. I was just coming up to check on my dad. Where are you going? Aren't you supposed to be on your shift? I was just filling in my replacement, and saying bye to your dad. What? - Come here a second. - No. - I'm quitting. - Why? I called the agency and told them this morning. But my father-- Caroline's gonna take really great care-- But she's not you. This is not where I'm supposed to be. It's not what I'm supposed to do. I can't really explain it. Well, try. Look, the truth is, I've been trying to save the world, one person at a time but I'm meant for something bigger. Something important. I know it now. That's really all I can tell you. I'll miss you. It's New York. Everyone runs into each other sooner or later. Maybe it'll be sooner. Flames were everywhere. Oh, my God, I could hear the poor man coughing somewhere inside the train car. But there was smoke everywhere. I couldn't see him. I was so scared, you guys. I was really scared. Nice effigy. Thanks. I stayed up all night stuffing it with newspaper. I would have filled his head with firecrackers, but that's just me. - That would have been cool. - Careful. If you stand too close, you'll end up like that guy. I'm not as flammable as he is. Dale Ledgerwood's got a keg in the back of his truck. Are you sure this is okay? We're 30 miles from home. Who's gonna know? Jackie told me you wanna meet your real mom and dad. I told Jackie that in confidence. You do realize you were talking to Jackie, right? Is that why you're bummed? The whole adoption thing? I mean, you didn't, like just find out, did you? Oh, no, no, no. They told me when I was really little. Why do you think I'm bummed? You don't seem like yourself. Thought maybe something was wrong. You don't know me well enough to know when I'm not being myself. You never drink plain milk. It's always chocolate. You draw mermaids in the margins of your notebook. Put crackers in your sandwiches to make them crunch. And you're usually the first person to laugh at a joke. But I haven't heard you laugh in a while. Lately you seem sort of sad. Have you been spying on me? Claire, my goal tonight is to hear you laugh. Did you put firecrackers in his head, just for me? Hey, you waited up for me. Look, I know I missed our therapy session. - It's fine. - No, it wasn't. I'm sorry. I was supposed to call you, and I meant to. I had the craziest day today. You would not believe what happened to me. It was so strange, and it was amazing and-- I don't even know how to describe it. Then don't. That's it? That's it? You waited up all this time so that you could tell me that you don't want to talk to me? Look, I really don't want this to turn into a fight. And if I say anything else, it will. I'm really trying, Matt. You know, this marriage may not mean anything to you-- What? It does. Of course it does. What are you talking about? I have a lot of stuff going on right now. So do I. It was supposed to be a good thing when I made associate, and you were suppose to be happy for me. But ever since, it's like you're mad at me for getting what I wanted, because you haven't. I don't mean to be. It's just-- It's hard. I can't do this anymore. I wish he would just leave. Fine. I will. Wait. Let's take a little break. Want to go back to the party? No, I just-- I'm going through something and I don't know if now's the right time. You know what? You just need to relax. What's gotten into you? I just really like you, Claire. Don't you like me? No, Brody, stop. Don't hurt yourself. - No, stop it! - No! Don't be a bitch. Let it happen! Claire. Claire! You haven't said a word the whole way home. Boy, that has got to be a record. Are you hungry? You know, I was thinking that we could stop by that ice cream shop on the way home. You know, the one with those ginormous banana splits? Why don't you believe that Dad's innocent? I mean, you should be trying to help him. I know that you want to believe in your father. But I know what's best, Micah. They're gonna catch him, and he's gonna go away for a long time. - They'll never find him. - How do you know that? Micah, do you know where he is? It's okay. Is there a problem, Officer? Mr. Linderman wants to see you. I'm with my son. So I guess sooner rather than later. - To destiny. - Mmm. May we recognize it when we see it. To love. May we stay away from it when it's no good for us. You know earlier today, when you were telling me how you'd changed? Yeah. I noticed it. There's just something different. It's like a look in your eye. A confidence. There's something I should tell you. Something, uh... I didn't think was right to say when I still worked for your father. Something I wouldn't have even said to you two days ago. I've been in love with you since the minute I first laid eyes on you. Excuse me. Everyone excuse me. I'd like to apologize about the rain. If you elect me, I promise I'll try and do something about it. I'd like to welcome you all here, on behalf of my family, my entire campaign staff. I'm sure that you know my brave wife would be here by my side, were she able. The life-altering event of my father's death is really what prompted me to run for Congress. My father hid a deep depression-- an illness, really-- up until the day he died. His loving wife, his attentive children, his loyal friends-- we all knew about it, and yet he suffered alone. As many of you might have read, my brother Peter had an accident. But what I have kept from the press thus far is that Peter barely survived a suicide attempt. My first instinct was to keep his illness hidden. But no one should suffer alone. Because we're all connected somehow. Everyone in this room. You, me, everyone in this city. And we need to look out for each other. - Nissan Versa. Nissan Versa. - That's a popular choice. Let me check to see if we still have any left. - Nissan-- - Hiro. We've got a connecting flight leaving for New York. We're not flying. Why not? It says we rent a car. We drive all the way? Yes, in a Nissan Versa. Do you know how long that's going to take? Suppose she doesn't have that exact car? You're in luck. We have one left. It's our destiny. So, where to? Las Vegas. It's our destiny. How you doing? Well, I'm, uh-- It's a rhetorical question. Just say "fine" and order a drink. Uh, fine. Whatever you got on tap. Do I have time for another one? I don't want to go home to that shrew. She's sucking the life out of me. What's he looking at? Barking up the wrong tree, pal. What am I doing here? Am I that desperate? She is diggin' me. I am in for sure. What if I just disappeared? Would anybody care? How long would it take to notice I'm gone? We were in the apartment. We saw everything. Wanna tell me what you were doing in there? Please, just follow me. I believe this man Sylar killed my father. He has a list of targets, including a man who's running for Congress. He turns around to the other one and says, "Holy cow, a talking dog." You son of a bitch! Let him go. Easy, Pete, that's our mother you're talking about. There was no reporter on my story! There would have been, eventually. I had to take control of things before something happened. You get it, right? - Yeah, I get it. - Good man. - You're bleeding. - What? Look, what Nathan said, it's not true. - I didn't try to kill myself. - I know. This force, evolution, is not sentimental. Like the earth itself, it knows only the hard facts of life's struggle with death. All you can do it hope and trust that when you've served its needs faithfully, there may still remain some glimmer of the life you once knew.
