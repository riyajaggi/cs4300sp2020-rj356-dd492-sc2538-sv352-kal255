 Heroes (2006â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 2 - Chapter Two 'Don't Look Back' - full transcript 
 When Nikki wakes up, she sees the two criminals dead in her garage. She brings her son and finds a brand new Cadillac in her name and the bodies in the trunk, with instructions and a map to bury the corpses in the desert. Peter awakes in the hospital and his mother tells him that his father was depressed and committed suicide. When Peter decides to jump from the terrace of his building, his brother Nathan discloses that both can fly. Hiro is teleported to the Times Square and finds a comic book written by Isaac Mendez telling his saga. He goes to Isaac studio, finds him dead and is arrested by the police. A man pretending to be an exterminator bugs Mohinder's apartment, but he fights with the guy and is helped by his next door neighbor. In Los Angeles, the Police Officer Matt Parkman telepathically hears the voice of a child in a murder scene and is arrested as a suspect. Claire hides her heroic rescue in the fire and her evil stepfather discloses her abilities in her stolen tape.

 Previously on Heroes. Five strangers across the globe began to discover they had extraordinary abilities. From the cheerleader who realized she's invincible... Oh, my... I have busted like every bone in my body yet I don't have a scratch on me. ...to the office worker who can bend space and time. These strangers are discovering they're meant for something more. Do you ever get the feeling like you were meant to do something extraordinary? And as a son seeks the truth by finishing his father's work... I spoke to him two days ago.

 He was this close to finding the first of them. He's forced to run from a man surrounded in mystery. He left everything behind but his computer. A man who is more connected than anyone imagined. Hi, Daddy. Hey, baby. And now, Heroes continues. We all imagine ourselves the agents of our destiny, capable of determining our own fate. But have we truly any choice in when we rise? Or when we fall? Or does a force larger than ourselves bid us our direction? Is it evolution that takes us by the hand? Does science point our way? Or is it God who intervenes, keeping us safe?

 Whoa. Whoa. Easy, buddy. Where am I? You're in a hospital. What happened? You don't remember? No. You jumped, Pete. Jumped? Off the roof of a 15-story building. You tried to kill yourself. You were a little wound up yesterday, but I thought you were just being you. What are you talking about? I didn't try to kill myself. You were in the alley below. I jumped and you... You flew. I what? You flew up and you caught me. You jumped, Peter. Twenty-five feet to a fire escape. I climbed up and carried you down. That's what happened. The rest is just crazy talk. You understand? Dad? Do you mind if I talk to you about something? You pregnant? What? No. You doing drugs? Dad. Actually, I already know what it's about. You do? It's about wanting to know who you really are. Your mother told me you've been asking about your birth parents. Well, I think it's time that I knew. Well, I have a few questions first, not the least of which is, why now? I'm just wondering, that's all. You know, what they're like, what they can do. What they can do? Yeah, like hobbies and skills. You know, I don't mean this to be condescending, even though you're going to say I'm being condescending, but I really do believe that this is an adult decision. You're right. That is condescending. Claire, there are going to be issues. You're going to have issues. They're going to have issues. It's very complex, emotionally. Yeah, well, so am I. Well, exactly. Look, here's my advice if you'll indulge me. Just keep things light and fun as long as you can, like cheerleading. Being a cheerleader is hard work. Hard, treacherous work. Well, of course it is, sweetheart. I don't want to be late. Hey. I just don't want you to be in such a hurry to grow up, okay? Trust me. I actually know a few things. Who are you? Whoa! Whoa! Hi. Sorry. Sorry. Easy. Easy. Your super let us in. We're doing the whole building today. I just got done with the lady with the dog and the cough, and almost done here. Listen, it looks like some cockroaches might have infested your, uh, floor boards. Who are you? What did you do to my father? Let's take a little breather, huh, professor? I suppose the cockroaches are the least of my problems. Yeah, no argument there. Did you kill my father? I think we're done here, don't you? So, I'll tell you what, have a really great day. Hey, look, I'm just the exterminator. This guy came in and pulled a gun on me. He is not an exterminator. He's paranoid. I was just in there spraying bugs in his apartment, and he came in and freaked out. If you're the exterminator, why do you have a gun holster? Thanks for coming to my rescue. You're welcome. Mohinder Suresh. The professor's son. Taxi! Taxi! Hello, New York! Hello. Nice to meet you. I love New York! Hello. Wassup? Hey, pal, this isn't a library. No pay, no read. Hey! Get back here! Hey, slow down, buddy! Simone. Shh. You had a hard night. I saw it. There was a bright light. Like an explosion. It wiped out the whole city. Like Hiroshima or... Shh. it's okay, it was all a dream. No. I don't think so. Yes. I shot up last night. I had to. Yes. I painted what I saw. Is it there? Do you see it? Yes, I see it, but you need to rest. We have to warn them. Warn who? FBI, Homeland Security. We need to tell someone. Isaac, you can't paint the future. No one will believe you. I'd hoped you would. None of it is real. What is real is you got a drug problem. You overdosed on heroin last night. You're lucky to be alive. You know I'm watching my father die. And I can't watch you die, too. So you need to make a choice. Me or this. It's not about having big hands. Most guys' hands are too rough with the details. Mine are sensitive. Feel how soft they are. Wow! But you've got dainty hands. My mom says my hands are very dainty. Maybe I should try out for the football team. Claire, may I borrow your ear just for a minute. Why? Hey Zach, is it true you got an erection in the boys' locker room? It's really urgent. Not now. Not now. Claire, Jackie, the sheriff and some firemen would like to have a word with you two. Okay. - Hi, this is Niki. - Leave me a message. Mom, are you there? When are you coming to get me? I hate it here. Come back soon. Just come pick me up, okay? Honey, I'm so sorry. I'm on my way. Baby, I'm only five minutes away, okay? I know. I love you. Come on. Yeah. That's the way I like it. Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Come on. What's the problem, baby? Things just started getting good here. I said, what's the problem? Screw you. Hello. Mom? Where have you been? I called you like four hours ago. What? Four hours? Yeah. I'll be right there, baby. What is the matter with you, making him wait like that? I'm sorry. Can I have two seconds? Okay, what the hell is going on, Niki? Something terrible has happened. What? What is it? Those guys that you said Linderman would send to get his money back? Yeah. Well, he did. And now they're dead, on the floor of my garage. What? How? That's just it. I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I mean, I don't know. I woke up and they were dead. I think that I might... Sometimes I look in the mirror and I'm not sure it's me that I'm seeing. Maybe it was D. L. You know? He's trying to protect you because he still loves you and Micah... D. L. wouldn't risk coming back. The cops are after him. And once Linderman finds out that they're dead, it's not going to matter who killed them. He's gonna come after me. Then you need to listen to me. Niki, you have to call the police. No. I've gotta... I gotta cover my tracks, and then I gotta run. I gotta go. All right. Why would anybody want to tap Papa Suresh's phone? "Papa" Suresh? Yeah, he told me to call him that after I butchered his name a couple of times. I don't know why someone would want to tap his phone. Back in Madras I found a man in his apartment stealing his research, and now this. Well, why don't you just ask your dad? I mean, he must have some idea who it is. My father died four days ago. What? I'm sorry. I... You didn't know? He was murdered in his cab. Oh, my God. How awful. You were close? Yeah, I mean I hate cooking for one so I used to make extra and bring it over, and we would eat together. And he'd tell me about his theories and the map. We were friends. Well, then you were closer to him than I was. Happy to hear he had someone to talk to. I'll get you some water. I had no idea anything was wrong. I knocked on the door a couple of times. I just... I thought he was out and we were missing each other. I had this book I wanted to show him. What book? Darwin's Origin of Species. Thank you. It's a true first edition. I work at this antique book store, and I found a copy. And I just thought he'd get a kick out of reading it. Oh, he most definitely would have gotten a kick out of it. That's very thoughtful. You know, he told me he was being watched. I thought that he was just eccentric. I like that you didn't use the word paranoid. Do you think that they're watching you now? They could have killed me if that's what they wanted. For the time being it seems I'm more important to them alive. You said that he talked to you about his theories and the map. I need you to tell me everything he said to you, everything you remember. Everything. Girls, this isn't a criminal investigation. Nobody here is in any kind of trouble. Quite the contrary, there just happens to be a very grateful man lying in the hospital who'd like thank one of you for saving his life yesterday. I've never seen anyone so reluctant to be called a hero. You're sure it was one of our cheerleaders? The uniform said Union Wells High. I'd have to say it was... Her on the end. That's Claire Bennet. Claire, where did you go yesterday after cheerleading practice? L, uh... it wasn't her. It was me. I was taking a shortcut home from school, and I saw the wreckage of the train wreck, and I just had to help. Why didn't you say something? I guess I didn't want all the attention, you know? It's not why I did it. Well, on behalf of the Odessa Fire Department, I'd like to congratulate you as an honorary fire fighter. How is he? Who? The man Jackie pulled out of the train. Well, he's got some pretty bad burns, smoke damage to his lungs, but he's alive, happy to be so. Thanks to Jackie. Claire! I'm glad I finally got you alone. Look we have to talk. Did you hear they asked Jackie to be the grand marshal of the Pioneer Day Parade? They're going to put her on top of the fire truck. They should put her under the fire truck. Look, it's about the video tape. What? The video tape! The tape where you're like killing yourself 20 times! Oh, yeah, that. Can we just keep that under wraps? That's what I'm trying to tell you. it was in my backpack and now it's not. What? It's gone. What do you mean, it's gone? Oh, my God! Claire, I'm so sorry! Are you all right? Yeah. I'm okay. I'm all right. Uh, yeah, you just caught me off guard. I thought I heard something snap. Nope. I'm okay! I'm fine! I'm okay! - All right! That's it. - Shows over. Yep, not a scratch on me. I guess you're not so dainty after all. I'm dainty enough. We have got to find that tape. What if I don't want to go on vacation? You don't have a choice. You have to. Why are we doing this, Mom? Why won't you just tell me what's going on? I wish that I could, baby. But you are just going to have to trust me, okay? Now, go and pack up your stuff. I have to take care of something in the garage. Mom? What happened to our house? Micah, you're just gonna have to trust me, okay? Now, go in and grab some stuff. Go. Help me understand what you were doing on that roof. I can't. Not yet, but I will. You just have to trust me. There's something you need to know about your father's death. He committed suicide. What? He committed suicide. I found him on the floor of the bathroom. You said he had a heart attack. I lied. For his reputation. His heart was fine. But he had had two others before that. Well, I lied about those, too. Suicide attempts. Both of them. He finally got what he wanted. When he was 23 he was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. He couldn't help it. It was just who he was. Why didn't I know about any of this before? Your father and I decided not to tell you since the disorder can have a genetic link, and you were always so sensitive. We didn't want you to worry about it. But you're telling me now. It can start with delusions of grandeur. Thinking you're invincible or indestructible. They are irrational thoughts that then turn suicidal. It's time you took a hard look at your life. And if there are changes to be made, I wanna be here to help you. Because there's something else I never told you. Come here. You were always my favorite. I cannot lose you. Mr. lsaac Mendez? Hello? Mr. lsaac? Freeze! Drop your weapon. Get your damn hands up! Cover the back. Serial killer strikes in the middle of Los Angeles, abducts a little girl, and here I am. A hundred feet away, might as well be in Siberia. That's all right. They don't pay us enough to be where the action is. What are you going to do anyway? What do you mean? I just want to help. You want to help? Help me get more tape. What do you think? CIA or FBI? No, she's dressed too nice for FBI. Saw the test scores got posted this morning. Don't worry about it, man. Not everybody's a test-taker. Who wants to be a detective anyway? Please don't hurt me. Got to spend half your salary buying suits. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. 9 out of 10 of these guys... Please don't hurt me. You all right, man? Please don't. Please don't. Please don't hurt me. And we don't have any idea what happened in here. I've got a theory. You always do. This is Barstow all over again. It's Sylar. There is no Sylar. Last words of a dying victim. It didn't mean anything. And look at her. Must have taken three guys to lift her up that high. What about the daughter? No sign. We checked the house and surrounding, issued an Amber Alert. You've seen what happened to the father. Frozen solid, skull sawed off. We need to find out how. The little girl is the priority. Please don't hurt me. Don't hurt me. Please don't. Don't hurt me. Please. You are not supposed to be in here. Please, please don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me. It's okay. it's okay. You're safe now. Look, I'm a cop. I'm one of the good guys, okay? He hurt my mom and dad. Please don't hurt me. I'm not going to let anybody hurt you. No, no. Come on, take my hand. It's okay. Come on. It's okay. Come on. For years he'd been working on a mathematical theorem using human genomes and DNA migration patterns. He thought he could find a way to identify these people, the ones who were special. I never believed it was possible. We fought about it constantly. It's the reason we grew apart. - You've reached Chandra Suresh. - Please leave a message. He's got messages. Chandra, this is Emi. You forgot to turn in your trip sheets for last week. Where is your head, man? Oh, my God! Mohinder! Yes? No, the other Mohinder. The lizard. He's got to be around here somewhere. Hi, I'm Nathan Petrelli. It would be an honor to represent New York's 14th District. When the time comes, vote Petrelli. Hello, Chandra. Why won't you talk to me? You can't leave me like this. Hello. Mr. Sylar? I asked you not to call here anymore. The hunger, it's... I can't control it. I don't want to. You made me this way. I made you a murderer? You helped me to discover my potential. You wanted to see what I could do as much as I did, and now you want it to stop. It's over. Goodbye. I found a tape of a conversation my father had with a man named Sylar. A man he believed was patient zero. Come here, you. Mohinder, this is Mohinder. Want to give him a kiss? There you go. What is it? It's a portable hard drive. My, God, he did it. He actually came up with a way to find them. You wondered why someone would want to kill my father. The reason for his death, it's this. I'm going to finish what he started. Hey, Parkman, how the hell did you know that little girl was in there? I don't know. I don't know. I heard her whispering, and... House full of cops but you're outside and you just heard her whisper? I can't explain it. It was... I thought everybody could hear her. You guys couldn't hear her? You got someplace better to be? It's my wife. I'm meeting her at a... A therapy session. Couples counseling. We're having some problems at home. This guy's worthless. ...worthless. Cut him loose. He got lucky. Not yet, Parkman. Your captain says you've taken the exam to advance to detective three times. Right. You really think you're detective material? Yes ma'am, I do. So, how does it make you feel, flunking out so many times? Embarrassed, I guess. A little angry. A little angry? Yeah. Angry enough to do something about it? Maybe set yourself up to look like a hero? Wait, you think I killed these people? I didn't kill these people. Sylar did. How did you know that name? Six people assigned to this case know the name Sylar. How the hell did you know that? I heard it. From you. Like you heard the girl whisper. Yeah. Then hear this one. You're under arrest. What? Claire Bear. Hi, Dad. Hey. How was school? Very school-like. How was work? Very work-like. Listen, I... I made a couple of calls today. I spoke to a very nice woman at the adoption agency, and she said they were going to try to get in touch with your birth parents and request a meeting. I thought that was an adult decision. Well, you seemed pretty adult this morning when you told me you wanted to do it. Thanks. She said it was a lengthy process, and it could take weeks. I'm hoping years. That way you'll be my little girl for a while longer. I'm not done protecting you from the world. You're my dad. You'll never not be my dad. I promise I'll be your little girl for as long as I can. But you can't protect me forever. I know. And it breaks my heart. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, sweetheart. Go get ready for dinner. This is Claire Bennet, and that was attempt number six. It really does break my heart. I've been looking all over for you. Did you know about Dad's depression? Yeah. Why didn't you ever tell me? Because everyone is entitled to their secrets, Peter. I was so sure when it happened. Now it turns out I'm just going crazy. Look, we've been through this before. We've played this game, okay? Let's just... Let's just go. Tell me what happened, Nathan. When I jumped. Tell me you flew. I wanna hear you say that you flew. Tell me or I'll jump again. Good luck on your campaign when I'm splattered all over the ground below. All right. You want the truth? Yeah. We both flew, Pete. I caught you and I lost control. You're too heavy. We both started falling to the ground, and just before we... Just before we hit, you flew. You. Are you lying to me? You are. You're trying to tell me what you think I want to hear. You're lying to me again! Did you see that? Did you see that, that I flew? I can't... Shh. I know. I know. You're one sick son of a bitch, you know that? Very sorry. I not to speak much English. What I want to know is what did you do with the man's brain? Did you flush it down the toilet? Did you eat it? What? We've got a live one here. No English, no passport, no American money, no lD, except for this here, an honorary member of the Merry Marvel Marching Society. Let's start by asking him how he got to New York. He says he teleported himself here. Teleported? What the hell is that? Like Star Trek. He says he can bend the space-time continuum. Funny, I've seen all the Star Treks. I don't remember you from the show. How long ago did he do this? Yesterday. Hiro? New York. Yeah, yeah. Your friend says he was with you yesterday. Yesterday? That's not correct? I have not seen Hiro Nakamura in five weeks. We looked for him everywhere. His buddy hasn't seen him for five weeks. October 2. October 2? No, pal. Today November 8. November? No. October. For all his bluster, it is the sad province of man that he cannot choose his triumph. He can only choose how he will stand when the call of destiny comes, hoping that he'll have the courage to answer.
