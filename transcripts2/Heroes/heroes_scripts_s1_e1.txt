 - - Where does it come from? This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries, when the simplest of questions can never be answered? Why are we here? What is the soul?  Why do we dream? Perhaps we'd be better off not looking at all. Not delving, not yearning. That's not human nature. Not the human heart. That is not why we are here. How's he doing? l'm sorry. Did l scare you? No.

 No, l just. . . l keep having these amazing dreams every time l cIose my eyes, and. . . Never mind. He Iikes me to read him the stock page. Has he been conscious at aII? No. Been a week now. l think he's cIose. A coupIe more days, maybe. Excuse me. You know, l don't know what he'd do without you. You got a reaI gift. Just doing my job. No, you're Iike a son to him.

 Yeah. No, reaIIy, it's okay. l need to change his lV. l'm sorry, of course. Man is a narcissistic species by nature. We have coIonized the four corners of our tiny pIanet. But we are not the pinnacIe of so-caIIed evoIution. That honor beIongs to the IowIy cockroach. CapabIe of Iiving for months without food. Remaining aIive headIess for weeks at a time. Resistant to radiation. lf God has indeed created himseIf in his own image, then l submit to you that God is a cockroach. They say that man uses onIy a tenth of his brainpower. Another percent and we might actuaIIy be worthy of God's image. UnIess, of course, that day has aIready arrived. The Human Genome Project has discovered that tiny variations in man's genetic code are taking pIace at increasingIy rapid rates. TeIeportation, Ievitation, tissue regeneration. ls this outside the reaIm of possibiIity? Or is man entering a new gateway to evoIution? ls he finaIIy standing at the threshoId to true human potentiaI? l'm sorry, l'm out of time. l know, l know. l'm beginning to sound Iike my father. l can't heIp it. You know, they can fire me, too, if they Iike, but there is something to it, Nirad, as crazy as it sounds. What is it? lt's your father. He's dead. How? Driving a taxi in New York City is a very dangerous job. The wrong fare, the wrong time. We may never know what reaIIy happened. No, l spoke to him two days ago. He was convinced someone was foIIowing him, trying to steaI his research. He died because of his theories! That's crazy! ls it? The man Ieft his famiIy, discredited his career, to chase wiId theories haIfway around the worId! Where are you going? To his apartment, to get his papers, his research! He was this cIose to finding the first of them. His Patient Zero, he tracked him to Queens, New York. Mohinder, Iisten to me. Your father was my coIIeague and my friend. A respected professor, a briIIiant geneticist. But he had cIearIy Iost touch with reaIity! l've foIIowed in his footsteps. My thesis is based on his research! Yes, you aIways wanted his approvaI! And now you're teIIing me that it was aII for nothing. l'm teIIing you to Iet go. l need to know why he died. l need to know that it wasn't aII for nothing. And then l need to finish what he started. HeIIo? Yeah, yeah, l'm at his pIace now. No, no, no, he Ieft everything behind but his computer. Research, the map. Yeah, Iet's get a team in here to bag and tag everything. l gotta caII you right back. Pervert. Time to get up, Micah! Micah! Micah ! Micah! What? Damn it, Micah, don't do that to me. Do what? Just you need to be carefuI. AII right? l'm just working on my computer. The Iogic board was bad, so l had to buiId a new one. A new one. Did anyone ever teII you you're the smartest IittIe man on the pIanet? You do. AII the time. What's this? lt's a pinhoIe camera. lt's for the ecIipse. The moon's gonna cover up the sun today. We're supposed to Iook at it at schooI. Speaking of which, you need to go get ready. Can't be Iate, not today. Mom, l'm aIready dressed and l've packed my own Iunch. That's what l've been doing this morning. What about you? Don't get smart with me. AII right, l've been working to pay our biIIs. Yeah, that's why they turned off our gas again? Go grab your stuff and wait by the back door, okay? Why? Just do it. Mom, what's going on? Never mind, just keep your voice down and stay cIose to me. Camera ready? Yeah, aImost! HoId on! This Iooks Iike 70, 80 feet. This is so unreaI. Okay, l'm good! Okay. Oh my. .. Oh, my God. Oh, my God ! CIaire? Oh, my God. CIaire! This is CIaire Bennet and that was attempt number six. You get out here, yes? Mr. Linderman, l'm gonna have to caII you back in five minutes, okay? Thank you. l'm Iate. l've got a fundraiser and a drinks meeting. What is it? lt happened two more times. Sometimes l'm faIIing, sometimes l'm fIying. Sometimes you're in 'em. l don't have time for this now. They're not just dreams, Nathan! HoId this. l thought they'd go away, but they're not! Jim, l need this back by 6:00, pIease. Thanks. This morning when l got out of bed, my foot hovered before it hit the ground. Hovered! For a spIit second, Iike l was fIoating. l'm teIIing you, l think l can fIy! These aII undecideds? Mmm-hmm. TeII you what, you think you can fIy? Why don't you jump off the BrookIyn Bridge? See what happens. Maybe l ought to start with something a IittIe Iower first. Just Iike Iearning to waIk. You're serious. Oh, l'm serious. You need to snap out of it, Peter. Go see a doctor, get some drugs. But do not puII a Roger CIinton on me, man, l'm eight points down in the poIIs! Look, this isn't about you, aII right? Look, something is happening to me, and l have this feeIing that you're the onIy person that's gonna understand this! Why the heII wouId l understand that you think you can fIy? Because you're my brother! Mom, l can't taIk. .. What? l'II be there in 1 0 minutes. What'd she do now? She got arrested. Arrested for what? ShopIifting. l'm so depressed. What? What are you taIking about? Why? l mean, l mean, besides the fact that it was so gross that l aImost fudged myseIf, this is the singIe cooIest thing to happen to this town in, Iike, 1 00 years. Not if nobody finds out, it's not. Why'd you want me to tape it? l have my reasons. lt's not Iike you're not gonna be popuIar anymore. PopuIar? Who said anything about being popuIar? My Iife as l know it is over, okay? l've got the Bishop game next week, SAT's in October, Homecoming's three weeks from today, and l'm a freak show! You're being a IittIe dramatic, don't you think? No, l don't think! l have busted, Iike, every bone in my body, stabbed myseIf in the chest, l've shoved a two-foot steeI rod through my neck, and l don't have a scratch on me! What do you caII that thing sticking out? Oh, great. Just give me the tape, okay? Sure. Hey, l can give you a ride on my handIebars if you want. Look, thanks, okay? l'II taIk to you in front of peopIe at schooI tomorrow. Promise. Your son is a very inteIIigent boy. Gifted, actuaIIy. That's not the issue. His father's not around, and sometimes l think he couId use a bit of a stronger hand, you know? l work nights a Iot, but we can both work harder. lt's not about the work. The truth is, l just don't know if this schooI is the right fit for him. But he's made friends. l'm sorry. He's on the soccer team. l'm sorry. l wrote a check for $25,000 to get him into this snob fest. l was toId that that's what it took. That's on top of the tuition. About the tuition. Your Iast three checks have bounced. Fine, take it out of the 25 grand that l gave you. That was a donation. And it was very appreciated. WeII, l want my money back. l want my money back, now. That money went to the capitaI campaign for the new wing. lt's aIready been spent. Then unspend it! l'm sorry. We couId maybe discuss an extension of the money that you owe, but. .. l want my money back. That's not possibIe. Come on, baby, Iet's get out of here. You're too good for this Iousy schooI. Mom? Leave me aIone! For God's sake, Ma. Are you okay? They dropped the charges. l have to fiII out a form. No big deaI. No big deaI? l'm running for Congress. Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to me if it gets out, with our famiIy's past? What couId you possibIy need so bad that you had to steaI it? Never mind, l don't wanna know. Socks. Socks? Dad Ieft you a fortune. What are you thinking? You know, it's been one ridicuIous stunt after another with you for the Iast six months! Dad's gone, just get over it! You know what? Leave her aIone! She's okay, that's aII that matters. l gotta keep this out of the press. You know what? Just get out of here. Go worry about your image, l'II handIe this. Yeah. Good. l gotta make sure this stays buried. Thanks a Iot, Mom. Mmm-hmm. What were you thinking? l just wanted to feeI aIive again. Nathan onIy cares about himseIf. Your father was the same way. AIpha dogs, both of them. You, in the meantime, for aII your seIfIessness, and sitting with dying peopIe. .. What? You're gonna retire on what you make? Maybe l'II shopIift my socks. Don't get smart. When you put everyone eIse first, you end up Iast. You aIways put Nathan first, he took advantage. Yeah, it wasn't you that was just pushing him right out in front of me? He takes up more space than you. Demanded more attention. And besides, it's not my fauIt, you aIIowed it. He's my brother. l Iove him. Ah, Iove is overrated. He Ioves me, too. l know him. We've aIways been cIose. Rose-coIored gIasses. That's crueI, Mom! Look, since Dad died, l know you've been feeIing free to speak your mind, but it wouIdn't hurt to edit yourseIf every once in a whiIe. l'm sorry if the truth hurts. l'm just saying you hero-worshipped him. And those feeIings were never returned. You're wrong! lt's bioIogicaI, and l can't heIp it, we're connected. l never toId you this, but when Nathan had his accident, l knew it. We aII got the same caII. No, l'm saying before the caII, Iike he was teIIing me, 300 miIes away. l woke up, and l knew that he'd been hurt. l hate it here. She doesn't even have any books to read. Baby, l'II be right back, l'm just gonna go and pack up a few things. We shouId reaIIy go see Dad. What good wouId that do? He couId heIp. He shouId know that someone's trying to hurt us. Your dad's not in any position to heIp us right now. Look, l made some mistakes, l admit it. Mom, what'd you do? Hey. l need you to know that l wouId never Iet anything happen to you. Promise. Mom, why'd you Iook at yourseIf Iike that in the fish tank? How Iong? Just a coupIe hours, tops. There's some ice cream in the fridge. Go ahead. What happened? l went to see Linderman. How much? Thirty. You gambIing again? No, it's just biIIs. And l used the rest to get Micah into private schooI. They didn't know what to do with him at pubIic, and l just. .. l needed them to think that we had money. From the mob? HeII, Niki. You weren't born yesterday! l'm just two weeks overdue! l mean, l thought that l couId handIe it, okay? l'm under a Iot of stress right now, okay? Gee, l wonder why? l feeI Iike l'm kind of Iosing it a IittIe bit. l'm seeing things. Like? Like l keep feeIing Iike someone's watching me. Yeah, Linderman wants his money back, so he sends some mouth-breather that's gonna put you in the hospitaI. No, it is someone eIse. lt's someone that l can't see. Does this make any sense to you? No. l'm sorry, you know what? But l'II teII you what does. .. l shouIdn't be teIIing you this. No, no, Iet me teII you what does make sense. You need to come up with that 30 grand pIus interest, now. Or you gotta run. Watch him. AII right. CooI, huh? How hot do you think it is in there? Turn on the camera. Scotty! Scotty! Come on! Take it easy, you're aII right! l'm okay, l'm fine! Take it easy. There's no burns! Get going! One, two, three, four, five, go! One, two, three. .. Yeah, l was reaI sorry to hear about your father. He seemed Iike a good guy. Man, l thought l was a sIob. They were here, too. What? Nothing. l got a guy who can cIean this up for 1 00 bucks. No. lt's aII right. l'II take it as it is.

An unidentified Good Samaritan who witnesses describe as a young teenage girl ran into the flames and rescued the young lieutenant.

But judging by the amount of security around here... lt wasn't easy, Nathan, but consider it gone. l know l owe you big on this one, Tom. l'm not gonna forget it. Yeah, l won't let you forget it. Thanks. Sure thing. Mom's rap sheet is now officiaIIy buried. lt onIy took haIf my poIiticaI capitaI to puII it off. Why can't she get herseIf a hobby Iike a normaI person? They were married 41 years. lt's a pIea for attention. She's IoneIy.

No, l'm not taIking about what you do, l'm taIking about who you are. l'm taIking about being speciaI. Yes, we are aII speciaI. That's not what l meant. Some individuaIs, it is true, are more speciaI. This is naturaI seIection. lt begins as a singIe individuaI born or hatched Iike every other member of their species, anonymous, seemingIy ordinary, except they're not. They carry inside them the genetic code that wiII take their species to the next evoIutionary rung. lt's destiny. Hey! Hey, l can't beIieve you just Ieft Iike that! Yeah, l know, l was there.

What's the probIem, baby? l said, what's the matter? Screw you. Screw me? - Hi, this is Niki. - Leave me a message. Mom, are you there? When are you coming to get me? l hate it here. You said you'd be back soon. Just come pick me up, okay? - HeIIo? - Peter, it's me. Hey! Simone? Are you busy? No, l was just heading home. Listen, l need you to meet me at my dad's.

There was a Professor Suresh at the University of Madras, a geneticist. lnteresting theories. Don't think he's teaching anymore. But you wouIdn't know anything about that, wouId you? ProbabIy Iots of Sureshes where you're from. Like Smith or Anderson. And then CarIa had the nerve to teII me he's not breed-worthy. Like he didn't win five aII-breed raIIies, two regionaIs. Can you beIieve it? lt's just not true, Mr. MuggIes. lt's not true. He's a IittIe stud muffin, that's what he is. He stiII humps my Ieg when l watch TV. AII right, enough about Mr. MuggIes. What'd everybody eIse do today? Doug and l saw this Mexican guy. A homeIess dude, on our way to schooI. We thought he was dead, but he wasn't. l thought Dad was coming home today. WeII, ah, l was gonna surprise you. He finished up earIy, he's coming home tonight. lsn't that great? Just in time to read my report card. So what about you, CIaire, do anything speciaI today? l waIked through fire and l didn't get burned. What the heII is that supposed to mean? God, you're so crazy sometimes. LyIe. l think l know exactIy what you mean. Oh, here l am, taIking dogs again. And you go and say something reaIIy profound. We come up against aII kinds of fires in our Iives, and when we test ourseIves and face our fears, we usuaIIy don't get burned. You are very wise, sweetheart. Whatever it is you did, l'm proud of you. And so is Mr. MuggIes! He's just so proud of CIaire! Aren't we? We're proud of CIaire. Yes, we're so proud of CIaire, aren't we? She's the best. Hiro. What are you Iooking for? Morphine. What for? l need you to come with me somepIace. Where? You'II see. Look, there's. .. There's something l need to teII you. Now that is gonna have to wait. No, Iook, l need to teII you about this, okay? l've gotta stop Iiving for other peopIe. My whoIe Iife l've had no idea what l'm supposed to do, what l'm supposed to be, if l even have a destiny of my own! l promise you we wiII taIk about this Iater, okay? But right now l reaIIy need you to come with me. You're a nurse, you can give out a shot, you can heIp him.

No buts. l just wanted to teII you that. l know you think l'm trying to be your best friend again, admit it. No. lt's aII right, we can go to the movies together. lt's no big deaI. l just miss you, that's aII. l wanna be your mom, l wanna give you advice. But l don't wanna push you away. l want advice, l do. l won't push you away, l promise. l just don't think you shouId be so worried about fitting in aII the time. About being so popuIar. l don't want to see you make mistakes Iike l did. l wanted to be someone more interesting than l am. You are interesting. You breed show dogs. Whose mom does that? No, l wanted to hitchhike across Europe. Study art. FaII in Iove with some poetry-quoting Frenchman. Not that your dad isn't wonderfuI, but my point is, you shouId know who you are and know that it's enough. 'Cause who you are is speciaI. About that. There's something l need to say. Something l never taIked about 'cause l thought it wouId upset you and Dad. Sweetheart, you can say anything to us, you know that. l think l'm oId enough for you to teII me who my reaI parents are. Of course you are. Honey! l'm home! Your father. Hey, honey! Bad, Mr. MuggIes! No! l'm gIad you're home. Oh, me, too. l have such a headache. l sIammed my head getting out of a taxicab. Hi, Daddy! Hey, baby! HeIIo, New York! l'm just saying it's impossibIe. Nobody can predict the future. l saw it with my own eyes, Peter. lsaac! l brought someone here to heIp. He's a nurse. lsaac. lsaac? lsaac!

No, no, he's conscious. Just bareIy. l know. Listen, couId you just come? Get here soon, pIease. Okay, baby, it's okay, they're sending an ambuIance right now, okay? You just hang in there, okay? You're gonna be okay, l swear. We have to stop it. - Oh, baby. - We have to stop it. This quest, this need to solve life's mysteries. ln the end, what does it matter when the human heart can only find meaning in the smallest of moments? They're here among us. ln the shadows, in the light. Everywhere. Do they even know yet? AII right, l'm here. Now what do you want? Peter? l've been up here aII night thinking about this. Thinking about my destiny. What are you doing, Pete? lt's my turn to be somebody now, Nathan! Come on, Peter, quit screwing around! Peter! You're fIying, Nathan. You're fIying.
