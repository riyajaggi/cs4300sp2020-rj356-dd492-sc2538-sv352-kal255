 Welcome to AAA
or All Addictions Anonymous,
 but we fix your addiction problems
not your auto problems. Ha-ha!
 What about...
[sniffs]
 auto-erotic asphyxiation?
[sniffs]
 You're good, Gary.
Please put your pants on.
 - Now, who'd like to begin?
- My name is Bullet, and...
 Go ahead, Bullet. This dirty basement
full of shivering junkies and sex freaks
 is a safe place.
 All right, well, Mr. Sponsor,
 honestly, life without drugs...
 It's boring and it's unfulfilling.
 I mean, last night I watched Ballers.
 Fucking Ballers!
 Oh, dear God!
 I'm at rock bottom.
 And I did a mix of crack, bath salts
 and 13 liquefied Slim Jims.
 Oh, the old hillbilly highball.
 Yep, that's the one.
It sent me into a rage.
 I think I even ripped
some poor old woman's face off.
 That's horrible. When did this happen?
 About a half hour ago. Right, Pam?
 Yeah, about a half hour.
 Well, I think someone deserves
his 30-minute sober chip.
 [applauding]
 Hey, man, I think I have something
 to aid in bringing that excitement
back into your life.
 That's great! What is it?
 Like alternative therapy or hypnosis,
holistic medicines?
 Nope, a big old bag of meth.
 Anyone ever tell you
you're a really shitty sponsor?
 [Gary muttering]
 Hey, Gary. Suicide or jerking off?
 - [Gary] I'm jerking off.
- You know, I can never tell
 if he's coming or going.
 [grunts]
 [gunshots]
 [firing]
 [grunts]
 [shouts]
 Kids, we have a very special treat.
An officer from the Paradise PD
 is here to teach us
about good touch, bad touch.
 [door slams open]
Hi, kids!
 I'm Lustall the Sex Crime Dog!
 I'm here to teach you how to keep
bad people's paws off your wee-wees,
 your vee-gees or your tee-tees.
 So never leave home
without your Bad Touch stickers.
 [all gasp]
 And be careful, kids,
 because...
 ♪ Everyone you know is a molester ♪
 ♪ If they're Caucasian or they're Asian
Or they're black ♪
 ♪ Even sweet old Dr. Becker ♪
 ♪ Wants to check your little pecker ♪
 ♪ And Roy the plumber
Wants to cop your crack ♪
 ♪ 'Cause everyone on Earth is a molester ♪
 ♪ Don't let them touch you
Here or here or here ♪
 ♪ I bet even Mrs. Horne ♪
 ♪ Has a stash of kiddie porn ♪
 ♪ You're not safe
Unless you live your life in fear ♪
 All right, let's go!
Kevin, what the hell were you thinking?
 I'm tired of arresting you
every time you speak to children.
 Dad, this wouldn't have happened
 if you'd give me
a real police assignment.
 Maybe you are ready.
 You were right about
all that kiddie porn
 we found on Mrs. Horne's laptop,
that dirty bitch.
 What the hell do you think
you're wearing, Kevin?
 A dog suit? Really?
 Did you ever stop and think
that maybe that's offensive to dogs?
 That's like blackface to us!
 Didn't you wear blackface
to the Halloween party?
 Our people can do that, Fitz.
I'm 132nd pit bull,
 which everyone knows is a black dog.
 That's a stereotype.
 Wait. Don't you own a pit bull?
 Hell, yeah, I own a pit bull.
 I got black neighbors.
What the fuck you think?
 Also, I bought this from my AAA sponsor.
 [Bullet] I'm really getting mixed messages
at that place.
 Argyle meth?
 What's that stuff
still doing on the street?
 That's weird. Terry Two-Toes is dead.
 Anyone else think it's also weird
 that Terry Two-Toes shot himself
in jail with no access to a gun
 and the security tape went missing?
 Argh! What are you,
some kind of conspiracy nut?
 Next you'll tell me
thatyou're one of those Round-Earthers.
 You heard Shaq.
 The world is flat.
 So's my police horse.
 May he rest in peace.
 - Gina, dust this for prints.
- Yes, sir!
 I'll dust the dick off this bag, sir!
 There's no fingerprints.
 But there is one flipper print.
 Flipper print? That means it can only be
one of two people.
 Frank Flipper-Fist, the drug-dealing,
dog-fighting criminal,
 or Edna Dorsal-Digits,
 the sweet old lady
who plays the organ in church.
 I can't believe there's only
two flipper people in this inbred town.
 There used to be a lot more.
 Yeah, we had a dolphin at the zoo
for a few years
 and things got weird.
 People fucked the dolphin,
if you get my drift.
 Listen, Dad, dog fighting is perfect.
 I'll take Bullet and we'll go undercover.
 Are you crazy? I'm not dog fighting.
That sounds dangerous!
 Bullet, it's not dangerous.
 It's just like professional wrestling.
 You're a huge wrestling fan.
 Well, that is true.
 Even though my heroes' careers
usually end in tragedy.
 I mean, Macho Man - car accident.
 Owen Hart - tragic fall.
 The Rock - Ballers.
 I mean, seriously, nobody asked for
black Entourage. Nobody!
 Bullet, I can help you.
I trained Joe Louis.
 You taught Joe Louis how to box?
 No, I trained him.
 I was in his whistle hole
and my buddy was in his caboose.
 Uh...
 I don't think I need your help.
 You sure?
I can teach you how to take a blow.
 [whispers] I think it's time
to put him down.
 Dad, can we dog fight, please?
 Let me show you I can do this.
 Okay, fine.
 If it'll get you off my empty sack
for five minutes,
 I'll grab the Flipper-Fist file
from my office.
 [Dean] What the shit?
 It's those Diamond City cops.
 Another one of their stupid pranks!
 I'm kind of new to Cousin-Fucker County.
Fill me in.
 They're a bunch of rich sack-slappers
from the next town over.
 I wanna cock stomp every one of them.
 I went to the academy with their chief,
guy named Hancock.
 We were friends, then he took away a woman
that meant a lot to me and married her.
 He's been rubbing it in my face
 by pulling these bullshit pranks on me
ever since.
 I don't do pranks, IKEA, or cargo pants.
 - That's all white people's shit.
- [phone beeps]
 [laughs] Shit! Michael Bublé's playing
at the Bandshell.
 Who wants to see some Bublé?
 I have had enough of this crap!
 We are gonna take a trip
to Diamond City
 and we are gonna teach
Chief Hancock a lesson!
 Uh... should we get Stanley down first?
 Hopson, how the hell
did you get up there?
 I don't know.
 Last time I was in a mess this sticky
 was when I taught Jack Dempsey
how to work the bag.
 And he came in my face.
 Hancock! I have had it up to here
with your goddamn pranks!
 What, you're still mad
that I was eating your wife
 and sucking them titties before you were?
 Hello, Randall.
 I see you're still upset that I married
your mother.
 - Well, this shit just got weird.
- Hi, Grandpa.
 Don't call him that!
 Randall, I can assure you
 that this department doesn't have time
for pranks.
 We're too busy doing real police work.
 Governor, please continue.
 On behalf of the President, it is my honor
to present Diamond City Police Department
 with this award.
 [softly] Of course it was me
that glued all your shit to the ceiling.
 Gotcha!
 Also, I never loved your mother.
 I've just been racking that grease pit
of hers for the past 30 years
 to fuck with you.
 - Double gotcha!
- What?
 Hancock, I am gonna kick your ass!
 [roaring]
 [Dispatcher 1] One-eighty-seven reported.
All Diamond City units please respond.
 Copy that. We'll have to
settle this later, Crawford.
 [Dispatcher 2] Chief! Oh, Chief! Chief!
 - Come in, Chief! Hello?
- [grunts]
 Are you there? Are you there?
 Are you there, Chief? Are you there?
 Chief, are you there?
 Yes! Dusty, what the hell is it?
 [Dusty] We got a 911 call
about a homo inside Paradise.
 Dusty, I'm sure they said
"homicide in Paradise."
 Oh! That's a relief!
 False alarm, everybody.
Y'all can go back to church now.
 [siren wails]
 What the hell are you Diamond City dicks
doing at my crime scene?
 Your crime scene?
 This is obviously
Diamond City's jurisdiction.
 Actually, Chief Limpcock, it looks like
the body is laying right on the line
 between Paradise and Diamond City.
 In that case, the only fair thing to do
is divide the evidence
 by what's actually
in each of our city's jurisdictions.
 Sounds good to me. We'll see who IDs
this victim and solves the crime first.
 You're on.
 Oh, looks like we have the victim's face,
 fingerprints, dental records,
and you have...
 ...the ass.
 Ugh, shit!
 Here we are, Bullet.
 The dog fighting ring.
Our first undercover mission together.
 - You ready?
- Yeah.
 But why am I the only dog
taking it seriously?
 Maybe it's laundry day.
 [dogs barking]
 But this isn't like pro wrestling!
 You lied to me!
 You wouldn't have come if I didn't.
But I promise we'll be out of here
 before you even have to fight.
 All right, you're next.
 [cheering]
 - Kevin!
- My dog's not supposed to be in there.
 He's not a fighting dog.
 Then why's he wearing that pink cape
that says "I'm a fighting dog"?
 [barking]
 [dog whimpers]
 [cheering]
 We have a Frank Flipper Fist Fighting
 winner!
 Why are you trying to touch me
like that?
 - I'm gonna raise your hand in triumph.
- No, you know what? I got this.
 Don't worry. All good. I can do it myself.
 Bullet!
[laughs]
 What a match!
 I've never seen a dog fight like that.
 The crowd loved it.
I'm gonna make you a star!
 Thanks, but I don't think
Bullet will be fighting any more.
 [laughs]
 He's kidding.
Of course I'll keep fighting.
 That's great!
 Let's celebrate.
 These are the finest Cubans money can buy.
 [giggles] Almost got it here.
 [sighs, stammering]
 [speaking gibberish]
 All right.
[chuckles]
 It's a little tricky.
 [speaking gibberish]
 [chuckles]
 Just...
 Come on!
 [growls]
 Fucking piece of shit defective lighters!
 [chuckles]
 I've got something better for you boys.
I'll be right back.
 - Are you think what I'm thinking?
- Yeah.
 - How does he crank off with those things?
- No!
 - What are you doing?
- Looking for Argyle meth.
 That's why we're here! Remember?
Why did you tell that fishy-finned freak
 - you'd keep fighting?
- You saw me out there. I was awesome!
 Stop it, Bullet.
You could get hurt or killed.
 Oh, now look who's worried about me!
You know what? Don't be.
 The last thing these idiot dogs expect
are my sweet '80s wrestling moves.
 - I am going to dominate these bitches!
- So you're Bullet the Badass now?
 No, don't be an asshole, Kevin.
Actually, wait...
 Bullet the Badass...
Can I use that, for serious?
 - It's a pretty fucking sweet name.
- [door closes]
 35-year-old Scotch.
 I've been saving this
for a special occasion.
 Ah!
 Okay, here you are.
 Sorry, I'm 30 minutes sober.
 I respect that.
 What do you think?
 [vomits]
 Sorry, I got my tongue
all over your desk.
 How are we supposed to solve this
case using only an ass?
 There are two things I never question.
 The creepy little Asian girl that whispers
commands in my head and the Chief.
 All right. If we're even gonna have
a chance of beating Diamond City,
 we have to take this case seriously.
 I know you'll be tempted to make
a bunch of stupid ass puns...
 I'm guessing whoever killed him
was silent but deadly.
 - Fitz!
- I hope this evidence
 ain't been tainted!
 Yeah, very funny. Cut it out.
 Something about this case stinks.
 I don't know if we can crack it,
but duty calls.
 Get it? Butt duty? [laughs]
 Enough! It's time to get serious
and find out what wiped this asshole out.
 Goddamn it!
Now you got me doing it.
 [clicks]
 [shutter click continues]
 Hmm.
 [sniffs]
 Fourteen, 15, 16.
 Sixteen wrinkles on right hemisphere.
 - One, two, three...
- Back up, Chief.
 That stink-eye gonna give you pink eye.
 We joke about this, kids,
but remember,
 never put your eyeball
directly on a booty hole.
 Have you seen this asshole?
 Ugh! No!
 How about you? You seen this asshole?
 [vomits]
 Shit! We don't have a single lead.
 Dusty, pull your pants up.
I can see your assho...
 Wait a minute!
 This asshole is at least 65% lighter
than your asshole.
 The victim had his asshole bleached.
 Yeah, and that looks
real professional too.
 Probably went down
to Banzai Butthole Bleaching.
 Open noon to 4 p.m.
every day of the year but Christmas.
 I probably shouldn't ask,
but how do you know that?
 Because I get my cat's butthole bleached
every Tuesday.
 She was walking around one day,
flipped her tail up at me
 and that thing just looked evil.
It was dark,
 like the brown eye of Sauron
or something.
 I tried to bleach it at home myself,
to be thrifty,
 and I used Clorox, but I ended up
melting my cat's butthole shut.
 Trick's on me, 'cause that cat butthole
reconstructive surgery
 cost me way more than I saved,
 plus I had to teach her how to shit again
by holding her over the litter box
 and squeezing her little belly
like a Go-GURT
 till her butthole opened back up.
But it kept healing shut,
 so I had to take both thumbs
and a pair of chopsticks
 and pry it open. That's how I got
these scratch marks on my face.
 Yes, I get it, Dusty!
 [crowd cheering]
 Electricity fills the air
 as this crowd awaits the new sensation
 that has made dog fighting exciting again.
 - Delbert, are you as charged up as I am?
- Yeah.
 Okay, well, here he is, folks.
The canine crusher,
 the puppy paralyzer,
 Bullet the Badass!
 [chanting]
Bullet the Badass!
 [crowd cheering]
 [dogs whimpering]
 Yeah!
 Bullet climbed up on the top rope.
 Oh, my God!
Is he gonna do his signature move?
 - Yes, he is!
- [unzips]
 It's time to apply...
 the lipstick!
 [door opens]
 Hi, my name is Billy Brownstar.
 Just a regular guy
here to get my stink-hole bleached.
 There have been a lot of complaints.
 Can you make it look like
Angelina Jolie sucking a lemon?
 - [kisses]
- Oh, you want a number four?
 Oh, just one thing
before you Clorox my dirt box.
 I've been looking for a friend of mine.
 Is this asshole one of your customers?
 - Why do you have that? Are you a cop?
- No, I'm not a cop.
 My name is... Donnie Doodyhole.
 Get your purple asshole out of here!
 I'm not going anywhere.
 Wait. It's purple?
 Ow!
 You anal bleached my eyes!
 [sobs]
 Who can spare a hamburger?
 You got a hamburger?
I love hamburgers.
 [door opens]
 God damn, Chief!
What happened to your eyes?
 You look like you got teabagged
by a birthday clown.
 [scoffs] I wish!
 Some Asian lady tried to blind me
with anal bleach.
 [chuckles] Damn, you kinky, Chief!
 Chief, have you been up all night?
 How can you tell?
I don't see any dark circles.
 [cackles]
 As a matter of fact, yes,
I have been up all night.
 I've been working on this.
 [chuckles] This is getting
a little crazy, Chief.
 - Maybe we should inform the Mayor.
- No, do not tell Karen.
 She's still pissed off at me
for standing her up on that date.
 All because I ran out
of testosterone patches.
 And your mustache fell out.
 And you grew them big old titties.
[laughs]
 My dick was very confused.
 But, Chief, why is this ass case
so important to you?
 It can't just be about Diamond Shitty.
 I've never talked about it,
 but I've been in this situation before.
 It was 1985.
 I was handed a Jane Doe severed ass case.
 Just an ass. No legs, no body.
 Nothing but ass.
 I became obsessed with solving the case.
 It was all I could think about.
Months went by with no leads
 and it drove me into madness.
 Ass madness.
 [butt] You're a shitty cop, Crawford.
 No ifs, ands or butts!
[laughs]
 See what I did there?
 [laughing hysterically]
 Ass puns! No!
 I never found out
who that ass belonged to.
 I descended into a dark place
where the sun don't shine.
 That cold case haunts me to this day.
 And yeah, I confess
that isn't a sunset on these patches.
 It is a puckering butthole.
 It's a tribute to her.
 But I'm not going to let
history repeat itself.
 Excuse me, I've got work to do.
 [high-pitched voice]
You'll never figure out my secret!
 Yes, I will.
 [high-pitched voice]
No, you won't!
 Okay, he's losing his damn mind.
 - We gotta tell the Mayor about this.
- You heard the Chief.
 We can't tell her!
He gave us a direct order.
 Sometimes a good soldier's gotta know
when not to follow orders.
 [high-pitched voice]
I've been a bad butthole!
 Somebody spank me.
 Hey, guys, I think I'm onto something.
 [high-pitched laughing]
 - Ah, you wanted to see me?
- Ah, yes. Come in.
 I was just about to eat this sushi
with chopsticks
 and finish this model ship in a bottle.
 So your boy has
his championship fight tonight, eh?
 [laughs]
We should have a drink for good luck.
 Dear God, no.
 But do you have anything stronger
and less dangerous?
 Say... Argyle meth?
 Hell, no! I wouldn't keep that
around dogs.
 That stuff's got chocolate in it.
It's inhumane!
 Really? Wow. Guess I'll be going now.
 Wait a minute. Hold on.
I've got a proposition for you.
 Bring me more dogs like Bullet.
 We bet against them and get rich.
 Why would we bet against Bullet?
He's undefeated.
 That's because I sedated
every dog he fought.
 Make everyone think he's a winner.
 But tonight,
in the big championship fight,
 he's going to get killed.
 Literally! What do you say, partner?
You supply the wussy dogs,
 and do you know how many millions
we could make?
 This many!
 - [cackles]
- Uh...
 One-weird-flappy-million
that smells like fish?
 No, four! Can't you count? Look.
One, two, three, four.
 Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go crank off.
 I use my feet, by the way.
 Come on, buddy. Talk to me.
 Please!
 Open up for me. Let me in.
 Who am I kidding? I suck!
 I'll never get a break in this case.
 - [phone ringing]
- Ah!
 Holy crap! That's coming from...
 inside the ass.
 It's times like this I wish I hadn't
slashed our rubber glove budget.
 Happy place. Go to my happy place.
Happy place.
 [ringing]
 - Hello?
- [man] The mole has the answer.
 The mole? Who is the mole?
 [phone rings]
 [man] I'll never tell.
 Jesus! How many phones
are in this asshole?
 [phone rings]
 [man] Just three.
 Hey, Mr. Badass, excuse me.
 If it wouldn't be too much trouble,
could you sign my daughter's titties?
 Oh, and my son's boobies.
 He's transitioning and I titty-fuck...
I mean, support him.
 Bullet, we have to get out of here
right now!
 Slow down, dumb-dumb.
 I'm not going anywhere
until I win that championship.
 Plus, I got a lot of real gross body parts
to sign.
 The fights were all rigged in your favor.
If you fight tonight,
 you're gonna get killed!
 Bullshit! You lied to get me in here
and now you're lying to get me out.
 This is the first time
my life's been exciting without drugs.
 First time! And you know how much
I love drugs.
 But you don't give a shit about that!
You don't care at all.
 Everything's all about your stupid cases
and pleasing your daddy.
 Little pussy!
 We're getting out of here
whether you like it or not.
 [groans]
 Let me go, you dick! Get off!
Come on! Let go of me!
 It's fight time! Everything okay in here?
 No, Frank.
This asshole doesn't want me to fight.
 - Get him out of here.
- Gladly.
 [shrieks]
 And I thought I could trust you.
 Oh, well. Say goodbye.
 I just gotta...
Maybe with the other one, I...
 They make these triggers so small!
 Come on! It's broken!
 Let me see.
 [gunshot] Ah, good. Would you mind
shooting yourself for me?
 No, I'd rather not.
 - Some partner you are!
- [door slams shut]
 Who's the mole? Who's the mole?
 Maybe the Earth is round!
Maybe Shaq was wrong.
 Who is the mole?
 Randall, what the hell are you doing?
 Gina, why did you tell her?
I gave you a direct order.
 A good soldier's gotta know
when not to follow orders.
 Besides, I was worried about you.
 A little more now that I see you've
painted a 12-foot-tall fresco on the wall
 out of what appears to be
your own excrement.
 Randall, it took four years of
shock therapy to bring you back
 the last time you went down
this dark hole in '85.
 You're off this case for your own good.
 You can't do that, Karen!
I'm this close to solving this case.
 I just need to find who the mole is.
 Eureka, that's it!
 The mole's not a person!
 The mole is a mole!
 God damn! I've seen a lot of scat art,
and I've seen better, but not much.
 [crowd chanting]
Bullet the Badass!
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
underground dog fighting championship.
 Here he is, folks, live and unleashed -
Bullet the Badass!
 [cheering]
 [kisses]
 And his competition,
the gene-splice lab experiment,
 the genetically engineered killer,
 the fuck-you to God,
 half pit bull, half wolf,
 the pit wolf!
 [growling]
 Oh, look, the oldest trick in the book.
 Ow, ow! Shit! Time out!
 Oof.
 [pit wolf growls]
 - Kevin?
- Okay.
 Ah, ah, ah!
 [Kevin screaming]
 Hey, Bullet, how's that sobriety going?
 Great. Listen, real quick.
Can I buy some drugs from you?
 Sure. I'm your sponsor, right?
 I need crack, bath salts and 13 Slim Jims.
 One Hillbilly Highball coming up.
 Hey, keep the change.
 This isn't real money.
 [crowd cheering]
 [growls]
 [both growling]
 [all gasp]
 That's not a mole, that's writing.
It's a message.
 "Tri..."
 "Triple gotcha?"
 [laughing]
 I pranked you so hard!
 What? This is a prank? How?
 Yeah. We solved that murder
in five minutes,
 got rid of the body and I took its spot!
 It was worth
all the internal damage you did
 sticking your arm up my ass
looking for that cell phone
 just to see the look on your face!
 [laughs]
 You're the worst cop ever!
 You look so stupid right now!
 Hey, Kevin, sorry about that whole
ripping your face off thing.
 [sighs] Don't give it
a second thought, Bullet.
 Your heart was in the right place.
 Unfortunately, Kevin,
your heart won't be in the right place
 until after several more
invasive surgeries.
 And I'm touched that you sacrificed
your sobriety to try and save my life.
 Hey, that's what friends do.
 Besides, sobriety's overrated.
Wrestling's fun and all,
 - but it sure as shit ain't heroin.
- I just have one question.
 If that wasn't Frank Flipper-Fist's
flipper print on that Argyle meth,
 whose was it?
 Here you go, kids.
 First bag's free. Now scram!
 I gotta crank off.
 I use my feet, by the way.
 I use my good hand on my nips.
 TMI?
 I quit! I'm a terrible cop.
 Come on, Chief!
This could have happened to anybody
 with a history of cold case files
about ass.
 Plus, I think Hancock got the worst
of all these pranks.
 I heard he shits in a bag now
 and them phones
gave him prostate cancer.
 Yeah. He really got me good, didn't he?
 Goodbye forever.
 [door opens, closes]
 Ah!
 Sorry. I can't get around well
since I lost my ass in 1985.
 That's what I get for skydiving
out a helicopter.
 You're telling me you've been sitting
outside the police station for 30 years?
 It was your ass?
There was no murder?
 You just jumped too high
with your butt sticking out?
 [laughing]
 Case closed!
 [butt] You did it, Chief!
 I'm finally at peace.
Turns out you are a great cop.
 [licking]
 I'm back!
