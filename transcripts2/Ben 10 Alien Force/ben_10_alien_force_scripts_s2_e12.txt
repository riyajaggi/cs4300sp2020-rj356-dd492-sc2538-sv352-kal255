 azmuth come with me there's no point time walker the hybrid armada caught us totally by surprise galvin's planetary defenses are down we don't have a chance and without the galvan no other race in the galaxy has a chance either but, and I hesitate to say this to the smartest being in the universe that's where you're wrong explain we do have a chance the chance you made for us that is not what the omnitrix is for the boy has proven more than once that it can be used for purposes beyond what you intended perhaps come with me to earth i'm not leaving my home not now and I'm not going back without you

 I sincerely hope you'll reconsider in the next three seconds also Ah! I'm all warmed up, It's game time I'm afraid the time for games has passed my friend professor paradox and one other come with me what's so important that i have to miss the auto show the imminent destruction of your primitive world and all who live here but if you'd rather go look at a new convertible by all means professor the hybrid attack has already begun we know we've been fighting them for weeks the situation has escalated they have conquered my homeworld the only planet with the technology to fight them head-on and their next target earth the hybrid attack plan has worked on a dozen worlds they send a small number of hybrid to the target planet then infiltrate the locals by turning them into dna alien slaves

 and use the slaves to build a jump gate correct a hyperspace jump gate is an interstellar shortcut allowing the hybrid to send warships across the galaxy in a matter of seconds the three of us could barely take down one of their ships the ship you defeated wasn't a warship it was a small cruiser that's encouraging no force on this planet could stand against even a single hybrid warship they will send hundreds yeah okay we get it we're hozed unless we stop them before they complete the hyperspace jump gate it should be simple enough to find even if they cloak it it would have to be someplace with an enormous supply of quartz crystal to stabilize the matter transmission frequency you mean like the abandoned quartz mine in los soledad where we saw dn aliens building a giant arch so we know where we gotta go and we know what we gotta do direct approach sure direct but not stupid we've met a bunch of plumbers kids with superpowers and a lot of them owe his favors i say we call them in may i suggest you send your teammates out for that job why i would have a word with the wielder of my omnitrix in private right like i'm gonna miss this see you when you get back gwen hey kevin ethan levin you come with us right now ethan your name is kevin eleven you just lost all remaining pretense of cool you promised you'd never tell yeah whatever so you want to go a couple rounds just give up my reputation precedes me yeah yeah tell us the sheriff nice work kid but if you really want to make a dent in the alien problem you should come with us humans are not the brightest species in the galaxy so i ask you again do you fully understand the risks you are taking of course the hybrid want to take over the earth the hybrid want to destroy the earth if you lose this war it's the end of humanity so i won't lose your foolish disregard of the enormity of the odds against you is precisely why i cannot allow you to take the omnitrix into battle i have told you that the secret of the omnitrix is it allows you to walk a mile in the shoes of other life forms this is not the complete truth here goes nothing works like a charm cooper gwen how'd you get in here i don't care it's great to see you uh oh intangibility glove still experimental but i can use it to create an exception field to three-dimensional physics defying maybe you can tell me about it later i need a favor anything for you gwen you hear that gwen anything give him a break kevin we're asking him to risk his life kevin's juvenile teasing doesn't bother me in the least my adoration for you is far too pure and strong to risk my life we're going back to los soledad to fight the hybrid you don't have to go if you don't want to if you're going and so am i you lied to me i withheld portions of the truth from you until such time as you were ready and i'm ready now no but circumstances forced my hand the omnitrix is the last hope of alien species destroyed by the hybrid how is it supposed to i have stored within it dna samples of every intelligent life form in the milky way galaxy ten thousand of them i know as i'm continually forced to point out you know very little there are over one million samples encoded in the omnitrix a million and with the omnitrix you have the power to return to life any species that the hybrid exterminates including the human race i will not let the hybrid if you are destroyed with the omnitrix there is no hope not for humanity nor for any other race the hybrid extinguished afterwards the omnitrix is noah's ark and you are noah i cannot allow you to participate in the final battle how long is that going to take almost ready sure you want me to do this ben said all the help we could get okay switching on free save yourself the trouble dark star you don't get out of there unless we say so kevin levin and the lovely gwen tennyson to what do i owe this unexpected pleasure we're here to free you from the null void why you put me in here in the first place much as i'd like to take the credit ben gets the glory on that one there's a threat to the earth ben needs your help we all do and if i promise to help you we let you out simple as that then we have an agreement lovely gwen let him out i don't like the way he talks to you we need him cooper why would you trust me i don't but now that you're on earth if you don't help us you won't survive either sorry azimuth but i don't buy your argument the earth needs to be saved and i'm going to do it i won't allow it how could you stop me i'll take the omnitrix from you you'll try very well if you insist on this foolishness perhaps it's best if you have the full power of the omnitrix access master controller master control unlocked everything's unlocked how many aliens can i turn into 1903 genetic samples available the omnitrix's menus are arranged in sets of 10 for simplicity's sake but with voice command you can got it get out of my seat tennyson we brought some help hi ben julie what are you doing here you need help and you can help help oh okay why are we stopping here it's a cloaking field once we go inside it's on okay nothing fancy we go in we destroy the hyperspace jump gate we capture any hybrid we can find that's it one more thing whatever we were before today we're a team we look out for each other we win or lose together haven't seen him for a while what can i say i'm feeling nostalgic they've been busy snow the aliens like it cold i should have brought a jacket i've got a feeling it's going to get pretty hot in here so well that's just so uh wow yes yes yes no stop hurting them this is a battle we do what we must to survive these are human beings michael they're under alien control we take them down not out understand you're a fool ben what would you do cure them actually that's not a bad idea our matrix reverting aliens to humans genetic damage repaired again as many as we can warning energy reserves depleted cycling to recharge mode ben are you okay wake up as much as you need your beauty sleep now's not a good time what happened you misused the power of the omnitrix i was helping people you were wasting power in a pointless exercise good intentions ben but in matters like this timing is everything what do you mean it will come to you are you saying i can't use the omnitrix to cure the dna aliens now that i've seen how you do it maybe you don't have to where are those oh i like that one shot will revert a dna alien to human and it won't hurt them they'll wake up with a little headache jackpot god it's impossible that fairmen must not be allowed to reach us our forces are routed master i do not think we can stop them very well we must accelerate our plans activate the jump gate now as you command guys the jump gate's powering up what do we do now we break it ah not a scratch what's it made of neutronium carbon alloy dude that was totally what's that word rhetorical yeah that everybody get it together on three one two three nothing we're too weak maybe not Waybig!!! it's working ben keep trying back away, It's about to... you OpenSubtitles recommends using Nord VPN from 3.49 USD/month ----> osdb.link/vpn
