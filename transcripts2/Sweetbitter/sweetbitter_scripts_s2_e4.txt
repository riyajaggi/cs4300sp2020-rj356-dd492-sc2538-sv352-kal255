I'm not sure right now. - You're Russian. - I'm everything, honey.

 Who wants it? Jay-Z, apparently. At least, that's what I've read. Have you ever heard of Joseph Campbell? Of course you have. Well, the Atlantic Yards reminds me of that, how he said you can tell what a civilization values most based on its tallest buildings. Yeah, used to be the church. Exactly, and now it's, what, commerce, basketball? You seem to be taking to the city well. Doesn't always feel that way. Helps to have my job, of course, and Simone. You two have known each other a long time. Does anyone actually know Simone? I think maybe I do. Do me a favor. Don't get stuck there. I don't think you will. She never had what you have. Just so you know, I have never, ever called a stranger and asked them out before. I'm glad that you did. Um, are you okay? Uh... yeah. You can relax, you know. Yeah, no. Uh... you too. You can--you can relax. Yeah. Ah. Right, uh... it's just, uh... - Uh... I-I-I wasn't moving or... or really touching you, and... you're making, uh... But you sounded like you were about to... Did you? No, it's, um... I-I didn't, but it's... It's okay. It's fine. Okay. But, uh, you're good? Yeah. Becky? - Oh, hi. - Hi. Wow, a face from my old life. I heard you're at the barbecue place. Oh, yeah, I mean, I'm not exactly putting it on my résumé, but, um, we make strong margaritas. I love margaritas. So how is the old place? Um, you happy? It's--it's good. I'm, um... I am. I was too. Um, I heard about Scott getting fired over a piece of salmon, Jesus. Maddie's such a psycho. - A tornado. - Mm-hmm. Um, Howard hired him back, so... Yeah, like, immediately. I mean, um, Heather keeps me up to date. Yeah. Uh, yeah, well, you should-- you should come by. Yeah, totally. Great. - It was nice to see you. - Yeah, it was great. - Bye. - Bye. Hmm. ROSALYN: Oh, Simone? Howard was looking for you in the basement. SIMONE: Those peonies must have broken the bank, but she forgot the orchids. You recognize? Of course. It's new for him. May I? I believe you were on a crusade to make a grower champagne. It was a long time ago. I'm thinking of taking ten cases. 'Cause there are no other grower champagnes? None this good. Hmm, but I wouldn't want to make you sell it if it made you uncomfortable. That's very considerate of you, Howard. Think on it. You don't have to decide right now. TESS: Guess who I bumped into this morning. Omar's old-man dick? Becky. Didn't know you guys still spoke. I haven't spoken to her since she got fired or transferred or whatever. For you, sir, I have the braised octopus and feta salad. And for you, sir, the lobster shepherd's pie. You are exquisite. Can I get you anything else? What are you mixed with, Italian? HEATHER: You guessed it. Enjoy your meal. You're mixed with Italian? I'm black mixed with black, but since blackness is generally not equated with beauty, people often assume mine comes from elsewhere, usually wherever they're from, so some nights, I'm Greek, Puerto Rican, Italian. How does that not make you mad? If I got mad about every ignorant thing a guest said to me, I couldn't work here. HOWARD: Ladies. - HEATHER: Howard. Sasha...have you seen him? Uh, no. No. Because today's officially the first time he's no-showed for a shift ever. I called. Any ideas where he might be? No, Howard. Hmm. Carry on. JAKE: Your Russian friend fucked things up tonight. I'm getting my own bar mops. Yeah, I know. He's never not shown up for work before. It's weird. I texted him. He's seemed off lately. I didn't know that you noticed other people. How was your date? Can you make me two espressos for 32? Sure. So how was dinner with Omar? Um, uh, it was great. He's great. He's really great. He's uncomfortably smart, and his apartment... On the first date. Yeah. I mean, I wanted to. I really wanted to, and, I don't know, it--it got kind of awkward. Was it just, like, first-date awkward? Maybe. So Howard got rid of the orchids, his wife's orchids. I mean, they were hideously outdated, but I thought it was charming. Guess he's announcing that he's moving on. Oh. I think he's still dating Becky. I don't know. I-I bumped into her today, and she knew all this stuff about the restaurant. Is that right? Hmm. Hmm. There's an open bottle of champagne in the fridge with a very familiar label. Are you in touch with Etienne? No. It's Howard twisting a very dull knife, trying to put me in my place. Sad, really. Um, that's fine. Ten cases should be a good test. We can see if it sells. Terrific. It was my choice. I left that marriage, so I want nothing but success for him. Poor Tess. Poor Tess? Mm, didn't I tell you? She's experimenting with Omar. - Omar Gamal? - Mm-hmm. I mean, he's--he's a little old for her. He's old enough to be her father. I suppose it's not anyone's business. I suppose. I mean, I'm glad she's dating an adult, but it's him I can't understand, avoiding his mortality and his receding hairline by pursuing a literal child. I'm sure they all think they're good men, but... there's something so predatory about it, don't you think? ARI: This will cheer you up. Here. Thanks. What happened? I was just-- L-last night with Omar, I f-- I felt like the sex was off, like I wasn't doing it right or something. Okay, there is no right. There's only one question: was it fun? Ugh. Oh, Wilbur, ha, you had sex with Tess. Mm. Mm-mm. - Was she fun? - Ari. I'm not answering that question. Wow, you guys are so...boring. Where the fuck is Sasha when I need him? Uh... You know that I'm not one of your girlfriends, right? I do know that, yes. And you don't have to date old guys or rich guys. It's not like a-- a rite of passage. I also know that. And it was fun with you. Okay, you don't have to say that. I just did. Pick up, table 24! MAN: Got it. Wait, did you say 24? Yeah. Do you ever spit in food? Not my food. I should spit in their food. Should you? No. No, I wa-- Sorry, Howard, I was--I was joking. So I can trust the food will arrive safely without additional seasoning? Of course. They just said something offensive to Heather, not to me, so I-- Offensive how? It-- They're just being assholes. It's fine. Uh, forget I said anything. HEATHER: What the fuck? What did you say to Howard? He asked if I want him to throw out table 24. Um... I just mentioned that they were being assholes. I didn't ask you to do that. It's a $600 check. Sorry. I just-- I thought it was fucked up. That's fucked up? They like me here because I'm pretty and smart and I know how to talk to people and because I make this place seem progressive by giving it an ounce of color, so yes, I hear some fucked-up shit, but I make good money and it's a lot better than other places I've been. If, for some reason, I need your help, I will ask for it. Understood. Sorry. EDDIE: Wow, look at you. I mean, that was-- that was some speech. Like, I-I almost believed it. Do I know you? Bro, I like her. What'll it be? Uh, the crémant, please. Make me a little roadie. You heading out? Yeah, I'm gonna go to Sasha's. Someone has to check on him. Sasha lives in Kew Gardens. Do you even know where that is? Yeah, Queens. Deep Queens. I'll come with you. You get murdered walking around there, we'll be down two fucking back waiters. You know, you are allowed to say that you're worried about him too. TESS: Sasha? - Hey, Sasha. JAKE: Yo, Sasha. We got a big bag of blow. TESS: Sasha, I know you're in there. - JAKE: Come on, baby boy. - TESS: Now. I'm coming. Ah, we're here for the housewarming party. What the fuck? Guess we missed it. TESS: Jesus, Sasha. - TESS: So... - Shoes, guys. You were supposed to work tonight. What happened with that? TESS: Okay, here's what's gonna happen. - Jake's gonna straighten up. - Don't touch. TESS: I'm gonna make some food. You-- You want scrambled eggs or fried? I'm serious. Sasha, you need to eat something. He doesn't want fucking eggs. - There you go. TESS: Jake, what are you doing? So what did it? I mean, you're usually pretty perverted and gross and fucked up, so I'm not that impressed. Hey, Jake, what? Some shit must have happened to get you here to this delightful place. So what was it? Tell me a story. Oh, you want some attention? Whoo! Sasha, we're here. But I don't think that's what you want. Hey, no. Something triggered this. Could be small. For me sometimes, it's just getting the hiccups. I can't breathe. Then there are times, worse. Someone shows up. The wrong song comes on. I can make it till morning. Now, I know this. No one, and I mean no one, is here to rescue you, least of all me. I'm just here to give my karmic duty, giving you some advice that was given to me, and maybe you can pass it on to Tess when you're picking her up off the floor in the future. You can talk about it, or you can let it kill you. I don't give a fuck either way, but that is how it goes. Grisha. They beat him up so bad in R--in Russia. He is in a coma now. I'm so sorry, Sasha. It is what it is. Ugly, like fuckin' life. Forever in limbo in your country, you know? This is different. If I go home... Hey. Come on. I can't go home. Hey. I might as well fucking die right here. Hey. I think we can find you a better place to die. Here. God, Thursdays are so awful in there. It's, like, all frat bros. Becky. Um, excuse me. Hey, did we have plans? No, no, I-I just thought I might catch you. Um, I wanted to ask you something. I know you know how important it is that we keep our relationship secret. Yeah, you've made that clear. Did you tell Simone? Uh, yeah, yeah, I did, at our standing pedicure date. Howard, I don't talk to Simone. I haven't seen her since you fired me. I transferred you. Are you sure you didn't tell Simone? Don't talk to me like I'm stupid. I didn't tell her. I saw Tess, but I didn't say anything, I don't think. You don't think? Well, what exactly did you say to her? - I'm not into this. - Listen, I was explicit. My reputation is very important. Okay, fuck your reputation. You know what you are, Howard? You are a fucking asshole. You can't even hide it. You are an old middle-manager fucking asshole. - You all right? - Yeah. I am done here. Get the fuck out of here. TESS: Hi. Sorry I'm late. Had a long night. Where are we going? Here. Sit. The wine lesson's here? The wine lesson is here. This is a grower champagne grown in a small estate on the north side of Reims... Where I walked every morning. It's a tiny production, not blended out of 50 other wines. It is honest. It is... - Itself. You grew it? My idea. Now here it is with my ex-husband's name on the bottle. Yes, I was married. No, I don't want to talk about it. Just want to drink... With you. Hmm. Mmm. So Omar's kind of an asshole. Wasn't first-night jitters? No. No, it was just bad. The sex was awkward and...humiliating. Did he do something to you? No, no, no. He--he just... wanted to please me so badly, but I don't--I... I don't really do that with people. Ah. I mean, I do. I ha-- I-I can. I-I just don't always totally come with them, and then I pretended to and-- Ah, yes, disaster. Right. It was weird. It was like I-I-I couldn't feel anything. I was outside of my body watching. Did you ask for what you wanted? I...don't think I knew what I wanted. Do you know what you like? Okay, well, a couple months ago, you didn't know what you liked in wine, and now...sec or demi-sec? Sec. Once you know what you like, you can ask for it. Then it becomes pleasure. Also, Omar is a narcissistic workaholic, so good riddance. Can I ask you something personal? - About my marriage? - About Jake. Well, his mom, actually. Did she drown on accident? It-- He came with me to Sasha's. Jake went to Sasha's? Yeah. And he...seemed different. I don't know...open. For a long time, he thought that she drowned, and I kept it hidden from him for as long as I could, but no, it wasn't an accident. Jake is fine. Jake is lucky. He has never, ever been alone. I have always been there to take care of him. I don't mean to offend you, but this champagne is crazy good. - I know. I know. - Hmm. - Here, let's drink more of it. - Oh. MAN: ♪ When all the numbers swim together ♪ ♪ And all the shadows settle ♪ ♪ When doors forced open shut again ♪ ♪ A flytrap and a petal ♪ ♪ My eyes burn and claws rush in to fill them ♪ ♪ And in the morning after the night ♪ ♪ I fall in love with the light ♪ ♪ It is so clear, I realize ♪ ♪ That here at last, I have my eyes ♪ ♪ When all the figures sound retreat ♪ ♪ The soft skin starts to shrivel ♪ ♪ When dreams made real become less sweet ♪ ♪ The orchid and the metal ♪ ♪ My sex turns and claws rush in to spill them ♪ ♪ And in the morning after the night ♪ ♪ I fall in love with the light ♪
