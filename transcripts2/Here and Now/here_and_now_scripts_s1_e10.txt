 There. You see that, right? What the fuck is that? I didn't program that. We think your talent would be a great fit. What exactly are we talking about? We'd like to acquire your business. What the fuck are you to tell me about religion? It's true. I am a white man who found his faith in books. You want my religion, take it. It's all yours, Chuck. Audrey... We're talking about workers throwing themselves

 off the roof of a building! All right, fine, fine. Do you really want to throw this away for something I can fix? Is everything okay? I've been thinking about the kids. Everything's fine. Everything is not fine. When I was a kid, shadows would follow me. Don't come at it from fear. What kind of an influence are you? I'm trying to protect you! I saw this behaviour in one of your patients. What will she say? Well, you're always nagging me about embracing the spiritual...

 I'm not doing this again! I'm going to focus on what's real. Are you okay? Are you upset with me? You paid a Japanese prostitute. I was lost. I'm fine. Do you smell the smoke? Yes. No, no, no! Hailey? Hailey! Daddy! Okay. Oh. Oh, my God. Okay. Oh my God. Are you okay, baby? Does it hurt? What happened? What happened? - It hurts. - Okay. Honey, is it a muscular pain or a bone pain? Mom! It might be a hairline fracture. What the fuck, Ramon? There was a fire... - No! - Hey! Hey, Malcolm! - Malcolm! - You're fucking crazy! - Back off, Malcolm! - The ladder was on fire. I was just trying to fucking save her. This whole fucking family is nuts. We gotta get her to the emergency room in case her arm is really broken. You stay away from her! I'll drive. No, I can. Hailey needs to be with me. She needs to be with women, nurturing, healing women. Ashley? I agree with her. Meet us at St. Mary's. Daddy? You're gonna be okay, baby, all right? Mommy's gonna take care of you. Is Hailey all right? Okay. Okay. Come on, Dad. We should follow them. We can take my car. Fuck, man. I could've killed him. But you didn't kill him. Yeah, Dad. Not even close. Yeah, but I could have. I could have. _ _ It's very possible I will never know. Farid, you're not making any sense. Navid is right here. Farid? Leave me be. You were right. Hairline fracture. That's not that bad. Duc had the same thing when he was little. He wore a cast for a few weeks, bounced right back. They're fitting her with one right now. Thank God. Ramon is gonna be so relieved. Fuck Ramon. It's not his fault. I have a five-year-old in there with a broken arm because Ramon saw something. Yeah, but he was trying to save her. Oh my...! Nothing is ever Baby Jesus's fault. You know, you... You need to deal with him before something really bad happens. What are you suggesting? That we have him institutionalized? He's obviously sick, and now he's violent. If anyone's violent, it's Malcolm. You have always resented Ramon. You and Duc both. I-I... I can't. I can't. I can't do this with you right now. - I am not the enemy. - You go home. Go home, or we're both gonna say something that we regret. Kristen. Ashley, you can be such a bitch. - Fuck off! - And, sweetie, I know how scary it is when your child has been hurt... Mom. Stop talking. So I'm not taking this too personally. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Farid? Mama! Mama! _ It's coming. What's coming? I don't know yet. Is he on medication? I stopped. I'm not crazy, Duc. I have a porous mind, which nobody believes, I know. I'm not ruling it out, son. I never have. You dropped Hailey out of a tree house. - I saved Hailey. - Ramon... there was no fire, no one else saw a fire. There was a fire. Duc, neither of us was there. We don't know exactly what he saw. I know, Dad, and yet shockingly, you're taking Baby Jesus's side. Ramon? Ramon? Hey, Ram. Hey! Hey! - Ramon! - Damn it! Ramon, come back! Ram! Uh, hello? Okay. Sorry. Was that the neighbor you were telling me about? Remember what the doctor said, Hailey. We have to keep our arm in the sling. My fingers don't work. I know, but I'll tell you what. You pick out the stickers you want... and Daddy... will put 'em on your cast for you. - Does that sound good? - Mm-hmm. - Ooh, good choices. - Hey. I want you to tell Mommy something. What did Tio Ramon say when he had you hanging outside the tree house? - Ash. - Did he say that there was a fire? - There was a fire. - There was a fire? - Did you see it? - I smelled smoke. - You did? - There was a lot of smoke. She's five. Tio Ramon saved me. We lost him. He just jumped out of the car and ran away. - What? - Is Ramon okay? Greg, find him. Find him! Kristen: Mom! How long were you fucking her? Huh? The Asian prostitute you cheated on Mom with. I went back... to my village in Vietnam... by myself after that trip to Thailand. I wanted to know I was past it. I got there and something else was there, a cannery or something. I don't really remember the outside, but I remember the smell, the fishermen, the raw shrimp and gasoline, just like her sheets used to smell. She got me this dog bed... to lay on, on the floor when they were there. My own bed. And late at night, she'd pick me up in it and put me next to her pillow off the floor, away from the rats. Duc, I... I never thought for a minute that... Yeah, and that's the problem, isn't it? Your son was born to a 14-year-old in a whorehouse, and it never crossed your mind that fucking an Asian hooker represented some... I don't know... conflict of interest or moral crime, you fucking hypocrite? You turn your nose up at my life, my job trying to help actual fucking people, because it fails to live up to your philosophical standards? And then you go cash in your university checks for some exotic young pussy. Wow. This is deeper than even I... - So is she the fetish or are we? - Fetish? Your rainbow kids. Your noble, oh-so-enlightened experiment. You're a fucking fraud. Duc, I wonder if you could come off that cross for just a minute or two. Jesus Christ. You were 28 pounds when we got you. You almost died. I held you in my arms, I rocked you. I fed you from a bottle... a five-year-old! I got as close to you as you would let me, which wasn't very much, but I stayed. Now, granted, an Asian prostitute is... a serious lapse in judgment. But do you really believe that I consciously chose her to hurt you? What kind of person do you think I am? I'm just your fucking dad, Duc. I'm not perfect. That's who you pretend to be, always so fucking disciplined that you're... celibate? Really? You know, you're not the only one talking to Chris Wolfe at Fairfax. They're reissuing my book, remember? You have quite a reputation up in Vancouver. Celibate. So... I guess we're both frauds. Hmm? Get over it. Fuck you. Fuck you back, you little shit. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Ramon, it's Mom again. Please let me know you're okay. Just call... or text or email, whatever's easiest. I'm scared. - Did you find him? - No. You told Duc about my affair? Okay. First... it wasn't an affair. It was a transaction. And second, of course not. I don't want any of the kids to ever know about that. Too late. Duc already does. Pretty much just divorced me as a father, so I've lost both of our sons today. Father of the fucking year. Fuck! I can't stop thinking... this is what Ramon's birth mother felt for over 20 years... not knowing where he is... if he's alive or dead. We did that. No. No, we didn't. Someone else would've adopted him, and we thought it was legit, because Beverly Mills conned us, because she's a fucking criminal. Just one of many, apparently. What the fuck have we done? _ All right. Ramon texted me. He's home. He's okay. Oh my God. But he doesn't really wanna talk to anyone or see anyone, okay? Dad, can I borrow your car? I wanna go see Navid. I don't think that's a really good idea right now, honey. Okay, well, I don't wanna just sit here and think about Ramon. The anxiety is making me sick. I really need to be with my boyfriend. Mom. Boyfriend? Navid is really your boyfriend? What's that supposed to mean? Just because he doesn't wear his testosterone on his sleeve means that he's gay? Of course not! And for your information, we already had sex, so. - What? - Did you use a condom? Mom. Eww. Kristen! He was a virgin! I gotta go. I need a drink. So do I. Duc. What can I do? Oh, ho, ho, yes. Come here, baby. All right. There we go. Four years is a long time, Malcolm. Well... I could go full-time. Have they offered you? No, I, uh... I meant full-time primary caregiver. You mean quit your job. No, I mean commit to a different job... full-time. Free you up. Okay, that is a lot. Oh, ho, ho! Yup, it is Mommy's turn. Um, how would we make up for... your lost income? Four to five mill. It's just an option. That's a great option for you. Yeah, yeah, 'cause taking care of her all day is really easy. No work at all. Look... Ash... if you want me to get a different job... - Mm-hmm. - One that pays better, I'll start looking. I just... I think it's important for Hailey to have parents who are happy doing what they do, so if this opportunity isn't gonna make you happy, do not do it. We'll be fine. Oh my gosh. Oh, no! Yes! That is the best yet. Yes. I just... I'm just thinking about the future, the possibility of long-lasting generational wealth for Hailey's safety, for ours. I mean, you can think about it all you want, but the future's gonna be what the future's gonna be. See? And that's what scares me. We just left her there. She was not well. She was... she was overwhelmed with-with... fear and grief and-and... and I know she was bipolar, but then they had no drugs then, and certainly not there. It wasn't your fault. - You were just a child. - No, no, no, no. No, on some level, I knew. I knew that I was abandoning her. I made the choice to abandon her. Let's call Dr. Langsdale tonight... before it gets worse, before... - before you hurt anyone. - What? I won't hurt anyone. Wh... I have never hurt anyone. Why don't you just have me committed, if that's what you think? What's going on? - Is he... - No. - Should I stay? - No. Go. Have fun. Okay? Just keep your phone charged. Are you seeing that girl? Kristen. But why, Navid-jan. Why? She got you in trouble. You're all banged up. Really? We're afraid of you, Farid. We're afraid of what's happening to you. What's happening to me is happening for a reason. What if that reason is... simply punishment? Mm. Here. Right? Whoa. That's a lot of pain. Old pain. You poor boy. Duc. I am so sorry you had to suffer like this... for so long. You can let this go. You can be done with it. Wait, wait, hold on. You're on my hair. Okay. What is it? It's... it's not working. So, what's going on? - Are you not into me? - Of course I'm into you. - I just... - You just what? We did it, like, once, and now it's expected. You brought a condom. I'm sorry. It's just... - too fast or being in this car... - Or what? Just say it. I just don't... think this is who I am. What? A guy who... has sex? A guy who has sex with girls? - No, that's not even... - Or a guy who has sex with me? It's just... it feels like everything's changed all of a sudden, and... Oh, what? What? You feel smothered? You need your space? Wow. What a fucking cliché. Kristen. Come on, don't do this. You need to get your shit together, dude. Kristen. I've always felt like I should've saved her... from those men. Of course. You were five years old. Children make themselves responsible. It's easier than accepting chaos. It's all just chaos, isn't it? Well, not just. What's the worst thing that's ever happened to you? What a lovely question. My father died in a car accident. I was in the car. I was 11 years old. Oh my God. It wasn't an ongoing trauma like yours, but it was one big surprise trauma. - I'm so sorry. - Mmm. It happens. I just realized I haven't had explosive diarrhea in a while. The bathroom's right through there. Thank you. Thank you. I'm turning in. Night. _ Ike? Where the fuck are you? Okay. - Hello? - Really? You couldn't call me back all day yesterday? Mom. I'm good. I believe you, but I want to see you. I'll take you to a restaurant of your choice. - Tonight. - Toro Bravo. You're on. Oh, I love that place. Mom, I gotta call you back. What the fuck are you? _ _ Attention, stage. We're going live in 30 minutes. Ooh! Wow. Mmm. Look, I've already got several of our lawyers looking into this labor issue. It'll be resolved by the end of the day. Relax. You should have fun with this. That's not why I'm tense. My youngest son, Ramo... You know what? I don't really wanna talk about it. Okay. Okay. Well, all you need to do is just one thing, and then... you can take all the time you need to deal with Ramon. Deal with him? Audrey, I can see you're upset. I... - Do we need to cancel? - No. No. Of course not. Excellent. All you need to do is keep your eye on all the good that we're gonna accomplish with The Empathy Initiative. And I promise you that we'll take care of this other thing. You remember Cait. She's gonna take you back for hair and makeup and you can meet Jack and Cathy. Cait. Ms. Bayer. Please, just, uh, follow me. - Ashley! - Hi. - Hi. Sit, please. - Thank you. Do you want anything to eat or drink? Uh, no, no, I'm good. You are good. So, where's Cliff? Oh, Cliff is no longer with us. - We are so happy to have you here. - Thank you. I'm so happy to have you here. I get to check off two boxes with you. I'm sorry? Oh, I get to say that because I'm a double-boxer myself. S... So I'm a diversity hire? Oh God, no. No. I'm just saying it doesn't hurt, right? It looks good, it is good? Ashley, don't make this into a thing, please. It was just a tasteless and very... un-PC joke. - Uh... - Apologies. You're here because of your work and nothing else, okay? Speaking of which... I love that dress. - It's fabulous. - Thank you. Yeah. Very Cloth. It sounds so simple. That's exactly what I said, Jack. It is simple. I mean, do we want to invest in teaching kids empathy skills? We believe doing so would profoundly affect society in so many positive ways. I love it. Ah. Well, if Cathy loves it... Okay. We have a call from Lake Oswego. You're live on the air. What's your name? Hi, I'm Bridget from the Coalition for Humane Labor Practices. Oh, we thought you were from Lake Oswego. I want to make it clear... - What's on your mind, Bridget? - Yeah, I was wondering how The Empathy Initiative works alongside child labor? Benjamin Ventures is in the process... Which The Washington Post now alleges, in addition to the worker suicides has led to a humanitarian crisis. Thank you, Bridget. Do we have another caller on the line? Look, the child labor allegations were news to us. The minute we found out, we divested from the emerging markets fund that was in question. What I'd like to talk about is The Empathy Initiative. Divested, huh? Just walked away? Washed your hands of the whole thing? Well, of course. I couldn't possibly continue to profit... So, that's what's important, you not profiting? Of course not, but... Do you even care if it keeps happening or is it just about the optics to you? Are you suggesting that I... Do something? Yeah. You're a billionaire. - Should we go to commercial? - Yeah. Don't cut me off. I'm not done yet. You know, the thing about The Empathy Initiative is... is it's just a shiny distraction, Jack, to keep from looking too closely at what really goes on all over the globe. It's business. We'll be right back. Oh my God. This is why liberals always lose. Anything less than Utopian is unacceptable. Yeah, I want everything to be better for everybody, and I do everything I can to make that a reality. For me, that's recycling and driving a hybrid. For you... oh, I don't know... - not using child labor. - I didn't know! I just found out, and I'm trying to fix it! Spending some of your millions creating a workplace where people don't wanna kill themselves? Do you really think you're not complicit here? Do you know where every article of clothing you own comes from? Everything you eat? Everything you get from the drugstore? - You used me. - That is not true. You fucked me. It was more than that, - and you know it. - Do I? How can I ever trust you, Steven? Oh, I know... I can't. Goodbye. - I'm not the bad guy here. - Fuck you! Give me your fucking bike, hippie! - No fucking way, dude! - Gimme that! Thanks, man. Ramon, he was in there for two hours. Hey. You know Henry Bergen, right? I'm Henry Bergen. How the fuck do you know my name? Oh my God. Dad. I'm sorry. It's bigger than me. Where did you get the cat-o'-nine-tails or... whatever the hell you call that awful thing? I've had it since the last time. I buried it under the floor. So, you've been planning. I've been ready. Okay. We're leaving. Dad. You need help. There are people that want to help. Please, just let them. Take care of him. Please. Come on. Sweet. Yes? Ike? It's Lucy. You have a visitor. - He says you're expecting him? - Yes, thank you. - Hey, man. - Extension 38 if you need anything. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's wrong? Are you kidding? What isn't wrong? Sit down. Sit, sit, sit. Hey. I... I got you. - I'm here. - I know. I know. Thank you. I need to tell somebody... and I can't tell Audrey, because I know that she's been very unhappy. I always know that. But, uh, I never call her. She's got so much to take care of, so many people. Well, she wouldn't mind, if you called, Ike, I'm sure. No, that's... this isn't what I wanted to talk about. Okay. You changed your book. Um, I don't think I did. I read it again, and it's totally different. Huh. You're my friend, Greg, I trust you. - You know that, right? - You're my friend, too, Ike. Audrey keeps things from me. She doesn't want me to get upset. She hasn't told me anything about Ramon. What about... What about him? You know why I trust you? Do you remember when I first met Ramon? He was a little baby, and he was sleeping, you let me hold him, - and I dropped him? - Yeah, I remember. It was because he was on fire. Well, he's on fire again. Wh-what exactly... do you mean? Okay. Um, I'm on a different medication... Plus I got old... so when I see things... When I see things, I know they're not there, even though they are. You know what I mean? Maybe... I wouldn't drop him today, maybe. But when I did, you didn't try to make me feel crazy like Audrey did. How is Ramon on fire again? Do things feel normal to you? Oh, what... what is normal? Don't you feel like something's wrong? I do. I... I do. See, I've always felt... well, I mean, since I've gotten sick I've always felt that way, but it's gotten worse. It's outside of me. Yeah. It's everywhere. Hey. You hungry? Um... I can make you something extremely bland. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. Um, no, I don't wanna make you work. Okay. We could go out somewhere. It's a beautiful day. Yeah, let's go out. Or... not. Okay. And this is Steven Anderson. - Pleasure. - And we have James Emery. - Yes. - Robert Coldwell. Welcome to Cloth, Ashley. Thank you very much. And this is Geetha Nayar. Ashley. Pleasure to meet you, Geetha. May you joining us, Ashley, lead to good things for all of us. Huh? Mmm. Sharon, I just need to call my attorney, run a few things by him before I sign. Oh, yeah, absolutely. - Great. - Sure. We look forward to your counter. Um, Ashley. You're not thinking of bagging on this, are you? 'Cause that would make me look really bad. - Okay. - I was just joking about the double-boxer stuff before. - I swear. - I just need to make one call. Okay. Just focus on what you want. Okay? Life is too short not to. Okay. I'm not gonna take it. - I'm not gonna take it. - Wow. What "wow"? "Wow" like, that's a gutsy move and you're proud of me, or "wow" as in you're disappointed? No, not disappointed. Surprised. I guess you really convinced me that all that money would make us safer. You know, I mean, who knows what's gonna happen in this fucking country? So, you think I should take it? I didn't say that. I... What... what I'm saying is... look... What are you doing here? I'm here to say goodbye. My mom's waiting out front. She's leaving my dad. Oh my God. Why? It's, um... He's... It doesn't matter. I have to go with her. - Where? - She has a sister in San Francisco. Oh God. You're going to San Francisco? That's insane. You could just stay here. - Kristen. - Wait. No, I know my parents are not gonna care. Then you won't have to, like, miss school. School is over in two weeks anyways. Well, how long are you gone for? I don't know. No. No, I don't want you to go. I mean... I know that things are weird with us, but you're my only friend. I know. I'll miss you too, but... I have to go with my mom. So... bye. We'll stay in touch. Promise. Do you hate me? Of course not. I was... I was kind of a bitch to you. Yeah. You were. Bye. I'm so ashamed. I... I just couldn't stop. I'm too weak. Maybe this was something you needed to do for reasons you don't understand yet. I envy you. I... I see your faith. I see it's goodness. I really do. I feel its comfort. Why did I meet Ramon? Why did he dream of my mother mutilating herself? His seeing my past... What does it all mean? I'm... Wh-wh... what am I supposed to do? You know, in Islam, the need to have all the answers is considered a kind of heresy. I'm a big sinner then. I've spent my life, I make my living searching for answers. Should I stop? "Islam" literally means "surrender." Are you familiar with the observer effect in quantum physics? It refers to changes that the act of observation makes on whatever phenomenon is being observed. I think this might be a little above my pay grade. Well... some people see that as proof of God... That there has to be something watching... for anything to exist. And that something is... God? Do you know what I take as proof of God? This moment right here. I have a chance to be of service to a fellow man in need... talk to him about things that matter. Doesn't get much better than that. What the fuck can we do, Ike? Whatever's gonna happen is gonna happen... whether we'd like it to or not... no matter how much optimism we have... or how much we believe in... rational thought or God or... aliens. There's no such thing as aliens. - You don't think? - No. No, 'cause if there were, they would have tried to contact me by now. Everything does. You know, Ike, I think... Ramon might be sick... like you. The same illness. No, I don't think so. Why not? Because I... I was never on fire. You feel that? Feel what? It's here. I'm scared. Now, don't be scared. The whole world is collapsing. What the fuck? 'Cause this is very confusing. Do you hear that? Sounds like an air... Malcolm? No. Mal... Hello? Hello? If you are just joining us, this is News 8's continuing coverage of the eruption of Mount Hood, which began at 11:11 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time, this morning and lasted nearly 30 minutes. At least 30 people are dead, dozens more are missing, and hundreds have sought treatment in area hospitals for injuries ranging from broken bones and severe burns to respiratory problems. Thousands are without electrical power and cell phone service has been severely affected. Government health officials are calling the air quality unhealthy and are strongly recommending the use of air filters, gas masks, or other breathing apparatus, even indoors. Emergency workers are out in force in the affected area, distributing bottled water and respiration masks to the local citizens. But according to the governor, the safest thing to do is just hunker down, stay indoors, and wait for these conditions to improve. If you need a place to go, the state has set up temporary shelters in the following locations: Three Lakes, Estacada... Synced & corrected by * Rambo Media Ltd *
