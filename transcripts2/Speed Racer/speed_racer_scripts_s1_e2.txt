 He's jamming down the pedal like he's never coming back Adventure's waiting just ahead Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer, go! [SPEED] These are the controls of the most powerful and amazing racing car in the world, the Mach 5. Control A releases powerful jacks to boost the car, so that Sparky, our mechanic, can quickly make any necessary repairs or adjustments. Control B: Press this button and the Mach 5 sprouts special grip tires for traction over any kind of terrain. At the same time, 5,000 horsepower is distributed equally to each wheel by auxiliary engines. Control C: For use when I have to

 race over heavily wooded terrain. Powerful rotary saws are protruded from the front of the Mach 5 to slash and cut any and all obstacles. This is Control Button. Which, when pressed, releases a powerful deflector, which seals the cockpit into an air-conditioned, bullet and crash-proof, and water-tight chamber. Inside it, I am completely isolated and shielded. E: The control for special illumination. Which can be traversed singly or in tandem. And which enables me to see much further and more clearly than with ordinary headlights. It's invaluable in some of the weird and dangerous places that I race the Mach 5. [SPEED] This is Control F, which I use when the Mach 5 is underwater. First, the cockpit is supplied with oxygen. Then, a periscope is raised to scan the surface of the water. Everything that is seen is relayed down to me by television. [SPEED] Control G releases a homing robot from the front of the car. The homing robot can carry pictures or tape recorded messages to whomever and wherever ll wanna send them. The Mach 5 is the most complex and ingenious car ever built-- A tribute to my father's imagination, genius, and technical skill. The Mach 5 always was a great car, but a couple of years ago, Pops drew up the designs for making it the car it now is. Because certain men were after those plans, he hid them by drawing them in invisible ink on the windshield Sparky and I installed on the Mach 5. Pops needed money to rebuild the car. So, against his wishes, I entered the Sword Mountain Race to try to win the $5,000 prize money. However, Aceucey and his men came after me to try to get the windshield with the plans. [SPEED] They got rid of some of the other racers, and then came after me. [SPEED] Oh! [THUG A] What a daredevil! [THUG B] He made it though! THUG Cl Not for long. [SPEED] No sign of them. Good. I guess they've given up. Trixie, calling the Mach 5, calling the Mach 5. The designs are written on your windshield in invisible ink. I know, Trixie.on't worry, I'll be careful. But I'm going to finish this race and win the money that Pops needs. [TRIXIE] But, Speed, those men aren't going to give up so easily. They'll stop at nothing to get those designs, and if they don't get them, they'll make sure no one else does by getting rid of you and the Mach 5. Stop being such a worrier, Trixie. I'll be all right. So long. See ya later. [TRIXIE] He's in danger. Doesn't he know it? [BOTH] Whee! With Speed at the wheel, how can we lose the race? He'll win. [BOTH yelp] Ahh! [CHIM CHIM gibbers] I've got to pass that car! [DUGGERY] Uh-oh! The Mach 5! But Speed's not going to win this race, not if I can help it. [SPEED] I'll try to pass. [SPRITLE groans] I'll be glad when Speed gets on this big road again. This race is murder! [SPEED] Hm?! Here comes Aceucey and his gang. [tires screech] Isn't there any way to avoid them? [DUGGERY] Well, there's a road that cuts to the left. He'll never make it. [THUG A] Lucky for us, he took that way. In a few minutes, he'll be a sitting duck. Let's go! [THUG A] I don't mind somebody's dust, but this is ridiculous! [engines revving] [SPRITLE] This doesn't look good! Speed better do something while he can. [gasps] [gasps] Stop firing, you stonehead.o you wanna smash that windshield? [THUGS gasp] [screams] --[THUG C] Bombs! --[tires screech] [tires screeching] [THUG] Get down! [THUG E] Huh? It was just a trick! They were only smoke flares. I'm taking this shortcut. It'll keep me away from Speed and those other guys. He's headed for the volcanoes! He'll smash up down in that area. [THUGS screaming] [tires screech] Most of them are lost in the smoke. Quick, gimme the gun. [ACE] I'll take care of this. [cackles] [ACE snickers] That does it. That's for droppin' those smoke bombs on us. We're even. --[THUG F] Hey, Ace! --[ACE] Huh? [THUG F] Look! I've always wanted to find out what parachute jumping is like. [gasps] Duggery! Get out of here! Mind your own business! [DUGGERY] Hey! [gasps] [SPEED] Duggery! [SPEED] Duggery, where are you? Duggery! Duggery! Dug-- Ahh! [screams] [DUGGERY] Looks as if... neither one of us is... ...going to win those 5,000 bucks. We'll be lucky if we get out of this volcano with our skins! [DUGGERY groans] [SPEED] If he hadn't been so muleheaded, and if I hadn't tried to save him, ll wouldn't be down here. I might be able to get out, but-- No. No, I can't leave him trapped there. I've got to help him. [DUGGERY grunting] [DUGGERY] The rock's giving way! [gasps] [SPEED] Hang on, I'm coming! Here,uggery. I'll try to pull you out of there. Hang onto my hand! [gasps] [DUGGERY screams] [BOTH grunting] Climb! [DUGGERY grunting] [SPEED] Come on! [DUGGERY grunting] [DUGGERY screams] [BOTH grunting] [SPEED] Come on, maybe-- Maybe we can make it. [BOTH grunting] [BOTH scream] [BOTH grunting] BOTH gasp) [DUGGERY] I'm gonna jump! Try to follow me! [BOTH grunting, panting] [BOTH sigh] The only way we'll be able to get out of this area is if we both use the Mach 5. [ACE] This is the car. And written in invisible ink on the windshield are the plans we want. Try to stop us and it'll be too bad for her. We're takin' the Mach 5. How did you get here?! It's easy. When they shot the plane, I jumped out and came down by parachute. [ACE] Aah... We've got this glass now, so we can get rid of them. We don't want anybody finding out how we got these plans. [THUG B] Hey, you! Hold it! [DUGGERY] Huh? I have nothing to do with this whole thing. I just wanna get back in the race. So long! [ACE] Stop him! [DUGGERY groans] [DUGGERY] They missed! But they're going to pay for that. Okay, men, get rid of 'em. [gasps] [THUG G groans] [THUGS groan] Who's throwing rocks? Come outta there! [groans] Now's our chance! [THUGS gasping] [THUGS groaning] [SPRITLE, CHIM CHIM giggle] [BOTH growl] [BOTH growl] [BOTH growl] [CHIM CHIM gibbers] [gasps] Our plan almost worked. We got nearly all of 'em. But now, we better think of something else. [THUG H screams] [THUG H groans] [THUG H] Come back here, you brat! Wait till I get my mitts on you! [SPRITLE, CHIM CHIM giggle] [THUG H groans] [THUG H] Come back here! [SPRITLE] Hurry, Chim Chim! [THUG H] Come back here! Huh, where'd they go? [THUG H groans] One more for us! [SPEEgrunts] [gasps] [screams] [SPRITLE] Hurray foruggery! Hurray foruggery! [THUG H] You kids are gonna get it as soon as I get you! Huh, where'd they go? [SPRITLE] Now! [THUG H cries] [THUG H yelps] Makes two for our side! --[SPEEgrunting] --[THUGS groaning] --[alarm sounds] --Huh? --[alarm sounds] --[gasps] --[alarm sounding] --[THUGS gasp] The fuzz! Let's get outta here! [TRIXIE gasps, grunts] [TRIXIE] Oh, Speed! Are you all right? [SPEED] Uh-huh. Look! The Mach 5! Huh?! I'm taking that car! [THUG 1] Oh yeah?! [THUG I groans] Ha, ha! Now I've got the fastest car in the universe! You'll never catch me now! What kind of cheap car is this?! It doesn't move fast enough to catch the Mach 5! This car's got everything, including plans on the windshield for an even better engine! [ACE cackles] [screams] How do I work this car? [SPEED] I've caught up with him. But how do I get him to stop? [grunts] [screams] [BOTH grunting] [BOTH grunting] [groans, screams] [tires screech] [sighs] [gasps] You're a tough kid, but you're no match for Aceucey. [ACE cackles] [ACE] Go ahead, Speed! Keep backin' up, right off that cliff! [SPEED] I can't let him get Pops' designs written on that windshield; I can't! [grunts] [gasps] [ACE] You smashed the designs! What did ya do that for, huh?! Okay, kid... [grunts] [groans] [SPEEgrunts] [ACE screams] [thud] I'd better get back into the race, and fast! [SPRITLE] Go, Speed, go! [TRIXIE] Go! You've got to win the money, Speed! [ANNOUNCER] The leading cars are fast approaching the finish of the Sword Mountain Race! In just seconds, you'll see them rounding the final curve. Stand by! The first car coming down the home stretch is car number 2, driven by Skulluggery! And coming up fast... ...is the Mach 5, --driven by Speed Racer! --[POPS gasps] He's all right! Speed's all right! The windshield's been smashed! [ANNOUNCER] The Mach 5 wins! I've won the money. I won it. [GROUP cheering] [ANNOUNCER] Ladies and gentlemen, the official winner is Speed Rac-- Uh... Just a moment. Some bad news has just been handed to me. Due to the tactics and interference of a group of cars not officially entered, the results of the race have been cancelled! There is no winner and no losers! I'm sorry, folks, but you'll just have to forget the whole thing! And I was counting on that money! [DUGGERY chuckles] Too bad! That was tough luck, Speed. Gee, I'm sorry, Pops. But if I hadn't smashed the windshield, those men would've gotten your designs for the new Mach 5! I'm not saying a word about that. Huh?! [POPS chuckles] I'm glad you broke it to protect the designs, Speed, because I've got them right up here in my head. Gee, that's great, Pops! [laughs] You're a very clever man, Mr. Racer! And some of it's rubbed off on me! Right? [POPS] Hm... Well, Spritle, I hope so. Il intend to be the winner of the next race I'm in. You can count on it! [POPS] That's the way I like to hear you talk, Speed. The next race you're in-- Hey! Wait just a minute! BOTH gasp) Who gave you permission to be a racer, huh?! It's very difficult to be a racer. It takes training and experience! Don't think that because you won today, you've already become a professional racer! [SPEED] That's enough lecture for now, Pops. --[POPS] Huh?! --[SPEED] See ya later! [POPS] Speed! [GROUP laughing] Speed, you come back here!
