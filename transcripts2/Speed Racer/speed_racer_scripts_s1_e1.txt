 He's jamming down the pedal like he's never coming back Adventure's waiting just ahead Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer, go! [SPEED] You are watching the most advanced designed and one of the fastest racing cars in the world. It's called the "Mach 5." Watch it really go. [SPEED] The Mach 5 is the result of brilliant concept and design and hard work. It was built by one of the geniuses of the automotive industry: my father. And you're about to see just how the fabulous Mach 5 came to be. But first, let me demonstrate how well it handles.

 [engine revs] [ALL cheering] [PIT CREW A] Speed! What a race! [PIT CREW B] What a race, Speed! You were fantastic! [SPEEchuckles] Thanks! You had the race sewn up by the second lap, Speed! I've got to hand it to you! Someday, you'll be champion of the world! [PIT CREW D] Nobody can beat you! That was a great race you ran, Speed! You beat us fair and square! You're the best driver I've ever seen, Speed! [SPEED] Aw, thanks. How would you like to join my team as a professional racer? [SPEED] Huh? I don't know... Speed, you can race with all of us in the Grand Prix. I wish I could... [SPEED] ...but Pops doesn't want me to be a pro. Ohh... Your father's a top engineer working for our company, Speed. Maybe he'll change his mind if we ask him, huh? [SPEED] I doubt it... [PIT CREW A] Speed, join us, huh? [PIT CREW B] We need you, Speed. I wanna be a professional racer! l wanna be the top champion! I want that more than anything in the world! Hmm. You're a fast, skillful driver, Speed, and I do think you've got a good chance to realize your ambition. Just stick to it. Thanks, sir! Don't worry about that. You can't lose with this amazing car! It can do everything! It's a masterpiece of your father's! You should be proud of him, Speed. [SPEED] Oh, I am! But right now, he's working on making it better with an even faster engine and all kinds of other parts. It was true: Pops was going to improve the Mach 5. [POPS] This is the model of the latest engine I've designed. It will have more horsepower than any other car engine of its size. Using the latest metals, fuel, and ignition system, I can succeed in boosting the RPMs to 30,000. [PRESIDENT] Thirty thousand?! If I didn't believe you, I'd say it was unbelievable! I've worked on it for a year. I hope you will give the go-ahead to actually build the engine according to this plan here. Don't waste time rebuilding it! What?! You haven't heard the rest of my plans for the Mach 5! I've heard enough, Mr. Racer! How can you be against it when you haven't even heard the rest of the plan I worked on all year?! I don't believe the plans can work! I'm a liar? Mr. Racer! [POPS] Is that what you're calling me?! Oh! Sorry, sir... [PRESIDENT] And you, Mr. Van Ruffle, you'd better calm down! But, Mr. President, I'm chief engineer at this company! I've been working on engine designs for years; I know what will work and won't work, and I say Mr. Racer's designs won't work! You're claiming my engine won't work before you've even studied my design! I don't have to study the whole thing! Your idea to redesign the Mach 5 is pretty bad because I don't think your car was too hot to begin with! You've gone about the whole thing in the wrong way! Mr. President, all I ask is that you develop my plans and give the car a try. I can't do that without the unanimous agreement of this board. If the car turns out to be a failure, do you think this company should have to pay for your incompetence, eh?! So that's your decision. All right. You've had your chance, and I'm not going to ask you for another. Glad to see you leave, Mr. Racer. Good riddance! [POPS] I'll rebuild the Mach 5 myself and I'll prove that my design will work. [VAN RUFFLE] We'll see, we'll see! Oh, we'll see... [chuckles] [SPEED] And so, Pops quit his job that day, and I drove him toward home. Gee, Pops, maybe you shouldn't have quit your factory job. I wouldn't've if they'd let me rebuild the car. Why didn't they give you the go ahead after all the work you put into the plans? One of the board members was jealous and didn't even wanna look at my designs, and the board wouldn't give me the go ahead, so I blew up. I'm gonna forget about driving on a team. - What?! - Nothing, Pops. Maybe I'm wrong about rebuilding the Mach 5. Maybe it would be a failure... And it also might turn out to be the best racing car in the world. [POPS] Hmm... [BIKER A] After 'em! You boys trying to take up the whole road?! Hey! Come back here! Come back He took the plans! Thanks for the plans, Pops! Give them back to me! You won't get away with them! How can we stop them? Pops, take the wheel. [POPS] No, Speed! Now, give me those plans! [BIKER A] Let me go, we'll crash! [SPEED] Give them to me! [BIKER A] What're you doing?! I'll lose control! [SPEED] I want those plans back! [BOTH grunting] [BIKER A] You take 'em! Bye-bye, and thanks! Come back here! Those plans don't belong to you! Hey! Stop! Stop, or I'll stop you! Hey! [BIKER B] Hey, I can't see, let go! Take 'em! [BIKER C] Thanks, and so long! Unhand me! [gasps] [BIKER C screaming] [BIKER D] Look out! [BIKERS yelping] Okay, now I'm gonna give you a taste of the medicine you deserve! As former champion of the Westside Grunters and Groaners, I promise you're in for a lot of groaning! [BIKERS growl] Uh-oh! [BIKER F growling] [BIKER F squealing] He's even tougher than he talks! [BIKER E] Oh yeah? [BIKER E yelping] [SPEED] Oh! It's Trixie! Hey, Trixie, Trixie! I'm down here! [SPEED] Some motorcyclists are racing up the road! See if you can catch them! [SPEED] Pops' plans were stolen. How could he've been so careless, Speed? [SPEED] Trixie, hurry! I'm going. I'll try to find the men. [laughing] [POPS] Ooh... [BIKER G] Huh? --Hi. --[BIKER G yelling] [BIKER G screaming] [squeals] [yells] That's the way, Speed! You're a chip off the old block! Show 'em they can't fool with racers! [groans] [gasps] [laughing] [screaming] [groaning] Tell Pops next time he shouldn't give those plans away so easily. Don't worry, Trixie, these plans for the Mach 5 are the most valuable thing we've got. To me, Speed's more valuable. [POPS laughing] Save some for me! [CHIM CHIM babbles] [POPS] Somebody tried to steal the plans, so that must mean that they're valuable. Don't you think so? Yes, but now that you've quit your job, you won't know what to do with yourself. And I know how you like to keep busy. How about remodeling my kitchen, rebuilding the garage, and planting some shrubbery. Hey, what a groovy idea, Pops! And I'll help you with everything! Okay, but first, I'm gonna work on remodeling the Mach 5 myself, and prove to them at the factory that it really works. [POPS laughing] But where will you get the money for the parts you need to rebuild the car? [POPS] Money... Hmm... Of course, if you worked hard, I'm sure you could finish the job. Sure, Pops, don't be discouraged. Well, I am! Where will I get the money I'm gonna need? [POPS groaning] [music playing] Quiet! [SPRITLE crying] Here, Spritle, here's a whole new batch of cookies. [SPRITLE giggles] [crying] [POPS] Ohh... Driving me insane! [VAN RUFFLE] You stoneheads! Don't tell me you're sorry! [BIKER A] But we are sorry, Mr. Van Ruffle. Speed's strong, and he got help from the sky in the form of a helicopter. What kind of excuse is that?! It's ridiculous! [MAN chuckles] I figured those guys would botch the job, and they did. Gimme 5,000 clams, and I'll get the plans. You charge $5,000?! You, sir, are kidding. --[MAN] Oh no. --Oh yeah? [MAN] Ace Ducey doesn't kid. If you want those plans, it'll cost you 5,000 clams. If you don't want 'em, forget it. All right, it's a deal. You'll have the plans for the Mach 5. [SPEED] I won't be a professional racer. Instead, I'll go to work and earn enough money so that Pops will be able to rebuild the Mach 5. [BOY humming] Hiya, Sparky. Oh, hi, Speed! This is a groovy heap, isn't it? [SPEED] Yeah. <i>The engine in there is a V8 with double overhead cam; Hey, what's the matter? What're you lookin' so sad about? I'm selling my car... [SPARKY] Huh?! Selling the Mach 5?! [SPEED] Mm-hm. Oh, come off it. Your father's against you becoming a professional racer, but you don't have to sell your car. It's not that, Sparky, it's just that I need the money. You need money? Why don't you tell me what this is all about? I wanna give it to Pops so he can build the super engine. I get it, Speed, but they told him at the factory the engine wouldn't work. I want Pops to build the engine, Sparky. I know how you feel, Speed, but read this before you do anything. "A Trial Race across Sword Mountain, five thousand bucks to the winner." So why don't you enter it? Pops would blow a gasket if I did... [SPARKY] But, Speed, wouldn't it be worse if you sold the Mach 5? You're right! I'll enter! Now you're being smart, Speed, but Sword Mountain's gonna be a tough course to drive, so I'll fix the Mach 5 for climbing mountains. That'll be great! Thanks. [POPS] You should knock before you come in. Who are you anyway? My name's Ace Ducey. And what do you want? [ACE] Your designs for rebuilding the Mach 5. [POPS] You can't have 'em. [ACE] Get over there. I'm just gonna help myself. Stay outta the way! [POPS] You're not going to get them, Mr. Ducey. [ACE] Oh, no? We'll see about that. Where'd you hide those plans? C'mon, where are they? [SPEED] Huh? I'll be back to get what I want. Who was that? He came to get my plans for rebuilding the Mach 5. He carried a gun! Oh, he did, huh? [POPS] He's dangerous, Speed! Let him go! [POPS] Using invisible ink and drawing the designs on this windshield glass was a brilliant idea. Nobody'll think of looking there! [POPS chuckles] [SPARKY] Okay! The Mach 5's all ready for mountain racing, Speed! Great! Now I wanna take it out for a road test. [SPARKY] Go! Wow, one minute and 34 seconds. Great! Did you see that, Trixie? He was really moving! [SPEED] Huh...? Ah... Hey, that car belongs to Duggery! --[TRIXIE] Duggery! --He races dirty! What's he doing to him? [gasps] [yelping] [SPRITLE, TRIXIE scream] [tires screeching] --[TRIXIE] Speed! --[SPARKY] You okay, Speed? Are you hurt?! [SPRITLE] Speedy. Talk to us, Speedy. [SPARKY] Hey, Speed. [groaning] [SPRITLE, SPARKY] Speed! Speed! [SPARKY] What's the big idea, Duggery?! Now Speed won't be able to enter the Sword Mountain race! Speed's going to be a professional racer? That's very interesting. You told him. Ooh! I forgot it was secret. I would've beaten you anyway, Speed, so you're lucky you won't be competing! So long! You were planning to be in a professional race? Pops isn't gonna like it! He's not supposed to know! Don't tell him, Spritle! He wants to win money so Pops can build the new engine. [TRIXIE] Oh, I see. I won't tell Pops, and don't you either, Chim Chim! [ALL laughing] [SPEEsighs] [SPARKY whistling] [SPEED] Put her on. [SPARKY] Okay! There. Now the Mach 5 has Pops' special grip tires system for mountain areas. How can you lose? Uh-oh. There's one thing missing; there's no windshield! Let's forget about it, Sparky. I'll just have to race without any glass on the car. Don't be foolish, Speed, you need the protection. There isn't time to go looking for it. But it'll be dangerous without glass. Here's the windshield glass. [SPEED] Huh? Nice goin', Spritle! That's not my glass, though. That belongs to Pops. Don't worry about it, Speed. We'll take care of Pops. [phone rings] [POPS] Pops speaking. [SPRITLE] Hi, Pops, is it okay if Speed borrows your windshield glass for a little while? [POPS] Why does he want it?! Where is Speed?! Huh?! [SPRITLE] He's going to race at Sword Mountain. Ah! I shouldn't have told Pops that. [POPS] He took my windshield, huh?! I wonder what Pops is so sore about? [POPS] I've drawn the designs in invisible ink on that windshield, and now, if the glass is broken, those plans will be gone forever. Ah! Clever of you to hide those designs on that windshield. It makes my job easier. To get them, all I have to do is take his car. You'd better not! [POPS grunts] [ACE chuckles] I'm going to win this race, Speed, and those 5,000 bucks will be mine. You'd better not count on them, Duggery. Get ready! It's about to start! This is gonna be some ride, Chim Chim. [ANNOUNCER] All drivers stand by. When the flag is lowered, all drivers will run to their cars and start. Racing positions on the track will be determined by quick starts and getaways. Get ready. The flag will be lowered and the race will begin in exactly 15 seconds. [POPS grunting] Call off the race? Why should we do that? Because if you don't, there's going to be a disaster. They'll do anything to get my plans. Call it off! [CROWcheering] [engine revs] [tires squeal] [POPS groaning] Speed, watch out for Duggery! [screams] [CROWshouting] [gasps] [ACE] Our target's car five. We want its windshield. The other cars are gonna be in the way. Get rid of them! [SPEED] Huh? I dunno who's driving those new cars in the race, but they're looking for trouble. I don't want any of 'em trying to wreck me. Look, Chim Chim, we're in for it! Ah! You'd better do as I say, otherwise, I'll smash you right off the course! All 1 want is your windshield glass. Give it to me, or I promise you'll never reach the finish line! [SPEED] There's only one reason he wants the glass: I'll bet Pops hid the design on it. C'mon, take it off if you can! [ACE] That fool of a kid. [yelps] [NARRATOR] Speed is in the most desperate race of his life. Will he finish it, or will it finish him?
