 if you don't have me as your assistant. [NARRATOR] And here come Speed's kid brother, Spritle, with Chim Chim. [gasps] [SPRITLE] Hop in, Chim Chim. [POPS] Spritle... There's no room for you and Chim Chim in the Mach 5. I built that car to hold only two people, see? Hey, Trixie, I know every part of the car. After all, I'm the mechanic. So let me ride in the race with Speed. [TRIXIE] Oh, no! I know every part of the car just as well as you do. I'm able to change tires fast and make all the repairs. Those jobs are much too tough for a girl. [TRIXIE] Is that so?! Listen, Sparky. I can do everything in the Mach 5 that you can do. But this is the most important race we've ever been in! Let me ride! No, I'm going to be the assistant. But this race'll be tough for a girl. I can be tough if I have to. Get out! No! I'm riding! [TRIXIE gasps] Put me down! Sparky, cut it out! The other racers are getting into position. BOTH gasp) [SPEED] This should be some race "cause any kind of car can be in it. [TRIXIE] That's right, cars from everywhere in the world. [SPARKY] And all kinds'a drivers, too! It's gonna be dangerous! [CROWD gasping, chattering] [MAN A] Hey, look what's coming! [ALL gasp] That car's more than 200 yards long! A Mammoth Car! [ANNOUNCER] Racing car fans, the officials will now inspect the entries in the great No Limit World Race. [OFFICIAL A] We wanna inspect your car, Speed. [ALL gasp] [SPARKY] But sir, the rules say any kinda car can race in the race. So why do you have to inspect the cars? [INSPECTOR] There's a good reason, Sparky. [SPARKY] Oh, Inspector Detector. How are you, Inspector? [INSPECTOR laughs] [INSPECTOR] Glad to see ya! Fifty million dollars in gold bars that were being kept in the National Bank were stolen last week. Yes, we read about it, sir. It's possible that someone might try to smuggle those gold bars out of the country some time during the race. We won't be able to search the cars once the race starts, so we'd better do it now. We can't afford to let the robbers get away with a fortune like that. But 50 million dollars in gold bars is an awful lot of gold, and it would take an awfully big car to smuggle it away in, wouldn't it? [INSPECTOR] Mm-hm. But the bank robbers are very clever, and they might've found a way to make the gold bars smaller. Or they might have melted the gold bars into the shape of a car. Cruncher Block's the head of the gang, and he'll stop at nothing. [SPEED] Golly! The Mach 5 passes the inspection, Inspector. - [INSPECTOR] Good. - l knew we would. Well. Good luck, Mach 5 Team. [SPEED] Thanks. So long, Inspector. Go right ahead, Inspector. Look around all ya want. [INSPECTOR] This car looks too big for the race. It doesn't seem fair to me. [DRIVER A] Well, it is fair. The rules said any kinda car can enter. We wanna give you a tour through the Mammoth Car. --Come on up! --[INSPECTOR] Okay. [INSPECTOR] Hmm. [DRIVER B] The main engine has 7,500 horsepower. Each Mammoth Wheel also contains an engine of 1,500 horsepower. Altogether, the Mammoth Car is driven by 30,000 horsepower. [INSPECTOR] Hmm. [DRIVER B] The Mammoth Car can travel over 500 miles an hour... ...on any kinda road. [DRIVER B] The brakes are magnetic and a single push of a button will stop the car. We have an army of mechanics to fix anything that might go wrong. [DRIVER B] The car is so powerful, we can't lose the race. [ALL gasp] Did you find out how many cylinders the engine has? And if it's equipped with a supercharger? The car is equipped with everything anybody can imagine. [SPARKY] Oh! Hm. Oh... Wow! [DRIVER B] Spying on us, eh? [DRIVER B] Heh? I was just tryin' to find out if the car's equipped with any special inventions that I don't know about. [DRIVER B] You wanna learn all about the Mammoth Car, eh? Okay, I'll be glad to show ya around. Come on! Right this way. [screaming] [SPARKY] Help! Hey, let me go! I was only kidding! [DRIVER B chuckles] Where's Sparky? [POPS] Hm? I don't know. I don't see him around anywhere. He might be up to mischief. I would be if I were him. Right? Right, Spritle. But you're not Sparky. Maybe I'll have to be Speed's assistant driver, so I better get into good shape. [yelps] [POPS] Ooh. and to think ll used to be known as Dragon Racer, the famous wrestler! [groans] [POPS] I'm ready... Sorry, but Speed needs a real groovy assistant, Pops. And right now, you couldn't even lift a monkey wrench! So long! [yelps] [ANNOUNCER] The race is about to begin. Start your engines! Here goes! Who's that? [SPEED] Huh? [NARRATOR] Unknown to Speed, this is his older brother, Rex, who ran away from home years ago. [yelping] [ANNOUNCER] Stand by... The gorgeous Miss Racing Car will lower the flag for the start of the 500 mile No Limit World Race! [trumpets playing] [CROWD cheering] - [POPS] Go! Go! Go! Go, boy! - [SPRITLE] Go! Come on, Speed! [whistle blows] [groaning] [RACER X] Come on, Sparky. Get up. [SPARKY] Huh? You look familiar. Tell me what happened. I was looking at the Mammoth Car when its driver grabbed me, dragged me in here, and knocked me out! The Mammoth Car's driver? [whimpering] The Mammoth Car's catching up to us! It may be too tough for us to beat, Speed. But we've got to try! [TRIXIE screams] [whistle blows] [screams] BOTH gasp) [TRIXIE gasps] Come on! Let's help the engineer to clean up! [TRIXIE] Oh, look. [coughing] Is that clumsy monster supposed to be a car?! [NARRATOR] Mechanics quickly repair the Mammoth Car. And it's ready to continue the race. The car's pulling away! Let's go! That's very peculiar. The Mammoth Car was hardly scratched in the crash, so why did the mechanics have to repair it? Trixie, I'll bet there's some kind of mysterious secret to the whole thing. A secret? I wonder what it could be. Let's use the robot camera! I'll adjust it for x-rays and put it on the reflex timer. It should tell us the secret. [TRIXIE] The x-ray picture should tell us what the Mammoth Car's carrying. The camera's all ready for flight. Okay! I'll pull out the robot. [NARRATOR] The robot carrier speeds ahead with the x-ray camera which will shoot through metal, and may be able to reveal the secret cargo of the Mammoth Car. [DRIVER B] Huh? [DRIVER B] A spy! And now the robot's back. [TRIXIE] Ah. Oh! Somebody shot it! [SPEED] They sure did! Them! [NARRATOR] The Mammoth Car sends a radio signal. [NARRATOR] The signal travels halfway around the world to reach the luxurious secret headquarters of the owner of the Mammoth Car, the notorious Cruncher Block. Speed Racer sent a flying robot camera to spy on the Mammoth Car? I see... Better get rid of him. Now listen to me. You've got to stay in the race because it's the only way you'll be able to carry that 50 million bucks in gold bars out of the country. [TRIXIE] I don't see any other cars, Speed. Now the race is between the Mammoth Car and us. And I'm beginning to suspect that they may be carrying the gold. [SPEED] Hang on! Speed! Look! [SPEED] Huh? [screams] [NARRATOR] It's Speed's older brother, Rex, in disguise as Racer X. [SPEED] Another car! [NARRATOR] Rex spreads oil on the road. [THUG A yelps] [screaming] [engine revs] Thanks to Racer X, we can go on now! Go! [POPS] I see... So the driver of the Mammoth Car slugged you, huh? They'll stop at nothing to win. So we've got to catch a plane to where they are and try to help Speed and Trixie. That was the last plane leaving for the north? But we've got to fly there! [TICKET AGENT] Well, unless you can sprout wings and fly there by yourself, you'll have to wait for our next plane, which leaves tomorrow morning. [POPS] But my son, Speed Racer, is in the big race and he may need our help. [TICKET AGENT] But I can't help you. We don't have any more planes. [POPS] Oh, no? What's that big thing sitting out there? Don't tell me it's a bird! No, sir, but it's privately owned. It belongs to Cruncher Block. [POPS] Hmm... My special Motorcycle Mayhem Team failed to stop the Mach 5. But once we fly up there, I'll personally see that the job's done permanently! [SPRITLE] Uh-oh! [NARRATOR] Unbeknown to Cruncher Block, Speed Racer's kid brother, Spritle, and Chim Chim have stowed aboard the plane. [CRUNCHER laughs] I always get hungry when I'm up to skullduggery. Give me a sandwich! BOTH gasp) Where is it?! You old pig! You ate it yourself, eh?! Look! The Mammoth Car's beginning to slow down! It's too big and heavy for this mountain road. Maybe now we'll get a chance to catch up to it! [TRIXIE screams] They're after us! [SPEED] Huh?! I think we'll be safe now. The path we made will be too narrow for them to follow us on. Oh! Here comes the Mammoth Car again! I've got to find some way to stop it! I'm gonna try to rip those tires off. - [TRIXIE screams] - [SPEED] Hang on! [screams] BOTH gasp) I'm gonna try to get away from them. [SPEED] Now! [BOTH scream] [NARRATOR] The amazing Mach 5 is a car that can do many things. But can it pull Speed Racer and Trixie from the depths of this northern lake? And if so, will they be able to escape the Mammoth Car?
