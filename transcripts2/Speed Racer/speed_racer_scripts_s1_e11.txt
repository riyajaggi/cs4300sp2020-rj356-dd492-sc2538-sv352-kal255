 He's jamming down the pedal like he's never coming back Adventure's waiting just ahead Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer, go! [SPEED] This is the second day of the most dangerous race in the world. And this most treacherous part of the entire course is so full of landslides caused by the heavy rain, that some drivers were too afraid to go on. But six of us, Racer X, myself, and members of the Car Acrobatic Team decided to continue, and we drew lots to see which of us would go first. It would be increasingly hazardous

 for each man who followed. What position'll you be in? [SPEED] Last! I'll be the one to make it. [SPEED] No one had been able to cross the chasm, and now it was Racer X's turn to try. [SPEED] It's my turn now, and I've got to make it. [NARRATOR] Meanwhile, in a nearby lodge, Sparky, Trixie, and Spritle watch the storm and wait anxiously for news of the race. According to this bulletin, not much information is available because of the storm, but apparently, more than a dozen cars, including members of the Car Acrobatic Team and the Mach 5, have had their way blocked near Yarning Chasm pass. The racing committee is considering changing the course to a less dangerous area before the cars and drivers are completely wiped out. [TRIXIE] Oh... I hope Speed"ll be all right. I hope he won't try to go ahead. I'm not worried. He took my good luck charm along in the car with him, and it'll bring him good luck, right, Chim Chim? Won't it, Sparky? Say he'll be all right! [SPRITLE wailing] [ALL gasp] Aren't you men supposed to be in the race? We barely managed to make it back from Yarning Chasm Pass. The road's impassible. Do you know what happened to some of the other drivers in the race? Most of them will never come back. [gasps] They tried to make it from one cliff to the other and failed. [groans] You said they didn't make it? Their cars were wrecked? There was nothing left of them including the cars of the Car Acrobatic Team. They were stupid to try to go ahead when everybody could see that they wouldn't be able to make it. Poor Speed. [CHIM CHIM gibbers] All right, Sparky, come on. [SPARKY] Where? Speed might need help! I wanna try to help him! Hey, you'd better wait till this storm blows over! Don't worry; we'll be all right. But as soon as the weather's calmed down, we'll send out a searching party to look for him. [TRIXIE] I'm sorry, but by then, it might be too late. I'm going now. [INFORMANT] No, you'll never get through. You'd better wait. I've got to try to help Speed right now! Let go of my arm. Hey, no matter what you say, we're gonna try to help my brother. Let's go, come on! The storm's bad. Stay! ll won't let you out there. [grunting] [INFORMANT yelps] Come back here! [SPRITLE] Let's go! You'll be sorry! Poor Speed... I hope we find him... [engine sputters] [gasps] There's not a drop of gas left in the tank! Oh... [TRIXIE] Speed! Speed! [TRIXIE] Oh, Speed! [cackles] [gasps] I am not Speed as Speed Racer no longer exists. [shrieking] [gasping] [groaning] [SPEED] Oh, my eyes! It hurts my eyes. [SPEED] What's the matter with me? I can't see. It's Spritle's good luck charm! [SPRITLE] If you carry it with you, it'll bring you good luck and you'll win. [SPEED] Where's the Mach 5? I've got to find it. Where is it? [SPEED] I hope the Mach 5 hasn't been damaged. I'll go on with the race even though I can't see. I've got to beat the Car Acrobatic Team. [SPEED] Where is it? Where's the Mach 5? [thunk] [SPEED] Who's there? Huh? Snake. So you're still alive, huh, Speed? I'm surprised that after that crash you are. What's your story, Speed? Don't tell me the Mach 5 isn't running anymore. [SPEED] Where is the car? You're unable to see now? Well, isn't that just too bad. Snap out of it. [crying] It looks as if I'm gonna win the Alpine Race. You better wait here till somebody rescues you. I'm glad to say your racing days are over for good, Speed. Heh. I guess I proved I'm a much better driver than you, Speed. I'm on my way to victory! [SPEED gasps] [NARRATOR] Racer X. Unknown to Speed, this is his older brother Rex, who ran away from home years ago. I smell the oil of the Mach 5's engine. I started it. But how am I going to drive without seeing the road? I recognize the sound of that car. It can only belong to Racer X and that must mean that he's come back into the race. Well, so have I! Here goes! [gasps] [RACER X] Keep at it, Speed. You've got a chance to make it... ...if you're lucky. I'm stuck. The grip tires seem to be broken. [RACER X] Easy, Speed. Ease it out gently. [RACER X] Come on, Speed. You can't give up now. It sounds as if Racer X is leaving and he won't give me any help. I'm on my own. [RACER X] I can't leave him there like that, but what choice do I have? What can I do? That was a bad crash. I hope he hasn't been hurt. [SPEED] Racer X! Racer X! Where are you? Racer X! Where are you? [groans] Over here, Speed... He sounds badly hurt. But where is he? Racer X! Here! Over here! [SPEED] I'm coming. [RACER X] Speed, you're a brave, young man. I'm proud to have you for a brother. [SPEED] Where are you, Racer X? I can't find you. Racer X, are you hurt badly? I think my legs have been broken, Speed. Well, hang on to me. I'll try to get you into the Mach 5. Speed, don't bother about me, you need help yourself. Your eyes must hurt you. Neither one of us will be able to go on with the race. Snake Oiler is the only one of the Car Acrobatic Team who's continuing in the race. Snake Oiler, huh? I wanna beat him more than anything in the world. Your car's the only other one left, but you can't see and ll can't even walk, so Snake's liable to win. But, Speed, I have an idea that just might work. Huh? You be my legs, and at the same time, I'll be your eyes. [SPEED] Oh, I get it! You and I will be a team. Yes. Maybe we can overtake Snake and win. Come on. [RACER X] My legs are perfectly all right, but this is the only way ll can help my brother Speed. No Mach 5 or Speed. [SPARKY] Uh-oh. Maybe the Mach 5's been completely wrecked. I feel that somewhere down there, Speed's all right. I think so, too, because he has my good luck charm. [SPARKY] We'll follow the course. Keep a sharp eye out for him. There's the Mach 5! [SPRITLE, SPARKY] And there's Speed! Left. Now ten degrees right. Get ready, here comes another turn to the right. Fifteen degrees to the right. [TRIXIE] Speed. Speed! Go ahead, Trixie. [TRIXIE] Are you all right, Speed? [SPEED] I... It's my eyes. [TRIXIE] What's the matter with your eyes?! Uh, I'm perfectly all right, don't worry. Nothing's wrong with them. [TRIXIE] I think you're fibbing to me, Speed. Make a left. Who's that riding with you, Speed? [SPEED] Racer X. He hurt his legs in a crash. Hi, Speed, I'm up here, too! [SPARKY] Me, too! [CHIM CHIM yells] [SPEED] All of you, huh? That's just great. Now all I have to do is beat Snake Qiler. I might be able to catch up to him in the next few minutes. I'll meet you at the finish line, Trixie, how 'bout it? [TRIXIE] I'll be waiting for you, Speed. Good luck! Faster! The final check point is 250 yards up ahead. Put your brakes on. I'm glad to see you reached here safely. Now, why don't you both take a break? [SPEED] I don't want one. But, Speed, you need a rest. Have you seen the Car Acrobatic Team's car? A car passed by this checkpoint within the hour. Thanks! Hang on! Are you all right, Speed? Yes. I won't rest until Snake's been beaten. Well, then, you'll have to hurry. Give her the gun. That's it. Give her even more. Even faster! I see him! He's just ahead! At last, Speed, we've caught up to him. The Mach 5! And I thought I was the only driver left in the race. You'll never be able to follow me over this chasm. Go ahead, Speed. It's your turn to try to get over that without crashing down to those rocks in the bottom! Speed! There's a broken bridge up ahead! Use your brakes! Snake managed to get across it, didn't he? So will! How? That bridge is falling apart! Speed, you'd better use the brakes before it's too late and we smash up! Tell me when we get to the broken bridge. I'm gonna try to get across it. The Acrobatic Team's cars have special equipment for flying. The Mach 5 can't do it! Use the brake! [SPEED] I'm giving her the gas! Stop! Speed, we can't make it! Jam on the brakes! Quick! You made it. I don't think you would've been able to do it with your eyes open. There was no other way. I had to make it. Now I've got to win. [ANNOUNCER] The Alpine Race is almost over. And, because of the terrific storm and the dangerous course, out of the starting lineup of 86 cars, only two cars are still in the race. One of them is car number 12, driven by Snake Oiler of the Car Acrobatic Team. And the other is the Mach 5 driven by Speed Racer. Ladies and gentleman, if you look to your left, you can see the remaining members of the Car Acrobatic Team waiting for the end of the race. [TEAM MEMBER A] Captain Terror! [CAPTAIN TERROR] Yes? I just got a report that Snake is way in the lead. Snake's my brother and he's going to bring a glorious victory to the Car Acrobatic Team. [CAPTAIN TERROR] We will be famous as the greatest racing team in the world! No one can beat us! Hurry, Snake! Bring us the crown of victory! It's hard to catch up to him. He's liable to win. If only I could see, I'd go even faster. But Speed, you mustn't give up. Why not? I don't think I have a chance of beating him. Speed, you still have a chance to win. I can see something you can't. Oil is leaking from Snake's car. Oil? If he keeps on going at his present speed, he's gonna blow up. He may notice the trouble though, and take time out to stop the leak. I don't think he'll even notice it. Snake's paying too much attention to the road in front of him. Then he'll be wiped out if his car blows up. Yes, it might be the end of him. But we're not gonna help him, not if you wanna win the race. It wouldn't be right. I've got to try to warn him. It's only fair. Okay. You're doing the right thing, Speed, in trying to warn him. Thanks. Huh?! The Mach 5 again... And it's gaining on me. ll can't pull away from it. Snake, be careful! There's something wrong with your engine. You're leaking oil very badly! I'm not fallin' for that trick. I'm not gonna stop. Snake, I'm not lying! He won't believe you, and you've done your best to warn him. Hang on. [ANNOUNCER] And now approaching the finish line is car number 12 driven by Snake Oiler. It looks as if he'll be the winner. Oh! But here comes the Mach 5 with Speed Racer at the wheel! Look at them go! Go, Speed, go! Go! C'mon, Speed! You can do it! I'm gonna win! I'm gonna beat Speed! [laughs] BOTH gasp) [screams] [SPEED] Snake wouldn't listen... [ALL shouting] - [SPARKY] You won, Speed! - [SPRITLE] You did it! You drove a magnificent race, Speed Racer, and you fully deserve to be the winner and champion. Now go to the hospital where the doctors will make your eyes well again. We will never forget this race and our defeat by the Mach 5 and Speed Racer. [groans] We'll get revenge... [CAPTAIN TERROR] Snake is right. There will be other races and chances for vengeance. We shall plan for the day when once again, we will compete against Speed Racer, and on that day, we shall not fail. Let's go home. [RACER X] Speed, you could be a great driver, but you can also be a great man. You value a life even higher than victory. The world needs more people like you. I'm proud to have you as a brother. Have you seen Racer X? I've got to find him to thank him. I saw him in the Mach 5 only a few minutes ago. Nobody's in the car now. There isn't? That means he was able to walk away from it. His legs weren't broken. He just told me that so I'd let him help me drive. He deserves this trophy, not me. Oh, Speed! All that matters to me is that you made it safely. Now let's go to the hospital and get your eyes taken care of. [NARRATOR] Speed has just won the most dangerous race in the world, but even more danger and thrills lie just ahead.
