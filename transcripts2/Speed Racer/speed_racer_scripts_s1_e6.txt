 is ready to protect Speed. [RACER X] I've got to slow them down so Speed can get away. [screams] [screams] [RACER X] That'll keep them out of mischief for a while. [SPEED] I wouldn't be here in danger right now if I hadn't stopped the Mach 5 yesterday to help Mr. Clepto, uh, kind-hearted old Mr. Light Fingers Clepto, Jr., to get the top up on his ancient Model T, the same car that was left to him when his father was shot down by gangsters years ago. Mr. Clepto and his granddaughter, Suzie, gave me dinner at his home, where I met all his adopted children, and where he showed me how he took care of the ancient Model T his father had left to him. He also showed me the old engine he took out of the car. The engine the mysterious forces were now looking for. [THUGS screaming] [THUG A] Get out of the way! Now, talk. Who gave you the orders to attack me? Who's behind this whole thing? Come on, talk! [SPEED gasps] I'll bet the boss is up there. [BLAGGARD] Right, sonny. Now let go of my man. [SPEED] Who are you? [BLAGGARD] Heh, heh! Look behind you. [SPEEgasps] [TINY yells] [CLEPTO] Speed! Speed, wake up, Speed! [gasps] It's a fine mess we're in, Speed. [SPEED] Where are we? ICLEPTO] Who knows? But ll don't like it. Just look around. [CLEPTO] That's a Model T just like mine. And it's in mint condition! Uh! That is my car! I'm more interested in finding out where we are and how we might be able to get out of here. Ah! This might be a way out! [BLAGGARcackling] Old man, you are Light Fingers Clepto, Jr., the son of Light Fingers Clepto. What?! How'd you discover that? I've got a spy network throughout the world. I find out everything worth finding out. You're nothing but a thief! You stole my precious Model T! I always get whatever I want. Now tell me, what did you do with the original engine that was in the car? [CLEPTO] Why should I tell you? What're you planning to do with it? I don't plan to do anything with that engine except read the secret numbers on it because they'll tell me where a billion dollars in gold was hidden by your father! What?! A billion in gold? [BLAGGARD] That's right! That's why I busted out of Sung Along Prison, so I could get my hands on that loot. Then you must be the escaped convict, Tongue Blaggard! Right! Now tell me where the Model T engine is or Tiny goes to work. BOTH gasp) I'll never tell you where that engine is! Never! Tell me! Don't hit him! I'll tell you where it is! No! Don't tell him anything, Speed! Tell us! [CLEPTO] No, Speed, don't! The engine doesn't exist. I destroyed it. You destroyed it, eh?! But ll remember the numbers! [gasps] Let's go to Misty Valley and split up the loot three ways. We'll be glad to share it. If you won't share it, I won't tell you what was on the engine, so think it over, Mr. Blaggard. Think it over carefully. I wouldn't share anything with a man like that. [SPEED] Shh! I was just trying to save us from Tiny. The first chance we get, we'll turn Blaggard and his gang over to the police and you'll be able to keep that billion for yourself. Well, the treasure did belong to my father, so now it's rightfully mine. But I'm willing to give you enough money so that you'll be able to enter the Multi-Peak Race! [SPEED] Shh! I accept the deal to split it three ways. It's late and Speed isn't home yet. I suppose he's still training for the Multi-Peak Race. He must love training. [phone rings] [POPS] Hello? Oh, hello, Speed! What's that? You're going for a long ride with a friend and you won't be home until tomorrow? Well, that's all right, I guess. Good work, Speed. Tell Trixie the ring I wanted to get for her costs over $650, so she might as well forget it. I'll have to get a lot more money before I'll be able to afford it. Okay, you've said enough, kid. Speed's having a little trouble about pocket money. He should know the money troubles I have. He's talking about paying for a ring for Trixie. He must be kidding. We haven't even enough money to send him to the Multi-Peak Race. [laughs] They're guarding us in the front and in the back. We won't have a chance to call the police. Don't worry, Mr. Clepto. I sent out a code signal to Trixie to start looking for me, and now I'll talk to her by radio. Trixie, come in. Wait. Something's wrong. Some tubes are missing. The radio won't work. At the rate we're goin', we won't reach Misty Valley before midnight. Why hurry? We'll spend the night at that lodge up there. [THUG A] Good idea, Boss! [snoring] Hey! Wake up! The racer kid skipped out! [THUGS chattering] [BLAGGARD] Tiny! [TINY grunts] Shall we take a little midnight stroll out there? [RADIO] Hello. Hello. This is the police. Who's calling and where? [SPEED] Forget it. Checking up to see if your car's all right? You're a very conscientious kid. [SPEED] Oh-- I, uh-- That is, I-- This steering wheel's got lots of buttons on it. Let's see... That's the automatic jack. It raises the car several feet so it can be serviced. What's this for? The B stands for "belt tires" for driving in mountain areas. That's a groovy idea. Hey. Which button is for the weapons? Sorry, but the Mach 5 doesn't carry them. It was built for racing driving and that's all. [BLAGGARD] Hm... And what's this button here? [SPEED] That's for a remote controlled homing robot. Is this the remote control? Yes, but please don't fool around with the homing robot. [BLAGGARchuckles] It's like playing with a toy airplane. I haven't had this much fun since I was a kid. Fly up! Down! What's this? I'll try it. [SPEED] Uh-uh, don't touch it. Crazy, that homing robot can really fly. [BLAGGARchuckles] Now it's gone! [SPEED] It's on its way home to the family, but they won't know where I am. If only I'd been able to give the homing robot a message to carry. [bell ringing] [POPS] All right! Take it easy; I can hear ya ringing the bell. Who can it be at this time of night? Oh! Trixie! Speed was supposed to take me to a party tonight, but he stood me up! He never showed up at all! Where is he? I wanna give him a piece of my mind! [POPS] Hm... That's funny, he phoned me this afternoon to tell me he was going on a trip. He told you he was going away?! But he gave me a message for you. He said you can forget about the ring. Forget about the ring, Pops? He said it costs over $650, so at least for now, you might as well forget about the ring. Over $650? Wait just a minute! What're you so excited about? Pops, that message was a code! What do you mean a code? And a couple of zeros and it indicates the red zone of his tachometer. You're right. And besides, I don't know anything about a ring Speed's supposed to buy for me. The code must mean that he's in danger. [SPRITLE] Mommy, I'm hungry. Could I have something to eat? Another midnight snack? [MOM] Spritle, what are you doing up at this hour? [SPRITLE] The homing robot came home and woke me up. [POPS] What?! The robot's here! [SPRITLE] Ice cream makes a great midnight snack. I'll take ice cream! Milk is better. [TRIXIE] Uh-oh! There's no note inside it! That's not like Speed to send it without any message in it. [POPS] Hmm... But there seems to be some red clay on the outside of it. Oh, Spritle! What're you and Chim Chim up to? [TRIXIE] Hmm... [CLEPTO] Ah, what could go wrong on a beautiful morning like this? I can think of a million things, Mr. Clepto. I thought I heard a helicopter last night. Did you hear it? Uh-uh. I slept like a baby last night. Or rather, like an old man. [chuckles] [SPEElaughs nervously] [SPEED] Oh, well. [SPEED] But maybe that was Trixie searching for us last night, and she couldn't find us. [THUG B] Hey! Hey, Mr. Blaggard, look! We found one of the natives of Misty Valley. [BLAGGARD] Ah, good. We can use her as a guide so we don't get lost. Why do you strangers want to go into Misty Valley? Listen, girlie, just show us around and don't ask questions. I've better things to do than to act as a guide for the likes of you! We'll pay ya money. Oh! That's different! [giggles] Oh boy, are they greedy around here. What do we need her for? We can look for the treasure alone. This kid will tell you the directions, so you travel with him. Hey! Now wait just a minute, buster! Ooh! I'm going to enjoy this kid. My name is Lana and you're the most handsome boy I've seen in this valley. Someday, I'm planning to visit the big city, and it would be groovy if I had a handsome boy like you to show me around. I'd wear a fancy dress and comb my hair. Will you please stop talking? I'm tryna keep my mind on the road up ahead. Oh, well, the least I could do is point out some of the points of interest in the valley. Oh, look! Isn't that amazing? You mustn't miss that! [THUG C] Huh? [THUG C screams] Hey, what's the big idea? Now's your chance to get away. Hurry! [SPEED] Why are you helping us? [giggles] [SPEED gasps] Trixie! Hang on! [growls] [TRIXIE] Oh, there's no one back there! They've stopped following us. Trixie, how in the world did you find out where we were? I studied the bits of red clay on this homing robot and figured the only place where this clay can be found is Misty Valley. Pops is waiting for us in the village up ahead. [SPEED] Hi, Pops. We're safe thanks to Trixie figuring out where we were. Well, Pops, you might as well call the police now. [chuckles] [ALL gasp] Well, I'm glad to see all of you again. I've got a surprise for you in there. Show 'em, Tiny. [TRIXIE] Pops! You can't go anywhere! Even if you do get free, we're keepin' the helicopter. [gasps] [THUG D] Hm? Hey, come on out! Whoever you are! [BOTH snicker] [BLAGGARD] Okay, sonny, now you'd better take us to the treasure. [BLAGGARD] So you claim that it's right around here, huh? [SPEED] Yes, sir. [BLAGGARD] What makes ya so sure? I think the markings on the engine stood for directions. And according to maps, this is where they indicated. Hey, Boss, there's an "X" mark back here. [BLAGGARD] Hm? An X? Aah, so there is. Okay, Tiny, move the rock aside. [grunting] Aah... Just look what we have down there. Tiny, move it out carefully. [ALL gasp] Okay, open it up. [BLAGGARchuckles] [CLEPTO gasps] Take a good look at that billion dollars, Clepto, because that's the last time you'll ever see it. What do you mean?! [BLAGGARD] I'm getting rid of all of you. I don't want you goin' straight to the police. This treasure belongs to me and only to me. You don't deserve a penny of the money! Hmph! That's what you think, girlie. Il deserve everything ll can steal. Okay, men, they're all lined up. Get every one of 'em! Get ready to fire. Ahh! It's a monkey attack! [monkeys gibbering] Chim Chim's the leader! [THUGS groaning, screaming] Who said a barrel of monkeys was fun?! I'll get that monkey... Huh?! [SPRITLE laughs] Spritle, what are you up to dressed like that?! You're liable to catch the sniffles! [SPRITLE] Pops! Show me what a good wrestler you are. Good idea, Spritle. I almost forgot I used to be a champ. That boss is mine! That's the beginning. [laughs] [POPS yells] Throw him, Pops! [gasps] [growls] Okay... Come on! I'm ready! Don't worry, Speed. I'll take care of him! [TINY growling] [gasps] Good work, Speed. That takes care of him. There aren't many more left. Ah! Hold it right there, all of you. One more move and I'll pull the trigger of this flamethrower. [BLAGGARlaughing] [SPEED] Racer X! You got here at the right second! [growls] [tires screech] [BLAGGARD] That kid's on my tail. I'll lay down some oil and cause him to crash. [screaming] [growls] [BLAGGARD] Now let's see him get outta this. The flames aren't having any effect on that car. I'll try water. [chuckling] [growls] Send the helicopter. I'm being chased by that kid! Okay, come out of there! [gasps] [BLAGGARD] So long! [laughs] [gasps] [BLAGGARD] Uhh... Uh! [BLAGGARcrying] Where's all the money my father left me? Where's the billion dollars? [SPEED] It's all turned into dust and blown away. I'm sorry, but maybe because the bills were buried in volcanic ground for so many years, they deteriorated. [CLEPTO] Hmm. Don't feel so bad, Speed. Inspector Detector has something to say. First of all, congratulations, Speed. Gee, thanks, Inspector. Speed, you were instrumental in the capture of one of the world's most dangerous criminals. And for that, there will be a reward of $100,000. [SPEED] Oh! Now you'll have enough money to enter the Multi-Peak Race! Isn't that wonderful? Oh, Speed, we're all so proud of you for what you've done! [chuckles] She's right, Speed. A great job. Grandpa! [CHILDREN laugh, cheer] Now don't worry, children. Although I didn't get the money, we'll make out all right. After all, who really needs money when they have such wonderful children? I'm gonna give my reward money to Mr. Clepto. He wants to start a home for homeless children, and the money's going to be a big help. And we'll all work hard to earn enough money to send you to the Multi-Peak Race, Speed. I'll even do some work for a change. [ALL laugh] [SPEED] Good bye, Mr. Clepto! [TRIXIE] Bye! [SPEED] Good luck! [NARRATOR] And so, thanks to Speed and Trixie and Spritle and Racer X, everything has turned out well. But more dangerous adventure lies ahead, in the next thrilling episode of Speed Racer Subtitles: Astro Nomenov Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer Go, Speed Racer, go!
