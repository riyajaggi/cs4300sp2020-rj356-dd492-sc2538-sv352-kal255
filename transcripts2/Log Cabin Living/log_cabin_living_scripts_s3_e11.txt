  NARRATOR: Building and living  in log cabins began with  early American settlers. These simple, boxlike structures  reflected the limited use of building materials  at the time. But not anymore. Oh, yeah. NARRATOR: All across America,  from New England to Hawaii... from the Rocky Mountains to  the Appalachian countryside... more and more people  are searching for log cabins... Oh, my God! ...unforgettable homes  framed by giant timbers...

 Oh, wow. ...cathedral ceilings  and dramatic views... where adventures truly begin. Whoo!  Awesome! This is  "Log Cabin Living." BRETT: Ready to catch some fish?  EMILY: Hopefully. AMY: We've got to keep  Jace out, though, huh?  [ Dog barks ] I think Jace wants  to go fishing. I think Jace wants to  go bad. NARRATOR: Brett and Amy enjoy  the Bayfield, Colorado, area where they currently reside but would love to move  into a log home in the woods  on the outskirts of town. Got it, Emily?  Good cast.

 EMILY: Yeah, I think.  Good cast. You're getting pretty good at that, you know it? We're pretty lucky  to be living up here. Currently, we live  in the town of Bayfield. We love the activities  that are close by. Within an hour,  we can be at 11,000 feet doing all the things  we love to do. We are hoping to find  a place outside of town, but not too far, where we can have  a little more room. If we do have a fireplace, I'll be happy to help you with wood. BRETT: You're going to have  to help me with wood. Thanks, buddy.  Thanks, buddy. NARRATOR: Today, the couple  will meet their Realtor, Justin Osborn,  to go over their budget and what they're looking for  in a log cabin. I specialize in selling rural properties  in Southwest Colorado. Sell a lot of farm and ranches  and cabins out in the woods. So remind me again, exactly, kind of what the key features are in the properties  that you're looking for. BRETT: Our wish list  for our cabin would include a modern,  updated place... With a big open kitchen,  at least three bedrooms. I have to have a garage. And a little bit  of land with privacy. Have that room to throw the ball for the dog, where we can wear him out. And have you thought about  what's kind of gonna be your maximum price range? Yeah, we have. I think $450,000  would be our max. I've definitely got  some good options for you to take a look at. NARRATOR: Justin has selected  several cabins near the activities that Brett  and Amy's family enjoys. There's the Creek Cabin  and the Ponderosa Cabin. But first, they'll tour  the Hillside Cabin, just minutes from fishing  at Lake Simpatico. JUSTIN: Welcome to  the Hillside Cabin. It seems pretty private  with all the trees. The Hillside Cabin  is 2,852 square feet. It's five bedrooms,  three bathrooms, sits on one acre. And it has direct access to the San Juan  National Forest. And the seller  is asking $400,000. Wow. Five bedrooms  and below budget. BRETT: I know we're here  to see the cabin. But since we're right here, I got to take a look in that garage first. Go right ahead. That's the space  I was looking for. Is that going to be  big enough for you? I think that'll work. AMY: The garage at the Hillside Cabin  is a four-car garage. And that is great. It is detached,  which is not ideal for me. But I don't even think  Brett noticed that. I can't wait  to see the inside. AMY: Oh, wow. This is really nice. I really do like the wood floor. Really glad it's not carpet. Really gives it that log cabin feel. BRETT:  Yeah, that rustic feel. The great room has some great rustic touches. Wood stove with brick behind it and stone underneath it. Oh, look at that view.  It is a good view. But there's  a lot of houses right down below  that that you can see. You're looking down  in everybody's backyard there. Yeah, that is true. Looks pretty modern  and updated. So it doesn't feel like we would need to do much, anyway. So that's --  that's a big bonus. Oh, wow.  This island is a lot bigger than I thought it would be  from the other side. The Hillside Cabin  has a great kitchen. It's got a big island  with lots of counter space. And it has lots of storage  with cabinets and drawers. I do like this window  over here. I did notice that  the countertops are the tile that you're not  a big fan of. Yeah, I noticed that, too. It's hard to roll out cookie  dough or pizza dough on a tile. Are you ready to go see a couple of the bedrooms? Yeah, that sounds great. Right around the corner here. Wow, talk about  a log cabin feel. Yeah, this definitely has that rustic feel in here. I like the rough cut trim around the doorways. I immediately noticed  the cabin touches in there, with the rough-cut cedar  and, of course, the decor in there. Emily would like this room. Just as it is.  Yep. The room just kind of feels small. Let's go see the next one. All right. Pretty small bedroom.  Yeah, it is pretty little. But it would work. It's got some nice  crown molding features. Definitely different decor  than the other. I noticed the flooring when we walked in, too. It's not real wood either.  Yeah. Even though the second bedroom doesn't have real wood floor, it is still better  than carpet. This is a nice bathroom.  It is. I really like the tilework  in the bathtub. The bathroom that the girls  would share is a nice size  and had great tile and stone and a window  to let in natural light. And we wouldn't really  have to change anything. Hey, what did you think  of the bedrooms? They're nice but  a little bit small. But they are updated, and there wouldn't be much work  to do in there at all. Let's go right upstairs.  All right. I really like the wood  on the stairs. Oh, wow.  This is a nice room. The upper level  of the Hillside Cabin has a great bedroom in it  with lots of space. And it has a great private porch  off the bedroom itself. There's a lot of light  in there. And it does feel quite open. Is there a bathroom  attached to this? Bathroom's right down  the hall here. It's not attached  to the bedroom. But it is immediately just right outside the bedroom door. So would that be  a shared bathroom? It's really gonna depend on how you would set this house up. There is another bedroom up here on this floor. But if your family  came to visit from Florida, we could potentially be  sharing a bathroom with them up here then. There is part of the cabin that I haven't shown you guys yet. Really? The master not having  an immediate bathroom off of that bedroom  was not a preference. But when it comes to having  additional guests in the house, there's a real happy  surprise for them. Wow.  BRETT: That's what  I'm talking about. ♪♪ NARRATOR:  Brett and Amy are searching  for their dream log cabin near the San Juan Mountains  in Colorado. The Hillside Cabin  is well within their budget. AMY:  Wow, this is a nice space. However, there is some  concern about the bedrooms. There is part of the cabin that I haven't shown you guys yet. Really?  Let's go see it. AMY: Wow, Justin,  what is this space? Well, you could set this up as a game room or a family room. There's a lot of room  down here. It has such a great  wood accent wall and the tile floor. And then there's a whole other bedroom and bathroom down there. There's so much room. It offers us  a lot of options. Now that you've seen  the entire cabin, tell me what  your thoughts are. I'm very happy there's no carpet in the house. It does have a big open kitchen area. I think the only thing I don't like about that is the tile countertop. It has that four-car garage,  which -- That would be fantastic. And, of course, we were looking for at least three bedrooms. And this delivers five. So I can't complain  about that. Well, I think the Hillside Cabin has a lot to offer us. Yeah. It's definitely  on our list. ♪♪ NARRATOR:  Southwestern Colorado provides  plenty of opportunities to get outside and enjoy nature. Today, Brett and Amy are taking  the girls out to Vallecito Lake to play  with their dog, Jace. AMY: We just love spending time  together as a family, especially in the outdoors,  in this area. BRETT: Good boy, Jace.  Bring it. Thirty minutes away  from Vallecito Lake, Justin will take Brett and Amy  to the Ponderosa Cabin, with nearby access to hiking in the San Juan National Forest. AMY: Wow.  BRETT: Four-car garage. Four-car garage. You could fill that up,  I think. Yeah, quickly. JUSTIN: The Ponderosa Cabin  is 3,228 square feet. It's just under five acres. It's got three bedrooms,  three baths in the main house. And then in the four-car garage, there's a separate  three-quarter bath also. Yeah, that's what  I'm talking about. AMY: When I see the garage,  all I can think is that Brett will never  come in the house. It's true.  I will lose him  in that garage. Well, the Ponderosa Cabin  is listed at $459,000. $459,000 is a little  over our budget.  Yeah. Well, keep in mind that is the seller's  asking price. So maybe try to negotiate  a little bit, meet in the middle somewhere. That would be great.  That's true. We would have to keep that  in mind, for sure. Ladies first.  Great, thanks. Wow, look at this entryway. BRETT: Yeah, this is nice. There's a lot of windows. And it brings in a lot of sunlight. It's very open and inviting. Not super excited about white  carpet, living in the woods. Look at how open this kitchen is, though. I know, I need to  go see that kitchen. That looks fantastic. Wow. I love  the double islands. It's so open. AMY: The kitchen  is just wonderful with all the cabinet space  and countertops. JUSTIN: Are you  a wine drinker? You got the built-in  wine rack right there. I could fill  the wine rack up. That is for sure.  Nice. I really like the color of the countertops, but it is tile. I wish it was solid. I knew you'd say that. Well, there are two guest rooms  right around the corner here. Oh, wow. This looks like  it'd be a great room for one of the kids. I immediately think that  Emily would enjoy this space. She could have enough room  for her furniture and then a lot of room  to play, as well. Let's go see what else the cabin has to offer. Okay. It's another big bedroom.  Yeah, this is a good size. There's a lot  of mirrors though. Yeah. I don't know about  all the mirrors. Yeah, that's a --  it's a little dated. Looks like there's  a door frame. That's probably another walk-in closet or something. Oh, wow. Wow.  Look at this. A bathroom attached? We immediately thought that our 15-year-old daughter would really like having an attached bathroom to her bedroom. And that would mean that Emily could have the other bathroom  all to herself. Yeah, that would be great. And there would be  no more fighting. Let's go see what else Justin has to offer. Okay. What are your initial reactions so far? Well, it's really  big and open. And I do really like that. How about  the master bedroom? It's right down here on the other wing of the house. Wow, what a great master. So big and open. BRETT: This is nice. I love the vaulted ceilings  and the -- those windows  are fantastic. Let's take a look  at that bathroom. Nice double vanities. AMY: Yeah, that is nice. We haven't had a double  vanity in quite a while. Yeah, still got the gold and silver fixtures. And the tile countertops  are definitely not my favorite. The house is already  a little over our budget. And so having to replace  anything at this point would be a little bit  of a concern. But it looks like there's  a separate tub and shower. Yeah, there is.  That's really nice. Yeah and that is  a big soaking tub. I was hoping for a little  space for visitors when they come to town. But otherwise, I think  this is a great place. Well, let's go  right around the corner. I got a surprise for you. AMY: Wow, what is this? Is this a fourth bedroom? You know, it's not really  advertised as a fourth bedroom because it doesn't  have the closet. It would work  as a guest room. AMY: When my family  from Florida comes to visit, they don't need  a whole closet. They have their suitcases  to live in. ♪♪ So what did you guys think  of the Ponderosa Cabin? All of the bedrooms  were a wonderful size. Got a great garage. I can still see a lot of houses from where this is at. It doesn't have that  log cabin feel inside. It does have  the white carpet. With the budget where it is, that would be hard  to replace things like that. But it would be something  we would have to keep in mind. Overall, I think  the Ponderosa cabin has a lot to offer us  and is a good option. ♪♪ NARRATOR:  Justin is showing Brett  and Amy the Creek Cabin, which offers fishing access  to Vallecito Creek right on the property. AMY: Well, Justin, that was quite a drive. JUSTIN: It was a little  further from town, but this is the Creek Cabin. And you'll see why  in just a second. JUSTIN: The Creek Cabin  is four bedrooms, three bathrooms, sits on about half an acre. It is 2,542 square feet. And the seller  is asking $450,000. That's in our budget. Although the Creek Cabin  is a little bit further out of town than Brett  and Amy might like, it does put them  right here on Vallecito Creek. Is that the creek that I hear?  It is. It's right off  the back porch over there. Wow.  I like that. That's interesting.  I never would've thought we'd have a creek  running next to a property we could afford.  No. The Creek Cabin  is beautiful. And the location is amazing. Even before we go inside, I -- I can't imagine  anything prettier. Oh, wow. Look at this room. ♪♪ NARRATOR:  Brett and Amy are searching  for a rustic log cabin just outside their hometown  of Bayfield, Colorado. The Ponderosa Cabin meets all of their wish-list  requirements. But could the Creek Cabin  become the new front-runner? Oh, wow. Look at this room. As we walk into the cabin, I notice the beautiful vaulted  tongue-in-groove ceilings and the openness  of the great room. This is beautiful. And look at that creek  out there. BRETT:  The creek view is fantastic. I really like that rock  behind the stove pipe there. Yeah, that really is pretty.  And I like that stove. It's not a standard black square box  like all the rest of them. It's not. I'm just wondering,  is it pretty, or is it efficient? Well, I'd imagine  it's pretty efficient. It would have to heat  this whole room. Well, Amy, I'm sure you'd love to view the kitchen. I would. Oh, wow. You can see  the peaks out there. I could definitely see  myself standing here and washing dishes,  as silly as that sounds. As far as the rest  of the kitchen, it's not as modern  and updated as I would like. The cabinets  aren't really my color. And the countertops  could use some updating. But they're a solid surface. There's no grout. I like all the --  all those windows in the dining area. That's really nice. It gives it a great view  from there. BRETT: I could really just  picture our family having dinner there  in the evenings in the summertime with the windows open listening to that creek  rolling by. Oh, this looks  like a nice room. Yeah, I could see  one of the girls turning this into a great room. This is the other bedroom. They're using it  as a sitting room. But clearly, a bedroom. I think the room's are really similar in size. So I don't think the girls would fight over who got what room. AMY: Next, we go upstairs  to see the master bedroom. And right outside,  there is this great loft space. This is a nice loft area. Yeah, I like the windows in here. It gives it a lot  of natural light. Oh, here's the master. There's a nice skylight  right over the bed. Is that carpet  in the bathroom? Oh, good. So there's tile around  the toilet and shower. Carpet by the sink  isn't too bad. Yeah, that countertop and that fixture's kind of dated though. But overall, I really like  the master suite. Yeah. The Creek Cabin  is beautiful. But I kind of feel like  we've seen all of the cabin, but I know there should  be another bedroom. Hey, Justin?  Where's that fourth bedroom? Follow me out  to the front porch. It seems a little strange.  So we follow him anyway. And then he points out  the bunkhouse. Which when we first arrived at the cabin, I thought was just  part of the garage. Oh, wow. AMY: As we go into  the bunkhouse, I'm surprised to see  what looks like a bedroom. There's a lot of room  in there. And it even has  its own bathroom. I think that would be a great  private place for my family when they come to visit. BRETT: The carpet would have to go. But this could  really work for us. This is the garage. The garage is about the same size that we have now. I was hoping for a little bit more. But we're also making what we have now work. So I know this can work,  as well. [ Birds chirping ] The Creek Cabin is beautiful. That great room  is nice and open. Yeah, it's got that rustic cabin  feel we were looking for. I do like that bunkhouse. We are 20 miles  from the kids' schools. And that would be  pretty inconvenient with all their activities. And then it's even farther  from where we work. So that's something  we'll definitely have to take into consideration. NARRATOR:  After seeing numerous cabins throughout  Southwestern Colorado, Brett and Amy head  to the mountains to discuss which cabin they will make their home. Man, it really is  beautiful out here. This is probably one of my favorite places. Yeah, me, too.  I love coming up here. We've narrowed it down  to the Hillside Cabin, the Creek Cabin,  and the Ponderosa Cabin. Yeah. And they're all  really great. So the Hillside Cabin. It had that  great bonus basement. I like all that room  in the garage to put all of our stuff. It was under budget. And it had five bedrooms. That one didn't really  have a master suite. It also had homes  right next to it, where you were  overlooking them. What do you like about  the Ponderosa Cabin? The Ponderosa Cabin had the most acreage. It had a lot of space for us to spread out outside. It does have  that huge garage. And it has that open kitchen. It had that white carpet. That would be  awfully muddy. I'm just not sure  about that. I was really hoping we wouldn't have our neighbors that close. Then there's  that Creek Cabin. That is like a dream cabin with the creek right there  and the mountain views. That was beautiful. The kitchen and great room  area was nice and open. But I really felt like it  was a little cramped. The master suite at the top floor was great, but that was a long ways from town. That was a really  long way from town. Even though  it's a dream cabin with that creek running  in the background, I think that drive to town makes us have  to eliminate the Creek Cabin. I would agree.  I think after 18 years of marriage,  you know me. And that's just a lot of time to be spent on the road. So that leaves us  with the Hillside Cabin and the Ponderosa Cabin. This is a really hard decision. I don't know how we're  going to choose. ♪♪ NARRATOR:  Brett and Amy are searching  for a rustic log cabin just outside their hometown  of Bayfield, Colorado. They've eliminated  the Creek Cabin and are now weighing out which cabin is the one for them. So that leaves us  with the Hillside Cabin and the Ponderosa Cabin. One thing I liked about that Ponderosa Cabin is that four-car  garage was huge. They both had  a pretty open kitchen. Ponderosa Cabin, though,  was just much bigger. And I think that we could  have great family gatherings and have friends over. The Ponderosa Cabin  was over our budget. And the Hillside Cabin was  pretty well under our budget. I think that comes  from the acreage. It's one acre at  the Hillside Cabin versus five acres  at the Ponderosa. Yeah, and, you know, asking  price is just a starting point. And I could see five acres, having plenty of room for the dogs to run. Maybe put up a zip-line.  Yeah. And you and Emily could have  your archery range, too. That's true. Yeah, I-I think we know. I think we do, too.  It's the Ponderosa Cabin. That's the garage  I wanted anyway. ♪♪ Let's go tell the girls. They'll be so excited. ♪♪ Thanks for making this  the first project you did at the new cabin,  Daddy. Before we were all  unpacked and decorated, there was nothing  I could do to stop Brett from putting up a zip-line  to surprise the girls. Whee! Whoo-hoo! BRETT: This is the perfect cabin for us, because of the acreage,  the garage, and the space in the house. That was awesome, huh?  Yeah. It's pretty cool  living out here, huh?  Yes. The Ponderosa Cabin  was listed at $459,000. We offered $423,000. The final purchase price  of the Ponderosa Cabin was $423,000. That's $27,000  under our budget. Glad we have a place  to put your grandpa's elk. When did he harvest it? Uh, 1949. We've had our friends  and family over a few times. I'm so excited about our future  at the Ponderosa Cabin. I can't wait until  several years from now, when the girls bring their families home with the grandkids and we can all enjoy  that great, big space.
