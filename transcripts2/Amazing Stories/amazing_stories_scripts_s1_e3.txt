 [grunting, panting] [car door closes] What the hell is he wearing? He's Batman. It's Halloween this weekend, Dad. Looking good, buddy. Isn't he a little old for that? Please. You know, Dad, you can view this as an opportunity. You know, be with us, not have to work. Spend some time with your grandkids, your family. We'll just take care of you. I don't need taking care of, Michael. Dad, come on. It doesn't have to be a bad thing. This could, uh, be a new beginning. You know, I got all the exercise equipment that the trainer recommended.

 And she'll be here to start rehab tomorrow. - It's like I tell my patients... - You're a gastroenterologist. I still have to tell them stuff. [door opens] Okay. We've got Dylan's room all set up for you. [exhales] Where's the kid gonna sleep? Oh, upstairs with Bryce. And we're just down the hall if you need us for any reason at all during the night. I think I can handle being unconscious for six hours. Be the best six hours of my day. You know, Joe, uh... You know, if at any point you wanna talk about how you're feeling, I'm around. In my practice, I, um, I've counseled a lot of patients going through similar transitions with aging and... and the grief that goes with that. I don't feel any grief. Oh, no, no. Yeah. Uh, I'm just saying that it's natural, you know, if there's some sense of loss... - [door opens] - And I'm not feeling any loss. Well, I am here if you wanna talk. [croaking] [Joe sighs] Mmm. [Joe] Hmm. You're into comics, huh? [chuckles] Uh... You're... You feeling any better? Since an hour ago? No. Uh... You, uh, can read any of my comics if you'd like. Uh... oh... I... I made these. - [cane thumping] - [grunts] You made Batman? Well, no. I'm trying to make my own. I wanna be like the next Neal Adams. Uh, the... the guy who made B-Batman. [sighs] - I, uh, need to be alone, kid. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure, uh... If you need anything, just, uh, let me know. I will have to come in and feed him every once in a while, but yeah. - [knee brace clicks] - [sighs] [sighs] Oh! Uh... Sorry, uh... - [Bryce] Jesus, Dyl. Why don't you knock? - Sorry. - [radio: soft music] - Do you need something? Why is Grandpa such a jerk? I don't know. He's old. Can we talk about this, like, any other time? Oh, uh, yeah. Sorry. What are you doing? Uh, Mom said I'm sleeping here. [crickets chirping] - [sighs] - [footsteps approaching] - [Michael] Why aren't you in Bryce's room? - Uh, I like this better. [Michael sighs] - Listen, I know. Grandpa can be a bit... - Mean. - Well... - Dad, he's just mean. Well... Look, he's had a different life. His dad died young. He had to be tough. So, um, I don't know. Maybe we can cut him a little slack. - Okay? - Okay. All right. Don't stay up too late, pal. Okay? [switches clicking] - Good night. - Good night. Love you. [pencil scratching] [woman] All right. Let's see where you are. So, let me see if you can lift the foot. [metal scraping] - [grunts] - [clunking] - Oh, all right. It's... - [Joe groans] Okay. It's okay. [mom] I have patients too. Important ones. [Michael] I'm not suggesting that yours aren't important, just that mine aren't less important. My 3:00 has a colon that's completely wrapped around itself. So gross, Dad. Sorry, Bryce, but this is what I do for a living. You know, people's colons paid for your car. Hey, can you drive Dylan home from school? - Can he wait till I'm done with practice? - That's like 6:30. - Dylan, be flexible. - Stop. I'll get him. What else am I doing around here? Let me have the keys. Well, uh, Dad, I don't think you can drive. I can drive, Michael. It's my left leg. [kids chattering, laughing] Oh! Hey, Brady. Did you get my texts? Uh, so, you wanna start at your house or mine, or... Actually, Dylan, I was thinking. This year I might have something I need to do. What are you talking about? We always spend Halloween together. Since, like, preschool. No, I... I know. But this year I was thinking of going to the dance. A dance? On Halloween? What are you talking about? - It's just that... - Hey, Brady. Hey. Uh, one sec. Okay. [sighs] I'm sorry, Dylan. Just not this year, but... I'll catch up with you. Hey, Maya, wait up. Uh, yeah, c-catch you later. - [grinding] - [hammering] Ah! Boys, I'm back. - Hey, Joe! - How's it going? Hey, how you do... Frank, watch your fingers. You're gonna lose one. - Hey, Joe. - Kenny. I was gonna come check on you. Why you dragging yourself in here? I got a check in the office. You don't think I'm gonna let you son of a bitches grab it, do ya? - [men laughing] - Seriously, Joe. Do you need a hand or something? I don't need a hand, Kenny. I don't need a hand. - Lance. - Joe. Don't worry. Doc says I'll be back in six weeks. Don't even think about hiring a replacement. Slow down a second, Joe. You've been out of surgery, what, three days? Four days. But I'm getting better. I'm gonna be better than better. Look, I was, uh, I was gonna put this in the mail. But, uh, seeing as how you're here... It's your union contract. What's that got to do with anything? Well, your pension plan is in there. You've been with us for 45 years, Joe. You're fully vested. I mean, even, you know, with social security... [chuckles] You were practically working for nothing, yeah. You know? What are you talking about, Lance? You want me to retire? Got some A-plus benefits in here, Joe. I'm not gonna retire. I belong here. This is my shop. I've been here longer than you. - I'm the best guy in the place. - I'm not denying that you were. What do you mean "were"? I am. I am getting better every day. Look, we got a lot of big contracts coming in right now. We got restaurants, hotels, and these are some hard deadlines I gotta meet. I can't put a man out there who can't do the work. We'll see. You know, look. Come on. Save yourself the heartache, Joe. We all know it's time to... [sighs] Look, this happens to other people. - I've seen it. - I'm not other people. I will be back. No, you won't. Look, I'm saying this as a friend. Okay, Joe? You're either gonna take this retirement plan right now or you're gonna take it in six weeks, but we both know you're taking it. - [car approaches] - [brakes squeak] I thought you forgot. No, I had to deal with something at the shop. [sighs] [Dylan] Hmm. So, how was your day? Great. Great. Buckle up. I hate junior high. It sucks. You hate junior high? I'd give anything to be back in school. - I was captain of the football team... - Oh, so you were popular. Well, popular? That's an understatement. I was a legend. - Really? - Yeah. Night of the senior prom, I got the football team to put the principal's car on the roof. - The roof? - Yes! - What? - Well, not all at once. You gotta disassemble it and... Doesn't matter how you got it up there. At the end of the dance, everybody came out, and there we were on the roof. Football team, Principal Moon's car and me. Legendary. They talk about it at every reunion. So, to become popular, I gotta become captain of the football team and put a car on a roof. Got it. [sighs] So, what's the story? You don't have any friends? I sorta have one. Brady. But recently, I don't think he wants to be around me anymore. Well, to hell with him then. Buckle up, please. [sighs] [grunts] Oh... Hey, this is for you, Grandpa. [grunts] Probably some exercise equipment from your father. He goes overboard with that kinda stuff. It says it's from Wham Comics. What'd you say? What is it? - Well, let's find out. - [keys jingling] [paper tearing] "Dynoman." I ordered this when I was a kid. I don't understand. Maybe it got lost in the mail. For 60 years? I ordered this from the back of a comic book, and it never came. I bugged my mother for months to get my 50 cents back. Wait. You were into comics too? Long time ago. This is nuts. It must be a joke. Probably Kenny at the shop is behind this. Yeah. What did you do with the comics? I, uh, guess I probably gave 'em to your dad. He never throws anything away. [Dylan] What's the story of Dynoman? He was, uh, a miner like my dad. I think that's probably why I liked him. He was working underground one day, and a stick of dynamite blew up and shot three radioactive rocks into his ring. Each one had a special power. Strength, speed and flight. Hmm. So, like, how do the powers work? What do you mean? Like, are they alien rocks that change his metabolism? Or is it magic? Why do you need an explanation for everything? Your generation needs an explanation for everything. What the hell's the matter with you guys? Sorry. So, who's that? That's the Volt, Dynoman's archenemy. Dynoman saved Volt's village in Romania from a meteor. He smashed it with his ring. But a chunk of debris destroyed a house, killing a man and woman inside while their son played outside. The boy vowed vengeance on Dynoman. He found all the remnants of the meteor, which had absorbed the power of Dynoman's ring and began to glow. The Volt saw that glow and knew he could have that power too. From those remains, he built his helmet. So, the hero made the villain. Pretty standard stuff. You're right. Coulda used a twist. My stories had more panache. Wait. What do you mean, "your stories"? Yeah. I wrote a few stories in my day. Really? That's what I do. So... So why'd you stop? [inhales] Can't play with superheroes forever, kid. [Joe grunting] - Wait, Grandpa. - Okay... It says it comes when you need it, right? And this came now. Because you need it. You gotta try it. You try it. Put it on. See if it fits. No, it's too big. Y... You gotta try it. I think it's for you. Come on, for me. - Let me have it. - [cane bangs] Holy moly. It fits. Yeah. - What is it? - Nothing. See? It's a piece of junk. It's a toy. What? Wait, wait. Grandpa, Grandpa. All I'm saying is, toys don't just magically appear after 60 years. Try. Hit the bag. Are you kidding? You don't actually believe in magic, do ya? I saw it glow. Isn't that how it works? Yes. But I got it from a comic book. This is a chunk of plastic. And we're gonna do with it what we should've done a long time ago. We're gonna throw it in the garbage can. Son of a bitch, I can't get it off. - Hey, Grandpa. Please, stop. I... Come on. - I think my beta-blockers... - Please. - Stop it. Quit. Stop it! Please stop. I know things are crappy right now, but believing in something stupid is not the answer. It's not stupid. Son of a... Goddamn it. Oh... [sighs] Hey. Where are you going? Dylan? Get cleaned up. It's almost dinner. Hi. Uh... That doesn't look like Indian food. [sighs] Yeah, called an audible. Figured we'd try something new. "New" as in "let's give our family a new species of tapeworm"? They're burgers. They're fine. Burgers that were just the subject of an exposé in the Times for putting God knows what in their meat. Not meat. They're his favorite, okay? Ah. So that's what this is. Please, don't analyze me right now. Oh, I hate what he does to you. What is he... He's not doing anything to me. He doesn't even know about dinner. You're always trying to impress him. You walk on eggshells so that he doesn't criticize you, but he always does anyway. And then you feel bad. Like right now. You didn't get Indian food because you were worried your dad would go on some rant about how we think we're too good for regular old American food. I'm just protective of you. We're doing a lot for your dad, and he doesn't even seem to be grateful. You watch. This gesture will go a long way. Yeah? He might... He might even say thank you. I would eat those burgers every night for a month if your father ever says thank you. - Where's Dylan? - He wanted to eat in the living room. Bryce, can you stop with the ball? We're eating now, please. Coach said I have to keep my hands on it at all times. I'm pretty sure he meant figuratively. Wow. Nice bling, Grandpa. Ah. This is nothing. Oh, hey, Dad, before I forget, guess who called me today. - Who? - Lance. [chuckles] They were talking about how much they appreciate the work you've done over the years for them. And apparently, to honor that, they've offered you a pretty generous retirement package? Fine. I'll take it in 20 years. [chuckles] Well, okay. I think you might wanna think about it a little sooner. What are you saying? Nothing. I'm just, you know, you've put your time in there for, what, 45 years? Paid your dues. You don't think I can get back, do you? No, I'm not saying that. Wow. What a payoff for a father who believed in you. Okay. Did you? Didn't you call medical school a boot camp for know-it-alls? It is. That's where you two met, isn't it? Hey, Dylan. Why don't you come in here and sit with us for a little bit? Joe, Mike's just looking out for you. And he trusts Lance. Lance has been running point on the ins and outs of all the new jobs that are coming in. If he's worried about you being there, we're not just gonna let you go back to work, because y-you... Let me? Yeah. Frankly, at your age... My age? You are not far behind me. Don't forget that. Dad. Stop. Take a breath. We're just trying to get you to... To think realistically about your future. I'm the reason we get those big orders. I am the one responsible for all those contracts. - I'm the reason... - Grandpa, look. We ship all that furniture out of the state. And now Lance is. - I built it with my own hands. - Grandpa, the ring. I have been building it all my life. - Maybe that life is over. - Bryce, the ball. My life is not over! There has got to be an explanation. Yeah, that it's real. You saw it glowing. Kid, this rock's as dull as your dad's sense of humor. Yeah, now. But before? Don't you feel different? Strong? Anything? Come on, just try. Smash it. Nah. Come on. You said it yourself. Dynoman's powers only came to him whenever he needed them. And you clearly needed it because you were pissed off at Mom and Dad. - It was your anger. - Nah, it'd be insane. Is it? Or are you just too afraid to see if you're strong? I guess he is smarter than you, 'cause you barely made it out of high school, and he made it all the way to medical school. You're basically uneducated... Son of a bitch. I was right. You're right. You're a superhero, Grandpa. Oh, my... You really are! Hot damn! Mother of God. And the knee? Cool. [whooping] [Lance] Remember, guys. This is black walnut. You bend your knees, you watch your backs, okay? Kenny, this needs to go out by Tuesday. [Kenny] Copy. Joe. Hey, listen. I'm glad your family talked some sense into you. Wait. No, no. You can't do that, Joe. - You need a full doctor's... - What are you doing? That's a liability. Shall I, uh, clock in, Lance? [man] What the... [kids chattering] Hey, Brady. Brady. I found something so cool. You're never gonna believe this. Can we... talk about this later? Uh, okay. Is that him? It's me? - [Brady] I... - What? - [whispering] I can explain. - [boy] Hey, Batman. My dad's being a real bitch about my curfew. Could you and Robin go kick his ass for me? [kids laughing] Oh, Jesse. Be nice. He's just playing dress-up. Dress-up Dylan. It has a nice ring to it. Huh? Huh? [kids laughing] [Jesse] Hey, where are you going? We can have a party. A costume party. You can be Wonder Woman. Dylan, hey. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Me and some other people, we were just hanging out the other day, and I took a group selfie. And I was about to post it when, uh, they saw my photo stream and the photo you sent to me. Of me in the costume. Yeah. I... I told them you were an old friend who likes to... To dress up. - They thought it was funny. - No kidding! - Dylan, I... - Why didn't you stop them? Why didn't you say, like, how last year you dressed up as Venom and thought it was cool? You were laughing at me. - Dude. - Just go. [whispering] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - [sighs] - [bell rings] [sighs] - [Michael] Concept. Yeah, yeah. - Hola. Hey, Dad. By the way, did something happen with your physical therapist in the garage? The work bench is all shattered. [speakers: mellow jazz] Yes. She put some weights on it. It collapsed. Shoddy construction. Let me tell you about that. Really? How you feeling today? Actually, fantastic. Fantastic. That's... That's a big leap from yesterday. Good. I've just come from the doctor's. He gave me a complete release. What? Maybe you'll, uh, think twice about doubting me again. I go back to work tomorrow. What? But that... that's not possible. And yet it is. And what's better, I will be out of your hair in... six days, never mind six weeks. Where's Dylan? Uh, in... in his room. In your room. [stammers] Over there. Dylan, man, you should've been there. I'm sorry you didn't see it. What's going on with you? You... Why you got such a long face? I'm toxic. "Toxic"? Look. Who is this? Just look. Ah. They're calling you Dress-up Dylan. I see that. Okay. Dylan, if I could get this ring off, I would give it to you. You could kick the crap out of that guy. But I can't get it off. But if there's anything else I could do to help you, I would. Actually... maybe there is. What? Let's put the principal's car on the roof. You can get it up there. Easy. And I'll stand by it, take credit for it. Look. When I was a kid, we did not put the car on the roof. We lifted it up and took it down the block a little bit. The principal was surprised. I... I exaggerated, honestly. We could do it now. I'll be, like, a total legend. No one will know how I did it. I don't think you really need to worry about those kids in school. They're losers. They're gonna grow up to be losers, too. You wanna go trick-or-treating, you go trick-or-treating. You know, go on out there. Get yourself some candy. It's not really the same. No, I guess it isn't. All right, look. I know when I get down, I don't wanna have anybody near me, so I'm gonna leave you alone. Wait. You're right. I am? Yeah. I don't need Brady, or any of them. - No. - I could go have the best Halloween ever. Yes, that's the spirit. With you. Let's go trick-or-treating. It'll be awesome. It'll be so much fun. You get off at work at 5:00. Right? All right. Five o'clock. Trick-or-treating. You and me. Don't be late. ["Carry On Wayward Son" plays] [train whistle blows] [radio: "Carry On Wayward Son" playing] [buzzing] Jeez, Joe. I guess I should've asked you for help. Damn right. [radio: song continues] I'm taking an early lunch, Lance. [song continues] [song continues] - [song fades] - [approaching wind] Good-lookin' map you got there, kiddo. What are you doing here? I just took a little lunch break. Thought I'd come say hello. [kids laughing, chattering] - Guess how I got here. - How? [whispers] I ran. No way! - Yep. - Speed, the second stone? - Damn right. - Okay. So, Fox Point and Shorewood have the best candy. Yeah. The East Side and Whitefish Bay are second. Yeah. Usually, me and Brady have time for one, maybe two. But with your speed... - We'll get all four tonight. - [chuckles] Bring a big bag. We're gonna keep your dentist busy for years. Oh, yeah. - [whirring] - [hammering] Soon as I called, you said, "Sure, 150 tables. Those will be done." - Yes. - But now you don't have my 150 tables. [Kenny] Hey, Joe. - How we doing, Kenny? - Doing okay. What's Lance all in a tizzy about over there? Customer's pissed. She's got a restaurant opening in two days, and we were supposed to have all their tables ready by tomorrow. It's gonna be another week. Well, always happens. You oughta be more straight with the customer. Oh, he's just trying to keep her business. She's the regional manager. It's a big chain. [woman] So now I expect them tomorrow. I... I understand, yes. I'm very sorry. - We just need, uh... We need... - Till tomorrow. Your tables and chairs will be ready tomorrow, guaranteed. And we'll throw in a handmade sign. Free. - Handmade sign. - Yep. You better. - Hmm. [chuckles] - Joe, what are you doing? Don't worry about a thing, Lance. I got this covered. Okay. You... You got this covered. Okay. ["Down On The Street" plays] [song continues] [mumbling] [laughs] [song continues] - [song ends] - [kids laughing, chattering] [clattering] Please don't say, "I told you so." I don't have to say anything. The look on our son's face says it all. Nothing you can say about your dad right now makes that look okay. [sighs] You're right. Not here yet, huh? [both sigh] What's going on with you and Grandpa? N-Nothing. What? It just seems like both of you have been acting a little different lately. Mmm. Y-You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. Do you know where he is right now? Dylan? Come on, honey. You can tell me. Probably having fun with his superpowers. His... His what? Do you know Dynoman? You mean, like, the comic? Yeah. Grandpa used to try to get me into that when I was... when I was a kid. Well, I like it. Um, but, uh... - But... - Dylan, trust me. Whatever it is, I-I've been in the same boat with Grandpa Joe. So, okay. There's this ring... [men laughing] - Hey, did you see the look on his face? - Wow. I think you're gonna send him to an early retirement. - Okay. - Be a good idea. We'll get a guy in here with managerial experience. - [Kenny laughs] - I was gonna tell you guys. You're all getting a big fat "you're fired" is what's happening. - [men groaning, laughing] - Yeah. Dad, what the hell are you doing? [Kenny] Uh, hey, fellas. Maybe, uh, let's grab another round at the bar. - [murmuring] - [bottles sloshing] - You've gotta be kidding me right now. - Mike, I'm sorry. And not only did you stand him up, he thinks you're a superhero? He's not just a boy looking up to his grandpa. He thinks you're an actual superhero with powers. - I will go home and explain things. - No, you're not. [scoffs] Trust me. You can explain things to me, like why you're filling his head with this Dynoman crap anyway. Dynoman. It's my favorite comic book. - Don't you remember? - I know what it is, Dad. - I tried to give it to you... - Yeah. Like I tried to give you all the things I love, all the stuff I loved. Dad, you think I wanted stuff? I wanted you. And that's what Dylan wants. And you're screwing that up with him the way you screwed it up with me. He's learning what I learned a long time ago this very moment: that all you ever really care about is you, - your shop, your interests, your friends. - Me? This is my work. I love this place. And not only that, but I worked today. - I made all those tables. - Stop. You see those tables? We made them today. - We were backed up. I lost track of time. - Just stop. Dad. Just stop, Dad. It was always something. An order came in. Another shift came up. Anything so you wouldn't have to have dinner with us. I worked for you. I worked for your mother and you. No. You tell yourself that so you can sleep at night. But it was always about you. For whatever reason, whatever you needed, you couldn't get from me, or Mom. You know what the thing is, I actually thought this time was gonna be different. I thought maybe, finally you could change. I actually thought the injury could be a good thing. But you know what the interesting thing is? The minute that your job was threatened, suddenly your knee fixes itself. That's very convenient, Dad. Where is Dylan now? Dylan's in his room crying his eyes out that the one guy who he thought was on his team isn't. The one guy who said he wasn't a loser decides he'd rather show off for some friends at work that don't need him than keep his word to a grandson who does. I can fix this, Mike. No, this isn't patching up some dining room table. It's way too late to fix. You know, you've been wanting to leave our house from the minute you got there. Well, now you're gonna get your wish. I want you to go home, get your stuff and leave. [sighs, grunts] [grunts] Ow. [Dylan] Who's that? [Joe] That's the Volt, Dynoman's archenemy. Dynoman saved Volt's village in Romania from a meteor. He smashed it with his ring... which had absorbed the power of Dynoman's ring and began to glow. The Volt saw that glow and knew he could have that power too. From those remains, he built his helmet. [clicking] Happy Halloween. - [girl] Thanks so much. - [boy] Thank you. Yeah, happy Halloween. [kids chattering, shouting] - What happened? - What do you think happened? Nothing. He doesn't get it. And I'm done trying to make him care about his family. If he wants to push everyone away and end up alone, that's his problem. I'm sorry. I just... I'm gonna go tell Dylan he can have his room back. I'll be very surprised if Dad even comes home tonight. [vehicle approaches] I wouldn't be so sure. Dylan! Dylan! - [Bryce] Damn it, Dylan! - Where is he? Hi, Mr. Harris. Oh. Sorry, Grandpa. Your brother, where is he? I don't know. I think there's a dance tonight. We saw him leave in his costume. He said tonight was gonna be legendary. Whatever that means. "Legendary." Oh, no. Hey, Grandpa. Close the door. [kids chattering, laughing] [man] Let's go, guys. - You look great. - [boys laughing] [creaking] Dad, we need to talk. [tires squealing] [kids chattering] Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay. Okay. [grunts] - [thudding] - [grunts] [rope creaking] No, no, no. [SUV creaking] [panting] - No, no. - [creaking continues] [grunts] Oh, no. Oh, no. [door handle thumping] Come on. Crap! [creaking continues] Oh! Holy moly! Kid! Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh... Oh, God. I'm coming, kid. - Dylan! - Grandpa! Grandpa! Help! - [grunts] Oh, Dylan. No. - Grandpa. Push the car up. No, no. I... I got no more powers. - What? - I have no powers left. Okay. Just stay forward. - Stay forward. Okay. - Okay. Grab hold of the wheel. Come toward me, real easy. Don't make any sudden move... No, no, no. Wait. Let me grab my... Grab my hand. [Joe] Oh! Oh! - [Dylan] No! No! - Oh! - I'm so sorry, Dylan! - No, Grandpa! [Dylan] No, no! - [Dylan screams] - [Joe shouts] [creaking] - Mike. - Dad! I got ya. Hold on. Mike. How you doing that? What? [Dylan] It's incredible. [chuckles] It is. [Michael] Ah... Dad, Dylan? - [Joe] Oh! - [Dylan] Dad. - [Joe] That was... - Slow, slow. It's okay. You're okay. - Holy mackerel, Mike. - [kisses] [Michael] You're okay. I got ya. That's scary, Mike. Wh... [exhales] Oh, my God. Did you... I just... And then I... - That was awesome! - That was awesome. I held a car, Dad. I held a car. - How'd you do it, Mike? - I don't know. It just happened. [stammers] I was in the garage. I was looking for you. You weren't there. I saw the ring on the ground, and then it... it just took over. [car alarm blares] They're gonna catch us. No. They're not.

It is! - [kids laughing] [dog barking in distance] So, that's it? We're just gonna bury it? Well, it's like Dynoman said, "It only comes when you need it," kiddo. [Michael] Hmm.
