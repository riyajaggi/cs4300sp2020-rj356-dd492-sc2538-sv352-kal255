 Bored to Death (2009–2011): Season 3, Episode 2 - Gumball! - full transcript 
 Ray rescues Jonathan from certain death. Jonathan, with a sketch of his face on the front page of a daily tabloid, is the suspect in the murder of a Jewish jockey. The police are closing in, but rather than flee the country, Jonathan decides to solve the crime and prove his innocence. He has only a cellphone number as a clue. George is high on marijuana and possibly paranoid. Can Jonathan find the woman in the yellow hat and get the truth? All roads lead to a carousel.

 Come on, Ray. Where are you? I'm coming, Jonathan. Hold the door. Hold the door. Hey, hey. hey! Oh, hi. I've always had this thing where I kind of want to just grab a policeman's gun. Kind of like a mental Tourette's that I don't act on' I think it's the way it kind of just protrudes. It's like' "Touch me. Touch me." And you can't, you know? Have you been drinking? No, sir. No.

 This is my ﬂoor. Thank you. Building inspector. Yes? It's been reported that you have a safety violation by your window. The co-op board is going to fine you. Wait, what? Reported? I'm gonna have to violate your inspection. It's a matter of code, so... - Wait. - Yeah. Todd, what's going on? There's some kind of window problem. He's from the co-op board. But it's after midnight. That's the most dangerous time of night for windows. I'll only be a second, okay? - Jonathan! - Ray! Thank God.

 Okay, just drop down to the ledge. - I'll catch you. - No, I'll die. Yeah, maybe. - Maybe? - But I won't let you. I've been carrying Spencer all day I'll catch you. I am a father now. Okay. - Ray! - I got you! I got you! I got you! Thank you. Thank you, Ray. Ray, thank you. Thank you so much, Ray. What the hell is going on? I'm calling the cops. No, that's not necessary. Your window's fine. I'll tell the co-op board, okay? Here's $11 for your trouble. Sorry. Ray, I'm not complaining, but what took so long? I almost died up there. Sorry, I was getting some action from Leah. You know what I'm up against. She has the sex drive of a cicada. I couldn't turn it down. I was hanging on that clock for an hour, and you just had sex? Yeah, it was great. I got her to soak her nipples in whiskey and nurse me. Come on, two of my most favorite things in the world. Hope I don't get a DUI. Well, drunk driving is the least of our problems right now. Okay, you're right. Start from the beginning. How did you get framed for murder? And then when I came to, my pants were at my ankles, and the gun was in my hand. Next thing I know, the cops are banging on the door, but I got away. Lord. Are you making this up? No. And I don't know why my pants were at my ankles. Have you tried to go to the bathroom? Are you sore? Ray, don't be mean. This is the worst night of my life. Mean? It's a legitimate question. If you were sexually assaulted while unconscious, I would like to know. 30"'! Listen, I just think you should go to the police and tell them everything you know. I can't do that. I could be in Rikers for months before my name is cleared. And I've got a lot of blog interviews to do for my book. Yeah, but if you were at Rikers, it could help sales. That's true. But I'm supposed to be on The New Dick Cavett Show next week. - I don't want to miss that. - No, no, forget Cavett. Turn yourself in. It's the most sane course of action. I can't. I have a natural tendency towards guilt. I might freak out and make a false confession. Also, you ﬂed the scene of a crime. Innocent men do not run. My God, you're right. I might go to prison. - Oh, God. - All right, all right. Listen, you two. Look, let's just go to bed. I read in a spy novel once the fugitive's most effective weapon is sleep. We'll figure this all out in the morning. Sleep? I'm too upset to sleep. I've just shattered my life. All right, Jonathan. I'll put on the vaporizer. I also have some Valium. It's a mixture that I've been playing around with lately. Could be comforting. Also, it's not too bad if you top it off with just a sip of prosecco. Sounds like a pot-head's BLT. I like it. Come here. Let me take care of you. Come on. My thoughts feel buttery. Hey, can we do high-lows? Leah and I do that when we tuck her girls in. Sure, Ray. You go first. Well, my high was breastfeeding Spencer and being nursed by Leah. And I didn't have a low. Your turn, George. My high was seeing Emily. My low was her boyfriend, who was wearing a bicycle leotard and asking permission to marry her. But that's wonderful news, George. It isn't. He's nearly 60. He's way too old for her. I might sleep with a woman half my age, but I'd never marry her. Well, from one father to another, I think that's a reasonable position to take. Your turn, Jonathan. Well, in the last 24 hours, I found out that I came from a sperm bank in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, and I've been framed for murder. You're supposed to say, "My high was..." I don't feel like playing a game right now' Ray. I'm in real trouble. The universe is punishing me for having my book out. No, you shouldn't think like that. The universe doesn't care about books. Okay, let's go to sleep. Everything will be all right in the morning. No spooning, Ray. No spooning, Ray. I can't fall asleep unless I hold someone. All right, Ray. Good night, boys. Good night, George. Good morning. Mr. Christopher, there are police here. They want to come up and see you. What'? Well, stall them. Offer them scones. The police are downstairs at the restaurant. They're coming up to talk to me. These guys are really good detectives. They must have googled me. I had a beautiful dream about a gumball machine. - Can I tell you about it'? - Not now, Ray. Ray, get out of bed! We've got to hide! Where are you going? Where are you going? No, no. They'll see you there. Here, get in the dumbwaiter. It goes down to the restaurant's kitchen. Go on, get in. The scones didn't work. Okay, it's best to act totally innocently. I got that from the same spy novel. Hey, fellas. Come on up. Fifth ﬂoor. I'll leave the door open. - Why am I fleeing? - 'Cause you're a good friend. It's too early to be a good friend. All right, I'll try to keep the police busy, and then I'll catch up with you two later. George, George. We need shoes for running and phones for communicating. Why didn't you... Hurry. Here's some spending money, too. We'll meet up later. Make sure you're not followed. They might tail you to get to me. - Really? - Come on. Oh, hey, fellas. Sorry. I hope I wasn't hanging out there. Come on in. George's shoes are really hard to make a getaway in. I think they're the Italian ones O.J. Simpson wore. Did you notice last night how hairless George's legs are? I did notice. Do you think it's because his pants have rubbed everything off over the last 60 years, or did his legs go bald because he's so old? I don't know. It is mystifying. I think... Oh, my God, Ray, look. That Arab terrorist has your mole. That's me, Ray. Here. Buy a copy. We've got to get off the streets I'm a wanted man. I would have never drawn you like that. What is our city coming to? - Thank you, sir. - There's killers everywhere. They made my nose way too big. This thing is a real Shylockian fish hook. Do you think it's anti-Semitic on purpose? I don't think so. I think the cops will probably spin it as a Jew-on-Jew murder to avoid a race riot. - Remember Crown Heights? - Yeah, you're right. I wonder what Spencer's nose will look like Right now it's just a little nub, with these two little breathing holes. Little guy. Yeah, my nose was nice and small. Then it exploded. Puberty hit me there at least two years before it hit my penis. I was all out of proportion. Can we have one conversation that doesn't involve your peen? It won't be easy, but I can try. I've gotta get the bastards who did this. It has to be my client. I never should have taken a case over the phone. - Do you know where he lives? - No, but I do have his cell phone number. We need someone who can get us an address off of that. Now I think... Shit, we've been made. How's staring camp going? What's the matter, you don't like my pajamas? I don't like your corporate slave outfit. - It's so good to see you, Howard. - Yeah, I've been expecting you. Get away from the window. I've been reading the papers. - Got everything prepared. - What? I only had two hours, but I think I've got you covered. All right, stolen Amex. This is good for 48 hours. Passport. And pilot's disguise. And I'm throwing in a free lock pick. I've always wanted to wear one of these. I like the shiny brim. I think my eyes are drawn to it. That's for Jonathan. Where's George? He never fools around on an operation. He's diverting the police at the moment. Jaime Montero? Why am I Mexican? You have Mexican pigmentation. You made him Mexican in this country? They'll be all over him. I made him a Mexican airline pilot. The two things cancel each other out. You know, I don't think I like your attitude. I don't think I like your attitude. - Oh, well, tell it to your beard. - Whoa, whoa. Guys. Howard, I appreciate all this, but I'm not leaving the US. I want to find the murderer and prove my innocence. All I have is his cell phone number. I need a name and an address. I'm gonna have to hack into the telecom. It's not gonna be easy. Not easy means not cheap. I assume George is paying for all of this? - Yeah. - All right, I'll run the number. Throw in another one of these pilot outfits. I could have a fat pilot outfit in 20 minutes. No, I need one. This isn't for you. I'm glad you're not running, Jonathan. I was convicted of exposing myself on the D train. I've never been able to clear my name. These people with cell phone cameras. You have the chance I never got. George, perfect timing. I was just coming to see you. All right. Just try to keep a low profile. What? Why? There might be people following me. No, don't be so obvious. You know, I'm not one to judge, George, but you reek of cannabis. I just had one medicinal hit. My nerves are shot. Try to be a little judicious about this kind of thing with Emily. She's still new to sobriety. She's not entirely stable. I know, I know. I... Trust me, I have every intention of hiding my smoking from her. And I don't usually indulge in the morning. It's just that I've been dealing with the police. Why? What's happening? Are you selling marijuana? No. A friend of mine is in trouble. It's a bit complicated. - It's best you stay out of it. - Okay. But listen, I came to see if you had an answer. Do I have your permission to marry Emily? Bernard. I'm gonna borrow your bicycle. Wait. George. - Yes or no? - Can I get an extension? Not even wearing a helmet. The house over there. Was the bag really necessary? What? It makes my outfit more authentic. Plus I need a good overnight bag. Shit, it's my parents. Jonathan? Mom, now is not a good time. I got a... Two homicide detectives are here. They said you're wanted for murder of a nice jockey. A Jewish jockey. What were you thinking? Did you murder him because I'm sterile? - Tell your parents I said hi. - Listen, I'm innocent. I swear. Tell the detectives I'm gonna clear my name. He says he's innocent. He went to Princeton. He wouldn't lie. Yeah, the tuition there was very expensive. I can't believe my parents got dragged into this. They're hysterical. I'm gonna make this guy pay. Check out that babe. Would you look at the stems on her'? That's the woman I was hired to tail. She must be involved. - We're going in. - Good. Who are you? Why did you frame me? What? Who are you? What are you pilots doing in my house? You know damn well who I am. Don't play me for a fool or an idiot. Yeah, that's my job. Get out. I've never seen you before in my life. Then call the cops. They're looking for me. Might even get you a reward. Phone. You don't want the cops anywhere near this place, do you? So quit the charade and tell me, why did you do it? I didn't do it. I swear. It was my boyfriend, Sid. He found out Schwartz and I were having an affair. That's why you were meeting Schwartz at the hotel? Yes. Sid shot him in cold blood. Told me he'd do the same to me if I didn't keep my mouth shut. I'm a prisoner in my own home. Well, Sid's mother's house. Where is Sid now? Tell me, and you won't be a prisoner anymore. He's at the Prospect Park Carousel. He works there. It's where all the ex-jockeys end up. An ex-jockey-on-jockey murder. You won't regret this. I'm gonna clear my name and set you free. You're a little tall for my taste, but when this is all over, you can leave your slippers under my bed anytime. How about two pairs of slippers? Hola. George, it's Jonathan. Oh, Jonathan, wait a second. How do I know it's really you? Can't you tell from my voice? Maybe. I mean' you do sound kind of nasal. I know, I know. Tell me something that only you and I know. Last night' you and Ray snuggled and didn't include me. What does that have to do with anything? I believe it's you. So what's your 10-20? Our location? We're heading to the Prospect Park Carousel. All right, I will Tango and Foxtrot with you there. But you should probably know I think I'm being followed. - Really? - Mmm-hmm. By several agents. Possibly from... Multiple branches of the government. George, are you stoned? No, not so much anymore. It's kind of wearing off. Wait a second. We shouldn't be... We should stay off the phone. Hang up, hang up. Uh... Bye-bye, mamacita. Talk to you mañana. What am I... Man down. George is stoned. It's always the weak who fall first in battle. Last ride of the day. Last ride! That guy came to my reading. I signed his book and everything. Did you personalize it? A lot of times, that's what the fans want. If you don't do that, they get upset. I don't think that's why he framed me for murder. Hey, Ray, Jonathan. Hey. Hi, guys No, it's okay. I think I lost them. - Where'd you get that great bike? - From Bernard. Why are you guys in the navy? We're pilots for Aeromexico. We picked up disguises from Howard. You went there without me? Come on. You know how much I love going to Howard's. I'm sorry, George. You can come with us next time. - You want me to fill you in? - No, no, I'll catch on. I'm very intuitive. God, it's a beautiful Ferris wheel. It's a carousel, George. Well, it's... Oh, yeah. - Th at was for Schwartz - Who's Schwartz? - Hey, come on. - I'll pick it up as we go. You're coming downtown with us. Well, uptown, actually, and to the west. To the cops! You can take me in, dick, but you got nothing on me. Oh, I got plenty. The blonde gave us the goods. - What blonde? - George, please. - Okay. - Kitty ratted me out? Yeah, she told us everything. I only have one question, Why me? It was that article about you and your book in The Post. It was clear you were somebody who could be duped. Why were his pants around his ankles in the hotel room, huh? Yeah, Ray's very curious about that. We were painting the picture that you and Schwartz were lovers, had a quarrel. Figured that would stick. You got $3 bill written all over you. - Hey. - Wait a second. - What do you mean, we? - It was Kitty's idea. The pants at the ankles' everything. She wanted Schwartz dead. But I thought that you killed Schwartz out of green-eyed jealousy. What are you talking about? Schwartz made her the beneficiary of his will and his life insurance. She played him. That's why we knocked him off. And she was gonna split the money with you? Yeah. We were gonna leave town together, start a new life, away from the ponies. This is a terrible story. Gumball, you came for me. I had a dream about a gumball machine last night. Hello, Sid. Oh, my God! Gumball shot him! Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? You shouldn't throw a gun, they're like scissors. Why not? I'm getting your prints on the gun you just killed Sid with. Sorry, no bullets left. - But this one is loaded. And this is the gun Sid used to kill you and your friends during your little shootout. Please don't. Look, I just became a new dad to a beautiful boy named Spencer. His mothers are divorced lesbians, and I love him very much. Please don't do this. Stop crying. This isn't a book club. You plugged me. Go! I loved you. - Down! Get down! - I'm too young to be shot. Other way! Other way! Other way! No, no, no! I'm never going on a Ferris wheel again. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Drop your weapon! Ow! Look, look, look. See, I knew I was being followed. Hi, remember me? I'm not paranoid. You did a great job, Jonathan. Excellent detective work. Thank you, Officer Drake. Coming from you, that means a lot. That's why the boys and I got you these as a token of our appreciation. Look. Is this like making us honorary deputies? - No, they're just baseball caps. - I see. - Yeah, so... - Well, thank you. And how are you doing, Officer Drake? You know, with your issues? Yeah. Well, I did start to, uh, take my wife's birth control pills. But then, you know, I stopped and I got some therapy and now I'm doing much better. So, thank you for asking. Anytime. Okay. All cleared up? Guys, I'm really sorry I put your lives in danger. You know, I like these little brushes with death. Makes everything new again. I don't. I can't afford to die, Jonathan. I don't have health insurance. I'm so sorry, Ray. Look, I don't like to be the voice of reason, but now that I'm a dad, I guess it suits me, but you've gotta stop being a detective. It's too dangerous. I keep getting hurt. I don't know. The police gave us these hats. We must be doing something right. Oh, Jonathan. I like this hat. Yeah, now I don't feel so left out. Besides, Ray, can't retire just yet. Still have to find out who my real dad is. And you will, Jonathan. You will. Shall we? You know, I really do like that bag. Howard sells them, right? Does it have a false bottom? I have a false bottom. Well, you know, sometimes. I'm not wearing one now, but... George, what are you talking about? Well, have you ever seen these little undies that have pads on each cheek? Yeah, they make those for men? Yeah. Oh, yeah.
