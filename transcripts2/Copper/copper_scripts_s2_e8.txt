 Doctor, my baby girl
Hazel is sick.
 He said Kennedy shall be hung
by the neck until he be dead.
 Do you think your choices
will not haunt you?
 If you think
you'll intimidate me
 into dropping my bid,
 well, you're as stupid
as you are duplicitous!
 Lansing's out of control.
He must be contained.
 Is this official
police business, sir, or--
 What this is, Mr. Maguire,
is you showing appreciation
 for being saved
from the gallows!
 - Missus Corcoran.
- I'm looking for Kevin.
 Ellen stopped by today.
She's pregnant.
 You slept with my wife
again, you son of a bitch!
 The child is not mine,
Kevin.
 I was waiting all night
for you to come to bed.
 You never did.
 I will sleep
when Kennedy's dead.
 Well, tonight the world
will be free of him.
 Amen.
 But first we must pay respects
to Kevin's wife.
 Mmm... yes.
 That poor woman.
 Such desperation
to go so far.
 Even in my darkest days...
 Who can say?
 But surely she did not
deserve to die,
 unlike Kennedy.
 Robert, I think
your presence there
 might be a victory
to him.
 I think perhaps...
 ...It might be a waste
of your time.
 No, I want
to see it happen.
 I want to see Kennedy choke out
his last breath.
 What good
will seeing that do?
 It's how I will close the book
on the whole sordid affair.
 For father...
 ...But mostly for you.
 I'm burying her
with my daughter.
 It's where she belongs.
 Kevin, you know
the Church's teachings.
 She committed
a mortal sin.
 The new archbishop would
never allow a burial
 on consecrated ground.
 Then don't tell him.
 It's not so easy,
son.
 Every interment goes through
his office.
 And this new fella,
 he's no Dagger John Hughes,
believe me.
 Hughes at least
appreciated loopholes.
 So the two of them
are forever apart.
 - I'm sorry--
- Mother and child?
 Kevin, I'd be banished
to Canarsie
 if I went against
the Church.
 All because of rules
made by man.
 Now if Ellen were to be
cremated...
 I thought that's another rule.
 The Church is
against cremation.
 And her ashes scattered
alongside Maggie's grave...
 In the dead of night...
 No one'd ever know.
 You have Dagger John's
affinity for loopholes.
 Faith depends on our belief
in the unknowable.
 Will you join me
in prayer?
 You go ahead, Father.
 I lost God
about nine minutes
 into The Battle
of the Wilderness.
 "To everything
there is a season,
 and a time to every purpose
under the heaven."
 "a time to be born,
and a time to die...
 ...a time to kill..."
 "We urge- no, uh,
we demand that the Board of Aldermen
 select General Donovan's bid
 for the proposed
new Croton Aqueduct."
 We urge that
The Board of Aldermen
 acts with good sense
and alacrity...
 ...in approving
General Donovan's bid,
 et cetera, et cetera.
 How long, Donovan?
 How long will I be
your pawn?
 Is that how you see
our collaboration?
 Oh, is that what
you call this,
 this blackmail operation
you're running,
 using me to secure your bid
for this foolishness?
 Would you rather the buccaneer
Lansing get the project?
 I would prefer neither.
 The Croton Aqueduct
is sufficient.
 And yet its most staunch
advocates agree that system
 will support a population
of no more than two million.
 And in what fantasy land...
 ...will we need more water
than that?
 That's the problem with you
Anglo-Saxons,
 you lack a talent
for grandeur.
 Someday, Donovan,
I will simply refuse
 to do your bidding.
 Ah, I find
adjusting to the reality
 of one's station in life
 is like a balm
for the soul.
 I see our collaboration
as being mutually beneficial.
 You help me get
what I need,
 and I secure for you
that which you desire.
 Mister O'Hearn!
 The tenement well
Hazel used is located here.
 The water supply flowing
into it begins here,
 where Collect Pond
used to be.
 A well's water
is always a reflection
 of the history
of its source.
 What is the history
of Collect Pond?
 A dumping spot for tanneries,
slaughterhouses, cattle pens.
 A sewer would have
cleaner water.
 Oh, Kevin, come in.
 Sit down.
 Uh, Sara, I was uh...
hoping you could help me out.
 I need to...
to pick a dress for Ellen.
 Of course.
We'll choose a beautiful color.
 What was her favorite?
 Um...
I, I can't remember.
 I don't think
I ever knew.
 Mister Corcoran,
if it please you, stay here.
 Sara and I, we'll...
 ...we'll get your Missus
ready for cooling.
 Back home,
I have readied the dead
 for the next life.
 Excuse me, Robert.
 I'm not staying.
 I just wanted to thank you
for the invitation
 to this evening's hanging.
 The invitation
didn't come from me.
 It arrived this morning
to the club.
 My wife remains
your ardent supporter.
 For all her
unfortunate instincts,
 she does sometimes
recognize what is right.
 Putting Kennedy's terror
to rest
 and trying to keep us
a family.
 I'm sorry for the things
I said about your mother.
 Truly sorry.
 For mother's sake alone
 I will attempt
to accept your apology.
 Just to be clear,
that gun was not loaded.
 I will see you
at the hanging.
 My fire's burnin' hot now!
 Damn rebel!
 Huh?! Is that really
what you think?
 Carrying on
like a loon in there.
 Jesus, Kennedy,
you're a bit touched!
 I'll be home soon!
 Sanity is for the unchained.
 Hey, Major, Missus,
come on in.
 'Tis there I'd sit
and cry my fill
 And every tear
would turn a mill
 Is go dte
tu mo mhuirnin slan...
 I don't think
I can find the words.
 Don't have to,
Matthew.
 You and I have been through
enough together.
 A few words
won't change that.
 Sara,
I can't thank you enough.
 She looks beautiful,
and at rest.
 We were glad to do it.
 She is at peace now...
with the Lord.
 Corky...
 Your Aunt Maeve is quite
an interesting woman.
 I was always terrified of her.
 She used to beat my cousin
with a wire belt.
 You certain there's nothing
I can arrange?
 More food, spirits?
 Railway ticket
out of town?
 Oh no, Major,
thank you.
 My heart aches
for your grief, Kevin.
 I hope you find solace
amidst the pain.
 I appreciate the two of you
making the trip,
 but I'm holding up.
 I hope I did not
upset him further.
 For all our differences,
Corky and I share one trait;
 we do not receive sympathy
with much grace.
 So that's an Irish wake.
 Mourning and drinking
and singing
 all rolled into one.
 I prefer the way
we do it.
 Somber affairs mark the somber
passing of somber lives.
 Somber or not,
these events remind us
 we only have limited time
on this earth, Robert.
 Seeing Kevin and Matthew
together
 reminded me of that.
 The war?
 No place like the battlefield
 to learn about
the fleeting nature of life.
 Every day, I wondered,
"Would I be next?"
 Oh my God.
 I can't even imagine.
 Until I accepted the truth
that was before me.
 The truth?
 I have no control,
nor will I ever.
 These nitwits...
 ...think the drink, the opium,
to be a result of my soft life.
 What does it matter
what other people think?
 In truth, it's the opposite.
 They help soothe the agony
in my vanished leg
 and clawing in my gut.
 They keep the idea of
an alternative ending...
 ...at bay.
 Oh, Robert...
 Amidst the chaos,
 I'm so glad we found
each other.
 Major General Dix
has asked me
 to come and witness
the preparations
 for the execution.
 I'll be back shortly.
 All the staff have gone
to the parade.
 I'm going to enjoy
the rare quiet.
 When boyhood's
fire was in my blood
 I read of ancient freemen
 For Greece and Rome
who bravely led
 Three hundred men
and three men
 And then I prayed
I yet might see
 Our fetters rent in twain
 And Ireland,
long a province
 Be a nation once again!
 A nation once again
 And Ireland,
long a province
 You foilin' my plan
of escape?
 Sounds like you have a saloon
on your hands.
 You plannin' on coming in
 or are you gonna hide out here
all day?
 Heard your people
consider it a bad omen
 for women in my condition
to attend.
 Ill tidings
for the baby.
 Since when does Eva Heissen
believe in old superstition?
 Just one breath
at a time...
 that's how we endure
these things.
 I'm sick of superstition.
 I'm tired of rules
 that don't consider
what it's like
 actually being
in this world.
 Kevin...
 I'm afraid I may have caused
your Ellen to worry.
 What do you mean?
 I encountered her on the street
the other day.
 She asked about my pregnancy,
asked about you.
 So?
 I may have inadvertently
given her the impression
 that you were the father.
 Well, how so?
 I can't be.
The timing's all off, right?
 Of course it is.
 But how could Ellen
know that?
 I could have assured her,
but I didn't.
 Well, sadly,
what we coulda done different,
 don't matter much now,
Eva.
 Have you got a name yet?
 I'm going back and forth.
Nothing German.
 A nice American name.
 Yeah.
 No sense in looking
to the past.
 Major General Dix,
I came to inquire
 about the details
of Kennedy's execution
 and now he's gone?
 The traitor escaped
and stabbed a guard.
 Soldiers and coppers
are scouring
 the Downtown area.
 I hope he's Downtown.
 What's the problem?
Can we not move any faster?
 It's the parade, sir.
I have no way around the crowd.
 Pull over.
I'll go by foot.
 Whoa!
 Within the bounds
of your precinct
 is an entire tenement
full of very sick people,
 Irish and black alike...
 in dire need
of blood transfusions.
 I can help them if I can find
healthy, fit donors!
 News headline:
 "People are sick and dying
in Five Points."
 Thank you for the update
on neighborhood affairs.
 Your younger patrolmen
are the best candidates.
 They are active
and of the right age.
 This police force
is not going to mix races
 in the name of magic!
 So a month ago
 I should have left
my black hands in my pockets
 and my science
in my own head?!
 I didn't have to walk
into a building under siege,
 risk my own well-being,
 or ask my wife to work
with me all night
 to help keep you alive!
 It's Saint Patrick's Day!
 I'm about a battalion
short of men
 needed to keep order!
 But a few of the lads
 may be available.
 Tell them to meet me
at the tenement on Leonard
 as soon as
they can get there.
 Isn't it amazing that Robert
and I can wear the same clothes?
 I always considered him
a much smaller man.
 Certainly not in
achievement or standing.
 I was gonna flee the city,
 but I thought I'd drop in
and invite you along with me.
 How thoughtful.
 Despite
your occasional cruelty,
 I hold friendly sentiments
toward ya.
 I hold nothing for you
but mockery, you fool!
 Well then...
 It's time I finally
changed your opinion.
 You will die today...
Try as you might.
 Oh, that's enough,
Missus Morehouse.
 No!
 You fight like a dirty
guttersnipe!
 It's arousin',
I must admit.
 But I will not hesitate
to end your life.
 Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
 Wait, shh...
 Not here.
 The staff will be back
from the parade soon.
 I'll come with you,
but we must hurry.
 You search the top one?
 - Yes, of course.
- The left side as well?
 There's nothing there!
 Maybe the notes
are tucked away.
 What about the other end?
 I thought you said the money
was here.
 We can't travel
without resources.
 I told you, the Morehouse
men don't involve their women
 in money matters.
 Oh, forgive me.
 I didn't realize
we would have visitors.
 Elizabeth, did you offer
Mister Kennedy a drink?
 A brandy man,
if I remember correctly.
 You know, I would love
one last taste
 of the blessed
Morehouse stock.
 Dear, be a good wife
 and pour us men a drink,
would you?
 Or would you prefer
something stronger,
 my good man?
 Thank you.
We've got to be going on soon.
 I think a brandy
would be wonderful.
 You always considered
yourself clever,
 A clever man who can
manipulate and exploit,
 but unfortunately a firearm
is much more powerful
 than a wealthy wiseass.
 Where's your money?!
 Truthfully, I haven't seen
a silver piece in an age.
 When father left,
I found I was literate
 in all things but finance.
 Is that so?
 Argh!
 Your drinks, gentlemen.
 I do appreciate
your hospitality.
 Mmm...
 But, we've got to be off soon
and uh...
 Elizabeth has decided
to leave with me.
 Really?
 That's a revelation.
 So don't make me
ask you again
 or I will shoot you.
 Where is your
goddamn money?
 Maybe I have a few bob
stashed away.
 There.
 All the Morehouse notes
yet to be deposited.
 The key!
 Uh...
 Mmm...
 So clever...
 Always so clever.
 Robert! Are you okay?
 I'm okay.
 She is first mine.
 Ungh!
 You know the most frightened
I ever seen ya?
 Was you holdin' Maggie
 them first few days
after she was born.
 God...
 I was terrified of that
gorgeous little creature.
 Your whole body
go stiff.
 You looked like...
 ...like that little babe
in your arms
 was plannin' to devour you
at any moment.
 It was nothing that
could have been expected
 or imagined.
 I've been meaning to say,
Kevin,
 she looks stunning,
your Ellen.
 Christ, Sybil.
 You promised
you weren't gonna say that.
 Shut up.
It's a free country.
 God forbid I should
say something nice.
 Every wake we ever been to,
 whether the departed
is eight or 80,
 "Ah, they look
beautiful, they do."
 - She goes on and on.
- Well, she does.
 She's dead, Sybil.
 How the hell can you
be good lookin'
 when you're dead?
 Keep it up
 and they'll be building
a box for you right quick.
 You remember
Bridey O'Halloran?
 Oh...
 Bridey O'Halloran.
You remember Bridey O'Halloran?
 She had some mug
on her.
 She was as ugly a witch
as ever walked the earth.
 It's bad luck
to disrespect the dead!
 We go to the wake,
 and this one's saying
to Mister O'Halloran
 "Ah, she looks
lovely in the box, she does."
 The dead are just dead, okay?
 They're neither
good lookin' or not,
 'cause it don't matter.
 Oh, stick it, you big oaf!
 Sorry.
 Hey, at least now
it's a proper wake.
 So what's next?
 We start swinging from the trees
and craving bananas?
 And what do they call
you Irish but savages?
 You talk to a copper
like that?!
 I apologize, sir.
I was out of line.
 - Momma!
- You know what?
 To hell with Sullivan's
crack orders!
 Sara!
 Would you and Hattie mind
checking on the cart outside?
 Robert?
 Robert!
 You're not supposed
to be up there!
 True, but good God...
 Imagine if
you were found out.
 You might have been forced
up these steps.
 Come on, come up.
 No. No, I will not.
 And you don't have to keep
reminding me
 of my debt to you.
 Humor me.
 Oh my God.
 It really does give you
the chills, doesn't it?
 Annie Reilly.
 Where you been?
 Around.
 I um...
I heard about your Ellen.
 I'm so sorry.
 Well, thanks for coming.
 It means a lot to me.
 I have been planning
to come see you.
 I have found a nice family
to live with.
 Oh yeah?
 Well, is it, is it safe?
Are they kind?
 They are gentle.
 They own a farm
in Jersey,
 a place called
New Milford,
 on the banks
of the Hackensack river.
 For a little girl,
anything beats Five Points.
 I told them my name
was Annie Corcoran;
 that my father
is a New York City detective.
 Is that okay?
 Of course it is, child.
 You promise me
you'll be careful, Annie.
 Annie Corcoran.
 And bring me back
some country chickens
 now and again.
 Now eat before you stand.
Get your strength back.
 Transfusion is working.
 Everyone seems to be
responding well.
 Matthew, come here!
 Breathe...
Breathe for me, baby.
 Hazel, honey,
breathe for me!
 I believed in you!
I trusted you!
 She was fine.
 She was getting
stronger.
 Let Matthew tend
to this girl.
 What the hell is goin' on?
 I told you this fool
was no better
 than some cracker doctor.
 You don't give
a damn about us!
 Go on now.
This party's over!
 Leave us be,
damn it!
 Matthew, time to go.
 I am what I heal.
Today I am nothing.
 Many of those patients were
beyond the reach of medicine,
 and some still you saved.
 Think on the last time
we were together in Virginia.
 For months
we planned escape,
 but it didn't work out.
 Yet here we are,
years later, together.
 You do what you can.
The rest is up to God.
 I may have faith,
 but too much dependence
on God is...
 ...only for the helpless,
 and I can solve
this problem.
 Even with all your learning,
Matthew,
 you are not the answer
to the world's troubles.
 No man is.
 The world will know the loss
of Hazel Turnow.
 And it will not lose
one more like her.
 You must be blessed
with an abundance of luck,
 what with
Alderman Bartlett
 strangled to death
with his pants down,
 the most vocal opponent
of your Aqueduct bid and of you,
 meeting such a sordid end.
 Ah, the poor man.
 I offered up
a rosary for him,
 past Sunday mass.
 Please, it's more likely
you danced a jig
 over his demise.
 I don't tend to gloat,
but I do like to win.
 You have been winning
 since you got
to these shores.
 But I have to ask...
 No rich daddy back home?
 Nobody to stake you
in the new world?
 I was one of 14 children
 raised in
a mud-floored hut
 outside of Sneem
in the county of Kerry.
 Need I do the math
for you?
 You're a keen operator,
Donovan.
 But even with Bartlett gone,
 you will not get
the Aqueduct project
 unless you get Lansing
to withdraw his bid.
 I believe my proposal
will win the day,
 and you and I will profit
 as the properties we share
will explode in value.
 So far he has refused.
 What makes you
so certain
 he will come around
to your position?
 I'm sure that you
will see that
 chief among my greatest traits
is flexibility.
 I can adjust
my negotiation style...
 ...if required.
 Who's that?
 I'm the Angel of Darkness,
you orange bastard.
 Help! Sheehan!
 Shh, shh, shh...
 It's a Catholic holiday.
 All your staff are down
at Eva's Paradise...
 Kerosene?
 ...Spending Donovan's money
on whores and whiskey.
 You got two choices.
 You can sign this paper now...
 ...or I turn you into
a flaming scarecrow.
 What is this?
 I'm not paid to know
or care.
 You really think you clowns
will get away with this?
 If I'm a clown...
 ...then there's only
one choice for you.
 No.
 Please, spare me!
 Please, God in heaven,
put that match out!
 Look, you bastards have won!
Please!
 I don't want to die.
 Jesus, you're embarrassing me,
Lansing.
 Now sign.
 Happy Saint Patrick's Day.
 I have never seen
such poor white folks...
 ...just wretched.
 They're living worse
than half the slaves
 I ever knew.
 At least they are free.
 Free to do what?
 Live like some kind
of sick animals,
 unable to fend
for themselves?
 Most of 'em,
the Irish especially,
 arrived here
with nothing,
 so they are forced to fight
for the scraps.
 I'm not trying
to defend whites
 who see fit to own people
as property, but...
 ...in my experience,
at least they had manners.
 Momma!
 So long as you say
thank you and please
 and know what fork
to use first
 you are a good person?
 Do not try to change
what I'm saying.
 Just...civilized.
 Well, we're equals here,
at least by law,
 and we are carving out a life
for ourselves and--
 A life?
 Here?!
 Life has space, Sara,
and sky and...
 ...privacy.
 Clean air to breathe.
 On the plantation,
the only privacy we had
 was what daddy
wanted to give us.
 Here it's whatever
we can take,
 for ourselves.
 I don't aim to be ungrateful.
 I'm just...
 ...not accustomed
to your Five Points.
 You uh...
You don't have to go, Annie.
 I do.
 I just wanted to let you know
that I'm sorry, Kevin.
 It wasn't your fault.
 We were broken...
long before you got here.
 I just wish that....
 How many wishes
do each of us have?
 Some get more than others,
I guess.
 I was telling the story
the other day,
 on how you took me
to Central Park
 and we went sleigh riding.
 Yeah,
that was a fun day.
 Even your Ellen
had fun.
 She was happy.
 I wish that...
 ...we could all have had
more days like that.
 Ever since a copper
offered me an egg,
 I have learned
to have good days.
 Thank you
for never giving up on me.
 I am always so proud of you.
 Matthew is just wastin'
his time.
 He is changing lives,
saving lives.
 I know you have been free
for a while,
 but I cannot believe
that any white man
 is gonna care
about the words
 he's putting down
on that paper.
 That is a strong possibility.
 But not putting
those words down
 guarantees that no man,
white or black,
 will ever read them.
 You tell my friends
these last words!
 I am to hang,
and you are my brothers,
 and I happily die for you,
for my country.
 And I am not sorry
and I am not afraid.
 It's better this be my fate
 than fall on bended knee
to the Union!
 Trust to luck,
trust to luck
 Stare fate in the face.
 For your heart
will be easy
 When it's in the right place
 I'm not gonna lie to ya, Kevin,
 and you can do
what you like to me.
 You can shoot me through
the head or the heart.
 Don't tempt me.
 But I loved Ellen.
 Maybe not as much as you,
 maybe in a different way,
 but I did.
 I still do.
 And I love you too,
ya bastard,
 more than any brother
I ever could have had.
 I know I done things
that can't be forgiven.
 But just remember,
 I will kill or die for you
any day of the week.
 All you need to do is ask.
 I know, Francis.
 Do you realize that...
 ...on Saint Patrick's Day,
 we celebrate the day
he died?
 When I was a boy,
I always assumed...
 ...we were drinking
to his birth.
 I was never that hopeful.
 Our ship she's ready
to sail away
 And it's come
my sweet comrades
 O'er the stormy sea...
 Her snow white wings
are all unfurled
 And soon we'll swim
in a watery world.
