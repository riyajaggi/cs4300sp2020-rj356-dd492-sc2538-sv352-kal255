 I need you to go through this
 and get me anything
I can use against Tammany.
 You are gonna
take on Donovan.
 I already did.
 Mister Eustace.
 I want Corcoran
brought to me, alive.
 You wanna live?
 - Tell me who sent you.
- Eustace.
 You said...
 I lied.
 The killing can end
or it can continue with you.
 Well, you've made
quite a mess, Detective.
 Here's to the new
King of Five Points!
 Doctor Freeman.
 What's wrong?
 The president has been assas--
 The president
has been assassinated.
 Thank you for allowing us
this private moment.
 Thank you
for your generosity.
 No amount matches the honor
of serving this man.
 A Mister Eustace, sir.
 Do make yourself at home.
 There's a bar behind us
if you'd like a drink.
 I know Detective Corcoran
entrusted your son, Robert,
 with the files he stole
from General Donovan.
 I have no idea
what you're talking about.
 You do, and either you help
the organization
 by turning over
the Donovan files,
 or the organization launches
an all-out war
 against the Morehouses.
 What constitutes
an all-out war?
 Believe it or not,
 a man could lose
a whole lot more
 than just his money.
 Even if the papers
were hidden here,
 my son now controls all parts
of the family business,
 including the lock boxes.
 Well, this could be a day
of liberation...
 ...for the files
and your balls.
 If I find the documents,
 I suppose my friends
in the governor's office
 may also express interest.
 Tammany owns both houses
of the state legislature.
 Now I say you would be smart
to start another concern
 with preferential treatment
from Tammany.
 Liberation.
 I was lying
in Armory Square Hospital
 after losing
this godforsaken leg--
 In a lush, private room,
no doubt.
 Young, beautiful nurses
adhering to your every desire.
 And the president
himself entered.
 You never told us that.
 Lincoln studied me
for a moment,
 and then he took my hand
and he said,
 "Major Morehouse,
men upon crutches
 are orators
for this Union,
 for your very appearance
speaks louder than tongues."
 The man had a craft of words,
that cannot be denied.
 A toast!
 We three haven't
shared a drink together
 since our discharge
from the front.
 To the days that made us
 and the man
who let us come home.
 Through an informant
 on Captain Lafayette Baker's
staff,
 I have been tracking
the pursuit
 of John Wilkes Booth
and David Herold.
 I still hold the commission
as Major.
 Why do I think I know
where this is going and... no!
 Before you dismiss it,
give the matter thought.
 With your skills
as a detective
 and your knowledge
of the region--
 Which is exactly the reason
I'm not goin' south.
 Gentlemen,
we have the opportunity
 to catch these assassins,
to be heroes.
 You are already a hero!
 To be forever remembered
by this country.
 As an American.
 Yes, which is what
you have desired to be called
 since you stepped
on these shores.
 A train car and waiting horses
can be arranged by nightfall.
 You go. My days
are filled with patients.
 I was meant to be a rich shit.
 Hunting trips upstate,
 screwing debutantes
on the beach.
 Major--
 Instead I joined
a cause and lost a leg
 because I was inspired
to preserve the Union
 and end slavery.
 He has a point.
 Matthew, the war's over!
 We fought under Lincoln
 hoping that we could belong
to this country.
 This is not a battle,
but a mission.
 You would be...
 offering a service
to my country,
 and the man who gave me,
my wife and my people
 the first strains
of true freedom.
 We depart at first light!
 Have you forgotten?
 This man...
 ...built your
prosthetic for the wrong leg,
 leaving you
with two left feet?!
 That's right!
 Come now, I couldn't...
I hadn't eaten in three days!
 I could hardly see,
 much less properly build
an artificial limb.
 In a train car,
headed south.
 Not sure what you put
in my drink, Major.
 Patriotism.
 A sense of duty
and courage.
 And now we're headed
straight to the very hells
 we left behind, huh?
 Hey, hey,
what happened to the courage?
 Uh, faces, names, towns,
landscapes...
 I remember too much.
 As do I.
 For all the fallen men...
 I still think of them most.
 Mother and daughter.
 Matthew, stop.
 It was a different time.
 We were different people.
 Sirs, from here on down
 I would stay away
from the windows.
 Why's that?
 The original Mason Dixon line
cut through here.
 Not everyone is a Yankee
'cause they live in the North.
 I see in you a friend
much like, perhaps,
 Robert sees
in that downtown detective,
 so I've extended myself,
located the files.
 However,
in order to obtain them
 I'll need something
with which to trade.
 Unlike other
downtown characters,
 I can give you this.
 Add a zero
and we have a deal.
 One of the joys
of the City Treasury...
 always plenty of zeroes
to go around.
 Warmer than New York.
 Air smells better, too.
 Hey, you know,
when we were last here,
 all I could smell was blood
and flesh and death,
 and all the screamin'...
 ...everyone shoutin' or cryin' out
for God or their mother.
 I goddamn got used to it.
 I never got used to it.
 Matthew, does Virginia
feel different
 now that you're a free man?
 No better than
the last time I rode through here.
 I just fear that
too many Virginians
 won't know the difference.
 Free or not,
I'm still black.
 Booth and
Herold were headed south and east.
 We suspect one man,
Mister Rutt Waymond,
 in aiding and abetting.
 Captain Baker requests
 you begin your search
at Waymond's.
 Very good.
Thank you, Captain.
 Major,
keep your wits about you.
 There are scattered bands
of rebs wandering the land.
 And they ain't all convinced
the hostilities is ended.
 Savages.
 We should give him
a proper Christian burial.
 We don't know
what's lurking in these woods.
 We'll do it
on the way back.
 He's been there for a while.
A little more time won't hurt.
 Forward!
 Yup, see that?
A black man.
 Get used to it.
 Whoa.
 I'll head in here,
get directions
 to Waymond's house.
 If there's any trouble,
 you start ridin'
and start shootin'.
 Major, your leg.
 Morphine was invented
for a reason.
 It's a temporary solution.
 I could adjust your saddle
to ease the chafing.
 You want to dismount here, now?
 At the store,
they said Waymond kept bees.
 This must be the place.
 A night or so ago,
 two men rode through this area
on horseback.
 One with a broken leg.
 Did you happen to see them,
Mister Waymond?
 Who's askin'?
 We are agents
of the American army.
 Who are free to shoot
who we want,
 when we want,
no repercussions.
 Well you're the only
new faces I seen.
 Well, what about
your neighbors?
 Ain't heard nothing about 'em
 and I haven't been to town
in days.
 Huh.
 We stopped by Rutledge's
general store
 as we passed through,
 and Mister Rutledge said
you were in yesterday
 buying feed
for your horses.
 - What's he doin"?
- Mm... No idea.
 You never really know
with him.
 Well, that's my property--
 So you were in town,
but you weren't.
 It's strange
how that could be.
 John Wilkes Booth,
David Herold...
 You ever hear
those names?
 Well, I don't...
 What're you...?
Is this all...?
 Saw your hives
on the way in.
 Good honey season?
 If you forget a storm or two.
 Good season
usually means room for expansion.
 You buildin' new frames?
 Been working
all spring, busting--
 You see, we're
thinkin' Booth and Herold
 spent their night here
in your home,
 eatin' your food
and drinkin' your fine whiskey.
 Damnit, I told y'all
I've never heard of no such men!
 Well, I don't believe you!
 Aghhh! Agghhh!
 Fine! Sure!
Your boys came through.
 But I ain't no sympathizer,
 just a hospitality man,
 which you Yankees clearly
know nothin' about.
 And, yeah,
one of them had a broken leg.
 He asked for booze
to ease his pain.
 Where'd they head?
 God!
 - Come on.
- South!
 This mornin' they headed south
towards Champlain.
 Now, Major, let's get
some honey for that leg compress.
 The honey should help quell
the wound's sepsis.
 But we'll need to access
proper medical supplies soon.
 The proper medical
supplies have been acquired.
 Now let's get a move on.
 We can be certain the traitor,
Booth, is not resting.
 Major...
 The contagion here is--
 Now come, Matthew,
put my leg back on.
 We should have gone east
at the fork, not south.
 Matthew, I thought
you knew this land.
 I was a slave nearby,
 not larking about
the countryside.
 Either way,
this should lead to Little River.
 Whoa.
 Hey there!
 Hold it. Whoa, whoa.
 Now you boys...
 Got the look of Yankees.
 Stink of them, too.
 You raise those guns,
 you die...
Right here and now.
 What brings you
'round here?
 We have every right
to be here.
 We should take
these fine horses.
 I'm a New York City detective,
 and we're in pursuit
of a fugitive.
 John Wilkes Booth?
 No. No, we're not army.
 It's a bank robber,
 an Irishman by the name
of Francis Maguire.
 A runty little fellow.
 With one good eye.
 That so?
Well...
 We ain't seen anyone
like that.
 So, you say you're a detective?
 Like in those
Edgar Allan Poe stories?
 Those are among
my favorite tales.
 I knew the man himself.
 Mister Edgar Allan Poe.
 Is that some kinda Yankee lie?
 My mother was friends
with him.
 When I was a boy,
he came to our house
 and read us
"The Tell-Tale Heart" himself.
 That's amazing!
 A friend of Mister Poe!
 You boys look like
you could use a rest.
 Why don't you help yourselves
to the cook fire?
 Where you headed?
 Home.
 We're Kentucky boys.
 Been fighting nearly
three years.
 Glad this damn war
is over.
 Good luck.
 We'd be stupid
not to take these mounts.
 No!
 We're Kentuckians,
not Texas horse thieves.
 Oh, if we see Booth,
 rest assured
we'll shoot him first.
 We're soldiers.
 Have no use
for cowardly assassins
 of any stripe.
 Let's move along.
 Come on.
Hey, Harvey, come on.
 Sure coulda used that horse.
Good lookin' horses.
 So it's the true?
 You knew Edgar Allan Poe?
 It's true as
chasing a bank robber
 named Francis Maguire.
 Whoa.
 Holy shit.
 The battlefield.
 When we passed
the Spotsylvania Courthouse,
 I wondered.
 Christ Almighty,
I can still taste the hell.
 We entered the fight
from there,
 in those trees,
 moved across
and separated from the regiment.
 Then the cannon assault
began.
 You were shot there,
Major,
 then crawled to cover
in that ditch there.
 The two of you
followed me.
 - And that's when...
- My leg...
 You're wrong about the ditch.
 I remember this tree.
We took cover behind it.
 It's too shallow.
 And I recall there
being a rock.
 Could have been this dip.
 Then again,
my eyes were blind
 in the haze of smoke.
 Christ, you'd just...
 ...kill anyone
who was in your way.
 I wonder how many of my own men
I sent to death?
 The biggest moment
in our lives we were side by side.
 Yet we can't agree
upon the location.
 At once dreaming,
 yet more awake than any man
could possibly be.
 I expect these memories
will forever metamorphose.
 Freeman, you poet.
 Are you trying to say
you've forgotten
 where you buried my leg?
 Goddamned Battle
of the Wilderness.
 What the hell is this?
 Maybe they have news.
 Our New York boys, eh?
 You're late.
The good news is--
 Late? We can't be late.
 We were sent here
to capture Booth.
 Well, we got the bastard.
So you're late.
 That can't be! We have orders
from Captain Baker
 to capture the assassins
and bring them back alive!
 Alive, Matthew,
it's our duty!
 Where're you takin' him?
 Over to Belle Plain
until further orders.
 Is that Herold there?
 Indeed.
 Son of a bitch is gonna
be swingin'
 when I bring his murdering ass
back to Washington.
 'Bout ready, boys?
 Yes, sir! Yup!
 All right, gentlemen.
 Lieutenant, wait.
 Did the traitor Booth
speak before he died?
 Well, he was shot
in the throat,
 so the great Shakespearean's
words were barely audible.
 What, damnit, did he say?
 He said, "Tell my mother
that I died for my country."
 Asked one of my men
to put his hands up to his face.
 Then he said,
"Useless, useless."
 He's a jackass.
 But at least he got me
a government reward!
 Woo!
 "Useless" indeed.
 We are the useless ones.
 We should have left New York
the morning Lincoln died!
 Major, we did the best
we could.
 Booth and Herold are captured.
That's all that matters now.
 Bullshit!
 If we didn't stop to put honey
on my goddamn leg
 we would have been
the captors!
 Why I thought we three...
 There's nothin'
left for us here.
 We should start
headin' back.
 The Major is not
healthy enough to risk a long ride.
 The leg... if gangrene sets in,
anything can happen.
 What can we do?
 The plantation.
 Matthew, no.
 It's just a few more miles
from here.
 Last I heard Doctor Purvis
still owns the land.
 We could get the proper
medical supplies.
 A free black,
an Irish Mick,
 and a useless white protestant
walk into battle!
 Robert, come back here now!
 You both realize that
coincidence brought us together,
 nothing more!
 Freeman,
you seemed useful.
 Corky, you Downtown
papist bastard--
 Major, you are not yourself!
 So you ended up
in the same ditch next to me
 and happened to be a good shot.
That makes us friends?
 Robert, slow down.
 No morphine, no drink.
 My leg hurts worse
than the day I lost it!
 If only we could get soused
 and forget this whole trip
ever--
 Your leg is at risk
of gangrene
 and needs a cure,
not more numbing!
 You are the noble Negro
with all the answers.
 What's next?!
 Major, you watch your mouth!
 Where is the "cure,"
dear Matthew?! Huh?!
 At the place
we swore never to return!
 There?
 We have to go back there?
 God.
 Everything's fine.
 A little closer, Clara,
 so we can compare and contrast
the texture and tone.
 I am so blessed to have you,
my daughter,
 for studies such as this.
 Your perfect skin,
alongside--
 Who's there?!
 Good God, Matthew!
 Where'd you come across
this runaway slave?
 I was never your slave.
 I was a prisoner
bidin' my time.
 Now I'm a doctor
healin' a friend.
 What in hell is this?
 Oh. My field master
inflicted the wounds,
 not I.
 But isn't it remarkable
what the human body can sustain?
 Zeke, you do realize
that by law
 Purvis is no longer
your master?
 I stay on my own accord.
 Purvis pays wages now.
 Clara, do you remember me?
 Keep away from my daughter!
 She hasn't been the same
since those savage Yankee troops
 came through here.
 You've grown up
since I saw you last.
 But not enough
to be a part of this.
 I like the way
Zeke's back looks.
 His skin is like the bark
 on my pretty sycamore
out front.
 So...
 The baboon's boys
are just more animals.
 Direct me to your creasotum,
gauze and plaster right now.
 The thing you Yankees
do not understand
 is that your side
may have beaten Lee,
 but the South is
and always will be,
 a separate country!
 Shut up!
 Corky, give me that bottle!
 And your belt.
 He'll need somethin'
to bite down on.
 This wasn't fun
the first time around.
 Major, open your mouth.
 Come on, that's enough.
 You ready?
 Take the right!
Here! Here!
 Take the left!
 Here! Here! Here!
 Move it! Move! Move!
 Run! Shoot!
 There!
 Let's sweep the area.
 Meet the boys out front
of the house.
 Move.
 Matthew?
 Oh no!
 Gillian!
 How did you...?
 Oh, shhhh...
 You and your mother were trying
to escape the shooting.
 Oh, I never meant for this!
 For you!
 I never meant this for you!
This, this war, this...
 My escape, I...
 I mean, these were just women,
huh?
 Mother and daughter,
innocent civilians.
 Christ.
 The Major and I were aimin'
in this direction.
 I've known
Gillian Purvis since she was born.
 And I've known her mother
my entire life.
 We had no idea.
If we had...
 Heal her.
You have to!
 - Oh, I can't.
- I've seen you.
 No, not this.
I can't!
 At least stabilize her.
 You said Purvis was a doctor.
We'll turn her over to him.
 Okay, bring your handkerchief.
Hold the wound right here.
 Okay.
 Shh...
 Okay, okay, okay, yeah.
 Multiple gunshot wounds...
 Only God knows
what the bullets hit.
 Within minutes,
at this rate of loss,
 she'll bleed out. I...
 Then let's take her
to the doctor.
 It's beyond anyone's skill.
 And the doctor inside
is her father.
 If he sees her
like this, I...
 Shhh...
 Kill me.
 Goddamnit, no!
 Shhh...
 I'll do this.
 Matthew.
 No, no, no!
 It's okay.
 No.
 It's okay, okay?
 Okay.
 Corky, Freeman...
 What I said to you both about
our meeting being coincidence--
 Major, you don't have to.
 Let me speak, Matthew.
 Yes, we met through
coincidence--
 None of us need
to explain anything to each other.
 Still, we did not survive
the bloodiest battles
 of our nation's history
 or remain friends
after being mustered out
 because of coincidence.
 Coincidence don't make three men
go on a journey,
 tracking the nation's
most infamous murderer,
 and we wouldn't have found
ourselves back there...
 A return to our worst memory.
 To a decision
which revealed our sameness,
 when we three seemed
the most unlikely of friends.
 I am so glad
to be done with war.
 Kevin, thank you for coming.
 Come, Matthew, I'll give you
a ride to your door.
 Oh, no thank you, Major.
 I think I'll enjoy
the morning walk.
 He's a good man.
 Each of us will always
be trying to convince ourselves
 that we are good, Corky.
 - Corky!
- Hey.
 I've been pacin'
Baxter Street for days.
 As nervous a boy
as I've ever seen.
 Wild Bill sent me to
deliver Tammany Hall's summons.
 You're to report to Eustace's
office immediately.
 Word is out. They want you
to replace Donovan.
 And they won't take no
for an answer.
 Do I look like
a ward boss to you?
 Kevin,
trust me on this,
 you turn them down,
 New York is not a place
you will ever live in peace.
 What're ya gonna do?
 How's Eva been?
 Sullivan's had us workin'
around the clock.
 We haven't had a night
in The Paradise since you left.
 Kevin,
this is serious!
 We may win a skirmish
against the organization,
 but no way
we win a war.
 I'm gonna hit Eva's
and have a drink
 while I consider my options.
 Join me when you can.
 If you need to scream,
you let it out,
 especially if the noise
helps you to keep breathing.
 Go on.
 Sara, I'm here.
 Doctor Freeman! Doctor...
 That's rosewater.
 Leah's been using compresses
to stay relaxed.
 The baby's breach.
 We've been at this
for 16 and a half hours.
 I've been too terrified
to let her push
 because I could still feel
the cervix.
 If she forces too early,
 the baby's neck and head
are in danger.
 That's exactly right.
 But I think she's ready now.
 And the baby's arms
seem to be in the right place.
 Feel here.
 You're doing fine, Leah.
 Matthew and I are gonna
see you through this.
 No, I'll take over now, hmm?
You wash up and rest.
 Matthew, I've been at this
for 16 and a half hours...
 Reason to stay,
not turn tail.
 Sara, you have guided this woman
and her child incredibly.
 Let the outcome
be my responsibility, hmm?
 Sara...
 Sometimes nature
does not cooperate.
 I'm beginning to think
that Kevin Corcoran
 does not take us seriously.
 Eva. Eva?!
 Eva?!
 Eva?!
