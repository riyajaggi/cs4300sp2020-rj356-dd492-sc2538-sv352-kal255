 Copper (2012â€“2013): Season 2, Episode 5 - A Morning Song - full transcript 
 Five Points falls into a state of panic as a community safe haven is seized by one of the deadliest men in New York City. With both coppers and civilians at his mercy, Detectives Kevin Corcoran and Andrew O'Brien, with Doctor Matthew Freeman and several coppers, race against time to restore peace to the Sixth Ward. As the coppers defend their home against an unrelenting foe, Francis Maguire sees an opportunity to settle a score with Corcoran.

 I can't do this anymore.
 You are dismissed,
corporal.
 I've got a new girl, Lola.
She's practically a virgin.
 The killer is Francis Maguire.
 I heard him admit
the murder meself.
 Please tell me
you didn't kill Phinbar.
 The forger's a true artist.
 Where are my plates,
O'Rourke?
 Them bastard cops
grabbed them,
 along with our man Maguire.
 First thing sunrise,
 We storm the precinct
and get back what's mine!
 Did I scare you
last night?
 Why would ya?
 I scare myself
sometimes.
 I get wild,
tip over,
 lose myself
in what I'm doing.
 I think
it's the gypsy in me.
 I have to tire myself out
to get back.
 Well...
 ...I needed
a little tired.
 You're shaving first thing
in the morning?
 Yeah. So?
 Didn't think
you were the type
 to get all washed up
before work.
 Only after a big drink.
 Helps me focus,
see if I'm steady.
 What's your real name?
 What do you mean?
 I've been around Eva's
long enough.
 None of you use
your Christian names.
 Who says
I'm a Christian?
 Fine. Victoria.
 Come on.
 Honestly?
Yeah.
 Rose.
 Oh, I'm not buying that.
 The absolute truth?
Gloria.
 You win.
Lola it is.
 Did you send my message?
 Sure I did.
 Said he'd be right down
 after your audience
with Pope Pious.
 Now shut your mouth
 before ya catch yourself
another beatin',
 ya cop killer,
all right?
 You aren't seein' anyone,
and you aren't going anywhere.
 You're gonna stay here
and fester!
 I don't know. Do I have to?
 Yes.
 Now, once more.
Are you ready?
 Mm-hmm. mm-hmm.
 Greenbacks!
Free money!
 Here you're rich. You're rich!
It's all yours, fellas!
 There's a pot of gold!
It's the end of your rainbow!
 Take it! And there!
 You'll never work again
in your life!
 What in the good hell?!
 Hands up!
 - Down, you coppers!
- Get back! Move!
 Get down! Kiss the floor,
you bastards!
 - Right!
- I said down!
 You move...
 Get down!
 ...You die!
 Get down, pig!
Pig, get down!
 Get down! Get down!
Get down!
 - Down! Now!
- That's it, you!
 Don't blink at me!
Don't look at me!
 Just stay still!
 Get down! Come on!
 Right. Stay where
you are. All o' ya!
 Good morning to all!
 Morning it is.
But good?
 Good is such a small
and aspiring word.
 Who the hell
do you think you are?!
 Shut up!
 Mister Philomen Keating,
preeminent malefactor,
 currently specializing
in custom-made currency.
 The counterfeiter.
 Incarnate.
 And I've heard much about you,
Captain Sullivan.
 Now, I know
at this early hour
 you are understaffed
and vulnerable.
 So let's play nice,
shall we?
 I want my printing plates,
and I want them now.
 Lola?
 Gloria, Rose...
 It was... It is...
for the best.
 ...for both of us.
 It's like Donovan said...
 Some things only get more broke
the more you try to fix 'em.
 If that ain't the truth.
 Thanks for the night.
 Where are my printing plates,
Captain Sullivan?
 Find my plates!
 Well...
 Why, hello.
 Such a beautiful couple.
 I want me plates!
 Please, we're only here
to report a theft.
 Oh...
 Someone has done you wrong?
 A frustrating feeling,
isn't it?
 Come here.
 Shh... it's okay.
 Stop!
 No!
 Jesus Christ!
 My plates?
 I don't know what
you're talking about!
 Bullshit!
 When I asked out there
your face fell.
 You knew exactly why I was here
and what I would do for them!
 I am in a hurry!
 So do not waste my time,
Captain!
 Trust me, you don't want to see
what I am capable of
 when a situation deteriorates!
 They're here,
right here!
 There's no need
for any more of this.
 That drawer there?
 No, I don't think there. no!
 Or there, or there...
 ...or there, or there!
 Take the guns!
Let's move!
 Search everywhere!
 The damn drawers are empty!
 - Any luck?!
- No!
 Shit! Keep checkin'!
Shut the blinds!
 Where the hell
are the goddamn things?!
 Nothin' but goddamn papers!
 Anything?!
 Not a damn thing!
Jam the door shut!
 Give it.
 All right, all right!
 Can I have my clothes now?
 What's with
the herd of folks out front?
 Earn your clothes.
 You do know how to fire
a pistol, don't ya?
 Now, now...
 Argh! God!
 Nice shootin',
ya bleedin' gabbey!
 Next time shut your eyes.
You might actually hit the man
 somewhere between his balls
and his brains!
 What the shit,
Seamus?!
 How does this copper
know your name?
 No, I can explain.
 Explain what?!
 We gave ya the 200 coins
for blowin' in Francis Maguire.
 And now y'gone and shot me!
Goddamn it!
 Mister O'Rourke,
 Tell me our search
has been successful!
 No, boss, not yet!
 What did you expect to achieve
 by governing an institution
such as this?
 Order? Justice?
 This is the only order
there is,
 and the only justice you get
in this world
 is the one you can afford.
 But if you take justice
into your own hands,
 you can create your own order.
 I've built an empire
from order.
 And I will not have it
taken away from me.
 Where are my blessed
plates, Captain?!
 Get Maguire!
 About damn time!
 Seamus,
what's with the birthday suit?
 O'Rourke.
 I didn't expect
to see you still standin'.
 Takes more than a beatin'
to keep me down.
 What in the hell?
 Corky, get over here now!
Corky!
 Andrew, what's going on?
 The Druids,
 they took over
the precinct.
 They got hostages.
 There were several
shots fired, but...
 But we don't know
if any...
 Oh, sweet Christ.
 Francis.
 Get the hell off the street!
 Go! Go! Go!
 Go! Go! Go! Move! Go!
 Goddamnit!
How many are there?!
 I think I saw half a dozen!
 Sounds like more than that!
 That's because they're in
a building full of guns,Andrew!
 Our guns.
 Cover! We need cover!
 ...and as many coppers
as you can find!
 Hold your fire there, lads!
 You're only making
a lotta racket!
 We need to save our bullets!
 Morning,
Mister Maguire.
 Where's wee Seamus?
 Seems our boy
was a turncoat.
 He's awaitin'
his sentence.
 A celestial circle of blue.
 A beautiful,
affecting sight.
 Oh, and here come the dregs
from the basement!
 Welcome! Welcome!
 The more the merrier
for this party!
 Over against the wall.
Come on!
 The philistine
who arrested you, is he here?
 Hell if I know.
 Now that I'm on
the other side,
 all coppers
look the same to me.
 Then let me ask you.
 Where are my goddamn plates?
 Hey.
 No one knows.
Fascinating.
 To my knowledge,
 it is customary
that when a man is arrested...
 ...the items found on his person
are confiscated as evidence.
 Yet my men have searched
every room,
 every drawer,
 every goddamn locker.
 And there is no evidence
of Mister Maguire's arrest.
 Allow me to be clear:
 I came here in search
of possessions
 that belong to me.
 I will not leave
 until I have
those possessions back.
 You people are commodities
to me;
 products that I will trade
and use as needed.
 And if someone doesn't tell me
where my possessions are,
 you are products
that I will dispose of
 at my leisure.
 Where are they?
 Here!
 - You all armed?!
- Aye! Aye!
 Any sign of Sullivan?
 No! Can we get in touch
with Donovan?
 He went north last night.
 You two!
 Take the alley outside
Schwartz's pawn shop now!
 Right away, sir!
Come on!
 Hey.
 I need you to take
the back door! Go! Now!
 Detective, last night--
 I don't give a damn
about last night!
 But I found Annie.
 I tried to bring her home,
to your home,
 but your wife, Ellen,
she wouldn't have her.
 And Annie said
she wanted to wait for you...
 ...here in the precinct.
 Hold your fire
until I say so!
 Hold your fire!
 Goddamn it!
I said save your bullets!
 Put him there!
 Put the captain there
with his men.
 I want to talk to
whoever's in charge in there!
 Stay down!
 You're gonna negotiate
with these assholes?!
 What other choice
do we got?
 I said I wanna talk!
Do you hear me?!
 I speak not to the unknown!
 Who calls for me?
 Detective Corcoran!
 What seems to be the problem,
detective?
 Son of a bitch
thinks he's a comedian.
 I'm assuming you're
not acting out of whim or caprice.
 So I'm curious,
what's drivin' ya?
 How can we help?
 Ah, yes,
what is the inspiration
 for such an act?
 That is your question
and it is a damn good one!
 The spirit behind the decision
to enter this building,
 Is it a divine spirit,
you may wonder?
 The truth?
 I cannot identify
between the omnipotent
 and the ambitions of man!
 Can you, sir?!
 Hello? Good sir?!
 Stand down!
Everyone stand down!
 What is it you want?
Money?
 Money?
 I have more money
than King Solomon.
 I want my printing plates,
Francis Maguire,
 and free passage
out of this city
 for me and my men.
 What printing plates?
 You know damn well.
 The plates your men stripped
from Maguire last night.
 What's he talking about?
 When we picked up Francis
 He was carrying
counterfeitin' plates.
 We processed them
like any evidence.
 My man here,
he was in on the arrest!
 He says they're in the locker!
 Do you suggest
I am mindless enough
 that I did not
look there?
 Wait, wait, wait, wait!
 Do you have any wounded
in there?
 It's a wee bit
of a mess, I'd say.
 Any...
 Any wounded children?
 No!
 Not yet.
 I'm still in a hopeful mood.
 Please don't hurt anyone else!
 We'll find those plates,
get you transport,
 whatever else you need,
but it'll take some time!
 Time.
 Time. Time.
 Money I can make,
but time...
 Until then,
can we get a doctor in there,
 take a look at the wounded?
 Are you still there?!
 Are you there?!
 Find my plates,
Detective!
 Your doctor will have
precisely 15 minutes,
 but I warn you,
if he's not a doctor,
 you'll need a mortician.
 Get Freeman!
 Yes, sir, Detective,
right away.
 I'll bury Maguire for bringing
this bullshit business
 into our precinct.
 Where the hell
are those plates?!
 Pray tell.
 Coppers at all entrances,
front and back.
 They got us surrounded.
 Well, we've got
the hostages.
 My chips are on the table.
 I've braved harsher fires
than this.
 Dressing and--
 The marine sponge and uh...
 Opium powder?
 Ah.
 Please.
 Will you be okay?
 Okay? No.
I'll worry myself sick.
 I promise,
I will--
 Don't say it.
Just go, do the job,
 and come home safe.
 I'll get the room
ready here
 in case we need to take care
of any wounded.
 All right.
 There are six men
as far as we know.
 Where they're stationed,
I, I can't tell ya.
 But I know the hostages
 are both coppers
and civilians.
 And Matthew...
 Annie's in there.
 They say they haven't hurt
any children, but--
 I'll look for her first,
Corky.
 If I had another option,
any other,
 I wouldn't ask you
to go in.
 The doctor's comin' in!
 Keep walkin'.
 Apologies,
can't be too cautious.
 Are you a real doctor,
medical doctor,
 or some kind of
African witch doctor
 with spells and such?
 A medical doctor,
yes.
 Pleased to see ya
as always,
 Doctor Freeman.
 Doctor Free-man.
Huh.
 Oh, you know what?
Forgot to mention one caveat.
 If you're not out of here
in exactly 15 minutes,
 beginning... now,
 I will kill you.
 Got it?!
 Easy. You're okay,
you're okay, hmm?
 For the time being
he is. But I...
 ...can't make any guarantees
in regards to his future.
 Am I gonna die?
 No, Captain.
 Huh.
 Put on the whole armor of God,
 that ye may be able to stand
against the wiles of the devil.
 For we wrestle not against
flesh and blood,
 but against principalities,
 against powers,
 against the rulers of darkness
of this world,
 against spiritual wickedness
in high places.
 Wherefore take unto you
the whole armor of God
 that ye may be able to withstand
in the evil day
 and having done all to stand.
 Stand therefore.
 Stand.
 Without surgery,
 Captain Sullivan
is sure to die and soon.
 With your permission,
 I'd like to have one
of the hostages
 help me carry
the wounded man out.
 Two for one?
 You are shrewder
than you look, doctor.
 And for a smoke,
 you've some pair of balls
on ya.
 You have achieved
the impossible.
 You have taken down
the strongest precinct
 in New York.
 And you have the power
to take lives.
 But you also have the power
to save lives.
 Allow me to help you
save this one man.
 Let's play a game
of democracy
 in the way our beloved
government declares it does!
 You get one vote.
The motion on the table:
 Do we allow the black doc
to remove Captain Sullivan
 from the premises?
 Come on now.
Vote yes,
 Captain Sullivan
goes to surgery.
 Vote no,
he remains here to die.
 But there's a catch.
 Isn't there always?
 A life for a life.
 Now, sir--
 Quiet, nigger.
 If you vote to release
Captain Sullivan,
 one of you will take his place
and die.
 And if you vote to retain
Captain Sullivan
 and watch his life
wither away,
 you stand a good chance
of living.
 Now hands up
for those who are willing
 to release the good captain!
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 For those of you
with your hands tied,
 say, "Me! Me! Me!"
 Such handsome selfishness.
 Not a single one of you cares
about Sullivan's life?
 This is too amusing.
 But I admit
I love the irony
 of an Irish police
captain's life
 in the hands
of a negro.
 So, go ahead.
 Get one of those useless coppers
from out there.
 You do understand,
 You've got less
than four minutes left.
 Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick, tick...
 I need a man to help me
carry out Captain Sullivan
 and get him to surgery
right now!
 I want assurances
 that the man coming inside
will not be harmed!
 Detective,
 I can assure you that your man
has three minutes!
 I need to see
what's going on in there.
 It's all right,
I'm comin' in.
 Get in here!
 What the hell?
Settle down!
 Move it! Get in there!
 How goes the search
for my goods?
 - Slowly.
- It's a shame.
 There's only two things
that should be done slowly,
 and one of them is pork,
roast pork.
 Why kill the innocent...
 ...for a few pieces
of missing steel?
 Innocent or no,
 there is and always has been
only one reason to kill:
 Money.
 Why didn't the Union allow
the Confederacy to secede?
 Money, cotton money.
 And what happened next?
Killing.
 Hundreds of thousands dead
because of Washington's
 ever-ambitious empire,
Detective!
 They institute
a federal currency
 ruining states' rights,
independent banks' rights,
 and only one party wins:
the federal government.
 So if they have the right
and the power to print money,
 then so do I.
 This is madness.
 Well, for some of us,
madness is the only place
 in which
to make our fortunes.
 Corcoran, please!
 The only reason
I haven't yet shot you
 is because I want to see
if you and this dark doctor
 can carry a grown man
out of here in...
 Twenty-two seconds.
 19, 18, 17, 16, 15,
 14, 13, 12, 11,
 ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
 five, four, three, two...
 Matthew, I didn't
see Annie in there.
 She's safe,
hiding in your office.
 They haven't found her, yet.
 You've got 'til
quarter past the hour
 to get me my plates,
 two carriages out in front,
a clear path to the docks,
 and an unguarded boat
waiting there!
 Otherwise the death toll
will rise quickly!
 They got two in the front,
four in the muster room.
 Of the hostages alive,
they got seven of our boys,
 eight civilians
and Annie.
 Which one of you's
the fastest?
 I won the Tammany
fourth of July race
 three years runnin'.
 There's a Norwegian
named Oma
 at Fatty's Saloon
on Mulberry.
 You'll recognize him.
 Say we need one large
piece of pie,
 and go grab me two steaks.
 You, go grab
the rest of our boys
 and bring 'em to me now! Go!
 All right,
you just rest now.
 It was bad.
Your face tells me that.
 I don't know why, Sara,
but there are days when...
 ...a shadow descends upon a place,
 a dark, bloody pall,
 same as on the battlefield,
same as at the precinct today.
 And, oh yes,
 one can fight it
with all his might,
 but it's almost
as if the shadow
 needs to beat
its own self down,
 eat its own self
'fore it fades away and...
 There are days this world
makes no sense to me...
 ...none at all.
 Which one of you can sing?
 What's your name?
 Felix the tenor, sir.
 Why is that?
 Because, sir, my name is Felix
and I sing tenor.
 Well, Felix,
 I want you to sing me
the saddest song you know.
 Dear thoughts are in my mind
 And my soul soars enchanted
 As I hear the sweet larks--
 From the Norwegian.
 Good. Set it down there.
 All right,
if he wants mayhem,
 let's give him mayhem.
 What the Jesus?
 They sent us beef!
 Holy shit!
 Let's go! Go! Go! Go!
 Tommy, hurry!
 Got him!
 Shoot!
 Police! Drop
your weapons! Stay where you are!
 Wait! Stop!
 Argh!
 Stay down!
 Everyone stay down!
 Cover the stairs!
 Run!
 Agh!
 Agh! Agh!
 Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!
 Shoot once more
and I'll kill the girl!
 Hold your fire!
That's an order!
 Hold fire!
 Please, please,
please, please...
 I want all copper
weapons on the floor!
 Try and hold onto
a second weapon...
 ...any other weapon,
I goddamn dare you!
 If one shot is fired,
she dies.
 Do what he says! Now!
 Agh! Agh! Agh!
 Grab 'em!
 It's you or the young lass,
Detective Corcoran.
 And I will take pleasure
in killing her.
 Please, Kevin! Please!
Please! Agh!
 Please, Kevin, please, no!
 You got me.
 Now let her go.
 Go on, child, go!
 I'm growing tired.
 So this is the last time
I'm gonna make this request.
 Ungh!
 Agh!
 I have no idea where
your plates are--
 It was simple!
 Hand over two pieces
of metal.
 But, no, you gotta be
the government man,
 the man with a badge.
 Well, now you die
for your sins.
 Wait!
 Mister Maguire,
What say you?
 Corcoran's the bastard
who sent me to swing.
 Would be a pleasure
to pay him back for it.
 Be my guest.
 Francis!
 Don't do this.
 Mind yourself,
Andrew.
 Been waiting a while for this,
Corky.
 And here's that I thought
I'd reach hell before you.
 But life's full of surprises,
isn't it?
 Slan go foill.
 Agh!
 You see, Mister Keating...
 A man can only climb so high...
 ...before his ambitions
become too much
 and he must be taken down.
 The Druids are dead.
 But as I said...
 ...life's full of surprises.
 You saved my life
when New York burnt.
 Now I saved yours.
 We're square.
 Detective?
 Yeah?
 Oh, I don't know,
it's just...
 ...guess I never thought something
like this could happen here.
 Neither did I, kid.
 But we got our home back.
 Why wasn't I informed?
 Captain Sullivan wasn't even
in the know.
 And thank the good Lord
for that negro doctor of yours,
 or else we would have lost
another fine man.
 Francis went in deep.
 He had to think like them,
act like them, smell like them.
 He had to become one of them.
 For chrissakes.
 We lost innocent civilians,
 and several
of our own men today!
 And what about Phinbar?
 I did not kill,
little Byrnes-
 Casualties!
 You're a soldier, Corcoran.
 You know losses come
for the greater good.
 I'm gonna tell you gentlemen
something
 that does not leave this room.
 These Howard Keating
was searching for.
 The Union Army
is counterfeiting money,
 Confederate money,
 and flooding the South
with the bills.
 A flood which is destroying
what little was left
 of their economy.
 In retaliation,
the rebs wanted to do the same.
 We could not afford
to let that happen here!
 When I mustered out,
the high command approached me,
 asked me to track down Keating,
 knowing full well he had been
hired by the Confederacy
 to strike New York.
 The assignment:
Put him out of business.
 So...
 ...money over lives,
is it?
 It's reality, Detective.
 The dirty little side
of the war
 that gains no headlines,
 earns no commendations.
 And in that skirmish,
 Francis Maguire
was a valiant soldier.
 He was in the precinct
the entire time,
 gun in hand,
 and did nothing
to stop Keating's slaughter!
 I was in holding
half the time!
 If I'd'a fired on 'em,
 it would have been
the death of me
 and the investigation!
 I need to know,
Francis...
 Who killed Phinbar?
 James O'Rourke.
 And today, Corky,
thanks to you,
 the murderin' bastard
got his.
 Lads, enough!
 Detective Maguire.
 Now look, I understand
some serious shit
 has gone down
between the two of ye.
 Moving forward,
 you two will work for me,
together...
 ...like it or not.
 To what's to be.
 Shake the man's hand,
Detective.
