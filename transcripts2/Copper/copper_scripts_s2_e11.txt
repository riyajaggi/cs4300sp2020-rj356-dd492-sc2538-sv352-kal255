 Copper (2012â€“2013): Season 2, Episode 11 - Good Heart and Willing Hand - full transcript 
 Looming devastation to Five Points forces Detective Kevin Corcoran to take drastic action against Tammany Hall. Injuries old and new push Doctor Matthew Freeman to his breaking point. As Elizabeth Morehouse spirals further into addiction, intervention comes from the unlikeliest of sources. Meanwhile, as Madame Eva Heissen's murder trial begins, outside forces work other avenues for her freedom.

 I'm sorry, Eva,
 you'll be prosecuted
for murder.
 We'll start
organizing your defense.
 About my shop window.
 Relax.
 The only qualifying
bid that remains
 is that of
General Brendan Donovan.
 General Donovan has
presented us with offers
 for each of the properties
we own in Five Points.
 Donovan is going to level
his own ward?
 You're chasing two stale cases,
Bartlett and Ramsey?
 Are you coverin'
for him? For Donovan?
 I got your one Teresa
Trembley in hiding,
 but tonight Donovan ordered me
to silence her.
 Teresa!
 Hey!
 What the hell's the matter
with you two?!
 Agh!
 Ungh! My god,
what are you doing?!
 Joe, you goddamn prick!
 Don't leave me here alone
with these animals!
 What do you want from me?
 Take whatever you want!
 You want money?
I got money!
 Take it!
Leave me be, please!
 One tiny crack on the head
 and this bastard's
already quivering.
 A shame he don't got
five or six of his pals here
 to help him out, huh?
 The sixth precinct don't
take kindly to mobs
 dispensing whatever it is
they consider "justice."
 But--!
 I don't care
if you're a negro,
 a chinaman,
or an asshole like you,
 the only beatings allowed
in this neighborhood
 are comin' from our fists,
understand?
 Yeah.
 You better.
 Otherwise, we'll come back here
each and every week
 to remind you
of this little lesson.
 Matthew?
 Come to bed.
It's late.
 Ah, just a little
while longer.
 Matthew, you haven't been
getting near enough sleep
 these past few days.
 I know, and I can,
I will,
 but right now I'm close
to finding something
 that could treat
this unknown bacteria.
 Couldn't it wait
until morning?
 I said I'll come to bed
when I am finished!
 Goodnight!
 How can a man
take the life of a young girl,
 discard her body
like a piece of trash?
 I...
 I couldn't say,
Mister Trembley,
 but we're doin' everything
we can to find her killer.
 You said that
she came to you.
 You were supposed
to protect her.
 You're just as responsible
for her death
 as the monster
who did the deed.
 I'm sorry, I...
I didn't mean to--
 Leave us in peace!
 I'd tell you and the rest
of the godless savages
 inhabiting this city
to go to hell,
 but you're already there.
 She was a beautiful girl.
 I grieve for your loss.
 All right,
bring in the jury.
 Sheisse.
 Oh, excuse me.
 - Hey there.
- Oh, hello, uh, detective.
 Corcoran.
 It's Billy, ain't it?
Donovan's new clerk.
 Yes, sir,
I'm on my way in now.
 Oh! I'm headin'
there myself. I'll walk with ya.
 Love to hear how the general's
been treating you.
 I'm, uh, runnin' late, actually.
 It's a gorgeous day out, well...
 ...a few extra minutes
won't kill ya.
 Is there any particular reason
 you're standing in the middle
of my office, Detective?
 Yeah, captain had a message
for ya.
 Uh...
 New kid wasn't here.
 Figured I'd just leave it
on your desk.
 I appreciate
your attentiveness.
 Mornin', General.
 Your concerns are noted, father.
 Yet here you persist.
 Thus the beauty of our
"business" relationship.
 You provide me with analysis,
 which I then choose
to ignore or heed.
 You have yet to heed
any of my suggestions.
 If you are dissatisfied,
 feel free to head off
and farm greener pastures.
 I've made my decision.
 You're a fool, Robert!
 Perhaps.
 But displacing thousands
of immigrants
 is no longer a business
I hold interest in.
 Our properties
will not be sold
 to aid Donovan
and his aqueduct.
 The city will then simply
take our properties
 through eminent domain,
 than our current offer!
 You have always lamented
my lack of principles, father.
 Take comfort knowing
that I finally found some.
 Not your lack of principles,
Robert,
 your lack of practicality.
 I need it set up
in the music room, James.
 Yes, ma'am, I'll see to it.
 You're not leaving already?!
 I've hardly seen you
all morning.
 Then you probably
shouldn't sleep the day away, dear.
 I have wonderful plans for us.
 I'm to be your muse.
 As compelling as that
sounds, I have business to attend to.
 Oh business, business.
So much time for work,
 so little time for play...
 ...least of all your wife.
 Who knows,
 you may even be interested
in my work,
 crusading to aid
the downtrodden,
 a cause for which you used
to care a great deal.
 Fortunately, you've made it
quite clear in the past
 that my interest in your work
is not welcome.
 I'll be back later.
 Try and stay
conscious today.
 Brian, bloody
Christ Almighty, knock it off!
 Detective!
 So you think you can just
come and go as you please?
 Don't know what you mean,
Captain.
 Your attendance has been
sparse this past week.
 So you're either
shirking your duty
 or working a case
off-book.
 Neither, sir.
 I know what
you've been up to, Corcoran.
 Those yardsticks
who laid a beating
 on your doctor friend?
 I'm told that you decided
to send a message to them.
 Right.
 I just felt I should remind them
of their place,
 who's really in charge here.
 Yes, it's an important
lesson to remember.
 Corcoran.
 Double the weekly taxes
on their store
 while you're at it.
 I can't abide vigilantes
roaming my streets!
 Donovan's clerk Billy
doesn't know anything.
 You find something of interest
in the office?
 A wall safe.
 Donovan came in before I could
get a good look at it though.
 Did he make you?
 Nah, I don't think so.
 I was just tellin' Andrew
about the Trembleys.
 Mother and father weren't
very keen on talkin'.
 Pretty torn up.
 I suppose the doctors
didn't give you
 anythin' else to go by?
 Nah, just what we knew:
 Poor girl was strangled,
her body dumped.
 And at a renderin'
plant, for chrissake.
 I can't believe
he just walks in here,
 struttin' like he ain't got
a care in the world.
 And he'll keep struttin'
 unless we can find
physical evidence
 tying him to the crimes.
 Donovan ordered Lansing
and Teresa killed.
 I heard him give the order
with my own ears.
 Whose words
are gonna be believed?
 A murderous,
crooked cop,
 or a devoted public servant,
hero of the ward?
 You come forward,
it won't be Donovan's ass
 they throw in the tombs.
 You really wanna go back there?
 We need something
concrete to bring Donovan down.
 See if Freeman will take a look
at Teresa's body.
 Maybe he'll uncover
some evidence we missed.
 Us? What about you?
 I'm gonna swing down
to the courthouse.
 I ain't gonna lose another name
to Donovan's ledger.
 Alderman, please.
 The passion is appreciated,
 but we have delayed long enough!
 A few more days.
Give me until Friday.
 I'm sorry.
The vote will happen tonight.
 The public's health
is not something--
 If and when the project
is awarded to Mister Donovan,
 you can take your concerns
directly to him.
 This court is in recess.
 I missed you
in my cheering section.
 I'm working other
avenues outside the courtroom.
 How's the trial going?
 Oh, it's a gas.
 The judge is having me over
for tea this weekend.
 It's going like
I expected,
 a room full of stodgy men
 detailing what I did wrong
in my life.
 At least you have
a good lawyer.
 Pfft! I'd rather have
my business back.
 Christ himself
couldn't sway these people.
 Don't worry.
I'll figure this out.
 Sure you will.
 I'm not gonna
lose anyone else.
 One way or another,
 you and I are gonna walk
outta these doors,
 I swear.
 Lord help the man that gets
in your way, copper.
 Do me a favor...
send Richie over, will ya?
 I got an errand for him.
 Grab your bag, Freeman,
time to work some magic.
 Excuse me,
gentlemen?
 We got a dead body
needs lookin' at.
 Sorry, but I'm in the
middle of an experiment.
 Then ya can experiment later.
 No.
 What's that?
 I said no.
 You'll have to find
someone else!
 Corky said he needed ya
to look at a body for us.
 And I often help him
when I choose to do so.
 But right now I'm in the middle
of something more important.
 Ah, what then,
you want a coupla bucks?
 You'll leave me alone.
 How difficult is that
for you to understand?
 Jesus,
no need to be a prick.
 Say that again.
 Easy now.
Francis didn't mean nothin' by it.
 We just figured,
 after we went outta our way
to help with that shopkeeper--
 I didn't ask you to do that.
 No. Even so--
 And don't pretend
as if you did it
 outta the kindness
of your heart!
 When was the last time you,
any of you,
 helped a black man
who'd been attacked?!
 One who wasn't friends
with Kevin Corcoran?
 I don't owe either of you,
or Kevin for that matter,
 a goddamn thing!
 Solve your own case
for a change.
 You know,
you got some nerve.
 Hmm?
 Come on, Andrew.
 Let's go.
 Agghhhh!
 Ten cents a quart!
 Oh, I didn't leave.
Uh, I...
 So why would a
wealthy fellow buy a business
 only to keep the place closed?
 I don't know.
What do you want with me?!
 I need you to tell me
 what you're really up to
with Donovan.
 Look, if I say anything,
 I am liable to end up
a dead man!
 If you don't say anything,
 death ain't likely,
but assured.
 All right, all right,
all right!
 Look, I'm not some
big to-do.
 Yeah, I don't have
any real money.
 I'm just a face,
a name that they put on paper,
 a front for
the real property owners
 who need to keep their name
out of public record.
 Donovan pays you
for this service?
 Him and a few others.
 So Donovan bought
The Paradise?
 No, he arranged it
for someone else.
 Then who secretly
owns Eva's?
 Some uptown millionaires.
 The Morehouse family.
 Mmm... The light.
 You have the most exquisite
skin, dear,
 like mottled alabaster.
 Thank you, ma'am.
 If possible,
could I get up now?
 No, no, no, no,
not quite yet.
 Just a little bit longer.
 Inspiration hath no clock.
 Come over here
for a moment, Elizabeth,
 I wish to show you something.
 What is it?
 Quite the eye-opener.
 Hmm...Oops!
 You've piqued my interest.
 In here.
 I don't see anything.
 The time has come
to clean you up, dear!
 How dare--!
 No!
 How dare you?!
 You got a visitor.
 He say what he wants?
 Nah. Just that
it was important.
 Anything from Freeman?
 He turned us down.
 I think he's dealin'
with his own problems.
 Join the club.
 Yeah.
 I take it this ain't
a social visit?
 Serious matters,
I'm afraid.
 Involving Donovan?
 How prescient, Corky.
 Major, I ain't interested in anything
 you and Donovan have to say.
 I'm done being manipulated
by rich assholes
 who take what don't
belong to 'em.
 I'm afraid you've lost me.
 You ever gonna tell me
about your family
 purchasing buildings
in Five Points?
 It's true, we have,
for quite some time.
 And then you swept in
and snatched up Eva's
 when she was vulnerable.
 Technically, father bought it
at Donovan's suggestion.
 Then why didn't
you stop them?
 Because I didn't know
about Eva's myself
 until I went through
some of father's files.
 Truthfully, Corky,
 The Paradise is the least
of your worries.
 Donovan has grand plans
to build the new aqueduct
 for the city.
 You, your friends,
your neighbors,
 this building,
are in the way.
 If the plans go through,
 Eva's and half of Five Points
will be razed!
 So Donovan turns
on his own people.
 Power and money
are great motivators.
 The construction contract alone
is a windfall.
 Add to that,
any deals he's cut...
 Like deals with
property owners,
 hiding their purchases
with other names.
 Projects like these
take a lot of land,
 valuable land.
 I've done my best
to delay the process, Corky,
 but at this point,
Donovan has the votes.
 The board meets tonight.
 That's why
he's so desperate.
 Sorry I couldn't
do more.
 I've exhausted my options.
 I haven't.
 You think you could stop
by the city clerk,
 see if you can
pick anything up?
 Of course.
 This woman is
a simple business owner.
 We do not deny that she stabbed
Mister Ramsey in the eye...
 But like most women
in her condition,
 she was reacting
purely from instinct...
 Defending not only
her business,
 but her womb!
 Her child!
 - Are you hurt?
- No, just an accident.
 Matthew.
 You can't keep going
on like this.
 Like what?
 Like this.
 You're boiling
from within.
 - I'm tired.
- You haven't slept.
 No, I'm tired!
 Of the world,
the people in it,
 their existence,
their ignorance.
 It courses through my bones
like an electrical charge.
 Which you can
no longer control.
 I don't think I have
the strength to tolerate,
 to excuse,
to turn the other cheek.
 Then don't!
 Your grievances are real,
Matthew.
 You were attacked!
 I've been beaten before.
 When you were a slave,
 when you couldn't
fight back.
 But now you have the freedom
to confront your attacker
 and leaving it unresolved
is gnawing at you.
 Confront him...
 Beat him or embrace
him, that's up to you,
 but don't allow this pain
to fester in your chest.
 I never had the opportunity
to face the men
 who killed my brothers.
 Don't let this one act
poison you
 towards the rest of life.
 Call on Mister Flouton
personally
 to obtain the papers.
 That lazy welshman
has a penchant
 for hiding in his office
all day,
 avoiding actual work.
 Yes, sir.
 Kevin.
 Donovan.
 It's been a long while
since you've come by for a chat.
 Everything all right?
 Well, busy days.
Been to see Eva?
 Busy days as well.
 Not that I'd be
of much assistance
 with her fate
in the jury's hands.
 Can I help you
with anything?
 Teresa Trembley's
still alive.
 Well...
 Not in body,
but her secrets.
 Poor girl.
 Strangled by a man
 who was clearly
on the edge of sanity.
 I assume you haven't found
a culprit yet, though?
 No...
but I'm gettin' close,
 and I will not rest
until I catch
 the sick bastard
that killed her.
 Kevin Corcoran...
ever tenacious
 even in the face
of overwhelming odds.
 I'll be sure to let
you know if I make any progress, sir.
 See that you do, detective,
see that you do.
 Hee-ya!
 May I help you with something, sir?
 Yes, I need to see
the property records
 listed for a Mister John Sutton.
 Which ones
were you interested in?
 All of them.
 Ten dollars for each
one you find.
 Yes, sir. Right away.
 While Robert has
disappointed me in numerous ways,
 I must claim my own failures.
 I cannot stand by
while another woman my son loves
 addles herself
to an early grave.
 I am stronger than you think.
 His mother once said
much the same.
 Continue down this path,
Elizabeth,
 and he will,
much like I did,
 simply harden
his heart.
 I'm sure you've felt
the distance growing.
 Robert seems to forget
that he's the one
 that put me on this path.
 I do not believe that
any man has ever forced you
 to do anything
you chose not to.
 Do not shirk your responsibility
in this situation, Elizabeth.
 Surely your father
taught you better than that.
 You have no idea
 what kind of a man
my father was!
 I know the coal mines
of Lancashire are a world away
 from the parlors
of Manhattan.
 I know the cunning needed
 to erase the tragedies
of one's past
 and forge a new life
from the ashes.
 How long have you known?
 Long enough.
But understand me, Elizabeth,
 I do not care why you choose
to cloud yourself
 with these substances,
 be it from the past,
 a disillusionment
with the present,
 or a general weakness
of character.
 I simply want it
to stop.
 Robert will be touched
by your concern.
 Robert will never know
we've spoken.
 You will either
clean yourself up
 or you will leave.
 Leave?
 A life can be arranged
for you in California.
 Reinvent yourself
yet again.
 I'm told that strong-willed,
opiate-loving women
 are in great demand
out there.
 Norbert.
 Thank you.
 Donovan.
 It would appear that
we have a fly in the ointment.
 Seem to be
having quite a few of those lately.
 And you seem to forget
 that you are paid
to facilitate my desires,
 not comment on them.
 Of course, General.
 Come here.
 Off with ye.
 Excuse me.
 Are the rest running late?
 We're scheduled to hold a vote
here this evening, are we not?
 The meeting's been cancelled, sir.
 What? Why the hell
was I not informed?!
 Where's Alderman Stonington?!
 That's the reason
it was cancelled.
 Mister Stonington was picked up
by police detectives
 an hour ago.
 And you are certain
it was Donovan who sent you?
 Yes, sir, Mister Stonington.
 Like I said,
 somethin' about a possible,
uh, threat on yer life.
 - Uh-huh.
- It's probably nothin',
 but, uh, after what happened
with Alderman Bartlett,
 General Donovan figured
it'd be best you stay here,
 under our protection.
 Of course.
 You got somewhere
I could spit?
 It seems Mister Sutton
"owns" quite a bit of property
 along the aqueduct route.
 Donovan and his friends
have been busy.
 Are you certain
you don't want me involved
 in the rest
of the operation?
 Well, thanks, Major,
but...
 It'll be better
if I handle this my way.
 Agh!
 Guess ya didn't hear...
Corky don't live here no more.
 Lucky for you,
no one else has moved in,
 so we'll have plenty of privacy
to talk.
 Spring water.
 Never had a taste
for the stuff myself.
 Perhaps getting married
so quickly was a mistake.
 I know trust broken
 can sometimes take time
to repair, but...
 I felt embraced one moment
and abandoned the next.
 That was never
my intention.
 Will there ever be a time
 when both of us
will simply be happy
 with one another?
 I don't know why I excuse
the same behaviors in myself
 that I scold you for.
 I...
 I am the last person
who should be casting stones.
 If we're to continue,
Robert,
 I need you,
unconditionally,
 no matter how we choose
to move forth,
 sober or otherwise.
 Aggghhhhhh!
 Just tell us
what we wanna hear.
 Ah, tare an'ouns.
He's a tough wee thing.
 The Bartlett murders,
Lansing, Teresa Trembley.
 Probably had you finish off
Jack Ramsey, too.
 And you know this how?
 'Cause this lying,
sack-of-shit cyclops
 told you so?
 Aggghhhhhhh!
 Just give us Donovan
 and I'll make sure
you're taken care of.
 You really are as stupid as he says.
 The man's untouchable.
 You are nothing,
an inconvenience to Donovan.
 You're shit on his shoe.
 Yet he sent you here
to clean me off,
 so what does that make you?
 Charge me with
whatever you want, assholes.
 It wont matter. I'll be back
on the street in an hour.
 Who said anything
about charging you?
 I was just askin'
a few questions.
 The important thing to remember
is that your own actions
 led to the predicament
that you're in.
 I'll kill you,
I swear to God!
 Oh, better men than you
have tried, boyo.
 No!
Aggghhhhhhh!
 Well, if it ain't
the most popular negro
 in New York City.
 Unless that...
that's not the right term?
 It's hard to keep up with
whatever it is you zip coons
 want to be called these days.
 I have no interest in you
calling me at all.
 Did you come here
to gloat?
 I came to settle this business
between us.
 Yeah, sure.
 After you sent
your police friends around
 to fight for ya first.
 I don't recall you showing
up on my doorstep by yourself.
 Well, ya win, boy.
 Got no interest
in goin' up against
 the entire Metropolitan Police.
 Is that all?
 Or have you come
for your pound of flesh as well?
 I've given that thought
consideration.
 Well, I'm here,
ripe for the pickin'.
 What's stoppin' ya?
 Seems like that's
the only way men like you learn,
 through bloodshed.
 Don't act like yer above me.
 You may hide underneath
that fancy talk
 and those...
those dandy clothes,
 but I seen it...
that savage look in your eye.
 You ain't nothin'
but an animal.
 You're right,
I am an animal.
 As are you.
We all are.
 Speak for yourself.
 And like most animals
we are filled with base desires:
 hunger, lust, aggression,
violence,
 dominance.
 I've wrestled with
the primal nature inside of me,
 not wanting to validate
others' fears.
 I ain't afraid of you, boy.
 Oh, you are...
 ...and you should be.
 Because I've suffered
the ignominy of men like you
 every day of my life,
 and I have accepted
insult and injury
 all with the hope that one day
I would be seen as equal.
 But I've realized
that I am not your equal.
 You're goddamn right
you're not.
 I'm smarter than you,
and I am stronger than you,
 and I am through
concerning myself
 with the growls of simpleminded,
mangy little dogs.
 Goldenseal salve.
 Put it on your wound
to prevent infection.
 Or don't...
 and let it rot.
 I honestly couldn't
give a shit.
 Billy,
I need your help locating my--
 I know you love
tellin' stories, so...
 Let me share one,
 about a wise man
with grand plans for his city.
 Plans that,
as things progressed,
 he chose to see through
at any cost:
 theft, deception, murder.
 Murder, you say?
 Oh yes.
 An Alderman and his son,
 a competitor,
an innocent girl.
 The wise man justified
his actions...
 ...both to himself and others,
as part of the greater good.
 Perhaps he had a point.
 The wise man was a hypocrite.
 He didn't care about
his fellow citizens.
 He just...
well, hell,
 he'd rather throw them out
into the street,
 take their homes,
 all for the promise of a...
a little money.
 Oh, it was more than just
a little money, Kevin,
 but I shouldn't expect you
to understand.
 It's not in your nature.
 It's my own fault,
really,
 choosing to overestimate,
 see my young self in you.
 But you,
Kevin Corcoran,
 refuse to see the world
as it really is.
 Maybe.
 Maybe not.
 So what?
 Is this the part
where you throw me in shackles?
 In my world, yes.
 In your world,
 without any real evidence,
reliable witnesses...
 This?
It's all circumstantial.
 I'd never be able
to keep you in jail.
 How fortunate for me.
 Which means this
is usually the point
 where I put a bullet
in your brain
 and be done with it.
 That would be decidedly
unfortunate.
 But you're always goin' on
about how I should use my brain.
 Think less with my fists.
 So...
I'm here to cut a deal.
 You, compromising?
I'm shocked.
 More of a wager, actually.
 Open it.
 Five pulls
of the trigger.
 One bullet.
 One of us lives.
 One of us dies.
 That's not exactly what I meant
by using your head.
 I'm willing to put my life
on the line...
 ...for Five Points.
 Then you're a fool,
for I am not.
 Pick one.
Go on.
 You see...
 There are people in this city
worth saving,
 good people,
 and I'm tired of men
like you using 'em,
 discarding them without
a second thought.
 You're insane.
 Probably.
 I've been at war,
in riots...
 I'm not afraid to die.
 Question is...
 Are you?
 For what reason would I agree
to such madness?
 Because if you don't
I'll kill you right now.
 The only way you're gonna
leave this room alive
 is by picking up
one of these guns.
 Do you honestly believe
that you'll get away with this?
 Well, I have before.
 Even if I don't,
 what more do I have
left to lose?
 Your turn.
 Oh, come on, Donovan!
 I'm giving you
a sportin' chance.
 Three outta four.
 Surely you can use
your vaunted intellect
 to outsmart me,
 A lowly copper.
 Mmm...
 That wasn't so bad,
was it?
 You speak of doing right
for your fellow man,
 but it's not justice
that drives you,
 Kevin Corcoran.
 - Is that so?
- No.
 Justice is convicting me
in court,
 not through some sick game.
 Justice is having faith
in the system! The Law!
 You and your friends
have broken the system.
 So now we're forced to follow
your own personal code then?
 Is that it?
 It's better than
what we've been given.
 Oh, really?
 Who says your code is better
than mine or anyone else's?
 What gives you the right?
 The gun in my hand.
 Ah-ha!
 And now we arrive
at your true motivation...
 ...pain and death!
 You cloak your unquenchable
instinct for violence
 in the trappings of duty,
 oh, but, Kevin Corcoran,
 misery befalls anyone
in your orbit.
 No wonder your wife sought
any avenue
 to escape your touch.
 Where's that code of honor now?
 Two left.
 Almost over.
 But it's already over,
isn't it?
 Really, hmm?
You've rigged the game.
 What makes you say that?
 Whichever gun is loaded...
if one of them is loaded,
 I lose.
 I pick up the one
with the bullet,
 I shoot myself in the head.
 I pick up the empty gun,
and you're left with the one,
 and honor or no,
 I do not believe you will
willingly take your own life.
 No?
 Mmm,
you'll shoot me instead.
 That doesn't leave you
with many options, does it?
 Just one.
 Or...
 We call it a draw,
 on the condition that
you confess for your crimes
 and plead guilty.
 Perhaps you're more clever
than I gave you credit for,
 but the day I kowtow
 to a righteous little shit
like you
 will be my last.
 You're more like me
than you know,
 Kevin Corcoran.
 Mo chara...
 ...mo namhaid.
