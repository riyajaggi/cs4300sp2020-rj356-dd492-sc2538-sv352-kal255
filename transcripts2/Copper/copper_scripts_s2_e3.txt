 They captured Kennedy.
 I intend to ensure
that you hang!
 Do you intend
to tell the authorities
 of my involvement?
 Well, that depends.
 What they done to my brothers,
 I can't find the strength
to move past the memory.
 The druids,
they don't mess around.
 A gun, a knife,
 they're just tools
to get a job done.
 Two dead, five missing.
All from Five Points.
 How about a drink?
 I can't have a repeat killer
haunting my streets.
 Paper, get your paper!
 Oh, this one's a good one.
 Paper!
 Oh!
 God dammit, Doman!
 For god sakes stop!
 Arg!
 Mister Doman,
ain't it?
 Imagine runnin' into you
this fine mornin'?
 That's the second time
 you've tried to hoop it on me,
Doman!
 We're gonna have a chat
about those six missin' boys
 and the drugs we found
in your pocket!
 Oh no, no, no, no, detective.
 That, that was medicine
in my pocket.
 Legal medicine.
I got piles.
 Then what are you doin'
 putting medicine
in another man's drink?
 Oh, did I? Musta
thought the mug was my own.
 A crowded bar,
honest mistake.
 Nothing honest about it,
you toad.
 Ungh!
 Opinions aside, Detective,
 you fellas got no evidence
to prove otherwise.
 Ungh!
 Let's give him
some time to rethink.
 Put him in "the suite."
 - Really?
- Yeah.
 No... no... no...
 No! No!
 Please!
 Please... please...
 Please, stop! Stop! Stop!
 Agghhhh!
Get me outta here!
 Get me out of here!
Please!
 I'm finished.
 James, have you
seen my betrothed this morning?
 Missus
Haverford was up and left early, sir.
 Volunteering for
the ladies Christian Union,
 I believe.
 On our wedding day.
 Remarkable woman.
simply remarkable.
 You got somethin' for me?
 You see that my reply's
delivered in a timely manner.
 Will there be
anything else?
 You've told
your sweet Robert
 the truth of your
involvement with us?
 You know,
dishonesty and secrets
 are the death
of far too many a marriage.
 You need only consider
your previous one.
 Congratulations
on your weddin' day,
 Missus Haverford!
 I wish you nothin' but great
and perpetual happiness!
 A bit smaller, Annie.
 I know. I'm not finished yet.
 Morning, Kevin.
 Didn't hear you
come home last night.
 Workin' a case.
 Should I fix you
some breakfast?
 No. No. I just
came by to grab somethin'.
 But you'll be home in time
for the wedding?
 Yeah, of course.
 Major's sending a carriage
to pick us up.
 You are the
best man, after all.
 There's a...
 There's a ceili
at Callahan's tonight.
 I was thinkin'
we could go by afterwards,
 make a nice evening
of it?
 Just like
our first date.
 You mean the night when,
during the haymakers jig,
 you tripped over
old Missus Flynn
 'cause you were too busy
gawking at me?
 Got me a second date,
if I recall.
 Do you want
these in the kitchen, doc?
 - Yes, sir.
- Okay.
 Never imagined we'd
be seeing this old place again.
 Are you sure
you're all right?
 Fine.
 It's time we made
some new memories here.
 Please, Christ,
let me outta here!
 I thought you weren't
sayin' another word?
 I'm gonna give the two of you
some privacy.
 No, no, no, no,
please, please, stop!
 I'll tell you anything
you wanna know!
 But I didn't kill anybody!
 I was just doin' my job!
I swear!
 I work for the government!
 Bullshit!
 No, no!
 No, I'm tellin' the truth!
 I recruit soldiers
for the Union Army!
 Please!
Now get me outta here!
 Amigone funeral parlor's set up.
 They'll take twice as much
next week.
 Criminy, Francis.
 O'Rourke's gonna be
right pleased to hear that.
 Speakin' of which,
 I'd be happy to deliver
the news myself.
 Ain't properly had the chance
to meet the man yet.
 Ah, I'm not supposed to--
 Ah, c'mon now, Seamus.
 I been doin' good work
for the druids, ain't I?
 Sure.
 So what's the harm
in introducing me to O'Rourke?
 Especially coming from you,
one of his favorite boys.
 That's a good point.
 A word from me
would mean a lot.
 Ah, then the matter's
settled.
 Ah, yer a fine man,
Mr. Walsh,
 no matter what
your brother-in-law says.
 You have to see this!
He stinks all the way up here!
 - Really?
- Here.
 Stop! Stop! I'm freezing!
 I'm what some call
a bounty broker.
 For each soldier we sign up,
we get paid.
 Usually I have no problem
talkin' them into joining:
 A little whiskey,
a few tales of glory...
 They'd be all fired up
for Uncle Sam...
 and a paycheck.
 War drags on, huh?
 Word of the slaughter trickles
up North, doesn't it?
 Ain't as appealing,
 once you see men returnin' home
missin' their arms and legs.
 So you started
drugging 'em?
 Oh, I prefer
"loosening their inhibitions."
 Well, let's call it
kidnapping.
 Hit him again.
 That's what you're
doing, ain't it, pimp? Huh?
 Is that what it is?!
You stink!
 Hit him again! Go!
 You're shanghaiing these boys
and shipping them off
 to wake up in the middle
of some goddamn field!
 You gotta understand.
There's quotas to fill.
 If we don't procure the men,
some other broker will.
 Again.
 So how did the McGrath boy
end up dead?
 Oh no, no, no!
That was my partner.
 Calls himself
"John Smith."
 He tipped me off
to the brothers,
 said they'd make
"solid recruits."
 And while the two of us
 would normally work a pair
like them together,
 he went off and hired some goon
to take his spot!
 What sort of goon?
 Big, Bavarian fella
named Brubacher!
 I never met him before.
I never seen him since.
 You're sayin'
he killed John McGrath?
 We bought the boys a round,
 put a few drops
in their rag water,
 helped 'em
outta the bar.
 Then one of the brothers
starts struggling,
 and my sauerkraut-eating pal
goes berserk,
 starts beating the breath
outta the poor kid!
 Why didn't you
just stop him?
 He was pure muscle
and hardtack!
 I wasn't about to...
get my head caved in,
 so I... I took off.
 I told my partner
I'd stick to solo work.
 Where's this partner
of yours?
 And where are the rest
of those missin' boys?
 I don't know.
I don't know.
 - Again.
- No, no!
 - We need more men.
- For what reason?
 You've already got the suspect
in custody.
 He works with a partner.
Goes by "John Smith."
 We're guessin'
that ain't his given name.
 Doman snatches the recruits,
then hands them over to smith,
 who delivers the boys
to the union,
 and today's delivery day.
 According to Doman.
 When is this delivery?
 Claims he doesn't know.
 And where are the boys now?
 Not sure.
 Only location Doman met Smith,
aside from taverns,
 was an office
off Delancey.
 So, you expect me
to reassign my men
 based off the claims
of a crook
 who offers no proof
in return?
 No, I expect you to do it
based on my judgment, sir.
 Request denied.
 I've just sent twenty men
over to the eighth
 to help put down
a donnybrook.
 Besides, if this so-called
partner exists,
 I feel certain
my most capable detectives,
 Lord Corcoran,
and Duke McSavage,
 will turn up actual evidence
in proving it.
 Unless there's something more
important on today's agenda,
 Your Highnessness?
 Good. Then I suggest
you move your asses
 and get your jobs done,
gentlemen.
 Can I get the crystal
vases here with the cream roses?
 And we need to replace
all of these candles on both.
 Yes, ma'am.
 I have a confession to make.
 A confession?
 Yes. This morning I wondered
if you had finally ran off,
 realizing the mistake
in agreeing to this marriage.
 The silver's being loaded
into the carriage as we speak.
 Pity.
 Then I should take one last look
to remember you by.
 But on the off chance
you do decide to stay,
 any final words
before we take the plunge?
 Words are inefficient,
dear Robert.
 No signal for another train
 No further down the line
 No, sinner,
you are truly lost
 If for once you're left behind
 Get on board, get on board,
get on board
 Matthew...
 Don't just stand there
smilin' like a Sunday drunk.
 There is plenty
to do today.
 Well, I best just get
right to work then.
 Mm-hmm.
 Miss Heissen,
what a nice surprise.
 Thought I would welcome
you folks
 back to the neighborhood.
 Traditional pastries
from my homeland,
 along with a bottle
of Kohler & Frohling wine
 from California.
 Well, that's very thoughtful
of you.
 After the hospitality
you showed me,
 this is the least
I can do.
 This is John Smith's place,
 but I don't what's here
that'll tell you anything.
 Well, his real
name for instance.
 Long as I got paid,
didn't matter to me.
 You're telling me you never
picked up on something?
 Anything?
 Overheard a name,
a number...
 Because if that's really
the case...
 Then we got no more use for ya.
 I'd never killed a man
until the war.
 The first one,
that was...
 That was hard.
 Harder on him,
of course.
 After the first dozen,
killin' came easy.
 Top shelf on the left,
I mean, there's a file of his.
 I used to sneak peeks at it
from time to time,
 make sure I was gettin'
my fair share.
 Invoices, bills...
 Anything useful?
 Maybe.
 Name of U.S. Army
recruiting officer
 Sergeant Major Atticus Reid.
 Smith's contact?
 Could be.
I'll pay him a visit.
 You stay here,
 keep lookin' for something
that'll help us find Smith.
 You sure you
got time for that?
 I could go
to the recruiter myself.
 You gotta get
to that wedding.
 I've got more time
than those boys have.
 Besides, I'm hoping
my past service
 will help convince
this sergeant major
 to cooperate.
 You enter
at your own risk.
 Uh, this week's
take, Mister O'Rourke...
 and, uh, this here is, uh
 Francis Maguire.
 Yeah. He's been doing
such a good job for us,
 I thought,
well...
 Thank you,
Seamus.
 Of course.
 That means
you may leave.
 So you're the one-eyed
detective.
 I ain't a detective
no more.
 You still got the bad eye,
though.
 Sit down.
 Now why would you have
poor wee Seamus
 bring you down here,
Detective?
 I wanted to express
my appreciation to you,
 for givin' me
some work.
 I give you shite work,
 which can be done by an idiot
with half a brain.
 Seamus, for example.
 Are you happy with shite work,
Detective?
 Think I could be more than
just some delivery boy,
 an asset.
 A few years back,
me cousin got pinched
 liftin' goods
from Joe Hill's grocery.
 Did I arrest him?
 You shot him
in the ass.
 Ah, my cousin's
a prick.
 I'm sure he deserved
to bleed.
 I wanna know what you're really
offering, Detective.
 A man with no options
will do anything to survive.
 I'm yours.
Gimme more responsibility.
 A generous offer,
but also problematic.
 Even with your supposed
fall from grace,
 in my experience,
once a cop, always a cop.
 Then let me prove me self.
 Mister Maguire,
 I still have
two good eyes
 and I believe
what I see with 'em.
 The only way I'd ever trust
a fella like you
 is if you took out
one of your own.
 You'd have to kill
a Copper.
 Fair enough.
 Got just the fella in mind,
as well.
 We have to leave
for the wedding.
 There's too much to do
down here.
 Sara, the gown
you created will be perfect.
 The guests will welcome us,
conversation,
 there'll be dancing.
 Besides, we must go.
 Major Morehouse has agreed
to assist me
 in my search
for your mother.
 What? Matthew, no!
 I told you I don't wanna be
in anyone's debt.
 I have exhausted all options
in my search.
 She sold,
but I can't find out where.
 The Major's effort
will be our last
 and, most likely,
best resort.
 And Sara...
 You want to see
your mother,
 and our friend will help us
make that happen.
 So...
 Let us be friendly
in return,
 go and celebrate
his wedding day.
 You don't waltz in here
and dictate
 how the United States
Government
 goes about business,
son.
 Not when your people tried
to tear this goddamn city down
 just to avoid the draft.
 My people have done
more than their share
 in this war.
 Yeah, you Irish have a talent
for fighting and dying,
 that I'll give ya.
 These are kids
we're talking about.
 So you said.
 I'll fill you in
on a little secret.
 I don't give a tinker's damn
where these kids come from.
 We need bodies so bad
we're takin' niggers now,
 for chrissake.
 This is kidnapping,
Sergeant Major--
 Look, shitbird,
 I get that you've got
a job to do.
 So do I.
 And this goddamn war
tearin' our country apart
 is bigger than you, me,
 or a handful of
the Five Points slum rats.
 You, of all people,
 should damn well know that
to be true.
 Perfumed generals
don't win wars, Corporal,
 cannon fodder does.
 Stopped being a
corporal seven months ago, Sarge.
 Thanks for the time.
 Detective, I believe you
dropped somethin'.
 By sundown,
they'll likely be gone.
 You'll need to hurry.
 Go upstairs,
get changed.
 - Really?
- Yes.
 I'm not about to attend
a high society wedding
 by myself.
 The bride is ready, sir,
 Mister Morehouse,
your bride is ready.
 We need to begin.
 - My best man isn't--
- Right this way.
 This may be him.
There's his wife.
 Join me, James.
You've been drafted.
 This is highly unregular, sir.
 When have you known me
to follow convention?
 Besides, who better
to be my best man
 than one who sees me naked
each day?
 I require and charge you both,
 as ye shall answer
 at the dreadful day
ofjudgment
 when the secrets of all hearts
shall be disclosed.
 If either of you know
any impediment
 why ye should not lawfully
join together in matrimony,
 ye must now confess it.
 This cop we're lookin' for...
 I trust it's somethin'
personal?
 If it wasn't for this
fella, I'd still have my job...
 My old life.
 Really, though,
just better him than me.
 Always is, detective.
 Any prig
can pull a trigger.
 I'd prefer you get
your hands dirty.
 Unless you don't think
you can get this close,
 to see him in his eyes.
 I, Robert Luther
Morehouse, take thee, Elizabeth Victoria,
 to be my wedded wife,
 to have and to hold
from this day forward.
 For better and for worse,
 for richer and poorer,
 in sickness and in health,
 to love and to cherish
until death do us part.
 By the giving and
receiving of a ring,
 and the joining of hands,
 I pronounce
they are man and wife.
 Blood red on copper blue.
 In the name of the father
 and of the son,
and of the holy ghost...
 My favorite colors.
 May the Lord bless
and preserve you,
 both in this life
and in the world to come...
 There he is,
 the luckiest
one-legged millionaire
 in all of New York City.
 All of us millionaires
 are missing some part
of ourselves,
 Mister Donovan.
 A brain, a heart...
 And Missus Morehouse,
you look lovely.
 Why thank you.
 We may be neighbors soon.
 The Coddington place is rumored
to be up for sale,
 and the missus and I
will be putting in a bid.
 Oh, I would've thought
you'd be obligated
 to reside
in the sixth ward,
 considering
your political office.
 No, no, we amended the city
charter just last year.
 There's no requirement
for me to live anywhere.
 Isn't democracy
a beautiful thing altogether?
 Excuse me.
 The mayor sends
his regrets.
 Gunther's worried over
his reelection prospects.
 I'm well aware
of my "atypical" reputation.
 A reputation,
as some of us recall,
 that includes foiling
a dangerous Confederate plot
 single-handedly.
 There were a lot
of fine men who--
 and you'll be testifying
against Kennedy
 at his trial?
 As the proceedings are
a secret military tribunal,
 I can neither confirm nor deny
any involvement.
 What?
 How many of you
are there?
 Six.
 It's all right.
You'll be all right.
 McGrath?
 Detective Corcoran.
 Thank God you're here.
 I left word that
I tracked down my boy,
 and I was,
I was comin' down here
 to get him out of here...
 ...to get them all
out of here.
 "John Smith."
 Your boys would've
recognized you.
 That's why you hired
the Bavarian
 to go along with Doman.
 You Michael?
 Yeah.
 I'm a detective.
 Can you free the rest
of these boys?
 Yeah.
 You get all high and mighty
if you like,
 but you don't know him
or the other one...
 My so-called "sons."
 Years on the road
providing for them
 and their worthless drunk
of a mother,
 only to come home
and be treated like scum.
 They're your sons.
 They were her sons!
 Go on, get out!
 So you started
to sell 'em off?
 Well, it's about time
I finally got a return
 for them lazy shits.
 Sir!
 Michael, your brother is dead
because of this lousy bastard.
 I know.
 Still, I ain't sure Johnny
woulda wanted this.
 But he deserves to suffer,
 cold and alone,
like he left us here.
 Let him live out his days
in chains.
 Go on.
 Thank you, sir.
 Tell your ma she doesn't have
to worry about him anymore.
 Ungh! Argh!
 Whoa! Whoa!
 Don't seem near enough justice
to see you in chains.
 So you're gonna kill me?
 I'll give you a choice...
 more than you ever offered
your own sons.
 Either I end this now...
 ...or you learn firsthand
what dying looks like.
 Why, Annie Reilly,
what were you doing up there?
 Uh, looking for my coat.
I am well past my bedtime.
 We have people for that,
Miss Reilly.
 Tell the help
and they'll fetch
 your belongings.
 You never looked handsomer,
Mister Morehouse.
 Not exactly how I envisioned
our wedding night.
 Look at you, Robert.
 You may be a Morehouse
by name,
 but tolerance
for this indulgence
 takes a lifetime of practice,
my dear.
 I don't deserve you.
I don't deserve any joy.
 I'm a terrible person.
 Shh... you're exhausted.
 No.
 No... I'm a charlatan.
 A deceiver who...
 Before all of our friends
and family,
 before God himself...
 Elizabeth,
you're speaking nonsense.
 I know exactly whom I married.
 If you knew,
you would despise me.
 You could be
the devil himself
 and I would still find
you irresistible.
 I conspired in the plot
to burn New York City.
 I think, perhaps,
 we should take a rest
from the opium.
 Mister Kennedy came to me
shortly after Winfred's death,
 seeking financial support.
 I was vulnerable and I...
 This isn't funny.
 The fires were only to be
a sign of protest.
 When places were deserted,
no casualties.
 Elizabeth, stop!
 They preyed upon my naivetÃ©.
 Forgive me, Robert.
 Forgive you?
 Forgive you?!
 Do you realize that I exiled
my father for his involvement?
 My own father!
 What else are you
involved in?
 What lies have you sown?
 It was a terrible mistake,
I had nowhere to turn.
 Those vows you spoke earlier...
 Did you mean a word of them?
 Do you even love me?
 Yes, of course.
Of course!
 Robert, I love you.
Please, I need you, Robert.
 Robert, I need you!
 Please, if you testify...
 God, Robert!
Please! Please!
 Welcome to
the United States Army.
 Now for your...
enlistment bonus.
 I'll ensure his family
receives it.
 You find any more
fresh fish,
 you send 'em my way,
Irish.
 "Union now and forever,"
Private McGrath.
 Ellen, I should have sent word,
I know.
 Tonight, something came up,
something important.
 I had to keep
on the move.
 It's all right.
 I know I promised ya--
 I said it's all right,
Kevin.
 But you should apologize
to Mister Morehouse.
 There were lives
at stake.
 There always are.
 Say what you want to say,
Ellen.
 You have this instinct
to protect people, Kevin.
 I love that in you,
the nobility...
 But, sometimes, I can't help
but feel that you...
 You choose
to save others' lives
 at the expense
of our own.
 It was just a wedding.
 No, no, this is how life's
always been,
 ever since the beginning.
 When you were a boxer,
 you used to leave
for days at a time,
 going from match
to match.
 Trying to provide for us,
for our family.
 To give you things,
more than a dirt floor.
 How did volunteering
for another man's war
 provide for us?
 I did what I thought
was best.
 For you.
 For us...
 ...for our daughter.
 She was 18-months-old
when you left.
 You remember that time
we came back from Peekskill
 and Maggie was burnin' up
with this fever?
 And that first hospital
we came to
 refused to treat her
because we were Irish?
 How does going off to war
change that, Kevin?
 That day, I swore an oath
to myself,
 to Maggie,
 that she would never be
treated that way again.
 That she would grow up
to be seen as an American.
 By fighting
"another man's war,"
 it became my war,
my country.
 Our country.
 That Maggie belonged here.
 And yet the house
is empty.
 Detective!
 Come here.
 I thought it was the groom
that got cold feet.
 Loose ends with the McGrath case
needed... tying up.
 Let me give you a tip.
 You're fine police,
 and your dedication to the job
is admirable.
 Fellas like you and me..
where we come from,
 can't be passing up
opportunities,
 can't be breaking a commitment
to important people.
 So if you fancy a life
 beyond that hunk of metal
hanging in your pocket,
 you best start thinking
past the street.
 Yes, sir.
Thanks for the advice.
 I'm only looking out for ya.
 Now go have yourself a drink
on me.
 Thank you.
 All right?
 Richie.
 Evening, stranger.
 You have your money smile
on tonight.
 Not a vacant room
in the joint.
 We're filled
to the gills.
 Even your friend
Robert Morehouse is here.
 On his wedding night?
 Seems he's decided
to play the gander
 and spend the eve with anyone
but the new missus.
 Christ.
 Not that I'm complaining,
mind you.
 He tips like a turk.
 But you may wanna
check his pulse.
 Not looking so swell
yourself, Corky.
 Long day.
 Trouble at home?
 Never been better.
 Bullshit.
 Sometimes I am a butcher
 And then I feel fat ware
 Sir, and if the flank
be flesh-ed,
 Well, I take no further care
 Sometimes I am a baker,
and bake both white and brown.
 Kevin!
 Thank goodness
the cavalry has arrived!
 You want to hear
a real bawdy song,
 Corky here's your man.
 Lottie, get out.
 She hasn't heard
the shoemaker verse.
 She hasn't.
 Well, Kevin, you've managed
to ruin my day twice.
 Let me take you home.
 That is not even remotely
an option.
 Why? What happened?
 Are you taking an interest
in my wedding?
 Because there was a distinct
lack of interest earlier.
 I'm sorry.
I didn't have a choice.
 Truth be told,
 your absence was the least
of my disappointments.
 Are you talking
about Elizabeth?
 Why is it those we hold closest
deceive us?
 Everyone hides certain parts
of themselves, Major,
 especially from those
we care for.
 Well, have you shared
your worst with Elizabeth?
 Given her a glimpse
of how we were in battle?
 Because that's...
 That's something my wife
never needs to know.
 Certain things are best
left hidden away.
 So...
 You've forgiven Ellen?
 Let's just say I'm...
 ...trying to honor
my commitment.
 Just like on the battlefield.
 Shove up, Major.
You and me...
 We're bunkin' up tonight.
 Then take off
your goddamn boots
 before Kennedy strolls in.
 Something to drink,
Lady Sara?
 That'd be lovely,
Prince Matthew.
 Have some of Miss Heissen's
wine, hmm?
 You keep tellin' me
you're fine.
 I am.
 I will be.
 Yet here we are,
 lookin' out at that
same lamppost,
 thinkin' about what happened
to your brothers.
 Just a memory.
 That memory's
part of you.
 What you witnessed...
 It's something I'm tired
of runnin' from.
 Then what can I do?
 How do I help you
turn around and face it?
 You don't.
 Sara?
 Sara!
 Sara!
 - No more!
- Sara!
 No more, Matthew.
 No more!
 Ungh! Ungh! Ungh!
 Let's get the children home.
 Come on.
 Oh yeah.
 Oh my.
 Come on, let's go.
 Yeah.
 Oh yeah.
 Where's your damned partner?
 I, uh...
I sent word for him.
 Then this
is your case.
 Yes, sir, captain.
 I want names.
 I want the culprits
brought to me.
 Don't disappoint me,
O'Brien.
 I'm in a ferorious mood!
 Eyes up, gentlemen!
 Yes, sir.
 You do not sleep.
 You do not leave these streets
until every last crook,
 ramper and sneak-thief
is accounted for!
 Crack skulls!
Kick asses!
 Yes, sir.
 Do whatever you must.
 Find the no-good sonofabitch
who stabbed that boy!
 he was one of our own!
 See thatjustice is done.
