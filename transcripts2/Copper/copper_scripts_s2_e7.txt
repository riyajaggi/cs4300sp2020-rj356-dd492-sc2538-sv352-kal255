 So Benjamin kills himself
 and admits to murdering
his father,
 Alderman Stephen Bartlett.
 This case isn't done.
 Welcome back to New York.
 Let's just say you
and I make great business partners.
 Sara, my darlin'.
 What exactly happened
to my boys?
 I carry another child?
 Yes.
 Well, excuse me,
sleeping beauty.
 The precinct isn't a flophouse.
 I know.
 Detective, go home to your wife.
 I'll choose where I go.
 And I'll choose when.
 This vagrancy has to end.
 So either you go home,
go to a cathouse,
 or sleep on the street,
 like any normal
Five Points denizen.
 Can I help you,
Missus?
 You're in
need, are ya?
 Thank you, momma.
 You're welcome.
 What are they on about now?
 Nothing to cause concern.
 Oh, that's just
street sweepers.
 I don't even know
why they bother,
 with these mountains
of filth.
 I know it's strikingly
different
 from life on the plantation,
 but Five Points
has its charms, too.
 Yesterday, we saw a naked child
jumping up and down
 on a pile of dead,
bloated horses.
 I don't even think
my Sara noticed.
 Doctor, my baby girl,
Hazel, is sick. Real sick.
 What's wrong with her?
 Can't hold anything in...
same as all our neighbors.
 Hot fever.
 It's been a few days now,
and I don't know what to do.
 How many people are sick?
 It seems like half the block.
 The hospital turned us away
 so they puttin'
all the stricken in a flat
 on the second floor
of our building.
 This could take
some time.
 What the hell are you doing
in here?
 Downstairs neighbor
complaining about a leak.
 Go on now,
 or I'll stick you
like the pig you are.
 Ah! All right.
All right.
 The Board of Aldermen
vote should not be the problem.
 Being underbid on the project,
that is the danger.
 Miss Heissen.
 Thank you for coming down
so early.
 Ah!
Woman with child first.
 I need your assistance.
 An especially vexing pest
has been thwarting my business,
 but I currently lack
the leverage I need
 to get rid of him.
 You, my dear,
 are the perfect fraulein
for the task.
 Go on.
 Fortuitously,
this individual is due
 to be visiting
your establishment.
 Fancies girls that remind him
of his time in the tropics.
 At any rate,
I would like your help
 putting him in a more...
Compliant position.
 I can handle any position.
What's the angle?
 I'm trying to secure
the contract
 to build the city's
new aqueduct.
 This man is my only viable
competition still standing.
 Hmm.
 What's in it for me?
 Besides a lesson
in politics?
 Pfft! That's a lesson
I could teach.
 This gentleman
is a right-minded individual,
 deeply concerned
with establishing
 orphan asylums in his name
 after building his fortune
on the backs of 10-year-olds
 in his coal mines.
 Orrin Lansing.
 That son of a bitch
hypocrite
 who led the charge
to close down my place uptown?
 One and the same.
 Huh. Hmm.
 Bloody cat keeps staring...
 Something's not right
with this Bartlett case.
 Waiting to pounce.
 Come on, Corky,
 you've been stuck on this case
for more than a week now
 and still haven't found
anything.
 A rich boy killed his daddy
and himself,
 end of story.
 The girl's parents don't
even give a shite where she is,
 Why do you?
 Because Teresa Trembley
knows what happened to Bartlett.
 Missus O'Dwyer?
 Fellas, come take a look.
 Now Mab O'Dwyer's
vanished too.
 Empty as a woman's promises.
 You guys ever gonna stop?
 The Newcastle rail spur's
been abandoned, sir.
 Contract will not be awarded.
 We built a goddamned
train track to nowhere.
 All that worthless
stock money burned.
 Darling, off so soon?
 "Worthless stock?"
 What's the trouble,
Robert?
 No trouble, my sweet,
 other than the fact
that my glass is empty.
 Hell of a predicament
to find oneself in
 this time of the day.
 How much is lost?
 I'm not a fool, Robert.
 I know what a man
looks like in defeat.
 I bet you do.
 I can be
of some assistance.
 Forgive me, darling,
 but you don't have
the best record
 when it comes to assisting
the men in your life.
 Now, why don't you
run along...
 ...and find some poor,
destitute negros
 that actually need rescuing,
 and leave me the hell alone
to figure out what,
 if anything,
can be done here.
 Are you feeling
the kicks yet?
 As rough a pounding
as I've ever been given.
 He's a strong
little mule.
 You're a brave one,
Miss Eva.
 I would have gone in
for a cleaning myself.
 Crossed my mind.
 What changed?
 Who can ever say
what changes a person's mind?
 Sometimes life
just takes charge.
 So who's the lucky
father to be?
 Not that you could ever
tell for certain.
 There is a reason my name
is on the door, sweetheart.
 When I lie down,
 it's because
I wanna lie down.
 Or because I want something
from the man
 I lie down with.
 Compared to you girls,
I'm practically a virgin.
 Who is looking
for a good time?
 Oh. Watch it,
you big animal.
 There's our guest of honor.
 Oh, Corcoran,
you have a visitor.
 Missus McGrath.
 Detective.
 I'm afraid I need
your assistance again.
 What's the trouble?
 Since me husband's
most welcome departure...
 God bless him,
 my landlord's been
making advances.
 I pay the rent,
keep the place in order.
 No reason he should be
hornin' after me.
 What's he been doing?
 The other day he had me
cornered in the hallway,
 when me boy Michael
came upon us.
 I'd be happy
to sort him out for you.
 Oh, I can handle myself
all right.
 Not the first baboon
I've had giving chase.
 It's Michael
I'm worried about.
 He's the man
of the house now.
 Bit too eager
to play the part.
 He's gone
and got himself a gun.
 I'll go see the boy.
We'll have a little chat.
 Norbert.
 I was hoping
I'd find you here.
 It's Robert.
 Gone missing, has he?
 I'd check the usual
disreputable haunts.
 Your son...
is losing all your family fortune.
 And that surprises you?
 Surely you knew
when you married him
 he was good for little
beyond diversion.
 This is
the Morehouse legacy.
 All you labored to build
all these years.
 You would hate
to wind up penniless,
 wouldn't you?
Hmm.
 A senseless point to argue,
Norbert.
 Hmm.
 But more than that,
I'd hate for Robert
 to think himself
a failure.
 I have a meeting to keep.
 I wish you both
the best of luck.
 Just thought you should know,
 the boys and I stopped off
at the Trembley apartment,
 only to find the neighbor,
Mab O'Dwyer, disappeared.
 Took off kind of a sudden.
 That can't be a coincidence.
 Most people can't wait to get
the hell out of Five Points.
 The woman lived there
for 16 years
 and she suddenly ups
and leaves?
 Maybe she's sick of seeing
your ugly mug.
 What do you want?
 Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!
Enough, detective, enough!
 Enough of this bullshit
obsession
 with the Bartlett case.
 Yes, sir.
 And don't let me
tell you that again.
 Um, Donovan,
another issue, if I may?
 Finally,
a change of subject.
 I have a problem
with a certain landlord.
 I can smack the sin
out of him,
 but I'm trying to fix this
without raising a hand.
 Admirable change of pace,
 but sometimes one should stick
with the simplest method.
 I wanna set an example
for a kid
 who's seen his fair share
of violence.
 Who's the landlord?
 Hannigan...
over on Chatham.
 Ah, William Hannigan.
He's a real cavan man.
 As mean as they come.
 Best way to influence
a man like that
 is to go straight
at his wallet.
 He'll be suing for peace
in no time.
 How's that?
 Well, I'll have my secretary
send Patrick Daley
 from the buildings
department by.
 He'll perform a full-on
site inspection.
 Amazing the trouble
those lads can cause
 without raising a hand.
 Buy Daley a few drinks,
 and he'll put on
a real show for ye.
 Thank you.
 That's all right, my dear.
That's all right.
 Get it all out.
 Lean over, ma'am.
That's it.
 Who are you?
 Doctor Freeman.
 No kiddin'.
 The first negro doctor
I've ever seen.
 Well, welcome to Five Points,
 or should I say,
hell on earth.
 Thanks for the
welcome, but I live here.
 Whew!
That's awful.
 I thought the mission
sent you, too.
 What is your diagnosis?
 Well, I'd say we've got
a cholera outbreak
 on our hands.
 Same symptoms
of everyone I ask:
 uh, bloody diarrhea,
vomiting,
 dazed by fevers.
 I've not yet made it
to the back room,
 but I surmise
it's much of the same.
 No. No. No.
Leave me.
 I, I can't.
 And what am I gonna do
with writing at my age, Sara?
 It's just, it's...
It's just pure idleness.
 Your husband
wasn't at his office, so I...
 Is he here?
 No. He's out visiting
a patient.
 He may be a while.
 You're welcome to come in.
 That way you
can meet my mother.
 Hattie Lemaster.
 Momma, Ellen Corcoran.
 Ma'am.
 My friend.
 How are you finding
Five Points?
 Loud and crowded,
mainly.
 We were just
learning the alphabet.
 Pardon me, but I would
rather do something more productive.
 With all the projects
in a house,
 how often in your day
do you stop to read,
 much less write?
 Reading old correspondence
is my only comfort
 when the wrong memories
take over.
 When I hate to be alone,
 but I don't know how
to be around others.
 As if I were unworthy
of company.
 Recently, I've been...
 Ellen, you can speak
freely here.
 My mother and I,
 we are no strangers
to darkness.
 I feel it coming on.
 The knocking
and the crying in my head,
 like a storm about to break.
 I can't.
 Not again.
Not alone.
 Can't what?
 Raise another child.
 Have you told Kevin?
 I haven't spoken to my husband
in almost a month.
 He's forgotten about me,
about everything we ever had.
 He, he is ashamed of me...
 And maybe he should be.
 I can't be the messenger
bringing more bad news.
 Allow me.
Miss Ellen,
 you bringing him news
 tells him that
you are still his wife.
 He needs to hear that
from you,
 and real soon.
 The diseased
describe an abrupt onset;
 an indisputable characteristic
of cholera.
 Yet only the young and old
seem to be afflicted here.
 What are you suggesting?
 Cholera does not
discriminate by age or strength.
 It fells those in their prime
as well.
 Please, doctor,
 I was trained at the Columbia
college of surgeons.
 Is that so?
 Well, if this is cholera,
then tell me,
 why are there
no sick adults here?
 Good day.
 Afternoon.
 I, uh, thought I'd swing by,
 see how you been lately.
 Could be worse.
 Take a walk with me?
 I'm busy.
 It wasn't a question.
 Back after a piss.
 So, Michael,
 your mother says you're having
a problem with your landlord.
 Cod fish!
Cod fish here!
 Missus Corcoran?
 I'm looking for my...
 For Kevin.
 Uh, he's not here.
 If I were you,
I'd try back at night.
 This is where he's been?
 This is where he works.
 Should I tell your husband
you stopped by?
 No. Thank you.
 Never mind that.
 What did she want?
 Nothing from you.
 Come sit with daddy,
little monkey.
 Oh, you remind me
of this ripe little native
 I once knew in Guatemala.
 Let's see if you're
as malleable as she was.
 Aren't you thirsty, boy?
 Here,
let's have another.
 Fine idea.
 I do love my booze.
 To you, king Lansing.
 Ow!
 Giddy up.
 Daddy's going to ride you
till your kidneys quiver.
 Oh!
 Oh!
 We're going to get you
feeling better, Hazel.
 How is she, doctor?
 It's a difficult case,
I'm afraid.
 Well, he don't know
what's going on,
 and you's about as useless
as he is.
 With your fancy talk,
 you may as well be back
on that plantation
 bowing down
to them crackers.
 I am a free man,
a doctor,
 practicing medicine
in New York City.
 Free? Why, you's nothing more
than a white man's mule
 in a white man's war.
 Come around here
trying to think
 and act like the white man,
too.
 Oh, you talk all you want,
 but progress
and self-betterment
 are not the exclusive domain
of the white man, Mr. Turnow.
 And besides,
I'm the only mule you got.
 Go ahead, shoot.
 With what?
 Come on.
 Look at this poor bastard.
 I see that every day.
 So do I.
 But it's not pig's brains
that I see splattered.
 What of it?
 It's hard to tell sometimes,
 but there is a difference
between a man and an animal,
 and you'll know sure enough
 if you ever have
the misfortune
 of actually killing someone.
 If it was your mother,
what would you do?
 At your age?
 I'd probably have shot
the bastard...
 ...and then hung for it.
 My mother...
 I can't stand to see her
bothered like that.
 No woman should ever be.
 How about I take care
of that landlord,
 and then, if you want,
I could teach you to box
 so you can handle yourself.
 Hmm. Maybe that's
an okay idea.
 Nobody goes to
prison in this city
 for smacking somebody
that deserves it.
 But you shoot a man dead,
you're sure to hang.
 Well, if it isn't father.
 What bedeviling twist of fate
brings you to our door?
 Word on the street is...
 ...that the Morehouse fortune
is dwindling.
 Hemorrhaging funds.
 You need help.
 We already have a full staff,
father.
 Perhaps try the neighbors?
 I believe their housekeeper
recently took ill.
 I want back into
the business, Robert.
 It's rather sad
when one's elders
 begins exhibiting
early signs of dementia,
 wouldn't you say?
Hmm?
 You need my expertise.
 You'd be foolish
to pretend otherwise.
 Your return
to the family business
 wasn't ever part
of the plan, father.
 You were paid handsomely
for your testimony
 and now, your assistance
is no longer required.
 That big heart
you pride yourself on
 is a worthless attribute
in finance.
 Let him help.
 Why bother?
 The money's already gone.
 The money's already gone.
 I'll ask only once.
 Robert, please.
 Father...
You will work for me.
 Now get the hell
out of my chair.
 Mother of God!
 Oh no, not the camera!
 Shit!
 What've you been eating?
Anything unusual?
 I don't know.
 Same as I always do,
I supposed.
 Potatoes...
uh, odd scrap of meat.
 And you?
 I'm sorry.
 Where do you get
your water from?
 A well out back.
 Does Hazel drink
from the well out back?
 Yes. Yes, she does.
 Can you take me?
 Sure. They just dug
it not too long ago.
 Excuse me, Mister Morehouse.
 Hello, father.
Back already?
 Robert, I want you to meet
Mister Maillard.
 This is my son,
Robert.
 Mister Maillard.
 I want to talk to you
about something.
 You have my full attention.
 We've decided
to water the stock
 in both the northern
and Richmond,
 as well as the central,
Milford,
 and Raritan railroads.
 We?
 Mister Maillard here
is going to help us
 issue the necessary bonds.
 With my connections
in the western states,
 we're able to spread rumors
about which railroads
 will be stitched together
with the Union Pacific.
 Surely you must be joking.
 I never joke about money,
Robert.
 Well, I won't be part of it.
 My son,
a bastion of nobility.
 Modicums of deceit
are one thing, father,
 but I will not be part
of blatant corruption.
 It's no different
from that pathetic little spur
 in Pennsylvania
 into which you dumped
our fortune.
 Except, this time,
 we'll be on the other side...
the victorious side.
 The answer is no.
 If you would like a "yes",
go buy it from somebody else.
 We might have underestimated
 just how much tincture
is necessary
 to knock the pig out.
 Again, I'm very sorry.
 Hmm.
 Have I ever told you
about the time...
 ...I pissed in that pimp's hat?
 No.
 Hmm.
 It was quite an offloading.
 I nearly filled it
right up to the brim.
 I was a young patrolman.
 I thought humiliating that pimp
would go far
 towards keeping my beat
in line.
 It was an arrogant
miscalculation.
 Before the day was through,
nine men lay dead.
 A nasty bit of business.
 Speaking of nasty bits
of business...
 ...with all the conspiring
we're doing,
 I fear I've been
neglecting you.
 Neglect sometimes
feeds anticipation.
 That's it, Miss Heissen,
 just like old times.
 I can't believe those rebel curs
 are going to make the negros
fight their war for them now.
 It boggles the mind.
 As with
everything, the war boils down to money.
 Speaking of,
I saw your N and R is soaring.
 - Pardon?
- Mm...
 I only wish
I'd known to invest.
 You must be Patrick Daley.
 Ah, one in the same.
 Kevin Corcoran.
 Ah.
 So, you could use
my expertise
 with a particularly
vexing landlord.
 Aye. A drink?
 Certainly.
 Cheers.
 Ah...
 Another.
 What do you see
in front of you, detective?
 Besides a level,
a tape measure,
 and a plumb bob?
 The handsomest,
 most liberal tap jockey
in the whole Union.
 The more I pour,
the handsomer I get.
 Right.
 Now, they certainly appear
innocent enough.
 But in the right hands,
 these are less tools
of construction,
 than destruction.
 Mister Donovan,
I told him you were busy,
 but he threatened
to throttle me, sir.
 It's all right, lad.
 If I find out
you had anything to do
 with that perfidy
at Eva's Paradise,
 you will wish
you'd never left
 that rancid potato bog
you call home.
 Good day to you,
Mister Lansing.
 I was just going over
my proposal
 for the new aqueduct.
 If you think
you'll intimidate me
 into dropping my bid,
 well, you are as stupid
as you are duplicitous.
 I am a goddamn
honest businessman
 and I will not sink
to your level.
 What you call honesty,
 others might refer to
as thievery and extortion.
 Men like me
built this country
 with our own hands,
 and you foreign scum...
 ...are trying to subvert
everything we have done.
 I believe you mean
you exploited the hands
 of the red man
and the black man
 to build it for ye.
 Well, neat trick,
by the way.
 You laugh now,
paddy,
 but you know this:
 My associates and I...
 will purge that tammany
nest of vipers
 on Nassau Street...
 and sweep you back
into the sea
 once and for all.
 Let me tell you something:
 I'm an American.
 I am an American
and I will build that aqueduct
 whether you wish it
or not.
 And if you'll excuse me,
 I believe my next appointment
is here.
 Sisters,
please come in.
 Thank you.
 Have a seat, please.
 I can violate any structure
in the city into oblivion.
 Well, God bless ya.
 Ah. Don't bless me,
detective.
 Bless the organization.
 Tammany takes care
of its own.
 Well, let's see
if you can work your magic
 over on Chatham.
 Right.
 Steady as
a Methodist minister.
 I have a few buildings
ahead of you to start.
 Shall we say,
five o'clock?
 Five.
 You met my friend?
 I did.
 You're looking good.
 You went behind my back
and issued those bonds.
 You can thank me later.
 Father...
 Somebody had to
do something, Robert.
 After all, you have a wife
to keep happy now.
 The same way you made
mother happy?
 The only thing that made
your mother happy was gin.
 Maybe she drank
to escape life with you.
 I couldn't take a drink
out of that woman's hands
 without her other one
reaching for the bottle.
 That woman was my mother.
 And none too pleased
about it,
 truth be told.
 GRUNTS)
 Pull it.
 Norbert! Stop it! James!
 Stop it!
 Stop it! Enough!
 Stop it! Enough!
 What is wrong with you?
 Go on, go.
Get out of here.
 You would've killed me.
 I'm not the one
who drew a pistol.
 I'll not forget this day.
 I can't thank you
enough, detective,
 for talking sense into Michael.
 Your boy will be just fine.
 He's at a rough age
for any lad.
 Well, it helps a world being
around a man such as yourself.
 Is that a touch of kildare
I hear in your voice?
 I'm from Newbridge.
 Really?
 My mother was born
in Kilcullen.
 I know it well.
 My father favored
a butcher's there.
 Are you glad
you came here?
 Who wouldn't wanna
come to America?
 Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no, sir.
 This will most definitely
not do.
 Why, inspector, please.
 All the other steps
are up to code.
 Um, possibly you could,
 you could find it in your heart
just this once
 to, to make an exception.
 I'll do anything,
anything.
 What are you suggesting,
Mister Hannigan?
 This step here,
 in addition to the vertical
support issue in the entry,
 complicated by...
 oh my... my, my, my.
So many violations.
 Ah, surely you must
know my cousin,
 Kentigerna McGrath?
 Lansing's out of control.
He must be contained.
 I'm gonna need more
from ye.
 Aye... Sir.
 I want you on him
like a hemorrhoid.
 Anybody he sees,
everything he does,
 you bring to me.
No detail's too trifling.
 The man is an avowed enemy
of the Irish race
 who stands against everything
we hold dear.
 Is this official police
business, sir, or--
 What this is, Mister Maguire,
is you showing appreciation
 for being saved
from the gallows.
 For let's not forget
 evidence of a murder
once lost
 can always be found.
 O'Hearn.
 Ah, this water is rife
with it.
 Swarms of these oblong rods.
 I haven't seen anything
like it before.
 That poor girl.
 Can you do anything for her?
 I don't know.
 But I'm convinced
that this unknown contagion
 is what's to blame
for all the illness
 in that building.
 I know it gets to you,
seeing all that suffering.
 Sick and the lame
I can handle,
 it's my profession.
 What got to me today
was running into a black man
 as bigoted
as any white man.
 That's a sickness
I can't cure.
 I had half a mind
to smack his face good.
 What'd that have
accomplished?
 I would have settled
for satisfaction.
 Matthew,
after all you've achieved,
 to lower yourself
in such a way?
 It's done.
Let's move on.
 Fine.
 Ellen Corcoran
stopped by today,
 asking to speak
with you.
 I told her you were
attending to patients.
 She seemed troubled.
 Well, sadly for her,
that's not unusual.
 Matthew,
she's with child.
 I know.
 Well then you must also know
that she's not doing well.
 In her head,
I mean.
 She hasn't told Kevin,
and I think...
 Sara, no.
 I'm just wondering
if we might help
 in some way.
 It is not our place
to interfere.
 You can't heal a marriage
like a disease.
 Sara.
 Sergeant told me
that you were here.
 Everything all right
with Matthew?
 Oh yes, he's fine.
 I came
for another reason.
 Ellen stopped by today,
looking for my husband.
 Well, is she unwell?
 She needs you...
 ...at home with her,
instead--
 I appreciate your concern,
 but at times
there are matters
 between a husband
and wife that--
 Kevin,
she's pregnant.
 Get up! Get up!
 You slept with my wife again,
you son of a bitch!
 You're wrong, Corky.
I did not touch Ellen.
 Then...
whose child is my wife carrying?
 I have no idea.
 Take a breath.
Take a breath!
 You're a goddamn lying bastard.
 I trusted you once.
Never again!
 That's fair play,
 but I swear on the friendship
we once had.
 Francis...
 The child is not mine,
Kevin.
 It's not.
