 You need to make sure
you rest.
 Please,
I feel good these days.
 Brigadier General
Brendan Donovan.
 We have to be smarter!
 - Oof!
- Better!
 They captured the traitor,
Kennedy.
 Great news indeed.
 I want you to
take over my practice.
 I no longer live
in Five Points.
 I shall rue the
act of freeing you
 for the remainder
of my days.
 This lad here, number seven,
just upped and disappeared.
 Same as the other sons,
brothers, cousins,
 all from Five Points.
 Two dead,
five missing.
 I can't have a repeat killer
haunting my streets.
 Two bodies,
 maybe the other five
were kidnapped.
 Even worse...a killer
and a kidnapper.
 Donovan, you ever hear
of hydrargyri chloridum?
 I thought you were a Copper,
not a chemist.
 There's a doctor
 who helps me with cases
from time to time.
 Now, McGrath,
this boy,
 was found face down
in a pit of his own vomit.
 This doctor found traces
of hydrargyri chloridum
 in that vomit.
 The second body
was the same...
 ...vomit laced with the drug.
 So either our neighborhood's
found itself a new addiction--
 or someone's poisoning
our boys.
 So you're saying you believe
that Michael McGrath is innocent
 of his brother's murder?
 Innocent and still missing.
With hope, alive.
 And if these other kids
were poisoned,
 we need to figure out
who they were with
 and where they were drinking.
 Let's not let the body count
get any higher,
 hmm, detective?
 Kevin...
 Where are Maggie's things?
 Did Annie steal them?
 Or did you?
 You want this to be over,
but it will never be over.
 Ignore me, that's just fine!
 Maybe you can force Maggie
out of your life,
 but you cannot force her
out of mine!
 You can't make me forget
or forgive myself!
 What did you do, Kevin?!
 Oh no...
 I didn't know what to do,
Corky.
 Your Ellen was acting
all loony again.
 Was that...
your Maggie's?
 Don't say nothin',
child.
 It's him!
It's the Rebel Kennedy!
 Come on, it's that
bastard, Kennedy!
 Come on,
let's get him!
 Traitor!
 Get him!
 Robert...
 Oh, Robert.
 I'm glad you're here.
 You have to help me.
 They're treating me
like a savage.
 I'm an innocent man
being held on false charges!
 You know this!
 Well, you tell 'em,
they'll listen to ya.
 You've been charged
as a Confederate spy,
 yet you claim innocence?
 I do.
 You cannot possibly believe
that you're guiltless.
 I was acting
under confidential orders
 from the highest
of ranks.
 Oh?
 Misters William H. Seward
 and Ulysses S. Grant
ordered the attack.
 They were the masterminds.
 Kennedy,
you are entirely insane
 or quite crafty.
 Now, I stopped by
not to converse,
 but to inform you
 that I intend to testify
at your trial
 and ensure that you hang!
 Lock him up!
 Name's Maguire.
 - Criminy.
- Seamus.
 Francis Maguire himself.
 Welcome to the Druids.
 The fake cash gang.
 They, um, the higher-ups,
 they prefer to call it
a "Financial Firm."
 It's a far cry from yer days
at the precinct, eh?
 What's the job?
 Boodle carrier.
Same as me.
 We take our firm's currency
to merchants around New York,
 in exchange
for the real thing:
 Say a hundred of our bills
for five genuine bank notes.
 Those merchants give
their customers
 our reproductions
as change
 and their profits
blow up.
 It's brilliant, no?
 And who runs this ship?
 Manager oversees all this.
 Above him is the forger.
 The master,
he's a true artist.
 Goddamn Mona Lisa,
the greenbacks he creates.
 I thought the Mona Lisa
was a painting,
 not an artist.
 I was just saying
the work he does--
 How do we get paid?
 When we bring back
the merchant's clean cash,
 we get a cut.
 The Druids...
They don't mess around,
 like to them,
it's no matter.
 A gun, a knife...
they're not weapons,
 they're just tools
to get a job done.
 When do I start?
 You happen to know
two brothers
 by the name of McGrath?
 Yeah, John and Michael.
 Yeah, they were in
a few days back,
 Wednesday past.
 It was an odd night
for the brothers though.
 How'd you mean?
 Well, when the boys belly up,
they hold their own.
 But they were both lightweights
that night.
 A couple of drinks,
so was swell.
 Then these two gents
bought 'em a third round.
 Halfway through their mugs,
 the McGraths nearly dropped
to the floor,
 and those two fellas had
to help the boys home.
 Disturbing my staff,
Corky?
 I got two brothers...
one dead, one missin'.
 Growing more likely
this was their last stop
 before fate stepped in.
 More than one man's
spent his last night here.
 Hardly men.
 John and Michael McGrath.
 Ha! The McGraths.
 Admirers of the Creole girls.
 They were last seen here
Wednesday.
 Did you happen to...?
 Um, I was otherwise
engaged that night.
 Oh...
 We talked with their mother,
but she's a lost soul.
 The father, Brogan McGrath,
he's a queer one.
 You ever hear the boys
talk of him?
 In passing.
 Far as I know,
I've never met the man myself.
 They claim he disappeared
when they were small...
 ...said he headed West.
 Returned a few months ago
just after the election,
 and when the boys asked him
where he'd been,
 the father said
he was in on
 the California gold rush.
 The gold rush dried up
a decade ago.
 Well, the men in this town
are not necessarily known
 for their honesty.
 The McGrath brothers
ever say anything
 about their dad
being a soldier?
 If he had been,
 you'd think he would have
told them about that glory,
 instead of some tale
about being off
 searching for a pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.
 Thanks, Richie.
 Those clean?
 Yes, ma'am.
Let me see.
 Check 'em again.
 Fake bills
are in full sway.
 Okay.
 What can I get ya?
 Lookin' dapper in those duds,
Maguire.
 Ya present yerself
as high king,
 they see ya as high king.
 You said this was
an upper crust buyer.
 Indeed it is.
 Tare an'ouns.
 Nellis' is using
fake greenbacks?
 Most everyone is.
 Best goddamn bakery
in New York?
 Hmm.
 Let's forego the dance
this time
 and I'll just ask:
Why?
 We have built a lovely life here
in Carmansville.
 I made a vow to Doctor Hegel,
 that I would help and heal
those in need.
 Without his presence
in Five Points,
 there will be
a formidable void.
 And I can split my time
treating the sick
 between Carmansville
and Downtown.
 Matthew,
you are a remarkable man,
 and doctor,
 but you cannot physically run
two practices by yourself.
 And I am not about to go back
to the depths of darkness
 to assist you.
 I'm not asking you
to come with me!
 But I have made my decision.
 I'm going to take over
Dr. Hegel's Five Points office.
 All right.
Just over there.
 Thank you.
 Doctor Freeman!
Doctor Freeman,
 my young'uns are ill.
 Their foreheads are afire.
 We heard you were back.
Praise the lord.
 Come on in,
come on in.
 All right, baby,
just sit here now.
 Yes, I'm back.
 You can't remember one name?
 One fella yer boys
had trouble with?
 Nah. They were
friends with everyone.
 No enemies, no threats,
no fights?
 Nah.
 When's yer husband
due back?
 Hell if I care.
 If I'm lucky,
 Brogan's wrapped
in the wheels
 of a rockaway carriage.
 Christ, lady...
 Mrs. McGrath,
 I know you've had a rough ride,
recently,
 but you should have a bit
more respect for yer husband
 after what he's been through.
 What are you
going on about?
 Him serving his country
in the Union Army,
 same as I did.
 You fell for that line
of nonsense?
 Ah, you know...
to hell with him.
 To hell with this country,
this city.
 Nothing but a horror story
since the day we arrived.
 And now it's gone
and taken away me family,
 me sons.
 A wee taste?
 Maybe you should take
a rest from the drink.
 Swear to Christ,
 it's the only way
 I can face not having me boys
near to me.
 Besides, I never had much
of a taste for it
 'til I ended up here.
 My father used to say,
 there's something to be said
for being with someone
 and not feeling the need
to talk all the time.
 Breathe deep for me.
 Hmm.
 Just sitting together,
or walking in silence.
 When Kevin and I were
first courting,
 there was a kind of beauty
to the silences.
 But not anymore.
 Our silences, now,
are filled with blame.
 With disgust
and distrust.
 Ellen, I...
 Your focus is improving greatly.
 Kevin sent away
all of Maggie's belongings.
 Her toys, her clothing,
everything.
 Ellen,
you are suffering greatly.
 Both of you are suffering.
 While you faced horrors
here at home,
 Kevin faced his own horrors
on the battlefield.
 To watch his friends die,
 to kill men
whom he knew had families...
 Men not unlike him.
 And to barely escape
his own death
 when he attempted to desert--
 He hasn't told you?
 When Kevin received word
that Maggie had died,
 and that you had...
disappeared,
 he ran away from camp
 to find you,
to say goodbye to Maggie.
 But he was caught,
convicted,
 and sentenced to execution.
 And Kevin sat in chain,
waiting for death,
 talking of you
and your daughter,
 and of the mistake he'd made
of leaving you here.
 Major Morehouse used
his influence
 to get Kevin pardoned,
 under the condition
that he go back into battle.
 All the while knowing that
his family had fallen apart.
 Brogan.
 Detective Corcoran.
 Out on the beat,
huh?
 Off duty today,
would you believe it?
 Could get used to this life.
 Maybe take an early
retirement, huh?
 Smoke?
 Love one.
 Just ran into one of the lads
from my old regiment,
 haven't seen him
in over six months.
 You know when ya...
 ...when you don't see someone
for a long while
 but when you do,
seems like no time has passed?
 Oh, for sure.
 You just pick up
where you left off,
 you know what I mean?
 It's the same with me
and the fellas I served with.
 Maybe it's because of the boys
taking Fort Fisher, but...
 I've been reminiscing...
 What would you say
you miss most
 about being in the army?
 Ooh...
That's a tough question.
 Certainly it wasn't
ducking bullets, eh?
 If you asked me,
 I'd have to say
the camaraderie, y'know?
 "Bucking and gagging."
 Oh yes!
The bucking and gagging
 got us through
some tough times,
 to be sure.
 Bucking and gagging...
 What, you like...
 ...having a piece of wood
shoved in yer mouth,
 yer whole body tied
with planks and boards?
 For days, you can't move,
you can't talk?
 That's what you miss
about the Union Army?
 Military punishment?
Torture?
 Hey, I misunderstood!
Bullshit!
 Your wife was right;
 you're nothing but a goddamn,
no good, lying fraud!
 Impersonate a soldier?
 Sacrilege!
 Your sons, your wife,
they deserve better than you.
 Aghhhh!
 Regarding the ceremony...
 I don't understand
what you're saying!
 Sorry...
 From the book
of common prayer...
 Speak, pray,
preach what you wish.
 It's all the same to me.
 Reverend?
 You have made
this dress disgusting!
 What on earth could be
the cause of such commotion?
 She dares suggest
changing the pattern.
 Uh, Sara,
what was your suggestion?
 Uh, I thought
that perhaps...
 We'd try the lacing
in the front,
 from the collar,
to the hem.
 Well, I quite love the idea.
 Mrs. Haverford,
 this is not a corset,
it is a wedding gown.
 Yes, my wedding gown.
 And it is your behavior
I find quite disgusting.
 Sara, your work
is quite lovely.
 This evening,
Robert and I are hosting
 Mr. Frederick Douglass,
reformer and orator.
 He will be speaking
in our music room.
 Please attend.
 I think you'll find him
most captivating.
 Twenty-one, twenty-two,
 twenty-three, twenty-four,
twenty-five.
 There we are now.
 Yer pile's only
waist-high, Hurley.
 The deal was fifty of yours
for five hundred of ours.
 No, no, no, no.
 Twenty-five!
It's always been twenty-five.
 'Tis not what I was informed.
Seamus?
 'Tis not what
we was informed.
 I will pay
only twenty-five.
 I always pay
only twenty-five.
 That is final.
 Aye.
 Well, if y'say it's final...
...I guess it's final then.
 Hey! Those aren't free!
 You see though,
 the thing you gotta remember
about tobacco...
 ...is it burns.
 If I come back from Chicago
with a million dollars
 say you'll marry me.
 I will.
 - You're the best.
- I know.
 Miss Heissen!
 Looking ravishing.
 That I already know,
General Donovan.
 Enlighten me
with something I don't.
 Have you been introduced
to the table game faro?
 It's a steadfast money-winner
for the house,
 and I happen to know
a most trustworthy dealer,
 who'd be honored
 to run the bank
for your establishment.
 Let's discuss it further
in your office.
 This gentleman here,
Mr. um...
 That's the George Becks.
 Mr. Becks is a performer
on Broadway.
 He's gonna give you
a little acting lesson,
 help you attract
the kidnappers.
 Okay, but why me?
 These kids,
they were all the same type:
 Strong,
fifteen to eighteen years old,
 shitty households,
 and they're irish.
 But I'm twenty-seven.
 You look sixteen,
and you're Irish.
 And when I'm finished
wrapping ya,
 you'll at least appear
to be strong.
 Let's work on
your performance.
 Now watch what I do
and repeat.
 "Now me mother's
gone, I'm an orphan.
 I got no one.
Please buy me a drink, sir."
 Now you try.
 Okay.
 "Now that my
mother's gone, I'm an orphan."
 Stop, stop!
What is that?
 I'm... acting?
 No, it most certainly is not.
Listen!
 "Now that my
mother is gone, I'm an orphan."
 You try it.
This time with feeling.
 "Now that my mother is gone..."
 Oh my god,
you're just deplorable.
 If there is any threat today,
it is to the art of the theatre.
 Once again.
 "Now that my
mother is gone, I am an orphan.
 I have no one and no home.
Please, buy me a drink, sir."
 Edmund Kean is turning
in his grave.
 This amateur
is beyond hopeless,
 and I'm wasting my time.
 Good day.
 I'll see you out,
Mr. Becks.
 Good.
 Thanks.
 I end as I began...
 No war but an abolition war;
 no peace
but an abolition peace.
 Liberty for all,
chains for none.
 A black man,
 a soldier in war,
 a laborer in peace;
 a voter at the South
as well as at the North;
 America his permanent home.
 And all Americans,
 his fellow countrymen.
 This, fellow citizens,
 is my idea of the mission
of the war.
 If accomplished,
 our glory of our nation
will be complete.
 Our peace will flow
like a river,
 and our foundation will be
the everlasting rocks.
 Mr. Douglass.
 With the thirteenth amendment
 in the hands
of the state legislatures,
 there is great hope
that your speech
 will be one remembered,
 and your vision,
one realized!
 Find Phinbar,
get him dressed.
 We're heading to Eva's
at half-nine.
 Phinbar!
 You got a
moment, detective?
 Please tell me you're not here
to report a missing teenager.
 Thank the Lord,
no, I'm not.
 This afternoon,
 I stopped by your home
 to give Ellen
her regular check-up.
 How's she doing?
 Motor skills have improved.
 Heart rate and lungs
are normal, healthy.
 Seems as if she'll make
a full physical recovery.
 How's she doing,
Matthew?
 Her head is clearer,
much clearer.
 Full access to logic,
emotions, memories.
 She spoke of your past
and your present together.
 Maggie's belongings...
 I did what had to be done.
 I'm not taking a side.
 I'm only telling
what we spoke.
 And I may have made
a mistake...
 And I could've stopped talking,
but I...
 ...probably should have.
 And I went on and...
 ...now she knows of your effort
to get home.
 I didn't know she was unaware
of your desertion.
 And I'm sorry, Kevin.
 It's not my story to tell.
 Mr. Douglass,
 I am blessed with a husband
who cares deeply for me,
 as I do him.
 But I want to live
my own life.
 And I'm having a impossible time
reconciling my past.
 For many years,
 I retained the bitterness
from my days of captivity.
 But slowly, over time,
 I allowed myself to evolve...
 ...out of necessity.
 When the moment is right,
 you will embrace the joy
of true freedom.
 You will take an action
 and then be able...
to evolve.
 The Herald is
running the piece.
 Two boys dead,
several more missing,
 that's a hell of a story.
 I'll not let you charm
or bully me into burying it.
 I like the fact that we're both
in the story business.
 People come to me
with stories all day...
 ...widows who lack pensions
with children to feed,
 working men
unable to find gainful employ,
 immigrants scared and alone
in a strange land.
 It's my job,
my mission as it were,
 to find a happy ending
to these stories.
 Where was it that you said
you were from again?
 You know damn well
where I'm from.
 Oh yes, Pawtucket.
 I even happen to have a story
about a man from Pawtucket.
 He's a good man,
 a staunch protestant,
 even helps out around
the chancellery
 when the vicar is ill.
 He has six adorable children,
 and a lovely wife.
 Does this story have a point?
 Every story has a point,
Mr. Coddington.
 Because, you see,
this man from Pawtucket,
 he travels when he works.
 And when he does,
he enjoys an activity
 for which
he is not known locally
 to be an aficionado.
 What are you talking
about?
 Please,
 drunk and out of town
don't count, right?
 I'll not be lectured on alcohol
by an Irishman.
 but this fascination,
obsession,
 for negro ladies
of the night?
 You scheming papist bastard!
 And no one's gonna believe
a bunch of coal-skinned whores.
 Oh, you're right!
 You are right.
Hm...
 Ah. Which is why...
 I have the sworn affidavits
of six hotel managers,
 and over a dozen chambermaids.
 That's unconscionable.
 Now, I need your help
finding an end to this story.
 Does the man from Pawtucket
 agree not to run the article
on the dead and missing boys...
 ...being that it needlessly
inflames the public
 and most likely tips off
the perpetrator
 causing him to skip town,
 never to be caught
or convicted?
 Or does the man from Pawtucket
awake one morning
 to read about his predilections
for negro flesh
 in the pages of
the Herald's competitors?
 Happy ending...
Or sad?
 You choose,
Mr. Coddington.
 Mister O'Hearn...
 Oh paddy dear
 And did ye hear the news
that's goin' 'round
 The shamrock
is by law forbid
 Can I take upstairs?
 Yes.
 Saint Patrick's Day
no more
 We'll keep his colors
can't be seen
 For they passed
the bloody law
 Against the wearin'
o' the green
 I spoke with Napper Tandy
 And he took me by the hand
 He said
how's dear ol' Ireland,
 And how does she stand?
 She's the most
distressful country
 That you have ever seen...
 Now that's my momma's gone,
 I'm an orphan.
 I got no one
and no money.
 Buy me a drink,
would ya?
 Piss off, ya wee scut.
 ...hangin' men and women
 For the wearing
of the green
 So since the color
we must wear
 Is England's cruel red
 Let it remind us
of the blood
 That Irishmen have shed
 Oh, I've not yet
had the chance to tell you.
 I paid a visit
to Robert Cobb Kennedy.
 And?
What did you say?
 That I would testify
to everything I witnessed
 while in his company.
 My words will ensure
that he'll swing.
 The man's mind
was in shambles.
 Or acting
as if that's the case.
 Elizabeth...
 Sorry, Robert.
 So very sorry.
 What? You have
nothing to apologize for.
 I don't know.
 At times, I think I should
have stayed in England.
 You don't know
what you're saying.
 You must be exhausted.
 The drink and the opium
 only exacerbates
such tiredness.
 You're still fairly new
to its effects.
 Rest on my shoulder.
 It's foolish, really.
 To believe oneself a hero,
 to seek fame and ovation
 by killing masses
of innocent citizens.
 Perhaps fiendish vanity
is a more appropriate phrase.
 We'll be there,
Elizabeth.
 We'll be there
on the day that he hangs.
 Nattie Hat:
Beer.
 Hey, mister.
 Now that my
momma's gone, I'm an orphan.
 I got no one
and no money.
 Buy me a drink,
would ya, mister?
 Here you go.
 - Just one?
- Thanks.
 Evenin'. Seems your mug's
about empty.
 How 'bout a drink on me?
 Sure, mister.
 A beer.
 Ten cents for the two of them.
 Thank you much.
 From around these parts?
 No.
 How old are you,
kid?
 Nineteen.
 Thanks. For you.
 O'Reilly!
I've been lookin' for you!
 Where is my money?!
 Come on, boys!
Oh, here it goes!
 Ughhh!
 You don't want that!
 Come on! Come on!
 Against the wall!
 Who the hell are you?!
 Who the hell are you?
 I'm a Copper,
ya blowhard!
 I'm just a fella
grabbing a beer.
 What's this about?
 Oof!
 Oh, yeah?
 It's about murder.
 Two dead boys.
 Oof!
 You goddamn thief!
 The man's name is Tim Doman,
 according to one
of Eva's ladies.
 Sullivan's got patrolmen
searching the city over.
 Doman will be in Irons
by tomorrow,
 we'll find those missing boys.
 So what now?
 Home.
I'm going home.
 We hand-picked you
weeks after becoming a widow.
 I sat beside you in that
lavish drawing room of yours
 as you agreed to lucrative
southern cotton contracts
 in exchange for investing
nearly every cent you had left
 in our "Plot".
 All of it to preserve
your pitiful dream
 of remaining a member
of that upper class
 to which you
so desperately cling.
 My involvement was meant
to bring peace.
 And yes, I admit,
increase my wealth.
 Just tell me true,
 do you intend to tell
the authorities
 of my involvement?
 Well, that depends...
 Oh, do you hear dat?
 It's like one of d'em
goddamn seals
 barkin' down at the docks.
 Your epiglottis is inflamed,
 the back of your throat,
 and your lungs are congested.
 That's why you're coughing
in that way.
 Am I dyin'?
 No, you'll be fine.
 You have what's called
"Croup."
 I'm going to give you
some thyme,
 it's an herb.
 Do you know how
to make tea?
 I'm Irish,
ain't I?
 Yes, you are.
 Use these leaves to make
fresh tea three times a day.
 Within a week,
your cough will subside.
 I, uh...
Well thanks now.
 But would ya mind
not telling anyone
 that I saw a nigger?
 I mean,
a negro doctor?
 Maggie's things...
 Y'see, if there's a problem,
I act.
 I try to fix it.
 That's just the way I am.
 But if in trying to help,
I hurt you,
 then I'm, I'm sorry.
 Sara! What are you...?
 Did you travel all this way
on your own?
 No.
 Mr. Monroe and his brother
 kindly drove me
in their carriage.
 Sit.
 You've only just opened
this office
 and already you spend all
of your time here working.
 You don't eat,
you don't sleep.
 This isn't healthy
for you, Matthew...
 ...or for us.
 To be honest,
I don't know where we are...
 ...in life, in marriage...
In mourning.
 It's time for me to...
Evolve.
 I now know things
about myself
 that I've never known before.
 We were to have a child,
and I was to be a mother,
 a strong mother.
 But it wasn't the Lord's will.
 Instead,
I will be a strong wife,
 a strong woman.
 If this is where life
has brought us, Matthew,
 then I will accept
and embrace it.
 I want to help you
help people...
 ...because I want you.
 Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh
 Ooh... ooh... ooh... ooh
 The truth will ever hide
 Even though I tried
 They tried to take my pride
 But they only took
my father from me
 They only took my father
 Even though I cried
 Even though I tried again
 God be with you, Ireland
 God be with you, Ireland
 Sometimes I was afraid
 Even though I prayed
 I've lost my religion now
 You took that too somehow
 Blood upon thy hands
 Blood upon thy hands again
 I have served my time
 God be with you Ireland
