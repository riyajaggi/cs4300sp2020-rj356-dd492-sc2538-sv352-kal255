 I conspired in the plot
to burn New York City.
 Please, if you testify...
 I refuse to continue
to be a part of this.
 Now's not the time
to be stupid.
 I will not involve
my husband in my mistakes,
 and you will not become
free of this jail.
 We found the plantation
to which your mother was sold.
 I, personally, will go
to the plantation
 and shepherd Sara's mother
to your door.
 You saved my life
when New York burnt.
 Agh!
 Now I saved yours.
We're square.
 Detective Maguire.
 Shake the man's hand,
Detective.
 Go away, you devil. Go!
 That little brat
was looking up skirt!
 New York City celebrates
inauguration day!
 Paper, get your paper here!
 Detectives,
sorry to keep you waiting.
 Come on in.
 We have a man dead
in the Center Street tenement,
 an uptown man,
wealthy, visible,
 and wouldn't you know,
good.
 Alderman Stephen Bartlett.
 He was earnest.
 He attended to the needs
of immigrants and the poor.
 He deserves no scandal.
 Investigate prudently,
discreetly...
 All specialties
of Francis Maguire.
 Careful now.
 Collaboration is the best way
to erase the mark...
 ...Keating left
on the sixth precinct.
 You and Francis Maguire
are like-minded opposites,
 the best detective pairing.
 The city will be headed
to Union Square
 for inauguration festivities.
 A good distraction
from any scandalous findings.
 Sara! Oh!
 Oh!
 Oh, my darlin'!
 - Mama!
- My darlin'!
 Oh, let me get
a look at you!
 Oh beautiful
Sara Freeman!
 Look at you,
you a married lady.
 Mmm.
 Mama, I've been afraid
to let myself
 consider this moment
and now praise God!
 You've changed our lives.
 How did you convince them
to free her?
 There was no freeing
of Hattie Lemaster.
 There was a purchase,
for quite a bundle of bills.
 My family is forever
in your debt.
 Matthew, forever is
a terribly limitless void.
 Matthew! Matthew!
 Sweet Matthew.
 Thank you for lookin' after
my baby girl.
 Look, I have
another son!
 Yet another blessin'!
 How about the rest of 'em?
 Where are y'all hiding
your brothers?
 No, I have had
a change of... heart.
 I will not testify
against Kennedy.
 Have you gone as mad
as our defendant?
 After all your effort
to stop that traitor
 from burning New York,
 you, on the very day
of the trial,
 choose to cripple
the government's case?
 Once, I myself
was termed a cripple,
 then I recognized
another way to walk.
 Robert Cobb Kennedy
will go free.
 Colonel.
 Confederate fire will
consume this city!
 I hope you will
blame yourself.
 What exactly happened
to my boys?
 The circumstance surrounding
Louis and Thomas' death
 were terrible.
 When I was uh...
 The draft riots
and things became...
 Chaotic.
 Louis and Thomas were called
to work extra hours
 on the ferry...
 ...as the Irish laborers
abandoned their jobs,
 abandoned normal life
in its entirety,
 and tore the city apart.
 On...
 ...July 13th,
 during a crossing
to Greenpoint,
 two ferries collided.
 When the engines
caught fire,
 Louis and Thomas loaded
passengers into lifeboats...
 ...to safety.
 A surviving crewman
told me
 they acted with no regard
for their own lives.
 He called them heroes.
 Is this it?
 Aye.
 Not where Alderman
Bartlett expected to meet his end
 I'll wager.
 Hey, Copper.
 Ah, Christ, of all the...
 Jesus.
 Francis, you need me
to stand down the kitty-cat?
 Aw, shut your...
 I can't stand them!
They're witches!
 Don't pretend your ma
didn't warn you a 100 times.
 Hey!
 Out!
 His pocket watch
survived.
 Whoever lived
here is long gone,
 but someone took time
to pack up.
 A woman.
 Strangled,
but not with a normal rope.
 See how thin it is?
Cut right into him.
 His coat's still here.
 Alderman Bartlett,
what were ya really up to
 down here in Five Points?
 Corky, the only reason
 you end up in that position
is sex.
 No, no, Miss.
 And to think Teresa considered
that the best ass she could get.
 Teresa who?
 Teresa Trembley,
of course.
 And Teresa was from
outside the city?
 Came here
all by her pretty self.
 From Hamilton,
Ontario.
 Who are you again?
 Mab O'Dwyer.
 Longest tenant
in the Center Street.
 Congratulations.
What did ya see last night?
 The usual dance.
 Then something
 Another fella come by,
 and later there
was commotion.
 So the bloke,
what'd he look like?
 Ach, they hollered
a good lot
 before I nearly knocked
through the wall.
 So, ya didn't
actually see anything, then?
 The charges brought
against the defendant,
 Robert Cobb Kennedy,
are as follows:
 As a captain
in the military service
 of the insurgent states,
 was found acting as a spy
in the city of New York.
 In violation
of the Law of War,
 undertook irregular
and unlawful warfare
 in the city of New York
by setting fire thereto.
 How does the accused plead?
 Not guilty to all charges.
 Are you prepared to proceed
with this trial
 under the judgment
of these officers?
 I am...
 And I will defend myself.
 Yeah, yeah...
 Good morning.
 Good mornin'.
 Oh my god,
you're pregnant!
 You didn't know?
 Should I have?
 The way gossip moves
in this town?
 Lovely news, actually,
 that a woman can still have
a private life.
 No, Eva, tell me...
Should I have known?
 Personally,
I've never operated on shoulds.
 This concludes
the opening session
 of this tribunal hearing.
 We will reconvene
in one half hour's time.
 Hey.
 Your neighbor,
Alderman Bartlett,
 what do you know
of his wife?
 Corky, you always pick
the best ones,
 but as you can see
we're in the middle
 of a military tribunal--
 Then give me what you have,
quickly.
 The Alderman's first wife died
several years ago...cholera.
 Last winter,
he married Constance,
 a society doyenne.
 Sounds like good luck
after bad.
 Last month,
Constance went out to Paris,
 not scheduled to return
until spring.
 That'd be nice.
 It gets better.
 The Alderman has a grown son
by his first wife,
 a Benjamin.
 Since the wedding,
there's been uptown whisper
 that Benny's been putting
the wood to his stepmother
 who's younger than he is.
 I take it that Benjamin's
not in Paris?
 When Constance
flitted off,
 Benny moved out
to his family estate
 on the Bronx river.
 Ben fancies himself
a pianist.
 Art demands space
and beauty, Corky.
 Thank you.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Finally, the carriage.
 Goodness, they're hiring
anyone today, aren't they?
 - Ya uppity little--
- Hey!
 Um, we're the police.
We're from the sixth ward.
 The sixth? Unfortunate.
 I prefer to travel
in a bit more style.
 - Listen, we need to--
- Excuse me!
 You're smudging
my chesterfield
 with downtown filth!
 We need to talk about
your father.
 Bad timing.
 I'm playing at
an inauguration party--
 For the love of
Christ, get out!
 Please!
 Help! This is kidnapping!
 This man is a lunatic!
 Downtown filth?
 Sometimes it shines
like copper!
 There's a good lad.
 - Hup!
- Lovely day!
 Ha!
 Robert.
 Husband.
 So you are
returned from the South.
 I wish I had been invited
to the honeymoon.
 The Freemans...
 I've realized
in the last two weeks
 that I may not like
being in love.
 My actions were a mistake...
 ...born of lies, manipulation.
 I am the woman
you know,
 only now brimming
with remorse...
 ...and fear.
 If you could just...
 I have refused to testify
against Kennedy.
 Oh, thank God.
 You like Five Points?
 Seems like a good place
to do dirty work, huh?
 I have no idea
to what you refer.
 I am, however,
 unprofessionally,
uncharacteristically late for--
 Benjamin, we know
your father's recent marriage
 must have caused
a bit of stress.
 I see two explanations:
 You were jealous
pappy got himself a lady bird,
 wanted her for yourself,
 or you had her first
 and she claims
she couldn't choose.
 This is Constance, right?
 Tell us about your stepmother.
 Oh, hold the horse.
 Christ,
I'd be riding her, too.
 You would,
wouldn't you, Francis?
 While the Alderman was seeing
to the greater needs
 of the city,
 were you lying in his bed
screwin' his wife?
 No!
 What in the name of the law
and our Lord
 do you think you're doing?
This arrest is complete--
 Arrest?
 Oh, we merely invited the lad
to the precinct.
 Artsy types
love the decor.
 - Benjamin here was--
- You clowns!
 It's bad enough his
father died a tragic death,
 and now you're trying
to blame him--
 Father is dead?
 And now you're trying
to blame him with the murder?
 What happened to
my father? Where is he?
 What do mean dead?!
 Come on.
 What are you talking about?!
 Animals!
 You couldn't be bothered
to dance a step or two with him
 until we'd finished?
 I tried, obviously,
but these rich assholes...
 Captain.
 Donovan tells me
 you specifically promised him
discretion.
 Leave piano boy be
for now!
 I'll get someone else
 who knows how to control himself
to follow him,
 make sure he doesn't run off
to Paris!
 In the meantime, you two,
solve the damn case!
 What I wouldn't
give to tear apart
 that pretentious shit's house!
 We should work through
this first.
 Go by Center Street,
see if Teresa showed up.
 Captain,
could I have a word?
 Following up
on the Keating witnesses,
 have you had any sign
of Annie Reilly at all?
 she's the devil's brat,
Corcoran.
 In Five Points,
that means she's half-ghost.
 We'll arrest her one day.
That's just the way it is.
 Until then,
 don't pretend
she's important.
 Now go on,
get out of here.
 And so I am simply a citizen
 of the Confederate States
of America.
 You have no evidence tying me
 to the so-called
burnin' of New York.
 Now I challenge anyone involved
with these proceedings
 to stand and state otherwise!
 You have no case,
no evidence.
 I am nothing
but an innocent man.
 Thank you.
 You may resume your station
at the defense table.
 Hey!
 Piano wire.
 Where'd you kids
come across this?
 You heard him.
 Where'd ya get your toy?
 It wasn't nobody's!
 I found it in the empty
apartment up top there.
 It's all right.
 Up there?
 Teresa's apartment,
and Benny plays the piano.
 There's no sign that
Benny boy has been here.
 You find anything?
 Just this letter.
 It's dated two months ago,
from Teresa's mother.
 "Dearest daughter,
 your father and I worry so
about you.
 He is convinced the city
of New York is devoid of God,
 full of repulsive immigrants,
 papists and other cretins.
 Things are hard here,
but I have managed to put aside
 these five dollars to help you.
 It pains us not to have word.
Please write."
 The protestant orange bastards.
Don't mind if I do.
 No. Not on my case.
 Our case.
 Agh!
 Bigger noise and narrow streets
 are the least jarring parts
of Five Points.
 The smaller skies
stunned us most.
 Some nights you won't be able
to locate the north star.
 But you don't need it anymore.
 Move in any direction,
you're still free.
 Mama, our home.
 Which room?
 All of them...
roof to foundation.
 You're teasin'.
 We earn money and
we pay for the place we choose,
 same as the white man
that drove us.
 - Your gray pair.
- Sybil!
 - Get out!
- Honey, there are laws!
 There are laws
and I took an oath!
 Laws?! Laws?!
 Well, here's my law:
find someplace else to sleep,
 and don't be lookin'
for your breakfast here!
 Straight up,
and a room.
 Not a chance.
 You'll spot me,
won't cha?
 This look like
a bank to you, huh?
 Eva.
 Sounds like Sybil is driving
the O'Brien wagon again, huh?
 Aw, Christ!
 Here it is:
I was kicked out...
 ...when I was already outside.
 I got what you see
and that's the sum.
 Well...
 You help keep order tonight
and you'll get a room.
 If copperheads show up
to cause trouble,
 you'll convince them otherwise
or escort them out.
 You'll sleep
in a free bed
 when everyone else
is in theirs...paying.
 You and wife musta been
separated at birth!
 You've left me with no case!
 I am about to make
a closing statement
 and I have no closing
statement.
 Recite every detail.
 Cataloguing all possible
implications
 will reveal
Kennedy's guilt!
 You misunderstand
the mechanics of law.
 Please trust me,
I want nothing more
 than to proclaim
Kennedy guilty!
 Before my statement
disintegrates
 into an embarrassment,
 I am begging you
to satisfy that desire!
 At any moment,
before I conclude,
 we may add a witness.
Signal to the clerk.
 Your testimony may be brief,
but it must happen!
 As you can see, the defendant,
one Robert Cobb Kennedy,
 is a southern sympathizer,
as evidenced by his alliances
 and his history
as a combatant.
 Rail and hotel records
show that,
 not only was Kennedy
in New York City
 on the day of the arson
at Barnum's Museum
 and the six hotels,
 he was also registered
at Lovejoy's,
 one of the burned.
 While there are no witnesses
available...
 While the, while we have uh...
While uh...
 Uh, despite registering
at Lovejoy's,
 the defendant disappeared
after the fire.
 There is no explanation
for this abrupt departure.
 Of course, other individuals
were involved,
 however, it is clear
that the uh...
 It is clear that the uh...
 I would like to announce
a new witness.
 I call Mister Morehouse
to the stand.
 Mr. Norbert Morehouse.
 Benny needs to explain
 why his dad was killed
with piano wire.
 Knock again.
 Now we can't even
get the butler.
 Here, I got this.
 Wait!
 Somethin's not right.
 Our Benny-boy's in there,
I know he is.
 Let's not spook him 'til
we get him cuffed and then...
 Oh! Trying to drink your guilt
away there, Benny-boy?
 Ah, tare an'ouns.
 What's this?
A suicide note?
 "When you shall
these unlucky deeds relate,
 speak of me as I am;
 nothing extenuate
nor set down aught in malice:
 then must you speak of one that
loved not wisely but too well."
 What the hell
does that mean?
 After threatening me during
our meeting at Lovejoy's Hotel,
 I had no choice
but to deliver the money,
 which, in turn, delivered,
 to the doorstep
of the traitors,
 greek fire.
 That is the extent
of my involvement
 and of my witness.
 I can, however,
confirm with absolute certainty
 that the arson of New York City
was organized
 and primarily executed
by that man...
 ...Robert Cobb Kennedy.
 Objection.
 Quiet.
 Any further questions?
 Not at the present time.
 Then we will
allow for a brief recess.
 Welcome back
to New York.
 All right, get up.
Come on.
 And thank you.
 To a man of
contracts, a deal is a deal.
 Let's go.
 Elizabeth.
 And you're a fool
 if you thought I would forgo
saving Elizabeth
 to stay in Atlanta.
 That city is hell
with mint juleps.
 Remember those words,
 because you won't be
getting anything
 beyond our agreement.
 Still,
it is immensely satisfying
 to hear you admit your mistake
in supporting Kennedy.
 The only mistake I made
was getting caught.
 - Excuse me?
- Gentlemen.
 Might I suggest
that we embrace this opportunity
 for a fresh start,
 a new beginning
for us all.
 Absolutely.
 I'd like to see the two of you
behave like father and son,
 just this once.
 In memory
of your mother.
 Needs sugar.
 Sugar in your corn dodger?
You have become a yankee.
 If your collards are
as salty as I remember,
 we will be clinging to this
sweet yankee cornbread
 for dear life.
 Mama, here in the North,
 I have become the woman
I want to be.
 That's as clear
as well water.
 I'm proud to be
your mother.
 Mama, you were almost
a grandmother.
 Two months ago,
I lost a child.
 I know my loss is common,
but with you here
 I want so badly for my womb
to be able to carry.
 I lost four babies
before their births,
 two before Louis
came out alive.
 Many of us begin motherhood
with miscarriage.
 Pregnancy is a feat,
darlin'.
 Children are blessings,
 but also a part of you
that's gone forever.
 The things I never dreamed
would happen
 between my first baby
and today.
 There's all sorts of unexpected
ahead of you.
 I'm gonna see
if this oven's hot.
 "I took by the throat
 the circumcised dog
and smote him thus.
 Signed Benjamin Bartlett."
 Sounds more like Shakespeare.
 Othello's suicide speech,
in fact.
 A fella named hello
gives a goodbye speech?
 You may finally be getting
a sense of humor.
 A good detective
or captain
 educates himself
in all culture
 so he may be fluent
in any crime.
 Edwin Booth is scheduled
to play the title role
 in Oth-hello
 at the winter garden
next month.
 I'll get you a ticket.
 So Benjamin kills himself
 and admits to murdering
his father.
 We know that
because this Othello killed his?
 No, the moor killed his wife.
 He believed her unfaithful,
 although she had just misplaced
a handkerchief.
 Benjamin seemed
genuinely surprised
 to learn of his father's death.
 - Ah...
- Don't be naive.
 Every guilty man's
most rehearsed expression
 is disbelief.
 And you do cling to cases
 like a swooning debutante
to her folding fan,
 and nearly as emotional.
 I heard about the
scene at the Bartlett mansion.
 On the spectrum
of humanity,
 let's move toward urban man
 and away from pillaging viking,
shall we?
 But what is life
if we do not have improvements...
 ...to which to aspire to?
 To approaching grace.
 Slainte.
 Spring certainly has inspired
Five Points.
 I carry another child?
 Yes.
 Kevin has left
our home.
 I had heard such,
but that doesn't mean--
 Has he taken up
at the whorehouse?
 Ellen...
 It is not my position
to sort this out.
 I think you know
what you need to do.
 Go find him.
Find a way to talk to him.
 I would very much
like to commend the detectives
 of the sixth precinct
for their commitment to order,
 especially on this,
a national day of celebration.
 From tragic suicide
and murder,
 we move forward to a better
and more ordered community.
 Of course,
our thoughts and prayers
 are with the Bartlett family
and friends.
 Anything else, gentlemen?
 Do you have any
motive why Benjamin Bartlett....
 Feels good to
close a case with you again.
 We solved the
case from some poetry?
 It makes the bosses happy.
 What about the
stuff you can touch?
 The evidence?
 You know what
touches me? A stiff drink.
 Eva's got me roughing
copperheads for a room tonight.
 Come 'round.
 Save me from some
inauguration idiots, will ya?
 There's a wife and a mistress
unaccounted for,
 a mansion with no staff
of any kind,
 and a murderer
who supposedly destroys
 his most prized possession
to build his murder weapon.
 This case isn't done.
 I asked Sullivan
about Annie.
 He didn't lie.
 Kevin, some things
this city just swallows.
 Come to Eva's.
 Toastin' a beginnin'
might do you some good.
 Francis?
 Ellen,
Why are you here?
 "They said Kennedy shall
be hung by the neck until he be dead,
 at such time and place
as the commanding general
 may direct."
 Per our agreement,
I did not testify against you.
 As you claim to be
a man of honor,
 I entrust that you will keep
your end of the bargain.
 Knowledge of Elizabeth's
involvement
 will end with your death.
 Oh, Robert,
 your cleverness has always
lacked a certain vision,
 hasn't it?
 Such leaps in logic.
 How could I possibly accuse
your wife
 when I, myself,
am innocent?
 Do you think your choices
will not haunt you?
 This silence...
 ...makes me mad.
 This silence...
 ...it isn't silence.
 It fills me.
 Christ,
I've missed you.
 I can't, Francis!
I can't! We can't!
 We shouldn't make
the same mistakes.
 Mistakes?
 I'm your ear
because...
 ...you want to say
to my face
 I'm a mistake?
 You thought of me
 because I'm a glaring,
overwhelming mistake?
 I need life back, Francis,
real life.
 Don't treat me
like a fool who invented a world.
 What we had...
 I'm talking about return
to real living,
 not sitting at home
 feeling like something
has crawled into my heart.
 - Ellen--
- I can't take a full breath!
 You wonder why you feel
half alive?
 You spend your days
pining after a man
 who will never
forgive ya!
 A man who despises you
to his very core!
 You want to play the role
of doting wife?
 Go right ahead!
 But don't you dare insult me
 by acting like
what we had wasn't good,
 won't be forever
a part of ya!
 Don't disrespect our child
like that!
 Our child would be
six months old now.
 Do you count
his birthdays?
 Not just the months,
but the mornings?
 Do you wake up thinkin'
of his wee hands so fiercely
 that you look down expecting
to be holding a soft thing,
 all love and need?
 Eyes of your green,
 hair of me brown.
 If you had of chosen me,
 I never woulda left you.
 Remember that...
 ...in the middle of the night
as you lie in bed alone.
 "Dearest daughter,
 your father and I worry so
about you.
 He's convinced the city
of New York is devoid of God.
 Things are hard here,
but I've managed to put aside
 these five dollars to help you.
 It pains us not to have word.
Please write.
 Your loving mother."
 Behold the chief
who now commands
 Once more to serve
his country stands...
 Donovan!
 Corky, I need to talk to you.
 Just for a moment.
 I can't.
 Hey, Donovan,
 about the Bartlett case--
 When I was on the force,
 I used to love cases
like the Bartletts.
 Wrap 'em up,
 get down to the pub
for a wee one on the way home.
 But something tells me
you are not as pleased.
 The solution
was too easy.
 Sometimes crimes
are just that easy,
 turning on base human nature
and nothing more.
 Sometimes you have to learn
to accept
 the animal inside of us.
 Hmm?
Respect the opportunity
 to move on towards
the more evolved.
 Rallying around our liberty...
 I'm certain
the Alderman's farm girl
 knows exactly what happened
in that room,
 and if Teresa Trembley
doesn't know why it happened
 I can find out.
 Okay, now I understand,
I understand.
 You see the full story.
 Clean might be comforting,
 but you really think,
in solving these cases,
 it explains why happenstance
seizes hold of our lives.
 You, Kevin Corcoran,
 think the full story helps us
solve ourselves.
 And while I rarely share
your precise incentive,
 I am always fascinated
by your dedication.
 Thank you, sir.
 With equal skill
 With God-like power
he governs in the fearful...
 We rarely imbibe,
but this is the rarest of days.
 To you,
 here, safe.
 To this fine home.
 And to Lincoln,
for what he has done
 and what he will do.
 When the president
first took office,
 I realized real pride,
 national belonging
could rise in my chest.
 I felt connected
to this country
 as to a grand being.
 Unfortunately,
that grand being
 was more comfortable
with you as a slave,
 and you still aren't allowed
to elect your fair hero.
 Well, Lincoln is a champion
of education,
 land for the poor,
 and I believe,
in the end,
 true emancipation.
 We will have
the right to vote.
 Well, I don't trust
a white man's good intentions
 until they're gone so far
he can't undo 'em.
 Woo hoo-hoo!
 Are we certain
that they celebratin'?
 With the Irish,
sometimes celebration and riot
 are notes of the same song.
 "With high hope for the future
 no prediction in regard to it
is ventured."
 "On the occasion corresponding
to this four years ago,
 all thoughts
were anxiously directed
 to an impending civil war.
 Insurgent agents
were in the city
 seeking to destroy it
without war,
 Seeking to dissolve the union.
 Neither party expected
for the war,
 The magnitude or the duration
which it has already attained.
 Each looked
for an easier triumph
 and a result less fundamental
and less astounding."
 And so he says:
"With charity for all;
 with firmness in the right..."
 I need to use
your telegraph machine to Ontario,
 police business.
 Happy inauguration
to you too, Corky.
 The system's been
overwhelmed,
 but now the address
has come through,
 everyone seems to be
feting our leader,
 have a go.
 This will be sent
to the family of Teresa Trembley.
 Now where was I?
 "Let us strive on
to finish the work we are in;
 to bind up the nation's wounds;
 to care for him
who shall have borne the battle,
 and for his widow
and his orphan;
 to do all which may achieve
and cherish
 a just and lasting peace."
 To peace.
 Peace. Peace.
 And to Lincoln.
 And to Lincoln.
To Lincoln.
