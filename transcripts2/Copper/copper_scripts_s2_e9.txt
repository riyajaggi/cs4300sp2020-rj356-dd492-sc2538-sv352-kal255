 We have a man dead...
Alderman Stephen Bartlett.
 I'm certain the
Alderman's farm girl
 knows exactly what happened
in that room,
 and if Teresa Trembley
doesn't know why it happened,
 I can find out.
 This will be sent to the family
of Teresa Trembley.
 The world will know the
loss of Hazel Turner.
 You will not get
the aqueduct project
 unless you get Lansing
to withdraw his bid.
 I can adjust
my negotiation style.
 Who's that?!
 The Angel of
Darkness, you orange bastard.
 You got two choices:
 You can sign this paper now...
 ...or I turn you into
a flaming scarecrow.
 I loved Ellen
and I love you too,
 more than any brother
I ever could have had.
 Okay.
 - You got him?
- Mm-hmm.
 Let's set him over there.
 Mmm.
 Grab this arm.
 Got him?
 He's alive.
 Freeman, I know the
difference between dead and drunk.
 Kevin. Kevin?
 Stand back.
 Goddamnit!
 You let me be.
 Mmm, we fought
together on the battlefield,
 we're not letting you
fight this war on your own.
 What about a mourning period?
A few days at least.
 Ellen's wake
was two weeks ago.
 No, no, that's not true.
 Today is March 30th.
 It can't be.
 Ellen killed herself.
 My wife...
 I found her.
 And then you put her
to rest.
 For you,
the real escape is living.
 Welcome back.
 I like my bitches tight
 Even better without sight
 Screw 'em blind,
they don't mind
 'cause Jack-o's
king of the night
 I gotta take a piss.
 Hey, take one of these
whores with you, Jenkins.
 They'll aim it for ya;
that's what they're good for!
 Another. Two.
 I like my barkeeps
to be quicker
 than their tenement rats.
 You think I come here
for the crystal?
 He's useless!
 Hey, girlie, girlie,
hi there.
 Get me another drink,
girlie.
 There's no need for that.
 - Yeah?
- Agh! Jackass!
 Agh! You lazy slut!
 - Agh!
- That's it!
 Richie, toss him.
 Are you okay?
 Sir, I would really
appreciate it if--
 Hey!
I would rather stay.
 Ungh!
 Agh!
 Agghhh!
 Oh! Agghhh!
 Oh my God.
 Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!
 Agh!
 Agh! Agh! Agghhhh!
 Agh! Aghhh! Agghhhh!
 I didn't realize you were up.
 Work don't stop
'cause the sun set.
 And look at you,
pulling that nightgown
 like I have never seen
your naked butt.
 Momma!
 Oh, calm.
 Now I would have said
the same thing yesterday,
 before I walked in
on you and Matthew.
 Don't you ever tell
my husband that you saw...
 Oh Lord, I can't believe
I'm having this conversation.
 - Momma!
- What?!
 Promise me.
 You always were nervous
about your body.
 What you ashamed of,
girl?
 Nothin'.
 Night, momma.
 Night.
 I know it's late, sir,
and I know how busy you are,
 so I do apologize for...
for keeping ya.
 Please, sit.
My office is always open
 for the pressing concerns
of my constituents.
 My wife here,
her brother, Seamus Walsh,
 he's been in the tombs
since he got mixed up
 in the whole precinct's debacle.
 We just hoped
that you might--
 You say you've got power.
 Well, Seamus is
a damn good fella,
 better than you even,
from what I hear.
 General,
she don't mean that, she--
 If you don't have the grit
to stand up for your family,
 then someone has to.
 My brother has talent
and spirit,
 which is being wasted
in those blasted tombs.
 From what I hear,
your brother is a dolt.
 Sure, maybe he falls
into the coop
 when he's stealing
chickens.
 But, even as a kid,
 he always put meat
on our table.
 When I'm trying to free
a prisoner, Sybil,
 I usually avoid naming
more crimes.
 What's behind
the action matters,
 and Seamus' intent
has never been criminal.
 My, my, my, how you
remind me of my first love.
 Same persuasive spark.
 In honor of that
long lost young lady,
 I will let Seamus walk.
 Why thank you,
General Donovan.
 With a caveat,
 for ours is not a heaven
from which gifts rain.
 The lads are digging
new sewer line Uptown.
 If Seamus can hold his own
in a mucking gang,
 he avoids prison.
 The first day of work
he misses
 is the day he begins
his sentence at Sing Sing.
 Thank you, sir.
Go on.
 Thank you.
 Lazarus returns.
 It seems in
two weeks, nothing changes.
 Are you truly ready
to face the blood and guts?
 Some things a man was born for,
like policing with this force.
 Well, we do need you.
 Hey, what the hell?
 Just following orders, detective.
 Your friend is headed
to the tombs
 under arrest
for attempted murder.
 Eva, what happened?
 A man beat Lola,
 so I stabbed him
in the eye.
 Please.
 I know your mother.
 Yes, the carriage, please.
 Hey, Glynn,
talk to the warden.
 I want her
in the governor's cell.
 I don't need a damn cell!
 You all act like no one
has ever given a drunk
 what he's asked for.
 Donovan will know a way
to get you released.
 I'll come to see you
after I talk to him.
 This way.
Come on, get in.
 In the evenings,
 I'm reminded of Thomas,
how quietly he moved.
 As a child,
when the day was done,
 he liked to lay down
in the grass
 and feel the heat of the day
leave the earth.
 We were always waiting
for the moon to rise.
 That was his way
of pretending us free.
 Oh, that boy...
 He started and ended
every day with hope.
 Momma, tomorrow,
when we go to the butcher,
 I want you to remind me--
 Sara...
 Tell me
what Thomas was like
 in this city.
 That was years ago now.
 Just tell me
what it was like
 the last morning
he was alive.
 I don't know.
 I'm sure we moved through
our usual routine.
 You do remember,
 and the memories
are not yours to keep.
 You just want to hurry forward
with this new life,
 but sharing memories,
 that keeps Louis and Thomas
alive for us.
 Get out! It's our block!
 You're goddamn right!
 A house is burnin'.
 A home is on fire!
 Only one company
gets paid for the work,
 they're just
sorting out who.
 Why is everybody in this city
so violent?!
 Would you neighbors ever see
each other as human beings?!
 You can't involve
yourself
 in every single problem here,
momma.
 Come on, this way.
 Are you going to stoke
that fire?
 I was just thinking about
those flames
 taking everything
from them people.
 Tammany Hall will get them
a new place.
 The Irish take care
of their own.
 You really rise
this early every day?
 In Five Points,
the only opportunity
 for uninterrupted research
is dawn,
 which leads me
to the purpose...
 Oh, I'd offer you
a taste,
 but I know you'd give me
that withering look.
 I have traced a disease
 sweeping through
the Leonard Street tenement
 to a dirty well.
 Curing the stricken
has been nearly impossible,
 but if the source
were to be...
 I'll check the records,
 but I doubt
the Morehouse estate
 owns a tenement.
 Oh, my aim is greater
than this building alone.
 I have written a tract...
 Which identifies
all the water sources
 within Five Points
 at risk of contamination,
 along with recommendations
for the future.
 I want the tract
published,
 but no one will accept
the findings of a black man,
 which demonstrates
that northern freedom
 is no absolute.
 That I can't help with,
 but if you were to publish
 under the pseudonym
of a white man...
 Certainly the provost
at my alma mater knows a doctor
 both reputable and agreeable.
 Yes.
 Let's change lives.
 If Ramsey lives
we'll let the dusk settle,
 and I can assure you'll walk.
 If he dies?
 A turn of events,
 which would complicate
your situation.
 Liquored men die everyday,
 by their own hands
or plenty of others.
 You're forgetting
Ramsey isn't your ordinary
 Five Points ruffian.
 He's of Greenwich Village,
 and those citizens love
vocalizing their importance.
 What am I supposed to do now?
Here?
 We Catholics have a thing
called a retreat.
 Not like a retreat
in battle,
 but a renewal of the soul.
 Use your time here
to reflect.
 Let us work on your behalf.
 I'm not used to being
at someone else's mercy.
 I'll have
Freeman check on Ramsey.
 We'll plan
for either scenario.
 Even if he lives,
I have a feeling I'll hang.
 This city,
when minds are set...
 There's been no public outcry,
all right?
 Hanging me also hangs my child,
Corky.
 Look...
 You and your child,
you're safe.
 I promise to get you
outta here.
 After speaking to Freeman,
stop by The Paradise.
 I want Lola in charge,
every penny, every prick,
 and tell her to keep
an eye on Richie.
 I think he's started
stealing from the till.
 In this marriage,
the two really have become one.
 Can you outpace him yet?
 Please remember
you wouldn't be in this room
 if it weren't for me,
Norbert.
 Do tell, what fresh hell is this?
 A personal project,
 none of your business
responsibility.
 "The abominable
quality of downtown water...
 runoff and waste
causing grievous conditions..."
 This doesn't concern you!
 "We demand the
responsibility for portable water
 fall to each well's
neighboring corporations,
 with failure to comply
resulting in fines,
 and, if necessary,
forced closures."
 I assume you are among the "we"
in question?
 Are you aware another "we,"
you and I,
 own half the corporations
below 14th street?
 Today's business lesson:
 One does not levy fines
upon oneself!
 Business,
and all its related lessons,
 are done for the day.
 I am sure you have
somewhere else to be.
 The fool thinks
I can be outpaced.
 I embrace the challenge.
 Detective, drink?
 No, I'm here on business.
 I'll take a short one.
 Christ, Lola,
you look like you were bobbin'
 when you should
have been weavin'.
 I wish I'd shot that animal
before Eva had to stab him.
 Was Ramsey going
after her before she stabbed him?
 He got what was due,
if that's what you mean.
 Well, emotions aside,
 I'm trying to make a case
for self-defense.
 What do you think
I'm gonna say, detective?
 Eva Heissen is more
than just my boss.
 You too, Richie?
 Eva didn't have a choice.
 Let's not forget,
the knife was Ramsey's.
 And how many other witnesses
will back you up
 that don't work for Eva?
 I'd say a dozen or more.
 Any other than the regulars?
 Out-of-towners maybe?
 Any gonna back Ramsey?
 His cousin,
um...
 Jenkins something...
Paul, was here.
 Let me guess,
 He hightailed
when the trouble started?
 He's a souse.
 Squanders his family's money
all over downtown.
 Could I have
a word with Lola?
 Eva says
she wants you in charge,
 and keep an eye
on your barkeep.
 Sure.
 I'll keep the place spinning
like a child's top.
 Any problems,
 you need any help
of any kind,
 just yell.
 I can think of a thing
or two.
 Think of something else.
 Old Pepper has
always been my favorite,
 though Robert does harbor
a weakness
 for Halpenny bourbon whiskey.
 If I may suggest,
 given the quantity
of consumption,
 A.M. Bininger & Company
sells in bulk.
 Actually, why
should we be forced to choose?
 Order them all.
 A full case of each?
Are you expecting a siege?
 Oh, loosen up, James.
 Here you go.
 Why don't you taste,
see which one you prefer?
 I appreciate the offer,
ma'am,
 but I do not imbibe
while at work.
 How charming.
 Ramsay lost an
enormous amount of blood
 and will certainly lose sight
in the injured eye,
 however, the wound did not
penetrate deeply into the brain.
 Will he live?
 Yes.
 There's always risk
of side effects,
 secondary trauma.
 Hey, breathing's
good enough for me.
 Now to tell Eva the good news.
Thank you!
 Excuse me, is there--
 Sorry, I'm on police business.
 Hey, Maguire!
 Ah.
 Go on,
be on your way anyway.
 What brings such a pretty face
down to this dump?
 I'm looking for
a Detective Corcoran.
 Why's that?
 He sent my parents
a telegram
 regarding a murder
that I witnessed.
 And what do you call
yourself then?
 My name's
Teresa Trembley.
 Tare an'ouns.
 I watched
Alderman Bartlett die.
 The man who killed him
had already gagged me
 and then he was...
 If you saw the murderer
again, could you identify him?
 Yes, I will never forget
that man's face.
 As the Alderman died,
he looked me in the eye
 and he told me
I was next.
 And, my dear,
how did you avoid being such?
 I gave the wall
a kicking.
 My neighbor, Mab O'Dwyer,
she... hates any racket.
 She threatened to come over
and silence the noise.
 As the man approached me,
Mab's door opened.
 The murderer
must have panicked.
 He ran.
 Right away, I locked the door,
I packed a few things,
 and... I fled.
 I'll let Kevin know
the case has been reopened.
 Detective Corcoran
has enough trouble
 to sort at the moment.
 I trust you can handle
this lead on your own.
 Arrange for Teresa's hiding...
now.
 Major.
 First, I would like
to emphasize
 that I am proceeding
with the plan.
 Though second,
 my father has destroyed
your document.
 Why was your father
in possession of my work?
 I'm meeting
with Doctor Wells,
 Chief Medical Officer
at Columbia College,
 this afternoon.
 But you have nothing
to show him.
 Then draft a new paper.
 I'll convince Wells
of our objective.
 He is ambitious.
 And when he agrees,
 I will hand the new papers
directly to him,
 and your words
will reach the public.
 But if this Doctor Wells
is as reputable as you claim,
 he won't trust a verbal report
from a businessman.
 Then get writing.
 We're going to make
a mark on history.
 And this time,
script two copies.
 Donovan doesn't
make false promises.
 Tenements all looking
the same gives me the creeps.
 I feel like I'm back
in my old room.
 Ah, this is no room.
 This is a palace.
 Because you, Teresa,
are a queen.
 Your throne.
 Donovan began
like us, you know.
 He immigrated and found
his place in the city,
 climbed his way
to the top.
 Well, if not the top,
the near top.
 I don't know
that I could climb anywhere.
 I'm not even sure
I knew what I wanted
 coming to New York
from Hamilton.
 Well, that's what makes
this city special...
 you don't need to know
up front.
 I was promised
a lot of things
 by Alderman Bartlett.
 In the end,
all he left me with was fear
 and that image of his death.
 I don't think there's much
of a future for me here.
 Right...
 But look at Donovan.
 He had to quit the coppers
 because his contracting business
was so successful,
 then Tammany noticed,
and all these things,
 one after the other.
 But he started
with a dirt floor,
 knowing only
he wanted more than dirt.
 Here's the truth:
 Greatness starts with...
everyday boring stuff.
 It's how you approach
it that matters.
 Well, maybe I've finally
met the right people.
 Ah, I see you have some pepper
back in your step, detective.
 I stopped by The Paradise
and talked to some witnesses.
 Eva's got a pretty strong claim
of self-defense.
 Ramsey pulled the knife.
 He was a train wreck,
smacked one of Eva's girls.
 Ah yes, the dusky young Lola.
 At least we've got
cause to free her on bail.
 I thought I had made myself
perfectly clear
 at the tombs,
detective,
 but obviously not clear enough.
 I get this Ramsay isn't some
anonymous guttersnipe, but we--
 It's a mayoral
election year, Corcoran,
 in case you haven't noticed.
 So every two years
rich assholes get a pass?
 I think by now you know me
better than that, Kevin.
 Eva's a businesswoman.
 She kicks a lot of money
up the chain.
 She's a friend,
and more.
 I understand that, Kevin,
I really do,
 but please show some patience.
 We rescue her together.
 My doctor friend says
Ramsay's sure to live.
 Well, there you have it.
 A glimmer
of perpetual light.
 Throw it over here.
 You are gonna be
bossing those girls around in no time.
 How certain was Freeman?
 Matthew always plays careful,
especially with diagnosis.
 Ramsay, the blind bastard...
 ...will survive.
 Guard!
 And so we live on.
 Yeah.
 Corcoran, out.
 I need a word with
Miss Heissen alone.
 If it's anything
to do with her case,
 I'm not going anywhere.
 You've already
stuck your nose in enough.
 Captain,
I'd prefer Kevin stay.
 Jack Ramsay died.
 Found in his bed
at Saint Vincent's.
 I'm sorry, Eva,
you'll be prosecuted for murder.
 No, he can't be dead.
 So go to the hospital
and talk him out of it.
 They'll be calling
a grand jury post haste.
 But you said...
 In the army,
we always have a second plan.
 We'll start organizing
your defense.
 I'm just another Five Points
immigrant in the tombs...
 ...disposable.
 No.
 Your friends will
fight for ya.
 I'll fight for ya.
 I consider myself a survivor,
someone who acts,
 but within these walls
there's no action to take!
 Ramsey was the instigator.
 We'll bury the grand jury
with witnesses.
 Kevin, I've been around
New York long enough to know
 the truth rarely
wins the day.
 Fixing this is my job,
Eva.
 I can't...
 That's okay.
 It's okay. It's okay,
just, just be here...
 Just allow it.
Oh yeah...
 Oh, oh...
 These are deeds to
properties in the aqueduct's right of way.
 Organize my presentation.
 I'm off to officially
register my bid
 in advance of tomorrow's
council vote.
 Everything will be waiting
on your desk
 when you get back
from the meeting.
 And, uh, good luck,
sir.
 Luck? I hope we've obviated
the need
 for the whims of fortune.
 Not the desk,
the lock box.
 These documents will
determine our future
 in more ways than one.
 To Governor Reuben Fenton.
 I like that name, Reuben.
 Is it true
you frolicked with Mary Todd?
 Full stop.
 No?
Exclamation, exclamation.
 Excuse me.
 You are not Governor Reuben.
 Or the odd Mary Todd.
 Are you a new friend?
 I've decided
to collect them again.
 This must be
the wrong residence.
 The butler should not
have allowed me through.
 Ah!
 Elizabeth...
Doctor Wells.
 This inebriate
is your wife?
 She...
 Doctor, come with me
to my parlor.
 I wasn't aware...
 From this lack of decorum, sir,
 I trust nothing,
much less a medical tract.
 I have never encountered
such brazen indecency.
 Sir!
 That doctor was
my only remaining channel
 for publishing Freeman's study.
 What in God's name
are you doing?
 I want to dance,
Robert!
 I want to dance!
 You keep up the act,
 invitations will
surely dry up.
 Now please...
 I don't want some
boring uptown stodgy soiree.
 Something dark,
something downtown.
 You can't even begin
to fathom
 the darkness of downtown.
 Take me, Robert.
 Hold me.
 Oh, wait, I need some stuff.
I'm gonna make a stew.
 Let's see if everything
is fresh.
 Buy what you touch
or move on.
 We're just finding
the best.
 My momma's a fine cook.
 Let me see...
 I said, get yer soiled hands
outta my goods!
 There's disease everywhere!
 That man is a doctor.
 He will tell you
what is a disease.
 What kind of a world
do you think this is, mammy...
 ...where a nigger can tell me
what's what?
 I don't know what kind of world
this is, Mister!
 Let's move on,
momma.
 This was a damn nice
city 'til you people showed up!
 Cost both my brothers
their jobs.
 You're worse
than the Irish!
 Their jobs?
 Maybe they should have
worked harder!
 Momma, come on.
 Okay, that's enough.
 Matthew, no!
 You speak
to my family again
 and I will put
your thick head
 through that window.
 Matthew!
 Let him go.
 Please.
 Momma, come on.
 You have no idea
the people I know.
 Come on now.
 Matthew!
 Come on!
 I'll speak to your filthy women
whenever I want!
 - And if I want...
- Matthew!
 I'll burn them!
 I'll burn them all!
 They're all the same.
 As for the
business of the proposed aqueduct,
 all final bids
must be delivered here,
 City Hall,
by midnight tomorrow.
 At the public works meeting
next week,
 we will vote on
the winning bid.
 Construction on this project
is scheduled to commence
 the first of May.
 We now close this meeting
with a moment of silence
 for the late Alderman,
Stephen Bartlett.
 Thank you
for supporting my proposal.
 Has there been any sign
of Lansing?
 Like a sparrow in winter,
gone.
 Perhaps he finally
realized
 he's no competition
for me after all.
 I bet not.
 Why?
 He sent an associate
to register his bid
 for tomorrow's vote.
 Ah, well, then,
may the best man win.
 I took a risk backing
your plan, Donovan.
 I hope that decision
does not come
 to cause me embarrassment.
 May our departed
colleague rest in peace.
 This meeting is concluded.
 Freeman visited
Jack Ramsay just before his death.
 He said he would live.
 We don't get a say,
I guess. Death comes knockin',
 no use trying to step out
the back door.
 Doesn't seem like death
was knocking for Ramsey though.
 Life's been giving us
shite hands, Corky,
 but Eva's a tough gal.
She'll come out all right.
 Thanks, buck.
 Remember when
The Paradise opened?
 Yeah, right before the war.
 Seems like we were kids
back then.
 Ah, we were.
 She's always been there
for us...
 ...a drink,
a room, an ear.
 There's no way
I'll let Eva hang.
 Kevin, just promise me
you do this smart.
 Do what?
 Whatever the hell
you're planning to do.
 Well...
 I've learned from
General Donovan, haven't I?
 Come on,
I want to check on Eva's.
 Me and Glynn already
stopped in. No sign of Jenkins.
 I want to make
sure Lola's faring okay.
 All right.
 I gotta drop this meat off
at home,
 then I'll catch up
with ya.
 Great.
 What were you like as a girl?
 Like anyone, I suppose.
 Dreaming of a husband,
praying I'd turn out pretty.
 Elizabeth, I don't believe that
for a moment.
 Please, I'd like to know
how the woman I love came to be.
 My youth wasn't easy.
 Meaning...?
 Was your father cruel?
 No, no, nothing like that.
He was a good man.
 Just with five daughters
when he had more use for a son.
 Why are you suddenly
so interested in my youth?
 I feel we are formed
into stone early in life.
 I think moving forward
we should indulge less.
 Robert,
don't be silly.
 It's all fun,
 but today you cost
a friend of mine,
 of ours,
 something very dear
to him.
 A little incident...
 A joke, Robert,
that went awry.
 I meant no harm,
truly.
 I know I introduced you
to the opium,
 so I deserve blame.
 I like the way
it makes me feel,
 the peace it brings
my turbulent mind.
 Let's just take a vacation
from the stuff, shall we?
 Wait...
 At least let me have
a last little drop.
 Fine.
 But after this night,
 we pursue different recreations
for a while.
 After the vote is held
we need to get hiring lists drawn up.
 Let's fill as many of the spots
as we can with sixth wards.
 After that, Tammany will give us
lists for the other wards.
 Well, Orrin Lansing,
you want the gloves to come off,
 then so be it.
 Summon Detective Maguire
immediately.
 Contact Mister O'Malley
at the funeral home.
 I'll draft a letter
to Mister O'Hearn's parents.
 You came back
to have fun
 or are you still
working?
 I came for a long
overdue drink.
 Hey.
 I went to Donohue's on Mulberry
to borrow some bitters
 and that jackass Jenkins
was drinkin' there.
 You and I both know
this city demands
 a certain level of humility
and patience.
 Do you remember
our adjustment?
 New rules,
unfamiliar norms,
 with a multitude
of sounds and smells
 distracting us
from any real understanding.
 These past few weeks,
Hattie has become more unhappy
 and less accommodating.
 She is not progressing.
 Momma's older
and stubborn.
 The way she conducts herself
in this community,
 it reflects back on us.
 The man who attacked
that shopkeeper
 is not the man
I want to be.
 Remember that she only
just learned her sons died.
 And what happens
when she learns the truth
 of those deaths?
 Will we have to...
endure this adjustment
 all over again?
 Hey.
 I take it the guy
in the fancy suit is Jenkins?
 Might be. He's the only
one here I don't know by name.
 I'll take a bottle.
 You're from Greenwich Village.
Jenkins, right?
 Who wants to know?
 Just trying to be friendly.
 Nobody in this city is ever
just trying to be friendly.
 Well...
 Ooh, I am unimpressed.
 I want to make sure
we get justice for your cousin.
 Well, I heard that whore
got locked up
 and is gonna hang
for killing Jack.
 She will indeed,
only...
 Did your cousin have anything
to do with what happened?
 Did he provoke
the stabbing?
 Who cares about a whore?
 Nobody.
 I need to make sure
our prosecutor
 has a solid case
to argue.
 Yeah, I remember
when that little sausage eater
 was new in town.
 Me and six of my friends,
 we took her one night
on my cousin's boat,
 passed her around
like a bottle of cheap booze.
 You know, she is as nasty
a little whore
 as ever walked
this city's streets,
 and I'm gonna piss
on her grave
 for what she did
to my cousin.
 Agh! Aggghhhh!
 Jesus, Kevin!
 You're gonna kill him!
That's enough!
 This is how you
do things smart, huh?
 Let's go. Go!
 I don't need a noose;
this cell will kill me first.
 How am I supposed to organize
a defense from in here?
 The truth of the justice system
is the prisoner has no agency,
 but you, my dear,
have friends such as myself.
 I keep hearing that.
 I want to see it
to believe it.
 And yet you must.
 I'll investigate
your options tomorrow.
 I hope you realize how tricky
this whole scenario is.
 It's trickier
than even you think.
 Huh. How so?
 The baby I carry is yours.
 Lucky you.
 You'll have a fine specimen
to continue your legacy of wile,
 and my stature
is something of a badge.
 What about the public?
The Tammany won't--
 Careful now,
 I have a lot
of enemies.
 If they hear
you carry my child,
 they might be inspired
to target you.
 Shh...
 Thank you for coming
 and for your discretion
in this matter.
 As discussed,
you're here to assess
 the new addition
to the solarium.
 Oh, is that all
I get to assess?
 I'm not here
for your entertainment.
 Uh, well, maybe not,
but, uh,
 you rich ladies certainly
can be amusing.
 - Ah!
- Let me have it.
 This comes straight
from the Chinaman on Mott.
 You'll find this
a little more exciting
 than your husband's strain,
I think.
 When in need of more,
 you now know how
to reach me.
 Show yourself out.
 Mister Maguire,
did you get my files back?
 I did.
 And did Mister Lansing apologize
 for what he done
to young Milo O'Hearn?
 Profusely.
 And lastly,
Mister Maguire,
 did you explain
to Mister Lansing
 that his regrets
came too late?
 I did.
 With pleasure.
 Proceed.
 No!
 No!
 Hush, Mr. Lansing,
it'll be over soon.
 Agghhhh!
 Agghhhhh!
 No! No!
