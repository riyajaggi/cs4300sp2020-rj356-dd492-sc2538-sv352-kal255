 Agh!
 Jack Ramsay died.
I'm sorry, Eva,
 you'll be prosecuted
for murder.
 I have written a tract
which identifies
 all the water sources
within Five Points
 at risk of contamination.
 You'll find this
a little more exciting
 than your husband's strain,
I think.
 I'm looking for
a Detective Corcoran.
 My name's
Teresa Trembley..
 Arrange for Teresa's
hiding, now.
 Remember that she only
just learned her sons died.
 And what happens
when she learns
 the truth
of those deaths?
 Did you explain
to Mister Lansing
 that his regrets came
too late?
 I did, with pleasure.
 Proceed.
 You want the gloves
to come off,
 then so be it.
 Christ the Lord is risen today
 Alleluia
 Earth and heaven
in chorus say,
 Alleluia.
 Episcopal hymns.
 Sound like swine being
led to a slaughter.
 Simply awful.
 Captain, your men will shutter
Eva's Paradise tonight.
 Yes, sir.
 Well, how is it gonna help Eva
if we close her business?
 She'll go broke.
 Once again you fail to see
 beyond the parameters
of Five Points.
 We are offering
those Greenwich Village bigots
 a sign of good faith.
 This is bigger
than one lowly immigrant.
 That lowly immigrant
made The Paradise home
 to half the sixth ward,
including you.
 Chain of command,
Corcoran.
 Jesus Christ almighty!
 I am sick and tired of your
saintly bullshit, Detective!
 Now either you get your lowly
immigrant arse in line
 and do as I say,
 or I have no further use
for ye!
 Why can't you pull rank
and get Eva out today?!
 He's a lawman who believes
in the law
 until it affects him.
 "Pull rank" you say,
hmm?
 We will exonerate Miss Heissen
by legal means.
 She's going to need capital
to afford a proper lawyer.
 And I plan on securing both.
 Do you not trust me,
Kevin Corcoran?
 I was gonna ask you
the same question.
 Hey.
 He was snoring,
 always snoring,
sleeping on his side.
 So I took a ten penny nail
 and I swung the hammer
hard as I could.
 So here I sit,
waiting to hang.
 Sure gives ya time
to think, no?
 Miss Heissen?
 J.E. Lovrich,
attorney and savior.
 A man of contradictions.
 As amusing as your quips
might be,
 my time is short.
 I come to you
with an offer:
 Five thousand dollars
and I'll take your case.
 Five thousand dollars?
 Yes.
 Mister uh...
 - Lovrich.
- Lovrich.
 I don't have
that kind of money.
 If you wish to afford
my services,
 Mister Sutton,
rising real estate investor,
 holds the key.
 You'll see that
I have calculated all assets
 and all aspects of your saloon,
Miss Heissen.
 With due respect,
my offer is firm.
 I will not negotiate.
 You're asking me to sell
The Paradise.
 Everything I own?!
 Madam, our professions
are not all that different.
 Good service
does not come cheap.
 How did you know
I was here?
 General Donovan insists
 that the queen of Five Points
remain atop of her throne
 and away from the gallows.
 Raise your joys
and triumphs high...
 How long can they go on for?
 To Lieutenant General Grant!
 Richmond has fallen!
 The end of the Confederacy
is near!
 Cheers!
 Police!
 We need everyone out, now!
 Everybody out!
 Go on!
 Close it up.
Keep movin'!
 What the hell's
goin' on here?
 Eva's Paradise
is closing up shop, Richie.
 Corky?
 Look, no questions,
just go.
 Where?
We live here.
 You'll sleep
at the precinct.
 - Get out!
- Let's go, top hat.
 On to Richmond!
 Isn't that what we Union men
used to say?
 Today, Richmond is ours.
 And you turn your back
on all yer brothers
 who fought and died
for this hour.
 You're all copper now.
 No Union corporal
would ever steal this night
 away from us.
 That's enough.
Move on.
 Al-le-lu-u-ia
 Mister Donovan's not here,
 but he should be back
momentarily
 if you'd like to sit?
 We'll wait in there.
 "Where
a malignant and a turbaned Turk
 beat a Venetian
and traduced the state,
 I took by the throat
the circumcised dog
 and smote him, thus."
 Who reads that shit?
 Sounds like someone
who don't speak english no good,
 or like that drabble
from the, uh,
 Bartlett kid's suicide note?
 No.
 No, I thought we were here
for Eva.
 Corky, just 'cause he's got
the same book
 as some dead rich kid
 don't mean Donovan's involved
in anything.
 No, it doesn't,
but I need you to go
 back down to the precinct,
 pull the Bartlett murder file
from storage.
 What are you gonna do?
 I'd like to talk to Donovan,
alone.
 Why do I get the feeling
you're about to make
 all of New York quake?
 Considering that
Mister Lansing has sent word
 that he has chosen to,
instead,
 commence construction on a dam
outside Buenos Aires,
 The only qualifying bid
that remains
 is that of
General Brendan Donovan.
 Gentlemen, please!
 We will reconvene
in two days time,
 at nine o'clock,
 at which time the board
will hold a final vote
 on the sole proposal.
 Congratulations,
General.
 Thank you, sir.
 Congratulations,
General Donovan.
 Sisyphus of Five Points
may make his way
 to the mountaintop
after all.
 Thank you,
Mister Morehouse,
 I'm a firm believer
that a contract is not closed
 until signed.
 Alderman Stonington wishes
to meet with you privately.
 I do suggest that,
for the good of your proposal,
 you take the man up
on his offer.
 Tomorrow night,
my home?
 Oh, you must mean
your son's home?
 What time shall
I arrive?
 Seven thirty
should be fine.
 Missus Morehouse!
Missus Morehouse!
 James, answer me this...
 What hangs at a man's thigh
 that wants to poke a hole
it's often poked before?
 Oh, I don't know.
 A key.
 Christ our Lord...
 What is
the use of this instrument?
 Called a cytoscope.
 Used to examine infections
in urine in the bladder.
 This goes inside a man's--
 Say what you
came here to say.
 I have failed you.
 Your medical tract,
I cannot publish it.
 Oh, Major.
 No.
 "Major" is a title reserved
for one who deserves respect.
 Robert,
 I am tired of you
and your uptown bullshit...
 the lies,
the deceptions,
 the broken promises
that your people--
 Do not generalize.
 Have I not been
charitable enough
 to pay for
your medical practice?
 And what of reuniting Sara
with her mother?
 Friendly acts, yes,
 eclipsed by greedy exploits
of the general public!
 I have tried.
I am still trying.
 Trying to do what?
 To become...
 ...something, someone who--
 Children and the elderly
are dying
 while you line your pockets
with cash!
 Now tell me,
 what are you buying
with that blood money?
 Another bottle of brandy?
A new suit?
 I sure as hell hope
it's worth the life of a child!
 Goddamn you, Freeman.
 This bandage was clean
when I first examined him.
 It's now stained with blood.
 Purple splotches on the face,
the eye is bloodshot.
 The other eye, if he had one,
would be the same.
 But it was
an open lesion,
 so the blood had
a way to escape.
 Through the stab wound,
hence the bloodstained bandage.
 What of the frothy spit
at his mouth?
 Same as the eyes
and face.
 When you abruptly cut off
a man's oxygen supply,
 this is the result.
 All telltale signs
of suffocation.
 Corky,
without evidence...
 Cut off a man's oxygen,
you say?
 Well, look at that
gleeful grin.
 What are you going on about?
 Momma.
 Well, if you must know,
I met someone.
 No, not like that.
 A man, though.
 His name is Tommy,
like your brother.
 Would you believe
he has been working for J.D.?
 The field hand?
 Except J.D. is not on
the plantation anymore.
 He living up north of here.
 Got a apple orchard
all his own.
 My Lord, good for him.
 Yes.
 I had the most curious moment,
Sara.
 It dawned on me:
 I was standing in the store
buying food...
 ...and nobody had sent me.
 I went there
on my own accord
 because I wanted flour,
I wanted rice.
 I remember that moment,
 except I had a bag of sugar
under my arm.
 You and your sweet tooth!
 I see you and Matthew,
 going about your life,
doing whatever you please.
 It's beautiful to watch.
I just...
 I'm unsure of what
to make of it all.
 You'll know soon enough.
 Tell me about
your new friend, Tommy.
 He says that up north of here
there's these skinny lakes...
 that they just stretch
for miles.
 And they call 'em
finger lakes,
 'cause they long and slender
like piano fingers.
 Look like they belong
to the hands of God.
 J.D. 's orchard is at the edge
of one of 'em!
 Lake, um, Canaga.
Wait, Lake...
 Canandaigua?
 See, that's it!
That's the one!
 Tommy goes up there
every summer,
 and then in the fall,
 him and J.D.,
they pick apples off the trees.
 "There's nothing like autumn
upstate New York," Tommy said.
 "October will break your heart.
 You never want
the days to end."
 Then he smiled,
 and offered me a job
to work!
 I had to laugh.
 A old woman like me
workin' the land
 for the first time.
 I said,
"I was in the house, Tommy."
 I would like to see
those beautiful leaves
 one day though.
 Ya settling in okay?
 I suppose so.
 I mean, I'm grateful
for all of this,
 I just never saw
anyone die before.
 Watching Alderman Bartlett,
 the struggle,
 him gasping,
convulsing, I...
 Just the images keep
circling in my mind.
 I can't make them stop.
 I'm sorry.
 Don't be.
 You've been goin' through
some tough times, Teresa.
 But you don't have to go
through them alone anymore.
 What is it?
 You remind me
of someone.
 Who's that?
 Just... from my past.
 Years ago in Ireland,
when I was a wee lad.
 And?
 It's only I haven't
thought about her in years.
 Do you miss her?
 I didn't 'til I met you.
 Line by line...
 The words match
Bartlett's suicide note.
 Hey, Glynn.
 Get these back down in storage,
would ya?
 Right away, detective.
 So Donovan and the Bartlett kid
liked the same lousy poetry.
 You have a lot more faith
in coincidence than I do.
 I gotta ask.
 Donovan has been
acting peculiar lately.
 Anything you can tell me
about your past together?
 The business,
the girls,
 whatever type of business
you two have on the side?
 Does he get his hands dirty
or does he...
 Does he hire outside
for that?
 Do you realize that I'm...
 I'm trying to help you,
right?
 Because from what I see,
 Donovan's assistance
only brings you losses.
 First, he shuts down
The Paradise,
 and then he wants you
to sell.
 He did what?
 He's the father,
isn't he?
 Corky... be careful.
 Donovan is not a man
to be trifled with.
 Schedule my carriage
for seven o'clock.
 I'll be going
to the Morehouse mansion
 on West 23rd Street.
 Yes, sir, Mister Donovan.
 Detective Corcoran. Hmm.
 Just the man
I was hoping to find.
 I was out of line yesterday,
hmm?
 The lads in the sixth precinct
hold you in such high esteem
 for the very characteristics
I criticized.
 Truth is,
you're a finer copper
 than I ever was.
 I was just noticing
your old badge.
 Hmm...
Some of my fondest days.
 I wanted to tell you,
I've been realizing
 that you were right all along
 about police work being easier
than I make it.
 In certain cases, yes,
but--
 The lines are clear:
 Black and white,
good and bad.
 We serve,
we bring the bad in for justice.
 It's simple.
Retribution for crime.
 Isn't that the most...
 ...satisfying part
of the job?
 The retribution?
 Absolutely.
 Y'see,
I'm still learning from you yet.
 I thought you just asked me
to formulate a lie.
 One which I will state
as fact,
 in order to scare
General Brendan Donovan
 because you have a hunch
he may be up to no good?
 What, you're gonna tell me
this is the first untruth
 you've told
to a higher rank?
 What if you're onto something,
Corky?
 Have you reached
the level of confidence
 at which you think you can
depose a Tammany ward boss?
 Just please do me
this favor?
 Don't worry about any fallout,
all right?
 And what of implicating me
into this scheme of yours?
 You are millionaire,
Major Robert Morehouse.
 Tammany Hall needs people
like you
 to keep the city afloat.
 Huh.
 Soon a new New York
for its new people.
 And what of this city's past?
 Men such as we
laid its foundations.
 You cannot change history.
 No, but I can control
its future.
 An Irish Napoleon
in our midst.
 Do remember,
General Donovan, as committee chair,
 I control when and if
the Aqueduct vote happens.
 The vote is to be
tomorrow morn.
 Yes, but first I need to meet
with my esteemed brother
 who runs a highly regarded
engineering firm.
 By any chance, is your brother
Kenneth Stonington?
 The very same.
 Uncanny.
 My research tells me
he's the best.
 I had no other in mind
 to which to offer
the engineering venture
 of the Aqueduct.
 I can only hope
your brother will accept.
 I'm certain
he'll be interested.
 Shall we take
a recess from business?
 The neighborhood is afire
with whispers
 of last month's scandal.
 Christ, which scandal?
 Seems the Bartlett family
is unsatisfied
 with the way the police
handled the deaths
 of Alderman Bartlett
and his son, Benjamin.
 They have gone as far as
to enlist the governor's office
 to reopen the investigation.
 Hmm.
 Sorry to bother you.
Matthew around?
 Well, he and Sara went out.
 Did he leave
a report for me, by chance,
 With the name Jack Ramsay
on it?
 He didn't mention anything,
 and I never heard him
say that name.
 No, I don't see anything.
 All right.
Evening.
 I don't believe
I thanked you properly
 for helping with
Ellen's wake.
 No need to, sir.
 I appreciate all you did,
 dressing her...
and making her up.
 It was beautiful,
even joyful,
 how everybody came together
to say goodbye.
 It reminded me of a wake
at the plantation.
 Never thought you could
compare an Irish wake
 with a Southern
slave wake.
 Oh, they are more similar
than you know.
 The singin' and dancin',
 a celebration of life,
pathway to heaven.
 You see, as a slave,
 a funeral tells you
that the dead,
 their lives had dignity
and meaning
 beyond unholy bondage.
 My wife was no slave,
but she was...
 ...oppressed by guilt.
 And I guess...
you can run away
 from that oppression,
the bondage,
 but there's always a chance
it'll catch up with you.
 Like my Ellen
and your boys.
 My boys?
 I know living in this city
must be hard for ya.
 Even now...
 ...stood next to an Irishman
you know yet little,
 an Irishman you've been
very kind to...
 but still a man
who is of the same race
 of the men
who lynched your boys.
 I thought for certain...
 drowning was a terrible way
to die.
 I lay awake at night
 praying that their last moments
were peaceful and painless.
 But beaten? Lynched?!
 Set afire?!
 Oh, momma--
 No, stay away from me,
child!
 I do not want
your touch!
 Please.
 I was just trying to shield you
from the hellish truth--
 My sons escaped the bondage
of the South,
 only to die here
at the hand of savages?!
 Keep it down,
will ya?
 You tell me,
 what the point of risking life
for freedom was?
 We should have told you, yes.
 But know that our dishonesty
came from a place of love.
 I trusted you.
 I invented the lie.
 For you.
 For me.
 Because I thought that
you would need it
 as much as I do.
 They were my babies!
 What kind of woman
has this vicious city
 turned you into?
 Where's the file
for the Bartlett case?
 Benjamin's suicide note?
 How many times
are we gonna have this dance?
 Look, I'm not playing the role
of the asshole captain now.
 Donovan is pissed.
Your job is on the line.
 I searched through storage
and it was there yesterday.
 Today, nothing.
 The governor's office
sent a man down here tonight
 to pick it up.
 They're taking over
the investigation privately.
 Meaning without you.
 That was fast.
 What?
 Watched the autopsy today.
 Jack Ramsay was murdered,
suffocated.
 So now you're chasing
two stale cases:
 Bartlett and Ramsay?
 Are you covering for him?
For Donovan?
 What in hell
are you talking about?
 One case.
I am only chasin' one.
 The Bartlett evidence.
 Hmm.
 Did you tell Captain Sullivan
who you were?
 Robert Marchant,
from Governor Fenton's office.
 Ah.
 Family murder-suicide.
Tragic, isn't it?
 I had a brother, Gregor.
 He was younger than me.
 And I realized I haven't thought
about him in a long time.
 But since I'm in here,
 I have these haunting memories
of him.
 When my brother Gregor
was nine years old,
 he didn't even flinch
in the face of death.
 He suffered coughing fits
and fevers.
 He didn't even waver.
 On his last night,
 Gregor told me
and my sisters goodbye,
 that he loved us,
 and then he was gone.
 There was no fear.
 No fear.
 I got no fear of dying.
 Hell, this life was sure
miserable enough.
 How much worse could
the next one be?
 Next?
 What if there is no next?
 I have spent months
staring at these dingy walls,
 lying in utter darkness.
 If there's nothing
but black for me
 after I hang...
 ...it ain't any different
than what I got now.
 What'll I care being dead,
anyway?
 I have yet to see
your bride tonight.
 I'd rather not discuss
the matter.
 As you are aware,
tomorrow morning,
 General Donovan
will be awarded the bid
 for the New Croton Aqueduct.
 He has presented us
with offers
 for each of the properties
we own in Five Points.
 Generous offers.
 Why would Donovan want more
Five Points real estate?
 He has plenty.
 Plenty is never enough.
 Besides, geographically
and pragmatically,
 the realty's in the way.
 Construction of the aqueduct
 will raze the majority
of the neighborhood,
 - at which point--
- One moment, father.
 Donovan's gonna level
his own ward?
 And we're gonna aid
this act;
 his displacing
the very constituents
 he claims to protect?
 You had no such protest
last autumn,
 purchasing the mother
A.M.E. Zion Church
 during our efforts
to demolish that cesspool
 to build a new Downtown.
 Robert,
you'd better soon decide
 where your values lie.
 Like a circus performer,
you walk a tightrope.
 On one platform:
a life of blind naivete,
 a life which you seem
to believe virtuous.
 On the other platform:
reality,
 our business,
your future.
 Let me guess, father.
 The longer I walk
the tightrope,
 the higher the likelihood
that I fall.
 Missus Morehouse.
 Lie down here.
 No, stay there.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Now, relax.
 Should the doubts
surrounding the Bartlett case
 be made public,
 such scandal
will disturb Tammany.
 I understand, sir, but--
 The organization's
primary focus
 is to benefit our city,
our people!
 We cannot jeopardize
all that's been gained
 over one random slut.
 When she's gone,
 the past will remain
in the past.
 Mister Donovan,
is there no other option?
 Send her away,
pay her off!
 Do you have a problem
with your orders, Detective?
 For I seem to recall
you sacrificed two women
 to cover your own misdeeds.
 Hmm? Forgive my lack
of compassion
 for your newfound
sensitivity,
 but I don't give a shite!
 And I possess a LeMat revolver
and two bullets,
 which I am confident
don't care either.
 You will kill
Teresa Trembley tonight.
 Am I understood?
 Move!
Hey!
 You should be good
for a while.
 I got your bread
and your sausages,
 and a bit of cheese there.
 Tell me, Francis.
Who was she?
 A childhood darling.
 Maeve was her name.
 I was only nine,
but first love and all.
 You got the same curious eyes.
 Always watchin',
wantin' to know more.
 Before I left Ireland,
 we made a pact
that we'd see each other again.
 I made a lot of promises
I never made good on.
 You'd like to see
Maeve again.
 Let me be your Maeve.
 The way you are...
 No man has ever treated me
this well.
 You deserve better than that,
Miss Trembley.
 You deserve the best.
 Francis...
 I'm not the best.
 Far from it.
 The last honest kiss I had
only led to sorrow.
 I'm leaving this city.
 I don't know where
I'm supposed to be
 or what my life
is supposed to be,
 but this...
this Five Points...
 It's yours,
it's not mine.
 If I were brilliant,
Momma,
 I would think of a way
to say that I'm sorry
 so that you could
forgive me.
 I know why you did
what you did.
 I will always love you,
Sara,
 and there's nothing that
can change that.
 I wish I hadn't have lied.
 Wantin' to carry heavy truths
for the sake of others
 is what we do when we feel...
brave and whole.
 Something I used to be...
 I need to become again.
 Where will you go?
 I don't know just yet.
 I held North in my heart so long
I gave y'all up to it,
 But this...
this ain't my North.
 Maybe I'll take Mister Tommy
up on his offer
 and go see J.D.'s orchards
 and those rolling hills.
 Canandaigua Lake.
 One of God's fingers.
 I hope you find
your freedom, momma.
 No! No! No! No! No!
 No! No! No! No!
 Please, please God!
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
 Please, please, let me live!
Let me live!
 Please!
Gimme another chance!
 Please, I don't wanna die!
I don't wanna die! Don't!
 Let me live!
No! Please! Please!
 Please just don't kill me!
No!
 No!
 Doctor...
 About my shop window...
 Ah, ah, ah...
 This makes you feel better,
does it?
 Waste of energy,
you ask me.
 This puzzle is not
comin' together!
 Maybe there ain't
no puzzle.
 Men in power
always want more.
 Same goes for men
with money.
 They'll do anything
to pump the well.
 It's just how it is,
how it's always been.
 Mankind doesn't change.
 So your ramblin' philosophy
of man
 means that
Donovan's crooked?
 Philosophy don't matter...
 But he is.
 And if you're willin',
 I need your help.
 I got myself
in a big pile of shit
 workin' for that man.
 I don't know what
Donovan wants,
 or what he's trying to do,
 but there's a big trail
of blood behind it.
 They had me shake down
Orrin Lansing.
 They?
 Donovan's got a guy,
a right hand man,
 I don't know his name.
 And what happened
with Lansing?
 A late night visit
that broke him.
 In return, Lansing killed
your man Milo O'Hearn.
 That's why
Lansing skipped town.
 No.
 Donovan believes
in mirrored punishment.
 Jesus Christ.
 And Corky...
 I've got your one
Teresa Trembley in hiding.
 But tonight, Donovan
ordered me to silence her.
 I can only imagine he's trying
to protect his own ass.
 You see, Teresa knows
who killed Alderman Bartlett.
 And right now,
 all the signs are pointing
up the ladder to Donovan.
 Goddamn it, Francis!
 Has Detective Maguire been
taking good care of you?
 He's been most kind.
 Ah, that's good,
that's good.
 Unfortunately,
Miss Trembley,
 our detectives have been
unable to locate anyone
 who matches the description
you gave
 of the Alderman's
wretched murderer.
 I'm at a loss, I...
 I told you everything I know.
 His height, his eye color,
his hair...
 That suit.
 And please understand,
I want to believe you.
 I... I'm sorry.
 And yet I feel
 you may have information
that may be useful.
 For instance,
 why would you regularly
open your legs
 for the Alderman
Stephen Bartlett,
 a fat man,
 far from handsome?
 Perhaps his... dagger
was more voluminous
 than average.
 Alderman Bartlett
and I--
 - Shh, shh, shh--
- No!
 Shh! It's all right.
It's all right,
 I know all.
 Don't be ashamed.
We all have secrets.
 Some are just dirtier
than others.
 For instance,
 I recently discovered
I am to father a child.
 Would you believe it?
 Congratulations, sir.
 Why, thank you.
 But your secrets,
Teresa darling,
 simply happen to be
more foul.
 To kill
Alderman Bartlett.
 No, I... I didn't kill
Mr. Bartlett.
 And his son!
 No! I never met
his son. I...
 Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Lass, shh. Shh...
 Do you know why I felt
I could tell you
 that I am to father
a child?
 A secret I've shared
with no other
 until this very night,
hmm?
 No.
 Because I knew you would
not speak of it.
 Because sadly,
 you'll not have
the chance.
 Teresa!
