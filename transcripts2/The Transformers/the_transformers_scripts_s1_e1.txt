 They were called Autobots and Decepticons. But the brutal Decepticons were driven by a single goal, total domination. They set out to destroy the peace-loving Autobots, and a war between the forces of good and evil raged across Cybertron, devastating all in its path; draining the planet's once-rich sources of energy. The Autobots, on the verge of extinction, battled valiantly to survive. -There's not enough energy in these conductors to last a quartex. -Well, at least we found these Wheeljack. -And when these run out? -Can't worry about that now. Hey, let's get back to Iacon. -Load up! -I bet Optimus Prime will be glad to see us. -We're nearing the bridge to Iacon.

 One mega-mile to go. -Ah, home sweet home. -Uh-oh. A Decepticon welcoming committee. -Autobots! Stop them! -Prime told me there'd be days like this. -And you didn't believe him? -I do now. -We gotta get these energy conductors back to Iacon! -I'm right behind ya! -Mind if I cut in? -After them! -Bumblebee! Get in, quick! -You all right? -Yeah. I... th-think it's my... rear axle. -Well, hang on to your crankshaft. I'm shiftin' into overdrive! -They've gone underground. We'll never catch 'em now. -We'd better report back to Megatron. -Wheeljack to Iacon, we're comin' in. -Laserbeak, prepare for flight. Destination: Iacon. Operation: assimilation. Laserbeak, Autobot alert. Disclosure averted. Continue observation. -Any luck, Jazz? -Negative. North side of Cybertron's blacker than the inside of a drive shaft. -Unless a new supply of energy is found, nobody is going to win this war. -When do we start the search mission? -Soon as you're ready to launch. -If there's a new source of energy to be found, the Decepticons must find it first. -Autobots are set to launch, Megatron. -As are we. Shockwave! -What is your command, Megatron? -You are to stay behind. I entrust Cybertron to you, Shockwave. -Fear not, Megatron. Cybertron shall remain as you leave it. -Excellent! Now it's merely a matter of time, until Optimus Prime admits defeat. -The Autobots would have lost eons ago, if I'd been calling the shots. -Starscream, only a select few ever lead. -My time will come, Megatron. -Never. Never! Prepare to blast off! All systems go! -Ignition. -Contact. -Blast off! -Look! -What is it? -An asteroid. -There's another one. -They're going to collide! -Leakin' lubricant. -Hang on, everybody! -Meteor shower! Meteor shower! -We-we're losing our power! -Jazz! -Ironhide, man the laser gun! -Got it! -Fire! -Follow them, follow them! -Viewtrex report. We are being followed. -Decepticons! -We have been detected. -Stay with them. -Let's just blow 'em away!  They've seen us! -No. I want to know what they're after. Prepare the tractor beam! JAZZ: They've made a magnetic junction! I can't shake them! -Fire the laser! -Nothin'. Power's used up. -Release the boarding chute! PROWL: They're coming aboard. -Prepare for battle! MEGATRON: Attack! Attack! -What's happening? PROWL: G-forces... They're dragging us down. -We're out of control! -Explore. Explore. -Repair. Repair. -Megatron, my leader. We are alive again! -Quickly! We must revive the other Deceptions. Much time has past. We are on a planet far from Cybertron, but our mission has not changed. -How do we know Cybertron still exists? -It must exist. And if this land is filled with resources, we shall return home with the power to build the ultimate weapon, and conquer the universe. Starscream! -I'm just saying goodbye! -Save your energy. The Autobots have taken their... [ laughing ] Last flight. -Thanks for the ride, Prime. Too bad you can't go the rest of the way. -Explore. Explore. Repair. Repair. -Thanks! -We'll set up here. Those rocks will serve as our base of operations. Soundwave, prepare plans for a new space cruiser. Starscream, convert the area for construction. -What about materials? -Use your imagination. -Well, any ideas? -There! -Great! I'll need some help. SOUNDWAVE: Rumble, activate pile drivers. Operation: destruction. -Let's do it! OPTIMUS PRIME: This new planet is rich with sources of energy. But the Decepticons must know this too, so we must find them and stop them. Hound! -Right here, Prime. -Scout the area. See if you can locate the Decepticons. -Just turn me loose, Prime. I'll sniff 'em out. -I'm goin' too. -I wanna boot some Decepticon right in his turbocharger. -Easy, Cliffjumper. Just find them... We'll deal with them later. OPTIMUS PRIME: Good luck! -Someday I'll be giving the orders, Rumble. You'll do what I say. -Look, Starscream... Megatron is strong, he's merciless. He can't be beaten, and you'll never be our leader. -I will find a way. Everyone has a weakness. -Yeah? Well, not Megatron. -We shall see. Now, shake things up a little! -I'm impressed! -Sure is a lot different than Cybertron out here. -Don't fall in love with it, Hound! We won't be staying that long. -You smell something, Cliffjumper? -No. -I do. I think we just found the Decepticons! Follow me! I was right. CLIFFJUMPER: Let's get down there and bend some metal. HOUND: Ease off your throttle, Cliffjumper. Remember what Prime said; just find 'em. -What are they doing? -Let's find out. MEGATRON: I will plunder Earth, and steal its precious resources. -We can concentrate the energy into energon cubes, and store them in the new space cruiser. [ evil laughter ] -How ironic! By leading us to this planet, the Autobots have sealed their own doom. -Cliffjumper, what are you doing? -I've got Megatron dead center in my viewfinder. SKYWARP: Who could be firing on us? THUNDERCRACKER: Who even knows we're here? STARSCREAM: The Autobots. -Impossible. STARSCREAM: They're the only ones! -Soundwave, send Laserbeak to investigate. Laserbeak, prepare for flight. Course heading: northeast. HOUND: Now you've done it. -Let's burn rubber. What is that thing up there? -I don't know, but we can't seem to shake it. -Let's split up! It can't follow both of us. -Right! At least one of us will get back to Prime. Accelerator down! Eat my dust, birdbrain! -You couldn't hit an Autobot with a moonbeam! Try this! It's a gas! -You don't give up, do ya? Aaaah! -Where'd they get ya? -I... I think it's my-my drive train. -Can you transform? -I... I don't think so. -I'm sorry, Hound. It's my fault. I shouldn't have fired on Megaton. [ laughs ] -You shouldn't have missed you mean. -Huh? [ laughing ] Yeah! Right! Hauler! Pull him up! -I can't believe the Aubotbots survived. -Heh. Neither can Megatron. I thought he'd blow a fuse when he found out. Hey, what's that? -Let's find out. -Okay, Reflector, let's see what you can see. Thundercracker to Soundwave. SOUNDWAVE: Proceed, Thundercracker. -Alien vehicle approaching. Possible Autobot. -Release Ravage. -I don't understand it, Joe. Looks like a tornado hit this place. -I... I don't like it. Something's wrong. Real wrong. -Look out! -Aaaah! -And that's all we heard, Prime. They're gonna put the energy in some kinda cube, then haul it back to Cybertron. -Jazz, organize a battle unit. We're going after them. -Prowl! Trailbreaker! Wheeljack! Ironhide, Mirage, Sunstreaker! Sideswipe! Autobots, start your engines! Ready, Prime. -Let's roll! -Megatron, Laserbeak has returned. He has found a source of energy. -Excellent. MEGATRON: Excellent! -Gimme a hand, Spike! We gotta raise this bit, flush it out! -Right, dad! I'll get the bailer! -Dive! Dive! -Look! Up there! -What is it? -What are they? -Everybody, come on! -Come on! -Stop! Let go of my dad! -Spike! -Starscream! Activate the null ray. Now! Soundwave, prepare the energon cubes. STARSCREAM: We did it! We did it, Megatron! The energy is ours! We can go back to Cybertron! -You fool, Starscream. This is but a small fraction of the energy we need. We must suck this planet Earth dry. -[ gasp ] It's the Autobots! -Deceptions, transform! Transform! Don't interfere, Prime! -Give it up, Megatron! -The universe is mine! So long, Prime. Have a nice swim! MEGATRON: Here's something to keep you warm! [ maniacal laughter ] -Help! HELP! We can't get out! -Somebody! Save us! -The fire! It's coming closer! -I can't lift it! Too heavy! Grab onto me. Keep your heads above water. NARRATOR: In the next episode of The Transformers... the evil Decepticons create a tremendous tidal wave. Optimus Prime battles his archenemy Megatron, high atop Sherman Dam, and Megtron discovers the ruby crystals of Burma. All in the next exciting episode of... The Transformers.
