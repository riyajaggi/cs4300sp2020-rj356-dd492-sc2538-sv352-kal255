 Honey, I'm home. I assume everybody read the chapter on dissection last night. Any questions? Uh... mine's moving. [sighs] They're all moving, Mr. Sinclair. That's your guarantee of freshness. I don't understand why we have to kill -a dumb, defenseless animal. - Robert, the miracle of life is as complex as it is beautiful. To fully understand it, we need to rip its guts out.

 All right, class, please uncover your specimens now. Uh...uh... Oh, boy. OK. Uh... Aw, jeez. All right. I'll come around and put each animal to sleep painlessly. Huh? [boy] Do mine! Do mine! You know what's happening, don't you? [grunting] - [thump] - [caveman groans] OK, think.

 Out the window. Yes! - [thump] - [cavewoman groans] OK, come on. Now's your chance. Get out of here! Oh! Oh! Go. Be free. Come on. [Robbie] Uh-oh. Forget the window. Get down. OK, OK, OK. Uh... [whistling] - Oh, hi. - Where is your specimen? Gee, I left the window open, and mine sort of got away. Whoops. [chuckling] I'll be staying after school? Oh, yeah. Mr. Sinclair, by allowing your science project to get away, you have denied yourself a valuable learning experience. It is these experiences which develop in us the primary trait which separates us from insects and cavemen. [all] The ability to reason. [Roy] Well, what do you think it is? I have no idea. It says "suggestions." Well, I could use a suggestion. What's it saying? Nothing yet. Hello? This is Roy. What do you suggest? [Richfield] I suggest that you are a complete idiot! OK, your turn. - [grumbles] - [groans] Do I have to explain everything? [both] Yes, sir. Apparently so. Look, the head office thinks we can benefit from listening to our employees. But we know better, right, sir? Yeah, we do. Nevertheless, should the day come when you actually have a thought in your head, put it in the box! I don't think I can get my head in that box. Write the idea on a piece of paper and put the paper in the box! Oh! Jeez. Easy for him to say. He's got the directions. Well, I suggest a simpler box. It's a trap, Fran. It says "suggestions," but it may as well say "trap." Aw, Earl, if you came up with a good suggestion, maybe you could get a promotion. Fran, my naive little cupcake, oblivious to ways of the workplace. Look, look! Look, look! - Uh... - Huh? Fran, if I put a suggestion in the box, it means I had an idea. If I had an idea, it means I had to think all day. If I'm thinking, I'm not working. If there's a suggestion in the box with my name on it, they've got proof. Trap! I can spot a trap in a second. Hey, Dad, every kid should have a pet, right? Sure. - [gasps] Get away! get away! - Shh! [Fran] Earl, if you want to get anywhere with the company, you have to show some initiative. I'm sure that's how Mr. Richfield got where he is. Mr. Richfield got where he is by eating his boss. Yoo-hoo, table monster. The dinosaur I married was full of ideas. He'd have no trouble filling up that suggestion box. What happened to the dinosaur I married? He's dead, Fran. You killed him. Let him rest in peace and eat his dinner. - Look! - Shh! [Robbie] uh-oh. Will you...? Huh? [Robbie] Um... Uh... [forced laugh] And now I must turn to you and say, "Huh?" Uh, he followed me home? Can we keep him? Please, please, please, please. This is not a pet. It's a wild animal. It's dirty, disgusting. It doesn't know how to live indoors. Oh, come on, Dad. See? We'll wash him, and we'll feed him and everything! You won't even know he's here. No! They breed like rabbits. If it wasn't for us being around they'd overrun Earth. I would worry about the baby being safe in the house with it. Baby toy, baby toy, baby toy! Oh, I like this. Oh, look. They're playing together. It's like he's already part of the family. I suggest you don't get too attached. See, Earl? That's a suggestion. - You make good suggestions. - Will you get off of that? I'll just bet if you put your mind to it you could come up with a great idea. I'll take that bet. Shouldn't we name him? What makes you sure it's a him? Maybe it's a her. [Robbie] Look at it. How can you tell? Let's call it Tramp. How about Sparky? Yeah. Yeah. [baby] Sparky! And if you came up with a good idea, Mr. Richfield might finally appreciate you. I don't want Mr. Richfield to appreciate me. I don't want Mr. Richfield to even know I'm there. I just want to avoid him for another 30 years and drop dead lifting something heavy. That is my dream. Earl Snead Sinclair! Here it comes. You can make a suggestion and have to face Mr. Richfield or not make a suggestion... [all] ...and have to face me. Your wives say that too? - Oh, yeah. - Me too. You don't have a wife. Uh, my mother called. [chuckling] Oh, Roy. So the wives are saying, "Make a suggestion.” - "Get a promotion." - "Put on a sweater." "Make something of yourself." - Are we gonna stand for that? - [all] No! Are we gonna be scared of our wives? [all] No! [all laughing] So long, guys. Back to work. They've gone. Got a pencil? - Over there by the box. - Thanks. I am not scared of my wife, but it's best not to antagonize her. You two! - Duh? - Huh? Are you writing a suggestion? Get in here! Suggestions! Want 'em, now! - Well, I... - Well, I... All right. Let me see which one of you I want to hear from first! Please, no, no, no. Not me, not me. Please not me, not me, not me. I think... ...I pick... ...you! [groans] Ah! Whoa! Oh, boy. I hate it. You better have something better than that. Well, I'm not sure that I can... Now! [groans] [clears throat] All right. [exhales] "I think Friday should be dress-up day." [chuckles] Perhaps it's in need of some fine tuning. I want a real suggestion now! [stammering] I.. ... I... th-th-think! Cut it out. In order to encourage greater productivity by the employees, some sort of incentive, like the guy who does the best work each month could be the employee of the month. His name could go on a nice plaque. Wait! I'm getting an idea. An award! We'll call it "Employee of the Month." - 1 like it. - Yeah. And the winner will come to my impressive estate and dine with me on a banquet fit for... well, for me. It's a trip to the moon on gossamer wings, sir. Yeah, and to save me the trouble of having to look around, I'm appointing you the first employee of the month. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Would you be embarrassed by a blubbering and effeminate display of emotions, sir? All right, now this dinner at my house... how about tomorrow? That's good for me, BP. It's not good for me! I'm having my bathroom re-grouted. So let's do it at your house. Problem? No, no, no! [chuckling] Mi casa es st casa. Ah. Two colleagues conferring over dinner, exchanging ideas like equals, bonding without touching. Are you still here? Oh, yes. Right, sir. I better get back out there and keep sort of a supervisory eye on all those non-employees of the month. Yeah, yeah, get out. Watch out for your, uh... Whoa! ...friend. Ugh! Sheesh. Did I actually faint in front of the big boss? Something miraculous has happened to me, something that will alter the very course of my life. Well, at least my bladder held. After 20 years of knocking down trees, I'm finally on my way up. So it's been a good day for both of us. Yeah. [male on TV] And here, we are lucky enough to witness the rarely seen human mating ritual. We sought to gently control the specimen with a tranquilizer gun. Hmm! Huh! Phil tags the ear and releases the slightly confused biped back into the wild for future study. [caveman groaning] It's almost as if they can think. They actually have large brains. It's right here in the Big Book of Cavemen. - See? - [Robbie] Huh. Yo-ho, yo-ho! The mighty megalosaurus returns to home and hearth with news. Ask me. Ask me. Yech! Not on the mouth. Now, Sparky, sit. [chuckles] At least somebody knows how to greet an up-and-coming executive. Earl, what happened? What happened? Gather round, dependents. I'll tell you what happened to Daddy that will dramatically alter our standard of living. - Upward? - Through the roof. Oh, Daddy, Daddy, let me get your slippers. Give me those! Come on. Hurry up. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It was a remarkable moment. Mr. Richfield and I were in conference, when I had an idea of such dazzling brilliance that I walked out of the meeting... [clears throat] ...employee of the month. [all gasp] Does this mean you'll get a raise? Salary and perks to be determined later, Charlene. [Charlene] Oh. Like tomorrow night when Mr. Richfield comes to our house for dinner! Whoa! He's coming here? Tomorrow night? [panting] Not now, boy. I have to come up with wonderful new ideas to impress the boss tomorrow night. You're not gonna turn into a land-raping executive type? Ooh, if they'll only give me the chance. Oh, and Frannie, I want your mother here for dinner. Are you sure, Earl? Am I sure I want your mother here? After all these years of telling me I'm a big nothing, to witness my ascension into the stratosphere of business? Oh, yes, I do think so. Tell her for dessert we're having humble pie, and she doesn't get any. [all laughing] Sparky, no! That pupu platter is for Mr. Richfield. Don't worry. We didn't forget you. Mmm. Doesn't this look good? [sniffs, groans] Ahh. [gasps] - [gobbling] - [doorbell rings] Oh! Oh, boy! Oh, that's him! Everybody, stay calm. Be polite. Don't panic. Don't panic. Get down, for God's sake. Get down! Get down! Be polite. Don't talk out of turn. If he bites something off of you, don't worry, it'll grow back. Daddy's job won't. [whimpering] [panting] Oh, calm down, calm down. That's it. We're equals. We're equals. Thank you for coming. This is the greatest moment of my life. Think nothing of it, fat boy. Which way's the food? There they are. There's my beautiful family. Hi, Mom. Hello, Fran darling. Robbie, Charlene, I have money. Who has kisses? [both] Grandma! JILalalalalalt - Oh, nice hat. - Hi, Grandma. [shrieking] There's a caveman in the house! No, no, no, no, no! Call the exterminator. Grandma, it's OK. This is Sparky, our pet. Yeah. This is man, Robbie. Man's not a pet. Man's one of nature's mistakes. - Ethyl... - Here comes the other one. Hardee-har-har, Ethyl. Ha, ha, ha. Get them in while you can because it all ends tonight. After 20 years of taking lip from you, it's payback time. That's right. Tonight my boss, mi amigo, is gonna come to my house to have dinner and suggestions from his esteemed colleague, me. He'll be walking through that door any second now. [crickets chirping] [ Sleigh Ride] Could I get the ear? J Michael, row the boat ashore J Hallelujah [groaning] I've lost all feeling in this arm. Honey, I don't think he's coming. He's probably stuck in a meteor shower. He's trying desperately to get here. Daddy, is it OK if we go to bed now? Yeah, go ahead. I'll wake you up when he gets here. Come here. [smooch] Ah, I better put the baby to bed. Oh! Hey, what's happening? Shh! Oh! Something's wrong. Ooh! Ooh! Baby's moving. Oh, it's the mama. I'm all secure. You'll always be husband of the month to me, Earl. Don't make me hate you, Fran. [sighs] Well, his loss, Dad. We were all rooting for you. Ahh! Get away. Get away! Hey, fat boy, this was the greatest night of my life. Ethyl, if I could move my arm, I'd crack your head like a coconut. Yeah, but you can't, and you're too stupid to realize you got another arm. [groans] [groans] [door shuts] [groans] Oh! [sighs] [grunting] Huh? - [erashing] - Oh! Oh! [cooing] Oh, you poor guy. Always waiting around for me to throw you a crumb of affection. And you'd wait all night, wouldn't you? Just like I did. You're a good boy, Sparky, and I appreciate your loyalty. I was loyal, too, for 20 years. I thought I was going places, but I guess I'm not. Well, I'm gonna give you a promotion. I'm gonna set you free. [chuckling] That's right. Robbie! [grunting] I still don't understand why we have to let him go, Dad. Robbie, it's not natural to keep one of God's creatures at the end of a leash, leading a life of desperation and zero hope. But Sparky seemed so happy with us. I'm not talking about Sparky. I'm talking about me. So wait a minute, we're keeping Sparky and letting you go? No, son. I'm more highly evolved than Sparky. I have a job, a home, a family. I'm trapped good. Hmm. Whoa. But it's not too late for Sparky to be put back where he belongs, with his own kind, where there are no masters saying "fetch" or "heel" or "make a suggestion." [grunting] Look, Dad, there's one of his kind. [both grunting] No, I think Sparky's found himself a little lady. Oh. Ohh. Huh! Hey, go get her, Sparky. [grunting] [sighs] Well, this is it, boy. You take care of yourself and stay away from science class, OK? Aw, bye. Yech! Not on the mouth! [sighs] Goodbye, buddy. You're free now. If anybody gives you any guff, you tell 'em, "I'm one of God's creatures, and I deserve respect.” Now go. Goon. [+ Born Free] Well, bye, Sparky. Hey, Dad, isn't that Mr. Richfield's trailer? Uh... yeah, yeah. Yeah, it is. Lucky thing for him he ain't there, the mood I'm in. Well, his light's on, Dad. - Huh? - Yeah. Well, lucky for him it's a school night. Let's go, Robbie. Come on. Dad, what better opportunity will you ever have to show your son what his father's made of? Ahh... [gulps] All right. Wait here. This won't be pretty. What a lousy life I'm having. I'm proud of you, Dad. Go get help. - Aw. - [door opens] Uh...excuse me, Mr. Richfield, sir, but I have something that needs to be said. - [Richfield] I'm busy! - [Earl] You should've called. [Richfield] Who are you to tell me what to do? I demand you treat me with respect. You've got a lot of nerve, Sinclair! [imitating Sinclair] I like nerve! I like you. I like the way you think, I like the way you dress. Has anybody ever told you you're a good-looking guy? [Earl] Well, thank you, sir. Uh... you're not so bad yourself. [as Richfield] Uh... So, um... you need a little money? [as Earl] Nah! Nah, I'm OK. [as Richfield] Well, you stop in anytime because you're the employee of the month. And no one can take that away from you. Yeah! All right! I hope I wasn't too rough with you there, B.P. I just had to get it off my chest. Well, let's go home, son. Dad, when someone pushes me around, I hope I have the guts to be just like you. So do I, son, so do l.
