 Dinosaurs (1991–1994): Season 2, Episode 5 - Endangered Species - full transcript 
 It's Fran and Earl's twentieth anniversary. To make it very special, Earl buys a delicacy for dinner: a species called grapdelites, who, thanks to his fellow snackers, are virtually extinct. While Earl desperately tries to keep everybody's prying paws off of his, Robbie fights to save their species.

 but Daddy bought it with money from his back-breaking job. - Let's see! Let's see! - Look! It's one of those mutant ninja caveman teenage thingies. I picked it out by myself for you. Just for you. It's from Dad. Ribbon! Mama got me ribbon! Ha-ha-ha! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mama got me ribbon! Ribbon! Mama got me ribbon! [TV] ♪ See what's waitin' for you J At the Food Chain } Da-da-ta-da. Ho, ho.

 Oh! Pop 'em in your mouth. They leave a trail down your throat. Yum, yum. Dollar-ninety-five a pound. Hey, on those hot summer days, nothing says refreshment like frozen rat on a stick. Mmm, boy. My grandkids love 'em. Whoa-ho! Beep-beep. - [honks horn] - Gourmet alert. Grapdelites are back. The sweetest-tasting, furriest little animals in the world. They used to be plentiful. Now they're in short supply. Get down here because when these grapdelites are gone, they're gone. Shouldn't you be on your way to the store? For what? Isn't your anniversary coming up? Yeah. So? - Your 20th anniversary. - Could be. That's the grapdelite anniversary, dude. I know that. What makes you think I don't? You gotta have more faith in your old man, Charlene. Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. Look at that. Hey, look at the time. I gotta go buy a set of tires. - Huh? - Robbie, grapdelites. See? Huh? For me and your mom's anniversary. - I got the last two. - Great. [Fran] Earl, is that you? - Hide these from your mom. - Huh? OK, I'm coming, Fran. Boy. - Shouldn't you be hiding us? - Can't you see he's thinking? I'm reminding him of his responsibility to his father. Hey, I'm trying to write a paper here, OK? - What's your paper about? - It's none of our business. It's a Social Studies paper and it's not going very well. "Why dinosaurs rule the Earth." "We're big." That really bites, doesn't it? There's no denying size allows almost unlimited benefits. Of course, the duality of nature dictates that for every benefit, there must be a cost. Don't you agree? - Uh, well, I, uh... - We've lost him. - Try an illustration. - Why is it good to to be big? We get to eat whoever we want. - Uh, no offense. - Oh, none taken. However, if you don't plan for the future, there won't be any more food. That would be the cost. What do you mean? There's always more food. - That's what "more" means. - Oh, dear. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Imagine that these are all the grapes in the world. Um, yeah. So? Now, suppose that you eat all the grapes. Mm. OK. - OK. Now what? - Suppose you want grapes tomorrow. Well, I'll go to the market and get some. But those were all the grapes in the world. - I'll eat something else. - Well, you rule the world. A world without grapes. So, you're saying if we eat them all, there won't be any more. - Think he understands. - An. Hah! I can stretch that to 500 words easy. - Or maybe he doesn't. - You guys can help me every day. Or at least until Mom and Dad's anniversary. - Hmm? - Oh. [groaning] So... Tuesday night, boys' night out. What's it going to be? - Hey, how about bowling? - Bowling. Yeah! Guess I'll keep the score again. Roy, you could try kicking the ball down the alley. [laughs] Oh, yeah. That's rich. It's tough being a tyrannosaurus. Anyway, I'm very good at soccer. Yeah. Hey, are you in, Earl? Hmm, Tuesday, Tuesday... No. That's Fran's anniversary. Mine, too, if you think about it. Oh. So then we'll see you at eight? Oh, no. This is the big one. The 20th anniversary grapdelite dinner. - [all] Oh! - You got grapdelites? Yeah. Two juicy ones. The last two they had. I remember the days when I was a kid, 99 cents they got for a dozen. I paid 8.99 each. - They can't find 'em around anymore. - Yeah. They're a rare delicacy now, but, boy, they are the sweetest-tasting things in the world. Yeah, I musta eaten a million of them. - Me, too. - Me, too. I wonder where they all went. Hmm. We'll never know. You might just have the last two in the world there, - you lucky guy. - Sinclair! - Uh... In here. Now! Uh... y-you wanted to see me, my captain? I hear you got your 20th anniversary coming up, Sinclair. How suspiciously cordial of you to take an interest, sir. The wife's probably looking forward to that grapdelite dinner. I'm sure she is, sir. Yeah. A little wine, candlelight, and those grapdelites are going to taste so sweet and satisfying. Mmm! You and the wife'll look each other in the eye and tell each other how much in love you still are. Who knows? Maybe you'll even take a little trip upstairs and... - [Earl giggles] - Ha! [both laugh] - It's not going to happen! - It's not? - I want those grapdelites! - What? They're my favorite food. Everybody's out of them. You got 'em, I want 'em. You don't give 'em to me, I'm gonna bite off your head. [stammers] But I can't give them to you, sir. They're for my wife. If she didn't get them she'd be very unhappy. How much is your wife's happiness worth to you, Sinclair? Uhh... Well, I see what you're getting at there, sir... Uh, Mr. Richfield, but no amount of money is worth taking this from my wife. My wife's happiness means the world to me. Here's 50 bucks. It's a small world, after all. But with all due respect, there is the matter of my own personal dignity, sir. You only get one 20th anniversary, and if I sell you my grapdelites, how much is my personal dignity worth? I got another 23 dollars for your personal dignity. That should cover it. [chortles] - Oh, and what about my self-respect? - I think we've taken care of that. Oh, good. [chortles] [sighs] Thanks for everything. I got an "F". - Oh, careful. - Hey. - Huh? Oh, sorry. I didn't see you. - You first. - Oh, he seems distressed. - I hope it's nothing we've done. "Why dinosaurs rule the Earth." I wrote an essay about what you said about how we're too wise to eat all the grapes. Look what the teacher wrote. "There will always be more grapes. That's what 'more' means." [both gasp] An "F". But just because the teacher doesn't understand doesn't mean you've failed. Stanley Kravitz got an "A". - What did he write? - He wrote "Because we're big." That was my answer. I had the right answer and I let you talk me out of it. - Why did I let you talk me out of it? - Because it's wrong. Yeah, but the teacher thinks it's right. What if the teacher's wrong? Yeah, right. What if the teacher's wrong? I try that on my parents all the time and it never works. The teacher said there would always be enough grapes, enough everything. Then she called me a radical! But there's not always going to be enough of everything. Leave me alone. I already flunked once and that's what I get for letting food do my homework. [both gasp] - Robbie! We're the last two grapes. - What? That's why they can't find any more of us. There aren't any. We're the last of our kind. - Uh, how can that be? - Because we're delicious. [both laugh] My parents will eat you tomorrow night. There won't be any more of you. Oh, boy. What a blow to your teacher. You guys should try to escape or something. No, we need to help you with your paper. It's very important. This is your last night on Earth. Forget the paper. The assignment is over. - Not if you don't know the answer yet. - No, no. Here, Robbie. Try it again. - OK. - Now, why do dinosaurs rule the Earth? - Mmm. - Why? [Earl] Robbie! - Uh-oh. - That's your father. - Happy anniversary. - Shh. Uh... [clears throat] Robbie, give me the grapdelites. Uh... [grapdelites] Shh! [Robbie] One minute the grapdelites were here, the next they were gone. I guess they must have run into the woods. - Why do you always do this to me? - I can't breathe, Dad. - Yeah, yeah. We all got problems. - Oh, please. [Robbie coughs] See... So they got away. If Mom could see how upset you are, she'd know how much you wanted her to have them and how much you love her. That's the only present she'll need. That's the only present she's gonna get. I sold the grapdelites to Mr. Richfield for 73 bucks. You sold Mom's anniversary gift? - He was gonna bite off my head. - Dad, where's your self-respect? I had to throw that in to close the deal. Aw, gee. Now they're running around unprotected. I've got to find those poor little sweet creatures before somebody else eats them for free. OK, OK, OK. Yeah. Your father seems to be under a lot of stress. - It's because of us, you know. - Yeah. - Perhaps we should turn ourselves in. - No! - One cannot avoid one's destiny. - One can try. Your whole species is at stake. Why am I the only one willing to fight for it? Perhaps that is your destiny. You seem to have a keen sense of moral responsibility. One who runs from responsibility can only become a slave to shallow and materialistic goals. - Ahal - Aha! Shh. Dad promised me a dollar if I found them. - Ha! - [sighs] 3 I get the dollar? Yeah. I'll give you two dollars if you keep your mouth shut, OK? I'm sure if you'd go 2, Dad would go 3. - Ahh... - Who are you? - We're the grapdelites. Who are you? - Oh, I'm the baby. Gotta love me! - Aw. Pleased to meet you. [laughs] - Let's play. Ooh! The innocence of children. - Ha-ha-ha! - Ooh! The unbridled spirit of youth. - Yeah. - Ooh! Give me that! Here's what it feels like. Hey! Hey! Ha-ha-ha! Again! - What? - Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Oh! Ha-ha! Again! Seven, eight, nine, ten. OK, here. - Easiest money I ever made. - Yeah, yeah, fine. Just get out. - Bye. - [Baby] Bye. Ugh! I don't know what came over me. I love children. - Do you have any? - What? Children. Hey, you could keep the species alive if you had children. I mean, you know, provided that one of you guys is a girl. Not that you don't have a really nice figure, whichever one of you... - ...might be a girl. - I'm the female. Why don't you have children? He's never even asked me out to dinner. There's no time for dinner. You are dinner. - Time is not the issue. - We don't believe this is a safe world - to bring up children. - Especially delicious children. Maybe we could make it safer for you and your children. Before me, nobody knew what you guys had to offer. I could tell other dinosaurs. - His optimism is encouraging. - Mm. But is it justified? Who should I tell first? Ooh, how about your father? Uh... No. What are our chances if you can't convince your own father? - Yeah. - Yeah. Here, little grapdelites. Come on, you little furry fellas. My boss wants to meet you. [chuckles] Dad, I've got something for you. [gasps] Robbie, you found them! Way to save your dad's life! Dad, your grapdelites are the last two in the world. - You can't give them to Mr. Richfield. - But, Robbie, he paid for them. - They belong to him. Really. - But they're not just food. They know stuff. The world will be worse off when they're gone. Why? They showed me that there are other creatures in the world that are, maybe not as important as dinosaurs, but it's important that they be here. And you believe that? They trust us to do the right thing, Dad. [groans] You try to make a couple extra bucks for your family and what do you get? A burning moral dilemma from your son. How dare he put this on me? Well... Perhaps it's just that he believes in you. How do you know? Well, you know how he feels about us, and still he gave us to you willingly. - Willingly. - Yes. If that doesn't show faith, I don't know what does. - Food for thought. - Thought from food. Are you guys really going extinct? [yawning] Any minute now. Yes. Oh, yeah. I have a big decision to make here, huh? - Mm-hm. - Uh-huh. I hate those. Sinclair! Entrer with the entree. OK, you guys. Get back in the box. Come on, watch your heads. [snarling] Hurry up, Sinclair! I'm salivating all over my desk! ...I'm sorry, Mr. Richfield. [stammers] I've decided that these grapdelites are not for sale. - What? - Here's your money back. Sinclair, you dog. You got the nerve to put the squeeze on me? I like it! I respect it! Name your new price. There is no price. You stink at this, Sinclair! These are the last two grapdelites on Earth. If you eat 'em, there aren't any more. Forever. So, I'm sorry if you're angry, but I've made my decision. Angry? Well, I'm not angry, Sinclair. I'm appalled. I had no idea. Then... you understand? Oh! I am deeply touched by the sad plight of these poor, poor creatures. I want to help 'em! Well, that's not necessary, sir. I'll just take them home So my son can protect them. Well, Your son may be well-intentioned, but he, like you, is a simple individual, and you simple individuals do not have the vast resources to accomplish good in the world. Well, who does? Corporations, such as this one. Good can only happen in this world when individuals put their trust in corporations. We'll take care of your little friends. Gosh, Mr. Richfield, corporations really do that? - Corporations do. - So, what do I do? Hand them to me. Ahh... You've done the right thing. Um, buy yourself something nice. Thank you, sir. [cackles] Gee, who'd have ever thought a corporation could be compassionate and caring? - [erunching] - [gasps] [gasps] [cackles] "Why dinosaurs rule the Earth." Hmm. - [eracking] - Huh? - [gurgling] - What? Am I goin' crazy? Huh? Wha... Oh, my... Wow! - [babies gurgle] - Oh! Robbie... Dad, come here. Check this out. - Ooh! - [Robbie laughs] Huh? Ooh. Daddy? I promise. - Happy anniversary, Fran. - Happy anniversary, Earl. Oh! Aw... Coochie-coo. Babies. Babies. [babies munch]
