 I love being up with the mama. Ah, is that why you wake me up at 3:00 in the morning, just to be with me? Yeah, well, that and I'm hungry! Feed my mouth! Fill my belly! Ohh, ohh, ohh. [creatures shrieking] - [Fran] Back. Back! - [creature] Mine! Mine! It's 3:00 in the morning. OK. - OK. - Hurry, Mommy. Hurry. - Give it. Give it, Mommy! - Here you go, sweetheart. Right there. [sucking] Delish! Uh-oh. Uh-oh! Oh. Stomach growling. Pressure. I'm gonna blow up! I'm gonna blow up! Oh, I'm gonna blow! Oh, I'm gonna blow! Clear! [quiet belch] Ahh. Good job. [giggles] - [loud belch] - [rattling] Well! Now you really must, must go to sleep. Whoa, hey! We're gonna walk. We're gonna do the tour. Wow! I love the tour. I'm gaga for the tour. Walk, walk, walk. Hey, wait a minute! You're trying to put me to... - [snoring] - I don't believe you. I don't blame you. I'm gonna do this all night. [laughs] [animal shrieking] J Bop bop bop ba da dee doop J Bop bop ba da do dow J Oh, yeah [snoring] Hey, Mom, did you make breakfast? You're always saying that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. I understand that from a nutrition point of view. You always say I'm still growing and that if I don't have breakfast, I'll just end up looking like a little stunted anthropod. I appreciate that and everything, I really do. Uh... except today. I don't have time for breakfast. I've got early practice for the game against Mesopotamia. Cereal? Come on. Cereal? I want something hot. I want two waffles with an animal in the middle. Can you whip that up? Huh? Don't give me any trouble. [creatures grumbling] [horn honks] [Charlene] There's my ride. Oh! Bruno's in the car! Oh! How do I look? How do I look, huh? Charlene? Mom, get some sleep. Bye. [tires screeching] [sighs] [creature] Gimme. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme! [gobbling] Waffles! [birds calling] [caveman language] Frannie, I know your days are awful full, what, with your bonbon lunches and girl chat at the produce counter, but maybe you could put a button on this shirt I've been asking you to put on since last night. [gasps] [groans] I've been up since 3:30 this morning, and the baby wouldn't stop crying. You had a tough night with junior? Robbie came in and said, "I want." And Charlene came in and said, "I want." All right, I'll just run over an antelope on my way to work, have some for breakfast, put the rest in the lunchbox, I'm covered. Stop talking! You're talking too loud. Wake that baby, I'll bite your head off. Well, nobody wants that. All'l do is cook and clean and clean and cook, that's all I ever do. I'm turning into a drudge. Earl, am I a drudge? Uh...uh... I love you? Oh. Cook and clean, clean and cook. That's all I ever do. These are the tools of my trade. How's my favorite married couple? Fran, put the knife down. OK, see you at work. Right behind you. Oh! Whoa! I don't get what the big deal is. We all have our parts to play. I'm the breadwinner, and she's the drudge. Where's the problem? Well, we are in uncharted territory now, pally boy. This new thing with dinosaurs getting married has thrown the conventional wisdom out the window. All right. Let's try to get a handle on this. I've got a wife's who's unhappy about something. This is without historical precedent. OK. Let's think. Yeah. We should be able to figure this out. Yeah, we got brains the size of walnuts. All right. What about this? Fran's, like, broken, right? I got a broken wife. So, what do you do if your car is broken? Uh... you kick it and leave it by the road. Yeah, but what if you're used to your car, and you've put on a few pounds since you met your car, and you're not sure if you can attract another car? Are we really talking about cars, here, pally boy? I don't know what the problem is. She's been upset ever since the baby was born. She wasn't upset before the baby. Before the baby, not upset. After the baby, upset. Baby, upset. No baby, no upset. You lost me completely. It's the baby! It's the baby and the house and the kids. It's too much for her. She needs some time off. But if she takes some time off, then who looks after the kids? I am so hungry. - You could do it. - Huh? You could take the kids for a weekend. Why would I want to do that? Well, because it's just one weekend. And when she gets back, she'll be relaxed and refreshed and ready to go again like a brand-new drudge. Yeah. I guess I could look after my kids for a couple of days, seeing as how it's in my own self-interest. Well, we did it. We had a problem, gave it some thought, and we solved it. - And I feel pretty good. - Me too. What day is this? - I have no idea. - Oh. Not the mama! Not the mama! Not the mama! Not the mama! Not the mama! Not the mama! Not the mama! You do that one more time, and I'm going to throw you across the room! - Not the mama! - Ahh! Wee! Oof! Again! What's for dinner? I don't like your attitude. [gasps] It doesn't look done to me. It's done. It's damn done. Hey! You give me that back, or I'll kill you. Here you go, ace. Next time you might want to turn the oven on. Uh, just a thought. So, what do you think really happened to Mom? Nervous breakdown, carried off by predators? Dad said she's at Grandma's. Isn't that what they always tell the children. Hey, Dad, when's Mom coming back from Grandma's? When she's recuperated from you. Until then, I'm the mother. OK, Mom, can I go to a movie tonight? Not a chance! Dad said I could. Uh... he really did? Mm-hmm. Dad, I had a late lunch. See you later. Where are you going? Out with the guys to mark some territory. Take a sweater. Wait! If he gets to go out, I do too. Ahh! Oh! Oh! I slaved over a hot oven making a nice dinner for you kids, and now you'll sit at this table and eat that dinner and express proper gratitude to your mother/father! [groaning] He's stuck there. And yet we can move freely. - 'Night! - 'Night! You don't think I'll let go of this table to come after you two? I'm telling you, you're playing with fire! No. I'm playing with fire. What? [laughs] Ooh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! [laughing] - Daddy! - What? - Hot. - Oh! Where are we going? [Baby laughing] Again! Not again! Not ever again! No more of this for me. Tomorrow I go back to work, and I'm only grateful that I am not the one who has to do this for the rest of my life. The mama. Hi, honey. How was your day? No, no, no, Fran. Don't explode. Everything's all right. Take another day away. I don't want another day away. I missed it here. But you were unhappy here. - But I was unhappy away. - Now, Fran, make sense. There's only here and away. The kids made you unhappy, I gave you a whole weekend off from the kids. - Now you're fixed. - It's not the kids. Earl, there's something wrong in my life, and I don't know what it is. Your life? What life? Your life is me and the kids. All right, look. Here's your life. This is the kids. OK? And this is... this is me. OK, now, if it's not the kids... ...what is it? [telephone rings] Hello. Roy? It's me. [sighs] You should have seen her, Roy, just standing there looking at me. It made me feel so bad, it was all I could do to leave the house and come down to the bar. - What does she want from you? - She doesn't know. As I understand it, she does not know. So then why do you have to do anything? Because I'm the problem. Look, Earl, I've known you 27 years. That's longer than Fran's known you. And in all that time, I never thought of you as a problem once. Yeah, but you're my pal. Well, what about the rest of you guys? You know Earl. Has anybody here got a problem with him? - He's a good guy. - We love you, big guy. Look, you're a room full of guys, and the problem's with the wife. And the wife is female, so maybe what you've got is a male/female problem. What kind of male/female problem? We're married a long time, and we just had a new kid. Anyway, just this morning I said, "I love you." - Did you say it sincerely? - Nah. It was a defense mechanism. When was the last time you did the mating dance? - What are you talking about? - The mating dance. The ultimate expression of a male's absolute commitment to a female. [screams] I myself do it three, four times a week. The mating dance is a courtship ritual. You do it to woo and win. I wooed. I'won. I'm done. Maybe it's time to re-woo. I don't have to. I got her. She's in the house. Maybe the mating dance isn't just to get her. Maybe it's to keep her. Forget it. You don't do the mating dance for a 38-year-old mother. - Why not? - Because. Because what? Because... uh... I forget how. [male on TV] And finally, in local news, officials at the city zoo report no luck in trying to mate Ling-Ling and Chang-Chang, the two rare imported humans. Zookeepers are baffled at why two seemingly healthy cavepeople have not yet produced offspring. At this point, it's feared that Ling-Ling is barren. And now for the weather. I'm going to bed. Oh, OK. I'm not cleaning anything up. I'm just going to bed. - OK. - Don't expect anything from me. I wouldn't. And if you lose a button, whose problem is that? Mine, all mine. Good night, dear. [Fran] Don't patronize me. [male 2 on TV] Hey, guys, wanna make more of an impression with the ladies? From time immemorial, dinosaurs have known there's only one way to a woman's heart. It's not flowers. It's not candy. Yes, it's the mating dance. Whether you're a beginner wanting to learn first steps for after the prom or an old married guy with a wife who's overwhelmed by one kid too many, Mel Luster's Mating Dance Academy has the steps for you. We're open all night because, let's face it, when else you gonna come here? Mel Luster, since 72 million B.C., always the same location, in the heart of the seedy part of town.

Well, I, uh... uh... OK. Not at all. Well, we're open all night. - [Mel] Bend, will you bend? - [Earl] Come on, I've got such a cramp. I'm not as young as I used to be. - [Mel] How old are you? - [Earl] Uh... 28. Yeah. Right. Left, right. And left. [both] Weave. Turn, kick. Bob, bob, dip. Weave. Weave, turn... kick. Neck. Neck.

Frannie? Mmm. Earl? Where have you been? I've been out taking care of your problem. You'll be happy to know that you don't have a problem anymore. I'm so happy. Good night. No, no, no! Look! You're gonna want to see this. It's important. I learned it all over again, just for you. Ahh! Mm-mm. Ahh. Ahh. Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh! Mmm. Doo, doo, doo. Da! Fran? [crickets chirping] Your problem is just that you're tired all the time. [Baby] I'm up again! Oh, I'll get it. No, no, sweetheart. You sleep. You need your sleep. What? [Baby] Not the mama! Not the mama! Not the mama! Not the mama! I really wish you'd grow out of this. Hey, weekend guy, you think you got what it takes to put me to sleep? Please. I've outlasted actual mamas. Hey, what are you doing? [humming] Hey, this is nice. I like it. Hey, you like that, then you'll really like this. - What? Whoa! - [both laughing] Ooh, this is fun. What are you doing, Daddy?

He fell asleep. 1 did it. You put the baby to sleep with the mating dance. No, no, no. That was just a baby dance. I loved it. But why didn't you like the one I did for you upstairs? I liked that one 20 years ago. Now I like this dance, where you got out of bed in the middle of the night and helped me. That's the best mating dance I've ever seen. Come on. What are we doing? What would you like to do? If it's all the same to you, Fran, I'd like to catch about 40 winks. You got it, big boy.
