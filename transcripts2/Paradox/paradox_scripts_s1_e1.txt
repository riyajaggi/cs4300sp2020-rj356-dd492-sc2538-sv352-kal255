 Paradox (2009â€“2010): Season 1, Episode 1 - Episode #1.1 - full transcript 
 Astro-physicist Christian King receives images from outer space showing fragments of an explosion which will occur in eighteen hours and result in several deaths. He approaches police inspector Rebecca Flint, who is initially unconvinced until she sees that a phone number among the images is genuine. With her team of Gada and Holt, and helped by King, she pin-points the catastrophe as happening on a railway bridge, where a train has broken down and towards which a lorry containing explosive materials is heading. Ultimately, as Rebecca seeks solace with Gada, King sees more images projected onto his screens of likely future events.

 You have to believe me, I've been told to protect you. The man in the photograph, he's dangerous. You're starting to freak me out. There's not enough to charge him. A wormhole is a distortion in space-time. - You're saying you've found a wormhole? - I may have found a way of detecting one. What about next time? For the victims, it's too late. I've got a role to play here... I'm beginning to understand that. It's not just him, it's them. There are two incidents at the same time.

 The only thing that's holding him is the carabiner. This is DI Flint... - Help! - ...there's only one platform. You've got to call it. Yo. C'mon man, get in the car. Hughes is up. They're back. Oi! What's going on? You weren't answering your phones. - What's happened? - I made it clear yesterday. This project and the MoD's position in it will not be compromised again - on the whim of an individual. - You broke in to my home. Perhaps you'd like to dress in the bathroom. Piss off.

 I'll handle it, Ben. Please. This is my life. My private life. If I decide to turn my phones off, they stay off. You have no private life, Rebecca. You're not out there, making the decisions. This isn't a part-time assignment. I can't draft in replacements. - I need you functioning. - Or what? More transmissions have been received. Christian isn't in the Control Room. He turned off all his communication devices and drove to the moors. It was thought he would respond more favorably to you. Christian... what are you doing? They're tracking your mobile. They broke in to my home. God! You know, I don't want to be here. All you... reduce this to you, how you feel. 3D solutions for civil servants. Beyond this sky are planets, galaxies, possibly other universes. 10, 11 dimensions. We humans are not even specks. Then why are you angry? Why do you care how self-centered we are? Last night you saw a man fall to his death. Now you know what failure feels like. Well, maybe you're more human than you think. Where can we run to, Christian? Tell me, I'll run with you. Is that a rose? An ultrasound scan. One, two, four, five. This has to be a mistake. We've had this before. Logo for Outcome Initiatives, led us to the rapist, Stuart Taylor. Stand back from the cordon, please. Police car coming through. Oh, God, no. How many bodies is that? Three? Four? If the images came down at 20:23, that means we've only got... 4 hours and 23 minutes. - Is that all of them? - There's one more image. Christian... It's my watch. It's identical to my watch. Dad. What are you doing? Cooking breakfast. I'm not eating mushrooms. You're not getting any mushrooms. See if your mum wants some. She's asleep. It's Saturday. So you'll get to see me twice in one weekend, then, eh? That's Zac Hedley. I want you to stay away from him. Understand? I wanted you to stop shagging DI Flint, but you didn't, did you? We're in this together, Jase. If you want money, just ask me. Keep away from my daughter, Hedley. Before you can accuse me of something, you need evidence, DS Holt. I helped put your father away. Nick the full set, I'll earn extra points. What happened? A body was discovered this morning. - Sonia? - The owner of the shop? Yeah. Dear Lord! How? There was a struggle. They believe she'd been raped, then stabbed through the neck. They've got a suspect. Do you know the suspect's name? Gus Channing. Boyfriend, apparently. Channing? Are you sure? Blood stains on his clothes. Fled the scene. Claimed he panicked when he discovered her. Case closed, if you ask me. Same watch. It looks like my hand. It does... look like my hand. Coincidence? Callum? - It looks similar to your hand. - Just because you, hypothetically you, are holding the gun, doesn't mean you fired it. MAC-10 machine gun. 1,000-plus rounds per minute? 30 rounds per magazine. What would you be doing with that? Zoom in. - Zac Hedley. - Zac Hedley? Hedley's trouble. Dad's in Pentonville, armed robbery. Nasty, vicious shit. His wee brother Jason's excluded from school. Got an address? 12 Blackthorpe, Collyhurst. Leah... knows Zac Hedley. Your daughter? Just an acquaintance... allegedly. This came down last night. I spoke to Hedley this morning. That's odd. I'm not being paranoid. That is odd. Why? Why did you talk to him? To warn him off my daughter. Is there a... is there a possibility that Leah might see Hedley today? Anything's possible. Does that... does that look like Leah to you? Was she wearing a green top? Um... she had on her night clothes. There's a chair, functional. School? Meeting hall? - Which college does Zac Hedley attend? - I don't know. - Leah, it's Dad... - No, don't spook her. Ring me, OK? It's urgent. Bullet hole in glass. Well, it doesn't have to be a school. Kids congregate in... in sports halls, clubs, shopping centers. It's not a bullet hole. These kids have been shot, there's an image of a gun. Maybe if you'd been doing your job instead of taking a constitutional. Ben. Don't defend... don't you dare defend him! - Have you got kids? - Look, I understand you feel guilty about leaving the marital home, but that's no reason for me to confuse sentimentality with true feeling. What? If you intend to hit me, can we just circumnavigate further provocation and cut to the act? What is the matter with you both? We need to stick together, not tear ourselves apart. Maybe I got out of the wrong side of bed, maybe it's images of dead kids, one of which could be my daughter. Can we just get on? It's a bloody bullet hole. I'll find Hedley. If it's not a bullet hole, then what is it? Spontaneous explosion. It's caused by an internal fault in tempered glass, as indicated by the figure of eight. Is that a heart? Well, it can't be just a heart. - There has to be something about it. - Diseased? Christian? I'm a physicist. Hiya. Hiya. This is kind of a coincidence. Dad saw a photo from the concert, got it totally wrong. - If he sees you... - He has. Was he embarrassing? He's a cop and my dad. Of course it was embarrassing. - Sorry. - It's OK. I know all about embarrassing parents. Sorry. Leah, it's Dad. If you see Zac Hedley, ring me. Then stay away from him. D'you understand? Stay away. I love you. I'm going to go for something to eat. D'you want to come? Yeah, yeah, I missed breakfast. That'd be great. Sh... Shame of si... Patrick was stabbed to death in Felix Park. - We all know the Depwell Gang did it. - Shit. If you witnessed Patrick's death, tell the police. They're all over the streets Everywhere. - But they're not fingering anyone for it. - Kids saw, if they talk... It's Hughes, got to be Hughes. We need to show people we're not scared. Do something bigger than nicking his motor. Make an example. What d'you reckon, Jase? Yeah. You in? Me? Course. It's just the post. I'm frightened to be in my own home. All the plans we had when we bought this place. Kids playing in the garden. Happy. That's what we said when we came through the door, a happy house. Stuart Taylor. I know. It's weird. Identical image, previous time code. Why would the same image come down for two separate events? Taylor is somehow involved in the shooting? Taylor's a violent rapist. His attacks are sexually motivated on lone women. Why would he be involved in killing teenagers? We didn't get Taylor the last time. We're being told - we've got unfinished business. - That's a moral judgment, not an indicator of something in the future. Maybe, but if justice had been done, he wouldn't still be out there. Where are you going? - After him. - I am still your senior officer. You go when I say. - Thank you, Mr Hughes. - Thanks. Crime number. Forensics and CID'll be round later. Well, maybe this time they'll get them. Leah? Charlie? Cathy, ring me. I'm trying to find our daughter. Sciencestairway.com is a dead end. Why send a domain name that doesn't work? What, the meaning's in the name? Science stairway? What does that represent? It's a description of a point in space-time, where C is the speed of light and X, Y, Z are spatial co-ordinates. We're being sent some sort of directions. If an extraterrestrial was sending you a message, it's the equivalent of 2 + 2 = 4! 2+2 = 4? You mean it's basic physics vocabulary? School standard? - Yes. - Why didn't you say so? - I did. - No, no, you didn't. OK, just you and me. Let's be completely honest. We know from experience, not only the images, but the decisions we make, the people we meet, they all lead us to the final incident... however much we may wish it was otherwise. Ben seeing Zac, Leah... an identical watch to mine, a gun, victims... the likelihood of these being coincidences... Is highly improbable. Somehow, I may be responsible for the death of those teenagers. - If that's the scenario. - Ben's daughter? Even by accident, how could that happen? - If I take my watch off... - The watch is an accessory not the event. Remove the watch, that's all you change. It won't prevent you picking up the gun. This time's different, isn't it? How d'you mean? It's about us. Stuart Taylor, we were all involved in that. An equation for space-time, science stairway, Leah, my hand - I mean, it's all so intimate. We mock Callum, but could someone be sending us messages? I don't know, making this happen? We have a certainty - without intervention, those teenagers will die. We have a strong probability... you kill them. What do I do? Kill myself first? - No. - Well, I have to get out of this. Whilst pursuing the certainty, we eliminate the possibility. At 2:23 you are nowhere near the victims, you are nowhere near a gun. It's never as simple as that, Christian. We will not allow this to happen, Rebecca. Trust me. Please. I used to get so excited, and now... now I just feel sick. What time did Stuart Taylor return to the hostel last night? And did you notice anything odd about him? Anything - his clothes, his behavior? You think he was wearing a different jacket. If he comes back, call me. I checked to see if Stuart Taylor and Hedley's father served time in the same prison. Drew a blank. Zac Hedley attends Bevan College. Ring them. I did a blink test with multi-exposures from Hubble. How the hell did you get hold of that? Why? Do you intend informing the MoD? No. At the same time, I compared the footage with a moment we assume a wormhole must have opened. I then matched that with my own replica star field experiment. As with a black hole, we assume there's no light reflecting from the wormhole to actually observe the opening. But see the distortion of these stars, as though they are bending round something. It's very possible that in the center of those distortions is the wormhole. Have NASA or the ESA picked it up? They think it's a software problem. My God. It exists. It actually exists. The wormhole found us, Simon. We still don't know how or why these images are being sent. I need a list of physicists specializing in wormholes, quantum tunneling... especially those working for the MoD. You think that if there is a wormhole, it's being manipulated? The rose is called a "Peace" rose. "Peace" rose. Try "peace" plus "Bevan College". The college has a "Peace On Our Streets" campaign. Committee made up of students and a member of staff. Hang on, Ben. Putting you on loudspeaker. Is the member of staff a physics teacher? Matt Hughes, yeah, physics teacher. Bevan's the same college dead boy Patrick Broadbent, stabbed this week, attended. Same college Zac Hedley attends. - Any sign of Hedley? - No. Did you find Leah? No. I went to Hedley's house. If Mum's around, she's not providing any parental support. Press cuttings of armed robber Dad in the boys' bedroom. Obviously a role model. Matt Hughes has made complaints about threats from a gang of youths. - This morning he reported his car stolen. - I'll get his address... Talk to him. I really think I should check Stuart Taylor out. I'll take Bevan College and Patrick Broadbent. It's 12:11. Nothing's going to happen yet. You deal with Taylor. No, it's ridiculous. Cancel. You've got an excuse. You're waiting for the police. - What kind of message would that send? - You've done enough. I just want us to be safe. Let them kill each other. - We'll move away, somewhere new. - Julie... What if I made you choose? - Me or your students? - I love you. How many times do I...? You're not in competition with them. You wouldn't go if we had our own children. You honestly think it's OK to say things like that? Has your dad... killed anyone? Depends on whether he's drunk or sober when you ask. Do you go and visit him in prison? Jase, my brother does. Hero-worships him. Jase is officially thick. Sometimes I wish they were both dead. I'd just be me. Mrs. Hughes? DS Holt. Is your husband in? Have you come about the car? Yes, yeah, I have. You promised you'd do something. You said you'd stop them. Sorry, I'm new to the case. Stop what? The graffiti? The turds through our letter box. The scum stealing our car. The threats. - Threats? - To shoot our dog. What the hell are you doing here if you haven't read our file? Getting angry with me isn't going to help, Mrs. Hughes. Why are you being targeted? Matt's a teacher, Bevan College. The students were carrying knives. It's like some epidemic - one carries, they all do. So Matt formed the college peace movement. He encouraged students to report on violence, harassment, drug dealing. To give him his due, he's been pretty successful. It upset people. Who? The Depwell Gang. The same gang that knifed Patrick Broadbent. - The boy in the park? - According to students at the college. That's why Matt's holding a meeting. - What meeting? - Peace Committee. This afternoon. 2:15 at Bevan. - Where is he now? - I don't know. We... He left early. I'm going to need his mobile number and the registration of your stolen car. BV54 JUY. Hughes has got to arrive first. He has to open up. No. You hang on to it, it's your dad's. Someone's coming. Mrs. Evans. My name is DI Flint. I'm making inquiries about events at Bevan College this afternoon. Could you call me, please, on 077... - Cops. - What are we going to do? Don't look at 'em. No-one look at 'em. It's stopping. Stolen vehicle is a silver Rover, registration. Bravo Victor 54 Juliet Uniform Yankee, heading south down Gatewood Street away from Bevan College. Silver Rover. Registration Bravo Victor 54 Juliet Uniform Yankee, heading south down Gatewood Street away from Bevan College... Mrs. Broadbent? - DI Flint. - Have you got them? If I could just ask you a few questions about Patrick? 15. Walking through a park in daylight on his way home. I heard people think a gang did it. The Depwell Gang. Was Patrick in a dispute with them? You don't dispute with them. They choose you. They pick on your kids. They hold old people hostage in their homes. Is Zac Hedley part of this gang? There's a Hedley, yeah. If there are witnesses, then... You're probably looking at them. It's not going away. It don't stop because you keep your mouths shut. They're kids. They're just evil kids. No wonder they think they're untouchable. My baby boy... bleeding to death with a knife through his heart, and... silence? Patrick Broadbent's mum left a single yellow rose at his memorial. Plus if looks like Zac Hedley's a member of the Depwell Gang. Hedley's in the Depwell Gang? Allegedly responsible for the murder of... Patrick Broadbent. I know. They threatened to shoot Matt Hughes's dog. You know we never found his dad's gun. What's the betting Zac Hedley's got access to a firearm? - Bravo Victor 54 Juliet... - What's going on? - ...east onto Heath Lane. - Stay out of this, Rebecca. I'm taking care of Hedley. No-one's going to die. Yeah. Any sign of Taylor? - Not yet. - Any idea how he fits in to this? Callum? Callum? Please, God, give me the strength. He's gaining. - Shut it. - If they get the gun, Dad'll kill me. You have to finish Hughes. Shoot him? Me? If he gets someone to talk, then that's it. If they hear Hughes is shot, they'd shit themselves rather than say anything. I can't. We've got to dump the car. - I thought you was hard like your dad. - I am. Do you want to be part of this family? - Yeah. - Then do it, you baby. - Do it. - Kill Hughes. Make your dad proud, Jase. What would you say you like most about being a scientist? There are no answers, only more questions. Thank you, Dr... Dad doesn't care about Mum or me or Charlie. He'd rather be at work with that bitch. Last few weeks, he's just been angry all the time. Course he cares. That's why he warned me off. He just wants the best for you. My parents think love's giving you a tenner. You ask Dad what I want to be, he hasn't got a clue. What do you want to be? Physicist. Vehicle heading south into Dogwell Way, Frenton Industrial Estate. All units in pursuit. You're murdering no-one, you little shit. Get out of the way, you nutter! He's trying to kill us! No, stay where you are. Stop! Where's Hedley? Where's Zac Hedley? Step away from the car. DS Holt. They're armed. Hands behind your back. Call sign 83, we need back-up, please. The firearms guys have taken the car apart It's clean. It can't be. The little shits have got a gun. I know it. Lend me your mobile. I need to make an urgent call. - You can call from the station. - Just give me your mobile. Look, sorry, DS Holt, I witnessed you driving recklessly. If you don't come voluntarily, I'm going to be forced to arrest you. Hello, Stuart. How do you think this works? You ask for forgiveness, then you're free to maim and kill again? Sonia's dead because I misunderstood what the Lord was asking of me. I failed. This time the message is clear. Rebecca again. Ring me, Ben. Where's Hedley? What's happened? Where's Christian? I tried ringing him. - Don't know. He didn't take his phone. - Can't get hold of Ben or Callum, either. Respectful, by-the-book Callum, and now he's not answering my calls. 44 minutes. Perhaps it's all been leading to this from the very first day. Tell me I'm insane. Tell me that's not possible. Not sure I can. Oh, God! Well, what do I do now? Well, you still have the numbers 1,2,4,5. The heart The bullet hole. It's not a bullet hole. According to Christian, it's a spontaneous explosion. I don't know what use that is. What about the website? Doesn't work. Hang on. What would you say you like most about being a scientist? There are no answers, only more questions. 28th March. Must have been a college visit. Bevan College. Why didn't he tell me? Well, I doubt he'd remember. - Not till he'd seen the clip. - So he thinks, what? He can stop this by himself? Well, you know Christian He's a very private man. This isn't a scientific theory, it's not a code to be cracked. It's about him, about his life. I was right. We're not the players. We're the game. 43 minutes. If I stay here, five students die. If I go... I might kill them. Crashed? Where? So there's nothing to worry about, is there? They're in custody... I'm sorry too. I love you. - Hiya. - Come in, sit down. Thanks for coming. That was nice. Yeah. See you. I'm going to this meeting. Peace Movement. I'd give it a miss, only Jase is infatuated with the Depwell Gang. I need people to know whose side I'm on. - I could go with you. - OK. I have to get there, now. You deliberately drove into a car containing three people, including two minors. I thought Zac Hedley was in the car. I was trying to stop him. You could have killed them. Jesus, Ben, what's happened to you? I don't know. John 15, verse 16. Jesus said... "You have not chosen me. I have chosen you." This is not my decision, Stuart. Ssh! Help! Help me! Only God and I can hear you. I didn't touch her. You raped and murdered Sonia. An innocent man was arrested. You've got this wrong, OK? I didn't say because... it was a secret. She told me to keep it secret. We were in a relationship. We were going to get married. Kids, everything. By the time forensics prove Sonia was dead when her boyfriend found her, the trail to you will be cold. She was mine. I loved her. Why shouldn't I love her? I can't risk you getting away with this, not again. Without justice, what are we? Our sins will catch up with us, Stuart. If not in this world, then... in the next. - Argh! - Shh... ssh... One witness, that's all we need. Dr. King? What are you doing here? Shit. You have to cancel the meeting. Get these students out now. - I don't understand. - I can't explain it. It's Jason, isn't it? Jason Hedley? I've come for the meeting. 1-2-4-5. You have to get these students out. And let the little bastard think we're scared of him? That him and his cronies can get away with murder? If he wants to be part of the meeting, great. Don't provoke him, he has a gun. Oh, God, what's he going to do? Please, please. I'll say I'm calling off the meeting. - It's too late. That may panic him. - OK. His brother Zac said he was coming. We'll wait for him to get here. Are you OK? Christian, teacher Matt Hughes and five students are in the science lab with an unidentified younger boy. No sign of Leah. - Can you see a gun? - No. - Firearms unit's on its way. Leave now. - That's crazy. We need someone on the ground here until they arrive. As long as I stay out of the room... OK. Brief them when they arrive. But don't move beyond the corridor. Well, what's happening? - Leah? - What are you doing here? Zac? Zac Hedley? Stop. You can't go any further. - Why not? - You can't go in there. Get off me, let go! You can't go in there, your green top. - Let go! - Leah, no. - Jason... - Leah, no. What are you doing? Got to ruin college for me as well? Zac, please. You think you're a punk because the Depwell Gang let you trail along behind them? They don't give a toss. They just boast they've got - a villain's son in their crew. - That's not true. Dad's a loser. Haven't you worked that out yet? - He's in prison, you thick retard. - That's enough. You've got nothing. No respect, no brains, nothing. Yeah? What's this, then? Do something. Stay where you are. If they charge in, there's going to be a real mess. They're last resort. You know that. Stop him. Let me through. I have to get in. Sir, come on. Ben. Is Leah here? Is my daughter here? Jason, please, put the gun down. Or what? Nothing's happened yet that can't be put right, Jason. Dad wouldn't want this, Jase. Remember what he says... a gun's a tool, not a toy. Put it down. We're family, mate. We don't need Depwell. Put it down. Please, Jason... Aargh! A-a-argh! Shit. What? I didn't do anything. That wasn't me. Get back! - He needs help. - He's played a trick. He's faking it. Stop it, Jason. Matt's having a heart attack. We need to get him to a hospital. - They'll say the retard did it. - It's not your fault. Get up, get UP! Matt needs urgent medical attention, Jason. The paramedics won't be allowed in while you're still holding that gun. They'll send in armed police. Do you understand what that means? We don't have much time, Jason. In two minutes, one of those windows will explode. - It'll sound like a bullet. - What? It's called a spontaneous explosion. Whatever happens after that, you must stay calm. What are you talking about? You're messing with my head! - Listen to him, Jase. - Shut up! - Don't shoot! - Your dad put my dad away! - You like secrets, Jason? - Rebecca... I know a brilliant one - how to change the future. One future - armed police come through that door, you panic and people die. Maybe even you, Jason. But there's another future. You put the gun down, you stay perfectly still and you start your life again. Please, Jason, put the gun down. Help me, please. Somebody help me.
