 Usly,I need you guys to be "belspot-checking in here.... I came up like a goddamn navy seal. There's some things that are gonna change. - This boat is starting to actually look like ciara and paget's apartment. - Mm. Paget and I have been dating for four years. Have you checked the winches and everything? - You ask me now? When ciara and I have worked together in the past, I had a hard time controlling my temper.

 So I know this time, I have to hold myself in check. Can you stop assuming everything and trust me? - This is my first time working with anyone. I was a sole stew on a 30-meter. Youtube tutorial, pinterest pages, that is how I learned to do my job. - Good morning, ladies. - For me, with a chef, if they're really good at their job, they're hot. - Enjoy. - Thank you. - I just want to hang out. - Parker's a sweetheart. - All you have to say to me is "bacon," and I'm there. - She's like, "bacon," oh! - Ooh! I'm no yacht a flirt, I'm vivacious.

 [ laughs ] - what kind of mood? First night out, the chef and the chief stew are getting together? This could be a disaster, and I've got front row seats. - Time to go. [ laughs ] - jacuzzi's over. - Wait a second... Ooh. - What the [bleep]? - This sucks. Where's your room? - Where's your room? - Do you want me to go to my room? - Yes. Chief stew and chef? We gotta pump the brakes. - Good night. - Okay. - I don't think it's the smartest thing, to just dive in head first day one. - What the [bleep] is going on? - Is there any girls in that cabin? - I don't think so. - I'm sure there's something suspicious going on. - Between who? - I'm not sure, I haven't worked it out yet. - Hey, guys. - Hi. - What's up. - What did I miss? - I got to sit up in the hot tub full of people that... - Also our chief stew has been passed out in her bikini on the bed. The chef and the chief stew... If this goes wrong, we are definitely ----ed. - What are you gonna do? - That's why is topped drinking. - Where's your man? - I don't know, probably in bed. - You don't know? What the [bleep] is that about? I'm a married guy, I live through you young guys. - All right. - All right, go to bed. - I wanna go outside and breathe outdoors. - Yeah, let's go, let's go. Whatever her heart desires, man. - [ sighs ] you coming down here? All right, I'll come down. If you'll get in a big fluff about it. [ ukulele music plays ] - dude, look at this dope sh--. This couldn't be any better. I'm in greece, on a... - Dude. - ...Sick-ass bond boat. And you're gorgeous. - I appreciate you. I never get crushes, ever... Ever. I get to get serenaded, chilling on my yacht? I feel like a charter guest right now. He's just, like, so fun to hang out with. - It's 3:12, I wanna go to bed. - Yeah, it... Yeah, it's 3:15. [ alarm clock blaring ] - what? - Yeah. - No [bleep]! [ groaning ] oh, my god, [bleep] me. [ exhales ] I'm gonna be anxious about it, like, all day. - Oh, my god. I feel like sh--. Ooh. [ groaning ] oh, god. Last night, it got real real, real fast. - Want a coffee, ciara? - Yes, please. - Girl was ready. [ laughs ] - ready for adam. - Oh, dude. - I'm just, like... I'm really ----ing mortified about last night. - She's like, "yeah." - [ groaning ] oh, god, I'm ----ed. I woke up drunk. - Uh, so did I. I woke up in my bathing suit. - Next to a dead seagull? - Yeah. If only. [bleep] that's a classic me maneuver. - Classic jenna. I actually need to sit down for a few minutes. - I'm just happy that paget and I have what we have, so I don't have to deal with any of this drunken hookup bullsh--. - You know what I need? - You don't need shortbread. - Yes, I do. - Okay. - I always need short... Oh, no, it's empty! Who the [bleep] puts an empty box back in here? Ugh! - Paget, jenna, and adam, can you meet me in the mess? We're going to go over the guest preference sheet. - Copy for adam and jenna. - Copy that, glenn. - You guys are already down here, perfect. - Yeah. - Slide it down there. So we have whitney thompson forrester from nashville, tennessee. She's the primary charter guest. I'm gonna put my glasses on and make this a little easier. That's gonna be... Yeah, that's... Oh, much better. Now I can see... Ah. She is taking her tight-knit group of strong, successful girlfriends and her bff jeremy for a luxurious vacation. As a vagan... - Vegan. - Vegan? Vagan? I don't know. - It's just a pain in my ass. - You know, vegan... Am I saying that correctly? I live in a bubble, right? I'm amazed by all this sh-- I see, like almond milk. I don't even know how they milk those almonds. - Two of the guests on this charter are vegans... The primary, whitney, and her cousin hannah. - I can say that this is gonna be a difficult charter for me. If I have a specialty, it's cooking meat. Vegan food is easily my least comfortable cuisine. You put bacon in it, it's gonna taste great. - Whitney and her husband own this successful restaurant, copper vault, and robyn and katie co-own nashville's walden bar. This charter has high expectations for a level of service on board. - On day one, the group would like a lazy day on the water, with sailing. - It doesn't sound like there's gonna be a lot of breeze. We'll figure it out. - On night two, eliza has requested a toga party. - That sounds fun. - One other thing... We've got these nautibuoys, which are inflatable floating docks. We have three of them coming. There's gonna be a nice, big platform out of the back. - Nice. - Thank you very much. - Woo! - Cool. - Cool. Thanks. - Go team. - What time you get to sleep last night, finally? - Oh, like 4:00. I'm good. - Cool. - I'm good to go. I was feeling really overwhelmed on the first charter, just trying not to [bleep] things up. This charter, I really wanna be a valuable team member, help with the sails, drive the tender, and be unstoppable. - I really liked your song last night. It was good fun. - I liked that everybody was, like, vibing. - Yeah. Georgia's voice, though, eh? - Georgia's beautiful... A beautiful voice. - She's beautiful and... - And she's beautiful. - Yeah. - So not only am I hung over as [bleep] I'm trying to figure out my menu. I wanna make something that everyone can enjoy, not just the vegans. - Georgia? I'm missing some underwear. - How many? - At least four pairs. I came with 12... - What? - ...And I have eight, yeah. - There's only so many places it could have... - I know. - Deck, deck, the nautibuoys are gonna be delivered to the back of the boat. - Copy that. - Oh, that one's a bit heavy. Yeah, I'm not doing that... - You don't want that one? - I'm not doing that by myself. - Oh... You gonna show off? Incredible hulk. - What are these things, like just big, inflatable rafts? - They're a pain in the ----ing ass, is what they are. - Oh, yeah. At least we haven't got a water slide. - All crew, all crew, provisions are on the dock. - How'd we do? - Did you find some vegan stuff? - Yes, everything. - Really? - Yes. - Let's rock and roll. - Is that it? - That's it. - Okay. Thank you so much. How hectic are the food preferences, huh? - Pretty bad. There's vegans, there's lactose intolerance, there's shellfish allergies, all sorts of sh--. I am literally ----ed. This spinach is not my favorite. It's like a ----ing pain in the ass. - Oh, man. Last night was super awkward, so I think my best course of action is to just play off like eh, no big deal. Um... Even though on the inside I just wanna vomit all my insecurities onto everyone. - Are you ready for this charter? - I'm scared. - Me, too. It's all on us. - Okay, we're gonna support each other. - Yes, through thick and thin. - We can actually take out our anger on the two other girls. - Till death do us part. - Okay, we've got less than 45 minutes. We've just gotta haul some ass now. - Ludicrous speed! - Where are we at? What's it looking like back there? - I still need to turn some things. - Well, you've got no time to do it now. The guests are coming in less than half an hour. - Paget and I working in the same department, it's becoming more of an adjustment than I thought. We're okay, stop panicking. - I'm not panicking, I'm just saying. - Micromanaging is not an effective way to deal with me, and paget should know this. - If the deck looks crap, it reflects badly on me. - Yes, I know, but you panicking doesn't help. - All stews, all stews, stew meeting in the main salon, please. - Copy that. - Okay, so I know we haven't had a chance to go over, you know, the service-oriented side of things. - Yeah. - So one of the main things is like, you know, how you're carrying your plate. Don't put your fingers on it. Just kinda make it, like, as delicate as possible always be carrying a tray or when you're carrying anything. I haven't had time to really assess my stews, but from what I've seen they can't even carry plates. - Just hold the plate like a normal person... There you go. Make sure that stays literally level, because it's... I'll just hold it. - So that actually really worries me. Any other questions, comments, concerns? Perfect. - All crew, all crew, we can expect the guests any second now. Get everybody out to the aft deck, thank you. - Copy that. - Okay, guys, I see them coming down the dock. - [bleep] - georgia, georgia, georgia, can you see the cold towels? - Yes. - They're under the sink. - Ai-yi-yi. - Coming up... - You do know I'm not actually off my break yet, right? - Come on, ciara, you came up 10 minutes early to give me a hand. - If you wouldn't talk to another deckhand this way, don't talk to me this way. As soon as I'm done with this, I'm going and I'm gonna have my coffee. - Otherwise, I can't function. - Hey! [ engine rumbling ] - I can't hear you! - Watch out. - Oh, my god, I can't do this. My shoes... - Do not wear stilettos. - How are you? - Welcome! - Hi. - I'm glenn. - Eliza, a pleasure. - Whitney, nice to meet you. - Jenna, I'm the chief stew. - Hi, I'm robyn. - Hi, katie, nice to meet you. - Hannah. - Hannah. - Jeremy. - Jeremy. - Do you wanna kick your shoes off here? - Okay. - She's gotta bag the louboutins. - Bag the loubs. - Hi, welcome aboard. - Hi. - Hi. - Can I get you a cool towel? - I would love one. - My name's adam. - Nice to meet you. - I'll be cooking for you. - Great. - Byron, chief engineer... Welcome aboard. - Awesome, nice to meet you. - Pleasure to meet you... Paget. - Parker... Very nice to meet you. - Welcome aboard. - Thank you. - Thanks. - We've got some great activities planned for you. We're hopefully gonna get a little bit of sailing in, if we get the right wind. - Okay. - And jenna's gonna take you on a little tour. - Perfect. - Great, thank you. - Ready for the tour? - Yes! - This is the cockpit. - Rein it in, ladies, rein it in. - This is where you'll be eating most of your meals. - Let's do the luggage. - Follow me up to the fly bridge. - Hot tub! - And here's the hot tub, where maybe you too could make a ----ing fool of yourself. Oh, wait, that's me. So this is a great spot to be sailing. All the sails will come up from here. There's a nice bar. - How many bars are there on this boat? - Three. - Not enough. We have to share! - I love that you own a bar and you're worried about sharing one. - So here we have the inside dining area. Bar... I know that you're happy about that. - An excellent feature. - You have the two twin cabins on either side... - Where's my towel swan? - Did you say "towel swan?" - yes. - There's not a bar in here. - Is that it? - Four more bags. - This is the master. - This is amazing. - Wow, this is gorgeous. - Beautiful. - Glenn, glenn, pag. Are we okay to take the springs off? - Yeah, get 'em off. - So once we start sailing, you can have lunch on the aft deck. - Yeah... - Those two. - Let's go up on deck, to the bar. - Make sure that the shells are facing up. - Where's your beverage? - She's bringing me one. We're not working on the boat. - I just wanna make sure everyone's attended to. - Not my monkey, not my problem. - Oh, god. Ugh. - Okay, hold on. - Hold on... Oh... Great, wet lines. - Okay, glenn, all lines are on. - Excellent, thank you. - Salute. [ grunting ] - I'll have you actually just sit at the table, just because we're gonna bring up the food shortly, if that's okay. - Great, yeah. - You hold on to to the boat, I've got this. You hold on to the boat. - Stop saying it multiple times, I hear you the first time. - All right. - All right? It just makes you sound impatient. - Okay, but I hear you the first time. - Hold on, you need some utensils. - Don't you think they could just take the skewer? - Let's serve it with utensils... Don't touch any food, ever. - Yeah. - Chicken satay! - Yum. - Yes! - Meat! Woohoo! - We're gonna put sails up. - Okay, I'll change, I'll be back up. - Cool. - So, service... You're only carrying two each. - Yeah, two each, hold the edge... That's a very unstable way to hold that. Here. - Okay. - Here, I'll take it, you take one. Let's go. - No, no, no... - Yes, yes, yes, let's go. - Go, go. - How's it all looking, guys? Everything's, of course, vegetarian, except for this chicken. The spring rolls are tempuraed asparagus, spice-roasted chickpeas, and that's all a thai lemongrass and ginger soup. Enjoy your meal. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Mm. - Oh, that's lovely. - The salad is amazing. - The food is dope. - Passed your approval? - Yes, it passed my approval. - Where is the wind? There's no wind. - But you can see there's a little bit of breeze here. I can control everything on this boat, but I can't control the wind. There's a little bit of breeze, not much, but we're gonna do mizzen, main... - Mizzen, main... - ...And we'll pull the genoa out. We need a minimum of about five knots, but even I don't know exactly how the boat's gonna react until I start getting sails up. We're head to wind, here we go. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Fantastic. - Keep a close eye on the donkey as it goes up. - Are we going down below? - Can I try on your one-piece? - Sure. - That's it. - We'll pull the genoa out. Good. We're sailing. We're not gonna break any records. A couple more knots would be perfect, though. Four or five knots, and she can sail. - Let's fly. Can we fly, please? - Can we fly? Yeah, of course we can fly. - Put all the sails up. - They're all up. - No, you still have the motor on. - No, the motor's not on. - Really? - No, we haven't had the motor on... - That's why we're moving so slow. We gotta find the wind. - Find it. Show him how it's done, please. - Gimme your binoculars? - Oh, are you gonna tell us? Here you go. - Those stairs are just gonna kick my ass. - Get that booty. - I'd like to measure my before-and-after success. - I'll measure your success. - Jenna, you were rejected. It's just, like, awkward. Mm, honey. No! - This is way too flat. - It's the wind. We gotta put all the sails down. - No worries. We're gonna start putting stuff away. - The only thing worse than drunk guests are drunk guests who think they know how to sail. Coming down, guys, here we go. Jenna, get those cocktails going. Gotta earn that tip. - Coming up... - I don't wanna hurt his ego. He's a chef, he's delicate. - What happened? - I went to chef school just for this day. - Rosé. - Oh, thanks, jenna. - You're welcome. - So I think I might have some of your underwear. - No, these look like paget's. - I've never done crew laundry on my previous boats, so I'm fumbling through it. But you wouldn't expect it to be so difficult. I didn't want to overanalyze any of you guys' underwear. I just felt like that was crossing a line. So I wanted to ask. - You like panna cotta? - Yeah. - I'm trying to do a vegan one, see if it works. - Oh, we should get in the hot tub. - Are we putting on bathing suits? - So we're gonna anchor in close here, and try to orient the boat so that the guests can see the town. We're gonna try and get that line on one of those rocks over there. Because we couldn't sail today, I wanna have my deck team do a stern tie so the guests will have a beautiful view of agni while they're having dinner. All right, so we're gonna need to get that chain, the shackle... - That's gonna be... - ...And a... It'll be okay. - Are you ready? - No. - You ready now? - No. - Ready? - Yep. - Oh [bleep]. - Okay, everyone smile. - Okay, byron, let starboard go. - You guys, go open the laz door. - Can you start getting that chain out, dude? - Yeah. - Have you stern tied before? - No. - Pretty simple, how it works. So we'll get over there, we'll see what size the rock is, and we'll loop it around. - Dude, all your veins are popping out. - Dude, do you even chain? - Cheers to you, cheers to me. Should we ever disagree, [bleep] you, here's to me. - All right. Well, let's see if we can get it over it. - Throw the chain. [ laughs ] I don't know, dude. - I'm not sure, what's going on? - I don't know. - They must have found a rock they're happy with. - There's no way I'm getting that chain around the whole big-ass thing. - All we gotta do is get me and the chain on the rock. - All right, you're on. - Under pressure, I think I work at my best caliber. There's less time to think. - They've got the right idea. I just hope he doesn't lose his balance. - You got it. - Ooh! It's okay. I got it. - Nice. That will do, mate. That will do. - [bleep] yeah. - It's almost time to have breakfast and get outta here. - Whew! - Jenna, jenna, madison. Would you like georgia and I to change into our nights? - Yes, please. - Are you going down to get ready? - Yeah. - I'll go with you. - I'd like to put some candles up. - Yeah, man. - Here you go. - You can go on break. - Well I'm off, then. - Yeah, you're off, that's it. Go, go, go, I'll do it. - It's pronounced "channel." [ laughs ] - this is amazing. - Wow. - It's beautiful. Look at all the lights on the shore. That's absolutely gorgeous. - Adam, adam, guests are about to sit down. - Sit down, you're rocking the boat. - The easiest way to get me a seat. - Ooh, it is like goat cheese, that's awesome... Vegan feta. - Is that beet juice? Oh, yeah. You're taking it to the next level. - All right, guys. This one can go. How you doing, folks? We've got some roasted beets here. This has got some local vegan feta cheese, along with some candied nuts. Enjoy. - Thank you. - This is ----ing amazing. - Have you tried these nuts? - Nuts are good. - The pepperoni... - Really? - The only thing that has flavor on the plate is the nuts. - What? - Oh, my god, there's so much flavor. - Said the vegans. I love beets, but, like, I like it with stuff that has flavor. - Can't win 'em all. - So hand towel, and then... - Remember to empty the bins, I know. - Yeah, I'm just reiterating. - I feel where everyone's getting off thinking that I'm such a ----ing moron. - Well, tell that to adam. He won't let me carry two plates at once. Like... - I know. It's frustrating. - I think I have, like, a slight authority issue back at catholic school. Didn't like rules. I kept missing catechism classes, which was like bible science... As if we needed to hash that out anymore. I got a kicked out of the catholic church. I just didn't have time for that sh--. I'm good with everyone until they disrespect me, you know? Respect existence, or expect resistance. - I feel your pain. - All good in the hood, man. - Madison, madison, jenna. Can you come serve, please? - Oh, brb. - Honestly, I'd be really bummed out if I were a guest on a boat and the primary was a vegan. Sh--, that's beautifully cooked. Jesus. So tonight for dinner, four of my guests will get juicy, buttery steaks, and everyone else can enjoy their fungus. How was your first course? - So good. I love you. - Beautiful. - I got a medium for you, jeremy. - Yes, thank you. - You got some roasted portobello mushrooms. Enjoy. - Why didn't you tell him when he asked? - Tell him what? - That you didn't like the salad? - I-- - did you not like it? - No, I didn't really like the salad, but it's okay. Nothing had any flavor. - Mm. - Well, did everyone else like it? - Yeah, everybody else loved it. - You did? Okay. - Good night. - Mm. Okay. Have a good watch, okay? I just thought to put the initials next to who I want to do watch. - That would be nice. - Okay. Okay. - So that's for who? - Jeremy's is chocolate... - This is for... - ...And the mango is for... - Katie. - ... Katie. - Well, that would be diary-free, isn't it made with almond milk? - Yes, but she doesn't like gelatin products. Welcome to my life. I didn't study this much when I was in college. All right, let's go. Here we are, folks. Here's a little panna cotta. It's made with almond milk, some fresh berries. - Beautiful. - Some chocolate for yourself, and dairy-free mango sorbet for you. - [bleep] man. - I got you, girl! - Thank you, chef. - What the [bleep] is in this raspberry? What is that? - A blueberry. - A blueberry! - He was, like, you know how I could really wow them? I'm gonna put this blueberry inside this raspberry. - Berries on berries. - Who doesn't love a berry? - That's so ----ing rude. - But it has to be the right size. - That's called service. - If a guest complains about food, it's my job to make sure that the chef knows. But this day has not started well for me, personally, so I don't wanna hurt his ego. He's a chef, he's delicate. - I went to chef school just for this day. - Coming up... - Take your jacket off. - Feels really nice, actually. - Girls sometimes do take that as flirting, but it's not. - She's standing in the galley, have some respect. - I went to chef school just for this day. You know how I can really wow them? I'm gonna put this blueberry inside this raspberry. - Berries on berries! - Who doesn't love a berry? - They're being a bit much right now. - What happened? - Some of the bitchiness is starting to come out. They were like, "did you tell adam that you didn't like the salad?" and she's like, "no, I didn't feel like it." you know when you can just tell somebody's just... - Yeah. - Complaining just to complain? - People suck. Most of 'em do. - It's the drunkenness when this comes up, you know? - Thank you. - I can't decide if I wanna go to bed. - I'm pretty tired. - Parker, what time are you on again? - Four... I'm going to bed after this. - You can go to bed now, dude, I got this. - Good night, and get some sleep, okay? - Good night, you, too. - I put all the cushions away so they don't get wet. I gotta rinse the hold. - Are you looking forward to that list? - Paget and I don't normally work that well together. He just gives me a list and I get on with it. It keeps both of us happy. - Yeah. - How old were you when you met? - He was 22. I think I was 18 when we started dating. God... Ugh. - I'm gonna go to bed. - Good night. - Bye. - You can go to bed now. All machines are done, right? - Yeah. Mm-hmm. - Sound good? - Yeah. - [ groaning ] oh. [ alarm clock buzzing ] - I know. - Good night. After a long day, it's nice to just be a person. To sit down, take my stew face off and put my flirt face on, you know? - Hey, parks, what's up? It's been real, it's been fun. [ alarm clock blaring ] - that's like the healthiest orange I've ever seen. - Good morning. - Morning, glenn. - How you doing? Ah, lovely weather. So it drops off a bit, 4 percent rain at 12:00. - Yeah. - We were thinking of going up north. - Yeah. - We still do the toga party and all that. - Yeah. Coffee? - Yes. - Absolutely. - Glenn, glenn, pag. We're just getting ready to take this line off the rock. - Copy that. - Okay, pull us in. - Dreary day. - Little bit. It's just what I gotta do. - Instead of taking the chain off the rock, we probably should have just taken the whole rock, and then we could go stern to wherever we want. - Okay, glenn, that's the chain off. We're heading back to the boat. Nice. - Yeah, glenn, glenn, that's two on deck, and she's off the bottom. - Thank you. - Everything out, right? - Everything's coming out. - Okay. - You and parker are both out of the cabin now, right? - Huh? - You and parker are both out of the cabin... - Just stand in one place, turn around, look at me. What's the question? - You guys are not in your cabin right now? I'm just checking that you're here, and then I'm checking if parker's here. - I'm right here. I don't know where parker is. What ----ing kind of question was that? - So I just wanted to know if you knew if he was in the cabin. - No, I don't know. I don't keep track of him. - Thank you. Adam seems to have mistaken my inexperience for incompetence, which is really not the same thing. [ knocking ] - I also don't have time for ----ing questions. - Takes three and a half minutes to inflate. - Huh? - Guys, we're gonna be slowing down shortly. Byron, if you can come up and stand by the anchor, please. - Copy. - What can I do? - Watch and learn, really. Once one's inflated, we chuck it over the side with the two lines attached, tie it off to the transom. Tie them so they can literally step off into the nice water. Are you guys happily inflating the next one? - Okay. - She's straight up and down. - Copy that. - Two, one... - Jenna? - Yeah? - It just feels a bit like my lack of experience in, like, a formal setting... - Mm-hmm. - ...Is being mistaken for being incompetent, and I mean, like, adam hasn't seen me do anything wrong. I just haven't given him any reason to be talking to me the way he does. - I mean, you just can't take it personally. I remember hating it when I was a stew, but it's the way that you'll remember it. I expect my stews to be thicker-skinned. I was trained by old-school chief stews. One time I cut the tip of my finger off and instead of getting medical attention, I was told to get back to work and suck it up. - I just wanna make sure that there's no, like, oh, she said this, she said that. - No, no, that's not a healthy way to create a team. - Good talk. - Yeah. - This is sweet. - I'm sure it won't be our favorite thing to do. - Oh, no. No, it's gonna be a huge pain in the ass. - Pull that in that way, forward. - That's what I'm doing, it's just heavy, paget. Please have some patience with me, I'm not as strong as you. - If ciara had another first mate that wasn't her boyfriend, there's no way she would speak to me like that. Three, two, one... - Oh [bleep]. ---Ed up my finger. Yeah, don't worry, my finger's fine, by the way. - So georgia was telling me that she feels like you think she's incompetent. But I just said suck it up and just do what you're told. - I already tried pussyfooting, and I'm not gonna do it. - Yeah, there's no need to. - The galley is my domain. I'm under a lot of stress. I don't need to be coddling and wasting my precious seconds on you. - That's how you sink or swim in this industry too, is if you can actually hold your ground and just ----ing take it. - You gotta learn real quick or get the [bleep] out. - Coming up... - When I wake up and see nothing's been done... - It's not that nothing's been done. You're only looking at the things that haven't been done. This is a completely different side of us. - Ciara, stop ----ing with me. - Georgia? - Mm? - I want you to know that I'm not trying to be hard on you. It's just a learning curve. - Why would you think it's necessary to say that? - I can tell you're frustrated with me. - I'm not being a wimp or anything, but I can also... - I know you're not. - ...Carry two plates at once. - But it's not gonna work for me. At this stage in the game, it's my way or the highway. So just don't complain about it. - I don't have chick friends because this is always the problem. The first time I open up to someone it has to be relayed to someone else and then used against me. It's such a kick in the head. - That's all I got for you. - I love that you came out with your sleep mask on. - ...Inside, just because it's windy and cold. That looks nice. The nuts and that cheese is vegan. The yoghurt obviously isn't. Potatoes, vegan, yes... - So you just leave that there, and I'll take the rest. - Thanks. - This is yummy. - These potatoes are the bomb. - They're happy. - They're happy? - Yeah. - Good. - And the citrus fruit is so good. - Thank you, adam. - This is pretty good... Oh. - I'm just gonna ask you a couple things. Today we could do some watersports, if you're interested. - Yeah, I think stand-up paddleboarding would be really fun. - Okay. And then dinner tonight is a toga party. - Paget, paget, jenna. - Yeah? - A couple of the guests will be wanting to go on the stand-up paddleboard, please. - Copy. - Why do they wanna go paddleboarding right now? It's really sh--ty conditions for this. - Yeah, it's choppy too. - Running on, like, five hours of sleep right now. I tried to do as much as I could last night, and then it became 3:00... - No, you're good. - Normally I do write, like, send some notes like, hey, like... - Do you like my cutting board? - There's a cutting board right there. I mean, if you want it. - I'm done. - Hello, you can come down any time. Just so you know, it is a bit choppy, so paddleboarding might not... Pretty much, yeah. Just let me know when you're ready for them. - Is georgia still in the cabin? - I haven't seen her. - You wanna check on them? - Yeah. - I just want you to monitor. - Yeah. - She strapped on her flotation devices, and in she went. - Make sure, like, the hair shampoo and stuff is just, like, neatly in there and sh--. - Yeah, I haven't gotten there yet. - No, no, I... - Can you take the bag out of the trash? - It's fine, I'll just take everything. Did you iron these rooms? - Um, that one, yes; this one, no. - Um, we have to iron the sheets every morning. - Yeah, I know. - Do you like my hair when it goes frizzy? - You look hot, got that salty sailor thing going. I like that. - [bleep] yes. [ laughs ] whew. ♪ I like the way you sharpen ♪ oh, I actually forgot to put my skort on, it's just my underwear. - Jenna and I have this amazing banter, and it feels great. However, I'm gonna have to spend a lot of time with jenna. Our sinks are shoulder-to-shoulder. We gotta go slow. I just realized I'm half-naked. - Is someone paddleboarding? - Yeah. - All right, eliza. The ocean is your oyster. Recreational activities are definitely where I shine. You're gonna start off on your knees. My parents are associate directors of an outdoor educational school, so I've been a camp counselor for most of my life. - That's okay. Everyone gets wedgies. I was made for this sh--. You want your feet spread apart. - Ooh, yes, she's doing it... Do it, do it. Back straight, knees bent... Start paddling. There you go. Bend your knees. - Vegan pistachio cake, maybe. A few sh--ty comments'll bruise any chef's ego. I'm learning all about this veganism. But despite the fact that I still think vegan food sucks, I'm gonna take it as a challenge, and I'm gonna knock these ladies' socks right off. All right, bakery's closed. - Are you providing togas? - Yep, we have them all. - It's a process, cap. - Let that run out on deck so we don't... - Yeah, I'll take care of it. - Okay, so we need somebody on toga duty. Each person's gonna get that. - Okay, down a meter... Keep coming... Sweet. - I need a test dummy, take your jacket off. It goes... - This feels really nice, actually. - I'm dealing with sheets 24/7. The fact that I'm using something a little bit more aesthetically pleasing than a laundry board, I'm not gonna complain. She's standing in the galley, have some respect. - Paget has a very flirtatious personality. I do know that girls sometimes do take that as flirting, but it's not. It's... - I'm sorry, I have this thing for turning everything sexual, I think. - Eliza, you're giving us, like, strong side boob. - Just hold them up. - Ooh, god, you were born for this. I mentioned it to jenna, so of course she mentioned it to adam. It's just a bit two-faced-y - yes, yes. - And all-girls boarding school. - That's not cool. - Am I, like, hermes? Do I have, like, a tiny wings? - I think it's pronounced "ehrmez." - god, look at how gorgeous this is. I could cry! - Where is the humus? - Why would I know where stuff like that is? I don't know where anything on this boat is anymore. Don't gimme that look. - No, only the real stew. - Why? - Because they didn't have enough togas. - I'm gonna go look in here. [ sighs ] - paget, glenn. Is anyone opening the swim platform? - On my way. I was just getting changed into a toga. - Want me to do it? - No more sheets? - No. - Aw. - I'm sorry. We were kinda like oh, we'll do the two that are doing service, and then one guy. - Ciara, ciara, pag. You have to put the tender on the side, though. [ laughs ] - you do know I'm not actually off my break yet, right? - Huh? - I'm not actually off my break yet. - Well, what does that have to do with this boat? Nothing. - No, nothing, but it's just... - Exactly. Don't talk to me like we're in a relationship. Talk to me like we're work colleagues. - Come on, ciara, you came up 10 minutes early to give me a hand. - Paget... - It's not a big deal. - It is, when I haven't had my coffee. If you wouldn't talk to another deckhand this way, then don't talk to me this way. As soon as I'm done with this, I'm going in and I'm gonna have my coffee. - Otherwise I can't function. [ engine rumbling ] - ...So you can give me a hand. - Okay, I'll be on the side. - Hey! - I can't hear you. - As soon as I'm done with this, I'm going in and I'm gonna have my coffee. [ engine rumbling ] - I will say when you can do that sort of sh-- if I need your hand with stuff beforehand... - Okay, I'll be on the side. - Hey! - I can't hear you. - Have fun. Normally, ciara wins arguments the most, because she's feisty. She's like a little rottweiler. - Hey. - You take it up with you when the ladder's down. - But now it's like I'm the boss, and she needs to respect that. [ sighs ] - oh sh-- girl. - America's next top siren. [ laughing ] - is the captain in a toga? - Oh, my god, please. - Should we go look? - I would die. - That's it for me. - They seem to really like this toga thing. They all got super into it. - Perfect. - Hello, greece. - Hi, greece. - Ciara, ciara, georgia. Come to the crew mess, please. - I'll be there in a few minutes. - You look nice. - Thank you. - I think it looks nice. - It'd look nicer in a toga, which is why georgia's calling me. - Woo, this is a good shot. - Holy sh--, adam, this looks really good. - It's a lot of ----ing work. Everyone has a hard time accepting a new challenge. In this case, I'm forced into a situation. I'm gonna have to kick ass, no matter what. - All right, y'all, come sit. - To-ga, to-ga. - Your worse half is a bit of a [bleep] up, but I think I'll get yours right. - Nipples keep coming out. - It happens to the best of us. - And the worst, apparently. - Let us make haste. - All right, I got hot food down here. - Both hands above your head, please. - You girls look so beautiful. - Aw. - Aw, thank you. - Yep, so that's like that... - We can't fit everything! - Wow, this is a lot of food. - It's a grecian feast. - Take your pants off and you are a greek goddess. - That whole phrase sounded a little bit weird. [ knocking ] - hi. - Hi. I'm in a toga. - So how are we gonna work on deck? - Ugh, whatever. - Smart idea. - All right, you guys, we've got some eggplant over here that's gonna be aubergine; spanikopita, farro salad with feta... That is gluten-free feta... - Send it back, because we need it to be vegan. I'm just kidding. - Roasted cauliflower with spices, yoghurt chicken, lamb off the bone. Hope you enjoy, okay? - Thanks, chef. - Thank you so much. - Right on. - So want me or shall I cabin? - Yeah, cabin, thanks. - Cool, thank you. - That cauliflower... - Is so good. - ...Is so good. - Do you wanna help her with the cabins? - Yeah. - I need you to go straightaway. - You got it. Georgia? Have you already done the master? - No, I only just started. - I will be in here. - How is everything? - This is amazing. - Good. - Holy sh---balls, that was a lot of food. - Is this okay, to take it now? - Yeah. - Have to treat the cushions tonight. - Yeah, obviously. - What's up? - Nothing. - Where you going? - I'm gonna go get cleaning stuff for the hot tub, is that okay? - Yeah, it's fine, but you're being really weird with me. I don't understand. - What, do you wanna have a full-on discussion about it? - If I want to, yes. - Whatever. - What's... - I think you killed it with the food. - Thank you. - It's pretty good when you work with a chef who doesn't suck. - I'm glad I'm a little better than "suck." that's a good place to be. - Tell me... - Better. Way better. - Good job, boo. - Thank you. Well, madison appreciates me trying. At least I have that, right? - Just checking that there are, like, no, like... - The fibers, yeah... - Yep. - I didn't wanna touch it when it's still a bit, like, moist. - Yep. - That's the first time I've used that word in a sentence, and I didn't enjoy it. - Moist. - Oh. That's the connecting end. - Well, it's already connected, so... - Is it? - Yes. - Paget, it is the right hose. - I just hope you guys can get the work done, though, tonight. - I did all this last night. - Yeah. - Okay. There's my answer. - We've been out on the swim platform with the guests all day. You're bitching to me about things that have nothing to do with me. - I have to say something if I don't like something. That's it, get used to it, okay? - Paget and I don't usually let work things turn into a full-blown argument. This is a completely different side of us. - We can't have our standards slip. Because when I wake up and I see nothing's been done... - It's not that nothing's been done. You're only looking at the things that haven't been done. - Well, that's my job, to look at things that haven't been... Ciara, stop ----ing with me. - Next, on "below deck sailing yacht"... - We're going sideways! - Ah! [bleep] - so we have sylvia from boise, idaho, and their one-month-old daughter. - These parents are crazy. - Hi! - Welcome aboard. - That looks dynamite. - You look dynamite. - I'm actually enjoying the casual flirtation between adam and I right now. - This is a professional environment, you two. - It needs to be more round, not deep. - I'm just getting in there. After four years we've been together, you'd have thought I'd get used to the nagging, but nope, here we are. - You're not digging a grave. - Can I get in it? - You're probably gonna end up in it. - The laundry is a ----ing sh-- show. - Why is that line going for? Why did... - He asked for it. - No, that... Get that one off! Get that one off! - Off, off, off. - I need somebody talking to me. I have no reference up here. [ bleep ]
