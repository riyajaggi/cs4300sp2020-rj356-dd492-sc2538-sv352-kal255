 - Sailing on a super yacht is absolutely magical. - All right, sail is coming up. - You are using nature to move a great big boat. - Make sure everything's secure inside. - Yeah. - Still gonna heel over a bit. - I love that feeling you get when the sails go up, and the motor turns off. - We are speeding here. - Okay everybody, we're going to get a big heel. [ yelling ] [bleep] - it also can be quite challenging.

 [ yelling ] - yumma. - Yumma. - I'm sailing. - Greece is the best country for sailing. - Gaios, kassiopi, syvota. [ laughing ] [ yelling ] - it's amazing. - This is insane. - Welcome to greece. - Can you climb up and have a look at the break on the main? - As a captain, I love being on parsifal iii. Coming out on the jenny. Keep an eye. She's 180 feet long, 200 foot mast. I prefer to be on sailboats,

 because getting there is part of the fun. - Who's driving this thing, anyway? - Oh sh--. [ laughs ] - I've worked on sailboats and motor-yachts. Sailboats are even harder. I enjoy a good challenge. So here we are. - You can have four if you want. - This is what needs to be organized. It's literally a sh---pile. I'm not here to coddle you or to give you a ----ing participation award. Wanna keep crying? - Without me running the deck... I'll tell you when to throw the line. - Okay. - There wouldn't be a deck. - Don't pull me, pull then tender. - I'm not pulling you. I don't really let people underestimate me. - Don't get frustrated. - I'm not frustrated. I honestly don't know if the boat would function without me. Parker, come on. - Look. - Lightning round. Stop the lightning round! I'm the facilitator of a good time. - I want to be like you're that girl, but there's no girl that does that except for you. I wasn't planning on loving the whole yachting industry as much as I do. - Okay, how much time do I need? - Depends if you want it medium rare or well done, really. But I party like a rock star. I drink like a sailor. I was born for this sh--. Ready for the walk of shame. - I am lord byron. I fix things. - Sometimes. The three fundamental rules of engineering: Always use the right tool for the job. A hammer is always the right tool. And anything can be used as a hammer. - The ocean is your oyster. I am the james bond of the sailing yacht world. I've got my gadgets. I've got beautiful women. If sh-- goes down, I can figure it out. I think. - How is that ready? - I'm going to do it after I get this snaked. - What do you guys doing? - It's fine, ciara. - Take it off the winch. - Grab the tender, quick. - Get that one off. - [bleep] me. - What I'm saying has to go, and that's the way that it is. - I like you. There's gotta be something there. - I do not get pissed off. I am pissed off. - Tie it on. Tie it on. - It's-- - we touched the dock. - God damn it. - I don't want it to snap, paget. - Oh, that's classy. - I've been captain on parsifal for 10 years now. Over that 10 years, we've been a very busy charter boat. But for the past nine months, we've been in the off charter season. So we had no guests on board, and a skeleton crew to get everything ready for the next charter season. - What belt are you wearing? - I'm gonna wear the brown one. You've gotta help me because I'm not really that good at clothes. When we were in the offseason, I brought in ciara and paget. Paget was running the deck, and ciara was running the interior. So ciara, paget, and I are like the core family of parsifal. - Thank you. - You're actually funny. - Paget and I have been dating for four years. We were friends for a long time. We started working together. Then we moved in together to save money. And then we decided to start dating. - Oh. No, no, no. - Here we are four years later. No, I don't understand that either. - Okay, so as you guys know, I've been looking for some extra crew. I think we've got some really good people coming. - The best people are on board already. - Exactly. - You might regret saying that later. - I probably will. - You know, this is a big change for us. Boat's still a little bit of a mess from all the stuff we've been doing, all the prep. Now we're in charter mode. And as you guys know, I've decided to put ciara on deck for this season. I know she's a stewardess, but she's also done decks too. - I've worked on deck on a lot of small boats, so I know what I'm doing. And on this boat, I'm kind of the mom on board because I know the boat inside and out. But paget and I have never worked in the same department. We'll see how it goes. - We're gonna have people start rocking up pretty soon. - I'm feeling a little bit nervous about meeting the new crew. We did have this family between glenn, myself, and ciara. So yeah, the new crew coming on board, it feels weird. - How am I doing so far? Do I get an a for effort? - Maybe it's easier if you do it like this. You'll get right tired. If you want to just do that. - Okay. I don't really need a pole that long. - That's what she said. - Hello. - How you doing? Guess who's back? - Paget, nice to meet you. - Adam, nice to meet you. After a solid year of driving around in my van with my dog, cooking over an open flame, I'm still the same grumpy dickheaded asshole that I've always been. You guys got your work cut out. - Yeah. - I'm happy focusing on my food right now, being single, and not having to share my bunk with anyone. - Pleasure to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - I'll be doing some cooking for you. - Hi. - How's it going? - This is ciara. - I'm ciara. - Adam, nice to meet you. - All right, let's get the uniform going. Oh. - The galley. - The domain. - Yeah. - I got my work cut out for me putting it together. Oh, god. - Howdy. - Hi, how you doing? - Good, how are you? - I'm glenn. - Jenna. - Oh, jenna. - Nice to meet ya. - Where you coming from? - Canada. - Wow, I grew up in montreal. How about you? - Sioux ste. Marie. When I was starting out, I worked for this hardcore michelin-star trained chief stew. I came up like a goddamned navy seal. So now I have such high standards, everything should be perfect. - Jenna. - This is ciara. - Nice to meet you. - Hi. - Adam. - How's it going? - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. He's cute. - People are arriving, so we'll start figuring out their cabins. I'm in the starboard aft. I'll have the chief engineer in with me. And then ciara and paget are already in the starboard forward cabin. They're a couple. - Okay. - So if you have any questions, ciara will be able to show you around. - Okay, cool. - Cool, cool. - Guess I'll have a look at these cabins. - Hi. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. I'm paget. - I'm madison. What's your name? - Paget. - I'm made for yachting. I'm an energizer bunny. I run on caffeine and candy. Little bit of sweet tarts, little bit of coffee. I'm good to go. So nice to meet you guys. - Nice to meet you, too. - Are you traveling light? - Everything did fit, like, really neatly, and then I, like, obviously had to make room for candy. Obviously the most important thing, right? - Exactly. - Gotta have sustenance. I try not to overwhelm people with my energy, but then it's kind of like natural and I'm like I'm so sorry. - Hello. - Hi, how's it going? - What's your name? - Adam. Nice to meet you. - Adam, madison. You're really cooking the grub? - Yeah. - Appreciate you. I'm like, how you doing. And they're like okay, you're a lot. - Did you meet madison? - Lot of energy there. - There's a lot of energy, yeah. - Obviously this is the main salon. - Everything's like ah. - It's very, very open. - No, I mean, like sh-- everywhere, but. - These are outside deck cushions, so these will be going out. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course, yeah. - Prior to this season, we had a lot of maintenance to do, so the boat's not charter ready. And I'm not gonna pretend like it is. Do you like the new teak? We did that. These have all been depilled. They're still a little bit to do. There's a couple bad ones. - So the deck does that? - No, the interior manages it, so that's fun. - Well, that could change. - Hi. - Hey. - I'm paget. - Paget. Georgia. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Where you from? - I'm from south africa. Where are you from? - England. - Ah-ha. - Yeah. - I've been told I have a fake accent of yours. - A little bit, yeah. - Yeah. - Sounds like you're trying. - I'm definitely not british. My mom studied in the u.K. Then she came back to south africa and raised her children with fake british accents. - I take it you're a stew? - Gotta be. - Steward, okay, cool. - I do get more british when I drink. I am apparently the queen of England by midnight. - Hello. - Hey. - What's your name? - I'm georgia. - Madison. - Paget, paget, ciara, there's still some luggage on the dock down here. - Should I put this on immediately, or do we wait until we meet the chief-- - no, you have to put it on. - Put it on. Got you. - Chief who? - Chief-- this is chief. - Are you chief? - This is chief. - Told me-- I thought I was supposed to meet you-- - is there a body in that, or what do you reckon? - Is it a sh---show? - Yeah. - Oh, great. - Like a lovely sh---show. - Who the [bleep] packs this much to go on a sailboat? - In a hard bag. - Do you wanna take a minute to, like, see what you can do on that laundry? - See what we can? - Yeah, do the ----ing laundry. - Thank you. - Hey, how's it going? You look just like the chief engineer, but you're obviously a guest. Byron is part of the extended parsifal family. He worked on the boat five years ago. We're really good buddies. So you remember the old girl? - Yeah, boat looks good. I like the way you've done the cushions there in the middle. That's cool. I'm married, and I have a one-year-old daughter, saphira. It's never easy to leave my family. But coming back to a boat that I know makes it a little bit easier. Is this me? - I think that's you. Unless you wanted the big one and I'll just-- I'll just climb up there. - I'm on the bookshelf, right? - I'm kind of used to this one. This one forms to my body - I think you're twisting it the wrong way. - No, I'm not. - You're making it worse. - Shut up. - Parker. - Yeah. - Glenn. Is that all you have? - Yeah. - Wow. - I learned how to sail working at summer camp. I grew up racing lasers and sailing hoby cats in hawaii. So I'm confident on smaller boats. - Adam, nice to meet you. - What up, adam? - Yeah, pleasure. I think I might be your roommate. And I come to the room smelling like garlic most nights. - That's okay. I like garlic. - All right, good. - There's a lot of stuff on a super yacht that I don't know. But I know a lot about sailing. And right now, this is my dream job. - I'm paget, first mate. - I'm parker. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Right on. - Okay, let's go have our meeting. - Let's do this jam. - You must be parker. - I am parker. - Hi, ciara. - Ciara? - Nice to meet you. Do you want us to sit on the floor so we can look up at you? - No, you're okay. - Sit on the bed. - On a big sailboat like this-- - yeah. - --This is new for me. I'm pretty green to the yachting industry. - Okay, no worries. - Tell me what to do, and I'll do it, all right? - It's washing-- - if I have any questions-- - yeah. - --I'll ask them. - No worries. - For sure. - Do ask. Yeah, yeah, for sure. - My management style. I never want to intimidate. I never want to make people feel bad. - I love that. - I'm pretty forward. I'm pretty direct. I don't think I'm a bitch by any means. But I hate my authority challenged. And I'm not saying you can't have an opinion. But for the first couple charters, please just follow my lead. - Just do it. - That's for the best. - Yeah. - I'm kind of like the energizer bunny, like-- - really? I couldn't tell. Ah! - What? - No, I really don't get tired, and like, I'm kind of one of those things where I'm like-- - yeah. - --I'm here to make your life easier. And you are the chief stew. - Yes. - So like whatever you say, 100% dude. I'll go do it. - I was the sole stew on a 30 meter. This is my first time working with anyone. - Oh, that's-- - so I know that I'm going to know the least out of anyone. - A lot of the stews that I've worked with are soft. They're like, well, it would just be really helpful if you told us the positive things with the negative. I'm not your mom. I'm your chief stew. My primary focus is the guest satisfaction, not whether or not you feel happy or loved by me. Everything is just kind of all over the place. Start in the master, work out some energy, start vacuuming like that. - Have you come far, then, for this? - Yeah, I'm from maryland. - Ciara, where's maryland? I don't know much geography. - It's on the east coast. - Right in the middle, - what is that? Like, this is-- - I don't know. - Sh-- everywhere. - Do you remember ever in school like-- - never been in school. - Any grade school whatsoever? - No, I was homeschooled. I grew up on a 45 foot catamaran. I had been living and/or working on sailboats since I was 15. My parents, they talked about sailing since before they even had kids. They took like a three-day sailing course just for the fun of it, and decided to move the whole family to Spain to go live on a sailboat. But they didn't actually know how to sail. They hired paget on board to teach them about sails. And that's how we met. - The first couple boats that paget and I worked on were catamarans. - Cool. - Okay, I don't know what the [bleep] this is. - The part that really confuses me is there's people from the boat here. - I know. - I'm like. - I'm like, what the [bleep] is wrong with you? - What the [bleep] have you guys been doing? I've seen this before, where the boat sits on the dock for too long. The crew gets very sedentary. I mean, this boat is starting to actually look like ciara and paget's apartment. I know you guys are all friends, but... It's not the same boat anymore. - There's some things that are going to change. - All crew, all crew, can I get everybody up to the flybridge? We're going to have a quick meeting. - Copy for us outside. We're already here. - Copy for the girls. - Get everybody over here. - What's up, squad? - I just want to welcome you all aboard. First of all, I'm a pretty laid back person. I like to hire people that are good at what they do, and give them ownership of their departments, and try to stay out of their way. - Last season the med, I was perpetually under a microscope with sandy. - Adam, the primary said her preference sheet was ignored. - Lies. It is impossible to serve each of these preferences. - What does service have to do with food? - My toast was ready. - All right, now I'm getting pissed. I'm not gonna tiptoe around you. If I'm not happy with the ----ing toast not coming out on time, don't say I don't need help. - So it feels really good to be working for someone that actually trusts the crew. I guess the big question is, whether or not he's gonna be able to trust us all season long. - If anyone's having any problem with anyone, speak to your department head first. But if it's an issue, definitely come see me. Starting the season tomorrow. There's a lot still to do to get ready. - Yeah. - So cool, cool. - Cool, cool. - Thank you very much. - Let's do this jam. - What in the [bleep]? This is a disaster. - Is anything labeled? - It's an s or five. The boat is a [bleep]-show. Every single guest cabin is filled with linens and extra blankets. So many single sheets. - Hey, byron. Does the grill work? It's been on for about an hour, and it's still cold, so I don't think it's working. - No, that's not right. - We have a super-tight timeframe. We don't have enough people. - ----Ing hell. - Okay, there's space there. - Parsifal iii looks like gisele bundchen on the outside. On the inside, she looks like a 2007 britney spears. - Oh. - We're ----ed. - Coming up... - Our first charter of the season. - We're gonna start sailing shortly. - And we have to get all the sails up. That's the true test. - Stop, stop, stop. - The sail is out of the track. - Sh--. - Turn around for a boat this size usually would take more than a day without having to sift through inventory. - Yeah. - Booyah. - Just those plugs, huh? - Yeah. Disconnected for some reason. Is it getting hot? - Yeah. Thank you. - Dude, I can't wait to sail. That is gonna be so cool. - Paget, jenna, and adam, can we get together for a preference sheet meeting in the mess? - Oh, my god. - Copy for adam. - Copy. - Copy. - Can you reach the rest of that? - Our first charter of the season. - Sweet. - We've got alan and jennifer ward. Alan was a high level software engineer at apple before he retired. - They look lovely. - They do look lovely. - Joining alan and jennifer are their daughter, emily, and her friend peyton. Rounding out the guest list are alan and jennifer's close friends, alessia, an italian model. - Yes. - And guy, who owns a beach club in indonesia. Alessia and guy are getting married the day before the pickup. - Wow. - So they're getting married today. So we're gonna have to think of something special for that. - First night, they want to celebrate emily and peyton's recent college graduation during dinner with champagne and cake. - Just seems like everyone wants to do a greek spread. Also looks like we'll be doing sushi at some point. - Alan and jennifer wants to enjoy adventurous activities like sailing. - Check. - Considering this boat just looks like it's been boarded by pirates, I don't give a [bleep] about who likes lobster and who doesn't. There's still trash bags everywhere. - So, we're good. - Yep, let's wrap it up. - See these? - Yeah. - These seats are missing. - That one right behind you? - That's it. A low center of gravity really helps. Boom. Done. Where's the next one? Oh, I see it. - Oh, there you go. You don't have to be short to spot that. - You two are a riot. - Well, she's short. She can't see over the chair, so actually, being tall helps. - You two are a riot. - Being in a couple in yachting can be a negative. It can be. Ciara and I are very aware that we don't want to be that stereotypical couple that are always cuddling in the crew mess which is unprofessional. But we're not like that. - I think you're perfect for each other. - Have you ever dated anyone in the industry? - I was like seeing like this one guy last year. We got two tattoos together. - Oh, sh--. Oh, that's serious. Who is this guy? - How many drunk tattoos do you have? - I have five. And I have two sober ones. I'm kind of like responsible with myself when I'm drunk. So I'm like, madison get it somewhere no one's gonna be able to see it. Says meow. I hate cats. - So do you still talk to him? - No. - That's really sweet. - I love a drunk tattoo. - All crew, all crew. Provisions have just arrived. Let's get everyone out on the dock. - Copy, copy. - Copy. - Dope. - More. - Why didn't you use the handle? - Because the handles could break, is the thing. - Oh, croissants. - We're running out of space in here. - Um. - I'm a hands-on captain. I mean, one-ninth of the provisions coming on board I'm going to eat. So if something needs doing and my hands are free, I will pitch in. I think that's normal. - Is that it? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Yay. - Woo. - I suppose all we have to think about now is, like, not slowing down, because we're tired. - How you doing down there? - There's sh-- everywhere. - You've got to get it done, but you also got to get some rest. - I know. We'll call it at 11:00. - How's it going out there? - Ciara's taken to it like a duck on water. - Fantastic. - She's been fantastic. Parker's nailing it, so. - That makes me feel really good. - I need to know, too, be comfortable serving on your own. - Oh yeah. - Okay. - On this size with a three stew team, you guys are in cabins and then come up to assist with delivering the food. - Okay. - I warn you, I am going to be like bam, bam, bam and just say it how it is. - Anything else, paget? - No, we're looking good in the bow. - Okay. - We'll continue again tomorrow morning. Go and have some dinner. - Okay. - So in the two twin cabins, what needs to be done in there is the bathroom, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Honestly, we gotta go to sleep, because it's just too much. We'll get it done tomorrow. - So how do we get up and down here? I don't want to wake you up if I step on down, you know. - Nah, don't even worry about it, dude. - I'm gonna brush my teeth. - I sleep like a log. Don't worry about it. - Yeah. - Dude, bro. - Yeah, those are good. - You guys are like the bros. Your cabin's called the bro cabin. - Dude, we're gonna have so much fun. - Clearly. - Yeah. - Dude. Sweet. - Bro, you got a button up I could wear? - Bro, I got plaid. I got flannel. - I feel like, you'd be getting ready in the mirror, and you'd be like, oh damn good, and talk to yourself. - I don't do that-- - I could hear him saying that. - I know. - --But I've been told I definitely have, like, a distinct mirror face. - Because you like-- - I think everyone does. - It's like this. - Everyone has a mirror face. - That's-- - and then I'm out. - Oh, bro. - I'm so stoked. - I have a feeling we're gonna have lots of late-night talky-talkies. - Night, guys. I love you. - Night. Love you. - Snuggy-snuggy. - Snuggy-snuggy, huggy-huggy. [ alarm buzzing ] - let's do this thing. - Can you guys come in here and we'll have a little meeting? - Aye, aye. - We're gotta wipe the beams again with vinegar. Give me some slack on the stern line. - Oh, like a glove. - You guys need to go down into the guest cabins. I honestly want everything to be like ----ing immaculate. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Cool. - Cool. - Break, let's go. We can do this. - Yes. - Can you come here, paget? - I don't think it's correct. - I need you guys to be spot-checking in here. I'm looking to see if my girls have that attention to detail, which is so imperative in this position. We need to fill the soap, but I have that on the list. Are you looking at the glass from every angle to make sure there's no spots on it? Are you looking at every spot on the floor? You can take that vacuum and just swipe it all along here. If they're paying attention to these small details now, then I know I can trust them moving through the season. - Later when they're on board and we have time. - Okay. - Is the master done? - Master is good to go. - All crew, all crew, if you haven't already, switch into your grey polos, please. - Ah! - These columns need to be done. - Yeah. - You've got like three minutes left. Let's do it, huh? - Girls, girls, girl, can you grab the champagne and cold towels? I think they're arriving any minute. - Coming down the dock now. - Oh [bleep]. - It's a big boat. - They're coming down the dock, so I need you right, right, right away. - You guys excited? - So excited. - I count four people. - Uh, yeah. - It's got little sails up. - Yeah. - Where are the other two? - Coming up... - We were wondering if the hot tub is going to be available. - Of course. - Doesn't feel like 24 degrees. - No, it's cold. - The boat has been sitting for nine months. Anything that goes wrong, that's on me. Jacuzzi water's cold. - [bleep]. - Yeah. - Absolutely. - Alessia and guy are getting married the day before the pick-up. - Hello. - Welcome to corfu. I'm glenn. - Hi, alan. - Nice to meet you, alan. - Jenna. I'm the chief stew. - I'm peyton. - Emily. Nice to meet you. - We were expecting two more. - They're delayed. They're on a plane on the way to athens right now, and hopefully will be here later today. - We'll figure it out. - Welcome aboard. - All right, thanks. - Welcome aboard. Paget, the first mate. - Alan, nice to meet you. - Hi, adam. Pleasure to meet you. - You must be the chef. - That's me. - Welcome. - I'm adam. - Nice to meet you. I'm georgia. I can't shake your hand, but I can give you a towel. - Great. - Emily. - What's up, emily? I'm parker. - Nice to meet you. - Would you like some champagne? - Cheers. - Cheers. - I would like to formally welcome you aboard parsifal iii. - Thank you. - Thank you very much. - We're excited. - Looking forward to having a great holiday together with you. Hopefully you're going to get a little bit of sailing in if we get the right wind. - And I would love to give you a tour. - All right. - Look out for the lines, and watch your step. - This is the cockpit. You'll probably be having lunch here. Dinners out here. - We love to eat outside. - Yes. Flybridge area. When we sail, make sure you're holding onto something. - Here's your wheel. - I know. - We've got a hot tub. - Huge. - Ciara, want to give us a hand with the luggage? - Coming up now. - Just be careful on the steps. Main salon. - This is huge. - Follow me down these stairs. - Everything is so beautiful. - Isn't it pretty? You wouldn't have said that yesterday. - So we have twin cabins. Come into the master. - Wow, this is nice. - Bathtub. - Whoa. - Holy moly. - This is beautiful. - Yeah. - That it? - Yeah. - It's perfect. - Those in there. - Okay. - All crew, all crew, we're going to make ready to get underway. - That is the mightiest cheese fork I ever did see. Cheese. - Thank you so much. - Glenn, glenn, pag, are you happy for us to take the remaining lines off? - Yeah, go ahead. - Copy. - Deuces. - I feel like they're going to be the nicest people. - They're like literally not gonna say anything about-- - cheating. - I can't believe how calm the water is. - Glenn, we're now slipping your last line on port side. - We're going to take these lines away, correct? - Yes. - I told you I'd ask a lot of questions. - I'd rather you asked questions than break something. - Hey, glenn, all lines are up. - Copy that. - I think a lot of people think sailboats sail everywhere, which is not true at all. The vast majority of sailboats also have a motor, and you always need the motor to get in and out of port. - You can see your wind here. So if we find some wind, put some sail up. With all the new crew, I'm quite impressed with how easily we got off the dock. But it's going to be interesting to see when we have to get all the sails up. That's the true test. - Oh, we're moving now. - We might go sit up on the bow. - We'll see you guys up there. - Hey, we're gonna sail soon. And I can see a little bit of breeze out here. - Okay. - If you want to do a little bit more stowing, a couple things that might slide. - Okay. - So we're gonna start sailing shortly. - Yay. - Oh, that'd be great. - All crew, all crew. We're gonna get some sails up. - Copy. On my way. - We're a sailboat, and people who come on board a boat like this, they want to sail. So I expect my crew to be ready to go sailing at any moment. - We're about to go sail, and there's like 500 things that are about to fall. - I know. - Which sails do you want up? - Mizzen, main and genoa. - What about plates of food and stuff? - Use this. We should always have these on standby. - Parker, do you want to meet me in the bridge? We'll go out and get some sails out. - Copy that. - Cheers. - Okay, going up. - Just keep an eye on the tension. We want to keep that sail straight. - Looking good here. - Aperol spritzes? - Aperol spritz seems like this kind of moment. - Right? - Okay. Let's get on the main. - You can feel the boat vibrating as she's picking up speed. It's what she's meant to do. - Stop. - Lazy sheet coming out now. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - So we got to put tension on this, because it's like a captive winch. It needs pressure for it to release. - Scoo. - Good. Good. Good. Okay. And then declutch. - Yep. - Yeah, hold it like that. Yeah, see, that's a good angle. - Yeah. - Ooh. - It's fine. - We're sailing. - Coming up... - Have you had steak knives on board? - Not that I know of. - [bleep]. The crew that's been on board didn't have anything prepared for this charter. - Jacuzzi water's cold. - This is embarrassing. - Stop, stop, stop. This sail is out of the track. - [bleep]. - It's so majestic. - Like this is so much more than... - We're not buying one, though, right? - We're not buying one. - You know that. These things cost a fortune. - The sails are up, and I want to cry, I'm so happy. Isn't it pretty? - It's so cool. - It's like so ----ing romantic. - Yeah. - You gonna sail it, peyton? - Oh yeah. Let me take the wheel. I need someone to pick me up and like click me. - Okay, crack your back. - Hey girls, you need to check the guest cabin-- - I know I do. - I will go check cabins. There's just like so much sh-- to do. You know what I mean? - Yeah. - What do you think this angle of heel is? - 24. - 24 degrees? - You'll be surprised. Watch. - 9.1. Feels like more. - Feels like a lot. - Ooh, I see sh-- on the ground. - Where's that coming from? - The icemaker. See, the problem is it's feeding it water, but we're on a tilt. - Oh. - So it can't freeze. - Where can this empty piece of sh-- go? Why not there? - You okay here for a minute? - Yeah. - I'm going to use the bathroom, have a drink of water. - I found salt. - I'll take it. - ----Ing-a, man. I'm always running around like a chicken with its head cut off. I think I've always just been a really hard worker. I think it stems back to when I was a competitive figure skater, like I had to have discipline. And now it's kind of transferring over into my professional world. Solid 324%. Yeah. - We're sol for pepper. I say we do it like silver service, we can have like a little spoon, and then we can like... - Utilize those hands, baby. - Be professional-- ouch. - It's a little hard. - The guests are right behind me. You can't do anything. - Sit down. - I'm not sitting down. - Paget, sit down. - I can't, I'm looking. I'm the lookout. Sorry. - It's okay. - Paget. - Byron's now captain, and he will say what happens? - Yeah, you need to respect your girlfriend a bit more. - Exactly. - That's what he's saying. - So, what are we looking at for time? - Uh, say 10. - Perfect. - As much as I would love to make greek food right now, I gotta follow the preference sheets. They've all asked for sushi. Seared tuna. It's the first charter. I want to get the job done right. Oh, yahtzee. - We're not gonna have a huge amount to do, but we got some touch-ups to do after dinner and whatnot before we go to bed, you know. - Hey, aren't you supposed to be driving? - Um, it's in autonomous mode. - Oh, cool. - It wakes me up after it anchors and I can go for a swim. - Cool. - So, whenever you're ready, you can come down to the aft deck and join us. - Sounds good. - Madison, you're going to come to the galley to help run lunch. - Copy. - Oh, fancy. - Tell me what's ready to go up. - Everything can go. - Everything can go? - Yeah. - Thank you very much. - You're welcome. - We're wondering if the hot tub is gonna be available this afternoon? - Sure. - Thanks, chef. - Mm-hmm. - No. - Just make sure that stays literally level because it's-- I'll just hold it. It's probably better. - No news yet. - How are we doing so far? - Great. - Excellent. You've got some poke salad here. A chinese chicken salad with peanuts and quinoa. - Oh your favorite, emily. - Types of sushi, we've got tuna, salmon, and spicy tuna with cucumber. - All right, thank you. - Thank you. - All right, thanks. - All right, here we go. - Oh, it's really good. - That's good. - It's delicious. - Parker, pag, do you want to meet me on the flybridge? - Copy that. - Can you fit one more into like that? - How is everything? - Fantastic. - It's so good. - Good. You don't need anything? - No. - You are wonderful first charter guests for us. We're so happy to have you. So this is lovely. - Thank you. - Yeah, they're not as nice as us. [ laughs ] - that's okay. That's okay, too. - They should be in athens now. - I picture them arriving by helicopter, and like bungee jumping in. - Yeah. - No, seriously. - Yeah. Seriously? This is amazing. All we want is for you to have fun. That's our main thing. - Thank you. - Oh my gosh, that tuna is amazing. - They're happy. - God, I'm smart. - You're not just a pretty face, adam. - Thank you. - They didn't really like organize this stuff very well. All of this has got to be adam. - All these spices. - We're gonna hide it for now. I don't have time. - Organizing and everything, though. - I don't have time today for that. - All right. - Okay. - My galley is the fraction the size of the typical big motor yacht. Finding a nook and a cranny is like gold, because you're on a sailboat now. Everything's been cut in half. I'll deal with it later. - Paget, jenna. - Yeah, go ahead. - Just wondering what the hot tub temperature is. - I'm saying it should be 24-- it says 24 degrees, but that doesn't feel like 24 degrees. - It's not. It's cold. - The boat has been sitting for nine months at dock, so anything that goes wrong, that's on me. [bleep], it's like embarrassing. Byron, byron, pag. Byron, byron, pag. [bleep]. - Coming up... - Hey, baby. - Welcome aboard. - I've had like four gin and tonics. - We have a captain here. - I'm pretty sure he can marry us. - Let's do it now. Let's do it right now. - We should. - Oh, my god. What's going on with these people? - Byron, byron, pag. Jacuzzi water's cold. The reading's saying 24, but it's not 24 degrees. - I can clear your plate. - Thank you, yes. That was amazing. - Thank you. - You're welcome. My pleasure. - Well, it's full, but the heater's not on. - Oh, that could be it. - Boom. - There we go. - That was your beloved boyfriend that couldn't work that out. - He is blonde. - Hey, paget, paget. The jacuzzi's fixed. There's a switch that says heater. It's gotta be turned to on instead of off. [ laughing ] - wow. [ laughs ] - thanks for that, byron. - Jenna, jenna, byron. The heater's on, but it's gonna take a little while to get hot. - Copy. Thanks. - So the hot tub is not warm yet. We had a problem with the heater, but we are on it. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. The crew that's been on board for nine months didn't have anything prepared for this charter. This is embarrassing. And I still have to sit there with my stew face on, hands behind the back, looking proper. - We'll see you guys out there. - Soon as this guy passes, head to wind, get the sails down. - You see this white long schlong? - Yeah. - We call it the donkey. - Okay. - The top of the sail needs to feed through the donkey. If it's not, it's out of the track. The donkey, that is a layman's term, I believe. But actually, it's called a donkey dick. - Because it's just a long phallus-looking thing. This is called a vang. You adjust it down. The close will fall further forward. - Okay? - Copy that. - Stop, stop, stop. Quite a bit of the sail is out of the track. Sh--, how'd that happen? - Not sure. - It came out of the donkey. - Yeah. - Getting the sails done correctly is one of the hardest things. It's critical that the sail wraps inside the boom just right. If you bring it too far back, you're gonna pull it out of the track, which is a big problem, because how do you unwrap a 60 meter sail and pull it forward? It's a nightmare. - Sh--. - Now it's out. We have to get it back in. - It's not lined up. - I feel bad because right now we can't sail, but I don't like fixing things in front of the guests. Let's just get it away, and we're gonna have to fix that tomorrow when the guests are off the boat. - Okay, I'm gonna keep coming down. It's gonna make it easier to redo it afterward. - Hello? Hello? - Hello? - Hello. - We're here, man. - Get your ass over here. - Great. See you soon. - They're here, the guests. - What? - They'll be here, like tonight. - So shall we include them in the dinner? - Yeah. - Yeah, it sounds like it. - We still have a couple hours before dinner, but we'll make sure that they can join us. - Cool. - Good tzatziki. - So the other two guests are taking a tender over. - Perfect. - Glenn, we're ready to drop. - Start putting it down. - Dropping anchor. - Watch the propellers. - Okay, glenn, that's a shot and a half. - Come and check the thing. - Oowee, that's tight. Good job, ciara. - We have six for dinner. - Yeah, all right. So they're coming. Thought maybe like the marriage didn't quite go as planned. - I mean, I was engaged once. I think there's some huge challenges. - I, too, was engaged once. - Oh, what happened? - Yachting. - I met my ex yachting. And we worked together. All of my relationships for the past 10 years have been really unhealthy. And I think that's primarily because I go for the wrong people. But at this stage of my life, I want to find my person. I can't imagine myself being with him now. Because he-- - it's too much yachtie. - Ah, good times. - Sh--, I can't do this. - Right, wait, cap taught me how to do this. Here. - It's not easy. - I'll push it in. - You got it in. - Just losing my virginity. - I feel like it's the, like-- - need help? Trying to put it away or open it? - Put it back in. It's-- - so it's just a matter of getting it so that they line up. - Caps got it. - Oh, it's not captain's first time. - No, I don't normally play with this stuff, so, I'm not really that experienced. - Glenn, glenn, pag. - Copy, I'm coming. - Yeah. [bleep] - all stews, please change into your evening dresses. - Copy that. - Copy, I'm on my way. Copy that. - Not you, parker. - I think they tie in the back. - Let's blow this popsicle stand. - Oh this blows, all right. - Let's start pulling everything. - Okay. - We need to find the steak knives. - So steak knives. - What the [bleep]? No ----ing steak knives. Okay. Ciara, ciara, jenna. - Yeah, jenna, go ahead. - Have you previously had steak knives on board, and/or did you see anyone's arrive? - Not that I know of. - [bleep]. Are you ----ing kidding me? How did the parsifal crew have been living on board for nine months, not think, hm, we're going back on charter. Maybe we need the basics. - [bleep]. - The only guest cutlery we have is what's in the main salon. - Um, don't know if you heard that. We don't have steak knives. We've looked through every cupboard. We'll have to use crew steak knives. - So the boats a complete disaster. Serving a steak with the improper cutlery in a fine dining scenario is absolutely embarrassing. - It's savage. - That goes here, yeah. - This is really sh--. Are there more steak knives somewhere, like, I'll just take that person's. - It is what it is. - What can I do? - It's a steak knife. - Yeah, yeah. - I can't wait til we have time in between charters. I'm going to make you teach me so much sh--. You're gonna hate me. - No, I'm not. - Yeah, you will. I'm gonna be a rash, dude. I want to do this. - Stop it, stop it, stop it. - When I was working as a sole stew, I never had anybody train me. Youtube tutorials, pinterest pages. That is how I learned to do my job. So, I'd love someone to show me if I've been doing it right all this time. - Warmer? - Perfect. - Fine. - Glenn, glenn, tender approaching at the front platform. - All crew, all crew, we have guests arriving any second now. Let's get everyone that's free out to the aft deck. - Looks like we'll meet them. - Should I be up there or should I be down here? - You're a deck, you should be down here. - You guys look nice. - Oh, we do. - Yeah, baby. [ cheers ] - about time. - All right, it's that kind of party. - We are docked. - I think I know who just arrived. Yeah. - Can I take your purse? - Sorry we're late. - That's okay. - Welcome aboard. Welcome aboard. - Nice to see you all. - Good to see you. - Where's emily? - She's up here. She's-- - come on up, man. - Welcome aboard. I'm jenna. I'm the chief stew. - Hi, jenna. - Congratulations. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, you look beautiful. - Oh, you do, too. [ speaking greek ] - I've had like four gin and tonics. - Only four? - Four doubles. - Okay, let's turn the music up. - Yeah, give us a tour. - Do you guys have any tequila? Let's get this show on the road. - So did you do it, in vegas? - No, we didn't-- we missed our-- - what? - Congratulations. - We didn't get married yet. - No, we didn't-- - okay, well, congratulations for being on board then. Oh my god. What's going on with these people? - He canceled our wedding. - We didn't get to-- we didn't get to las vegas. - We didn't go to vegas. The president was in la mont. - But, you know, but it was... - We didn't get to vegas, so we didn't get married. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - It's -- it's-- - we have a captain here. - I'm pretty sure he can marry you. - I don't know what they're talking about. I hear vegas, something about a president. The bottom line is, they did not get married, and I just know that the person who's going to get ----ed in all of this is me. - Can you marry them? - Ah, I don't know. - She hasn't had enough to drink. Give her some more champagne. - Oh, come on. Let's do it right now. - Okay. - Let's do it right now. - Right now. - Do you have an elvis outfit? - This season on below deck sailing yacht... [ yelling ] - being a sailor is cool. - Whoa. - When you're sailing-- - this is wavy. - Sh-- is just gonna hit the fan. - Please put me down. Please put me down. - I like to think I can handle the worst kind of people there are. - I've been asking for shrimp cocktails for an hour and a ----ing half. - Get the [bleep] off this boat. - Oh. Oh sh--. - Oh! - Horrible idea to hook up with your crew members. - Oh, wow. - You can have him, but you're gonna have to get through me first. - You want a bite? - You're attractive. But I don't need your pee in my vee. - Madison craves the attention, but hates the spotlight. - I have got a system. - Well the system sucks. - Tell jenna she's being a bitch to you, and she needs to back off. - Your attitude is a problem. - It's my way or the highway. Don't complain about it. - This is very thin ice that you're on. - This is the first time we've had this issue. You have ----ed up a few times. If this is what it's going to be like, I don't think I can do it. - I hope he makes the right decision. - Give me your resignation right now, all right. - It's 22 knots. We are going to be heeling to the left. - This is gonna be awesome. - Oh, my god. Woo! - Glenn, we've got a problem on the deck here. - God dammit. - My luxury yacht vacation is pretty much ruined. - We're gonna fix it for them. - Holy sh--. - Do you think it's funny that I'm still breastfed by my mother? Do you think that's funny? - Yeah, a little bit. - All right, well, [bleep] you, then.
